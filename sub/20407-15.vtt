(Male announcer)
This season,
for the first time ever...

00:05.049 --> 00:06.517
This is it.
This is for real.

00:06.584 --> 00:08.151
(Announcer)
Before the Chefs

00:08.219 --> 00:09.186
were allowed to set foot
in Hell's Kitchen...

00:09.254 --> 00:11.455
It's locked.
Let's go.

00:11.523 --> 00:13.457
(Announcer)
They were shown
the prize restaurant.

00:13.525 --> 00:14.725
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>This is L.A. Market,</i>

00:14.792 --> 00:16.093
<i>a multimillion-dollar</i>
<i>restaurant.</i>

00:16.161 --> 00:18.262
One of you will become
the Head Chef.

00:18.329 --> 00:20.531
(Announcer)
And though it was meant
to inspire them...

00:20.598 --> 00:22.266
That is exactly
the place I want to be.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.067
It has my name written
all over it.

00:24.135 --> 00:25.802
(Announcer)
This group initially did
little to impress.

00:25.870 --> 00:27.671
Okay, this is
a seafood pancake.

00:27.739 --> 00:28.972
It's a what?

00:29.040 --> 00:30.040
[Retches]

00:30.108 --> 00:31.608
<i>We've gotten worse now.</i>

00:31.676 --> 00:33.277
We can't even dress
a [Bleep] Salad.

00:33.344 --> 00:35.245
(Announcer)
But right from the start,

00:35.313 --> 00:37.447
it was clear that these Chefs
were the most aggressive...

00:37.515 --> 00:39.216
I'm going to fight
until Chef kills me

00:39.284 --> 00:40.484
or until I win.

00:40.552 --> 00:42.085
Let's do this [Bleep], guys.

00:42.153 --> 00:43.854
Step back and let daddy
take control.

00:43.922 --> 00:44.988
(Announcer)
Relentless...

00:45.056 --> 00:46.123
Cook your [Bleep] Dish!

00:46.191 --> 00:47.524
I'm gonna keep fighting, Chef.

00:47.592 --> 00:49.193
I got it!
I got it!

00:49.260 --> 00:51.361
I'm gonna outperform
all their asses.

00:51.429 --> 00:53.096
(Announcer)
And without question...

00:53.164 --> 00:54.965
You ain't done better
than me at all!

00:55.033 --> 00:57.000
Calm down your little
ghetto attitude.

00:57.068 --> 00:58.335
(Announcer)
The most combative...

00:58.403 --> 00:59.703
You suck!

00:59.771 --> 01:00.637
What the [Bleep]
Have you done so far?

01:00.705 --> 01:01.672
Shut up!

01:01.739 --> 01:03.073
Shut the [Bleep] Up.

01:03.141 --> 01:05.042
(Announcer)
In the beginning,

01:05.108 --> 01:06.810
there was one Chef who was
always in the eye of the storm.

01:06.878 --> 01:08.712
You're a [Bleep] Douche bag.
Don't, bro.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.480
You're a waste of life.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.883
I'm in this situation
where it's me versus them.

01:12.951 --> 01:14.017
(Announcer)
Raj tried to deflect the pain
inflicted by others.

01:14.085 --> 01:16.220
Listen to me.
You all right?

01:16.287 --> 01:17.221
Ahh!

01:17.288 --> 01:18.855
I'm the mongoose,

01:18.923 --> 01:20.090
and the mongoose
is trying to fight the cobra.

01:20.158 --> 01:21.091
Ahh!

01:21.159 --> 01:23.193
Wah! Ah!

01:23.261 --> 01:25.963
(Announcer)
But he could not escape
Chef Ramsay's disapproval.

01:26.030 --> 01:27.798
That is [Bleep] Raw!

01:27.865 --> 01:29.700
Get out!

01:29.767 --> 01:31.568
(Announcer)
Once again,
this season Chef Ramsay

01:31.636 --> 01:33.503
found new ways
to test the Chefs.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.606
[Emergency sirens,
overlapping shouting]

01:35.673 --> 01:38.141
There's your kitchen.
[Horn honks <i>la cucaracha]</i>

01:38.209 --> 01:39.810
(Announcer)
In the team competition,

01:39.877 --> 01:41.044
the red kitchen
clearly dominated.

01:41.112 --> 01:42.279
Well done.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.748
[Cheering]
Go, red team.

01:44.816 --> 01:46.450
(Announcer)
Winning challenge...

01:46.517 --> 01:48.585
Red team, congratulations.
Well done.

01:48.653 --> 01:50.187
(Announcer)
After challenge.

01:50.255 --> 01:51.922
Got to be [Bleep] Me.

01:51.990 --> 01:53.690
(Announcer)
As for the men in blue,

01:53.758 --> 01:55.525
they unfortunately
had the distinction...

01:55.593 --> 01:57.761
You make yourself
look so stupid.

01:57.829 --> 01:59.363
(Announcer)
Of being the worst-performing
blue team ever.

01:59.430 --> 02:00.631
Whoa!

02:00.698 --> 02:02.799
Somebody take control.

02:02.867 --> 02:04.801
(Announcer)
And while they failed
at challenges...

02:04.869 --> 02:06.003
I've never had
such a run of bad luck

02:06.070 --> 02:07.504
in the history
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:07.572 --> 02:09.106
(Announcer)
And dinner services...

02:09.173 --> 02:10.774
Can anyone cook salmon
on there?

02:10.842 --> 02:13.477
You performed
like [Bleep] Idiots.

02:13.544 --> 02:14.978
(Announcer)
They did excel
at something...

02:15.046 --> 02:16.446
He missed scallops.

02:16.514 --> 02:17.714
He's cooked them
in both kitchens.

02:17.782 --> 02:19.149
You snake!

02:19.217 --> 02:20.517
(Announcer)
Blaming each other.

02:20.585 --> 02:22.619
Zero.
Zero, bro.

02:22.687 --> 02:24.621
[Bleep] Pissed.

02:24.689 --> 02:26.189
(Announcer)
There was another Chef
who stood out from the pack,

02:26.257 --> 02:27.557
and that was...

02:27.625 --> 02:28.825
Sabrina.
<i>Sabrina.</i>

02:28.893 --> 02:30.661
Sabrina!
I know what I'm doing!

02:30.728 --> 02:32.529
Everybody thinks
that I'm stupid,

02:32.597 --> 02:34.331
but you know what,
I'm one manipulative bitch.

02:34.399 --> 02:35.999
(Announcer)
Everyone thought she would
be gone early.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.434
I'm better than you.

02:37.502 --> 02:38.568
You're gonna go home
before I do.

02:38.636 --> 02:39.836
Watch! Watch!

02:39.904 --> 02:40.937
(Announcer)
But this overachiever

02:41.005 --> 02:42.406
fought for her rights...

02:42.473 --> 02:44.641
I have bigger balls than
any of these [Bleep] Girls here.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.276
(Announcer)
Defied all the odds...

02:46.344 --> 02:47.711
Sabrina,
that's nicely cooked.

02:47.779 --> 02:50.080
Perfectly cooked.
Oh, thank God!

02:50.148 --> 02:52.749
(Announcer)
And surprised everyone
by earning a black jacket.

02:52.817 --> 02:55.118
Congratulations.
I'm so happy.

02:55.186 --> 02:56.420
(Announcer)
Last dinner service,

02:56.487 --> 02:58.188
two Chefs emerged.

02:58.256 --> 03:00.891
Russell, we need a little more
seasoning in the chowder please.

03:00.958 --> 03:02.292
How long you out, Trevor?
Come on, buddy.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.827
<i>Scallops coming.</i>

03:03.895 --> 03:05.128
(Announcer)
And have now taken
center stage.

03:05.196 --> 03:06.763
Finalist number one,
Russell,

03:06.831 --> 03:08.365
started out a little quiet.

03:08.433 --> 03:09.499
Russell, excellent.

03:09.567 --> 03:10.934
Thanks, Chef.

03:11.002 --> 03:12.669
(Announcer)
But once he found his voice...

03:12.737 --> 03:14.037
Come on, bro,
we can't wait on garnish.

03:14.105 --> 03:15.505
It's gonna be no more
Mr. nice guy.

03:15.573 --> 03:16.707
(Announcer)
He never stopped talking.

03:16.774 --> 03:17.908
How long out
on the [Bleep] Scallops?

03:17.975 --> 03:19.776
I'm gonna yell
what the [Bleep] I want.

03:19.844 --> 03:21.311
(Announcer)
Trashing...

03:21.379 --> 03:22.045
<i>It's a disaster</i>
<i>over here.</i>

03:22.113 --> 03:23.847
Boris is a Russian pig.

03:23.915 --> 03:25.816
(Announcer)
And fighting with his
fellow Chefs.

03:25.883 --> 03:27.451
If you talk to me like
you've talked to me before,

03:27.518 --> 03:28.752
I will slap the [Bleep]
Outta you.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.020
Wh--whoa.

03:30.088 --> 03:31.988
(Announcer)
But no one can deny

03:32.056 --> 03:33.557
that he was the most consistent
performer at dinnertime.

03:33.624 --> 03:35.058
Russell, that steak's
cooked perfectly.

03:35.126 --> 03:36.560
Thank you, Chef.
Keep it going, Russell, yes?

03:36.627 --> 03:37.994
<i>Keep it going.</i>

03:38.062 --> 03:39.696
(Announcer)
Our other finalist, Nona,

03:39.764 --> 03:41.431
survived some early trouble.

03:41.499 --> 03:44.034
Nona, I've had enough.

03:44.102 --> 03:46.470
It's undercooked!
It's such a shame!

03:46.537 --> 03:48.438
I am [Bleep] Dying.

03:48.506 --> 03:50.340
(Announcer)
But after some strong
dinner performances...

03:50.408 --> 03:52.242
Nona, very good,
that risotto.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.277
Good girl, bingo.
Gold star.

03:54.345 --> 03:56.380
(Announcer)
She outshined everyone
in the taste test.

03:56.447 --> 03:58.648
Scallops, squash, endive.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.617
Yeah!
Well done, Nona.

04:00.685 --> 04:02.185
<i>Amazing.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

04:02.253 --> 04:03.887
(Announcer)
And then in the difficult

04:03.955 --> 04:05.422
taste-it-now-make-it
challenge...

04:05.490 --> 04:06.957
Congratulations, Nona.
Well done.

04:07.024 --> 04:07.924
<i>Pancetta is right.</i>

04:07.992 --> 04:10.260
Yay!

04:10.328 --> 04:12.129
(Announcer)
She proved she has
one of the best palates

04:12.196 --> 04:13.797
in <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> history.

04:13.865 --> 04:15.766
You've got the most important
jewel in the crown.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.701
(Announcer)
Tonight our two finalists,

04:17.769 --> 04:19.435
Chicago sous Chef Russell...

04:19.504 --> 04:21.471
I have a fire burning
bigger than any [Bleep]

04:21.539 --> 04:23.507
California wildfire ever.

04:23.574 --> 04:25.575
(Announcer)
And Atlanta sous Chef Nona...

04:25.643 --> 04:27.878
I want the L.A. Market.
I'm doing it for my family.

04:27.945 --> 04:29.279
(Announcer)
Will face off.

04:29.347 --> 04:31.415
Who will become Head Chef

04:31.482 --> 04:33.150
at the multimillion-dollar
restaurant, L.A. Market

04:33.217 --> 04:35.285
in downtown Los Angeles?

04:35.353 --> 04:36.787
The salary,
$1/4 million.

04:36.854 --> 04:38.355
[Cheering]

04:38.423 --> 04:39.756

And become the spokesperson

04:39.824 --> 04:41.124
for Rosemount Winery.

04:41.192 --> 04:42.893
Holy moly!

04:42.960 --> 04:44.261
Yeah, baby!

04:44.328 --> 04:45.929
(Announcer)
One thing is for sure...

04:45.997 --> 04:47.898
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

season ever...

04:49.667 --> 04:51.001
Get a grip!

04:51.068 --> 04:52.602
(Announcer)

04:52.670 --> 04:54.104
Come on, Vinny!
You're killing us.

04:54.172 --> 04:55.739
Russell is a douche bag.

04:55.807 --> 04:57.607
This is my [Bleep] Day,
and I'm not going down.

04:57.675 --> 04:59.209
Boris, it's wrong.
<i>Move!</i>

04:59.277 --> 05:00.477
<i>Come on, man,</i>
<i>you took too much out.</i>

05:00.545 --> 05:01.678
Hey, argue later.

05:01.746 --> 05:03.213
Hey, hey.
Don't touch me.

05:03.281 --> 05:03.847
I will put your ass
through a wall.

05:03.915 --> 05:04.614
Don't touch me.

05:04.682 --> 05:06.183
That's the third piece!

05:06.250 --> 05:07.284
If you two don't
shut the [Bleep] Up,

05:07.351 --> 05:08.618
I swear to God.

05:08.686 --> 05:10.153

06:23.227 --> 06:24.628
Congratulations.

06:24.695 --> 06:26.429
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you so much.

06:26.497 --> 06:29.099
The next time the doors
to Hell's Kitchen open,

06:29.166 --> 06:33.169
the restaurant will be yours.

06:33.237 --> 06:37.040
I want you both to start
planning your menus tonight.

06:37.108 --> 06:38.909
Yes, Chef.
Thank you.

06:38.976 --> 06:40.644

07:02.033 --> 07:03.199
Wow.

07:03.267 --> 07:04.534
This menu is
the most important thing

07:04.602 --> 07:05.969
I will ever write.

07:06.037 --> 07:08.171
It's gonna be
something well-flavored

07:08.239 --> 07:09.673
with beautiful ingredients,

07:09.740 --> 07:11.207
southern through and through.

07:11.275 --> 07:12.509
(Announcer)
Russell and Nona

07:12.577 --> 07:14.144
spend most of the night
working on their menus.

07:16.247 --> 07:17.581
With only 32 hours

07:17.648 --> 07:19.616
until the doors
of Hell's Kitchen open,

07:19.684 --> 07:21.518
the two finalists
head downstairs

07:21.586 --> 07:22.953
to consult with their
sous Chefs.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.521
How are you?
Wonderful.

07:24.589 --> 07:27.090
Menu ideas are flowing?
Yes.
Heavy flow.

07:27.158 --> 07:28.191
My menu is elegant,

07:28.259 --> 07:29.759
it's contemporary,

07:29.827 --> 07:31.394
and it's simple.

07:31.462 --> 07:33.263
I wanted to kinda do, like,
a fusion kinda thing

07:33.331 --> 07:34.397
and do, you know,
goat cheese.

07:34.465 --> 07:35.465
(Announcer)
The Chefs spend the day

07:35.533 --> 07:36.533
going over
their food lists.

07:36.601 --> 07:37.834
It's a crumbly cheese,

07:37.902 --> 07:39.336
and it has
apricots in it.

07:39.403 --> 07:41.171
(Announcer)
Fine-tuning their presentation.

07:41.238 --> 07:43.073
Do the scallops here,
do the puree.

07:43.140 --> 07:43.974
A little drizzle of curry oil
on the plate.

07:44.041 --> 07:45.742
Sounds nice.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.577
(Announcer)
And perfecting
their cooking techniques.

07:47.645 --> 07:49.312
I'm not wanting it
to be, like, a mash.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.681
(Announcer)
Nona and Russell have finished
designing their menus.

07:51.749 --> 07:52.949
This all is starting
to come together.
Yeah.

07:53.017 --> 07:55.318
(Announcer)
And for now their work is done.

07:55.386 --> 07:57.187
<i>Russell, Nona, come here.</i>

07:57.254 --> 07:58.788
(Announcer)
Because there's
a pressing issue

07:58.856 --> 07:59.789
that they need
to attend to.

07:59.857 --> 08:01.124
Chef Ramsay
is waiting for you.

08:01.192 --> 08:02.325
<i>I need you to go upstairs</i>

08:02.393 --> 08:03.326
<i>and get changed immediately.</i>

08:03.394 --> 08:04.928
Yes, Chef.
Go.

08:04.996 --> 08:06.563
What the hell is going on?

08:06.631 --> 08:08.565
I have no idea
where I'm about to go.

08:12.136 --> 08:13.903
I hate the not knowing.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.805
Hell's Kitchen is notorious

08:15.873 --> 08:18.108
for throwing
the biggest curveballs.

08:18.175 --> 08:19.876
Where are we going?

08:19.944 --> 08:21.578
And I feel like we're
about to catch one right now.

08:24.281 --> 08:25.715
<i>Russell.</i>
Hey, Chef.

08:25.783 --> 08:27.083
Nona, look at you guys.
How are you both?

08:27.151 --> 08:28.718
Great, Chef.
Great.

08:28.786 --> 08:31.955
Now for one of you, Los Angeles
will be your new home.

08:32.023 --> 08:34.557
So I can't think of a much
better way to see it

08:34.625 --> 08:37.227
than from that thing there.

08:37.294 --> 08:39.062
Ahh!
Awesome.

08:39.130 --> 08:40.897
Ready? Let's go.
Yes, Chef.

08:40.965 --> 08:42.599
I've never been
in a helicopter.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.135
How freakin' amazing.
Ladies first.

08:46.737 --> 08:47.437
<i>(Pilot)</i>
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

08:54.245 --> 08:55.345
L.A. from the air
is gorgeous.

08:55.413 --> 08:56.413
Wow.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.447
Santa Monica Pier.

08:57.515 --> 08:58.615
The Kodak Theatre.

08:58.683 --> 09:00.283
Hollywood Boulevard.

09:00.351 --> 09:03.687
It's truly breathtaking.

09:03.754 --> 09:05.488
Oh, my God.

09:05.556 --> 09:07.657
I will do whatever it takes
to win this,

09:07.725 --> 09:09.759
because I have to work here.

09:16.567 --> 09:17.801
[Cheering]

09:22.106 --> 09:23.406
What did you say?

09:23.474 --> 09:24.741
Challenge?

09:24.809 --> 09:26.109
I thought we were
just hanging out.

09:29.947 --> 09:32.182
Oh, my God!

09:32.249 --> 09:33.917
Let's do this.

09:33.984 --> 09:36.186
I want to get down there and
see what this is all about.

09:38.022 --> 09:39.255
James is waiting there,

09:39.323 --> 09:41.024
and he's got parachutes.

09:41.092 --> 09:42.525
What the [Bleep]
Is this about?

09:42.593 --> 09:44.327
Listen, it's not
that far down.

09:44.395 --> 09:46.496
<i>But more importantly,</i>

09:46.564 --> 09:48.264
they open automatic.

09:48.332 --> 09:49.999
I'm gonna open automatically.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.569
You want me to jump
off a roof? No, no.

09:52.636 --> 09:54.237
I'm gonna [Bleep] My pants.

09:54.305 --> 09:55.505
Oh, my God.
[Bleep].

09:55.573 --> 09:56.873
Let's go.

09:56.941 --> 09:58.675
[Bleep] You.

09:58.743 --> 10:00.176
I'm ready to go.

10:00.244 --> 10:01.778
I will free fall right now.
Let's do it.

10:01.846 --> 10:03.113
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Nona, come here.</i>

10:03.180 --> 10:04.447
I'm joking.
Come on.

10:04.515 --> 10:05.749
Man!

10:05.816 --> 10:07.917
Oh, my God,
I was so ready.

10:07.985 --> 10:09.119
Give me some toilet paper.

10:12.656 --> 10:14.224
All right,
let's go, guys.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.092
Great. You just made me [Bleep]
My pants.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.827
But we're heading downstairs
to do the final challenge.

10:17.895 --> 10:20.029
Let's go.
I'm ready for anything.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.499
[Cheers and applause]

10:27.404 --> 10:28.705
(Nona)
There's all these people
jumping up and down

10:28.773 --> 10:29.606
and screaming.

10:29.673 --> 10:31.307
I'm like a rock star.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.343
I was, like, about to bust out
in some Motley Crue.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.845
Are you ready to rock?
Whoo!

10:35.913 --> 10:38.414
Ladies and gentlemen,
our <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> finalists,

10:38.482 --> 10:39.582
Nona and Russell.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.785
[Cheers and applause]

10:43.687 --> 10:44.821
Now today for your challenge,

10:44.889 --> 10:46.156
each of you will create

10:46.223 --> 10:47.157
five stunning dishes.

10:47.224 --> 10:48.792
One hour to cook

10:48.859 --> 10:50.260
<i>all your dishes,</i>

10:50.327 --> 10:51.761
and you'll be judged

10:51.829 --> 10:54.063
by the most highly distinguished
individuals

10:54.131 --> 10:57.333
<i>of the Los Angeles</i>
<i>culinary community.</i>

10:57.401 --> 10:58.968
It's absolutely do or die.

10:59.036 --> 11:00.570
There's no rehearsal for this.
This is it.

11:00.638 --> 11:01.638
Are you ready?
Yes, Chef.

11:01.705 --> 11:02.839
Off you go.

11:02.907 --> 11:04.607
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i> <i>Let's go.</i>

11:04.675 --> 11:06.209
(Announcer)
The finalists will be cooking

11:06.277 --> 11:07.977
in what could be
their restaurant,

11:08.045 --> 11:10.346
located in the lobby
of this new downtown skyscraper.

11:10.414 --> 11:12.882
They will have less than an hour
to prepare five dishes

11:12.950 --> 11:17.554
consisting of a soup, salad,
pasta, fish, and meat entree.

11:17.621 --> 11:18.755
Hot stuff.

11:18.823 --> 11:20.390
This is my last challenge.

11:20.457 --> 11:21.991
Ow.
In the eye.

11:22.059 --> 11:23.960
I'm making a southern menu.

11:24.028 --> 11:25.428
Pan is steaming.

11:25.496 --> 11:26.996
But I'm gonna tweak it up
a little bit

11:27.064 --> 11:28.298
and make it real fine dining.

11:28.365 --> 11:30.733
Oh, yeah.
Cheese.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.702
[Cheers and applause]

11:32.770 --> 11:35.238
(All)
Russell! Russell!

11:35.306 --> 11:36.673
Half an hour left, yes?
(Both) Yes, Chef.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.107
Trying to cook something

11:38.175 --> 11:39.909
without cream,
without a lot of butter.

11:39.977 --> 11:42.412
Just something that people
from California appreciate.

11:42.479 --> 11:44.047
My destiny is in my hands.

11:44.114 --> 11:45.615
This is me against Nona.
Behind. Hot.

11:45.683 --> 11:47.116
(All)
Russell! Russell!

11:47.184 --> 11:48.484
(All)
Nona!

11:48.552 --> 11:50.086
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Five. Four.</i>

11:50.154 --> 11:52.655
<i>Three. Two. One.</i>

11:52.723 --> 11:54.457
Time's up.
Done.

11:56.327 --> 11:58.027
(Announcer)
With the cooking complete,

11:58.095 --> 11:59.696
it's now time
for Nona and Russell

11:59.763 --> 12:01.564
to go head-to-head
in their final challenge.

12:01.632 --> 12:03.466
Time to meet
our first judge.

12:03.534 --> 12:07.770
He is the President
and the CEO of AEG,

12:07.838 --> 12:10.540
the company behind
the revitalization

12:10.608 --> 12:13.843
of downtown Los Angeles,
as well as L.A. Live,

12:13.911 --> 12:17.247
home to the restaurant,
the L.A. Market.

12:17.314 --> 12:19.349
Please welcome Tim Leiweke.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.784
Absolutely amazing.
Thank you so much.

12:21.852 --> 12:24.420
Right. You'll be judging
our first round--the soup.

12:24.488 --> 12:27.023
Nona, explain
what your soup is, please.

12:27.091 --> 12:29.626
This is a loaded potato soup

12:29.693 --> 12:32.262
garnished with bacon,
cheddar, and chives.

12:32.329 --> 12:34.163
That's very good.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.331
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Oh, nice.</i>

12:35.399 --> 12:37.867
Oh, my God.
Yay!

12:37.935 --> 12:39.802
[Applause]
Russell.

12:39.870 --> 12:41.137
I have roasted cauliflower soup.

12:41.205 --> 12:42.605
<i>No cream.</i>

12:42.673 --> 12:44.407
<i>Trying to keep it light,</i>
<i>California.</i>

12:44.475 --> 12:45.475
<i>A little crab salad,</i>
<i>a little curry oil</i>

12:45.542 --> 12:46.976
to top it off,
keep it simple.

12:47.044 --> 12:48.811
Two very fascinating,
interesting-looking soups.

12:48.879 --> 12:50.613
Very different tastes,
both of them.

12:50.681 --> 12:51.714
Is it Nona's

12:51.782 --> 12:53.917
<i>or is it Russell's?</i>

12:53.984 --> 12:55.351
I love 'em both,

12:55.419 --> 12:56.552
<i>but if you had</i>
<i>to twist my arm...</i>

12:58.489 --> 13:01.291
I have to say Nona's
was my...

13:01.358 --> 13:03.192
[Cheers and applause]

13:03.260 --> 13:04.928
Yes!
Yes, I've got a point!

13:04.995 --> 13:06.462
Wonderful.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.631
I'm liking the way
this is starting off.

13:08.699 --> 13:10.233
(Gordon)
The next dish

13:10.301 --> 13:11.901
is the salad round.

13:11.969 --> 13:13.269
Now this man
is the holder

13:13.337 --> 13:14.938
of six fantastic restaurants.

13:15.005 --> 13:17.273
<i>Please welcome</i>
<i>Michelin-star Chef</i>

13:17.341 --> 13:18.608
Joachim Splichal.

13:18.676 --> 13:20.843
Joachim!
Really good to see you.

13:20.911 --> 13:22.412
And welcome, welcome.
Thank you so much.

13:22.479 --> 13:23.846
[Applause]

13:23.914 --> 13:27.684
This is a beet salad
with frisee, arugula,

13:27.751 --> 13:29.552
<i>and watercress</i>

13:29.620 --> 13:31.788
with a grapefruit champagne
vinaigrette.

13:31.855 --> 13:33.890
Tastes great.
Thank you, Chef.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.425
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Excellent.</i>

13:35.492 --> 13:38.027
Now, Russell, please,
the Chef will explain.

13:38.095 --> 13:39.762
I have a burrata
and prosciutto salad

13:39.830 --> 13:40.997
<i>on a little bit</i>
<i>of arugula</i>

13:41.065 --> 13:43.232
<i>all dressed</i>
<i>in white balsamic.</i>

13:43.300 --> 13:45.034
It's really
a fantastic salad.

13:45.102 --> 13:47.036
I don't know
who should win here.

13:47.104 --> 13:48.738
Which one of these dishes

13:48.806 --> 13:50.173
will be best suited

13:50.240 --> 13:51.841
to the brand-new
L.A. Market restaurant?

13:51.909 --> 13:53.476
It will be...

13:55.145 --> 13:57.080
Russell.
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Russell.</i>

13:57.147 --> 13:58.715
Ladies and gentlemen,
one-one.

13:58.782 --> 13:59.849
Yes.
Thank you.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.117
One-one.
I got this.

14:01.185 --> 14:02.418
Right.
The next dish.

14:02.486 --> 14:04.687
Pasta.
It will be judged

14:04.755 --> 14:07.156
by a Michelin-star Chef,
David Myers.

14:07.224 --> 14:08.391
Excellent.

14:08.459 --> 14:10.994
[Cheers and applause]

14:11.061 --> 14:13.029
(Announcer)
The score's all tied up,

14:13.097 --> 14:14.697
and now Chef Myers
will decide

14:14.765 --> 14:15.565
between Nona's pan-seared
chicken breast

14:15.632 --> 14:16.899
over orecchiette...

14:16.967 --> 14:19.669
I would eat this all day long
in the summer.

14:19.737 --> 14:22.071
(Announcer)
And Russell's garganelli
with sea scallops.

14:22.139 --> 14:23.740
I love the way
he paired the orange

14:23.807 --> 14:25.241
with the scallops
and the mint.

14:25.309 --> 14:28.044
It's really tough.

14:28.112 --> 14:29.846
Chef, I'm gonna go
with Nona's.

14:29.913 --> 14:32.515
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Nona's. Whoo-hoo.</i>

14:32.583 --> 14:34.150
Nice!
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Excellent.</i>

14:34.218 --> 14:36.019
This entree
will be judged

14:36.086 --> 14:38.354
by the Executive Chef
of the Water Grill Restaurant,

14:38.422 --> 14:39.889
Chef David Lefevre.

14:39.957 --> 14:41.758
[Applause]

14:41.825 --> 14:43.259
Wow.
It's like going

14:43.327 --> 14:45.228
from one superstar
to the next.

14:45.295 --> 14:46.662
It's like cooking for Kobe
and then cooking for LeBron

14:46.730 --> 14:47.930
and then cooking
for Carmelo.

14:47.998 --> 14:50.166
So I need to impress
these heavy-hitters.

14:50.234 --> 14:51.834
(Announcer)
With Russell down by one,

14:51.902 --> 14:53.603
he must win the fish round,

14:53.670 --> 14:55.304
or Nona will clinch
the victory.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.739
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

14:56.807 --> 14:58.374
(Announcer)
Chef Lefevre starts

14:58.442 --> 14:59.642
with Russell's pan-seared
arctic char.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.677
You're serving the skin,
which I love.

15:01.745 --> 15:03.413
(Announcer)
Followed by Nona's
pan-seared salmon

15:03.480 --> 15:04.947
with sauteed vegetables.

15:05.015 --> 15:06.282
Overall,
I think it's a good dish.

15:06.350 --> 15:07.517
Very good job,
both of you.

15:07.584 --> 15:09.519
[Cheers and applause]

15:09.586 --> 15:11.554
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Is it Nona's</i>
<i>or is it Russell's?</i>

15:11.622 --> 15:12.922
[Shouting]

15:12.990 --> 15:14.424
I have to choose
this one.

15:14.491 --> 15:16.192
Congratulations,
Russell.

15:18.028 --> 15:19.362
(All)
Russell! Russell!

15:19.430 --> 15:20.897
We're all tied up.
Two-two.

15:20.964 --> 15:22.365
<i>It all comes down</i>

15:22.433 --> 15:24.867
to the final dish,
the meat entree.

15:24.935 --> 15:27.737
This dish will be judged
by someone

15:27.805 --> 15:30.073
that our finalists
will really want to impress.

15:30.140 --> 15:33.142
He is the future employer of
the winner of <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

15:34.545 --> 15:35.545
Kerry Simon!

15:35.612 --> 15:37.213
[Cheers and applause]

15:37.281 --> 15:39.115
Good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming.

15:39.183 --> 15:40.950
Here we go.

15:41.018 --> 15:42.018
<i>Nona.</i>

15:42.086 --> 15:44.253
We have a pan-seared rib eye

15:44.321 --> 15:45.421
<i>with a cauliflower puree</i>

15:45.489 --> 15:47.623
<i>with wild mushrooms.</i>

15:47.691 --> 15:50.026
I love purees and stuff
working with meat.

15:50.094 --> 15:51.661
I think it works well,
and the mushrooms and all that.

15:51.728 --> 15:52.762
[Cheers and applause]

15:52.830 --> 15:53.930
Russell.

15:53.997 --> 15:56.332
I did a grilled veal tender

15:56.400 --> 15:58.067
with roasted red pepper,
a little bit of pearl onions.

15:58.135 --> 15:59.268
I like the presentation.

15:59.336 --> 16:00.470
Got the swirling going on

16:00.537 --> 16:01.504
<i>and the sauces around.</i>

16:01.572 --> 16:03.539
Tough decision.

16:03.607 --> 16:05.174
<i>(Kerry)</i>
<i>It's very hard.</i>

16:05.242 --> 16:07.143
Your decision--
is it going to be Russell's

16:07.211 --> 16:08.511
<i>or Nona's?</i>

16:08.579 --> 16:10.746
Oh, crap.

16:10.814 --> 16:12.381
I have to win this point.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.350
I need this now.

16:14.418 --> 16:15.718
Please, lord.

16:15.786 --> 16:17.820
Which one?

16:17.888 --> 16:19.522
I...

16:19.590 --> 16:20.523
I think I'm gonna have
to go with--

16:25.681 --> 16:26.847
(announcer)
The <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> finalists

16:26.915 --> 16:27.982
are all tied up

16:28.050 --> 16:30.184
in their last challenge.
Your decision--

16:30.252 --> 16:32.520
is it gonna be Russell's
or Nona's?

16:32.588 --> 16:34.088
(Announcer)
It's now up to their
future employer Kerry Simon

16:34.156 --> 16:35.156
to decide the winner.

16:35.224 --> 16:36.657
Which one?

16:36.725 --> 16:38.759
[Shouting]

16:38.827 --> 16:40.328
It's tied two-two.

16:40.395 --> 16:41.996
In my head, I'm like,
"[Bleep] Me.

16:42.064 --> 16:43.297
Are you kidding?"

16:44.633 --> 16:46.467
Come on.
I have to win.

16:46.535 --> 16:48.669
Say it!
Just say it.

16:50.973 --> 16:52.240
I think I'm gonna have
to go with the veal.

16:52.307 --> 16:53.474
Russell!
Yes!

16:53.542 --> 16:54.809
[Cheers and applause]

16:54.876 --> 16:55.910
Congratulations
to Russell!

16:55.978 --> 16:57.645
Good job.
Well done.

16:57.713 --> 16:59.280
I'm feeling great.

16:59.348 --> 17:00.548
I'm always thrilled to win,
but I've still got

17:00.616 --> 17:01.916
one step left to take.

17:01.984 --> 17:03.184
And I think tomorrow,
if I give my best effort

17:03.252 --> 17:04.952
and I show Chef
that I am a leader,

17:05.020 --> 17:06.220
I think the prize is there
waiting for me.

17:06.288 --> 17:07.355
Congratulations to Nona.

17:07.422 --> 17:08.955
[Cheers and applause]

17:09.023 --> 17:11.559
You may have won this battle,
Russ,

17:11.627 --> 17:13.060
but I will not lay down
for the next one.

17:13.127 --> 17:15.496
Gonna be a big, big fight.

17:15.564 --> 17:16.998
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Okay, right,</i>

17:17.065 --> 17:18.165
<i>Russell and Nona,</i>
<i>well done.</i>

17:18.233 --> 17:19.733
I have one more little surprise
for you

17:19.800 --> 17:21.669
back at Hell's Kitchen.
Let's go.

17:21.737 --> 17:23.003
Ladies and gentlemen,
Russell and Nona, please.

17:23.070 --> 17:24.472
[Cheers and applause]

17:24.539 --> 17:26.339
Good night.
Thank you.

17:26.407 --> 17:28.609
(Announcer)
It's the end
of the final challenge,

17:28.677 --> 17:30.811
and Russell and Nona
return to Hell's Kitchen

17:30.879 --> 17:34.815
feeling a little anxious about
Chef Ramsay's next surprise.

17:34.883 --> 17:38.252
We walk upstairs.
All the lights are off.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.221
And so we start to, like,
tiptoe, like,

17:40.289 --> 17:42.223
what the hell is going on?

17:42.291 --> 17:45.293
There really is no--no telling
what Chef has in store for us.

17:47.329 --> 17:48.996
All: Surprise!

17:49.064 --> 17:54.435
[Laughter]

17:55.804 --> 17:57.271
Oh, my God.

17:57.339 --> 17:59.573
I'm immediately thinking
about who I want

17:59.641 --> 18:00.841
as my brigade.

18:00.909 --> 18:02.977
Yes. Yes.
No.

18:03.045 --> 18:05.513
No. No.
Hell, no.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.048
I don't know
who's on my team yet,

18:07.115 --> 18:08.683
but I know
who can't cook.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.419
[Phone ringing]

18:11.486 --> 18:13.054
Hello?

18:13.121 --> 18:14.755
Trev.

18:14.823 --> 18:15.956
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Chef.</i>

18:16.024 --> 18:17.692
Come on down.
All right, sure.

18:17.759 --> 18:19.794
Thank you.

18:19.861 --> 18:21.062
Oof.
They're back.

18:21.129 --> 18:22.196
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

18:22.264 --> 18:23.164
<i>Quick, quick like a bunny.</i>

18:27.636 --> 18:29.770
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Great smiles</i>
<i>on your faces there.</i>

18:29.838 --> 18:31.672
Excellent.
Right.

18:31.740 --> 18:35.576
So you're all back for one final
critical dinner service.

18:35.644 --> 18:37.078
<i>The big difference is,</i>
<i>this time,</i>

18:37.145 --> 18:38.913
it's not me
relying on you.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.114
<i>It's Russell</i>
<i>and Nona.</i>

18:40.182 --> 18:42.149
<i>They are relying on you</i>

18:42.217 --> 18:43.584
like you've never, ever
experienced before.

18:43.652 --> 18:45.720
<i>Yes?</i>

18:45.787 --> 18:47.788
<i>Now, Russell,</i>
<i>for winning the challenge,</i>

18:47.856 --> 18:50.424
you get to pick first.

18:51.727 --> 18:53.961
Think carefully
and pick

18:54.029 --> 18:55.730
<i>your strongest option.</i>

18:55.797 --> 18:57.331
Boom, done.
Jillian.

18:57.399 --> 18:59.100
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Jillian, congratulations.</i>

18:59.167 --> 19:00.935
I knew Russell
was gonna pick me first

19:01.002 --> 19:03.337
because I kick ass
in the kitchen.

19:03.405 --> 19:05.005
If I was Russell,
I would pick me too.

19:05.073 --> 19:06.374
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Good choice.</i>

19:06.441 --> 19:07.742
Right, Nona,
your choice.

19:07.809 --> 19:08.776
<i>Off you go.</i>

19:11.213 --> 19:13.481
Gail.

19:13.548 --> 19:15.149
I'm so happy
I'm on Nona's team.

19:15.217 --> 19:16.617
She knows I can cook
my heart out.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.219
We're gonna rock this out,

19:18.286 --> 19:20.054
and we gonna kick
some Russell ass.

19:20.122 --> 19:22.656
Russell. Second selection
for the brigade.

19:22.724 --> 19:25.326
I wanted to pick Vinny,

19:25.394 --> 19:28.095
but Vinny seems a little tired,
like out of it, glazed over.

19:28.163 --> 19:30.064
How are you feeling?
'Cause you look tired.

19:30.132 --> 19:31.699
I want to know.
Are you confident?

19:31.767 --> 19:33.567
I feel like a million bucks.

19:33.635 --> 19:36.604
Russell got me out far earlier
than I should have.

19:36.671 --> 19:39.306
Russell, who did you vote for?

19:39.374 --> 19:40.841
Vinny. He didn't pull
his weight tonight,

19:40.909 --> 19:42.376
and he buried us.

19:42.444 --> 19:45.746
If he picks me,
it's gonna turn my stomach.

19:45.814 --> 19:46.781
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Vinny.</i>

19:46.848 --> 19:49.417
Get your ass over here.

19:49.484 --> 19:50.885
Move faster
so I got some confidence.

19:50.952 --> 19:52.987
Fast as I go.

19:53.054 --> 19:54.755
This sucks.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.791
Now I'm gonna have to help
that piece of [Bleep] Win.

19:56.858 --> 19:59.427
Okay, Nona.

19:59.494 --> 20:01.162
Melissa.

20:01.229 --> 20:03.164
Melissa.
Good choice.

20:03.231 --> 20:04.532
Russell.
Next choice.

20:04.599 --> 20:06.100
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Um...</i>

20:06.168 --> 20:07.701
Sabrina.
Really?

20:07.769 --> 20:10.004
[Laughter]

20:10.071 --> 20:12.006
I'm gonna go
with my gut, girl.

20:12.073 --> 20:13.507
I do have faith
in Sabrina.

20:13.575 --> 20:14.542
She hasn't had
a lot of bad services,

20:14.609 --> 20:15.643
just a lot of attitude.

20:15.710 --> 20:16.777
I didn't get picked last!

20:16.845 --> 20:17.912
I can't believe it.

20:17.979 --> 20:19.313
Finally,

20:19.381 --> 20:21.282
somebody got some brains
up in this bitch.

20:21.349 --> 20:22.850
Next choice, Nona.

20:22.918 --> 20:24.151
<i>Who is it?</i>
Trev.

20:24.219 --> 20:25.619
<i>Trev.</i>
<i>Good choice.</i>

20:25.687 --> 20:27.021
I want to help Nona win.

20:27.088 --> 20:28.489
I'm glad
I'm gonna get a chance

20:28.557 --> 20:29.990
to knock Mr. cocky
to the floor.

20:30.058 --> 20:31.392
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Russell.</i>

20:31.460 --> 20:34.361
I cannot tell you
how important this moment is.

20:34.429 --> 20:35.663
<i>You're choosing</i>
<i>for both of you now.</i>

20:35.730 --> 20:38.799
<i>Think carefully.</i>

20:38.867 --> 20:40.634
Russell,
your choice.

20:40.702 --> 20:42.169
<i>Off you go.</i>

20:44.272 --> 20:45.406
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Rob.</i>

20:45.474 --> 20:47.007
Well done.

20:47.075 --> 20:48.576
<i>Boris to Nona.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:51.446 --> 20:52.847
Nona,
how do you feel?

20:52.914 --> 20:54.281
I've got a workhorse
of a team here.

20:54.349 --> 20:55.850
I'm really excited
about 'em.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.084
Good.
How do you feel, Russell?

20:57.152 --> 20:58.886
I feel great.

20:58.954 --> 21:00.788
Good.
Tomorrow, it's make or break.

21:00.856 --> 21:02.122
Good to see you all.

21:02.190 --> 21:03.491
Good night.
Good night, Chef.

21:05.861 --> 21:07.561
I am confident in my team.

21:07.629 --> 21:08.963
I know
that they are loyal.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.731
I know they want me
to win.

21:10.799 --> 21:12.500
I think that this is definitely
the team

21:12.567 --> 21:13.968
that's gonna take me
to victory.

21:14.035 --> 21:15.202
Nona picked a bunch
of weaklings.

21:15.270 --> 21:16.704
I am not worried
about my competition.

21:16.771 --> 21:18.272
And I'm not gonna even look over
at their kitchen.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.874
(Announcer)
While the finalists

21:19.941 --> 21:21.208
and their teams
tuck themselves in

21:21.276 --> 21:23.143
for one last night
in Hell's Kitchen...

21:23.211 --> 21:24.645
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

21:24.713 --> 21:25.579
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay's team

21:25.647 --> 21:26.881
works through the night

21:26.948 --> 21:29.683
transforming
the dining room.

21:31.786 --> 21:33.287
As dawn breaks,
Russell and Nona

21:33.355 --> 21:34.922
get to work prepping

21:34.990 --> 21:36.657
for the most important
dinner service of their lives.

21:36.725 --> 21:38.259
(Nona)
I'll put the prep list up here.

21:38.326 --> 21:39.727
<i>We all pumped?</i>
Yep.

21:39.794 --> 21:41.862
Guys, let's get started.
Let's get pans.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.197
Let's go.
Come on, guys.

21:47.502 --> 21:48.736
Nona, what size do you want?
Julienne.

21:48.803 --> 21:50.671
Today is the day.

21:50.739 --> 21:52.339
Everything has to be perfect.

21:52.407 --> 21:55.743
I planned my menu
in a simple way

21:55.810 --> 21:57.177
that is definitely not hard
to execute.

21:57.245 --> 21:59.013
Are these on?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.282
Boris is my biggest concern
right now.

22:01.349 --> 22:02.516
He's just slow.

22:02.584 --> 22:03.417
It's on.
It is on?

22:03.485 --> 22:04.418
Yup.

22:04.486 --> 22:05.486
Like, mentally.

22:05.554 --> 22:06.720
All right, come here.

22:06.788 --> 22:08.355
We're gonna do this together.

22:08.423 --> 22:10.324
I'm definitely gonna have
to talk with him,

22:10.392 --> 22:12.493
but it's like talking
to a child.

22:12.561 --> 22:14.028
You want to use
an adult-sized spoon.

22:14.095 --> 22:15.696
<i>Five minutes in the oven.</i>

22:15.764 --> 22:17.364
[Sighs]

22:17.432 --> 22:19.300
I'm going to vomit.

22:19.367 --> 22:21.969
(Announcer)
While Boris seems to be moving
in slow motion,

22:22.037 --> 22:24.805
over in the blue kitchen,
all the Chefs

22:24.873 --> 22:26.540
seem focused
on the task at hand.

22:26.608 --> 22:28.208
I'm excited
to do this [Bleep], dude.

22:28.276 --> 22:29.977
You want me to get you
some eggs?

22:30.045 --> 22:30.978
Yeah, I need some egg wash.

22:31.046 --> 22:32.112
Awesome.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.647
Great job, Jillian.
Mm-hmm.

22:33.715 --> 22:35.316
Vinny,
watch those tomatoes, buddy.

22:35.383 --> 22:36.750
Tomatoes.

22:36.818 --> 22:38.852
It's the biggest night
of my life.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.688
A lot of pressure
is on me,

22:40.755 --> 22:42.323
and I'm over-the-top motivated.

22:42.390 --> 22:43.857
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>I got to be honest.</i>

22:43.925 --> 22:45.693
Everybody else
has shown passion today.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.428
I want you
to [Bleep] Fire up.

22:47.495 --> 22:48.862
I'm serious.
I need some excitement, bro.

22:51.232 --> 22:53.000
(Russell)
I'm worried about Vinny.

22:53.068 --> 22:53.734
He's jealous
that I made it to the finals.

22:53.802 --> 22:55.169
I don't care.

22:55.236 --> 22:57.371
It's not about anybody else.
It's about me.

22:57.439 --> 23:00.507
If somebody can't get the job
done, it's gonna get ugly.

23:00.575 --> 23:02.376
That was dirty
the way you did me.

23:02.444 --> 23:03.510
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Russell, who should not make it</i>

23:03.578 --> 23:04.878
to the final six?

23:04.946 --> 23:06.580
I voted for Vinny.

23:06.648 --> 23:08.382
That was dirty.

23:08.450 --> 23:09.817
Vinny, get over it.

23:09.884 --> 23:11.552
Gotta stop worrying
about the past.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.519
I'm not playing games
no more, bro.

23:12.587 --> 23:13.954
I'm not even kidding.

23:14.022 --> 23:14.788
I will put your ass
through a wall.

23:14.856 --> 23:16.323
<i>Vinny,</i>

23:16.391 --> 23:18.192
if you want to be
on the other team,

23:18.259 --> 23:19.660
by all means,
get the [Bleep] Out of here.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.223
(Announcer)
The final dinner service

23:29.291 --> 23:30.491
in Hell's Kitchen
is fast approaching.

23:30.559 --> 23:32.193
But Russell...

23:32.260 --> 23:33.861
Vinny, if you want
to be on the other team,

23:33.929 --> 23:35.563
get the [Bleep]
Out of here.

23:35.630 --> 23:36.931
(Announcer)
Is about to be down
one team member

23:36.998 --> 23:38.766
before the night even starts.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.868
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Vinny, wait!</i>

23:40.936 --> 23:42.169
<i>Vinny, come back.</i>

23:42.237 --> 23:43.604
<i>I know you're pissed.</i>

23:43.672 --> 23:45.005
I want you
to [Bleep] Fire up,

23:45.073 --> 23:46.173
because I've seen it before.

23:46.241 --> 23:47.441
I know you got it.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.709
You don't got
to worry about me.

23:48.777 --> 23:49.910
I can't stand the [Bleep] Guy.

23:49.978 --> 23:51.445
I really can't.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.514
I just can't wait
for this day to be over.

23:53.582 --> 23:55.015
I'm not worried
about anything.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.751
All right.
Do your thing.

23:56.818 --> 23:58.552
(Announcer)
With their final dinner service

23:58.620 --> 23:59.687
less than an hour away,
Russell...

23:59.755 --> 24:01.756
Are my panna cottas almost done?

24:01.823 --> 24:09.563
(Announcer)
And Nona...

24:09.631 --> 24:11.866
Can start,

24:11.933 --> 24:13.067
there's still one detail
that must be addressed.

24:13.135 --> 24:15.169
This is your service,
your night.

24:15.237 --> 24:16.904
Yes, Chef.

24:16.972 --> 24:18.973
I need you both
to look the part.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.608
Nona, that's for you.
Haha.

24:20.675 --> 24:23.444
Thank you.
Mwah.

24:23.512 --> 24:25.246
Hey, big man.
That's for you.

24:25.313 --> 24:26.580
Now head upstairs,

24:26.648 --> 24:27.581
get changed,

24:27.649 --> 24:28.916
and come down

24:28.984 --> 24:30.484
as the Chef
of your kitchens

24:30.552 --> 24:33.120
and really inject
the creativity

24:33.188 --> 24:35.122
and the passion
into your team.

24:35.190 --> 24:36.524
Off you go.
(Both) Yes, Chef.

24:36.591 --> 24:37.691
30 minutes, guys.

24:37.759 --> 24:39.260
Are we good?
Got it.

24:39.327 --> 24:41.462
I want everything up.
I'll be right down, okay?

24:41.530 --> 24:43.097
It's time to take
the next step.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.298
It's not 16 anymore.
It's not 8.

24:44.366 --> 24:45.566
It's not 4. It's not 3.
It's 2.

24:45.634 --> 24:46.667
And I'm ready to go.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.768
It feels great

24:47.836 --> 24:49.103
to wear the head Chef jacket.

24:49.171 --> 24:50.538
100% pumped.

24:50.605 --> 24:52.173
I-I can't wait
to get started.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.175
I mean, it is for real.
It's go time.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.576
Right, James,

24:55.644 --> 24:56.677
open Hell's Kitchen, please.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.912
Yes, Chef.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.121
(Announcer)
There is clearly excitement

25:07.189 --> 25:08.189
in the air
as tonight's dinner service

25:08.256 --> 25:10.124
will launch the career
of one

25:10.192 --> 25:11.992
of our two finalists.

25:12.060 --> 25:13.794
It's Nona's contemporary
southern cuisine

25:13.862 --> 25:15.329
featuring
roasted baby beet salad,

25:15.397 --> 25:17.665
halibut with red pepper coulis,

25:17.732 --> 25:19.500
and rib eye
with a red wine reduction...

25:19.568 --> 25:21.569
- I'll have
the beet salad.

25:21.636 --> 25:23.270
(Announcer)
Against Russell's
European-inspired menu,

25:23.338 --> 25:25.739
which includes scallops
over cauliflower puree,

25:25.807 --> 25:27.208
goat cheese ravioli,

25:27.275 --> 25:29.310
and pan-seared filet mignon.

25:29.377 --> 25:30.911
It's a battle of top dog...

25:30.979 --> 25:32.646
We're gonna move.
We're gonna use urgency.

25:32.714 --> 25:34.248
(Announcer)
Versus mother hen.

25:34.316 --> 25:35.349
I have complete faith
in y'all.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.884
All right, Nona.
Do it.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.586
First ticket.
Four top to the blue.

25:38.653 --> 25:39.687
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Blue. Let's go.</i>

25:39.754 --> 25:40.754
Fire two scallops,
one burrata.

25:40.822 --> 25:41.922
(All)
Yes, Chef.

25:41.990 --> 25:43.490
Four top to the red.
Thank you, James.

25:43.558 --> 25:45.359
Fire appetizers,
four top.

25:45.427 --> 25:46.927
<i>One ravioli,</i>
<i>one carpaccio,</i>

25:46.995 --> 25:48.095
two beet salad.

25:48.163 --> 25:48.996
(All)
Yes, Chef.

25:49.064 --> 25:50.631
Come on, Vinny.

25:50.699 --> 25:52.366
I need you to come to the window
with those scallops.

25:52.434 --> 25:53.434
<i>Let's go.</i>
Yes.

25:53.501 --> 25:54.368
Don't tell me yes.
Get it moving.

25:54.436 --> 25:56.303
Russell is a douche bag.

25:56.371 --> 25:57.538
Give me that scallop.
Let's go.

25:57.606 --> 25:59.707
But I'm a professional,

25:59.774 --> 26:01.442
and I'm not gonna screw him
in any way.

26:01.509 --> 26:02.176
I'll do what needs
to be done.

26:02.244 --> 26:03.711
Come on, Vinny.

26:03.778 --> 26:05.045
Take those. I'll be up
with the others.

26:05.113 --> 26:06.313
<i>Vinny.</i>

26:06.381 --> 26:07.681
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>I don't think so, man.</i>

26:09.084 --> 26:10.885
Dude, it's not even hot.

26:10.952 --> 26:12.920
Yes, it is. I just took it out
of the [Bleep] Convection oven.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.154
Why are you arguing,
Vinny?

26:14.222 --> 26:15.389
[Bleep] Talk to me like that,

26:15.457 --> 26:17.725
you're [Bleep] History.
Come on, Vinny.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.627
Vinny didn't even make it
to black jackets,

26:19.694 --> 26:20.995
so he's got a lot
to prove tonight.

26:21.062 --> 26:21.662
Come on, Vinny.
Give me that scallop.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.430
Make it happen.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.798
I'm gonna be up on his ass
the whole night.

26:24.866 --> 26:26.300
And he knows that.

26:26.368 --> 26:27.735
What are you doing, bro?
I need this now.

26:27.802 --> 26:28.802
<i>Come on.</i>
You got it right now.

26:28.870 --> 26:30.938
Scallops in the window,
Chef.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.173
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Vinny, those scallops</i>
<i>are perfect.</i>

26:33.241 --> 26:34.375
Yes.
(Announcer)
Despite Vinny's false start

26:34.442 --> 26:35.943
on his scallops,

26:36.011 --> 26:37.778
appetizers are now leaving
the blue kitchen.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.213
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

26:39.281 --> 26:41.815
Trev.
Two beet salad.

26:41.883 --> 26:44.318
(Announcer)
Trev is hoping to get appetizers
rolling for Nona.

26:44.386 --> 26:46.820
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Salads up.</i>

26:46.888 --> 26:48.555
Trev, let's talk about this
real quick.

26:48.623 --> 26:49.924
<i>It's way overdressed.</i>

26:49.991 --> 26:51.692
Lightly toss it.
Lightly toss it.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.027
Real, real quick.

26:53.094 --> 26:54.395
I want to keep my team
motivated,

26:54.462 --> 26:56.297
so I have got
to remain calm,

26:56.364 --> 26:58.832
cool, and collected.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.634
But it's do or die
right now.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.069
This is the first ticket.
It's gotta be right.

27:02.137 --> 27:03.304
Coming!

27:03.371 --> 27:05.372
Salad remake.
Thank you.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.441
(Announcer)
With Nona's guidance,
Trev's redressed salads

27:07.509 --> 27:09.043
are finally leaving the pass.

27:09.110 --> 27:11.412
And both kitchens...
Runner, please.

27:11.479 --> 27:12.780
(Announcer)
Are off and running.

27:12.847 --> 27:13.847
Next up.
Next up.

27:13.915 --> 27:15.249
Table 30.

27:15.317 --> 27:16.550
(Announcer)
With the dining room filled

27:16.618 --> 27:17.384
with important guests...

27:17.452 --> 27:18.485
I like how this works.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.187
Yup.
Cheers.

27:20.255 --> 27:21.655
(Announcer)
And their futures at stake,

27:21.723 --> 27:23.123
both Chefs...

27:23.191 --> 27:24.825
Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.660
(Announcer)
Push to keep the momentum going.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.828
Mm.
Hell, yeah.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.030
Wow.
That's really good.

27:30.098 --> 27:32.967
Russell, 27 appetizers.
28 out.

27:33.034 --> 27:34.702
Right now,
it's neck and neck.

27:34.769 --> 27:36.370
Pick it up, guys, yeah?
Let's go.

27:36.438 --> 27:37.338
Both of you, let's go.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

27:37.405 --> 27:38.706
Let's do it, okay?

27:38.773 --> 27:39.773
(Announcer)
And now both teams

27:39.841 --> 27:41.208
are ready to send entrees.

27:41.276 --> 27:43.344
I need the beef
to start moving.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.312
(Announcer)
But first, Chef Ramsay...
What is this?

27:45.380 --> 27:47.047
(Announcer)
Has a question.

27:47.115 --> 27:47.948
Sabrina.
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

27:48.016 --> 27:49.483
What is this?

27:49.551 --> 27:51.085
I put a little--
I put a little stock, Chef.

27:51.152 --> 27:52.319
I won't do it anymore,
Chef.

27:52.387 --> 27:53.821
I don't want it
to dry out.

27:53.888 --> 27:55.723
Like, so I'll just add
a little bit of stock.

27:55.790 --> 27:57.524
You know, Chef Ramsay comes out
of [Bleep] Nowhere.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.193
You're stewing it!

27:59.260 --> 28:01.095
You're supposed to be
dry-roasting all the beef.

28:01.162 --> 28:02.262
Get it going.
I need it now.
Yes, Chef.

28:02.330 --> 28:04.832
You cannot stew beef.

28:04.899 --> 28:06.467
Sabrina, come on!

28:06.534 --> 28:07.634
Sabrina was boiling steaks.

28:07.702 --> 28:08.702
We've never done that.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.104
Come on, Sabrina!

28:10.171 --> 28:11.638
Meat's on its way,
Chef.

28:11.706 --> 28:14.975
Thank you.

28:15.043 --> 28:16.710
No, that's raw.
I'm not sending that.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.679
What's she doing?

28:18.747 --> 28:20.180
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>
<i>This is my [Bleep] Day.</i>

28:20.248 --> 28:21.281
And I'm not going down.

28:21.349 --> 28:22.850
If I'm the Chef,
it's up to me

28:22.917 --> 28:24.618
to get the blue team
back on track.

28:24.686 --> 28:25.619
And I'm fighting
to get this food out.

28:25.687 --> 28:27.755
Sabrina, switch.

28:27.822 --> 28:29.356
Vinny, Sabrina,
switch it.

28:29.424 --> 28:31.592
<i>Sabrina, get on fish.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:31.659 --> 28:33.994
Vinny, six beef on order
all day.

28:34.062 --> 28:35.729
Six beef.
Don't screw me, Vinny.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.232
Vinny completely [Bleep]
The scallops.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.967
But, you know,
a switch had to be made.

28:40.035 --> 28:41.368
Hey, switching them,
clever move.

28:41.436 --> 28:42.970
Very clever move,
yes?

28:43.038 --> 28:44.705
(Announcer)
Russell's quick decision...

28:44.773 --> 28:46.240
Let's go!
(Announcer)
Seems to be working.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.709
Whoa, Vinny...

28:48.777 --> 28:49.843
Good job.
Keep them going.

28:49.911 --> 28:51.412
No problem.

28:51.479 --> 28:53.180
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...

28:53.248 --> 28:54.948
Halibut right here.
Hot pan.

28:55.016 --> 28:56.583
(Announcer)
Boris is ready
with his first entree.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.985
Boris!
Yes, Chef.

28:59.187 --> 29:00.687
How long was it
in the oven?

29:00.755 --> 29:02.389
It was about--
nearly about four minutes.

29:02.457 --> 29:04.058
No, it's five minutes
in the oven. Come on.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.759
I'll put it back in the oven.
I'll put it back in the oven.

29:05.827 --> 29:06.860
Putting Boris on fish
is an absolute risky,

29:06.928 --> 29:08.295
risky move,
but no one

29:08.363 --> 29:09.163
is gonna drag me down
tonight.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.098
Take a deep breath.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.766
Is it done?
Don't bring it up twice raw.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.135
Chef.
Halibut's up, Chef.

29:15.203 --> 29:17.037
Boris!
Yes, Chef.

29:17.105 --> 29:18.806
It's raw.
Look at me.

29:18.873 --> 29:20.207
I told you
it better be cooked.

29:20.275 --> 29:22.042
Come on, Boris.
Come on.

29:22.110 --> 29:23.877
Get it together.
How long was it in the oven?

29:23.945 --> 29:25.379
It was in the oven
four minutes.

29:25.447 --> 29:26.547
Come here.
Come here.

29:26.614 --> 29:30.617
One, two, three, four, five.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.119
Five minutes
in the oven!

29:32.187 --> 29:33.554
Nona.
It needs to be--

29:33.621 --> 29:35.022
don't argue with me.

29:35.090 --> 29:35.956
It needs to be five minutes.
Yes, Chef.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.124
That's the final word.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.059
I got the shrimp.
I got it. I got it.

29:39.127 --> 29:40.627
All right, that's it.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.096
If it happens again,
I'm jumping over.

29:42.163 --> 29:43.397
Trev, I know how to do
my [Bleep] Job.

29:43.465 --> 29:44.631
I'm trying to do my job.
He's like-- [Blathers]

29:44.699 --> 29:46.166
I'm not a [Bleep] Child.

29:46.234 --> 29:48.402
I'm 38 years old.
I mean, come on.

29:48.470 --> 29:50.037
If it happens again,
I'm jumping over.

29:50.105 --> 29:52.072
I know.
[Stammers] Thank you.

29:52.140 --> 29:54.041
(Announcer)
It's one hour
into dinner service

29:54.109 --> 29:55.943
and Boris's mishandling
of the halibut...

29:56.010 --> 29:57.578
Come on, Boris.
Wake up.

29:57.645 --> 29:58.679
(Announcer)
Has slowed the flow of food

29:58.746 --> 29:59.980
leaving Nona's kitchen.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.715
And customers are getting edgy.

30:01.783 --> 30:03.450
It seems
like they're doing a lot

30:03.518 --> 30:04.651
back there,
but nothing's coming out.

30:04.719 --> 30:05.352
(Announcer)
And Russell's kitchen

30:05.420 --> 30:06.253
is pulling ahead.

30:06.321 --> 30:08.155
Thank you.
You're welcome.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.756
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,
back in the red kitchen...

30:09.824 --> 30:11.725
That fish, Boris.
Hot, hot.

30:11.793 --> 30:13.660
(Announcer)
Boris is hoping
the third time's the charm

30:13.728 --> 30:14.962
for his halibut.

30:15.029 --> 30:16.130
Boris.
Yes, Chef.

30:16.197 --> 30:17.331
<i>It's raw.</i>

30:17.398 --> 30:19.066
Oh, come on.
<i>It's still raw.</i>

30:19.134 --> 30:20.467
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>Come on, Boris.</i>

30:20.535 --> 30:22.069
You're [Bleep] Me over,
Boris.

30:22.137 --> 30:24.238
Right here.
I'm pretty hungry now.

30:24.305 --> 30:26.173
I'm starving.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.509
He's got one [Bleep] Piece
of fish to cook.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.144
Boris!
Let's go!

30:30.211 --> 30:32.112
What am I going to do
with Boris?

30:32.180 --> 30:35.115
He's just [Bleep] Me over
and over and over again.

30:35.183 --> 30:37.284
Nothing's coming out.
<i>(Boris)</i>
<i>Trev, I got it.</i>

30:37.352 --> 30:39.186
Trev, it's--
Trev, I got it.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.088
Boris, chill out
for a minute, okay?

30:41.156 --> 30:42.389
Boris was running around
like an idiot as usual.

30:42.457 --> 30:44.625
Now I have to jump over
and fix his mistakes.

30:44.692 --> 30:46.627
'Cause if I don't,
we're done.

30:46.694 --> 30:48.395
That's our [Bleep] Kitchen.

30:48.463 --> 30:49.897
Trev, come on, man.
I need to do my [Bleep] Job.

30:49.964 --> 30:51.732
Hey.
Argue later.

30:51.799 --> 30:55.536
Hey, if you two don't
shut the [Bleep] Up right now,

30:55.603 --> 30:57.004
I swear to God.

30:57.071 --> 30:59.006
(Gordon)
All of you, just stop.

31:04.519 --> 31:06.087
(Announcer)
It's the final dinner service.

31:06.154 --> 31:07.955
Boris, it's raw.

31:08.023 --> 31:09.723
(Announcer)
And Boris's weak performance
on fish...

31:09.791 --> 31:11.659
Just overcooked--

31:11.726 --> 31:13.260
if you two don't shut
the [Bleep] Up right now,

31:13.328 --> 31:14.829
I swear to God.

31:14.896 --> 31:16.397
(Announcer)
May result in Nona's dream

31:16.465 --> 31:18.199
going up in flames.

31:18.266 --> 31:19.967
All of you,
just stop.

31:20.035 --> 31:21.769
Get a grip, please.

31:21.837 --> 31:23.737
Let's go!
Trev, come on, man.

31:23.805 --> 31:25.406
I need to do my job.

31:25.474 --> 31:26.841
Trev, listen,
don't worry about it.

31:26.908 --> 31:28.008
I got it.
Here.

31:28.076 --> 31:29.577
I know how to cook fish.

31:29.644 --> 31:30.511
Shut the [Bleep] Up
and let me work.

31:30.579 --> 31:40.554
Hot, hot.

31:40.622 --> 31:42.089
Properly cooked a halibut.
Service.

31:42.157 --> 31:43.390
Good, good.
Well done.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.692
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,

31:44.759 --> 31:46.026
in the blue kitchen,
Russell...

31:46.094 --> 31:48.696
Order in. Fire a four top
and a three top.

31:48.763 --> 31:50.297
(Announcer)
Is determined to stay ahead.

31:50.365 --> 31:51.832
Two chicken.
Five beef.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.768
(Announcer)
And has fired two tables
at once.

31:54.836 --> 31:56.103
Vinny, I need
that [Bleep] Fast.

31:56.171 --> 31:57.538
I can't do it any faster.

31:57.606 --> 31:58.739
I'm fighting
to get this food out.

31:58.807 --> 32:00.074
I don't want to lose.

32:00.142 --> 32:01.709
That's what I'm thinking
is push, push, push.

32:01.776 --> 32:02.810
Hey, Vinny,
cut that [Bleep].

32:02.878 --> 32:05.312
<i>I need it.</i>
I'm slicing.

32:05.380 --> 32:07.114
Russell's whole goal was to,
like,

32:07.182 --> 32:08.082
push everything out
really, really fast.

32:08.150 --> 32:09.550
He's expecting miracles.

32:09.618 --> 32:10.985
Make sure it's seared
and ready to go.

32:11.052 --> 32:13.287
Unrealistic expectations.

32:13.355 --> 32:14.755
Beef in the window.

32:14.823 --> 32:16.023
(Gordon)
Russell.

32:16.091 --> 32:17.391
Are you sending a four
and a three

32:17.459 --> 32:19.059
at the same time?
Yes, Chef.

32:19.127 --> 32:20.694
In the history of hell's
kitchen, we've never sent a four

32:20.762 --> 32:22.029
and a three
at the same time.

32:22.097 --> 32:23.697
Runner, please.
Let's go.

32:23.765 --> 32:25.166
Hey, urgency.
Move.

32:25.233 --> 32:26.200
(Announcer)
Russell's persistence

32:26.268 --> 32:27.501
has paid off.

32:27.569 --> 32:28.636
And food is now leaving
the kitchen

32:28.703 --> 32:29.570
at a rapid pace.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.007
Unfortunately,
some of it

32:33.074 --> 32:35.976
is being rapidly returned.

32:36.044 --> 32:37.478
Chef, table 11.
They said it's too rare.

32:37.546 --> 32:39.813
Russell, you cannot do that.

32:39.881 --> 32:41.982
Hey, hey.

32:42.050 --> 32:43.851
I need you to flash this meat,
and I need all-new garnish.

32:43.919 --> 32:45.352
Okay.

32:45.420 --> 32:46.787
Let's go!
Russell.

32:46.855 --> 32:48.255
Just two seconds with me now.
Look at me.

32:48.323 --> 32:49.990
<i>L.A. Market doesn't run</i>
<i>like this.</i>

32:50.058 --> 32:51.425
One table at a time, yeah?
Yes, Chef.

32:51.493 --> 32:53.060
(Announcer)
While Russell suffers a setback,

32:53.128 --> 32:54.828
in the red kitchen, Nona...

32:54.896 --> 32:56.664
Order in.

32:56.731 --> 32:58.699
(Announcer)
Is determined to keep
the momentum going.

32:58.767 --> 33:00.467
Vip. It's my husband.
Don't [Bleep] It up.

33:00.535 --> 33:02.803
Entree--
one beef, three minutes.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.071
(All)
Yes, Chef.

33:04.139 --> 33:05.806
Put some pep
in your step, Melissa.

33:05.874 --> 33:07.741
It's coming, baby.
Let's go. Right now.

33:07.809 --> 33:09.476
This is my husband's ticket.

33:09.544 --> 33:12.046
And I have busted my ass
day in and day out

33:12.113 --> 33:13.447
for my family.

33:13.515 --> 33:15.249
I want them
to be so proud.

33:15.317 --> 33:18.352
I want to show them
it has all been worth it.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.120
That better be [Bleep] Hot.
It's good. It's hot.

33:20.188 --> 33:22.489
Coming right up
with your beef.

33:22.557 --> 33:25.125
Melissa, it's raw!

33:25.193 --> 33:26.794
I've been making
rookie mistakes,

33:26.861 --> 33:28.662
but I'm better than this.

33:28.730 --> 33:30.197
And I'm gonna prove it to Nona,
and it's gonna come out.

33:30.265 --> 33:31.265
Get over there.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.800
Get over there right now

33:32.867 --> 33:34.201
<i>and do it again.</i>
Yes, Chef.

33:34.269 --> 33:36.203
It better be cooked.

33:36.271 --> 33:39.206
(Announcer)
It's over 2 1/2 hours
into dinner service,

33:39.274 --> 33:41.108
and after overcoming
Boris's miscues,

33:41.176 --> 33:42.876
Nona has another obstacle
in front of her...

33:42.944 --> 33:45.179
Don't [Bleep] It up, Melissa.
Let's go.

33:45.247 --> 33:47.014
(Announcer)
Melissa, who is sinking
on the meat station.

33:47.082 --> 33:50.150
Meanwhile, over
in the blue kitchen, Russell...

33:50.218 --> 33:52.086
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Rob, I need one order</i>
<i>of ravioli.</i>

33:52.153 --> 33:53.320
(Announcer)
Is focused on the finish line.

33:53.388 --> 33:54.588
Rob, move!

33:54.656 --> 33:56.190
<i>Got it.</i>
What are you doing?

33:56.258 --> 33:58.392
Looking
for more tomato water.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.493
It's one order.

33:59.561 --> 34:00.494
I'm out of water.

34:00.562 --> 34:02.329
But you need to tell me

34:02.397 --> 34:03.297
before you're out.

34:03.365 --> 34:04.698
Just went and looked.

34:04.766 --> 34:06.066
Thought we had a backup
back there.

34:06.134 --> 34:07.635
Come on!
Are you serious?

34:07.702 --> 34:09.168
I need to send this food.

34:09.237 --> 34:10.070
I don't know
what Rob's deal is.

34:10.138 --> 34:11.705
It's killing me.

34:11.773 --> 34:14.041
Rob, when you've five left,
you got to tell the Chef.

34:14.109 --> 34:16.277
You've now got
no tomato water left.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.444
<i>There's nothing going out.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

34:20.348 --> 34:21.815
Get some veg stock.

34:21.882 --> 34:22.949
Don't just stand there
and look around.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.351
Come on!

34:24.418 --> 34:25.719
It's right [Bleep] Here.
Where are you going?

34:25.786 --> 34:27.353
Get working, man.

34:27.422 --> 34:29.188
Come on.
Relax.

34:29.257 --> 34:31.225
Just sitting here.
Come on, rob.

34:31.293 --> 34:33.726
Don't snap. I'm in no mood
for this [Bleep] At all.

34:33.795 --> 34:35.195
Hey, come over here
and cook,

34:35.263 --> 34:36.929
because he can't do it.
Come on.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.799
You're [Bleep] Me.
No, this is my day.

34:38.867 --> 34:40.534
<i>Get over here, Jillian.</i>
I'm nervous.

34:40.601 --> 34:42.136
This is not a good situation
at all.

34:42.203 --> 34:43.536
It's done.
You're [Bleep] Yourself.

34:43.605 --> 34:46.974
Hey, hey.
I'll run the show.

34:47.042 --> 34:48.375
Rob, you know,
you really pissed off

34:48.443 --> 34:49.710
the wrong [Bleep] Person.

34:49.777 --> 34:51.210
You better [Bleep] Move out
of the way, bro.

34:51.279 --> 34:52.079
Because I'm about
to slap [Bleep] You, bitch.

34:52.147 --> 34:53.380
Step back.

34:53.447 --> 34:55.815
Step back? Hey, hey.
Don't touch me.

34:55.884 --> 34:57.016
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

35:04.296 --> 35:06.597
(Announcer)
As the final dinner service
nears the three-hour mark,

35:06.665 --> 35:08.032
on the blue side...

35:08.100 --> 35:10.001
Come on, rob.
Dude, dude, step back.

35:10.068 --> 35:12.336
Step back?
(Announcer)
Russell's aggressiveness

35:12.404 --> 35:13.771
may be backfiring.
Hey, hey.

35:13.839 --> 35:14.839
<i>I'll run the show.</i>

35:14.907 --> 35:16.774
It's about fighting back

35:16.842 --> 35:18.976
and controlling the team and not
letting them control you.

35:19.044 --> 35:20.011
You know, I'm not gonna go out
like a chump.

35:20.078 --> 35:21.812
Hey, hey.
Don't touch me.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.681
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

35:23.749 --> 35:25.116
Oh, no.

35:25.183 --> 35:26.784
Hey, just get
the [Bleep] Working.

35:26.852 --> 35:28.152
(Announcer)
While Russell continues

35:28.220 --> 35:29.453
to crack the whip
in his kitchen...

35:29.521 --> 35:31.088
Bring it to me.
Come on.

35:31.156 --> 35:32.690
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen, Nona...

35:32.758 --> 35:34.292
It's my husband.
Don't [Bleep] It up.

35:34.359 --> 35:35.826
(Announcer)
Is doing the same.

35:35.894 --> 35:36.761
<i>(Nona)</i>
<i>Put some pep</i>
<i>in your step, Melissa.</i>

35:36.828 --> 35:37.895
Non,
your beef.

35:37.963 --> 35:39.230
That's perfect.
He'll eat it. Table 30.

35:39.298 --> 35:40.464
(Announcer)
And now both teams...

35:40.532 --> 35:41.699
Urgency.
Urgency.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.167
(Announcer)
Are hitting their stride.

35:43.235 --> 35:44.535
Now we're rolling.
Come on.

35:44.603 --> 35:47.338
Mm.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.373
Runner, please.
<i>Enjoy your meal.</i>

35:49.441 --> 35:51.575
I think Nona did
a great job with this.

35:51.643 --> 35:53.144
Entrees.
Let's go.

35:53.211 --> 35:54.712
One beef, one chicken,
one halibut, one veggie.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.947
Coming up
with raviolis.

35:56.014 --> 35:57.448
We're all working together.

35:57.516 --> 35:59.317
The whole kitchen gelled.

36:07.526 --> 36:08.626
Sabrina, move your ass.
Let's go.

36:08.694 --> 36:09.694
I feel like I just ran
a marathon

36:09.761 --> 36:10.928
doing the hurdles.

36:10.996 --> 36:12.630
I want to move.
Let's go.

36:12.698 --> 36:14.231
But I'm pretty happy
with my overall performance.

36:14.299 --> 36:15.433
I've had such a great run,

36:15.500 --> 36:16.934
and I've been so consistent.

36:17.002 --> 36:24.275
I expect to win.

36:25.811 --> 36:26.744
Later, Chef.

36:26.812 --> 36:28.546
You all did a great job.

36:28.613 --> 36:31.482
Bye, guys.

36:31.550 --> 36:34.552
This is it.
Pins and needles.

36:34.619 --> 36:36.620
The anxiety level
is through the [Bleep] Roof.

36:36.688 --> 36:40.558
My heart right now
is going 15,000 miles an hour.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.226
I just want to win.

36:42.294 --> 36:44.362
And I'll be really disappointed
if I get second place.

36:44.429 --> 36:46.063
Man, I'm nervous.

36:46.131 --> 36:48.432
I'm just teetering
back and forth

36:48.500 --> 36:51.769
between nausea...
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

36:51.837 --> 36:54.939
And bursting
into hysterics.

36:55.007 --> 36:58.609

Trev, I got it.
Boris, chill out
for a minute, okay?

37:34.279 --> 37:35.980
If you two don't shut
the [Bleep] Up right now,

I swear to God.

37:51.029 --> 37:53.097
Hello.
Russell, I've made my decision.

37:53.165 --> 37:54.432
I need you and Nona

37:54.499 --> 37:55.833

37:55.901 --> 37:57.468
Okay.

Are we going?
We are.

38:00.806 --> 38:02.840

38:02.908 --> 38:05.109
My entire future
depends on tonight.

38:05.177 --> 38:06.944
This is my night,
the night of my dreams.

38:07.012 --> 38:08.712
(Nona)
This is definitely one

38:08.780 --> 38:10.414
of the biggest nights
of my life.

38:10.482 --> 38:12.483
I have fought so hard
to get here.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.453
And I didn't fight this long
to go home.

38:20.592 --> 38:23.060
Okay,
listen to me.

38:23.128 --> 38:26.163
This is the moment
you've both been waiting for.

38:26.231 --> 38:29.700
One of you is about to realize
the dream of a lifetime.

38:29.768 --> 38:34.505
I've thoroughly scrutinized
the customer comment cards.

38:34.573 --> 38:37.141

It's so close

38:59.231 --> 39:00.831
Good luck.

39:00.899 --> 39:03.968
