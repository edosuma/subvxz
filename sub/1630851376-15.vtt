00:08.051 --> 00:09.966
<i>Sarah had her heart set
on directing</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.968
<i>the spring musical
at Windmount Academy,</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:14.188
<i>so she volunteered to host
the art department fundraiser</i>

00:14.231 --> 00:16.190
<i>at Connor's house
to help her get the job.</i>

00:16.233 --> 00:18.627
<i>Despite the pressure,
she was handling things well.</i>

00:18.670 --> 00:20.933
So everyone remember
for tonight,

00:20.977 --> 00:22.892
the dress code is smart casual.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.720
- Does that mean I can wear a--
- No hoodie.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.113
- Okay.
- Sorry.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.245
I just--I really want tonight
to be perfect, that's all.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.161
I had no idea
you loved musicals so much.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.206
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.209
You know, I know my "Follies"
from my "Fantasticks."

00:35.252 --> 00:38.125
But by the ninth grade,
our mother, the great thespian,

00:38.168 --> 00:40.997
had critiqued
all of the joy out of it.

00:41.302 --> 00:45.262
So directing this show is my
chance to reclaim that glory.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.003
I bet you were
a cute Peter Pan.

00:47.047 --> 00:47.743
Oh.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.614
I was breathtaking.

00:49.658 --> 00:50.572
Remember when Mom
made us audition

00:50.615 --> 00:51.573
for "Annie Get Your Gun"?

00:51.616 --> 00:52.878
I've blocked it out.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.184
Matching outfits.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.360
Blocked it out, Tom.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.710
Also, fair warning:
Mom and Dad will be there.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.756
Oh, no. Why?

01:00.799 --> 01:01.713
I mentioned it.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.019
Mom heard musical theater,

01:03.063 --> 01:05.239
Dad heard
unlimited pigs in a blanket,

01:05.282 --> 01:06.240
and now
there's no stopping them.

01:13.943 --> 01:16.380
So have you decided
how you're gonna get pregnant

01:16.424 --> 01:18.252
and forever alter
the course of your lives?

01:18.295 --> 01:19.731
Well, it's still early,

01:19.775 --> 01:21.777
but we are looking
at sperm donors.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.300
The clinic lets you
scroll through

01:23.344 --> 01:25.172
and look at exactly
what you want.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.869
- Ooh.
- Huh.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.175
Yeah, it's like Build-A-Bear
but for dads.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.395
Check out our top pick.
- A multilingual bassoonist.

01:31.439 --> 01:35.399
130 IQ, left-handed,
ample body hair.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.271
Oh, uh,
we'll probably keep looking.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.402
Yeah.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.362
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

01:43.929 --> 01:45.279
You can just put that
right down the hall,

01:45.322 --> 01:46.410
next to the bathroom.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.846
Thank you so much.
Ladies, hi!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.370
Can you put those
in the center of the tables?

01:49.413 --> 01:51.372
Thank you so...

01:51.415 --> 01:52.416
much.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.331
Lupe?
- Hmm?

01:54.723 --> 01:56.159
Is that how he's
arranging those?

01:56.203 --> 01:57.247
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Thank you.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.903
You're on door duty.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.167
So the goal for tonight

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
is to impress Allison,
the head of school.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.302
Should we go over your lines
one more time

02:08.345 --> 02:09.303
before she arrives?

02:09.346 --> 02:10.217
I think we're good, right?

02:11.261 --> 02:14.438
Oh, um, wow, that Sarah
sure can handle

02:14.482 --> 02:15.918
responsibility.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.181
That Sarah
is a creative dynamo.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.183
Is there such a thing
as raising too much money?

02:20.227 --> 02:23.317
Well, I guess we'll find out
with that Sarah in charge.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.014
Very natural.
Good, I feel good.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.450
That's good.
- Oh, by the way,

02:26.494 --> 02:28.104
you can forget
about the hairy bassoonist.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.019
We have fallen
for a travel writer

02:30.062 --> 02:31.412
who speaks five languages.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.153
Oh.

02:33.196 --> 02:36.068
Two of those languages
are Dothraki and Elvish.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.157
- Dothraki?
- Yikes.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.897
Yeah.
- Mm, yeah, swipe left.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.334
I don't think
it works that way.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.510
Oh, no, it does.
- Everything does these days.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.207
It's too bad they
don't have the technology

02:44.251 --> 02:46.557
to just mash two eggs together
to make a baby.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.864
- Ooh, like a lesbian omelet.
- Gross.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.431
But yeah,
I mean, it'd be nice

02:50.474 --> 02:52.389
if we both shared DNA
with the baby.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.304
Well, some people do use
family members

02:54.348 --> 02:57.394
as donors, which we could try.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.963
That would mean Tom
or Connor stepping up.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.402
Huh.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.319
So we'd have to...

03:09.798 --> 03:11.103
Oh, sex is not involved.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.366
Okay, yeah, no sex.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.368
Yeah, obviously
sex is not involved.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.414
Wait, so--
so Tom or Connor would be

03:17.458 --> 03:19.503
the father/uncle to their

03:19.547 --> 03:21.592
son/daughter/nephew/niece.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.290
Whew, that's a lot
of slashes.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.248
Yeah, so many slashes.
Too many?

03:25.292 --> 03:26.554
I mean, it's a lot
to process.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.077
It'd be kind of...

03:28.730 --> 03:30.122
amazing.
- Complicated--amazing!

03:30.166 --> 03:31.341
- Right?
- Yes.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.647
I mean, my sperm,
Denise's egg.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.344
That kid'd be unstoppable.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.432
Totally.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.042
And that would--that would--

03:37.086 --> 03:39.436
wow, that would be
such a beautiful act.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.308
But, oh! You--

03:41.351 --> 03:43.048
Tom got a vasectomy.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.660
So no more gas in that tank.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.183
No, honey, remember?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.445
Before the procedure,
the doctor froze

03:48.489 --> 03:49.664
some samples for us,
just in case.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.101
Right. Thank you so much
for reminding all of us.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.408
Either way, that would be
a mute point,

03:54.451 --> 03:58.063
because Sarah and Denise would
obviously go with my sperm.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.543
Oh, would they?
Well, first of all,

03:59.587 --> 04:00.762
it's not a mute point.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.546
It is a moot point,

04:02.590 --> 04:04.374
which is exhibit A
as to why the superior choice

04:04.418 --> 04:06.246
would obviously be
my sperm.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.290
Can we stop using that word?

04:07.334 --> 04:09.553
Fine, because
the choice is clear.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.252
It would be me and my s--

04:13.253 --> 04:14.341
spice.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.342
My spice.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.604
Okay, guests are arriving,

04:16.647 --> 04:18.388
so can we argue
about this later

04:18.432 --> 04:19.694
or never?
- Yeah.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.174
<i>♪ I'm so happy
that my sweetie ♪</i>

04:22.218 --> 04:24.481
♪ Said that she'll be

04:24.525 --> 04:26.396
♪ Said
that she'll be ♪

04:26.440 --> 04:30.313
♪ Mine forever

04:31.706 --> 04:33.664
They were very pitchy.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.364
Let's hear it for the
Windmount Alumni Singers, huh?

04:37.407 --> 04:39.148
Chills, I have chills!

04:39.191 --> 04:40.802
Quite an event, Sarah.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.152
Brava.
- It's not about me, though.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.327
It's about the school.

04:44.719 --> 04:48.244
By the way, I heard
that you need a director

04:48.288 --> 04:50.420
for the spring musical.
- Yes.

04:50.464 --> 04:53.336
Sweet, dear Mrs. Agatone
is finally retiring.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.382
Well, that--that directing
job, it sounds like a--

04:55.425 --> 04:57.558
like a really exciting opportunity.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.603
That's what Mr. Zarrow
said too.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.257
- Mr. Zarrow.
- Mm-hmm.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.606
The algebra teacher?

05:02.650 --> 05:04.652
Yes, he played Tevye
in an off-Broadway

05:04.695 --> 05:06.436
production
of "Fiddler on the Roof."

05:06.480 --> 05:08.438
In fact, he's auctioning off
that fiddle tonight.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.570
Super.

05:09.831 --> 05:10.658
Super.
Cool, cool.

05:10.701 --> 05:14.488
Uh, the truth is,
I wanted to...

05:14.531 --> 05:15.793
Throw my chapeau

05:15.837 --> 05:18.535
in the ole ring-a-ding
as well.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.797
I wanted--

05:19.841 --> 05:21.364
my ring--the ring--

05:21.408 --> 05:22.278
I wanted to throw
my hat in the ring.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.845
Oh!
How fun.

05:23.888 --> 05:26.326
You know, I did some
performing back in the day.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.414
I don't know
if you're familiar

05:27.457 --> 05:28.980
with the Sacramento Playhouse?

05:29.024 --> 05:30.547
Once upon a time,
I trod the boards

05:30.591 --> 05:32.984
in a little ole show
called "Les Mis."

05:33.028 --> 05:35.596
Oh, that was a dream.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.989
Mother and daughter
in the classic tale

05:38.033 --> 05:40.340
of justice and redemption.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.604
I played Fantine,
Sarah was young Eponine.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.389
She didn't have any lines
and a wee bit of stage fright,

05:46.433 --> 05:48.913
but she really sang
the loudest.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.394
Thank you for that, Mom.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
Should we take a lap?
Let's take a lap.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.401
How do you feel
about the spice thing?

05:58.445 --> 05:59.663
I don't know.
It seems kinda wrong.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.622
- It's incredibly wrong.
- Thank you.

06:01.665 --> 06:02.840
I mean, how could they
even consider

06:02.884 --> 06:04.625
choosing Connor over me?
It's crazy.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.409
Right?
Of course, that.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.455
But also, um,

06:08.890 --> 06:09.934
I just don't love the idea.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.545
You'd be the father
of your sister's child.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.503
Their kid would be your kid.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.591
Where would the boundaries be?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.593
Yeah, I guess
it'd be complicated.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.640
I mean, it'd be such
an amazing gift to them.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.685
There are so many
other gifts we could get them--

06:21.729 --> 06:22.686
a gravity blanket.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.558
Oh, my God, I love those.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.386
Feels like you're getting
a warm hug.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.563
I would just hate
to disappoint her.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.478
Well, look, nothing has
to be decided tonight, okay?

06:31.521 --> 06:32.957
Just try to keep an open mind.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.698
Right,
I'll try and be supportive.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.874
So freakin' supportive.
- That's the spirit.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.050
Hey, guys. Hey!

06:39.311 --> 06:41.488
Have you said hello
to Allison yet?

06:41.531 --> 06:42.837
- Hey.
- Hi, it's good to see you.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.622
Oh, and yeah, we were just

06:45.666 --> 06:46.623
talking about you, Sarah.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.972
Weird that you...
- Oh, weird.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.583
Just walked up,
'cause I was saying that

06:49.626 --> 06:50.845
my favorite quality
about you is your...

06:51.193 --> 06:52.150
stick-to-itiveness.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.717
And I was like, "Really?

06:53.761 --> 06:56.677
'Cause for me, it's all about
her creative vision."

06:56.720 --> 06:58.635
Guys, stop it.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.810
You're embarrassing me.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.986
That's so nice
and so unexpected.

07:02.030 --> 07:02.726
Thank you.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.164
Look, of course I'd be
Sarah and Denise's choice.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.644
Look at my SAT scores.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.037
Plus, I mean,
I was on "Jeopardy!"

07:09.080 --> 07:10.604
- "Teen Jeopardy!"
- Still counts.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.996
I'm the complete package,
all right?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.694
Looks, personality.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.260
I got in early on Tesla.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.045
I got out of GE at its peak.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.829
I clearly have the better DNA.

07:18.873 --> 07:19.656
Okay.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.702
What does DNA stand for?

07:21.745 --> 07:23.138
What does DN--

07:24.966 --> 07:26.533
Definitely nice abs.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.492
Thanks, Magic Mike.
It's deoxyribonucleic acid.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.102
Let's see those abs, come on.
Whip 'em out.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.669
No, come on. I haven't worked
out lately. I was sick.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.757
You've been sick
your whole life?

07:33.801 --> 07:35.063
I'm sick of you.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.195
Are you talking about
that ridiculous donation idea?

07:37.239 --> 07:38.675
How do you know about that?

07:38.719 --> 07:39.763
Even in a crowded party,

07:39.807 --> 07:41.678
your mother homes in
on the best gossip.

07:41.722 --> 07:42.984
She hears a word
like "sperm" and,

07:43.027 --> 07:44.594
fwwt, like a bat.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.509
Spice.
We're calling it spice now.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.858
I don't care
what you call it.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.207
It's perverse.
- Well, Mom,

07:49.251 --> 07:50.774
there wouldn't be
any sex involved, okay?

07:50.818 --> 07:52.254
Denise was clear about that.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.734
Yeah, I don't think
it's an issue, sweetie.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.736
Look, Denise
isn't a blood relative.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.651
And I know
for a fact that we

07:57.694 --> 07:59.609
Hayworth men
are top-notch donors.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.047
How do you know that, Dad?

08:03.091 --> 08:04.962
Oh-ho-ho, my swimmers
have been tested.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.355
Remarkable motility.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.792
Yeah, I may be old, but...

08:08.836 --> 08:10.185
the spice can still cook.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.752
- Great. I'm never gonna...
- Gross.

08:11.795 --> 08:12.970
Stop throwing up.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.059
Hey.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.844
Oh, hey, anything good?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.193
That ski trip looked great,

08:18.236 --> 08:20.021
if you wanna take out
a 30-year loan.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.718
Hey, thanks again

08:21.762 --> 08:24.765
for being so open
to the whole spice thing.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.810
I know it was
probably like, "Whoa."

08:26.854 --> 08:29.421
"Whoa, that's awesome."

08:29.465 --> 08:30.814
- Okay.
- Yes!

08:30.858 --> 08:32.381
I mean, even though
it's a hypothetical,

08:32.424 --> 08:34.688
I'm still moved by the idea
that the baby could be

08:34.731 --> 08:36.994
genetically half me
and half Sarah.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.649
Me too.
And we really wanna help.

08:39.693 --> 08:43.871
Tom would be the father
and uncle to the same child.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.916
How many guys
can say that, huh?

08:45.960 --> 08:49.746
I'd be
the aunt/stepmother.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.142
Well, Sarah and I
would obviously be the moms.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.447
- Yes.
- But...

08:55.491 --> 08:57.841
we would want you
to play a big part.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.582
It'd be weird
if we didn't, right?

08:59.626 --> 09:01.845
I mean, we're already
such a big happy family.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.368
It'd be like that, just...

09:03.847 --> 09:04.892
times a million.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.154
Times a million.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.025
Yeah. Okay.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.506

09:10.550 --> 09:12.377

You're a smooth operator,
aren't ya, algebra man?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.567
- Hey.
- Yeah?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.438
Uh, I know I'm the one
who brought it up.

09:29.481 --> 09:30.918
But I'm having
second thoughts

09:30.961 --> 09:32.484
about using your brothers
as donors.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.225
Just, like, second thoughts,
third thoughts,

09:34.269 --> 09:36.358
a lot of thoughts.
- Okay. It was just an idea.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.099
We haven't even
talked it through.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.231
And I don't wanna do anything
that you're uncomfortable with.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.711
Yeah, I just--

09:41.755 --> 09:44.018
I'm just worried about having
the donor so...

09:44.366 --> 09:45.106
present.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.630
But Marina is really into it.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.806
She's, like,
so freakin' supportive.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.112
But how do you tell someone
you're not sure

09:51.155 --> 09:52.330
if you wanna have
her husband's baby?

09:52.374 --> 09:54.028
Well, that sounds
like a really

09:54.071 --> 09:57.161
tough conversation that you
probably shouldn't have here.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.815
I'm sorry,
am I distracting you?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.425
Honestly, yes.
I love you so much,

10:00.469 --> 10:01.731
but right now, I'm just worried

10:01.775 --> 10:03.124
that I'm losing
this directing gig.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.734
Well. just get
onstage and sing.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.215
You're better than this guy.
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.433
I mean, he's really good.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.348
No, you're right. I am.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.220
This whole thing's so stupid.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.265
I mean, how could we prove
who's superior anyway?

10:14.309 --> 10:15.919
- There's no way to measure it.
- Yeah.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.095
Hypothetically, how can we even
figure out who's better?

10:37.158 --> 10:37.680
Two.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.121
Ooh.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.349
Come on.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.393
No, I got it! I got it.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.921
- One.
- Whoo.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.488
Now, you like math,
so let's see, I did ten.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.013
Okay, yes, you can
bench-press more than me.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.363
And you beat me
at arm wrestling

11:08.406 --> 11:09.364
even though my elbow slipped.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.539
Your elbow did not slip.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.888
But I destroyed you
at trivia.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.542
The app rated me an Einstein.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.717
What did you get?
Let's see.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
Oh, yeah,
"Thanks for playing."

11:16.545 --> 11:19.679
That's just the app being nice.
- So you know nerd facts.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.898
Big deal. "Oh, oh, I'm Tom.
Look at me.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.552
I know that Benjamin Franklin

11:23.595 --> 11:25.685
wasn't 'technically'
a president."

11:25.728 --> 11:26.729
Stop saying "technically."

11:26.773 --> 11:27.948
He just--he wasn't.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.384
Technically.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.343
What? Okay.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.694
Look, Sarah and Denise--
this isn't about them

11:34.737 --> 11:36.217
anymore, okay?
It's about you and me.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.697
It's about how you're always
trying to make me feel

11:37.740 --> 11:39.263
like I'm less of a man.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.091
No, it's about how you
always roll your eyes at me

11:41.135 --> 11:43.050
every time
I don't know something.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.138
Yeah, just like that.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.356
You just did it,

11:45.400 --> 11:46.662
and with the little
head shake too.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.795
The full Tom.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.449
I think you would love.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.147
It'd probably go for
a lot of money, though,

11:53.190 --> 11:54.452
so you might want
to get on that.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.977
Hey, this is
quite the fundraiser.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.196
I would even call it
a fun-raiser.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.157
So happy to support
the arts at Windmount.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.813
I'll do anything
to help out these rich kids.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.031
Oh, are you
a parent at the school?

12:08.075 --> 12:09.598
Hmm?

12:09.641 --> 12:10.991
Oh, no, I was just avoiding

12:11.034 --> 12:12.557
an awkward conversation. Sorry.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.089
Are you going
to sing tonight?

12:22.132 --> 12:24.004
I am, I think, maybe.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.441
It doesn't quite sound
like you've settled on a key.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.356
- Mom, I'm doing my best.
- Hey, I'm not criticizing.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.053
That's exactly
what you're doing.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.316
Oh, pardon me
for trying.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.971
Mother pheasant plucker
plucks mother.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.237
So how do you rank
the kids at Windmount,

12:40.281 --> 12:41.935
you know, to figure out
which one's the best?

12:41.978 --> 12:43.893
It's gotta be, like,
academic ability, right?

12:43.937 --> 12:46.243
No, no, probably,
like, a all-around thing,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.115
you know,
which kids just got it.

12:48.158 --> 12:51.161
I can assure you we would
never rank our students.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.510
- Mm.
- I know you have to say that

12:52.554 --> 12:54.730
to the parents,
but between us, come on.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.820
If this is about Gretchen,
she's doing very well.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.300
Oh, no, that's cool.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.605
But no, this is this about
him and I.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.390
- It's "him and me."
- Very good, Tom.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.870
- Damn it.
- Nice.

13:03.913 --> 13:07.134
Hey, hey.
Guys, what is happening?

13:07.177 --> 13:09.092
Allison, have you tried
the crab cakes, by the way?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.398
Because they are going
like hotcakes.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.834
So you better
go get some, girl.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.053
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.272
Head on--head on over there.
Guys?

13:15.316 --> 13:16.273
What, we're just
trying to figure out

13:16.317 --> 13:17.318
which one of us is the best.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.362
Yeah, for the spice thing.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.887
The sperm.
- Yeah, spice is sperm.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.889
I know.
Look, neither of you is better.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.282
Now, leave Allison alone, and
stop screwing up my fundraiser.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.023
- Sorry.
- Fine.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.938
If you want to be of use,
go help Lupe with the dishes.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.027
Go!

13:35.118 --> 13:36.424
Sarah said
we should help you.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.991
Oh, great...

13:38.818 --> 13:39.949
Thank you, Sarah.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.211
I can load the dishwasher.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.473
Nah, I'll do it.
I'm faster.

13:42.517 --> 13:43.779
Come on, man,
it's not about speed.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.912
Seeing how many dishes
you can load in a dishwasher

13:45.955 --> 13:47.783
is a good test
of spatial reasoning.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.700
So it's a test
of the mental and the physical.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.268
You go first. I'll time you.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.225
Let's do this.

13:57.749 --> 13:58.838
Done.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.665
- 4:16.
- Oh!

14:00.709 --> 14:02.450
A tie, really? Come on.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.843
- Best two out of three?
- Yeah.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.674
Are you taking
dirty dishes

14:09.718 --> 14:10.893
out of the dishwasher?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.548
Uh, it's complicated.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.810
Get out of my kitchen.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.985
Out, out!

14:16.029 --> 14:17.595
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.728
So having
a dish-loading race

14:19.771 --> 14:21.904
to see who's got
the strongest spice.

14:21.948 --> 14:22.862
No.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.212
both: Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.213
Well, there's no point
in that.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.431
There's a science to this.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.042
You know,
back when I was at MIT,

14:29.085 --> 14:30.695
my frat brothers and I
got to wondering

14:30.739 --> 14:33.350
which one of us
is the best genetic specimen.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.396
- Frat life.
- Yeah.

14:35.439 --> 14:39.008
So we came up with the
Higgs-Nathanson Reflex Test.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.184
It's a measure of both
mental and physical acuity

14:41.228 --> 14:42.229
to help you determine

14:42.272 --> 14:44.579
superior DNA.
- How's it work?

14:44.622 --> 14:47.669
Well, try to follow me here.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.367
Subject one
extends his extremities

14:50.411 --> 14:51.891
in a rigid position, like so.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.110
Subject two
extends his extremities

14:54.154 --> 14:56.852
palms up
underneath subject one's.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.420
Subject two then attempts
to make forceful contact

14:59.463 --> 15:02.031
with subject one prior
to subject one retracting.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.557
Brains, brawn,
it takes them both.

15:06.601 --> 15:10.126
- Yeah... Dad, that's slapsies.
- You say what?

15:10.170 --> 15:11.432
You just described slapsies.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.955
It's a game kids
have been playing forever.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.392
I don't think so.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.525
We got a research grant
for this.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.353
Yeah.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.010
- Oh.
- Oh.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.185
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.490
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.231
Where have you been?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.886
- Oh, just mingling.
- Yeah, me too.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.107
Funny story, I put in a bid
for the wine weekend in Napa.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.195
- Ah!
- Yeah.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.805
But I'm having
second thoughts.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.633
You know
when something seems like

15:38.676 --> 15:40.374
it's a great idea at first,
but then you think about it,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.550
and you're not so sure?

15:42.593 --> 15:43.855
Has that ever happened to you?

15:43.899 --> 15:46.554
Uh, well, not with wine.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.034
But are you having
second thoughts about

15:48.077 --> 15:49.949
the spice donor thing?

15:53.953 --> 15:54.997
No.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.131
Nope. I'm all in.
- Great. Same.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.089
Hey-o.
both: Hey-o!

16:00.133 --> 16:02.048
So I got this great app
for the kids.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.093
It combines faces, right?

16:04.137 --> 16:07.183
I mean, they usually use it
with themselves and the cat.

16:07.227 --> 16:10.839
How would you like to see
maybe Tom's and your kid?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.058
- That's okay.
- Oh, I don't think anyone

16:12.101 --> 16:12.928
wants to see that. <i></i>

16:12.972 --> 16:14.886
all: Oh.

16:14.930 --> 16:19.108
Okay. How about
Connor's and Denise's kid?

16:19.152 --> 16:21.197
- Uh, no, thanks.
- Please, no one wants this.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.111
Oy.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.027
- Oh.
- That's really bad.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.029
I paid $1.99
for this damn thing.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.555
Did you just--

16:32.295 --> 16:34.689
you just--you just said,
"No one wants this."

16:35.037 --> 16:38.301
Um, I know your heart
was set on it.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.868
And it would be
such a noble act.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.130
But I have been
thinking about it,

16:41.174 --> 16:43.785
and I'm not sure
I wanna do it.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.091
Oh, my God.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.614
Me neither.
- You don't?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.833
- No, it's a bad idea.
- It's the worst idea!

16:48.877 --> 16:51.010
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry! I love you!

16:51.053 --> 16:53.229
I love you too.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.796
I just didn't wanna hurt
your feelings.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.537
I didn't wanna hurt
your feelings.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.755
From now on,

16:58.147 --> 16:59.975
let's promise to always hurt
each other's feelings.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.063
Always.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.847
Attention, everyone.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.936
I am proud to announce
that we raised

17:04.980 --> 17:07.069
more money than ever before!

17:08.375 --> 17:11.030
Huh?
Take that, last year

17:11.073 --> 17:12.161
and every other year.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.859
And on a personal note,
I just wanna say

17:14.903 --> 17:17.079
that I have been
so inspired watching

17:17.123 --> 17:19.081
all these performers
here tonight.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.649
It just reminds me that...

17:25.000 --> 17:25.957
Here we go.

18:46.995 --> 18:47.996
Thank you so much.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.432
And that's a good night

18:49.476 --> 18:51.217
on the Windmount fundraiser.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
Look, obviously
it goes without saying

18:55.960 --> 18:57.875
that we're so sorry.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.138
Slapsies, really?

18:59.181 --> 19:00.313
Well, technically,
it's called

19:00.356 --> 19:01.444
the Higgs-Nathanson
Reflex Test.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.577
Hey, at least
your singing was amazing.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.492
Okay. I wanna hear
more about that later.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.408
But right now, I have to go
say goodbye to Allison and...

19:08.451 --> 19:09.974
probably this directing job.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.542
God, I can't believe
we broke the dishwasher.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.240
This is so stupid.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.330
Sarah and Denise could
pick either of our spices.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.592
The kid'd turn out fine.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.072
Yeah. I mean,
we both have great kids.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.335
Yeah.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.250
I can't believe
how much you can bench.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.512
I can't believe
how much information

19:25.555 --> 19:27.427
you can store
in that brain of yours.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.168
You're like a human Google.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.474
Well, you know, Google
doesn't house information.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.388
It just kinda searches for--

19:32.432 --> 19:33.476
Yeah, no. Thank you.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.608
It's crazy,
we spent our whole lives

19:34.651 --> 19:36.392
competing
against one another.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.655
Yeah, it's like
we define ourselves

19:38.699 --> 19:40.135
against each other.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.180
Why are we like this?

19:41.223 --> 19:42.442
There they are!

19:42.485 --> 19:44.574
My big strong jock
and my boy genius.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.402
Did you guys figure out
who's the better man?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.144
Well...

19:50.145 --> 19:51.407
asked and answered.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.322
Oh, Allison.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.497
I'll see you at school.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.283
And I'm sorry again
about everything.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.414
Oh.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.415
We made a lot of money.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.461
And that's what's important.

20:01.504 --> 20:04.159
By the way, if you want
to direct the spring musical,

20:04.203 --> 20:05.639
the job's yours.
- Wait, really?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.467
Even after all that?
- Absolutely.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.338
You showed me
you can definitely handle

20:09.382 --> 20:10.557
a kids' musical.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.299
I mean, dealing
with out-of-control children,

20:13.342 --> 20:14.561
overbearing parents.

20:14.604 --> 20:16.345
Plus, I liked
how you directed

20:16.389 --> 20:18.478
your entire family
to say nice things about you.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.523
Oh, you noticed.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.655
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.310
Good night, Mr. Zarrow.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.442
Good seeing you.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.229
I'm directing
the musical!

20:33.710 --> 20:35.016
That's great.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.583
You're welcome!

20:38.411 --> 20:39.455
Hey, so what do I have to do

20:39.499 --> 20:41.414
to get Gretchen
a lead role in this play?

20:44.460 --> 20:46.984
You know, I'm not the only
performer in the family.

20:47.855 --> 20:50.074
Huh.
Do you remember what song

20:50.118 --> 20:51.511
your mom made you
audition with?

20:51.554 --> 20:52.599
Well, it was just--
it was so long ago.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.209
Yeah, and we were both
so young.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.210
Yeah.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.168

21:00.041 --> 21:02.609

21:24.283 --> 21:25.414
- Oh, yeah?
- I really am.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.415
I've never been
more embarrassed

21:26.459 --> 21:27.416
to share DNA with them.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.591
We've been
going over this all day.

21:28.635 --> 21:29.505
- Why don't you prove it?
- Okay.

21:29.549 --> 21:30.463
Okay.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.259
next to the bathroom.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.695
Thank you so much.
Ladies, hi!

21:45.739 --> 21:47.523
Can you put those
in the center of the tables?

21:47.567 --> 21:49.525
Thank you so...

21:49.569 --> 21:50.570
much.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.180
Lupe?
- Hmm?

21:52.572 --> 21:54.008
Is that how he's
arranging those?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.401
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Thank you.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.665
You're on door duty.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.016
So the goal for tonight

22:02.059 --> 22:04.279
is to impress Allison,
the head of school.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.455
Should we go over your lines
one more time

22:06.499 --> 22:07.456
before she arrives?

22:07.500 --> 22:08.370
I think we're good, right?

22:09.415 --> 22:12.592
Oh, um, wow, that Sarah
sure can handle

22:12.635 --> 22:13.767
responsibility.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.030
That Sarah
is a creative dynamo.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.337
Is there such a thing
as raising too much money?

22:18.380 --> 22:21.470
Well, I guess we'll find out
with that Sarah in charge.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.863
Very natural.
Good, I feel good.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.299
That's good.
- Oh, by the way,

22:24.343 --> 22:25.953
you can forget
about the hairy bassoonist.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.868
We have fallen
for a travel writer

22:27.911 --> 22:29.565
who speaks five languages.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.001
Oh.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.917
Two of those languages
are Dothraki and Elvish.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.005
- Dothraki?
- Yikes.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.746
Yeah.
- Mm, yeah, swipe left.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.182
I don't think
it works that way.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.663
Oh, no, it does.
- Everything does these days.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.056
It's too bad they
don't have the technology

22:42.099 --> 22:44.406
to just mash two eggs together
to make a baby.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.713
- Ooh, like a lesbian omelet.
- Gross.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.279
But yeah,
I mean, it'd be nice

22:48.323 --> 22:50.238
if we both shared DNA
with the baby.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.458
Well, some people do use
family members

22:52.501 --> 22:55.243
as donors, which we could try.

22:55.548 --> 22:58.725
That would mean Tom
or Connor stepping up.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.251
Huh.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.168
So we'd have to...

23:07.647 --> 23:08.952
Oh, sex is not involved.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.214
Okay, yeah, no sex.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.521
Yeah, obviously
sex is not involved.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.263
Wait, so--
so Tom or Connor would be

23:15.306 --> 23:17.657
the father/uncle to their

23:17.700 --> 23:19.441
son/daughter/nephew/niece.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.138
Whew, that's a lot
of slashes.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.097
Yeah, so many slashes.
Too many?

23:23.140 --> 23:24.707
I mean, it's a lot
to process.

23:24.751 --> 23:25.926
It'd be kind of...

23:26.579 --> 23:27.971
amazing.
- Complicated--amazing!

23:28.015 --> 23:29.190
- Right?
- Yes.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.496
I mean, my sperm,
Denise's egg.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.498
That kid'd be unstoppable.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.586
Totally.

23:33.629 --> 23:34.891
And that would--that would--

23:34.935 --> 23:37.590
wow, that would be
such a beautiful act.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.461
But, oh! You--

23:39.505 --> 23:40.897
Tom got a vasectomy.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.509
So no more gas in that tank.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.032
No, honey, remember?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.294
Before the procedure,
the doctor froze

23:46.337 --> 23:47.513
some samples for us,
just in case.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.950
Right. Thank you so much
for reminding all of us.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.561
Either way, that would be
a mute point,

23:52.605 --> 23:55.912
because Sarah and Denise would
obviously go with my sperm.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.697
Oh, would they?
Well, first of all,

23:57.740 --> 23:58.524
it's not a mute point.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.308
It is a moot point,

24:00.351 --> 24:02.223
which is exhibit A
as to why the superior choice

24:02.266 --> 24:04.094
would obviously be
my sperm.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.444
Can we stop using that word?

24:05.487 --> 24:07.707
Fine, because
the choice is clear.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.100
It would be me and my s--

24:11.101 --> 24:12.189
spice.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.190
My spice.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.757
Okay, guests are arriving,

24:14.801 --> 24:16.237
so can we argue
about this later

24:16.280 --> 24:17.543
or never?
- Yeah.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.651
Quite an event, Sarah.

- It's not about me, though.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.176
It's about the school.

24:42.568 --> 24:46.093
By the way, I heard
that you need a director

24:46.136 --> 24:48.269

- Yes.

24:48.312 --> 24:51.490
Sweet, dear Mrs. Agatone
is finally retiring.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.230
Well, that--that directing
job, it sounds like a--

24:53.274 --> 24:55.711
like a really exciting opportunity.

24:55.755 --> 24:57.757
That's what Mr. Zarrow
said too.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.019
- Mr. Zarrow.
- Mm-hmm.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.368
The algebra teacher?

25:00.411 --> 25:02.805
Yes, he played Tevye
in an off-Broadway

25:02.849 --> 25:04.285
production
of "Fiddler on the Roof."

25:04.328 --> 25:06.592
In fact, he's auctioning off
that fiddle tonight.

25:06.635 --> 25:07.418
Super.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.811
Super.
Cool, cool.

25:08.855 --> 25:12.641
Uh, the truth is,
I wanted to...

25:12.685 --> 25:13.642
Throw my chapeau

25:13.686 --> 25:16.689
in the ole ring-a-ding
as well.

25:16.732 --> 25:17.646
I wanted--

25:17.690 --> 25:19.213
my ring--the ring--

25:19.256 --> 25:20.127
I wanted to throw
my hat in the ring.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.694
Oh!
How fun.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.174
You know, I did some
performing back in the day.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.262
I don't know
if you're familiar

25:25.306 --> 25:26.829
with the Sacramento Playhouse?

25:26.873 --> 25:28.701
Once upon a time,
I trod the boards

25:28.744 --> 25:30.833
in a little ole show
called "Les Mis."

25:30.877 --> 25:33.749
Oh, that was a dream.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.838
Mother and daughter
in the classic tale

25:35.882 --> 25:38.188
of justice and redemption.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.757
I played Fantine,
Sarah was young Eponine.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.238
She didn't have any lines
and a wee bit of stage fright,

25:44.281 --> 25:46.762
but she really sang
the loudest.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.243
Thank you for that, Mom.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.245
Should we take a lap?
Let's take a lap.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.509
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.250
How do you feel
about the spice thing?

25:56.293 --> 25:57.817
I don't know.
It seems kinda wrong.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.688
- It's incredibly wrong.
- Thank you.

25:59.732 --> 26:00.602
I mean, how could they
even consider

26:00.646 --> 26:02.473
choosing Connor over me?
It's crazy.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.563
Right?
Of course, that.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.303
But also, um,

26:06.739 --> 26:07.783
I just don't love the idea.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.698
You'd be the father
of your sister's child.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.352
Their kid would be your kid.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.745
Where would the boundaries be?

26:12.788 --> 26:14.442
Yeah, I guess
it'd be complicated.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.488
I mean, it'd be such
an amazing gift to them.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.534
There are so many
other gifts we could get them--

26:19.578 --> 26:20.840
a gravity blanket.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.406
Oh, my God, I love those.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.539
Feels like you're getting
a warm hug.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.716
I would just hate
to disappoint her.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.631
Well, look, nothing has
to be decided tonight, okay?

26:29.675 --> 26:30.806
Just try to keep an open mind.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.547
Right,
I'll try and be supportive.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.723
So freakin' supportive.
- That's the spirit.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.899
Hey, guys. Hey!

26:37.160 --> 26:39.336
Have you said hello
to Allison yet?

26:39.380 --> 26:40.686
- Hey.
- Hi, it's good to see you.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.471
Oh, and yeah, we were just

26:43.514 --> 26:44.777
talking about you, Sarah.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.821
Weird that you...
- Oh, weird.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.431
Just walked up,
'cause I was saying that

26:47.475 --> 26:48.694
my favorite quality
about you is your...

26:49.042 --> 26:49.999
stick-to-itiveness.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.871
And I was like, "Really?

26:51.914 --> 26:54.525
'Cause for me, it's all about
her creative vision."

26:54.569 --> 26:56.789
Guys, stop it.

26:56.832 --> 26:57.659
You're embarrassing me.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.748
That's so nice
and so unexpected.

26:59.792 --> 27:00.793
Thank you.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.013
Look, of course I'd be
Sarah and Denise's choice.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.493
Look at my SAT scores.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.886
Plus, I mean,
I was on "Jeopardy!"

27:06.929 --> 27:08.452
- "Teen Jeopardy!"
- Still counts.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.845
I'm the complete package,
all right?

27:09.889 --> 27:11.847
Looks, personality.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.109
I got in early on Tesla.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.894
I got out of GE at its peak.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.678
I clearly have the better DNA.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.810
Okay.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.550
What does DNA stand for?

27:19.594 --> 27:20.987
What does DN--

27:22.815 --> 27:24.686
Definitely nice abs.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.646
Thanks, Magic Mike.
It's deoxyribonucleic acid.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.951
Let's see those abs, come on.
Whip 'em out.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.823
No, come on. I haven't worked
out lately. I was sick.

27:30.866 --> 27:31.606
You've been sick
your whole life?

27:31.650 --> 27:32.912
I'm sick of you.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.044
Are you talking about
that ridiculous donation idea?

27:35.088 --> 27:36.524
How do you know about that?

27:36.567 --> 27:37.917
Even in a crowded party,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.527
your mother homes in
on the best gossip.

27:39.570 --> 27:40.833
She hears a word
like "sperm" and,

27:40.876 --> 27:42.748
fwwt, like a bat.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.663
Spice.
We're calling it spice now.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.707
I don't care
what you call it.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.056
It's perverse.
- Well, Mom,

27:47.100 --> 27:48.928
there wouldn't be
any sex involved, okay?

27:48.971 --> 27:50.103
Denise was clear about that.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.887
Yeah, I don't think
it's an issue, sweetie.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.584
Look, Denise
isn't a blood relative.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.499
And I know
for a fact that we

27:55.543 --> 27:57.763
Hayworth men
are top-notch donors.

27:59.808 --> 28:00.809
How do you know that, Dad?

28:00.853 --> 28:02.811
Oh-ho-ho, my swimmers
have been tested.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.204
Remarkable motility.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.641
Yeah, I may be old, but...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.034
the spice can still cook.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.905
- Great. I'm never gonna...
- Gross.

28:09.949 --> 28:10.819
Stop throwing up.

28:11.951 --> 28:12.908
Hey.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.997
Oh, hey, anything good?

28:15.041 --> 28:16.042
That ski trip looked great,

28:16.085 --> 28:17.870
if you wanna take out
a 30-year loan.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.567
Hey, thanks again

28:19.610 --> 28:22.613
for being so open
to the whole spice thing.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.659
I know it was
probably like, "Whoa."

28:24.703 --> 28:27.270
"Whoa, that's awesome."

28:27.314 --> 28:28.968
- Okay.
- Yes!

28:29.011 --> 28:30.230
I mean, even though
it's a hypothetical,

28:30.273 --> 28:32.841
I'm still moved by the idea
that the baby could be

28:32.885 --> 28:34.843
genetically half me
and half Sarah.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.803
Me too.
And we really wanna help.

28:37.846 --> 28:42.024
Tom would be the father
and uncle to the same child.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.765
How many guys
can say that, huh?

28:43.809 --> 28:47.595
I'd be
the aunt/stepmother.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.991
Well, Sarah and I
would obviously be the moms.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.296
- Yes.
- But...

28:53.340 --> 28:55.995
we would want you
to play a big part.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.736
It'd be weird
if we didn't, right?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.912
I mean, we're already
such a big happy family.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.130
It'd be like that, just...

29:01.609 --> 29:02.741
times a million.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.003
Times a million.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.874
Yeah. Okay.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.355

I served a term as ♪

29:08.398 --> 29:10.226

You're a smooth operator,
aren't ya, algebra man?

29:24.110 --> 29:25.415
- Hey.
- Yeah?

29:25.459 --> 29:27.287
Uh, I know I'm the one
who brought it up.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.071
But I'm having
second thoughts

29:29.115 --> 29:30.333
about using your brothers
as donors.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.074
Just, like, second thoughts,
third thoughts,

29:32.118 --> 29:34.207
a lot of thoughts.
- Okay. It was just an idea.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.948
We haven't even
talked it through.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.080
And I don't wanna do anything
that you're uncomfortable with.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.865
Yeah, I just--

29:39.908 --> 29:41.867
I'm just worried about having
the donor so...

29:42.215 --> 29:42.955
present.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.784
But Marina is really into it.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.960
She's, like,
so freakin' supportive.

29:48.003 --> 29:48.961
But how do you tell someone
you're not sure

29:49.004 --> 29:50.179
if you wanna have
her husband's baby?

29:50.223 --> 29:51.877
Well, that sounds
like a really

29:51.920 --> 29:55.010
tough conversation that you
probably shouldn't have here.

29:55.532 --> 29:56.969
I'm sorry,
am I distracting you?

29:57.012 --> 29:58.274
Honestly, yes.
I love you so much,

29:58.318 --> 29:59.885
but right now, I'm just worried

29:59.928 --> 30:00.973
that I'm losing
this directing gig.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.888
Well. just get
onstage and sing.

30:02.931 --> 30:05.064
You're better than this guy.
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.282
I mean, he's really good.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.197
No, you're right. I am.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.069
This whole thing's so stupid.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.114
I mean, how could we prove
who's superior anyway?

30:12.158 --> 30:14.073
- There's no way to measure it.
- Yeah.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.944
Hypothetically, how can we even
figure out who's better?

30:35.007 --> 30:35.834
Two.

30:41.013 --> 30:41.970
Ooh.

30:48.498 --> 30:52.198
Come on.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.242
No, I got it! I got it.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.987
- One.
- Whoo.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.250
Now, you like math,
so let's see, I did ten.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.166
Okay, yes, you can
bench-press more than me.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.212
And you beat me
at arm wrestling

31:06.255 --> 31:07.213
even though my elbow slipped.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.388
Your elbow did not slip.

31:08.431 --> 31:10.042
But I destroyed you
at trivia.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.391
The app rated me an Einstein.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.566
What did you get?
Let's see.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.350
Oh, yeah,
"Thanks for playing."

31:14.394 --> 31:17.527
That's just the app being nice.
- So you know nerd facts.

31:17.571 --> 31:20.052
Big deal. "Oh, oh, I'm Tom.
Look at me.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.401
I know that Benjamin Franklin

31:21.444 --> 31:23.533
wasn't 'technically'
a president."

31:23.577 --> 31:24.578
Stop saying "technically."

31:24.621 --> 31:26.101
He just--he wasn't.

31:26.536 --> 31:27.233
Technically.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.192
What? Okay.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.542
Look, Sarah and Denise--
this isn't about them

31:32.586 --> 31:34.066
anymore, okay?
It's about you and me.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.545
It's about how you're always
trying to make me feel

31:35.589 --> 31:37.112
like I'm less of a man.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.940
No, it's about how you
always roll your eyes at me

31:38.984 --> 31:41.203
every time
I don't know something.

31:41.247 --> 31:41.987
Yeah, just like that.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.205
You just did it,

31:43.249 --> 31:44.511
and with the little
head shake too.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.643
The full Tom.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.298
I think you would love.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.996
It'd probably go for
a lot of money, though,

31:51.039 --> 31:52.301
so you might want
to get on that.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.130
Hey, this is
quite the fundraiser.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.045
I would even call it
a fun-raiser.

31:57.089 --> 32:01.223
So happy to support
the arts at Windmount.

32:01.267 --> 32:04.661
I'll do anything
to help out these rich kids.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.185
Oh, are you
a parent at the school?

32:06.228 --> 32:07.447
Hmm?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.144
Oh, no, I was just avoiding

32:09.188 --> 32:10.406
an awkward conversation. Sorry.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.242
Are you going
to sing tonight?

32:20.286 --> 32:22.157
I am, I think, maybe.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.290
It doesn't quite sound
like you've settled on a key.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.205
- Mom, I'm doing my best.
- Hey, I'm not criticizing.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.207
That's exactly
what you're doing.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.165
Oh, pardon me
for trying.

32:30.209 --> 32:33.125
Mother pheasant plucker
plucks mother.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.086
So how do you rank
the kids at Windmount,

32:38.130 --> 32:39.783
you know, to figure out
which one's the best?

32:39.827 --> 32:41.742
It's gotta be, like,
academic ability, right?

32:41.785 --> 32:44.092
No, no, probably,
like, a all-around thing,

32:44.136 --> 32:46.268
you know,
which kids just got it.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.010
I can assure you we would
never rank our students.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.359
- Mm.
- I know you have to say that

32:50.403 --> 32:52.579
to the parents,
but between us, come on.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.669
If this is about Gretchen,
she's doing very well.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.149
Oh, no, that's cool.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.454
But no, this is this about
him and I.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.152
- It's "him and me."
- Very good, Tom.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.631
- Damn it.
- Nice.

33:01.675 --> 33:05.287
Hey, hey.
Guys, what is happening?

33:05.331 --> 33:07.246
Allison, have you tried
the crab cakes, by the way?

33:07.289 --> 33:08.247
Because they are going
like hotcakes.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.683
So you better
go get some, girl.

33:09.726 --> 33:10.901
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.121
Head on--head on over there.
Guys?

33:13.165 --> 33:14.122
What, we're just
trying to figure out

33:14.166 --> 33:15.167
which one of us is the best.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.211
Yeah, for the spice thing.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.735
The sperm.
- Yeah, spice is sperm.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.737
I know.
Look, neither of you is better.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.131
Now, leave Allison alone, and
stop screwing up my fundraiser.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.872
- Sorry.
- Fine.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.787
If you want to be of use,
go help Lupe with the dishes.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.181
Go!

33:33.272 --> 33:34.273
Sarah said
we should help you.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.839
Oh, great...

33:36.666 --> 33:37.798
Thank you, Sarah.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.060
I can load the dishwasher.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.322
Nah, I'll do it.
I'm faster.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.628
Come on, man,
it's not about speed.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.760
Seeing how many dishes
you can load in a dishwasher

33:43.804 --> 33:45.632
is a good test
of spatial reasoning.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.549
So it's a test
of the mental and the physical.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.117
You go first. I'll time you.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.074
Let's do this.

33:55.598 --> 33:56.686
Done.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.514
- 4:16.
- Oh!

33:58.558 --> 34:00.212
A tie, really? Come on.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.604
- Best two out of three?
- Yeah.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.523
Are you taking
dirty dishes

34:07.567 --> 34:09.047
out of the dishwasher?

34:09.090 --> 34:11.397
Uh, it's complicated.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.659
Get out of my kitchen.

34:12.702 --> 34:13.834
Out, out!

34:13.877 --> 34:15.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.577
So having
a dish-loading race

34:17.620 --> 34:20.058
to see who's got
the strongest spice.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.015
No.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.365
both: Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.366
Well, there's no point
in that.

34:24.410 --> 34:25.280
There's a science to this.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.890
You know,
back when I was at MIT,

34:26.934 --> 34:28.544
my frat brothers and I
got to wondering

34:28.588 --> 34:31.199
which one of us
is the best genetic specimen.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.245
- Frat life.
- Yeah.

34:33.288 --> 34:36.857
So we came up with the
Higgs-Nathanson Reflex Test.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.033
It's a measure of both
mental and physical acuity

34:39.077 --> 34:40.382
to help you determine

34:40.426 --> 34:42.428
superior DNA.
- How's it work?

34:42.471 --> 34:45.518
Well, try to follow me here.

34:45.561 --> 34:48.216
Subject one
extends his extremities

34:48.260 --> 34:49.739
in a rigid position, like so.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.959
Subject two
extends his extremities

34:52.002 --> 34:54.701
palms up
underneath subject one's.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.269
Subject two then attempts
to make forceful contact

34:57.312 --> 35:00.098
with subject one prior
to subject one retracting.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.406
Brains, brawn,
it takes them both.

35:04.450 --> 35:07.975
- Yeah... Dad, that's slapsies.
- You say what?

35:08.018 --> 35:09.281
You just described slapsies.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.804
It's a game kids
have been playing forever.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.241
I don't think so.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.374
We got a research grant
for this.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.202
Yeah.

35:20.814 --> 35:21.858
- Oh.
- Oh.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.033
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.339
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.080
Where have you been?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.735
- Oh, just mingling.
- Yeah, me too.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.955
Funny story, I put in a bid
for the wine weekend in Napa.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.043
- Ah!
- Yeah.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.654
But I'm having
second thoughts.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.482
You know
when something seems like

35:36.525 --> 35:38.223
it's a great idea at first,
but then you think about it,

35:38.266 --> 35:40.399
and you're not so sure?

35:40.442 --> 35:41.704
Has that ever happened to you?

35:41.748 --> 35:44.403
Uh, well, not with wine.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.187
But are you having
second thoughts about

35:46.231 --> 35:48.102
the spice donor thing?

35:51.801 --> 35:53.151
No.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.979
Nope. I'm all in.
- Great. Same.

35:56.023 --> 35:58.243
Hey-o.
both: Hey-o!

35:58.286 --> 35:59.809
So I got this great app
for the kids.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.160
It combines faces, right?

36:02.203 --> 36:05.032
I mean, they usually use it
with themselves and the cat.

36:05.075 --> 36:08.688
How would you like to see
maybe Tom's and your kid?

36:08.731 --> 36:09.906
- That's okay.
- Oh, I don't think anyone

36:09.950 --> 36:10.777
wants to see that. <i></i>

36:10.820 --> 36:12.735
all: Oh.

36:12.779 --> 36:16.957
Okay. How about
Connor's and Denise's kid?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.046
- Uh, no, thanks.
- Please, no one wants this.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.265
Oy.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.876
- Oh.
- That's really bad.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.183
I paid $1.99
for this damn thing.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.404
Did you just--

36:30.144 --> 36:32.538
you just--you just said,
"No one wants this."

36:32.886 --> 36:36.150
Um, I know your heart
was set on it.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.717
And it would be
such a noble act.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.979
But I have been
thinking about it,

36:39.022 --> 36:41.634
and I'm not sure
I wanna do it.

36:41.677 --> 36:42.939
Oh, my God.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.463
Me neither.
- You don't?

36:44.506 --> 36:46.682
- No, it's a bad idea.
- It's the worst idea!

36:46.726 --> 36:48.858
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry! I love you!

36:48.902 --> 36:51.078
I love you too.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.645
I just didn't wanna hurt
your feelings.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.386
I didn't wanna hurt
your feelings.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.604
From now on,

36:55.996 --> 36:57.824
let's promise to always hurt
each other's feelings.

36:58.085 --> 36:58.912
Always.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.609
Attention, everyone.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.785
I am proud to announce
that we raised

37:02.829 --> 37:05.223
more money than ever before!

37:06.528 --> 37:08.878
Huh?
Take that, last year

37:08.922 --> 37:10.315
and every other year.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.708
And on a personal note,
I just wanna say

37:12.752 --> 37:15.233
that I have been
so inspired watching

37:15.276 --> 37:16.930

37:16.973 --> 37:19.498

38:47.325 --> 38:49.065

Look, obviously
it goes without saying

38:53.809 --> 38:55.724
that we're so sorry.

38:55.768 --> 38:56.986
Slapsies, really?

38:57.030 --> 38:58.161
Well, technically,
it's called

38:58.205 --> 38:59.511
the Higgs-Nathanson
Reflex Test.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.643
Hey, at least
your singing was amazing.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.645
Okay. I wanna hear
more about that later.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.256
But right now, I have to go
say goodbye to Allison and...

39:06.300 --> 39:07.823
probably this directing job.

39:07.867 --> 39:10.391
God, I can't believe
we broke the dishwasher.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.088
This is so stupid.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.483
Sarah and Denise could
pick either of our spices.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.441

we both have great kids.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.488

39:20.532 --> 39:22.403
I can't believe
how much you can bench.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.665
I can't believe
how much information

39:23.709 --> 39:25.275
you can store
in that brain of yours.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.016
You're like a human Google.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.323
Well, you know, Google
doesn't house information.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.237
It just kinda searches for--

39:30.280 --> 39:31.630
Yeah, no. Thank you.

39:31.673 --> 39:32.457
It's crazy,
we spent our whole lives

39:32.500 --> 39:34.241
competing
against one another.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.504
Yeah, it's like
we define ourselves

39:36.548 --> 39:37.984
against each other.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.028
Why are we like this?

39:39.072 --> 39:40.290
There they are!

39:40.334 --> 39:42.423
My big strong jock
and my boy genius.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.556
Did you guys figure out
who's the better man?

39:46.079 --> 39:46.993
Well...

39:47.994 --> 39:49.256
asked and answered.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.171
Oh, Allison.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.651
I'll see you at school.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.131
And I'm sorry again
about everything.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.263
Oh.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.569
We made a lot of money.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.614
And that's what's important.

39:59.658 --> 40:02.008
By the way, if you want
to direct the spring musical,

40:02.051 --> 40:03.488
the job's yours.
- Wait, really?

40:03.531 --> 40:05.620
Even after all that?
- Absolutely.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.492
You showed me
you can definitely handle

40:07.535 --> 40:08.406
a kids' musical.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.452
I mean, dealing
with out-of-control children,

40:11.496 --> 40:12.714
overbearing parents.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.194
Plus, I liked
how you directed

40:14.237 --> 40:16.631
your entire family
to say nice things about you.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.372
Oh, you noticed.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.504
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:21.114 --> 40:22.463
Good night, Mr. Zarrow.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.291
Good seeing you.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.077
I'm directing
the musical!

40:31.559 --> 40:32.865
That's great.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.432
You're welcome!

40:36.259 --> 40:37.609
Hey, so what do I have to do

40:37.652 --> 40:39.567

You know, I'm not the only
performer in the family.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.923
Huh.
Do you remember what song

40:47.967 --> 40:49.359
your mom made you
audition with?

40:49.403 --> 40:50.752
Well, it was just--
it was so long ago.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.058
Yeah, and we were both
so young.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.059
Yeah.
