00:04.238 --> 00:07.375
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...
All of these cases,

00:07.475 --> 00:08.676
all of these people
are related.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.379
Alan Herskovitz.
He killed Lynn Zobrist.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.980
And then he went after
Lamont Moore.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.549
<i>Lamont paid the price
for resisting someone's command.</i>

00:15.649 --> 00:17.918
<i>We found this dossier hidden
in Lamont's motel room.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:19.553
And somebody wanted him
to commit a murder.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.755
Along with...
this note.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.324
The only person
left alive on this board

00:23.424 --> 00:24.625
is Alan Herskovitz.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.827
This is all by design,

00:26.927 --> 00:29.630
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.132
<i>If we find out who killed Lamont</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:34.235
and our two bystanders,
maybe we'll figure out the rest.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.970
<i>Odds are it's the same person
behind all of it.</i>

00:37.071 --> 00:39.840
<i>Whoever it is, I've got
the feeling they're not done.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:11.105
Who's there?

01:16.009 --> 01:17.578
Reggie?

01:20.148 --> 01:22.216
Is that you?

01:29.757 --> 01:32.160
Does this feel like
a bit much, Beau?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.994
All this for
some missing food

01:34.094 --> 01:35.163
and an open window?

01:35.263 --> 01:36.464
No job is too small.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.866
I don't mind when
they call us on the B's.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.434
I'll take any crime scene
I can run.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.336
Although I got to admit
I think the culprit here

01:42.436 --> 01:44.238
is a gang of raccoons. Honey,

01:44.338 --> 01:45.773
this wasn't no raccoon.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.776
I didn't see him,
but I know it was Reggie.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.211
My late husband.

01:50.311 --> 01:54.348
He's been stealing
his favorite food all week.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.749
I'm sorry, ma'am,
did you say

01:55.849 --> 01:58.419
your dead husband
is stealing your food?

01:58.519 --> 02:00.388
That's right. Oh.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.623
I always wanted to be
a Ghostbuster.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.924
Egon?
Thanks a lot.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.326
I'm more Bill Murray than...

02:05.426 --> 02:07.027
I'm serious.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
Reggie was here.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.432
See?

02:11.532 --> 02:12.833
That's him.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.137
Don't worry, Miss Ruth.
I'll get him.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.212
Three, two, one.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.713
Go!

02:25.813 --> 02:27.114
what is it?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.150
It's a boy.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.387
My word!
How did he get in there?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.489
Hey, buddy.
Are you okay?

02:35.589 --> 02:38.259
Get an ambulance. Now.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.627
Got it.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.895
Are you okay?
Can you tell me your name?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.167
Hey, guys. Hey.

02:47.268 --> 02:51.372
So, Max said you could use
a partner on this one?

02:51.472 --> 02:52.640
How's the kid?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.575
Well, doctor says
he has complications

02:54.675 --> 02:56.477
from exposure--
dehydration, pneumonia.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.811
And he's having
an allergic reaction

02:57.911 --> 02:59.079
making his feet
and his hands peel.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.881
But I mean, other than
that, he's okay.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.985
Where are the parents?
We don't know
who they are.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.520
He's nonverbal.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.188
But child protective services
said that we can process him

03:08.289 --> 03:11.091
before bath time,
so we should get in there. Okay.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.529
There we go.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.331
Hey, pal. I'm Josh.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.867
This is Beau.
What's your name?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.637
Looks like you only got
one shoe.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.339
Do you remember where
you left the other one?

03:29.109 --> 03:30.544
Oh...

03:30.644 --> 03:32.212
So...

03:33.881 --> 03:35.048
Michael.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.584
Is that your name?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.753
It's nice to meet you, Michael.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.556
My friend Beau and I,
we have to take some pictures.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.358
We also have to get
a little bit of that dirt

03:44.458 --> 03:45.793
from under your nails.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.562
And then we need
some spit from your mouth, too.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.431
It won't hurt.
I promise.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.634
You think you could, um...

03:53.734 --> 03:56.337
Can you look up and say "ah"?

03:58.806 --> 04:00.073
Oh, you've been, uh...

04:00.173 --> 04:04.211
living in a dark
garage for about a week.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.982
A little
light sensitive.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.655
So, can you say "ah"
for me?

04:15.623 --> 04:16.924
All right.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.025
Here we go.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.593
Ready?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.209
Thanks.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.912
Can I take that bracelet
for a little while?

04:39.012 --> 04:40.247
Okay.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.016
I get it.
I totally get it.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.852
You know,

04:44.952 --> 04:46.720
I've got a daughter
about your age.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.989
And she loves
her bracelets, too.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.291
We got one just like that
for her as a souvenir.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.895
Do you know what she likes
more than bracelets?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.700
Dinosaurs.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.937
W-Would you trade
this dino for that bracelet?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.106
If I promise to return it
when I'm finished?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.680
Yeah? All right.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.583
There you go, buddy.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.152
<i>Poor kid.</i>

05:19.252 --> 05:21.489
Yeah, I tell you who's
great with him. Beau.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.657
Total teddy bear.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.293
Big brain. Bigger heart.
That's why I hired him.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.228
He's running trace.
Still got no ID on the kid.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.064
So I'm hoping
DNA gives us a hit.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.034
His only identifying characteristic

05:34.134 --> 05:36.003
is like a pointed left ear.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.871
Oh, it's probably
Stahl's deformity.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.973
It's an inherited
gene mutation

05:40.073 --> 05:41.809
that gives an extra fold
of cartilage

05:41.909 --> 05:44.645
at the ear. Wait.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.614
Your postcard.
Those scribbles.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.282
We've seen those
scribbles before.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.587
That's the same gibberish
from the postcard I found

05:53.687 --> 05:54.788
at Alan Herskovitz's apartment.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.923
<i>Silver ink.</i>

05:56.023 --> 05:58.025
<i>We found silver on the dossier</i>

05:58.125 --> 06:00.027
<i>in Lamont Moore's
bath drain, too.</i>

06:00.127 --> 06:02.630
You think whoever's ordering
these murders...

06:02.730 --> 06:04.498
sent us a thank-you card?

06:04.598 --> 06:05.733
What do you think
they're grateful for?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.701
I don't know.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.136
I better go find out.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.704
Do you want to get into
some DNA?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.473
Let's go find
the boy's family.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.113
Too much to hope
for an ID?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.516
Michael's DNA wasn't in CODIS.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.784
Must be his first B

06:23.884 --> 06:25.252
His father wasn't

06:25.352 --> 06:28.822
in the database either,
but we found his mother.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.924
Who is she?
She is a missing person

06:31.024 --> 06:32.893
by the name of
Cara Jefferson.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.262
LVPD file is pretty thin.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.664
She was 16 years old,

06:36.764 --> 06:38.165
and the detective running
the case kind of...

06:38.265 --> 06:39.567
He let it drop.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.902
The case hasn't been touched
in, like, eight years.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.837
Michael can't be
more than seven years old.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.574
That means he was born
after Cara disappeared?

06:46.674 --> 06:48.609
Cara went missing
summer of 2015.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.943
Three other girls
from her high school

06:50.043 --> 06:51.344
also disappeared that year.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.412
I know.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.714
It was a lot,
even for Vegas.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.484
But her little boy is
our new lead.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.022
What happened to you?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.295
I know the scent dogs are
supposed to help us find

07:08.395 --> 07:09.663
where Michael came from,

07:09.763 --> 07:12.332
but we're already two miles
from Miss Ruth's garage.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.702
How long can a scent dog
track a trail again?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.436
Only about 130 miles.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.872
Houses along the wash stretch
for more than seven miles.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.908
Maybe Cara's been
in Vegas all along.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.210
Not all missing persons
get very far.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.046
This is still a really long way
for Michael to walk by himself.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.681
Explains why he was so sunburnt.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.283
And the allergic reaction's
probably no question either.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.252
W-Wait, what's that?

07:32.352 --> 07:35.122
Well, where there's bee hives,
there's pollen.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.157
And where there's pollen,
there's allergens.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.693
Something made
his hands and feet peel.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.228
Just got off the phone
with my captain.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.763
Michael's grandparents
are local.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.932
Mary and Pete. Cara's stepdad.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.535
They're coming home
early from vacation.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.802
On their way
to the hospital now.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.470
Well, that's a hell
of a surprise.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.439
"Congratulations,
you're grandparents."
Yeah.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.341
I mean, there was no mention of
Cara being pregnant

07:54.441 --> 07:55.976
in the old file.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.545
Mary did say
she always suspected

07:57.645 --> 07:58.846
Cara's high school boyfriend

07:58.946 --> 08:00.213
being responsible for
her running away.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.616
Name is Sam Daley.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.318
Hold on. Running away?
I thought she disappeared.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.020
That's how it was
initially reported,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.389
but a week later,
Mom got a letter from Cara.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.858
"I'm never coming back."

08:10.958 --> 08:12.960
Well, whether she ran away
or she was abducted,

08:13.060 --> 08:14.361
she's still missing.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.896
Yeah.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.200
<i>Over here.</i>

08:29.442 --> 08:32.145
Wait a minute.
I got something.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.219
Oh, it's Cara.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.188
Looks like she's been
here about a week.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.656
She's wrapped in a blanket.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.991
Yeah, she was probably killed
somewhere else.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.392
This is just a dump site.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.827
If Cara

08:46.927 --> 08:48.095
and the other missing girls
from her high school

08:48.195 --> 08:49.763
were taken by the same person...

08:49.863 --> 08:51.364
They could be buried
out here, too.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.902
The beehives I saw earlier
might help us find them.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.138
I'll explain later.
But may I?

08:58.238 --> 09:02.209
Yeah, of course.
Maybe-maybe take a uni to help.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.277
If the scent dogs followed
Michael's trail

09:04.377 --> 09:07.314
to Cara's grave,
does that mean...?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.885
Michael's shoe.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.622
He...

09:14.722 --> 09:16.356
He was buried alive.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.968

09:56.363 --> 09:57.564
She was buried alive, too?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.600
The autopsy will determine
how-how she died.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.135
Has the boy talked about

10:02.235 --> 10:04.371
what happened to him,
what happened to his mommy?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.339
No, no, he hasn't
said anything.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.841
Is he mute?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.609
No.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.312
No, he's just been through
a real trauma.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.347
Poor kid.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.784
Mm.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.853
You know, uh, the time for
questions is later.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.221
Please, you have a grandson.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.991
Go and meet him.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.930
You know, I saw some Jays' Chips
in the vending machine.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.431
Want some?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.002
Sure.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.411
Well, damn. Somebody
must have got them.

10:44.511 --> 10:48.381
So, uh, how you holding up?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.084
Oh, um...
I'm-I'm doing great.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.924
I have daughters Michael's age.
Mm-hmm.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.793
If something like this
ever happened to them, I--

10:59.893 --> 11:00.961
And no matter how hard
it is for you,

11:01.061 --> 11:02.362
it's worse
for the families.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.563
I know.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.232
And your feelings
matter here,

11:05.332 --> 11:07.067
but you got to learn to
distance yourself from them.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.103
For your sanity.
For their confidence.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.205
I am happy to walk away
from this case.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.075
I am not dismissing you
from this case, Beau.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.509
This is a big deal, Max.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.578
Don't you think you need
a real pro, like Allie

11:18.678 --> 11:20.280
or Catherine?
Or you.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.249
You're a pro, right?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.686
You've got this, Beau.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
Okay, boss.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.428
Cara suffered major central
nervous system injury.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.596
See?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.631
The gray matter is thin,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.934
tissue is softening,
and there's loss

11:41.034 --> 11:42.836
at the gray-white junction.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.205
These are all signs of laminar
necrosis caused by hypoxemia.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.940
So she suffocated. Well...

11:47.040 --> 11:48.708
Not how you're thinking of it.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.411
Hypoxemia can be caused by
a myriad of complications.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.946
Each has their own
set of clues--

11:53.046 --> 11:54.547
pulmonary embolism
or edema,

11:54.647 --> 11:56.449
pneumothorax,
narcotic overdose...

11:56.549 --> 11:57.584
Being buried alive?

11:57.684 --> 11:59.486
Possibly...

11:59.586 --> 12:01.254
I did find
trace of fiber

12:01.354 --> 12:04.257
and dirt in her mouth
and throat, but not her lungs.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.326
So, she didn't
suffocate on dirt?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
Well, it's possible
the dirt may have given her

12:08.228 --> 12:09.362
a laryngospasm.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.698
So during times of
extreme distress,

12:11.799 --> 12:13.233
<i>like being buried alive,</i>

12:13.333 --> 12:15.568
<i>the vocal chords can
involuntarily contract</i>

12:15.668 --> 12:17.971
<i>to block foreign bodies from
entering the trachea.</i>

12:18.071 --> 12:20.340
The larynx will
remain constricted

12:20.440 --> 12:21.541
to the point of suffocation,

12:21.641 --> 12:23.576
leaving no trace in the lungs.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.945
You don't sound convinced.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.579
Well, that's because I'm not.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.315
Laryngeal spasms are undetectable.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.617
The only way to confirm
is to rule out all other

12:30.717 --> 12:33.854
possible causes of hypoxemia
from my list first.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.758
I'm sorry,
there is something else.

12:40.227 --> 12:45.098
I have found old scar tissue
in Cara's vaginal canal.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.166
Cara was raped.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.734
Yes.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.704
Many times, over the span
of years, I think.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.274
And she had
an enlarged uterus.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.844
So that suggests that she'd
recently given birth.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.245
How long ago?

12:58.345 --> 12:59.612
No less than three months.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.549
That along with her skin pallor,

13:02.649 --> 13:05.785
her weak bones,
her low muscle tone...

13:05.886 --> 13:09.556
I have reason to believe
that Cara was held captive.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.058
For years.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.692
The goodbye letter that
she wrote to her parents,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.594
I mean, that can't be real. Sonya,

13:14.694 --> 13:17.898
I need a sample of
the dirt from Cara's throat.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.732
Yes, I already bagged
some of it for you.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.668
Thank you. Joshua,

13:21.768 --> 13:26.439
we need Cara's letter
to her parents from LVPD.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.041
It could give us answers

13:28.141 --> 13:30.477
about who kept Cara captive
and where they kept her.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.013
Thank you, please.
Got it, boss.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.779
Raman spectroscopy.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.882
It's right up there
with coffee ice cream.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.383
It's damn near perfect.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.219
Gives you all the facts,
but leaves your evidence intact.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.056
Yeah, except our silver ink
sources aren't very instructive.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.457
The postcards are
covered in prints

14:17.557 --> 14:18.825
from mail sorting,

14:18.926 --> 14:22.095
so I have been focusing
on ink instead.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.398
Right, find the ink, find the
architect of all this madness?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.866
Yeah, that'd be nice.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.769
Herskovitz's card uses
a common oil-based ink.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.539
But our thank-you card
is written in

14:32.639 --> 14:34.641
silver nanoparticle ink.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.842
It's pretty standard.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.410
I... have never heard of it.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.013
It's a conductive ink used
in circuit board creation.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.316
The writing on both postcards
uses an unknown alphabet.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.418
The language is
an unhinged original.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.854
The writing's also
consistent and deliberate.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.457
The author may be unhinged,
but he's smart.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.292
Unhinged and smart.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.363
That fits every killer
and victim in this case.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.564
Oh. W-What's going on?

14:57.664 --> 15:00.033
The boxes are full of
honey, not bees.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.102
I just need
someplace to put it,

15:02.202 --> 15:03.937
while I set up my experiment.
Is it okay if I...

15:04.037 --> 15:05.939
Make yourself at home, honey.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.507
Nice.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.310
I think the honey can tell us
if the other high school girls

15:10.410 --> 15:12.512
who went missing when Cara did
are buried nearby.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.215
Extracting volatile
organic compounds from honey

15:15.315 --> 15:17.250
to detect the presence
of humans.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.218
Exactly.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.487
Outside.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.990
Go. Now.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.432
Beau.
Hey.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.534
You know, that trace
we found in Cara's throat,

15:34.634 --> 15:35.735
it's the same stuff
that we found

15:35.835 --> 15:36.836
under Michael's nails.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
It's a mixture of
volcanic rock,

15:38.038 --> 15:39.506
melamine, ferrous ore.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.907
Not exactly what you'd expect
to see in the Mojave.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.442
No. Not at all.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.943
I mean, I'm comparing it to
other known soil compositions.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.278
Do you have the letter?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.514
Yeah, if Cara was
taken and held captive,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.150
there's a good chance that
her captor wrote it for her.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.919
But problem is, the perp's
prints will be eight years old.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.321
Well, and they would be
buried too

15:54.421 --> 15:57.157
under prints from Cara's
family, mail carriers,

15:57.257 --> 15:58.758
LVPD detectives.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.394
It sure looks like the writing
of a 16-year-old girl to me.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.663
Yeah.
Who could do
something like this?

16:03.763 --> 16:04.998
We're gonna find out.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.267
You ever heard of
the 1/2-indanedione process?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.735
Mm-mm.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.869
Ooh, buddy.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.141
<i>So amino acids dig out
the latent fingerprints</i>

16:14.241 --> 16:15.542
<i>absorbed by the paper.</i>

16:15.642 --> 16:17.444
<i>But the only way to see
the old prints</i>

16:17.544 --> 16:20.913
<i>under the ones on top is to find
the correct light frequency.</i>

16:34.227 --> 16:35.895
Bingo.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.564
<i>The prints on the bottom</i>

16:37.664 --> 16:39.099
are definitely Cara's.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.301
So, she did write
the letter?
Maybe.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.770
Or maybe it was just
her stationery.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.205
Also got a
second set of prints.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.841
Well, only partials really,
but they're just as old.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.777
And AFIS...

16:50.877 --> 16:53.446
says they belong to
Samuel Daley.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.448
That's Cara's high school boyfriend.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.050
Looks like his prints are
in the system

16:57.150 --> 16:58.885
from a shoplifting arrest
as a teenager.

16:58.985 --> 17:02.189
Not much of a record, but...

17:02.289 --> 17:05.292
Look where he lives.
Right next to where
we found Cara.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.633
I didn't kidnap Cara.
I never hurt her.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.768
And I most definitely
did not kill her.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.870
Your fingerprints are all over
her goodbye letter, Sam.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.039
And Cara's parents seem to think
that she was your girlfriend.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.909
Okay, trust me.
She was my friend.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.777
You don't need a DNA
test to prove it.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.279
I spoke
to your former classmates.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.281
You were popular with
the ladies in high school.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.782
And some of those girls
went missing

17:29.882 --> 17:31.784
the exact same summer
that Cara did.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.621
Cara and I only
pretended to date.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.727
I was a gay kid from
a crazy religious household.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.629
She helped me fly
under the radar.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.099
We protected each other.
What did you protect
Cara from?

17:47.900 --> 17:51.070
Cara had a boyfriend she didn't
want her parents to know about.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.173
And you never shared this
information with her parents.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.741
He was an older guy.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.709
That's all she
would tell me.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.179
I helped Cara send that
letter to her parents.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.181
And then...

18:01.281 --> 18:02.849
she was gone.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.554
Cara kept my secret
and I wanted to keep hers.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.088
You can believe me or not,

18:09.189 --> 18:10.590
but...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.526
No.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.927
We can test you.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.264
I need your DNA, Sam.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.898
Okay.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.936
Cara's kid?

18:25.138 --> 18:26.473
How's he doing?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.410
So, Cara had a secret boyfriend?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.312
If Sam is
telling the truth,

18:32.412 --> 18:35.315
and his DNA here may
determine that.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.217
How's the silver ink case going?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.718
It's tough.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.420
I don't want another lead
if the only way to get one

18:40.520 --> 18:42.255
is for another body
to drop.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.023
We just keep hitting dead ends.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.426
Dead ends redirect you
towards the truth.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.228
Right?
Mm-hmm.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.897
All right. Good news.
Family services called.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.099
Michael's been cleared by his
child psychiatrist to go home.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.267
Good.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.935
Child psychiatrist?
Yeah.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.705
Of course.
Smart and unstable.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.040
Lamont Moore,
Lynn Zobrist, and her killer

19:01.140 --> 19:02.942
all shared the same
child psychiatrist.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.977
Maybe the other victims
had psychiatrists, too.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.979
There you go.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.256
Well...

19:16.356 --> 19:19.559
our lead suspect, Sam Daley,
is not Michael's father.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.394
Just like he said.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.330
Got a little dead end of
our own, don't we, Beau?
Maybe not.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.333
What if we search Cara's things
at her mom's house?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.901
She might have kept a diary
about a secret boyfriend.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.071
Mm-hmm. Go and get
after it, Mr. Finado. Okay.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.607
These symbols...

19:34.707 --> 19:37.610
Reminds me of
The Voynich Manuscripts.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.812
It's this ancient European book.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.750
The author invented
his own language.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.252
Probably.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.187
It's inspired schizophrenics
for centuries.

19:48.288 --> 19:52.725
So, you think that the person
who sent these cards,

19:52.825 --> 19:55.995
they're responsible for
my patient's death?

19:56.095 --> 19:57.330
Thank you.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.066
Lynn Zobrist and another
victim, Lamont Moore,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.034
and the man who killed
Lynn too, they all had

20:02.134 --> 20:05.071
<i>scars on their temples from
electroconvulsive therapy.</i>

20:05.171 --> 20:06.873
We're looking at
a larger pattern now,

20:06.973 --> 20:08.641
and it got me thinking,

20:08.741 --> 20:11.244
maybe the other victims
suffered some serious

20:11.344 --> 20:12.445
psychiatric problems, too.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.913
Maybe there's
a common thread.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.415
It says on your website

20:15.515 --> 20:17.317
that you're involved with
the state licensing board.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.019
We thought you might be able to
help us find these records?

20:20.119 --> 20:22.755
These people are deceased?
Yes.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.324
I can certainly try.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.158
Oh, Dr. Auerbach, before you go,

20:26.259 --> 20:28.561
I'm just wondering--
this whole web of death,

20:28.661 --> 20:32.198
these assignment killings,
why do you think it's happening?

20:32.299 --> 20:34.033
Could it be a game?

20:34.133 --> 20:38.204
Antisocial personalities
sometimes find

20:38.305 --> 20:41.641
amusement in what more
socialized personalities

20:41.741 --> 20:45.678
would find macabre or taboo.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.714
More will be revealed.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.783
Okay.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.559
<i>Mary,</i>

20:59.659 --> 21:01.361
Michael, we have guests.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.297
Hey, bud. Hey.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.798
We have reason to believe
Cara may have been

21:05.898 --> 21:07.300
close to a man you
didn't know about.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.568
We were hoping that we could

21:08.668 --> 21:10.370
take a look at
some of her things.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.939
Excuse me.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.944
Um, Cara doesn't have
a room anymore.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.879
It was too difficult
living with so many

21:19.979 --> 21:22.749
memories of her
after she disappeared.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.185
The past eight years for Mary
have been hell.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.755
The only time she's herself
is when I send her on her trips.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.357
Caribbean,

21:30.457 --> 21:31.891
Latin America, Africa,

21:31.991 --> 21:33.960
Asia.
Mm-hmm.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.863
Wow. You guys
have been everywhere.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.398
Mary loves to travel.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.601
Always took her mind off of...

21:41.701 --> 21:42.835
You know.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.037
Uh, Cara's boxes
are in the basement

21:45.137 --> 21:46.439
if you want to take a look.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.640
Thanks.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.242
Do you mind if I stay
with him?

21:50.343 --> 21:51.744
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.346
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.284
Hey, Michael.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
How you been, huh?

22:01.754 --> 22:04.023
You, uh...

22:04.123 --> 22:06.258
I mean, how do you like
your new home?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.567
Whoops!

22:19.572 --> 22:20.740
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, buddy, here.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.908
Here, have some water. Whoa.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.410
Buddy, hey, it's okay.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.711
It's okay.
We'll clean it up.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.413
It's just water.
It's okay.
Hey. Hey.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.781
We'll clean it up.
It's okay, baby.
Come with Gammy.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.917
We'll watch some TV.
We'll clean this up later.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.953
Uh, Micha--
Come on.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.922
Usually we'd try to
extract honey proteins

22:36.022 --> 22:38.124
using polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.259
But we need GC/MS
in order to separate

22:40.359 --> 22:42.962
the volatile organic compounds
from the honey proteins so...

22:43.062 --> 22:46.533
Penny. I've only read one
journal article about this.

22:46.633 --> 22:47.700
So just slow it down?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.002
A touch?
Sorry.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.072
<i>When humans decompose,
we release volatile</i>

22:53.172 --> 22:56.242
<i>organic compounds
into the soil around us.</i>

22:56.342 --> 23:00.179
<i>Those volatile organic compounds
are then absorbed by vegetation</i>

23:00.279 --> 23:02.081
<i>near the body as nutrients</i>

23:02.181 --> 23:05.785
<i>and then deposited
into the pollen.</i>

23:05.885 --> 23:09.422
<i>The bee then takes that pollen
and turns it into honey,</i>

23:09.522 --> 23:12.358
<i>preserving the VOCs
in the process.</i>

23:12.459 --> 23:15.762
So if there are VOCs
in the honey sample,

23:15.862 --> 23:17.964
we know to look for cadavers

23:18.064 --> 23:19.999
near the corresponding
pollen sources.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.001
Theoretically,
bees can do in a few hours

23:22.101 --> 23:23.970
something it takes
cadaver dogs

23:24.070 --> 23:26.272
weeks to pinpoint.
Mm-hmm.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.642
But don't all organic
things release VOCs

23:29.742 --> 23:31.177
when they decompose?
Yes.

23:31.277 --> 23:35.014
But humans have five unique
esters we'll be looking for--

23:35.114 --> 23:36.549
3-Methylbutyl pentanoate,

23:36.649 --> 23:37.817
propyl hexan--

23:37.917 --> 23:40.152
You get it.
Let's get this into GC/MS.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.360
There are more bodies
in the riverbed, aren't there?

23:48.461 --> 23:51.230
Now we just need to find out
where they're hiding.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.636
The basement's kind of a letdown
compared to the house, right?

23:56.736 --> 23:57.970
Yeah.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.039
Wh-What's with the boxes?
Moisture damage.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.709
If we do find anything,
it'll be compromised by mold.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.043
Not ideal.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.212
I'm gonna go talk to
Pete and Mary.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.346
I'll tag you in.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.715
Thanks.
See you guys up there.

24:08.815 --> 24:09.716
All right.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.784
How'd it go with Michael?

24:11.884 --> 24:13.953
I mean,
I made him laugh,

24:14.053 --> 24:16.388
and then he just...
just exploded.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.458
Oh. Got to take the good
with the bad, you know?

24:19.559 --> 24:21.961
Dealing with victims,
their families,

24:22.061 --> 24:23.663
it's-it's tough.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.866
But you know,
it's fuel too, right?

24:30.169 --> 24:33.139
Beau, that's why we do it.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.141
Help people.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.442
Look.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.410
I've been a problem solver
my whole life.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.180
I just, I wanted to solve more
meaningful ones than...

24:41.280 --> 24:43.049
how you make a kitchen
sponge cheaper

24:43.149 --> 24:44.984
so some corporation's stock
would go up.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.319
I mean, don't get me wrong.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.189
I want justice
for the victims. I do.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.758
I just...

24:51.858 --> 24:54.426
I don't know if I can use
the victims as fuel that way.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.899
Cara liked dinosaurs, too.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.234
Just like my girls.

25:04.637 --> 25:07.506
I'm going to, uh... I'm gonna
go check the other room.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.853
I got that one for The Bible
as read by Charlton Heston.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.522
Wow.
You're recording royalty.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.891
I wouldn't say that.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.059
Just, you know,
Mr. Audiobook.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.095
Here's more of
Cara's stuff.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.863
Best vocalist,
age group 10 to 13.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.665
Cara was a singer?
A beautiful singer.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.400
That's how I met Mary.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.235
She wanted me to record
a demo of Cara

25:36.335 --> 25:38.605
when she was ten years old,
make her a star.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.972
But you're the audiobook guy.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.274
No one sets out
to be the audiobook guy.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.810
Sure.
Hey, Beau.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.578
I found Cara's yearbook.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.980
English teacher was
her favorite. Look.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.349
My physics teacher was always
my favorite teacher.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.518
No, no.
Look at the picture.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.320
His ear.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.689
He's got Stahl's deformity.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.459
He's mine.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.294
Michael is mine.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.767
Cara told me she was pregnant
before she disappeared.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.268
We were in love.
So, you think

26:09.368 --> 26:12.171
'cause it's love
it's not statutory rape?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.674
The age of consent
in Nevada is 16.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.175
And I was only 23 at the time.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.444
You've practiced that line
in the mirror.

26:18.544 --> 26:21.380
I wonder how he's gonna
explain kidnapping

26:21.480 --> 26:24.116
and sexual assault
charges?
Wh-What kidnapping?

26:24.216 --> 26:26.919
A few other students
at your school went missing

26:27.019 --> 26:29.055
that same summer.
Where are they, Jake?

26:29.155 --> 26:31.658
I'm not the kind of guy
who kidnaps

26:31.758 --> 26:32.959
and rapes girls.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.994
I have a wife and children.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.966
Does your wife know about Cara?

26:40.066 --> 26:42.935
How she was held
prisoner for years,

26:43.035 --> 26:46.538
forced to give birth
with no medical care.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.176
Come on, Jake.
Where's the baby?

26:50.276 --> 26:54.681
We were gonna run away together.
But she never showed.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.918
I don't know where she went,
but I didn't do any of...

26:59.018 --> 27:00.987
that to her, so...

27:02.188 --> 27:05.391
I want a lawyer.
You're gonna need one.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.002
I think that's it, Penny.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.636
No, no, there's one more spot.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.839
The Mojave Wild Flower
Society says

27:19.939 --> 27:21.440
there's a few more
poppies over here.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.509
Just give me
a few more minutes.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.046
I don't see any flowers.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.150
Detectives! Over here.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.387
Okay, boy.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.348
I don't think
we're searching for

28:02.448 --> 28:04.884
missing high school
girls after all.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.061
That's Cara's baby.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.607
Infant is a preemie girl,
around 30 weeks.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.709
She died approximately
three months ago

28:30.810 --> 28:32.544
due to what I would sum up
as medical negligence.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.514
Of course. Jake Rooney couldn't
take her to the hospital.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.083
Let's wait
for some results

28:37.183 --> 28:38.317
before we jump to
conclusions, Beau.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.786
Sorry, boss.

28:39.886 --> 28:40.787
It's just you should've heard
Michael's cough

28:40.887 --> 28:42.088
the last time I saw him.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.222
His peeling hands were
driving him nuts.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.723
What did you say?

28:44.824 --> 28:47.927
Michael's hands
and his feet are peeling.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.800
But there was nothing
in her stomach.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.576
Yeah.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.712
Do you need help?
Yep.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.481
Well, that's nice.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.784
Okay.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.022
Okay.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.962
Huh. Yeah.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.731
There you are.
Look at that.

29:25.832 --> 29:29.101
Diatoms.
Yup. Diatoms.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.604
Diatoms in the inner ear
mean that Cara was submerged

29:32.704 --> 29:34.340
underwater before she died.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.842
Cara drowned to death?

29:35.942 --> 29:38.444
No. No, in order to
drown to death, you have to

29:38.544 --> 29:39.778
take water
into your lungs.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.613
Cara nearly drowned.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.283
<i>I believe that she suffocated
due to mammalian dive reflex.</i>

29:44.383 --> 29:47.253
<i>It's a physiological response
to being submerged</i>

29:47.353 --> 29:49.055
<i>in cold water,
and one of the side effects</i>

29:49.155 --> 29:51.657
<i>is the involuntarily
contraction of the throat.</i>

29:51.757 --> 29:53.359
<i>A laryngeal spasm.</i>

29:53.459 --> 29:56.495
I put drowning at the
bottom of the list

29:56.595 --> 29:57.830
of potential causes of death

29:57.930 --> 29:59.365
because she had no other
signs of drowning.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.968
There was no water in her
lungs or her stomach.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.570
But her son had pneumonia
and his hands were peeling.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.272
Yeah. Both signs of
near drowning.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.608
The question is, where did
they both go underwater?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.777
The only person
who knows is Michael.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.849
You were right.
Every person on that list

30:16.949 --> 30:19.685
has a psychiatric file
with the state.

30:19.785 --> 30:21.220
Some with Dr. Sarkisian.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.023
Dr. Sarkisian is dead,
right?
He is.

30:24.123 --> 30:29.128
He specialized in schizophrenia,
borderline personality disorder.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.296
Tough cases.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.663
Most of the files
are in there.

30:31.763 --> 30:32.932
Sorry, most?

30:33.032 --> 30:35.034
Actually, some of mine
are missing.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.835
I think I might
have been robbed.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.071
Really? Will you show me?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.873
Well...

30:40.973 --> 30:43.242
This is where I keep
all my old records.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.178
Some, you know,
past patients. Yeah.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.180
The locks don't look compromised.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.816
The files could've been
taken ten years ago.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.952
There's all kinds of
ancient history.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.887
No kidding.
Carbon copies?

30:54.987 --> 30:56.855
Ha, it's how we used to

30:56.956 --> 31:01.060
provide the state with
copies of observations...

31:01.160 --> 31:02.962
I'd like to call some
colleagues down here,

31:03.062 --> 31:04.997
to process this as
a potential crime scene.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.933
Mm-hmm.
If someone took
the files,

31:07.033 --> 31:09.401
that could be the person
we're looking for.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.203
Oh, God. I, um...

31:11.303 --> 31:13.039
I've got to get to the airport.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.908
I'm-- I have a speaking
engagement in Saskatoon.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.576
I know. Glamorous. Yeah.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.379
Um, okay.
I'll tell you what.

31:20.479 --> 31:25.017
Um, I will have my secretary
take out any active files,

31:25.117 --> 31:27.419
but then it's all yours.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.454
Thank you.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.258
<i>This is my friend Serena.</i>

31:32.358 --> 31:34.360
Hi.
Do you mind if we ask
some questions

31:34.460 --> 31:36.162
about your mommy?
He won't even talk to us.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.563
Why would he talk to you?
Mary...

31:37.663 --> 31:40.099
It's okay.
It's all right.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.868
Do you remember the last time
you saw your mommy?

31:44.336 --> 31:46.372
It's okay to tell Beau, sweetie.

31:46.472 --> 31:47.739
You're safe.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.275
Do you remember
the last time I saw you?

31:49.375 --> 31:51.477
And that-that water
spilled on you...

31:52.844 --> 31:54.513
Was it because water scares you?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.355
You want to play?

32:06.258 --> 32:07.459
I, uh...

32:09.195 --> 32:10.896
I saw something downstairs
that I think Michael would like.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.298
Do you mind?

32:12.398 --> 32:14.166
Yeah. Go for it.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.406
There you are.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.280
It's all corroded.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.393
Mold.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.101
None here.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.039
That's weird.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.586
Hello!

33:13.559 --> 33:15.461
Well, thank goodness.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.351
Hello?

34:17.223 --> 34:19.425
So what? There's an
apartment in my basement.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.726
What exactly
are you implying?

34:20.826 --> 34:22.194
Sir, we can have
that conversation

34:22.294 --> 34:23.695
once we finish searching.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.031
There's no window.
There's only one way in and out.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.733
That ain't healthy.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.736
How did you even know
this space was here?
I didn't.

34:30.836 --> 34:31.937
This little guy tipped me off.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.539
Corroded battery. Water damage.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.873
And Cara nearly drowned.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.608
Lots of basements
have dehumidifiers,

34:36.708 --> 34:38.444
but other than Cara's boxes,
there was no mold.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.513
Someone did some cleanup.
Or more like a full-scale
remediation.

34:41.613 --> 34:42.681
See this pipe up here?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.583
New fitting there.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.185
That's been recently replaced.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.019
You can tell by the sealant
on the edges of the joint.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.522
How could this room fill up with
enough water to drown an adult?

34:50.622 --> 34:51.923
Well, that door was like
opening a bank vault.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.559
You think she lived down here?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.093
I mean, if you call
what Pete did to her living.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.963
You don't think that he...
In front of the kid?

34:58.063 --> 34:59.931
Michael hasn't shown
any fear of Pete.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.468
I think she tried to protect
her little boy when Pete,

35:02.568 --> 35:03.635
you know, visited.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.970
Hid him in the bathroom.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.705
I mean, Michael has
no idea who he is.

35:06.805 --> 35:10.041
Yeah, but so this space isn't
enough room for him to keep

35:10.142 --> 35:12.811
multiple girls.
Oh, I think he probably
used the missing

35:12.911 --> 35:14.646
high school girls as cover
for taking Cara.

35:14.746 --> 35:15.914
Problem is,
we still don't have any proof

35:16.014 --> 35:18.417
that Cara was
ever down here.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.152
Well, let's find it.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.735
How?

35:36.835 --> 35:38.670
How did he get this damn room
so frigging clean?

35:38.770 --> 35:40.472
Hey, hey.
Hang in there, Beau.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.640
Let's just take
a beat, okay?

35:41.740 --> 35:44.576
Get quiet.
Let's just reassess.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.649
Or...

35:50.749 --> 35:52.984
Or just lose it.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.054
What the hell are you doing?!

35:56.154 --> 35:58.457
Most people use the pink
fiberglass for insulation.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.091
This is soundproof.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.293
I'm a sound guy!

36:01.393 --> 36:02.328
Of course I insulate!

36:02.428 --> 36:03.629
Take a step back.
Cool off.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.563
You know what
soundproof insulation

36:04.663 --> 36:05.831
is made of? Rockwool.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.899
Who cares?
Rockwool is made of basalt,

36:07.999 --> 36:10.636
melamine and slag,
also known as ferrous ore.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.271
Same trace we found in
Cara's throat

36:12.371 --> 36:13.772
and under Michael's nails.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.643
<i>The water main
to the house burst</i>

36:17.743 --> 36:20.279
<i>while Cara and Michael were
trapped inside this room.</i>

36:20.379 --> 36:23.148
<i>Nobody could hear her scream</i>

36:23.249 --> 36:25.684
<i>because the room was soundproofed.</i>

36:25.784 --> 36:27.919
<i>And then Cara and Michael</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:31.523
<i>tried to claw their way
out of the room.</i>

36:31.623 --> 36:33.225
Mommy!

36:36.862 --> 36:40.699
You must've found Cara
shortly after she died.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.401
You thought
Michael was dead.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.336
<i>So you buried him</i>

36:44.436 --> 36:46.004
<i>with his mother.</i>

36:48.740 --> 36:50.141
What?

36:51.076 --> 36:54.446
About four months ago,
Cara came back home.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.181
I hadn't seen her
in eight years.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.250
She had Michael now,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.486
and she was pregnant again,
begging for money.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.854
Why didn't you tell me?

37:02.954 --> 37:04.723
She said she was gonna
give her baby away.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.224
Just needed
a place to stay, so...

37:06.325 --> 37:08.226
I gave her the apartment
while you were out of town.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.928
I kept them down there
to keep them safe.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.331
I thought she'd--
You-- What?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.632
The water pipe,

37:13.732 --> 37:15.834
the drowning,
it was all an accident...

37:15.934 --> 37:17.035
Stop.
No...

37:17.135 --> 37:18.404
Shut up!

37:18.504 --> 37:21.340
We found Cara's baby
she was gonna give away

37:21.440 --> 37:24.543
in the same field you buried
Cara and Michael.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.111
Here's what's
interesting, Pete.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.980
We ran that baby's DNA

37:29.080 --> 37:30.749
against yours.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.884
You're a match.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.887
What did you do?

37:35.987 --> 37:37.222
You want to run
that story back for us?

37:37.323 --> 37:39.725
Cara didn't run away.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.560
You locked her away.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.961
You stole her life.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.730
You abused her for eight years
in that basement...

37:44.830 --> 37:45.997
Stand up.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.999
I'm not who you think I am.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.168
I-I couldn't let her leave.
I loved Cara.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.338
I loved her.
No, what you did
wasn't love.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.406
Up. Now.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.009
I'm not buying it.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.845
How could Mary not know
what Pete was doing

37:59.945 --> 38:01.212
for eight whole years?

38:01.313 --> 38:03.815
Every family secret
is built on denial.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.017
If you don't see it,
you don't have to face it.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.119
Something about Mary
that isn't right.

38:08.219 --> 38:11.089
She spent the past eight years
of her life on vacation.

38:11.189 --> 38:14.493
Ain't nothing right
about that.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.961
That's right.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.162
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

38:17.262 --> 38:19.831
I wasn't charged with anything.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.733
He's my grandson.
Ma'am.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.234
He may be returned
to your custody

38:23.335 --> 38:25.070
once family court
determines fitness.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.138
But not yet.
Not ever.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.275
Haven't
you two done enough?

38:30.376 --> 38:31.877
I think you knew
what your husband was doing

38:31.977 --> 38:33.111
in the basement
all those years.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.046
I did not know.
How would I know?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.615
When I first met Michael,
he was wearing this.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.149
I knew I'd seen it before.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.719
I got one for my daughters
as a souvenir.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.020
It's a Mexican woven bracelet.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.389
You bought this for Michael

38:43.489 --> 38:44.523
while you were on vacation,
right, Mary?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.458
Uh... Maybe Pete did.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.193
But Pete's not in any
of your vacation photos.

38:48.293 --> 38:51.129
<i>And his passport expired
years ago, I checked.</i>

38:51.229 --> 38:53.264
Pete doesn't go on your trips
around the world with you,

38:53.365 --> 38:55.266
does he, Mary?

38:57.002 --> 38:59.137
Pete married me,
but he loved Cara.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.006
What else was I supposed to do?

39:01.106 --> 39:02.974
Leave.
Like Cara tried to.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.476
And go back to my old life?

39:04.576 --> 39:06.011
She wouldn't have
lasted out there

39:06.111 --> 39:07.946
on her own for a week.
That girl was useless.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.280
She was bound
for trouble.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.683
If Pete wanted her,
he could have her.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.084
Hands behind your back.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.921
You traded your daughter
for cruises and spa days.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.656
She liked the attention.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.992
Beau, please, that's mine.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.764
I knew he would like
that bracelet.
Let's go.

39:41.379 --> 39:45.383
Dr. Auerbach was right.
Some of these are really old.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.386
This carbon paper is almost
impossible to read.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.088
All right, hang on.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.424
Are those doodles
on the carbon paper?

39:52.524 --> 39:53.559
What else would they be?

39:53.659 --> 39:54.893
I don't know.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.363
Proof that Dr. Auerbach
has some secrets?

40:02.167 --> 40:03.435
I don't know what
any of this means.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.903
But didn't she say

40:05.003 --> 40:07.038
whoever's behind this
might be playing games?

40:07.138 --> 40:09.441
Mm-hmm.
Maybe that's exactly
what she's doing.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.744
How long is Dr. Auerbach
out of town again?

40:12.844 --> 40:13.979
I'm gonna find out.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.814
When she gets back to Vegas,

40:15.914 --> 40:18.917
she's gonna answer
some hard questions.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.921
Hey!
Hey.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.057
So I got a little
good news for you.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.059
Cara's friend Sam
and his partner?

40:28.159 --> 40:29.427
They're stepping up
for Michael.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.863
They're gonna
take him in.
That's great.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.966
You did good
by that boy, Beau.

40:39.304 --> 40:42.974
I'm not going back in the field.
I belong in the lab.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.013
Penny had something
similar that happened.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.981
And what
she discovered is that...

40:50.081 --> 40:53.051
With all due respect,
it's not the same, Max.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.521
This isn't
my first job. Mm.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.856
I walked away from a C-suite
title at Dow to come here.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.625
And you became
a criminalist for a reason.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.326
I'm-I'm...

41:01.426 --> 41:03.061
I'm sorry.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.664
I'm just not gonna accept
your resignation

41:05.764 --> 41:07.799
from the field. Max...

41:07.899 --> 41:10.301
I'm either in the lab
or I'm nowhere.

41:12.403 --> 41:14.105
Okay.
