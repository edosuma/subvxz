WEBVTT

00:05.375 --> 00:08.041
You are freaking out, Crane.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.375
Hardly.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.166
I'm making preparations

00:10.375 --> 00:13.166
for restoring Pandora's box.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.625
Oh, I know you well enough

00:13.166 --> 00:15.625
to know when you're bugging.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.291
Very well, perhaps I am

00:18.291 --> 00:19.958
a little more

00:18.291 --> 00:19.958
than moderately agitated.

00:19.958 --> 00:21.500
And for good reason--

00:21.500 --> 00:23.791
finding Betsy Ross alive,

00:21.500 --> 00:23.791
trapped down here.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.375
It's what happens when she

00:23.791 --> 00:26.375
leaves that concerns me more.

00:26.375 --> 00:29.166
If Betsy enters the Well

00:26.375 --> 00:29.166
you used to leave this place,

00:29.166 --> 00:32.875
she will return

00:29.166 --> 00:32.875
in her own time, so...

00:32.875 --> 00:35.208
you and I

00:32.875 --> 00:35.208
must endeavor to

00:35.208 --> 00:38.041
help her on her way

00:35.208 --> 00:38.041
as soon as she returns

00:38.041 --> 00:39.375
from scouting

00:38.041 --> 00:39.375
the environs.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.666
And we cannot let on

00:40.666 --> 00:42.583
that we are from the future.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.583
Or we risk

00:42.583 --> 00:43.625
damaging the time stream.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.791
I get it. I saw  Star Wars.

00:45.791 --> 00:49.708
Trek  not  Wars,  but yes.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.708
As Captain James Tiberius Kirk

00:49.708 --> 00:52.708
learned the hard way

00:52.708 --> 00:54.458
in the most

00:52.708 --> 00:54.458
memorable episode,

00:54.458 --> 00:56.166
"City on the Edge of Forever."

00:56.166 --> 00:58.041
Okay, well, I will let you

00:56.166 --> 00:58.041
be the one to bring up

00:58.041 --> 01:00.083
jumping into

00:58.041 --> 01:00.083
a bottomless well.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.500
BETSY:

01:00.083 --> 01:01.500
My circumnavigation

01:01.500 --> 01:04.166
has revealed nothing of

01:01.500 --> 01:04.166
use to the war effort.

01:04.166 --> 01:07.708
Yeah, nothing but sand and sun

01:04.166 --> 01:07.708
for over 1,000 miles.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.583
Which makes me wonder

01:07.708 --> 01:09.583
how you came to acquire

01:09.583 --> 01:11.750
such intimate knowledge

01:09.583 --> 01:11.750
of the Catacombs.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.666
That information we

01:11.750 --> 01:14.666
cannot share, Betsy.

01:14.666 --> 01:17.166
You see, we are more than

01:14.666 --> 01:17.166
simply a rescue mission.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.541
We have very

01:17.166 --> 01:19.541
specific orders

01:19.541 --> 01:21.875
from General Washington.

01:21.875 --> 01:24.083
He would only have shared the

01:21.875 --> 01:24.083
existence of the supernatural

01:24.083 --> 01:27.416
with you in the most dire

01:24.083 --> 01:27.416
of circumstances.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.500
Or sent a stranger

01:30.625 --> 01:33.500
to accompany you.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.083
In your absence,

01:33.500 --> 01:36.083
Lieutenant Mills and I

01:36.083 --> 01:38.416
have formed a very

01:36.083 --> 01:38.416
strong partnership.

01:38.416 --> 01:40.041
Lieutenant?

01:42.583 --> 01:45.875
There are no female officers

01:42.583 --> 01:45.875
in the Continental Army.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.291
It's a pet name.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.250
I...

01:50.250 --> 01:51.833
call him Crane.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.916
CRANE:

01:51.833 --> 01:53.916
Regrettably,

01:53.916 --> 01:57.958
the veil of secrecy precludes

01:53.916 --> 01:57.958
our sharing of details, Betsy.

01:57.958 --> 01:59.916
We are to restore a powerful,

01:57.958 --> 01:59.916
supernatural artifact,

01:59.916 --> 02:02.416
and it is our only hope

02:02.416 --> 02:06.041
against a foe who holds the fate

02:02.416 --> 02:06.041
of the world in his hands.

02:10.541 --> 02:12.208
"Here rests

02:12.208 --> 02:15.583
"the container that holds

02:12.208 --> 02:15.583
all the evil of the world.

02:15.583 --> 02:18.041
"Dark vessel of nightmare.

02:18.041 --> 02:22.000
(echoing):

02:18.041 --> 02:22.000
"Dread urn forged in the void.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.166
Let that which is broken

02:22.000 --> 02:26.166
be remade."

02:43.333 --> 02:45.916
When last we saw this box,

02:43.333 --> 02:45.916
'twas silver in hue.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.125
Did we do something wrong?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.833
I performed the incantation

02:47.125 --> 02:49.833
as instructed.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.500
Over here.

02:59.708 --> 03:03.666
Cuneiform is the same

02:59.708 --> 03:03.666
as on the pedestal.

03:03.666 --> 03:06.708
"Binding the evils

03:03.666 --> 03:06.708
of the world.

03:06.708 --> 03:10.416
"A radiance given by...

03:10.416 --> 03:12.458
"one who bears Witness.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
An Eternal Soul."

03:17.125 --> 03:19.625
Pandora made

03:17.125 --> 03:19.625
no reference to this.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.291
That can't be good.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.250
CRANE:

03:21.291 --> 03:23.250
No, nor the reference

03:23.250 --> 03:26.125
to Witness,

03:23.250 --> 03:26.125
specifically this...

03:26.125 --> 03:28.000
Eternal Soul.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.916
I fear

03:29.625 --> 03:31.916
the missing ingredient

03:31.916 --> 03:34.250
may be one of us.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.750
Lieutenant!

03:35.750 --> 03:37.000
(loud whooshing)

03:39.750 --> 03:41.375
(grunting)

03:44.375 --> 03:47.000
(gasping)

03:44.375 --> 03:47.000
Lieutenant...

03:47.000 --> 03:48.916
are you all right?

03:48.916 --> 03:50.041
Fine.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.250
(panting)

03:51.250 --> 03:52.916
Its bark is worse

03:51.250 --> 03:52.916
than its bite.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.583
The Box--

03:56.583 --> 03:57.875
we did it.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.458
Which means it got

03:57.875 --> 03:59.458
what it needed.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.500
(groans)

04:02.500 --> 04:03.708
No, no.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.166
Abbie.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.833
There's a pulse.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.666
It feels very faint.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.875
Crane...

04:18.875 --> 04:20.208
Save your strength.

04:25.875 --> 04:29.416
I hope you got the plates

04:25.875 --> 04:29.416
off the truck that hit me.

04:29.416 --> 04:33.250
The Box took something precious.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.791
There's a void.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.541
Something's wrong.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.000
We'll fix it.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.333
We've come back

04:43.000 --> 04:45.333
from worse.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.458
It is a side of the job

04:46.833 --> 04:49.458
that is never advertised.

04:49.458 --> 04:53.083
And we were just talking about,

04:49.458 --> 04:53.083
on the way here, cheating death.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.583
Enough of that.

04:56.833 --> 05:00.041
Perhaps Washington or Revere

04:56.833 --> 05:00.041
can help her when we get back.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.791
We're not coming back

05:07.750 --> 05:09.791
with you, Betsy.

05:09.791 --> 05:12.458
You are not the Crane I know.

05:12.458 --> 05:16.375
Betsy, believe me, I am telling

05:12.458 --> 05:16.375
the truth in that I...

05:16.375 --> 05:18.125
cannot tell the whole truth.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.583
Only one truth matters.

05:22.208 --> 05:26.000
Your heart belongs

05:22.208 --> 05:26.000
to Abigail Mills.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.583
She is my partner.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.833
I must leave this place.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.833
Um...

05:37.833 --> 05:39.583
at the far end

05:37.833 --> 05:39.583
of the plateau

05:39.583 --> 05:42.666
there is a Well beside

05:39.583 --> 05:42.666
the stump of a tree.

05:42.666 --> 05:45.166
Enter and...

05:45.166 --> 05:47.708
you will return

05:45.166 --> 05:47.708
from whence you came.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.541
Miss Mills.

05:51.541 --> 05:54.666
You have a good partner

05:51.541 --> 05:54.666
in Ichabod Crane.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.791
Put him in his place

05:54.666 --> 05:56.791
every once in a while.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.208
Keeps him honest.

06:17.875 --> 06:21.333
I'm sorry about how

06:17.875 --> 06:21.333
things ended with Betsy.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.125
At least now I understand

06:21.333 --> 06:23.125
why we never spoke

06:23.125 --> 06:24.875
after she returned from this...

06:24.875 --> 06:27.041
dreadful place.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.625
Our partnership

06:28.625 --> 06:32.041
was a prelude to a destiny

06:28.625 --> 06:32.041
I could never have imagined.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.875
One I share with you.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.333
Shall we?

06:38.333 --> 06:41.500
Well, not until you tell me

06:38.333 --> 06:41.500
whatever it is...

06:41.500 --> 06:43.750
you don't want to tell me.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.958
The tablet I found

06:43.750 --> 06:46.958
in my family crypt

06:46.958 --> 06:50.375
had a symbol on it I could not

06:46.958 --> 06:50.375
translate until today,

06:50.375 --> 06:53.666
when it appeared on

06:50.375 --> 06:53.666
the wall of the antechamber.

06:53.666 --> 06:56.666
It reads, "Eternal Soul,"

06:56.666 --> 06:59.291
meaning the soul

06:56.666 --> 06:59.291
of a Witness

06:59.291 --> 07:01.041
that the Box requires.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.208
Which is why

07:04.333 --> 07:06.208
Pandora sent us both.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.250
There are powerful forces

07:07.250 --> 07:09.875
at work here,

07:09.875 --> 07:12.375
and I do not intend

07:09.875 --> 07:12.375
to be pawn to them.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.333
We make our own destiny.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.291
Right now, we are destined

07:16.291 --> 07:18.916
to take a plunge.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.333
Let's do this.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.958
In through a tree,

07:20.333 --> 07:21.958
out through a well.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.041
How about an escalator

07:21.958 --> 07:24.041
to the Catacombs?

07:24.041 --> 07:27.958
It would not have the same

07:24.041 --> 07:27.958
metaphorical heft, I fear.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.291
Now...

07:35.291 --> 07:38.583
let us not miss the perfect

07:35.291 --> 07:38.583
opportunity for embracing...

07:38.583 --> 07:40.250
(echoing):

07:38.583 --> 07:40.250
Tally-ho!

07:42.291 --> 07:44.916
That was not very sporting!

07:50.666 --> 07:51.625
(grunts)

07:51.625 --> 07:54.125
What she said.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.750
♪ ♪

08:36.666 --> 08:37.916
(door opens)

08:37.916 --> 08:41.625
Abbie, you made it.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.125
(grunts)

08:44.625 --> 08:45.625
The mission was a success.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.208
ABBIE: How'd it go on this end?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.208
Where is everyone?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.083
Where's Joe, Sophie, Reynolds?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.375
Dad.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.125
Jennifer asked me to come.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.166
What's wrong? What happened?

09:04.166 --> 09:06.333
It's Joe.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.041
He, uh...

09:09.583 --> 09:12.000
(crying):

09:09.583 --> 09:12.000
He turned again.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.666
The Hidden One...

09:14.666 --> 09:15.750
I'm sorry.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.083
Joe was our brother.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.666
And mine.

09:28.791 --> 09:31.000
My condolences, Miss Jenny.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.291
Master Corbin

09:32.625 --> 09:34.291
fought bravely,

09:34.291 --> 09:36.000
and he saved

09:34.291 --> 09:36.000
countless lives,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.416
and we will honor him

09:37.416 --> 09:40.583
by picking up his standard

09:37.416 --> 09:40.583
and marching on.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.500
Believe me...

09:42.500 --> 09:45.041
the Hidden One

09:42.500 --> 09:45.041
will pay for this.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.875
I've been looking for ways

09:54.500 --> 09:56.875
to modify our arsenal,

09:56.875 --> 09:59.416
searching for myths

09:56.875 --> 09:59.416
in which gods are killed,

09:59.416 --> 10:00.791
like the Norse Ragnarok.

10:00.791 --> 10:02.833
Twilight of the Gods.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.625
The battle in which

10:03.916 --> 10:05.625
all existence

10:05.625 --> 10:07.083
was destroyed and remade.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.208
We just need to get

10:07.083 --> 10:09.208
around that part.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.541
Nothing is where

10:09.208 --> 10:10.541
it used to be.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.250
You been here before?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.041
Many years ago.

10:14.041 --> 10:16.375
My friendship with August Corbin

10:14.041 --> 10:16.375
was strained, but there was...

10:16.375 --> 10:18.625
always mutual respect.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.333
Oh, here it is.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.541
The Elder Edda. (blows)

10:25.541 --> 10:28.208
If there's a clue

10:25.541 --> 10:28.208
in the Ragnarok myth,

10:28.208 --> 10:29.708
you'll find it here.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.291
But a weapon

10:29.708 --> 10:31.291
powerful enough

10:31.291 --> 10:32.500
to take down a god?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.000
It's a tall order.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.166
And we have just the thing,

10:35.166 --> 10:36.166
but the Box

10:36.166 --> 10:37.541
is no use without Pandora.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.583
The Hidden One disappeared

10:37.541 --> 10:39.583
with her to parts unknown.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.958
CRANE:

10:39.583 --> 10:40.958
And these...

10:40.958 --> 10:43.708
chirosiphones

10:40.958 --> 10:43.708
have proven most useful

10:43.708 --> 10:45.541
against all manner of creatures.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.708
Shouldn't take long

10:45.541 --> 10:47.708
to whip up some Greek Fire.

10:47.708 --> 10:48.708
(chuckles)

10:48.708 --> 10:49.875
If you have a moment.

10:54.541 --> 10:57.166
I'll, um...

10:54.541 --> 10:57.166
make the arrangements for Joe.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.583
I owe it to his father.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.416
And you girls

11:00.583 --> 11:02.416
have bigger fish to fry.

11:02.416 --> 11:03.791
Thank you.

11:03.791 --> 11:06.125
And thank you

11:03.791 --> 11:06.125
for looking after Jenny.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.875
It's nothing but a thing.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.083
All that water

11:07.875 --> 11:10.083
under the bridge--

11:10.083 --> 11:12.958
doesn't make us

11:10.083 --> 11:12.958
any less a family.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.958
Amen to that.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.166
Are you okay?

11:22.166 --> 11:23.416
I'm fine.

11:26.375 --> 11:29.416
I have a thousand questions

11:26.375 --> 11:29.416
that I want to ask you,

11:29.416 --> 11:31.208
but right now is not the time.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.916
No, but when

11:31.208 --> 11:33.916
the moment's right,

11:33.916 --> 11:37.000
there is much I need

11:33.916 --> 11:37.000
to tell you, young lady.

11:38.208 --> 11:40.291
I look forward to it.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.208
Sorry about your friend.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.416
We'll pay our respects when

11:49.208 --> 11:51.416
we stop the world from ending.

11:51.416 --> 11:54.000
We got the Box.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.708
Now we need

11:54.000 --> 11:55.708
to find its owner.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.166
We've been monitoring

11:55.708 --> 11:57.166
emergency bands.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.208
National Weather Service

11:57.166 --> 11:59.208
is on alert.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.250
There's a freak storm

11:59.208 --> 12:01.250
building over the Hudson Valley.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.416
ABBIE:

12:01.250 --> 12:02.416
Wild guess--

12:02.416 --> 12:04.125
target's at

12:02.416 --> 12:04.125
the epicenter.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.583
All right, thanks.

12:06.583 --> 12:09.291
Just doing our part

12:06.583 --> 12:09.291
for Team Witness, right?

12:09.291 --> 12:10.958
Not just for that.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.666
For taking all this

12:10.958 --> 12:12.666
in stride.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.625
I'm just glad

12:12.666 --> 12:14.625
we're all on the same page.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.416
Me, too, Danny.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.750
You and Sophie

12:19.000 --> 12:21.750
stay on overwatch.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.666
Keep the situation

12:21.750 --> 12:23.666
under wraps.

12:23.666 --> 12:26.208
I'm gonna get the Box

12:23.666 --> 12:26.208
back to Pandora.

12:35.416 --> 12:36.833
(thunder rumbling)

12:36.833 --> 12:39.958
Husband, release me

12:36.833 --> 12:39.958
from this prison.

12:42.458 --> 12:46.666
I have decided, Pandora,

12:42.458 --> 12:46.666
my rise shall be in stages.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.583
Rivers running red.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.666
Crops turning black.

12:50.666 --> 12:55.041
Water, water everywhere...

12:55.041 --> 12:57.833
and not a drop to drink.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.875
(loud whooshing)

13:05.625 --> 13:07.416
I was wondering

13:07.416 --> 13:09.625
when you were gonna make

13:07.416 --> 13:09.625
your last stand, Witness.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.333
Feed, my precious one.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.500
HIDDEN ONE:

13:38.333 --> 13:39.500
Enough of this!

13:41.625 --> 13:45.125
Feed as you never have before.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.291
Impossible.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.958
CRANE:

13:48.333 --> 13:49.958
No...

13:49.958 --> 13:51.583
just highly improbable.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.208
Which, as luck would have it,

13:54.208 --> 13:56.833
is our stock in trade.

13:57.875 --> 13:59.625
(grunts)

14:03.916 --> 14:05.125
No.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.208
I will not allow it.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.541
ABBIE:

14:11.125 --> 14:12.541
What's wrong?

14:12.541 --> 14:14.125
You had him on the ropes.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.958
It cannot draw any more energy.

14:15.958 --> 14:17.958
In order to stop him,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.083
you know what it needs,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.083
Abbie.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.458
You're resisting.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.583
You're holding on to hope.

14:26.666 --> 14:31.125
It hungers for the light

14:26.666 --> 14:31.125
at the center of your being.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.208
It needs...

14:33.208 --> 14:36.250
a binding agent to hold the

14:33.208 --> 14:36.250
darkness together, Abbie.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.166
He's getting

14:36.250 --> 14:38.166
his power back.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.041
It needs the rest

14:38.166 --> 14:41.041
of your Eternal Soul.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.375
In the Catacombs,

14:42.833 --> 14:45.375
Abbie, you beat it.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.958
The Box didn't finish.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.458
Because you closed it

14:46.958 --> 14:48.458
before it could.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.333
Yes.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.875
PANDORA:

14:50.333 --> 14:51.875
Open it.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.958
Give it what it needs.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.208
Only you can

14:54.958 --> 14:57.208
do this, Abbie.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.250
CRANE:

14:57.208 --> 14:58.250
No.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.500
There has to be another way.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.791
He will kill us all.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.041
Open it.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.416
Save the world, Abbie.

15:14.458 --> 15:15.708
No, Abbie!

15:18.583 --> 15:19.583
PANDORA:

15:18.583 --> 15:19.583
Yes.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.208
Yes.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.541
Let it speak to you.

15:27.541 --> 15:30.416
Give it your strength.

15:30.416 --> 15:31.708
Give it your hope.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.125
Give it your life!

15:39.500 --> 15:41.500
(loud rumbling)

15:44.041 --> 15:45.375
Abbie!

15:51.583 --> 15:53.625
Crane...

15:55.000 --> 15:57.541
...never give up hope.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.208
Abbie...

16:12.083 --> 16:13.458
Abbie, no!

16:26.791 --> 16:29.833
Feeling contrite,

16:26.791 --> 16:29.833
I imagine.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.583
Beg for forgiveness.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.833
Beg for your life.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.958
(raspy breathing)

16:40.958 --> 16:43.125
I would do whatever you ask.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.541
That was for Joe.

16:54.041 --> 16:56.416
How dare you.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.208
This was my victory,

16:56.416 --> 16:59.208
not yours.

17:01.541 --> 17:03.166
Pandora.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.750
The threat is over.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.625
Now...

17:09.625 --> 17:11.625
wherever this container

17:09.625 --> 17:11.625
took Abbie,

17:11.625 --> 17:13.250
return her.

17:14.666 --> 17:17.375
I'm through

17:14.666 --> 17:17.375
being ordered around.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.083
No, no.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.708
We retrieved

17:19.083 --> 17:20.708
this Box for you.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.458
We gave you

17:20.708 --> 17:22.458
everything you asked.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.625
And now you can be

17:22.458 --> 17:24.625
the first to worship me.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.500
The Hidden One is dead.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.458
I have his power now.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.750
I won't ask much

17:28.458 --> 17:30.750
of my followers,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.833
only that they serve me,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.833
obey me,

17:32.833 --> 17:34.666
and as is fitting, fear me.

17:34.666 --> 17:36.666
What did you do to my sister?

17:36.666 --> 17:40.625
I had no recourse but to use

17:36.666 --> 17:40.625
her spirit to reform the Box,

17:40.625 --> 17:42.500
pushed to the edge as I was.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.000
You used us.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.333
We used each other.

17:46.916 --> 17:48.500
Let's call it even.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.750
Damn you.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.666
Damn you!

17:49.750 --> 17:51.666
No, Crane, wait.

17:54.666 --> 17:57.333
We need her...

17:57.333 --> 17:59.125
to get Abbie back.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.625
My husband let power

18:10.625 --> 18:12.875
go to his head.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.583
I won't make the same mistake.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.416
I don't want

18:14.583 --> 18:16.416
to destroy this world.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.875
I quite like it.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.333
As long as I am obeyed,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.583
I will be a benevolent goddess.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.583
(snaps fingers)

18:34.000 --> 18:36.291
Tell me it's not true.

18:36.291 --> 18:40.000
Abbie did what she did

18:36.291 --> 18:40.000
to save us all.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.708
So she's just gone?

18:42.708 --> 18:44.041
Just like that?

18:44.041 --> 18:46.083
CRANE:

18:44.041 --> 18:46.083
No.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.583
Not gone.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.708
But she is trapped

18:47.583 --> 18:50.708
in an infernal Box.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.041
We have brought

18:50.708 --> 18:52.041
her back

18:52.041 --> 18:53.958
from purgatory,

18:52.041 --> 18:53.958
from the Catacombs,

18:53.958 --> 18:56.833
and we will free her

18:53.958 --> 18:56.833
again now, today.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.291
If she's trapped inside the Box,

18:56.833 --> 18:59.291
how do we get her out?

18:59.291 --> 19:01.041
Pandora's the cause;

18:59.291 --> 19:01.041
she is the solution.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.291
She controls the Box.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.083
She can release

19:02.291 --> 19:04.083
the lieutenant.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.541
How do we twist her arm when

19:04.083 --> 19:06.541
she's stolen the power of a god?

19:06.541 --> 19:08.625
'Tis not the only power

19:06.541 --> 19:08.625
she stole.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.500
JENNY:

19:14.083 --> 19:16.500
The Blavatsky Map.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.791
It locates monsters.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.166
'Tis time we fought fire

19:18.791 --> 19:22.166
with fire.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.666
♪ Well, your hands

19:27.083 --> 19:28.666
are getting friendly ♪

19:28.666 --> 19:31.166
♪ But I know exactly

19:28.666 --> 19:31.166
where they are... ♪

19:31.166 --> 19:33.041
AUGUST:

19:31.166 --> 19:33.041
Ice cream's getting warm.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.083
Pie's getting cold.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.500
Not a good combo.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.916
Take a seat, kiddo.

19:40.916 --> 19:43.458
Coffee works twice as good

19:40.916 --> 19:43.458
as pinching yourself.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.958
I didn't figure you

19:43.458 --> 19:44.958
for an angel.

19:44.958 --> 19:46.000
(laughs)

19:46.000 --> 19:47.666
Me? (chuckles)

19:47.666 --> 19:48.750
Not even.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.166
You know what kind of pension

19:50.166 --> 19:51.833
those fools get?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.375
No, this isn't heaven, kid,

19:53.375 --> 19:55.000
not by a long shot.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.833
Is it hell?

19:58.375 --> 19:59.708
The pie's too good.

19:59.708 --> 20:00.916
Well, the last time

20:00.916 --> 20:02.958
I saw your face,

20:00.916 --> 20:02.958
it was on a demon.

20:02.958 --> 20:05.708
I'm what's left of the man

20:02.958 --> 20:05.708
you knew, warts and all.

20:05.708 --> 20:07.208
Made his share

20:05.708 --> 20:07.208
of mistakes.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.666
It cost him...

20:08.666 --> 20:09.916
and his son.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.625
You know about Joe.

20:11.625 --> 20:15.750
He was a soldier,

20:11.625 --> 20:15.750
like his old man, like you.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.166
Soldier knows

20:15.750 --> 20:19.166
when to make a sacrifice.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.291
Keep the world turning.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.208
Springsteen making records,

20:21.291 --> 20:24.208
kids on swings,

20:24.208 --> 20:26.458
trouts in the stream,

20:24.208 --> 20:26.458
all that good stuff.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.708
You made that same sacrifice,

20:26.458 --> 20:28.708
Abbie.

20:31.166 --> 20:35.041
It was me or the world,

20:31.166 --> 20:35.041
and my world felt complete.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.583
I made peace

20:35.041 --> 20:36.583
with my sister,

20:36.583 --> 20:38.250
Daniel Reynolds,

20:38.250 --> 20:41.708
found my dad,

20:38.250 --> 20:41.708
your old friend Ezra.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.291
You've come a long way.

20:43.291 --> 20:46.750
And now you've come

20:43.291 --> 20:46.750
to take me into the light.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.791
(laughs)

20:46.750 --> 20:48.791
Pearly gates?

20:48.791 --> 20:50.708
(laughing)

20:50.708 --> 20:52.750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.916
Not yet, anyway.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.875
You ever hear of the phoenix?

20:56.875 --> 20:59.500
Yeah, magical bird,

20:56.875 --> 20:59.500
when it dies,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.958
it immolates itself, and from

20:59.500 --> 21:01.958
the ashes another one arises.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.375
Right, so when you see

21:03.375 --> 21:05.583
that bird, it's the same bird,

21:05.583 --> 21:07.583
only it isn't.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.458
When did you get

21:07.583 --> 21:10.458
so damn cryptic?

21:10.458 --> 21:12.791
(laughs)

21:12.791 --> 21:15.583
Oh, you want honesty.

21:19.541 --> 21:22.833
I'm proud of you, Agent Mills.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.500
I'm so proud of you.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.833
I know you're ready

21:31.083 --> 21:33.833
for the next adventure.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.916
What?

21:35.916 --> 21:39.250
What happens to Crane?

21:39.250 --> 21:41.875
You know he's still

21:39.250 --> 21:41.875
trying to get you back.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.166
He'll never give up;

21:41.875 --> 21:44.166
he always finds a way.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.458
Yeah, well, you two have that

21:44.166 --> 21:46.458
in common, don't you?

21:46.458 --> 21:49.500
You've taken him

21:46.458 --> 21:49.500
as far as you can, Abbie.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.541
Oh, my God.

21:58.916 --> 22:01.166
Thank you.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.208
Uh...

22:04.208 --> 22:06.208
would you excuse me

22:04.208 --> 22:06.208
for a minute?

22:07.416 --> 22:09.750
I'm gonna go buy my son a beer.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.750
(chuckles)

22:23.125 --> 22:24.333

23:16.666 --> 23:18.875
Blood!

23:18.875 --> 23:20.500
War.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.250
Famine.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.541
Poverty.

23:24.541 --> 23:28.750
A clawing sickness in our souls.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.833
No wonder you seek succor.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.625
I must ask you to leave.

23:32.625 --> 23:34.583
(people murmuring)

23:37.750 --> 23:38.833
(people gasping)

23:38.833 --> 23:42.458
This world has become

23:38.833 --> 23:42.458
a terrifying place.

23:42.458 --> 23:45.250
You want to push

23:42.458 --> 23:45.250
your fears aside,

23:45.250 --> 23:47.916
but they are all around you.

23:47.916 --> 23:50.458
Rejoice!

23:50.458 --> 23:52.250
For I have come.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.375
(chuckles)

23:54.375 --> 23:58.208
And all I ask is for your love,

23:58.208 --> 24:00.375
your adoration,

24:00.375 --> 24:02.416
your respect.

24:02.416 --> 24:04.958
I can take your fears away

24:04.958 --> 24:08.416
or I can send them

24:04.958 --> 24:08.416
slavering to your door.

24:09.458 --> 24:11.250
(loud rumbling)

24:12.625 --> 24:14.166
(people screaming)

24:42.708 --> 24:45.666
Though I loved him dearly,

24:45.666 --> 24:48.291
he loved me not.

24:50.041 --> 24:53.083
I trusted him dearly.

24:53.083 --> 24:56.125
He trusted me not.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.791
Now he lies dead.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.041
Dead, dead, dead.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.833
CRANE:

25:07.458 --> 25:09.833
Pandora!

25:12.458 --> 25:15.458
Abbie-- bring her back.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.000
And if I do not?

25:25.208 --> 25:26.916
Samael,

25:26.916 --> 25:28.583
Abbaddon,

25:28.583 --> 25:31.500
Dark Rider of

25:28.583 --> 25:31.500
the Apocalypse,

25:31.500 --> 25:34.166
I call you forth.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.458
(thunder rumbling)

25:52.166 --> 25:54.583
(horse whinnying)

26:00.958 --> 26:01.791
(whinnying continues)

26:01.791 --> 26:03.541
Horseman!

26:03.541 --> 26:05.625
I called you forth

26:03.541 --> 26:05.625
with a purpose.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.333
A common enemy.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.083
I made very quick work

26:10.083 --> 26:12.250
of you before,

26:10.083 --> 26:12.250
and I will do it again.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.250
You defeated him

26:12.250 --> 26:14.250
absent his true power.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.916
Wait, if you give him the head,

26:15.666 --> 26:18.916
doesn't the apocalypse begin?

26:18.916 --> 26:20.083
Moloch's apocalypse.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.791
Moloch's dead.

26:21.791 --> 26:24.666
Avatar of Death!

26:26.541 --> 26:27.583
End her.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.291
There!

27:04.250 --> 27:06.041
JENNY: You think

27:04.250 --> 27:06.041
he has a chance against her?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.125
He is the embodiment of death.

27:08.125 --> 27:08.958
No need to fight.

27:09.833 --> 27:11.958
I could use

27:11.958 --> 27:14.458
a strapping gentleman

27:11.958 --> 27:14.458
like you by my side.

27:20.458 --> 27:21.291
Oh, no.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.791
He can't do it on his own.

27:41.791 --> 27:42.791
Stay here.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.500
Crane!

27:50.583 --> 27:52.416
Do you feel that, Witness?

27:54.041 --> 27:56.166
The pain...

27:56.166 --> 27:58.291
the loss, the fear!

28:03.666 --> 28:05.541
JENNY:

28:03.666 --> 28:05.541
Crane!

28:05.541 --> 28:06.458
Hey.

28:06.458 --> 28:08.583
I lost her. I lost her.

28:08.583 --> 28:09.750
Hey...

28:08.583 --> 28:09.750
I lost Abbie.

28:09.750 --> 28:10.833
Hey, listen to me!

28:10.833 --> 28:12.250
She is with you.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.833
She sacrificed herself

28:12.250 --> 28:14.833
so that you could be here

28:14.833 --> 28:17.041
and win the day.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.125
Don't you dare

28:17.041 --> 28:19.125
let that be for nothing.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.708
There is always another way.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.708
(grunting)

28:39.666 --> 28:41.333
Horseman!

28:51.250 --> 28:52.083
Enough!

28:54.750 --> 28:55.750
It's over.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.916
Enough death

29:02.541 --> 29:04.916
for one night.

29:04.916 --> 29:07.291
Leave.

29:19.916 --> 29:24.208
Death wins in the end,

29:19.916 --> 29:24.208
it seems...

29:24.208 --> 29:26.791
even for a goddess.

29:29.041 --> 29:32.416
You love her, don't you?

29:35.166 --> 29:38.541
She is your hope...

29:38.541 --> 29:40.375
your everything.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.416
I took her from you.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.333
Let her out.

29:46.708 --> 29:49.166
Let her out now.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.416
It's over.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.833
(gasping)

29:57.500 --> 29:59.625
She was never inside it.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.291
She's dead.

30:06.250 --> 30:07.791
Dead and gone.

30:12.416 --> 30:14.041
The Box...

30:14.041 --> 30:15.333
it's gonna explode again.

30:18.666 --> 30:19.666
Quickly.

30:18.666 --> 30:19.666
Okay.

30:19.666 --> 30:21.875
Quickly!

30:37.291 --> 30:39.083
(door slams)

30:40.458 --> 30:41.458
(explosion)

30:46.958 --> 30:48.375
(lock buzzes)

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
Crane.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.541
Abbie.

30:59.750 --> 31:02.291
Unlock the door.

31:02.291 --> 31:03.666
Let's go home.

31:03.666 --> 31:05.916
You're going back, Crane.

31:05.916 --> 31:08.541
We don't have long.

31:08.541 --> 31:11.458
It's time to say good-bye.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.833
No.

31:13.833 --> 31:14.958
No, Abbie.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.166
Abbie, don't.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.416
Abbie!

31:24.958 --> 31:26.875
I saw the Box take you.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.083
It did.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.166
Used my soul.

31:30.166 --> 31:31.875
But now the Box

31:30.166 --> 31:31.875
is broken to bits.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.000
You saw to that.

31:34.833 --> 31:36.708
I'm free.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.416
We...

31:38.416 --> 31:40.375
are Eternal Souls, Crane.

31:40.375 --> 31:41.625
What does that mean?

31:41.625 --> 31:43.250
Well, I don't really

31:41.625 --> 31:43.250
know myself,

31:43.250 --> 31:45.375
but I couldn't go

31:43.250 --> 31:45.375
into the light.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.291
There was an

31:45.375 --> 31:47.291
old friend there,

31:47.291 --> 31:50.750
who came to tell me

31:47.291 --> 31:50.750
that my job is done.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.583
And this place...

31:58.583 --> 32:00.583
where are we?

32:00.583 --> 32:03.500
It's a waiting room

32:00.583 --> 32:03.500
between life and death.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.500
I am being called.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.625
No, Abbie, we began

32:07.625 --> 32:09.833
this journey together,

32:07.625 --> 32:09.833
we will end it together.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.625
My journey isn't over.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.958
And for a Witness,

32:11.625 --> 32:13.958
it never truly is.

32:13.958 --> 32:15.916
But...

32:15.916 --> 32:19.166
Abbie Mills has done

32:15.916 --> 32:19.166
what she's supposed to do.

32:25.458 --> 32:27.458
(door opens)

32:27.458 --> 32:29.666
I don't understand.

32:29.666 --> 32:31.500
Don't try.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.625
It's more something...

32:36.625 --> 32:38.083
you feel.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.541
Your whole life...

32:43.541 --> 32:45.416
has finally fallen

32:43.541 --> 32:45.416
into place.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.458
Mm-hmm.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.708
Yes, it has.

32:49.708 --> 32:53.083
I made peace

32:49.708 --> 32:53.083
with it, Crane.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.083
Whatever this next stage is,

32:55.083 --> 32:56.875
I'm ready.

32:56.875 --> 32:59.625
It's time for a new beginning.

32:59.625 --> 33:04.333
What is there for me

32:59.625 --> 33:04.333
in a world without you?

33:07.208 --> 33:08.750
Think about it.

33:08.750 --> 33:12.208
Washington knew

33:08.750 --> 33:12.208
that you had a destiny.

33:12.208 --> 33:15.083
You've had mentors

33:12.208 --> 33:15.083
like Benjamin Franklin

33:15.083 --> 33:18.458
and Thomas Jefferson,

33:15.083 --> 33:18.458
and partners...

33:18.458 --> 33:21.416
like Betsy Ross...

33:21.416 --> 33:22.666
and me.

33:22.666 --> 33:25.583
Our job was

33:22.666 --> 33:25.583
to carry you forward.

33:25.583 --> 33:28.291
My job is done.

33:29.333 --> 33:31.458
No.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.000
Not good-bye.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.083
It's more like:

33:33.000 --> 33:36.083
until we meet again.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.041
In the meantime,

33:39.625 --> 33:42.041
bash some monsters for me.

33:42.041 --> 33:43.125
(chuckles)

33:43.125 --> 33:44.416
And look out for my sister.

33:44.416 --> 33:45.875
Abbie.

33:51.375 --> 33:53.583
I shall miss you.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.916
Do more than that.

33:56.916 --> 33:59.916
Honor our bond.

33:59.916 --> 34:01.875
And be brave.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.500
Be strong.

34:06.583 --> 34:08.500
I know you will be.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.333
You're my guy, always.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.583
My, my.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.208
Be still, my

34:22.583 --> 34:24.208
beating heart.

34:24.208 --> 34:26.833
(laughs)

34:45.375 --> 34:47.291
JENNY (echoing):

34:45.375 --> 34:47.291
Crane!

34:47.291 --> 34:50.291
Crane! Crane!

34:50.291 --> 34:53.083
Crane.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.250
Oh, my God. Hey.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.791
Abbie?

35:05.666 --> 35:08.125
(sighs)

35:08.750 --> 35:11.083
(sighs)

35:11.083 --> 35:13.125
(grunts)

35:23.708 --> 35:25.500
She's gone.

35:28.291 --> 35:30.416
She's really gone.

35:34.708 --> 35:36.708
No.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.583
The Box may have

35:41.000 --> 35:43.583
taken her hope.

35:45.916 --> 35:47.833
But she is--

35:47.833 --> 35:51.375
and will forever be--

35:51.375 --> 35:53.916
ours.

36:20.541 --> 36:23.708
Are you certain you would not

36:20.541 --> 36:23.708
like my company, Miss Jenny?

36:25.541 --> 36:28.958
Thanks for asking,

36:25.541 --> 36:28.958
but I think this is something

36:28.958 --> 36:30.708
I have to do by myself.

36:32.208 --> 36:34.291
Joe always said he wanted

36:32.208 --> 36:34.291
to spend more time

36:34.291 --> 36:37.500
up at his dad's cabin,

36:34.291 --> 36:37.500
and I thought I'd...

36:37.500 --> 36:40.416
spread his ashes in the lake.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.166
It's fitting.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.833
A serene resting place.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.333
You are coming back?

36:54.333 --> 36:56.000
Someone's got to keep you

36:54.333 --> 36:56.000
out of trouble.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.125
Tell my sister I said hello,

37:01.125 --> 37:02.541
and that I miss her.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.041
I always do.

37:24.041 --> 37:28.125
Well, the final season

37:24.041 --> 37:28.125
of  American Idol  has begun.

37:28.125 --> 37:31.291
It's not a return to form.

37:33.375 --> 37:37.416
Requires your

37:33.375 --> 37:37.416
spirited commentary.

37:37.416 --> 37:41.166
Oh, I've been accepted

37:37.416 --> 37:41.166
as archivist

37:41.166 --> 37:43.750
to the Historical Society,

37:41.166 --> 37:43.750
and I'm moving forward

37:43.750 --> 37:45.708
with my

37:43.750 --> 37:45.708
citizenship application.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.708
Slowly.

37:50.708 --> 37:54.666
Your house is now up for sale.

37:56.250 --> 37:59.791
I've begun the search

37:56.250 --> 37:59.791
for a place of my own.

37:59.791 --> 38:02.208
The rental market

37:59.791 --> 38:02.208
is more murderous

38:02.208 --> 38:04.583
than any supernatural beast

38:02.208 --> 38:04.583
we've fought.

38:06.958 --> 38:10.416
Not a peep on that front.

38:10.416 --> 38:13.833
'Tis a respite

38:10.416 --> 38:13.833
I fear will not last.

38:15.833 --> 38:19.000
This is Sleepy Hollow,

38:15.833 --> 38:19.000
after all.

38:27.666 --> 38:30.083
You are missed.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.666
Never forgotten.

38:34.666 --> 38:37.166
EZRA:

38:34.666 --> 38:37.166
Mr. Crane.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.750
I didn't get a chance

38:43.250 --> 38:45.750
to say the words you spoke

38:45.750 --> 38:48.208
at Abbie's service

38:45.750 --> 38:48.208
were quite lovely...

38:48.208 --> 38:49.916
We don't have much time, Crane.

38:49.916 --> 38:52.083
Abigail's death

38:49.916 --> 38:52.083
has set wheels in motion,

38:52.083 --> 38:54.916
and you need all the information

38:52.083 --> 38:54.916
I can give you.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.416
There must always be

38:54.916 --> 38:57.416
two Witnesses.

38:57.416 --> 39:00.458
When one dies,

38:57.416 --> 39:00.458
their soul does not move on.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.166
It's eternal.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.500
Wait, wait.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.750
Abbie told me this.

39:08.291 --> 39:11.500
It wasn't a dream.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.208
Mr. Mills, if there's

39:11.500 --> 39:13.208
a chance she lives...

39:13.208 --> 39:15.250
No, no, it doesn't

39:13.208 --> 39:15.250
work like that.

39:15.250 --> 39:17.000
Not as I understand it.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.041
The essence of

39:17.000 --> 39:20.041
a Witness's soul finds someone

39:20.041 --> 39:22.208
from their

39:20.041 --> 39:22.208
extended bloodline

39:22.208 --> 39:23.833
and sparks a new Witness.

39:23.833 --> 39:27.583
So Abbie's Eternal Soul

39:23.833 --> 39:27.583
lives on...

39:27.583 --> 39:29.500
in someone else.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.666
Find her before they do.

39:31.666 --> 39:34.000
They'll come

39:31.666 --> 39:34.000
for you, Crane.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.500
And they'll be looking

39:34.000 --> 39:35.500
for her, too.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.791
Who?

39:36.791 --> 39:38.875
This is from

39:36.791 --> 39:38.875
President Washington.

39:45.875 --> 39:49.000
This is dated 1789.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.416
"This Letter of Mark

39:54.291 --> 39:57.416
and Reprisal empowers me..."

39:57.416 --> 39:59.791
"...as First President

39:57.416 --> 39:59.791
of these United States,

39:59.791 --> 40:01.583
"to appoint

39:59.791 --> 40:01.583
Captain Ichabod Crane

40:01.583 --> 40:03.041
Commanding Officer."

40:03.041 --> 40:04.625
This being the Crane I met

40:04.625 --> 40:06.291
in the Catacombs,

40:04.625 --> 40:06.291
not the Crane

40:06.291 --> 40:09.208
who is said to have died

40:06.291 --> 40:09.208
on the battlefield in 1781.

40:09.208 --> 40:11.916
Hundreds of years from now,

40:09.208 --> 40:11.916
the man we know and love

40:11.916 --> 40:13.916
will be the last

40:11.916 --> 40:13.916
of the Founding Fathers,

40:13.916 --> 40:15.750
carrying on

40:13.916 --> 40:15.750
what we have built.

40:15.750 --> 40:19.458
"Captain Crane is to lead

40:15.750 --> 40:19.458
this organization.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.416
"His sworn duty, to stand guard

40:21.416 --> 40:24.875
against all threats

40:21.416 --> 40:24.875
deemed otherworldly."

40:32.833 --> 40:35.208
George Washington founded

40:32.833 --> 40:35.208
a secret organization

40:35.208 --> 40:36.916
to battle the supernatural.

40:36.916 --> 40:39.041
His intentions were noble.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.166
They're not all

40:39.041 --> 40:41.166
bad men,

40:41.166 --> 40:44.083
though many have lost their way.

40:46.291 --> 40:48.125
(tires screeching)

40:48.125 --> 40:49.833

40:49.833 --> 40:52.041
