10:50.526 --> 10:52.445
I'VE BEEN CHECKING ALL OVER.
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.488
I WAS AFRAID OF THAT
WHEN I SAW YOU DRIVE UP.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.490
JOHNNY STOPPED BY
THE MILL THIS MORNING,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.326
ASKED MR. EDWARDS
FOR A RIDE TO MANKATO.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.785

10:59.952 --> 11:02.496
NO, NO, NO. HE TOLD THE BOY
HE OUGHTA BE IN SCHOOL.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.123
JOHNNY SAID HE HAD
YOUR PERMISSION TO TRAVEL,

11:04.290 --> 11:05.875

WANT HIM TO GO.

11:13.049 --> 11:14.884
WELL, I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:15.051 --> 11:16.594

A LOT OF JOHNNY.

11:16.761 --> 11:18.637
IF HE COULDN'T TALK HIM INTO
GOING HOME, HE PROBABLY

11:18.804 --> 11:20.765
JUST GAVE HIM A RIDE
AND HE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.183
