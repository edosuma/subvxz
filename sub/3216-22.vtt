00:03.921 --> 00:07.007
Look, our whole lives we've been
searching for this demon.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.684
We finally know where
this demon's gonna be...

00:16.892 --> 00:18.477
...and now we know how to kill him.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.771
This ends now. I'm ending it.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.148
I don't care what it takes.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.276
-A vision.
-Visions or no visions, the fact is...

00:25.484 --> 00:26.944
...the demon is coming tonight.

00:27.153 --> 00:29.280
And this family's gonna go through
the same hell we went through.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.115
We know you have the gun, John.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.617
-You just declared war.
-I'll bring you the Colt.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.786
The demon is coming.
That gun is all we got.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.122
DEAN: Hand Meg a fake gun,
hope she doesn't notice?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.207
I've been waiting
a long time for this fight.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.626
Nobody's dying tonight.
Not us, not that family.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.296
-Why don't you hand over the gun?
-Maybe I'll just shoot you.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.339
There's more where I came from.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.592
It's coming.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.472
I can't believe you just shot me!

00:54.722 --> 00:56.098
It's a fake.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.147
-Sam, no.
-Let me go. It's still in there.

01:03.439 --> 01:04.774
It's suicide.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.108
-I don't care.
-I do.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.573
That thing killed Jess.
That thing killed Mom.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.117
DEAN: They're gone.
And they're never coming back.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.827
Don't you say that.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.913
Not after all this.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.460
(PHONE RINGING)

01:29.215 --> 01:31.926
You boys really screwed up this time.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.973
Where is he?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.727
MEG: You're never gonna see
your father again.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.942
-They've got Dad.
-Meg?

01:49.568 --> 01:52.112
-What'd she say?
-I just told you, Sammy.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.157
Okay.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.326
Okay.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.545
-What are you doing, Dean?
-We gotta go.

02:08.254 --> 02:11.131
-Why?
-The demon knows we're in Salvation.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.883
It knows we've got the Colt.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.679
-It's got Dad. It's coming for us.
-Good. We've got three bullets left.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.140
Listen, we're not ready. We don't know
how many of them are out there.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.768
Now, we're no good to anybody dead.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.437
We're leaving. Now.

02:34.864 --> 02:38.200
-I'm telling you, we could've taken them.
-What we need is a plan.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.703
They're probably keeping Dad alive.
Just gotta...

02:40.828 --> 02:44.081
...figure out where.
They'll wanna trade him for the gun.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.084
-What?
-Dean, if that were true...

02:47.293 --> 02:49.628
...why didn't Meg mention a trade?

02:50.880 --> 02:53.841
-Dad, he might be--
-Don't.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.260
Look, I don't wanna believe it
any more than you...

02:56.468 --> 02:59.388
...but if he is, all the more reason
to kill this damn thing.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.932
We still have the Colt.
We can finish the job.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.851
Screw the job, Sam.

03:04.059 --> 03:07.229
I'm just trying to do what he'd want.
He would want us to keep going.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.273
Quit talking about him like he's dead.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.151
Listen to me, everything stops
until we get him back.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.236
Do you understand me? Everything.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.618
-So how do we find him?
DEAN: We go to Lincoln.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.953
Start at the warehouse
where he was taken.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.290
Come on. You really think
these demons are gonna leave a trail?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.459
You're right.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.128
We need help.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.365
Here you go.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.954
-What is this, holy water?
-That one is. This is whiskey.

04:11.377 --> 04:14.296
Bobby, thanks. Thanks for everything.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.467
-I wasn't sure if we should come.
-Nonsense. Your daddy needs help.

04:18.717 --> 04:22.304
Yeah, but last time we saw you,
I mean, you did threaten to blast him.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.515
You cocked the shotgun
and everything.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.976
Yeah, well, what can I say?

04:27.184 --> 04:31.313
-John just has that effect on people.
-Yeah, I guess he does.

04:31.397 --> 04:35.859
None of that matters now. All that
matters is that you get him back.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.237
Bobby, this book....

04:38.445 --> 04:41.991
-I've never seen anything like it.
-Key of Solomon?

04:43.117 --> 04:44.618
It's the real deal, all right.

04:44.827 --> 04:47.538
And these-- These protective circles,
they really work?

04:47.746 --> 04:53.627
Hell, yeah. You get a demon in one,
they're trapped. Powerless.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.213
It's like a satanic roach motel.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.841
Man knows his stuff.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.552
BOBBY:
I'll tell you something else too.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.014
This is some serious crap
you boys stepped in.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.598
Oh, yeah?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.977
-How's that?
-Normal year, I hear of...

05:10.185 --> 05:12.855
...say, three demonic possessions.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.940
-Maybe four, tops.
-Yeah?

05:15.190 --> 05:18.444
This year, I heard of 27 so far.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.029
You get what I'm saying?

05:21.030 --> 05:24.658
More and more demons
are walking among us.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.535
-A lot more.
-Do you know why?

05:26.744 --> 05:29.997
No, but I know it's something big.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.999
Storm's coming.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.252
And you boys and your daddy...

05:35.461 --> 05:37.546
...you are smack in the middle of it.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.970
Rumsfeld.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.764
What is it?

05:51.769 --> 05:53.353
Something's wrong.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.194
No more crap, okay?

06:10.496 --> 06:11.830
I want the Colt, Sam.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.583
The real Colt.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.127
Right now.

06:17.586 --> 06:21.507
-We don't have it on us. We buried it.
-Didn't I say, "No more crap"?

06:21.924 --> 06:25.260
I swear, after everything I heard
about you Winchesters...

06:25.469 --> 06:27.930
...I gotta tell you,
I'm a little underwhelmed.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.225
First Johnny tries to
pawn off a fake gun...

06:31.475 --> 06:35.229
...and then he leaves the real gun
with you two chuckleheads.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.438
Lackluster, man.

06:37.689 --> 06:43.112
I mean, did you really think
I wouldn't find you?

06:46.490 --> 06:50.619
Actually, we were counting on it.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.551
Gotcha.

07:22.151 --> 07:25.988
You know, if you wanted to tie me up,
all you had to do was ask.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.660
I salted the doors and windows.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.913
If there are any demons out there,
they ain't getting in.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.550
-Where's our father, Meg?
-You didn't ask very nice.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.178
Where's our father, bitch?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.681
Jeez, you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

07:52.931 --> 07:57.311
-Oh, I forgot. You don't.
-Hey, you think this is a frigging game?

07:57.561 --> 08:01.273
-Where is he? What did you do to him?
-He died screaming.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.859
I killed him myself.

08:14.453 --> 08:18.207
That's kind of a turn on,
you hitting a girl.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.126
You're no girl.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.503
Dean.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.426
-You okay?
-She's lying. He's not dead.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.012
Dean, you gotta be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.681
-Why?
-Because she really is a girl, that's why.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.643
-What are you talking about?
-She's possessed.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.104
That's a human possessed
by a demon. Can't you tell?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.860
You trying to tell me there's an innocent
girl trapped somewhere in there?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.702
That's actually good news.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.008
You gonna read me a story?

09:10.425 --> 09:14.304
Something like that. Hit it, Sam.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.766
(RECITING IN LATIN)

09:21.103 --> 09:24.106
An exorcism? Are you serious?

09:24.189 --> 09:28.568
We're going for it, baby. Head spinning,
projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.122
I'm gonna kill you.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.750
I'm gonna rip the bones
from your body.

09:43.959 --> 09:47.129
No, you're gonna burn in hell.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.089
Unless you tell us where our dad is.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.970
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.518
(RECITING IN LATIN)

10:14.114 --> 10:18.243
He begged for his life
with tears in his eyes.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.122
He begged to see his sons
one last time.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.915
That's when I slit his throat.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.634
For your sake, I hope you're lying.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.970
Because if it's true, I swear to God...

10:37.220 --> 10:40.807
...I will march into hell myself
and I will slaughter...

10:41.016 --> 10:44.728
...each and every one of you
evil sons of bitches, so help me, God.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.503
DEAN:
Where is he?

11:11.421 --> 11:14.549
-You just won't take dead for an answer.
-Where is he?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.218
-Dead.
-No, he's not!

11:16.426 --> 11:18.303
He's not dead. He can't be!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.352
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.164
-He will be!
-Wait! What?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.667
He's not dead.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.002
But he will be
after what we do to him.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.216
-How do we know you're telling the truth?
-You don't.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.928
-Sam--!
-A building, okay?

12:00.178 --> 12:03.265
-A building in Jefferson City.
-Missouri? Where, where? An address.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.184
-I don't know.
-And the demon. Where is it?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.936
I don't know. I swear.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.482
That's everything. That's all I know.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.322
-Finish it.
-What?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.366
-I told you the truth!
-I don't care.

12:21.450 --> 12:25.203
-You son of a bitch, you promised.
-I lied!

12:25.954 --> 12:27.706
Sam.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.334
Sam!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.713
Read.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.049
Maybe we can still use her.
Find out where the demon is.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.551
-She doesn't know.
-She lied!

12:39.759 --> 12:43.680
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped
in there and we've gotta help her.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.349
-You're gonna kill her.
-What?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.436
You said she fell from a building.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.857
That girl's body is broken.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.360
The only thing keeping her alive
is that demon inside.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.655
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.741
We are not gonna leave her like that.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.369
-She is a human being.
-We're gonna put her out of her misery.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.247
Sam, finish it.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.343
Finish it.

14:21.027 --> 14:25.323
She's still alive. Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.748
-Thank you.
-Just take it easy, all right?

14:36.585 --> 14:39.087
Come on, let's-- Let's get her down.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.340
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.261
I gotcha. Gotcha.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.179
It's okay. It's okay.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.351
-A year.
-What?

14:53.602 --> 14:56.354
-It's been a year.
-Just take it easy.

14:57.981 --> 15:02.277
I've been awake for some of it.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.907
I couldn't move my own body.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.288
And things looked-- It--

15:14.831 --> 15:16.291
It's a nightmare.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.210
-Was it telling the truth about our dad?
-Dean.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.047
-We need to know.
-Yes.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.387
But it wants you to know.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.767
They want you to come for him.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.770
If Dad's still alive,
none of that matters.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.325
Where is the demon we're looking for?

15:51.242 --> 15:53.453
Not there.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.832
Other ones. Awful ones.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.503
Where are they keeping our dad?

16:01.711 --> 16:05.423
By the riv-- River.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.890
-Sunrise.
-Sunrise? What does that mean?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.436
What does that mean?

16:53.221 --> 16:56.766
You better hurry up and beat it
before the paramedics get here.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.685
What are you gonna tell them?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.438
You think you guys invented
lying to the cops?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.732
I'll figure something out.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.067
Here, take this.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.070
-You might need it.
-Thanks.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.575
Thanks for everything.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.536
-Be careful, all right?
-You just go find your dad.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.622
And when you do,
you bring him around, would you?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.709
I won't even try to shoot him
this time.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.744
You've been quiet.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.623
Just getting ready.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.462
He's gonna be fine, Dean.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.055
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

18:26.981 --> 18:29.776
Dude, what are you drawing
on my car?

18:29.859 --> 18:31.861
It's called a devil's trap.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.782
-Demons can't get through it or inside it.
-So?

18:36.574 --> 18:39.661
Basically turns the trunk
into a lockbox.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.872
So?

18:43.081 --> 18:47.252
So we have a place to hide the Colt
while we go get Dad.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.754
-We're bringing the Colt with us.
-Can't, Dean.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.675
We only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.

18:53.883 --> 18:57.637
-We gotta use them on the demon.
-No, we have to save Dad, Sam.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.848
Okay, we need
all the help we can get.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.142
Do you know how pissed Dad would be
if we used all the bullets?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.812
-He wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
-I don't care.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.315
I don't care what Dad wants. Since
when do you care what Dad wants?

19:09.524 --> 19:12.443
We wanna kill this demon.
You used to want that too.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.904
Hell, you're the one
who came and got me at school.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.741
You're the one who dragged me back
into this. I'm just trying to finish it.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.708
You and Dad are more alike
than I thought, you know that?

19:26.791 --> 19:29.043
You both can't wait
to sacrifice yourself.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.754
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.261
It's selfish, you know that?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.847
You don't care about anything
but revenge.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.892
That's not true, Dean.
I want Dad back.

19:43.975 --> 19:48.354
They are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.316
That Colt is our only leverage
and you know it, Dean.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.027
We cannot bring that gun.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.654
-We can't.
-Fine.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.157
-I'm serious, Dean.
-I said fine, Sam.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.522
Hey, hey.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.276
I think I know what
Meg meant by "sunrise."

20:46.537 --> 20:49.374
Son of a bitch. It's pretty smart.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.503
If these demons can possess people,
they can possess anybody inside.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.172
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.385
Yeah, so we can't kill them.
A building full of human shields.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.097
They probably know what we look like
too. And they could look like anybody.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.849
-Man, this sucks out loud.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.645
All right, so how the hell
are we gonna get in?

21:13.982 --> 21:16.526
Pull the fire alarm.
Get out all the civilians.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.612
Okay, but then the city responds
in what, seven minutes?

21:19.821 --> 21:21.030
Seven minutes exactly.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.393
Hey, what--? What's happening?
Is it a fire?

22:32.602 --> 22:35.021
We're figuring that out now, sir.
Just stay back.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.647
Well, I got a Yorkie upstairs.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.901
-He pees when he's nervous.
-Sir, you have to stay back.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.674
DEAN: I always wanted
to be a fireman when I grew up.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.218
SAM:
You never told me that.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.900
(KNOCKING)

23:29.951 --> 23:32.787
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.062
Dad.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.114
He's still breathing.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.950
Dad, wake up. Dad!

24:56.454 --> 24:58.581
-Wait. Wait.
-What?

24:59.207 --> 25:01.375
He could be possessed,
for all we know.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.377
-Are you nuts?
-Dean.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.171
We gotta be sure.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.738
Sam?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.201
Why are you splashing water on me?

25:38.246 --> 25:42.124
-Dad, you okay?
-They've been drugging me.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.878
-Where's the Colt?
-Don't worry, Dad.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.630
It's safe.

25:48.923 --> 25:52.802
Good boys. Good boys.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.116
Hey, buddy. You can't go in.

26:27.295 --> 26:30.715
Go. Go. Come on. Back, back. Go.

26:40.975 --> 26:43.227
Sam, let's go.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.950
Sam. Sam, come on.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.786
Come on.

27:51.462 --> 27:54.340
Come on. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.551
-How is he?
-He just needed a little rest, that's all.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.803
How are you?

28:42.930 --> 28:44.849
I'll survive.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.147
Hey, you don't think we were
followed here, do you?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.232
I don't know. I don't think so.

28:53.482 --> 28:56.861
I mean, we couldn't have found
a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.612
Yeah.

29:02.783 --> 29:08.914
Hey, Dean, you--

29:12.001 --> 29:14.503
You saved my life back there.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.007
So I guess you're glad
I brought the gun, huh?

29:19.842 --> 29:22.261
Man, I'm trying to thank you here.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.807
You're welcome.

29:38.068 --> 29:41.030
-Hey, Sam.
SAM: Yeah?

29:41.238 --> 29:43.532
You know that guy I shot?

29:44.867 --> 29:46.702
There was a person in there.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.918
You didn't have a choice, Dean.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.296
Yeah, I know.
That's not what bothers me.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.050
Then what does?

30:05.054 --> 30:08.015
Killing that guy, killing Meg...

30:09.975 --> 30:13.020
...I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.

30:16.065 --> 30:20.319
I mean, for you or Dad, the things
I'm willing to do or kill, it's just....

30:23.280 --> 30:25.616
It scares me sometimes.

30:34.124 --> 30:37.586
It shouldn't. You did good.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.006
You're not mad?

30:41.882 --> 30:44.969
-For what?
-Using a bullet.

30:46.929 --> 30:50.057
Mad? I'm proud of you.

30:51.976 --> 30:56.272
You know, Sam and I,
we can get pretty obsessed.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.900
But you-- You--

31:00.150 --> 31:03.696
You watch out for this family.
You always have.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.246
Thanks.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.135
-It found us. It's here.
-The demon.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.054
Sam, lines of salt.
In front of every window, every door.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.098
-I already did it.
-Well, check it.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.267
-Okay?
-Okay.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.102
-Dean, you got the gun?
-Yeah.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.605
-Give it to me.
-Sam tried to shoot the demon...

31:37.688 --> 31:39.982
-...and it vanished.
-This is me. I won't miss.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.151
Now, the gun. Hurry.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.199
Son, please.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.418
Give me the gun. What are you doing?

31:59.668 --> 32:01.170
-He'd be furious.
-What?

32:01.378 --> 32:02.796
That I wasted a bullet.

32:03.797 --> 32:06.800
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.351
You're not my dad.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.148
Dean, it's me.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.777
I know my dad better than anyone,
and you aint him.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.861
What the hell's gotten into you?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.405
I could ask you the same thing.
Stay back.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.283
Dean. What the hell's going on?

32:31.492 --> 32:33.160
Your brother's lost his mind.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.204
-He's not Dad.
-What?

32:35.454 --> 32:38.874
I think he's possessed. He's been
possessed since we rescued him.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.834
-Don't listen.
-Dean, how do you know?

32:41.085 --> 32:44.046
-He's-- He's different.
-You know, we don't have time for this.

32:44.254 --> 32:47.758
Sam, you wanna kill this demon,
you gotta trust me.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.516
Sam.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.191
No.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.194
No.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.497
Fine.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.792
You're both so sure.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.211
Go ahead.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.548
Kill me.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.064
I thought so.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.207
What a pain in the ass
this thing's been.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.253
It's you, isn't it?

34:08.130 --> 34:11.884
-We've been looking for you a long time.
-Well, you found me.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.677
But the holy water....

34:13.886 --> 34:16.847
You think something like that
works on something like me?

34:22.102 --> 34:23.395
I'm gonna kill you.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.399
Oh, that would be a neat trick.

34:27.691 --> 34:31.153
In fact, here.

34:31.403 --> 34:35.199
Make the gun float to you there,
psychic boy.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.626
You know, this is fun.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.589
I could've killed you
a hundred times today, but this--

34:52.549 --> 34:54.009
This is worth the wait.

34:59.014 --> 35:03.018
Your dad, he's in here with me.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.270
Trapped inside his own meat suit.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.731
He says hi, by the way.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.942
He's gonna tear you apart.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.823
-He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
-Let him go.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.200
-Or I swear to God--
-What?

35:18.283 --> 35:21.078
What are you and God gonna do?

35:22.287 --> 35:26.333
You see, as far as I'm concerned,
this is justice.

35:31.547 --> 35:34.591
You know that little exorcism
of yours?

35:35.676 --> 35:38.095
That was my daughter.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.139
-Who, Meg?
-The one in the alley...

35:43.183 --> 35:45.310
...that was my boy.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.105
You understand?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.065
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What?

35:50.274 --> 35:52.150
You're the only one
that can have a family?

35:52.985 --> 35:55.821
You destroyed my children.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.574
How would you feel if
I killed your family?

36:04.162 --> 36:07.833
Oh, that's right.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.501
I forgot, I did.

36:13.213 --> 36:16.842
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.

36:18.051 --> 36:21.305
-You son of a bitch.
-I wanna know why.

36:22.431 --> 36:25.475
-Why did you do it?
-You mean, why did I kill Mommy...

36:25.684 --> 36:27.686
-...and pretty little Jess?
-Yeah.

36:30.063 --> 36:34.318
You know, I never told you this, but
Sam was gonna ask her to marry him.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.363
Been shopping for rings
and everything.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.491
You wanna know why?

36:42.284 --> 36:44.328
-They got in the way.
-In the way of what?

36:44.411 --> 36:46.830
My plans for you, Sammy.

36:46.914 --> 36:51.001
You and all of the children like you.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.464
Listen, you mind just
getting this over with, huh?

36:55.672 --> 36:58.717
-I really can't stand the monologuing.
-Funny.

36:58.926 --> 37:01.178
But that's all part of
your m.o., isn't it?

37:01.386 --> 37:05.265
Masks all that nasty pain.
Masks the truth.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.643
Oh, yeah? What's that?

37:07.851 --> 37:11.521
You know, you fight and you fight
for this family, but the truth is...

37:11.730 --> 37:13.941
...they don't need you.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.361
Not like you need them.

37:19.529 --> 37:23.408
Sam, he's clearly John's favorite.

37:24.534 --> 37:29.289
Even when they fight, it's more concern
than he's ever shown you.

37:32.042 --> 37:35.337
I'll bet you're real proud
of your kids too, huh?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.673
Oh, wait, I forgot.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.716
I wasted them.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.775
Dean.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.444
No!

38:03.824 --> 38:06.284
Dad. Dad.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.706
-Dad.
-Dad.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.375
Don't you let it kill me.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.420
Dean!

38:29.474 --> 38:30.851
Dad, please.

38:39.735 --> 38:41.319
Dean!

38:42.487 --> 38:45.198
-No! Don't!
-Stop.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.952
Stop it.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.464
You kill me, you kill Daddy.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.049
I know.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.896
Dean. Dean. Hey.

39:16.146 --> 39:18.106
Oh, God. You lost a lot of blood.

39:18.315 --> 39:19.900
-Where's Dad?
-He's right here.

39:20.150 --> 39:23.278
-He's right here, Dean.
-Go check on him.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.655
-Dean.
-Go check on him.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.083
Dad.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.668
Dad.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.464
Sammy! It's still alive.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.674
It's inside me. I can feel it.

39:44.758 --> 39:47.010
Just shoot me. You shoot me.

39:47.344 --> 39:50.305
You shoot me in the heart, son.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.266
-Do it now!
-Sam, don't you do it. Don't you do it.

39:53.475 --> 39:56.394
You gotta hurry.
I can't hold onto it much longer.

39:56.645 --> 39:59.606
Just shoot me, son. Shoot me!

40:00.190 --> 40:04.069
Son, I'm begging you.
We can end this, here and now.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.404
Sammy!

40:06.905 --> 40:10.492
-Sam, no.
-You do this!

40:11.827 --> 40:13.245
Sammy!

40:14.871 --> 40:16.456
Sam.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.544
(SCREAMS)

40:54.077 --> 40:55.495
(SIGH)

40:58.582 --> 41:01.585
Look, just hold on alright? The hospital
is only ten minutes away.

41:03.587 --> 41:07.132
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?

41:08.049 --> 41:11.303
I thought we saw eye to eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.597
Before me, before everything.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.934
No, sir.

41:18.727 --> 41:19.936
Not before everything.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.190
Look, we still got the Colt.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.151
We still have the one bullet left.

41:26.234 --> 41:29.905
We should start over, all right? I mean,
we already found the demon once--
