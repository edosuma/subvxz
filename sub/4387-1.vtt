<i>- Come on!
- Out!</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:26.600
<i>And here we go.</i>

00:26.700 --> 00:31.100
<i>Aaron Williams, one point away from
ending this outrageous seven-day match.</i>

00:31.500 --> 00:34.100
<i>On this, his 67th match point.</i>

00:35.400 --> 00:37.400
<i>He can end it all with one serve.</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:43.600
<i>Oh. 
A weak 30-mph serve into the net.</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:47.500
<i>Seven days of play really taking
its toll on everyone here.</i>

00:48.300 --> 00:50.900
<i>Please end it.
Please end it.</i>

00:53.500 --> 00:54.900
Fuck, no.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.100
- Jesus.
- Oh, this is killing me.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.500
The Williams-Poole match.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.700
It wasn't even a match. It was...
It was something else.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.800
It was two men stuck in eternal flames.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.100
<i>- Deuce.</i>
- Yeah, I know it's deuce.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.800
We all know it's deuce, man.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.300
It was...
seven days in hell.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.800
<i>It was the most spectacular
match in tennis history.</i>

01:27.500 --> 01:30.400
<i>But to fully understand
how these two men got here,</i>

01:30.800 --> 01:33.100
<i>we must first know where they came from.</i>

01:38.400 --> 01:40.600
Aaron Williams, thank you
for sitting down with us.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.400
- My pleasure.
- You're known as the "bad boy" of tennis.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.400
No. You know what?
Fuck this and fuck you.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.300
<i>Aaron Williams does not play "country club"
tennis because he's from the streets.</i>

01:51.400 --> 01:54.300
I mean, literally.
He was left on a street by his mother

01:54.400 --> 01:56.700
and then was adopted by Richard Williams,

01:56.700 --> 01:58.400
<i>father of Serena and Venus.</i>

01:58.900 --> 02:01.700
Well, with Aaron
it was a reverse "Blind Side."

02:01.700 --> 02:05.800
You know, a rich white family gets a
black kid and makes him play football.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.100
Well, we flipped it.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.199
<i>My dad, he took a white kid
and made him play tennis.</i>

02:10.400 --> 02:13.800
<i>Like his sisters, Aaron quickly
rose to the top of the game.</i>

02:14.100 --> 02:16.400
<i>But the number-one ranking eluded him.</i>

02:16.500 --> 02:18.400
<i>His personal life, however,</i>

02:18.400 --> 02:20.700
<i>has shined bright since his arrival to fame.</i>

02:20.700 --> 02:22.600
<i>We could go months without talking to him.</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:27.200
He'd hang around a lot in Vegas, spending a lot
of time with Rod Stewart and some magician.

02:27.500 --> 02:32.500
Well, it was me, Aaron Williams and Rod Stewart
going out every night for about 10 years,

02:32.700 --> 02:34.600
crushing pussy and making money.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.200
<i>Aaron's chance to become the
top-ranked player in the world</i>

02:41.200 --> 02:44.000
<i>finally came at the '96 Wimbledon finals.</i>

02:44.000 --> 02:46.200
<i>What happened at Wimbledon '96</i>

02:46.200 --> 02:49.300
completely changed the trajectory
of Aaron Williams' life.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.400
<i>Will he do it? At 25 years old
finally win Wimbledon and grab</i>

02:53.400 --> 02:56.100
<i>that number-one ranking he so desires?</i>

02:56.500 --> 02:59.600
<i>Can he do it?
Can he beat the Belgian, Jens Goossens?</i>

03:02.400 --> 03:03.600
<i>Ace.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:06.300
<i>- Three points away now.
- Here comes the guitar.</i>

03:07.900 --> 03:09.700
<i>He is gunning for that title.</i>

03:10.200 --> 03:11.800
<i>- 30-love.
- Another ace.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
<i>Are you kidding me?
148 miles per hour.</i>

03:15.200 --> 03:17.200
<i>He's like, on another planet right now.</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:23.200
After those three aces,
there wasn't one person

03:23.200 --> 03:25.300
who didn't think that
a four-bagger was coming.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.900
And with it, a new tennis champion.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.700
<i>But what came next was
something quite different.</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:37.300
<i>Here we go.
Championship point.</i>

03:37.700 --> 03:39.600
<i>It appears he just whispered to himself,</i>

03:39.700 --> 03:41.300
<i>"This is how we do it."</i>

03:41.300 --> 03:45.200
<i>The hit Montell Jordan song that Aaron
sung backup vocals on this year.</i>

03:47.900 --> 03:50.200
<i>Oh!
Oh, jeez.</i>

03:52.000 --> 03:53.400
<i>This is not good.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:55.800
<i>We just hope he's all right.</i>

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
You knew right away he was dead.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.400
<i>My Lord, I've never seen anything like this.</i>

04:03.400 --> 04:05.800
<i>It was one of the great
tragedies of all time</i>

04:05.900 --> 04:08.600
and, technically,
it wasn't the impact that killed him.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.800
But the impact gave him a heart
attack and that killed him.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.100
<i>So if you ask me, did Aaron kill him?</i>

04:14.700 --> 04:16.700
I'd say kinda.

04:16.899 --> 04:19.000
The silver lining to that man's death

04:19.100 --> 04:22.800
is that Aaron had set a...
a new speed record <i>for a serve.</i>

04:23.700 --> 04:26.200
<i>If the pressure of winning
Wimbledon wasn't enough,</i>

04:26.400 --> 04:28.500
<i>now he's got a dead body on his hands.</i>

04:28.800 --> 04:31.900
<i>Aaron probably should have
forfeited after killing a guy.</i>

04:32.300 --> 04:34.400
But he didn't because he's an asshole.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.300
<i>Second serve now, after killing a man.</i>

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
<i>Not a good sign for Williams.</i>

04:50.400 --> 04:52.200
<i>Aaron lost, but remarkably,</i>

04:52.300 --> 04:55.200
<i>killing a man and losing his
greatest shot at Wimbledon</i>

04:55.200 --> 04:59.300
<i>and the number-one ranking still wasn't
as low as he would sink that day.</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
<i>Let us start with a moment of silence</i>

05:03.400 --> 05:06.700
for Chauncey Kensington,

05:06.900 --> 05:09.800
who gave his life for the game of tennis.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.000
And now let's hear it for the runner-up,

05:19.200 --> 05:20.900
Aaron Williams.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.100
Thanks.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.600
Man, sorry I couldn't win today.
I thought I was gonna, but...

05:30.900 --> 05:33.100
I didn't murder him.
He had a heart attack.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.000
Great. Well, you know what?
I hate all of you too.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.900
I hate this stupid-ass country.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.500
The food's terrible.
There's no hot chicks.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.600
I've seen maybe two, max,
and they were, like, "sixes" at best.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.600
Even then, they'd be way lower

05:47.600 --> 05:49.300
if you put them in an L.A. or Miami

05:49.400 --> 05:51.800
or even a San Francisco!
<i>- This is an outrage...</i>

05:51.900 --> 05:53.300
Get out of my fucking way!

05:53.400 --> 05:54.700
He pushed the duke.

05:54.700 --> 05:59.100
You don't shove a member of the royal family
unless your brain is made of toddings.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.000
Sorry for my language.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.100
<i>It was the push heard round the world.</i>

06:11.400 --> 06:14.100
The Duke of Kent has been pushed.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.300
Later, tennis.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.400
<i>I mean, no one actually thought</i>

06:23.400 --> 06:25.700
he was saying goodbye to tennis for good,
because

06:25.800 --> 06:28.100
that's a crazy thing to say when retiring.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.900
"Later, tennis"?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.500
<i>After this dramatic exit, he vanished.</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:36.700
<i>And it seemed that would be the last
anyone would hear from Aaron Williams.</i>

06:38.800 --> 06:40.400
<i>No one could know that he would return</i>

06:40.500 --> 06:44.100
<i>to compete in the longest and arguably
greatest game in tennis history.</i>

06:45.200 --> 06:46.800
<i>Fuck, no!</i>

06:47.600 --> 06:50.900
<i>His competitor in the
match was Charles Poole.</i>

06:53.200 --> 06:56.900
<i>When you're a child prodigy,
the cameras start filming early.</i>

06:56.900 --> 06:58.700
<i>His name is Charles Lloyd Poole,</i>

06:58.700 --> 07:02.800
<i>and at three years of age, he's
only got the entire tennis world talking.</i>

07:02.900 --> 07:05.700
You've got to be the best, Charles.
The best.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.500
Mummy won't love you if you're second best.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.100
<i>He's clearly one to watch.</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:14.300
<i>If you like tennis,</i>

07:14.400 --> 07:16.700
you will certainly like my next guest.

07:17.300 --> 07:22.400
It is the <i> wunderkind,</i> Charles Lloyd Poole.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.300
Welcome to "Good Sport."

07:31.300 --> 07:34.600
The rooftops of London have been a-flutter

07:35.100 --> 07:37.700
with talk that you may be turning pro

07:38.000 --> 07:41.400
- before turning 16.
- Indubitably.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.300
It would make you
the youngest pro in history.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.100
Oh, yeah, indubitably.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.400
<i>It was pretty obvious
someone had taught this kid</i>

07:49.400 --> 07:51.200
the word, "indubitably,"

07:51.300 --> 07:53.800
<i>thinking that mixed with his English accent,</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:55.500
<i>it'd make him sound smart.</i>

07:55.600 --> 07:59.700
Charles was by far the
thickest person I ever met.

07:59.700 --> 08:03.300
<i>It was like talking to a
child with brain damage.</i>

08:03.500 --> 08:07.800
His mother wanted him to turn pro so badly
that she found a shortcut for schooling.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.200
<i>She sent him to a vocation school that
taught him to be a bloody lorry driver.</i>

08:12.600 --> 08:15.100
I must say, you are looking extremely fit.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.000
Would you mind lifting...
Lifting your shirt so...

08:19.100 --> 08:23.000
So we can inspect the abdominal muscles?

08:23.300 --> 08:24.600
Oh, yeah, indubitably.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.800
It was also obvious the host of "Good Sport"
was interested in him sexually.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.299
I'm not entirely sure that camera

08:42.100 --> 08:43.299
<i>got that.</i>

08:45.000 --> 08:46.300
Crackerjack.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.900
Well, Caspian Wint could be a bit
of a rapscallion.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.800
That guy was a creep.
Nobody liked him.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.700
Why do you smell like fire?

08:54.800 --> 08:57.700
Because I rage inside, like a furnace.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.100
And d-do you have a g... a girlfriend?

09:03.800 --> 09:06.600
No, but I did have one once.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.100
He was always really sweet and properly fit.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
And I know he really did love me.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.700
But, you know, my modeling
career was just pff-ff!

09:17.400 --> 09:21.600
Besides, even if I had wanted more,
there was just no getting past his mum.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.100
<i>She was an iron fortress around him.</i>

09:25.200 --> 09:27.600
Are you scared of your mother?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.200
No. No, of course not.
I... I love my mum.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.100
I'm not scared of her.
I'm not scared of my mum at all.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.500
Charles... is your mother

09:37.800 --> 09:40.800
using you for her

09:41.200 --> 09:43.100
own dashed dreams?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.800
- Oh yeah, definitely.
- He's joking.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.600
<i>I always liked that Caspian Wint.</i>

09:53.800 --> 09:57.600
He and Charles always seemed to
have a very special connection.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.900
<i>Two years after walking off
the court, Aaron Williams</i>

10:03.900 --> 10:07.000
<i>finally resurfaced...
In Sweden, of all places...</i>

10:07.100 --> 10:10.300
<i>To become the top of his game
once again at a new endeavor.</i>

10:51.600 --> 10:53.500
Uh, hmm?
Yeah?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
Yeah.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.800
<i>"Den Swedish Hit Show."</i>

11:04.200 --> 11:06.300
No...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
<i>Here comes the guitar.</i>

11:17.000 --> 11:21.500
<i>I don't think there's anyone in the world who
doesn't want to have sex with Aaron Williams.</i>

11:25.400 --> 11:28.900
<i>With the success of his underwear line
and clearly not missing tennis at all,</i>

11:28.900 --> 11:31.400
<i>it seemed Aaron had landed back on his feet,</i>

11:31.500 --> 11:34.700
<i>but beneath him was again, black ice.</i>

11:46.300 --> 11:49.100
<i>Aaron was hit with thousands
of malpractice lawsuits.</i>

11:49.300 --> 11:53.300
<i>A Swedish judge ordered him to pay
$12 million in class action fines or</i>

11:53.500 --> 11:56.000
<i>face a decade in Swedish jail.</i>

11:56.100 --> 11:58.800
The Swedish courtroom sketches
were just magnificent.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.600
They looked like a wonderful Disney film.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.200
<i>Those remarkable sketches
were inspired by this man,</i>

12:05.700 --> 12:09.000
<i>Jan Erik Eckland, a major
fan of Disney films</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:12.500
<i>and a prominent Swedish courtroom
artist in the late 1950s.</i>

12:12.600 --> 12:17.200
Every courtroom artist coming
up after 1955 will tell you

12:17.300 --> 12:19.600
<i>they got in the game because
of Jan Erik Eckland.</i>

12:19.700 --> 12:24.900
<i>Before Jan Erik Eckland, Swedish courtroom
sketches looked like any other courtroom sketch.</i>

12:25.100 --> 12:29.400
Jan Erik said, "I want to do something
different. I want to do something fun."

12:29.400 --> 12:33.200
He comes along and turns the dull
settings into fantastical worlds

12:33.300 --> 12:37.700
<i>complete with anthropomorphic
animals and magical beings.</i>

12:38.000 --> 12:41.800
<i>Jan Erik inspired courtroom
artists all over the world</i>

12:41.900 --> 12:44.900
<i>and began a renaissance
of courtroom sketching.</i>

12:46.100 --> 12:50.200
<i>And there are certain perks that come with
being at the forefront of your industry.</i>

12:50.300 --> 12:52.400
Jan Erik is driving fancy cars,

12:52.400 --> 12:55.200
<i>sleeping with gorgeous women.
He owns a biplane.</i>

12:55.300 --> 12:57.000
This guy was on top of the world.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.800
<i>The only thing left for Jan
Erik Eckland wasn't on Earth.</i>

13:01.100 --> 13:02.700
So he built this rocket ship.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.000
<i>He said, "I'm gonna find a new planet</i>

13:05.000 --> 13:08.600
<i>with better food and prettier
women and crazier drugs."</i>

13:09.600 --> 13:12.400
<i>The rocket blew up on launch.</i>

13:20.900 --> 13:25.000
So Aaron owed $12 million
to the Swedish government

13:25.200 --> 13:27.700
and his inability to come up with the funds

13:27.700 --> 13:31.500
led him into a pit of despair, AKA, PCP.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.900
Boogie, boogie, boogie.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
Nobody wants to end up in prison.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.800
But if you do end up in prison,
Swedish prison's the way to go.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.100
<i>It's a lot like living in a very
modern home with mid-century finishes.</i>

13:51.500 --> 13:56.500
<i>And once again, people assumed that was the
last they would ever hear of Aaron Williams.</i>

14:01.100 --> 14:04.000
So, Charles, you're now
number two in the world.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.900
You're favored to win Wimbledon,
which would make you number one.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.200
How do you do it?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.500
Yeah, well, when I'm playing

14:10.700 --> 14:13.000
I serve the ball and the man

14:13.800 --> 14:17.200
opposite me on the other side of
the court, he plays it back to me.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.500
Now, then I

14:19.500 --> 14:22.600
try to hit to a place in the
court that he's not standing in anymore.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.400
And if he manages to reach
that and play it back,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.700
if it lands short, I run forward

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
and then I try and get it to another place
in the court that he's not standing anymore.

14:32.100 --> 14:36.200
And sometimes it goes outside of these
lines on the side of the court.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.100
And if that happens, the ump,
he shouts, "Out!"

14:39.200 --> 14:41.900
And that's... that's very
bad if that happens to me.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.700
But if it happens to the other
player, I really like that.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.100
I understand how the game
of tennis is played.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.200
I guess I meant, what's
your overall strategy?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.800
Yeah, yeah.
Indubitably, yeah.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.200
Okay.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.600
You know, Charles, you...
you can't help but compare your

14:58.900 --> 15:01.200
<i>career to that of Aaron Williams.</i>

15:01.200 --> 15:03.600
And I think it's fair to
say there's been a debate

15:03.700 --> 15:06.000
<i>about who's the better player.
Would you say</i>

15:06.100 --> 15:07.400
it's you?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.200
Yeah.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.300
<i>That sheepish comment unexpectedly
made it halfway around the world...</i>

15:17.600 --> 15:19.400
<i>To an all-male orgy.</i>

15:30.500 --> 15:32.400
<i>Would you say it's you?</i>

15:33.400 --> 15:36.500
Yeah.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.700
<i>And with a seemingly innocuous statement
that should have gone unnoticed...</i>

15:49.700 --> 15:52.900
- Yeah.
- <i> Charles awoke a sleeping dragon.</i>

16:27.500 --> 16:32.100
<i>Despite the escaped convict, Charles' fate
to be world number one seemed predetermined.</i>

16:32.500 --> 16:37.000
<i>But would it come at the following Grand
Slam, on his home court at Wimbledon?</i>

16:42.300 --> 16:43.900
<i>An Englishman hadn't won Wimbledon</i>

16:43.900 --> 16:46.100
since Fred Perry in 1937,

16:46.100 --> 16:49.500
so there was tremendous pressure on
Charles to bring the trophy home.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.200
I mean, can you imagine?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, thank you so much.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.900
Yeah.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.400
Yeah, goodbye, ma'am.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.600
- That was the Queen.
<i>- What did she want?</i>

17:04.800 --> 17:06.200
She wanted me to win.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.300
<i>With the weight of an
entire nation on his back,</i>

17:09.400 --> 17:12.800
<i>Charles stepped up his
training to a diabolical level.</i>

17:26.900 --> 17:30.200
<i>Winning the seven matches necessary
to bring the trophy home to England</i>

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
<i>seemed nothing more than protocol.</i>

17:32.400 --> 17:35.300
<i>Until an unexpected guest showed up.</i>

17:38.300 --> 17:40.400
No one expected Aaron
to come back to tennis.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.500
I mean, he got that awful tattoo.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.100
<i>No one pictured Aaron Williams
back on a tennis court</i>

17:45.400 --> 17:48.900
<i>until a young PR man at the
All England Club had an idea.</i>

17:49.200 --> 17:52.200
The All England Club is allowed to
admit players through a wild card.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.700
So I proposed we let Aaron play
for the press it would bring.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.100
I did not like the proposal one bit.

18:00.900 --> 18:05.300
The duke was furious upon hearing the name,
but cooler heads prevailed when I assured him

18:05.300 --> 18:08.000
Aaron would lose badly
after not playing for years.

18:08.100 --> 18:12.700
Not to mention we would have him lose to an
Englishman who was certain to humiliate him.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.800
<i>That Englishman was obviously
Charles Lloyd Poole.</i>

18:26.900 --> 18:29.900
Every tennis fan had been
dying for these two to play.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.800
<i>It was a guaranteed, epic match.</i>

18:37.700 --> 18:39.700
Not to mention all the trim it would bring.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.400
The second they entered the stadium, all
the girls would just soak their socks.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.100
<i>Jesus.</i>

18:48.700 --> 18:55.100
<i>Just moments ago, the first to walk onto Centre Court and
prepare to open play for this fortnight at Wimbledon...</i>

18:55.400 --> 18:57.800
<i>Oh, my God.
He appears to be wearing</i>

18:57.800 --> 19:00.100
<i>some kind of sleeveless,
denim button-down.</i>

19:00.100 --> 19:02.300
<i>Pros are sponsored and given clothes.</i>

19:02.300 --> 19:05.800
Here's the problem, though.
No one wanted to give Aaron an endorsement

19:06.200 --> 19:08.500
until Jordache decided to get in the game.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.300
The spirit of Jordache
is one of experimentation.

19:13.900 --> 19:18.000
If I dig that shit, I think the
customer's gonna dig that shit.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.300
That white denim has to go down as
the all-time worst tennis outfit.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.800
I liked his hair and he
looked good in the jeans.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.300
<i>End of story.</i>

19:27.100 --> 19:29.300
Look, in the first rounds of any tournament,

19:29.300 --> 19:33.300
you have top-seeded guys playing low-ranked
guys and there's rarely a surprise.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.400
<i>And the start of the
Williams-Poole match</i>

19:40.500 --> 19:42.400
seemed to be going accordingly.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.100
The guy was 30.
He hadn't played in years.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
<i>It looks like he's never
played tennis before.</i>

19:51.600 --> 19:53.300
<i>The guy's just dying out there.</i>

19:54.400 --> 19:57.700
He looked like an old, faded drug addict.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.700
Which is what he was.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.200
<i>Charles effortlessly destroyed Aaron</i>

20:02.200 --> 20:05.100
<i>in the first set in an
unprecedented 21 minutes.</i>

20:05.400 --> 20:07.200
<i>It was on course to be over soon.</i>

20:07.400 --> 20:09.400
<i>But the weather had other plans.</i>

20:09.600 --> 20:13.600
Look! It's raining. We have to stop.
We have to stop. It's raining.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.200
<i>We'll have to continue this match tomorrow.</i>

20:17.300 --> 20:19.900
<i>If you want to catch the end,
be sure to tune in on time</i>

20:19.900 --> 20:21.600
<i>because it won't last long.</i>

20:21.900 --> 20:25.400
He played so bad, Jordache
pulled its sponsorship.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.700
Thank God.

20:26.700 --> 20:30.000
We lost a lot of money with that
endorsement, and I lost my job.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.500
But I sell pianos now.
I fucking love it.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.500
<i>The scoreboard said it all.</i>

20:34.700 --> 20:37.400
<i>And the battle would
conclude the following day.</i>

20:37.700 --> 20:39.100
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

20:40.800 --> 20:44.300
What happened the second day was
nothing short of a miracle.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.100
<i>- Another winner from Aaron.</i>
- Yeah!

20:53.800 --> 20:57.400
<i>- This guy has been totally reborn.
- It's like riding a bike.</i>

20:57.800 --> 21:00.100
It just clicked for him on that second day.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.700
I couldn't see. Was it in?
Did it go in?

21:05.700 --> 21:07.200
- Yeah.
- <i> My point?</i>

21:07.300 --> 21:09.400
- Yeah, yeah, it went in. Your point.
- <i> Okay, cool.</i>

21:09.500 --> 21:12.500
And that confidence gave him
a huge burst of energy.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.800
<i>It looks like Aaron's having some
fun with the line judge out there.</i>

21:15.800 --> 21:21.400
<i>But others suspected that burst of energy was
from something much more illicit than confidence.</i>

21:21.700 --> 21:26.200
It was pretty obvious that he had
hidden cocaine in his water bottles...

21:27.800 --> 21:29.200
and in his rackets...

21:30.900 --> 21:32.600
and in his coke necklace.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.900
And even on the lines of the court.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.600
<i>Seems crazy now, but you gotta remember</i>

21:41.600 --> 21:43.500
this is before cocaine was illegal.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.800
<i>- Cocaine was always illegal.</i>
- Really?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.500
Oh, we knew he was on cocaine.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.700
It's just that in England it's
very rude to point things out.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.500
<i>Whatever the reason for Aaron's
sudden energy and inspiration...</i>

21:59.600 --> 22:03.700
<i>It appears there's a bit of blood
on his wristband from his nose.</i>

22:04.000 --> 22:06.900
<i>It led to arguably the
greatest tennis of his life.</i>

22:07.100 --> 22:09.200
<i>The match was expected to end quickly.</i>

22:09.300 --> 22:12.900
<i>But Aaron's rally extended the game,
leaving it tied at two sets each.</i>

22:13.400 --> 22:17.000
<i>It would be the first match in
tennis history to go three days.</i>

22:20.200 --> 22:23.000
When I got in, there was a
message from the Queen.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.900
<i>Wow, the Queen of
England really wants you to win.</i>

22:42.600 --> 22:46.900
<i>- How are you dealing with the pressure?</i>
- Will you excuse me just... just for one second?

22:58.500 --> 23:03.000
You're experiencing something
that is the optimum in tennis.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.700
<i>The following day began
at the crack of dawn.</i>

23:12.800 --> 23:15.500
<i>And the play was again remarkable.</i>

23:22.200 --> 23:23.500
<i>What? Come on!</i>

23:29.600 --> 23:31.200
<i>How'd he get to that?</i>

23:33.100 --> 23:35.800
<i>Unbelievable.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

23:36.300 --> 23:38.700
<i>This is like nothing I've ever seen.</i>

23:42.800 --> 23:44.100
<i>Spectacular!</i>

23:44.200 --> 23:46.800
<i>Absolutely spectacular!</i>

23:53.100 --> 23:54.700
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

23:56.900 --> 23:59.100
<i>What? Come on!</i>

23:59.900 --> 24:03.400
<i>I'm gonna go ahead and call that the
greatest point in tennis history.</i>

24:03.800 --> 24:06.100
<i>In the fifth set of Wimbledon,
there's no tie break,</i>

24:06.100 --> 24:08.400
<i>so you play until one man wins by two games,</i>

24:08.600 --> 24:11.000
be it 8-6, or 9-7,

24:11.700 --> 24:14.200
or 10-8...
Or 11-9, for example.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.500
They could theoretically
play forever, which is scary

24:17.600 --> 24:20.400
for somebody like me who doesn't
much like watching tennis.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.000
<i>The match stretched on
for eight hours that day,</i>

24:23.100 --> 24:25.700
<i>but neither side was able to claim victory.</i>

24:56.300 --> 25:00.200
On day four, Aaron came out
completely depleted.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.800
Oh, Jesus Christ, easy.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
<i>His legs were like Jell-O,
just two little pudding pops.</i>

25:11.300 --> 25:13.500
<i>He's collapsed like a baby deer.</i>

25:14.200 --> 25:16.000
<i>No fight in his eyes.</i>

25:18.600 --> 25:20.100
- Out.
<i>- But just when it seemed.</i>

25:20.100 --> 25:21.900
<i>Aaron was on his last breath,</i>

25:21.900 --> 25:24.300
<i>he was granted a gift from the gods.</i>

25:24.400 --> 25:28.800
<i>Charles up a break, one point
awayfrom finally ending this.</i>

25:29.500 --> 25:31.700
<i>And now this match has it all.</i>

25:32.500 --> 25:35.000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a streaker.</i>

25:37.800 --> 25:39.900
<i>Looks like security has her now.</i>

25:41.100 --> 25:43.500
<i>Seems Aaron wants to take care
of the situation himself.</i>

25:43.600 --> 25:45.900
<i>He's holding his hand out
to calm the streaker.</i>

25:46.300 --> 25:48.300
<i>He's made eye contact with her.</i>

25:50.700 --> 25:52.900
<i>Whoa, whoa, what's going on down there?</i>

25:53.300 --> 25:55.600
<i>Whatever he said to her
was quite the line, Chris.</i>

25:55.600 --> 25:56.800
What's he doing to her?

25:56.800 --> 26:00.500
<i>It appears that Aaron is now
copulating with the random streaker.</i>

26:01.000 --> 26:02.800
Is no one gonna stop this?

26:02.800 --> 26:07.500
<i>You'd think that a player would be disqualified
for having sex on the court for over four hours, but</i>

26:07.600 --> 26:10.100
really, there's no rule in the book about it.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.400
So what could we do, but watch?

26:15.100 --> 26:19.500
<i>He went down on her for a solid hour at
least, the whole time high-fiving her.</i>

26:19.500 --> 26:23.100
It was like nothing I'd ever seen,
and I'm no stranger to adult films.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.000
<i>Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about.</i>

26:26.100 --> 26:27.700
<i>Quiet on the court, please.</i>

26:28.300 --> 26:32.000
<i>For Aaron, the streaker was a
life preserver in a sea of grass</i>

26:32.100 --> 26:35.700
<i>and he clung to her for dear life</i> -
<i>until he could no longer hang on.</i>

26:35.800 --> 26:38.000
<i>Are they clapping because
they're happy it's over</i>

26:38.000 --> 26:39.800
<i>or are they proud of his work?</i>

26:39.900 --> 26:43.700
<i>Hard to say, but it looks like we
might actually get back to tennis.</i>

26:45.300 --> 26:46.800
<i>Whoo!</i>

26:47.400 --> 26:49.000
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

26:49.400 --> 26:52.300
<i>We've got another streaker.
This one's a dude.</i>

26:53.400 --> 26:56.100
<i>It appears Aaron is not
as happy to see this guy.</i>

26:57.300 --> 26:58.600
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

26:59.200 --> 27:01.000
<i>It looks like he's gonna bone him too.</i>

27:07.900 --> 27:09.700
<i>They are having sex.</i>

27:10.700 --> 27:13.800
<i>Well, if you need to stall, this
is definitely one way to do it.</i>

27:15.300 --> 27:17.500
<i>They're letting out a harmonized moan now.</i>

27:17.700 --> 27:19.300
<i>These guys are really in sync.</i>

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
He... he came so hard,
it made a divot in the court.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.000
<i>Looks like they've finished up.</i>

27:26.900 --> 27:29.400
<i>The female streaker has returned for more.</i>

27:29.700 --> 27:32.500
<i>We've got three bodies, two of them naked.</i>

27:32.600 --> 27:35.000
<i>Oh, I think I know
how this is gonna pan out.</i>

27:35.100 --> 27:37.500
<i>And now Aaron is kissing
the female streaker.</i>

27:38.500 --> 27:40.300
<i>And now, the male streaker.</i>

27:41.100 --> 27:43.500
<i>And now he's making the two streakers kiss.</i>

27:44.400 --> 27:46.500
<i>The lovemaking lasted until nightfall</i>

27:46.800 --> 27:49.000
<i>and Aaron survived another day.</i>

27:53.300 --> 27:54.600
Good morning.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.800
Before I get started, I just want to say

27:57.000 --> 28:00.500
I'm not going to apologize
for the incidents in yesterday's match.

28:00.800 --> 28:05.200
What happens between two or three people
on the Wimbledon courts is between them.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.500
And it's natural and it's beautiful.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.900
That out of the way, as many of you know,

28:09.900 --> 28:13.200
I've spent years searching for the
true identity of my birth father.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.700
I'm an orphan.
Adopted.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.300
And...

28:17.400 --> 28:20.000
I'm happy to announce
that today I have found him.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.300
His name is England's own...

28:23.900 --> 28:26.000
Engelbert Humperdinck.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.400
And I'd like to hereby announce

28:28.400 --> 28:31.300
that my performance in this match

28:31.700 --> 28:34.000
will be dedicated to my native home

28:34.600 --> 28:36.200
of Great Britain.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.200
England's true son has returned!

28:39.400 --> 28:40.700
Whoo!

28:40.800 --> 28:42.000
See you on the court.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.700
Look, we all know this,
tennis is a head game.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.300
And it was a great move
to get in Charles' head.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.800
<i>I mean, the guy's whole identity</i>

28:49.800 --> 28:52.200
<i>was based on being the only
British star in the sport.</i>

28:52.200 --> 28:54.500
And suddenly, Aaron had taken that from him.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.800
<i>Game, Williams.</i>

28:58.600 --> 29:00.000
Go, Britain!

29:00.700 --> 29:02.000
He's a phony.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.500
<i>The crowd loves him.</i>

29:03.800 --> 29:06.600
I'm the one
who's English. Me.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.900
<i>Seems everyone's turned on Charles.</i>

29:08.900 --> 29:11.600
<i>By this point the English
had bloody had it with Charles</i>

29:11.600 --> 29:15.200
and they truly believed Aaron was
a Humperdinck. A brother-in-arms.

29:15.500 --> 29:19.100
<i>But the abuse directed at Charles
didn't end with the angry spectators.</i>

29:19.300 --> 29:23.800
<i>When he got back to his hotel, he was greeted
by a much more intimidating audience.</i>

29:56.700 --> 29:58.300
I'm British, eh!

30:08.800 --> 30:10.000
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

30:13.700 --> 30:16.400
Aaron Williams...
has been hit..

30:17.000 --> 30:18.300
By a <i> twuck.</i>

30:20.000 --> 30:22.200
Did something happen to Aaron Williams?

30:22.500 --> 30:25.000
- <i> He was hit by a truck.</i>
- He was hit by a truck?

30:25.900 --> 30:27.100
Oh, no.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.700
You have two men competing
in a high-stakes match.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.600
One of those men gets hit by a truck.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.100
The other man...
is a licensed big-rig truck driver.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.600
<i>But somehow</i>

30:40.800 --> 30:44.200
no one thinks to accuse
the guy who's a truck driver.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.700
I'm indubitably concerned about Aaron.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.400
It'd be a great shame
if he couldn't play again,

30:49.400 --> 30:52.500
and I advanced and my mum and
everyone liked me again.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.200
No comment.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.700
Against the advice of his doctors,
and anyone with eyeballs...

30:58.700 --> 31:02.400
Aaron Williams checked himself out
of his hospital this afternoon

31:02.600 --> 31:08.000
to continue his ludicrous,
now six-day match against Poole.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.200
This is not something to miss.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.800
<i>Aaron's right-handed and his right
arm is completely shattered.</i>

31:19.800 --> 31:23.700
So it's like, okay, you want to
keep playing, but with what arm?

31:25.700 --> 31:28.300
<i>It appears Williams is now going to attempt</i>

31:28.300 --> 31:30.800
<i>to continue this match with his left hand.</i>

31:31.100 --> 31:33.800
<i>I mean, this is just
an exercise in stupidity now.</i>

31:34.200 --> 31:35.900
<i>There's no way this works.</i>

31:42.300 --> 31:44.800
<i>A left-handed ace?
Are you kidding me?</i>

31:45.400 --> 31:47.100
<i>This guy can do anything.</i>

31:57.200 --> 32:00.600
<i>At this point, sports psychologists
explained it was entirely mental.</i>

32:00.800 --> 32:03.200
No man would ever break the
other's serve because, A...

32:03.300 --> 32:06.000
He didn't believe he could,
and, B... he didn't want to.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.600
They had both made a deal with
themselves that this is how

32:08.600 --> 32:10.500
they would spend the rest of their lives.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.000
And they were okay with that.
And so was I.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.400
<i>But in the 196th game of play,</i>

32:16.600 --> 32:19.300
<i>it seemed Charles was ready
to break that pattern.</i>

32:19.900 --> 32:22.400
<i>Up for the first time
at triple match break point,</i>

32:22.700 --> 32:26.300
<i>Charles had three opportunities
to put an end to the nightmare.</i>

32:27.300 --> 32:29.300
What happened in '98, '97,

32:29.300 --> 32:32.700
I would call the greatest
travesty in sports history.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.400
<i>Please end it.
Please end it.</i>

32:38.900 --> 32:41.500
<i>What the...?
What's going on?</i>

32:41.900 --> 32:43.600
<i>It's David Copperfield!</i>

32:43.700 --> 32:46.800
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
- At that point, you'd just seen it all.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.200
Aaron was in no way responsible.
It was simply a trick gone wrong.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.300
I was supposed to appear on
top of the Statue of Liberty.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.000
But sometimes these things just...
Well, they just happen.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.400
<i>Charles couldn't concentrate after that.</i>

33:02.600 --> 33:04.500
Playing at Wimbledon is hard enough

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
<i>then add on top of that all the pressure</i>

33:06.600 --> 33:10.000
<i>and fear that a magician might appear
on your shoulders at any time.</i>

33:10.400 --> 33:14.900
<i>Whatever it was that happened, it now seemed
the match would never reach a conclusion.</i>

33:15.100 --> 33:16.500
- <i>30-15.
- Until...</i>

33:26.700 --> 33:29.500
<i>Aaron, how are you feeling?</i>
- I feel great.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.300
I popped my shoulder back into place
"Lethal Weapon" style, so good to go there.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.600
And Charles didn't try and hit
me with his truck last night.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.200
<i>So that always helps.</i>

33:39.500 --> 33:42.000
<i>Charles, what are your
thoughts on the sex tape?</i>

33:42.100 --> 33:43.400
What sex tape?

33:43.500 --> 33:46.500
Ooh, you hadn't heard about that?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.300
What sex tape?

33:48.400 --> 33:50.000
<i>The one with Aaron and Lily.</i>

33:50.500 --> 33:52.700
- <i>Is it recording?
- Yeah, it's on.</i>

33:52.800 --> 33:54.000
It's going.

33:57.800 --> 34:01.400
One doesn't expect this type of
thing to be released to the public.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.800
It was... rather embarrassing.

34:03.900 --> 34:06.200
Not so much for me, but more for Aaron.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I empathize.
I've been there, you know?

34:27.900 --> 34:31.900
I am so disappointed that surfaced
today of all days, you know?

34:31.900 --> 34:33.800
I don't want to distract from the match.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.100
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

34:36.699 --> 34:38.500
It was his biggest secret.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.699
He started balding around 13.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.600
<i>If you're gonna wear a wig,</i>

34:45.699 --> 34:47.400
why would you wear <i>that</i> wig?

34:49.199 --> 34:52.300
If you are gonna wear a wig,
<i>that's</i> the one to wear.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.699
- Don't touch my hair, bro!
- Don't touch my bloody girl, mate!

34:55.800 --> 34:57.800
- You're dead, bro.
- You're dead, mate.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.200
Ugh!
- Get off of me, man!

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
- Get off of <i> me,</i> man.
- Get off of me, dude, bro.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.200
I'll see you on the court, mate, dude.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.300
- Get off!
- Get off. Get off!

35:14.700 --> 35:16.000
<i>Would you look at this?</i>

35:16.100 --> 35:19.900
<i>For the first time since 1977,
the Queen is back at Wimbledon.</i>

35:38.300 --> 35:40.200
You have taken everything from me,

35:40.500 --> 35:42.200
but you will not take this match!

35:42.400 --> 35:44.000
I'm taking your virginity next.

35:44.200 --> 35:47.000
<i>This is more of a street brawl
than a Sunday at Wimbledon.</i>

35:47.100 --> 35:49.600
<i>Finally the tension rose to a boiling point</i>

35:49.800 --> 35:52.100
<i>and the lid was knocked off the pot.</i>

35:52.700 --> 35:55.500
Yeah!
Come on, motherfucker!

35:55.600 --> 35:57.400
<i>- <b>Bring it.</b></i>
- Whoo!

36:00.700 --> 36:02.000
What did you just do?

36:02.500 --> 36:04.400
What'd I do?
I didn't do anything.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.600
I honestly didn't notice anything,

36:07.700 --> 36:09.900
but Charles clearly saw something.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.700
To me, a very clear, very well
done "pussy-eating" sign.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.100
<i>It did seem unintentional,
but knowing my brother,</i>

36:19.400 --> 36:21.600
I'd guess it was very <i> intentional.</i>

36:23.800 --> 36:26.700
Well, if Charles had actually
watched the provoking tape,

36:26.700 --> 36:28.500
he probably wouldn't have cared at all.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.600
<i>The one-two punch of
the sex tape with his girl</i>

36:30.600 --> 36:34.100
and whatever gesture he made, it
was more than Charles could take.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.100
- You want to fight me?
- I will rip you in half if you want to go.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.300
<i>This shouldn't be happening at Wimbledon.</i>
- Let's go.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.700
I'll rip you in half, mate.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.600
<i>This is not what you want to see.
</i> - I will rip you in half.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.000
No.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.600
Let them fight.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.900
And that was how it ended.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.000
They killed each other.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.200
<i>They lived to play each other.</i>

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
<i>They died playing each other.</i>

37:35.400 --> 37:38.600
You know, it only seemed right
that they be buried together

37:39.400 --> 37:40.900
in the same coffin.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.700
I've seen too many dead
bodies on the tennis court.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.500
<i>I would have spent more time with him, but</i>

37:58.300 --> 38:00.500
he was obsessed with tennis.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.900
<i>They were two of England's greatest sons.</i>

38:06.600 --> 38:09.800
Except for Aaron Williams,
who was not English.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.300
Aaron may have died,

38:17.400 --> 38:19.400
but his spirit lives on in all of us.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.500
That was perhaps his greatest trick.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.300
Actually, somebody
should say that at <i> my</i> funeral.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.500
That's the perfect thing to say about me.

38:32.100 --> 38:35.800
I really did love them both.
Charles was so dim.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.600
And Aaron was so bad at getting erect.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.400
It would have been incredibly tragic

38:44.400 --> 38:47.900
if these were football players
or basketball players.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.900
But it was tennis players.
Who cares?

38:56.800 --> 39:00.200
<i>Do you have any...
Any role models?</i>

39:01.800 --> 39:03.100
Oh, yes.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.300
I really look up to Aaron Williams.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.300
He's my favorite tennis player,

39:08.500 --> 39:10.300
and person of all time.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.600
You are a fascinating creature.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.000
<i>Charles Lloyd Poole.</i>

39:19.100 --> 39:20.700
Do you genuinely hate him?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.200
No, no.
I don't hate him.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.100
I mean, I respect the shit out of that kid.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.600
It seemed like I hate him,
sure, but hate, love,

39:32.100 --> 39:36.500
I mean, those are just two flip sides
of the same quesadilla,<i> amiga.</i>

39:38.400 --> 39:40.500
The great quesadilla in the sky.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.400
Yeah.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.900
If I die, that should be
the last shot, of my dock.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.800
I don't know what the word "strategy" means,
Bryant Gumbel.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.200
I'm not Bryant Gumbel.
I'm Soledad O'Brien.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.000
I'm at the wrong show.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.200
Putting a tennis player in denim was
the first in a series of bad choices

40:29.200 --> 40:30.900
that I made as president of Jordache.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.900
I sponsored a bunch of Mexican
guys who do cockfights.

40:33.900 --> 40:38.200
I started a JonBenét Ramsey line of denim,
after she died.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.500
How's it going?
- It's good.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.700
Like 25%.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.200
<i>I would presume</i>

40:45.300 --> 40:47.900
that there's only one way to grip a <i> wacket.</i>

40:48.600 --> 40:51.000
Oh, no, there's loads
of ways to grip a racket.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.700
- Do tell.
- You can hold it like this

40:54.300 --> 40:58.000
when you want to make
a big shot over the head.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.300
What if it's a very dirty handle?

41:02.200 --> 41:06.700
Last month you crashed
your Lamborghini Countach into your Viper.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.800
What happened?

41:07.900 --> 41:11.300
What's the PC way to say I got
fucked up with two Puerto Ricans?

41:11.500 --> 41:12.800
There really isn't one.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.100
I got fucked up with two Puerto Ricans.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.900
- Bro, bro.
- Mate, mate.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.900
- Bro, bro.
- Mate, mate.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.900
Mate!

41:23.700 --> 41:26.700
<i>I actually heard that they dropped
the coffin into the sewer.</i>

41:26.800 --> 41:29.200
A friend of mine didn't believe it.
I did believe it.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.200
I thought that sounds about right.

41:31.400 --> 41:35.100
<i>- How are you dealing with the pressure?</i>
- Just got to get a sip of water.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.700
<i>What's wrong with this kid?</i>

41:55.400 --> 41:58.200
It was seven days in hell.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.300
<i>Why are you looking at the lens?</i>

42:01.400 --> 42:04.500
'Cause I think that would make a good title.
"Seven Days In Hell."
