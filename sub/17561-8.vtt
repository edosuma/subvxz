00:01.918 --> 00:03.294
-<i> Morning.</i>
-<i> Hi.</i>

00:03.378 --> 00:05.505
Today is the day I am gonna
ask Vic to be my date

00:05.588 --> 00:07.298
at the opening
of Jazz Night at the bakery.

00:07.382 --> 00:10.927
[gasps]
Really? You're really
gonna ask him?

00:11.010 --> 00:13.138
I know! I know!
Can you believe it?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.765
I mean, daddy was right. Life
is too short to play it safe.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.184
That's what
I told you like 85 times.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.103
Yeah, but he's my daddy.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.438
Can you believe it?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.231
It's all I needed was for
everything to make sense.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.066
Now it's all making sense
in my head.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.277
Everything's starting
to make sense now.

00:28.570 --> 00:32.782
My sister's about
to make you very happy!

00:32.866 --> 00:36.035
So, how are you
gonna make me very happy?

00:37.078 --> 00:40.457
- Well, uh, Vic..
- Yeah?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.792
- Um, I've been thinking.
- Uh-huh.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.629
And, um, what I've been
thinking about is..

00:47.881 --> 00:49.924
...buttermilk.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.134
I'm gonna go get some buttermilk

00:51.217 --> 00:53.553
and make those
pancakes you love.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.437
Oh, and, uh,
would you wanna go out

01:02.520 --> 01:04.605
with me tonight on a date?

01:11.279 --> 01:14.240
- I'd love to.
- Okay, bye.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.665
Hey!

02:05.124 --> 02:07.293
Chia boy.

02:07.377 --> 02:11.047
- Come here. Give me a little.
- Razor!

02:11.131 --> 02:12.715
- What? You don't like it?
- No.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.217
I saw you a day and a half ago.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.553
How did it grow so fast?

02:16.636 --> 02:19.472
There's a lot of man
happening up in here, baby.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.522
Ow!

02:27.605 --> 02:30.567
Your "lot of man" is hurting me.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.277
Plus, it doesn't go
with the new jacket

02:32.360 --> 02:34.195
I bought you for Jazz Night.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.072
See, it says right here
on the label.

02:36.155 --> 02:38.616
"Do not wear with a furry face."

02:38.700 --> 02:41.786
And you really got a furry..

02:41.870 --> 02:43.997
Is that peanut butter or hummus?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.167
Peanut butter.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.004
That was a good sandwich.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.755
See any jelly?

03:00.513 --> 03:03.182
Alright. Listen up, ladies.

03:03.266 --> 03:07.270
As you know, tonight is
the premiere of our Jazz Night.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.356
In an effort
to bring in a finer clientele

03:10.440 --> 03:13.443
I have created
a more upscale look.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.531
So if you would
please snap on these..

03:19.824 --> 03:21.618
...and do not spill
anything on them.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.121
For they are very classy
and cost me $4 a dozen.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.790
Here.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.752
[laughing]

03:30.835 --> 03:32.795
I don't think so.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.964
[laughing]

03:35.048 --> 03:36.925
I do think so.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.178
Yeah, see, honey,
these are the money, okay?

03:40.261 --> 03:42.639
I will not smother them
under man clothes.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.933
Besides, who made
you the boss of me?

03:45.016 --> 03:46.768
Val. Val promoted me to manager.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.979
Yeah, right. And then
what happened, you woke up?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.314
Liar!

03:51.397 --> 03:53.816
Val is like
an older sister to me.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.818
Why would she pick you over me?

03:55.902 --> 03:56.861
Oh, I-I don't know.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.571
Maybe because
I'm a business major

03:58.655 --> 04:00.281
Uh, I show up to work on time

04:00.365 --> 04:01.658
and I don't have a huge tab

04:01.741 --> 04:05.244
under the assumed name
of Miss Barb Mitzvah.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.539
Is it true?

04:08.623 --> 04:11.834
Did you promote Gary over me,
and if so, why?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.128
Well, Miss Mitzvah..

04:15.672 --> 04:17.339
Okay, just please tell me.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.550
How could I get
to be the boss of Gary?

04:19.634 --> 04:22.470
What do I have to do,
a little nookie with the owner?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.474
I'm a woman.
I know what you like.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.770
Well, I'll tell you
what you have to do.

04:30.853 --> 04:34.565
You have to start showing up on
time and actually working! Ah!

04:35.817 --> 04:37.902
What else you got?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.779
Well, I could tell you

04:39.862 --> 04:42.281
how I asked Vic out on a date.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.367
What? Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:44.450 --> 04:46.703
Well, what did he say?
Was he excited?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.496
Hey, does Gary know?

04:48.579 --> 04:51.290
Ha! You are so out of the loop!

04:52.875 --> 04:54.210
So, where are you guys going?

04:54.293 --> 04:56.087
Well, okay, how does this sound?

04:56.170 --> 04:58.756
I thought we would come
here for Jazz Night.

05:00.883 --> 05:01.759
And?

05:01.843 --> 05:03.886
- That's it.
- That's it?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.014
That's the big date we've
been waiting months for?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.182
You're bringing him to work?

05:09.350 --> 05:11.853
Well, yeah. It's Jazz Night.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.064
It's perfect,
it allows us to be on a date

05:15.148 --> 05:16.733
without sort of being on a date

05:16.816 --> 05:18.943
because, you know,
if it gets too datey

05:19.027 --> 05:21.487
with flowers and him
all picking me up and stuff

05:21.571 --> 05:23.072
then he's gonna start to think

05:23.156 --> 05:26.659
that this is the beginning
of the "Being in love" spiral.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.663
You know, one date, then another
date, and then another date

05:30.747 --> 05:32.206
and before you know it,
he's gonna wanna

05:32.290 --> 05:33.416
spend the night in my bed.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.043
Then it's a relationship
and that is when

05:35.126 --> 05:37.003
it all goes to hell.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.590
Interesting, do you
compare it to hell

05:40.673 --> 05:44.093
because it's all hot
and sweaty and kind of burns?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.268
Oh, hey! Dude!

05:52.351 --> 05:53.936
Furry dude!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.938
- You like it, huh?
- Yeah!

05:56.022 --> 05:58.608
- Huh?
- Ah!

05:58.691 --> 06:00.526
Well, it's coming off.
Holly hates it.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.028
Huh.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.113
[clicks tongue]

06:04.197 --> 06:07.241
So, uh, what are you gonna take
it off with, a Lady Schick?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.453
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, nothing.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.872
Come on,
I'm just saying, whipped!

06:14.373 --> 06:17.627
- Who's whipped?
- Nobody, you!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.629
Excuse me.
Are you saying I'm whipped?

06:19.712 --> 06:21.464
Totally.

06:21.547 --> 06:25.009
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I meant to say totally.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.303
I'm supposed to take
relationship advice from you?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.223
I mean, aren't you living with
your wife, who's not your wife

06:30.306 --> 06:33.142
who wants you to leave,
but you won't?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.812
Actually, you know what, you
should be taking advice from me

06:35.895 --> 06:38.689
because if I would have caved
and done what Val told me to do

06:38.773 --> 06:40.108
like shave my face

06:40.191 --> 06:42.819
my wife never would have
asked me out on a date tonight.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.320
- Get out!
- Ha ha!

06:44.403 --> 06:46.489
That's right, junior.
That's right.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.243
A date with my beautiful wife
to Jazz Night!

06:52.495 --> 06:55.164
So, what you're saying, my man.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.958
I shouldn't shave my beard.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.545
I'm just saying, if you
like it, you should keep it.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.758
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.426
- Yeah, I'm not shaving.
- No.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.719
- 'Cause I'm a man.
- Yeah.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.304
- Men are cool!
- Yeah!

07:10.388 --> 07:11.973
I love men!

07:19.480 --> 07:20.857
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!

07:20.940 --> 07:23.359
- These are for you.
- Oh, oh, flowers..

07:23.442 --> 07:24.861
- How sweet.
- Yeah.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.029
Uh, you're a little early
for our date

07:27.113 --> 07:29.365
like, oh, three hours.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.659
I am not here
for our date tonight.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.704
We are going on a date tonight.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.372
Yeah, I know,
but don't tell Gary.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.708
We're keeping him
out of the loop.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.251
So, listen, I was thinking

07:40.334 --> 07:42.962
since you asked me out
on a date, I'd reciprocate.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.547
So, what do you think
about a little drive out

07:44.630 --> 07:46.674
to the Hamptons on Sunday?

07:46.757 --> 07:48.593
So-so-so another date.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.553
Oh, another date.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.931
We-well, the-the Hamptons thing,
that's another date, right?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.726
Uh, yeah, because we're dating.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.730
Hmm. No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.190
See, we're just going on a date.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.066
There's no "ing."

08:04.150 --> 08:06.527
Yeah, I thought
we'd come here to Jazz Night

08:06.611 --> 08:08.863
and see how I feel
after that, okay?

08:08.946 --> 08:11.073
Okay, um, see how you feel?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.743
I thought this date
was about both of us.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.953
Of course, yeah, of course.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.496
I'm just afraid that one of us

08:17.580 --> 08:19.665
could possibly be more
into it than the other one

08:19.749 --> 08:23.085
and I wouldn't want him or her

08:23.169 --> 08:24.587
to, uh, get their hopes up

08:24.670 --> 08:27.131
and end up being upset
when it doesn't work out.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.841
When it doesn't work out.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.468
Uh, I said if.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.636
No, you said when.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.599
Why'd you even ask me out, Val?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.058
'Cause I thought
it would be fun.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.686
You know, Jazz Night.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.313
Yeah, well, you're doing
everything you can

08:42.395 --> 08:43.856
to make it not fun.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.399
It's like you're taking
two steps forward

08:45.483 --> 08:47.443
and then you take 20 steps back.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.445
You know, I was so
looking forward to tonight.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.781
It was like
I was-I was finally..

08:53.616 --> 08:56.285
You know what?
Forget it, alright?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.037
Date's off.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.962
Well, I guess there won't be
any burning sensation.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.298
Sorry.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.426
[instrumental music]

09:16.597 --> 09:19.267
[instrumental music]

09:22.228 --> 09:24.522
- Hi, boyfriend!
- Hey, baby.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.651
Ow.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.152
You still have the fur!

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
I thought you were gonna
mow that damn thing.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.949
Eh. I decided not to.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.326
So, what, you're just
gonna keep it?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.162
Yeah, I'm getting into it.
It kind of gives me a look.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.878
You know what? You're right.

09:47.962 --> 09:52.133
The more I think about it,
I mean, shaving is stupid.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.010
Hair is natural.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.720
I mean, did the caveman shave?

09:55.803 --> 09:57.930
- No.
- No!

09:58.014 --> 10:00.349
And neither did the cave lady.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.019
[gasps]
You know what?

10:03.102 --> 10:06.147
I am calling Gloria and
canceling my wax this afternoon.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.151
Y-y-you're gonna keep
your hairy legs?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.194
Yeah! Why not?

10:12.278 --> 10:15.781
I mean, the world loves the fur.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.118
Oh, no, no, no, I know that
it's short and stubbly now

10:19.201 --> 10:23.372
but wait till it
gets long and soft.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.916
Oh, oh, oh! This will be fun!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.169
Where else can
I grow out my hair?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.718
You know what, boo?
You were right.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.263
Relationships
are about compromise.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.890
I'm really proud of us.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.224
I'm proud of us too.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.018
We only acted like babies
for five minutes

10:44.101 --> 10:47.063
and now look at us,
shaving together.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.398
Each giving up
something we love.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.566
[chuckles]

10:50.649 --> 10:55.571
Sweetie, I wouldn't say
I love my leg hair.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.074
But you said it was a pleasure
not to have to wax or shave.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.534
[chuckles]
You're so cute.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.037
You really think I'd like
walking around with hair socks?
