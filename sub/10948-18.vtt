00:10.390 --> 00:14.100
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:14.220 --> 00:18.770
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:18.850 --> 00:21.770
<i>Only the Avatar, master of
all four elements, could stop them.</i>

00:21.860 --> 00:26.240
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:30.070
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:30.160 --> 00:31.820
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:31.910 --> 00:34.370
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

00:34.490 --> 00:36.700
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:36.790 --> 00:37.870
AANG: Oof!

00:37.960 --> 00:40.750
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

MAN: <i>Previously on</i> Avatar...

00:49.880 --> 00:52.300
Don't you know fans
just make flame stronger?

00:55.970 --> 00:58.180
I am Long Feng, head of the Dai Li.

00:58.310 --> 01:00.140
Why won't you let us talk to the king?

01:00.270 --> 01:03.650
The Earth King has no time to
get involved with political squabbles.

01:03.770 --> 01:05.820
So the king is just a figurehead?

01:05.940 --> 01:07.400
He's your puppet!

01:08.320 --> 01:10.990
It's time for you to look inward,

01:11.110 --> 01:14.080
and begin asking yourself
the big questions.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.580
Who are you?

01:16.200 --> 01:17.330
And what do you want?

01:18.040 --> 01:20.290
I can handle you by myself.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.250
( RUMBLING )

01:23.380 --> 01:25.040
I missed you, buddy.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.600
I missed you more than
you'll ever know, buddy.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.770
( LAUGHING )

01:43.900 --> 01:46.570
Look, we escaped from
the Dai Li, we got Appa back,

01:46.650 --> 01:50.150
I'm telling you, we should go to
the Earth King now and tell him our plan.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.610
We're on a roll.

01:51.740 --> 01:54.490
One good hour after weeks of
trouble isn't much of a roll.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.620
We can build on it.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.700
If we want to invade
the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens,

01:58.790 --> 02:00.370
we need the Earth King's support.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.540
What makes you think we'll get it?

02:02.670 --> 02:04.170
I don't know if you've noticed,

02:04.250 --> 02:07.210
but things don't usually go that
smoothly for our little gang.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.510
I know, but I've got
a good feeling about this.

02:09.590 --> 02:10.840
This time'll be different.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.930
Sokka, Long Feng is in control
of the city.

02:13.010 --> 02:16.260
His conspiracy with the Dai Li
is too powerful.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.930
I think we should just keep flying and
leave this horrible place behind us.

02:20.020 --> 02:23.650
I'm with sweetness.
I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.360
And I can't even see!

02:26.440 --> 02:27.940
But now that we have Appa back,

02:28.020 --> 02:31.150
there's nothing stopping us from telling
the Earth King the truth.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.820
About the conspiracy and the war.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.530
See, Aang's with me.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.870
It's the whole reason we came here in
the first place, we have to try.

02:38.990 --> 02:42.660
Well, I guess if the Earth King
knew the truth,

02:42.790 --> 02:44.960
things could change.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.210
I don't trust the new positive Sokka.

02:48.340 --> 02:51.010
( SHOUTING ) Long Feng
brainwashed you, didn't he?

02:55.640 --> 02:58.220
That's probably the Dai Li
searching for us, so?

02:59.600 --> 03:00.810
Let's fly.

03:00.930 --> 03:05.100
( ROARING )

03:05.900 --> 03:07.770
Can we please buy a new saddle?

03:07.900 --> 03:09.770
Riding bareback is terrifying.

03:12.490 --> 03:13.780
There it is.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.360
That whole thing is the palace.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.740
The Earth King's chamber
should be in the center.

03:17.820 --> 03:18.910
We have to be careful.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.580
Long Feng's probably warned
the king that we're coming.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.250
SOKKA: why would you assume that?

03:23.330 --> 03:26.420
If you ask me, I think we're
just gonna sail right... ( SCREAMING )

03:26.500 --> 03:28.040

03:28.130 --> 03:29.460

05:56.150 --> 05:57.610
How should I know?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.690
I'm still voting we leave Ba Sing Se.

( SOLDIER SCREAMING )

Burglar!

06:10.540 --> 06:12.000
Sorry, wrong door.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.010
You did the right thing.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.130
Letting the Avatar's bison go free.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.640
I don't feel right.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.690

06:42.070 --> 06:43.860

06:43.950 --> 06:45.410
It's gotta go somewhere.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.080
( SCREAMING ) Yah!

06:50.540 --> 06:53.290
( GRUNTING )

06:56.830 --> 06:58.540
A little warning, next time?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.310
We need to talk to you.

07:09.390 --> 07:11.930
They're here to overthrow you.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.600
No, we're on your side.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.730
We're here to help.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.190
You have to trust us.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.690
You invade my palace,

07:17.810 --> 07:19.190
lay waste to all my guards,

07:19.270 --> 07:20.650
break down my fancy door,

07:20.780 --> 07:23.650
and you expect me to trust you?

07:23.780 --> 07:25.320
He has a good point.

07:25.450 --> 07:27.160
KING: If you're on my side,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.740
then drop your weapons and stand down.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.110
But we dropped our weapons.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.650
We're your allies!

08:00.730 --> 08:05.070
Make sure the Avatar and his friends
never see daylight again.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.530
The Avatar?

08:06.610 --> 08:08.200
You're the Avatar?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.160
Uh, no, him.

08:11.530 --> 08:13.700
LONG FENG: What does it matter,
Your Highness?

08:13.790 --> 08:15.200
They're enemies of the state.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.250
Perhaps you're right.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.220
I'll hear what he has to say.

08:28.220 --> 08:31.350
AANG: Well, sir, there's a war
going on right now.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.640
For the past 100 years, in fact.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.930
The Dai Li's kept it secret from you.

08:36.060 --> 08:39.480
It's a conspiracy to control
the city and to control you.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.650
A secret war?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.400
That's crazy!

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
Completely.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.990
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you,

08:46.070 --> 08:48.070
so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.200
And blackmail is the least of his crimes.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.200
He brainwashed our friend!

08:52.320 --> 08:53.660
All lies.

08:53.780 --> 08:56.500
I've never even seen
a sky bison, Your Majesty.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.170
Frankly, I thought they were extinct.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.920
Your claim is difficult to believe.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.960
Even from an Avatar.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.920
( WHISPERING ) These hooligans are part of
an anarchist cell

09:06.050 --> 09:08.800
that my legions have been
tracking for weeks.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.760
If you listen to them, you're playing
right into your own destruction.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.100
I have to trust my advisor.

09:21.190 --> 09:24.320
Wait, I can prove he's lying!

09:24.400 --> 09:27.110
Long Feng said he's never seen
a sky bison.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.530
Ask him to lift his robe.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.740
What?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.740
I am not disrobing.

09:36.870 --> 09:40.540
AANG: Right there, Appa bit him!

09:40.620 --> 09:43.210
Never met a sky bison, huh?

09:43.290 --> 09:46.250
That happens to be a large birthmark.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.460
Thanks for showing everyone.

09:48.550 --> 09:51.800
Well, I suppose there's no way to prove
where those marks came from.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.140
Of course there is.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.060
( RUMBLING )

09:58.600 --> 10:01.100
Yep, that pretty much proves it.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.400
( CHEERING )

10:04.440 --> 10:07.270
But it doesn't prove
this crazy conspiracy theory.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.730
( GROANING )

10:08.860 --> 10:12.400
Though, I suppose this matter
is worth looking into.

uh, yeah, all right.

So thirsty.

Here's some clean water to drink.

and sweat this out.

11:02.290 --> 11:05.250
So this is what a train is like.

11:05.370 --> 11:08.790
I didn't realize it would be
this... Public.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.340
So you've never been outside
the upper ring before?

11:12.420 --> 11:14.590
I've never been outside the palace.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.550
Now that's the way to travel.

11:19.140 --> 11:22.020
So, may I ask where we're going?

11:22.100 --> 11:24.850
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.560
To the Dai Li secret headquarters.

That's O.K., Still got
my positive attitude.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.300
The Dai Li must have known we were coming
and destroyed the evidence.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.840
Hmm, that seems awfully convenient.

11:55.930 --> 12:00.470
Hey, if anything, this proves
the conspiracy exists even more.

12:00.550 --> 12:03.600
Long Feng was right,
this was a waste of time.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.520
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to the palace.

12:07.980 --> 12:08.980
The wall!

that up in time.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.610

12:14.280 --> 12:16.490
If you come with us to the outer wall,

12:16.570 --> 12:19.910
we can prove to you
that the secret war is real.

No Earth King
has ever been to the outer wall.

for this nonsense.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.060
I have to be honest with you.

Part of me really hopes that what you're
telling me about this war...

14:12.850 --> 14:14.150
What is that?

14:14.230 --> 14:15.270
It's a drill.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.820
A giant drill, made by the Fire Nation,

14:17.940 --> 14:20.110
to break through your walls.

14:24.410 --> 14:27.530
I can't believe I never knew.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.290
I can explain this, Your Majesty.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.960
This is nothing more than...

14:33.080 --> 14:34.880
A construction project.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.170
Really?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.550
Then perhaps you could explain why there's

14:38.630 --> 14:41.630
a Fire Nation insignia on
your construction project.

14:43.430 --> 14:45.550
Well, it's imported, of course.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.850
You know you can't trust
domestic machinery.

14:51.180 --> 14:54.900
Surely you don't believe these children
instead of your most loyal attendant?

15:01.940 --> 15:04.530
Dai Li, arrest Long Feng.

15:04.610 --> 15:07.910
I want him to stand trial for crimes
against the Earth Kingdom.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.000
You can't arrest me.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.340
You all need me more than you know!

15:22.420 --> 15:25.220
Looks like Long Feng is long gone!

15:25.300 --> 15:26.970
Ha...

15:27.050 --> 15:29.140
Oh, yeah, I've been waitin'
to use that one.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.020
KING: I want to thank you, young heroes,

15:37.100 --> 15:39.020
for opening my eyes.

15:39.110 --> 15:42.900
All this time, what I thought was a great
metropolis was merely a city of fools.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.700
And that makes me the king fool.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.030
( RUMBLING )

15:48.120 --> 15:50.950
We're at war with the Fire Nation.

15:51.030 --> 15:53.830
SOKKA: That's why we came
to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness.

15:53.910 --> 15:56.290
Because we think
you could help us end the war.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.380
AANG: We don't have much time.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.170
There's a comet coming this summer.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.590
Its energy will give the firebenders
unbelievable strength.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.300
They'll be unstoppable.

16:05.420 --> 16:06.760
But there is hope.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.760
Before the comet comes,
we have a window of opportunity.

16:09.890 --> 16:11.970
A solar eclipse is coming.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.390
The sun will be entirely
blocked out by the moon,

16:14.520 --> 16:16.770
and the firebenders will be helpless.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.400
What are you suggesting, Sokka?

16:18.480 --> 16:22.230
That's the day we need to invade
the Fire Nation.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.440
The day of black sun.

16:25.530 --> 16:26.860
I don't know.

16:26.950 --> 16:29.360
That would require
moving troops out of Ba Sing Se.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.450
We'd be completely vulnerable.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.740
You're already vulnerable.

16:33.830 --> 16:37.460
The Fire Nation won't stop
until Ba Sing Se falls.

16:37.540 --> 16:40.710
You can either sit back
and wait for that to happen,

16:40.790 --> 16:44.380
or take the offensive and give
yourself a fighting chance.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.430
Very well.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.800
You have my support.

16:50.890 --> 16:55.060
( CHEERING )

16:55.140 --> 16:56.810
MAN: Your Majesty.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.440
I apologize for the interruption.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.110
KING: This is General How.

17:03.190 --> 17:07.400
He's the leader of the Council of Five,
my highest-ranking generals.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.780
We searched Long Feng's office.

17:09.860 --> 17:14.240
I think we found something
that will interest everybody.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.250
There are secret files
on everyone in Ba Sing Se.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.580
Including you kids.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.250
Secret files?

17:22.330 --> 17:23.920
KING: Toph Beifong.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.550
It's a letter from your mom.

17:28.670 --> 17:30.760
Your mom's here in the city.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.970
And she wants to see you.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.720
Long Feng intercepted
our letters from home?

17:35.850 --> 17:36.930
That's just sad.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.480
KING: Aang.

17:38.560 --> 17:43.150
This scroll was attached to the horn of
your bison when the Dai Li captured it.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.440
It's from the Eastern Air Temple.

17:46.530 --> 17:51.570
Is there a letter for me
and Sokka, by any chance?

17:51.700 --> 17:52.700
I'm afraid not.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.700
Oh.

17:55.780 --> 17:59.120
But there <i>is</i> an intelligence
report that might interest you.

17:59.450 --> 18:01.710
A small fleet of water tribe ships?

18:01.790 --> 18:02.960
What?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.380
That could be Dad!

18:04.460 --> 18:06.380
Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.420
Led by Hakoda, it is Dad!

18:12.090 --> 18:15.470
UNCLE: You should know
this is not a natural sickness.

18:15.550 --> 18:19.770
But that shouldn't stop you
from enjoying tea.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.350
What, what's happening?

18:21.440 --> 18:25.980
Your critical decision,
what you did beneath that lake,

18:26.060 --> 18:29.900
it was in such conflict
with your image of yourself

18:29.990 --> 18:35.160
that you are now at war
within your own mind and body.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.830
What's that mean?

18:36.910 --> 18:39.870
( COUGHING )

18:39.950 --> 18:43.620
You're going through
a metamorphosis, my nephew.

18:43.710 --> 18:46.590
It will not be a pleasant experience.

18:46.670 --> 18:48.920
But when you come out of it,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.670
you will be the beautiful prince
you were always meant to be.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.430
AANG: I can't believe it.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.010
There's a man living at
the Eastern Air Temple.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.350
He says he's a guru.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.230
What's a guru?
Some kind of poisonous blowfish?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.650
No, a spiritual expert.

19:05.730 --> 19:08.770
He wants to help me take the next step in
the Avatar journey.

19:08.860 --> 19:11.320
He says he can teach me
to control the Avatar state.

19:11.530 --> 19:14.490
And I can't believe
we know where our dad is now.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.740
I know what you mean.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.620
My mom's in the city,

19:17.700 --> 19:20.990
and from her letter, it sounds like she
finally understands me.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.370
This is all such big news.

19:23.460 --> 19:24.830
Where do we even start?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.960
I hate to say it, but...

19:27.040 --> 19:28.500
We have to split up.

19:28.590 --> 19:29.960
Split up?

19:30.050 --> 19:32.510
We just found Appa and got
the family back together.

19:32.590 --> 19:35.130
Now you want us to separate?

19:35.260 --> 19:37.510
You have to meet this guru, Aang.

19:37.590 --> 19:42.020
If we're gonna invade
the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.480
Well, if I'm going to
the Eastern Air Temple,

19:44.560 --> 19:47.440
Appa and I can drop you off at
Chameleon Bay to see your dad.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.610
Someone has to stay here with
the Earth King

19:49.690 --> 19:51.360
and help him plan for the invasion.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.530
I guess that's me.

19:52.610 --> 19:55.950
No, Sokka, I know how badly
you want to help Dad.

19:56.030 --> 19:59.620
You go to Chameleon Bay,
I'll stay here with the king.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.830
You are the...

20:01.910 --> 20:04.750
Nicest... Sister... Ever!

20:04.830 --> 20:06.670
( KISSING )

20:06.750 --> 20:08.540
Easy there, big brother.

20:08.630 --> 20:10.090
Though you're right, I am.

20:16.970 --> 20:20.220
AANG: Katara, I need to
tell you something.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.930
I've been wanting to say it
for a long time.

20:23.010 --> 20:24.100
What is it, Aang?

20:24.180 --> 20:26.390
Katara, I...

20:26.480 --> 20:27.890
All right!

20:27.980 --> 20:32.230
Who's ready to get going on
a little men-only, man trip?

20:32.320 --> 20:35.780
Aang and Sokka, I wish you a good journey.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.950
Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks.

20:38.030 --> 20:41.160
And we look forward to your safe return.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.410
GUARD: Your Majesty, there are three
female warriors here to see you.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.120
They're from the island of Kyoshi.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.420
That's Suki!

20:48.500 --> 20:50.920
( SCREAMING )

20:51.000 --> 20:52.420
You know these warriors?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.550
Oh, yeah.

20:53.630 --> 20:56.210
The Kyoshi Warriors
are a skilled group of fighters.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.300
Trustworthy, too.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.550
They're good friends of ours.

21:00.390 --> 21:04.010
Then we shall welcome them
as honored guests.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.970
KATARA: Wait, Aang.

21:08.730 --> 21:11.480
( KISSING )

21:11.560 --> 21:13.570
TOPH: I'm really gonna miss you guys.

21:13.650 --> 21:16.360
KATARA: Me, too.
AANG: Yeah.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.650
( SCREAMING )

21:19.780 --> 21:21.870
Great, that's enough.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.910
O.K., We love each other.

21:24.030 --> 21:25.040
Seriously.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.950
( RUMBLING )

21:47.100 --> 21:49.980
( SCREAMING )

21:50.060 --> 21:51.350
( GASPING )

22:01.910 --> 22:03.950
SOKKA: You see, Aang?

22:04.030 --> 22:05.990
A little positive thinking works wonders.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.040
We got the king on our side,
we got Long Feng arrested,

22:09.120 --> 22:11.620
and when we get back,
Suki's waiting for me.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.000
Yeah.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.790
Girls are waiting for us.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.050
Thanks, positive attitude.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.710
Everything is gonna work out perfectly.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.590
From now on and forever.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.980
MAN: Dinner.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.810
The Council of Five and the military
are loyal to the Earth King.

22:35.900 --> 22:41.400
But the Dai Li remains loyal
to you, Long Feng, sir.

22:49.740 --> 22:51.500
( SIGHING )

22:55.580 --> 22:58.170
Hello, Mom?

22:58.250 --> 23:00.840
Anyone home?

23:03.680 --> 23:05.260
( SCREAMING )

23:05.390 --> 23:07.050
Hey!

23:07.180 --> 23:09.640
Who do you think you're dealing with?

23:09.760 --> 23:15.480
One loudmouthed little brat
who strayed too far from home.

23:24.150 --> 23:25.990
KING: In our hour of need,

23:26.070 --> 23:29.200
it is with the highest honor that I
welcome our esteemed allies,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.040
the Kyoshi Warriors.

23:32.620 --> 23:36.120
We are the Earth King's humble servants.
