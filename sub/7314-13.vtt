WEBVTT

00:04.237 --> 00:06.605
Man:
<i>Quit driving like an old man.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:09.408
The girls know we worth
waiting for.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.043
I-I don't want to screw this up.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.711
I like janice.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.513
She understands me.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.081
And she's easy on the eyes.
Mm-hmm.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.083
But it's good to be
a few minutes late.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.418
Keeps them on their toes.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.286
I'm not playing games, lester.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.222
I'm too old for that nonsense.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.190
Who said anything
about playing games?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.625
I'm talking about
keeping her interested.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.228
I'm talking about
psychological foreplay.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.329
Oh.
(chuckles)

00:30.331 --> 00:32.564
I'm still awake,
how's that for foreplay?

00:32.566 --> 00:33.699
(laughs)

00:35.268 --> 00:37.336
Stop the car, lester.

00:37.804 --> 00:40.105
(tires squeal)

00:40.107 --> 00:42.041
Marty, what's wrong?

00:42.043 --> 00:43.409
Come on!
Where you going?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.681
Marty, um, what's...

00:49.683 --> 00:51.150
What the...?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.385
Call 911, lester. Now!

01:27.253 --> 01:29.254
If we need any more information,
we will contact you.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.355
Sure.
Okay.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.657
So he pulls me
into his office

01:31.659 --> 01:33.625
And I think he's gonna
chew me out for that

01:33.627 --> 01:36.128
Thing I said about
his hair, right?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.496
But no.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.164
He wants to know
if I think

01:39.166 --> 01:42.568
He's been doing
an okay job.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.503
The deputy
is no director vance,

01:44.505 --> 01:45.804
That's for sure.
No.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.240
Did he say anything about
when he's coming back?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.374
(sighs)

01:49.376 --> 01:51.276
You talk to her
since she got back?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.145
She told me israel
was "therapeutic."

01:53.147 --> 01:54.847
In a good way or a bad way?

01:54.849 --> 01:56.682
Think she's okay?

01:57.650 --> 01:59.585
Two fatalities.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.553
Civilian lyla cutwright

02:01.555 --> 02:03.122
And marine lance corporal
chad dunn.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.157
It's a brutal stretch of road.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.458
Drove past an accident

02:06.460 --> 02:08.460
About a mile up
from here last week.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.562
The turn must have
caught them by surprise.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.763
Dinozzo. Mcgee.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.899
Come on down.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.804
Tony: Faulty air bag,
no seat belt.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.772
Lance corporal's head

02:20.774 --> 02:22.207
Had an unfortunate date
with the windshield.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.476
Yeah, after that,
he was ejected through

02:24.478 --> 02:25.544
The door here.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.179
Guy had a hell of a morning.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.647
Okay, what are we
looking at, duck?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.882
Well, aside from a rather

02:29.884 --> 02:31.850
Unkempt car, we are looking

02:31.852 --> 02:34.186
At a two-pronged
curiosity involving

02:34.188 --> 02:35.787
Miss cutwright here--
take a look

02:35.789 --> 02:37.689
At this side of her head.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.591
Severe trauma.
Well, I see the spatter.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.326
What did she hit
her head on?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.195
Well, that's the question.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.898
I don't see any point of impact
within the car.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.399
What's part two?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.567
The air bags.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.169
Although the driver's side

02:50.171 --> 02:51.603
Air bag did not deploy,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.305
This young lady's

02:53.307 --> 02:54.573
Is in perfect
working order.

02:55.942 --> 02:58.477
Her head was already bleeding
when it hit the bag.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.245
Uh, precisely.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.614
Miss sciuto will have
to tell us exactly

03:02.616 --> 03:04.917
What this blood spatter
here is saying,

03:04.919 --> 03:07.719
But, from what I can see
in front of me...

03:07.721 --> 03:09.855
You think she was beaten.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.223
While she was in the car,

03:11.225 --> 03:12.624
Before it went over the ridge.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.593
There are no skid marks.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.762
Our simple accident...
(chuckles)

03:16.764 --> 03:19.798
May not be either one of those.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.201
Hey.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.869
Possible murder-suicide.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.337
Get the car to abby.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.774
Mcgee:
<i>Car belonged to lance corporal</i>

03:28.776 --> 03:29.775
Chad dunn.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.276
He was driving.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.811
Got it.

03:32.813 --> 03:36.315
I don't know if anyone's ever
told you this before, mcgee,

03:36.317 --> 03:38.984
But you are the most
helpful person

03:38.986 --> 03:40.319
When it comes to

03:40.321 --> 03:42.387
Clipboard-y type situations.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.522
Thank you. I try.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.625
So, anything else
you need me for?

03:46.627 --> 03:47.893
Yeah,

03:47.895 --> 03:50.295
He hit it pretty hard.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.532
Abby, you okay?

03:53.534 --> 03:56.768
(train horn blares)

03:56.770 --> 03:57.903
Abby, come on,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.271
Let's go.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.539
How do you think
it happened?

04:00.541 --> 04:01.974
It crashed.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.942
I know that, silly.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.545
But what do you think happened?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.680
You know, maybe the guy
driving dropped

04:08.682 --> 04:10.282
His ice cream on his shorts,

04:10.284 --> 04:12.017
And bam, luca.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.420
His car is in the middle
of a chinese restaurant.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.823
Mom said we're not supposed
to play in the junkyard.

04:17.825 --> 04:18.991
(train whistle blowing)
we're not playing.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.260
We're investigating.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.428
(sighs)

04:23.430 --> 04:24.896
I'm going home.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.904
Luca, luca, luca!

04:35.441 --> 04:37.776
There was a kid in the car?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.512
Someone wrote their name on it.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.613
What's it say?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.917
Can't read it.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.319
It's too small.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.055
Oh.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.323
Where are you going?

04:51.325 --> 04:52.524
How would you feel

04:52.526 --> 04:54.660
If you were a little girl
in a terrible wreck,

04:54.662 --> 04:55.861
And then you had to live

04:55.863 --> 04:57.529
Without the bear you loved?

04:57.531 --> 05:00.866
I'm gonna find her...
And give it back.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.002
But what if she died
in the chinese restaurant?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.004
She didn't.
Abby, how are you

05:06.006 --> 05:08.340
Gonna find her when you can't
even read her name?

05:08.342 --> 05:09.741
You watch.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.942
Mcgee:
<i>Abby!</i>

05:12.812 --> 05:14.846
You look like
you just saw a ghost.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.815
Yeah.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.483
Well, we talked
about this, remember?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.751
Ghosts aren't real.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.422
I-I didn't see
a ghost, mcgee.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.358
I just...

05:26.360 --> 05:29.094
I was just thinking about
my first case.

05:29.096 --> 05:33.065
Wait... Dead marine
in the car wash.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.535
No, no.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.936
Not my first case

05:37.938 --> 05:39.471
At ncis, mcgee.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.807
My first case ever.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.675
In my life.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.811
When was that?

05:45.813 --> 05:48.747
I was a kid...

05:49.882 --> 05:52.517
And?

05:52.519 --> 05:54.119
I don't want to talk
about it, mcgee.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.955
I can't.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.568
Did she say why she did
not want to talk about it?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.136
No, but she seemed pretty upset.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.638
Kind of casework are you doing
when you're a kid?

06:13.640 --> 06:16.007
Old man jenkins robbed
the cookie jar again.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.910
Old man jenkins
drained the swimming hole.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.545
Who is this jenkins,
and why does he do

06:20.547 --> 06:21.747
Such horrible things?

06:22.849 --> 06:24.015
I'm kind of worried about her.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.386
I mean, abby always
finds a way to be happy.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.487
Tony:
Yeah.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.621
I'm sure she's
down there right now,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.523
Dancing a jig
and teaching sign language

06:31.525 --> 06:32.657
To a dog.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.992
You got something against dogs,
dinozzo?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.494
No, boss.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.895
I love all canine beings.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.630
Especially the dogs
that you love.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.465
Good. Give me an update. Go.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.500
(computer chirps)

06:41.502 --> 06:42.701
Lyla cutwright.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.803
She turned 19
last November.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.671
Student at hayworth
community college

06:46.673 --> 06:47.773
In virginia.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.040
Last seen by her father

06:49.042 --> 06:50.509
When he dropped her off
at class yesterday.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.044
Working theory is
she was beaten

06:53.046 --> 06:55.580
And then driven off the
ridge by this guy.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.982
Lance corporal chad dunn.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.116
Twenty.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.419
Last seen leaving
the marine barracks

07:00.421 --> 07:01.853
On weekend liberty.
C.O.?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.455
Nothing but good
things to say.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.657
No signs of violence
or depression.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.559
Said dunn
was looking forward to a

07:07.561 --> 07:09.528
Transfer to pendleton
next month.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.930
Between the two?
Uh, cutwright's father

07:11.932 --> 07:13.198
Owns a dry cleaner
in quantico.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.533
Lance corporal dunn's

07:14.535 --> 07:16.168
Father is a retired marine.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.003
He was stationed
at quantico ten years ago.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.005
Kids met over apple juice
and graham crackers.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.073
Went to grade school
together for a year.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.075
What's the connection
between the two now?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.844
Mcgee:
Can't find one.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.212
There's no evidence
of any contact between them

07:27.214 --> 07:29.981
Uh, but there is
one thing, gibbs.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.850
Uh, back when both fathers

07:31.852 --> 07:32.984
Were at quantico,
they were involved

07:32.986 --> 07:36.188
Details are sketchy,
you can see for yourself.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.889
But both men
were charged

07:37.891 --> 07:39.057
With disorderly conduct.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.559
It's possible this whole thing's

07:40.561 --> 07:42.494
Over some old family beef.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.929
Bring in the families.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.202
(door whooshes open)

07:50.204 --> 07:51.670
Need everything
you got, duck.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.804
Start at the top.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.073
Uh, gladly, jethro.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.975
1891.

07:56.977 --> 08:02.581
Smashed his gasoline buggy
into a hitching post,

08:02.583 --> 08:04.583
Thus marking the first accident

08:04.585 --> 08:05.717
In american history.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.586
Hey, duck, start at
the top of this one.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.854
(chuckles)

08:08.856 --> 08:10.922
Yeah, very well.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.858
Lance corporal dunn.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.126
His lack of a seat belt
and ejection from the vehicle

08:15.128 --> 08:16.995
Makes for quite
a laundry list.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.063
Three broken ribs,

08:18.065 --> 08:20.832
Fractured femur and pelvis.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.668
A myriad of contusions
and abrasions,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.136
And the coup de grace:

08:25.138 --> 08:26.738
Massive skull fracture.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.873
Cause of death:

08:27.875 --> 08:29.040
Blunt force trauma.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.575
Where his head
hit the rock?

08:30.577 --> 08:32.010
Yeah, the very same
cause of death

08:32.012 --> 08:33.879
As miss cutwright here.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.181
However, as I suspected,

08:36.183 --> 08:39.284
She was deceased
before the crash.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.887
Struck on the left temple

08:41.889 --> 08:44.589
With some sort of blunt object.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.724
Any idea what?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.992
Well, I pulled some

08:46.994 --> 08:48.760
Fragments from the laceration.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.161
Abby's testing them now.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.296
Also,

08:51.298 --> 08:53.765
She's testing some
material that I took

08:53.767 --> 08:55.233
From under her fingernails.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.635
However,

08:56.637 --> 08:59.170
The lack of defensive wounds,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.906
I would hazard a guess

09:00.908 --> 09:03.675
That this was a
surprise attack.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.911
Thanks, duck.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.780
Oh, be forewarned,

09:08.782 --> 09:10.582
She is acting a bit strange.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.652
Abby?

09:13.654 --> 09:14.853
Mm.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.556
Or I should say,

09:17.558 --> 09:20.025
A bit stranger than usual.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.695
Abby:
It's not what it looks like.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.931
Hm. What's it look like?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.065
A mess.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.700
But... But it's not.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.201
The lance corporal's car,
that was a mess.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.670
But I have this system

09:31.672 --> 09:34.205
With colors.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.273
Abby?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.274
Um, okay, we have a lot

09:36.276 --> 09:37.275
To get through, so let's

09:37.277 --> 09:38.610
Get started.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.312
Um, number one:
Am I okay?

09:40.314 --> 09:41.680
Yes.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.214
Um, number two: There was no dna

09:43.216 --> 09:44.749
Under cutwright's fingernails.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.218
Number three:
I tested the fragments

09:47.220 --> 09:51.089
And the murder weapon
was made of chestnut.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.857
Chestnut. It's a nice wood.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.225
It's fairly rare.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.695
Does anything here match?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.330
Uh, no.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.765
The weapon
was probably ditched

10:00.767 --> 10:02.100
Somewhere before
the crash,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.235
Because... Wait, was I...

10:04.237 --> 10:05.704
Was I on number four

10:05.706 --> 10:07.339
Or number five now?

10:07.341 --> 10:09.240
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.876
Let's just... Let's get
to the blood spatter evidence.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.213
Um...

10:15.215 --> 10:17.682
So, cutwright was hit

10:17.684 --> 10:20.018
On the left side
of her head.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.021
But she was facing
out her window.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.157
So her attacker was
standing outside the car,

10:26.159 --> 10:29.127
Which means...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.862
Means what?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.864
Well, I don't know.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.866
Why... Why would dunn

10:34.868 --> 10:37.035
Be standing outside
of his own car?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.037
Maybe he got out
to get a weapon,

10:39.039 --> 10:43.274
Or... Or maybe
someone else hit her

10:43.276 --> 10:45.877
And then dunn
was gonna try

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
To drive the car away, or...

10:47.781 --> 10:48.980
I don't know.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.048
I'm just...

10:50.050 --> 10:52.684
Confused.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.421
Yeah.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.922
(animal chirring)

10:57.924 --> 10:59.858
Luca:
What are you making?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.927
If I told you, that would ruin
the surprise, and

11:02.929 --> 11:05.030
Surprises are the best
'cause your eyes get to pop out,

11:05.032 --> 11:06.297
And you can see
the world better...

11:06.299 --> 11:08.266
Abby!

11:08.268 --> 11:09.968
Okay.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.237
Ready. Yay!

11:13.239 --> 11:14.773
Give me your water.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.444
Now, the water should work
as a lens.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.845
Mm-hmm.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.882
And bend the light, so...

11:26.419 --> 11:28.953
Look, luca! It's bigger.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.922
I can see the name.
Whoa.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.258
"ricki evans."

11:33.260 --> 11:34.793
Do you know her?

11:34.795 --> 11:35.927
Nope.

11:35.929 --> 11:39.030
But somebody will.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.865
Gibbs:
Abbs?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.069
(sighs)
um...

11:44.071 --> 11:45.370
Okay, gibbs, you know what?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.872
I'm... I am little
tiny bit off today,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.341
But I'm... I will
be okay, I promise.

11:50.343 --> 11:54.212
I need you to bring your a game.

11:56.949 --> 11:58.183
Where are we going?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.317
Who's in charge here?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.452
Mr. Dunn, I just need you

12:00.454 --> 12:02.020
To follow me to the
conference room.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.221
No, no, no. I'm done
with the shuffling.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.923
Look, I understand, but...

12:04.925 --> 12:07.158
First, they shuffle
us up here.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.359
Now you want to shuffle us
somewhere else.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.028
Now, I've got questions.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.196
You can answer 'em right here.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.098
Walter, let's just go
where they...

12:13.100 --> 12:15.033
What was she doing
in my son's car?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.201
There something I can help with?

12:16.203 --> 12:17.335
This is mr. And mrs. Dunn,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.370
Lance corporal dunn's parents.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.040
This is agent gibbs.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.143
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.079
Conference room's not open?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.781
Walter:
Oh, you people are amazing.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.483
Look, if you're accusing
my son of something,

12:31.485 --> 12:34.385
How about you just stand there
like a man and say it?

12:34.387 --> 12:35.987
No one's accusing anyone
of anything.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.455
We're still looking for answers.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.790
Walter:
You want answers?

12:38.792 --> 12:39.991
Take a look
at that girl.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.793
What was she doing
in his car?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.128
She had to have been
up to something.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.130
What do you mean, mr. Dunn?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.965
Walter?

12:50.002 --> 12:51.402
How could this happen?

12:52.471 --> 12:53.838
Your son killed my lyla.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.473
(groans)
mrs. Dunn:
Stop it.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.909
...About my son.
Gibbs: Walk away!

12:57.911 --> 12:59.144
Don't you ever talk
about my son!

12:59.146 --> 13:00.478
Gibbs:
Walk away!

13:00.480 --> 13:02.347
Now!

13:13.425 --> 13:16.060
It's done.
First, it's cut right.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.462
Ten years after

13:17.464 --> 13:19.063
Duking it out the first time,
they meet again,

13:19.065 --> 13:21.432
Hungry for blood,
out for revenge.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.802
Pride on the line.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.069
So, boss...

13:25.071 --> 13:28.106
This time, it's personal.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.340
I'm done.
Mcgee:
According to abby,

13:29.342 --> 13:32.277
A third person
swinging the murder weapon?

13:32.279 --> 13:33.444
She doesn't know.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.979
So, she's leaning

13:34.981 --> 13:36.581
More toward
the murder-suicide theory?

13:36.583 --> 13:37.916
Doesn't know.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.851
So, she doesn't know?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.586
That's what I said, mcgee.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.154
Ziva:
Scott cutwright
and the dunns

13:43.156 --> 13:45.523
Are ready to talk.
Separate rooms.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.226
Got blood?
No, but

13:48.228 --> 13:49.994
It is clear the feud
started long before today.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.229
You know what it's about?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.463
Well, from what I see,

13:52.465 --> 13:53.998
Neither side wants
to discuss it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.133
Boss, what do you think?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.501
You take the hatfields,
I take the mccoy?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.203
Mcgee:
Got something, boss.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.537
Last week,
lyla cutwright

13:59.539 --> 14:01.105
Made a call to the local

14:01.107 --> 14:03.007
Police, lasted
two seconds.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.009
Tony:
Oh, hung up before
the call went through.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.545
Lance corporal dunn also dialed
an interesting number.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.047
Called a disposable phone

14:09.049 --> 14:10.615
The night before
the crash was discovered.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.150
Looks like he called it

14:12.152 --> 14:13.618
Multiple times over
the last two days.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.953
Find the phone.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.487
Finding the phone.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.956
Dinozzo, crime
scene road.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.626
Ooh, boss. You know, dorney
loves this kind of stuff.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.027
Really feeds off it.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.496
Ziver, I got hatfields,
you got mccoy.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.132
Let's go.
Weapon's chestnut.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.403
Ah, hell. Just look
for something made out of wood.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.439
That shouldn't be hard
to spot...

14:34.441 --> 14:36.541
In the woods.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.380
(door opening)

14:44.183 --> 14:46.584
You want some ice
for that?

14:48.187 --> 14:50.054
I want you to get to it.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.223
Fair enough.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.360
Can either one of you
think of a reason

14:55.362 --> 14:58.129
Your son might want
to hurt lyla cutwright?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.330
No.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.965
Mrs. Dunn?

15:00.967 --> 15:02.233
I said no.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.535
And I said, either of you.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.604
Can you think of a reason?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.340
Scott:
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>he'd want to hurt her.</i>

15:09.342 --> 15:12.343
She hasn't mentioned him
in years.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.246
Do you know that...
For sure?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.215
Do you know he killed her?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.616
We're still investigating.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.018
(sighs)

15:20.020 --> 15:23.087
I'm sorry about that out there.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.290
Walter has a temper.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.092
Always did.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.029
Maybe his son was the same way.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.031
My son was a trained marine,

15:33.033 --> 15:35.233
But chad would never hurt anyone

15:35.235 --> 15:37.101
Unless he was
defending himself.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.369
She provoked him,

15:38.371 --> 15:40.238
Threatened him or something.
It's not on him.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.508
This altercation you had ten
years ago-- what was it about?

15:43.510 --> 15:45.643
No.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.112
No, that's not the reason
for this.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.381
Besides their grade school,
this is the only connection

15:50.383 --> 15:52.617
We found between your daughter
and chad dunn.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.586
Mr. Cutwright, I need you
to tell me what happened.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.221
Cutwright is crazy.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.357
His wife died,
and he went crazy.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.392
Walter.
Meredith.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.593
Let me finish.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.263
He started
saying things about

16:05.265 --> 16:06.397
My family.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.532
What kind of things?

16:07.534 --> 16:08.633
Lies.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.668
He didn't believe me.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.572
Meredith dunn and I...

16:14.574 --> 16:17.375
We fell in love.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.510
She wanted to leave walter.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.313
She was too afraid
to tell him.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.182
So you did it for her.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.117
Yeah, I did.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.119
He...

16:28.121 --> 16:29.721
He beat the hell out of me.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.390
Yeah. Yeah, we fought,
we fought.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.727
He was talking
about my wife.

16:35.729 --> 16:39.464
Your son know about the fight?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.432
Everyone knew.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.501
Everyone talked.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.503
The kids--

16:45.505 --> 16:48.039
They were affected.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.441
Chad forgot about it
in a week.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.743
The fight was
ancient history

16:51.745 --> 16:54.512
To us, but cutwright--
who knows?

16:55.547 --> 16:57.715
The guy's crazy.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.218
Mrs. Dunn?

17:00.220 --> 17:02.220
Yes.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.322
It was a long time ago.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.058
I wrote her a letter.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.493
When?

17:08.495 --> 17:10.228
Last year.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.563
(clears throat)
I told her how I felt, and...

17:12.565 --> 17:16.200
She wrote back,
and we kept writing.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.204
She was going
to leave him this time.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.473
Did chad dunn know?

17:22.475 --> 17:24.575
I don't know.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.477
(sighs)

17:26.479 --> 17:28.479
But if he did,

17:28.481 --> 17:31.616
I'm ripping
his family apart.

17:31.618 --> 17:36.187
Maybe he was trying
to do the same thing to mine.

17:36.189 --> 17:40.825
Chad dunn didn't kill lyla
cutwright out of revenge.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.094
He didn't kill her at all.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.797
At the time of the crash, I
believe he was unconscious.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.132
What is this?

17:48.134 --> 17:49.634
This is a computer

17:49.636 --> 17:51.102
Simulation of the events

17:51.104 --> 17:52.370
Leading up to the crash.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.504
No. What's this?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.206
This is my a game.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.674
And this

17:56.676 --> 17:57.842
Is our killer.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.344
He strikes
and kills lyla cutwright,

18:00.346 --> 18:02.380
And then, he moves
to the other side

18:02.382 --> 18:03.681
As dunn exits.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.250
With his hand,
the killer bashes dunn's head

18:06.252 --> 18:07.452
Up against the car.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.554
I found blood
and hair transfer

18:09.556 --> 18:11.189
From dunn here.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.257
The hit rendered
him unconscious.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.393
The killer then moves
dunn into the car,

18:15.395 --> 18:18.129
And drives it off the ridge
while he's running alongside.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.164
Well, how does he push
down on the gas?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.500
Reenter the weapon
used to kill cutwright.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.602
I found the same
aluminum fragments

18:24.604 --> 18:26.771
On the gas pedal as I did

18:26.773 --> 18:28.139
In her head wound.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.273
I thought you said

18:29.275 --> 18:30.541
The weapon was made
out of chestnut?

18:30.543 --> 18:31.809
I did. That was a mistake.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.444
I got my slides
mixed up before.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.846
But this is right.

18:34.848 --> 18:37.482
It's aluminum, and it's on
the back of paint flecks.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.817
Abby, I got dinozzo looking
for the wrong thing.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.587
I'm sorry. I was
coming up to tell you,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.522
And then that whole fight
happened, and I got flustered.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.224
Hey, hey,
what's going on with you?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.792
I made a mistake... Gibbs.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.161
I'm sorry.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.330
I'm not perfect, like you are.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.847
(screen door creaks open)

19:13.552 --> 19:15.186
(indistinct crowd chatter)

19:15.188 --> 19:17.321
(rooster crowing)

19:17.323 --> 19:20.391
Are you ricki evans?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.395
I knew it! I-I mean,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.397
I only knew 'cause
this wrinkly guy--

19:26.399 --> 19:28.733
Um, he works at the mini-mart--

19:28.735 --> 19:30.735
He told me that you lived here

19:30.737 --> 19:33.471
Because, uh...

19:33.473 --> 19:35.740
I s...

19:35.742 --> 19:37.842
I said I needed to know.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.212
Today is my mama's funeral.

19:41.214 --> 19:44.482
A car hit our car
and drove away.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.553
(sighs)

19:48.555 --> 19:50.621
I... I found your bear.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.824
I brought it back for you.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.694
I can't keep it.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.231
Why?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.899
I'm only allowed
to play with it

20:01.901 --> 20:03.968
When I'm with my
mom and grandpa.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.704
My dad doesn't like that bear.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.906
Hmm. How come?

20:08.908 --> 20:11.309
'cause grandpa gave it to me.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.378
Your dad doesn't
like your grandpa?

20:14.380 --> 20:17.548
I only visit my grandpa
when I'm with my mom.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.519
So... I guess

20:21.521 --> 20:23.888
He can't really be
my grandpa anymore.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.531
Man:
Ricki?

20:33.533 --> 20:36.767
Come on, baby,
let's get you some lunch.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.872
Get in the house now.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.443
Said you got rid
of that thing.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.578
You lying to me now?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.449
Who that girl
you're talking to?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.517
(door closes)

20:59.625 --> 21:01.892
Young abby:
<i>I'm gonna find her</i>
<i>and give it back.</i>

21:01.894 --> 21:03.728
<i>Ricki evans.</i>

21:03.730 --> 21:05.696
<i>I found your bear.</i>

21:05.698 --> 21:07.265
Ricki:
<i>I can't keep it.</i>

21:07.267 --> 21:09.467
<i>Guess... He can't really be</i>
<i>my grandpa anymore.</i>

21:09.469 --> 21:10.868
(sighs)

21:12.904 --> 21:15.640
(phone rings)

21:15.642 --> 21:17.008
(phone beeps on)

21:17.010 --> 21:18.709
Yeah, mcgee.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.578
Boss, I got a hit
on the disposable phone.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.713
What's the address?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.315
(engine revving)

21:24.317 --> 21:26.050
(brakes squeak)

21:29.588 --> 21:31.856
Not what I pictured.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.858
It doesn't look like a block

21:33.860 --> 21:35.559
Where a lot
of disposable phones would live.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.728
This guy the uncle
of the lance corporal?

21:37.730 --> 21:38.963
Cousin.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.432
Brandon singer.
Purchased a phone

21:41.434 --> 21:43.367
At a drugstore
down the street.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.336
Paid with a
credit card.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.538
This is his
home address.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.540
What else?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.809
Well, haven't had time
to dig up much, but,

21:51.811 --> 21:54.011
Apparently, he owns some sort of

21:54.013 --> 21:56.314
Alternative energy company.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.987
Mcgee:
So, when was the last time
you saw your cousin?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.488
What's going on?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.724
Chad in some kind of
trouble or something?

22:06.726 --> 22:08.025
If you could answer
the question.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.760
Yeah, we were supposed
to go hiking.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.330
Chad called to cancel, said
he had something else to do.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.365
Why the disposable phone?

22:14.367 --> 22:16.667
(chuckles)
yeah. I-I lost my phone
a few days ago.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.369
I was hoping it might show up.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.971
You know her?

22:23.041 --> 22:24.742
Son of a bitch,
he did it.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.011
Did what, mr. Singer?
(sighs)

22:27.013 --> 22:29.447
He's been talking about running
off with her for months.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.981
Her name's
lyla cutwright.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.350
She's chad's girlfriend.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.053
Hmm. You sure about that?
Yeah,

22:36.055 --> 22:37.822
They keep it quiet. Uh...

22:37.824 --> 22:39.890
Our families...
(chuckles)

22:39.892 --> 22:41.726
They don't exactly get along.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.060
How long have
they been together?

22:43.062 --> 22:46.063
Six months?
They hadn't seen each other

22:46.065 --> 22:47.565
Since they were kids,
but then...

22:47.567 --> 22:49.066
Chad, he found these, uh...

22:49.068 --> 22:51.869
These letters that lyla's dad
wrote to his mom.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.039
And he knew the guy
owned a dry cleaners shop,

22:55.041 --> 22:56.540
So he went there
to confront him.

22:56.542 --> 23:00.678
Lyla's dad wasn't there
but, uh, lyla was.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.380
I swear to god, when
you guys find him,

23:02.382 --> 23:03.447
I'm gonna
wring his neck.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.850
There was an accident,
mr. Singer.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.552
Your cousin
and miss cutwright...

23:08.554 --> 23:10.488
Were killed.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.560
I'm sorry.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.596
Listen, I know
this is difficult, but...

23:18.598 --> 23:20.398
If you could tell us,
did anyone else know

23:20.400 --> 23:21.632
About their relationship?

23:21.634 --> 23:23.634
Uh...

23:23.636 --> 23:25.770
The more people
that knew about it,

23:25.772 --> 23:28.606
The more likely my uncle walter
would find out.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.675
Chad was afraid
what his father might do if...

23:41.520 --> 23:44.422
Good morrow, fellow humans.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.791
(chuckles)
you have a bushy tail
this morning.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.626
Thank you for noticing.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.027
(sighs)

23:50.029 --> 23:52.696
There's nothing like recharging
the old battery

23:52.698 --> 23:53.998
In the great outdoors.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.667
Did you find anything out there?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.436
No murder weapon,

23:58.438 --> 23:59.637
But I...

23:59.639 --> 24:00.971
I did find a little inner peace.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.040
Where's the boss man?
I'd... Like to thank him.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.575
Uh, he got here early.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.445
He has been in with walter dunn
for over an hour.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.946
You think dunn could be our guy?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.681
It is possible.
I saw his temper.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.583
He could have seen his son
with lyla cutwright

24:12.585 --> 24:14.785
And then just... Snapped.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.187
Dunn said he didn't do it.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.955
Well, does he have an alibi?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.990
He said he was home
with his wife.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.091
And you believe him?

24:21.093 --> 24:22.126
Well, I believe he's not

24:22.128 --> 24:23.661
Gonna say any different.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.030
(sighs)
is there anything
we can do, boss?

24:26.032 --> 24:27.631
Yeah.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.134
Abby left a message--
she called in sick.

24:32.504 --> 24:33.871
What kind of sick?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.807
Boss, abby hasn't called
in sick in...
Ever.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.576
We can't get anybody in
until tomorrow,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.010
So we're gonna have to cover.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.479
For abby?

24:41.481 --> 24:43.647
Dinozzo, ziva,

24:43.649 --> 24:44.882
See where she was
with the evidence.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.484
On it, boss.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.619
Mcgee, ducky's got new swabs

24:48.621 --> 24:51.021
From the lance corporal.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.923
We just may have
the attacker's dna.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.625
Oh, no, no, no.
No, boss.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.060
Mass spec is very loyal.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.895
Maybe abby'll
work a half day.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.497
I could come and back you up

24:59.499 --> 25:03.767
No, no, no, no.
I'm not going back in there.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.769
You're not?

25:05.771 --> 25:08.506
Meredith:
Thanks.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.543
I want to thank you for being
so kind to me, agent gibbs.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.144
Eh, coffee
isn't hard.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.647
No, it's just, with
everything that's going on,

25:16.649 --> 25:19.216
I'm not sure I could
handle hearing one more...

25:19.218 --> 25:21.552
Angry word.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.656
It's understandable,
your husband being upset.

25:25.658 --> 25:29.193
Can I ask you what you're
talking to him about?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.861
I know you told us
he was right,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.531
That chad didn't
do this, but...

25:33.533 --> 25:35.933
Chad and lyla together...

25:35.935 --> 25:38.068
I'm more interested
in talking to you.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.538
To me?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.740
Why?

25:42.742 --> 25:45.175
Because you're
a good mother, mrs. Dunn.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.811
You put your son's needs
ahead of your own.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.547
(sighs)

25:49.549 --> 25:52.550
Scott told you
about our letters.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.052
Well, if your husband
didn't know about it before,

25:55.054 --> 25:56.754
He knows about it now.

25:57.689 --> 26:00.691
It doesn't matter.

26:00.693 --> 26:04.762
The only thing that matters
is that chad is gone.

26:05.697 --> 26:10.100
When he was a little boy...

26:10.102 --> 26:14.738
He used to grab my hand
whenever someone talked to him.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.107
That's all I can think about.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.311
All we want to do
is keep 'em close.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.713
Yeah.

26:22.715 --> 26:26.584
The only way to protect chad
is to get justice for him.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.752
What do you mean?

26:28.754 --> 26:31.822
I need to know if your husband
was with you at home

26:31.824 --> 26:33.691
At the time of the crash.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.660
Agent gibbs,

26:36.662 --> 26:39.797
I don't have an ounce of love
left for the man,

26:39.799 --> 26:42.299
But he didn't kill anyone.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.736
Yes. He was at home with me.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.874
Ziva:
Okay, moving on to box y-14.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.142
Item number...

26:52.144 --> 26:53.677
0-2-2-3.

26:53.679 --> 26:54.945
Jumper cables.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.615
Green dash, purple star...

26:57.617 --> 27:00.184
Means it's been bagged
but not yet inspected.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.819
Well, it's been
inspected now,

27:01.821 --> 27:03.053
So mark it off.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.323
Tony.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.392
I'm trying.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.061
How hard is it to
make a check mark?

27:11.063 --> 27:12.830
Well, the wrong color check mark
in the z-4 quadrant

27:12.832 --> 27:13.998
And you got a whole mess

27:14.000 --> 27:15.799
Because everything
gets lined up and then...

27:17.702 --> 27:19.069
I sound a little like abby,
don't I?

27:20.038 --> 27:21.972
She can fix it later.

27:23.274 --> 27:26.276
It's weird doing this stuff
without her, isn't it?

27:26.278 --> 27:28.846
(sighs)
it's like going
to a puppet show,

27:28.848 --> 27:31.849
Except all the puppets are just
laying there on the stage...

27:31.851 --> 27:33.684
Just dead puppets.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.054
Sorry.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.289
Why are you sorry?

27:39.291 --> 27:41.191
Just...

27:41.193 --> 27:43.894
My father dies,
and all of a sudden

27:43.896 --> 27:46.096
You cannot talk to me
about dead puppets?

27:49.200 --> 27:51.201
I'm fine, tony.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.237
Why would anyone have

27:53.239 --> 27:55.339
A nice notebook like this
in their car

27:55.341 --> 27:57.141
And never use it?

27:57.143 --> 27:58.942
It's a "guy of import"
accessory.

27:58.944 --> 28:00.177
A what?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.780
Yeah. 'cause say you're
a young guy, you know,

28:02.782 --> 28:04.782
But you want
to be taken seriously.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.052
So what do you do? What do you
bring with you to meetings

28:08.054 --> 28:09.820
And interviews,
even a coffee shop?

28:09.822 --> 28:12.122
You're the guy with
the leather-bound folder, baby.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.424
Guy of import.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.260
Coffee shop.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.861
See what I'm saying?
(chuckles)

28:17.863 --> 28:19.863
(sighs)
that fresh air put the magic

28:19.865 --> 28:22.766
Right back in me.

28:23.735 --> 28:26.170
Bank receipt
for a cash withdrawal.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.973
Why didn't mcgee
flag this already?

28:29.975 --> 28:32.443
Mm. 15 grand
for a lance corporal?

28:32.445 --> 28:34.411
It's got to mean something.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.982
(loud, rackety whirring)
crap.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.118
Boss. Sorry, I was just...

28:41.120 --> 28:42.386
What do you got, mcgee?

28:42.388 --> 28:44.388
Well, I, uh... I was looking

28:44.390 --> 28:45.823
Through
the cutwrights' computer.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.324
Nothing yet.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.327
Um, I was just
trying to...

28:50.329 --> 28:51.895
Boss, I've got problems.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.131
I tried calling abby,
but she's not picking up.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.900
What did you do?

28:56.902 --> 29:00.003
Well, I put the swabs from dunn
into major mass spec,

29:00.005 --> 29:04.007
And-and I thought I did
everything right, but he...

29:04.009 --> 29:06.310
(quietly):
I don't think he likes me.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.312
He say something to you, mcgee?

29:08.314 --> 29:11.348
Well, when abby runs it, it-it
makes more of purring noise.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.450
But all I'm hearing is a growl.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.252
You know what?

29:15.254 --> 29:18.088
Abby keeps an <i>abby's</i>
<i>lab for dummies</i>

29:18.090 --> 29:20.157
Around here in
her office.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.959
(loud, rackety whirring)
got it.

29:21.961 --> 29:28.132
(whirring worsens)
looks like she came out
with a revised edition.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.270
That you on the cover?
Yep.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.404
I always get the cover.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.540
Abby...

29:36.542 --> 29:38.308
She's the only one
that can call you a dummy

29:38.310 --> 29:40.444
And make you feel like you've
won something at the same time.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.114
Boss...

29:44.116 --> 29:45.849
Find her.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.918
And make sure she's okay.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.524

30:13.312 --> 30:16.079
Do you mind taking over

30:16.081 --> 30:18.148
Honey, I thought
you'd never ask.
Okay.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.020
B-2.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.588
All:
Buckle my shoe.

You're not an easy
person to track down.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.498
Didn't you just...

30:34.500 --> 30:36.300
Ping my phone?

30:36.302 --> 30:38.902
Yeah. It was pretty easy.

30:38.904 --> 30:42.306
I, um, just didn't know what
to say when you walked up.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.242
Dolores:
N-35.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.845
Are you feeling any better?

30:47.847 --> 30:50.147
I'm, um...

30:50.149 --> 30:52.983
I'm not actually sick.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.384
Yeah, I know.
Dolores:

30:59.358 --> 31:03.126
Guess it's not really going
all that well, huh?

31:03.128 --> 31:04.394
B-1.
Well, we're kind of

31:04.396 --> 31:06.363

Wait, abby.

34:17.321 --> 34:18.688
Abby.

34:25.596 --> 34:26.630
Talk to me.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.365
Swabs from dunn were a bust.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.334
Receipt found in his folder
was for 15 large.

34:31.336 --> 34:32.602
Withdrawal happened
last November.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.438
But it was not made
by the lance corporal.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.772
Cash came from a
trust fund account

34:35.774 --> 34:36.773
Set up for
lyla cutwright

34:36.775 --> 34:38.408
By her great aunt.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.178
Cutwright gained access to it
when she turned 19.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.481
Because it was closed before
being linked to her name.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.383
Her father?
Tony:
Had no idea

34:46.385 --> 34:48.452
About the withdrawal,
couldn't imagine why.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.786
Found some job searches
on the cutwrights' home computer

34:49.788 --> 34:50.787
That mr. Cutwright

34:50.789 --> 34:52.756
Can't account for--

34:52.758 --> 34:54.558
All for oceanside, california.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.260
Lance corporal
was headed to pendleton.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.329
They weren't running.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.730
She was gonna move with him.

35:00.732 --> 35:01.765
Perhaps they were
using the money

35:01.767 --> 35:03.567
For a down payment
on a house.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.335
$15k in oceanside?

35:05.337 --> 35:07.270
Well, they
tried for more.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.772
Same week
of cutwright's withdrawal,

35:08.774 --> 35:11.608
Dunn applied for a personal loan
for $5,000.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.110
Using available
funds is one thing,

35:13.112 --> 35:14.377
But applying for a loan--

35:14.379 --> 35:15.712
I mean, what could have been
so important?

35:15.714 --> 35:17.481
Both of you, get me
someone from the bank.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.318
Hey, you talk
to abby?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.753
Yeah, it didn't help.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.693
(laughs)
he came in

35:29.695 --> 35:31.394
With his girlfriend.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.296
No, I remember him well.

35:33.298 --> 35:36.399
Marine uniform, well-spoken,
everything all organized

35:36.401 --> 35:37.767
In a leather-bound folder.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.437
I liked him
immediately,

35:40.439 --> 35:42.239
But I couldn't give him
a loan.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.273
Why not?

35:43.275 --> 35:44.508
No credit history,

35:44.510 --> 35:46.676
And on his salary I had doubts

35:46.678 --> 35:48.411
About his ability
to pay it back.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.313
You know what he was
looking to spend it on?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.315
He said he and his girlfriend
were on their own.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.784
He wanted to make sure
he could give her a good life.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.786
They were so sweet
to each other.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.455
You know how
some people just look

35:58.457 --> 36:01.291
Like they belong
together?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.425
$5k wouldn't go very far.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.294
He said he was planning
on investing it,

36:04.296 --> 36:08.665
Called it a great
opportunity, but...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.433
He showed me some paperwork.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.701
I-it didn't look right.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.470
Accounted
for cash flow only,

36:13.472 --> 36:14.671
No assets.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.839
I told him
to be careful,

36:15.841 --> 36:17.874
But he said
he trusted his contact.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.609
Contact have a name?

36:19.611 --> 36:21.545
No, but he did say

36:21.547 --> 36:22.712
The company had
something to do

36:22.714 --> 36:26.449
With some kind
of solar stuff.

36:26.451 --> 36:28.785

36:32.591 --> 36:34.891
I don't understand.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.594
Have you heard
of a warrant?

36:37.596 --> 36:39.329
A warrant-- what for?

36:39.331 --> 36:41.865
To search your computer, company
books, files and statements.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.601
The name ponzi mean
anything to you?

36:44.603 --> 36:46.870
Are you going to arrest me?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.505
Your cousin and lyla cutwright
gave you

36:48.507 --> 36:50.941
$15,000 for you to invest?

36:50.943 --> 36:52.742
Yeah.
Gibbs:
Three months later

36:52.744 --> 36:54.311
They never saw
the returns you promised.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.379
I told them I was going
to get them some money.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.448
Okay, I just needed...

36:58.450 --> 37:00.217
What, more investors
for you to con?

37:01.552 --> 37:03.253
Lyla threatened
to call the police.

37:03.255 --> 37:05.422
What did you say
to get her to hang up?

37:05.424 --> 37:06.923
What does that mean?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.491
I told her the truth,
okay, I told 'em

37:08.493 --> 37:11.795
Yeah, but you had no money
to give so you killed 'em.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.929
What?

37:12.931 --> 37:14.864
No, no, no way.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.334

okay, I did it--

37:17.336 --> 37:19.603

never hurt chad.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.441
You're not always around

40:44.443 --> 40:47.076
To see the difference
it makes later.

40:49.046 --> 40:51.648
I don't know, gibbs.

40:51.650 --> 40:55.018
Abbs, first day we met.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.723
It was a Thursday--

41:00.725 --> 41:03.860
70 degrees,
mostly sunny.

41:05.529 --> 41:07.997
What about it?
What'd you give me?

41:08.966 --> 41:13.236
I had chinese food

41:13.238 --> 41:16.005
And I gave you the fortune
from my cookie.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.074
Because?

41:19.477 --> 41:22.846
Because I wanted it
to be about you.

41:29.019 --> 41:31.087
The fortune.

41:32.122 --> 41:34.557
You kept it.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.630
The things you do...

41:40.632 --> 41:42.699
Mean something to people.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.581
♪

42:14.265 --> 42:16.266
What's wrong?

42:18.569 --> 42:20.637
I couldn't fix it.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.113
Fix what?

42:32.116 --> 42:35.552
Ricki will never see
her grandpa again.

42:35.554 --> 42:37.554
But you did good.

42:37.556 --> 42:39.122
You gave her your rabbit.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.859
She won't forget
that, abby.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.762
She won't.

42:58.976 --> 43:03.146
