00:01.875 --> 00:03.875
[Samantha] "Be yourself."

00:03.875 --> 00:07.208
Can't watch TV without getting
that little pearl of wisdom.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.417
But how can you be yourself
if you don't know who you are?

00:10.417 --> 00:15.125
Nobody ever thinks of the
amnesiacs. We need a lobby.

00:15.125 --> 00:18.375
So some guy is just
flying you to Rome?

00:18.375 --> 00:21.917
My big news today was that I
remembered what my manicurist's
name was.

00:21.917 --> 00:23.834
- Ling.
- Lee.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.834
Well, yeah. And I know.
It's Ling Lee.

00:26.834 --> 00:30.667
- [knocking on door]
- [zipper zipping]

00:33.000 --> 00:34.333
Hi, Todd.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.834
Were you running? I've been
wanting to try running.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.834
Maybe next time
I'll go with you.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.875
Oh, but you already have
a running buddy. Hi.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.667
Hi.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.208
So... What's up?

00:47.208 --> 00:49.875
Oh, Andrea wants to borrow
one of my tops.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.834
Yeah, it matches the seats
of the private jet I'm taking
to Rome.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.291
Awesome.

00:55.291 --> 01:00.083
She'll be quick. I'm really
sorry to interrupt your date.

01:00.083 --> 01:03.583
Oh, that's OK. We were
at a good stopping point.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.291
I'm Chloe.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.834
Oh, hi.
Sorry, I'm Todd's...

01:08.834 --> 01:12.458
- Friend.
- Friend.
I'm Todd's friend, Samantha.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.667
- Oh. Is this one...?
- Yeah.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.417
Who? Who am I?

01:16.417 --> 01:20.834
Wow, she really doesn't remember
anything! Oh, you poor thing.

01:20.834 --> 01:24.542
Oh, come here.
Yeah, yeah.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.208
What kind of shampoo is that?

01:29.208 --> 01:32.750
Comfort Inn Hotel
and Meeting Center brand.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.959
Yeah. My dad brought it back
from a chicken farming
conference.

01:35.959 --> 01:37.750
Todd, get in here,
smell this.

01:37.750 --> 01:40.417
No, I'd rather not.
We should get ready for dinner.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.000
[shouting] I'm so glad...

01:43.000 --> 01:45.625
...I got to meet you.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.834
Oh...

01:51.834 --> 01:56.500
- So did you mean what you said?
That we're friends?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.834
Good. I'm glad. I'm glad.
You know, because people
need friends. Buddies.

02:00.834 --> 02:05.667
Amigos, chums.
[with accent] 'Ello, mate!

02:05.667 --> 02:07.959
- [with accent] 'Ello!
- [with accent] How are you?

02:07.959 --> 02:10.875
- OK, now that's enough.
- Yeah, right. I went too far.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.834
What are you doing? I thought
you were getting one thing.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.834
What do you care? You don't
remember buying this stuff.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.500
All right.
Well, enjoy your dinner.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.834
Sam, do you want
to go with us?

02:26.125 --> 02:28.792
Uh... No, thank you.
No, thank you.

02:28.792 --> 02:30.750
Date night. Yeah.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.041
You're not the only one
with a life, you know.

02:33.041 --> 02:36.166
You crazy kid, you.
You crazy kids.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.166
[all chuckling]

02:41.959 --> 02:46.458
Oh! You landed on "Get Married."
You get to put a blue peg in
your car.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.834
I don't want a blue peg.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.083
It's a rule.
You get to marry the blue peg.

02:50.083 --> 02:53.959
Then I call "new rule." And I
say that the blue peg and I can
just be friends.

02:53.959 --> 02:57.875
And then I'll get married when
and if that ever even happens.

02:57.875 --> 03:01.000
You're never gonna get a date
if you stay at home all night.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.041
- What?
- Honey, marriage
doesn't just happen.

03:05.041 --> 03:07.333
Get out there and expose
yourself to it.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.959
Like chickenpox.

03:08.959 --> 03:12.583
I wish I had done that with you.
I'm still worried you'll catch
it and die.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.667
I do expose myself, OK?
I go out.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.208
Dena and I are going out
on Monday.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.583
Because appetizers are free
for ladies.

03:20.583 --> 03:24.834
Samantha, I mean this truly
and deeply, you are a very
pretty girl.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.917
But you've got maybe three years
left. Five tops. Go find a man.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.875
- No.
- OK, fine.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.875
Do you remember this?

03:32.875 --> 03:36.041
I do! That is Samantha's
peewee hockey trophy.

03:36.041 --> 03:40.834
That's right, Dena.
You have a good memory.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.625
Samantha, don't you remember?
You were the only girl with
all these boys.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.542
Jimmy Fesdin is now a girl.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.625
You weren't afraid
of anything.

03:48.625 --> 03:51.500
Except that babysitter
with the mechanical voice box.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.667
Now you're afraid
to go on a simple date.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.625
I don't know anything
about myself.

03:55.625 --> 03:58.625
I would have absolutely nothing
to add to a conversation.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.834
Stop that kind of talk.

03:59.834 --> 04:03.458
I did not raise you
to use amnesia as an excuse.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.250
That would have taken
enormous foresight.

04:06.250 --> 04:09.166
Besides a date isn't
an inquisition.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.667
It's just a polite chat,
about nothing.

04:12.667 --> 04:16.959
OK. OK. Dena? Why don't you
pretend that we're on a date?

04:16.959 --> 04:19.667
No. I'm not dressed
for a date.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.625
You look lovely.
Now go ahead.

04:22.625 --> 04:26.291
Why don't you ask me
what my favorite movie is?

04:26.291 --> 04:30.834
OK. [clears throat]

04:30.834 --> 04:32.917
- What's your favorite...?
- Hard to say.

04:32.917 --> 04:35.917
Now ask me
where I went to summer camp.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.834
- Where did you...?
- No idea.

04:37.834 --> 04:41.667
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ask me
where I got this scar on my toe.

04:43.041 --> 04:46.208
- Where'd you get that...?
- I don't know.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.709
So how's the date going
so far?

04:48.709 --> 04:51.500
Not crazy about how you keep
cutting me off because...

04:51.500 --> 04:53.875
- See?
- A pet peeve.

04:53.875 --> 04:56.625
I thought you were
engaging and charming.

04:56.625 --> 05:00.834
Just don't talk about your
scars. It makes you sound like
a sea captain.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.542
[whistling]

05:09.834 --> 05:13.000
- [screams] Oh!
- Whoa! Are you all right?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.667
Oh, Samantha, stop fooling
around and get up off the floor.
Dinner's ready.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.834
- Howard! She's home!
- Who's that?

05:19.834 --> 05:24.208
Kevin. He's just giving us an
estimate on re-doing the floors.
Sit. Howard!

05:24.208 --> 05:26.792
What's with all the yelling?
All you do is yell.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.583
I yell because you insist
on being in different rooms.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.667
- Why is the table set for four?
- Kevin!

05:31.667 --> 05:34.792
- What are you doing?
- Yelling.
It's how she communicates.

05:34.792 --> 05:38.166
You know, Kevin, I've made far
too much food. I hope you'll
join us.

05:38.166 --> 05:41.875
- [Kevin] That's really
not necessary.
- I insist. Sit right there.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.333
Isn't this nice?

05:50.709 --> 05:52.792
Lord, thank you
for this wonderful...

05:52.792 --> 05:55.166
Howard, we're going
to be late for the theater.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.625
- What?
- No. No. What are you doing?

05:57.625 --> 06:01.625
Your father and I completely
forgot we have tickets to go see
Mamma Mia!

06:01.625 --> 06:06.000
So you kids can just stay here
and have a lovely dinner.
Howard, we have to go.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.834
Mother. Hi.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.917
If it's that experimental stuff
or in the round, you can count
me out.

06:12.917 --> 06:16.875
Howard, we are not going to the
theater. Just get in the car.

06:18.417 --> 06:19.875
[door shuts]

06:22.458 --> 06:26.500
Well, that was... unusual.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.250
Oh, I wish it were.

06:52.875 --> 06:56.083
- Sorry. Moms.
- Oh, got one.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.583
You don't have to stay. You can
take the meat if you want.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.875
That's OK.
It would get cold.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.083
Right. Would get cold.

07:04.083 --> 07:08.250
- So tell me about yourself.
- No.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.083
I'm... sorry.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.750
- You first.
- OK.

07:13.750 --> 07:17.375
Boxer-briefs. Right foot's
a tiny bit shorter than my left.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.875
If you're turned off by
extremely handsome, sexy,
funny guys

07:20.875 --> 07:24.333
who own their own business,
then maybe I'm not the right guy
for you.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.333
[chuckles]

07:27.917 --> 07:29.083
OK, your turn.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.458
I played hockey.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.083
- No way.
- Yeah.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.375
With a boy who is now a girl.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.959
Get out of here. Well, I love
hockey. Are you a Blackhawks
fan?

07:42.959 --> 07:44.750
Nope. Just hockey.

07:44.750 --> 07:48.417
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's
been a tough year. You any good?

07:48.417 --> 07:49.792
I have a trophy.

07:49.792 --> 07:52.083
Wow. Well,
tell me about that.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.208
It's shiny.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.291
Yeah, I mean what did
you get it for?

07:57.291 --> 07:58.792
Hockey.

07:58.792 --> 08:02.291
OK. A hockey fan
and a smartass.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.709
- Score.
- Score.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.458
- Hey, morning.
- Hello.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.083
Hey, is that my dress?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.125
I'm testing your clothes
out for Rome.

08:17.125 --> 08:20.875
Wanna see what gets the least
attention so I know what not
to bring.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.083
At lunch I'm going to Old Town.
I wanna see if these heels work
on cobblestones.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.667
Uh... Um...
Miss Newly? Um...

08:26.667 --> 08:31.083
- [stuttering]
- [mimicking stutter]
Say it already.

08:31.083 --> 08:34.166
I told you that when you do that
it just makes her take longer.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.583
Yes, what is it, Tracy?

08:35.583 --> 08:40.166
There is a guy named Kevin here.
Is it OK to send him up?

08:40.166 --> 08:44.667
Kevin? Oh, God.
I don't know. Yes.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.667
No. Wait.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.083
OK, who is Kevin?

08:52.083 --> 08:54.583
This poor guy that
my mom tried to set me up with.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.333
What if he's here
to ask me out?

08:56.333 --> 08:58.333
So go out with him.
Is he cute?

08:58.333 --> 09:01.083
Yes. But forget it.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.625
I mean, I barely made it
through the evening.

09:03.625 --> 09:07.125
I kept saying, "I like hockey,"
like a mental patient.

09:07.125 --> 09:11.041
This is why I can't go out on
dates, because one dinner and
I'm just sweating

09:11.041 --> 09:15.083
and exhausted from trying to
make some stranger think I'm
something I'm not.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.709
Sweetheart, that is a date.

09:16.709 --> 09:18.375
[knock on door]

09:18.375 --> 09:20.375
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

09:20.375 --> 09:24.250
Was that a, "Yes, send him up,"
or a, "No, don't send him up."

09:24.250 --> 09:26.000
Yes.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Um... "Yes, send him up,"
or "Yes, don't send him up?"

09:30.000 --> 09:31.083
Um...

09:33.625 --> 09:36.959
Look at you.
Do you like this guy?

09:36.959 --> 09:39.083
I don't know. He's nice.

09:39.083 --> 09:42.083
What I'm asking is
what does he do for a living?

09:42.083 --> 09:44.291
He owns a hardwood floor
company.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.750
- Oh, so you hate him.
- [knock on door]

09:48.458 --> 09:50.709
Hi, am I interrupting?

09:50.709 --> 09:52.500
No, come on in. Come.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.875
Kevin, this is Andrea.
Andrea, Kevin.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.750
Hello, nice to meet you.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.375
- Nice boots.
- Andrea can't stay.

10:00.375 --> 10:04.709
Yes, yes, my new boyfriend
is flying me to Italy.

10:04.709 --> 10:09.875
- [speaks Italian]
- [speaking Italian rapidly]

10:11.667 --> 10:13.083
OK.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.291
So... I was wondering

10:19.291 --> 10:22.917
if you would like to go to a
Blackhawks game with me tomorrow
night.

10:22.917 --> 10:28.125
Oh, gosh, Kevin...
I don't know.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.041
OK. Well, why don't you
just think about it.

10:31.041 --> 10:33.375
In the meantime,
I got you a little something.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.500
A present? Really?

10:37.083 --> 10:40.083
Oh, that's so sweet!

10:40.083 --> 10:43.083
- It's got your name
on the back.
- Oh.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.917
Oh, Kevin.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.500
Nice of you.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.500
- So you said yes
to the handyman?
- [Samantha] Yes.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.000
And I discovered something about
myself today. I like presents.
A lot.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.291
But now I need someone to teach
me everything about hockey in
one day.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.125
- [with accent] 'Ello, mate!
- [sighs deeply]

11:14.625 --> 11:18.333
[Samantha] You have to!
You said you were my friend.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.291
OK, so after dating me for three
years and cheating on me,

11:21.291 --> 11:24.583
now you want me to teach you
about hockey to impress some
new guy?

11:24.583 --> 11:26.583
I know!
Are you a good friend or what?

11:26.583 --> 11:28.583
If he knows
you have amnesia,

11:28.583 --> 11:31.250
wouldn't he understand
you don't remember hockey?

11:31.250 --> 11:32.583
Yes.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.792
- You didn't tell him
you have amnesia.
- No.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.583
Because?

11:36.583 --> 11:40.083
There are four million hot girls
in this city who don't have
amnesia.

11:40.083 --> 11:44.375
He likes me. The only thing that
I have to offer him is my
passion for hockey.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.291
- Which you don't have.
- Now you see my problem.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.583
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.208
There's a hockey game tonight.
It's puck night,

11:52.208 --> 11:55.417
everyone who goes gets a free
puck. Is that good?

11:55.417 --> 11:58.041
I can't. I have plans
with Chloe.

11:58.041 --> 12:02.041
Oh! Going to go
for a little run, are you?

12:02.041 --> 12:06.333
All right, well, I guess, only
one of us gets to move on.
That's cool.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.959
But, you know, if I did
start seeing someone,

12:08.959 --> 12:13.041
I probably wouldn't
come around here so often, so...

12:13.041 --> 12:16.166
- [ticking]
- Let's go before
they run out of pucks.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.333
[indistinct chattering]

12:20.333 --> 12:22.709
- [up-tempo music plays]
- Oh!

12:22.709 --> 12:25.583
Hi, you! Hey, I didn't know
you were partying with us.

12:25.583 --> 12:29.000
I'm not! I don't know you!

12:31.667 --> 12:35.208
- Oh! [chuckles]
- Where's Samantha?

12:35.208 --> 12:37.625
- I've been trying her cell.
- She's not here yet.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.542
I thought you were
going to Rome.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.583
Decided not to.
What are you drinking?

12:41.583 --> 12:42.625
- Vodka.
- Give it.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.583
- Why didn't you want to go?
- I had too much work.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.125
Oh... Yeah,
but it's Rome!

12:55.125 --> 12:58.417
- It was also
my mother's birthday.
- Oh, she would've understood.

12:58.417 --> 13:02.000
He left without me, OK?
How stupid are you?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.834
- Oh, it's OK.
- Don't hug me.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.625
Just rub my arm.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.917
Your two best seats,
please.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.417
So what did you tell Chloe
you were doing tonight?

13:18.417 --> 13:20.834
Going out
with the guys bowling?

13:20.834 --> 13:24.583
- No. I told her the truth.
- Oh.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.250
Whatever floats your boat.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.709
Ma'am, I can't sell you tickets.
You've been banned from this
arena.

13:30.709 --> 13:34.625
What?
What do you mean? Wait!

13:34.625 --> 13:36.709
What's going on?
Wait! Wait!

13:36.709 --> 13:39.458
I don't even know what I did!
Wait, I can walk!

13:39.458 --> 13:43.125
OK, please, just let go.
I can walk! I can... Oh, crap.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.875
[indistinct cheering]

13:46.917 --> 13:50.625
Oh! [laughs] Yeah.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.750
Come on. Come on. You got it!
Get it! Free shot!

13:55.583 --> 13:58.583
[all cheering]

14:03.083 --> 14:06.208
[man] Hey, she's not
handicapped!

14:07.250 --> 14:09.875
Oh, my God! I can walk!

14:09.875 --> 14:11.583
[crowd booing]

14:11.583 --> 14:15.166
You're just jealous you didn't
think... Yeah! Is that the best
you can do?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.583
- Let's go.
- Oh, come on, man.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.709
Oh, all right. OK, OK.

14:22.709 --> 14:25.208
What about my free puck?
Huh?

14:27.208 --> 14:30.291
- [rock music plays]
- [indistinct chattering]

14:30.291 --> 14:32.667
[Samantha] Pretending
to be handicapped.

14:32.667 --> 14:37.625
Oh, wow, if Kevin were with me
tonight he would think this was
so attractive.

14:37.625 --> 14:41.458
"Hey, you're a liar and a bad
person. You want to go to Bali?

14:41.458 --> 14:44.583
Wait, what's that?
You're banned from Asia? Sweet!"

14:44.583 --> 14:48.583
At least I know why that
wheelchair is covered in
stickers from all our teams.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.792
No, this is good, though.
This is good.

14:50.792 --> 14:53.250
This is good, now I can
move on to my next plan,

14:53.250 --> 14:56.333
which is to stay at home and
take care of my aging parents,

14:56.333 --> 14:59.583
and then I'm going to get a cat
that I swear thinks it's people.

14:59.583 --> 15:00.959
You're just gonna give up?

15:00.959 --> 15:04.875
Yeah. Yeah, that's
a key part of the plan.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.375
Hey, remember the goose?

15:08.375 --> 15:12.291
No. And as a rallying cry,
that needs a little work.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.166
No, last summer we were in
Lincoln Park and this goose
stole your watch.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.875
- How could a goose
steal my watch?
- You had it off.

15:18.875 --> 15:21.500
You know, we were...
You know.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.959
- We were running?
- Yeah. Yeah, so...

15:24.959 --> 15:28.875
So you chased this poor,
screaming bird halfway
across the park.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.583
Trying to get my watch back.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.875
- [squawking]
- Give me that watch!

15:34.875 --> 15:37.792
And you refused to quit
until you got what you wanted.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.709
That's one thing
I always admired about you.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.959
So what happened
with the goose?

15:45.959 --> 15:47.959
It bit you on your toe.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.917
My scar.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.625
Wow. I must have really
loved that watch.

15:53.625 --> 15:57.583
It's the one you're wearing
right now.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.458
I gave it to you
for your birthday.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.375
Oh.

16:06.291 --> 16:09.583
So...
you want to throw darts?

16:09.583 --> 16:11.834
OK. At what?

16:13.291 --> 16:16.834
- You OK, now?
- Yeah.

16:16.834 --> 16:20.000
I'm only crying
because I'm tired, got that?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.041
I've been staying up trying
to get my body on Rome time.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.709
Must be hard for somebody like
you to admit they've been jerked
around.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.375
What do you mean?

16:28.375 --> 16:33.083
Someone, you know,
materialistic, vain,
self-absorbed.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.583
Strong, I know.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.959
You don't have to tell me
how awesome I am. Tell Edvard.

16:38.959 --> 16:42.250
Well, lots of men
can't handle a strong woman.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.750
- That's a good point, Tina.
- It's Dena.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.083
- Really? Has it always been?
- Yes.

16:50.083 --> 16:53.875
Huh. Anyway, Dena, so... Are you
sure? That does not sound right.

16:53.875 --> 16:57.583
- It's Dena! Hmm-mmm.
- Dena.

16:58.375 --> 17:00.291
OK. To strong women!

17:01.375 --> 17:02.875
And stop taking my drinks.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.667
Yes! [laughs]

17:07.667 --> 17:09.750
Three games in a row, Sally.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.166
I'm fresh off a coma
and I own you!

17:12.166 --> 17:15.041
I don't know why guys just
aren't lining up at your door.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.458
What was that?
I don't hear you. You know why?

17:17.458 --> 17:21.000
Because your girly voice
is just too sweet and high.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.417
No, but seriously,
look at you.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.834
Even with amnesia, you're fun
to be with, you're having a good
time.

17:26.834 --> 17:29.166
Yeah, with you.

17:29.166 --> 17:32.458
Man, if only you just had
amnesia, too, we'd be the
perfect couple.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.250
Samantha?

17:37.917 --> 17:39.709
Kevin! Hi!

17:39.709 --> 17:41.583
Hey! Were you at the game?

17:41.583 --> 17:44.458
Game? Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.709
It was great.
It was great. Yeah.

17:46.709 --> 17:50.917
Yeah, I gave my free puck to
this little kid. He was so cute.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.583
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Kevin.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.500
Oh, right.
I'm sorry, right.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.500
This is Kevin, this is my...

17:57.667 --> 18:02.458
- Her friend. Todd.
- My friend. Todd.

18:02.458 --> 18:05.625
Isn't it a sad day when
the Zamboni gets more cheers
than the team?

18:05.625 --> 18:08.291
Yeah. [chuckles nervously]

18:08.291 --> 18:12.792
Wait, isn't the Zamboni the big
machine that cleans the ice
after every period?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.458
Duh!

18:14.458 --> 18:18.083
Yeah, I'm teaching him
about the game. Not getting it.

18:19.625 --> 18:24.583
I should go. Hey, do me a favor?
Help her get out of here.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.417
She has a terrible sense
of direction.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.542
I am looking forward
to tomorrow night.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.583
By the way, don't get too
excited, but it is bobblehead
night.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.959
Hmm. Great.
Yeah, no, I'm fired up.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.959
OK, about that...

18:43.959 --> 18:47.000
Yeah. OK, here it goes.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.208
Um...

18:49.208 --> 18:50.875
I have amnesia.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.709
- Amnesia. In what way?
- Hmm-mmm.

18:53.709 --> 18:58.583
Well, in the, "I don't remember
what a bobblehead is" kind of
way.

18:58.583 --> 19:03.000
And you know what? If that
freaks you out, I completely
understand.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.625
But you know what? You'd be
missing out, because I have
a lot to offer.

19:06.625 --> 19:10.375
I don't know exactly what, but
some people seem to think so,

19:10.375 --> 19:13.583
and, you know,
I'm inclined to believe them.

19:13.583 --> 19:17.083
So don't expect me to twist
myself all up in a knot
to make you like me.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.583
Don't expect me to go tomorrow
to that hockey game.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.750
I happen to be banned
from that arena.

19:21.750 --> 19:25.875
If you have a problem with any
of this, then I'm just not the
person for you.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.750
[exhales deeply]

19:27.750 --> 19:29.625
You're the wheelchair girl!

19:30.875 --> 19:34.625
- Hey...!
- Ah! I might be. So?

19:34.625 --> 19:36.583
I was there!
I whipped a cup at your head.

19:36.583 --> 19:41.583
Great. Great.
So now you're what? Appalled?

19:41.583 --> 19:43.125
Turned on?

19:43.875 --> 19:45.583
I don't know.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.583
Well, not the first, but...

19:48.583 --> 19:50.291
...maybe the second.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.792
- Come on,
let me buy you a drink.
- OK.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.667
[Samantha] Remember I asked
how you can be yourself

19:58.667 --> 20:01.166
when you don't know
who you are?

20:01.166 --> 20:04.834
Well, I do know who I am.
I'm someone who happens
to have amnesia.

20:04.834 --> 20:08.500
And that's fine. Because every
day with me is an adventure.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.750
And if someone wants to take
that ride like Karen Allen did

20:11.750 --> 20:14.625
with Harrison Ford
in Raiders of the Lost Ark...

20:14.625 --> 20:19.166
Wait! OK, ask me my
favorite movie. Go ahead.

20:22.583 --> 20:26.375
Hey, hey, hey, I'm so sorry
I forgot about appetizer night.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.792
No calamari for you.
[giggling]

20:29.792 --> 20:32.583
She's fine.
Because she is strong.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.542
Hey, why aren't you in Rome?

20:34.542 --> 20:37.041
Because I am strong.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.583
Wait, what happened
with you and your handyman?

20:39.583 --> 20:43.083
Well, I...
I told him the truth.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.959
- Whoa.
- Yeah, I know!

20:44.959 --> 20:49.041
So I don't have to go to that
hockey game tomorrow night, but,
get this,

20:49.041 --> 20:54.250
he's going to take me to this
factory that makes nothing but
cheesecake.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.792
[laughs]

20:55.792 --> 20:58.625
- Lucky you.
- I know. I know.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.583
- To the truth!
- To the truth!

21:00.583 --> 21:02.333
The truth!

21:02.333 --> 21:06.291
These two guys, they think that
we're flight attendants from
Canada.

21:06.291 --> 21:10.291
- OK.
- Oh, oh, oh! And call me Tina.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.709
Ah... All right, Tina.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.291
Canada.

21:16.291 --> 21:20.959
[Canadian accent] So what are
you guys all talking about? Eh?
