WEBVTT

01:18.996 --> 01:21.112
How often do you do this?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.992
It's a little weird.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.373
You're... you're pregnant?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.166
We're pregnant?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.245
We are! We're pregnant.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.579
Mostly you, but I helped.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.220
Okay, okay.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.806
The preschools are better here,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.688
but I really want him or her
to go to high school in Smallville.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.189
And what about college?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.862
Do we want our child to study abroad?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.239
A broadened worldview is important,

01:58.327 --> 02:01.285
but people will notice
if I'm constantly patrolling Oxford.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.867
We have our entire lives

02:03.957 --> 02:06.323
to make all of those
wonderful decisions.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.626
But today we work, like always.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.872
I have to go get ready.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.484
It's Batman!

02:13.508 --> 02:14.508
Shoot him!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.124
Uh!

02:49.961 --> 02:50.961
Huh?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.122
Ahh!

02:55.967 --> 02:57.002
I had him.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.792
Nice to see you, too.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.502
And to what do I owe the pleasure?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.133
The joker is in Metropolis.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.430
I'm here to find out why.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.724
Joker. Right.

03:06.812 --> 03:07.972
I have news, Bruce.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.148
- Lois is pregnant.
- How...

03:13.235 --> 03:15.692
Your hands didn't tremble
when you faced doomsday.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.779
They are now.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.901
And you're grinning like an idiot.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.951
Well, I'll be. I'm terrified.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.824
Congratulations, Clark.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.281
I'll be out of your city
as soon as I find the joker.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.287
You mind cleaning this up?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.669
Every single time.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.138
Say "cheese."

03:54.943 --> 03:56.934
Something's wrong. Let's go.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.979
Just one more...

04:01.950 --> 04:03.440
Jimmy!

04:03.535 --> 04:07.323
Well, well, well.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.411
Imagine meeting you here, Lois.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.204
Vacation is so fun, puddin'.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.291
Only the very best for you, Harley.

04:23.889 --> 04:27.052
Ew... I got some Jimmy on my shoe.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.588
Lois.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.092
You were experimenting with kryptonite.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.597
Why?

05:06.681 --> 05:08.717
Well, no... not to hurt Superman.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.642
We wanted to know
if it could be used to cure disease

05:11.728 --> 05:13.264
or as a power source.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.186
We're scientists, not monsters.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.389
It's in the hands of monsters now.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.813
I want a list of every...

05:24.115 --> 05:25.115
I can't find Lois.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.906
I can't see her, I can't hear her.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.450
Superman, we're not alone.

05:31.957 --> 05:32.957
He has her?

05:33.708 --> 05:35.198
Help me. Please!

05:39.965 --> 05:42.456
This is a priority call
to all justice league members.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.088
I need as many of you
as we can spare in Metropolis.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.463
A woman is missing.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.297
You want the whole justice league
on a missing person case?

05:49.391 --> 05:52.724
Yes. We believe
she was taken by the joker.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.138
I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.228
Who is this woman, Batman?

06:01.319 --> 06:02.588
She's one of ours.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.477
Her name is Lois Lane.

06:04.573 --> 06:05.483
Lois.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.907
Diana, miss Lane
was last seen at the Metropolis docks.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.656
Find out if anyone saw her or the joker.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.986
I'll meet you there.

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
I'm on my way.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.140
Flash, we're searching
for Lois Lane in Metropolis.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.712
Superman is in the air.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.836
I need you to search
everything underground.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.007
On it.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.736
Batman, I found scarecrow.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.984
He's dead. Joker toxin.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.531
His lab has been ransacked.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.531
Something's wrong.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.123
Ugh. Can't move...

06:59.920 --> 07:04.459
Rest in pieces.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.457
Argh!

07:10.555 --> 07:12.466
Huh!

07:12.891 --> 07:14.301
Flash, come in.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.392
Flash!

07:15.977 --> 07:18.093
The joker is no longer in Metropolis.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.304
He's stolen a submarine
with Harley Quinn.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.892
They took Lois with them.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.688
I see it.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.445
Batman, one of the warheads is missing.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.611
Where is she?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.036
Doomsday.

08:18.957 --> 08:19.957
Nol

08:20.041 --> 08:22.874
I will not let you hurt anyone!

08:30.260 --> 08:33.001
Time to go, honey.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.179
Good guys are coming
and they tend to get punchy.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.847
Huh?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.433
You're not going anywhere.

08:46.443 --> 08:50.937
Scarecrow's fear toxin,
mixed with kryptonite particles.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.567
What did you do?

08:53.658 --> 08:56.695
I'm pulling the best joke ever.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.904
It'll be my masterpiece!

09:06.713 --> 09:09.079
Superman, stop.
Whatever you're seeing,

09:09.174 --> 09:10.584
it's not real.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.591
Ta-da!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.088
Brace yourselves!

10:14.280 --> 10:15.611
You took his wife.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.825
You took his unborn child and his city.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.903
Why?

10:22.997 --> 10:28.663
After all these years, batsy,
you really need reasons from me?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.914
This has always been about us.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.246
Why do this to him?

10:33.341 --> 10:37.880
Because every time you and I play,
I lose.

10:37.971 --> 10:42.260
So I thought I'd try our game
on easy mode for once.

10:42.350 --> 10:48.596
And it was as easy
as beating a puppy to death

10:48.690 --> 10:50.772
with a kitten!

11:00.535 --> 11:02.491
Kal-El... Clark.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.529
Diana. I killed them.

11:05.623 --> 11:09.036
No! That madman orchestrated this.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.789
He's responsible. Only him.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.710
- Will you keep her safe?
- Of course.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.557
Superman, are you okay?

11:26.644 --> 11:27.679
Where is he?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.850
Where is the joker?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.803
Batman took him to arkham asylum.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.890
But I don't think you should
be anywhere near him.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.649
You've had an unfathomable loss.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.651
You need time to process it.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.287
Huh?

11:55.089 --> 11:58.172
Please don't do something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.840
I already have.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.343
Someone took everything
from you, didn't they?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.265
And look at what you became.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.016
The punching, kicking
embodiment of wrath.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.348
What do you think he'll become, hmm?

12:16.152 --> 12:20.441
A god who deluded himself
into believing he was just a man?

12:20.531 --> 12:23.273
What will Superman turn into?

12:23.368 --> 12:27.077
There are some things
even you can't corrupt, joker.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.495
Oh, batsy.

12:29.582 --> 12:34.451
You honestly think he'll
still be fun to play with?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.661
He'll grieve,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.293
but he will continue to be
the best man I know.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.749
Oh, no.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.131
This time, the joke's on you.

12:44.222 --> 12:48.886
And the world will burn.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.333
Now that's a punchline.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.006
And we're getting reports

13:42.030 --> 13:44.897
that Superman has broken
into arkham asylum

13:44.991 --> 13:46.401
and killed the joker.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.029
Finally, some good news.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.112
Screw you!

13:52.206 --> 13:53.309
Hey!

14:07.722 --> 14:11.214
My puddin' can light up a room

14:11.309 --> 14:15.393
with a happy giggle and grin

14:15.480 --> 14:19.393
my puddin' can light up a room

14:19.484 --> 14:22.772
burnin' the people within

14:22.862 --> 14:24.068
Harley Quinn!

14:26.824 --> 14:28.815
What? How'd you find me?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.992
You're not exactly
keeping a low profile.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.740
Oh! Think so?

14:38.169 --> 14:40.751
Get ready for a permanent low profile.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.332
Aww!

14:45.510 --> 14:47.125
I wanted the smashy mallet,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.926
not the squeaky one.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.504
Luckily, these ain't squeaky bullets.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.136
No freaking way!

14:58.231 --> 14:59.687
Do it again.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.895
Oh. Are you taking me
to get pulverized by Superman?

15:06.989 --> 15:07.989
No.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.939
So where are we goin'?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.194
To a secret location.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.321
Oh, won't be secret for long.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.779
Hey, how come your little beard
looks both ridiculous

15:15.873 --> 15:18.159
and cute, huh? Huh? Huh?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.453
Oh! What's this one do?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.877
You suck...

15:34.016 --> 15:36.553
A criminally
insane clown in Gotham city

15:36.644 --> 15:38.600
had some connection fo the disaster.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.504
How all of these so-called heroes...

15:41.566 --> 15:43.147
How can we feel protected

15:43.234 --> 15:45.145
with the threat of instant nuclear death

15:45.236 --> 15:47.147
hanging over every single one of us?

15:47.238 --> 15:48.899
Clark, how are you?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.150
Angry.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.401
That is your right.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.983
No. You're better than that.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.286
You have to be,
or the consequences could be fatal.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.284
Those are the consequences.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.240
Eleven million dead.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.496
Lois, my child.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.579
We're not executioners.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.500
How many times did you catch this joker?

16:10.595 --> 16:13.007
How many times did he escape
to kill again?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.554
- Do you even care?
- Ll care.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.848
But the law must be followed.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.551
Your laws are weak and ineffective,

16:20.646 --> 16:23.763
twisted by evil people
to escape just punishment.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.394
Or they simply don't apply at all.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.771
That cost thousands
of lives continued last night,

16:27.862 --> 16:29.853
despite a strongly-worded UN resolution.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.274
Diana's right.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.778
This can't go on.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.486
Don't.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.914
You'll throw away everything
the justice league stands for.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.367
Everything you stand for.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.043
I won't be held back by ideals

16:46.130 --> 16:47.357
that don't protect the innocent.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.496
You're grieving.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.127
No more, Bruce.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.218
No more.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.129
We were wrong.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.486
Mr. President, I'd like a word.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.744
You! You can't do this!

17:21.832 --> 17:23.413
Yes, I can.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.741
I've realized that now.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.916
You have no right. I'm their leader!

17:27.003 --> 17:28.243
Not anymore.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.580
And after destroying
biyala's military forces,

17:30.675 --> 17:33.257
Superman and wonder woman
deposited president Hussein

17:33.344 --> 17:34.925
at the hague for trial.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.843
Well, that happened.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.256
Hey, where am 17

17:40.351 --> 17:41.716
you're in the arrowcave.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.642
It's underground and lead-lined.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.748
You should be safe for now.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.888
Ah! It's nice to be drugged

17:46.983 --> 17:49.190
and wake up handcuffed in a lair.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.689
Puddin' and I used
to do this every Thursday.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.646
Ugh! File that under
"things I didn't wanna know."

17:54.740 --> 17:57.197
Arrowcave is a stupid name, though.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.616
How about we play the quiet game?

17:58.703 --> 18:01.319
Batman has the batcave,
that makes sense.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.699
Bats live in caves.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.825
Arrows don't.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.282
They're, whatchamacallit, inanimate.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.368
Okay. Quiet game. Lightning round.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.250
Oh! Why not call it the quiver?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.707
That's... that...

18:14.802 --> 18:16.258
That's actually much better.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.255
How did I not...

18:17.346 --> 18:19.257
Argh! This is so annoying.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.680
Eh, I've always been good
at naming things.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.632
Joker fish was all me.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.968
Stay put, Harley.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.223
Superman will turn you
into paste if he finds you.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.523
Got nowhere to go
now that Mr. J is gone.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.146
What will I do?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.443
Could you maybe chain me by the computer

18:34.530 --> 18:36.361
so I can update my resume?

18:39.368 --> 18:43.327
Ugh. Asshole...

18:45.916 --> 18:49.374
You all know me as Superman or Kal-El.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.704
But my earth name is Clark Kent.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.669
I am... was...

18:55.760 --> 18:57.546
A reporter for the daily planet.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.927
I spent my time there
writing about the evils of this world.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.842
I spent my time as a hero,

19:02.933 --> 19:04.844
reacting to many of those same evils.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.139
I failed you on both counts.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.436
What happened to Metropolis

19:09.523 --> 19:11.434
can never be allowed to occur again.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.731
He wouldn't.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.024
He is.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.772
I don't care about your lands,

19:15.863 --> 19:18.570
beliefs or petty squabbles.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.177
I don't care if you're a freedom fighter

19:20.201 --> 19:23.068
or a terrorist, dictator or president.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.995
Monsters will not be allowed
to roam free.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.572
- Finally.
- Quiet!

19:31.545 --> 19:32.545
Sorry.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.422
I am calling an immediate
worldwide ceasefire.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.465
All hostilities will stop...

19:39.303 --> 19:40.713
Or I will stop them.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.138
No one has the right
to take innocent lives.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.305
No one.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.678
It's over.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.476
Superman stopped a genocidal war

19:56.570 --> 19:59.403
the government of m'gota have been
waging against its people.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.489
In disputed kashmir,

20:02.576 --> 20:06.364
Superman and wonder woman destroyed
every piece of military equipment,

20:06.455 --> 20:08.320
declaring it an arms-free zone.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.664
You will agree to these terms

20:14.755 --> 20:16.711
or they will be agreed to for you.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.031
- Can everyone just sit down?
- It's a bad precedent.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.055
What about the law?

20:25.266 --> 20:26.631
Have you even considered this?

20:26.726 --> 20:27.636
Diana.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.015
The justice league cannot be
the world's police force.

20:31.105 --> 20:34.142
The week's events have
proven otherwise, Batman.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.225
Even now, Superman is saving lives

20:37.319 --> 20:38.684
while we talk.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.065
If we continue on this path,

20:41.157 --> 20:44.775
we go from policing
to occupying to jailing,

20:44.869 --> 20:46.700
then becoming tyrants.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.654
Or justice is finally done.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.114
Some won't like it,

20:51.208 --> 20:53.199
especially those that oppress the weak.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.455
But isn't that why we formed
the justice league?

20:55.546 --> 20:56.911
To stop those people?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.792
And you and Superman will decide

20:58.883 --> 21:00.373
which laws to enforce?

21:00.468 --> 21:03.881
One law... to do what's right.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.586
This is a time for action.

21:05.681 --> 21:10.050
With our help, Superman
can make a perfect world.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.429
So now he's god?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.432
The laws of Superman
will not be the laws of Atlantis.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.059
And certainly the Pentagon

21:16.150 --> 21:17.936
won't approve of a rogue Superman.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.642
Um... question.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.569
How will you punish people

21:21.655 --> 21:24.317
when they break whatever rules
Superman comes up with?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.648
I mean, I was a criminal.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.608
I needed second,
third and fourth chances

21:27.703 --> 21:29.113
before turning my life around.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.241
So, what's the deal there?

21:31.332 --> 21:33.664
Obviously, the punishment
would fit the crime.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.242
And you and Superman
decide these punishments?

21:36.337 --> 21:39.124
I believe my time
with the justice league is over.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.922
You can't be serious.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.369
I also have to step back.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.587
From what I've heard,

21:44.678 --> 21:47.465
most of the magical heroes
feel the same way.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.421
That brings me to the guardians.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.224
They've called John,
guy and myself back to oa.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.346
We understand.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.928
Everyone has to make
their own choice about this.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.311
At last, we agree on something.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.887
And that's when the boy scout
crashed our tea party.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.139
Afterwards, he swept the sky clean

22:36.230 --> 22:38.312
of every drone we had in the theater.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.141
Estimated casualties
if the strike were successful?

22:41.235 --> 22:43.396
Minimal, between ten and 30.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.399
Well, it seems he was protecting
the innocent like he said he would.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.196
What he was doing

22:48.284 --> 22:50.400
is fighting against the us military.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.405
That's called treason.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.828
Superman's bringing down governments.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.576
Fine when it's in our interest,

22:56.667 --> 22:59.409
a mighty big problem when it's not.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.619
What do you propose, Bob?

23:09.847 --> 23:11.383
On the floor, old man!

23:11.932 --> 23:12.932
Huh?

23:23.694 --> 23:26.106
Feisty, eh? Hold him.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.197
Light it up.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.666
Dad! Dad?

23:49.762 --> 23:51.252
Pa?

23:51.347 --> 23:52.803
He's not here.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.096
If you've hurt him...

23:55.184 --> 23:58.551
You'll what, put a fist
through my chest?

23:59.313 --> 24:01.053
Pretty dark for you.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.398
Where is he?

24:02.483 --> 24:03.768
Alive.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.191
Someplace not even you can find.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.393
He stays that way

24:07.488 --> 24:09.774
if you stop interfering
with governments.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.314
Sit in your fortress and do nothing.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.029
If an alien comes, you can punch it.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.738
Anything else,

24:18.832 --> 24:21.494
and we send dear old dad back to you

24:21.585 --> 24:22.870
in pieces.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.800
Maybe I'm wrong.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.472
Who am I to fight this fight?

24:38.185 --> 24:40.392
Maybe I'm not seeing clearly
because of...

24:41.188 --> 24:42.268
You know.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.263
You're a good man.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.475
And even through this loss,
you see what needs to be done.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.730
But how can I make good decisions

24:49.822 --> 24:53.610
when every single second
I feel like smashing something?

24:53.701 --> 24:57.034
If you believe in your path,
you cannot compromise.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.363
You'll have to be strong
as only you can.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.040
My father is the last link
to my humanity.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.368
If I lose him...

25:06.380 --> 25:08.291
Let your friends help you,

25:08.382 --> 25:10.748
as you've helped us time and again.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.297
Now, who is responsible?

25:30.154 --> 25:32.145
We're here for the mirror master.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.778
McCulloch. Time to talk.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.455
Personal space, your highness.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.500
Now, why don't you walk out of here

25:46.587 --> 25:48.953
and do it slow for me?

25:49.048 --> 25:49.958
Give up.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.289
There's no place to hide.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.383
Prove it.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.876
Huh?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.799
I wonder what happens
if I smash this mirror

26:00.893 --> 26:02.429
with you halfway out.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.475
You wouldn't. Would you?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.723
Do not test me.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.521
You have to understand, I had orders.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.816
The kind you can't say no to.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.393
Where's Jonathan Kent?

26:13.447 --> 26:16.530
Bolivia! Bolivia! Salar de uyuni.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.780
Take off your clothes.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.699
Uh, what now?

26:33.050 --> 26:34.631
Mirror master's belt.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.924
You'll need it to enter.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.423
He's guarded by a squad
of ex-special forces

26:38.514 --> 26:40.129
and a few powered villains.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.760
Thank you, Diana.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.010
Did he help?

26:45.729 --> 26:47.265
It's the perfect hiding place.

26:47.773 --> 26:51.140
Ten square kilometers
of endless reflected sky.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.017
But you'll find him.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.233
You're Superman.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.491
Sir, the plan has failed.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.658
- I'm sorry.
- Find me another card to play.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.294
That was incredibly stupid.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.172
You do not touch a man's parents.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.512
They said it couldn't be tracked to me.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.759
H-How did you know?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.307
- Will you tell him?
- No.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.929
But if he does work it out,
you're in danger.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.023
Ridiculous.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.268
He wouldn't touch me.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.317
- The public perception...
- Are you really that naive?

27:35.404 --> 27:36.814
There'd be no evidence.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.566
You'd just go missing.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.569
And no one will think to look
for your body on saturn.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.450
He wouldn't do that.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.696
He's Superman, right?

27:53.255 --> 27:54.255
Watch your feet.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.217
Argh!

28:02.514 --> 28:05.096
So, what'd you do wrong?

28:05.350 --> 28:07.386
- Legs.
- Legs.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.263
And you're trying
to hurt your opponents,

28:09.354 --> 28:11.766
which I'm trying not to take personally.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.395
Remember, some criminals are deserving
of a second chance,

28:15.485 --> 28:19.194
and second chances are harder to
take advantage of with a brain injury.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.860
I was taught by the league
of assassins and ra's al ghul.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.815
Yeah? How's that working out for you?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.786
Not very sporting, Damian.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.239
He gets pissy when he loses.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.334
I had him.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.875
- How are you?
- Is he here?

28:33.962 --> 28:36.294
Yeah, and broodier than usual.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.712
We'll give you some space.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.879
Come on, Damian.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.713
Superman, I'd like to say thanks.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.964
The joker deserved to die years ago.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.932
They took my father and you couldn't be
bothered to help?

28:53.023 --> 28:54.103
I was.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.227
And you have to stop what you're doing.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.318
Stop what?

28:57.653 --> 28:58.688
Saving lives?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.735
Bringing dictators to justice?

29:01.406 --> 29:02.816
You're scaring them.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.362
Good. They should be scared.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.985
Too scared to pull the trigger
or press the button.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.071
They should be too scared
to hurt each other.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.080
You taught me that.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.742
You killed a man, Clark.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.871
Not a man.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.038
A monster.
â€œWe can't decide who dies.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.292
One death.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.965
It always starts with one.

29:22.052 --> 29:25.419
I came here to make peace,
but you can't possibly understand

29:25.514 --> 29:26.634
what the joker took from me.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.385
I understand you're in pain.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.591
Look at you.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.268
Sitting in the dark,
ignoring dick and Damian.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.061
How many friends of theirs died?

29:35.148 --> 29:36.604
Have you consoled them?

29:37.693 --> 29:39.649
Your parents were murdered, Bruce.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.435
They couldn't be there for you.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.104
What's your excuse?

29:46.743 --> 29:47.823
Show me your hand.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.077
Come on, don't be you.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.367
Hairline fracture of the third finger.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.627
A little ligament damage.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.080
You'll be fine in three weeks.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.505
Good to know.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.049
I have an announcement planned
for tomorrow in Gotham.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.674
I'd like you to be there, at my side.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.175
I'm sorry, Clark.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.049
I can't do that.

30:20.444 --> 30:24.608
The republic of North Korea
is no longer a nuclear power.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.280
Their warheads have been confiscated.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.989
They are now welcome fo join
the world community in peace.

30:31.121 --> 30:34.363
That statement by wonder woman to the UN
came after her fierce fight

30:34.458 --> 30:38.292
with the dprk led to
several hundred casualties.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.914
Peace by punching.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.711
Never thought
I'd have a problem with it.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.835
Oh! Can we watch absolutely amish now?

30:44.926 --> 30:48.214
I'm dying to see if goody Anne
finishes her spice rack

30:48.305 --> 30:50.466
before rumspringa.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.798
How is no one calling Superman out?

30:53.226 --> 30:56.059
- How's Batman okay with this?
- I'm not.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.056
You're spying on me through my TV?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.937
- For how long?
- That's unimportant.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.028
Not to me.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.397
Hi, Batman.

31:05.489 --> 31:09.698
When you going to bring Superman
to justice for murdering my puddin'?

31:10.786 --> 31:12.492
Bring the arrows I gave you.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.864
Leave Harley.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.323
I don't regret killing the joker.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.123
I regret I had to kill him.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.871
But there are those who continue

31:20.962 --> 31:23.578
to defend psychopaths
like him even today.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.580
It's why I'm here in Gotham.

31:25.675 --> 31:30.465
The twisted individuals in arkham asylum
have hurt people again and again.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.889
The onus has always been
on getting them the help they need.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.091
They deserve nothing.

31:36.186 --> 31:40.099
Their illnesses are not an excuse
to threaten your safety.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.021
You were right. He's taking them.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.109
We're out of time.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.526
I've decided to move the worst criminals
to a secured facility.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.478
They won't threaten anyone again.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.653
Get in, Damian.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.449
As long as we're going to help Superman
burn arkham to the ground.

31:53.537 --> 31:54.993
You're 13.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.116
How are you the darkest thing
in this cave?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.539
Have you ever
considered for a single second

31:59.626 --> 32:01.287
that you might be wrong, father?

32:01.378 --> 32:03.118
Well, have you?

32:09.511 --> 32:11.047
You're self-righteous and arrogant,

32:11.138 --> 32:12.719
and you'll never, ever learn!

32:19.062 --> 32:20.723
You see his point, right?

32:21.565 --> 32:23.556
You were never a stubborn as him.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.732
Yeah, to be that stubborn

32:25.819 --> 32:28.060
a person has to be
directly related to you.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.521
You understand
why we can't let them do this?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.322
Of course. But don't be
so hard on the kid.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.651
After all, you had way longer
to indoctrinate me.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.905
Dick.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.157
I know, Bruce.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.455
Now let's go defend
a bunch of psychotic killers

32:40.542 --> 32:42.533
from the world's greatest heroes.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.842
Cyborg and wonder woman
are already in transit.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.466
- We'll be there in three minutes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.798
We're not done talking about
you bugging the arrowcave...

32:57.893 --> 32:59.758
Uh, the quiver.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.018
Yay! You used the name!

33:05.317 --> 33:07.103
- Whoa!
- Harley, what are you doing here?

33:07.194 --> 33:08.525
I locked you in the safe room.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.443
Eh... not my style.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.690
I'm coming with.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.944
To bring Superman to justice
or die trying.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.401
Either-or because I'm a hero now.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.612
Hero Harley!

33:19.706 --> 33:21.196
Just came up with that.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.326
Are you insane?

33:22.417 --> 33:26.626
Let me answer that question
with an action that reveals character.

33:26.713 --> 33:30.456
What? Oh, shit...

33:30.967 --> 33:32.673
Ahh!

33:33.512 --> 33:36.970
Here comes the boom! Ha-hal

33:41.728 --> 33:44.094
he's at a very important stage
in his treatment.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.431
I'm afraid we've lost confidence
in this facility, doctor.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.937
The inmates will be moved.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.734
And you get to decide that?

33:51.821 --> 33:52.821
No.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.195
You were right.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.368
They're exactly
where you said they'd be.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.696
Protecting the monsters.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.531
Robin, what are you doing?

34:04.626 --> 34:06.412
Bringing criminals to justice.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.083
I'm standing with Superman.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.706
Look who you're standing with,

34:09.797 --> 34:12.880
bane, killer croc, and whoever that is.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.550
I know you won't step aside,

34:15.637 --> 34:17.297
but you're not going to stop us.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.382
You don't belong here.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.304
Oh, yes, he does.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.135
Superman's got a scar now, don't you?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.344
Do you feel it?

34:25.438 --> 34:27.303
The release that comes with it.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.391
The freedom to do anything you want.

34:31.194 --> 34:35.233
Cyborg. Cell 83, Victor zsasz.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.367
Argh!

34:38.451 --> 34:39.657
Where are you you taking them?

34:39.744 --> 34:42.326
All you need to know
is that it's escape proof.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.992
Cell 86, mad hatter.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.492
Last chance, cyborg.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.498
Stop.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.329
All right, riddler, time to go.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.292
Argh!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.586
Okay, enough!

35:01.391 --> 35:02.426
Are you hurt?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.012
That's impossible.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.098
The data stamp on the virus.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.015
You uploaded it the day we met.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.100
Boy, that's low.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.562
Hey, Batman!

35:16.656 --> 35:20.695
I decided to be a hero
and help you stop Superman.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.867
We're gonna make a great team!

35:22.954 --> 35:24.785
Hero time!

35:30.837 --> 35:33.169
I recommend
putting aside our differences.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.256
For now.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.699
Argh!

36:29.229 --> 36:30.685
I had it under control.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.640
Yeah, everyone sees that.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.628
Hey, Robin doesn't punch people
after they go fetal.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.377
You're not Robin, so shut up!

37:11.271 --> 37:13.853
Nightwing. Grayson. Get up!

37:28.705 --> 37:30.787
Back to your cells. Now!

37:36.212 --> 37:38.578
Get up. Get up right now!

37:42.886 --> 37:45.298
He always blocks it. Always.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.675
Get away from him.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.691
I didn't mean to. I'm... i'm...

38:09.204 --> 38:11.286
I thought I could redeem you.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.617
I was wrong.

38:27.847 --> 38:28.847
What the hell?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.506
Since when does the man of steel
care about burglary?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.601
I'm here to talk.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.144
So talk.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.303
Nightwing is dead.

38:37.857 --> 38:38.857
Dick.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.359
Oh, no.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.017
He'll need someone.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.730
Where are you going?

38:44.197 --> 38:46.358
You're his best friend. Talk to him.

38:46.866 --> 38:47.866
I can't.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.441
Too much has happened.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.334
Bruce. Bruce.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.420
Bruce, stop!

39:11.432 --> 39:12.432
Stop!

39:16.563 --> 39:19.054
Stop. Just for today.

39:19.774 --> 39:20.934
Don't be Batman.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.309
Don't be the mask.

39:24.404 --> 39:25.439
It's okay.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.521
Let it out. Just for tonight.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.366
Let yourself fall apart.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.910
I promise to hold you together.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.056
Bummer. That little pissant.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.941
Welcome, dick Grayson.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.152
You're Saint Peter?

40:15.246 --> 40:18.659
Thought it'd be... less funky.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.833
This is not where you will rest.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.456
L, rama kushna,

40:24.547 --> 40:27.835
brought your soul here
to ask for your help.

40:27.926 --> 40:31.919
The world's existence
is balanced on a knife's edge.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.054
On one side, a future.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.178
On the other, a void.

40:38.269 --> 40:42.387
Your soul, so recently departed
from the mortal coil,

40:42.482 --> 40:44.347
may tip the scales.

40:44.984 --> 40:49.102
Though I fear, even this direct action
may not be enough.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.357
How can I help?

40:50.448 --> 40:54.441
First you must transform, dick Grayson.

41:05.546 --> 41:08.208
Your soul shall be infused
with my power.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.009
Your mind, with my knowledge.

41:13.429 --> 41:16.842
Once you were called nightwing.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.224
But now you shall be called...

41:21.396 --> 41:23.136
Deadwing.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.306
Well, it's not
the weirdest thing I've worn.

41:40.665 --> 41:41.665
Are you all right?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.874
What happened to Grayson was my fault.

41:45.962 --> 41:46.962
That's my burden.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.791
But we have more pressing issues.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.173
Damian...

41:50.258 --> 41:52.123
You saw how prepared father was.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.088
He has plans for all of us.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.676
You need allies.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.715
You're Damian's grandfather.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.050
Ra's al ghul.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.979
He tried to destroy Gotham, twice.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.272
Yes.

42:08.985 --> 42:12.227
I wanted to destroy Gotham
so I could renew it.

42:12.405 --> 42:15.772
It's cancerous and needs to be cleansed,

42:15.867 --> 42:17.448
much like arkham asylum.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.867
My actions and yours
have nothing in common.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.865
Respectfully, I disagree.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.447
But I have put aside my plans.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.540
Using your powers to the fullest,

42:26.627 --> 42:31.542
you can realize the perfect Gotham
we both wish for.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.374
I offer my loyalty and my support

42:34.469 --> 42:36.255
to your vision of the future.

42:36.763 --> 42:39.926
My grandfather
has never bowed to anyone.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.383
And I do not come empty-handed.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.639
One of my projects
that will help you immeasurably

42:49.734 --> 42:51.224
is nearly complete.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.396
It doesn't matter.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.945
I'd never ally myself
with a villain like you.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.363
Now, if you'll excuse me.

43:01.496 --> 43:03.578
How can we make him see
that he's vulnerable?

43:03.664 --> 43:04.949
How do we change his mind?

43:05.041 --> 43:05.951
We wait.

43:06.042 --> 43:10.126
Time and circumstance
will change Superman's mind for us,

43:10.213 --> 43:11.623
and I will be ready.

43:18.054 --> 43:20.295
- What's this?
- I'm trying to map the multiverse.

43:20.723 --> 43:23.180
There are infinite earths,
each with their own history

43:23.267 --> 43:25.178
based on choices
our other selves have made.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.884
I'm only concerned about one.

43:26.979 --> 43:31.518
Actually, while we designate
our earth, earth-1,

43:31.609 --> 43:35.022
it stands to reason
that our other selves would do the same.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.273
Interesting, don't you think?

43:37.740 --> 43:39.230
So what do you need?

43:39.325 --> 43:41.065
More of your t-spheres.

43:41.410 --> 43:42.650
May I ask why?

43:42.745 --> 43:43.985
I want to get rid of guns.

43:45.832 --> 43:47.823
For use around the world 24x7,

43:47.917 --> 43:50.499
you'd need to replicate
the t-spheres on a massive scale.

43:50.586 --> 43:54.579
Still, you could never
get rid of all the guns.

43:54.924 --> 43:57.461
But most. You know we could.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.464
Just because we can
doesn't mean we should.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.840
People would resent us.

44:02.223 --> 44:05.010
And they'd be alive to do that. Check.

44:05.101 --> 44:07.262
Some would fight.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.681
Let them come then, with sticks.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.768
Think of the lives we'd save. Check.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.100
Smoking.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.058
What?

44:16.154 --> 44:17.940
Cigarettes kill far more.

44:18.030 --> 44:21.067
People keep smoking even though
they know it's killing them.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.241
Their families can only watch them die.

44:23.703 --> 44:24.703
And?

44:24.787 --> 44:27.369
You want to save lives?
Jail every smoker.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.830
Check.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.200
And imprison anyone who speeds.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.377
Traffic fatalities are huge.

44:34.463 --> 44:35.703
Check.

44:36.883 --> 44:40.171
Lock up everyone who leaves
a dangerous dog unchained.

44:40.261 --> 44:41.296
Check.

44:41.804 --> 44:45.012
Finally, we kill anyone
who doesn't recycle.

44:45.766 --> 44:46.926
Checkmate.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.474
You're not going to help me, are you?

44:52.565 --> 44:55.307
No, sir, I am not.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.407
In here.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.575
Now what?

45:11.292 --> 45:12.702
Ah!

45:17.089 --> 45:19.705
How many lairs do you think Batman has?

45:19.800 --> 45:20.630
I don't know.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.175
Got to be running low
if we're using a toilet elevator.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.600
Hello, fellow do-gooders!

45:33.356 --> 45:34.562
I know, I know.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.605
But if Superman finds her,
he'll kill her.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.808
I understand your concern,

45:38.903 --> 45:41.485
but she cannot be
a part of this mission.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.159
Behave, Harley.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.285
Superman isn't thinking straight.

45:53.376 --> 45:54.957
He needs to be stopped.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.876
In the fortress of solitude
there's a red sun Cannon,

46:00.967 --> 46:03.959
built in case the phantom zone
Kryptonians ever escaped.

46:04.053 --> 46:07.011
Its ray can incapacitate even Superman.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.700
Can we back up
to where the thing that we need

46:08.724 --> 46:09.964
is in Superman's man cave?

46:10.059 --> 46:11.640
We'll have to break in.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.718
Hello, Christmas morning.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.769
You take me on the best dates.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.187
And if he's there?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.794
He's not going to help us
carry this thing out

46:18.818 --> 46:19.962
like we're his college roomies.

46:19.986 --> 46:23.478
If he's there,
we have a contingency plan.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.062
I can handle him.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.443
The Pentagon ran simulations
that prove it.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.321
Oh, and they're never wrong.

46:29.412 --> 46:32.074
Superman will be busy
with other matters.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.121
Wheels up in five.

46:36.002 --> 46:39.119
Cyborg and hawkman destroyed
Myanmar's military today.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.544
- Casualties?
- Minimal.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.122
Less than a hundred. The junta has fled.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.128
Those that stay deserve what they get.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.379
We're imposing peace.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.711
Yes, your will be done.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.262
Please don't say that.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.385
- I'm not a god.
- True.

46:52.476 --> 46:57.140
You aren't nearly as venal,
cruel, or arrogant.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.971
I just want to keep people safe.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.228
If anyone can, it's you.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.108
I'm sorry, Diana.

47:07.199 --> 47:09.281
You've been more than a friend.

47:09.368 --> 47:10.733
You've held me together.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.989
But... it's just too soon.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.365
Forgive me.

47:14.457 --> 47:15.572
Nothing to forgive.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.531
Let's get back to work.

47:28.054 --> 47:29.715
It seems your president

47:29.805 --> 47:32.342
is using the peace for his purposes.

47:41.817 --> 47:43.978
I don't want to waste time
turning those ships around

47:44.070 --> 47:45.560
when you can do it with a phone call.

47:45.654 --> 47:46.894
You can't just...

47:47.198 --> 47:49.940
Yes, I can.

47:55.164 --> 47:56.449
Argh!

47:57.083 --> 47:59.495
- Ugh.
- Why are you doing this?

47:59.585 --> 48:01.496
You must know I wouldn't let it stand.

48:04.173 --> 48:06.960
You did know. You're distracting me.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.682
You say "impenetrable fortress,"

48:20.773 --> 48:22.638
all I hear is "candy store."

48:32.660 --> 48:33.660
No.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.443
You should go, quickly.

48:36.539 --> 48:37.619
We're leaving.

48:37.706 --> 48:38.934
What about the fate of the world?

48:38.958 --> 48:40.539
Superman is not thinking clearly.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.742
If he thinks even for a moment,
that we're...

48:46.048 --> 48:49.211
You.

48:49.301 --> 48:51.337
Ugh!

48:53.264 --> 48:55.129
Calm down, son. I'm fine.

48:55.224 --> 48:56.805
You're all under arrest.

48:56.892 --> 48:58.382
I don't think so.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.552
- Argh!
- What are you doing? Stop!

49:01.647 --> 49:03.763
This needs to happen, Mr. Kent.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.088
The atom has entered your skull

49:08.112 --> 49:10.444
with a microscopic shard of kryptonite.

49:11.073 --> 49:14.361
He'll make sure
you don't do anything else.

49:16.245 --> 49:19.408
Huntress, arrow, load it up.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.743
Perhaps...

49:25.838 --> 49:27.499
I can be of assistance.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.351
Breathe.

49:50.446 --> 49:54.189
This is highly concentrated
chemotherapeutic gas.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.535
Radiation is harmless to you,

50:00.247 --> 50:03.489
but deadly to microscopic terrorists.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.611
Don't make me do this.

50:40.538 --> 50:42.403
Cl-Clark.

50:43.123 --> 50:44.238
Dad!

50:49.004 --> 50:50.004
No.

50:58.055 --> 50:59.920
Ollie. Run!

51:09.066 --> 51:10.476
Let them go.

51:10.568 --> 51:12.650
It was an accident.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.351
Try and forgive them.

51:15.531 --> 51:17.237
For me, please.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.528
I love you, son.

51:30.254 --> 51:31.460
You know in your heart

51:31.547 --> 51:33.754
they do not deserve forgiveness.

51:34.174 --> 51:37.337
Batman and his followers are relentless.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.464
They must be brought to justice.

51:39.555 --> 51:40.840
Allow me to help.

51:45.519 --> 51:46.955
I didn't want to do this,

51:46.979 --> 51:48.844
but my hand has been forced.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.648
From now on, any hero that doesn't
pledge loyalty to the justice league

51:52.735 --> 51:54.475
will be considered a fugitive.

51:54.570 --> 51:57.733
To aid with this,
surveillance drones will be deployed.

51:57.823 --> 52:01.031
First in america,
then the rest of the world.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.740
If you're the leader of a country,

52:06.332 --> 52:08.118
a criminal mastermind

52:08.208 --> 52:11.746
or even a petty crook,
this is your final warning.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.704
Stop committing violent acts.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.413
Or I will stop you.

52:23.057 --> 52:24.888
- Quiet, eh?
- Hmm.

52:25.309 --> 52:28.346
On the upside, no crime.
Like you always wanted.

52:28.437 --> 52:30.598
Now, the government is criminal.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.602
Superman has created a police state

52:33.692 --> 52:36.024
and allied himself with ra's al ghul.

52:36.862 --> 52:38.602
Not what I wanted.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.231
"Not what I wanted."

53:09.478 --> 53:11.309
You're gathering in his name?

53:12.564 --> 53:15.021
- Fascist!
- You had no right. Come on!

53:15.109 --> 53:17.441
- Joker was all about freedom.
- He's a fascist!

53:25.661 --> 53:26.992
Let me go.

53:27.705 --> 53:29.536
You can't help them by dying!

53:44.430 --> 53:46.967
Still can't believe
you're just telling me now.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.673
Green arrow was hurt
and you left him there?

53:49.768 --> 53:51.474
Maybe he was fine.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.894
He had a hole in his head.

53:54.273 --> 53:56.264
How'd you like a hole in your head?

53:56.900 --> 53:58.390
Try me.

53:58.485 --> 54:00.817
Sit down, both of you.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.237
Superman's modified t-spheres

54:12.332 --> 54:14.243
are making it impossible
for us to move.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.791
They need to be neutralized

54:16.879 --> 54:18.619
but the technology is beyond me.

54:18.714 --> 54:21.751
That's a first.
And your plan is?

54:21.842 --> 54:23.878
To free their inventor,
Mr. Terrific

54:23.969 --> 54:25.630
from Superman's prison.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.508
I've learned it's located
in the Mariana trench.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.635
The depth would crush my sub,

54:30.934 --> 54:33.596
and since they use cyborg
to boom tube in and out,

54:33.687 --> 54:34.597
there's no door.

54:34.688 --> 54:36.679
Like any girl, I like a challenge,

54:36.774 --> 54:38.355
but this sounds impossible.

54:38.984 --> 54:41.600
There's only one hero
not allied with Superman,

54:41.695 --> 54:43.526
who has the powers to get there.

54:43.614 --> 54:47.448
And where might he or she be, batsy?

54:47.534 --> 54:49.695
He's been hiding here for days.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.326
- Aw, you knew?
- Hm?

54:51.413 --> 54:52.778
Huh? Huh?

54:52.915 --> 54:55.281
And you didn't even offer me any jerky?

54:58.504 --> 54:59.334
Hey, ladies.

54:59.421 --> 55:02.629
Ugh. We're gonna lose so hard.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.839
I'm impressed
with your progress, Superman.

55:09.598 --> 55:11.463
His time is valuable, grandfather.

55:11.558 --> 55:12.843
Of course.

55:15.646 --> 55:18.308
I give you, am.A.Z.O.

55:19.608 --> 55:20.768
A robot?

55:20.859 --> 55:21.769
Much more.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.728
This is an indestructible
security and defense system

55:25.823 --> 55:27.438
that can learn and adapt.

55:27.533 --> 55:29.364
Your drones are useful.

55:29.785 --> 55:30.991
But what if...

55:31.078 --> 55:34.070
Something more robust is required?

55:34.498 --> 55:37.205
Imagine one of these
in every city and town,

55:37.292 --> 55:39.078
carrying out your orders.

55:42.089 --> 55:43.545
Test it in a small town.

55:45.467 --> 55:47.307
The drop zone is approaching.

55:48.262 --> 55:49.262
Ready?

55:49.304 --> 55:51.090
As I'll ever be.

56:15.497 --> 56:17.579
Stop right there!

56:17.833 --> 56:20.540
Your prison break ends now.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.208
The lock is impenetrable,

56:22.296 --> 56:24.082
and the guards don't have an access key.

56:24.172 --> 56:25.172
Uh-huh.

56:27.342 --> 56:28.582
Hey, look.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.376
I found the key.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.536
Bats wants you out of here.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.470
Great.

56:37.561 --> 56:38.641
Does he have a plan?

56:38.729 --> 56:41.220
He said... you had one.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.541
What's up, boys?
Anything good for lunch today?

57:14.848 --> 57:16.133
We need to break the glass.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.134
I thought you were like,

57:17.225 --> 57:18.681
the third smartest man in the world.

57:19.144 --> 57:21.601
It's keeping the water out.

57:21.730 --> 57:23.595
I can't get out the way you got in.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.227
We need to crack the dome
to have any chance.

57:28.862 --> 57:30.352
Surrender now!

57:30.739 --> 57:32.024
Hope you know what you're doing.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.364
Don't move. Or I'll...

57:42.960 --> 57:43.995
That was unexpected.

57:47.381 --> 57:48.381
Dick?

57:53.053 --> 57:54.668
Ideas, thoughts?

57:56.431 --> 57:59.764
Look, I'm flattered, but very married.

58:00.310 --> 58:01.550
Nice tattoo, though.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.351
It's not a tattoo.

58:09.861 --> 58:12.147
Hey, this thing looks really thin.

58:12.239 --> 58:14.092
- Is it strong enough?
- Probably.

58:14.116 --> 58:15.116
Probably?

58:25.877 --> 58:26.707
You should be proud.

58:26.795 --> 58:28.231
I've done questionable things

58:28.255 --> 58:29.335
to accomplish this.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.421
Was it a surprise that

58:31.508 --> 58:33.499
entrenched elites and special interests

58:33.593 --> 58:35.254
would not willingly give up power?

58:35.887 --> 58:37.627
They should have listened to reason.

58:37.723 --> 58:41.011
Instead, they fought and you won.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.513
And now, the world is at peace.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.265
Batman will be found.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.187
His resources have been strangled.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.266
His allies are few. What can he do?

58:59.619 --> 59:01.280
This is playing around the world.

59:01.413 --> 59:02.744
I can't find the source.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.243
The source is Bruce,
trying to sway people.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.949
It won't work, not for joker acolytes.

59:11.923 --> 59:15.336
You... you killed these children

59:15.635 --> 59:17.171
because they angered you?

59:17.262 --> 59:18.877
No, I killed them

59:18.972 --> 59:20.678
because a lesson had to be learned.

59:20.766 --> 59:22.051
I have to be strong,

59:22.601 --> 59:23.716
like you said.

59:31.526 --> 59:32.712
As far as I can tell,

59:32.736 --> 59:34.442
my reprogramming of Superman's drones

59:34.529 --> 59:35.689
1s still undetected.

59:36.198 --> 59:38.530
To be safe, we'll move soon.

59:38.617 --> 59:40.949
To where? Someplace worse?

59:41.036 --> 59:42.367
She's got a point.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.695
This is the bottom of
the hideout barrel,

59:44.790 --> 59:47.873
as I am literally sitting on a barrel.

59:47.959 --> 59:49.119
I do have some good news

59:49.211 --> 59:50.826
on the other project you set me on.

59:50.921 --> 59:53.833
It was tough adapting
Kryptonian tech to our needs.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.461
I just have to finish assembly
and run some tests.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.291
How long? â€œA week.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.643
Run!

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.586
Ra's, take the robot offline now.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:25.591
It's malfunctioning.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.173
I respectfully disagree, Superman.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.850
A.m.a.z.0. Is functioning perfectly.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.097
It is you...

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.515
Who are not.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.142
I told you,

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.939
it learns and adapts.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.767
What I neglected to tell you is that

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.480
it can also duplicate your abilities.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:45.659
Like you...

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:48.989
A.m.a.z qo. Knows that whether one death,

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.285
or a million are required
to achieve perfection,

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:55.708
then these deaths must occur.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.667
Argh!

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.934
Time to get experimental.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:56.723
Booyah!

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.856
No matter what, we put that thing down.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:43.569
Hal!

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.134
The justice league comms are going wild.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.068
What's happening?

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.365
What must.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:58.118
Argh!

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.700
We'll keep the thing occupied.
Assemble the device.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:42.705
What are you, nuts?

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.458
Look, you're a freaking guy in a suit.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:46.924
Let me help.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.465
Everyone needs to follow the plan.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.803
Hero Harley!

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.681
Come on, let's move!

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.262
Hey, plas,

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:00.093
thanks for carrying all the heavy shit.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.143
Father?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.520
Do not let yourself become infected

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.602
with his weakness again.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.023
He's my father.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.903
You... disappoint me.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.907
I guess that's just
the way it is with family.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.498
This would be easier to put together,

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.058
let me see,

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.181
anywhere but a freakin' battle.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.516
Not my first choice either.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.268
Synchronizing chain emitters.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:51.694
Powering to phase.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:55.576
Back in a tick.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.578
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.221
Apparently, I have no worthy heirs.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.226
Prepare to die, boy.

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.380
Let me help you, little bro.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.360
You... is it really you?

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:34.858
In the spiritual flesh.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.358
I'm so, so sorry.
I was stupid. I should have...

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.306
How about we kick
your evil grandfather's ass,

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.640
and stop him from taking over the world

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.746
before we have any
heartfelt conversations?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Agreed.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:48.580
It's okay.
You've got this, plas.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.911
You've got this, boy.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.754
It's just like building blocks.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.465
Scary building blocks.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.890
Yes!

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:07.637
Oh, no.

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:31.922
Screw this.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:40.048
Guys, do something... ow!

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.674
Before it learns to control
my powers.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.171
Hyah!

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.816
You are not going
for the killing blow.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.779
Your father made you weak.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.698
Careful, Damian.
He's drawing you in.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.325
Stop fighting me.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.527
I can finish him.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.158
We need to work together.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.201
I will have control!

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:57.417
I only needed you
to get me close to Superman.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.419
Your use to me is at an end.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.667
There's only one way to stop him.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.799
No. Sit back and let me do this.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.673
Watch his feet. Wait for it.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.938
Well, he'll have one hell of
a headache in the morning.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.769
How is this possible?

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.606
I guess you can see me
because I controlled your body.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.694
In regards to how I'm here,

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:25.901
that gets weird.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.077
I have to say, I...

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.075
You're better than I am.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.206
And you always were.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:34.791
Can you forgive me?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.118
Already have.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.795
I've gotta go now.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.622
Watch your feet, and remember,

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.673
you don't have to kill
everyone you fight.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.341
- Please?
- Hm.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680
Fine.

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.429
I'll try it your way.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.597
Well, that sucked.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.977
The battle is won.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.693
But at what cost?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:03.771
At least they died heroes.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.778
Unlike you terrorists,
who will go to jail for your crimes.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.655
What?

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.031
They saved our lives.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.412
Though they had everything to lose,

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.660
they helped us.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.076
Are you turning on me, Diana?

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.410
I had hoped

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:21.043
killing the joker children
was a momentary madness.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.207
I see now that it's not.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:25.668
And I see, I'm the only one I can trust.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.628
Do you hear yourself, Clark?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.306
Stand down.

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:33.764
Make the decision
to finally stop this madness.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.824
Earth-9 Superman,

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.535
welcome to earth-1.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.158
Actually, we're earth-1.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.576
What are we?

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:55.531
Twenty-two.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:56.832
Oh!

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.250
Okay.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.793
You don't belong here.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.172
Regardless, your Mr. Terrific
told me what happened here.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.420
I'm deeply sorry for your losses,

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.047
but you're on the wrong side of this.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.424
No one is talking me out of this.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.550
Not even you.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:13.011
Yeah, we can be stubborn sometimes.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.975
Luckily, I'm here to convince you.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.599
Well, then convince away.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.474
Please stop.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:46.267
You're tired and injured.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.321
Not as injured as you're about to be.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.202
You see...

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:55.568
I know your secret.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.163
You're holding back.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:02.867
You always held back.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:04.462
We both used to.

01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:06.795
But now I don't.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.290
Not anymore.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.775
This was your big trump card, Bruce?

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:32.782
You think I'll stop

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.448
because someone will talk me out of it?

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:35.869
Yes.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:37.495
Hello, Clark.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:55.805
You're...

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:57.714
You're not Lois.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.762
And you're not my Clark.

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.641
He died stopping brainiac.

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.184
Every life was sacred to him.

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:12.862
Is it not to you?

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.072
I'm trying to give the world peace.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.738
By murdering others
that disagree with you?

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.372
How many people,

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:28.411
husbands, wives and children
will you kill for peace, Clark?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.295
How did it come to this?

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.805
What have I done?

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.846
I deserve death.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.428
No.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.936
You don't get off that easy.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.522
Mr. Terrific and I will
build a red sun prison.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:55.946
From there, you'll be let out
when we need you.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:57.906
That won't be necessary.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.033
I'll stay wherever you put me.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.384
So what happens now?

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:26.514
I don't know.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.060
But maybe we've all
earned a second chance.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.605
What's gotten into you?
