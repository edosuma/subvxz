WEBVTT

00:05.621 --> 00:06.932
Fantastic sex.

00:08.213 --> 00:11.949
With someone I actually like.
A bit.

00:14.167 --> 00:16.526
Quite a bit.
I think.

00:27.006 --> 00:29.518
When did sex become so complicated?

00:35.238 --> 00:40.711
Shit! First client in 6 days, 
I cannot be late for this.

01:22.393 --> 01:24.353
Alex!
Mm!

01:24.353 --> 01:26.433
What?

01:26.433 --> 01:28.833
I have to leave.
What's the panic?

01:28.833 --> 01:30.873
I've erm, I've got a meeting.

01:30.873 --> 01:34.113
On a Saturday?
Yeah, I'm meeting...

01:34.113 --> 01:35.993
a friend.

01:35.993 --> 01:37.993
Jemima from school...for lunch.

01:37.993 --> 01:40.833
I'll come.
Er, no, no.

01:40.833 --> 01:44.273
You can't come without a warning.
That's just not very polite.

01:44.273 --> 01:47.753
Well, text her and warn her.
She's a bit... She's a bit weird.

01:47.753 --> 01:50.953
She's not very nice...to men.

01:50.953 --> 01:53.033
She's a horrible...

01:53.033 --> 01:56.433
horrible, horrible woman and you
do not wanna have lunch with her.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.553
OK.
OK.

02:01.753 --> 02:03.713
# FEIST: My Moon My Man

02:06.673 --> 02:08.833
'Not one of my usual hotels.

02:10.872 --> 02:13.073
But then this isn't
a usual kind of job.

02:13.073 --> 02:16.473
This one's been set up
by my new best friend.'

02:18.833 --> 02:21.313
Bambi's idea of a favour.

02:21.313 --> 02:24.073
A threesome with, wait for it,

02:24.073 --> 02:26.553
a distinguished nightclub owner.

02:48.673 --> 02:51.913
Bambi is a complete liability but...

02:51.913 --> 02:53.873
needs must.

02:57.073 --> 02:59.033
Belle.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.753
What's wrong?

03:01.753 --> 03:04.593
You're gonna kill me, babes.

03:04.593 --> 03:06.593
What happened?

03:09.633 --> 03:11.953
I've got a little friend
come to stay.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.113
Who?
Aunty Flo.

03:17.273 --> 03:19.313
Bambi, have you taken something?

03:19.313 --> 03:21.393
What? No. I...

03:21.393 --> 03:23.433
I've got the painters in.

03:23.433 --> 03:26.233
Oh, you're taking the -
I know. Please don't shout at me.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.273
My head's banging.
I'm not shouting.

03:28.273 --> 03:31.553
How can you not know when
your period's due? Page one, Bambi.

03:31.553 --> 03:33.433
I dunno. I just...forgot.

03:33.433 --> 03:36.593
I lost my diary. This month's
flown by. I've been up the wall.

03:36.593 --> 03:39.793
Look, we can call Stephanie.
Get one of the other girls in.

03:39.793 --> 03:43.353
He's here in five minutes.
Well, I'll just say my nan's died

03:43.353 --> 03:45.873
and it's just you.
We can give him a discount.

03:45.873 --> 03:48.913
No! Absolutely no way!
It's completely unprofessional!

03:48.913 --> 03:50.873
Well, what am I supposed to do?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.473
What's this?
That's sponge.

04:12.473 --> 04:14.593
And what am I supposed to do
with it?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.473
Not on your life, babe.

04:19.473 --> 04:21.433
OK.

04:22.593 --> 04:24.673
Belle, wait.

04:24.673 --> 04:27.353
What if it's still got Jif on it?
Straight out the packet.

04:27.353 --> 04:29.553
Are you sure it's gonna work?
Yeah.

04:29.553 --> 04:31.953
If it's up high enough,
it should be fine. Ugh.

04:32.513 --> 04:34.473
Fine.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.313
(KNOCKING)

04:38.313 --> 04:40.273
# THE KINKS: I Gotta Move

04:49.513 --> 04:51.593
Beautiful.

04:51.593 --> 04:53.473
Close, Belle.

04:53.473 --> 04:56.833
Ha, ha. Girl with a quick wit!
Love it, love it, love it.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.833
Martin.
Delighted to meet you, Belle.

05:01.793 --> 05:05.313
So, captivating as you are, Belle,

05:05.313 --> 05:07.673
I trust this isn't a party
just for two.

05:08.953 --> 05:11.913
Ah.
Hi, there. I'm Bambi.

05:11.913 --> 05:14.553
Wham-bam, Bambi!

05:14.553 --> 05:16.793
Mwah.

05:16.793 --> 05:18.993
So, can I get you anything, Martin?

05:18.993 --> 05:22.033
I think I've got everything I need,
thank you very much.

05:28.193 --> 05:30.273
Oh, yeah.

05:30.273 --> 05:32.313
# DONNA SUMMER:
Love To Love You, Baby

05:32.553 --> 05:34.513
Mm.

05:41.753 --> 05:44.313
Oh, my God. Is that what I look like?

05:44.313 --> 05:46.673
I mean, she looks ridiculous.

05:47.793 --> 05:50.393
Not her fault.
She's just doing her job.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.633
If that's what the client wants,

05:52.633 --> 05:54.833
that's what the client gets.

05:55.513 --> 05:57.953
Come on, Belle. Get involved.

05:57.953 --> 05:59.993
Mm.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.873
(BOTH MOAN)

06:07.073 --> 06:09.113
Hey!

06:09.113 --> 06:11.393
What about that, then?

06:14.793 --> 06:16.833
Here we go!
Ooh!

06:20.273 --> 06:23.273
Ooh. Love it, don't you?

06:23.273 --> 06:25.353
Tell me you love it, girls.

06:25.353 --> 06:27.393
Oh, I love it.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

06:29.073 --> 06:31.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:31.113 --> 06:33.153
Belle, what's going on?

06:33.153 --> 06:35.113
(Come on. Get a grip.)

06:37.433 --> 06:39.713
Sorry about that.
Everything OK?

06:39.713 --> 06:41.873
Yeah, just had
a bit of a dizzy spell.

06:41.873 --> 06:46.073
Ah. Don't worry. I tend to have
that effect on women, Belle, eh?

06:49.433 --> 06:51.593
No. Actually, no. I can't do it.

06:53.353 --> 06:56.433
Put your head between your legs.
Have a glass of water.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.913
I'm not dizzy. I'm just
not gonna have sex with you.

06:58.913 --> 07:01.953
You're a prostitute, for God's sake!
She's new.

07:01.953 --> 07:04.713
Fine. I'll do everything
but have sex.

07:04.713 --> 07:06.513
So will my wife.
That's why I'm here.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.633
It's not gonna happen!

07:13.953 --> 07:15.953
It's not funny, Ben.
Come off it.

07:15.953 --> 07:18.033
He was wearing
a leopard print thong.

07:18.033 --> 07:21.473
It's completely understandable.
It wasn't because of his pants.

07:21.473 --> 07:23.873
Come on.
You were just having a weird one.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.953
Take a couple of days. Chill out.

07:25.953 --> 07:28.593
I've been off all week.
What are you talking about?

07:28.593 --> 07:32.273
You haven't had one night off.
I've been trying to get hold of you.

07:32.273 --> 07:34.673
I met someone.
What do you mean?

07:34.673 --> 07:36.633
A man.

07:36.633 --> 07:39.593
His name's Alex.
What, you haven't been working?

07:40.313 --> 07:43.673
No. I'm...I'm sorry. I...

07:43.673 --> 07:46.713
I really wanted to tell you.
It's just happened so quickly.

07:46.713 --> 07:49.753
I haven't had time to think about it.
What's happened so quickly?

07:49.753 --> 07:51.793
Me and him.
You and him?

07:51.793 --> 07:54.433
Ben, do you wanna stop
repeating everything I say?

07:54.433 --> 07:58.313
Sorry. Sorry, since the last time
I saw you,

07:58.313 --> 08:01.233
you've met someone
who's become a "you and him".

08:01.233 --> 08:03.793
I met someone and it's fun.

08:03.793 --> 08:07.113
We're having fun and I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about it before.

08:07.113 --> 08:10.273
You know what it's like. When you
met Vanessa - When I met Vanessa,

08:10.273 --> 08:13.833
I told you the next day. It took
you a month to tell me you proposed.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.513
Didn't lie to your face.
Oh, Ben. Come on.

08:16.513 --> 08:19.113
I'm sorry.
I'm telling you now, aren't I?

08:19.113 --> 08:21.713
So, it's a week later. Shoot me!

08:29.073 --> 08:31.113
What does he do?

08:31.113 --> 08:33.073
He's a doctor.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.113
What does he think of your job?

08:38.113 --> 08:41.033
Surprise, surprise, Ben,
I haven't told him.

08:41.033 --> 08:44.393
Anyway, I might not have a job
if I carry on like I did today.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.513
Was it because of him?

08:46.513 --> 08:48.753
What?
Could you not go through with it

08:48.753 --> 08:52.073
because of him, because of Alex?
I dunno.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.513
Every time I shut my eyes I...

08:54.513 --> 08:57.113
just...kept picturing him

08:57.113 --> 08:59.433
and the whole thing
just felt a bit wrong.

09:00.353 --> 09:02.593
It's more than a bit of fun, then,
isn't it?

09:02.593 --> 09:04.673
I've known him five minutes.

09:04.673 --> 09:06.873
But...
What but?

09:06.873 --> 09:09.233
There is no but. He's nice.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.513
We're having fun. It's no big deal.

09:12.993 --> 09:14.953
Today was...an aberration.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.113
Probably was the thong.

09:18.113 --> 09:21.113
Wouldn't have happened
with one of my regulars. Right.

09:22.873 --> 09:24.713
Bit of support, please, Ben.

09:26.313 --> 09:28.873
He's nice. You'd like him.

09:30.793 --> 09:32.953
I'm sure I would.

09:32.953 --> 09:35.673
In fact, he wants to meet you.
Why?

09:35.673 --> 09:38.113
Because I talk about you
all the time.

09:39.193 --> 09:41.113
Right.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.153
I was thinking about lunch this week.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.233
All right. Brilliant.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.873
Really?
Yeah. Sure.

09:46.873 --> 09:49.753
You come clean to him and I'll come
and have lunch with you.

09:49.753 --> 09:51.913
Yeah, that's a really good idea (!)

09:52.793 --> 09:56.913
"Hi, Alex. Ben's really looking
forward to meeting you.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.313
Quick heads-up, though,
before we sit down to eat,

09:59.313 --> 10:02.113
I'm a prostitute.
Mm. The lamb looks nice."

10:02.113 --> 10:04.193
Sort it out, Ben!

10:04.193 --> 10:07.993
You can't keep it from him.
That's completely out of order.

10:07.993 --> 10:10.753
And it's out of order
to use me as some sort of decoy.

10:10.753 --> 10:13.753
A decoy. For God's sake,
Ben, for once...

10:13.753 --> 10:17.593
I'm engaging in the fairly normal
activity of seeing someone.

10:17.593 --> 10:19.673
And I'd like you to meet him.

10:19.673 --> 10:23.433
I'm not getting married.
I'm not trying to shaft anyone.

10:23.433 --> 10:26.913
It's not serious. I haven't
got some big ultimatum on my hands.

10:26.913 --> 10:30.713
I'm just trying to live a life,
which you are a big part of.

10:30.713 --> 10:34.353
It's just lunch. It's no big deal.
So you keep saying.

10:34.353 --> 10:37.033
Do you know what?
Don't worry about it. Don't come.

10:37.033 --> 10:40.593
Where are you going?
To rub myself with a big stick.

10:40.593 --> 10:42.513
I can't do Thursday.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.380
You'll really like Ben.
He's brilliant.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.460
I hate him already.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.780
Is he better-looking than me?
Is that actually possible?

11:08.780 --> 11:10.860
I suppose not, no.

11:10.860 --> 11:13.260
Yeah. I'm gonna like him.
I can't wait to meet him.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.540
Thanks for tonight.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.580
I had a really lovely time.
Whoa.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.540
I'm worried that sounds like
the sentence,

11:20.540 --> 11:24.020
"I've got a headache and I wanna go
home early," is gonna follow.

11:24.020 --> 11:26.260
Not at all. I just wanted to say it.

11:26.260 --> 11:28.820
Anyway, you know what the best cure
for a headache is?

11:28.820 --> 11:30.860
Two Nurofen and an early night.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.820
No. Sex.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.780
Shall we go back to yours?

11:36.780 --> 11:39.220
Er, isn't your place nearer?

11:40.340 --> 11:42.220
I don't think so.
I think it is.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.140
OK. Yeah. We can go back to mine

11:46.140 --> 11:50.060
but you've gotta be quiet cos I've
got this neighbour from hell and -

11:50.060 --> 11:52.060
Why don't you want me
to see your flat?

11:52.060 --> 11:55.020
Now you're being silly.
Or meet your friends, or...

11:55.020 --> 11:57.220
You're having lunch
with Ben tomorrow.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.340
You're meeting my best friend.
Oh, OK.

11:59.340 --> 12:02.180
I didn't realise it was a trade-off.
"You're meeting Ben,

12:02.180 --> 12:05.580
so that's another couple of weeks
you're not allowed to see my flat."

12:05.580 --> 12:07.660
Oh.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.220
(SIGHS)
You're making me feel like some...

12:10.220 --> 12:13.380
clingy twat. And I'm not.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.820
I'm just suggesting
we go back to your place.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.860
That's all.
All right.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.900
We'll go back to mine.
It's no big deal.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.460
Good.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.220
Do you wanna run up ahead and lock
your husband in the cupboard?

12:33.220 --> 12:36.140
No. Looks like he's still out.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.580
Whoa! What is that?

12:38.580 --> 12:40.660
It's my friend.

12:40.660 --> 12:44.740
Girl, so sorry it's la-
Babes, didn't realise you were wor-

12:44.740 --> 12:47.700
What are you doing here?
I just felt a bit bad about yester-

12:47.700 --> 12:49.780
Erm, Alex. This is Bambi.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.700
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.700
It's one thirty in the morning.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.260
I know but I thought
you might still be up

12:57.260 --> 12:59.340
and...look, you are.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.780
Yeah and we're just going in.
I could head off.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.460
No, no.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.300
I don't wanna gatecrash.
It was just on the off-chance.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.700
It's fine.
I'll see you at lunch tomorrow. OK?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.660
OK.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.260
(Drinking problem.)

13:17.020 --> 13:19.020
What do you want, Bambi?

13:23.020 --> 13:26.460
What's that? Your share
of the money from yesterday.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.620
I felt like a shitbag not
splitting it. I didn't do anything.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.860
You did me a favour.
Turned up at the last minute.

13:31.860 --> 13:35.860
Plus, you helped me out with the
whole...sponge thing. Gross out!

13:35.860 --> 13:38.660
I said I didn't want it. It's fine.
You gotta take it.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.300
I'm really sorry
he turned out to be such a dick

13:41.300 --> 13:44.660
after me talking him up like that.
Sounded very nice on the phone.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.380
"Love it, love it, love it."

13:47.540 --> 13:49.460
Go on. Please.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.980
All right. Thanks.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.620
Would it be all right
if I hang out here? Just for a bit?

13:54.620 --> 13:56.660
Er...

13:58.620 --> 14:01.300
So, that's the boyfriend, then.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.340
Yep.
He seems nice.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.660
Yeah, he is.
Fit as a butcher's dog.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.460
You told him what you do?
No, course not.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.860
Not sure how much longer
I can keep that going for, though.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.780
Well, it depends, doesn't it,

14:15.780 --> 14:18.340
how serious you are.
If it's just a fling...

14:18.340 --> 14:21.420
He wants to meet my mates.
I could come out with you both.

14:21.420 --> 14:25.100
He's already met me. We could do
something fun like go bowling.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.820
(GIGGLES) Thanks, but...no thanks.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.660
Er, I don't think...
bowling's his thing.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.380
Plus, we're having lunch
with my mate Ben tomorrow.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.620
Well, I could maybe come to that
with you.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.500
What's Ben like?
Engaged.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.620
I didn't mean it like that.
I was just...

14:41.620 --> 14:43.980
thinking it could be a laugh.
Yeah.

14:43.980 --> 14:46.220
Might be a lot of things.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.660
A laugh, not top of the pile.

14:48.660 --> 14:50.660
You really need to loosen up, babes.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.860
So, who do you support, then?

15:09.860 --> 15:13.740
Oh, I'm a rugby man...actually.
Yeah.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.220
Are you into that at all?
Sorry?

15:18.220 --> 15:20.620
Rugby?
Er...

15:20.620 --> 15:23.020
Right. No, I'm not.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.380
Right.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.340
So, you're a doctor?

15:30.340 --> 15:32.380
Yeah, yeah.
It's a great job.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.300
You enjoy it?
Yeah.

15:40.260 --> 15:42.260
Ah, there she is.
Sorry.

15:42.260 --> 15:44.380
Sorry I'm late.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.460
It's all right.
We were having a lovely chat.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.500
You didn't tell me
Alex was into rugby.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.540
No. Should I have done?

15:52.540 --> 15:54.740
No.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.780
Ben's a footie bloke.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.740
Bit little for rugby, aren't you?

15:59.740 --> 16:01.980
I er, know it's only lunch
but I thought...

16:01.980 --> 16:03.660
day off, why not?
Yeah.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.700
I'm gonna get a beer, actually.
Good girl.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.780
Try it. It's really nice.

16:07.780 --> 16:10.180
I thought wine
brought you out in a rash.

16:12.540 --> 16:16.100
Only certain types. There's a doctor
handy if anything should...kick up.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.900
Yeah, I'm here to help.

16:22.220 --> 16:25.660
Alex has just been er, sharing
his theory about you and me.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.860
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah. He erm...

16:27.860 --> 16:29.940
reckons you're living a double life.

16:29.940 --> 16:32.380
Does he now?

16:32.380 --> 16:35.540
I was just er, having a laugh
with Ben before you got here.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.020
And I think it's time
you came clean, huh?

16:38.020 --> 16:41.180
How many of those did you manage
to cram in before I got here?

16:41.180 --> 16:42.980
Oh, yeah, that's right.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.100
Alex, I'm a big girl's blouse
and can't take my drink.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.580
You...you look healthy enough to me.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.460
Thank you.
So, Hannah, as I was saying,

16:51.460 --> 16:53.660
are you gonna tell Alex the truth
or shall I?

16:53.660 --> 16:55.380
What are you on about?

16:55.380 --> 16:57.220
Right, then, I will.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.580
Alex...the lovely Hannah here...

16:59.580 --> 17:02.260
is...in fact...a...

17:02.260 --> 17:03.820
Ben.
..spy...

17:03.820 --> 17:05.940
who works for the MI5.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.180
That was absolutely hilarious.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.540
(PHONE RINGS)

17:10.540 --> 17:13.339
I'm so sorry, I have to get this.
it's work. Back in a sec.

17:15.220 --> 17:18.140
Why are you being like this?
Are you kidding? Like what?

17:18.140 --> 17:20.579
Ben's allergic to everything,
shit at rugby.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.900
He can't take his drink.
I always take the piss.

17:22.900 --> 17:25.619
Not in front of people.
I'm just trying to be normal.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.859
What are you trying to be?
How about polite?

17:27.859 --> 17:30.620
Look after me, Han. For fuck's sake.
Look after you?

17:30.620 --> 17:33.060
The "Hannah's leading a double life"
bollocks.

17:33.060 --> 17:36.300
Is that looking after me?
Whatever's going on, deal with it.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.540
Stop being like this.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.540
Everything all right?
Yeah. Fine, thanks.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.220
Ben thinks I'm being a twat.

17:47.220 --> 17:50.660
Hannah! Well, can't just pretend
that everything's hunky-dory.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.020
I'm sure you can.
Should I go to the loo?

17:53.020 --> 17:54.980
No, Alex. You're fine.

17:54.980 --> 17:58.620
I'm really sorry, Ben. It's fine.
Let's just forget about it.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.900
It's just we're so close, I thought
we could say anything to each other.

18:01.900 --> 18:05.620
Let's just drop it. You can't bring
that up and not wanna talk about it.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.860
You're making Alex
feel uncomfortable.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.500
Oh, well, I'm on a roll today, then,
aren't I?

18:10.500 --> 18:13.340
It's fine.
You're not making me feel unc...

18:13.340 --> 18:15.460
Shall we order?
Yep.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.140
Is it really crappy
if I have burger and chips?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.700
No, that's fine.
I'm gonna get...the...

18:21.700 --> 18:23.780
risotto.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.140
What about you, Ben?
Beef Wellington.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.180
I'll go order.
Thanks, Alex.

18:34.300 --> 18:38.180
Thanks a million, Ben (!) You're
making this really fucking awkward.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.900
Problem solved.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.180
Where did Ben go?

18:52.220 --> 18:54.300
I'm sorry, Alex, I...

18:54.300 --> 18:57.380
I think he's having some girlfriend
problems, or something.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.180
Hannah...is there something
you're not telling me?

19:01.540 --> 19:03.540
No.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.500
Pretty easy to work out.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.020
What are you on about?
Ben's in love with you, isn't he?

19:11.020 --> 19:13.220
W... No!

19:13.220 --> 19:15.980
(LAUGHS) No, Ben's like my brother.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.860
I don't think he sees it like that.
No.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.860
You've got the wrong end
of the stick. I don't think so.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.180
It's nothing to do with me.
I've overstepped the mark as it is.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.020
So...

19:26.020 --> 19:27.980
W... How do you mean?
I just...

19:31.060 --> 19:34.540
I know what I said
about playing it cool and...

19:34.540 --> 19:36.540
having fun and all that stuff but...

19:43.900 --> 19:45.980
The truth is...

19:45.980 --> 19:47.980
Hannah...

19:47.980 --> 19:50.060
the more time I spend with you...

19:50.060 --> 19:52.020
the more into you I get.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.940
You've got this brilliant knack
of keeping everything...

19:56.940 --> 19:58.980
compartmentalised.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.260
And I used to be like that.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.140
And until I met you...

20:04.180 --> 20:06.260
..I was just sleeping.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.460
I know that you are...

20:08.460 --> 20:10.860
the most fantastic,

20:10.860 --> 20:13.780
beautiful thing
that's come into my life for...

20:15.620 --> 20:17.620
..as long as I can remember.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.100
And...I wanna see inside your flat.

20:21.100 --> 20:24.060
And I wanna meet your friends,
even the mad ones.

20:24.060 --> 20:26.100
And...at some point...

20:26.100 --> 20:28.740
God forbid, I may even
wanna meet your parents.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
But...

20:33.900 --> 20:36.020
it is...

20:36.020 --> 20:39.060
painfully obvious
from where I'm sitting that you...

20:39.060 --> 20:40.820
don't want any of that stuff.

20:40.820 --> 20:42.900
And...

20:42.900 --> 20:44.660
if I'm honest,

20:44.660 --> 20:47.100
I don't know if I want to carry on
with something

20:47.100 --> 20:50.260
that's gonna get deeper for me
and more and more awkward and...

20:50.260 --> 20:52.220
problematic for you.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.060
There you go.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
I said it.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.180
Could you please say something?

21:17.820 --> 21:19.740
I love you.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.300
(Fuck.)

21:26.900 --> 21:30.500
Today. I'm gonna tell Alex today.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.140
You're just somebody my dad's paid
to sleep with me.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.220
So, it's er, going well
with you two?

21:35.220 --> 21:36.980
You and er, Alex?
Yeah.

21:36.980 --> 21:38.820
You're in love with her.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.300
See, I'm a real girl.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.260
I've got a girlfriend, Alex.
Yeah (!)

21:42.260 --> 21:43.980
What's her name?
