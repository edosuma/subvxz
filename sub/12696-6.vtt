WEBVTT

00:07.700 --> 00:09.967
- *

00:10.067 --> 00:11.567
- Oh, sorry we had to
leave the carnival early.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.767
I just really didn't like the
look of those troublemakers.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.467
Don't worry, our next date
will be clown free.

00:20.567 --> 00:21.933
Okay.

00:22.033 --> 00:24.767
- NORA, CHLOE & BILLY:
Ooooooh!

00:24.867 --> 00:27.400
See ya, buddy.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.967
- Yeah!

00:29.067 --> 00:30.633
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

00:30.733 --> 00:34.333
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt.

00:34.433 --> 00:37.100
- NORA, CHLOE & BILLY:
Ooooooh!

00:37.200 --> 00:39.967
- Okay, how does that
even make sense?

00:40.067 --> 00:41.533
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
Hello, Phoebe.

00:41.633 --> 00:43.333
The Hero League needs
you to investigate

00:43.433 --> 00:46.500
one of our most dastardly
super villains.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.267
You must tell no one.

00:48.367 --> 00:51.133
- This is so awesome.
My first big take-down.

00:51.233 --> 00:53.833
Who's the unlucky,
soon

00:53.933 --> 00:56.300
- Evil Man.
- Well, he is goin' down.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.867
I'm sorry,
did you say Evil Man?

00:58.967 --> 01:01.267
As in Link's Dad, Evil Man?

01:01.367 --> 01:03.600
- Even though he claims
he's retired,

01:03.700 --> 01:07.133
we have evidence that suggests
he's up to his old tricks.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.900
- Okay, um, if it's
all right with you,

01:09.067 --> 01:11.700
before I investigate my
boyfriend's dad for being evil,

01:11.800 --> 01:14.667
I'm gonna have to see
some of this so-called evidence.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.833
- Guess who has two thumbs
and just got hired

01:16.933 --> 01:19.067
by Evil Man to be
his evil protégé?

01:19.100 --> 01:21.700
This guy!

01:21.800 --> 01:24.200
Viva la evil!

01:26.133 --> 01:28.267
Evil Man just hired
Max to--Oh...

01:28.367 --> 01:30.733
- Yeah, we're good.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.067
- *

01:35.133 --> 01:36.267
* What you see

01:36.367 --> 01:37.900
* Is not what you get

01:38.067 --> 01:41.067
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:41.167 --> 01:42.800
* We fit right in

01:42.900 --> 01:44.267
* Bet you never guessed

01:44.367 --> 01:45.800
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

01:45.900 --> 01:47.400
* Just like all the rest

01:47.500 --> 01:49.133
* A picture
perfect family *

01:49.233 --> 01:51.233
* Is what we try to be

01:51.333 --> 01:52.633
* Look closer,
you might see *

01:52.733 --> 01:54.233
* The crazy things we do

01:54.333 --> 01:55.967
* This isn't
make believe *

01:56.067 --> 01:57.700
* It's our reality

01:57.800 --> 01:59.167
* Just your average family

01:59.267 --> 02:02.267
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:02.367 --> 02:06.133
* Livin' a double life

02:09.300 --> 02:11.967
- Look, Phoebe,
I'm a superhero, too.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.667
I'm Popper Fingers.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.067
- Oh, sorry, Cherry,
I'm just, um...

02:19.167 --> 02:20.933
I'm distracted thinking
about something.

02:21.067 --> 02:22.733
Maybe I can help.

02:22.833 --> 02:23.800
- Well, it's just that--

02:23.900 --> 02:25.633
unh, I probably
shouldn't tell you this.

02:25.733 --> 02:32.133
Um, okay, I have a superhero
friend named "Fiona"

02:32.233 --> 02:33.567
whose boyfriend's dad

02:33.667 --> 02:37.533
is a huge villain named,
um, "Evil Stan."

02:37.633 --> 02:39.967
- That Stan sounds
like an evil man.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.867
- He's retired now but,
if he's up to no good again,

02:42.967 --> 02:44.633
"Fiona" has to turn him in.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.167
- Fiona better turn
that man in.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.067
- But what about
her boyfriend--

02:48.100 --> 02:50.167
"Crink"?

02:50.267 --> 02:52.733
- Crink, schmink,
she's a superhero.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.300
Besides, what if his dad does
something horrible--

02:54.400 --> 02:56.500
like erases November?

02:56.600 --> 03:00.400
My birthday's in November.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.233
- You're right, Fiona
has to do what's right.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.500
Also, your birthday's
in December.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.133
- *

03:11.233 --> 03:13.500
- MAX: Yeah, yeah, got it.
All right.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.500
Thanks again for
bringing me on

03:15.600 --> 03:17.167
to teach me your
evil ways, Evil Man.

03:17.267 --> 03:21.500
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here, I'm Mr. Evilman.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.933
- Right. Your cover.

03:24.067 --> 03:28.133
Mild-mannered owner of this
family mattress store.

03:28.233 --> 03:30.567
- First of all,
thanks to bedbug season,

03:30.667 --> 03:32.200
we're doing quite well.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.800
And, second,
I only hired you

03:33.900 --> 03:35.700
because a tiny lady
just quit on me

03:35.800 --> 03:37.867
and you look like
you'll fit the uniform.

03:40.133 --> 03:44.333
- You're doing a great job at
pretending you don't like me.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.833
You brought
your daddy

03:49.933 --> 03:53.067
to wipe your boom-boom
on your first day?

03:53.167 --> 03:56.233
- Hey, I handle
my own boom-boom.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.300
And I thought he left
after he dropped me off.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.700
Hank!
- Oh, hey.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.467
- Well, I see your butt
has good taste.

04:05.567 --> 04:09.200
You found the couchtress--
part couch, part mattress,

04:09.300 --> 04:11.300
all comfort.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.967
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

04:15.067 --> 04:16.367
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:16.467 --> 04:18.167
Comfort ain't cheap.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.967
- Ah, I'm gonna have
to sleep on it.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.233
- When he wakes up,
I'll close the deal.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.933
- Whoa, whoa,
that's not your job.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.167
That is your job.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.767
Any time someone comes
in or leaves,

04:34.867 --> 04:37.533
you make sure those
doors get closed.

04:37.633 --> 04:40.467
All the cold air's
gettin' out!

04:42.900 --> 04:45.400
- Oh, I get it.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.400
Keeping the doors
shut teaches me

04:47.500 --> 04:50.733
to keep my mouth shut
if I'm ever interrogated.

04:52.967 --> 04:56.733
- Wink at me again and I'll
take your eyelids.

04:58.867 --> 05:01.600
- Come on, Chloe,
we're leaving for the park.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.200
Let's do it!

05:04.300 --> 05:06.400
- Let's un-do it.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.967
- What are you
talking about?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.533
She looks adorable.

05:09.633 --> 05:13.800
Come on, sweetie, let's go
put on some sunscreen, hm?

05:13.900 --> 05:16.567
- We cannot let her go
to the park like that.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.367
Everyone will laugh at her.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.767
- I know. She went to
the zoo last week,

05:20.867 --> 05:22.333
and she got more looks
than that chimp

05:22.433 --> 05:25.267
chewing on that
poor kid's ear.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.567
- Better.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.300
- All right, let's go.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.867
- Uh, yeah, about the park.

05:32.967 --> 05:36.700
I bet it's really crowded,
don't you think, Billy?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.667
- I'll check.

05:39.767 --> 05:43.933
It is packed.
A ten-kid pile-up on the slide.

05:44.067 --> 05:47.167
- Oh, well, I guess we'll
have to go another time.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.700
Come on, Chloe.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.467
- We just saved Chloe
from total embarrassment.

05:52.567 --> 05:54.367
- Up top.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.700
- Ow! That's not
how it works!

05:57.800 --> 06:01.833
- *

06:01.933 --> 06:06.267
- Tie clip cam,
meet Max's ugly tie.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.433
Together, you are
gonna show me

06:08.533 --> 06:11.300
what twisted shenanigans
Evil Man is up to.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.500
But, first, extreme close-up!

06:14.600 --> 06:16.800
Whoa! Whoa!

06:32.267 --> 06:35.133
- I can't find anything
comfortable in the whole house.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.067
- Hey, looking good, Max.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.933
You, uh, on your way
to a dweeb rally?

06:42.067 --> 06:45.967
You goin' to a--

06:46.067 --> 06:48.900
you're a dweeb rally?

06:49.067 --> 06:52.267
- Hey, Max, do you need
a ride to the couchtress?

06:53.733 --> 06:55.100
- I'm aware of what I said.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.100
Meet me at the car!

06:59.767 --> 07:01.633
- Uh, Phoebe, have you
seen my tie?

07:01.733 --> 07:02.900
- Oh, yeah, it's right
over there.

07:03.067 --> 07:05.900
Mom said she left
a gift on it for you.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.933
- Oh, fancy.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.500
I'll be the best-dressed
guy at my new evil job.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.800
I mean, regular job.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.333
- Oh, it's become
a problem.

07:22.433 --> 07:25.267
It was a bed
and like that...

07:25.367 --> 07:26.767
it's this thing.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.833
- Whoa, the future is now.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.933
I'll take one.
- Awesome.

07:32.067 --> 07:34.333
Uh, pull your car around,
we'll get you taken care of.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.300
- Max.
- Uh, sorry.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.933
I'll get back to the doors.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.900
- No, no, no, no.
I'm impressed.

07:42.067 --> 07:45.333
I'm promoting you
to sales trainee.

07:45.433 --> 07:49.600
- Is that code for
"evil deputy"?

07:49.700 --> 07:51.433
- You can call yourself
whatever you want,

07:51.533 --> 07:54.333
so long as you keep
pushin' the cushion.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.300
- Come on.
You brought your dad back?

08:00.400 --> 08:04.400
Hank?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.367
- Hank!

08:06.467 --> 08:09.067
- HANK: Ah!

08:09.167 --> 08:10.633
- Come on.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.633
You just can't sit
on the couchtress all day.

08:12.733 --> 08:14.600
- This is a big decision.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.333
I need to simulate my exact
nighttime routine.

08:17.433 --> 08:20.233
Can you rub my feet and let
me talk about my day?

08:22.700 --> 08:24.300
- Uh-oh. Oh.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.067
Hey! Ho! Ho!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:26.167 --> 08:29.100
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
this mattress isn't for sale.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.567
How about some, uh, some
stickers for the kid?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.800
There we go.
So...so cute.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.600
I'm...I'm so sorry.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.400
You cannot sell
this mattress.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.300
It's my nap mattress.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.467
Okay? So don't go
near it again.

08:43.567 --> 08:44.700
You got it?

08:44.800 --> 08:47.233
Go rub your dad's feet.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.667
- He sure is acting weird
about that sad little bed.

08:52.767 --> 08:55.367
I'm sensing twisted
shenanigans.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.767
- No one.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.567
Where are you going?

09:01.667 --> 09:04.433
- Nowhere.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.067
- All right, then.
- Don't wait up.

09:06.133 --> 09:11.367
- *

09:11.467 --> 09:13.467
- That feeling you're
experiencing right now,

09:13.567 --> 09:16.467
Chloe, is awesomeness.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.867
- My head itches.

09:20.167 --> 09:25.500
- What in Bikini Bottom
is happening right now?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.433
You two look exactly alike.

09:27.533 --> 09:31.467
- You're right, she looks great
and she's lovin' it.

09:31.567 --> 09:36.167
- My head is on fire.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.900
- Girl, your whole look
is on fire.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.333
- *

09:46.433 --> 09:48.800
Thanks for
coming with me, Cherry.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.367
- Well, it was either this

09:50.467 --> 09:52.800
or stay at home and watch
my dad clip his toenails.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.133
- Yeah, well, here you
can watch my dad do it.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.933
- So, bet you didn't know
that the actual

10:01.033 --> 10:03.567
Mattress Mike worked
here, did you?

10:03.667 --> 10:05.600
- Yeah.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.167
And I hear he needs
dancers for his next one.

10:08.267 --> 10:10.300
- I'm gonna go show
him my moves.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.733
Yo, Mattress Mike!

10:13.833 --> 10:16.733
And a-one, and a-two,
and a-three,

10:16.833 --> 10:18.867
and a-four and a-five!

10:18.967 --> 10:20.833
Hatcha! Hatcha! Hatcha!

10:20.933 --> 10:23.133
- Thank you, Cherry.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.533
- Isn't there
a Mr. Old Lady

10:28.633 --> 10:30.833
that can be helping
you out with this?

10:37.867 --> 10:40.100
- Okay, mattress,
reveal your secrets.

10:42.133 --> 10:45.067
Sleep speedometer?
That's a thing?

10:51.100 --> 10:54.067
- And then there
was a missile.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.767
President Kickbutt, please?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.500
It's a national crisis.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.133
No, don't put me on hold.

11:02.233 --> 11:06.067
Oh, ho, ho, I love
this song.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.933
- Hey, Phoebe, I didn't know

11:08.067 --> 11:09.600
that Mattress Mike
is Link's dad.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.933
He just walked in.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.167
Link is
in the store?

11:13.267 --> 11:14.667
- Uh-huh.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.567
And so is this missile.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.400
- Okay, just don't freak out.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.867
I'm on the line with
the Hero League right now.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.800
- This is just like
your friend Fiona

11:22.900 --> 11:25.900
who has that boyfriend
whose dad is a bad guy and--

11:26.067 --> 11:28.100
Oh, my gosh!

11:28.200 --> 11:29.367
You're Fiona, Link's dad
is Evil Stan,

11:29.467 --> 11:34.067
Link is Crink and that
special is a missile.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.067
Why didn't you just tell me?

11:36.133 --> 11:38.800
- Because I'm not allowed to
tell you Hero League secrets.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.400
That's why I was doing this...

11:40.500 --> 11:44.833
- I thought you were just doing
buddy puppets to help me focus.

11:44.933 --> 11:47.567
Wow, Link is gonna be crushed,
if you turn in his dad.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.667
- Well, hey, I'm just
doing the right thing, remember?

11:49.767 --> 11:50.900
This was your advice.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.600
- That advice was
for Fiona, not you.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.233
If you go through with this,
Link is gonna break up with you.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.833
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT: Phoebe,
did you find something

11:58.933 --> 12:00.800
at Evil Man's mattress store?

12:00.900 --> 12:03.067
- Um...

12:08.367 --> 12:10.067
Never mind.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.633
- I have to turn Evil man in.
I have to.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.433
But I don't wanna
break up with Link.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.267
I don't wanna.
What should I do?

12:20.367 --> 12:22.333
- I shoulda knew.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.700
- Uh-oh, that's Link.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.733
I forgot we're supposed
to hang out tonight.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.933
- Oh, before you
arrest his dad,

12:32.067 --> 12:34.667
will you ask him how
I did on my dance audition?

12:34.767 --> 12:36.733
If it comes up.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.400
Good luck.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.533
- Hey, Link!
You on your way?

12:45.633 --> 12:47.733
- Actually, I have to cancel.
My dad's still at work,

12:47.833 --> 12:49.633
so I'm watching
my little brother.

12:49.733 --> 12:51.267
- But isn't the store
closed at night?

12:51.367 --> 12:54.533
- Yeah, but he's staying late--
some top secret project.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.400
- Yeah, it sounds like he's
about to launch something big.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.700
- I know what he's launching.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.200
- Also, Cherry's banned
from the store.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.767
- It wouldn't be
the first time.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.967
Talk to you later
Gotta go.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.567
- Woo! Ha! Ha!

13:09.667 --> 13:11.600
What a day I had,
Colosso!

13:11.700 --> 13:12.933
I sold three mattresses

13:13.067 --> 13:16.833
and saved Evil Man
$35 on his electric bill.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.533
- Listen to yourself.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.300
Evil Man's not teaching
you anything about being evil.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.767
- Oh, sure he is.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.900
It's all part of
his master plan.

13:25.067 --> 13:26.933
Little by little,
he's grooming me

13:27.067 --> 13:29.767
to become the next
great super villain.

13:29.867 --> 13:33.467
- He's groomin' you to be
his weekend manager.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.333
Look at yourself.

13:39.933 --> 13:44.467
- Holy suburban sales nerd,
what happened to me?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.633
My hair is parting itself?

13:46.733 --> 13:49.067
And is that
a cellphone holster?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.667
I have to go down to
that mattress store

13:52.767 --> 13:55.267
right now and quit.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.900
- That's my Max.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.900
Now make sure you get rid of
that cellphone holster.

13:59.067 --> 14:02.633
- I already did.
Stop doing that!

14:06.067 --> 14:08.600
- And the finishing touch...

14:08.700 --> 14:09.967
a beautiful bow.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.200
Now when Mom and Dad
take us out to dinner,

14:12.300 --> 14:14.333
you won't look ridiculous.

14:14.433 --> 14:17.233
- I feel like
a birthday present.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.967
- That's right, Chloe.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.167
With that bow, you're
a gift to the world.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.700
Look, Billy, I fixed her.

14:29.933 --> 14:31.533
Let it go!
- Give it!

14:31.633 --> 14:33.200
- Never!
- It's mine!

14:33.300 --> 14:35.100
- Whoa! Whoa!
What's goin' on?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.567
- Nora dressed Chloe
up like a doof.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.900
- Only because Billy dressed
her up like a chucklehead.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.933
- I don't wanna be
a chucklehead.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.833
Look, I...I know you're
trying to help

14:47.933 --> 14:49.267
your little sister,

14:49.367 --> 14:51.233
but she likes the way
she dresses.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.600
- Mom, people are
gonna laugh at her,

14:52.700 --> 14:57.067
if she's out there dressed
like a lost and found box.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.100
- Chloe doesn't care about
what other people

14:59.200 --> 15:01.967
think about her clothes,
so why should you two?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.733
You know, maybe you
should care less about

15:03.833 --> 15:07.400
what she's wearing and more
about what she's feeling.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.233
Chuckleheads.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.633
- I think we just got Mom'd.

15:12.733 --> 15:14.700
- BARB: Yeah, ya did.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.333
- Good evening, Evil Man.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.500
- Phoebe, how did
you get in here?

15:23.600 --> 15:27.200
Did your brother leave
those doors open again?

15:27.300 --> 15:28.867
- Yeah, it's about
the missile you're hiding

15:28.967 --> 15:31.067
under that mattress
over there.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.467
- Would you believe
that was there

15:32.567 --> 15:35.467
when I bought the place?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.067
- Look, the Hero League
sent me to bring you in,

15:37.133 --> 15:39.600
but I'm worried what
that will do to Link.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.133
- He's a good kid.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.900
Do you know he and I have
really been bonding lately?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.433
We flew a kite the other day.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.833
It was a ladybug.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.600
- I think you should
turn yourself in.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.067
- Hm...

15:54.133 --> 15:56.867
it doesn't sound like
something I'd do.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.433
- Just think about Link.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.500
He would hate me,
if I turned you in,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.633
and he's really
gonna need somebody

16:02.733 --> 16:04.500
when you're rotting in jail.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.767
- Well...

16:07.867 --> 16:11.500
Since you put it that way!

16:17.633 --> 16:19.200
Me?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.600
Changing the missile's target

16:20.700 --> 16:25.700
from Hiddenville Central Library
to the Hero League.

16:28.833 --> 16:32.133
- Now I hate them
more than books.

16:32.233 --> 16:35.100
- Please! At least put me in
a more comfortable bed.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.900
This one's all springs.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.433
- Suffer!

16:42.267 --> 16:44.800
- Chloe, we're going
to Splatburger now.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.467
You should get ready.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.633
- I don't wanna go.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.300
- We're sorry about what
happened today, Chloe.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.767
We were wrong to tell
you what to wear.

16:55.867 --> 16:57.800
- Yeah, you're not
a chucklehead.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.067
We're the chuckleheads.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.933
- And doofs.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.700
- Huge doofs.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.367
You should just be yourself
and dress how you want.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.833
And we promise to love it.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.800
- Not yet.

17:15.900 --> 17:19.233
Now I forgive you.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.467
- I am so pulling this off.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.133
- I don't know what's
happening here,

17:27.233 --> 17:28.800
but I like it.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.200
And don't let anyone turn you
into a suburban sales nerd.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.500
- What's with
the cellphone holster?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.867
- You are not
a part of me!

17:44.667 --> 17:46.133
- Three minutes...

17:46.233 --> 17:50.367
till the Hero League
is a pile of rubble and spandex.

17:56.667 --> 18:01.167
- *

18:01.267 --> 18:03.767
- Aw, nuts.

18:03.867 --> 18:08.800
- *

18:10.767 --> 18:12.167
- Nice try.

18:12.267 --> 18:14.233
Maybe if you give up now,
they'll go easy on you.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.633
- I'm Evil Man!
Nothing can stop me!

18:20.167 --> 18:24.833
- I can't believe
you stopped me.

18:24.933 --> 18:29.733
Well, too bad you haven't
the guts to turn me in.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.433
You couldn't do that
to your precious Link.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.967
He'd never forgive you.

18:35.067 --> 18:39.067
- Hey, Dad, I'm here.
What'd you need?

18:39.133 --> 18:42.667
Is this for a new
commercial or...?

18:42.767 --> 18:43.967
- It sure is.

18:44.067 --> 18:49.067
We're freezing prices and
blowin' up the competition.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.533
Lie, Phoebe.

18:50.633 --> 18:55.467
This is where you lie to
save your relationship.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.600
- Link, your dad is trying to
destroy the Hero League

18:57.700 --> 18:59.867
and I have to stop him.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.900
- You're probably gonna
break up with me for this,

19:02.067 --> 19:04.133
but I have a job to do.

19:05.633 --> 19:08.133
President Kickbutt, please?

19:08.233 --> 19:09.667
I have Evil Man.

19:09.767 --> 19:11.733
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
Well done!

19:14.833 --> 19:16.600
- Well, that was quick.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.667
- Congratulations.
You passed the test.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.567
- The Hero League
needed to make sure

19:22.667 --> 19:24.433
you were willing to put
your superhero life

19:24.533 --> 19:26.133
ahead of your personal life.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.367
- I know it wasn't easy.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.167
But you just took
a huge step toward

19:33.267 --> 19:35.633
becoming a full-fledged
superhero.

19:35.733 --> 19:38.133
- Okay, as much as I love
passing tests,

19:38.233 --> 19:41.267
that is messed up!

19:41.367 --> 19:43.967
Also, I hope that outburst
doesn't affect my grade.

19:47.933 --> 19:51.500
Link, I'm so sorry I had
to turn your dad in.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.067
I'd completely understand if
you wanna break up with me.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.567
- 'Cause I chose my job
over our relationship.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.767
- It's called
doing the right thing.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.200
And, besides, who would
I have to lean on

20:03.300 --> 20:05.867
while my dad was rotting
away in jail?

20:05.967 --> 20:08.200
- No jail can hold me.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.233
I can break out
of anything.

20:13.467 --> 20:15.233
A little help, Phoebe.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.067
- Ha!

20:20.167 --> 20:24.233
Out of anything.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.700
- MAX: Hey, Evil Man!

20:32.100 --> 20:33.967
- Try closin'
your doors now.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.200
- My doors!

20:39.300 --> 20:41.567
My couchtress!

20:41.667 --> 20:44.333
- Couchtress!

20:47.633 --> 20:51.900
- Wait a minute.
What's everyone doing here?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.533
- Our friend Evil Man
came out of retirement

20:54.633 --> 20:57.300
to help us test your sister.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.900
- You were helping
the Hero League?

21:00.067 --> 21:04.400
- Yeah. They bought a ton
of those flip-up beds.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.633
And they also got
me a fishing boat

21:06.733 --> 21:09.233
you can't tell
your mom about.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.667
- You may have gone
suburban soft,

21:11.767 --> 21:13.600
but I haven't.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.067
Say goodbye, whatever
this is aimed at.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.433
- Way to go, Max.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.767
That ice cream was supposed
to be a surprise for Phoebe.

21:32.867 --> 21:37.067
- Look at that--they have all my
favorite flavors and toppings.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.300
Viva la evil!

21:44.400 --> 21:46.867
Viva la sprinkles!

21:49.433 --> 21:52.933
- Was he wearing
a cellphone holster?

21:54.900 --> 21:57.367
- It should have been me.

21:57.467 --> 22:01.100
Nooooooo!

22:01.200 --> 22:03.100
Is that an ice cream rocket?

22:03.200 --> 22:08.067
- *

22:10.767 --> 22:26.633
- *
