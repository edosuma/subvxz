00:01.293 --> 00:04.546
It seems today that all you see

00:04.671 --> 00:08.300
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.383 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:14.389
On which we used to rely?

00:14.473 --> 00:18.227
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.393 --> 00:21.688
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.772 --> 00:23.232
All the things that make us

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
Laugh and cry

00:25.067 --> 00:29.696
He's a family guy

00:35.869 --> 00:38.455
This was such a great idea
for a weekend activity.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.415
Well, I thought it'd be good
to get out of the house.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.876
I don't like the kids being around
that racist sunflower

00:42.960 --> 00:44.628
that's growing in our yard.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.006
Hey, boy, don't you come walking
by this house.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.216
You're ignorant.

00:52.803 --> 00:55.722
Hey, Mr. Eel. You're slippery.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.432
Oops, got away.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.435
Left my hand smelling funny.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.063
Come here, Jesse. Smell my finger.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.906
Today was a good day.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.995
Hey, look, kids, it's a re-creation
of the lost city of New Orleans.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.337
Dad, was there ever
a real city of New Orleans?

01:27.421 --> 01:30.507
No one knows, Chris. No one knows.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.387
Hey, Brian, look, I'm a stripper.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.306
I'm working my way through college.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.558
I should be more reluctant
to take my clothes off,

01:39.641 --> 01:42.895
but I'm not because
my stepfather had boundary issues.

01:44.646 --> 01:49.151
Hey, there, Mr. Octopus.
I see you got two eyes but not much else.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.861
We can fix that.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.406
Let's give you a nice,
tweedlie little mustache here.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.784
And maybe
a big, old dumb-guy smiley mouth.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.872
And a couple of eyebrows with one
raised up like you're saying, "Say what?"

02:01.997 --> 02:04.166
Look who's got pimples.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.002

-Help! It's so sucky and squeezy!
-I'll handle this.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.469
I've tangled
with the likes of these before.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.268
Wow, that was awesome, Mr. Seamus.

02:23.352 --> 02:26.355
Ah, it was nothing.
That's how I caught old Woody over there.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.823
In other news, former President
Bill Clinton was in town today

02:36.907 --> 02:40.452
to judge Quahog's annual
Miss Cankle USA contest.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.123
Now that's a cankle.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.001
Where does the calf fat end
and the ankle fat begin?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.546
Who knows? That's the fun.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.799
-Brian, what is this on my shoe?
-My poop.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.884
That's right, and it's disgusting.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.470
I am sick of you using the front yard
as your bathroom.

02:58.554 --> 03:01.223
It's time you learned to use the toilet
like everyone else.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.101

I'm going to sneeze, I'm going to sneeze.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.319
Okay, see you... Wait. What?

03:14.403 --> 03:15.821
Since when do you go to the gym?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.656
Well, it's just that whole thing
at the aquarium

03:17.739 --> 03:19.825
made me realize
I'm completely out of shape.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.910
I mean, what if I run into
that octopus again?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.495
Peter, that's ridiculous.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.456
Ready for round two, man? I got all day.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.083
Hey, is that your wife?

03:32.671 --> 03:34.339
Hey, I didn't know you guys
work out here.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.800
Yeah, it's a weekly regimen.
Come on, come on, Cleveland, push it.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.178
Come on, come on, push it, push it.
Push it, come on, it's all you.

Why, look, Barnaby,
a new recreation enthusiast.

03:55.944 --> 04:00.115
We'll start off your workout with vigorous
calisthenics executed in rhythmic time

of the new musical craze called jazz.

-How do you think it works?
-I have no idea.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.391
Look, Lois told me
I had to start using the toilet

04:26.475 --> 04:27.768
and you're the one
who's had potty training,

04:27.851 --> 04:29.311
so I'm counting on you to help me.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.898
All right, we're two intelligent guys.
We can figure this out.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.859
What's that big back part?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.862
Maybe that's where the wizard lives
who operates this thing.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.989
It would be wise not to anger him.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.282
I wonder what this thing is for.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.785
Brian, be careful with that.
We don't know what it does.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.774
Meg, you are so full of crap.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.985
You're like those people
who sit in Starbucks

05:18.068 --> 05:20.237
and publicly write on their laptops.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.072
Hey, getting some writing
done there, buddy?

05:22.155 --> 05:26.118
Yeah, setting up in public so everybody
can watch me type my big screenplay.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.620
Me, too.
All real writers need to be seen writing.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.122
Otherwise, what's the point, right?

05:30.247 --> 05:33.208
-You should totally write that down.
-Okay. Will you watch me?

for 15 minutes.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.343
And I'm 15 minutes stronger, Brian.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.470
I'd rip a phone book in half,
but for the life of me,

05:45.554 --> 05:47.681
I don't know anyone who uses
a phone book anymore.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.349

(LAUGHING)

11:08.961 --> 11:10.963
All right. I'm starved. Let's do it.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.841
(PIG SQUEALING)

11:15.425 --> 11:16.426
Who's there?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.470
Oh, crap! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:20.597 --> 11:25.060
Doggone it! If he wanted a pig,
why didn't he just take my wife?

11:25.143 --> 11:26.812
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:26.895 --> 11:30.232
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Twitty.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.568
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

11:32.693 --> 11:35.404
(YOUR LOVE HAD TAKEN ME
THAT HIGH PLAYING)

11:50.294 --> 11:52.504
Hello, old friend.

11:52.588 --> 11:53.589
(SCREAMING)

11:53.672 --> 11:54.882
What the hell?

11:54.965 --> 11:58.385
No! No! You do not go on this lawn!

11:58.552 --> 12:00.095
Brian, I've had enough of this.

12:00.179 --> 12:03.140
It's more disgusting than
when you gave me that Christmas gift.

12:03.307 --> 12:06.351
Oh, what is it? A little birdie?

12:06.435 --> 12:10.480
Oh! Oh, my God! It's dead! Brian!

12:10.647 --> 12:13.567
Oh! Oh, Brian, this is disgusting!

12:13.650 --> 12:16.361
-Oh, my God! Get it out of here!
-I'm... I'm sorry.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.030
I thought... I thought you'd like it.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.032
Brian, I love it!

12:20.157 --> 12:24.620
I'm going to call you Stickyhead.
I love you, Stickyhead.

12:24.703 --> 12:28.332
Brian, if you're not going to use
the toilet, there's only one solution.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.668
Hey, Brian, did you know
that Brad Pitt is John Lithgow's nephew?

12:31.752 --> 12:32.753
-He is?
-No,

12:32.836 --> 12:34.546
but doesn't that sound like
something that could be true?

12:34.630 --> 12:38.050
Oh, my God! You're wearing a diaper!
You look silly.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.594
-Why? You wear a diaper.
-Yes, but I'm a baby.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.929
People see my diaper, and they say,

12:42.012 --> 12:44.598
"Oh, how cute!
I bet he smells like baby powder."

12:44.681 --> 12:47.809
They see your diaper and think,
"That dog is sick. He must be dying.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.687
"I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet.
Why don't they just put him to sleep?"

12:50.771 --> 12:52.689
You know, at this point,
I'd probably welcome that.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.526
Oh, hey, come on, man.
You just got to get used to it.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.612
Hey, have you gone yet?
Have you popped your butt cherry?

12:58.695 --> 13:01.198
You know, you should be more sensitive
to my humiliation.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.284
Remember how bad you felt when
you drew that picture for Peter and Lois?

13:04.368 --> 13:09.164
-Oh, Stewie, it's wonderful!
-This is going right up on the fridge.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.707
Really? The fridge?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.502
It's like we have
a little Michelangelo in the house.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.171
Okay! See you guys later.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.386
I almost lost it
when you said to put it on the fridge.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.139
I know! I mean, what the hell is this
supposed to be, a pelican or a school bus?

13:26.223 --> 13:28.058
Looks like Muhammad Ali drew this.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.602
What a dumb ass! Hey, let's spit on it.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.569
-Peter!
-Oh! Oh, Lois.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.988
Oh... Let me make you some coffee.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.198
(SQUEALING)

13:45.284 --> 13:48.370
CHRIS: Oh, boy, a pig!
Can we keep it? It bit me!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.664
What the hell
did you and Bill do last night?

13:50.747 --> 13:53.500
We lived, Lois. We lived our lives.

13:53.584 --> 13:56.837
Peter, that former President Clinton
is nothing but a bad influence!

13:56.920 --> 13:59.464
I forbid you to hang out with him anymore.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.009
No way.
Bill Clinton makes me feel young.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.052
Not like you,
with your Judd Hirsch sweater

14:04.136 --> 14:06.597
and your bag of Werther's Originals.

14:07.139 --> 14:11.560
Well, if he won't listen, I'm just going
to have to go talk to Bill Clinton myself.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.524
Mr. President, I need to have
a word with you!

14:17.691 --> 14:21.320
Wow! You certainly are very persuasive.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.779
So I've been told.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.324
Hey, you wanna give me that cigar?
I'm ready to smoke it now.

14:30.162 --> 14:34.166
What the hell was I thinking?
I don't know what came over me.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.293
Oh, God! What am I going to do?

14:36.376 --> 14:39.671
Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling?
I swiped some money out of Lois's purse.

14:39.755 --> 14:43.550
I don't think she'll notice because
she's here humping you!

14:43.634 --> 14:47.095
Peter! Look, I know this looks bad,
and I feel horrible,

14:47.179 --> 14:49.598
and I know nothing I could say to you

14:49.681 --> 14:53.268
could possibly justify
why I slept with Bill except...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.478
I mean, Peter,

14:54.561 --> 14:59.525
the man presided over the longest
economic expansion in US history,

15:00.025 --> 15:03.070
and he reduced
the percentage of Americans on welfare

15:03.153 --> 15:06.573
to its lowest level in 33 years.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.201
-35 years.
-35 years, Peter.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.371
Well, well. I learned something today.

15:12.454 --> 15:15.457
Apparently, there's the side
of Bill Clinton the world knows,

15:15.541 --> 15:18.794
and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side
only I know.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.712
I'm so sorry, Peter.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.716
Lois, I think maybe it's better
if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.218
I understand.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.262
Hey, Lois, you up
for a little exit polling?

15:28.679 --> 15:30.806
Oh, God! I've been a worse wife

15:30.973 --> 15:33.684
than Lorena Bobbitt
when she was married to the Thing.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.937
Oh, my God! Where is it?
Where did she throw it? Oh, God! Oh, God!

15:37.020 --> 15:39.022
Is this what you're looking for?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.402
I can't believe Lois would cheat on me.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.029
Look, Peter, I know this is
a very difficult time for you,

15:46.113 --> 15:49.283
but I want you to know I'm...
I'm here for you if you need anything.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.119
Quagmire, I know your heart's
in the right place,

15:52.202 --> 15:54.705
but I need to sort this out for myself.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.749
I haven't misjudged someone this bad
since my last physical.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.795
All right.
The doctor will be in in a few minutes.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.005
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

16:03.088 --> 16:06.049
LOIS: Peter? Peter, are you in there?
It's me.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.051
What do you want?

16:08.135 --> 16:11.180
Honey, I just feel awful
about this whole situation.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.475
Peter, I think I've got a solution
that'll make things right for both of us.

16:15.559 --> 16:16.560
I'm listening.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.105
Well, the way I figure it, the only way
to even things out between us

16:20.189 --> 16:22.566
is if you have sex with someone else, too.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.694
You want to get me laid?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.447
Yes, Peter,
because I don't want to lose you.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.284
Well, it would make us even. All right,
Lois, if you really think it'll work.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.162
Trust me. It'll work better
than the first telephone.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.040
Well, we did it, Watson.
What an afternoon.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.334
We've finally perfected
the first telephone.

16:40.417 --> 16:44.213
Yeah. Hey, listen,
somebody called me today.

16:44.338 --> 16:47.382
Whoever it was said some
very sexual things.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.676
Some very angry, sexual things.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.721
Oh, really?
Probably just some teenagers somewhere.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.515
-Damn them.
-(STUTTERING) Well, that's the thing.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.184
I mean, there's only two phones in the...

16:57.267 --> 17:00.020
Well, in the world, and one of them
is in my office,

17:00.103 --> 17:01.855
and the other's in your office,

17:01.939 --> 17:05.067
and those two didn't even exist
until about a few hours ago.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.945
Yikes! I could use a distraction
right now.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.114
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.784
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

17:15.869 --> 17:17.663
(YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS FAR BEFORE PLAYING)

17:33.387 --> 17:36.765
All right, Peter, who's it going to be?
Who do you want to sleep with?

17:36.849 --> 17:39.351
Who we kidding, Lois?
This is never going to work.

17:39.434 --> 17:43.021
-Let's just forget the whole thing.
-No, honey, it's got to work.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.399
Just pick somebody,
and I'll make it happen.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.569
Deep down, in your heart of hearts,
if it could be anyone in the world,

17:48.652 --> 17:51.655
who would it be?
Halle Berry? Ann-Margret?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.657
-Anybody I want?
-Anybody.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.702
-Don't be afraid to tell me.
-Babs.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.579
-My mother?
-Yeah.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.664
Why?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.750
It was my understanding that there
would be no questions asked.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.836
I'm just curious. It's a little weird.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.881
Look, you know what? She's hot.
Guilty, all right?

18:08.964 --> 18:10.966
I haven't been so struck
by a woman's beauty

18:11.049 --> 18:14.595
since I was Uma Thurman's eye-wrangler
on the set of Pulp Fiction.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.140
No. You can't promise something like that.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.267
I have no idea
what you're going to say to me.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.436
So you can go ahead
and say what you're going to say

18:22.519 --> 18:24.646
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.691
Then, through no fault of my own,
I wouldn't have kept my promise.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.151
PETER: Hang on!

18:31.111 --> 18:32.237
Okay!

18:34.364 --> 18:37.618
Well, Lois, this is
an unexpected surprise.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.745
You and Peter should drop by more often.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.289
Well, we were in the neighborhood,
and Peter said,

18:42.372 --> 18:44.625
"Let's stop in." Wasn't that thoughtful?

18:44.708 --> 18:47.628
Will you people quiet down?
I'm trying to watch Medium.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.046
You know what? Daddy's right.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.548
Let's go upstairs
where we won't bother him.

18:51.715 --> 18:56.512
Good. All right. Go, Medium!
Wish I could talk to ghosts.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.263
That would be sweet!

18:58.514 --> 19:02.476
Mom, could we sit down for a second?
I have to ask you something.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.685
What is it, Lois?

19:03.769 --> 19:06.230
Well, Peter and I have hit
a snag in our marriage.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.315
I won't go into details.

19:08.565 --> 19:12.903
But it turns out that the only way
to make things right seems to be...

19:13.362 --> 19:17.741
It... It's, uh...
Oh, boy, what's the best way to say this?

19:18.992 --> 19:22.120
Mom, would you have sex with Peter?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.373
-Of course, dear.
-Really?

19:24.456 --> 19:28.627
Carter's been most insufferable lately,
and this would just stick in his craw.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.672
I like your freaky spirit,
but it's your craw I'm after.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.757
I didn't think you'd be so receptive.

19:33.882 --> 19:37.427
Are you kidding, Lois?
I'm physically starved.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.930
Your father's utterly lost interest.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.516
He won't even look me
in the back of the head anymore.

19:42.599 --> 19:45.853
I see.
Well, I guess we're good to go then.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.980
Peter, are you sure this is what you want?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.606
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

19:53.652 --> 19:54.653
(SIGHS)

19:54.736 --> 19:56.446
PETER: Lois, wait!

19:58.574 --> 20:00.951
I can't do it! I can't go through with it!

20:01.034 --> 20:03.537
You have to, Peter,
for the sake of our marriage!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.456
-Screw our marriage! I love you!
-Really?

20:06.540 --> 20:09.209
Absolutely. And I don't care
that you slept with Clinton.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.711
We'll get past it somehow.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.464
All I know is, I don't want
to do anything to hurt you.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.842
Oh, Peter!

20:18.051 --> 20:20.804
Why are you naked in my house?

20:21.722 --> 20:23.932
Why aren't you?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.893
You're all right, Griffin.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.899
Well, Peter, our marriage
has suffered a serious trial,

20:31.982 --> 20:33.734
but I think we can get through it.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.486
Me, too, Lois.
It's just going to take a little work.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.239
In the meantime, I guess
I better clear the air with Clinton.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.744
Hey, listen, Bill,
you and I need to have a talk.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.914
Boy, you are good. You are really good.

20:56.089 --> 21:00.052
Well, look at you using the toilet.
I am so proud of you.

21:00.135 --> 21:03.013
Hey, well, you deserve all the praise
for encouraging me to do it.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.307
Well, still, good for you.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.768
So where are you really doing
your business?

21:07.851 --> 21:09.478
Oh, I found a place.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.066
Well, I'll be damned.
And they called me crazy.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.902
You can't plant sausage seeds, they said.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.987
Well, look at this.
