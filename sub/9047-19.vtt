00:02.268 --> 00:03.102
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:04.470
Matty, this is
my friend bailey.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.971
- Thank you for coming.
- So are we okay?

00:06.974 --> 00:07.973
- Yeah.
- Hunter, huh?

00:07.975 --> 00:09.408
- She got really drunk
and threw up on herself.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.142
- That's a bummer.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.011
- I'd rather hang out
with someone else instead.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.512
- During my sanity sabbatical,

00:13.514 --> 00:14.613
I wrote a mean essay
about val.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.349
- It's ms. Marks.
I've been fired.

00:19.319 --> 00:19.952
[cell phone beeps]

00:19.954 --> 00:22.021
- After my recent walk
on the wild side,

00:22.023 --> 00:24.723
I had course-corrected
and was determined

00:24.725 --> 00:27.092
To stay on the straight
and narrow.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.128
But I had to admit,
hanging outside

00:29.130 --> 00:32.296
A low-rent liquor store
in a sketch part of town

00:32.299 --> 00:35.200
Gave me
a crazy adrenaline rush.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.202
Okay, mr. Hutcherson.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.937
Date of birth.
- 1985.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.172
- '89.
Address.

00:40.174 --> 00:44.109
- 1266...Kenilworth avenue.

00:44.111 --> 00:44.643
Both: Lane.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.912
- Okay, let's give him
an easy one.

00:46.914 --> 00:50.082
Um, mr. Hutcherson,
where was this license issued?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.584
- At the dmv.
[laughter]

00:52.586 --> 00:54.720
- State, smartass.
- Montana.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.521
- California.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.523
- Dude, you have, like,
five things to remember.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.858
- I didn't know we were
gonna have a frickin' quiz.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.326
- Okay, well,
we are really about to enjoy

01:01.328 --> 01:03.295
That case of soda
you're about to buy.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.663
- Watch this.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.165
- No, we can't go in yet.
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.267
- You need to have this down.
- I do.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.201
- You don't.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.569
With a name
like van hutcherson,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.337
You are asking
to get busted.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.073
This is
the worst fake I.D. Ever.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.242
- Oh, but the letterman's jacket
was a nice touch.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.911
[laughs]

01:18.913 --> 01:21.680
- [bleep].
I forgot to take it off.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.516
- Why don't we just get that guy
to buy us beer?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.318
- [gags]
[vomits]

01:26.320 --> 01:28.787
[coughs]
- oh.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.790
[upbeat latin music]

01:31.792 --> 01:34.359
[man singing in spanish]

01:34.361 --> 01:36.795
- I think we should just bail.
- It's fine.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.063
Nobody ever gets
carded here.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.232
Nussbaum employees
are mostly carnies or ex-cons

01:40.234 --> 01:43.435
Who either can't read
or don't care.

01:43.437 --> 01:47.806
- Can I help you?

01:48.374 --> 01:50.042
- I was just using this
as a weight.

01:50.044 --> 01:54.413
- Yeah, yeah.
You've heard of beer-lates?

01:56.149 --> 01:56.915
- What are you doing here?

01:56.917 --> 02:00.552
- Just pulling a paycheck,
eating my feelings,

02:00.554 --> 02:01.353
Watching my dreams die,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.689
Oh, getting
a 45% off discount

02:03.691 --> 02:05.257
On expired booze,
which helps me

02:05.259 --> 02:07.359
On my quest
to drink my youth away,

02:07.361 --> 02:10.027
Which I am also doing.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.263
- Val, I am so sorry.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.998
I wish I'd never written
that essay.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.299
If I could take it back,
I would.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.436
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.371
- I may be immune
to your bullets,

02:19.373 --> 02:21.473
Jenna-dict arnold,
but your words

02:21.475 --> 02:24.676
Put a hole
in my heart.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.613
I treated you as a friend,
as a confidante,

02:27.615 --> 02:29.581
As a brother
from another mother,

02:29.583 --> 02:31.350
And how do you repay me?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.518
Do you name a star
after me?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.921
Do you send me
an edible fruit basket?

02:35.923 --> 02:36.388
Mm-mm.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.923
Do you offer me
my weight in euros?

02:37.925 --> 02:41.126
No.
You ruin my life.

02:41.128 --> 02:41.727
- It was true.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.029
Valerie had always been there
for me,

02:44.031 --> 02:46.532
And she didn't deserve
her bad fortune.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.900
I was the one
who had wronged her.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.601
I was the one
with the crappy karma.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.005
So why wasn't I the one working
in a creepy liquor store,

02:53.007 --> 02:56.475
Eating beef jerky and red hots
to fill my empty soul?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.910
- You know what?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.912
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

02:59.914 --> 03:00.512
- Name it.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.481
- Go [bleep] yourself.
- What?

03:02.483 --> 03:06.785
- I said,
jenna hamilton,

03:06.787 --> 03:09.488
Go [bleep] yourself.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.391
[feedback]

03:12.393 --> 03:16.161
[typing]

03:17.096 --> 03:19.998
[bell rings]

03:20.000 --> 03:20.933
- Get your prom tickets,

03:20.935 --> 03:23.168
On sale in the junior quad
right now.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.238
If you ain't got a date,
do like the titans do.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.407
Buy now, ask later.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.276
Get your prom tickets.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.145
- Sorry about that.

03:33.147 --> 03:36.148
[upbeat music]

03:36.150 --> 03:37.616
- Hey, jenna.
- Hey.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.786
- Mr. Hutcherson.
- Class of '89.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.955
- Now you remember?

03:42.957 --> 03:45.991
- What's wrong
with this stupid locker?

03:45.993 --> 03:48.627
- It's not yours.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.795
Why are you
so out of it today?

03:49.797 --> 03:51.763
- I can't stop thinking
about valerie.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.065
It doesn't feel right
that my life

03:53.067 --> 03:55.734
Is on the upswing
while she's going through hell,

03:55.736 --> 03:56.802
Especially when
it's all my fault.

03:56.804 --> 04:01.240
- She did all those crazy,
really inappropriate things.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.274
All you did was write about it.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.141
Let it go.
- I can't.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.310
- Did you ever think this could
be a good thing for her?

04:05.312 --> 04:06.178
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.412
Maybe she'll come out
the other end

04:07.414 --> 04:09.014
With a better job
or something.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.949
You know what the say,
what doesn't kill us

04:10.951 --> 04:11.617
Makes us stronger.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.319
- I could only hope
that was true for valerie.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.355
But I knew it was true
for matty and me.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.755
We had been
through so much,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.558
And yet we're closer
than ever.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.226
Sure, we were just friends,

04:21.228 --> 04:23.428
But my relationship
with jake worked

04:23.430 --> 04:24.796
Because we took it slow.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.431
Maybe it was better
for matty and me

04:26.433 --> 04:31.169
To start as friends
and work towards the benefits.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.475
- If you're trying
to do magic, don't.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.510
I hate it.
- How can anybody hate magic?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.012
- I don't know.
It creeps me.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.180
- Maybe not now,
but one day,

04:42.182 --> 04:45.517
You will learn to love magic
as much as you love me.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.288
- [scoffs]
doubt it.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.057
- Saved it up from putting in
electronic dog fences,

04:52.059 --> 04:53.892
Something I'm
ethically opposed to.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.327
So this is basically
blood money,

04:55.329 --> 04:57.996
But it was for a good cause:
Prom tickets.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.365
- Sweet, but hold on
to your cash.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.000
I can get them for free.
- How?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.735
- By using the good kind
of magic:

05:03.737 --> 05:05.771
The asian kind.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.640
[snaps fingers]

05:08.642 --> 05:11.877
Where are
my asians at?

05:13.546 --> 05:17.182
[sighs]
it's dead.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.917
Hey, henry?
Henry.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.919
Hit me up later.
Mama's gotta do business.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.223
- Stop talking like a pimp.
- Stop doing magic.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.858
Dude,
why are you ignoring me?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.093
And how come
after I snap my fingers,

05:28.095 --> 05:29.695
There aren't any asians
in my face?

05:29.697 --> 05:32.798
If there's something going on,
you have to tell me.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.632
You owe me that.

05:33.634 --> 05:38.303
You and I have pretended
to go through a lot together.

05:39.405 --> 05:42.507
- Coup d'etat.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.579
- What does that mean?

05:49.315 --> 05:51.717
[gasps]

05:54.620 --> 05:55.554
[both gasp]

05:55.556 --> 05:56.355
Both: A coup d'etat?

05:56.357 --> 05:58.857
- Which I thought was french
for "fancy brunch"

05:58.859 --> 06:01.293
But actually means "sudden
overthrow, often violent."

06:01.295 --> 06:03.195
- Putting the mascot head
in your locker

06:03.197 --> 06:04.196
Was seriously disturbing.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.231
- And physically impossible.
How did they get it in there?

06:06.233 --> 06:09.000
- I'm guessing it's some type
of head-shrinking technique.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.036
- By some kind
of insaniac.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.404
[gasps]
do you think becca's back?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.139
- No, they hated her
more than me.

06:14.141 --> 06:17.109
I bet
it's that ass[bleep] isaiah.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.643
[sighs]
this is my own damn fault.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.046
I abused my power,
and now it's coming back

06:21.048 --> 06:23.949
To bite me in the ass

06:23.951 --> 06:24.850
Or perhaps kill me.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.818
- Apparently,
everyone was feeling

06:26.820 --> 06:27.786
The effects of karma.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.921
Question was,
how long would it last?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.123
- I should've seen
this coming.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.958
Last week,
I lost my parking spot--

06:32.960 --> 06:34.326
- I can't even remember
the last time

06:34.328 --> 06:35.293
An asian brought you
a latte.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.662
- And my secret hotline's
gone cold.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.231
See?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.400
[bleep] the what?
I had it on me this morning.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.268
How do they do that?
- No offense, ming.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.771
But you were never cut out
to be a ruthless despot.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.239
- Yeah, maybe this was
for the best.

06:47.241 --> 06:47.839
- It's not.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.342
Once I'm ousted, they might
send me away like becca,

06:50.344 --> 06:54.646
Or god forbid they send me
to the same place.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.214
I should probably keep
a low pro,

06:56.216 --> 06:59.684
Stay out
of the daylight.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.552
- Now, can we please talk

07:00.554 --> 07:02.954
About what's been on my
scrawling newsreel all morning?

07:02.956 --> 07:03.722
- And that is?
- Prom.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.591
Jake promised to make up for
his infamous sex van disastrophy

07:06.593 --> 07:07.626
By planning the perfect night,

07:07.628 --> 07:09.528
Which means
I need the perfect dress,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.196
Which is giving me
maj dress stress.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.197
I'm thinking
about going long

07:12.199 --> 07:14.633
'cause I've seen a lot of maxis
on the red c.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.534
- Red carpet.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.368
- But what if palos hillers

07:16.370 --> 07:17.436
Are fashion behind
and go mini?

07:17.438 --> 07:20.372
Maybe I'll just stick with short
to be safe.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.640
[gasps]
no.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.843
I'll go high-low.
Problem solved.

07:24.845 --> 07:25.911
Is matty gonna
ask you?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.179
- We've been getting
along well,

07:27.181 --> 07:28.847
But I don't
expect anything.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.783
- Why not?
- I don't wanna be let down.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.552
I finally earned
his friendship back.

07:33.554 --> 07:38.023
But a date to prom?
That's pushing it.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.659
And that's a wrap
on prom talk.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.159
- So prom.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.296
Guess who got here early and
bought the first two tickets.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.431
- Mm, so far, so good.
- [chuckles]

07:46.433 --> 07:51.069
- What do you guys think
it means to ask someone to prom?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.704
Basically like
a dtr, right?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.473
- Yeah, I guess.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.608
Maybe I had banked
enough good karma

07:56.610 --> 07:58.477
For a prom date,
and matty and I

07:58.479 --> 07:59.578
Were going to re-tr.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.080
- I agree,
dropping a hundie on tickets,

08:02.082 --> 08:04.649
Plus flowers, a limo,
a hotel--

08:04.651 --> 08:08.119
- Hotel?
- Maybe a hotel?

08:08.121 --> 08:08.920
Hotel.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.490
You don't really do that
unless you're into somebody.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.390
- That's what I thought.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.325
- Or you wanna get laid.
- Jake.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.894
- But that's not why I'm doing
it--I can get laid any time.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.662
- Or never again.
- Well, no, no.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.598
That's not what I meant.
I-I--

08:19.600 --> 08:21.333
[sighs]
I just wanna make it special,

08:21.335 --> 08:23.134
So you have a prom night
that you remember

08:23.136 --> 08:23.935
The rest of your life.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.403
- [gasps]
we're skipping fifth period.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.873
We have to pre-shop
before some skankazoid

08:27.875 --> 08:28.673
Nabs my perfect dress.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.775
- Suddenly, I had
dress stress too.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.544
If I was going to prom
with matty,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.346
I had to find
my perfect dress.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.715
- I know
what you're thinking about.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.816
- What?
- Valerie.

08:37.818 --> 08:41.019
You're still worried
about her.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.654
- Very worried.
And guilty.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.524
I had no right fantasizing
about a stupid dance

08:45.526 --> 08:47.158
When val was putting her life
on the line

08:47.160 --> 08:50.562
To keep reprobates in cheap
spirits and rolling papers.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.131
- I know I told you
to just let it go,

08:53.133 --> 08:54.933
But obviously you can't.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.168
Do something about it.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.137
- You're right.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.539
I can, and I will.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.842
If I had the power
to get valerie fired,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.810
Who was to say
I didn't have the power

09:05.812 --> 09:06.478
To get her rehired?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.346
Because you only know
one side of the story,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.315
Which isn't fair
because there are always

09:10.317 --> 09:11.249
Two sides
to every story,

09:11.251 --> 09:12.317
One of which
is the right one.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.485
- Can you please just
for one second--

09:13.487 --> 09:16.288
- Principal cox, are you aware
that we are living in america...

09:16.290 --> 09:17.322
- I had absolutely
no idea.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.524
- Where everyone deserves
the right to be heard.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.693
Valerie deserves the chance
to defend herself.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.528
I was the one
who wrote that essay,

09:23.530 --> 09:25.530
Which I now admit
was mean-spirited

09:25.532 --> 09:26.197
And totally biased.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.866
And I think she should get
her job back,

09:27.868 --> 09:29.334
So she should get
her job back--

09:29.336 --> 09:30.101
- Stop talking.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.504
- I can't, because I am not
gonna let you say no.

nah, nah, nah, nah, mm, neh.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.047
Mm.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.148
I wasn't going

is getting a hearing."

09:47.187 --> 09:48.219

09:48.221 --> 09:51.656
I was taking action, and I
was already seeing results.

09:51.658 --> 09:54.125

for tomorrow at 3:30.

09:54.127 --> 09:54.659
- Was scheduled?

09:54.661 --> 09:57.395
- I made the arrangements
this morning.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.297

20 minutes of my day

better to do with my time.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.844

10:45.846 --> 10:50.115
I don't know what to do
with myself.

10:50.117 --> 10:50.749
I have no purpose.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.552
- Though her situation wasn't
quite as dire as valerie's,

10:54.554 --> 10:57.022
To my mom,
it felt just as traumatic.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.225
And since I was already playing
goodwill ambassador,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.627
I felt obligated
to help her too.

that I am lost

11:21.548 --> 11:23.248

11:23.250 --> 11:24.449

11:24.451 --> 11:26.051

in this.

He'll think I knew
all along,

38:17.229 --> 38:18.395
And I don't wanna
jinx it.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.629

38:37.281 --> 38:39.449
I'm sorry,
were you about to go out?

38:39.451 --> 38:40.984
- Oh, this.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.719
Um, I was...

38:42.721 --> 38:47.023
- Jenna, are you ready
for the bar mitzvah?

38:47.025 --> 38:49.225
- Going to a bar mitzvah.

38:49.227 --> 38:50.026
Shalom.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.761
- At 10:00 at night?

at midnight,

The second
the kid turns 13.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.602
That crazy kid
just couldn't wait.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.539
Do you wanna sit down?

39:02.541 --> 39:05.542
- Yeah, I guess.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.550
- So...

39:13.552 --> 39:15.585
- So...
[sighs]

39:15.587 --> 39:18.321
So--

39:18.323 --> 39:20.357
Oh, I have never felt
this uncomfortable

39:20.359 --> 39:21.391
In your living room before.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.226
- Oh, come on.
It's just me.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.562
- Uh, I know.
That's why it's weird.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.197
- You're making it weird,
weirdo.

39:27.199 --> 39:30.800
- You're making it
weirder too.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.769
That's--okay,
how am I gonna do this?

39:32.771 --> 39:35.405
- Do what?

39:35.407 --> 39:37.307
- Okay.

39:37.309 --> 39:39.442
You're one
of my best friends.

39:39.444 --> 39:40.844
- And you're one of mine.

39:40.846 --> 39:44.180
- [laughs]

39:44.182 --> 39:44.848
This is ridiculous.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.750
I don't know
why I am being so formal.

39:46.752 --> 39:49.352
- Perhaps I had amassed
too much good karma.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.622
My prom proposition was starting
to sound like a proposal.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.858
- It's just--it's kinda strange
talking about it

39:54.860 --> 39:59.829
Because I just--
I feel like we're so beyond it.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.132
So...Prom.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.434
- Prom.
- Prom.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.335
[sighs]

40:05.337 --> 40:07.203
I know you saw
those tickets today.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.572
- I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.473
- Mm-hmm, you saw them,

40:10.475 --> 40:12.909
And then you pretended not to,
and you looked away.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.711
- You're right.

40:14.713 --> 40:15.612
I did do that,

40:15.614 --> 40:19.883
And I don't even
know why.

40:19.885 --> 40:22.786
- So are you going?

40:22.788 --> 40:24.788
- I hope so.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.990
Are you?

40:26.992 --> 40:27.791
- Yeah, I hope so too.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.326
- I had never seen matty
so anxious.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.929
All his nervous ticks
were in full force,

40:32.931 --> 40:34.230
And it was only
a matter of time

40:34.232 --> 40:37.167
Before he busted out
the armpit sniff.

40:37.169 --> 40:38.234
It was sweet.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.736
By all accounts,
he seemed worried

40:39.738 --> 40:42.105
I was going
to turn him down.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.507
- Anyway, prom.
That's--that's why I'm here.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.142
- All my life,
I had heard,

40:46.144 --> 40:49.846
"what goes around
comes around."

40:49.848 --> 40:50.713
- I just wanted
to make sure

40:50.715 --> 40:53.483
That you were cool with me
asking bailey.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.986
- And it had definitely
come back around.

- Have you finally gotten past
your hatred of me?

41:17.242 --> 41:19.742
- It's time for all of you
to reflect

41:19.744 --> 41:22.679
And write about who you want
to be.
