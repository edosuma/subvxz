WEBVTT

00:03.414 --> 00:05.614
How much will it hurt?

00:06.417 --> 00:07.683
It's just
a tiny skin sample.

00:07.685 --> 00:09.484
You saw me
do it to myself.

00:09.486 --> 00:12.421
On a scale of one to ten,
where one is a pebble

00:12.423 --> 00:15.324
in your shoe
and ten is the monkey

00:15.326 --> 00:18.126
you thought was your pet
biting your face off.

00:18.128 --> 00:19.828
A two.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.331
Eating a whole Altoid?

00:23.200 --> 00:24.266
Sheldon,

00:24.268 --> 00:25.968
if I'm gonna synthesize
a neural network

00:25.970 --> 00:27.903
from our skin cells,
I need to harvest them.

00:27.905 --> 00:30.472
Now, I've done this dozens
of times, but if you're

00:30.474 --> 00:32.006
too scared
you don't have to.

00:32.009 --> 00:33.875
No, this is for science.

00:33.877 --> 00:36.011
I can be brave
for science.

00:37.348 --> 00:39.314
Thank you.

00:39.316 --> 00:41.583
Oh, jiminy, that's cold!

00:41.585 --> 00:43.452
Just think how happy
you'll be in a few weeks

00:43.454 --> 00:44.820
when I've converted
our skin cells

00:44.822 --> 00:46.355
into functional
brain cells.

00:46.357 --> 00:50.058
All right, just warn me
before you do it.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.494
Okay.

00:52.496 --> 00:54.129
Three...

00:54.131 --> 00:55.797
two...
and we're done.

00:58.469 --> 01:00.302
You tricked me.

01:00.304 --> 01:01.903
You didn't say one.

01:01.905 --> 01:03.839
It didn't hurt, did it?
No...

01:03.841 --> 01:06.074
but “three, two and we're done”
is incomplete.

01:06.076 --> 01:08.010
You know those
things bother me.

01:08.012 --> 01:09.611
It's like hearing
“da-da-da-da-da-dah”

01:09.613 --> 01:10.646
without yelling...

01:10.648 --> 01:12.314
Okay, fine, one.

01:12.316 --> 01:13.982
Thank you.

01:13.984 --> 01:16.918
Now yell “Charge” and
we can get out of here.

(laughs)

01:58.965 --> 02:00.698
Hold on.

02:00.700 --> 02:01.733
Is that a wobble?

02:01.735 --> 02:03.267
Yes.

02:03.269 --> 02:05.837
That's definitely
a gravitational wobble.

02:05.839 --> 02:08.271
Uh, sorry,
I could come back.

02:08.274 --> 02:09.306
Oh, no, it's okay.

02:09.309 --> 02:10.374
I-I just found a wobble.

02:10.376 --> 02:12.777
Oh, do I need a mop?

02:13.580 --> 02:15.546
It's a gravitational wobble.

02:15.548 --> 02:17.715
It could be a sign
of an extrasolar planet

02:17.717 --> 02:20.184
that may contain life
and someday be named after me.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.520
Oh... well, if it has life,

02:22.522 --> 02:24.555
maybe it already has a name,
huh?

02:24.557 --> 02:26.190
Yeah, but it's probably
difficult to pronounce.

02:26.192 --> 02:27.458
What is your name?

02:27.460 --> 02:29.894
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

02:30.697 --> 02:32.063
You think it would be

02:32.065 --> 02:34.132
more difficult than that?

02:34.134 --> 02:36.000
Good point.

02:36.002 --> 02:37.001
And you are?

02:37.003 --> 02:39.604
Oh, uh, Issabella Maria
Concepcion.

02:39.606 --> 02:41.239
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

02:41.241 --> 02:42.440
Nice to meet you, too.

02:42.442 --> 02:44.041
You know, I have to say,

02:44.043 --> 02:45.510
based on the candy wrappers

02:45.512 --> 02:46.911
and the bags
of junk food I see

02:46.913 --> 02:48.379
in this trash,
I thought the person

02:48.381 --> 02:51.115
working here was ten years old.

02:51.117 --> 02:53.084
Oh, please, show me
a ten-year-old who knows

02:53.086 --> 02:55.586
to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

02:56.356 --> 02:57.889
<i>Bueno,</i> um, I'm just going

02:57.891 --> 02:58.956
to empty your waste paper basket

02:58.958 --> 03:00.158
and then I'll get
out of your way.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.826
Oh, please, allow me.

03:04.097 --> 03:07.498
That's a lot of empty calories.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.733
Thank you.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.067
You're welcome.

03:13.306 --> 03:15.506
Okay, uh, okay,

03:15.508 --> 03:16.874
I-I-I have to go.

03:16.876 --> 03:17.842
- Okay.
- Good luck

03:17.844 --> 03:20.678
with your, um,
space exploration.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.679
Thank you.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.281
Good luck with your...

03:23.283 --> 03:26.450
future endeavors.

03:29.122 --> 03:30.188
Did it work?

03:30.190 --> 03:32.023
Are they brain cells yet?

03:32.025 --> 03:33.624
If you'd give me a minute,
I'll tell you.

03:33.626 --> 03:35.760
Oh, just let me look.

03:35.762 --> 03:36.794
(gasps)

03:36.796 --> 03:38.196
Oh, my goodness!

03:38.198 --> 03:40.598
I see quivering black lines.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.133
Those must be neurons.

03:42.135 --> 03:44.535
Oh, they're so thick
and beautiful.

03:44.537 --> 03:46.437
Those are your
eyelashes, move.

03:50.243 --> 03:51.943
Well, Sheldon...

03:51.945 --> 03:54.278
I see astrocytes.

03:54.981 --> 03:56.830
Our combined skin cells are now

03:56.831 --> 03:58.263
a primitive neural network.

04:00.434 --> 04:03.368
I have such a profound

04:03.370 --> 04:04.770
sense of creation.

04:04.772 --> 04:05.838
I ju... it's like

04:05.840 --> 04:07.172
when I hatched Sea-Monkeys,

04:07.174 --> 04:09.575
except that this
is from my DNA,

04:09.577 --> 04:10.742
so this is like...

04:10.744 --> 04:12.644
Me-Monkeys.

04:14.115 --> 04:15.881
These cells come
from both of us.

04:15.883 --> 04:18.117
Yeah, but Us-Monkeys
doesn't pop.

04:18.119 --> 04:19.718
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!

04:19.720 --> 04:21.587
We-Monkeys, there you go.

04:21.589 --> 04:22.921
Hey.

04:22.923 --> 04:24.256
When can we start
running tests on it?

04:24.258 --> 04:26.325
No reason we can't
start right now.

04:26.327 --> 04:28.694
What stimulus should we
introduce it to first?

04:28.696 --> 04:30.529
L-Light, sound, temperature...

04:30.531 --> 04:32.231
Oh! Oh! Let's
expose it to images

04:32.233 --> 04:35.334
of me and you and see
who it likes better.

04:35.336 --> 04:38.637
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary
collection of neurons.

04:38.639 --> 04:39.671
I mean, it's remarkable,

04:39.673 --> 04:41.039
but it's still limited
in what it can do.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.274
I understand.

04:42.276 --> 04:44.676
She's the mean one,
I'm the fun one.

04:48.182 --> 04:51.617
Huh, they screwed up
and gave us steamed broccoli.

04:51.619 --> 04:52.417
Oh, no, that's mine.

04:52.419 --> 04:53.418
Really?

04:53.420 --> 04:54.653
The last green thing

04:54.655 --> 04:56.588
I saw you eat was a Skittle.

04:57.424 --> 04:58.524
Well, I can't eat

04:58.526 --> 04:59.558
like a ten-year-old
all the time.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.627
You're dating somebody,
who is it?

05:01.629 --> 05:02.694
What?

05:02.696 --> 05:04.329
What are you talking about?

05:04.331 --> 05:05.764
You only watch what you
eat when you're afraid

05:05.766 --> 05:07.499
you might have
to take your shirt off.

05:08.369 --> 05:09.868
No, she's right.

05:09.870 --> 05:10.969
As long as I've known you,

05:10.971 --> 05:12.404
you've always been
self-conscious

05:12.406 --> 05:14.173
about your cleavage.

05:15.142 --> 05:16.308
It's because you keep trying

05:16.310 --> 05:17.776
to stick pencils in it.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.847
All right, fine,
don't tell us.

05:21.849 --> 05:23.615
There's nothing to tell.

05:23.617 --> 05:25.817
All right.

05:29.657 --> 05:31.023
How's that broccoli?

05:31.025 --> 05:33.058
It's gross but I have to eat it
because I met somebody.

05:33.060 --> 05:33.825
Bam.

05:33.827 --> 05:35.027
Thank you.

05:35.029 --> 05:35.827
What's her name?

05:35.829 --> 05:36.828
Issabella.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.664
Oh, did you meet
her at work?

05:38.666 --> 05:41.533
Yes, in the telescope room.

05:41.535 --> 05:43.435
Oh, so she's an astronomer?

05:44.271 --> 05:46.138
Yes...

05:46.140 --> 05:48.473
which is why she was
in the telescope room.

05:48.475 --> 05:49.675
Yes, this is all making sense.

05:49.677 --> 05:50.943
Good.

05:50.945 --> 05:51.910
Well, that's great, Raj.

05:51.912 --> 05:53.212
You must have
so much in common.

05:53.214 --> 05:54.513
Mm-hmm.

05:54.515 --> 05:55.480
So, when do we meet her?

05:55.482 --> 05:57.282
No, no, this is brand-new.

05:57.284 --> 05:59.851
We haven't even been
on a proper date yet.

05:59.853 --> 06:02.454
Okay, well, good luck with it.
Thank you.

06:03.757 --> 06:05.857
How come you
never eat broccoli?

06:06.694 --> 06:07.726
I'm married,

06:07.728 --> 06:09.695
I don't have to be attractive.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.334
You know, most
people don't realize

06:15.336 --> 06:16.668
this technique has
actually been around

06:16.670 --> 06:18.370
for a few years.

06:18.372 --> 06:20.572
Still, I can't believe
you can turn ordinary skin cells

06:20.574 --> 06:22.207
into functioning brain cells.

06:22.209 --> 06:24.176
Well, I turned this one
into a functioning boyfriend,

06:24.178 --> 06:25.477
so sky's the limit.

06:27.581 --> 06:30.082
Look, look... here I am

06:30.084 --> 06:33.118
standing next
to the incubator.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.222
Uh, here is a microscopic
view of the cells.

06:37.224 --> 06:41.193
Look at that, put them in a tiny
Flash T-shirt and it's you.

06:41.195 --> 06:43.996
Oh.
Yeah, this little guy

06:43.998 --> 06:45.364
can already recognize

06:45.366 --> 06:47.099
electronically
transmitted images

06:47.101 --> 06:50.402
20% faster than any other
sample in Amy's lab.

06:51.238 --> 06:53.272
I'm running out of ways
to act excited.

06:55.509 --> 06:58.610
So, enough about us,
how are things going with you?

06:58.612 --> 07:00.379
Great, the doctor
said the baby's head

07:00.381 --> 07:01.580
is facing down now.

07:01.582 --> 07:03.015
Good, you know,

07:03.017 --> 07:05.684
in case the exit
isn't clearly marked.

07:05.686 --> 07:09.121
Yeah, I have to say,
it is nice to share

07:09.123 --> 07:12.257
this experience with someone
who's on the same journey.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.995
Although right now ours
is testing off the charts

07:16.997 --> 07:20.098
while yours is floating
around in its own waste.

07:21.535 --> 07:24.603
Are you actually comparing
my human baby

07:24.605 --> 07:27.105
to your brain in a bowl?

07:28.142 --> 07:29.474
Well, I didn't
make you waddle up

07:29.476 --> 07:31.810
four flights of stairs
for the heck of it.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.747
You do realize my baby
has functioning organs

07:35.749 --> 07:37.349
and can recognize voices.

07:37.351 --> 07:40.485
Yeah, but ours can recognize
a specific data stream

07:40.487 --> 07:42.387
among background noise.

07:43.157 --> 07:44.423
Mine has a fully developed

07:44.425 --> 07:45.490
immune system.

07:45.492 --> 07:46.558
Ours doesn't need

07:46.560 --> 07:48.093
an immune system
because it lives

07:48.095 --> 07:50.062
in a state-of-the-art
German incubator.

07:51.065 --> 07:52.030
Sheldon, that's enough.

07:52.032 --> 07:53.432
Oh, yeah, no, fine.

07:53.434 --> 07:55.267
Let's just agree
that both creations

07:55.269 --> 07:56.935
are special in their own way

07:56.937 --> 07:59.371
and it is foolish
to try and compare them.

07:59.373 --> 08:01.073
Although, we didn't need
to have sex with Howard

08:01.075 --> 08:02.407
for ours, so we win.

08:06.046 --> 08:07.846
KOOTHRAPPALI:
This is fun.

08:10.884 --> 08:13.552
I have never cleaned
a toilet before.

08:13.554 --> 08:14.586
You're kidding.

08:14.588 --> 08:16.188
No, I grew up with a house
full of servants

08:16.190 --> 08:17.689
and now I have
a cleaning lady...

08:18.359 --> 08:19.758
...who is a lovely woman

08:19.760 --> 08:21.660
who I have great respect for.

08:21.662 --> 08:25.464
It's okay, you're allowed
to have a cleaning lady.

08:25.466 --> 08:26.965
Oh, good, because
she also walks my dog,

08:26.967 --> 08:29.434
buys my groceries
and cuts my hair.

08:30.270 --> 08:32.270
I think that's called a mommy.

08:33.573 --> 08:34.972
Uh...

08:35.808 --> 08:37.241
So, forgive me...

08:37.244 --> 08:38.543
forgive me for being nosy,

08:38.544 --> 08:39.910
but is-is there a wedding ring

08:39.913 --> 08:41.880
under those pretty
rubber gloves?

08:43.317 --> 08:45.550
No, not for many years.

08:45.552 --> 08:48.186
Oh, so, you are unencumbered?

08:48.188 --> 08:49.221
Just me and my son.

08:49.223 --> 08:51.123
I love kids,
how old is he?

08:51.125 --> 08:53.291
Nineteen.

08:54.428 --> 08:57.329
That's a cute age.

08:57.331 --> 09:00.031
They can do so many things.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.733
He's studying to be

09:01.735 --> 09:03.468
a lawyer at UCLA.

09:03.470 --> 09:04.669
That's wonderful.

09:04.671 --> 09:06.838
A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.874
Look at that,
we have something in common.

09:08.876 --> 09:10.675
Yeah, I guess we do.

09:10.677 --> 09:13.845
Maybe there are other things
we have in common.

09:13.847 --> 09:17.783
C-Come dinnertime,
do you enjoy eating food?

09:17.785 --> 09:20.485
<i>Ay,</i> Rajesh,

09:20.487 --> 09:22.788
I think you're very sweet,
but (sighs)

09:22.790 --> 09:25.991
I work two jobs and I don't
have time for dating.

09:25.993 --> 09:27.826
Yeah, sure. I understand.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.394
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

09:29.396 --> 09:31.163
Oh, please don't take it
personal,

09:31.165 --> 09:32.998
I think you're a very nice man.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.767
I think you're very nice
as well.

09:35.769 --> 09:37.636
Thank you for helping me.

09:37.638 --> 09:39.237
Good night, Rajesh.

09:39.239 --> 09:41.239
Oh, yes. Oh, okay.

09:41.241 --> 09:42.974
Uh...

09:42.976 --> 09:44.443
Good night.

09:49.283 --> 09:50.449
I don't know,

09:50.451 --> 09:53.652
maybe it's the fumes
from the urinal cakes,

09:53.654 --> 09:56.555
but I feel like something
is happening between us.

09:56.557 --> 09:59.057
(chuckles)
Good night, Rajesh.

09:59.893 --> 10:01.626
Okay. I'll leave.

10:01.628 --> 10:03.962
But just know,
every time I come in here,

10:03.964 --> 10:05.464
I'll be thinking of you.

10:11.805 --> 10:13.205
Would you look at that?

10:13.207 --> 10:16.241
The image we gave it
was 45% white noise,

10:16.243 --> 10:18.143
and it still managed
to reconstruct it.

10:18.145 --> 10:20.078
I've never seen results
like this before.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.947
Yeah, we need to stop for
magnets on the way home;

10:21.949 --> 10:24.416
this is going right
on the fridge.

10:24.418 --> 10:26.451
Aren't you glad you
participated in this?

10:26.453 --> 10:27.752
Oh, I am.

10:27.754 --> 10:29.855
And you realize
what the next step is?

10:29.857 --> 10:31.623
(sighs) Set up
a second culture

10:31.625 --> 10:33.625
and try to replicate
our results.

10:33.627 --> 10:35.460
Uh, no.

10:35.462 --> 10:37.062
We lock that door,

10:37.064 --> 10:39.798
lower our underpants
a little and make a baby.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.074

10:52.177 --> 10:55.111
Make a baby?
What are you talking about?

10:55.113 --> 10:58.615
Clearly the combination
of our DNA is exceptional.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.984
Eh... Our child could be
the next step

11:00.986 --> 11:02.686
in the evolution of mankind.

11:02.688 --> 11:05.622
We... we'll be able to get
into any preschool we want!

11:05.624 --> 11:08.325
Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready
to have a baby.

11:08.327 --> 11:10.861
Oh, yes, you are!
I track your cycle.

11:11.997 --> 11:14.197
For the next 36 hours
you're as fertile

11:14.199 --> 11:17.267
as a manure-covered wheat field.

11:18.437 --> 11:20.770
Wow. I-I can actually feel

11:20.772 --> 11:23.740
the egg crawling its way
back up.

11:25.377 --> 11:26.877
I don't understand.

11:26.879 --> 11:29.346
I thought you'd be thrilled
to procreate with me.

11:29.348 --> 11:31.047
Not right now.
Oh,

11:31.049 --> 11:32.816
I see what's happening here.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.952
You're playing hard to get.

11:35.954 --> 11:38.288
I'm not playing anything.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.290
We're not making a baby today.

11:40.292 --> 11:42.492
Very well.

11:44.963 --> 11:46.963
Oops, how clumsy of me.

11:46.965 --> 11:49.366
You know what? Let me get that.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.477
Hey.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.711
Where are you going?

12:01.713 --> 12:03.346
I...

12:03.348 --> 12:06.049
Did you even look at my bottom?

12:10.289 --> 12:11.821
Welcome.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.825
- What is this?
- Oh, well,

12:15.827 --> 12:18.261
you said you didn't have time to
go out for dinner, so I thought

12:18.263 --> 12:19.796
we could have one right here.

12:19.798 --> 12:22.332
Oh, Rajesh...
Oh, come on!

12:22.334 --> 12:23.466
We're in the telescope room!

12:23.468 --> 12:26.002
It'll be like dining
under the stars.

12:26.004 --> 12:27.604
Y-You see this, uh, double zero?

12:27.606 --> 12:31.141
When it says “01,”
that means it's twinkling.

12:36.782 --> 12:39.816
Sometimes it takes a while.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.552
Rajesh, this is so sweet,

12:42.554 --> 12:44.487
but you... you know I'm working.

12:44.489 --> 12:45.989
That's why I already
cleaned up in here

12:45.991 --> 12:47.657
and all the other rooms
in the hall.

12:50.495 --> 12:53.029
Well, I suppose that gives me
a little time.

12:53.031 --> 12:54.564
Oh, please sit!
(chuckles)

12:54.566 --> 12:58.034
I tried to cook you
a meal from your homeland.

12:58.036 --> 12:59.169
Oh, really?

12:59.171 --> 13:01.204
You made Cuban food?

13:02.274 --> 13:06.209
That depends-- do they have
Mexican food in Cuba?

13:09.147 --> 13:11.548
Now, when he said “make a baby”"

13:11.550 --> 13:15.051
is it possible he
meant out of Legos?

13:16.154 --> 13:17.854
No. He was explicit.

13:17.856 --> 13:20.824
Needlessly
and freakishly explicit.

13:22.361 --> 13:23.994
LEONARD:
Why does he need a baby?

13:23.996 --> 13:27.063
He's already hairless
and smells like talcum powder.

13:28.033 --> 13:30.300
Could you two really
have some sort of

13:30.302 --> 13:32.068
super-intelligent child?

13:32.070 --> 13:33.703
Well, there is
a genetic component,

13:33.705 --> 13:35.438
but that doesn't
guarantee anything.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.873
That's true.
Sheldon's father

13:36.875 --> 13:39.776
once picked a fight
with a cactus.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.778
Yeah, but that's
just his Earth parents.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.881
We don't know anything about
the ones that sent him here.

13:46.551 --> 13:49.753
LEONARD: Well, we know they were
smart enough to send him away.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.223
Hey, you're talking
about the person I love

13:53.225 --> 13:57.027
and have been avoiding
for the past three hours.

13:57.029 --> 13:59.229
Aw, man.

14:00.198 --> 14:01.431
PENNY:
Ooh!

14:01.433 --> 14:03.700
Sheldon gonna get some.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.203
Well, have fun with
whatever nightmare's

14:07.205 --> 14:09.439
behind door number two.

14:09.441 --> 14:11.174
(Leonard chuckling)

14:15.113 --> 14:17.313
(jazz music playing)

14:26.958 --> 14:29.025
Well, hello.

14:29.861 --> 14:32.295
Hello.

14:32.297 --> 14:34.531
Would you care for a brandy?

14:34.533 --> 14:35.865
I don't think so.

14:35.867 --> 14:38.702
Good choice, it's disgusting.

14:39.538 --> 14:43.506
Sheldon, please stop
trying to seduce me.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.774
Who's trying to seduce you?

14:44.776 --> 14:47.377
After a long day I always
turn on smooth jazz

14:47.379 --> 14:51.915
and spray deer musk
on my inner thighs.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.520
I thought it smelled
like a petting zoo in here.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.290
Anything you'd like to pet?

15:00.292 --> 15:03.693
Not my hair. There's
a lot of goop in it.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.429
Okay, I've had enough.

15:06.431 --> 15:07.597
(stammers)

15:07.599 --> 15:08.932
Amy, come back.

15:08.934 --> 15:11.434
I don't know
how to open the oysters.

15:13.905 --> 15:16.506
So, um, what
surprised you the most

15:16.508 --> 15:18.208
when you first
came to America?

15:18.210 --> 15:21.578
Well, I suppose
how much people care

15:21.580 --> 15:24.380
about Oprah's favorite things.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.915
I thought that, too.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.550
But then I got
my first waffle maker

15:27.552 --> 15:29.385
and never questioned her again.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.020
You know,

15:31.022 --> 15:33.590
I do have some time off
this Sunday

15:33.592 --> 15:35.325
if you'd like to...
WOLOWITZ: Hey! I saw your car...

15:35.327 --> 15:38.161
Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting?

15:38.163 --> 15:38.975
Uh...

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
It's okay.
Uh, I should get back to work.

15:41.299 --> 15:42.799
Hi. Howard Wolowitz.

15:42.801 --> 15:44.267
Oh. Issabella Concepcion.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.269
Oh, yeah, the astronomer.

15:46.271 --> 15:47.904
Raj told us
about you.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.407
Hey! Free toilet paper!

15:53.411 --> 15:56.479
You told him
I was an astronomer?

15:56.481 --> 15:57.580
Uh...

15:57.582 --> 15:58.715
I understand.

15:58.717 --> 16:00.316
Time to go.
No, p-please don't.

16:00.318 --> 16:02.285
It's okay, Rajesh,
I'm a grown woman.

16:02.287 --> 16:03.586
I don't have to waste my time

16:03.588 --> 16:05.421
with someone
who's embarrassed by me.

16:09.494 --> 16:11.327
I can keep this, right?

16:11.329 --> 16:13.563
Issabella!

16:13.565 --> 16:15.064
Issabella, wait,
wait, let me explain.

16:15.066 --> 16:17.567
If you are embarrassed
by what I do,

16:17.569 --> 16:19.836
why did you pursue me?
I'm sorry.

16:19.838 --> 16:22.705
Honestly, I-I didn't think
your job would bother me,

16:22.707 --> 16:24.040
but I guess it did.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.742
And I hate myself for that.

16:25.744 --> 16:27.210
But there's
a lot of things

16:27.212 --> 16:29.279
about me that would
totally embarrass you.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.580
I doubt that.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.482
Well, prepare to be mortified.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.652
I let my dog eat food out
of my mouth,

16:35.654 --> 16:38.321
not because she likes it
but because I do.

16:38.323 --> 16:42.492
Also, I know they're pretty,
but I'm scared of butterflies.

16:42.494 --> 16:44.427
Sorry, just
passing through.

16:44.429 --> 16:46.596
I think this fell off your cart.

16:49.267 --> 16:50.867
Come on. What do you say?

16:50.869 --> 16:52.502
Let me make it up to you.

16:52.504 --> 16:54.804
You're very persistent.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.307
It's my one move.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.375
Okay.

17:00.345 --> 17:02.178
This Sunday night,
you may take me to dinner

17:02.180 --> 17:03.446
at a nice restaurant.

17:03.448 --> 17:05.949
Great.
Where would you like to go?

17:05.951 --> 17:07.150
Your choice.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.519
It can be Pakistani food,
if you like.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.154
Excuse me, but I'm Indian.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.323
And now you know how it feels.

17:23.549 --> 17:26.215
So, were you turned
on even a little bit?

17:26.218 --> 17:27.284
It was like

17:27.286 --> 17:30.654
being hit on
by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.324
I'm sorry, is that a yes?

17:34.326 --> 17:36.360
No!

17:36.362 --> 17:37.961
Amy,

17:37.963 --> 17:40.497
I didn't want it
to come to this.

17:40.499 --> 17:42.366
But you have left me no choice

17:42.368 --> 17:44.301
but to employ
the most passionate,

17:44.303 --> 17:46.870
seductive dance known to man.

17:46.872 --> 17:49.506
(Spanish music playing)

17:49.508 --> 17:52.242
The flamenco.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.317
(snapping, slapping continues)

18:07.693 --> 18:08.759
For God's sake,

18:08.761 --> 18:10.928
you're ridiculous.

18:14.153 --> 18:17.621
You guys are aroused, right?

18:19.525 --> 18:21.425
(pants)
That was a close one.
