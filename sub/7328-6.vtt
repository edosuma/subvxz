WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:11.745
Micki.

00:11.779 --> 00:12.780
Hey, Sara.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.215
How are you?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.449
Look at you.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.518
I missed you
at the Parents' Potluck.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.387
Oh, Becca had a dance recital.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.554
Oh, your turn
for snack?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.256
My turn for snack.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.291
Can you believe this?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.358
If he would concentrate

00:24.392 --> 00:26.460
a little less on snacking,
a little more on the game,

00:26.494 --> 00:29.097
we wouldn't be O and four,
but...

00:29.130 --> 00:29.763
Oh, your cart.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.132
Isn't that your SUV?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.833
Oh. Well,
what's another ding?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.635
See you at practice.

00:44.445 --> 00:49.283
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:49.317 --> 00:53.721
and CBS

01:37.631 --> 01:39.567
Hey.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.670
Where the hell
are you going?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.210
Gibbs.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.145
Oh, you must be Gibbs.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.214
Fornells mentioned you.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.548
Did he?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.684
Mm-hmm. Agent Lina Reyes, FBI.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.319
Your driver
has a lead foot.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.255
Well, we tend to hurry
when we suspect terrorism.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.756
Well, so do we
when the target's

02:02.790 --> 02:04.325
a naval aviator,
Agent Reyes.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.394
Lieutenant Commander
Micki Shields.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.895
She bombed
civilians

02:07.928 --> 02:09.129
in Afghanistan.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.431
Accidentally. Article 32 hearing
cleared her of all charges.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.732
Yeah. By us.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.934
Not the psychos overseas
issuing jihadist threats

02:13.967 --> 02:15.936
against her and her family.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.574
Have you spoken
to your director?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.543
I did.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.877
Good. Then we're clear.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.879
FBI handles
the investigation,

02:25.913 --> 02:31.452
NCIS protects
the intended target.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.389
We want copies
of everything you find.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.461
Kate, check with
Commander Shields.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.463
Track down the rest
of her family.
On it.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.532
DiNozzo, secure her home.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.467
I want a full
surveillance perimeter.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.469
McGee, coordinate

02:48.502 --> 02:50.238
all feeds with MTAC.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.405
All right, boss.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.907
Oh, sounds like we're going
to need the infrared scope

02:53.941 --> 02:55.443
on this one, McGee.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.945
The one that can see
through walls at night?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.481
Better than pay-TV,
and, the best part,

03:00.514 --> 03:01.215
it's free.

03:01.249 --> 03:01.949
And that's
the reason why, Tony.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.484
Why what, Kate?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.453
You'll never get
my home address.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.921
COMMANDER SHIELDS:
I'm okay, Jen, I promise you.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.623
Look. See?

03:09.657 --> 03:13.727
I got worse scrapes in
ejection-seat training.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.896
Honestly, honey,
I'm fine.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.598
I got to go.
I'll see you soon.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.634
I'm going to make you
cha-cha chicken for dinner,

03:20.668 --> 03:22.570
okay? Okay.

03:22.603 --> 03:28.576
NCIS. So I take it
this wasn't an accident?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.544
We're not jumping
to any conclusions,

03:30.578 --> 03:32.513
but considering all
the recent threats...

03:32.546 --> 03:35.483
I thought I left
that war behind me.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.618
My kids could have been
in that car.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.856
One mistake.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.360
One horrible
mistake.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.561
I read the report.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.997
What happened in Afghanistan
wasn't your fault.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.865
Yeah, right or wrong,
it's still something

03:51.899 --> 03:53.701
I have to live with.
And fog of war

03:53.734 --> 03:55.035
just doesn't cut it

03:55.068 --> 03:57.037
when you're looking
at ten dead civilians.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.606
Micki!

03:58.639 --> 03:59.607
Aw, honey.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.041
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.576
Yeah. I'm fine, sweetheart.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.977
Thank God.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.646
You'd never think
you'd be happy

04:05.679 --> 04:09.650
you ran into Sara Turcott
in a parking lot!

04:09.683 --> 04:12.420
So... So, what,
do we know who did this?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.655
Not yet, Mr. Shields.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.290
Okay, so what,
they can try it again?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.825
Well, if they do,
we'll stop them.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.394
NCIS will be providing
protection for your family.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.497
Too bad you weren't
around to save Libby.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.899
Are you kidding?
Libby?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.067
Who's Libby?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.369
Oh, our dog, Agent Todd.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.670
A nasty
little thing,

04:29.703 --> 04:31.505
but the kids
loved her.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.511
GIBBS:
I'll need copies of
the surveillance tapes

04:37.545 --> 04:38.979
from the
security camera.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.314
You'll get them.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.782
Today.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.652
I'll see what I can do.

04:44.685 --> 04:48.522
You know what "terminal
leave" is, Agent Reyes?
No.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.924
That's what Commander
Shields is on.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.661
In four days
she'll be a civilian,

04:53.694 --> 04:55.663
which means I won't be
around to protect her.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.931
That's how long you have
to solve this case.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.534
You're giving me a deadline?

05:02.670 --> 05:05.739
Don't screw up.

05:16.049 --> 05:16.984
I see something.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.486
You see speckling, Gibbs.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.355
No. I see a guy planting a bomb

05:21.389 --> 05:22.956
under her SUV.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.958
Do you know how many times
this has been taped over?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.060
The VCR heads have scraped it
down to the plastic.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.062
And let's not forget--
taken through a lens

05:29.096 --> 05:30.831
that's caked with years
of bird droppings.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.032
I think you can
make a positive ID.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.901
I'll try Starwitness.

05:33.934 --> 05:34.902
What's that?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.437
It's an enhancement program.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.407
Do a little
homomorphic filtering...

05:39.440 --> 05:40.674
deinterlacing...

05:40.708 --> 05:44.011
algorithmic enhancement...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.846
unsharp masking.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.418
Yeah. We're getting
somewhere now.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.786
I am. Straight
into a brick wall.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.122
Whoever it is,
he's blocked by the vehicle.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.991
No. The reflection.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.060
What reflection?

06:00.093 --> 06:03.697
Abbs, look at the finish
on the car next to it.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.433
You're serious.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.100
Abbs, look at the door panel.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.902
Dark and shiny.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.706
You can see a reflection.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.076
A reflection of whoever
planted the bomb.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.079
Gibbs... you're hired!

06:19.112 --> 06:21.815
DUCKY:
When you walked into a room,

06:21.849 --> 06:24.151
I bet you must
have turned heads.

06:24.184 --> 06:28.121
Just back from the salon,
with your hair all done up.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.823
Doctor, I'm looking

06:29.857 --> 06:31.425
at a blood type they sent over.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.093
It doesn't match
Lieutenant Commander Shields.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.462
Is that so?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.430
Yeah. They said
the only one

06:36.464 --> 06:38.699
injured in the explosion
was Shields.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.967
They did indeed.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.436
There's someone unaccounted for.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.937
Mr. Palmer,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.906
what I'm about to show you
may force you

06:45.939 --> 06:48.476
to reevaluate your theory.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.947
French-fried poodle.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.816
The family pet.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.653
Who was, tragically,
inside the car.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.455
I can just see

07:01.489 --> 07:04.157
those FBI forensic weasels

07:04.191 --> 07:05.626
sitting around,
laughing,

07:05.659 --> 07:06.894
picturing what

07:06.927 --> 07:08.128
I'm going to look like
performing

07:08.161 --> 07:11.031
a forensic autopsy
on this poor creature.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.500
What are you going to do?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
Oh, let them laugh.

07:14.001 --> 07:19.006
Alexander the Great had a dog--
a mastiff named... Peritas.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.509
Yeah. Nobody
laughed about her.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.245
When she died,
he led the funeral procession.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.548
Built monuments to her.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.716
Ordered yearly

07:28.749 --> 07:31.852
celebrations
in her memory.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.153
Yeah. When I was
a kid, I used

07:33.186 --> 07:34.955
to bury our pets
under our porch

07:34.988 --> 07:36.123
till my mom found out.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.257
She was pretty upset.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.493
They didn't want you
to bury your pets?

07:39.527 --> 07:40.393
No. We lived on

07:40.427 --> 07:42.563
the tenth floor
of an apartment building.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.899
Right.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.234
Ah.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.069
What is it, Doctor?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.203
Do you see that?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.672
I'm going
to take a look.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.910
Just open this up...

08:05.085 --> 08:07.087
Get that up to Abby.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.861
Oh, you poor thing.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.798
This would never
have happened to Peritas.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.568
GIBBS:
I would like for everyone

08:20.601 --> 08:22.536
to go about
their normal lives

08:22.570 --> 08:23.937
as much as possible.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.272
McGee?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.240
McGee, systems check.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.877
Hey!

08:29.910 --> 08:32.045
Okay, camera one is up.
Camera two and three,

08:32.079 --> 08:34.081
give me infrared,
full spectrum sweep.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.282
Number two.
Camera three.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.717
Okay, punch up camera four.
Camera four to go.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.085
We're up and operational, Tony.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.086
Boss.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.288
We will try
to keep a low profile,

08:41.321 --> 08:43.156
but we need
your cooperation.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.793
You see anything suspicious,

08:45.826 --> 08:47.795
you tell us.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.129
I don't believe this.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.798
Can I sleep at Amy's house?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.100
Not a good idea.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.201
We'll need advance notice
to clear it.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.536
( sighs )

09:00.741 --> 09:03.143
It's all been
kind of stressful.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.545
I'm outta here.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.917
It's an expression.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.652
Bed.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.287
Hey, listen. Um...

09:14.321 --> 09:17.991
You and me, we're kinda
going to be hanging.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.160
You are kidding.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.896
It's gonna be great.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.032
It already sucks.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.034
Hey, yeah.

09:27.067 --> 09:34.041
I remember how I felt
when my dog died, Willy.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.644
Bite me.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.079
( growls )

09:40.380 --> 09:43.216
Well, I guess
we'll turn in, too.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.020
It's been kind of stressful.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.056
Good night.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.159
Good night.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.827
I'll take the front door.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.663
Then I demand
to take the rear.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.664
Tony...

09:56.697 --> 09:57.898
Yes, Kate, dear?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.366
There's only
one bathroom downstairs.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.367
And your point is?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.735
The seat stays down.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.736
Unless it's up.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.738
( cell phone rings )

10:06.006 --> 10:07.107
Yeah. Gibbs.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.009
The item Ducky retrieved
from the dog--

10:09.042 --> 10:11.044
I put it through
X-ray chromatography.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.646
There's traces of C-4.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.848
It was a bomb.

10:14.882 --> 10:15.816
Yeah. Also the presence
of mercury

10:15.849 --> 10:18.752
used as a vibration trigger.
It's the exact

10:18.786 --> 10:20.754
same chemical signature
as the bomb that killed

10:20.788 --> 10:22.990
that naval attache
in Morocco last month.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.291
You're dealing with...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.760
Al Qaeda assassination team.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.271
KATE:
* Sexy as I wanna be

10:38.305 --> 10:41.174
* Got these fellas chasing me

10:41.208 --> 10:43.176
* Let's go with
this freak show *

10:43.210 --> 10:44.712
* Outrageous

10:44.745 --> 10:45.713
* Wanna move my body

10:45.746 --> 10:46.346
* Outrageous

10:46.379 --> 10:47.881
* When I'm at a party

10:47.915 --> 10:48.882
* Outrageous...
* Outrageous...

10:51.318 --> 10:52.085
Tony!

10:52.119 --> 10:54.187
Out of here. Now!

10:54.221 --> 10:56.089
What? I'm just
brushing my teeth.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.290
Oh, hey, don't use
up the hot water

10:57.324 --> 10:59.292
"cause you've been
in there forever.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.294
Tony, how long have
you been in here?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.931
Long enough to know
you can't sing...

11:03.964 --> 11:06.133
and haven't shaved
your legs in a week.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.171
( laughing )

11:12.740 --> 11:13.874
Outrageous.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.375
( growls )

11:16.977 --> 11:19.279
FBI AGENT REYES:
The bomb was C-Four.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.447
Mercury detonator.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.149
Shaped charge.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.184
We ran the identifying taggants
on it,

11:24.217 --> 11:25.452
and it turns out that it...

11:25.485 --> 11:27.287
Stolen from a military
base in Kuwait.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.289
And how do you know that?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.291
Our French poodle told me.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.261
You... It's linked to
Al Qaeda units overseas.

11:34.294 --> 11:38.098
We've identified three
individuals in the country

11:38.131 --> 11:41.301
who may have links
to their cells.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.137
Do you know how to use this?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.276
Sure.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.082
You have no idea what
that is, do you?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.416
Not really.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.787
Didn't figure you

11:59.820 --> 12:01.421
for a tech type, Gibbs.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.423
( blipping )

12:04.424 --> 12:05.258
( beep )

12:06.526 --> 12:08.962
REYES:
Khalid Hasan.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.965
Suspected in planning three
bombings in North Africa.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.501
He was spotted by a Virginia
traffic control camera

12:14.534 --> 12:16.269
in D.C. last week.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.304
REYES:
Roland Al...

12:17.337 --> 12:18.939
GIBBS:
Roland Alan Moore.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.308
Former Petty Officer.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.409
Medically discharged

12:22.442 --> 12:24.878
when he lost two fingers
in an engine room accident.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.447
Put in jail for bombing
a recruiting office.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.282
Converted to Islam in prison.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.052
And escaped a work detail
three months ago.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.921
Well, our computer geeks
suspect that

12:33.954 --> 12:36.323
he is one of the people
posting threats to

12:36.356 --> 12:38.425
Commander Shields on
the Islamic Web sites.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.726
Fernando Patroya.

12:39.759 --> 12:45.365
He owns five ice cream
parlors in Montgomery
and Charles County.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.334
We believe they are
money-laundering

12:47.367 --> 12:49.803
fronts for Al Qaeda linked
to the Philippines.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.471
What's his connection with
Lieutenant Commander Shields?

12:51.504 --> 12:53.841
Well, he was sighted in the
vicinity of the bombing

12:53.874 --> 12:55.909
ten days ago and may could
just be a coincidence.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.245
Okay, bring him in
for questioning.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.346
I can't do that.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.281
If I do, it will tip him off
that we're on to him,

13:01.314 --> 13:02.549
and we are hoping
that he will lead us

13:02.582 --> 13:04.217
to some of his contacts
in the States.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.186
While you are hoping,
I have a Navy family

13:06.219 --> 13:07.855
living in fear
they'll be executed

13:07.888 --> 13:09.056
on the way to the Mall.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.058
If we bring him in,
all we're gonna get

13:11.091 --> 13:13.060
is his name and some
B.S. cover story.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.930
Not if you put him
in a room with me.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.431
It's not gonna happen.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.335
Sorry.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.242
Hey, don't forget your, uh,
your thingamagig stick..

13:29.276 --> 13:32.545
Hold on. It needs to be
dis...connected first.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.549
You did that on purpose.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.131
LYLE:
I don't believe this.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.265
I bought tickets.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.600
It's Green Day!

13:53.633 --> 13:54.767
You're acting like
it's my fault.

13:54.801 --> 13:58.405
Just tell me, are you going
with me or not? Yes or no.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.974
What's it gonna be, Jen?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.843
Lyle... don't.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.449
Half the school's
not here today.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.418
Is that so?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.987
Because of you.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.025
( school bell ringing )

14:18.058 --> 14:19.192
Thanks.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.532
Make sure that all of you
have your, uh...

14:25.565 --> 14:27.100
( sighing )

14:32.239 --> 14:36.276
Twenty-four... fourteen... two.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.011
No.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.581
Twenty-two...

14:41.614 --> 14:44.952
fourteen...

14:44.985 --> 14:46.386
twenty.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.420
No.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.026
Where are you going?
Bathroom.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.931
Why, you want
to watch me pee,
Special Agent Todd?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.102
( sighing )

15:09.542 --> 15:11.578
( tinkling )

15:11.611 --> 15:14.381
You had to go really bad, huh?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.116
( Jennifer exhaling )

15:18.151 --> 15:20.653
My parents told me
you had to follow me around.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.990
Doesn't mean that
I have to talk to you.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.128
Do your parents know
that you smoke?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.129
( exhaling )

15:29.162 --> 15:30.297
No.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.032
Well, you going to tell them?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.668
Hmm...

15:39.039 --> 15:42.175
Not if you promise to quit.

15:42.209 --> 15:42.976
Whatever.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.447
You know, you should
be flattered.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.449
I used to protect the President.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.218
Of what?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.120
The United States.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.089
Really? And now
you're protecting me.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.424
And your whole family.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.126
( scoffing ):
What a waste.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.267
Might be four people...
but it's not a family.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.070
It hasn't been in a long time.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.141
( school bell ringing )

16:14.174 --> 16:15.675
WILLY:
Ever shot anybody?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.077
Not this week.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.145
You strapped in?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.146
Hey!

16:19.179 --> 16:20.147
WILLY:
Oh, a Sig!

16:20.180 --> 16:21.314
Dude, you got a Sig.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.050
Dude's got a Sig.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.417
Want to help me warm up?

16:24.451 --> 16:26.253
Yeah. What do you
want me to do?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.021
Just, uh, stand there
and don't move.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.622
TONY:
Okay. I can do that.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.159
TONY:
All right.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.460
Don't move.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.561
I'm good at that.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.097
Goal!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.131
Huh, ha, ha.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.100
Hey, touch me, it's child abuse.

16:41.068 --> 16:41.734
( growling )

16:41.768 --> 16:42.469
All right,
let's go, guys.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.605
MAN:
Watch out, guys!

16:45.638 --> 16:47.174
WILLY:
Shoot it!
Shoot it!

16:47.207 --> 16:48.041
BOY:
Nice shot!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.076
Yeah!

16:49.109 --> 16:50.377
GREG:
It's just plain stupid.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.744
Oh, okay, here we go.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.146
He's getting better, actually.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.116
It doesn't matter how
good he is if he can't
reach the damn ball!

16:56.149 --> 16:57.184
Why's the coach
keep playing him?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.118
'Cause he's the coach's kid.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.053
I agree with you,
we need a new keeper.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.054
Honey.
I mean, look at...

17:01.088 --> 17:02.189
They're kids,
okay, you know?

17:02.222 --> 17:03.323
It's supposed to be fun.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.825
Winning is fun, honey, trust me.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.095
Well, it isn't everything,
Micki.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.097
Well, it should be.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.264
Come on, Greta. Let's, uh,

17:11.298 --> 17:12.399
let's go set up the snacks

17:12.432 --> 17:14.501
while our spouses pretend
they're watching the Olympics.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.169
WOMAN:
B-Bye.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.604
I want double overtime
for this, Boss.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.671
That kid's a nightmare.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.340
He reminds me of you.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.575
WILLY:
Yeah!

17:22.609 --> 17:23.443
( grunting )

17:24.244 --> 17:25.412
TONY:
Oh, ho, ho!

17:25.445 --> 17:27.680
No goal! No goal.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.716
TONY:
Sorry about that!

17:33.786 --> 17:35.355
Sorry.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.556
Sorry!

17:39.226 --> 17:42.229
( engine sputtering )

17:44.164 --> 17:45.632
What's up?

17:47.467 --> 17:51.504
I don't know. Something
doesn't feel right.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.349
( weapon firing )

18:04.251 --> 18:05.218
He's good.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.787
Told you I knew someone
who could beat you.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.190
McGEE:
Not sure about this, DiNozzo.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.524
TONY:
Keep the faith, McGee.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.592
You're winning.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.726
Playing Unreal Tournament
in the Multiple Threat

18:13.760 --> 18:16.196
Assessment Center is not
what they had in mind when....

18:16.229 --> 18:17.264
Focus, Probie.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.598
D-ohh!

18:18.631 --> 18:21.168
If Gibbs sees me playing this...

18:23.236 --> 18:23.703
GIBBS:
Hey.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.804
McGee.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.406
Yeah, boss?

18:28.908 --> 18:31.344
Status report.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.548
Yes! Ha-ha!

18:35.582 --> 18:36.683
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

18:36.716 --> 18:38.351
Whoo!

18:38.385 --> 18:40.220
McGee.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.256
Uh... girl is-is in her room.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.492
Um, her parents are-are
in the kitchen with Kate,

18:45.525 --> 18:49.396
and, uh, I-I guess you
know where the boy is.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.632
Yup.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.834
( sighing )

18:54.867 --> 18:56.303
Won't happen again.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.473
I know.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.776
( sighing )

19:03.810 --> 19:06.346
( muttering ):
Twenty-one... four...

19:06.379 --> 19:08.615
two!

19:08.648 --> 19:10.783
Twenty-two, fourteen,
twenty-two!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.419
( laughing )

19:12.452 --> 19:13.920
( giggles )

19:14.987 --> 19:16.456
Women, Willy.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.291
Can't live with them...

19:19.592 --> 19:22.462
Can't think of a reason
why you'd want to.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
We've got mail?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.502
You've got mail
from the FBI.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.871
I think that agent has
the hots for you.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.308
Okay, you're right,
she's really not your type.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.277
She sent me a highly
encrypted J-Pegs.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.279
Public key's got 64 numbers.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.281
It took me longer
to input the password

19:41.314 --> 19:43.883
than it took the program
to decrypt the ciphertext.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.418
( machine whirring )

19:45.452 --> 19:47.987
Um, machine making
pretty pictures now.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.955
Yeah.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.326
( cell phone ringing )

19:53.360 --> 19:54.327
Yeah, Gibbs.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.462
You got the stills?

19:55.495 --> 19:56.463
GIBBS:
Yeah.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.530
We, um, took them off

19:57.564 --> 19:59.999
the ice cream man's computer--
Fernando Patroya.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.370
We extracted his
hard drive, cloned it

20:03.403 --> 20:04.804
and returned it.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.406
He doesn't even know.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.007
He had Commander Shields
under surveillance.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.008
Yeah.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.577
I want him brought in.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.346
Look, I told you
I can't. Not yet.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.347
We need his whole cell.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.816
We are running out of time
here, Agent Reyes.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.552
Look, you've got your people
on the family. They'll be fine.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.787
For a few more days.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.554
Don't worry,

20:21.588 --> 20:22.555
okay? After that,

20:22.589 --> 20:24.257
the FBI will pick up protection

20:24.291 --> 20:26.293
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.428
McGEE:
Boss, I need you up here.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.562
Someone in the backyard.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.498
Kate and Tony are intercepting.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.432
Come on.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.671
( loud thump )

21:01.728 --> 21:03.530
( hushed whispers )

21:04.364 --> 21:06.065
( screaming )

21:06.098 --> 21:09.502
( panting )

21:09.536 --> 21:10.803
( clattering )

21:10.837 --> 21:12.439
No! No! Wait!
It's-it's-it's...

21:12.472 --> 21:14.707
Freeze!

21:14.741 --> 21:15.742
Don't shoot him!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.043
SHIELDS:
Jen! Get out!
Don't!

21:17.076 --> 21:19.612
Get out! Jen, go now!

21:19.646 --> 21:21.047
I'm sorry!
Please don't kill me!

21:21.080 --> 21:25.051
Stand down, Tony.
It's her boyfriend.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.689
Not real bright, kid.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.524
You're lucky
you don't have

21:31.558 --> 21:34.394
two holes in that
face of yours.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.762
Boyfriend?!

21:37.664 --> 21:40.867
( over headset ):
Gibbs? Kate. False alarm.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.068
One of the kids?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.570
Daughter's boyfriend.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.405
Probably not the first
time he's snuck in,

21:45.438 --> 21:46.706
but I guarantee, the last.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.908
Mom packs a Glock.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.478
Where is Romeo now?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.680
On his way home
to change his pants.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.114
And Juliet is getting
her butt reamed

21:55.147 --> 21:56.783
by the Capulets.
Roger that.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.351
Standing down.
Keep us informed.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.452
You got it.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.853
( indistinct voices )

22:00.887 --> 22:01.754
What are you doing?!

22:01.788 --> 22:03.856
Uh... listening.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.658
That is just wrong.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.860
Sneaking your horny boyfriend
into a house filled

22:07.894 --> 22:10.430
with armed federal agents
who are on the lookout

22:10.463 --> 22:12.732
for Al Qaeda assassins--
that's wrong, Kate.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.802
Me? I'm just trying to gather
some valuable intel

22:15.835 --> 22:17.537
so I can do my job better.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.409
SHIELDS:
...but sneaking
him in like this...

22:22.442 --> 22:24.377
I mean, Jen, what the
hell were you thinking?

22:24.411 --> 22:27.414
We weren't going to
have sex, if that's
what you're worried about.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.048
That's not the point.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.917
That boy could've
been killed!

22:30.950 --> 22:32.485
You don't even
know his name!
Look, why

22:32.519 --> 22:33.686
don't we all just calm down?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.021
We've been dating
for six months, Mom.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.424
His name is Lyle, Lyle Chambers.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.925
Let's stay on
target, young lady.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.527
This is not about names.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.595
On target?! Do you think
I'm one of your sailors?

22:42.629 --> 22:44.130
That's enough,
Jennifer.
She doesn't know

22:44.163 --> 22:45.798
anything about
my life, Dad.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.667
And why do you think
that is, Commander?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.968
I'm warning you.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.703
Do not speak
to your mom like that.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.939
Oh, all of a sudden, you're
concerned with Mom's feelings?

22:52.972 --> 22:55.642
DAVID:
What is that
supposed to mean?

22:55.675 --> 22:56.809
What a joke.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.445
( exasperated laugh )

22:58.478 --> 23:00.947
Something I should know here?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.615
Forget it. Just forget it.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.518
Can I go to bed now?

23:05.552 --> 23:08.988
SHIELDS:
Fine, we'll finish this
discussion tomorrow.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.459
ABBY:
We've got a face.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.292
I think.

23:15.662 --> 23:18.831
I've seen better pictures
of Sasquatch.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.634
Well, the fact that
it's a reflection
limits the details.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.069
Well, yeah, I can see

23:23.102 --> 23:25.538
that, Abby.
!
And their face--
if it is a face--

23:25.572 --> 23:26.506
looks like it's turned away.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.608
Okay, so let's focus
on something smaller.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.776
Like what?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.010
Like a hand.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.145
If you were placing a bomb

23:33.179 --> 23:36.749
underneath a car, your other
hand would be on the side panel.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.851
Huh.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.520
That might actually work.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.689
Ooh, I can see
the paper now.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.725
"Digital Optical Enhancement
of Reflective Surfaces

23:45.758 --> 23:47.894
with Scattered
Refractive Properties."

23:47.927 --> 23:49.729
Sounds like
a bestseller.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.197
I need the answers soon, Abbs.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.005
( footsteps )

23:59.038 --> 24:01.207
( chuckles ):
Those were
happier times.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.776
Thank you.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.645
I'm sorry about last night.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.548
I-I don't know
what that girl
was thinking.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.816
It happens.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.217
Teenagers, right?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.219
It just feels
like yesterday

24:13.252 --> 24:15.888
that she was, uh...
playing with dolls

24:15.922 --> 24:17.924
and following me
around the house.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.959
But now...

24:19.992 --> 24:21.761
Well, raising a family
and having

24:21.794 --> 24:23.029
a full-time military career--

24:23.062 --> 24:24.964
I don't know
how you've managed it.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.999
I didn't.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.535
That's why I'm getting out.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.670
It had nothing to do
with Afghanistan.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.039
But you could retire
in five years.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.607
Full pension, medical.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.510
My last deployment
lasted for over a year.

24:37.544 --> 24:42.715
When I came home, my babies,
my little boy and girl...

24:42.749 --> 24:45.885
Willy wouldn't
even speak to me.

24:45.918 --> 24:49.021
And Jen was...
five inches taller

24:49.055 --> 24:52.058
and practically
a stranger.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.962
The constant moving,
the uncertainty,
the-the time away...

24:55.995 --> 24:59.799
David does a great job,
but it's too much for him,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.067
for-for all of us.

25:01.100 --> 25:06.105
Have you thought about
what you're going to
do when you get out?

25:06.138 --> 25:08.074
Learn how to be a
mother? ( chuckles )

25:08.107 --> 25:09.876
I certainly couldn't
do any worse.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.079
You're being too hard
on yourself, Commander.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.549
From where I stand,
you're a role model.

25:18.250 --> 25:22.855
You know what was my
biggest fear in the Navy?

25:22.889 --> 25:25.291
This feeling that...

25:25.324 --> 25:28.027
everything that I
was fighting for,

25:28.060 --> 25:31.598
everything that I
wanted to protect...

25:31.631 --> 25:34.567
wouldn't be here
when I got back.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.908
And now I've brought
the war home with me.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.945
( slurping )

25:47.013 --> 25:48.681
Check this out, Gibbs.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.850
We got a hand.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.121
That's a hand?

25:55.154 --> 25:56.155
That's the best
I could do.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.257
Maybe not good enough.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.860
How so?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.695
Well, for some reason
there's one area

26:02.729 --> 26:05.197
that none of the enhancement
programs will work on.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.799
Can you tell if
he's Middle Eastern?

26:06.833 --> 26:09.068
That or African-American.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.871
He's only got three fingers.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.106
I know. I think
the program screwed up.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.341
Sorry, Gibbs.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.643
He didn't.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.178
He didn't what...?

26:19.211 --> 26:21.113
Have fingers there.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.083
So, it worked?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.051
Uh-huh.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.853
Cool.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.120
So, what is he?

26:28.154 --> 26:31.290
Some sort of killer
shop teacher?

26:31.323 --> 26:34.160
Killer squid.
Thanks, Abbs.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.028
Yup.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.664
This is insane, Micki.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.966
Well, when you're
stressed, you eat. I run.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.068
Look, why don't you
just use the treadmill?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.936
It's not the same.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.104
( laughs ):
Okay, you know what?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.106
Why don't you just do
whatever you want?

26:47.139 --> 26:49.075
Okay? You always do, anyway.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.111
Agents DiNozzo and Todd are
going to be with me. It's a run.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.180
What's the worst
that could happen?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.683
Uh, you could get
shot by a sniper.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.018
That would solve
a lot of problems, wouldn't it?

26:59.051 --> 27:02.021
I can't even believe
that you said that.

27:02.054 --> 27:02.989
What is wrong with you?

27:06.192 --> 27:09.829
I can't believe
a lot of things lately, David.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.864
( sighs )

27:11.898 --> 27:14.333
KATE:
Running out in the open?
This is not a good idea.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.704
Well, she's stubborn,
won't listen to reason

27:17.737 --> 27:20.106
and is definitely used to
getting her own way.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.708
Kind of reminds me
of someone.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.809
( chuckles )

27:22.842 --> 27:24.210
Yeah, like a female Gibbs.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.112
See, I was thinking you.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.213
( doorbell rings )

27:29.982 --> 27:31.117
Nice you could
make it, Probie.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.852
Traffic was a nightmare.
I'm sorry.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.020
In the real world

27:34.053 --> 27:36.723
of real agents, we account
for things like traffic, McGee.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.225
We'll be back in about an hour.
The monster's up in his room.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.094
Listen, don't take it personally
if he completely ignores you.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.763
Which... he will.

27:43.796 --> 27:44.797
Right.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.232
McGee!

27:46.265 --> 27:48.334
Hey.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.069
( chuckles nervously )

27:51.137 --> 27:52.104
Come on!

27:52.138 --> 27:53.139
Yeah.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.945
REYES:
Reflected image?

27:58.978 --> 28:03.015
So, our bomber is
Roland Alan Moore.

28:06.418 --> 28:09.255
You don't sound
surprised, Agent Reyes.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.423
Well, he was a suspect.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.227
That's true.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.068
Eh, it's a nice office.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.102
Thanks.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.837
That a surveillance
request form?

28:24.871 --> 28:26.773
I am pretty busy here, Gibbs,

28:26.806 --> 28:29.008
so you got something
to say, say it.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.442
It's direct.
I like that.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.244
Where is he?

28:32.278 --> 28:33.179
Who?

28:33.212 --> 28:36.315
My former Petty Officer,
Roland Alan Moore.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.984
How would I know?

28:38.017 --> 28:41.287
You're lying.
Know how I can tell?

28:41.320 --> 28:44.924
Your pupils just contracted,

28:44.957 --> 28:47.326
and your heart
rate's increasing.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.096
Maybe I'm just
attracted to you.

28:50.129 --> 28:53.365
You're hoping Moore
will try it again.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.168
You want to roll up
his entire network.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.103
So, what if I am?

28:57.136 --> 29:00.239
My people are
protecting
that family.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.374
If they have to,
they will die doing it.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.844
If that happens...

29:04.877 --> 29:09.081
ask Fornell what I'd do.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.923
I run this route every day.
It'sexactly six miles.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.357
You up for an
eight-minute pace?

29:18.390 --> 29:20.392
I am. Let me check
with my partner.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.965
You up for
an eight-minute pace?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.534
Behind us, white
panel van. Been with
us the last two turns.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.504
All right, let's drop back.
If he makes this turn, we abort.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.241
McGee, we might have
a situation here.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.375
12:00.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.877
At the intersection.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.412
I see him.
Ambush?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.450
Take cover!
Break left!
Break left!

29:44.483 --> 29:46.819
( tires screeching )

29:46.853 --> 29:48.420
( groaning )

29:48.454 --> 29:52.158
( tires screeching,
car alarms blaring )

30:02.101 --> 30:04.904
MAN:
Please clear
through here.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.338
GIBBS:
How's the commander?

30:06.372 --> 30:08.140
KATE:
She's fine,
except for a few

30:08.174 --> 30:09.976
bruises she got
when she hit the deck.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.844
Tony has her
and the entire clan

30:11.878 --> 30:12.979
locked down at the house.

30:13.012 --> 30:13.846
No more runs, Kate.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.148
You don't have to tell me
twice, Gibbs.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.584
We got lucky today.

30:18.617 --> 30:22.855
The blast was mostly contained
inside the vehicle.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.590
Of course there's also the
matter of the five FBI agents

30:24.623 --> 30:25.892
that Tony and I
almost shot.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.593
They were there
for your protection.

30:27.626 --> 30:28.627
In unmarked vans

30:28.660 --> 30:29.862
and without our knowledge?

30:29.896 --> 30:32.064
Our operation's need to know,

30:32.098 --> 30:33.632
Agent Todd. You didn't.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.969
I've run presidential protection
details, Reyes.

30:37.003 --> 30:41.107
You don't assign two undercover
units without coordination.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.909
She's not interested
in protection, Kate.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.646
You wanted them to try again.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.417
The FBI thinks the assassination
team after the commander

30:51.450 --> 30:53.920
is part of a much
larger operation.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.587
And we're the bait
to draw them out.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.189
REYES:
Our Intel indicates
that they were

30:57.223 --> 30:59.091
planning something catastrophic.
We were hoping

30:59.125 --> 31:01.093
by observing this team
that they would lead us

31:01.127 --> 31:02.962
to the rest
of the network.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.596
And if the commander
and her family

31:04.630 --> 31:06.232
just happen to die
in the process?

31:10.937 --> 31:13.973
Wow. And I thought Fornell
was a bastard.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.008
GIBBS:
It was your people

31:16.042 --> 31:17.243
that were lucky today,
Agent Reyes.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.644
Oh, yeah? How do
you figure that?

31:18.677 --> 31:20.012
Because my people

31:20.046 --> 31:21.280
shoot to kill.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.016
You stay here.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.953
Make sure you get copies
of everything the FBI finds.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.654
I don't trust her.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.657
Good. You're learning.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.126
Excuse me?

31:34.160 --> 31:36.428
Um, hi.
My name is Greta Boyen.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.231
I'm a friend of the Shields.
Is Micki okay?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.033
She's fine.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.969
'Cause I actually just
live right over there

31:43.002 --> 31:43.970
and we heard the explosion

31:44.003 --> 31:45.972
and I saw her being carried away
and I thought...

31:46.005 --> 31:47.673
She was just a little dazed,
that's all.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.675
Thank God.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.310
Uh, listen, do you think
it'd be all right

31:51.343 --> 31:52.344
if we went over and visited?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.416
The best thing you
can do for her right
now, Mrs. Boyen,

31:57.449 --> 31:58.917
is go home.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.694
I got that coffee
for you, Agent Reyes.

32:08.727 --> 32:12.731
Not as strong as mine, but
if you don't want it...

32:12.764 --> 32:15.667
No, I've been waiting
20 minutes, Gibbs.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.369
I am not used to waiting.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.038
I don't like waiting.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.173
Well, yeah,
that's why I got you coffee.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.674
You sure you
don't want to try?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.977
What the hell do you want?

32:25.011 --> 32:28.180
Roland Alan Moore.
In my chat room-- one hour.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.548
Not going to happen

32:29.581 --> 32:32.051
until he leads us
to everyone in his cell.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.385
I'll get their names.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.253
Oh? How?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.621
You going to force feed him
your coffee?

32:35.654 --> 32:37.689
( laughs )

32:37.723 --> 32:39.992
You see,
DiNozzo was wrong

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
about you.
You do have a sense of humor.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.099
Don't miss the 6:00 news,
Agent Reyes.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.776
What the hell have you done?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.179
Nothing yet.
But isn't our FBI

33:00.212 --> 33:04.716
using an American family
as terrorist bait news?

33:04.750 --> 33:07.619
You'll blow our operation.

33:07.653 --> 33:11.490
Sure. But I'll also get Moore
in my chat room.

33:11.523 --> 33:15.561
Look, even an agent as arrogant

33:15.594 --> 33:16.528
as you are has to know

33:16.562 --> 33:19.198
that what you're threatening
is a career ender.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.067
Only if he doesn't talk.
If he does

33:21.100 --> 33:23.635
it's a career maker.

33:23.669 --> 33:27.573
Suzanne McRoberts, please.

33:27.606 --> 33:32.044
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.312
You've seen Suzanne on TV.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.214
She's cute, blonde,

33:35.247 --> 33:36.315
does the anchor on the news.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.089
That had better mean
we have a deal

33:43.122 --> 33:45.091
or you're going
to lose a finger.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.825
You don't crack Moore,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.595
the appendage that I'll cut off

33:49.628 --> 33:52.164
will mean so much more to you
than a finger.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.316
Oh, wow, you're reading
Moonstone.
Mm-hmm.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.084
Hey, you know, Dorothy Sayers

34:12.118 --> 34:14.086
thought it was the best
detective story ever written.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.521
And T.S. Eliot,
he called Moon...

34:15.554 --> 34:16.622
Where the hell is Gibbs?

34:16.655 --> 34:19.825
the first true
English detective novel.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.328
Uh, Gibbs is prepping Roland
Alan Moore for interrogation.

34:22.361 --> 34:25.531
Prepping?

34:25.564 --> 34:28.400
You mean, like,
physically abusing him?

34:28.434 --> 34:29.401
No, no, no.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.538
No. Gibbs never lays a finger
on a suspect,

34:32.571 --> 34:36.208
at least not after
we have him in custody.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.510
So, what the hell is it,
exactly,

34:38.544 --> 34:40.879
that he does to... "prep" them?

34:40.912 --> 34:43.882
Well, it varies
from suspect to suspect.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.118
And, um, I really can't say
what he does.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.420
Because it's illegal.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.888
No, I don't think so.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.792
Uh, no. It's usually
just a quiet conversation.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.262
GIBBS:
...after you hang yourself.

34:56.295 --> 34:59.598
By the way, do you prefer

34:59.631 --> 35:02.601
Roland or Mohammed?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.203
I'm not going
to hang myself.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.604
Oh, yeah, I know that.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.240
That's just what
my report's going say.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.709
Anyway, after you hang
yourself, your body

35:10.742 --> 35:13.245
will be autopsied here
by Dr. Mallard.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.079
Hey, Duck,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.648
where will you start
to cut on Roland?

35:16.682 --> 35:17.883
He's going to hang himself?

35:17.916 --> 35:19.151
Uh-huh.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.486
Oh, well...

35:20.519 --> 35:23.889
You're not going to do this.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.724
He doesn't know me very well,
does he?

35:25.757 --> 35:28.227
Obviously not. I remember
one terrorist we had...

35:28.260 --> 35:30.229
Ah, Duck, come on...

35:30.262 --> 35:31.897
no war stories.

35:31.930 --> 35:32.798
Oh, right.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.933
Well, I might start
with his head, Jethro.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.668
I'd make a cut here
behind the ear,

35:36.702 --> 35:38.404
around the back
to the other one.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.373
And then I'd pull the
skin down over your face

35:41.407 --> 35:42.474
so I could take

35:42.508 --> 35:44.676
the striker saw to take
the top of your skull off.

35:44.710 --> 35:45.877
Get away from me.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.747
All right, I don't think he
wants you to start there, Duck.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.582
Oh, no matter.
I can always use

35:50.616 --> 35:52.318
a "Y" cut to begin with.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.487
Let me show you.
It's quite simple, really.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.689
We take the
scalpel and we

35:57.723 --> 36:01.593
cut here and here.

36:01.627 --> 36:02.728
There we go.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.230
And then we make a cut

36:04.263 --> 36:09.201
all the way down
to just above the pubic bone.

36:09.235 --> 36:12.838
Now, we separate the skin

36:12.871 --> 36:14.306
from the muscle and tissue.

36:16.342 --> 36:20.279
And then we take these and we...

36:21.947 --> 36:23.282
we cut.

36:23.315 --> 36:26.452
( Ducky grunting )

36:30.256 --> 36:31.290
Now, once I've...

36:33.792 --> 36:36.695
opened you up--

36:36.728 --> 36:38.364
Jethro--

36:38.397 --> 36:39.465
I take this...

36:43.369 --> 36:45.471
from here...

36:45.504 --> 36:47.939
and then I can take out...

36:49.040 --> 36:51.310
your heart.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.383
( Ducky mumbling )

36:57.416 --> 37:00.352
...tubes down here.

37:00.386 --> 37:04.690
Cut away...
there, what do you know, a lung.

37:06.758 --> 37:13.365
And now we go up to the trachea
and I use this to pull it out...

37:13.399 --> 37:15.867
along with your tongue.

37:23.609 --> 37:27.979
SUZANNE McROBERT ( on TV ):
The FBI announced the arrest of
four alleged terrorists today.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.881
They are believed to be
an Al Qaeda cell

37:29.915 --> 37:32.584
responsible for the bombing
of Navy Lieutenant Commander

37:32.618 --> 37:35.454
Micki Shields' car
at a Tacoma supermarket

37:35.487 --> 37:38.290
on Wednesday and a second
car bombing yesterday

37:38.324 --> 37:39.725
on a street where
she was jogging.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.360
An FBI spokesperson said

37:41.393 --> 37:43.495
a suspect
they had under surveillance

37:43.529 --> 37:45.764
led them to a Silver Springs
apartment

37:45.797 --> 37:48.500
where they captured the entire
cell without firing a shot.

37:48.534 --> 37:51.570
Lieutenant Commander Shields
was the naval aviator...

37:53.705 --> 37:55.974
The news is really
depressing these days.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.044
You have no idea,
Commander Shields.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.479
Actually not
commander anymore.

38:00.512 --> 38:01.747
Terminal leave is up.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.749
I am just
Mrs. Micki Shields now.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.054
I kind of like
the sound of it.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.489
That's good.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.025
We going to let these people
get on with their lives

38:14.059 --> 38:15.861
or we going to stand here
and stare them to death?

38:15.894 --> 38:17.529
Uh, the equipment is
loaded and stored.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.630
Ready to move, boss.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.998
Well, then move, McGee.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.201
Oh...

38:23.234 --> 38:26.438
You tell anyone where you got
it, I will deny under oath.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.640
A blank hall pass.

38:28.674 --> 38:29.975
Signed by the principal.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.443
Undated.

38:31.477 --> 38:32.778
Erasable ink is the key.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.480
It's always worked for me.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.083
Thank you.

38:45.624 --> 38:48.394
Hey.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.430
Well, here you go.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.733
Thanks.

38:54.766 --> 38:59.538
Yeah, I wouldn't wear it
unless I had to.

38:59.571 --> 39:04.342
Cool. If there's anything
you can think of...

39:06.978 --> 39:07.979
Shades.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.383
What?

39:11.417 --> 39:12.918
I like your sunglasses.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.156
Yeah, well,
that's not surprising,

39:18.189 --> 39:21.493
because, uh, they're
super cool, Willy,

39:21.527 --> 39:23.895
but see, the thing
about these is that

39:23.929 --> 39:26.064
these are really
grownup shades.

39:26.097 --> 39:26.832
We're out of here.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.468
Thanks.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.936
Sweet.

39:36.508 --> 39:37.443
Ooh.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.815
TONY:
Polarized lenses.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.417
Impact protected.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.820
Raked-back curvature.
They were special order, boss.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.689
I never special order.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.491
Isn't that funny.
Neither do I.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.493
There's nothing funny
about this, McGee.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.528
And what part of this
conversation's about you anyway?

39:56.562 --> 39:59.197
Only the part about
special ordering.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.132
I always special order.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.001
Bright day out today.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.804
( phone rings )

40:05.837 --> 40:06.905
Yeah, Abbs?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.507
ABBY:
So, the FBI

40:08.540 --> 40:10.008
finally sent copies
of the evidence

40:10.041 --> 40:11.176
from the second bombing.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.878
The patterns don't match
the first.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.713
The second's more boom

40:14.746 --> 40:16.815
than bomb.
There was no shrapnel.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.618
Um, fertilizer and oil
instead of C-4.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.820
And placement inside the car
limited the spread.

40:21.853 --> 40:22.888
Amateur night.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.856
Sounds like.
Oh, something else,

40:24.890 --> 40:25.991
my hero.

40:26.024 --> 40:29.227
It was triggered by some sort
of crude remote control.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.395
Like a garage door opener.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.665
Couldn't have had a range
of more than a hundred feet.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.771
( tires squealing )

40:42.741 --> 40:44.543
Anything we should know, boss?

40:44.576 --> 40:45.811
The second bomb
wasn't Al Qaeda.

40:45.844 --> 40:48.213
Somebody else wants
the commander dead.

40:48.246 --> 40:52.584
We're finished. It's over.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.986
No, you're just confused, David.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.888
And it's understandable,
I would be too

40:56.922 --> 40:58.890
if Al Qaeda
were targeting my family.

40:58.924 --> 41:01.092
Greta, what we did
was a big mistake.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.730
No. What we did was right.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.732
She's brought
all this on, herself.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.800
She's put your family
in harm's way.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.268
David, everything's
gonna be better

41:10.301 --> 41:11.670
once she's gone.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.239
Do you hear what
you're saying?

41:14.272 --> 41:16.174
What? You'll see.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.275
You'll see.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.612
We could go back to how we were
before she came home.

41:20.646 --> 41:21.780
No, no, no.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.650
Greta, that's not going
to happen, okay?

41:24.683 --> 41:26.251
We were lonely.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.819
That's all it was.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.621
I love my wife.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.023
No!

41:32.057 --> 41:34.993
Don't say that, okay?

41:35.026 --> 41:36.595
That doesn't--
that's not true.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.664
Yes, it is.

41:43.669 --> 41:47.172
Well, then, I'm going
to tell her, David.

41:47.205 --> 41:51.577
If you won't, I will.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.680
You just did, Greta.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.918
Now get out of our life.

DAVID:
Oh, God.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.691
Whoa. Whoa. Gre...

42:05.724 --> 42:08.727
Greta! Put it away!

42:08.760 --> 42:11.597
He made love to me, Micki.

42:11.630 --> 42:15.734
He made love to me like
he's never made love to you.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.569
He told me that.

42:17.603 --> 42:19.971
Greta, look...

42:20.005 --> 42:21.740
just give me the gun.

42:21.773 --> 42:22.908
No!

42:22.941 --> 42:24.643
Everything's going to be fine

42:24.676 --> 42:26.712
when she's gone.
You'll see.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.279
Drop your weapon, Greta.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.649
( doorbell rings )

42:30.682 --> 42:35.320
Leave and I'll forget
all about this.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.726
I won't.

42:42.127 --> 42:44.129
Please.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.632
( doorbell rings )

42:53.772 --> 42:55.340
It was self-defense.

42:55.373 --> 42:58.143
She was just trying
to protect herself.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.595
At least time it wasn't
an innocent civilian.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.674
Actually, I did
special order once.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.779
TONY:
Just once?
