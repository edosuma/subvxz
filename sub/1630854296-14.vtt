WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:09.343
Stay with me, Clyde.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.379
Okay.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.247
Keep going, Gabs,
keep going.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.383
You got this.
Okay. Right.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.686
Ventilate. Yep.
Ventilate, ventilate.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.221
Hey, hey. Pads, pads.
Come on, come on.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.522
Gabs, he's going.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.291
He's going. Defib. Okay.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.459
Defib, right now!
Charging.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.329
Clear.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.099
And he's dead.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.437
Okay. Defib,
straight into compressions,

00:36.537 --> 00:37.805
then check the pulse.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.408
Now, you killed Clyde
three times today?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.176
I really wish
you wouldn't name him.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.411
It makes him seem real.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.778
Well, in the field,

00:44.878 --> 00:46.880
it's super real,
and his name could be Clyde.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.784
Ever since that bridge call
when we lost Meg,

00:50.884 --> 00:54.355
I just...
My medical instincts are off.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.525
Sammy.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.027
That was my first loss
that shook me.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.096
Teenage girl...

01:02.196 --> 01:04.865
Smoke inhalation got to her
before I could find her.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.769
Mine was Harold.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.639
He was a sweet, old grandpa,

01:11.739 --> 01:14.908
who died in my arms
on his 80th birthday.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.245
I still think about that.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.747
Well, I better get
over this hurdle

01:19.847 --> 01:22.150
or I won't pass my EMT board,

01:22.250 --> 01:24.618
and then I'll be
a probie forever.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.754
Well, no one's a probie forever.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.989
Well, then-then what?
Do I just...

01:29.089 --> 01:30.191
Do I get fired?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.459
No. No.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.027
Listen, you persist
and you pass.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.466
Shoot, I'm late.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.101
What're you late for?

01:42.536 --> 01:43.604
And why are you playing
with your hair

01:43.704 --> 01:45.306
like it's ever been different?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.440
Go easy on him.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.608
He has his first date
with Cara,

01:47.708 --> 01:48.942
and it's important.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.245
Oh!
Yeah, so, you know,

01:51.345 --> 01:52.813
I need a hairstyle that says,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.682
you know, "It's no big deal
that you're Bode's ex,"

01:54.782 --> 01:58.252
and that, you know, "You used to
know me when I was a player."

01:58.352 --> 02:00.488
Uh, what is all of this?

02:00.588 --> 02:01.822
Oh, no, no, no.
It's giving:

02:01.922 --> 02:03.424
"I don't want to be
a player no more,"

02:03.524 --> 02:06.160
plus, Cal Fire. You good, bro.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.162
You good. Yeah.
I'm not doing this.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.864
Okay, have a good one, bruh.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.638
I look like the Mattress King.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.576
You are the Mattress King
of this house.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.813
Oh, come on.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.817
Oh, no. That's backwards.

02:29.917 --> 02:33.421
All right.
I'll go with the hat.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.224
But this totally
undermines my authority

02:36.324 --> 02:37.725
with the fair vendors

02:37.825 --> 02:39.393
to keep their propane tanks organized.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.729
Oh, hush now,
you are the Grand Marshal

02:41.829 --> 02:44.164
of this parade,
not the fire marshal.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.599
I wasn't even on the ballot.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.000
Jake wrote me in.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.436
It's so silly.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.538
You know, most people would
consider that a compliment.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.906
I'm not most people.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.210
Um, speaking of Jake...

02:56.310 --> 02:58.279
Any clue when we might hear
from the donor team

02:58.379 --> 02:59.813
about his kidney?

02:59.913 --> 03:03.484
No, and I'm not really
focusing on their decision.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.952
However much time

03:05.052 --> 03:07.321
I have left on this earth
isn't up to the team,

03:07.421 --> 03:08.556
or Jake,

03:08.656 --> 03:10.591
or any of us.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.294
Shar, they're gonna
approve it.

03:13.394 --> 03:18.566
Well, until then, I'm gonna work
while you charm Edgewater.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.134
So if I die
waiting for a kidney,

03:21.235 --> 03:22.770
you don't become the town's

03:22.870 --> 03:25.205
grinchy widower
that nobody checks on.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.975
I will not be a widower.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.644
I'm okay with being
grinchy, though.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.581
Bye.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.115
I love the hat.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.751
See you at the Winter Fair.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.689
All right, grade team,
just, uh,

03:41.789 --> 03:43.724
hang out here for a second.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.795
Hey, stranger.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.363
Rebecca.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.998
You working this grade, too?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.466
Yeah.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.068
Looks like we're about to have
a fair to remember.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.073
You know,
you're looking really good.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.111
You okay?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.813
Yeah, today's just

04:05.913 --> 04:07.715
the closest
I've worked with civilians,

04:07.815 --> 04:09.683
other than a fire,
in a long time.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.620
Want to make a good impression
on the grade.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.455
To who? Cap?

04:14.555 --> 04:15.856
People I grew up with

04:15.956 --> 04:17.925
who now only see me
as a cautionary tale.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.095
Well, as someone who's worked
a bunch of these grades already,

04:22.195 --> 04:24.131
the novelty wears off.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.667
You don't have to be
so perfect all the time.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.904
Uh, it's kind of
different for me.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.474
You know,
working the town fair

04:33.574 --> 04:36.143
that I used to go to as a kid,

04:36.243 --> 04:37.345
but now in orange.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.480
All right.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.881
You're tense.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.651
You know, we could work
through that together,

04:43.751 --> 04:45.886
maybe in the woods later?

04:48.188 --> 04:51.592
Rebecca, you're great, but... Wow.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.862
The "you're great but" line?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.931
Is this about
the Cap's daughter again?

04:58.031 --> 05:01.034
You two make it official
or something?

05:03.471 --> 05:04.805
No.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.239
Not until I parole.

05:06.340 --> 05:10.077
Oh, so you're just dumping me
for nobody?

05:11.479 --> 05:12.813
All right, grade team,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.815
just, uh, hang out
for a little longer. Bode.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.884
Rebecca. Follow me.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.258
Keep at it, probie.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.829
Hey, Eve, can you hook us up
with some sandbags

05:28.929 --> 05:30.230
for the parade route?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.933
Yeah. Gabs, can you show them
the supply room?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.769
All right, Counselor.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.005
Bode, follow Gabriela.
Grab the sandbags.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.374
Load them into the buggy.
This way.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.345
You ready to shadow?

05:45.446 --> 05:48.582
First lesson: find balance
between the spirit of the rule

05:48.682 --> 05:50.183
and the letter of the law.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.052
Grade projects give inmates
a sense of trust.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.955
It show the community
that they're here to help.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.057
And it's a little free PR.
Win-win.
Plus,

05:57.157 --> 05:59.292
the camp gets a little cash
bonus for the grade project.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.795
How do you decide
how to allocate those funds?

06:01.895 --> 06:04.164
Well, you've really
read up, huh?

06:04.264 --> 06:07.367
Well, the-the folks
in Sacramento,

06:07.468 --> 06:09.002
they told me about the kickback.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.607
Well, it's not exactly
a "kickback."

06:13.707 --> 06:16.309
You spoke to Sacramento?

06:16.410 --> 06:20.280
Yeah, the whole department has
their eyes on Three Rock.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.721
You a shadow or a spy?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.289
Cap?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.792
I'm just
messing with you.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.327
We're just gonna stick
to the basics, okay?

06:36.296 --> 06:38.031
And that's it.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.706
This what you're looking for?

06:45.806 --> 06:49.142
Perfect. Just perfect.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.547
You working the fair today?
Yeah.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.815
Little nervous.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.316
It's a great opportunity.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.919
And risk.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.354
A civilian even says
I looked at them the wrong way,

07:01.455 --> 07:03.323
I could lose fire camp altogether.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.828
Okay, but with great trust
comes great responsibility.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.631
At least,
that's what my dad says.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.299
Poetic.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.635
Little help here?

07:35.088 --> 07:37.024
Everyone's a winner!
What? We won.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.794
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.362
Where do you want to go?
He's cute.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.097
Um, you want to
play Whac-A-Mole?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.099
I'm very good at it.
Oh, okay, let's go.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.408
Perfect!

08:05.519 --> 08:06.787
Bode Leone.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.022
Wow.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.924
See you put that baseball
scholarship you beat me out for

08:11.024 --> 08:12.726
to good use.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.995
Aaron.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.264
Not trying to open up
any old beefs.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.166
Yeah, I knew I was
the better choice back then,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.935
and I can see
I'm the better man today.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.937
Look at God,
showing me validation.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.506
Yeah, I don't think

08:26.607 --> 08:27.575
God does petty.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.176
Hey.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.811
Rebecca, stop. Stop, stop.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.247
As much as I would love to
get into it with this dude...

08:35.015 --> 08:37.284
...there's-there's too much
on the line for us.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.753
Mm. All right, kids,

08:39.853 --> 08:42.389
let's not waste
any more fair time. Come on.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.262
Donating a kidney to Sharon.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.333
That's taking this whole
Superman thing you got going

08:53.433 --> 08:54.602
to the next level.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.804
I really have a Superman thing?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.972
Yeah. Since high school.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.040
Though, back then,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.743
it was letterman energy.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.414
You anxious for surgery?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.550
Uh, a group of strangers
are voting to decide

09:10.651 --> 09:13.887
how many kidneys I have
for the rest of my life.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.024
So that's a "yes" to anxious.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.259
More anxious than
getting thrown on this thing

09:19.359 --> 09:21.228
and tossed
like a chew toy?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.730
Tickets ready. 25 tickets.
A little bit.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.532
You remember coming here
in high school?

09:25.633 --> 09:27.635
Me with Bode.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.370
You with
your flavor-of-the-month.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.105
I'm not too proud of
my dating habits back then.

09:32.205 --> 09:37.044
Oh, so Superman's evolved.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.578
Ride's full this round.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.281
Yeah.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.917
Yeah, you know,
I like to think so.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.095
You okay?

09:55.195 --> 09:56.396
You know, let's see.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.498
After I had the pleasure
of being dumped

09:58.598 --> 10:00.033
while incarcerated,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.569
I got to marinate
in your new love connection,

10:02.670 --> 10:04.137
so not my favorite day.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.073
You and I were
always just casual.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.142
I didn't think
that you'd care if we stopped.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.477
I don't.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.054
Is it always this fast?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.690
I don't know,

10:22.790 --> 10:25.458
but that does not sound right.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.462
Hey.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.399
Hey!

10:32.499 --> 10:33.934
Yo, my man!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.703
What's going on?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.370
Cut it off. Uh...

10:37.470 --> 10:39.973
Um, something's broken.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.116
Hey, wh-where are you going?
Where are you going?

10:49.216 --> 10:52.085
What's it to you, Bode?

10:52.886 --> 10:54.688
We were casual,

10:54.788 --> 10:56.924
and now we're over.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.360
Rebecca!

11:00.961 --> 11:03.030
Get down!

11:30.157 --> 11:31.725
This is chaos.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.261
Ma'am, hey! Ma'am.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.863
You okay?
Can you stand?

11:35.963 --> 11:37.097
Jamie!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.900
Aaron! Aaron! Get down!
Take cover!

11:40.000 --> 11:42.502
Here. Come on.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.704
Hey, evacuate her and get Cap.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.473
My kids! My kids are
in that bounce house!

11:46.573 --> 11:48.608
We'll get 'em out.
Let's go.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.411
Jamie! Zack!

11:56.850 --> 11:58.418
Come on!

11:58.518 --> 12:00.520
Hey!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.389
Shut it down!

12:02.489 --> 12:03.590
Something's broken.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.892
I don't how
this engine works.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.193
I don't even have
my driver's license yet!

12:06.293 --> 12:08.295
Okay. The control panel's
unresponsive.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.697
No, come on, come on, come on.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.232
We need to anchor it!

12:12.332 --> 12:13.834
How?
It's not working.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.435
I-I don't know
what to do.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.669
Weigh it down!

12:16.770 --> 12:18.738
We're not heavy enough!

12:19.339 --> 12:20.740
Hey!

12:20.841 --> 12:23.510
Hey, I need some hands
over here!

12:23.610 --> 12:25.879
Perez, your radio.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.583
Chief, over here!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.720
Greencrest, this is Chief Leone.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.923
We've got an out-of-control ride
at the Edgewater Fair.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.625
Multiple injuries.
Need ambulances.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.796
42 and Three Rock.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.065
All hands on deck.
We need bodies out here, ASAP.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.133
Let's go.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.734
Copy that.
Let's go, guys.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.402
Cap, shrapnel form the ride
pierced the bounce house.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.171
It's collapsing
and swallowing the kids inside.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.605
Do we listen to Chief Leone,

12:52.705 --> 12:54.141
or do we follow the new lead?
What's the call?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.408
Three Rock follows
Chief Leone's orders,

12:55.508 --> 12:57.210
but I handle the bounce house.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.611
Chief Leone delegates,

12:58.711 --> 13:00.313
I delegate, too,
so you're gonna come with me.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.149
And you guys, you're gonna grab
the rest of Three Rock,

13:02.249 --> 13:04.051
head over to that ride,
follow the chief's every order.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.352
You copy?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.954
We're on it, Cap.
All right. Let's move.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.989
Let's go.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.959
Greencrest, this is D.C. Leone
here, assuming I.C.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.261
of the Winter Fair.
Come on. Come on.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.896
Have a seat right here.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.497
Perez,

13:17.597 --> 13:18.698
set up
a casualty collection point.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.767
My gut says
we're gonna have

13:20.868 --> 13:22.069
many more patients.

13:22.169 --> 13:22.970
Come on in.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.238
Have a seat right here.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.310
Perez?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.046
Uh, permission to get
more hands?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.482
Why?
Cara's here. She's an ER nurse.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.749
Okay. Go, quickly.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.251
Both of you come right
back here to me.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.596
Three Rock!
Help us anchor this thing.

13:49.696 --> 13:50.730
Chris, there's got to be
an emergency stop.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.000
I don't know, man!

13:54.902 --> 13:57.237
Chris, think. Okay?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.906
You know this machine
better than I do.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.674
Where is it?
I'll check the hatch.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.843
Hey, Cara.
We need more hands in triage.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.179
In the food tent.
I'm yours.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.870
All right.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.105
Just stay still.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.606
I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.741
Hey, hey. Hey.
I'm gonna get you out of here,

14:34.841 --> 14:36.176
all right, buddy?
I know it hurts.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.844
Get this off me.
Get it off me.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.013
Do not move.
I need you to stay still.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.385
Excellent extrication, team.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.120
There you go.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.156
Hey, hey. I still
can't find my other son, Jamie.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.757
He was, he was
in there, too.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.359
We got everyone
out of the bounce house.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.826
Well, obviously, you didn't.
The bounce house is empty.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.963
All those kids are
back with their parents.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.965
Then where...
then where's Jamie?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.167
D.C. Leone,
we've got a missing kid,

15:00.267 --> 15:01.668
unrelated to the bounce house.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.170
Vince has his hands full.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.471
Manny, your guys are gonna
have to begin the search.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.540
Wait, inmates searching
for a kid?

15:07.640 --> 15:08.608
Spirit of the rule, right?

15:08.708 --> 15:09.809
Copy that, Chief.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.111
We're all over it.
Let's move.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.845
Hey, hey, please.
Help me find him.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.747
We'll find him, all right?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.216
We'll find him. Let's go.
Come on.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.085
All right, Chris.
Just easy breaths.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.352
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.720
Nice and slow.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.555
It-it hurts.

15:22.655 --> 15:23.623
I-I know, buddy, I know.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.192
Chief.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.994
We can't get to the emergency
brake unless we move him.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.161
We can't move him
without risking a bleed-out.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.696
What if we make

15:29.796 --> 15:30.863
an access point from this end?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.065
Cut along the base?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.100
Make a hole big enough,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.301
one of us can get through there,

15:34.401 --> 15:35.969
hit the emergency brake.
I'm on it.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.370
I'll grab my gear
from the engine.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.813
Do regular people keep
meeting like this?

15:46.913 --> 15:48.948
Over traumas and emergencies?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.483
Regular people are boring.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.386
I'll assess
and organize patients.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.089
I'm really glad you're here.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.429
Where's Gabriela?

16:16.009 --> 16:17.110
Hold on tight!

16:17.210 --> 16:18.778
You're about to be stopped!

16:28.021 --> 16:29.022
D.C. Leone.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.290
Finally got the ride shut down,

16:30.390 --> 16:31.424
but it's still elevated.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.625
We need a ladder
at the incident site.

16:32.725 --> 16:33.626
Copy, Chief.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.495
I don't feel so good.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.764
Just breathe, buddy. We're
gonna get you out of here.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.832
What about them?

16:39.932 --> 16:42.169
Get me down!

16:48.007 --> 16:49.209
Are you sure that Jamie
said bounce house?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.544
Yes, he asked for 25 tickets.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.749
The bounce house is free.
It doesn't take tickets.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.219
Perez.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.888
You want to have a go at
coordinating the ladder truck?

17:01.988 --> 17:03.490
I'd love to, Chief.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.660
All right, hey, Chris.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.229
Listen, buddy, I know
you're in a lot of pain.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.530
Okay?
Yeah.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.399
But I need you to help me out, okay?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.367
Do you remember the max capacity
of this ride?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.568
It was full, remember?

17:15.668 --> 17:19.005
It can fit 30 people. Good.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.240
Jamie's, what, ten?
Yes.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.541
He's ten.
Okay, well,

17:21.641 --> 17:22.675
you sure that he didn't
try and sneak on

17:22.775 --> 17:23.543
one of these bigger rides?
No.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.245
No. I know my son.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.347
Jamie doesn't lie.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.615
Jamie!

17:28.715 --> 17:30.583
Jamie, can you hear me?

17:30.683 --> 17:33.052
Hey, bro, you okay?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.823
Why do you want to slum it
with a bunch of orange jumpsuits

17:36.923 --> 17:39.025
that people don't even trust
to look for their kids?

17:39.126 --> 17:40.593
Why are you letting that guy
slow you down

17:40.693 --> 17:42.028
from finding this kid?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.397
You're right.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.732
I know I am.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.034
Go check the bigger rides.
I'll update Cap.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.506
Hey, Cap.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.308
I sent Bode to
expand the search.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.709
So, he's over at the...
Wait, so you...

17:56.809 --> 17:58.778
You gave a direct order
to one of my crew?

17:59.979 --> 18:02.415
What are you,
my shadow or my replacement?

18:02.515 --> 18:05.285
I thought
you were joking earlier.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.686
I run my crew the way I see fit.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.555
You have suggestions,
direct them to my inbox.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.056
Email or...?

18:10.157 --> 18:11.991
Trash can, Eve.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.860
All right, Three Rock,
here's what I want you to do.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.962
Keep searching with Bode
and help find that kid.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.797
All right? Go.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.402
They need extra hands
on the ladder.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.904
Copy you.

18:25.004 --> 18:28.308
What do you think, Chris?
You ready to get out of here?

18:28.408 --> 18:30.643
Get this thing out of me.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.945
Yeah, about that.
Listen, buddy.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.881
We're gonna leave a piece of
the hatch still attached to you

18:34.981 --> 18:36.816
for the hospital to remove.
What?

18:36.916 --> 18:38.785
Yeah, j-just for now.
It's staunching your bleeding.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.720
No, no, no, you got to get
this thing out of me.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.289
You don't want us to do that.
Yeah, I do.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.790
Trust me.
No, on this thing,
you got to trust us.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.758
Okay?
Can you do that for us?

18:46.426 --> 18:49.862
Just keep breathing, real slow,
steady, all right?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.966
Okay.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.102
I trust you.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.570
Kind of don't have a choice.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.571
There you go.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.606
That's the spirit.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.441
All right, ready?

19:01.541 --> 19:02.642
All right.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.476
Hi, ma'am.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.544
My name is Gabriela.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.346
Can you hear me?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.614
How are you feeling?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.582
One second.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.018
Grab my hand.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.321
Oh, God. I'm nauseous.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.256
Okay, that's to be expected.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.924
We're gonna get you down, okay?

19:18.024 --> 19:20.260
We're gonna take care of you.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.931
All right, they're ready.
Up on rope!

19:25.031 --> 19:26.233
Ready!

19:26.333 --> 19:27.367
Okay, bring them up.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.273
Keep her steady, Bubba,
keep her steady.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.607
You got it, Cap.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.911
There you go!
Thank you.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.214
Swing her out a little bit,
swing her out.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.787
My chest.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.290
It's tight.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.459
And-and I feel light-headed.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.827
Possible cardiac event
over here!

19:54.927 --> 19:57.297
Get her over to triage.
Let's go.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.132
But i-it's medical.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.534
Remember Clyde this morning?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.902
I-I'm not...

20:03.002 --> 20:04.471
I'm the one making the decision.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.772
And that's an order, probie.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.340
Go.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.741
Come on, hustle.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.077
Hustle, hustle, hustle.
Let's go.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.582
D.C. Leone.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.384
I have a patient
from the ride.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.051
Possible cardiac event.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.887
Miss, can you tell me your name?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.692
Oh, she's going unconscious.
Okay, okay.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.060
Checking for a pulse.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.197
No pulse. Get me an AED.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.499
On it.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.666
Come on.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.404
All right,
beginning compressions.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.838
Here we go.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.174
Gabriela.
Come on.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.377
Come on, you diagnosed it.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.313
Treat it now.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.948
I can't move.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.383
I can't have someone die
on me again.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.252
Okay, then you do exactly
what I tell you right now.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.755
I can't.
Cara.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.758
Take her place.
Perez, move back.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.877
You got to be kidding me.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.512
What the hell are you doing?

21:20.279 --> 21:24.584
Just a little taste
of freedom, you know?

21:24.684 --> 21:26.218
We call 'em "grade finds."

21:26.319 --> 21:27.487
Little cigarette here,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.021
a little beer there.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.791
Maybe a lot of beer.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.394
You want to throw away
all the good time

21:34.494 --> 21:36.295
you've done for a drink?

21:44.671 --> 21:47.574
I hurt you.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.208
I realize that now.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.111
But, you know, drinking is just
gonna make that hurt worse

21:52.211 --> 21:54.714
if Cap finds out.
What, you gonna narc on me?

21:54.814 --> 21:57.784
No. Look at me.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.422
You never took a drink.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.956
I sure did.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.725
Not as far
as anybody else knows.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.226
'Cause you're gonna stay
by my side,

22:07.326 --> 22:09.796
and we're-we're gonna finish
this grade together.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.731
I just keep playing
our conversation over and over

22:11.831 --> 22:13.566
in my head.
Rebecca, just stop, stop.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.101
There's a missing kid now.

22:15.201 --> 22:18.104
I know you.
I know you want to help.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.274
Yeah.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.643
Yeah, sorry.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.744
All right, let's go.
Come on.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.845
No time for sorries.
Let's go.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.747
Take it easy.
Let's go.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.115
There you go. Whoa.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.116
You got him?

22:30.216 --> 22:31.117
Yeah, I got him.

22:31.217 --> 22:31.951
There you go.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.086
Nice.
All right.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.922
I got you, bud. Come on.
That's the last one.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.457
I counted 29,
but there's supposed to be 30.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.591
Did I miscount?

22:38.691 --> 22:41.160
No, no, me, too.
29 out of 30?

22:41.260 --> 22:43.195
Um...

22:43.295 --> 22:45.297
Wait a sec.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.570
I...

22:50.670 --> 22:52.472
I think one of
the safety chains broke off.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.840
I think there were

22:53.940 --> 22:56.409
30 passengers,
but I think one of them...

22:56.509 --> 22:57.610
was thrown off.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.145
Well, if you're right,

22:59.245 --> 23:01.948
then that passenger
could've been flung anywhere.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.717
And in any condition
with a trauma like that.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.220
Hey, Chief. Chief.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.989
We think a civilian might've
been thrown off this ride.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.425
Broken safety chain
on one of the seats.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.261
Hey, Chris,
last time you checked,

23:15.361 --> 23:18.297
any of the safety chains
on this thing broken?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.932
Mm-mm.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.334
Good catch, Cap.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.804
It wasn't my catch, Chief.
It was Eve's.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.940
So, now we've got
a missing passenger

23:28.040 --> 23:29.141
and a missing kid.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.777
Hey, I-I think

23:30.877 --> 23:32.244
it's the same person.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.345
Kid name Jamie.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.916
Shar, it's possible this kid

23:37.016 --> 23:38.685
might've gotten
flung off the broken ride.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.553
Wait, wait, you think
Jamie was on this ride?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.288
This ride costs 25 tickets.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.723
That's the amount
that he asked you for, right?

23:43.823 --> 23:44.891
Yeah, yeah, but he-he's

23:44.991 --> 23:46.493
way too little
for this ride.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.197
How could I let this happen?
Aaron, look.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.398
My parents,
these crews and I,

23:52.499 --> 23:53.866
we'll find him.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.235
All right? Let my family help
your family.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.178
All right, so Jamie's ten years
old, he's about 70 pounds.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.580
Brown hair and glasses.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.549
Kid that small is gonna have
serious injuries.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.083
He'll need immediate
medical attention.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.351
All right, Three Rock,
we're gonna split up into pairs.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.520
Buddy system.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.287
Jake, you're with me.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.556
Hey, Cap.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.457
I'm still shadowing you. Great.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.126
Cap, uh,

24:20.226 --> 24:22.394
Rebecca with me?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.437
She's gonna be okay.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.440
Stand up, probie.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.878
Name?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.813
Gabriela Perez.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.415
Incident location?

24:43.516 --> 24:45.652
Edgewater Winter Fair.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.221
Highest ranking
commanding officer?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.926
You, ma'am.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.494
Division Chief Leone.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.363
Did you ignore
a direct order from me

24:57.463 --> 24:59.398
to return to this tent?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.002
I didn't...
Come on.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.737
Speak freely.

25:09.375 --> 25:12.645
Do you know why I choked
at the Olympics?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.047
No.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.251
At practice,

25:19.351 --> 25:23.089
before the competition,

25:23.189 --> 25:28.494
I saw a phenomenal diver
hit her head on the board.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.733
She was just a fraction
of an inch off.

25:33.833 --> 25:38.237
And after that,
every time I dove,

25:38.337 --> 25:41.073
I flinched,

25:41.173 --> 25:44.877
I flinched until...

25:44.977 --> 25:47.013
I quit.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.181
And-and after we...

25:50.182 --> 25:54.821
After we couldn't save Meg
out there in the woods...

25:57.256 --> 25:59.358
It's the same feeling,

25:59.458 --> 26:03.395
except with someone else's life
on the line.

26:03.495 --> 26:06.432
This theory is wildly misguided.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.801
Sit down.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.675
We are here to be of service.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.577
And you, as a probie,
are here to use

26:18.678 --> 26:20.512
the skills you've acquired

26:20.613 --> 26:22.448
and carry them out
under the command of

26:22.548 --> 26:24.116
a higher ranking officer.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.718
That's it.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.356
I understand.
I will try and...

26:30.456 --> 26:33.726
But, first, we have to deal
with these panic attacks,

26:33.826 --> 26:36.195
'cause you're not
the only one having them.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.864
They come for all of us.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.966
Your responsibility is
to find some tools

26:40.066 --> 26:41.668
to deal with them,

26:41.768 --> 26:44.303
so you can earn being
in my triage.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.741
So you earn being
a firefighter.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.578
That's an order.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.328
He got flung this far,

27:09.428 --> 27:10.930
it would've at least
broken some bones,

27:11.030 --> 27:12.364
and how could...

27:12.464 --> 27:13.833
How would he have moved
after that?

27:13.933 --> 27:15.735
Uh, maybe something
broke his fall?

27:19.371 --> 27:21.841
Stuffed animals.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.247
These dolls could've
cushioned his fall. Yeah.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.751
Yeah, but he's still not here.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.056
He was.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.691
Why wouldn't he stay put?

27:38.791 --> 27:42.428
Jamie? Jamie!

27:45.231 --> 27:47.066
No luck.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.600
You don't say.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.602
Hey, Cap.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.204
You know what?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.874
Y-You gave me my credit back
there with Chief, and I...

27:54.974 --> 27:57.076
so I thought,
whatever this was, was over,

27:57.176 --> 27:59.111
but obviously you need
to say something to me.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.115
All right.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.852
When you report back to your
little friends in Sacramento,

28:05.952 --> 28:07.119
you can tell them
whatever you want

28:07.219 --> 28:10.156
about how I allocate
my resources.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.623
From this grade project

28:11.724 --> 28:13.760
or whatever crumbs of funding
they may give me.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.594
But you let them know
that everything I do,

28:15.694 --> 28:18.064
and every choice I make,
it's for my guys.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.166
It's for their futures.
Oh, I know.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.134
I can see that, Cap.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.270
I-I'm not reporting
back to Sacramento.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.637
That's not...

28:25.738 --> 28:27.840
Then what are you doing?
I-I'm shadowing you.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.308
You're not trailing me?

28:29.408 --> 28:33.145
No. The work you do excites me.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.814
I-I love my job.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.216
I love the rush
that it gives me.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.418
And sharing that rush
with inmates

28:39.518 --> 28:42.054
who otherwise wouldn't
have had the chance to do it?

28:43.923 --> 28:46.926
It was a rush
I wasn't expecting.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.696
And I want more.

28:51.597 --> 28:55.334
I see you and I see Bode,

28:55.434 --> 28:58.004
and I see them,

28:58.104 --> 28:59.972
and they deserve
a second chance.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.909
And you're out here
giving it to 'em.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.877
So I want to help you

29:04.977 --> 29:06.378
argue for more funding.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.781
That's why I'm asking questions.
I'm in your corner, Cap.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.786
But you got to let me be.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.288
It's no good.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.424
Chief, I hate to say it,

29:18.524 --> 29:20.860
but what if somebody took him?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.628
I already notified PD,

29:22.728 --> 29:24.163
but around here,

29:24.263 --> 29:26.298
more likely
somebody helped him.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.668
This kid
running off

29:29.768 --> 29:31.938
trying to sneak on rides
reminds me of the time

29:32.038 --> 29:34.173
Bode skipped school
and went to Great America park.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.076
I remember, uh, he was worried
you'd be so pissed

29:37.176 --> 29:39.345
that he hid at my place
till you cooled off.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.882
That's right, he did.

29:43.582 --> 29:47.353
A kid in trouble
will always try to hide.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.856
Jamie!

29:52.091 --> 29:55.327
Hey, attention,
42 and Three Rock.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.097
This kid, he-he may be
more than just hurt.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.599
He could be hiding someplace.
Let's get creative.

30:00.699 --> 30:03.535
Okay? Let's, uh,
broaden up the search.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.972
Look for potential hiding spots.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.609
Damn good hiding spot.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.278
Yeah.

30:15.514 --> 30:19.651
<i>We have to
deal with these panic attacks.</i>

30:19.751 --> 30:21.854
<i>Under the command of
a higher ranking officer.</i>

30:21.954 --> 30:23.455
<i>We are here to be of service.</i>

30:23.555 --> 30:25.391
<i>You can earn being in my triage.</i>

30:31.163 --> 30:33.465
Jamie? Jamie, are you in here?

30:33.565 --> 30:35.601
Jamie?
Jamie?

30:35.701 --> 30:36.969
He could've hit his head.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.770
You know, be disoriented
in here.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.807
Okay, shh. You hear that?

30:41.908 --> 30:43.309
Carny music from hell?

30:43.409 --> 30:46.212
No, wheezing.
What?

30:46.312 --> 30:47.446
Jamie.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.116
Jamie. Jamie,
where are you, buddy?

30:50.216 --> 30:52.184
Jamie?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.354
Oh, my God.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.157
Jamie.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.193
I think he's having
an asthma attack.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.863
He's suffocating.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.334
Hey. Hey, Jamie, Jamie.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.469
Did you use your inhaler?

31:11.103 --> 31:13.372
It's empty. Go grab somebody
from my dad's crew

31:13.472 --> 31:14.373
and get a med bag.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.574
Go.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.709
Okay.
Go. Hey.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.611
Hey. Jamie.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.513
Jaime, you'll be all right, okay?

31:21.613 --> 31:23.215
We're gonna get you some help.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.094
Gabriela!

31:35.194 --> 31:36.495
Gabriela!

31:36.595 --> 31:38.030
What?

31:38.130 --> 31:40.099
What-what's going on?
Bode found the missing kid,

31:40.199 --> 31:41.367
and he can't breathe.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.568
He's in trouble,
he really needs your help

31:42.668 --> 31:44.903
Okay, yeah.
Come on.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.908
Hey.
Gabriela.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.744
Bode.
I think he's having
an asthma attack.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.380
His inhaler's empty.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.714
I think he stopped breathing.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.049
He doesn't have--
He doesn't have a pulse.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.350
He needs CPR, now. Um...

31:58.450 --> 31:59.952
No, D.C. Leone said that

32:00.052 --> 32:01.520
I had to be ready to be
of service, and I'm not ready.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.389
You are ready,
you always have been.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.924
You did it for me.
You can do it for Jamie.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.194
Not trying would be
so much worse.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.861
Come on.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.199
Um, starting compressions.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.234
Bode,

32:15.334 --> 32:16.969
I need you to grab my radio

32:17.069 --> 32:18.137
and ask for a nebulizer

32:18.237 --> 32:19.838
and albuterol.
Incident Command,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.241
Gabriela and I found Jamie
in the Kreepy Kastle.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.344
He's having an asthma attack.
We need a nebulizer and...

32:25.444 --> 32:26.812
Albuterol!

32:26.912 --> 32:28.614
Copy. Sending a medic your way.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.482
Probie, I know you'll do
everything you can.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.385
Be of service.
Come on, breathe for me.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.254
Breathe for me.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.355
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.224
Come on.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.258
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.926
Okay. Okay, okay.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.428
Bode, I need you to help
me sit him up.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.895
Is he...
is he still having an attack?

32:43.996 --> 32:45.364
Yes,

32:45.464 --> 32:46.565
but he's...

32:46.665 --> 32:47.933
it'll help him
breathe better.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.868
Okay, okay.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.004
There you go. Okay.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.106
Over here? Yeah, we'll take him. Okay.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.142
Okay, come on.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.980
Thank you for finding her.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.550
It's the least I could do.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.685
You two work well together.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.722
You're lucky...

33:10.822 --> 33:13.792
to have someone like her
waiting for you.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.774
Jamie?

33:28.874 --> 33:32.111
Jamie. Hey.
Hey, buddy. You okay?

33:33.312 --> 33:35.681
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.484
I snuck on the ride.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.152
I know.
I'm sorry.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.989
I know, bud. It's okay.
It's okay, all right?

33:44.090 --> 33:46.758
Just take it easy.
Keep that on there.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.461
There you go.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.197
Bode.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.964
Thank you.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.667
The way I talked to you earlier,

33:55.767 --> 33:57.403
that wasn't right, man.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.972
It's in the past.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.842
And, you know,
uh, they-they should--

34:03.942 --> 34:05.444
should've probably given
the scholarship

34:05.544 --> 34:07.413
to the player
who was early to every practice.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.717
Nah.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.619
I think getting knocked down

34:13.719 --> 34:16.555
taught me
how to get back up.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.761
Okay, buddy.
You're gonna be okay.

34:22.861 --> 34:23.995
I'm right here, all right?

34:24.096 --> 34:26.732
I'm right here.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.335
Ready to lift?
Yep.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.602
Looks like you figured it out

34:30.702 --> 34:32.804
just as quickly
as I knew you would.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.675
I'm sorry I wasn't my best.

34:36.775 --> 34:40.312
No apology necessary
except for disobeying orders.

34:41.147 --> 34:43.182
I think you just got over
a huge obstacle

34:43.282 --> 34:44.183
to use your skills

34:44.283 --> 34:46.051
to help, and...

34:46.152 --> 34:48.053
that's what this work
is all about.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.855
So...

34:49.955 --> 34:52.791
Apology accepted.
Now we move on.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.574
Hey, Eve.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.676
Hold up a sec.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.413
Nice work, y'all.
Yup.

35:14.513 --> 35:17.048
Good work today. Thanks. Thanks.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.621
I hit a little bit of
a rough patch

35:22.721 --> 35:25.991
a while back, and I...

35:26.091 --> 35:27.359
think you noticed.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.628
On Charlie's last day, yeah.
You were tired.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.164
Exhausted.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.965
You told me to get help.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.202
I did.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.574
Look, I made my mess, Eve,

35:42.674 --> 35:45.644
and talking to you today
about funding...

35:47.646 --> 35:49.114
I overreacted.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.750
I'm sorry.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.356
You know, um...

35:57.456 --> 35:59.258
on that day,

35:59.358 --> 36:02.027
you told me you see me.

36:03.429 --> 36:06.265
And I believed you.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.000
I do.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.136
You're an exceptional
firefighter, Eve.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.140
And I know Jake gets
a lot of the glory,

36:15.241 --> 36:16.908
but you,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.578
you're quietly
taking care of business,

36:19.678 --> 36:23.114
and I respect
the hell out of that.

36:23.915 --> 36:28.454
And I learned today that
you do get the joy of fire camp

36:28.554 --> 36:30.689
and of this work.

36:30.789 --> 36:34.593
But I got to warn you, man.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.496
There is no glamour
in my job.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.830
I don't scare easily, man.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.300
I know you don't.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.836
Stop by Three Rock next week.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.839
Maybe boss Bode around
a little bit.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.475
Oh.

36:49.575 --> 36:50.976
That makes it worth it, baby.

37:02.153 --> 37:05.023
Oh, hey, Cara, uh...

37:05.123 --> 37:07.092
Found this guy.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.730
So, um...

37:11.830 --> 37:16.935
Was this the worst first date
that you've ever had?

37:17.035 --> 37:19.838
I got to help people.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.409
And I've been on
way worse first dates.

37:26.111 --> 37:27.813
Hey, listen, um,

37:27.913 --> 37:30.115
about what
we were talking about,

37:30.215 --> 37:32.384
before, you know...

37:32.484 --> 37:33.619
All hell broke loose?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.256
Cara, I...

37:40.359 --> 37:41.560
Cara, I have baggage.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.330
I mean, Bode, Riley.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.398
Gabriela.

37:50.369 --> 37:53.605
I'm trying to own it.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.543
So I hope that it's not too much
of a deal-breaker for you.

37:57.643 --> 38:01.613
You're skipping to baggage
before I get to know you.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.518
Not you from high school,

38:06.618 --> 38:08.520
not Bode's best friend,

38:08.620 --> 38:11.122
but you.

38:14.560 --> 38:19.565
So, what I'm hearing is...

38:19.665 --> 38:21.800
there might be a second date?

38:22.668 --> 38:25.337
What I'm saying is...

38:25.437 --> 38:28.674
the first date doesn't
have to be over.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.284
Mm. Ah.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.652
Oh.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.020
Let me silence this.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.022
Um...

38:44.122 --> 38:46.858
I am-- I'm-I'm so sorry.
This is important.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.226
Oh.
I mean, not...

38:48.326 --> 38:50.762
I know.
You know, not that this isn't...

38:51.697 --> 38:54.866
Go. Go, go be Superman.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.408
This is Jake.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.618
Hey.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.586
Sneaking in the women's camp.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.287
What a gentleman.

39:20.526 --> 39:23.094
Grade project today
was pretty surreal.

39:25.063 --> 39:28.299
Yeah. I almost screwed it up.

39:30.402 --> 39:31.503
You helped save a kid.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.240
Thanks to you.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.443
No.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.244
It was both of us.

39:42.514 --> 39:47.719
You know, having you to talk to
has changed my whole world here.

39:47.819 --> 39:48.787
What do you mean?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.658
I'm no Miss Congeniality.

39:52.758 --> 39:56.762
Okay? I argue,
and I flirt.

39:56.862 --> 40:00.098
Sometimes at the same time.

40:00.198 --> 40:03.401
I don't make friends easy,

40:03.502 --> 40:08.474
and fire camp has been
really lonely for me.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.478
Until you.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.520
Yeah, I-I've been thinking.

40:22.521 --> 40:26.892
You've got this bad track just
playing on repeat in your head.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.895
I know the feeling.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.964
So, I, um...

40:34.199 --> 40:38.403
I got you something
to make it stop.

40:43.675 --> 40:47.178
Music costs a pretty penny
in here.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.381
It's nothing
for a friend in need.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.557
