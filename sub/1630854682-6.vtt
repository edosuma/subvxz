WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:03.235
- Nathan, I love you so much.

00:03.304 --> 00:06.171
- Let's do this thing.
- What?

00:06.306 --> 00:08.840
- Let's get married.
I'm trying to grow old with you.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.578
(exhales)
- oh, my god!

00:12.713 --> 00:14.112
I know that guy!
- What?!

00:14.148 --> 00:16.147
- It's like my old best friend
from high school.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.816
- Are you kidding me right now?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.585
You didn't recognize that
from the file?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.219
Stop! Gtpd!

00:21.989 --> 00:23.021
(thudding)

00:24.258 --> 00:26.859
- Jake mardy,
you're under arrest.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.795
- We know that
you're a replicant.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.596
We know that krish is your boss.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.332
What we don't know...

00:34.235 --> 00:35.768
Is how big this thing is,

00:35.903 --> 00:37.969
Or who's making the drugs.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.539
If you cooperate,

00:40.674 --> 00:43.208
I could patch you out
as a confidential informant,

00:43.210 --> 00:44.943
And you can help us get krish.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.478
- I thought we were having
a meeting?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.479
- Yeah...

00:48.549 --> 00:50.916
- Hey, koi chick.
Nice kicks. Beetroot.

00:50.985 --> 00:54.886
- Yeah, good eye.
You, uh... Must be
a sneakerhead.

00:54.922 --> 00:55.954
- Yeah, a little bit.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.556
Picked up
the grateful 3s last week.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.924
- Nice.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.559
(intriguing music)

01:16.844 --> 01:18.776
(inaudible conversation)

01:23.017 --> 01:25.917
- Attaboy, jake.
He's buying it.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.662
(engine starting)

01:37.998 --> 01:39.197
(engine starting)

01:48.876 --> 01:50.809
(tires screeching)

02:00.954 --> 02:02.321
- It's not fine.
- It's fine!

02:02.456 --> 02:03.955
- Is he here yet?

02:03.991 --> 02:05.290
- Not yet.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.292
When'd you last see him?

02:07.294 --> 02:10.895
- He met up with krish
and then he got into a black suv
headed south on ossington.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.764
- You know what? I don't blame
him for dragging his feet,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.833
Because if someone, meaning you,
had told me that this place

02:14.968 --> 02:17.435
Was riddled with bedbugs,
I would be taking my time.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.571
- They said the bedbug issue
was resolved.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.173
- Is a bedbug issue
ever resolved?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.141
- And what if he's playing us,
huh? Is this him, like,

02:23.144 --> 02:24.977
Trying to get back at me
or something like that?

02:25.112 --> 02:26.211
(knocking)

02:26.346 --> 02:28.247
- Okay, this is him.
Just calm down.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.114
(knocking)
okay! Geez!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.456
- Well, I hope
no one followed me,

02:37.458 --> 02:40.558
'cause anyone who knows me
knows I would never step
in a place this sketch.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.994
- Oh, yeah? Speaking of sketch,
who was driving the black yukon?

02:43.030 --> 02:45.463
- It's called a uber xl,
the opposite of sketch.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.532
You told me to keep up the game
as if nothing's changed.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.667
I don't do public transit,
I don't do uber pool.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.936
- Oh, I wouldn't if I was you

02:51.005 --> 02:51.737
Because of the... Ugh...
(sighing)

02:51.872 --> 02:53.005
- Okay, so I'm a snitch now,

02:53.007 --> 02:54.072
What does that mean? I'm...

02:54.141 --> 02:56.441
I start spilling stuff
to you guys?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.742
Betraying the people
I care about

02:57.778 --> 02:59.077
In order to save my own ass?

02:59.113 --> 03:01.079
That about it?
- You're an idiot.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.148
You're hanging on to old high
school resentments over here?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.284
It's time to let go, brother,
'cause I didn't snitch on you.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.285
- Oh, you're not a snitch.
You're a narc.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.720
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.223
Are you two gonna do this
all day, or can we focus?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.958
What did you tell krish?

03:13.027 --> 03:15.627
- I told him there had been
a gas leak at yoyo's garage,

03:15.762 --> 03:17.495
I'd pick up the stash later.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.631
He bought it... I think.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.433
Said he's, um...
Pivoting operations.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.069
Selling online's
too risky right now,
so he's changing it up.

03:26.506 --> 03:27.973
- Changing it how?

03:28.042 --> 03:31.243
- Uh... Said he's going back
to his promoter roots,

03:31.245 --> 03:34.246
Hosting a sample night,
exclusive kind of thing.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.148
Woo a few guys he knows,
line up...

03:36.150 --> 03:38.450
New dealers with
solid distro track records.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.718
- When?
- Friday night.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.718
- Can you get us in?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.520
- How am I supposed
to get you in there?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.322
He thinks you're
a couple of fish ladies.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.991
- Oh.
- Eh...

03:45.993 --> 03:47.726
(naz): Can you get me in?
- Oh yeah, maybe.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.394
If anyone would ever believe

03:49.396 --> 03:50.829
A geek like you
would be selling drugs.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.531
- Right, 'cause koi-loving,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.599
Manga-reading gamers
sell drugs.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.867
- Stop! Just making sure,

03:55.903 --> 03:58.070
Will they be selling drugs
at this place?

03:58.205 --> 04:00.605
- At the drug sampling party?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.407
Yeah.
- Fair.

04:03.677 --> 04:07.346
- In little baggies like this.
Like a kilo's worth.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.947
- Where is it happening?
- This place called scooters.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.484
- Scooters? Do you mean like
the roller-skating rink?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.086
Oh my gosh, oh, oh!

04:14.088 --> 04:16.021
You guys are... Badass.
(laughing)

04:16.090 --> 04:17.989
- Yeah, I don't think
we can handle that.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.425
- Oh, I'm quivering
in my roller skates!

04:20.560 --> 04:22.928
- You guys are hilarious.
I'll tell you what, nazzy...

04:23.063 --> 04:24.896
I'll get you in there.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.831
And if you convince krish
you're a dealer,

04:26.867 --> 04:29.768
I'll, uh... I'll eat my shorts.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.836
(disco music)

04:36.844 --> 04:40.579
- You know what?
I think in a former life,
I worked with fish, like jen.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.181
- Oh, she was actually
asking about you.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.183
Mm-hmm! So you may have done

04:45.252 --> 04:46.918
What many have tried
and failed to do.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.252
She may not actually hate you.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.722
- Yes, told ya!

04:50.857 --> 04:53.258
- Morning, ro.
- Hey, steve.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.062
So, how's that case going
anyway? The koi-boy drug dealer?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.398
- Like, really good!
Or not, like, good,
'cause it's about drugs,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.866
But purple rain is something
like we've never seen,
it's pretty scary,

05:01.935 --> 05:03.468
But we are making
some headway, so...

05:03.470 --> 05:04.736
- Oh, wish we were.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.538
This daigle case is slamming us.

05:06.607 --> 05:10.808
Ro, did you get a chance
to review the crown's
disclosure package?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.410
- Keep it at the office, steve.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.080
- Why? You're talking shop.
- Not my shop.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.015
I'm talking to your wife
about her shop.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.217
- Well, sam will find this
interesting too. Sweetie...

05:19.219 --> 05:21.386
Look at these cctv captures.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.855
They're inside her bedroom.
That's not admissible.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.490
It's like doing a search
without a warrant.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.826
- Okay, seriously?
You're gonna have my ear

05:27.895 --> 05:29.494
At the office in an hour.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.896
Right now, I'm here to have
coffee with your wife.

05:31.965 --> 05:36.101
'cause unlike you,
I am actually interested in sam.

05:36.170 --> 05:40.105
How she's doing, her cases,
what she's been up to.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.807
- Wow.
(sniffles)

05:45.212 --> 05:46.644
Okay...

05:57.391 --> 05:58.956
See you at the office.
- Bye.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.294
- Bye!
- Oh, my god.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.396
What's wrong with you guys?
What was that about?

06:04.465 --> 06:07.865
- I'm sorry. He's just
so annoying sometimes.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.134
- Well...
- It's like he's always

06:09.203 --> 06:12.003
Inserting himself right
in the middle of your story.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.706
Like, every time.
And then you seem okay with it,

06:14.775 --> 06:16.608
Which is equally weird.
(sam stammers)

06:16.743 --> 06:18.410
You know who you need?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.445
Dr. Neil. Dr. Neil.
(clears throat)

06:20.580 --> 06:23.215
The best couples therapist in
the city! He's a magician.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.349
- Well, I just feel like
I don't know if I need the...

06:25.386 --> 06:26.417
Like, if we need therapy.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.685
- Trust me, you do.
- Okay.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.254
(phone buzzing)

06:31.258 --> 06:32.691
Call him?
- Yeah.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.025
- Promise, promise, promise.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.361
And then use my name,
'cause you'll jump the waitlist.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.130
Call him!
- Yeah, calling.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.366
- Hey!

06:41.368 --> 06:43.367
(rhythmic music playing)

06:51.345 --> 06:53.578
(laughing)

06:53.713 --> 06:55.714
- So, who else knows
you're getting married?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.982
- Uh, just a few family members.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.818
- Is it a secret?
- Kinda.

06:59.953 --> 07:04.456
We got a lot of things
going on at work, so we're just
trying to keep it low-key.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.524
- I'm honoured to be
in the inner circle.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.226
Oh, and speaking of,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.861
I was telling
the black sistah circle

07:09.897 --> 07:12.130
How I'm living with not one,
but two cops,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.866
And everyone's kind of giving me
grief, so can I ask a favour?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.135
- You want me to come down and
show 'em I don't have fangs?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.204
(chuckling)
- the circle's a safe space

07:19.273 --> 07:20.505
For women, so...

07:20.640 --> 07:22.807
I was thinking
more like... Kelly?

07:23.477 --> 07:24.943
We have leticia horne,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.578
This amazing transformative
justice facilitator

07:26.647 --> 07:28.880
Coming this afternoon,
and I think it could be cool

07:28.949 --> 07:31.549
To get a black female cop's
perspective on things.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.888
- Wow, yeah. I'm happy
to come and represent.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.891
Now just... Tell me where
and when, and I'm in.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.092
- Cool.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.027
(rhythmic music continues)

07:43.063 --> 07:44.228
- Ooh!

07:45.399 --> 07:47.031
Ah, ah!

07:51.472 --> 07:52.704
- Okay, so tonight at scooters,

07:52.706 --> 07:54.439
I'm gonna get jake
to introduce you and naz

07:54.441 --> 07:56.308
As two dealers
from out of town.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.343
- I'm not so sure naz should be
in the mix on this play.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.914
- Hey! You need me.
I know this guy, he trusts me.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.851
- Like I said, I'm not sure.
- Come on, look...

08:06.920 --> 08:09.020
I'm the one who got this guy
to agree to do this thing

08:09.155 --> 08:10.454
In the first place, alright?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.724
I promised I'd be there,
I gotta follow through.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.859
- Okay, okay. But I'm taking
the lead on this one.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.928
- Totally fine.
Let's head over to the motel

08:16.997 --> 08:18.796
And jake will help us
build out the uc play.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.598
Just, uh, use the bathrooms
here first.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.400
- This is not the place
you all were at yes--

08:22.402 --> 08:23.668
- Yep.
- No, no!

08:23.704 --> 08:26.204
Kelly had to take
several boiling showers.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.006
Let's just do it somewhere else.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.474
- The room's not that bad.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.610
- Okay, so any idea
how we're gonna get in?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.280
- Yep! Krish and I...

08:35.415 --> 08:37.148
Are viewpix friends.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.217
I hit him up right after
he told me he liked my shoes.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.286
When we were installing
that koi pond.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.820
- Hmm...

08:42.856 --> 08:44.823
- And based on his feed,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.024
I know exactly
where to find him.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.061
(indistinct chatter)

08:50.097 --> 08:51.996
Who did they invite
to that party?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.966
- God.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.701
I should've went home
and changed.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.803
- What, into your mom jeans
and a crop top?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.272
- Mom jeans are totally in,
by the way.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.707
- Yeah, for people
who aren't moms.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.175
(phone chimes, buzzes)

09:04.177 --> 09:06.711
- Oh look, dr. Neil,
couples counselor extraordinaire

09:06.846 --> 09:08.446
Confirming our first
appointment.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.714
- I thought you and steve
were good.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.048
(gasps)
wait!

09:11.084 --> 09:12.584
Is this because you've been
getting those fuzzy wuzzies

09:12.586 --> 09:14.386
For naz every once in a while?
- Stop it!

09:14.388 --> 09:16.054
- Cravings in your belly
for naz in your bed?

09:16.123 --> 09:17.588
- It has nothing to do with naz.

09:17.624 --> 09:21.059
No, it's because ro
thought it would be good
for steve... And me.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.928
She says that he keeps
inserting himself into my story,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.463
Whatever that means,
I don't really know.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.732
- Okay, it sounds like ro
keeps inserting her own self
into your story

09:27.734 --> 09:29.400
And needs to mind
her own business.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.736
Oh, wow, I wonder
what that feels like.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.304
- Oh, ha-ha-ha. Listen,
I learned my lesson,

09:33.340 --> 09:35.940
I will never interfere
into your life again.
Unless you need me to.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.075
Or unless I think that
I really need to and...

09:38.111 --> 09:40.412
- No, I don't. Because I'm good.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.646
- Jesus, you are really good.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.414
(snapping fingers)
- pretty, pretty, pretty good.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.417
- Can you tell me why it's good?
Can you tell me why?

09:45.552 --> 09:47.018
- I'm not gonna tell you
why it's good!

09:47.020 --> 09:49.220
- Not that I'm inserting myself.
- Oh, wait, wait.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.156
Yo! What's up, krish?
- Look who it is.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.225
- Looks like you have
a long line to wait in, brah.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.160
- Good thing I got a friend
holding my spot.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.096
- Oh! Respect, okay!

09:59.132 --> 10:00.832
- Hey.
- Oh, you remember my partner?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.634
- Fish lady.
- Yeah.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.035
- Sensible footwear.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.437
- Oh, look. Yes, it's like a
marshmallow's hugging my foot.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.239
(laughing)
- I can see that.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.708
- Yo, I've been waiting
for these to drop for weeks.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.043
Hoping I can get two pairs.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.712
I just gotta check on
my shmoney real quick.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.249
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.518
No way!
- What? What?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.654
- Man!

10:22.656 --> 10:25.657
A payment came out of my account
that I forgot all about. Shoot!

10:25.659 --> 10:27.659
- Oh...
- Now I can't get 'em.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.127
- The fish business
isn't booming?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.195
- I mean, it is if you want
to wear shoes like mine,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.663
Just not if you want to wear

10:32.699 --> 10:33.965
Shoes like hers.
- Right.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.666
(sighs)
- ah, man.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.001
I'm sick and tired

10:37.070 --> 10:38.336
Of living this straight
and narrow lifestyle.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.405
Can we please just get back
in the game just for a bit?

10:40.474 --> 10:41.806
- Shh. Tss-tss-tss!
- A little bit?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.141
Please, you were so good
at it, though.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.442
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.277
- And what game is that?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.681
- Well, let's just say
I got a lot of friends,

10:49.750 --> 10:53.150
And most of my friends
are some... Serious partiers,

10:53.186 --> 10:55.553
If you know what I'm saying.
- I know what you mean, yeah.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.021
- But never mind.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.156
Guess I can't get the shoes,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.690
And I have to live vicariously
through your feet.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.159
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, take my spot, alright?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.794
Ugh!
- Thank you.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.361
I'll see you around.

11:04.398 --> 11:05.697
- So bummed!

11:07.167 --> 11:09.167
- Alright. Take care.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.303
- It just, like, right...
Just came out of my account!
Just like that!

11:12.305 --> 11:13.771
What?!
- Yo, kelly!

11:14.708 --> 11:15.840
One sec.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.043
- What's up?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.846
- Listen, not that I want
to steer you away

11:21.981 --> 11:23.581
From your righteous path,
or anything.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.516
- Oh, please, steer away.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.852
- So, I got this thing tonight.
You should come by.

11:27.987 --> 11:31.789
Might be able to present you
with some opportunities to, uh,
step up your sneaker game.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.192
- Mmm... Okay! Wait...

11:35.128 --> 11:36.527
Her too, right?

11:36.563 --> 11:37.995
- She's too straight edge.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.599
- That's why nobody expects her
to be such a shady bitch!

11:42.869 --> 11:44.468
- Alright, if you say so,
bring her.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.337
- Ah! Yeah!

11:46.406 --> 11:48.873
- Tonight, scooters vip
on me, okay?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.374
- Right! Vip?
- Of course.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.543
- Vip!
- I'll see you there.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.611
(exclaiming)

11:57.350 --> 11:58.816
- So I'm a shady bitch?

11:58.852 --> 12:01.352
- Oh, but you're such
a loveable one!

12:01.421 --> 12:02.987
(rhythmic music)

12:03.023 --> 12:04.622
- Oh. Wow.
- Hey!

12:04.624 --> 12:06.090
You've been holding out on me!

12:06.159 --> 12:07.291
(laughing)

12:07.327 --> 12:09.093
Where you learn to skate
so good?

12:09.162 --> 12:13.231
- Well, I chalk it up
to perpetual sleeping in. Yes!

12:13.300 --> 12:15.900
(chuckling)
blades saved my ass in college.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.303
(laughing)
- okay!

12:18.438 --> 12:19.771
- Here we go.
- Look at ya.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.038
- Here I come.
- Yeah.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.173
- Oh, dear.
- Come on.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.108
- Oh, snap. Watch out.
You alright?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.709
- I got it.
- Okay, positive reinforcement.

12:25.746 --> 12:26.844
- You're good, you're good.
- Yeah!

12:26.913 --> 12:27.845
- Up top. There it is.

12:27.981 --> 12:28.780
You got this.
- Yes!

12:28.782 --> 12:30.782
- Whoa! Oh my gosh!

12:30.784 --> 12:32.516
(groaning)
- wow.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.919
- Ah, geez.... Whoa!

12:34.921 --> 12:36.221
- This is how you, uh,

12:36.356 --> 12:39.324
Plan to take down our big drug
dealer tonight? With skateski?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.226
- I think I'm ready, guys.
I think I got it.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.560
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.595
- Okay, well,
let's go lay this out.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.997
- Excuse me.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.633
- You guys wanna give me
a push in the...

12:48.702 --> 12:50.535
Just in that general direction,
that would be...

12:50.670 --> 12:52.670
You know what? I have...
I, uh...

12:52.739 --> 12:54.606
You know, I got this,
actually. Here I...

12:54.741 --> 12:56.541
Here I come, drug dealers.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.676
- So...

13:00.213 --> 13:02.947
Our man krish is hosting an
event for potential new dealers

13:02.983 --> 13:05.750
And we believe
he will be handing out
sample packs of this.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.552
So we will be there
to watch it happen,

13:07.621 --> 13:10.221
Gather more evidence,
and see how far this drug is
actually reaching.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.723
- Wait, wait.
We're just gonna let this guy

13:11.725 --> 13:13.391
Hand this stuff out
at the party?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.027
Then what, it's out on the
street? How's that a good play?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.362
- Yeah, that's what
we're gonna do,

13:17.364 --> 13:19.230
We're just gonna sit back
and watch them hand out drugs.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.464
- That's what I'm wondering.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.367
- Which is why we have these.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.769
Now, before the event,
we'll do a controlled swap.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.407
Replace the real drugs
with these lookalikes.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.210
What, watts?

13:32.279 --> 13:34.078
- Uh, well, what if the dealers

13:34.080 --> 13:35.713
Want to sample on the spot?
- Are you kidding me?

13:35.749 --> 13:38.516
Do you know how much caffeine is
in this stuff?

13:38.585 --> 13:41.252
If they want a mini-dose,
they'll definitely be buzzing.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.122
- And chase will go in early
to find out where he's hiding
the real drugs.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.657
Kelly will do the switch out.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.725
- Meanwhile, nathan and I will
be hanging out with krish.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.660
What, watts?

13:49.696 --> 13:51.262
- Uh, how?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.531
- Our ci's making
an introduction.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.867
We're dealers from montreal,
making a big buy

13:55.936 --> 13:58.535
And maybe hopefully find out
who's making this stuff.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.339
- And in the meantime,
I'm gonna suss out who the
real invited dealers are

14:01.408 --> 14:02.740
And put them
in the database.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.541
- Right! Badges.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.011
(sighs)

14:10.350 --> 14:13.751
- Alright. I gotta go meet up
with tueli.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.020
I'll see you guys at the rink
before the party.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.022
Wish me luck
with these activists.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.290
- They're gonna love you.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.360
- Aw... Doesn't everybody?
(clicks tongue)

14:22.429 --> 14:24.562
- Okay, let's get
this party started!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.297
- Alright!

14:28.435 --> 14:30.067
(all shouting)
- hey!

14:33.073 --> 14:35.640
- What do you think
your community needs?

14:37.176 --> 14:38.443
Miss peggs?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.843
- Thank you, leticia.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.981
My brother's neighbourhood
invites professionals

14:42.983 --> 14:44.849
To volunteer their time.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.451
- Mmm, what kind?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.986
- Lawyers will talk
about what to do

14:49.122 --> 14:50.187
If you've been scammed,

14:50.257 --> 14:52.723
And accountants advise
on how to stretch your money.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.660
That kind of thing.
- Great! What else?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.328
- Overdose prevention.
(all exclaiming)

14:57.463 --> 14:58.595
- Yeah! Okay.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.531
- Yeah, the province gives out
free narcan kits,

15:00.600 --> 15:03.001
So maybe we could bring
in a local pharmacist
and do some training.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.337
- Okay, so sounds like
we're rethinking what
public safety looks like.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.075
- Uh, how about a safety audit?

15:11.144 --> 15:15.546
Like checking in on the elderly,
especially those who live alone.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.482
Making sure the streetlights,
park lights,

15:18.551 --> 15:21.152
And security cameras
are all working properly.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.687
(overlapping chatter)
- that is so true.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.089
The lights leading up to my
apartment are always out,

15:25.091 --> 15:26.991
And I don't come home
from work 'til dark.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.559
- And how about
a safety walk program?

15:28.561 --> 15:31.429
- Hmm.
- You text us when you're close,

15:31.498 --> 15:34.064
We meet you at your transit stop
and get you to your doorstep.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.466
- That's good.
- That is perfect.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.502
- We? Are you volunteering?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.704
- Absolutely.
(chuckling)

15:39.839 --> 15:41.906
I'll even wrangle
some of my colleagues to help.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.976
- Okay, colleagues?
That's great. Where do you work?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.045
- I'm a police officer
with guns and gangs.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.746
- What?!
(scoffs)

15:49.549 --> 15:51.215
You've got to be kidding me.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.718
I didn't come here
to talk to no cop.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.388
- This is supposed
to be private, safe!

15:57.390 --> 15:58.589
I don't feel safe.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.624
- What are you doing here?
- Um...

16:01.594 --> 16:03.494
I invited her.
I asked kelly to join us

16:03.563 --> 16:05.663
Because she's an amazing woman.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.900
And yes, she's a cop, but she--
- thank you, tueli.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.671
As you can tell,
there's some concerns here
about your presence.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.808
Obviously, what we're discussing
here does not leave this room.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.477
- Absolutely. Of course.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.278
- Good.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.482
(sighs)

16:35.895 --> 16:38.363
- Let's go, come on.
(dog barking)

16:38.498 --> 16:41.165
Good dog. This way.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.600
(indistinct chatter)

16:42.735 --> 16:44.168
- It's a big night,
alright? Yeah.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.503
- Hi.
- Hey,

16:45.505 --> 16:47.237
We're closed tonight
for a private event, okay?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.507
- Oh, no, I'm the fire inspector
with the city.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.942
- Oh.
- You the owner?

16:51.077 --> 16:52.777
- Uh, no, I'm not.
He's out of town.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.844
I'm just renting it
for the night,

16:53.913 --> 16:55.379
So come back tomorrow, okay?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.848
- Yeah, that's... That's not
how surprise drop-in
code checks work.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.917
(scoffs)
- look, what's it gonna take

17:00.053 --> 17:03.054
For me to get you
and your cute doggo out of here?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.656
- Ah-ah-ta-ta! Ajax is my
emotional support dog,

17:05.792 --> 17:08.292
You are not allowed
to pet him. Okay?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.294
- What can I do for you?

17:10.296 --> 17:12.663
- I just need to make sure
that the exits are clear

17:12.732 --> 17:15.132
And that the fire detectors and
extinguishers are in good order.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.600
Shouldn't take long at all.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.369
Thank you.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.175
(whining)

17:25.244 --> 17:27.311
Oh, oh, oh, okay!
(chuckling)

17:28.281 --> 17:29.279
(barks)

17:29.315 --> 17:31.615
- Hey, can I help you
with something? I...

17:31.651 --> 17:33.584
- Yeah, I just...
I need a visual inside any room

17:33.719 --> 17:35.153
With a locked door.
- That one? Re--

17:35.288 --> 17:36.687
- Yes, this one.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.355
- Okay. Just give me a sec.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.991
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.225
(sighs)

17:52.038 --> 17:53.771
- Alright, go ahead,
take a look.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.239
- Thank you, appreciate it.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.174
- It's all good, right? Yeah.
(barking)

17:57.243 --> 17:59.110
- Okay, everything seems
to be in good order,

17:59.112 --> 18:00.511
There's just a few more
rooms down there,

18:00.547 --> 18:02.313
And I'll be out of your hair.
- Alright, let's go.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.248
- Ah-ta-ta-ta!
Do not touch the dog.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.384
- Right, of course. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.287
(sighs)

18:11.124 --> 18:12.723
(phone buzzing)

18:13.460 --> 18:14.859
- Hey.
- Hey, hun.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.128
You gonna be home for dinner?
- No, I'm gonna be late.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.829
- How's your work going?
Anything exciting?

18:18.865 --> 18:21.265
<i>Anything you want to talk about?</i>
<i> Because I'm all ears.</i>

18:21.301 --> 18:22.800
- Uh, you know what? It's fine.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.403
We don't have to talk about
my work. Listen, I'm a cop,

18:25.538 --> 18:27.071
So most of it
is confidential anyway.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.139
<i> - Sam, please.</i>

18:28.141 --> 18:29.574
Tell me the truth.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.543
Am I a horrible mansplainer?

18:33.646 --> 18:37.414
- You're not like
a horrible mansplainer...

18:37.450 --> 18:39.550
- But I'm a mansplainer.
<i> - You're just like...</i>

18:39.685 --> 18:43.087
You're like a "splainer"
that happens to be a man.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.022
Listen, I love you.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.959
It's... It's no big deal, okay?
We're good.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.561
- I'm still making dinner
for you whenever you get home,

18:50.563 --> 18:52.563
<i> And I'm gonna show you</i>
<i> that I'm very interested</i>

18:52.599 --> 18:54.398
<i> In your very interesting job.</i>

18:54.534 --> 18:57.635
- Yeah, that's very interesting.
Listen, uh, I gotta go. Bye.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.170
(phone ringing)

19:01.107 --> 19:02.573
<i> Hey, how'd it go?</i>

19:02.575 --> 19:04.175
- Worked like a charm.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.710
Ajax's nose never lies.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.579
Top of his canine
drug detecting class.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.182
And according to ajax, the stash
is in the utility closet

19:11.184 --> 19:12.583
To the right of the washrooms.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.853
The code is 8-0-0-8-1-3-5.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.590
<i> - Okay, kelly's gonna be</i>
<i> here soon,</i>

19:19.725 --> 19:21.325
<i> She's got the fake stuff</i>
<i> with her.</i>

19:21.327 --> 19:22.927
She'll be able to do
a quick swap out.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.861
- Great.
- Okay.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.897
(wheezing laughter)

19:26.933 --> 19:29.233
- What?
- Boobies?

19:30.336 --> 19:35.072
8-0-0-8-1-3-5 is "boobies".

19:35.141 --> 19:36.807
(laughing)

19:36.943 --> 19:39.009
- Boobies, right, yeah.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.945
No, that's amazing, for sure.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.613
- That's so good!

19:44.317 --> 19:47.218
- Look, it's easier to stay
as close to the truth
as possible.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.487
There's less room to screw up.
Just never use our real names.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.722
- Okay.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.359
How about... Knee job?

19:56.162 --> 19:57.795
- Okay, don't call me that.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.031
- What's knee job?
- Eh...

20:00.033 --> 20:01.632
- Oh, in high school...
- Yeah...

20:01.668 --> 20:04.167
- He lost his v-card
to heather peterson's knee.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.103
- That's not... What went down.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.172
- Ah, uh, uh, uh... Back up.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.241
What happened with
heather peterson's knee?

20:10.243 --> 20:12.810
- Let's just say
a romantic gesture,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.511
Typically done
by the hand...

20:14.581 --> 20:16.447
Heather did with her knee.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.315
Now, either she had
serious skills,

20:18.384 --> 20:20.050
Or knee job was good to go.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.052
- That's quite enough of that,
alright?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.922
Nathan and I... Are big noise.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.257
- Yeah, I got it.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.126
Club promoters,
montreal, having a rave.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.661
- Jake.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.529
We need krish to buy our cover.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.331
You need to take this seriously.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.300
- Oh, I'm serious.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.535
Like, "I don't want to wind up
dead if krish finds out

20:38.605 --> 20:40.404
I double-crossed him" serious.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.442
- Looks like some distributors
are already here.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.679
- We better get going,
big noise.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.685
(intriguing music)

20:59.125 --> 21:01.458
(sam): Damn.
Everyone's ahead of schedule.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.636
Oh, my god, kel,
why won't you pick up?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.838
Listen, the dealers
are here early.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.908
I really hope that
you're on your way.
I'm going in.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.184
- Alright, kelly.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.252
230.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.221
Know the significance
of that number?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.459
- Police here are 230 percent
more likely to pull the gun

21:35.528 --> 21:37.594
On an unarmed black person
than a white person.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.263
- Mmm, and then what?

21:39.265 --> 21:40.798
You're expected to just go
along your merry way

21:40.867 --> 21:42.632
As if nothing happened.

21:44.136 --> 21:48.405
Do you know how much it costs to
fund the police force annually?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.273
- About a billion dollars.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.943
- If we could take a tiny bit
of that money,

21:52.945 --> 21:54.878
Put it back into
community supports,

21:54.914 --> 21:57.481
We could have a sustainable
crime prevention model.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.483
Cops need to be removed
from schools.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.219
And nurses and psychologists
reinstated.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.353
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.755
- But...
(sighs)

22:05.591 --> 22:08.024
Not all cops are bad apples.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.495
There are good ones, like me,

22:11.564 --> 22:13.463
Doing good work.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.700
- But if the tree's rotten,

22:16.769 --> 22:19.837
Even the good apples
will hold some of its poison.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.405
- Oh!
- Hm.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.039
- Please, kelly.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.476
I'm not picking on you
as an individual.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.244
You seem to care.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.047
It's the institution
you work for I have issue with.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.650
So, back to you.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.920
We appreciate your offer,

22:36.956 --> 22:39.123
A walk safe program
with your colleagues.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.957
No thanks.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.326
- I... I hear you.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.262
I really do.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.397
(phone chimes, buzzing)

22:46.532 --> 22:47.998
Mmm, that's my colleague
texting.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.667
Sorry, I gotta get to work.

22:50.469 --> 22:51.601
- You okay, kelly?

22:55.942 --> 22:57.140
- Honey...

22:58.077 --> 22:59.609
How could you go
out there tonight,

22:59.645 --> 23:01.345
Put yourself in the line of fire

23:01.414 --> 23:03.647
For a system that doesn't care
about your people?

23:05.084 --> 23:06.417
- Sis...

23:06.419 --> 23:09.553
I'm doing
the best I can, okay?

23:13.692 --> 23:15.992
(disco music)

23:18.564 --> 23:20.631
(indistinct chatter)

23:24.437 --> 23:27.971
- If this wasn't a purple rain
do, this would be amazing.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.406
- Yeah.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.910
(indistinct chatter)

23:35.381 --> 23:37.614
(cheering, laughing)

23:46.192 --> 23:47.390
- So, you know who's who here?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.461
- Yeah, that's tommy.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.798
He owns the serpent room
down on queen.

23:53.933 --> 23:57.601
He's unpredictable,
but has a... Solid clientele.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.605
And over there with
the short hair and the jacket,

24:01.740 --> 24:03.541
That's, uh, lil lish.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.808
She's pretty cool, actually.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.077
Hosts these retro
video dance parties.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.451
(inaudible conversation)

24:18.124 --> 24:20.024
(phone ringing, buzzing)

24:21.894 --> 24:22.960
- Shoot.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.895
<i> - Where are you? Listen,</i>

24:24.931 --> 24:26.463
<i> We need to switch out</i>
<i> those drugs now,</i>

24:26.532 --> 24:28.699
<i> Krish is handing out</i>
<i> the real stuff.</i>

24:28.768 --> 24:30.468
- I'm almost there,
can you stall him?

24:30.603 --> 24:31.969
- Yeah, well...

24:32.038 --> 24:33.904
(indistinct chatter)

24:33.906 --> 24:37.041
(stammering)
yes. Cool. I'll try. Yes.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.642
- Okay, thanks.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.610
(disco music continues)

24:53.359 --> 24:55.526
- Alright. No slowing down,

24:55.528 --> 24:57.728
Let's keep it going,
let's keep it going.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.163
- Crap!

25:08.140 --> 25:10.140
- We gotta keep these moving
today, alright?

25:10.943 --> 25:12.910
(indistinct chatter)

25:15.014 --> 25:17.281
If you need more, let me know.
- Help, I can't stop!

25:17.283 --> 25:19.817
(grunting)
- whoa!

25:19.952 --> 25:21.018
- What the hell?!

25:21.153 --> 25:23.153
(groaning)
- I should've worn my helmet.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.957
(phone chimes, buzzes)

25:27.026 --> 25:29.093
- Ugh, sam,
I said I'd be there soon.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.366
(siren wailing)
shoot.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.746
(indistinct radio
police chatter)

25:52.885 --> 25:54.317
(sighs)

25:55.555 --> 25:57.988
- Hands where I can see them.
- Yep.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.691
Is there a problem, officer?

26:02.795 --> 26:05.729
- Yeah, that.
Cell phone use while driving.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.999
- My bad. I won't...
It won't happen again. Look...

26:09.068 --> 26:11.835
I'm a cop.
- Okay, let me see your badge.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.939
- Oh, shoot.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.208
Look, I'm uc right now,
so it's with my handlers.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.878
My name's kelly duff, b4601.
Call it in.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.347
- Anybody could
spew out numbers.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.350
- Call it in. I'm kind of
in the middle of a play here.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.018
- Did you hear that, maccleary?
- What?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.820
- She's in the middle of a play.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.057
- What do we got here? Drugs.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.294
It's that purple stuff
we've been seeing on campus.

26:38.331 --> 26:40.264
- Get out of the car.
- Whoa, whoa.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.299
- Get out of the car!
- Alright. I'm unarmed.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.438
I'm just reaching
to undo my seatbelt, okay?

26:47.573 --> 26:49.139
- Get out.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.974
Walk towards me.
- Alright.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.909
- Walk towards me.
- Just take it easy. Okay.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.714
- Keep coming.
Keep coming. Stop.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.548
You got her?
- Yeah, I got her.

27:01.120 --> 27:01.985
- Sir, this is...

27:03.155 --> 27:05.589
Take it easy!
- Get on the ground! Get down!

27:05.724 --> 27:07.658
- Ah! Ah!

27:07.793 --> 27:09.660
- Do you have a gun?
- No!

27:09.795 --> 27:11.327
Officer,
you're making a mistake!

27:11.364 --> 27:12.262
- Shut your mouth.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.732
- Detective kelly duff. B4--

27:14.867 --> 27:16.933
- I said shut it!
- Detective kelly duff!

27:16.969 --> 27:19.002
- I said shut it!
- B4601!

27:19.071 --> 27:20.604
- Shh! Find anything?

27:20.739 --> 27:23.340
- Just call it in!
- Did you find a gun?

27:23.475 --> 27:26.009
- No, car's clean.
- I'm 44 division.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.612
B460... 1.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.948
- Maybe we should call it in.
- Go ahead.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.152
- I need to run a check
on uc officer badge b4601.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.586
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:38.257 --> 27:39.556
- What do you got?

27:39.692 --> 27:42.025
- She is who she says she is.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.493
(groaning)

27:45.831 --> 27:47.231
(coughing)
- let me get you up there.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.332
Let's get--
- off me! Get off me!

27:53.372 --> 27:55.172
- You know the job, right?

27:55.241 --> 27:57.707
We can't be too careful.
There's a lot of dangerous
people on the streets.

27:57.743 --> 27:58.976
(coughing)

27:59.111 --> 28:00.444
- Yeah, I see that.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.581
- I'm sorry, detective, I was
just following the evidence.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.316
- I got both your numbers.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.254
(car door slams)

28:17.196 --> 28:18.862
(brakes squealing)

28:26.539 --> 28:28.338
(breathing heavily)

28:33.212 --> 28:34.611
(sighing)

28:34.613 --> 28:36.279
(groans)

28:42.087 --> 28:45.089
(panting)
(banging)

28:46.558 --> 28:48.925
(disco music)

28:51.296 --> 28:53.630
(indistinct chatter)

28:57.770 --> 28:59.435
Hey, what's going on?

28:59.472 --> 29:01.238
- Oh, my god. You're so late,
what happened?

29:01.307 --> 29:03.373
- Yeah, I... I got held up.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.608
- What's this?

29:07.446 --> 29:10.914
- Never mind me. Whoa.
What happened to you?

29:11.049 --> 29:12.549
- Nothing. My head...

29:12.684 --> 29:14.518
I mean, nothing.
But... I got this.

29:14.587 --> 29:17.120
- Good. Where's the room?
- This way.

29:19.725 --> 29:22.159
The drugs should be
somewhere in here.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.860
(beeping)

29:23.896 --> 29:26.629
Code word's "boobies".
(laughing)

29:28.400 --> 29:29.866
Boobies!

29:33.139 --> 29:35.072
Get it? Boobs.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.014
(grunts)

29:54.493 --> 29:56.125
- Come on, come on.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.767
Oh...

30:07.840 --> 30:09.439
Mm-hmm.

30:26.559 --> 30:27.724
Huh?

30:32.130 --> 30:33.330
(shutter clicking)

30:33.465 --> 30:35.265
(sam): Hey, krish!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

30:35.301 --> 30:37.701
(krish): Hey, hey.
(sam): My man! Boom! Smoke!

30:37.703 --> 30:39.068
Yes! How are you?

30:39.104 --> 30:40.904
I just wanted to tell you...
- Yeah.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.605
- ...There's so many cool
people in this place!

30:42.641 --> 30:44.107
Loads of cool people.
Are you having fun?

30:44.109 --> 30:45.676
I'm having fun.
Who's the coolest?

30:45.678 --> 30:47.143
- Having a great time.
Alright, great.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.145
- Yo, krish. Uh...

30:49.815 --> 30:51.014
Come meet big noise,

30:51.083 --> 30:52.282
The promoters
I was telling you about.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.617
- That's right.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.451
That's right, that's right.
Let's go see them.

31:01.594 --> 31:02.826
- All clear.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.162
- I'm gonna hands these
off to watts, okay?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.497
- Okay!
(jake): Yeah, they say they want

31:07.633 --> 31:08.699
To sample the product.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.500
- Alright, makes sense.
Let me go get some, okay?

31:12.338 --> 31:15.171
- Yo, sneaker fish lady!
- Oh, hey! There you go.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.573
Hey, look,
I was looking for you.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.109
Gotta talk business.
- Yo, listen, we will.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.979
I got some people in town
from "la belle province"

31:21.981 --> 31:24.514
So I'm gonna go deal with that,
and then we'll talk.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.383
- Yeah, yeah, okay,
I'm gonna slip these on,
hit the rink.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.383
But find me later, alright?

31:27.419 --> 31:28.652
- Alright, you got it.
I got you.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.687
- Don't forget about me.
- I got you, I got you.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.994
So, which one of you is big
and which one of you is noise?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.861
(chuckling)

31:38.898 --> 31:40.731
- Package deal. One unit.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.932
- And how do y'all know
each other again?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.036
- A mutual acquaintance
connected us.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.471
- Your boy jake here
would not shut up

31:47.606 --> 31:49.205
About your new concoction.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.674
Tell us more.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.944
- It's a proprietary blend.
It's clean.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.080
I get it straight
from the source, so no lacing.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.683
You can use a little,
you can use a lot.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.485
You can simply toss it back.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.387
But what the clubbers love...

32:05.991 --> 32:08.225
The clubbers love this.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.764
The purple rain slammer.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.101
You know, you really should
try it before you buy it.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.838
(exhaling)

32:21.874 --> 32:23.539
(clears throat)

32:29.214 --> 32:30.446
- Mmm.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.317
Yeah, man.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.385
I like the way you do business.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.955
So, uh, how fast
does it, uh... Oh.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.359
- Yeah, that fast.
- Alright.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.496
It takes a lot to impress my boy
here. How much can we get?

32:46.498 --> 32:47.931
- How much do you need?

32:48.066 --> 32:49.799
- Uh, as much as you got.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.270
- Seriously?
- We got a huge rave coming up.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.807
Thinking we can sell shots
to everybody who comes in,

32:56.942 --> 32:59.810
And if our clients are
as impressed as you say
they will be,

32:59.945 --> 33:01.344
We'll need more the next week.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.714
- Talk numbers to me.
- We don't come to play.

33:10.923 --> 33:12.889
- Hey, I don't got any time
for games here, okay?

33:12.925 --> 33:14.290
I got bigger things on my mind.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.027
- Well, you need to give the
guys some room to talk business.

33:17.029 --> 33:20.630
You see, krish likes to talk
<i> mano a mano</i> to the money guy.

33:24.403 --> 33:28.438
- You should be
munching on your shorts, okay?

33:28.573 --> 33:30.507
Because he was totally
buying my dealer act.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.375
- Whatever, knee job.

33:32.444 --> 33:35.178
- You know, jake,
one-on-one, you and I were
always really cool.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.580
The minute anybody else
was around,

33:37.616 --> 33:39.982
You became a real asshole.
(scoffs)

33:40.019 --> 33:41.985
- Well, that's 'cause you
never knew how to take a joke.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.587
- Oh, I could take a joke.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.989
It was the mocking
and the name-calling,

33:47.026 --> 33:48.992
And telling everyone
that my house smelled

33:48.994 --> 33:50.594
Because of my mom's cooking?

33:50.729 --> 33:54.131
That same food that you would
scarf down and thank her for?

33:55.333 --> 33:56.933
How do you think
that made me feel?

33:58.337 --> 34:01.304
- Vengeful.
- Hey, stupid.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.473
I did not snitch on you.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.410
- Well, look, you still
walked out of my life
without looking back.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.679
- Yeah, well, I'm back now.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.082
So you'd better
get the hell used to it.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.389
- I figure we could use
2,000 units this weekend.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.758
- That's a big order.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.293
I have to speak to the prince
about that one.

34:24.329 --> 34:25.629
See what they say.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.032
- Well, maybe a down payment
could help.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.569
Or I could talk to him myself.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.106
- A deposit is always
appreciated.

34:38.209 --> 34:39.776
Let me hook you up.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.778
(disco music)

34:42.981 --> 34:46.449

a heartbeat away, baby ♪

34:46.518 --> 34:48.985

like a cheetah.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.887
I was wondering
if we could just do that, like,
maybe just hold hands...

35:23.956 --> 35:25.622
- Yeah.
- ...While we skate.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.823
- Yeah, sure.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.294
- Oh. Looks like big noise

35:31.330 --> 35:33.262
Is having a big bro party
with krish.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.031
- Yeah.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.234
- I think krish is gonna
totally lead us to the source.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.574
Kel... Is something up?

35:45.377 --> 35:46.643
I don't like to meddle.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.911
- Oh, you don't like
to meddle now?

35:48.947 --> 35:50.714
- I abhor meddlers,
I absolutely despise them.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.716
It's just that this morning,
you used to be on cloud nine,

35:52.851 --> 35:54.584
And now you're on, like,
cloud zero.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.052
I don't even know if that's
a thing, like,

35:56.121 --> 35:57.854
Whatever the opposite
to like, cloud nine is.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.460
- Nathan and I are
getting married.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.163
- What? Are you serious?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.065
When did this... Oh, my god.
Why didn't you tell me?

36:09.134 --> 36:10.733
Kel, this is amazing!
(gasps)

36:10.802 --> 36:12.669
Can I be a bridesmaid?
Because you promised
that I could be.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.004
- Whoa, whoa, slow down, okay?
Just stop.

36:14.139 --> 36:15.939
- I know, I'm just, okay, sorry.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.274
- You know what?

36:17.276 --> 36:19.342
It's fine.
Look, I gotta talk to you later.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.685
- Alright, this is all I've got.

36:29.922 --> 36:30.987
The prince says they're gonna
need a few more days

36:31.056 --> 36:32.888
To get the rest, though.
- Great.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.858
Any chance we're gonna
get to meet the prince?

36:34.993 --> 36:36.425
I mean, rubbing shoulders
with royalty

36:36.461 --> 36:37.627
Sounds pretty sweet to me.

36:37.663 --> 36:40.297
- Nah. Nobody connects
with the prince except for me.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.498
But I'll be in touch. Peace out.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.042
- Hey, a bird in the hand,

36:52.044 --> 36:54.043
So I don't know that he's gonna
give us this prince guy.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.445
- Patience, brother.
He may not give him,

36:55.514 --> 36:56.812
But we're gonna get him.

37:05.524 --> 37:08.524
- Chase and watts delivered
the real purple rain
to the property unit

37:08.560 --> 37:09.926
To be bagged and tagged.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.662
- Mm-hmm. And we bought off
most of the fake purple rain.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.531
- Wait! Stop there. Yeah.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.799
Krish sold some of it
to this guy.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.336
- Tommy from the serpent room.
Mercurial, but a stellar dealer.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.407
- Krish would do whatever it
takes to make our order happen.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.008
His eyes lit up
with dollar signs.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.078
(chuckling)
he said his supplier was called

37:28.080 --> 37:30.680
The prince, and we got a promise
to step up production.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.416
- In the meantime, jake remains
our ear on the ground.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.485
- Look, I also found this.
(sighs)

37:35.487 --> 37:38.821
Krish's stash was
in a hazardous waste bag.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.590
Check out the label.
- Mmm.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.692
- Looks like something
a lab would use, right?

37:42.694 --> 37:45.028
- Dr. Sharma did say
the supplier would be
a chemistry whiz,

37:45.097 --> 37:46.595
So you know,
maybe it's connected.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.998
We'll try
and trace this tomorrow.

37:49.067 --> 37:52.034
- Yeah, um...
Yeah, tomorrow sounds good.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.038
(intriguing music)

38:04.449 --> 38:05.881
(sighs)

38:18.730 --> 38:20.029
- Hey, kel.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.465
- Hey.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.434
- Long day.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.204
You know, we probably both need
some sleep, so I'll just...

38:28.340 --> 38:30.406
I'm gonna get my stuff,
and then I'm gonna go.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.474
- Sam.

38:34.279 --> 38:36.680
I wasn't 100 percent
truthful with you.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.083
Earlier... At the rink.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.554
- Um... Are you not getting
married? Is that the...?

38:44.623 --> 38:45.689
- No, no.
- No?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.289
- It's not that. Um...

38:50.329 --> 38:52.361
Something happened...

38:52.397 --> 38:54.864
Earlier today,
and it was really bad.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.100
Which is why I was late,
but I can't...

38:59.270 --> 39:02.505
I can't talk about it right now,
not yet. Alright?

39:03.709 --> 39:05.441
I just gotta...

39:06.445 --> 39:08.477
I just gotta think it through.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.583
Okay?
- Okay.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.254
- I love you.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.523
- I love you.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.291
(soft music)

39:29.201 --> 39:30.466
(sighs)

39:37.809 --> 39:39.142
Oh, wow.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.878
I didn't know I was hungry
until that smell hit me.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.679
That smells amazing,
what are you...

39:43.715 --> 39:45.281
- Hello.
- ...Doing here?

39:45.283 --> 39:46.849
It's very late.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.253
- Oh, I'll give you ladies
your space. Uh, girls. Women.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.489
(chuckling)

39:53.625 --> 39:54.690
- Hey.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.226
- Let me know
when you're ready to eat.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.360
- Okay.
- Okay?

39:57.495 --> 39:58.428
- Thank you, steve.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.229
- Hey.
- Hello.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.832
So...

40:02.868 --> 40:06.970
I am here to... Celebrate.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.572
I got a motion overturned,
which is a very big deal,

40:09.574 --> 40:11.441
And you're the first person
I wanted to tell.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.709
- Aw...
- Shall I open this?

40:12.711 --> 40:15.779
Oh, and then, hold on,
I also got you this.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.382
- "how to speak so your man will
shut the eff up and listen."

40:19.451 --> 40:21.184
Oh, okay. Well...
- Oh, it's pretty good.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.853
It is a deep dive
into power dynamic.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.722
- I think, um...
Thank you, but um...

40:26.724 --> 40:28.591
No thank you, I'm good.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.861
- Sam, we talked about this.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.863
- Actually, you talked about it,
and frankly, I found it like,

40:33.865 --> 40:35.198
A little bit womansplainy, so...

40:35.734 --> 40:37.066
- Damn.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.269
- Yeah, ro, listen.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.670
I know that you really care

40:40.739 --> 40:42.605
About your friends and
you're super protective

40:42.607 --> 40:45.141
Of like, me and jen,
and you always have the answer,
and normally you do,

40:45.276 --> 40:47.343
But it's just that steve and I,
like, we are really...

40:47.345 --> 40:48.611
We're good.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.415
- Okay, I was trying
to help you,

40:52.417 --> 40:54.217
Because as a friend,
I think that's what--

40:54.286 --> 40:55.918
- I know, and sometimes you can.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.322
Sometimes, you can't.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.764
- So I guess I'm drinking
this bad boy alone?

41:08.766 --> 41:10.633
- Yeah, that's right, you are.
(chuckling)

41:10.669 --> 41:12.835
Because of you,
I promised I was gonna have

41:12.871 --> 41:14.303
This very late dinner
with steve, and afterwards,

41:14.339 --> 41:17.306
He's gonna be so eager to prove
that he cares about

41:17.342 --> 41:19.575
Interesting me
and my interesting feelings,

41:19.644 --> 41:21.311
And like, interesting work.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.412
So, you're gonna down that one
on your own.

41:23.448 --> 41:24.847
- I'm sorry.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.485
Ugh, I'm a terrible friend.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.321
- No, no, you're good.
You're good.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.658
Dinner next week.
- Yes, I would like that.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.195
- You gonna lodge
a formal complaint

41:39.330 --> 41:40.563
Against those assholes?

41:42.868 --> 41:44.267
- Of course I am.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.337
(sighing)
but honestly...

41:49.741 --> 41:52.408
I don't know how much more
of this I can take, nathan.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.845
Nothing ever changes.

41:57.782 --> 42:01.183
This system is... Rotten.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.289
I keep defending it.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.994
How do I get anyone to listen?

42:14.533 --> 42:15.831
- I don't know.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.270
I do know this.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.174
If anybody can do it...

42:26.912 --> 42:27.911
It's you.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.449
Kelly duff can make 'em listen.

42:33.518 --> 42:36.018
(soft music)

43:16.294 --> 43:18.427
Subtitling: Difuze
