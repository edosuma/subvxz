Community Sue,
I'm so sorry, I--

00:39.072 --> 00:42.042
Didn't feel a thing!
Okay, youngsters,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.443
hit the bleachers!

00:43.443 --> 00:46.046
Thank you all for volunteering

00:46.046 --> 00:48.715
for our "Big Buddy,
Lil' Buddy" program

00:48.715 --> 00:52.252
I'm going to pair each of you
with a lil' buddy.

00:52.252 --> 00:57.124
Your job is to make a positive
impact on their mushy,
undeveloped brains!

00:57.124 --> 00:59.660
Who has questions?
Yes, Cricket!

00:59.660 --> 01:01.528
This is for the pizza thing,
right?

01:01.528 --> 01:03.664
We get free pizza
if we're big buddies
or whatever?

01:03.664 --> 01:07.734
At the end of the day
all participants may attend
a pizza party.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.203
-Are there any more--
-Is it from Mama Roni's?

01:10.203 --> 01:11.638
I love Mama Roni's.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.540
[sighs] Yes, Cricket.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.410
But the real reward here
isn't pizza!

01:16.410 --> 01:18.645
It's the chance
to make a lasting--

01:18.645 --> 01:21.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the kids are the future
and all that. Kumbaya.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.151
Aren't you excited
to be a role model, brother?

01:24.151 --> 01:26.320
Yeah, I'm excited to <i>roll</i>

01:26.320 --> 01:28.555
-some pizza into my--
-Mkay.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.159

Wanna see me stick

What, like it's hard?

01:37.531 --> 01:39.533
Check out all the games

01:39.533 --> 01:42.436
Green! I'm pairing you
with Emma here.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.671
Show her some
of that Tilly charm.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.341
How do you do?
I offer a welcoming gift.

I'm your big buddy, Cricket.

Ah! Get off of me!

02:13.567 --> 02:15.102
Sue, I think
my buddy's defective.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.670
You gotta give me another kid!

02:16.670 --> 02:18.639
-Nope! Chase is yours
till three pm.
-But--

02:38.325 --> 02:39.726
What's wrong, Emma?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.795
I wanna put googly eyes
on my painting,

02:41.795 --> 02:43.430
but we ran out of glue.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.365
Ah, not to worry,
little lady,

02:45.365 --> 02:48.235
for the paint provides.
Observe.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.504
[Emma]
Whoa! They stuck
to the wet paint.

02:50.504 --> 02:54.007
Cool! Tilly, you are amazing!

02:54.007 --> 02:56.576
Haha, Emma, you are correct.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.379
Looks like you two
are getting along well!

02:59.379 --> 03:01.515
Cricket! How you doin-- Oh!

-[Remy] Ah! My glasses!

Dangit all, I'm your big buddy,
and that means you gotta
do what I say!

03:09.756 --> 03:13.160
So, you and I are gonna go
back to that table, sit quietly

03:13.160 --> 03:16.763
and think about the pizza
and possibly chicken wings
that await us if we get along.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.331
Whaddya say to that?

-Hi, Cricket.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.982
How's it going
with your lil' buddy?

03:35.982 --> 03:38.685
He refused to sit in time-out,
so I had to fasten him

03:38.685 --> 03:41.421
to a cabinet with a bunch
of pipe cleaners.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.756
I'm completely outmatched.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.624
How'd you train your kid
to be so good?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.293
-Oh, she asked to do this.
-[Emma giggles]

03:46.293 --> 03:48.328
Cricket, the only advice
I can give

03:48.328 --> 03:50.263
is something you know
better than anyone.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.566
Sometimes, the only way
to soothe a wild beast

03:52.566 --> 03:54.034
is by taming its heart.

03:54.034 --> 03:58.472
Whoa. I've gotta
write that one down.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.173
Taming his heart!
What's that even mean?

04:00.173 --> 04:02.175
-Ah, Tilly! You
and your riddle--
-[Chase] Ah!

04:02.175 --> 04:04.077
-[fighting sounds]
-Good luck on your journey,
brother.

04:04.077 --> 04:08.048
-Oh, hello.
-I told them you're the smartest
kid in the world,

04:08.048 --> 04:09.483
and they wanted to meet you!

04:09.483 --> 04:11.485
Tell them what you told me
about worms!

04:11.485 --> 04:14.354
That they are the sharks of
the dirt ocean beneath our feet?

04:14.354 --> 04:15.722

-[excited chatter]
-Interesting development.

[squeaking] Hit the pool!

[splashing and laughter]

04:30.504 --> 04:33.173
Looks like things
are going swimmingly, Til!

04:33.173 --> 04:35.442
-[Sue laughs]
-Ha! Ha! Ha ha!

04:35.442 --> 04:38.111
Would you stop that?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.412
No way! You're boring!

04:39.412 --> 04:41.114
I'm not boring!
I just got stuck

04:41.114 --> 04:43.416
with the world's most
hyperactive hairball--

04:43.416 --> 04:45.085
Ah!

04:45.085 --> 04:46.453
Oh snap. Come on, move,
move, move--

04:46.453 --> 04:47.454
Oh, he's fine.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.688
Ah, that hurt!

04:48.688 --> 04:50.290
Well, yeah!
That's what happens

04:50.290 --> 04:52.292
when you don't [grunts]
tuck and roll!

04:52.292 --> 04:54.361
Wha--?
Show me that again!

04:54.361 --> 04:56.329
-You like that?
-Totally!

04:56.329 --> 04:59.466
I got awesome moves,
the landings just really hurt.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.234
If you could show me
more stuff like that

05:01.234 --> 05:03.670
I could do even cooler moves!
[giggles]

05:03.670 --> 05:07.274
So, stunts. You want me
to teach ya how to do stunts.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.275
Mhm, mhm.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.509
Well, I guess I am

05:09.509 --> 05:11.611
the stunt master general.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.948
-But if I do this,
will you stop torturing me?
-Uh huh, uh huh!

05:14.948 --> 05:17.184
Fine, I'll teach ya
everything I know.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.219
I'll make you better
and stronger than I ever was,

05:19.219 --> 05:20.487
and you have to carry
on my legacy,

05:20.487 --> 05:21.721
but I ain't happy about it!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.590
Just follow me,
you lil' creep.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.592
Great form, Gregory!

05:25.592 --> 05:28.028
I told you, it's Gregly!

05:31.264 --> 05:34.434
All right, peepers on me!
Stunt school's in session.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.603
Lesson one, pinballing.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.974
-Wow!
-All right, your turn.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.642
[grunts] Oof!

05:42.642 --> 05:44.010
Ah.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.212
[whistle blows]

05:45.212 --> 05:46.479

05:50.617 --> 05:52.319
Nice dodging, lil' buddy!

05:52.319 --> 05:54.521

We gotta go now!

05:54.521 --> 05:55.522
[whistle blows]

05:55.522 --> 05:57.457
Final lesson, flinging!

05:57.457 --> 06:00.060
Yeah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.261
Now let go!

06:01.261 --> 06:02.462
-Are you sure?
-Don't worry!

06:02.462 --> 06:03.997
-I gotcha!
-[Chase] Hup!

06:03.997 --> 06:06.333
-[eagle cry]
-Ha.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.969
[both grunt and laugh]

06:08.969 --> 06:11.671
Those are some
pretty sick moves
you little devil!

06:11.671 --> 06:13.974
I think you're ready
for the big leagues.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.508
-Let's go!
-[both grunt]

06:16.977 --> 06:18.511
[heavy breathing]

06:20.513 --> 06:24.618
-Uh, y'know--
-Silence!
The great Tilly speaketh!

06:24.618 --> 06:28.021
Uh, I was just going to say
the water isn't that cold.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.222
What does she mean?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.725
So wise! So powerful!

06:31.725 --> 06:33.360
Emma, may I have a word?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.694
Okay! We will reconvene

06:34.694 --> 06:37.497
for further enlightenment
in five minutes.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.232
What's on your mind, Tilly?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.101
Emma, shouldn't your friends
be gettin' back

06:41.101 --> 06:42.535
to their own big buddies?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.038
But you're the bestest
big buddy there is!

06:45.038 --> 06:48.141
That's why us Till-ites
have come to learn from you.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.643
That is so sweet--
Wait.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.211
Who are the Till-ites?

06:51.211 --> 06:53.413
Us! Your loyal followers.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.117
We wanna be just like you.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.120
And how!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.721
Emma, I'm flattered,

07:01.721 --> 07:03.456
but I'm also
a little uncomfortable

07:03.456 --> 07:05.225
with all this
unwarranted attention.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.693
I hope you understand.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.529
-[gasps]
-It's for you!

07:11.131 --> 07:13.466
Now we all look
just like you.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.435
Uh...

07:17.570 --> 07:20.507
You've done well so far,
my protégé.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.376
But this stunt is the stunt
to end all stunts.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.512
So crazy and stupid,
it's gotten me

07:25.512 --> 07:28.048
officially labeled
a "young disruptor"

07:28.048 --> 07:30.050
and they didn't mean that
in a good way!

07:30.050 --> 07:32.619
Behold, the human boulder!

07:32.619 --> 07:34.421
[manic laughter]

07:34.421 --> 07:36.690
I've rendered a detailed
simulation of how it works.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.625
You and I are gonna jump
on the yoga ball,

07:38.625 --> 07:40.627
activating
the fire extinguisher jet,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.662
sending us flying
around the basketball court,

07:42.662 --> 07:45.432
thus creating utter chaos.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.367
I've also sketched
a bunch of ninjas.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.402
They're not part of the plan,
I just like drawing them.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.137
This is nice.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.206
I've never had a big buddy
like you before.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.009
You're crazy. I'm glad
we got paired up.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.011
I'm glad too,
you little demon.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.213
-You ready for this?
-Bingo bango.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.581
Count down to chaos

08:01.581 --> 08:02.615
in three,

08:02.615 --> 08:04.050
two,

08:04.050 --> 08:05.218
one!

08:05.218 --> 08:06.453
[Sue]
There you kids are!

08:06.453 --> 08:08.588
It's three pm.
Program's over.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.390
Come get some pizza.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.660
-Wahoo! And that's a wrap.
-What about out stunt?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.596
Nah, forget all that,
it's pizza time!

08:16.596 --> 08:18.264
[laughing and cheering]

08:18.264 --> 08:20.100
Oh, yeah!

08:20.100 --> 08:24.070
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm!

08:24.070 --> 08:27.073
Ha, Cricket Green, you really
helped someone out today.

08:27.073 --> 08:30.310
And that someone
was yourself.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.145
Hey! Watch where you're--

08:32.145 --> 08:35.281
-Chase?
-I thought you were
my big buddy!

08:35.281 --> 08:37.217
But you're just a big duddy!

08:37.217 --> 08:39.586
-[gasps]
-[cries]

08:39.586 --> 08:41.321
What was that all about?

08:41.321 --> 08:43.189
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.191
You got further
with Chase than most.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.326
What do you mean?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.028
All his previous big buddies

08:48.028 --> 08:49.396
gave up within an hour.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.031
He's not a bad kid,

08:51.031 --> 08:53.566
he just needs someone
who understands.

I'll admit, I didn't get into
this stuff to be a role model,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.616
I got into it
for some easy cheese.

-Yeah, Dad,

You've been working non-stop
for who knows how long.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.474
That's right, sweetie.

11:48.474 --> 11:52.212
It's a farmer's job to work
his fields every [yawns] day.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.314

And it's a family's job

11:54.314 --> 11:56.449

I heard Bill
was working himself silly,

12:00.119 --> 12:02.989
so I'm taking over
his farming duties for the day!

12:02.989 --> 12:04.057
Ow.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.325
But you can't farm!

You do motorcycles and stuff!

12:07.427 --> 12:09.495

it's all the same!

12:09.495 --> 12:11.164
Now, this is for you.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.170
You look like you need it.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.005
Look, I'd love to relax,

12:19.005 --> 12:21.074
but today is Plow and Plant Day!

A complex series of tasks
that require a delicate balance

but we're supposed
to be co-parents, Bill.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.389
It's time I show up
for the family, too.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.258
Just write me a list
of everything I gotta do,

12:38.258 --> 12:39.525
and I'll get it done.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.227
Now hold on just a minute!

12:41.227 --> 12:43.463
Bill can't skip Plow
and Plant Day just to--!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.198
I got you a message too.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.066

12:50.203 --> 12:52.305
All right, Nance,
here's the instructions.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.440
I'll try to relax,
but you gotta promise

12:54.440 --> 12:56.209
to follow these steps
to a tee.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.577
No sweat, big guy.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.612
I can do things
the Bill Green way.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.649
-All right.
-Now, go have fun!
You deserve it.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.985
Go on, you got it.

[engine rumbles]

13:19.732 --> 13:21.167
You sure you know

13:21.167 --> 13:22.669
what you signed up
for here, Mom?

13:22.669 --> 13:26.005
Much like a Swiss watch,
Papa is very precise

13:26.005 --> 13:29.042
and very tightly wound.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.443
Thanks for the concern, kids,

13:30.443 --> 13:32.378
but I'll be done with this list
in no time.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.480
Uh.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.116
We'll help you out.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.787
Ah, are you ready
to relax, boy?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.221
I don't know, Ma.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.223
All this idleness
makes me anxious.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.792
Don't these people have jobs?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.261
They're here to relax,
same as us!

13:48.261 --> 13:50.463
It's understandable
that after working for a while--

13:50.463 --> 13:51.664
What the--?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.733
-Bill!
-It needed a trim!

13:53.733 --> 13:56.069
Will you stop farming
for two seconds?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.638
You better march over here,
get in your birthday suit,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.707
and get rubbed
with the rest of us!

14:00.707 --> 14:02.408

14:02.408 --> 14:04.243
Don't worry, sir,
you can cover yourself

14:04.243 --> 14:05.712

I can't believe your dad
included sheet music.

is a little simpler.

Unless...

Unless what?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.396
Unless step two wasn't done.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.265
But that wouldn't make sense,

16:39.265 --> 16:42.535
cause Mama said she'd closely
follow all of Papa's steps.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.337
And if it's truly plow time,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.606
then step two
must've been completed!

16:46.606 --> 16:48.241
I just don't get it, Tilly!

16:48.241 --> 16:50.309
What's so important
about step two?

If Miss Brenda isn't brushed
for 300 strokes,

16:53.079 --> 16:55.181
she won't be confident enough
for the big job

16:55.181 --> 16:56.716

17:44.530 --> 17:47.366
What? It couldn't even
break the skin.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.368
I was sure acupuncture
would be the one.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.103
It's time to bring out
the big guns.

17:51.103 --> 17:54.240
Now, I'm going to play
some nature sounds.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.542
Listen to the waves
of the water.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.978

to that!

18:03.382 --> 18:06.352
Hm? Is that fire?

18:06.352 --> 18:09.288
It's just a candle, Bill!
Stop overthinking everything!

18:09.288 --> 18:11.223
In fact, just stop thinking!

18:11.223 --> 18:12.358
How can I not think

18:12.358 --> 18:13.426
when there's an open flame

18:13.426 --> 18:14.994
in a confined space?

18:14.994 --> 18:18.097
Uh, let's try
some guided meditation.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.000
Look deep into
this calming sunset.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.170
Oh no, you don't!
You ain't gonna meditate me!

18:24.170 --> 18:26.238
-Sir, please!
-Get me out of here!

18:26.238 --> 18:27.707
-[man] It's okay.
-I got 'em!

18:27.707 --> 18:30.443
[struggling] Oh.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.278
Here's your chance.
Meditate him!

18:32.278 --> 18:36.582
Okay. Take a deep breath.
Let go of all your burdens.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.151
Let go of all my burgers...

Huh? What the--?

18:45.591 --> 18:46.659
Where am I?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.227
-[man] Bill.
-Dad?

18:48.227 --> 18:51.731
No, Bill. It's me, the Kludge.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.366
Oh my corn, I'm dead!

18:53.366 --> 18:55.234
Not dead, just stressed.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.103
Oh, right. But don't worry,

18:57.103 --> 18:59.739
I've been stressed since birth
and it's never weighed me down.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.042
-[engine sputters]
-What's happenin'?
Why're we slowing down?

19:03.042 --> 19:04.410
We're carrying too big
of a load,

19:04.410 --> 19:05.978
we've got to let go.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.247
-But I can't!
-We have to, Bill.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.116
We'll never make it
with all this weight.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.384
Trust the truck.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.953
-Just let go.
-Just let go?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.956
Just let go.
Just let go.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.491
[indecipherable]

19:18.491 --> 19:20.426
Mighta conked him on the head
a little too hard.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.395
Just let go!

19:22.395 --> 19:26.265
[laughing] Yes!

19:26.265 --> 19:29.502
I've done it.
I've found inner peace.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.437
Inner peace...

19:32.438 --> 19:34.607
Hallelujah! He's cured!

19:34.607 --> 19:36.976
Now, can someone
massage my real leg?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.978
Aah.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.213
Ahh!
This is a mess.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.316
-The cow won't budge.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.318
The field isn't plowed
or planted,

19:46.318 --> 19:47.620
and Bill will be home soon!

19:47.620 --> 19:48.988
We need a plan.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.322
-Ooh, I got one!
-Really?

19:50.322 --> 19:51.557
It's fairly simple,

19:51.557 --> 19:53.426
but we're gonna need
a time machine.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.593
[gasps]

19:54.593 --> 19:55.728

19:55.728 --> 19:57.496

Bill! Listen, I tried,
I really did.
