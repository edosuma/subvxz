00:12.367 --> 00:14.425
(Italian easy listening music)

00:14.525 --> 00:17.343
(Water rippling)

00:17.443 --> 00:22.680
(â™ª "Addio Addio",
Domenico Modugno)

00:27.517 --> 00:32.394
(Water splashing)

00:46.585 --> 00:50.822
(Paint brush clinking)

01:21.282 --> 01:23.681
(Music quietens)

01:25.040 --> 01:29.896
No sound for the next... 2 hours.
Please.

01:29.996 --> 01:31.375
Oh, it's like that, is it?

01:31.475 --> 01:34.893
I don't know why she has to fight sleep.
Every nap time.

01:34.993 --> 01:37.132
Little shit.

01:37.232 --> 01:39.230
Yep.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.629
Speaking of shit...

01:43.628 --> 01:48.325
I'm gonna need you to pop to town later.
Pick up some more nappies?

01:48.425 --> 01:50.683
(Song continues)

01:50.783 --> 01:52.782
(Billy)
Oh, all right.

01:58.458 --> 02:00.157
(Car door shuts)

02:00.257 --> 02:02.256
(Serwa)
Hello Billy.

02:03.215 --> 02:04.834
I work for Marian Wallace.

02:04.934 --> 02:06.933
I know who you are.

02:08.891 --> 02:13.768
Look, er...
Elliot is back in London.

02:15.807 --> 02:17.925
And your mother wants you there...

02:25.401 --> 02:27.439
(Song fades out)

02:28.199 --> 02:30.597
(Footsteps)

02:35.874 --> 02:38.112
(Baby cooing)

02:39.911 --> 02:42.090
(Jacqueline)
You were just gonna sneak out.

02:42.190 --> 02:43.849
(Quiet suspenseful music)

02:43.949 --> 02:45.947
Elliot's back.

02:47.506 --> 02:49.545
- Shh...
- (Baby cooing)

02:53.662 --> 02:55.481
And so you kill him?

02:55.581 --> 02:57.840
I told him where Sean was.
I trusted him.

02:57.940 --> 03:01.138
You know what going back
to that city will do to you.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.675
But you've already decided.

03:05.775 --> 03:09.852
I'll be in and out so fast you won't
even make a dent in those nappies.

03:11.491 --> 03:15.288
And then when you come back.
Who will you be?

03:22.364 --> 03:24.362
Billy.

03:27.161 --> 03:29.319
(Melancholic music)

03:30.399 --> 03:31.778
(Car door closing)

03:31.878 --> 03:34.036
(Car accelerating away)

03:36.315 --> 03:38.313
(Music builds)

03:45.589 --> 03:48.027
(Thunder rumbling)

03:50.226 --> 03:52.744
(Patter of rain)

03:58.221 --> 04:01.658
(Short burst of eerie music)

04:07.974 --> 04:10.573
(Quiet dramatic music)

04:15.689 --> 04:17.768
(Phone vibrating)

04:22.605 --> 04:24.583
(Miss Kane) I know last night
must have been difficult

04:24.683 --> 04:27.821
but you need
to keep your head, Elliot.

04:27.921 --> 04:31.539
Don't forget,
Alex brought this on himself.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.778
I want to see my dad.

04:33.878 --> 04:36.656
That'll depend
on your performance today.

04:36.756 --> 04:39.834
Meanwhile,
we'd like you to meet a friend.

04:40.553 --> 04:43.531
He has a problem
you can help us with.

04:43.631 --> 04:48.168
He's Georgian,
organised, thorough.

04:48.268 --> 04:50.667
Maybe you can learn
a thing or two from him.

04:53.905 --> 04:57.982
Do this for me
and I'll tell you where your father is.

05:45.271 --> 05:46.930
(Ed)
Alex, it's me again.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.429
Presuming you're busy but...

05:52.227 --> 05:54.545
Call me, please.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.143
(Phone vibrating)

06:03.620 --> 06:05.998
(Gate creaking open)

06:06.098 --> 06:09.016
(Dramatic music)

06:11.055 --> 06:13.053
(Music stops)

06:24.926 --> 06:28.623
Elliot Carter. Chuck, chuck, chuck it.

06:28.723 --> 06:30.462
(Laughter)

06:30.562 --> 06:32.781
Don't mess with this guy.

06:32.881 --> 06:37.318
He killed Sean fucking Wallace.
He doesn't give a fuck.

06:50.829 --> 06:54.507
So... I heard you can help me.

06:56.345 --> 06:58.464
I heard it was a special assignment.

06:59.184 --> 07:00.763
What does that mean?

07:00.863 --> 07:04.200
It means you need to say "please".

07:04.300 --> 07:07.618
(Background chatter
from Georgian gangsters)

07:27.485 --> 07:30.124
Someone shot my driver.

07:31.922 --> 07:33.921
(Deep sigh)

07:35.760 --> 07:38.098
Single shooter
bumped us from behind.

07:38.198 --> 07:42.416
Did it in front of Mr Afridi.
Broad daylight.

07:42.516 --> 07:45.714
Professional. Made a statement.

07:46.873 --> 07:49.311
It's the wrong look for me.
You understand?

07:53.868 --> 07:55.867
(Car speeds away)

07:58.305 --> 08:00.684
Look, I have a busy day.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.962
So... you're the cop.

08:04.062 --> 08:06.660
How about you find out
who did this?

08:08.739 --> 08:10.737
Please.

08:13.056 --> 08:16.494
(Quiet suspenseful music)

08:21.171 --> 08:22.590
(Rustling)

08:22.690 --> 08:25.008
(Background chatter)

08:27.886 --> 08:29.385
(Lennie)
Marian.

08:29.485 --> 08:33.503
(Marian) Thank you.
Luan. Where have you been?

08:33.603 --> 08:35.981
(Luan) We thought we had
a problem with the Algerians

08:36.081 --> 08:37.500
but I dealt with it.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.379
What problem?

08:39.479 --> 08:42.677
Koba seized the guns.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.294
But Basem kept our names
out of it.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.492
(Marian) Maybe we should hold off
on the next shipment.

08:49.592 --> 08:54.789
No. We owe the Algerians.
They protected us.

08:56.468 --> 08:58.626
And Koba will go after them.

09:00.065 --> 09:02.164
We need more guns now.

09:02.264 --> 09:05.122
(Marian)
They'll be with you later today.

09:05.222 --> 09:08.140
One of my men will be in touch.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.757
(Clapping)

09:12.857 --> 09:16.075
Amazing performance.

09:16.175 --> 09:19.753
I truly believed I was watching
a man plotting to take me down.

09:19.853 --> 09:21.831
Superb.

09:21.931 --> 09:23.930
Don't you agree, Eddie?

09:26.528 --> 09:29.726
Call me when you have
Marian's location.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.118
How do I know
my wife isn't dead already?

09:45.396 --> 09:48.194
(Eerie music)

09:57.109 --> 09:59.227
(Dial tone)

10:01.985 --> 10:04.864
Put her on the phone.

10:06.183 --> 10:08.181
(Mirlinda)
Luan? Don't give in.

10:09.341 --> 10:10.520
Baby?!

10:10.620 --> 10:13.618
(Mirlinda) Baby? Don't give in,
whatever they say, you don't...

10:15.497 --> 10:17.875
(Groaning)

10:17.975 --> 10:19.974
Oh!

10:21.573 --> 10:25.050
Motherfucker!

10:27.249 --> 10:29.308
Yeah.

10:29.408 --> 10:31.406
(Sigh)

10:34.764 --> 10:38.861
I was handling this.
We do not touch families.

10:38.961 --> 10:41.620
That is not
how you gain respect.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.278
Some people have to learn
the hard way, Eddie.

10:44.998 --> 10:47.376
This is how to make people
fall in line.

10:47.476 --> 10:51.413
If you're stupid enough
to have a family in this world,

10:51.513 --> 10:53.732
then they are fair game.

10:53.832 --> 10:55.831
(Door opening)

10:57.709 --> 11:00.288
We have a problem.
Our new Somali friends.

11:00.388 --> 11:02.946
Somebody just killed
three of them.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.720
See you there, Eddie.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.819
(Quiet dramatic music)

11:14.299 --> 11:15.878
(Woman)
Mr Dumani, please.

11:15.978 --> 11:18.636
(Ed) You let Koba took his wife?
I'm trying to understand

11:18.736 --> 11:20.714
why you trust
a lying, two-faced mercenary

11:20.814 --> 11:22.813
to solve your problems.

11:25.771 --> 11:28.210
You haven't heard the news?

11:32.087 --> 11:34.086
It's Alex.

11:38.963 --> 11:41.921
He jumped
from his building last night.

11:45.598 --> 11:48.157
He was so young,

11:48.716 --> 11:50.735
and I think he got into the trap

11:50.835 --> 11:54.433
of believing
that he was too important.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.587
All that pressure.

12:05.905 --> 12:07.904
I tried to help him,

12:09.863 --> 12:11.841
but he wouldn't listen.

12:11.941 --> 12:14.660
Something must have snapped in him.

12:16.299 --> 12:19.996
The Investors made sure
it didn't reach today's news.

12:20.096 --> 12:22.095
I'm sorry, Ed.

12:23.654 --> 12:25.872
If there is anything I can do.

12:25.972 --> 12:28.371
(Downbeat music)

13:18.618 --> 13:21.536
(Blues rock music)

13:34.768 --> 13:37.306
(Blues rock music fades)

13:37.406 --> 13:39.845
(Footsteps on wooden floor)

13:46.400 --> 13:48.519
Hello Billy.

13:51.237 --> 13:53.236
You look well.

13:58.313 --> 13:59.852
How's Jacqueline?

13:59.952 --> 14:01.950
And the baby?

14:06.867 --> 14:08.866
I'd just rather know where he is.

14:14.582 --> 14:17.240
You think taking London back
will fix this family?

14:17.340 --> 14:18.719
It won't.

14:18.819 --> 14:21.038
Then what are you doing here?

14:21.138 --> 14:23.396
I'm the family fuck-up.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.255
If I hadn't left my baby brother
on his own...

14:27.494 --> 14:29.592
he'd still be alive.

14:29.692 --> 14:31.971
I have to kill Elliot.

14:33.410 --> 14:36.128
Now, either you tell me
where he is,

14:37.127 --> 14:39.626
or I'll go to London
and find him myself.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.725
Billy.

14:44.003 --> 14:46.282
We just heard from Serwa.

14:47.441 --> 14:49.799
Alex Dumani was killed
last night.

14:51.078 --> 14:55.476
If you do this,
you take my men with you.

14:57.434 --> 15:00.073
I can't lose another child.

15:00.992 --> 15:03.351
(Blues rock music resumes)

15:09.786 --> 15:13.204
You know what I mean.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.303
Then use it.

15:16.062 --> 15:18.061
(Darragh)
Let's go.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.858
(Blues rock music fades out)

15:52.958 --> 15:55.896
(Muffled voices in the background)

15:55.996 --> 15:57.655
(Quiet dramatic music)

15:57.755 --> 16:00.134
(Koba)
Well, we know this isn't Luan's work.

16:00.234 --> 16:02.352
(Koba breathing heavily)

16:15.424 --> 16:17.583
Eddie, help me out here.

16:30.854 --> 16:32.853
(Koba)
Fuck!

16:33.572 --> 16:36.550
- (Shutter door clattering)
- (Shouting)

16:36.650 --> 16:38.649
(Elliot)
Get out of my face.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.758
- What's he doing here?
- He's with me. A short loan.

17:02.474 --> 17:04.612
Is Shannon with you?

17:04.712 --> 17:08.649
What?
No. No, I haven't seen her.

17:08.749 --> 17:11.428
Good. You keep away from her.

17:13.267 --> 17:15.385
Ah, yes.

17:16.385 --> 17:18.423
He fucked your daughter.

17:21.781 --> 17:25.419
Well, if you're not gonna fuck him up,
can we deal with this?

17:26.898 --> 17:29.056
You think this is linked
with your dead driver?

17:30.855 --> 17:32.854
It's a good game, no?

17:34.093 --> 17:37.811
Pick off Koba's buddies
so he has no one else to play with.

17:45.006 --> 17:48.903
We both know who's behind this.
Who'd like to fuck me right now?

17:49.003 --> 17:51.262
It doesn't seem like Marian's style.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.361
Then who?

17:53.960 --> 17:56.359
Isn't that why he's here?

18:02.075 --> 18:04.014
I'll make some calls.

18:04.114 --> 18:06.712
See if we can get
to the CCTV out there.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.346
(Dramatic music builds)

18:17.305 --> 18:19.304
(Muffled voices)

18:20.583 --> 18:22.662
(Falling can clattering)

18:25.620 --> 18:27.938
(Muffled voices grow louder)

18:30.297 --> 18:33.335
(Man)
Hey, big man. Bro!

18:55.520 --> 18:59.858
- (Car window winding down)
- You checking up on me?

18:59.958 --> 19:02.116
Can I see my dad now?

19:03.995 --> 19:05.934
That's not such a good idea.

19:06.034 --> 19:08.032
It is.

19:08.432 --> 19:11.070
If you want me to keep my head.

19:12.989 --> 19:15.328
He's at the Greenview House
Residential Home.

19:15.428 --> 19:17.526
It's a nice place.

19:17.626 --> 19:19.905
(Car window winding up)

19:20.704 --> 19:23.542
(Car engine starting)

19:32.976 --> 19:35.694
- (Car door shuts)
- (Dramatic music fades)

19:36.534 --> 19:38.992
Elliot.

19:39.092 --> 19:41.251
- Yeah, it's all right.
- (Woman) Okay.

19:42.530 --> 19:45.168
It's not as bad as it looks.

19:53.043 --> 19:55.322
(Chuckles)

19:58.799 --> 20:00.818
(Charlie)
There was three of them.

20:00.918 --> 20:02.457
Took off with my wallet.

20:02.557 --> 20:04.096
(Elliot)
As long as you're all right.

20:04.196 --> 20:07.454
Think I still caught one of them
with a right hook though.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.572
- Boom.
- Oh yeah?

20:09.672 --> 20:11.671
(Both chuckle)

20:12.790 --> 20:14.050
(Sigh)

20:14.150 --> 20:16.508
(1950s rock 'n' roll music playing)

20:24.903 --> 20:26.282
I'm sorry, Dad.

20:26.382 --> 20:28.920
Don't be silly.
It's not your fault.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.179
And you've been busy working.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.717
You must be doing well for yourself.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.815
Your bosses ain't been scrimping
with this place.

20:38.094 --> 20:40.093
Ah, Dad.

20:41.372 --> 20:43.491
What's going on, son?

20:47.928 --> 20:49.986
I'm gonna get us out of here.

20:50.086 --> 20:53.564
Get you on that beach
in Jamaica... after all.

20:57.402 --> 20:59.660
I'd better pack my shorts then.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.759
(Laughter)

21:05.676 --> 21:09.514
You're weeping.
Change that dressing, yeah?

21:10.713 --> 21:12.712
Elliot...

21:20.547 --> 21:22.545
(Sigh)

21:26.143 --> 21:29.181
(Quiet suspenseful music)

21:31.260 --> 21:33.258
(Clink of loose tile)

21:35.457 --> 21:37.576
(Music builds)

21:40.134 --> 21:42.532
(Clink of tea cup)

21:44.331 --> 21:46.490
(Tape tearing)

21:53.206 --> 21:55.204
(Clink)

21:58.602 --> 22:00.601
(Phone dialling tone)

22:05.797 --> 22:10.954
Yeah... I have something
you might be interested in.

22:14.911 --> 22:17.550
(Baby crying)

22:27.064 --> 22:29.042
Have you approved
the extra payments?

22:29.142 --> 22:31.681
(Floriana) The main Bradbury account
is almost empty,

22:31.781 --> 22:34.759
but there are others.
Rutherford is on top of it.

22:34.859 --> 22:38.716
Good.
Then everything is under control.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.815
(Baby crying)

22:43.413 --> 22:46.151
Another gun shipment?

22:46.251 --> 22:47.870
The Algerians.

22:47.970 --> 22:49.669
They need to protect themselves

22:49.769 --> 22:52.447
and we need allies
to take back London.

22:53.207 --> 22:56.624
And Billy?
Was it wise to send him there?

22:56.724 --> 22:58.024
He's not a soldier

22:58.124 --> 23:00.862
but you've let him
go chasing after a killer.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.420
Do you really think
he can handle it?

23:03.520 --> 23:05.799
He's coming back.

23:07.597 --> 23:09.596
I hope so.

23:14.553 --> 23:16.492
(Exasperated groan)

23:16.592 --> 23:18.950
(Phone vibrating)

23:23.787 --> 23:25.766
(Koba)
Elliot, what do you have for me?

23:25.866 --> 23:28.404
There's nothing on the CCTV,

23:28.504 --> 23:31.042
but one of the locals saw
a red car drive off

23:31.142 --> 23:33.521
so could be the same guy
that shot your driver.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.160
(Koba)
Interesting...

23:35.260 --> 23:37.778
- Good. Good.
- (Phone camera clicks)

23:39.097 --> 23:41.655
- (Phone camera clicks)
- (Music stops)

23:55.766 --> 23:57.765
This lad killed yer brother?

23:58.365 --> 24:00.783
(Quiet suspenseful music)

24:00.883 --> 24:03.521
You'll be wanting
to shoot the shot then.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.657
Serwa's watching your man.
She'll lead us to him.

24:09.757 --> 24:11.836
Then he's all yours, right?

24:14.474 --> 24:17.792
Heads, I meet the Albanians.
Tails you do.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.668
Happy hunting, boyos.

24:26.706 --> 24:29.145
(Suspenseful music builds)

24:48.612 --> 24:51.850
We have three dead Somalis now.
Three!

24:52.969 --> 24:56.427
It's the same fucking guy
that shot my driver!

24:56.527 --> 24:59.445
And Marian Wallace
is in cahoots with Luan.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.823
That's interesting.

25:02.923 --> 25:04.922
How so?

25:07.080 --> 25:09.778
The bank accounts that Basem
transferred his money into

25:09.878 --> 25:11.617
for the gun deal.

25:11.717 --> 25:14.255
I had people looking into them.

25:14.355 --> 25:16.694
They're called Bradbury Holdings.

25:16.794 --> 25:20.072
Finn used them to hide 1.5 billion
of the Investors' money.

25:21.871 --> 25:25.728
Marian Wallace is using it
to fund her gun-running.

25:25.828 --> 25:29.506
How the fuck
did she get hold of it?

25:30.785 --> 25:34.163
She must've tracked down
his Albanian mistress.

25:34.263 --> 25:37.400
I have the name of the lawyer
who's a proxy on the account.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.499
- I'll deal with him.
- No.

25:39.899 --> 25:43.776
You will get everyone back in line.

25:45.216 --> 25:50.532
Make sure Basem understands
it's time for him to repay his debt.

25:51.891 --> 25:54.130
I will deal with this lawyer.

25:55.409 --> 25:58.127
Mr Rutherford. Please, please.

25:58.927 --> 26:01.045
(Gentle piano music playing)

26:08.680 --> 26:11.059
Hm. Mm...

26:11.159 --> 26:12.458
I told you.

26:12.558 --> 26:16.275
So, you're looking
to open an account?

26:17.794 --> 26:22.112
No. But I was hoping that
you would help me with another one.

26:22.951 --> 26:25.090
Bradbury Holdings.

26:25.190 --> 26:29.907
It's holding stolen money
belonging to my friends.

26:31.386 --> 26:33.424
I don't ask where it comes from.

26:35.863 --> 26:38.361
So you lure me here
under false pretences,

26:38.461 --> 26:42.079
slap down a bit of beef and expect
me to fuck my own reputation?

26:42.179 --> 26:47.555
Mr Rutherford,
I can't convince you to reconsider?

26:47.655 --> 26:50.633
Even the whole fucking cow
wouldn't be enough.

26:50.733 --> 26:52.732
(Laughter)

26:53.371 --> 26:56.070
In that case,
let's enjoy the food.

26:56.170 --> 26:57.988
Mm-hm.

26:58.088 --> 27:00.207
(Muffled chatter of diners)

27:04.005 --> 27:06.243
Oh, here come the suits.

27:08.162 --> 27:10.360
This the hard pitch now, is it?

27:13.319 --> 27:15.317
(Groaning)

27:16.516 --> 27:18.515
Yes.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.013
(Muffled groans)

27:21.113 --> 27:23.552
(Piano music continues)

27:33.106 --> 27:34.924
- (Thud)
- (Muffled anguished cries)

27:35.024 --> 27:36.324
The shell company.

27:36.424 --> 27:40.301
You're going to tell me
everything that you know

27:41.021 --> 27:44.358
and transfer the ownership to us.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.836
(Rutherford)
Ah! Yes! Yes!

27:47.936 --> 27:49.935
Excellent.

27:50.534 --> 27:52.573
(Groaning)

27:54.012 --> 27:56.011
- (Thud)
- (Muffled anguished cries)

28:01.168 --> 28:03.726
(Piano music builds)

28:09.402 --> 28:11.381
(Piano music fades)

28:11.481 --> 28:13.560
You're not really going to do this?

28:14.879 --> 28:17.137
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

28:17.237 --> 28:21.175
Let Koba... do whatever
he wants to my wife?

28:21.275 --> 28:24.413
You heard Mirlinda.
You can't give in. This was your idea.

28:24.513 --> 28:27.451
You said working with the Wallace
woman would save our business.

28:27.551 --> 28:28.930
You want to mess with that?

28:29.030 --> 28:31.008
Show the other gangs
that we fuck over our partners?!

28:31.108 --> 28:33.167
(Darragh)
Good afternoon, fellas.

28:33.267 --> 28:35.266
(Van door slams)

28:35.785 --> 28:38.943
(Darragh)
Heard you're after some more guns?

28:46.338 --> 28:48.457
(Suspenseful music)

28:49.177 --> 28:52.095
(Killian) She says that's him
up ahead. You ready, lad?

29:05.006 --> 29:07.005
(Killian)
Go. Get out and follow.

29:08.844 --> 29:11.242
(Suspenseful music)

29:21.755 --> 29:24.194
(Baby crying)

29:28.871 --> 29:31.229
(Muffled voices)

29:51.536 --> 29:53.535
(Woman exclaims)

30:24.635 --> 30:26.634
(Killian)
Where is he?

30:32.550 --> 30:35.228
(Church bells ringing)

31:07.647 --> 31:10.465
(Upbeat Algerian music playing)

31:10.565 --> 31:12.564
(Doorbell chimes)

31:15.242 --> 31:17.241
(Koba humming)

31:28.713 --> 31:30.712
Faz, right?

31:32.111 --> 31:35.989
So what?
You're here to take my wife too?

31:36.588 --> 31:38.587
She's been dead six years.

31:39.906 --> 31:43.324
- Whoa!
- Hey, hey... Come on.

31:43.424 --> 31:46.662
- (Hakim) What's going on?
- We're cool, we're cool.

31:48.461 --> 31:52.538
I have a way for you
to make amends with Mr Afridi.

31:53.297 --> 31:57.355
From now on you will work
exclusively with me.

31:57.455 --> 31:59.873
All your drugs biz
will go through us.

31:59.973 --> 32:04.051
Quick and reliable delivery.
Top-notch customer service.

32:05.969 --> 32:08.368
- (Door slamming shut)
- (Quiet dramatic music)

32:09.327 --> 32:11.726
Tell me what happened? Now!

32:12.445 --> 32:14.224
Fuck!

32:14.324 --> 32:18.621
Faz, you've not been right.
I saw you argue with Hakim.

32:18.721 --> 32:21.459
Now this guy shows
and you're shitting yourself.

32:21.559 --> 32:23.138
(Koba)
We will give you protection

32:23.238 --> 32:26.876
and in return I expect
your full support.

32:28.795 --> 32:31.253
You have the ear of the streets.

32:31.353 --> 32:33.971
Tell them
what a great friend I am. Hm?

32:34.071 --> 32:36.070
(Discordant music)

32:36.789 --> 32:38.448
You will hate me.

32:38.548 --> 32:41.846
Hate you?
I could never hate you.

32:41.946 --> 32:46.303
You can tell me anything.
Come on, Faz, what is it?

32:47.982 --> 32:50.181
(Koba)
Ciao for now, okay!

32:56.936 --> 32:58.935
(Whispers) Hakim...

33:01.773 --> 33:04.412
See, Uncle, it's not a bad deal.

33:07.490 --> 33:09.728
(Hakim)
This could be good for us, no?

33:11.847 --> 33:14.685
No. That was too easy.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.842
But we don't have a choice now.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.398
(Clicking)

33:44.546 --> 33:47.304
Should've hit the cunt
when you had the chance.

33:50.822 --> 33:54.559
Now, Darragh hasn't checked in.
This is a fucking shit-show!

33:54.659 --> 33:56.658
(Clicking continues)

33:57.777 --> 33:59.976
Are you simple, lad?

34:03.893 --> 34:05.892
(Car door slams)

34:06.212 --> 34:09.389
- Where you going?
- To piss!

34:09.489 --> 34:11.488
- (Church bells ringing)
- (Thud)

34:12.168 --> 34:14.166
(Loud bang of door)

34:45.786 --> 34:48.025
Just the three?

34:49.064 --> 34:51.222
There are more outside.

34:52.262 --> 34:53.921
Necessary precautions.

34:54.021 --> 34:56.039
What, now Big Boy's not here
to slap me about,

34:56.139 --> 34:58.038
all of sudden
you're scared of me?

34:58.138 --> 35:00.696
What do you want, Elliot?

35:01.856 --> 35:05.673
I've got data you can use
against the Investors.

35:05.773 --> 35:09.750
It's yours if you help get me
and my dad to safety.

35:09.850 --> 35:11.749
(Quiet dramatic music)

35:11.849 --> 35:14.627
Why should I trust you?

35:14.727 --> 35:17.865
What's changed since we last spoke?

35:17.965 --> 35:24.041
I'm sick and tired...
of killing for those people.

35:24.721 --> 35:28.938
I watched Alex Dumani die last night
and they've got my dad hostage.

35:29.038 --> 35:31.097
I have what you need.

35:31.197 --> 35:33.975
I'm closer to them
than you will ever be.

35:34.075 --> 35:40.191
And I'm offering you the chance
to take the easy route and do a deal.

35:41.310 --> 35:45.547
I'll need to see this data. Verify.

35:48.186 --> 35:52.263
You need
to get me and my dad out first.

35:52.983 --> 35:55.381
Then I ask it again.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.857
Why should I trust you?

36:02.536 --> 36:05.814
Check these bank accounts.
"Verify".

36:07.213 --> 36:09.892
You'll find they're all connected
to organised crime.

36:19.965 --> 36:23.723
You hold up your end of the bargain,
I'll give you the chip with the rest.

36:25.721 --> 36:28.160
- I'll be in touch.
- Yeah. Well, chop chop.

36:29.479 --> 36:32.457
Someone's out there shooting
people, if you hadn't heard.

36:32.557 --> 36:35.795
- (Dramatic music)
- (Passing traffic)

36:41.231 --> 36:43.890
(Man)
Watch it!

36:43.990 --> 36:46.408
Fucking look at yourself.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.507
(Distorted voices
in the background)

36:51.105 --> 36:53.184
What can I do?

36:53.943 --> 36:55.942
Nothing.

36:59.060 --> 37:01.238
(Gunshots)

37:01.338 --> 37:04.097
(Male voice on computer game)
Great shot. Great shot.

37:06.735 --> 37:08.434
Victory.

37:08.534 --> 37:10.432
Woo! (Laughter)

37:10.532 --> 37:13.590
Whoa, Mum.
How'd you get so fire?

37:13.690 --> 37:15.689
(Chuckles)

37:17.888 --> 37:18.907
(Knocking)

37:19.007 --> 37:21.245
I'll go get that.

37:27.441 --> 37:30.120
(Dramatic music)

37:38.834 --> 37:42.152
How can my baby brother
be taken just like that?

37:47.109 --> 37:49.547
Alex chose his path.

37:50.467 --> 37:54.304
So you're just gonna let them
get away with it? Do nothing?

37:56.023 --> 37:58.381
Vengeance only brings chaos.

37:59.141 --> 38:03.478
Chaos only costs more lives.
And I do not want to lose both of you.

38:03.578 --> 38:05.857
So what's the plan then?

38:09.294 --> 38:11.333
You and Danny need to come home.

38:13.012 --> 38:15.051
Where it's safe.

38:15.930 --> 38:19.328
- Let me protect you.
- You couldn't protect your own son!

38:20.527 --> 38:24.445
You couldn't keep me out of jail!
So why should I believe you now?

38:27.203 --> 38:29.761
(Crying) So, no.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.918
(Calmly) No.

38:35.677 --> 38:37.456
- I'll protect Danny and me.
- Shannon...

38:37.556 --> 38:39.015
And I don't wanna hear from you

38:39.115 --> 38:42.333
except when you tell me
we're gonna bury him.

38:42.433 --> 38:45.071
(Footsteps descending stairs)

38:58.183 --> 39:00.581
(Subdued music)

39:15.611 --> 39:18.669
(Crying)

39:18.769 --> 39:21.028
(Front door opens)

39:21.128 --> 39:23.526
(â™ª "Hummingbird", Low Roar)

39:24.286 --> 39:28.083
â™ª Tentative captain

39:34.839 --> 39:40.156
â™ª Don't keep
your eyes on the ground...

39:42.114 --> 39:43.493
(Glass smashing)

39:43.593 --> 39:46.671
â™ª Heaven's been offered

39:52.188 --> 39:59.023
â™ª Leaving this Earth's
such a beautiful sound...

39:59.623 --> 40:01.622
I don't want you to die.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.879
(Plug socket clunking off wall)

40:05.979 --> 40:11.256
â™ª I'm safe when I feel
I don't feel it's not around

40:13.934 --> 40:18.411
â™ª So I'm leaving tomorrow...

40:20.969 --> 40:23.568
(Crying) I don't want you to die.

40:34.361 --> 40:36.299
- (Car lock beep)
- (Tamaz whistling)

40:36.399 --> 40:38.598
â™ª Hesitant captain...

40:39.157 --> 40:41.276
(Tamaz) We have to go check
on the Algerian.

40:42.635 --> 40:47.232
â™ª It's too late to turn back around

40:51.230 --> 40:53.848
â™ª The party, it's waiting...

40:53.948 --> 40:55.987
(Phone vibrating)

41:00.184 --> 41:07.259
â™ª Leaving this Earth's
such a beautiful sound...

41:07.859 --> 41:12.116
(Basem) Please can I have
three of this one...? Thank you.

41:12.216 --> 41:18.892
â™ª And I fear when I fear,
I don't fear it's not around...

41:21.290 --> 41:24.028
(Afrim)
(Groaning) Tell me where she is!

41:24.128 --> 41:26.227
â™ª So I'm leaving tomorrow

41:26.327 --> 41:28.925
Tell me where she is!

41:29.725 --> 41:31.504
(Darragh)
Fuck you...

41:31.604 --> 41:37.720
â™ª Don't cry for me,
I'm the talk of the town

41:40.598 --> 41:42.377
(Luan)
Just tell me where she is?

41:42.477 --> 41:44.375
â™ª And don't worry, Mother...

41:44.475 --> 41:46.474
(Phone vibrating)

41:48.153 --> 41:52.370
(Killian) Marian, Darragh's missing
and so's yer son.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.169
What do you want me to do?

41:54.269 --> 41:58.586
â™ª I blow kisses to you
while the sun's going down

42:02.464 --> 42:09.659
â™ª Tell Dad I'm all right
and I'll see him around

42:13.616 --> 42:16.335
â™ª Maybe tomorrow

42:22.451 --> 42:25.888
(â™ª Instrumental break)

42:33.683 --> 42:36.961
(Phone dialling)

42:40.839 --> 42:43.517
(Jacqueline)
Have you done it then?

42:49.793 --> 42:51.792
Billy?

42:58.707 --> 43:00.706
Billy?

43:01.386 --> 43:03.584
How's the shit machine?

43:04.823 --> 43:07.521
This afternoon
she got into your paints.

43:07.621 --> 43:10.819
She did a nice little mural
on the lounge wall.

43:12.858 --> 43:14.757
Think she wants to paint,
like her uncle.

43:14.857 --> 43:21.213
â™ª Leaving this Earth's
such a beautiful sound â™ª

43:21.732 --> 43:25.330
(Baby crying)

43:26.529 --> 43:28.528
Come home.

43:31.606 --> 43:33.805
Come home, Billy.

43:36.363 --> 43:38.362
Billy?

43:45.197 --> 43:49.914
I've given you Marian's location.
Now give me my wife.

43:50.554 --> 43:52.412
(Fizzing)

43:52.512 --> 43:54.671
(Belt buckle rattling)

(Sobbing)

44:36.964 --> 44:39.002
(Song fades)

45:13.620 --> 45:15.619
Alexa, dim the lights.

45:39.563 --> 45:42.841
(Moaning)

45:59.350 --> 46:01.509
(Quiet dramatic music)

46:11.982 --> 46:14.860
(Rap music playing quietly)

46:22.016 --> 46:25.573
I need to speak to Basem.
Basem, is he here?

46:26.773 --> 46:29.171
(Muffled shouting and chatter)

46:32.369 --> 46:37.526
(Basem) You never get up
this early to do the fish run.

46:40.084 --> 46:42.682
Something on your mind?

46:46.360 --> 46:48.918
Uncle, you can't trust Hakim.

46:50.078 --> 46:52.256
He's working with Koba.

46:52.356 --> 46:54.355
How do you know this?

46:55.634 --> 46:59.552
Faz. He's shit scared.

47:00.351 --> 47:03.049
You've always been far too clever
for your own good.

47:03.149 --> 47:04.688
Uncle, what do we do?

47:04.788 --> 47:09.545
No 'we'.
I... will deal with Hakim.

47:10.145 --> 47:14.702
But you say nothing. To no one.
I don't want you mixed up in this.

47:18.339 --> 47:20.338
Please.

47:20.938 --> 47:24.895
Remember, you have to look after me
when I'm old and decrepit.

47:25.974 --> 47:28.113
Okay, Uncle.
But I'm not wiping your ass.

47:28.213 --> 47:29.192
Ah...

47:29.292 --> 47:33.669
I'll hire someone for that.

47:33.769 --> 47:36.028
(Laughter)

47:36.128 --> 47:37.787
(Gunshot)

47:37.887 --> 47:40.565

47:42.444 --> 47:44.482
(Sombre music)

48:04.430 --> 48:06.428
(Male voice)
I'm sorry.

48:13.144 --> 48:15.502
(Car engine starts
and speeds off)

48:21.379 --> 48:23.657
(Distant screaming)

48:25.256 --> 48:27.794
(Crying)

48:27.894 --> 48:30.053
Please help me!

48:35.370 --> 48:37.368
(Muffled) Fuck!

48:48.961 --> 48:51.739
(Muffled) You okay?
Eh? Come with me.

48:51.839 --> 48:56.136
We're going to lead you out,
all right? Ready?

48:56.236 --> 48:58.674
(Crying)

49:01.713 --> 49:03.092
(Crying)

49:03.192 --> 49:05.450
- What's your name?
- Saba.

49:05.550 --> 49:07.549
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm Elliot, okay?

49:08.628 --> 49:12.406
Hey, hey. I promise you.
I promise, I'm not gonna hurt you.

49:12.506 --> 49:17.222
Come on. Come over here.
You're gonna be all right, okay?

49:21.899 --> 49:23.898
(Approaching footsteps)

49:27.296 --> 49:29.854
(Discordant music)

49:36.290 --> 49:39.188
- Billy, you don't have to do this.
- (Shouting) Yes, I do!

49:39.288 --> 49:42.426
(Frantic muffled voices
in the background)

49:42.526 --> 49:44.225
(Music intensifies)

49:44.325 --> 49:46.324
(Elliot)
Wait!

49:52.919 --> 49:54.858
(Gunshot)

49:54.958 --> 49:57.117
(Gunfire)

50:07.990 --> 50:09.988
(Groaning)

50:13.066 --> 50:15.485
All right. Just stay here.
I'm coming right back, okay?

50:15.585 --> 50:18.303
- (Crying) No!
- I'm coming right back.

50:22.101 --> 50:25.019
(Commotion)

50:26.897 --> 50:29.296
(Shouting)

50:34.732 --> 50:36.811

- (Banging on car bonnet)

51:48.205 --> 51:50.204
What the fuck's going on?

51:50.843 --> 51:52.782
(Billy)
Just fucking drive!

51:52.882 --> 51:54.861
- (Gunfire)

(Killian) Don't worry, lad.
We'll get you out.

52:21.623 --> 52:24.062
(Elliot)
Get down! Get down!

52:26.700 --> 52:28.699
