WEBVTT

00:18.435 --> 00:20.020
[bag rustling]

00:28.069 --> 00:33.491
[breathing heavily]

00:38.121 --> 00:40.790
[theme music playing]

02:18.680 --> 02:21.599
[man laughing]

02:24.853 --> 02:28.064
[man]  I saw that kid Spinks
bust his ass the last time in Vegas.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.818
[chuckles]  Oh, he got
way too confident, boy.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.653
[laughs]

02:33.736 --> 02:36.781
You should've seen that face
when he left the ring.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.535
[laughs]

02:40.618 --> 02:44.247
The Norton fight, too.
Ali didn't have a prayer.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.249
-[guard]  Norton's tough.
-[man]  Huh!

02:46.332 --> 02:50.837
Kept getting backed up into the corner.
His gloves up all around his ears.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.173
Norton broke Ali's jaw.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.342
-[guard]  I remember that.
-[man laughs]

02:58.261 --> 03:01.514
Saw this interview with Ali's trainer.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.518
He said he didn't know what was wrong.

03:06.102 --> 03:09.355
The mouthpiece
just kept coming out bloody.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.190
[laughs]

03:11.774 --> 03:14.277
Oh! Norton got a lot of shots in,

03:15.403 --> 03:18.114
but still, that was something.

03:20.074 --> 03:25.830
It is not an easy thing
to break a human being's jaw.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.541
Let me assure you...

03:30.126 --> 03:33.129
that takes practice.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.840
[chuckles]

03:37.926 --> 03:40.845
Hey, welcome to Oregon.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.431
Thanks.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.685
I'm Holden Ford, this is Bill Tench.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.103
We're with the Federal Bureau of--

03:49.187 --> 03:50.647
Can I get something to drink?

03:51.731 --> 03:52.815
Sure. Coffee?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.735
Coffee's okay, I guess.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.571
-Could we get him a coffee, please?
-Actually...

03:59.405 --> 04:04.077
what I'd really love
is some cigarettes and a pizza.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.163
-Afraid we can't help you with that.
-Really?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.706
[laughs] You're the FBI.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.625
We can get you anything
in the commissary.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.752
Well, fuck you for wasting my time.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.922
-What?
-[man laughs]

04:16.005 --> 04:18.216
Just messing with you guys.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.221
Do you mind if we record?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.474
I don't know. Tony, do we mind?

04:26.557 --> 04:29.143
-You got the paperwork?
-This was pre-approved.

04:29.227 --> 04:33.064
-Hey, I didn't approve anything.
-You don't have to do this, Jerry.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.109
Okay.

04:36.192 --> 04:40.280
I'll do it,
as long as I know I don't have to.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.032
[laughs]

04:43.116 --> 04:45.660
-We'll take it from here.
-Yeah, Tony, I'm good.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.458
[Holden clears throat]

04:56.087 --> 04:57.422
Mr. Brudos...

04:58.840 --> 05:02.343
we are conducting interviews with people
who've been convicted of violent crimes.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.972
What you discuss with us cannot be used
against you in your applications--

05:06.055 --> 05:07.515
[Brudos] That's your recorder?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.518
Electronics these days
keep getting smaller.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.020
Where's the mic?

05:12.895 --> 05:15.106
See that little shiny part on the top?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.275
No shit.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.737
You should see the cameras coming out,
fit in your pocket.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
What you discuss with us

05:25.366 --> 05:28.328
cannot be used against you
in your applications for parole.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.205
We will be asking you
about your family history,

05:31.289 --> 05:32.790
antecedent behavior,

05:32.874 --> 05:35.835
and thought patterns surrounding
the crimes you've been convicted of.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.755
Our goal is to eventually publish
a statistical analysis

05:38.838 --> 05:40.757
which will not include your name.

05:40.840 --> 05:45.136
[Brudos pretends to snore]

05:46.220 --> 05:48.598
Thought this was gonna break
the monotony.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.850
We can go straight to the questions,
if you prefer.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.101
Please.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.686
Okay.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.689
Let's discuss the pre-crime phase.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.693
Specifically, the day before you killed
your first victim, Laura Sullivan.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.112
I didn't kill Laura Sullivan.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.490
You didn't kill...

06:05.573 --> 06:09.118
They never found her body.
I was never convicted of that murder.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.953
-[Holden] But you confessed to it.
-Nope.

06:11.954 --> 06:15.416
On... June 27, 1969,

06:15.500 --> 06:19.378
you confessed to murdering Laura Sullivan,
Jane Weber, and Kathy Schmidt.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.631
-Don't go by that.
-[Holden] Why not?

06:21.714 --> 06:23.591
It was given under coercion.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.176
You're saying it was forced?

06:25.259 --> 06:27.303
I am looking
at three consecutive life sentences

06:27.386 --> 06:30.014
thanks to an elaborate plot
by the Portland PD.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.559
You pleaded guilty
to three counts of murder.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.020
They drugged me. Beat me.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.064
Wouldn't let me talk to a lawyer.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.649
Turned away my wife.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.027
Told me they'd go after my kids
if I didn't confess.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.029
Are you saying
you never met Laura Sullivan?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.865
Yeah, I met her.
She was wandering around my front yard.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.325
-Selling encyclopedias.
-That's right.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.744
-That part of the confession is correct?
-Sure.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.163
You said...

06:55.623 --> 06:56.624
she was lost.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.460
It was raining,
she couldn't find the right address.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.963
But you told her
that you ordered the encyclopedias.

07:02.046 --> 07:02.964
Nope.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.674
You didn't say that?

07:04.757 --> 07:05.925
We got to chatting.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.970
She was an aspiring model.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.640
Not surprising, she was beautiful.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.519
I said I'd take some photos of her.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.690
Is that when you invited her in,
took her to the garage?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.607
Yep.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.776
Sent your wife and children out
to get hamburgers?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.194
I thought we could use privacy.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.530
Then you hit her with a two-by-four?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.658
[chuckles]

07:31.159 --> 07:33.619
Actually,
I realized I didn't have any film.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.789
I apologized for wasting her time,
showed her out.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.709
Okay.

07:41.252 --> 07:45.381
The day before you met Laura Sullivan.
Can you tell me what you were feeling?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.634
You consider yourself a bit
of a photographer, right, Jerry?

07:48.718 --> 07:51.095
Got my first camera at 15.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.513
You're into ladies' fashions?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.766
Mm... it's women, isn't it?
Can't call them ladies anymore.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.226
Women's fashions.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.687
I've got my magazine subscriptions,
I know what's going on.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.231
-You subscribe to...
-Mostly shoe catalogs.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.192
Shoe catalogs.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.359
It's my smut.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.986
So you masturbate to it?

08:07.778 --> 08:09.322
That's usually how it works.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.407
Did you masturbate
to the photos of your victims?

08:11.949 --> 08:13.993
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.245
The photos the police found
in your garage?

08:17.788 --> 08:20.124
Did you see them? [scoffs]

08:20.208 --> 08:22.835
They're sloppy. I didn't take those.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.421
[Tench] Actually, we did see them.
There's one of them...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.006
Holden, maybe you can find it.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.892
[Holden] Did you take this picture?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.062
I don't remember.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.565
Ever since the kids were small,
I get these blackouts.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.400
It's hypoglycemia, low blood sugar.

08:46.484 --> 08:50.112
I could walk off the roof of a building
and not know it.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.699
You see that?

08:55.159 --> 08:56.827
That's you in the photo.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.455
Which means you took this photo.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.916
Which means you killed that girl.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.546
Boy, oh, boy.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.465
Kemper was right.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.300
Kemper?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.427
[Brudos] He said you guys were idiots.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.224
But I'd call you fucking morons.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.184
[chuckles]

09:20.268 --> 09:22.478
Big Ed with his big mouth.

09:23.312 --> 09:28.859
I bet you swallowed
every fucking line that came out of him.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.403
And he must have loved it.

09:30.486 --> 09:34.448
Wait a minute. As far as I know,
all his communication is monitored.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.158
What can I say?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.411
Prisons are like knitting circles.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.456
Word gets around. [laughs]

09:46.919 --> 09:48.546
Fuck if I know. We should find out.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.799
Well, yeah. It's got to affect the study
if our subjects are all pen pals.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.010
I'll call the superintendent at Vacaville.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.886
Or let's just go back and ask.

09:56.637 --> 10:00.057
What are the chances
the warden's gonna know what's going on?

10:00.141 --> 10:01.434
You might as well call.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.644
Do you really think
that Kemper called us idiots?

10:04.228 --> 10:05.855
It doesn't sound like Ed to me.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.319
We could phone Kemper, ask him directly.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.655
-Ask him if he called us idiots?
-If he talks to Brudos.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.616
Then we would be idiots.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.327
Excuse me.
I believe I'm in the middle seat.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.288
Oh, yeah? Well, that's all right.
You can have the aisle.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.957
[man] Yes, but that's the seat number
on my ticket.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.127
It's okay. My partner and I need to talk,
works out for both of us.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.090
I really think it's best
if I sat in the seat that's on my ticket.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.266
Thank you.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.822
Hey, Holden.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.325
Does this turn you on?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.036
[Holden] Oh...

11:02.119 --> 11:04.246
-[Tench] But it's sexy, right?
-[Holden] Well, no.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.956
How different is it from this?

11:07.958 --> 11:09.585
I'd say it's pretty different.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.587
To us, maybe.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.255
This one...

11:13.339 --> 11:15.758
This could be in  Playboy,  easy.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.178
Movies, TV.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.305
Classic damsel in distress.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.809
So what are you saying,
advertising creates psychos?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.310
All men are pervs?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.813
No, but sex is our trigger.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.773
I'm sure Wendy has a theory.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.567
But this? This is how we get to him.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.032
Please. I can switch with you.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.201
I'm enjoying the leg room.

11:45.454 --> 11:49.959
[Brudos on tape]  What can I say?
Prisons are like knitting circles.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.628
Word gets around.  [laughing]

11:55.005 --> 11:56.715
-Fascinating.
-You think so?

11:59.093 --> 12:01.595
Hypoglycemia? Is he lying or denying?

12:01.679 --> 12:02.888
My vote's with lying.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.891
We can learn from what he doesn't tell us.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.227
You're not always going to get
a Chatty Cathy like Kemper.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.271
Well, yeah,
the whole talking to Kemper thing.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.898
We called around.
There's no evidence they were in touch.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.651
-Which doesn't mean they haven't.
-God, if only...

12:16.110 --> 12:18.154
If they're corresponding,
it could screw up our thing.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.071
Really?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.740
[Holden] How is the study valid
if our subjects can compare notes?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.660
Wouldn't it be... cross-contamination?

12:24.743 --> 12:26.620
What would these two guys talk about?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.706
Would Brudos share with Kemper
everything he's done?

12:29.373 --> 12:32.168
These are two organized killers,
but they're on opposite sides

12:32.251 --> 12:34.253
of the spectrum when it comes to
what they'll admit.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.088
Kemper is overly forthcoming.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.258
Brudos denies everything,
even when confronted with evidence.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.803
It's a new behavior to sort by:

12:42.887 --> 12:46.056
post-conviction admission
or non-admission of guilt.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.141
You're excited about this.

12:48.058 --> 12:48.893
I am.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.562
[Tench] We didn't get anything useful
out of that prick.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.688
I'm telling you, you did.

12:52.771 --> 12:56.233
Maybe in an academic sense,
but this isn't only about your study.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.443
[Carr]  My  study?

12:57.526 --> 13:00.029
Once we've collected all the data,
we can all apply it.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.822
You mean, in four years?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.657
I need coffee.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.708
-The way he lies is very interesting.
-How so?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.210
Well, it's just so exaggerated.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.086
He can't possibly expect you
to believe him.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.922
We called him on a lie,
showed him evidence,

13:18.005 --> 13:19.423
and that ended the interview.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.091
So don't back him into a corner.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.761
Guys, post-conviction sorting?
What good is that?

13:23.844 --> 13:25.930
We need pre-apprehension info, not post.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.682
You know, Bill,
all categories are important

13:28.766 --> 13:30.518
for cross-referencing and sorting.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.229
I bet you dinner
that this guy's got more to add.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.108
You read the story about the girl
he held at knifepoint when he was 15?

13:38.192 --> 13:40.486
Made her undress, took pictures,
locked her in a corncrib.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.530
Then pretended to be his own twin brother.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.156
Right. And he talked all about Jerry.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.325
-That shows how fucked up he is.
-Maybe.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.827
There's something about disguise,
pretending to be someone else.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.454
It gives him room for what?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.958
He said he started blacking out
when his kids were small.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.293
So he isn't averse
to talking about his family.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.045
Bill, you could talk about your son.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.713
-No.
-Try.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.465
I'm not discussing my son with him.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.218
Well, you don't have to talk
about your family. You can make one up.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.053
It's just about building rapport.

14:06.136 --> 14:10.099
And he asked for stuff,
cigarettes and pizza. Indulge him.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.522
-When do you want to go back?
-I don't.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.065
Next week?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.068
Sure.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.828
Hey, Holden. I asked a buddy of mine
with the Portland PD.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.954
You might want to...

14:33.664 --> 14:34.623
On two.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.215
[line ringing]

14:48.971 --> 14:51.181
-[woman]  Hello?
-Mrs. Cooke?

14:51.265 --> 14:53.058
-Yes?
-[whispers] Who's Mrs. Cooke?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.561
-Mrs. Darcie Cooke?
-Yes?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.731
Hi. My name is Bill Tench,
I'm with the FBI.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.276
Is this about Jer?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.987
About your ex-husband, Mr. Brudos.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.324
[sighs]  Am I required to talk to you?

15:08.407 --> 15:11.035
Well, no, but I only have
a couple of questions.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.996
I'm sorry,
I changed my last name for a reason.

15:14.079 --> 15:14.914
[line disconnects]

15:19.335 --> 15:21.420
She said, "Is this about Jer?"

15:21.921 --> 15:22.880
"Jer."

15:24.632 --> 15:27.426
Those shirts looked good on you.
I can't believe you didn't buy them.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.261
I don't like patterns.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.264
You know you dress the same
off-duty as on-duty?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.974
I'm wearing plain clothes.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.976
Yeah, plain is right.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.233
-[Debbie] Ooh...
-[Holden] No.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.199
[man] Seven and a half.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.035
-Are you sure? I usually wear a seven.
-Hmm.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.371
Your shoes been a little tight lately?

15:56.163 --> 15:57.957
[Debbie] My boots, maybe, a little.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.877
Okay. Tell you what. I'll bring out
seven-and-a-half in all these.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.589
Yes, please. Are my feet getting bigger?

16:07.091 --> 16:09.969
Well, it's just half a size.
It's not that big a deal.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.303
I don't want big feet.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.391
-You do not have big feet.
-That's right, and I don't want them.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.521
-No way.
-Come on.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.564
I don't need new shoes.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.233
Please.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.250
-You look bitchin'.
-Can I take it off now?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.669
-You don't like them?
-I look like a Village Person.

16:43.752 --> 16:44.753
Ugh! Holden.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.931
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.435
Could you tell me the largest size
you have of that shoe?

17:00.060 --> 17:00.894
[man] That one?

17:00.978 --> 17:03.272
-Yeah.
-I'm not sure. I have to go take a look.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.190
Could you put a pair on hold for me?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.109
Sure.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.542
[laughing]

17:35.679 --> 17:37.306
Hello, ladies.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.391
Back for more?

17:39.475 --> 17:40.809
Tell us where to sit.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.146
[Holden] That won't
be necessary this time.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.190
Great.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.612
Want to arm wrestle?

17:53.197 --> 17:54.406
How about a smoke?

17:55.616 --> 17:57.242
Well, well, well.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.330
I want him to light me.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.169
How'd you get that scar?

18:08.545 --> 18:09.838
Darcie...

18:09.922 --> 18:13.008
found out I was chasing skirt at OSU.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.636
-Came after me with a Ginsu.
-No, really.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.012
God's truth.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.765
She loved horror films.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.017
We'd appreciate honesty.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.310
About my scar?

18:25.646 --> 18:28.065
We know that you've been jumped in here
a few times.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.775
[laughs]

18:29.858 --> 18:32.986
If you got all the answers,
what do you need from me?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.656
-We want details.
-We want to know why.

18:35.739 --> 18:36.573
[Brudos] Why what?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.242
Let's start with the women's clothes.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.285
Could you be more specific?

18:40.369 --> 18:45.165
In her testimony, your wife said
you approached her dressed as a woman.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.834
Hmm... she said...

18:48.293 --> 18:50.879
whatever the police wanted her to say.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.924
But you did approach her
dressed as a woman.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.634
-Are you married?
-[Tench] Yeah.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.178
-What's your wife's name?
-None of your business.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.847
I appreciate honesty.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.433
Nancy.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.813
How does Nancy deal with things
that she doesn't understand?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.148
I don't follow.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.983
Let's just say, my wife...

19:12.776 --> 19:14.611
was less than adventurous.

19:14.695 --> 19:18.157
-You were young when you got married.
-Twenty-two. She was 17.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.826
-What was it about her?
-She popped my cherry.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.369
[laughs] That seems old-fashioned.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.705
You married the first girl
you had sex with?

19:24.788 --> 19:27.082
It wasn't that unusual in 1961.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.794
But you had... "interests" by then.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.630
Stealing lingerie off of clotheslines.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.717
You photographed a neighborhood girl
naked when you were 15.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.469
Just a healthy, red-blooded American male.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.972
-What about the shoes?
-[Brudos] What shoes?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.307
In your garage.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.933
-The women's shoes.
-Ah.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.352
The wife loved to shop.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.772
There were nearly a hundred pairs.
Most of them size 16.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.192
[Brudos] Ah, those.
Friends sent those to me.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.860
-Friends?
-That's right.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.820
[Tench] Why would friends send you shoes?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.576
Started as a goof. Got out of hand.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.619
That's interesting.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.748
-What's that?
-Hmm?

20:10.584 --> 20:12.544
A reward for honesty.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.589
[Tench] Come on, Jerry.
Your friends didn't send you those shoes.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.842
What can I say, I'm a collector.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.010
Do you wear them?

20:20.093 --> 20:21.595
I don't have to.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.639
Don't have to, to what?

20:24.264 --> 20:26.099
-You know.
-Get off.

20:27.017 --> 20:27.851
He's adorable.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.145
I thought wearing them
was part of the allure?

20:32.272 --> 20:35.525
-Why's he so interested?
-I'm really just asking for Darcie.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.153
She still doesn't get it.
We caught up on the phone.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.738
-Right.
-Nice woman.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.241
My wife...

20:43.075 --> 20:44.409
wouldn't talk about me.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.327
Ex-wife.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.412
[Brudos]
She had to divorce me to protect the kids.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.997
And change her last name?

20:50.457 --> 20:53.043
I'm sure it makes it
easier for them in school.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.962
[Tench] What would they say
to their friends?

20:55.045 --> 20:58.131
Not just about the murders.
How do you explain the cross-dressing?

20:58.215 --> 21:00.425
"Dad's a tranny? Dad's a fag?"

21:00.509 --> 21:01.969
Fuck you, man.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.346
How does it fucking work with the shoes?

21:05.055 --> 21:07.599
He is dying to know.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.144
I'll pass it along to Darcie.
Ten years later, she's still confused.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.273
-Give her my love.
-I'll do that... Jer.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.194
Tony! Hey!

21:19.861 --> 21:21.363
-Get in here!
-What are you doing?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.406
[Brudos] Go fuck yourselves.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.908
-[Tench] They're just questions.
-I've had enough.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.243
-[Tony] What's going on?
-[Brudos] I'm done.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.911
-Wait a minute.
-[Brudos] I'm done!

21:27.995 --> 21:29.830
Bill, tell him.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.916
We didn't talk to your stupid wife.
She hung up on us.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.835
[Holden] And you're forgetting something.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.692
Ah...

22:00.068 --> 22:01.153
Brand new.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.572
[Holden]
They're the biggest size they had.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.749
You should have brought me
a pair of Nancy's.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.459
-Fuck you.
-[Brudos] Fuck you.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.182
So when did it start,
your interest in women's shoes?

22:30.265 --> 22:32.184
It didn't start. It was always there.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.522
There must have been a moment
during puberty when it became... sexual.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.733
I got my first pair of heels at five.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.692
Five?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.987
-Five years old?
-[Brudos] Stilettos.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.490
Found them in the junkyard,
brought 'em home.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.574
[Holden] Why?

22:47.657 --> 22:50.702
Never seen anything like 'em before,
except in pictures.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.621
Didn't your mom wear heels?

22:52.704 --> 22:53.705
Never.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.125
What'd she think
when you brought them home?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.219
One time,
my mom walked in on me jacking off.

23:07.969 --> 23:08.929
Came into my bedroom.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.390
-I hadn't locked the door.
-Really?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.934
-Yeah.
-What'd she do?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.269
I'd never seen her so shocked.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.231
It's like I was doing something
too horrible to even imagine.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.857
She thought I needed help.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.235
She offered to help?

23:23.318 --> 23:27.864
-Psychological help.
-[laughs]

23:27.948 --> 23:31.827
-My mom burned the shoes.
-The stilettos?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.829
Dragged me into the backyard,

23:33.912 --> 23:36.164
poured kerosene all over 'em, lit 'em up.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.835
-That must have been memorable.
-She always said she wanted a girl.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.296
She wanted you to be a girl?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.590
She had my brother,
that's what she wanted next.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.717
-She told you this?
-All the time.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.053
Why was she so upset
when you brought home the shoes?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.931
I was wearing 'em around the house.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.393
[Holden] Were you trying to be
what she wanted you to be?

23:56.476 --> 23:57.310
What?

23:57.978 --> 24:00.188
Were you trying to be a girl?

24:02.983 --> 24:06.361
Fuck no, I never wanted to be a girl.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.989
I liked the shoes.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.658
I didn't know why she was so angry.

24:11.741 --> 24:15.078
I took a pair of my teacher's shoes,
and she didn't lose her fucking mind.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.246
Your teacher's shoes?

24:16.329 --> 24:18.206
Mrs. Kernegan. First grade.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.335
-She'd kick her shoes off under the desk.
-Heels?

24:22.419 --> 24:25.255
Low, but stylish.
She checked our book bags.

24:25.338 --> 24:28.216
When she found them on me,
I thought she'd go berserk,

24:28.300 --> 24:31.136
but... she was just curious.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.221
-About what?
-Why I had taken them.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.228
Women always want to know, don't they?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.356
-At least they think they do.
-Did Darcie want to know?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.695
It's tricky when you're married.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.282
You either have to deny yourself or...

24:52.866 --> 24:54.409
keep a private space.

24:54.492 --> 24:55.619
Like a golf course.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.912
[Brudos chuckles]

24:57.829 --> 25:00.498
I put a lock on the garage,
installed an intercom

25:00.582 --> 25:03.001
so she could call in
if she needed something from the freezer.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.046
-Wouldn't want her finding your trophies.
-[laughs]

25:08.006 --> 25:11.468
She would not have wanted that.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.489
[Brudos panting]

25:37.410 --> 25:38.620
[Tench] What the fuck?

25:43.333 --> 25:44.167
Tony!

25:44.876 --> 25:47.254
-That was amazing.
-Yeah, that was great.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.422
All that shit
about his mom burning the shoes.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.465
Uh-huh.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.425
The high heels worked.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.802
You could say that.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.762
Let me ask you something.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.431
Was that true about your mom
walking in on you?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.892
-Yeah.
-It didn't bother you, using that?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.562
Who doesn't have a weird story
about their mom and sex?

26:03.853 --> 26:07.649
You're telling a private, personal story
to a murderous asshole.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.653
It bothered me.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.913
-Is this about Nancy?
-[Tench scoffs]

26:25.542 --> 26:26.376
Nothing wrong with--

26:26.459 --> 26:28.378
If what we're doing
doesn't get under your skin,

26:28.461 --> 26:30.922
you're more screwed up than I thought
or kidding yourself.

26:48.857 --> 26:52.569
You're just like a son to me.
You never did nothing I told you to do.

26:54.779 --> 26:58.491
[man 2]  Hey, Archie. We want you
and Ma to come visit us out there.

26:59.367 --> 27:02.537
[Archie]  Well, maybe your mother-in-law
can do that, but, you know...

27:02.621 --> 27:04.623
[TV continues indistinctly]

27:53.004 --> 27:54.547
[water runs]

27:55.924 --> 27:57.509
[cat meowing]

28:22.242 --> 28:23.076
Hello?

28:25.412 --> 28:27.455
-[cat meows]
-Where are you?

29:54.542 --> 29:57.003
[Nancy on phone]
They almost said it was our fault.

29:57.086 --> 30:00.757
Jesus, Nancy. I don't know what to say.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.259
Well, I was hoping
for a little more than that.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.178
I can't talk about this now. Okay?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.764
Brian's teacher thinks we're not
paying enough attention to this.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.433
That's why he's acting out.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.102
-We have to do something.
-[Tench] Uh-huh.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.648
Is that a "Uh-huh, I know,"
or is that "Uh-huh, uh-huh"?

30:16.731 --> 30:18.066
The first.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.945
You want to go
to Lamplighter tonight or not?

30:22.028 --> 30:24.197
Sure. But why are you being like this?

30:24.280 --> 30:26.991
Like I said, I really can't talk
about this now. Okay?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.244
-Did you finish it?
-I did.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.330
It's pretty great, right?

30:32.413 --> 30:34.499
Can you believe
what he said about his mom?

30:37.377 --> 30:39.212
-Did you listen to it?
-Mm-hmm.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.258
What's in the box?

30:43.341 --> 30:45.802
Holden's idea. You figure it out?

30:45.885 --> 30:47.512
I'm guessing shoes.

30:47.595 --> 30:48.847
[Tench] He got an erection.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.474
-Isn't that what you wanted?
-We wanted to get him talking.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.310
No, you baited him with those shoes
and you lied to him about his wife.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.146
He pulled that bullshit about Kemper,
so we used the same tactic.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.608
-So it was revenge?
-No. Speaking his language.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.986
This is a scientific study,
not a locker room hazing.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.487
-Let me explain.
-[Carr] Please.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.948
Guys communicate in a certain way.

31:07.031 --> 31:10.368
It can be rough, but it's like a code,
it gets out the conflict.

31:10.451 --> 31:12.745
Well, thank you for illuminating me
on male rituals.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.164
You threw our questionnaire
right out the window.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.833
Your questionnaire, which wasn't working.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.919
All you wanted to do was force him
to admit that he wears women's clothes.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.046
Yeah, get under his disguise.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.257
[Tench] Cross-dressing
is part of his psychology.

31:24.340 --> 31:28.011
His fixation on women's clothes,
women's bodies, wanting to own them,

31:28.094 --> 31:29.470
wanting to inhabit them.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.265
If we can understand that,
we can recognize it in another killer.

31:32.348 --> 31:36.060
Cross-dressing is not an antecedent
to homicidal behavior.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.020
I didn't say that.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.689
For most people,
it's a harmless form of expression.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.274
-Most people?
-Those who do it.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.527
But it's usually sexual, right?
And we know sex drives our subjects.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.820
It's sometimes sexual.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.489
Transvestism has been practiced
in every era,

31:48.573 --> 31:49.908
-in every human culture.
-Come on.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.993
If you want to teach a class,
go back to Boston.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.745
No, you weren't speaking his language.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.832
You were persecuting him about something
that challenges your masculinity.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.709
-What?
-That interview was personal.

31:59.792 --> 32:02.670
-No, this is personal.
-Guys.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.380
-You're being irrational.
-Oh, Jesus.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.965
-Where's this coming from?
-I don't know.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.509
Maybe shock
at your total lack of objectivity.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.178
-We were supposed to be objective?
-Mm-hmm.

32:10.261 --> 32:13.598
I seem to remember you encouraging us
to use our families to get to him.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.017
-How objective is that?
-We have to use strategies.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.895
I said use fake information,
as long as you establish rapport--

32:18.978 --> 32:21.522
[Tench] That's not what you said.
And it's not possible.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.901
It is not possible to communicate
with someone like Brudos and be fake.

32:24.984 --> 32:29.030
We can hassle him or we can open up
to him, but either option has a cost.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.410
[slow jazz playing]

32:34.494 --> 32:35.870
[Nancy] Musical therapy.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.790
She comes highly recommended.

32:38.873 --> 32:41.376
She has like ten years of experience-- Oh.

32:48.007 --> 32:48.925
Thank you.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.388
The only thing is,
she's in Charlottesville.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.182
I looked for someone in D.C.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.394
You'd think they'd have
music therapists in D.C.

32:59.477 --> 33:04.148
with all the politicians' kids there,
but maybe it's considered too alternative.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.027
I don't know that she's a hippie.
I only talked to her on the phone.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.197
But she... she sounded very nice.

33:11.906 --> 33:12.907
Professional.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.284
[song ends]

33:20.206 --> 33:21.749
I could drive him there once a week.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.710
Maybe even get him out of school
a little early,

33:23.793 --> 33:26.796
which could also be a good thing,
after what happened today.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.176
-How much is she?
-Forty-five.

33:33.594 --> 33:34.846
An hour?

33:34.929 --> 33:36.264
An hour and a half.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.685
-Nancy, that's a lot.
-You spend that much on a golf club.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.105
Yeah, but when you buy a club,
you have the club.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.528
I got a recommendation
for a child psychologist in Woodbridge,

33:50.611 --> 33:51.696
much closer.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.866
-You got a recommendation? When?
-Mm-hmm.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.576
About a month ago.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.869
Why didn't you tell me?

33:58.369 --> 34:00.663
Because I really don't want
to send him to a shrink.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.040
-Me neither.
-But at that price,

34:02.123 --> 34:04.792
I'd rather send him to a doctor
than some hippie musician.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.378
Please. This is not about the money.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.546
Of course not.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.049
I was...

34:12.050 --> 34:13.134
[sighs]

34:14.761 --> 34:16.679
I was hoping it wouldn't go this far.

34:53.633 --> 34:54.926
It's a private school.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.304
If he keeps biting other children,
he's gonna get kicked out.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.848
He's getting bullied,
so he's defending himself.

35:01.307 --> 35:04.477
-We should have held him back a year.
-I don't think that's the problem.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.522
He's fine with me, he's great with Julie.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.655
I've read a couple of books
which recommend music therapy

35:15.738 --> 35:17.657
when a child needs
communication training.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.785
"Communication training."
Is that what the books call it?

35:20.868 --> 35:22.995
Sure describes what we need.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.791
I'm exhausted, Nancy.
Could we table this for tonight?

35:31.462 --> 35:33.506
[man on TV]  Looks like
we gotta do it ourselves.

35:33.589 --> 35:34.882
Let's work on these ropes.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.051
[door opens]

35:37.135 --> 35:38.010
Hi, Julie.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.971
[man on TV]  It's no use!

35:40.054 --> 35:42.598
[Nancy sighs]
We're home a little early tonight.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.394
Hey.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.312
Is everything okay?

35:49.063 --> 35:50.064
Is Brian all right?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.315
He's asleep.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.318
Did something happen?

35:54.402 --> 35:57.655
When I was putting him to bed,
I found something under it.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.782
-What did you find?
-[Tench] I don't have change,

35:59.866 --> 36:01.159
so here's a little bonus.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.540
[Nancy] She found this under Brian's bed.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.959
[sighs]

36:12.086 --> 36:13.254
Julie, I'm so sorry.

36:13.796 --> 36:17.049
You know I'm an FBI agent.
I work on some rough cases.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.927
He must have got this out of my office.
I should lock that file cabinet.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.013
Honey, you shouldn't have had to see that.

36:22.096 --> 36:23.181
Brian saw it, too.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.223
Of course.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.185
-We really messed up.
-I messed up.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.436
He gets into things.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.937
[Nancy] We need
to keep a closer eye on him.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.523
-We'll find a way to explain it.
-I'll talk to him,

36:32.607 --> 36:34.066
make sure he understands
there's nothing wrong.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.612
-Nothing's wrong?
-Honey, come here.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.240
-Are you all right?
-Um...

36:41.324 --> 36:45.077
I've been meaning to tell you, my parents
want me to get some real job experience,

36:45.161 --> 36:47.788
so I'm applying at the mall and--

36:47.872 --> 36:50.708
But you'd still be able
to sit for us sometimes, right?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.085
I think it's going to be hard.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.504
[Nancy] Julie, honey...

36:56.172 --> 36:57.715
you've been with us for years.

36:58.341 --> 36:59.717
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tench.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.052
Don't forget your money.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.973
Please say goodbye to Brian for me.

37:06.933 --> 37:07.808
Julie--

37:09.810 --> 37:11.062
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

37:13.689 --> 37:17.401
I know that file cabinet has a lock.
I just have to find the key.

37:18.569 --> 37:19.862
Or get a new one.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.989
That one's 20 years old.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.243
Kid's kind of a Houdini, though.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.119
Maybe I should get a safe.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.122
Why is it in the house at all?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.001
It's work.
I have to bring it home sometimes.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.462
That? You have to bring that home?

37:37.713 --> 37:38.923
What do you do with it?

37:39.674 --> 37:41.676
Examine it for clues.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.513
You don't tell me a thing
about what you do.

37:46.097 --> 37:46.931
Now you know why.

37:47.473 --> 37:49.684
-You don't need to protect me.
-I'm trying to protect everybody.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.061
No, you need to protect your son.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.523
What was he doing in my office
in the first place?

37:56.524 --> 38:00.111
We can't watch him every second.
He's always trying to get in there.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.612
Because he knows it's not allowed.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.615
-I should put a lock on the door.
-He's trying to get closer to you!

38:05.783 --> 38:07.618
Sometimes I find him in our closet.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.538
He's putting on your ties.
He's walking around in your shoes.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.876
I'm here on the weekends now.
I'm putting in the time.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.380
When you're not at the golf course,
you're angling to get there.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.508
When you're playing with him,
you check your watch.

38:22.591 --> 38:25.845
-Well, to be honest, he's not much fun.
-He's not much fun?!

38:25.928 --> 38:27.972
I know how that sounds, but I've tried.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.267
-He's just not interested.
-It takes more than turning up, Bill.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.104
Okay, you... you need to play with him.

38:35.187 --> 38:38.232
I can't have a conversation with him.
I can't get a hug out of him.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.234
I can't even get him
to look me in the eye.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.486
-He is not beyond hope.
-Well, maybe I am.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.488
Want to know what I do?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.907
Want to see what I work on every night?
Come on.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.994
That's the tip of the iceberg.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.789
A young mother with a boy Brian's age.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.750
Killer did the same thing to him.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.419
You want to see that photo?
I got it here somewhere.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.463
This one's interesting.

39:00.546 --> 39:03.257
A woman who was stabbed,
raped, breasts cut off.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.010
Turns out it was her boyfriend,
his brother, and their sister.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.386
A little family affair.

39:08.095 --> 39:11.349
Here's the one I'm working on now.
Lovely guy by the name of Jerry Brudos.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.559
Murdered four women
not much older than Julie.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.436
Strung them up in his garage.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.939
One of them came to his door accidentally.
One of them had car trouble.

39:19.023 --> 39:23.319
One of them he grabbed from a parking
garage on her way to lunch with her mom.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.374
I'm sorry.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.209
I know.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.089
I'm sorry.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.124
[cat meows]

41:00.207 --> 41:02.209
[tuna can rattles softly]

41:11.844 --> 41:13.429
[knock on door]

41:15.723 --> 41:16.891
Your favorite...

41:18.976 --> 41:20.478
Quantico Blend.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.398
Thank you.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.863
-The mom.
-Hmm?

41:30.946 --> 41:32.698
The mom and the shoes.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.742
Something happened there.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.578
Clearly.

41:40.122 --> 41:41.207
What was it?

41:42.082 --> 41:43.209
Her reaction?

41:47.463 --> 41:48.631
The force of it.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.718
Burning the shoes
seared them into his mind as forbidden.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.764
Which became part of the sexual fantasy.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.644
Then the teacher had
an entirely different reaction.

42:01.852 --> 42:06.148
So he's getting mixed messages
from two adult women about his impulses.

42:09.068 --> 42:13.280
Brudos said that he was attracted
to women's shoes before all of that.

42:14.281 --> 42:16.575
He took the stilettos from the dump
when he was five.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.954
Not everyone agrees
with Freud's theories on sexuality,

42:20.037 --> 42:23.999
but he did hit upon how young we are
when we start to form preferences.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.501
So when did that come in?

42:26.627 --> 42:28.796
How did it get tied to his sexuality?

42:29.255 --> 42:32.383
Was there a point at which someone
could have... intervened?

42:32.466 --> 42:34.385
Well, you're asking the right questions.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.178

Hey, Bill. I've been thinking
about another angle with Brudos.

about deflecting responsibility?

[man]  Fairfield Police Department.

43:13.591 --> 43:17.303
May I speak with Detective McGraw?
This is Bill Tench with the FBI.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.513
-He's out right now. Can I take a message?
-Yes.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.433

from the Ada Jeffries case.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.018
-Ada Jeffries?
-[Tench] That's right.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.729
Tell him to look at the knots
that were used to tie her up.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.982
They're nautical
and Fairfield is landlocked.

43:30.524 --> 43:32.276
-Okay, I'll let him know.
-Thank you.

43:32.359 --> 43:35.571
-You're back on Fairfield?
-[Tench] We said we'd take a look.

about remaining objective,

43:51.503 --> 43:53.213
you were right, it's bullshit.

43:53.797 --> 43:54.965
It's very hard.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.925
I've been around crazy.

43:57.009 --> 43:58.510
I was in the army.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.262
Road School was a cakewalk.

44:00.346 --> 44:05.100
I didn't mind talking about this stuff.
But what the fuck did I even know?

44:05.184 --> 44:09.229
[Carr] These people are extremely damaged,
and they know how to cause damage.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.738
-I'm talking to you.
-No, a professional.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.406
You are professional.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.241
I'm your coworker.
I can't be your therapist.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.578
