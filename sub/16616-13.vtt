00:01.752 --> 00:04.755
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:08.050
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:11.637
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:17.476
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.355
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:22.898
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:24.525
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:29.947
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.748
Ugh. This is going to suck.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.959
Eighty percent of these acts
are either air guitar

00:42.042 --> 00:44.002
or girls dancing to songs from <i>Frozen.</i>

00:44.169 --> 00:46.129
Yeah, back in my day
you had to be a triple threat

00:46.213 --> 00:47.798
to even get on that stage.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.050
- You were a triple threat?
- I sure was.

00:50.175 --> 00:53.804
I could sing, dance, and guess the weight
of any baby that was tossed to me.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.684
<i>I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>

00:58.809 --> 00:59.810
Eight pounds.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.603
<i>Yankee Doodle do or die</i>

01:01.687 --> 01:02.729
Twelve-nine. A big one.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.149
<i>A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.443
<i>Born on the Fourth of July</i>

01:08.569 --> 01:11.321
Three pounds.
Someone couldn't wait to be here.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.291
Did that really happen?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.209
Nah, I just lip synced <i>Born to Run.</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:28.463
The show is about to start.
Is Daddy still parking the car?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.883
Yes. Everything takes him longer
these days.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.926
His cataracts are getting worse.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.971
Hey, Lois, look over there,
it's Jessica Chastain.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.808
Oh, Daddy, that's Bryce Dallas Howard.
You're blind as a bat.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.575
<i>Okay, for the first</i>
<i>of our 65 performances tonight...</i>

01:57.743 --> 01:59.161
- You got to be kidding me?
- Son of a bitch!

01:59.244 --> 02:03.540
<i>I agree. Now, please, welcome</i>
<i>Meg Griffin and Ruth Cockhammer.</i>

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
<i>- No laughing.</i>
- It's Cochammer.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.085
<i>Not in the boys' room, it isn't.</i>

02:12.424 --> 02:15.135
<i>One, two, three, to the four</i>

02:15.219 --> 02:17.721
<i>Meg Meggy Megg</i>
<i>and Dr. Ruth is at the door</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:21.266
<i>Wake up, people! Monsanto is poisoning</i>
<i>the world with Frankenfoods</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:22.518
<i>and we're letting it happen.</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:24.561
<i>Monsanto equals murder!</i>
<i>Monsanto equals murder!</i>

02:24.645 --> 02:26.230
<i>Monsanto equals murder!</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:28.982
That's enough.
I am so sick of this being used

02:29.066 --> 02:31.568
as a platform
to attack genetically modified foods.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.362
You can't silence the truth!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.365
- What? What?
- It's over, Paddy.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.075
Hi, Patty. I like Patty.

02:41.745 --> 02:46.583
<i>Okay, up next here is Evelyn Fong,</i>
<i>our 11-year-old high school junior.</i>

03:04.393 --> 03:06.603
- Oh, my God.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.688
What is that?

03:07.896 --> 03:11.149
It's... It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.734
It's a violin, Peter.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.404
<i>And now, two football players</i>
<i>are going to do something</i>

03:15.487 --> 03:17.781
<i>that only makes sense</i>
<i>to the rest of the football team.</i>

03:18.532 --> 03:19.950
Coach, the bus is here.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.910
This is an away game?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.622
Oh, it's true! Remember that happened?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.584
Those are the kids
I bought beer for.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.253
- I gotta take a leak.
- Daddy, you can't see,

03:31.336 --> 03:33.714
- let me help you to the bathroom.
- I can see fine.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.759
All right, there's only so many seats
on the bus.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.179
One of you will have to sit next to me.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.471
I will, Coach.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.392
Oh! He talks on the whole bus ride!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.732
- How are you, gentlemen?
- Dude, what the hell?

03:52.191 --> 03:55.652
Whoa! With cataracts like those
someone needs a big pair of glasses.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.197
Hey! Jessica Chastain.

04:02.951 --> 04:06.163
I'm glad you finally agreed to have
the cataract surgery, Daddy.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.416
I wish I hadn't, I can't see
anything now. This is terrible.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.961
Well, that... That's why
the whole family came to support you.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.254
Oh, really?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.173
Oh, wow, that's so kind. Who's here?

04:16.381 --> 04:18.467
Oh, uh, well, as you know, I'm here.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.720
- Who else?
- Stewie and Brian.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.305
Hey, hope you feel better soon.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.682
That doesn't sound like the whole family.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.519
Hey, hope those eyes
get better soon, Pop.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.854
It's me, Peter. Shipoopi.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.691
- Oh, thanks for coming, Peter.
-I'm here too, Grandpa.

04:35.317 --> 04:39.112
And, uh... And Meg went down
to, to put money in the meter.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.322
Ah, I don't care.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.491
Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
your vision will be impaired

04:42.574 --> 04:44.284
for a few weeks while you recover.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.495
I recommend you and your wife
have someone around

04:46.578 --> 04:47.829
to help you during this time.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.123
Well, I'd love to help you, Daddy,

04:50.207 --> 04:52.459
but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.255
- He's constantly crying for no reason.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.840
Ow! Bitch!

04:57.923 --> 04:59.258
She does this a lot.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.635
You know? Maybe Brian could help you.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.387
He could be your service dog.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.514
Come on, Lois, I don't want to do that.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.266
Your father and I have nothing in common.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.976
Brian, please.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.104
If you do this for me,
you'll be a hero just like King Arthur

05:12.229 --> 05:13.897
when he pulled the sword from the stone.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.694
Oh, yeah.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.823
Whoo! Oh, God, this is embarrassing.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.450
I'm so sorry, it's been, like, 500 years.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.287
Ah, this is your big moment
and I'm ruining it.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.712
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.214
I'm learning violin.
It's kind of like my new hobby.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.259
Well, if we're talking
about new hobbies...

05:43.343 --> 05:45.137
- What is it?
- It's a mason jar

05:45.262 --> 05:46.680
filled with layered sand.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.225
You can put it in your bathroom
or anywhere you want to feel peaceful.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.644
Now it's nothing.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.521
I always liked the violin

05:54.605 --> 05:57.316
'cause it kind of has curves like a lady.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.735
Hey, you know what? Maybe you guys
can learn an instrument too,

05:59.818 --> 06:01.069
and then we could all play together.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.030
Really? That sounds like a lot of work.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.907
Yeah, no offense, <i>muchacho,</i>

06:04.990 --> 06:07.826
but I don't know
if I have time for that, <i>muchacho.</i>

06:07.910 --> 06:09.411
Yeah, you're doing <i>muchacho</i> wrong.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.079
Come on, guys, it could be cool.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.958
I did play the oboe in high school
and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.960
Girls do like guys in a band.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.170
I'm in, giggity.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.798
Oh, Quagmire,
you are so predictable,

06:21.924 --> 06:23.884
and that's why I love you, <i>muchacho.</i>

06:23.967 --> 06:26.136
See, that's how you do <i>muchacho.</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:29.014
And you know? There's four of us,
we could be a string quartet.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.682
All right, I'll do it,

06:30.766 --> 06:32.768
but first, you guys gotta do
one thing for me.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.894
Sure, Joe, what is it?

06:33.977 --> 06:35.479
I want you to put me in the booth.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.981
I want to feel like a person for a second.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.733
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.652
All right, Quagmire, you do upper,
I'll do lower.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.778
Sure, let's do it.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.498
Wow, thanks, guys.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.000
Uh-oh.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.878
- Hey, guys, guys. Put him back up,

06:59.962 --> 07:01.129
I just thought of something.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.303
This is gonna be a blast.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.898
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
your service dog has arrived.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.275
- Hey, Carter.
- Brian.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.943
You have a butler?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.736
Then why am I here?
Why can't he help you?

07:24.862 --> 07:26.989
What? That's stupid.
Who would announce him?

07:27.072 --> 07:30.617
See, this, right here, this is the
one percenter crap I can't stand.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.036
Yes, it is.
Now sit your 99 percenter ass down

07:33.120 --> 07:34.329
and read me the comics.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.956
Ugh.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.001
Okay. <i>The Wizard of Id</i>
is addressing his subjects.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.210
Is he up on that balcony?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.796
- Yes.
- Ha-ha! Then it's a good one.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.308
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.893
Peter, what note are you playing?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.145
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar. "Note"?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.313
Haven't you been practicing?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.148
All right, fine. I haven't.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.816
But I've been doing other violin stuff,

08:03.066 --> 08:04.193
like, I bought this jacket,

08:04.276 --> 08:07.237
like what Bugs Bunny wears
when he's with that opera guy.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.990
Wow, that looks sharp.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.409
Yeah, I've been practicing
how to sit down in it.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.288
Ew! Peter, those tails are soaking wet.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.248
They may have been in the toilet.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.422
- Brian! Get in here.
- What's up? What do you need?

08:25.589 --> 08:26.840
I'm done with my bath.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.884
Put on this lady wig
and help me out of the tub.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.929
- What? Why do I have to wear a wig?
- Otherwise it's weird.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.474
Thank you, Penelope.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.684
Hey, it's 4:30, time for dinner.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.604
But first, grab that Gold Bond
and powder my speed bag.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.444
Ah, there's the tingle.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.538
Wow! So you could just bypass
all that gridlock?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.081
Having a helicopter is amazing.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.165
And that's not all.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.710
I also use it to throw boxes of frogs
down on that church.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
They go bananas.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.382
Well, I could really get used to this
rich guy stuff.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.510
<i>Funny, funny, funny</i>
<i>what money can do</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:14.596
<i>Them that have it get more of it</i>

09:14.805 --> 09:17.975
<i>The less they need it</i>
<i>The more they love it</i>

09:18.183 --> 09:21.186
<i>And it sticks to them like glue</i>

09:21.812 --> 09:25.357
<i>Funny, funny, funny, what money can do</i>

09:25.482 --> 09:28.777
<i>Ask the rich man he'll confess</i>

09:28.861 --> 09:32.072
<i>Money can't buy happiness</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:35.075
<i>Ask the poor man he don't doubt</i>

09:35.158 --> 09:37.911
<i>But he'd rather be miserable with</i>
<i>than without</i>

09:37.995 --> 09:40.956
<i>If you spend it please be wiser</i>

09:41.039 --> 09:44.168
<i>If you save it you're a miser</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:47.171
<i>You don't want it you're cuckoo</i>

09:48.422 --> 09:51.425
<i>Funny, funny, funny what money can do</i>

09:54.970 --> 09:56.263
You guys, I got great news.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.223
Some skank I used to bang
is getting married,

09:58.348 --> 10:00.100
and they need someone to play
at the ceremony.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.978
- We got our first gig.
- Wow, a weddin'. That's awesome!

10:03.145 --> 10:05.314
All right, then we should probably
practice our piece.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.702
Hold on, hold on. Peter...
That's terrible!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.746
You're sounding
like you were strangling a cat.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.165
Well, I was.
That's how I got revved up to perform.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.333
No, just now.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.752
Look, it's clear that you still
haven't practiced at all.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.087
Yeah, this was your idea
in the first place.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.923
But you're the only one
who's done no work.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.382
"No work"?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.092
I stared in the mirror for hours

10:34.176 --> 10:37.012
playing air violin to the song
<i>Bitter Sweet Symphony.</i>

10:37.221 --> 10:39.598
- Peter, you're out of the group.
- What?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.100
Well, fine. Screw you, guys.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.771
Wow, he seemed pretty angry.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.564
Yeah, I haven't seen him this upset

10:47.648 --> 10:50.192
since he got caught using that fake ID.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.569
Can I see your ID, please?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.282
Give me one second.

10:57.366 --> 11:01.245
Uh, sir, that lady who came in
and ate all the pies is back.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.709
Okay, let's see how those eyes are doing.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.003
See if you can tell me where Waldo is.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.172
He's right there buying an ice cream cone.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.716
Damn it, I've been stuck on that page
for two days.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.134
Oh, and your eyes are fine.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.928
Hey, that's terrific, Carter.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.012
Seems like it's time to go home

11:19.096 --> 11:21.473
and pour some of that scotch of yours
to celebrate.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.225
That sounds like a great idea.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.435
- See you later.
- Wait, wait. What are you talking about?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.354
I meant, like... Like both of us.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.524
Didn't you hear him? I'm all healed.
I don't need a service dog anymore.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.652
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, "I'm done with you."

11:33.735 --> 11:37.531
Now, before I go, I'm just going to
old man drink this glass of water.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.826
Ah!

11:42.828 --> 11:45.163
Ah!

11:46.832 --> 11:48.834
Ah!

11:49.084 --> 11:51.086
Now to take an old man pee.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.256
- Ow.

11:54.339 --> 11:59.261
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.762
Ow.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.264
Ow.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.682
Ow.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.100
Ow.

12:05.184 --> 12:06.351
Ow.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.644
Ow.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.812
Ow.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.230
Ow.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.648
Ow.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.151
Ow.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.618
Oh, Brian, just in time for dinner.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.286
We're having sloppy joes.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.581
- Eh. What else you got?
- How about a knuckle sandwich?

12:28.248 --> 12:31.418
If Peter said that, you all would
have lost your minds laughing.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.878
It's just that at Carter's house,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.923
if you don't want something heavy,
Etienne will whip you up an egg dish

12:36.006 --> 12:38.300
with some shallots and chanterelles
or whatever's fresh.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.469
Yeah, I know all about Etienne.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.055
He climbed into my bed when I was 11.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.891
I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri,

12:45.974 --> 12:47.226
but now you're back in the real world

12:47.309 --> 12:49.394
where our poop stinks
and we all eat garbage.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.731
Yeah, guess I got used to being
a little pampered over at Carter's.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.775
Well, I'd be careful with
your uptown ways.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.276
Some of the other kids don't like it.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.988
He thinks he's better than us.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.324
What time you going to bed, fancy boy?

13:02.407 --> 13:05.118
- I don't know, 9:00.
-"Nine o'clock," Chris.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.955
Look, it's not even about the stuff.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.082
Carter and I became friends.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.834
Wait a minute, of course.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.961
Whatever you're going to say next,
I bet it's wrong.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.130
I offended Carter
by offering to work for him.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.924
I mean, once it became a friendship,

13:19.007 --> 13:21.635
he didn't want me working for him,
he wanted a pal.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.970
Brian, you're not kidding anyone.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.763
We all know you don't care about Carter.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.181
You only care about his money.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.350
No, no. No. He knows I'm his friend.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.270
Yeah, right. That's what Woody
thought about Buzz Lightyear.

13:33.272 --> 13:36.275
Bo Peep! What's going on here?

13:36.358 --> 13:39.736
Um... You've got a friend in me.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.078
What are you doing here? I thought
you were rehearsing with the guys.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.873
Ah, the bastards kicked me out
'cause I'm not good enough.

13:50.956 --> 13:54.585
Oh, and they also taught me that
if your hand is bigger than your face,

13:54.668 --> 13:55.752
you have cancer.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.174
So maybe you should, uh,
you know, do the test.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.342
I had cancer, Peter, remember?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.553
I was in the hospital,
you weren't there for it.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.555
Well, maybe you have it again.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.557
Peter, I'm not falling for your trick.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.018
But if you're upset about the guys
kicking you out of the group,

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
you can't really blame them.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.147
The violin takes
discipline and dedication.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.357
You never even practiced.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.818
They probably thought
you were just wasting their time.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.445
Maybe you're right, I guess...

14:21.528 --> 14:23.614
I guess, I could have been
a little more serious about it.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.115
Well, it's not too late.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.743
Maybe you could find a teacher
who could help you learn.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.786
And if you work at it
and get a little better,

14:29.912 --> 14:31.580
they'll see you care about them.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.624
You know what? That's a great idea.
I'll take some lessons.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.210
I'm going to work really hard
just like my deodorant.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.921
How does a guy like me stay fresh?

14:39.004 --> 14:40.797
I use Fat Guys deodorant.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.510
Whether you're sitting, leaning,
lying down, or sitting,

14:44.593 --> 14:46.136
Fat Guys keeps you dry.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.680
Apply every five minutes
and you're good for five minutes.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.808
And now for the confusing
commercial back story.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.646
- Ready for the fund-raiser, Dad?
- Yeah, I'll be right there, buddy.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.690
We're going to a fund-raiser
and we share a bedroom.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.697
Mr. Pewterschmidt, you have a visitor.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.616
Hey, buddy, looking good.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.660
So what are we drinking? Or better yet,

15:09.743 --> 15:11.370
why aren't we drinking?

15:11.453 --> 15:13.956
Get the hell out of here!
I told you I'm done with you.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.250
And besides, I'm off to the spa
down at the club.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.253
How's the temp? Good and hot?

15:20.546 --> 15:22.381
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

15:23.048 --> 15:26.051
Hey, did you also not wash your ass
before getting in?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.137
Yeah. Fuck that sign.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.769
- There you go, Mr. Glenn.
- Thanks.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.146
Hey, can I get a couple of extras
of these plastic bags?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.190
Let me just test this out quickly.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.571
- Yeah, that works.
- Okay, now you go.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.073
I have to get back to
teaching violin lesson.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.541
Those scales sound terrible!
You fat and lazy.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.626
- You leave now!
- No, please.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.879
I got to get better
so I can be as good as my friends.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.922
I really let them down.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.927
You fingers no bleeding,
you no try hard enough.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.846
You want me press iron
on your back again?

16:10.929 --> 16:12.848
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Try harder.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.016
Play better!

16:18.020 --> 16:19.021
- Argh!

16:19.104 --> 16:21.440
Is somebody making a Cuban sandwich?

16:25.777 --> 16:28.488
Lousy, no good, rotten...

16:31.116 --> 16:34.286
Brian, what's up? Why are you
engaging in cartoon profanity?

16:34.369 --> 16:36.038
Carter wants nothing to do with me.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.332
- I'm just so mad.
- Don't you mean sad?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.917
You know, about the friendship?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.377
Oh, no. Of course,
you mean mad about the money.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.130
All right. Fine, it was about the money.
I miss the money.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.716
Yes, I know. I saw all your
Instagrams on his helicopter,

16:47.799 --> 16:49.134
like it was your helicopter.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.638
- I never said it was my helicopter.
- Yeah, you never said it wasn't.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.307
The implication was that it was
a regular part of your life.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.809
Anyway, I know this makes me sound awful

16:57.893 --> 17:01.063
but I almost wish Carter was still
blind so he'd still need me.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.523
Yeah, but he's not.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.859
But he could be.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.487
- But he isn't.
- But he should be.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.239
Oh, no.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.657
Come on, it'd be temporary.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.575
Just until he realizes I'm a great hang.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.744
But you're not,
so I don't want any part of this.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.747
Okay, I get it, I get it.
You wouldn't want to help me out.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.166
What was I thinking?
He's your grandfather...

17:21.250 --> 17:23.460
Even though
he did say that thing about you.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.628
What? What did he say about me?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.172
Oh, I... I'm sorry,
I thought I told you. Um...

17:27.256 --> 17:30.175
He said, you couldn't cut it
as a member of One Direction.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.135
What? But they have an opening.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.930
Zayn is gone.
He does know Zayn is gone, right?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.181
Oh, he definitely knows.

17:36.265 --> 17:39.142
Yeah, he thinks you could be
in O-Town but not One Direction.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.311
Okay, I'm pretty sure
you're manipulating me,

17:41.395 --> 17:43.105
but let's go blind that old bastard.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.950
Listen, Peter, we know you've been
working hard on the violin,

17:55.033 --> 17:57.327
but more importantly, you're our pal.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.204
We'd like you to be back in the group.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.124
Really? But what if I'm not good enough?

18:02.207 --> 18:03.417
Well, that's the thing.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.962
We decided we'd rather be lousy
with you than great without you.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.548
Joe, no offense, but I'd prefer
to hear it from someone else.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.842
- That's fair.
- So what do you say, Peter?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.677
Will you come and play the wedding
with us?

18:13.886 --> 18:15.095
Oh, you bet I will.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.514
Thanks, you guys won't regret this.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.932
And don't you worry, I'll be ready,

18:19.308 --> 18:21.810
unlike Lois getting dressed
for a night out.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.480
- Tell them the truth.
-It's me. It's me.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.316
I'm the one who takes
too long to get ready.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.151
It's 'cause I don't have any nice clothes.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.360
- Peter!
- All right.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.070
It's 'cause I don't like the way I look.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.495
Okay, Brian. Carter's in the shower.

18:40.579 --> 18:43.123
As soon as he comes out,
we spray this right in his eyes.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.291
What did you put in there, again?

18:44.374 --> 18:46.502
Oh, it's just tap water
from Flint, Michigan.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.758
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>the penis song goes...</i>

18:52.925 --> 18:54.843
Ah! Son of a bitch, my eyes!

18:55.511 --> 18:56.887
- You're up.
- Carter,

18:56.970 --> 18:58.847
what happened?
You look like you could use some help.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.265
Argh! My face!

19:03.519 --> 19:04.561
Oh, my God.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.939
What did I let money do to me?

19:07.439 --> 19:09.566
- Who did this? Who are you?
- Carter,

19:09.983 --> 19:12.486
it's me, Brian. I did this.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.737
And it's made me realize

19:13.820 --> 19:16.698
that I was blinded by luxury and comfort

19:16.782 --> 19:18.867
but now I see that none
of that matters. If I don't...

19:18.951 --> 19:20.369
Brian, Brian, hold on.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.463
Looks like we've learned a lot,
and my face is better.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.183
God, I'm so nervous.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.227
You sure
you guys want me to play with you?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.646
Yes, Peter, you play away.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.899
We're a quartet. Just do the best you can.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.734
You may kiss the bride.

20:15.299 --> 20:16.300
Mmm.

20:16.592 --> 20:17.801
Peter, that was amazing.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.970
I know. Those lessons really paid off.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.765
I'll say. The way you play, we'll have
more gigs than we can handle.

20:24.141 --> 20:27.144
Not a chance. Mr. Washee Washee
took all the joy out of this.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.230
I hate the violin.
I hate music. I hate life

20:30.397 --> 20:31.815
and I'm never doing this again.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.444
All right, guys,
let's go drink a bunch of free booze

20:35.527 --> 20:37.863
and be a huge presence
in the wedding photos.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.740
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

20:41.366 --> 20:44.995
<i>Late December back in '63</i>

20:45.871 --> 20:49.625
<i>What a very special time for me</i>

20:50.501 --> 20:53.587
<i>As I remember what a night</i>

20:56.465 --> 20:58.550
<i>Oh, what a night</i>
