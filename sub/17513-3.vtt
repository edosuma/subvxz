I just don't think in my life,
I'm ever gonna do a drum solo.

00:20.026 --> 00:21.634
- Spider check?
- Always.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.349
What are you going to
do if you found one?

00:23.526 --> 00:25.754
Set myself on fire. Drive off a cliff.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.427
Oh, you know I'm in the car.

00:28.331 --> 00:30.637
- What if it was a friendly one?
- There are no friendly ones.

00:30.642 --> 00:32.913
What if it was just coming down
'cause you had your tag sticking out?

00:32.918 --> 00:34.841
It was coming to help?
Like, "Hey, let me get

00:34.847 --> 00:36.217
- "that for you, buddy. You look like a
- No. No, don't,

00:36.222 --> 00:37.551
- "tag dag. I just wanna help."
- don't... talk about something else.

00:37.556 --> 00:38.756
Talk about something else.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.840
Do you want to talk
about the house again?

00:40.845 --> 00:42.789
You mean the house I'm going to sell?

00:43.861 --> 00:45.160
It's pretty nice.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.151
It's a great house on
a great block of land

00:47.157 --> 00:49.959
and the owner isn't asking
too much. It's perfect.

00:49.965 --> 00:51.770
I'm actually going to sell
one before Mum gets back.

00:51.775 --> 00:54.309
- You could sell this house.
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:54.315 --> 00:57.061
Well, I'm just saying someone with
as little sales experience as you,

00:57.067 --> 00:59.098
- but who is still super cool...
- Thank you.

00:59.104 --> 01:01.216
- could easily sell this place.
- Mmm.

01:02.184 --> 01:04.394
- Oh, I've already pre-written a text.
- Mmm?

01:08.335 --> 01:11.121
"Hi, Mum. Just made my
first sale." That's it?

01:11.127 --> 01:12.651
Yeah, well, that's the news.

01:15.323 --> 01:16.523
This is better.

01:16.529 --> 01:18.708
"Mum, I got an under-age girl pregnant.

01:18.714 --> 01:20.318
"Just kidding, I sold a house!"

01:20.319 --> 01:22.417
- What?
- Well, it's like double good news.

01:22.423 --> 01:23.682
It's like, "He did what?!"

01:23.688 --> 01:26.286
"Oh, he was kidding.
Phew! and he sold a house."

01:26.292 --> 01:28.197
- Please don't send that.
- I'm not gonna send it.

01:28.202 --> 01:29.925
Okay. Well, just don't push
anything that'd accidentally send it.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.683
Now you're making me paranoid
that I am gonna send it.

01:31.688 --> 01:32.729
Well, just don't touch anything.

01:32.735 --> 01:34.464
'Cause now I actually can't
remember which button's back and

01:34.469 --> 01:35.891
- which is send. Your phone is weird.
- Well, just... don't touch anything.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.346
- Is that one back or send? Can you...
- You don't have to push anything. Just,

01:37.351 --> 01:39.078
- take it away from me. No, you made me
- No, no, no, don't push anything.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.584
- worried that I'm gonna press it. How
- I'm driving. Just, put your thumbs up!

01:40.589 --> 01:41.539
- can I not push anything?
- Just, put your thumbs up!

01:41.545 --> 01:43.027
I'll put it down. My
thumbs? What? Like...

01:43.032 --> 01:44.449
- Like, now what?
- Yes.

01:44.455 --> 01:45.968
Hold it like that till we park.

02:59.436 --> 03:01.116
I just uploaded the photos he sent.

03:01.122 --> 03:02.624
What, was I supposed
to check they were real?

03:02.629 --> 03:04.358
- Yes!
- They were photos of a house.

03:04.359 --> 03:06.330
It's not like there was
a unicorn out the front.

03:07.202 --> 03:10.295
I know what you're going to
say... I haven't mowed the lawns.

03:11.154 --> 03:12.354
John...

03:12.572 --> 03:15.374
this is the photo we've
used on the website

03:15.375 --> 03:17.381
and all of the marketing material.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.333
What's the problem?

03:20.339 --> 03:22.251
Well, did you doctor this photo?

03:22.257 --> 03:24.416
No. No, my son did it.

03:24.422 --> 03:26.634
He can also do memes, whatever they are.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.305
Yeah, but, John, your house
doesn't look like this.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.510
Well, obviously.

03:29.516 --> 03:31.392
Well, you can't do that.
It's false advertising.

03:31.397 --> 03:34.229
No, it's not. It-it-it's aspirational.

03:34.235 --> 03:36.620
I mean, it's what the property could
look like if you took the time to...

03:36.625 --> 03:37.948
Take down the power lines.

03:37.954 --> 03:40.326
Well, you know, that's just
my son expressing himself.

03:40.327 --> 03:41.735
- It looks real.
- It's not.

03:42.517 --> 03:45.011
Hey, your mum said it was a fixer-upper,

03:45.017 --> 03:48.203
all right? I just wanted to show people,
you know, what it'd look like fixed up.

03:48.209 --> 03:50.759
- It's like serving suggestions.
- Yeah, but it's a house.

03:50.765 --> 03:52.218
It's not a frozen pizza.

03:52.224 --> 03:53.664
Yeah, but more people
will come this way.

03:53.669 --> 03:54.927
Angry people.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.133
I'll talk to them.

03:56.139 --> 03:59.229
Oh! No, John, y-you
shouldn't be at the open home.

04:00.432 --> 04:01.632
Why?

04:01.638 --> 04:04.386
It-it's never a good idea for the owner
to be there. It's standard practice.

04:04.391 --> 04:06.858
Yeah, but, you know, what if
they've got questions for me, like...

04:06.863 --> 04:08.241
Where's the mountain?

04:14.278 --> 04:16.498
- 14. There's 14.
- What?

04:16.504 --> 04:18.370
- Spot the difference.
- Oh.

04:18.677 --> 04:20.303
Do you want me to rewrite
that text to your mum?

04:20.308 --> 04:22.186
You may have broken the
law putting that photo up.

04:22.191 --> 04:24.390
We. I did it from your computer.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.083
Why didn't you use your computer?

04:26.089 --> 04:28.054
- What? Yeah, it was sleeping.
- You've got a computer.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.954
- Damien, hi.
- Yeah, hi.

04:30.786 --> 04:33.209
- Hi, Emma.
- How's it going?

04:33.215 --> 04:36.044
Fine. Well, I mean...

04:36.050 --> 04:38.142
no, yeah, fine. I'll say fine.

04:38.148 --> 04:39.451
Did you go round there?

04:39.457 --> 04:43.176
Yeah, I told John I could give the place
a quick paint job or do the gardens.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.716
It's really all I could do
to pretty it up by tomorrow.

04:45.722 --> 04:47.339
Okay, well, at least that's something.

04:47.345 --> 04:48.545
Can't do it, though.

04:48.551 --> 04:51.167
John won't let me touch anything
unless I buy the place first.

04:51.761 --> 04:53.067
Do you want to buy it?

04:53.244 --> 04:54.472
No.

04:55.784 --> 04:58.184
- Anything else I can do?
- Kill me.

04:58.284 --> 05:00.864
- No. Thank you, Damien.
- Right. Bye.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.070
Bye!

05:03.886 --> 05:07.164
Maybe we could call one of
those extreme makeover shows.

05:09.641 --> 05:13.081
I think he likes you.

05:13.448 --> 05:14.746
No, he doesn't.

05:14.752 --> 05:17.839
Well, he could've just called.
He didn't have to come in here.

05:17.845 --> 05:19.732
He doesn't even like leaving his house.

05:20.182 --> 05:21.382
He likes you.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.589
Maybe he likes you.

05:22.594 --> 05:24.612
- Probably. I'm a likeable guy.
- Well, I hope you're happy together.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.696
- We will be.
- What's your favourite thing about him?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.077
- Daniel...
- His eyes.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.708
Barbara's on the phone for you.

05:41.653 --> 05:44.262
- Hi, Mum.
- Daniel, what took you so long?

05:44.268 --> 05:47.192
Just, uh... working hard.

05:47.198 --> 05:48.639
- How are you?
- Fine.

05:48.645 --> 05:51.923
I've been in rehab all
morning, yelling at my physio.

05:52.021 --> 05:53.509
She's very handsy.

05:53.515 --> 05:55.603
Yeah, I think that's their job.

05:55.609 --> 05:57.501
Anyway, I'd better get back to work.

05:57.507 --> 06:00.038
Do you have everything ready
for the open home tomorrow?

06:00.896 --> 06:02.096
- Yep.
- Oh,

06:02.102 --> 06:03.870
so you've moved the mountain, have you?

06:03.876 --> 06:05.752
- I can explain that.
- Can you?

06:05.758 --> 06:08.644
'Cause it seems like you've ruined any
chance we had of selling that property.

06:08.649 --> 06:11.252
No, no, it's... it's like, um...

06:11.258 --> 06:12.698
serving suggestions.

06:12.704 --> 06:16.313
I've taken the images down and
posted a message that it's cancelled.

06:16.319 --> 06:18.501
I'll reschedule it when I'm back.

06:19.014 --> 06:20.214
Well, Mu...

06:20.717 --> 06:22.108
Love you.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.276
She knows?

06:32.878 --> 06:34.258
Yeah.

06:34.659 --> 06:36.310
Does she think I did it?

06:36.311 --> 06:37.559
You did do it.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.334
Yeah, but does she think I did it?

06:39.340 --> 06:41.977
She saw the website and she...

06:42.060 --> 06:43.640
cancelled the open home.

06:43.646 --> 06:47.358
Can't people have spinal surgery
without checking their computers?

06:47.654 --> 06:49.568
Well, something else'll come up.

06:49.574 --> 06:51.589
She's not gonna give me another chance.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.798
Do you... do you know how many
houses I sold on the mainland?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.301
Three?

06:57.307 --> 06:59.483
No, z-zero.

06:59.983 --> 07:01.995
I really thought I was
gonna sell my first one.

07:02.788 --> 07:05.330
Well, sell it, then.

07:05.331 --> 07:08.604
- She cancelled the open home.
- She cancelled it online.

07:08.610 --> 07:10.698
The people who got our
leaflets won't know that,

07:10.704 --> 07:13.363
and it was in the paper.
People might still turn up.

07:13.369 --> 07:16.496
What, furious people
when they don't see a...?

07:16.957 --> 07:18.574
Is that a hedge maze?

07:18.871 --> 07:20.983
I have two ideas.

07:22.934 --> 07:24.616
What's your second idea?

07:24.622 --> 07:28.239
Okay, well, when you're in a bad
mood, what always cheers you up?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.158
There's an interview with Bruce Lee

07:32.164 --> 07:34.814
where he talks about
honestly expressing oneself.

07:34.820 --> 07:38.039
And when I watch it,
I-I get inspired to do...

07:42.682 --> 07:44.174
Free stuff!

07:44.276 --> 07:46.174
You can't stay mad if
you're getting free stuff.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.380
Right.

07:47.386 --> 07:49.684
In Melbourne once I was walking
past this auction and they

07:49.690 --> 07:53.270
had an ice cream stand and they were
giving out free ice creams to anyone.

07:53.276 --> 07:54.684
- And do you know what?
- What?

07:54.690 --> 07:57.734
I bought that house. Most
expensive ice cream I've ever had.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.046
- You didn't buy the house.
- Uh?

07:59.054 --> 08:01.111
No, but you can see
how that could happen.

08:01.117 --> 08:04.392
Em, it's pretty common practice
to give stuff away at these things.

08:04.398 --> 08:05.962
We just don't have any money for it.

08:05.968 --> 08:09.253
Shops will donate stuff. Small
town people are generous, right?

08:09.659 --> 08:12.659
I guess we could say it's good exposure.

08:12.752 --> 08:15.086
I mean, it's free advertising for them.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.977
Well?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.109
It's worth a shot.

08:19.327 --> 08:20.709
Yay!

08:21.094 --> 08:23.892
- To Bruce Lee, the greatest singer...
- No.

08:23.898 --> 08:25.338
- Guitarist...
- Not music.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.662
- Astronaut. Good guy.
- Come on!

08:29.522 --> 08:31.635
We're technically still at work.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.203
_

08:39.208 --> 08:40.409
Ready?

08:40.414 --> 08:42.448
Okay, you take the shops on
the left side of the street

08:42.453 --> 08:44.360
- and I'll take the right.
- Okay.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.964
Does that help?

08:48.970 --> 08:50.320
- What?
- This.

08:50.683 --> 08:52.809
- Is that how I look?
- Sorry, Mrs Marsh.

08:54.906 --> 08:56.940
- What does it do?
- I don't know. I get nervous.

08:56.946 --> 08:58.785
- It shakes off the nerves.
- Oh, you'll be fine.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.518
Just relax, speak confidently.
Oh, I keep forgetting to ask you,

09:01.524 --> 09:03.409
why doesn't anyone
here talk like you do?

09:03.415 --> 09:06.657
- What do you mean?
- In Rosehaven. Like, in your hometown,

09:06.663 --> 09:08.721
I thought everyone here would
sound like you but they don't.

09:08.726 --> 09:11.510
- Like your mum says "balls".
- When did she say "bowls"?

09:11.516 --> 09:14.507
Well, I don't know, but when she says
it, she says "balls" and you don't.

09:15.303 --> 09:17.302
Emma, I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:17.303 --> 09:19.506
- You have an accent.
- No, I don't.

09:19.512 --> 09:21.119
Say "balls".

09:21.489 --> 09:24.301
- "Bowls". I said "bowls".
- No, "balls".

09:24.307 --> 09:27.381
You're not. Say, "It's
wall to wall balls."

09:27.387 --> 09:29.381
- Well, I would never have to say that.
- Just say it.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.542
It's woll to woll bowls.

09:33.259 --> 09:34.979
What's that thing you put soup in?

09:35.248 --> 09:36.452
Bowl.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.372
The round thing you play catch with?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.672
- "Bowl".
- Do you not hear that?!

09:40.860 --> 09:44.139
Say, "Put this ball in this bowl."

09:44.978 --> 09:46.871
Put this "bowl" in this bowl.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.995
- That's just how I say it.
- I always thought you had an accent,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.363
but you just can't talk properly.

09:51.369 --> 09:53.588
- I am talking properly.
- Oh, I've got one.

09:53.971 --> 09:56.015
Say this.

09:56.021 --> 09:58.624
Actually, it might kill you.
I don't know if you're ready.

10:02.406 --> 10:04.320
Bowling "bowl".

10:04.703 --> 10:07.481
I am going to get you
the help that you need.

10:07.487 --> 10:09.285
Well, I don't need help
because I've got this.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.599
Oh, you mean this?

10:10.605 --> 10:13.206
- That's what you do!
- Oh! Got me.

10:13.212 --> 10:16.086
_

10:30.612 --> 10:32.612
Hi, uh...

10:32.618 --> 10:33.818
Cathy.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.520
Uh, I'm Daniel from
McCallum Real Estate.

10:38.526 --> 10:40.892
- I'm hosting an open home tom...
- Oh, you're Barbara's boy.

10:40.897 --> 10:42.587
- Yes.
- Thought you were on the mainland.

10:42.593 --> 10:44.571
- I was.
- Couldn't hack it?

10:46.110 --> 10:48.912
Ah, I'm actually here about an
exciting cross-promotional opportunity

10:48.918 --> 10:51.804
that will, uh, raise
awareness of your brand.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.010
Meat?

10:53.892 --> 10:57.054
Yes. I was hoping to expose your
business to a... to a wider audience.

10:57.060 --> 10:58.859
What is it you want, exactly?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.374
- Sausages?
- How many?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.938
- 40?
- Fine.

11:03.944 --> 11:06.181
Great. Thank you. I'm hoping this
can be the, er, start of an ongoing

11:06.186 --> 11:08.735
- relationship between our businesses...
- That'll be $22.50.

11:08.741 --> 11:09.941
Sure.

11:16.234 --> 11:17.757
This was a great idea!

11:17.763 --> 11:20.260
- What did you get?
- Free clothes from the Op Shop.

11:20.266 --> 11:22.951
Clothes? Em, we can't say,
"Welcome to the open home.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.744
"Please accept this old jumper."

11:24.750 --> 11:27.418
Why not? They're from a
shop. They're still good.

11:27.424 --> 11:29.362
Yeah, but if the Op Shop didn't want
them, what do you think they're like?

11:29.367 --> 11:30.914
Have you... have you opened the bag yet?

11:30.919 --> 11:32.119
Nah.

11:33.355 --> 11:34.843
Eugh! Oooh...

11:35.148 --> 11:37.354
- It's just a bit mothy.
- What'd you get?

11:37.699 --> 11:39.698
- 40 sausages.
- Score!

11:39.704 --> 11:40.988
I paid for 'em.

11:40.994 --> 11:44.094
Okay, strike one and two. We're
still in the game. Come on.

11:53.455 --> 11:54.655
_

12:11.968 --> 12:14.819
_

12:24.851 --> 12:27.555
Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go.

12:28.335 --> 12:31.040
Uh, Em, I don't think that
plant is getting any shinier.

12:31.046 --> 12:34.322
Do you know I was thinking,
maybe I can't do this.

12:34.323 --> 12:35.549
What?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.440
No, actually I'm fine.

12:37.446 --> 12:40.055
- Em, what... what's up?
- Nothing. I'm fine. I just, um...

12:40.061 --> 12:44.837
I'm just feeling a lot today.
But I'm fine. So let's do this!

12:44.843 --> 12:47.690
Yeah. Uh, it's just that
you're saying you're fine a lot.

12:47.696 --> 12:49.524
- Because I'm fine.
- Em, what's happened?

12:49.530 --> 12:53.030
Nothing, I'm totally fine. I mean,
Josh texted me, but it's totally fine.

12:53.036 --> 12:54.649
Okay. But he-he's been
trying to contact you

12:54.654 --> 12:56.006
- for ages, hasn't he?
- Yes, but he calls...

12:56.011 --> 12:59.131
he calls and I hang up. But this is the
first message that he's gotten through.

13:00.505 --> 13:02.310
"Please answer my calls."
What does that mean?

13:02.311 --> 13:04.244
Uh, answer his, um... You know what?

13:04.250 --> 13:06.605
- Maybe now's not the time...
- I just don't want to talk to him.

13:06.610 --> 13:09.228
I don't want to be insensitive, but
can we go back to when you were fine?

13:09.233 --> 13:11.126
There might be a cry, or
a yell. I'm not sure yet.

13:11.131 --> 13:12.593
No, no, no, Emma, I need happy Emma

13:12.599 --> 13:14.661
to help me talk to strangers
and keep me calm today.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.201
We can... we can both
have breakdowns tomorrow.

13:16.206 --> 13:17.420
I was thinking maybe I
should go back to uni.

13:17.425 --> 13:19.624
- No.
- I mean, all my ideas are dumb, Dan.

13:19.630 --> 13:22.473
All we got yesterday were
40 sausages that you paid for

13:22.479 --> 13:24.419
- and a bag of rubbish from the Op Shop.
- They were just a bit mothy.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.625
There was a dead fish
in one of the hats.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.940
Okay. Well, you made chocolate
crackles and they're excellent.

13:27.945 --> 13:30.535
I did. I just... I-I'm holding you back.

13:30.541 --> 13:31.955
No-no, you're not. See, in fact...

13:31.961 --> 13:36.780
I-I read that a man and woman team sell
more properties. So you know, just...

13:38.017 --> 13:40.417
- Be a woman?
- Yes.

13:40.859 --> 13:42.585
Y-you can do this.

13:45.070 --> 13:46.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:46.336 --> 13:48.887
- Am-am I in the right place?
- Oh, I hope so.

13:48.893 --> 13:52.484
If you're not, neither are we. Come
in. Um... here's an information sheet.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.905
I'd probably start with the master
bedroom. It's just down the hall.

13:54.910 --> 13:57.020
And by the time you get back
I'll have a pot of tea ready.

13:57.025 --> 13:59.384
- Oh, thank you.
- No worries. I'm Emma, and this

13:59.390 --> 14:00.924
- is Daniel, if you have any questions.
- Hi.

14:00.929 --> 14:02.276
- Hi.
- Oh, and please help yourself to

14:02.281 --> 14:03.600
a chocolate crackle?

14:05.518 --> 14:06.893
Thanks.

14:07.503 --> 14:08.703
***

14:10.081 --> 14:12.018
- Em, that was... that was brilliant.
- Oh.

14:12.495 --> 14:14.791
- Was it?
- Yeah, that... that was perfect.

14:14.797 --> 14:16.120
Really? It felt fake.

14:16.126 --> 14:19.690
Well, to me, it felt like someone
honestly expressing themselves.

14:19.807 --> 14:21.318
- Bruce Lee?
- Yep.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.113
Smart. I hope to meet him some day.

14:23.119 --> 14:24.444
- Well, he's dead.
- Oh...

14:24.450 --> 14:27.010
- then we've lost a great netballer.
- I know you know who he is.

14:36.786 --> 14:40.622
Ah, the backyard. Great
for... entertaining.

14:41.303 --> 14:43.608
Does the master bedroom get morning sun?

14:43.614 --> 14:46.261
Uh, yeah, probably.

14:46.267 --> 14:49.264
I put this, uh, pond
in a few years back.

14:49.270 --> 14:51.864
I mean, happy for you to
keep the fish for a small fee.

14:51.870 --> 14:53.087
Where's the water feature?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.706
Uh, it was stolen by robbers
who said they'd never come back.

14:55.712 --> 14:57.899
- John, can I borrow you for one second?
- Ah, yeah.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.292
Told you more people would come.

15:00.298 --> 15:02.801
Yeah, I thought we agreed
it's best if you're not here.

15:02.807 --> 15:04.541
Yeah, but then I thought it would be.

15:06.982 --> 15:08.884
- Oh!
- Are you okay? What's happened? Huh?

15:08.890 --> 15:10.478
Someone threw a spider over the fence.

15:10.484 --> 15:13.082
- Oh, where?
- Oh, give it a rest, Susan!

15:13.088 --> 15:14.547
You started it!

15:14.553 --> 15:16.847
I can't help where they
go once I release 'em!

15:16.853 --> 15:18.717
You release them over my fence!

15:18.723 --> 15:20.547
- Argh!
- Sorry, Susan!

15:20.553 --> 15:22.301
Well, it won't... won't happen again!

15:22.307 --> 15:23.649
John, what's going on?

15:23.655 --> 15:26.726
Oh, look, she's caught me throwing
one over her fence once or twice.

15:26.732 --> 15:29.330
Now she's convinced every spider
in her house comes from me.

15:29.331 --> 15:31.236
- Great.
- Hey, mate!

15:31.828 --> 15:33.961
- It's all freshly laid, all this.
- So sorry.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.314
Well, it's mostly fresh.

15:35.315 --> 15:37.141
Did you concrete over the marble?

15:37.818 --> 15:40.624
Yeah. Hey, come and have a
look at the water feature.

15:54.311 --> 15:55.516
- What?
- Hi,

15:55.522 --> 15:59.053
I'm Emma from McCallum Real Estate.
I am one half of the man-woman team

15:59.059 --> 16:00.436
running the open home next door.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.366
- I'm the woman half.
- What do you want?

16:02.831 --> 16:05.640
I'm glad you asked. I've just
been informed that there's been a

16:05.646 --> 16:08.456
bit of a spiders-over-the-fence
thing happening.

16:08.462 --> 16:10.872
- Personally, I'm cool with it...
- He started it.

16:10.878 --> 16:12.598
Had one land in my drink once.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.250
He thinks it's humane.

16:14.256 --> 16:17.503
Do you think it's humane to fly
through the air and drown in a Mai Tai?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.359
It's how I'd wanna go.

16:21.115 --> 16:23.617
Anyway, I was just wondering if
you could not do that anymore.

16:24.115 --> 16:26.342
He's been doing it for years.

16:26.343 --> 16:30.155
Just for today? And he won't do
it either. Truce. All spiders down.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.960
Look, it's going to be a lot
easier for us to sell his place

16:33.965 --> 16:35.687
if we're not getting nightmare rain.

16:36.177 --> 16:37.966
- Fine.
- Sweet.

16:37.972 --> 16:39.444
Chocolate crackle?

16:43.363 --> 16:45.052
Who says no to you?

16:53.687 --> 16:55.517
What about the mountain?

16:55.523 --> 16:57.933
Uh... erosion?

16:59.014 --> 17:00.203
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, but,

17:00.209 --> 17:01.975
you're not... not... not...
listening to what I'm saying.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.271
It's completely different!

17:03.277 --> 17:05.233
Yeah, but you're not seeing
the potential of the place.

17:05.238 --> 17:07.263
Well, I'm seeing a bunch
of power lines outside.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.914
- Hi, I'm, ah, I'm Daniel. Yes.
- Mate, are you... are you the agent?

17:09.919 --> 17:11.977
Oh, wh-where do you get off
advertising a place like this?

17:11.982 --> 17:13.203
- Well...
- Chocolate crackle, anyone?

17:13.208 --> 17:15.699
I've already spotted 15
things wrong with this.

17:16.007 --> 17:18.483
- Did I miss one?
- Look, if you don't like it, just go.

17:18.489 --> 17:21.251
You've wasted our whole day to
come and see this piece of shit.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.751
Hey, this house has been in
my family for two generations.

17:23.757 --> 17:25.542
- 'Cause no one would buy it!
- Yeah, John, let's... let's...

17:25.548 --> 17:28.517
My father built it with his
own blood, sweat and tears.

17:28.522 --> 17:30.961
Well, maybe if he'd used
bricks it'd be in better nick!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.652
- John, let's... Um...
- No, no, no. You know what?

17:32.657 --> 17:34.940
- You don't deserve it. Get out.
- Excuse me?

17:34.946 --> 17:37.859
- No, you heard me. Get out. Go on! Nup.
- John, not a good sales tactic.

17:40.311 --> 17:42.033
It's a fixer-upper!

17:44.822 --> 17:46.182
What are you looking at?

17:48.582 --> 17:50.495
He doesn't come with the house.

17:52.877 --> 17:54.096
I knew he'd mess this up.

17:54.102 --> 17:57.359
Yeah, but you thought heaps of
other things would mess this up too.

17:57.365 --> 17:58.807
Excuse me?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.318
Hi.

18:01.557 --> 18:03.276
Uh, thanks for coming.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.582
Yes, I'm Carol, and this is Martin.

18:05.588 --> 18:07.985
- Hi. I'm Martin.
- I just said that.

18:07.991 --> 18:11.002
Um, Cathy told us there might
be a sausage sizzle on today?

18:11.009 --> 18:13.979
Yes. Um, I did cook some sausages
last night. Ah, they're in the fridge.

18:13.985 --> 18:15.466
I could put them in the
microwave if you want one.

18:15.471 --> 18:17.518
Oh, it's fine. We were coming anyway.

18:17.524 --> 18:19.492
Now, these photos...

18:19.498 --> 18:22.420
- Yes. Uh, sorry about that too.
- A bunch of great ideas here.

18:23.985 --> 18:28.404
Uh... yeah. Yeah. No, we,
um... we thought so too.

18:46.163 --> 18:49.577
Oh, John. Good news.

18:50.365 --> 18:51.565
They're right, you know.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.300
It is a piece of shit.

18:53.306 --> 18:56.318
What? Yeah? That's not true. It's...

18:56.581 --> 18:58.159
Well, that's what they all said today.

18:58.165 --> 19:01.988
No, no, John, your... your
house is a r-renovator's dream.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.388
- Is it?
- Yeah, it's got, um... charm.

19:06.394 --> 19:07.886
- Good windows.
- Great windows.

19:07.892 --> 19:10.286
- Beautiful pond.
- Beautiful pond.

19:10.292 --> 19:12.318
It's a... it's a fixer-upper, right?

19:12.319 --> 19:13.878
Everyone hated it.

19:14.315 --> 19:15.823
They said my carpet was ugly.

19:15.829 --> 19:17.510
Th-Th-the paintwork was all shoddy...

19:17.516 --> 19:19.894
No, no, John, I've got a couple
in there right now who love it.

19:19.899 --> 19:21.490
We-we might have an offer.

19:23.315 --> 19:25.310
They didn't miss the solar panels?

19:25.311 --> 19:26.924
Nope, thought it was a great suggestion.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.819
- And we saved you a chocolate crackle.
- Yes.

19:41.303 --> 19:43.533
Now, can we please go
inside and sell this house?

19:43.539 --> 19:46.400
Argh! Oh, Jesus! Oh! Yes!

19:47.319 --> 19:50.011
Cop that, John, you bastard!

19:53.957 --> 19:55.748
What's your favourite medication?

19:55.754 --> 19:58.246
Um, Triaderm.

19:58.252 --> 20:00.151
Of course. Sounds like a dinosaur.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.826
No, I think I'm just saying that
because I prescribed it this morning,

20:02.831 --> 20:05.233
- and nobody's ever asked me that.
- Ah.

20:05.628 --> 20:08.340
- Must be weird seeing Dan again.
- No, it's nice.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.474
You do know you're like
the worst-case scenario?

20:10.480 --> 20:12.849
A bit, like an ex that
you never really got over

20:12.855 --> 20:15.862
who's now a doctor and
who's lost 30 kilos.

20:17.362 --> 20:19.559
- Dan's changed a lot, too.
- How?

20:19.565 --> 20:20.912
He used to have an overbite.

20:22.881 --> 20:24.168
Here he comes.

20:24.379 --> 20:25.705
Hello!

20:26.886 --> 20:28.278
Grace?

20:28.582 --> 20:29.782
What happened?

20:29.788 --> 20:32.334
A spider fell on your
face and you fainted.

20:33.082 --> 20:35.685
- Because I was brave?
- No.

20:35.691 --> 20:38.592
Susan didn't go for the chocolate
crackles because she's a monster.

20:38.598 --> 20:40.553
- Oh, where's John?
- It's fine. He's inside.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.004
Here we go. Come on.

20:44.937 --> 20:46.143
How long was I out for?

20:46.149 --> 20:47.931
30 years. We've got a
lot to fill you in on.

20:47.937 --> 20:49.837
Maybe 20 minutes.

20:49.843 --> 20:52.234
I'm gonna head inside.
Come in when you're ready.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.441
Oh, did Em draw anything
on my face while I was out?

20:54.447 --> 20:56.825
No, your hand. But she
felt bad and stopped.

20:58.158 --> 21:00.746
Um, Grace, I've got to...

21:00.752 --> 21:02.375
- run back in, but, um...
- Yeah.

21:02.376 --> 21:04.283
thanks for... thanks for being here.

21:04.289 --> 21:06.284
No problem. Feel better.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.701
Oh, I faint all the time. Just,
um, recharging the batteries.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.818
Yep, yeah, step there.

21:12.192 --> 21:13.411
Oh...

21:13.989 --> 21:16.958
Oh, John. I am so sorry.

21:16.964 --> 21:20.118
Ah, don't worry. Susan's got me
a few times with a spider too.

21:20.124 --> 21:21.328
Did you faint?

21:21.334 --> 21:22.766
- No.
- You did.

21:23.852 --> 21:25.750
Carol and Martin. Did... did they leave?

21:25.756 --> 21:27.549
They did. They're still interested.

21:27.555 --> 21:28.844
- Great.
- Yeah.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.053
Yeah, I-I've had a think
about what you said.

21:31.059 --> 21:32.284
Oh, okay.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.264
Yeah, I think maybe I was
being a little bit hasty

21:34.270 --> 21:35.866
about, ah, getting rid of the place.

21:36.257 --> 21:37.905
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, I...

21:37.911 --> 21:41.025
No, it-it's like what you both
said. I mean, it's got charm.

21:41.031 --> 21:42.724
You know, it's on a great block of land.

21:42.730 --> 21:43.952
- We didn't say that.
- Ah, you know,

21:43.957 --> 21:45.536
got a beautiful view of the countryside.

21:45.541 --> 21:46.822
- Or that.
- Yeah.

21:46.828 --> 21:48.626
I think I might stick
around a bit longer.

21:48.856 --> 21:50.457
I don't want to sell anymore.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.748
John, we only said that
stuff to make you feel better.

21:53.754 --> 21:56.533
I mean, you're lucky someone actually
wants to buy this piece of shit.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.628
Get out.

22:13.311 --> 22:14.511
Hey, champ.

22:16.489 --> 22:18.314
Look, you did your best.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.402
He didn't want to sell. What can you do?

22:20.408 --> 22:22.527
Not faint. Not talk him out of selling.

22:22.533 --> 22:23.807
No.

22:24.017 --> 22:26.900
Everyone faints for no reason

22:26.906 --> 22:29.898
and does the opposite of
what their job is sometimes.

22:31.662 --> 22:33.046
Have you called your mum?

22:33.467 --> 22:34.691
No.

22:35.459 --> 22:37.672
I can't call her. I'll text it.

22:37.678 --> 22:41.413
I can pick out some tasteful emojis that
might help soften the blow, if you like.

22:41.418 --> 22:44.630
- I find the praying one is good...
- Oh, shit!

22:44.636 --> 22:47.136
- Oh, Em, I sent your text!
- What? My text? No, you didn't.

22:47.142 --> 22:49.165
- I sent your message.
- You didn't. You didn't!

22:49.171 --> 22:51.312
- Yes! Why didn't you delete the draft?!
- Did you? What'd you do that for?

22:51.317 --> 22:54.192
- You told me to hold my thumbs up!
- What... At least get rid of...

22:54.198 --> 22:56.894
- Can I just get it back?
- No, of course you can't get it back!

22:56.900 --> 22:58.527
It's fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.392
- She's calling. Shit. Shit.
- Well, maybe...

23:00.398 --> 23:03.130
maybe she'll be happy that he
doesn't want to sell because...

23:03.406 --> 23:05.248
mo' money, mo' problems.

23:09.858 --> 23:11.946
- Hello?
- You sold it?

23:11.952 --> 23:15.469
Under-age pregnancy is no laughing
matter, Daniel, but you did it.

23:15.475 --> 23:17.054
There was some interest.

23:17.326 --> 23:19.307
John decided to stay on a little longer.

23:19.313 --> 23:21.631
what? what are you talking about?

23:22.303 --> 23:25.686
It was his decision. He... he
doesn't want to sell anymore.

23:26.299 --> 23:28.640
Then why the hell did
you send me that text?

23:28.646 --> 23:31.041
It was a draft. Um...

23:31.138 --> 23:33.261
I thought... I thought I
was going to sell the house.

23:33.943 --> 23:36.349
Mum, I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry.

23:38.843 --> 23:41.358
Mo' money, mo' problems?

23:42.584 --> 23:44.871
I'll see you in two days.

23:47.098 --> 23:48.530
Love you.

23:54.028 --> 23:55.651
What can we do?

23:56.833 --> 23:58.051
Go back to Melbourne?

23:58.057 --> 24:01.239
I can't go back. I can't
afford to go anywhere else.

24:01.245 --> 24:03.272
Too old to backpack and
I'm too scared to squat.

24:03.278 --> 24:04.927
Em, you were the one who was wronged.

24:05.427 --> 24:06.768
I replied to Josh.

24:06.774 --> 24:08.069
What'd you send?

24:09.755 --> 24:11.187
"This is the police.

24:11.193 --> 24:13.403
"The woman whose phone
this is is dead in a ditch.

24:13.409 --> 24:16.411
"She died of a broken heart and
also she was pregnant. Fuck you."

24:16.417 --> 24:17.617
Jesus.

24:17.963 --> 24:19.598
- I was really upset.
- Yeah.

24:19.604 --> 24:20.860
- It's bad, isn't it?
- Well...

24:20.866 --> 24:23.376
- I mean, he's the one... Yeah!
- Yeah, he left you on your honeymoon.

24:23.381 --> 24:26.250
It's full on but, yeah,
he... he deserved it.

24:28.992 --> 24:31.534
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna go for a walk.

24:31.540 --> 24:33.767
- Oh, okay, I'll get a jumper.
- No, if that's okay. I...

24:33.772 --> 24:35.314
- want to go by myself.
- Why?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.914
I'm just... Clear my head.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.787
- Oh. Give me your shoelaces.
- What?

24:38.793 --> 24:41.169
Just give me your shoelaces so
I know you won't hurt yourself.

24:41.174 --> 24:43.987
I'm not gonna hurt myself. I don't know
how I'd hurt myself with my shoelaces.

24:43.992 --> 24:45.380
Okay, then why do you want to be alone?

24:45.385 --> 24:47.554
- Because I'm upset. No, no, no! No!
- Just give them to me. Just give them

24:47.559 --> 24:49.085
to me then you can go on
your stupid walk, by yourself.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.498
- Em, no! Do what? No. No.
- I'm not gonna let you do this.

24:51.504 --> 24:53.404
- Fine. Fine. Come. Come for the walk.
- Give me this one.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.609
Come for the walk.

24:57.605 --> 24:59.567
- Oh, your tag's sticking out.
- No, no, don't. Don't.

24:59.572 --> 25:00.809
- It's sticking out. It looks dumb.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

25:00.814 --> 25:02.814
- It looks bad. I'm helping.
- Here we go. Stop it!

25:09.343 --> 25:10.608
Someone else has been in here.

25:10.614 --> 25:12.239
- It's Bruce.
- Are you mad?

25:12.245 --> 25:13.813
This is where I came
to get away from him.

25:13.818 --> 25:15.586
I don't want to regret never
standing up to him my whole life.

25:15.591 --> 25:16.843
- Let's do this!
- Woo!

25:16.849 --> 25:18.160
I don't want to do this.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.958
He replaced my sunscreen
with liquid paper once.

25:19.963 --> 25:21.367
Do you want to stand up to Bruce or not?

25:21.368 --> 25:23.943
- "Fuck you."
- No, no.

25:23.949 --> 25:25.459
No, it doesn't... no, no...

25:25.465 --> 25:27.875
- Bruce is a piece of shit.
- What?

25:35.468 --> 25:36.897
The chimney!

25:37.763 --> 25:38.963
15.
