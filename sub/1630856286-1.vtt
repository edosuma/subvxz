00:18.333 --> 00:19.625
<i>Welcome to Xandar.</i>

00:20.666 --> 00:23.416
<i>A place where everyone's luck
eventually runs out.</i>

00:25.375 --> 00:26.708
<i>Even Yondu's.</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:38.416
<i>Someone did this to him.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:45.250
<i>But the question is, who?</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:55.416
Corpsman Nebula,
you can step away from the body.

00:55.791 --> 00:57.166
The real cops are here.

00:57.916 --> 01:00.541
Looks like a career criminal
got what was coming to him.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.375
Works for me.

01:03.958 --> 01:07.291
All right, boys, I want this scene
scrubbed and wrapped up in the hour.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.708
Already cracked the case, huh?

01:10.875 --> 01:14.708
I don't need Black Order trash
telling me how to do my job.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.416
Former Black Order.

01:17.166 --> 01:20.208
I earned my stars here, same as you.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.416
Is there a problem, Corpsman?

01:23.416 --> 01:24.666
This is Xandar.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.916
All we got are problems.

01:27.750 --> 01:28.750
I see.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.208
Move it. I said within the hour.

01:43.041 --> 01:44.041
<i>Time.</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:48.666
<i>Space.</i>

01:50.250 --> 01:51.250
<i>Reality.</i>

01:54.208 --> 01:56.041
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

02:00.791 --> 02:05.416
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

02:07.708 --> 02:11.541
<i>where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

02:13.875 --> 02:17.000
<i>creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.</i>

02:20.875 --> 02:22.125
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

02:24.458 --> 02:27.708
<i>I am your guide
through these vast new realities.</i>

02:29.125 --> 02:32.916
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

02:36.250 --> 02:37.833
<i>"What if?"</i>

02:44.375 --> 02:47.500
<i>All quests for redemption
begin in darkness.</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:50.708
<i>And Nebula's was no different.</i>

02:52.333 --> 02:56.416
<i>In this universe,
Ronan the Accuser betrayed Thanos.</i>

02:57.416 --> 03:00.791
<i>The Mad Titan's thirst for power
had met its match.</i>

03:00.791 --> 03:04.000
<i>And in his fall, he took
Nebula's sister along with him.</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:05.416
<i>...sister along with him.</i>

03:06.375 --> 03:09.875
<i>I was lost,
adrift in the ruins of my past.</i>

03:12.333 --> 03:16.083
<i>Until someone saw the light in me.</i>

03:22.583 --> 03:26.958
<i>With compassion and kindness,
Nova Prime gave me a way forward.</i>

03:26.958 --> 03:28.375
Take my hand.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.000
<i>I swore the Nova Corps oath.</i>

03:36.000 --> 03:38.291
Seek the light, be the light.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.958
Never stray from its path.

03:40.500 --> 03:44.375
<i>Little did I know,
our darkest days still lay ahead,</i>

03:45.291 --> 03:50.250
<i>when the man who destroyed my first home
came gunning for my new one.</i>

03:50.250 --> 03:51.375
- Go! Move it!
- Run! Run!

03:51.375 --> 03:52.958
<i>Ronan and his forces attacked,</i>

03:52.958 --> 03:56.000
<i>bringing Xandar
to the verge of destruction.</i>

03:56.333 --> 03:59.375
<i>Out of options,
Nova Prime made a desperate call.</i>

03:59.375 --> 04:01.041
Fire up the shield generator.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.000
<i>She locked down Xandar
behind an impenetrable planetary shield</i>

04:07.458 --> 04:09.500
<i>designed to last for 50 years,</i>

04:10.708 --> 04:13.416
<i>putting the planet out of his reach.</i>

04:16.125 --> 04:18.125
<i>Xandar was saved for the time being.</i>

04:19.333 --> 04:20.375
<i>But at what cost?</i>

04:26.750 --> 04:30.708
<i>Five years in, isolation has brought out
the worst in all of us.</i>

04:31.250 --> 04:35.500
<i>Still, hope or no hope, I took an oath.</i>

04:43.500 --> 04:45.541
<i>Garthan Saal and his lackeys</i>

04:45.541 --> 04:48.500
<i>wasted their time
hunting for the killer's weapon,</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:53.833
<i>when they really should have been looking</i>

04:55.083 --> 04:56.291
<i>for the victim's.</i>

04:58.958 --> 05:02.958
<i>Yondu and I had a past
and some memories to go with it.</i>

05:03.833 --> 05:05.500
<i>Memories I could use.</i>

05:06.916 --> 05:10.291
<i>You and I, Nebby, we make quite the team.</i>

05:12.375 --> 05:14.541
<i>You and I, Nebby, we make quite the team.</i>

05:17.791 --> 05:20.458
<i>You and I, Nebby, we make quite the team.</i>

05:23.041 --> 05:24.875
<i>You and I, Nebby, we make quite the team.</i>

05:25.958 --> 05:28.625
<i>You and I, Nebby, we make...</i>

05:34.166 --> 05:35.208
What?

05:41.416 --> 05:45.041
<i>Oh, Yondu. What did you get into?</i>

05:49.166 --> 05:50.958
<i>So, no results?</i>

05:50.958 --> 05:52.125
<i>Sorry, Officer.</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:55.458
<i>There are no records of these schematics
in any archive on Xandar.</i>

05:55.458 --> 05:57.333
Not even on the shadow network?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.666
<i>Negative. Thank you for your enquiry.</i>

05:59.666 --> 06:00.916
Pleasure's all mine.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.708
<i>Riot in progress.</i>

06:02.708 --> 06:05.166
<i>Send two more units
to the Xandarian mall, stat.</i>

06:05.166 --> 06:07.125
<i>No can do.
Dealing with power failure</i>

06:07.125 --> 06:08.750
<i>on the south side.</i>

06:09.833 --> 06:13.166
<i>Corpsman Nebula, I heard
you were at Yondu's crime scene.</i>

06:13.416 --> 06:15.000
<i>I know you two had a past.</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:16.166
We did.

06:16.166 --> 06:20.000
He had a checkered rep
but he was never a bad egg.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.583
<i>And neither were you.</i>

06:22.125 --> 06:25.458
You took a chance on me.
I'll never forget it.

06:26.166 --> 06:29.583
<i>I trusted you then
and I'm trusting you now.</i>

06:29.583 --> 06:30.708
Ma'am?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.416
<i>Switch to a secure line.</i>

06:35.583 --> 06:36.750
Done.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.958
<i>Xandar's on the brink.</i>

06:38.958 --> 06:42.208
<i>Yondu got himself caught up
with some dark forces on the rise,</i>

06:42.208 --> 06:45.958
<i>and if I'm right,
Xandar only has until dawn.</i>

06:48.125 --> 06:50.250
I did find something at the crime scene.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.916
I'm not sure what it is, but it seems
Yondu gave his life to protect it.

06:54.916 --> 06:58.291
<i>Those instincts are why
I gave you the stars, Nebula.</i>

06:58.291 --> 06:59.583
<i>Follow them.</i>

06:59.583 --> 07:01.916
<i>And use any means necessary.</i>

07:02.541 --> 07:04.916
<i>Or I fear Xandar
won't see another sunrise.</i>

07:05.666 --> 07:07.416
<i>Do you understand my orders, Corpsman?</i>

07:09.458 --> 07:10.750
I won't let you down.

07:28.791 --> 07:29.875
You have a warrant?

07:39.916 --> 07:41.083
Yeah!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.833
I am Groot.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.791
No!

08:00.750 --> 08:02.416
Hey. Is the big man in?

08:02.416 --> 08:04.000
High rollers' table, sis.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.166
But fair warning,

08:05.166 --> 08:08.125
he does not like to be bothered
when he's on a hot streak.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.583
Hey, Howard.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.833
- You.
- How's business?

08:20.833 --> 08:23.458
The world's falling apart
and I'm running a casino.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.208
Things are great.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.833
And speaking of great... Waitress,

08:26.833 --> 08:30.208
could you bring us some small bites
for the reflective woman over here?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.791
Or do you just eat megabytes?

08:33.041 --> 08:36.125
Aw, jeez. Are you ever
off the clock?

08:37.541 --> 08:39.750
All right, folks.
Big Daddy needs the room.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.125
But, Howie, the hot streak.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.291
- Mindy, come on.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.458
Yeah, you come back later.

08:46.541 --> 08:49.083
So, if you have this arrow,

08:49.083 --> 08:52.875
I'm guessing Yondu's finally turned
a paler shade of blue.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.875
He gave his life to protect this.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.791
Now that is some serious glitz.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.041
I ran these schematics

09:02.041 --> 09:04.333
through every archive on Xandar.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.083
- Nothing could ID them.
- Oh!

09:06.083 --> 09:07.750
You have a hand in every pot, Howard.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.125
- Top shelf!
- What do you know?

09:09.125 --> 09:13.166
Talk about secrets from the...
Nebby, this is some pretty great business.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.000
- What is it?
- What is it?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.958
- That's what I asked.
- You're the detective.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.541
- That's why I'm asking you a question.
- How should I know?

09:20.541 --> 09:21.625
Look at this thing.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.958
What kind of absolute freak
would know what this is?

09:23.958 --> 09:26.500
Oh, that's an old
city-wide mainframe core.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.000
It's a unit B-42, I believe.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.041
I didn't think
there were many of those left.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.625
- How would you know that?
- I know all sorts of things.

09:32.625 --> 09:36.291
- I'm more than just a pretty face.
- I repeat, what the hell?

09:36.291 --> 09:38.083
Data core. What's in it?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.541
Quite the hodgepodge, actually.

09:39.541 --> 09:42.583
Sanitation department,
metadata, unpaid parking tickets,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.291
rush hour statistics,
source code for the shield generator,

09:45.291 --> 09:46.625
even an actual kitchen sink.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.625
- Go back one.
- Unpaid parking tickets?

09:48.625 --> 09:50.083
- No.
- Rush hour statistics?

09:50.083 --> 09:53.666
- The other back one.
- Source code for the shield generator?

09:53.666 --> 09:54.750
Bingo.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.916
Looks like someone might be trying
to take down the planetary shield.

09:57.916 --> 09:59.875
But why would anyone wanna do that?

10:00.625 --> 10:02.583
Someone's making way for an invasion.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.166
I need to get into that mainframe
and destroy those codes

10:05.166 --> 10:08.166
- before they get out.
- Whoa, Nebby, you sure about all this?

10:08.166 --> 10:13.000
Places like that,
not everyone who goes in comes out.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.833
Which means that many of the people
who enter these premises

10:15.833 --> 10:18.208
end up dead, forever.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.375
Forever dead.

10:21.291 --> 10:24.208
I'm on this case,
no matter where it takes me.

10:27.875 --> 10:31.625
<i>If I wanted to get inside that mainframe,</i>

10:31.625 --> 10:35.250
<i>I'd need someone with a rep
for breaching high-end security.</i>

10:35.250 --> 10:38.500
<i>Someone who'd infiltrated
Xandarian systems before.</i>

10:42.416 --> 10:43.666
Inmate request?

10:43.666 --> 10:45.458
X2357.

10:45.833 --> 10:48.458
Do you understand
that entering a correctional facility

10:48.458 --> 10:50.000
can be hazardous to your health?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.083
- I do.
- Hey!

10:51.083 --> 10:52.958
Do you waive all rights and liability

10:52.958 --> 10:55.000
and understand
that anything that happens here

10:55.000 --> 10:57.250
- is your own responsibility?
- Uh-huh.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.375
I waive all the rights.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.083
YON-ROGG: Corpsman Nebula.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.958
Yon-Rogg.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.708
Still rocking the same look, I see.

11:11.708 --> 11:12.875
Oh.

11:15.666 --> 11:18.208
Oh, you know me. No muss, no fuss.

11:18.208 --> 11:21.791
No muss, no fuss indeed.
It's been a while.

11:21.791 --> 11:22.875
I'm tight on time

11:22.875 --> 11:26.375
and I need someone who knows their way
around Xandarian security.

11:26.375 --> 11:30.166
- Aw, and you thought of me.
- I arrested you for it, didn't I?

11:30.166 --> 11:31.791
But if you'd rather stay here,

11:31.791 --> 11:34.583
I'm open to other recommendations.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.625
Lead the way.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.250
<i>Full facility alert.</i>

11:42.250 --> 11:44.708
<i>Containment breach in cell block D.</i>

11:44.708 --> 11:47.000
<i>- Repeat, containment breach.
- </i>

11:52.125 --> 11:53.458
So, this was your plan?

11:53.458 --> 11:54.625
Give me some credit.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.708
Don't bother.
I already disabled the ejection seats.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.583
So, where are we heading?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.750
Somewhere we're not invited.

12:26.750 --> 12:30.541
- Wow. And I thought you took an oath.
- And this is what it takes to keep it.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.250
Is that right? Can't say it looks
like that from where I'm sitting.

12:34.541 --> 12:36.333
Oh, I don't need you to understand.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.625
I just need you to live up
to your reputation.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.375
That's our way in.

12:46.708 --> 12:49.208
You do realize
I don't have any tools with me.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.375
You know, I'm starting to think

12:52.375 --> 12:54.958
you and I would have been
quite the team back in the day.

12:54.958 --> 12:56.166
Hardly.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.916
YON-ROGG: Whoo! 2,200 stories, huh?

12:59.583 --> 13:01.541
That's a long way down.

13:01.541 --> 13:04.375
I didn't break you out of jail
to point out the obvious.

13:04.375 --> 13:08.166
Yeah, I'm just saying,
it doesn't need to take all night.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.333
Why did you stop?

13:14.333 --> 13:16.333
YON-ROGG: Live wire.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.500
Little early in the night
to fry your circuits, don't you think?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.333
The data core's in there.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.125
Come on, baby. Talk to me.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.791
- Do you know how dumb that sounds?
- Shh.

13:36.791 --> 13:40.041
There's nothing to listen for.
There are no gears in it.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.708
No, I know. I was just shushing you.

13:41.708 --> 13:44.125
<i>Core overheating.</i>

13:44.125 --> 13:46.250
Oh, was that your clever plan?

13:46.250 --> 13:47.875
Give me some credit.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.625
Well, I hope you like working underwater.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.708
A Xandarian mainframe core.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.458
Impressive.

14:32.916 --> 14:38.833
No access ports, no disk drives,
no control panels.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.458
You've done your part. Let me do mine.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.500
And don't touch anything.

14:46.083 --> 14:49.208
<i>Omega-class

14:49.208 --> 14:51.166

15:15.500 --> 15:17.166
Delete source files.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.458
<i>Source files deleted.</i>

15:19.458 --> 15:22.541
<i>Logging-out sequence initiated.</i>

15:22.541 --> 15:24.083
YON-ROGG: Actually, I think I can put

15:24.083 --> 15:27.208
that source code to better use.

15:27.208 --> 15:30.416
I have to say,
I didn't think this would be so easy.

15:30.416 --> 15:32.500
You've gone soft.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.666
<i>Log-out sequence stalled.</i>

15:34.666 --> 15:36.625
<i>System compromised.</i>

15:36.625 --> 15:38.625
<i>System overheating.</i>

15:38.625 --> 15:40.333
<i>System critical.</i>

15:40.875 --> 15:44.041
Oh, by the way, you don't have to worry
about Xandar anymore.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.708
Ronan has big plans for it.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.666
You. It's you.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.583
I knew that blast
wouldn't kill her.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.000
She always has been a survivor.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.125
Yes. We'll fix that.

17:01.791 --> 17:03.250
This was all a setup.

17:03.833 --> 17:08.458
Giving me the Yondu case,
pointing me to the shield codes.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.875
All so you could start an invasion.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.750
You swore an oath to defend Xandar.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.208
And look where it got us.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.875
The world's falling apart.

17:19.875 --> 17:23.750
People are at each other's throats.
We can't go on like this.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.916
And sometimes,
there's just no shame in surrender.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.583
No shame? And what else?

17:31.166 --> 17:35.875
Well, of course, Ronan promised to keep me
in charge in exchange for my cooperation.

17:36.666 --> 17:40.333
There was no way to access
the data core without a cyborg.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.750
Then I remembered I recruited one.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.583
You've been using me this whole time.

17:46.083 --> 17:49.000
You're a machine. What did you expect?

17:51.291 --> 17:54.375
Finish her, and make sure
you melt down the pieces when you're done.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.458
Yes, ma'am.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.625
All right, time to finish this.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.250
Nothing can survive that.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.541
What do you say, boss?

18:48.083 --> 18:49.625
I'm calling it, boys.

18:52.208 --> 18:56.208
Corpsman Nebula, end of watch.

19:08.166 --> 19:10.166
Down with Nova Corps.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.916
Free Xandar.

19:12.666 --> 19:16.083
- Down with Nova Corps.
- You've lost your way, Nova scum.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.833
There! Take that!

19:17.833 --> 19:20.000
- Hey! Watch it!
- What's the matter with you?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.208
- You got something to say?
- Down with Nova Corps. Free Xandar.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.083
- Hey! Watch it!
- Down with Nova Corps...

19:26.041 --> 19:27.708
- Rock, paper.
- Groot, Groot.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.791
But it's uncuttable paper
'cause it's made of rock.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.166
Look.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.916
Yeah, what's all the ruckus?

19:34.916 --> 19:36.833
Oh, Nebula. Nebby, are you okay?

19:37.791 --> 19:39.750
Golly gosh, I barely recognized her.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.250
I'd say I told you so,

19:41.250 --> 19:43.583
but your head's bashed in,
so you wouldn't remember.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.000
I'm fine.
I just need a drink.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.833
And guns. And an arm.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.250
What's it take for a girl
to get a little service around here?

19:53.250 --> 19:56.000
Jeez. I can hear your processors
clicking and whirring.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.958
Yeah, the pile of rocks has a point,
Nebby. You're a wreck.

19:58.958 --> 20:03.041
- We can't even pawn you for parts.
- I said I'm fine.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.708
Oh, no. This is bad.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.708
Those aren't supposed to pay out.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.916
Ah, there she is.
Welcome back to the land of the living.

20:41.166 --> 20:43.166
There was a second there
where I was thinking,

20:43.166 --> 20:45.791
-"What am I gonna sing at her funeral?"
- I'm fine.

20:45.791 --> 20:47.791
Now, about those guns...

20:47.791 --> 20:51.416
Guns? Nebula, even if I had,
say, heavy weaponry,

20:51.416 --> 20:57.166
you know, military grade, sure to kill,
which I'm not saying I do,

20:57.166 --> 20:59.125
breaking them out
would be bad for business.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.708
Nova Prime's helping Ronan
launch an invasion.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.541
How's that gonna help business?

21:03.541 --> 21:06.958
- Business takes care of itself.
- The people of Xandar are going to suffer.

21:06.958 --> 21:09.750
- They'll drink more.
- Nova Prime will take your liquor license.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.125
No!

21:11.125 --> 21:13.083
Rock, paper, scissors, strap up.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.250
It's happy hour.

21:18.958 --> 21:19.958
I am Groot.

21:27.291 --> 21:28.708
Right. So we all look cool.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.875
Sorry. I just have to ask.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.458
Are we allowed to do this?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.875
Seems a bit morally gray
with the guns and all.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.458
We've swept the building.
It's just our team here now.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.000
Then let's get this going.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.791
I promised Ronan
we'd have the shield open by dawn.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.166
- Show-off.
- It's called style. Get some.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.625
Get some? I've got a bandanna.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.208
Unbelievable.

22:15.666 --> 22:19.000
I am Groot!

22:23.958 --> 22:25.041
Nebula.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.666
Nova Prime. I'm here to end this.

22:27.666 --> 22:30.500
You're too late.
The codes have been uploaded.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.166
<i>Shields opening.</i>

22:34.083 --> 22:36.500
<i>Ronan is entering
the atmosphere as we speak.</i>

22:38.958 --> 22:42.708
You can't stop this,
but it's not too late to join me.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.166
No, I think it is.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.500
<i>Shields closing.</i>

22:48.541 --> 22:49.958
What?

22:54.875 --> 22:57.500
The shield,
it's taking the ships down with it.

23:04.708 --> 23:07.416
The codes. You double-crossed me.

23:07.416 --> 23:08.875
Triple-crossed, actually.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.458
I saw Yon-Rogg's move a mile away.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.666
So I put my little twist on the codes.

23:13.666 --> 23:16.208
You know, machine to machine.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.666
How did you know?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.583
Seek the light, be the light.
Never stray from its path.

23:21.583 --> 23:26.000
The moment you told me to solve this
by any means necessary,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I knew you'd broken our oath.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.333
Still doesn't make it hurt any less.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.625
It's over, Nova Prime. I'm taking you in.

23:34.875 --> 23:35.875
All of you.

23:35.875 --> 23:37.333
We'll see about that.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.875
Oh, sorry. Uh. just one moment
of your time, please?

24:03.875 --> 24:05.583
Aren't you a big deal baddie?

24:06.208 --> 24:07.708
No.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.041
Oh...

24:14.041 --> 24:15.541
- He is.
- What?

24:18.750 --> 24:21.333
Ow! I should have stretched
before I did that.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.458
Throttle engines. Emergency takeoff.

25:11.833 --> 25:12.958
Take my hand.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.666
Why couldn't you just join me?

25:14.875 --> 25:16.000
I took an oath.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.458
You ruined everything.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.750
<i>Most quests for redemption
begin in darkness.</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:45.708
<i>But with a little grit,
a little faith in yourself,</i>

25:46.500 --> 25:51.416
<i>if you keep the path,
you can find your way to the light.</i>

25:52.041 --> 25:56.375
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Super Nova.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.333
You blew up our shield.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.333
You blew up our space invaders.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.208
Thanks to you, the planet's
actually getting its life back.

26:03.833 --> 26:05.833
And your liquor license is safe.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.833
Not bad for a night's work.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.583
I'll see you around, duck.
