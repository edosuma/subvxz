00:01.697 --> 00:04.961
Wow, I remember this,
this is Reese's fifth birthday.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.702
This must be Christmas
the same year.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.921
He grew up so fast.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.271
He sure did.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.621
Here's Malcolm's
first day at school.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.275
Oh...

00:14.362 --> 00:17.539
Remember when we lost Dewey
at the flea market.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.671
Still keeps great time.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.848
You want to go
through the arrest reports?

00:22.935 --> 00:24.763
I'll pour
some more wine.

Hal, do you want Raisin Bran
or oatmeal?

01:04.715 --> 01:07.241
Oatmeal.
No, wait-- Raisin Bran.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.330
No, no--

01:09.417 --> 01:10.766
oatmeal.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.247
Oh, but Raisin Bran's
got that crunch.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.683
And those raisins.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.380
But sometimes you get
too many raisins.

01:16.467 --> 01:17.860
You don't have that problem
with oatmeal.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.123
Oh, but oatmeal
can be lumpy.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.472
But sometimes good lumpy.

01:21.559 --> 01:22.908
But not usually.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.388
So definitely it's going to be

01:24.475 --> 01:27.087
Raisin Bran... no, eggs!

01:27.174 --> 01:28.566
You're having Raisin Bran.

01:28.653 --> 01:29.915
-Oh, God, thank you.
-Hal, I don't know why

01:30.002 --> 01:31.961
you have such a hard time
making decisions.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.182
Hal, sweetie,

01:35.269 --> 01:37.619
you have to decide.
For your birthday,

01:37.706 --> 01:39.795
do you want a petting zoo
or a clown?

01:39.882 --> 01:41.057
Both?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.493
[grunting]

01:42.580 --> 01:44.191
[choking]

01:44.278 --> 01:45.931
[honking, squeaking]

01:47.019 --> 01:48.717
Who knows? Probably no reason.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.720
You might as well ask me
why I'm afraid of
clowns and snakes.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.765
Morning, everybody.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.724
Hey, Craig.
Thanks for offering me

01:55.811 --> 01:57.900
-a ride to work today.
That's nice of you.
-My pleasure.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.641
Hey, gee whiz,
you know who I haven't seen

01:59.728 --> 02:01.338
in the longest time? Your boys.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.861
I think I'll just drop in
and say an innocent hello.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.604
Hey, boys, what do you say
the four of us have

02:06.691 --> 02:08.258
a giant tickle party?!

02:08.345 --> 02:09.607
Okay, that was just a cover.

02:09.693 --> 02:10.913
I didn't want
to alarm your parents.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.306
What's going on?

02:12.393 --> 02:14.003
I need you to teach me
how to fight.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.397
There's this jerk
who's always picking on me,

02:16.484 --> 02:17.789
and I'm sick of it.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.400
Why are you asking us?

02:19.487 --> 02:20.705
Because this guy's stronger
and faster than me.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.099
The only chance I've got
is if I fight dirty.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.362
And let's face it, your family
is legendary for that.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.670
Well, people exaggerate...

02:28.757 --> 02:30.150
Please, you've got to teach me
everything you know.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.934
I don't think that's
such a great idea.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.805
I mean, I teach
you some tricks,

02:33.892 --> 02:35.067
you teach them
to someone else,

02:35.155 --> 02:36.504
he teaches them
to another guy

02:36.591 --> 02:38.680
and sooner or later,
I'm in a fair fight.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.682
Sorry, Craig.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.249
What am I supposed to do?

02:43.337 --> 02:45.904
I came to you guys
asking for help

02:45.991 --> 02:48.777
because that's what I thought
friends do for their friends.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.126
Dude, calm down.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.041
I thought we meant
something to each other.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.217
I mean,
after all these years,

02:54.304 --> 02:55.827
after everything I've done
for you...

02:55.914 --> 02:56.915
Craig, stop it.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.178
I can't help it.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.570
[crying]

02:59.657 --> 03:01.355
Okay.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.357
I guess we can teach you
a few moves. Just stop crying.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.272
Really?

03:05.359 --> 03:06.577
I mean,
you're not just saying that?

03:06.664 --> 03:08.318
You'll teach me
how to fight dirty?

03:08.405 --> 03:10.015
[whimpering]

03:10.102 --> 03:11.495
Yeah. But you're gonna have
to fully commit to this.

03:11.582 --> 03:12.888
And you need to know

03:12.975 --> 03:14.368
that once you start
training with us,

03:14.455 --> 03:16.108
you're gonna see the
world differently.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.980
And there's nothing
we can ever do

03:18.067 --> 03:19.286
to restore your innocence.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.157
Thank you so much.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.725
You guys are the best.

03:23.812 --> 03:24.856
You hug me,

03:24.943 --> 03:27.076
and the lesson
starts right now.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.252
[doorbell rings]

03:29.339 --> 03:31.428
Hi, I'm Peter Rubin
from Bernstein,

03:31.515 --> 03:33.169
Wyatt and McCormick.
Are you Hal?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.476
Look, I'll tell you what
I tell all the other lawyers.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.912
Look around.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.087
This skeleton
has been picked clean.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.089
But go ahead, sue away.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.439
Actually,
that's not why I'm here.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.224
I'll leave you
a copy of the will

03:44.311 --> 03:46.095
to go through on your own,
but the bottom line is

03:46.182 --> 03:47.531
that Mr. Edelman has given you

03:47.618 --> 03:49.272
power of attorney.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.056
The family on the corner
with the boat on the lawn?

03:51.143 --> 03:52.493
I barely even knew the man.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.756
Why would he give me
power of attorney?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.584
Well, there are some difficult
family issues involved,

03:56.671 --> 03:58.238
and he wanted someone impartial.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.109
Apparently,
he considers everyone else

04:00.196 --> 04:02.067
in the neighborhood a friend.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.417
So I'm the one
that has to decide

04:03.504 --> 04:04.983
how all his stuff
gets divided?

04:05.070 --> 04:06.463
What? No.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.335
-Oh, thank God.
-No, he's not dead.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.467
He's in a coma
on life support.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.817
You have to decide
whether or not to pull the plug.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.603
What am I going to do?

04:15.690 --> 04:17.995
A man's life is in my hands.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.868
This isn't paper or plastic.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.173
This is life or death.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.349
There's nothing more
life or death

04:22.436 --> 04:23.915
than life or death.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.178
Hal, calm down.
Panicking isn't going to help.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.876
You know,
this is all your fault.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.052
-What?!
-I am completely unprepared
for this.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.706
I've had no practice.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.795
I haven't made a decision
around here in years.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.710
When exactly
did it get to the point

04:35.797 --> 04:37.538
where you make all
the decisions in our marriage?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.887
When you said,
"Lois, I want you

04:38.974 --> 04:40.541
to make all the decisions
in our marriage."

04:40.628 --> 04:43.413
Well, you didn't have
to listen to me.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.547
Oh, I got all this stuff
racing through my mind.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.679
I-I can't eat,
I can't sleep...

04:48.766 --> 04:51.682
Oh, Hal, if you want,
I'll make the decision for you.

04:51.769 --> 04:52.857
No.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.207
I was given this responsibility.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.253
A man entrusted his fate
in my hands.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.863
I can't just shrug that off.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.170
I can do this.

05:01.257 --> 05:04.304
I just need to focus
my mind on the problem
and think clearly.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.741
[inhales and exhales]

05:08.917 --> 05:10.005
Yes.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.180
I've got it.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.617
Lois, I have made the decision.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.403
Want to guess what it is?

05:16.490 --> 05:18.013
-Hal.
-Oh, all right.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.232
I'll keep trying.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.496
Craig, I'd like to welcome you

05:22.583 --> 05:25.281
to the first day of your new,
more vicious life.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.804
I give you...

05:26.891 --> 05:28.502
the human body.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.373
For clarity,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.506
we've divided it into the three
major theaters of operation.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.812
The head.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.988
The torso.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.642
And what are those?

05:38.729 --> 05:40.644
You know what those are.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.429
Now the first thing
you need to know

05:42.516 --> 05:44.344
is that this is all about pride.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.911
-Do you have pride, Craig?
-Yes.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.739
Okay, that is not the answer
I was looking for.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.306
You show me a man with pride,

05:50.393 --> 05:52.352
and I'll show you
a man with limited options.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.093
Let's say that
this is your opponent,
and he's coming after you.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.922
Hey, man, we can work this out.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.228
I didn't know she was your girl.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.273
[grunting]

06:01.361 --> 06:03.319
See? Now he's blind,

06:03.406 --> 06:05.103
and you have the time
to really get creative.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.932
Personally, I like to leave
at least one sense intact

06:08.019 --> 06:10.413
so he knows
what's happening to him.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.284
I knew I came
to the right place.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.721
Okay, Dewey, you're up.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.288
Okay, first,
I'm going to need you

06:16.376 --> 06:17.855
to take off your glasses.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.901
Ow! My eyes!

06:19.988 --> 06:22.294
[crying]
I didn't know we were starting!

06:22.382 --> 06:24.819
There is no starting
in dirty fighting.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.473
Life is one big fight

06:26.560 --> 06:28.213
from the day you're born
to the day you die.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.478
Okay. Maybe we should
slow down a little.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.175
[crying]
Ow!

06:33.262 --> 06:36.178
Time out! Time out!

06:36.265 --> 06:37.571
[crying]

06:37.658 --> 06:39.268
I think we're
wasting our time here.

06:39.355 --> 06:39.964
Let's just kick him in the
kidneys and call it a night.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.879
No! Please!

06:41.966 --> 06:44.404
I know I suck,
but I want to be better.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.363
Please, I'll try harder,
I promise.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.321
Let me try something.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.585
All right, Craig, listen.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.978
I want you to think.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.850
I want you to visualize
every bully

06:55.937 --> 06:58.461
that ever picked on you
or beat you up.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.941
Really see the look

07:00.028 --> 07:01.682
of contempt on their faces

07:01.769 --> 07:02.857
as they pounded on you.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.946
-You got it?
-Mm-hmm.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.688
Now picture
what they were looking at.

07:07.775 --> 07:08.689
Oh.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.473
It's disgusting!

07:10.560 --> 07:12.257
[crazed yelling]

07:15.086 --> 07:16.348
[crazed yelling continues]

07:25.357 --> 07:27.447
[crazed yelling continues]

07:30.406 --> 07:31.625
Is he going
for the plums?

07:31.712 --> 07:33.017
It appears so.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.019
[bat whipping the air,
Craig grunting]

07:35.106 --> 07:36.281
[Craig growling]

07:36.368 --> 07:38.283
Well, he sure won't have
to worry

07:38.370 --> 07:40.198
about the guy's children
coming after him.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.593
[machine beeping rhythmically]
Now, who's going to be
on rounds?

07:43.680 --> 07:44.812
[whispers]
Look at him.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.814
He can't even move,

07:46.901 --> 07:49.469
and still you can see
how much he's suffering.

07:49.556 --> 07:53.255
Lying there,
enduring the pain,

07:53.342 --> 07:56.519
hour after endless hour.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.043
You can see in his face
he's just begging

07:59.130 --> 08:01.089
to be put out
of his misery.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.786
It's awful.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.962
Oh, God, yes.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.139
Look at him.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.837
Look how hard
he's fighting.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.057
Those clenched hands,
the set of his jaw.

08:13.144 --> 08:16.800
It's inspiring to
see such a fierce
will to live.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.107
He really wants
to make it.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.109
It's beautiful.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.720
He's really gonna...

08:23.807 --> 08:25.722
[sniffles]

08:27.202 --> 08:29.509
[indistinct voices,
woman on intercom]

08:31.554 --> 08:33.251
Here's extra pudding if...

08:33.337 --> 08:35.645
[Hal screaming and crying]

08:35.732 --> 08:37.604
Okay, it was
a good plan

08:37.691 --> 08:39.909
having the guy
meet you here.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.347
We've set up a few things to
give you a little edge
if you get in trouble.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.219
There's a broken bottle
in that pile of leaves,

08:44.306 --> 08:45.916
and a can of bug spray
under the Big Wheel.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.136
If it runs out, it still makes
a great blunt object.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.833
Remember, we're
here for you.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.835
Unless it looks like
you're getting a total beating.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.228
Then I may have
to take his side.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.751
Don't worry.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.710
I hate this guy
more than anyone on Earth.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.059
This jerk is going to finally

08:58.146 --> 09:00.496
get what he deserves.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.541
MAN:
Craigy?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.281
Is that you back there?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.761
Hello,

09:04.848 --> 09:06.458
Dad.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.071
[crazed yelling]

09:14.205 --> 09:16.033
[yelling and choking]

09:16.120 --> 09:19.254
For God's sake, son,

09:19.341 --> 09:21.299
you have no upper body
strength at all.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.519
I know girls that could get out
of this hold.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.783
[strained]
Get your foot off my neck
so I can kill you.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.393
Craigy, do you have any idea

09:28.480 --> 09:30.047
how pathetic you look right now?

09:30.134 --> 09:31.353
Do you even care?

09:31.440 --> 09:32.920
Are you so wrapped up
with being

09:33.007 --> 09:35.575
a useless piece of pudge
that you can't even see

09:35.662 --> 09:37.577
how embarrassed
you're making me?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.013
[ choking]

09:39.100 --> 09:41.668
Um, I think he needs to breathe.
[Craig choking]

09:41.755 --> 09:43.713
I'm going to let you up now.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.716
I want you to dust yourself off,
suck in your gut,

09:46.803 --> 09:49.066
and introduce me
to your friends.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.112
I'm not doing anything
you tell me.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.200
I hate you.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.810
And I wasn't even choking.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.290
I was faking it.
[sighs]

09:55.377 --> 09:56.944
Vic Feldspar.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.510
Nice to meet you, boys.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.469
I'm this one's father,
I guess.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.210
Father? Ha!

10:02.297 --> 10:04.255
You pretended not to know me
at the father-son picnic.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.344
Sorry I wasn't
swelling with pride

10:06.431 --> 10:07.737
while I watched you

10:07.824 --> 10:09.696
suck the butter off
other people's corncobs.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.349
You wonder why
I'm so messed up?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.482
It's because
from the day I was born,

10:13.569 --> 10:15.397
I've heard nothing
but four-count Burpees

10:15.484 --> 10:18.313
and constant,
lisping criticism.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.445
Why don't you go back
to San Diego

10:20.532 --> 10:21.882
and all your macho friends?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.535
I'm not leaving

10:23.623 --> 10:26.277
until you seriously
think about my offer.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.366
I don't want
your stupid gymnasiums.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.541
I told you.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
Craigy, the people in Chicago

10:31.718 --> 10:32.762
put in a very nice bid.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.764
I can't put them
off anymore.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.679
This is your last chance.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.595
He wants to give you
a string of gymnasiums?

10:39.682 --> 10:41.597
As long as he can get me
back under his thumb.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.686
Actually, I'm giving
them up either way.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.122
It's time for me to retire.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.603
I got a top of the
line Fleetwood RV.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.910
I'm going to drag it across
America with my teeth.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.434
Son, don't be an idiot.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.958
There is still a
chance I can fix you.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.133
I don't care.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.005
I'm not going back with you.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.268
I escaped,
and I'm staying escaped.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.749
Okay, you're
obviously hysterical.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.012
I've got to start
my 30-mile run.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.755
That gives you two hours
and 16 minutes to calm down.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.234
Meet me at Applebee's,

11:10.321 --> 11:12.019
and we'll try to discuss
this like grown-ups.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.935
I'll come, but it'll be

11:15.022 --> 11:16.588
for the great service
and atmosphere,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.765
not for you!

11:24.988 --> 11:26.294
Dad, what are you doing?

11:26.381 --> 11:28.470
I am making
a decision tree.

11:28.557 --> 11:32.474
It is a tool to help you
make difficult decisions.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.868
First, I started out
with two branches,

11:34.955 --> 11:36.217
one for pulling the plug,

11:36.304 --> 11:37.653
the other one for
keeping him alive.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.394
Then I made branches
from those branches

11:39.481 --> 11:41.222
for all the possible outcomes.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.876
I'm getting it all
out of my head

11:42.963 --> 11:44.747
so I can see what
I'm dealing with logically.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.228
"Pulling plug causes feeling
of Godlike power.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.882
Forced to kill again"?

11:48.969 --> 11:51.014
Well, I'm trying
to cover everything.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.669
But now I have gone through
all the possibilities,

11:53.756 --> 11:56.324
and I really think I am
zeroing in on a decision.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.934
All your outcomes
on "pull the plug"

11:58.021 --> 11:59.544
assume that he dies
right away.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.808
Yes, Dewey, that's what
pulling the plug means.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.461
Not necessarily.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.202
He could continue
to live without his respirator,

12:05.289 --> 12:06.551
his body wasting away

12:06.638 --> 12:07.944
while he struggles for breath,

12:08.031 --> 12:09.772
like a fish on a dock
gasping for air,

12:09.859 --> 12:13.080
slowly suffocating over the
course of weeks or even months.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.646
I read about this one...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.648
Thank you, Dewey.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.867
Like I don't get enough

12:17.954 --> 12:19.695
of the know-it-all stuff
from Malcolm.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.612
Here you go, Craig.
I made your favorite;

12:23.699 --> 12:25.222
lemon meringue pie.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.311
I want to thank you people
for your hospitality.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.183
Opening your house up to me

12:29.270 --> 12:31.794
and the living
garbage disposal over here.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.448
It's our pleasure.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.102
I hope you like dinner.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.452
I wasn't sure whether
to make a chicken or a ham.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.150
[scoffs]
Chicken or ham, boy,
that's a tough one.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.282
Chicken or ham.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.371
You're life must
be a living hell.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.112
So, did Craig tell you

12:45.199 --> 12:47.462
how he got honorable mention
for his community gardens?

12:47.549 --> 12:48.942
Sitting on his ass
making food?

12:49.029 --> 12:50.073
Sounds about right.

12:52.162 --> 12:55.296
[phone rings]

12:55.383 --> 12:56.688
Hello.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.127
Oh, yes, Dr. Samson.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.043
Hal, you promised us
a decision a week ago.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.175
The hospital needs this room
for urgent care patients.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.395
Now, we have to either
pull the plug on Mr. Edelman

13:07.482 --> 13:09.919
or move him to a private
intensive care facility.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.792
We have to have
your decision now, right now.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.272
Okay, listen, I'm going
to need your help here.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.144
Just strictly
from an emotionless,

13:17.231 --> 13:18.754
purely medical standpoint,

13:18.841 --> 13:20.364
what should I do?

13:20.451 --> 13:22.323
Pull the plug.
Let him live.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.325
Damn it, Georgie,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.806
you know the chances for
a coma patient waking up
are practically zero.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.243
Practically zero
does not mean zero.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.984
Why the hell
do you give up so easily?

13:31.071 --> 13:33.073
He's shown no activity,
no responsiveness,

13:33.160 --> 13:35.336
no eye movement for
a month-- it's over.

13:35.423 --> 13:36.990
You know as well as I
that patients can be in

13:37.077 --> 13:38.469
a persistent vegetative state
for years

13:38.556 --> 13:39.775
and still recover.

13:39.862 --> 13:40.820
We can argue about
this all day.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.343
We're not going
to get anywhere.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.648
It's up to you.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.954
Just put
an "X" somewhere.

13:48.958 --> 13:49.785
What's wrong with him?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.395
The doctors called it

13:51.482 --> 13:52.614
"hysterical conversion
disorder."

13:52.701 --> 13:54.181
It's psychosomatic.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.270
Apparently, he's paralyzed
from the waist up.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.141
Waist up?

13:58.228 --> 14:02.363
[strained grunting]

14:04.669 --> 14:05.583
Dad, what is it?

14:05.670 --> 14:06.846
[whining]

14:16.551 --> 14:19.554
I think
he's thanking you.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.991
CRAIG:
Dad, what are you doing here?

14:22.078 --> 14:23.471
I told you no
at Applebee's,

14:23.558 --> 14:25.255
no at Malcolm's house

14:25.342 --> 14:28.041
and no all the way home
as you jogged alongside my car.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.565
I wanted to give you something.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.349
What is it?

14:32.436 --> 14:34.786
Used to call that
your unk-unk.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.179
Your mother bought
that for you

14:36.266 --> 14:37.746
the day she found out
she was pregnant.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.009
The only day
I saw her happier

14:40.096 --> 14:42.533
was the day
you were born.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.795
Wow.

14:44.448 --> 14:47.060
I haven't been totally
honest with you, son,

14:47.147 --> 14:50.150
but before I go,
I owe you the truth.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.630
I never made it a secret
how disappointed I am

14:52.717 --> 14:54.154
with the way you turned out.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.069
But what you don't know is

14:56.156 --> 15:00.029
if your mother
was alive today,

15:00.116 --> 15:02.292
she's be just as disappointed.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.728
What?

15:03.815 --> 15:06.079
Opening those gyms
wasn't just my dream,

15:06.166 --> 15:07.994
it was your mother's dream, too.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.300
Fitness was her life,

15:10.387 --> 15:13.477
and it was her dying wish
for you to embrace a life

15:13.564 --> 15:15.262
of health and vitality.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.742
Why didn't you
ever tell me that?

15:17.829 --> 15:20.876
Because I kept thinking
if I pushed you enough,

15:20.963 --> 15:23.487
eventually you'd turn
yourself around.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.273
But apparently to you,

15:26.360 --> 15:31.234
I'm an annoyance,
not an inspiration.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.410
-No, you're...
-It doesn't really matter.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.935
Your mom's in heaven now,

15:36.022 --> 15:38.241
crying at the waste
you made of your life.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.113
I know you don't want

15:40.200 --> 15:42.637
to run those gyms to please me,

15:42.724 --> 15:45.335
but you might want to consider
doing it for your mother.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.515
Do those jumpsuits
come in extra large?

15:51.602 --> 15:55.911
[voice breaking]
I waited all my life
to hear those words.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.960
LOIS:
It's been four days, Hal.

16:01.047 --> 16:01.917
I've tried to be patient,
but this has gone on

16:02.004 --> 16:03.179
long enough.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.224
[toilet flushes]

16:04.311 --> 16:05.965
You've got to snap out of it.

16:06.052 --> 16:09.055
Look, I'll admit
you've been resourceful.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.535
You've learned
to do so many things,

16:11.622 --> 16:13.233
and the sex has been
interesting,

16:13.320 --> 16:14.843
but you can't go on
living like this.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.323
Don't think I don't know

16:16.410 --> 16:18.325
what this is all about, Hal.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.631
You're trying to avoid
making this decision.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.807
This is not going to work.

16:22.894 --> 16:25.593
And frankly, this whole
thing is beneath you.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.551
It's a cowards way out, Hal.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.858
[ brushing sound]

16:29.945 --> 16:33.775
You think I wouldn't like
a paralyzed vacation,

16:33.862 --> 16:35.603
everyone waiting on me
hand and foot?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.344
But you know what?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.910
It doesn't work that way.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.521
You can't make up
ridiculous illnesses

16:40.608 --> 16:43.045
to get out of doing
what you don't want to do.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.095
Oh, for God's sake,

16:49.182 --> 16:52.054
do you have any idea
how insane you're acting?

16:52.141 --> 16:54.230
I'm just glad that your boys
aren't here to see this.

16:57.103 --> 17:01.368
Oh, Hal, you changed Jamie's
diapers with those feet.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.374
[Hal grunting]

17:07.461 --> 17:08.549
Hal?!

17:12.509 --> 17:14.598
Reese, how could you
just leave him in there?

17:14.685 --> 17:16.470
Every time I pulled him out,
Jamie started crying.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.300
[Jamie cries]

17:24.173 --> 17:25.695
Okay, this is
ending right now.

17:25.782 --> 17:27.698
You are going to stop
being paralyzed

17:27.785 --> 17:29.700
and you are going
to make this decision.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.487
I know you think
you can't do this.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.663
I know you're worried
you'll choose wrong,

17:35.750 --> 17:37.360
but Hal, you had
a very hard choice

17:37.447 --> 17:38.753
to make in your life before

17:38.840 --> 17:40.320
and you made not only
a good decision,

17:40.407 --> 17:42.061
you made a brilliant one--

17:42.148 --> 17:45.325
you decided to marry me.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.501
No one thought
it was a good idea.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.111
All your friends thought

17:49.198 --> 17:50.591
you were making
a horrible mistake.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.767
Your parents,
my parents.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.248
They all said I was
a pushy, opinionated
loudmouth,

17:55.335 --> 17:57.598
but you knew
I was perfect for you.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.426
And I am.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.471
It's the best decision
anyone's ever made.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.082
Every day I wake up

18:03.169 --> 18:06.476
grateful or that brilliant,
brilliant decision.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.522
And you can
do it again, Hal.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.263
I know you can.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.051
But with you
it was obvious.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.620
Even so, honey.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.839
VIC:
You better say
your good-byes quickly.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.189
We need to squeeze in
a lake swim

18:23.276 --> 18:24.364
before we head
to the airport.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.192
But...
Ready? Begin.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.671
I'll miss you guys.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.108
Craig, you don't have
to do this.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.892
Let's face it.
I don't have any better options.

18:30.979 --> 18:31.980
[watch beeps]

18:32.067 --> 18:33.329
It's your lunchtime.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.769
That's his lunch?

18:38.856 --> 18:40.467
Every day until
he drops 90 pounds.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.034
These pills here
are my own formula.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.211
It's got three times
the RDA

18:45.298 --> 18:47.256
of the all you basic
vitamins and nutrients.

18:47.343 --> 18:51.086
Sadly, it doesn't
contain any character.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.218
See ya, Craig.

18:52.305 --> 18:53.741
I guess this means

18:53.828 --> 18:55.438
I don't owe you that
50 bucks anymore.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.528
I'll think of you

18:58.615 --> 18:59.790
every time I open
a jar of mayonnaise.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.966
So, um, Vic,

19:02.053 --> 19:04.230
Craig's mom was
a real fitness buff, huh?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.362
Absolutely.
She did a triathlon

19:06.449 --> 19:08.147
the day after giving birth
to Craig.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.974
There was no stopping
that woman.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.238
Really?
No stopping

19:12.325 --> 19:14.022
this woman?!

19:14.109 --> 19:15.545
Give that back.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.461
Mama?

19:18.548 --> 19:22.073
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.250
I thought you said
all the photos of her

19:24.337 --> 19:25.642
were destroyed in the
twister that killed her.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.383
What did you want
me to say,

19:27.470 --> 19:29.255
that your mother
ran out on me

19:29.342 --> 19:31.039
with a guy
who owned a pie shop?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.649
That after years

19:32.736 --> 19:35.565
of slaving away
to give that woman everything,

19:35.652 --> 19:37.698
she decided she wasn't
attracted to me anymore?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.613
That I wasn't man enough
for her?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.005
Come on, Craig.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.877
What would that have done
to your self-esteem?

19:42.964 --> 19:45.575
So, my mom is alive?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.055
Oh, great.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.100
So, now this all going
to be about her.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.277
How could you
do this to me?

19:51.364 --> 19:53.888
How could you lie to
me all these years?

19:53.975 --> 19:55.803
I did what I thought
was best for you.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.196
No, you didn't.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.588
You did what you thought
would punish her.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.242
All this time, you
weren't yelling at me,

20:00.329 --> 20:03.289
but at this beautiful,
beautiful woman.

20:03.376 --> 20:07.206
Dad, I'm not
going with you.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.208
My life isn't a mess.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.035
I love my life.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.733
I love my job,
I love my cat,

20:12.820 --> 20:14.604
I love my friends.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.693
I've made something
of myself.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.652
I'm Desk Sergeant at
my Neighborhood Watch,

20:18.739 --> 20:20.828
and a 14th-level elf cleric.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.309
I am not going
to throw that away.

20:23.396 --> 20:27.008
You almost sounded
like a man for a second.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.402
Good-bye, Dad.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.887
You actually have
a pretty good grip there, son.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.021
It's my joystick hand.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.153
Hal, I am so
proud of you

20:42.241 --> 20:44.460
for making
such a great decision.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.680
And such a surprising one.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.464
I thought your only choices
were life or death.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.510
Who would have thought
there was a third option?

20:50.597 --> 20:52.816
People aren't willing
to think outside the box.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.992
See, the answer
was there all the time.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.211
Someone just had to see it.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.734
[chuckles]

20:57.821 --> 20:59.127
Once I found out
he was a bird lover,

20:59.214 --> 21:00.433
well, it all made sense.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.043
And everything
was at Radio Shack?

21:02.130 --> 21:03.784
Everything but the hat.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.133
You know what, Hal?

21:05.220 --> 21:06.482
Your solution
was so brilliant,

21:06.569 --> 21:08.702
would you mind
walking me through it

21:08.789 --> 21:10.007
one more time,
step-by-step,

21:10.094 --> 21:11.879
just so I understand
it completely?

21:11.966 --> 21:14.011
Honey, no,
it was so exhausting.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.492
I don't think
I'll talk about it ever again.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.538
Well, I suppose
it's for the best.
