-Shut up.

-I found John!
-Idiot.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.435
-[Nandor] It's John!
-Fucking idiot.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.075

That was, uh, some pretty
heavy stuff at dinner, huh?

17:22.109 --> 17:23.443
[chuckles]

17:23.477 --> 17:26.413

17:30.584 --> 17:32.486
Sorry.
[short chuckle]

17:32.519 --> 17:35.322
Where was I? Um...

17:35.355 --> 17:38.025
I was hemorrhaging profusely,
uh, about to die.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.160
-You good?
-[grunts] Yeah.

17:40.194 --> 17:42.062
-Yeah, I think so.
-Well, that's good.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.198
-'Cause I haven't done it yet.
-Oh, dude.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.066
Other people's blood
I'm fine with.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.168
But the sight of my own?
No, thank you.

17:48.202 --> 17:49.436
You know, when I think
about fainting, I faint.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.572

-Um...
-I'm running out of time
here, buddy.

17:55.609 --> 17:57.711
Here. Why don't you slice me up
with this box cutter?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.313
Are you sure?
It's gonna hurt.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.648
-I'm a vampire.
I think I can handle it.
-Okay.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.153
-Did you do it?
-Yeah, I did.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.187
-But don't look because--
-Don't look at what?

18:07.221 --> 18:08.188
-Oh, shit.
-No, Derek.

18:08.222 --> 18:09.523

Oh...

Okay, sorry, dude,
I got to go take care of this.

That's where we're at.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.205
[Guillermo]
It seems to be

18:58.238 --> 18:59.740
a process.

18:59.773 --> 19:03.443
I thought the transformation
would be faster,

19:03.477 --> 19:05.579
but I haven't drank blood.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.214
I can still eat human foods.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.984
In fact, my appetite
for very rare meat is ravenous.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.623
My teeth are
totally normal and...

19:16.657 --> 19:18.692
I don't feel any sexier.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.961
I can still go out into the sun.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.033
I can't fly or turn into a bat.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.034
Yet.

Bat!

Human form.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.438
I thought the transformation

19:31.471 --> 19:34.741
would be overnight,
but it's been 16 days.

19:34.775 --> 19:36.577
Which is why I've been
keeping it a secret.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.546
I was kind of holding off
for that big

19:39.580 --> 19:41.615
"wow factor" for the reveal,
but at this point,

19:41.648 --> 19:43.450
I don't even think
I should tell them because--

19:43.483 --> 19:45.586
-[optometrist] Mr. de la Corz?
-Uh, so sorry about that.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.587

19:46.620 --> 19:48.188
-De la Cruz.
-Hi.

19:48.222 --> 19:49.590
How long have you been
wearing glasses

19:49.623 --> 19:50.624
with this prescription?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.426
Oh, since I was three or four?

19:52.459 --> 19:53.994
I-I don't know
who screwed up here,

19:54.027 --> 19:57.130
but you actually
don't need glasses at all.

19:57.164 --> 19:58.532
According to the eye exam
you just did,

19:58.565 --> 20:00.667
you have 20/20 vision.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.402
It's actually better than
20/20 vision.

20:02.436 --> 20:03.704
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

20:03.737 --> 20:06.039
Well, that is...

20:06.073 --> 20:09.009
a super power.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.445
-Wow, that's... Wow.
-So, right now, you're wearing

20:11.478 --> 20:13.714
a very strong prescription
for no reason.

-Let's stop doing that.
-Let's stop doing that.

20:15.082 --> 20:16.216
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Yeah, okay.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.452
Would it be possible
to just get a pair

20:18.485 --> 20:20.153
without a prescription?

20:20.187 --> 20:21.355
Just, I don't want
people to think

20:21.388 --> 20:24.291
I look... different.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.027
Uh, yeah. Sure.
You want the same frames or...

It was all right, Master.

20:36.103 --> 20:37.304
I guess I wasn't really
that hungry.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.439
And that is okay.

20:39.473 --> 20:40.741
Do the other side.

20:40.774 --> 20:43.343
-Master?
-Mm-hmm?

If I accidentally

20:45.612 --> 20:48.015
got made into a vampire...

-Mm-hmm?
-by somebody else,

20:49.082 --> 20:50.584
you wouldn't really...

20:50.617 --> 20:52.152
kill me, would you?

20:53.487 --> 20:55.155
Accidentally, you say?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.993
-Yes.
-Not intentionally?

21:00.761 --> 21:04.398
No, I guess... not.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.668
I'd still have to kill you.
What choice would I have?

21:07.701 --> 21:11.171
What about "vampire shall not
kill other vampire"?

21:11.205 --> 21:13.207

before bedtime.

21:15.509 --> 21:17.177
-You know this.
-Right.

21:17.211 --> 21:19.179
Makes my head heat up.

21:19.213 --> 21:24.084
How's about
a nice bedtime story?

21:24.117 --> 21:27.321
Okay. I did see
this very interesting movie

21:27.354 --> 21:28.722
the other night.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.658
-Oh, tell me.
-It was about this guy.

-And he got turned
into a vampire.

21:34.194 --> 21:35.696
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.331
But then he realizes that maybe

21:37.364 --> 21:40.701
he wasn't ready
to be turned into a vampire.

21:40.734 --> 21:41.702
Why not?

21:43.370 --> 21:45.038
He had his reasons.
But then

21:45.072 --> 21:46.673
he tries to find a way to

21:46.707 --> 21:48.675
stop the process of becoming
a vampire and rever--

21:48.709 --> 21:50.043
Guillermo, please.

21:50.077 --> 21:52.579
I don't like
science-fiction stories

21:52.613 --> 21:54.581

-Yeah.
