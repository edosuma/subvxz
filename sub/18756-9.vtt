WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(lively symphonic music)

00:05.106 --> 00:06.907
WOMAN: Welcome back to our
coverage of the Joshies

00:06.940 --> 00:09.577
live here on the red carpet.
Mike,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.145
Mike, can we chat
with you for a minute?

00:11.179 --> 00:12.380
- Yes.
- How are you?

00:12.413 --> 00:14.148
- How are you?
You look stunning.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.016
- The brilliant Mike Scaggs
is with me now,

00:16.050 --> 00:18.686
nominated for the award that
everyone is talking about--

00:18.719 --> 00:20.521
best man at Josh's wedding.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.423
- What is up?
(both laugh)

00:22.456 --> 00:24.525
- How are you feeling?
- Humbled.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.260
There's some great dudes
in this category.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.429
- Your friendship with Josh
has been a smash hit.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.064
How did you decide
to get involved in the project?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.232
- You know,
Josh first approached me

00:31.265 --> 00:32.400
about ten years ago.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.902
Uh, at the time,
I was at a party,

00:34.935 --> 00:36.570
slamming shots of Jager.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.906
He walked up and was like,
"Can I get in on that?"

00:38.939 --> 00:40.508
I was like, "Hell yeah, bro."

00:40.541 --> 00:42.410
- Now, you must be nervous
about tonight.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.945
- The way I see it, it's all up
to the big man upstairs...

00:44.978 --> 00:46.580
Josh.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.250
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
Josh Greenberg.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.820
(orchestral flourish)

00:53.987 --> 00:57.458
- Passion, preparedness,

00:57.491 --> 00:59.360
cool to hang with--

00:59.393 --> 01:03.097
these are the qualities
of a best man.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.466
And the nominees are...

01:05.499 --> 01:07.601
Doug, "The Extra Beer."

01:09.069 --> 01:10.304
- Hey, man,
they gave me an extra beer.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.106
Want it?
- Sure.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.152
Tom, "The Lift to the Airport."

01:26.487 --> 01:28.122
- Josh?

01:28.156 --> 01:29.623
Oh, we should
probably get going.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.659
- All right.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.896
- (speaking indistinctly)

01:35.929 --> 01:38.732
- Nikhil, "The Life Saver."

01:38.766 --> 01:40.134
(dogs barking)
(yells)

01:42.470 --> 01:43.937
- Oh, my God! Look out!
(gunshot)

01:43.971 --> 01:46.574
- (distorted) No!
(dramatic music)

01:46.607 --> 01:47.908
(groans)
- Oh, my God.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.911
You saved my life.
- Of course.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.414
You're my best friend.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.883
- When did that happen?

01:57.218 --> 02:00.521
- And, finally, Mike Scaggs,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.490
"Ten Years of Friendship."

02:02.523 --> 02:05.426
(cheerful guitar music)

02:05.459 --> 02:07.161
*

02:15.503 --> 02:19.407
BOTH: Oh! Boom!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.977
(cheering, applause)
- Thank you. Stop. Stop.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.714
- And the best man goes to...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.316
Mike Scaggs,
"Ten Years of Friendship."

02:28.349 --> 02:30.551
- Come on!
Yes!

02:30.584 --> 02:32.119
- ANNOUNCER: This is the first
nomination... - What?!

02:32.152 --> 02:35.323
and first win
as best man for Mike Scaggs.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.824
- (laughing)
We did it, man!

02:36.857 --> 02:38.359
- Yeah.
- We did it!

02:38.392 --> 02:41.695
Oh, gimme this. Oh.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.465
This is for every guy
who's ever been told

02:44.498 --> 02:46.867
he is weird
for hanging out with Josh.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.703
To all those dudes,
I'm living proof.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.572
It is all worth it.
Dreams do come true.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.073
(string music plays)
Ah, no, they're playing me off.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.576
Uh, uh, okay.
Wait, um... Uh,

02:55.609 --> 02:58.246
thank you, Barry Sanderson,
Gina Gordon, Terry Stephens.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.348
We did it, Terry!
Uh, oh, shit.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.816
Oh, what... Yeah!
Uh, uh, the whales. Right.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.985
Um, every day,
four whales are killed,

03:05.018 --> 03:08.656
and that's way too many,
so, uh, you know,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.691
donate to that shit.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.527
I want to thank Cameron Crowe!
I want to thank Tom Cruise!

03:13.561 --> 03:14.662
And I want to thank Josh!

03:14.695 --> 03:17.064
He's my best friend
in the whole wide world.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.032
We've been through
everything, brother.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.834
I love you, brother.
- Okay.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.935
Okay.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.971
- Yes.
- Yeah!

03:30.143 --> 03:33.146
(downtempo electronic music)

03:34.147 --> 03:35.649
- Aah!

03:38.952 --> 03:40.954
- (squeaks)

03:42.756 --> 03:44.057
- (growls)

04:00.173 --> 04:01.775
- Dude, I still can't believe
you picked me

04:01.809 --> 04:03.110
to be your best man.
- Of course, buddy.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.445
You know me better
than anyone else.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.047
- True dat.
Ah, I'll get this.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.816
Yes, we will have
two burritos,

04:08.849 --> 04:10.818
ultra nasty
with extra drippings,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.986
butt blaster sauce,
extra blasty,

04:13.020 --> 04:14.888
and a couple
of thick-boy IPAs.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.158
- Ah, I'm-I'm trying to
cut down on the butt blasting.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.394
Uh, can I just get, like,
a... maybe a fish taco

04:20.428 --> 04:21.662
and a bottle of water?
- (cackles)

04:21.695 --> 04:22.930
Yeah, right.
Good one, bro.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.832
- Oh, my God.
- Bon apple-tits.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.734
I got food poisoning
last time I was here.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.968
Yeah, their meat is old.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.305
Got your bachelor party
all mapped out.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.406
6:00 p.m., party starts.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.742
8:00 p.m., blackout drunk.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.944
10:00 p.m.,
blackout drunk again.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.947
Midnight, party starts.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.949
What? Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, that...

04:41.982 --> 04:44.785
- Yeah.
- That-that all sounds, uh...

04:44.818 --> 04:47.488
overwhelming.
- (laughs) Oh, yeah, big time.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.922
(laughing)
- Oh, I know.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.023
- Eat that shit.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.093
- (groans)

04:53.126 --> 04:54.194
- You should probably
get going soon

04:54.227 --> 04:55.796
to that strip club.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.164
Traffic around the airport's
always crazy.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.999
- Yeah, you're right.
(sighs)

04:59.032 --> 05:00.368
- What's the matter?

05:00.401 --> 05:02.336
- I am just dreading
this bachelor party.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.538
I'm gonna be stuck there
all night, unable to leave,

05:04.572 --> 05:07.307
and all I feel like doing
is staying in with you

05:07.341 --> 05:09.176
and watching Shark Tank.
- Oh, come on.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.211
There's plenty of time
to do that.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.680
Relax, go hang out
with Mike.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.282
How bad could it be?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.351
(airplane flies overhead)
- ALL: Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug!

05:17.385 --> 05:18.352
- Aah!
ALL: Chug! Chug! Chug!

05:18.386 --> 05:19.487
- Aah!
(all cheer)

05:19.520 --> 05:20.688
- Whoo!
- There you go, baby!

05:20.721 --> 05:22.623
- Aah!
- Yeah!

05:22.656 --> 05:23.891
(all yelling)
- Whoo-hoo!

05:23.924 --> 05:25.526
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

05:25.559 --> 05:26.827
- Feels like
it's probably got to be

05:26.860 --> 05:28.362
almost last call,
right, boys?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.498
- No way, dude.
This place is 24 hours.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.832
- It's what?
- Lock the doors

05:31.865 --> 05:33.467
and throw away the keys, baby.
- Oh, no!

05:33.501 --> 05:35.636
- Yeah!
Whoo!

05:35.669 --> 05:39.206
- Can I, uh, make a phone call?
- No problem.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.574
But, Greenberg...
- Yeah.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.909
- Be quick about it.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.912
(foreboding music)

05:44.945 --> 05:48.882
*

05:48.916 --> 05:51.685
(melancholy string music)

05:51.719 --> 05:54.822
*

05:54.855 --> 05:56.657
(door slams shut)

05:56.690 --> 05:58.692
*

05:58.726 --> 06:02.229
- How you doing?
- Uh, hanging in there.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.264
How's life on the outside?
- It's fine.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.199
Uh, I just, uh, finished
an episode of Shark Tank.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.702
This guy pitched these socks
that you can kinda draw on,

06:08.736 --> 06:10.504
so, like-like, you can,
like, customize the socks

06:10.538 --> 06:11.739
and, like, write things
on the socks--

06:11.772 --> 06:12.840
like, if you're on a team...
- (sobs)

06:12.873 --> 06:14.508
- Oh, God...

06:14.542 --> 06:16.209
I'm sorry.
Did you want me to wait?

06:16.243 --> 06:20.514
- No, no, you...
you need to live your life.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.616
From now on,
just pretend I'm dead.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.851
- Don't talk like that.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.252
- You don't know
what it's like in here.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.353
You don't know what it's like.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.555
- What's that mark on your face?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.256
Josh, did someone hurt you?

06:29.289 --> 06:33.360
- It's nothing.
- What happened, Josh?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.862
- A titty hit me in the face.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.864
- (sighs)
Oh, Josh.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.800
- I don't suppose the, uh,
governor's answered my letters.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.235
- No.
- That do-nothing son of a...

06:42.269 --> 06:45.272
- Josh... Hey, hey, hey!
Josh! Hey.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.807
(whispers) Hey, hey, hey...
- (sobbing)

06:46.840 --> 06:49.610
- You stay with me.
Stay with me, all right?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.445
Listen to me, okay?

06:51.479 --> 06:55.415
You do whatever you need to do
to get through this, all right?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.785
You do your shots,
you take your lap dances,

06:57.818 --> 06:59.887
and you come home to me,
all right?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.824
But, Josh, don't do
anything stupid, okay?

07:05.593 --> 07:08.328
- Aah!
(laughing)

07:08.361 --> 07:11.732
- Greenberg!
Uh-oh, there we go.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.133
- Yeah.
- Starting to get

07:13.166 --> 07:14.502
a little bit worried
about you, buddy.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.736
- Oh, no, I am-I am here...
(all laughing)

07:15.769 --> 07:17.805
And-and having, uh,
lots of fun.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.473
- That's what I like to hear.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.909
Bartender, give us five
of your grossest shots.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.644
We want the shit
nobody buys.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.580
(cackles)
(all laughing)

07:26.614 --> 07:28.482
Whoo!
- (cheers)

07:28.516 --> 07:29.817
- Mm.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.654
Yeah! Drink up, shitbirds.
Let's do this!

07:33.687 --> 07:36.456
Where's Josh?
- I think he went that way.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.291
- Joshie!

07:38.325 --> 07:40.494
Josh.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.863
Josh!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.698
God damn it, where is he?
(grunts)

07:44.732 --> 07:47.768
(bottle clatters into distance)

07:47.801 --> 07:50.504
*

07:50.538 --> 07:52.773
What the hell?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.808
*

08:02.550 --> 08:04.518
(whispers) No.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.721
Josh?
Josh?

08:07.755 --> 08:11.725
(roars)
Josh!

08:11.759 --> 08:14.294
- Hey, man, could we go ahead
and cut the cake?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.396
- (whispers) Whatever.
- Cool.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.567
I'll start the traditional way
by separating the two halves.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.570
(melancholy piano music)

08:22.603 --> 08:24.304
*

08:24.337 --> 08:25.338
Perfect.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.574
*

08:31.244 --> 08:34.414
- Okay, great.
Excellent.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.516
Tom will be here.
Liz will be there.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.351
The bridesmaids are here.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.254
Uh, looks like the only thing
I need now is the best man.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.990
- Yeah.
- Still no best man?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.326
- Uh, no, no, he...
he still hasn't made it yet.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.161
- Okay, so wait.
Why isn't Mike here?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.497
- Ah, you know him, he's-
he's a real party animal.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.665
He's probably just hungover.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.434
- I thought you guys quit
at, like, 10:30 last night.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.671
- I-I... I quit
at 10:30 last night.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.240
It's a possibility they might
have gone a teensy bit longer.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.409
- Josh, you bailed?
- I didn't bail.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.344
I did not bail.
- Josh. -(mouths)

09:04.377 --> 09:06.346
- Yeah, okay, they think I did.
Just, I'd like...

09:06.379 --> 09:08.248
it's not a big deal.
I left a bit early.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.883
Who cares about
some stupid party?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.418
- Who wants to see
the bachelorette party pictures?

09:11.451 --> 09:12.953
- Oh, my God, me, me,
me, me, me. - Oh, my God,

09:12.986 --> 09:14.955
that was the craziest night
we've ever had.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.189
- But also the most important.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.191
- It cemented
our friendship forever.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.860
- Guys, I feel
the exact same way.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.361
- I know we made you do
a few things

09:21.394 --> 09:23.030
that made you uncomfortable.
- But you stuck it out.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.365
- And the significance of that
was not lost on us.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.767
- Yeah, I feel like
this conversation

09:26.800 --> 09:28.401
could probably happen
some other time.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.203
- Lucy, we love you.
And because of that night

09:30.237 --> 09:31.471
and, like, how long
you stayed...

09:31.504 --> 09:33.874
- Oh, for (bleep) sake.
- ...we always will.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.876
- Aw.
You guys, I love you too.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.311
- (squeals cheerfully)
- (giggles)

09:38.345 --> 09:39.546
- (whimpering)

09:39.579 --> 09:41.882
- Okay, I get it.
I'm sorry.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.416
I'm sorry I left early.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.385
But it's not a big deal.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.754
Mike doesn't hold grudges.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.789
(eerie string music)

10:08.942 --> 10:10.243
- Aah!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.012
(dramatic orchestral music)

10:30.798 --> 10:32.632
(ominous musical flourish)

10:32.666 --> 10:34.935
- All right, Nana,
there you are.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.337
You're all set.
- Joshie.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.339
Joshie, we may have
a teensy little issue.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.109
- What?
- Mike is finally here.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
But while we have
a seat for him,

10:44.177 --> 10:45.512
we don't have any
for his henchmen.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.147
- For his-his henchmen?
What?

10:47.180 --> 10:50.483
- (cackling)

10:50.517 --> 10:52.152
(sinister music)

10:52.185 --> 10:54.321
Okay, boys, it's showtime!

10:54.354 --> 10:56.356
- Go get him, boss.
- Yeah! Show him.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.624
- Who the (bleep)
are these guys?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.159
Mike, are you...
are you all right?

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
- Never better, Joshie boy.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.864
Sorry to crash
your little party.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.398
- Well, you didn't crash it.
You were invited.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.134
It's... You're the best man.
This is a wedding rehearsal.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.169
- (cackling)
- What are you...

11:09.202 --> 11:12.205
- Ah, champagne.
Don't mind if I...

11:12.239 --> 11:13.907
don't!

11:13.941 --> 11:15.876
That's kinda wasteful.
- (cackles)

11:15.909 --> 11:17.377
(screeching)

11:17.410 --> 11:19.880
- Can you please just calm down?
- Oh, I wish I could,

11:19.913 --> 11:21.081
but...
(sniffs)

11:21.114 --> 11:22.115
something's burning.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.320
(chuckles)
Toasts.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.825
- "A" is for "amour,"
which Josh and Lucy truly feel.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.493
"B" is for "belonging."

11:33.526 --> 11:36.029
- That's right.
As soon as Liz is done,

11:36.063 --> 11:38.832
my toast is gonna blow
this place sky high.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.201
- (laughs) Yeah.
Clock's ticking, idiot.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.503
- Who are you?
- "E" is for "embark."

11:43.536 --> 11:46.006
Their new journey has begun.
-I'm pretty sure our e-mail said

11:46.039 --> 11:48.241
we have to keep the speeches
between three and five minutes.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.511
- Length is the least of
your worries, Joshie boy.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.346
This card's about
your herpes scare.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.082
- Oh, my God.
- This card's about ISIS.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.583
- Why?
- This deck of cards

11:56.616 --> 11:58.752
is what can only be described
as wheelchair humor.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.187
(ominous musical flourish)

12:00.220 --> 12:02.055
- Mike, you're being
an asshole, okay?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.191
You're gonna ruin
my rehearsal dinner.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.860
- You ruined my bachelor party!
- I'm sorry I left, okay?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.428
But can you really blame me?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.463
Who the hell wants
to get blackout drunk

12:10.497 --> 12:12.365
at a shitty strip club?
- Well, you do,

12:12.399 --> 12:13.867
or at least you used to.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.870
- Yeah, used to!
Used to!

12:16.904 --> 12:19.039
I don't like doing
that shit anymore.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.874
- Yeah, or is it that you
just don't like me anymore?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.475
- Why are you so
hung up on this?

12:22.509 --> 12:23.977
It was just a party.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.213
- No, it wasn't
just a party, man.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.881
It was our last chance
to hang out,

12:27.915 --> 12:30.050
and you left without
even saying good-bye.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.885
- (sighs)
- And finally "Z."

12:31.919 --> 12:35.322
"Z" is for "Zarathustra,"

12:35.355 --> 12:37.457
which I think speaks for itself.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.059
(scattered applause)

12:39.092 --> 12:40.928
- Are there any other toasts?

12:40.961 --> 12:44.397
- Please...

12:44.431 --> 12:45.966
- Don't worry.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.801
I'm not gonna ruin
any more of your life.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.804
- I...
(sighs) Mike...

12:50.838 --> 12:54.842
Mike, can I talk to you
without your neon beatniks?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.309
Mike?

13:00.047 --> 13:02.782
- (sighs) Hi.
Mike, it's me, uh, again.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.618
I'm-I'm really,
really sorry, man.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.520
I mean it.
I'm-I'm sorry.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.122
Just please call me back,
please.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.791
(sighs)
- Hey.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.360
- Hi.
- Any luck?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.963
- Uh, no, no, I think
he's still pretty upset.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.865
- Well, you know what?
I'm sure he is,

13:17.898 --> 13:20.100
but just give him
some time, okay?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.502
He's gonna forgive you.
You're his best friend.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.972
(dramatic music)

13:25.005 --> 13:26.874
- MIKE:
After much consideration,

13:26.907 --> 13:29.977
I have decided to retire
as Josh's best friend.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
- Mike, how can you
just walk away?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.047
You're the greatest ever,
and you're still in your prime.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.282
- Had a great career,
you know,

13:35.315 --> 13:36.884
set a lot
of best friend records--

13:36.917 --> 13:38.318
most consecutive hangs,

13:38.351 --> 13:40.820
also grossest bare-ass fart
to Josh's face.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.990
It's one I believe
may never be broken.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.192
Uh, but there's more to life
than being Josh's best friend.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.160
Yeah, I want to spend time
with my family,

13:47.194 --> 13:49.162
explore some
business opportunities,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.965
and also pursue
my other lifelong dream.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.667
- What dream?
- To play professional baseball.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.169
(all gasping and murmuring)

13:56.203 --> 13:58.038
I am thrilled to announce
that I have just signed

13:58.071 --> 13:59.907
a minor league,
non-guaranteed contract

13:59.940 --> 14:01.641
with the Chattanooga Mud Dogs.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.144
With any luck, I will accomplish
just as much in baseball

14:04.177 --> 14:05.678
as I did being
Josh's best friend.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.014
Thank you.
ALL: Michael!

14:07.047 --> 14:09.016
- Thank you, Mikey.
-JOSH: What?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.650
- I didn't know
Mike played baseball.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.053
- I mean, he played softball
at middle school,

14:13.086 --> 14:14.754
and he was terrible.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.991
Okay, um...
Uh, Lucy, I know

14:18.025 --> 14:19.192
we still have, like,
wedding stuff to do, but...

14:19.226 --> 14:22.262
- Josh, Josh,
this is important, okay?

14:22.295 --> 14:25.198
(bright acoustic guitar music)

14:25.232 --> 14:28.068
Go to Chattanooga.
- (whispers) Yeah.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.836
(both sigh)

14:29.869 --> 14:32.072
- I love you!

14:32.105 --> 14:34.107
*

14:47.254 --> 14:49.856
- Okay, hustle up, y'all!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.224
Let's practice.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.393
Practice makes perfect,
right?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.595
Ah, love me some drills,
right, baby?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.430
(pastoral music)

14:57.464 --> 14:59.632
Doing a no-hitter today,
right?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.701
Come on, come on.
Hit me! Come on.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.536
Come on. Aah!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.438
(groans)

15:05.472 --> 15:08.308
- Mike! Mike!
Can you sign this?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.310
- Sure, kid, what do you got?
A baseball poster?

15:10.343 --> 15:13.113
- Nah, it's from your old days
as Josh's best friend.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.581
- That was a good year.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.617
Sorry, kid,
I don't do that anymore.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.253
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to do batting.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.426
All right, Guerrero,
don't hold back!

15:26.459 --> 15:28.295
(grunts)
(clapping)

15:28.328 --> 15:30.730
- Yeah, nice--nice swing.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.067
- What do you want?
- Just want to apologize, man.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.803
- Nothing to be sorry for, man.
It's better this way.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.572
We're both doing exactly
what we were born to do.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.176
You're marrying Lucy,
and I'm playing baseball.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.079
-MAN: Oh!

15:46.113 --> 15:47.680
- Uh, I've probably done
enough batting.

15:49.516 --> 15:53.353
- Mike, I-I totally
believe you have

15:53.386 --> 15:56.123
exactly what it takes to be
a professional baseball player.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.992
- Obviously.
- But I need you on my team.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.694
- Dude, you don't, okay?
You're a full grown-up now.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.863
It's like I don't even know
how to be your friend anymore.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.498
*

16:05.532 --> 16:08.368
- Hey, you remember-
remember freshman year

16:08.401 --> 16:12.272
when you and I would each pound,
like, 12 beers a night?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.341
- Yeah, that was great.
- It-it was.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.775
Uh, and then I was like,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.444
"I don't think
I can do this anymore.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.479
I'm literally gonna die
from alcohol poisoning."

16:19.512 --> 16:22.715
It was the end of an era,
but it wasn't the end of us.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.652
Why? Because you
came up with the idea

16:25.685 --> 16:28.655
of smoking pot every day.
- That's right.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.058
God, it was hard
at first. Scary.

16:31.091 --> 16:35.028
- But we stuck with it,
and we eventually leveled out.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.631
And-and if we can go through
a huge change like that,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.501
what can't we deal with?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.204
- You came all the way
to Chattanooga to tell me that?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.572
- Yup.
- Wait.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.508
Aren't you worried
about missing the wedding?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.443
- No wedding
without my best man.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.550
- Well, Coach,
it's been a crazy ride.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.019
It's no secret we didn't
always see eye to eye,

17:00.053 --> 17:02.389
but even though I'm leaving
the clubhouse today

17:02.422 --> 17:04.557
and I won't be there
for the doubleheader

17:04.591 --> 17:07.160
against the Water Bears
and the Sky Grizzlies,

17:07.194 --> 17:10.397
I want you to know I will always
consider Chattanooga my home,

17:10.430 --> 17:14.401
and I will always,
always bleed Mud Dog blue.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.237
So I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

17:17.270 --> 17:18.571
- You're out.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.107
(indistinct chatter)

17:20.140 --> 17:22.075
BOTH: Hey!

17:22.109 --> 17:24.177
(both laughing)
- Ah, they're gonna miss me.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.412
- Yeah, for sure.
I know I do.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.580
- Yeah, hey,
I miss you too, buddy.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.682
-MAN:
Oh! The same spot!

17:29.716 --> 17:31.584
- Yeah.

17:31.618 --> 17:35.422
(bright acoustic guitar music)

17:35.455 --> 17:37.023
Pound it.
(laughs)

17:37.056 --> 17:38.625
- Wow, cool,
there's a poster of us?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.627
- Yeah, man.
You want one?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.429
- I'd love one.
- Hey, you know,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.631
I'm making a movie
with Bugs Bunny...

17:48.301 --> 17:51.070
- Uh, okay, excellent.
So Tom will be there,

17:51.104 --> 17:53.440
Liz will be there,
and then, uh, the best man,

17:53.473 --> 17:57.410
my best man, will be
on that spot right there.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.246
- Uh, w-what if
I don't hit my spot?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.913
Does it have to be exact or...
- Nah.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.549
Just kinda know
your general area.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.417
- Right, right,
right, got you.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.286
- Uh, and then the music begins,
you'll walk down the aisle

18:06.319 --> 18:07.787
at a slightly
slower-than-normal pace.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.056
- Okay, like this?
- Eh, no.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.791
No, no. Slow-slower
than normal--

18:11.824 --> 18:13.993
um, deliberate.
- Ah, shit, bro,

18:14.026 --> 18:16.062
what if I blow it?
- Mike, you're gonna do great.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.797
- (sighs)
- Here, take my arm...

18:17.830 --> 18:19.432
- Okay.
- We'll do it together.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.501
(gentle acoustic guitar music)
BOTH: Hm.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.002
- * Ooh *

18:23.035 --> 18:24.070
- Hey, I've been
meaning to ask you,

18:24.103 --> 18:25.405
when did Nikhil get shot?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.639
- Oh, I never told you
that story?

18:26.673 --> 18:27.940
- No!
- Okay.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.776
- So last month
in Caracas...

18:29.809 --> 18:33.346
* - I saw a name
in the graveyard that I knew *

18:33.380 --> 18:37.250
* Glowing like the neon
in a lounge light *

18:37.284 --> 18:40.620
* I picked away all
the gray hairs that I'd grown *

18:40.653 --> 18:43.623
* That remained
on the outside *

18:45.358 --> 18:49.262
* And I'm wound tight *

18:49.296 --> 18:53.032
* And bound by
the secrets you saved *

18:53.065 --> 18:55.134
* The pieces you kept *

18:55.168 --> 18:58.037
* They've risen and slept
without you *

19:09.382 --> 19:11.384
