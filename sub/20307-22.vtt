WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:05.088
All right, everybody,
listen up, listen up!

00:05.171 --> 00:09.009
Item one is what you've already
heard on the news media.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.428
We finally got a make on the Creeper.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.680
(cheering)

00:13.763 --> 00:15.849
He's this maniac that's been on a rampage.

00:15.932 --> 00:19.352
He's a suspect in at least nine murders
both here and upstate,

00:19.436 --> 00:23.565
in addition to sexual assaults
and God knows what else.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.776
Now, late last night,
the state police forensics

00:26.860 --> 00:31.322
managed to lift a print
from this guy's last appearance upstate.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.659
From that,
they managed to make a positive ID.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.996
The guy's a jailrat,
name of Albert Sawyer,

00:38.079 --> 00:40.915
Male, Cauc., 5'8'' and 140.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.209
There's a full description
in your hot sheets.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.502
There's also a mug shot.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.923
Now, this same photo
is gonna be plastered in all the papers

00:49.007 --> 00:51.217
as well as on all of the news programs.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.846
So this might be the break
that's gonna flush this guy out.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.514
(indistinct chatter)

00:56.598 --> 00:59.601
On the other hand, this kind of exposure

00:59.684 --> 01:03.688
also buys a huge increase
in false sightings,

01:03.772 --> 01:07.650
and it ups the risk of copycat incidents,
and we also pay a price,

01:07.734 --> 01:10.236
which I don't have to tell
all of the tour patrols,

01:10.779 --> 01:12.781
in general community anxiety.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.032
General anxiety,

01:14.115 --> 01:17.994
that means when everyone in the city
sleeps with a piece under his pillow.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.413
Yeah, that's what it means, John.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.333
And it also means
that I'm gonna have to pull

01:23.416 --> 01:26.503
Tenelli and Galvin off street patrol

01:26.586 --> 01:29.255
because the department's commandeering
two uniforms

01:29.339 --> 01:32.467
from every precinct
for temporary assignment to their,

01:32.550 --> 01:35.887
to their domestic security
evaluation program.

01:35.970 --> 01:40.141
It also means that every poor slob
who forgets his door key

01:40.225 --> 01:42.519
or who is selling brushes door to door

01:42.602 --> 01:46.064
-runs a good chance of getting whacked.
-Especially if he's white and five-eight.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.484
Now, if this maniac is Upstate,
I hope they catch him up there.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.736
I don't care
if they catch him in Timbuktu.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.950
But if Mr. Albert Sawyer
is on our streets,

01:57.492 --> 01:59.077
I don't want us to miss him.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.750
I want him caught... today.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.797
(suspenseful music playing)

02:16.094 --> 02:19.389
-MAN: Hey, over here.
-MAN 2: Hey, how you doing?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.397
(action music plays)

03:10.064 --> 03:12.525
(videogame sounds)

03:12.609 --> 03:14.527
(action music continues)

03:14.611 --> 03:17.113
(indistinct chatter)

03:31.085 --> 03:33.004
(dramatic music)

03:39.385 --> 03:41.596
(action music continues)

04:13.461 --> 04:16.714
(speaking Spanish)

04:34.232 --> 04:35.233
Get out of here!

04:36.192 --> 04:37.819
(engine sputtering)

04:40.822 --> 04:42.073
Get out! No!

04:42.156 --> 04:43.491
Get outta here!

04:43.574 --> 04:49.205
(woman shouting in Spanish)

04:59.882 --> 05:01.509
(yelling)

05:13.438 --> 05:17.275
DISPATCH: <i>All units,</i>
<i>attempted 213, Melton and Hillside.</i>

05:17.358 --> 05:20.361
<i>Suspect is said to match</i>
<i>description of Albert Sawyer.</i>

05:20.445 --> 05:23.364
<i>Subject of APB</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:26.743
-(siren wailing)
-2202, 5th and Broad responding.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.077
Acknowledge. 2203.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.040
(siren wailing)

05:32.123 --> 05:35.043
(indistinct shouting)

05:35.126 --> 05:38.004
-(grunts)
-Hey, man!

05:38.087 --> 05:41.716
(yelling in Spanish)

05:45.345 --> 05:49.265
(yelling in Spanish)

06:11.496 --> 06:13.456
(tires screech)

06:13.539 --> 06:15.375
(mob yelling)

06:17.919 --> 06:19.337
MAN: Get him off of there!

06:19.420 --> 06:21.422
(sirens wailing)

06:23.716 --> 06:25.009
(tires screech)

06:30.223 --> 06:32.308
All right! Police officer!

06:33.559 --> 06:35.520
Put that gun away! Put it away!

06:35.603 --> 06:37.397
RENKO: Get out of my way!
I gotta go in here!

06:37.480 --> 06:38.940
Stand back! You all stand back!

06:39.023 --> 06:41.776
-Get back!
-Get off of him! Get off of him!

06:42.360 --> 06:43.569
Let's look at this.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.739
All right, now,
I don't want nobody touching me.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.324
Nobody touching anybody here now.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.035
Come on! Get back! Come on! Get back!

06:51.119 --> 06:52.161
Come on!

06:53.496 --> 06:55.915
-Get him in the car.
-I mean it! You stay away from this car!

06:55.998 --> 06:58.292
-(siren wailing)
-Stay away from this car.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.671
(racket)

07:01.754 --> 07:04.924
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
an attorney will be appointed for you

07:05.007 --> 07:07.385
without charge.
You understand these specific rights

07:07.468 --> 07:08.636
-as I give 'em to you?
-Yeah.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.471
You think we oughta get him to a hospital?

07:10.555 --> 07:11.472
They want to kill me.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.225
(siren wails)

07:14.308 --> 07:16.436
We got him! We got him!

07:16.519 --> 07:17.478
What's your name?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.857
I'm who everyone's looking for.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.111
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:27.280
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

07:27.363 --> 07:31.325
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

07:31.409 --> 07:32.743

08:39.143 --> 08:41.187
(cheerful music playing)

08:41.270 --> 08:43.272
(siren wailing)

09:39.328 --> 09:41.038
Okay. Make way. Come on now.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.416
Let them through, people.
Let them through. Make way.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.584
(racket)

09:44.667 --> 09:46.544
Was it the cops
or the civilians who beat him?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.213
Do you feel sorry for your victims?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.924
-Did he get Miranda?
-Yes, sir.

09:52.008 --> 09:52.842
Give us anything?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.094
Well, sir, he says
he's the one we're looking for.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.637
REPORTER: Chief. Chief Daniels.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.764
-Stan?
-Chief Daniels.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.683
Composite hit him right
on the button, huh?

10:00.766 --> 10:03.144
We have to set up
a temporary press room down in roll call.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.979
We have to keep these reporters down there

10:05.062 --> 10:06.606
while we bring in witnesses
for the lineup.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.275
-Real three-ring job, huh?
-Frank, your office.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.111
Stan, I'm gonna work squad room
the rest of the shift,

10:12.194 --> 10:14.113
-help out with logistics.
-Good going, Luce.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.949
Melvin, make sure all those media people
have press passes,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.743
which should be checked downstairs.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.538
RENKO: I see. So police
are eligible for the reward money

10:22.622 --> 10:24.248
for the capture of this Creeper fella.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.293
Yes, I know. I realize I'm only talking
to the Chamber of Commerce, sir,

10:27.376 --> 10:30.379
but, uh,
yes, I do realize that other organizations

10:30.463 --> 10:32.298
are also contributing money to this fund.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.507
Yes, sir.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.552
I'd be glad to talk to you some more,
but I'm gonna have to get back to you.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.387
I will, I assure you, real soon.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.640
You've got an arrest report
to file, Andrew.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.976
Yes, Sergeant, I do.
Yes, police are eligible.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.936
-I heard the conversation.
-Wanna get a guess

10:46.020 --> 10:47.855
what this guy gave me
as to how much money is in that?

10:47.938 --> 10:50.691
Renko, there are gonna be other people
up for that money besides--

10:50.775 --> 10:53.444
One quarter of a million dollars.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.487
Are you serious?

10:54.570 --> 10:56.822
So, worse case,
we only get half of it, right?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.991
That's 62.5 each.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.744
Renko, you're gonna get a heart
attack before you spend one--

11:01.827 --> 11:04.080
Guys, how about some pictures right here?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.957
Pictures. You, you, you, come over here.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.918
You have your picture made, okay?

11:09.585 --> 11:11.420
Stand right up here against the wall here.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.922
Like this here. Take it.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.757
Hell of a thing for us, huh, Frank?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.635
I was afraid they were gonna
capture him up north.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.763
-They think he'd just come off a bus.
-So how are we handling it?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.973
He's being booked.
We'll arraign this afternoon.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.767
I mean the media.
Where we having the press conference?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.228
We're checking
the credentials in roll call.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.813
Great. We'll do it down there.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.399
I understand the good folks
in the neighborhood

11:31.482 --> 11:33.859
roughed Mr. Sawyer up a bit
before our uniforms arrived.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
He's suspect in four murders in that area.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.154
I'm trying to remember

11:37.238 --> 11:39.699
why it would've been a bad thing
if they'd finished him off.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.993
Now, let's see,
for the people at the podium,

11:43.077 --> 11:44.912
I want the cops who made the bust,

11:44.995 --> 11:47.164
the civilians
who were involved in the capture--

11:47.915 --> 11:50.042
Of course, you, Frank,
standing right beside me.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.002
Hill and Renko
were the arresting officers.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.046
Good. We'll collect them on the way down.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.801
Once in a while, it all
comes up sevens, hey, my friend?

11:58.884 --> 12:01.345
We're gonna make every damn edition.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.142
-Joyce.
-Hi, Irwin.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.644
-Did you draw Sawyer?
-At least through intake.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.771
I can't believe the guy's file.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.024
Just for openers, we're charging
in three rapes, two ADWs,

12:14.108 --> 12:17.570
two B&amp;Es, a kidnap, and four counts
of murder, special circumstances.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.655
Wait till you hear
from the outlying districts.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.948
Have you seen him yet?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.617
-Just going in.
-Ask him if he knows any good therapists.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.203
Ms. Davenport, interrogation A.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.046
Would you wait right outside the door?

12:41.719 --> 12:42.636
(door closes)

12:42.720 --> 12:45.264
My name's Joyce Davenport, Mr. Sawyer.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.600
I've been assigned to represent you

12:47.683 --> 12:50.311
if you don't have the means
to hire a private attorney.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.437
Right.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.064
Have you made a statement to the police?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.234
I know what to do.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.031
Did you receive any of those injuries
after you were arrested?

13:03.073 --> 13:04.408
You tell me.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.662
They're going to be taking you
to a lineup any second.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.831
Tell me if you were hurt

13:10.915 --> 13:12.792
while you were being captured
or afterward.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
It was the people in the street.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.381
Do you know
what takes place during a lineup?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.675
-I understand.
-There are going to be people,

13:21.759 --> 13:24.678
victims in the crimes you're suspected of,
who will try to identify--

13:24.762 --> 13:26.096
I said I understand.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.727
Look, you're making me afraid,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.979
and I don't want to have
to have a guard in here.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.526
And I don't want to have
to conduct a defense that way.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.862
But if you're trying to frighten me,
I want you to stop it.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.075
I ain't trying to frighten you.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.704
All right. I'm sorry.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.457
Let's go on. Uh?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.751
(telephone ringing)

13:55.835 --> 13:57.294
Belker.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.337
Hi.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.007
What do you mean?

14:04.468 --> 14:06.095
I don't know what that means, Robin.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.556
Either it is time or it isn't time.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.143
I'm coming home. Don't go anywhere.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.228
I love you.

14:15.896 --> 14:20.776
(indistinct chatter)

14:28.993 --> 14:31.328
You people aren't gonna find out
anything more up here.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.289
Now, go downstairs
to the press conference.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.583
-Personal time, Sarge.
-Yeah.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.877
Hey, uh, Mick, is it the baby? Is this it?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
I don't know! Maybe!

14:40.004 --> 14:42.673
(loud overlapping chatter)

14:46.010 --> 14:48.345
WOMAN: Chief, why did you decide

14:48.429 --> 14:50.472
to go public
with the Creeper's picture, Chief?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.683
Was it because the police
weren't getting anywhere on their own?

14:52.766 --> 14:56.437
I have been proud of law enforcement
in our department and throughout the state

14:56.520 --> 14:58.397
since this nightmare
began three weeks ago.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.400
The simple fact is
that given the high degree

15:01.483 --> 15:04.737
of public awareness and concern
about the so-called Creeper's activities,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.239
by circulating his picture,
we were able, in effect,

15:07.323 --> 15:09.700
to deputize
the entire community to assist us.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.286
That kind of cooperation
is always desirable.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.663
(clamoring)

15:14.747 --> 15:16.373
The community did more
than just assist you.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.001
We understand
that they actually caught the guy.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.463
You are not going to sell
police-civilian relations

15:22.546 --> 15:25.674
in the capture of Mr. Sawyer
as having been adversarial, gentlemen.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.010
The fact is,
we are deeply indebted and grateful

15:28.093 --> 15:31.680
to individuals like Mr. Sanchez here

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140
for their preliminary work

15:33.682 --> 15:35.601
in bringing the so-called Creeper to bay.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.270
Congratulations, Manolo.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.523
Thank you very much. You know, I'd like
to become a police officer myself.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.651
Oh. You'd make a fine one.
Why don't you apply?

15:43.734 --> 15:44.735
You mean that?

15:45.527 --> 15:48.864
Absolutely. You've demonstrated
your bravery and your public spiritedness.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.201
And those are the very qualifications
the department is looking for.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.494
I'm a Vietnam veteran, sir.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.412
-That'd help, right?
-Yes.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.873
Because I've been on unemployment
for the last 19 weeks,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.959
and besides reward money,
I could use this job.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.002
Mr. Sanchez, you fill out an application,

16:02.086 --> 16:03.420
and I will see to it personally.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.256
-I'd also like to thank--
-God bless you, Chief. God bless you.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.842
It's a great day for us all.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.638
God bless this country!
The hell with the Creeper!

16:12.721 --> 16:15.057
(applause, cheering)

16:16.183 --> 16:18.519
-MAN: Couple more questions--
-MAN 2: Chief Daniels--

16:18.602 --> 16:22.231
(clamoring)

16:24.692 --> 16:26.235
(tires screeching)

16:30.114 --> 16:32.032
(engine revs)

16:33.951 --> 16:35.202
(tires screech)

16:40.082 --> 16:41.333
-(horns honk)
-Is this it?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.961
-This is it.
-This is it. Alright.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.547
MAN (honks the horn):
Hey, move your car! I wanna get to work!

16:46.630 --> 16:50.175
(honking continues)

17:02.646 --> 17:03.772
All right!

17:03.856 --> 17:06.108
(honking continues)

17:08.318 --> 17:10.362
Let's go! Come on, man!

17:11.321 --> 17:12.614
Move your car!

17:17.745 --> 17:19.246
(engine starts)

17:21.540 --> 17:23.375
-(engine revs)
-(tires screech)

17:33.093 --> 17:35.387
WOMAN (shudders): Number three.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.849
I think that's the one.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.727
Can you say definitely?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.691
Yes. Number three.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.278
Thank you, Mrs. Prince.
That's all we need.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.450
Congratulations. You picked the suspect.

17:57.868 --> 17:58.911
That was him?

17:59.369 --> 18:00.871
That's him, number three.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.383
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.718
Finished with intake?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.598
I suppose it was routine.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.062
But his eyes,
the way he looked at me, Frank,

18:25.813 --> 18:27.231
I was terrified.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.067
He's not exactly
your run-of-the-mill defendant.

18:30.150 --> 18:34.696
Sawyer deserves a lawyer who's not
too frightened to give him a defense.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.740
Different lawyers
are right for different clients.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.450
You think I should withdraw?

18:38.534 --> 18:41.245
It's pretty obvious
this one's way beyond the call of duty.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.747
Capital case, automatic appellate review.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.374
Could be
three or four years out of your life.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.920
It was just the first intake.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.590
I saw a replay
of your press conference, Furillo.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.759
You think I talked too much?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.094
(laughs)

18:57.845 --> 18:59.721
-(telephone ringing)
-How you doing, Stan?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.516
Who ordered that stuff?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.268
I knew you'd have a mob scene here,

19:04.351 --> 19:06.770
so I figured, hey, people gotta eat.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.314
I got crullers here.
I got three different kinds of Danish.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.316
And Manuel's right behind me
with the coffee.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.819
Jerry, I appreciate the thought,
but it's only gonna make

19:13.902 --> 19:15.946
-for more crowd control.
-Got any sandwiches?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.948
Sandwiches? Yeah.
They should be along around noon.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.575
This food is not for the uniforms.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.620
It's for the press downstairs.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.124
-You know where roll call is?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.250
You got it, Stan.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.546
Stan, uh,
any chance of getting a look at him?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.674
-Who?
-Abraham Lincoln.

19:35.757 --> 19:36.884
(laughs) Who do you think?

19:36.967 --> 19:39.178
The Creeper.
Where is he, in a cell downstairs?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.346
Jerry, please, I got my hands full today.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.098
Forget I asked, all right?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.601
Hey, great score for you guys, huh, Norm?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.686
-The Emperor Wacko.
-What do you want?

19:47.769 --> 19:50.314
I got some stuff that might be
in the background music,

19:50.397 --> 19:53.525
some items that may be connected
to this creep.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.736
The minute I was approached,
I hurried over.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.363
-What kind of items?
-Oh, watches, jewelry.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.200
This chick's been fencing
his stuff all along.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.785
You knew this before
and you didn't get it to us?

20:03.869 --> 20:06.830
No, I didn't know.
She just told me the story.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.584
How'd you leave it with her?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.211
Made a meet for a couple of hours.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.754
She's bringing the pieces?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.631
Correct.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.841
I got to get a warrant.
You'll be wearing a wire.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.218
Yeah.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.386
Look, Sid, don't get
all hurt on me now, all right?

20:21.470 --> 20:24.097
-I didn't mean to wound your feelings.
-Well, I mean,

20:24.181 --> 20:25.474
I'm a human being, too, Norm.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.435
You think I would know about a guy
like this without giving him up?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.686
Forget that he's a monster.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.648
Off the reward money,
I could retire to Ft. Lauderdale.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.567
Mr. Lopez, I have your name,
and I have your account of the incident.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.653
-What you gonna do about it?
-Put it in my report.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.154
Yeah? Wait, I want to see.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.573
-Meaning what?
-You're up for a taste

20:41.657 --> 20:43.867
of that reward yourself.
How do I know what you putting in there?

20:43.951 --> 20:46.703
You know, you're lucky you're standing
in a police station, pal--

20:47.371 --> 20:50.874
You filed a job application,
and I've got your name in my report.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.752
-So would you now please just leave?
-Both of you go home.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.462
You got it was me that hit him
with the baseball bat?

20:55.545 --> 20:57.631
-I got it.
-Because that's what slowed him down.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.258
Don't worry about slowing him down.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.927
These guys ain't giving up
ten cents of that reward money.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.721
You know what? This is the second time
you have called me a thief,

21:04.805 --> 21:07.641
so I strongly suggest
that you <i>ándale</i> out of here

21:07.724 --> 21:09.601
before I refry your beans, boy.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.396
-Come on, Paco.
-Get out of here, Paquito.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.024
You're a <i>ladrón,</i> man.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.278
You imagine the stones on that guy,
trying to think I'm gonna ace him--

21:19.361 --> 21:21.238
-You spell his name right?
-I spelled his name right.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.614
I don't like your tone of voice, neither.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.996
-Mr. Sanchez?
-Yeah?

21:29.079 --> 21:30.831
Uh, could you come here a second, please?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.796
On this application form that you filed,

21:37.879 --> 21:38.880
my eyes are going,

21:38.964 --> 21:42.175
is that a three or an eight
in your Social Security number?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.428
-Three.
-Oh, and this here,

21:44.511 --> 21:46.179
you didn't fill in this block.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.098
"Have you ever been convicted
of a felony?"

21:48.682 --> 21:50.183
He told me to leave that blank.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.311
-Who was that?
-The police chief.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.814
I was convicted, see,
but it was a long time ago.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.317
-It was when I was just a kid.
-This was a juvenile offense?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.902
I robbed a store,
and I did a two-year bit when I was 20.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.363
Now, look, the police chief
said I was gonna get this job.

22:03.447 --> 22:08.118
Um, Mr. Sanchez, I think that the, uh,

22:08.201 --> 22:10.662
I think the department has regs
on accepting an applicant

22:10.746 --> 22:12.247
who has a felony jacket.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.334
PACO: You hear that, bro? That's
how they gonna do everything, man.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.253
-Get the chief on the phone.
-I'm gonna file the application.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.340
-I'm just telling you about policy.
-Yeah, you just put it through, man.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.632
I'm gonna to the police chief

22:22.716 --> 22:24.718
because he said he was gonna handle
this for me!

22:27.095 --> 22:28.555
(pants)

22:28.638 --> 22:29.681
(moans)

22:31.767 --> 22:33.560
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.270
(panting)

22:37.314 --> 22:39.024
-(moans)
-Take it easy.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.110
-Nurse!
-No, Mick!

22:42.194 --> 22:43.987
This woman is in terrible pain!

22:44.071 --> 22:47.199
-I'm all right.
-You're in pain! Nobody comes!

22:47.282 --> 22:48.658
Mick, will you take a break?

22:49.785 --> 22:53.330
No. I want to stay here and help you.

22:53.413 --> 22:57.125
No, no, I'm not even two centimeters yet.
There's nothing to do.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.669
Just go. Go ahead. Take a walk. (sighs)

22:59.753 --> 23:00.712
All right. You sure?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.924
Yeah. Honestly.
I think I'll try to take a nap.

23:07.719 --> 23:08.720
All right.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.181
-I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
-Okay.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.974
-You're all right? All right.
-Yeah.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.526
(siren wailing)

23:22.609 --> 23:25.237
WOMAN (over radio):
<i>If this stuff came to me any other way,</i>

23:25.320 --> 23:27.781
<i>I'd be asking for five figures.</i>

23:29.241 --> 23:32.244
Yeah, but are we sure
it's all from the Creeper?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.996
He put it from his hand to mine.

23:37.791 --> 23:42.129
Sometimes, I would touch,
like, a brooch or something...

23:43.922 --> 23:45.924
(voice trembling) and I hear the voices...

23:46.550 --> 23:47.717
screaming.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.846
You should see a doctor about that, Alice.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.099
He made me fence for him, Sid.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.145
I was too afraid to tell him no.

23:58.937 --> 24:02.107
He was basing all the time. He was crazy.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.526
I mean, sometimes, I'd give him money

24:05.610 --> 24:08.113
even when he didn't have anything to sell.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.700
That's how bad he scared me.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.954
SID: <i>You gotta put</i>
<i>this guy on scholarship.</i>

24:16.037 --> 24:18.498
ALICE: <i>You want to know</i>
<i>why I was so scared to do anything?</i>

24:19.374 --> 24:22.169
You want me to tell you
some of the things he did?

24:25.547 --> 24:26.465
Yeah.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.592
I ask him once,

24:29.676 --> 24:33.054
I said, "Hey, what are you smiling for?"

24:34.723 --> 24:36.892
He said, "Hey, Alice,

24:37.851 --> 24:39.394
everything comes off."

24:42.397 --> 24:43.690
I didn't know.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.819
(voice breaking)
I thought he was asking me to strip.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.157
He said he...

24:53.366 --> 24:57.579
He said he tore this woman's
face off with his own hands.

24:58.622 --> 25:02.375
(sobbing) He said he tore out her tongue.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.544
(crying)

25:04.628 --> 25:06.755
"Everything comes off, Alice."

25:06.838 --> 25:09.424
(sobbing) Oh, God!

25:10.300 --> 25:12.385
(sobbing) <i>Oh, my God!</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:16.598
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.725
Okay.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.394
Well, you want this or not?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.730
It's $1,200.

25:24.940 --> 25:25.941
Yeah.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.152
Let's do business.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.503
Ms. Davenport?

25:47.045 --> 25:49.089
-What is it? What's wrong with him?
-Herb Elman.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.466
You said you had urgent news
about my brother.

25:51.550 --> 25:55.220
Well, I'm afraid I stretched
the bounds of veracity a bit there.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.889
I wanted a chance at you
away from that zoo.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.099
Wait a minute--

25:59.182 --> 26:01.935
Joyce, did you follow
the Larry Larson case?

26:02.018 --> 26:03.270
This isn't about my brother--

26:03.353 --> 26:06.773
There were 51 other executions
in this country in the last nine years.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.401
Did you ever wonder
why Larson got more exposure

26:09.484 --> 26:11.528
than all the rest of them put together?

26:11.611 --> 26:12.445
You listen to me--

26:12.529 --> 26:15.365
I made over $200,000 for Larry Larson

26:15.448 --> 26:17.659
and the heirs to his estate,
Joyce, and believe me,

26:17.742 --> 26:19.494
if I'd been Larry's lawyer's agent

26:19.578 --> 26:22.330
and he'd been as beautiful
as you are, well-- (chuckles)

26:22.414 --> 26:25.917
-That figure might have had--
-Even if you wind up attaching yourself

26:26.001 --> 26:27.586
to one of the principals in this case,

26:27.669 --> 26:30.130
you and I have had our last conversation.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.507
-Would you at least take my card?
-Go to hell.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.727
-MAN: You holding, Ardis?
-MAN 2: You got 40 bucks?

26:43.810 --> 26:47.272
-(paper rustling)
-MAN: How's this look?

26:47.355 --> 26:50.066
ARDIS: Like Andrew Jackson
and the Hamilton brothers.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.235
-All right.
-Bye, boys.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.451
How long?

26:59.951 --> 27:01.911
Five minutes, man. Wait in the lobby.

27:03.997 --> 27:07.208
-WOMAN: (speaking over PA)
-(phones ringing)

27:28.897 --> 27:30.023
Hospital security, sir.

27:30.106 --> 27:32.275
All right, you want to take
your hands off me?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.736
You're in a narcotics
dispensation area, pal.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.489
-I'm gonna have to search your pockets.
-What's going on, Tony?

27:37.572 --> 27:40.742
Search his pockets. I bet
you'll find 40 bucks' worth of drugs.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.952
-Say what?
-You'd better come with me, too, Ardis.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.954
-Let's straighten this out.
-Hey, look. No.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.623
The only thing
you're gonna find in my pockets is

27:46.706 --> 27:48.958
$40 worth of concert tickets!

27:52.796 --> 27:55.131
Let's go inside there
and straighten this out.

28:05.892 --> 28:09.813
If Laidlaw from the <i>Times</i> calls,
tell him I'll be back at 2:30.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.565
We can talk about politics,
the Creeper, whatever he wants.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.733
What about the mayor?

28:14.401 --> 28:15.443
I'm late.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.737
Tell him I had a nooner.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.656
Hey, Chief!

28:19.739 --> 28:21.825
-Mr. Sanchez.
-They're giving me a runaround

28:21.908 --> 28:24.369
-about my police application.
-Did you fill out the forms?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.538
Yeah, but they say that thing
about a conviction.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.749
Hey, Chief, can you just give me
a second, all right?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.710
I didn't know you had
a record, Mr. Sanchez.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.837
That was another life back then, Chief.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.381
-Now, you promised you'd help me!
-I'm not God.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.550
We do have application requirements.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.010
So how come they let
liars and promisers in, huh?

28:41.094 --> 28:43.930
I caught your Creeper, didn't I?
Me and my wife, we risked our lives!

28:44.013 --> 28:45.515
For which you have our gratitude.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.893
There's my gratitude!
You want my gratitude?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.812
-(thud)
-Let's handle this carefully.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.273
That's it, huh? This is it?
This is what I get?

28:58.153 --> 29:00.405
I'm very sorry for the misunderstanding.

29:00.488 --> 29:04.451
I have been authorized
to that area for 11 years!

29:04.534 --> 29:07.871
I misunderstood your conversation
in the men's room. I said I'm sorry.

29:07.954 --> 29:11.082
Mr. Belker's wife is expecting, gentlemen.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.709
He's under considerable stress.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.587
Then why don't you get him back
on the maternity floor!

29:15.670 --> 29:17.130
Well, if you're done with him,

29:17.213 --> 29:19.132
I think that's exactly
what we'd like to do.

29:19.632 --> 29:20.592
No problem here.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.510
All right. Enjoy the concert.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.054
I hope your baby takes after its mama.

29:25.138 --> 29:28.016
(growls)

29:31.436 --> 29:34.063
Don't feel too badly, Detective. (sighs)

29:34.147 --> 29:36.107
This sort of behavior
isn't all that uncommon

29:36.191 --> 29:37.400
in expectant fathers.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.278
We call it paternal parturition psychosis.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.781
I'm a cop. I thought
they were making a drug deal.

29:42.864 --> 29:47.035
The syndrome can manifest
as skin irritation, hives, eczema,

29:47.118 --> 29:49.204
in addition to the delusional episodes.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.830
This was not delusional.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.166
Uh, my mistake.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.005
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you growl like that all the time, too.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.807
-Stan?
-Captain.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.643
-How are you holding up?
-I'll make it.

30:11.726 --> 30:14.854
You know, this sort of thing
brings out every angle guy

30:14.938 --> 30:16.481
and bing-bong in a forest.

30:17.524 --> 30:21.194
I hear they're setting up special holding
for Sawyer on Michigan Avenue.

30:21.277 --> 30:24.614
Well, I don't care where they put him,
Captain, so long as it ain't here.

30:25.281 --> 30:28.409
Well, Raymond said 3:00.
After that, he's out of our hands.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.953
Tick-tock.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.000
Want a ride to arraignment?

30:36.084 --> 30:37.710
Half an hour?

30:37.794 --> 30:41.256
Sorry about the excited-law-student
routine this morning, I...

30:41.339 --> 30:44.342
I mean, from where you're sitting,
it's a different kind of experience.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.678
-It's who's sitting next to me.
-What's he like?

30:47.303 --> 30:50.056
I don't think I formed
any rational impressions.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.268
I was reacting so strongly
to my own feelings.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.771
Filing change of representation
re: Albert Sawyer. Thank you.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.606
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.149
Mr. Sawyer?

31:00.233 --> 31:03.361
We decided to change. No offense to you.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.113
Your son's agreed to this?

31:05.196 --> 31:06.865
Was this young lady Albert's lawyer?

31:06.948 --> 31:07.991
This is her.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.952
Marty Dignan, Ms. Davenport.
A pleasure to know you.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.789
-How do you know my name?
-Don't underestimate your celebrity.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.249
In certain circles, we hear a lot

31:16.332 --> 31:18.543
about a brilliant, enabled public defender
up in these parts.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.003
Getting a little deep in here.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.963
Who's married to a precinct captain.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.549
If you want to recommend

31:24.632 --> 31:26.593
that your son change lawyers,
that's your prerogative,

31:26.676 --> 31:30.096
but if Mr. Dignan has suggested
to either of you

31:30.179 --> 31:33.933
that I'll provide anything less
than full and satisfactory representation

31:34.017 --> 31:35.602
because I'm married to someone in--

31:35.685 --> 31:39.814
That's just one of a whole array of facts
I've asked Mr. Sawyer to consider.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.567
You don't really want to stay on
this thing, hm?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.694
I think I'd like to talk to my client.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.117
Sir, how can you include people

31:51.200 --> 31:53.411
who contributed to the composite drawing?

31:53.494 --> 31:56.998
Doesn't that seem like a little too much
right there? That's 20 extra people.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.834
Well, how long's that gonna take?

32:00.418 --> 32:01.753
Yeah, well, can I suggest to you

32:01.836 --> 32:04.422
that your distinguished
citizens-advisory commission

32:04.505 --> 32:07.425
somehow concentrate on the people

32:07.508 --> 32:10.345
who actually made the capture,
whoever those cops were?

32:11.429 --> 32:12.889
Uh-huh. I understand.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.099
-(hangs up)
-Thank you very much.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.143
How long?

32:17.226 --> 32:18.645
Eight months.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.812
How many claims?

32:19.896 --> 32:22.023
42 as of 2:30.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.734
(telephone ringing)

32:28.571 --> 32:30.531
It's gonna help. Thanks, Sid.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.326
Sorry I didn't grease her more, but I, uh,

32:33.910 --> 32:37.080
-I just couldn't listen anymore.
-Yeah, yeah, no problem.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.416
It all spends, huh, Norm?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.418
I'll see ya, Sid.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.130
Excuse me.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.383
I'm one of the people
involved with this man.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.386
-Oh, you're here for the lineup.
-Yes, sir. I can identify him.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.305
-What's your name, sir?
-Frederick Spears.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.557
You. You go downstairs.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.518
Sir, you can come with me.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.148
Captain Furillo,
I'm with the <i>Post Gazette,</i> sir.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.858
Nothing more from here
till after the arraignment.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.944
Understood,
but I think I have a hot tip for you.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.154
That guy
that they just brought in to lineup,

33:10.238 --> 33:12.448
-says his name is Frederick Spears?
-What about him?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.117
Well, they never gave out pictures.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.119
I don't know
what the guy actually looks like,

33:16.202 --> 33:19.831
but the Spears that got beaten up
by the Creeper, whose wife was killed?

33:19.914 --> 33:22.250
that man was in a coma till six days ago.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.168
I mean, I don't see
how that guy could be him.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.253
Excuse me.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.300
HENRY: <i>Look straight ahead.</i>

33:36.806 --> 33:38.016
Number six.

33:41.102 --> 33:41.936
That's it.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.482
Thank you, Mr. Spears.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.775
I got him, didn't I?

33:48.484 --> 33:49.819
Off the record, yes.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.821
What happens now?

33:51.904 --> 33:53.614
Well, you're the last ID for now.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.533
We're taking him to court to be arraigned.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.166
-When does he go on trial?
-Probably not for quite a while.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.293
-Frederick Spears?
-That's right.

34:05.376 --> 34:07.211
Would you go with this officer, please?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.257
-What the hell, Frank?
-Imposter.

34:12.258 --> 34:15.386
-(indistinct chatter)
-(typing)

34:17.930 --> 34:21.309
Hey, Sergeant Jablonski
told me to bring you this.

34:21.392 --> 34:22.852
All right for the sarge.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.562
Um, how many you got back there?

34:24.645 --> 34:25.938
Just one.

34:26.022 --> 34:29.067
Must have sent extra. There you go.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.860
-Thanks.
-(laughs)

34:32.695 --> 34:36.365
My uncle's been in a coma
ever since it happened.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.868
The doctors say it's gonna be permanent.

34:39.410 --> 34:40.787
He won't die.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.372
He'll just stay like he is.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.125
That's a terrible thing, Mr. Spears,

34:46.667 --> 34:49.045
but you can't take your uncle's place.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.630
And you have to realize

34:50.713 --> 34:53.174
your identification
of Mr. Sawyer isn't valid.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.262
I just wanted to see him.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.806
I can't explain it.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.475
I just had to see,

35:04.185 --> 35:05.603
face to face...

35:09.690 --> 35:11.567
see who he could be...

35:12.735 --> 35:14.278
to do these things.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.114
Go home, Mr. Spears.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.377
He'll get what's coming to him, now.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.633
(door closes)

35:38.261 --> 35:39.971
-Sarge.
-How's it going?

35:40.471 --> 35:43.391
-How come we're using outside food?
-What do you mean?

35:43.474 --> 35:45.309
You sent this guy Jerry in with food.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.937
Get some uniforms down here.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.192
Stop it, man! You're making me dizzy!

35:53.276 --> 35:55.695
Where is he? Where'd they take him?

35:55.778 --> 35:56.779
Jerry?

35:59.866 --> 36:01.033
Leave me alone, Stan!

36:01.576 --> 36:02.410
Are you crazy?

36:02.952 --> 36:05.121
I mean it! Where'd they take him?

36:05.204 --> 36:07.540
Don't be a damn fool.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.500
Drop the gun before you get killed.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.212
I had prostate surgery
three years ago, Stan, a tumor.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.256
I don't care what happens to me!

36:15.339 --> 36:17.550
These would hurt you worse.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.938
I explained to Ms. Davenport

36:31.022 --> 36:33.107
that when you spoke
to your dad on the telephone,

36:33.191 --> 36:35.401
you gave him permission
to get a private attorney.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.819
Uh-huh.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.823
If memory serves, it was Joey, Leo's dad

36:40.907 --> 36:43.201
who contacted me
originally in his defense.

36:43.284 --> 36:47.413
I think I originally was contacted
by his father in that case, too.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.373
JOYCE: If that's what you want,
I'm willing to turn over

36:49.457 --> 36:52.627
your defense, Mr. Sawyer,
but I don't want you to decide

36:52.710 --> 36:55.588
based on mistaken ideas
about my loyalties.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.341
I am married to a police officer.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.594
He's actually the Hill Street captain.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.807
But I secure a higher percentage
of dismissals and acquittals for clients

37:06.891 --> 37:09.685
arrested in this precinct
than any other lawyer.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.437
Any other public defender.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.189
Any other lawyer.

37:15.274 --> 37:16.359
I don't know you.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.779
If you're guilty of the crimes
you'll be charged with,

37:19.862 --> 37:21.906
I don't pretend I'll be sympathetic

37:21.989 --> 37:23.324
or understanding of that,

37:24.283 --> 37:26.577
but that doesn't mean I won't defend you

37:26.661 --> 37:29.455
as aggressively or resourcefully as I can.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.376
End of speech.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.298
-I gotta decide now?
-MARTY: We're about to go to court.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.598
I think I'll use her.

37:55.189 --> 37:59.610
Stan, Stan, forget
you're a cop for just a minute.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.487
Don't you wish I'd killed this maniac?

38:01.570 --> 38:03.531
-No.
-I don't believe it.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.573
Suit yourself.

38:07.076 --> 38:10.204
All right, now.
Now, gimme the straight goods.

38:11.163 --> 38:15.084
Jerry, the straight goods is we've known
each other for a long time,

38:15.167 --> 38:17.878
and you're supposed
to make allowances for friends,

38:17.962 --> 38:20.589
but when I see you
in here waving a piece around

38:20.673 --> 38:25.511
pulling all of this "avenging angel" crap,
a screwball is a screwball.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.264
Now, maybe you got better intentions
than this other wacko,

38:28.806 --> 38:30.808
but I'm glad
you're both gonna be locked up.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.518
Take his picture.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.354
(telephone ringing)

38:35.438 --> 38:37.648
You ever gonna get that AR
on Sawyer in to me--

38:37.732 --> 38:41.193
-Got it right here, Sarge.
-Well, see, what the delay was, Sarge,

38:41.277 --> 38:45.156
is every civilian Tom, Dick, and Harry
trying to put their name down

38:45.239 --> 38:47.199
on our arrest report
so they can get that reward money.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.035
I wasn't gonna say anything, Renko,

38:49.118 --> 38:52.371
but it just so happens now that you
brought it up about greedy people--

38:52.455 --> 38:54.749
That call, that 213 on Sawyer today,

38:54.832 --> 38:56.834
-that was in our sector.
-Your sector?

38:56.917 --> 38:59.628
-Yeah, our sector.
-Well, no, it was all units, wasn't it?

38:59.712 --> 39:01.589
-It was all units.
-It was our sector.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.216
No, Sgt., we acknowledged
and the dispatcher cleared us.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.136
-We were trying to acknowledge--
-You got there late! What's the problem?

39:07.219 --> 39:09.805
There's no problem, Renko,
except I'm just getting frosted.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.640
Every time I go by you today,
you're on the phone.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.894
You're trying to get your little snout
in that reward committee's trough

39:14.977 --> 39:17.813
trying to get some money,
and then, oh, now you complain

39:17.897 --> 39:20.649
about the civilians being greedy,
it just... forget it.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.735
You know, Sergeant,
if it makes any difference,

39:22.818 --> 39:24.487
there's about 50 people
trying to get this money.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.281
-BOBBY: As of 2:00 p.m.
-And I'm out of line.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.951
-HOWARD: Gentlemen!
-Hey, how you doing, Lieutenant?

39:31.035 --> 39:33.162
Say, quite an armful you got there.

39:33.245 --> 39:36.540
Busting the Creeper's gonna close down
half our actives, Lieutenant.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.085
-I'm on my way to his arraignment.
-What for?

39:39.168 --> 39:43.297
Fascination with the abomination,
observe the phenomenon firsthand.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.966
-You guys care to join me?
-No, thanks, Lieutenant.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.219
They say there's a lottery for admission.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.596
-Yeah, hope you make it in, lieutenant.
-Thank you.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.765
-Phenomena?
-You live and learn, Neal.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.102
-I thought the guy was just a scum bucket.
-(chuckles)

39:56.185 --> 39:59.188
IRWIN: Disorderly conduct and threats
against a public official.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.816
According to the arrest report,

40:01.899 --> 40:03.442
you attempted forcible entry

40:03.526 --> 40:05.903
at the office of Police Chief Daniels.

40:05.986 --> 40:09.407
Mr. Sanchez, you threatened
battery against the chief.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.450
Your Honor, this incident resulted

40:11.534 --> 40:14.036
from a minor misunderstanding
which has been cleared up.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.454
We would decline to prosecute.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.164
Where have I seen you, sir?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.084
This a return engagement?

40:20.167 --> 40:23.254
-I was arrested 12 years ago.
-Last few days.

40:23.712 --> 40:26.507
You may have seen Mr. Sanchez
on television today, Your Honor.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.260
-I helped catch the Creeper.
-Is that so?

40:30.886 --> 40:32.513
Should have quit while you were ahead.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.432
-Dismissed.
-(gavel bangs)

40:34.515 --> 40:38.561
BAILIFF: Albert Sawyer,
statute violation 783 through seven,

40:38.644 --> 40:43.816
1217, 1244, four counts of statute 148.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.359
Counsel's been arranged?

40:45.443 --> 40:46.986
Yes, Your Honor.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.696
Martin Dignan, Your Honor.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.574
I believe Mr. Sawyer wishes
a change of counsel.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.659
That's not my understanding, Your Honor.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.622
Want to help us here, Mr. Sawyer?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.460
-I want him.
-Meaning Mr. Dignan?

41:05.004 --> 41:06.046
So indicate.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.882
Why'd you change your mind?

41:09.633 --> 41:11.594
I was just making him sweat a little.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.887
What are you talking about?

41:14.096 --> 41:17.057
He's getting all kind of money
for his story, but they want this lawyer.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.559
-MARTY: Excuse me.
-Who wants it?

41:19.101 --> 41:20.144
That guy.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.313
Some kind of agent.

41:22.396 --> 41:26.108
MARTY: Request arraignment
be postponed 24 hours, Your Honor.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.362
-So ordered. (bangs gavel)
-(spectators murmuring)

41:30.446 --> 41:32.865
(siren wailing)

41:42.291 --> 41:43.584
(siren stops)

41:46.378 --> 41:48.506
Paco Lopez,
he's sitting right around the corner.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.175
-You know where he's at?
-He robbed me, and then he sits there.

41:51.258 --> 41:52.885
-All right, get in the back.
-Come on.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.268
(siren wails)

42:06.941 --> 42:08.317
Paco Lopez! There he is!

42:08.400 --> 42:10.653
Okay, great. Get down on the floor.

42:10.736 --> 42:11.695
On the floor!

42:16.867 --> 42:18.118
(siren stops)

42:22.373 --> 42:23.958
Put your hands up, Paco!

42:26.210 --> 42:28.796
LUCY: Up where we can see them, Paco!

42:28.879 --> 42:30.297
What's the matter?

42:31.048 --> 42:32.883
What, are you crazy? Come on.

42:33.634 --> 42:35.678
Paco, you're under arrest,
assault, robbery.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.181
You guys ain't gonna give me
any straight money, man!

42:39.265 --> 42:41.267
This is my only way I got to do it!

42:41.350 --> 42:42.851
I don't know what you talking about.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.020
The only thing you're getting
this way is busted.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.648
Damn it! Damn it!

42:49.358 --> 42:51.610
(siren wailing)

42:55.614 --> 42:57.783
(indistinct yelling)

42:57.866 --> 43:00.369
He's got a gun
and he's gonna kill himself!

43:00.452 --> 43:02.496
Okay, ma'am, step over here, please.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.164
All right, folks, just step back!

43:04.248 --> 43:06.750
It's your old friend, Manolo.
You're gonna have to get back.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.211
-He's got a gun!
-Ma'am, stand back here, please.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.129
Manolo!

43:11.046 --> 43:12.798
Put the gun down, Manolo!

43:12.881 --> 43:15.801
Combat situation,
it's a different story, man!

43:15.884 --> 43:18.554
Over there, a man's word is
something you can count on!

43:19.930 --> 43:23.642
Over there, you can bet your life
on what a man promises you!

43:23.726 --> 43:26.520
-(shot)
-Do not discharge that weapon again!

43:26.604 --> 43:28.063
But it ain't like that here,

43:28.606 --> 43:30.733
with all the lies and the crap
they're giving you.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.484
They expect you to stand still for it!

43:32.568 --> 43:35.863
Manolo, I know you're upset
at what happened today!

43:35.946 --> 43:37.906
I got handled! I got robbed!

43:37.990 --> 43:39.241
Listen to me now!

43:39.325 --> 43:42.661
Nobody's gonna get nowhere
talking like that, pal!

43:43.954 --> 43:46.206
I was gonna be a cop, man.
I helped catch him.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.044
-Yes, you did!
-I did!

43:50.586 --> 43:51.795
You're damn right you did!

43:53.047 --> 43:54.465
We helped catch him, man.

43:55.966 --> 43:56.842
Now...

43:57.301 --> 43:58.177
(sobbing)

43:58.260 --> 43:59.928
what do we got to show for it?

44:00.012 --> 44:01.221
Now I ain't got nothing!

44:03.641 --> 44:04.933
Look at my car!

44:09.438 --> 44:11.273
Man, I was gonna be a cop.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.028
Give me the gun, Manolo.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.992
Manolo, let me have the gun.

44:24.411 --> 44:27.581
I ain't got a permit for it,
man, I'm telling you now.

44:40.094 --> 44:43.263
There I was, rattling off statistics

44:43.347 --> 44:46.225
about my rate
of dismissals and acquittals.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.811
I felt like a soap salesman.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.400
I didn't know your office
kept those kinds of statistics.

44:54.483 --> 44:55.526
We don't.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.488
But Dignan made me so angry telling...

45:00.072 --> 45:02.533
Sawyer I was in bed
with the precinct captain.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.076
Well, when he's right, he's right.

45:04.159 --> 45:05.536
(chuckles)

45:08.539 --> 45:10.791
Then when Sawyer said
he wanted me to represent,

45:12.334 --> 45:14.253
I heard a little voice inside,

45:15.129 --> 45:16.338
"Nice going, Davenport."

45:18.424 --> 45:20.801
I didn't want to load the dice
while you were deciding,

45:20.884 --> 45:23.971
-but I'm glad you're not defending him.
-(sighs)

45:24.054 --> 45:26.098
Five years in company with that.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.435
It may take someone

45:29.518 --> 45:32.020
who feeds on all the hoopla
and glitz surrounding him.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.189
I think maybe Sawyer has the right man.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.317
We've got that much in common.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.739
I started the day off capturing
that damn Creeper,

45:41.822 --> 45:43.574
and I'm gonna end up going to jail.

45:43.657 --> 45:46.076
Oh, come on, pal, if we was gonna pop you,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.662
do you think we'd be sitting
here trying to sober you up?

45:48.746 --> 45:51.373
You ain't the only person
that's had some heartaches today.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.085
You guys got some police chief.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.379
He doesn't make the rules, Mr. Sanchez.

45:57.463 --> 45:58.714
He could have busted you.

45:58.797 --> 46:02.259
You were down there trying to threaten him
in his own office this afternoon.

46:02.342 --> 46:04.428
-He is a jerk, though.
-(laughs)

46:07.055 --> 46:10.684
We just saw somebody on TV,
and he looks like you.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.352
And, well, we were wondering--

46:12.436 --> 46:15.481
Yeah, that was Manolo.
He's the guy that captured the Creeper.

46:15.564 --> 46:18.317
Little girl,
do you recognize me and my partner?

46:18.400 --> 46:20.319
We were the ones that was--

46:20.402 --> 46:22.571
Manolo, tell her about it.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.538
I was the guy
that hit him with a baseball bat.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.833
He came into my apartment
and tried to attack my wife.

46:36.710 --> 46:38.837
I heard a noise in the hall, so I go out,

46:40.297 --> 46:43.091
and the Creeper jumps me
from behind and knocks me down.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.969
So I get up and run back in my house,

46:46.053 --> 46:47.930
and he's attacking my wife.

46:48.013 --> 46:50.599
So I grab the baseball bat,
and I knock him down.

46:51.725 --> 46:53.143
Then I start beating on him,

46:54.478 --> 46:55.646
and he runs out the window,

46:55.729 --> 46:58.190
and I chase him
down the fire escape and into the hall

46:58.273 --> 46:59.525
and down into the alley.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.487
And I corner him,
and I start beating on him,

47:04.363 --> 47:07.825
and he can't get away.
That was me, Manolo Sanchez.

47:08.575 --> 47:10.536
And I whipped on him good.

47:10.619 --> 47:11.870
DOCTOR: Okay, Robin, come on.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.664
Come on. Push. Robin, give me a good push.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.332
-Come on, honey, push!
-I'm pushing!

47:15.415 --> 47:16.708
More, Robin. Come on.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.001
Good. Okay, relax.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.003
Relax. Do your breathing.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.256
Yeah, steady, steady. Do your breathing.

47:22.339 --> 47:23.715
It's coming again.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.051
Working up
some psychogenic hives, Detective?

47:26.134 --> 47:28.095
Bear down. Bear down. Bear down, Robin.

47:28.178 --> 47:29.680
-Okay, bear down!
-Come on, come on!

47:29.763 --> 47:31.557
There's the head. There's the head.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.933
Can you see the head?

47:33.016 --> 47:34.810
-Yeah! Come on, honey!
-There it is!

47:34.893 --> 47:38.146
Here it is. Here it is.
Here it comes. Here it comes.

47:38.230 --> 47:41.233
Robin! Robin, it's a boy.

47:41.316 --> 47:43.694
(baby crying)

47:44.820 --> 47:47.364
Hi. Oh...

47:47.447 --> 47:48.866
We have a boy.

47:48.949 --> 47:50.951
We have a son.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.871
(emotional music playing)

48:03.338 --> 48:05.340
(theme music playing)
