WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:10.048
I don't think this
blindfold thing's gonna work.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.342
I know these halls better than anyone.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.424
Hey, it's not my surprise
you're spoiling.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.806
All right, but I can't get too far away.
I need to hear the phones.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.477
All right.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.314
I transferred your line.

00:26.485 --> 00:29.602
It's not your fault you got phone duty
during Senator Burke's visit.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.613
But unless he makes a pit stop
to the pole-dancing parlor...

00:32.783 --> 00:35.991
...we|l, then we can still
make it a date.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.447
Jimmy....

00:42.251 --> 00:45.118
Have I mentioned you are the best
boyfriend a girl could have?

00:45.504 --> 00:48.496
Right back at you, sweetheart.

00:52.344 --> 00:56.087
I ﬁgured you could use an escape
from your real-life soap opera.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.217
What do you mean?

01:03.063 --> 01:06.806
Well, you live it every day,
but from the outside.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.727
Your real life's got Cagney
and Stanwyck written all over it.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.572
You've got your billionaire mogul,
the confused damsel...

01:14.825 --> 01:16.986
...who chose money over love,
and the friend...

01:17.161 --> 01:19.698
...who shows up everywhere
because he can't get a job.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.705
Not to mention the steadfast dame
they all depend on.

01:23.709 --> 01:27.543
A real glimpse into the mind
of Jimmy Olsen.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.707
FYI, "dame"? Not so ﬂattering.

01:33.469 --> 01:36.552
-What's your name?
-Riley. Doghouse Riley.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.805
That's a funny kind of name.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.057
You think so?

01:42.770 --> 01:45.352
What are you, a prizeﬁghter?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.228
-No, I 'm a shamus.
-What's a shamus?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.900
It's a private detective.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.476
-You're making fun of me.
-They don't make them like they used to.

01:55.491 --> 01:56.776
Movies or people?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.986
You're cute.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.535
Yeah. Thank you.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.122
-That wasn't from—
-The movie.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.051
Jimmy.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.211
No, tell them we're on our way up.

03:38.427 --> 03:42.386
Female, early twenties,
gunshot wound to the chest.

03:47.269 --> 03:51.808
-ls she gonna be all right?
-She's hurt pretty badly. Come on, Clark.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.644
I'm sorry, Lana.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.108
Sorry I got you caught up in all this.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.031
I'll ﬁnd whoever did this.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.157
I'll ﬁnd them.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.347
-Lex.
-Where is she?

04:31.521 --> 04:35.184
She is being medevaced
to our specialist in Smallville.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.850
-She was with you at the opera.
-You didn't show up.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.152
So I dropped your wife at her car.

04:40.322 --> 04:44.031
-This was about an hour ago.
-You better hope she's all right.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.364
Now, I know someone as alert and
amazing at his job as you must be...

04:52.542 --> 04:54.954
...you must have some idea
what happened here.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.585
Nice try, Miss Lane...

04:58.006 --> 05:02.215
-...but it's not gonna work.
-Well, a girl's gotta try, right?

05:02.386 --> 05:05.628
-Hey, Phil.
-Excuse me.

05:33.375 --> 05:37.584
Oh, man, I am such a klutz.
I'm so sorry.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.916
So the police think
it was a mugging.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.838
-A mugging?
-lnside the building?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.216
Normally I'd be the ﬁrst
to cry foul play...

05:44.386 --> 05:47.423
...but she was downtown,
middle of the night, fancy dress...

05:47.639 --> 05:51.223
...stolen purse. He probablyjumped her
before she knew what was happening.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.055
Am I the only one
that thinks it's weird that she was...

05:54.229 --> 05:57.767
-...with Daddy Warbucks instead of Lex?
-Whoever attacked her is out there.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.559
Jimmy and I saw him ﬂee.
But the police will run prints on the gun.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.147
Which the mugger left behind.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.150
What was Lana doing here
in the middle of the night anyways?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.532
I should've been watching.
Since she married Lex, I've been angry--

06:09.703 --> 06:12.536
Clark, tell me you are not
making this your fault.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.622
I've always been there
for her until now.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.581
-I gotta ﬁnd out who did this.
-Well, the police aren't saying much...

06:20.756 --> 06:23.213
...but maybe you'll have better luck.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.714
Jimmy, I need you to download
the photo of Lana's attacker.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.473
You can ask her.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.482
She never remembers anyway.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.315
Just what did she forget
about Sean Reagan?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.071
What did she tell you?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.116
Take it easy.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.160
I know slaps are good
around this time of the evening.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.749
You go too far, Mariowe.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.674
All right, here's what I got.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.559
-Right over here, boys.
-Listen.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.314
I'll get it right to him.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.314
Sleeping on the job?
What's the big idea?

07:32.702 --> 07:35.034
Well, I don't— I can't—

07:35.205 --> 07:38.868
"I don't"? "I can't"?
What's gotten into you, Jimmy Olsen?

07:39.042 --> 07:41.124
The town's hopping
with the senator's visit.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.287
I didn't take a job slinging coffee
for just anyone.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.421
I picked the best, I tell you, the best.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.885
The Daily Planet's never seen a reporter
like you. I plan on keeping it that way.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.841
Jeez, oh, jeez.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.016
I'm
sorry

08:00.105 --> 08:03.939
Miss Sullivan, we haven't even met
and already I've ruined your blouse.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.479
This is very-- Clark Kent.

08:12.033 --> 08:16.242
K. Kent. I'm Clark Kent.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.867
Chloe Sullivan,
and it's quite all right.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.001
What's with the glasses?

08:30.594 --> 08:33.336
Special delivery
up from the mailroom.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.797
So, what, I'm supposed to answer
your phone now too?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.275
Hello.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.608
Olsen here.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.613
I hear you're the best.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.649
I wanna report a murder.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.406
Whose?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.325
Mine.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.986
I hope I didn't
keep you waiting, Mr. Olsen.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.818
Well, how do you like that.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.366
The untouchable Lana Luthor.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.616
Seems a lot of people got a lot
of ideas about me.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.869
Listen, I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.208
Your old man's gotta own
half of Metropolis...

09:51.383 --> 09:55.843
...not to mention a certain building
at 1000 Broadway. Big globe on top.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.636
Just talking to you
could lose me my job.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.423
Better your job than my life.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.267
My husband's trying to kill me.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.435
Now why would you
believe a thing like that?

10:11.778 --> 10:15.145
The other day l was crossing 6th Street
when out of nowhere this car...

10:15.323 --> 10:18.861
...veered right toward me,
then it sped away.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.944
It was no accident, Jimmy.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.613
You don't mind if I call you
Jimmy, do you?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.665
Actually, it's James.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.000
You're so conﬁdent...

10:33.174 --> 10:35.551
...and so brave,
and I'm so afraid.

10:38.430 --> 10:42.298
I wonder if you could spare a bit
of your strength for me.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.429
Please.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.692
| always knew something
didn't sit right with Luthor.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.690
Just a shame a girl like you had to
get caught up in this rotten business.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.818
Do you have any proof?

11:04.122 --> 11:06.659
I knew I could count on you.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.745
My husband's been
sneaking out at night.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.296
I found this in his pocket.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.845
Consider it a thank-you...

11:23.266 --> 11:25.222
...for your help.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.497
I'm here to see a friend.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.089
Ain't everyone?

11:56.091 --> 11:59.083
Look, I don't want any trouble,
honest, I just came--

11:59.260 --> 12:01.296
The kid's with me.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.567
Eyes back in your head, Olsen.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.117
I didn't peg you as the kind of guy
with a secret identity.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.751
And you're never gonna.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.458
Now, suppose you tell me
what story you're chasing.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.550
No story, just thirsty.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.554
Come on, a guy like you,
with a reputation to uphold?

12:50.812 --> 12:53.144
You wouldn't be caught
100 yards of this place...

12:53.314 --> 12:55.441
...unless you were
sitting on a big scoop.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.147
Rye whiskey.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.436
Rocks.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.821
Put it on his tab, Joe.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.198
Name's Kent.

13:06.202 --> 13:10.491
You stroll in here
with this crackerjack kid....

13:10.665 --> 13:12.371
You trying to land me in the cooler?

13:13.877 --> 13:17.040
Cool yourjets, Mack.
Jimmy here's just a little down on love.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.623
Ain't you, Jimmy?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.584
Poor sucker.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.376
Man, dame's his poison.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.797
If that's what you're after...

14:02.967 --> 14:04.548
...get in line.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.131
No, no, I'm just....

14:16.523 --> 14:18.764
-Who's your new heavy?
-Relax.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.604
I got nothing on Kent so far
but his tab.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.019
Losing your grip, Paps.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.812
You used to run this town.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.984
Now it looks like the only shots
you're calling are from behind that bar.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.753
So it's Luthor you're after.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.873
Better wipe that newsy smile
off your face.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.962
Luthor can smell fresh blood
a mile away.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.468
Fresh? Now, you listen here, Kent--

14:49.639 --> 14:51.345
Relax.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.848
I'm one of the good guys.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.223
Yeah, that's what they all say.

15:01.609 --> 15:07.900
If it's young Luthor you're tailing,
I got a tip for you, on the house.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.943
Every night he makes a big exit,
makes sure the whole joint knows it.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.613
But when his car pulls off
out of the alley...

15:19.002 --> 15:21.209
...he's not in it.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.454
Lex.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.306
Oh, I can't take it anymore.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.812
You're never gonna let me in
on your real life.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.560
Believe me, angel...

17:07.527 --> 17:10.394
...my wife will be out of
the picture soon enough.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.779
You can't keep toying
with a girl's heart like this.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.490
I gotta know it's real.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.415
Is this real?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.375
Hey!

18:51.547 --> 18:54.004
Did anyone follow you?

18:54.175 --> 18:57.463
No. I lost them hours ago.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.387
You shouldn't have come.
He could be home any minute.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.646
I can't bear this much longer.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.146
Has it all been in my head?

19:19.617 --> 19:23.701
Have I been so lonely, I've started
making up stories to amuse myself?

19:26.916 --> 19:29.123
I'm afraid not.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.879
You're right about your husband
wanting to get rid of you. And soon.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.925
If I run, he'll track me down.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.885
And if I confront him, he'll make it
look like an accident.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.146
Don't worry. I'll take care of Lex.

20:14.422 --> 20:18.916
Just to protect yourself, please.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.760
I couldn't bear it
if anything happened to you.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.618
Nice driving back there.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.991
And don't worry...

20:50.166 --> 20:51.997
...I kept my word.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.665
I'm here alone.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.203
I'm afraid your word's
not worth much, Luthor.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.464
Doesn't matter.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.468
By tomorrow you'll be picking
lead out of your lungs.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.801
Not unless you want this
to be the next headline.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.437
I'm guessing this isn't about a raise.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.473
It's about right and wrong.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.359
Now, what you do with the singer,
that's your business...

21:20.529 --> 21:24.021
...but I'm not about to let you
bump off your wife along the way.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.868
Oh, yeah. I heard you say
you were gonna get rid of her.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.157
Sure I am...

21:31.332 --> 21:34.290
...once the divorce is ﬁnal.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.041
I ﬁled for it today.

21:37.046 --> 21:41.335
-Came as a shock to your wife.
-I doubt that.

21:41.509 --> 21:46.674
Don't worry, Jimmy, you're not
the ﬁrst sucker she's spun in her web.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.180
But you better get out
before you stick.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.061
Gardenia.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.508
-Operator, get me junction 435.
-Would I lie to you?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.768
Just came over the wire. Okay.

22:38.733 --> 22:41.224
-What's all the ﬂurry about?
-There's been a murder.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.610
And they say the victim is Lex Luthor.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.945
Oh, criminy.

22:47.116 --> 22:51.234
I am such a klutz. I'm so sorry. Listen,
l'll cover you while you go clean up.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.695
Mr. Lex Luthor, dead on arrival.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.707
A press badge from the Daily Planet
was found on the site...

22:57.877 --> 23:00.744
...with a photo of Mr. Luthor
and that singer.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.708
Now, a suspect was seen
ﬂeeing the scene of the crime.

23:03.883 --> 23:08.798
Suspect, 5'10", brown hair,
brown overcoat, and medium build.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.962
Jimmy.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.308
Last call.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.265
Give me another.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.225
No, make it a double.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.687
Only one thing
will drive a man to drink alone.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.031
| wish it were as simple as a dame.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.659
Nothing simple about them, kid.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.242
Guess that's what keeps us
coming back for more, huh?

23:39.752 --> 23:42.619
Jimmy, I've been to every gin joint
in town looking for you.

23:42.797 --> 23:46.130
-You're not the only one.
-Figured it'd be the last place you were...

23:46.300 --> 23:49.884
...but the ﬁrst place I'd ﬁnd you.
They think you shot Lex Luthor.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.467
Yeah, I shot him, all right.
Went down cold right in front of me.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.012
Listen, I'm not gonna let you
go down for this, Jimmy.

23:57.186 --> 24:00.269
Someone set you up,
and I just might know who did it.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.685
That telephone line
you had for Mrs. Luthor...

24:03.859 --> 24:06.111
...you weren't the only one dialing it.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.360
Seems that shiny new reporter,
Clark Kent's...

24:08.531 --> 24:11.193
...been spinning those numbers
ever since he came to town.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.656
What are you trying to tell me?

24:13.828 --> 24:15.364
Looks like
the boss's old lady...

24:15.538 --> 24:19.702
...might be getting a little more
from Kent than just the headlines.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.710
Yeah, it's me.

24:32.888 --> 24:37.302
Listen, boy wonder may have
taken the bait, but he's onto you.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.977
Doesn't matter anymore.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.261
You're on top
of the lowlife food chain...

24:41.438 --> 24:44.601
...and I'm out from under
a suffocating marriage.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.834
There's something
I have to take care of.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.552
I thought that's what
I was here for.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.763
Don't worry...

25:18.934 --> 25:21.801
...we won't have to
sneak around much longer.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.789
Guess you took me for a patsy,
didn't you, Kent?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.385
You played me
right from the very start.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.343
You saw your chance
to bump off the old man...

26:00.517 --> 26:04.135
...let me take the fall for it,
and you get away with the girl.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.187
But why'd you have to?

26:16.158 --> 26:18.194
He didn't, I did.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.657
Aren't you full of surprises.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.825
I'm sorry I had to drag you
into all this, James. I really am.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.494
They are gonna put me away.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.335
They won't get the chance.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.354
Why'd you make me do it?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.356
It was all for you.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.202
Gardenia.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.378
I should've known better.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.134
Rule number one...

27:16.719 --> 27:18.630
...never get mixed up with a girl...

27:18.846 --> 27:20.711
...not when you're on the job.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.218
On the job?

27:26.854 --> 27:27.889
You're
a cop
9

27:28.897 --> 27:32.389
Undercover unit.
I was sent here to watch Lex Luthor.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.737
Falling in love
with his wife, that was....

27:36.071 --> 27:37.277
That was my mistake.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.366
Those were some eyes
that she had.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.737
Would have made any guy
wanna be a hero.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.122
Yeah, well, those eyes
just got you the electric chair.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.999
Someone should've told you, kid,
there are no heroes in Metropolis.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.972
Jimmy?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.639
Oh, my God, are you all right?

28:17.946 --> 28:18.935
Don't bother.

28:19.114 --> 28:22.277
The picture of Lana's
trigger-happy friend's gone.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.491
Gardenia.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.913
Okay.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.702
It was right in front of me
the whole time, I didn't even see it.

28:30.918 --> 28:34.581
Jimmy, remember me?
The one outside your head?

28:34.755 --> 28:37.963
Lana didn't know you were working.
What if she wasn't here to see you?

28:38.133 --> 28:41.546
-What if she's not innocent?
-Why would she come to the cellar...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.802
-...if it wasn't to visit us?
-Look...

28:43.972 --> 28:45.473
...I know Lana's your friend...

28:45.641 --> 28:49.350
...and you don't wanna think of her
as a two-timing backstabber...

28:49.520 --> 28:52.978
...but, you know, maybe she had
something she couldn't trust you with.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.311
The cigarette case is missing.
Think about it.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.106
Lana doesn't smoke.
What would she be doing with it?

29:04.284 --> 29:05.615
What was inside?

29:05.786 --> 29:07.492
A cigarette case?

29:07.830 --> 29:10.822
Maybe something big enough
to get killed over.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.533
And she was taking it to someone
on the other ﬂoor when she was shot.

29:15.963 --> 29:19.547
So, what, she just staggered
into the elevator and ended up here?

29:25.055 --> 29:27.341
You know, the elevator has a memory.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.349
So its computer could tell us
what ﬂoor it was on last.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.312
l was thinking more gossip column
than political intrigue.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.521
My God.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.360
Lana, what have you
gotten yourself into?

29:51.498 --> 29:52.999
When did you learn to do that?

29:53.167 --> 29:54.703
Some girls go for sports cars...

29:54.877 --> 29:57.664
...I ﬁgured you're more of
a lock-picking kind of girl.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.170
According to the building's
exit records...

30:00.340 --> 30:04.583
...Brennan was the only reporter
left on this ﬂoor when Lana was shot.

30:05.095 --> 30:09.179
Bowling trophies don't exactly scream
cold-blooded killer.

30:12.895 --> 30:16.558
We have reason to believe that
Lana Luthor was with you last night.

30:18.192 --> 30:19.477
I've never met her.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.767
Maybe you shot her
and snagged her purse...

30:21.987 --> 30:24.069
...to make it look like
a petty robbery.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.072
-l'm calling Security.
-Great.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.109
You can tell how you knocked out
Jimmy and erased your photo.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.992
The entire building was sealed off.
Only someone with prior access...

30:34.166 --> 30:36.248
...could have done it.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.789
Hey, look. Mrs. Luthor said
she had a story and wanted to meet.

30:43.008 --> 30:46.421
She must've been getting off the
elevator when someone intercepted her.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.258
I heard the gunshot, I saw the elevator
going down, so I took the stairs.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.592
But when I got there...

30:51.767 --> 30:54.759
...I heard you coming,
and I guess ljust panicked.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.227
I'm sorry about your head.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.935
But if the police had gotten your photo,
they never would've believed me.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.066
What was she bringing to you?

31:03.779 --> 31:07.112
All I know is she said
she needed help, and it had--

31:09.535 --> 31:11.571
Call 911.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.329
Oh, man.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.270
You didn't have to wait
till the last second.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.651
What fun would that be?

31:49.491 --> 31:50.651
Chloe.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.691
Chloe.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.027
Oh, my God. Chloe.

31:55.205 --> 31:58.242
-Did you get him?
-I knocked him out cold, but--

31:58.500 --> 32:02.368
You don't have a scratch on you.
I don't understand. How is that—?

32:14.850 --> 32:15.930
Thank you.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.811
Busy day, Miss Lane?

32:33.827 --> 32:37.115
Does breaking and entering
not mean anything to rich people?

32:38.332 --> 32:41.824
About as much as removing evidence
from a crime scene.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.493
I caught your little maneuver
at the Planet.

32:47.466 --> 32:52.756
So it didn't surprise me
that a piece of evidence was missing.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.504
The silver cigarette case.

32:55.974 --> 33:00.513
Really, Mr. Luthor, l was lucky to get
a quote from a parking attendant.

33:00.729 --> 33:01.969
George.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.661
Lillian loved this.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.410
My wife, she was fond of gardenias.

33:24.920 --> 33:25.955
You open this?

33:27.297 --> 33:28.878
There was nothing on it.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.761
Ares is supposed to be operational.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.393
We're in the ﬁnal stages
of testing, senator.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.940
Well, after all my shufﬂing...

33:46.108 --> 33:49.942
...to keep the appropriations
under the radar, I certainly hope so, Lex.

33:50.112 --> 33:53.479
We both have a lot to lose, senator.

33:54.908 --> 33:58.116
You didn't know Lex was working
with Senator Burke, did you?

34:01.790 --> 34:05.703
You have got to give Lana major props
for double-crossing both Luthors.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.969
I'd be careful...

34:15.137 --> 34:17.423
...Miss Lane.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.337
Whoever's protecting Senator Burke...

34:19.516 --> 34:23.259
...hired someone
to kill the wife of a Luthor.

34:27.232 --> 34:31.601
I doubt whether they'd think twice
about silencing you.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.342
Close call.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.505
Luckily I don't remember much.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.517
Let me ﬁll you in
on a few of the details.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.980
Someone didn't want you
and Brennan to expose...

35:11.151 --> 35:13.062
...whatever was
in that cigarette case...

35:13.278 --> 35:17.863
...so they tried to kill you,
and succeeded with him.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.819
Now, I know that Lex
would never do anything...

35:20.994 --> 35:24.907
...to hurt the love of his life,
but who did?

35:25.582 --> 35:29.040
Chloe, if I could tell you, I would.
It's complicated.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.202
I'm a quick learner.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.373
Lionel.

35:36.718 --> 35:40.302
He's been forcing me to dig into Lex
and turn over everything to him.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.303
Lionel has you spying on Lex?

35:43.850 --> 35:46.387
But instead of giving him
the information you found...

35:46.561 --> 35:49.018
...you were gonna give it
to the papers?

35:51.191 --> 35:52.727
Why?

35:52.901 --> 35:55.233
It was my only way
to get out from under them.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.314
I don't understand.

35:57.489 --> 36:01.573
I mean, Lionel has a league
of minions. Why you?

36:04.871 --> 36:07.908
He needed someone on the inside.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.576
Someone who could
get close to Lex.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.218
Lana, is that why
you went through with the wedding?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.383
Why would you do that?

36:25.725 --> 36:27.556
To protect Clark.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.853
From what?

36:29.020 --> 36:30.726
Clark can take care of himself.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.433
What about his weakness?

36:32.774 --> 36:34.935
Chloe, you admitted yourself
that he has one.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.476
Whatever Clark is capable of...

36:38.446 --> 36:41.904
...there's something
stronger than him, isn't there?

36:43.994 --> 36:47.486
If you're keeping this from Clark
because you're trying to protect him...

36:47.664 --> 36:49.780
-...he needs to know.
-He can't.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.002
Chloe, I know that
you conﬁde everything in him...

36:53.169 --> 36:55.626
...but I need you to trust me.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.251
Clark's life could depend on it.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.767
I've been all over town,
all I can ﬁnd out about the guy...

37:10.937 --> 37:13.098
...who attacked Lana
is that he's a hired gun.

37:13.273 --> 37:16.106
He's out of commission,
so it looks like we hit a dead end.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.641
That's it?

37:17.819 --> 37:19.605
Someone takes a hit out on Lana...

37:19.779 --> 37:22.111
...and you're just gonna
give up just like that?

37:25.535 --> 37:27.992
You're holding back
something from me, aren't you?

37:28.163 --> 37:30.028
Chloe, I can't believe you'd lie to me.

37:30.206 --> 37:33.118
I can't believe you didn't hear
the irony in that statement.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.660
-You know how much she means to me.
-First, ouch.

37:36.838 --> 37:40.626
Second, if you really wanna help,
Clark, just stay out of it, okay? Please.

37:43.345 --> 37:46.508
I'm gonna ﬁnd Lana's attacker,
with or without you.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.476
How long have you kept
your secret from Lana...

37:50.644 --> 37:52.726
...because you were
trying to protect her?

37:54.356 --> 37:56.813
Are you telling me
Lana's doing this to protect me?

37:56.983 --> 37:59.725
Look, all I'm saying is that
sometimes people do things...

37:59.945 --> 38:02.687
...that you don't expect,
and you don't understand.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.857
And sometimes they have
a really good reason for it.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.196
As much as I wanna believe that
that reason is Lex--

38:12.374 --> 38:15.036
We both know he'd never
do anything to hurt her.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.326
Well, then if it's not Lex, then....

38:21.257 --> 38:25.091
There's only one other person
who would manipulate her like that.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.815
Take it from the look
on your face...

38:40.986 --> 38:43.068
...the cops can't get
Lana's attacker to talk.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.273
Didn't have a chance.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.606
Guy got knocked off
right after he landed in county lockup.

38:48.410 --> 38:49.525
Mr. Luthor...

38:49.703 --> 38:54.572
...the gun at the crime scene
didn't belong to the assailant. It's yours.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.614
Mine?

38:57.502 --> 39:00.369
-Police never mentioned--
-lt's unregistered.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.914
I pulled the ballistics report,
it matches your gun. The missing one.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.545
My guess is Lana's
been carrying it...

39:06.720 --> 39:09.427
...pulled it on whoever
confronted her and lost.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.134
Lana's never carried a gun.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.592
What would she be so afraid of?

39:32.287 --> 39:34.653
There's my hero.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.116
Just my luck.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.661
I ﬁnally get a photo,
I'm in front of the camera.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.373
Even I was impressed
with the Sam Spade quick thinking.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.210
You can't tell me all that
just came from a bonk on the noggin.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.965
You know, it was so weird.

39:48.136 --> 39:51.173
Half of it made sense,
but Lana and Lionel working together...

39:51.347 --> 39:54.384
...and Clark Kent leading a double life
as a reporter by day...

39:54.601 --> 39:57.138
...and crime ﬁghter by night....

39:58.104 --> 40:00.481
You know, it's funny
what your mind will cook up.

40:01.608 --> 40:05.647
So why the pilgrimage to Podunk
at the peak of your fame?

40:07.655 --> 40:11.193
Well, I made you a playlist
to keep you company while I'm gone.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.741
Gone?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.671
