♪♪

00:06.173 --> 00:09.174
-Everybody stop!
-All: What?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.427
(table rattles)

00:11.428 --> 00:13.679
Is it just me,
or is this table just
a little bit wiggly?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.280
Huh.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.216
Oh!

00:17.218 --> 00:19.485
Sorry, I thought
you were just realizing
how ugly your sweater is.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.253
(laughs)

00:22.623 --> 00:24.990
Well listen,
if it is wiggly,

00:24.992 --> 00:28.160
Your dad will fix it
next time he's home
from his coaching job.

00:28.162 --> 00:32.164
When dad is away,
I am the man of the house,

00:32.166 --> 00:33.632
And the man of the house

00:33.634 --> 00:36.135
Is gonna fix this here table.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.302
I'm going in.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.637
What?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.407
(rattling, thumping)

00:41.409 --> 00:43.042
(clanking)

00:43.044 --> 00:46.078
So how is high school going
for my newly-minted freshman?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.881
Well, astrophysics
and organic chemistry
are cinchy,

00:48.883 --> 00:52.151
But I have to do
a dumb art project
for my dumb art class.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.285
(sputters)

00:55.156 --> 00:58.257
Well parker, you're living
with an artiste.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.391
Let me help you.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.660
Liv. Liv, honey,
I mean, you have

01:01.662 --> 01:03.862
A lot on your plate
with school and <i> voltage</i> .

01:03.864 --> 01:05.564
Don't you think you might be
overextending yourself?

01:05.566 --> 01:06.899
Well, I mean...

01:06.901 --> 01:08.367
Things are pretty hectic
for me right now,

01:08.369 --> 01:10.235
But it's not like
you have a free moment

01:10.237 --> 01:12.337
With dad gone, mom,
and-- and, you know,

01:12.339 --> 01:14.706
I always make time
for my little brother.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.841
Cool.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.376
Thanks, liv.
It's due Friday.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.777
Oh, yeah.
Perfect. Easy.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.212
I can help you
after work on Thursday.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.047
Oh! Guys?

01:22.049 --> 01:25.084
Guys, totally just found
the wobbly leg,

01:25.086 --> 01:26.952
-So I'm gonna lift
this side up...
-No, no--

-Wow!

02:40.794 --> 02:45.464
Girls, it is time
to meet your new coach.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.366
Oh!

02:47.367 --> 02:49.267
She is a former
high school basketball star

02:49.270 --> 02:50.869
And she is tough as nails.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.471
Oh, awesome!

02:52.473 --> 02:53.805
I cannot wait to meet her.

02:53.807 --> 02:57.209
Oh, actually,
you already have.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.015
Hello, children.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.351
All:
Mrs. Snodgrass?!

03:06.353 --> 03:09.555
It's coach snodgrass.

03:11.025 --> 03:15.994
Mrs. Snodgrass was
our super mean teacher
in sixth grade.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.029
(scoffs)

03:17.031 --> 03:19.164
She said I had
attitude problems.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.833
You scream,
"bam! What?!" one time

03:21.835 --> 03:23.468
In a teacher's face
during a spelling bee,

03:23.470 --> 03:26.371
And suddenly,
you're labeled for life.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.373
All right.
Form a line, children.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.045
I remember all of you
from the sixth grade.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.547
Not fondly,
I might add.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.350
Willow cruz.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.420
The girl who could never
master multiplying fractions.

03:41.422 --> 03:47.392
I am three-fourths sorry
about that, mrs. Snodgrass.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.531
Astrid stanislowski.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.901
It's stains now,
mrs. Snodgrass.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.571
Chew with your mouth closed,
and maybe it won't be.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.243
And speaking of nicknames,

04:04.245 --> 04:07.913
It's madison
"inappropriate outburst" rooney.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.748
That's me.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.450
Hey, mrs. Snodgrass,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.884
Um...

04:12.886 --> 04:15.187
Okay, I don't mean
for this to sound

04:15.189 --> 04:17.022
Like an inappropriate outburst,

04:17.024 --> 04:20.659
But have you ever
coached before?

04:22.463 --> 04:27.432
Sounds like someone still
has attitude problems.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.134
All:
Ooh...

04:29.136 --> 04:33.805
Please take a seat in
the attitude adjustment chair.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.808
(gasps)
no!

04:36.810 --> 04:38.877
She brought the chair!

04:40.547 --> 04:43.849
I'm having flashbacks, man!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.220
(clears throat)

04:56.230 --> 04:58.297
Hey! Okay, andie--

04:58.299 --> 04:59.831
Ooh!

05:01.268 --> 05:04.503
Is that a picture
of dump truck
in your locker?!

05:04.505 --> 05:09.007
Oh, and it's covering up
a photo of a motorcycle!

05:09.009 --> 05:11.476
Things must be getting serious.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.579
-They are.
-Oh!

05:14.581 --> 05:17.516
I am so super-happy
hanging with the dump.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.586
It is so different
from hanging with holden.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.855
I mean, you probably have
more in common with holden

05:23.857 --> 05:25.490
Than I ever did.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.493
(sputters)

05:30.664 --> 05:34.099
What do I have
in common with holden?

05:34.101 --> 05:37.669
Besides everything
because we are meant
to be together.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.171
Are you kidding me?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.972
You guys both like
the same music,

05:40.974 --> 05:42.774
The same movies,
the same books--

05:42.776 --> 05:44.609
(gasps)
liv...

05:44.611 --> 05:46.845
You should totally
go out with holden!

05:48.449 --> 05:50.682
What?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.518
No!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.786
No.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.621
No. Look, see, 'cause, like,
but what about the--

05:56.623 --> 05:58.323
The-- the girl code,
you know?

05:58.325 --> 06:00.659
I couldn't date my friend's ex.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.461
-The girl code?
-Yeah.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.862
(scoffs)
that's dumb.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.999
What about the friend code?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.668
You're my friend.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.737
-I want you to be happy.
-Oh!

06:11.739 --> 06:13.638
If dating holden
makes you happy,

06:13.640 --> 06:14.873
Then go for it.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.710
Ugh.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.312
I mean,
I gotta think about it.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.914
Yeah...

06:22.916 --> 06:24.149
Think, think, think.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.884
Thinking, thinking...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.119
Holden!

06:28.589 --> 06:30.255
-Hi.
-Hey, liv.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.423
Do you need something?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.557
Yes.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.126
You.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.561
What?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.398
Holden, will you go
out with me?

06:40.401 --> 06:41.867
Seriously?
But-- but I-- I thought

06:41.869 --> 06:44.002
You said we couldn't date
because you didn't want
to hurt andie.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.771
Well, I know, but actually,
andie's the one who told me

06:45.773 --> 06:47.239
To come over here
and do this.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.974
It turns out she doesn't care
about you, like, at all.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.845
So... Will you go out with me?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.680
Yes.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.382
-(squeals)
-yes! No, I'll--

06:57.384 --> 06:58.583
I'll absolutely
go out with you.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.584
I don't want to wait
another minute.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.919
-Come on! Let's go!
-Okay! Oh, wait!

07:00.921 --> 07:02.788
No. Well, I mean,
right now we have school.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.092
-What about tonight though?
-I can't tonight. Tomorrow?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.693
-I'm working.
-Uh, how about Thursday?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.529
Thursday should be wide open.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.797
-Holden: Yes!
-(liv gasps)

07:11.799 --> 07:14.132
Oh, this is so romantic!

07:14.134 --> 07:15.567
Whoa! No!

07:15.569 --> 07:18.136
This cannot happen!

07:18.138 --> 07:20.539
Oh, no, no, no.
Andie said it was okay.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.607
Oh. Well, then yes.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.210
Willow, stop getting
in the way of love!

07:29.650 --> 07:30.816
Both:
Oh!

07:39.493 --> 07:42.761
We're going to work
on fundamentals.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.665
Let's start by lowering
your center of gravity.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.835
You do that by
opening your pelvic bowl.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.806
And we squat.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.743
Um...

07:58.745 --> 08:00.445
So coach snodgrass,
we're actually used to

08:00.447 --> 08:02.747
Starting out with passing
and dribbling skills,

08:02.749 --> 08:03.915
So...

08:03.917 --> 08:06.751
And I'm used to children
following instructions.

08:06.753 --> 08:10.255
For our next fundamental,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.624
Smell your pits
and turn away.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.093
Smell your pits
and turn away.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.529
Smell your pits
and turn away.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.830
All right, you know what?
I'm team captain.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.865
I should say something.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.766
Hey, so...

08:21.768 --> 08:24.769
Coach snodgrass, um,
can I have a word?

08:24.771 --> 08:26.705
I believe you meant to say,

08:26.707 --> 08:30.041
"may I have a word,"
but proceed.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.446
Um, so...

08:34.448 --> 08:36.681
We are state champs,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.984
And we are ready
for basketball practice

08:38.986 --> 08:41.553
With actual basketballs.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.721
(chuckles)

08:42.723 --> 08:45.156
Basketballs are for children

08:45.158 --> 08:47.692
Who have mastered
the fundamentals.

08:47.694 --> 08:52.330
Now, for our next drill,
everybody grab a dead fish

08:52.332 --> 08:55.000
Out of the bucket
and put it under your chin.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.569
And miss rooney...

08:57.571 --> 09:01.873
Since you're team captain,
you get two.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.675
(mouthing)
what? Help me!

09:06.813 --> 09:09.814
This table doesn't
wobble anymore.

09:09.816 --> 09:14.553
I needed tools to fix it,
so I went to the hardware store.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.121
I go there now.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.826
Problem solved
man-of-the-house style.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.431
Yeah, I wouldn't exactly
call it solved.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.933
Just different.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.368
You're right.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.504
These chairs are much too tall.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.111
Hey. What's with
the paintbrushes?

09:40.113 --> 09:42.113
Seriously?
You walk into a room

09:42.115 --> 09:43.515
With a 14-inch table,

09:43.517 --> 09:45.850
And you're asking
about paintbrushes?

09:45.852 --> 09:48.420
Joey said he needed
to fix the table.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.921
You're honestly surprised?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.024
Good point.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.261
Yeah, the-- the paintbrushes
are for my dumb art project,

09:56.263 --> 09:59.130
But I was hoping something
other than joey's munch-ness

09:59.132 --> 10:00.565
Would come up
to distract me.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.334
-(tablet rings)
-sweet! It worked!

10:05.439 --> 10:08.139
Dad? Yes!

10:08.141 --> 10:11.576
-Sounds like somebody
misses ol' dad!
-Parker: Are you kidding me?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.479
You calling at this exact moment
is the greatest thing ever.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.914
Let's talk for hours.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.948
Wait. Hold on.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.816
I actually needed
to talk to dad.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.217
-Give me that.
-Hey!

10:19.219 --> 10:20.986
You just dad-blocked me!

10:20.988 --> 10:22.988
Pete:
<i>Hang on, kids.</i>

10:22.990 --> 10:25.991
There's plenty of wisdom
to go around.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.292
Okay, so-- wha--

10:27.294 --> 10:29.327
<i>Whoa. Getting a little</i>
<i>motion sickness here.</i>

10:29.329 --> 10:30.829
You know what, maddie?!

10:30.831 --> 10:33.164
You got me so riled up,
I can't work on art anymore.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.000
-I hope you're happy!
-Ha ha!

10:36.236 --> 10:39.304
Ugh. Dad, I am so glad
that you called.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.906
I really need to talk to you.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.475
<i>What's going on, maddie?</i>

10:43.477 --> 10:46.978
Mom hired mrs. Snodgrass
as our basketball coach,

10:46.980 --> 10:48.613
And she has us doing
these stupid drills

10:48.615 --> 10:51.316
That have nothing to do
with stupid basketball!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.917
Do you hear how mad I am?

10:52.919 --> 10:55.854
She just made me call
basketball stupid.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.821
<i>Maddie...</i>

10:56.823 --> 10:58.990
You're a great player,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.258
But no matter
how good you get,

11:00.260 --> 11:02.994
You're never
finished learning.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.796
Trust in the process.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.032
Do whatever your coach says.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.367
Everybody's got
somethin' to teach you.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.002
(sighs)
yeah, I know.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.038
I'm-- I'm--
I'm really trying, dad.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.539
I just...

11:14.541 --> 11:17.008
What happens when I go
to practice on Monday

11:17.010 --> 11:19.811
And snodgrass makes
us do some...

11:19.813 --> 11:21.846
Wow. Whoa.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.782
Oh.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.817
Hey, dad!

11:25.819 --> 11:30.221
Hey, I'm havin' a little trouble
startin' up this here chainsaw.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.523
(chuckles)

11:31.525 --> 11:33.558
Gotta use the tablet
to look up how to do it online.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.793
Buh-bye now!

11:34.795 --> 11:36.928
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, h-- hang on a second--

11:39.900 --> 11:42.834
So tonight, we're actually
going on our first date!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.669
Holden has it all planned out.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.805
We're gonna go
on a horse-drawn carriage ride

11:46.807 --> 11:49.674
Followed by a candlelit dinner
at van snooten's.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.977
Ooh, van snooten's? Classy.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.380
Yeah, well, we really
wanted to do it right.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.648
Um, I should get going.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.316
Oh! Heads up,
the network scheduled

11:58.318 --> 12:00.919
An on-set fan meet-and-greet
with their favorite superhero.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.253
Oh! Amazing!

12:02.255 --> 12:05.390
-I love meeting my fans.
When is that?
-Yeah. Right now.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.424
-It's right now?
-Yeah.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.426
Right-- oh, hello...

12:08.428 --> 12:11.696
Adorable fans
who are here on date night.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.866
Um, welcome to
the set of <i> voltage</i> .

12:14.868 --> 12:16.634
Does anybody have
any questions?

12:17.671 --> 12:18.937
Question one.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.007
In the comic books,
tess gets struck by lightning

12:23.009 --> 12:25.076
On a Thursday,
but in the show,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.344
It's a Friday.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.512
Please explain.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.415
Ooh. Uh...

12:30.417 --> 12:31.783
I don't really know
the answer to that.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.018
Maybe because that's when
football games happen?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.520
Uh-huh...

12:35.522 --> 12:36.588
Question two.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.191
I really wanted
to leave for date night, but...

12:40.193 --> 12:42.861
These were my fans,
and I was their superhero,

12:42.863 --> 12:47.031
And skyvolt was not gonna let
dr. Questions defeat her.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.967
-Question 38.
-Hm?

12:48.969 --> 12:53.138
In the comic books,
your cape is 36 inches long.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.774
In the show,
it appears to be...

12:55.776 --> 12:57.041
38 inches.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.077
Please explain.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.647
The camera adds two inches.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.782
Noted.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.785
Okay. Does anybody else
have any questions?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.353
They don't.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.924
Question 39.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.159
(phone rings)

13:14.161 --> 13:15.660
Oh! Um, so sorry.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.362
Can you just
give me one second?
I'll be right back.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.834
Hey, holden.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.602
Holden:
<i>It's date night!</i>

13:24.604 --> 13:26.271
And I'm super excited!

13:26.273 --> 13:28.306
Um, I just...

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
I have a thing

13:29.643 --> 13:31.576
With some fans
and then I do still

13:31.578 --> 13:33.778
Have to help parker afterwards,
but then after that,

13:33.780 --> 13:35.113
I am all yours.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.198
<i>Well, I mean,</i>
<i>if it's easier,</i>

13:36.199 --> 13:37.282
<i>We could do</i>
<i>something more low-key</i>

13:37.284 --> 13:38.650
<i>Like pizza and a movie.</i>

13:38.652 --> 13:40.618
You're so sweet.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.287
Um, but I...
I don't know.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.788
I sort of feel like
that's a better, like,

13:43.790 --> 13:44.823
Second date, you know?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.925
And-- and we've just
been waiting so long

13:46.926 --> 13:49.026
For our first one,
I don't want to ruin
your amazing plans.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.830
We're still totally on
for tonight.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.164
It just might have to be
a little bit later.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.466
I'm so sorry.
I'll talk to you soon.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.202
-Bye.
<i>-Okay. Bye.</i>

14:01.107 --> 14:03.775
Okay.

14:03.777 --> 14:04.843
Where were we?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.077
Question 39.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.854
Remember,
sight isn't everything.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.623
You have to be able
to smell, hear,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.558
And taste the other team.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.294
Okay, I'm sorry.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.129
Coach snodgrass,

14:25.131 --> 14:27.799
Can we stop this nonsense
and, like...

14:27.801 --> 14:29.534
Play actual basketball?

14:29.536 --> 14:30.902
Oh.
(chuckles)

14:30.904 --> 14:33.304
Sounds to me like we have
an insubordinate player

14:33.306 --> 14:35.607
Who still has
attitude problems.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.144
Well, it sounds to me
like we have a coach

14:40.146 --> 14:42.180
Who doesn't actually know
how to play basketball.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.248
(all gasp)

14:45.819 --> 14:47.919
Is that what you think?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.621
Children, clear the court.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.924
You and I,
miss madison rooney,

14:52.926 --> 14:55.593
Are goin' one on one.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.329
Oh.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.732
It's on.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.074
Whew. Hi.
Sorry I'm so late.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.510
What happened to our table?

15:12.512 --> 15:14.746
Oh. Joey fixed it.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.180
Ugh.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.749
When are we gonna fix joey?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.220
Let's, uh, let's get
this art project done.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.922
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.891
Oh, and while I was waiting,
I got inspired.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.227
I have a pretty great idea
for my art project.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.929
Ooh, yay!

15:30.931 --> 15:33.231
So, what do you need
the artiste to do, huh?

15:33.233 --> 15:36.234
Watercolored flowers?
Some decoupage?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.502
Stick your arms
in these buckets.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.139
Okay.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.074
Blagh.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.143
Really wish I could say
this is the strangest thing

15:45.145 --> 15:47.378
That you've had me do,
but it is so not.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.849
Yeah, we've had
some good times, liv.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.854
(squish)

15:59.926 --> 16:05.129
So, this is
incredibly unpleasant.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.498
Just be patient.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.467
Once these dry,
I can use them as a mold

16:09.469 --> 16:10.902
To cast copies
of your arms.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.570
Okay, well, how long
until they're fully dry?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.172
I don't know.
Probably five minutes.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.140
-Let me check the box.
-Okay.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.246
Oh. "five hours"?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.617
My bad.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.119
Five hours?!

16:28.121 --> 16:29.854
Parker, I have a date tonight!

16:29.856 --> 16:32.991
My advice,
go big with the earrings

16:32.993 --> 16:35.593
So he doesn't notice
the plaster on your arms.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.828
Parker!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.532
Ugh!

16:41.534 --> 16:43.034
Ugh.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.237
Ugh.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.576
(squeak)

16:52.879 --> 16:54.178
-(thump)
-ooh!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.546
(thud)

16:55.548 --> 16:57.015
Oh!

16:58.351 --> 16:59.884
(grunts, breathes heavily)

17:01.454 --> 17:02.487
(squeak, thump)

17:02.489 --> 17:04.122
-Ooh!
-(thud)

17:05.492 --> 17:06.524
(grunts)

17:06.526 --> 17:09.360
(chuckles)

17:13.133 --> 17:14.198
(grunts)

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
(chuckles)

17:19.239 --> 17:21.372
Ooh! Okay.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.508
(beep)

17:23.510 --> 17:25.343
Contacts.
(chuckles)

17:25.345 --> 17:26.577
-(beep)
-holden!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.347
-(chuckles)
<i>-(phone rings)</i>

17:29.349 --> 17:30.381
Holden:
<i>Hey, liv!</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:31.682
<i>Clap your hands</i>
<i>if you're ready</i>

17:31.684 --> 17:33.618
<i>For the best first date ever!</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:37.390 --> 17:41.859
Yeah, so about that. Um...

17:41.861 --> 17:44.962
Parker has encased me in plaster
for the next five hours.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.066
I'm really sorry.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.835
Holden, I don't think
I'm gonna be able
to do this tonight.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.670
Please tell me you weren't,
like, about to leave

17:52.672 --> 17:54.839
Your house or something.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.674
<i>No, not at all.</i>

17:58.044 --> 17:59.610
Yeah, no.
I was, um...

17:59.612 --> 18:01.345
Wrapping up some homework.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.514
Um, we can do this later.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.582
Yeah.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.251
Yeah.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.593
(snaps)

18:15.595 --> 18:17.295
(snaps)

18:17.297 --> 18:19.897
(snaps)

18:19.899 --> 18:22.200
Are you ready
to do this?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.709
Let's ball, mad dog.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.154
(whistle blows)

18:43.156 --> 18:44.489
Offensive foul.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.491
Ball goes to coach snodgrass.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.159
-Ugh!
-(laughs)

18:48.161 --> 18:51.562
You just got
pelvic bowled, young lady.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.473
If I can smell you,
I can stop you.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.617
I can't see, girls.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.519
Is she crying yet?

19:17.257 --> 19:19.824
Hey, no way
you're getting past me.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.359
I don't have to.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.760
The ball does.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.496
I just smell my pits
and turn away.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.307
That's game.
Coach snodgrass wins.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.477
I'm flabbergasted, man.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.345
Wow.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.816
So, all of that stuff
that I thought was so stupid...

19:45.818 --> 19:47.018
Really works.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.321
I have no idea what to say
to you right now.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.456
I do.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.859
Bam! What?!

19:59.899 --> 20:01.799
Hey, um...

20:03.836 --> 20:05.636
I'm sorry.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.708
I guess I'm just having
a bit of a tough time

20:10.710 --> 20:12.176
Adjusting to a new coach.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.744
Of course you are.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.513
Change is hard.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.981
Yeah.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.016
It is.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.985
Also, if we're being
completely honest,

20:20.987 --> 20:24.989
I'm really, really
missing my dad...

20:24.991 --> 20:27.525
Just 'cause he's
kind of the only coach
I have ever played for.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.428
I hear you, maddie...

20:30.430 --> 20:31.529
But I think you meant to say,

20:31.531 --> 20:35.099
"the only coach that
for whom I've ever played".

20:38.171 --> 20:39.403
Think about where
the preposition goes

20:39.405 --> 20:40.938
While you give me ten laps.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.443
Thanks, coach.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.516
(doorbell)

20:52.518 --> 20:54.285
Coming!

20:54.287 --> 20:56.954
-(doorbell)
-I'm coming!

20:56.956 --> 20:59.624
-(doorbell)
-coming!

20:59.626 --> 21:01.525
(thump)

21:03.463 --> 21:05.963
You know what?
Just-- just come on in. Just...

21:08.368 --> 21:09.533
Holden!

21:09.535 --> 21:11.435
Wow! You're, um...

21:11.437 --> 21:13.804
Really encased
in plaster there, aren't ya?

21:13.806 --> 21:16.040
You know, for a second,
I thought that

21:16.042 --> 21:17.541
You were coming up
with a lot of weird ways

21:17.543 --> 21:18.609
To blow me off.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.812
Nope, this really is my life.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.614
But-- but why are you here?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.116
And why do you have a pizza?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.817
I mean, I know it's not
the fancy date

21:26.819 --> 21:29.587
That we had planned,
but any time that I get

21:29.589 --> 21:31.689
To spend with you is the most
special time I can imagine.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.595
-You're so--
-(thump)

21:37.597 --> 21:39.330
-Oh!
-Oh! I'm sorry!

21:39.332 --> 21:40.598
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-It's okay.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.166
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.168
-I'll hug you in, like,
two to three hours.
-Okay.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.569
-Okay.
-Come on.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.971

21:46.973 --> 21:49.240
-Right.
-May I take your plastery
lump, my dear?

21:49.242 --> 21:50.274
-You may!
-Okay.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.909
-All right, here we go.
-Heavy, right?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.477
-Yep. It's not bad...
-I'm not crazy.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.146
No. We're fine.
We're good. All right.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.480
You're such a gentleman.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.650
There we go.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.285

-Good?

22:01.287 --> 22:02.687

22:05.124 --> 22:06.691
<i>(romantic music plays)</i>

22:11.597 --> 22:14.165
This was totally
worth the wait.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.500
Yeah.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.870
This is the best
first-second date ever.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.140
Yeah.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.408
It is.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.348
-Pepperoni?
-Yes, please!

22:34.821 --> 22:37.455
Parker, dinner's ready!

22:37.457 --> 22:38.689
Come to...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.094
What's left of the table!

22:44.630 --> 22:48.966
But mom, the table
is totally level! Ha ha!

22:48.968 --> 22:51.001
You know, most boys
would've just waited

22:51.003 --> 22:53.471
For their dad to come home,
but no, not me.

22:53.473 --> 22:57.274
Oh, my special boy.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.145
So, what's next, you know?

23:01.147 --> 23:03.047
-What else can
papa joe-joe fix?
-Nothing!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.648
I mean...

23:04.650 --> 23:07.551
You have worked so,
so hard already.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.654

What'd you make?

23:14.360 --> 23:17.428
Behold arm-rachnid!

23:23.669 --> 23:24.702
Oh.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.537
Why's it got a picture
of liv on the front?

23:26.539 --> 23:28.939
Oh, because she wouldn't
let me plaster her head.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.277

Bam! What?!
