WEBVTT

00:55.522 --> 00:59.358
It's just the heat. That's all.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.594
You want me to stop? I can stop.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.230
No, I think I just gotta
get my pills.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.580
Oh, pull over.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.427
Alright, Scarlett.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.547
"The charm of yesterday,
the convenience of tomorrow."

02:28.549 --> 02:31.550
Shit. I mean, it's so wrong,
it's right.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.290
-You seem to be feeling better.
-Yeah, brand new.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.459
I think I puked it all out.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.465
God, where the hell are we?

02:46.467 --> 02:49.668
I don't know. Some old
town like a million others.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.708
I swear I've been here before.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.778
This place? No. All these
old towns look the same.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.481
Oh, like this place? No way.

03:16.262 --> 03:20.432
Whoa. I wonder
what the rooms are like.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.502
Tiny bathrooms and musty carpet.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.537
If you're feeling better,
we should really get going.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.274
What? We can't not stay here.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.809
You go get the bags...

03:32.479 --> 03:33.912
...and I'll get us a room.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.218
We're on the end.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.808
What the fuck?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.276
What?

04:04.278 --> 04:05.978
There's mud
in the bathtub.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.814
You're not gonna take a bath,
are you?

04:10.016 --> 04:12.251
I guess I wasn't, no.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.720
Well, then don't worry about it.
I like this room.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.389
-You do?
-I got a surprise for us.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.858
Where'd you get that?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.361
Front desk runs
little concessions.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.563
Strictly on the downlow.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.897
And those are?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.867
Southwest shot glasses.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.537
<i> Muy aut√©ntico.</i>

04:32.539 --> 04:35.807
Nice. But didn't you leave lunch
by the side of the road?

04:35.809 --> 04:38.644
It's old news. I think
it was just a passing thing.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.946
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.723
Ah!

04:53.393 --> 04:54.993
So now what?

04:59.599 --> 05:02.601
What is the worst thing
that you've ever done?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.037
-Truth or dare?
-Sure.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.639
Like, the meanest, most rotten,
horrible, dirtiest,

05:07.641 --> 05:10.942
dishonorable, despicable thing
that you've ever done.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.379
I took the five finger discount
on these back in Santa fe.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.716
--Is that not what you meant?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.385
-What about you?
-What?

05:22.355 --> 05:23.922
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.391
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

05:30.897 --> 05:34.466
My mum's sister, Polly,

05:34.468 --> 05:36.401
died in a car accident
when I was really young

05:36.403 --> 05:40.539
and her son Wayne was in the car
with her but didn't die. He...

05:40.541 --> 05:42.507
He kind of turned into
this vegetable.

05:42.509 --> 05:48.647
So... Wayne kind of
became my doll.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.782
I would dress him up
in my mom's clothes

05:50.784 --> 05:52.684
and plaster his face
with make-up

05:52.686 --> 05:56.088
and I would put on these little
plays with him as the star.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.459
I really shouldn't
have been watching him,

06:00.461 --> 06:03.929
but I mean, there was, like,
no one else. So...

06:03.931 --> 06:07.032
I mean, I was so young
and he kind of sickened me.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.769
I mean, he smelt, particularly
when he took a shit.

06:10.771 --> 06:15.374
He just constantly had this
drool running down his face.

06:15.376 --> 06:20.779
So... I kind of started
fucking with him.

06:23.583 --> 06:28.653
I drew a bull's-eye on his head
with a red lipstick

06:28.655 --> 06:33.425
and I would throw soft fruit
at him, like target practice.

06:33.427 --> 06:37.062
And when he shat himself I would
just wheel him into a closet

06:37.064 --> 06:40.932
and leave him there all day
until my mom came home.

06:42.602 --> 06:46.905
And I was, like, a girl
interested in sex and boys.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.677
I would take off
all of Wayne's clothes

06:52.679 --> 06:58.850
and, one day, I put
peanut butter, like, all over

06:58.852 --> 07:01.686
and just let the dog
come and lick it up.

07:01.688 --> 07:05.157
And then I would kind of jerk
him off and watch him get hard.

07:07.693 --> 07:11.830
And... I mean,
at the end of the day,

07:11.832 --> 07:14.866
he was covered with whatever
i threw and I dumped on him,

07:14.868 --> 07:19.805
and I would just wheel him
outside and just hose him down.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.206
And if it was raining,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.742
I would just leave him out there
for hours.

07:29.849 --> 07:35.053
And then I would wash him
sometimes in the kiddie pool.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.757
And I would just let him
slip in the water

07:38.759 --> 07:42.060
until there were no bubbles
or anything

07:42.062 --> 07:45.630
and his face would be, like,
red and purple and...

07:47.800 --> 07:52.070
And then, you know, I would
save him just at the right time.

07:55.942 --> 07:59.044
My mom had a boyfriend, this
Gulf war vet, complete asshole.

07:59.046 --> 08:03.048
We were all watching TV one
night and he mentioned how...

08:03.050 --> 08:06.685
Wayne was doing really weird
things with his eyeballs.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.722
Wayne's dad was a marine.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.060
It turns out he was doing
morse code with his eyes.

08:18.531 --> 08:23.635
He was saying,
"sos, sos, sos, sos."

08:23.637 --> 08:27.072
I mean, over and over and over.

08:45.992 --> 08:49.160
Oh, my god.
Do you see what I just did?

08:49.162 --> 08:52.130
That is the worst thing
that I've ever done.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.699
Ah... oh.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.636
Let's go get a real drink.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.171
Yeah, let's get
out of this room.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.844
<i> It's a hard road</i>
<i> we've got to travel.</i>

11:19.846 --> 11:23.114
<i> It's a road that is</i>
<i> not fit for them</i>

11:23.116 --> 11:25.350
<i> who want to take</i>
<i> the easiest route.</i>

11:25.352 --> 11:28.319
<i> Because the easiest route</i>
<i> has been paved smooth</i>

11:28.321 --> 11:32.190
<i> by the tramplings</i>
<i> of sin and perdition.</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:35.827
<i> No, the road we travel with</i>
<i> Jesus is a road that's uneven.</i>

11:35.829 --> 11:38.997
<i> It's a road that's not to be</i>
<i> chosen by its even-ness,</i>

11:38.999 --> 11:41.700
<i> by its length.</i>
<i> It's a road that's chosen</i>

11:41.702 --> 11:44.335
<i> by virtue of its destination.</i>

11:44.337 --> 11:46.104
<i> Of where we're going.</i>

11:46.106 --> 11:48.173
<i> Of where we're all going.</i>

11:52.945 --> 11:54.813
Scarlett?

11:56.282 --> 11:57.816
What are you doing?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.851
Did you turn on the TV?

12:07.493 --> 12:09.461
Are you crying?

12:12.131 --> 12:14.132
I thought I heard someone.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.836
I'm just hearing...

12:19.171 --> 12:20.872
Who? Who are you talking about?

12:20.874 --> 12:23.742
I heard someone talking to me
in the room.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.046
There's no one in here.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.083
You're probably still sick,

12:32.085 --> 12:35.920
and all that Tequila,
don't you think?

12:39.391 --> 12:41.392
Yeah.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.294
Come to bed.

12:44.797 --> 12:45.964
Ok.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.291
Hey! Was that you last night?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.327
You were looking up at our room.

13:21.133 --> 13:25.236
Hey, let's shake a tail.
La is not gonna drive to us.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.816
How are you not hung over?

13:37.818 --> 13:42.086
Desrt air? Good genes?
I don't know.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.894
<i> They don't want you</i>
<i> to know the truth.</i>

14:22.896 --> 14:25.330
<i> No, that fork-tongued</i>
<i> speaker of calumny</i>

14:25.332 --> 14:27.265
<i> shall rassle you down...</i>

14:27.267 --> 14:30.134
Check it out. You think that's
the asshole who woke me up?

14:30.136 --> 14:32.170
<i> Everything that you thought</i>
<i> was rued shall recede!</i>

14:32.172 --> 14:34.639
We shall be rassled down!

14:34.641 --> 14:37.242
<i> The walls that keep you,</i>
<i> the woman beside you...</i>

14:37.244 --> 14:39.043
God, it's beautiful.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.380
Scarlett.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.884
-Scarlett?
-Ah!

14:45.886 --> 14:47.886
Scarlett.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.558
-Can you turn around?
-What?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.160
Stop the car! Stop!

15:02.235 --> 15:04.936
What is it? What's going on?

15:04.938 --> 15:07.038
I don't know, it's like I feel
like I'm being crushed

15:07.040 --> 15:08.573
and then...

15:10.309 --> 15:13.678
...like, then next I'm falling
1,000 feet from the sky.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.081
We... we need a doctor.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.220
I don't think
there's a doctor for this.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.955
What do you mean?

15:26.592 --> 15:30.028
I think we just have to go back.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.463
What?
Let's make it to the next town.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.400
No, the further away I get,
the worse it gets.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.370
- Further--

15:40.306 --> 15:41.973
shit.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.610
Please.

15:50.549 --> 15:53.017
Ok, I'm turning around.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.447
Isn't that the church
from the TV?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.616
Go. Drive.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.151
Drive! Go!

16:43.102 --> 16:45.203
I'm sorry, ok?

16:46.271 --> 16:48.473
I don't know what to say.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.454
Is there anything
i can do to help?

17:03.456 --> 17:06.290
No. I think I just need to rest.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.794
Ok.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.662
You rest, I'll just sit here
until you fall asleep.

17:11.664 --> 17:15.333
No, you don't have to do that.
It's sweet. You should just go.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.336
Go downstairs, have a beer.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.471
Go on, go. I need to sleep.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.674
I don't feel good.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.501
El rancho?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.570
Hang on a second.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.674
It's for you.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.814
Hello?

18:02.816 --> 18:05.550
<i> Alex.</i>

18:05.552 --> 18:06.751
Hello?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.486
<i> Alex.</i>

18:10.222 --> 18:11.756
Scarlett?

18:29.208 --> 18:31.275
I think I know him.

18:33.145 --> 18:36.881
Who? The guy on TV?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.683
I know how it sounds.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.351
Scarlett.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.854
I think he's trying
to tell me something.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.690
Something important.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.592
<i>Jesus, I forgive my children...</i>

18:47.594 --> 18:49.393
Alex...

18:55.868 --> 18:58.603
I don't know why
i feel so crazy.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.906
I just feel like
i know this town.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.409
So let's just go.
Let's get out of here.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.346
We'll be in la by morning.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.658
Ok.

19:42.481 --> 19:45.550
-Scarlett?
-Oh, Alex.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.291
Oh, my head.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.693
It feels like
it's going to explode.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.830
Scarlett, just...

20:15.847 --> 20:17.582
We have to go back.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.394
I don't want you to worry.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.631
We're going to find a doctor
tomorrow for you.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.601
Call someone and get someone
to come out here and pick us up.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.577
Promise me.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.780
We'll get out of here tomorrow.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.955
Promise.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.735
<i> Front desk,</i>
<i> can I help you?</i>

22:50.737 --> 22:52.036
Hello. I wanted to see
if I had any messages.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.105
<i> Hello? Hello?</i>

22:54.107 --> 22:56.006
--Hello?

23:36.782 --> 23:38.849
Scarlett?

23:53.832 --> 23:56.734
- Hello?
<i>- You only lost your girl.</i>

23:58.603 --> 24:01.105
<i> Well, I tell you what.</i>

24:01.107 --> 24:04.141
<i> It seems only right</i>
<i> I should help you find her.</i>

24:04.143 --> 24:06.944
-Who is this? What the fuck?
<i> -What a thing to say.</i>

24:06.946 --> 24:10.548
<i> Here I am,</i>
<i> trying to be neighborly.</i>

24:10.550 --> 24:12.716
<i> I may be the only one</i>
<i> who understands you</i>

24:12.718 --> 24:15.219
<i> -in this godforsaken town.</i>
-I don't know who you are or--

24:15.221 --> 24:19.590
<i> just a man, Alex.</i>

24:19.592 --> 24:21.659
What do you want? Tell me.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.162
<i>Let's start with you telling me</i>
<i> your particulars.</i>

24:25.164 --> 24:27.198
<i> -What does she look like?</i>
-What?

24:29.735 --> 24:33.103
<i> I hear she's a real looker.</i>

24:33.105 --> 24:36.574
<i> Don't let the red cross</i>
<i> fool you.</i>

24:36.576 --> 24:39.143
<i> She ain't fit to...</i>
<i> ...Of the lord.</i>

24:40.712 --> 24:43.214
<i> Of course,</i>
<i> maybe she's sleepwalking,</i>

24:43.216 --> 24:46.550
<i> like a detached witness,</i>
<i> as if she's watching a movie</i>

24:46.552 --> 24:48.652
<i> or listening to the radio.</i>

24:48.654 --> 24:50.821
<i> Is that girl a sleepwalker,</i>
<i> Alex?</i>

24:50.823 --> 24:52.690
Where are you?

24:52.692 --> 24:55.493
<i> In there.</i>

24:55.495 --> 24:58.028
In where?
<i> -In there.</i>

24:59.231 --> 25:00.664
<i> With you.</i>

26:34.626 --> 26:36.827
Lose something?

26:36.829 --> 26:40.998
No, sir, I just thought
I'd take myself a little look.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.970
You know, sometimes I hear
even the mouse chases the cat.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.938
Fucking mouse.

26:47.940 --> 26:52.242
I tell you what, why don't
we go for a little drive?

27:08.193 --> 27:11.061
Are you starting
to feel it then?

27:15.233 --> 27:18.202
You're taking me to Scarlett.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.404
That's where you're taking me,
isn't it?

27:20.406 --> 27:26.677
Hey! Schilter!
How about you put on that radio?

27:26.679 --> 27:30.047
Let's hear some of that
good old spiritual music.

27:47.766 --> 27:51.068
They sure don't make songs
like they used to.

28:24.936 --> 28:27.905
It's louder because
they know we're here.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.876
All this time
and they never give up.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.712
Who? Who are you talking about?

28:34.714 --> 28:38.182
Well, that's the real story
right there.

28:38.184 --> 28:41.385
Well, I never really took
to people much.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.153
That's just the truth.

28:43.155 --> 28:47.024
But I didn't like to be
all by my lonesome either.

28:47.026 --> 28:50.828
So I found people of my choosing
and I took them out here.

28:50.830 --> 28:54.765
What I do first is I dig a hole,
a nice deep hole,

28:54.767 --> 28:57.334
and I make them watch
as I dig it.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.069
And then I take the person.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.939
Let's say it's you,
or your girlfriend.

29:01.941 --> 29:07.411
Let's say it's Scarlett, and
i take her, just for instance.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.082
And I throw her in the hole
and I bury her.

29:12.084 --> 29:16.420
I bury her alive
and she never ever dies.

29:16.422 --> 29:21.825
She lives for all eternity
under a heavy darkness of dirt,

29:21.827 --> 29:24.962
reaping what she sowed.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.273
-This is impossible.
-Impossible?

29:36.275 --> 29:40.944
Just ask them.
They all have a story.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.946
Hundreds of them.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.915
Thousands.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.017
Oh...

29:47.019 --> 29:51.555
A city of pain under our feet.

29:51.557 --> 29:55.459
Oh, pain's a beautiful thing.

29:55.461 --> 30:00.030
In the end, it's the only thing
we really deserve.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.970
<i> It is only due</i>
<i> to the concept of guilt</i>

30:06.972 --> 30:10.440
<i> we allow ourselves to see</i>
<i> ourselves as imperfect.</i>

30:10.442 --> 30:13.977
<i> Our ego depends on guilt</i>
<i>for its survival as it allows us</i>

30:13.979 --> 30:16.480
<i> to separate the world into</i>
<i> different objects</i>

30:16.482 --> 30:19.416
<i> which we then call</i>
<i> "good" and "evil."</i>

30:19.418 --> 30:23.153
<i> There is no good and evil.</i>
<i> There is only perfection.</i>

31:19.310 --> 31:22.246
<i> Father, I'm gonna thank you</i>

31:22.248 --> 31:25.182
<i> for your son Jesus</i>
<i> who died on the cross for me.</i>

31:25.184 --> 31:31.255
<i> For my sins, not only for</i>
<i> my sins, but for my fears.</i>

31:31.257 --> 31:34.558
<i>I'm gonna thank you for your son</i>
<i> Jesus who makes me whole,</i>

31:34.560 --> 31:39.630
<i> in my spirit, in my body,</i>
<i> in my soul.</i>

31:39.632 --> 31:42.199
<i> I want to thank you, father,</i>
<i> for your son Jesus</i>

31:42.201 --> 31:45.235
<i> who helped me sever the ties</i>
<i> between previous generations,</i>

31:45.237 --> 31:48.672
<i> -from that bad blood...</i>
- Hello.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.441
I'm the whole operation,

31:51.443 --> 31:54.978
so I need to loop it
if I want to take a break.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.918
Want coffee?

32:03.054 --> 32:06.490
When slocum sailed the world...

32:10.596 --> 32:14.698
He'd tie himself to the masthead
when he wanted to sleep.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.134
Me, I got no such methods, no.

32:19.170 --> 32:22.339
My work is my word,
it cannot be rigged up.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.010
Whiskey in your coffee?

32:27.012 --> 32:28.612
What is this place?

32:28.614 --> 32:31.148
Well, if I say it's a church
then it's a church.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.983
If I say I speak to god

32:32.985 --> 32:36.019
then there is a god
that is spoken to.

32:38.022 --> 32:40.057
There was a man.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.392
Dirty hands, rings.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.228
This smile.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.597
Smile, well, that's a crime.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.232
There's the thin wedge.

32:49.234 --> 32:53.236
It was cut into his face
like with a knife.

32:53.238 --> 32:57.174
You're talking about
the angel of the bottomless pit.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.345
That's an ordinarily fella
with the wretched odor

33:01.347 --> 33:04.081
of a million painful deaths
on him.

33:07.151 --> 33:11.722
But pain...
Is a beautiful thing.

33:16.294 --> 33:20.464
In the end, that's all we got.

33:22.233 --> 33:25.369
You're gonna have to excuse me
for just a spot, son.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.070
Have a look around.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.573
But do your best to keep quiet.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.275
Do me a favor,
hit that record switch for me.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.544
Spare me the indignity
of having my audience see me

33:34.546 --> 33:36.346
scurry up onto my own set.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.348
Son, I promise you,

33:38.350 --> 33:41.218
we will get back to
our conversation momentarily.

33:41.220 --> 33:45.055
But first, the work of the lord,
then the work of man, alright?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.725
Hit the button.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.134
And just as soon as
that there sun shines down

33:57.136 --> 33:59.336
with its warmth and light
on all things equally,

33:59.338 --> 34:02.806
so too will guilt enwrap you
like a plague.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.676
And drown you in sorrow.

34:06.678 --> 34:11.481
Now, when we imagine things, we
start creating them in our mind.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.117
We open the door
to our hearts...

34:16.587 --> 34:19.589
Open your mind and then...

34:19.591 --> 34:21.792
You must be very careful
about what things

34:21.793 --> 34:24.293
you allow yourself to focus on,

34:24.295 --> 34:26.063
lest they become real.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.398
Lest the ethereal becomes poor.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.268
Lest your fantasy
becomes reality.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.137
You have to avoid these things.

34:34.139 --> 34:37.607
There is Satan waiting to open
the door to your heart

34:37.609 --> 34:41.511
and walk in. So you have to be
very careful about the images

34:41.513 --> 34:43.346
you allow yourself to focus on.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.715
And it's like one moment
you're being crushed,

34:45.717 --> 34:50.320
and the next you're falling from
1,000 feet up in the sky.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.589
I don't know, it's like
i feel I'm being crushed

34:52.591 --> 34:56.426
and the next I'm falling,
like, 1,000 feet from the sky.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.631
-Hey, what are you doing?
-How do you know what she said?

35:01.633 --> 35:03.233
You can't just interrupt me

35:03.235 --> 35:05.602
-mid-sermon.
-Why is this here?

35:08.272 --> 35:09.706
What is this?

35:09.708 --> 35:12.275
It's a mememto.
It's all I have left of her,

35:12.277 --> 35:14.511
-so mind how you handle it.
-Is she here?

35:14.513 --> 35:18.348
Scarlett? Scarlett?

35:18.350 --> 35:20.617
I'm the only one who's here,
Alex.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.552
How do you know my name?

35:22.554 --> 35:25.222
A better question would be:
Why wouldn't I know your name?

35:25.224 --> 35:27.757
You've been running around with
my daughter, haven't you?

35:27.759 --> 35:29.459
Daughter?

35:30.828 --> 35:33.296
Scarlett's father is dead.

35:35.433 --> 35:39.136
She told you that?

35:39.138 --> 35:42.873
Well, that cuts the
patriarch right to the quick.

35:44.675 --> 35:48.278
I don't say
i don't deserve it, though.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.614
It's true I knocked her around
a time or two.

35:51.716 --> 35:52.682
But...

35:57.722 --> 36:01.791
My tiddling is strictly
medicinal now, you understand.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.730
Bingo.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.633
Here.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.279
It ain't there, son.

36:26.417 --> 36:28.251
There you go. Hold still, son.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.288
You can't die
if you ain't alive.

36:32.456 --> 36:33.657
What did you say?

36:38.563 --> 36:40.497
This is hell.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.866
-We're in hell, aren't we?
-No.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.869
I'm dead. We're all dead.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.206
People tend to focus on
the world that's around them

36:49.208 --> 36:52.409
rather than the world
that's within them.

36:52.411 --> 36:55.645
- Oh!

36:55.647 --> 36:57.981
--Tell me what this is.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.717
-It's murder, if you do this.
-No!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.519
--Tell me what this is!

37:02.521 --> 37:04.955
--God damnit, I don't know!

37:04.957 --> 37:06.523
--Ow, fuck!

37:06.525 --> 37:10.327
No, ok, ok, ok, it's a dream.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.395
-There we go.
-I'm dreaming all of this.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.997
No!

37:13.999 --> 37:16.399
No, the divine plan
is in play here, son.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.802
You can either take charge
and fight your way through it,

37:18.804 --> 37:21.972
or you can continue to be
a pansy ass spectator.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.307
What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be?!

37:24.309 --> 37:26.309
-I don't know.
-Enjoy the ride.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.677
--No, I don't understand!

37:27.679 --> 37:29.279
You said this is all a dream.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.748
Yes, it is all a dream.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.384
But you ain't dreaming nothing.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.854
Scarlett is.

38:56.801 --> 38:58.601
Hey.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.337
Sit down.

39:11.615 --> 39:14.584
You ok, honey?

39:14.586 --> 39:15.785
Uh-huh.

39:16.854 --> 39:20.490
I have so much to do today.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.559
I have to go buy Isabella a gift

39:22.561 --> 39:25.695
and then I have to go get
a manicure and pedicure.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.864
But they messed up
the appointment

39:27.866 --> 39:31.534
so I'm supposed to go there
for 4:30 but...

39:37.508 --> 39:39.109
That's it.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.929
Get that, hon?

40:06.971 --> 40:09.005
Hey.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.975
What, are you not gonna
let me in?

40:11.977 --> 40:14.978
What are you doing?
Where have you been?

40:14.980 --> 40:17.914
Hey, you don't answer your phone
calls, no email, nothing.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.450
Jensen's pissed.
And I saved your ass.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.685
I talked to the rancho clients
myself, fuck you very much.

40:22.687 --> 40:26.623
-Clients? What clients?
-What are you talking about?

40:27.958 --> 40:30.827
You said rancho?
What do you mean?

40:30.829 --> 40:32.629
What do you mean,
"what do I mean?"

40:32.631 --> 40:35.064
You just said rancho.
What is rancho?

40:35.066 --> 40:37.434
El rancho estates.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.701
The deal we've been
putting together

40:38.703 --> 40:40.603
for the last four
fucking months.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.907
What's going on here, Alex?
Are you ok?

40:43.909 --> 40:47.177
Paige, is he ok?

40:47.179 --> 40:50.513
Hey, come on, man,
i was just trying-- Alex!

41:08.232 --> 41:10.233
Alex?

41:12.970 --> 41:14.237
What are you doing?

41:15.906 --> 41:16.639
Come to bed.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.013
<i> It's time now for</i>
<i> your national forecast...</i>

41:31.722 --> 41:33.256
Easy.

41:35.059 --> 41:38.728
You want me to get you
in the mood?

41:38.730 --> 41:41.498
Relax, Alex.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.504
Forget about everything else.

41:47.506 --> 41:48.872
What do you mean,
everything else?

42:01.252 --> 42:04.053
What the fuck, Alex?

42:10.995 --> 42:14.931
<i> For all the wrongs we have</i>
<i> committed to one another.</i>

42:14.933 --> 42:20.770
<i>It is the single act of kindness</i>
<i> that god requires of us.</i>

43:28.772 --> 43:31.074
<i> You're looking</i>
<i> for a room, sir?</i>

43:31.076 --> 43:32.775
<i> Can't do much better.</i>

43:32.777 --> 43:35.178
<i> And if you can,</i>
<i> I dare you to find it.</i>

43:35.180 --> 43:37.947
<i> I wonder,</i>
<i> could I ask you a question?</i>

43:37.949 --> 43:40.083
<i> No harm in it.</i>

43:40.085 --> 43:42.385
<i> It might sound strange.</i>

43:43.821 --> 43:46.289
Do I look familiar to you
at all?

43:53.263 --> 43:56.699
Couldn't say.
All you young people look alike.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.837
-I might have been with a girl.
-Pretty one?

44:00.839 --> 44:03.139
Yeah.

44:03.141 --> 44:06.809
No. If I saw you,
it didn't stick with me.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.812
Ok. A room then.

45:08.105 --> 45:11.240
<i> Does anything</i>
<i> ever happen here?</i>

45:11.242 --> 45:14.377
<i> I drove all this way and when</i>
<i>I got here everything was wrong.</i>

45:14.379 --> 45:17.146
<i> Do you know what that's like,</i>
<i> to drive all this way</i>

45:17.148 --> 45:20.950
and have it not be
what it should be?

45:20.952 --> 45:23.352
No, I can't say as I do.

45:54.351 --> 45:56.252
Where is it?

45:59.089 --> 46:01.224
Where is it?

46:05.195 --> 46:07.196
Where is it?

46:33.357 --> 46:35.391
Come on now, get up.

46:36.827 --> 46:38.961
I won't say it again.

46:44.368 --> 46:47.570
Now, you can't do that.
This is not a campsite.

46:50.541 --> 46:54.343
Fine. Just tell me where it is.

46:54.345 --> 46:56.112
-You just get on out of here.
-I'm going.

46:56.114 --> 46:59.182
-Just tell me where it went.
-Where what went?

47:00.184 --> 47:02.018
The church.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.586
There was a church here.

47:03.588 --> 47:06.122
Couldn't have been too long ago.

47:06.124 --> 47:08.825
The church of
the solid rock sufferer.

47:08.827 --> 47:12.228
There's no place like that
around here. Not here.

47:12.230 --> 47:14.163
-You've got to be--
-I've got to be nothing.

47:17.367 --> 47:20.369
People tend to focus on
the world around them,

47:20.371 --> 47:22.538
rather than the world
within them.

47:24.274 --> 47:27.076
Now, you just drive on
out of here.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.013
Ok.

48:58.235 --> 48:59.402
Alex?

49:00.237 --> 49:02.405
What the fuck?

49:02.407 --> 49:06.175
You just leave
in the middle of the night?

49:06.177 --> 49:09.211
For, what, a day and a half?
You don't bother calling me,

49:09.213 --> 49:11.213
-nothing?
-Sorry.

49:11.215 --> 49:14.083
Oh, my god. It's fucked up
but the only reason why

49:14.085 --> 49:16.218
I didn't call the police is
because you have been acting

49:16.220 --> 49:18.454
so strange lately.

49:18.456 --> 49:21.324
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

49:21.326 --> 49:25.294
That it didn't faze me
that you just left like that.

49:27.397 --> 49:30.299
-What are you doing?
-Looking.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.968
For what?

50:43.573 --> 50:47.476
Scarlett. Where'd you go?

50:52.649 --> 50:54.617
Why are you acting
like you don't know me?

51:01.458 --> 51:03.292
Hey.

55:33.596 --> 55:35.597
What are you doing?

55:36.433 --> 55:38.334
I can't explain it.

55:41.638 --> 55:43.906
Why don't you give it a try?

55:46.710 --> 55:51.447
It's an idea I had.
I was at the grocry store.

55:51.449 --> 55:55.651
I knocked over a carton of eggs
and I saw this bloody yolk.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.620
You were buying eggs
at two in the morning?

56:00.523 --> 56:04.360
It got me thinking
about some peas.

56:05.829 --> 56:07.463
You hate peas.

56:07.465 --> 56:08.831
Well, I was looking at them.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.599
I was looking for something.

56:10.601 --> 56:14.870
I looked at them
and most of them are perfect.

56:14.872 --> 56:17.373
Bright color, firm, good size.

56:17.375 --> 56:20.609
But then I found
this rotten one in the can.

56:22.479 --> 56:26.014
Now, if, say I was dreaming...

56:26.016 --> 56:31.653
I know how that sounds, but
let's just say I was dreaming.

56:31.655 --> 56:34.022
Do you really think that
my mind would take the time

56:34.024 --> 56:37.092
to put a rotten pea in there?
I mean, think about it.

56:37.094 --> 56:39.094
When you think about a pea,
what do you think of?

56:39.096 --> 56:42.498
A fresh pea, right?
A normal pea. Don't you?

56:42.500 --> 56:45.968
I really don't think about peas,
Alex.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.936
It's not really you,
it's your subconscious.

56:47.938 --> 56:49.772
Do you really think
the part of you that dreams

56:49.774 --> 56:51.640
is gonna put a rotten pea
in a can?

56:52.942 --> 56:56.111
Don't answer that. Just look.

56:58.114 --> 57:02.718
If I was in a dream, why would
that one bad pea be in there?

57:05.656 --> 57:07.756
I'm gonna go to bed.

58:00.243 --> 58:02.211
Paige?

58:18.061 --> 58:19.962
Alex?

58:23.533 --> 58:24.666
Alex.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.204
What's going on?

58:37.247 --> 58:39.248
I don't know.

58:40.149 --> 58:41.984
Are you ok?

58:43.553 --> 58:45.587
Are you ok?

58:47.957 --> 58:50.192
-No.
-Alex.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.961
Talk to me.

58:52.963 --> 58:54.963
Talk to me, please.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.298
Tell me what's happening.

59:00.637 --> 59:02.804
My head's not right anymore.

59:04.007 --> 59:07.576
I'm... I'm all over the place.

59:07.578 --> 59:08.877
Distracted. I'm...

59:10.813 --> 59:15.117
I'm obsessed with this idea
that I don't think I exist.

59:17.687 --> 59:20.622
I don't think you
or any of this is real.

59:23.259 --> 59:25.127
How long have you felt this way?

59:27.163 --> 59:30.732
I wake up and I feel like
I'm still in a dream.

59:30.734 --> 59:33.969
If you're...
If you're dreaming all of this--

59:33.971 --> 59:38.006
-I'm not dreaming this.
-But you just said that.

59:38.008 --> 59:42.644
No, no. It's worse than that.

59:44.781 --> 59:47.883
I think someone else
is dreaming this.

59:47.885 --> 59:51.620
But, Alex, how can we be
in someone else's dream

59:51.622 --> 59:54.790
if you're here?

59:54.792 --> 59:57.059
If she dies in this world,
then she wakes up.

59:57.061 --> 59:59.928
Wait. If who dies?

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.264
And if she wakes up,
then we're...

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:05.901
Alex, this is real.

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:08.971
This is real, you and me.
Nothing else matters.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:12.040
Just ignore whatever's
going on out there.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:14.309
Look, stay here with me.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:18.313
Ok, you need this.
This is your home.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.182
I love you.

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:24.052
And you love me.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.259
Paige?

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:15.263
What are you doing?

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.801
I was thirsty.
What are you doing?

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.407
Getting something to eat.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:30.345
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:35.350
When did we meet?

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:38.453
That is such a silly question.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.056
We met yesterday. I'm your wife?

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.428
I love you.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.968
Don't be too long.

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:36.458
You can come out now.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.634
We can just skip
the formalities.

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:47.736
I know what you want.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.138
Scarlett.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.281
You know me.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.517
You know all about me.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.020
Yeah.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:07.288
I saw you at the supermarket.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.792
You're my neighbor.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.131
That's not what I mean.

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:18.066
Tell me you remember me.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.569
No.

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.709
Why don't you remind me.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.748
We're in love.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.619
If you want it, just take it.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:40.588
You don't have to ask me
if it's ok.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.591
-What are you talking about?
-You came here to rape me.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.563
I know what you want.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:53.268
You can say her name
if you want to.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:57.539
You want to...
Call out her name?

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.376
Scarlett.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.681
I can be Scarlett
if you want me to be Scarlett.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.125
No. No.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.729
No, you can't leave.

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.631
You're not going anywhere!

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:24.832
Fuck.

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:28.670
What is this? Who is this?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.307
You both know who I am.

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.309
What the fuck is wrong with you
people? Why are you lying?

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.344
He's been watching me
across the street for weeks.

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.745
I think he was
trying to rape me.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.682
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.787
Don't!

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.158
Stop!

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.632
Do you know where you are?

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:12.767
Do you remember this place?

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.877
You remember him? What happened?

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.414
Where is he?

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.518
Where?

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.720
My cousin, he's...

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.624
But who knows?

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.860
Maybe it was for the best.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:42.030
I mean, can you imagine the
kind of life he would have had?

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:47.068
It was the fire pit, wasn't it?
That's where you put him.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.575
And this is your house.
This is where you grew up.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:56.744
And the fire pit,
you tell me about that.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.047
You tell me about
when you put him in there.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:05.586
Tell me. Tell me.

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.090
Tell me!

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:10.792
Tell me!

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:11.993
Tell me!

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.995
Tell me!

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.683
Do you know what this is?

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.886
Is this him?

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:15.757
His bones buried for years
in this exact place.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.792
Come on, Alex.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:19.527
We both know
how this is gonna end.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.829
Can't we just skip all of this?

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:28.703
No!

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.505
I remember.

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.941
How can that be possible?

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.011
How can I remember?

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:40.415
How can I remember
the dirt falling in on me?

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:43.951
You dropped him... me.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:45.686
...into the hole.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:49.924
Until there was only my face
and my fingertips.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.928
And then the rain came,
pellets of it. Bullet-sized.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.732
Do you remember?
You remember, don't you?

01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:01.936
It filled my lungs and my throat
with mud.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:03.738
Even if I wasn't paralyzed,

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.007
there was no fighting
against it.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:08.643
There was nothing I could do.

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:10.478
Look at me!

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.213
I want you to know
what happened to me.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:15.016
Do you know what happened to me?

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.453
He died, of course.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.655
First there was fear.

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:24.992
And in those last few seconds,
i knew I would die.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:28.095
I felt my body slip away.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.932
I saw the world darken.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:35.736
I felt the weight of that mud
pressing down on me.

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:40.475
And my heart beat so fast
until it just collapsed.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.645
And I left myself.

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:54.121
Don't you know that you're the
one that I've been waiting for

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:55.890
all of this time?

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.628
Now pick up the shovel.
Pick it up!

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.131
Pick up the shovel!

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.869
Go on.

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:09.737
Just take it.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:16.511
Can't you see that
you're nothing anymore?

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:19.814
You're not Alex.
You're not some hooded man.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:21.916
You're not the little boy
that I killed.

01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:24.986
-Shut up.
-You don't even exist.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:30.758
You're only good for one thing,
and you know it.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.927
So just do it.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.232
Just hit me.

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.536
What?

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:50.978
Just do it. Hit me.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.614
-I deserve it.
-Shut up.

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:55.750
I deserve it. I want it.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.718
-I want it, Alex.
-No.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.186
-Hit me!
-Shut up.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.956
No.

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:04.825
You know,
if you really were him...

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:10.264
If you really were Wayne,

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:13.634
I'd watch you drown 1,000 times.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:17.004
Every night I would beat you
and cut you

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:21.008
and drag you into another hole.
And I'd watch you,

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:25.813
and your eyes, your wild eyes,
as earth spills in on you.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:30.284
And you'd finally understand
that this is it. This is it!

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:34.088
And I'm the one
who's kneeling in front of you,

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.890
filling your grave
with laughter.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:38.159
-Stop it.
-And I would say it again

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:41.796
and again and again.
A man in a hood

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:45.700
came and broke in
and he threw you into a hole,

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:48.636
-and then he raped me.
-Shut up.

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:50.838
It was so easy.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.075
It was so easy and
they would all comfort me.

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:57.144
And they would make me feel
so much better.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:00.848
And they would never know
that you could never die

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.284
-enough for me.
-Shut up!

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.207
"<i> I know now</i>
<i> I must be accountable</i>

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:29.276
<i> for my unspeakable actions.</i>

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:33.214
<i> "And don't worry, just death</i>
<i> comes to all things.</i>

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:36.817
<i> "Flesh, blood, bone...</i>

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:39.286
<i> Are all just temporal.</i>

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:43.724
<i> "Rock lasts forever.</i>

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:47.762
<i> "Which is where</i>
<i> my spirit will reside.</i>

01:17:47.764 --> 01:17:50.698
<i> "I love you. Scarlett."</i>

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.358
Alex.
