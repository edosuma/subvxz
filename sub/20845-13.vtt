WEBVTT

00:00.188 --> 00:03.474
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.475 --> 00:05.476
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Hey. Oh.

00:05.477 --> 00:07.177
Cashews.

00:07.178 --> 00:09.650
The caviar of nuts.

00:09.651 --> 00:11.185
Ah-ah-ah.

00:11.186 --> 00:14.521
The cashews are for when
Bobby's new girlfriend gets here.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.523
We don't want this girl dumping Bobby

00:16.524 --> 00:20.694
because his parents
didn't serve quality nuts.

00:20.695 --> 00:22.142
But I'm starving.

00:22.143 --> 00:24.140
Well, eat these saltines, baby.

00:24.141 --> 00:25.909
- Saltines?
- Mm-hmm.

00:25.910 --> 00:29.145
These are what you
serve pigeons and ducks.

00:29.146 --> 00:33.650
This is the food you're
supposed to eat off the ground.

00:33.651 --> 00:35.719
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, guys.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.154
Oh, y'all got cashews? You know,
those are the caviar of nuts.

00:38.155 --> 00:40.757
Nobody is getting any cashews

00:40.758 --> 00:42.726
until Bobby's new girlfriend gets here.

00:42.727 --> 00:45.729
You know, I never actually
saw cashews as that fancy.

00:45.730 --> 00:48.465
I always considered the
fanciest nut to be the pistachio.

00:48.466 --> 00:50.767
Hmm.

00:50.768 --> 00:53.203
Speaking of amazing, fancy things,

00:53.204 --> 00:55.004
we have something to show you.

00:55.006 --> 00:56.606
Since we got married

00:56.607 --> 00:58.575
without me getting Maxine
an engagement ring...

00:58.576 --> 00:59.809
Look: I went all out.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.044
Oh.

01:01.045 --> 01:03.079
Maxine, why is your diamond red?

01:03.080 --> 01:05.114
Is it stained?

01:05.116 --> 01:07.617
It's not a diamond, it's a ruby.

01:07.618 --> 01:09.403
- A ruby?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.404 --> 01:11.249
Why would you buy something
that tells everyone

01:11.250 --> 01:12.617
you can't afford a diamond?

01:12.618 --> 01:15.720
Rubies are actually more
expensive than diamonds.

01:15.722 --> 01:18.857
Really? 'Cause it looks like a Ring Pop.

01:18.858 --> 01:22.494
Cynthia, the diamond trade
is vicious and destructive.

01:22.495 --> 01:24.129
So if you see a diamond on a ring,

01:24.130 --> 01:26.331
that means somebody in
Africa died to get that.

01:26.332 --> 01:28.533
Oh. Well, if the ring is in the store,

01:28.534 --> 01:32.804
then whoever got the
diamond is already dead.

01:32.805 --> 01:35.674
So you're saying you want these Africans

01:35.675 --> 01:37.709
to have died for nothing?

01:38.511 --> 01:40.412
Yeah, Maxine.

01:40.413 --> 01:41.713
You're always telling us to recycle,

01:41.714 --> 01:44.783
and here you're wasting dead Africans.

01:44.784 --> 01:46.718
Don't worry.

01:46.719 --> 01:49.921
I'm sure somebody somewhere
died for this ruby, too.

01:49.922 --> 01:51.523
So, look. Did Bobby tell you anything

01:51.524 --> 01:53.191
about this new girl of his?

01:53.192 --> 01:55.494
- Uh-uh.
- Nothing. Just that she's great.

01:55.495 --> 01:57.729
Okay. So let me get this straight.

01:57.730 --> 02:02.467
There's a great girl that's
interested in our Bobby?

02:02.468 --> 02:06.571
This is very suspicious.

02:06.572 --> 02:10.175
So what y'all thinking?
Albino, alopecia, or just slow?

02:10.175 --> 02:11.910
Oh, look. They're here.

02:11.911 --> 02:14.546
I don't care how pale,
bald or dumb she is,

02:14.547 --> 02:16.715
you know, Bobby has
been struggling lately,

02:16.716 --> 02:18.950
and we just need to
give him some support.

02:18.951 --> 02:20.519
Come on, Joe, get up.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.853
Oh. What up, y'all?

02:21.854 --> 02:23.855
This is my girlfriend, Janet.

02:23.856 --> 02:26.358
Hey, everyone.

02:26.359 --> 02:27.692
Oh.

02:27.693 --> 02:30.462
- Hey, hey, Janet.
- Hi, Janet.

02:30.463 --> 02:31.963
I am so sorry.

02:31.964 --> 02:33.532
I hate to be rude,

02:33.533 --> 02:35.467
but I got a call on the way here,

02:35.468 --> 02:37.869
and I have to head back to my office.

02:37.870 --> 02:39.638
I still wanted to say hello,

02:39.639 --> 02:42.841
and offer this as an apology.

02:42.842 --> 02:44.976
- Oh.
- My favorite burgundy.

02:44.977 --> 02:48.713
Oh. Thank you, ma'am.

02:52.151 --> 02:54.252
I hope we can reschedule soon,

02:54.253 --> 02:56.821
because I've been
looking forward to this.

02:56.823 --> 02:58.690
Well, anyway,

02:58.691 --> 03:01.293
so nice to meet you.

03:01.294 --> 03:04.262
Bye, baby.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.351 --> 03:26.918
So she's great, right?

03:26.919 --> 03:29.988
Bobby, that woman is old as hell.

03:40.095 --> 03:46.548
<font color="#FFDF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by</font>
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

03:46.748 --> 03:50.096
Bobby, you are dating a senior citizen.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.499
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, why?

03:54.501 --> 03:57.572
Are you doing this for her OxyContin?

03:57.573 --> 04:00.308
You know you can get that
out on the street now.

04:00.309 --> 04:01.743
No. I'm in love with her.

04:01.744 --> 04:05.346
After three weeks?

04:05.347 --> 04:07.048
Well, I guess you got to
move things along quickly

04:07.049 --> 04:10.084
when you don't know how
much time you got left.

04:10.085 --> 04:14.255
Oh, come on. Janet seemed
like a lovely... wise woman.

04:14.256 --> 04:17.024
What happened to supporting
Bobby's girlfriend

04:17.024 --> 04:18.459
no matter what?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.362
I said support pale, dumb or bald.

04:21.363 --> 04:23.664
I didn't say nothing about dusty.

04:26.368 --> 04:28.169
Well, in Bobby's defense,

04:28.170 --> 04:30.371
she looked really good for an older lady.

04:30.372 --> 04:32.640
And there's no way Bobby
could have gotten a woman

04:32.641 --> 04:34.642
that looked like that
while she was in her 30s

04:34.643 --> 04:37.011
or 40s or even 50s.

04:37.012 --> 04:38.946
Uh, she's at a markdown now.

04:38.947 --> 04:41.148
I-It's like buying a
dented can for half off.

04:43.252 --> 04:45.319
Look, me and Janet have
a great relationship.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.988
We have meaningful conversations,

04:46.989 --> 04:48.322
she laughs at all my jokes.

04:48.323 --> 04:49.657
That sounds awesome.

04:49.658 --> 04:52.193
It sounds like a very
mature relationship.

04:52.194 --> 04:54.128
Maxine, you can't talk about her

04:54.129 --> 04:57.565
without using words
like "mature" and "wise."

04:57.566 --> 05:01.235
This woman is a gargoyle and you know it.

05:04.106 --> 05:07.141
Oh, Lord, I have been
too good of a mother.

05:07.142 --> 05:09.644
I have single-handedly

05:09.645 --> 05:12.580
pampered you into a fetish.

05:12.581 --> 05:15.416
Bobby, you're a healthy,
strapping young man.

05:15.417 --> 05:18.319
And this woman is an
old, broke-down lady.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.987
She-she-she's wore out

05:19.988 --> 05:21.656
from years of wear and tear.

05:21.657 --> 05:23.526
She's like a, like a old truck

05:23.527 --> 05:25.827
that's been left out in the
middle of the desert somewhere.

05:25.828 --> 05:27.528
The roof is flapping.

05:27.529 --> 05:29.297
The windows are all broke out.

05:29.298 --> 05:30.765
Tire's flat.

05:30.766 --> 05:32.700
She got Bondo on more
than half of her body.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.602
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, Dad.

05:34.603 --> 05:36.504
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

05:36.505 --> 05:38.406
You guys are blowing this
way out of proportion.

05:38.407 --> 05:39.740
Sometimes you just meet the right person

05:39.741 --> 05:41.175
and the age doesn't matter.

05:41.176 --> 05:42.677
Love is love.

05:42.678 --> 05:44.745
No, it is not. I want grandbabies.

05:44.746 --> 05:48.249
And that woman could not
possibly create a child.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.184
And don't tell me they're gonna be doing

05:50.185 --> 05:51.752
that surrogate mother thing,

05:51.753 --> 05:53.621
because I don't want my grandbabies

05:53.622 --> 05:55.690
being a science experiment.

05:55.691 --> 05:59.126
I refuse to grandmother a cyborg.

06:01.363 --> 06:03.364
Again, you guys, I told you.

06:03.365 --> 06:06.300
If you just Google things,
you'd be way more informed

06:06.301 --> 06:08.235
on how things work.

06:09.471 --> 06:11.405
This is such a double standard.

06:11.406 --> 06:13.140
When an older man dates a younger woman,

06:13.141 --> 06:15.343
no one thinks twice, but
when Madonna kissed Drake,

06:15.344 --> 06:18.546
everyone was grossed
out, including Drake.

06:19.348 --> 06:21.315
Wait a minute.

06:21.316 --> 06:22.817
Bobby, is that a Rolex?

06:22.818 --> 06:24.819
Yes, it is.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.420
Where'd you get that?

06:26.421 --> 06:27.822
Janet bought it for me.

06:27.823 --> 06:29.557
Well, she can afford a Rolex?

06:29.558 --> 06:31.559
Yep. She manages a hedge fund.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.828
Wait. She's rich?

06:33.829 --> 06:35.396
Now it all makes sense.

06:35.397 --> 06:38.065
Bobby, you're just a gold digger.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.767
Bobby, why didn't you tell us

06:39.768 --> 06:42.603
that you were dating
her 'cause she got money?

06:42.604 --> 06:45.806
We never would have
talked about you like that.

06:45.807 --> 06:49.810
Son, you better ride this
till the wheels fall off.

06:49.811 --> 06:51.479
Look, everybody.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.347
- I am not a gold digger.
- Bobby.

06:53.348 --> 06:56.384
You are dating some elderly
tycoon who buys you jewelry.

06:56.385 --> 06:59.086
You're basically Anna Nicole Smith.

06:59.087 --> 07:00.588
Oh, come on. Bobby just told us

07:00.589 --> 07:02.256
over and over how much he loves her.

07:02.257 --> 07:03.591
Just because she has more money than him

07:03.592 --> 07:05.259
doesn't make him a gold digger.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.894
Yes, that's right. Look,
we agreed to go on a date

07:06.895 --> 07:08.462
before I even knew she was rich.

07:08.463 --> 07:10.298
Well, I don't care what you say.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.167
Bobby, this is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.236
And as your father,

07:15.237 --> 07:17.605
I must insist that you marry

07:17.606 --> 07:19.874
this kindly, elderly lady.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.642
Oh, Lord.

07:21.643 --> 07:23.844
Now I'm confused. I'm torn.

07:23.845 --> 07:26.614
On one hand, she's a barren old ghoul,

07:26.615 --> 07:29.116
but on the other, she
could have enough money

07:29.117 --> 07:32.219
to buy herself a new uterus.

07:33.455 --> 07:35.222
That's the spirit, Cynthia.

07:35.223 --> 07:38.893
This old ghoul is about
to be our daughter-in-law.

07:38.894 --> 07:40.695
Bobby, just admit it, man.

07:40.696 --> 07:43.397
You're not dating this woman,
you're dating this watch.

07:43.398 --> 07:45.232
Ah, come on, Jerrod.

07:45.233 --> 07:47.835
You're just jealous 'cause
you wanted a Rolex first

07:47.836 --> 07:49.670
and Bobby beat you to it.

07:49.671 --> 07:50.871
No, no.

07:50.872 --> 07:52.473
What are you talking about?

07:52.474 --> 07:54.375
That's ridiculous, I'm not jealous.

07:54.376 --> 07:56.310
Besides, that watch looks stupid

07:56.311 --> 08:00.615
on your big, black, dumb wrist.

08:00.616 --> 08:02.583
Jerrod.

08:02.584 --> 08:03.884
You are jealous.

08:03.885 --> 08:06.821
You couldn't even buy
Maxine a diamond ring.

08:06.822 --> 08:09.557
She's sitting over there
wearing a mood ring.

08:13.662 --> 08:16.364
It's a ruby.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.999
Hey, look. That ruby turning red.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.667
She must be mad.

08:19.668 --> 08:20.935
No, no.

08:20.936 --> 08:22.269
Stop it, Joe.

08:22.270 --> 08:24.672
Okay, all right, okay. Bobby.

08:24.673 --> 08:26.874
Look, there is no way
she sees you as an equal.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.043
I know Janet said that Rolex was a gift,

08:29.044 --> 08:31.479
but she owns you with that watch now.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.847
It's basically a dog collar around your

08:33.849 --> 08:36.517
big, black, dumb, sweaty wrist.

08:36.518 --> 08:37.852
Look, look, my wrist is normal, okay?

08:37.852 --> 08:39.253
All right.

08:39.254 --> 08:40.721
Don't listen to your brother, Bobby.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.556
He just bought me this beautiful ring,

08:42.557 --> 08:44.291
and I don't owe him anything.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.560
Uh...

08:47.329 --> 08:48.696
Are you serious right now?

08:48.697 --> 08:50.031
Well, now, I'm just saying

08:50.032 --> 08:51.966
that ring was really expensive, Maxine.

08:51.967 --> 08:53.567
It would be very unreasonable

08:53.568 --> 08:54.969
for you to get mad at me about anything

08:54.970 --> 08:56.604
for the next three months.

08:58.674 --> 08:59.874
Hey, everybody. Sorry, I'm late.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.375
- Nekeisha.
- Hey.

09:01.376 --> 09:02.543
Where's Janet?

09:02.544 --> 09:03.878
She had to head back to work.

09:03.879 --> 09:05.479
Do you know this Janet lady?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.748
Yeah. She cool. Small world, too.

09:07.749 --> 09:10.084
She went to high school with my grandma.

09:10.085 --> 09:13.387
Nekeisha, will you please tell Bobby

09:13.388 --> 09:15.656
to stop being a gold digger?

09:15.657 --> 09:17.391
Why would I do that?

09:17.392 --> 09:19.226
I'm already reaping the benefits.

09:19.227 --> 09:21.595
Janet bought Bobby a slow cooker,

09:21.596 --> 09:23.597
and I can't even begin to tell you

09:23.598 --> 09:26.400
how tender my brisket has been lately.

09:26.401 --> 09:28.235
Nekeisha, you didn't bring us none?

09:28.236 --> 09:30.004
Oh, come on, Joe. I don't talk about it,

09:30.005 --> 09:32.406
boy, I be about it.

09:32.407 --> 09:35.342
Oh, yeah.

09:35.343 --> 09:37.611
Keisha, Keisha, Keisha.

09:37.612 --> 09:38.946
Well, look, y'all.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.481
I-I don't care what
anybody thinks, okay?

09:40.482 --> 09:42.016
This is not a way out for me.

09:42.017 --> 09:43.918
I really care about Janet.

09:43.919 --> 09:45.352
Oh, come on, Bobby.

09:45.353 --> 09:46.987
You finally have a steady job

09:46.988 --> 09:48.856
and-and a little control over your life,

09:48.857 --> 09:50.391
why are you just gonna give that control

09:50.392 --> 09:51.792
over to someone else?

09:51.793 --> 09:53.427
Well, he done tried everything else.

09:53.428 --> 09:54.929
This is the only thing that stick.

09:54.930 --> 09:57.765
Maybe being an old,
rich woman's prostitute

09:57.766 --> 09:59.600
is the life he's cut out for.

09:59.601 --> 10:01.102
Yeah, Jerrod.

10:01.103 --> 10:03.801
Not all hoes want to be saved.

10:03.802 --> 10:05.473
What do you mean he's
not gonna have any control

10:05.474 --> 10:06.774
in their relationship?

10:06.775 --> 10:08.542
Oh, come on, Maxine.
We all know the person

10:08.543 --> 10:10.778
with the most money has all
the power in a relationship.

10:10.779 --> 10:12.513
No, they don't.

10:12.514 --> 10:13.781
Of course they do.

10:13.782 --> 10:15.316
You think Stedman's choosing

10:15.317 --> 10:17.651
where he and Oprah go out for dinner?

10:17.652 --> 10:19.353
I bet you his name's not even Stedman.

10:19.354 --> 10:20.621
His name's probably
Tom, and she was like,

10:20.622 --> 10:22.456
"Hey, I'm gonna call you Stedman, now."

10:22.457 --> 10:24.859
And he was like, "Cool. Can
I have some more lobster?"

10:27.329 --> 10:28.690
Since you make more money than me,

10:28.691 --> 10:31.465
does that mean you have the
power in our relationship?

10:31.466 --> 10:32.800
Yeah.

10:32.801 --> 10:34.802
Okay.

10:34.803 --> 10:37.805
So, even if money were
a way to measure power,

10:37.806 --> 10:39.840
you may not always
have more money than me.

10:39.841 --> 10:42.109
Maxine, come on.

10:42.110 --> 10:44.545
I mean, you are a social worker.

10:44.546 --> 10:46.147
And that is really nice and all,

10:46.148 --> 10:47.648
but you'll never earn more money than me.

10:47.649 --> 10:50.050
But don't worry, because I promise

10:50.051 --> 10:52.486
to lead this relationship to greatness.

10:52.487 --> 10:55.523
Oh, well, Jerrod...

10:55.524 --> 10:57.191
you may want to rethink that.

10:57.192 --> 10:58.826
Yeah? Why's that?

10:58.827 --> 11:00.828
'Cause I have a trust
from my Grandma Nancy,

11:00.829 --> 11:03.030
and when she passes, I'll inherit it.

11:04.299 --> 11:05.499
Uh, you talking about
the 93-year-old grandma

11:05.500 --> 11:06.567
with the bad kidney?

11:06.568 --> 11:09.770
Yep. Terrible kidney.

11:09.771 --> 11:11.505
How much is the trust?

11:15.977 --> 11:17.578
Well, I didn't want to tell you like this

11:17.579 --> 11:19.013
in front of your whole family,

11:19.014 --> 11:21.015
but since you're being such an ass,

11:21.016 --> 11:23.050
it's $1.5 million.

11:23.051 --> 11:25.786
- Yahtzee!
- Get out of town!

11:28.857 --> 11:30.524
We're rich?

11:30.525 --> 11:32.092
Well, Cynthia, we must've
done something right,

11:32.093 --> 11:34.929
'cause both of our boys are gold diggers.

11:57.053 --> 11:58.487
Hey.

11:58.488 --> 12:00.122
Can you help me with these?

12:00.123 --> 12:02.224
Is that a cigar?

12:02.225 --> 12:03.959
Yeah. Since I found out we're rich,

12:03.960 --> 12:05.594
I smoke cigars now.

12:05.595 --> 12:08.096
Also wear Versace sunglasses inside,

12:08.097 --> 12:10.732
and then when we get outside,
I switch to the Guccis.

12:10.733 --> 12:13.068
Take those off.

12:13.069 --> 12:14.903
And we don't even have the money yet.

12:14.904 --> 12:16.738
My grandmother's still alive.

12:16.739 --> 12:17.906
Oh, come on, Maxine.

12:17.907 --> 12:19.602
She is one sneeze away from death,

12:19.603 --> 12:21.346
and we both know it.

12:21.347 --> 12:24.149
Also, we only buy organic bananas now.

12:24.150 --> 12:25.984
I'm starting to taste the difference.

12:25.985 --> 12:29.421
And these are not organic.

12:29.422 --> 12:32.858
Did you buy a new watch?

12:32.859 --> 12:35.093
- Did you buy a Rolex?
- Yep.

12:36.279 --> 12:40.249
Jerrod, that has to be,
like, a $30,000 watch.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.517
Thirty-two five.

12:41.518 --> 12:44.620
What is happening?

12:44.621 --> 12:46.355
How could you buy something like this?

12:46.356 --> 12:48.557
Because I love the dough.

12:48.558 --> 12:51.560
Money over everything, Maxine.

12:51.561 --> 12:53.095
Cash rules everything around me.

12:53.096 --> 12:54.697
Stop using hip-hop to
articulate yourself.

12:54.698 --> 12:56.265
Look, Maxine,

12:56.266 --> 12:57.633
here's something that I just don't think

12:57.634 --> 13:00.102
you ever really understood about me.

13:00.103 --> 13:03.639
You see, I am from the ghetto,

13:03.640 --> 13:05.441
and I am obligated

13:05.442 --> 13:07.042
to spend my money irresponsibly

13:07.043 --> 13:08.978
'cause I ain't never had nothing.

13:08.979 --> 13:11.380
Why are you talking like that?

13:11.381 --> 13:12.648
I don't know. I think it's the chain.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.116
Look, Maxine, I bought a chain.

13:14.117 --> 13:15.384
I-I couldn't help myself.

13:15.385 --> 13:17.052
I... Isn't it ironic

13:17.053 --> 13:18.554
that black people were
brought here in chains,

13:18.555 --> 13:20.289
and then as soon as we get money,

13:20.290 --> 13:21.957
we put them on again?

13:21.958 --> 13:24.059
I cannot believe you
are acting like this.

13:24.060 --> 13:25.561
And put out the cigar.

13:25.562 --> 13:27.997
God, you look like Cosby.
It's creeping me out.

13:27.998 --> 13:31.000
Look, Maxine, I realize

13:31.001 --> 13:33.168
that this is upsetting to you,

13:33.169 --> 13:35.037
but there's a lot of upside in this

13:35.038 --> 13:36.672
for you, too, okay?

13:36.673 --> 13:38.641
Now that you make more money than me,

13:38.642 --> 13:41.644
the dynamic in our relationship
has shifted completely.

13:41.645 --> 13:43.145
I'm your Stedman now,

13:43.146 --> 13:44.747
which means that you get to choose

13:44.748 --> 13:46.148
what we watch on television.

13:46.149 --> 13:47.717
You get to choose where
we go out to dinner.

13:47.718 --> 13:50.152
And you can cheat on me once a
year, 'cause you've earned it.

13:50.153 --> 13:51.209
What?

13:51.210 --> 13:53.656
Also, you are allowed to hit me twice.

13:53.657 --> 13:55.090
And you can hit my mom once.

13:55.091 --> 13:56.992
But you can't do both.

13:56.993 --> 13:58.260
Even if you did, I'd probably still...

13:58.261 --> 14:00.062
Jerrod, I don't want to cheat on you,

14:00.063 --> 14:02.197
and I don't want to hit your mom.

14:02.198 --> 14:04.099
God, you criticize Bobby

14:04.100 --> 14:05.768
for being a gold digger, but look at you.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.536
I thought you'd have
more integrity than this.

14:07.537 --> 14:09.672
Well, thought I would, too.

14:09.673 --> 14:12.307
I am as disappointed in me as you are.

14:13.476 --> 14:15.210
I put truffles on an Egg
McMuffin this morning.

14:15.211 --> 14:17.346
Oh, my God.

14:17.347 --> 14:18.681
I can't even be around you like this.

14:18.682 --> 14:20.716
Oh, wait, you want me to leave?

14:20.717 --> 14:22.284
'Cause I-I could leave.

14:22.285 --> 14:24.687
I got a Uber waiting downstairs for me.

14:24.721 --> 14:26.088
I tipped him $200,

14:26.089 --> 14:28.324
so he just stayed out there all day.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.292
Oh, my God. Yes. Just go.

14:30.293 --> 14:33.095
Okay. Well, as you wish, my love.

14:33.096 --> 14:35.030
I'll go.

14:35.031 --> 14:37.199
Hey, Maxine,

14:37.200 --> 14:40.836
I ordered this life-size
statue of Prince off Amazon,

14:40.837 --> 14:42.638
so I'm gonna need somebody
here to sign for it

14:42.639 --> 14:45.808
when it Del... Okay.

14:45.809 --> 14:47.743
Yeah, Sylvia, both my boys,

14:47.744 --> 14:49.745
they got rich women.

14:49.746 --> 14:53.182
Uh-huh. Oh, girl, I'm gonna
buy myself a new Camry.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.683
Okay, thank you, Sylvia.

14:54.684 --> 14:56.719
We are truly blessed. Bye-bye.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.320
Hey, sugar.

14:58.321 --> 15:00.756
Now, here comes one of
my little meal tickets.

15:00.757 --> 15:02.725
Sit down here, boy.

15:02.726 --> 15:05.599
Have a glass of some of
this expensive-ass wine.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.013
You know, this is my new favorite drink:

15:07.014 --> 15:09.916
expensive-ass wine.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.418
Where's Maxine?

15:11.419 --> 15:13.153
Maxine got frustrated with me,

15:13.154 --> 15:14.588
so she asked me to leave.

15:14.589 --> 15:16.156
Well, why would you frustrate

15:16.157 --> 15:19.126
a wonderful woman like her anyway?

15:19.127 --> 15:21.294
No, this money's making me crazy.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.330
Look, bought a Rolex.

15:24.444 --> 15:25.832
It's much nicer than
Bobby's, I might add.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.601
Ooh, both my sons got Rolexes.

15:27.602 --> 15:29.236
I got to call Sylvia back.

15:29.237 --> 15:32.372
- No, Ma.
- Son, you finally gave your mama

15:32.373 --> 15:34.975
something to brag
about. Let her have this.

15:34.976 --> 15:38.345
I thought blowing through money
would be more fun than this.

15:38.346 --> 15:40.647
Well, maybe you just need a nicer Rolex.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.349
Yeah, buy two.

15:42.350 --> 15:43.617
One for each wrist.

15:43.618 --> 15:46.586
That should fill the void inside you.

15:46.587 --> 15:49.156
Hey, Bobby, how could you do this to me?

15:49.157 --> 15:50.457
Look, I had to make a choice.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.125
See, that's why our marriage ended

15:52.126 --> 15:54.528
in the first place.
Bobby, you so damn selfish.

15:54.529 --> 15:56.463
Wait, hold on. What's going on?

15:56.464 --> 15:57.864
You tell 'em, Bobby.

15:57.865 --> 16:00.066
I can't say it without crying.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.135
Look, Janet found out
that me and Nekeisha

16:02.136 --> 16:03.970
never actually got divorced.

16:03.971 --> 16:05.372
She told me if I want to be with her,

16:05.373 --> 16:06.973
then I couldn't be friends with Nekeisha.

16:06.974 --> 16:08.208
What?

16:08.209 --> 16:10.977
Keisha, you are a member

16:10.978 --> 16:14.047
of the Carmichael family.

16:14.048 --> 16:15.482
But times change.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.584
Hate to see you go.

16:19.787 --> 16:22.556
No, no, no, I-I picked Nekeisha.

16:22.557 --> 16:24.257
Look, I told Janet if me and Nekeisha

16:24.258 --> 16:26.159
couldn't be friends, then it was over.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.594
She took the slow cooker.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.696
She took the damn slow cooker.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.665
You know, I tried to make
a brisket in the oven.

16:31.666 --> 16:33.667
It came out burnt and dry.

16:33.668 --> 16:35.669
Bobby, why did you
choose me? We needed her.

16:35.670 --> 16:37.003
Bobby, why you gonna choose

16:37.004 --> 16:38.238
your ex-wife over money?

16:38.239 --> 16:39.406
Have you lost your mind?

16:39.407 --> 16:41.274
Yes, Bobby,

16:41.275 --> 16:43.543
you had a rich, beautiful, rich woman.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.445
What were you thinking?

16:45.446 --> 16:48.014
But she said me and Nekeisha
couldn't be friends anymore.

16:48.015 --> 16:49.796
Bobby, we still would've been friends.

16:49.797 --> 16:51.351
I would have seen you all the time.

16:51.352 --> 16:54.588
That woman goes to bed at 8:00.

16:58.359 --> 17:00.527
You know, Bobby,

17:00.528 --> 17:04.130
I never realized this
about you before today,

17:04.131 --> 17:06.398
but you have integrity.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.935
Like, you chose morals
and principles over money.

17:09.936 --> 17:12.439
Why?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.107
Look, it's like I told you, Jerrod.

17:14.108 --> 17:15.709
I don't care if she's rich.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.278
Okay? It's more about
who I am than what I have.

17:18.279 --> 17:20.413
That stuff doesn't mean anything to me.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.681
Wow.

17:21.682 --> 17:23.116
- Really?
- No.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.718
Your brother's stupid.

17:24.719 --> 17:26.486
Bobby has blown

17:26.487 --> 17:29.022
his one chance he had at
making it in this world,

17:29.023 --> 17:30.724
and he is dead to all of us.

17:30.725 --> 17:33.093
But we still got Maxine.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.128
So focus, Jerrod,

17:35.129 --> 17:37.731
and give her the rest of
this expensive-ass wine.

17:37.732 --> 17:39.666
Tell her

17:39.667 --> 17:42.469
I've always loved her.

17:42.470 --> 17:43.970
- But I still don't...
- Bobby.

17:43.971 --> 17:46.139
Your opinion don't matter no more.

17:51.512 --> 17:53.680
Hey.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.482
I went to see my family,

17:55.483 --> 17:58.518
and my dad wanted me to give you

17:58.519 --> 18:01.788
this half-empty bottle of wine.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.590
And my mom wanted me to tell you

18:03.591 --> 18:05.325
that she's always loved you.

18:05.326 --> 18:07.327
So has everyone

18:07.328 --> 18:09.195
gone insane about this money?

18:09.196 --> 18:11.531
Yeah, pretty much.

18:11.532 --> 18:14.801
Maxine, I hit rock bottom today.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.437
I felt myself looking up to Bobby.

18:17.438 --> 18:20.540
Like, really admiring him as a person.

18:20.541 --> 18:23.777
Oh, my God. That must
have really scared you.

18:23.778 --> 18:25.679
It was terrifying.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.148
But I needed something
like that to make me realize

18:28.149 --> 18:29.783
that I need to have more integrity

18:29.784 --> 18:31.518
when it comes to money.

18:31.519 --> 18:34.387
Well, I'm glad you figured that out.

18:34.388 --> 18:37.223
But I never will. So I need you

18:37.224 --> 18:39.392
to sign a postnuptial agreement

18:39.393 --> 18:42.295
guaranteeing that I can never
touch your grandma's fortune.

18:42.296 --> 18:45.298
Wait. You want to sign a document

18:45.299 --> 18:48.702
that keeps you away from $1.5 million?

18:48.703 --> 18:51.471
Yeah, I do. More than
anything in the world.

18:51.472 --> 18:53.573
Come on, that is ridiculous.

18:53.574 --> 18:55.375
You know that what's mine is yours

18:55.376 --> 18:57.644
and what's yours is mine.
That's what marriage is.

18:57.645 --> 19:00.814
But, Maxine, of all the
things I bought recently,

19:00.815 --> 19:03.049
the only thing that matters
to me is your wedding ring,

19:03.050 --> 19:04.751
and that's because I
worked hard for that.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.120
Like, I saved up all year for that.

19:07.121 --> 19:10.090
Everything else...
this Rolex, this chain,

19:10.091 --> 19:12.158
that parakeet that's in the bedroom...

19:12.159 --> 19:13.660
none of it means anything to me

19:13.661 --> 19:16.830
because I didn't earn it.

19:16.831 --> 19:20.100
Yeah, this ring is
really special to me, too.

19:20.101 --> 19:23.436
So if you need me to,

19:23.437 --> 19:25.338
I guess I will call a lawyer tomorrow

19:25.339 --> 19:28.241
and make sure that you never
get any of my grandma's money.

19:28.242 --> 19:30.110
Thank you.

19:30.811 --> 19:33.613
You got something in your mouth?

19:33.614 --> 19:36.349
Oh, yeah, I bought a grill.

19:36.350 --> 19:37.584
Oh.

19:37.585 --> 19:39.719
Again, the ghetto has destroyed me.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.379
Well, if it isn't my favorite son

19:47.380 --> 19:49.915
and daughter-in-law.

19:49.916 --> 19:51.650
We were in the neighborhood.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.385
Thought we'd just drop by

19:53.386 --> 19:57.322
a few bags of pistachio nuts.

19:59.426 --> 20:01.727
And, Maxine, you are right.

20:01.728 --> 20:04.830
They are really the quality nut.

20:04.831 --> 20:08.233
Okay, before you guys go any further,

20:08.234 --> 20:10.469
you should know that I asked Maxine

20:10.470 --> 20:12.371
to sign a postnuptial agreement

20:12.372 --> 20:13.906
restricting me from her grandma's money.

20:13.907 --> 20:15.574
She agreed.

20:15.575 --> 20:18.344
So I nor any member

20:18.345 --> 20:20.136
of the Carmichael family will have access

20:20.137 --> 20:21.513
to her grandma's money.

20:25.418 --> 20:27.553
Well.

20:30.991 --> 20:33.926
Why does money make this
family throw food in the trash?

20:33.927 --> 20:35.894
You know there are
starving kids in Africa.

20:35.895 --> 20:38.597
Make up your mind about
these Africans, Maxine.

20:38.598 --> 20:40.999
Are they dead, or are they starving?

20:42.869 --> 20:46.305
I raised two of the
stupidest boys in the world.

20:46.306 --> 20:47.806
Come on, Cynthia.

20:47.807 --> 20:51.343
Let's go on back home
to our horrible lives.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.714
- Jerrod Carmichael?
- Oh.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.082
Hey, Maxine.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.585
I know what I said earlier,

20:59.586 --> 21:02.588
but I'm gonna want to
keep this Prince statue.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.072
