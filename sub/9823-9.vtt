WEBVTT

00:02.537 --> 00:03.503
Why did we have to come here?

00:03.605 --> 00:05.371
Production value. Showmanship.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.307
You ready to
sign? Let's do this.

00:07.409 --> 00:09.409
- I lost Mesa Verde.
- What happened?

00:09.411 --> 00:10.643
Sticking with HHM.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.011
Kevin got his head turned.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.180
- By Howard?
- ‭ No, Chuck.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.748
You were fantastic t... Oh.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.851
I need an X-Acto knife, a ruler,

00:18.954 --> 00:20.687
and point me to your best copier.

00:22.791 --> 00:24.190
What's all this?

00:24.292 --> 00:27.193
I needed a soaker for
the rhododendrons out back.

05:09.393 --> 05:13.329
Okay. All set.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.868
Thank you for your patience.

05:18.903 --> 05:22.304
Didn't you say that the
hearing is more or less a formality?

05:22.340 --> 05:25.207
Well, the real work's
already been done, yes.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.910
In that case, ‭I'm
fine covering it myself.

05:27.945 --> 05:29.612
Kevin and Paige ‭don't
need both of us there.

05:29.647 --> 05:31.480
That may be strictly true,

05:31.515 --> 05:34.583
but we want to send the
right message, don't we?

05:34.619 --> 05:37.152
I'm just worried about your comfort.

05:37.188 --> 05:39.255
I find victory laps very comforting.

06:47.425 --> 06:51.026
Well-done, my friend.

06:54.865 --> 06:56.465
Good morning.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.301
This meeting of the New
Mexico State Banking Board

06:59.337 --> 07:00.669
is now in session.

07:00.705 --> 07:03.706
We have Mesa Verde here with us today,

07:03.741 --> 07:06.675
and they're
represented by Charles McGill.

07:06.711 --> 07:09.144
Nice to have you back, Charles.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.213
Thank you. Good to be back.

07:11.248 --> 07:14.216
I'm here with my
colleague, Howard Hamlin.

07:14.251 --> 07:17.019
And may I introduce Mr. Kevin Wachtell,

07:17.054 --> 07:20.222
President and Chairman
of Mesa Verde Holdings,

07:20.257 --> 07:23.559
and Ms. Paige Novick, Mesa
Verde Senior Counsel.

07:23.594 --> 07:24.927
Hello and welcome.

07:24.962 --> 07:27.596
I believe staff has
found the application

07:27.631 --> 07:29.932
to meet the basic
requirements for approval.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.367
That's right, isn't it?

07:31.402 --> 07:33.002
With your permission,

07:33.037 --> 07:34.870
Mr. Wachtell would like
to make a brief statement

07:34.905 --> 07:36.538
in support of the application.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.176
Mr. Commissioner,

07:41.212 --> 07:43.912
ladies and gentlemen of the
New Mexico Banking Board,

07:43.948 --> 07:45.614
I'm honored and grateful

07:45.649 --> 07:47.783
to appear before you this morning.

07:47.818 --> 07:50.586
We believe ‭that
our proposed expansion

07:50.621 --> 07:54.723
is in the public interest
both for Arizona and our own state.

07:54.759 --> 07:58.293
For 46 years, the men and
women of Mesa Verde Bank and Trust

07:58.329 --> 08:00.462
have prided
ourselves on personal service

08:00.498 --> 08:03.899
and attention to detail second to none.

08:03.934 --> 08:06.101
Mesa Verde continues to operate

08:06.137 --> 08:09.471
at a Tier One leverage
ratio of 11.2%, and we feel...

08:09.507 --> 08:10.939
Uh, hold on.

08:10.975 --> 08:13.108
Excuse me, Mr.
Wachtell. Just one moment.

08:17.314 --> 08:19.882
What's going on?

08:19.917 --> 08:21.617
Well, let's find out.

08:21.652 --> 08:24.953
Uh, Mr. Commissioner, is
there something we can clarify?

08:24.989 --> 08:26.722
Uh, yes.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.157
Can you give us the address

08:28.192 --> 08:29.792
of the proposed Scottsdale branch again?

08:29.856 --> 08:30.658
Certainly.

08:30.659 --> 08:35.270
It's 1216 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale,
Arizona, 85262.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.932
1-2-1-6?

08:36.967 --> 08:37.592
Okay.

08:37.594 --> 08:40.169
Because the
application I'm looking at today

08:40.203 --> 08:42.404
clearly gives the address as 1216.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.239
1216... that's correct, sir.

08:44.275 --> 08:49.978
But in the original submission,
we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive.

08:50.014 --> 08:52.081
- It is 1261.
- ‭1261.

08:52.116 --> 08:56.151
I think if you double-check, you'll
see that 1216 is correct.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.454
There seem to be ‭two
different addresses here.

08:58.489 --> 09:01.190
Mr. Commissioner, I have a
copy of our notice of intent,

09:01.225 --> 09:03.425
which was published in
newspapers in Arizona

09:03.461 --> 09:04.927
and New Mexico.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.829
It clearly states the
address is 1261 Rosella Drive.

09:06.864 --> 09:08.144
Mr... ‭Mr. Commissioner, I-if...

09:08.165 --> 09:10.599
1-2-6-1 Rosella Drive.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.572
Yes, I have a copy of
the notice of intent, too,

09:14.695 --> 09:19.927
but on the actual filing,
the address reads 1-2-1-6.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.011
So... which is it?

09:23.047 --> 09:26.294
Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I
may confer with my clients?

09:26.450 --> 09:27.832
Certainly, please.

09:27.949 --> 09:31.687
It's absolutely 1261.

09:31.722 --> 09:33.322
You are mistaken,

09:33.357 --> 09:35.691
and with all due respect, you're
muddying the waters here.

09:35.726 --> 09:37.326
"Muddying the water"?

09:37.361 --> 09:38.827
‭Look.

09:38.863 --> 09:40.129
Just look.

09:40.164 --> 09:43.632
Well, ‭this is clearly an error.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.667
It's 1261.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.803
I know where my own damn bank is.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.838
Uh, let's just all calm down.
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

09:49.874 --> 09:52.241
I've got a building
remodel at 1261 Rosella.

09:52.276 --> 09:54.343
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.

09:54.378 --> 09:59.181
I-I don't quite underst... 1261.

09:59.216 --> 10:01.016
- 1261.
- Is this gonna be a problem?

10:01.051 --> 10:03.051
No, I'm sure it won't be.

10:03.087 --> 10:05.754
Um, M-Mr. Commissioner, I apologize.

10:05.789 --> 10:08.857
Unaccountably, there appears to be a...

10:08.893 --> 10:11.093
discrepancy in our filing.

10:11.128 --> 10:13.829
So the correct address the one

10:13.864 --> 10:15.864
that appeared in the
notice of intent, the 1261?

10:15.900 --> 10:17.266
It would seem so.

10:17.301 --> 10:19.568
Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd
like to request a, um,

10:19.603 --> 10:22.604
an adjournment
of just a few minutes

10:22.640 --> 10:26.441
so that we can amend the
filing to reflect the correct address.

10:26.477 --> 10:30.879
Well, I-I can give you
an adjournment, uh, uh,

10:30.915 --> 10:36.451
but, uh... uh, I don't
think we can get you back in today.

10:36.487 --> 10:40.455
If I may, when do you think
you might be able to schedule us?

10:40.491 --> 10:41.703
I'm being told by staff

10:41.817 --> 10:46.895
that they've already done the research
for 1216 Rosella Drive.

10:46.931 --> 10:49.231
Our folks are going to have
to go back to square one

10:49.266 --> 10:50.766
on the new address.

10:50.801 --> 10:53.969
If we... we could d obin a
provisional agreement today,

10:54.004 --> 10:55.637
to allow the... the branch to open be...

10:55.673 --> 10:56.675
No, no. All due respect,

10:56.811 --> 11:00.642
it's up to you folks to
submit accurate paperwork.

11:00.678 --> 11:03.245
Maybe next time, double-check.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.915
Now, uh, the soonest we
could revisit this matter...

11:06.951 --> 11:11.086
well, it... it looks
like six weeks from Friday.

11:11.121 --> 11:15.657
We... ‭We can't wait six weeks.

11:15.693 --> 11:19.962
Mr. Commissioner, M-Mesa
Verde has put effort a a... resources

11:19.997 --> 11:23.432
into preparing this
branch to open immediately.

11:23.467 --> 11:27.269
However unusual, a
provisional a-approval

11:27.304 --> 11:29.671
would be most
appreciated, most welcome.

11:29.707 --> 11:31.240
Time being of the essence...

11:31.275 --> 11:33.275
Charles, I'm sorry. I'll
see you in six weeks.

11:33.310 --> 11:36.011
That closes the matter for today.

11:36.046 --> 11:39.281
Will staff please note that
Mesa Verde will return in six weeks...

11:41.986 --> 11:44.186
That's on the schedule now.

11:44.221 --> 11:48.023
And we'll have expedited a.

11:48.058 --> 11:49.958
This is not possible.

11:49.994 --> 11:54.296
This is not possible!

11:54.331 --> 11:55.831
Ohh.

11:57.635 --> 12:00.235
Ohh.

12:05.843 --> 12:10.112
1261. No. No.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.147
- Chuck.
- ‭

12:12.182 --> 12:13.548
I don't understand.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.219
I don't understand. It was 1216.

12:17.254 --> 12:18.620
It was. I checked!

12:18.656 --> 12:20.322
I double-checked!

12:20.357 --> 12:21.623
Chuck, it happened.

12:21.659 --> 12:23.558
Now we take our licks, and we move on.

12:23.594 --> 12:25.661
This doesn't just reflect you...

12:25.696 --> 12:28.864
an office full of associates and
paralegals let this get by.

12:28.899 --> 12:30.632
I did, too, for that matter.

12:30.668 --> 12:33.702
It was 1216... I promise you.

12:35.272 --> 12:37.839
Everyone makes mistakes.

12:52.189 --> 12:55.924
This was no mistake.

14:22.112 --> 14:26.448
I'm buying a round for the house.

14:26.483 --> 14:29.117
- Yeah?
- ‭Yeah.

14:31.488 --> 14:33.588
Hey! Hey, listen up, everybody!

14:33.624 --> 14:36.458
This gentleman's buyin
a round for the house!

14:41.925 --> 14:43.384
All right, lift with your kneess.

14:43.547 --> 14:46.111
What does the evev mean...
"lift with your knees"?

14:46.237 --> 14:48.287
I don't know. It's something
sweaty people say. Here we go.

14:48.418 --> 14:50.475
1, 2, 3.

14:51.779 --> 14:53.111
Got it. Almost.

14:53.147 --> 14:55.347
Almost, almost, almost, almost.

14:55.382 --> 14:56.915
Got it? ‭AII right.

14:56.950 --> 15:00.485
Oh, right there. Go. Go.

15:03.357 --> 15:04.856
You okay?

15:04.892 --> 15:07.859
Nothin a few years ‭ofhysical
therapy won't fix.

15:07.895 --> 15:09.528
‭Okay.

15:09.563 --> 15:12.564
All right. Push.

15:14.468 --> 15:16.001
Slow, slow, slow, slow.

15:16.036 --> 15:17.636
Corner, corner, corner.

15:31.985 --> 15:34.386
- Yeah.
- ‭Get that one.

15:51.038 --> 15:52.704
Hi, Paige.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.539
How are you?

15:55.609 --> 15:57.375
Yeah, I mean, no.

15:57.411 --> 15:59.010
No, it's fine.

16:00.214 --> 16:02.013
Uh-huh.

16:04.852 --> 16:06.618
What?

16:07.651 --> 16:11.590
Well, yes.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.659
Of course. Right, I understand.

16:14.695 --> 16:15.994
Okay.

16:16.029 --> 16:18.597
Yeah, that would be perfect.

16:18.632 --> 16:20.999
I'll see you then. Great.

16:21.034 --> 16:24.035
And, uh, listen, Paige, thank you.

16:24.071 --> 16:25.403
Thank you.

16:33.046 --> 16:34.379
I, uh.

16:34.414 --> 16:35.847
Jimmy.

16:35.883 --> 16:38.617
What? What's up?

16:38.652 --> 16:40.085
I, uh...

16:40.120 --> 16:44.122
I just got Mesa Verde back.

16:46.727 --> 16:49.895
- Seriously?
- ‭Seriououy.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.597
Holy shit! That's unbelievable!

16:52.633 --> 16:55.133
Yes.

16:55.169 --> 16:57.536
I... What happened to HHM?

16:57.571 --> 16:58.937
Uh, Paige didn't go into it.

16:58.972 --> 17:00.772
She just said ‭the
filing didn't go through.

17:00.808 --> 17:02.274
We're gonna meet this afternoon.

17:02.309 --> 17:04.209
Hey, what did I tell you?

17:04.243 --> 17:06.377
Sometimes, the good guys win.

17:08.015 --> 17:10.648
Oh, it sounds like ‭there's
some regulatory issues.

17:10.684 --> 17:12.384
Kevin's still worried that one lawyer

17:12.419 --> 17:13.652
won't be able to handle it.

17:13.686 --> 17:15.319
You can.

17:15.355 --> 17:16.788
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get a
paralegal, maybe two of them,

17:16.824 --> 17:18.757
and I absolutely ‭will
pay for it out of my end.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.492
No. Come on. Split it down the middle.

17:20.527 --> 17:21.760
You know what?

17:21.795 --> 17:23.461
I need ‭a Westlaw terminal right away.

17:23.497 --> 17:25.463
I don't even
know who to call to get that done.

17:25.499 --> 17:26.932
These are high-class problems.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.834
Yeah, but it's a
major piece of work, Jimmy.

17:28.869 --> 17:30.769
It's just...
It's... It's... This is major.

17:30.804 --> 17:32.470
Hey, Kim, you've got this, all right?

17:32.506 --> 17:34.773
- So take a moment.
- ‭

17:34.808 --> 17:36.942
Breathe. Savor.

17:38.512 --> 17:40.478
You know what? You're right.

17:40.514 --> 17:42.914
Damn right I'm right.

17:51.725 --> 17:54.459
It's Ernie.

17:56.463 --> 17:57.662
Hi, Ernie.

17:57.698 --> 17:58.964
What's up?

18:01.535 --> 18:04.703
Yeah, no, Paige just called me.

18:04.738 --> 18:08.139
Uh-huh. Did Chuck say why...

18:09.576 --> 18:11.142
So, when...

18:13.347 --> 18:16.014
Sure. ‭No time like the present.

18:16.049 --> 18:18.850
Okay. Thanks.

18:18.886 --> 18:20.785
The Mesa Verde files...

18:20.821 --> 18:23.955
Chuck's ready ‭to
turn thememveveto me.

18:23.991 --> 18:26.458
Wow. Really?

18:26.493 --> 18:28.360
That was... quick.

18:28.395 --> 18:29.861
Yeah.

18:29.897 --> 18:32.731
Uh, I'm gonna go
change and get over there.

18:32.766 --> 18:34.699
- You want some help? ‭
- That depends.

18:34.735 --> 18:37.335
Are you gonna carry
boxes, or you gonna gloat?

18:37.371 --> 18:40.005
Uh, some from column
"A," some from column "B."

18:41.909 --> 18:43.341
Ground yourself.

18:43.377 --> 18:45.744
W... Sorry?

18:45.779 --> 18:48.246
Just touch the thing.

18:50.784 --> 18:54.419
What the hell? This thing doesn't...

18:56.390 --> 18:58.089
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Kim. ‭
- Hey, Ernie.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.691
Somethin's wrong with the lock.

18:59.726 --> 19:02.004
Mr. McGill had me call a
locksmith and change em.

19:03.230 --> 19:05.830
Yeah? Why'd he do that?

19:09.236 --> 19:11.403
Hey, Chuck, why'd you change the locks?

19:12.806 --> 19:14.172
Ernesto, I think we're good.

19:14.207 --> 19:15.674
I'm sure you're
needed back at the office.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.909
Well... I'll get goin, then.

19:17.945 --> 19:20.378
- Thanks.
- ‭Bye, Jimmy. Bye, Kim.

19:20.414 --> 19:22.080
- Bye, Ernie. ‭
See ya, Ernie.

19:22.115 --> 19:25.383
So, Chuck, ‭what's
the deal with the locks?

19:25.419 --> 19:28.186
Kim, I was hoping to have
this conversation with you

19:28.221 --> 19:29.921
and you alone.

19:29.957 --> 19:33.391
However... I guess it's time

19:33.427 --> 19:35.427
to clear the air once and for all.

19:35.462 --> 19:38.496
Clear the air about what?

19:39.599 --> 19:42.701
He sabotaged me.

19:42.736 --> 19:44.269
Buddy, what are you, uh...

19:44.304 --> 19:45.537
Please.

19:45.572 --> 19:47.105
Don't bother.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.241
You and I both know ‭exactly
what I'm talking about.

19:50.277 --> 19:52.210
I don't.

19:52.245 --> 19:54.312
Yesterday morning was the
worst professional humiliation

19:54.348 --> 19:56.147
of my life.

19:56.183 --> 20:00.285
A single transpositional
error cost my client time and money

20:00.320 --> 20:03.121
and permanently damaged my reputation.

20:03.156 --> 20:06.925
But then I
realized... it wasn't an error.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.828
Not at all.

20:09.863 --> 20:14.632
A week ago last night, I was
right there on that couch,

20:14.668 --> 20:19.738
barely cononious, and Jimmy showed up.

20:19.773 --> 20:22.574
And he sent Ernesto away.

20:22.609 --> 20:26.444
My brother was gonna take care of me.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.280
And in the dead of night,

20:29.316 --> 20:31.082
he went through my Mesa Verde files.

20:31.118 --> 20:32.993
Uh, you know what? We don't
have to listen to this.

20:32.994 --> 20:39.157
She does! You do... for your own good.

20:39.192 --> 20:42.861
Now, in these files are 13 documents

20:42.896 --> 20:46.664
containing the address of Mesa
Verde's proposed branch...

20:46.700 --> 20:49.834
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.

20:49.870 --> 20:53.872
Jimmy pulled each and every
one, then he left me here,

20:53.907 --> 20:57.776
sweating and delirious, while
he went off to doctor them.

20:57.811 --> 21:00.278
You'd need a photocopier for that.

21:00.313 --> 21:03.314
Where'd you go... some
all-night copy shop?

21:04.651 --> 21:07.052
With a little
careful cutting and pasting,

21:07.087 --> 21:08.653
he created duplicates...

21:08.688 --> 21:10.822
virtually identical to my originals,

21:10.857 --> 21:12.490
but with one key change...

21:12.526 --> 21:16.327
1261 Rosella Drive ‭became
1216 Rosella Drive.

21:16.363 --> 21:18.029
This is sounding like a lot of work.

21:18.065 --> 21:19.898
No one ever accused you of being lazy...

21:19.933 --> 21:22.300
every other sin in the
book, but not that one.

21:22.335 --> 21:23.668
And if you're wondering

21:23.703 --> 21:25.804
if Jimmy's up to a
little casual forgery,

21:25.839 --> 21:29.040
you should know in high
school, he had a thrivininbusiness

21:29.076 --> 21:31.843
making fake I.D.s ‭so
his buddies could buy beer.

21:31.878 --> 21:33.912
You going all the way
back to high school, huh?

21:33.947 --> 21:36.347
Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

21:36.383 --> 21:37.982
You both started young.

21:39.686 --> 21:42.353
He came back here and put his
new versions in my files.

21:42.389 --> 21:44.756
And then, the next day,

21:44.791 --> 21:47.926
my caring brother took his leave.

21:47.961 --> 21:50.995
He knew that I would
use his modified documents

21:51.031 --> 21:54.532
to write Mesa Verde's
submission to the state regulator.

21:54.568 --> 21:57.335
And so I did, over and over...

21:57.370 --> 22:00.438
I typed "1216" instead of "1261."

22:00.474 --> 22:04.342
I remember
thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive...

22:04.377 --> 22:06.678
that's just one year after 1215,

22:06.713 --> 22:09.280
the year the Magna Carta was signed."

22:09.316 --> 22:12.250
Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.

22:12.285 --> 22:15.386
So, you're saying, if we look in here,

22:15.422 --> 22:17.522
all the addresses will be wrong?

22:17.557 --> 22:20.892
Well, of course you weren't
gonna leave evidence behind.

22:20.927 --> 22:24.262
I'm guessing yesterday
morning, you waited until I left,

22:24.297 --> 22:26.698
then used your key to let yourself in

22:26.733 --> 22:28.433
and return the originals.

22:28.468 --> 22:30.902
No crime is complete
without the cover-up.

22:30.937 --> 22:32.303
Oh, come on.

22:32.339 --> 22:35.707
I did all this...
what... for some business?

22:37.744 --> 22:40.979
He did it for you.

22:45.619 --> 22:47.886
Oh, I'm sure you didn't
know anything about it.

22:47.921 --> 22:49.754
I believe he went off on his own

22:49.789 --> 22:52.590
and did this as some kind
of twisted romantic gesture.

22:52.626 --> 22:54.592
Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down

22:54.628 --> 22:56.594
with a cold washcloth on your head.

22:56.630 --> 23:00.398
And now that you
know, you have no choice.

23:00.433 --> 23:04.302
This is about a client... a
client who has been defrauded.

23:04.337 --> 23:06.738
As a sworn officer of the court,

23:06.773 --> 23:08.940
as Mesa Verde's attorney of record,

23:08.975 --> 23:11.809
you have no recourue but
to go to Kevin Wachtell

23:11.845 --> 23:13.178
anmake a full disclosure.

23:13.213 --> 23:14.913
This... This whole song and dance...

23:14.948 --> 23:16.748
it's all about getting his client back.

23:16.783 --> 23:18.616
- That's all this is. ‭
- Not in the least.

23:18.652 --> 23:20.818
If, knowing the truth,
they still decide to go...

23:20.854 --> 23:24.489
You can't ststanthe fact that
they chose her over you.

23:24.524 --> 23:25.924
I can't stand the fact

23:25.959 --> 23:27.926
that my own brother stabbed
me in the back!

23:27.961 --> 23:30.094
I can't stand the
fact that you've deceived

23:30.130 --> 23:32.363
- and ruined this fine young woman!
- "Ruined"?

23:32.399 --> 23:33.831
What is this... the 1840s?

23:33.867 --> 23:36.034
What are you talking
about? She's not ruined!

23:36.069 --> 23:37.769
Jimmy.

23:42.976 --> 23:45.877
If what you're saying is true,

23:45.912 --> 23:49.847
Jimmy could be
charged with forgery, fraud,

23:49.883 --> 23:53.218
falsifying evidence, even
breaking and entering.

23:53.253 --> 23:55.286
Frankly, I am sick about this.

23:55.322 --> 23:57.655
But facts are facts.

23:57.691 --> 24:00.825
And what is your evidence?

24:00.860 --> 24:04.062
My evidence?

24:04.097 --> 24:07.498
My evidence is knowing my
brother for his entire life.

24:07.534 --> 24:10.468
Chuck, I think ‭there
is another explanation...

24:10.503 --> 24:12.370
it's a simpler one.

24:12.405 --> 24:14.639
You made a mistake.

24:14.674 --> 24:16.541
I did not.

24:16.576 --> 24:18.243
You're wororking by lantern,

24:18.278 --> 24:20.678
squinting over 10-point
typepe for hour after hour.

24:20.714 --> 24:23.081
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216

24:23.116 --> 24:24.415
would be the most natural
thing in the world.

24:24.451 --> 24:25.691
It could certainly happen to me.

24:25.719 --> 24:27.619
I did not make a mistake!

24:28.722 --> 24:30.054
I believe you did.

24:30.056 --> 24:31.723
Look, I understand that you have a...

24:31.758 --> 24:33.558
a great affection for Jimmy.

24:33.593 --> 24:36.728
A great many people do, but
please open your eyes here!

24:36.763 --> 24:39.998
You made a mistake, and
instead of just facing up to it,

24:40.033 --> 24:42.400
you accuse your brother
of plotttting ainst you.

24:42.435 --> 24:44.402
You come up ‭with
this elaborate scheme.

24:44.437 --> 24:46.004
He's capable of this!

24:46.039 --> 24:47.238
You know he is!

24:47.274 --> 24:50.508
I know he's not perfect!

24:50.543 --> 24:53.011
And I know he cuts corners.

24:53.046 --> 24:55.546
But you're the one who
made him this way.

24:55.582 --> 24:58.249
He idolizes you.

24:58.285 --> 25:00.852
He accepts you.

25:00.887 --> 25:02.754
He takes care of you.

25:02.789 --> 25:07.025
And all he ever wanted was
your love and support,

25:07.060 --> 25:09.727
but all you've ever done is judge him.

25:09.763 --> 25:11.729
You never believed in him.

25:11.765 --> 25:14.966
You never wanted him to succeed.

25:16.903 --> 25:19.771
And you know what?

25:23.176 --> 25:25.576
I feel sorry for him.

25:29.783 --> 25:32.684
And I feel sorry for you.

26:06.853 --> 26:09.754
- Jesus! What?
- ‭

26:11.224 --> 26:13.591
Kim! What?

26:15.862 --> 26:18.363
Just drive.

26:40.156 --> 26:43.405
All right, line up by class!

26:43.600 --> 26:47.621
Find your buddy!

26:47.657 --> 26:50.057
Okay, kids, come on.

26:59.168 --> 27:02.636
Let's go.

27:21.190 --> 27:22.456
Come on. Come on.

27:22.491 --> 27:24.425
- Plt yourself. ‭
- All right. Here?

27:24.460 --> 27:25.826
Yeah. Right there.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.761
- About yea high.
- ‭

27:27.797 --> 27:29.563
Aim it up at me... heroic.

27:29.598 --> 27:30.898
Heroic? Good luck with that.

27:30.933 --> 27:32.399
Just frame me up, all right?

27:32.435 --> 27:34.068
Make sure you get the neck, okay?

27:34.103 --> 27:35.502
- It's a low-angle shot.
- ‭Okay.

27:35.538 --> 27:36.970
Hey, you know what? Let me see.

27:37.006 --> 27:38.272
Oh, I-it's just base.

27:38.307 --> 27:39.907
What... am I dying of consumption?

27:39.942 --> 27:41.742
Well, at your age, ‭you
don't want to look too red.

27:41.777 --> 27:43.857
- It looks like rosacea.
- And what's with all the...

27:43.879 --> 27:46.080
I'm just trying to make it look
like you have a jawline.

27:46.115 --> 27:47.448
I do have a jawline.

27:47.483 --> 27:49.116
You know what?

27:49.151 --> 27:51.685
You stand in for me.

27:51.721 --> 27:53.487
Hey, crouch down.

27:53.522 --> 27:55.189
Okay. Move to your left. The other left.

27:55.224 --> 27:56.590
More. More. Okay, boom!

27:56.625 --> 27:58.425
That's what I'm
talkininabout. You got it.

27:58.461 --> 28:00.194
Oh, dude, there's got to be an
easier way to get this shot.

28:00.229 --> 28:01.495
Not for free.

28:01.530 --> 28:03.864
You wanna be a filmmaker, grow a pair.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.599
Here we go. Picture's up.

28:05.634 --> 28:07.334
All right, let's do this.

28:07.370 --> 28:09.837
Last looks.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.640
Rhubarb, rhubarb. 9:00.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.145
Excuse me.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.480
Hi. Are you in charge here?

28:19.515 --> 28:21.281
Yes, I am, ‭and this
is school property.

28:21.317 --> 28:23.183
You're just the
person I want to speak to.

28:23.219 --> 28:25.686
It would be incredibly
helpful if you could get those kids

28:25.721 --> 28:28.222
in that building over there to
just keep it down for a bit.

28:28.257 --> 28:30.023
Just give 'em a worksheet or something?

28:30.059 --> 28:31.892
I mean, just two or
three minutes, just for sound.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.460
This is school property,

28:33.496 --> 28:35.796
and no one is allowed
here without permission.

28:35.831 --> 28:37.064
Of course not.

28:38.667 --> 28:41.135
- You didn't speak to Annette?
- ‭Annette?

28:41.170 --> 28:43.137
In the Superintendent's Office.

28:43.172 --> 28:44.838
Do you know an Annette downtown?

28:44.874 --> 28:46.240
I don't think so.

28:46.275 --> 28:48.175
Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

28:49.879 --> 28:51.678
We're shooting what's
called an establishing shot...

28:51.714 --> 28:52.980
five minutes, tops.

28:53.015 --> 28:54.648
You're not shooting anything

28:54.683 --> 28:56.650
until I'm clear on what's going on here.

28:56.685 --> 28:59.153
The documentary... we're
making a documentary.

28:59.188 --> 29:00.921
That's... Oh!

29:00.956 --> 29:03.657
I was s toldhere was a
display or a plaque of some kind.

29:03.692 --> 29:05.492
Would you know where that would be?

29:05.528 --> 29:06.927
Why would we have a plaque?

29:06.962 --> 29:08.762
Because of who went to school here.

29:08.798 --> 29:10.497
Who went to school here?

29:10.533 --> 29:11.865
Rupert Holmes.

29:11.867 --> 29:13.667
That's who the documentary is about.

29:13.702 --> 29:15.002
I'm sorry. Who?

29:15.037 --> 29:16.670
Rupert Holmes.

29:16.705 --> 29:19.940
You know... Rupert
Holmes, the singer/songwriter.

29:19.975 --> 29:23.677
You know, um... "The Piña Colada Song."

29:23.712 --> 29:26.380

- He went to school here?

29:48.003 --> 29:49.570
Yeah. Class of '64.

29:49.605 --> 29:51.438
He still talks about it.

29:51.474 --> 29:53.407
But the school was built in '71.

29:53.442 --> 29:56.043
Mm. He was a student in the
old building that used to be here.

29:56.078 --> 29:57.578
We're taking a
little... what do you call it?...

29:57.613 --> 29:59.646
artistic liberties.

29:59.682 --> 30:02.950
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?

30:04.520 --> 30:08.155
Well, yeah, ‭and
that's some great trivia,

30:08.190 --> 30:11.658
but he spent his formative
years right here in Albuquerque.

30:11.694 --> 30:14.595
I'll tell you what... why
don't you call Annette

30:14.630 --> 30:16.430
down in ‭the Superintendent's Office?

30:16.465 --> 30:18.932
And we'll just stay here till
you get official word.

30:18.968 --> 30:20.467
- Well, ‭if you don't mind waiting.
- Not at all.

30:20.503 --> 30:21.969
We don't want to break any rules.

30:22.004 --> 30:23.637
Shouldn't take very long, I'm sure.

30:23.672 --> 30:24.860
And no promises,

30:24.883 --> 30:27.140
but I'll see what I can do
about getting the kids to quiet down.

30:27.176 --> 30:28.675
Oh. That would be super helpful.

30:40.322 --> 30:42.356
Chop-chop. Magic time.

30:42.391 --> 30:44.191
All right, let's go.

30:44.226 --> 30:46.326
No last looks. ‭Just
the flag... the flag.

30:46.362 --> 30:48.462
Okay, remember... heroic.

30:48.497 --> 30:50.030
Yeah, you're a hero.

30:50.065 --> 30:53.600
- Big, big hero.
- ‭Gravitas.

30:53.636 --> 30:56.670
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

30:58.807 --> 31:00.274
Go.

31:00.309 --> 31:04.511
Dolly, dolly, dolly.

31:04.547 --> 31:05.979
Nice.

31:07.683 --> 31:09.182
Nice.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.534
- Hey, Mike. ‭
- Hey, Fran.

31:27.570 --> 31:29.703
You still serving breakfast?

31:29.738 --> 31:31.672
For you? Sure. The usual?

31:31.707 --> 31:34.908
Um, be great.

31:34.944 --> 31:36.376
Okay.

31:45.588 --> 31:47.220
- Thanks.
- ‭Mm-hmm.

31:47.256 --> 31:49.723
Anything good in the paper?

31:49.758 --> 31:51.024
No.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.827
Was there ever anything
good in the paper?

31:53.862 --> 31:56.330
Not too often.

31:56.365 --> 31:59.333
- Hey, Fran.
- ‭Yeah?

31:59.368 --> 32:01.535
I got to ask...

32:03.539 --> 32:05.072
Does it ever snow around here?

32:05.107 --> 32:06.707
Sure, it does.

32:06.775 --> 32:09.743
This is gonna be your
first winter in Albuquerque?

32:09.778 --> 32:11.845
Yeah. I'm out from Philadelphia.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.780
Well, it depends on the year.

32:13.816 --> 32:15.048
Mm.

32:15.084 --> 32:16.717
If you stay around long enough,

32:16.752 --> 32:18.418
you'll have something to
shovel... don't you worry.

32:18.454 --> 32:19.920
That suits me.

32:19.955 --> 32:22.122
I live up in Cedar Crest.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.790
We get plenty.

32:23.826 --> 32:26.426
You can shovel my drive if
you're looking for more.

32:26.462 --> 32:27.694
Just say the word.

32:27.730 --> 32:29.363
Yeah, well...

32:29.398 --> 32:32.599
Miss. Check, please?

32:59.194 --> 33:00.560
Yeah.

33:00.596 --> 33:03.463
We gotta talk.

33:13.776 --> 33:16.610
I've got something I need to know,

33:16.645 --> 33:18.979
and I need to know it fast.

33:19.014 --> 33:21.081
What's that?

33:21.116 --> 33:23.350
Got hit the other day.

33:23.385 --> 33:26.186
A truck headed south got hijacked.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.955
Someone stole a quarter million.

33:28.991 --> 33:32.359
Now Hector's flippin'
out, lookin' for who did it.

33:32.394 --> 33:34.194
Thing is...

33:34.229 --> 33:37.497
I think it was you.

33:38.567 --> 33:41.435
They left the driver
hog-tied... not a mark on him.

33:41.470 --> 33:44.705
Anyone in the game woulda
capped him without a second thought.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.940
But this driver? He's still breathin'.

33:46.975 --> 33:48.975
I thought to myself, "Who's the guy

33:49.011 --> 33:51.545
who'll rip off a couple hundred thousand

33:51.580 --> 33:53.814
in drug money and leave a witness?

33:53.849 --> 33:58.346
Who's the guy ‭who
won't pull the trigger?"

34:00.022 --> 34:02.040
You.

34:12.868 --> 34:14.868
I'm not here to squeeze you.

34:14.902 --> 34:17.204
You wanna rip off the
cartel, that's your business.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.739
But here's the thing.

34:18.774 --> 34:21.908
I'm picking up that
driver... Hector's orders.

34:21.944 --> 34:24.177
We're gonna see what he knows,

34:24.213 --> 34:27.380
and if he knows you, that's
bad for both of us.

34:27.416 --> 34:29.483
That shouldn't concern you.

34:29.518 --> 34:31.150
But he was in on it, right?

34:31.186 --> 34:32.719
The driver ‭had nothing to do with it.

34:32.755 --> 34:34.554
- Then who?
- ‭Just me.

34:34.590 --> 34:38.358
You're telling me you did is
without someone on the inside?

34:38.393 --> 34:39.592
Not possible.

34:39.628 --> 34:41.594
How did you know about the truck?

34:41.630 --> 34:43.830
How do you know about the tires?

34:43.866 --> 34:45.331
All I can tell you is,

34:45.367 --> 34:47.400
you guys aren't half as
smart as you think you are.

34:47.436 --> 34:52.438
So the driver... doesn't know anything?

34:52.474 --> 34:54.174
Not a thing. ‭He hear your voice?

34:54.208 --> 34:55.232
- No. ‭
- Right now, Hector's

34:55.257 --> 34:56.510
looking at the competition,

34:56.545 --> 34:58.378
but he hears the driver
say it was some old gringo...

34:58.413 --> 34:59.746
He didn't hear me.

34:59.782 --> 35:02.516
He saw a guy with a
ski mask... that's it.

35:02.551 --> 35:04.251
And you're sure of that?

35:04.286 --> 35:05.552
Yeah.

35:06.622 --> 35:08.588
You better be right.

35:08.624 --> 35:11.558
Why wasn't it in the papers?

35:11.593 --> 35:13.226
What?

35:13.262 --> 35:17.798
The truck robbery... the
cops keeping it out of the papers?

35:17.833 --> 35:19.933
The cops?

35:21.570 --> 35:23.537
The cops don't know shit about it.

35:23.572 --> 35:25.639
How's that?

35:25.674 --> 35:28.041
Is that what this is about?

35:28.076 --> 35:31.311
You wanted to put the cops onto Hector?

35:31.346 --> 35:32.746
Why?

35:32.781 --> 35:34.481
You are nothing to him.

35:34.516 --> 35:36.316
He forgot all about you.

35:36.351 --> 35:39.486
I haven't forgotten him.

35:39.521 --> 35:41.621
You put me in the shit,

35:41.657 --> 35:45.325
just 'cause you got it
in for Hector Salamanca?

35:45.360 --> 35:49.396
Listen, you put the cops
on him, you put them on me.

35:49.431 --> 35:53.733
Doing it for the
money... I get it, but this shit...

35:53.769 --> 35:55.068
that's insane.

35:55.103 --> 35:57.637
You need to calm yourself down,

35:57.673 --> 36:02.375
and you need to take that
hand out of that pocket.

36:17.826 --> 36:20.093
Now, just so you know...

36:20.128 --> 36:21.328
it's over.

36:21.363 --> 36:23.363
I'm done with your boss.

36:23.398 --> 36:26.333
Whatever.

36:26.368 --> 36:30.971
Why wasn't it in the papers?

36:31.006 --> 36:34.674
Because we cleaned it up.

36:34.710 --> 36:36.443
How's that?

36:36.478 --> 36:37.944
We got lucky.

36:37.980 --> 36:40.280
After you left, ‭a
Good Samaritan came along

36:40.315 --> 36:41.982
and said, "Oh, my God!

36:42.017 --> 36:43.783
Oh, my God!"

36:43.819 --> 36:45.986
He cut the driver
loose. The driver called us.

36:46.021 --> 36:48.355
We came out, got the truck.

36:48.390 --> 36:51.057
Made it like it never happened.

36:53.662 --> 36:57.063
And that Good Samaritan?

36:58.166 --> 37:01.167
Hector shot him in the face.

37:01.203 --> 37:04.804
We buried the guy out in the desert.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.207
Like I said...

37:07.242 --> 37:10.543
we cleaned it up.

37:50.819 --> 37:54.688
How was your day?

37:54.723 --> 37:56.456
You know, met with Paige and Kevin,

37:56.491 --> 38:01.294
interviewed some paralegals...

38:01.330 --> 38:03.697
and, uh, this.

38:03.732 --> 38:06.399
What about you?

38:06.435 --> 38:09.269
Finished the commercial.

38:09.304 --> 38:11.705
I don't want to oversell
it, but I think it might be

38:11.740 --> 38:15.508
the greatest 60 seconds in
the history of television.

38:17.512 --> 38:23.049
Tomorrow morning, uh,
somewhere between 11:18 and 11:35,

38:23.085 --> 38:28.722
stop what you're doing and tune
in to "Diagnosis Murder."

38:28.757 --> 38:33.526
I'll make a point of it.

38:37.666 --> 38:42.635
You want to talk about this?

38:42.671 --> 38:44.404
Not now.

38:44.439 --> 38:46.339
Not ever.

38:51.146 --> 38:53.747
I'm just gonna say...

38:53.782 --> 39:00.487
you are meant for Mesa
Verde, and they are meant for you.

39:00.522 --> 39:04.791
So... all is righgt with the world.

39:12.701 --> 39:15.502
Good night.

39:17.072 --> 39:19.672
Night.

39:32.187 --> 39:35.622
Your brother is one smart lawyer.

39:35.657 --> 39:40.193
The smartest one I
know... I mean, no offense.

39:42.998 --> 39:45.565
He'd make quite an adversary.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.600
You'd better believe it.

39:50.839 --> 39:52.238
The kind of adversary

39:52.274 --> 39:55.608
who'd find even the
smallest crack in your defense.

40:01.216 --> 40:04.984
Going against him, you'd
really want to make sure

40:05.020 --> 40:10.023
you've got all your I's
dotted and your t's crossed.

40:15.030 --> 40:18.031
Nothing for him to find.

41:39.347 --> 41:41.815
Hey, how you doing?

41:41.850 --> 41:43.516
Be with you in a minute.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.292
Remember me?

41:57.399 --> 42:00.783
Uh... no.

42:01.903 --> 42:04.471
I got a weird feeling you do, Lance.

42:06.074 --> 42:09.375
Tonight is a funny night.

42:09.411 --> 42:12.212
For some reason tonight,

42:12.214 --> 42:16.683
I feel like I've got all the answers.

42:16.718 --> 42:20.253
I'm feeling kind of like, uh...

42:20.288 --> 42:21.754
like Carnac.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.257
Do you remember when Johnny
Carson used to do Carnac?

42:24.292 --> 42:27.393
You know, he'd give the
answers before the questions.

42:27.429 --> 42:29.963
You know, Ed would
give him the envelope, yeah?

42:29.998 --> 42:32.131
And Johnny would hold
it up to his forehead,

42:32.167 --> 42:37.871
and, um, he'd give the
answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver."

42:37.906 --> 42:39.405
Then Johnny'd tear open the envelope.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.308
And there's the question...

42:42.344 --> 42:44.611
"What did the dead
raccoon say in his will?"

42:44.646 --> 42:46.913
That ring a bell?

42:48.416 --> 42:49.716
Before your time?

42:49.751 --> 42:52.585
All right, well, let's cut to the chase.

42:52.621 --> 42:54.988
Um, that guy ‭who just
walked out of here...

42:55.023 --> 42:56.589
his name is Ernie.

42:56.625 --> 42:58.258
I'm guessing he showed you my picture

42:58.293 --> 43:00.159
and asked if ‭I was
in here the other night.

43:00.195 --> 43:02.996
Now he's going to bring his
boss, who's my brother,

43:03.031 --> 43:05.465
and he's gonna ask
you the same question...

43:05.500 --> 43:07.233
"Did you see that guy the other night?"

43:07.269 --> 43:10.603
Well, the answer is no.

43:10.639 --> 43:13.139
You feel me?

43:14.709 --> 43:16.409
You murder someone?

43:16.444 --> 43:18.144
Nope.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.947
Rob a bank?

43:20.982 --> 43:22.615
No way am I that cool.

43:22.651 --> 43:26.185
I... Sometimes, I go number
two and I don't flush, but...

43:26.221 --> 43:30.023
this is just a thing between brothers.

43:30.058 --> 43:32.325
And we're both lawyers, so...

43:32.360 --> 43:33.660
Right?

43:33.695 --> 43:35.828
I mean, ‭that's a
long and boring story.

43:35.864 --> 43:39.065
You don't wanna know.

43:40.869 --> 43:45.004
Is this gonna get me
jammed up with the cops?

43:45.040 --> 43:49.676
My brotherer mht make it
sound like that, but... no.

43:49.711 --> 43:51.411
It's just family.

43:56.518 --> 43:59.319
Then I feel you.

44:00.989 --> 44:03.523
Hey, ‭tell me about the cameras.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.492
Oh. Uh, they go to a VCR in the back.

44:06.528 --> 44:10.663
It, uh, tapes for 12 hours and
then records over itself.

44:10.699 --> 44:13.032
Right. So I'm on there now?

44:14.603 --> 44:17.670
How hard would it be to erase?

44:17.706 --> 44:20.206
Mm. I dunno.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.976
Could be tricky...

44:23.011 --> 44:24.677
and expensive.

44:24.713 --> 44:27.347
Like 100 bucks expensive?

44:27.382 --> 44:30.049
Like 200 bucks expensive.

44:31.620 --> 44:34.921
You will go far, my young friend.

45:11.393 --> 45:13.426
Uh, good evening.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.528
Uh, Lance, is it?

45:15.563 --> 45:17.363
Yeah.

45:17.399 --> 45:19.132
Lance, I'm Charles McGill.

45:19.167 --> 45:21.934
Uh, my associate, uh,
spoke with you earlier,

45:21.970 --> 45:26.572
and he showed you this photo.

45:26.608 --> 45:29.208
Um, on or about ‭the
morning of the 18th,

45:29.244 --> 45:31.611
this person was here in this shop...

45:31.646 --> 45:32.879
is that correct?

45:32.914 --> 45:34.647
Uh. On or about the...

45:34.683 --> 45:36.749
The 18th, early morning.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.521
No.

45:42.624 --> 45:45.458
Well, I'm... ‭I believe
you told my associate

45:45.493 --> 45:48.161
that he was here and
that he made copies.

45:48.196 --> 45:52.665
Yeah, but sorry.

45:52.701 --> 45:53.933
No.

45:56.204 --> 46:00.473
Yeah, that's my guy.

46:00.508 --> 46:05.478
All right, the, uh, th-the
night of Tuesday the 17th...

46:05.513 --> 46:08.581
leading into early Wednesday,

46:08.616 --> 46:11.250
early hours ‭of Wednesday the 18th...

46:11.286 --> 46:14.787
Were you, in fact,
here? Can we establish that?

46:14.823 --> 46:21.360
Uh, I mean, ‭I work
graveyard, so, yeah.

46:21.396 --> 46:23.830
Stay strong, Lance.

46:23.865 --> 46:27.333
Was this man here, making copies?

46:28.737 --> 46:32.805
It's like I said... I don't think so.

46:32.841 --> 46:34.340
Well, earlier, ‭you
said that he was here.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.808
Now you're saying that he wasn't here.

46:35.844 --> 46:37.210
- Which is it? ‭
- Oh.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.446
Yeah, well, when that
guy showed me the picture,

46:40.482 --> 46:45.017
I thought, "Maybe," but now
that I'm seeing it again, uh...

46:45.053 --> 46:46.352
Ah, sorry.

46:46.387 --> 46:47.887
Don't know what to tell you.

46:47.922 --> 46:49.822
Guess I was wrong.

46:49.858 --> 46:52.992
Son, ‭listen carefully.

46:53.027 --> 46:55.995
I am an officer of the
court, investigating a felony.

46:56.030 --> 46:57.830
So you're a cop?

46:57.866 --> 47:00.233
N-No, I'm not. ‭I'm...
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm...

47:00.268 --> 47:02.535
Mr. McGill, ‭maybe
we better get you home.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.204
Ernesto, do not
speak to me as if I were a child.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.473
I'm fine.

47:16.084 --> 47:17.483
I am not a police officer.

47:17.519 --> 47:18.751
I am an attorney.

47:18.787 --> 47:21.420
And I have a moral and legal obligation

47:21.456 --> 47:23.489
to get to the bottom of this matter.

47:23.525 --> 47:25.191
The bottom of what?

47:25.226 --> 47:29.028
Forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence...

47:31.800 --> 47:33.499
Breaking and entering.

47:33.535 --> 47:35.501
This guy... is he okay?

47:35.537 --> 47:36.890
There's nothing wrong with me!

47:36.891 --> 47:38.291
Mr. McGill, maybe we could just

47:38.315 --> 47:40.006
- take a break and...
- Ernie, shut up!

47:42.443 --> 47:44.710
You think about ‭the
choice you're making.

47:44.746 --> 47:46.679
I already told you he wasn't here.

47:46.714 --> 47:48.281
What do you want me to say?

47:48.316 --> 47:50.683
I want you to speak the truth.

47:50.718 --> 47:52.351
I know he was here!

47:52.387 --> 47:54.053
I know what he did!

47:54.088 --> 47:56.355
Tell me what you told Ernesto.

47:56.391 --> 47:58.591
Stop trying to change your story.

47:58.626 --> 48:01.460
Excuse me. Sorry. How do
we get this to do 11x14?

48:01.496 --> 48:02.728
No, excuse me!

48:02.764 --> 48:04.197
Are having a conversation here!

48:04.500 --> 48:05.899
You got to switch it to tray four.

48:06.067 --> 48:07.733
It's easier if I show you. Look.

48:12.340 --> 48:14.040
Dude, okay.

48:14.075 --> 48:16.309
I-I... I-I
don't want any problems here.

48:16.344 --> 48:20.279
So, just... get him out of here,

48:20.315 --> 48:22.048
or I'm gonna call the cops, okay?

48:22.083 --> 48:23.916
Do not walk away from
me! We are not finished here!

48:23.952 --> 48:27.320
I am done talking to you, man!

48:48.509 --> 48:51.410
Call 911.

48:51.446 --> 48:55.234
Call 911. Come on.
