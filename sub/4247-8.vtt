00:05.605 --> 00:08.340
(lock whirs and beeps)

00:08.342 --> 00:10.075
(door creaks)

00:10.077 --> 00:11.377
(chair scrapes floor)

00:11.379 --> 00:15.014
Our daughter's
been asking about you.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.783
I wish I could say
they were innocent questions,

00:17.785 --> 00:19.418
Such as trying to find out
what lullabies you sang

00:19.420 --> 00:21.453
Or what cookies you made
when she was sad.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.155
They're not.
So tomorrow night--

00:23.157 --> 00:25.090
When america is sleeping--
I'm putting you on a plane

00:25.092 --> 00:26.692
And taking you
out of the country.

00:26.694 --> 00:30.029
It is not a vacation
or even a change of scenery.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.230
The room
you'll be occupying

00:31.232 --> 00:32.631
Is much like the room
you're in now,

00:32.633 --> 00:35.367
Only further away
and harder to find.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.602
Understand?

00:38.271 --> 00:39.438
Good.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.143
I want to see her.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.544
Excuse me?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.613
Olivia--I want to see her.
I want to see my daughter,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.082
And I want you
to make it happen

00:50.084 --> 00:53.819
Before I travel
to some godforsaken room

00:53.821 --> 00:55.387
In some godforsaken country

00:55.389 --> 00:57.823
To spend the rest
of my godforsaken life there.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.391
You know that's not possible.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.161
Then make it possible.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.229
I've been sitting in this cell
for over 20 years,

01:04.231 --> 01:07.166
Hiding in the <i>bowels</i>
<i>of our justice system.</i>

01:07.168 --> 01:08.834
You have to give me
something--

01:08.836 --> 01:13.138
One thing--before you
throw me out with the trash.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.339
Please.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.780
Sorry.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.116
Eli, please.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.152
Eli. <i>Eli!</i>

01:27.154 --> 01:39.364
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

01:39.366 --> 01:40.566
(engine turns off)

01:40.568 --> 01:41.867
Hey, you're up, robin.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.369
Oh, come on.
It'll be easy.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.205
You go to work
and tell me about your day--

01:46.207 --> 01:47.539
All the details.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.809
Except I'll actually listen
to what you have to say.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.812
Oh, come on, don't make me
give you the speech.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.514
What speech?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.349
You know, the one where I say,
"you don't have a choice"

01:57.351 --> 02:00.185
Or "you'll be begging me
to kill you," blah, blah, blah.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.587
Except I'll say it all scary
and threatening,

02:01.589 --> 02:04.756
Most likely with a gun
down your throat. (sighs)

02:06.326 --> 02:08.594
Come on. I'll do it
if I have to,

02:08.596 --> 02:11.230
But it's much more fun
to pretend I'm your boyfriend.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.167
(chuckles)

02:20.673 --> 02:23.775
(breathing heavily)

02:23.777 --> 02:24.843
<i>(quinn) do you have</i>
<i>another pen?</i>

02:24.845 --> 02:27.246
<i>Try this one. (grunts)</i>

02:28.448 --> 02:30.349
<i>No! Oh, my god.</i>

02:30.351 --> 02:31.917
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

02:34.587 --> 02:36.355
(harrison) does anyone else
feel like w'ere chasing a ghost?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.589
Sorry I'm late.
Fender bender.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.891
Forgiven. You brought
the good stuff.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.626
The last person to see
omar dresden

02:40.628 --> 02:43.295
Before he disappears
off the grid ends up dead?

02:43.297 --> 02:44.663
We were close.
(cell phone chimes)

02:44.665 --> 02:46.365
Dresden's out there.
I know it.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.900
Olivia pope.

02:47.902 --> 02:52.171
Josie marcus needs us.
The rest of you track down

02:52.173 --> 02:53.338
Whoever killed
the security guard.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.640
That's our new lead.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.608
The cops said the security
footage from the building

02:56.610 --> 02:58.177
Where the guard was killed
is missing.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.112
I'm checking other buildings
in the area now.

03:00.114 --> 03:01.547
How'd they take this guy out?
Professional hit--

03:01.549 --> 03:03.248
A lethal dose of
botulinum toxin.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.683
There's at least a dozen
other buildings in the area.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.518
Maybe their cams have a view
of the lobby.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.220
Okay, we get our hands
on that footage,

03:08.222 --> 03:09.922
We get our killer.
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:11.891 --> 03:13.825
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:13.827 --> 03:15.327
(cyrus) hi, honey.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.262
How was your day?
(sighs)

03:17.264 --> 03:18.830
(kisses)

03:18.832 --> 03:22.834
James...
You don't care
about my day, cyrus.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.704
That's not true.
Really?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.906
You wanna hear
about the new graph paper

03:27.908 --> 03:29.741
I bought for
ella's poop log...

03:29.743 --> 03:30.976
Or the riveting conversation

03:30.978 --> 03:32.544
I had with the head
of the h.O.A.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.979
Our neighbor's sprinklers
are coming on

03:33.981 --> 03:36.215
4 times a day,
15 minutes at a time--

03:36.217 --> 03:37.716
Completely against code.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.518
I had to stand outside
with a stopwatch all day.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.752
But hey, at least we know

03:40.754 --> 03:42.387
What's killing
that strawberry tree.
Good.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.655
That thing's an eyesore.
I need more wine.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.891
You want to know
how my day was?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.726
(sets down glass)
(sighs)

03:47.728 --> 03:49.861
It was fine.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.530
Good, I suppose.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.999
Got a call right before I headed
home from donnie weston.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.002
You know donnie,
over at the "d.C. Times"

03:57.004 --> 04:01.373
Anyway, I guess they want
to do some puff piece

04:01.375 --> 04:03.709
On the vice president's
husband.

04:03.711 --> 04:07.246
They're looking for a writer,
wanted a recommendation.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.881
So I...

04:09.883 --> 04:12.918
You know what?
Forget I said anything.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.455
Cyrus...
No, I wasn't thinking.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.859
I will call donnie back
first thing tomorrow morning.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.894
I'll tell--I'll tell him.
Cyrus!

04:22.896 --> 04:24.963
Yes, james,
I gave him your name.

04:24.965 --> 04:28.433
A piece like this
is totally beneath you.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.701
And I should have
asked you first,

04:29.703 --> 04:31.903
But I was so caught up
in the moment--
cyrus!

04:31.905 --> 04:34.606
This is <i>amazing.</i>

04:34.608 --> 04:35.941
Yeah?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.944
So...

04:38.946 --> 04:40.712
You're interested?
Are you kidding me?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.681
I'm beyond.
I wasn't sure.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.884
I know this isn't the kind
of journalism you do.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.886
(sighs) but at least
it's a chance

04:47.888 --> 04:50.422
To show those bastards
at b.N.C.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.890
The kind of access you have

04:51.892 --> 04:54.660
So they'll regret
screwing you over.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.729
You will have to spend
a good amount of time

04:57.731 --> 05:01.366
With daniel douglas langston.
That's fine.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.002
I actually find
his hillbilly thing...

05:04.004 --> 05:05.037
Charming.

05:05.039 --> 05:09.074
No, cy... Thank you.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.777
Thank you.
(moans)

05:11.779 --> 05:14.079
(kisses)

05:14.081 --> 05:16.548
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
(candace) someone broke in
while we were at dinner.

05:16.550 --> 05:21.720
What'd they take?
Just my laptop.
It had strategy memos,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.655
Donor contacts,
stump speeches...
Yeah.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.690
And they didn't touch
the jewelry,

05:24.692 --> 05:28.560
It's reston. You know it is,
and now he has everything.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.661
That's a <i>big</i> accusation.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.896
We don't know
who did this yet.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.397
Really, we don't?
We're a week out from iowa

05:32.399 --> 05:34.700
And leading him in the polls
for the first time.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.936
I just think we should hold
a presser, something.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.338
We can't let him
get away with this.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.707
We want the authorities
pointing the finger at him,

05:41.709 --> 05:44.710
I'll call the cops,
file an official report.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.844
I got this.
Abby?

05:45.846 --> 05:50.849
And    <i>y</i>have a full day
of campaigning tomorrow.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.453
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

05:54.455 --> 05:56.621
<i>With all due respect, carla,</i>
<i>that wasn't a question.</i>

05:56.623 --> 05:57.989
<i>It was an attack.</i>
<i>(carla) sir--</i>

05:57.991 --> 05:59.958
<i>Ask my wife</i>
<i>anything you want.</i>

05:59.960 --> 06:01.727
<i>She is more than capable</i>
<i>of handling it herself.</i>

06:01.729 --> 06:03.428
But if you want to attack her--

06:03.430 --> 06:07.866
Mr. President--
I <i>had the affair.</i>

06:07.868 --> 06:09.901
You okay?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.937
<i>(fitz) I damaged our marriage.</i>

06:11.939 --> 06:13.805
<i>(woman) tomorrow,</i>
<i>president grant...</i>
<i>Don't wait up.</i>

06:13.807 --> 06:16.641
<i>Where he will kick off</i>
<i>his campaign</i>

06:16.643 --> 06:19.044
<i>With town hall meetings.</i>
<i>(turns tv off)</i>

07:34.021 --> 07:35.487
Here you go, roger.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.990
On your camera.
Ours have been malfunctioning

07:38.992 --> 07:41.760
Ever since that security guard
across the street died,

07:41.762 --> 07:43.028
They've been coming down
hard on us

07:43.030 --> 07:44.729
To make sure everything's
fully operational.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.665
Those things are sensitive.
It's been pretty hot out lately.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.033
Maybe that's your problem.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.234
Hmm,
I didn't think of that.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.677
What are you doing?

07:58.679 --> 08:00.679
Snaking
the surveillance footage.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.947
Thought
I'd get a jump on it.

08:01.949 --> 08:06.485
Look at you,
being all proactive.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.752
(chuckles) right?

08:07.754 --> 08:09.020
Huck doesn't give me
enough credit.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.494
(man) the guard who delivers
her meals found her,

08:15.496 --> 08:16.695
Managed to stop
the bleeding.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.763
Is she well enough
to transport?

08:18.765 --> 08:19.965
She's lost a lot of blood,

08:19.967 --> 08:21.967
But moving her
shouldn't be a problem.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.768
Physically,
she'll be okay.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.237
And mentally?

08:25.239 --> 08:27.706
She ate her own wrist, sir.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.641
Most people would have
passed out after a few bites,

08:29.643 --> 08:33.712
She just kept chewing
till she found an artery.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.913
Whatever drove her
to do this,

08:34.915 --> 08:37.849
Whatever demons
she's wrestling with,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.050
They're still there.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.920
Thank you, doctor.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.531
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

08:52.533 --> 08:54.533
Josie marcus needs justice.
She demands it, david.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.767
And would this justice
come in the form

08:55.769 --> 08:58.270
Of say...
A photo op of the f.B.I.

08:58.272 --> 09:01.206
I thought we agreed
to keep our business dealings

09:01.208 --> 09:04.809
In my professional opinion,
you and your fellow pope-heads

09:04.811 --> 09:07.012
Would do or say anything
to win iowa,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.147
Including strong-arming
your boyfriend.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.315
David, I can't emphasize
this enough--

09:10.317 --> 09:11.683
What happened today--

09:11.685 --> 09:15.287
Or a run-of-the-mill burglar
who knew nobody was home.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.255
They <i>stole</i> campaign files
and left the flat screens.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.758
What run-of-the-mill burglar
does that?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.626
Even if I concede you
that point--

09:21.628 --> 09:23.762
Which is a big "if"--
it doesn't mean it was reston.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.831
You know I can't search
his or anyone else's office

09:26.833 --> 09:28.066
Without probable cause.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.601
So in the meantime,
you do nothing?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.870
I let the capitol hill police
do their job.

09:31.872 --> 09:36.675
F.Y.I., the hypnosis
isn't working.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.043
You need to start using
the snore clips again,

09:38.045 --> 09:39.678
Or you're back on the couch.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.279
Just my professional opinion.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.148
(door opens)

09:43.150 --> 09:45.283
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

09:45.285 --> 09:48.720
James is on board
for a nice long profile piece

09:48.722 --> 09:52.624
Of daniel douglas langston--
an <i>intimate portrait.</i>

09:52.626 --> 09:53.825
This...

09:53.827 --> 09:55.794
I'd say this is
a new low.
Not for me.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.996
At least admit
you're losing your mind.
Hmm.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.931
The plan is simple.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.766
Daniel douglas will make
a pass at my husband.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.202
My husband will refuse
said pass,

10:04.204 --> 10:05.870
Slap his closeted face,

10:05.872 --> 10:07.739
And then when james
wants to write about it--

10:07.741 --> 10:09.908
To expose the hypocritical lie
that is their marriage--

10:09.910 --> 10:11.776
I will tell sally
that she can either

10:11.778 --> 10:16.247
Or she can continue to run
for office as an independent

10:16.249 --> 10:18.183
And read james' sordid account
in the "times"

10:21.087 --> 10:22.887
There is nothing simple
about that plan.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.756
I mean, how on earth
can you be sure

10:24.758 --> 10:26.825
That daniel douglas
will make a pass at james?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.294
Oh, I can't.
But you can.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.762
(sighs) ugh.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.831
(indistinct conversations)

10:32.833 --> 10:33.999
Daniel douglas!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.200
What brings you
to the west wing

10:35.202 --> 10:36.701
When your better half's
out of town?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.637
I got that interview
with d.C. "times."

10:38.639 --> 10:40.105
James thought we should
do it in her office.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.373
I think it's gonna be
one of those...
(chuckles)

10:41.375 --> 10:43.274
"what's-it-like-
to-be-married-to-power"

10:43.276 --> 10:45.844
Kind of things. You must have
that angle down pat.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.680
You got any tips
for this old alligator hunter?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.415
Oh, you'll be fine.
It's with james.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.751
He's so respectful
and so kind.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.786
He's practically family.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.421
I remember when he and cyrus
got together--

10:56.423 --> 10:59.891
Which, to be honest,
I didn't understand.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.193
I mean, I love cyrus.
We all do, but...

11:02.195 --> 11:03.862
He's so much <i>older.</i>

11:03.864 --> 11:06.731
Yeah, what's up with that?
(chuckles)

11:06.733 --> 11:07.999
(singsongy) well...

11:08.001 --> 11:10.068
(normal voice)
you didn't hear it from me,

11:10.070 --> 11:13.705
But one of the beat reporters
told me once...

11:13.707 --> 11:16.808
(normal voice) then suddenly
it all made sense.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.811
You don't say?
(chuckles) I know.
It's not fair, right?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.713
Don't the gays
just have all the fun?

11:21.715 --> 11:22.747
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

11:22.749 --> 11:24.716
(typing)

11:24.718 --> 11:26.017
(footsteps approach)

11:26.019 --> 11:27.786
Any luck I.D.-Ing
our murderer?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.854
Not yet.
But we've got seven
different camera angles

11:29.856 --> 11:32.323
We'll find whoever
killed that security guard.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.758
Unless, you know,
whoever did this

11:33.760 --> 11:37.696
We need hard proof
that reston was behind it

11:37.698 --> 11:39.297
So we can convince david
to pull the f.B.I. In,

11:39.299 --> 11:42.200
Turn the footage
you're working on over to huck.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.235
Actually, I'm kind of
in a groove here. So--
give it.

11:44.237 --> 11:50.842
<i>But I think it's obvious</i>
<i>who had the motive.</i>

11:50.844 --> 11:52.877
<i>And whoever broke in</i>
<i>left the silver</i>

11:52.879 --> 11:54.913
<i>And only took the files</i>
<i>that could shine a light</i>

11:54.915 --> 11:56.815
<i>On our strategy</i>
<i>and infrastructure</i>

11:56.817 --> 12:00.485
<i>So you</i> are <i>accusing</i>
<i>the reston campaign?</i>
<i>No comment.</i>

12:02.788 --> 12:05.724
On it.
(cell phone rings)

12:05.726 --> 12:08.359
(sighs)
(ring)

12:08.361 --> 12:09.394
What?!
Liv?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.329
We need to talk.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.500
In fact, that's exactly
what we need to <i>stop</i> doing.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.869
I'm asking you for an hour.
One hour.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.738
I think you owe me
at least that.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.074
After what you did,
I don't owe you anything.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.977
So you need
to   <i>stop calling me.</i>

12:30.850 --> 12:32.751
(thuds and clanks)

12:32.753 --> 12:33.885
(grunting) aah!

12:35.321 --> 12:37.889
Aah!
(shatters)

12:37.891 --> 12:41.993
(sobbing)

12:41.995 --> 12:43.495
(sniffles)

12:43.497 --> 12:45.530
(door closes)
you really think
that's gonna do it?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.866
(breathing heavily)

12:47.868 --> 12:50.935
That won't stop him
from calling.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.872
The president wants
to talk to you...

12:53.874 --> 12:55.306
He'll find a way
to do it.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.448
(knock on door)

13:03.450 --> 13:04.983
Hey.
You screwed up.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.318
You went on tv
and played the blame game.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.287
That, my friend... Not smart.
(door closes)

13:09.289 --> 13:11.990
Not wise at all. <i>Why?</i>

13:11.992 --> 13:13.258
Someone needed to point
the finger at reston--

13:13.260 --> 13:15.293
Because we told you
<i>not to.</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:17.328
We told you
we had a plan, candace,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.430
That we would handle it,
in our own time,

13:19.432 --> 13:21.232
In our own way.
And you going rogue on this

13:21.234 --> 13:22.567
Makes getting your sister
elected to the highest office

13:22.569 --> 13:25.303
In the land--a job that you
hired us to do--

13:25.305 --> 13:27.272
That much harder!
(pounds fist)

13:27.274 --> 13:29.908
Guess what? She's a first-term
congresswoman

13:29.910 --> 13:34.179
From a forgettable state.
It doesn't <i>need to be harder!</i>

13:34.181 --> 13:37.348
So from now on,
you are gonna mind your elders.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.583
You're gonna color
inside the lines,

13:38.585 --> 13:40.418
And you're gonna do exactly
what I say

13:40.420 --> 13:43.221
When I say to do it
and not one second before.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.389
Am I clear?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.224
So are you here
to babysit me now?

13:46.226 --> 13:49.060
I'll let you stay up
past your bedtime.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.930
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

13:51.932 --> 13:56.100
Can't we just let it run
until she comes out?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.136
The memory card
must have been corrupted.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.871
We lose the image
a few minutes after she enters.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.473
In a cheap skirt suit
and dumpy heels?

14:02.475 --> 14:03.541
(jake) wait, what's that?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.076
There, as she's going in.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.144
Is that her reflection
in the door?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.579
Can you...
Blow it up and scrub it?

14:07.581 --> 14:09.848
Yeah, I can run
a re-pixelation program.

14:09.850 --> 14:10.982
It'll take time,
but it should yield

14:10.984 --> 14:12.183
A clear image
in a day or two.

14:12.185 --> 14:16.221
It uses an algorithm
to alter the--
I wasn't actually asking.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.189
Where are you with tracking
down candi's laptop?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.591
Uh, I-I can't locate
the I.P. Address

14:19.593 --> 14:21.593
Until someone logs on.

14:21.595 --> 14:22.627
They have something?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.095
A reflection
of the killer.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.296
They're re-something
something.

14:25.298 --> 14:30.468
Oh, wait,
someone logged on.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.170
Georgetown.
Can we get an address?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.304
Give me a second.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.607
3600 willgoose avenue.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.376
I think it's...
Reston's campaign
headquarters.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.978
<i>(david)</i>
<i>the marcus campaign</i>

14:39.980 --> 14:42.013
<i>Has informed</i>
<i>the department of justice</i>

14:42.015 --> 14:43.615
<i>That the missing laptop</i>
<i>contains</i>

14:43.617 --> 14:46.184
<i>Confidential election</i>
<i>material.</i>

14:46.186 --> 14:47.986
<i>Responding to a tip,</i>
<i>the f.B.I., earlier today,</i>

14:47.988 --> 14:51.656
<i>Recovered this laptop from</i>
<i>reston campaign headquarters.</i>

14:51.658 --> 14:54.025
<i>The u.S. Attorney's office</i>
<i>will continue to investigate</i>

14:54.027 --> 14:57.228
<i>These circumstances</i>
<i>to determine what, if any,</i>

14:57.230 --> 14:59.530
<i>Federal electoral laws</i>
<i>may have been violated,</i>

14:59.532 --> 15:02.467
<i>And, if so, who were</i>
<i>the parties responsible.</i>

15:02.469 --> 15:03.568
I'm looking at you,
governor reston.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.371
Who's the canny
campaign manager now?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.406
Mnh-mnh. No one likes
a sore winner.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.309
Now we don't have
to go to the press.
They come to us.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.111
And we demand that reston
drops out.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.445
We say, "no comment."
no accusations,

15:14.447 --> 15:15.580
No calls for resignation.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.115
We let the new york times
do that.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.449
We stay above the fray.
(cell phone chimes)

15:18.451 --> 15:20.318
Exactly.
This is the "times"
calling now.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.388
(beep)
olivia pope.

15:23.390 --> 15:27.058
We have no statement
to make at this time.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.226
Thanks.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.362
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

15:31.364 --> 15:33.498
All the man wanted to do
was talk about college football.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.133
I'm sorry, honey.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.668
I hate college football!
I hate <i>all</i> football!

15:36.670 --> 15:38.636
I tried everything--
syria, health care,

15:38.638 --> 15:40.705
Immigration reform,
the economy--

15:40.707 --> 15:42.974
It all seemed to come back
to freakin' college football.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.475
James, this is a puff piece
on the guy.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.977
You don't have to dig
too deep.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.211
You have
a couple more days.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.080
Just get to know him
a little better.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.082
He's probably uncomfortable
talking to reporters,

15:51.084 --> 15:53.084
And he's clamming up.
Where'd you meet with him today?

15:53.086 --> 15:56.955
I figured that would be
the most professional.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.359
No wonder you had a hard time
getting the man to open up.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.162
He's probably worried
about saying the wrong thing

16:04.164 --> 16:06.331
With his uptight wife's
loyal staff

16:06.333 --> 16:07.732
Just 2 feet away?
(chuckles)

16:07.734 --> 16:09.600
I'm sure sally
has trained him pretty well.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.436
She's got the poor guy
tethered to a metal stake

16:11.438 --> 16:13.338
In the backyard.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.540
Sit with him on his turf.
Go over to his place.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.977
No, forget the stuffy
business suit,

16:18.979 --> 16:20.445
<i>And...</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:23.648
(hangers clatter)
wear the new plum v-neck
you bought,

16:23.650 --> 16:25.450
Make it <i>casual.</i>

16:25.452 --> 16:27.251
Bring over a bottle
of nice bourbon,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.120
Have a drink or two...

16:29.122 --> 16:31.356
He'll open right up.
(kisses)

16:31.358 --> 16:32.557
Mark my words.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.427
I know what you're doing,
cyrus.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.497
You were mean to me
when I was fired,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.165
And you feel guilty.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.501
I do. I--

16:43.503 --> 16:44.769
I feel guilty.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.037
Well, don't.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.473
You have more than
made up for it.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.510
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

16:52.512 --> 16:54.746
(beeps)

16:57.416 --> 17:00.251
(knock on door)

17:00.253 --> 17:01.786
(door closes)
you wanted to see me?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.554
Where are we
with olivia pope?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.456
She's still barking
up the omar dresden tree.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.657
They're ice cold.
And the girl?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.393
Doing great.
Good little spy.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.028
I want her to report
on every detail

17:10.030 --> 17:11.429
Of what happens
in that office.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.032
If she gets caught
in the process,

17:14.034 --> 17:17.468
You do as you were told.

17:17.470 --> 17:21.039
No worries, boss.
I got it.

17:25.110 --> 17:26.377
(door opens)

17:26.379 --> 17:29.547
(door closes)

17:38.123 --> 17:39.357
(monitor beeping steadily)
(coughing)

17:39.359 --> 17:42.226
(sniffs and grunts)

17:42.228 --> 17:44.228
(breathes heavily
and whimpers)

17:44.230 --> 17:45.530
Where am I?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.398
Somewhere you can't
hurt yourself.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.536
(continues coughing)

17:51.538 --> 17:54.072
(monitor continues
beeping steadily)

17:56.608 --> 17:58.576
(inhales and exhales sharply)
here.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.146
I brought something
for you.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.115
(sniffles)

18:09.221 --> 18:11.722
(gasps faintly)

18:11.724 --> 18:14.392
(whispers) oh, my lord.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.495
That's your daughter.
That's olivia.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.199
(chuckles)

18:21.201 --> 18:24.302
(gasps)

18:24.304 --> 18:28.539
She's beautiful.
Mm-hmm.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.510
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

18:32.512 --> 18:33.478
(elevator bell dings)

18:35.347 --> 18:36.781
Miss pope, there's
a helicopter waiting for you.

18:36.783 --> 18:41.452
Ma'am...
You go back and tell him
I <i>won't</i> be summoned.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.488
Ma'am...
Tom, I'm not going,
so good-bye.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.490
(keys jangling)
the president instructed me
to give this to you.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.325
I am just doing my job.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.392
Ma'am.

18:48.394 --> 18:52.130
(sighs)

18:57.669 --> 18:59.804
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:02.741 --> 19:05.810
(helicopter blades whirring)

19:18.757 --> 19:20.191
One hour.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.893
One hour.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.434
It's a beautiful house.
New, but built to last.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.703
The ceilings are made
from local wood--vermont pine.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.939
And the fieldstone
fireplace--

19:34.941 --> 19:37.208
They did that by hand.
(crackling)

19:37.210 --> 19:39.210
This where you're staying?
No.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.779
It's not really
ready to live in.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.648
It needs a good cleaning--

19:43.650 --> 19:45.483
Fitz,
what are we doing here?

19:45.485 --> 19:48.252
You're supposed to be
in new hampshire.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.422
There's a skylight
made of stained glass

19:51.424 --> 19:54.759
Designed by this <i>amazing</i>
<i>local artist.</i>

19:59.665 --> 20:02.900
My father is not
a subject I discuss...

20:02.902 --> 20:03.968
<i>Ever.</i>

20:03.970 --> 20:06.370
When I met you--

20:06.372 --> 20:07.972
At that point
in my life--

20:07.974 --> 20:10.641
I didn't even feel like
I  <i>had</i>a father.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.777
And how would I have told you?
What are the right words?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.412
"nice to meet you,
governor grant.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.947
"my father runs
the nation's top secret

20:15.949 --> 20:17.648
Government spy organization."

20:17.650 --> 20:19.250
That's exactly what
you were supposed to tell me

20:19.252 --> 20:20.918
Because I was gonna
be president,

20:20.920 --> 20:23.321
And that was information
I needed to know.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.755
I didn't know you were
going to be president.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.292
I was gonna win.
Well, how about after you knew?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.994
How about after
you fixed the election?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.929
Maybe you could have
told me then?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.265
Or how about after I told you
I was in love with you?

20:34.267 --> 20:39.237
How about after I tried to
give up the white house for you?

20:39.239 --> 20:42.473
You know who I am, liv.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.875
You know everything.
<i>Not</i> everything--

20:44.877 --> 20:47.478
Everything I could
legally tell you.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.614
You know who I am,

20:49.616 --> 20:52.250
And you're just this <i>bundle</i>
<i>of dirty little secrets.</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:02.660
(voice breaking)
if I told you about him--

21:02.662 --> 21:05.930
If you knew who I was--

21:05.932 --> 21:08.532
You would have run
in the other direction.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.967
I wouldn't have run.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.602
I would have protected you.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.504
I don't need protecting!

21:13.506 --> 21:16.641
I am <i>not</i> the girl you save.
I am fine!

21:16.643 --> 21:18.342
My father runs the nation's

21:18.344 --> 21:20.511
Top secret government
spy organization.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.713
One order,
and you shot down

21:22.715 --> 21:26.884
A plane
with 329 people on it.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.820
You're the one
who needs protecting!

21:29.822 --> 21:32.023
I fixed the election,
he's my father,

21:32.025 --> 21:34.325
I ruined <i>you.</i>

21:40.332 --> 21:41.799
(sighs)

21:44.636 --> 21:46.037
The house has orchards.
Oh, my god.

21:46.039 --> 21:48.906
30 acres.
(chuckles)

21:48.908 --> 21:52.510
This incredible greenhouse
just off the kitchen,

21:52.512 --> 21:54.979
You should see the kitchen,
these marble countertops

21:54.981 --> 21:57.748
That are from a quarry
just up the road--

21:57.750 --> 22:00.651
Stop talking
about the house!

22:03.021 --> 22:04.689
I just...

22:06.958 --> 22:09.093
I wanted you to see it
at least once.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.795
What is this place?

22:10.797 --> 22:13.097
Why am I here?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.066
Why the <i>hell</i>
<i>are we out here</i>

22:15.068 --> 22:17.101
In the middle of nowhere?!

22:17.103 --> 22:19.804
This house is yours...

22:19.806 --> 22:21.405
Ours.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.940
I had it built for us.

22:25.577 --> 22:29.113
When it looked like
there was a chance for us...

22:29.115 --> 22:32.750
I bought the land,
and I had it built.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.986
I couldn't really be mayor,
but... (chuckles)

22:35.988 --> 22:42.360
And there are bedrooms
for lots of kids.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.438
This was going to be
you and me raising a family

22:54.440 --> 22:59.009
And growing old together
in this house.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.711
It was supposed to be
our house, livvie.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.049
And I just wanted you
to see it at least once--

23:05.051 --> 23:09.420
At least once
before I sell it.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.756
I wanted you to see
the dream.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.402
(gasps)

23:34.079 --> 23:36.147
(exhales)

23:41.019 --> 23:42.887
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

23:50.128 --> 23:52.129
You need any help?
No, you can go.

23:52.131 --> 23:59.670
I can do the night shift, if--
if you wanna go home.
You can go.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.773
I know you do a good job.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.109
Jake said I don't tell you,
and he's right,

24:05.111 --> 24:08.078
I don't tell <i>you,</i>
<i>but I know you do a good job.</i>

24:08.080 --> 24:10.147
I should tell you
more often.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.120
That's okay.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.658
(footsteps depart)

24:23.762 --> 24:25.729
Ah. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

24:25.731 --> 24:26.764
You got some dirt for me?

24:26.766 --> 24:28.098
Robin...

24:28.100 --> 24:29.733
They're about to find out
about me.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.569
You're good at this.
You'll figure something out.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.037
Get the gun out of my face,
will ya?

24:33.039 --> 24:35.606
(gun clicks)
I could kill you right now.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.808
Yeah, and?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.210
You think I'm the one
runnin' this thing?

24:39.212 --> 24:41.078
You kill me, you'll get
another handler

24:41.080 --> 24:42.646
By the time my body
hits the ground.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.582
And I'm the best handler
you're ever gonna get.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.217
(sighs)

24:46.219 --> 24:48.018
Because I like you.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.521
And despite what you're trying
to tell yourself right now,

24:50.523 --> 24:53.891
You like me, too.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.193
(opens car door)

24:58.129 --> 25:00.664
(car door closes,
engine starts)

25:00.666 --> 25:03.167
(maya) look at these
skinny little legs.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.269
And these cheeks.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.105
(chuckles) my god.
You just wanna eat her.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.874
Ooh!
(laughs)

25:09.876 --> 25:12.109
(laughs)

25:12.111 --> 25:14.745
So where are the photos?
What photos?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.714
The ones you've been taking
because you're her father.

25:16.716 --> 25:17.915
These are all
press clippings.

25:17.917 --> 25:18.983
It's all I could find.

25:18.985 --> 25:22.152
(monitor beeping steadily)

25:22.154 --> 25:24.822
Some more water?

25:24.824 --> 25:26.123
(water pouring)

25:26.125 --> 25:27.858
(object thuds)

25:27.860 --> 25:29.059
What did you do to her?

25:29.061 --> 25:30.594
I didn't do anything.
Really?

25:30.596 --> 25:32.296
So for the past
twenty-something christmases

25:32.298 --> 25:34.064
And thanksgivings,
there are photos

25:34.066 --> 25:36.100
Of the two of you drinking
eggnog and eating turkey.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.768
They're in your house
somewhere.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.236
You just misplaced them.
Is that what you're saying?

25:39.238 --> 25:40.871
(sets down glass)

25:40.873 --> 25:42.540
I told you
to take care of her.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.008
We grew apart.
She was 12.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.543
And I provided for her.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.677
Providing for someone
and being a parent

25:46.679 --> 25:47.978
Are two different things.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.581
You're one to talk.
I beg your pardon.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.283
You heard me.

25:52.285 --> 25:55.853
"hush-a-bye."
what?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.054
That was the lullaby
I sang to her

25:57.056 --> 25:58.789
When she was a baby.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.558
And it wasn't cookies
I made when she was sad.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.127
It was popcorn.
She never liked sweets.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.062
That was olivia
twenty-some odd years ago.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.731
The olivia who's out there
today, you know nothing about.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.199
Zero, and don't forget
for a <i>second</i>

26:09.201 --> 26:11.235
Whose fault that is.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.672
Doctor!

26:16.107 --> 26:17.575
I'll be moving the prisoner
tomorrow evening.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.077
Please make sure
she is fully sedated.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.845
Yes, sir.

26:23.181 --> 26:26.317
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

26:26.319 --> 26:28.118
Lauren, I tried
calling the president.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.587
I couldn't reach him
at his hotel.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.621
Has his schedule changed?

26:30.623 --> 26:32.723
No, ma'am.
Huh.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.725
Could you try calling him
for me, please?
Yes, ma'am.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.794
Teddy said the word
"balloon" today.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.631
His son does during the day,
there's hell to pay. (giggles)

26:40.633 --> 26:43.968
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's not answering.
(receiver clatters)

26:43.970 --> 26:46.203
I could try
his cell phone.
Great.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.005
(bill withers) ¶ ain't no
sunshine when she's gone ¶

26:48.007 --> 26:51.141
¶ and she's always gone

26:51.143 --> 26:54.979
¶ anytime she goes away

27:03.855 --> 27:09.793
¶ wonder if
she's gone to stay ¶

27:09.795 --> 27:13.130
¶ ain't no sunshine

27:13.132 --> 27:15.132

27:28.014 --> 27:31.248

27:37.189 --> 27:39.957

27:39.959 --> 27:42.693
No luck there,
either, ma'am.
(receiver clatters)

27:42.695 --> 27:44.895
Lauren, would you call
olivia pope for me, please?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.196
Ma'am?

27:46.198 --> 27:49.166
Olivia pope?
Would you call her, please?

27:49.168 --> 27:51.769
¶ ain't no sunshine

27:51.771 --> 27:55.272

28:04.884 --> 28:07.184
(ring)
ms. Pope isn't answering
either, ma'am.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.186
Thank you, lauren.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.959
(groans)

28:15.961 --> 28:19.063
(helicopter approaching)

28:19.065 --> 28:20.931
Liv?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.001
(sighs)

28:24.003 --> 28:25.803
That's my ride.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.905
(sighs)

28:28.840 --> 28:31.408
Could you?

28:31.410 --> 28:36.447
(kisses) stay another day.
We could hide out here.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.415
Mm.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.018
I have to go.
I have work.

28:41.020 --> 28:45.155
And you have to go.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.990
You have a world to run.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.259
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

28:51.930 --> 28:53.764
(sighs)

28:57.836 --> 29:00.938
What?

29:00.940 --> 29:02.806
I love you.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.375
Fitz, I really do
have to go--

29:05.377 --> 29:07.478
No, I'm saying...

29:09.814 --> 29:11.181
Your father
has to be stopped.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.984
And I want you to know
before I stop him.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.753
I want you to hear me
when I say that I love you

29:15.755 --> 29:17.888
No matter what happens.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.923
Because I need answers.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.359
I was ordered to shoot down
that plane.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.393
And after
I get those answers...

29:23.395 --> 29:25.262
Do what you have to do.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.463
You're sure?

29:26.465 --> 29:27.898
He's your father.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.900
He's the head of b613.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.770
He knows what
he signed up for.

29:32.772 --> 29:37.074
Do what you have to do.

29:37.076 --> 29:41.178
Because I'm not gonna stop
until I have answers either.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.173
(sighs)

30:09.175 --> 30:12.242
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:25.323 --> 30:28.225
Don't sell the house.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.127
Not yet.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.575
All right, got it.
Thanks, brian.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.443
I'll be in soon.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.845
(beep)

30:51.182 --> 30:53.450
What?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.452
That was my computer guy.
And?

30:55.454 --> 30:58.088
Since we're in bed and this
isn't a business dealing,

30:58.090 --> 30:59.890
I am gonna pretend
we're a normal couple

30:59.892 --> 31:02.326
And not automatically suspect
you and your co-workers

31:02.328 --> 31:04.595
Of committing election fraud...
Again.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.330
What are you
talking about?

31:06.332 --> 31:07.965
My computer guy says

31:07.967 --> 31:10.901
Is a stump speech
and a few donor addresses--

31:10.903 --> 31:13.203
Nothing that would really
help an opposing campaign.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.439
That's weird.
Not really.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.974
Especially when you consider
that there used to be

31:16.976 --> 31:18.976
A lot more on that computer,
but it was wiped clean

31:18.978 --> 31:20.277
The day
before the break-in.

31:20.279 --> 31:23.113
You can't think that...

31:23.115 --> 31:26.083
David, are you accusing me
of faking a burglary,

31:26.085 --> 31:27.517
And then
planting that laptop

31:27.519 --> 31:28.652
In reston's campaign
headquarters?

31:28.654 --> 31:30.654
No, no, I am not.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.591
Ask their girlfriends
first thing in the morning.
Good.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.960
Because I didn't do that,
and neither did liv.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.528
Good.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.631
I'm gonna take a shower
and then go into work,

31:40.633 --> 31:43.934
At which point I will resume
being a professional.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.270
(footsteps depart)

31:49.974 --> 31:51.608
(buttons click)

31:53.244 --> 31:55.078
Josie's little break-in?
It was faked.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.682
Her sister. Or daughter.
Or sister/daughter. Whatever.

31:58.684 --> 31:59.616
Candace!

31:59.618 --> 32:02.519
Candace could've had
one of her campaign workers

32:02.521 --> 32:04.288
Drop it off
at reston's headquarters.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.656
You know what
those places are like--

32:05.658 --> 32:07.224
People are coming
and going all day.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.259
M-m-maybe it was somebody else
from the staff.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.994
Harrison, who discovered
the break-in?

32:10.996 --> 32:12.596
Who jumped the gun
with the press?

32:12.598 --> 32:14.398
Who's been driving this
whole thing from the get-go?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.632
Okay, okay. What do you
want me to do about it?

32:15.634 --> 32:16.667
Talk to the sister.

32:16.669 --> 32:19.670
Yeah. Fine.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.138
(cell phone beeps)

32:21.140 --> 32:22.606
Who was that?

32:24.609 --> 32:26.243
Work.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.411
<i>(fitz) I couldn't be happier</i>
<i>to be back</i>

32:27.413 --> 32:32.849
<i>So that's what the goal</i>
<i>of this trip is--</i>

32:32.851 --> 32:34.584
<i>To hear it straight</i>
<i>from the horse's mouth.</i>

32:34.586 --> 32:35.719
<i>If you'll excuse me,</i>
<i>I've got a stack of pancakes</i>

32:35.721 --> 32:37.254
<i>Waiting for me inside.</i>

32:37.256 --> 32:38.956
(door opens)
(cyrus) that's our boy!

32:38.958 --> 32:41.224
(door closes)
what did I tell ya?
A few days on the road,

32:41.226 --> 32:42.726
Shaking hands
and kissing babies,

32:42.728 --> 32:44.728
And he's acting like
a president again.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.998
If that's why you're here.
Other than arranging for him

32:48.000 --> 32:49.533
To bump into james
in a locker room,

32:49.535 --> 32:50.667
I don't know what else
I can do.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.269
Yeah, I thought of
the locker room, too.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.403
Cyrus!

32:53.405 --> 32:55.138
It's happening tonight
is why I'm here.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.742
Sally's still out of town.
So james is going over

32:58.744 --> 33:00.544
To the naval observatory
for dinner.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.679
There'll be wine, candles,
a guy named lionel

33:02.681 --> 33:04.581
Hiding in a tree
with a telephoto lens.

33:04.583 --> 33:05.716
Are you sure you want
to do this?

33:05.718 --> 33:07.451
This is a marriage
we're talking about.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.987
Sally must suspect
her husband's a big gay slut.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.189
We're just making sure
she knows we know.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.191
Not sally's marriage.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.094
You're worried about james
cheating on <i>me?</i>

33:17.096 --> 33:18.729
That's...
(sighs)

33:18.731 --> 33:23.233
You cannot close it again.
It changes you.

33:23.235 --> 33:29.406
My husband's...
Not your husband, mellie.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.613
I tried to call you last night.
Everything okay?

33:36.615 --> 33:40.183
Yeah, I was just busy.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.020
I told you he'd find a way,
didn't I?

33:45.656 --> 33:46.723
(abby) I thought you said
this would work.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.091
(huck) I thought it would.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.426
What's not working?

33:49.428 --> 33:50.560
We still can't identify

33:50.562 --> 33:54.431
Facial recognition
software?
Nothing.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.066
What happens if
we let the program run longer?

33:56.068 --> 33:58.068
No point. This is the highest
resolution I could get.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.770
Our base image was too flawed.

33:59.772 --> 34:03.373
So we're back to square one.
Liv...

34:03.375 --> 34:06.410
They're here.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.511
This is the game, josie.
This is how it--

34:07.513 --> 34:08.745
This isn't a game!

34:08.747 --> 34:09.813
This is watergate!

34:09.815 --> 34:12.082
Josie.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.617
How is what I did
any different

34:13.619 --> 34:15.519
Than what these people--
the people you wanted to hire--

34:15.521 --> 34:17.187
Do on an hourly basis?

34:17.189 --> 34:18.755
You... Got... Caught.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.691
Can I have a moment
with the congresswoman, please?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.894
(footsteps depart,
door opens)

34:27.231 --> 34:28.465
(door closes)

34:28.467 --> 34:31.435
It's just...
We were gaining ground...

34:31.437 --> 34:33.470
With endorsements
and support at rallies.

34:33.472 --> 34:37.240
If we handle this right,
it's a bump in the road.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.842
And how you handle it
will help show

34:38.844 --> 34:41.478
Your leadership abilities
and define your character.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.513
But you're going to have
to fire candace.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.648
Make an example of her.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.816
Define my character
by firing candace?

34:45.818 --> 34:47.551
It's called
making a tough choice.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.852
A painful one.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.353
The right one.

34:50.355 --> 34:52.556
The voters will respect you

34:52.558 --> 34:54.157
For standing up
and doing the thing

34:54.159 --> 34:55.625
That no one wants
to ever have to do.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.693
And it's just
a matter of time

34:56.695 --> 34:58.562
Before
the u.S. Attorney's office

34:58.564 --> 35:00.664
Ties the burglary to candace.
Do it now!

35:00.666 --> 35:02.866
Come clean, and I can help you
move past this.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.434
If we wait for
the justice department

35:04.436 --> 35:06.136
To force your hand--
okay, understood.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.241
I'll prepare
a press conference,

35:11.243 --> 35:12.609
Help you work up
a statement.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.812
Figuring out what to tell
the press, I can handle.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.748
What I tell candace
is another story.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.585
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

35:21.587 --> 35:23.787
This is where I spend
most of my time--

35:23.789 --> 35:25.388
My man cave, if you will.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.724
Sally decorated it
as a birthday present

35:27.726 --> 35:31.761
She claims it was to keep me
from being homesick.

35:31.763 --> 35:35.265
But mostly it was
to keep me out of her hair.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.300
My college lacrosse stuff.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.302
Apparently,
you were good.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.638
Won the s.E.L.C. Title
two years running.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.739
You keep in touch
with anyone?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.407
Not as much as I'd like.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.443
Back then, we were like
brothers to each other.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.712
All that time on the road,
the team building,

35:48.714 --> 35:51.848
It wasn't until after
I graduated college

35:51.850 --> 35:55.185
I realized how difficult
it is to form bonds

35:55.187 --> 35:56.486
That close out
in the real world.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.488
It's hard.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.257
Don't you agree?

36:00.259 --> 36:02.526
To make new friends
as a grown man.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.662
I-I was a theater major
at middlebury, so...

36:05.664 --> 36:07.831
I imagine it was
a very different experience

36:07.833 --> 36:09.399
Than playing a sport.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.867
Now, you and sally
met in college.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.235
Why don't you tell me
about that?

36:12.237 --> 36:13.570
I could.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.704
(sets down glass)
or we could just
cut to the chase

36:14.706 --> 36:16.339
And have a good time.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.208
(muffled) daniel!

36:18.210 --> 36:19.709
I'm sorry. Wait, stop.
What are you doing?

36:19.711 --> 36:20.777
You're not attracted
to me?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.512
You're married,
and I'm married.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.747
And I thought
you were straight!

36:23.749 --> 36:25.515
I guess I gave you
the wrong impression.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.716
Oh, my god. I-I-I...
Come on now...

36:26.718 --> 36:28.218
I need a minute!

36:28.220 --> 36:30.554
God. (exhales)

36:30.556 --> 36:33.190
Now wait a second!

36:33.192 --> 36:34.524
I...

36:36.861 --> 36:40.363
You can't go saying anything
about this to anybody.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.399
I never would've tried
anything if I hadn't heard

36:42.401 --> 36:43.733
That you were in
an open marriage.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.735
What? From who?!

36:45.737 --> 36:46.970
Mellie!

36:46.972 --> 36:49.272
She said you and cyrus
have some kind of...

36:49.274 --> 36:50.540
An arrangement.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.710
<i>On the vice president's</i>
<i>husband.</i>

36:53.712 --> 36:55.312
<i>They're looking</i>
<i>for a writer.</i>

36:55.314 --> 36:56.780
Next thing I know,

36:56.782 --> 36:58.782
You're suggesting that we do
this interview at the house

36:58.784 --> 37:00.417
On a night when you know
my wife is out of town.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.651
<i>Go to his place.</i>

37:01.653 --> 37:03.253
You come over here
with a bottle.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.588
<i>Bring over a bottle</i>
<i>of nice bourbon.</i>

37:04.590 --> 37:05.722
The hell am I supposed
to think?

37:05.724 --> 37:08.558
<i>He'll open right up.</i>

37:11.797 --> 37:16.866
It pains me to say
that the entire incident

37:16.868 --> 37:18.802
Was a shameful fraud...

37:18.804 --> 37:23.907
Entirely conceived
and executed by myself.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.843
(reporters shouting questions
at once)

37:26.845 --> 37:28.945
I staged the break-in

37:28.947 --> 37:32.282
And had the laptop planted
at reston headquarters.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.384
(under breath) no.
I wanna apologize

37:34.386 --> 37:36.987
To the reston campaign,
governor reston himself,

37:36.989 --> 37:39.522
And the american people
for this unforgivable

37:39.524 --> 37:41.691
Lapse in judgment on my part.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.561
As a result,
I am hereby announcing

37:44.563 --> 37:47.264
The withdrawal of my candidacy

37:47.266 --> 37:50.400
For the democratic
presidential nomination.

37:50.402 --> 37:54.437
My behavior clearly falls
beneath the standard

37:54.439 --> 37:56.339
For those who would aspire

37:56.341 --> 37:58.942
To the highest office
in the land.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.610
Thank you.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.045
And good-bye.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.647
You always said
I wasn't ready

38:03.649 --> 38:05.715
For a national race,
and you were right.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.051
You didn't have to do that.
We had options.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.719
Like throwing my own daughter
under the bus?

38:09.721 --> 38:11.588
What kind of mother
would do that? Would yours?

38:11.590 --> 38:14.557
With everything
I've already put her through

38:14.559 --> 38:15.992
With this campaign...

38:15.994 --> 38:17.360
She's just a kid.

38:17.362 --> 38:19.863
She'd never be able
to handle...

38:19.865 --> 38:21.665
I'll make the plea deal,

38:21.667 --> 38:24.567
Go back to montana,
if they'll still have me.

38:24.569 --> 38:27.637
See if I can maybe
make a difference there. So...

38:27.639 --> 38:29.072
Thanks for everything.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.308
You're welcome,
congresswoman.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.581
Don't, okay?
Just... Don't.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.418
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

38:41.420 --> 38:43.453
(papers rustling)

38:43.455 --> 38:45.055
How was new hampshire?

38:45.057 --> 38:46.890
Good.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.359
Chilly, but good.

38:54.899 --> 38:57.600
Marcus dropped out
of the race.
I heard.

38:57.602 --> 39:00.437
Good for us.
We can beat reston again.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.005
We can.

39:03.908 --> 39:07.811
Means olivia's
available again.

39:07.813 --> 39:11.348
She might be a little more
amenable to the idea now.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.486
Maybe we should try again.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.956
Maybe we should.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.026
(otis redding's "try a little
tenderness" playing)

39:25.029 --> 39:29.566
¶

39:29.568 --> 39:31.067
(door opens)

39:33.471 --> 39:36.039
¶ oh, she may be weary

39:36.041 --> 39:42.112
¶ and young girls,
they do get weary ¶

39:42.114 --> 39:43.780
(door closes)
¶ wearing

39:43.782 --> 39:47.751
¶ that same old shaggy dress

39:47.753 --> 39:50.153
¶ yeah, yeah

39:50.155 --> 39:54.090
(sighs) hey, honey.
Hey.

39:54.092 --> 39:58.461
What?
Your interview.
It's almost midnight.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.929
I expected you back
a lot earlier.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.399
It turns out
you were right--

40:02.401 --> 40:03.933
Little booze...

40:03.935 --> 40:05.602
It opened him right up.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.405
Good. Glad to hear it.

40:08.407 --> 40:09.739
Thanks again.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.541
It feels good
to be back in the saddle.

40:11.543 --> 40:15.412
My pleasure.
You coming to bed?
Yeah.

40:15.414 --> 40:18.448
I'm just gonna...
Jump in the shower first.

40:18.450 --> 40:21.418
Long day. You don't have
to wait up.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.087
Okay.
Okay.

40:24.089 --> 40:27.791
¶ never, never, never possess

40:27.793 --> 40:28.992
Love you.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.494
Love you, too.

40:33.831 --> 40:36.065
(cell phone chimes and buzzes)

40:36.067 --> 40:37.700
(chimes and buzzes)
