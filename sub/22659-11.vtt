Hey.
How are you feeling?

40:00.900 --> 40:05.496
Mm... I've been better.

40:05.796 --> 40:08.860
Did you get it out?

40:08.940 --> 40:11.212
It is a strange fate
that we should suffer

40:11.282 --> 40:15.340
so much fear and doubt
for so small a thing.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.620
Such a little thing.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.940
- Shakespeare?
- Tolkien.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.500
Lord of the Rings Volume One:
Fellowship of the Ring.

40:22.540 --> 40:27.540
- [ Carla ]: Of course.
- This is the future, my friends.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.420
What're you going to do with it?

40:29.500 --> 40:32.460
Technology is actually a
brilliant communications tool.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.660
I was thinking we could donate it to
the London Nuclear Disarmament Centre.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.540
I'm sure they could find something
interesting to do with it.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.620
I leave it in your capable hands.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.780
[ cell phone ringing and vibrating ]

40:42.860 --> 40:45.220
Excuse me.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.340
Hello, Inspector.

40:51.420 --> 40:55.340
Frank, I'm standing outside
the office of Armand Rousseau.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.580
<i>- Do you know who he is?</i>
- I've heard of him, yes.

40:58.660 --> 41:01.580
Uh... perhaps you
know that he is dead?

41:01.660 --> 41:04.260
<i>- Murdered.</i>
- Really? Any suspects?

41:04.300 --> 41:08.150
<i>There are witnesses who say a man</i>
fitting your description

41:08.450 --> 41:12.580
went into Rousseau's office
shortly before his body was discovered.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.940
I have yet to review
the surveillance video.

41:14.980 --> 41:18.020
Have you asked those
witnesses about Carson Bernhardt?

41:18.060 --> 41:22.660
- Carson Bernhardt?
<i>- One of Rousseau's vice presidents.</i>

41:22.700 --> 41:26.980
There are rumours about him possibly
selling company secrets to rivals.

41:27.060 --> 41:31.940
Ah, motive.
I will speak with Mr. Bernhardt.

41:31.980 --> 41:34.260
He drives a Lamborghini.
It's fairly easy to spot.

41:34.340 --> 41:37.140
Especially if it was just sitting
there at the side of the road.

41:37.220 --> 41:40.100
- A road such as...?
<i>- Oh, I don't know.</i>

41:40.140 --> 41:42.820
Probably one less travelled.
Gemenos, maybe.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.553
- Gemenos, yes?
<i>- Find the Lamborghini you'll find him...</i>

41:45.588 --> 41:48.900
and probably blood evidence
linking him to Rousseau's death.

41:48.980 --> 41:52.940
Thank you, Frank.
I will check into this immediately.

41:53.020 --> 41:55.180
Let me know if I can
be any further assistance.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.140
Ah, of course.

41:59.020 --> 42:00.980
[ phone beeps ]

42:11.260 --> 42:14.820
- Feeling OK?
- Fine.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.720
Sure you don't want me to drive?

42:19.100 --> 42:21.540
Never mind.

42:28.037 --> 42:32.359
[ music ]

42:43.539 --> 42:46.039
[ door closing ]

42:46.339 --> 42:48.824
<i>You Dieter?</i>

42:53.287 --> 42:56.580
- Uh, Dieter is not here.
- Is he coming back?

42:56.660 --> 43:00.780
Or did he go to his Ayrton
Senna fan club meeting?

43:01.193 --> 43:06.340
Dieter's got good taste.
Can't wait to talk to him.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.580
So...
[ opens a bottle of beer. ]

43:11.660 --> 43:14.220
...you a Senna fan as well as your boss?

43:16.900 --> 43:21.340
Because I think Senna...
was chickenshit.

43:21.380 --> 43:25.940
- You hear me, Dieter?
- Dieter? Uh, Dieter is not here.

43:25.980 --> 43:29.100
You gonna introduce me?

43:29.180 --> 43:31.780
- Who the fuck are you?
- Dieter. Dieter Haussmann.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.300
- What?
- I apologize for what I said

43:34.340 --> 43:37.180
<i>on the radio. So, uh...</i>

43:37.220 --> 43:43.620
- why don't I buy you a few beers?
- You don't sound like Dieter.

43:43.700 --> 43:46.860
I know. I sound
different on the phone.

43:46.940 --> 43:50.500
<i>- I didn't like what you said.
- So why don't you go and get yourself some beers?</i>

43:50.580 --> 43:53.740
Tell your pal to put down the wrench.

43:53.820 --> 43:55.660
<i>He's making me nervous.</i>

44:05.020 --> 44:10.140
- You're not such a pussy after all, Dieter.
- Thanks.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.580
[ door opening and closing ]

44:18.620 --> 44:21.820
- Got any more of these?
- He got the last one.

44:21.860 --> 44:24.180
- That's a pain in the neck.
- Yeah.

44:24.220 --> 44:28.060
- Come on. I'll buy you dinner.
- I was ready for him, Frank.

44:28.140 --> 44:30.620
I just didn't want anything
to happen to the car.

44:30.700 --> 44:33.180
I know, Dieter. I know...

44:35.885 --> 44:39.490
