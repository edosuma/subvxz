WEBVTT

00:18.351 --> 00:21.354
- Yeah, Ae-bong.
- Give me your brother's phone number.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.356
My brother's? Why?

00:23.481 --> 00:25.150
I just want to know.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.694
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:30.572 --> 00:36.494
I confess...

00:36.619 --> 00:38.329
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you startled me!

00:38.455 --> 00:39.581
Are you writing a letter to confess?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.583
Don't look.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.877
Do you think
I'd write a letter to confess?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.087
I'm just writing this in case I forget.

00:46.212 --> 00:49.090
That's so soon.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.925
You're weird.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.845
Why are you so serious about
what I am writing?

00:53.970 --> 00:55.472
Serious? What do you mean?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.348
- You're so serious now.
- Am I?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.477
Am I serious? Good luck.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.445
High-five!

01:11.112 --> 01:14.407
- Something yummy and expensive.
- All right.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.038
Why does she want
my brother's phone number?

01:25.835 --> 01:29.672
Got it. Here, this is
Seok's brother's phone number.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.218
Really? Are you sure
he wanted to meet me?

01:33.343 --> 01:36.763
Yes, he chose you.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.723
Oh, he chose me.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.101
Um, pass!

01:43.895 --> 01:45.271
Oh, she's great.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.232
She has no boyfriend.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.734
- No kidding.
- I'm not!

01:49.859 --> 01:54.114
I'll ask her and let you know.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.574
If this goes well, you owe me big time.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.868
- All right.
- Yeah!

02:01.871 --> 02:04.499
TIMING

02:04.624 --> 02:06.543
Anything else going on
between you and Seok?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.963
Yes, it was two days ago.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.673
I was wearing a miniskirt.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.969
No kidding! You wore a miniskirt?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.095
Listen, first.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.099
He covered my legs with something.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.435
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yes, yes!

02:24.561 --> 02:27.730
I know why. He didn't want other men
to look at your legs.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.482
He certainly is in love with you.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.443
Really? Do you think so?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.362
- It's not just me, right?
- 100-percent right.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.447
- Anything else?
- Well--

02:37.490 --> 02:38.533
Yes, there is.

02:39.117 --> 02:43.204
I told my co-workers
that your webtoon was very funny.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.247
You owe me one.

02:44.372 --> 02:49.878
I was walking with him,
and suddenly, he hugged me from behind.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.509
Oh, my God! From behind?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.762
- Game over!
- You just need to wait for a confession.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.973
What if he confesses to me?
What am I supposed to say?

03:02.098 --> 03:05.184
What are you worried about?
You're in love with him, no?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.394
What?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.689
You love him.
That's why you wore a miniskirt.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.107
That's right, but--

03:11.232 --> 03:12.567
Stop being so coy.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.068
If he asks you out,

03:14.193 --> 03:16.905
just say yes, and go out with him.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.575
- How lucky you are!
- Yeah, she is.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.911
When will I become lucky?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.495
I really need that luck.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.626
I'm going out.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.793
Where are you going?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.754
How do I look?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.340
I'm seeing someone important.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.301
Jun--

03:42.722 --> 03:45.558
It's me.
Are you seeing my brother today?

03:45.683 --> 03:49.896
No. Yeah, okay.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.066
He wants to see me today.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.236
Oh, you've got a boyfriend, at last!

03:56.361 --> 03:58.446
Have him confess his love.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.909
From my experience,
you have to lead him into saying it.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.746
Then, where did Jun go?

04:08.289 --> 04:14.045
I confess.
Hye-ju Kwon, Hyeon-ji Kim, Ye-seul Kwon--

04:16.381 --> 04:18.925
I've made too many women cry.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.262
Can a bad guy like me be forgiven?

04:22.387 --> 04:24.347
God forgives everyone.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.393
My great charm, no, my look.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.480
No, my existence itself ruins them.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.857
May the grace of God be with you.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.904
Hello.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.662
It's a sin to tell God a lie, brother.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.248
You're even lying in this place
where you confess your sins.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.251
I didn't lie.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.629
Do you think Adam and Eve were punished
because they ate the apple?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.007
They lied! That's why!

05:01.092 --> 05:02.844
What is he angry about?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.270
We opened up a new restaurant.
Thanks.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.731
RESTAURANT FLING
ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE

05:20.111 --> 05:21.821
- Ae-bong!
- Oh, hi.

05:21.946 --> 05:22.780
You're early.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.533
He's going to confess.
He must have a ring.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.661
That's right.
Have him confess his love.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.039
You have to lead him into saying it.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.540
Do you want to go here?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.292
They have real nice food.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.835
I've always wanted to go here.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.880
- Yeah, but I--
- Let's go.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.465
Let's go, hurry.

05:42.008 --> 05:46.304
Wow, congratulations! Be happy!

05:54.645 --> 05:57.482
What now?
You have no choice but to confess.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.776
Do it now, Seok.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.742
Hey, this is embarrassing.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.911
Okay, then. Let's--

06:12.747 --> 06:13.956
What?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.836
Look at these leaves!
There are so many of them, huh?

06:18.961 --> 06:19.837
Yeah.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.840
I have to make a call.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.928
Shit.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.235
Oh, the ring is gone.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.368
- Oh, this is classic!
- This is dessert.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.333
Hey!

06:58.876 --> 07:00.044
- Well--
- Yeah.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.839
I don't want to swallow it.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.340
Where is it?

07:04.465 --> 07:07.510
- What?
- I know everything.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.053
You can tell me.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.346
Where is it?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.765
Our address is 21 Sinsa-dong.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.397
You really don't want to tell me.
What a lame joke!

07:22.900 --> 07:24.735
Let's see.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.321
Why aren't you eating the cake?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.157
- This is--
- You're full, huh?

07:30.908 --> 07:31.868
Oh, no!

07:34.579 --> 07:35.455
Do you want half?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.540
I didn't touch this part.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.419
You can have it.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.135
Thanks for watching it with me.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.845
I really wanted to see this.

07:50.970 --> 07:55.725
Don't mention it.
Thanks to you, I get to watch a play.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.479
If you can't confess here,
you're not a man.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.441
CONFESS YOUR LOVE
PROPOSAL EVENT AFTER PLAY

08:03.566 --> 08:05.651
LOVE IS BLOOMING

08:10.198 --> 08:11.073
It's not the end yet.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.286
You must've been looking forward to this.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.413
Now, the highlight of our performance,

08:17.538 --> 08:18.998
confession time begins.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.295
If you've been hesitant to say it,

08:24.420 --> 08:28.424
raise your hand
and come up on the stage.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.676
- Agh!
- Oh, there you are!

08:30.801 --> 08:34.263
- You, gentleman in the yellow T-shirt.
- What?

08:34.388 --> 08:35.681
Come on up.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.816
Confess like a man.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.361
Confess what?

08:49.153 --> 08:52.823
Just say it. We know everything.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.117
Oh--

08:57.203 --> 09:01.499
I've arranged everything for you.
If you can't say it, you're a moron.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.292
Yeah, right.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.213
I'm Seok Cho, the artist who drew
"The Sound of Your Heart."

09:08.756 --> 09:11.300
You must've recognized me and--

09:11.425 --> 09:14.762
- Moron!
- What's  "The Sound of Your Heart"?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.514
- I don't know.
- Say "Ho"!

09:18.599 --> 09:20.643
I say "The Sound of,"
you say "Your Heart."

09:20.768 --> 09:22.853
The Sound of--
The Sound of--

09:22.979 --> 09:24.772
I say Cho, and you say Seok!

09:24.897 --> 09:27.066
- Cho!
- He's weird!

09:35.992 --> 09:39.328
If you're the most pathetic moron,
you'll confess when you get drunk.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.040
- Well--
- Do you like to drink?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.250
Have a drink, cheers!

09:48.004 --> 09:49.088
Cheers!

09:52.675 --> 09:53.968
We're going to get really drunk!

09:54.093 --> 09:56.971
That's what drinks are for.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.598
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

10:05.271 --> 10:11.694
Listen, I was really happy
when I met you again.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.113
Were you happy, too?

10:14.238 --> 10:16.532
Right? Right?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.326
- Ae-bong!
- Yeah.

10:18.451 --> 10:23.289
Actually, I have something to tell you.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.124
Tell me.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.461
I'll listen to you. I'm all ears.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.802
Someone loves you.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.226
My brother.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.648
Why? Why does your brother love me?

10:49.690 --> 10:53.611
Because... you're ugly.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.785
Bastard!

11:15.466 --> 11:16.884
Why are you here?

11:17.843 --> 11:21.138
I'm sorry, I blacked out last night.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.432
Did I make any mistakes?

11:23.557 --> 11:26.602
No, you didn't.
You just told the truth, you moron.

11:26.727 --> 11:30.106
Good luck with your business trip.
I'll see you when you return.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.317
No, I don't want to see you anymore.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.654
Let's not see each other again.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.492
Ae-bong.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.622
I was wrong and put on a stupid show.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.165
I'm done.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.602
Attention, please.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.611
The plane has arrived at Gate 12.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.699
The plane has arrived at Gate 12.

12:36.797 --> 12:37.923
Ae-bong!

12:40.968 --> 12:42.761
Goodbye, Seok.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.390
I don't want anything from you.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.559
Ae-bong!

12:50.436 --> 12:52.104
Ae-bong, Ae-bong!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.111
Ae-bong!

12:59.570 --> 13:00.529
Ae-bong!

13:00.863 --> 13:02.531
- You can't get in without your passport!
- Wait a second!

13:02.656 --> 13:03.532
Ae-bong!

13:03.657 --> 13:05.576
Ae--

13:06.327 --> 13:09.747
Here, Ae-bong!

13:15.211 --> 13:17.463
Ae-bong, listen to me!

13:19.590 --> 13:22.551
I must've left my wallet in the taxi.
I have no money with me!

13:23.385 --> 13:27.056
I have no money for the bus!

13:27.181 --> 13:32.061
Give me three dollars!
Ae-bong, Give me three dollars!

13:32.186 --> 13:33.729
I need three dollars for the bus!

13:51.705 --> 13:52.623
Okay.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.754
Thanks.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.090
I'll go out with you.

14:03.717 --> 14:04.802
What?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.930
Let's go out.

14:10.641 --> 14:15.604
Yeah, let's go out.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.567
We are...

14:28.117 --> 14:32.246
DAY 1

14:36.584 --> 14:38.794
- I'm going out.
- Where are you going?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.087
I'm seeing someone important.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.381
- Are you seeing my brother today?
- No.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.632
Then let's meet today.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.509
My brother may call you.
Don't answer his call.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.261
Okay, sure.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.848
I'm doing it today.
It has to be today.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.311
I'll bring her here in five minutes.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.564
- Good luck!
- Thanks!

14:59.815 --> 15:02.151
- Ae-bong!
- Do you want to go here?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.862
- Yeah, but I--
- I've always wanted go here.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.823
They have real nice food.
Let's go, hurry.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.495
I'm sorry.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.832
He went somewhere else.
Let's go back.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.461
Pack this, clean that up.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.299
Changing location to a theater.
We'll be the first to leave.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.383
CHANGING LOCATION TO A THEATER.
WE'LL BE THE FIRST TO LEAVE.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.260
They'll be the first people to come out.
Wait.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.598
It's not the end yet.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.184
Oh, they're coming.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.729
Confess your love!

15:42.358 --> 15:44.193
I'm Seok Cho, the artist who drew
"The Sound of Your Heart."

15:44.652 --> 15:46.111
You must've recognized me and--

15:46.236 --> 15:47.112
There.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.201
You're ugly.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.830
Idiot! What's he doing?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
Hey, they're leaving!

16:02.544 --> 16:03.879
I LOVE YOU. BE MINE.

Don't worry! Anyone can do it.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.766
If you can't, you're a pathetic moron.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.144
But it's my first date ever.

17:36.930 --> 17:41.018
Take a walk and hold her hand naturally.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.978
Hold her hand?

18:17.679 --> 18:22.476
Hmm, first date. Isn't it simple?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.729

18:25.854 --> 18:27.106
you walk and hold hands.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.526

19:13.193 --> 19:16.155
Don't worry. We'll ask everyone
who knows all about romance.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.865
