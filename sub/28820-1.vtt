WEBVTT

01:40.400 --> 01:42.880
It's an honor to finally meet you.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.800
You're a great warrior.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.440
There's no one else in this region
that I'd ever say that to.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.200
Do you really think you'll win?

03:23.600 --> 03:24.640
This one's for you.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.560
Having a string of losses
on your recent record,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.640
now you're going up against
a undefeated boxer.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.920
What are your thoughts on that?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.720
Masahiro is a great warrior.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.720
And everyone expects him to win.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.200
But I guess we'll just
have to wait and see.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.960
Hey... how are you feeling, man?

07:02.080 --> 07:03.240
Oh, I don't know.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.800
I'm in my head, I guess.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.920
This guy... is gonna smash Masahiro.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.240
Clint knows that.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.920
- You know that, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, Silas.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.440
Hey, listen... there's a few things
we need to talk about.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.600
Here they come.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.720
Glad you gentlemen
could make it back here to see us.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.280
We are very grateful
for this opportunity.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.320
Clint. This is Satoshi-San
and his brother Shichiro-San.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.800
They're the ones that
invited you to fight Masahiro.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.880
They don't look like Federation guys.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.080
Well, things in Japan are done
a little bit differently.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.640
Just bow your head, Clint.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.480
Silas, I hope you understand.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.320
Japan very much anticipates
this Roman spectacle tonight.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.320
Satoshi, the head of
our company, is obliged

10:36.360 --> 10:38.720
to make an offer to your prized fighter.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.440
No need to hide behind
Old World manners, Shichiro-San.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.400
Just tell me what you want.

10:44.680 --> 10:50.040
Satoshi would like to offer to
your fighter seven-fold salary

10:50.080 --> 10:53.880
for tonight's bout in exchange

10:53.920 --> 10:56.840
for the fighter
going down in tonight's fight.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.800
You can tell your brother
that I decline his offer.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.440
Go. Go!

11:27.840 --> 11:29.200
Shichiro-San,

11:29.240 --> 11:31.760
you said it was gonna be
a fair fight back in the States!

11:32.440 --> 11:36.240
You said it was clean.
No bullshit. And that was it.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.720
You call this honor?

12:00.400 --> 12:02.560
You've strayed so very far away from

12:02.600 --> 12:05.920
the path of your people, Mr. Satoshi.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.040
And your lack of faith in Masahiro...

12:11.680 --> 12:13.280
Well, that's disgusting.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.960
For he is a true warrior.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.200
They say he's been reborn from
the ashes of Tokugawa...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.080
Bred in the wilderness...

12:27.680 --> 12:28.800
In the snow...

12:30.520 --> 12:31.840
And in the ice.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.880
Now, I don't know if I can win.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.680
Hell, this may be a fool's errand.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.880
But you let this one thing be heard:

12:47.120 --> 12:50.240
I'm gonna beat Masahiro,
or I'm gonna die trying.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.600
We will resolve this later.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.320
Nice one, Silas.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.440
Who knew that Shichiro had a heart, huh?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.880
Did you know that they
were gonna pull this?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.440
They said it was gonna be a clean fight.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.080
So, these guys march in here
like your best fucking pals,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.400
and you're gonna stand there and tell me

14:18.440 --> 14:20.480
that you don't know a goddam thing?

14:20.520 --> 14:23.960
These guys have
their hands in everything.

14:24.760 --> 14:30.200
Casinos, sports, companies, stocks,

14:30.240 --> 14:32.840
and most of all, fucking boxing.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.160
I believe it was you that asked me to

14:36.200 --> 14:38.840
get you this fight, because you
were having a hard time and...

14:38.880 --> 14:41.200
Well, of course everything
revolves around you,

14:41.240 --> 14:42.720
because you're a selfish prick.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.080
Well, what have you done?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.640
I make the connections
to book you the fights.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
I get you into any place
that you want to go

14:52.440 --> 14:54.000
and make sure that you're comfortable,

14:54.040 --> 14:55.640
in your little hotel room.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.640
Now, I gotta go smooth these guys over.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.800
Because they could come back and
cause a lot of problems for us.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.520
Japanese fighters seem
keen on surprise attacks.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.880
So, I'm just hoping for a fair fight.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.800
This a bad time?

28:25.280 --> 28:26.280
What do you need?

28:27.280 --> 28:29.640
I need a word with Shichiro and Satoshi.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.440
Shichiro-San, Satoshi-San.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.480
I apologize on behalf of Clint.
It wasn't right.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.720
He's a prizefighter. What do you expect?
He wants to win.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.480
I mean, these guys,
you could crack an egg on their head.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.200
Silas, my brother believes
this is bigger than one fighter.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.640
He has a grand strategy here.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.880
You cannot back out now.

29:30.360 --> 29:34.080
Clint will honor the agreement.
I know what's at stake.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.320
So... it's under control?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.200
Yes. It's under control.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.160
But you let a couple a years slip by,

30:09.200 --> 30:10.520
living a life you shouldn't have.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.160
Part of it is my fault.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.200
Couldn't get to you the way I should've.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.640
Maybe it's all my fault.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.640
But we're here now.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.840
Man, if I could barely
get by the way you did

30:35.880 --> 30:39.200
past couple years, I'd die a happy man.

31:16.520 --> 31:17.480
Yeah.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.040
- You OK?
- Yeah.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.680
You sure?

32:14.120 --> 32:15.080
I'm fine.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.600
You gotta think about the wife
and the kid coming.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.360
I really tried... to put
the work in on this fight.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.960
Some people, they want to rob you
of your skill and your hard work.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.600
To them, they just see it
as talent and luck.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.720
But special don't mean nothing
without hard work.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.680
I can win this. Right?

32:49.720 --> 32:50.680
Look...

32:53.280 --> 32:54.800
If you want something real,

32:57.200 --> 33:01.560
you gotta make it of stone and metal.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.560
You gotta make it strong.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.320
You gotta build it up day by day.

33:07.560 --> 33:11.360
And in the end, you've something
very fucking real!

35:37.320 --> 35:39.280
<i>You were dragged into the wilderness</i>

35:39.320 --> 35:41.240
<i>of your life to find me.</i>

35:45.520 --> 35:48.080
<i>I came to you as a father to guide you.</i>

35:51.400 --> 35:53.760
<i>Where? You are a child...</i>

35:55.320 --> 35:57.920
<i>Wandering but never lost.</i>

35:58.880 --> 36:02.400
<i>And if you find him,
he will breath calmness</i>

36:02.440 --> 36:06.120
<i>into your son.
And his life will be fruitful.</i>

36:07.680 --> 36:12.360
<i>For what is God to man
but a father to a son?</i>

36:12.960 --> 36:14.240
<i>Turn around.</i>

36:36.880 --> 36:40.640
<i>An old woman said something
about these trees.</i>

36:42.560 --> 36:44.000
<i>Cherry blossoms...</i>

36:47.160 --> 36:49.560
<i>They're known for their very short</i>

36:50.400 --> 36:52.480
<i>and brilliant blooming season.</i>

36:54.760 --> 36:56.720
She told me it's a reminder that

36:56.800 --> 36:59.640
life is so tragically short...

37:01.880 --> 37:03.080
But beautiful.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.560
Did you finally talk to him?

37:28.320 --> 37:29.640
He's always listening.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.400
But does he answer?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.640
In his own way, he does.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.480
He's not real, my love.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.960
Put faith in yourself.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.560
You can't keep waiting for a miracle.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.800
Look at where we are.

38:09.280 --> 38:14.560
You dragged us all the way here
for one more chance at glory.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.080
I'm not talking about this again.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.520
He's been watching over us,
Genevieve. I know he has.

38:29.520 --> 38:34.040
You need to focus,
on your skill and perseverance.

38:35.640 --> 38:39.000
You need to know how you're
going to finally win this one.

38:39.440 --> 38:44.040
When I win... when I win, Genevieve,

38:44.120 --> 38:47.320
we go back home and we're back on top.

38:48.240 --> 38:52.160
And everything will be fine.
Just the way it was.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.000
And what if you don't?

38:57.120 --> 39:01.360
What about our family?
What about our son?

39:03.920 --> 39:10.440
I came here to beat Masahiro. And
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.720
I don't believe you.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.240
I thought you had faith in me.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.360
I see the fear in your eyes.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.720
Looking good.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.280
How is it, every time
I make a little headway,

50:02.320 --> 50:05.320
you mosey on in with
your smug, fucking face?

50:08.320 --> 50:09.280
I need a moment.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.080
Get outta here, Silas.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.720
I need you to listen to me, Clinton.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.200
We got work to do, Silas.

50:20.160 --> 50:23.240
- I need a moment.
- Get the hell outta here.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.960
Clint. I need you to listen!

50:30.000 --> 50:32.080
Get the hell outta here, you!

50:33.200 --> 50:34.720
What the fuck do you know?!

50:34.800 --> 50:35.720
Fuck you!

50:38.680 --> 50:39.840
Fucking go!

50:40.640 --> 50:41.600
...fuck go.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.680
Enough.

50:43.000 --> 50:43.960
Take a walk.

50:45.720 --> 50:46.720
You too, Jules.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.920
All right, Jules.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.200
They won't let you win.

51:21.360 --> 51:22.680
Well, it's not up to them.

51:23.800 --> 51:27.720
You have no idea how much
of this is their creation.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.880
They brought us here.
This is their domain.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.960
And while we are here, Satoshi is God.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.000
So, why'd you set this up then?

51:45.120 --> 51:47.600
I didn't know what they
wanted until they came in.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.080
I told you that.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.520
You're fighting the Japanese champion,

51:55.560 --> 51:58.640
and the way I see it,
you have no other outs.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.840
No, I'd love to lose.
If he can beat me.

52:07.960 --> 52:13.200
And if I lose tonight, it'll be
at the hands of an honorable man.

52:13.240 --> 52:14.480
A warrior.

52:15.840 --> 52:19.240
You see, Silas,
it's not all about winning.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.920
At least not to me it isn't.

52:24.160 --> 52:28.040
It's about the fight.
That's what matters.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.680
Your preachy bullshit,

52:32.760 --> 52:33.920
it's real sweet and all...

52:36.000 --> 52:38.080
But there is a pathway for everything.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.800
You hit a rough spot, and you
asked me to smooth it out.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.480
We'll get you paid,

52:44.520 --> 52:46.560
and then we'll have an honest
one back in the States.

52:46.600 --> 52:50.400
But you will have to
fall before you can walk.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.440
It's "crawl" before you walk.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.840
The point is, I've never
not looked out for you.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.960
And this time's no different.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.720
I mean, what if you lose?

53:04.680 --> 53:06.760
With no payout from these guys?
Then what?

53:07.240 --> 53:08.600
Then I lose.

53:12.840 --> 53:13.800
You're not...

53:17.000 --> 53:18.920
You're not listening to me.

53:22.280 --> 53:25.640
You reject this offer,
and they will kill you.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.640
They will kill m...

53:30.640 --> 53:33.920
You go out there, and you
fight for guts and glory,

53:33.960 --> 53:36.200
and you win, and they will
kill you anyways.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.440
You reject this offer,

53:39.960 --> 53:41.800
and you lose on your own steam...

53:43.120 --> 53:44.440
And then we're done back in the States.

53:44.480 --> 53:46.360
We are fucked either way you like it.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.800
So just take the goddamn money, Clint.

53:48.840 --> 53:51.160
So, I dragged my pregnant wife,

53:52.320 --> 53:55.560
halfway around the world, for what?

53:56.800 --> 53:59.080
So she can watch me fall to the floor?

54:00.120 --> 54:02.280
And be defeated by my own hands?

54:02.320 --> 54:04.360
They're gonna fucking kill both of us!

54:09.120 --> 54:10.240
What else do I have to say?

54:27.680 --> 54:28.640
OK...

54:34.880 --> 54:36.440
Well, look at it from this angle...

54:36.520 --> 54:37.800
Silas, just go.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.560
- No, no. Hear me out.
- Silas...

54:41.600 --> 54:43.040
I said, hear me out, Clint.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.080
You and Masahiro go head to head.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.280
The cream-of-the-crop fighters
in the entire world.

54:57.480 --> 55:02.280
Amongst political tensions, the
two men aim to fight for country.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.840
Round One... and they come out swinging!

55:09.200 --> 55:12.840
And it is a beautiful sight to see.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.640
The mythic creatures
deliver blow after blow.

55:17.680 --> 55:21.560
I mean, the audience is in awe
of their strength.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.600
Round Two, Round Three, Round Four...

55:26.680 --> 55:27.840
And it goes on.

55:28.880 --> 55:31.160
The two men are unrelenting.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.840
And exhausted.

55:36.440 --> 55:40.720
Bloodied. Bruised. It doesn't matter.

55:41.320 --> 55:42.280
Round Five!

55:43.480 --> 55:45.760
The two men exit their corners.

55:46.120 --> 55:51.120
And Clint comes out swinging,
knocking Masahiro back.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.640
But his footing remains intact!

55:54.840 --> 55:57.480
And he comes back with
a furious uppercut.

55:58.320 --> 56:02.480
The hit rattles Clint's brain,
leaving him dazed.

56:02.800 --> 56:06.200
Masahiro sees his opportunity to end it,

56:06.240 --> 56:08.160
with a jab-cross-hook!

56:08.720 --> 56:11.600
But Clint dodges them all and comes back

56:11.640 --> 56:14.400
with a menacing shot to the body!

56:15.640 --> 56:18.160
But this... leaves him open.

56:19.560 --> 56:22.720
And just then, Masahiro comes in
with the kill shot.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.440
And hits Clint in the jaw. Bam!

56:26.240 --> 56:27.200
Clint goes down.

56:29.560 --> 56:33.360
And the audience, already at
the edge of their seats, rises.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.560
Oh, the anticipation!

56:37.120 --> 56:40.960
Clint musters every last
bit of strength that

56:41.000 --> 56:44.400
he has to rise up and finish it.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.160
But he cannot.

56:46.600 --> 56:51.720
Seven! Eight! Nine!
Ten, he's out.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.080
Masahiro is victorious.

56:57.520 --> 57:01.080
The fighter... comes to the aid
of his opponent.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.280
He helps him up.

57:02.600 --> 57:06.120
Then they raise their hands in victory.

57:07.200 --> 57:11.960
And indeed the entire arena
is going mad!

57:12.880 --> 57:17.120
Japan cheers them on.
The whole world cheers them on!

57:17.720 --> 57:22.240
They have the world... on its knees.

57:31.760 --> 57:33.840
Does this sound like
the story of a loser?

57:36.520 --> 57:41.440
This is the story of
two fighters from opposing worlds

57:41.880 --> 57:45.080
that brought it all together. Tonight!

57:47.400 --> 57:51.240
You're not losing, you're
driving the narrative!

57:53.040 --> 57:58.800
Making seven-fold. And that,
my friend, is not a loss.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.640
Well, that was a beautiful story, Silas.

58:11.600 --> 58:13.200
Now, get the fuck out.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.640
Don't disappoint everyone.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.200
Masahiro, Masahiro, Masahiro, Masahiro!

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.160
- No Tokugawa?
- Doesn't look like it.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.080
Just keep your distance and
clock him. You got it?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.359
Don't stand on the edge and
try to pick him off no more.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:35.040
You gotta reverse the pressure,
move in closer. Got it?

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.399
Good. Go.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.160
Genevieve...

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.360
What are you doing, that's my son!

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.960
What are you doing?!

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.640
What are you doing?! Genevieve!

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.240
Sorry.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.200
My wife and kid left me too.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.920
I didn't see you there.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.840
Come on, Clint! Look where you are.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.640
You're on top of the world!

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.680
Your past opponents.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.440
The ones who didn't make it.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.320
Fell straight down to ground zero.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.080
No one's as good as
The Great Clint Sullivan.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.400
No, no, no!

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.840
No, no, no!

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.320
Liar!

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.520
No!

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.240
Come to the bottom with us.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.400
You were selfish in your path to glory!

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.600
I have to keep going, no matter what!

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.600
All of our dreams are
resting on your shoulders!

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.640
Make us proud, Clint.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.320
Now we fucking have it!

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.440
He's scared over there. You
see him? He's fucking scared.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.280
Come on, come on.
Breath, breath, breath!

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.640
That's it, that's it, that's it. Yeah.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.360
Knock him out, right? Gonna
knock him out, right?!

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.480
All right, all right.
Take the water. Take the water.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.920
Let's do it guys! Come on.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.240
<i>Do you know the one thing that
I wanted more than anything?</i>

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.080
<i>To be great?</i>

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.200
<i>More than that...</i>

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.080
<i>I just wanted you to see me.</i>

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.320
<i>Clint?</i>

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.600
Down!

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.440
Two!

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.560
Three!

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.120
Four!
