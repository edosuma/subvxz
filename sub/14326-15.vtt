16:26.151 --> 16:27.361
{\an1}TOO EASY.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.171
ALLOW ME.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.679
THANK YOU
CORRECTIVE DENTISTRY.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.938
THEY GAVE ME A QUARTER.

17:03.021 --> 17:03.605
AM I IN TROUBLE?

17:03.689 --> 17:06.275
IS THIS TUNA?

17:06.358 --> 17:06.775
YES.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.862
THEN YOU'RE FINE.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.204
SHE'S EATING THE TUNA.
30 SECONDS.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.341
Chester:
1O SECONDS.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.968
HURRY.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.721
THE SYSTEM IS COMING
TO STOMP DOWN

17:35.804 --> 17:37.139
{\an5}ON THE PEOPLE'S
RIGHT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH!

17:37.222 --> 17:38.390
GOT IT!

17:48.692 --> 17:51.653
OH, MY GOODNESS!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.489
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
I--HMM?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.908
YAY! COOKIE!

17:59.036 --> 18:02.498
{\an1}WOW! TIMMY'S
PERMANENT RECORD!

18:02.581 --> 18:04.333
{\an1}WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND OF
DARK SECRETS

18:04.416 --> 18:07.169
AND HIDDEN AGENDAS
WE'LL FIND IN HERE.

18:07.252 --> 18:07.544
LET'S DO THIS.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.963
[SLURP!]

18:12.382 --> 18:14.760
LOW GRADES,
HEALTH REPORT.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.846
LOOK AT ALL THE CHEESE
HE ATE IN FOURTH GRADE.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.016
{\an5}NO WONDER HE WAS
CONSTIPATED THAT
ENTIRE YEAR.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.685
{\an4}AND HERE'S A PHOTO
FROM HIS LAST
PARENT/TEACHERS CONFERENCE.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.646
HOLY FOOD STAMPS!

18:25.729 --> 18:28.524
THOSE AREN'T
TIMMY'S PARENTS.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.525
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.359
THAT GUY WITH GREEN HAIR

18:30.442 --> 18:32.361
LOOKS WAY SMARTER
THAN TIMMY'S DAD.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.405
HERE THEY ARE IN
THE THREE-LEGGED RACE.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.573
PICKING HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL.

18:36.657 --> 18:40.202
{\an5}AND HERE THEY ARE
BACKSTAGE WITH
SIEGFRIED AND ROY!

18:40.285 --> 18:43.038
NO WAY! THOSE TICKETS
ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.706
I KNOW. I'VE TRIED.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.417
{\an1}THERE'S ONLY ONE
LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

18:47.501 --> 18:47.876
{\an1}COME ON.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.753
TIMMY TURNER?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.588
WE KNOW YOUR SECRET.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.923
WHAT?

18:53.006 --> 18:55.884
WE KNOW YOU GOT RID
OF YOUR REAL PARENTS

18:55.968 --> 18:57.219
{\an1}AND USED THE INSURANCE
TO BUY THE INTERNET

18:57.302 --> 19:00.931
{\an1}AND THESE PINK AND GREEN
REPLACEMENT PARENTS.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.517
WE'RE ONTO YOU.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.396
UM--I STILL CAN'T SEE,

19:07.479 --> 19:09.731
{\an1}BUT THOSE TWO KIDS
SOUND REALLY UNPOPULAR.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.776
GUYS, I'M FINALLY
AT THE POPULAR TABLE.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.236
CAN WE DO THIS LATER?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.572
{\an5}HA HA OH!
YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.866
IS THAT ALL PART
OF YOUR SCHEME?

19:18.949 --> 19:20.784
ARE YOU GONNA GET
RID OF US, TOO? HMM?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.163
ACTUALLY,
THAT WOULD BE MY JOB.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.504
WE WILL NOT
BE SILENCED!

19:38.093 --> 19:39.344
DO YOU
HEAR ANYTHING?

19:39.428 --> 19:40.387
SHH. HE'S TALKING.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.392
{\an4}HEY, ABOUT TODAY.
IT SEEMS LIKE
I GOT ON YOUR NERVES.

19:45.475 --> 19:49.062
{\an5}YEAH, I'D GET
ON MY PARENTS
NERVES, TOO,

19:49.146 --> 19:53.066
{\an5}IF HAD THEM BOUND,
GAGGED, AND STUFFED
IN A BOWLING BALL BAG!

19:53.150 --> 19:55.611
{\an4}QUIET. GET UP THERE
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.489
{\an5}CHESTER McBADBAT,
ACE PHOTOGRAPHER
ON THE CASE.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.079
I'M PART SQUIRREL.

20:06.163 --> 20:11.084
GO. THERE ARE
LIVES AT STAKE.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.921
{\an4}SO, I MADE YOU A LIST
OF THINGS I'LL NEED
FOR MY PARTY

20:14.004 --> 20:16.048
TONIGHT AT
MY MANSION!

20:16.131 --> 20:18.175
{\an5}THAT FIEND!
HE'S USING HIS PARENTS'
INSURANCE MONEY

20:18.258 --> 20:22.054
TO FUND SOME SORT OF
FANCY MANSION PARTY.

20:22.137 --> 20:22.346
[POOF!]

20:24.765 --> 20:27.476
OH, MY GOSH.
I--WHOA!

20:27.559 --> 20:28.602
EEK!

20:29.728 --> 20:30.479
{\an1}DID YOU GET
THE SHOT?

20:30.562 --> 20:32.981
CHESTER McBADBAT,
ACE PHOTOGRAPHER,

20:33.065 --> 20:35.317
ALWAYS GETS
HIS SHOT.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.986
{\an4}COME ON.
LET'S GO RUN THIS
BY MR.BIRKENBAKE.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.823
CHESTER McBADBAT,
ACE PHOTOGRAPHER,

20:41.907 --> 20:43.075
IS NOT PART
FLYING SQUIRREL.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.955
CHESTER, A.J.?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.373
{\an5}DO YOU, LIKE,
HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TIME IT IS?

20:49.456 --> 20:54.002
INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM
HAS NO CURFEW, MAN!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.212
AND I DON'T
HAVE A WATCH.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.339
{\an4}WE'RE SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,
MR. BIRKENBAKE,

20:57.422 --> 20:58.799
BUT WE HAVE OUR STORY.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.969
YEAH. TIMMY TURNER
GOT RID OF HIS PARENTS

21:02.052 --> 21:04.221
{\an5}AND HE'S USING
THE INSURANCE MONEY
TO BECOME MORE POPULAR!

21:04.304 --> 21:05.055
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PROOF?

21:05.138 --> 21:06.682
DID YOU, LIKE,
TALK TO TIMMY?

21:06.765 --> 21:09.643
UH--

21:09.726 --> 21:14.064
{\an5}BOYS, IF YOU'RE
GONNA DESTROY
SOMEBODY'S REPUTATION,

21:14.147 --> 21:16.608
{\an5}YOU HAVE TO BE FAIR
AND GET THEIR SIDE
OF THE STORY, TOO.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.694
AND YOU HAVE TO
DO IT BY TOMORROW,

21:18.777 --> 21:20.070
OR YOU'RE OFF
THE PAPER.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.196
FAIRNESS?

21:21.279 --> 21:24.116
{\an1}THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY
THE MAN IS KEEPING US DOWN!

21:24.199 --> 21:26.451
AMEN, BROTHER.
AMEN.

21:29.329 --> 21:33.000
{\an5}OK, WE GET
ONE STATEMENT
FROM TIMMY...

21:33.083 --> 21:35.669
{\an1}AND THEN TOMORROW,
WE EXPOSE HIM

21:35.752 --> 21:38.005
{\an4}AS THE VICIOUS,
PINK-HATTED SCOUNDREL
HE IS.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.173
I WANT FRIENDS WHO
LIKE ME FOR WHO I AM,

21:40.257 --> 21:43.593
NOT FOR THE STUFF
I HAVE.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.846
{\an5}I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
FIGURE THAT OUT
EARLIER.

21:45.929 --> 21:49.433
{\an5}WOW. HE JUST DUMPED
HIS POPULARITY
TO BE FRIENDS WITH US.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.893
{\an4}BIG DEAL.
HE'S STILL
A LESS POPULAR

21:51.977 --> 21:54.062
{\an1}PARENT GETTER RID-OF-ER...
VER.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.564
TIMMY.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.732
WE'RE BACK.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.235
{\an5}AND THERE'S OUR SON
WHO NEVER BOUNDS
AND/OR GAGS US.

22:00.318 --> 22:03.947
OR STUFFS US INTO
BOWLING BALL BAGS.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.074
HE'S SO GOOD TO US.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.827
COOL. HIS PARENTS
ARE STILL ALIVE.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.078
{\an1}OH, GREAT.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.122
{\an1}EXCEPT NOW
MR. BIRKENBAKE'S

22:12.205 --> 22:13.915
{\an1}GONNA KICK US OFF
THE PAPER FOR SURE.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.630
{\an1}SO, YOU BOYS
DON'T HAVE A STORY.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.799
NO, MR. BIRKENBAKE.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.594
{\an4}TIMMY'S A GOOD FRIEND
AND DIDN'T GET RID
OF HIS PARENTS.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.430
WE DIDN'T WANT TO TRASH
HIS REPUTATION UNFAIRLY.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.265
{\an5}OH, YEAH.
WHEN WE TRASH
HIS REPUTATION,

22:30.348 --> 22:32.100
WE WANT TO HAVE
OUR FACTS STRAIGHT.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.270
WHICH IS WHY YOU GET
TO STAY ON THE PAPER.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.229
WHAT?

22:36.313 --> 22:37.939
LITTLE FREEDOM FIGHTERS,

22:38.023 --> 22:40.484
{\an4}YOU JUST LEARNED
THE MOST IMPORTANT
LESSON IN JOURNALISM.

22:40.567 --> 22:44.571
{\an1}IT IS BETTER TO PRINT
A BORING, TRUTHFUL STORY

22:44.654 --> 22:46.281
THAN AN EXCITING LIE.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.825
{\an1}NOW, GO GET ME
A TRUTHFUL STORY.

22:48.909 --> 22:49.868
AWESOME!

22:49.951 --> 22:52.204
UM...AND WE PROMISE
THE NEXT STORY WE BRING YOU

22:52.287 --> 22:55.290
{\an1}WILL BE BOTH EXCITING
AND THE TRUTH.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.295
{\an5}SO, TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW YOU
GAVE US DETENTION

23:00.378 --> 23:02.380
BECAUSE YOU READ THE STORY
WE WROTE ABOUT

23:02.464 --> 23:04.466
{\an1}HOW WE BROKE INTO
THE PERMANENT RECORDS.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.926
THAT'S EXCITING
AND TRUTHFUL.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.011
NO TALKING!

23:08.095 --> 23:10.597
I WILL NOT
BE SILENCED!

23:12.057 --> 23:13.308
WEEEEE!
