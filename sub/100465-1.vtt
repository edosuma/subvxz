04:43.283 --> 04:45.285
But we have a floor

Couldna have my wee grandson

05:02.345 --> 05:04.739
I was thinking of adding a loft.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.285
Oh.

05:29.416 --> 05:33.855
No, I don't suppose
I've done much building,

05:33.985 --> 05:36.292
or farming, for that matter.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.903
Nor do I know
how to drive a horse

05:39.034 --> 05:43.212

or wield a sword, but, uh...

05:45.562 --> 05:49.479
But I'm sure I'll find
a suitable trade
to provide for my family.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.394
And until that time,
ye'll have to rely

05:51.525 --> 05:53.614
on the skills and trades
of others.

Thank you.
Oh, I thought perhaps...

06:05.234 --> 06:08.455
I only expected
copper and brass.

06:08.585 --> 06:11.501
Well...

06:11.632 --> 06:13.547
this one is certainly fit
for my daughter.

06:13.677 --> 06:14.678

06:24.340 --> 06:26.951

06:27.082 --> 06:29.998
a community built
by the people who live there.

06:30.128 --> 06:33.175
Once Jamie and I had chosen
a spot for a new home,

06:33.305 --> 06:35.960
with the help of the settlers,
construction began.

of our new house
had even gone up,

06:40.965 --> 06:44.186
who stood by us
as the seasons came and went,

06:44.316 --> 06:47.102
who looked forward to reaping
the first harvest with us

06:47.232 --> 06:49.452
and to sharing
in our daughter's wedding,

06:49.583 --> 06:52.455

finished the house in time.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.110
We were making our mark
on the land,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.721
laying our foundations
for the rest of our lives.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.338

Yer mind's not here,

37:00.261 --> 37:02.220
Aye.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.835
In another lifetime,
you and I might have

37:11.968 --> 37:15.363
Perhaps if...
I was a different man...

do ye hunt?

39:11.784 --> 39:13.263
Uh, w-whatever I can find.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.835
Uh, bear, beaver, and fox.

39:19.966 --> 39:23.622
Hare, if ye can catch 'im.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.711
You won't get much

Mr. Fraser, sir.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.691
W-we was only talkin' of skin.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.302
Of, uh, skins and pelts, I mean.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.695
Next patient.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.218
Aye, ye've a talent for huntin'.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.916
Couldn't do better myself.

40:01.094 --> 40:04.924
I was hopin'
you'd consider settling here,
on the Ridge.

40:05.054 --> 40:08.188
Though perhaps I'd be unwise
to leave such a charming lad
among the women folk.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.842
I've got more on my mind
than kissin'

40:09.972 --> 40:12.975
and what have ye,
Mr. Fraser, sir.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.890
M-my throat hurts bad.

40:18.851 --> 40:21.593
These look healthy, Mistress.

40:21.723 --> 40:22.723
Ah.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.122
Mr. MacKenzie.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.865
Choosing your breakfast,
Mistress Cameron?

40:32.995 --> 40:37.696
Aye.
'Tis the cock that crows
but the hens that lay the eggs.

40:37.826 --> 40:41.656
A married man ye are now,
come home to roost.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.702
Will ye join me, Mr. MacKenzie?

40:50.056 --> 40:52.058
Did my niece tell ye
that I meant

40:52.188 --> 40:53.842
to make her heiress
to my property?

40:53.973 --> 40:55.844
Aye, she did.

40:55.931 --> 40:59.195
I'm sure, um, my wife
is most conscious of the honor,

40:59.326 --> 41:00.446
Mistress Cameron, but, uh...

41:00.501 --> 41:03.112
Is she?

41:03.199 --> 41:05.288
I shouldn't have thought so,
to hear her talk.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.553
Well, ye ken her mind
better than I do.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.293
Be that is it may,
I mean to tell her

41:10.424 --> 41:11.662
that I have changed my own mind.

41:11.686 --> 41:12.992
Oh.

41:13.122 --> 41:13.949
Well, I'm sure she'll...

41:14.080 --> 41:16.038
I told Gerald Forbes

41:16.125 --> 41:18.127
to draw up a will,
leaving River Run

41:18.258 --> 41:20.956
and all its contents
to Jeremiah.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.743
To... what, to wee Jemmy?

41:24.873 --> 41:26.788
You'll doubtless ken
that a woman's property

41:26.919 --> 41:29.574
becomes her husband's
once she's wed,

41:29.704 --> 41:32.925
and I ken also that protestants
are partial to divorce.

41:35.231 --> 41:38.234
I thought,
if you canna love the lad
for himself,

41:38.365 --> 41:40.976
you might treat him well
for the sake of his prospects.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.283
Are ye sayin' ye think
I don't believe
that he's my son?

41:43.413 --> 41:44.850
I didna say as much.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.721
Oh, you said a great deal.

41:46.852 --> 41:49.724
And what ye've not said speaks
louder than what ye have.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.334
How dare you
imply such things to me?

41:51.465 --> 41:55.382
I offer you my apology,
Mr. MacKenzie.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.831
But it is only to be understood
that a man might not
feel so kindly

42:09.962 --> 42:11.722
towards a bairn his wife
has borne to another.

42:11.746 --> 42:12.746
But if...

42:12.791 --> 42:13.791
That's enough.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.322
I may not have
any property or money,

42:22.452 --> 42:24.672
but I have time.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.370
And I will give it all
to Brianna and Jeremiah.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.461
Let me put this very plainly.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.289
I do not want your money.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.555
My wife does not
want your money,
and my son will not have it.

42:37.685 --> 42:40.645
Cram it up yer hole, aye?

42:48.870 --> 42:51.133
As you hoped, Mistress?

42:52.961 --> 42:54.180
Even better.

43:00.229 --> 43:01.622
All right, head back.

43:01.753 --> 43:02.971
Open your mouth wide.

43:03.102 --> 43:04.538
Stick out your tongue.

43:04.669 --> 43:05.495
Okay, say "ah."

43:05.626 --> 43:07.410
Ah...

43:07.541 --> 43:09.761
Mm. Abscessed tonsils.

43:09.891 --> 43:12.154
I can remove them.

43:12.285 --> 43:15.114
It'll hurt,
but it'll be better
in the long run.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.201
Ye could do that?

43:16.289 --> 43:17.943
Yes.

43:18.073 --> 43:22.208
Though I wish I had different
medicine and equipment.

43:22.338 --> 43:25.428
That's not it, is it?

43:25.559 --> 43:27.015
'Cause if it is,
I'm feelin' better already.

43:27.039 --> 43:30.085
No, don't worry.

43:30.216 --> 43:33.219
And we don't have
to take them out now.

43:33.349 --> 43:35.003
If Claire does this
for you, lad...

43:35.134 --> 43:36.570
you'll settle at the Ridge?

43:36.701 --> 43:39.312
Do the hunting when I'm away?

43:39.442 --> 43:42.010
We'd be happy to help you.

43:42.141 --> 43:43.141
Thank you.

43:51.585 --> 43:54.414
That brand mark on his hand.

43:54.544 --> 43:56.459
I'm guessing that "T"
stands for "thief"?

43:56.590 --> 43:59.332
Well, who's not stolen
something in his time?

43:59.462 --> 44:02.814
The lad's brought in a great
many deer and beaver skins.

44:05.381 --> 44:07.296
Certainly doesn't sing
for his supper.

44:07.427 --> 44:08.863
Hmm.

44:08.950 --> 44:11.866
Yeah.

44:11.997 --> 44:14.521
I'll leave you to yer patients

44:14.652 --> 44:17.045
and to wage war with yer
wee invisible beasties.

44:17.176 --> 44:18.176
Bacteria.

44:20.135 --> 44:21.615
Certainly does feel like a war.

44:24.096 --> 44:26.011
Then ye must find yerself
a lieutenant.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.670
Right.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.541
Next patient.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.382
Yer Excellency.

44:49.469 --> 44:51.253
Glad to see you up early,
Colonel Fraser.

44:51.384 --> 44:54.648
Early bird and all that.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.956
Still, I suppose it is a kind
of worm you will be catching.

44:58.086 --> 44:59.827
I beg your pardon, sir?

44:59.958 --> 45:01.849
Well, out of respect
for your daughter's wedding,

45:01.873 --> 45:04.745
I deferred speaking of this
until today.

45:04.876 --> 45:07.356
Your endeavors
to cultivate the King's land
have been admirable,

45:07.443 --> 45:10.664
but the time has come
for you to fulfill your oath,

45:10.795 --> 45:15.234
both to the crown and to me,
your benefactor.

45:15.364 --> 45:18.063
Time for that hunt,
Colonel Fraser.

45:18.193 --> 45:20.413
Gather your men.

45:20.543 --> 45:23.285
I want Murtagh Fitzgibbons
and his insurgents
brought to justice.

45:23.416 --> 45:25.897
Be it by rope or by ball,
it matters not one bit to me,

45:26.027 --> 45:29.727
but I want his body
hanging in New Bern
as a warning to all.

45:29.857 --> 45:31.313
This matter is beyond
the Province now.

45:31.337 --> 45:33.948
The people are mindful
of the outcome.

45:34.079 --> 45:36.342
Aye.

45:36.472 --> 45:38.450
Mm.
Lieutenant Knox and his men
will remain to assist you.

45:38.474 --> 45:40.955
I must show my face
to the local sheriffs,

45:41.086 --> 45:43.281
reassure them
that their governor
is taking appropriate measures

45:43.305 --> 45:47.135
to eradicate
this Regulator pestilence.

45:47.266 --> 45:48.615
The indignities and insults

45:48.746 --> 45:52.271
to his Majesty's government
must end.

45:52.401 --> 45:56.666
Chose you for this task
because you know these Scots,
'cause you are one.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.799
Do not disappoint me, Colonel.

46:14.510 --> 46:16.774
We should prepare to leave
within a week.

46:16.861 --> 46:19.221
Will that give you enough time
to put your affairs in order?

46:21.866 --> 46:22.866
Aye.

46:42.234 --> 46:43.626
Shh, shh, shh...

46:53.985 --> 46:58.859
Yesterday was a celebration
of our love for one another.

46:58.990 --> 47:02.167
But today,
and every day from now on,
it's us.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.083
The three of us.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.170
Aye.

47:13.221 --> 47:16.355
Roger, what are you doing?

47:16.485 --> 47:18.245
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

47:23.101 --> 47:26.844
Jeremiah Alexander
Ian Fraser MacKenzie,

47:26.931 --> 47:30.848
you are blood of my blood,
bone of my bone.

47:34.242 --> 47:37.724
I claim thee as my son
before all men,
from this day forever.

47:55.785 --> 47:59.311
Oh, where have you been?

48:01.966 --> 48:04.533
What's the matter?

48:04.664 --> 48:07.841
Tryon is leaving a troop
to aid me in the hunt.

48:10.017 --> 48:12.280
We leave in a week.

48:19.897 --> 48:24.466
And if you refuse
to hunt Murtagh,
then Tryon takes back our land?

48:24.597 --> 48:28.209
He'll brand me a traitor.

48:28.340 --> 48:29.404
I signed an oath to the crown.

48:29.428 --> 48:31.517
Please.

48:31.647 --> 48:35.303
Tryon would renege
on his oath to you
the moment it suited him,

48:35.434 --> 48:36.217
or if he could profit from it.

48:36.304 --> 48:38.654
Aye.

48:38.785 --> 48:42.354
When this war you tell me about
eventually comes,

48:42.484 --> 48:44.443
well, then,
I'll reconsider my vow,

48:44.573 --> 48:48.882
but I dinna have the luxury
of that now.

48:49.013 --> 48:52.755
Because of our family,
our tenants.

48:52.886 --> 48:54.975
If there is a war,

48:55.106 --> 48:57.412
I need to ensure the men
of the Ridge are loyal to me,

48:57.543 --> 48:58.892
not to Tryon.

48:59.023 --> 49:02.461
The men of the Ridge
would do anything for you.

49:05.986 --> 49:06.986
Roger.

49:09.903 --> 49:12.490
If I call up a militia,
he'll be expected to fight,
being fit and of age.

49:12.514 --> 49:15.169
He's not ready for that.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.866
Can't you keep him out of it?

49:18.912 --> 49:20.261
Where are you going?

49:22.002 --> 49:24.439
Tryon wants his Scot.

49:24.526 --> 49:26.224
I'll give him a Scot.

49:44.503 --> 49:47.288
♪

52:01.030 --> 52:02.119
In the Highlands...

52:05.383 --> 52:08.951
When a chieftain
sets himself to war,

52:09.038 --> 52:11.954
he'll burn the fiery cross,

52:12.085 --> 52:16.307
sending a sign throughout
the lands of his clan.

52:16.437 --> 52:20.311
It was a call for his men to...
To gather their weapons,

52:20.441 --> 52:24.184
come, prepared for battle.

52:31.626 --> 52:35.630
We are friends, neighbors,

52:35.761 --> 52:36.805
countrymen.

52:39.591 --> 52:42.159
But we're not a clan.

52:42.289 --> 52:45.597
I'm not yer chief.

52:45.727 --> 52:49.296
But I hope
that if the time comes,
you will all

52:49.427 --> 52:51.037
stand by my side.

52:56.347 --> 53:00.002
We canna say
what might befall us.

53:00.133 --> 53:01.917
But we must not only
be willing to make oaths

53:02.048 --> 53:05.269
to our wives and loved ones,

53:05.356 --> 53:07.184
but to our brothers in arms

53:07.314 --> 53:10.752
in this new country.

53:16.454 --> 53:17.629
Stand by my hand.

53:31.730 --> 53:34.167
I will promise
to stand by your side,
Colonel Fraser, sir.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.659
I swear,

53:47.789 --> 53:50.444
by the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

53:50.575 --> 53:52.185
and by the holy iron
that I hold...

53:52.316 --> 53:54.231
What's happened?

53:54.361 --> 53:56.102
Why are they giving
their oaths to Da now?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.495
Since all the men are here,

53:57.625 --> 53:59.025
your father thought
it would be wise

53:59.105 --> 54:01.194
to prepare for the future.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.675
If ever my hand turn
against you in rebellion,

54:03.805 --> 54:07.940
I ask that this holy iron
pierce my heart.

54:15.513 --> 54:16.513
Roger MacKenzie.

54:18.907 --> 54:20.648
Be a shield for your family
and for mine.

54:22.476 --> 54:24.130
Son of my house.

54:31.224 --> 54:32.747
Captain...

54:32.878 --> 54:34.009
Roger MacKenzie.

54:34.140 --> 54:35.010
Captain?

54:35.141 --> 54:36.838
Aye.

54:36.925 --> 54:38.085
You'll be my safe by my side.

54:40.364 --> 54:41.364
Repeat what I say.

54:43.889 --> 54:45.978
I swear by the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

54:51.331 --> 54:52.680
And by the holy iron
that I hold,

54:52.767 --> 54:54.552
to give ye my fealty,

54:54.682 --> 54:57.685
and I pledge ye my loyalty.

54:57.816 --> 54:59.948
If ever my hand be raised
against ye in rebellion,

55:00.079 --> 55:03.082
I ask that this holy iron
pierce my heart.

55:29.064 --> 55:30.868
I want ye to ken
that this act we're undertaking
