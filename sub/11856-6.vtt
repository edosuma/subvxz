WEBVTT

00:09.041 --> 00:10.959
You didn't tell me
these rows would ache, Ma.

00:11.041 --> 00:12.166
Fashion hurts.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.750
Hurts my eyes, Lutheretta.

00:13.834 --> 00:16.250
Lutheretta?
You callin' me a girl?

00:16.333 --> 00:19.083
It ain't don't
look too tough, that's
all.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.333
I like it, Lu.

00:20.417 --> 00:21.500
There we go.

00:21.583 --> 00:24.458
Look at the poster,
and tell me

00:24.542 --> 00:26.250
I don't look like
"The Answer."

00:26.333 --> 00:27.959
You look like Brandy.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.959
- Hey.
- Cedric, I saw that.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.750
- He needs his strength.
- Uh-huh.

00:38.834 --> 00:40.917
And it's Thanksgivin'
for him, too.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.500
Can I have the wishbone, Vaughn?

00:42.583 --> 00:43.792
Man, what you gonna wish for?

00:43.875 --> 00:46.333
I don't know.
Lots of things.

00:46.417 --> 00:47.542
Uh-uh-uh.

00:47.625 --> 00:48.959
First, we say our thanks.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.125
(Maeve)
'Lord, we're grateful
for the meal'

00:58.208 --> 01:02.291
we are about to receive,
and the blessings of family.

01:02.375 --> 01:03.792
For Vaughn..

01:03.875 --> 01:06.709
'...who stepped into his
daddy's
shoes after his passin'..'

01:06.792 --> 01:10.709
...and for Cedric, always
bringin' home his stray mutts

01:10.792 --> 01:11.792
'and whatnot.'

01:11.875 --> 01:13.625
He ain't a mutt.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.792
And for Quincy, my dreamer

01:15.875 --> 01:17.458
'head in the clouds'

01:17.542 --> 01:20.667
'and Luther, the Answer,
who don't look like Brandy.'

01:20.750 --> 01:22.458
- Much.
- Hey.

01:22.542 --> 01:26.417
'And finally,
for our baby Patrick.'

01:26.500 --> 01:29.333
Let him get any wish he wants.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.291
And for you too, ma.

01:31.375 --> 01:33.417
And for me, too.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.291
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:38.041 --> 01:39.083
Ready.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.750
Aye yo, if I'm being held,
I want a lawyer.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.041
You know what I'm sayin'?

02:44.125 --> 02:45.417
Hey, you wanna
talk
about the murders

02:45.500 --> 02:46.709
just went down, talk.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.000
Otherwise, shut up
till we get to you.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.250
Yo, I ain't seen no murders.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.000
You sit on that stoop all day

02:51.083 --> 02:52.917
but you missed these
gangsters tradin'
shots?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.542
Hey yo, screw all cops,
alright, a thousand times.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.625
That's good attitude, Doughboy.

03:00.834 --> 03:03.000
Hey, boss. We're back
on the line tonight?

03:03.083 --> 03:06.667
Hell, they got a triple. They
need all the help they can
get.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.709
Quiet out here, huh?

03:08.792 --> 03:10.000
Little slice of paradise.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.250
What went down?

03:11.333 --> 03:13.208
Ninth Street Gang
had a shootout with the
O's.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.458
What's the score?

03:14.542 --> 03:15.959
Three dead, one wounded.

03:16.041 --> 03:18.000
All gangsters.
Community service murders.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.208
Anybody talking?

03:19.291 --> 03:20.500
Lot of talk. No help.

03:20.583 --> 03:23.000
(Maeve)
'No! Luther! Is that
Luther?'

03:23.083 --> 03:25.166
'Let me go.
That's my boy out there.'

03:25.250 --> 03:27.041
Do you understand me?

03:28.208 --> 03:32.208
My boy is out there.
That is my son.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.458
I know her.

03:33.542 --> 03:34.709
Yeah?

03:34.792 --> 03:35.917
Her son died.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.750
It was, uh, my first homicide.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.500
Practically makes you friends.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.125
And maybe she'll talk to you.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.625
You-you get out of my face!
Get out of my face!

03:46.709 --> 03:47.959
- Who do you think you are?
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.792
Mrs. Bubley, you remember me?

03:49.875 --> 03:52.250
- I gotta get past this tape.
- You can't do that right now.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.792
I'm Detective Rush.
I worked your son's
murder.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.208
Which son?

03:57.834 --> 03:59.750
It was...in '99.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.333
Vaughn.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.458
Right. Vaughn.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.250
And now we lost Luther.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.583
I'm so sorry.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.625
Don't be sorry, little girl.

04:08.709 --> 04:09.959
Just get out of my way.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.000
Any idea who might have done
this to him?

04:12.083 --> 04:13.291
Like you gonna solve his murder?

04:13.375 --> 04:14.333
I'm gonna try.

04:14.417 --> 04:15.542
Like you solved Vaughn's?

04:15.625 --> 04:18.500
Or Cedric's?
Or Quincy's?

04:18.583 --> 04:19.917
You've lost four sons?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.792
Patrick's all I got left.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.333
And after he gets gunned down

04:24.417 --> 04:26.750
you won't solve
his murder either.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.875
- Sutton comin'?
- She took a leave.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.375
Yeah? She say why?

05:10.458 --> 05:11.959
Just said it was personal.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.250
Four out of five brothers, dead.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.542
All shot in Fairhill,
all unsolved.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.750
Mother give you any
help on who killed
'em?

05:23.834 --> 05:26.542
Mother gave me crap.
Hates cops.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.917
So the shooting last night..

05:29.000 --> 05:31.208
...just another turf war between
the O's and the Ninth Streeters?

05:31.291 --> 05:33.542
Looks that way. But the gang
unit says the leader of the
O's

05:33.625 --> 05:35.583
Miguel Maldonado,
has some kind of running feud

05:35.667 --> 05:37.208
with the Bubley family.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.750
What about?

05:38.834 --> 05:41.166
Don't know, but Miguel's name
is in every one of these boxes

05:41.250 --> 05:42.917
as a person of interest.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.750
So we think he's
behind
all the murders.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.417
What if Luther
didn't just get caught up

05:46.500 --> 05:47.709
in a turf war last night?

05:47.792 --> 05:49.500
Maybe it was personal.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.125
The problem is,
Miguel's untouchable.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.917
'Cause snitches get stitches.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.792
And he's known as a real sadist.

05:55.875 --> 05:58.083
Well, there's one brother
left.
Patrick.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.542
We get someone to finger Miguel

05:59.625 --> 06:01.250
for any of these jobs.
we put him away.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.291
Solve one Bubley murder,
solve 'em all.

06:04.375 --> 06:07.917
And maybe keep Patrick from
joining his brothers here.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.375
Ow! What the hell?

06:19.458 --> 06:21.250
Why'd Luther Bubley shoot you,
Carlos?

06:23.875 --> 06:25.166
I didn't see no
one shoot no one.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.125
We got
preliminary ballistics back.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.792
So?

06:28.875 --> 06:30.875
So Luther's gun
put that hole in your leg.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.083
Maybe he shot me.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.166
Ain't no thing.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.750
And your boys shot him up
outside that market.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.291
Your boss Miguel
tell you to kill Luther?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.583
Over his problem
with the Bubleys?

06:50.667 --> 06:53.959
Bubleys ain't nothin' to Miguel.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.083
- Aah!
- So why's he killing them
off?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.333
You the police.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.333
You can't be gettin' all
torture chamber on me.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.166
Sorry. What?

07:01.250 --> 07:03.041
- Aah! My leg!
- Your what?

07:03.125 --> 07:04.625
Okay! Okay, okay.
Damn!

07:09.083 --> 07:10.750
You a terrible cop,
you know that?

07:10.834 --> 07:15.250
Last night. Yin's market.
How's the shootin' start?

07:15.333 --> 07:17.500
I was jus' goofin' around
on my scooter..

07:23.125 --> 07:25.333
Hey, go grab some milk, man,
I'll grab these flakes,
alright?

07:25.417 --> 07:27.834
- I don't want cereal.
- Yeah, maybe ma wants some.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.333
She don't eat nothin'
but smoke no more.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.417
You got to fill up
before school.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.750
I ain't goin' to school.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.208
So what you sayin'?

07:34.291 --> 07:35.458
You dropped out.
Quit playin' ball.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.083
Yeah, well,
you ain't me,
alright?

07:37.166 --> 07:38.917
I'm not gonna let you
waste
your talent bein' stupid.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.834
You wasted yours.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.166
- Yo, go home, Trick.
- What?

07:56.250 --> 07:57.417
I said go home, now.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.709
Alright, fine.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.041
Whatever.

08:06.542 --> 08:07.875
Yo man. This for Web D.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.834
Fool had no cause to do
what he did.

08:17.917 --> 08:21.166
What was he
talkin' about, Web D?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.792
You find out, you tell me.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.542
Like to know why I was capped.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.583
Thanks, Carlos.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.125
What?

08:37.208 --> 08:39.250
Patrick, this is
Detective
Jeffries.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.166
We spoke to the guy
your brother shot in the
market.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.667
He said you were at the scene.

08:44.750 --> 08:45.917
Nah.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.917
Luther said the
shooting
was for Web D.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.125
What's that mean?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.792
What happened to Luther
don't concern you.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.250
'Cause you're gonna
to take care of it?

08:52.333 --> 08:53.834
Someone's got to.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.667
Maeve.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.417
You again?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.375
We're working on
your sons' murders.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.291
(Jeffries)
'Maeve, my name is Will.'

09:09.375 --> 09:11.125
Look, we need your help here.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.959
Clean out of help
for the police.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.208
We think Miguel
Maldonado's
responsible

09:20.291 --> 09:21.542
for killing your boys.

09:21.625 --> 09:22.917
And?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.125
And if we solve
Luther's murder from last
night

09:25.208 --> 09:26.959
maybe we can close
all your boys'
cases.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.417
I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.041
Come on, let's focus here.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.834
Don't you talk to me like that.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.125
You lost kids? You?

09:36.709 --> 09:39.125
Then get out of here.
I got no use for you.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.792
That's not how you felt
back in '99.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.583
When Vaughn died.
I was there, remember?

09:46.625 --> 09:48.667
You wanted my help then.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.875
(Maeve)
'Oh!'

10:08.959 --> 10:10.625
Aw, crap.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.792
Critter's got family.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.375
Should I...notify 'em?

10:21.458 --> 10:23.625
Yeah. Go on.

10:28.792 --> 10:32.375
I've, I've just
never done it before.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.083
This is the perfect
opportunity, then

10:34.166 --> 10:36.834
because this here
ain't nothin' but an NHI.

10:36.917 --> 10:40.208
- No humans involved.
- Yep.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.291
I don't really believe in that.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.709
Stick around long enough

10:42.792 --> 10:45.709
and your bleeding heart
will run dry real soon.

10:52.792 --> 10:55.625
Oh, that can't be my boy.

10:55.709 --> 10:58.083
- It's Vaughn Bubley.
- Oh, God, no.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.792
Vaughn's dead?

10:59.875 --> 11:03.083
I'm afraid so.

11:03.166 --> 11:06.583
Do you have any idea who might
have done this? Any of you?

11:06.667 --> 11:07.875
He wasn't buying
and
he wasn't bangin'

11:08.000 --> 11:09.417
if that's what you're thinking.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.583
No. I wasn't.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.625
He was a good boy.
He worked hard.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.291
You got to find out
who did this, lady.

11:15.375 --> 11:20.125
He was like a father to his
brothers, you understand?

11:20.208 --> 11:21.709
Yes.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.875
Vaughn's really dead?

11:28.959 --> 11:30.500
I'm sorry.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.166
I ain't gonna make it
without him.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.375
That was a long time back.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.041
We know you've had it rough.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.750
You know?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.500
Well, you understand my life?

11:47.583 --> 11:48.750
I'm trying to, Maeve.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.291
Don't. Don't waste your time.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.333
Dolin' out your sorry ass
pity
like it's gonna do something

11:54.417 --> 11:58.583
when everyone knows
it ain't nothin' but bull.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.458
White policewoman's bull!

12:01.542 --> 12:02.625
Come on, Maeve.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.959
Yup, I got a funeral to plan.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.959
A burial to see to.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.709
Know how much that costs?

12:09.792 --> 12:15.125
Hmm? You think I got money
to pay for another boy
dyin'?

12:15.208 --> 12:21.959
Layin' him to rest in-in-in
any kind of decent way?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.500
Any luck with the Bubleys?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.583
No.

12:49.667 --> 12:53.250
Nothin' on Maldonado? Web D?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.542
A weird thing happened today

12:54.625 --> 12:57.333
when I was talkin'
to the mother.

12:57.417 --> 12:58.500
Yeah?

12:58.583 --> 13:02.417
Ah, she was goin' off
on a tear, and I just..

13:02.500 --> 13:04.166
...tuned out.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.667
Like I didn't care.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.834
You're doing a J-O-B, Lil.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.166
Sometimes that's all there is.

13:11.250 --> 13:16.083
You ever meet my first
partner?
Ben Fulcrum.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.667
Retired now, isn't he?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.750
I keep hearin' his voice
in my head.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.542
- NHI, NHI.
- You're not like that.

13:22.625 --> 13:27.041
I was...today.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.834
So tomorrow will be different.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.333
Maybe. But I'll quit

13:30.417 --> 13:32.166
before I look in the mirror
and start seein'

13:32.250 --> 13:34.083
Fulcrum's face
starin' back at me.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.291
I've seen your old
partner's
face. Nobody wants that.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.291
The Bubleys hate us...boss.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.750
Lot of Fairhill does.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.959
So how do we keep
from hating them back?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.375
Boss say how long
Sutton's on leave?

14:04.458 --> 14:05.792
Nope.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.208
Maybe she ran off
with Sergeant White.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.834
Gil Sherman told me what
really went down at
Northeast.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.792
Yeah? Dish.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.709
It was a one-way thing.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.750
Guy made her life hell
chasing her skirt
around.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.583
So they never..

14:22.667 --> 14:23.750
Mm-mm.

14:24.792 --> 14:26.125
She could've set
the record straight.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.542
Didn't think she had to.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.500
That the security
tape
from the market?

14:29.583 --> 14:32.792
Well, remember how
no one saw nothin'?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.875
Interviewed every one
of those guys, no help.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.125
Same old same old.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.709
Hey, that tall kid
with all the bling.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.291
He's in Quincy
Bubley's file, too.

14:47.375 --> 14:50.417
Theodore Clauson.
Street name "Cartier."

14:50.500 --> 14:51.917
(Rush)
'Busted twice for sellin'
rock.'

14:52.000 --> 14:53.542
And?

14:53.625 --> 14:56.542
Was questioned as a witness
in Quincy Bubley's murder,
'03.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.125
He talk back then?

14:58.208 --> 15:01.500
Says here he couldn't recall
the tragic events in question.

15:01.583 --> 15:05.417
Guy witnessed two Bubleys
get murdered. That's something.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.750
Lied to our faces
the other night.

15:06.834 --> 15:07.959
Why is he gonna talk today?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.083
We'll give him some incentive.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.834
Cartier's got to make a living.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.375
Pay for all that bling.

15:13.458 --> 15:14.875
No drugs today?

15:14.959 --> 15:16.583
Shut him down.

15:25.583 --> 15:31.000
So, I got lemon.
Lemon...and lemon.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.291
- No cherry?
- Lemon.

15:39.417 --> 15:42.166
You guys friends of Cartier's?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.542
Family, actually.

15:43.625 --> 15:44.959
You lookin' to score?

15:45.041 --> 15:46.750
Hook a brother up.

15:46.834 --> 15:49.875
Hey, one sec,
we'll get 'em for you.

15:53.917 --> 15:56.500
Cartier. Got another customer.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.792
(Cartier)
'Oh, yeah, huh?'

15:57.875 --> 15:59.375
Where should we send him?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.041
(Vera)
'Next village over,
to your competition?'

16:01.125 --> 16:03.333
Or a little east, into O-Town?

16:03.417 --> 16:06.667
Man! Y'all messin'
with my livelihood!

16:06.750 --> 16:09.208
Hey, Cartier, hook a brother up.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.041
Are you really as stupid
as you are?

16:11.125 --> 16:12.333
Huh?

16:12.417 --> 16:16.000
No drugs today, Biff.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.542
Okay, okay! I'm playin'.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.917
Why'd Luther Bubley
shoot Carlos?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.917
I don't know. For real.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.875
For real, what's Web D?

16:24.959 --> 16:26.542
Ask me a question I can answer.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.834
'Cause I cannot afford
to have you on my stoop.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.291
(Vera)
'Quincy Bubley, '03. You were
there when he was killed.'

16:31.375 --> 16:32.583
(Jeffries)
'What happened?'

16:32.667 --> 16:35.041
Quincy messed up.
He went out of bounds.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.709
Out of bounds how?

16:36.792 --> 16:37.917
He got desperate
to support his family

16:38.000 --> 16:40.250
after Vaughn and Cedric passed.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.750
Hey, don't anyone know
what day it is?

16:46.834 --> 16:48.500
- Thanksgivin'.
- That's right.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.750
And look what I brought.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.917
You brought chicken
for Thanksgivin'?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.083
And I got the sides.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.000
So get some plates on the table.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.709
(Maeve)
Quincy, you bring me somethin'?

17:01.834 --> 17:05.375
Come on, ma.
Not now.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.750
Alright, no,
no, you're
right.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.375
Uh, Ma, Lu's fixin' you a plate.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.291
Oh no.
I-I-I ain't
hungry.

17:11.375 --> 17:14.000
I-I'll watch you eat.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.208
We should say a blessing.
Like we used to.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.625
Come on, ma,
let's do it.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.417
Alright.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.583
Think I remember how it's done.

17:25.500 --> 17:31.583
Lord, we thank you for the
meal
we're about to receive..

17:31.667 --> 17:34.834
...for the blessings of family..

17:41.375 --> 17:44.083
Keep goin', ma,
you're doing good.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.291
Well, I can't.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.667
I'm sorry.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.667
It's okay.

17:55.750 --> 17:59.125
Yeah. We'll just eat.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.625
But you wait till next year..

18:01.709 --> 18:03.208
You'll see I'll be back
to my old self.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.583
There you go.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.458
You know, get my job,
at the beauty shop back

18:06.542 --> 18:07.792
and get you off the streets.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.417
That sounds good.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.750
Next Thanksgivin', can we have
some of your pumpkin pie?

18:11.834 --> 18:13.917
Aw, now you got me
thinkin' about it.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.834
Well, maybe-maybe,
maybe it ain't too late.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.250
Maybe I can still whip one up.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.375
I'll run to the store
if you want. Get what you
need.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.166
But it's Thanksgivin'.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.667
I'm havin' dinner with..

18:22.750 --> 18:25.542
Yeah, alright. Alright.

18:25.625 --> 18:26.959
I'm comin'.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.000
I gotta go, ma.
Sorry.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.500
We'll save a slice of pie
for you.

18:33.583 --> 18:34.834
Maybe.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.917
Come on, we gotta go.

18:42.208 --> 18:46.125
All gonna be different, Quincy.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.959
You see who pulled the trigger?

19:00.041 --> 19:02.208
Flash of light,
screeching tires.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.417
But you got a notion.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.375
Told you,
Quincy
was desperate

19:05.458 --> 19:07.834
to make bank, to do
right
for his family.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.041
And?

19:09.125 --> 19:10.792
And he branched out.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.250
Started sellin'
on the wrong block.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.792
Whose block?

19:18.125 --> 19:19.959
Jesus Maldonado.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.750
Miguel's cousin.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.083
Why don't Miguel call me?

19:36.166 --> 19:37.291
I guess he's busy.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.250
He's gonna be a daddy.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.083
That's Miguel's girl.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.583
Five-O! Five-O!

19:43.667 --> 19:45.500
Hey, what are you doin'?

19:49.208 --> 19:50.458
Hey.

19:50.542 --> 19:53.750
Jesus Maldonado?

19:53.834 --> 19:56.917
- What do you want?
- Let's have a chat.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.750
- When's the baby coming?
- I don't know.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.750
Can take you to see a doctor.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.333
Why do you care?
Ain't like you knocked me up.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.291
I know a clinic nearby.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.875
And you gonna get me in?

20:08.959 --> 20:11.458
I'll take you there. We'll
talk
about the daddy to be.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.083
I ain't no snitch.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.000
- What is he hasslin' my woman?
- Your woman?

20:20.083 --> 20:22.834
- Thought she was Miguel's.
- Whatever.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.959
She's pretty.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.291
(Valens)
Hanging with bangers though.
That can get her in trouble.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.500
Bull.

20:29.583 --> 20:32.000
DHS gets word,
they take the baby.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.291
- Close that up, man.
- That mean you gonna
talk?

20:41.375 --> 20:43.250
- About what?
- Quincy Bubley.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.792
Sold on your corner in '03.
Got shot up for it.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.083
Nah.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.667
Miguel give those orders?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.083
Then I hate doin' this.
Baby should be with their ma.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.917
Oh, come on, man.
Don't twist her
up.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.166
Why's Miguel got it out
for the Bubleys?

20:57.250 --> 20:58.583
Bubleys bring it on themselves.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.041
They are at fault of dyin'?

21:00.125 --> 21:02.041
They're defective,
man.
They got bad genes.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.667
- Aw, you made a study.
- Nah, I seen it for myself.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.625
The night Cedric
Bubley
was killed.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.208
Why you on me like that
when you know I'm Miguel's
girl?

21:19.291 --> 21:21.667
He don't care
about you, Letecia.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.208
He just don't like to show it.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.333
Don't you know
he's all wrong for you?

21:25.417 --> 21:27.709
- And you're right?
- I'll prove it.

21:30.375 --> 21:31.709
I'm with your cousin.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.417
And he's with about
ten other girls too.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.834
Don't you wanna be special?

21:35.834 --> 21:38.375
I wanna see Miguel.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.333
Probably up there
with one of them now.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.458
You shut up, Jesus.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.500
But Maeve Bubley was partying

22:14.583 --> 22:16.041
with the man
who's killing off her kids.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.250
The same night one
of 'em gets dead.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.500
You see what I'm
saying
about bad genes?

22:23.792 --> 22:25.208
That's cold.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.625
Mom like you, Maeve..

22:34.709 --> 22:37.750
...it's a wonder
you have any boys left alive.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.542
You are one tight-assed bitch,
you know that?

22:40.625 --> 22:43.375
And to think I actually
felt bad for you.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.667
Well, Cedric's body
wasn't even cold yet.

22:45.750 --> 22:46.792
(Rush)
'And you're lighting up
with his killer.'

22:46.875 --> 22:48.250
That's what you think, huh?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.417
I think you know why
Miguel's killing your boys.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.458
You're so desperate to get
your
high on you don't even care.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.000
I wanna leave.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.125
That rock in your apartment,
says you're staying.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.458
I ain't talkin'
about that night.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.166
You wanna stonewall?
Go ahead.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.417
Stay here, get good
and dopesick.

23:26.834 --> 23:29.041
Miguel ever finds out I let
a cop take me to the
doctors--

23:29.125 --> 23:30.625
He's the one that should
be here with you.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.458
Yeah, well..

23:32.542 --> 23:33.959
Too busy, huh?

23:34.041 --> 23:35.125
Killing off kids.

23:36.542 --> 23:39.333
I said I ain't a snitch.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.834
'You know Maeve Bubley?'

23:40.917 --> 23:43.667
Lady you saw Miguel smoking
crack with at the O's one
night?

23:43.750 --> 23:45.542
Yeah. So?

23:48.625 --> 23:50.417
What was she doing there?

23:51.917 --> 23:54.917
Miguel don't
tell me
nothing.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.333
So he never confided
he murdered four of her sons?

24:02.750 --> 24:05.375
Got any feelings
about that?

24:06.458 --> 24:08.166
He's bad.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.667
I know.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.333
Is he bad to you?

24:12.417 --> 24:15.208
Runs with other girls?

24:15.291 --> 24:18.166
Gets you in this situation,
<i>adios?</i>

24:20.875 --> 24:24.000
- Yeah.
- So why are you loyal to him?

24:24.083 --> 24:25.583
He ain't to you.

24:31.792 --> 24:35.291
All I know about that woman
is one of her sons asked for
it.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.250
Which one?

24:37.333 --> 24:39.792
Sorry-looking
one,
with glasses.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.000
Cedric?

24:42.083 --> 24:43.125
Yeah.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.709
Same night she was
at the party, but
earlier..

24:46.792 --> 24:49.125
...when we was
out
for dinner.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.875
Miguel Maldonado.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.125
Who's askin'?

25:10.333 --> 25:11.959
You killed my brother, Vaughn.

25:13.917 --> 25:14.959
Vaughn?

25:16.792 --> 25:18.417
He Urkel-looking like you?

25:18.500 --> 25:24.250
It's been two years,
and my family...can't get
back.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.208
Two years.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.542
And you just found
<i>cojones?</i>

25:29.959 --> 25:32.250
We tried gettin' better,
but what you took..

25:33.834 --> 25:35.250
...we're still missin'.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.041
What do you want me
to do about it?

25:40.125 --> 25:42.625
- 'Unh-unh.'
- This is for Web D.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.166
Come on, then!

25:46.250 --> 25:47.250
(Letecia)
'I know you.'

25:47.333 --> 25:50.291
You work at the pet store.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.458
You sold me
a scratch post.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.458
Come on now, pet boy, shoot!

26:03.959 --> 26:06.417
You ruined our family.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.834
You should've pulled the
trigger
when you had a chance!

26:20.709 --> 26:23.000
So Miguel set after him?

26:23.083 --> 26:24.834
I just know he got
shot
that night.

26:26.208 --> 26:28.208
Probably not a coincidence.

26:34.709 --> 26:36.291
I know you're right.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.709
Miguel's no good.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.375
But I'm hung
up
on him.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.625
Bet he'll make
a hell of a parent.

26:50.250 --> 26:54.375
So, Miguel kills Vaughn in '99.

26:54.458 --> 26:57.542
And Cedric gets killed in
'01,
trying to get payback.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.667
Leaving the Bubleys
without a breadwinner.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.291
Quincy gets desperate, starts
selling on the wrong corner.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.500
(Jeffries)
'Gets himself shot'

27:03.583 --> 27:06.000
by the O's.
Thanksgiving, '03.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.083
Then Luther trades shots
with another O

27:08.166 --> 27:10.083
at Yin's,
a couple nights ago.

27:10.166 --> 27:11.875
And says it's for Web D.

27:11.959 --> 27:14.959
Why did Miguel kill Vaughn
in the first place?

27:15.041 --> 27:18.875
And what's this Web D
everyone's dying over?

27:18.959 --> 27:21.125
Where's my mom?

27:21.208 --> 27:22.542
I bet he knows.

27:22.625 --> 27:25.208
Alright,
just settle down, son.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.291
Uh, it's okay.

27:26.375 --> 27:27.250
Come on.

27:27.333 --> 27:28.959
I know you
got her
here.

27:31.208 --> 27:33.542
I got a hold
of your report cards, Patrick.

27:33.625 --> 27:34.709
From elementary school.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.041
You gonna tell me
where she is or not?

27:36.125 --> 27:37.875
Now, you were
a gifted
student.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.333
Honors classes.

27:39.417 --> 27:40.917
Then I checked
out
high school.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.333
You're failing out.

27:43.417 --> 27:46.458
I got other things to tend to.

27:46.542 --> 27:47.959
What's Web D?

27:49.291 --> 27:50.625
Why'd Miguel kill Vaughn?

27:50.709 --> 27:52.333
I wanna see my mom.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.875
- Now!
- Think I care what you want?

27:54.959 --> 27:55.917
Yeah, that's right.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.250
Showing your true colors now.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.041
Well, I'm busy, Patrick.

28:00.125 --> 28:01.083
You wanna know why
I won't talk to you?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.333
[chuckles]
Not really.

28:02.417 --> 28:03.583
'Cause you look
at people like us

28:03.667 --> 28:05.083
and think NHI.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.625
No humans involved.

28:06.709 --> 28:08.625
Think what you want,
just get outta my
face.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.792
Guess who's crying out
for room service?

28:31.917 --> 28:33.125
Twitchin' pretty bad,
huh, Maeve?

28:33.208 --> 28:34.291
I tell you
what you want

28:34.375 --> 28:35.458
you let me out of here?

28:35.542 --> 28:36.959
You don't make the deals, we do.

28:37.041 --> 28:38.250
I gotta get what I need.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.834
Then start talking about Miguel.

28:39.917 --> 28:41.875
Why you were at his place,
the night Cedric was killed.

28:41.959 --> 28:44.125
It wasn't for drugs,
like you think.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.583
I was clean my whole life
before then.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.333
We don't care
about your drug history.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.291
Just why you were partying
with Miguel.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.417
You can't tell Patrick.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.083
Crack making you deaf?

29:00.208 --> 29:02.375
You talk, we deal.

29:04.083 --> 29:07.291
Alright, I'll tell you.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.750
And I hope you choke on it.

29:15.208 --> 29:20.375
They say my boy Cedric,
is in a dumpster...someplace.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.625
Okay.

29:25.709 --> 29:28.625
There's a lot
of those in
Fairhill.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.166
This the boy who...
put a gun on my girl?

29:38.250 --> 29:39.834
I gotta find him.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.417
Bury him right.

29:49.208 --> 29:51.375
I feel you.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.500
'But..'

29:54.583 --> 29:56.041
...ain't nothing free.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.542
I don't got no money.

29:57.625 --> 30:00.083
There are other ways
to pay, you know.

30:02.792 --> 30:03.834
Just..

30:06.208 --> 30:07.583
Please..

30:09.792 --> 30:11.792
Tell me where my son is.

30:18.709 --> 30:21.125
This is my trigger finger.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.709
You gonna start here.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.500
No.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.333
Come on.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.500
You wanna suck on this first?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.083
Get you warmed up?

30:54.917 --> 30:57.125
He say where Cedric was?

31:00.375 --> 31:02.333
In alley dumpster.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.417
Cast off like trash.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.458
Happy now?

31:20.709 --> 31:22.458
No.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.917
You wanna finish me off?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.458
Go on...tell Patrick.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.250
We won't, Maeve.

31:33.250 --> 31:36.125
Then I can get the hell
outta here?

31:36.959 --> 31:39.333
Go get what I need?

31:53.625 --> 31:55.583
DA's office say
we could charge Miguel?

31:55.667 --> 31:58.542
We can arrest him
for sexual
assault.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.834
But the case
will never
make.

32:00.917 --> 32:02.375
'Cause Maeve
won't testify.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.166
But Miguel doesn't know that.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.333
Neither does Jesus.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.041
So, let's make a deal with him.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.542
Get him to flip on his cousin.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.000
Well, then he
takes over the O's.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.041
We replace one Maldonado
for another.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.500
It's better than doing nothing.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.750
Patrick Bubley's not gonna
care
who's running the O's.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.417
He's gonna want
revenge either way.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.917
We ain't gonna
get them both, Lil.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.917
Yeah, we gotta pick our
battles,
win the ones we can.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.125
Well, it's no win if Maeve
loses her last son.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.834
You got a better idea?

32:38.041 --> 32:40.125
You ain't got
nothin' on me.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.750
Keep walking
and shut up.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.834
- I ain't do nothin'.
- I said shut it, Miguel.

32:45.625 --> 32:46.709
Ain't no thang.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.041
I ain't sweatin', cuz.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.125
Yeah, you will be.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.667
Hey, what?
You wanna go with him?

33:16.417 --> 33:17.750
Get out.

33:17.834 --> 33:19.291
Come on.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.125
You gonna kick
my ass now or what?

33:23.208 --> 33:24.792
I wish.

33:24.875 --> 33:26.625
(Valens)
'Yeah, we know Miguel killed
those four brothers.'

33:26.709 --> 33:28.208
We just can't prove it.

33:29.792 --> 33:31.000
Well, that's
your problem.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.500
Well, let's think
for a second here.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.542
You really want Miguel
back out on the street?

33:34.625 --> 33:36.125
'Cause it had occurred
to us that maybe you
want

33:36.208 --> 33:37.125
to run the O's yourself.

33:37.208 --> 33:39.250
If someone's got to be king..

33:39.333 --> 33:41.125
...maybe now you
finally
get your queen.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.458
- 'Letecia.'
- Hey, don't talk about her.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.125
She's hung up
on Miguel right now

33:45.208 --> 33:47.542
but how long
is that gonna last?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.417
Her man rotting away
in a jail cell?

33:49.500 --> 33:51.083
She's gonna move on.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.208
Miguel's my blood.

33:53.291 --> 33:55.041
So's that kid she's having.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.083
He's gonna need a father.

33:59.917 --> 34:02.917
You give us
something
real, Jesus.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.625
Miguel never steps
foot in O-Town
again.

34:09.333 --> 34:11.917
Vaughn Bubley. 1999.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.583
How'd it go down?

34:17.041 --> 34:18.792
Wrong is how it went.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.375
All wrong.

34:23.875 --> 34:24.917
(Vaughn)
'That's it, Trick.'

34:25.000 --> 34:26.041
All you gotta do is push off

34:26.125 --> 34:27.083
and then float.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.709
Push and float.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.709
Yeah, that's it, little man.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.166
Push and float.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.458
Yeah, push and float.

34:34.542 --> 34:35.792
Whoa.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.208
Check me out, V, I'm flying!

34:47.125 --> 34:49.208
She just showed up.
Hey, hey, hey!

34:49.291 --> 34:50.417
'What's up, little brother?'

34:50.500 --> 34:52.375
- This is my alley.
- Sorry.

34:55.750 --> 34:56.834
(Vaughn)
'Hey!'

34:57.750 --> 34:59.083
What are you doing?

35:01.458 --> 35:03.875
Well, taking this.

35:03.959 --> 35:05.834
Go home, Patrick.

35:05.917 --> 35:07.333
Nah. I ain't leaving
you here alone.

35:07.417 --> 35:08.792
Look, I said, go home.

35:14.333 --> 35:17.959
Look, that scooter
means a lot to my brother.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.959
A lot to me, too.

35:21.041 --> 35:23.625
This scooter ain't
his no more.

35:23.709 --> 35:27.667
Look, man, I 'm
asking
you...with respect.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.792
Please, give me
back the
scooter.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.166
Come on, cuz,
it's only a scooter.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.542
Then, tell that to him, bro.
What's up?

35:33.625 --> 35:35.208
- What you doing, man?
- I ain't lettin' go.

35:35.291 --> 35:38.208
I ain't lettin' go, man!

35:38.291 --> 35:39.792
Man, I'll hit ya.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.667
You win, dawg.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.041
And here's your prize!

36:04.208 --> 36:05.625
Four boys dead.

36:05.709 --> 36:07.792
All over a scooter.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.208
Where we going?

36:19.291 --> 36:21.750
I wanna show you
something.

36:21.834 --> 36:24.750
We've arrested Miguel Maldonado

36:24.834 --> 36:27.250
for killing Vaughn.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.583
So who took over the O's?

36:29.667 --> 36:31.083
Now, you going after them, huh?

36:33.333 --> 36:38.083
Road you're going down,
Patrick,
leads right here.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.208
There's a spot open..

36:50.375 --> 36:52.208
...next to your brothers.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.208
Maybe that's just how it goes.

36:56.291 --> 36:58.458
Patrick, you're 15.

36:58.542 --> 37:01.834
'You're just beginning
your life.'

37:04.875 --> 37:06.083
I got their
deaths
on my back.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.750
You think
they want this for you?

37:07.834 --> 37:08.917
Think your mom wants that?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.208
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.041
But I need to.

37:14.125 --> 37:15.166
Why?

37:18.792 --> 37:21.709
'Cause it's how I stay human.

37:26.583 --> 37:28.834
You are gonna make it
without 'em.

37:33.375 --> 37:36.333
Tell me what Web D is.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.166
Nothing but dead air.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.583
It's gotta be something.

37:40.667 --> 37:44.834
I don't believe four boys
are dead over a scooter.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.917
It wasn't just a scooter.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.875
It stood for something?

37:50.500 --> 37:51.583
Everything.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.667
And now for the winner
of the 1999

37:57.750 --> 38:00.375
WEB Du Bois Essay Contest..

38:02.083 --> 38:03.542
...Patrick Bubley.

38:04.625 --> 38:05.542
Come on over here, son.

38:05.625 --> 38:07.458
Get your brand-new scooter.

38:10.583 --> 38:12.166
Now, I'm sure the audience
would like to hear some

38:12.250 --> 38:14.417
of that winning
essay of yours.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.291
You want me to read it? Now?

38:16.375 --> 38:17.417
Maybe just the beginning.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.542
Alright.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.375
"In our city of Philadelphia

38:22.458 --> 38:26.166
"in 1910, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote

38:26.250 --> 38:29.125
"There is in this world
no such force

38:29.208 --> 38:31.125
as the force of a person
determined to rise."

38:31.208 --> 38:33.208
And I wrote about
how I think so, too.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.709
You did so good, Patrick.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.250
You know what I'm gonna
call my scooter?

38:43.333 --> 38:44.250
What, little man?

38:44.333 --> 38:46.625
Web D, like W.E.B. Du Bois.

38:48.458 --> 38:49.458
Web D.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.291
That's good, Trick.
I like that.

38:51.375 --> 38:52.667
Teach me how to ride.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.500
Oh, yeah, man.
It's easy.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.500
All you gotta do
is push off and then float.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.291
Push and float.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.500
Push and float.
