<i>BOY MEETS WORLD... </i>

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
SURPRISE.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.400
GOOD. WELL, I'M GLAD
WE CLEARED THIS UP.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.667
CORY, IF YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE, I WILL, BUT I
NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.200
YOU NEVER ANSWERED
MY LETTER,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
AND I NEEDED TO KNOW
IF WHAT WE HAD WAS JUST
BECAUSE OF THE FIREPLACE

00:52.000 --> 00:53.967
AND THE MOUNTAINS
AND THE SKY--

00:53.967 --> 00:56.233
LAUREN, I'M MEETING
TOPANGA HERE, OK?

00:56.233 --> 01:00.467
AND I--REALLY, I DON'T
WANT HER TO SEE US
TOGETHER.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.967
I LIKE LAUREN.

01:04.967 --> 01:07.734
I LIKE SPENDING TIME
WITH HER.

01:10.133 --> 01:12.967
BUT I CAN LIVE
WITHOUT HER.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.934
I--I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT TOPANGA.

01:16.934 --> 01:20.100
CORY, I CAN'T
SEE YOU ANYMORE.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.900
WHAT?

01:23.900 --> 01:26.900
YOU'RE GOING TO KISS ME
NOW, AREN'T YOU?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FELT
WHEN HE KISSED ME?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.133
YEAH, I PROBABLY DO.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.700
NOTHING.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.734
WHAT?

01:42.734 --> 01:44.967
I CALLED HIM TODAY
TO LET HIM KNOW

01:44.967 --> 01:47.734
I CAN'T EVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

01:47.734 --> 01:48.800
YOU DID?

01:48.800 --> 01:51.200
BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE,
ANGELA.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.767
I DON'T MEAN HIGH SCHOOL
"I LOVE YOU,
I LOVE YOU, TOO."

01:54.767 --> 01:59.500
I MEAN I AM IN LOVE
WITH CORY MATTHEWS,

01:59.500 --> 02:00.700
AND I WANT TO BE.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.300
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD FOR ME,

02:02.300 --> 02:04.000
AND THERE NEVER WILL BE.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.767
I'M TAKEN.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.300
SO ARE WE STARTING OVER?

02:21.300 --> 02:23.600
YEAH.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.500
Topanga and Cory:
MORNING, MR. FEENY.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.800
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.700
YOU'RE SITTING TOGETHER.
YOU'RE TALKING IN UNISON?

02:35.700 --> 02:36.700
EVERYTHING'S BETTER.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.400
WE WORKED OUT
OUR DIFFERENCES.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.600
WE GOT BACK TOGETHER.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.400
OH, WELL, GOOD.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.734
AW, SHUCKS.

02:42.734 --> 02:45.300
AND I'M SURE I'M NOT HALF
AS THRILLED AS SHAWN WAS

02:45.300 --> 02:47.400
WHEN YOU TOLD HIM
THE GOOD NEWS.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.200
OH, NO.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.800
I MEAN, HE WAS EVEN MORE
BROKEN-HEARTED THAN YOU 2.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.900
YOU DID TELL SHAWN,
DIDN'T YOU?

02:53.900 --> 02:56.767
WELL, WE JUST GOT
BACK TOGETHER LAST NIGHT.

02:56.767 --> 02:59.133
I'VE HAD A LOT OF STUFF
ON MY MIND.

02:59.133 --> 03:02.033
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD SHAWN
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.100
CORY.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.233
IT'S OK. I MEAN,
WE'LL TELL HIM NOW.

03:04.233 --> 03:06.567
IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYBODY ELSE KNOWS,
RIGHT?

03:06.567 --> 03:08.667
All: CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU GUYS.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.867
OH, MY GOSH. SHAWN
IS GOING TO KILL ME

03:10.867 --> 03:12.500
IF HE FINDS OUT
HE WAS NOT THE FIRST
PERSON TO KNOW.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.834
HE TRIED EVERY WAY
HE KNEW HOW TO GET US
BACK TOGETHER.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.467
OK, LISTEN. THERE IS
ONLY ONE THING TO DO.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.200
HO HO!

03:18.200 --> 03:22.100
IS THAT THE STUPID IDEA TRAIN
COMING 'ROUND THE BEND?

03:22.100 --> 03:27.000
WE HAVE TO PRETEND
TO STILL BE APART
FOR HIS SAKE.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.200
ALL ABOARD!

03:28.200 --> 03:29.834
WHOO-WHOO!

03:29.834 --> 03:30.967
IT IS SO SIMPLE.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.734
WE'LL SET IT UP
SO HE CAN REUNITE US.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.400
IT'S A GREAT PLAN!

03:34.400 --> 03:36.667
IT'S NOT A GREAT PLAN.
IT'S AN ANTI-GREAT PLAN.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.600
IF I MAY, 5 WORDS.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.300
TOPANGA IS CORRECT.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.900
THAT'S ONLY 3.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.500
YOU MORON.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
OK, FINE.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.900
LISTEN, TOPANGA,
YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.000
HELP ME CONVINCE SHAWN
IT'S UP TO HIM TO GET US
BACK TOGETHER.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.700
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

03:51.700 --> 03:53.400
SHH!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.133
BECAUSE LOOK AT HIM.

03:56.133 --> 03:59.600
HE BLEEDS FOR US.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.600
YOU AND I COULD MAKE HIM
THE HAPPIEST GUY
IN THE UNIVERSE.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.200
OH, THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY
COME OUT WELL.

04:07.734 --> 04:10.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SAID THAT TO ME,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.734
YOU STUNTED LITTLE WHINY
BRILLO HEAD!

04:13.800 --> 04:14.834
WOW!

04:14.834 --> 04:15.900
OH, YEAH?

04:15.900 --> 04:18.600
WELL, YOU'RE A SHORT
LITTLE NASAL-VOICED

04:18.600 --> 04:19.900
BLIMPO-LIPPED--

04:19.900 --> 04:21.767
SO AND SO.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.467
[SOFTLY]
I NEED MORE TIME.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.600
WHEN WILL THIS
MADNESS END?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.834
VERY SOON, I HOPE.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.000
IT'S ALL SO CRAZY.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.133
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST
CLINGING TO THE WRECKAGE.

04:34.133 --> 04:38.033
WELL, DAY 53
OF THE WRECKAGE.

04:38.033 --> 04:41.667
YOU KISS MY BLIMPO LIPS
AND TELL THEM
YOU'RE SORRY.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.300
WELL, I WOULD,
BUT MY BRILLO HEAD

04:44.300 --> 04:45.967
MIGHT POKE YOUR EYES OUT.

04:45.967 --> 04:47.000
I'M SORRY.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.300
OK.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.834
NOW, LET'S BE MAD
AT EACH OTHER.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.467
GRRR!

04:54.967 --> 04:57.934
WHOO--WHOO!

05:01.400 --> 05:02.700
YOUR PLAN IS WORKING.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.300
SHAWN STILL THINKS
YOU'RE APART.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE WERE EVER APART,
MY LITTLE LOVE DUMPLING.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.867
WITH PLUM SAUCE.

05:09.867 --> 05:13.300
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU BOTH SICKEN ME.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.133
I KNOW
THIS IS WRONG,

05:15.133 --> 05:16.900
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
STARTING TO ENJOY

05:16.900 --> 05:18.600
THIS DECEITFUL
LITTLE GAME.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.200
YOU ARE? REALLY?

05:20.200 --> 05:24.200
YEAH. I MEAN, DON'T YOU
FIND IT SEXY, CORY?

05:24.200 --> 05:28.300
CORY AND SEXY
IN THE SAME SENTENCE, WOW.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.200
I DO BELIEVE YOUR RESOLVE
IS WEAKENING, MY LITTLE
KUMQUAT.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.100
I WANT TO KISS YOU
SO BAD.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.500
THIS SNEAKING AROUND STUFF
SEEMS TO BE AGREEING
WITH YOU.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
ONLY IF I CAN BE
SNEAKY WITH YOU.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.700
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU SICKEN ME, TOO.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.000
AND I HAVE SERIOUS
MISGIVINGS

05:46.000 --> 05:49.200
ABOUT BEING PART
OF YOUR LITTLE--

05:49.200 --> 05:51.100
BIG HORN...

05:51.100 --> 05:54.867
WHERE GENERAL CUSTER
AND HIS WIFE...

05:54.867 --> 05:56.600
MRS. CUSTER...

05:56.600 --> 05:58.734
HAD A BEACH HOUSE.

05:59.967 --> 06:03.000
OH, I'M WAY TOO INVOLVED.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.467
HERE HE COMES.
ALL SET?

06:09.467 --> 06:10.500
ALL SET.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.367
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MANY GOOD YEARS

06:12.367 --> 06:13.967
I'VE WASTED ON YOU,
CORY MATTHEWS!

06:13.967 --> 06:17.300
BUT, TOPANGA, THINK
OF EVERYTHING WE'VE HAD,

06:17.300 --> 06:18.767
EVERYTHING WE'VE SHARED.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.834
SURE, WE'VE HAD SOME KICKS,
A FEW LAUGHS.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.400
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

06:22.400 --> 06:26.233
BEFORE YOU SPENT TIME
WITH THAT SKINNY-LIPPED
SKI BUNNY.

06:26.233 --> 06:27.233
AAH!

06:27.233 --> 06:28.900
SHE HAS A NAME.

06:28.900 --> 06:31.300
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
ANYMORE.

06:32.367 --> 06:34.500
SHAWN! WE NEED YOUR HELP.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
BUT IT'S HOPELESS.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.033
NO, IT IS NOT HOPELESS.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.400
YES, IT IS.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.934
CORY, LOOK AT HOW
CALLOUS AND UNCARING
SHE IS ABOUT YOU.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.967
LOOK AT HER AGAIN.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.767
NAH, SHE'S LIKE ICE.

06:54.567 --> 06:55.567
HEY.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.500
WHAT ARE THESE
TEARS, TOPANGA?

06:57.500 --> 07:01.567
ARE--ARE THESE
THE TEARS OF HOPE?

07:01.567 --> 07:02.900
MAYBE A LITTLE.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.200
BUT I JUST SAW HIM
PLEADING WITH YOU
TO TAKE HIM BACK,

07:05.200 --> 07:06.700
AND YOU DIDN'T.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.100
THAT WASN'T MY HEART
TALKING, SHAWN.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.000
CORY AND I ARE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.033
I JUST FEAR THAT
THERE'S TOO MUCH
DAMAGE DONE

07:13.033 --> 07:15.934
FOR US TO PUT US
BACK TOGETHER OURSELVES.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.500
YOU ARE OUR LAST HOPE.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.734
REALLY?

07:20.734 --> 07:21.834
I AM?

07:21.834 --> 07:24.300
BUT I'M SURE ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS SAY SO,

07:24.300 --> 07:25.500
AND HE'LL COME RUNNING.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.033
IF ONLY IT WERE
THAT EASY.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.100
ONE OF THE THINGS
I LOVE MOST ABOUT CORY
IS HIS FIERCE PRIDE.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.233
THAT'S CRAZY. I'VE KNOWN
CORY ALL MY LIFE.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.900
HE HAS NO PRIDE AT ALL.

07:35.900 --> 07:36.967
WATCH THIS.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.967
HEY, COR, I THINK
SHE'LL TAKE YOU BACK.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.867
SHE CAN ROT IN HELL.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.667
WOW. YOU KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.700
SAY YOU'LL HELP US.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.233
PERHAPS YOU THOUGHT
I'D USED UP ALL MY
EMOTIONAL STRENGTH

07:53.233 --> 07:55.834
OVER THE LAST 53 DAYS,

07:55.834 --> 07:59.233
BUT I HAVE KEPT
JUST A LITTLE

07:59.233 --> 08:00.066
RIGHT HERE,

08:00.066 --> 08:02.200
IN THE PUMPER,

08:02.200 --> 08:04.734
FOR I ALWAYS KNEW
THIS DAY WOULD COME,

08:04.734 --> 08:08.000
AND I AM PREPARED FOR YOU,
MY BELOVED FRIENDS,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.834
TO SQUEEZE OUT
THE LAST DROP OF MY
EMOTIONAL TOOTHPASTE.

08:13.834 --> 08:14.934
I'M TELLING HIM.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.734
HE'S MAKING A SPEECH.
LET HIM TALK.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.900
I WILL SAVE YOU 2.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.600
OH, YES.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.467
I WILL.

08:25.033 --> 08:27.000
WHAT A JERK.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.867
SHE CAN ROT IN HELL?

08:29.867 --> 08:31.033
IT'S TOO MUCH?

08:31.033 --> 08:32.400
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.667
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD AT--

08:34.667 --> 08:35.667
WHOA.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.667
I WAS ACTUALLY--
I WAS GOING TO SAY,

08:37.667 --> 08:39.600
YOU'RE GOOD
AT FIELD HOCKEY,

08:39.600 --> 08:42.467
BUT YOU'RE GOOD
AT THIS, TOO.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.600
HEY, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT CORY AND TOPANGA.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.100
ARE THEY STILL ESTRANGED?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.300
THAT WAS ON MY
WORD-A-DAY CALENDAR.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.600
GOOD THING YOU ASKED ME
TODAY, TOO,

08:57.600 --> 09:00.400
BECAUSE IF YOU ASKED ME
TOMORROW, I WOULD'VE SAID

09:00.400 --> 09:02.500
ARE THEY STILL "ESTRANGED"?
HEY.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.400
I THINK THEY BOTH WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.767
THEY JUST NEED ME
TO GIVE THEM A PUSH
IN THE RIGHT--YOU KNOW.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.500
ESTRANGED?

09:11.600 --> 09:13.600
YEAH, STRANGED.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.300
HE'S GETTING WORSE.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.100
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO HELP THEM ALL ALONG,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.500
BUT NOTHING I DO WORKS.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.467
THEIR--THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IS JUST MORE COMPLICATED
THAN MOST.

09:24.467 --> 09:25.900
THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

09:25.900 --> 09:27.967
IF I FIGURED OUT
WHY THEY'RE DIFFERENT,

09:27.967 --> 09:29.300
MAYBE I COULD HELP THEM.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.200
THEY'RE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE THEY LOVE
EACH OTHER.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
THEN WHY DID THEY BREAK UP?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.033
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW
I NEED TO HELP THEM.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.367
NO! YOU CAN'T
HELP THEM TODAY.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.734
TODAY'S ESTRANGED DAY,
AND SO IS TOMORROW.

09:40.734 --> 09:43.233
YOU CAN'T GET THEM BACK
TOGETHER ON ESTRANGED DAY.

09:43.233 --> 09:46.100
YOU GOT TO WAIT
TILL THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.700
WHY?
WHAT WORD IS THAT?

09:47.700 --> 09:49.367
THAT WOULD BE "ESTRANGED."

09:49.367 --> 09:50.567
HE-E-EY!

09:50.567 --> 09:54.367
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I BUY ANYTHING FROM

09:54.367 --> 09:59.500
http://www.howdysucker.com.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.734
ALL RIGHT.
GET IN THE SHED.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.967
I HATE THIS.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
OK, SHAWN, HOW ARE YOU

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
GOING TO SAVE OUR DOOMED
RELATIONSHIP?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.300
IT'S NOT DOOMED.
IT'S JUST HOPELESS.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.200
GOOD.
GOOD FOR BOTH OF YOU.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.834
ADMITTING THERE'S
A PROBLEM IS ALWAYS

10:12.834 --> 10:14.300
THE FIRST STEP
IN RECOVERY.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.600
OK, SO WHAT DO WE DO?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.500
WELL, THE FIRST THING
WE ALL HAVE TO REALIZE IS

10:17.500 --> 10:19.700
THAT THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE TIME.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.934
TIME.
TIME IS IT.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.800
AND IT MIGHT NOT EVEN
HAPPEN SOON.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.967
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE COULD
WAKE UP TOMORROW...

10:24.967 --> 10:26.467
AND BE BACK TOGETHER!

10:26.467 --> 10:27.800
SHAWN, THANKS, BUDDY!

10:27.800 --> 10:30.000
LET'S JUST SEE
WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.367
OK. SO, WE ALL KNOW
THAT THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE

10:32.367 --> 10:33.800
AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF TIME.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.200
'CAUSE, WELL, HE KISSED
ANOTHER GIRL

10:35.200 --> 10:37.567
AND THEN HE WENT
ON A DATE WITH HER.

10:37.567 --> 10:38.900
YES, THANK YOU, SHAWN.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.600
AND SHE WAS CATTING AROUND
WITH THAT GOOD-LOOKING
ART GUY.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.800
YEAH, OK.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.500
AND WHEN I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THIS ON THE WAY OVER,

10:44.500 --> 10:47.600
I REALIZED, YEAH,
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY
MAY NOT BELONG TOGETHER.

10:47.600 --> 10:52.200
I MEAN, THE HEARTLESS
CRUELTY YOU INFLICTED
ON EACH OTHER,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.400
WHO DOES THAT
TO EACH OTHER?

10:53.400 --> 10:59.233
NO. NO. THERE JUST MAY BE
TOO MUCH DAMAGE DONE.

10:59.233 --> 11:02.400
FORTUNATELY,
I KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELVES,

11:02.400 --> 11:06.400
AND I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN,
IN YOUR SOULS,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.200
YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.133
YOU SURE?

11:10.133 --> 11:11.133
YEAH.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.000
THAT'S GOOD.
SO WE'RE DONE?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.934
NO. WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

11:14.934 --> 11:17.300
CORY, IF THERE WAS
ONE THING

11:17.300 --> 11:20.100
THAT YOU COULD
CHANGE ABOUT TOPANGA,

11:20.100 --> 11:22.767
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

11:22.767 --> 11:25.100
I--I--I WOULDN'T
CHANGE A THING.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.133
OH, WORK WITH ME HERE.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.367
BE BRUTALLY HONEST.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.767
NAME ONE THING
THAT YOU WOULD CHANGE.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.000
DON'T THINK. FEEL!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.500
BUT I'M NOT SURE--

11:33.500 --> 11:34.600
Humor him.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.467
BUT I WOULDN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.700
COME ON, CORY.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.467
WE'VE BEEN BROKEN UP
FOR 53 DAYS.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.834
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND
A TEENSY BIT OF ANGER
AND RESENTMENT

11:41.834 --> 11:43.567
SOMEWHERE IN YOU
IF YOU DIG REAL DEEP

11:43.567 --> 11:46.300
AND THINK
ABOUT ALL THE PAIN
I'VE CAUSED YOU LATELY.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.400
IS THERE, CORY?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.667
IS THERE SOME ANGER
THAT THE 2 OF YOU

11:49.667 --> 11:51.700
STILL NEED
TO WORK OUT?

11:51.700 --> 11:56.467
I--I--YOU KNOW, I NEVER KNEW
YOU COULD BE SO COLD
AND UNFORGIVING.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.400
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

12:01.400 --> 12:02.400
TERRIBLE!

12:02.400 --> 12:03.867
Topanga, I was only--

12:03.867 --> 12:04.867
NO MORE SECRETS!

12:04.867 --> 12:07.967
BUT I WAS ONLY--
NO MORE HOSTILITY!

12:09.000 --> 12:10.900
NOW, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
TOPANGA?

12:10.900 --> 12:13.900
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
AN INSENSITIVE JERK YOU ARE!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.767
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:15.767 --> 12:18.100
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT, CORY?

12:18.100 --> 12:19.467
NOT GOOD.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.400
WHY WOULD YOU SAY I WAS
COLD AND UNFORGIVING?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.133
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMED LIKE
THE RIGHT THING

12:23.133 --> 12:25.133
FOR AN INSENSITIVE
JERK TO SAY.

12:25.133 --> 12:26.233
WELL, GOOD! OK!

12:26.233 --> 12:29.000
YOU SEE, WE'VE GOT
A DIALOGUE GOING NOW,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.400
AND WE'RE ON THE ROAD
TO RECONCILIATION,
RIGHT, GUYS?

12:32.400 --> 12:35.100
RIGHT? AREN'T WE
ON THAT ROAD?

12:35.100 --> 12:37.000
MAYBE AN ACCESS ROAD?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.967
WE EVEN IN THE CAR?

12:38.967 --> 12:40.934
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M COLD
AND UNFORGIVING,

12:40.934 --> 12:42.500
SO I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW I THOUGHT

12:42.500 --> 12:44.200
WE COULD'VE GOTTEN
BACK TOGETHER.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.600
SHE REALLY LEFT!

12:46.600 --> 12:48.867
I TOLD YOU, THIS IS
GOING TO BE TOUGH.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.734
WHAT?

12:56.567 --> 12:57.600
WELL, MAYBE WE'RE JUST
GOING TO HAVE

12:57.600 --> 12:59.000
TO ACCEPT THE FACT

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
THAT YOU AND TOPANGA
AREN'T GOING TO GET
BACK TOGETHER.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.700
YOU BIG, STUPID IDIOT!

13:04.700 --> 13:06.300
THAT'S GREAT!
LET IT OUT.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.767
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.100
WE WERE BACK TOGETHER.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.500
WE JUST WANTED
TO MAKE YOU FEEL

13:10.500 --> 13:12.734
LIKE YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

13:12.734 --> 13:14.200
WHAT?

13:14.200 --> 13:18.600
YOU MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
NEED MY HELP REALLY?

13:18.600 --> 13:22.000
HEY, YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T FEEL BAD
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.667
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF STUPID THING WAS IT

13:23.667 --> 13:27.667
FOR YOU TO CARE
WHETHER I PUT YOU
BACK TOGETHER OR NOT?

13:27.667 --> 13:29.934
WHAT ARE YOU,
HUMPTY DUMPTY?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.233
NO, NO, NO, SHAWN.
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.767
WE TOLD FEENY FIRST, OK?

13:33.767 --> 13:35.500
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
VERY, VERY UPSET.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.734
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

13:36.734 --> 13:38.900
YOU TOLD FEENY
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME?

13:38.900 --> 13:40.133
YES.
WHO CARES?!

13:40.133 --> 13:43.033
THE MAIN THING IS
YOU'RE BACK TOGETHER!

13:43.033 --> 13:46.500
BUT WE'RE NOT NOW.
YOU JUST BROKE US
UP AGAIN.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.734
YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME THAT

13:47.734 --> 13:49.500
SO I CAN PUT YOU
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

13:49.500 --> 13:54.600
I DON'T LIKE
YOUR SICK GAMES,
CORY THE MIND BENDER.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.200
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN
MORE CLASSES

14:05.200 --> 14:06.400
DURING OUR SENIOR YEAR.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.867
WE HAVE ENTIRELY
WAY TOO MUCH TIME
ON OUR HANDS.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.567
OK. I'VE GATHERED
YOU ALL HERE TODAY

14:14.567 --> 14:16.100
TO ASK ONE QUESTION.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.467
BY A SHOW OF HANDS,

14:17.467 --> 14:20.934
HOW MANY OF US ARE SICK
OF THE CORY-TOPANGA
ISSUE?

14:23.500 --> 14:26.000
ERIC, YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE NOT
RAISING YOUR HAND.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
WHY IS THAT, ERIC?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.800
BECAUSE I'M THE EXTENSION.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.467
YOU MEAN EXCEPTION?

14:32.467 --> 14:34.700
WAS TODAY'S WORD EXCEPTION?

14:34.700 --> 14:37.800
NO, TODAY'S WORD
WAS PERTINENT,

14:37.800 --> 14:42.767
BUT I DIDN'T THAT WAS
HAVING ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS SITUATION.

14:42.767 --> 14:45.767
ALL RIGHT.
BY A SHOW OF HANDS,

14:45.767 --> 14:47.567
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE TIRED OF ERIC?

14:52.300 --> 14:55.567
COOL. IT'S UBIQUITOUS.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.233
LOOK, SHAWN, IT WAS
REALLY NICE OF YOU

15:00.233 --> 15:01.867
TO STAGE THIS LITTLE
INTERVENTION FOR US,

15:01.867 --> 15:05.367
BUT I REALLY THINK
CORY AND I CAN HANDLE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

15:05.367 --> 15:08.867
OR NON-RELATIONSHIP
OR WHATEVER IT WAS
OR IS OR MIGHT BE.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.967
I DON'T THINK SO, TOPANGA.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.200
YOU'VE HAD YOUR CHANCE.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.467
I'M TAKING
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

15:14.467 --> 15:17.567
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.133
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.834
THEN WHY DID
THEY BREAK UP?

15:20.834 --> 15:22.600
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE'S UPSET ABOUT?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.000
YOU CALLED ME COLD
AND UNFORGIVING.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
YOU USED TO THINK
I WAS PRETTY PERFECT!

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
YOU CALLED ME
AN INSENSITIVE JERK!

15:29.000 --> 15:31.300
YOU USED TO THINK I WAS
THE MOST CONSIDERATE GUY
IN THE WORLD.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.500
MAYBE WE'VE JUST KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR TOO LONG.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.700
MAYBE WE DON'T REALLY
BELONG TOGETHER ANYMORE.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.100
OR MAYBE
THERE'S JUST
SOME RESIDUAL ANGER

15:38.100 --> 15:39.500
KEEPING YOU APART.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.800
RESIDUAL! TO LEAVE OVER.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.934
LIKE IF YOUR MOM
MAKES A POT ROAST

15:42.934 --> 15:44.100
AND YOU DON'T FINISH IT,

15:44.100 --> 15:45.700
WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT OVER
IS THE RESIDUAL POT ROAST.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.233
RESIDUAL.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.600
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO LIVE
HERE, MAN. YOU DON'T.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.734
THEN WHY DO YOU STAY?

15:53.734 --> 15:54.900
BECAUSE...

15:54.900 --> 15:56.100
HE'S MY FRIEND.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.300
BECAUSE I LIKE HIM,

15:57.300 --> 16:01.300
AND NO MATTER
WHAT CRAZY THINGS
HE SAYS OR DOES,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.600
I STILL LIKE HIM.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.400
GOD HELP ME,
I STILL LIKE HIM.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.900
OH, HEY, COME HERE, MAN.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.767
COME HERE.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.367
OH, LOOK AT THEM.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.734
THEY'RE, LIKE,
A MILLION MILES APART.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.734
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.200
I DON'T THINK WE
EVER UNDERSTOOD

16:22.200 --> 16:23.667
HOW CLOSE
THEY ACTUALLY ARE.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.667
WHAT?

16:24.667 --> 16:26.300
COR, WE NEED YOU
TO BE BACK HOME

16:26.300 --> 16:29.000
WHEN MORGAN GETS BACK
FROM HER ART LESSON.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
HI, TOPANGA.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
HI.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.567
WHY, YOU GOT
A BIG EMERGENCY?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.967
YOUR MOTHER NEEDS ME
TO GO SHOPPING WITH HER

16:34.967 --> 16:36.000
FOR BATH TOWELS.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.400
SUDDENLY SHE CAN'T
BUY THEM WITHOUT ME.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.500
ALAN, I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF PICKING OUT TOWELS
BY MYSELF.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.767
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I DON'T PICK OUT SOMETHING

16:43.767 --> 16:45.133
TOO PINK OR TOO FLUFFY
THIS TIME.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.867
BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.133
JUST DON'T PUNISH ME
OVER TOWELS, OK?

16:49.133 --> 16:52.900
MAYBE THE PUNISHMENT
IS BECAUSE YOU FORGOT
MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.567
I DIDN'T FORGET.
I MADE A CHOICE.

16:55.567 --> 16:59.100
OH, THAT IS THE MOST
INSENSITIVE THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD!

16:59.100 --> 17:01.600
RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.900
[RASPBERRY]

17:02.900 --> 17:04.600
FINE. YOU KNOW,
LET'S JUST GET THIS
OVER WITH,

17:04.600 --> 17:05.834
SO I CAN GET BACK
FOR THE GAME.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.100
OH, THE PRECIOUS PHILLYS.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.100
I'M SURE THIS GAME
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE

17:10.100 --> 17:12.300
BETWEEN, WHAT,
FOURTH OR FIFTH PLACE?

17:12.300 --> 17:15.233
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY?

17:15.233 --> 17:17.200
I SAID THEY STINK!

17:17.200 --> 17:20.000
YOU WANT TO WATCH BASEBALL,
MOVE TO BALTIMORE.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.967
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

17:21.967 --> 17:23.834
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
I'M DRIVING.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.767
IT'S 5:00.
YOU'RE A LUNATIC
AT RUSH HOUR.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.367
MOM, COME ON.
WHEN YOU SAID LUNATIC--

17:28.367 --> 17:31.400
IT'S NOT THE TRAFFIC
THAT MAKES ME CRAZY,
DEAR.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.900
"OH, OH, LOOK OUT!
TURN RIGHT HERE, PLEASE.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.467
"OH, YOU'RE TOO CLOSE!

17:35.467 --> 17:36.467
YIELD!"

17:36.467 --> 17:38.033
AND IF I'M SUCH
A BAD DRIVER,

17:38.033 --> 17:39.700
WHY DID YOU MARRY ME?

17:39.700 --> 17:41.133
DAD, WHEN YOU SAY
WHY DID YOU MARRY ME--

17:41.133 --> 17:43.033
I WOULDN'T HAVE
IF I HAD LISTENED
TO MY MOTHER.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.500
MOM, DAD, PLEASE. LISTEN--

17:44.500 --> 17:46.834
YOU KNOW, I AM GLAD
THAT I FORGOT YOUR
MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY,

17:46.834 --> 17:49.033
AND WHEN JUNE 14th
ROLLS AROUND,

17:49.033 --> 17:52.500
I MIGHT FORGET
SOMEONE ELSE'S, TOO.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.100
OH, YOU THINK
IT'S FUNNY IF I FORGET
YOUR BIRTHDAY, HUH?

17:57.100 --> 17:59.400
THAT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.500
WHAT?

18:00.500 --> 18:02.767
AND I KNOW JUST WHAT
I'M GOING TO GET YOU,

18:02.767 --> 18:04.000
YOU BIG LUG.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO GET ME?
GIVE ME A HINT.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.133
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL.

18:07.133 --> 18:08.500
THEN IT WON'T BE
A SURPRISE.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.600
OH, I KNOW. YOU'RE GOING
TO GIVE ME BATH TOWELS.
RIGHT?

18:10.600 --> 18:13.100
WELL, MAYBE I'LL TELL YOU
IN THE CAR.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.500
OK. YOU WANT TO DRIVE?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.600
NO, YOU CAN DRIVE,

18:15.600 --> 18:17.934
BUT DON'T LISTEN
TO THE GAME ON THE RADIO,

18:17.934 --> 18:19.033
BECAUSE I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.033
ABOUT WHAT?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.100
ABOUT WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.834
ALL RIGHT,
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.700
COME ON, WHOA.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.567
YOU 2 JUST SAID
HORRIBLE THINGS
TO EACH OTHER

18:26.567 --> 18:27.734
AND THEN GOT
ALL LOVEY-DOVEY.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.100
HEY, I WAS GOING
TO SAY THAT!

18:30.100 --> 18:32.033
HOW COME YOU SAY THAT
WHEN I WAS GOING TO
SAY THAT?

18:32.033 --> 18:34.700
WHO CARES WHO SAYS IT
AS LONG AS IT GETS SAID?

18:34.700 --> 18:37.300
THEN WHAT ARE WE
ARGUING ABOUT?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.600
WE SOUND LIKE THEM.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.033
OH, NO. WE DO.

18:42.033 --> 18:45.100
WHY--WHY DO WE
SOUND LIKE YOU?

18:45.100 --> 18:46.800
BECAUSE YOU
LOVE EACH OTHER.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.667
NO MATTER WHAT
CRAZY THINGS HE
SAYS OR DOES,

18:50.667 --> 18:54.100
YOU STILL
LOVE EACH OTHER.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.200
THEN WHY DID WE BREAK UP?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.066
BECAUSE WE'RE
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

19:00.066 --> 19:02.300
AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.033
BUT WHEN 2 PEOPLE
ARE REALLY IN LOVE,

19:07.033 --> 19:10.000
IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT
THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS
SOMETIMES.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
IT COMES
WITH THE TERRITORY.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.867
AND WHEN 2 PEOPLE
ARE REALLY IN LOVE,

19:12.867 --> 19:15.767
THEY DON'T BREAK UP
JUST 'CAUSE THEY HAVE
A FIGHT.

19:15.767 --> 19:18.567
LOVE WOULD BE PRETTY DULL
IF YOU AGREED ABOUT
EVERYTHING.

19:18.567 --> 19:21.800
BESIDES, THEN THEY'D
NEVER GET TO MAKE UP.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.834
WHEN 2 PEOPLE
ARE IN LOVE,

19:25.834 --> 19:28.233
THEY DON'T BREAK UP
JUST BECAUSE THEY FIGHT.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.200
WANT TO MAKE UP NOW?

19:35.100 --> 19:38.300
NOW, THAT WAS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.300
THANK YOU.

19:39.300 --> 19:43.767
WHAT, LIKE YOU HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.400
SHAWN?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.800
SHAWN, CORY AND I
ARE BACK TOGETHER NOW.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.600
WE WANTED YOU TO BE
THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.400
HEY, CORY AND TOPANGA
ARE BACK TOGETHER.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.500
THEY ARE?

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
YEAH,

19:54.500 --> 19:55.667
AND, LISTEN, SHAWN,

19:55.667 --> 19:57.967
I'M SORRY WE EVER PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU

19:57.967 --> 19:59.400
TO GET US BACK TOGETHER.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
MY BEST FRIEND,

20:02.400 --> 20:05.233
NO ONE COULD EVER DO THAT.

20:05.233 --> 20:07.734
I GUESS FRIENDSHIP
ONLY GOES SO FAR.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
MORNING, BOYS.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.233
SALUTATIONS,
MY DIDACTIC FRIEND.

20:29.967 --> 20:30.967
EXCUSE ME?

20:30.967 --> 20:32.800
HI. HE SAID HI.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.834
DOES HE KNOW
WHAT HE SAID?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.300
HA HA HA HA!
OH, MR. FEENY,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.900
I APPRECIATE YOUR
SARDONIC JOCULARITY.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.400
IT'S HIS WORD-A-DAY
CALENDAR.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.667
IT TOOK HIM SOME TIME,
BUT HE'S FINALLY
GOT IT DOWN.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.800
OH, WELL, ERIC,
I SALUTE YOU.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.600
A GOOD VOCABULARY
IS AN IMPORTANT
ASSET IN LIFE.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.200
WELL, THANK YOU,
MR. FEENY.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.867
I'M CERTAIN MY
ERUDITE LOQUACIOUSNESS

20:53.867 --> 20:57.200
WILL BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS,
PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS
INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSE.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.300
I CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS
GOING TO GET OLD QUICK.

21:01.300 --> 21:05.133
CAN YOU?
SNAP HIM OUT OF IT.

21:05.133 --> 21:08.967
SO, ERIC, HAVE YOU
PERUSED THE TASTEFULLY
LASCIVIOUS

21:08.967 --> 21:11.900

<i>SWIMSUIT ISSUE? </i>

21:11.900 --> 21:13.600
TUSHIES FOR SALE!

21:13.600 --> 21:15.567
COOL!

21:22.967 --> 21:24.600
YOU'RE A GOOD TEACHER,
MR. FEENY.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.133
YEAH, WELL, WHEN YOU
LIVE NEXT DOOR

21:27.133 --> 21:29.600
TO A HOUSE
FULL OF PSYCHOS...
