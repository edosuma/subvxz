00:14.915 --> 00:19.261
It all began here, at 33 Addicott Road,
in Weston-super-Mare,

00:19.261 --> 00:19.353
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:19.353 --> 00:22.000
in 1945, when Ritchie Blackmore was born.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:22.000 --> 00:22.857
in 1945, when Ritchie Blackmore was born.

00:28.996 --> 00:32.273
He would go on not only
to write one of rock's most famous riffs,

00:32.366 --> 00:35.438
but to explore a number of
musical forms including Bach,

00:35.569 --> 00:39.847
classical symphonic rock, hard rock,
blues and medieval ballads.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.717
Ritchie was interested in the guitar
from an early age

00:46.780 --> 00:49.886
but his father insisted
he took proper lessons.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.197
My father insisted I went to music lessons
when I was eleven.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.259
He said to me at the time,

00:59.359 --> 01:03.637
"if you don't learn this properly,
I'm gonna put it across your head."

01:03.730 --> 01:07.769
I used to cycle about four miles
to the guy who was teaching me.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.610
And I'd often fall off my bike.

01:26.286 --> 01:29.563
Throughout his life, Ritchie has been
the object of much criticism,

01:29.656 --> 01:31.602
adulation and speculation.

01:31.658 --> 01:35.572
But until now, he has never given the world
his take on his story.

01:35.662 --> 01:41.271
A story with more than its fair share
of tantrums, break-ups, rivalry and rouse.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.578
He was such an advanced musician,
way ahead of his time,

01:44.671 --> 01:45.843
way, way ahead.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.954
He's a fire ball, you know,
he really is beyond belief.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.013
His technique is incredible.
Where did that come from? I have no idea.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.154
And this is before Hendrix.

01:59.252 --> 02:05.533
Ritchie really is a great originator
and creator of the wild electric guitar.

02:13.033 --> 02:17.539
The way he holds the guitar and everything,
it's sort of ingrained in my mind

02:17.671 --> 02:20.049
as that's what a cool guitar player
is supposed to look like,

02:20.173 --> 02:21.709
that's how they are supposed to behave.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.984
In a lot of ways,
ifs a little tragic that Ritchie didn't stand up

02:26.046 --> 02:30.153
and shine the light on himself.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.561
Which is why I'm happy to be here.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.657
He needs the light right on him,

02:35.722 --> 02:39.067
because unlike many people
he actually deserves it.

02:49.670 --> 02:54.244
It's like a sword'
almost like a clean sharp sword,

02:54.341 --> 02:57.254
that weighs a real lot, you know.

02:58.378 --> 03:02.053
His precision when he plays was stunning.

03:02.249 --> 03:07.858
A true pioneer as somebody who was
truly unique and original.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.341
To me he was like the Caucasian Hendrix.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.440
It actually changed my life.
It was my first gig ever.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.745
We got right up against the stage,
right in front of Ritchie.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.913
He came out and Purple came out
and he just blew me away.

03:31.011 --> 03:35.756
It was way more than I expected,
it was just a lot.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.192
After that I was dazed,

03:37.284 --> 03:40.731
I went home to my mum and dad and said,
"I need a guitar, I have to have a guitar."

03:51.598 --> 03:53.976
He is measured, he is thoughtful.

03:54.101 --> 03:59.983
He knows the value of clear space,
of daylight between the notes.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.077
It's not all about...

04:03.143 --> 04:06.420
It's about phrasing, it's about time.
It's about...

04:06.480 --> 04:09.757
The spaces are as important
as the notes that they separate.

04:18.759 --> 04:22.172
It's a mystery. I still find Ritchie Blackmore
a complete mystery.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.502
It's also a mystery
that people don't talk about him that much.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.443
It's odd because he's absolutely there
<i>as</i> one of the pioneers.

04:28.835 --> 04:32.510
The pioneering Ritchie was single-minded
from an early age.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.013
I won't do what I'm told to do.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.181
That seemed to go back to when I was five.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.853
I've seen pictures of me at five,

04:40.981 --> 04:44.428
and I remember distinctively, my mother
saying, "Smile for the cameraman."

04:44.518 --> 04:46.361
And I'm going, "No",

04:46.486 --> 04:48.693
and I felt resentment to the cameraman.

04:48.989 --> 04:49.990
Why do you need...

04:50.090 --> 04:53.094
And I used to say to my mother,
"Why do you need a picture of me?"

04:53.193 --> 04:58.006
She goes, "Because to remember you,
you're five."

04:58.098 --> 05:01.102
"Well, I'm here now."
And I couldn't understand the principle.

05:01.868 --> 05:05.145
There's something in there psychologically.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.778
Why was I so uptight at the age of five?

05:10.377 --> 05:12.220
But before he was in his teens,

05:12.312 --> 05:16.522
Ritchie made a promise to himself to be
the best there was, whatever it took.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.727
I was such a poor pupil

05:18.819 --> 05:23.734
and I was always near the bottom
of the class, in my tests.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.393
I thought, "You know what I'm gonna do?

05:25.525 --> 05:29.371
"I'm going to excel in music, on the guitar."

05:29.462 --> 05:34.571
So they go, "Well, he was a terrible pupil,
but he was a really good guitar player."

05:34.668 --> 05:39.344
And I had that thought in my head,
ever since I was 12, onwards.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.911
Well, he doesn't know anything,
but he can really play the guitar.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.014
And I always wanted the teachers to say that.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.766
From the age of eighteen,
Ritchie worked for producer Joe Meek,

05:55.889 --> 06:00.201
as a sessions musician in London
and toured with Screaming Lord Sutch.

06:04.264 --> 06:07.438
And later with Gene Vincent
and Jerry Lee Lewis

06:07.567 --> 06:09.843
until the gigs dried up in 1968.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.251
I was working in a dry cleaners,

06:13.340 --> 06:17.550
I had about sixteen telegrams
from Chris Curtis,

06:17.611 --> 06:21.787
who was in the band The Searchers,
who I had met in Hamburg.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.954
And he really liked my playing,

06:25.085 --> 06:29.431
and he said, "I have a backer,
I want you to come to England,

06:29.522 --> 06:34.437
"I'm gonna start a band,
you're gonna play second guitar."

06:35.295 --> 06:37.605
Okay, who's playing first guitar?

06:37.697 --> 06:40.143
"I am", Chris Curtis.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.143
Okay, good.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.408
Who's playing drums then?
'Cause he's a drummer.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.815
He said, "I'm playing drums."

06:47.374 --> 06:50.253
Bass? He goes, "I'm bass player."

06:51.144 --> 06:53.954
"Yeah, I kind of thought
that was gonna happen."

06:54.080 --> 06:55.889
I said, "ls there anybody else in this band?"

06:55.982 --> 06:58.553
He said, "We have a keyboard player,
Jon Lord.“

06:59.486 --> 07:03.332
It was the start of a partnership
that would last for 25 years.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.269
We played together for a little bit,
and I realised how good he was.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.431
And it was mutual.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.774
I said, "I can get a brilliant drummer."

07:10.830 --> 07:15.336
Jon said, "I know a really good bass player."
It was Nick Simper.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.574
And so we just needed a singer.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.583
They took on Rod Evans <i>as</i> vocalist.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.747
And Chris Curtis soon dropped out
to be replaced by Ian Paice on drums.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.450
All they needed now was a name.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.622
Jon put in Orpheus.

07:31.685 --> 07:35.292
The drummer put in The Hill.
And I put in Deep Purple.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.459
Just 'cause of the song Deep Purple,

07:37.524 --> 07:40.801
my grandmother used to play it on the piano.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.862
And they seemed to like that.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.376
In those days you have to have
a double-barrel name.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.815
Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.882
It was a name that would become
synonymous with British hard rock,

07:55.976 --> 07:58.980
and launched the career
of Ritchie Blackmore.

08:07.554 --> 08:13.061
We did the usual,
going away to a cottage in the country.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.537
Which was the in thing to do at the time.

08:15.628 --> 08:19.804
Proverbial cottage, we were practising.

08:19.899 --> 08:24.006
Thief's hole, I think it was called.
And it was haunted. It had to be haunted.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.383
And we made that record,
the first one in 24 hours.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.750
We did it in two days. The whole thing.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.823
And while it wasn't an amazing record
in its own right,

08:32.912 --> 08:36.018
you do get struck by the fact
that there are times on the record

08:36.082 --> 08:38.722
when Ritchie Blackmore's
guitar performances

08:38.818 --> 08:41.230
were different to anything else.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.924
They weren't a copy of Hendrix.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.161
Even though you could hear
little bits of notations

08:45.258 --> 08:48.000
that maybe led towards Hendrix.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.005
They weren't a copy of anybody else.

08:50.096 --> 08:54.408
They were influenced by,
yet taking its own direction.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.880
He had a classical feel, the rock feel
and a rock and roll feel.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.097
Some tracks also had a distinctly pop feel.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.196
And it was a cover
of a Joe South song, Hush,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.138
which launched the band in the U.S.A.

09:33.606 --> 09:37.110
Back in England,
Ritchie heard Robert Plant singing.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.924
There was a place called Mothers
in Birmingham,

09:39.979 --> 09:44.121
Robert started singing and I'm going,
"My God, who's this? This amazing singer."

09:44.217 --> 09:48.222
He had the range, the voice and the look.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.824
That's when I decided
we have to get someone

09:50.924 --> 09:54.064
who can belt it out and project

09:54.727 --> 09:56.832
That when we got Ian Gillan.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.406
As soon as I heard him scream,
I went, "That's the guy for us.“

10:00.500 --> 10:05.415
He looked like Jim Morrison,
which I knew that would go down well.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.252
So we have someone
who looks like Jim Morrison

10:08.341 --> 10:11.083
and who can scream like Arthur Brown
and Edgar Winter.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.754
That scream was his identity.

10:30.763 --> 10:35.178
In came Ian Gillan and his scream
and new bassist Roger Glover.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.270
And out went Evans and Simper.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.815
Ritchie was now lead guitar

10:38.872 --> 10:41.876
in what was to become
the classic Deep Purple line-up.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.949
It became, I suppose,

10:46.045 --> 10:51.188
obvious to all of us that they were
not just another flash-in-the-pan

10:51.284 --> 10:54.197
pop rock band,
but there was something more of substance.

10:54.554 --> 10:58.331
And Ritchie was a figure of mystery
and wonder already, you know.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.234
Ritchie Blackmore was something incredible.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.306
I mean, nobody could play like
that in those days.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.589
No, it's not just speed, you know,

11:24.717 --> 11:28.096
there are a lot of people who can play fast,
you know, now.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.098
But they can't be Ritchie Blackmore.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.759
He plays right on the money

11:31.891 --> 11:34.770
and leaves enough space
to allow the music to breathe

11:34.861 --> 11:37.603
and the listener to become enveloped in

11:37.697 --> 11:41.839
the whole atmosphere of what's being
performed and created and generated.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.743
I went through a period of shredding

11:44.837 --> 11:47.784
and thinking that everything revolved
around speed.

11:47.907 --> 11:51.719
And now I go, "That really
doesn't mean anything."

11:51.778 --> 11:56.955
It's good to be fast now and again,
but you have to say something thoughtful.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.122
You can't just go, look at me...

12:00.220 --> 12:01.198
Am I not great?

12:01.287 --> 12:04.291
Ritchie will lake you on a couple of hours'
journey of guitar playing,

12:04.390 --> 12:06.700
which will cover a lot more ground.

12:06.793 --> 12:10.935
It's not just like tipping a pot
of multi-coloured paint over somebody,

12:11.030 --> 12:15.604
this is about drawing people into your
dark mysterious web.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.987
But while Ritchie was keen
to develop Deep Purple as a rock band,

12:27.113 --> 12:29.992
his co-founder Jon Lord
had other ambitions.

12:30.717 --> 12:34.790
Jon Lord was inspired to write
a concerto for group and orchestra,

12:34.887 --> 12:36.992
and it was a big challenging venture.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.502
The band Nice had previously
recorded with orchestras

12:40.593 --> 12:44.405
and had classical aspirations.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.309
But Jon Lord wanted to write a really sort of
important piece that would

12:48.401 --> 12:52.747
include the group with an orchestra
in a kind of artistic way,

12:52.839 --> 12:55.012
a way that would work effectively.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.485
And they tried it out at the Royal Albert Hall.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.423
And it was a big success, a big challenge.

13:22.869 --> 13:26.180
You can see Ritchie in the video
for the Albert Hall concert,

13:26.272 --> 13:29.719
and he plays great,
but you could feel he's very constrained.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.288
He's sort of itching to break out somewhere.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.721
He has this edge to him,

13:33.846 --> 13:36.725
which is indefinable and not quite tameable.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.888
The first record we did,
I thought was not bad.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.062
The two after that

13:43.456 --> 13:45.959
were lacking in direction.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.339
We were going in the studio
with, really, no ideas,

13:49.395 --> 13:52.239
'cause we were on the road all the time.

13:52.365 --> 13:57.872
It wasn't until we did the concerto
with Jon and the orchestra,

13:57.970 --> 14:01.679
and I said to them, "I really don't want
to play with orchestras any more.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.347
"Let's do a rock and roll record."

14:04.877 --> 14:08.518
I said, "Jon, we'll do the whole thing
as a rock and roll record,

14:08.581 --> 14:12.222
"and if it doesn't work, we'll play with
orchestras for the rest of our lives."

14:12.318 --> 14:13.592
So he said, "Yeah, that's sounds fair."

14:13.720 --> 14:17.065
We had Zeppelin starting Black Sabbath.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.033
Everybody was hitting with hard rock.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.230
Gave me an idea to play the hard rock stuff.

14:22.328 --> 14:26.276
I was going through kind of a angry, uptight,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.279
"Come on, let's get on with it."

14:29.402 --> 14:34.044
I'd had enough of playing with orchestras
and everything being wishy-washy.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.088
The wishy-washy orchestra
versus hard rock debate

14:37.176 --> 14:40.055
was resolved when the band wrote
and recorded Black Night.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.117
And it went to number two in the UK charts.

14:43.282 --> 14:47.924
We were in the studio
doing Deep Purple in Rock

14:48.020 --> 14:50.125
and the management came in.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.303
Amazing, you know, these people that go,

14:55.428 --> 14:58.432
"You know, what you need is a hit record."

14:58.531 --> 15:02.809
And you go, "I never thought of that.
A hit record, yeah."

15:02.969 --> 15:05.313
And I started playing.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.313
I just started playing.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.817
Okay, let's have a verse.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.260
Put a verse in there.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.936
And we did that very quickly.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.099
Very quickly.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.006
And all of a sudden,
of course that went to number one

15:32.098 --> 15:34.009
or number two, number one.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.307
It was funny how it was written like that,
very quickly,

15:37.403 --> 15:39.440
and that's the best way to write a song.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.682
And that is based on...

15:55.655 --> 16:00.263
Ricky Nelson put out a tune
called Summertime in 1958.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.675
Which, he's singing, "Summertime..."

16:08.801 --> 16:11.042
"...and the living is easy."

16:11.304 --> 16:14.478
That was the base riff, the top line was...

16:19.645 --> 16:21.283
Right? Adds that.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.825
So right there you got two hit records.
'Cause if you go...

16:42.502 --> 16:43.981
"Hey Joe..."

16:45.471 --> 16:49.544
As soon <i>as</i> I heard Hendrix play that intro,

16:51.978 --> 16:55.892
I thought' "He got that from the same record
that we got the base riff from."

17:23.776 --> 17:25.221
The band were on a roll.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.782
And in 1970,
their fourth album Deep Purple in Rock

17:28.881 --> 17:33.591
reached number four in the UK charts
and went gold in Britain and America.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.860
I just knew I was happy with it at the time,

17:36.956 --> 17:38.799
because the previous three,

17:38.891 --> 17:41.201
I thought,
"We don't know where we're going.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.900
"We're dilly-dallying,
we're going all over the place."

17:43.963 --> 17:48.935
Ballads, a bit of blues, folk,
it was like mishmash.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.642
People like to get a record and put it on,

17:52.772 --> 17:55.912
and go, "I can leave that on
and it's party time."

17:55.975 --> 17:59.582
The Deep Purple in Rock, of course,
was the definitive album,

17:59.645 --> 18:02.091
I think, for Deep Purple.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.254
It was the era of Black Sabbath, of course,
and Led Zeppelin.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.891
Soto see Deep Purple really focusing,

18:08.988 --> 18:12.401
get down to it on their rock album

18:12.491 --> 18:15.563
that really convinced
the vast <i>mass</i> of their fans.

18:15.661 --> 18:22.078
And really for the first time Deep Purple
became among the top three British bands.

18:22.168 --> 18:26.116
I think what really inspired me more than
anything else was the In Rock album.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.846
But it was the fire and it was the passion
that really spoke.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.148
That was the bit I wanted to bottle and keep.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.652
When you hear Speed King,

18:32.745 --> 18:35.954
you're looking at, really,
proto thrash, proto metal.

18:36.015 --> 18:40.794
This was so influential
in what came later in metal terms,

18:40.853 --> 18:45.461
and was really Blackmore delivering
a dynamic riff

18:45.524 --> 18:50.371
on which Gillan held his vocals
and which Lord played off with keyboard.

19:05.211 --> 19:10.183
And Child in Time is just phenomenal,
it's a remarkable piece of epic music.

19:10.282 --> 19:15.960
It's a story. It's almost biblical in the way
it reaches out and envelops you.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.126
This was a classical piece of music.

19:18.224 --> 19:21.797
This was a performance
by a band on an orchestral level.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.267
With the pressure on to follow up
the success of Deep Purple in Rock,

19:52.358 --> 19:53.598
Ritchie and the band once again

19:53.693 --> 19:56.173
locked themselves away from the world
to write.

19:56.262 --> 20:00.836
We rented this old dilapidated house
down in Devon.

20:02.234 --> 20:05.010
And everybody had their bedroom.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.177
And mine was full of flies,
and it was a dreadful place,

20:09.275 --> 20:11.778
but it had a good vibe to it or two.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.790
We were into doing lots of séances
at the time.

20:14.880 --> 20:21.627
And I always felt that to do a séance,
the best thing was to have a cross.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.862
It was in the early days when I kind of
believed in that,

20:25.958 --> 20:30.532
and that was kind of a...
As a form of protection.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.808
Of course I didn't have a cross on me.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.307
And I went up to Jon Lord's wife and said,

20:38.404 --> 20:42.113
"Do you have cross I could borrow?"
She said, "I'm Jewish."

20:42.208 --> 20:44.484
That didn't go down too well.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.146
So I went, "Roger! Roger will have a cross."

20:47.246 --> 20:50.750
And I went to his bedroom outside,
he'd gone to sleep.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.054
"Roger?" "What?"

20:53.152 --> 20:54.722
"Do you have a cross?" "Yeah."

20:54.820 --> 20:56.390
"I need the cross, we're doing a séance."

20:56.722 --> 20:58.565
"No, leave me alone."

20:58.824 --> 21:00.963
So, I got this axe,

21:01.060 --> 21:05.065
so I went crash crash at the door

21:05.164 --> 21:09.613
and made a hole,
and I'm axing the door down.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.677
I pulled it and I got through the hole
and went over to him.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.980
"I want your cross." "Go on, get off, get off."

21:17.076 --> 21:20.421
Roger is a very gentle man.

21:20.513 --> 21:24.825
Violence doesn't often occur to him
<i>as</i> a means to anything.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.089
It <i>was</i> very un-Roger like,

21:26.185 --> 21:32.033
what followed, Roger chasing Ritchie
around the house with said axe.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.163
You know, I said, "Roger, wow."

21:35.261 --> 21:36.467
So that was a lot of fun.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.684
In 1971 they released a new single,
Strange Kind of Woman

21:48.774 --> 21:53.348
and a follow-up to their landmark
Deep Purple in Rock, the album Fireball.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.057
It <i>was</i> great because,

21:57.183 --> 22:01.996
all of a sudden,
starving for a few years before that,

22:02.054 --> 22:04.000
and we were suddenly in vogue

22:04.056 --> 22:08.163
and everybody had Deep Purple in Rock
until we replaced it with Fireball.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.867
Fireball was put together loo quickly,

22:11.831 --> 22:15.074
for my liking, we didn't have the ideas.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.148
Fireball to me was artificial, contrived.

22:19.905 --> 22:21.578
Despite Ritchie's misgivings,

22:21.674 --> 22:24.086
Fireball reached number one
on the UK charts,

22:24.210 --> 22:27.419
and the band set to work on
what would be their third album,

22:27.513 --> 22:28.719
Machine Head.

22:29.815 --> 22:33.058
Machine Head, I have great memories of,
we did that in the Swiss Alps,

22:33.152 --> 22:34.654
and that was fantastic.

22:34.753 --> 22:38.394
And we did it in three weeks
and the ideas were just flowing.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.061
I had written a few things in my time off,
so I had those,

22:42.161 --> 22:45.233
like Highway Star.

22:46.432 --> 22:49.777
I had written the solo basically at home,
worked it out,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.678
which I had never done before.

22:51.770 --> 22:55.684
It was always on the fly,
you know, just jamming.

22:55.774 --> 22:59.620
But, so we had a lot of constructive ideas.

22:59.745 --> 23:04.216
Roger Glover had written Maybe I'm a Leo,
which I thought was a great tune.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.124
They were due 10 record in the casino,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.722
which was then the main concert venue
in Montreux.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.290
But the evening before
they were due to start,

23:11.390 --> 23:15.361
a fire ignited during a Frank Zappa concert,
burning it to the ground.

23:19.565 --> 23:23.206
Festival organizer Claude Nobs
came to their rescue.

23:23.802 --> 23:27.045
Claude with enormous selflessness said,

23:27.139 --> 23:30.985
"Don't worry, I'll help you to find
somewhere else to record."

23:31.911 --> 23:33.117
Where? Anyway.

23:33.212 --> 23:39.561
So, there was this amazing
Victorian glass-walled pavilion

23:40.386 --> 23:43.492
in some gardens,
some lovely lakeside gardens.

23:44.089 --> 23:49.767
And with enormous disregard for anyone
who might live within 10 or 12 miles of it,

23:49.828 --> 23:52.832
we set up in there, you know.

23:54.333 --> 23:59.442
And it was a very ill-chosen place,

23:59.505 --> 24:01.746
but it was a stopgap.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.016
The recording session was back on track.

24:05.577 --> 24:11.084
Ritchie was astonishingly prolific
with guitar riffs.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.184
Profligate almost, you know?

24:12.284 --> 24:13.957
They would just tumble out of him.

24:14.019 --> 24:18.832
And that was heaven,
absolute heaven for a band,

24:18.924 --> 24:24.306
because here was a guitarist who just would
never tread, it seemed, the same road twice.

24:24.496 --> 24:27.943
And it was the fire that had destroyed
their original recording venue

24:28.033 --> 24:31.879
that was to inspire the song that contains
one of rock's greatest riffs.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.379
When we got back to the hotel, there was a...

24:35.474 --> 24:38.216
We looked out of the window,
I think we all had stiff brandies or something.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.722
We looked out of the window
and you could actually see the smoke

24:40.813 --> 24:42.952
from the casino coming across the lake.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.187
This big, billowing cloud
coming across the lake,

24:45.284 --> 24:48.322
hence the title Smoke on the Water,
the boys came up with that.

24:48.387 --> 24:52.392
The first time I heard Smoke on the Water,
of course, from Machine Head,

24:52.491 --> 24:55.370
it was one of those riffs
that hit you right away.

24:55.461 --> 24:58.908
It's a bit like Sunshine of Your Love
by Cream,

24:58.998 --> 25:01.137
or Whole Lotta Love by Led Zeppelin.

25:01.233 --> 25:05.045
It was just... I don't know where guitarists
find these riffs from, actually.

25:05.137 --> 25:08.914
When we did Smoke on the Water,

25:09.008 --> 25:11.921
it was just Ian and myself, Paice and myself.

25:12.077 --> 25:15.217
I said, "What rhythm haven't we played?"
and he went...

25:16.348 --> 25:18.919
He laid that down, so I just went...

25:21.687 --> 25:26.602
That's where we were and the next minute,

25:26.725 --> 25:30.229
the police were knocking at the door
'cause we were making so much racket.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.070
And we knew it was the police,

25:33.165 --> 25:37.773
so we said, "Let's go for a take
before they throw us out of here."

25:39.271 --> 25:43.686
Every guitar player
dreams of doing with its creators.

25:43.776 --> 25:47.189
Every kid who ever picked up a guitar
can do...

25:47.780 --> 25:49.782
Funny thing is, they all do it different.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.794
That's the nice thing, and I found that l had it
in my head how to play it,

25:52.918 --> 25:55.797
and it was completely different to the way
Ritchie plays it.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.560
Somebody said that music

26:00.192 --> 26:06.302
is many different colours and one of those
colours is silence, simplicity.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.744
The quiet pans, the easy parts,
the parts you can immediately grasp on to

26:10.803 --> 26:13.147
and wonder why you didn't write it yourself.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.651
That's genius.
That's a genius riff. Wish I'd wrote it.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.844
The second record that I ever bought
in my life was Machine Head.

26:41.967 --> 26:44.174
What an album. Oh, my God!

26:44.269 --> 26:49.309
To have a record like that
and to have a guitar player like Ritchie

26:49.408 --> 26:54.858
in your radar and your field,
it was just the greatest.

26:54.980 --> 26:58.484
You just think, "What would my life have
been like without that?"

27:27.880 --> 27:32.158
It's the way Ritchie plays the riff.
It's not the way that

27:32.217 --> 27:36.529
two generations of kids have played it
in the guitar shop and driven people mad,

27:36.622 --> 27:38.158
to the point where in some shops in London

27:38.223 --> 27:42.194
it says, "If you are trying out a guitar please
don't play Smoke on the Water."

27:42.294 --> 27:45.639
The first guitar, that guitar, right over there.

27:45.731 --> 27:48.974
You see the Strat with the maple body,

27:49.067 --> 27:51.707
that was my first real guitar.

27:51.803 --> 27:57.583
And I got it because of the poster on my wall
in my bedroom of Ritchie playing.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.553
It was that guitar.

27:59.645 --> 28:02.854
And that's what I wanted.
I wanted the Ritchie Blackmore Strat.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.869
Ritchie's solo on
Machine Head's Highway Star

28:17.930 --> 28:20.911
was also set to become
a Deep Purple statement.

28:21.233 --> 28:26.512
Highway Star is... That's crazy.
That's just a crazy song for a guitar player.

28:26.605 --> 28:30.052
It makes everyone who thinks they are
a guitar player need to pick up their guitar

28:30.108 --> 28:33.920
and see,
"Well, if I'm that good, can I do that?"

28:34.613 --> 28:39.119
Highway Star solo was one of the first
things I could get my head around.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.290
Even when I was like 16 or 17,

28:42.421 --> 28:46.028
it wasn't the standard notes you'd use.
It wasn't just the blues scale.

28:46.124 --> 28:52.200
It was classically... There was classical stuff
coming in there and with this aggression.

28:52.297 --> 28:55.574
Ritchie was really looking to expand
on his solos

28:55.634 --> 28:57.636
and wanted a particular sequence,

28:57.769 --> 28:59.612
which is actually
almost a classical sequence.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.982
It's probably the defining moment

29:03.108 --> 29:08.615
for Ritchie's soloing, Highway Star to me.
It's the most recognizable solo.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.320
I like solos where you know them,

29:11.450 --> 29:14.329
solos where it's just a.” Nothing.

29:14.820 --> 29:19.098
So I think Highway Star was just stunning
for that effect.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.678
I always thought American players always go
right to the edge of the cliff and fall off

30:03.769 --> 30:06.215
and wave as they are going down.

30:06.338 --> 30:11.378
But the British players seem to take
that one half a step back from the cliff

30:11.510 --> 30:14.980
and so it's together
right till the end of the song,

30:15.047 --> 30:17.550
but it's still extremely thrilling.

30:17.649 --> 30:22.689
And funny thing about that song is that,

30:22.788 --> 30:26.668
having played it, you can get carried away
with the emotion of the song,

30:26.725 --> 30:27.999
the intensity of it,

30:28.060 --> 30:31.564
of what you're doing, and it ruins it in a way.

30:31.663 --> 30:37.511
And that's part of Ritchie's charm for me
is his restraint at the right moments,

30:37.569 --> 30:40.846
and it creates a lot of drama in his parts.

30:40.906 --> 30:41.907
It was a game changer,

30:42.007 --> 30:43.884
I thought Machine Head
was a game changer myself.

30:44.409 --> 30:48.084
Machine Head reached number seven
and went double platinum in the USA

30:48.213 --> 30:50.693
and gold at number one in the UK.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.923
But Ritchie's desire to control events
was now leading to clashes

30:54.019 --> 30:56.021
with vocalist Ian Gillan.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.593
He was, as they say, an alpha guy. So was I.

31:00.726 --> 31:05.607
He wanted to control, I wanted to control,
so we butted heads because of that.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.574
We still respected each other,
but we never got on.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.944
And we just couldn't be in the same room.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.105
That was the problem.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.186
I wasn't speaking to him,
he wasn't speaking to me.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.513
We weren't being creative.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.188
The band then toured Japan

31:21.279 --> 31:26.888
which produced their hugely successful
1972 live album, Made in Japan.

31:26.952 --> 31:30.229
Things were coming to a head
with Ian Gillan.

31:30.288 --> 31:34.532
I think it started with coming back
on the Japanese flight.

31:36.027 --> 31:40.772
Paul Rodgers' you know,
to me was just mind-blowing, his voice.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.141
I wanted Ian to be able to do that,

31:44.269 --> 31:47.807
and I couldn't relate lo lan's
screaming and yelling

31:47.906 --> 31:50.113
and the Elvis Presley impersonation.

31:51.276 --> 31:55.452
He said, "So, how do you want me to sing?
I'll sing any way you want me to sing".

31:55.547 --> 32:02.089
And I went, "Ian, you can't sing that way,
that's a blues thing", you know?

32:03.288 --> 32:06.667
I think after that, that turned him off.

32:07.125 --> 32:10.334
He was rejected,
so we went downhill from there.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.674
The aptly titled Who Do We Think We Are

32:20.806 --> 32:25.016
was lo be the final album before
Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left the band.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.984
I think Ritchie Blackmore spent a lot of
his career looking for the perfect line-up.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.494
And when he found it,
he still wasn't happy with it.

32:33.685 --> 32:34.857
We started looking for other people,

32:34.986 --> 32:37.830
we found Glenn Hughes
and David Coverdale.

32:37.923 --> 32:38.924
I'd left art college,

32:39.024 --> 32:42.528
and I was working in a boutique
in Redcar in the north of England.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.800
And I read in the Melody Maker that...

32:44.863 --> 32:48.868
It was a picture of Jon at his organ,
very Monty Python,

32:48.967 --> 32:55.384
saying, "Deep Purple still haven't found
a singer and are considering unknowns."

32:56.107 --> 33:00.351
Which was basically a little ding moment.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.015
Paice played me this tape, he said,

33:02.113 --> 33:04.059
"What do you think of this singer?"
And it was David Coverdale.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.992
And Jon would go,
"What's wrong with him?"

33:06.051 --> 33:09.123
And I'd go, "You can't have him after Gillan."

33:09.855 --> 33:12.734
Gillan was this God with the women,

33:12.824 --> 33:16.636
and we've got to have someone that can

33:16.728 --> 33:20.335
fire up the female interest there.

33:21.066 --> 33:24.570
And they said, "No, we disagree."

33:25.303 --> 33:27.715
The girls in the office think he is cute.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.683
I'm going, "Cute? Okay."

33:57.002 --> 34:00.575
Then we did Mistreated, which is
a bluesy thing, and we had that voice,

34:00.705 --> 34:03.618
Paul Rodgers kind of overturned to it.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.118
And Burn itself, the song worked,

34:06.244 --> 34:08.781
I felt we had some good songs there.

34:27.132 --> 34:30.443
And, of course, Glenn was very effervescent.

34:30.534 --> 34:34.141
He had a great funky way of playing the bass.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.915
He was a very rhythmic bass player.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.422
'Cause before that we had more of a...

34:52.056 --> 34:54.799
Glenn was more...

34:54.893 --> 34:56.668
There would be this rhythmic...

34:57.495 --> 35:01.739
He was very good
with his rhythmic syncopation.

35:15.513 --> 35:18.960
You know, it bears noting that,
for me, Ritchie Blackmore,

35:19.017 --> 35:21.861
unlike many guitar players,

35:22.787 --> 35:27.532
never lost his edge, if it were.

35:28.326 --> 35:32.172
Burn is every bit as important
<i>as</i> Space Truckin'

35:32.263 --> 35:34.709
and some of the later stuff.

35:34.833 --> 35:39.873
You can actually hear a guitar player
at the lop of his game.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.739
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:14.739 --> 36:17.811
Ritchie is convinced that the clock in his bar
is haunted
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.811 --> 36:17.909
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.909 --> 36:20.253
and chimes whenever it is happy.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.253 --> 36:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.480 --> 36:23.925
Very happy-

36:25.150 --> 36:27.494
-it doesn't do it at a set time or anything?
- No.

36:27.585 --> 36:29.258
-It does it just...
- No, only when it's happy.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.367
It will stay off for months.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.763
It's haunted, it was given to me by a friend.

36:41.866 --> 36:45.279
Ritchie's lifelong interest in haunting
and practical jokes

36:45.403 --> 36:48.782
was something else newcomer Coverdale
had to get used to.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.581
Some of them were very close to the knuckle.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.850
We were at Clearwell Castle
in Gloucestershire, Forest of Dean.

36:55.280 --> 37:00.457
A guy called Tony Ashton was coming down
from London for the weekend, for the hang.

37:01.786 --> 37:06.030
So Ritchie and I had the crew empty
the guest bedroom

37:06.124 --> 37:09.731
of all the furniture and took up the carpets,
took up the floor boards,

37:09.794 --> 37:13.071
and put a huge speaker, I mean, a really
big Marshall speaker

37:13.131 --> 37:16.806
underneath the bed.

37:16.935 --> 37:21.111
Put the boards back in,
put the carpets back over,

37:21.206 --> 37:23.277
everything just looking normal.

37:23.441 --> 37:26.752
Fed the wires down to another room
down the way,

37:26.811 --> 37:31.760
and sat up and waited for Tony Ashton
to come back from the pub.

37:31.816 --> 37:35.662
And as we hear the steps coming down
the corridor

37:35.787 --> 37:39.291
and Tony's door close.

37:39.390 --> 37:43.930
So we give him time to bathroom
and whatever and get into bed'

37:43.995 --> 37:48.501
And then we turn the speaker,
the microphone on, and I went up,

37:48.633 --> 37:53.912
started scratching against a board,
which you can imagine, this is under a bed,

37:54.005 --> 37:57.509
and saying, "Let me out."

37:59.010 --> 38:01.286
Well...

38:01.346 --> 38:04.691
We heard the most unearthly scream and...

38:04.783 --> 38:08.424
Which, you know, and panicking footsteps
running down the corridor.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.830
It certainly wasn't a guy's voice.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.128
Tony was still at the pub,

38:12.190 --> 38:14.693
this was a guest of the family
who owned the castle,

38:14.826 --> 38:19.036
who'd actually just come back from Bristol
after seeing The Exorcist movie.

38:19.130 --> 38:23.806
So, and was last seen heading
into the deep, dark forest.

38:24.536 --> 38:30.487
He has no boundaries
when it comes to his pranks, his japes.

38:34.546 --> 38:38.323
This is Ontario, 40 miles east of Los Angeles.

38:38.383 --> 38:41.364
The only sound you'll hear today are the
railway track to the south

38:41.452 --> 38:43.227
and the highway to the north.

38:44.656 --> 38:49.503
But the 40,000 plus people who gathered
here for the 1974 Cal Jam festival

38:49.561 --> 38:52.838
were about to witness Ritchie
at his most theatrical.

38:54.199 --> 38:59.581
Cal Jam, it was pretty romantic
when it happened, I'll tell you, it was.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.175
I remember a beautiful
southern California day.

39:07.745 --> 39:10.919
I'd come from driving a little
transit van's local gigs

39:11.049 --> 39:15.725
into flying in a customized, private 707, 727.

39:15.820 --> 39:19.768
The star ship, which is how we flew
into that environment.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.565
It was breath-taking to me.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.670
There must have been 350,000 people there.

39:24.762 --> 39:28.938
I think 100,000 burned the fence down.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.876
Then it was probably 350,000.

39:31.002 --> 39:34.347
When we look at the visual images
from above,

39:34.439 --> 39:39.946
you cannot imagine what it's like
to walk onto a stage and you can't see...

39:41.079 --> 39:45.619
You can see the skyline,
but in the skyline there is people.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.956
It really was stunning.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.292
There was a whole host,
the Emerson, Lake <i>&</i> Palmer

39:50.421 --> 39:54.699
and Black Sabbath, Earth, Wind & Fire,
Seals and Crofts,

39:54.792 --> 39:58.706
Black Oak Arkansas and Rare Earth.
I think that was the bill.

39:58.796 --> 40:01.709
And we were offered the headline slot.

40:01.799 --> 40:05.872
John Coletta, the management,
called me up six months before that festival

40:05.970 --> 40:09.315
and said, "They want you
to do California Jam."

40:09.440 --> 40:12.546
I said, "No, thanks.
I'm not interested in any more festivals."

40:12.644 --> 40:14.624
They are a nightmare, they always will be,

40:14.712 --> 40:17.625
there is always
complete catastrophe backstage.

40:17.715 --> 40:21.492
Nothing ever goes right,
you're always on late or early.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.828
The billing is all wrong, it's just awful.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.336
I said, "You know what, I might do it,

40:28.426 --> 40:32.499
"but we have to write down
all these conditions,

40:32.630 --> 40:35.167
"because I'm tired of doing festivals."

40:35.300 --> 40:39.749
We're gonna go on at dusk,
which is 9:00, around there.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.841
And I said, "We'll be the first band
with lights, 'cause that's important."

40:42.941 --> 40:45.182
It's a subliminal thing, people see lights,

40:45.310 --> 40:48.257
and they go, "I really like this band
compared to the rest of them."

40:48.346 --> 40:51.020
It's only 'cause they've got lights going on,

40:51.149 --> 40:55.655
and it's a psychological thing
that I've noticed, so I insisted on that.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.961
And they said, "Absolutely no problem."

40:59.357 --> 41:03.464
In the event, the organizers demanded
the band go on when it was still light.

41:03.528 --> 41:06.099
But Ritchie stuck to his guns.

41:06.197 --> 41:10.270
People were yelling and screaming
and threatening this and threatening that,

41:10.368 --> 41:14.680
and I just get the door bolted,
and I'd have a few drinks playing the guitar.

41:14.772 --> 41:16.217
I was not gonna go on.

41:16.674 --> 41:20.850
Finally when it was dark,
Ritchie, the musician, went on stage.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.891
You look fucking great from here.
Really good.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.788
And they were terrific on stage,
they were absolutely terrific.

41:27.885 --> 41:31.628
Ritchie is a spectacularly visual guitarist,
he was.

41:33.057 --> 41:36.231
He ran around, put his back to the audience,
threw his guitar around,

41:36.327 --> 41:38.568
and of course,
he did a bit of a Townshend sometimes,

41:38.663 --> 41:39.664
and smashed the guitar at the end.

41:39.731 --> 41:44.476
Of all the guys in Deep Purple,
it was Ritchie who was the most quixotic

41:44.569 --> 41:45.980
and mischievous.

41:46.571 --> 41:50.883
And the quixotic and mischievous Ritchie
was also on stage that night.

41:51.509 --> 41:56.049
He's had enough, you know,
he's playing away and you can hear,

41:56.147 --> 41:59.720
he said he could hear this guy going,
"Limey, get back in there, so I can..."

41:59.817 --> 42:01.763
You know, and all this kind of stuff,

42:01.853 --> 42:05.733
and he killed the camera,
it was brilliant showmanship.

42:05.823 --> 42:11.273
Probably among the definitive moments
of his kind of sense of spectacle

42:11.396 --> 42:16.038
and wanting to kind of turn it up
to another notch or whatever.

42:42.460 --> 42:46.203
And Ritchie had plans
for notching things up even further.

42:47.131 --> 42:48.974
So, I went to my roadie and said,

42:49.067 --> 42:52.139
"What I'm gonna do is
blow up the amplifiers."

42:52.270 --> 42:56.616
I said, "What I want you to do is
cover the amplifiers in petrol.

42:56.707 --> 43:01.417
"I'll go across one side of the stage.
You douse my Marshalls,

43:01.479 --> 43:03.584
"dummy Marshalls, with petrol."

43:03.648 --> 43:08.324
Ronnie Quinton, his beloved guitar tech,
who is no longer with us,

43:08.453 --> 43:13.596
loaded way too much gun powder
into Ritchie's stuff,

43:13.658 --> 43:17.162
so when that... It blew Paice's glasses off.
I thought I was gonna die.

43:37.949 --> 43:41.089
Exploded and, like, blew a hole in the stage,

43:41.185 --> 43:45.930
Paice's glasses got blown off, he was like...
He can't see anything.

43:46.023 --> 43:49.937
It made some cameraman temporarily deaf.

43:51.429 --> 43:52.874
But, it looked great.

43:53.831 --> 43:59.543
Everybody was up and happy.
Deep Purple just killed, I mean, they killed.

43:59.637 --> 44:05.849
Because this was still a bit of a transition
into heavy metal, still kinda new.

44:05.943 --> 44:08.389
They really came through, let me tell you.
They were good.

44:08.479 --> 44:14.327
I was a total novice outside of the remarkable

44:14.385 --> 44:18.731
schooling of working men's clubs
and it's just a walk in the park, you know,

44:18.823 --> 44:22.168
after you've played
Wingate Constitutional Club.

44:22.226 --> 44:25.070
Yeah, he did a great job, he pulled it off.

44:35.806 --> 44:37.080
And we had a helicopter,

44:37.208 --> 44:40.655
we were bundled into the helicopter
and flown out.

44:40.745 --> 44:44.215
The police were coming to arrest us,
for blowing up the stage,

44:44.315 --> 44:47.592
being dangerous to all the people,
what have you.

44:48.352 --> 44:54.064
You know, it worked, and the idea was
to upstage ELP, which I think we did.

44:55.092 --> 44:59.666
That was probably one of the peak moments
certainly in economic terms

44:59.764 --> 45:02.074
and in terms of record breaking.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.442
That was one of the highlights
of Deep Purple's career,

45:04.535 --> 45:06.845
because they played to this vast audience.

45:06.938 --> 45:09.179
I think it is in the Guinness Book of Records,

45:09.273 --> 45:12.618
some hundreds of thousands of people
at this event.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.690
I think it got better musically for them.

45:14.779 --> 45:18.352
They continued, thank God,
to progress musically.

45:18.449 --> 45:24.195
But, I don't know that their popularity
ever got bigger than Cal Jam ll'

45:26.290 --> 45:29.965
Cal Jam had radically ramped up
Ritchie's profile in America,

45:30.061 --> 45:34.305
but he was growing increasingly unhappy
with the funky direction the band was taking.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.308
My first LP Burn was great.

45:38.436 --> 45:42.578
We had Mistreated, Burn,
and it was all working.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.986
Now, the second record we made,
Stormbringer was good.

45:48.779 --> 45:53.319
But Jon, I think Ian, and even Dave,

45:53.417 --> 45:57.763
and, of course, Glenn,
were getting into this funk stuff.

46:01.158 --> 46:03.832
And I'm like, "That's not me."

46:04.328 --> 46:07.969
It's gonna be rock, blues.
I don't wanna be involved in that.

46:08.099 --> 46:11.103
Me, Jon and David wrote Holy Man together.

46:11.168 --> 46:14.479
And it was, "You can't do it right
with the one you love".

46:14.572 --> 46:18.611
It was group compositions, Hold On.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.986
Jon came up with that great
Fender Rhodes thing.

46:44.335 --> 46:45.939
And with his Deep Purple colleagues

46:46.037 --> 46:48.950
unwilling to take the music in the direction
he wanted,

46:49.040 --> 46:53.352
Ritchie now found someone who was,
a singer named Ronnie James Dio.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.788
That's when I did,

46:56.881 --> 46:59.384
I think, 16th Century Greensleeves
with Ronnie.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.877
He actually recorded an album with Ronnie
and the guys is in Elf.

47:17.968 --> 47:19.641
And we didn't know about this.

47:20.471 --> 47:21.882
And that turned out even better,

47:21.972 --> 47:25.852
and I went, "We've gotta form a band
'cause this is just flowing."

47:27.078 --> 47:30.685
There is none of this...
No committee meetings.

47:30.748 --> 47:33.490
And no briefcases involved

47:33.584 --> 47:35.825
and trying to get hold of people
that were never around.

47:36.887 --> 47:39.731
Because Purple became a big business,
the monster.

47:40.091 --> 47:44.062
So, that's when I left 'em
and formed Rainbow.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.174
Ritchie's new band was named after

47:46.263 --> 47:48.607
the famous rock and roll
Rainbow Bar and Grill

47:48.733 --> 47:50.940
on Sunset Boulevard in west Hollywood.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.174
<i>He was his</i> own <i>boss at last.</i>

48:18.062 --> 48:20.702
It was very exciting. We had Ronnie Dio.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.607
He could come around
and write a tune like that.

48:22.700 --> 48:27.115
I'd give him an idea, he'd put the top line
to it, everything was fresh.

48:27.204 --> 48:28.706
He had that ridiculous voice.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.647
After the first album,

48:30.741 --> 48:34.120
Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow became
simply Rainbow.

48:34.445 --> 48:37.949
We held auditions to put Rainbow together.

48:38.115 --> 48:41.756
And the 13th drummer was Cozy Powell.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.095
And he was the only one that could
play a shuffle.

48:45.656 --> 48:50.162
I was looking for some fire
and then Cozy came in and he did it.

49:08.179 --> 49:10.125
He and Ritchie got on very well together.

49:10.181 --> 49:15.028
They both shared a love,
apart from rock and roll, of pranking.

49:15.152 --> 49:17.598
Practical jokes, so...

49:17.688 --> 49:21.500
And, of course, Cozy is quite
a strong personality as well so,

49:21.592 --> 49:23.868
they respected each other
and they liked each other,

49:23.994 --> 49:27.032
and that was really the basis of the
success of Rainbow,

49:27.164 --> 49:32.273
I think, was this very powerful guitar
player, incredibly strong drummer

49:32.369 --> 49:34.975
and enormously talented singer.

49:35.039 --> 49:38.043
I think Cozy was a perfect foil for Ritchie,

49:38.142 --> 49:40.281
and I know even Cozy found it hard at times.

49:40.377 --> 49:42.687
Cozy used to tell me,
"It isn't easy, you know?"

49:42.780 --> 49:44.817
But I think Cozy had such
a respect for Ritchie

49:44.882 --> 49:47.055
and likewise the other way around.

49:47.184 --> 49:50.063
So, yeah, I think it was great combination.

49:50.154 --> 49:56.161
As a fan, it seemed like it was
one more step into what was heavy metal.

49:58.529 --> 50:03.569
Certainly with Dio singing,

50:03.701 --> 50:07.046
it was a remarkable step forward
in that genre.

50:07.137 --> 50:09.913
I mean, a lot of people today,
they listen to those records

50:10.007 --> 50:12.647
and they think that's where it really started.

50:12.743 --> 50:15.246
It's almost as if he is playing more
on those records,

50:15.379 --> 50:17.416
there is like more of Ritchie
on those records.

50:17.548 --> 50:21.257
It was a band in his own image,
which Deep Purple would never...

50:21.552 --> 50:25.398
Deep Purple were partly his image
and partly his creativity,

50:25.489 --> 50:27.400
but it belonged to everybody else.

50:27.491 --> 50:28.561
Rainbow was him.

50:28.659 --> 50:32.835
Rainbow was definitely his moment
of stepping into the spotlight

50:32.930 --> 50:35.035
and saying, "This is me,
this is where I want to go."

50:35.266 --> 50:39.112
Cozy suddenly turned up,
turned around, Cozy Powell, and said,

50:39.236 --> 50:41.876
"You know who my favourite band is?"

50:41.939 --> 50:44.749
It's "ABBA“ and we went...

50:46.043 --> 50:47.044
"ABBA!"

50:48.045 --> 50:50.582
"How could you?“ as in like...

50:50.681 --> 50:54.686
And he is like, "Yeah, I know,
but that's my favourite band."

50:54.885 --> 50:57.388
Then I <i>said,</i> "And mine."

50:59.456 --> 51:03.097
Then, I think
the bass player there went, "And mine."

51:03.193 --> 51:06.037
And we suddenly all went,
"Let's play some ABBA."

51:06.797 --> 51:10.939
But, unsurprisingly, no ABBA tracks made it
on to the band's second album,

51:11.035 --> 51:12.378
Rainbow Rising.

51:28.619 --> 51:33.090
Rainbow Rising was done in Munich
in the studio Arabella House, I think.

51:34.291 --> 51:37.738
That was done quickly and done very well,

51:37.828 --> 51:39.569
and we had a good time playing it.

51:39.663 --> 51:41.233
By the time we got
to Long Live Rock 'N' Roll,

51:41.332 --> 51:43.175
things were getting...

51:44.435 --> 51:47.939
Ronnie was more into his girlfriend Wendy,

51:48.072 --> 51:50.348
and things were starting to slow down
for ideas.

51:50.441 --> 51:54.184
I don't think Rainbow ever equaled
the success of Deep Purple,

51:54.311 --> 51:58.782
not in the public's perception
or in the critics' minds, should we say.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.189
Despite the fact that it did produce
some great music.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.789
It was very... And it was a great live band.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.129
It was very entertaining,

52:06.190 --> 52:09.694
and gave Ritchie Blackmore opportunities
to play with other people.

52:10.260 --> 52:13.036
As far as the personnel changes go,

52:13.130 --> 52:18.011
you would need an abacus
and a Cray Computer

52:18.102 --> 52:20.446
to figure that one out.

52:20.537 --> 52:24.781
But, that family tree is tall, wide
and complicated.

52:24.875 --> 52:27.879
But through it all, there is Ritchie Blackmore.

52:51.301 --> 52:55.909
And a Ritchie Blackmore who was still
unpredictable and more than a little scary.

52:56.073 --> 52:59.077
I have seen Ritchie lose it with someone,
I better not say who it is.

52:59.209 --> 53:02.918
But it was very explosive.

53:03.047 --> 53:06.893
Yeah, he doesn't suffer people to be fools.

53:06.984 --> 53:09.931
And I know Ritchie can be quite physical.

53:10.254 --> 53:14.430
Ritchie got physical in Vienna in 1977.

53:15.592 --> 53:20.837
We were playing in Austria 10
about 5,000-7,000 people.

53:20.931 --> 53:25.937
A good show and this little girl comes
up to the front stage,

53:26.070 --> 53:29.608
she had come up and handed up a note,

53:29.740 --> 53:33.381
like, "I'm a big fan of the band"
or something like that, I don't know.

53:33.444 --> 53:35.117
And I'm just watching her

53:35.212 --> 53:39.786
and the next minute she gets hit by this
guy with a truncheon and this bouncer,

53:40.617 --> 53:43.928
and, of course, I thought,
"He is not gonna get away with that."

53:44.021 --> 53:46.262
So I kicked him.

53:46.356 --> 53:50.361
And I have strong legs,
so of course I broke his jaw

53:50.461 --> 53:53.601
and he went down, blood, and l went...

53:53.964 --> 53:57.969
The resourceful stage crew hid Ritchie
in a large flight case

53:58.102 --> 53:59.911
and pushed him towards the exit.

54:00.037 --> 54:04.452
Every exit had police helmets and dogs.

54:04.541 --> 54:08.990
And they were about to push me up
into the truck, into the lorry.

54:09.379 --> 54:13.987
And they insisted, opened it up,
and, of course,

54:14.118 --> 54:17.622
I just came out like a Jack in the box,
"Hi, everybody.“

54:18.489 --> 54:21.936
And then they locked me up for four days,
which was pretty miserable.

54:22.326 --> 54:26.172
'Cause the first night, they would just like,
throw me on the floor.

54:27.331 --> 54:30.244
And they wanted to beat the shit out of me
because I just hit one of their guys.

54:30.667 --> 54:33.238
The consulate was of no use whatsoever,

54:33.337 --> 54:36.147
they just came and said,
"You have done a really bad thing.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.345
"You might be here forever."

54:39.409 --> 54:40.752
That's a wakeup call.

54:40.844 --> 54:45.486
You know, I had a bad temper.
My temper is not so bad any more

54:45.582 --> 54:46.617
'cause I always think about that.

54:46.950 --> 54:49.089
As well as his unscheduled jail visit,

54:49.186 --> 54:52.190
Ritchie now had to contend with
a changing music market

54:52.289 --> 54:53.962
and an unchanging Ronnie.

55:09.706 --> 55:12.778
Ronnie Dio and Ritchie Blackmore
had a chemistry,

55:12.876 --> 55:17.188
but then, as Blackmore got further
into the Rainbow career,

55:17.281 --> 55:21.559
he saw himself as wanting to become
a little bit more commercial.

55:21.652 --> 55:27.000
And Dio very much wanted to stay
into the myths and the dragons feel

55:27.057 --> 55:31.199
that he would put forward
in the lyrics, metaphorical,

55:31.295 --> 55:33.400
rather than physical, than actual.

55:33.530 --> 55:36.409
So that the two of them went their
separate ways, as we know.

55:37.034 --> 55:40.504
But that isn't the whole story,
as Ritchie now reveals.

55:41.205 --> 55:44.311
Wendy, apparently,
had told him transatlantically,

55:44.408 --> 55:46.888
she said, called him up and said, "Ronnie,

55:46.977 --> 55:50.652
"Ritchie is on the front page
of Circus magazine in America

55:50.747 --> 55:52.226
"and you two aren't.

55:52.316 --> 55:54.193
"There should have been the three of us."

55:54.685 --> 55:56.392
That's what did it.

55:56.486 --> 56:02.402
And he said to me, "Cozy and I are not
gonna... We are not your sidekicks,

56:02.492 --> 56:04.995
"and we are not standing for it."

56:05.362 --> 56:08.707
I don't want to work with someone
who is that trivial, that ridiculous.

56:08.765 --> 56:13.441
I said, "I can't work with this guy any more,
just get him out of my life."

56:13.570 --> 56:19.111
And I remembered Graham Bonnet
from the Marbles,

56:19.209 --> 56:23.351
and I said to Roger Glover, I said,
"What about trying to find him?

56:23.447 --> 56:24.949
"I wonder what he is doing these days."

56:25.048 --> 56:28.518
Sol had to learn a Rainbow song
because I knew nothing.

56:28.619 --> 56:31.122
I didn't know who Rainbow was,
I had no clue.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.599
Sol had to go out and buy albums
and listen to the music.

56:33.690 --> 56:37.194
And I thought,
"I don't think this is really me."

56:37.394 --> 56:40.307
I'm more into like R&B and pop kind of stuff.

56:40.464 --> 56:43.308
That guy had an amazing voice.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.574
Could sing an F-sharp above Top C
and that was going some.

56:46.637 --> 56:48.116
I remember going over there one afternoon,

56:48.205 --> 56:50.048
and I heard this
Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow

56:50.140 --> 56:52.552
or something in the background,
and it was off of my album.

56:52.643 --> 56:55.920
I said to Roger, "Why is he playing that?"
He <i>says,</i> "He just loves your voice."

56:55.979 --> 56:59.426
Ritchie also loved the idea of
being more commercial.

57:23.407 --> 57:24.784
We needed some radio play.

57:24.841 --> 57:27.014
We got a little bit too underground.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.021
Since You've Been Gone, we got rid of that,
and <i>we...</i>

57:29.112 --> 57:32.616
'Cause it's a number one, all of a sudden
we were a big band.

57:33.850 --> 57:38.526
We were riding high at that time,
1980 was our biggest moment, I think.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.129
We were quite big in England.

57:41.591 --> 57:42.865
I love Since You've Been Gone.

57:42.960 --> 57:48.342
It's uncompromising and it has the perfect
element of pop, which is you can sing it

57:48.432 --> 57:51.538
and it's in your head all day,
and it's passionate.

57:51.635 --> 57:56.812
It has a real tug on your emotions.

57:56.873 --> 58:00.377
But Ritchie's in it,
and Ritchie is powering the whole thing.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.047
The under solo is just brilliant.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.506
They did the immortal version of it.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.979
Powered by their more commercial sound,

58:25.068 --> 58:29.414
Rainbow headlined the first ever
Monsters of Rock festival at Donington.

58:30.474 --> 58:32.010
The critics hated us.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.919
For whatever reason,
we were not a fashionable,

58:36.013 --> 58:38.220
on the front page of Rolling Stones
type of band.

58:38.315 --> 58:41.762
We were... They just hated us.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.559
But the more they hated us,

58:43.653 --> 58:47.157
the more the people kind of went,
"We love them."

58:47.657 --> 58:49.432
The fans may have loved Rainbow,

58:49.559 --> 58:53.268
but Ritchie was now having a problem
with Graham Banners hair.

58:53.397 --> 58:57.436
Ritchie was 100% behind me being
in the band,

58:57.534 --> 59:00.208
but 100% against my haircut.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.245
There was a hair situation.

59:03.340 --> 59:07.584
We were known to have Denim people
following us,

59:07.677 --> 59:10.283
and most people were kind of growing
their hair long in those days.

59:10.514 --> 59:13.222
I went to get my hair cut in Sheffield
really short.

59:13.283 --> 59:15.456
I mean, like, spiky and the whole thing.

59:20.957 --> 59:23.767
And l went on stage
and Ritchie hadn't seen me all day,

59:23.860 --> 59:26.306
and there he was playing his guitar,
and the first song comes up

59:26.396 --> 59:27.636
and he turns to me and he goes...

59:27.764 --> 59:29.471
You know, his mouth dropped.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.773
He was singing to the audience
and doing his bit,

59:31.868 --> 59:34.974
and I saw the back of the shaved neck,
you know that.

59:35.072 --> 59:40.146
You know, very cut hair and I went,

59:40.243 --> 59:42.814
"I'm just gonna put my guitar across
his head."

59:42.913 --> 59:44.153
But then I might...

59:44.247 --> 59:46.318
I'll be back in prison again, you know.

59:46.450 --> 59:49.954
I really was, like, so tempted just to
take it off and go whack.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.904
Graham Bonnet and his hair lived to sing
another day.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.504
But he had no luck persuading drummer
Cozy Powell to stay on board.

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:12.082
Powell didn't like the overtly
commercial work the band was now doing.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.647
And he was gone.

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:19.193
And it was a very sad day,
and he left the band and later I did.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:22.627
That was my last show too,
but I didn't know this at that time.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:24.427
Graham Bonnet was a great singer

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:28.128
and Down to Earth was a thoroughly
undervalued Rainbow album.

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:31.035
But again, the problem was
that Blackmore saw Bonnet

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.438
not quite as having what it took
in terms of personality,

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.875
to allow Blackmore to be himself.

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:40.038
Song writing wasn't good,
the way we wanted it to.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.444
It was very slow.

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:45.850
Nothing was happening, we had one song
and that was the song Russ Ballard wrote.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.888
I Surrender, the song was called.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.285
And that's all we had.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.882
And so we... It was...

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.519
I left because Ritchie didn't
come to rehearsal sometimes.

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.137
Graham left the band in 1980.

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:14.047
Like a month or so later, I thought,
"What have I done?"

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:17.243
I have left something that was great.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.810
It would be nice to see him again
'cause I like him very much.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:26.361
He was a good friend, and he taught me a lot
about the music I was suddenly pushed into,

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.260
which I knew nothing about,
and he was a great teacher.

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:33.200
Ritchie's friend Barry Ambrosio suggested
Joe Lynn Turner

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.395
as a replacement for Graham Bonnet.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.936
He said, "Listen to this record."

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:42.532
I said "Look, Barry, I've heard
so many singers, I can! hear any more.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:44.078
"I've got to get out of here."

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:47.842
He said, "Just listen to this,"
and he played one track as I was leaving.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:49.178
And I went,

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.775
"Actually, that sounds interesting,
who is this guy?“

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.912
And he said, "Guy from New Jersey."

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:56.785
I didn't know that he came to see me.

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:00.122
I later found out when I got a phone call,

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:04.359
living in Manhattan, lower Manhattan
in the west village,

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.294
one-room studio, I think you call it.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.562
And mattress on the floor,

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.299
money running out.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:14.932
And got a phone call from Barry Ambrosio,

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:17.637
and he put Ritchie on the phone,

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.475
and of course I... Complete disbelief.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:24.108
And he said, "No, it's really me."
And I said, "Well, all right."

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.551
And they told...
They put their road manager on

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:29.817
and told me the train to take
and to go out to the studio.

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:59.512
I was playing in New Jersey,
and I went to see him.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:03.955
And I really liked his voice,
very resonant and warm.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:06.858
He came in with a couple of beers
and said, "You got the job if you want it."

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.156
And I <i>said,</i> "Want it? I need it."

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:14.090
And kept me there in the studio
and we just kept being creative,

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.637
and Glover and I started to write more lyrics,

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:22.006
and we finished the album Difficult to Cure,
like, in a couple of weeks, I think,

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.543
since my entrance.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:27.871
Ritchie recorded three Rainbow albums
with Joe Lynn Turner.

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:33.849
I think I wrote, with Joe,

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:37.186
one of my favourite tunes
which is Street of Dreams.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.729
That, to me, was the ultimate Rainbow song.
I love that song.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.357
Come on the jukebox,
I go, "I'm proud of that."

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.860
'Cause it was exactly where I wanted to go.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.028
When we heard it,
we knew we had something.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:54.336
There was just chills up and down our...
We felt it.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.673
We said, "Man, this is deep,
this is something."

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.423
And the fact that I could kind of
write something that was poppy

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.557
was something new for me.

01:04:20.657 --> 01:04:22.000
And I liked that groove.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:26.234
I just don't want to play, crash, crash, crash
for the sake of it.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.706
I've got to hear a melody.

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:32.439
Melody was always at the bottom of,
for me musically, where I was going.

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:52.858
While Ritchie had been developing Rainbow,

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:58.269
his Deep Purple fans still wanted to see the
classic Mark ll line-up back together again.

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:05.872
1983, I think, the management called me up
and said, "Purple wants to re-form."

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:07.778
I said, "Well, I have to think about it."

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:11.944
Rainbow was just now taking off really big
in America.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:15.989
And we were really getting somewhere,
we were doing big shows.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:20.322
I don't know if I want... It's so easy
to just go back to Purple, you know.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.964
I was like...

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.827
And Gillan was really up for it.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:28.333
And I'm like, "Okay, let's try it."

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:34.337
I put up no fuss, no fight, no nothing
like that, so I really felt good about it.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.570
And also at that point in time,

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:40.273
I had a solo album for Elektra Records,

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.747
and things were going well for me.

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:44.842
And Ritchie and I promised to get back
together again anyway.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.855
So, I had no compunction about it.
I felt good about it.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.652
Of course there was money entered into it.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:55.821
And the management is going,
"It's worth X amount..."

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:59.833
I'm like, "Might be an interesting idea.
Okay, I'll try it.“

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.361
Cut a long story short.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.699
So we did it.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:08.498
You know, we had a good time,
Perfect Strangers is a good record.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:10.335
And we all had a good time doing it.

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.847
It was very comfortable being with them.

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.298
Perfect Strangers was a brilliant
comeback album by Purple.

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.629
It was a phenomenal performance

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.170
because it got Mark ll back together.

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.036
They did it in the mid-80's fashion.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.471
They weren't living in the past.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:43.567
They weren't living in 1971, 72,

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.238
they were actually being part of
the modern hard rock world.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:51.576
I think the relationship at the time
between Gillan and Blackmore,

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:55.349
which is always pointed out
as being the problem, was quite amicable.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:59.750
The amicable band
toured in support of the album.

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.251
They were trying to say

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.331
that Bruce Springsteen
was doing the biggest business.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:07.595
Biggest business was us and Grateful Dead,
then Bruce Springsteen.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:11.937
I don't know what people see
in Bruce Springsteen whatsoever.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:13.096
I have never got that.

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:17.069
The ticket sales showed
that the old magic was still there,

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.544
but so were the old rivalries with Gillan.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:25.175
I put it down to he wanted to kind of
maybe steer the band,

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:26.879
and I was steering the band.

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:29.685
So I think it was that more than anything.

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:32.884
Of course it worked, I thought,
Perfect Strangers worked.

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:36.692
Everybody was on form, we played,
it worked.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:39.062
But, we should have stopped right there.

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:43.136
And then we did...
House of Blue Light, to me, was disastrous.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:13.159
And the relationship with Ian
was soon back in the disaster zone too.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.461
He had lost his voice completely.

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.231
And we are going, "What are we gonna do?"

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:21.399
I was always already disgusted with Ian,
we weren't getting along.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.808
Soto me, I was like,
"We gotta get another singer.

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.005
"I mean, this is just a joke."

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:31.948
By 1987 Ritchie had played with scares
of musicians and dozens cf bands.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:35.511
A self-confessed wind-up merchant
who thrived on conflict.

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:38.626
The uneasy rider
was about to meet his match.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.184
Appropriately enough, on the football field.

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.192
I used to have my roadie call up
radio stations too.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:49.361
Deep purple would like 10 do
a game of soccer against you,

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.631
if you feel like playing a charity.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.537
It's kind of my fairy tale Cinderella story

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:58.475
because I was working for this radio station
on Long Island.

01:08:58.533 --> 01:08:59.706
I was interning there.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.715
And apparently somebody from Deep Purple
had called up.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.977
So the DJs came out and they played,

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:07.350
and Purple showed up,
it was Ritchie and Roger.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:10.117
He signed an autograph for me
and he looked up at me and said,

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:13.160
in that very classy English accent
that I'm sure you are familiar with,

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.323
"You are very beautiful girl."
And I went, "That's nice."

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.956
And that would have been
my Ritchie Blackmore story

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:19.328
that he said I was beautiful.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:21.027
And that was enough at that point.

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:22.966
And I said, "Thank you",
and I walked off the field.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.233
And he sent his roadies through the crowd
to find out who I was

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.309
and to ask me 10 meet him at a pub later.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:33.808
Candice Night was a musical New Yorker,
who had been modelling from age 12.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.506
She had her own radio rock show,

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:40.645
and had studied communications
at New York Institute of Technology.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.919
And Ritchie had the most brilliant, proper

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:47.995
upper-class English way of breaking the ice.

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:51.031
- He was taking off his soccer cleats.
- Oh, right.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.897
And his dirty, mud-filled,
sweaty soccer socks

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.267
and he balled one up
and threw it right in my face.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:00.432
That's the way to get a girl.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.373
And I didn't worry about my nails
after that any more

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.241
'cause I thought this is ridiculous,
and we just...

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.937
After that, there was really nothing...

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.174
That totally relaxed

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:10.000
-the whole entire environment.
- It was a magical smell.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.911
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
-the whole entire environment.
- It was a magical smell.

01:10:10.911 --> 01:10:11.507
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.750
He said to me that
when I walked into the room,
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.844
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.051
meeting him at that pub that afternoon.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.051 --> 01:10:17.113
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:22.000
He said, "I felt like, when you walked in
that an old friend had walked into the room.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.062
He said, "I felt like, when you walked in
that an old friend had walked into the room.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.597
"Like it felt like home."

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:26.257
Ritchie now had an ally who put him at ease.

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:31.031
Soon their shared interest in medieval life
and music was to take centre stage.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:34.131
But first, a replacement had to be found
for Gillan.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.939
Ritchie approached his Rainbow vocalist,
Joe Lynn Turner.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.809
At first, Joe hesitated, I think.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.816
You know, Paice is going well
and he was in Rainbow.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.942
So I was like, "Yeah, well..."

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.419
Got any other ideas?

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.656
And Jon's like, "Yeah, sounds great."

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.091
So we tried him out, it worked,
and then he was in.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:58.230
He started playing Hey Joe,
I grabbed the mike, started singing it.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.824
Never even said, "Hello" to Jon or Ian
at that point.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.096
Finished the song and then there were
some handshakes.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:06.663
And Jon started to play this keyboard bit,

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:09.767
which later became on the Purple album
The Cut Runs Deep.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:12.438
And I started singing the exact lyric

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:15.915
as Ritchie always called it,
I had a magic bag of lyrics.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:19.748
And I would just pull out a lyric that suited
this and sing a melody,

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:23.847
and it was the exact lyric... There it was.
There's the song.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.859
So Jon and Ian were convinced
that I should be the guy.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:51.543
But it was 10 be Joe Lynn's only album
with Deep Purple.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.678
He left the band in 1992.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:57.221
There was a lot of frustration going on,

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.155
lot of unhappiness.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:04.458
The guys, I believe it was Ian and Jon,
and I say this with all love and respect

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:07.057
felt they needed Ian Gillan back in the band.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:11.400
And Ritchie was staunch about me staying
in the band and there was a...

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:17.410
And there just wasn't any way that I could
deal with the emotions that were happening.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.744
So, I think I quit and got fired
at the same time.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.749
Whatever, doesn't really matter.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.255
But, it was nerve-racking and just turmoil

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.915
and very stressful.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:35.325
Meanwhile, Ritchie and Candice
had moved in together.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:38.024
- By '91 I had moved in with you.
- Yeah.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.863
She moved in but I didn't know who she was.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:44.728
I just knew that there was a great female
in the house.

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:45.771
I'm not gonna knock it.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:48.205
- I don't know who she is.
- I locked my door every night, I bolted it.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:50.437
I was on tour <i>as</i> his girlfriend, yes.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:53.376
But at our parties at the house...

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:57.043
When we have parties at our house,
everybody has to contribute something,

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:59.746
so if Ritchie is going to bring out
the acoustic guitar and play for people,

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.913
he wants everybody to give
a little bit of themselves.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:05.288
So he doesn't care if it's a speech
about the Alamo, right?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:09.796
Or tap dance or a song
or something, anything.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:14.631
So, when I was at the parties with Ritchie,

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.704
he and I would be doing songs together.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.033
That's how he first got me singing with him.

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:22.766
The first song they wrote together
was a wedding anniversary present

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.776
for Candice's parents.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:29.808
This is something that Rainbow
would never have done,

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.941
play a waltz.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:33.910
A waltz, go.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.264
Just follow me.

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:56.776
With what we didn't see...

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.445
That was very subtle.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.697
- First song we wrote?
- Be Mine Tonight.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.629
That's what makes me laugh
when people say,

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.670
"She must have made him do
Renaissance music"

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.965
because you don't make him do anything.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.473
You never make Ritchie Blackmore
do anything.

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:32.707
Everything that he...
His choice of direction is solely up to him,

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:36.214
and l feel like I'm really on a journey
that he has led the way and taken...

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:39.286
He is the captain of this journey.

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.979
I'll be the co-captain, that's fine.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.958
Ritchie would make one more album
with Deep Purple.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.390
With Joe Lynn Turner gone,

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:50.294
the band put down backing tracks
and looked for a singer.

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:54.232
The band thinks that we should get Gillan
back, and the record label,

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:59.033
they sent the tapes of Ian singing,
like, three songs that we had done.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.734
Three backing tracks
he had put his voice over.

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.741
And I'm like...

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.575
"This is absolutely dreadful.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:12.085
"This is rotten to the core,
this is just rubbish."

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:13.915
That's how bad it was to me.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.717
It was deadly.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:21.988
And then he said, "How much would you take
to work with that?"

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:25.421
I said, "Well, it really doesn't come into it."

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.228
The album was made with Gillan on vocals.

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:33.603
Then the record company wanted the band
to go on tour to promote it.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:36.609
It was also the 25th anniversary of Mark ll.

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:40.339
Ritchie demanded a vast fee
thinking it would be refused,

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:42.541
but his strategy backfired.

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:48.453
I went, "You know what? I'll take X amount",
which was over the top.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:53.221
Just to get them off my back
so I could look for another singer.

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:56.388
<i>And ma] came back with EMS,</i>

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:59.558
"Okay, they'll pay you that
if you work with Gillan."

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:03.126
And I went, "Now I'm caught."

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:32.488
Of course I got halfway through the tour
and I was like, "I can't take this any more."

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:38.833
I'm selling my soul here, this is awful.
This is dreadful, certainly, you know.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:45.779
Ian and I had a showdown with spaghetti,
and it was in Cleveland.

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:50.139
Jim picked up my food from catering,

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:53.310
and Ian had gone, "Who is that for?"

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.116
And Jim goes, "It's Ritchie's food."

01:16:55.177 --> 01:17:00.354
He says, "Let me add some ketchup to it."
And, of course, he put ketchup all over it.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:05.262
And I went up to him and I said,
"Did you do this to my food?"

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.766
And he went, "Yeah."

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.337
And with that, I saw Jon Lord go...

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:16.537
And they all parted,
it was like a high noon, you know.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.475
I went, "Really?"

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:22.145
And then I got it and went, right in his face.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.611
Well, battle rages on,

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.815
this was the first time we played
in Czechoslovakia,

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:33.986
and he asked me to sing the...

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:37.462
Just like a vocal part just...
Like background...

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.625
Candice was singing off stage
and out of sight,

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:43.363
which confused some local reviewers.

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:47.162
There was a Czechoslovakian paper
who had written the review and said that,

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:52.076
"Jon Lord must have sampled
a female vocal into his keyboards

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:55.012
"because they could
clearly hear some girl singing."

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:08.853
I knew if I went 10 the manager and I said,
"I want to leave Bruce Payne management."

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:12.925
That would go no further
and I'd be back at square one.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:17.402
So I thought, "I'm gonna have to write a letter
to the band to explain how I feel,

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:19.063
"and I've got to leave,

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.437
"and I'll not be going to Japan with them."

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:41.255
Ritchie played his last concert
with Deep Purple in Helsinki

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.956
on 17th November, 1993.

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:49.462
So we went back to the hotel,

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:52.368
and we proceeded to say goodbyes.

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.465
I think I said goodbye to Ian Paice,
that was it.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:57.475
Everybody else just ran away.

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:01.437
Paice came up to me and said,
"Make some good decisions"

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:04.643
-and left, and Candice was with me.
- That's right.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.152
And I think Jon was too embarrassed
to say anything.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:08.721
- Jon went right up to his room.
- Yeah.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.825
It was such a relief.

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:18.326
Ritchie reformed Rainbow,
now with Dougie White on vocals

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:21.901
and made one final album with them too,
Stranger in Us All.

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:42.012
I think Rainbow probably gave him
a little bit more freedom in that regard,

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:46.355
and then the album I did certainly did
give him more freedom.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.125
This freedom also enabled Ritchie
and Candice

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.255
to develop their writing partnership,

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:55.130
and the album included one of
the first songs they wrote together, Ariel.

01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:17.316
The Blackmore side thing kind of happened
when we were doing the last Rainbow record.

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:21.191
We would kind of get together as a son of
a jam night thing at the end of the evening

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:24.162
when we were recording at
Long View Farm in Massachusetts.

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:28.224
And we would just kind of sit around
the fire and they were just gonna jam,

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:32.669
and they would do stuff, Renaissance stuff
like Greensleeves, that sort of thing.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.872
When I was 10,

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:39.412
there was this kid singing Greensleeves,
and I was really taken by that mode.

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:46.678
Just, it was very reminiscent of another time,

01:20:46.742 --> 01:20:48.244
almost spiritual, I thought.

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:07.567
And it just seemed to go straight to my soul.

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:08.733
And I have always been that way.

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:11.573
If I hear medieval music,
I'll immediately come alive.

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:17.449
Ritchie and Candice
formed Blackmore's Night

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:21.419
and made their first album
Shadow of the Moon in 1997.

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:27.893
His escape from the stress and pressures
of that rock and roll world

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:31.454
wound up being just to sit
and just open up on acoustic.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:35.125
And just really look into the fire place
and just go someplace else.

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:39.205
And that's where I think the beginning of
our project happened, really.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:59.317
He often says that if you listen 10
Smoke on the Water,

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:03.261
you'll hear medieval fourths and fifths,
the modal scales of that era.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:06.299
So that was going back to 1971,
so that was in him there as well,

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.460
and then of course, fast-forward to Rainbow
and you've got

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:12.505
everything from Temple of The King,
16th Century Greensleeves.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:16.132
So it's a lot of medieval flare
in a lot of those songs.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:41.634
And we are still scratching the surface,
it's like,

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.001
I still feel there's so far to go with it.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:48.267
Whereas with the others I felt
we were at the end.

01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:50.804
One of the best compliments I had was,

01:22:50.866 --> 01:22:54.939
"I hate medieval and Renaissance music,
but I love your music."

01:22:55.270 --> 01:23:00.686
And I went, "That's a big compliment,
much more than you think."

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:22.339
With our show, it's more the audience is
part of us, we are there to entertain them.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:25.241
We are not there to show off
and wiggle our hips.

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:28.708
Since that first album in 1997,

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:31.580
Ritchie and Candice
have made another nine together.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:42.854
When Ritchie plunged into medieval music,

01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:47.367
it wasn't so much as a surprise
as a natural course of events.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.354
I also feel that urge because somehow
when you've done all the big heavy stuff,

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:15.189
it's always attractive but you want to
explore the other side.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:21.535
The minstrels, the peasant,
kind of walking from town to town,

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:25.867
just telling the news from the last town,
bit of gossip,

01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:28.635
plays a few tunes, that's what I relate to.

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:33.743
That doesn't mean that some of the songs
don't still include modern rock influences.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.060
It's like me, I love what I do.

01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:54.566
I truly love what I do, and I can hear
that Ritchie loves what he does,

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:55.964
and I salute him for it.

01:25:11.974 --> 01:25:17.856
True musicians, people who don't
have a choice, you know,

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:21.189
they just love music
and that's the path they follow.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:25.357
If he wants to switch into something else,

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:28.934
that's because his inner musical inspiration
pulls him there,

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:33.439
and true musicians are almost slaves to that.

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:36.301
The music may be historically inspired,

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:41.610
but Ritchie's electric guitar virtuosity is still
very much a part of their medieval journey.

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:06.137
He sees himself, I think,
as the quiet musketeer.

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:09.573
His rather romantic sort of
heroic dashing figure.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.702
I never feel like we are done, we're just like...

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.040
We are still learning so much about

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:15.376
the instruments and the songs
and ourselves, really'

01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:33.931
It takes me back to another life.

01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:38.664
It might be a past life, reincarnation.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.867
I just love to be in the 1500's,
without getting the plague,

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:46.105
and having central heating
and a satellite dish.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:50.547
Whereas if I hear rock and roll,
I've heard it all before, Christ.

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:54.951
It all ended about 30 years ago,
everybody now is so generic.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.514
How long can you keep flogging something?

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:03.692
It's nearly 50 years since
the young school boy from Heston

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:06.356
decided to show his teachers
they were wrong about him,

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:08.696
by achieving true excellence on the guitar.

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.236
And to make good on the faith
his parents had shown in him

01:27:11.293 --> 01:27:14.035
by putting the music first.

01:27:14.129 --> 01:27:15.631
Of all the great guitar players,

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:18.438
he was the one that people knew least about,
I think,

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.944
and that was partly his own doing.

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:23.949
His confidence was overwhelming.

01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:25.450
It <i>was</i> frightening.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.110
Inspiring and frightening.

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:32.983
I think Ritchie will be remembered as
somebody wild and untamed

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.151
to the end of his days.

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.785
And I think that's a magnificent thing to be.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:42.334
I can buy a Strat, you can buy a Strat, right?
We can get a Marshall, he can get a Marshall.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:45.268
But, none of us ever wind up
sounding like Ritchie.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:50.440
A high degree of being completely
in the moment, impulsive,

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:54.345
and just being kind of true to himself

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:59.077
and true to what his perception of
that moment was in a live situation.

01:27:59.174 --> 01:28:01.677
He is not an extrovert,
he is very much an introvert.

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:05.257
And when you have somebody like that,
they create brilliantly,

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:09.591
but there is also a lot of depth
that they are always constantly dealing with.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:14.200
There is nothing better than just sitting
with the guitar and emoting.

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:16.131
I can be in Hawaii,

01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:19.331
and everybody is on water skis and things.

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:22.271
I'm watching the dolphins,
but I'm in my room just looking out,

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:25.777
looking at the horizons, gotta be playing.

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:29.838
And that's my friend that
I'm kind of emoting with.

01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:33.842
My gut feeling is that Ritchie is probably
at his best when he

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:40.052
tends to actually live out the rather quiet,

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:46.121
withdrawn, artistic and thoughtful person
that I think really

01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:48.064
is what he is ultimately about.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.193
When people get things all in perspective,

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:55.173
Ritchie will be right there as one of the
cornerstones of what rock and roll is today.

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:58.234
There's a long list of rock guitar players

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.574
that wouldn't exist
without Ritchie Blackmore.

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:06.008
There are people who enter this band thing
for lots of different reasons,

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.317
for money, for fame and for the chicks.

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:13.826
It seems to me Ritchie Blackmore
entered into this for the music.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:19.655
And for the two people who encouraged
him to take guitar lessons in the first place,

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:22.860
his mother and especially his father.

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:27.166
He came to the Albert Hall
when we did the orchestra thing,

01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:30.709
Deep Purple and the orchestra, he loved that.
