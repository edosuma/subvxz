00:32.991 --> 00:34.576

<i>He told me about their triumphs,
their discoveries.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:43.418
<i>But there was something
about those adventures he didn't tell me.</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:48.048
<i>Treasure hunting, exploring...</i>

01:20.705 --> 01:23.416
We gotta be hush-hush
about this, JB, you know that, right?

01:23.416 --> 01:24.667
We can't tell your friends.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.962
No, come on. Dad, they're just
as much a part of this as you are.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.673
-  Want to put them in danger?
- What? Dad--

01:30.673 --> 01:33.551
Would you knowingly put them
in harm's way if you could help it?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.969
If you could help it?

01:36.679 --> 01:37.680
I didn't think so.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.516
Splits are still the same.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.519
We'll tell them later,
but for now, for safety...

01:43.186 --> 01:44.604

02:09.462 --> 02:13.800
Yeah, yeah, so we, um... we went
to the archives in Charleston, and, uh...

02:16.302 --> 02:17.804
it was... it was a dead end.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.765
A dry hole. So...

02:21.933 --> 02:23.351
So that's the gold,

02:24.477 --> 02:27.272
the cross, and now El Dorado.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.274
We're three-for-three, guys.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.863
The streak continues.

02:35.947 --> 02:36.865
That's great.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.366
See you, John B.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.707
I'm going fishing. Thanks for the beer.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.023
- We're together, right?
- Yeah.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.026
So that means
we always tell each other the truth.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.404
Sarah, I am telling the truth.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.116
What, you think I'm... I'm lying?

03:20.116 --> 03:22.160
- Is that what you think? No, I...
- No, no, it's just...

03:22.911 --> 03:24.704
The story that you told us

03:25.205 --> 03:26.831
isn't really adding up.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.542
You guys get the Twinkie
and go off to Charleston

03:29.542 --> 03:32.754
without telling anyone,
and I'm just trying to understand why.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.673
If there's anything
that you can't tell the others,

03:35.673 --> 03:36.883
you can tell me.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.343
Mmm.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.888
Look, look at me. What happened?

03:42.722 --> 03:45.516
You've just been acting so off
since your dad got back.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.726
- What happened?
- Yes, John B.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.938
- It's me. I'm on your side.
- Okay, Sarah, you know what happened?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.439
My dad came back.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.191
- And he's trying to help all of us.
- Uh-huh.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.109
And meanwhile, your dad tried to kill you.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.571
And I'm sorry
that you can't deal with that.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.909
Am I wrong?

04:07.872 --> 04:10.124
Well, then call me
when you wanna tell the truth.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.137
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm doing great, Dad.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.640
Come on. We got work to do.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.892
A 500-year quest is calling.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.440
<i>Dad?</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.943
<i>-</i> <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, I can hear you now.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.653
<i>The cross is not on the train, Rafe.</i>

04:38.653 --> 04:41.239
It did not arrive.
Somebody stole the cross.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.740
Oh my God. Wait, who stole it?

04:42.740 --> 04:45.660
I don't know who stole it, Rafe!

04:46.411 --> 04:47.453
<i>That's rough.</i>

04:47.453 --> 04:49.914
I mean, it could've been
anybody, really, right?

04:49.914 --> 04:53.376
Not really, Rafe.
It could be one of a very few people.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.837
Well, I mean, you know,
we were just giving it away anyway,

04:55.837 --> 04:57.714
so who cares?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.508
<i>- Who cares?
-</i>

05:02.218 --> 05:03.761
<i>Okay, Rafe, okay.</i>

05:04.929 --> 05:07.849
That's done for now.
I need you to finish the list I gave you.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.851
I want you to sign
for the East River property.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.686
When that's completed,
shut down the offices--

05:11.686 --> 05:14.689
Yeah, no, I-- Actually,
I wanted to talk to you about that.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.442
I'm thinking maybe
we should keep the offices.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.110
What?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.988
<i>Yeah, I'm thinking,
maybe I should stay down here for a while,</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:23.489
<i>really grow the company.</i>

05:23.489 --> 05:25.950
<i>- I think it'd be good for us, right?
-</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:31.080
- Listen to me, Rafe...
<i>-</i> No. No, no, you listen, okay?

05:31.831 --> 05:32.915
You listening?

05:32.915 --> 05:35.126
<i>You remember when you told me
to make myself useful?</i>

05:35.126 --> 05:38.004
<i>Well, that's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm making myself useful.</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:39.547
I can do shit, you know?

05:39.547 --> 05:43.634
Explore options,
so for the... for the benefit of all,

05:43.634 --> 05:46.637
I think I'm gonna hang out for a while, okay?

05:46.637 --> 05:49.891
Rafe, listen to me. You are there
for one reason and one reason only.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.269
You are to act as my proxy
to shut down the companies, okay?

05:53.269 --> 05:56.397
That is our one play. It's our only play.
And if you cannot do it--

05:56.397 --> 05:58.983
If I can't do it?
If I can't do it, then what? Then what?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.361
<i>You gonna hop on a plane? Come down here?</i>

06:01.361 --> 06:03.613
I mean, it'll be
like a goddamn Elvis sighting.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.281
Ward Cameron, everyone!

06:05.281 --> 06:08.368
<i>Oh my God, he lives!
He's back from the dead!</i>

06:15.958 --> 06:18.378
I got the family ring now, Pops.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.090
<i>Yeah, I'm wearing it,
and it's my time to step up, okay?</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:23.257
<i>You're dead.</i>

06:30.515 --> 06:34.602
Hey. There'll be
plenty of time to make it up to her.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.523
You're going to be hoeing that row
your whole life.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.816
Trust me, I know.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.777
Right now, we got bigger fish to fry.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.571
I don't like lying to her, Dad.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.409
Yeah. But El Dorado, kid.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.660
Eyes on the prize.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.496
And afterward, I'll make it up to her.
I promise.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.253
All right, who are we going to see?

07:01.003 --> 07:04.132
An old bud of mine from grad school.
Her name's Kelly Kepler.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.884
We took a trip down to Chichén Itzá
to the pyramids,

07:06.884 --> 07:08.469
camped out, got shit-faced.

07:08.469 --> 07:12.598
She went crazy for all things Mayan
once she saw the glyphs on the ball court,

07:12.598 --> 07:14.100
and maybe she can translate.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.770
Hey, be careful with that.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.399
What's going on here?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.821
- Eric, hey, it's John Routledge.
- Oh, hey... hey, John.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.656
Y'all are moving?

07:29.365 --> 07:30.616
Where's Dr. Kepler?

07:34.370 --> 07:36.789
- Dad, we should probably leave.
- What?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.584
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.004
- How did she pass?
-  A heart attack. Out of nowhere.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.007
I just can't stay here.
It's too many memories.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.427
That's tragic.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.053
So sorry to hear that.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.930
Nothing could kill Kepler.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.602
She'd just gotten back from an expedition,
made a major new discovery.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.395
What was that?

07:59.395 --> 08:00.730
A ruin in the jungle.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.107
South America somewhere.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.408
Do... do you know where exactly?

08:12.408 --> 08:13.993
No, she wouldn't tell me.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.830
The members of the expedition
swore to keep their location secret

08:17.830 --> 08:19.457
until they could publish.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.961
Can you give me any information?
When they left, who she was with?

08:23.961 --> 08:27.798
Yeah, the head of the expedition,
Professor Sowell.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.009
He lives nearby, not far from here.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.305
Wait, Dad.
I'm assuming you know this Sowell guy.

08:34.305 --> 08:37.475
- You know everybody on Kildare, right?
- He was my mentor.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.769
- He got me started on El Dorado.
-  Oh, perfect.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.063
So maybe he can help us
decipher this thing?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.315
There's a reason I didn't go to him first.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.735
Let's just say he wasn't real happy
when I left the program.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.287
He's a thief.
Why would he steal my money clip?

08:58.287 --> 09:00.540
But we're not gonna press charges
with him, right?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.250
Dad, please.

09:02.875 --> 09:07.213
Okay. No charges, but you're dropping
that little gangster JJ.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.339
Aren't you?

09:08.839 --> 09:09.799
I know.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.342
He stole.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.426
Good.

09:12.969 --> 09:13.928
I'm gonna back off.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.349
I'm... I'm proud of you, Kie.
This is the first step.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.142
You're starting to see more clearly.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.647
- Sarah?
- I got it.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.779
Hey, sorry, I don't mean to bother
if this is a bad time.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.114
- No, you're good.
- Okay.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.824
- Um...
- What's going on?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.619
John B and I kind of got
into, like, a little fight.

09:38.619 --> 09:42.081
Yeah, he's been acting so gripped
since his dad got back.

09:42.081 --> 09:46.961
Yeah, and basically, I don't have
anywhere to stay, and Rafe's at Tannyhill,

09:46.961 --> 09:50.756
and I was just wondering, like,
maybe I could stay here with you?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.467
- Yeah. Of course.
- Hey, hey. No.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.053
What did we talk about, Kie? Boundaries.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.556
Honey. Come on.
You got to try and respect our time.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.517
- We're trying to respect yours, right?
- Listen, Sarah, I'm sorry.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.686
You're always welcome here,
but come tomorrow.

10:03.686 --> 10:08.107
- Right now, we just need some family time.
- It's fine. Yeah. No, I understand.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.151
I'm sorry.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.945
Um,
I'll probably just hit up JJ or something.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.324
- Sorry.
-  I'll see you later.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.470
Hello?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.312
JJ?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
-  Sarah?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.502
What are you... What are you doing?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.504
Hi, Top.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.216
You look a little thirsty.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.969
If you want, there's beers right there.
You can grab a drink.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.684
Never thought
I'd be a beer cooler vagrant.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.852
That's embarrassing.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.230
Yeah, I thought you were more
into, like, high-end heists now.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.315
Like robbing trains, you know?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.735
- Sorry.
- Which... No judgment.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.029
- Um...
- I wouldn't blame you if you did.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.907
Listen, I know
your back's against it right now,

12:22.908 --> 12:27.788
and I can drop you at Tannyhill
and talk to Rafe on your behalf or not.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.165
- No.
- All right, okay.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.293
Um, yeah, where are you staying right now?

12:33.002 --> 12:33.836
Um...

12:35.337 --> 12:38.674
I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm not trying to be
up in your business or anything.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.884
- No, no.
- I...

12:40.885 --> 12:44.764
Look, I know you have a boyfriend,
and, um, I have a...

12:44.764 --> 12:47.057
I have a girlfriend now.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.228
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.105
You're surprised?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.315
Of course you do.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.400
Who?

12:56.984 --> 12:58.694
Um, you know, Elena.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.488
Reedy?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.573
You don't like her?

13:02.573 --> 13:04.450
No, it's just... I don't know.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.453
When we were together,
she was just always like up your ass.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.663
- It was just weird to me, and...
- Oh, you're jealous.

13:09.663 --> 13:13.000
- I'm not jealous.
- You're jealous. No, it's fine. I get it.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.504
She would just linger.
She was just always ready to pounce.

13:16.504 --> 13:21.091
Well, you left and broke up with me, so...

13:21.091 --> 13:23.010
Hey, yo, Top. What's up?

13:23.010 --> 13:24.136
Hey, man.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.721
- Holy shit.
-  Hi, Kelce.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.139
Is that Sarah Cameron?

13:28.432 --> 13:29.725
Bro, please tell me she's coming.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.604
- Where?
-  So we're all headed out to Mase.

13:33.604 --> 13:37.107
We're gonna, you know...
Kelce, Phebes, not Elena, by the way.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.902
Just going to do
a little surf and sun action,

13:39.902 --> 13:42.196
a little fellowship by the break, come on.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.364
You should come.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.826
- It'll be fun. It'll be good for you.
- Yeah, Sarah. Come on!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.160
Come on, Sarah.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.789
Please. I... I want you to come.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.751
Yeah?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.044
- Yeah.
-  That's a yes?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.087
Yeah.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.422
- Whoo! She's in!
-  Here we go!

14:04.635 --> 14:07.471
<i>♪ LSD and champagne
While I play Coltranе... ♪</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:13.310
Hey, Mrs. Hunter, I'm back,
and I'm ready to get right back on track.

14:13.310 --> 14:17.189
Now, I know I missed a little bit of time,
but I'm ready to kick it into warp drive,

14:17.189 --> 14:20.985
and I'm thinking we go
for the Vanderhorst Award again, Model UN.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.320
You know, something to help
me build back my résumé.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.240
I was already ahead.
Should be no problem getting back into it.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.784
Pope, you didn't just miss
a little bit of time.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.412
You missed 27 days of school.
That's almost six weeks.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.998
I'll take summer school.
I'll do whatever it takes.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.667
Pope, it's C-time.
Look, you don't have enough hours

14:36.667 --> 14:38.961
to legally advance
into the next school year.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.088
Even if you pass all the classes.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.134
- Then I'll just test out.
- Test out? Yeah, okay.

14:45.134 --> 14:50.472
Look, let's get to the world of possible.
And this is what's possible.

14:54.602 --> 14:58.147
These are all lower-level classes.
I took these my eighth-grade year.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.608
Yes, because the spots
in the higher-level classes

15:00.608 --> 15:04.194
are taken up by students
who didn't miss half the semester.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.908
Pope, I believe in you.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.952
All right? But you gotta
get back to being focused.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.628
So you all have
your celery in front of you,

15:20.628 --> 15:22.546
and you're seeing that process

15:23.297 --> 15:24.214
just like that.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.259
That's exactly
what's supposed to be happening.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.595
Hey, Pope. Where are you going?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.972
Excuse me, you need a bathroom pass.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.740
I'm back now, so I'll make it up.
I'll do anything.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.743
I'll scrub boats,
clean fish, pump fuel, anything.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.702
I'm your guy,

15:53.702 --> 15:55.162
except for the bathrooms,

15:55.162 --> 15:59.291
'cause, see, I got a condition,
like a gag reflex comes up.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.127
- Anything else, I'm your dude.
- I dunno, J.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.713
You do know, Billy. Come on. It's me, man.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.881
It's me.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.301
You know I got this.
All right? I'm your best bet.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.012
You see all those boats out there?
Those are Kook boats.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.597
The Kooks pay my bills.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.475
You and you and your friends
aren't exactly trusted by that crowd.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.895
Yeah, but they're the ones saying that.
You know that's bullshit, Billy.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.147
- Perception is reality, brother.
- Oh my God.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.401
And rumor has it,
along with everything else,

16:25.401 --> 16:27.361
you stole that catamaran out there.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.280
I didn't s-- I was with Sarah Cameron
when I was on that boat.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.158
- That's their family's boat!
- Not according to the registration.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.744
It's Rafe's boat,
and he says you stole it.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.414
He's keeping it here
because he doesn't want you around it.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.624
Okay, Billy, come on.
There's got to be something.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.419
I'm sorry, kid. Guffy put the nix on it.

16:43.419 --> 16:47.965
Okay? I can find cheap help
that doesn't piss my clients off.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.508
I gotta go.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.979
Damn, Rafe. Come on, Country Club.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.399
Bro, how are you gonna have this
and not even tell me!

17:05.399 --> 17:08.569
You got a whole damn YMCA
up on this bitch, dude.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.363
Barry! Time to think.
All right, we need to make a move.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.449
That's all we do, bro.
We been making moves.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.451
Yeah, well, we don't have much time.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.120
Come down here.
You're not gonna believe this shit.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.920
Yeah, right. You seen any buyers?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.131
It's always business with you, bro.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.884
I mean, I don't always live like this.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.680
I'm just saying
we need to take this shit seriously.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.975
Dude, bro. I should get
a tooth made out of this, huh?

17:39.975 --> 17:42.895
Look, don't be touching the shit.
Just put it back.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.647
-  So paranoid, bro.
-  I don't care about the cross.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.815
I'm trying to make money.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.193
I told you, my aunt,
she got some contacts.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.153
She gonna help us
move these little bitches.

17:51.153 --> 17:56.784
The gems, the nuggets,
the whole damn melted enchilada.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.286
These gems are mint, man.
The gold's bullion.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.579
We're selling it in bars.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.915
I'm not gonna deal
with some half-assed Pogue shit

18:02.915 --> 18:05.000
with some reject from Zales, bro.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.127
Watch how you speaking
about my auntie, dog.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.755
I'm not talking
about your aunt. I'm just...

18:10.923 --> 18:11.965
You did what?

18:12.508 --> 18:15.010
- Quit school.
- What about your scholarship?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.804
I lost it.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.516
I lost all my old classes.
I'll be lucky if I even passed the grade.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.976
My transcript is ass.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.271
Everything I had going for me, gone.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.607
And do you know why I'm screwed?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.609
Because I tried to do the right thing.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.196
I tried to help John B with his treasure,
to get my family's inheritance back,

18:34.196 --> 18:35.781
and you know what I got for it?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.409
- Kicked in the dirt. It's over. I'm done.
-  Pope!

18:39.409 --> 18:41.870
Pope, it's not like
you can just give up like that.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.414
Yo! Bombshell.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.127
What's going on? What happened?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.962
Detecting a real heavy vibe.
What's going on?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.630
Pope's quitting school.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.425
- Being a coroner's kind of weird anyway.
- Shut up, wrench dick.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.095
Right, great.
So it's definitely not the time for this.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.013
- Okay, shit.
- What?

19:00.013 --> 19:03.308
So I was down at Guffy's, all right.
I was trying to get my job back.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.811
And I see the catty
across the way, and on it...

19:05.811 --> 19:07.813
...is Rafe and Barry.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.691
I sneak over to hear
what they're talking about.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.901
Pope, he has the cross.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.697
And he melted it down.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.077
I'm sorry, bro.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.496
All right.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.542
I know. I know.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.462
Fuck!

19:36.008 --> 19:37.467
Of course, it was Rafe.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.470
Yeah, I mean,
we probably could've guessed that.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.931
The Cross of Santo Domingo, desecrated!

19:43.932 --> 19:45.601
For money? God!

19:45.601 --> 19:47.311
I know, so...

19:47.311 --> 19:50.606
I think we need to stay calm
to make a plan, but we got to stay--

19:52.691 --> 19:54.234
Getting better at that.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.530
This is messed up, man.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.074
- Even for them.
-  I know.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.743
Couldn't agree more, man.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.870
They're just gonna
keep getting away with it.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.206
They're gonna keep doing that shit.
Gonna keep winning.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.041
I mean, Pope, is that news to you?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.295
No.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.674
But I'm sick of being the good guy.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.261
- Pope.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.888
Pope, where are you going?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.442
All right, so what's
this guy got against you, Dad?

20:35.442 --> 20:36.818
Nothing.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.906
Except I refused to be
a cog in a corrupt academic system.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.910
Right. So you, what?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.703
Wised up, went out into the world,

20:46.703 --> 20:49.164
and stuck it to the Man
by slowly starving yourself?

20:49.164 --> 20:53.502
Hey, we may strike it big yet, wise ass.
We got the idol, don't we?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.213
Sowell here is the foremost expert
on pre-Columbian glyphs

20:56.213 --> 20:57.798
in at least three states.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.924
Shit.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.177
He was a real stickler about everything,
especially his lawn.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.597
Lawn freak. Cool.
So weird you guys didn't get along.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.480
Hey, Dad, why don't we come back
when he's actually here?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.942
It's all right. Look at this place.
Something ain't right.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.278
He could be in trouble. We should check.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.489
Remember the last time we started
poking around other people's houses?

21:22.489 --> 21:23.865
Vaguely.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.910
Vaguely, yeah.
That didn't go so well, did it?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.413
Hey, can we just think
about this for a minute?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.792
Just a quick minute-long conversation.
That would be great, Dad.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.920
- Dad.
-  Hey.

21:37.504 --> 21:41.842
Only way out is through, kid. Come on.
Straight on till we hit pay dirt.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.803
Tommy, you in here? Professor.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.849
- Hello?

21:48.849 --> 21:49.933
Anybody home?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.773
Anybody home?

21:57.566 --> 21:58.442
Tommy?

21:59.568 --> 22:00.444
Dad.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.696
This is... this is strange.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.948
Sowell would never keep
his place like this.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.492
John B, come on.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.744
Hey.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.371
Check back there.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.555
No, no, no, hey! Whoa! Chill.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.808
What the hell? Hey! Hey!

22:31.808 --> 22:34.186
- I'm so sorry.
- What the hell's going on?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.355
-  Sowell, Dad, Sowell.
- Tommy?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.564
- Tommy!

22:37.564 --> 22:40.525
Whoa.
It's me, Johnny Routledge.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.028
I'm your student. Remember?

22:46.823 --> 22:47.908
Routledge is dead.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.745
I'm not dead.
Look, here I am in the flesh.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.790
Big John, your greatest failure, remember?

22:54.790 --> 22:56.458
Youthful promise squandered,

22:56.458 --> 22:59.127
brilliant beginnings
ending in disaster, et cetera.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.213
- Oh yeah. In Mexico.
- Remember that time I left you--

23:01.213 --> 23:03.715
On the Mayan dig. How could I forget?

23:04.716 --> 23:06.343
We had mechanical...

23:06.343 --> 23:08.428
- You abandoned us.
-  Abandoned?

23:08.428 --> 23:10.055
That's a strong word.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.390
My CB radio went out.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.850
There was complications
and unexpected potholes.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.020
Yeah, now it's all coming back
to me.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.855
The excuses.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.984
- You are Routledge.
- Yes.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.321
And this...
this is my son, John B.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.907
Hey, sorry about that, Dr. Sowell.

23:29.825 --> 23:34.121
What's with, uh, the get-up, Tommy?
You expecting the Sun God?

23:34.121 --> 23:36.456
I thought someone was breaking in.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.834
I had to protect myself somehow.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.045
Divert and attack,
it worked for the Mayans.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.966
Sorry about the... big entrance.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.177
I thought you were someone else.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.767
-<i>♪ I been on my lonesome... ♪</i>

23:55.767 --> 23:56.893
Yo!

23:57.894 --> 24:00.730
-  Anything official?
-  It's not official.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.483
I swear you had
the biggest crush on Topper last time,

24:03.483 --> 24:05.819
and now it's his best friend.
I cannot keep up.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.863
- Hi.
- Hey.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.865
Get some, Topper!

24:09.865 --> 24:11.992
Oh my God. I would die.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.618
I'll give you that.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.037
Normally, we don't have
the same taste, but Topper...

24:16.037 --> 24:18.915
- Hey, man. You're shredding it out there.
- Thanks, man.

24:18.915 --> 24:23.420
I don't mean to pry,
but were you really on a deserted island?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.297
Yeah, for a month.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.592
Holy shit.
The only plus side is no parents, right?

24:28.592 --> 24:29.759
No school?

24:29.759 --> 24:32.304
Okay, but you were with your boyfriend,
so it makes up for this.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.930
My God, y'all, come on, relax.

24:33.930 --> 24:37.434
You're just drilling her with questions.
Like the gestapo over here.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.936
Just maybe give her
a little room to breathe? Okay?

24:39.936 --> 24:42.647
Hey, Sarah,
I, uh, really wanna show you something.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.815
Right now?

24:43.815 --> 24:46.067
Yeah, if that's cool.
I think you'll like it.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.068
Yeah.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.363
- I'll be right back.
<i>-</i> No, you're good. Have fun.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.366
Relax with the questions.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.702
- It's no biggie.
- Were they okay?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.331
Yeah. Why wouldn't they be?

25:00.207 --> 25:03.710
- 'Cause they're totally jealous of you.
- Me? Homeless?

25:03.710 --> 25:05.712
Listen, let me break this down.

25:05.712 --> 25:10.091
You, Sarah Cameron,
have lived this adventure already.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.719
You were on a deserted island.

25:12.719 --> 25:16.181
That's insane! They're jealous,
I'm jealous, everyone is jealous of you.

25:16.181 --> 25:20.644
Like, how did you eat,
sleep, shower? Like...

25:21.228 --> 25:23.563
I don't know. I have so many questions.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.857
I dunno, it's so cool to me.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.318
Poguelandia.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.531
Poguelandia?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.615
Poguelandia.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.952
That's what we called it. JJ named it.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.455
I wanted to take a vote,
but Poguelandia just stuck.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.543
- He made a flag with a chicken on it...

25:44.543 --> 25:46.795
...in a coconut bra, smoking a joint,

25:47.796 --> 25:51.216
and, uh, we speared for fish every day.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.926
And Cleo nearly lost a toe,

25:53.635 --> 25:56.137
and then Pope found out
that you can make bandages

25:56.137 --> 25:58.932
out of fig leaves, so he did that for her,

25:58.932 --> 26:03.436
and then, um, of course,
Kie knows all about leaves and herbs

26:03.436 --> 26:05.647
and plants and shit, and...

26:08.233 --> 26:09.568
we survived together.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.407
What about John B?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.411
He was there.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.331
Sorry.
You don't need to talk about it.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.457
No. No.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.501
Just want you to have a fun day.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.628
Worry-free zone here, Sarah.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.215
But, um, see that?
That's where we're going.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.092
- There?
-  Yeah.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.468
You ready?

26:35.468 --> 26:38.096
- Let's get on the boat. Come on.
-  Okay.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.181
<i>♪ Girl, you got me automatic ♪</i>

26:42.017 --> 26:44.102
- You got it?
- Maybe. Oh my God.

26:44.936 --> 26:45.937
Whoo!

26:45.937 --> 26:47.981
-  This is incredible.
-  Right?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.149
Oh my God.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.151
Be careful. Let's take a seat.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.571
- Not too shabby.
- This is crazy.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.990
Right? Yeah.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.452
I didn't even know you could get up here.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.122
No, I mean, uh, I know
it's no deserted island or anything,

27:04.122 --> 27:07.208
but it's pretty... pretty cool, right?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.218
I'm... I'm glad I got to show you this.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.555
Me too.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.646
Well, I appreciate the help, you two.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.689
I ain't missing Mrs. Heyward's cooking.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.275
Unlike my derelict son.
He's usually here by now.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.028
I'm sure
he'll be back any second, Mrs. Heyward.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.614
Either one of y'all moved
the pistol from in there?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.449
The one I keep under the register?

27:40.533 --> 27:43.620
- JJ?
- Whoa, okay. I didn't touch it. Okay?

27:43.620 --> 27:45.205
Yeah, well, somebody did.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.540
- 'Cause it's gone.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.750
Wasn't me.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.795
You see? I-- Dang it. I gotta find it.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.757
All right, I'm sure it's somewhere.
Heyward, I'm sure it's somewhere.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.842
- It's him.
-  Yeah, he's going after Rafe.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.595
- I'll check Tannyhill.
- I'll take the marina.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.686
You seem a little jumpy there, doc.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.522
You'd be jumpy too if you were me.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.607
I took a trip

28:12.607 --> 28:14.150
last year,

28:14.734 --> 28:17.946
uh, in the mountains in Venezuela.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.572
The Orinoco River Basin.

28:20.156 --> 28:23.201
- Yeah, that's right.
- Solana, the site of the signpost?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.370
You told him.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.834
Where is that site exactly?

28:31.418 --> 28:35.422
There were five of us who found this site.
Since we've been back, three have died.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.008
- Just two of us are left.
- We were just at Kepler's.

28:39.008 --> 28:42.470
They said it was a heart attack.
She ran triathlons. Give me a break.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.014
We are being targeted to silence us.

28:45.014 --> 28:47.392
You should both just go for your own sake.

28:47.392 --> 28:52.897
Yeah, well, we heard about this.
It's kind of reason we're here, see.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.568
- No, no, no, no.
-  Yeah, yeah.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.237
I dunno what that is,
but I don't wanna see it.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.407
Oh, yeah, I think you do. So why don't you

29:03.324 --> 29:06.244
just take a second and look at it?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.625
Come on, Tommy.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.962
You remember
why I ended up abandoning the PhD.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.547
The Review Committee accused me

29:17.547 --> 29:21.134
of being obsessed with suspect
conspiracy theories about El Dorado.

29:21.134 --> 29:25.597
Well, they're not so suspect now.
Even my harshest critic is won over.

29:25.597 --> 29:30.685
Yeah, I thought it was all fantasy.
Delusional dad. And then we found this.

29:44.699 --> 29:48.328
- That's the Gnomon of Solana.
- Hey, you said it. I didn't.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.788
I thought it was destroyed.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.791
No, split in half,
separated, not destroyed.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.833
Now whole again.

29:54.709 --> 29:55.919
This is incredible.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.047
You found it.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.258
-  This is the missing piece.

30:02.258 --> 30:06.429
We just need to find out where to put it.
And I think you know.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.932
Professor,
you called it the Gnomon of Solana.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.851
What, uh... what is a gnomon?

30:11.851 --> 30:13.770
It's a stick
that casts a shadow,

30:13.770 --> 30:16.064
like the spike of a sundial.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.025
The shadow gives lots of information,
the time of day, the time of month.

30:19.025 --> 30:22.695
Legend has it
that if it's put in its proper place

30:22.695 --> 30:26.366
and viewed at exactly the right time,
it can give a clue or directions to...

30:26.366 --> 30:28.201
- El Dorado.
- El Dorado.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.497
- Okay.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.843
What... what is happening?

30:47.554 --> 30:51.349
John, you need to walk away from this.

30:51.349 --> 30:55.061
I know that I sparked an interest
in this subject in you and Kepler,

30:55.061 --> 30:56.396
but look what it got us.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.856
There are forces here.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.859
I just need to know
where Solana is and what the glyphs say.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.361
- Then we'll be on our way.
- You don't understand.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.574
-  Tommy.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.908
Tommy, what's it say?

31:08.908 --> 31:11.327
You know what they say.
You're reading them.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.163
- Hey! What's it say? Don't hold out on me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

31:14.163 --> 31:16.040
- Stop!
- Okay, I'll tell you.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.209
Just sit down. Let him do his job.

31:21.087 --> 31:24.299
Okay, so here's
the Solana site and the temalacatl.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.427
You put the gnomon here.
It asks a question.

31:27.427 --> 31:28.636
Uh-huh.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.346
- The gnomon--

31:31.389 --> 31:33.349
What... What the...

31:33.349 --> 31:35.894
The gnomon... the gnomon what, Tommy?

31:35.894 --> 31:38.521
- The gnomon what?

31:39.105 --> 31:41.316
- What is that?
- Kalinago.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.901
Get down!

31:42.901 --> 31:44.736
- Holy shit. Go!

31:44.736 --> 31:45.945
No! No!

31:49.365 --> 31:51.534
Go, go, go!

31:57.874 --> 32:00.418
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.464
- Shh, shh, shh.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.716
Stay silent, stay still. Okay, Bird?

32:14.349 --> 32:15.975
There it is.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.393
Shh.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.026
Got it.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.196
-  Check the house for the other two.
- Dad, what are you doing?

32:28.696 --> 32:30.990
-  Hold up, hold up.
- You trust me, right?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.910
- Yeah.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.038
Okay, I'm gonna go find the gnomon.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.296
John B, help the professor.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.730
-  Make sure you clear the basement.
-  Copy. I'm gonna check back here.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.982
Okay.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.198
Professor?

33:21.624 --> 33:23.334
Neville.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.377
Who's...

33:25.336 --> 33:26.963
Neville? What does that mean?

33:43.104 --> 33:45.023
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.692
John B, run!

33:48.985 --> 33:50.361
Dad, Dad!

33:50.361 --> 33:54.574
John B!

33:54.574 --> 33:56.492
Stay down, or I'll shoot.

33:57.869 --> 34:02.790
I wanted to thank you, John,
for finding the other half of the gnomon.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.461
Despite all your faults,
you are resourceful, you know.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.380
Almost makes up for you
stealing from me in the beginning.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.551
- Finish him.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.470
Hold on a sec! Hang on.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.931
Hang on now.
How you gonna translate that idol, huh?

34:20.016 --> 34:23.061
'Cause if you're thinking that's Mayan,
it's not. It's Kalinago.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.981
And no one has
ever fully translated Kalinago, okay?

34:26.981 --> 34:28.066
You know that.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.277
I'm the only person alive
who can translate that thing.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.280
You just killed the other one.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.325
You kill me, you kill
any chance of ever finding El Dorado.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.662
So, unless you're sure
that you got it figured out,

34:43.247 --> 34:44.874
I wouldn't ice me just yet.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.261
Take him to the boat.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.264
-  No! Dad!
- John B, I'm coming. I'm coming.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.724
Bring me the boy.

35:01.724 --> 35:04.310
No! Let him go.
He's got nothing to do with this!

35:04.310 --> 35:05.645
-  Dad!
-  Come on.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.025
I'll translate the idol!
Let him go, Singh!

35:11.609 --> 35:14.362
- Just let him go. John B!

35:15.530 --> 35:16.614
The loose end,

35:17.198 --> 35:18.699
John Booker Routledge.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.289
Your father will join me
on the great quest,

35:25.289 --> 35:28.668
and you will have
the privilege of dying in the old way.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.254
- Go.
- No.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.380
Move.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.548
Please. Singh.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.050
Hey, no. Singh! No!

35:36.050 --> 35:37.552
No!

35:37.552 --> 35:40.054
- Please! No! Singh!

35:46.435 --> 35:48.646
One more, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

36:57.340 --> 37:00.885
Sarah, do you think things
would have been a little different

37:01.427 --> 37:03.679
if I hadn't fought
that night at the Boneyard?

37:03.679 --> 37:05.014
What do you mean?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.434
Wait.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.731
- What do you mean?
- I, um...

37:18.653 --> 37:20.154
You know, I was jealous.

37:20.154 --> 37:26.369
And I don't mind admitting it now,
but I was... just madly in love with you.

37:27.370 --> 37:31.082
And... and that... made me a little crazy.

37:33.626 --> 37:36.796
- I obviously hate crazy.
- No, it...

37:37.922 --> 37:40.466
Sarah, I did things that I regret.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.301
I'm...

37:43.719 --> 37:44.720
I'm so sorry.

37:47.515 --> 37:51.018
And, um, at the end of the day,
I just want you to be happy.

You know, Mr. Singh,

38:53.247 --> 38:56.000
I can't just read
this thing like a newspaper.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.710
It's complicated. I--

38:57.710 --> 39:00.463
It could take me a week
to translate one of these glyphs.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.089
Well, good thing for you,

39:02.089 --> 39:04.550
we have a week
before we reach the Orinoco,

39:04.550 --> 39:07.887
and if you can't translate it
before we reach the site,

39:07.887 --> 39:09.722
I'll know you can't do it.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.725
If you do translate it, you'll live.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.810
If you can't, you'll die.

39:20.733 --> 39:21.942
Yeah. Hey, brother.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.987
I haven't talked to you in a minute,
all right?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.657
No, look, listen.
Okay, the situation is we got...

39:28.657 --> 39:31.410
I got it. I got it right here.
It's bars, in bullion.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.495
All right.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.998
I got the gems, all right?
They're mint, okay?

39:38.709 --> 39:41.962
Yeah, I know. We talked
about this shit earlier. I know.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.634
You sure you want to do that?

39:48.135 --> 39:49.845
It's gonna feel real nice.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.515
Only for a second.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.103
I don't care.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.106
Care about your mother.

40:00.731 --> 40:01.732
And your father.

40:03.609 --> 40:04.985
What would they think?

40:06.487 --> 40:09.115
I think they would understand how I feel.

40:12.201 --> 40:16.372
For once, he would lose like we always do.

40:19.083 --> 40:19.917
Yeah.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.169
It doesn't matter anyway.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.005
I've lost everything.

40:28.884 --> 40:30.010
Are you joking me?

40:33.389 --> 40:34.557
You have a family.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.184
And a home.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.022
And friends
that would take a bullet for you.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.734
I'd give anything
to have the things you have.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.239
You got a lot to lose
before you have nothing.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.582
Just let it go.

41:03.002 --> 41:03.919
Just...

41:05.963 --> 41:06.922
Just breathe.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.055
Just let it go.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.185
I got you.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.656
You're gonna be okay.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.326
Thank you.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.286
Good night.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.663
Night.

42:59.535 --> 43:00.411
And...

43:01.787 --> 43:04.582
- Stretched the truth a little bit.
- Yeah, that's called lying.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.708
Yeah, I know.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.920
- John B, what's going on?
- My dad killed two guys.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.136
- He was trying to protect me.
-  No, no, no. Hold on, okay?

43:19.096 --> 43:20.472
- You serious?
-  Yes.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.934
It was the guys from the Coastal Venture.

43:23.934 --> 43:26.562
They came here looking
for Denmark's diary.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.815
- Your dad capped them for that.
- Yes, and then Singh showed up.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.192
They took my dad,
and then they tried to kill me.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.694
They took him to South America.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.487
- Whoa, South America?
- They're on their way.

43:35.487 --> 43:37.281
- Okay, hold on.
- Then what? Off him?

43:37.281 --> 43:39.366
- I don't know what to do.
- John B, stop!

43:41.827 --> 43:43.370
Just breathe for a second.

43:46.915 --> 43:48.083
I need to think.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.653
I don't know what to do, JJ.

44:18.405 --> 44:20.491
How the hell do we get to South America?

44:27.206 --> 44:28.040
No clue.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.502
But...

44:34.838 --> 44:36.340
we're gonna figure it out.

44:37.091 --> 44:37.966
Yeah.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.218
