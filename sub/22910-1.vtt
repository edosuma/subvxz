02:22.017 --> 02:24.100
Come on.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.844
Hush.

06:25.385 --> 06:30.926
It can at the same time
be both a particle and a wave,

06:31.766 --> 06:36.352
depending on the measuring
apparatus we use.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.191
<i>- Hi, Mum.
- Hi.</i>

06:50.201 --> 06:54.946
<i>- Hey, is anything wrong?
- No, I'm just at home, reading.</i>

06:54.956 --> 06:58.415
<i>I see. We've been trying to call you.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:01.536
Yes, I know, but I was at a lecture.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.584
<i>Oh? What lecture?</i>

07:05.550 --> 07:10.295
<i>Biology started today. I meant
to call you back, but I was too busy.</i>

07:10.305 --> 07:12.638
Isn't that in the morning?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.597
<i>- What do you mean?
- I thought that was at eight.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:18.595
- It's Tuesday morning, right?
- Yes.

07:19.898 --> 07:24.359
Daddy showed me how
to keep track of everything online.

07:24.361 --> 07:29.231
<i>- Well, it was moved to six just this week.
- OK.</i>

07:30.033 --> 07:33.117
But, hey, I'm cooking dinner, so...

07:33.119 --> 07:35.953
What are you making?

07:35.956 --> 07:40.542
<i>- Just some pasta and stuff.
- OK. Right.</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:46.331
<i>- But we can talk later.
- How about tomorrow?</i>

07:46.341 --> 07:48.924
<i>- Sure.
- Yes.</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:52.796
<i>- OK. We love you.
- Love you too.</i>

07:52.806 --> 07:56.425
<i>- OK. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

09:29.194 --> 09:30.401
Hello?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.730
Hello? Hey!

09:37.285 --> 09:39.743
Can someone call an ambulance?

09:46.169 --> 09:48.377
Had it been a while since you ate?

09:50.465 --> 09:52.548
No, not really.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.002
Had you been drinking?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.805
Alcohol?

09:59.808 --> 10:03.472
- No, I don't really drink.
- Don't really?

10:03.478 --> 10:07.813
- No, I don't drink.
- You've never experienced it before?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.058
No.

10:10.068 --> 10:14.904
- Is it epilepsy?
- It's too early to tell.

10:14.906 --> 10:20.322
- Do you have a family history of epilepsy?
- No, not that I know of.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.866
I should look at your medical record.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.740
Can I call your family doctor back home?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.248
No, I'd rather you didn't.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.372
I don't want my parents
to know about this.

10:32.382 --> 10:36.968
They don't have to know.
I'll just talk to your doctor.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.132
It's up to you if you want to tell them.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.427
Well, OK.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.101
Could it be serious?

10:46.104 --> 10:49.643
The tests don't show anything abnormal.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.393
We'll take some more tests later on
to exclude certain conditions.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.104
Meanwhile, try not to think about it.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.032
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.414
Hey, I just wanted to say hello.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.539
I was in the reading hall

14:01.549 --> 14:05.543
when you had some sort of...

14:05.553 --> 14:08.011
- Anyway, I'm Anja.
- Thelma.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.558
- But... Are you feeling better?
- Much better.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.302
Great.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.684
- Are you also studying chemistry?
- No, biology.

14:26.407 --> 14:31.368
- Good. OK, maybe I'll see you in maths.
- Yeah.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.618
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.740
- It's in here.
- Here?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.491
Right.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.655
But whenever
someone mentions it, you...

15:49.657 --> 15:51.068
I don't know what you mean.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.820
- I remember Sofia and Gunnar's father.
- Aksel.

15:55.830 --> 15:59.414
Yes. Sofia and I
were going to summer camp.

15:59.417 --> 16:05.254
He started talking about how fossils were
the result of the great flood.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.715
You didn't say much,
just put an end to the conversation.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.428
Marthe's parents too, they...

16:13.431 --> 16:18.017
We met Marthe at the mall.
Was it last week?

16:18.019 --> 16:21.763
- She sends her regards.
- That's nice.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.559
They're very nice.

16:23.566 --> 16:28.311
But they believe the Earth
was created 6,000 years ago.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.110
At one time,
there was this documentary...

16:32.116 --> 16:34.403
That's enough, Thelma.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.533
Don't make fun of people.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.199
I didn't mean to, I just...

16:42.210 --> 16:44.452
Don't you agree it's strange?

16:46.214 --> 16:48.581
I'm not sure I like this new attitude.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.166
What do you mean?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.716
A little knowledge doesn't
make us better than others.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.263
How did life come to be
where there was no life?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.185
Do you know?

17:13.406 --> 17:14.897
No.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.569
You talk as if you know everything.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.036
I know I don't.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.660
- Are you feeling sad?
- Yes, a little.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.671
Want to sit here a while?

18:26.147 --> 18:28.104
What's the matter?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.061
I'm sorry, Daddy.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.908
I don't know what's wrong with me.

18:39.910 --> 18:43.745
Sometimes I think I'm better than others.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.660
And I know I'm not.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.034
But I can't help it.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.207
I'm glad you say so.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.797
Anything else?

18:59.138 --> 19:05.430
It's just when I see girls with friends and
boyfriends, they seem uglier than me.

19:05.436 --> 19:09.601
And they say stupid things.
I don't know why they...

19:14.654 --> 19:18.398
I see you're getting
new friends on Facebook.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.444
- Yes.
- Well?

19:27.375 --> 19:29.833
What's the matter?

19:29.835 --> 19:34.250
Well, I talk to some of them before lectures
and so on, but it stops there.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.251
Seems everyone knows a lot of people
already. I don't.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.095
But they have to get to know you.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.596
You're a great person.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.726
Thank you.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.690
It'll just take some time.

20:11.252 --> 20:15.713
We'll call you when we get home.
Take care.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.628
- See you soon.
- Have a nice trip.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.351
- Hi!
- Hi!

21:54.438 --> 21:56.930
How nice to see you!
Are you leaving, or...

21:56.941 --> 22:01.356
No, I was supposed to meet someone,
but it looks like they've left.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.071
- Hi.
- This is Julie.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.190
I'm Julie.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.655
Is that just a Coke?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.195
Yeah.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.744
That's it? Just a Coke?

22:14.750 --> 22:18.164
- Yeah.
- May I ask why?

22:19.255 --> 22:21.042
My family's Christian.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.587
- That's how I was raised.
- Really?

22:24.593 --> 22:27.677
Diehard Christian?
I mean, ordinary Christian?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.638
- Yeah.
- Well, that's cool.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.101
Exotic. I just...

22:35.938 --> 22:41.559
Because... Honestly,
I think that religious faith is a bit odd.

22:41.569 --> 22:46.280
"Why?"
"Well, because God or Allah..."

22:46.282 --> 22:48.524
- Or Santa Claus.
- "Santa says that's how it is."

22:48.534 --> 22:52.904
"Santa says birth control is wrong.
Let's just have 14 kids."

22:53.956 --> 22:57.791
"Santa says
women must cover their faces."

22:57.793 --> 22:59.580
I don't get it. I think it's weird.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.170
- Don't you believe in anything?
- No.

23:02.172 --> 23:08.419
Only stuff that you can explain,
that has a scientific explanation.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.342
Can you explain
how your mobile works?

23:13.934 --> 23:18.770
- Right... What do you mean?
- Well, how does it work?

23:18.772 --> 23:24.643
- It's not just because someone says so.
- Well, there are signals, like...

23:24.653 --> 23:26.690
What kind of signals?

23:26.697 --> 23:30.941
Well, it's not God. I know that for sure.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.819
But signals that are like...

23:33.829 --> 23:36.537
Help me if I'm completely...

23:36.540 --> 23:39.408
But it's in that area, like... radiation.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.035
- Radiation!
- But it is!

23:42.046 --> 23:47.587
That's why it gives you cancer.
Radiation, that's the explanation.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.350
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.</i>

24:46.360 --> 24:48.317
Sorry for calling so late.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.063
<i>- My phone was in silent mode.
- OK.</i>

24:51.073 --> 24:53.656
<i>- Is everything OK?
- Yes.</i>

24:53.659 --> 24:55.946
<i>It's just your mother.</i>

24:55.953 --> 24:57.910
<i>She gets nervous
when you don't answer.</i>

24:57.913 --> 25:00.200
Yes, I know. Sorry.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.870
<i>She's been feeling very down again.</i>

25:02.876 --> 25:05.493
<i>She's in a lot of pain, you know.</i>

25:07.631 --> 25:09.839
<i>Where are you? Are you outside?</i>

25:10.801 --> 25:13.760
Yes. I've been out with some friends.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.797
I had a lot of fun.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.095
<i>Right.</i>

25:20.102 --> 25:23.641
<i>I'm glad you're having fun.
Just be careful.</i>

25:23.647 --> 25:25.639
I am.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.643
<i>OK. We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

25:29.653 --> 25:32.020
<i>I love you.</i>

25:32.031 --> 25:34.239
I love you too.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.655
Say hello to Mum, and tell her I'm sorry.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.653
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:43.574
OK. Good night.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.372
<i>- Good night. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

28:02.681 --> 28:03.762
Hi.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.300
Hi.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.323
Thelma?

28:36.006 --> 28:38.043
Thelma?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.634
Thelma?

29:10.415 --> 29:12.577
Do you want to call someone?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.667
No, not now.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.424
I'm sorry.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.804
For what? Don't think about it.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.360
Are you tired?

29:41.363 --> 29:43.104
Yeah.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.935
- Hey.
- Yeah?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.524
Why did you turn up here last night?

31:02.527 --> 31:03.984
Didn't you text me?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.487
No, I don't think so.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.786
No...

31:17.793 --> 31:19.750
Did you know where I live?

31:21.671 --> 31:24.004
I must have.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.420
I've probably told you.

31:27.552 --> 31:32.422
I got pretty drunk yesterday.
I hardly remember anything.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.508
...from the extreme value theorem,
as this...

32:34.578 --> 32:37.412
A simple application of the theorem...

33:01.104 --> 33:06.270
I remember how Dad once held my hand
over a lit candle.

33:08.195 --> 33:13.907
He pulled it away just before I got burned.
But it was really painful.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.196
Then he said...

33:16.870 --> 33:19.988
"Remember, this is what it's like in Hell,
all the time."

33:22.334 --> 33:24.417
Are you kidding?

33:26.922 --> 33:30.211
Are you... Aren't you angry with him?

33:30.217 --> 33:32.709
No. Or...

33:32.719 --> 33:34.551
It's a long time ago.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.305
He's actually very kind.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.512
OK!

33:44.523 --> 33:48.142
I mean it. He's really nice.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.855
I can talk about everything with him.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.529
You talk about everything with your dad?

33:54.533 --> 33:57.276
Yeah. Shouldn't I?

33:59.162 --> 34:03.076
Well, I think I've talked to my dad like...

34:03.083 --> 34:05.200
ten times.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.167
Shit.

34:10.172 --> 34:14.543
He lives abroad. Has loads of kids.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.545
Though I'm not sure he likes children.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.384
But are you angry with him?

34:29.275 --> 34:31.233
I think I was, for a while.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.360
But the older I get,

34:34.364 --> 34:38.404
the less I feel I need him
in my life, so...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.860
it's no problem.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.407
"Jesus turd"?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.873
- No!
- No, maybe that doesn't cut it.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.373
"Jesus cunt"?

34:51.422 --> 34:55.963
The worst what?
What do you mean, the worst?

34:55.969 --> 35:01.806
The worst thing you can say
if you're a Christian, like.

35:05.520 --> 35:10.732
If you combine what's holy
with what's less holy.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.147
"Jesus Sa..."

35:14.029 --> 35:17.443
- What did you just say?
- "Jesus Sat..."

35:18.074 --> 35:21.533
- A little louder.
- "Jesus Satan".

35:21.536 --> 35:25.826
- Why are you whispering?
- "Jesus Satan"!

35:35.925 --> 35:37.882
You've got one there as well.

35:39.012 --> 35:42.221
I've got them everywhere.

35:44.267 --> 35:47.681
- A man?
- Yeah.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.430
The world's tiniest man.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.228
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.692
- You OK?
- Guess I need practice.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.194
You don't have to smoke.
We can go inside.

37:08.435 --> 37:12.896
- Thank you for inviting me along.
- My pleasure.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.640
I'm glad you could make it.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.892
It's always nice to meet Anja's friends.

37:19.571 --> 37:25.192
- Have you been here before?
- No, I haven't. It's really beautiful.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.864
Let's see... I think it's this way.

37:47.724 --> 37:51.718
- Here, have a snack.
- What is it?

37:51.728 --> 37:54.971
It's one of those food bars.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.565
- I don't feel like chocolate.
- You haven't eaten.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.608
I'm OK. I don't need anything.

38:14.667 --> 38:18.377
Hey, why couldn't Daniel come?

38:18.379 --> 38:21.122
I broke up with him.

38:21.132 --> 38:25.217
- Shit! What happened?
- Don't tell Mum. She really liked him.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.797
- But are you OK?
- I'm fine.

43:07.376 --> 43:10.460
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

43:10.463 --> 43:12.546
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

43:12.548 --> 43:15.962
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.085
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.759
Lord, save me from these thoughts.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.722
Please, I beg you. Take them away.

43:25.978 --> 43:29.142
<i>- Has it been a long day?
- Yes.</i>

43:31.734 --> 43:34.442
<i>Do you manage to get some rest
when you come home?</i>

43:35.780 --> 43:37.567
Yes.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.742
<i>Do you make dinner regularly,
or do you eat takeaway?</i>

43:42.912 --> 43:45.700
I mostly make dinner here.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.873
<i>What did you have today?</i>

43:52.380 --> 43:54.838
I made vegetable soup today.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.718
<i>Do you go shopping down there?</i>

44:02.181 --> 44:03.922
Yes.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.852
<i>What's the matter, Thelma?</i>

44:11.649 --> 44:13.606
Nothing.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.774
<i>I can always tell when there's something.</i>

44:24.745 --> 44:26.486
I...

44:28.499 --> 44:30.240
I...

44:32.837 --> 44:36.205
<i>You can always tell me, you know.
It's important that you do.</i>

44:39.010 --> 44:41.218
I've drunk alcohol.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.303
And I'm very sorry I did.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.480
<i>How much?</i>

44:59.822 --> 45:03.065
Just two beers with some friends.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.788
<i>Was that the day you didn't call us
until late in the evening?</i>

45:19.133 --> 45:20.874
Yes.

45:34.315 --> 45:36.056
<i>Right.</i>

45:38.736 --> 45:40.728
<i>Maybe it's all right.</i>

45:43.324 --> 45:46.408
<i>You're an adult now.
Need to make your own experiences.</i>

45:51.499 --> 45:53.456
<i>Maybe one beer isn't that bad.</i>

46:00.299 --> 46:03.167
<i>Just make sure you don't
lose touch with who you are.</i>

46:07.348 --> 46:09.305
No. I know.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.894
<i>- I won't.
- Many people drink too much.</i>

46:15.481 --> 46:17.438
<i>It's very easy to lose control.</i>

46:19.527 --> 46:21.314
Yes.

46:22.697 --> 46:26.065
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.</i>

46:26.075 --> 46:28.112
<i>It's all right, Thelma.</i>

46:29.412 --> 46:33.747
<i>Don't worry about it.
I'm glad you told me.</i>

46:35.293 --> 46:38.536
<i>- Try to get some sleep.
- Yes.</i>

46:42.842 --> 46:46.210
<i>- OK, we'll talk later.
- Yes. Take care.</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:48.303
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

47:00.234 --> 47:06.652
<i>The power that conquered death</i>

47:08.200 --> 47:15.164
<i>Lives on in those who are His</i>

47:15.166 --> 47:19.911
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

47:19.920 --> 47:23.163
<i>In honour and in glory</i>

47:23.174 --> 47:29.171
<i>Eternally, He has conquered death</i>

47:29.180 --> 47:33.925
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

47:33.934 --> 47:37.143
<i>In honour and in glory</i>

47:37.146 --> 47:43.063
<i>Eternally, He has conquered death</i>

47:43.069 --> 47:47.439
<i>The grave is empty, Jesus lives now</i>

47:47.448 --> 47:49.815
<i>- Hello! Come in.
- In honour and in glory...</i>

47:52.703 --> 47:54.660
Hi.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.714
Well, here you go.

48:06.717 --> 48:09.175
Sorry, you want something else?

48:09.178 --> 48:11.386
- No, it's OK.
- You sure?

48:11.389 --> 48:13.346
- Yeah.
- OK, cool.

48:27.405 --> 48:30.489
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.031
- You're drinking?
- Yeah.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.704
Where have you been?

48:41.710 --> 48:45.044
Haven't you seen my messages?

48:45.047 --> 48:49.712
Yeah, sorry. It's just been hectic.
It slipped my mind.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.851
Hey, sorry I had to leave.

48:59.854 --> 49:03.063
It was nice.
Tell your mum I appreciated it.

49:03.065 --> 49:05.022
I will.

49:09.738 --> 49:13.527
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

49:15.119 --> 49:16.701
Did you arrive with Kristoffer?

49:18.414 --> 49:21.077
Yeah, we came together.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.533
OK.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.162
Hey!

50:26.023 --> 50:29.016
Hey, I'm not having any.

50:29.026 --> 50:32.019
- Many of us don't smoke.
- She knows that.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.074
Sorry, count me out.

50:51.549 --> 50:53.506
Take a proper puff.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.309
Wow. Shit.

51:11.569 --> 51:14.937
- Can you feel anything?
- Maybe a bit.

51:14.947 --> 51:17.655
Yeah? Like, what?

51:20.286 --> 51:22.323
One more time.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.667
- Now I feel something.
- Yeah? Good.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.377
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

51:31.380 --> 51:33.121
You're hammered.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.084
Is this normal?

52:15.174 --> 52:16.881
Yeah.

54:39.401 --> 54:42.018
<i>Hey! Hello?</i>

54:43.822 --> 54:46.781
Hey! They're making fun of you.

54:47.618 --> 54:50.156
There's no weed in that cigarette,
just tobacco.

54:51.163 --> 54:53.746
You know? They're mean.

54:55.918 --> 54:59.878
- Yeah. They were kidding.
- It got out of hand.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.668
Do you think it's funny?

55:02.674 --> 55:05.087
No, it's not, but...

55:06.303 --> 55:07.669
Oh, shit.

55:11.433 --> 55:14.050
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry.

56:14.288 --> 56:19.875
The scan we just took rules out
the possibility of a tumour.

56:19.877 --> 56:25.544
What I'm going to do is refer you
to a specialist ward for epilepsy.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.461
- OK...
- To give you a diagnosis,

56:27.467 --> 56:32.087
they must measure your brain activity
during a seizure.

56:32.097 --> 56:36.888
- What do you mean?
- We just need to hospitalise you

56:36.894 --> 56:39.887
- to observe you for a few days.
- Right.

56:41.023 --> 56:44.107
Now, I've got your journal here.

56:44.109 --> 56:49.195
It says you had some sort of seizure
when you were six years old.

56:50.574 --> 56:54.864
It was diagnosed
as a nervous breakdown.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.953
Are you sure?

56:56.955 --> 57:01.825
It says you received neuroleptic
medication for about a year,

57:01.835 --> 57:05.203
for irregular sleep patterns.

57:05.213 --> 57:09.298
- I didn't know that.
- You were given Nozinan.

57:09.301 --> 57:13.966
Nozinan is a very powerful drug
to give a child.

57:15.974 --> 57:18.387
Right.

57:18.393 --> 57:23.309
Otherwise, there's very little information
here. Almost nothing.

57:23.315 --> 57:27.776
Well, Dad's a doctor,
so he's always taken care of that stuff.

57:27.778 --> 57:31.237
- Your father's a doctor?
- Yes, a general practitioner.

57:31.239 --> 57:33.196
Oh.

57:34.701 --> 57:38.115
Well, then, you should ask him about it.

57:38.121 --> 57:41.831
- He can probably explain.
- OK.

57:43.919 --> 57:46.002
Mummy?

58:10.404 --> 58:12.487
Yes.

58:18.662 --> 58:22.906
No, not now, Thelma.
Can't you see he's feeding?

58:22.916 --> 58:25.499
Hey!

58:25.502 --> 58:27.459
Go downstairs and draw, OK?

58:42.644 --> 58:45.057
There. Yes.

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.100
Mattias?

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:14.725
Mattias!

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.904
Where's Mattias?

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.867
Have you taken him?

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.613
You mustn't do that! Where is he?

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:29.991
- I don't know.
- Tell me where you've put him.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.877
Tell me where you've put him, Thelma!

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.667
You...

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:40.718
Thelma? Where have you put him?

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:57.902
Hush. Trond!

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:08.075
Trond! He's under here.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.198
Careful, careful! Yes.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.286
We'll try one more round.
Open your eyes.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.248
Breathe quickly. In and out.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.215
Good.

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.920
Could you close your eyes?

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:11.017
Open your eyes again.
Breathe more quickly.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:47.512
Breathe in. Feel your lungs expand.

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:50.723
Hold your breath. And breathe out.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.886
Good.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.104
We're ready to do this.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:03.069
In order to provoke a seizure,
we have to, as we discussed,

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:06.906
try to reach
some fairly unpleasant places.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.201
If it's too much, just let us know.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.205
OK.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.164
How do you feel about
the upcoming exams?

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.666
Are you nervous?

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.340
Yes, quite.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:37.771
It's OK to reply, but you can just
shake your head or nod.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:42.733
Think about my questions.
Just let your thoughts flow freely.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:54.991
You mentioned that you had
a nervous breakdown as a child.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.998
When you were six.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.871
Do you remember anything about that?

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:11.926
Do you remember anything
about your parents at the time?

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.469
It must have been hard for all of you.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:18.846
Yes. No, I don't remember much.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:20.618
You recently moved to the city.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.168
Have you made any friends?

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.082
And what about boys?

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.383
If this is painful, try not to block it out.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.184
Is there someone special?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:55.650
Maybe it's not a boy at all?
Close your eyes.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.758
Breathe faster now.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.671
Faster. Good.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:21.596
Breathe even faster.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.291
Hello?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.904
Hello?

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.201
And... now open your eyes.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:22.661
Look into the light.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:31.878
Breathe more rapidly now. Good.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:46.344
I can see you're having difficult thoughts.
Don't hold back. Dive in.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.608
Go deeper.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.538
Breathe faster.
Keep breathing. In and out.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.921
<i>Lord, save me from these thoughts.</i>

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.465
Please, I beg you. Take them away.
Take them away.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:20.423
<i>Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone
right now, so please leave a message.</i>

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.416
I'll fast-forward a bit.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:05.834
Look at this. Nothing's happening.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:09.134
If it had been epilepsy,
we'd have seen significant spikes.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.307
So it's not epilepsy?

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.682
No, it's not.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:24.027
But what is it?
What's happening to me?

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.147
Well, it seems consistent

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:30.822
with what we call
psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:33.115
OK?

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:36.832
These seizures may be
a symptom of something else.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:41.412
A physical reaction
to mental suppression.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:46.417
- I don't know what you mean.
- It might just be due to stress.

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:49.090
It could also be some sort of trauma.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.471
Many different things.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.597
But something caught my attention.

01:11:56.604 --> 01:11:58.891
I looked at genetic predisposition.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:03.438
Your grandmother has had a fairly
extensive history of mental disorders.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:09.315
- Are you telling me I'm mentally ill?
- No, it's...

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.908
- That I'm mad, like Grandma?
- No, no.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:17.373
Relax. I can't access her diagnosis.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.868
But she's been in hospital
for a long time.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:24.542
You probably know
more about it than I do.

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:28.418
No, I don't know much about it.
She died a long time ago.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:37.468
OK. That's strange.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.435
It says here that she...

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:44.809
She was a patient at Hellersmo in 2016.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:51.615
The point is that you'll be referred
to a psychiatrist for diagnosis.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.701
- No, that can't be right.
- It's true.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:13:00.078
It says she was still at Hellersmo
in the spring of 2016.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.619
That's the latest.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:07.964
The point is that you'll be referred
to a psychiatrist.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:11.506
You'll have to take a good look
at these issues together.

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:27.387
Hello?

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.082
Grandma?

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.710
It's Thelma.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.308
Trond's daughter.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.445
Hi, it's Thelma.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:25.871
She's been like this for years.
I don't think she even knows we're here.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:39.919
She wasn't always like that. She used
to be lucid, but had serious delusions.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:43.843
I still think the drugs she's on
are much too strong.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.932
What sort of delusions?

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:51.605
Well, she was devastated
when her husband disappeared like that.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.401
- How?
- They never found his body. Just the boat.

01:16:56.403 --> 01:17:00.943
She became obsessed
with the idea that it was her fault.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:04.443
Well, so she was very confused.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:09.869
So when she got cancer,
she was convinced she'd caused it herself.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:15.120
- What do you mean?
- She thought...

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.758
That she caused things to happen.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:26.052
I told your father that
the medication she's on is way too strong.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:28.846
He didn't seem worried.

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:57.542
<i>Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone
right now, so please leave a message.</i>

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:13.979
...quite evident. We have n-tuple algebra,
true for all values of n.

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:18.351
Then we have two-
and three-dimensional interpretations...

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:37.248
<i>Hi, Thelma. Can't get hold of Anja...</i>

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:40.838
<i>Have you heard from her?
Vilde, Anja's mum.</i>

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:56.093
Something's happened.
I've had these seizures.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:59.305
I don't get it. This girl...

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:03.309
<i>What? What's happened?</i>

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.729
A girl is missing.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:11.147
And I just know it's my fault.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:15.693
I can't stop thinking about it. I know it.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:19.238
That it's my fault.

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.156
Can I come home?

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:25.040
<i>Of course you can come home, dear.</i>

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.747
OK.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.813
I know you've spent a lot of money

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.311
so I wouldn't have to work while I study.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.358
I'm sorry it turned out like this.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:02.861
You can take the exam later.
Don't worry.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.789
So what's the matter?

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:12.704
I've had seizures, epileptic seizures.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.711
But it's something else.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.800
Psychogenic seizures?

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.920
Yes.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:23.924
A patient of mine was diagnosed
with it a few years ago.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.426
- OK?
- It turned out fine.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:31.560
Drink your tea. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:43.819
The doctors said it could be stress,
but I don't know. I don't get it.

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:53.582
Are you OK?

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.753
Yes.

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.716
I'm just a little tired.

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:07.551
Don't be afraid.

01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:11.350
We've given you something
to help you calm down.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:26.111
We know what's happening to you,
Thelma. We'll help you.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.970
I have to tell you something.

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:56.183
It will be very painful.

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.274
"Quack!"

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:08.449
Mum forgot the washcloth.
You have to be good and sit here.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:13.541
I'll be right back. Can you
look after this for me? Good boy!

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.709
Are you up already?
You can go back to sleep.

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:31.183
Trond! Trond?

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:35.639
Mattias!

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:38.436
Trond!

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:44.318
Where is he?

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:47.450
Have you done something to him?

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:49.068
Just say it.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.288
- Tell me if you have.
- I haven't.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.456
I can't find him, Trond!

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:04.550
Could you look downstairs?

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.883
He's not up here either.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.266
Why aren't you answering me?

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.560
No! No!

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.522
No!

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:51.149
There's something within you.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:54.869
If you truly desire something,
with body and mind,

01:28:54.871 --> 01:28:57.864
there's something within you
that can make it happen.

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:02.285
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:17.012
Are you awake?

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:20.852
Can you sit upright?

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.704
Open wide.

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:46.454
Lift your tongue.

01:29:47.632 --> 01:29:49.464
I'm sorry.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:53.253
I should never have let you leave.

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:54.754
I thought it was over.

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:59.350
It hadn't happened
since you found God as a child.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.020
I'm going to help you.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:16.405
Dear Lord, Heavenly Father,
have mercy on me.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.245
I have sinned in mind and deed.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.739
My heart lusts for evil.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:25.414
Purify my heart
and redeem me by the Holy Ghost.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.754
Purify my heart and redeem me
by the Holy Ghost.

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:32.751
Purify my heart
and redeem me by the Holy Ghost.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:36.801
Purify my heart and redeem me
by the Holy Ghost.

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:39.844
Dear Lord, Heavenly Father,
have mercy on me.

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.184
I have sinned in mind and deed.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:44.349
My heart lusts for evil.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.018
Purify my heart...

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.354
I feel angry.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.687
I'm angry with you, God.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.069
Why are you doing this to me?

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.992
What do you want?

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.493
And I feel angry with Dad as well.

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:11.376
I'm not worth it.
He has to stop. I can't take it any more.

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:29.478
Why can't I just be what I am?
Why isn't that possible?

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.851
What about that poor girl?

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:35.905
She disappeared.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.901
Were you angry with her as well?

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.701
No.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:50.002
I was in love with her.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.628
And she loved me as well, and I...

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:01.801
She didn't love you, Thelma.

01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:06.643
Think about it.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:08.979
Did she like you before you wanted her?

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:15.478
Do you think she had a choice?
With what's within you?

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.988
You were probably just lonely.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.869
You needed someone.

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:38.629
I didn't want her to disappear.

01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:41.299
No, but deep down, you did.

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:46.850
That's how it happens.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:19.546
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:32.646
This is no use.

01:33:37.654 --> 01:33:40.237
We have to stop fooling ourselves.

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:43.903
What if she does it again?

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.664
You'll never be able to forgive yourself.

01:33:57.257 --> 01:33:59.044
Hey...

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.836
You're such a good man.

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:05.804
You're so kind.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:09.471
But this is about something
much greater than us.

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:12.720
We're being tested.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.350
And you said so yourself.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.695
If this doesn't work,
then we have to take the consequences.

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:29.203
No matter how painful it is.

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:31.868
Or how much we love her.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:39.588
You've done everything you can.

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.849
And we'll all meet again.

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.925
- Hi, Trond.
- Hi.

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.851
- Isn't that Thelma?
- Yes.

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:23.191
- Has she come to visit you?
- No, Thelma has moved back home.

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:26.896
Well, that's good.

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:11.691
It's OK. I've got it.

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:40.302
I went to see Grandma
at the nursing home.

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:45.649
Is that what you're planning to do to me?

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.732
Is it?

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.552
Can you please let me go?

01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:30.519
Go to sleep.

01:45:05.257 --> 01:45:07.294
Trond?

01:45:11.388 --> 01:45:13.380
Trond?

01:45:20.397 --> 01:45:22.730
Trond!

01:45:27.112 --> 01:45:28.523
Trond?

01:45:57.977 --> 01:46:00.310
Where's Trond?

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:06.812
What's going on?

01:46:51.572 --> 01:46:54.906
Thelma, don't leave. Thelma!

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:10.130
Thelma!

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.009
Thelma! Thelma...

01:48:33.465 --> 01:48:34.626
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:46.847
- You look like a real babe today.
- Thank you.

01:48:48.313 --> 01:48:51.101
You too. My jacket suits you.
