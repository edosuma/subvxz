in this crime?

want is Camille Leon.

then she'll be
looking to sell them.

10:19.386 --> 10:23.388
But we're keeping
an eye on you.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.255
[Beeping]

10:24.257 --> 10:27.192
Ugh. Knee highs
with flip-flops.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.595
Ok! Even I know
that's wrong!

10:30.597 --> 10:31.363
Wade?

10:31.365 --> 10:33.365
Your ride's hovering outside.

10:33.367 --> 10:36.468
The one place Camille
can get top dollar

10:36.470 --> 10:38.303
for stolen designs:

10:38.305 --> 10:40.372
Home of the fashion
underground.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.707
We're going to Italy!
Booya!

10:42.709 --> 10:45.877
I thought smarty mart had
you on stockroom duty.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.811
Oh, man!

10:46.813 --> 10:48.213
Yeah, way to undo the booya.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.714
That's ok, Ron.
I'll sub.

10:49.716 --> 10:52.283
Oh. Um, thanks,
but, uh,

10:52.285 --> 10:54.486
hey, Camille played me, too.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.487
Would love to stay and lecture

10:55.489 --> 10:56.788
on the dangers of mission work,

10:56.790 --> 10:59.457
but Milan calls.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.228
I think that girl
just ditched me.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.698
[Animals chattering]

11:06.700 --> 11:07.666
[Slurp]

11:07.668 --> 11:11.236
Hey, Mr. B.
Just taking 5.

11:11.238 --> 11:15.640
Just when do you plan
on beginning the actual work?

11:15.642 --> 11:20.412
I spent the last two 60s organizing
this stuff into 3 piles:

11:20.414 --> 11:21.613
Miscellaneous stuff,

11:21.615 --> 11:25.350
and stuff I might want
to buy with my discount.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.554
Stoppable, get this
into your nacho cheese head.

11:29.556 --> 11:34.459
According to department,
not personal, preference.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.561
Aw, man, now you tell me!

11:36.563 --> 11:40.231
Should not have done that.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.867
[Yelling]

11:43.536 --> 11:45.770
[Yelling]

11:47.507 --> 11:51.276
I thought we were gonna
be trapped in the stockroom.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.444
Yeah, lucky us.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.679
That would be much
worse than being...

11:54.681 --> 11:57.449
Trapped in a crate!

12:07.660 --> 12:09.861
I can't let you watch,
Dr. fusion.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.396
World security is at hand.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.233
Just try and stop me, dinoman.
Heh heh heh!

12:15.235 --> 12:15.900
[Chuckling]

12:15.902 --> 12:16.835
Monique!

12:16.837 --> 12:17.702
So many levels of wrong.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.903
And aren't action figures

12:18.905 --> 12:21.506
their holograms
aren't complete yet.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.974
You won't tell anyone, right?

12:22.976 --> 12:26.010
And I'll keep dinoman
and purple pants

12:26.012 --> 12:30.548
your ride, student parking lot.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.885
There's no way out,
Mr., Barkin!

12:33.887 --> 12:35.386
Stop your squirming, Stoppable,

12:35.388 --> 12:36.488
and look for a light source.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.956
Well, it's sort of
hard to focus

12:37.958 --> 12:41.259
when there's a flashlight
wedged in your back.

12:41.261 --> 12:41.993
Eh... Ow!

12:41.995 --> 12:44.963
Give me that.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.364
Ohh. Thanks, Mr. B.
Much better.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.367
Mr. Barkin,
your stubblage...

12:49.369 --> 12:51.302
how long have we been in here?

12:51.304 --> 12:52.837
Oh, about 19 minutes.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.840
I, uh...
Have to shave often.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.309
15 times a day.
Now, would you cut the chatter?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.711
I have to formulate a plan!

12:59.713 --> 13:00.945
Already got one.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.114
Help! Somebody help!

13:03.116 --> 13:04.983
That's not a plan.

13:04.985 --> 13:05.917
Not the boss of me.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.585
He-he-help!

13:07.587 --> 13:11.389
No one can hear us, man.
It's just you and me.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.791
[Moo]

13:12.793 --> 13:15.527
What is all this stuff, anyway?

13:15.529 --> 13:16.995
Appears to be returns...

13:16.997 --> 13:18.930
merchandise
that has been returned.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.999
Where does it get returned to?

13:21.001 --> 13:24.736
To the returns warehouse
overseas!

13:24.738 --> 13:27.539
[Yelling]

13:27.541 --> 13:30.942
Global positioning places the
entrance to the fashion underground

13:30.944 --> 13:32.644
somewhere in that building.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.079
Kim: As lairs go,
it's, uh...

13:35.081 --> 13:36.848
Pretty.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.317
Twill: Interesting.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.318
Every time we follow a clue

13:40.320 --> 13:41.619
on the stolen fashion designs,

13:41.621 --> 13:43.087
it leads to you.

13:43.089 --> 13:46.958
We're the fashion
police, miss possible.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.494
You can't pull the Marino
wool over our eyes.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.663
Or you wouldn't see those women

13:51.665 --> 13:52.564
their outfits?

13:52.566 --> 13:53.731
[Gasp] Criminal.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.500
Where?
Where?

13:56.035 --> 13:59.037
I'm going in.
Cover me.

14:10.015 --> 14:10.982
Ooh!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.383
Aah!

14:12.385 --> 14:13.918
Unh!

14:13.920 --> 14:15.753
Gosh, thanks a mil.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.721
[Gasp]

14:16.723 --> 14:17.555
Monique?

14:17.557 --> 14:23.595
Don't even try to float the
danger boat with me, girl.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.500
You don't want me here
because you're jealous

14:29.502 --> 14:33.671
that I got to see the
designs and you didn't.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.074
Unh!

14:36.076 --> 14:39.978
Tell me we are not
in the sewer.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.981
[Beeping]

14:42.983 --> 14:46.084
That's it!
I am officially nah!

14:46.086 --> 14:46.985
Eye to eye, Kim.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.086
Are you even listening to me?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.754
Wade, besides
your little surprise,

14:49.756 --> 14:55.026
the fashionistas use the latest
in autosensory defenses.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.527
The fashionistas?

14:56.529 --> 14:58.897
You don't know
the fashionistas?

14:58.899 --> 14:59.964
Should I?

14:59.966 --> 15:01.132
Sending profiles.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.467
Espadrille, hoodie, and chino.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.935
They copy the brand-name
designer fashions

15:03.937 --> 15:05.536
and sell knockoffs
around the world.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.972
They run the fashion
underground!

15:07.974 --> 15:08.940
Oh. Heh!

15:08.942 --> 15:09.874
See... hmm.

15:09.876 --> 15:10.876
Missions may be your bag,

15:10.877 --> 15:12.877
but fashion...
your sister.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.612
The fashionistas
will make millions

15:14.614 --> 15:16.614
flooding the market
with their counterfeit fashions.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.984
All thanks to Camille
and her stolen designs.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.452
Well, um, Monique,

15:21.454 --> 15:26.925
but... How would you
get us into the underground?

15:29.662 --> 15:30.995
Camille imitated you.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.464
A hit-back is fair game.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.667
[Indistinct]

15:37.870 --> 15:40.038
I can't believe
we're headed overseas.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.873
We could end up
in a whole other country.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.675
Stoppable, quit your whining.

15:43.677 --> 15:48.980
Here. Use this trenching shovel
to start our herb garden,

15:48.982 --> 15:52.083
uh, don't we need,
like, herbs for that?

15:52.085 --> 15:56.688
We'll harvest the soil
from our socks.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.857
Uh... Mr. Barkin?
You feel ok?

15:59.859 --> 16:01.726
This crate's not
getting to you, is it?

16:01.728 --> 16:02.794
Of course not!

16:02.796 --> 16:04.495
But why do you keep
calling me that?

16:04.497 --> 16:05.730
Mr. Barkin?

16:05.732 --> 16:06.464
[Moo]

16:06.466 --> 16:09.067
He's Mr. Barkin!

16:09.069 --> 16:11.069
Moo?

16:12.638 --> 16:15.740
There. My blog on
updating the yoga pant...

16:15.742 --> 16:16.607
done and done.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.176
Whoa!
Look who's back.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.612
And sporting a new accessory.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.785
Is that, like,
our fall collection?

16:27.787 --> 16:29.988
First shipment hits tomorrow.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.090
So many pirates,
so little time.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.726
Camille: Yoo-hoo!
Fashion friends!

16:34.728 --> 16:37.662
Greets.
Just came for more green.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.963
I've already spent
yesterday's score.

16:38.965 --> 16:42.066
Oh, that whole
foreign exchange thingy?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.001
So confusing.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.602
As if I'm a mathemagician.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.237
But if you're Camille...

16:46.239 --> 16:48.906
Then who's she?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.075
Clearly a poser.

16:51.077 --> 16:55.179
I mean, who wouldn't
want to be me?

16:57.549 --> 17:02.820
Props on the look, yeah,
but I'm the real Camille.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.792
It took, like, a lifetime

17:07.794 --> 17:09.027
to perfect this.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.661
Nice try,
wannabe-me,

17:10.663 --> 17:11.963
but if anyone knows a knockoff,

17:11.965 --> 17:15.066
it's the fashionistas.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.101
Tuesday, 1400.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.770
I'm surrounded
behind enemy lines.

17:18.772 --> 17:21.706
Operation desert trial
is in danger.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.674
Codename Ron Stoppable

17:23.676 --> 17:24.942
has crossed over
to the other side.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.544
Hey, at least I'm not the one

17:26.546 --> 17:29.313
talking into a rubber chicken!

17:29.315 --> 17:30.214
This time.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.149
Rubber chicken?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.084
Rubber chicken? No!

17:33.086 --> 17:34.952
Not again!
Mayday! Mayday!

17:34.954 --> 17:35.853
[Moo]

17:35.855 --> 17:38.723
I know.
Not looking good.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.125
Uh, what now, Kim?

17:43.028 --> 17:44.028
Unh!

17:44.030 --> 17:45.029
Unh!

17:45.031 --> 17:49.667

As in possible?

17:50.969 --> 17:54.205
Oh! Very good, Camille.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.710
[Kim grunts]

18:00.879 --> 18:02.280
[Gasp]

18:05.919 --> 18:08.152
Yeah, my battle skills
aren't quite in vogue.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.821
Play your strengths, Monique.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.323
Uh, accessorize.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.693
On it.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.261
Unh!

18:17.263 --> 18:19.197
Aah!

18:19.199 --> 18:21.833
Aah!

18:24.203 --> 18:26.104
Nice moves, possible.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.706
I may design a tracksuit
after you.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.174
Unh!

18:30.309 --> 18:34.045
Design?
Don't you mean steal?

18:34.047 --> 18:36.681
Whatevs.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.693
Unh!

18:48.695 --> 18:50.261
[Gasp]

18:50.929 --> 18:53.131
[Gasp]

18:53.133 --> 18:54.799
Aah!

18:56.034 --> 18:59.303
Oh, please.
These will never sell.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.038

19:08.247 --> 19:10.114
[Grunt]

19:12.951 --> 19:15.353
New knot. You like?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.422
Ohh. Yes.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.761
[Grunting]

19:23.763 --> 19:27.965
Cute look, but it needs a belt.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.837
I disagree.
The belt? Too much.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.075
[Gasp]

19:38.944 --> 19:39.911
So, uh, Kim, yeah,

19:39.913 --> 19:41.078
that whole danger excuse?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.947
Turns out you knew your stuff.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.883
I was jealous that
you got to see the designs.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.684
Forgive?

19:46.686 --> 19:49.120
Forgive. But, um...

19:49.122 --> 19:51.856
Can we pick this up later?

19:54.994 --> 19:58.095
Sorry to crash
the big kiss and cry,

19:58.097 --> 20:01.933
and we're putting you
out of it.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.904
Monique, the designs!

20:10.475 --> 20:12.810

Code red.
I repeat, code red.

20:58.224 --> 20:59.824
Send immediate reinforcements.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.026
Oh. Oh, sure.
Now you arrive.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.129
We're trained for couture,
not combat.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.831
What's happening, Monique?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.033
I'll tell you what's happening.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.434
Camille attacked me.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.204
They both showed up
in the same outfit.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.805
How humiliating.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.473
Two Kims.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.408
Which one is real?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.409
Hmm.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.112
You know, I may not
know where we are

21:21.114 --> 21:22.046
or what's going on,

21:22.048 --> 21:23.914
but I know my own girlfriend.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.816
No, Ron, you don't.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.086
Patent shoes, 100% silk blouse

21:29.088 --> 21:30.054
arrest her!

21:30.056 --> 21:31.155
Why? I think
it works.

21:31.157 --> 21:35.192
This is Camille Leon,
your thief.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.361
There's your collar.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.463
[Grunting]

21:39.465 --> 21:44.001
Look, prison is so, like, lame.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.503
Oh, can't I do house arrest

21:45.505 --> 21:48.339
at one of those
yummy villas in Tuscany?

21:48.341 --> 21:50.808
Good eye... Monique.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.045
The crate trappage may
have affected my judgment.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.379
I was sitting with a cow!

21:55.381 --> 21:57.581
He was talking to a
chicken, and the...

21:57.583 --> 22:00.184
mm-hmm.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.587
The designs,
Mr. banana, sir.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.457
We recovered them in Milan.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.426
Feh. I scrapped
these two days ago.

22:08.428 --> 22:12.029
I'm taking the fall line
in a new direction.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.131
Can you believe we
went all that way...

22:14.133 --> 22:16.100
And took on
the whole underground,

22:16.102 --> 22:17.468
just for him to...

22:17.470 --> 22:18.969
Tears.
Tears.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.072
[Crying]

22:23.109 --> 22:28.612
Uh... Not sure
this is accurate.

22:28.614 --> 22:29.580
I'm in French heels.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.982
Which is count one.
Those pumps?

22:31.984 --> 22:32.917
Closed toes!

22:32.919 --> 22:34.585
Spring calls for strappy.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.553
Turn to the left.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.121
Count two: The boa robe.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.090
Clearly, you didn't
pull it off.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.057
Turn to the right.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.058
Count 3: The stole.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.927
Chicken was so two seasons ago.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.462
Count 4:
The lampshade fedora.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.031
Your parents must be
real proud of you.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.134
You realize that I don't
normally dress in this manner.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.902
Tell it to the judge, pal.
