00:51.595 --> 00:53.594
England, in the year 1215,

00:53.678 --> 00:57.469
had been under the reign
of King John for 16 years.

00:59.219 --> 01:01.552
The most villainous
of England's monarchs,

01:01.678 --> 01:05.093
John was renowned
for losing wars with France,

01:05.220 --> 01:07.928
levying punitive taxes,

01:08.054 --> 01:10.677
and sleeping with the wives of barons.

01:12.428 --> 01:15.844
The barons finally rebelled
against their king,

01:15.970 --> 01:19.219
and became locked
in a bloody civil war

01:19.346 --> 01:23.594
lasting for over 3 years
and decimating both armies.

01:24.429 --> 01:28.844
In time, the Knights Templar
were drawn into this conflict.

01:28.970 --> 01:32.303
With the help of
these highly trained warrior monks,

01:32.429 --> 01:36.761
King John and his royal army
were eventually defeated.

01:38.304 --> 01:41.762
It was agreed that John
could remain on the throne,

01:41.887 --> 01:44.303
on one condition

01:44.429 --> 01:46.595
that he would sign a document

01:46.721 --> 01:50.845
upholding the rights and privileges
of all free men,

01:50.970 --> 01:54.887
but ultimately limiting
the power of the monarchy.

01:56.137 --> 01:57.887
Make it count.

01:59.013 --> 02:02.303
The Magna Carta
was sealed at Runnymede

02:02.429 --> 02:07.511
on the 15th of June
in the year of our Lord 1215.

02:07.638 --> 02:10.803
It will be remembered
throughout history.

02:10.930 --> 02:15.386
What is not remembered
is what King John did next.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.179
Sire?

02:47.138 --> 02:49.220
Sire?

02:49.347 --> 02:51.763
It's time.

03:47.805 --> 03:49.721
Hyah!

03:49.847 --> 03:51.430
Hyah! Hyah!

03:58.264 --> 04:00.763
England welcomes you.

04:00.889 --> 04:02.430
Does the Pope hold his word?

04:02.556 --> 04:08.388
Oh, now have faith,
Captain Tiberius.

04:08.514 --> 04:12.180
His Eminence
is waiting to hear you hold to yours.

04:12.306 --> 04:16.221
The Church will stay out of your lands,
you have his word.

04:16.348 --> 04:18.055
We'll get your country back.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.639
What say you?

04:52.723 --> 04:57.139
Abbot Marcus.
We seek shelter from the storm.

05:00.598 --> 05:03.097
Open the gates!

05:14.973 --> 05:16.556
Come and help.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.556
What business do you have here?

05:34.390 --> 05:37.848
Our business is with God at Canterbury.
We need only shelter.

05:37.974 --> 05:40.389
Shelter you shall have. Food also.

05:40.515 --> 05:42.306
You treat the Lord's servants well.

05:42.432 --> 05:45.890
You wear the mark of the Templars,
yet you carry no swords.

05:46.016 --> 05:47.723
These men have no more need to fight.

05:47.849 --> 05:51.765
Templars masking their faith
and travelling without swords.

05:51.891 --> 05:53.057
How noble!

05:53.183 --> 05:56.349
As God is our witness, Baron,
these men have nothing to hide.

05:56.474 --> 06:00.223
Abbot, save your benedictions.
The Templars fought against the King.

06:00.350 --> 06:04.474
Now you sleep in a king's castle.
These men have plenty to hide.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.349
You there. What say you?

06:06.475 --> 06:09.349
They say nothing.
They hold vows of silence.

06:10.224 --> 06:14.349
Templars without tongues.
Very well.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.765
Just be gone by the morning.

06:25.391 --> 06:26.682
Back inside!

06:35.808 --> 06:37.349
Marshal.

06:37.475 --> 06:42.223
When I accept guardianship over men
who take the vows of silence,

06:42.350 --> 06:45.557
I'm also informed of what led them to me
in the first place.

06:45.683 --> 06:48.682
I know the Templars
placed a heavy burden on you.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.474
I know you're deeply scarred.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.016
The cross on your tunic

06:54.142 --> 06:57.058
is a symbol
of your faith in God's will.

06:57.184 --> 07:01.349
It should not be full of the torment
it now bears upon your soul.

07:02.391 --> 07:04.557
When we arrive at Canterbury,

07:05.642 --> 07:09.016
I'm requesting your leave from
the Order of the Knights Templar.

07:57.267 --> 08:00.892
Garrison men!

08:02.768 --> 08:04.100
King John!

08:07.225 --> 08:09.934
Men, to the gates!
It's the King!

08:10.060 --> 08:12.142
Open the gates for the King!

08:14.768 --> 08:16.309
Psst!

08:22.517 --> 08:25.475
Marshal, did you see royal colours?

08:55.393 --> 08:57.809
Is that your hand, Darnay?

08:57.935 --> 08:59.184
Forced, Your Highness.

08:59.310 --> 09:04.559
The barons threatened my life,
forcing me to sign it and betray you.

09:04.685 --> 09:07.517
I know the feeling.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.392
Hang him!

09:11.810 --> 09:13.392
This insanity must cease.

09:14.185 --> 09:17.184
Open the door.
His quarrel is not with us.

09:17.310 --> 09:20.559
If you three stand before the King,
there will be nothing but death.

09:38.019 --> 09:42.226
What good fortune, Darnay.
It seems you will have your last rites.

09:42.353 --> 09:43.726
My Lord, Templars.

09:43.852 --> 09:47.310
He's travelling en route
to Canterbury with Templars.

09:50.311 --> 09:54.226
To what do I owe the pleasure
of the Church visiting my castle?

09:54.353 --> 09:58.518
We were in the storm, sire.
Baron Darnay granted us your hospitality.

09:58.645 --> 10:00.435
- We?
- My fellow priests.

10:00.561 --> 10:02.893
Ah, yes, I heard.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.226
Templars.

10:04.353 --> 10:08.393
Sire, we entered your castle
as unarmed men. We seek no fight.

10:08.519 --> 10:11.268
Are you aware, Abbot,

10:11.394 --> 10:14.685
that your kind stood at Runnymede
and forced my signature,

10:14.811 --> 10:16.602
and now you sleep under my roof?

10:16.728 --> 10:18.936
Your Highness,
we travel to Canterbury

10:19.061 --> 10:21.435
with simple articles of faith.

10:22.519 --> 10:24.894
I ask your mercy that we may pass.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.644
And I will grant you the same mercy

10:27.770 --> 10:31.102
that the Church and the barons
of this country bestowed unto me.

10:31.227 --> 10:34.894
"Do unto others",
isn't that right, Abbot?

11:13.937 --> 11:15.852
Tiberius!

12:06.063 --> 12:07.270
Don't let him go!

12:22.563 --> 12:23.811
Ride!

13:31.689 --> 13:33.772
There is worth...

13:35.564 --> 13:37.688
..in every death.

13:39.648 --> 13:43.396
And I will see it now in yours.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.147
- You saw the King?
- Yes. And he saw me.

14:26.273 --> 14:27.397
Mm.

14:29.023 --> 14:32.980
I didn't imagine that even he
was capable of such cruelty.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.147
Abbot Marcus was the finest of men.

14:36.814 --> 14:41.022
Tell me, why did he request
that you leave the Order?

14:41.148 --> 14:45.022
- Your Grace, I did not wish to be dismissed.
- But that's not what I asked.

14:46.315 --> 14:47.731
You were in the Holy Lands?

14:48.856 --> 14:52.564
Hm. Some men have returned
from defending our faith

14:52.690 --> 14:55.064
only to find themselves questioning it.

14:55.940 --> 14:58.731
Now you must ask yourself,
Thomas...

14:58.857 --> 15:00.898
what is in your heart?

15:01.565 --> 15:03.522
Rebellion or revenge.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.981
I suppose it makes no difference
as the King has the devil in his.

15:09.107 --> 15:12.898
I don't care if he's talking
to the Pope! I have to see him now!

15:13.024 --> 15:14.648
And as we speak of the devil...

15:17.649 --> 15:19.190
My Lord Archbishop.

15:20.398 --> 15:22.065
They told me about Darnay.

15:22.191 --> 15:24.231
We took John at his word...

15:24.357 --> 15:26.940
and now he raises a bitch's army
with God's teeth.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.357
I'll bow to no king with piss for blood!

15:29.482 --> 15:31.898
Baron William de Albany,
Brother Thomas Marshal.

15:32.024 --> 15:34.689
Brother Thomas
comes directly from Darnay Castle.

15:34.815 --> 15:39.023
You must forgive our Baron,
his tongue is not always so profane.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.606
Now, you should know
that Rome sides with the King.

15:45.690 --> 15:50.065
And the Pope would bless
what the King did to Abbot Marcus?

15:50.191 --> 15:51.231
More or less.

15:53.524 --> 15:57.273
I am to be excommunicated
for writing Magna Carta.

15:57.399 --> 15:59.815
- How long have we got?
- God knows.

15:59.941 --> 16:02.774
Your Grace, this...

16:04.107 --> 16:06.607
..king... must be stopped.

16:06.733 --> 16:12.065
I cannot, in all honesty,
ask you to fight, Thomas,

16:12.191 --> 16:17.024
but if you choose to take up
your sword, you have my blessing.

16:55.484 --> 16:57.566
It's a good omen.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.274
God is with us.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.107
Prince Louis has an army
may be persuaded to join us.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.441
Asking the French for help

17:07.567 --> 17:10.398
that's cursing the blind for the wicked.

17:11.858 --> 17:15.023
If John takes the Dover Road to London

17:15.150 --> 17:19.273
he has to cross the Medway here
at Rochester.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.691
I'll seize Rochester Castle.

17:22.692 --> 17:26.025
Delay them. That'll give you time
to negotiate with the French.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.983
We have no force to fight the King.

17:30.525 --> 17:32.108
I have a few men I can count on.

17:32.233 --> 17:36.232
Absolutely not. Suicide is a sin
in the eyes of the Church, Baron.

17:36.359 --> 17:40.691
Your Grace,
I'm afraid I only see one thing.

17:40.817 --> 17:45.733
From Rochester, the King
is able to dispatch his troops and supplies

17:45.859 --> 17:47.900
all over the country.

17:48.484 --> 17:53.816
It is his keystone.
Without it we will not stop him.

18:00.692 --> 18:02.733
All my sins to this.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.192
May God protect what we are about to do.

18:42.069 --> 18:43.442
Guy!

18:44.526 --> 18:46.651
Squire!

18:51.234 --> 18:53.400
I want you to ride back.

18:53.526 --> 18:55.359
No. I know how to fight.

18:55.485 --> 18:57.859
You see how he talks to me?

18:59.735 --> 19:02.817
Have you ever killed a man, squire?
Eh?

19:04.777 --> 19:09.443
- Then you will learn, it is not a noble thing.
- Not even when it's for freedom?

19:10.526 --> 19:12.276
Not even when it is for God.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.443
Hah!

19:49.611 --> 19:51.401
Look at you!

20:01.235 --> 20:06.360
Any one of you throws
a turd or a bean, I'll get you!

20:06.486 --> 20:07.944
And you know I will! Yargh!

20:08.070 --> 20:10.652
- Where's the butchers?
- Over there.

20:10.778 --> 20:13.152
I'll remember your faces!

20:15.569 --> 20:19.860
Sheep shears!
They're sharp! Sharp sheep shears!

20:19.986 --> 20:22.652
- I'm looking for Daniel Marks.
- Wait here.

20:24.653 --> 20:25.735
Marks!

20:30.153 --> 20:32.652
Whatever it is or how much...

20:34.111 --> 20:38.319
- just get me out of here, Baron.
- Done. Where's de Lacy?

20:38.445 --> 20:40.777
- He went back to Poitou.
- Becket?

20:40.903 --> 20:43.027
You don't want him.

20:45.820 --> 20:48.653
Templars.
They've come back.

20:55.070 --> 20:58.069
Here. You may need protection.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.361
Get up.

21:16.403 --> 21:18.945
I said, get up!

21:19.071 --> 21:21.195
You sack of shit!

21:23.237 --> 21:24.486
Billy.

21:25.779 --> 21:27.527
What told me I'd see you?

21:28.570 --> 21:31.736
What's with the altar boy?
Billy all tied up with God again?

21:36.196 --> 21:37.903
- This is not our man.
- Hoy!

21:39.196 --> 21:41.986
I'm his man,
don't you worry about that.

21:43.154 --> 21:46.694
If he pays me enough,
I'll split the gut of any man alive.

21:46.820 --> 21:48.570
Ain't that right, Billy boy?

22:02.071 --> 22:05.278
- Who's with you?
- Gil Becket. Daniel Marks.

22:05.404 --> 22:08.779
The last time we were all together
must have been Dieppe.

22:08.905 --> 22:10.820
The days
when the King was still good to us.

22:10.947 --> 22:13.111
He's taken all the castles
along the coast.

22:13.237 --> 22:16.320
If he takes Rochester,
he'll control southern England.

22:16.446 --> 22:20.362
If the whispers I've heard are true,
he's too strong now.

22:21.196 --> 22:24.029
He's got an army of Danish mercenaries.

22:24.155 --> 22:25.946
Wait for him in London.

22:26.072 --> 22:30.779
Do you think I want this?
I'm not a soldier, not any more.

22:30.905 --> 22:34.695
I'm a fat wool merchant with
a hen-pecking wife and three daughters.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.570
But, unfortunately,
he won't let it be.

22:42.238 --> 22:44.321
I'm sorry, Baron. Not this one.

23:08.739 --> 23:10.613
I learnt about the Crusades.

23:12.822 --> 23:14.488
Is it true what the Templar swords say?

23:14.614 --> 23:17.905
"Blessed and omnipotent
is the warrior of Christ"?

23:37.697 --> 23:39.072
Yeah, water. Water.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.571
- Hey!
- Agh!

23:44.697 --> 23:46.780
What do you think he's worth?

23:48.906 --> 23:51.155
- Are you sorry for what you've done?
- Bollocks.

23:54.656 --> 23:58.364
- Release him.
- Amen!

24:12.490 --> 24:14.364
Papa!

24:20.114 --> 24:22.364
Get inside. Now!

24:34.365 --> 24:36.948
- Joseph.
- Baron.

24:37.073 --> 24:38.447
- Daniel.
- Wulfstan.

24:43.074 --> 24:44.864
Becket.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.531
You... are a filthy whore, Becket.

25:16.657 --> 25:18.156
So was she.

25:18.282 --> 25:20.573
We'll never hold that castle
with this lot.

25:21.616 --> 25:26.198
They may not be worthy of that cross
you wear, but they'll hold the castle.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.906
Not for England...
not for God...

25:30.032 --> 25:31.448
but for me.

25:33.282 --> 25:37.031
Winter's soon,
so if I'm not back by first snowfall,

25:37.157 --> 25:42.114
take your sister to your aunt,
give her this. Hm?

25:42.240 --> 25:44.114
Work hard.

25:46.199 --> 25:47.865
Be polite.

27:02.659 --> 27:04.658
And what's written here is true?

27:06.700 --> 27:09.158
From my ears to this paper, Sire.

27:10.617 --> 27:13.449
Tiberius, 6 of your fastest scouts
to Rochester.

27:13.575 --> 27:15.783
Instruct them to hold the castle.

27:16.742 --> 27:19.824
- Kill anyone they find there.
- Hyah!

27:19.951 --> 27:21.407
Money.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.824
And you know these men?

27:27.076 --> 27:29.116
So what does that make you?

27:29.242 --> 27:30.824
Worthless.

27:41.992 --> 27:43.659
There it is.

27:46.159 --> 27:47.533
Looks small from here.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.700
That... small castle...

27:50.825 --> 27:54.116
controls all the land
as far as you can see.

27:54.242 --> 27:55.659
Be patient, Squire.

27:55.785 --> 27:57.700
As long as there's women.

28:34.202 --> 28:37.909
- What say you?
- I bring business from Archbishop Langton.

28:47.868 --> 28:49.409
Isabel!

28:50.160 --> 28:51.659
We have company.

28:51.785 --> 28:55.284
I have told you before,
I will not tolerate drinking.

28:57.661 --> 28:59.159
You won't tolerate anything.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.201
My Lord. We have men at the gate.

29:11.535 --> 29:14.743
I tolerate the politics of the King, Isabel.

29:14.869 --> 29:17.368
Our marriage
was arranged for land and wealth.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.159
It would be well
if you were to remember that.

29:24.661 --> 29:27.534
And he owns us, body and soul.

29:27.661 --> 29:30.160
Open the gates! Let 'em in!

29:54.495 --> 29:58.785
You arrive unexpected,
Baron de Albany.

29:58.911 --> 30:01.160
What matter
does His Grace send this late?

30:01.286 --> 30:03.743
That we claim this castle
in the name of the rebellion.

30:03.869 --> 30:06.452
If your visit is to claim my castle, Baron...

30:07.203 --> 30:08.661
you're too late.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.077
Unusual saddles.

30:15.203 --> 30:17.661
- Danish.
- What was that?

30:17.787 --> 30:20.702
They're Danish.
They arrived last night.

30:23.703 --> 30:27.702
The King's scouts.
His army is less than a day away.

30:31.286 --> 30:33.369
Oaks, get the guard here quickly.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.494
That one was at Darnay Castle
2 days ago.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.827
Aargh!

31:42.579 --> 31:43.912
Argh!

31:51.621 --> 31:53.370
No. No, no!

31:58.579 --> 32:00.079
Marshal, down!

32:26.746 --> 32:27.828
Yargh!

32:37.163 --> 32:39.204
Baron.

32:39.330 --> 32:42.454
Stand down! Stand down!

32:42.580 --> 32:44.287
Listen to me.

32:45.372 --> 32:49.204
By the archbishop, we claim this castle
in the name of the rebellion.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.663
The rebellion's over.
The King surrendered to the great charter.

32:54.246 --> 32:55.913
Magna Carta.

32:56.039 --> 32:58.788
This one sealed by the King's own hand.

32:58.914 --> 33:02.913
And now...
he's executing everybody who supported it.

33:03.039 --> 33:09.371
But does the Pope know that the Archbishop
is claiming royal castles, against the King?

33:09.497 --> 33:12.329
I watched as three
of my brothers were killed

33:12.455 --> 33:16.704
by the soft hand of a king that is
murdering his way across the country.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.454
And he does so
with the Pope's blessing.

33:21.538 --> 33:24.372
The French army make sail any day now.

33:25.789 --> 33:28.829
Giving us... a new king.

33:30.247 --> 33:32.330
A true king.

33:34.872 --> 33:36.996
Seal the gates.

33:37.122 --> 33:42.622
Lock all the doors! Move!
And, Oaks, no one else comes in.

33:42.747 --> 33:44.205
Very well.

33:45.456 --> 33:46.955
Well, Marshal...

33:47.997 --> 33:51.163
you got us our castle.

33:53.914 --> 33:57.538
- What is your strength, Captain?
- 11 men-at-arms.

33:58.915 --> 34:01.288
- We have less than 20 men?
- And these walls.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.246
- They've never been breached.
- Does the keep have a portcullis?

34:04.373 --> 34:06.413
- It does.
- Good.

34:09.873 --> 34:14.205
- Once it's down, no one gets in.
- Water. Where is the supply?

34:14.331 --> 34:18.705
From the well. Draws straight from the river.
No one here gets thirsty.

34:19.998 --> 34:23.830
- It's good, it's not sick or brackish?
- Water's good, sir.

34:25.748 --> 34:27.830
Guy, with me.

34:29.373 --> 34:33.331
These walls are designed
to be defended by one man per station.

34:33.456 --> 34:36.456
Outlook is perfect.
Any approach can be seen for miles.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.871
Now, let's see the gatehouse.

34:44.873 --> 34:49.871
You, day or night, stay alert.
Now open it up.

35:06.165 --> 35:07.831
What's the problem?

35:08.957 --> 35:11.414
There's no moat.

35:29.832 --> 35:31.831
That'll do.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.082
Now, when they come...

35:36.208 --> 35:37.498
..hit them hard.

35:38.582 --> 35:40.082
Hit the post.

35:44.416 --> 35:47.665
I said, hit the post. Hard.

35:51.749 --> 35:54.831
They'll come? The French.

35:54.958 --> 35:58.957
We waited for the French at Damascus.
They didn't come then.

35:59.083 --> 36:02.706
Even to a Frenchman I think
Rochester is nearer than Damascus.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.040
Hit it.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.831
You better hit it harder than that, boy.

36:13.333 --> 36:17.040
Or you'll be dead
before they get here.

36:32.667 --> 36:34.874
They hate women.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.999
Just to look at one's a sin.

36:37.125 --> 36:39.124
Some people say they worship the devil.

36:39.249 --> 36:43.666
Celibates with stone hearts.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.332
Then I have a stone heart, too, Maddy.

36:47.917 --> 36:49.999
I didn't mean it like that.

36:51.583 --> 36:54.999
A Templar offers his chastity to God,

36:55.125 --> 36:56.791
but a wife...

36:56.917 --> 36:59.624
she suffers hers by her husband.

37:01.625 --> 37:04.874
My husband's appetites don't include me.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.541
Thank the Lord Mary herself.

37:22.417 --> 37:26.041
Now, I am...
..curious, Albany.

37:26.167 --> 37:30.999
Why is it that you and your friends
are so struck with this rebellion?

37:31.125 --> 37:34.041
- Mm.
- Cos we are for the people.

37:35.668 --> 37:38.708
I see your esquire is well-trained
in the art of naivety.

37:38.834 --> 37:41.625
- Go on.
- Call me naive if you will, sir,

37:41.751 --> 37:44.792
but the people deserve more than
a king that treats them like animals.

37:44.918 --> 37:47.166
Ah, bold words for a squire.

37:48.376 --> 37:50.208
Have you read Magna Carta?

37:50.334 --> 37:53.917
- I...
- Ah, I see. You can't read Latin.

37:54.043 --> 37:57.416
It's a pity, arguing from ignorance.

37:58.751 --> 38:04.042
Argumentum ad ignorantiam,
ab uno disce omnes.

38:06.085 --> 38:08.167
That's Roman, innit?

38:10.918 --> 38:12.750
From one person, learn all people.

38:16.168 --> 38:19.000
Excuse my wife's bold tongue.

38:34.876 --> 38:38.042
Becket,
I'm gonna need you on the far wall.

38:38.168 --> 38:40.876
- Guy can't defend it on his own.
- Do it yourself.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.125
What?

38:45.251 --> 38:47.501
You want a drink? A woman?

38:53.377 --> 38:56.250
Don't you sniff your nose at me.

38:56.377 --> 39:00.250
I've been places.
I've seen what your holy brothers have done.

39:01.044 --> 39:02.918
Your pious bile makes me sick.

39:04.002 --> 39:07.126
Becket. I want you outside.

39:09.585 --> 39:12.960
I'll watch your boy's back,
but who's watching mine?

40:14.586 --> 40:16.502
To the battlements!

40:16.628 --> 40:19.585
- To the battlements!
- Right away!

40:19.711 --> 40:24.086
- Take your positions, men!
- Get those men up here, quickly!

40:25.878 --> 40:27.585
Mercel, they're here!

40:41.337 --> 40:43.586
Let's see what rats
have taken up in my home.

40:43.711 --> 40:45.877
Move it!
Come on!

40:46.003 --> 40:50.044
Albany, a word. You cannot engage the King
without considering terms.

40:50.170 --> 40:53.169
He wants our heads on spikes.
Where are the terms in that?

40:53.295 --> 40:56.378
There are some in here
who didn't pick this fight.

40:56.504 --> 40:58.835
Ask yourself who you're for, Cornhill.

40:58.962 --> 41:02.628
The King or the country?
Because we both can't be wrong.

41:06.337 --> 41:08.294
They're here.

41:13.629 --> 41:15.086
Albany!

41:19.212 --> 41:20.378
Albany!

41:20.504 --> 41:24.962
How did he know?
What can we do for you, John?

41:28.379 --> 41:30.670
Baron William de Albany.

41:30.796 --> 41:34.962
The Pope has ordered me
to reclaim my country.

41:36.420 --> 41:41.379
Now, surely you don't bar your door
against a king, and the Church?

41:42.254 --> 41:44.337
Does he know you sealed a charter...

41:44.462 --> 41:46.878
giving the people of England freedom,

41:47.004 --> 41:49.003
and that now you go back on your word?

41:49.129 --> 41:51.711
England is mine, Albany.

41:52.921 --> 41:57.170
God's will bestowed it unto me,
the Pope blesses it to me,

41:57.296 --> 42:00.379
and this castle belongs to me!

42:00.505 --> 42:02.170
You're no more a king...

42:02.296 --> 42:04.379
than the boil on my arse!

42:05.796 --> 42:07.212
Huh.

42:08.588 --> 42:10.587
What a tedious little man.

42:13.171 --> 42:15.170
Get the swords now. Come on!

42:16.880 --> 42:18.712
Move yourselves!

42:21.922 --> 42:23.462
Stay by your posts.

42:23.588 --> 42:27.337
Remember,
they have to climb over these walls.

42:27.463 --> 42:29.337
And we do not.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.629
So you stand firm!

42:36.630 --> 42:38.879
Have you ever fought so many with so few?

42:39.630 --> 42:43.171
Uh-huh.
Don't you forget, you hold the wall, huh?

42:43.296 --> 42:45.921
Now, go to your post.

43:04.255 --> 43:07.546
North and south advance!

43:10.047 --> 43:12.463
Get ready, archers!

43:15.464 --> 43:17.505
Loose!

43:19.255 --> 43:21.546
Take cover!

43:29.714 --> 43:31.213
And again! Take cover!

43:32.339 --> 43:33.964
Get down!

43:34.089 --> 43:35.505
Ha-ha!

43:37.756 --> 43:42.380
Come on, lads, come on!
Take your positions! Look lively!

43:46.006 --> 43:49.047
Take cover, lads! Take cover!

43:51.131 --> 43:52.463
Argh!

43:55.589 --> 43:57.255
Again!

44:07.090 --> 44:08.422
Argh!

44:23.465 --> 44:25.464
Albany!

44:25.590 --> 44:27.797
Archers! They're coming!

44:29.548 --> 44:31.381
Make a stand! Ready?

44:31.507 --> 44:32.798
Load arrows!

44:34.048 --> 44:35.880
Loose!

44:59.465 --> 45:03.048
- Oil! Bring up that oil!
- Ready!

45:03.174 --> 45:05.673
Loose!

45:10.299 --> 45:11.839
Oil! Watch your back!

45:49.174 --> 45:50.507
Take cover!

46:36.092 --> 46:37.424
Becket!

46:38.967 --> 46:41.424
Come on. This way.

46:48.050 --> 46:50.508
- What do we do?
- Pray God is with them.

46:52.883 --> 46:54.549
Becket!

46:58.759 --> 47:00.299
Ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!

47:25.842 --> 47:27.883
Guy!

47:29.009 --> 47:30.549
Show that to your mother!

47:42.717 --> 47:44.384
Now, get up!

47:44.509 --> 47:46.300
I said get up!

47:46.426 --> 47:48.467
Now, you hit him. Hard!

48:01.842 --> 48:04.092
Behind you! Clear!

48:04.218 --> 48:05.841
Take cover!

48:23.426 --> 48:24.550
Aargh!

49:16.344 --> 49:17.677
They're running!

49:17.803 --> 49:20.760
They're retreating!
They've had enough, Baron.

49:43.928 --> 49:46.593
Bastards! Go on, run!

49:53.678 --> 49:57.677
Come on, you foreign whores!

50:36.762 --> 50:38.427
You fought bravely.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.386
You did not see everything.

50:48.720 --> 50:51.928
There's no finding peace after knowing this.

50:54.887 --> 50:56.886
Faith, Guy.

50:59.595 --> 51:03.552
Only the weak believe
that what they do in battle...

51:03.679 --> 51:05.928
is who they are as men.

51:21.887 --> 51:23.970
Put him with the others.

51:25.554 --> 51:28.595
Pack 'em over there.
Over there, that's it.

51:30.887 --> 51:32.345
Baron Albany...

51:32.471 --> 51:34.261
in less than a day...

51:34.388 --> 51:38.345
you have stripped away
everything I gave the people in this castle.

51:38.471 --> 51:43.553
- Get off my back.
- You were hellbent on this fight!

51:43.680 --> 51:49.011
You made us all hostages
to your cause, not the rebellion's.

51:49.137 --> 51:52.345
And this was not just another castle!

51:53.179 --> 51:54.887
This was my home!

51:56.096 --> 51:58.762
Now clear your mess up.

52:11.638 --> 52:13.595
Shut the door.

52:35.846 --> 52:37.887
Still now.

52:40.514 --> 52:41.679
Wait. Here.

52:41.805 --> 52:44.596
- This man is bleeding.
- On the table.

52:55.013 --> 52:58.137
No. Wait.
This will stop the flow.

52:59.430 --> 53:01.805
I'm gonna pull this hard.

53:05.681 --> 53:07.888
The bone's not broken, but...

53:09.263 --> 53:12.972
Go on, do it, do it.

53:24.139 --> 53:27.471
Keep it clean, and watch him close.

53:28.973 --> 53:30.263
Templar.

53:31.348 --> 53:34.596
- Your neck.
- No.

53:34.722 --> 53:36.888
Sit.

53:38.306 --> 53:39.638
Please.

54:18.181 --> 54:22.389
If the bleeding doesn't stop,
shall I fasten a belt around your neck?

54:27.598 --> 54:30.722
My maid tells me you cannot look at women.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.639
What is your name?

54:42.349 --> 54:46.223
Am I to assume your silence means
you cannot talk to women either?

54:47.431 --> 54:49.847
My name is Thomas Marshal.

54:52.974 --> 54:55.056
There it is.

55:05.474 --> 55:08.682
And were many sacred vows
broken by that revelation?

55:43.599 --> 55:47.015
It's not like the others.
The river naturally defends.

55:47.141 --> 55:50.807
Walls built...
so a few can stop many.

55:50.933 --> 55:53.015
Don't insult me, Captain.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.682
I know the qualities of a Norman keep.

55:57.808 --> 56:00.015
What I am having trouble with...

56:00.141 --> 56:05.932
is how a thousand men could have failed
so miserably against 20.

56:06.058 --> 56:09.057
Those men fight hard. For what?

56:09.183 --> 56:11.140
A small rock in a field?

56:11.266 --> 56:12.682
We go around.

56:14.724 --> 56:19.265
My great, great grandfather
built that rock

56:19.392 --> 56:21.848
when he conquered this country.

56:21.975 --> 56:28.265
Strategically, it fortifies London
and controls all of southern England.

56:28.392 --> 56:32.391
Why in God's name do you think they
chose to hole up there in the first place?

56:35.892 --> 56:39.474
What will please
your people more, Captain?

56:39.600 --> 56:41.933
That your men died in a great battle,

56:42.725 --> 56:47.599
or that your reward for helping me
is the Church leaving your lands alone?

56:47.725 --> 56:51.808
For that is what
the Pope promised he would do.

56:51.934 --> 56:55.891
Now, however small it may seem...

56:56.767 --> 57:01.183
..with that rock,
the rest of this country follows.

57:04.767 --> 57:07.058
Now you see what he means to do.

57:08.142 --> 57:10.100
I say this to each of you.

57:11.184 --> 57:13.516
There's a night out there...

57:13.642 --> 57:17.183
deep enough for a man to slip away,
if he should wish.

57:17.309 --> 57:19.599
And I would understand.

57:27.559 --> 57:29.724
I think you upset him.

57:31.476 --> 57:34.225
What about you, Marks?

57:34.351 --> 57:37.266
I took this for you at Angouleme.

57:37.393 --> 57:40.058
I walked into this outside Toulouse.

57:40.184 --> 57:44.308
Both times we saw it through.
What do you think I'm doing here?

57:47.059 --> 57:49.558
I don't take a man's money and run.

57:53.476 --> 57:56.558
Mr. Phipps, are you and your
garrison men still for the fight?

57:56.685 --> 57:59.892
All 6 of us. Good and ready, sir.

58:03.351 --> 58:04.767
Ah!

58:22.394 --> 58:24.642
I saw you with the Templar.

58:27.060 --> 58:29.767
I think he has a mind for you.

58:32.102 --> 58:34.559
His mind possesses nothing
I care to think about.

58:36.602 --> 58:40.476
There is something not normal with him.
It's his manner.

58:41.310 --> 58:43.643
He looks but won't talk.

58:43.768 --> 58:47.559
Then he talks
and nothing he says settles with me.

58:47.686 --> 58:51.934
Don't tell me that was his way before he
became a Templar. I wouldn't believe it.

58:52.060 --> 58:54.184
- My Lady.
- What?

58:55.185 --> 58:57.476
That's a great deal of thinking...

58:57.602 --> 59:00.518
for someone
you don't want to think about.

59:03.435 --> 59:04.893
Hm.

59:12.103 --> 59:13.935
They're building something.

59:15.352 --> 59:16.935
What do you think it is?

59:21.602 --> 59:23.935
Your royal engineer, Sire.

59:24.061 --> 59:29.060
- Will it work?
- There's no moat, er... So, er...

59:30.602 --> 59:34.185
There's no moat and no excuses. Finish it.

59:38.560 --> 59:41.185
Tell him to construct a...

59:58.770 --> 01:00:01.143
I am sorry for what I said to you.

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:03.727
I was wrong.

01:00:09.269 --> 01:00:12.018
What happens next... to us?

01:00:12.144 --> 01:00:14.268
- All of us?
- They will attack again.

01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:17.894
And we will hold again.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.477
The French...

01:00:22.979 --> 01:00:25.978
..made sail
with an army to stand by us.

01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.811
You really believe they will come?

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:32.228
Hm.

01:00:34.436 --> 01:00:36.103
Thou shall not lie, Thomas.

01:00:36.229 --> 01:00:38.435
Certainly not for the French.

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:42.144
Definitely not to me.
It isn't worth it.

01:00:56.895 --> 01:00:59.311
Does that break Templar laws?

01:01:00.104 --> 01:01:01.228
Mm.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.311
Some would say yes.

01:01:07.479 --> 01:01:09.728
Put the sword down.

01:01:14.187 --> 01:01:17.269
If they do come,
I will need to know how to use this.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:24.812
- Is this how you hold it?
- If you want your opponent to win.

01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:35.603
I fight...

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.311
..so you don't have to.

01:02:00.438 --> 01:02:02.312
Siege tower.

01:02:02.438 --> 01:02:05.020
Making quick work of it.
Damn it.

01:02:05.146 --> 01:02:07.645
Baron, I have an idea.

01:02:21.813 --> 01:02:24.604
What happens if this doesn't work?

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:27.187
- Don't ask.
- What could be worse than this?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:31.979
Squire, would you ever kill a woman?

01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:36.312
- Never.
- Not even if it meant saving her life?

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:39.980
That's it, heave it down.

01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:49.187
Holy Saint Joseph! Look who it is.

01:02:49.313 --> 01:02:52.021
His Majesty is ready, my Lord.

01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:02.063
- Prince Louis holds in France.
- They haven't sailed yet?

01:03:02.189 --> 01:03:06.021
- He's buying time to negotiate terms.
- Negotiate terms!

01:03:07.106 --> 01:03:08.896
The King enslaves this country,

01:03:09.022 --> 01:03:11.813
the Pope defends him
and calls the Magna Carta heresy,

01:03:11.939 --> 01:03:15.604
and France uses this tyranny
for a better deal?

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:18.438
- Are there any men willing to fight?
- A few.

01:03:18.564 --> 01:03:22.480
Many thought the rebellion was over
because John signed the Magna Carta.

01:03:22.606 --> 01:03:25.605
In some ways,
it was the smartest thing he did.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.771
Well, all that is done.

01:03:27.897 --> 01:03:30.397
Let Rome pronounce
whatever holy dictum it pleases.

01:03:30.523 --> 01:03:33.854
They won't tell me
that God is their possession.

01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:37.271
I leave for France at once.
You gather what men you can.

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:40.313
And prepare London for war.

01:03:40.439 --> 01:03:42.313
And Rochester?

01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:47.105
- Baron Albany?
- Pray God is with them.

01:03:50.564 --> 01:03:52.230
Take cover!

01:04:04.272 --> 01:04:06.147
Excellent. Excellent.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.772
Go on. Faster!

01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:18.647
Lock it!

01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:33.523
- Lock!
- And fire!

01:04:39.898 --> 01:04:41.147
They have built an engine?

01:04:43.732 --> 01:04:44.773
Yargh!

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:01.064
Take cover!

01:05:05.816 --> 01:05:07.815
All of you, outside.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.940
Wulfstan, you've broken through!

01:05:15.066 --> 01:05:17.856
Now, come on! Give them hellfire!

01:05:17.983 --> 01:05:21.273
Heave!
Heave!

01:05:24.066 --> 01:05:25.815
Aargh!

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:31.940
Lock it!
Fire pot, Guy!

01:05:34.483 --> 01:05:36.148
You heathen dogs!

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.565
Bring it a bit forward!

01:05:58.733 --> 01:06:01.023
Light it!
Light it!

01:06:02.274 --> 01:06:04.232
Loose!

01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:09.232
Yeah!

01:06:09.358 --> 01:06:13.107
Goddamn devils!
Murdering goddamn whores!

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:21.565
Yes! They burn!

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.232
Do not record that!

01:06:25.358 --> 01:06:27.399
Bitches!

01:07:05.484 --> 01:07:07.692
This bastard king, Wulfstan.

01:07:07.817 --> 01:07:09.692
Aye.

01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:19.650
After that,
the king did not come again.

01:07:20.818 --> 01:07:23.525
But the rains did.

01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:28.566
And the days grew short
as autumn turned to winter.

01:07:29.985 --> 01:07:33.233
They were too cold to fight,
and too hungry.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:37.650
The castle stores were empty...

01:07:37.776 --> 01:07:40.150
and they had taken to eating the horses.

01:07:41.401 --> 01:07:43.942
Save for one.

01:07:44.068 --> 01:07:45.733
Marshal's.

01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:50.150
But a Templar
is forbidden to eat his horse.

01:07:50.276 --> 01:07:54.650
Their Order dictates
that it must die in battle.

01:07:54.776 --> 01:07:59.317
So 13 hungry souls
and one horse would remain.

01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:04.359
Still they waited.

01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:06.775
And so too did the King.

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:13.984
They could smell his food,
hear his army's song.

01:08:15.068 --> 01:08:20.274
For attrition is one man's ally
and another man's curse.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.651
So they became cursed men.

01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:26.818
And as weeks turned to months,

01:08:26.943 --> 01:08:29.943
their minds took
to places they should not...

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:37.317
where a man sees only doubt
and has no worth at all.

01:08:59.361 --> 01:09:02.776
On my wedding day
I knew my marriage would have no love.

01:09:04.694 --> 01:09:06.693
Yet still I took my vows to God.

01:09:09.152 --> 01:09:13.567
I honoured and obeyed
my commitments daily.

01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:21.193
You think we are not the same, Thomas,
but you're wrong.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.484
- I'm starving!
- What do you want me to do?

01:09:46.528 --> 01:09:48.944
Someone's gotta do something!

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:51.193
Listen to me.

01:09:52.653 --> 01:09:55.111
Damn your Templar vows!

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.735
It was my vows
that made me what I am.

01:10:03.987 --> 01:10:06.360
It was my Order that brought me here.

01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:10.069
And by God's good grace,

01:10:10.195 --> 01:10:13.860
it will be the Templars
that save your life.

01:10:19.112 --> 01:10:20.735
Where are you going?

01:10:22.153 --> 01:10:23.986
Why are you leaving?

01:10:44.487 --> 01:10:46.569
Why would he leave?

01:10:50.654 --> 01:10:53.695
My Lady, you were with him last.

01:10:54.612 --> 01:10:56.695
Did he say why he left?

01:10:59.112 --> 01:11:00.903
You go to your chamber.

01:11:01.946 --> 01:11:03.611
Now.

01:11:04.737 --> 01:11:06.403
No.

01:11:32.446 --> 01:11:35.529
I'll kiss the Bishop's arse
if he comes back.

01:11:41.571 --> 01:11:47.195
You're gonna have to kiss a king's arse,
Becket, cos they're coming back again.

01:11:49.113 --> 01:11:51.861
- It's Thomas!
- Open the gates!

01:11:53.655 --> 01:11:56.779
Becket, get him!
Get him, Becket!

01:11:56.904 --> 01:12:01.362
Come on! Quickly! Help him!
Get the sacks. The sacks!

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:03.862
- Come on!
- Hurry!

01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:07.320
- Run!
- Close the portcullis!

01:12:13.905 --> 01:12:16.320
What was you thinking, Templar?

01:12:16.446 --> 01:12:20.071
He's stolen the king's food.
I've never seen such a thing!

01:12:35.613 --> 01:12:38.612
You are relieved of your command, Captain.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.696
Get back in your rowboat and go home.

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.862
- I'm not leaving without my men!
- Oh yes, you are!

01:12:50.989 --> 01:12:54.488
And I will tell you why.
The Pope has had a change of heart.

01:12:54.614 --> 01:12:56.029
What do you say?

01:12:56.155 --> 01:12:59.655
I say that when your pathetic little army
arrives back at your houses,

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.279
you will find your lands Christianised.

01:13:02.406 --> 01:13:06.822
Your sons enslaved to the Church
and your wives serving new husbands.

01:13:06.947 --> 01:13:09.446
You did not speak to the Pope
of my lands?

01:13:09.572 --> 01:13:13.738
Why in God's name
would I do that?

01:13:13.864 --> 01:13:15.488
Take this castle, Tiberius!

01:13:15.614 --> 01:13:20.863
And if you do not, you will be sailing
home to quite a different world.

01:13:33.656 --> 01:13:38.655
Well, Marshal, you sure know
how to pick a bit of shank.

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:42.114
Better than
3 months of horse meat.

01:13:43.198 --> 01:13:45.530
I'll stick with the pig.
Then what?

01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:47.530
I'll eat you.

01:14:01.906 --> 01:14:04.780
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.322
So, squire...

01:14:15.782 --> 01:14:17.781
you can read words?

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:22.030
And write them too?

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.197
What's your full name?

01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:33.031
Jedediah Coteral.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:51.990
Jedediah Coteral.

01:14:53.699 --> 01:14:54.948
Yeah.

01:14:56.824 --> 01:15:00.240
I've never seen it written before. Huh.

01:15:04.532 --> 01:15:05.698
Hm.

01:17:45.451 --> 01:17:48.742
It's too quiet.
Check the far wall.

01:18:28.535 --> 01:18:30.867
To the battlements! Attack!

01:18:30.994 --> 01:18:33.951
Cover the west wing.
West wing! Come on!

01:18:37.119 --> 01:18:38.867
- Watch out!
- To the right!

01:18:43.702 --> 01:18:45.867
Help me!

01:18:49.827 --> 01:18:52.076
The gates! The gates!

01:19:28.661 --> 01:19:30.326
Where's Marshal?

01:19:30.452 --> 01:19:32.243
Fight, Guy! Fight!

01:19:58.661 --> 01:20:00.327
Baron!

01:20:00.453 --> 01:20:01.660
Aargh!

01:20:03.995 --> 01:20:06.369
Baron!

01:20:26.662 --> 01:20:27.995
Don't move. Be still.

01:20:29.453 --> 01:20:31.661
- Hold the keep.
- You can't die.

01:20:31.787 --> 01:20:36.703
You can't die. Stay alive!
You hear me?

01:20:36.829 --> 01:20:39.536
Hold the keep! Go! Go!

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.412
Yaargh!

01:21:28.121 --> 01:21:29.495
Phipps!

01:21:33.538 --> 01:21:36.328
- Come here!
- Hold the gates!

01:21:38.746 --> 01:21:40.578
I've got it. I've got it.

01:21:40.705 --> 01:21:42.996
Come on, to the gates!

01:21:43.121 --> 01:21:44.370
Hold!

01:21:44.496 --> 01:21:46.079
All in! All in!

01:21:53.122 --> 01:21:55.037
Stand fast!

01:21:56.247 --> 01:21:57.704
Shield wall!

01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:00.870
Shields. Shields up!

01:22:00.997 --> 01:22:02.370
Up!

01:22:02.496 --> 01:22:04.370
Brace yourselves.

01:22:04.496 --> 01:22:06.829
Ready! Ready!

01:22:58.914 --> 01:23:00.871
- Isabel!
- Get inside!

01:23:00.998 --> 01:23:03.038
Now!

01:23:57.289 --> 01:23:59.664
- We have to get to the Baron!
- To the keep!

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:03.288
- We can't leave him!
- He's gone, all right?

01:24:15.707 --> 01:24:17.998
Hold the steps! Hold the steps!

01:24:18.124 --> 01:24:19.580
Come on!

01:24:23.207 --> 01:24:25.123
Marshal!

01:24:40.707 --> 01:24:42.331
Pull him down!

01:24:47.748 --> 01:24:49.540
Marshal!
Come on!

01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:10.039
Get it off! Get it off!

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:16.748
Get back, behind the portcullis!

01:25:19.457 --> 01:25:21.665
Come on!

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:49.290
They have prisoners.

01:25:57.250 --> 01:25:58.873
Boy!

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:15.082
Good afternoon, Baron.
Did you find my castle to your liking?

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:17.082
It's the people's castle now.

01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:21.332
You said he was gone.

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:25.791
Those two.
Cut off their hands and feet.

01:26:27.083 --> 01:26:29.374
- No.
- No!

01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:32.791
No!

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.125
No!

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:40.374
Now, Baron,
I want my keep back.

01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:46.083
- At my command!
- No!

01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:48.791
- They'll never surrender.
- Really?

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:52.333
Do it!

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:57.541
Do something!
We hold the keep.

01:27:09.543 --> 01:27:14.500
My arse, your stinking castle!

01:27:23.543 --> 01:27:24.916
Aaargh!

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:33.750
Aargh!

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.042
God damn you, you murdering whore!

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:41.083
Isn't that the king I am?

01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:44.959
You betray all that's meant to be king.

01:27:45.085 --> 01:27:48.001
You betray God!

01:27:48.127 --> 01:27:50.417
I betray God?!

01:27:52.918 --> 01:27:57.209
My crown was passed to me by my brother,
and my father before him.

01:27:57.334 --> 01:28:00.500
I was born to be a king!

01:28:00.626 --> 01:28:04.667
It is my birthright!
Given to me by God!

01:28:04.793 --> 01:28:07.583
You cry for the common man

01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:11.834
and in the same breath
you curse the crown that protects him!

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.376
You dare to question my reign...

01:28:15.502 --> 01:28:18.292
and the lineage of Kings
who have reigned before me?!

01:28:18.419 --> 01:28:22.750
The great amaranthine royalty
of Aquitaine...

01:28:24.210 --> 01:28:27.834
..who forged this land from barbarian hordes

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.084
and made it noble and pure!

01:28:31.210 --> 01:28:33.793
Who gave it order, meaning,

01:28:33.918 --> 01:28:35.501
and even faith...

01:28:35.627 --> 01:28:39.334
to thousands of years of loyal subjects!

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.084
And it is all now questioned by you!

01:28:42.210 --> 01:28:45.918
And we are forced
to sign your precious Magna Carta,

01:28:46.043 --> 01:28:49.793
forced by you, a wool merchant!

01:28:49.919 --> 01:28:55.418
I am the blood!
I am God's right hand!

01:28:55.544 --> 01:29:01.543
And you will never
dictate to me how I am to be a king!

01:29:05.419 --> 01:29:07.292
Now, Baron.

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:11.710
Which hand did you touch me with?

01:29:13.502 --> 01:29:15.584
Hold his hand down.

01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:19.002
Hold his right hand down!

01:29:21.585 --> 01:29:24.419
This is not something you should see.

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:44.918
Aargh!

01:29:49.003 --> 01:29:52.127
Tell your rebels to open the gate, Albany!

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:54.585
No surrender!

01:29:56.503 --> 01:30:00.836
- No surrender!
- Put his other hand up! Do it!

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.085
Do it!

01:30:04.211 --> 01:30:05.460
Aargh!

01:30:07.878 --> 01:30:09.752
We hold, Baron!

01:30:09.878 --> 01:30:11.961
We hold!

01:30:13.336 --> 01:30:16.211
Put his feet up. Put his feet up!

01:30:18.962 --> 01:30:20.128
Cornhill!

01:30:20.254 --> 01:30:22.961
You will yield to your king!

01:30:23.087 --> 01:30:27.253
Or, as God hears me,
your head is on a spike!

01:30:36.837 --> 01:30:41.128
Now, that monster that they've made,
strap his carcass to it.

01:30:41.254 --> 01:30:42.545
Strap him to it!

01:30:53.671 --> 01:30:55.253
Heave!

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:09.461
There's no one coming, is there?

01:31:48.463 --> 01:31:50.628
My scouts report
the French have left Calais.

01:31:50.754 --> 01:31:54.254
They'll be at our back within days.

01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:57.295
Do you know that when I was a child,

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:04.421
I once secretly ate every urn
of my father's beloved honey peaches.

01:32:04.547 --> 01:32:06.337
And the next day...

01:32:06.463 --> 01:32:10.962
he brought before me a servant girl
that he had accused of the crime.

01:32:12.088 --> 01:32:15.921
And he placed her hand on the table,
and he drew his knife...

01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:21.004
..and he delivered the punishment.

01:32:22.088 --> 01:32:24.462
And that night,
unable to contain my shame,

01:32:24.588 --> 01:32:28.088
I confessed to him that it was I,

01:32:28.213 --> 01:32:31.295
his son,
who had committed the crime.

01:32:31.422 --> 01:32:33.088
Do you know what his response was?

01:32:33.213 --> 01:32:36.213
He said, "I know.

01:32:36.338 --> 01:32:38.462
"I know.

01:32:38.588 --> 01:32:42.005
"And that is why I only cut off her finger.

01:32:42.131 --> 01:32:45.462
"You see, John,
any action against the throne

01:32:45.588 --> 01:32:47.546
"must be punished ruthlessly.

01:32:50.006 --> 01:32:55.213
"For that is the only way
to maintain the absolute power...

01:32:56.797 --> 01:32:58.463
"..of a king."

01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:21.381
When they come,
you must demand to see the King.

01:34:21.507 --> 01:34:23.589
I want nothing from him.

01:34:24.716 --> 01:34:26.381
Not even mercy.

01:34:35.632 --> 01:34:37.840
I broke my vow, Isabel.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:40.923
I have betrayed God's trust.

01:34:42.799 --> 01:34:44.589
What we did was a sin.

01:34:44.716 --> 01:34:47.589
Stop hiding...
behind vows and commandments.

01:34:49.257 --> 01:34:53.923
The vows speak of loyalty
and abstinence and murder, but...

01:34:55.215 --> 01:34:57.589
why never love, Thomas?

01:34:57.716 --> 01:34:59.798
The vows of the Order...

01:35:01.507 --> 01:35:05.631
..protect my soul from the blood
I've spilt in God's name.

01:35:05.757 --> 01:35:08.631
It was the Church
that made you do those things.

01:35:08.757 --> 01:35:11.382
It was the Templars that gave you a sword

01:35:11.507 --> 01:35:13.257
and the name of God to wield it.

01:35:13.383 --> 01:35:16.007
It was the Templars that made you kill.

01:35:18.258 --> 01:35:19.923
Who were you before them?

01:35:21.091 --> 01:35:25.840
What was so bad about that man then
that makes you resist your desires now?

01:35:27.383 --> 01:35:28.798
Thomas...

01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:35.340
I am not a sin.

01:35:39.425 --> 01:35:42.173
Sire? Sire?

01:35:45.216 --> 01:35:48.340
Your engineer, sire.
The mine is ready.

01:35:48.466 --> 01:35:50.257
Will it work?

01:35:51.174 --> 01:35:54.882
- It's right under the keep's foundations.
- Ah.

01:35:57.383 --> 01:35:59.882
Then take note.

01:36:00.009 --> 01:36:05.049
To my justiciar, send to me 40 pigs.

01:36:06.466 --> 01:36:08.549
The least good for eating.

01:36:11.383 --> 01:36:13.465
Deliver that at once.

01:36:13.591 --> 01:36:18.966
Come on! Hurry up! Move it!

01:36:25.426 --> 01:36:27.049
That's it.

01:36:27.175 --> 01:36:31.174
- Where you going?
- I'm going to plead for terms.

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:32.425
No!

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:35.508
What else is there to do?
We hold.

01:36:35.633 --> 01:36:39.674
We hold for what? The French?
They're not coming.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.341
- I'll ask for terms.
- No!

01:36:44.509 --> 01:36:48.717
We swore an oath. An oath!

01:36:48.842 --> 01:36:51.466
To Albany. To England.

01:36:51.592 --> 01:36:54.049
Your oath is worthless.

01:36:56.134 --> 01:36:58.883
Magna Carta is worthless.

01:36:59.009 --> 01:37:00.924
The Church has annulled it.

01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:04.883
Whatever happens here is meaningless.

01:37:05.009 --> 01:37:07.925
No. No. Wait!

01:37:09.551 --> 01:37:12.758
- That's enough, squire.
- Becket?

01:37:12.884 --> 01:37:16.134
Your boy here
tried to take the old man's head off.

01:37:16.259 --> 01:37:18.633
Becket, leave him be.

01:37:24.135 --> 01:37:27.466
Now, Guy... get away from him.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.300
- Now.
- Or what?

01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:33.675
You'll kill me?

01:37:35.135 --> 01:37:36.967
- Guy...
- Shut up!

01:37:37.968 --> 01:37:41.717
Baron de Albany
gave his life for his beliefs.

01:37:43.843 --> 01:37:46.342
What have you given for yours?

01:37:46.468 --> 01:37:47.800
Coward.

01:38:02.301 --> 01:38:04.634
There's no salvation to this end.

01:38:05.884 --> 01:38:07.676
Our souls...

01:38:08.926 --> 01:38:10.634
are damned.

01:38:18.218 --> 01:38:19.551
You are not a coward.

01:38:56.969 --> 01:39:00.301
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing my name.

01:39:01.469 --> 01:39:03.343
How do you do that?

01:39:03.469 --> 01:39:06.093
Master Guy taught me.

01:39:06.219 --> 01:39:08.884
Well, that's you all done then.

01:39:09.011 --> 01:39:11.135
What makes a man like you so angry?

01:39:11.261 --> 01:39:13.260
I've been angry so long...

01:39:13.386 --> 01:39:16.051
I don't even remember.

01:39:18.177 --> 01:39:21.552
It's kept you alive though, I suppose.

01:39:23.344 --> 01:39:27.427
I don't think
it's gonna get us through this one.

01:39:47.594 --> 01:39:52.510
- What do you think they're doing?
- Pigs. For a sapper's fire.

01:39:54.386 --> 01:39:57.427
- Sappers?
- They're digging a mine underneath us.

01:39:57.553 --> 01:40:00.428
Pig's fat, it burns,
with the heat of a crucible.

01:40:01.553 --> 01:40:03.219
Make way!

01:40:04.594 --> 01:40:06.885
Go on! Go!

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.969
Whoa!

01:40:12.095 --> 01:40:13.344
Whoa there!

01:40:14.387 --> 01:40:15.594
Whoa!

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.094
Bring them in.

01:40:49.971 --> 01:40:52.137
We've got a bigger problem.

01:40:53.595 --> 01:40:55.845
Hah! Get in there!

01:40:55.971 --> 01:40:57.845
Go on!

01:41:41.722 --> 01:41:43.804
Coteral.

01:41:46.513 --> 01:41:48.595
It's hot.

01:41:48.722 --> 01:41:52.220
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Templar.

01:41:52.346 --> 01:41:54.429
We get to the other side of the keep.

01:42:06.722 --> 01:42:09.637
Guy, take the women to the chapel, huh?

01:42:09.763 --> 01:42:10.971
Go!

01:42:11.097 --> 01:42:14.345
Hurry, Isabel.

01:42:32.722 --> 01:42:35.013
Get down! Get down!

01:43:28.431 --> 01:43:31.680
- I think he's gone.
- I'm not making that mistake again.

01:43:31.806 --> 01:43:33.555
Come on.

01:43:38.265 --> 01:43:41.014
OK.
One, two.

01:43:53.848 --> 01:43:56.639
Oh, Maddy. She was beside me.

01:44:06.849 --> 01:44:08.848
Becket. Becket.

01:44:13.265 --> 01:44:15.514
Ha!

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.222
I'll hold them off.

01:44:17.348 --> 01:44:20.056
How much did they pay
to get you out those stocks?

01:44:20.181 --> 01:44:23.723
- 5 shillings.
- That is cheaper than a whore.

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:34.556
Come on, you filthy whores!

01:44:48.349 --> 01:44:51.681
If they get through us,
you kill the women.

01:44:51.807 --> 01:44:53.723
- No.
- Say it.

01:44:53.849 --> 01:44:55.889
- I can't.
- Say it!

01:44:57.349 --> 01:44:58.598
I'll kill the women.

01:45:04.099 --> 01:45:09.515
Come on, you whore! Yaargh!

01:45:20.307 --> 01:45:22.056
Aargh!

01:45:55.183 --> 01:45:56.598
Aargh!

01:46:49.183 --> 01:46:51.391
Forgive me.

01:46:56.226 --> 01:46:58.349
Thomas. Thomas!

01:47:04.143 --> 01:47:05.392
Thomas!

01:47:23.393 --> 01:47:25.808
Save her.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.642
No one touch him!

01:47:35.768 --> 01:47:37.517
How's your faith now, Templar?

01:47:37.643 --> 01:47:39.726
Why don't you come a little closer...

01:47:42.309 --> 01:47:44.308
..and I'll show you.

01:48:46.728 --> 01:48:48.059
Yaaargh!

01:51:33.521 --> 01:51:35.478
You fought bravely.

01:51:37.730 --> 01:51:39.437
Is killing a noble thing?

01:51:42.771 --> 01:51:48.062
But a life fought for others
is a life worth living.

01:51:49.147 --> 01:51:51.687
That is a noble thing.

01:52:18.063 --> 01:52:21.521
A French prince
now holds the English crown.

01:52:24.896 --> 01:52:26.521
Not an easy decision to make.

01:52:27.689 --> 01:52:29.146
Nor was this one.

01:52:30.230 --> 01:52:32.104
The Order's over for you, Thomas.

01:52:33.856 --> 01:52:36.396
You've earned your freedom
as much as any man.

01:52:36.522 --> 01:52:38.146
Your Grace.

01:52:40.023 --> 01:52:41.646
Come on.

01:52:51.689 --> 01:52:53.646
We held.

01:53:11.481 --> 01:53:14.604
Within a year,
the rebellion was won.

01:53:14.731 --> 01:53:20.397
While fleeing for his life,
King John died of dysentery.

01:53:20.523 --> 01:53:23.980
What was left of his treasure
was never recovered.

01:53:26.023 --> 01:53:29.689
In time, the great keep of Rochester
was rebuilt.

01:53:29.814 --> 01:53:31.439
It stands to this day.

01:53:32.314 --> 01:53:37.147
So too does the noble dream that was...
Magna Carta.
