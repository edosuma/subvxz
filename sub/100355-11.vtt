WEBVTT

00:09.487 --> 00:12.882
- Hey--
- I have mace, jackass.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.666
Oh, it's you.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.582
- Listen, uh, sorry I didn't
make your thing last week.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.149
I was stuck in hell.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.586
- Don't sweat it.
I didn't miss you.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.935
- Right.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.720
Your mom said
I could have the weekend.

00:24.763 --> 00:27.418
Maybe we could bond,
uh, do stuff.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.900
Come on.
I'm trying.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.947
- All right.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.602
What is our father-daughter
weekend gonna look like?

00:37.646 --> 00:39.126
- I got tickets
to the roller derby.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.519
There should be lots
of blood and cleavage.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.131
- I just remembered I actually
have a big history test

00:44.174 --> 00:45.262
on Monday, so I can't.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.351
I got to study.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.353
- Study.
Hmm.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.355
Very important.
Study.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.097
Yes, right.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.540
- What's that?
- That's a time machine.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.802
- Is it?

01:06.283 --> 01:09.721
Can I see it?
- I thought you had to study.

01:09.765 --> 01:13.682
- Oh, well, it could be useful
for a history test.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.423
- Mm.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.218
Basically, this bucket of bolts
can travel anywhere in history.

01:28.262 --> 01:32.570
We can catch a show
with The Ramones, see Sabbath.

01:32.614 --> 01:36.748
- Lita Ford of the Runaways?
- That too.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.664
- Oh, I've been fighting
so hard to get you out of hell,

01:39.708 --> 01:41.144
and you are finally here.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.580
- I bet you're
the only one on this ship

01:42.624 --> 01:43.668
who's happy to see me.

01:43.712 --> 01:44.930
- Oh, nonsense.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.367
As far as this sad lot
is concerned,

01:46.410 --> 01:47.933
as soon as anyone
stops trying to murder them

01:47.977 --> 01:49.848
on a weekly basis,
they're best friends.

01:49.892 --> 01:52.851
- Either way, I am gone the
second Charlie uses that loom

01:52.895 --> 01:54.157
to bring my mom back.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.116
- Yeah.

01:56.159 --> 01:59.510
- What is she doing?

01:59.554 --> 02:01.382
- She said she wanted to get
into the right headspace, so...

02:01.425 --> 02:03.166
- Oh.
- I totally get that.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.994
There's nothing like a
20-second meditation micro-sesh

02:05.037 --> 02:06.082
to Zen out--

02:06.126 --> 02:07.257
- Did we miss the weaving?

02:07.301 --> 02:08.345
I hope we didn't
miss the weaving.

02:09.477 --> 02:10.739
- Whoa.
- What?

02:10.782 --> 02:12.219
- Gary, what--
You have a dog?

02:12.262 --> 02:13.568
We don't have dogs.
This is not a dog place.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.918
- I have a letter
from my therapist.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.267
- We don't have
therapists either.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.487
- Well, we should.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.880
Going to hell generated
a lot of anxiety.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.233
- Well, this says this is
his emotional-support animal.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.409
It's signed and everything.
- I don't have time for this.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.062
- I've named him Gary Junior.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.978
- Oh, he's made a tiny tinkle.
- Ew.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.980
- He isn't ship-broken.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.507
Junior!
He's usually a very good boy.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.639
Everyone, watch your step.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.642
- Oh. Chasing tail now,
are we, Gary?

02:44.686 --> 02:46.035
That's a first.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.428
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't step--

02:47.471 --> 02:48.646
- Dog--
- Bollocks.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.909
Gary!

02:50.953 --> 02:53.216
- Whew.
All right, almost ready.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.131
I think.
It's been a few millennia.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.655
Okay, so who's gonna get
the first weave?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.788
- Her mother.
- My mother.

02:59.831 --> 03:03.661
- Behrad first, John.
- Yeah, look, uh...

03:03.705 --> 03:08.492
well, I made a promise
to Astra, love.

03:08.536 --> 03:11.365
- I'm with Zari.

03:11.408 --> 03:14.063
Behrad.
- Who's Behrad?

03:14.106 --> 03:15.238
I did not come back from hell

03:15.282 --> 03:16.718
to take a number
and wait my turn.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.372
- He is my brother,

03:18.415 --> 03:19.677
and he's part of the team
that found the rings.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.201
We're getting him back first.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.811
- Okay, stop, stop.
Everybody, stop arguing.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.508
You're all gonna get a chance.
But Sara's in a coma.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.944
Charlie's gonna
weave her out first.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.949
- All right, enough!
Come on, guys.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.865
This is exactly why I should've
left the damn thing broken.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.694
Okay, I'm gonna choose.
It's Behrad.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.827
Now goggles on.
And let's get going.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.795
Okay.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.545
The ring of Clotho,
the maker of threads,

04:01.589 --> 04:03.373
and extremely rad dresser.

04:06.768 --> 04:11.381
The ring of Lachesis,
the weaver of destinies

04:11.425 --> 04:13.514
and manipulative control freak.

04:15.385 --> 04:19.128
And the ring of Atropos,
the cutter of threads

04:19.171 --> 04:21.696
and a heartless psychopath.

04:48.679 --> 04:49.941
Okay.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.638
I see Behrad's thread.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.989
Well, it's a bit
of a tangled mess.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.817
It's probably 'cause
of all the time travel,

05:39.861 --> 05:41.384
but I think it'll be all right.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.349
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.178
- All right.
- What the hell?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.181
Gideon, status.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.140
Gideon?

06:42.184 --> 06:43.707
- Still assessing
the damage, Ms. Sharpe.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.492
Running on back-up power.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.020
- I'm sorry, Z.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.196
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.633
- Okay, so we try again.
- I said it didn't work.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.376
I never tried to use the Loom
without my sisters.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.682
I guess I need them.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.248
- Then let me try it.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.120
- Lachesis said she was
preparing me to be a Fate.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.991
Maybe, I can--

07:07.035 --> 07:08.776
- Yeah, go ahead, if you want
to burn up from the inside.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.473
- Okay.
What are we supposed to do?

07:10.517 --> 07:11.953
- Right now we're
just gonna sit tight

07:11.996 --> 07:13.215
and try to fix the ship.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.479
- Well, that's great.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.220
- I could do some research
back at the house.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.570
See if there isn't another way
to harness the rings.

07:20.614 --> 07:23.268
I could use
another set of eyes.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.227
- Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
until Behrad's back.

07:25.270 --> 07:29.057
- Wait, so I left an empire
in hell for "sit tight"?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.494
For "do some research"?

07:31.538 --> 07:33.104
Not good enough.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.150
- Apologies, but no one's
going anywhere.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.979
The energy burst created
an anti-chronotomic field.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.763
Time travel functions
are off-line.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.939
- So no jumpships?
No time couriers?

07:41.983 --> 07:43.506
- All out of commission.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.421
- Great.
- Hmm, we're stuck.

07:47.423 --> 07:50.774
- Why are the lights out?
- Ship better not be broken.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.820
- Unfortunately, I am.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.605
I was damaged in an explosion
caused by the Loom of Fate.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.041
- You're kidding me.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.217
I promised the kid
we'd time travel.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.828
Now she's gonna fail her exam.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.830
- No, it's fine.
I'll be okay.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.745
- We have to find you
a room to study in.

08:06.398 --> 08:09.967
- Um, did the computer
just say "Loom of Fate"?

08:14.058 --> 08:18.410
Things are really bad, baby.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.543
The ship's broken,

08:20.587 --> 08:22.371
the Loom backfired
and almost killed Charlie,

08:22.414 --> 08:25.243
everybody's bickering.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.508
The chances of getting Behrad
back have never felt more slim.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.773
We could really use
your vision.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.254
I could really use you.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.046
- Oh, my God.
Sara, you're awake.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.445
Ava?

08:53.489 --> 08:55.186
I can't see anything.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.188
- Gideon, what's wrong
with her eyes?

08:57.232 --> 08:59.321
- Unfortunately, Ms. Sharpe,
at my current power levels,

08:59.364 --> 09:01.453
I am unable
to offer a prognosis.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.846
I'm sorry.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.500
- You're sorry?
What are you talking about?

09:04.544 --> 09:05.849
She's blind.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.285
Reroute some power, Gideon.
Do something.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.983
- Ava, shh.
It's okay, all right?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.550
It's probably just temporary.
- What if it's not?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.421
Lay back.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.857
- Who knows what else
is wrong with you?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.001
- Sara?

09:40.231 --> 09:41.581
- You were startled
when we touched.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.714
What happened?
- Nothing.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.237
- Are you hiding something
from me?

09:46.281 --> 09:48.413
- Always.
- Come on, Sara.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.415
- Babe, it was just
a weird reaction

09:50.459 --> 09:52.374
to waking up from a coma.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.897
- Whoa.
No, no, no, no.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.899
Where do you think
you're going? You can't see.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.248
- I trained in a blindfold
for weeks

09:57.292 --> 09:58.685
in the League of Assassins.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.600
And nobody knows
how to fix the ship like I do.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.993
Except for maybe Ray and Jax.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.952
And Rip and Stein.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.214
I guess Behrad's
not bad either.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.868
But you know what?

10:07.911 --> 10:10.479
None of them are walking
through that door, so let's go.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.396
So what did I miss?

10:14.439 --> 10:17.225
- Oh, nothing much, actually.
Just, uh...

10:17.268 --> 10:20.184
Hey, Mick.
- Hi.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.621
Oh, uh, Lita.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.753
This is Sara Lance,
the captain.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.495
Sara, this is Lita, my kid.

10:26.538 --> 10:29.803
- Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.286
- It's really cool

10:35.330 --> 10:37.767
that there's a woman
in charge here.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.639
Uh, what? Sorry.

10:39.682 --> 10:40.988
- I just said that
it's really cool

10:41.031 --> 10:43.033
that there's a woman
in charge here.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.428
- Uh-huh, uh, yes.
- Good to see you.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.082
Come on.
- Yes, it is.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.564
- What are you not telling me?
- What are you not telling me?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.044
There's a kid on the ship?
- I--

10:55.742 --> 10:57.874
- And a dog?
Ava.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.095
Gary has
an emotional-support animal.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.140
He had a signed letter.
- That's not a thing.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.881
- I don't know, baby.
Now come here.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.198
- Is that Behrad?

11:17.241 --> 11:18.416
He sounds like
a pretty nice guy.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.940
Were you two close?

11:22.638 --> 11:25.423
- No, but we were
starting to be.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.472
I only just learned about
this big life he was living.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.780
And then I lost him.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.217
But I'm getting him back, so...

11:36.260 --> 11:40.961
- Yeah, about that, I think
I might have a way to do it.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.486
- I'm listening.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.966
- You know, I think
I'm probably good

11:46.009 --> 11:47.532
for my test tomorrow.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.273
I'd kind of just like
to look around the ship.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.971
- Uh-uh.
You got to hit the books.

11:51.014 --> 11:54.975
Oh, punched him.
Elbowed him.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.978
Ooh, made out with her.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.197
- Okay, smart guy.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.678
We're studying
the French Revolution.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.027
- I've heard of it.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.812
- So I have to compare

12:05.855 --> 12:08.162
and contrast the American
Declaration of Independence

12:08.205 --> 12:12.514
and the French Declaration
of Rights of Man and Citizen.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.951
- Right.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.693
- So does anybody
on the ship know history?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.566
- I know a guy.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.264
- Did I hear someone say

12:23.307 --> 12:25.396
the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and Citizen?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.050
Hi.
Dr. Nathaniel Heywood.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.531
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.012
Now, while, technically,
I am a doctor,

12:32.055 --> 12:34.884
you can call me "Professor"...

12:34.928 --> 12:39.454
or Steel
because I turn into it.

12:40.977 --> 12:45.155
- Whoa, you're the coolest
professor I've ever met.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.591
- Most likely.
Yeah.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.811
- All right.
Let's study.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.596
- Well, we can't study
without snacks, right?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.729
Gideon makes the best snacks.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.035
- Really?
Can we have ants on a log?

12:55.078 --> 12:56.253
- Ants on a--

12:56.297 --> 12:58.081
Mick, can you be
an absolute peach

12:58.125 --> 13:00.127
and run to the fabricator
for us?

13:10.398 --> 13:13.836
- Ah, what's happening with
your sight is a mystery, love.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.838
Are you experiencing
any more effects?

13:21.975 --> 13:24.847
No, nothing.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.762
- Oh, well, we'll just have
to wait and see, then.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.852
Ah, there is one other matter
to discuss.

13:29.896 --> 13:34.770
Astra Logue is on the ship.
- What?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.164
Ava?
- Uh, sorry, babe.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.731
But there was just never
a good time to tell you.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.429
She was only supposed
to be here temporarily,

13:41.472 --> 13:42.560
and then the Loom didn't work.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.171
- She cannot be on the ship.

13:44.214 --> 13:47.609
I mean, what if she goes on
a stabbing spree?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.045
- A stabbing spree?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.612
Well, that seems
a little excessive, honey.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.961
- Look, she's made her choice.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.876
She's decided to throw in
with us now.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.965
Why would you doubt her words?
- Look, I don't know, okay?

13:56.009 --> 13:59.012
It's just...
It's a feeling.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.493
John, I need you
by her side 24/7.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.581
- Fine.

14:05.757 --> 14:09.500
- What if Charlie
just wasn't warmed up?

14:09.544 --> 14:11.894
She tried to reweave
the most complicated thread

14:11.938 --> 14:13.330
right out the gate.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.594
What if she tries
with an easier thread,

14:16.638 --> 14:18.640
one that hasn't been
complicated

14:18.683 --> 14:22.644
by, well, time travel?

14:22.687 --> 14:26.604
- Like your mother's.
- Exactly.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.781
If she succeeds
on an easy thread like hers,

14:29.825 --> 14:33.263
she might be ready
to try Behrad's again.

14:33.307 --> 14:37.528
The thing is, if it comes
from me, they might not buy it.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.183
- But if it comes from me...

14:41.924 --> 14:43.578
They just might.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.714
- Again, I do apologize

14:49.758 --> 14:52.674
that the fabricator is
not functioning, Mr. Rory.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.156
- Oh, man.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.288
It must have been damaged
in the explosion.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.163
Oh.
Ants on a log?

15:06.035 --> 15:09.604
Are those for sharesies?
- My kid.

15:09.647 --> 15:12.781
- Oh, I see what's
happening here.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.652
You're new to this
whole parenting thing.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.959
You know what?

15:17.003 --> 15:21.529
I think you need some advice
from the Papa Gare.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.705
Parenting is about
doing the crap work,

15:23.748 --> 15:25.141
no matter how degrading,

15:25.185 --> 15:27.883
and never, ever once
hearing a word of thanks.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.451
But you'll know in your heart
that they appreciate it,

15:30.494 --> 15:33.062
even if the thought
never crosses their mind.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.934
Isn't that right, Gary Junior?

15:34.977 --> 15:39.808
Oh, "doodie calls,"
as they say.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.202
Crap work.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.127
What is that?

15:57.913 --> 16:00.089
- Okay.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.179
I've removed panel 16-QW-45G.

16:03.223 --> 16:07.444
- Mm, no, I'm pretty sure
I said 16-QW-45T.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.577
- No, you said G.
- No, 16--

16:09.620 --> 16:11.622
- Okay, yep.
Finding T.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.189
- Sara.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.887
Caught a case
of blindness, I hear?

16:15.931 --> 16:19.761
- Yeah, and while Gideon's
down, uh, I'm stuck like this.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.459
But it's no big deal.
- No big deal?

16:22.503 --> 16:24.940
Right, you're the first mortal
to ever see a god's true form

16:24.984 --> 16:26.420
and live to tell the tale.

16:26.463 --> 16:30.424
And that is no big deal.
- It's no big deal.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.253
- So nothing else has
been happening, right?

16:33.296 --> 16:36.038
There's no other side effects?

16:36.082 --> 16:39.041
Look, I know you're not
being honest with me, Sara.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.825
I just want to help.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.785
- What is she
talking about, babe?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.656
Look, it's nothing, okay?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.702
I just...

16:47.745 --> 16:50.400
I didn't want to upset anyone.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.489
- What's so upsetting?

16:54.491 --> 16:58.582
- When I touch somebody,
I see people stabbed to death.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.063
But it's probably just
some subconscious fear

17:01.107 --> 17:02.238
that's been kicked up
by the coma.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.631
It's like a--
it's a nightmare.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.806
- You've lost
one kind of vision,

17:04.849 --> 17:05.981
and you've gained another.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.417
Sara, you're seeing the future.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.203
- Look, they're
just nightmares, Charlie.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.295
This can't be the future,
all right?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.210
It's not possible.
- Why?

17:17.253 --> 17:19.864
You're a Paragon of Destiny who
got radiated by godly light.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.170
Why is it so impossible

17:21.214 --> 17:22.780
that you've gained
the gift of foresight?

17:22.824 --> 17:25.000
- Because we don't all die.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.480
- We?
What do you mean?

17:26.523 --> 17:29.309
Like, we die
in, like, 50 years?

17:29.352 --> 17:33.487
Or we die with me
wearing this exact outfit?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.493
- Option two.
- It's got to be Astra.

17:39.536 --> 17:42.104
- Charlie, would you stop
with the Astra thing?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.627
She saved our lives
in hell, okay?

17:43.671 --> 17:45.194
I'm not just gonna
assume the worst.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.283
What, that she's some
manipulative psychopath?

17:47.327 --> 17:48.937
- Well, she just tried
to manipulate me

17:48.980 --> 17:50.591
into coming in here

17:50.634 --> 17:52.462
and begging Charlie
to use the Loom again, so...

17:52.506 --> 17:53.811
- Okay, well,
that's not a crime.

17:53.855 --> 17:57.119
- Guys, the rings.
They're gone.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
I found this
in the trash chute.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
- Okay, that is a crime.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.125
- Gidget, play back
internal monitoring

18:03.169 --> 18:04.996
of the parlor, please.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.695
- My internal monitoring
subsystems have been disabled.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.827
I'm afraid we have
a saboteur on board.

18:09.871 --> 18:13.092
- Okay, now I'm starting
to assume the worst.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.360
-  Well, this was
inevitable, wasn't it?

18:23.363 --> 18:24.973
The first thing
that goes wrong,

18:25.016 --> 18:26.670
and you all point
the finger at me.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.237
- You know what, Astra?
Slow your roll.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.196
You wanted the rings,
and now they're missing, so...

18:30.239 --> 18:32.372
- You're the only person who
doesn't belong on this ship.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.069
- Happily.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.853
- Look, I was with her
the whole time, all right?

18:35.897 --> 18:36.854
She never took the rings.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.552
And besides,

18:38.595 --> 18:40.423
how is she supposed
to have sabotaged Gideon, eh?

18:40.467 --> 18:42.033
- We have no idea, John.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.818
That's why she's here
and not out the airlock, okay?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.515
Come on, babe.
- Sorry, Astra.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.127
You just spent too much time
with my sisters to be trusted.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.782
- I was shown
more hospitality

18:51.826 --> 18:54.220
in the deepest pits of hell
than on this ship of fools.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.309
- Yeah.
Just sit tight, all right?

18:56.352 --> 18:58.746
I got just the spell
to track this saboteur.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.487
- I never should have
trusted you.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.752
- Did you really, though?

19:04.795 --> 19:07.798
Or did you just, uh, run
out of other options?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.937
- And then there's Zari.
She's from the future.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.548
She's supes cute,
and she can control air.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.202
- What?
- Yep.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.422
- Ants on a log.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.728
- Everybody here
has a superpower.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.427
Do you have a superpower?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.386
- I have this.
- Your gun?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.475
- Uh, yes.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.217
- Your superpower is
that you shoot a gun?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.871
- It shoots fire.
- No, I know.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.090
I don't like any guns.
- Why not?

19:39.134 --> 19:40.788
- I marched in protest of them.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.659
Do you know how dangerous
that thing is?

19:42.703 --> 19:44.139
- Well, that's the point.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.184
Lita...

19:45.227 --> 19:46.707
Shut up.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.404
You know, if it wasn't
for your pops here,

19:48.448 --> 19:50.319
we wouldn't be able
to travel through time.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.496
Mick keeps the lights on.
- The lights are off.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.891
- Well, that's
an unfortunate coincidence.

19:56.934 --> 20:00.024
However, Mick funds
this whole operation

20:00.068 --> 20:03.332
through the simple act
of stealing.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.378
- Oh, didn't you go
to prison for stealing?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.249
Isn't that why
you missed my childhood?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.470
-  Damn it, Mick.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.123
Sometimes they're
just souvenirs.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.343
Like, Mick,
did you happen to steal

20:14.387 --> 20:18.782
any French Revolution souvenirs
from Marie Antoinette?

20:20.436 --> 20:22.438
Say yes.

20:22.482 --> 20:25.528
- Yes, yes.
Yes, I did.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.964
- Really?
Can I see them?

20:27.008 --> 20:28.227
- Really?

20:30.272 --> 20:31.882
Come with me.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.061
- Not bad, Nate.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.325
Not bad at all.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.153
Mm.
Not bad, Mick.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.678
Not bad at all.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.120
- Well...
- Yeah, definitely sabotage.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.557
- Yeah.
Thought so.

20:54.601 --> 20:58.169
- Ooh, what happened here?
- Hmm, we have a saboteur.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.302
all: Hmm.
- I think I know who it is.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.262
- Hmm.
Oh, come on!

21:06.743 --> 21:08.571
- Oh, hello, Zari.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.270
- Hello, Astra.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.447
Look, I'm sorry
you are locked up.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.884
- Well, at least we have
that in common.

21:18.712 --> 21:22.324
- We also both lost a relative
who we want back

21:22.368 --> 21:25.893
and got screwed
when the Loom failed.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.678
- Hmm.
One of us more than the other.

21:32.378 --> 21:36.860
Okay, I know John is out there
trying to prove your innocence.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.646
But we both know how much
you wanted those rings,

21:39.689 --> 21:42.736
so why not just give them back?

21:42.779 --> 21:46.261
Oh, wait. I see now.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.176
You think you're here
to interrogate me,

21:48.219 --> 21:51.179
but that's not why
you're really here.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.789
- No, that's literally
why I'm here--

21:52.833 --> 21:54.356
- You're here

21:54.400 --> 21:56.880
because you've got Nate
wrapped around your finger.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.752
And you thought you had John

21:58.795 --> 22:01.363
wrapped around
your finger, too.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.323
But you don't.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.369
What are you talking about?

22:07.413 --> 22:10.503
- When we were choosing
who to weave first,

22:10.546 --> 22:13.375
he picked my mother.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.073
Not Behrad.
- Hmm.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.337
You think you clocked something
between John and I,

22:18.380 --> 22:21.470
and now you're using it
to manipulate me.

22:21.514 --> 22:25.735
Wow, you are devious.
- So are you.

22:25.779 --> 22:29.217
So why don't you use that
devious little brain of yours

22:29.260 --> 22:32.655
and figure out
who really took the rings.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.224
- You think you can repair
the security cameras

22:36.267 --> 22:37.747
to find our thief?

22:37.791 --> 22:41.011
- Maybe, but whoever did this
left a lot of damage

22:41.055 --> 22:42.752
and not a lot of clues.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.275
- Hmm.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.842
- Oh, it seems
we've all arrived

22:45.886 --> 22:47.975
at the scene of the crime.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.585
Well, this crime anyway.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.371
- You know, we could, um--
we could just work together

22:52.414 --> 22:53.894
to find our ring thief.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.331
- Yeah, and how can I hope
to defend Astra

22:56.375 --> 22:58.507
by teaming up
with her accusers?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.248
- We're all looking
for the truth, John.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.424
- Yeah, well, some of us can
just see the situation

23:02.468 --> 23:04.252
a little more clearly
than others.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.094
- You okay?
What's wrong?

23:20.137 --> 23:23.445
- I did--
It was me.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.404
I kill everyone.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.845
- Baby, you are
an amazing assassin, okay?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.324
But you're blind,
and now you've warned us.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.065
The idea of you
killing everyone is--

23:35.109 --> 23:36.937
- Arrogant, delusional,
and just plain rude.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.504
- Yeah, and you're not
that kind of person.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.549
- Something is going on
with me, all right?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.377
I went
from seeing you all dead

23:42.421 --> 23:45.075
to being the one responsible
for it, and I don't know why.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.513
Look, you have to figure out
what is going on.

23:47.556 --> 23:50.124
Look, and until then,
I cannot be trusted, all right?

23:50.167 --> 23:51.821
So promise me,

23:51.865 --> 23:54.215
no matter what I say, you
will not let me out of here.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
- Okay, I promise, honey.
I love you, all right?

23:56.217 --> 23:57.566
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.829
Just please take a breath.

24:03.398 --> 24:06.140
- And, uh, what exactly are we
getting to the bottom of?

24:06.183 --> 24:09.665
-  I have no idea.
She has lost her damn mind.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.020
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.505
Whoa.

24:28.597 --> 24:31.513
You really like to steal.
- Don't tell your mom.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
Here.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.343
This belonged
to the headless lady.

24:39.129 --> 24:43.394
- So I really dig the whole
Scrooge McDuck aesthetic,

24:43.438 --> 24:45.222
but why not put your money
in a bank?

24:45.266 --> 24:49.183
- A bank?
Too easy to rob.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.881
- Hold on.
All of your money is here?

24:51.925 --> 24:54.754
What if somebody robs this?
- Let them try.

24:54.797 --> 24:57.365
- What about compound interest?

24:57.408 --> 25:00.281
Okay, how much money
is in here?

25:00.324 --> 25:02.065
- A million?
Billion.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.590
- And in ten years, how much
is that gonna be worth?

25:06.113 --> 25:08.507
The same.
It's gonna be worth the same.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.379
If you invest it,
it'll be worth way more.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.686
- Sounds complicated.

25:13.729 --> 25:17.907
- What if you take the
time machine back to the start

25:17.951 --> 25:21.432
of the New York Stock Exchange
and invest it all then?

25:21.476 --> 25:24.479
We could go and buy Manhattan
in the 1600s.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.437
We can invent Bitcoin.

25:26.481 --> 25:30.746
We can become partners
in getting frickin' rich.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.401
Ow.
What the hell?

25:33.444 --> 25:35.838
- Room's off limits.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.580
- So we're finally connecting
and you're shutting me out?

25:38.624 --> 25:40.451
You're a terrible father.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.718
- What are you doing?

25:45.761 --> 25:47.763
- Looking for footage
of you stealing the rings.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.591
It doesn't exist.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.811
Besides, I thought
the cameras were sabotaged.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.553
- Mm, I'm hacking
the backup feed.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.206
- You hack?
- Hmm.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.993
Not so much me, but a version
of me that used to exist.

26:00.036 --> 26:03.605
- Do you think I could talk
to this other version of you?

26:03.649 --> 26:07.609
Maybe she'd trust me.
- Shush, she wouldn't.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.872
You know, you could
gain trust the normal way

26:09.916 --> 26:12.483
by being trustworthy.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.485
- Well, things are
getting crazy out there.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.226
Sara just locked herself up.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.620
- Is locking someone up
her solution to everything?

26:18.664 --> 26:19.969
- Mm...

26:20.013 --> 26:21.362
- She had a vision
that she killed us all.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.059
- Oh.
- Great, so I'm exonerated?

26:23.103 --> 26:24.583
I can go?
- Mm, no.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.975
You're staying in time-out

26:26.019 --> 26:27.847
until we find out
where these rings are.

26:29.457 --> 26:32.678
Huh, speaking of which,
backup feed is up.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.032
Oh, my God.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.816
- Charlie, why'd
you take the rings?

26:40.860 --> 26:44.994
- Mate, that wasn't me.
I mean, it was, but it wasn't.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.431
- Ooh, that does not
look good for me.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.657
- You disabled the cameras?
Are you two in cahoots?

26:55.701 --> 26:57.485
both: No.
- Obviously n--

26:57.528 --> 26:59.922
Why would I hack into footage
that incriminates myself?

26:59.966 --> 27:00.967
- I don't know.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.973
I just destroyed
the food fabricator,

27:07.016 --> 27:08.801
which makes no sense
'cause I love food.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.933
- And let me guess, you
don't remember that either, eh?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.021
- No.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.157
- Oh.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.985
- I am guessing
you also don't remember that.

27:19.028 --> 27:21.117
- I can't believe that
I flushed the Loom of Fate.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.250
- Well, it's all right there
in the surveillance footage

27:23.293 --> 27:25.774
Gideon apparently records
of our bathroom.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.210
W--
- Ew.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.648
- Well, clearly
you're all the culprits,

27:29.691 --> 27:32.955
which obviously exonerates me.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.391
- No.
Still no.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.480
- Yeah, this could all be
mind control.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.440
- It's--
You think I'm behind it?

27:39.483 --> 27:41.529
all: Yeah.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.710
Who's there?

27:53.323 --> 27:55.630
- It's Papa Gare to the rescue.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.806
- Damn it, Gary.
What are you doing in here?

27:57.850 --> 27:59.460
- Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna let you out.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.070
I'm not a crazy person--
- No, I'm serious.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.942
You cannot be in here.
It is not safe.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.772
- Well, neither is
solitary confinement.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.557
- Gary, what are...
What?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.429
- Which is why,
after careful consideration,

28:12.473 --> 28:15.998
I've decided you need
my emotional-support dog

28:16.042 --> 28:17.826
more than I do.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.786
- I mean, I guess...

28:20.829 --> 28:23.310
I guess it is
kind of comforting.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.007
- Just promise me
you'll treat him

28:25.051 --> 28:26.835
like the little angel he is.

28:26.879 --> 28:30.926
- Kill him.
- Wait.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.189
Who--who said that?
- Said what?

28:33.233 --> 28:35.670
Gary Junior, stop barking.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.761
- Gary can't hear me.
Now kill him.

28:44.374 --> 28:48.117
Ah, good girl.
Now kill them all.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.909
- Which is why,
after careful consideration,

28:56.952 --> 29:00.129
I've decided you need
my emotional-support dog--

29:00.173 --> 29:03.002
- Wait, wait.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.438
Oh, my God.
It's the dog.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.617
Your dog is a demon, and it's
gonna tell me to kill everyone.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.271
But you know what?

29:11.314 --> 29:13.752
I am not gonna listen.
I'm not gonna listen, dog.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.189
- I'd appreciate it
if you didn't raise your voice.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.583
Gary Junior is
a very nervous pee-er.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.680
- Hey!
Hey, where is everyone?

29:29.724 --> 29:31.073
- Sara, Sara, Sara.
Hey, hey.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.292
- Oh, bollocks.
How did you escape?

29:32.335 --> 29:34.903
- Hey, look,
I figured it out.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.340
It's Gary's dog. He's gonna
make me kill everyone.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.864
- Okay, babe.
Just calm down.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.561
You told us not to listen
to anything you say.

29:40.604 --> 29:41.562
The dog?
- Look, I know.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.259
But just listen.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.000
I can prove to you that I am
telling the truth, all right?

29:45.044 --> 29:46.697
I had a vision
that I killed Gary,

29:46.741 --> 29:48.525
and then in real time,
I saved him.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.440
And the fact that
he is alive right now

29:50.484 --> 29:53.095
proves that I am not lying.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.836
- You were right
to lock yourself up, love.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.751
- Listen, I know
that I sound crazy,

29:56.795 --> 29:58.144
but you just take me
to that dog,

29:58.187 --> 30:00.276
and you will see that I am not.

30:09.024 --> 30:12.071
- Gary, where is Gary Junior?
- No idea.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.987
He ran off shortly after
she screamed at him.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.858
- What?
I was saving your life.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.294
- From who?
- From me!

30:18.338 --> 30:19.992
- Okay, enough.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.037
John, stay with Sara.
Gary, let's go find the dog.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.648
- Yes.
Teaming up like old times.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.911
- Ew.
Whoa, gross.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.129
Can you wash
your hands first, please?

30:27.173 --> 30:29.610
Okay.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.268
Hmm, that's weird.

30:35.311 --> 30:37.748
- What the hell is
Gary Junior doing there?

30:37.792 --> 30:39.663
- Wait, go back
to the other footage.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.320
There.
Zoom out.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.896
Look, he's there
every bloody time.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.332
- Oh.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.858
- Junior. Here, boy.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.990
Where are you?

31:02.034 --> 31:04.123
- Okay, he's not ship-broken.
He doesn't come when called.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.387
Where the hell did you get him?
- I don't want to say.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.779
- Gary, my girlfriend's
gone crazy,

31:08.823 --> 31:10.520
and I'm looking for a dog
to prove it.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.261
I am beyond mad.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.437
- Fine.
- Hmm?

31:14.481 --> 31:17.658
- I rescued him.
- Oh.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.356
- From hell.
- You adopted a hellhound?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.967
- Well, when you say it
like that...

31:22.010 --> 31:23.272
I saw him when we got Astra.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.144
He was all alone.
I felt bad for him.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.233
- Oh, my God.
Sara was right.

31:27.276 --> 31:30.323
This dog is making us go crazy.
This is absurd.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.933
This is more absurd
than that StabCast I did

31:31.977 --> 31:33.021
on the Son of Sam.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.197
Wait. Uh...

31:35.241 --> 31:37.504
What does "Son of Sam" mean?

31:37.547 --> 31:40.115
'Cause I-I feel
like Gary Junior

31:40.159 --> 31:42.509
kept saying that to me
in his barks.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.467
- What? No, it was a guy
in the '70s in New York.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.991
He killed a bunch of people

31:46.034 --> 31:47.470
and later said that
a dog made him do it.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.994
- Oh, my God.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.953
You adopted
Son of Sam's demon dog.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.216
Oh, my God.

31:54.260 --> 31:57.089
At least I didn't buy
from a breeder.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.097
- Whatever he says,
don't listen to him.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.012
- All I hear is
annoying barking.

32:07.055 --> 32:10.102
- All I hear is why
I should murder you all.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.930
And he's making
some very good points.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.585
- Nate.
- Nate.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.371
Nate, d--
No.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.850
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

32:23.854 --> 32:25.465
- Was I trying to murder you
with a stool?

32:25.508 --> 32:26.770
- Yeah.
- Yes.

32:26.814 --> 32:30.035
I am so sorry, guys.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.384
- What the hell
are you doing?

32:31.427 --> 32:33.342
- It's a whistle
only dogs can hear.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.605
- Why are you doing this to us?

32:35.649 --> 32:39.174
- Because I hate hats.
I hate stupid ties.

32:39.218 --> 32:42.177
And I hate Gary!

32:42.221 --> 32:46.007
- But I rescued you from hell.
- From hell?

32:46.051 --> 32:48.140
Wait, are you working
for my sisters?

32:48.183 --> 32:52.622
- Uh, no, sweetheart.
I'm the Canine of Chaos.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.016
I was gonna have you
murder each other,

32:55.060 --> 32:58.977
but now I'm gonna
kill you myself!

33:05.418 --> 33:07.202
- Whoa.
- Get to the dais.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.639
- Don't let me out now.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.473
- Where'd he go?

33:17.517 --> 33:20.259
- What's that?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.359
- Yeah, it looks like
we owe you an apology, love.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.143
- Wait, that was Junior?

33:35.187 --> 33:38.103
- Well, let's just say Gary
has some explaining to do.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.887
Come on.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.759
Let's go stop this bloody thing
before it kills someone.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.546
- Gary, your hand's on my--

33:46.589 --> 33:48.113
Just move it.
- Sorry.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.854
- Ow, Gary, that hurts.
- Sorry.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.074
- Gary, your hand is
still on my--

33:53.118 --> 33:54.902
- No, I think that's me.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.512
- You can leave it
if you're comfortable.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.079
It really doesn't bother me.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.212
- Can I put my hand back?
- Man, shut up, Gary.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.778
- Why are you all acting like

34:01.822 --> 34:03.519
I brought the Son of Sam's dog
here on purpose?

34:03.563 --> 34:05.086
- That's who that demon is?
both: Yeah.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.740
- Let me out.
I will get rid of him.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.133
- How?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.395
- You still don't trust me,
do you?

34:09.438 --> 34:10.744
- No.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.311
- Ava, just let her out.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.877
If we'd listened to her
in the first place,

34:13.921 --> 34:15.618
we wouldn't be in this
hot, uncomfortable mess.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.229
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

34:17.272 --> 34:20.145
- Astra, I--

34:20.188 --> 34:23.365
- Huh. Whoa--
- Uh, yeah.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.628
Hey, I think you accidentally
put the force field back up.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.457
- I think she knows.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.287
- Oh, come on.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.115
- You've got to be kidding!

34:34.159 --> 34:35.638
- You really shouldn't mess

34:35.682 --> 34:39.120
with someone so comfortable
with torture.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.171
- Lita, open the door.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.912
- Go away, Becky.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.871
- I know what it's like
to be mad at your parents.

34:50.914 --> 34:53.003
I lit mine on fire.

34:53.047 --> 34:57.051
But let's talk about it.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.922
- We have nothing
to talk about.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.976
- This is taking too damn long.
We have to find that dog.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.412
- Yeah, don't I know it.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.022
And I could really use
another set of eyes.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.155
No offense.
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:14.199 --> 35:17.332
What if we can use my vision
to search the ship?

35:17.376 --> 35:18.899
- Yeah.
- Give me your hand.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.909
- Is it working?

35:28.952 --> 35:31.303
We have to get to the library.
- All right, come on.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.221
- Come on.
Open the door.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.188
- Lita!

35:54.021 --> 35:56.415
Get away from her,
you mangy mutt!

36:01.246 --> 36:05.946
You idiot.
I was born from fire!

36:25.400 --> 36:28.838
- What did you do?
- Ah! I told it to attack me.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.797
But at least I got you
to protect me.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.365
- John, I'm blind.
- But you're not deaf.

36:44.550 --> 36:45.768
- Now what?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.205
- Ah, to send the demon
to hell,

36:47.248 --> 36:48.641
I need to know
its true name.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.817
- Well, I'm pretty sure
it's not Gary Junior.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.036
- His name is Marchosias.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.083
- Astra, you dick!

37:05.919 --> 37:09.183
- No!

37:17.887 --> 37:20.150
- All right,
that should do it.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.674
Gideon, are we back online?

37:23.589 --> 37:25.939
- I'm happy to report
all functions are restored.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.724
- Ooh, you smell that?
- Oh, my God.

37:28.768 --> 37:29.943
What--

37:29.986 --> 37:31.771
- Gideon, what is that smell?

37:31.814 --> 37:33.773
- Gideon, did something die
in your ventilation system?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.254
- No, it's me.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.778
I had to scour every inch
of the waste disposal unit,

37:38.821 --> 37:40.867
but I found the rings.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.870
- Whoa, whoa.
Just hold on.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.699
- Ugh.
- Thanks, Gary.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.658
- Yeah, getting the rings was
a tough but fair punishment

37:49.702 --> 37:52.052
for letting a hellhound
onto the ship.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.401
- It's all right.
All is forgiven.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.621
You were obviously
mind-controlled.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.841
-  I wasn't.
- Hmm?

37:58.885 --> 38:01.366
I just thought
he was really cute.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.281
- Of course you did.
- Yeah.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.066
Well, this has been
very traumatic for me.

38:06.109 --> 38:09.243
So, once the time couriers
came back online,

38:09.287 --> 38:12.986
I got myself another
emotional-support animal.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.117
- You what?
- Oh, come on.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.554
- What?
- Oh, come on.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.860
- What is it?
- It's a "wittle wabbit."

38:17.904 --> 38:20.994
- Oh, babe,
it's actually really cute.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.953
- I've named him
Gary Junior II.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.390
- Please tell me
he's not from hell, though,

38:25.433 --> 38:26.869
because I'm gonna have to--

38:26.913 --> 38:28.393
- No, no, I wouldn't make
that mistake again.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.046
- Okay.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.222
- No, I got this "wittle" guy
from a mysterious carnie

38:32.266 --> 38:35.008
who warned me never
to feed him past midnight.

38:41.841 --> 38:45.671
- Is one of those for me?
- No, you're too young.

38:45.714 --> 38:49.457
- Oh, so now you obey the law.
- Never.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.553
You're my kid.
My responsibility.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.686
And I only want
what's best for you.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.516
I was a little harsh
before, and--

39:04.559 --> 39:06.866
- It's okay.
You saved my life.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.608
- It's no excuse.
Let me explain.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.830
Ah.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.529
"The life of a criminal
is a life of misery.

39:17.572 --> 39:18.878
"I've spent years in jail

39:18.921 --> 39:21.141
"thanks to some
red leather freak.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.534
So fast, that I couldn't--"

39:22.577 --> 39:24.274
- It's okay, it's okay.
I get it.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.667
You just don't want me

39:25.711 --> 39:28.366
to suffer in the ways
that you have.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.499
- Should I, um, stop reading?

39:31.543 --> 39:33.109
- We have a common interest,

39:33.153 --> 39:35.764
and I thought
we could bond over it.

39:35.808 --> 39:37.766
But I understand
why we shouldn't.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.815
- Right.
I'll take you home.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.469
- Why?

39:44.512 --> 39:46.340
I thought we were spending
the weekend together.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.821
- You want to stay?
- Yeah.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.650
Today wasn't so bad...

39:51.693 --> 39:53.129
Dad.

39:54.566 --> 39:57.090
- Hmm.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.700
Roller derby tomorrow.

39:58.744 --> 39:59.919
- No.
Absolutely not.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.529
- The mall?
- Definitely no.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.802
I see you're making
yourself comfortable.

40:13.846 --> 40:17.458
- You looking for John?
- No.

40:17.502 --> 40:20.026
I am looking for you.

40:20.069 --> 40:23.943
- Why?
We're not friends.

40:23.986 --> 40:27.076
I only saved your entire team
because it helped me.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.646
- And I only told Ava to let
you out because it helped us.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.822
- So we're even.
We're the same.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.433
No, girl.

40:35.476 --> 40:38.131
You released encores
onto the world

40:38.174 --> 40:40.394
just to get your own way.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.004
- So we're not even.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.398
We'll keep using each other
till it stops suiting us.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.400
I am comfortable with that.

40:48.663 --> 40:51.144
- I'm not.

40:51.187 --> 40:54.626
I don't know--let's see
if we can be more than that.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.543
Come on, let me show you
around this weirdo ship.

40:58.586 --> 41:00.240
- I'm good.

41:00.283 --> 41:03.069
Not planning on staying long.

41:03.112 --> 41:07.203
But you get points for trying.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.989
Okay.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.695
- You know, I was thinking
maybe later we could--

41:20.739 --> 41:22.175
- Try blindfolding you?

41:22.218 --> 41:23.785
- Stop reading my mind,
or it's gonna get--

41:23.829 --> 41:25.831
- Awesome?

41:25.874 --> 41:29.878
Okay, let's just fix you up.
Come on, baby.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.537
- Okay, Gideon.
Do your thing.

41:40.323 --> 41:41.760
- Scan complete.

41:41.803 --> 41:43.544
I do not detect
any abnormalities

41:43.588 --> 41:45.590
in Captain Lance's
ocular region.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.461
- What do you mean
no abnormalities?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.158
- Gideon, she's still blind.

41:49.202 --> 41:52.510
- I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.838
- Greg, move your head.
