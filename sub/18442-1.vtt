00:55.599 --> 00:58.698
Good afternoon.
I'm Glenn Russell,

00:58.733 --> 01:04.396
and is an honor to announce the trip
Starquest's inaugural program.

01:10.632 --> 01:14.129
It offers the best
Aerodynamic design

01:14.130 --> 01:17.229
to reduce
Fuel consumption;

01:17.263 --> 01:20.129
computerized controls
sophisticated

01:20.163 --> 01:25.361
and what we believe to be the experience
more pleasant to fly today.

01:29.830 --> 01:37.928
And now, at this point, I would like to
present chief pilot Joseph Franklin

01:37.962 --> 01:40.193
Bill Alexander and his copilot.

01:44.461 --> 01:46.526
Thank you very much!
-Joe, Joe!

01:46.560 --> 01:48.253
The Starquest boasts
be totally

01:48.254 --> 01:50.793
automatic since the
takeoff to landing.

01:50.828 --> 01:55.459
Are you afraid of this plan to replace it,
that replace all pilots?

01:55.494 --> 01:58.291
No, no. We love to fly.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.291
Also, you always
will need pilots.

02:00.326 --> 02:03.626
Who will point when you
are flying over the Grand Canyon?

02:19.625 --> 02:21.624
And here you are.

02:23.026 --> 02:24.189
Calm down!

02:24.224 --> 02:26.389
Sorry ... was reflex.

02:26.424 --> 02:28.056
Reflection?

02:28.091 --> 02:30.789
Great reflection. You will
it is our security?

02:30.824 --> 02:32.823
No.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.055
Something special?

02:35.090 --> 02:37.055
Paperwork. Diplomatic thing.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.288
None of your business ... whoever.

02:40.323 --> 02:42.287
Okay, you two are good.

02:42.322 --> 02:43.662
-Thanks, man.
"Sure.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.321
Take care.

02:47.122 --> 02:50.187
That sucks you should
stop at the limit, Gina.

02:50.222 --> 02:52.453
Yes, well ...

02:52.488 --> 02:54.701
I feel that the Secret Service
get me out of my field

02:54.702 --> 02:57.053
sending to the safety
the President's brother.

02:57.088 --> 03:02.419
-So the ball will never get me.
-Actually, it would be the right field.

03:02.453 --> 03:04.452
Is.

03:05.487 --> 03:08.086
There you are

03:08.120 --> 03:10.119
Take care.
Thank you.

03:32.985 --> 03:34.950
Hello?

03:34.985 --> 03:36.950
Hi, dear. You watching?

03:36.985 --> 03:39.750
Hi! No, nothing in the news yet.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.583
Just some pretty pictures of the plane.

03:42.617 --> 03:45.016
Gwen is looking at the conference
press onto YouTube.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.083
What the ...?
43rd
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,215
Hey! Look at the verbiage, young lady.

03:49.249 --> 03:51.215
I really wanted to be here.

03:51.249 --> 03:53.215
I wish we were there, too.

03:53.249 --> 03:56.248
No, you do not.
-Yeah, right.

03:56.282 --> 03:58.048
Oh, man. I still can not find.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.047
Hey Gwen, prepare to go to school.

04:00.082 --> 04:02.047
Joe, I gotta go.

04:02.082 --> 04:07.081
I love you. Take care of everything, and I
I'll be back for the weekend.

04:07.115 --> 04:10.113
-Right. I love you.
-Bye.

05:07.710 --> 05:10.108
This was a TV interview today.

05:10.142 --> 05:12.208
Joe, you got the look on the radio.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.507
Someone stole all
our equipment.

05:20.540 --> 05:23.907
Let us, Joe. Forget the crap
flight old-fashioned.

05:23.941 --> 05:26.007
This is not fly, Billy.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.607
This is videogame.

05:28.641 --> 05:31.723
Joe, you're a grouchy,
grizzled, old Gaga.

05:31.724 --> 05:34.739
Just sit back and enjoy
your retirement.

05:34.773 --> 05:38.271
Counting the minutes. Counting the minutes
until he can retire away from you

05:38.306 --> 05:42.005
with my wife, children, in a
beach in Barbados. And without Billy.

05:42.039 --> 05:45.038
It looks delicious. Okay,
Let us prepare.

05:52.438 --> 05:55.604
-Hydraulic ...
-Adjusted.

05:55.638 --> 05:57.604
Emergency-Lights ...
-Prepared.

05:57.638 --> 05:59.536
E-key phone ...
-Disabled.
66th
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,536
Anti-Ice System ...

06:01.571 --> 06:04.603
And no. This should be disabled,
and is disabled.

06:04.637 --> 06:08.202
I know how to fly this thing.
Do not worry, right?

06:08.236 --> 06:10.769
Ladies and gentlemen,
're number one for takeoff.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.835
Make sure your belts
Security is tight

06:12.869 --> 06:14.835
, and their chairs are upright

06:14.869 --> 06:16.868
, and in the locked position.

06:18.103 --> 06:21.602
Time to shake. Remember,
five minutes in and out.

07:40.228 --> 07:42.194
-Molly? Molly ...?
Where's your ...?

07:42.228 --> 07:45.094
Go kids!
Children go, run!

07:45.128 --> 07:49.193
No. Run! No, no!

07:49.953 --> 07:51.226
Children go, run!

07:51.327 --> 07:53.226
No, no!

07:55.127 --> 07:58.025
You bastard!

07:58.060 --> 07:58.946
-Remember ...
-No!

07:58.947 --> 08:00.225
If you cause a problem,

08:00.259 --> 08:03.258
will be much worse for their children.

08:13.113 --> 08:14.157
"Come on.
-Go!

08:14.192 --> 08:17.423
Come on.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.957

08:22.625 --> 08:24.156

08:26.191 --> 08:28.389

08:28.423 --> 08:29.422
Tie the children!

08:29.457 --> 08:31.456
No!

08:32.423 --> 08:33.722
-No!
-Hey!

08:33.756 --> 08:35.755
Do not forget ...

08:47.377 --> 08:49.121
You are hurting my arm!

08:54.688 --> 08:57.187
-Mother ...
-No!

09:04.621 --> 09:07.186
Stay down, guys, look ...

09:09.887 --> 09:11.852
We have problems.

09:11.887 --> 09:13.886
Damn!

09:15.752 --> 09:18.185
Go, go, go, go!

09:18.219 --> 09:20.218
Hey, go! Go!

09:46.916 --> 09:48.915

10:04.414 --> 10:05.681
Quiet!

10:05.715 --> 10:07.714
Shoot him!
103rd
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,479
No!

10:18.913 --> 10:20.912
Calm down, Fred!

10:31.446 --> 10:35.444
Yes.

10:45.711 --> 10:49.710
Melville. What? Damn!

10:49.744 --> 10:52.743
Make sure the residents were there.
I'm heading.

10:55.077 --> 11:00.075
-Let me know so I have something new.
-Right.

11:03.677 --> 11:05.675
FBI agent Melville ...
Julius Reed, the Secret Service.

11:05.709 --> 11:07.675
What is the situation?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.675
The maid of Franklin,
Molly, is dead.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.507
We seek fingerprints, and we
begin to investigate the neighborhood.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.074
Great. There is something that
can help me with this?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.974
What about the surveillance system?
Already there?

11:18.008 --> 11:20.874
That surveillance system?

11:20.908 --> 11:23.973
-Go children, run!
6-We install monitoring cameras.

11:24.007 --> 11:27.806
-So should show everything that happened.
-No!

11:27.840 --> 11:30.372
Beauty. The way these
guys are heads down,

11:30.406 --> 11:35.405

get a photo for identification.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.705
Yes, sir, Director.

11:40.739 --> 11:43.237
I understand that you need
inform the President.

11:43.272 --> 11:47.237
Yes, sir. Send details as soon
we have more to continue.

11:47.272 --> 11:51.804
Yes, sir ... Yes, sir;
we find them.

11:51.838 --> 11:53.837
Let's find them.

11:56.004 --> 11:58.003
Fortunately, they are still alive.

12:02.104 --> 12:04.103
Expert!

12:17.902 --> 12:18.791
You're late!

12:18.792 --> 12:20.569

Mother! Mom!
-Freeze!

12:41.833 --> 12:43.799
Mom! Help!

12:43.833 --> 12:47.532
Gwen! Michael!

12:47.567 --> 12:50.566

12:52.832 --> 12:55.431
Got it?

12:56.232 --> 12:58.364
You what?

13:05.497 --> 13:07.396
What do you want?

13:07.431 --> 13:11.664
What do you want? What you ...

13:11.698 --> 13:14.696
Morning Edition.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.328
Right. Let's leave it

13:27.663 --> 13:30.361
Come, get up!

13:30.395 --> 13:32.394
Talk to me!

13:37.395 --> 13:39.360
Strip.

13:39.394 --> 13:43.393
No. No. .. No!

13:47.661 --> 13:50.660
No.

14:28.057 --> 14:31.056
Look at me, tell the truth!

14:39.856 --> 14:41.821
-Get in!
-Hi. Babies, I'm here.

14:41.856 --> 14:42.642
Mom! Mother! "

14:42.643 --> 14:43.821
-You're right.
"Oh, no.

14:43.856 --> 14:48.387
I have, I have it.

15:02.521 --> 15:05.319
Lord ... sir.

15:05.353 --> 15:07.686
Lord ... I'm sorry, sir,

15:07.720 --> 15:11.019
but it was only the announcement that
could use your cell phone.

15:11.053 --> 15:13.019
The seat belt warning
Security remains connected.

15:13.053 --> 15:15.019
Is it? Sorry.

15:15.053 --> 15:17.218
No problem.

15:17.252 --> 15:18.384
Lord?

15:18.419 --> 15:21.785
-Jennifer, right?
-I need to sit down, sir.

15:21.818 --> 15:24.284
I need to show you something.

15:24.318 --> 15:26.151
Oh, my God.

15:26.185 --> 15:27.851
What the hell is that?

15:27.885 --> 15:30.651
My agents called me.
The pilot's family was kidnapped.

15:30.685 --> 15:34.716
You need to go get it and
bring it back to talk to me.

15:34.751 --> 15:37.950
"Who are you?
-I'm just an analyst with the FBI, right?

15:37.984 --> 15:43.683
They knew I was on vacation, they know
I'm on that flight. So I contacted.

15:43.717 --> 15:49.715
So, if you can get him and bring him
back, I'll be here, right?

16:14.080 --> 16:16.079
Hey, princess.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.278
It's Jen. She is alone?

16:30.312 --> 16:33.111
-I think so.
"She can bring us champagne?

16:33.146 --> 16:37.377
You're a figure ...
Have you worked?

16:46.411 --> 16:51.376
Joe has ... has something very
important that I need to show you.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.976
Sure, Nate. Go ahead
unlock the door, let it go.

16:54.011 --> 16:56.010
Yes, sir.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.708
Sit.

17:16.508 --> 17:18.607
And tadpoles as well.

17:18.642 --> 17:21.873
As you can see today's newspaper.

17:26.674 --> 17:32.205
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.167
First, to cooperate ...

17:35.168 --> 17:38.338
nobody will get hurt.

17:38.372 --> 17:42.971
<i> Secondly, we are all
heavily armed, and you do not. </ i></i>

17:43.006 --> 17:47.171
Without heroes, and nobody dies.

17:47.205 --> 17:49.170
Then just sit ...

17:49.204 --> 17:53.604
enjoy complimentary peanuts,
and not annoy my brothers.

17:53.639 --> 17:58.037
Thirdly ... are not
terrorists, this is not a jihad.

17:58.071 --> 18:02.369
Our demands are very simple, all
want to go home late at night.

18:02.404 --> 18:07.502
<i> So be good sheep, do
I say, and nobody dies. </ i></i>

18:08.637 --> 18:13.702
My brothers will come from the booth
to collect their phones.

18:13.737 --> 18:19.101
<i> Remember, your cooperation
guarantees that no one gets hurt. </ i></i>

18:20.468 --> 18:22.434
That <i> ...</ i></i>

18:22.468 --> 18:25.834
Submit only the
nice men and women.

18:30.902 --> 18:35.600
And finally, for
security guard ...

18:35.635 --> 18:41.633
No heroes, and nobody will
die. Remember that.
196th
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:01,831
<i> Coast 8-5-Heavy,
what is the emergency? </ i></i>

19:03.899 --> 19:07.397
<i> Coast 8-5-Heavy,
what is the emergency? </ i></i>

19:07.698 --> 19:10.196
He has a gun
pointed at his face.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.996
Now ... open the door.

19:34.229 --> 19:36.728
Então é a sua filha.

19:38.194 --> 19:43.860
Wait a minute! Right?
Wait a little, slowly.

19:43.895 --> 19:48.894
Pane ... bassline,
central section has a blue button.

19:50.628 --> 19:52.627
Good boy.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.957
Come on. Come on.

20:14.992 --> 20:19.090
Hello. Hello? Forget
Static bad on the phone.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.624
Here is the Agent
Special Gina Vitale.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.123
I'm in the middle of a
emergency.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.489
-Mrs. President.
-Good morning, Ms. President.

20:33.524 --> 20:37.288
Thank you. Please
okay, someone begins.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.355
Who's down?

20:39.389 --> 20:41.588
Nathan Polansky. He
is one of the browsers.

20:41.623 --> 20:43.588
They shot him.

20:43.623 --> 20:45.921
And who the hell are "they"?

20:45.955 --> 20:47.504
Our guess, of Aryan Brotherhood.

20:47.505 --> 20:50.004
The guy in the cockpit or
has a mole on the eye

20:50.005 --> 20:52.154
or tattoo a teardrop-shaped.

20:52.187 --> 20:55.687
-Does Joe know about Annette?
-He knows, Frank ... He already knows.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.921
How?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.361
The guy in the booth
Joe gave a cell phone.

20:58.362 --> 21:00.520
He spoke with one of
Our staff on site.

21:00.554 --> 21:02.175
DeToro, contact the Starquest.

21:02.176 --> 21:05.419
I have to talk to Joe before
making any decisions.

21:05.453 --> 21:07.119
Yes, Mrs. President.

21:07.153 --> 21:11.152
What is the nearest airport that
they could land, military or civilian?

21:11.186 --> 21:13.919
Well, probably are
on the South Carolina now.

21:13.953 --> 21:16.752
There are six airports
main, and not know, thirty,

21:16.753 --> 21:18.619
forty airports
aviation in general.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.351
We have five bases
Air Force in South Carolina

21:21.386 --> 21:24.417
But only two commercially
behave the Starquest.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.484
-And the military?
-We are well.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.083
What? Well, get it.

21:29.118 --> 21:32.483
We have a Secret Service agent
assigned to his brother.

21:32.518 --> 21:34.752
Sure, Agent Vitale.
You're on speaker

21:34.753 --> 21:36.783
with the president.
What can you tell us?

21:36.818 --> 21:40.682
Has at least ten of them
board. They are all armed.

21:40.717 --> 21:44.050
They have control of
plane. They had been shot

21:44.051 --> 21:47.516
fired, but it seems
the plane was not affected.

21:47.550 --> 21:49.582
-Are you in a safe place?
"Yes, yes.

21:49.617 --> 21:51.616
I did this by compartments
below the plane.

21:51.650 --> 21:54.398
Vitale're saying
can walk freely around?

21:54.399 --> 21:55.315
Yes, ma'am.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.115
Let's take the forms
Complete aircraft.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.947
Okay, so Vitale, the
know about electronics?

21:59.982 --> 22:01.981
<i>'ll learn much more about that. </ i></i>

22:02.015 --> 22:04.514
Sure, it might be useful.

22:09.048 --> 22:13.046
His complete obedience
avoid any victim today.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.745
Madam, the companions
arrived, and we have contact.

22:28.779 --> 22:30.078
I'll put them on speaker.

22:30.112 --> 22:33.244
Bravo, Tango-one, you're in
speaker and speaking with the boss.

22:33.278 --> 22:35.811
Our call sign
will be Bravo-Tango-6.

22:35.845 --> 22:37.811
<i> Roger, Six.
In waiting. </ I></i>

22:37.845 --> 22:40.176
Bravo-Tango-1
Here is President Franklin.

22:40.211 --> 22:43.010
Tell me what you see and what it means.

22:43.044 --> 22:46.076
The plane seems to still be piloted
by a competent crew.

22:46.111 --> 22:50.110
I do not see any evidence of
mechanical problems with the aircraft.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.642
I want you to put your
sister on the line for me.

22:59.676 --> 23:04.675
Think it is easy to catch
e. .. the phone?

23:08.709 --> 23:11.241
ATC, here is the Coasteira
8-5-Heavy.

23:11.275 --> 23:14.574
Could open a channel
to the White House,

23:14.609 --> 23:16.840
so that we could
communicate to Ms. President?

23:17.675 --> 23:20.273
Mrs. President, here is the Starquest.

23:20.308 --> 23:23.974
Mrs. President, is really an honor.

23:24.008 --> 23:26.807
Let me talk to Joe.
I want to hear his voice.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.172
Here is Captain Joe Franklin
Mrs. President.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.906
Do whatever is necessary.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.472
Very noble.

23:32.507 --> 23:34.939
Sure, you have my
attention. Whatever?

23:34.974 --> 23:38.572
Ten of my Aryan Brothers are arrested
stupid government charges

23:38.607 --> 23:41.571
a federal penitentiary
the state of New Jersey.

23:41.606 --> 23:44.337
I want his release
immediately and unconditionally.

23:44.372 --> 23:45.437
Names?

23:45.472 --> 23:47.904
Ask the Director.

23:47.938 --> 23:51.804
Know that our policy is
not negotiate with terrorists.

23:51.838 --> 23:54.570
Yes, I knew it would be a game.

23:54.605 --> 23:56.904
But Joe here, and his family,

23:56.938 --> 24:01.470
have been generous enough in
give me an insurance policy.

24:01.505 --> 24:03.103
I see.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.136
Know what I want.

24:13.769 --> 24:15.768
Empty fuel.

24:19.536 --> 24:21.535
Okay, okay.

24:37.634 --> 24:40.867
6, here is one. The Starquest is
draining fuel.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.063
6, this is Bravo-Tango-2.
Just lost

24:49.064 --> 24:51.565
Bravo-Tango-3 for the emptying
fuel.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.331
6, here are two. She is going
to a population center.

25:03.098 --> 25:04.964
The pilot came out?

25:04.998 --> 25:08.497
Sorry, ma'am. We have
visuals on a ramp.

25:10.865 --> 25:12.830
Vitale, go pro side panel.

25:12.865 --> 25:14.829
Yes.

25:14.864 --> 25:17.896
We need you to replace
manually dump fuel.

25:17.930 --> 25:19.896
I am here ... what
I'm looking for?

25:19.930 --> 25:22.840
Find something that says "Dump
fuel emergency "

25:22.841 --> 25:24.295
"Release of fuel,"
something.

25:24.329 --> 25:26.895
Looks like a Christmas tree.
The whole thing lit up.

25:26.929 --> 25:29.628
I do not ... wait.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.628
Wait a minute.

25:31.662 --> 25:33.628
What about "release
fuel emergency "?

25:33.662 --> 25:35.427
Probably it is.

25:35.462 --> 25:39.660
Listen. Need to press
this button and hold it.
299th
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:43,926
Ready.

25:43.927 --> 25:46.382
The agent stopped Vitale
emptying of fuel.

25:49.994 --> 25:51.960
The fuel is not draining.
He stopped being emptied.

25:51.994 --> 25:55.826
"I did not tell him to stop.
"I did not quit, never stopped!

25:55.861 --> 25:57.826
Is not responding.

26:01.526 --> 26:04.525
I think all this will
let us expel it.

26:12.909 --> 26:18.591
Mrs. President ... we have only
90 minutes of fuel.

26:18.625 --> 26:21.123
You know what to do.

26:26.657 --> 26:28.514
How long before
accordance with clear images

26:28.515 --> 26:30.456
enough to pass
by the NCIC and CODIS?

26:30.491 --> 26:32.956
I have a clue about Karl Hitler.

26:32.990 --> 26:35.555
Have nothing. If I had changed
legally in prison

26:35.590 --> 26:38.321
five years would be a penalty
ten years for bank robbery.

26:38.356 --> 26:40.921
An armed bank robbery to help
finance the Aryan Brotherhood.

26:40.956 --> 26:43.555
Arians? Great.
Heavily armed psychopaths.

26:43.590 --> 26:44.855
He checked the address it here?

26:44.856 --> 26:47.387
The parole agent
said it is up to date.

26:47.421 --> 26:49.721
We will make sure
he is still there.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.403
Tell Terry to mount a
mobile team in five minutes,

26:51.404 --> 26:53.087
and talk to bring
plenty of ammunition.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.985
So it was great.
They came running ...

27:14.587 --> 27:17.251
Take him out.
Now look, Snake.

27:17.286 --> 27:19.251
Mother! "

27:19.286 --> 27:23.017
Honey.
Here, here, look at me.

27:25.486 --> 27:29.484
Right.
So, good job.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.882
Hey, hear that?

27:52.516 --> 27:55.047
Where do you think is going?

27:55.082 --> 27:58.314
-See our guests ..?
No, it will not.
327th
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,348
Sit.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.018
Run as fast as possible on the road.
Get help to us, right?

28:10.348 --> 28:12.347
Harry?
330th
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:15,613
Why me?

28:17.947 --> 28:21.946
How about "because I told you so"?

28:23.446 --> 28:25.445
Come on!

28:33.145 --> 28:35.911
-Damn!
-Mommy, Mommy!

28:45.011 --> 28:47.010
Damn!

28:48.410 --> 28:50.409
Because I had to do this?

28:50.444 --> 28:52.409
Do not worry, Snake.
Let's get them.

28:52.444 --> 28:54.409
-No!
Drop-it, bitch!

28:54.444 --> 28:58.442
-Stop it!
-If you move, you will die.

29:53.104 --> 29:55.604
Okay, go with Dad.
Come on!

30:01.303 --> 30:03.302
Hey, kid!

30:05.303 --> 30:07.802
I'm your sister!

30:13.770 --> 30:19.801
Now that I have your attention,
let me tell you something.

30:19.836 --> 30:23.267
And believe me,
I'm talking about pretty serious.

30:23.301 --> 30:28.067
Next time ...
will be in her head.

30:30.234 --> 30:36.800
Sure, you have five seconds
get back here, or already was!

30:36.835 --> 30:38.833
A!

30:40.967 --> 30:42.966
Two!

30:45.567 --> 30:47.566
Three!

30:49.899 --> 30:52.898
Do not!

30:54.432 --> 30:57.065
Get him!

31:03.499 --> 31:05.764
"You okay?
-I want to go home!

31:05.798 --> 31:07.797
Here.

31:07.898 --> 31:09.797
Move over, kids!

31:18.464 --> 31:22.195
Bravo-Tango-1
stay far away and firm.

31:22.229 --> 31:26.228
In the current trajectory, how long will
before they fly over the Atlantic,

31:26.263 --> 31:28.595
know, far from the populated areas?

31:28.629 --> 31:30.628
About twenty minutes.

31:32.329 --> 31:38.761
Well, if the plane is on autopilot,
we can not assume it, get it back?

31:38.795 --> 31:42.393
We can not attempt to override
the whole pattern of his flight?

31:42.428 --> 31:46.226
Well, it's self.
There is no signal to be blocked.

31:46.261 --> 31:48.712
There is another option.
We are working on

31:48.713 --> 31:51.392
an emergency system
named "Kitty Hawk"

31:51.427 --> 31:55.692
it allows us to take control
in flight and redirect it.

31:55.726 --> 31:57.450
To be more specific,
is an unfolding

31:57.451 --> 31:59.292
the vehicle program
unmanned aerial.

31:59.327 --> 32:02.216
We are doing some testing
Preliminary adaptation

32:02.217 --> 32:05.058
this technology for use in
civil aircraft compromised.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.791
Right then, as
time for the satellite?

32:07.826 --> 32:10.825
We are now working on it.
Ten, fifteen minutes?

32:17.291 --> 32:21.723
Hey, Willie, already found
that security?

32:21.758 --> 32:23.924
I'm still looking.

32:23.958 --> 32:27.189
Well .. start to shoot people

32:27.223 --> 32:30.222
until that bastard appear.

32:39.823 --> 32:43.287
You! You're the security officer?

32:43.322 --> 32:46.187
"You look like a porthole. You is it?
-No.

32:46.221 --> 32:48.187
Hell, you're so ...

32:50.221 --> 32:53.954
Shut up! Shut up!
378th
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:58,286
Hey, Willie, now what?
Was he safe?

32:58.321 --> 33:03.386
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

33:03.420 --> 33:06.419
-What?
-Hey!

33:08.487 --> 33:10.519
Want to help me here?

33:10.554 --> 33:12.618
I do not know where he is.

33:12.653 --> 33:15.919
You do not need it.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.217
Where does this go?
Where will this lead?

33:18.252 --> 33:21.552
I. .. downstairs.
Cargo compartment.

33:21.586 --> 33:23.584
C'mon.

33:33.918 --> 33:37.650
I know that is where the agent
Security is hiding.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.049
I'm feeling.

33:42.083 --> 33:45.282
What do you ..?!

33:45.317 --> 33:50.248
Okay, dear.

34:11.714 --> 34:13.012
We have a problem.

34:13.047 --> 34:16.045
We lost the autopilot.

34:19.780 --> 34:22.779
They're obviously taking
difficulty controlling the aircraft.

34:25.112 --> 34:26.911
And we can not
take control?

34:26.946 --> 34:28.945
Not yet.

34:29.279 --> 34:32.911
We'll have to leave Joe
do your job.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.911
Joe?

34:34.945 --> 34:38.344
The man up there, Bill.
I have total confidence in Joe.

34:38.378 --> 34:40.377
Okay, let's go.

34:53.043 --> 34:55.043
Come on!

35:20.107 --> 35:23.873
We will get well soon
near those buildings.

35:29.240 --> 35:34.372
Come on, Billy, get it!

35:34.406 --> 35:37.906
-I can not handle it!
"Come on, Billy! Raise it!

36:12.437 --> 36:14.935
It's happening again!

36:24.101 --> 36:27.600
I think the rotating stabilizers
are functioning again.

36:30.301 --> 36:33.033
This autopilot broke down.

36:33.034 --> 36:36.500
I do not think we'll retrieve it.

36:36.535 --> 36:39.066
Do not worry about the pilot
Automatic. You got me here.

36:39.100 --> 36:42.833
While on board, I am
the control of the aircraft, right?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.766
What happened to the pilot
automatic, gentlemen?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.799
I do not know.

37:01.799 --> 37:03.798
Give me a hand.

37:07.565 --> 37:09.330
You're the security officer?

37:09.364 --> 37:11.363
No.

37:11.464 --> 37:13.996
A cop?

37:14.031 --> 37:16.496
Who are you?

37:16.531 --> 37:19.563
Only the right person at
wrong place at the wrong time.

37:19.597 --> 37:24.529
That's it.
Are you okay?

37:24.563 --> 37:26.562
No.

37:26.596 --> 37:30.094
Just ... hold on tight.

37:31.729 --> 37:33.728
Buster!

37:41.228 --> 37:44.227
-Idiot!
-No!

37:57.519 --> 37:58.859
Stop, stop!
424th
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,725
Damn!

38:04.759 --> 38:08.758
-Robert will kill you ...
-Shut up!

38:10.258 --> 38:12.224
Willie is dead, man.

38:12.258 --> 38:15.224
Really?

38:15.258 --> 38:19.424
That should be simple and enjoyable
As Robert said!

38:19.458 --> 38:22.089
Yes, well, not Robert
is simple and enjoyable.

39:20.519 --> 39:24.484
Is she?
Who killed Willie?

39:24.519 --> 39:27.250
Yes, of course it is.
432nd
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:33,250
Cursed Willie. Leaving
be killed by a whore.

39:33.284 --> 39:38.517
Come on. Let's say that Robert
found the security guard.

39:38.551 --> 39:41.549
I do not ...
Tell you.

39:56.382 --> 40:00.381
Here is the special agent
Vitale, 2-9-4-8-3.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.847
Yes, I'm still in season.

40:02.882 --> 40:05.792
You can put me on hold,
but keep writing

40:05.793 --> 40:08.346
and I will continue talking
in ... Thank you.

40:08.381 --> 40:11.691
One of the kidnappers
is dead. I am using

40:11.692 --> 40:15.213
his phone ... Perhaps
can get a signal.

40:15.247 --> 40:18.813
You know what ... 'll
send his number.

40:18.847 --> 40:20.579
Maybe you could get an address.

40:20.614 --> 40:22.678
But ... Hello?
Yes!

40:22.713 --> 40:26.178
Agent Vitale, is in
back in with the president.

40:26.213 --> 40:28.512
Agent Vitale, what's the latest?

40:28.546 --> 40:33.044
<i> Some passengers were killed.
From their side, there is a low. </ I></i>

40:33.078 --> 40:37.343
<i> confirm my original estimate
ten hijackers. </ i></i>

40:37.378 --> 40:39.477
Can contact
with the security guard?

40:41.512 --> 40:43.577
Agent Vitale?

40:43.612 --> 40:46.076
God.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.736
The governor of Carolina
South wants to activate

40:47.737 --> 40:49.176
units of
Air National Guard

40:49.211 --> 40:53.242
with orders to shoot down the plane,
cross the airspace of its cities.

40:53.277 --> 40:55.309
-And the idiot wants to be president.
-Yes.

40:55.343 --> 40:58.142
If the order to shoot
is a given, it will come to me.

40:58.176 --> 41:00.742
-Let this clear.
"I will tell you.

41:00.777 --> 41:04.141
We learned that his brother
has control of the aircraft.

41:04.175 --> 41:08.409
Mrs. President, we confirm
ten Aryan Brotherhood in Fairton.

41:08.442 --> 41:09.775
Why are they in prison?

41:09.809 --> 41:13.340
They fired for about an arsenal
five, trying to get some weapons.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.508
We lost three ATF agents.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.307
How are we with the satellite?

41:19.341 --> 41:21.466
We have an uplink to
alive, but the integrity

41:21.467 --> 41:23.640
data with
ailerons was compromised.

41:23.674 --> 41:25.172
Committed to?

41:25.207 --> 41:26.697
There is a flaw in
somewhere in the system

41:26.698 --> 41:28.339
causing
communication problems

41:28.374 --> 41:32.238
between the cockpit and the servants who
are controlling the ailerons.

41:32.273 --> 41:36.539
If the failures continue, I fear that
we may lose control of the aircraft.

41:36.573 --> 41:38.406
We have a connection with the Starquest.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.905
Okay, turn it on.

41:42.939 --> 41:46.405
Mrs. President ... How are
my brothers Aryans?

41:46.439 --> 41:49.137
We are talking to
director. How are you, Joe?

41:49.171 --> 41:53.170
I'm fine, Mrs. President. So
as in Ice Fishing Point George.
475th
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:59,236
We are isolating the ten brothers.

41:59.271 --> 42:02.370
Isolating or releasing <i> </ i></i>

42:02.405 --> 42:05.003
For now, we are isolating them.
478th
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:07,035
Isolating ...

42:10.003 --> 42:12.502
This is what the isolation buying ...

42:15.418 --> 42:17.002
But damn!

42:17.036 --> 42:19.834
So you're thinking of
play in the water below?

42:19.869 --> 42:24.534
Bill will redirect this flight for us
lead to all East Coast cities.

42:24.568 --> 42:29.834
If we play down and rains will
debris throughout the east coast.

42:31.402 --> 42:34.200
Bill, make a new plan
flight for me, could you?

42:34.234 --> 42:36.233
Now!

42:41.768 --> 42:44.266
Do not mess with me.

42:51.932 --> 42:53.898
What is our next step?

42:53.932 --> 42:56.731
Okay, let's go get something to
to focus on Point George.

42:56.766 --> 42:58.731
Why is that?

42:58.766 --> 43:02.063
Because they never ice fished Point
George. So something is happening there.

43:02.098 --> 43:04.097
We're with him.

43:20.497 --> 43:25.562
Lord, that combines with a truck
image we have a camera of a bank

43:25.597 --> 43:29.028
in the area where the kidnappers
the van disappeared.

43:29.062 --> 43:32.361
And they are stationed in
front of the house of Karl Hitler.

43:32.396 --> 43:34.461
What a surprise.

43:34.496 --> 43:39.160
The best approach is to use the bank
and then take the truck to cover.

43:39.195 --> 43:41.160
That still leaves the
front windows.

43:41.195 --> 43:44.226
Collins, you will monitor and
warn you if see any movement.

43:44.261 --> 43:47.494
Let's break down doors and shoot them
before they can react.

43:47.528 --> 43:51.026
Today, nobody dies
only the bad, right?

43:52.861 --> 43:54.860
Taken control of the airplane.

43:54.894 --> 43:56.851
Although the statute of
passenger safety

43:56.852 --> 43:58.892
is unknown, there
various speculations for ...

44:00.326 --> 44:03.324
First team to go and
be in a position now.

44:11.558 --> 44:13.524
You will not end?

44:13.558 --> 44:16.223
Damn it, man. Damn day long.

44:21.057 --> 44:24.056
Mrs. President, the satellite has
and a lock is loading.
508th
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:27,656
How long will it take?
-Five minutes.

44:27.691 --> 44:29.955
Well, let's go. Where,
what is the closest runway?

44:29.990 --> 44:31.955
Charleston. We
take them to Charleston.

44:31.990 --> 44:33.955
No.
Merritt is a better choice.

44:33.990 --> 44:35.955
It is a military base, not civilian.

44:35.990 --> 44:38.988
Let's take them Merritt then.
-Do this.

44:43.522 --> 44:47.021
Bill? What is this?

44:47.989 --> 44:50.577
We seem
on fire below.

44:50.578 --> 44:52.820
We'll have to come down
and take a look.

44:52.855 --> 44:54.820
No, nobody will leave.

44:54.855 --> 44:56.820
Whether we burn?

44:56.855 --> 45:00.387
I imagine that a plane so advanced
has some way to deal with fire.

45:00.421 --> 45:04.420
-I should go there to see.
"Nobody is going anywhere!

45:43.216 --> 45:45.782
Mrs. President, Kitty Hawk
ready for your command.

45:45.816 --> 45:48.849
How long will it take to get it?
-Just sort.

45:48.883 --> 45:50.849
Come on.

45:50.883 --> 45:53.324
Here is General Dillard.
We are ready

45:53.325 --> 45:55.881
to take flight.
Again, the bird fly.

46:08.714 --> 46:11.713
Kitty Hawk has a grip
hand with Starquest.

46:21.414 --> 46:23.345
Bill ... are you doing this?

46:23.380 --> 46:25.345
What's happening?

46:25.380 --> 46:28.379
I think the autopilot again.

46:36.211 --> 46:40.943
I'm setting a
vector of 142.3 to 27,000 feet.

46:40.978 --> 46:43.043
Sure, the place still Merritt
docking closer?

46:43.078 --> 46:49.142
It is close now, but I think
we can still do that.

46:49.177 --> 46:53.909
It is as if the plane took control
of itself, except it is erratic.

46:55.510 --> 46:58.009
The flaps are turned down.

47:02.809 --> 47:04.775
At this air speed?

47:04.809 --> 47:07.341
I know, I know. He will rip
wings right out.

47:07.376 --> 47:09.441
But why the hell
is he doing this?

47:09.476 --> 47:11.708
Someone can take the
control of the plane out?

47:11.743 --> 47:15.741
No, not that I know ...
-Robert!

47:19.708 --> 47:22.840
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but it seems that such sudden breakdown

47:22.874 --> 47:26.374
is taking us to the
nearest airport.

47:38.706 --> 47:41.705
Okay, let's go.
Come on, raise it.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.738
Something is not right.

47:54.472 --> 47:56.471
She is not responding.

47:57.838 --> 48:00.636
We're going too fast.
We are fighting to hold on to it.

48:00.671 --> 48:03.670
What ... You have control or not?

48:11.970 --> 48:13.969
Telemetry is all wrong.

48:23.802 --> 48:28.267
It is not responding to input,
she is not responding.

48:28.301 --> 48:30.800
It's coming fast
and too low!

48:38.967 --> 48:40.966
Bravo-Tango-6,
here is Bravo-Tango-1.

48:41.067 --> 48:44.432
<i> Starquest going
straight to the city. </ i></i>

48:44.467 --> 48:47.499
Will have to let it go,
Let Joe take it!

48:47.533 --> 48:49.532
Three minutes to landing.

49:01.865 --> 49:03.864
Okay, c'mon, c'mon.
Lift it.

49:03.898 --> 49:05.930
Come on, Billy.
Lift it!

49:05.965 --> 49:08.464
The engines are kicking.

49:11.797 --> 49:13.763
Jesus, the landing gear going down.

49:13.797 --> 49:15.796
Because someone is lowering it.

49:17.731 --> 49:19.995
I recommend abortion, sir.

49:20.564 --> 49:25.962
Here is Bravo-Tango-2. Wings
Starquest are swinging a lot.

49:27.295 --> 49:29.261
Cason, let it go!

49:29.295 --> 49:31.261
Forget it.
That's an order!

49:31.295 --> 49:35.294
Kitty Hawk, here is Cason NSA
you must abort. Again, it should abort!

49:47.294 --> 49:50.326
Climb. Climb it, climb it.

49:50.361 --> 49:51.760
Upload it!

49:51.794 --> 49:54.460
Let's stop!

49:54.494 --> 49:57.025
We will not stop!
Reduce power!

49:57.060 --> 50:00.059
Bring the landing gear
up!

50:01.992 --> 50:03.991
See those buildings?

50:36.223 --> 50:37.422
Come on!

50:37.457 --> 50:42.455
His ... great ... beautiful ... whale!

51:01.321 --> 51:06.319
This is Bravo-Tango-2. The Starquest
is flying straight and level.

51:13.453 --> 51:15.652
Mrs. President,
knows better than that.

51:15.686 --> 51:18.166
I know I tried to take
control of this

51:18.167 --> 51:21.017
plan somehow
and this will cost you.

51:21.052 --> 51:23.017
DJ, open the door.

51:23.052 --> 51:25.051
Is up.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.347
What the hell was that?!

52:12.381 --> 52:15.480
Find the security officer.

52:15.514 --> 52:18.012
Any other agent
safety, stand up.

52:23.946 --> 52:27.446
How about three of us give a ride?

52:34.011 --> 52:36.594
Mrs. President,
Secret Service reports that

52:36.595 --> 52:39.177
the first lady and her
children are in shelter.

52:39.212 --> 52:42.677
Her mother is safe. Locate
his sister. She is out of the country.

52:42.712 --> 52:44.677
Thank you.

52:44.712 --> 52:46.710
Take that.

53:05.509 --> 53:08.741
Still no sign of
movement in the window.

53:08.775 --> 53:11.308
Helicopters in position
and waiting.

53:11.343 --> 53:14.607
Tell them that they are ready
jumping up and enter.

53:22.841 --> 53:24.840
Come on. Come on, come on!

53:38.640 --> 53:42.372
Come before. Be ready to
come quickly to the smoke.

54:22.536 --> 54:25.034
Come on! Come on!

54:34.967 --> 54:37.800
Do not let them use
the hostages as shields.

54:44.325 --> 54:45.666
That, my ass is that
bulletproof, bitch!
595th
00:54:57,299 --> 00:54:59,298
Clean!

54:59.799 --> 55:02.297
Clean! We have a runner!

55:05.465 --> 55:08.397
I thought I heard something funny.

55:08.432 --> 55:10.396
Let me see your hands.

55:10.431 --> 55:13.896
That was me. I
to go to the bathroom.

55:13.931 --> 55:15.929
Ruth!

55:30.430 --> 55:33.728
Sarco-1, the suspect is fleeing
a white cargo van.

55:33.762 --> 55:36.761
Go ahead and keep eye contact.

55:41.795 --> 55:43.794
Come on!

55:51.660 --> 55:53.659
Damn! Damn!

56:14.658 --> 56:16.791
Do not shoot! I repeat, do not shoot.

56:16.825 --> 56:18.624
We need the target alive.

56:18.658 --> 56:20.540
Lord, and if he
say where hostages are

56:20.541 --> 56:22.557
and tell them to be
move, or shoot them?

56:22.591 --> 56:25.623
Can you bring the target to a
quick stop without killing it?

56:25.657 --> 56:27.656
<i> Affirmative. </ i></i>

56:36.656 --> 56:38.655
Dammit!

56:40.088 --> 56:42.087
Damn!

56:48.422 --> 56:50.487
Oh no, not you.

56:53.019 --> 56:53.886
It, bring it!

57:08.020 --> 57:10.019
Damn!

57:22.019 --> 57:27.551
You know ... you and my ex-wife
have similar qualities.

57:27.585 --> 57:31.583
Perhaps when all this is done,
We can get a little bit?

57:33.818 --> 57:36.816
"I do not have it.
-Claro.

57:47.750 --> 57:51.748
You have two choices.
Can open the folder or ...

57:54.416 --> 57:56.381
What's your choice?

57:56.416 --> 58:00.348
Here! Take it, right?
Take it!

58:05.581 --> 58:07.580
This poses a problem.

58:20.079 --> 58:23.446
What we are doing
about it, Robert?

58:23.480 --> 58:27.978
It is part of a plan that you have not had
privilege of knowing yet, Ralph.

58:32.912 --> 58:35.144
Make sure that
I'm not bothered.

58:45.811 --> 58:50.376
I said, I do not have the key!
The guy on the other side has the key!

58:50.411 --> 58:53.410
This may hurt a little.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.075
Damn!

59:30.440 --> 59:32.439
Bastard!

01:00:04.337 --> 01:00:06.603
Yes, sir, I will return.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.902
The guys toast.
Were burned in the disaster.

01:00:08.936 --> 01:00:10.902
Great.
Some good news?

01:00:10.936 --> 01:00:12.935
I took it from his pocket
one of the boys.

01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:16.393
We can get some
SIM card information.

01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:17.535
I have the record.

01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:19.702
-Where?
Point-George.

01:00:19.735 --> 01:00:21.734
Okay, let's go.

01:00:25.068 --> 01:00:27.734
The SIM card seems
still be legible.

01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:29.768
Let's see ...

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:37.016
It has a text message
posted at 9:30 this morning:

01:00:37.017 --> 01:00:38.533
"Delivery on the way."
642nd
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,799
Locate your destination.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.265
Lord, have another
message text here.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.265
Sent soon after his fall.
Only says: "Problem."

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.299
Okay, let's hurry.
We are running out of time.

01:00:57.399 --> 01:01:01.930
Your current position leads to Alexandria
Virginia, directly to DC.

01:01:01.964 --> 01:01:07.463
If I had to bring down the plane,
where would be the best place?

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.863
Find a safe place
Mrs. President.

01:01:09.898 --> 01:01:11.863
We have the Phoenix System.

01:01:11.897 --> 01:01:15.229
-What is it?
Laser-launched satellite.

01:01:15.264 --> 01:01:19.962
This is a five-megawatt laser spatial
which vaporizes the metal contact.

01:01:19.997 --> 01:01:24.762
Can focus on a target with precision
less than a foot in diameter.

01:01:24.796 --> 01:01:28.895
We had almost 90% successful
reduction targets.

01:01:28.929 --> 01:01:31.073
The laser detonates the
fuel in the wings,

01:01:31.074 --> 01:01:35.361
virtually disintegrating the
plane, leaving few traces.

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:41.127
If you do, I do it in an area
uninhabited, so think of these areas.

01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:42.761
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:42.795 --> 01:01:47.593
Well, let's start organizing
the National Guard,

01:01:47.627 --> 01:01:50.226
hospitals and service
Search and Rescue.

01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:52.259
Yes, Mrs. President.

01:02:03.159 --> 01:02:07.191
I have already said the key.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:09.317
-Stay with me.
-I do not have the key.

01:02:09.318 --> 01:02:11.024
-Stay with me.
-I have not.

01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:13.457
You can survive it.

01:02:13.492 --> 01:02:17.743
Marsha ... Marsha.
What are you doing?
666th
01:02:18,163 --> 01:02:19,560
What are you doing?

01:02:21.891 --> 01:02:24.890
Hey!
Stay with me.

01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:26.922
Okay, okay.

01:03:01.554 --> 01:03:02.528
She's back.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:05.452
Vitale agent, you are
back to President Franklin.

01:03:05.487 --> 01:03:07.452
It's the money!

01:03:07.487 --> 01:03:09.552
How well "the money"?

01:03:09.587 --> 01:03:13.218
Securities, worth of bonds.

01:03:13.253 --> 01:03:17.351
Vitale, we have no control
aircraft. I may have to bring him down.

01:03:17.386 --> 01:03:21.251
Give me more time, Mrs. President. I will
try to take him down from here.

01:03:21.286 --> 01:03:24.185
-Do not have much time.
-I know.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:27.251
Drugs.

01:03:27.286 --> 01:03:32.216
Mrs. President, this is a list of
SAT for special circumstances.

01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:37.116
His agent Vitale is on board,
security officer

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:39.549
but so are two messengers.

01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:42.383
Let me guess ...
are moving cash.

01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:46.417
One hundred and fifty million
dollars in bonds.

01:03:52.442 --> 01:03:56.913
TJ, I want you to know
policies of the rich.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.138
Of course I want to download and 100 of those.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:04.120
-What is going chief?
-Forget it, do what I say.

01:04:16.299 --> 01:04:18.278
What are you doing
out of place?

01:04:22.739 --> 01:04:25.765
"Who are you?
-I am a passenger.

01:04:44.327 --> 01:04:46.340
It is you who is causing
all these problems?

01:04:52.101 --> 01:04:53.875
Secret Service.

01:04:56.206 --> 01:05:01.326
It's the nanny's sister's president,
that pretty.

01:05:01.444 --> 01:05:04.242
But it will be with
the family when you die.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:07.831
But I found
trunk of the family.

01:05:08.618 --> 01:05:14.147
"You know where my suitcase is.
"I know and you do not.

01:05:25.902 --> 01:05:28.974
You're just a bank robber.
It's just the money.

01:05:29.505 --> 01:05:31.234
It's a lot of money.

01:05:33.643 --> 01:05:34.951
Damn ...

01:06:29.499 --> 01:06:31.182
And you were already dead.

01:06:41.844 --> 01:06:43.562
You must be kidding.

01:06:48.985 --> 01:06:51.317
Robert, what's the plan?

01:06:53.056 --> 01:06:55.570
Wait, leave here in a minute.

01:08:05.094 --> 01:08:07.745
Stay away from the door, princess.

01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:39.618
ENGINE DAMAGED

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:41.839
Just lost
engine power.

01:08:42.098 --> 01:08:43.337
Really?

01:08:44.567 --> 01:08:46.319
We could not have lost the engine.

01:08:55.978 --> 01:08:58.026
If not we land
now we will fall.

01:09:00.249 --> 01:09:02.433
-Do it!
-Hold on, hold on.

01:09:05.755 --> 01:09:08.212
6, this is Bravo Tango 2.

01:09:09.591 --> 01:09:13.598
The charge exploded and it seems
the motor was with her.

01:09:16.732 --> 01:09:19.064
See any further damage,
something more superficial?

01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:22.876
Negative, try to get close to
see the damage, but walk quickly.

01:09:23.272 --> 01:09:26.992
I guess I can not continue
flying more.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:29.725
Tango Bravo 2 if it was
pilot could fly this plane?

01:09:30.011 --> 01:09:31.718
I did not want.

01:09:33.282 --> 01:09:35.523
Okay, let me be
clear. If you shoot,
The 716th
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:39,231
I do not think that it is in
the air for long.

01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:43.863
Mrs. President, reached an information
the next 60 seconds.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:46.068
Were seen six miles.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.381
Lady?

01:09:52.202 --> 01:09:57.139
We can use this fire to
bring them to a controlled area?

01:10:01.211 --> 01:10:04.715
Mrs. President, this aircraft
was equipped with guard
722nd
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:06,567
and a missile defense system.

01:10:06.783 --> 01:10:09.058
What is the chance he
keep giving it the shape?

01:10:09.486 --> 01:10:11.295
Currently unknown.

01:10:22.031 --> 01:10:28.971
Bravo-Tango-two, here is Franklin,
is authorized to bring the plane down.

01:10:31.207 --> 01:10:32.731
Roger, Bravo-Tango-6.

01:10:46.356 --> 01:10:47.698
Zorro-3, Zorro-3.

01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:53.026
Locked-defense system.
-What was that?

01:11:00.737 --> 01:11:02.944
June 2 is here, the missiles
were eliminated.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.973
Firing again.

01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:11.318
The missile is moving.

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.299
What happened?

01:11:20.023 --> 01:11:22.173
Bravo-Tango-two, has to abort
the mission immediately.

01:11:22.825 --> 01:11:24.395
Understood in June, mission aborted.

01:11:25.995 --> 01:11:26.814
They have a laser?

01:11:29.499 --> 01:11:32.104
-How far are?
-They are coming.

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:35.235
Get me the White House.

01:11:37.207 --> 01:11:38.310
Yes, Madam.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.741
We gotta go.
Come on.

01:12:00.663 --> 01:12:02.824
Come on, come on.

01:12:08.805 --> 01:12:10.727
President, we
waiting for their orders.

01:12:11.207 --> 01:12:12.253
Proceed.

01:12:23.519 --> 01:12:25.157
Pro floor to the ground!

01:12:34.297 --> 01:12:35.787
Do not mess ...

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:45.291
We are not stabilized,
're falling.
746th
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,920
6, here is 2, Bravo-Tango-1
just explode.

01:13:02.558 --> 01:13:04.492
The laser-worked.
-Are you listening?

01:13:04.761 --> 01:13:06.752
"No pro airplane.
-What happened?

01:13:06.963 --> 01:13:09.784
-What happened?
Tango-Bravo 2, continue.

01:13:11.834 --> 01:13:13.165
Shot him.

01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:22.682
-Turn off it, unplug it!
Turn off-the laser.

01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:41.986
She can not die.

01:13:42.932 --> 01:13:46.424
There is nothing to descend.
Fly without the engine.

01:13:47.937 --> 01:13:50.826
-Damn!
-Over, okay?

01:13:51.941 --> 01:13:54.546
Let me get off the plane to which
these people do not have to die.

01:13:54.811 --> 01:13:57.917
-Let me think.
-Does not have to think about anything.

01:13:58.281 --> 01:14:00.727
It takes just 5 minutes to land
and nobody will give a hero.

01:14:03.886 --> 01:14:06.719
Guys, we ran out of time.

01:14:06.923 --> 01:14:08.572
Do something, do it!

01:14:12.695 --> 01:14:14.526
What's the plan?

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:19.357
-I will talk with my brother.
-All right.

01:14:26.676 --> 01:14:32.148
-Me, Joe.
-I am a little busy now.

01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:34.482
Do not want to be thick but
can go straight to the point,

01:14:34.684 --> 01:14:35.787
I appreciate it.

01:14:36.152 --> 01:14:39.041
Remember when we fish the bay?

01:14:40.523 --> 01:14:43.720
-What beautiful memories.
-Thanks.

01:14:47.063 --> 01:14:48.610
See you there.

01:14:51.067 --> 01:14:57.700
This nonsense will not happen
and my brothers will not be released.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.593
All-or hurt themselves.
-Sure, DC will not accept it.

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:04.289
Well, put the table,
we arrived for dinner.

01:15:06.015 --> 01:15:08.722
-Hey, that's my sister.
-Fuck your sister.

01:15:08.851 --> 01:15:12.730
-The search continues ...
-I do not believe they shot the plane.

01:15:12.889 --> 01:15:17.167
-We have reports that ...
"You know what that means.

01:15:31.274 --> 01:15:32.445
Sorry, lady.

01:15:33.276 --> 01:15:35.141
Sorry. I pity you,
soon as we begin to know ourselves.

01:15:43.052 --> 01:15:44.155
Do not move.

01:15:48.057 --> 01:15:50.036
3 hostages got down here
and I'll kill them all!

01:15:55.765 --> 01:15:57.016
FBI, right?

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:11.229
Not the loss, I can not
keep this plane.

01:16:11.848 --> 01:16:13.213
Is dropping.

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:31.745
Can I fly a plane alone.

01:16:37.106 --> 01:16:38.949
Okay?

01:16:43.246 --> 01:16:44.406
I lost GPS.

01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:48.283
-They are very bad?
We flew blind, and nearly out of fuel.

01:16:57.393 --> 01:16:59.714
Mrs. President, the plane is
DC airspace.

01:17:00.263 --> 01:17:03.016
President, I have two
waiting in line.

01:17:03.366 --> 01:17:07.109
-Joe.
'We have control of the airplane again.

01:17:07.336 --> 01:17:11.340
Actually we do not need because we have
map, satellite or anything else.

01:17:11.774 --> 01:17:14.220
But ... we landed in Dallas.

01:17:15.545 --> 01:17:19.345
-Sure, and your family is safe.
Thanks, Harriet.

01:17:22.852 --> 01:17:24.558
We lost communication.

01:17:32.762 --> 01:17:33.911
Are you okay?

01:17:36.532 --> 01:17:41.583
Yes I am better than Ben, lodge
this baby and get back home.

01:17:42.305 --> 01:17:44.671
-How?
The old-fashioned.

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:48.248
Let's take it and plant it on the track.

01:17:48.644 --> 01:17:50.851
Navigate the brands.

01:17:53.049 --> 01:17:55.768
Gina was very kind to me
say what you see there.

01:17:58.487 --> 01:18:01.502
The Lincoln Memorial at 2:00
approximately 3 km.

01:18:03.225 --> 01:18:06.945
The Washington Monument
11.00, five kilometers.

01:18:14.737 --> 01:18:17.444
That, slowly, slowly.

01:18:19.175 --> 01:18:21.200
Let's try the next port.

01:18:27.049 --> 01:18:29.131
We can not give back
these conditions.

01:18:29.719 --> 01:18:32.654
Your browser does not work
levels are not certain.

01:18:32.888 --> 01:18:35.038
Never be able to land this thing,
we can not keep it that way.

01:18:35.124 --> 01:18:37.968
Sure. Gina, I can
give a glass of water.

01:18:38.394 --> 01:18:39.998
By half, please.

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.834
All right, brother?

01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:49.379
We hope so.

01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:54.345
Thank you.

01:18:54.777 --> 01:18:56.142
Capital right, 1:00.

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.379
National Park
left side. 09:00.

01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:11.581
-The wheels are falling.
-You have to give me good news.

01:19:13.562 --> 01:19:16.474
Joe can not land this plane.

01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:19.264
We're running out of fuel.
Never succeed.

01:19:28.611 --> 01:19:32.354
Gina, I think it would be
a good idea to sit down.

01:19:38.287 --> 01:19:42.030
Never succeed.
Between this and the street prostitutes,

01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:45.158
the only thing that keeps me
trying to land this plane.

01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.726
They're going straight to
building capital.

01:24:12.194 --> 01:24:16.028
I was so scared.
Are you okay?

01:24:16.432 --> 01:24:17.774
Yes.

01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:22.801
Hey buddy.

01:24:25.708 --> 01:24:27.896
Do not you ever fly again.
