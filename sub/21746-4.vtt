00:07.666 --> 00:09.000
From the outside,

00:09.083 --> 00:12.041
this might look like
a conventional oil refinery.

00:12.125 --> 00:13.166
But the fact is

00:13.250 --> 00:16.708
that North Stream Oil's newest
facility is one of the greenest

00:16.791 --> 00:20.000
and most efficient industrial
processors in the world.

00:21.041 --> 00:23.291
Using the latest
scientific research

00:23.375 --> 00:25.333
to transform oil sands bitumen

00:25.416 --> 00:27.083
into synthetic crude oil,

00:27.166 --> 00:30.583
our state of the art technology
both increases yield

00:30.666 --> 00:34.958
and captures up to 90% of our
industrial carbon emissions.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.291
Producing more end products
we rely on.

00:38.375 --> 00:41.541
From gasoline, diesel,
jet fuel and propane

00:42.750 --> 00:47.625
to medicines, plastics, paints,
textiles and cosmetics.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.125
Making more of the essential
materials that a clean,

00:52.208 --> 00:54.541
modern society depends on.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.625
Whitey, do you copy...

02:43.083 --> 02:45.666
We cannot judge a biography
by its length,

02:49.041 --> 02:50.875
nor by the number
of pages in it.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.916
We must judge it by the richness
of its contents.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.541
Sometimes those unfinished
are the most poignant.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.125
We cannot judge a song
by its duration,

03:06.041 --> 03:07.250
or by the number of its notes.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.708
We must judge it

03:12.583 --> 03:14.916
by how it touches
and lifts our souls.

03:20.541 --> 03:22.291
Sometimes those unfinished

03:23.708 --> 03:24.875
are the most beautiful.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.333
And when something has
enriched our lives,

03:36.541 --> 03:39.333
and its melody lingers
in our hearts,

03:42.083 --> 03:43.416
is it unfinished?

03:47.416 --> 03:48.875
Or is it endless?

04:24.291 --> 04:26.291
Seems so quiet all of a sudden.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.833
Fucking toys everywhere.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.291
What?

04:42.500 --> 04:43.833
His toys everywhere.

04:46.541 --> 04:47.791
Don't you dare tidy up.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.416
I wasn't gonna.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Nobody's going to tidy
our little boy away.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.333
If you want to tidy up,

05:00.416 --> 05:01.892
go inside and get rid
of some of those flowers.

05:01.916 --> 05:04.041
I can't breathe in there
for the stink of the lilies.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.416
Fucking ducked.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.250
You know?

05:19.708 --> 05:20.541
What?

05:20.625 --> 05:21.625
I ducked.

05:24.916 --> 05:27.208
Didn't mean to. I was...
Fucking just...

05:27.291 --> 05:29.166
I saw the gunman, and I just...

05:31.083 --> 05:32.083
I ducked.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.458
Of course you ducked.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.345
It's only natural.
Everyone would've ducked.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.541
I got out of the car.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.267
I was the one to make us stay

05:52.291 --> 05:53.875
so that he could have
a fecking piss.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.708
Don't you dare give out
to yourself for that.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.125
Come here to me.

06:07.291 --> 06:08.416
Come here.

06:20.916 --> 06:22.676
Maybe I should tell Mum
about getting pissed.

06:24.833 --> 06:25.833
Why?

06:26.458 --> 06:27.916
So you don't
have to lie about it.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.458
I'm not lying, Dad.
I'm just not saying anything.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.166
Same thing, innit?

06:35.833 --> 06:37.000
It's not a big deal.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.541
As long as
it doesn't happen again.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.500
It's okay.

06:49.416 --> 06:50.416
All right?

06:53.458 --> 06:54.583
I'll be all right.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.541
What the fuck is that?

07:01.958 --> 07:03.250
It's North Stream.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.458
- Bin it.
- Yeah.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.968
He's got the feds here
keeping an eye on him.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.416
What are we sticking around for?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.059
We're gonna stay here
until the Chief say

07:21.083 --> 07:22.250
it's okay for us to go.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.000
His family know yet?

07:27.916 --> 07:28.916
Know what?

07:29.708 --> 07:30.708
Well, you know...

07:30.791 --> 07:33.625
Wasted Police Chief fucks
First Nations crack whore.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.017
Only a matter of time
before they find out.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.291
Would you shut up already?

07:37.375 --> 07:38.875
She's not a crack whore.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.125
Okay?

07:40.208 --> 07:41.226
And they're not gonna find out

07:41.250 --> 07:43.708
because no one is a big
enough asshole to tell them.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.500
I'm not leaving, Anna.

07:54.583 --> 07:55.583
We have to.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.125
It's not safe, Mum.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.166
Is it, Dad?

08:04.333 --> 08:05.500
Petey's buried here.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.250
Well, I'm going.

08:11.083 --> 08:11.916
Well, maybe she's right.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.559
Maybe we should leave.
We should go home.

08:13.583 --> 08:14.791
This is our home.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.541
We said goodbye to London.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.208
Yeah, but we thought
it was safe here, didn't we?

08:25.500 --> 08:26.916
You're a fucking coward, Jim.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.125
Protect us.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
The man I married
wasn't afraid of anything.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.833
Well, the man you married
was a pisshead.

09:21.625 --> 09:22.916
You don't need booze.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.750
Find them.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.208
Find them and kill them.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.333
You mean that?

09:44.166 --> 09:45.166
Yes.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.083
No.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.375
I don't know.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.208
Come in, Chief.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.333
Go ahead, Denise.

10:20.416 --> 10:21.833
We've got a witness.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.015
But why do we have to meet
on the reserve?

10:28.041 --> 10:29.458
It's the only place
she feels safe.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.541
She?

10:36.541 --> 10:38.000
- Fuck that.
- Okay, wait.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.625
No. Why didn't you
tell me it was her?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.767
'Cause you wouldn't have come.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.351
You're fucking right
I wouldn't have come.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.541
She said she was there the night
Suzy was murdered.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.693
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.208
- She said "murdered"?
- Yes.

10:48.291 --> 10:49.451
- And you believe her?
- Yeah.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.125
Nobody knows it was a homicide.
You need to speak to her.

10:54.416 --> 10:55.708
For fuck's sake.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.083
What, you finally remembered
my name?

11:15.416 --> 11:17.083
You know, I asked you for help?

11:17.458 --> 11:19.208
That night in the bar,
do you remember that?

11:19.291 --> 11:21.458
I told you we both knew Suzy.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.750
That she was my sponsor.
That's, that's...

11:23.833 --> 11:25.666
That's how I got into
the house that night.

11:25.750 --> 11:26.833
Tell him what night.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.500
The night I stole the Oxycon...

11:31.583 --> 11:34.208
I was there that night that guy
came from North Stream.

11:35.541 --> 11:36.625
What guy?

11:39.875 --> 11:41.333
What guy from North Stream?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.000
What guy?

11:46.916 --> 11:48.083
The Quebecois.

11:52.666 --> 11:53.750
What happened?

11:57.791 --> 11:59.250
If I tell you, then...

12:00.375 --> 12:02.541
I'm gonna end up just like Suzy.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.708
No, we won't let that
happen to you.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.791
I don't believe you.

12:09.750 --> 12:13.000
I don't even trust you.
Why should I trust you?

12:14.541 --> 12:15.750
You're afraid.

12:22.166 --> 12:24.166
We're gonna need
a sworn statement from you.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.041
Fuck this shit.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.166
I'll die in my own time. Thanks.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.250
- Mum?
- Anna.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.693
I'm coming.
Coming, coming, coming.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.583
You okay?

13:04.875 --> 13:06.583
Yeah, I just got dizzy.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.208
All right.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.416
Shit.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
You all right? Come here.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.333
Yeah, thanks.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.166
Sit here.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.666
- Sure you're all right? Yeah?
- Yeah. Shit.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.625
Stay there
I'll get you some water.

13:20.708 --> 13:21.958
Thanks.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.833
I'm sorry, I know
you don't want to be here.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.583
Doesn't matter what I want.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.375
Tsk. Anna.

13:38.833 --> 13:39.916
Why are we staying?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.708
Because your dad
and I don't run.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.166
Not from this,
or from each other.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.250
He won't let anything
happen to us.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.291
Yeah.

14:22.916 --> 14:23.750
Hello?

14:23.833 --> 14:24.833
It's me.

14:25.625 --> 14:26.625
All right?

14:27.875 --> 14:28.875
Yeah, we're staying.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.083
That's nice.

14:34.916 --> 14:35.916
You all right?

14:37.083 --> 14:38.125
Yeah, I'm all right.

14:38.833 --> 14:39.666
You?

14:39.750 --> 14:41.875
Yeah. You already asked me that.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.816
I didn't believe you
the first time.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.291
I don't want to be here.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.458
I don't blame you.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.458
Your mum and dad
holding up okay?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.500
Yeah, Dad's put
cameras everywhere.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.208
That's very sensible.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.166
Can I see you again?

15:09.541 --> 15:11.208
Yeah, I'll see
if I can get some time off.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.041
I better go.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.125
All right.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.125
They've opened up the road.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.666
We get on with it,
then we clear out.

15:31.750 --> 15:32.958
We can't.

15:33.041 --> 15:33.875
There's police everywhere,

15:33.958 --> 15:35.392
and he's got cameras
all over his house.

15:35.416 --> 15:37.208
I'm running
out of money, Whitey.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.500
I can't bankroll this forever.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.666
Is that all you care about?

15:39.750 --> 15:41.791
No, it's not just the money.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.375
It's Johnny.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.833
- What about him?
- He's scarpered.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.041
- Has he now?
- Gone for days.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.333
Well,
I told you he was unreliable.

15:55.666 --> 15:56.750
What if he talks?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.375
He won't talk.

16:07.666 --> 16:08.791
What have you done?

16:09.916 --> 16:11.333
Let's just say...

16:12.666 --> 16:14.166
we didn't see eye to eye.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.208
Christ!

16:20.958 --> 16:22.708
The girl could identify him,
Frank.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.291
It was either him or her,
and I chose him.

16:26.916 --> 16:27.976
And if you got a problem
with that,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.916
you can take it up
with my associate.

16:31.500 --> 16:35.583
From here on in, I'm in charge.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.833
Hi.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.041
Dermot.

16:55.833 --> 16:56.833
Elizabeth.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.291
You miss the circus?

17:03.083 --> 17:05.250
Journalists are scum.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.958
Well, PR girls are
golddigging home wreckers.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.290
- "PR girl"?
- I'm sorry, what was it...

17:12.790 --> 17:14.333
Vice President of...
What was it?

17:14.415 --> 17:15.875
Stakeholder Relations.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.017
Stakeholder Relations.
What is that?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.875
You get people to sign over
their land access.

17:18.958 --> 17:21.000
Is that really you?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.601
The only way to change
the oil industry

17:22.625 --> 17:23.625
is from the inside out.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.290
How much are they paying you?

17:25.375 --> 17:26.958
Don't worry, lunch is on me.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.041
So what's your angle
on the Worth case?

17:32.791 --> 17:34.125
Are you pumping me?

17:35.625 --> 17:37.166
CTNN sets the tone.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.583
Sleep with me.

17:44.750 --> 17:45.750
No.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.166
Pity.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.166
You think I whored myself out?

17:51.250 --> 17:52.375
You tell me.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.250
You were a top reporter,

17:55.875 --> 17:57.666
wellrespected critic
of the energy sector,

17:57.750 --> 17:59.642
and now you're working
for a fucking oil company?

17:59.666 --> 18:01.208
I'm making a difference

18:01.291 --> 18:03.011
by getting my hands dirty
on the front line.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.583
My God, how much
are they paying you?

18:04.666 --> 18:06.583
And protecting
an entire community.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.791
And helping this country
reach its emissions targets.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.375
Unlike you, who's sitting
in the bleachers,

18:12.458 --> 18:14.458
sniping pointlessly

18:14.541 --> 18:17.541
at an industry
that is just ignoring you.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.791
You were always a selfrighteous
dogooder, Dermot.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.291
Except when it came
to doing right by us.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.500
Be careful.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.416
You bugged
the fucking hotel now?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.291
I don't like his politics.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.166
Why? He's a little too left
of Pinochet for you?

18:40.666 --> 18:43.416
I know for a fact
what his angle will be.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.666
"Oil boom brings organized crime
to small town."

18:47.750 --> 18:50.166
Great. You're hacking
his editor's phone too?

18:51.041 --> 18:52.833
You think they don't hack ours?

18:53.916 --> 18:57.458
Negative publicity is bad
for share prices.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.666
Maybe you should find
someone else

19:01.583 --> 19:02.583
to pump.

19:04.541 --> 19:06.833
Unless you think a good pumping
will change his mind.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.208
What?

19:10.291 --> 19:11.541
Stop the car.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.250
- Keep driving.
- Stop the car.

19:20.875 --> 19:21.916
Get in.

19:22.333 --> 19:23.375
Fuck off.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.541
You want me to apologize?

19:25.625 --> 19:27.166
Sexist comments are one thing,

19:27.250 --> 19:30.291
hacking journalists' phones
is quite another.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.458
It is unethical, I don't want
anything to do with it.

19:32.541 --> 19:35.083
What's unethical is a cop
who takes drugs

19:35.166 --> 19:36.583
and sleeps with hookers.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
What?

19:44.583 --> 19:47.416
New Police Chief
is a walking scandal.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.500
Why are you telling me this?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.625
So you can pass it on
to your journalist friends.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.333
In the good old days,
it was easy.

20:11.958 --> 20:15.500
You see a guy wearing colors,
you kick the crap out of him.

20:16.666 --> 20:17.666
Simple.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.125
Cops versus bikers.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.540
You know we're not allowed
to be tough cops anymore.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.015
Meanwhile, these animals
have evolved into

20:26.041 --> 20:28.375
a nationwide network
of organized criminals.

20:29.333 --> 20:30.875
What's this got to do
with our son?

20:31.291 --> 20:32.291
Danny Lyle.

20:33.416 --> 20:34.583
Do me a favor.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.833
He's a drug addict

20:35.916 --> 20:38.083
with a history of mental illness
and violent crime.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.708
He's a fucking mess.

20:39.791 --> 20:41.750
He's Fallen, a hangaround.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.416
Punks like Danny spend years
trying to earn their patch.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.208
And then you come along.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.916
You cost the Lyles $25,000
in an oil company negotiation,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.125
and you humiliate him in public.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.500
He's never even going to
make halfpatch

20:54.583 --> 20:55.750
unless he makes you pay.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.208
Danny Lyle is fucking harmless.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.291
How do you know?

20:59.166 --> 21:02.375
Seven dead cops in the last four
years in this province alone.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.416
Every one of them
a bikercop slaying.

21:05.416 --> 21:06.791
One of them was my mentor.

21:08.958 --> 21:10.833
You might want to avert
your eyes, Mrs. Worth.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.000
You didn't tell me that you cost
the Lyles 20 grand.

21:24.708 --> 21:26.666
It was 25 actually.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.083
And I was doing them a favor.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.333
You seriously think
an oil company killed Petey?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.500
Yeah.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.103
- A Canadian oil company?
- Yeah, I do.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.833
Yeah. Killed Suzy too.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.833
How do you know?

21:46.458 --> 21:47.500
Are you drinking?

21:56.833 --> 21:57.833
No.

22:00.666 --> 22:02.458
If you drink again,
you're on your own.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.000
Now the Cheyenne,

22:19.916 --> 22:21.333
he's the Indian's Indian.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.726
They were played by
Navajo extras in the movie.

22:23.750 --> 22:24.875
They weren't even Cheyenne.

22:28.250 --> 22:31.666
This whole noble savage fantasy
is such patronizing bullshit.

22:34.541 --> 22:35.541
Are you okay?

22:36.291 --> 22:37.625
I mean, ancestry aside.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.708
Yeah, if you ever suggest...

22:40.791 --> 22:41.934
a Pocahontas roleplay
during sex,

22:41.958 --> 22:43.398
I'm gonna cut
your fucking balls off.

22:44.541 --> 22:45.625
Copy that.

22:45.708 --> 22:46.708
Feet.

22:50.291 --> 22:51.333
Who's up at the house?

22:51.416 --> 22:52.750
Federal squad car, Chief.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.750
I need to talk to you.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.958
Right, my office.

22:58.958 --> 23:00.875
You leave your post
for one fucking second,

23:00.958 --> 23:02.478
Denise will hunt you down
and kill you.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Won't you, Denise?

23:05.416 --> 23:06.583
Yes, sir.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.541
You shit in a bag
if you need to.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
Copy that, Chief. Shit in a bag.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.291
Shut the door.

23:21.291 --> 23:22.291
Son of a bitch.

23:24.583 --> 23:25.583
So...

23:27.625 --> 23:29.166
In Canada, right?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.041
Can you compel
a witness to testify?

23:32.125 --> 23:33.666
We can't find her.

23:35.291 --> 23:36.291
She's gone missing.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.125
Fuck.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.000
Well, since the last time we saw
her at the casino. I mean,

23:41.083 --> 23:42.923
should I put together
a missing persons report?

23:44.250 --> 23:45.250
No.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.755
You just... You keep looking
for her, all right?

23:50.333 --> 23:51.708
But quietly.

23:51.791 --> 23:52.791
Okay.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.958
Sitting on a gold mine here.

24:35.250 --> 24:36.875
Got big plans for this place
have you?

24:39.916 --> 24:42.166
Guess if I didn't like
your accent so much,

24:42.916 --> 24:44.958
I might tell you to mind
your own fucking business.

24:46.166 --> 24:47.166
Cheers.

24:52.666 --> 24:54.708
Seems like everyone around here
is making money

24:54.791 --> 24:56.000
except for us, bud.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.500
The feds have eyes on Danny.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.017
If we make a move
on a North Stream truck,

25:02.041 --> 25:04.361
then we're looking at four years
to life for armed robbery.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.625
You're gonna let
a 100 grand's worth of laptop

25:06.708 --> 25:07.875
slip through your fingers?

25:08.958 --> 25:11.250
Heat's on Danny.
That means the heat's on us too.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.375
We call off the robbery.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.892
Looks like the feds
are fingering those bikers

25:18.916 --> 25:20.041
for the dead kid.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.000
That's good, isn't it?

25:22.083 --> 25:23.166
If the heat's on those lot,

25:23.250 --> 25:25.210
that explains why they're
calling off the robbery.

25:25.625 --> 25:26.625
What robbery?

25:26.708 --> 25:28.291
Shut up, Frank!

25:39.458 --> 25:40.750
I got a plan.

26:12.041 --> 26:13.458
It's fucking horrible
here, innit?

26:14.750 --> 26:16.791
If I asked you to tell me
the truth, would you?

26:16.916 --> 26:17.916
Yeah.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.875
That night you drank,
what happened?

26:24.875 --> 26:25.958
Got pissed.

26:26.041 --> 26:27.041
What else?

26:31.875 --> 26:33.458
The rest is a bit
of a blur, really.

26:34.416 --> 26:35.458
You know?

26:36.083 --> 26:37.625
You must remember something.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.583
Not much.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.208
Dad.

26:41.708 --> 26:42.708
What?

26:43.250 --> 26:44.250
The truth.

26:46.958 --> 26:48.333
Woke up on the reserve.

26:51.666 --> 26:52.666
Who with?

26:53.500 --> 26:54.500
No one.

26:57.541 --> 26:59.041
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.125
No.

27:28.416 --> 27:29.416
What?

27:29.458 --> 27:32.083
Get out, get out, get out.
No. No, no, no.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.750
Jim.

27:35.916 --> 27:36.958
No!

28:12.041 --> 28:14.708
Four of the country's
topselling papers

28:14.791 --> 28:18.208
as well as CBC, CTV and TVA,

28:18.291 --> 28:19.916
are taking O'Hanrahan's.

28:20.625 --> 28:24.166
"Oil refinery brings organized
crime to small town" lead.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.666
Not if you leak
the Police Chief's

28:26.750 --> 28:29.750
"drugfueled sex
with hooker" story.

28:31.958 --> 28:35.541
Details are in there.
Plus a list of witnesses.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.500
A Tribal Elder,

28:38.041 --> 28:39.333
a couple of constables,

28:40.041 --> 28:43.208
though they are strictly
off the record.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.708
You're asking me to destroy
this man's family.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.083
We go online

28:49.166 --> 28:53.458
in 16 hours with an 8.5 billion
dollar refinery that is

28:54.041 --> 28:56.916
specifically designed
to clean up dirty oil

28:57.000 --> 29:00.083
and you're going to let
the press shit all over it?

29:01.250 --> 29:02.500
This is your moment.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.416
This is what we hired you to do,

29:06.500 --> 29:07.500
to win

29:09.000 --> 29:11.416
by any means necessary.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Take it.

29:18.291 --> 29:20.333
Tire tread forensics
put Danny Lyle's pickup

29:20.416 --> 29:21.333
at the gas station.

29:21.416 --> 29:22.416
So he stopped for gas.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.625
Black poncho in the back
of the cab

29:24.708 --> 29:26.583
matches Anna's description
of the gunman,

29:26.666 --> 29:27.958
so do Danny's height and build.

29:28.041 --> 29:29.583
Doesn't prove he killed our boy.

29:30.208 --> 29:32.541
No, but it makes him
our most probable suspect.

29:34.083 --> 29:37.583
Or it would, if Wallace Lyle
hadn't come forward as an alibi

29:38.500 --> 29:40.458
after having said
in his deposition that he was

29:41.333 --> 29:42.833
flatout drunk at the time.

29:43.583 --> 29:44.625
So he's lying?

29:44.708 --> 29:47.166
If you made a public appeal
for help,

29:47.500 --> 29:49.625
it might make Wallace
change his mind.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.625
- Fuck off.
- It's not your decision.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.068
Can we have
a moment alone, please?

29:53.166 --> 29:54.166
Of course.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.208
Jim, this man is
an experienced police...

30:02.291 --> 30:04.208
With an ancient fucking grudge

30:04.291 --> 30:06.375
against a bunch of
bullshit bikers.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.226
Danny's not
a hangaround, anyway.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.125
He's a full patch.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.083
Okay.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.875
But I don't understand.
I mean, why not do it?

30:12.958 --> 30:14.083
What have we got to lose?

30:14.166 --> 30:15.958
'Cause he's talking out
of his fucking ass!

30:17.500 --> 30:18.750
How do you know?

30:22.166 --> 30:24.166
No, what? Is there
something you're not telling me?

30:28.833 --> 30:29.958
Well, what?

30:31.041 --> 30:32.041
Like what?

30:32.875 --> 30:34.541
Like why you're being
such an arsehole.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.708
Stop it.

30:36.041 --> 30:37.361
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.

30:37.916 --> 30:39.791
No, you never
do anything, do you?

30:39.875 --> 30:41.583
Jesus, it's never your fault.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.208
I'll do it. I'll talk.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
What?

30:53.333 --> 30:54.208
Maybe I should tell the police

30:54.291 --> 30:56.251
you and Mum are planning
to murder whoever did it.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.333
This was a savage,
premeditated attack

31:35.875 --> 31:38.291
that resulted in the tragic
death of a 5yearold child.

31:39.125 --> 31:41.291
We're appealing to
anyone with information

31:41.375 --> 31:43.875
to come forward
and assist us in our inquiries.

31:47.458 --> 31:48.458
Mrs. Worth.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.041
You...

31:53.625 --> 31:55.041
look for somewhere safe

31:56.458 --> 31:57.958
to bring up your children.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.583
That's one of the reasons
why we came here.

32:03.833 --> 32:05.000
And Petey...

32:08.583 --> 32:10.125
Petey loved it here.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
He loved...

32:17.291 --> 32:18.500
the river, and

32:19.125 --> 32:20.166
the woods, and

32:20.916 --> 32:22.000
the mountains.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.208
And now he's...

32:32.208 --> 32:33.333
He's buried

32:34.958 --> 32:35.958
in the graveyard,

32:39.958 --> 32:41.375
and I just want to know why.

32:56.333 --> 32:57.500
Oil.

33:32.041 --> 33:34.083
You are a PR girl

33:35.333 --> 33:39.541
sitting in the eye
of a PR shitstorm.

33:41.875 --> 33:45.791
And downtown,
they won't just fire you,

33:47.583 --> 33:50.916
they will put an asterisk
by your name.

34:06.541 --> 34:08.708
North Stream's
share price took a tumble today

34:08.791 --> 34:11.125
amidst further delays
and increasing controversy

34:11.208 --> 34:13.833
for their flagship
tar sands refinery.

34:13.916 --> 34:16.208
Dermot O'Hanrahan reports
from Little Big Bear.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.375
Well, local police services
in Canada

34:19.458 --> 34:21.958
carry a huge amount
of public popularity.

34:22.041 --> 34:24.875
And support for this
exBritish policeman

34:24.958 --> 34:28.333
who moved here with his family
looking for a better life...

34:29.583 --> 34:32.125
but instead met
with tragedy, is growing.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.820
How serious
are the Police Chief's

34:34.875 --> 34:36.000
allegations being taken?

34:39.125 --> 34:40.958
Yeah, yeah.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.333
You're having a heart attack.

35:06.708 --> 35:07.708
Help?

35:15.166 --> 35:16.500
All you gotta do...

35:18.500 --> 35:19.750
is sign.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.208
Elizabeth.

36:17.958 --> 36:18.958
Dermot.

36:19.416 --> 36:22.416
I have some information for you
regarding the Police Chief.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.916
It has to be his disease.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.375
'Cause if it's not,
he's just an...

36:34.583 --> 36:37.875
arrogant, deluded arsehole,
and he's not.

36:39.208 --> 36:40.416
He's a good man.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.958
He just can't help himself.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.916
You know I love him, right?

36:49.791 --> 36:50.916
God knows I love him.

36:52.541 --> 36:54.461
It's taken me 20 years
to realize that he just...

36:55.791 --> 36:57.458
might never change.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.500
Is he drinking?

37:08.375 --> 37:09.416
Anna.

37:18.583 --> 37:20.625
Is he? Drinking?

37:26.250 --> 37:27.250
Jesus.

37:28.708 --> 37:29.916
I'm so sorry.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.041
Stay here.

37:33.708 --> 37:34.791
ANGELA Shit.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.125
- Hello.
- Mrs. Worth?

37:41.708 --> 37:42.916
Who are you?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.267
What do you say
to the allegations

37:44.291 --> 37:47.125
that your husband is using drugs
and sleeping with prostitutes?

37:47.541 --> 37:48.583
Why don't you fuck off?

38:21.583 --> 38:25.708
I don't know...
I don't know what shape God is.

38:27.875 --> 38:31.000
Whether He's power
or energy or whatever.

38:34.166 --> 38:35.250
But...

38:35.541 --> 38:38.250
He's the only one
on a dark night

38:38.333 --> 38:41.375
who can see a black insect
inside a black dog.

38:45.083 --> 38:46.166
'Cause He sees everything.

38:48.916 --> 38:50.583
And He knows.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.416
He knows I'd never hurt a kid.

39:03.833 --> 39:04.833
Stay calm, please.

39:04.875 --> 39:05.875
Hold him.

39:11.541 --> 39:12.666
Stay still!

39:21.208 --> 39:22.333
What you do to him?

39:23.875 --> 39:25.500
Depends. To whom?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.166
Danny's brother.

39:28.916 --> 39:30.476
How'd you get him to withdraw
his alibi?

39:31.708 --> 39:32.833
What are you saying, Chief?

39:33.375 --> 39:34.375
Don't fuck about.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.333
Was it like
the good old days, was it?

39:37.458 --> 39:38.666
Cops versus bikers.

39:39.625 --> 39:41.425
Only this time,
you had to beat up an old man.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.970
Are you accusing me
of assaulting a witness?

39:51.416 --> 39:52.916
Get the fuck out of my office.

39:54.541 --> 39:55.958
Get the fuck out of my town.

41:52.916 --> 41:54.375
- What's going on?
- Get out.

41:56.291 --> 41:57.625
- What?
- Get the fuck out.

42:02.708 --> 42:03.708
Anna?

42:03.791 --> 42:05.375
Don't you dare
bring her into this.

42:46.625 --> 42:47.958
It's armored glass, asshole.

42:50.750 --> 42:51.791
Better get out of the way!

42:56.041 --> 42:57.291
Don't say I didn't warn you.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.666
What the f...

43:42.791 --> 43:43.791
Whiskey.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.013
North Stream's reporting
a distress signal.

45:26.875 --> 45:27.875
Fuck 'em.

45:27.916 --> 45:29.458
Possible robbery in progress.

45:29.541 --> 45:30.541
Chief.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.291
Calling all units.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.250
What am I supposed to do?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.083
Have a drink?

45:37.958 --> 45:39.083
Am I on my own here?

45:40.291 --> 45:42.416
Distress signal from
North Stream supply vehicle.

45:42.500 --> 45:45.041
Location, 12 clicks east
of Maple on Highway 40.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I'm on my way.

46:51.750 --> 46:52.833
Same again.

46:53.305 --> 46:59.266
