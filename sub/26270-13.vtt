WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.742
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
Empire, Star, and The Resident.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.482
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.023
I have an adult male

00:23.057 --> 00:24.692
with multiple stab wounds
to his torso.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.160
Need medical
and police response.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.928
JOSH:
Okay, sir, can I get your name?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.397
Evan Buckley.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.499
I'm a firefighter with the 118.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.335
-Buck?
-Yeah, uh, victim
is Howard Han.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.237
He's got profuse bleeding
to his abdomen.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.106
Breathing is labored.
Might have hit a lung.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.374
Come on, Chim. Hang in there.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.942
JOSH:
Buck, RA unit's two minutes out.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.211
Do you know how this happened?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.945
-How long has he been down?
-I don't know.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.414
I just got home and found him.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.616
Given the amount of blood,
I would say minutes, not hours.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.750
JOSH:
How's his pulse?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.222
Weak, but it's there.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.690
-Jason...
-H-Hold on, he's, uh...

00:56.724 --> 00:59.527
he's talking. Chim, it's me,
it's Buck. I'm here, okay?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.262
I just need you
to stay with me, Chimney.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.931
-Jason took her...
-Chimney, who is Jason?

01:03.964 --> 01:05.799
Maddie...

01:05.833 --> 01:07.968
(sirens approaching)

01:08.001 --> 01:09.203
Where is Maddie?

01:09.237 --> 01:11.071
Chimney, where is Maddie?

01:11.105 --> 01:13.241
Chimney,
where is Maddie?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.143
-Wh-Where is Maddie?
-(siren wailing)

01:18.112 --> 01:20.248
-We got it, sir.
-Maddie!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.915
Maddie!

01:23.951 --> 01:25.286
Maddie.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.787
Maddie, where are you?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.357
Maddie! Maddie, are in you here?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.128
Maddie!

01:34.162 --> 01:36.164
(panting)

01:38.166 --> 01:40.901
She's, uh... she's not here.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.836
She's gone.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.872
Oh, no.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.009
JOSH:
Buck? What is it, Buck?

01:51.044 --> 01:53.046
Did you find something?

01:54.682 --> 01:58.018
All of her stuff is still here.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.122
All units responding
to 1832 Bryson,

02:02.156 --> 02:05.793
be advised we also have
a critical missing adult female:

02:05.826 --> 02:07.795
Maddie Buckley Kendall.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.897
He found her.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.037
(rummaging,
drawers opening and closing)

02:19.039 --> 02:22.343
-Hey, babe, where's the thing?
-MADDIE: What thing?

02:22.376 --> 02:25.012
That fancy opener
that I took out a loan for.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.982
Screw it. I'm going old-school.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.851
("Nothing Can Change This Love"
by Sam Cooke playing)

02:30.884 --> 02:32.720
Made a mix,
some of your favorites.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.722
Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.225
Nice. Greatest love songs
ever written.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.560
-(chuckles)
-And every one of them

02:39.593 --> 02:41.395
reminds me of you.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.696
You're sweet.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.666
I am, it would appear,

02:45.699 --> 02:47.468
the heart surgeon
that stole your heart.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.672
Not just surgeon; the chief
of cardiothoracic medicine.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.174
I'm really proud of you.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.847
Second-youngest in the state,
which my father would file under

02:59.880 --> 03:02.149
the "Close But Not Quite"
Department.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.318
But screw him, right?

03:04.352 --> 03:06.086
We're celebrating anyway.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.589
No, no, put away those
Two-Buck Chuck glasses.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.091
An occasion like this

03:11.124 --> 03:15.195
requires something
more distinctive.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.401
Wow, we haven't, uh,
used those since the wedding.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.003
Yeah.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.873
One of the few things
I have left of my mother.

03:25.906 --> 03:30.711
* You're the apple of my eye *

03:30.744 --> 03:31.912
* You're cherry pie... *

03:31.945 --> 03:33.447
Toast softer this time.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.782
The chip is still there.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.521
This promotion, it's not because
of some good-luck glasses.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.524
* Sugar and spice *

03:43.557 --> 03:45.559
It's because of my
good-luck girl.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.061
* And everything nice... *

03:48.095 --> 03:51.098
To my Maddie.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.201
* My, my, my, my dreams *

03:54.234 --> 03:58.038
* But if you wanted *

03:58.071 --> 04:01.542
* To leave me and roam *

04:01.575 --> 04:03.411
* When you got back *

04:03.444 --> 04:04.778
(laughter)

04:04.812 --> 04:08.616
* I'd just say, "Welcome home" *

04:08.649 --> 04:10.718
-* 'Cause, honey, nothing... *
-(laughter, muttering)

04:10.751 --> 04:12.720
-* Nothing... *
-(music stops abruptly)

04:12.753 --> 04:15.188
(gasps)

04:16.424 --> 04:18.426
Accidents happen, right?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.731
My mother always used to say
that an accident

04:23.764 --> 04:25.699
is just an opportunity to learn.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.503
The problem, Maddie,
is that you never do.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.307
-(passing car honks horn)
-Damn it, Maddie!

04:33.341 --> 04:35.275
This is your fault.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.578
I told you, I told you
you couldn't leave me.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.113
-I warned you.
-(crying): Is he dead?

04:40.147 --> 04:42.316
If he's not, he will be.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.952
-He's not our problem anymore.
-Why would you do that?

04:44.985 --> 04:48.522
He's-he's such a-a kind man.
He was so good.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.124
You think I don't know that?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.427
I didn't want to hurt him.
I liked Chimney.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.964
-We were friends.
-What?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.198
But you cloud me, Maddie.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.167
You fog up my head.
You always have.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.302
If you'd have just stayed.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.304
Doug, how long
have you been here?

05:04.338 --> 05:06.206
I needed to make sure
you were safe.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.778
I saw you with Buck,
I thought, all right, fine.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.947
She needs some time,
just give her some space.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.349
She'll come home.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.351
She always comes home.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.720
And then Chimney told me
you asked him out,

05:19.753 --> 05:22.823
and I knew...
I knew I waited too long.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.224
No.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.159
No, can you just pull over?
We can talk.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.528
It's not too late.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.398
Of course it's too late.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.567
I just killed a man
for you, Maddie.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.537
There is no coming back
from that.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.206
Not for me, and not for you.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.215
(indistinct chatter)

05:49.249 --> 05:51.318
I got here as fast as I could.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.753
How's he doing?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.888
Alive, but he's got
a punctured lung

05:54.922 --> 05:56.390
and a lacerated stomach.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.891
Is he in surgery?

05:57.925 --> 06:00.360
Not yet.
He lost a lot of blood.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.497
But as soon as he's stable,
they'll prep him for surgery.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.566
Who would do something
like this?

06:05.599 --> 06:07.367
BUCK:
It was Doug.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.769
Doug Kendall.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.371
He told Maddie he would kill her
if she left him.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.673
He did this.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.007
You said he lives
in Pennsylvania.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.676
He knows she was here?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.711
-No, she-she...
-ATHENA: She was filing
for divorce.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.613
That could have put her
back on his radar.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.782
MARKS:
Well, we'll take a look at him,
but before your friend

06:21.815 --> 06:24.552
lost consciousness,
he said he was attacked

06:24.585 --> 06:26.219
by a Jason Bailey.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.221
Either of you know who that is?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.223
I don't think so.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.293
Wait, uh...

06:33.326 --> 06:36.363
Wait. Hold on, Detective.
I know he had a new friend,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.298
some guy he was...
he was playing pool with.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.634
I never met him,
but now I know why, you know,

06:40.668 --> 06:43.270
'cause it was Doug.
He got close to Chimney

06:43.303 --> 06:45.405
so that he could
get close to Maddie.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.109
You don't believe me?
I mean, I mean,

06:49.142 --> 06:50.878
Chimney's phone is right there.
You know, ch-check for yourself.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.379
Phone's locked.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.882
Can't open it without
the victim's consent.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.149
ATHENA:
They'll subpoena
his phone records,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.918
but it'll take time.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.987
Well, Maddie doesn't
have time, okay?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.722
Come on, Doug did this!

07:01.755 --> 07:04.324
He-he almost killed
Chimney, and...

07:04.357 --> 07:06.594
and he could...
he could kill her next.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.661
-But he didn't.
-Bobby...

07:07.695 --> 07:09.096
Buck, just listen to me.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.430
Buck, may-maybe you're right.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.099
It's Doug.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.902
And he found out where
Maddie was, and he came here,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.605
and he hurt Chimney,
but Maddie's not here,

07:17.638 --> 07:19.840
and if all he wanted to do
was kill her...

07:21.542 --> 07:23.276
Then I would have
found her, too.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.413
And you didn't.
She was alive when he took her,

07:26.446 --> 07:29.617
and that's what we're gonna
hold onto right now.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.927
Um, uh...

07:39.960 --> 07:42.195
Can I... can I... can I...
can I change my shirt?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.197
Uh, it-it's covered in...

07:44.231 --> 07:46.266
Fine, just don't touch anything.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.703
And bag his shirt
when he's done.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.272
Athena, someone
has to prepare him.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.707
We're not there yet.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.443
You don't think you're gonna
find her alive.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.379
The most dangerous time
for a woman in these situations.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.048
When she leaves.
Maddie knew that.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.883
That's why she was in hiding.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.885
But if it is him...

08:04.918 --> 08:09.623
Those scenarios usually don't
come with a happy ending.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.892
BUCK:
Hey, Cap, I need
to go to the hospital.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.829
I-I-I want to see Chimney.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.264
I'll drive him.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.803
-Anyone see anything?
-No witnesses.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.873
We're still trying to access
her security footage,

08:25.906 --> 08:28.475
but a camera across the street

08:28.508 --> 08:31.879
caught a man
forcing her into his car.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.514
All we got is a four-door sedan,
dark in color.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.584
Doesn't exactly
narrow the search.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.385
Mm.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.191
Where's Chimney's phone?

08:50.731 --> 08:53.500
(monitor beeping)

08:53.533 --> 08:55.535
(sighs)
Sorry about this, buddy.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.240
You're not supposed
to be in here.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.175
-Oh, oh, God,
please don't let him die.
-Please, sir.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.077
-You have to go back
to the lobby.
-You can't, you can't die on me.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.713
-Sir, you need to leave. No.
-You can't, please...

09:05.746 --> 09:07.815
-Sir, you have to go.
-Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.287
ATHENA:
You know, Detective Marks
didn't believe me.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.024
He said no one
could be that stupid.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.326
I said, "You don't know Buck."

09:37.410 --> 09:38.779
So...

09:38.812 --> 09:41.481
that was a bold move.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.550
Yeah, yeah, I know.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.386
"What were you thinking, Buck?"

09:46.419 --> 09:48.388
I already got an earful
from Athena.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.792
Oh, no, I know what you were
thinking. I got sisters, too.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.727
(chuckles)
Still not sure how you thought

09:53.761 --> 09:56.396
you were getting away
with it, though.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.499
-I wasn't worried about that.
-Mm.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.635
It's, like, police have
all these rules, you know?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.672
Rules that are
gonna get Maddie killed.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.807
But-but I'm a civilian.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.809
Those rules, they don't
apply to me, right?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.844
Then why are you
in hospital jail?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.382
(Eddie sighs)

10:16.549 --> 10:18.919
I told Maddie...

10:18.952 --> 10:22.589
I said that she didn't need
to keep on running,

10:22.622 --> 10:26.493
that she could start over here,
that she would be safe.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.530
That I would keep her safe.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.534
(sighs)

10:37.237 --> 10:39.239
This isn't your fault.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.978
What if she had kept running?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.614
You think he wouldn't
have found her?

10:47.647 --> 10:51.451
Only then, she'd be alone.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.955
She's alone now,

10:54.988 --> 10:56.790
with him.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.992
ATHENA:
I spoke with Detective Marks.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.527
-He's not happy with you.
-I-I-I just...

11:00.560 --> 11:02.129
Yeah, you broke
chain of custody.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.197
You unlocked Chimney's phone
without his permission.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.533
-Marks can't use any of it.
-I'm sorry.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.036
Okay? I was trying to help.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.539
Okay. Let's go.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.474
The car's out front.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.376
You're arresting me.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.679
Not yet.
But the night's still young.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.354
Uh, wh-where are we going?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.022
To find your sister.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.225
If Doug is Jason,
this phone is how we find him.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.827
But we gonna need a little help.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.896
I thought you said
we couldn't use the phone.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.530
I said Marks can't use it.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.066
This isn't my case.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.468
I'm just a concerned friend
of the victim.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.537
Thank you.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.575
Buck.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.544
Here are the ground rules:

11:51.578 --> 11:53.781
You don't leave her sight,
you don't lie,

11:53.814 --> 11:55.849
you don't withhold
any information from her,

11:55.883 --> 11:57.885
you don't break the law,
and you don't do anything

11:57.918 --> 11:59.920
that's gonna force her into
early retirement. You got it?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.755
You got it, Cap.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.034
(electronic chiming)

12:14.067 --> 12:16.036
DOUG:
Come on. Where is it?

12:16.069 --> 12:19.907
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Continue following the road
for 1.7 miles.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.278
I don't... I don't see anything.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.188
-Just do it already.
-What?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.625
Kill me.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.494
That's your plan, right?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.596
Kill Chimney, kill me;
hopefully, do the world a favor

12:43.630 --> 12:45.598
and kill yourself
before it's done.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.634
Why would I kill you, Maddie?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.636
I don't want to hurt you.
I love you.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.071
I can't imagine my life
without you.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.440
You're all I have.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.143
You don't have me.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.212
Your destination
is on the right.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
DOUG:
There it is.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.951
You see?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.186
Never give up hope.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.200
(bell chimes)

13:24.071 --> 13:26.073
Don't move.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.053
(phone chimes)

13:49.396 --> 13:51.264
(banging)

13:59.172 --> 14:00.908
SUE:
I'm not sure
how we can help, Sergeant,

14:00.941 --> 14:03.310
but whatever you need.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.313
Athena, please. I'm off duty.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.315
This is Josh.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.883
Athena.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.318
And Buck, Maddie's brother.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.520
Maddie's told me
a lot about you.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.088
Same here.
Any word on her?

14:15.122 --> 14:16.589
ATHENA:
Well, police don't have much

14:16.623 --> 14:19.026
to go on yet.
So, neither one of us are good

14:19.059 --> 14:21.328
at sitting around and waiting,
so I thought I'd come by

14:21.361 --> 14:24.531
-and ask you some questions,
unofficially.
-Sure.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.167
-What do you want to know?
-Well, when people dial 911,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.768
you can see where
they're calling from, right?

14:28.801 --> 14:31.238
If they're calling
from a landline, absolutely.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.672
Cell phones are trickier.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.241
We don't get
an automatic address.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.376
Our system has
to digitally request

14:36.409 --> 14:38.511
the phone's location
from the cellular network.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.048
Okay, well,
this is Chimney's phone.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.683
We think he was in contact
with his attacker.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.585
-Maddie's husband.
-BUCK: Uh, Chimney didn't know

14:45.618 --> 14:48.355
it was him; he-he thought
his name was Jason.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.190
ATHENA:
Now, I'm wondering,
hypothetically,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.225
if this number called 911
and hung up,

14:52.259 --> 14:53.893
is your system able to request

14:53.927 --> 14:57.030
location data
after the call was disconnected?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.966
Hypothetically, sure.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.201
-But we'd...
-Of course we could.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.970
You know, it's funny,

15:03.003 --> 15:04.871
this number seems familiar,
and, in fact,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.706
I think I might have taken
a call from it earlier.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.508
An emergency call.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.911
SUE:
Josh,

15:11.945 --> 15:13.981
are you sure?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.283
I'm sure.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.954
Okay.
Let's make a manual request.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.689
(keyboard clicking)

15:23.790 --> 15:26.193
*

15:48.648 --> 15:50.517
DOUG:
Hey, where you going?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.752
Oh, I-I was looking for you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.654
I have to pee.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.023
Yeah? You sure that's all?

15:56.056 --> 15:58.025
Y-Yeah.
I mean, look around, Doug.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.792
Where am I going to run to?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.129
Do you want me to pee
in the restroom or the car?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.734
(knife clicks)

16:13.173 --> 16:15.308
Keep your head down.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.215
CASHIER:
Evening.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.387
-You folks doing okay?
-Yeah, good. Um,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.156
do you have a restroom
that I could use?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.158
Uh, I feel like we've been
on the road forever.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.293
Sure thing.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.562
In the back, to the left.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.830
* Will make foolish people do *

16:37.864 --> 16:39.899
Thank you.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.238
* I never dreamed
that I'd meet *

16:45.272 --> 16:47.407
* Somebody like you... *

16:47.440 --> 16:50.243
(door opens, closes)

16:50.277 --> 16:52.212
(lock clicks)

16:57.084 --> 16:59.686
You folks vacationing?

16:59.719 --> 17:03.056
Yeah. Second honeymoon.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.195
(panting)

17:24.244 --> 17:25.912
You okay, babe?

17:25.945 --> 17:28.348
MADDIE:
Yeah. Yeah, I-I'll be out
in a minute.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.218
-(pounding on door)
-Let's go.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.088
(pounding on door)

17:35.122 --> 17:36.323
Let's go, Maddie.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.403
(grunts)

17:54.841 --> 17:56.309
-Maddie!
-(gasps) No!

17:56.343 --> 17:58.044
You're always running.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.812
Aren't you tired by now?
I sure am tired

17:59.846 --> 18:01.481
-of chasing you.
-Just let me go.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.150
Please just let me go.
Let me go!

18:03.183 --> 18:04.917
-(gun clicks)
-CASHIER: Hey!

18:04.951 --> 18:06.453
-No...
-You heard the lady.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.055
Back away. Let her go.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.491
Oh, no. Sir, honestly,
I-I think that you've...

18:11.524 --> 18:13.092
-I said back away.
-I-I think you're
misunderstanding.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.894
Back away, man.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.429
(grunting and groaning)

18:26.373 --> 18:27.674
-(gunshot)
-(cashier groans)

18:27.707 --> 18:29.108
-(Maddie screams)
-DOUG: Oh, God.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.578
Oh, my God.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.080
-(panting)
-MADDIE: Sir...

18:34.113 --> 18:36.349
Sir, stay with me, okay?
I'm gonna call 911,

18:36.383 --> 18:38.418
and they are gonna save you.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.752
Stay with me. Okay, it's okay.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.621
-Stay with me.
-(gunshot)

18:41.654 --> 18:43.823
(gasps, shudders)

18:47.527 --> 18:49.128
(crying):
Oh, my God.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.135
No one's saving anyone now.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.904
-Let's go. Let's go.
-(crying): No, no...

19:05.144 --> 19:06.946
So, Chimney goes online
to one of those

19:06.979 --> 19:09.182
Internet forums for new mothers.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.484
They all give him advice.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.320
"Skin-to-skin contact
works best."

19:13.353 --> 19:15.955
"No, the sound
of a-a vacuum cleaner."

19:15.988 --> 19:17.657
"A cool breeze is soothing."

19:17.690 --> 19:20.159
A vacuum to stop a baby crying?
I missed out on all this.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.794
Which one did he go with?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.730
-All of them.
-(laughter)

19:23.763 --> 19:26.633
We come home and find him
asleep-- shirtless--

19:26.666 --> 19:28.468
on the floor with Denny
on top of him,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.169
a fan blowing at them

19:30.203 --> 19:32.339
and the vacuum cleaner
running in the corner.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.540
(laughter)

19:33.573 --> 19:36.175
Wow, uh, he went all out, huh?

19:36.209 --> 19:38.010
He always does.

19:38.044 --> 19:42.014
He always puts his heart
into everything.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.751
-Hey, hey.
-Hey.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.186
-What are you guys doing here?
-Oh, Harry and I were out.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.388
I needed to get some coffee.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.822
Then we thought,

19:49.856 --> 19:51.824
you guys probably
need some, too.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.760
Ah, we haven't met,
but I love you. Eddie.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.662
Michael. Pleasure.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.265
-Hey, this is a surprise.
-HARRY: We brought food.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.166
-Got you a bear claw.
-That's my favorite.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.669
-Thank you.
-You check on Chim?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.437
Yeah, he's still in surgery.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.205
It's starting to feel
like an annual tradition.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.174
Another hospital, another
girlfriend not by his bedside

20:08.207 --> 20:10.042
and me wondering
what I'm supposed to tell him

20:10.076 --> 20:12.745
-when he wakes up.
-We'll tell him the truth.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.781
Whatever that turns out to be.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.717
All right.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.352
Thank you.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.588
-Very thoughtful.
-Oh, it's Harry's idea.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.523
You know, he was worried,
so he wanted to come down

20:23.556 --> 20:25.124
and make sure
everything was okay.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.859
Eh, he's a sweet kid.
It's nice of him

20:26.893 --> 20:28.194
to be worried about Chimney.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.497
Uh, he wasn't worried
about Chimney.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.366
He was worried about you.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
(line ringing)

20:34.767 --> 20:35.935
MARKS:
Detective Marks.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.937
Andy, it's Athena.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.139
Listen, you're gonna get
a call from Sue Blevins

20:40.172 --> 20:41.774
at 911 dispatch.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.577
She might have a lead
on Doug's location.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.313
MARKS:
Do I want to know
how she obtained

20:46.346 --> 20:47.914
this very important
information?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.283
Let's just call it
an anonymous tip and not look

20:50.317 --> 20:52.552
any gift horses in the mouth.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.622
-We'll meet you there.
-Copy that. (sighs)

20:55.655 --> 20:57.457
(phone beeps)

20:57.490 --> 20:59.926
You're awfully quiet
over there, Buckaroo.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.464
Uh, when we get there...

21:06.265 --> 21:09.769
...what-what do you think
we're going to find?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.771
I mean, he-he threatened
to kill her, you know,

21:11.804 --> 21:12.972
a-almost did kill Chimney.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.408
-What if... what if he...
-No.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.110
My gut is telling me not to
count your sister out just yet.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.447
Maddie didn't just
rebuild her life.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.449
She rebuilt herself.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.585
Doug may have her, but I don't
think he has any idea

21:25.618 --> 21:27.654
who he's dealing with now.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.474
(siren wailing)

21:47.507 --> 21:48.808
DOUG:
Damn it.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.736
We have to get off this road.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.571
Just shut up.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.908
There were cameras, Doug.
When they find that guy...

22:21.941 --> 22:23.910
Do you think this was my fault?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.912
No.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.180
-No, it was my fault.
-That's right.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.850
That's what happens when you try
to run away from me, Maddie.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.419
-People get hurt.
-Yeah, I know.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.853
I'm done running.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.322
You must think I'm an idiot.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.357
I think you're a monster.
I don't think you're...

22:43.863 --> 22:46.566
-That was honest, anyway.
-I mean it.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.436
I can't stand the idea
of one more person dying,

22:49.469 --> 22:53.940
so I'm not gonna run, Doug.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.575
You've got me.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.577
But we have to get off
this road.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.412
We need to figure this out.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.880
Is that what
you're gonna do, Maddie?

23:00.913 --> 23:02.081
You're gonna help me
figure this out?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.083
That's what I do.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.085
I help people think clearly
in a crisis.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.355
-I am thinking clearly.
-Yeah? So where are we going?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.691
I'll figure it out.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.693
The longer we are on this road,

23:13.726 --> 23:15.862
the more likely it is
that we get pulled over,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.865
and we both know how that ends.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.168
So what do you suggest?

23:26.072 --> 23:30.309
I saw signs for... for Big Bear
a few miles back.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.479
There are vacation homes.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.648
Probably empty.

23:35.682 --> 23:38.651
Like the Poconos.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.521
Yeah. You'll love it.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.629
(sniffles)

23:58.137 --> 24:00.473
(monitor beeping)

24:05.177 --> 24:07.446
Hi, Chimney.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.517
Hey.

24:12.519 --> 24:15.154
I heard you had another surgery.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.223
Yeah.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.494
I guess I'm catching up
with you.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.030
Hey.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.599
You're awake.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.467
Looks like you got
your first visitor.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.369
Does your dad know
you're in here?

24:30.402 --> 24:31.804
(whispers):
Chris.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.506
I'm gonna say no.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.476
Welcome back, man.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.612
We were worried about you.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.213
I wasn't worried.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.782
I'm starting to think
he's invincible.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.884
-Like a superhero?
-Yeah.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.519
Just like a superhero.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.789
EDDIE:
Okay, buddy.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.323
Let's, uh, let Chimney rest.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.225
We can visit him later.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.697
Don't eat the meat loaf.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.365
No?

24:59.398 --> 25:01.400
That's how I lost a tooth.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.203
Thanks for the tip, buddy.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.404
EDDIE:
Let's go.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.608
Have a good rest.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.086
Where's Maddie?

25:25.424 --> 25:27.026
TRUCK DRIVER:
It's not my phone.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.762
I don't know where it came from.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.397
Found the phone.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.399
No sign of our suspect
or your sister.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.902
Yeah, but he has
Doug's phone. How?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.004
Well, driver left
Salt Lake City yesterday.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.272
Been on the road ever since.
Says he's got no clue

25:40.306 --> 25:42.108
how the phone ended up
in his truck.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.943
Sir, you make any stops?

25:43.976 --> 25:46.078
Gas station,
just before sunrise.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.114
See anybody else there?

25:48.147 --> 25:52.218
When I was leaving, saw a couple
going into the store.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.420
He knew we could use
the phone to track him.

25:54.453 --> 25:58.324
Probably dropped it in the truck
just to throw us off.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.228
So they could be
anywhere by now.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.632
Yeah. And Doug's
way ahead of us.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.445
I don't think I brought enough.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.248
No, you brought
everything I needed.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.618
Missed the whole day with him.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.153
I know.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.655
That's why we came.

26:28.688 --> 26:31.991
Well, that and I remember

26:32.024 --> 26:34.493
what it was like
to live at a hospital.

26:34.526 --> 26:38.097
Uncomfortable chairs,
terrible food.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.431
You don't have to stay.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.267
I-I mean,
if you have stuff to do...

26:41.300 --> 26:43.302
No.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.304
I'm good here.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.309
(indistinct chatter over radio)

26:50.342 --> 26:52.845
MARKS:
We only have eyes on the pumps
and the register.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.480
Now, best we can guess,

26:54.513 --> 26:57.416
she goes out the back window,
husband catches her.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.252
Yeah, cashier sees
something's wrong. Goes to help.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.954
Winds up getting shot
with his own gun.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.190
Guess he thought
he could handle it on his own.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.199
Sir.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.901
Found this in the bathroom.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.271
It's a rental car agreement.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.841
For a dark gray,
four-door sedan.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.876
Looks like she started
to write "help" on the back.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.544
Rented near Burbank Airport.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.880
I'll put out an APB.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.216
Well, we know
where he rented the car.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.051
Maybe we can use that
to track him.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.053
Uh, like LoJack.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.188
Well, rental car companies
don't use GPS tracking.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.824
-It's too expensive.
-Yeah.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.225
Major companies don't.
But if you're Bob

27:39.258 --> 27:40.860
and you only have 12 cars
in your fleet,

27:40.893 --> 27:42.862
you might want to know
where they are at all times.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.798
Hey. It's Marks.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.935
I think we got a lead
on our suspect.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.775
(bird calling)

27:58.544 --> 28:00.512
Thank God there wasn't an alarm.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.314
Why do you think
I cut the phone line?

28:02.348 --> 28:03.515
So I couldn't call for help.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.484
Yeah, that, too.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.153
All right,
I guess I'll make us a fire.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.155
Give us some warmth.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.857
I'll see if I can get some food.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.725
Whoa. In the kitchen?
Where the knives live?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.861
I don't think so.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.896
Just sit right there.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.700
(Doug sniffing, panting)

28:21.734 --> 28:25.571
You remember you and me
and that place in the Poconos?

28:25.604 --> 28:28.407
-Was it our second anniversary?
-Fourth.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.209
Don't forget
to open the flue this time.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.679
The cleaning fee was almost
as much as the cabin rental.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.883
-Smelled like smoke for a week.
-Yeah.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.752
Bunch of hick firefighters
laughing at the city kid.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.187
I'm trying to impress my wife,

28:41.220 --> 28:42.488
and they're down there
flirting with her.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.724
What is it with women?

28:45.758 --> 28:48.294
They get all weak-kneed
over a man in uniform.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.930
I don't know.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.200
I married a guy
who wears surgical scrubs.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.701
(chuckles)

28:55.734 --> 28:58.537
Yeah, I guess
I'm a man in uniform, too, huh?

28:58.570 --> 29:01.073
(sighs)

29:02.741 --> 29:04.676
(knock on door)

29:06.145 --> 29:07.780
Good evening, ma'am.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.049
Hello, Officer.
How can I help you?

29:10.082 --> 29:12.051
Uh, one of your neighbors
called us.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.120
Said they heard some yelling,
some sounds of a fight.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.722
Thought there might been some
kind of altercation going on.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.792
It must have been a mistake,
'cause everything's fine here.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.262
It's a warm night for a sweater.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.966
Yeah, I-I don't know who
would have called you, but...

29:26.999 --> 29:29.168
everything's fine.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.639
Ma'am, if you're
in some kind of danger...

29:33.672 --> 29:35.507
DOUG:
Hey, babe, everything okay?

29:36.508 --> 29:39.678
Officer. What's going on?

29:39.711 --> 29:41.914
Uh, we just had some reports
about, um...

29:41.948 --> 29:43.682
some cars being broken into
in the neighborhood.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.018
I just wanted to check and see
if you folks might have seen

29:46.052 --> 29:47.619
-or heard anything.
-Oh, man, that's terrible.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.321
MADDIE:
Yeah, I was just saying that we,

29:49.355 --> 29:51.991
-um, we didn't hear anything.
-DOUG: Yeah.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.861
Well, thank you for your time.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.263
Of course.
You have a good one, Officer.

29:57.296 --> 30:02.134
Oh, uh, I just need you
to sign this right here to prove

30:02.168 --> 30:03.870
I did a thorough canvass.

30:03.903 --> 30:07.173
Look, I get you're scared
of what he'll do

30:07.206 --> 30:09.341
if you report him,
but you need to think

30:09.375 --> 30:11.010
about what he's gonna do
if you don't.

30:11.043 --> 30:14.113
Okay? Don't be afraid to run.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.815
Be afraid to stay.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.590
DOUG:
We can be happy again.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.793
A fresh start in a new place.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.897
New names.
We can become new people.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.801
All right, not just to
the world, but to each other.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.505
And you'll forgive me
and love me again. I know it.

30:48.414 --> 30:51.250
Yeah.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.020
I always found a way
to forgive you.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.092
So we try again.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.028
Start right now.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.695
-(Doug groans)
-(Maddie gasping)

31:03.729 --> 31:05.731
Oh, my God.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.537
(whimpering)

31:14.540 --> 31:16.008
Maddie!

31:16.042 --> 31:17.443
-(gunshot)
-(screams)

31:18.945 --> 31:20.246
Maddie!

31:36.062 --> 31:38.264
I'm such an idiot.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.399
I'm the one
who put her in danger.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.301
Stop it.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.937
He was playing me
this whole time.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.905
(deep inhale)

31:46.939 --> 31:49.275
How could I not see it?

31:49.308 --> 31:52.378
Because psychopaths
don't generally

31:52.411 --> 31:55.081
announce
that they're psychopaths.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.186
He's gonna kill her, isn't he?

32:05.491 --> 32:07.859
I don't know.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.599
(panting)

32:32.618 --> 32:33.952
(grunts)

32:34.987 --> 32:36.989
(birds cawing)

32:38.157 --> 32:40.792
(grunts, panting)

32:40.826 --> 32:42.961
(panting)

32:43.996 --> 32:46.665
Maddie! Maddie!

32:47.666 --> 32:49.735
You can't keep running!

32:56.808 --> 32:58.777
You can't run forever!

32:58.810 --> 33:00.779
(panting)

33:00.812 --> 33:02.881
Maddie!

33:02.914 --> 33:05.151
(echoing):
You can't run forever.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.057
(panting)

33:15.194 --> 33:16.662
(panting)

33:16.695 --> 33:18.197
Maddie!

33:18.230 --> 33:19.898
(siren wailing)

33:19.931 --> 33:21.567
OFFICER (over radio):
We found the rental car.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.669
No sign of the suspect
or the victim.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.238
MARKS:
We found the kidnapper's
abandoned vehicle nearby,

33:26.272 --> 33:28.174
so we're looking for a couple.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.808
They, uh, may have
come in earlier

33:29.841 --> 33:31.343
looking
for a last-minute rental.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.212
No, it's been quiet today.
Nobody's come in.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.414
Are these all the properties
that you manage?

33:35.447 --> 33:37.649
Uh, no, those are
just the ones we highlight.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.318
There's a... a magazine inside.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.019
It has all the listings.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.688
-Um, how many do you manage?
-300.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.199
(panting)

34:02.241 --> 34:03.875
You backtracking bitch.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.911
-(Maddie yells)
-(Doug grunts)

34:09.081 --> 34:11.783
(yelps, screams)

34:13.452 --> 34:15.254
(gun clicking)

34:15.287 --> 34:16.488
(sighs)

34:21.493 --> 34:23.562
I'm not running.
(grunts)

34:23.595 --> 34:25.631
(panting)

34:25.664 --> 34:28.367
(shouts, groaning)

34:28.400 --> 34:30.068
(screams)
No!

34:30.102 --> 34:31.470
(screams)

34:31.503 --> 34:33.939
(panting)

34:35.141 --> 34:37.109

34:37.143 --> 34:40.078

34:56.995 --> 34:59.265
(shouts, groaning)

35:01.967 --> 35:03.635

35:06.472 --> 35:09.141

-(Doug coughs)

35:17.015 --> 35:18.984
(gurgles)

35:19.017 --> 35:20.319
(coughing)

35:26.625 --> 35:29.027
(birds cawing)

35:34.065 --> 35:36.067
*

35:37.536 --> 35:40.506
(indistinct police
radio transmission)

35:40.539 --> 35:43.209
Thank you... Officer.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.076
Thank you.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.516
DOUG:
You don't have to lie to me.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.819
I know what he said.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.855
What they all say.

35:56.888 --> 36:00.226
They want you to leave me.

36:00.259 --> 36:03.061
But they don't understand
that that can never happen.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.299
We're meant to be together.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.401
To live together,

36:09.435 --> 36:12.871
to grow old together
and die together.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.309
That's...

36:17.343 --> 36:20.412
that's how this story ends.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.718
(inhales)

(crying)

36:38.897 --> 36:40.899

36:43.735 --> 36:45.737
No.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.940
No.

MARKS:
Local sheriff got a report
of gunshots.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.900
They followed up.
Found this.

37:14.933 --> 37:19.438
Yeah, rental manager says
all the lake cabins are vacant.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.707
Well, somebody's been here,

37:21.740 --> 37:24.209
and they left in a hurry.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.244
(exhales)

37:26.278 --> 37:29.114
It's got to be them, right?

37:29.147 --> 37:30.716
Question now is,

37:30.749 --> 37:32.751
which way did they go?

37:32.784 --> 37:36.054
(sighs)
If she's out there and...

37:36.087 --> 37:38.056
and she's hurt...

37:38.089 --> 37:39.725
They're sending more officers.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.427
Search and rescue's on its way.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.928
Choppers, dogs.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.496
It's gonna be
a full-court press.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.998
SHERIFF:
I got blood out here!

37:49.635 --> 37:52.938
Maddie! Maddie!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.662
Maddie!

38:16.695 --> 38:18.764
-Buck?
-Maddie!

38:18.797 --> 38:20.332
Buck?

38:20.366 --> 38:21.533
(pants)
Maddie.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.201
-(sobs): Buck!

38:23.234 --> 38:25.837
-(sobbing)
-Hey. Hey, hey.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.673
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
(panting)

38:27.706 --> 38:29.641
I'm here. I'm here.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.309
(sobs)
I didn't give up.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.211
(crying)

38:33.244 --> 38:35.714
I... I didn't give up.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.148
(sobs):
I...

38:37.182 --> 38:40.151
-(panting)
-(Athena speaking indistinctly)

38:40.185 --> 38:43.321
You did so good.

38:43.355 --> 38:47.325
(helicopter blades whirring)

38:52.330 --> 38:55.367
Never seen red snow before.
(exhales)

38:57.102 --> 38:59.671
It's a miracle
she made it out alive.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.473
No. No miracle here.

39:01.507 --> 39:04.576
That woman fought like hell.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.612
(siren wailing)

39:19.725 --> 39:21.893
BUCK:
Almost there.
You're doing great.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.363
(weakly):
Tired.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.600
Uh, hey, hey, Maddie,
I-I know...

39:28.634 --> 39:30.402
I know you're tired,
but I-I need you

39:30.436 --> 39:32.404
to keep your eyes open for me.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.105
Yeah, you-you know the drill.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.407
Uh-huh.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.576
Yeah, just, uh...
just like that.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.578
(sniffles)
Hey, you, uh... you think

39:39.611 --> 39:41.179
you had a hard day.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.182
Athena and I have been running
all over the state

39:44.215 --> 39:45.350
looking for you.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.952
I wasn't dressed for snow.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.387
-Me, either.
-(chuckles)

39:49.421 --> 39:52.223
(sniffles)
Athena said she'd, uh...

39:52.257 --> 39:54.225
she'd call Bobby,

39:54.259 --> 39:56.628
let everyone know
that you're okay.

39:56.662 --> 40:00.231
They are gonna be...
so relieved.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.733
Chimney.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.969
Chimney most of all.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.740
Chimney's alive?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.308
Oh, my God. Y...

40:10.341 --> 40:12.310
Maddie, no, yeah,
Ch-Chimney's alive.

40:12.343 --> 40:14.480
He, uh...
(chuckles)

40:14.513 --> 40:16.114
He-he made it through.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.416
(shudders)

40:18.450 --> 40:20.819
You both did.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.153
(sniffles)

40:22.187 --> 40:23.822
(shudders)

40:23.855 --> 40:26.224
* When the rain is blowing *

40:26.257 --> 40:29.461
* In your face *

40:29.495 --> 40:32.263
* And the whole world *

40:32.297 --> 40:35.667
* Is on your case *

40:35.701 --> 40:38.470
* I could offer you... *

40:38.504 --> 40:40.472
How are we doing, Mr. Han?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.407
Ready to get out of here.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.576
Three days
after major abdominal surgery?

40:44.610 --> 40:46.411
You might want to pace yourself.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.646
I'm gonna start pacing myself

40:47.679 --> 40:50.482
up and down these walls
pretty soon.

40:50.516 --> 40:53.218
Well, maybe...
your friend can distract you.

40:55.621 --> 40:58.857
* And there is no one there
to dry your tears... *

40:58.890 --> 41:00.492
(chuckles)

41:00.526 --> 41:01.960
What are you doing here?

41:01.993 --> 41:03.829
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

41:05.363 --> 41:07.398
I am in the hospital.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.468
I got myself transferred.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.037
(exhales)

41:12.070 --> 41:13.171
No, no, no...

41:13.204 --> 41:15.507
No.

41:15.541 --> 41:19.545
All this is... gonna heal.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.513
I'm gonna be okay.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.949
* But I would never
do you wrong... *

41:23.982 --> 41:25.984
How are you feeling?

41:27.553 --> 41:29.287
Starting to hate hospitals.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.956
(both chuckle)

41:30.989 --> 41:33.191
But this is much better
than rebar.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.527
No coma, so...

41:35.561 --> 41:37.128
(Chimney inhales sharply)

41:37.162 --> 41:40.031
I thought...
(exhales)

41:40.065 --> 41:42.133
I really thought that...

41:42.167 --> 41:44.035
Me, too.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.303
(chuckles)

41:45.336 --> 41:47.573
-You're okay.
-(sniffles)

41:47.606 --> 41:49.808
* I'd go crawling
down the avenue *

41:49.841 --> 41:52.644
We're okay.
(sniffles)

41:52.678 --> 41:57.048
* No, there's nothing
that I wouldn't do *

41:58.116 --> 42:00.418
* To make you feel *

42:00.451 --> 42:03.254
* My love. *

I took the thing
that you value most,

43:42.187 --> 43:44.389
and I toyed with it
for my own entertainment.
