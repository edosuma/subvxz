00:31.465 --> 00:32.964
Mmm, ah!

00:32.966 --> 00:35.400
Beastie made us a cabbage,
garlic and onions stew.

00:35.402 --> 00:38.870
Ooh, that sounds like
a dangerous combination

00:55.022 --> 00:56.555
Your breath is toxic, Titans.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.024
-You need to brush now!
-Okay.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.634

01:21.481 --> 01:23.548
There are brushes
for our tooths?

01:23.550 --> 01:26.651
Beats me. I didn't know
teeth had hair on 'em
until just now.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.453
Teeth do not have hair!

01:28.455 --> 01:31.323
Brushing your teeth
is the cornerstone
of good oral hygiene.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.857
Good? Good?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.393
Oral Hygiene

01:37.297 --> 01:39.331

01:46.073 --> 01:49.341
And you say he was just good!

02:08.362 --> 02:09.761
Disgusting!

02:10.463 --> 02:11.830
What do we have here?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.298
BEAST BOY: Ow! Ow!

02:13.300 --> 02:14.833
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:14.835 --> 02:17.335
-Stop it!
-Your tooth has a cavity.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.870
It needs to be removed.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.139
Uh-uh, no way!
I loves all my teeth!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.941
If we don't remove
that tooth, Beast Boy,

02:22.943 --> 02:26.244
it will get infected
and you will die!

02:26.246 --> 02:27.345
Die!

02:27.347 --> 02:28.413
So?

02:28.415 --> 02:29.981
Let me explain it to him.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.150
Dude, you gotta pop that
toothie-tooth outta your face

02:32.152 --> 02:34.986
so you can get some
of that good money
from the tooth fairy.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.922
I'm not trading my tooth
for a couple of dirty nickels.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.324
Bro, didn't you hear?

02:39.326 --> 02:41.726
The tooth fairy's got
that paper money now.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.794
Paper money?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.562
She can have all my teeths.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.564
The tooth fairy? I don't know.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.868
Anyone who sneaks
into your room at night
and collects teeth is a creep.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.737
I always thought the fairy
of tooths was sweet.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.172
Ah, of course you did.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.307
She collects teeth, Starfire,
think about it.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.376
<i>What is she even doing</i>
<i>with all these teeth?</i>

02:58.378 --> 02:59.611
Normal things...

02:59.613 --> 03:02.580
Like, uh, wearing them
as jewelry.

03:02.582 --> 03:03.948

CYBORG: <i> Maybe she doesn't have</i>

RAVEN: <i> That's even worse.</i>

03:08.889 --> 03:10.455
STARFIRE: <i> I believe she</i>
<i>dresses the teeth up</i>

03:10.457 --> 03:13.625

<i>as little toys.</i>

03:13.627 --> 03:15.427
-(SHUDDERS)
-Come on, Raven.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.495
You never put a tooth
under your pillow
when you were a kid?

03:17.497 --> 03:19.464
Uh, no. No, I didn't.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.066
That's like putting
your hair or toe nails
under your pillow for money.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.234
And I don't do
business with creeps.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.402
Well, I do.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.538

04:22.462 --> 04:24.496

You've been intentionally
loosing teeth to get money
from the tooth fairy.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.700
-So?
-You don't have a problem

04:39.112 --> 04:41.312
I didn't get a stack like that
for my baby teeth.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.015
That's 'cause she pays more
for permanent teeth.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.984
All of my teeth are permanent.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.520
Well, they won't make you

are your source of dignity.
