16:44.336 --> 16:45.504
{\an3}Well, cool.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.215
I'm about to do
the loud thing.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.299
{\an3}Yeah.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.510
{\an3}Oh, dishes.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.803
{\an3}Hmm.

16:52.886 --> 16:53.512
{\an3}[chuckles]

16:53.595 --> 16:55.472
{\an3}Spoon!

16:56.473 --> 16:57.224
{\an3}Spoon!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.644
{\an3}Spoon!

17:01.478 --> 17:02.938
{\an3}Knife!

17:03.021 --> 17:04.772
{\an3}Fork!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.275
{\an3}Baby fork!

17:06.358 --> 17:09.111
- Those were all dirty.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.404
{\an3}- Really?

17:10.487 --> 17:13.073
{\an3}I'll just have to
clean them all.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.910
{\an1}- Would you
knock it off?

17:16.993 --> 17:20.455
{\an3}- Oh, well, welcome back,
Loud Lolli.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.001
{\an1}- I may be loud, but at least
I've always had your back.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.462
{\an3}- Babe,
you watched the video.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.796
{\an3}You admitted
to being wrong.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.299
{\an1}- That's when I need
your support the most.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.634
{\an1}That's when you should be
doubling down.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.677
{\an3}- Come on.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.054
{\an3}You're being
a little unreasonable.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.723
- I've done it for you.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.974
- What are you
talking about?

17:39.057 --> 17:41.643
{\an1}- I'm talking about
your ninth album.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.481
{\an1}Your double-disc
"hip-hopera."

17:45.564 --> 17:47.941
- "Boyce Don't Cry?"

17:48.025 --> 17:50.694
{\an1}- "Rolling Stone" magazine
gave it a half a star.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.822
{\an3}- You know what, I don't
write my music for the critics.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.115
The public loved it.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.159
{\an3}You saw all those reviews
on Amazon.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.828
{\an1}- Oh, you mean from, uh,
SoulFanPhilly...

17:59.912 --> 18:02.164
- Mm-hmm.
- Crystal from San Antonio,

18:02.247 --> 18:04.792
BigKenny45.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.336
That was all me.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.964
- Wait a minute,
you were BigKenny45?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.257
- Yes, I was.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.258
{\an1}- [sighs]

18:13.342 --> 18:15.969
{\an3}- I created 75 accounts,
Boyce,

18:16.053 --> 18:19.848
{\an3}so I could write you
75 great reviews.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.141
{\an1}- Damn.

18:21.225 --> 18:25.479
{\an1}In my mind, Big Kenny
wore that album out, man.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.816
{\an1}So, baby, you--you lied to me
to make me feel better?

18:28.899 --> 18:30.567
{\an3}- Exactly!

18:30.651 --> 18:33.821
{\an1}- So how is that any different
than what I did for you?

18:33.904 --> 18:36.573
- Oh, that's so different!

18:36.657 --> 18:38.200
We--because...

18:38.283 --> 18:40.828
{\an3}Ca--okay--it--
my intention

18:40.911 --> 18:43.455
{\an3}was to--oh--
listen.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.623
{\an3}When you really
think about it...

18:44.706 --> 18:47.125
{\an1}- Mm-hmm.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.710
{\an3}- [sighs]
When you really

18:48.794 --> 18:52.381
{\an3}think about it, Boyce,
why would we lie to each other

18:52.464 --> 18:54.716
about something like this?

18:54.800 --> 18:55.968
{\an1}- Because we love
each other.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.469
- Yes.
- Come here, babe.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.557
{\an3}- I love you, and thank you
for having my back.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.226
{\an3}Now let's go upstairs
and get loud.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.895
- [chuckles]

19:06.979 --> 19:10.774
You know what, let me get
a baby fork real quick.
