02:53.472 --> 02:54.607
Hello?

03:02.414 --> 03:03.683
Hello?

03:10.389 --> 03:11.957
Is anyone there?

03:51.597 --> 03:52.765
Record heat continues

03:52.798 --> 03:54.066
for its fifth straight day

03:54.099 --> 03:55.768
throughout the five boroughs.

03:55.801 --> 03:57.870
Several deaths
have already been reported

03:57.903 --> 04:00.673
with no indication
of when relief might come.

04:00.706 --> 04:03.075
The health department recommends
to drink plenty of fluids

04:03.108 --> 04:06.746
and stay inside or under shade
as much as possible.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.547
Returning to our lead story
this morning,

04:08.580 --> 04:11.417
the .44 caliber killer
has struck again,

04:11.450 --> 04:12.952
this time in the Bronx.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.754
The victim,
an unidentified brunette,

04:14.787 --> 04:16.956
has been confirmed
to fit the killer's pattern

04:16.988 --> 04:19.625
of targeting women
with long dark hair,

04:19.658 --> 04:23.662
shot at close range on
the sidewalk or in parked cars.

04:23.695 --> 04:26.165
In a chilling letter released
by police from the killer,

04:26.198 --> 04:29.969
he wrote, "I am still here like
a spirit roaming the night,

04:30.002 --> 04:33.406
thirsty, hungry,
seldom stopping to rest,

04:33.439 --> 04:35.541
and I will see you
at the next job."

04:35.574 --> 04:38.644
"In their blood and from
the gutter." Sam's cre...

05:13.011 --> 05:14.713
For fuck's sake.

05:25.557 --> 05:27.927
- Leave that ball.
- Crazy out here.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.161
Hey there, man! What do you...

05:33.832 --> 05:35.802
Okay, I'm coming down there.

06:41.266 --> 06:42.935
Where's my family
supposed to go?

06:42.968 --> 06:44.537
- It's not my problem.
- I'll have your money.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.572
- By the end of the week.
- That's too late.

06:46.605 --> 06:47.740
Where you going with my stuff?

06:47.773 --> 06:49.108
Hey, move it!

07:26.211 --> 07:28.214
See you later.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.120
Hello?

08:08.153 --> 08:10.756
- Margo?
- June?

08:13.792 --> 08:15.995
Are you okay?

08:16.028 --> 08:18.331
Ye... yeah. I'm... I'm fine.
I, uh...

08:20.432 --> 08:23.168
You don't sound okay.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.170
It's just...

08:25.203 --> 08:28.807
I'm sorry
I've been out of touch.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.744
It's great to hear your voice.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.417
Yours, too.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.019
Where are you?

08:41.453 --> 08:43.255
My grandmother's.

08:43.288 --> 08:44.289
What?

08:46.291 --> 08:49.028
I thought that was just
supposed to be temporary.

08:53.398 --> 08:57.936
Yeah, well, um, I guess I'm in
a bit of a tight spot right now

08:57.969 --> 09:02.842
and... yeah, I, I was wondering
if, maybe, you could, uh...

09:05.077 --> 09:08.047
if you could... see clear

09:08.080 --> 09:10.749
to lend me a bit more money?

09:10.782 --> 09:13.152
Just, just till
the end of the month.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.256
Mm...

09:17.289 --> 09:21.093
Well, how about
I come on the train tomorrow?

09:21.126 --> 09:23.462
I'll bring what I can.

09:23.495 --> 09:27.066
C... come here? No, no! You...

09:27.099 --> 09:30.136
I... it's not a good time.
I'm, um...

09:33.438 --> 09:34.940
Listen, I, um...

09:36.842 --> 09:40.846
Couldn't you just... You could
mail some, like you did before.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.115
Don't be ridiculous.
I... I really miss you.

09:43.148 --> 09:44.783
I want to see you.

09:44.816 --> 09:47.119
Yeah, but... but it's not
a good time, Margo.

09:47.152 --> 09:50.322
I, I'm very busy
and I won't be here.

09:50.355 --> 09:52.324
Who are you kidding?

09:52.357 --> 09:54.159
I'll catch the 11 o'clock.

09:54.192 --> 09:55.761
- And be there by the afternoon.
- No!

09:55.794 --> 09:58.297
Wait, Margo. I said no!

09:58.330 --> 10:00.099
It'll be great.

10:57.489 --> 11:00.025
Oh, shit! Ah!

11:23.949 --> 11:25.250
...firing back
today against

11:25.283 --> 11:27.586
suspicious accusations
earlier this month

11:27.619 --> 11:29.555
that the city's
antiquated electrical...

11:53.612 --> 11:55.414
Leave me the fuck alone!

12:34.452 --> 12:36.288
Where's the usual kid?

12:36.321 --> 12:40.525
Uh, he... he ain't around
no more. I'm Freddie.

12:40.558 --> 12:43.462
You realize you're more
than four hours late.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.130
I mean, yeah,
I mean, with this heat,

12:45.163 --> 12:47.432
it's been slow-going.
So, you know...

12:47.465 --> 12:50.335
Do you have any idea how
inconsiderate it is to be late?

12:50.368 --> 12:53.372
Late with food?
Make people wait for food?

12:57.342 --> 13:00.145
Hey, look. Look, lady. Lady.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.049
- Don't call me lady.
- Listen.

13:04.082 --> 13:05.918
- We... we just been backed...
- Don't call me lady.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.920
Well, what's your name, then?

13:09.621 --> 13:13.458
June. How much do I owe you?

13:13.491 --> 13:16.962
16.70.
I can bring these in for you.

13:16.995 --> 13:20.900
No, no, no. Just stay there.
Don't come in.

13:31.676 --> 13:32.978
Hey!

13:36.147 --> 13:39.184
- You got anything smaller?
- Don't they give you change?

13:39.217 --> 13:41.921
This neighborhood? Serious?

13:46.758 --> 13:48.494
Just keep the change.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.431
What you want me to do
with the bags?

13:52.464 --> 13:54.133
Here, I'll take them.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.141
Alright, um, thanks for the tip.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.310
Hey!

14:05.710 --> 14:07.680
Have you been ringing my buzzer?

14:09.481 --> 14:13.285
I mean, yeah,
you just buzzed me up here.

14:13.318 --> 14:16.522
No, I mean, from before.
Earlier.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.259
Why would I do that?

14:22.694 --> 14:24.229
Yeah, okay.

14:25.463 --> 14:27.266
Thanks for the tip.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.170
Wait, just a sec.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.477
Can you take these down for me?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.414
- Five bucks.
- What?

14:42.447 --> 14:44.716
I just gave you
a three-dollar tip.

14:44.749 --> 14:47.519
- Yeah, but that garbage stinks.
- I'll give you two.

14:47.552 --> 14:49.021
Three.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.059
And let me use your sink.

14:54.092 --> 14:57.562
- My sink?
- Yeah. It's brutal out there.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.197
Enrique ain't got
so much as a fart

14:59.230 --> 15:01.433
blowing through that bodega,
so, shit...

15:19.217 --> 15:21.687
Hey, yo. Thanks.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.291
Can't stand
being dirty.

15:38.803 --> 15:40.773
Hey, thanks.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.275
Yeah, you welcome.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.376
What's up, man.
How you been, yo?

16:34.592 --> 16:36.395
What the hell?

16:39.631 --> 16:41.733
Oh, goddamn it!

16:44.235 --> 16:46.838
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's June.

16:46.871 --> 16:51.376
- <i>Si, senora.</i>
- I just had a delivery today.

16:51.409 --> 16:52.677
Okay.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.646
Your new kid just dropped it off

16:54.679 --> 16:57.482
and, uh, my cigarettes
weren't in the bag.

16:57.515 --> 16:59.885
Are you sure?

16:59.918 --> 17:02.754
Yeah, I paid for them.
The whole carton.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.556
- Masterson Lights.
- Okay, <i>senora.</i>

17:04.589 --> 17:06.724
I... I'm gonna make sure
you get them. Okay?

17:08.526 --> 17:10.262
- Soon?
- Yeah, pronto, pronto.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.232
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

17:27.912 --> 17:29.781
Two men
are under arrest on suspicion

17:29.814 --> 17:31.750
of arson and murder
in the Bronx suburb club firing

17:31.783 --> 17:34.252
that killed 25 persons
in October.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.688
They will appear in criminal
court on Tuesday in Manhattan

17:36.721 --> 17:38.924
where prosecutors are
anticipating a quick hearing

17:38.957 --> 17:40.926
and motion to trial.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.694
I would
just like to say that

17:42.727 --> 17:45.931
the investigation is continuing
in full force in Brooklyn.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.433
Uh, according to witnesses
that we talked to

17:48.466 --> 17:51.236
over the past,
you know, 24 hours,

17:51.269 --> 17:55.307
uh, he's a male,
a white male, 25 to 35.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.643
Approximately 5'7 to 5'10...

17:59.277 --> 18:00.579
Hm...

18:15.360 --> 18:16.962
Hello? Freddie?

18:32.443 --> 18:34.913
I'm calling the cops,
you motherfuckers!

18:41.753 --> 18:43.388
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

18:43.421 --> 18:46.524
Uh, y... yes, hello,
um, you know, it's, um...

18:46.557 --> 18:47.926
What's your emergency, ma'am?

18:47.959 --> 18:50.428
Emergency?

18:50.461 --> 18:52.430
- Ma'am?
- I... I just wanted...

18:56.501 --> 18:58.837
I'd like to report
a disturbance.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.706
What kind of disturbance?

19:04.008 --> 19:05.344
Ma'am?

19:30.935 --> 19:32.504
The most recent
victim was killed

19:32.537 --> 19:34.339
inside a parked car
in the South Bronx,

19:34.372 --> 19:36.741
near an apartment building
where a young man witnessed

19:36.774 --> 19:40.712
the aftermath of the crime
from his fourth-story window.

19:40.745 --> 19:43.648
I heard some shots,
when I ran over,

19:43.681 --> 19:45.784
there was blood
all over the pavement.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.052
Following the latest shooting,

19:47.085 --> 19:48.787
a new letter was received
by police

19:48.820 --> 19:50.889
further taunting them
over the killings

19:50.922 --> 19:53.358
and promising more bloodshed.

19:53.391 --> 19:55.794
In what has now become
a cryptic calling card,

19:55.827 --> 19:58.396
the killer began his letter
with a greeting.

19:58.429 --> 20:00.665
"Hello from the gutters
of New York."

20:22.820 --> 20:24.790
What do you
mean you can't let me in?

20:27.692 --> 20:30.996
Are you out of your mind?
I mean, more than usual?

20:33.464 --> 20:35.400
You're being ridiculous.

20:41.672 --> 20:44.943
Look, whatever it is, it's okay.

20:47.044 --> 20:48.547
No judgments.

21:25.216 --> 21:26.952
My God, June.

21:36.961 --> 21:39.731
How long has it been
since you left here?

22:00.785 --> 22:03.188
Why didn't you tell me
things had gotten so bad?

22:25.142 --> 22:27.078
I could have helped.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.860
I keep expecting
to find a dead body.

23:15.893 --> 23:19.064
Oh, yeah...
Well, it wouldn't surprise me.

23:56.934 --> 23:58.703
Throw that out.

23:58.736 --> 24:00.705
It's a first edition.

24:00.738 --> 24:02.574
Yeah, well...

24:02.607 --> 24:03.775
Here...

24:07.211 --> 24:08.680
I have more.

24:09.814 --> 24:11.583
Get rid of them.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.184
- All of them.
- What?

24:15.186 --> 24:17.122
These are actually important
to keep.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.359
Why?

24:21.392 --> 24:25.196
You wanna purge me
of my stuff... so do it.

24:27.398 --> 24:28.900
Purge away.

25:18.215 --> 25:21.953
Let's take a break.
Get some things for dinner.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.326
Come on.

25:28.359 --> 25:30.695
Let's get out of here.

25:30.728 --> 25:33.031
We can go downtown,
catch a show.

25:39.036 --> 25:40.405
You can, June.

25:41.972 --> 25:43.975
This thing...

25:45.443 --> 25:47.712
it's all in your head.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.783
Ridiculous.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.885
Better be up
by the time I get back.

27:22.439 --> 27:23.808
No.

27:25.109 --> 27:27.311
I know.

27:27.344 --> 27:30.014
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you this.

27:31.882 --> 27:33.918
Jane, she's sick.

27:44.061 --> 27:45.497
Love you, too.

28:25.469 --> 28:29.407
I can't even, I can't...
But these...

28:36.380 --> 28:38.149
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

28:38.182 --> 28:40.117
Do you remember the look
on their faces?

28:40.150 --> 28:43.287
You, you were
a fucking lunatic!

28:58.903 --> 29:02.139
Why didn't you tell me
you were still here...

29:02.172 --> 29:03.608
like this?

29:09.013 --> 29:13.517
Well, I guess,
after everything that happened,

29:13.550 --> 29:14.886
I...

29:16.587 --> 29:20.324
I figured
this was a safe place.

29:25.663 --> 29:27.198
Safe?

29:29.967 --> 29:32.603
Half of the buildings
around here are burned down.

29:32.636 --> 29:36.608
I know your grandmother
made this a sanctuary for you...

29:38.142 --> 29:39.878
but that's changed.

29:41.645 --> 29:44.282
I mean, this place is a...

29:46.717 --> 29:48.386
time bomb.

29:54.391 --> 29:58.629
It's not okay
you continuing like this.

29:58.662 --> 30:02.333
Um, and what do you suggest,
Margo?

30:03.534 --> 30:05.236
Hm?

30:07.037 --> 30:08.539
I mean, what is it?

30:08.572 --> 30:11.409
This magical solution

30:11.442 --> 30:14.145
you seem to have
all figured out for me.

30:14.178 --> 30:18.249
I'm sorry about what happened.
I really am.

30:20.150 --> 30:23.054
But you have to get back up
and fight.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.588
What do you know about that?

30:24.621 --> 30:27.425
You think because I left
the city, I gave up my work?

30:31.428 --> 30:36.033
I... I never tried to play
the game the way you did.

30:36.066 --> 30:37.468
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

30:37.501 --> 30:38.703
Are you kidding me?

30:38.736 --> 30:40.738
Do you have any idea
what it was like

30:40.771 --> 30:44.475
watching those obsequious fucks

30:44.508 --> 30:47.611
praising you ad nauseam?

30:47.644 --> 30:50.348
People who probably never even
read a word of your work.

30:52.182 --> 30:53.351
Do you remember
what you said to me

30:53.384 --> 30:55.286
when my first reviews came out?

30:55.319 --> 30:58.456
My proximity to you

30:58.489 --> 31:01.759
negated the chance
of my ever being a success.

31:01.792 --> 31:05.129
Don't give me that shit.
I supported you.

31:05.162 --> 31:06.998
I went
to every one of your shows.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.633
I... I... I paid your rent!
I... I even...

31:16.507 --> 31:18.009
What is it?

31:20.544 --> 31:22.380
Don't answer it.

31:25.182 --> 31:27.184
Are you in some sort of trouble?

31:27.217 --> 31:31.055
No. It's... it's been happening
like this...

31:31.088 --> 31:32.623
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

31:32.656 --> 31:35.026
Sometimes two, three times
a night.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.695
I go to answer it
and no one's there.

31:37.728 --> 31:39.196
Screw this.
I'm gonna go find out.

31:39.229 --> 31:40.665
No, please, don't.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.645
I can't see anyone.

31:56.613 --> 31:59.784
I... can't see anyone.

32:05.389 --> 32:08.692
Didn't you say a delivery kid
got a look at the place?

32:08.725 --> 32:09.660
Yes, but...

32:11.628 --> 32:14.198
it's something
much more sinister than that.

32:17.668 --> 32:21.372
I don't want you to bug,
but I brought you something.

32:36.787 --> 32:39.323
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a .38.

32:39.356 --> 32:41.692
I don't care what number it is.

32:41.725 --> 32:43.694
I got it
when I was being stalked

32:43.727 --> 32:46.363
by that guy in the Village.

32:46.396 --> 32:47.731
And now that I live
in the sticks,

32:47.764 --> 32:49.567
I don't need it anymore.

32:52.269 --> 32:53.704
It's easy to use.

34:09.478 --> 34:12.583
June, this stuff is...

34:12.616 --> 34:16.487
so f... fucking raw.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.558
I, I can't believe you have it
all just sitting here...

34:21.858 --> 34:24.661
like this,
pages and pages of it.

34:25.795 --> 34:27.764
Uh, you have to finish this.

34:27.797 --> 34:32.503
I... I'll help you
put it together and...

34:37.940 --> 34:41.512
It's, it's absolutely brilliant.

34:48.385 --> 34:50.654
No! June, don't.

34:50.687 --> 34:54.257
Don't do this. Don't.

34:54.291 --> 34:55.626
Why are you doing that?

34:55.659 --> 34:58.262
I know you're taking

34:58.295 --> 35:01.899
some sick satisfaction
in all of this.

35:01.932 --> 35:03.968
- No.
- Coming here...

35:04.001 --> 35:06.804
Seeing me like this.

35:06.837 --> 35:09.440
I don't want your money

35:09.473 --> 35:12.543
and I don't need your pity.

35:12.576 --> 35:14.679
- I want you to go.
- What?

35:21.785 --> 35:22.987
Get out.

36:05.929 --> 36:08.699
An emphatic
wunderkind, June E. Leigh

36:08.732 --> 36:12.870
has been a staunch voice in
the anti-establishment movement.

36:12.903 --> 36:15.472
Countless articles have profiled
her affluent family,

36:15.505 --> 36:18.409
from "Time" to "Harper's,"
as one of the most influential

36:18.442 --> 36:20.844
in America today.
June E. Leigh.

36:22.979 --> 36:24.748
Now, it's widely understood

36:24.781 --> 36:27.651
that even though you presented
your first novel,

36:27.684 --> 36:30.921
simply titled "The Patriarch,"
as a work of fiction,

36:30.954 --> 36:34.825
the main character, uh,
Lawrence Bottinger,

36:34.858 --> 36:36.827
a political manipulator

36:36.860 --> 36:40.497
and, uh, unrepentant
Vietnam War profiteer

36:40.530 --> 36:43.467
and, as you suggest,
a prolific misogynist,

36:43.500 --> 36:46.103
appears, in fact, to be
a thinly-veiled portrait

36:46.136 --> 36:48.372
of your father,
renowned entrepreneur

36:48.405 --> 36:50.541
and philanthropist,
Irving Leigh.

36:50.574 --> 36:53.010
Well, it's
just that, Hans, a character.

36:53.043 --> 36:55.546
Its, uh, publication
and subsequent notoriety

36:55.579 --> 36:57.781
have led
to a criminal investigation

36:57.814 --> 37:00.351
of your father's organizations
and practices.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.420
And it's been said
that your mother and siblings

37:03.453 --> 37:06.724
have disowned you
from the Leigh clan

37:06.757 --> 37:08.926
over this manifesto.

37:08.959 --> 37:12.062
Uh, this
gossipmongering is ridiculous.

37:12.095 --> 37:15.399
If you wanna have a real debate
here, Hans, let's have it.

37:15.432 --> 37:18.369
Uh, people are being clubbed,

37:18.402 --> 37:20.504
f... freaked, zapped and bricked

37:20.537 --> 37:22.373
while
the smug male <i>inteligencia</i>

37:22.406 --> 37:24.742
sit around belittling it all.

37:24.775 --> 37:27.411
You call yourself a patriot,
Sparling?

37:27.444 --> 37:30.147
Rome is burning. Wake up!

37:30.180 --> 37:31.915
I acquiesce!

37:31.948 --> 37:36.553
Now, several members of your own
family have condemned you.

37:36.586 --> 37:38.455
Some have even suggested
that your book has been

37:38.488 --> 37:42.059
the chief contributor
to your father's sudden death.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.034
What did you say?

37:51.067 --> 37:54.405
Your father died
of a heart attack yesterday.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.374
Haven't you seen the papers?

38:36.246 --> 38:37.548
Oh.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.019
Goddamn it, Margo.

38:44.054 --> 38:46.490
Fuck around with my stuff.

39:09.012 --> 39:10.214
Barton And Barton.

39:10.247 --> 39:13.650
Uh, Francesca Bartolometi's
office.

39:13.683 --> 39:15.752
- Please.
- Who's calling?

39:15.785 --> 39:18.555
June. June Leigh.

39:18.588 --> 39:20.924
One moment.

39:20.957 --> 39:22.192
Juni?

39:22.225 --> 39:24.127
Uh, hello, Francesca.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.996
I can't believe
it's you!

39:26.029 --> 39:28.065
I'm wonderful,
of course, sweetie.

39:28.098 --> 39:29.800
- How are you, my dear?
- Uh...

39:29.833 --> 39:32.169
Great. Everything's great.

39:32.202 --> 39:34.204
That's fabulous
to hear.

39:34.237 --> 39:36.707
Juni, we've been trying
to get a hold of you for ages.

39:36.740 --> 39:40.210
I'm, I'm so sorry, Francesca.
I was...

39:40.243 --> 39:44.014
I guess
it's... it's my health. Its...

39:44.047 --> 39:47.651
It's been
really touch and go lately.

39:47.684 --> 39:49.052
I'm sorry
to hear that.

39:49.085 --> 39:52.222
Yeah, in fact, um,
that's why I was calling.

39:52.255 --> 39:56.159
See, um...

39:56.192 --> 40:00.531
I was hoping that maybe...
To see if... i...

40:00.564 --> 40:03.734
If you could, uh,

40:03.767 --> 40:07.037
send me the remainder
of my advance.

40:10.073 --> 40:12.843
June,
in spite of everything

40:12.876 --> 40:15.712
that happened,
you still owe us a book.

40:15.745 --> 40:18.081
I... I know,
i... it's just that I was...

40:18.114 --> 40:19.750
You disappeared.

40:19.783 --> 40:23.253
We gave you the largest advance
ever given to a writer.

40:23.286 --> 40:25.856
- It's been four years.
- I know.

40:25.889 --> 40:27.591
You're one of my favorites,

40:27.624 --> 40:30.727
so it makes it really difficult
for me to say this,

40:30.760 --> 40:34.831
but if you don't deliver
some sort of draft soon,

40:34.864 --> 40:37.034
I will have no choice
but to turn the matter

40:37.067 --> 40:38.602
of repaying us to Accounting.

40:38.635 --> 40:40.604
Yeah, listen, Francesca,

40:40.637 --> 40:42.839
the new work, it's...

40:42.872 --> 40:46.677
It's really coming along
beautifully. Really.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.846
Well, then that's fantastic.
I can't wait.

40:49.879 --> 40:52.316
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

40:52.349 --> 40:54.818
When do we see something?

40:54.851 --> 40:58.155
- One month.
- Okay. <i>Ciao!</i>

43:20.764 --> 43:21.965
Damn it.

43:31.074 --> 43:32.976
Yeah.

43:34.444 --> 43:36.313
Enrique said, uh...

43:36.346 --> 43:39.216
Enrique said sorry
about the mix-up from last time.

43:39.249 --> 43:41.017
It was a mistake,
but he ain't charge you for it.

43:41.050 --> 43:45.522
Yeah, well, I paid for them and
I gave you three extra dollars.

43:45.555 --> 43:47.190
That was a tip.

43:47.223 --> 43:48.892
Wha... Are you kidding me?

43:48.925 --> 43:51.528
You want them or not?

43:51.561 --> 43:52.996
- You're ripping me off.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:53.029 --> 43:55.165
Who said
I tried to steal your smokes?

43:55.198 --> 43:58.001
Are you telling me you didn't?

43:58.034 --> 44:01.104
Look, lady, I may be a hustler,
but I ain't no thief.

44:01.137 --> 44:03.240
And I sure as hell
ain't no liar.

44:24.294 --> 44:25.862
- I said back up, bitch!
- Ow!

44:30.600 --> 44:33.970
Fuckin' savage immortal fools.

44:34.003 --> 44:35.939
Why do you go so close to them?

44:37.006 --> 44:38.242
I've seen you.

44:39.409 --> 44:42.245
You always head right for them.

44:42.278 --> 44:45.282
Fuck them. That's why.

44:45.315 --> 44:49.052
Doesn't sound
very preservationist of you.

44:49.085 --> 44:53.356
Yeah, well, those dudes
are all about anarchy.

44:53.389 --> 44:55.525
They want to tear down
everything they see as good

44:55.558 --> 44:56.927
in this world.

45:02.198 --> 45:04.268
Do you mind my asking?

45:06.536 --> 45:08.305
What happened?

45:10.106 --> 45:12.176
What? My arm?

45:15.345 --> 45:16.980
Building fire.

45:20.016 --> 45:23.353
When I was a little kid, my mom
died trying to pull me out.

45:23.386 --> 45:24.921
They say it was the owners
who did it,

45:24.954 --> 45:26.890
but they could never prove it.

45:33.563 --> 45:36.366
I'm... I'm, I'm sorry.

45:38.935 --> 45:41.538
The world only gives you back
what you give it.

45:45.909 --> 45:49.145
Hey, um, you better be careful.

45:49.178 --> 45:51.014
Those dudes find out
you a crib job,

45:51.047 --> 45:53.150
they gonna do a pushing on you.

45:54.450 --> 45:56.253
What does that mean?

45:56.286 --> 45:58.288
I mean,
who you trying to kid, lady?

45:58.321 --> 46:00.423
You were spooked.

46:45.268 --> 46:46.703
The killer's
eighth attack

46:46.736 --> 46:48.571
in just over 12 months

46:48.604 --> 46:50.373
came on this lonely street
in Brooklyn...

46:56.045 --> 46:59.016
...gasoline tax
if approved by congress...

47:01.751 --> 47:03.586
Much
of the nation is sweating

47:03.619 --> 47:05.622
with temperatures hovering in...

47:07.357 --> 47:08.992
...addict-free
rehabilitation center

47:09.025 --> 47:10.427
has a 24-hour hotline for...

48:36.279 --> 48:39.416
And that's it
for the "Wolf Hour."

48:39.449 --> 48:43.120
See you back here tomorrow.
Same time, same place.

49:23.359 --> 49:26.096
It's the police,
ma'am.

49:36.506 --> 49:39.776
Hi. I'm responding
to a harassment complaint.

49:39.809 --> 49:42.312
You call that in?

49:42.345 --> 49:44.747
Yeah. That was over a week ago.

49:44.780 --> 49:46.716
Lady, it's the worst crime
summer on record,

49:46.749 --> 49:50.386
so we're not exactly working
at full capacity here.

49:50.419 --> 49:52.889
I... I... I'm sorry, officer.
I just...

49:52.922 --> 49:55.425
I wasn't sure
if you were coming.

49:56.425 --> 49:57.627
Come in.

50:07.937 --> 50:09.405
You know, somebody got shot
in the face

50:09.438 --> 50:12.475
three blocks from here
the other night.

50:12.508 --> 50:14.410
You know
what they were fighting over?

50:14.443 --> 50:17.547
A goddamn ice-cream cone.
You fucking believe that?

50:17.580 --> 50:20.850
Goddamn people. Animals.

50:20.883 --> 50:21.852
Um...

50:24.820 --> 50:27.390
Can I make you some coffee?

50:27.423 --> 50:31.128
Yeah. That'd be nice. Thanks.

50:33.796 --> 50:35.932
- Is it just you?
- Yeah.

50:35.965 --> 50:40.270
I used to be with
my grandmother, but she passed.

50:40.303 --> 50:41.838
My condolences.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.342
Thanks.

50:51.414 --> 50:53.583
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please.

50:58.888 --> 51:01.958
Now, why don't you tell me

51:01.991 --> 51:04.394
what's been going on here?

51:04.427 --> 51:07.764
Yeah, well, um, it's kind of
hard to explain, but...

51:07.797 --> 51:09.632
That's alright.

51:09.665 --> 51:11.868
You just take it slow.

51:11.901 --> 51:13.570
I'm here to help you.

51:15.438 --> 51:17.574
Okay, so it's...

51:19.275 --> 51:20.910
It's my buzzer.

51:20.943 --> 51:24.814
See, it's been ringing
over and over...

51:26.449 --> 51:27.483
day and night.

51:27.516 --> 51:28.752
Sometimes...

51:30.519 --> 51:32.388
two, three times a night.

51:32.421 --> 51:35.225
- Your buzzer?
- Yeah. But not like that.

51:35.258 --> 51:38.528
It's like someone's genuinely
trying to intimidate me.

51:38.561 --> 51:39.996
Yeah.

51:40.029 --> 51:43.533
Well, that's,
that's a bit weird.

51:43.566 --> 51:45.602
- And what does this person say?
- Well, that's the point.

51:45.635 --> 51:48.304
They don't say anything.

51:48.337 --> 51:49.506
Huh.

51:52.975 --> 51:53.944
Uh...

51:57.313 --> 51:59.916
You go down to check it out,
you know...

52:00.816 --> 52:01.851
see who it is?

52:01.884 --> 52:03.386
Uh, no.

52:03.419 --> 52:05.589
It's hard for me to go down.

52:08.624 --> 52:10.727
Why, you handicapped?

52:10.760 --> 52:13.329
No. Not like that.

52:13.362 --> 52:16.766
- Look, officer...
- Just Blake.

52:16.799 --> 52:20.970
I realize this isn't the crime
of the century here, Blake.

52:21.003 --> 52:24.874
But it's like someone
is genuinely trying to scare me.

52:24.907 --> 52:26.542
Yeah, it's just that

52:26.575 --> 52:28.511
I'm not sure
that ringing somebody's buzzer

52:28.544 --> 52:29.779
is actually a crime.

52:29.812 --> 52:32.482
Right. But harassment is,
isn't it?

52:32.515 --> 52:36.686
Yeah,
if they said something to you,

52:36.719 --> 52:38.721
if they've threatened you.

52:38.754 --> 52:41.891
- Anything like that happen?
- No. I told you.

52:41.924 --> 52:46.496
Can't you just have someone
swing by from time to time?

52:46.529 --> 52:50.900
You know, discourage them,
whoever it is.

52:50.933 --> 52:52.769
You ain't got an old man
you can send down?

52:52.802 --> 52:54.737
Look, I just want you
to do something

52:54.770 --> 52:56.906
about whoever is harassing me.

53:07.817 --> 53:10.020
I knew a bird like you once.

53:12.922 --> 53:14.991
A lovely bird.

53:15.024 --> 53:16.659
Well, me and this gal,

53:16.692 --> 53:19.662
we had ourselves a nice
little arrangement for a while.

53:19.695 --> 53:21.331
She liked to be alone, too.

53:21.364 --> 53:25.068
Just, you know,
not all the time.

53:26.635 --> 53:29.038
So I'd come by, check on her

53:29.071 --> 53:31.607
and she'd tell me about
all the hippy tree-hugger shit

53:31.640 --> 53:33.509
goin' on in her world,

53:33.542 --> 53:38.014
and I'd give her the pleasure
of, uh, you know, my company.

53:41.751 --> 53:44.454
You could have an arrangement
like that, too, you know?

53:50.760 --> 53:54.897
'Cause things ain't like
they used to be. Right?

53:54.930 --> 53:58.335
No white knight
coming to the rescue.

54:00.970 --> 54:04.741
You peaceniks,
you got one thing right.

54:06.008 --> 54:09.546
This place, this country...

54:11.781 --> 54:13.483
it's changing.

54:17.553 --> 54:19.522
And it ain't for the best.

54:22.458 --> 54:23.726
All units,
fire in progress

54:23.759 --> 54:25.661
in the vicinity
of 400 block of Cortland.

54:25.694 --> 54:26.963
Calling all units.

54:26.996 --> 54:28.798
Arson suspect seen on foot,

54:28.831 --> 54:31.734
heading towards
[indistinct] Avenue.

54:36.539 --> 54:38.474
Call of the wild.

54:49.752 --> 54:52.188
That's a hell of a cup of joe
you make there, June.

54:53.923 --> 54:55.458
Fuck you.

54:58.694 --> 55:01.898
You know
that little bird of mine...

55:01.931 --> 55:04.867
she thought
her shit didn't stink, too.

55:06.902 --> 55:09.939
That her fancy ideas
would save her

55:09.972 --> 55:12.475
when the big bad wolf
came calling.

55:13.175 --> 55:14.677
Fuck you!

55:15.678 --> 55:17.180
Have a nice day.

55:17.213 --> 55:21.117
Hey, fuck you,
you piece of shit!

57:07.756 --> 57:11.160
I consider
myself a reluctant witness.

57:11.193 --> 57:13.563
We as English-speaking Americans

57:13.596 --> 57:17.133
are signatories to a cultural
genocide of the planet.

57:17.166 --> 57:21.270
It has been estimated
that by the year 2100,

57:21.303 --> 57:24.607
nearly half
of the roughly 7000 languages

57:24.640 --> 57:27.143
spoken on Earth
will likely disappear.

57:27.176 --> 57:29.645
Can you not see
where this is heading?

57:29.678 --> 57:33.849
Are we creating
binary or singular systems?

57:33.882 --> 57:37.219
Then the world becomes
literally whack in light.

57:43.125 --> 57:46.896
I consider
myself a reluctant witness.

57:46.929 --> 57:50.900
We as English-speaking Americans
are signatories to a...

57:52.201 --> 57:54.671
cultural genocide
of the planet...

58:24.733 --> 58:26.869
because no matter
which way you slice it...

58:28.370 --> 58:30.773
If you want to understand
the true nature of man,

58:30.806 --> 58:33.209
to totally grasp
how something that fascist

58:33.242 --> 58:36.379
like the holocaust could happen
in modern times...

58:36.412 --> 58:38.214
Sure people shout out about...

58:49.925 --> 58:51.227
Shit!

58:53.896 --> 58:55.031
God...

58:59.468 --> 59:00.737
Damn it.

01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:45.808
Hello?

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:48.211
Uh, yeah.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.847
- Hello.
- Go ahead.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.015
U... um...

01:00:54.983 --> 01:00:57.386
I'd like to have a date.

01:00:57.419 --> 01:01:00.923
- You want a date?
- Yes.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.259
Sex?

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:05.961
What?

01:01:05.994 --> 01:01:07.430
Male or female?

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.027
Who is it?

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.399
Cleaning service.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.936
Cleaning?

01:02:20.969 --> 01:02:22.404
Look, lady,
you gonna keep me

01:02:22.437 --> 01:02:24.006
down here all night?

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.277
Hello?

01:03:06.581 --> 01:03:08.183
Hey.

01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:09.252
Hey.

01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:14.624
What's your name?

01:03:16.992 --> 01:03:18.127
Billy.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.967
You got a lot of locks, lady.

01:04:02.537 --> 01:04:04.473
Nice. It's good.

01:04:04.506 --> 01:04:06.342
You gotta watch out these days.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.477
People are getting nuts
out there in that heat.

01:04:12.147 --> 01:04:16.018
You want something?
S... something to drink?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.455
Got any soda pop?

01:04:34.536 --> 01:04:37.539
You know, I gotta tell you,
I almost squashed this date

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:39.508
after gettin' off the subway.

01:04:41.376 --> 01:04:44.113
Why the hell do you live
up in this 'hood?

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.715
It's like a war zone.

01:04:48.216 --> 01:04:49.618
No soda.

01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:52.287
I... could make us

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.556
some coffee or...

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:56.692
Um, maybe water.

01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:02.631
- Hey!
- Whoa! Hey. Okay.

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:04.333
Hey...

01:05:04.366 --> 01:05:06.068
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:08.170
That might've been a little
screwed-up for me to do.

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:12.107
Sometimes it's just, it's good
to, like, break the ice.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.509
Please leave.

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:20.182
Okay.

01:05:27.522 --> 01:05:28.724
Wait.

01:05:38.667 --> 01:05:40.202
Wait.

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:42.237
- No. That's not necessary.
- No, please.

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:45.441
Lady, just don't worry about it,
alright?

01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:28.417
I've never heard
this kind of music before.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:31.854
It's my grandmother.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:34.823
Really?

01:06:34.856 --> 01:06:37.593
She sounds like
the saddest person in the world.

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.834
This was her place
after the war.

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.470
I used to come up here and visit

01:06:48.503 --> 01:06:49.771
when things got tough.

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:06.222
What's it like out there
for you?

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.431
Ain't like it was
when I first got here.

01:07:16.798 --> 01:07:18.834
Pimps started getting greedy

01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:21.603
and messing up dudes
for not meeting their quotas.

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:24.306
It's why I joined up
with the service you called.

01:07:24.339 --> 01:07:27.309
I had to get away
from that noise.

01:07:27.342 --> 01:07:29.578
You don't live on the streets,
do you?

01:07:30.512 --> 01:07:32.214
Sometimes.

01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:33.649
It's not so bad in the summer.

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.617
Sometimes I crash with friends.

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:39.221
What about your family?
They don't worry about you?

01:07:40.989 --> 01:07:43.292
Mind if I ask you something?

01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:46.828
No.

01:07:46.861 --> 01:07:48.330
Why this?

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.866
- What?
- This.

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:54.303
I mean...

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.338
I guess I don't get
why someone like you

01:07:56.371 --> 01:07:58.240
is calling up midnight cowboys.

01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:00.976
What do you mean?

01:08:01.009 --> 01:08:02.578
Well, don't take this
the wrong way,

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.879
but you don't strike me
as the kind of bird

01:08:03.912 --> 01:08:05.848
who needs to pay for it.

01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:13.889
- I have a condition.
- Like, a disease?

01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:16.358
No. Not like that.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:17.526
It's just...

01:08:21.696 --> 01:08:23.932
I don't like to leave here.

01:08:23.965 --> 01:08:26.635
At all?
You mean, like, you can't?

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:30.339
Just figure,

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.341
if I stay in here,

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:37.312
I won't do anymore damage
out there.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.782
I used to have a fear
kind of like that.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.252
I was an orphan,
you know, adopted.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.957
Got into a lot of trouble
when I was younger.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:51.526
Sent out to my foster uncle's
farm one summer.

01:08:51.559 --> 01:08:52.761
Middle of nowhere.

01:08:52.794 --> 01:08:55.296
We had a small utility shed

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:57.265
in the back of our barn.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:00.669
And one day,
after he was done beating on me,

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:03.372
he dragged me by the hair
and he threw me back there.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.542
It wasn't so bad at first.

01:09:07.575 --> 01:09:09.377
But then I felt them.

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.314
Dozens of spiders

01:09:12.346 --> 01:09:15.384
just crawling out of the hay,

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.685
over my skin.

01:09:16.718 --> 01:09:18.520
They covered me
from head to toe.

01:09:18.553 --> 01:09:20.856
They even crawled in my nose
and my mouth.

01:09:20.889 --> 01:09:23.658
I screamed,
but there was no way out.

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.926
After that, I'd piss my pants

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.497
if those fuckers
even crossed my path.

01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:29.564
Ah...

01:09:39.107 --> 01:09:41.877
How did you manage
to get over it?

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:44.979
I was in a pet shop one summer

01:09:45.013 --> 01:09:46.948
and there it was.

01:09:46.981 --> 01:09:49.017
A black spider sitting there,

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:51.653
looking right at me.

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:54.690
Before I could think,
I just snatched the fucker

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:55.724
and I ate him.

01:09:55.757 --> 01:09:57.059
What?

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.527
Yeah.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.729
- That's crazy.
- It was crazy.

01:10:00.762 --> 01:10:03.632
It was a crazy thing to do.
It was.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.403
What about your family?

01:10:08.436 --> 01:10:10.072
Do you ever see them anymore?

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.473
No.

01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:16.511
It feels weird
that I'm telling you all this.

01:10:16.544 --> 01:10:19.081
I don't really ever tell anyone
nothin' about me.

01:10:51.546 --> 01:10:53.648
You expecting someone?

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:58.787
Lady, you don't got, like,
an old man or anything.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.888
- Do you?
- No.

01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:06.962
Don't go down there.

01:11:06.995 --> 01:11:08.897
- Let me check it out for you.
- No. Please don't.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:23.979
Nothing.

01:11:28.216 --> 01:11:30.652
I think someone
is trying to drive me insane.

01:11:30.685 --> 01:11:33.989
Ah, it's probably just some
'hood rats messing with you.

01:11:34.022 --> 01:11:35.690
Oh...

01:11:35.723 --> 01:11:38.593
A big fat hello

01:11:38.626 --> 01:11:41.864
from the gutters of New York.

01:12:04.752 --> 01:12:08.223
Do you ever think, whoever
it is ringing your buzzer,

01:12:08.256 --> 01:12:10.959
they aren't doing it
to torment you?

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.763
Maybe it's like a calling...

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:16.165
to go outside...

01:12:17.765 --> 01:12:19.034
face your fears.

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:04.205
Come on!

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:13.815
Let's go.

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.157
Barton And Barton.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:31.326
Uh, hello. This is June Leigh.

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:33.094
Um, can you please connect me

01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:35.831
to Francesca Bartolometi's
office?

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.771
Um, Mrs. Bartolometi
is currently unavailable.

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.908
Well, can I...

01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:48.209
If you leave your number,
I'll make sure

01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:50.178
someone gets back to you.

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:52.648
Someone?

01:16:10.164 --> 01:16:12.367
Hey, what the hell
you been living on up here?

01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:15.437
I need your help, Freddie.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:23.145
Can you deliver something
for me?

01:16:26.981 --> 01:16:29.017
- Fifty bucks.
- What?

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.453
I... I didn't even tell you
where it's going.

01:16:33.187 --> 01:16:35.256
- Twenty.
- Forty.

01:16:35.289 --> 01:16:38.026
After the groceries,
I've only got 40 left.

01:16:38.059 --> 01:16:39.160
- Not my problem.
- Okay.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:41.329
So you can use my sink anytime,

01:16:41.362 --> 01:16:42.964
even my bath.

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.301
- Forty.
- Please.

01:16:53.307 --> 01:16:56.344
Look, I see you standing there.

01:16:56.377 --> 01:16:58.379
I mean,
I can tell you're in a bad way,

01:16:58.412 --> 01:17:00.348
that you need
whatever this thing is

01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:01.750
to get where it needs to go

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.985
so you can move forward
with your life.

01:17:04.018 --> 01:17:06.087
You see me,
and I do this for a living.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.323
And you see me,
and you're gonna stand there

01:17:08.356 --> 01:17:10.291
and tell me that this thing
that you need to get done

01:17:10.324 --> 01:17:13.261
isn't worth 40 bucks to you,

01:17:13.294 --> 01:17:15.130
even if it's the last 40 bucks
you have

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:17.032
for the rest of your life?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.837
Have you not learned anything
from looking out from up here?

01:17:51.499 --> 01:17:53.935
Here's the address.

01:17:53.968 --> 01:17:56.504
Make sure they know...

01:17:56.537 --> 01:17:59.274
it's for Francesca Bartolometi.

01:18:01.976 --> 01:18:03.912
That's one hell of a name.

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.115
Listen, Freddie.

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:09.450
This is the only copy I have.

01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:10.485
Well, if it's so important
to you,

01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:11.519
why don't you go take it...

01:18:11.552 --> 01:18:13.288
Just go straight there.

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:14.589
They'll give you a check.

01:18:14.622 --> 01:18:17.425
Bring it back here
as soon as you have it.

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.362
Please.

01:18:21.128 --> 01:18:22.164
Cool.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.169
Freddie...

01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:31.807
Thank you.

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:34.943
Catch you later, crib job.

01:19:26.494 --> 01:19:28.563
<i>Margo?</i>

01:19:28.596 --> 01:19:31.065
<i>Please don't hang up.</i>

01:19:31.098 --> 01:19:32.267
I wanted to call

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.905
to tell you how sorry I am

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.974
for how I've behaved, how I...

01:19:40.474 --> 01:19:42.644
how I treated you...

01:19:43.644 --> 01:19:45.614
how I treated everyone.

01:19:47.214 --> 01:19:49.584
Listen, I... I finished
the book.

01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:52.420
And it's all in there.

01:19:52.453 --> 01:19:55.590
You, me, us...

01:19:57.391 --> 01:20:00.061
And I realize this...

01:20:00.094 --> 01:20:01.996
it doesn't even begin
to make things right.

01:20:02.029 --> 01:20:04.432
But I just didn't know where...

01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:08.103
where else to start.

01:20:09.503 --> 01:20:12.574
So I was hoping
if you read this...

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:17.646
that you would see it as
some kind of consolation as...

01:20:21.682 --> 01:20:23.618
as to how much I love you.

01:20:27.154 --> 01:20:29.124
And I'm so sorry.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:33.194
My mommy's
not home right now.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:38.533
- What?
- Mommy's not here.

01:20:39.633 --> 01:20:40.635
Bye.

01:20:55.349 --> 01:20:57.452
<i>I... I don't know
his last name.</i>

01:20:57.485 --> 01:21:00.321
<i>Listen,
I don't know no Freddie.</i>

01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:03.624
- He delivers for you.
- <i>Senora,</i> I cannot help you.

01:21:03.657 --> 01:21:06.227
- What?
- Okay?

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.296
Can I speak to Enrique, please?

01:21:08.329 --> 01:21:12.467
Listen, Enrique no here. Okay?

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.070
Okay, listen, listen,
this is, this is really...

01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:17.505
- No, no, no, no.
- So...

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.326
Freddie?

01:21:43.264 --> 01:21:45.099
Freddie?

01:23:58.799 --> 01:23:59.767
Ah.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:28.422
- Stop!
- That's good, man.

01:25:28.455 --> 01:25:29.790
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:31.592
- Go. Go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:25:35.696 --> 01:25:37.431
Let's go! Let's do this!

01:25:41.802 --> 01:25:44.472
- Hey, don't be stupid!
- Go, go, go!

01:25:44.505 --> 01:25:46.007
- Come on! Come on!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:25:51.879 --> 01:25:55.483
Y'all wrong!
Motherfuckers, get outta here!

01:25:55.516 --> 01:25:56.651
Hey, get out of here!

01:25:58.352 --> 01:25:59.954
No, the one on the top!

01:25:59.987 --> 01:26:01.622
Well,
the lights are all out

01:26:01.655 --> 01:26:04.058
here at Shea Stadium.
All the lights are out.

01:26:04.091 --> 01:26:06.594
Uh, we see matches.
People are starting to fight...

01:26:07.961 --> 01:26:09.330
Traffic lights
are not working,

01:26:09.363 --> 01:26:10.798
so it is hazardous.

01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:13.034
Some looting has been reported.

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:16.837
Several people report
having been stuck in elevators.

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:20.374
New York City does have
everything under control.

01:26:20.407 --> 01:26:22.443
Hospitals and so on
are operating

01:26:22.476 --> 01:26:24.612
on their own auxiliary power.

01:26:24.645 --> 01:26:28.316
The best advice
is to keep cool, stay calm.

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.484
New York City will prevail.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.103
I wanna
get out of here. Oh!

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.111
Come on!

01:27:04.651 --> 01:27:06.354
Get out, motherfucker!

01:27:07.554 --> 01:27:09.724
Eat this, motherfucker!

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.559
Fuck you, cops!

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.805
...due to the fact
that the fire wasn't electrical

01:27:24.838 --> 01:27:26.974
in nature
and it caused a break...

01:28:05.479 --> 01:28:07.849
- I'm warning you...
- Yo, what the...

01:28:11.652 --> 01:28:13.521
Come here! Open up!

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.923
I don't mess in here.

01:28:31.605 --> 01:28:32.840
Let go!

01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:01.469
What?

01:29:02.803 --> 01:29:04.138
Freddie?

01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:06.106
- Move it!
- Freddie!

01:29:06.139 --> 01:29:08.476
- Ah!
- No! No!

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.645
Oh, my God! Freddie!

01:30:55.649 --> 01:30:57.184
Freddie...

01:30:57.217 --> 01:30:59.253
Oh, no. Freddie?

01:30:59.286 --> 01:31:00.321
No.

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.761
Freddie? Freddie?

01:31:12.065 --> 01:31:13.334
Oh...

01:32:51.998 --> 01:32:55.069
Your new book
is a phenomenal feat

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:58.138
of personal reflection
and atonement.

01:32:58.171 --> 01:32:59.907
Now, some have speculated
that this book

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:03.977
is a quasi-autobiographical
testament

01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:07.347
to your time spent
in a severe isolation period

01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.017
following the fallout
and controversy

01:33:10.050 --> 01:33:11.785
of your previous novel.

01:33:11.818 --> 01:33:13.721
You've somehow
managed to obtain...

01:33:15.956 --> 01:33:17.925
...of what has been
one of the darkest periods

01:33:17.958 --> 01:33:19.927
in this nation's history,

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.130
while at the same time
making it so personal.

01:33:23.163 --> 01:33:26.433
So I suppose
this all begs a question, June.

01:33:26.466 --> 01:33:28.335
Is this character you?
