WEBVTT

00:23.123 --> 00:24.258
I can't remember--

00:24.325 --> 00:26.530
whose birthday is it today?
- It's ours!

00:26.597 --> 00:28.133
- Oh, my gosh,
how old are they?

00:28.200 --> 00:30.437
- It's ours. We're eight.
- They're eight?

00:30.504 --> 00:32.208
- Is it your birthday?
- Oh, my gosh.

00:32.275 --> 00:34.179
You trying to pick her up?
- Yeah.

00:34.245 --> 00:36.049
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

00:36.115 --> 00:38.721
You really are eight.
You're so strong.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.756
Hey, honey, do you think

00:39.823 --> 00:42.094
you can still make
your you-know-what?

00:42.161 --> 00:43.531
Pineapple upside down cake!

00:43.598 --> 00:46.302
- I wanna flip it!
- You wanna flip it?

00:46.369 --> 00:48.908
I don't know, Annie,
it's a science.

00:48.975 --> 00:50.545
- Arms up.
- Hey.

00:50.612 --> 00:51.747
- Arms down.

00:51.814 --> 00:54.051
Can you do the chicken?

00:54.118 --> 00:56.056
Can you--

00:56.123 --> 00:57.525
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey?

00:57.592 --> 00:59.763
Will I keep wearing this?

00:59.830 --> 01:01.500
Your CTR ring?

01:05.340 --> 01:09.983
Choose the right.

01:10.050 --> 01:13.691
See, baptism is your first
covenant to heavenly Father,

01:13.758 --> 01:18.968
and it's gonna wash away
all those little baby sins.

01:19.034 --> 01:25.013
But then after that,
any new sin is yours to repent.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.253
And this ring
is gonna remind you

01:28.320 --> 01:31.025
to obey heavenly Father's
commandment.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.764
- Choose the right.

01:33.831 --> 01:35.334
- Look at me.

01:41.179 --> 01:43.884
Come to America,

01:43.951 --> 01:48.594
where the Prophet Joseph Smith
has unearthed a New Testament

01:48.661 --> 01:52.434
of the everlasting Gospel
of Christ,

01:52.502 --> 01:55.240
which vanquishes
the lie of original sin

01:55.307 --> 01:59.481
that our children
are inherently evil,

01:59.549 --> 02:03.757
for mankind is inherently good.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.666
Come to America
and hear a true prophet

02:07.732 --> 02:13.945
share how the Lord God Almighty
speaks directly to us all.

02:14.011 --> 02:16.182
Come to America

02:16.249 --> 02:20.223
for the gathering of Israel
to build a new Zion.

02:21.994 --> 02:23.931
Come to America.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.230
Mornin'.
- Good morning.

02:40.297 --> 02:41.600
Couldn't you rest?

02:41.667 --> 02:44.071
- It was a very exciting night.

02:44.138 --> 02:45.608
Yeah, two males in custody,

02:45.675 --> 02:46.944
and you've kept them
separate, right?

02:47.011 --> 02:48.847
Allen didn't see
Robin being brought in,

02:48.914 --> 02:50.585
I made sure of that.

02:50.652 --> 02:52.154
- Any updates?
- Nothing yet.

02:52.221 --> 02:54.391
You share any details
with Robin about this case?

02:54.458 --> 02:56.196
- Zippo.
- So if he knows anything

02:56.262 --> 02:57.532
about what happened here...

02:57.599 --> 02:59.134
Think it's as good
as a confession.

03:01.273 --> 03:03.076
- Morning.

03:03.143 --> 03:04.946
Sister Seacat?
- Yeah.

03:05.013 --> 03:07.585
- Hi, how are you?
I'm Detective Pyre.

03:07.652 --> 03:09.288
Is it all right if we ask you
a few questions

03:09.355 --> 03:10.792
about what you may have seen
last night?

03:10.859 --> 03:13.263
- Um, yeah, of course.
All right.

03:13.329 --> 03:15.902
So spare no details,
whatever you remember.

03:15.968 --> 03:20.644
- Okay. Um, four men.

03:20.711 --> 03:24.720
Two in the backseat of a car
parked, uh, there.

03:26.590 --> 03:30.296
And a third one
went in the front door.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.338
When I came out
for more groceries,

03:34.405 --> 03:38.313
the fourth one was gone.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.585
And, uh,
can you describe the car?

03:40.652 --> 03:43.122
- Maybe it was blue or green.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.862
I--I didn't look closely.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.445
- Do you think you
can recall what these--

03:54.512 --> 03:55.848
these men looked like?

03:55.915 --> 04:01.326
- Um, th--they had beards,
like, um, pioneer men,

04:01.392 --> 04:03.330
the kind you come
across down South or--

04:03.396 --> 04:04.732
or up the mountains here.

04:04.799 --> 04:06.803
Like all Mormon prophets.

04:06.870 --> 04:09.008
Do you know
if that neighbor's right,

04:09.074 --> 04:10.578
hiding in those hills
would be good cover

04:10.644 --> 04:12.582
for bearded mountain men.

04:12.649 --> 04:14.552
Heaven knows they'd stick out
down here in the valley.

04:14.619 --> 04:16.055
Mm.
- Might wanna check

04:16.121 --> 04:18.426
with Forest Services.
- Maybe she's right.

04:18.494 --> 04:19.663
We have no motive to speak of.

04:19.729 --> 04:22.000
We have no idea who
the other three men could be

04:22.067 --> 04:24.740
or if they could be
after anyone else.

04:24.807 --> 04:27.579
We could call in the press,
get the public's eye out.

04:27.646 --> 04:28.681
- I don't know,
Chief will wanna make

04:28.747 --> 04:30.752
that call when he gets back.

04:30.819 --> 04:33.023
But update the APB
to include three bearded men,

04:33.090 --> 04:35.561
armed and dangerous,
and see if anything unusual

04:35.628 --> 04:38.968
is coming from Forest Services,
and maybe I'll--

04:39.034 --> 04:43.309
and I'll head back, see if
I can get Robin talking...

04:43.376 --> 04:46.382
before we need more body bags.

04:55.669 --> 04:57.270
- Crime lab just called.
- Mm.

04:57.337 --> 04:59.274
- Allen's prints weren't
at Robin's place,

04:59.341 --> 05:00.512
but they're all over
his own house.

05:00.578 --> 05:01.947
- Well, it is his home.
What about the--

05:02.014 --> 05:03.584
the handprint
on the nursery door?

05:03.651 --> 05:05.054
- It wasn't Allen's.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.457
It wasn't his in the blood
by the front door, either.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.202
They're looking
for Robin's prints now?

05:13.269 --> 05:14.405
Yes, sir.

05:16.644 --> 05:19.315
- Sister Dorren,
it is Brother Pyre.

05:19.381 --> 05:22.020
It is always a joy
to hear from you, brother.

05:22.087 --> 05:23.523
Hm, how can I help?

05:23.590 --> 05:26.496
- Oh, well, I'm in a bind.
I'm on a case,

05:26.563 --> 05:29.435
and I can't get home
to help with my--

05:29.503 --> 05:31.305
my daughters' birthday party.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.842
Oh, I know how important

05:32.909 --> 05:34.679
those little girls are to you.

05:34.746 --> 05:36.282
I will call
my sisters into service.

05:36.349 --> 05:37.919
Oh, Sister,
you're a lifesaver.

05:37.986 --> 05:39.990
I appreciate it so much.
Thank you.

05:40.056 --> 05:43.096
But since I have you,
I heard a rumor.

05:43.163 --> 05:45.267
Was a Lafferty hurt?

06:09.917 --> 06:13.222
Mind if I put some
music on, brother?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.458
It's been a long day already.

06:14.526 --> 06:18.133
I find our tabernacle choir
real comforting.

06:19.268 --> 06:22.208
Oh, that's good.

06:26.315 --> 06:27.585
You know this model?

06:30.256 --> 06:34.599
- It's top of the line, I hear,
but if you could show me

06:34.666 --> 06:36.269
around her bells and whistles,

06:36.336 --> 06:38.073
I'd be real appreciative,
Brother.

06:40.811 --> 06:43.651
No? Never seen this one?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.026
- I'll leave the choir on
for you.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.173
Brother?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.444
- Yeah.

06:57.512 --> 06:59.481
- Why am I here?

06:59.549 --> 07:01.151
- Well, I--I don't wanna
keep you here

07:01.218 --> 07:02.889
any longer than I have to.

07:02.955 --> 07:07.097
It's the truth.

07:07.164 --> 07:11.606
So is there anything other than
the bonfire in your backyard

07:11.673 --> 07:13.811
that I should be
concerned about?

07:16.683 --> 07:18.587
I'm a good LDS man.

07:18.653 --> 07:21.192
I've been a bishop
and a seminary teacher.

07:21.258 --> 07:22.427
- Oh, no, I appreciate that.

07:22.495 --> 07:25.634
I--when I was a boy,
I got up sunrise

07:25.701 --> 07:28.273
five days a week for seminary,
so.

07:28.339 --> 07:30.878
Let's just see if we can
resolve this quickly.

07:30.945 --> 07:33.651
Your wife said there was an
electrical issue in your house.

07:33.718 --> 07:35.453
- Yes.
- But that doesn't explain

07:35.521 --> 07:39.128
why you ran from my officers.

07:39.194 --> 07:43.937
- Well, from 1795 on,

07:44.004 --> 07:46.944
the government began discarding
God's wisdom,

07:47.011 --> 07:49.482
restricting the very thing
that our founding fathers

07:49.549 --> 07:51.486
held dearest--
our God-given freedom,

07:51.554 --> 07:57.097
so I ran
from wrongful persecution

07:57.164 --> 07:59.870
for failing
to follow wayward laws

07:59.936 --> 08:03.944
that harm our LDS families.

08:06.248 --> 08:08.419
- No?

08:08.486 --> 08:13.664
Do we not risk more eternal
consequence than prison bars

08:13.730 --> 08:19.041
if we follow unjust,
unholy laws, Brother?

08:40.283 --> 08:41.285
- Morning.

08:47.565 --> 08:50.671
Get any sleep last night?

08:50.738 --> 08:54.746
- If--if I sleep,
then I'll wake up.

08:54.812 --> 08:57.350
And if I'm still here,

08:57.417 --> 08:59.989
then it isn't just a nightmare.

09:02.327 --> 09:05.266
- I'd like your help, Allen.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.638
But first, I gotta
clear something up.

09:07.705 --> 09:10.410
Why did you have
Brenda's blood on your knees

09:10.477 --> 09:13.349
and on your hands?

09:13.416 --> 09:16.523
- I knelt down in it

09:16.589 --> 09:19.629
to pray for her

09:19.695 --> 09:21.933
and for our baby girl.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.637
- Thought you'd lost
your faith.

09:26.175 --> 09:27.812
- It was, uh...

09:29.782 --> 09:32.755
My last unanswered prayer.

09:35.627 --> 09:38.934
- Say I believe you--

09:39.001 --> 09:42.509
that bearded men
did invade your family

09:42.575 --> 09:44.478
and your home--

09:44.546 --> 09:46.181
I would need names.

09:48.018 --> 09:52.227
I would need descriptions
if--if I have any chance

09:52.294 --> 09:55.901
of finding out who did this
to Brenda and Erica.

10:04.351 --> 10:06.121
- I only saw them once.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.299
I was on a tiling job.

10:11.366 --> 10:12.635
Dan was with me.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.676
This would have been
about a year ago.

10:16.743 --> 10:18.980
He--he kept asking me
to go to this--

10:19.047 --> 10:22.855
go to this meeting with him
that night.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.663
I--I can't, um,
remember the name of the group.

10:26.730 --> 10:28.232
- There was a group?

10:28.299 --> 10:30.771
Yeah, something patriotic.

10:30.837 --> 10:34.646
It was about fighting taxes.

10:34.712 --> 10:38.854
Anyway, um,
when our work was done,

10:38.921 --> 10:41.459
this car pulled up
with two men in it.

10:41.527 --> 10:43.530
Uh, one was old.

10:43.597 --> 10:50.009
Uh, he had white hair and,
um, this long, braided beard.

10:50.076 --> 10:53.382
He--he looked at me,
right at me,

10:53.449 --> 10:55.955
and smiled, like--like he knew
everything about me.

10:56.022 --> 11:00.964
- And then the other man?
- Uh, yeah, he was round.

11:01.031 --> 11:04.572
He had dark hair--brown.

11:04.639 --> 11:08.680
Anyway, Dan got in the car,
and--and they drove off.

11:08.747 --> 11:10.349
- All right, so three men,
two with beards.

11:10.416 --> 11:12.822
Like, hippie beards?
- No, no, no, no.

11:12.888 --> 11:15.427
Like old Mormon beards.
I told you.

11:15.495 --> 11:18.299
And--and there were four
in the car, not--not three.

11:18.366 --> 11:22.307
My--my brother Robin
was in the back.

11:33.329 --> 11:38.741
- Hi. Detective Taba
from down in East Rockwell.

11:38.807 --> 11:42.113
I hear there's been reports
of gunfire up this way lately.

11:44.117 --> 11:46.289
Must have been extraordinary

11:46.355 --> 11:48.727
for it to raise concern
way up here.

11:50.598 --> 11:52.433
No?
- Uh-huh.

11:52.501 --> 11:55.874
- Anything, anyone unusual
up here recently?

11:57.144 --> 11:59.915
- There's a bounty
of unusual up here,

11:59.982 --> 12:03.122
particularly unusual
to the eyes of a Lamanite.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.894
- Yeah, my daddy
was Paiute, actually.

12:07.799 --> 12:09.334
- Okay.

12:09.401 --> 12:12.007
How about we take a little
drive up this mountain, huh?

12:12.073 --> 12:13.910
If you're so curious.

12:26.302 --> 12:29.141
Allen, just to be clear,
your own brother, Dan Lafferty,

12:29.207 --> 12:32.314
was in an organized
anti-tax group?

12:32.380 --> 12:36.589
And your brother, Robin,
was in this anti-tax group too?

12:36.656 --> 12:39.327
- Well, sure.
I mean, he was always with Dan.

12:39.394 --> 12:41.098
That was his job.

12:41.165 --> 12:43.236
Our dad named him
Dan's right hand

12:43.302 --> 12:44.939
right before he left us
here alone.

12:45.006 --> 12:47.711
- And how was Robin
as Dan's right hand?

12:47.778 --> 12:51.451
- Uh, you seem real curious
about Robin for some reason.

12:51.519 --> 12:54.492
- That just sounds like
a challenging job he had.

12:56.997 --> 12:59.234
Challenging?

12:59.301 --> 13:01.873
I--I'd say an impossible job.

13:04.011 --> 13:05.714
- Robin, my mirror's in there.
Sorry.

13:05.781 --> 13:07.017
I'm so sorry.

13:07.084 --> 13:08.720
Trust you plan
on helping my boys

13:08.787 --> 13:11.391
move their things into
their father's clinic today.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.195
- Uh, yes.

13:13.262 --> 13:16.235
- We're leaving you with so
many new responsibilities.

13:16.302 --> 13:17.805
This is my husband's
appointment book

13:17.872 --> 13:20.844
and his bill book
for his patients.

13:20.911 --> 13:23.382
This has always been
my responsibility.

13:23.449 --> 13:26.388
We can't expect our husbands
to care for their patients,

13:26.455 --> 13:28.760
mind the schedule,
and sort all the bills, can we?

13:28.827 --> 13:30.697
You mean me?

13:30.764 --> 13:32.936
Yes.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.908
Our husbands are
Latter-day Saints.

13:35.974 --> 13:39.481
Our duty is to help them
stand that tall

13:39.548 --> 13:41.552
without them knowing
we're holding them up.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.795
Dan needs holdin'.

13:45.862 --> 13:48.399
Understood?

13:48.465 --> 13:50.504
- Yes.

13:50.571 --> 13:51.873
Dan?

13:55.346 --> 13:58.921
Out there in the
Louisiana hinterlands,

13:58.987 --> 14:01.225
we won't find many a phone.

14:01.292 --> 14:03.797
This is the number
of the nearest LDS ward.

14:03.864 --> 14:05.567
Okay.
- For emergencies only.

14:05.634 --> 14:06.769
- Absolutely.

14:06.836 --> 14:07.705
You mustn't waste money now.

14:07.772 --> 14:09.809
- Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.

14:09.876 --> 14:12.514
No, sir.

14:12.581 --> 14:14.017
- No, sir.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.688
- I won't let you down.

14:15.754 --> 14:17.591
No, you won't.

14:27.076 --> 14:31.184
I'm--I'm gonna go
check on Jacob.

14:31.251 --> 14:32.555
Hey.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.024
Consolidating military bases

14:34.090 --> 14:35.460
on Okinawa.

14:35.527 --> 14:37.498
But a Pentagon
spokesman won't say

14:37.564 --> 14:39.735
whether that means
the U.S. would move troops

14:39.802 --> 14:41.540
to other parts of Okinawa.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.142
Um...

14:43.209 --> 14:44.812
gosh, we won't be having
that squirrel

14:44.879 --> 14:48.318
for lunch now, will we?

14:48.385 --> 14:49.655
Huh?

14:52.695 --> 14:54.197
I know.

14:55.901 --> 15:00.176
Your folks are leaving.
It's hard.

15:00.243 --> 15:03.683
- Oh.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.989
I'm sure they'd love to see
your face as they wave goodbye.

15:09.361 --> 15:10.998
It's okay.

15:11.064 --> 15:14.137
I'll help take care of you.

15:14.204 --> 15:19.448
- As I set out on the
second mission of my life,

15:19.515 --> 15:21.418
Mother's first,

15:21.485 --> 15:23.623
we pray to bring more souls
unto thee

15:23.690 --> 15:26.663
and thy one true church.

15:26.729 --> 15:30.102
And we ask--we ask that
thou bless Dan's stewardship

15:30.169 --> 15:32.106
over our temporal affairs.

15:32.173 --> 15:35.379
It's not simply to maintain
what is ours, but to--

15:35.446 --> 15:39.522
to continue building upon it.

15:39.588 --> 15:46.268
No matter what in this life,
that it may grow in eternity.

15:46.335 --> 15:48.774
These things we pray
in Thy holy name.

16:00.029 --> 16:03.970
- The house is ours now, boys.
New generals in town, ladies.

16:04.037 --> 16:05.707
Make me my breakfast, woman.
Get!

16:05.774 --> 16:06.742
- Hoo!
- Go!

16:06.809 --> 16:07.911
- Stop!
- Yee-haw!

16:07.978 --> 16:08.880
- That's it! Go!
- Pow, pow, pow, pow!

16:08.947 --> 16:09.882
- Hey, hey.

16:09.949 --> 16:10.951
- Guys! Hey!
- Come on.

16:11.018 --> 16:12.588
- Hey! Hey!

16:16.294 --> 16:18.700
Dad only made
Dan head of house

16:18.767 --> 16:21.740
to get back at Ron
for going his own way.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.077
I mean, Dan wasn't ready.

16:24.144 --> 16:26.516
And neither was
his wife, Matilda.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.520
- Yes, well, it'll be--
it's actually Dan

16:28.587 --> 16:31.926
who'll be popping your neck
now, isn't that great?

16:31.993 --> 16:33.763
Oh, well,
maybe we could offer you

16:33.830 --> 16:35.032
a little discount or something.

16:35.099 --> 16:37.136
If you're running low, we can--

16:40.109 --> 16:44.284
- Matilda, you--
you're not changing prices

16:44.351 --> 16:46.857
without asking our new man
of the house, are you?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.662
- No.

16:49.729 --> 16:51.666
They were in over their heads.

16:51.733 --> 16:55.106
And that's why I thought
it best to--to lay low.

16:55.172 --> 16:58.045
But Brenda, I mean,
she'd go into a pound

16:58.112 --> 17:00.751
and come out
with every cat, dog,

17:00.818 --> 17:02.821
and baby skunk under her arm.

17:02.888 --> 17:07.163
- Hmm.
- Oh.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.238
- Hey, look,
just trust your gut.

17:11.305 --> 17:12.875
My gut's all in knots.

17:12.942 --> 17:15.046
I can't do this.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.883
- Do you wanna know a trick?

17:16.949 --> 17:20.189
Um, when I get stage fright,

17:20.256 --> 17:22.293
I just listen
for the promptings

17:22.360 --> 17:24.130
of the Holy Spirit.

17:24.197 --> 17:26.836
Like, once I was
in a Shakespeare play,

17:26.903 --> 17:31.178
and, poof, I forgot everything.

17:31.245 --> 17:33.717
But I heard him say,
"Cross downstage,"

17:33.783 --> 17:35.286
so I did.

17:35.353 --> 17:39.260
And when I got there,
every word came back.

17:39.327 --> 17:42.969
Some say, um, men can hear
the Holy Spirit better.

17:43.035 --> 17:46.275
That's not true. We can.

17:46.341 --> 17:47.812
'Cause, you know,
we don't get at all mixed up

17:47.878 --> 17:49.916
with the promptings
of our you-know-whats.

17:55.827 --> 17:58.198
- Can I tell you a secret?

17:58.265 --> 18:01.205
- Sure. I'm good with secrets.

18:01.271 --> 18:05.681
- So you, uh,
got yourself a Marlin, huh?

18:05.747 --> 18:07.818
- Yeah? You like her?

18:07.884 --> 18:10.289
- I mean, she's gorgeous.

18:12.026 --> 18:13.395
But--

18:16.435 --> 18:20.443
Well, look, uh, before I
popped the question to Lynn,

18:20.511 --> 18:25.921
Dad, he gave me
a little advice.

18:25.988 --> 18:28.493
All right?
He said that, um--

18:28.560 --> 18:32.467
that the exciting stuff
wears off,

18:32.534 --> 18:35.439
you know, and that
what's really important

18:35.507 --> 18:39.348
is that you find
a woman who will help you

18:39.414 --> 18:41.586
build a family for eternity.

18:41.652 --> 18:43.288
I mean, that's--
that's why we're here, right?

18:43.355 --> 18:45.092
- Right.
- Yeah.

18:45.159 --> 18:49.101
Not--not for worldly ambitions.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.806
We're not here to meddle.

18:54.311 --> 18:58.285
- She says she wants
a family, so.

18:58.352 --> 19:01.324
- Right, but so then
why is she going to BYU?

19:04.097 --> 19:07.270
Look, all I know is that Dan--

19:07.336 --> 19:10.076
Dan's not gonna like her
stepping on his toes,

19:10.143 --> 19:11.311
and he's the man
of the house now,

19:11.377 --> 19:16.188
so just mind your property.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.325
- Got it.

19:19.896 --> 19:22.333
So Robin didn't like
having Brenda around.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.672
Brenda just wanted
to help, you know,

19:24.738 --> 19:28.847
but in ways that some
more traditional,

19:28.914 --> 19:32.922
old-fashioned LDS men
might see as interference.

19:32.988 --> 19:36.763
I can't hear the
Holy Spirit anymore.

19:36.829 --> 19:39.267
- Oh.

19:39.334 --> 19:41.405
It's not, like,
an actual voice.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.044
- No?
But I--I used to hear it

19:44.110 --> 19:47.585
'cause it was the Holy Spirit
who told me to come to Utah.

19:47.651 --> 19:48.686
- Really?

19:48.753 --> 19:50.489
- I mean, I had visions
as well...

19:52.026 --> 19:55.433
Telling me to marry Dan,
so I--I flew out here,

19:55.500 --> 19:57.538
and I made him cheese
sandwiches for a picnic,

19:57.604 --> 19:59.942
and I told him
all about my visions.

20:00.009 --> 20:02.514
And do you know what he said?

20:02.581 --> 20:05.419
Heavenly Father had already
told him to marry me too.

20:06.723 --> 20:08.760
- Holy cow.

20:08.827 --> 20:12.834
- But what if it wasn't God
that said it to him?

20:14.739 --> 20:21.619
Like, what if it was his father
who told him that I was broken,

20:21.686 --> 20:23.890
like, broken enough
to say yes to a never-married

20:23.957 --> 20:26.328
27-year-old Mormon
who smoked and drank

20:26.394 --> 20:30.703
and fancied my sister.

20:32.842 --> 20:36.582
You know, people used to say
that God bent us both up

20:36.649 --> 20:38.686
so that we'd we fit right.

20:40.957 --> 20:43.295
Then after we got married,

20:43.362 --> 20:47.804
he got so perfect.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.209
It's like a miracle.

20:50.276 --> 20:52.547
And I'm still all bent up.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.551
And if I fail him now--
No, no.

20:54.618 --> 20:57.557
- I don't want to.
- You're not gonna fail him.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.799
You know what I think?

21:01.866 --> 21:05.741
I think that the Holy Spirit
is so close to you,

21:05.807 --> 21:09.347
you don't even realize
it's his voice you're hearing.

21:09.414 --> 21:12.588
Come on, let's try one
together.

21:12.654 --> 21:13.589
Yeah?

21:16.194 --> 21:17.363
Okay.

21:17.430 --> 21:18.900
- Will you please
stay close to me?

21:21.037 --> 21:22.607
I think God sent you to me.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.047
Sure.

21:26.114 --> 21:29.454
So the more she tried
to get involved,

21:29.522 --> 21:32.259
the more I thought best
to just get--

21:32.326 --> 21:33.997
get her away.
To get her away

21:34.063 --> 21:37.872
from your more old-fashioned
LDS brothers?

21:37.938 --> 21:39.608
- Yeah, well, except Ron.

21:39.675 --> 21:42.914
Ron was an island,
you know, more modern.

21:42.981 --> 21:44.985
He wanted little to do
with the brothers.

21:45.052 --> 21:46.355
- Good day. How are you?

21:46.421 --> 21:48.960
- I think he and Diana
really hoped that--

21:49.027 --> 21:52.500
that I'd go their way,
and I thought it might be safer

21:52.567 --> 21:55.540
or a better fit for Brenda.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.546
- All I'm saying is that
the kids won't miss

21:58.613 --> 22:00.584
what they never knew
was coming.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.053
If we don't have
the cash disbursements,

22:02.120 --> 22:03.589
then we'll have it next.
- This isn't about the money.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.825
It's an investment.

22:04.892 --> 22:06.161
Hey, you wanna
give that to her?

22:06.228 --> 22:07.765
Come on.

22:07.831 --> 22:10.303
Look, an addition like this
will increase

22:10.369 --> 22:12.575
the house value, all right?

22:12.641 --> 22:14.545
- What's the addition?

22:14.612 --> 22:15.948
- It's top secret.

22:16.014 --> 22:17.985
If I tell you,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

22:18.051 --> 22:19.487
It's a swimming pool.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.793
- Ta-da! For you.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.563
- How am I
supposed to eat that?

22:23.629 --> 22:25.266
- Well, if you don't want it,
I'll give it to Allen.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.401
- No, no, no, no, look at it.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.372
Look.

22:28.438 --> 22:30.309
It's like a Picasso.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.681
- Belongs here in the
Guggenheim of whipped cheese.

22:32.748 --> 22:35.654
You better make ugly ones,
or we're gonna starve.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.056
See? She can't even eat it.

22:38.826 --> 22:41.532
- Um, you know,
we've actually been discussing

22:41.599 --> 22:44.437
the construction downtrend
in my journalism class.

22:44.504 --> 22:46.742
Experts agree we haven't
seen the worst of it yet.

22:46.809 --> 22:48.178
Yeah, sure,
but if I win another term

22:48.245 --> 22:50.215
in the city council,
folks would be less inclined

22:50.282 --> 22:51.619
to be sticklers
about due dates,

22:51.685 --> 22:54.123
and I can give 'em wiggle room
on things like zoning.

22:54.190 --> 22:57.196
- Hold on, so if you win,
you're above the law?

22:57.263 --> 22:58.599
- I didn't say that.

22:58.666 --> 23:00.504
Well, you have my vote,
of course,

23:00.570 --> 23:02.306
but if you don't
win again, I'd be happy

23:02.373 --> 23:04.845
because that would mean
you'd spend more time at home.

23:04.911 --> 23:07.249
- What if I can't help but win?

23:07.316 --> 23:08.853
Yeah, but there's
no shame in slowing down

23:08.920 --> 23:11.257
if, you know, things slow down.

23:11.324 --> 23:14.999
- If things slow down,
projects get foreclosed on.

23:15.065 --> 23:17.538
And that's sad, but it's like
a half-off sale for property

23:17.604 --> 23:19.809
if you're paying attention.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.981
You know, I got less
distractions now than ever,

23:23.048 --> 23:27.089
so this could
prove beneficial to us.

23:27.156 --> 23:30.462
Yeah, Brenda,
she was smart, you know.

23:30.530 --> 23:33.435
She often saw what I couldn't--

23:33.502 --> 23:36.007
the trouble, the recession.

23:36.074 --> 23:39.615
- Well, I've been thinking
that if--if times get tough,

23:39.682 --> 23:41.786
the first things folks might
scratch off their list

23:41.853 --> 23:45.827
are mini golf, movies,
and the chiropractor,

23:45.893 --> 23:46.896
you know, so--
- Brenda.

23:46.963 --> 23:49.602
- It's just
from what I can see,

23:49.669 --> 23:52.774
Dan and Matilda could use
all the help they can get.

23:54.544 --> 23:55.947
Here.

23:56.014 --> 23:58.318
- Hold on.

23:58.385 --> 24:02.628
I shall go and do the things
the Lord hath commanded.

24:02.695 --> 24:04.732
And the Lord told Dad to go
one way,

24:04.799 --> 24:06.535
drag poor Dan with him,

24:06.602 --> 24:10.977
and leads me another way,
away from that energy

24:11.044 --> 24:12.781
that isn't right for me
and my family,

24:12.848 --> 24:15.953
and I have to put
my family first.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.458
It's been like that
for a long time now.

24:18.526 --> 24:20.095
Right, Allen?

24:20.162 --> 24:24.237
But Ron, I'm afraid
he didn't appreciate

24:24.304 --> 24:27.544
her sharing her doubts.

24:27.610 --> 24:29.915
Whether Ron admitted it
or not, he was--

24:29.982 --> 24:32.821
he was Ammon Lafferty's eldest.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.994
He obeyed
our father's commandment

24:36.061 --> 24:37.731
just in the same way
that Dan and Robin did,

24:37.798 --> 24:40.068
you know, to keep
building no matter what.

24:40.135 --> 24:41.539
- You mean
heavenly Father's commandment

24:41.606 --> 24:43.275
or your own father's
commandment?

24:43.342 --> 24:46.648
Well, both, I guess.

24:46.715 --> 24:49.722
After Joseph finished
the Book of Mormon

24:49.789 --> 24:53.094
and converts
started flooding in,

24:53.161 --> 24:56.769
he moved them all
to Kirtland, Ohio, didn't he,

24:56.836 --> 24:59.708
to build a new Zion.

24:59.775 --> 25:01.879
In that history,
my father found

25:01.946 --> 25:04.785
a gruesome, violent story.

25:04.852 --> 25:08.225
It was a story he used
to motivate us,

25:08.291 --> 25:10.663
you know, that fueled us.

25:10.730 --> 25:13.435
- Help!
- Do you hear that?

25:13.502 --> 25:15.072
Help!

25:15.138 --> 25:16.441
- Emma, stay here.
Wait!

25:16.509 --> 25:18.345
- Stay here.
Help!

25:18.412 --> 25:20.115
They got my dog!

25:24.256 --> 25:25.459
What's going on here?

25:25.527 --> 25:26.796
I need help.
- Come here.

25:26.863 --> 25:28.365
- For the prophet,
another lamb.

25:28.432 --> 25:30.135
- Stop this madness now!

25:30.202 --> 25:32.039
Cut it down.
I'll pay for the lamb.

25:32.106 --> 25:34.845
You people owe us
for more than just one lamb.

25:34.912 --> 25:38.485
My people's land you
built upon without permission.

25:38.552 --> 25:43.061
The wood, stone, brick,
you guaranteed payment for.

25:43.128 --> 25:46.101
But the Ohioans
we met there, their governors,

25:46.168 --> 25:49.842
their militiamen, didn't
welcome our peculiar people

25:49.908 --> 25:52.080
with open arms, did they?

25:52.146 --> 25:54.250
I wanna give you something--

25:54.317 --> 25:56.622
something that means
a great deal to me.

25:58.392 --> 26:02.466
Here, take this as a deposit.

26:02.534 --> 26:05.005
A promise.

26:05.072 --> 26:07.242
End this now.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.159
No! No! No!

26:15.226 --> 26:18.899
- Dog gets the taste of lamb,
it never loses it.

26:18.966 --> 26:22.073
Only trespasses more--
eats more of what ain't his.

26:22.139 --> 26:23.710
- Charles, Charles.
It's all right.

26:23.776 --> 26:25.847
It's all right. It's all right.
It's fine.

26:25.914 --> 26:28.352
I'm within my rights
to end such thievery.

26:28.419 --> 26:31.290
- Beware...

26:31.357 --> 26:33.128
that you don't find yourself
in conflict

26:33.194 --> 26:35.366
with God's law,

26:35.432 --> 26:38.238
for man's will soon align
with heaven's here.

26:44.383 --> 26:47.223
- Mind the laws we got here,

26:47.289 --> 26:50.830
or face prosecution
like the dog you are.

26:53.836 --> 26:57.677
It was the story of how
the more challenges we faced,

26:57.744 --> 27:00.315
the more tests we endured,
you know,

27:00.382 --> 27:03.321
the more we could be sure that
we were on the righteous path.

27:09.601 --> 27:11.237
- I know.

27:15.178 --> 27:20.289
I'll help you bury him
after sunset,

27:20.355 --> 27:22.661
for he cannot rest
while the sun is above.

27:29.875 --> 27:34.383
If we wish for our
rightful place on Earth,

27:34.450 --> 27:38.291
the safety of Zion,

27:38.358 --> 27:39.762
we must build it.

27:39.828 --> 27:44.638
- We must build it,
no matter what.

28:16.367 --> 28:19.307
- The shooting went on
and on, so I hiked up here.

28:19.373 --> 28:21.746
Saw two men with a whole
lot of guns, big guns,

28:21.812 --> 28:24.316
making all this mess.

28:31.898 --> 28:33.401
A lot like the ones I found

28:33.468 --> 28:35.806
nailed on my front door
this morning.

28:35.873 --> 28:37.911
- What did these men look like?

28:37.978 --> 28:41.719
20s, 30s. Sturdy old clothes.

28:41.785 --> 28:44.290
- LDS pioneer types? Beards?

28:44.356 --> 28:46.896
- Yeah, got plenty
of that up here.

28:46.962 --> 28:49.167
What was unusual
was the girls with 'em.

28:49.233 --> 28:51.772
Looked like they'd just
stepped off a covered wagon.

28:51.839 --> 28:55.814
Saw me coming
and ran for their lives.

28:55.881 --> 28:57.651
Did you follow 'em?

28:57.718 --> 29:01.526
These boys, they weren't
afraid of raising eyebrows.

29:01.592 --> 29:03.729
They wanted my attention.

29:03.796 --> 29:05.800
But I'll tell you what, Chief,

29:05.867 --> 29:07.504
I didn't get
to this age putting my nose

29:07.570 --> 29:09.473
where it don't belong.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.243
I suggest you do the same.

29:15.619 --> 29:17.022
We're still waiting
on crime lab,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.026
but Allen's feeling chatty.

29:19.093 --> 29:20.362
He said that Robin
was involved

29:20.429 --> 29:22.767
in some kind of
anti-tax group.

29:22.834 --> 29:24.237
- You can sign me up for that.

29:25.707 --> 29:28.846
Uh, he also gave us
descriptions of two other men

29:28.912 --> 29:30.115
in that group, both bearded.

29:30.182 --> 29:31.652
We're following
those leads now.

29:31.718 --> 29:33.055
Okay, then I'm gonna
take a quick walk

29:33.121 --> 29:34.557
in these woods,
see if I can find

29:34.624 --> 29:38.265
those furry sons of guns who
ripped this place to shit--

29:38.331 --> 29:40.269
uh, bits.

29:40.336 --> 29:41.505
- Thank you.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.175
Listen, if you don't,
uh, hear from me

29:43.241 --> 29:45.813
by30, send somebody my way,
would you?

29:48.452 --> 29:50.355
- Copy that.
Be careful, please.

29:58.271 --> 30:03.515
Brother Lafferty, I could
really use your wisdom.

30:11.532 --> 30:15.071
Did you ever attend, uh,
any meetings of a group

30:15.138 --> 30:17.510
that was focused on tax issues?

30:19.113 --> 30:21.752
- You mean
Patriots for Freedom?

30:24.992 --> 30:28.298
- Those papers you were burning
in your, uh,

30:28.365 --> 30:31.872
in your backyard, they were
related to that group?

30:31.939 --> 30:35.278
Things you wanted
to make disappear?

30:37.483 --> 30:40.556
- My brothers and I,
we were building something,

30:40.623 --> 30:44.464
something modern and holy.

30:44.531 --> 30:48.071
But I worried that others
may not understand.

30:48.137 --> 30:51.511
- How's dodging the federal
tax man modern or holy?

30:53.181 --> 30:55.285
- No, you see,
you got it all mixed up.

30:55.352 --> 30:59.794
The taxes were the hurdle,
not the mission.

30:59.861 --> 31:02.633
Have you ever had
an adjustment?

31:02.700 --> 31:04.972
A chiropractic adjustment?

31:05.038 --> 31:06.509
It's our family business.

31:06.575 --> 31:10.550
Dan and I, we traveled
to Los Angeles

31:10.617 --> 31:12.419
to learn new methods,
new techniques.

31:12.486 --> 31:16.260
We brought them back to share
with our wider LDS family here.

31:16.327 --> 31:17.997
This was our holy mission.

31:19.935 --> 31:21.572
Heavenly Father,

31:21.638 --> 31:23.909
please guide my hands.

31:23.976 --> 31:25.680
- Okay, uh, stop it.

31:25.747 --> 31:27.282
Who are you talking to?

31:27.349 --> 31:29.120
- I'm talking to the Lord.

31:29.186 --> 31:30.590
The Lord guides my hands.

31:30.657 --> 31:31.959
You don't know what
you're doing yourself?

31:32.026 --> 31:34.363
No, no, brother.

31:34.430 --> 31:36.033
Brother, it's all right--
our--our methods

31:36.100 --> 31:37.604
are just a little different
from our father's.

31:37.670 --> 31:38.773
His are more old fashioned,

31:38.839 --> 31:41.444
and see, we, using the Spirit
as our guide--

31:41.512 --> 31:43.582
- Old fashioned
works fine for me.

31:43.649 --> 31:46.555
- Well, if old fashioned
works fine for you,

31:46.622 --> 31:47.924
then why do you have to keep
coming back here

31:47.991 --> 31:49.527
year after year?

31:49.594 --> 31:51.799
I mean, we want you
to get better.

31:51.865 --> 31:53.001
You understand?
Here, let me--

31:53.067 --> 31:54.169
let me show you something,
I think I might have

31:54.236 --> 31:55.640
helped you a little bit
with that.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.176
See, you're through
adjustment now.

31:57.242 --> 31:58.779
Now--and slowly
take a walk around.

31:58.846 --> 32:00.382
How does that feel?

32:00.449 --> 32:02.787
It feels better, doesn't it?
I can feel it. It looks better.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.192
- Yeah, I'm just more
comfortable with old fashioned.

32:05.258 --> 32:06.595
It's time to go, sweetheart.

32:06.661 --> 32:08.432
- Wha--what do you mean
time to go?

32:08.499 --> 32:10.469
No, there's still plenty of
time in--in our session left.

32:10.537 --> 32:11.905
We--um--
If you could just

32:11.972 --> 32:13.609
give us ten minutes,
then I think

32:13.675 --> 32:14.577
I could change your mind.

32:14.644 --> 32:16.414
- Okay, look,
Matilda, she's gonna

32:16.481 --> 32:18.384
give you a call in a few days,
see if you're feeling better.

32:18.451 --> 32:19.587
I think you're gonna be
feeling a lot better,

32:19.654 --> 32:21.091
and then maybe you wanna
book it again, hey?

32:21.157 --> 32:22.226
How about that?
Okay.

32:22.292 --> 32:23.629
Yeah, sounds good.
Okay, well,

32:23.696 --> 32:24.998
if that's how you feel,
I hope you have

32:25.064 --> 32:26.067
a great rest of your day.

32:26.134 --> 32:27.703
- You too.
- Mm-hmm.

32:33.348 --> 32:35.553
Did I say something
to offend him?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.323
Did you? No, no, no.
He's just--come on.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.626
This guy, he's an old grump.

32:38.692 --> 32:40.395
But when he feels better,
which he will,

32:40.462 --> 32:42.199
he's gonna wanna come back.
Absolutely.

32:42.266 --> 32:43.468
- It's all right.
- Wouldn't call him

32:43.536 --> 32:45.238
a very prayerful man,
would you?

32:45.305 --> 32:47.409
- No, I wouldn't, either.
- Yeah, you can say that twice.

32:47.475 --> 32:50.215
Wouldn't call him
a very prayerful man.

32:50.282 --> 32:52.553
Connect with that
and help him out.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.229
You're swamped
in the bills here, huh?

32:57.296 --> 32:58.666
- Um, yes.
We get the water

32:58.732 --> 33:00.402
and electricity paid?
- Uh, not yet.

33:00.469 --> 33:02.473
But there's
a past due tax bill,

33:02.541 --> 33:04.176
and there's a license fee
as well.

33:04.243 --> 33:08.284
- Mm, well, I think that
we need water and power

33:08.351 --> 33:10.823
more than the government
needs more of our money,

33:10.890 --> 33:12.827
don't you think?

33:12.894 --> 33:14.864
It's unbelievable.

33:14.931 --> 33:16.868
It really is.

33:16.935 --> 33:18.705
License fees.

33:18.772 --> 33:23.180
What--why do we have to pay
license fees anyway, Robin?

33:23.247 --> 33:24.684
What is that?
I--

33:24.751 --> 33:26.888
- Didn't--didn't--
heavenly Father

33:26.955 --> 33:28.993
give us our license for free?

33:29.060 --> 33:30.529
Didn't he do that?
Not the Feds?

33:30.596 --> 33:34.036
- Absolutely
- Absolutely. Not the Feds.

33:34.103 --> 33:36.073
Unbelievable.

33:38.645 --> 33:42.085
And we are not calling Father.
We're not doing that.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.793
No, no.

33:53.976 --> 33:57.550
Of course.

34:01.057 --> 34:02.794
That's what this is.

34:02.860 --> 34:05.198
That--this is a test!

34:05.265 --> 34:07.336
That was a test!

34:07.403 --> 34:09.239
Heavenly Father
is challenging us to--

34:09.306 --> 34:14.383
to create a better and bigger
newer practice together.

34:14.450 --> 34:17.623
It's just--that's all it is.
It's a test.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.262
That's what we're doing.
You're right, brother.

34:20.329 --> 34:21.531
I couldn't see it,
but you could.

34:21.598 --> 34:22.834
It's a challenge
from heavenly Father,

34:22.901 --> 34:25.806
and we're gonna meet it.

34:25.873 --> 34:27.510
- I'm surprised to hear
that your good family

34:27.576 --> 34:30.750
was in any kind of trouble.

34:30.816 --> 34:32.385
Did the brethren know?

34:34.122 --> 34:36.360
- No.

34:36.427 --> 34:38.799
We're Laffertys.
We circled our own wagons,

34:38.865 --> 34:40.101
shouldered the wheel.

34:40.168 --> 34:42.138
We just needed
a little more time

34:42.205 --> 34:45.713
to get around the hurdles--
namely, the U.S. government.

34:45.779 --> 34:48.484
So you go.

34:48.552 --> 34:51.390
- Something that starts with R.

34:51.457 --> 34:55.599
- R.
Something that starts with R.

34:55.666 --> 34:56.768
The radio.

34:56.835 --> 34:58.437
- Yep.
- All right.

35:01.210 --> 35:04.283
Okay, I spy with my little eye

35:04.350 --> 35:09.126
something that starts with T.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.896
- Uh--

35:10.963 --> 35:12.533
A tree.

35:16.575 --> 35:19.948
- Patriots for Freedom
was just helping us to navigate

35:20.015 --> 35:22.419
around our unjust tax burdens.

35:22.485 --> 35:23.855
- Trying to get
an extension or--

35:23.922 --> 35:27.564
No--by filing lawsuits
to relieve all citizens

35:27.631 --> 35:30.737
of these unconstitutional
federal taxes

35:30.803 --> 35:32.540
that must make
our founding fathers

35:32.607 --> 35:34.877
roll in their graves, Brother.

35:37.850 --> 35:39.788
- Were you expecting somebody?
- No.

35:39.854 --> 35:41.257
- No?

35:41.324 --> 35:43.829
Okay. Let's take a look.

35:47.035 --> 35:48.572
So why don't you stay
out here with the girls, huh?

35:48.639 --> 35:51.611
Yeah.
- Okay.

35:51.678 --> 35:55.753
- And we were making progress,
but the adversary

35:55.819 --> 35:57.322
was hard at work too.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.293
- Adversary
as in Satan's forces?

35:59.359 --> 36:01.030
Indeed.
- Mm-hmm.

36:01.096 --> 36:06.542
So Jimmy Carter,
socialism, haughty women

36:06.608 --> 36:10.448
who don't know their
rightful place,

36:10.516 --> 36:15.058
Gentile tax collectors who
invade our lives, our homes.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.042
- Hello!

36:24.109 --> 36:25.411
Hi.

36:27.382 --> 36:28.752
Hello.

36:28.819 --> 36:31.157
Are you Ammon Lafferty?
No.

36:31.224 --> 36:32.960
Who are you?

36:33.027 --> 36:35.732
We sent four notices,
including a notice to appear.

36:35.799 --> 36:38.337
It was signed for,
but we received no response.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.674
- I mean, they're bills
or what?

36:39.741 --> 36:40.809
Past due tax notices.

36:40.876 --> 36:42.012
- Tax notices?

36:42.079 --> 36:44.083
The ones I found
neatly arranged

36:44.150 --> 36:46.386
in your bill book there.
Mm-hmm.

36:46.453 --> 36:48.525
I've been ordered
to seize assets.

36:48.592 --> 36:52.032
So I need you to step outside
till I'm finished.

36:52.099 --> 36:54.704
- Seize assets?

36:54.771 --> 36:56.273
Hey.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.810
Okay, well, how about
we make a deal?

36:57.877 --> 37:01.450
How about I pay half now,
okay, and half later?

37:01.518 --> 37:03.922
How would that work?
Sorry, Charlie.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.058
That's not how this works.

37:05.124 --> 37:06.961
I need you to step outside.

37:09.233 --> 37:12.072
- Who said my name was Charlie?

37:12.138 --> 37:13.341
You didn't even ask my name.

37:13.408 --> 37:15.546
- Well, if your name
isn't Ammon,

37:15.613 --> 37:17.917
doesn't much matter
to me who you are.

37:17.984 --> 37:21.056
I got three of these today.
It's not personal.

37:21.123 --> 37:24.263
It's not personal?

37:24.330 --> 37:25.533
It's not personal?

37:25.600 --> 37:27.670
I am standing here

37:27.737 --> 37:31.511
looking at you in the eye,
man-to-man,

37:31.578 --> 37:33.414
and that ain't personal to you?

37:33.481 --> 37:35.620
Are you even from here?
- Connecticut.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.924
Just so you know, my partner
will be here any minute.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.694
Or I'm happy to call
the police back

37:39.761 --> 37:41.565
who lawfully let me in.
- No--no--let me finish!

37:41.632 --> 37:42.733
I'll have them remove you, sir.

37:42.800 --> 37:43.835
- Let me talk!

37:43.902 --> 37:45.405
Connecticut
can walk into my home

37:45.472 --> 37:48.210
and they can steal
my private property!

37:48.277 --> 37:50.649
You can just do that! Huh?

37:50.716 --> 37:52.553
Who the hell
do you think you are?

37:52.620 --> 37:54.891
- I'm empowered by
the United States government.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.594
That is who I am.

37:56.661 --> 37:57.830
Out!

38:03.676 --> 38:04.945
Get him outta here!
Where are you going?

38:05.011 --> 38:06.948
Who are you? Who are you?
Get out!

38:07.015 --> 38:08.719
Dan, come here, come here!

38:08.785 --> 38:10.154
Come on, Dan, sit down.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.625
- Get him out of my house!
- Sit down, sit down.

38:11.692 --> 38:13.862
It's all right. He's gone.
Take care of him! Now!

38:15.933 --> 38:18.706
- Matilda! Matilda!
Yes?

38:18.772 --> 38:20.576
Did a notice to appear
come in the mail?

38:20.643 --> 38:22.847
- You told me not to pay it.

38:22.913 --> 38:25.786
- So--so I listened
to the Holy Spirit for guidance

38:25.853 --> 38:27.657
and I asked him,
and he said, "Matilda,

38:27.724 --> 38:29.126
"you have to do as you're told

38:29.193 --> 38:30.896
"because Dan's plate is filled

38:30.963 --> 38:33.267
with a new and holy mission,"
just like you said, yes.

38:33.334 --> 38:34.804
- Oh, did you hear
him say that?

38:34.871 --> 38:36.340
- I did what he told me to.
- You hear the Spirit say that?

38:36.407 --> 38:37.710
He said--uh--

38:37.777 --> 38:39.179
I believe you.
I believe you.

38:39.246 --> 38:41.317
I believe you.

38:41.383 --> 38:43.789
He always speaks to you
so clearly.

38:43.856 --> 38:46.695
He's showing us
a more righteous path.

38:46.761 --> 38:49.600
Heavenly Father is showing us
a more righteous path.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.337
- And this means
that Brenda was right.

38:51.404 --> 38:52.673
She was right.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.477
I can hear him.

38:54.544 --> 38:55.980
I can hear him.

38:56.047 --> 38:59.721
So this--this Brenda
woman, she interfered?

38:59.787 --> 39:03.127
- The world seduces women
to abandon their virtue,

39:03.193 --> 39:09.406
and then their ambition grows
and spreads like a disease,

39:09.473 --> 39:11.678
distracting them
and those around them

39:11.744 --> 39:13.048
from their responsibilities.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.922
Yeah?

39:16.989 --> 39:18.257
- It's00, sir.

39:18.324 --> 39:19.927
No radio response.

39:19.994 --> 39:21.163
- Wh--what's wrong?

39:21.230 --> 39:22.466
- It's fine.

39:22.533 --> 39:28.578
- No, no, we should pray
together for guidance.

39:30.182 --> 39:31.585
Don't you think?

40:25.659 --> 40:28.197
- Come on out.

40:28.264 --> 40:29.600
I'm a policeman.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.036
I won't harm you.

40:47.469 --> 40:49.674
Stop! Freeze!

40:56.788 --> 40:58.257
Stop where you are!

40:58.324 --> 40:59.894
Ahh!

41:04.904 --> 41:07.643
Allen, I need to know,
did anyone in your family,

41:07.710 --> 41:11.284
anyone at all, object
to you marrying Brenda?

41:11.350 --> 41:16.728
- I mean, I--I don't have
to tell you what it'd be like

41:16.794 --> 41:19.233
to have a wife who's seen

41:19.300 --> 41:23.007
as interfering in men's affairs
in this valley.

41:23.074 --> 41:27.282
But my father's
old Mormon tales

41:27.349 --> 41:30.221
just fired her up more.

41:30.287 --> 41:32.659
You know, it's like she
wanted to be a Lafferty boy.

41:35.799 --> 41:37.469
All right, you crazy kids.

41:37.537 --> 41:39.741
That is all the time
we have for today.

41:39.808 --> 41:41.276
See you all on Tuesday.

41:43.047 --> 41:46.120
- Sir?
Hmm?

41:46.186 --> 41:48.224
- Why do you think people
in Salt Lake County

41:48.291 --> 41:51.564
wanna see men read our news
reports more than women?

41:53.033 --> 41:56.674
- The news is being written
by men and women these days,

41:56.741 --> 41:59.480
but the choice of host
is about finding

41:59.547 --> 42:01.149
an authority they'll trust.

42:01.216 --> 42:03.354
Wouldn't want your hard work
to be read by someone

42:03.421 --> 42:06.227
an audience isn't apt
to believe, now, would we?

42:06.293 --> 42:09.567
- Oh, my. Heck no.
No.

42:09.634 --> 42:12.105
- But I'm curious.
Hm?

42:12.171 --> 42:14.911
- You don't mind my curiosity,
do you, sir?

42:14.977 --> 42:19.085
- It is a critical part
of the job.

42:19.152 --> 42:23.895
- Who do you trust more:
men or women?

42:23.962 --> 42:28.505
- Oh, uh, people far higher up
make that decision here.

42:28.572 --> 42:33.581
But if you're asking me
personally and off the record,

42:33.648 --> 42:38.290
I see no difference.

42:38.357 --> 42:41.932
- Will you ask the higher-ups
why I can't be trusted?

42:41.998 --> 42:44.971
I mean, Jane Polly
hosts "The Today Show,"

42:45.038 --> 42:48.310
and people all over
find her trustworthy as heck.

42:50.749 --> 42:54.557
- All right.
Let's give it a try, shall we?

42:54.624 --> 42:56.260
- Now?
- Yeah, get on up there.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.462
- Yeah?
Yeah.

42:57.530 --> 43:00.468
- Okay. Okay.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.707
Let's push you right
in the deep end.

43:14.931 --> 43:17.135
Okay.

43:17.202 --> 43:19.072
Just grab the house lights.

43:21.444 --> 43:23.582
And camera.

43:23.649 --> 43:27.455
Ready? In three.

43:27.523 --> 43:30.896
- The once red-hot housing
market has begun to cool

43:30.962 --> 43:32.733
amid fears of looming
interest rate hikes

43:32.800 --> 43:34.470
by the federal government.

43:34.537 --> 43:37.341
Home sales have dropped nearly
15% in the first quarter,

43:37.408 --> 43:39.279
causing jitters
among local developers.

43:39.346 --> 43:41.450
- Nice.

43:41.518 --> 43:43.087
Good, good.

43:43.153 --> 43:45.659
Now...

43:45.726 --> 43:47.963
smile real big for me, Brenda.

43:52.272 --> 43:53.240
Hmm.

43:55.879 --> 43:58.785
Ah, you have
such beautiful teeth.

44:00.823 --> 44:03.728
- Oh, was my, uh--
my reading that bad?

44:03.795 --> 44:05.331
No. No.

44:05.397 --> 44:08.337
It was fine. It was fine.

44:08.403 --> 44:10.408
- Well, is that
good enough for you to ask

44:10.474 --> 44:16.020
if I can't at least fill in
if one of the boys gets sick?

44:16.086 --> 44:17.923
- One step at a time.

44:17.990 --> 44:21.665
Can't just jump
into the deep end.

44:21.731 --> 44:24.002
Can we, Brenda?

44:26.874 --> 44:29.514
- Can I ask you
another question?

44:29.581 --> 44:31.751
Do you lock yourself in here
with the boys, too,

44:31.818 --> 44:34.156
or just with the girls?

44:34.223 --> 44:36.026
Sister Wright, uh--

44:36.093 --> 44:37.128
I don't think
you understand--

44:37.195 --> 44:39.399
It was just a question.

44:39.466 --> 44:42.271
But one that gives me
renewed confidence

44:42.338 --> 44:45.445
you'll ask why only boys
do the news here.

44:45.512 --> 44:47.550
And if the higher-ups don't
give you a fair answer,

44:47.617 --> 44:50.755
you'll press them for one,
like good journalists do.

44:50.822 --> 44:52.859
- Because I'm also confident

44:52.926 --> 44:55.666
they'll find my question
about being locked in here

44:55.733 --> 45:00.241
alone with you
thought provoking.

45:00.308 --> 45:01.476
But I bet we both hope

45:01.544 --> 45:02.512
that can stay off the record.

45:10.294 --> 45:15.471
She wanted to build her
own kingdom and fight for it.

45:15.539 --> 45:17.543
Hey, sweetheart.
- Oh, hey.

45:17.610 --> 45:20.047
- How'd it go?

45:20.114 --> 45:23.053
See you next Tuesday
for the- 00 news.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.724
- Right.
- But, you know,

45:24.790 --> 45:28.765
our daddy never meant
for girls to keep building.

45:30.167 --> 45:31.671
- Did you tried to stop her?

45:31.737 --> 45:34.510
No, no.

45:36.647 --> 45:38.050
Oh, I loved that about her.

45:40.989 --> 45:42.826
Why, do you not approve
of women like that?

45:45.031 --> 45:47.268
- We're not here
to talk about me.

45:47.335 --> 45:48.738
It was just--
- Did your brothers

45:48.805 --> 45:50.809
try to stop her?
You know, it's not

45:50.876 --> 45:54.651
that extraordinary
for Mormons to,

45:54.717 --> 45:58.958
you know, make sure folks
were in their rightful place.

46:00.562 --> 46:05.973
Mormons, non-Mormons,
Blacks, whites,

46:06.040 --> 46:10.214
and men and women.

46:10.281 --> 46:12.485
Truly, they--you know, they all
have their rightful place

46:12.553 --> 46:14.255
in your kingdom of heaven,
don't they?

46:14.322 --> 46:16.092
Well, even if that
were true, Allen,

46:16.159 --> 46:19.232
a Latter-day Saint does not
kill someone

46:19.299 --> 46:21.671
for stepping out
of their rightful place.

46:21.738 --> 46:24.076
No?

46:24.142 --> 46:27.583
It's all over our history
and our scriptures.

46:36.366 --> 46:37.869
God told Nephi

46:37.936 --> 46:41.143
that it's better
for one man to perish

46:41.210 --> 46:45.050
than for a whole nation
to dwindle into unbelief.

46:47.288 --> 46:51.598
And if God commands it,
an obedient saint

46:51.664 --> 46:55.672
will exile, will steal...

46:55.739 --> 46:56.974
will kill.

47:04.590 --> 47:07.261
So she was too assertive
for your dad,

47:07.328 --> 47:11.370
she was too invasive for Robin,

47:11.436 --> 47:13.775
and she was too ambitious
for most of your family,

47:13.842 --> 47:19.554
and yet, you still thought
it wise to subject them

47:19.620 --> 47:23.861
to her invasions, eternally?

47:27.001 --> 47:32.411
- Well, Brenda wasn't
too anything for me.

47:32.478 --> 47:34.783
Utah is now facing
a double dip recession.

47:34.850 --> 47:37.589
As far away as Washington D.C.
may seem to some,

47:37.656 --> 47:39.827
the Capitol is breathing down
local shop owners'

47:39.894 --> 47:41.129
and builders' necks.

47:41.196 --> 47:42.699
And some say
the Federal Reserve

47:42.766 --> 47:44.737
is to blame for the
double-digit interest rates

47:44.803 --> 47:46.808
that have caused the freefall
in new construction.

47:46.875 --> 47:48.511
- She's so good, right?

47:50.749 --> 47:52.619
- Yeah, she gets
what she's after.

47:52.686 --> 47:55.091
- I wanted to marry her
from the very first moment

47:55.158 --> 47:57.696
I set eyes on her.

47:57.763 --> 48:00.536
My dad wanted that too.

48:00.602 --> 48:02.839
Can't get into
the celestial kingdom

48:02.906 --> 48:04.476
if you're single, right?

48:04.544 --> 48:06.413
You didn't--you didn't
marry her on day one, though.

48:06.480 --> 48:10.254
You--you waited.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.358
Something worried you?

48:12.424 --> 48:16.601
- Her bishop dad.
- Mm.

48:16.667 --> 48:19.774
And she wanted me to meet him

48:19.841 --> 48:21.810
before I popped the question.

48:26.186 --> 48:29.727
- Whoo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

48:29.793 --> 48:31.062
Larea, did you hear that?

48:31.129 --> 48:34.336
Beautiful.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

48:34.402 --> 48:37.041
Oh. Did you like that?
- Yeah.

48:37.107 --> 48:38.778
- Yeah, that was great, huh?

48:38.845 --> 48:41.049
Ugh, stock market, huh?

48:41.116 --> 48:43.019
- I'm sorry?

48:43.086 --> 48:44.557
- Making investments, huh?

48:44.623 --> 48:48.330
- Oh, uh, no, it's not
that kind of bears.

48:48.397 --> 48:50.869
A, uh, a brother gave it to me.

48:50.935 --> 48:53.541
It's a Christmas present.

48:53.608 --> 48:56.346
It's about how to beat
traffic tickets in court.

48:57.850 --> 48:59.920
- Sorry.

48:59.987 --> 49:02.693
- Get a--get a lot
of traffic tickets?

49:02.760 --> 49:07.469
- Well, uh, there are a lot of
speed traps in Utah nowadays.

49:07.536 --> 49:08.805
- Mm-hmm.

49:08.871 --> 49:11.710
- It just feels like the
government trying to make money

49:11.777 --> 49:13.113
more than public safety, right?

49:13.180 --> 49:16.019
- Yeah. Sure.

49:16.086 --> 49:18.457
I'm curious, Allen.

49:18.525 --> 49:22.231
Tell me, who would you say
runs things in your household?

49:22.298 --> 49:25.505
- Well, uh, my father's
the patriarch,

49:25.572 --> 49:27.208
and he--he keeps things
in line.

49:27.274 --> 49:28.611
- Yeah?
How does that work for you?

49:28.678 --> 49:32.284
The--the man of the house
running it all?

49:32.351 --> 49:34.790
- Well, you can't get far
in a leaky ship,

49:34.857 --> 49:36.259
and, uh,
it's the man of the house

49:36.326 --> 49:37.496
who keeps things shipshape,
right?

49:37.563 --> 49:38.798
- Well, I don't know
about that.

49:38.864 --> 49:41.537
I mean, girls seem to
have us boys outnumbered

49:41.604 --> 49:42.906
in this old house.

49:42.973 --> 49:44.877
Right, pal?
Can I go now?

49:44.943 --> 49:47.448
- You wanna go? Go ahead.

49:47.516 --> 49:49.853
- Ca--can I be excused, too,
sir?

49:49.920 --> 49:52.358
I promised your girls I'd, uh,
help 'em build their gliders.

49:52.424 --> 49:53.961
- Oh, they'll be fine.

49:54.028 --> 49:56.332
I taught my girls
how to build things.

49:56.399 --> 50:01.175
But I do admire a man
of his word, so go head up.

50:09.392 --> 50:14.001
- You know, after my folks
left, things got tougher.

50:14.068 --> 50:17.609
I started to see
a new door, you know,

50:17.676 --> 50:22.686
that maybe we could keep closer
to her roots than mine

50:22.752 --> 50:26.594
and stay away
from my family's pressures.

50:26.661 --> 50:28.029
I mean, ask anybody
in Salt Lake

50:28.096 --> 50:30.434
what it means to be a Lafferty.

50:30.502 --> 50:32.071
They all went on missions and--

50:32.138 --> 50:34.209
and started
their own businesses.

50:34.276 --> 50:36.548
And their family tree goes
way back to the pioneers.

50:36.614 --> 50:38.551
I mean, it's like
marrying into royalty.

50:38.618 --> 50:40.087
- Marry--he's asked you
to marry him?

50:40.154 --> 50:42.759
- Well, if that's what you're
so bent out of shape about, no.

50:42.826 --> 50:44.195
Not yet.

50:44.262 --> 50:47.769
- He does seem a bit
insubstantial for his age.

50:47.836 --> 50:50.508
- He's starting his
own tiling business.

50:50.575 --> 50:52.846
I mean, there's no end
in sight for tile, Dad.

50:52.912 --> 50:54.584
- Well, that's a whole lot more

50:54.650 --> 50:58.558
substantial than the boys
here in Idaho.

50:58.625 --> 51:00.128
- Hey, come here.

51:02.633 --> 51:06.072
You see there?
First star of the night.

51:06.139 --> 51:07.475
You reckon I can shoot it
out of the sky?

51:07.543 --> 51:09.546
- Yeah.
- Maybe, yeah.

51:09.613 --> 51:10.648
- Maybe?

51:10.715 --> 51:11.951
- Well, you heard him
say how he thought

51:12.018 --> 51:13.888
men ought to run things.

51:13.955 --> 51:17.963
Honey, he sounds a little
dusty to me, all right?

51:18.030 --> 51:19.232
It's the '80s now.

51:19.298 --> 51:20.769
I want you to use
your education.

51:20.836 --> 51:23.340
There's no reason you
shouldn't have a life too.

51:25.144 --> 51:26.714
- Get down.

51:29.886 --> 51:32.125
- I thought Betty would
get serious first.

51:32.191 --> 51:34.596
- Who the heck is gonna
marry Betty?

51:34.663 --> 51:36.332
In Argentina?

51:36.399 --> 51:38.203
I mean, she doesn't
even speak Spanish.

51:38.270 --> 51:42.211
I love him, and you're in here
making him say stupid things.

51:42.278 --> 51:45.217
- There's just something
inside me that says,

51:45.283 --> 51:47.288
"Just--just--just calm down.

51:47.355 --> 51:48.925
You know, wait and see."

51:55.137 --> 51:56.640
Jim?

52:01.316 --> 52:03.420
- For the love of Pete.

52:07.963 --> 52:09.199
I'm--I'm sorry!

52:09.265 --> 52:10.869
- I got it.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

52:10.936 --> 52:12.606
- I got the--Allen, step back.

52:19.586 --> 52:21.824
- I--I'm sorry, sir.
- It's out.

52:21.891 --> 52:23.494
Allen.

52:23.561 --> 52:27.168
Allen, why are you afraid of...

52:27.235 --> 52:30.675
Brenda going near
your own family?

52:38.090 --> 52:44.435
- You know, once, Ron got
this mutt for his birthday.

52:44.503 --> 52:47.441
Oh, gosh, he--
he loved that dog.

52:49.445 --> 52:53.220
And one day, my dad
came home from giving

52:53.287 --> 52:56.459
a blessing to a sick neighbor,

52:56.527 --> 53:00.200
and my brothers
hadn't done their chores.

53:00.267 --> 53:02.772
So he got us all
to stand in a circle.

53:04.576 --> 53:07.682
Then he called the dog
into the center.

53:09.452 --> 53:13.260
And he picked up Ron's own
baseball bat,

53:13.326 --> 53:14.730
the metal kind.

53:16.567 --> 53:18.436
And he beat that dog
to death...

53:20.976 --> 53:25.886
To teach us boys a lesson
about responsibility,

53:25.952 --> 53:28.824
about our rightful place.

53:30.728 --> 53:34.002
So what if this time, you know,
he comes home from his mission

53:34.068 --> 53:37.408
and decided that Brenda
needed to be taught a lesson

53:37.474 --> 53:39.546
about her rightful place?

53:41.951 --> 53:43.754
No.

53:47.095 --> 53:50.802
- Did any of your other
brothers' testimonies falter?

53:52.305 --> 53:54.275
Robin's or--

53:54.342 --> 53:55.678
- What is--what is with this?

53:55.745 --> 53:57.382
Why--why do you keep
asking about Robin?

53:57.448 --> 54:00.555
- I'm trying to find out
the kind of man

54:00.622 --> 54:03.059
that I'm--I'm looking for,
Allen, what his beliefs were,

54:03.126 --> 54:04.496
or what his interests are.

54:04.563 --> 54:11.175
- Robin was--is the most loyal
to the church.

54:11.242 --> 54:13.814
I mean, he--
he's a true believer.

54:13.881 --> 54:16.352
All right? That's Robin.

54:21.563 --> 54:23.366
- Are you certain that
the men who did this

54:23.433 --> 54:24.703
were all strangers?

54:30.147 --> 54:32.585
Is it possible that any
could have been family?

54:34.355 --> 54:36.325
- Certain?

54:38.831 --> 54:40.968
No.

54:41.035 --> 54:47.080
I can't ever be certain
about anything again.

54:51.524 --> 54:54.930
But I have learned
to live with doubt.

54:54.997 --> 54:56.032
Do you ever feel doubt?

54:56.099 --> 54:57.969
- I told you we're not
here to talk about me.

54:58.036 --> 54:59.940
- Now, things change
when you have kids.

55:00.007 --> 55:01.611
You know, and the things
you used to ignore,

55:01.677 --> 55:04.650
they get under your skin.

55:04.717 --> 55:06.553
Especially if you have girls.

55:06.620 --> 55:09.159
You want the best for 'em.

55:09.225 --> 55:12.599
And I could not see how
the best for my little girl

55:12.665 --> 55:14.670
was being caught up in a church
that would force her

55:14.736 --> 55:16.373
to make covenants
to obey all men

55:16.439 --> 55:18.409
for the rest of her life.

55:20.748 --> 55:22.384
Do you have daughters?
- Stop it. Stop it.

55:22.451 --> 55:24.856
Allen, stop!
I ask the questions.

55:26.927 --> 55:28.765
If you keep wasting
precious time,

55:28.832 --> 55:30.868
you're gonna find yourself
with an accessory charge.

55:32.438 --> 55:33.875
Understood?

55:42.792 --> 55:44.663
- Sorry.

55:47.602 --> 55:50.140
Really, I--I am. I am.

55:54.683 --> 55:56.987
I need you to try
to get some sleep.

55:57.054 --> 55:59.826
I'll be here for you
when you wake up.

55:59.893 --> 56:01.362
I promise.

56:36.867 --> 56:38.504
You called in
the Church Relief Society

56:38.571 --> 56:40.140
for a birthday party?

56:40.207 --> 56:42.513
You are in real trouble.

56:42.579 --> 56:43.982
- Ugh.
- But you're also

56:44.048 --> 56:45.952
the sweetest husband
in the world.

56:46.019 --> 56:48.958
I tell you what, we'll never
get through all this cake.

56:50.562 --> 56:51.697
- How's Mom handling
the racket?

56:51.764 --> 56:53.033
She's not awake yet.

56:53.100 --> 56:54.803
- We've got it all
in hand, Brother.

56:56.472 --> 56:59.011
Are, uh, are you still okay

56:59.078 --> 57:00.715
to meet
with the bishop tonight?

57:00.781 --> 57:02.719
- Oh, the girls'
baptism interview, of course.

57:02.785 --> 57:04.121
You know, I sure wish

57:04.188 --> 57:06.392
it was the only thing
on my mind, Becca,

57:06.459 --> 57:09.032
so I can be fully there for it.

57:09.098 --> 57:11.503
- It's- 30, sir.
- Um, honey, I'm so sorry.

57:11.570 --> 57:12.706
I've--I've really
gotta go right now.

57:12.772 --> 57:14.242
I love you so much, okay?

57:14.308 --> 57:15.779
Kiss the girls.

57:15.845 --> 57:18.651
- Okay. I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

57:18.717 --> 57:19.986
Call Forest Services.

57:20.053 --> 57:21.857
If they don't have eyes
on Taba, call County

57:21.924 --> 57:23.694
and get them to his last known,
pronto.

57:26.365 --> 57:30.274
Robin, I have men out there

57:30.340 --> 57:32.846
looking for your brothers
right now, so I need to know,

57:32.913 --> 57:36.019
are my officers in any danger?

57:36.085 --> 57:38.023
- Well, that depends,
Officer Pyre,

57:38.090 --> 57:40.762
on what they intend to do
to my brothers.

57:40.829 --> 57:44.468
- Officer,
not "brother" anymore.

57:44.536 --> 57:46.205
- Look, if your officers
are in any danger,

57:46.272 --> 57:48.210
then they only have
themselves to blame.

57:48.276 --> 57:52.518
The government came after us,
not the other way around.

57:52.585 --> 57:55.223
And when aggrieved and attacked

57:55.290 --> 58:00.769
time and again by the unjust
laws of Gentile lawmen...

58:02.906 --> 58:04.976
To the point
where our religion,

58:05.043 --> 58:08.851
our families, our freedom
is threatened...

58:08.917 --> 58:10.621
- Joseph!
Emma!

58:10.688 --> 58:12.157
Please, my child!

58:12.224 --> 58:13.895
Do we, the Lord's
covenant people,

58:13.961 --> 58:16.032
do we surrender our values?

58:16.099 --> 58:17.201
No!

58:19.772 --> 58:21.877
The "Prophet" Joseph Smith.

58:21.944 --> 58:23.146
Please, no!

58:25.952 --> 58:29.425
Leader of God's chosen people.

58:29.491 --> 58:32.732
Except now, we have a witness
to your crimes and whoredoms

58:32.799 --> 58:36.706
committed over and again
with an unmarried woman.

58:36.773 --> 58:42.619
Defiling your holy
marriage vows, Mr. Prophet.

58:42.685 --> 58:49.064
Now you face our law,
man's law, Ohio law.

58:49.131 --> 58:50.602
I'll grant you your concern.

58:50.668 --> 58:52.539
It cuts to the very heart
of the matter

58:52.605 --> 58:55.443
to what may soon
be the culmination

58:55.511 --> 59:00.487
of a centuries-old conflict
between His righteous people

59:00.555 --> 59:02.491
and a wicked state.

59:02.559 --> 59:09.305
Doctor, he may take your
tongue to stop your lies

59:09.371 --> 59:11.810
or clip your manhood
so you don't get the itch

59:11.877 --> 59:14.114
to commit such acts again.

59:14.181 --> 59:16.118
You choose, Prophet.

59:16.185 --> 59:19.225
- No!
No, you ungodly wretches!

59:19.292 --> 59:20.427
Do not touch him!

59:20.495 --> 59:22.532
- Once you've cut from me,

59:22.598 --> 59:25.771
I'll be made whole
in heaven again.

59:25.838 --> 59:28.977
But God will choose the
same portion of your flesh

59:29.044 --> 59:32.619
and burn it from you
for eternity.

59:40.601 --> 59:47.415
- If you wish to live,
gather your things and leave.

59:55.898 --> 59:58.604
Bring the tar
and feathers, then.

59:58.670 --> 1:00:01.743
- No! Joseph!
God will strike you down!

1:00:01.810 --> 1:00:05.751
- God's inspired laws
versus man's broken ones,

1:00:05.818 --> 1:00:08.824
for behold, the time is coming.

1:00:12.098 --> 1:00:15.671
And the original laws of God,

1:00:15.738 --> 1:00:17.909
revealed to our
founding fathers,

1:00:17.976 --> 1:00:20.814
must be delivered
from Babylon.

1:00:22.451 --> 1:00:26.192
Get out of Ohio!
You're not welcome!

1:00:34.609 --> 1:00:35.945
And nothing--

1:00:38.283 --> 1:00:42.826
Nothing can stop
the political kingdom of God

1:00:42.892 --> 1:00:45.698
from rising in glory.

1:00:54.883 --> 1:00:56.285
Hello?

1:00:57.989 --> 1:00:59.960
Is anyone home?

1:01:00.026 --> 1:01:04.268
So yes, your good officers,

1:01:04.335 --> 1:01:07.107
before they press any further,
I would urge them

1:01:07.174 --> 1:01:10.080
to consider
the words of our prophet:

1:01:10.146 --> 1:01:13.019
For if they resist us again,

1:01:13.085 --> 1:01:15.558
we will tread upon
the ashes of the wicked

1:01:15.625 --> 1:01:18.965
after they are destroyed
from the face of this earth.

1:01:19.031 --> 1:01:21.870
- So you killed her, then...

1:01:24.474 --> 1:01:27.649
For daring to resist you.

1:01:35.096 --> 1:01:36.465
- What do you mean?

1:01:43.814 --> 1:01:44.883
Who--who is that?

1:01:44.950 --> 1:01:46.318
Who--who else do you have
in here?

1:01:47.656 --> 1:01:48.925
Who is that?

1:01:48.991 --> 1:01:50.595
Hey! Answer me!

1:01:50.662 --> 1:01:51.797
- He--he woke up screaming,
sir.

1:01:51.864 --> 1:01:53.767
Allen!
