WEBVTT

00:00.748 --> 00:02.149
And now it's time

00:02.216 --> 00:04.718
for another episode
of <i>Mr. Bill's Safety Tips.</i>

00:05.853 --> 00:07.087
Oh, hey, everybody.

00:07.155 --> 00:09.823
Today we're gonna show you
some safety tips

00:09.891 --> 00:11.124
for around the kitchen.

00:11.192 --> 00:12.692
Now first,

00:12.760 --> 00:15.462
you should never leave
sharp objects lying around.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.964
You're right, Mr. Bill.

00:18.032 --> 00:19.900
I'm gonna put this away
right now.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.301
Good idea, Allison.

00:21.369 --> 00:24.504
No, wait! No! Oh! Oh!

00:27.074 --> 00:30.911
You know, things don't have
to be sharp to be unsafe.

00:30.978 --> 00:32.445
Like plastic bags.

00:32.512 --> 00:34.814
You can suffocate in one
of these.

00:34.882 --> 00:37.751
Say, Mr. Bill,
I couldn't finish lunch.

00:37.818 --> 00:39.920
You should
never be wasteful.

00:39.987 --> 00:41.054
That's right, Allison.

00:41.122 --> 00:42.422
It's never good to waste food,

00:42.490 --> 00:44.124
but, uh, hey,
I'm in here, and...

00:44.192 --> 00:47.827
No, wait! Don't do that!
I can't breathe! No!

00:50.198 --> 00:52.799
And finally, it's important

00:52.867 --> 00:55.769
to always turn the handles
of your pots inward

00:55.836 --> 00:58.505
so you don't knock them over
while cooking.

00:58.573 --> 01:01.208
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Bill.

01:01.275 --> 01:02.876
I'll take care
of that right now.

01:02.944 --> 01:04.811
Let's just get you out
of the way.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.346
Oh, no, Allison,
I'm catching on.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.715
I think you just want
to be mean to me.

01:08.783 --> 01:10.917
Why, what do you
mean, Mr. Bill?

01:10.985 --> 01:13.286
So you just leave me alone
right this minute.

01:13.354 --> 01:15.222
Mr. Bill, quit giving
me a hard time.

01:15.289 --> 01:17.324
No, wait! Oh! Oh!

01:22.230 --> 01:24.397
Allison?
Allison?

01:24.465 --> 01:26.866
You awake?

01:26.934 --> 01:29.135
The procedure went well.

01:29.203 --> 01:31.271
I was explaining
to your husband

01:31.339 --> 01:34.207
that, uh, your burns were
a little more severe

01:34.275 --> 01:35.575
than we initially thought.

01:35.643 --> 01:38.812
But the skin graft took
without any complications.

01:38.879 --> 01:40.480
Thank you.

01:40.548 --> 01:41.881
You're welcome.

01:41.949 --> 01:44.451
Now, we've performed
what's called an allograft.

01:44.518 --> 01:48.255
That means we've grafted
some healthy skin tissue

01:48.322 --> 01:51.057
we got from a donor
onto your burns.

01:51.125 --> 01:53.593
The healthy skin tissue
should promote healing.

01:53.661 --> 01:55.328
You'll feel some itching,

01:55.396 --> 01:57.130
maybe some discomfort
over the next few weeks.

01:57.198 --> 01:58.398
But in about a month

01:58.466 --> 02:00.233
you'll be almost
as good as new.

02:00.301 --> 02:01.635
I'll be releasing you

02:01.702 --> 02:04.871
as soon as the effects of
the anesthesia wear off.

02:04.939 --> 02:07.073
But tell me again
how it happened.

02:07.141 --> 02:11.278
Oh...
It was so stupid.

02:11.345 --> 02:13.346
I-I was cooking dinner.

02:13.414 --> 02:15.715
Then the phone rang,

02:15.783 --> 02:17.384
and I-I ran to get it,

02:17.451 --> 02:21.254
and I bumped my arm
into the handle

02:21.322 --> 02:23.023
of a pot of boiling water.

02:23.090 --> 02:25.558
That's why you're supposed
to turn those...

02:25.626 --> 02:26.793
...pot handles in.

03:17.548 --> 03:18.449
Okay, so it's
really late,

03:18.522 --> 03:20.457
so you just get in your
bedclothes, okay,

03:20.524 --> 03:22.525
and I'll take care
of everything in
the kitchen.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.560
You okay?

03:23.628 --> 03:24.628
Yeah, babe, I'm okay.

03:24.695 --> 03:27.197
Well, Marie already went to bed.

03:27.265 --> 03:30.700
And I cleaned up the kitchen.

03:30.768 --> 03:33.036
That's a lot of bandages.

03:33.104 --> 03:36.640
Okay, yow...

03:36.707 --> 03:39.175
All right, so Marie's got
a play date

03:39.243 --> 03:41.978
with, um...
Emily in the morning

03:42.046 --> 03:44.314
and Bridgette's got
soccer practice at 9:30.

03:44.382 --> 03:46.216
I just can't get over
how they make

03:46.284 --> 03:48.351
these team practices...
You okay?

03:48.419 --> 03:49.953
so early on Sundays
mornings.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.755
Well, she's in
middle school now,

03:51.822 --> 03:53.356
so it's time
for everyone

03:53.424 --> 03:57.027
to start taking sports
way too seriously.

03:57.094 --> 03:58.395
She's the equipment
manager,

03:58.462 --> 04:01.431
so if she doesn't bring
the cones and the balls

04:01.499 --> 04:03.166
and whatever else is
cluttering up

04:03.234 --> 04:04.334
our garage right now...

04:05.469 --> 04:07.804
It's okay. I'll take her.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.172
It's hard to believe

04:09.240 --> 04:11.741
that these skin grafts aren't
gonna leave a scar.

04:11.809 --> 04:15.712
I know. It's pretty amazing
how an allograft works.

04:15.780 --> 04:19.082
They count on the body's immune
system rejecting the donor skin.

04:19.149 --> 04:20.583
That's why there's no scar.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.852
It just has to stay on there
long enough

04:22.920 --> 04:25.021
to help the body heal.
It's all very efficient.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.790
Look at you.

04:26.857 --> 04:30.527
You look like a little boy
playing with a new train set.

04:30.594 --> 04:32.028
Well, okay, I'll admit it.

04:32.096 --> 04:34.064
I knocked over that pot
on purpose.

04:34.131 --> 04:35.565
I did it for you.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.100
You're the best.

04:37.168 --> 04:39.169
MAN
<i>Leave your name, your number,</i>

04:39.236 --> 04:41.538
and a brief message.
Thanks a lot.

04:41.605 --> 04:42.772
Hey, sweetie, it's Monica.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.508
I just wanted to tell you
that I wore the necklace

04:45.576 --> 04:47.310
you gave me
to the hospital today.

04:47.378 --> 04:49.913
Got compliments all day long.

04:49.981 --> 04:53.350
Everyone said the emerald's
beautiful.

04:53.417 --> 04:55.518
I love it, and I love you.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.320
Can't wait to see you.

04:57.388 --> 04:59.255
Bye.

05:37.895 --> 05:40.397
Kinda sounds like a
woman named Monica Janeway.

05:40.464 --> 05:42.866
She's a resident at Casa Valley
Memorial Hospital.

05:42.933 --> 05:44.200
According to the police report,

05:44.268 --> 05:46.069
she was believed to have been
forcibly abducted

05:46.137 --> 05:47.504
from her apartment
about a week ago.

05:47.571 --> 05:49.205
Yeah, I saw the man
who took her.

05:49.273 --> 05:50.640
Well, you want to meet me

05:50.708 --> 05:53.410
over at headquarters?
See if we can generate a sketch?

05:53.477 --> 05:54.711
Lee, it's Sunday.

05:54.779 --> 05:56.079
You're supposed to be
recuperating.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.180
Am I starting something?

05:57.248 --> 05:58.748
I don't want
to be starting anything.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.383
If you're supposed
to be resting...

06:00.451 --> 06:03.253
Nah. She just loves me and
that's her way of showing it.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.022
I'm just all bandaged up,
but I'm fine.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.690
Yeah, yeah,
well, me, too.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.659
Okay, two hours.
I'll see you there.

06:09.727 --> 06:11.995
I'll try and take a look
at the case file

06:12.063 --> 06:13.029
before you get there.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.431
Okay, see you
in two hours.

06:14.498 --> 06:16.332
All right, guys, here's your
snacks for your team.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.068
Gotta get ready.
Turn off the TV

06:18.135 --> 06:19.335
'cause you gotta be ready

06:19.403 --> 06:21.738
by the time Daddy comes
out of the shower.

06:26.744 --> 06:28.178
Hey...

06:56.707 --> 06:58.808
Okay, have fun. We'll see you in
a couple of hours, okay?

06:58.876 --> 07:00.210
All right. Bye, Dad.
Bye, sweetie.

07:00.311 --> 07:02.512
See you in a few hours.
All right.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.349
Excuse me.

07:06.417 --> 07:07.750
Are you Bridgette's dad?

07:07.818 --> 07:09.185
Hi. Yeah, I'm Joe Dubois.

07:09.253 --> 07:10.320
Hi.
Josh Whitman.

07:10.387 --> 07:11.721
This is my
daughter Hailey.
Hello, Hailey!

07:11.789 --> 07:13.490
This is my youngest, Marie.

07:13.557 --> 07:15.391
So where have you been
hiding that Bridgette?

07:15.459 --> 07:16.493
Excuse me?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.394
Bridgette.
She's quite the phenom.

07:18.462 --> 07:21.197
Oh, really?
You think so?
Yeah. Well,

07:21.265 --> 07:22.966
Hailey's my youngest.
Youngest of three.

07:23.033 --> 07:24.501
All my girls
played soccer.

07:24.568 --> 07:25.668
In all that time,

07:25.736 --> 07:27.504
Bridgette is the first
seventh grader

07:27.571 --> 07:29.205
I've ever seen start
for the team.

07:29.273 --> 07:31.007
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.576
Um, Bridgette's the equipment
manager, she's not a player.

07:33.644 --> 07:35.778
Well, that was
Bridgette Dubois

07:35.846 --> 07:38.181
that just walked away
from your car, right?

07:38.249 --> 07:39.349
Yeah.

07:39.416 --> 07:41.017
She's not just the
equipment manager.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.485
She's the starting goalie.

07:42.553 --> 07:44.821
And probably the best
player on the team.

07:49.793 --> 07:51.327
Hey, Bridge!

07:51.395 --> 07:52.428
Dad?

07:52.496 --> 07:55.365
Is something wrong?

07:55.432 --> 07:57.600
Uh, no, but are you...

07:57.668 --> 07:58.868
are you one
of the players?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.604
Yeah, I guess.

08:01.672 --> 08:03.773
You guess?

08:03.841 --> 08:07.877
Yeah. Well, uh... the girl
who played before me was goalie,

08:07.945 --> 08:09.579
she, uh, she hurt herself,

08:09.647 --> 08:12.215
so they put me out there
for practice,

08:12.283 --> 08:14.384
and, uh... I guess
I was pretty good.

08:14.451 --> 08:16.753
Wow!

08:16.820 --> 08:19.389
Yeah. Well, don't you have to go
drop Marie off at Emily's house?

08:19.456 --> 08:20.924
Yeah, in a minute.

08:20.991 --> 08:23.426
But Bridge, why didn't you tell
us that you were on the team?

08:23.494 --> 08:24.661
I don't understand.

08:24.728 --> 08:26.763
Your mom and I would love
to come watch you play.

08:26.830 --> 08:30.166
Well, that's kinda the reason
why I didn't tell you.

08:30.234 --> 08:33.336
I mean, I'd get nervous.

08:33.404 --> 08:36.972
There's really a lot of pressure
out there already,

08:37.041 --> 08:39.676
and some of the parents out
there, they take it

08:39.743 --> 08:42.477
really, really seriously.
But your mom and I
aren't like that.

08:42.546 --> 08:43.580
Bridgette!

08:43.647 --> 08:44.614
On the field.

08:44.682 --> 08:45.648
We're starting

08:45.716 --> 08:47.016
with penalty kicks
today.

08:47.084 --> 08:48.451
You're not mad, are you?

08:48.519 --> 08:49.886
No, no, I'm not mad.

08:49.954 --> 08:53.256
I just, I would just,
I'd love to watch you play.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.458
Dubois?

08:55.526 --> 08:56.526
It's okay.
Yeah. Go.

08:56.594 --> 09:00.263
We can't stay today, anyway.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.698
So this is the guy

09:01.765 --> 09:04.033
you saw break into her house
and Taser her?

09:04.101 --> 09:05.101
You sure?

09:05.169 --> 09:07.337
Positive.

09:07.404 --> 09:09.038
Hmm...

09:10.140 --> 09:11.307
I think he's already

09:11.375 --> 09:14.177
in the case file.

09:14.245 --> 09:17.347
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is him,
Doctor Heath Timlin.

09:17.414 --> 09:18.815
Now, he's the Chief Surgeon

09:18.882 --> 09:20.984
at the Transplant Surgery Center
at Casa Memorial--

09:21.051 --> 09:23.519
the same hospital
where Monica was a resident.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.564
This is him.
This is the man I dreamt about.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.566
Allison, this man, he's one

09:36.634 --> 09:38.901
of the top guys in his field,
you know?

09:38.969 --> 09:41.871
He's-He's not your, uh...
typical kidnapper.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.339
Well, does he have an alibi?

09:43.407 --> 09:45.141
Where was he the night
that she disappeared?

09:45.209 --> 09:47.777
At home. Lives alone.

09:49.913 --> 09:52.582
Okay, look, you saw
what you saw. I get it.

09:52.650 --> 09:54.684
Maybe sometime this week
if I have a couple minutes

09:54.752 --> 09:56.786
I'll personally take a second
look at Timlin, okay?

09:56.854 --> 09:59.589
I'll track him down. I'll ask
him some questions myself.

09:59.657 --> 10:03.326
But for the meantime,
hey, it's Sunday.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.596
What do you say
you and I get out of here?

10:08.499 --> 10:10.300
Allison?

10:11.902 --> 10:15.405
Allison, can I have
my arm back, please?

10:15.472 --> 10:18.241
I... I-I can't,
I swear to God.

10:18.309 --> 10:19.442
I'm not doing that.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.244
I swear to God,
I got two eyes.

10:21.312 --> 10:22.645
I can feel it on my arm.

10:22.713 --> 10:23.713
You absolutely are
doing this.

10:23.781 --> 10:24.714
Can you let go?

10:24.782 --> 10:26.649
I can't! It...

10:26.717 --> 10:31.087
It's like it doesn't
want you to leave.

10:32.489 --> 10:33.489
What the hell was that?

10:33.557 --> 10:36.192
I don't know,
I swear to you.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.295
It's like I lost
control of my hand.

10:45.502 --> 10:48.104
And the point
of this is...?

10:48.172 --> 10:50.039
I don't know.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.774
I'm not doing it.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.080
Look, what if I said maybe
I'll call the doctor today?

11:04.154 --> 11:07.590
I seem to have struck a nerve.

11:07.658 --> 11:10.660
But I swear, I'm as
bewildered as you are.

11:10.728 --> 11:13.763
You might want
to get that looked at.

11:21.145 --> 11:22.779
Make a fist for me.

11:22.847 --> 11:24.881
Then release.

11:24.949 --> 11:27.517
Hmm, I'm not sure what
to say, Mrs. Dubois.

11:27.585 --> 11:30.120
Your hand looks
just fine to me.

11:30.188 --> 11:32.455
Better than fine,
given your injury.

11:32.523 --> 11:36.526
Fine? I lost complete control
of this hand this afternoon.

11:36.594 --> 11:38.762
There are tests we can run
for that, if you like--

11:38.829 --> 11:40.864
EMG, nerve conduction--

11:40.932 --> 11:43.300
but I'm certain
that's not your problem.

11:43.367 --> 11:46.736
There's no numbness,
no sign of ulnar dysfunction.

11:46.804 --> 11:48.305
You have full
range of motion.

11:48.372 --> 11:51.942
Even the graft
is coming along nicely.

11:55.947 --> 11:59.382
Are you, uh, superstitious?

12:01.118 --> 12:02.552
Excuse me?

12:02.620 --> 12:04.321
I hope you're not
dwelling unduly

12:04.388 --> 12:06.690
on where the donated
material for your graft

12:06.757 --> 12:08.058
might have come from.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.726
What do you mean?

12:09.794 --> 12:11.127
Well, we talked
about this

12:11.195 --> 12:13.063
the night
of your procedure.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.532
I know you were in
a great deal of pain,

12:15.600 --> 12:18.301
but you and your husband
both indicated

12:18.369 --> 12:20.036
that you understood.

12:22.540 --> 12:26.009
You do recall that
your graft came

12:26.077 --> 12:28.211
from a deceased person,
don't you?

12:28.279 --> 12:29.946
No.

12:30.014 --> 12:33.683
Actually, I don't. But...

12:34.752 --> 12:38.321
I guess I do now.

12:38.389 --> 12:40.724
Wow.

12:40.791 --> 12:43.059
Hey. I called a cab.

12:43.127 --> 12:45.095
I got here as fast
as I could.

12:45.162 --> 12:46.563
So what happened?

12:46.631 --> 12:48.965
Why didn't the doctor want
you to drive yourself home?

12:49.033 --> 12:50.934
It's a long story.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.706
The skin graft came
from a dead person.

12:56.774 --> 12:57.841
So?

12:57.908 --> 13:00.243
So... I'm me.

13:00.311 --> 13:02.212
I see dead people.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.847
I talk to dead people.
Yeah.

13:03.914 --> 13:05.248
I dream about
dead people.

13:05.316 --> 13:06.316
Okay, and?

13:06.417 --> 13:08.818
And this hand and arm

13:08.886 --> 13:11.121
are starting to do things
of their own accord.

13:11.188 --> 13:13.790
Picking up things,
touching people,

13:13.858 --> 13:15.992
doing all kinds
of hand things

13:16.060 --> 13:17.994
without me even knowing
that they're doing it.

13:18.062 --> 13:19.829
Are you saying
your hand is possessed?

13:19.897 --> 13:21.131
It's not funny.

13:21.232 --> 13:22.465
It is a little funny.

13:22.533 --> 13:23.733
And what people
did you touch?

13:23.801 --> 13:26.169
Detective Scanlon.
I grabbed his arm.

13:26.237 --> 13:28.872
Okay, come on, wipe
the smile off your face.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.373
This is frightening.

13:30.441 --> 13:33.343
I mean, it's like my hand
has a mind of its own.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.512
I can't drive anymore.

13:35.579 --> 13:38.748
What if this skin came from
some kind of suicidal person?

13:38.816 --> 13:41.051
What if it came from
a great chef?

13:41.118 --> 13:43.586
What if it wants to steer me
into a tree or something?

13:43.654 --> 13:46.189
As opposed to making you
simply grab the arms

13:46.257 --> 13:48.591
of attractive men
in law enforcement?

13:48.659 --> 13:51.294
Allison, I don't know
how to participate

13:51.362 --> 13:53.129
in this conversation.
I just don't.

13:53.197 --> 13:55.899
I mean, look, the skin
on your arm is dead, okay?

13:55.966 --> 13:58.668
Now if you don't want
to drive, then that's fine.

13:58.736 --> 14:02.305
I can, you know, I can
do the driving for
the next few days

14:02.373 --> 14:04.808
until the graft on your arm
falls off, okay?

14:04.875 --> 14:06.443
We'll make it work.

14:07.878 --> 14:10.914
Now I need to talk
to you about Bridgette.

14:12.883 --> 14:14.551
Well, it's not
going to happen.

14:14.618 --> 14:17.120
She said she doesn't
want us at the game.

14:17.188 --> 14:19.456
She says it's
too much pressure.
She doesn't want us there?

14:19.523 --> 14:21.191
Why doesn't she
want us there?

14:21.258 --> 14:24.094
By the way, when did she
get the right to decide?

14:24.161 --> 14:25.929
I kind of understand it.

14:25.996 --> 14:27.697
I mean, she's on a streak.

14:27.765 --> 14:28.965
Her team's doing great.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.800
She doesn't want anything
to screw it up.

14:30.868 --> 14:33.570
How are we going to screw it up?
It's not like we're lunatics.

14:33.637 --> 14:36.773
It's not like we're
going to paint our faces
and curse at the refs.

14:36.841 --> 14:39.275
We just want to see our kid
do something she's good at.

14:39.343 --> 14:41.778
Well, of course, but if
she doesn't want us there...

14:41.846 --> 14:45.548
After I pick up Marie
from school tomorrow,
I'm going to the game.

14:45.616 --> 14:47.817
What?
There's two games
left in the season.

14:47.885 --> 14:50.186
If Bridgette's team
wins them both, then
they go to the playoffs.

14:50.254 --> 14:52.288
Tomorrow's the first game.
I'm going to the game.

14:52.356 --> 14:54.324
Joe.
I'm going to wait
till the game starts,

14:54.392 --> 14:55.592
and then I'm going
to sneak in.

14:55.659 --> 14:57.026
She'll never even
know I was there.

14:57.094 --> 15:00.363
Weren't you the one who just
said we're not lunatics?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.886
What the hell's
going on, Heath?

What's so important I
had to meet you here in
the middle of the night?

15:25.956 --> 15:29.692
We have a mutual problem.
Thought I'd make you
part of the solution.

disappearance.

He has an alibi?
Same as before.

16:45.970 --> 16:47.770
At home, alone.

16:47.838 --> 16:51.508
Listen, it's not a crime
to live by yourself.

16:51.575 --> 16:56.145
Look, he offered to let us
search his home, his office.

16:56.247 --> 16:58.014
He didn't act like
he was hiding anything.

16:58.082 --> 17:00.617
That's because he didn't take
her to his house or his office.

17:00.684 --> 17:02.385
I think the man that
Dr. Timlin met,

17:02.453 --> 17:04.420

his place of business.

He's some old soccer coach,
okay?

20:30.994 --> 20:34.130
I met him a few weeks ago, right
after our goalie got hurt.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.432
When tryouts came along, he
started telling me what to do.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.435
When I made the team,

20:39.503 --> 20:41.504
he kind of stuck around.

20:41.572 --> 20:45.374
And he's kind of been
coaching me ever since.

20:45.442 --> 20:47.744
Coaching you how?

20:47.811 --> 20:49.345
Well...

20:49.413 --> 20:52.648
He's been telling me
where the ball's going

20:52.716 --> 20:56.719
and where I have to be
to stop it.

20:56.787 --> 20:59.188
All right, well, that sure
sounds like cheating to me.

20:59.256 --> 21:02.558
Why? Just because I'm the only
person who can see him?

21:02.626 --> 21:05.228
Well, there's a lot of other
girls on our team

21:05.295 --> 21:07.063
who are taller than me.

21:07.131 --> 21:10.299
And they can kick a ball
farther than I can.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.401
And nobody calls that cheating.

21:12.469 --> 21:15.204
And then there's girls
that are faster than me.

21:15.272 --> 21:16.472
But that's fine.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.142
So why is it that the one
thing that I can do,

21:19.209 --> 21:21.344
that maybe other people can't,

21:21.411 --> 21:23.112
that thing
is called cheating?

21:23.180 --> 21:25.481
<i>I know you want me</i>
<i>to agree with you,</i>

21:25.549 --> 21:27.550

simple as all that.

21:27.618 --> 21:28.818
As all what?

21:28.886 --> 21:30.052
It's unfair.
It's cheating.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.921
Well, no, she's just using
what she's got,

21:31.989 --> 21:33.956
just like every other girl
on that team.

21:34.024 --> 21:35.091

21:35.159 --> 21:37.093
And you know, she is part
of that team.

21:37.161 --> 21:38.861
She's not just
carrying equipment.

21:38.929 --> 21:40.763

I'm not restraining it
while you've got grafts

21:49.406 --> 21:50.406
that are
still healing.

21:50.474 --> 21:52.542
What? So I'm supposed to just

21:52.609 --> 21:54.544
let my hand do
whatever it wants?

21:54.611 --> 21:56.045
I don't know.

21:56.113 --> 21:57.880
Well, fine.

21:57.948 --> 22:01.784
You should've seen that doctor
talking to Devalos today.

29:36.234 --> 29:38.168
She figured

29:38.236 --> 29:40.003
something was up.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.773
She was gonna report it.

29:42.841 --> 29:44.708

Dr. Timlin,

31:16.682 --> 31:18.183
he owns a tissue bank.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.285

to hospitals

31:20.352 --> 31:21.886
all over the Southwest.

31:21.954 --> 31:23.688

Lundgren

31:23.756 --> 31:27.258

at his funeral home...

31:27.326 --> 31:29.894
from people who aren't even
organ donors.

31:29.962 --> 31:31.763
Then Timlin fakes
the donation paperwork

31:31.830 --> 31:33.598
and sells the organs
on the open market.

31:33.666 --> 31:36.201
It's quite a story.

31:36.268 --> 31:37.535
Well, it gets better than that.

31:37.603 --> 31:40.038
When Monica Janeway figured out
what he was doing,

31:40.105 --> 31:42.574
Timlin murdered her,
then cut her up for parts.

31:42.641 --> 31:45.210
I wound up with a piece

in the high six figures.

31:49.481 --> 31:51.149

around dissecting people?

31:51.217 --> 31:53.017
What, rich people
don't want to be richer?

31:53.085 --> 31:54.752
Come on, the guy's been divorced
three times.

31:54.853 --> 31:56.387
That's a lot of alimony.

31:56.455 --> 31:59.624
Look, I'm telling you, I have
Dr. Janeway's skin on my arm.

31:59.692 --> 32:03.027
If we can prove that
my skin graft matches her DNA,

32:03.095 --> 32:04.796
and we can get
the hospital to verify

32:04.863 --> 32:06.898
that this skin came from
Dr. Timlin's tissue bank...

32:06.966 --> 32:08.733
Then the doctor
would have to explain

32:08.801 --> 32:11.202
how he came to sell the skin
of a missing woman.

32:11.270 --> 32:12.203
Got it.

32:12.271 --> 32:13.805
I'll run the test
right away.

32:13.872 --> 32:15.773
In the meantime, make sure
you have some officers

32:15.841 --> 32:18.476

home owner and Dr. Timlin.

32:18.544 --> 32:21.379

matches Monica Janeway's DNA,

I'll want them both
picked up right away.

32:23.282 --> 32:27.385

33:46.332 --> 33:48.700
We have 30 more minutes
to make a game of it.

33:48.767 --> 33:51.636
Let's go! Let's hustle!

33:55.507 --> 33:59.310
Hey, you okay, Bridge?

33:59.378 --> 34:02.080
You seem a little... off today.

34:02.147 --> 34:04.382
Yeah, it's just,

34:04.450 --> 34:07.185
I think I might have hurt
my knee.

34:07.252 --> 34:10.054
Maybe I should sit out
the rest of the game.

34:10.121 --> 34:12.824
Really?
You're in that much pain?

34:14.360 --> 34:16.694
Why don't you try
walking it off?

34:16.762 --> 34:18.663
See how you feel in ten minutes.

34:30.842 --> 34:31.976
Hey, Dubois...

34:32.043 --> 34:35.880
how you holding up?

34:35.947 --> 34:37.915
How am I holding up?

34:37.983 --> 34:38.983
Not so good.

34:39.051 --> 34:40.385
I can't believe

34:40.452 --> 34:42.887
that you gave me that whole
entire lecture yesterday

34:42.955 --> 34:44.922
about cheating.

34:44.989 --> 34:46.958
You!
The biggest cheater of all time.

34:47.025 --> 34:48.426
Why you say that?

34:48.494 --> 34:50.828
Just 'cause I didn't help you
for part of a game?

34:50.896 --> 34:51.829
Come on.

34:51.897 --> 34:53.231
I saw the sign.

34:53.297 --> 34:54.232
I get it now.

34:54.299 --> 34:56.000
That's your team.

34:56.068 --> 34:57.702
And this is your field.

34:57.770 --> 35:00.772
And the only reason you helped
me out in the first place is

35:00.839 --> 35:02.407
because you wanted to play
a team

35:02.474 --> 35:04.075
that you knew you could beat

35:04.143 --> 35:06.744
so that you'd be certain to go
to the championships.

35:06.812 --> 35:09.080
Well, wait a second.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.816
And the reason
you accepted my help?

35:11.884 --> 35:14.852
Wasn't it because you thought it
would make you a winner?

35:14.920 --> 35:16.721
Wasn't it because
you liked being popular?

35:16.789 --> 35:17.822
Liked having friends?

35:17.890 --> 35:20.258
How is that not cheating?

35:20.325 --> 35:23.528
Did you practice more
than everyone else?

35:23.595 --> 35:26.097
Did you spend
every moment after school

35:26.165 --> 35:27.165
honing your moves?

35:27.232 --> 35:28.299
Changing your diet?

35:28.367 --> 35:30.268
Exercising to improve your body?

35:30.335 --> 35:31.936
No, you did not.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.971
You let someone else tell you
what to do,

35:34.039 --> 35:36.107
and then you took

35:36.175 --> 35:39.210
the credit for it.

35:39.278 --> 35:41.913
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.615
Bridgette Dubois, you are a lazy
little girl who wants

35:44.683 --> 35:47.452
to be on a winning team,
but has no interest in doing

35:47.519 --> 35:49.454
any of the work
to make it happen.

35:49.521 --> 35:52.223
You're as phony
as that limp you used

35:52.291 --> 35:55.393
getting over here.

35:55.461 --> 36:00.665
My old team is going
to destroy you.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.669
Or destroy whoever
it is they end up
putting in

36:04.736 --> 36:07.238
to take your place.

36:07.306 --> 36:09.407
Now limp on back
to your bench

36:09.475 --> 36:12.643
and stop acting
like you've been wronged.

36:12.711 --> 36:14.278
You're going to get out
of this thing

36:14.313 --> 36:17.482
exactly what
you've put into it...

36:17.549 --> 36:18.716
nothing.

36:18.784 --> 36:20.718
Dubois, come on!
Let's take

36:20.786 --> 36:22.053
a look at that knee

36:22.120 --> 36:24.155
and figure out what we're doing
for the second half!

36:24.223 --> 36:26.123
I'll be right there.

36:29.194 --> 36:32.864
Thanks for giving me
the last word.

36:32.931 --> 36:36.534

I'm great.

37:26.385 --> 37:28.686

Hopefully, your sister will be
here by then.

Hey. Hello?

Hey. Ask me
how we did.

37:36.228 --> 37:37.461
How did you do?

37:37.529 --> 37:38.763
They killed us eight to two.

37:38.830 --> 37:39.764
Oh, no!

37:39.831 --> 37:41.632
Now ask me how I did?

37:41.700 --> 37:43.134
Okay. How'd you do?

37:43.201 --> 37:45.169
I never played
so hard in my life.

37:45.237 --> 37:46.704
It was great.

37:46.772 --> 37:47.738
It was awful.

37:47.806 --> 37:49.607
But it was great.

37:49.675 --> 37:51.275
I made a ton
of mistakes,

37:51.343 --> 37:54.512
but I put everything
I had into it.

37:54.580 --> 37:57.982
And I actually got
something out of it.

37:58.050 --> 37:59.750
Mistakes?
I'm confused.

37:59.818 --> 38:01.319
I didn't think
your friend the ghost

38:01.386 --> 38:02.520
let you make mistakes.

38:02.588 --> 38:06.290
Yeah, well, he decided
not to show up today.

38:06.358 --> 38:09.026
For me, anyways.
And I'm glad.

38:09.094 --> 38:11.028
And by the way,
next season?

38:11.096 --> 38:13.764
I'd love for you guys
to come to my games.

38:13.832 --> 38:15.032
You, too, Marie.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.068
Ooh.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.873
Hello?

38:22.941 --> 38:25.610
Allison, it's Manuel.
I thought you'd want to know

38:25.677 --> 38:28.479
that we have the preliminary
results back from the DNA test

38:28.547 --> 38:30.715
we ran on your skin graft
this morning.

38:30.782 --> 38:33.017
I'm sorry, but we're not getting
a match

38:33.085 --> 38:34.485
for Monica Janeway's DNA.

38:34.553 --> 38:35.886
What?

38:35.954 --> 38:38.189
Apparently ever since the graft
was applied to your arm,

38:38.256 --> 38:39.724
it's been mingling
with your own skin,

38:39.791 --> 38:41.892
and that's made it impossible
to obtain

38:41.960 --> 38:43.794
any sort of usable DNA
sample from the tissue.

38:43.862 --> 38:48.633
I'm sorry, but I thought
you'd want to know.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.034
Allison?

38:50.102 --> 38:53.104
No, no, it's okay.

38:53.171 --> 38:54.672
Thanks for calling.

38:56.108 --> 38:58.542
We're gonna have
to be careful with
this one, Doc.

38:58.610 --> 38:59.677
Right.
Of course.

38:59.745 --> 39:02.046
Got a long life ahead
of him, this one.

39:02.114 --> 39:03.648
No, you don't understand.

39:03.715 --> 39:04.882
We're not cremating this one.

39:04.950 --> 39:06.917
The family wants an open casket,

39:06.985 --> 39:08.386
and the viewing is tomorrow.

39:08.453 --> 39:10.921
So if you take too much tissue
from him, they'll notice.

39:10.989 --> 39:12.356
Relax, Wayne.

39:12.424 --> 39:14.725
I'm only gonna take skin and
bone from below the waist.

39:14.793 --> 39:17.261
No one's gonna be
any the wiser.

39:24.970 --> 39:28.739
<i>We reached out to the family of</i>
<i>the man you dreamt about.</i>

39:28.807 --> 39:30.341
His name was Norman Kent.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.109
When we told his widow that

39:32.177 --> 39:33.511
we suspected her
late husband had

39:33.578 --> 39:35.680
been a victim of Lundgren
and Timlin's scheme,

39:35.747 --> 39:37.815
she gave us permission
to exhume his corpse.

39:37.883 --> 39:39.650
No sooner had the medical
examiner removed

39:39.718 --> 39:42.186
Mr. Kent's pants than she
discovered a significant amount

39:42.254 --> 39:43.554
of skin tissue was missing.

39:43.622 --> 39:45.456
In addition, the bones

39:45.524 --> 39:48.159
of his hips and legs
had been replaced

39:48.226 --> 39:49.727
with common PVC piping.

39:49.795 --> 39:51.462
<i>We confronted Lundgren</i>
<i>with the evidence,</i>

39:51.530 --> 39:53.130
<i>and he copped</i>
<i>to the scam right away.</i>

39:53.198 --> 39:55.433
We're picking up Dr. Timlin
as we speak.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.835
Well, good.
So they're both under arrest

39:57.903 --> 39:59.670
or they will be.

39:59.738 --> 40:02.206
Well, they're both under arrest
for conspiring to sell organs.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.275
But Lundgren didn't admit
to killing Monica Janeway.

40:04.342 --> 40:05.710
And there's still nothing
concrete

40:05.777 --> 40:06.777
tying her to either man.

40:06.845 --> 40:08.145
I don't understand.

40:08.213 --> 40:10.448
They're just gonna get away with
chopping her to pieces?

40:10.549 --> 40:14.185
They'll each do jail time for
their role in the organ scam.

40:14.252 --> 40:17.021
But at this point, it's
a very real possibility

40:17.089 --> 40:18.622
that they'll never be held
accountable

of Dr. Janeway.
