So come and get... it?

00:05.163 --> 00:06.201
Who am I kidding?

00:06.203 --> 00:08.770
I can't remember the first time we met.

00:08.979 --> 00:10.874
Or the second.

00:13.070 --> 00:16.171
Never drink anything unless
you know what's in it.

00:17.031 --> 00:21.546
I loved your magic fingers
and your c-c-cunni...

00:21.679 --> 00:24.429
Oi! Oi, oi, oi.

00:27.586 --> 00:30.486
It says Cunninglufugus.

00:30.718 --> 00:32.664
He's one of Snuffleupagus' friends.

00:32.756 --> 00:34.343
- I've never heard of him.
- Yeah.

00:34.382 --> 00:37.453
Well, he doesn't come
out all that often.

00:37.578 --> 00:40.664
But trust me, he is a fan favorite.

00:40.734 --> 00:43.664
You shouldn't even be
writing your own letters.

00:45.226 --> 00:46.640
Why do you say that?

00:46.710 --> 00:48.226
If you were really a princess,

00:48.312 --> 00:51.093
the Royal Scrivener
would write them for you.

00:51.304 --> 00:54.343
For your information, this
is a very personal letter.

00:54.468 --> 00:57.453
It's very important that
I write it myself, okay.

01:01.009 --> 01:03.076
Do I have a Royal Scrivener?

01:04.266 --> 01:06.531
- You don't even know?
- No.

01:06.677 --> 01:09.311
You're so not the real princess.

01:16.191 --> 01:19.281
Good morning, Your Majesty.
Big day ahead of us.

01:19.408 --> 01:21.375
DNA results are due this evening

01:21.454 --> 01:23.798
but, before that, you
have a lunch with...

01:24.439 --> 01:26.648
- Yeah, go on.
- Change of plan.

01:26.691 --> 01:29.023
We need to get you back
into bed immediately.

01:29.441 --> 01:31.474
Is that never speaking of it again?

01:31.562 --> 01:34.523
The country needs you at
your best, so does the Palace.

01:34.612 --> 01:37.234
Unless you're okay with
King Cyrus taking over.

01:37.328 --> 01:40.187
I believe he's currently
in the Red State Room

01:40.279 --> 01:42.145
knighting a prostitute.

01:43.335 --> 01:45.843
- You can't be serious?
- I thank you

01:45.976 --> 01:50.699
for your loyal services
to the crown and I...

01:50.842 --> 01:55.955
knight thee Dame Sinnamon

01:56.122 --> 02:00.804
of South East something, or whatever.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.195
Actually, Your Majesty, I
changed my name to Saffron.

02:05.294 --> 02:07.265
It's the most expensive spice.

02:07.402 --> 02:09.406
Too late, I already said Sinnamon.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.960
Well, then, as the
newest lady of the court,

02:12.044 --> 02:14.187
how may I serve Your Majesty?

02:14.313 --> 02:16.991
Does the great sword need a polish?

02:18.295 --> 02:21.232
You're too
late for that as well.

Do you know why he called me Sparrow?

Yeah, because you were his baby brother.

He said you were so

I spent a lot of time

Did you ever think about me?

No. You were Robert's brother.

No. My dad hosts a group

- No.

06:42.995 --> 06:47.493
They just meet up and talk once a week.

something to you, too.

06:57.393 --> 06:59.127
- How do you mean?
- Well...

06:59.181 --> 07:01.578
you've been through a lot, Liam.

07:03.073 --> 07:06.476
It might help to talk about it.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.797
Hi, Foxy.

07:21.361 --> 07:24.456
Your little person was in
my room again this morning.

07:24.534 --> 07:26.573
Oh, sorry. I'll tell
her she isn't allowed.

07:26.674 --> 07:29.581
No, it's fine, actually.
I'm teaching her things.

07:29.674 --> 07:31.002
I'll tell her she isn't allowed.

07:31.049 --> 07:35.346
Listen, I've figured out a
way that you can repay me...

07:35.838 --> 07:38.140
for my baby-sitting services.

07:38.518 --> 07:40.940
I need you to be my Royal Scrivener.

07:41.065 --> 07:45.638
See, Jasper recently wrote
me the most beautiful letter.

07:46.479 --> 07:47.580
Oh.

07:47.643 --> 07:50.685
So, really, I need your
help writing one to him.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.478
You know the two of
us better than anyone.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.432
You've never written to him before?

07:55.526 --> 07:57.716
Only texts.

07:58.085 --> 08:00.185
Let me just...

08:01.463 --> 08:02.621
Here we go.

08:02.737 --> 08:04.518
It looks like some sort of code.

08:04.591 --> 08:07.159
- They're emojis.
- Right.

08:07.213 --> 08:09.261
Read text to Jasper.

08:09.407 --> 08:11.698
'Sunglasses + pistol + wine

08:11.723 --> 08:14.056
gives Princess a pulsating heart.'

08:14.184 --> 08:18.728
There's no emoji for Jasper, so
I chose sunglasses and a pistol.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.120
Oh, and I was drinking, of course.

08:21.556 --> 08:24.384
It's not perfect, but you
do get the point, don't you?

08:24.618 --> 08:26.118
It's very sweet.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.647
'I want your banana in my honey pot.'

08:28.720 --> 08:30.541
Yes, I was gonna go
with taco there, but...

08:30.543 --> 08:33.143
- I thought it was a bit...
- Please. No more.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.597
- Will you help me?
- For the sake of letter writing

08:37.735 --> 08:39.438
and literature in general,
I can't let this go on.

08:39.494 --> 08:41.563
So, yes, I'll help you.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.003
- Yay! Thank you.
- 'Eggplant.'

08:43.028 --> 08:44.886
Oh, dear. Sorry!

08:44.973 --> 08:46.627
Sorry, Foxy.

08:47.050 --> 08:48.235
Come on, people.

08:48.292 --> 08:51.501
Quit your lollygagging
and move your asses.

08:51.829 --> 08:53.071
What's going on?

08:53.149 --> 08:55.454
I don't know how it happened,
but we just found out that

08:55.517 --> 08:57.173
the Prince of England's coming today.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.177
The guys are gonna lose their minds.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.970
- Prince Liam?
- Of course Prince Liam.

09:02.134 --> 09:04.103
Do you know another Prince of England?

09:04.814 --> 09:06.151
Let's go, everybody. Tick-tock.

09:06.181 --> 09:08.657
Come on. We've got a
prince to prepare for.

09:08.978 --> 09:10.522
Please tell me you've got
another change of clothes.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.155
Good morning to you, too, Angie.

09:12.249 --> 09:13.923
- What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
- I don't know.

09:13.948 --> 09:15.103
Is frumpy the new black?

09:15.129 --> 09:17.499
At least dad has one
daughter who's still trying.

09:17.608 --> 09:20.014
Not everyone dresses like
they're going to the ball.

09:20.132 --> 09:22.985
- Or The Box.
- Well, maybe they should.

09:23.069 --> 09:26.764
It's not every day you get to meet
the world's most eligible bachelor.

09:28.546 --> 09:29.968
'Piss off!

09:30.061 --> 09:33.345
You never understand my
royal decrees. I hate you!'

09:33.397 --> 09:36.129
'I'm not
even real. How can you hate me?'

09:36.218 --> 09:37.522
'Gunther!'

09:38.343 --> 09:40.986
I can't believe she
screamed at me like that.

09:41.045 --> 09:42.171
'The nerve of her.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.075
- He's terrible.
- I'm the Crown...'

09:44.208 --> 09:45.694
Oh, I think he's wonderful.

09:45.819 --> 09:49.291
He knows what he wants and he'll
do anything he can to get it.

09:49.511 --> 09:51.409
I respect that.

09:52.741 --> 09:54.574
Phone down.

09:55.406 --> 09:56.655
Plenty of fluids.

09:56.757 --> 09:58.814
Doctor's orders.

10:00.859 --> 10:02.094
'Gunther!'

10:08.430 --> 10:11.506
In England, we give out
plaques for almost anything.

10:11.688 --> 10:13.418
The other day, I presented
a plaque for the street

10:13.493 --> 10:14.993
that had the most cobbled stones.

10:16.688 --> 10:20.492
But it's nice to see that, in some
places, plaques aren't just for show.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.368
This is one of those places.

10:22.571 --> 10:25.867
Not just because it's full of great
beer, though that doesn't hurt,

10:26.305 --> 10:28.008
but because it's full of great people.

10:28.068 --> 10:31.469
My brother recognized that a year
ago when he met Captain Laurence.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.568
Thank you for your service.

10:33.727 --> 10:37.309
He loved the United Kingdom
and he loved its people.

10:37.563 --> 10:41.376
As I look around, I
see him in each of you.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.376
Great people doing great things.

10:45.419 --> 10:48.286
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

10:58.663 --> 11:00.648
Wonderful speech, Your Highness.

11:00.782 --> 11:03.406
I do hope everything is to your liking.

11:03.578 --> 11:05.278
It certainly is.

11:07.956 --> 11:09.555
It's good to see you again.

11:09.976 --> 11:12.444
I believe you served me
when I was here last year.

11:13.742 --> 11:16.851
Oh, yes, of course, Your Highness.

11:17.429 --> 11:19.335
It's so kind of you to remember.

11:19.476 --> 11:22.109
I could never forget the Pub Princess.

11:26.309 --> 11:29.815
Why aren't you being open
about your relationship with Kathryn?

11:30.028 --> 11:31.785
I'm next in line for the throne.

11:31.853 --> 11:33.668
I don't get the same luxuries as you.

11:33.721 --> 11:35.388
I can't party with
my friends every night

11:35.465 --> 11:37.856
or publicly snog whoever I fancy.

11:40.403 --> 11:42.214
Kathryn's not just anyone.

11:42.403 --> 11:43.684
If she was my girl, I wouldn't hide her.

11:43.777 --> 11:45.097
Your girl?

11:45.317 --> 11:47.137
Have you thought about
that a lot, little bruv?

11:47.224 --> 11:49.101
I'll tell you what. Let's
bet on the next game.

11:49.215 --> 11:51.879
You beat me, you have my
blessings to ask her out.

11:51.934 --> 11:53.340
You'd let her go like that?

11:53.442 --> 11:57.465
Well, we'll never know
because you can't beat me.

11:59.692 --> 12:00.957
I'm joking.

12:01.015 --> 12:03.638
I wouldn't be with Kathryn
unless I cared for her.

12:04.082 --> 12:08.749
But the cold, hard truth is
that I'm a royal, she's not.

12:10.023 --> 12:13.502
- That shouldn't matter.
- It shouldn't, but it does.

12:13.832 --> 12:16.731
There's a lot of expectation
on the next King of England.

12:16.981 --> 12:19.999
Consider yourself lucky you
don't have to worry about it.

12:20.278 --> 12:23.441
Frankly, I'm envious of you.

12:28.238 --> 12:30.766
'You're not spoiled, if you're royaled.'

12:31.909 --> 12:33.832
It's true. It's true.

12:36.153 --> 12:38.613
- Who was it?
- You're blocking the telly.

12:42.953 --> 12:44.403
A word?

12:45.809 --> 12:48.257
Walk away, everyone, please.

12:49.926 --> 12:52.621
They should at least stand when I enter.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.162
I am the King, you know.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.778
Yeah, for now. What do you want?

12:55.824 --> 12:58.099
That wasn't Violet in
the garden, so who was it?

12:58.101 --> 13:01.002
Are you sure we only
stole one of your balls?

13:03.551 --> 13:06.372
It was just some girl we found
working at the fishmonger.

13:06.621 --> 13:08.817
You might say we'd "Gone fishin'".

13:08.878 --> 13:11.905
Now walk away, I'm trying to watch this.

13:14.741 --> 13:15.950
Spoiler alert.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.957
Gunther brings him ice cream that's
too cold and he moans about it.

13:20.051 --> 13:23.188
'It's too cold! Gunther, I hate you!'

13:23.293 --> 13:25.616
You ruined it! Get out!

13:33.790 --> 13:35.118
I'd say you've got some big bollocks,

13:35.157 --> 13:37.282
but I know you got
them blown off in Basra.

13:37.391 --> 13:39.790
That was my ass
that got shot in Basra.

13:39.891 --> 13:42.559
My bollocks I lost to
a hooker in Fallujah.

13:42.630 --> 13:44.430
Rosie, I didn't know
you were in Fallujah.

13:44.477 --> 13:46.196
Well, you lost your own goddamn arm.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.079
I wouldn't expect you
to keep track of me.

13:50.389 --> 13:53.227
Sorry, Your Highness,
if we're being too crass.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.907
I've got a mouth on me like a sailor

13:55.006 --> 13:57.440
with his mouth on another sailor.

13:57.751 --> 13:59.536
Please, you should hear
the way my brother and I

13:59.538 --> 14:00.704
used to speak to each other.

14:00.813 --> 14:02.665
See? He gets it. We're all brothers.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.372
Even you, Rosie. Our
ugly little brother.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.420
- To brothers in arms.
- Brothers in arms.

14:08.422 --> 14:10.956
And of course to brother in arm.

14:16.243 --> 14:19.198
What happened, if I may ask?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.394
I was on a recon mission.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.850
My mate stepped on an IED.

14:27.282 --> 14:31.201
Killed him instantly
and blew half my arm off.

14:31.652 --> 14:34.068
The pain was like
nothing I'd felt before.

14:35.293 --> 14:38.084
I wanted to just give in to it.

14:39.082 --> 14:41.355
But you found the strength to survive.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.222
It wasn't strength.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.071
It was the thought of my girl back home.

14:49.082 --> 14:51.300
If I didn't make it back
alive, she'd have kicked my ass.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.148
Now she just has to wipe it.

14:55.892 --> 14:57.140
Cheers.

14:58.182 --> 14:59.515
Cheers.

15:16.668 --> 15:18.785
Remember that letter you
helped me write to Eleanor?

15:18.863 --> 15:20.027
Not really.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.832
But I do remember the letter
I completely wrote for you.

15:22.897 --> 15:25.410
Now's not the time to
argue. I just got one back.

15:26.371 --> 15:27.636
It's amazing.

15:27.736 --> 15:30.347
Oh, it can't be that good.

15:31.457 --> 15:33.660
Oh, but then again...

15:33.715 --> 15:35.472
See, I told you it's good.

15:35.566 --> 15:36.879
I believe you said "amazing".

15:36.933 --> 15:38.675
It is, but it's just this one part.

15:38.761 --> 15:40.368
Which part?

15:41.082 --> 15:43.849
The part about "a heart so true."

15:44.035 --> 15:45.042
What's wrong with that?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.699
I don't know. Nothing,
it's just a little girly.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.769
Just because it's sensitive
doesn't mean it's girly.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.488
The hearts of men and
women love the same.

15:57.816 --> 16:01.767
Nice! Nice! Give me more like that.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.110
Wahey!

16:11.112 --> 16:14.304
Oh, like I care about your
fantasy cricket league.

16:14.382 --> 16:16.539
- Well, you should, I'm kicking ass.
- Oh, yeah?

16:16.601 --> 16:18.195
Why are you in such a good mood?

16:18.329 --> 16:19.861
Because of you.

16:20.190 --> 16:23.838
Seriously, thank you for convincing
me to give Jasper another chance.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.471
If it weren't for you, we
wouldn't be together now.

16:26.588 --> 16:27.846
What's the point of being a brother

16:27.890 --> 16:30.908
if you can't hook your
sister up with your bodyguard?

16:32.989 --> 16:34.855
That's creepy.

16:35.133 --> 16:37.433
Oh, I thought you were Jasper.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.143
Looks like you have some competition.

16:40.181 --> 16:43.486
Tell me about it. This is Sara Alice.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.645
Sara Alice, this is my
brother, Prince Liam.

16:46.791 --> 16:48.760
You don't look like a prince.

16:48.876 --> 16:50.885
She says that a lot.
Don't pay attention to her.

16:50.971 --> 16:54.002
I wasn't going to. Bye, Sara Alice.

16:54.159 --> 16:55.960
Bye, Not Jasper.

16:56.097 --> 16:58.190
Have you seen our boyfriend anywhere?

16:58.503 --> 17:00.021
My boyfriend.

17:00.117 --> 17:01.785
I might know where he is.

17:01.901 --> 17:04.182
Ooh. Wonderful.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.865
How can her hair be dark as a mountain,

17:06.909 --> 17:08.737
but bright as the sun?
It doesn't make sense.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.521
It doesn't have to make
perfect sense. It's poetic.

17:11.546 --> 17:14.540
Well, there's a fine line
between poetic and pathetic.

17:14.963 --> 17:16.854
There certainly is.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.058
'My dearest Eleanor...'

17:26.219 --> 17:27.551
Eleanor?

17:29.565 --> 17:31.311
We're breaking up!

17:31.842 --> 17:33.213
I don't blame you.

17:37.081 --> 17:39.257
It doesn't even sound like you.

17:41.380 --> 17:42.967
Well, that's quite nice.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.502
Thank you.

17:46.925 --> 17:48.615
How could you?

17:49.620 --> 17:52.067
These letters were
supposed to be between us...

17:53.136 --> 17:54.602
not us.

17:54.886 --> 17:57.636
How could you both
betray my trust like that?

17:57.737 --> 17:58.979
I beg your pardon, Princess,

17:59.005 --> 18:01.808
but... you had me write
your letter as well.

18:02.003 --> 18:03.495
This is not about me.

18:03.550 --> 18:07.686
Oh, wait, wait, wait. You
didn't write that letter?

18:08.428 --> 18:10.661
So you don't think I have
the body of a Greek God?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.210
No, no.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.491
But James does.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.446
Well, thank you, James.

18:23.479 --> 18:26.620
You can't be mad at me. You
did exactly the same thing.

18:26.692 --> 18:29.151
That's the point, though, isn't it?

18:29.268 --> 18:30.768
We can't do anything right.

18:30.870 --> 18:34.841
Our relationship started with
my blackout and your blackmail.

18:34.866 --> 18:36.901
I thought the letters could
be a new beginning for us.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.956
I mean, how hard must it be

18:38.982 --> 18:41.628
to write a few stupid
sentences about how we feel?

18:41.847 --> 18:44.087
I didn't know what to say. I'm...

18:44.548 --> 18:45.886
I'm not a letter writer.

18:45.939 --> 18:50.967
I guess maybe we just don't get
each other like I hoped we did.

18:53.753 --> 18:55.791
You know we do.

18:59.913 --> 19:01.879
I know James does.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.623
Knock knock.

19:09.097 --> 19:10.483
Willow.

19:10.597 --> 19:12.177
Good to see you.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.333
You too.

19:15.176 --> 19:16.989
Why are you so happy?

19:17.063 --> 19:18.317
Wait...

19:18.403 --> 19:20.458
What did the pill that
Eleanor gave you look like?

19:20.531 --> 19:23.286
No pills. Just happy you're here.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.528
I've been wanting to ask you something.

19:25.561 --> 19:27.012
Ask away.

19:27.192 --> 19:29.395
I want to start a
charity for wounded vets,

19:29.497 --> 19:31.614
help them get their lives back on track.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.215
Can you help with that?

19:33.309 --> 19:36.372
I can. What gave you the idea?

19:36.505 --> 19:37.989
I want to honor Robert.

19:38.098 --> 19:40.739
Brilliant. I'll make some calls.

19:40.794 --> 19:42.818
It's great to see you happy again.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.224
- I like this version of you.
- Me, too.

19:45.704 --> 19:49.904
Hey, did erm... Madden ever talk to you?

19:49.952 --> 19:55.005
He... he asked if I was
okay with him asking you out.

19:55.287 --> 19:57.427
And what did you say?

19:57.568 --> 20:00.603
I told him you're out of his
league, but that he should.

20:00.943 --> 20:04.969
He did, but I don't know if it's
a friend thing, or another thing.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.122
It's a "whatever you
want it to be" thing.

20:07.263 --> 20:09.376
You should give him a chance.

20:09.493 --> 20:11.654
Well... you're not the boss of me, so...

20:11.698 --> 20:13.771
Actually, I kind of am now.

20:15.138 --> 20:17.802
I just want you to be happy.
I like that version of you.

20:17.914 --> 20:20.257
I'll think about it.

20:26.082 --> 20:29.787
How did I fall for such an obvious ploy?

20:29.956 --> 20:32.201
You don't have her eyes,

20:32.375 --> 20:36.034
her nose, her ass.

20:36.909 --> 20:41.779
But, I suppose, with
the right alterations...

20:42.537 --> 20:44.324
you could pass for her.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.117
Pass for who?

20:46.693 --> 20:49.615
I was in love with a girl who looked...

20:50.185 --> 20:52.080
kind of like you.

20:52.826 --> 20:54.692
Then, one day, she was gone.

20:55.318 --> 20:57.118
Now I have a problem.

20:57.622 --> 20:58.904
Down there.

20:59.005 --> 21:02.813
And I need your help
straightening it out, so to speak.

21:04.512 --> 21:07.615
You want me to pretend
to be another girl

21:07.716 --> 21:10.241
so your willy can work again?

21:10.396 --> 21:12.238
I wouldn't have been so vulgar about it

21:12.263 --> 21:14.582
but, yes, that's the idea.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.801
Why would I do that?

21:17.872 --> 21:20.084
Because your King requested it.

21:20.242 --> 21:21.836
If that's not reason enough,

21:21.921 --> 21:24.844
I could always have you
locked away for treason.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.869
I don't think so.

21:30.238 --> 21:32.539
Or I could pay you.

21:33.599 --> 21:35.263
You loved her?

21:35.601 --> 21:37.435
I did, yes.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.280
Fine.

21:44.076 --> 21:46.014
I'll do it for love.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.580
And twice as much money.

21:51.350 --> 21:52.616
Deal.

21:55.827 --> 21:57.621
Your hands smell like cheese.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.423
Didn't I tell you to use scented soap

21:59.449 --> 22:01.468
- for these occasions?
- Apologies, my Liege.

22:01.527 --> 22:04.725
Apologies will not remove
rotten cheese smell from my nose.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.126
What is this?

22:09.702 --> 22:13.370
An extremely rare Highland stallion
from the sire line of Damascus,

22:13.684 --> 22:15.613
bred especially for Your Highness.

22:15.989 --> 22:18.231
'Eurgh! It's brown.

22:18.309 --> 22:21.089
Everyone has a brown
horse. It's so common!

22:21.262 --> 22:23.145
Does he think I'm a common boy?

22:23.254 --> 22:24.362
I'm not a common boy!

22:24.387 --> 22:27.289
I'm the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein!'

22:27.353 --> 22:29.086
What a little jerk.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.989
Why can't boys ever be happy
with what's given to them?

22:32.106 --> 22:34.302
He's not just a boy, he's a prince.

22:34.372 --> 22:36.293
They have to have higher standards.

22:36.598 --> 22:40.223
'He never says
thank you. Not even once.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.161
I'm quite sure he doesn't even
know the meaning of the word.

22:44.434 --> 22:45.814
Uh, this better be important.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.786
Prince Hansel's about to
try on his new slippers.

22:47.879 --> 22:49.440
I bet he doesn't like them.

22:49.559 --> 22:51.442
The results are in, Your Majesty.

22:59.752 --> 23:01.514
I got so carried away
with all that nonsense,

23:01.539 --> 23:03.687
I forgot how important this day was.

23:03.997 --> 23:05.656
That was sort of the
point, Your Majesty,

23:05.747 --> 23:08.198
to take your mind off your worries.

23:08.302 --> 23:11.115
It's one of the main
reasons people watch rubbish.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.213
Regardless of who their father is,

23:20.432 --> 23:22.540
you'll always be their mother.

23:22.705 --> 23:25.376
No one can take that
away from you, or them.

23:25.893 --> 23:29.281
Thank you, Spencer, for
taking care of me today.

23:29.635 --> 23:31.966
It's been my pleasure, Your Majesty.

23:48.244 --> 23:49.815
I used to hate when she yelled at us,

23:49.877 --> 23:52.239
but... not talking is worse.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.672
Much worse.

23:59.035 --> 24:01.650
I need to tell you what I've
been up to this last week.

24:03.712 --> 24:06.083
I've had your DNA tested again.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.886
We were able to get hold
of Cyrus's DNA from his...

24:15.103 --> 24:18.642
Well, it doesn't matter where
we got it, but it's done.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.282
That tests have proven,
without a doubt...

24:24.159 --> 24:27.527
that Simon is your biological father...

24:29.855 --> 24:33.423
and I'm your mother, but you know that.

24:34.593 --> 24:36.977
I always knew he was our father.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.540
I'm so sorry.

24:38.704 --> 24:40.110
You don't need to apologize.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.258
- She doesn't?
- I do.

24:42.422 --> 24:45.512
The previous tests weren't
a mistake by the lab.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.581
Your blood was never tested.

24:48.204 --> 24:49.313
It was all a scheme.

24:49.441 --> 24:53.345
A lie invented by me...

24:53.458 --> 24:55.136
and Cyrus...

24:55.907 --> 24:58.595
and I'm so ashamed of it now and...

24:58.661 --> 25:00.911
what I put you through, both of you.

25:01.013 --> 25:03.688
You still don't think
she needs to apologize?

25:06.732 --> 25:08.765
You've made it right.

25:12.038 --> 25:13.905
It's done now.

25:20.087 --> 25:22.120
I know why you made that deal.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.282
You didn't believe in me.

25:26.083 --> 25:29.158
Honestly, I didn't believe
in myself back then either.

25:30.634 --> 25:32.806
But I need you to believe in me now.

25:33.217 --> 25:34.516
I do.

25:34.943 --> 25:37.711
I was going to ask if
you were ready to be King,

25:38.025 --> 25:40.263
because there's no going back

25:40.323 --> 25:43.998
but I can see, without
a doubt, that you are.

25:57.842 --> 25:59.217
I must schedule a press conference

25:59.289 --> 26:01.790
so we can tell our
news to all of England.

26:02.287 --> 26:04.514
Eleanor, is there
anything you want to add?

26:24.985 --> 26:27.797
No, not that way. More maid-like.

26:31.431 --> 26:33.680
Less maid-like.

26:33.771 --> 26:35.508
Never mind.

26:35.610 --> 26:38.863
Go and get the pomegranate
juice and tell me to drink it.

26:39.151 --> 26:40.500
Drink the pomegranate juice.

26:40.561 --> 26:42.188
No. I don't want to.

26:42.297 --> 26:43.774
- Oh.
- No!

26:43.852 --> 26:45.328
You need to force me to drink it.

26:45.399 --> 26:47.157
Well, how do you suggest I do that?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.394
Demand that I drink it.

26:50.999 --> 26:53.152
Drink the pomegranate juice.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.111
Now.

27:01.196 --> 27:03.114
Say cruciferous.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.442
Cruciferous.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.354
Whisper it. Be sexy.

27:10.049 --> 27:11.994
Cruciferous.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.168
You can leave now.

27:20.617 --> 27:22.767
Should I leave in a specific way, or...?

27:22.817 --> 27:25.238
No. Just go. We're finished.

27:29.152 --> 27:30.855
I'm finished.

27:34.907 --> 27:38.561
You must have really loved her
if you're still like this now.

27:40.017 --> 27:42.986
One of these days, you'll find
someone like that to love again

27:43.133 --> 27:44.666
and that'll fix everything.

27:45.212 --> 27:47.946
I'll keep that in mind, fish lady.

27:56.939 --> 27:59.119
Your mom just told me the good news.

27:59.174 --> 28:00.720
Congratulations.

28:00.770 --> 28:03.908
I mean, congratulations, Your Majesty.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.514
Stop. Stop. Thank you.

28:07.372 --> 28:09.739
You believed I could be
King before anyone else.

28:09.934 --> 28:11.775
Before even I did.

28:12.184 --> 28:15.091
It meant the world to me. It still does.

28:15.183 --> 28:17.380
Of course. We should celebrate.

28:17.484 --> 28:20.036
We should, but I can't right now.

28:20.114 --> 28:21.591
I have... something.

28:21.668 --> 28:24.379
- Another time?
- Seriously?

28:24.523 --> 28:26.456
What could be more important than this?

28:26.614 --> 28:28.681
Hot date?

28:30.578 --> 28:32.245
Oh.

28:32.559 --> 28:34.357
I'm sorry, I...

28:34.748 --> 28:36.674
I should have told
you about her earlier.

28:37.865 --> 28:42.639
So that's the reason you've
been in such a good mood.

28:42.927 --> 28:44.568
There's nothing to be sorry about.

28:44.649 --> 28:49.246
Have a good time and
congratulations, truly.

28:51.226 --> 28:53.093
Thank you, Willow.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.026
For everything.

29:17.310 --> 29:18.521
Are we still friends?

29:18.610 --> 29:21.029
Yeah. I'd rather marry a prince anyway.

29:21.103 --> 29:22.570
Yeah. Who wouldn't?

29:22.638 --> 29:25.419
Come on. You know you're not supposed
to be playing in the Princess's room.

29:25.517 --> 29:27.984
I don't think she's a princess.

29:29.185 --> 29:32.091
- Why do you say that?
- She doesn't act like one.

29:32.242 --> 29:34.373
So what are princesses
supposed to act like?

29:34.482 --> 29:38.693
They're supposed to dance and
sing and act pretty for the ball.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.069
Well, I've seen her dance and sing

29:41.216 --> 29:42.748
and she always looks pretty.

29:42.896 --> 29:47.732
They also ride in carriages and brush
their hair and wait to be rescued.

29:47.906 --> 29:50.880
She doesn't even own a tiara or a brush.

29:50.989 --> 29:53.060
However is she going to find a prince?

29:53.138 --> 29:56.155
Yeah, but you know those
are just fairy tales.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.966
When I think of a real princess,

29:58.024 --> 29:59.524
I always think of Eleanor.

30:00.558 --> 30:03.888
A real princess doesn't
need fancy dresses or jewels

30:04.022 --> 30:05.825
and she definitely
doesn't need to be rescued.

30:05.923 --> 30:08.788
That's what Eleanor is,
she's a real princess.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.388
She does what she wants,

30:11.556 --> 30:13.435
and she's always true to herself,

30:13.599 --> 30:15.665
despite what anybody else thinks.

30:15.872 --> 30:18.401
That's... that's why people love her.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.317
Who's not
supposed to be in my room?

30:21.395 --> 30:22.919
Sorry!

30:30.084 --> 30:31.536
Sorry.

30:32.105 --> 30:34.106
You can stay.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.243
So I guess you're not mad at me anymore?

30:45.929 --> 30:48.894
I do what I want, and right now...

30:49.029 --> 30:51.094
I want to do this.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.371
Don't ever doubt your words
again. They're perfect.

30:54.464 --> 30:56.222
Just believe in them.

31:01.157 --> 31:02.911
I wanted this.

31:02.936 --> 31:04.708
I want you...

31:04.858 --> 31:06.739
and only you.

31:08.453 --> 31:10.645
Now take off your clothes.

31:11.051 --> 31:12.958
Well said.

31:14.621 --> 31:16.074
Cyrus.

31:22.378 --> 31:25.196
I just wanted to return...

31:25.386 --> 31:28.478
what was left of your testicle.

31:28.712 --> 31:32.845
If there's a God, your
Botox will backfire.

31:32.993 --> 31:34.993
Oh, there's a God

31:35.095 --> 31:39.732
but, unfortunately for
you, she's Team Helena.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.845
The DNA tests came in today

31:41.973 --> 31:44.722
and they prove what
we've known all along.

31:44.920 --> 31:49.454
So knight every pimp, drug dealer
and hooker in Great Britain.

31:49.587 --> 31:51.931
Bounce around in your huge gerbil ball,

31:52.099 --> 31:54.728
or have a huge gerbil
bounce around in you.

31:54.853 --> 31:57.204
Makes no difference. Because very soon,

31:57.333 --> 31:58.884
everyone will know the truth,

31:58.923 --> 32:02.614
and your reign... will be over.

32:06.079 --> 32:08.313
This is your last night as King.

32:08.691 --> 32:10.691
Enjoy it.

32:14.104 --> 32:16.938
I hope you feel it someday.

32:17.555 --> 32:21.316
What it's like to lose
something so great.

32:22.177 --> 32:24.386
To have it taken from you...

32:25.462 --> 32:27.113
Alistair.

32:27.204 --> 32:28.570
Simon.

32:28.983 --> 32:30.441
Robert.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.441
I've lost more than my share.

32:34.518 --> 32:36.718
But you know what they say,

32:37.478 --> 32:40.886

34:01.323 --> 34:03.023
It's not like we're breaking up.

34:03.926 --> 34:06.111
Yeah, well, you can't
break up with someone

34:06.136 --> 34:07.933
that you've never officially dated.

34:08.051 --> 34:10.815
Come on. You've always known
the reality of our situation.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.715
I've never hidden anything from you.

34:12.847 --> 34:15.647
No. You've only hidden me.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.675
I'm sorry.

34:21.513 --> 34:23.125
I'm sorry.

34:23.801 --> 34:25.706
It's just frustrating.

34:25.847 --> 34:27.308
We can't even take a picture together

34:27.380 --> 34:29.047
because you're afraid it might get out.

34:29.355 --> 34:31.551
Do you think that's what I want?

34:32.222 --> 34:34.034
I-I don't know.

34:36.051 --> 34:37.972
What do you want?

34:41.277 --> 34:45.043
Sorry to interrupt. We need to go.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.469
Do you mind taking a
picture of us, Sparrow?

34:55.608 --> 34:57.296

I just found out King
Simon was my father.

35:54.617 --> 35:56.889
My father was King Simon.

35:57.087 --> 35:59.570
My dad is my dad...

36:00.095 --> 36:01.550
officially.

36:02.265 --> 36:04.571
- Holy shit.
- Well said.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.595
I know I should be excited
but, between you and me,

36:06.743 --> 36:09.540
I'm... kind of freaking out right now.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.570
Well, you're gonna be King of
England. You're allowed to freak out.

36:16.009 --> 36:19.812
I guess... things are
gonna change for you now.

36:20.648 --> 36:22.392
No.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.993
Everything...

36:26.619 --> 36:29.882
is going to change for us.

36:54.142 --> 36:56.368
"My breathtaking Princess.

36:56.657 --> 37:00.219
"I'm watching you sleep,
but not in a creepy way.

37:00.774 --> 37:03.607
Well, not entirely creepy."

37:10.350 --> 37:12.576
There was a time when
that would have worried me.

37:13.034 --> 37:14.376
What?

37:14.492 --> 37:16.587
You looking happy.

37:16.781 --> 37:19.568
You know, there's a time where
you wouldn't have noticed.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.873
Mm.

37:22.110 --> 37:25.945
I hope you know my apology
earlier was for you as well.

37:26.615 --> 37:28.448
I put you through a lot last year,

37:28.716 --> 37:31.818
what with the DNA fiasco and...

37:32.086 --> 37:33.990
that whole Jasper thing.

37:37.244 --> 37:41.333
I've decided to pretend
that that never happened.

37:41.825 --> 37:44.333
Maybe you could do the same.

37:49.570 --> 37:52.605
That is incredibly gracious of you.

37:53.181 --> 37:55.840
I know what it's like
to get my father back.

37:56.657 --> 37:59.373
You should know what it's
like to get your children back.

38:00.971 --> 38:02.551
I love you.

38:03.784 --> 38:05.239
I love you.

38:08.759 --> 38:11.724
Now, then, Liam is going to be
dealing with a lot very soon.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.032
He's gonna need his
sister more than ever.

38:13.095 --> 38:14.593
I'm not going anywhere.

38:14.735 --> 38:16.985
Good. I have such a sense of optimism.

38:17.024 --> 38:19.509
Everything is exactly as it should be.
