14:29.785 --> 14:31.495
Only it wasn't just that one time.

14:35.332 --> 14:40.546
I told myself any... parent
with my power would do the same.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.049
[scoffs] That it wasn't wrong.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.594
I just had an advantage.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.391
I mean, from the time I was little,
I used it to get everything I wanted.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.185
-Mm-hmm.
-With Dad, with my career...

14:57.771 --> 14:58.606
[sighs]

14:59.356 --> 15:01.609
But now, I know nothing
in my life was real.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.778
So I'm starting over.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.866
[sighs]
I just didn't think it would be so hard.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.492
It'll get easier.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.288
-Some things just take time.
-Yeah.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.750
And some things just stay broken.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.215
[indistinct chatter]

15:37.144 --> 15:39.063
You're still lookin' for Mr. Puddles.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.778
I-- I got out of rehearsal and was
in the neighborhood, so I thought...

15:46.320 --> 15:48.280
-I--
-Came all the way to Bricktown?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.493
Well, since you're here,

15:53.243 --> 15:54.703
you might as well come in.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.872
[keys jingle]

15:57.706 --> 15:58.540
[door unlocks]

16:07.925 --> 16:10.761
-[Vanya] These are beautiful.
-[Leonard] Ah, thank you.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.638
Restoration antiques.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.473
It's my bread and butter.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.936
But I do play around with other things.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.479
Like what?

16:21.563 --> 16:22.648
Oh...

16:23.899 --> 16:24.775
I don't know.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.111
It's kind of embarrassing.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.488
Come on.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.797
-[Vanya] You made all these?
-When I was a kid,

16:47.423 --> 16:49.842
my imagination was my escape.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.512
And, clearly, I never grew up.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.432
No, it's amazing.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.143
Which one is your favorite?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.437
Ballerina is kind of my best.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.397
Or maybe the duck.

17:03.647 --> 17:04.565
Or the other duck.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.108
Or the other duck.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.443
[chuckles]

17:11.071 --> 17:12.698
But there is one you should see.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.419
-Is that...?
-[Leonard] Okay, so I might have...

17:25.919 --> 17:27.921
stayed up last night making this.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.590
Wow.
It's beautiful.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.345
Thank you. Take it.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.222
Oh, no. I...

17:37.598 --> 17:39.266
I insist. Please.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.976
I made it for you.
You inspired me.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.824
This is so bizarre.
We've known each other for... two days?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.076
I feel like you know me better

17:57.159 --> 17:59.661
-than anyone in my family.
-[chuckles] Hey.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.791
This might be a little inappropriate,
seeing as I'm your...

18:04.374 --> 18:06.960
impressionable young student, but...

18:08.629 --> 18:11.131
would you want to have dinner
with me tonight?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.385
You don't have to if you don't want to.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.303
-Yeah.
-[Leonard] It's fast...

18:16.386 --> 18:18.305
-No, I--
-...I know, but...

18:18.388 --> 18:19.306
I'd like that.

18:19.973 --> 18:20.808
Yeah?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.354
-[Vanya] Allison?
-Hey.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.274
Leonard, this is my sister, Allison.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.236
Wait a second, I know you.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.114
You were in that movie.
You're in the movie, the...

18:35.197 --> 18:36.198
You were the lawyer.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.033
The tough one in the wheelchair, right?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.910
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, that was me.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.246
You didn't tell me your sister
was a movie star.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.747
Wow!

18:44.581 --> 18:46.917
You were in that Umbrella thing, too,
weren't you?

18:48.544 --> 18:49.878
But you weren't in that, were you?

18:50.671 --> 18:54.258
No, uh... I was sort of the fifth Beatle
of the family, so...

18:54.550 --> 18:57.845
I never really did like the Beatles.
More of a Stones guy, myself.

19:00.597 --> 19:04.393
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt, but,
uh... could you come back to the house?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.396
-We're having a family meeting.
-And you guys want me there?

19:07.479 --> 19:08.522
Of course.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.860
It's about Mom.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.072
-I'm so sorry. I--
-Oh, don't be.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.616
We'll do a rain check on dinner.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.077
-Bye.
-Thanks.
[Leonard] Yeah.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.999
Who's the guy?

19:27.708 --> 19:31.503
-[Vanya] He's a... just a friend.
-Friend?

19:32.796 --> 19:33.755
No, it's not...

19:35.883 --> 19:38.802
Maybe I'm just trying
to not separate myself

19:38.886 --> 19:40.179
from everything and everyone.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.058
I'm... I'm sorry.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.312
I shouldn't have said
those things to you yesterday.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.606
I was angry with Patrick, and I...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.149
I took it out on you.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.692
I'm really sorry.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.068
I'm, uh...

19:55.944 --> 19:58.197
I'm not good at this whole sister thing.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.073
I hadn't noticed.
Ouch.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.910
Tell me how you really feel.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.038
-Maybe I will.
-[Allison laughs] Okay!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.555
[sighs]

20:25.140 --> 20:27.601
-[boy] Kick it over here!
-[children laughing]

20:29.770 --> 20:31.104
[boy echoing] Whoa!

20:47.079 --> 20:47.913
[echoing] No!
[Luther] <i>Five.</i>

20:52.459 --> 20:53.293
<i>Five!</i>

20:54.002 --> 20:55.045
<i>-Hey, Five.</i>
-[knocking]

20:55.128 --> 20:56.088
No!

20:56.171 --> 20:57.005
[Luther] Five!

20:59.383 --> 21:01.510
What are you... [muttering]

21:02.761 --> 21:04.471
Oh, my God... [grunts]

21:06.807 --> 21:08.558
[panting]

21:09.726 --> 21:11.603
-You okay?
-You shouldn't be...

21:12.229 --> 21:13.355
How did you find me?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.065
[Luther] Um...

21:16.024 --> 21:17.818
Hey, baby...

21:17.901 --> 21:21.238
Hey, a little privacy, guys.
We're really hitting it off back here.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.657
-[screams]
-Get out! You can't be here!

21:24.241 --> 21:25.492
I'm in the middle of something.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.954
-Any luck finding your one-eyed man?
-[whispers] No.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.415
-What's he talkin' about?
-Does it matter? It's Klaus.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.292
[Five sighs]

21:33.750 --> 21:34.918
What do you want, Luther?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.170
Um...

21:37.254 --> 21:39.840
So, Grace may have had something to do
with Dad's death.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.719
So I need you to come back to the academy,
all right? It's important.

21:44.720 --> 21:48.098
"It's important."
You have no concept of what's important.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.016
Hey!

21:49.099 --> 21:53.312
Did I ever tell you guys about the time
I waxed my ass with chocolate pudding?

21:53.770 --> 21:55.647
[laughs]

21:55.731 --> 21:58.525
-It was so painful.
-What are you still doing here?

21:58.608 --> 21:59.860
-Ay, ay, ay...
-What?

21:59.943 --> 22:02.654
I-- What? I need an excuse to hang out
with my family?

22:02.738 --> 22:04.406
We're trying to have
a serious conversation.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.367
What, and I'm incapable of being serious?
Is that what you're saying?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.536
-Luther's got a point, you should get out.
-What?

22:13.790 --> 22:14.708
Fine!

22:17.502 --> 22:20.422
-[Luther] What the hell are you up to?
-[Five] You wouldn't understand.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.884
Try me. Last I checked,
I'm still the leader of this family.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.428
Well, last I checked,
I'm 28 years older than you.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.683
-You know what your problem is?
-Really hoping you'll tell me.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.393
You think you're better than us.

22:35.145 --> 22:38.190
You always have. Even when we were kids.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.441
[sighs]

22:40.859 --> 22:43.653
But the truth is, you're just as messed up
as the rest of us.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.156
We're all you have.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.450
And you know it.

22:49.659 --> 22:53.205
I don't <i>think</i> that I'm better than you,
Number One.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.374
I <i>know </i>I am.

22:55.957 --> 22:56.958
[chuckles]

22:57.501 --> 23:01.463
I've done unimaginable things,
things you couldn't even comprehend.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.381
Right.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.217
Just to get back here and save you all.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.386
-[shop bell rings]
-Whoo!

23:07.469 --> 23:08.929
-[man] Stop!
-[grunts]

23:09.012 --> 23:10.889
Hey! Stop right now!

23:11.390 --> 23:13.392
-[Klaus] Hey, bitches!
-[whistle blowing]

23:15.268 --> 23:16.978
-[man] You, get back here!
-[tires screech]

23:17.062 --> 23:18.230
[Klaus] Out of the way, asshole!

23:18.313 --> 23:21.149
Now I'm starting to wonder
if that was the wisest decision.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.109
[tires squeal]

23:22.901 --> 23:24.694
[Agnes] You really love doughnuts,
don't you?

23:25.654 --> 23:28.198
-Is there anything better in this world?
-[chuckles]

23:28.323 --> 23:30.534
Well, I suppose not.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.160
Though I guess I'm kind of biased,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.538
seeing as how I make them all day,
every day.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.456
-[chuckles]
-All day, every day.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.418
-Elaborate.
-Well, um...

23:39.501 --> 23:41.837
I get here before the sun's up.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.089
I measure out the dry ingredients,

23:44.172 --> 23:49.803
I mix in the slurry real slow,
and load 'em all into the extruder.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.013
[chuckles softly] Extruder.

23:52.681 --> 23:53.515
Yep.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.852
That's what makes them
into the doughnut shapes.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.479
The real trick is, um...

23:59.896 --> 24:03.859
I let 'em rise for about half an hour
before I fry 'em up.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.320
That's what makes them so...
light and fluffy.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.242
How come you're so light and fluffy?

24:12.325 --> 24:15.912
[laughs] Well,
I guess you are what you eat.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.000
[chuckles]

24:20.750 --> 24:23.378
Uh, might I try a raspberry jelly?

24:24.754 --> 24:26.339
Oh. Sure.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.226
[whispers] The secret's in the jelly.

24:45.984 --> 24:46.818
Agnes.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.821
Beautiful name.

24:51.072 --> 24:51.990
Well, thanks.

24:53.033 --> 24:53.992
It means "pure."

24:54.284 --> 24:56.119
-[toilet flushes]
-Of course it does.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.079
-[door opens]
-[both chuckle]

25:00.707 --> 25:02.959
[clears throat] So, uh...
is there anything
that you might be able to tell us

25:05.879 --> 25:07.923
about the night that this place
got shot up?

25:09.424 --> 25:11.718
Um... Well, I-- I mean,

25:11.801 --> 25:13.929
I already told the police
everything I know.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.722
Twice, actually. [chuckles]

25:15.805 --> 25:17.766
Do you remember the boy from that night?

25:18.391 --> 25:20.769
I didn't really notice him, to be honest.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.563
Uh, him and his father sat
right over there.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.481
[bell rings]

25:26.900 --> 25:29.152
That most definitely was not his father.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.363
[Hazel] We're just concerned for his...

25:31.738 --> 25:33.615
safety, is all.
It's a dangerous world out there.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.951
Wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to him.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.994
Are you with the police?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.997
We were hired by his family
to help get to the bottom of things.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.667
So if there's anything you could tell us,
we'd really appreciate it.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.961
I'd really... appreciate it.

25:46.711 --> 25:50.465
I'd-- I'd really like to help,
but I wouldn't know anything about that.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.344
Although, come to think of it,
there was one thing.

25:55.512 --> 25:59.391
He had a... um, a tattoo on his wrist.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.561
I mean, who lets a kid get a tattoo?

26:02.644 --> 26:03.812
-Unbelievable.
-[sighs]

26:05.772 --> 26:07.566
You mind drawing that tattoo?

26:08.316 --> 26:10.360
Sure, I... Yeah, I can...

26:15.323 --> 26:17.993
[whispers] It was a circle... and...

26:18.868 --> 26:21.871
Good. And there was... Ah, yeah.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.211
[Vanya] I mean, do you really think
Mom would hurt Dad?

26:28.795 --> 26:30.714
You haven't been home
in a long time, Vanya.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.215
Maybe you don't know Grace anymore.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.051
If he was poisoned, it would have shown
in the coroner's report.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.262
Well, I don't need a report
to tell me what I can see

26:37.345 --> 26:38.513
with my own eyes.

26:39.222 --> 26:42.434
Maybe all that low gravity
in space messed with your vision.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.353
-[button clicks]
-Look closer.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.023
Dad has his monocle. Mom stands up.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.525
-Monocle's gone.
-[chuckles] Oh, yeah!

26:50.650 --> 26:53.695
She wasn't poisoning him.
She was... taking it.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.155
To clean it.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.823
[Luther] Then where is it?

26:57.907 --> 26:59.909
No, I've searched the house,
including her things. She doesn't have it.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.119
She doesn't have it.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.707
That's because I took it from her.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.292
After the funeral.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.837
You've had the monocle this whole time?
What the hell, Diego?

27:10.920 --> 27:12.380
-Give it to me.
-I threw it away.

just like you're doing right now.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.058
-Diego, you son of a bitch.
-[Vanya] Hey. No. Calm down.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.938
Look, I know Dad wasn't exactly
an open book.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.650
But I do remember one thing he said.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.527
Mom was, well, designed to be a caretaker,

27:34.611 --> 27:36.655
but... also as a protector.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.365
What does that mean?

27:38.448 --> 27:41.493
[Vanya] She was programmed to intervene
if someone's life was in jeopardy.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.787
Well, if her hardware is degrading,
then...

27:44.663 --> 27:46.873
-We need to turn her off.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.293
She's not just a vacuum cleaner
you can throw in a closet.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.836
She feels things, I've seen it!

27:51.920 --> 27:54.673
She just stood there, Diego,
and watched our father die.

27:54.964 --> 27:55.840
I'm with Luther.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.801
-Surprise, surprise.
-Shut up.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.890
-I-- I don't--
-Yeah, she shouldn't get a vote.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.309
-[Luther] Wh--
-I was gonna say that I agree with you.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.770
[Diego] Okay. She should get a vote.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.815
What about you, stoner boy?
What do you got?

28:11.981 --> 28:14.693
Oh, so, what? You need my help now?

28:14.776 --> 28:18.113
Oh, "Get out of the van, Klaus!"
"Well, welcome back to the van."

28:18.196 --> 28:19.239
What van?

28:20.156 --> 28:22.033
[scoffs] What's it gonna be, Klaus?

28:22.492 --> 28:24.703
I'm with Diego, because screw you!

28:24.786 --> 28:26.079
And if Ben were here,

28:26.705 --> 28:28.123
he'd agree with me.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.126
No, I don't.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.377
[hisses]
-[Diego] So that's three?
-Wait.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.672
-To two.
-[Allison] Vote's not final yet.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.215
-What?
-Five's not here.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.300
The whole family has to vote.
We owe each other that.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.011
-Right.
-No, we should wait.

28:57.110 --> 28:57.944

29:00.321 --> 29:01.656
How long you been here?

29:04.367 --> 29:06.995
You all seem upset. I'll make cookies.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.125
Do you ever wonder...

29:14.794 --> 29:17.380
All those moments with Mom,
the things she said.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.593
Like, was it her, or was it really Dad?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.429
What are you talking about?

29:24.763 --> 29:25.847
Well, he built her.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.601
And he programmed her to be a mom,
to be our mom.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.730
Sometimes when I look at her,
I just see him.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.108
Maybe that was true at first.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.861
But she evolved.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.405
Well, how do you know?

29:43.198 --> 29:44.908
Because Dad only loved himself.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.029

ever become an effective crime deterrent

30:34.999 --> 30:37.168

after the last mission.

30:48.888 --> 30:49.764

32:38.289 --> 32:42.418
[Grace] Okay, but only for a minute.
I need to finish this cross-stitch.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.131
Everything you did for us
when we were kids...

32:47.507 --> 32:48.383
for me...

32:49.384 --> 32:50.218
why'd you do it?

32:52.595 --> 32:55.515
Because being your mother
is the greatest gift of my life.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.689
Is that you saying that?

33:04.357 --> 33:05.858
I'm not sure what you mean, Diego.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.318
I mean, our father, he...

33:08.069 --> 33:09.112
made you.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.449
When you think something,
is it like he's telling you what to say?

33:13.658 --> 33:15.201
Your father isn't here, silly.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.665
Did I do something wrong?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.500
No, it's... it's not...

33:23.876 --> 33:24.752
Look.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.754
It's okay...

33:28.715 --> 33:29.757
if you hated him.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.552
He was terrible to you,

33:33.803 --> 33:35.555
-to all of us.
-Don't say that.

33:35.638 --> 33:36.723
Why not?

33:36.806 --> 33:40.268
We were just tools in an experiment
to him. Nothing more.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.314
So I'm saying, I would understand if...

33:48.234 --> 33:50.445
you know, if-- if you wanted to hurt him.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.197
Now, now.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.408

Olympic gold medalist.

Do you hear me? Stop trying to defend him!

34:10.423 --> 34:12.550

34:13.718 --> 34:15.970
Look, he treated you worse than anyone.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.391
You worked for him for 30 years.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.436
He didn't even give you
a room to sleep in.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.359
