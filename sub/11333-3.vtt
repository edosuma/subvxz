00:02.961 --> 00:04.379
Previously on 90210...
Apparently someone has a text

00:04.505 --> 00:06.674
of you, like a naked text.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.175
Talk to your friend Naomi.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.844
She's got a copy
of the picture, too.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.178
You and me, we're done.
I made a mistake.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.847
It doesn't mean
that it's over.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.682
Whatever, man, she's been
lying to me all summer.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.392
Now I'm free-- new
year, new Dixon.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.853
Why did you return
to Beverly Hills?

00:18.978 --> 00:20.521
Maybe you were so
busy sleeping around

00:20.646 --> 00:22.857
that you can't remember
who you did

00:22.982 --> 00:23.816
or didn't sleep with.
I'm a journalist.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.693
Journalists don't pull punches.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.319
Yeah, well, they also
don't attack someone

00:27.444 --> 00:29.112
just because that person used
to date their girlfriend.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.739
Please don't send out
that picture.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.281
It's going to ruin my life.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.535
Naomi, what are you doing?
I'm sending out that text.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.619
I know you think
she's evil, but...

00:35.744 --> 00:36.787
I don't think.
I know.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.372
Trust me, this...
Why?

00:38.497 --> 00:39.748
Clearly you're on her side.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.459
Nice rack.
(gasps)

00:42.584 --> 00:44.211
Hey.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.629
(tires screeching)

00:45.754 --> 00:47.631
TEDDY:
I found this homeless guy.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.717
He'd been mowed over
by a hit-and-run driver.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.682
No reason-- you walked up
and clocked a guy for no reason.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.809
That's not good enough.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.144
I guess I was just
having a bad day.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.438
And this is how
you deal with it?

01:03.564 --> 01:07.067
How do you think this reflects
on me, on our family?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.736
(chuckles) You're worried
about what I'm doing

01:08.861 --> 01:10.320
to our family's reputation?

01:10.445 --> 01:11.321
Really?

01:11.446 --> 01:12.322
What about Annie?

01:12.447 --> 01:13.824
Annie is not hitting people.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.538
Okay... fine.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.164
You want to know why I did it?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.750
Yes.

01:22.875 --> 01:27.086
I hit that guy because he took
a topless picture of Annie

01:27.212 --> 01:28.923
and sent it
to everybody in the school.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.594
You should get to lunch.

01:33.719 --> 01:34.678
Can I go to lunch?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.304
Yeah, yeah, go.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.305
Yeah.
Go.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.774
(sighs, groans)

01:47.816 --> 01:50.151
♪ ♪

01:54.406 --> 01:56.116
Hey.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.160
Hey, um, so I found some
of your things at my place.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.580
Oh, cool, thanks.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.873
Yeah, just some
random stuff--

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
a few DVDs--
oh, and, like

02:04.750 --> 02:05.960
three of your socks.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.878
I have no idea how I ended
up with three of your socks,

02:08.002 --> 02:09.378
but well, now
they're back

02:09.503 --> 02:10.965
safe and sound
with their owner.

02:11.090 --> 02:14.551
That's a relief, I'm sure,
for the sock community.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.886
(laughs)

02:16.011 --> 02:17.805
Hell's Hospital.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.056
(laughing):
Do you remember that?

02:19.180 --> 02:21.683
Yeah, at that horror festival
in Pasadena, yeah.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.351
You know,
you can keep it.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.520
I'm probably not gonna
watch it again.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.231
No way, it's yours.
No, honestly, it's cool.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.150
Honestly, I hate
horror movies.

02:30.275 --> 02:34.362
Oh, that's funny, 'cause
we saw plenty of them.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.657
Yeah, 'cause you picked
every movie we went to.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.492
I had to pick every movie.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.576
Otherwise, we'd
end up watching

02:39.701 --> 02:40.911
that sappy sports
crap that you love.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.830
(scoffs)

02:42.955 --> 02:44.665
Well, lucky for you,
that never happened.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.834
I mean, we always just did
what you wanted to do.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.418
Every movie,
every concert,

02:48.543 --> 02:50.378
every meal-- all you.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.922
Oh, is that right?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.924
Yeah, that's right.
What are you saying?

02:54.049 --> 02:56.343
I'm saying I was never
really myself around you.

02:56.468 --> 02:59.721
Well, then it's a good
thing we broke up.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.698
Oh!

03:17.823 --> 03:19.950
Oh, I am so sorry.
Ah, I'm sorry.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.869
Oh, no, I'm an idiot,
I'm an idiot.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.954
Hey, as long as my iced
coffee didn't spill.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.497
I need this stuff to
get through French.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.665
(laughs)

03:26.790 --> 03:28.750
Hey, I know you.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.798
I know you--
I-I know you from somewhere.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.341
It's not
that big a school, so...

03:36.466 --> 03:37.384
No, it's not
from school.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.302
It's from
someplace specific.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.388
Man, it is right on
the tip of my brain.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.891
No, I've got one
of those faces, you know,

03:44.016 --> 03:45.225
so...

03:45.350 --> 03:46.601
Do you ever play
in any tennis tournaments?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.644
(chuckling):
No.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.645
OBNOXIOUS SENIOR:
Annie!

03:48.770 --> 03:50.564
How about another picture?

03:50.689 --> 03:53.316
(guffaws)

03:53.441 --> 03:55.736
Ah, right, that was...

03:55.861 --> 03:57.112
Yeah, I'm that girl.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.989
Mm, I guess
that's how I recognize you.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.408
I guess so.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.912
Well, that awkward silence
was your cue.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.329
You don't have
to walk with me.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.874
I think we're going
to the same place.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.000
You know, this whole...

04:10.125 --> 04:12.836
photo thing...
don't sweat it.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.671
By tomorrow, people will be
on to the next thing.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.464
(chuckles)

04:36.651 --> 04:37.527
What are you staring at?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.696
This is your fault.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.656
Me?

04:41.782 --> 04:42.657
I didn't write that.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.911
Yeah, well,
you might as well have.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.709
He's such a jackass.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.795
Okay, I'm nice enough to
bring all of his stuff back

04:54.920 --> 04:56.630
and he spits on me.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.339
Oh, my God, Dixon spat on you?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.925
Metaphorically.
Easy does it.

05:00.050 --> 05:00.884
You're the one spitting.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.052
I am not.
Yes, you are.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.428
My hamachi negi maki
is soaked.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.429
Such a jackass.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.806
Mmm, still good, though.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.390
How could you do this to me?

05:07.515 --> 05:08.725
Okay, sorry.
(chuckles)

05:08.850 --> 05:10.560
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.604
But then again,
I don't speak skank.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.106
Maybe I could find
an interpreter.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.191
You sent out that
"sext," Naomi.

05:19.111 --> 05:22.030
After I personally came to you
and begged you not to.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.408
I begged you.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.580
Why don't you save
the little scene

05:30.705 --> 05:32.166
for your acting reel, Meryl?

05:32.291 --> 05:35.794
I never saw the photo
before today.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.337
Girls, come on.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.387
Silver...

05:53.687 --> 05:55.396
(typing)

05:56.815 --> 05:57.941
(stops typing)

06:00.527 --> 06:02.445
Got your text.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.199
What, you got a new rule
about who I can

06:05.324 --> 06:06.950
and can't talk to
in the lunchroom?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.785
No, I just need your input.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.538
I'm trying to edit
this piece.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.914
Um, I don't...

06:13.040 --> 06:13.665
Just tell me what you think.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.917
Okay?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.127
(chuckles)
Okay?

06:17.252 --> 06:19.462
Okay.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.471
So... when was the last time

06:28.596 --> 06:30.807
you made such an ass
out of yourself?

06:30.932 --> 06:32.059
Last spring--

06:32.184 --> 06:34.811
maybe in chemistry--
when I asked my teacher

06:34.936 --> 06:37.147
for extra assignments over the
summer to "keep things fresh."

06:37.272 --> 06:38.690
It's true.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.234
That's fairly standard
high school ass-kissing.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.986
This gaffe is much worse,
isn't it?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.112
I guess it is.
No, there's no guessing.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.198
You were a jealous imbecile.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.825
A raging lunatic, a pathetic...

06:48.950 --> 06:51.161
Easy,
you don't have to attack me.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.579
Excuse me, but I'm a journalist

06:52.704 --> 06:53.997
and journalists
don't pull punches.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.040
You must be paranoid.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.583
So tell us, Mr. Shirazi,

06:56.708 --> 06:58.085
'cause the whole world
would like to know--

06:58.210 --> 06:59.586
why-- why you couldn't
control yourself.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.503
Because of her.

07:00.628 --> 07:01.629
Okay?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.797
Because of Adrianna.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.966
Because she's,

07:05.092 --> 07:09.179
like, so far out of my league
that I feel like I'm dreaming.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.766
She's with me?

07:12.891 --> 07:15.936
Seriously?

07:16.061 --> 07:20.148
I defy you to look into those
eyes and not lose your mind.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.444
Go on... I dare you.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.701
Whoa.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.787
Dude.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.626
(whispers):
I see what you mean.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.627
(chuckles)

07:40.752 --> 07:41.962
(laughs)

07:43.922 --> 07:46.507
It's true.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.344
(both laugh gently)

07:50.637 --> 07:52.889
(bell rings)

07:57.352 --> 07:59.354
Need any help?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.149
I come bearing
paper towels.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.819
There are some real
jerks in this place.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.237
I'll say.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.198
Look, I know Naomi
is acting nuts around you,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.700
but it's only because she's
still crazy about Liam.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.035
So get over it.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.787
I don't think she can.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.414
She's one of the
strongest people I know,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.125
and Liam can just send her
off the deep end.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.209
I guess everybody has
their weakness.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.712
Why are you telling me this?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.133
Because I'm sick of
this whole thing.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.010
I want to be your
friend and I want

08:30.135 --> 08:31.178
to be her friend, too.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.347
No, y-you can't have it
both ways.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.058
She didn't send the sext.
Of course she sent it.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.227
She said she'd never seen
that picture before today.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.687
Yeah, because she's lying,
Silver.

08:40.812 --> 08:41.688
Don't you get it?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.690
She wants to screw me over.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.233
I'm innocent here
and she's a bitch,

08:45.359 --> 08:47.027
and I-I'm going to prove it.

08:47.152 --> 08:50.113
I am going to expose her
for who she really is.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.055
So your nut-job brother
just sucker-punched me;

09:15.180 --> 09:17.682
almost broke my jaw.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.559
So I'm gonna take that
as a little sign

09:19.684 --> 09:22.270
that you and I probably
shouldn't be hanging out.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.897
Yeah, well, you're the one
who did this.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.315
You took the picture.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.733
Okay? You have
to help me.

09:26.858 --> 09:27.942
Please?

09:30.237 --> 09:33.281
All right,
but it's going to cost you.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.119
What about her shoving her box
in my face, huh?

09:39.787 --> 09:41.664
Sorry, what?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.791
Silver and her
box of socks.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.085
"Here! Take this! Now!"

09:45.210 --> 09:46.586
That doesn't strike
you as hostile?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.296
Dude, maybe she just wants
to give you your crap back.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.924
(laughs)
No. No, no, no.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.926
All right,
you're missing the point.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.053
Okay, tha-tha-that
stupid movie,

09:55.178 --> 09:56.888
the Ramones CDs,

09:57.013 --> 09:58.890
the goofy calligraphy set that
she wanted us to do together--

09:59.015 --> 10:00.517
all her.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.643
Oh, yo, I'll take
the calligraphy set.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.604
I mean,
if you're throwing it away.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.815
I was so whipped.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.067
So whipped.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.151
But you know what?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.113
The past is the past.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.950
My next woman-- she's gonna be
all about the D-man.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.118
(chuckles)

10:18.243 --> 10:20.287
I'm going to find me
a female Dixon.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.206
Okay, I'm picturing the start
of a very bad Tyler Perry flick.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.791
(laughs)

10:24.916 --> 10:26.376
Hey, guys.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.211
What up, T?

10:28.336 --> 10:29.421
Teddy.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.380
So there's going
to be this party

10:30.505 --> 10:32.382
on my dad's yacht this Saturday.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.301
The weather should be nice, so--

10:34.426 --> 10:36.344
I know, late notice and all,
but, uh...

10:36.470 --> 10:37.637
What do you say?

10:37.762 --> 10:41.224
Well, actually,
Navid and I-- we have plans.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.476
Well, we'll reschedule.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.684
Uh, no-- party sounds
awesome, dude.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.145
Thanks
for the invite, man.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.229
DIXON:
Cool, man.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.897
Navid.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.065
Yeah.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.568
I thought you hated
that guy.
Yeah, not a fan.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.361
I thought he was
a sleazeball.
Huge sleazeball.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.821
I mean, that story about him

10:54.946 --> 10:56.072
nailing those girls at Exeter?
He's a pig.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.993
So we're going to his party
on Saturday because...?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.412
Because Adrianna likes him
and I love Adrianna.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.247
And if I act all jealous
in front of her,

11:04.372 --> 11:05.415
then it's only going to
drive her away.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.208
It's Psych 101, dude.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.378
I need to reassure her
by being super-tight with Teddy.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.256
Ergo: Operation Overcompensate.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.052
Watch and learn.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.180
Yeah, um, okay.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.889
Look, I'm breezing

11:22.015 --> 11:25.185
before your, uh,
geek squad shows up.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.436
Oh, damn, dude,
the Blaze meeting.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.854
I spaced on time.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.147
I didn't even order the pizzas.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.898
I was too busy listening
to you gripe about Silver.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.108
I'm not gonna get the pizzas.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.110
Totally understand, dude.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.945
Guess I'll find someone else
who wants to drive the Lambo.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.454
Hey, uh, let me have
three pizzas.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.331
Uh, two pepperoni
and one with anchovies.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.167
WOMAN:
Safe! Safe!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.918
He missed the tag!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.962
Yes!

11:53.087 --> 11:56.383
Oh, yes!

11:56.508 --> 11:59.010
(chuckles)
Baseball fan, huh?

11:59.135 --> 12:03.473
Oh, I go through some
serious withdrawal in October.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.892
Oh, tell me about it.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.310
After that last
Yankee game of the season

12:07.435 --> 12:08.895
I walk around in a daze.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.606
Yankees?
Mm-hmm.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.483
$200 million
payroll and you still

12:13.608 --> 12:15.068
can't catch Boston?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.445
Oh, please don't
tell me you're

12:17.571 --> 12:19.072
a Red Sox fan.
Oh, hell, no.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.490
I grew up a mile
from Camden Yards.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.950
Baltimore? Oh...

12:23.076 --> 12:24.452
Geez, girl, please,

12:24.578 --> 12:26.496
come out from the cellar
and get some air.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.831
12 straight
losing seasons?

12:28.956 --> 12:31.125
We're young, okay?
And we're building.

12:31.251 --> 12:36.047
We're young, look at, look at,
uh, Jones, 24, Reimold, 25.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.508
I mean, your starting
pitching's still a mess.
Yeah.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.469
But we have talent coming up
within the system, okay?

12:41.595 --> 12:46.182
Oh, wait, wait, who's this
talking about minor league ball?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.976
Oh, yeah, it's the girl
with no post-season contender

12:49.102 --> 12:51.145
in the bigs--
No, no, it's okay, though.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.813
It's okay, you know,
I'm focused on October.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.402
(laughing)

12:57.527 --> 12:59.112
I'm Dixon, by the way.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.948
Hi, Dixon, I'm Sasha.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.118
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.121
Being intimate with someone
is a big deal, Annie.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.290
Did you...

13:10.415 --> 13:12.417
I mean, you didn't, did you?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.378
No, I did not do it with him,
if that's what you're asking.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.213
Okay, but you
did do something.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.548
And I'll tell you
something Annie,

13:18.673 --> 13:20.592
this world isn't
always fair to women.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.885
If you're sexually active with a
guy that you don't care about,

13:23.010 --> 13:24.053
it's not going to
hurt his reputation,

13:24.178 --> 13:25.513
it's going to hurt yours.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.307
(clears throat)

13:27.432 --> 13:29.058
This is real, Annie.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.226
This is your life
we're talking about.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.437
Look, don't take your
bitterness out on me

13:32.562 --> 13:34.397
just 'cause you've had like
no sexual experience.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.523
Annie, that's enough.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.317
HARRY:
You're grounded.
Fine.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.194
Harry...
No, I am sick of this.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.404
This is stopping today.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.574
Why do you always
swoop in and save me

13:44.699 --> 13:45.908
when I'm dealing with the kids?

13:46.033 --> 13:47.243
I don't need to be saved.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.495
No, I'm not gonna let her
talk to you like that.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.079
Harry, you always do this.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.539
You know what you always do?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.207
You always try to be
their friend.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.502
Sometimes they don't need a
friend, they need a parent.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.174
Dude, where did you go
for pizza, Big Sur?

14:01.299 --> 14:03.468
Listen, listen, I'm telling you,
I just met my dream girl, okay?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.261
She's like the female Dixon.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.555
That is never
going to sound sexy.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.140
She go to West Bev?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.100
No, no, no, um, Archer?

14:11.225 --> 14:12.686
Crossroads, maybe.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.562
Uh, I don't know
but look, I gotta go.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.938
I gotta go,
I gotta go, bye, bye.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.152
(ringtone playing)

14:22.403 --> 14:23.613
Ugh, one second.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.240
What?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.369
Okay, all right,
I heard you the third time.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.288
Extra cheese.
Bye.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.207
Nice ringtone.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.625
Thank you, thank you.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.210
(ringtone playing)

14:37.335 --> 14:38.628
Likewise.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.464
(both laughing)

14:41.589 --> 14:42.632
Hey.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.300
Yeah.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.302
Where's the gig?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.638
They, they the same people who
hired me for the HBO party?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.307
And I'm the only DJ?

14:51.432 --> 14:52.642
Okay, yeah, yeah, cool.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.227
I'll be there.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.520
All right, bye.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.979
Wow!

14:57.104 --> 14:58.189
So you DJ?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.274
I do.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.318
That's pretty cool, seriously.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.404
You know, I've always
wanted to try it myself.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.655
So how long
you been at it?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.657
Uh, let's see.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.367
I started spinning in college,

15:09.492 --> 15:12.537
then I had my first paying gig
the summer after I graduated.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.415
And full time since then.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.667
(nervous chuckle)

15:17.792 --> 15:20.378
Wow.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.962
(chuckling)

15:22.088 --> 15:24.716
Wow.
(laughing)

15:26.926 --> 15:30.471
So, when am I going
to see you again?

15:30.597 --> 15:34.559
Uh... how about
this weekend?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.269
I got a gig on Saturday.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.520
But Sunday's open.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.313
Okay, Sunday it is.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.648
Okay, cool.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.316
Let me give you my digits.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.068
All right.
(giggling)

15:44.193 --> 15:46.987
One second, let me just, uh...

15:47.113 --> 15:47.988
Thanks.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.199
(car alarm chirps)

15:50.324 --> 15:52.827
Nice ride.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.374
Um, it gets me
where I need to go.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.711
So, Sunday.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.962
Sunday.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.302
(giggling)
Okay.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.304
Don't forget! Sunday.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.972
(laughing)

16:17.435 --> 16:18.561
Hotter than Beyonce, huh?
Most definitely.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.396
What about Megan Fox?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.565
Whew.
Sasha blows her away.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.400
Golshifteh Farahani?

16:29.614 --> 16:32.199
Oh, come on, dude--
Santori, Divar?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.701
Bab'Aziz, remember?

16:33.827 --> 16:38.164
Dudes, you just need to see
some more Iranian movies.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.416
So, seriously guys,

16:40.541 --> 16:44.211
uh, I need to take her somewhere
that'll really impress her.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.213
The Grove's nice.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.757
No!
All right, dude.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.676
Sasha's a grown woman.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.512
She's gonna want something
a little more sophisticated.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.638
Then what's she doing with you?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.389
Ooh-hoo!

16:55.515 --> 16:57.057
Oh-ho! Wow!

16:57.183 --> 16:58.225
Was that a joke?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.102
Yeah, that was,
I think that was a joke.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.270
You're in high school.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
Yeah? And?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.773
And she doesn't know
you're in high school.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.193
Yeah. Okay.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.528
Okay.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.488
You ever just consider
telling her the truth?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.573
You know, maybe if you
level with her...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.657
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:13.782 --> 17:14.617
Easy there, Nature Boy.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.160
All right?

17:16.285 --> 17:17.787
This isn't one of your
campfire honesty sessions.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.413
This is the real world.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.290
I'm going to be
straight with her,

17:22.415 --> 17:24.251
but when the time's right.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.712
But until then,
can I just bask

17:25.837 --> 17:27.881
in my present glory, please?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.340
Go ahead. Bask away.
I got to go.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.425
(sighs)

17:33.761 --> 17:35.262
All I did was defend her.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.639
Turns out that's a bad thing.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.892
I-I don't know.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.811
Well, I'm sure that that you
and Debbie will figure it out.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.813
Yeah, yeah.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.106
Anyway, I grounded Annie.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.317
Hmm.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.986
"Hmm"?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.697
You think that I can't detect
nonverbal disapproval?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.615
I have two teens
at home.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.992
Was it Annie's fault

17:56.116 --> 17:57.785
that some jerk
snapped her picture?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.537
Well, I think it
was her bad judgment

17:59.662 --> 18:00.955
that put her in that situation,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.582
so shouldn't there
be consequences?

18:02.707 --> 18:04.250
I mean, I know
punishment's a dirty word

18:04.375 --> 18:05.334
these days, but...

18:05.459 --> 18:06.711
Every kid in
the school

18:06.836 --> 18:07.962
has seen that text.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.338
Maybe she's been
punished enough.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.548
(sighs)

18:10.673 --> 18:12.675
I'm... I'm not sure.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.095
I'm not sure
of anything these days.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.766
Don't be so hard on
yourself, Harry.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.352
All I can say is,

18:23.477 --> 18:27.231
I am glad there were no
camera phone things

18:27.356 --> 18:29.358
when I was here...
'cause...

18:29.483 --> 18:30.777
You were pretty crazy, huh?

18:30.902 --> 18:33.112
I, uh... I pretty
much foreshadowed

18:33.237 --> 18:35.406
the whole Girls
Gone Wild craze.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.824
Oh.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
♪ Red light love ♪

18:40.912 --> 18:43.330
♪ Makes my heart stop ♪

18:43.456 --> 18:45.750
♪ Drives me so crazy ♪

18:45.875 --> 18:48.461

18:48.586 --> 18:51.171

18:53.633 --> 18:56.594

18:56.719 --> 18:58.304
Could probably solve
the state budget crisis

18:58.429 --> 18:59.680
with what this
stupid yacht costs.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.015
(laughing):
I know!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.767
And to think I
was actually impressed

19:02.892 --> 19:04.644
by Usher's speedboat
last summer.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.520
Oh, my God.

29:32.730 --> 29:37.526
He's, a, uh, the nicest guy
you could ever work for.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.112
Are you okay?

29:40.237 --> 29:42.948
Do you...

29:50.789 --> 29:54.834
Hoo, whoa, buddy, you are
looking a little green.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.296
This could go real bad
real fast, okay?

29:57.421 --> 29:58.589
Yeah, I know, come on.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.840
The stern is where you
want to be right now.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.475
Club soda, please.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.478
So, are you here with Dixon?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.563
Yes, well, no.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.398
(laughing)
Which one?

30:16.523 --> 30:18.066
I didn't come with him.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.526
But I met him before.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.111
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.071
How long ago?
Just the other night.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.490
Thanks.

30:24.615 --> 30:27.075
He seems like a great guy.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.162
Yeah, he does seem like that.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.956
I'm Sasha.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.541
Silver.

30:34.667 --> 30:39.338
Are you in the music
business like Dixon?

30:39.463 --> 30:42.508
Um, (laughing) no.

30:42.633 --> 30:45.636
No, I'm not.
Oh.

30:45.761 --> 30:49.723
Look, just pick a point
on the horizon

30:49.848 --> 30:51.975
and take deep breaths.
Look, I'm fine.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.602
Besides, I don't think
there's an audience here

30:53.727 --> 30:55.020
to cheer you on
for playing nurse,

30:55.145 --> 30:56.730
so you can get back
to the party.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.818
You don't like me, do you?

31:00.942 --> 31:02.611
This is not a junior
high girl question.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.655
I'm serious.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.947
What are you
talking about, man?

31:06.072 --> 31:09.409
Come on, all the eye rolls,
the sarcasm--

31:09.535 --> 31:11.077
what's your problem?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.162
Okay for real, dude,

31:12.287 --> 31:13.622
you strike me as
kind of a sleaze.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.167
Why, 'cause I like the ladies?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.961
Well, yeah, partly and because
you use terms like "the ladies."

31:20.086 --> 31:21.380
It's your whole
persona, man.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.007
It's like that story
you told in the interview--

31:24.132 --> 31:25.509
about the two
freshman girls at Exeter.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.512
"Oh, uh, I never kiss and tell."

31:28.637 --> 31:31.097
"Oh, that's all so amusing,
my friend."

31:33.600 --> 31:36.353
Okay, off the record?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.104
It wasn't me.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.399
I didn't even know
those girls to say hi to.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.441
Yeah, I don't follow you.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.777
The girls at Exeter.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.529
They were with
my idiot roommate.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.030
But you got kicked out.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.616
He was a scholarship kid.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.410
He really loved the school.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.788
Wait, so you're saying that you
took the fall for your roommate?

31:57.791 --> 32:00.627
I wanted to come home anyway.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.171
But in the Blaze interview,
why didn't you clear your name?

32:03.296 --> 32:06.717
Because he'd still get booted
if anyone found out.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.138
Wow.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.516
Forget about it.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.895
You're a good guy.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.271
I cannot believe
you lived through that.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.607
I know.
My God!

32:21.732 --> 32:24.359
Amazing!
It was hilarious.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.319
(both laughing)

32:26.445 --> 32:28.405
So, you ladies have met?

32:28.530 --> 32:30.282
Yeah, yep.
Yeah.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.076
I was just telling Silver
how cool it was to meet a guy

32:33.201 --> 32:34.703
I had so much in common with.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.289
Yeah, I mean, you
both love baseball,

32:37.414 --> 32:39.583
you're both
in the music business.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.503
Yeah, well, I'm not as
successful as Dixon is.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.464
But, I mean,
a Lamborghini?

32:45.589 --> 32:46.715
Come on, get out of town.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.678
Oh, man, I didn't know
you were driving a Lambo.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.263
(chuckles nervously)

32:55.599 --> 32:57.434
Uh, well, I-I-I...

32:57.559 --> 32:59.269
SILVER:
What did you do, did you

32:59.394 --> 33:01.438
turn in the Maserati?

33:01.563 --> 33:04.691
Better mileage.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.610
I'm gonna let you guys
have some alone time.

33:06.735 --> 33:07.736
Nice to meet you.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.404
Oh. Nice meeting you.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.073
And, um, I'm so glad
that you finally found someone

33:12.198 --> 33:13.992
you can really be yourself with.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.748
Poor Navid.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.708
I can't believe he's seasick.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.209
Relax. He's fine now.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.211
(laughs)

33:25.337 --> 33:28.006
Oh, man, I wish my dad
could have seen you today.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.258
He's still not showing up
to his own parties?

33:30.383 --> 33:31.551
(laughs)

33:31.677 --> 33:33.303
Paramount practically
had to kidnap him

33:33.428 --> 33:35.555
to make sure he showed up
to accept his first Oscar.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.557
Hmm. I believe it.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.225
Yeah.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.436
Still know your way
around the boat, huh?

33:41.561 --> 33:42.729
Uh, I guess so.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.523
Hmm.

33:44.648 --> 33:47.066
God... do you remember
your first time here?

33:47.192 --> 33:50.863
Um... sort of.

33:50.988 --> 33:53.991
You had just finished wrapping
that indie film in New York.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.909
And you'd just lost that
really big tennis tournament,

33:56.034 --> 33:57.369
and you were sort of down,
remember?

33:57.494 --> 33:58.996
Hmm. Mm.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.333
I think the clinical term for
it is suicidal, but, yeah.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.502
Suicidal, yes.

34:05.627 --> 34:09.547
And then you cheered
me up with a promise.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.049
Remember what you said?

34:11.174 --> 34:14.553
I'm going to see you play
at Wimbledon someday?

34:14.678 --> 34:15.762
Uh, yep.
(laughs)

34:15.888 --> 34:18.181
That's it.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.768
I remember.
Yeah.

34:22.895 --> 34:26.023
We were hungry, and we
both ended up down here,

34:26.147 --> 34:31.570
and... and before we knew
what was happening, we...

34:31.695 --> 34:34.072
had our very first...

34:36.366 --> 34:38.243
Um...

34:38.368 --> 34:39.578
Uh...

34:41.038 --> 34:44.248
Uh, yeah, I should, um,
go give this to my boyfriend.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.333
Yeah.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.502
Yeah.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.213
Yeah.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.304
Mmm. Wow.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.723
That was some party.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.266
Yeah, it was okay.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.434
No, and Teddy's awesome.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.643
For real, Ade.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.020
A real stand-up guy.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.521
And I-I think we're
gonna be great friends.

35:06.646 --> 35:07.564
That's so cool.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.691
Yeah.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.696
(laughter)

35:14.821 --> 35:17.240
Of all the pizza joints

35:17.365 --> 35:20.410
in all the towns
in all the world,

35:20.535 --> 35:22.704
you just had to walk into mine.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.289
Oh, my God,
Casablanca...

35:24.414 --> 35:25.498
Is the best...

35:25.624 --> 35:26.416
Oh, movie ever.
Yeah.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.626
(laughs)

35:27.751 --> 35:28.794
But you know what?

35:28.919 --> 35:30.211
What?

35:30.336 --> 35:31.379
I was there first.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.673
Yeah, you walked
into my pizza joint.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.634
Okay, okay, well, uh,

35:35.759 --> 35:38.428
we'll always have pizza.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.346
(laughs)

35:48.688 --> 35:50.356
(sniffs, sighs)

35:50.482 --> 35:52.400
Look, if you want me
to leave, I...

35:52.525 --> 35:53.860
Stay. I don't care.

35:53.986 --> 35:56.446
Okay. Guess you hate me, too.

35:56.571 --> 35:57.656
God knows everybody else does.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.074
I don't hate you.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.868
I mean,
sending that text was nasty.

36:01.994 --> 36:05.580
The way you treat
Annie is... psycho.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.373
And watching me defend you

36:07.499 --> 36:10.460
when you knew that
you were lying really sucks.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.587
Wait. This is your way of saying
you don't hate me?

36:12.712 --> 36:16.382
You're a piece
of work, Nay.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.011
When I saw how Annie
attacked you on the boat...

36:20.804 --> 36:22.180
...it was so cruel.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.309
All of a sudden,
I couldn't really blame you.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.686
Thanks.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.897
Maybe Annie's right.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.733
Everyone I loved did wind up
loving her more.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.570
I don't know
if I'll ever find anyone.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.614
Are you kidding me?

36:39.739 --> 36:41.700
You're Naomi Clark.

36:41.825 --> 36:44.077
You rule West Bev.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.913
Snap your fingers, and you
can have anyone you want.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.790
There's no one more confident,
more popular.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.249
Confident?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.877
No, no, that's you.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.086
You're the one
who doesn't

36:53.211 --> 36:54.838
give a crap
what the crowd thinks.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.255
You're the true original.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.092
Yeah, that's why
I do things like...

37:06.058 --> 37:08.143
I went
to have it removed yesterday.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.687
I found out
it takes seven sessions

37:10.812 --> 37:13.231
and eight months.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.358
It still hurts?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.443
Yeah. More than I realized.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.784
'Cause it takes a long time
to make someone fade away.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.327
(sighs)

37:26.452 --> 37:28.580
Is it true he's here
with some older chick?

37:28.705 --> 37:29.956
Sasha.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.500
Who thinks that

37:32.625 --> 37:35.921
he's a music exec
with a $200,000 car.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.839
And I just...

37:37.964 --> 37:41.593
(crying):
played along.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.220
It's pathetic, huh?

37:43.344 --> 37:45.638
I thought I was over him,
but here I am.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.265
Are you crazy?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.935
Can't you see how much progress
you made today?

37:50.060 --> 37:51.811
You could have totally
busted him back there.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.479
The chick gave you a loaded gun.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.565
I mean, me-- I would have
at least grazed him.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.692
(laughs)

37:57.817 --> 37:59.027
You're amazing.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.695
I could have broken his arms.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.155
See what I mean?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.824
You're practically
Mrs. Gael Garcia Bernal.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.035
Okay, now, that has
a nice ring to it.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.079
See? You'll be over him
in no time.

38:11.497 --> 38:12.791
You're doing great.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.584
So are you, you know.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.678
(typing)

38:27.180 --> 38:28.974
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

38:29.099 --> 38:30.642
Good night.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.518
Night, hon.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.825
(sighs)

38:46.950 --> 38:48.160
You know what
we should do?

38:48.285 --> 38:49.702
We should throw
Teddy a party.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.663
It could be a "welcome
back to SoCal."

38:51.788 --> 38:53.539
We could do it
at my place.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.749
Maybe.

38:54.874 --> 38:55.875
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

38:56.001 --> 38:56.793
DIXON:
Hey, guys.

38:56.918 --> 38:57.961
Um...

38:58.086 --> 38:59.045
(clears throat)
Navid?

38:59.171 --> 39:02.381
Yes?

39:02.507 --> 39:05.510
I kind of sort of
need to borrow the car.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.848
You know, you're kind of
a douche to work for.

39:09.973 --> 39:10.765
I know. I owe you.

39:10.890 --> 39:11.933
Okay.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.060
Thanks, man.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.605
(sighs)

39:20.566 --> 39:21.567
Hey.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.029
Hey.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.656
So...

39:26.781 --> 39:28.116
So...?
Well,

39:28.241 --> 39:30.576
you owe me,

39:30.702 --> 39:31.744
right?

39:31.870 --> 39:32.954
A deal's a deal.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.622
All right.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.833
Uh, give me
just a sec, okay?

39:36.958 --> 39:38.668
Mm.
I'll meet
you outside.

39:49.971 --> 39:50.763
(keys rattling)

39:55.935 --> 39:57.645
(lock clicks)

39:59.022 --> 40:01.649
(panting)

40:07.572 --> 40:09.407
(loud clattering)

40:30.136 --> 40:32.680
Can I see how she feels?

40:32.805 --> 40:37.518
Um... why not?

40:37.643 --> 40:40.438
(Sasha laughing)

40:45.902 --> 40:47.904
(engine starting)

40:52.367 --> 40:54.286
All right, so, look,
with no traffic,

40:54.411 --> 40:56.662
this puppy could get us
to Beverly Hills in about

40:56.788 --> 40:57.914
seven minutes.
Oh, yeah.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.582
Too bad we're not going
to Beverly Hills.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.127
Wait, but that's where I live.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.544
It's still
the weekend.

41:03.669 --> 41:05.504
And wasn't our date
supposed to be tomorrow?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.589
Well, yeah, but...

41:06.714 --> 41:08.925
Yeah, well, it's
starting early then.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.135
(seatbelt clicks)

41:10.260 --> 41:13.054
You might want
to click that.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.848
'Cause we're going to Napa.
