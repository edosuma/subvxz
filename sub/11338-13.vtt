* I have been my own *

00:30.094 --> 00:34.018

00:48.075 --> 00:53.859
* I am asking *

00:53.860 --> 00:59.700

* I'm sorry *

01:55.947 --> 01:57.786
* oh... *

02:33.950 --> 02:36.826
Ok. I'll see what I can do.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.665
Thanks.

03:17.011 --> 03:19.215
I'm not sure what we have here,

03:19.216 --> 03:20.987
But I just got a call
and some case files

03:20.988 --> 03:23.227
From a sheriff samuel in
uinta county, wyoming.

03:23.228 --> 03:26.102
6 nights ago, two different
teens were found hanging

03:26.103 --> 03:27.807
Hanging? In their bedrooms.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.510
Trish leake was dead when she was found.

03:29.511 --> 03:32.952
Ryan krouse was revived on scene,
but then died a few days later

03:32.953 --> 03:35.424
In the hospital.

03:35.425 --> 03:37.428
I know we don't handle suicides.

03:37.429 --> 03:39.833
But the previous Friday, two more boys

03:39.834 --> 03:41.804
A few towns over were found hanging

03:41.805 --> 03:43.741
On the backs of their doors.

03:43.742 --> 03:46.914
4 successful suicides in the
same rural county in a week?

03:46.915 --> 03:48.852
That's, uh, way above
the national average.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.121
I know.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.624
These kids don't fit the pattern.

03:52.625 --> 03:55.228
No drug or alcohol abuse,
no antidepressants,

03:55.229 --> 03:56.730
No prior arrests.

03:56.731 --> 03:58.333
These are just plain good kids

03:58.334 --> 03:59.903
Who decided to hang themselves

03:59.904 --> 04:02.574
At approximately the same
time on a Friday night.

04:06.584 --> 04:09.555
When someone feels trapped

04:09.556 --> 04:12.824
In what feels like a hopeless situation,

04:12.825 --> 04:15.692
Pulling the trigger or swallowing
pills or hanging yourself

04:15.693 --> 04:17.493
Seems like the only way out.

04:17.494 --> 04:20.027
None of that seems to exist here.

04:20.028 --> 04:21.695
Something's really wrong.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.997
Hotch, I can feel it.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.735
Look, all these events
happened on a Friday.

04:30.736 --> 04:32.970
It's Wednesday.

04:32.971 --> 04:35.906
We're not on another case right now.

04:40.377 --> 04:43.078
All right. Generate an
equivocal death investigation

04:43.079 --> 04:44.779
And get everybody on the jet.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.082
We will determine whether these
are homicides or suicides.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.284
And even if they are suicides...

04:50.285 --> 04:52.753
There's definitely something wrong here.

05:50.006 --> 05:52.374
Sir, it's not that I'm not
glad to be coming with you,

05:52.375 --> 05:54.511
Because I am. I just
don't understand the why.

05:54.512 --> 05:55.579
One of the aspects

05:55.580 --> 05:56.948
Of an equivocal death investigation

05:56.949 --> 05:58.482
When suicide is a probability

05:58.483 --> 06:00.484
Is an indirect personality assessment.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.819
Our victims are all
internet generation kids.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.554
There should be invaluable personal data

06:04.555 --> 06:07.289
On their computers to
mine for the evaluation.

06:07.290 --> 06:08.724
If they committed suicide,

06:08.725 --> 06:10.559
Evidence of it will probably
in their cyber world.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.295
So I'm gonna snoop through
dead kids' computers?

06:13.296 --> 06:15.497
This plane seldom makes pleasure trips.

06:15.498 --> 06:17.665
We've all been over the files.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.100
Let's talk about victimology.

06:19.101 --> 06:22.769
Ok. All 4 kids were decent students,

06:22.770 --> 06:23.870
From different neighboring towns

06:23.871 --> 06:26.072
But the same school and the same county.

06:26.073 --> 06:27.740
Active in sports and community.

06:27.741 --> 06:29.541
Intact families, no mental disorders,

06:29.542 --> 06:31.742
No precipitating events.

06:31.743 --> 06:32.810
These are just average good kids.

06:32.811 --> 06:34.144
There has to be some underlying issue.

06:34.145 --> 06:36.279
Besides relative proximity

06:36.280 --> 06:38.548
There's no obvious connection
between any of them.

06:38.549 --> 06:40.583
It seems to rule out
an overt suicide pact.

06:40.584 --> 06:42.784
The first few days leading
up to a teenager's suicide

06:42.785 --> 06:44.919
Are usually very telling.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.254
Their behavior is transparent.

06:46.255 --> 06:48.155
There's a multitude of indicators.

06:48.156 --> 06:50.156
Yeah, but the most
common don't exist here.

06:50.157 --> 06:52.226
There's no prior attempts,

06:52.227 --> 06:54.327
No period of deep depression,

06:54.328 --> 06:55.928
No withdrawal from family members,

06:55.929 --> 06:58.263
No spontaneous proclamations of love.

06:58.264 --> 07:01.665
Spontaneous proclamations of love?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.768
Sometimes a suicidal person,

07:05.769 --> 07:07.936
In the days leading up to the act,

07:07.937 --> 07:10.004
Will just blurt out "I
love you" to family,

07:10.005 --> 07:12.940
Sort of like a goodbye.

07:18.584 --> 07:22.018
We'll start with the latest two victims.

07:22.019 --> 07:24.920
If they were suicides,
let's find out what drove them to it.

07:40.003 --> 07:43.105
Hello. Rhonda samuel.

07:43.106 --> 07:45.173
Hi. Agent jareau. We spoke on the phone.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.307
Thanks for coming out.

07:46.308 --> 07:48.309
My county's getting pretty shook up.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.277
I got this reporter won't stop calling.

07:50.278 --> 07:52.044
I'm holding him off,
but he's connecting the dots

07:52.045 --> 07:54.548
On the number of suicides.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.884
Should I call him back?

07:56.885 --> 07:57.951
No, not just yet.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.052
We need to be very careful

07:59.053 --> 08:00.654
About when we release this information.

08:00.655 --> 08:03.755
Sensationalizing these deaths may
cause a domino effect with other kids.

08:03.756 --> 08:05.156
The term is suicide contagion.

08:05.157 --> 08:06.524
The spread of suicidal thoughts

08:06.525 --> 08:07.725
Among a group of people

08:07.726 --> 08:10.127
That sometimes results in copycat acts.

08:10.128 --> 08:11.863
It's especially prevalent in teen cases,

08:11.864 --> 08:13.264
And studies suggest that media coverage

08:13.265 --> 08:14.665
Is sometimes associated
with more deaths.

08:14.666 --> 08:17.066
Is there a good place for me to set up?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.069
Don't have much of a command center.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.370
Oh, fret not.
I got my own command center.

08:20.371 --> 08:21.438
I just need your juice.

08:21.439 --> 08:23.005
You got it.

08:36.078 --> 08:37.745
Hello, sir.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.648
We're with the fbi
behavioral analysis unit.

08:40.649 --> 08:44.721
She was so excited about
graduating high school next year.

08:44.722 --> 08:47.557
She couldn't wait for her sats.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.558
Was trish dating anybody?

08:49.559 --> 08:50.659
No.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.295
Billy sullivan.

08:53.296 --> 08:55.530
Yes. It that who she's--

08:59.767 --> 09:01.034
What is it, mr. Leake?

09:01.035 --> 09:04.505
She ran up over $100 texting last month.

09:04.506 --> 09:07.674
And, we, um, we grounded her
and we took away her cell.

09:07.675 --> 09:10.443
Not we. Me.

09:10.444 --> 09:11.910
I did that.

09:13.179 --> 09:16.415
Why didn't you tell me
she had a boyfriend?

09:16.416 --> 09:18.084
Because you would have freaked out.

09:18.085 --> 09:19.385
No, I wouldn't.

09:19.386 --> 09:20.452
You are right now.

09:20.453 --> 09:21.753
Not because she had a boyfriend,

09:21.754 --> 09:23.221
Because I may have caused--

09:23.222 --> 09:25.924
Mr. Leake, if your
daughter committed suicide,

09:25.925 --> 09:28.525
It wouldn't have been
because of some punishment.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.560
It's so much more complicated than that.

09:31.561 --> 09:33.294
If?

09:34.129 --> 09:35.966
Excuse me?

09:37.001 --> 09:40.636
You said "if" she committed suicide.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.809
Would you mind showing us trish's room?

09:46.810 --> 09:48.977
Um...

09:48.978 --> 09:50.812
Yeah.

09:50.813 --> 09:52.480
Sure. It's this way.

09:58.319 --> 10:01.755
I knew he didn't kill himself.

10:01.756 --> 10:03.489
He wouldn't do that to us.

10:06.159 --> 10:08.293
I'm sorry?

10:08.294 --> 10:12.163
Uh, that's, uh, that's why you're here.

10:12.164 --> 10:14.798
The FBI wouldn't be investigating

10:14.799 --> 10:16.500
A suicide, right?

10:16.501 --> 10:18.234
That's not exactly true.

10:18.235 --> 10:19.802
Uh, sometimes we do what's called

10:19.803 --> 10:22.405
An equivocal death investigation

10:22.406 --> 10:24.073
To try to figure out
the manner of death.

10:24.074 --> 10:25.574
It may turn out that--

10:25.575 --> 10:28.743
Our investigation will try
and sort it all out for you.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.848
I'm sorry.

10:42.355 --> 10:45.323
She certainly was accomplished.

10:45.324 --> 10:47.992
There's nothing unusual in her diary--

10:47.993 --> 10:49.260
No fury, no angst.

10:49.261 --> 10:52.696
Do you really have to go
through all her personal stuff?

10:52.697 --> 10:55.198
She was such a private girl.

10:57.301 --> 11:01.269
We are terribly sorry
to have to do this.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.405
We care about trish,

11:03.406 --> 11:06.040
And we want to make sure this doesn't
happen to anybody else's daughter.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.975
Mr. And mrs. Leake,

11:07.976 --> 11:10.043
There's a form I need
you both to fill out.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.379
Can you come with me?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.180
If you need anything...

11:14.181 --> 11:16.148
Thank you.

11:19.485 --> 11:21.052
Those poor people.

11:21.053 --> 11:24.322
I just hope we haven't
made it worse for them.

11:24.323 --> 11:25.689
Could we?

11:27.392 --> 11:30.093
Are you sure I can't get
anyone something to drink?

11:30.094 --> 11:31.694
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

11:31.695 --> 11:36.131
Well, if you change your mind...

11:36.132 --> 11:37.932
Do you think someone killed her?

11:37.933 --> 11:39.267
Ma'am...

11:39.268 --> 11:40.267
Sharon...

11:40.268 --> 11:41.669
Why would you say

11:41.670 --> 11:43.737
"if" she committed suicide?

11:45.473 --> 11:47.173
Ma'am, I--

11:47.174 --> 11:48.474
I mean, why would she say that

11:48.475 --> 11:51.810
If she didn't think-- if she thought--

11:53.045 --> 11:55.546
Why would you say that?

12:03.420 --> 12:08.423
Well, personal touches show
she was comfortable here.

12:08.424 --> 12:11.226
Sat prep books, college brochures.

12:11.227 --> 12:13.594
She's a low suicide
risk if I ever saw one.

12:13.595 --> 12:14.795
Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious

12:14.796 --> 12:16.297
Trish had everything to live for.

12:16.298 --> 12:18.465
Maybe Garcia will find
something on the laptop

12:18.466 --> 12:19.799
That we're not seeing here.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.033
Ok.

12:24.505 --> 12:27.640
There's no secret hiding places.

12:27.641 --> 12:30.809
Or drug paraphernalia.

12:30.810 --> 12:33.411
Is this ryan's girlfriend?

12:33.412 --> 12:36.314
Uh, shaunna.

12:36.315 --> 12:39.083
They seemed really good together.

12:39.084 --> 12:41.485
Did he ever date trish leake?

12:41.486 --> 12:43.586
I never heard of trish leake

12:43.587 --> 12:46.522
Until...When we met her parents

12:46.523 --> 12:49.491
At the hospital, uh, Friday.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.993
Seems like he got pretty good grades.

12:51.994 --> 12:56.030
And this letter from the football coach?

12:56.031 --> 12:59.600
Uh, coach barswell wanted him to...

12:59.601 --> 13:02.268
Be in varsity next year.

13:02.269 --> 13:04.802
Quarterback.

13:07.105 --> 13:10.874
Uh, where is ryan's computer?

13:10.875 --> 13:14.277
Um, we have--we have
one in the family room.

13:14.278 --> 13:16.279
He didn't have his own?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.346
Uh...

13:17.347 --> 13:20.616
We were worried about, uh,

13:20.617 --> 13:22.084
Unsupervised online time,

13:22.085 --> 13:24.119
So we wanted him in the
middle of everyone.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.454
I can--I can go show you.

13:26.455 --> 13:27.922
Actually, if you just get us the, uh,

13:27.923 --> 13:30.124
Network ip address,
I believe our technical analyst

13:30.125 --> 13:32.192
Can go over it off site.

13:32.193 --> 13:34.127
If it helps prove that
ryan didn't kill himself,

13:34.128 --> 13:36.362
You can have anything you need.

13:38.398 --> 13:41.433
Hey, you ready to delve into
trish leake's online world?

13:41.434 --> 13:44.635
If by ready you mean extremely
capable and even more reluctant.

13:44.636 --> 13:45.903
Yeah, something like that.

13:45.904 --> 13:47.771
How are the leakes holding out?

13:47.772 --> 13:49.806
Oh, probably as well as can be expected.

13:49.807 --> 13:51.674
Yeah. They're strong people.

13:51.675 --> 13:52.675
Good.

13:52.676 --> 13:53.642
Well, that's weird.

13:53.643 --> 13:55.844
There's nothing here. What?

13:55.845 --> 13:57.312
Nothing useful?

13:57.313 --> 13:58.613
Nothing at all.

13:58.614 --> 14:00.014
Look, there's no root directory,

14:00.015 --> 14:01.249
There's no operating system.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.750
The registry appears to be blank.

14:02.751 --> 14:05.052
But why would she have
an empty computer set up?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.621
I did not say empty,
I said appears to be blank.

14:07.622 --> 14:08.788
Meaning?

14:08.789 --> 14:10.190
I'm gonna need a little while.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.227
Jj.

14:14.228 --> 14:18.298
I know. I know.
I never should have said "if."

14:18.299 --> 14:20.200
Believe me, the last thing I want

14:20.201 --> 14:23.136
Is to make things worse
for these families.

14:24.905 --> 14:29.709
Look, I'm not invested in
these not being suicides.

14:29.710 --> 14:34.146
I just...Want to try and keep this
Friday from being like the last two.

14:34.147 --> 14:35.381
I got it!

14:35.382 --> 14:37.482
It was--it was just a
basic trojan horse.

14:37.483 --> 14:40.819
It just hid the directories,
didn't erase them.

14:40.820 --> 14:41.987
Oh, god.

14:41.988 --> 14:43.388
What is it?

14:43.389 --> 14:45.657
She was on a choking game
site the night she died.

14:45.658 --> 14:47.425
A what?

14:47.426 --> 14:49.761
Uh, it's a game kids play where they
choke themselves to get a buzz, to get
high.

14:49.762 --> 14:52.195
They call it the good kids' high.
You get lightheaded

14:52.196 --> 14:55.562
And a sense of euphoria even though
no actual drugs are involved.

14:55.563 --> 14:56.896
It's something kids in high school play.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.498
Did Ryan have a computer?

14:58.499 --> 14:59.532
Not in his room.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.433
Yeah, he did.
What about a gaming system?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.301
Teenagers will find a way to get online.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.236
I have the, uh, ip address.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.838
Oh. That will help.

15:09.107 --> 15:12.342
Bingo. Ryan was on the same
site on the same night.

15:12.343 --> 15:14.210
It wasn't suicide.

15:16.479 --> 15:20.682
Hang on, this is a text to voice icon.
Let's see what happens.

15:20.683 --> 15:22.083
Computer voice: Come on, try it.

15:22.084 --> 15:24.018
We all do it. I dare you.

15:24.019 --> 15:25.219
I dare you?

15:25.220 --> 15:26.687
Someone was orchestrating this,

15:26.688 --> 15:30.757
Purposely getting the
kids to choke themselves.

15:50.444 --> 15:53.612
Computer voice:
Make sure you close the door.

16:01.288 --> 16:03.923
Tomorrow's the big night.

16:03.924 --> 16:07.193
We're all gonna play the game.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.101
There's a whole subculture
around this game.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.602
They make up names for it,
they do it at parties.

16:14.603 --> 16:17.105
But someone is daring
these kids in this area

16:17.106 --> 16:18.606
To play the game.

16:20.209 --> 16:21.709
It's a contest.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.010
And there are rules.

16:23.011 --> 16:26.013
Come on, evans high,
this is the big one.

16:26.014 --> 16:28.949
Garfield edged out
casper high last week.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.417
You gonna let them diss us?

16:30.418 --> 16:32.052
Diss--sounds like a kid.

16:32.053 --> 16:33.887
Who else would pit schools
against each other?

16:33.888 --> 16:36.055
Reckless teenage competition.

16:36.056 --> 16:38.955
The school that logs the most
high time this Friday wins.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.023
Friday, tomorrow.

16:41.024 --> 16:42.490
Get your friends on board.

16:42.491 --> 16:44.723
Practice makes the high last longer.

16:44.724 --> 16:48.090
Gotta do it alone and
video it with your webcam

16:48.091 --> 16:50.291
And upload it to the
site for it to count.

16:50.292 --> 16:52.058
Doing it alone requires ligatures.

16:52.059 --> 16:54.627
He's basically encouraging them to
play the deadliest form of the game

16:54.628 --> 16:56.094
With no one there to revive them.

16:56.095 --> 16:57.562
Garcia, shut the site down.

16:57.563 --> 16:58.663
Sir, I can totally do that,

16:58.664 --> 17:00.097
But I don't think you want me to.

17:00.098 --> 17:01.465
Why?

17:01.466 --> 17:03.433
Right now this site is our
only way to track the unsub,

17:03.434 --> 17:06.101
And if I cut into it, he will
certainly know we're watching him,

17:06.102 --> 17:07.469
In which case he'll shut it down

17:07.470 --> 17:09.003
And he'll write a simple change
in code, bring it back up

17:09.005 --> 17:10.438
In a more covert fashion.
Plus there's no telling

17:10.439 --> 17:12.107
How many servers it's
replicated on, anyway.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.911
You're right.

17:14.912 --> 17:16.346
We're ready to give the profile.

17:17.347 --> 17:19.048
We believe the unsub
responsible for these deaths

17:19.249 --> 17:20.682
May be a teenager.

17:20.683 --> 17:22.951
He's a loner. He doesn't
participate in team sports

17:22.952 --> 17:26.253
Or group activities.
He's withdrawn, very low self-esteem.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.923
His only form of pure
interaction is online.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.392
He engages in activity that
draws attention to himself

17:31.393 --> 17:33.593
Yet isolates him from his peers.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.996
Parents and teachers should watch
out for the warning signs--

17:36.997 --> 17:39.298
Kids with bloodshot eyes,

17:39.299 --> 17:40.865
Marks on their necks,

17:40.866 --> 17:42.833
Severe headaches, disorientation.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.768
In real life, he considers
himself a loser.

17:44.769 --> 17:47.938
In cyberspace, he can pull strings.
Makes him feel powerful.

17:47.939 --> 17:50.707
Does this kid know that other
kids are dying because of him?

17:50.708 --> 17:52.641
He's choking himself and
daring others to do it,

17:52.642 --> 17:55.610
So we're most likely looking
at reckless homicides here.

17:55.611 --> 17:57.946
It you see anything that's
unusual or suspicious,

17:57.947 --> 17:59.947
Just call the sheriff's department

17:59.948 --> 18:02.349
And we will try to direct
you as best we can.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.851
Thank you.

18:09.957 --> 18:12.725
Well, we've told as many
parents as we could.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.427
Do you think it helped?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.563
Not as much as getting
through to the kids will.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.634
Two different mechanisms,

18:23.635 --> 18:27.037
Strangulation and hyperventilation,

18:27.038 --> 18:31.074
Create the same effec
t- oxygen deprivation in the brain.

18:31.075 --> 18:32.575
Um...

18:32.576 --> 18:34.310
Hey, kid.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.345
Not a  good idea.

18:36.346 --> 18:37.546
Let me see it.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.684
"what planet is this dude from?"

18:43.953 --> 18:46.220
"he doesn't want us to win the contest."

18:46.221 --> 18:47.620
Um...I--uh--uh--

18:47.621 --> 18:50.156
I think the more accurate statement

18:50.157 --> 18:54.660
Would be, "he doesn't want us to
participate in the contest at all."

18:54.661 --> 18:56.161
This was ryan's desk, right?

18:56.162 --> 18:58.264
This is where ryan sat?

18:58.265 --> 18:59.765
You guys remember ryan.

18:59.766 --> 19:01.833
He, uh, played football.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.234
Took--took shaunna to prom.

19:03.235 --> 19:05.402
I'm assuming that some of you

19:05.403 --> 19:07.470
Were probably even friends with ryan.

19:07.471 --> 19:10.739
Ryan wanted to win the contest, too,

19:10.740 --> 19:12.307
But the way ryan choked himself,

19:12.308 --> 19:15.142
He cut off all the oxygen to his brain,

19:15.143 --> 19:17.843
Which sent a distress
signal to his heart,

19:17.844 --> 19:19.545
Slowing it down.

19:19.546 --> 19:22.480
Then his brain, in an
effort to preserve itself,

19:22.481 --> 19:24.647
Shut off all no
n-essential bodily functions.

19:24.648 --> 19:27.383
His arms gave out. His legs gave out.

19:27.384 --> 19:30.185
Which means he couldn't loosen
the tie around his neck,

19:30.186 --> 19:32.220
At which point panic set in,

19:32.221 --> 19:35.056
And in ryan's case,
it escalated to cardiac arrest.

19:35.057 --> 19:36.890
Which means that his heart stopped.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.358
Brain damage began,

19:38.359 --> 19:40.828
And within 4 minutes,

19:40.829 --> 19:45.365
He is completely and totally brain dead.

19:45.366 --> 19:49.301
He died scared and
probably in a lot of pain

19:49.302 --> 19:52.871
And unable to stop what he thought
he had complete control of.

19:52.872 --> 19:55.272
All because he wanted to participate

19:55.273 --> 19:59.776
In what I consider to be a prett
y- -pretty lame game.

20:01.111 --> 20:04.379
So, I mean, your text is
actually completely accurate.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.881
I don't want you to win the contest,

20:05.882 --> 20:08.483
Because I don't want
you to play the game.

20:12.922 --> 20:15.323
You all believe this crap?

20:15.324 --> 20:17.390
You don't?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.926
Why don't you come up here
and tell us what you think.

20:23.329 --> 20:25.062
Whatever.

20:33.637 --> 20:35.304
Hey. Hey!

20:36.539 --> 20:40.342
Hey! Hey, come here!

20:40.343 --> 20:42.244
Come here!

20:44.585 --> 20:46.519
Kid, stop!

20:52.594 --> 20:54.528
Uhh! Uhh!

20:55.563 --> 20:56.663
You all right?

20:56.664 --> 20:58.198
Let me go! Just relax.

20:58.199 --> 20:59.398
Let me go! Then stop fighting.

20:59.399 --> 21:00.866
Stop fighting. Stop it.

21:00.867 --> 21:01.934
Let me go.

21:01.935 --> 21:03.068
It's all right.

21:03.069 --> 21:04.102
You ok?

21:04.103 --> 21:06.404
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:06.405 --> 21:09.006
Why'd you run?

21:10.575 --> 21:12.309
Morgan, look at his neck.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.411
Let me look at your neck.

21:14.412 --> 21:15.578
Don't touch that!

21:15.579 --> 21:17.013
Hey, what'd I say?

21:17.014 --> 21:18.747
Relax.

21:23.285 --> 21:26.320
Different colors mean
different stages of healing.

21:26.321 --> 21:30.490
You've been doing this to yourself
for a long time, haven't you?

21:30.491 --> 21:34.860
There's no telling how much
his brain has suffered.

21:37.264 --> 21:39.098
Dr. Reid.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.232
You think it's him?

21:40.233 --> 21:42.367
He's a pretty likely candidate.

21:42.368 --> 21:43.935
Woman on pa: Dr. Spire to er.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.437
I'm wilson summers.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.872
The school called and
said my son was injured.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.840
Will.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.642
You know him? Professionally.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.710
He works for the fire department.

21:53.711 --> 21:54.711
Sheriff.

21:54.712 --> 21:56.846
This is dr. Reid.

21:56.847 --> 21:58.848
Ahh. Is my son all right, doctor?

21:58.849 --> 22:01.450
Actually, um,
I'm not that type of doctor.

22:01.451 --> 22:03.084
I'm with the fbi.

22:03.085 --> 22:04.519
Fbi?

22:04.520 --> 22:07.721
Your son christopher has
been choking himself.

22:07.722 --> 22:09.690
I don't understand.

22:09.691 --> 22:10.991
You know the kids that
have died recently?

22:10.992 --> 22:12.258
The suicides.

22:12.259 --> 22:14.260
They may not be suicides.

22:14.261 --> 22:16.695
It's a game that kids
his age tend to play

22:16.696 --> 22:18.697
Where they force themselves to pass out

22:18.698 --> 22:21.166
For the, uh, the buzz
that it gives them.

22:21.167 --> 22:25.235
How long has christopher been
dressing in the gothic fashion?

22:25.236 --> 22:27.337
The black nails and the eyes and...

22:27.338 --> 22:29.205
A while.

22:29.206 --> 22:31.240
He's been having a rough time.

22:31.241 --> 22:32.342
Why's that?

22:32.343 --> 22:34.543
His mother died a few years ago,

22:34.544 --> 22:38.246
And he's been wearing black ever since.

22:39.515 --> 22:42.216
Does christopher spend a lot
of time on the computer?

22:42.217 --> 22:45.585
just every waking...

22:46.720 --> 22:48.187
Why?

22:48.188 --> 22:51.290
We think your son may
have created a website

22:51.291 --> 22:55.060
Encouraging kids to compete
in this choking contest.

22:56.195 --> 22:57.795
What are you saying?

22:57.796 --> 22:59.029
Dad.

22:59.030 --> 23:00.097
Hey, buddy.

23:00.098 --> 23:01.932
Take him inside.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.067
Your son needs to go in for some tests.

23:05.068 --> 23:08.537
Will.

23:08.538 --> 23:09.771
When he's done,

23:09.772 --> 23:11.907
We're gonna need to talk
to him down in my office.

23:14.576 --> 23:16.444
there hasn't been

23:16.445 --> 23:17.645
Any activity all night.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.980
It's not Friday yet.

23:27.321 --> 23:31.056
I appreciate you letting us
take a look at his computer.

23:31.057 --> 23:33.391
You're making a mistake, rhonda.

23:33.392 --> 23:36.194
Chris is a good kid.

23:36.195 --> 23:37.895
I really hope that's true.

23:37.896 --> 23:40.697
Here it is.

23:40.698 --> 23:42.332
Well, if this all works out,

23:42.333 --> 23:44.367
I promise I'll give it back
to him as soon as possible.

23:55.871 --> 23:56.705
Christopher, we know you've been

23:56.706 --> 23:58.072
Going through a lot
since your mother died.

23:59.073 --> 24:00.374
When bad things happen to us,

24:00.375 --> 24:01.741
We get frustrated, kid.

24:01.742 --> 24:02.942
Sometimes we act out

24:02.943 --> 24:04.543
And we do things we're not proud of.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.712
He's not very engaged.

24:06.713 --> 24:07.980
Give them some time.

24:07.981 --> 24:09.047
Well, it's almost Friday.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.182
We don't have any time.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.649
Well, as long as he's here,
he can't post

24:11.650 --> 24:12.984
Anything new to his website.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.486
True, but the kids are
still gonna play the game.

24:17.489 --> 24:18.555
Here's the full background you wanted.

24:18.556 --> 24:19.856
Thank you.

24:21.391 --> 24:23.825
No wonder he's a loner.

24:23.826 --> 24:26.126
They've moved 3 times
since his mother died.

24:26.127 --> 24:27.560
Cut off his peer support.

24:27.561 --> 24:29.528
3 new schools in 2 years.

24:29.529 --> 24:32.197
That is a lot of adjustment
for a kid to have to make.

24:32.198 --> 24:33.732
I want you to know
that we're going to be

24:33.733 --> 24:34.766
Confiscating your computer.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.968
Our analyst is going through all of it.

24:36.969 --> 24:38.536
So that we can uncover the truth.

24:38.537 --> 24:40.438
Sure you will.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.875
Truth.

24:46.510 --> 24:48.445
He doesn't seem worried
about us finding anything.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.146
They aren't building any rapport.

24:50.147 --> 24:52.248
They're back.

24:56.553 --> 24:59.022
Mary, this christopher
kid is fantastical.

24:59.023 --> 25:00.355
He's got a segmented hard drive,

25:00.356 --> 25:02.756
Serious firewalls,
major league encryption.

25:02.757 --> 25:05.091
No reason for all that unless
he's hiding something serious.

25:05.092 --> 25:07.293
Ok, so that's why he isn't worried.

25:07.294 --> 25:10.028
This is--uhh! Unusual.

25:10.029 --> 25:12.897
Every attack I launch is
shot down immediately.

25:13.966 --> 25:15.365
What's that?

25:15.366 --> 25:17.132
Somebody just uploaded a
new video to the game site.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.433
It's 12:01.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.968
It's Friday. They're playing.

25:19.969 --> 25:22.503
It's only a matter of time
before some of them go wrong.

25:22.504 --> 25:23.905
Guys, I'm gonna keep dead-ending on this

25:23.906 --> 25:26.440
Until I get a beat on how he
set up his security system.

25:30.911 --> 25:33.379
Hope you got a plan "b."

25:38.918 --> 25:42.787
Garcia, I think that this kid will
relate to you better than anybody else.

25:42.788 --> 25:45.089
I want you to talk to him,
see if you can get him to open up.

25:45.090 --> 25:47.557
Um.

25:47.558 --> 25:49.592
Sir, I have never done that before.

25:49.593 --> 25:51.293
What if I mess up?

25:51.294 --> 25:52.661
You'll be fine.

26:13.846 --> 26:16.347
Hi there. I'm penelope.

26:16.348 --> 26:18.782
Good for you.

26:18.783 --> 26:20.883
Can I sit down?

26:20.884 --> 26:23.686
You're the cop.

26:23.687 --> 26:27.822
Um, I look like a cop to you?

26:27.823 --> 26:29.990
Yeah. What, you aren't?

26:29.991 --> 26:31.391
No.

26:31.392 --> 26:33.059
Fbi tech analyst.

26:33.060 --> 26:36.162
I just have some
administrative cyber crud

26:36.163 --> 26:37.530
To go over with you.

26:37.531 --> 26:38.798
Just a geekette.

26:38.799 --> 26:41.300
Cool.

26:41.301 --> 26:43.368
You are glum.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.838
Time is a great healer.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.774
You have no idea how I feel.

26:51.775 --> 26:55.510
I lost my mom and my dad when
I was about your age, though.

26:55.511 --> 26:59.479
I don't know. I think I
have a pretty good idea.

27:01.348 --> 27:03.949
And I felt totally alone.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.218
Till I found netizens.

27:11.424 --> 27:13.491
Btdt.

27:14.826 --> 27:18.365
Hey, I'm... I'm not lying.

27:18.366 --> 27:20.901
It'll totally get better.

27:20.902 --> 27:23.870
Btw, I like your nails.

27:23.871 --> 27:25.371
Thanks.

27:25.372 --> 27:26.739
You into goth?

27:26.740 --> 27:28.507
You know, I don't think I'm
supposed to be anymore,

27:28.508 --> 27:29.708
But the love is still there.

27:32.210 --> 27:33.711
So you're fbi?

27:33.712 --> 27:36.381
Yeah, I know. It's crazy, but I love it.

27:38.117 --> 27:40.518
I enjoy your earring, too.

27:40.519 --> 27:41.519
Where did you score that?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.620
Ebay.

27:42.621 --> 27:43.654
It's supposed to be johnny d.'s

27:43.655 --> 27:44.889
From that pirate movie.

27:44.890 --> 27:47.024
Most awesome.

27:47.025 --> 27:48.658
She's good.

27:48.659 --> 27:51.494
Established rapport when
morgan and reid couldn't.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.828
We should bring her out all the time.

27:52.829 --> 27:55.831
Ok, your whole pgp
disc encryption system

27:55.832 --> 27:57.432
Is like crazy impressive.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.701
Yeah, I'm into that kind of stuff.

27:59.702 --> 28:02.636
Stuff? Dude, you do not understand.
I am jealous.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.071
That is state-of-the-art technology

28:04.072 --> 28:05.438
The feeb does not have.

28:05.439 --> 28:07.273
Whatever.

28:07.274 --> 28:10.509
Ok. How did you get your
anonymizing service?

28:10.510 --> 28:13.445
I got it from some link
from some dude online.

28:13.446 --> 28:15.213
What do you care?

28:15.214 --> 28:18.449
I just think it's uber cool how
you set your whole system up.

28:18.450 --> 28:20.384
Like how you use an e-shredder

28:20.385 --> 28:22.119
To obliterate your net activity

28:22.120 --> 28:24.821
And a window wiper as your
secondary trash eraser.

28:24.822 --> 28:27.824
Who does that? Everybody does that.

28:29.259 --> 28:31.827
The interview's over.

28:31.828 --> 28:33.095
Interview?

28:33.096 --> 28:35.163
I was just-- his father invoked.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.633
Dad.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.967
I'm getting you a lawyer.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.003
I screwed up and failed
you when your mother died.

28:42.004 --> 28:43.337
Not this time.

28:43.338 --> 28:46.072
Unless you people have
something to charge him with.

28:47.007 --> 28:48.474
We're leaving.

28:52.445 --> 28:54.712
Syl, miss p.

28:54.713 --> 28:57.013
By the way,

28:57.014 --> 29:00.518
I do miss my mom.

29:03.822 --> 29:06.123
She's not your friend.

29:06.124 --> 29:08.058
She was trying to trick you.

29:13.463 --> 29:15.632
Sir, I'm sorry, I tried.

29:15.633 --> 29:16.633
If he invokes, he invokes.

29:16.634 --> 29:18.701
Concentrate on cracking the encryption.

29:18.702 --> 29:21.570
Yeah.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.575
Judging by sheer volume,

29:31.576 --> 29:34.211
Christopher's mother
was sick quite a bit.

29:34.212 --> 29:36.312
His father brought her
into the ER repeatedly.

29:36.313 --> 29:40.049
She's described as being
violently ill each time.

29:40.050 --> 29:42.651
A couple of days in the ICU,
miraculous recovery,

29:42.652 --> 29:44.453
Only to be repeated time and again.

29:44.454 --> 29:46.754
No diagnosis, no discernable cause.

29:46.755 --> 29:48.356
There's another video going up.

29:48.357 --> 29:49.990
That's 4 kids playing in half an hour.

29:49.991 --> 29:51.357
How many kids go to this school?

29:51.358 --> 29:53.526
Its catchment is the whole county.
It's almost 2,000.

29:53.527 --> 29:56.061
Garcia, we really need to gain
administrative access to the website.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.496
I've written down a number of things

29:57.497 --> 29:59.030
Christopher may have
used as the password.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.565
I've already eliminated
birthdays, holidays,

30:00.566 --> 30:01.733
Pet names, and pop culture icons.

30:01.734 --> 30:04.802
No, there was something
pathetic about him,

30:04.803 --> 30:06.470
Not criminal.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.106
When he was leaving,
he said he misses his mom.

30:10.575 --> 30:11.942
What's his mother's name?

30:11.943 --> 30:13.509
Cynthia summers.

30:13.510 --> 30:15.211
That's it.

30:15.212 --> 30:16.946
All right, log in as administrator,
shut down the main source.

30:16.947 --> 30:18.281
Already on it, my friend.

30:19.550 --> 30:22.118
Kids are still posting videos
through independent servers.

30:22.119 --> 30:23.286
Pull up the website history.

30:23.287 --> 30:25.321
See if you can learn anything
from historical posts.

30:28.158 --> 30:30.792
Christopher's er eval shows his bruises

30:30.793 --> 30:34.429
Were caused by manual and
ligature strangulation over time.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.764
Take a look at this. He's also shown

30:36.765 --> 30:39.132
To have layered bruising on his sternum.

30:39.133 --> 30:41.101
It looks like a cpr artifact.

30:41.102 --> 30:44.103
But there's no record of resuscitations.

30:45.572 --> 30:46.572
Wait, all these transmissions

30:46.573 --> 30:47.840
Are transcripts of the
same administrator?

30:47.841 --> 30:48.974
Yeah, there's only one handle.

30:48.975 --> 30:50.976
This is weird. In the
posts his voice changes.

30:50.977 --> 30:52.844
At times he's using more articles,
more precise verbiage,

30:52.845 --> 30:54.110
Like he's trying to throw us off.

30:54.111 --> 30:56.179
That's pretty sophisticated
behavior for a kid.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.581
A writer can disguise
his own writing style

30:58.582 --> 31:00.582
To make himself appear
younger or less educated.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.650
Yeah, but it's virtually impossible

31:01.651 --> 31:02.884
To pull off making yourself appear older

31:02.885 --> 31:04.619
And more educated than you actually are.

31:04.620 --> 31:06.220
There are actually 2
distinct writing style.

31:06.221 --> 31:08.122
2 writers using the same screen name--

31:08.123 --> 31:09.389
One teen and one adult.

31:09.390 --> 31:11.158
Christopher was being
manipulated by an adult.

31:11.159 --> 31:12.559
The mother's death is a textbook case

31:12.560 --> 31:14.561
Of munchausen by proxy.
Surreptitious poisoning.

31:14.562 --> 31:17.864
The kid has been choked and
revived on multiple occasions.

31:17.865 --> 31:19.766
You said the father worked for
the fire department, right?

31:19.767 --> 31:21.233
Yeah, for a couple of months now.

31:21.234 --> 31:24.136
In what capacity? As an emt.

31:24.137 --> 31:26.071
Emt. That's our unsub.

31:29.675 --> 31:30.909
Christopher didn't even understand

31:30.910 --> 31:32.510
The wiping systems on his computer.

31:32.511 --> 31:34.178
So the father poses as a classmate

31:34.179 --> 31:36.013
And invites local kids to join the game.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.681
Bumps up the stakes and encourages them

31:37.682 --> 31:38.915
To use their riskiest methods.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.216
He works on Friday nights.

31:40.217 --> 31:41.584
Which means he gets called
out to do the rescues.

31:41.585 --> 31:43.019
He's not just collecting video tapes.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.587
His munchausen has evolved.

31:44.588 --> 31:46.321
I'll put out an apb for his truck.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.623
He'll find a place to
download the video tapes.

31:47.624 --> 31:48.790
They're his trophies.

31:48.791 --> 31:51.292
After that, he'll clean up his mess.

31:51.293 --> 31:53.895
Christopher's the only
witness against him.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.003
Clear.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.708
Clear!

32:38.645 --> 32:40.046
You need to see this.

32:41.848 --> 32:43.649
There's dozens of discs here.

32:43.650 --> 32:46.320
I was right here.
I never even looked around.

32:46.321 --> 32:48.188
Well, we only had
consent for the laptop,

32:48.189 --> 32:49.489
And he knew it was encrypted.

32:49.490 --> 32:51.825
We didn't have probable
cause for a warrant.

32:51.826 --> 32:54.160
Mr. Summers didn't have a chance
to come back and get his trophies.

32:54.161 --> 32:56.295
He'll definitely try to
download the videos tonight.

32:56.296 --> 32:57.963
This kid was doing everything
he could just to survive.

32:57.964 --> 33:00.899
The extreme abuse conditioned
him to shield his father.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.634
When his father came in the room,
he seemed genuinely relieved.

33:03.635 --> 33:05.002
His burden had been lifted.

33:05.003 --> 33:07.204
He was elated when his
father rescued him.

33:07.205 --> 33:09.873
We need to rethink everything.

33:09.874 --> 33:12.008
Where are we going?

33:16.178 --> 33:18.679
To see your mom.

33:23.216 --> 33:25.250
Now, let's focus on the behavior.
What's the pattern?

33:25.251 --> 33:28.255
Things boil over, the father moves on.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.590
New town, new sadistic m.O.

33:30.591 --> 33:33.093
Christopher knows his father's pattern.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.594
So that we can uncover the truth.

33:35.595 --> 33:39.465
sure you will.

33:39.466 --> 33:40.967
Truth.

33:42.269 --> 33:44.036
In his mind, it will never end.

33:44.037 --> 33:45.937
Unless christopher's decided to end it.

33:49.107 --> 33:51.107
Garcia? Yes, sir?

33:51.108 --> 33:52.542
When you were talking to christopher,

33:52.543 --> 33:55.243
Did he say anything to you to
suggest that he was giving up?

33:55.244 --> 33:56.444
Giving up?

33:56.445 --> 33:57.946
Was he trying to say good-bye?

33:57.947 --> 33:59.214
I don't understand.

33:59.215 --> 34:00.483
Did he give you anything?

34:00.484 --> 34:01.984
Yeah. How did you know that?

34:01.985 --> 34:03.319
What did he give you?

34:03.320 --> 34:04.486
When--when we were talking,

34:04.487 --> 34:06.154
He gave me this pirate's earring.

34:06.155 --> 34:07.489
He's made up his mind. Suicide--

34:07.490 --> 34:09.090
The only victory over
his sadistic father.

34:09.091 --> 34:11.458
He may also see it as
reuniting with his mother.

34:11.460 --> 34:12.659
The father's going to want to download

34:12.659 --> 34:13.993
Those videos from somewhere, Garcia

34:13.994 --> 34:15.527
And we got to stop that process.

34:15.527 --> 34:17.562
I'm already on that. I replaced
the website with a phishing site.

34:17.563 --> 34:20.496
I'm downloading it to the servers now.

34:20.498 --> 34:21.831
When he logs onto that website,

34:21.831 --> 34:23.132
He's going to be rerouted to our server,

34:23.134 --> 34:24.467
And we can capture his information.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.002
Stay on that site, garcia.

34:26.003 --> 34:27.168
Yeah.

34:30.039 --> 34:31.906
Let's go. Come on.

34:35.643 --> 34:37.277
It will buy us some time.
Where are they headed?

34:37.279 --> 34:39.646
Wait. What about the mother?
It's all about the mother.

34:39.647 --> 34:41.681
Garcia, where is cynthia summers buried?

34:41.681 --> 34:42.782
Give me a second.

34:42.783 --> 34:43.949
You know, for christopher,

34:43.951 --> 34:45.150
A cemetery would be a place of refuge,

34:45.152 --> 34:46.485
But for the father...

34:46.485 --> 34:48.054
He's revisiting a body disposal site.

34:48.054 --> 34:50.789
Oaklawn cemetery,
halfway between here and glenrock.

34:50.790 --> 34:52.757
Ok. He would willingly
go there with his father.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.625
Well, the father still needs
to download the videos.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.092
And he might need a power source.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.594
There's a chapel.
They use it for burials.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.929
Let's go. Garcia,
we'll call you from the car.

35:04.668 --> 35:07.870
You know the drill.
This won't take long.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.279
That's his suv.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.481
yeah, garcia?

35:20.482 --> 35:21.648
Sir, mr. Summers just logged on.

35:21.649 --> 35:22.783
He's caught in the phishing site.

35:22.784 --> 35:24.150
Is he downloading the videos?

35:24.151 --> 35:25.918
He's trying to, but all
he's going to get is snow.

35:27.087 --> 35:29.221
Oh, come on.

35:40.131 --> 35:42.499
I don't want to die.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.567
I decide when you die.

35:46.036 --> 35:47.436
Fbi!

36:34.479 --> 36:36.312
You guys good?

36:42.584 --> 36:46.454
Well, I can't tell you how much I
appreciate y'all coming out here.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.623
I'm just glad it ended up ok.

36:49.624 --> 36:54.127
Oh, come on. Smal
l-time county sheriff calls the fbi

36:54.128 --> 36:56.696
About potential suicides,
and you drop what you're doing

36:56.697 --> 36:57.964
And you come here?

36:57.965 --> 36:59.699
We're an asset for all
levels of law enforcement.

36:59.700 --> 37:00.767
It's what we do.

37:00.768 --> 37:04.971
Well, it's incredible.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.739
Thank you.

37:06.740 --> 37:08.374
Would you like to come with us?

37:08.375 --> 37:11.444
We're going to tell the
parents what really happened.

37:11.445 --> 37:14.647
Uh, no. We need to be getting back.

37:14.648 --> 37:16.682
You sure?

37:16.683 --> 37:18.484
I mean, I know it won't bring them back,

37:18.485 --> 37:22.521
But I would think that knowing
that it wasn't intentional

37:22.522 --> 37:24.323
Might bring some level of comfort.

37:24.324 --> 37:26.692
It will, definitely.

37:26.693 --> 37:30.195
You go ahead. Good luck, sheriff.

37:31.197 --> 37:32.865
Well, thank you.

37:45.169 --> 37:46.302
What is that?

37:46.303 --> 37:48.137
It's called a star puzzle.

37:48.138 --> 37:50.906
It's basically impossible to figure out.

37:50.907 --> 37:54.543
You have to put all of the pieces
back together to form a perfect star.

37:54.544 --> 37:58.646
But the origin of it is, um,
kind of a romantic tale.

37:58.647 --> 38:02.482
There was this young prince

38:02.483 --> 38:04.584
Who wanted to win the heart

38:04.585 --> 38:06.720
Of the fairest maiden in the land,

38:06.721 --> 38:10.924
So he climbed to the top of the
tallest tower in the kingdom,

38:10.925 --> 38:13.227
And he caught a falling star for her.

38:13.228 --> 38:15.963
Unfortunately, he was so excited,
he dropped it,

38:15.964 --> 38:18.133
And it smashed into all of these pieces,

38:18.134 --> 38:21.603
So he frantically put
it back together again

38:21.604 --> 38:23.438
To prove his undying love to her,

38:23.439 --> 38:26.141
And he succeeded,
and they lived happily ever after.

38:26.142 --> 38:28.710
That doesn't make any sense.

38:28.711 --> 38:30.545
What do you mean?

38:30.546 --> 38:32.714
You can't catch a falling star.

38:32.715 --> 38:34.149
It would burn up in the atmosphere.

38:34.150 --> 38:38.186
Yeah, but it's not literal, reid.
It's a fable.

38:38.187 --> 38:40.188
But there's no moral.
Fables have morals.

38:40.189 --> 38:42.824
Ok. So it's just a
romantic little story.

38:42.825 --> 38:45.360
And the point is,
it's basically impossible to do

38:45.361 --> 38:47.362
Because you have to
take all of those pieces

38:47.363 --> 38:49.564
And put them together exactly...

38:53.970 --> 38:56.271
There's a lot to hate
about you, dr. Reid.

38:57.707 --> 38:59.441
Play poker with him sometime.

38:59.442 --> 39:01.243
Try playing chess with him.

39:01.244 --> 39:04.246
Or go.

39:07.316 --> 39:08.483
Hey.

39:08.484 --> 39:09.818
Hey. Coffee?

39:09.819 --> 39:11.119
Thanks.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.921
I just wanted to say thank you.

39:12.922 --> 39:16.124
If you hadn't pushed it,
we would never have gone.

39:22.932 --> 39:24.833
Hotch... J.J.,

39:24.834 --> 39:27.168
You don't have to.

39:32.342 --> 39:35.344
My sister gave this to me

39:35.345 --> 39:37.946
When I was 11.

39:37.947 --> 39:41.650
She just came into my
bedroom one afternoon

39:41.651 --> 39:44.353
And told me that no
matter what happened,

39:44.354 --> 39:45.888
She loved me.

39:48.559 --> 39:50.560
This was her favorite necklace,

39:50.561 --> 39:52.261
So I told her I couldn't take it,

39:52.262 --> 39:55.097
But she insisted.

39:56.466 --> 39:59.302
I, of course, was secretly very happy,

39:59.303 --> 40:01.637
'cause I always wanted
one just like hers.

40:06.910 --> 40:10.480
That's the last time-- I never...

40:10.481 --> 40:13.283
I'm sorry.

40:15.353 --> 40:17.554
I think about her every day.

40:23.527 --> 40:26.362
It does get better, hotch.

40:28.631 --> 40:33.334
Losing someone is... Never easy.

40:36.505 --> 40:38.139
But one day,

40:38.140 --> 40:40.509
You'll remember her, and it won't hurt.

40:45.014 --> 40:47.349
You'll be happy.

40:47.350 --> 40:49.818
Thank you.

40:49.819 --> 40:52.054
Thank you for everything.

41:00.662 --> 41:04.198
