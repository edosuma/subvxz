Are you free this weekend?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.563
Let's go watch a movie.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.691
Oh, I have something for you.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.485
What is it?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.612
What's this?

01:13.948 --> 01:15.658
I got it because it was pretty.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.743
It is pretty.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.248
GIRL: Euijeong and Gicheul.
Look here.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.501
No, we're good.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.169
Come on. Let's take one.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.463
One, two, three.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.966
Could you take one more?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.510
So we can each have one.

01:33.593 --> 01:37.055
Wow, Gicheul.
You're not even trying to hide it.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.557
One, two...

01:39.641 --> 01:40.725
Wait. Hold on.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.770
Let me do it for you.

01:56.866 --> 01:57.867
Scoot closer.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.014
I haven't seen Junmo lately.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.351
He's been very busy.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.311
Why? Do you miss him?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.605
Of course, I do.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.066
He's the only son-in-law I have.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.318
-I'll tell him to drop by.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

02:33.820 --> 02:36.531
Tell him to make an appearance on TV shows

02:36.614 --> 02:38.366
like other detectives do.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.744
I want to brag about my son-in-law
like the other ladies here.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.168
Mom, do you remember the kid

02:48.251 --> 02:51.379
named Jung Gicheul from my church choir?

02:52.380 --> 02:54.257
Of course, I do.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.092
I heard he's a gangster now.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.553
You knew that too?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
If you live in the same area
for 20 years,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.057
you hear all kinds of things.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.812
I can't believe he ended up like that.

There are children here.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.920
This is too cruel.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.884

05:03.094 --> 05:05.763
JUNMO: I said we met
because of my father's arrest,

05:05.847 --> 05:07.515
and they didn't ask any further.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.225
But I can't be sure

05:09.309 --> 05:11.019
if they believe me or not.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.190
By the way,

05:19.152 --> 05:23.698
were you and Jung Gicheul really close?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.783
Just for a while in high school.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.577
I've never met him since.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.163
-Why?
-It's nothing.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.248
I'll call you later.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
Don't worry.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.419
Okay.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.011
I'm sorry we didn't tell you
about Detective Park.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.804
It was for security reasons.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.099
Dohyung, I'm really disappointed.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.060
How could you, of all people,

05:52.143 --> 05:54.854
put Junmo into such a dangerous operation?

05:54.937 --> 05:56.731
I just don't understand.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.649
I'm sorry, Euijeong.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.068
I'm really sorry,

06:00.151 --> 06:02.570
but this is something only Junmo can do.

Dohyung.

JUNG GICHEUL

06:11.829 --> 06:14.957
Jung Gicheul found out
Junmo and I know each other,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.210
and he also knows I'm a cop.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.338
Are you really going to
keep Junmo in there?

06:20.421 --> 06:25.259
For the time being, we should wait
for Jung Gicheul's next move.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.762
I'll keep an eye on him,

06:27.845 --> 06:29.555
-so don't worry too much.
-Dohyung.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.683
You know Junmo way better than I do.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.144
Once he starts something, he never quits.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.312
CHANGSIK: Inspector Yu.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.149
You want Detective Park
to close the case quickly

06:40.233 --> 06:41.567
and come back home, right?

06:42.860 --> 06:46.030
Then, to do that,
we'd like your active support.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.490
Sir, please.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.952
I'd very much appreciate it.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.138
Did you really have to make me come
to the office at the crack of the dawn?

07:11.556 --> 07:14.392
Here. Share these with your officers.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.768
They're American donuts.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.687
Take it.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.323
Thanks for the donuts.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.616
Sure. Hope you enjoy.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.872
Good morning, sir.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.956
Hey.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.648
Kwon Seungho's father, Kwon Jangseok,

08:02.732 --> 08:06.027
was convicted four times
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.862
As for the schools he attended,

08:07.945 --> 08:09.280
I'll go to Wonju and check.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.076
Yu Euijeong's father is
the former commissioner of SMPA,

08:14.160 --> 08:16.287
Yu Dukhoon, and he retired last year.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.875

at Yeongdong Severance Hospital.

08:23.377 --> 08:24.712
She's in the Security Division

08:24.795 --> 08:27.924
and her husband is a detective
at Eumseong Police Station.

Here's a photo of him.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.154
Kwon Seungho.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.925
When you met Euijeong,

09:12.301 --> 09:13.886
did she talk about her husband?

No.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.759
Have you seen him before?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.013
No.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.514
Look closely.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.017
Have you seen him?

10:03.352 --> 10:05.563
No, I haven't.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.940
Hey.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.777
Who's more handsome? Me or him?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.114
You, Boss.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.286
Let's go wash up.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.121
Yes, Boss.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.709
Right.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.839
Is Euijeong originally from Wonju?

10:34.884 --> 10:40.306
As far as I know, she moved to Wonju
because of her father's work.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.768
Then, she moved back to Seoul
in middle school.

10:51.067 --> 10:55.988
Didn't you know the police intranet
saves your search history

10:56.072 --> 10:58.199
while you're logged in?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.826
I knew.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.828
Then, how could you be so reckless

11:03.120 --> 11:04.705
and sell info to a private eye?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.040
I'm sorry, sir.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.501
I know your kids aren't married yet.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.463
-Do you want to make the headlines?
-No, sir.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.928
Starting from today,
you're going to do as I say.

11:19.011 --> 11:23.015
If you do everything
I tell you to do, I'll let it slide.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.768
But if you mess up even just a little,

11:25.851 --> 11:27.645
you'll go straight to jail.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.271
Yes, sir.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.399
You can go now.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.150
And always answer when I call.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.787
And he calls himself a chief.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.625
If you hadn't prepared in advance,
we would've been in trouble.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
Right.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.132
Seeing how he duped
the Busan thugs at the rock club

11:56.215 --> 11:59.260
and ran background checks
right after meeting Inspector Yu,

11:59.468 --> 12:03.764
Jung Gicheul seems to be smarter
and more meticulous than I thought.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.685
Let's find out who's smarter.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.520
How?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.442
Let's crank it all the way up.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.569
Yeah, so how?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.953
By the way, where do you go
during the day instead of sleeping?

12:26.370 --> 12:29.457
I just ride the subway
and sleep in the seats.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.584
It helps me fall asleep more.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.711
Hey, don't be like that.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.212
You're making me feel bad.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
It's not like that.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.216
Everyone has their own preferences.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.928
That actually sounds quite cool.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.973
Why did you start working here?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.893
Because I wanted to live a cool life.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.395
The world's going to end in 1999 anyway.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.189
Nostadamus said that.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.398
Was that his name?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.864
I'll live for four fucking cool years

13:01.947 --> 13:05.284
and then, I'll watch the world end.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.453
What's wrong?

13:07.536 --> 13:11.832
Am I being too Gen X?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.753
Why are people in that car
all wearing masks?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
They're suspicious as hell.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.634
-Right?
-What are they doing?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.135
Why masks?

Does it hurt?

16:28.278 --> 16:29.863
No, I'm fine.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.156
It's just a scratch.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.329
What do we do
with that fucker Song Donghyuk?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.415
If we do nothing,
he'll think we're cowards.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.751
Maybe we should go to Busan
and wipe them all out.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.211
I'll take care of it.

I just did what I had to do.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.685
Don't you think
all our boys would notice that?

17:45.981 --> 17:50.110
Also, we can't keep a guy
who hangs out with cops close to you.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.488
Well, where were you or the other members

17:53.822 --> 17:55.491
when all of this was happening?

17:57.826 --> 17:59.286
Tell me.

Just do as I say.

Yes, Boss.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.180
-Yongdae, at ease.
-Yes.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.600
-(GROANS)
-Get him a cell phone.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.352
-Yes, sir.
-Hey.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.436
Yes?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.729
Get him a new suit too.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.231
Yes, sir.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.149
Seriously, he looks like he's homeless.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.567
Get yourself one too.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.111
Yes...

18:32.194 --> 18:33.278
Yes, sir! Thank you!

18:51.964 --> 18:55.384
Hey, Dohyung. Our plan worked.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.430
Yes. From now on,
I'll be his personal bodyguard.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.224
Good.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.308
JUNMO: By the way,

19:03.392 --> 19:05.519
I think it would be better

19:06.645 --> 19:10.065
to not tell other members
that Jung Gicheul had a gun.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.985
All right. Thanks for your hard work.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.361
MAN: Then this big guy suddenly...

19:16.655 --> 19:18.031
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.867
DOHYUNG: You did a great job.
Sit down.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.076
It was a smooth start.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.579
And you stopped next to their car
at the perfect time.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.415
By the way, that guy had some skills.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.833
He acted like he'd hit us,

19:27.916 --> 19:29.668
but then, he'd hit the wall or floor.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.671
He only brushed my thigh. It was amazing.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.590
What kind of work did he do?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.801
He's just a thug. A snitch.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.886
Enjoy your food.

19:38.969 --> 19:39.970
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.390

19:43.932 --> 19:45.184
All right.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.188
Hey, man. Not there. Here.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.524
-You see that room over there?
-Yes.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.902
The top bunk above the sofa
is yours. Okay?

19:54.985 --> 19:56.278
Yes, sir.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.487
Follow me.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.492
We lock the office with a code.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.577
JUNMO: Okay.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
One, two, zero, six.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.541
Yeah, it's my birthday.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.628
What? You have a problem with that?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.255
No, sir. I'll memorize it.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.008
I was just wondering...

20:19.676 --> 20:21.803
What about the other codes here...

20:21.887 --> 20:24.806
God, you have so many fucking questions.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.726
-Hey, look.
-Yes, sir.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.103
This is the only one
you need to know, okay?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.064
Yes, sir.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.684
Hey, it's Seungho. How's everything?

21:09.768 --> 21:12.646
Yes, I'm doing fine.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.774
And I got a cell phone.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.116
Even if they look into
the call history on this phone,

21:24.199 --> 21:26.827
they'll let it slide
for calls with "Euijeong."

21:27.160 --> 21:29.997
So call this number from now on.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.337
GICHEUL: You said
your father used to beat you.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
Yes, Boss.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.589
Was he a meth addict?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.799
Yes, Boss.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.677
It must've been hard for your mother.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.179
She left us when I was seven.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.350
People like us have similar stories.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.729
How was it seeing her
after all that time?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.773
What do you mean by...

21:56.857 --> 21:59.401
Is Euijeong still easy-going and cool?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.695
Yes.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.990
She should've married a rich guy
and lived comfortably.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.076
Why did she marry
a lame countryside detective?

22:12.748 --> 22:13.749
Come with me.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.379
I'm going out for a second.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.048
You can have dinner without me.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.883
Hey.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.427
Where are you going?

22:25.510 --> 22:27.429
It might be still dangerous.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.307
We're not done
with those Busan bastards yet.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.267
Wouldn't it be risky to split up?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.311
I'll see you later.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.188
Boss.

22:38.148 --> 22:42.069
We ordered some food.
Why don't we have a chat over dinner?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.075
-Take care, Boss.
-Take care, Boss.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.907

23:29.533 --> 23:30.575
Let's go say hi.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.246
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I'll stay here, Boss.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.415
You lived next door to them.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.666
You should say hi.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.627
She probably wouldn't remember me anyway.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.338
Also, she's ill.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.841
If I join you,
she'll only be more uncomfortable.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.677
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.236
I'll make sure to frame this painting

24:06.319 --> 24:08.780
and hang it somewhere visible.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.866
By the way,

24:12.993 --> 24:14.578
with Jung Gicheul in Seoul...

24:15.829 --> 24:17.664
What kind of business is he doing?

24:24.379 --> 24:28.300
As far as I know,
he's invested in their bars.

24:32.095 --> 24:36.266
Well, after we get rid of Jung Gicheul,

24:36.349 --> 24:39.102
I'm planning to take over Gangnam myself.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.688
But it shouldn't cause
any harm to my brother.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.231
Jung Gicheul is

24:43.982 --> 24:46.902
treating Boss Kanemoto
like a father figure.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.863
I suggest you reconsider your plan.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.035
We're righteous outlaws.

24:55.118 --> 24:59.498
But that mutt from nowhere Jung Gicheul
has no respect for order and loyalty,

24:59.581 --> 25:01.791
and he's running around chasing money.

25:01.875 --> 25:07.255
Could there be another way?

25:09.508 --> 25:12.802
First of all, I've made up my mind.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.348
Second,

25:17.057 --> 25:18.892
if I make up my mind, I go with it.

25:20.810 --> 25:25.065
Please tell my brother
exactly what I said.

25:26.983 --> 25:27.984
Sure.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.531
Will do.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.325
Once you make up your mind,
you have to act on it

25:36.743 --> 25:38.328
to not have any regrets.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.791
Well...

25:44.918 --> 25:47.379
Sometimes, you let dogs in,
and you let them out.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.047
Exactly.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.349
Goodness, this is cashmere.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.394
You didn't have to buy
such an expensive gift.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.648
Even if you go out for a short walk,
you should always stay warm.

26:06.773 --> 26:07.774
But still...

26:08.441 --> 26:11.653
Wow, that is beautiful.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.532
Not only is your son-in-law
tall and handsome

26:15.615 --> 26:18.618
but he also has a heart of gold.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.707
Is your mother doing well?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.543
Yes, she is.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.340
I'm sure what happened to my mother
caused quite a stir at church.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.925
Of course not.

26:35.635 --> 26:40.140
Your mother was
so dedicated to our church.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.370

27:02.454 --> 27:03.538
Yes?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.750
Couldn't you find other things to do?

27:08.209 --> 27:10.754
So you think I'm a gangster too?

27:12.047 --> 27:15.634
There are always such rumors
about people in the nightlife business.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.760
Rumors?

27:17.218 --> 27:18.345
Yes.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.975
What I do is, well...

27:24.684 --> 27:26.811
It's like an association.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.565
When young people are
in the nightlife industry,

27:30.649 --> 27:32.901
a lot of people come and pick fights

27:32.984 --> 27:34.110
or look down on them.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.197
I thought we should help each other out.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.990
That's why I started my company.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.243
So you don't do any bad things?
