WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.969
I've been going out
a lot.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.073
Patrolling?
Hunting.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.006
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.009
(yells)

00:10.044 --> 00:15.382
BUFFY:
That's what Dracula called it,
and he was right.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.751
He understood my power
better than I do.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.554
He saw darkness in it.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.824
I need to know more...

00:24.858 --> 00:27.161
about
where I come from,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.196
about the other Slayers.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.864
I need you to be
my Watcher again.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.334
Damn it!

00:33.366 --> 00:36.204
You know what?
I'm sick of this crap.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.072
I'm sick of being the guy
who eats insects

00:38.106 --> 00:40.441
and gets
the funny syphilis.

00:40.473 --> 00:43.511
As of this Moment,
it's over.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.113
I'm finished being
everybody's butt-monkey.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.283
What are you
doing here?

00:53.253 --> 00:56.457
Buffy, if you're going out,
why don't you take your sister?

00:58.326 --> 00:59.759
BOTH: Mom!

01:02.130 --> 01:04.230
GILES:
There is nothing but you.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.337
You are the center.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.373
And within you,

01:13.406 --> 01:15.676
there is the core
of your being...

01:17.277 --> 01:18.846
of what you are.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.849
Find it.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.653
Breathe into it.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.159
Focus inward.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.962
Let the world fall away.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.133
Fall away.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.304
Fall away.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.721
(gasps)

02:38.591 --> 02:40.260
Can we go now?

03:38.050 --> 03:41.389
DAWN:
 Nobody knows who I am.
 Not the real me.

03:41.421 --> 03:44.758
It's like nobody cares
 enough to find out.

03:44.792 --> 03:48.194
I mean, does anyone
 ever ask me what I want
 to do with my life,

03:48.228 --> 03:50.397
or what my opinion is
 on stuff,

03:50.430 --> 03:53.199
or what restaurant
 to order in from?

03:53.233 --> 03:57.103
No. Underline,
 exclamation point.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.573
Exclamation point,
 exclamation point.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.411
No one understands.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.915
No one has an older sister
 who's a Slayer.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.586
People wouldn't be
 so crazy about her

04:13.621 --> 04:17.124
if they had to live
 in the same house with her
 every single day.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.059
Everybody cares
 what she thinks

04:19.091 --> 04:22.095
just 'cause she can do
 back flips and stuff.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.964
Like that's such
 a crucial job skill
 in the real world.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.636
Plus, Mom lets her
 get away with everything.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.738
"Your sister's
 saving the world."

04:31.771 --> 04:35.509
I could so save the world
 if somebody handed me
 super powers,

04:35.543 --> 04:39.346
but I'd think of a cool name
 and wear a mask
 to protect my loved ones,

04:39.379 --> 04:41.148
which Buffy doesn't even.

04:43.716 --> 04:47.420
If this town wasn't so lame,
 everyone would completely
 know what she does.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.288
And then I bet they wouldn't
 even be that impressed,

04:49.322 --> 04:51.858
because, like,
 killing things with wood?

04:51.891 --> 04:54.894
Oh. Scary vampires.
 They die from a splinter.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.069
JOYCE:
So, Buffy,
what are your plans today?

05:05.372 --> 05:07.807
Oh, actually,
Giles and I are gonna
go to the magic shop

05:07.841 --> 05:11.345
for supplies for my new
and improved training sessions.
Oh, that's great.

05:11.379 --> 05:15.281
Oh, yeah, I'm actually--
You can take Dawn shopping
for her back-to-school supplies.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.283
(scoffs)
what?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.452
Mom, I-I thought
you were taking me.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.988
Well, honey, I've got
the Gurion showing tonight,

05:22.021 --> 05:25.358
and there's so much to do
to get the gallery ready.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.860
No, but, see, Mom,
that doesn't really
work for me.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.697
We're just going
to the magic shop.
No school supplies there.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, Mom.
I'm not going to Hogwarts.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.567
(chuckles)
Huh?

05:35.735 --> 05:38.406
Geez.
Crack a book sometime.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.072
Look, I'm sure Giles

05:40.106 --> 05:42.375
doesn't mind
dropping you and your sister
off at the mall afterward.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.343
Actually, he does mind.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.713
This is supposed to be
quality Watcher/Slayer time.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.081
I told you.
She completely ruined
my training yesterday.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.983
Did not.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.853
Oh, you know
you did, too.
(scoffs)

05:53.887 --> 05:56.423
Buffy, I realize the importance
of your new Slayer thing...
(knock on door)

05:56.456 --> 05:58.725
but I could really
use your help.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.233
Morning, Ms. Summers.
You look great.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.535
Oh, thank you, Riley.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.704
Suck-up.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.173
RILEY:
What? It's a nice outfit.
Mm-hmm.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.509
Besides,
"I'm here to violate
your firstborn"

06:15.543 --> 06:17.444
never goes over
with parents.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.379
I'm not sure why.
Mmm.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.684
DAWN:
 Riley, my sister's boyfriend,
 is so into her.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.119
They're always kissing...
 and groping.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.721
I bet they've had sex.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.725
Hey, kid.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.093
I'm not a kid.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.231
Well, this is a surprise
of the nicest kind.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.069
Now it's my turn
to be surprised.
I thought we had plans today.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.038
Plans?
We planned plans?

06:46.072 --> 06:49.476
Well, you said, uh,
"Come over tomorrow,
and we'll hang."

06:49.509 --> 06:51.612
And then I said,
"Okay."

06:51.644 --> 06:56.316
Not the invasion of Normandy,
but still a plan.
Right.

06:56.348 --> 06:58.451
We're not hanging today,
are we?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.821
Giles is on his way
to pick me up.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.223
Oh, Slayer training.
Slayer shopping, actually,

07:04.257 --> 07:07.394
but equally as important.
I have no doubt.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.297
Okay, well,
we'll hook up later.
Are you mad at me?

07:10.329 --> 07:13.634
No, not at all.
I'm plotting your death,
but in a happy way.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.134
Good.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.605
Look, Buffy,
I know what
this means to you.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.406
I think it's great
that you've got
this new mission.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.942
I'll see you tonight.
Mmm.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.478
Bye.
See ya, kid.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.514
DAWN:
I'm not a kid!

07:27.548 --> 07:30.651
(classical music over radio)

07:30.684 --> 07:32.685
GILES:
I sympathize with you, Buffy.
I truly do.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.822
But I'm certain
that Riley understands
better than anyone else

07:34.855 --> 07:36.990
the importance
of training.

07:37.024 --> 07:40.593
You can't allow
personal concerns
to distract you from--

07:40.627 --> 07:43.196
Dawn, will you stop
fiddling with the radio
and sit down?

07:45.398 --> 07:48.869
DAWN:
 I don't think Buffy's Watcher
 likes me too much.

07:48.901 --> 07:52.038
I think it's 'cause
 he's just so... old.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.975
I'm not sure
 how old he is,

07:55.007 --> 07:57.877
but I heard him use the word
 "newfangled" one time,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.547
So he's got to be
 pretty far gone.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.019
There's a lot of books
on this list.

08:06.052 --> 08:09.288
Any of them come on tape?
You know, read by George Clooney
or someone cute like that?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.190
You're entering a new realm
here, Buffy,

08:11.223 --> 08:13.393
One for which I myself
am not entirely prepared.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.461
Are you ready
for this commitment?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.831
I'm just kidding.
Hey, this Betty's ready.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.966
Color me committed.
(engine revving)

08:20.000 --> 08:23.370
Blast!
Put it in neutral again, huh?

08:23.403 --> 08:25.906
I'm just not used to this
automatic transmission.

08:25.939 --> 08:30.843
I-I loathe this just
sitting here, not contributing.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.479
No, no, no.
It's not working out.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.380
Giles, are you
breaking up with your car?

08:34.413 --> 08:38.018
Well, it did seduce me,
all red and sporty.
Little two-door tramp.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.355
I don't know.
I-I'm just--

08:42.389 --> 08:45.759
I was so at a loose end
that I-I-I
found myself searching

08:45.793 --> 08:48.394
for some way
of feeling more...

08:48.427 --> 08:49.697
Shallow?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.900
Perhaps, as I am to act
as your Watcher again,

08:53.933 --> 08:55.869
a modicum of respect
might be in order.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.438
Do I hafta?
I'm serious, Buffy.

08:59.471 --> 09:02.942
There's gonna be far less time
for the sort
of flighty, frivolous--

09:02.975 --> 09:05.011
Hey, there's
Willow and Tara.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.379
Ooh. They haven't seen
my new car.

09:11.250 --> 09:15.087
Hey, Giles, sharp wheels.
The rest of the car's
nice, too.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.591
Handles like a dream.
Where are you guys heading?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.226
Magic shop.
I have some charms
on back order.

09:20.259 --> 09:24.463
Willow, hi.
Hey, Dawnie.

09:24.496 --> 09:27.567
How's my favorite
chess partner?
Still leading with your knight?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.202
DAWN:
 Willow's
 the awesomest person.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.706
She's the only one I know
 who likes school
 as much as me.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.106
Even her friends are cool...

09:35.442 --> 09:37.376
Hey, Dawn.
DAWN:
 like Tara.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.211
She and Willow
 are both witches.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.750
They do spells and stuff,
 which is so much cooler
 than slaying.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.452
I told Mom one time I wish
 they'd teach me some of
 the things they do together,

09:46.485 --> 09:49.588
and then she got really quiet
 and made me go upstairs.

09:49.623 --> 09:54.461
Huh. I guess her generation
 isn't cool with witchcraft.

09:56.328 --> 09:58.831
So, Giles and I
worked out a whole
schedule around school.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.302
A block of time every day
to just focus on
my new Slayer training.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.273
That's a work ethic.
Buffy, you're developing
a work ethic.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.841
Oh, no. Do they make
an ointment for that?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.745
People gotta respect
a solid work ethic.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.114
Look at you.
Motivated Buffy,

10:14.147 --> 10:16.515
eager to soak up learning.

10:16.548 --> 10:19.286
You and I are gonna have
so much fun this semester.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.688
Yeah, that reminds me.
With the whole
new training schedule,

10:21.721 --> 10:23.756
I kinda had
to drop a class.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.994
That's understandable.
Your Slayer studies
are way more important.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.328
So I won't be taking
drama with you.

10:29.361 --> 10:32.331
What? You have to.
You promised.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.301
I know, but Giles said
that it just was--

10:34.334 --> 10:37.004
The hell with Giles.
I can hear you, Willow.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.706
Drama is just Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.809
You can blow off training
Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons, can't you?

10:42.842 --> 10:45.312
What happened to
"people gotta respect
a work ethic"?

10:45.345 --> 10:48.981
Other people, not me.
There's a whole
"best friend loophole."

10:49.015 --> 10:52.351
Shop's kinda dark.
Maybe it's closed.
GILES: That's odd.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.106
Well, I think "odd"
just got upped to "bad."

11:15.375 --> 11:17.745
Hello?
Anyone here?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.346
Mr. Bogarty?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.551
The owner.
I-I come in here a lot.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.924
Well, maybe this happened
really late at night
when nobody was--

11:33.525 --> 11:35.928
Wil?

11:35.962 --> 11:41.334
I'm fine.
I just tripped over...
Mr. Bogarty.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.104
What-- what is it?
Is he okay?
It's nothing you need to see.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.874
Dawn, go wait outside.
I don't want
to wait outside!

11:46.907 --> 11:49.076
Dawn!
Ow! That hurts!

11:49.109 --> 11:51.177
You're hurting me.
I'm telling.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.014
I don't have time for this.
Just do like I say and wait.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.115
Here.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.786
(sighs)
(door closes)

12:12.966 --> 12:15.235
Whatcha doing?
What are you doing here?

12:15.268 --> 12:18.705
Can't loiter.
There's no loitering.
(stammering)

12:18.738 --> 12:21.041
That's why I'm a cat.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.143
Quiet.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.778
See, cat's in the cupboard,
but they find you there,
anyway.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.581
And it hurts.

12:28.615 --> 12:34.053
Please make it stop.
Shut up! Shut up!
They'll hear you!

12:34.086 --> 12:36.188
Buff--
(muffled scream)
Shh!

12:37.790 --> 12:39.259
I know you.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.427
Curds and whey.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.596
I know what you are.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.101
You don't belong here.

12:58.644 --> 12:59.778
Dawn?

13:03.149 --> 13:04.350
Dawn?

13:11.390 --> 13:13.360
Dawn, are you okay?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.196
Is...

13:18.230 --> 13:20.133
Is that guy
dead in there?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
Yeah.

13:32.479 --> 13:36.383
They're gonna be
a little while longer
doing the detective thing.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.485
Best non-Scoobies
like you and me
stay out of their way.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.200
Do you want
to thumb wrestle?

13:53.232 --> 13:54.533
Okay.

14:00.706 --> 14:04.410
BUFFY: Judging by
the bite-fest, I'd say
it was more than one vampire.

14:04.443 --> 14:06.812
I'd make it four
at least.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.149
Looks like someone's
put together a new fang club.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.884
Well, I've cross-checked
the inventory list,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.351
and things
are definitely missing.

14:12.384 --> 14:16.255
Mostly books,
including A Treatise
 On The Mythology

14:16.288 --> 14:18.524
And Methodology
 Of The Vampire Slayer.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.193
Oh, shoot.
Was that the only copy?

14:21.227 --> 14:23.763
Come on, Buffy.
This could be very serious.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.099
Whoever's leading
this pack of vampires

14:26.133 --> 14:28.534
appears to be interested
in learning more about you.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.303
Perhaps searching for
weaknesses or--

14:32.538 --> 14:35.008
Good Lord.
What?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.943
Well, I had no idea
the profit margins

14:36.976 --> 14:39.145
on a shop like this
were so high.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.682
Look at this.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.352
Low overhead,
out-of-state orders,
international wh--

14:46.385 --> 14:49.721
It's no wonder
there was never any trouble
attracting new owners.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.225
Place like this
is a virtual--
Deathtrap?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.594
What? Well, yes,
there is that,

14:54.626 --> 14:56.996
but, uh, still...

14:58.230 --> 15:00.799
Location, you know,
pedestrian traffic.

15:00.832 --> 15:03.102
So what's
the next step?

15:03.135 --> 15:07.139
Buffy, you should begin
looking for their lair
straightaway.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.375
I'll get Riley
to help me patrol.
Wait.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.312
Aren't you
forgetting something?
Impressive square footage.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.645
You're on Dawn duty.

15:15.014 --> 15:19.485
Oh, doody.
Gotta drop
my sister back at home.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.620
My mother's
gonna kill me.

15:21.653 --> 15:24.024
I bet the death rate
keeps the rent down.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.761
Oh, hello.
Something's been taken
from this case. Look here.

15:29.796 --> 15:33.566
What'd they take?
I should think
an item of-of value

15:33.600 --> 15:35.434
or-or power,
possibly even--

15:35.467 --> 15:37.236
A unicorn.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.407
Ten-inch ceramic unicorn
imported from Thailand.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.811
BUFFY:
Was it valuable?
List price: 12.95.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.179
Which begs the question,
what kind of
an unholy creature

15:47.213 --> 15:50.283
fancies cheap,
tasteless statuary?

15:50.317 --> 15:54.453
Okay, hi.
First of all,
I want to thank everybody

15:54.486 --> 15:58.325
for a really successful raid
on the magic shop last night.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.995
Good job, minions.
Yes, you deserve it.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.630
Secondly,

16:04.663 --> 16:06.832
somebody remembered
to pick me up

16:06.865 --> 16:09.168
the sweetest
little unicorn.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.772
(whispering)
what?

16:12.804 --> 16:15.341
Brad. Guess someone
was feeling guilty

16:15.375 --> 16:17.677
for standing me up
in the tenth grade.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.312
I-I had to
get her something.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.149
She sired me.
Sire-whipped.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.184
Anyway, the books
you guys brought me
to help with the plan?

16:25.217 --> 16:27.787
Well, I've been skimming
through the book jackets
all morning,

16:27.820 --> 16:32.359
and let me tell you,
there's some pretty useful
stuff in there, so--

16:32.392 --> 16:35.495
Yes, uh...
sorry. Forgot your name.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.863
Cyrus.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.532
Cyrus, right.
Peaches's friend.

16:39.566 --> 16:43.135
What's your question?
Uh, when are we
gonna do it?

16:43.169 --> 16:46.173
Ew. That's rude.
I barely know you.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.908
(scoffs)
And you're a minion.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.412
He means the plan.
When are we
gonna do the plan?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.681
Oh!

16:54.713 --> 16:57.015
The plan. Uh, well,
first let me tell you,

16:57.049 --> 16:59.186
I'm really psyched about it,
and I hope the rest of you--

16:59.219 --> 17:01.453
When?
Tonight!

17:04.391 --> 17:06.558
We kill the Slayer...

17:06.593 --> 17:08.428
tonight.
Yeah.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.104
JOYCE: So not only
didn't you take your sister
shopping for school supplies,

17:17.136 --> 17:19.105
you brought her
to a murder scene.

17:19.137 --> 17:23.040
No, I didn't
bring her to it.
It just sort of came upon us.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.678
It's not like
she saw the body
or anything.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.748
Oh, well, that makes it
all right then,
doesn't it?

17:28.780 --> 17:31.451
No, that is
not what I meant.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.221
I asked one favor
of you, Buffy,
to look after your sister.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.691
And now you want
to unload her,
so you and Riley can go out.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.759
To patrol.
I'm working.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.096
It's not like I want
to go to the Sock Hop.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.266
I have to be at
the pre-show reception
in half an hour.

17:46.298 --> 17:49.301
Who's gonna watch Dawn?
DAWN: I don't need
anyone to watch me!

17:49.336 --> 17:51.738
BOTH: Yes, you do.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.473
Wait. So what you're saying
is if I can get an
acceptable baby-sitter here

17:54.507 --> 17:56.476
before you leave,
I can go patrol?

17:56.509 --> 17:58.545
DAWN:
Baby-sitter? I'm 14!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.712
I'm old enough to be
a baby-sitter.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.316
And who are you gonna get
on such short notice?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.984
DAWN: I can take care
of myself!

18:06.018 --> 18:09.821
Xander.
Xander?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.590
(footsteps approaching rapidly)

18:12.791 --> 18:15.595
Okay.
(doorbell rings)

18:18.830 --> 18:21.000
Dawn patrol.
Hey.

18:21.032 --> 18:25.337
Check this out.
They put cheese on round bread.
It's gonna be big.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.307
DAWN:
 Xander is so much cuter
 than anyone.

18:28.340 --> 18:32.578
And smarter, too.
 He totally skipped college and
 got a job working construction,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.515
which is so kind of deep,
 you know?

18:35.548 --> 18:38.184
He builds things,
 and he's brave, too.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.488
Just last week,
 he went undercover to
 stop that Dracula guy.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.292
Have fun.
Not too much fun, though.
Dawn?

18:46.326 --> 18:49.028
Dawn, be good.
XANDER:
Oh, we will.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.698
We're just gonna
play with matches,
run with scissors,

18:51.730 --> 18:53.500
take candy
from some guy.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.768
I don't know his name.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.171
DAWN:
 Xander treats everyone
 like an equal.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.173
He doesn't
 look down on people.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.277
Hello there,
little girl.
 Even when he should.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.512
We are gonna have
fun, fun, fun.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.482
Look, I've got Monopoly,
Clue, and, ooh,
the Game of Life.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.484
That sounds good.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.653
TARA:
Poor Dawn.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.056
She was pretty shaken up.

19:17.088 --> 19:20.125
Well, sure.
Bloody death and stuff.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.061
She'll be okay.
It's just--

19:23.095 --> 19:26.633
I think it's tough for her,
not being able to--

19:26.665 --> 19:29.101
allowed to,
you know, help.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.572
Help?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.375
Out. You. You guys.
The Slayer circle.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.810
Well, Buffy doesn't
really need--

19:38.845 --> 19:41.012
and I think
Dawn's a little young.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.882
I know.
You're right.

19:42.914 --> 19:46.219
It's just hard,
that outsider feeling.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.291
Tara,
you're not an outsider.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.028
Well, yeah.
I kinda am.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.131
No. No, you're not.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.036
Willow, it's okay.
Where does this go?

20:04.069 --> 20:06.439
Is somebody making you
feel uncomfortable?

20:06.472 --> 20:08.275
Is it Xander?
It's Xander, isn't it?

20:08.307 --> 20:10.876
Xander's a sweetie.
It's Giles!

20:10.910 --> 20:12.912
It's 'cause he's British

20:12.944 --> 20:14.780
and doesn't
understand about stuff.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.285
It's no one.
You guys all just have
this really tight bond.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.387
It's-- it's hard
to break into that,
and I'm not even sure I want to.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.792
I'm sure.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.296
You're completely
one of the gang now.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.463
Everyone accepts that.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.599
You're one
of the good guys.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.572
Maybe I can talk
to the rest of the group,
and we can do something.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.074
Some kind
of Scooby initiation.

20:42.107 --> 20:45.144
Oh! Maybe we can
wear some kind
of special ring

20:45.176 --> 20:48.914
that identifies us
as members.
I don't think so.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.785
But maybe
something like that
would be nice for Dawn.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.855
I do worry about her
sometimes.
You don't have to.

20:55.954 --> 20:59.659
She's got big sister Buffy
happily looking out for her.

20:59.692 --> 21:03.261
So then my Mom goes off on me
about how I'm supposed
to watch out for Dawn

21:03.296 --> 21:06.231
and make sure that
she's shielded from stuff
that might upset her.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.301
Like dead shopkeepers.
She didn't see him.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.939
A foot, maybe.
A dead foot,
which is bad, okay.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.642
But, hello?
I see dead stuff
all the time,

21:15.674 --> 21:18.678
and you don't see Mom
shielding me.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.980
So you want your mother
to give you space
to be a Slayer

21:21.012 --> 21:23.516
and shield you from it
at the same time.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.117
Thank you, logic boy.
Did I mention
this is a rant?

21:26.152 --> 21:29.020
Sense really has
no place in it.
I'm getting that.

21:30.221 --> 21:32.659
What's the deal, Buffy?
You seem really--

21:34.394 --> 21:36.828
Oh. Trash can.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.298
From a distance
it looked kinda--
tense.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.536
No. I was gonna say

21:43.569 --> 21:45.505
brown, squat, shadowy.

21:45.538 --> 21:49.008
Uh-uh. Back to what I was
saying before we were
rudely attacked by nothing.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.576
You seem really tense.

21:52.177 --> 21:55.314
Yeah. There's a new
vampire gang in town.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.086
I mean domestically tense.
You're on Dawn's case a lot.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.690
I guess. It's just--

22:05.023 --> 22:07.226
(sighs)
I don't know.

22:07.259 --> 22:12.064
I know it's always
been this way.
She's the baby.

22:12.097 --> 22:15.667
But for some reason lately,
it's just really
getting to me.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.869
I mean,
she's always around.

22:17.903 --> 22:20.338
Well, yeah.
You're like her idol,
Buffy.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.575
Her idol?
I don't think so,

22:22.608 --> 22:26.345
unless you like to spill
things on your idol's
new leather pants and--

22:26.378 --> 22:27.913
You know what I mean.

22:27.946 --> 22:31.417
You have super powers
and college,

22:31.451 --> 22:33.219
a studly
yet sensitive boyfriend.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.320
And a pesky
life-or-death job

22:35.354 --> 22:37.990
that I can't quit
or even take a break from.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.326
She doesn't get
the sacrifices.
She's a kid.

22:41.359 --> 22:45.397
And that's what bugs!
She gets to be a kid,

22:45.432 --> 22:49.201
and she acts
like it's the biggest
burden in the world.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.738
Sometimes I would like
to just curl up
in Mom's lap

22:51.770 --> 22:54.039
and not worry about
the fate of the world.

22:54.073 --> 22:58.376
I'd like to be the one
who's protected,
who's waited on...

22:58.411 --> 23:00.211
Hand and foot,
getting her own way,

23:00.246 --> 23:02.714
always the favorite.
You nut.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.551
Your Mom loves you
both equally,
but if I'm wrong,

23:05.585 --> 23:08.721
I find money usually
helps tip the scale.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.923
Slip Joyce a ten or a 20
once in a while. Then
we'll see who's the favorite.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.861
DAWN:
 He says I'm like a kid sister.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.464
Here come the judge.
 But sometimes
 when he looks at me,

23:18.498 --> 23:20.231
I feel like he sees me
 as I am...

23:21.733 --> 23:23.102
as a woman.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.573
Crap. Look at this.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.875
Now I'm burdened with
a husband and several
tiny pink children

23:29.909 --> 23:31.911
and more cash than
I can reasonably manage.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.013
That means
you're winning.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.083
Really?

23:37.115 --> 23:38.585
Yes.
Cash equals good.

23:38.617 --> 23:42.253
Ooh!
I'm so pleased.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.289
Can I trade in
the children for more cash?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.326
(glass shatters)
(Dawn screams)

23:57.769 --> 23:59.672
"Slayer, come out and die."

24:01.807 --> 24:03.776
HARMONY:
I'm waiting for you, Buffy!

24:12.852 --> 24:14.787
I know you're in there!

24:17.355 --> 24:19.290
HARMONY:
What do you mean,
she's not in there?

24:19.325 --> 24:23.429
She has to be.
I'm calling her out.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.298
Then I bet
she'll be real sorry
she missed your call.

24:26.332 --> 24:29.367
Afraid you and your buddies
are gonna have to come back
and be killed by Buffy later.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.538
They're not my buddies.
They're my minions.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.507
They're what now?

24:34.540 --> 24:38.044
Minions!
You know, lackeys?

24:38.076 --> 24:40.378
They work for me.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.486
What's so funny?
Nothing.

24:47.519 --> 24:51.891
What could be funny? Just,
"Look out! It's the terrifying
Harmony gang! Ooh!"

24:51.923 --> 24:53.491
Stop laughing!

24:56.596 --> 24:58.530
I just-- I-I just can't
picture anyone

24:58.565 --> 25:00.266
pathetic enough
to be following--

25:01.567 --> 25:04.636
Is that Brad Konnick?
Ha!

25:04.671 --> 25:06.972
Hey, Brad, who'd have thought
when you were beating
up kids in gym class,

25:07.006 --> 25:08.875
you'd end up
Harmony's lapdog?

25:08.907 --> 25:11.644
Screw you, Harris.
(Harmony chuckles)

25:11.678 --> 25:14.913
You should know all about
being somebody's lapdog.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.348
I hear you were
a good little puppy
for Dracula.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.719
You heard wrong.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.721
Don't feel bad.
I hear that
mind control thing he does

25:22.755 --> 25:26.392
works really well on weak,
'fraidy-cat losers.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.326
You didn't stand a chance.

25:28.359 --> 25:31.763
Shut up!
Dawn, I'm handling this.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.701
Shut up, Harmony!
Make me.

25:35.734 --> 25:39.005
Afraid I don't feel
like getting into another
hair-pulling contest with you.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.874
You're the hair-puller,
you big girl.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.076
Oh, yeah?
Come inside
and say that.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.744
Xander will kick your--
Dawn, no!

25:48.447 --> 25:50.950
(growls)
(Dawn screams)

25:57.723 --> 25:59.290
(screams)

26:04.296 --> 26:07.432
The invitation was for one.
(all growling)

26:09.000 --> 26:11.103
Not such a pushover
anymore, am I?

26:13.138 --> 26:15.307
Think a Slayer's house
would have more weapons
lying around.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.743
I've been working out,
learning some new tricks,

26:17.777 --> 26:19.310
Honing my...

26:20.479 --> 26:21.814
instincts.

26:26.952 --> 26:30.056
HARMONY:
This isn't over, Xander!
I'll be back!

26:30.088 --> 26:33.259
And we'll be
ready for you.
Stakes, crosses,

26:33.291 --> 26:34.593
the whole enchilada.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.097
Buffy is not gonna
be happy about this.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.804
Harmony...

26:46.105 --> 26:47.940
Harmony has minions?

26:47.973 --> 26:50.509
Yeah, that was
pretty much my reaction.

26:50.541 --> 26:53.011
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(clears throat)

26:53.045 --> 26:57.348
It's just...
Harmony has minions.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.786
And Ruffles have ridges.

26:59.818 --> 27:04.022
Uh, Buffy, there's actually
a more serious side
to all this.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.526
I sure hope so,
'cause I'm having
trouble breathing.

27:07.558 --> 27:09.161
(clears throat)
What is it?

27:10.229 --> 27:12.530
Well, she did
come here to kill you.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.336
Buffy, come on.
They have killed once
that we know of.

27:17.368 --> 27:19.038
She could be
a threat to you.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.240
Especially now that
she can enter your house
anytime she wants.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.644
What?

27:28.513 --> 27:31.616
Uh, yeah.
Actually, she--

27:31.650 --> 27:34.486
Harmony kind of happened
to sort of get an invite.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.357
You guys can't
invite her in.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.326
I mean, only someone
who lives here can--

27:45.564 --> 27:47.032
Where is she?

27:47.066 --> 27:50.501
In her room.
Look, I think she's still
pretty freaked out.

27:50.536 --> 27:54.039
Dawn!
Buff, it was an accident.
She didn't mean it.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.575
Oh, well, that just
makes it okay then,
doesn't it?

27:56.607 --> 27:59.545
No, but believe me.
Nobody feels worse
than her right now.

27:59.577 --> 28:02.314
What a total disaster.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.550
My first plan.
I so wanted it
to go well.

28:05.584 --> 28:08.386
Plus, I didn't
even get to kill
stupid Xander Harris.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.757
God, that was
so embarrassing.
We'll go back later.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.991
No. It's no good.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.527
Buffy's gonna
expect us now.
The whole surprise is blown.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.695
(growling)
Who are you
growling at?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.365
Not me. My stomach.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.733
If I don't
eat somebody soon,
I'll get dizzy.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.670
Let's go back to the lair.
That census taker
may not be empty yet.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.874
Not me. This night is young,
and I want some action.

28:31.076 --> 28:33.211
Happy to oblige.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.580
Here I thought it was
gonna be a slow night.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.750
Step on up, kiddies.
Thrashings for all.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.318
Stop!

28:43.454 --> 28:46.192
Well, hello, Harm.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.492
Spikey.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.762
I mean, Spike.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.632
Long time.
You look good.

28:53.664 --> 28:55.768
I feel good.

28:55.801 --> 28:58.069
I remember.

28:59.637 --> 29:00.940
How have you been?

29:00.972 --> 29:02.441
Not bad.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.544
Just got a brand-new
telly in my crib, so--

29:05.576 --> 29:08.047
Why are you
talking to him?

29:08.079 --> 29:12.050
It's okay.
We used to go steady.
(sighs)

29:12.084 --> 29:14.854
Spike, Mort.
Mort, this is--
I know who he is.

29:14.953 --> 29:17.588
He kills our kind.
Oh, yeah.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.125
What's up
with that?

29:20.159 --> 29:22.260
Bloke's gotta have
a hobby, don't he?
Piss off, Mort.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.762
(growling)
Mort.
Just give us...

29:26.031 --> 29:29.801
a couple minutes, okay?

29:29.836 --> 29:34.339
He's really testy.
Some of us are thinking
of voting him out of the gang.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.977
Gang?
Oh, yeah.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.478
I've got
my own gang now.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.249
Is that what those
circus freaks are?
Uh-huh.

29:43.281 --> 29:47.419
I mean...
shut up.

29:47.452 --> 29:51.589
We're gonna kill the Slayer.
Singing my song now,
are you?

29:51.623 --> 29:54.692
You should pay me
royalties for that one,
or at least get your own tune.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.663
I'm not gonna make
the same mistakes
you did.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.832
I've been doing
my homework,
reading books and stuff.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.534
What, Evil For Dummies?

30:02.567 --> 30:06.838
I mean, look at you,
all puffed up and mighty,

30:06.873 --> 30:08.539
thinking you're
the new Big Bad.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.875
It's, uh...

30:11.877 --> 30:14.980
well, let's face it.
It's adorable.

30:15.013 --> 30:18.884
You just can't stand
the fact that
I'm my own person now.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.786
There comes a time
in every woman's life

30:20.818 --> 30:23.021
when she realizes
she needs to take
the next step.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.324
I've taken it.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.727
I've found the real me,
and I like her.

30:30.561 --> 30:32.530
Hope you'll be
very happy together.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.801
In the meantime,
save Slayer slaying
for the professionals.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.337
(sighs)
You'll see.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.540
Buffy'll be dead
by sunrise.
I've got a plan.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.911
Let me guess.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.180
Snatch one of her friends,
use him as bait,
lead her into a trap.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.981
That sort of thing?

30:50.016 --> 30:53.384
No.
Much, much better one.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.055
I'm not gonna tell you.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.226
Thought as much.
Best of luck.

31:00.259 --> 31:03.528
Let me know how
this arch villain thing
works out for you.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.365
I'll do that.
And after Buffy is gone,

31:06.397 --> 31:11.136
I'm gonna kill everybody
in this town that was
ever mean to me... Spike!

31:16.642 --> 31:18.144
Guys, new plan.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.782
That's a lot of weapons for
somebody you weren't sweating
20 minutes ago.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.385
Well, that was before
Dawn gave Harmony
a backstage pass

31:27.419 --> 31:30.189
to kill us all
in our sleep.
Buff, I left word with Willow.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.790
She'll come do
a return engagement
of her un-invitation spell.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.526
She probably still has
the stuff from last week.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.028
And bang, boom,
you're back in
a fortress of solitude.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.432
All better.
No. Not all better.

31:40.465 --> 31:44.135
I mean, it's not like Dawn
hasn't grown up in this house
knowing all the rules.

31:44.170 --> 31:47.439
Especially the biggie,
numero one-oh--

31:47.472 --> 31:50.942
"Do not invite
bloodsucking dead people
into our home."

31:52.010 --> 31:53.412
I mean, please.

31:53.444 --> 31:55.580
I would never
have Harmony over
even when she was alive.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.951
People slip, Buffy.
Your Mom did.

31:58.984 --> 32:03.788
She invited in
the mast--
Dracula in for coffee.

32:05.124 --> 32:08.126
Well, that was different.
I mean, she--

32:09.295 --> 32:10.429
He would--

32:12.163 --> 32:14.232
She was lonely,
and-and--

32:14.266 --> 32:16.734
and she didn't know
he was a vampire.

32:16.768 --> 32:20.638
The vampire.
Meanwhile, Dawn knew
exactly what Harmony was

32:20.672 --> 32:22.141
when she rolled out
the welcome mat for her.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.309
RILEY:
She's just a kid.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.577
You know, will everybody
please stop saying that?

32:26.612 --> 32:29.115
I was just a kid when
I met my first vampire,

32:29.147 --> 32:31.150
but somehow
I still managed
to remember the rules.

32:31.182 --> 32:33.285
You had to.
It was your job.

32:33.318 --> 32:36.322
No. No,
it was common sense.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.157
But nobody expects
even that much
from Dawn, do they?

32:39.191 --> 32:42.193
No, she has to be
protected and coddled
from the big bad world.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.262
Well, you know what?
We are doing nothing

32:44.296 --> 32:47.365
but turning her into
a little idiot who is
going to get us all killed.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.978
She just has
to be more careful.

33:00.011 --> 33:03.148
I can't be there
to protect her
24 hours a day.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.051
I-I just can't.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.424
Hey, don't!

33:15.861 --> 33:17.063
Dawn!

33:22.733 --> 33:25.203
What do you think
you're doing?
Leave me alone.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.874
I will, after you
come back inside the house.
Let go of me!

33:28.906 --> 33:31.210
No. It's not safe out here.
(gasps)

33:31.242 --> 33:33.912
You got that right.
(screams)

33:35.381 --> 33:38.049
(screams)

33:42.121 --> 33:44.522
(screaming continues)

33:50.895 --> 33:52.029
Anya!

34:00.405 --> 34:02.607
Vampires took...

34:02.641 --> 34:04.809
This head wound looks bad.
We'd better get her
to a hospital.

34:05.810 --> 34:08.547
They took her.
Easy, An. Shh.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.416
ANYA: Dawn.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.018
Dawn?
What about Dawn?

34:14.052 --> 34:16.588
She ran out.
They took her.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.422
Vampires.

34:19.989 --> 34:23.061
Oh, God. Oh, God.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.963
Uh, take care of Anya.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.297
Buffy!

34:27.898 --> 34:31.936
All right. Once again,
nice work, minionators.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.405
I'm really, really proud
of you guys.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.775
Ah, Mort.

34:36.806 --> 34:40.112
I trust you made
our guest... comfortable?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.681
You told me
to chain her to a wall.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.918
Yeah, I know.
I'm being, you know,

34:46.952 --> 34:48.786
sarcastic or whatever?

34:48.820 --> 34:52.257
Anyway,
I'm feeling really good

34:52.291 --> 34:54.126
about this new plan, people.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.827
I think it's a winner.
When do we eat the girl?

34:56.862 --> 34:59.331
We don't.
Not yet.

34:59.364 --> 35:04.001
Why not?
Because that's not the plan.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.972
(sighs)
Do I have to go
over the plan again?

35:07.005 --> 35:09.175
We use the sister
as bait.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.478
We send Buffy a note.
More notes?

35:14.213 --> 35:16.181
We send Buffy a note

35:16.215 --> 35:18.083
telling her that
if she wants to see
her sister again,

35:18.115 --> 35:21.619
she has to come alone
to a place we choose.

35:21.652 --> 35:25.157
She comes. We jump her.
We kill her.

35:25.190 --> 35:28.527
So it doesn't really matter
if we're actually holding
the Slayer's sister.

35:28.559 --> 35:32.331
Just as long as
she thinks we are,
she'll walk into the trap.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.432
I guess.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.768
So it won't make
any difference
if we eat the girl now.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.103
We're not
eating the girl.

35:39.137 --> 35:43.409
Why not?
'Cause that's not
the plan.

35:52.983 --> 35:55.286
Bollocks.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.824
Gonna have to pinch me one
of those satellite dishes.
(door crashes open)

35:58.856 --> 36:02.159
Well, speaking of dishes,
to what do I owe
this unpleasant--

36:02.193 --> 36:03.961
Ow! Bloody hell!

36:03.994 --> 36:07.398
I don't have time
for banter, Spike.
Where's Harmony's lair?

36:07.432 --> 36:10.969
Haven't seen her
in months.
How should I know-- ow!

36:11.001 --> 36:14.972
Where is she?
At least
lay off the nose.

36:15.005 --> 36:17.041
Okay, okay!

36:17.074 --> 36:19.411
Used to have a cave
in the north woods.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.679
About 40 meters
past the overpass
construction site.

36:22.713 --> 36:23.748
Ow!

36:23.782 --> 36:26.717
I was telling you
the truth!

36:26.751 --> 36:27.786
I know.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.826
(sighs)
They don't respect me.
They pretend they do,

36:34.860 --> 36:37.262
but deep down
they think I'm nothing.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.065
I mean, I'm the one
who put this group together.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.768
Me, but they treat me
like I don't even matter.

36:43.902 --> 36:47.373
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

36:47.405 --> 36:48.606
A little.

36:48.639 --> 36:52.277
They have no idea
how much pressure I'm under.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.445
I have to make
all the hard decisions,

36:54.480 --> 36:56.947
and it's hard.
(gasps)

36:59.284 --> 37:02.588
Excuse me.
I didn't hear anybody knock.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.757
We've been talking it over,
and we decided
we don't like this plan.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.126
Except for Brad.
He abstained.

37:09.159 --> 37:12.797
Oh, really?
You have a plan
you like better?

37:12.831 --> 37:15.032
We're gonna feed on the girl
and kill you.

37:15.065 --> 37:17.135
Maybe not in that order.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.739
I don't think I like
your attitude, Mort.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.143
Kill him for me.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.650
All right.
You're all on my list.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.458
Th-this isn't fair.
Okay, so things
haven't been perfect.

37:40.492 --> 37:43.795
I just need a little
more time to grow
into my leadership role.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.331
Time's up.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.465
(whimpering)

37:52.036 --> 37:54.340
T-touch me,
and my sister's
gonna kill you.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.378
(all laughing)

38:09.387 --> 38:11.188
Can't say
she didn't warn him.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.324
And you didn't like the plan.

38:13.358 --> 38:14.860
Dawn, close your eyes.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.197
So, Slayer,
at last we meet.

38:19.230 --> 38:22.000
We've met, Harmony,
you half-wit.

38:22.032 --> 38:25.436
I'm the half-wit?
Um, excuse me,

38:25.471 --> 38:27.204
but look who's
fallen into my--

38:32.077 --> 38:33.679
(yells)

38:36.246 --> 38:37.782
Trap.

38:37.815 --> 38:42.152
Harmony, when you tried
to be head cheerleader,
you were bad.

38:42.186 --> 38:45.222
When you tried chair of
the homecoming committee,
you were really bad.

38:45.255 --> 38:48.893
But when you try
to be bad, you suck.

38:50.094 --> 38:51.195
Buffy, watch out!

38:55.333 --> 38:57.469
Oh, good shot, Mort.
I think you
got her on the--

38:57.503 --> 39:00.505
Um--
(nervous chuckle)

39:22.293 --> 39:23.961
(groaning)

39:53.291 --> 39:55.092
(panting)

40:04.902 --> 40:08.806
You are going to be
in so much trouble
when we get home!

40:08.840 --> 40:12.210
Yeah, well,
I'm telling Mom
you slayed in front of me.

40:12.242 --> 40:16.481
Fine. I'll just tell her
that you ran out of the house
in the middle of the night,

40:16.514 --> 40:20.485
that you got Anya hurt,
invited a vampire in,
got kidnapped.

40:31.195 --> 40:32.963
Sorry it ran so late.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.365
Everything go okay?

40:37.202 --> 40:39.938
Yeah, yeah.
You know.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.072
I got the vamps,
and we watched some TV.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.610
Well, I know
at least one of us

40:44.643 --> 40:46.210
who's supposed to be
in bed by now.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.550
Good night.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.322
So, how was the exhibit?
Oh, it was fantastic.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.157
DAWN:
 Buffy probably would have
 gotten in way more trouble

41:00.190 --> 41:01.793
than me, anyway.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.094
But I guess it was
 pretty okay of her

41:04.128 --> 41:06.130
not to say
 anything to Mom.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.833
Anya's gonna be okay,
 and Xander wasn't mad at me,

41:08.867 --> 41:11.268
so stuff mostly
 worked out.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.105
BUFFY: Giles,
are you sure about this?
Why wouldn't I be?

41:14.139 --> 41:16.206
Well, aside from
the fact that

41:16.240 --> 41:18.876
most magic shop owners
in Sunnydale have
the life expectancy

41:18.909 --> 41:22.813
of a Spinal Tap drummer,
and have you ever run
a store before?

41:22.847 --> 41:25.483
I was a librarian for years.
This is exactly the same,

41:25.516 --> 41:27.952
except people
pay for the things
they never return.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.322
It'll give me focus,
help increase my resources,

41:31.356 --> 41:35.025
and it'll prevent you lot
from trampling all over
my flat at all hours.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.695
There may even be
some space for you
to train in the back.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.664
Boy, you've really
thought this through.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.300
How bored were you
last year?

41:42.333 --> 41:45.637
I watched Passions
with Spike.
Let us never speak of it.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.606
(Buffy laughing)

41:52.342 --> 41:54.411
Don't break anything.

41:59.217 --> 42:02.152
Just don't touch anything.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.222
DAWN:
 Not that Buffy's
 really changed at all.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.791
Like she ever would.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.728
What you're doing right now,
not moving?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.896
Good. Keep doing that.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.836
She still thinks
 I'm a little miss nobody,

42:18.869 --> 42:20.639
just her dumb
 little sister.

42:22.539 --> 42:25.476
Boy, is she in
 for a surprise.
