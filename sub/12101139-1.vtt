WEBVTT

00:11.112 --> 00:13.747
(anxious music)

00:29.430 --> 00:30.598
- [Lucy] Stop.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.066
- [Belle] What?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.734
- What do we do?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.536
- You have to keep going.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.505
We don't stop we outrun
that son of a bitch

00:37.605 --> 00:38.972
and we just keep going.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.608
- What if he never stops coming?

00:40.641 --> 00:41.675
What if we can't stop it?

00:41.675 --> 00:42.776
- We can do this, okay.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.879
Look at me.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.948
We just keep running
and we'll lose him.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.386
- I'm not sure if I want to
run away from what we had.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.987
I don't wanna never
see my family again.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.525
- But we had two
choices, money, a future,

00:57.525 --> 01:00.328
easy life or the same
shitty existence.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.329
We chose money.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.831
I'm not giving up this gold.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.867
- Are you sure about this?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.068
- [Belle] I couldn't
be more sure.

01:08.068 --> 01:08.869
- Okay.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.374
- [Belle] Look, we can have
a happy life, all right?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.008
We can have everything
we ever wanted.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.410
Fuck the past.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.146
He's just one obstacle.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.547
- Fuck the others?

01:19.547 --> 01:20.714
- They just didn't
make it, okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.883
I feel really shitty about that.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.652
But trust me, if it was
the other way round,

01:24.685 --> 01:25.853
they would do the same.

01:27.155 --> 01:27.955
- Bell, but--

01:27.988 --> 01:28.922
- No, no, buts.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.924
- This is ours, Lucy.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.528
We've committed to this.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.364
Now you either get
out of the car now

01:36.397 --> 01:37.731
or you continue on with me.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.568
You make a decision.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.069
You make it fast, Lucy.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.075
- Drive.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.445
(engine turning over)

01:51.512 --> 01:52.280
- Bollock.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.185
- What's going on?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.286
- I don't know,
it's not starting.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.387
- Bell, drive!

02:00.521 --> 02:01.289
- I can't.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.257
(evil laughing)

02:03.291 --> 02:04.925
- [Lucy] What's going on?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.360
- Give me, me gold.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.830
(tense music)

02:17.271 --> 02:19.807
(air swishing)

02:24.845 --> 02:27.648
(Belle screaming)

02:28.649 --> 02:30.117
- [Lucy] Can't see, I can't see.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.719
- [Leprechaun] What's wrong?

02:31.752 --> 02:34.322
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.962
(anxious music)

02:53.841 --> 02:54.642
(Lucy screaming)

02:54.642 --> 02:57.077
(ax thudding)

03:08.522 --> 03:11.359
(thunder crashing)

03:29.843 --> 03:32.613
(rain pattering)

03:32.646 --> 03:34.448
- [Belle] Where is he?

03:44.024 --> 03:46.960
(thunder rumbling)

04:05.045 --> 04:06.547
(coins jingling)

04:06.647 --> 04:10.150
(muffled thudding)

04:10.250 --> 04:13.354
(coins jingling)

04:13.354 --> 04:15.989
(evil laughing)

04:18.926 --> 04:21.629
(coins jingling)

04:25.399 --> 04:28.001
(upbeat music)

05:41.842 --> 05:43.110
- How long have you known?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.080
Misha?

05:51.752 --> 05:52.920
- A few weeks.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.689
- Well, I didn't know
when to tell you,

05:55.723 --> 05:57.024
when the time was right.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.996
- Why did you then wait
so long to tell me?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.937
- It wasn't easy to come
to terms with myself.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.576
We haven't even had money
to celebrate Christmas.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.044
You know, things have
been tight recently.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.278
We've got no money, Karl.

06:21.849 --> 06:22.650
- I know.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.955
And now that we have a kid
coming into this picture.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.327
- Don't worry.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.537
- What?

06:43.571 --> 06:45.639
- Well, don't worry about
any of it, it's fine.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.208
- What are you saying?

06:48.241 --> 06:51.044
(worrisome music)

06:53.413 --> 06:54.482
- I can abort the kid.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.185
- No.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.055
We got this, okay?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.891
We're gonna be all right.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.927
Like they say, when there's
a will, there's a way.

07:06.927 --> 07:07.728
Okay?

07:12.365 --> 07:13.166
- Karl.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.505
- [DJ] After this new
chat by Frankie FC,

07:17.571 --> 07:18.972
and this is called Macronica.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.240
(upbeat music)

07:20.240 --> 07:23.611
(cellular phone ringing)

07:27.080 --> 07:27.881
- Hey, Marshall.

07:29.082 --> 07:29.883
- [Marshall] What's
happening, Karl.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.519
You got a minute?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.253
- Sure, go for it.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.489
- [Marshall] Look, I've
got another job coming.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.725
Not the type or
anything like that.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.760
It's a weird one, but
I've got a feeling,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.361
you're gonna like this one.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.931
Gonna go meet him
later for the deal.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.400
- Look, mate, I don't wanna
do anymore dodgy work.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.070
I'm done with this shit,
especially the last time.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.006
- [Marshall] Listen, you've
got my word, I promise you,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.375
you're not gonna be in
anything like the last time.

07:55.408 --> 07:59.212
- Look mate, you can't keep
promises in this line of work.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.448
Christ, we almost
ended up arrested.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.884
That was fucked up, man.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.054
- [Marshall] Listen
calm down, bro yeah.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.557
Come with me to the meeting
and if you like it okay,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.892
if not I'll still respect you.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.761
You know, but I have a
feeling you're really gonna

08:13.794 --> 08:16.163
want in on this one.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.466
Plus all that extra
cash will help, huh?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.272
- Okay, where do you wanna meet?

08:28.676 --> 08:31.444
(sirens blaring)

08:36.016 --> 08:37.484
Marshall.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.886
- How's it going, mate?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.788
- Been better, fine.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.856
- Good, what's about being
about the missus, good?

08:42.856 --> 08:43.857
- Fine.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.792
- [Marshall] Good, good.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.093
- So what is this job offer?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.595
- That I still don't know.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.963
We're gonna go and see him
about the details of it.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.632
I think it's an in and out job.

08:51.665 --> 08:55.636
Pick one up give him the money,
cash, go grab, that's it.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.804
- All right.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.238
- You're down, yeah?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.372
- Let's go.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.207
- You ready?

09:03.711 --> 09:06.346
(door knocking)

09:08.348 --> 09:09.683
- Thanks for coming.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.684
John.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.185
Nice to meet you.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.154
You must be Marshall?

09:14.187 --> 09:14.988
- Good guess.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.991
- And your friend?

09:19.126 --> 09:21.328
- He's actually my
business partner, Karl.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.295
- Business partner.

09:31.404 --> 09:36.409
So I need someone who
can do a job for me.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.613
A quick in and out, no hassle.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.883
- You've come to the
right people, my friend.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.853
- That's very reassuring.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.391
- So, what is this that
you want us to collect?

09:52.559 --> 09:56.363
- Well, you may think
I'm a bit crazy,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.799
but I'm a collector.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.937
I collect proof of other beings.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.840
- Other beings?

10:08.441 --> 10:12.045
- I've always had a weird
fascination in knowing there

10:12.079 --> 10:16.083
is more life out there
than we truly comprehend.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.890
You name it, I own it, nearly.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.193
- What, like Father
Christmas (chuckles)?

10:27.627 --> 10:31.799
- Now you may think this
is some kind of a joke,

10:31.799 --> 10:35.669
but what we're dealing
with here, is far more

10:35.769 --> 10:38.872
than we can ever understand.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.208
(suspenseful music)

10:41.241 --> 10:46.046
Over the years, I've
collected such trophies

10:46.046 --> 10:50.517
as Bigfoot's claw, a Yeti's fur,

10:52.953 --> 10:57.758
the sack that Krampus used
to collect his children.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.961
(Marshall laughing)

11:00.961 --> 11:03.563
- Sorry is this
some kind of sell?

11:03.596 --> 11:04.397
Sorry.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.635
- This is why I pay good money.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.604
There is a risk.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.973
You won't believe me,

11:14.007 --> 11:15.809
but if I pay you well,

11:16.910 --> 11:20.313
that is the incentive
for you to go

11:20.313 --> 11:22.816
and collect what I desire.

11:22.883 --> 11:23.683
Right?

11:24.752 --> 11:26.519
- Yes, sir, everyone
has a price.

11:28.155 --> 11:28.956
- Good.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.294
- So what do you want this
time, Rapunzel's hair?

11:34.327 --> 11:36.997
(Marshall laughing)

11:36.997 --> 11:41.068
- I want the Leprechauns gold.

11:44.171 --> 11:44.972
- Right.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.510
- At the end of the
rainbow is his gold.

11:52.012 --> 11:56.850
I want you to go and collect
it and bring it to me.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.987
- So you would like us to
find a little pot of gold,

12:00.053 --> 12:01.488
that's at the end
of the rainbow.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.322
- Yes.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.328
- So if it's that simple,
why did you need us to go?

12:08.361 --> 12:13.000
- Ah, now this is where
I need you and your men.

12:14.868 --> 12:19.873
If you go, there is a risk
that you may lose you're life.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.344
- Hold up, you want
me and my friends

12:24.411 --> 12:26.313
and my team to lose our lives?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.517
- These are dangerous beings,

12:30.517 --> 12:32.786
creatures that we
are dealing with.

12:36.056 --> 12:41.028
Acting upon impulse, they will
fight to keep what is theirs.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.331
- How much we talking?

12:47.600 --> 12:52.572
- I will give you 100,000 pounds

12:53.406 --> 12:54.574
for the sack of gold.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.413
- And if we don't deliver?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.249
- Nothing.

13:03.483 --> 13:07.287
- Wait, you're sending
us on a wild goose chase

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
and we might not
even get the money.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.425
We'd have to be reimbursed and
have something for our time.

13:14.194 --> 13:19.199
- I will pay you 1000
pounds each for your time.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.534
Fair?

13:24.271 --> 13:26.039
- A grant is a grant.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.611
- Its a deal.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.445
Shake it.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.225
(anxious music)

13:45.325 --> 13:46.793
This guy is off his tits.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.729
- Bro, a grand is a grand.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.166
- So what are you thinking?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.734
- What am I thinking?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.803
I'm thinking we get this done.

13:59.806 --> 14:04.011
- Such a completely
wasted chase.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.479
I mean, no leprechaun exists.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.681
- Listen, you know that
as well as I know that,

14:08.748 --> 14:10.683
let's just get this
grand and fuck off.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.652
- Okay.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.486
When?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.856
- Well I'm hearing it's
a little risky one.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.527
So I'm thinking we could
hire a couple of local lads.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.395
Split the payment.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.496
How does that sound?

14:24.965 --> 14:28.535
- Give 'em 500 and
we keep the rest.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.869
- And it sounds good to me.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.471
There's my business partner.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.441
(glasses tickling)

14:36.643 --> 14:39.646
(suspenseful music)

14:41.214 --> 14:43.883
(Tammy coughing)

14:50.657 --> 14:51.724
- How are you feeling?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.962
- I'm better, thank you, honey.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.333
- I'm gonna go out
for a bit, all right?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.368
- [Tammy] Where you're going?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.238
- I have an odd job, kind of
thing, that's needs seeing to.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.477
- Please, don't tell me
you're not going back

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
to that line of work?

15:12.045 --> 15:12.845
Please?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.715
Ruby?

15:15.715 --> 15:16.516
Look at me.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.553
- It's not like before.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.256
But I need the cash, all right?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.160
I need to sort
this situation out.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.930
- We can find ways.

15:30.964 --> 15:34.267
- No, I will find us a way.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.337
You need professional help.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.373
Help, I can't afford to get you

15:40.407 --> 15:42.242
in a better state
with your health.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.246
I got this, all right?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
You trust me, don't you?

15:53.886 --> 15:54.687
- Always.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.527
- Then trust when I tell
you everything is all okay.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.910
(Tammy coughing)

16:19.546 --> 16:22.215
(birds singing)

16:25.285 --> 16:26.919
- We're a little
bit exposed here.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.756
- What are we doing
here, Marshall?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.324
- This better be good.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.926
- Look, we've been hired to
do a job, a quick in and out.

16:35.095 --> 16:35.895
- The woods.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.933
- Look, some fool has hired
me and Karl to find something.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.935
If we find it, we
get a hundred grand.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.637
If not, we get one
K for our time.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.438
Sound fair?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.775
- This better be no
longer than an hour.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.079
My going rate is usually one K.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.081
- Fuck me, I'll
take one K an hour.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.449
- Look, it's not gonna
take long at all, yeah.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.985
- [Ruby] How can you be so sure?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.653
- [Tim] Fuck the
time, I want my 100 K.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.089
What do we need to get?

17:04.524 --> 17:05.925
- See over there, my friends?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.494
You find the end
of that rainbow,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.762
you'll find yourself
a sack of gold.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.998
If not, we get one
K for our time.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.067
So let's go find some
gold, my friends.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.936
- You've gotta be shitting me?

17:17.003 --> 17:19.172
Pot of gold at the
end of a rainbow.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.640
- [Marshall] Look, stranger
things have happened

17:20.640 --> 17:22.309
to me in my life.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.511
- Someone's actually
paying you for this?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.147
- Listen, it's a trusted
payer, dealt with him before,

17:27.214 --> 17:29.849
so go find yourself
some gold, my friends.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.287
- All right.
- Let's do it.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.889
(gentle music)

18:10.257 --> 18:13.092
(mysterious music)

19:31.438 --> 19:34.073
(birds singing)

19:40.480 --> 19:43.316
- This is ridiculous.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.685
- Yeah, granted,
it's weird as fuck.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.488
But 100 K, do you
know what I mean?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.756
What can you do
with a hundred K?

19:49.756 --> 19:51.758
Kind of grand if we fuck up.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.963
- I mean, I could get me a
new Louis Vuitton with that.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.931
- Yeah, you do love you Louis V.

19:58.965 --> 19:59.766
- [Nel] I do.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.478
(coins jingling)

20:11.511 --> 20:12.312
- Hey, guys!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.047
Guys, over here.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.794
- Find yourself a
pot of gold yet?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.497
- This is crazy.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.331
- It is.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.667
But as he said, stranger things.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.171
So how did you get
involved in this?

20:39.205 --> 20:42.208
I thought you were
out of it last time.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.610
- I was out.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.479
But something crept up.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.514
Now I need the money.

20:49.081 --> 20:54.053
- With what happened last
time, it was a mistake.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.723
It shouldn't have
ended up like that.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.024
I hope you know that, right?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.763
- It wouldn't make
it any different

21:04.964 --> 21:07.033
when you guys left
me behind, huh?

21:07.066 --> 21:09.469
- Still banging on
about job gone wrong?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.203
Wrong place, wrong
time, my friend.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.171
No more to say.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.239
- Oh, easy said than done.

21:14.707 --> 21:19.446
I could've ended up in prison
for 15 fucking years, mate.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.448
- Yeah well, you didn't.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.551
You're here and you're
fine, so let's move on, hey.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.954
- [Marshall] Hey, guys!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.122
Guys.
- Fuck up.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.397
(group cheering)

21:37.397 --> 21:39.065
- [Karl] Hey, what is it?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.133
- [Marshall] I
can't believe this.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.770
- [Mick] Shit, man,
we're rich, bitches!

21:43.803 --> 21:45.972
- I literally can't
believe I'm saying this.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.074
- [Tim] That's not possible.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.075
- [Marshall] Turns
out you can find

21:49.108 --> 21:52.912
the end of a fucking rainbow.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.414
- [Ruby] What's
inside that pack?

21:54.447 --> 21:57.083
- Who's ready to be filthy
fucking rich, people?

21:57.116 --> 21:59.118
Look, think of
what I'm thinking,

21:59.151 --> 22:01.488
this is worth more than
his measly 100 grand.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.955
We're literally
sitting on hundreds

22:02.989 --> 22:04.924
of thousands of
pounds here, people.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.025
- You gonna keep it?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.827
- Am I fucking gonna keep it?

22:07.827 --> 22:08.895
Finders keepers.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.430
- (laughs) You the man.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.065
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, how
much is this worth really?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.968
- It's about half a mill.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.771
Like that's a 100 K each.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.441
(Mick laughing)

22:23.976 --> 22:26.479
(upbeat music)

22:34.320 --> 22:38.224
* It's being so long ago
since I held you in my arms *

22:38.290 --> 22:43.295
* It's being so right, I
live through your charms *

22:44.130 --> 22:45.131
- Here we go, ladies.

22:46.132 --> 22:46.866
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:46.866 --> 22:47.967
- There we go.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.001
Chi-ching.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.337
This is petrol station's finest.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.005
Picked it over on my way up.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.907
Phoebe loves it, anyway.

22:55.007 --> 22:55.808
- How is Phoebe?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.043
- Oh, she's all right.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.244
She don't know about
the money yet though.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.512
- Oh, a surprise.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.547
- It's gonna be a
little toot tonight.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.881
- A toast.

23:01.948 --> 23:02.749
To us.

23:03.816 --> 23:04.984
- [Al] To us.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.152
(glasses tinkling)
(group cheering)

23:06.152 --> 23:07.353
- Yeah, baby.

23:07.353 --> 23:10.557
- My friends, take your
portion and live well.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.525
Live like fucking
well, my friends.

23:16.929 --> 23:17.730
Another?

23:22.201 --> 23:24.471
- Are you sure about this?

23:24.571 --> 23:25.705
- What'd you mean am I sure?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.106
This is my first
glass of the night.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.777
- That's not what
I'm talking about.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.845
I mean, what if he...

23:34.046 --> 23:38.485
I don't know, what if
he's looking for it?

23:38.518 --> 23:40.520
And comes after us.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.254
- Comes after us?

23:42.288 --> 23:43.890
Well, I suggest
you start spending.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.358
Spend, spend, spend, buddy.

23:46.392 --> 23:50.329
Book a flight, take a holiday,
put a deposit on a house.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.198
That's what I'm gonna do.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.000
- You're not intimidated by him?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.936
- This guy asked us to
help a leprechaun's gold,

23:56.969 --> 23:57.770
don't panic.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.443
- Babe, I'm home.

24:07.046 --> 24:07.847
Sweetie?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.551
You in bed?

24:40.547 --> 24:41.748
- [Answering Machine] I'm sorry,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.816
but the person you've
called is not available.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.785
Please leave your
message after the tone.

24:45.785 --> 24:46.719
(cellular phone beeping)

24:46.753 --> 24:47.920
- Hey, sweetie.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.122
I'm at home, where are you?

24:50.122 --> 24:51.791
Give me a call back.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.827
I've got some, I've got
some good news, yeah.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.162
Speak to you soon.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.611
(muffled giggling)

25:17.283 --> 25:18.651
Is someone there?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.320
Babe?

25:43.810 --> 25:44.877
- Wha, got ya!
(Mick groaning)

25:44.877 --> 25:46.012
- Oh, shit.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.346
You scared the life out of me.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.514
- [Phoebe] I had to.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.149
'Cause what you did
to me last time.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.718
- Yeah, but you're a bad girl.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.320
I have...

25:56.188 --> 25:57.790
I've got some good news for you.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.893
Really good news.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.730
I've come into a
little bit of money.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.164
- You promised me you
wouldn't fuck about

26:05.197 --> 26:06.432
with those guys again.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.567
- Babe, nah-nah.

26:08.601 --> 26:09.602
It's nothing like that, babe.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.370
It's nothing like that at all.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.573
I just might to have happened
to have won the lottery.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.545
- (laughs) Say that again.

26:19.612 --> 26:20.479
What?

26:20.512 --> 26:22.414
- Maybe won the lottery.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.883
- How much?

26:23.883 --> 26:24.984
- Just 100 K.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.553
- What?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.388
No ways?
- Yeah.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.658
Serious, 100 K.
- No way.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.033
(couple giggling)

26:46.906 --> 26:48.507
- [Mick] What does it feel like.

26:48.574 --> 26:49.776
Feels good to be rich?

26:49.809 --> 26:50.710
- [Phoebe] Huh-uh.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.544
So what you gonna buy me?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.881
- [Mick] Well, I'm paying
you in kind, you know that.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.048
- [Phoebe] Go away.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.249
(couple laughing)

26:57.283 --> 26:58.284
- [Mick] I'm joking.

27:02.088 --> 27:02.889
Oh, baby.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.957
- [Phoebe] Ow.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.358
- [Mick] Oh, watch
your head there, love.

27:06.392 --> 27:09.195
(couple laughing)

27:12.231 --> 27:13.766
You know, I'm gonna go
grab a shower, babe.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.935
- All right.
- It's being a long day and...

27:17.770 --> 27:18.871
- [Phoebe] Don't
be too long, yeah?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.206
- Yeah, you just thinking about

27:20.206 --> 27:21.874
how you're gonna spend my money.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.710
- [Phoebe] Yeah, I gotta figure
out how to spend that cash.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.077
(couple laughing)

27:25.111 --> 27:28.614
- [Mick] I'm sure
you'll have a long list.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.283
- Hot.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.086
(water splashing)

27:35.955 --> 27:38.791
(muffled giggling)

27:49.802 --> 27:52.805
(suspenseful music)

28:18.297 --> 28:19.866
(Phoebe screaming)

28:19.866 --> 28:21.033
- Where is it?

28:22.634 --> 28:23.602
- Where is what?

28:23.602 --> 28:24.403
- Me gold.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.679
(dramatic music)

28:33.813 --> 28:36.615
(Phoebe coughing)

28:41.988 --> 28:44.957
(water splashing)

28:44.957 --> 28:48.127
(anxious music)

28:48.127 --> 28:48.928
- Babe?

28:50.696 --> 28:52.331
You all right, babe?

29:11.050 --> 29:13.719
(dramatic music)

29:17.123 --> 29:18.557
- Run!

29:18.557 --> 29:21.360
(Phoebe coughing)

29:22.361 --> 29:24.831
(Mick groaning)

29:24.897 --> 29:27.867
(suspenseful music)

29:45.651 --> 29:46.785
- Who are you?

29:48.254 --> 29:49.889
- What do you think I am?

29:49.922 --> 29:52.124
(Mick groaning)

29:52.124 --> 29:52.925
Thief.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.495
You all just thief's.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.530
You can talk to her soon.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.969
(Mick gasping)

30:03.002 --> 30:05.704
(mystical music)

30:08.007 --> 30:11.077
What do you think
happens to thief's?

30:31.163 --> 30:33.165
(evil laughing)

30:33.232 --> 30:35.767
(gentle music)

30:39.171 --> 30:40.106
- Oh my god.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.075
What's all this?

30:46.045 --> 30:46.845
Come on, tell me.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.548
- I, um...

30:52.584 --> 30:53.752
Shit, how do I say this?

30:56.322 --> 30:57.289
We're gonna be fine.

30:59.025 --> 30:59.791
- Huh?

31:01.027 --> 31:04.430
- Me, you and the little one.

31:05.731 --> 31:06.732
- Did you get a job?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.335
- Yeah.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.536
I got a job today.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.172
I got paid very handsomely.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.842
- You've got to be kidding me?

31:17.977 --> 31:18.744
- What?

31:20.346 --> 31:21.680
- No, you promised.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.515
You promised that
after the last time.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.954
Please tell me that I'm wrong?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.024
- It's a lot of money.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.129
- And what did you have
to do for this money?

31:37.163 --> 31:38.397
- You'll never believe me.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.000
- Try me.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.007
- [Ruby] Tammy?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.241
- Ruby.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.044
I thought you coming
back home late?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.879
I haven't got any
food sorted yet.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.147
Let me put the oven on.
- No.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.949
No cooking tonight.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.317
We're gonna celebrate.

32:00.486 --> 32:01.253
The job.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.088
Did me well.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.490
We are gonna be fine.

32:05.891 --> 32:06.692
- How much?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.329
- All you need to know is,
your medication is sorted.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.466
And for tonight, at
least, you're not cooking.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.403
We are going out.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.073
Finest place you can think of.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.409
Steak?

32:24.410 --> 32:25.711
You want it?

32:25.711 --> 32:26.512
You got it.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.450
- Please tell me wherever
you got this money from

32:31.483 --> 32:33.885
that it won't come
back to haunt you.

32:33.885 --> 32:34.686
- No.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.389
This is clean money.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.657
All right?

32:38.657 --> 32:39.425
No issues.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.895
It's over.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.034
Living this way.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.240
It's over.

32:58.744 --> 32:59.545
I told you.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.048
I told you, didn't I?

33:02.948 --> 33:05.751
(women chuckling)

33:10.156 --> 33:11.723
- So we have 100 K?

33:14.526 --> 33:15.994
- We have a 100 K.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.731
- And you're definitely
not shaming me.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.935
- Well, if we can manage to
sell it, it could be worth more.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.305
- Oh, christ.

33:27.806 --> 33:28.607
Oh my god.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.812
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.646
- It is.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.550
- Right, I love you.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.319
Well, lets do that
ever again, all right?

33:43.522 --> 33:44.890
- I love you too.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.433
(cat purring)

34:07.713 --> 34:11.117
(cellular phone buzzing)

34:20.626 --> 34:23.129
(cat purring)

34:24.563 --> 34:26.332
So what are we gonna
do about this gold?

34:26.332 --> 34:27.633
- What are we gonna do?

34:27.633 --> 34:29.401
I've got one of my
divas come around,

34:29.401 --> 34:31.203
hopefully we're gonna
sell our share of the gold

34:31.203 --> 34:32.704
and then get rich.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.806
That's what's gonna happen.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.676
- What about the guy
who originally hired
us to do the job?

34:37.676 --> 34:40.546
I mean, what are these
gonna go look for it.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.314
- Well, they shouldn't have
hired us for the job then,

34:42.348 --> 34:43.849
he should've done it himself.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.385
(men laughing)

34:47.886 --> 34:50.522
(door knocking)

34:59.931 --> 35:01.933
- Got something for me?

35:01.933 --> 35:04.670
(coins jingling)

35:09.641 --> 35:11.443
Right.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.078
Well, it sure is real gold.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.315
- Great.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.249
So--

35:17.283 --> 35:19.518
- So what do you want for it?

35:22.954 --> 35:23.989
What price?

35:25.491 --> 35:26.725
- Kind of like...

35:29.761 --> 35:33.832
- All right, we can take
a 100 K for this portion.

35:33.932 --> 35:37.436
If you want more, we can
get you in touch with others

35:37.436 --> 35:39.238
who can give you the rest.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.873
- (laughs) You're joking, right?

35:41.873 --> 35:43.074
A hundred K?

35:43.108 --> 35:44.610
For gold that doesn't
even have a certificate.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.879
And I don't have an inkling
of where it's come from.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.081
Let's say, the
police track me down.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.050
Let's say you two
get in the shit.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.919
Then I'll get in the shit.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.322
This is dodgy gold.

35:56.388 --> 35:59.024
And for that, we're gonna
need a discounted price.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.561
- Stew, you know the
price of the gold.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.563
We know the price of the gold.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.632
- 30 K.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.633
That's my offer.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.478
(anxious music)

36:36.828 --> 36:39.831
(suspenseful music)

37:23.074 --> 37:25.711
(evil laughing)

37:27.145 --> 37:29.815
(evil laughing)

37:32.083 --> 37:34.720
(evil laughing)

37:40.526 --> 37:43.161
(evil laughing)

38:00.078 --> 38:02.681
(evil laughing)

38:13.959 --> 38:15.160
- Nel?

38:15.226 --> 38:16.562
- I'm scared.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.963
- Are you all right?

38:17.963 --> 38:22.834
- Marshall, I think something's
after us for what we did.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.037
- What's going on, Nel?

38:26.071 --> 38:27.806
- I'm not joking
about, Marshall.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.809
- Nel, what's going on?

38:35.113 --> 38:38.083
(anxious music)

38:38.083 --> 38:38.917
Oh, my god.

39:25.163 --> 39:30.168
(knife whooshing)
(dramatic music)

39:39.511 --> 39:42.280
(knife thumping)

39:49.354 --> 39:52.057
(knife thudding)

39:55.326 --> 39:58.296
(cellular phone humming)

39:58.329 --> 39:59.631
- Hello?

39:59.631 --> 40:01.467
- Ruby, get down to Karl's now.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.435
- What is it?

40:04.670 --> 40:07.072
- No questions, I'll
spill when you get here.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.840
Just get the fuck
down here, yeah?

40:08.874 --> 40:09.841
Shit's hit the fan.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.517
(gentle organ music)

40:27.826 --> 40:30.195
- Thanks for meeting me here.

40:31.396 --> 40:32.731
- I haven't seen
you since school.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.668
- Two of your friends
have gone missing, Ruby.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.437
Nellona Fox and Mick Sybil.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.608
We're assuming foul play
due to the amount of blood

40:42.674 --> 40:44.476
found at the crime scenes.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.845
Both bodies must've
suffered an immense trauma.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.249
- I don't know what to say.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.588
- We have you on CCTV
a few days ago, Ruby.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.390
We have you, and
your friends meeting

40:59.491 --> 41:00.892
at the Dickings Wood Trail.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.295
Your all together and
within a matter of hours,

41:04.362 --> 41:05.363
two of them are gone.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.768
What were you doing down
that side of the woods?

41:12.437 --> 41:13.772
- We were having a reunion.

41:14.773 --> 41:15.707
Just catching up.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.844
- Just a year ago, Karl
was nearly arrested

41:18.877 --> 41:20.546
for a 10 year
sentence for robbery.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.248
We failed to find pure evidence,

41:23.281 --> 41:25.884
but you and your
friends were suspected

41:25.884 --> 41:27.886
to be involved in
this apparent robbery.

41:28.987 --> 41:29.888
Now, listen to me.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.692
If you are hiding
something or someone

41:33.692 --> 41:35.761
or you know more than
you want to tell me,

41:36.695 --> 41:38.764
I would advise speaking up now.

41:40.165 --> 41:40.966
- I know nothing.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.336
I don't know what
happened to them.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.773
And if I knew, I would tell you.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.876
- I don't feel like you're
telling me the whole truth.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.110
I'm trying to help you.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.312
Police aren't trying
to get in the way,

41:54.345 --> 41:56.682
be a pain, we are
trying to help.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.985
We solve crimes, you hear me?

42:01.853 --> 42:03.989
- I wish I could help
find where my friends are

42:03.989 --> 42:06.124
but I know nothing.

42:09.527 --> 42:14.165
- Whatever you lot are
messed up in, be careful.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.367
What ever's going on,
you could be next.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.772
If you remember anything,
just contact me.

42:21.607 --> 42:23.241
I'm just trying to help.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.175
That's all.

43:19.397 --> 43:22.333
(muffled giggling)

43:23.568 --> 43:26.772
- Ruby?

43:26.805 --> 43:29.808
(suspenseful music)

43:40.285 --> 43:42.087
(dramatic music)

43:42.087 --> 43:43.254
- Boo!

43:43.321 --> 43:45.123
(Tammy gasping)

43:45.123 --> 43:46.324
- What are you?

43:48.359 --> 43:49.527
- Where is it?

43:52.097 --> 43:52.864
- What?

43:55.466 --> 43:57.535
- Don't play games, mate.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.439
A double-spawn puppet.

44:05.110 --> 44:05.911
Me gold.

44:07.112 --> 44:08.113
Where is it?

44:10.849 --> 44:13.852
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.487
(anxious music)

44:16.521 --> 44:19.290
(Tammy groaning)

44:35.673 --> 44:38.309
(Tammy yelling)

44:45.917 --> 44:47.152
(bones cracking)

44:47.185 --> 44:48.987
- Nobody likes a liar.

45:00.866 --> 45:01.666
Oh.

45:03.668 --> 45:05.837
Never lie to a leprechaun.

45:09.507 --> 45:10.842
- Welcome.

45:10.876 --> 45:11.877
Take a seat.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.116
- Thank you.

45:18.149 --> 45:21.152
I really appreciate
you squeezing me in
at the last minute.

45:23.121 --> 45:23.922
- No problem.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.057
Is there anything in particular

45:26.057 --> 45:27.625
that you'd like
to focus on today?

45:27.692 --> 45:28.493
- Well, yes.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.529
- Go on.

45:34.165 --> 45:36.167
- I would like to ask
you about the job.

45:37.402 --> 45:40.205
- You're thinking of
a change in career?

45:40.205 --> 45:44.209
- No, about the job I
have taken on recently

45:44.242 --> 45:46.044
that I perhaps shouldn't have.

45:47.478 --> 45:51.116
I was desperate but now I'm
worried about the repercussions.

45:54.052 --> 45:56.855
- And you'd like me to
consult my spirit guide

45:56.888 --> 45:58.489
to see if anything
comes through?

45:58.523 --> 46:00.125
- Yes, please.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.526
I'm really worried.

46:01.559 --> 46:03.161
- Okay, well, let's begin.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.265
If you wouldn't mind
shuffling this deck.

46:07.265 --> 46:10.068
Only your energy channel
the right answers.

46:32.723 --> 46:35.360
First of all, I'm sensing
someone close to you.

46:37.028 --> 46:37.829
T.

46:40.265 --> 46:41.532
Tanya.

46:41.566 --> 46:42.400
- Tammy.

46:42.433 --> 46:44.035
Tammy, yes, Tammy.

46:45.436 --> 46:47.038
She has a weakened spirit light.

46:48.239 --> 46:50.375
May I ask, is she unwell?

46:51.709 --> 46:53.211
- Yes.

46:53.244 --> 46:55.446
That's the reason why I took
this job in the first place

46:56.647 --> 46:59.484
for us to make a better
life for both of us.

47:00.551 --> 47:02.287
She's weak, frail.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.923
- You're struggling to cope?

47:06.524 --> 47:08.159
I can sense a shift in energy.

47:09.627 --> 47:11.963
- I'm constantly worried.

47:11.997 --> 47:14.465
I'm just trying to
provide for both of us.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.868
- I see.

47:16.935 --> 47:18.569
My spirit guide senses an arc.

47:20.305 --> 47:23.108
A bright path made
of many colors.

47:23.174 --> 47:23.975
- Colors?

47:25.176 --> 47:26.611
- Yes.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.746
And at the end may not
lie what you're expecting.

47:30.315 --> 47:32.450
- You're not making much sense.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.119
- Black magic.

47:34.152 --> 47:35.520
- I'm sorry?

47:35.520 --> 47:37.688
- You've been dabbling
in black magic.

47:37.722 --> 47:40.825
- No, that's not why I'm here.

47:40.825 --> 47:42.360
- You are in danger.

47:42.427 --> 47:44.629
You must protect yourself.

47:44.695 --> 47:45.530
- From who?

47:45.563 --> 47:46.731
- From him.

47:46.764 --> 47:48.799
- From that guy,
that hired Marshall?

47:48.833 --> 47:50.068
- No.

47:50.168 --> 47:53.038
He's an evil entity
of the oldest kind.

47:53.038 --> 47:56.107
He spawns from the ancient
valleys of Ireland.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.175
- Who is this?

47:58.309 --> 48:00.811
- This is an entity,
not of human descent.

48:00.845 --> 48:02.480
- You can't be serious?

48:02.513 --> 48:04.682
- There is only one
way to stop him.

48:04.682 --> 48:05.850
- How?

48:05.883 --> 48:07.185
- The four leaf clover.

48:07.185 --> 48:09.454
- A four leaf clover?

48:09.487 --> 48:11.322
How is that going to help?

48:11.356 --> 48:13.959
- The magical properties of
the four leaves combined,

48:14.025 --> 48:17.996
faith, love, luck and hope
only these can overpower him.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.865
- Okay, I've had enough.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.968
I shouldn't have come here.

48:23.001 --> 48:24.269
You're nothing but a frog.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.872
- You must find the
four leaf clover

48:27.872 --> 48:28.839
to stop this evil spirit.

48:28.839 --> 48:30.475
You must end this.

48:30.575 --> 48:31.376
- Enough.

48:32.710 --> 48:35.213
- It can be found outside
the house of faith.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.882
(anxious music)

48:52.297 --> 48:53.831
- What is going on?

48:53.864 --> 48:55.266
- I've got things to be doing.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.267
Money to be spending.

48:58.236 --> 48:59.037
- They're dead.

49:04.775 --> 49:08.413
Mick and Nel, both murdered.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.816
No bodies, but excessive
blood at the crime scenes.

49:11.882 --> 49:14.885
- Wait, if there's no bodies,
then it could be anything.

49:14.885 --> 49:16.354
- Listen.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.356
My mate, Paul, who's just
joined the police force said

49:18.356 --> 49:20.925
that they're treating
this as a murder.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.393
Excessive blood.

49:22.493 --> 49:24.095
They had to treat
it as a murder.

49:25.896 --> 49:26.864
- You don't think...

49:28.066 --> 49:28.866
John?

49:31.169 --> 49:33.071
- Who else d'you think?

49:33.104 --> 49:34.305
Of course it's John.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.706
He's the one who
put us on this job

49:35.806 --> 49:37.808
and he's the one who
wants his gold back.

49:38.709 --> 49:40.045
- So what do we do about it?

49:41.279 --> 49:44.282
(suspenseful music)

49:45.883 --> 49:48.386
(gun clicking)

49:49.387 --> 49:50.988
- That's what we're gonna do.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.323
- Fuck, where'd
you get that from?

49:52.390 --> 49:55.193
- Listen, don't ask
me any questions.

49:55.226 --> 49:57.228
Don't worry about
where I got it from,

49:57.328 --> 50:00.398
worry about, I'm here to
protect you lot's arses.

50:01.966 --> 50:04.635
Listen, Nel phoned
me last night.

50:04.669 --> 50:05.803
Running from something.

50:07.605 --> 50:08.906
She was petrified.

50:10.441 --> 50:13.744
I think she was murdered.

50:15.480 --> 50:16.814
For fuck sake man.

50:20.085 --> 50:23.254
Listen, all of us, we
just gotta stick together.

50:23.288 --> 50:24.855
Stay in twos.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.291
No one's safe.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.326
Not one of us.

50:28.326 --> 50:31.129
As long as we're in this
thing together still.

50:31.162 --> 50:33.798
- And how do we deal with this?

50:33.831 --> 50:35.633
- How do we deal with this?

50:35.666 --> 50:37.635
First things first, we've
got to get to the root

50:37.635 --> 50:39.137
of this issue, yeah.

50:39.204 --> 50:41.506
Me and you, we're
gonna go see John.

50:41.506 --> 50:45.176
You two, stay here, don't
leave each other's side.

50:45.210 --> 50:46.411
No one's safe.

50:46.444 --> 50:48.613
Not as long as
we's got his gold.

50:48.646 --> 50:49.647
Serious.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.399
Listen, Karl, when
we go in the house,

51:08.466 --> 51:10.135
don't show any signs of fear,

51:10.168 --> 51:13.838
no signs of nerves and
we're gonna be a-okay.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.039
- Got ya.

51:15.039 --> 51:16.641
You think we're gonna be okay?

51:16.674 --> 51:18.676
- Listen, like I said before,

51:18.676 --> 51:21.679
if you didn't show any signs
of nerves, no fear, we're good.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.082
- You don't think he's
gonna do anything to us?

51:25.082 --> 51:28.085
- (chuckles) Listen,
we're good, man.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.526
- She's pregnant.

51:35.526 --> 51:36.327
Misha.

51:37.562 --> 51:39.029
- Shit, are you serious?

51:40.265 --> 51:41.466
- Yeah.

51:41.566 --> 51:43.734
So that's why I'm
a bit more on edge.

51:43.734 --> 51:44.569
More than usual.

51:45.770 --> 51:46.671
We need that money.

51:47.705 --> 51:49.507
And I want her to be okay.

51:49.574 --> 51:52.377
I need to be okay
for her and the baby.

51:53.844 --> 51:56.214
I don't want her to
grow up without a dad.

51:57.615 --> 51:58.916
'Cause I know what it's like.

51:58.916 --> 51:59.884
I had that before.

52:02.887 --> 52:04.555
- Listen, it's gonna be good.

52:04.589 --> 52:05.523
You've got my word.

52:08.359 --> 52:10.127
So what you want
a boy or a girl?

52:11.128 --> 52:11.929
- A girl.

52:13.764 --> 52:15.866
I want her to take after Misha.

52:15.866 --> 52:18.135
Fuck, having another
one of me running round.

52:18.169 --> 52:19.570
- (laughs) Your funny.

52:21.439 --> 52:22.240
- Right, let's go.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.231
- So you found it then?

52:46.297 --> 52:49.667
- Listen, just stop what you're
doing and leave us alone.

52:49.667 --> 52:50.968
- Excuse me?

52:51.001 --> 52:53.170
- Listen, two of our
men are dead, yeah.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.072
And we haven't got any
money to show for it.

52:55.105 --> 52:55.906
What's happening?

52:57.007 --> 53:00.211
(John laughing)

53:00.245 --> 53:01.011
- He's laughing.

53:01.045 --> 53:03.214
Is this a fucking joke?

53:03.281 --> 53:05.283
- You stupid fuckers.

53:05.283 --> 53:08.519
You've really gone and fucked
it up this time, haven't you?

53:08.519 --> 53:09.387
- Fucked what?

53:10.655 --> 53:13.624
- It's not me that's
taking your men down.

53:13.691 --> 53:16.994
That's where you've got
this twisted, you hear?

53:17.027 --> 53:17.928
- Who is it then?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.931
- The leprechaun.

53:20.965 --> 53:22.967
You took his gold.

53:22.967 --> 53:24.935
- Just stop fucking
with us, all right.

53:24.969 --> 53:26.437
- I'm not.

53:26.471 --> 53:30.975
And deep down, I think,
you know, I'm not.

53:35.813 --> 53:37.815
- Can't believe they're gone.

53:40.685 --> 53:42.320
- Think we could
split their cash?

53:49.827 --> 53:50.628
What?

53:53.931 --> 53:54.732
- Really?

53:57.167 --> 53:57.968
Oh, my god.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.572
I'm going to the bathroom.

54:08.212 --> 54:11.081
(muffled giggling)

54:14.719 --> 54:17.054
(suspenseful music)

54:17.121 --> 54:19.990
(muffled giggling)

54:56.961 --> 54:59.597
(birds singing)

55:09.607 --> 55:12.242
(anxious music)

56:04.695 --> 56:07.932
(keys clicking)

56:07.965 --> 56:10.768
- Oh, hey, Crypto's, it's
me, the daddy of doom.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.905
Thanks for joining me again
for this week's new entry.

56:15.005 --> 56:18.008
The leprechaun, true or false?

56:18.042 --> 56:20.478
The leprechaun has been
believed in for centuries,

56:20.478 --> 56:22.613
dating back to the 1800s.

56:22.647 --> 56:25.115
The leprechaun is said
to be an escaped demon

56:25.115 --> 56:27.918
who escaped from the
wrath of Leviathan.

56:27.952 --> 56:30.955
Leviathan is one of the seven
devils of the underworld.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.857
He is said to have
collected creatures

56:32.890 --> 56:34.792
and made them work
in the dark depths

56:34.792 --> 56:37.127
of the underworld for centuries.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.797
(birds singing)

57:14.832 --> 57:17.835
(suspenseful music)

57:51.435 --> 57:54.772
(muffled evil laughing)

58:31.175 --> 58:33.811
(anxious music)

59:19.724 --> 59:22.727
(suspenseful music)

1:00:15.045 --> 1:00:16.681
(knife thudding)
(dramatic music)

1:00:16.714 --> 1:00:19.283
(keys ticking)

1:00:23.353 --> 1:00:26.090
- Leviathan is one of the
seven devils of the underworld.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.925
He has said to have
collected creatures

1:00:27.925 --> 1:00:29.426
and made them work
in the dark depths

1:00:29.526 --> 1:00:31.729
of the underworld for centuries.

1:00:31.762 --> 1:00:34.765
It all goes back to the 1800s,
when a leprechaun was sent

1:00:34.865 --> 1:00:37.868
to earth to retrieve an
escape soul by Leviathan.

1:00:37.968 --> 1:00:40.070
The leprechaun was there
to retrieve the soul

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:43.573
however, this is where
it took a very dark turn,

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:46.243
the leprechaun got a
taste of the outside world

1:00:46.243 --> 1:00:47.712
and when he returned
with the soul,

1:00:47.745 --> 1:00:49.880
he told Leviathan that
he had paid his dues

1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:51.949
and was ready to live
in the mortal world.

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:55.119
However Leviathan
was not having it.

1:00:55.119 --> 1:00:58.723
And he said that the leprechaun
could not walk the earth

1:00:58.789 --> 1:01:01.158
and must live in the deep
darks of the cave below.

1:01:05.629 --> 1:01:06.430
- Please.

1:01:06.496 --> 1:01:07.732
Please don't do this.

1:01:07.765 --> 1:01:09.333
- Give me the gold, now!

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:11.168
- What the hell?

1:01:11.235 --> 1:01:12.737
This can't be happening.

1:01:12.770 --> 1:01:14.304
- Give me, me gold.

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:17.074
- I don't have it.

1:01:18.475 --> 1:01:20.077
- Where is it?

1:01:20.177 --> 1:01:21.145
- I spent it.

1:01:25.482 --> 1:01:26.283
No.

1:01:26.316 --> 1:01:27.317
No, no, please, don't.

1:01:27.317 --> 1:01:29.787
(Tim yelling)

1:01:32.356 --> 1:01:34.591
(match flickering)

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:38.028
(anxious music)

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:38.929
No, please!

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:45.035
- Sick and tired of it.

1:01:45.035 --> 1:01:47.037
The leprechaun is said
to have stolen a bucket

1:01:47.037 --> 1:01:50.307
of Leviathan's riches and
fled to the mortal world

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:53.010
going into hiding in
the hills of Ireland.

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:55.345
This is why the leprechaun
is known to hide

1:01:55.412 --> 1:01:56.881
like a cockroach.

1:01:56.947 --> 1:01:59.716
He hides amongst the living,
never wanting to be seen.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:02.152
A great trickster,
a talented hider,

1:02:02.186 --> 1:02:04.955
blending into any background.

1:02:04.989 --> 1:02:08.325
However, although the
legend goes, he is friendly,

1:02:08.325 --> 1:02:10.795
but he can turn on
a human in the drop

1:02:10.895 --> 1:02:14.164
of a heartbeat if
his gold is stolen.

1:02:14.164 --> 1:02:16.166
He sees his gold is a victory,

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.602
a victory of escaping
from the underworld.

1:02:18.635 --> 1:02:20.971
And if a human were
to steal his gold,

1:02:21.005 --> 1:02:24.241
he can open up a
wrath of anger inside.

1:02:24.241 --> 1:02:26.811
Now the leprechaun,
he may be small,

1:02:26.844 --> 1:02:29.413
but he has a golden box, which
is why he was originally sent

1:02:29.446 --> 1:02:31.148
to the underworld to begin with.

1:02:31.215 --> 1:02:32.850
He was a soul collector.

1:02:32.883 --> 1:02:34.318
He collected the souls of those

1:02:34.351 --> 1:02:36.353
who stole amongst the living.

1:02:36.386 --> 1:02:38.722
And he was sent to the
underworld for his crimes.

1:02:38.722 --> 1:02:40.925
Now, if you betray him, beware,

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:46.096
he is lurking,
waiting to collect.

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:47.998
Maybe to collect you.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:51.735
Well guys, thanks so much for

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:52.736

1:02:52.736 --> 1:02:54.071

1:02:54.071 --> 1:02:55.873
Let me know any future
episodes you guys would like me

1:02:55.906 --> 1:02:58.108

1:02:58.108 --> 1:02:59.910
Thanks again, guys for

and all your support and
I'll see you guys later.

1:03:01.711 --> 1:03:02.512
Bye.

1:03:03.447 --> 1:03:06.450
(suspenseful music)

1:03:22.266 --> 1:03:24.068
(anxious music)

1:03:24.068 --> 1:03:25.235
(flames crackling)

1:03:25.269 --> 1:03:27.872
(Tim groaning)

1:03:42.486 --> 1:03:43.954
- What's going on?

1:03:45.122 --> 1:03:45.923
- Run.

1:03:52.129 --> 1:03:54.798
(women coughing)

1:04:00.604 --> 1:04:02.772
- It'll be for your turn.

1:04:02.806 --> 1:04:04.508
- What is that thing?

1:04:06.643 --> 1:04:09.479
(mysterious music)

1:04:10.747 --> 1:04:13.317
(Ruby screaming)

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:14.118
- Misha?

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:18.322
- Karl, what was that thing?

1:04:18.322 --> 1:04:21.591
That creature, he tried to
attack us and it killed Tim.

1:04:21.691 --> 1:04:22.826
- Misha, where are you?

1:04:23.961 --> 1:04:25.529
- Oh, I'm with Ruby,
but we're driving to you

1:04:25.562 --> 1:04:26.763
and the car broke down.

1:04:26.796 --> 1:04:29.666
And we're at Mount Tread Woods.

1:04:29.733 --> 1:04:30.867
By the church.

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:33.470
- Okay, wait there, I'm coming.

1:04:34.371 --> 1:04:35.372
Fuck.

1:04:35.405 --> 1:04:36.806
He's right.

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:37.841
We've gotta go, now.

1:04:41.345 --> 1:04:44.048
(dramatic music)

1:04:49.486 --> 1:04:53.657
(ax thudding)
(Karl groaning)

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:56.360
(anxious music)

1:05:05.002 --> 1:05:06.636
- There's the thief.

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:08.572
- Oh, shit.

1:05:11.508 --> 1:05:13.410
- An actual leprechaun.

1:05:27.591 --> 1:05:29.393
I can't fucking believe it.

1:05:30.727 --> 1:05:32.896
- You told them to take me gold.

1:05:32.896 --> 1:05:34.064
(mystical music)

1:05:34.064 --> 1:05:36.600
- I wanted a piece
of your history.

1:05:43.073 --> 1:05:45.709
(anxious music)

1:05:49.246 --> 1:05:51.448
- Give me back what's mine.

1:05:55.252 --> 1:05:56.886
(magical music)

1:05:56.920 --> 1:05:59.689
Before you can
join your friends.

1:06:13.170 --> 1:06:15.305
Now, what am I doing here?

1:06:17.207 --> 1:06:19.843
(John groaning)

1:06:31.655 --> 1:06:33.257
- Hello?

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:34.124
Anyone?

1:06:35.325 --> 1:06:36.793
- Ruby, what is going on?

1:06:38.628 --> 1:06:41.031
- We messed up badly.

1:06:41.065 --> 1:06:42.232
I'm so sorry, Misha.

1:06:42.266 --> 1:06:43.267
- No, I need specifics.

1:06:43.333 --> 1:06:45.069
Tell me what is happening.

1:06:45.069 --> 1:06:47.271
- We stole from a leprechaun.

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:49.673
We stole the gold
from a leprechaun.

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:53.009
Now it's taking our
souls, one by one

1:06:53.043 --> 1:06:54.311
until he gets it back.

1:06:56.613 --> 1:06:59.083
- And what do we
do to stop this?

1:07:00.484 --> 1:07:01.485
- A four leaf clover.

1:07:02.919 --> 1:07:05.555
We find one and we're
gonna finish this with it.

1:07:07.124 --> 1:07:10.794
Until now, I guess the church
is the best place to hide out.

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:14.264
- Where we gonna
get one of those?

1:07:14.364 --> 1:07:15.732
- Wait in here.

1:07:15.732 --> 1:07:16.866
And we'll see.

1:07:21.105 --> 1:07:24.441
- Please, please Father, look
after me and my unborn child.

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:27.177
Please.

1:07:27.211 --> 1:07:30.214
(suspenseful music)

1:07:38.322 --> 1:07:39.723
- Ain't no god gonna help ya.

1:07:41.358 --> 1:07:44.161
(Misha screaming)

1:07:45.195 --> 1:07:48.398
(leprechaun chuckling)

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.522
- They grow in the
garden of faith.

1:08:19.696 --> 1:08:22.332
(anxious music)

1:08:43.587 --> 1:08:46.256
(Misha gasping)

1:08:52.296 --> 1:08:54.964
(mystical music)

1:08:58.268 --> 1:08:59.269
I found one.

1:09:01.905 --> 1:09:04.574
(anxious music)

1:09:06.109 --> 1:09:07.110
- No, no, no!

1:09:10.614 --> 1:09:11.415
No, no.

1:09:11.448 --> 1:09:12.749
No, please, no!

1:09:14.284 --> 1:09:15.084
Ruby!

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:18.388
- Misha.

1:09:19.689 --> 1:09:21.825
- Ruby, Ruby, please help.

1:09:23.126 --> 1:09:25.595
Please, I can't get this open.

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:30.800
- [Ruby] I'm trying.

1:09:39.476 --> 1:09:41.878
- (sobs) Go!

1:09:51.988 --> 1:09:54.258
- [Karl] We gotta find 'em.

1:09:59.162 --> 1:10:01.465
(Ruby panting)

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:03.833
- Ruby, we can't keep running.

1:10:06.002 --> 1:10:08.037
- We use this four
leaf clover to kill it.

1:10:09.373 --> 1:10:10.607
- It will bite our hands off.

1:10:10.607 --> 1:10:13.009
How exactly are
we gonna do that?

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:15.345
- We hold the fucker down
and force it down its--

1:10:15.445 --> 1:10:16.513
(dramatic music)
(ax thudding)

1:10:16.546 --> 1:10:18.014
(Ruby groaning)

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:20.684
(anxious music)

1:10:25.322 --> 1:10:26.122
Go!

1:10:26.155 --> 1:10:27.357
- [Misha] Ruby!

1:10:28.325 --> 1:10:29.125
Ruby.

1:10:29.158 --> 1:10:31.795
(foot thumping)

1:10:34.030 --> 1:10:35.365
- I'll be right behind you.

1:10:52.316 --> 1:10:54.718
(ax thumping)

1:11:04.828 --> 1:11:07.564
(mystical music)

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:14.504
- Another soul to keep.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:18.241
- [Marshall] Shit.

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:20.777
- Ready to pay back your sins?

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:22.245
And join the quad?

1:11:25.114 --> 1:11:26.115
- Marshall!

1:11:26.115 --> 1:11:27.884
- I can't see.

1:11:27.917 --> 1:11:29.753
(mystical music)

1:11:29.786 --> 1:11:32.556
(bones creaking)

1:11:54.811 --> 1:11:55.612
- Run, Misha!

1:11:55.645 --> 1:11:58.247
(hand thumping)

1:12:01.651 --> 1:12:04.388
- Oh, where d'you get that from?

1:12:04.388 --> 1:12:07.090
- You can have it, if you want.

1:12:07.123 --> 1:12:10.727
- Oh, you're not all
mean and bastards, then.

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:11.961
- [Karl] Misha!

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:16.800
(anxious music)

1:12:23.206 --> 1:12:26.376
(leprechaun coughing)

1:12:30.346 --> 1:12:31.815
- I put something special in.

1:12:31.848 --> 1:12:34.451
It's got four leaves
and it's green.

1:12:34.484 --> 1:12:36.953
(leprechaun coughing)

1:12:36.953 --> 1:12:39.989
(leprechaun gasping)

1:12:41.525 --> 1:12:43.159
- You did it.

1:12:43.159 --> 1:12:43.960
- It's over.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:50.033
(mystical music)

1:12:56.706 --> 1:12:58.374
- They're souls.

1:12:58.442 --> 1:12:59.242
They're set free.

1:13:15.892 --> 1:13:16.793
Any day now.

1:13:18.795 --> 1:13:19.596
- Any day.

1:13:22.932 --> 1:13:25.735
- You excited about
being in our new home?

1:13:25.769 --> 1:13:28.905
- (laughs) of course.

1:13:31.875 --> 1:13:32.709
- It was worth it.

1:13:33.843 --> 1:13:34.644
That gold.

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:37.280
- Yeah.

1:13:41.718 --> 1:13:43.352
(Karl yawning)

1:13:43.386 --> 1:13:46.790
- Sweetheart, I'm gonna go
have a sleep, all right?

1:13:46.890 --> 1:13:49.158
I'm gonna let you carry
on watching the film.

1:13:49.158 --> 1:13:51.561
- You don't wanna watch
the end of the movie?

1:13:51.595 --> 1:13:53.096
- I don't even understand it.

1:13:53.129 --> 1:13:56.766
It's a scarecrow, there's
some sort of 48 hour thing.

1:13:56.833 --> 1:13:57.834
I don't even...

1:14:00.203 --> 1:14:01.004
I'm gonna go.

1:14:01.004 --> 1:14:02.405
- All right.

1:14:02.405 --> 1:14:03.573
- See you upstairs, all right?

1:14:03.607 --> 1:14:04.407
- Okay.

1:14:24.961 --> 1:14:27.597
(water running)

1:14:35.238 --> 1:14:37.874
(anxious music)

1:14:40.243 --> 1:14:41.811
- Shucks, I'm back.

1:14:42.746 --> 1:14:45.448
(mystical music)

1:15:03.567 --> 1:15:06.169
(Misha gasping)

1:15:06.202 --> 1:15:09.205
(suspenseful music)

1:15:12.308 --> 1:15:15.011
(Misha groaning)

1:15:16.813 --> 1:15:17.614
- Karl!

1:15:24.588 --> 1:15:25.388
Karl!

1:15:33.763 --> 1:15:34.564
Karl!

1:15:35.965 --> 1:15:39.168
(stair chair whizzing)

1:15:54.217 --> 1:15:57.053
- Go on then, give
us a smile then.

1:15:59.322 --> 1:16:02.558
(Misha screaming)

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:05.161
(upbeat music)

1:17:25.241 --> 1:17:27.777
(bright music)

1:19:23.126 --> 1:19:25.761
(anxious music)
