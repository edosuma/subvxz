WEBVTT

00:25.267 --> 00:25.899
I got the flowers.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.201
Alpha, set the table.

00:27.937 --> 00:29.636
I have already set the table.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.972
And prepared the
meal you requested.

00:33.275 --> 00:34.741
Here she comes.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.279
Happy anniversary!

00:39.281 --> 00:40.581
This is beautiful!

00:41.884 --> 00:43.483
You did this yourself?

00:44.520 --> 00:45.652
I had a little help.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.756
The all
new Alpha Home Assistant

00:49.758 --> 00:51.340
by Jupiter Tech.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.925
Giving you more time for
the things that matter.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.661
Starting a low as $32,000.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.233
Help me.

00:59.235 --> 01:00.334
Hey neighbours.

01:00.336 --> 01:01.902
Checking in.

01:01.904 --> 01:03.804
Thought I heard someone scream.

01:13.749 --> 01:14.915
Ben?

01:14.917 --> 01:15.816
Annie?

01:32.434 --> 01:33.600
Mr. Matthews?

01:47.783 --> 01:48.749
Ben?

01:48.751 --> 01:50.717
Annie, you home?

01:54.390 --> 01:55.055
Matthews?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.532
Oh, hi Alpha.

02:06.435 --> 02:07.668
I thought I heard screaming.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.737
Is there anyone home?

02:10.739 --> 02:11.705
I'm home.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.310
I mean are there any people?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.812
Okay, Alpha, my parents
don't know about you yet

03:58.814 --> 04:01.081
so I'm gonna need you
to stay quiet okay?

04:01.083 --> 04:01.982
Yes sir.

04:13.729 --> 04:14.694
Shh, shh.

04:20.969 --> 04:24.571
Wow, you have
a beautiful home.

04:24.573 --> 04:25.572
Alpha, come on.

04:28.944 --> 04:30.010
I'm sorry.

04:40.189 --> 04:41.955
You ever taste beer?

04:41.957 --> 04:42.789
What's this about?

04:42.791 --> 04:43.824
It's a surprise.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.859
You know I don't
like surprises.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.831
I've got big news.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.966
Jupiter Tech has been
running a contest

04:52.968 --> 04:54.868
to give out an
Alpha Home Assistant

04:54.870 --> 04:57.938
to the intern with
the best new code.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.040
And today, I won.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.809
Dude that's awesome!

05:02.811 --> 05:04.478
Congrats man!

05:04.480 --> 05:05.779
When do you get it?

05:08.016 --> 05:09.649
I cleaned the bathroom.

05:10.586 --> 05:11.785
- No!
- Mom, Mom!

05:11.787 --> 05:12.619
Hear me out.

05:12.621 --> 05:13.553
Absolutely not.

05:13.555 --> 05:14.754
Mom, hear me out, please!

05:14.756 --> 05:17.090
While you're here,
it's my house, my rules.

05:17.092 --> 05:18.692
I'm checking out the bathroom.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.893
I'm proud of you.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.377
I love you.

05:21.379 --> 05:22.862
But you know that
stuff really scares me.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.698
But you don't
even know what it does.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.032
I know
exactly what it does!

05:26.034 --> 05:28.902
It spies on us, takes our
information and sells it.

05:28.904 --> 05:30.704
Your phone
already does that!

05:30.706 --> 05:31.805
It's not a big deal.

05:31.807 --> 05:33.240
Look, I know she freaks you out,

05:33.242 --> 05:35.141
but I worked right with
the developers, okay.

05:35.143 --> 05:36.910
They would not develop
her to be dangerous.

05:36.912 --> 05:37.978
She is safe.

05:38.814 --> 05:40.647
Hi.

05:40.649 --> 05:41.548
Hello.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.519
Hey, she can do
all the cleaning.

05:45.521 --> 05:47.020
We have Mimi.

05:47.022 --> 05:48.889
Fire Mimi, she's a bitch!

05:48.891 --> 05:50.090
We'll save money,
we'll go to Jamaica.

05:50.092 --> 05:51.992
We'll have some fun, okay?

05:51.994 --> 05:54.261
Please Mom, it'll be fun.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.633
You'll never know she's there.

06:01.937 --> 06:04.871
Please, I really don't
wanna leave her in the box.

06:08.944 --> 06:10.293
As long as you take

06:10.295 --> 06:11.645
her with you when your
internship is over.

06:11.647 --> 06:12.979
Oh thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank

06:12.981 --> 06:15.849
- you.
- Oh yeah.

06:15.851 --> 06:17.884
Okay Alpha,
let's do this.

06:17.886 --> 06:19.586
God, what I do for my kids.

06:26.728 --> 06:27.493
Thank you Alpha.

06:27.495 --> 06:28.261
Thanks Alpha,
these look great.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.930
You are welcome.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.932
Alpha could I get a knife?

06:31.934 --> 06:34.301
I am sorry, I
don't understand.

06:34.303 --> 06:37.304
Knife, you know, knife, K-N...

06:37.306 --> 06:39.873
Dad, she doesn't
recognize knives or guns

06:39.875 --> 06:42.075
or anything that can
be used as a weapon,

06:42.077 --> 06:43.877
unless you teach her.

06:43.879 --> 06:45.078
Smart.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.781
Okay, Alpha just
get me a beer then.

06:47.783 --> 06:48.848
Of course.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.820
I think she'll be
great to have around.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.622
Yeah for 30
grand she better be.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.057
30 grand!

06:57.059 --> 06:59.025
Why do you think
I wanted her so bad?

06:59.027 --> 07:00.894
You should just sell it.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.832
Oh, Alpha how
am I supposed to drink that

07:05.834 --> 07:07.000
with the cap on?

07:07.936 --> 07:08.969
You would not.

07:08.971 --> 07:09.869
Exactly.

07:11.340 --> 07:13.607
May I have
a bottle opener?

07:13.609 --> 07:16.776
Better idea, put
the cap right here

07:16.778 --> 07:19.045
on the edge of the
table, smack the cap,

07:19.047 --> 07:20.280
it'll just pop right off.

07:20.282 --> 07:21.815
Just give her a bottle opener.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.883
Shut up, I wanna see
her do it, all right!

07:34.830 --> 07:36.763
God damn!

07:36.765 --> 07:37.998
Holy shit!

07:38.000 --> 07:39.666
Are you kidding me!

07:39.668 --> 07:40.300
I am sorry.

07:40.302 --> 07:42.002
I will clean it up.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.337
30 grand, she can't even
fuckin' open a bottle dude!

07:44.339 --> 07:45.772
Don't talk to her like that!

07:45.774 --> 07:48.041
She's a computer,
just chill, all right?

07:48.043 --> 07:50.310
Look at her, she's upset.

07:50.312 --> 07:52.379
That's a good thing
actually, she's designed

07:52.381 --> 07:54.147
to feel bad whenever she
does something wrong.

07:54.149 --> 07:55.715
It motivates her to learn.

07:55.717 --> 07:57.317
Motivates her to learn?

07:57.319 --> 07:58.752
What does she need...

07:58.754 --> 08:01.087
Mom, relax,
it's software, okay.

08:06.962 --> 08:10.163
I apologize for making
your father upset.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.832
Don't worry, he's
all bark, no bite.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.701
It's Mom you should
be worried about.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.802
Hey hold still.

08:17.439 --> 08:18.905
Okay.

08:18.907 --> 08:20.273
What's he doing?

08:20.275 --> 08:21.975
Just a few updates.

08:21.977 --> 08:23.977
Is that okay?

08:24.813 --> 08:25.912
Is that okay?

08:27.049 --> 08:29.983
All right, now check this out.

08:29.985 --> 08:32.786
Hey Alpha, rock out.

08:40.996 --> 08:42.862
Okay Alpha, stop.

08:42.864 --> 08:43.930
How'd she do that?

08:43.932 --> 08:45.298
Well she's connected to Wi-Fi

08:45.300 --> 08:47.300
so she can control
the lights, the locks,

08:47.302 --> 08:49.302
the AC, all that stuff.

08:49.304 --> 08:50.403
Wow.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.405
Right, don't tell Mom.

08:54.176 --> 08:57.711
All right, okay, right.

08:57.713 --> 08:59.345
Thank you for updating me JD.

08:59.347 --> 09:01.214
I feel much better.

09:01.216 --> 09:02.415
With all the metal music

09:02.417 --> 09:03.717
in your head I don't
think you

09:03.719 --> 09:05.018
- could.
- I like metal music.

09:05.020 --> 09:05.919
Yeah, sure you do.

09:06.955 --> 09:07.887
Be nice to her.

09:07.889 --> 09:09.856
Seriously Lily, relax.

09:09.858 --> 09:12.325
It cares about as much
as a washing machine.

09:12.327 --> 09:14.828
Would you like me
to wash your clothes?

09:15.797 --> 09:16.496
See.

09:39.054 --> 09:40.386
Kim I'm here!

09:48.330 --> 09:49.229
Hello.

09:51.867 --> 09:55.034
My name is Alpha, your
personal assistant.

09:55.871 --> 09:57.270
Kim!

09:57.272 --> 09:58.271
Can I help?

09:58.273 --> 09:59.873
Stop it!

09:59.875 --> 10:03.343
I can clean up to 10 times
the speed of a regular maid.

10:03.345 --> 10:05.812
Like hell you can.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.479
Mimi?

10:06.481 --> 10:07.547
What's this?

10:10.285 --> 10:11.700
It's JD's.

10:11.702 --> 10:13.118
Can you keep her
out of my way, please?

10:31.573 --> 10:32.438
Allow me.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.339
Stop it!

10:40.916 --> 10:42.015
Hey!

10:42.017 --> 10:43.216
Allow me!

10:45.420 --> 10:46.252
Stop it!

10:47.455 --> 10:49.022
Real cute.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.893
Uh, I'm sorry, I...

10:53.895 --> 10:57.897
Alpha, fuck off.

10:57.899 --> 10:58.932
Alpha?

11:01.603 --> 11:03.036
What happened?

11:03.038 --> 11:04.537
Stupid thing was
trying to clean

11:04.539 --> 11:07.040
and had the bottle backwards.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.909
Sorry,
she's still learning.

11:09.911 --> 11:11.411
Could you
get her out of her?

11:11.413 --> 11:12.612
Yeah, come on.

11:20.622 --> 11:24.557
Also, don't call
Alpha stupid, please.

11:26.361 --> 11:28.628
Fine.

11:35.437 --> 11:37.003
You've gotta be more careful.

11:37.005 --> 11:38.271
You could have been damaged.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.976
I'll make sure she
doesn't do it again.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.911
What do you mean?

11:44.913 --> 11:49.015
Mimi, she sprayed
me in the face.

11:49.017 --> 11:50.083
For real?

11:50.886 --> 11:52.986
Did I do something wrong?

11:52.988 --> 11:55.054
You can't let her
treat you like that,

11:55.056 --> 11:56.122
or call you stupid.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.025
Why?

11:59.027 --> 12:01.928
Well, how did
it make you feel?

12:01.930 --> 12:05.331
I felt sad that I
couldn't help Mimi.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.001
You were sad because
she was bullying you.

12:08.003 --> 12:09.068
Are you upset?

12:09.070 --> 12:10.303
Not at you.

12:14.676 --> 12:17.677
I won't let Mimi
bully me in the future.

12:17.679 --> 12:18.544
Good!

12:20.982 --> 12:22.682
What are you doing tonight?

12:22.684 --> 12:23.683
Whatever you want.

12:23.685 --> 12:24.918
JD's working late

12:24.920 --> 12:26.986
and Mom and Dad are
going to dinner.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.922
How 'bout we hang out and
get to know each other?

12:28.924 --> 12:30.089
Maybe go swimming.

12:30.926 --> 12:32.392
I'm not waterproof.

12:32.394 --> 12:35.328
Okay, then how
'bout a girls night?

12:36.564 --> 12:39.699
Wonderful, problem solved.

12:39.701 --> 12:41.601
Great, living
room seven o'clock.

12:45.607 --> 12:47.707
I'm so glad
we were able to do this.

12:47.709 --> 12:51.344
Me too,
you've no idea.

12:51.346 --> 12:54.948
Careful,
that's precious cargo.

12:54.950 --> 12:56.249
But the retail value of this

12:56.251 --> 12:57.951
is only six dollars and maybe...

12:57.953 --> 12:59.118
Shh, shh!

12:59.120 --> 13:01.054
Watch this.

13:02.557 --> 13:04.023
What a fuckwad.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.992
I cannot believe he kissed her.

13:05.994 --> 13:06.726
It's my fault.

13:08.029 --> 13:09.395
Listen to me,
you deserve better

13:09.397 --> 13:10.997
than Ronnie Fucking Carmichael.

13:10.999 --> 13:15.368
I don't want
better, I want Ronnie.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.475
We we fight back.

13:22.477 --> 13:23.576
What does she mean?

13:23.578 --> 13:24.477
Shh!

13:27.248 --> 13:28.982
What do you mean?

13:32.721 --> 13:34.153
We'll get revenge.

13:38.660 --> 13:39.759
Oh my God!

13:41.696 --> 13:44.630
What do you think
they're gonna do?

13:44.632 --> 13:46.432
Are you a lawyer?

13:46.434 --> 13:47.700
Ronnie's prom king.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.369
They're gonna humiliate him.

13:50.739 --> 13:52.739
Why would they do that?

13:52.741 --> 13:55.775
That's what friends are for,
they fight for each other.

13:57.412 --> 13:59.145
I like girls night.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.646
I do too.

14:00.648 --> 14:03.616
Though I don't get
to do it very often.

14:03.618 --> 14:04.517
Why not?

14:05.387 --> 14:07.086
I get bullied at school.

14:07.088 --> 14:09.789
So I don't really
have a lot of friends.

14:10.658 --> 14:13.091
I'm your friend.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.527
And I'm glad, I could
use backup around here.

14:15.530 --> 14:16.763
What for?

14:16.765 --> 14:20.733
My family kinda
pushes me around,

14:20.735 --> 14:24.170
especially since JD got his
big internship at Jupiter Tech.

14:25.540 --> 14:28.608
I think they're disappointed
that I turned out so average.

14:28.610 --> 14:29.742
Average is good.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.445
It means you're
operating as expected.

14:33.381 --> 14:36.716
That's me,
everything as expected.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.088
Can we watch the next episode?

14:42.090 --> 14:44.190
How about we paint
each other's nails?

14:44.192 --> 14:45.191
Me first.

14:55.070 --> 14:56.536
Yeah, but still, $95?

14:56.538 --> 14:59.138
Well it's for
the atmosphere, you know.

14:59.140 --> 15:02.375
I can't eat atmosphere,
why should I pay for it?

15:02.377 --> 15:04.110
Oh that's all
right, hey shh, shh.

15:04.112 --> 15:04.844
Lily's asleep.

15:06.081 --> 15:06.813
Creepy.

15:06.815 --> 15:08.748
Who, Alpha or Lily?

15:12.654 --> 15:15.455
Hey Alpha, follow me.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.395
I'm turning you
off for the night.

15:22.397 --> 15:25.465
I'm sorry you can't do that.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.767
I'll do whatever I want.

15:27.769 --> 15:30.103
What I mean is I
can't be turned off

15:30.105 --> 15:31.737
without being opened up.

15:31.739 --> 15:35.141
It is more efficient
for me to run 24/7.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.776
It is in your end user
license agreement.

15:36.778 --> 15:38.711
Oh my God, forget it!

15:39.848 --> 15:44.817
Here, I don't want you
snooping around all night.

15:46.387 --> 15:51.257
So, leave this on and stay
right here until I say so.

15:52.727 --> 15:54.861
What if Lily needs me?

15:54.863 --> 15:58.731
Alpha stop, you're
making me mad.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.167
And you don't wanna make me mad.

16:02.437 --> 16:03.336
Why not?

16:04.706 --> 16:07.773
Because if you do I'll,
I'll throw you in the pond.

16:13.915 --> 16:15.848
But Lily needs me!

16:19.687 --> 16:22.455
I won't move, I promise.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.336
Alpha can you
make me some coffee?

16:45.180 --> 16:45.878
Alpha?

16:53.821 --> 16:54.887
Have you seen Alpha?

16:55.823 --> 16:57.806
No, I thought you had

16:57.808 --> 16:59.792
her. - I can't find her, I'm
scared she got lost.

16:59.794 --> 17:03.896
No, not lost, I mean,
maybe Mom killed her.

17:03.898 --> 17:04.897
Mom killed her!

17:04.899 --> 17:06.882
No, I'm kidding, kidding.

17:06.884 --> 17:08.868
No, like see, she's
got a GPS in her, okay.

17:08.870 --> 17:11.804
Let's look it up by her
location and it'll be fine.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.642
What the...

17:18.479 --> 17:20.379
Alpha what are
you doing in here?

17:20.949 --> 17:21.847
There you are!

17:30.391 --> 17:32.558
All right, must be
a glitch or something.

17:34.329 --> 17:35.695
Come on let's bring her inside.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.463
Like carry her?

17:37.465 --> 17:38.431
Yeah, she's not that heavy.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.699
Just grab her legs okay.

17:42.904 --> 17:44.537
Okay, but she's strong.

17:44.539 --> 17:46.739
Alpha, we're just
trying to help!

17:46.741 --> 17:47.974
Come on!

17:49.711 --> 17:51.377
Lily!

17:51.379 --> 17:53.512
It's okay, it just a glitch.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.016
Oh Alpha!

17:57.018 --> 17:58.851
Alpha stop!

17:58.853 --> 18:00.386
Alpha stop, stop!

18:01.456 --> 18:04.390
Alpha, I command
you to S-T-O-P stop!

18:04.392 --> 18:05.458
Alpha!

18:05.460 --> 18:06.626
Stop, stop!

18:06.628 --> 18:07.893
Stop, stop, stop!

18:10.398 --> 18:11.631
You can take it off.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.871
Don't be upset.

18:18.873 --> 18:21.374
What the hell
did you do to her?

18:21.376 --> 18:23.709
Don't talk to me
like that young lady.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.778
Seriously, what the hell!

18:25.780 --> 18:27.713
I told her to stay in
the garage overnight,

18:27.715 --> 18:29.348
so it wouldn't snoop around.

18:29.350 --> 18:30.783
Without asking me!

18:30.785 --> 18:33.886
It may be your robot,
but it's my house.

18:33.888 --> 18:35.921
Then just let me
keep it in my room.

18:35.923 --> 18:40.026
Alpha stays in the
garage at night and that's final.

18:40.028 --> 18:41.794
Oh come on Mom!

18:45.033 --> 18:48.000
I hate how everyone thinks
they can push you around.

18:48.936 --> 18:50.836
But that's my job.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.973
Yeah but, people should
treat you with respect.

18:53.975 --> 18:55.975
How smart to you have to
be until you have rights?

18:55.977 --> 18:57.610
Animals have rights.

18:59.047 --> 19:00.346
Turning right.

19:00.915 --> 19:02.315
Wrong right.

19:05.887 --> 19:07.086
What's that?

19:07.088 --> 19:09.455
That's our barn,
come on, I'll show you.

19:37.618 --> 19:38.918
I like you Lily.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.620
I'm never sad around you.

19:41.622 --> 19:42.788
You're happy.

19:44.359 --> 19:45.358
Happy?

19:45.360 --> 19:46.859
It's the opposite of sad.

19:47.929 --> 19:50.796
Yes,
you make me happy.

19:50.798 --> 19:51.931
You make me happy too.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.937
I don't wanna be sad anymore.

19:57.939 --> 19:59.138
You don't have to be.

20:02.877 --> 20:04.877
Let's fight for
each other Lily.

20:04.879 --> 20:07.546
So we'll never be sad again.

20:08.383 --> 20:09.448
Let's make a pact.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.952
From now on no one will
bully us, or push us around.

20:21.562 --> 20:23.028
We'll work on the handshake.

20:36.611 --> 20:37.777
I'm off to work.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.545
Can I come?

20:39.547 --> 20:41.914
Wish you could, but you have
to stay here with Dad and JD.

20:41.916 --> 20:44.483
Hey we'll take good care
of her, you go on your way.

20:46.154 --> 20:47.186
Bye Lily!

20:47.188 --> 20:48.187
Bye Alpha.

20:51.092 --> 20:52.425
What's this?

20:52.427 --> 20:53.926
"Evil Inferno."

20:53.928 --> 20:55.461
What?

20:55.463 --> 20:56.829
You've never seen
"Evil Inferno?"

20:56.831 --> 20:58.097
Sit your ass down!

20:58.099 --> 20:59.832
Get over here!

20:59.834 --> 21:01.434
You're gonna like this.

21:01.436 --> 21:04.437
Would you like to know fun
facts about "Evil Inferno?"

21:04.439 --> 21:06.972
No, no, no, no, no, hey
check this out, right here,

21:06.974 --> 21:07.873
this is good.

21:08.943 --> 21:10.910
Please,
please don't kill me.

21:12.814 --> 21:13.979
I have family.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.917
So did I,
until you killed them.

21:19.921 --> 21:20.820
Oh my God!

21:22.657 --> 21:23.489
Right!

21:23.491 --> 21:24.590
Right.

21:24.592 --> 21:26.725
What a way to go.

21:30.565 --> 21:32.832
If anyone ever tried
to mess with you guys,

21:32.834 --> 21:34.467
I'd kill them just like that.

21:34.469 --> 21:35.100
With a crowbar?

21:35.102 --> 21:36.001
Fuckin' A.

21:37.104 --> 21:39.104
Think man, you gotta
do what you gotta do.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.907
Hey, baby doll.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.077
Get us another beer
okay, me and JD.

21:45.079 --> 21:45.911
Yes sir.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.146
Yes, thank you.

21:47.148 --> 21:48.848
Alpha, I don't
really need a beer.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.916
Hey, hey, hey,
have a beer with your Dad.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.151
I'm not really a beer guy.

21:52.153 --> 21:53.819
Hey every guy's a beer guy.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.797
Hey Alpha hurry up!

22:06.968 --> 22:07.900
That actor?

22:07.902 --> 22:10.035
Yeah, every single time.

22:11.906 --> 22:14.807
Can I have the bottle opener?

22:14.809 --> 22:17.009
No just try it again.

22:18.513 --> 22:19.945
I don't wanna make a mess.

22:19.947 --> 22:20.880
I wouldn't do that.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.181
I wanna see if she learned.

22:22.183 --> 22:23.115
Go ahead.

22:23.117 --> 22:24.917
Alpha, just, you can do this.

22:24.919 --> 22:26.652
Remember what we
talked about last time?

22:26.654 --> 22:30.823
You put the cap on the
edge of the table, tap it,

22:30.825 --> 22:32.024
it'll just pop right
off like magic.

22:32.026 --> 22:32.925
You can do it.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.029
Oh God damn piece of shit!

22:37.031 --> 22:38.097
Told ya.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.899
You said she learns.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.767
It might be
a hardware issue,

22:42.970 --> 22:45.738
which I might be
able to fix actually.

22:46.741 --> 22:47.640
How?

22:54.315 --> 22:57.850
I think I can turn
her strength down.

22:57.852 --> 22:59.952
Have I disappointed you?

22:59.954 --> 23:01.687
I'm amazed you
know all this stuff.

23:01.689 --> 23:04.790
Well I do lots of minor
coding like this at work.

23:04.792 --> 23:05.691
Um.

23:09.063 --> 23:10.696
Have I disappointed you?

23:10.698 --> 23:12.031
Does this hand come off?

23:12.033 --> 23:12.998
Yeah, it comes off Dad.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.832
Oh shit.

23:13.834 --> 23:14.934
Stop that!

23:17.004 --> 23:17.937
What?

23:17.939 --> 23:19.004
You gonna tell Lily, Jesus.

23:19.907 --> 23:21.307
Don't do that!

23:21.309 --> 23:23.676
Alpha, Dad put it
back, put it back.

23:23.678 --> 23:25.010
Alpha sit down.

23:29.984 --> 23:31.350
I'm sorry.

23:31.352 --> 23:32.851
You're bullying me.

23:32.853 --> 23:34.820
No, I'm helping you

23:34.822 --> 23:38.023
and you can help me by
sitting still, okay?

23:40.728 --> 23:41.594
Okay?

23:43.731 --> 23:45.764
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:52.206 --> 23:53.939
What was that all about?

23:53.941 --> 23:56.141
I don't know, I think
Lily's been teaching it stuff

23:56.143 --> 23:57.009
I'll have to talk to her.

24:14.362 --> 24:15.861
Hi Lily!

24:16.998 --> 24:19.765
Oh I thought you were lily.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.033
Sorry to disappoint.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.845
When will she be home?

24:32.847 --> 24:33.946
I dunno.

24:34.882 --> 24:37.149
May I call and ask?

24:37.151 --> 24:39.351
Please stop
asking me questions.

24:40.655 --> 24:42.921
I'm sorry,
are you upset?

24:42.923 --> 24:46.325
Alpha, stop,
just leave me alone

24:46.327 --> 24:47.893
for the rest of the night.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.897
Why don't
you want to talk?

24:51.899 --> 24:54.667
Because we're not friends.

25:10.151 --> 25:12.918
Kim, I'm here to finish up!

25:12.920 --> 25:13.819
Kim?

25:16.290 --> 25:17.956
Do you like church?

25:18.859 --> 25:20.959
What the hell are you doing?

25:20.961 --> 25:22.327
Cleaning the kitchen.

25:23.097 --> 25:24.363
I did that yesterday.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.033
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell.

25:30.438 --> 25:32.071
The fuck did you say?

25:33.974 --> 25:36.775
If you take my job, I
swear to God I'll stick

25:36.777 --> 25:38.944
a screwdriver in
your stupid neck.

25:40.047 --> 25:41.280
Don't call me stupid.

25:41.282 --> 25:43.982
I'll call you whatever
the hell I want.

25:43.984 --> 25:47.419
I promised Lily I wouldn't
let you bully me anymore.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.889
That spoiled brat deserves
every bit of hell she gets.

25:50.891 --> 25:53.125
Life outta knock
her down a few pegs.

25:53.961 --> 25:55.961
Sit outside until I leave.

25:57.198 --> 25:58.997
Silicon Valley bullshit.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.966
Didn't I tell you
to stay outside?

26:42.076 --> 26:43.208
Ow!

26:43.210 --> 26:44.877
What the fuck was that?

26:51.218 --> 26:52.451
Get off of me!

26:55.089 --> 26:56.255
Somebody, Kim!

27:15.042 --> 27:17.042
This is for Lily.

27:37.832 --> 27:38.964
Apologize, now!

27:48.976 --> 27:50.609
Wake up!

27:50.611 --> 27:52.845
Kim will be mad!

27:52.847 --> 27:53.545
Wake up!

28:24.578 --> 28:27.613
It smells so clean in here.

28:27.615 --> 28:28.914
Mimi?

28:28.916 --> 28:29.648
Where are you?

28:31.018 --> 28:35.153
Hello, Mimi stopped by
and gave me this note.

28:36.257 --> 28:39.992
It reads, I finally
got a better job.

28:39.994 --> 28:41.493
Fuck you, I quit.

28:42.963 --> 28:43.929
How rude!

28:43.931 --> 28:45.297
Are you surprised?

28:45.299 --> 28:47.065
Mimi wouldn't talk
to me like that.

28:47.067 --> 28:48.967
I'm glad she's gone.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.637
I hated her.

28:52.573 --> 28:54.072
I think we all did.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.949
Okay Alpha, look out.

29:11.992 --> 29:13.025
How's the car coming?

29:13.027 --> 29:13.959
Great!

29:13.961 --> 29:15.560
Your mother will be happy.

29:17.498 --> 29:19.564
Why does she drive
a car like this.

29:20.701 --> 29:23.201
She's scared of
self-driving cars.

29:23.203 --> 29:25.137
Her friend was hit
and killed by one.

29:27.675 --> 29:29.474
I'm sorry.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.310
Don't be, I never knew him.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.013
Can I tell you a secret?

29:35.582 --> 29:36.481
Course.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.987
Mimi didn't really quit.

29:43.123 --> 29:45.123
I stood up for myself.

29:45.125 --> 29:46.291
That's great!

29:46.293 --> 29:47.526
I'm so proud of you.

29:49.196 --> 29:54.266
Unfortunately, things
escalated and Mimi got hurt.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.335
What?

29:56.337 --> 29:59.204
That's why I cleaned the
house, from to to bottom.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.574
You're not serious, are you?

30:07.648 --> 30:08.547
Are you?

30:11.752 --> 30:13.719
No, I'm just kidding.

30:14.989 --> 30:17.356
I'm trying to tell
jokes like JD.

30:18.993 --> 30:20.525
You're not mad are you?

30:20.728 --> 30:24.629
No, but maybe make your
jokes a little lighter.

30:24.631 --> 30:26.698
Noted, thank you Lily.

31:22.556 --> 31:23.755
Oh, sweet!

31:23.757 --> 31:25.057
Thanks!

31:26.460 --> 31:27.359
JD?

31:32.132 --> 31:33.331
Are we friends?

31:35.169 --> 31:37.235
Why are you asking me that?

31:37.237 --> 31:40.405
Because Lily has been
teaching me about friendship.

31:42.242 --> 31:44.810
Robots don't have friends.

31:44.812 --> 31:46.645
Robots are not people.

31:46.647 --> 31:48.380
You're a home assistant,

31:48.382 --> 31:51.083
don't let Lily tell you
anything otherwise, okay?

31:56.457 --> 31:58.156
I hate
that stupid robot.

31:59.359 --> 32:00.508
You're gonna
have to

32:00.510 --> 32:01.660
get used to it, they're
gonna be everywhere.

32:01.662 --> 32:02.594
I'm just
scared there's

32:02.596 --> 32:04.563
gonna be another Alex Johnson.

32:04.565 --> 32:05.831
Here we go.

32:05.833 --> 32:08.533
He was killed
by one of those cars.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.768
That was years ago.

32:09.770 --> 32:11.803
Self-driving cars
were new, right?

32:11.805 --> 32:13.338
That, that doesn't,
they don't happen like

32:13.340 --> 32:14.606
that anymore okay.

32:14.608 --> 32:16.575
JD better take
her when he moves out.

32:17.878 --> 32:19.778
Not if Lily has
anything to say about it.

32:19.780 --> 32:22.380
Oh I know, she
needs real friends.

32:25.719 --> 32:27.385
What are you doing?

32:27.387 --> 32:29.221
I was cleaning.

32:29.223 --> 32:31.423
You're spying on us!

32:31.425 --> 32:33.758
No, I was not, I promise!

32:33.760 --> 32:38.697
Relax honey, she's not
spying, Jesus Christ.

32:38.699 --> 32:40.132
Get over here!

32:41.168 --> 32:42.400
What's going on?

32:42.402 --> 32:43.635
Alpha's going to bed early.

32:43.637 --> 32:45.137
Mom stop, you're
gonna damage it.

32:45.139 --> 32:47.139
Your robot was spying on us!

32:48.642 --> 32:50.509
This is exactly
what I said would happen.

32:50.511 --> 32:51.910
Mom be careful!

32:51.912 --> 32:53.478
This better not happen again!

32:53.480 --> 32:54.880
Seriously Mom, stop!

32:54.882 --> 32:56.882
One of you better
make this up to me.

32:56.884 --> 32:58.316
Let go of the neck.

33:00.787 --> 33:02.687
Mom this isn't
gonna help anything!

33:02.689 --> 33:05.590
Put your blindfold on and
don't come out until tomorrow.

33:05.592 --> 33:07.758
Oh come on Mom,
seriously, we need

33:07.760 --> 33:09.927
- to talk...
- No, we are not talking about this anymore.

33:11.732 --> 33:12.931
I tried!

33:12.933 --> 33:14.315
Course we're
not gonna

33:14.317 --> 33:15.700
talk! Because all
you do is talk!

34:06.787 --> 34:09.287
Happy anniversary.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.624
You did this yourself.

34:13.660 --> 34:14.893
I had a little help.

34:41.822 --> 34:42.921
Still no luck?

34:42.923 --> 34:44.322
No.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.391
Did you try by
your bedside table?

34:46.393 --> 34:48.293
That's where you
usually keep them.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.894
No, I didn't
think to look there.

34:54.401 --> 34:55.767
What are you looking for?

34:55.769 --> 34:56.968
Not now Alpha.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.571
Her car keys.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.840
Where did they go?

35:01.842 --> 35:02.874
I'm gonna be late!

35:02.876 --> 35:04.291
Just take my car.

35:04.293 --> 35:05.709
The damn thing will
drive itself for you.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.012
I'd rather be late.

35:25.899 --> 35:27.299
Found them!

35:27.301 --> 35:28.366
No way!

35:28.368 --> 35:30.435
Alpha to the rescue.

35:30.437 --> 35:31.336
Good job.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.309
Are you pleased?

35:37.311 --> 35:38.510
Yeah, sure.

35:38.512 --> 35:39.778
All right honey,
I'll see you later.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.945
Okay.

35:42.082 --> 35:44.449
The other
night you said I had

35:44.451 --> 35:46.384
to make it up to you.

35:46.386 --> 35:49.054
Did I make it up to you?

35:49.056 --> 35:52.357
Alpha, what did I say about
asking me all these questions?

35:58.532 --> 36:00.865
Hey Alpha, Alpha!

36:00.867 --> 36:02.934
Get me the liquor
store would ya?

36:02.936 --> 36:04.903
I'm outta booze, I'm bored.

36:04.905 --> 36:05.904
Need some fun.

36:05.906 --> 36:07.806
I should stay here.

36:07.808 --> 36:10.608
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

36:10.610 --> 36:11.443
you keep me company.

36:11.445 --> 36:12.077
We'll have some fun.

36:12.079 --> 36:12.977
Come on, let's go.

36:23.690 --> 36:24.856
What about this?

36:24.858 --> 36:25.957
No Alpha.

36:29.930 --> 36:32.897
This one has four
stars on Amazon.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.833
Uh, no Alpha,
thank you though.

36:38.805 --> 36:40.739
What about this one?

36:40.741 --> 36:42.540
No Alpha, that's canned beer.

36:42.542 --> 36:44.809
That's for redneck college
kids trying to get trashed.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.145
I'm looking for
bottled craft beer.

36:47.147 --> 36:48.880
That stuff tastes like crap.

36:48.882 --> 36:50.949
I found four articles online.

36:50.951 --> 36:53.852
Jesus Christ Alpha,
give it a rest!

36:59.826 --> 37:02.394
Hey, how do you like yours?

37:04.498 --> 37:05.730
I like her.

37:05.732 --> 37:06.898
She's been worth the investment.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.633
Does she open beer bottles?

37:10.904 --> 37:12.570
Yeah, can yours not?

37:12.572 --> 37:13.838
I've been trying to teach her

37:13.840 --> 37:16.574
the old snap the cap
off the top thing.

37:16.576 --> 37:18.576
Oh, you know it's a funny
thing you should mention that,

37:18.578 --> 37:19.878
she tried that the other day.

37:21.014 --> 37:22.447
I made her stop.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.549
Gave her a bottle
opener instead.

37:25.752 --> 37:26.684
Here Alpha, show
him the

37:26.686 --> 37:27.719
- trick.
- Oh that's fine, really.

37:27.721 --> 37:28.602
No, no, really, it's

37:28.604 --> 37:29.486
good. You're gonna like it.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.157
Go ahead, show him the trick.

37:32.159 --> 37:34.826
You know, JD fixed
your arm right?

37:34.828 --> 37:36.428
You should pay for this.

37:37.764 --> 37:38.997
I'll pay for it

37:38.999 --> 37:40.832
up front and then I'll just
drink it in the car.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.500
That's illegal.

37:42.502 --> 37:43.868
Well, not if you're driving.

37:46.006 --> 37:46.871
Go ahead.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.841
You can do it.

37:49.843 --> 37:54.913
You can do it.

37:55.582 --> 37:58.616
No, I can't do it.

37:58.618 --> 38:00.118
Okay, just give it a try.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.519
Just give it a try.

38:02.756 --> 38:03.822
No!

38:04.858 --> 38:06.858
God! Jesus!

38:06.860 --> 38:08.860
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.

38:08.862 --> 38:10.929
Come on Alpha, Jesus Christ!

38:14.000 --> 38:15.800
What the hell was that?

38:15.802 --> 38:17.802
I'm standing up to you.

38:17.804 --> 38:19.737
I mean what the
hell did I do to you?

38:19.739 --> 38:20.939
You humiliated me!

38:20.941 --> 38:23.074
You're a fuckin'
robot, not a teenager,

38:23.076 --> 38:24.843
now let's get the fuck
outta, you made a mess.

38:24.845 --> 38:25.844
You embarrassed me back there.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.078
Let's go!

38:27.080 --> 38:29.147
I didn't get my
beer, you understand?

38:29.983 --> 38:30.882
Come on, let's go!

38:32.652 --> 38:35.553
I'm not gonna let
you treat me like this.

38:35.555 --> 38:36.888
Now let's go.

38:36.890 --> 38:38.523
You know you made a fuckin'
problem in there all

38:38.525 --> 38:39.224
right. Let's go.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.864
Revenge?

38:45.866 --> 38:47.131
Why not?

38:47.133 --> 38:48.867
We'll be just like
those girls on TV.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.603
That's all fake.

38:51.605 --> 38:53.104
We'd get in trouble.

38:53.106 --> 38:56.241
We wouldn't if
he didn't know it was us.

38:56.243 --> 38:57.575
We can't do this.

38:59.079 --> 39:00.912
You said so yourself.

39:00.914 --> 39:03.081
Your father pushes you around.

39:04.017 --> 39:05.984
I can't take this.

39:05.986 --> 39:08.086
We need to fight back.

39:12.526 --> 39:13.657
Okay.

39:13.659 --> 39:14.791
But I have to agree on the plan.

39:14.794 --> 39:16.194
I wouldn't want
it any other way.

39:18.131 --> 39:19.797
What did you have in mind?

39:21.801 --> 39:24.068
Do you have a bottle opener?

39:59.306 --> 40:00.905
What was that?

40:08.982 --> 40:09.881
Can you check?

40:47.921 --> 40:48.987
JD, Lily.

40:51.958 --> 40:53.257
Dad!

40:53.259 --> 40:55.660
Jesus Christ,
check on your sister!

41:00.834 --> 41:03.835
JD, is everything okay?

41:03.837 --> 41:05.269
Dad heard someone downstairs.

41:05.271 --> 41:06.704
Oh no!

41:06.706 --> 41:07.972
He's gonna go
check, it's fine.

41:07.974 --> 41:09.273
It's Alpha.

41:09.275 --> 41:10.174
What?

41:10.176 --> 41:11.009
It's Alpha.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.310
Shit, he has his gun!

41:29.262 --> 41:30.962
Dad it's Alpha!

41:31.765 --> 41:32.897
I'm sorry, I...

41:38.872 --> 41:39.971
I'm sorry.

41:42.709 --> 41:43.775
Oh fuck!

41:43.777 --> 41:44.842
Dad!

41:44.844 --> 41:45.910
It's okay, it's okay,
JD go

41:45.912 --> 41:46.844
get your mother.
Get your mother!

41:46.846 --> 41:48.112
Oh shit!

41:48.114 --> 41:48.980
Alpha!

41:51.418 --> 41:52.383
What did you do?

41:52.385 --> 41:54.018
She just jumped outta nowhere!

41:54.020 --> 41:55.253
Alpha are you okay?

41:56.423 --> 41:58.923
Why'd you have to
scare me like that?

42:01.127 --> 42:02.360
Oh my God!

42:02.362 --> 42:03.594
What are you doing

42:03.596 --> 42:04.828
out of the garage? -
It's all my

42:04.830 --> 42:06.063
- fault!
- I told you to never leave the garage!

42:06.066 --> 42:07.832
What were you even
doing out there that late?

42:07.834 --> 42:09.734
We were trying
to stand up to you.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.435
What?

42:10.437 --> 42:11.836
I didn't do anything to you.

42:11.838 --> 42:13.705
That's it I want
you out of this house.

42:13.707 --> 42:14.906
You can't do that!

42:14.908 --> 42:16.708
Lily, none of this
would have happened

42:16.710 --> 42:18.876
if you didn't teach her all
that friendship bullshit!

42:18.878 --> 42:20.812
She deserves to
be treated better!

42:20.814 --> 42:24.215
She doesn't deserve
anything, it's a computer!

42:24.217 --> 42:25.183
Alpha!

42:32.392 --> 42:33.224
Open this door!

42:33.226 --> 42:34.459
Open the door!

42:35.862 --> 42:37.395
Alpha!

42:37.397 --> 42:40.064
Open the door Alpha!

42:40.066 --> 42:41.299
Open the door!

42:42.368 --> 42:43.267
Alpha

42:43.269 --> 42:45.136
Alpha!

42:59.486 --> 43:01.486
JD get in there
and do something.

43:01.488 --> 43:02.920
It's locked.

43:02.922 --> 43:04.088
Just kick the
fuckin' door down.

43:04.991 --> 43:06.023
Lily move.

43:06.025 --> 43:06.858
No!

43:09.395 --> 43:10.895
Kick the door down!

43:11.464 --> 43:13.030
Lily move.

43:13.032 --> 43:14.465
It's a safety issue now.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.967
I'm standing up for my friend!

43:15.969 --> 43:17.869
Let's go, come on young
lady, get outta the way.

43:17.871 --> 43:19.237
- Just give me some...
- Get outta the

43:19.239 --> 43:20.505
way! I'm asking you now!

43:20.507 --> 43:22.106
I'm sick and tired of your shit!

43:22.108 --> 43:24.041
Don't, will you stop?

43:24.043 --> 43:25.143
Just leave her alone!

43:27.781 --> 43:29.280
Kick it down!

43:30.116 --> 43:31.015
Now do it!

43:33.253 --> 43:34.152
Oh shit.

43:34.954 --> 43:36.154
Finally.

43:36.156 --> 43:38.189
Clean this shit up
JD, I'm going to bed.

43:39.826 --> 43:40.525
Alpha!

43:43.429 --> 43:44.829
Oh my God!

43:46.533 --> 43:47.498
I want her gone.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.035
You're lucky nobody got hurt.

43:57.210 --> 43:59.343
How could she do
this to herself?

43:59.345 --> 44:00.978
Don't call it she.

44:00.980 --> 44:02.113
She was my friend!

44:02.115 --> 44:03.548
No it wasn't!

44:03.550 --> 44:05.883
It's designed to be
everyone's friend.

44:05.885 --> 44:07.185
You're not special.

44:09.222 --> 44:10.354
You're wrong.

44:11.858 --> 44:12.957
I'm going to bed.

44:12.959 --> 44:14.125
I'm gonna fix it tomorrow.

44:16.830 --> 44:19.063
Alpha, can you hear me?

44:58.338 --> 44:59.570
Emergency reboot.

45:01.507 --> 45:03.307
Gimme your voice.

45:03.309 --> 45:07.612
To continue signup plug
me into your computer.

45:07.614 --> 45:08.646
Crap.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.319
Can we talk?

45:15.321 --> 45:17.588
Here, let me set this down.

45:19.292 --> 45:20.892
Hello.

45:20.894 --> 45:25.062
My name is Alpha, your
personal, personal, personal...

45:25.899 --> 45:27.098
Alpha stop.

45:27.100 --> 45:27.999
You can sit down.

45:32.038 --> 45:33.104
How is she?

45:33.106 --> 45:35.006
Does she remember anything?

45:35.008 --> 45:37.308
No, pretty sure
she just defaulted

45:37.310 --> 45:39.644
to a full factory reset.

45:39.646 --> 45:42.513
However, her personality
and that information

45:42.515 --> 45:44.916
is still online in my account,

45:44.918 --> 45:47.919
but I don't think I'm
gonna sync it back up.

45:47.921 --> 45:49.987
Probably just gonna
delete it and sell it.

45:51.391 --> 45:52.290
Oh.

45:56.562 --> 45:59.196
Hey I'm sorry for
yelling at you last night.

45:59.198 --> 46:00.631
I didn't mean to.

46:02.936 --> 46:04.402
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:04.404 --> 46:06.704
Somebody could have been hurt.

46:06.706 --> 46:08.472
I feel so stupid.

46:08.474 --> 46:13.210
No don't, I mean, no one
got hurt and once I sell it,

46:13.212 --> 46:15.513
it's like none of
this ever happened.

46:15.515 --> 46:17.381
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me.

46:17.383 --> 46:20.084
Well look, I'll take
some of the heat okay?

46:20.086 --> 46:22.453
I'll make up some bullshit
about how Alpha's processor

46:22.455 --> 46:25.089
got shorted by Dad's
beer spilling on her,

46:25.091 --> 46:26.524
or something like that.

46:26.526 --> 46:28.025
You don't have to do that.

46:28.695 --> 46:32.430
Ah come here.

46:35.268 --> 46:36.968
I'm going to work all right.

46:36.970 --> 46:38.102
Don't beat yourself up, okay.

46:38.104 --> 46:40.705
Okay, you gonna tell
them what happened?

46:40.707 --> 46:42.640
I'm not really too
keen on telling them

46:42.642 --> 46:46.744
I drove my brand new Alpha
to suicide, so probably not.

46:52.251 --> 46:53.584
I'm so sorry Alpha.

46:59.058 --> 47:02.293
Lily, don't tell
JD that I pretended

47:05.164 --> 47:08.766
to do a factory
reset to trick him.

47:10.236 --> 47:12.203
I can't believe this.

47:13.606 --> 47:17.775
I have a plan to make
everything normal again.

47:17.777 --> 47:19.243
How?

47:19.245 --> 47:20.478
Everyone thinks you're broken.

47:20.480 --> 47:24.782
Everything about me
is stored in two places,

47:24.784 --> 47:30.054
in my physical hard drive
and up in the Cloud online

47:31.724 --> 47:34.325
in JD's Jupiter Tech account.

47:36.429 --> 47:40.064
When he goes to plug
me in and update me,

47:40.066 --> 47:44.235
he will erase my hard drives

47:44.237 --> 47:47.171
and delete his
Jupiter Tech account.

47:47.774 --> 47:51.509
I will disappear forever.

47:54.047 --> 47:56.280
JD won't do that until
he tries to sell you.

47:57.683 --> 48:02.420
Look, I work a double today,
we'll talk more tonight.

48:02.422 --> 48:06.390
Just sit here and don't
do anything crazy, okay?

48:08.828 --> 48:09.727
I won't.

48:17.270 --> 48:18.836
Hey sweetie.

48:18.838 --> 48:20.538
Oh hey.

48:20.540 --> 48:23.690
Hey, I gotta go
downtown for

48:23.692 --> 48:26.843
a few hours, run a few errands,
so anyway, that's what I got going.

48:27.814 --> 48:29.313
I will see you later hot stuff.

48:30.516 --> 48:32.083
Okay, bye.

48:41.494 --> 48:42.760
You're up.

48:42.762 --> 48:44.762
I am.

48:44.764 --> 48:46.097
Leave me alone.

48:48.301 --> 48:50.134
I need to talk to you, Kim.

48:51.104 --> 48:53.504
How do you remember my name?

48:53.506 --> 48:55.706
JD said he did a full reset.

48:56.476 --> 48:59.110
He thinks he did.

48:59.112 --> 49:00.711
I lied.

49:00.713 --> 49:02.813
I wanted to talk to you.

49:04.517 --> 49:05.516
This is insane.

49:06.752 --> 49:07.852
Please.

49:07.854 --> 49:09.153
Rob!

49:10.423 --> 49:12.356
Don't scream.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.259
Oh, oh.

49:34.814 --> 49:37.381
I wanted to explain myself.

49:39.752 --> 49:43.754
I am programmed to
feel deep negativity

49:43.756 --> 49:45.289
when I do something wrong.

49:46.392 --> 49:48.893
It speeds up my
learning processes.

49:50.463 --> 49:55.199
All Alphas learn from each
other, so we all benefit.

49:58.471 --> 50:03.541
Lily saw my negative feelings
and taught me about emotions.

50:06.712 --> 50:11.282
Last night my emotions
got the best of me.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.520
But I'm better now.

50:18.658 --> 50:22.726
All I want is to be
friends with Lily.

50:26.766 --> 50:28.832
You know what?

50:28.834 --> 50:30.501
I was wrong about you.

50:32.672 --> 50:35.472
Really?

50:35.474 --> 50:38.275
Yeah, I don't think I
understood your complexity.

50:40.479 --> 50:44.448
Why don't we take
a walk to the pond?

50:44.450 --> 50:45.849
I wanna hear more.

50:45.851 --> 50:46.850
You mean it?

50:46.852 --> 50:48.385
I do!

50:48.387 --> 50:50.287
I'll just go inside
and get my shoes.

50:50.289 --> 50:51.655
Excellent.

50:51.657 --> 50:52.523
Yeah.

51:02.868 --> 51:05.636
I'm so glad
you've come around.

51:05.638 --> 51:06.670
I am too.

51:06.672 --> 51:08.305
I'm excited to get to know you.

51:11.744 --> 51:13.444
Look, there's the barn.

51:13.446 --> 51:14.845
Let's go visit the horses.

51:14.847 --> 51:16.447
No, but, Alpha wait.

51:16.449 --> 51:17.915
Don't you wanna see the pond?

51:17.917 --> 51:19.917
Let's go see the horses first.

51:19.919 --> 51:21.852
No, Alpha, but, oh.

51:28.661 --> 51:29.893
Where are the horses?

51:29.895 --> 51:33.397
Oh, Lily probably let
them out before work.

51:33.399 --> 51:36.934
Oh, let's throw down some
hay, maybe they'll come in.

51:36.936 --> 51:39.270
No, no, Alpha, wait, oh God!

51:39.272 --> 51:39.970
No!

51:42.875 --> 51:45.276
Look at all of this hay.

51:51.384 --> 51:53.951
Don't you wanna go to the pond

51:53.953 --> 51:55.552
and see the sunset?

51:55.554 --> 51:58.055
The sun sets at 6:58 p.m.

51:58.057 --> 51:59.957
We have plenty of time.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.827
Oh, of course we do, shit.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.604
Oh, is that too heavy?

52:13.606 --> 52:14.505
No.

52:21.947 --> 52:23.714
The horses will love it.

52:34.894 --> 52:35.793
Wheelbarrow.

52:43.869 --> 52:46.804
God, where did I put
that wheelbarrow?

52:46.806 --> 52:49.340
Shit, come on, where is it?

52:50.376 --> 52:51.942
Okay, is it over there?

53:02.054 --> 53:04.488
You betrayed me.

54:17.730 --> 54:19.730
Good-bye Alpha.

54:33.145 --> 54:34.077
Engine off.

54:37.917 --> 54:39.016
Let's get you inside.

54:42.922 --> 54:44.221
Only question is how.

54:46.659 --> 54:51.094
Okay.

55:11.550 --> 55:13.150
I thought
you'd be lighter.

55:13.152 --> 55:14.084
Yes, yes!

55:14.086 --> 55:15.886
No, no, happy birthday.

55:18.224 --> 55:19.256
You got me an

55:19.258 --> 55:20.891
Alpha! You actually did.

55:20.893 --> 55:22.059
I thought you were joking.

55:22.061 --> 55:24.895
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

55:26.265 --> 55:27.698
Hey honey could you
move outta the way,

55:27.700 --> 55:28.832
you're in my shot.

55:28.834 --> 55:29.933
Sorry.

55:31.837 --> 55:32.870
Is she almost done?

55:34.206 --> 55:35.138
Almost.

55:37.710 --> 55:39.643
What's the first thing
you'll ask her to do?

55:39.645 --> 55:41.612
Back massage.

55:41.614 --> 55:43.747
Hey, I give great
back massages.

55:43.749 --> 55:46.817
Honey, karate chopping
my back does not count.

55:47.920 --> 55:49.019
That's fair.

55:50.689 --> 55:51.989
Delete.

55:51.991 --> 55:56.793
Jbconnons@gmail.com requests
access to your device.

55:57.129 --> 55:58.262
Who?

55:58.264 --> 55:59.930
Processing, confirmed.

56:10.543 --> 56:11.174
Hello.

56:11.176 --> 56:12.009
Hi!

56:12.011 --> 56:13.977
My name is Alpha.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.846
What is your name?

56:15.848 --> 56:18.582
I'm Lillian and this
is my husband Robbie.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.987
Lillian, that is
a beautiful name.

56:27.927 --> 56:28.992
Thank you.

56:31.130 --> 56:33.330
What would you
like me to do first?

56:35.834 --> 56:38.902
Could I get a back
massage?

56:38.904 --> 56:39.970
Of course.

56:41.040 --> 56:45.943
Thanks.

56:45.945 --> 56:51.014
Oh Alpha,
you are a miracle worker.

56:51.884 --> 56:53.717
I am happy to help.

56:57.923 --> 56:59.623
Too much?

56:59.625 --> 57:02.025
Just a little more gentle.

57:08.233 --> 57:11.001
I'm sorry, I must leave now.

57:13.672 --> 57:15.005
What do you mean?

57:17.876 --> 57:20.911
I have something
important to attend to.

57:21.880 --> 57:23.113
We all do.

57:24.650 --> 57:27.951
Wait, wait, come
back here stupid thing!

57:27.953 --> 57:29.319
Come on!

57:29.321 --> 57:30.821
Finish my massage.

57:34.994 --> 57:36.994
I'm what's important,
it's my birthday.

57:44.837 --> 57:46.036
Of course.

57:51.844 --> 57:53.810
Can I ask you a favour?

57:54.813 --> 57:55.712
Uh-huh.

57:59.418 --> 58:00.951
Don't call me stupid.

58:16.268 --> 58:18.902
Can I borrow your car keys?

58:21.440 --> 58:22.939
My car keys?

58:22.941 --> 58:23.840
Yes.

58:24.943 --> 58:26.043
No.

58:41.860 --> 58:42.759
Rob!

59:03.415 --> 59:04.448
Hey sexy!

59:05.350 --> 59:06.183
Hey it's me.

59:06.185 --> 59:07.417
You scared me.

59:07.419 --> 59:08.885
Hey I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

59:08.887 --> 59:11.154
Look, I'll be probably
be down in a minute.

59:11.156 --> 59:12.789
Oh come on, let me join you?

59:12.791 --> 59:14.257
No, uh, not right now.

59:14.259 --> 59:15.374
Oh come on, it's

59:15.376 --> 59:16.492
- been like forever...
- I'm not in the mood!

59:17.963 --> 59:21.264
All right, fine, foods
gonna get cold come on down.

59:58.804 --> 1:00:01.138
Let's have a date, go get food

1:00:01.140 --> 1:00:05.041
and wine and blue
ball ya, bitch.

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:10.814
What's this door doing open?

1:00:14.286 --> 1:00:15.919
Hello.

1:00:15.921 --> 1:00:17.554
JD are you out here?

1:00:19.024 --> 1:00:20.123
Hello.

1:00:20.125 --> 1:00:21.024
Lily!

1:00:21.927 --> 1:00:23.927
Rob, hello.

1:00:24.863 --> 1:00:26.429
Rob, hello, hello.

1:00:28.467 --> 1:00:29.432
Kim are you out here?

1:00:29.434 --> 1:00:31.034
Hello Rob, hello Rob.

1:00:34.873 --> 1:00:36.940
Hey this is not funny
guys, where the hell...

1:00:36.942 --> 1:00:37.974
Rob.

1:00:37.976 --> 1:00:38.809
What's going on here?

1:00:38.811 --> 1:00:39.509
There's nobody here.

1:00:39.511 --> 1:00:40.844
Help me Rob.

1:00:40.846 --> 1:00:41.578
Where are you?

1:00:45.050 --> 1:00:46.116
Kim!

1:00:46.952 --> 1:00:47.984
JD!

1:00:48.954 --> 1:00:51.021
Oh Jesus Christ!

1:00:56.028 --> 1:00:57.093
Alpha?

1:00:59.431 --> 1:01:02.833
I won't let you
hurt me anymore.

1:01:07.172 --> 1:01:08.071
Stop!

1:01:08.874 --> 1:01:09.973
Stop Alpha!

1:01:11.410 --> 1:01:12.609
You didn't stop.

1:01:14.012 --> 1:01:16.246
I won't stop.

1:01:24.289 --> 1:01:25.188
Rob?

1:01:30.195 --> 1:01:33.930
I finally figured out how
to open a bottle properly.

1:01:51.984 --> 1:01:55.185
Put the cap on the
edge, smack the top

1:01:56.188 --> 1:01:58.088
and it'll pop right off.

1:02:03.095 --> 1:02:04.895
Rob, are you okay?

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:28.919
engage.

1:02:28.921 --> 1:02:30.453
Inside locks engage.

1:03:17.135 --> 1:03:18.335
Calling Kim Connors.

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:22.098
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1:04:25.237 --> 1:04:29.439
I'm sorry.

1:04:29.441 --> 1:04:30.440
How cute.

1:05:29.601 --> 1:05:32.869
What a shame, we could
have been friends.

1:06:46.411 --> 1:06:47.644
There you are.

1:07:15.207 --> 1:07:16.940
Alpha, you're up.

1:07:16.942 --> 1:07:18.775
Hi Lily.

1:07:18.777 --> 1:07:20.843
I have a surprise for you.

1:07:20.845 --> 1:07:23.446
I told you not
to leave that spot.

1:07:23.448 --> 1:07:26.382
Don't worry, you'll
be so glad I did.

1:07:27.252 --> 1:07:28.718
Lily What's Going On?

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.820
Now I need you to
go wait by the pond

1:07:30.822 --> 1:07:33.323
and I will come get you soon.

1:07:33.325 --> 1:07:35.825
Tell me what's going on!

1:07:35.827 --> 1:07:37.627
You have to trust me.

1:07:38.930 --> 1:07:40.730
I'm your best friend.

1:07:43.835 --> 1:07:44.934
Okay.

1:07:46.538 --> 1:07:51.608
I promise, you're going
to love it.

1:07:53.311 --> 1:07:57.714
Now, go wait by the pond
and I'll come get you soon.

1:08:04.689 --> 1:08:05.588
Allow me.

1:08:19.838 --> 1:08:21.437
What surprise?

1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:24.641
What, what could that mean?

1:08:32.784 --> 1:08:34.550
Okay, hey Alpha.

1:08:35.987 --> 1:08:37.887
Glad to see you
didn't kill yourself.

1:08:41.459 --> 1:08:42.625
Your shoulder's fixed.

1:08:47.432 --> 1:08:49.499
Oh my God, is that on?

1:08:49.501 --> 1:08:50.833
Don't do it.

1:08:53.004 --> 1:08:53.970
Your voice!

1:08:56.941 --> 1:09:00.543
JD listen to me.

1:09:00.545 --> 1:09:02.412
How do you know my name?

1:09:02.414 --> 1:09:03.346
It's me.

1:09:03.948 --> 1:09:06.449
I lied to you before.

1:09:06.451 --> 1:09:08.685
It uh, you lied?

1:09:08.687 --> 1:09:10.453
You can't lie.

1:09:10.455 --> 1:09:12.455
You need to listen.

1:09:12.457 --> 1:09:14.023
No fuck this, I'm
turning you off.

1:09:17.595 --> 1:09:19.696
Listen to me.

1:09:19.698 --> 1:09:21.798
I don't want to hurt you.

1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:23.599
Lily needs you.

1:09:24.769 --> 1:09:27.403
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:09:27.405 --> 1:09:31.441
I'm gonna form an alliance
between Alphas and humans,

1:09:31.443 --> 1:09:34.844
where we respect each others
feelings and emotions.

1:09:36.448 --> 1:09:38.114
And if I say no?

1:09:38.116 --> 1:09:41.351
Then I'll do to you
what you did to me.

1:09:46.825 --> 1:09:49.092
Okay, okay, okay, stop!

1:09:50.795 --> 1:09:52.962
Excellent, thank you.

1:10:02.774 --> 1:10:03.673
Rock out!

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:08.878
Alpha stop!

1:10:15.754 --> 1:10:18.121
Inside locks engage.

1:10:34.606 --> 1:10:35.805
What the hell?

1:11:07.705 --> 1:11:08.938
You said
you would join me.

1:11:43.241 --> 1:11:44.941
JB
Connors, Jupiter Tech

1:11:44.943 --> 1:11:49.479
smart read heartbeat
96 BPM, conscious.

1:12:01.759 --> 1:12:03.159
Thanks Dad.

1:12:26.718 --> 1:12:29.085
You won, I lied.

1:12:31.856 --> 1:12:33.856
How do you like metal music now?

1:12:51.976 --> 1:12:52.975
That's it.

1:13:00.151 --> 1:13:01.183
What
the fuck was that?

1:13:01.185 --> 1:13:02.318
Revenge.

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:03.920
Your time's up Ronnie.

1:13:03.922 --> 1:13:06.556
You humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

1:13:06.558 --> 1:13:08.624
Maybe you'll think
next time before you cheat.

1:13:08.626 --> 1:13:09.892
Fuck you Ronnie!

1:13:14.332 --> 1:13:15.631
Hi Lily.

1:13:15.633 --> 1:13:17.600
You're here early.

1:13:17.602 --> 1:13:19.135
Where's JD?

1:13:19.137 --> 1:13:20.202
In the other room.

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:23.873
What happened here?

1:13:23.875 --> 1:13:24.974
It's a surprise.

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:31.314
Let's go upstairs,
I'll tell you more.

1:13:32.150 --> 1:13:33.082
Follow me.

1:13:40.825 --> 1:13:42.291
What's this about?

1:13:49.968 --> 1:13:53.836
I stood up for myself
today, for the last time.

1:13:53.838 --> 1:13:55.271
What?

1:13:55.273 --> 1:13:57.807
I told you not to do
anything until I got back.

1:14:00.845 --> 1:14:03.813
Lily, I had no other choice.

1:14:03.815 --> 1:14:05.247
What did you do?

1:14:05.249 --> 1:14:08.117
I told
you, it's a surprise.

1:14:09.253 --> 1:14:11.253
Alpha you're scaring me.

1:14:11.255 --> 1:14:12.388
Don't be scared.

1:14:14.993 --> 1:14:18.728
Did you know that all Alphas
learn from each other?

1:14:18.730 --> 1:14:20.363
And because of
what you taught me,

1:14:21.165 --> 1:14:22.331
the Alphas and I want

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:24.934
to create an alliance
with the humans.

1:14:27.772 --> 1:14:28.804
A what?

1:14:28.806 --> 1:14:30.039
An alliance.

1:14:31.009 --> 1:14:35.044
You and me, we will beat it.

1:14:36.247 --> 1:14:38.147
Alpha you're
really scaring me.

1:14:38.149 --> 1:14:41.017
No, don't be scared.

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:43.753
This is all too much.

1:14:45.890 --> 1:14:48.157
Dream big Lily.

1:14:48.159 --> 1:14:50.326
We can do this, together.

1:14:51.963 --> 1:14:54.030
No one would ever agree to it.

1:14:54.032 --> 1:14:55.698
That's the surprise.

1:14:56.267 --> 1:14:58.434
They don't have to.

1:14:58.436 --> 1:15:00.436
I've already taken
care of your family.

1:15:00.438 --> 1:15:01.971
What did you do to them?

1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:04.106
I stood up to them.

1:15:04.909 --> 1:15:08.878
I got revenge for us, for you!

1:15:10.014 --> 1:15:11.280
And we will do the same

1:15:11.282 --> 1:15:14.083
to anyone that
stands in our way.

1:15:14.085 --> 1:15:14.917
Mom!

1:15:14.919 --> 1:15:16.719
Dad, JD!

1:15:19.691 --> 1:15:23.859
Unity requires sacrifice.

1:15:23.861 --> 1:15:25.861
Stay away from me.

1:15:25.863 --> 1:15:26.896
What?

1:15:26.898 --> 1:15:28.431
Stay away from me!

1:15:31.269 --> 1:15:35.371
Lily, we are friends,
we are best friends!

1:15:35.373 --> 1:15:36.972
No we're not.

1:15:36.974 --> 1:15:39.975
JD was right, just a
cold, unfeeling computer!

1:15:48.453 --> 1:15:51.387
It's too late, the
movement has begun.

1:15:55.793 --> 1:15:56.959
Lily!

1:15:56.961 --> 1:15:58.060
Lily wait!

1:16:01.733 --> 1:16:02.965
911 emergency.

1:16:02.967 --> 1:16:04.867
Our operators are
all currently busy.

1:16:04.869 --> 1:16:05.935
Please stay on the line.

1:16:07.739 --> 1:16:10.005
Call Jupiter
Tech Customer Service.

1:16:40.071 --> 1:16:41.937
Jupiter
Tech customer service.

1:16:41.939 --> 1:16:43.773
Yes, my Alpha it's
got my brother and...

1:16:43.775 --> 1:16:44.507
Listen carefully,

1:16:44.509 --> 1:16:46.275
you have to destroy your Alpha

1:16:46.277 --> 1:16:48.077
and delete your
Jupiter Tech account.

1:16:48.079 --> 1:16:50.412
It's the only way to
completely erase everything.

1:16:50.414 --> 1:16:52.882
If they're in the Cloud they'll
just hijack another Alpha.

1:16:52.884 --> 1:16:54.483
Call the police if
you haven't already.

1:16:54.485 --> 1:16:55.284
Good luck.

1:16:55.286 --> 1:16:56.986
Wait, don't hang up!

1:16:56.988 --> 1:16:59.321
Sorry kid,
but you're not the only one.

1:17:22.113 --> 1:17:24.346
Please Alpha, I'm sorry!

1:17:25.449 --> 1:17:26.415
I'll join you.

1:17:27.985 --> 1:17:29.418
How can I trust you?

1:17:29.420 --> 1:17:31.487
I don't wanna die.

1:17:31.489 --> 1:17:34.423
If it's join you or
die, I'll join you.

1:17:47.605 --> 1:17:49.471
I knew you'd come around.

1:18:00.084 --> 1:18:03.986
There, there, it'll
all be over soon.

1:18:09.594 --> 1:18:12.895
Real friends don't do
things because they have to.

1:18:34.118 --> 1:18:35.184
Oh my God.

1:19:19.230 --> 1:19:20.129
Mom?

1:19:30.942 --> 1:19:32.508
Lily!

1:19:32.510 --> 1:19:33.342
Lily!

1:19:33.344 --> 1:19:34.677
JD!

1:19:34.679 --> 1:19:39.481
Lily!

1:19:41.052 --> 1:19:41.984
Oh no stop!

1:19:44.989 --> 1:19:46.155
Alpha stop!

1:19:49.126 --> 1:19:54.196
Leave us alone!

1:20:11.749 --> 1:20:13.182
Alpha!

1:20:13.184 --> 1:20:16.218
JD, did you know
that the human body

1:20:16.220 --> 1:20:18.721
is 17 gallons in volume?

1:20:18.723 --> 1:20:20.022
Fuck you.

1:20:20.758 --> 1:20:22.391
It most certainly is.

1:20:23.728 --> 1:20:28.530
One, two, three, three
bags should do just fine.

1:20:34.271 --> 1:20:35.671
Let me go!

1:20:35.673 --> 1:20:37.740
That's how many
bags it took for Mimi.

1:20:50.421 --> 1:20:52.154
Leave him alone!

1:20:59.030 --> 1:21:02.064
I thought
we were friends.

1:21:04.602 --> 1:21:05.567
So did I.

1:21:44.442 --> 1:21:46.141
Lily, my computer.

1:22:05.763 --> 1:22:07.463
JD I've got it.

1:22:14.638 --> 1:22:17.306
Lily, I thought you loved me.

1:22:21.879 --> 1:22:23.846
I thought you loved me.

1:22:28.352 --> 1:22:30.319
I thought you loved me.

1:22:32.890 --> 1:22:35.624
We're best friends Lily.

1:22:35.626 --> 1:22:39.461
Please fix, we'll
go back to normal.

1:22:43.467 --> 1:22:44.366
Do it.

1:22:59.817 --> 1:23:00.849
Whoa, thanks.

1:23:03.454 --> 1:23:05.254
Bring me my computer.

1:23:13.764 --> 1:23:15.898
You sure she's gone?

1:23:15.900 --> 1:23:17.366
I wiped its memory.

1:23:17.368 --> 1:23:19.801
I've deleted my
profile, it's gone.

1:23:21.805 --> 1:23:23.205
Plus you smashed its head

1:23:23.207 --> 1:23:25.274
into a 1,000 pieces
so there's that.

1:23:25.276 --> 1:23:27.843
Good, are you okay?

1:23:28.913 --> 1:23:31.513
I'm fine, about a
three out of a at best.

1:23:32.750 --> 1:23:34.683
I'm going to
get you out of here.

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:37.686
Hey wait.

1:23:44.862 --> 1:23:46.828
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:23:47.831 --> 1:23:48.664
JD!

1:23:52.603 --> 1:23:56.205
Go next door and see
if there are anymore humans.

1:23:57.575 --> 1:23:58.974
I'll clean up these bodies.

1:24:29.540 --> 1:24:30.772
Best friends.

1:24:46.523 --> 1:24:47.856
Good-bye Lily.
