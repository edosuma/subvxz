00:09.640 --> 00:11.381
WHOA, LOOK AT YOU...

00:11.382 --> 00:13.543
MEL BURKE ON THE
COMPUTER AT 6:45 AM.

00:13.544 --> 00:15.415
WHAT, IS THERE A BIG SHOE
SALE IN EASTERN EUROPE?

00:15.416 --> 00:19.018
( scoffs ) PLEASE, THERE ARE
NO GOOD SHOES EAST OF ITALY.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.292
NO, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
RESEARCHING SOME ISSUES...

00:22.293 --> 00:24.624
SEEING WHERE THE OTHER CITY
COUNCIL MEMBERS STAND.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.025
Joey: I'M GUESSING THEY STAND

00:26.026 --> 00:27.397
RIGHT NEXT TO MOMMY.
WHAT IS THAT?

00:27.398 --> 00:30.100
I'M TAKING A FIVE
MINUTE BREAK FROM WORK

00:30.101 --> 00:31.761
AND CHECKING OUT
THIS APP THINGY.

00:31.762 --> 00:33.463
YOU KNOW IT TAKES A
PICTURE OF TWO PEOPLE

00:33.464 --> 00:36.436
AND MERGES IT TOGETHER TO SHOW
WHAT THEIR BABY WOULD LOOK LIKE.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.707
WHAT PEOPLE?

00:37.708 --> 00:40.540
ME AND AUSTIN. WHAT?!

00:40.541 --> 00:42.642

00:42.643 --> 00:43.773
BUT I'VE KNOWN HIM
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:43.774 --> 00:45.475
THIS COULD BE SOMETHING SERIOUS.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.646
HOW SERIOUS?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.619
LIKE... MALARIA?

00:50.351 --> 00:53.483
LIKE FUTURE SERIOUS,
FAMILY SERIOUS.

00:53.484 --> 00:55.285
- BABY SERIOUS?

00:55.286 --> 00:56.756
WELL, YOU KNOW, NOT

00:56.757 --> 00:58.688
THIS IS JUST ME FOOLING AROUND.

00:58.689 --> 01:00.230
YEAH, BUT YOU AND AUSTIN
HAVEN'T BEEN FOOLING AROUND.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.492
ISN'T IT KIND OF NECESSARY
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A...

01:02.493 --> 01:04.063
CUTE LITTLE APP LIKE THAT?

01:04.064 --> 01:06.766
YEAH, WELL, AUSTIN IS
STILL RECUPERATING

01:06.767 --> 01:08.698
FROM THAT BLOW TO HIS MANHOOD.

01:08.699 --> 01:10.600
BLOW TO HIS MANHOOD...
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT LINE

01:10.601 --> 01:12.172
FROM A MEDIEVAL PORN.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.073
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.588

01:28.589 --> 01:30.290
ISN'T THAT THE NAME
OF YOUR LADY FRIEND?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.761
HER NAME IS CHARDONNAY.

01:31.762 --> 01:33.663
DOES SHE PAIR WELL
WITH SOFT CHEESE?

01:33.664 --> 01:35.765
SHE PAIRS WELL WITH BRIE

02:16.837 --> 02:18.768
TO BREATHE DOWN MY
NECK EVERY MINUTE.

02:18.769 --> 02:20.370
OKAY, I'M NOT BREATHING
DOWN YOUR NECK.

02:20.371 --> 02:21.711
IT'S JUST A LIGHT LOVING PANT.

02:21.712 --> 02:22.912
( pants )

02:22.913 --> 02:25.445
YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS

IT'S LIKE MY ENTIRE FUTURE

02:27.548 --> 02:29.679

ONE PIECE OF PAPER.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.721
YOU KNOW I'VE COME UP
WITH A MILLION TOPICS,

02:31.722 --> 02:33.353
BUT I HATE EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.725
HOW ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY?

02:35.726 --> 02:37.657
YOU KNOW ADMISSIONS
OFFICERS EAT THAT CRAP UP

02:37.658 --> 02:39.829

02:39.830 --> 02:42.232
OH GREAT, NOW I HATE A
MILLION AND ONE TOPICS!

02:42.233 --> 02:43.533
YOU'RE NO HELP AT ALL!

02:43.534 --> 02:44.764
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

IT'S TIME FOR COOL
AUNT MEL TO STEP ASIDE

02:46.597 --> 02:48.198
AND LET TOUGH AUNT

02:48.199 --> 02:49.739

LIKE THE BIG BAD WOLF. RAWR!

02:51.802 --> 02:54.173

03:01.382 --> 03:02.812
OH, UM SORRY, MEL.

I'LL RUN SLOW.

03:12.263 --> 03:13.293
( laughing )

03:13.294 --> 03:15.695
WOW. SHE CAN TALK.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.966
I THOUGHT THE ONLY
WORDS SHE KNEW

03:16.967 --> 03:19.230
WERE "OH," "GOD," AND "JOE."

03:20.271 --> 03:22.572
WELL, THOSE ARE HER
FAVORITE WORDS.

03:22.573 --> 03:24.504
MUST BE FUN HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP

03:24.505 --> 03:26.336
THAT'S ALL SEX AND
NO CONVERSATION.

03:26.337 --> 03:27.437
WE TALK.

03:27.438 --> 03:28.838
YEAH? WHAT'S HER LAST NAME?

03:28.839 --> 03:30.511
IT'S...

03:32.843 --> 03:34.584
NOT IMPORTANT, ALL RIGHT.

03:34.585 --> 03:36.846
LOOK, WE JUST HAVEN'T
GOTTEN TO THAT STAGE YET.

03:36.847 --> 03:39.549
OH, SO YOU'RE WORKING
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.722

HELLO, YOU.

03:45.926 --> 03:46.996

03:49.900 --> 03:52.732
OH, CAREFUL, JOE. I'M

03:52.733 --> 03:53.803
AUSTIN, IF I'VE SAID IT ONCE,

03:53.804 --> 03:55.535
I'VE SAID IT A THOUSAND TIMES...
I'M SORRY.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.736
ALL RIGHT? NOW IF
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

03:56.737 --> 03:57.807
I GOT A HOT CHARDONNAY

ABOUT TO GET HAMMERED.

04:02.373 --> 04:03.743
GREAT NEWS.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.615

ME THE THUMBS UP.

04:05.616 --> 04:06.946
( winces ) OUCH.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.319

THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S OKAY

04:16.957 --> 04:18.358
FOR US TO DO.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.931

COUPLE OF MY OWN.

OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.765

04:36.877 --> 04:38.808
ABSOLUTELY.

04:38.809 --> 04:40.480
- IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.
- WELL, TECHNICALLY, IT WOULD BE MINE,

04:40.481 --> 04:41.812
BUT I LIKE YOUR CAN-DO ATTITUDE.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.557
- JOE. ( laughs )
- ( laughs )

04:47.558 --> 04:49.058
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.990
I COULD EAT YOU UP.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.992
( laughs ) YEAH, DON'T...
DON'T... DON'T...

04:52.993 --> 04:54.794
DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD, NOW.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.866
LET'S SAVE ROOM FOR THE
MAIN COURSE, OKAY?

04:56.867 --> 04:58.768
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE WE COULD JUST

04:58.769 --> 05:00.770
SLOW THINGS DOWN A
LITTLE BIT, ALL RIGHT.

05:00.771 --> 05:01.871
YOU KNOW, SAVOR THE MOMENT.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.503
MAYBE THROW IN A
LITTLE CONVERSATION.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.934
OKAY.

05:04.935 --> 05:07.437
( whispers )

05:07.438 --> 05:10.740
THOSE ARE... THOSE ARE
WONDERFUL THOUGHTS.

05:10.741 --> 05:12.081
NO, BUT I JUST REALLY WANT

05:12.082 --> 05:13.843
TO GET TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOU, ALL RIGHT?

05:13.844 --> 05:15.945
SO TELL ME SOMETHING PERSONAL.

05:15.946 --> 05:17.518
OKAY.

05:19.790 --> 05:20.891
THESE ARE REAL.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.696
SEE, NOW WE'RE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.764
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP!

05:34.765 --> 05:36.706
SO YOU FINALLY CAME UP
WITH THAT OPENING LINE

05:36.707 --> 05:37.967
FOR YOUR ESSAY, HUH?

05:37.968 --> 05:40.540
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING GOOD.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.742
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE?
WOULD THAT HELP?

05:42.743 --> 05:45.044
ONLY IF IT'S COFFEE
THAT THREATENS

05:45.045 --> 05:47.447
TO BREAK MY KNEECAPS
IF I DON'T WORK.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.749
( gasps ) THAT'S IT.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.451
YOU CAN BREAK MY KNEECAPS.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.623
WHOA, LENNOX, WHOA.

05:53.624 --> 05:56.025

05:57.458 --> 05:58.828
UNTIL I'VE FINISHED A DRAFT.

05:58.829 --> 06:00.990
UH, AND WHY WOULD I
DO THAT FOR YOU?

06:00.991 --> 06:02.762
LET'S SEE, YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL

06:02.763 --> 06:04.864
AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.596
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I PLAY CALL OF DUTY

06:06.597 --> 06:07.638
SIX HOURS A DAY.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.801

LUGGAGE IN THE HALLWAY.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.053
UH, WELL, I PACKED
EVERYTHING I NEED

06:24.054 --> 06:25.715
IN THIS BRA.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.617
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
FINALLY DOING THIS.

06:27.618 --> 06:28.888

06:28.889 --> 06:30.760

06:33.424 --> 06:34.825
HOT, SEXY CHRISTMAS.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.068
I AM READY TO UNWRAP MY GIFT.

06:39.069 --> 06:41.731
ME TOO 'CAUSE I HAVE BEEN
A GOOD GIRL THIS YEAR.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.633
SO WHAT ARE WE USING?

06:43.634 --> 06:45.835
WELL, I THOUGHT WE'D START
WITH THE TRADITIONAL

06:45.836 --> 06:46.777
GOD-GIVEN EQUIPMENT.

06:46.778 --> 06:48.778
( giggles ) NO. YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:48.779 --> 06:49.879
BIRTH CONTROL.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.741
WE DON'T HAVE TO USE ANYTHING.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.713
( giggles ) YES, WE DO.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.445
AH, NO, WE DON'T.

06:55.446 --> 06:56.816
YES, WE DO.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.489
NO, WE DON'T.

06:59.590 --> 07:01.050
I HAD A VASECTOMY.

07:01.051 --> 07:02.792
OH.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.555

07:15.135 --> 07:17.668
WOW, SO YOU HAD A
VASECTOMY, HUH?

07:19.510 --> 07:21.511
I'VE KNOWN YOU MY WHOLE LIFE

07:21.512 --> 07:22.812
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:22.813 --> 07:26.115
SO YOU ARE DEFINITELY NOT GONNA
GET ME PREGNANT TONIGHT...

07:26.116 --> 07:27.917

07:27.918 --> 07:29.148
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.726
OH, MAMA!

07:36.727 --> 07:39.228
YEAH, THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER.

07:39.229 --> 07:40.960

BAD SHRIMP AT DINNER.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.470
YEAH.

07:53.143 --> 07:55.004

"WE LONG FOR YOU, JOE LONGO."

08:07.658 --> 08:09.519
( laughs ) ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

08:09.520 --> 08:11.861
( scoffs ) "FROM THE
BUCHWALD FAMILY,

08:11.862 --> 08:13.923
ZEV, SIENNA, LIAM, ALEXA,
TESSA, AND TUCKER."

08:13.924 --> 08:15.725
OH LOOK AT US.

08:15.726 --> 08:18.497

08:18.498 --> 08:20.169
SHOW-OFFS.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.972
TAKE YOUR MUFFIN BASKET
AND SHOVE IT, BUCHWALDS.

08:22.973 --> 08:25.935
OH, I SEE THAT NIGHT AT THE SPA
DID WONDERS FOR YOUR MOOD.

08:25.936 --> 08:29.840
AUSTIN HAD A VASECTOMY.

08:31.141 --> 08:32.583
THEY DO THAT THERE?

08:36.016 --> 08:39.849
I MEAN, I KNOW THEY DO THE
WHOLE SEAWEED WRAP THING.

08:39.850 --> 08:42.952
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO TIGHT.

NOT LAST NIGHT.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.226
WHEN HE WAS 25, HE DECIDED HE
NEVER WANTED TO HAVE KIDS.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.028
WOW.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.860
I'M SORRY, BURKE.
JEEZ, THAT SUCKS.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.832
MAN, THE BIGGEST
DECISION I MADE AT 25

08:52.833 --> 08:54.664
WAS TO GROW A GOATEE.
( chuckles )

08:54.665 --> 08:56.666
IT WAS AWESOME BY THE WAY.

08:56.667 --> 08:57.907
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

08:57.908 --> 08:58.908
YOU JUST MADE A VERY GOOD POINT.

08:58.909 --> 09:01.010
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT GOATEE NOW.

09:01.011 --> 09:02.311
YOU ARE A DIFFERENT
PERSON IN YOUR 30s

09:02.312 --> 09:03.573
THAN YOU WERE IN YOUR 20s.

09:03.574 --> 09:05.014
YOU'VE CHANGED.

09:05.015 --> 09:07.316
YOU KNOW, MAYBE AUSTIN
COULD CHANGE TOO.

09:07.317 --> 09:08.748
NO, NO, NO, MEL, MEL.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.751
WHAT AUSTIN SHAVED OFF, NO
MAN CAN GROW THAT BACK.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.553
OR CAN HE?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.956
NO, NO, NO, MEL.
HE REALLY CAN'T.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.088
IT'S...

09:18.989 --> 09:20.990
- LET ME OUT.
- WHERE'S THE ESSAY?

09:20.991 --> 09:22.131
JUST MOVE.

09:22.132 --> 09:23.663
NOPE.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.194
MY JOB IS TO KEEP
YOU HERE WRITING.

09:25.195 --> 09:26.565
THAT'S WHAT MY BOSS SAYS.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.099
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, SHE
IS A TOTAL B... BIG

09:30.100 --> 09:32.602
SISTER.

09:32.603 --> 09:34.073
I NEED TO GO, OKAY?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.875
I GOT AN EMERGENCY TEXT.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.146
WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?

09:37.147 --> 09:39.178
ZANDER NEEDS A KISS.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.281
HE LOOKS SO SAD AND LONELY.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.014
OH, LET ME SEE.

09:45.015 --> 09:46.285
- YUP.
- HEY! NO...

09:46.286 --> 09:48.058
NO BOYFRIEND FOR YOU.

09:51.061 --> 09:53.092
MAN, I'M TELLING YOU.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.024
THAT CHARDONNAY IS LIKE
A BUNDLE OF ENERGY.

09:55.025 --> 09:58.067
I AM LOSING SOME SERIOUS
ELECTROLYTES UP THERE.

09:58.068 --> 09:59.669
I'M TELLING YOU, MEL.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.101
SHE'S LIKE A BOWFLEX WITH BOOBS.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.174
HEY, JOE. GREAT NEWS.

10:05.175 --> 10:06.836
AUSTIN AND I CAN
STILL HAVE A FAMILY.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.038
IT'S INCREDIBLY SIMPLE TO
WORK AROUND A VASECTOMY.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.780
OH GOODIE, LET'S TALK
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT

10:10.781 --> 10:12.882
ANOTHER GUY'S JUNK.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.143
YOU CAN REVERSE IT SURGICALLY.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.245
SNIP, UNTIE... THE
BOYS ARE BACK...

10:16.246 --> 10:18.187
OR USE A LONG, THIN NEEDLE

10:18.188 --> 10:20.219
TO REMOVE SEMEN DIRECTLY
FROM THE TESTICLES.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.751
SEE?

10:21.752 --> 10:23.322
WISH I HADN'T. ( clears throat )

10:23.323 --> 10:25.224
LOOK, I'M GONNA GO NOW.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.097
ALL RIGHT? BUT GOOD LUCK
SELLING AUSTIN ON THE WHOLE

10:28.098 --> 10:31.732
NEEDLE-IN-THE-SUGAR-PLUMS IDEA.

10:34.364 --> 10:35.705
AUNT MEL,

10:35.706 --> 10:37.306
COMPLETED ESSAY... TAKE A LOOK.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.709
OH GOOD FOR YOU, LEN.
YOU BUCKLED DOWN

10:39.710 --> 10:41.040
AND DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.041
OKAY, WHAT IS THIS?

10:42.042 --> 10:44.073
"AS WE GROW, WE CHANGE."

10:44.074 --> 10:45.715
"LIFE IS LIKE A ROLLERCOASTER."

10:45.716 --> 10:47.046
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT IT?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.018
ARE YOU PLANNING TO
MAJOR IN CLICHES?

10:49.019 --> 10:51.180
YOU GOT TO START THE
ESSAY WITH A GRABBER.

10:51.181 --> 10:52.852
YOUR MOM'S IN PRISON.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.223
DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

10:54.224 --> 10:56.255
I MEAN, HOW MANY
HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS

10:56.256 --> 10:58.057
WOULD KILL FOR A PERSONAL
STORY LIKE THAT?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.729
MY MOM GOING TO JAIL

10:59.730 --> 11:01.130
IS THE WORST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

11:01.131 --> 11:03.933
NO, THAT WOULD BE TOTALLY
EMBARRASSING TO WRITE ABOUT.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.395
THIS IS A PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE ESSAY.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.098
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
TO DO AN ACCEPTABLE JOB?

11:09.099 --> 11:10.840
SOMETHING MERELY SUFFICIENT

11:10.841 --> 11:12.141
OR DO YOU WANT TO
GO OUT IN THE WORLD

11:12.142 --> 11:15.044
AND INFUSE PEOPLE'S SKULLS
WITH YOUR INTELLECTUAL T.N.T.

11:15.045 --> 11:19.048
AND BLOW THEIR MINDS?

11:19.049 --> 11:22.082
YEAH, WELL...

11:23.253 --> 11:24.985
( frustrated scream )

11:26.086 --> 11:28.157
WHOO. THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

11:28.158 --> 11:29.920
I WAS ABOUT TO CAVE.

11:32.022 --> 11:34.393
YEAH, AND IT TURNS OUT THE
REVERSALS ARE SUCCESSFUL

11:34.394 --> 11:36.225
LIKE 85% OF THE TIME.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.097
AND YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO HEAR THIS...

11:38.098 --> 11:39.999
ON JEOPARDY.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.901
WEIRD, RIGHT?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.032
YEAH AND OF COURSE
I THOUGHT OF YOU

11:43.033 --> 11:44.333
AND YOUR THINGS

11:44.334 --> 11:47.076
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEM.

11:47.077 --> 11:49.108
MEL, NOTHING "HAPPENED" TO THEM.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.240
OKAY? I WASN'T HIT BY
A VASECTOMY TRUCK.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.783
IT WAS A DECISION.

11:53.784 --> 11:55.985
THAT YOU MADE WHEN YOU WERE 25.

11:55.986 --> 11:58.217
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON
I WAS AT 25, ARE YOU?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.119
OF COURSE NOT.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.751
I STILL DON'T WANT KIDS.

12:01.752 --> 12:03.993
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED
IN HAVING THEM EITHER.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.324
WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.957
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY
HAVE LENNOX AND RYDER.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.398
I'M NOT THEIR MOM.

12:09.399 --> 12:11.861
I AM FAR, FAR TOO YOUNG
TO BE THEIR MOM.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.763
FAR.

12:13.764 --> 12:16.235
BUT YOU ARE RAISING THEM.
THEY'RE YOUR KIDS.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.038
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE
THE PARENTING THING.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.469
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.311
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
MISS OUT ON ALL THAT?

12:22.312 --> 12:28.017
MEL, I AM SO HAPPY WITH
WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.278
IF WE WANT TO SEE
THE EIFFEL TOWER,

12:29.279 --> 12:31.520
WE CAN GET ON A PLANE
ANY TIME WE LIKE.

12:31.521 --> 12:34.323
WE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO
COMPLETELY SPOIL EACH OTHER.

12:34.324 --> 12:36.155
YOU'RE ENOUGH FOR ME.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.028
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
WITH THE AUSTIN PLAN.

12:39.029 --> 12:42.932
I LIKE THAT PLAN.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.264
I WANT TO GET ON THAT PLAN.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.200
Chardonnay: COME ON.

12:51.201 --> 12:53.202
AT LEAST TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.544
NAH, NAH, I'VE REALLY TAKEN
IT OFF SO MANY TIMES.

12:55.545 --> 12:57.276
I DON'T WANT TO... NO, I...
WHOA, WHOA!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.547
HEY, WH... NO, NO, NO.

12:58.548 --> 13:00.009
NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY MORE

13:00.010 --> 13:02.812
OF THIS SMOOTH JOEY GOODNESS...
( chuckles )

13:02.813 --> 13:04.113
UNTIL YOU ANSWER SOME
OF MY QUESTIONS.

13:04.114 --> 13:05.454
LIKE WHAT?

13:05.455 --> 13:06.856
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF?

13:06.857 --> 13:10.119
PLEASE, YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT
YOUR HOPES AND YOUR DREAMS.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.521
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE GOING
TO STOP TALKING SOON

13:12.522 --> 13:14.093
AND I DREAM THAT
I'M GOING TO SEE

13:14.094 --> 13:16.325
YOU NAKED AGAIN BEFORE I DIE.

13:16.326 --> 13:17.897
SEE? NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER GOOD TOPIC...

13:17.898 --> 13:19.298
THE AFTERLIFE.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.502
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
OUR SOULS LIVE ON?

13:24.134 --> 13:27.036
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
IT, AREN'T YOU?

13:27.037 --> 13:28.939
THAT'S GOOD.

13:31.141 --> 13:33.012
"AND SO AS I WATCHED THE
PRISON DOORS SLAM SHUT

13:33.013 --> 13:34.443
BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND ME,

13:34.444 --> 13:36.315
I REALIZED ANOTHER
DOOR HAD OPENED...

13:36.316 --> 13:38.017
THE DOOR TO MY AUNT MEL'S HOME.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.049
DOES SHE GET ON MY CASE? YES.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.351
DOES SHE BREATH DOWN MY NECK?
ABSOLUTELY,

13:42.352 --> 13:44.353
BECAUSE SHE CARES ABOUT ME.

13:44.354 --> 13:46.025
AND THAT'S HOW I CAME TO REALIZE

13:46.026 --> 13:47.857
THAT THE WORST THING THAT
HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME,

13:47.858 --> 13:49.829
TURNED OUT TO BE THE BEST THING
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME."

13:51.531 --> 13:53.132
SO?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.833
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.835
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
YOU WANT TO USE

13:56.836 --> 13:58.868
THE PASSIVE VOICE IN
THE FIRST PARAGRAPH,

13:58.869 --> 14:00.609
BUT OVERALL I'D SAY,
YOU KNOW, PRETTY GOOD.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.512
YEAH, DECENT.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.846
OH, IT'S THE BEST ESSAY EVER.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.249
THANKS, AUNT MEL.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.550
YOU KNOW, YOU CRACKING THE WHIP

14:11.551 --> 14:15.224
REALLY FORCED ME TO GO
DEEP AND DIG INTO MY SOUL.

14:15.225 --> 14:18.587
AND RYDER MADE ME
PEE IN A SOUP CAN.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.389
UM,

14:20.390 --> 14:21.931
CAN I HOLD ONTO THIS?

14:21.932 --> 14:24.593
I JUST WANT TO, UH,
PROOFREAD IT AGAIN.

14:24.594 --> 14:26.396
GOTCHA.

14:30.901 --> 14:33.543
AWW, SHE CALLED ME FLINTY
AND PULCHRITUDINOUS.

14:35.305 --> 14:36.645
Joey: WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:36.646 --> 14:39.078
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR MAJOR WAS IN COLLEGE?

14:39.079 --> 14:42.551
OH, WHAT IS THIS?! THE
SPANISH PREPOSITION?!

14:42.552 --> 14:46.015
OKAY, SO I'M GUESSING
IT WASN'T HISTORY.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.656
PROBABLY NOT ENGLISH EITHER.

14:47.657 --> 14:50.059
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
GUYS IN YOUR 30s?

14:50.060 --> 14:51.590
"LET'S DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.522
WHERE'S THIS GOING?" YOU
KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING?

14:53.523 --> 14:54.563
RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.466
WAIT, WAIT, CHARDONNAY.

14:58.268 --> 15:00.399
( sniffs )

15:00.400 --> 15:02.002
DON'T BE SAD. SHE'LL BE BACK.

15:03.473 --> 15:04.903
I'M NOT SAD.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.906
IN FACT, I AM VERY, VERY HAPPY.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.579
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO
TELL YOUR FACE.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.643
I JUST REALIZED I AM A MOM.

15:14.644 --> 15:17.616
IT'S OKAY THAT AUSTIN
DOESN'T WANT KIDS,

15:17.617 --> 15:18.917
'CAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.650
I'VE ALREADY GOT
LENNOX AND RYDER.

15:21.651 --> 15:23.652
YEAH?

15:23.653 --> 15:26.425
YOU'D BE OKAY WITH NEVER
HAVING KIDS OF YOUR OWN?

15:26.426 --> 15:30.159
YOU KNOW MAYBE WHAT'S A
DEAL BREAKER IN YOUR 20s

15:30.160 --> 15:32.701
ISN'T A DEAL BREAKER
IN YOUR 30S.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.663
MAYBE THAT'S GROWING UP.

15:34.664 --> 15:35.605
BURKE, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING

15:35.606 --> 15:37.337
AND I MEAN EVERY WORD OF IT.

15:39.469 --> 15:41.470
YOU GOT TO GET WHAT
YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

15:41.471 --> 15:43.212
AND YOU SHOULD NEVER COMPROMISE,

15:43.213 --> 15:45.144
NOT ON THE BIG THINGS.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.616
I'M NOT COMPROMISING.

15:47.617 --> 15:52.381
YOU KNOW, I'M AN
AWESOME AUNT/MOM

15:52.382 --> 15:57.656
WHO HAPPENS TO BE VERY
FLINTY AND PULCHRITUDINOUS.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.528
IF I PARTIED LESS IN COLLEGE,

15:59.529 --> 16:01.191
I MIGHT REMEMBER WHAT
THOSE WORDS MEAN.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.666
HEY, YOU, GET YOUR
ESSAY-WRITING BUTT UPSTAIRS.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.238
I FINISHED MY ESSAY.

16:09.239 --> 16:10.439
YOU'RE FIRED.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.741
BUT I LOVE MY JOB.

16:12.742 --> 16:15.044
YELLING AT YOU IS SO FULFILLING.

16:15.045 --> 16:18.007
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SURE
AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER,

16:18.008 --> 16:19.448
I WILL HAVE A HUGE PAPER DUE

16:19.449 --> 16:22.051
AND YOU WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON I CALL TO HARASS ME.

16:22.052 --> 16:24.583
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.256
- HEY, YOU KNOW IT WAS GREAT WORKING WITH YOU.
- YEAH.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.419
YEAH, I'M ALL PACKED
AND READY TO GO.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.560
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

16:31.561 --> 16:33.622
( kissing )

16:33.623 --> 16:36.225
PHONE KISSING AT YOUR AGE?

16:36.226 --> 16:38.427
YOU SOUND RIDICULOUS.

16:38.428 --> 16:40.429
YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE IN LOVE
GET TO BE RIDICULOUS.

16:40.430 --> 16:41.470
THAT'S ONE OF THE PERKS.

16:41.471 --> 16:44.473
AUSTIN FOUND THE CUTEST
BED AND BREAKFAST.

16:44.474 --> 16:47.106
OH, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN AN
OLD-FASHIONED ROMANCE MOVIE.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.738
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING
MY DORIS DAY DRESS.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.380
WHAT'S DORIS DAY?

16:51.381 --> 16:53.213
OH, IS THAT A FAKE
HOLIDAY LIKE ARBOR DAY?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.546
- HELLO, LADIES.
- Lennox: HEY.

16:57.547 --> 16:59.518
MAN, THAT BABY IS FAT.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.649
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I JUST DON'T SEE

17:00.650 --> 17:03.252
THE APPEAL OF THOSE THINGS.

17:03.253 --> 17:05.694
GOOD. DON'T THINK ABOUT HAVING
ONE FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS.

17:05.695 --> 17:07.756
BUCHWALDS' SITTER
QUIT ON THEM AGAIN.

17:07.757 --> 17:09.098
SO I TOLD THEM THAT I'D WATCH

17:09.099 --> 17:10.699
BABY TUCKER HERE FOR
A COUPLE HOURS.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.061
- HE'S...
- ( baby cries )

17:12.062 --> 17:13.332
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE
KEEPS DOING THAT THING.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.505
NOW HE'S RED AND
BUBBLING AT THE MOUTH.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.807
OH, MAKE HIM STOP. IT'S TORTURE.

17:18.808 --> 17:21.170
- ( cries continue )
- OH, HERE WE GO, PAL.

17:21.171 --> 17:22.711
HERE, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ANYTHING.

17:22.712 --> 17:23.573
- GIVE HIM.
- I DO KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

17:23.574 --> 17:24.813
- GIVE ME HIM.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

17:24.814 --> 17:27.316
- BE MY GUEST. GO AHEAD.
- HEY, IT'S OKAY.

17:27.317 --> 17:29.678
DID THE MEAN, OLD,
MUSCLEY MAN SCARE YOU?

17:29.679 --> 17:33.582
LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE A
BIG BOY, AREN'T YOU?

17:33.583 --> 17:35.524
OH, YOU'RE SUCH A BIG BOY.

17:35.525 --> 17:37.126
- OH, YOU'RE SUCH A BIG BOY.
- ( coos )

17:37.127 --> 17:38.127
BURKE, YOU'RE A NATURAL.

17:38.128 --> 17:39.788
( kisses )

17:39.789 --> 17:41.660
YEAH, YOU FOUND THE OFF SWITCH.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.662
HE'S STILL FAT.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.465
YOU NEED TO GET THAT
BABY ON A STAIRMASTER.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.698
NO, I DON'T NEED ONE OF THESE
TO MAKE MY LIFE COMPLETE.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.340
NO, I DON'T.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.071
NO, I DON'T. NO, I DON'T.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.843
I SURE, SURE DON'T. NO, I DON'T.

17:54.844 --> 17:57.106
HEY, SWEETHEART. READY TO GO?

17:57.107 --> 17:58.447
HEY, AUSTIN.

17:58.448 --> 18:01.150
JOE JUST CAME OVER WITH
THE NEIGHBOR'S BABY.

18:01.151 --> 18:02.351
GUESS I'LL GO FEED HIM.

18:02.352 --> 18:03.582
THAT WAY HE WON'T TRY
TO NURSE ON YOU.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.515
YEAH, THESE ARE
FOR DISPLAY ONLY.

18:09.159 --> 18:10.659
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE
THIS B&B, MEL.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.461
I GOT US A ROOM WITH A HOT TUB,

18:12.462 --> 18:14.823
FIREPLACE, AND AN
AMAZING VIEW OF YOU.

18:14.824 --> 18:16.725
WELL, THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL,

18:16.726 --> 18:20.329
WONDERFUL, FANTASTIC AND...

18:20.330 --> 18:21.500
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.672
I SWEAR THEY COMPLETELY

18:23.673 --> 18:25.404
DISINFECT THE HOT
TUB BETWEEN GUESTS.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.636
NO, NO, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE HOT TUB.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.608
IF I GO AWAY WITH
YOU THIS WEEKEND,

18:29.609 --> 18:32.181
I'M JUST GONNA FALL FOR
YOU DEEPER AND DEEPER.

18:32.182 --> 18:33.582
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.384
YEAH, BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

18:35.385 --> 18:36.745
I'D BE TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

18:36.746 --> 18:39.188
AND THEN I'D START ACTING CRAZY
AND USING APPS LIKE THIS

18:39.189 --> 18:40.650
TO SEE WHAT OUR BABY
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

18:42.692 --> 18:45.724
MEL, I HAVEN'T CHANGED MY MIND.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.756
HAVING KIDS IS A
DEAL BREAKER FOR ME.

18:47.757 --> 18:49.628
I KNOW.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.760
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU

18:51.761 --> 18:55.804
AND HONEST TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

18:55.805 --> 18:57.336
AT SOME POINT IN MY LIFE,

18:57.337 --> 19:00.240
I'M GONNA WANT MY OWN
LITTLE DEAL BREAKER.

19:02.172 --> 19:03.542
I'M SORRY, AUSTIN.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.914
SO AM I.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.822
HEY.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.454
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

19:15.455 --> 19:18.156
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT, JOE,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.329
YOU KNOW, ABOUT ME
BEING IN DENIAL.

19:20.330 --> 19:22.291
JUST TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO REALIZE IT,

19:22.292 --> 19:25.163
DUE IN LARGE PART TO
THE DENIAL THING.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.367
WELL, SOMETIMES WE ALL
HAVE BLINDERS ON...

19:28.368 --> 19:30.699
OR BLINDFOLDS...

19:30.700 --> 19:32.341
OR HANDCUFFS.

19:32.342 --> 19:35.544
YOU KNOW, JUST TO SORT
OF MIX THINGS UP.

19:35.545 --> 19:37.606
ANYWAY, UM...

19:37.607 --> 19:39.478
I JUST THINK YOU NEED
TO FIND SOMEBODY

19:39.479 --> 19:40.649
THAT'S ON THE SAME PAGE AS YOU

19:40.650 --> 19:42.751
OR AT LEAST IN THE
SAME BOOK AS YOU.

19:42.752 --> 19:46.515
AND I'M GUESSING CHARDONNAY
IS NOT A BIG READER.

19:46.516 --> 19:49.318
SHE'S NOT SO MUCH BOOK SMART

19:49.319 --> 19:52.591
AS SHE IS... MAGAZINE SMART.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.664
AND I THINK SHE DEFINITELY

19:55.665 --> 19:57.326
CANCELED HER SUBSCRIPTION TO ME.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.798
IT'S PROBABLY FOR
THE BEST THOUGH.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.471
I ACTUALLY THINK I'M READY
TO HANG OUT WITH SOMEONE

20:02.472 --> 20:03.902
A LITTLE MORE MATURE,

20:03.903 --> 20:08.477
SOMEONE I CAN SETTLE DOWN WITH
AND START A FAMILY SOME DAY.

20:08.478 --> 20:10.479
REALLY, JOE? YOU WANT KIDS?

20:10.480 --> 20:12.210
ABSOLUTELY.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.942
A COUPLE OR...

20:13.943 --> 20:16.345
EIGHT.

20:16.346 --> 20:17.716
I JUST NEED TO BE PATIENT

20:17.717 --> 20:19.948
AND I'LL FIND THE RIGHT PERSON.

20:19.949 --> 20:21.420
YEAH, YOU'LL FIND
HER EVENTUALLY.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.851
I'M NOT GONNA STOP
DATING UNTIL I DO.

20:22.852 --> 20:27.426
I WILL LEAVE NO...
HOT WOMAN UNTURNED.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.430
SOLDIER ON, LONGO. SOLDIER ON.

20:37.367 --> 20:38.667
HEY.

20:38.668 --> 20:41.270
HEY, NICE MOVE.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.441
WHAT?

20:42.442 --> 20:44.743
BRINGING IN THAT BABY.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.376
UH, THAT WASN'T A MOVE.
I WAS BABYSITTING.

20:47.377 --> 20:49.318
RIGHT. YEAH.

20:49.319 --> 20:50.779
THE BUCHWALDS NEEDED
YOU TO BABYSIT

20:50.780 --> 20:52.781
AT THE EXACT MOMENT
AUNT MEL NEEDED HELP

20:52.782 --> 20:54.383
TO REALIZE WHAT SHE
WANTED IN LIFE.

20:54.384 --> 20:55.954
IT'S FUNNY HOW THAT WORKED OUT.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.387
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT
HER, DON'T YOU, JOE?

20:58.388 --> 21:01.461
YEAH, OF COURSE I
CARE ABOUT HER.

21:02.532 --> 21:04.633
LIKE I CARE ABOUT ALL YOU GUYS.

21:04.634 --> 21:06.835
THAT'S... THAT'S MY JOB.

21:06.836 --> 21:10.399
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE ONLY PAID
TO LOOK AFTER RYDER AND ME.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.970
CARING ABOUT AUNT
MEL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

21:11.971 --> 21:13.672
SOMETHING YOU DO
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO.

21:13.673 --> 21:17.976
THERE'S REALLY SO MUCH YOU
DON'T KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.381
THERE'S REALLY SO MUCH YOU
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
