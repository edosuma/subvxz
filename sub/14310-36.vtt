00:06.190 --> 00:09.220
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.000 --> 00:13.130
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:13.150 --> 00:16.120
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.050
They were good.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.079
[music continues]

00:23.199 --> 00:27.199
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:27.219 --> 00:29.050
He was bad.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.119
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:32.140 --> 00:35.090
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:35.109 --> 00:37.189
if it's the last
thing I ever do!

00:37.210 --> 00:39.179
[evil laugh]

00:39.200 --> 00:41.020
[Gargamel grunts]

00:41.039 --> 00:42.219
Oh, I'll get you.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.039
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:46.060 --> 00:48.119
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:48.140 --> 00:52.159
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:52.179 --> 00:55.149
And if you are good
you may just catch

00:55.170 --> 00:58.100
a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:01.049 --> 01:02.200
[theme music]

01:12.069 --> 01:14.069
[grunting]

01:14.090 --> 01:16.030
[panting]

01:28.150 --> 01:29.230
[panting]

01:30.010 --> 01:32.159
- Hi, Farmer Smurf.
- Hello, Handy.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.039
Say, I just finished my chores.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.009
So how about
a game of smurfball?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.159
Can't. Have to mow these weeds.

01:40.180 --> 01:43.079
And they be driving me smurfy!

01:43.099 --> 01:46.060
[grunting]

01:46.079 --> 01:48.150
Hey, Jokey.
Join me for a swim?

01:48.170 --> 01:53.109
Swim? Ha-ha-ha!
I have to cut all this firewood.

01:56.030 --> 01:58.210
And that's no joke.

01:58.229 --> 02:01.000
Greedy Smurf,
how would you like to..

02:01.019 --> 02:03.040
Sorry, Handy.
I'm too busy.

02:05.159 --> 02:09.038
- Uh, what's smurfing, Handy?
- Forget it.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.090
If only there was a faster way
for us Smurfs

02:11.110 --> 02:13.169
to get our work done.

02:13.189 --> 02:15.219
I know! I'll invent a way.

02:17.030 --> 02:19.180
[indistinct chatter]

02:19.199 --> 02:21.210
Why all the excitement,
Smurfette?

02:21.229 --> 02:25.020
Ooh, Handy's fixing
a surprise for us.

02:25.039 --> 02:27.079
I hate surprises.

02:27.099 --> 02:30.009
(Handy)
'Attention, Smurfs.'

02:30.030 --> 02:31.170
You see before you
an invention

02:31.189 --> 02:35.139
to take all the work
out of work.

02:35.159 --> 02:38.159
- A Clockwork Smurf.
- Huh?

02:38.180 --> 02:40.129
Just set
Clockwork Smurf's button

02:40.150 --> 02:42.180
for whatever kind of work
you have to do.

02:42.199 --> 02:45.120
And Clockwork Smurf
will do it for you.

02:45.139 --> 02:48.079
[Clockwork sputtering]

02:48.099 --> 02:50.030
[Smurfs gasping]

02:57.079 --> 03:00.120
(Farmer Smurf)
'That contraption be
as strong as a hundred Smurfs.'

03:00.139 --> 03:03.060
Handy, old pal,
can I use him next?

03:03.080 --> 03:05.009
No, I have him next.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.060
[clamoring]

03:07.080 --> 03:08.110
Hold it. Hold it.

03:08.129 --> 03:10.139
I want Papa Smurf
to have the honor

03:10.159 --> 03:12.039
of using him first.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.020
Why, thank you, Handy.

03:14.039 --> 03:16.159
I do have a little kink
in my back.

03:16.180 --> 03:19.009
Perhaps a gentle massage?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.139
A little to the right. Ha-ha.

03:22.159 --> 03:26.159
A little to the left. Ha-ha.
Ah, right there.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.110
[instrumental music]

03:30.120 --> 03:32.020
[sighs]

03:36.050 --> 03:38.090
I feel like a new Smurf.

03:38.110 --> 03:39.129
Next.

03:39.150 --> 03:41.229
[Clockwork sputters]

03:42.009 --> 03:45.110
Uh, just a pinch less sugar in
the next batch, Clockwork Smurf.

03:45.129 --> 03:48.170
[chuckles]
I have to watch
the old smurfline, you know.

03:51.219 --> 03:56.079
Oh, Clockwork Smurf.
You can do so many things.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.189
I hate doing things

04:00.210 --> 04:03.080
that the Clockwork Smurf
can do better.

04:05.039 --> 04:08.050
I wonder what
makes this thing tick.

04:08.069 --> 04:10.050
I'll just sneak a peek.

04:13.009 --> 04:14.080
Oops!

04:14.099 --> 04:16.220
[sputtering]

04:19.180 --> 04:22.220
Clockwork Smurf!
Where are you?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.139
Uh-oh.

04:27.029 --> 04:28.230
[whistling]

04:29.009 --> 04:32.180

Oh, there you are.

05:17.110 --> 05:20.110
I don't understand.
Where did I go wrong?

05:20.129 --> 05:23.180
I don't know, but you must
put things right again

05:23.199 --> 05:26.120
before the whole village
is destroyed.

05:31.019 --> 05:32.149

05:44.090 --> 05:47.069
I'm afraid we'll have to use
force to stop him.

Poor Clockwork.

06:04.120 --> 06:09.199
Sorry, Smurf. This is gonna
hurt me more than it hurts you.

06:10.220 --> 06:12.230
[whirring]

06:16.149 --> 06:20.019
My most brilliant creation,
a failure.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.149
- What could have gone wrong?
- It wasn't your fault, Handy.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.189
You smurfed your best.

'I can hardly wait.'

07:31.220 --> 07:35.129
Tomorrow is Prince Gerard's
12th birthday.

07:35.149 --> 07:38.120
The day he officially
becomes our new king.

07:38.139 --> 07:41.129
It excites me
to no end, Mrs. Sourberry.

07:41.149 --> 07:45.220
A pity the poor little fellow
has been so ill for so long.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.060
Oh, yes,
but he will be well enough

07:48.079 --> 07:50.180
'to attend his coronation,
won't he?'

07:50.199 --> 07:54.040
Mrs. Sourberry,
we can only pray.

07:54.060 --> 07:59.050
Oh, how sad. But some warm food
is just what he needs. So I'll--

07:59.069 --> 08:01.220
Oh, he's still much
too sick for visitors.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.129
But I shall see
that he eats every drop.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.189
Oh, thank you, milady.

08:06.209 --> 08:10.170
Oh, little tyke,
he's been sick for so long.

08:10.189 --> 08:13.149
Everything is going
according to plan.

I, Imperia, shall be queen.'

of disgusting gruel'

little prince as usual.

08:38.070 --> 08:40.179

Yes, milady.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.200
And at midnight,
when everyone's asleep

08:42.220 --> 08:46.090
'we will sneak the brat to the
secret dungeon under the moat.'

08:46.110 --> 08:50.039
Tomorrow, we will announce
that his three years of illness

08:50.059 --> 08:53.000
have come to a final,
tragic end.

08:53.019 --> 08:58.000
Then, as the law decrees,
I shall be crowned queen.

08:58.019 --> 08:59.149
[laughs maniacally]

09:01.090 --> 09:03.000

Good evening,
Your Royal Lowness.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.019
[chuckling]

09:08.039 --> 09:10.039
I bring you glad tidings.

09:10.059 --> 09:12.190
'At midnight,
we're moving you to chambers'

09:12.210 --> 09:15.059
'more befitting a young king.'

09:15.080 --> 09:16.230
- Really?
- Yes.

09:17.009 --> 09:20.190
A place without
such drafty windows.

09:20.210 --> 09:23.230
In fact, with no windows at all.

09:24.009 --> 09:25.159
[laughing]

09:25.179 --> 09:27.009
[snarling]

09:28.210 --> 09:32.120
Go ahead and laugh, Ulrich.
I shall have my day.

09:32.139 --> 09:36.100
Oh, you'll have many, many days.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.190
All spent in the dungeon.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.149
[laughing]

09:40.169 --> 09:44.159
- Ah!
- Enjoy your coronation feast.

09:44.179 --> 09:46.090

What am I to do?

[Clockwork sputters]

put a snake in my gruel?

09:54.179 --> 09:57.059
[coughing]

10:03.139 --> 10:06.019
Well, what a clever
little doll.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.120
I don't know how you got here,
but you're stuck with me now

10:10.139 --> 10:12.080
feeding the rats.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.190
[sputtering]

10:16.000 --> 10:18.200
Huh? What are you
trying to tell me?

you're a genius.

slam

10:40.139 --> 10:41.190
[intense music]

10:41.210 --> 10:44.139
We must find someone
we can trust.

10:44.159 --> 10:47.129
And tell them the truth
about Lady Imperia.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.129
Dear Mrs. Sourberry.

10:52.149 --> 10:56.039
Oh, am I glad to see you
after all these years.

10:56.059 --> 10:59.200
Who are you, child, and how
did you get into this castle?

10:59.220 --> 11:03.039
'Tis I, Prince Gerard.
Remember?

11:03.059 --> 11:06.159
Sure, and I suppose
those rags you're wearing

11:06.179 --> 11:09.029
are the latest royal fashion.

11:09.049 --> 11:10.220
But let me explain.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.039
Here, young man.
Take these cookies and be gone.

11:15.059 --> 11:16.220
(Gerard)
'But-but I can--'

11:17.000 --> 11:20.159
You'd best trot yourself home
before the guards spot you.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.019
And don't sneak in here again.

11:23.039 --> 11:26.179
(Gerard)
But.. Oh, it's no use.

11:26.200 --> 11:30.019
Who in the world would believe
a ragamuffin like me

11:30.039 --> 11:31.149
could be a prince?

11:31.169 --> 11:34.090
If only I could
find some friends.

11:44.169 --> 11:47.230
Prince Gerard
to his new royal chamber.

11:48.009 --> 11:49.159
[Ulrich laughing]

11:49.179 --> 11:54.019
Alright, you little laggard,
time to.. What?

11:54.039 --> 11:56.049
'He-he's gone!'

11:59.190 --> 12:05.000
Mrs. Sourberry. A terrible
catastrophe has befallen us.

12:05.019 --> 12:08.110
- The poor, sick prince is gone.
- Gone?

12:08.129 --> 12:11.200
Yes, escaped.
I-I-I mean, wandered off.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.100
'The fever must
have affected his mind.'

12:14.120 --> 12:16.039
Oh, no!

12:16.059 --> 12:17.149
[crying]

12:17.169 --> 12:19.169
You haven't perchance
seen any trace of the brat?

12:19.190 --> 12:22.070
I-I-I.. My beloved nephew.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.080
Oh, no, milady.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.159
The only soul
I've seen all night

12:26.179 --> 12:28.190
was a poor little peasant boy

12:28.210 --> 12:32.230
babbling some nonsense
about being a prince.

12:33.009 --> 12:35.070
- Huh!
- That was he!

12:35.090 --> 12:37.179
Oh, the poor dear is so ill

12:37.200 --> 12:39.159
he sometimes thinks
he's a peasant

12:39.179 --> 12:41.200
and, uh, dresses accordingly.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.110
Which way did he go?

12:43.129 --> 12:48.090
I saw him heading for the forest
with a strange little toy doll.

12:48.110 --> 12:53.200
A doll? I told you
he was to have no toys.

12:53.220 --> 12:57.000
Uh, well, we'd better go
and find my dear nephew

12:57.019 --> 13:00.110
and see that
he's properly taken care of.

13:02.139 --> 13:04.230
After we catch that rat,
we'll lock him in a prison

13:05.009 --> 13:06.110
from which
he'll never escape.

13:06.129 --> 13:10.019
And then we'll throw
his little doll to the fire.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.179
[laughing maniacally]

13:14.029 --> 13:16.179

[intense music]

13:19.190 --> 13:22.080
[snarling]

13:23.220 --> 13:26.220
It's the prince.
Fang's picked up the scent.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.200
Excellent,
that little brat Gerard

13:29.220 --> 13:32.049
will soon be
locked up again. Ha!

13:32.070 --> 13:35.009
Hyah! Hyah! Giddyap now. Ha!

[Fang barking in distance]

13:41.029 --> 13:44.179

They're after us.
We'll never outrun them.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.230

13:46.009 --> 13:48.129
Perhaps we should
face them like men.

13:48.149 --> 13:50.100
If only we were men.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.000
[sputtering]

13:54.149 --> 13:56.210
You want to cross that river?

13:56.230 --> 13:58.100
You must be daft.

[gibberish]

13:59.149 --> 14:00.139
[Fang barking in distance]

14:00.159 --> 14:02.070
Hang on, little friend

14:02.090 --> 14:05.059

(Ulrich)
I'm afraid Fang
has lost the scent, milady.

14:14.179 --> 14:17.110
(Imperia)
Then he will just have
to find it again.

14:17.129 --> 14:18.210
Across the river!

14:20.090 --> 14:23.059
I just don't get it.
What could have gone wrong?

14:23.080 --> 14:27.009
My poor Clockwork Smurf,
lying out there broken.

14:27.029 --> 14:30.080
By smurf, I'm gonna get him
on his feet again.

14:31.179 --> 14:33.220

14:46.230 --> 14:50.090
Please don't be afraid.
We mean you no harm.

14:50.110 --> 14:52.059
Who are you,
a-and what do you want?

14:52.080 --> 14:56.129
I-I may not look it,
but I am a prince.

14:56.149 --> 14:57.190
Prince Gerard.

'Tomorrow should be
my coronation day as king.'

'But my evil aunt, Lady Imperia'

the crown for herself.

15:08.179 --> 15:10.070
Thanks to your
Clockwork Smurf

15:10.090 --> 15:13.129
I escaped the prison tower
in which she's been keeping me.

15:13.149 --> 15:16.029
But unless we stop Imperia
and her henchmen

15:16.049 --> 15:17.110
before it's too late

15:17.129 --> 15:20.190

and I will be doomed.'

'Your Majesty, my Smurfs and I'

15:31.059 --> 15:34.000

to help you in any way we can.

15:34.019 --> 15:37.019
Yeah. We'll give them a right,
and we'll give them a left.

[clamoring]

15:40.009 --> 15:41.159
Hold it, Smurfs, hold it.

15:41.179 --> 15:45.149
First, how about a nice bath
and some clean clothes, prince?

15:45.169 --> 15:49.080
Oh, thank you.
And something to eat?

15:49.100 --> 15:51.120
Now you're talking, prince.

15:51.139 --> 15:54.200
[chuckles]
I could use a little
midnight snack myself.

Follow me.

15:56.139 --> 15:59.029
[indistinct chatter]

16:01.090 --> 16:03.100
I, uh, uh, just wanted to say

16:03.120 --> 16:07.100
what you've done
for the prince is really smurfy.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.169
[gibberish]

16:08.190 --> 16:13.059
A real father
couldn't be more proud.

We'll keep
the home fires burning

16:30.179 --> 16:32.220

Eh, gents?

Splendid,
with this brush cleared

16:37.200 --> 16:40.159
no one'll be able to pass
this way without being seen.

16:40.179 --> 16:44.139
Now I must return to the castle
to prepare for my coronation.

16:44.159 --> 16:46.139
When you catch
the little scoundrel

16:46.159 --> 16:48.139
you know what to do with him.

he's no longer a prince.

I not only feel like a king

17:35.140 --> 17:37.029

Then it's time
you return to your kingdom

to claim your crown.
