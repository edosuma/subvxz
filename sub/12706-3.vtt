WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.471
* Until I get the nerve

00:03.504 --> 00:08.375
* To sound what we believe

00:08.409 --> 00:12.580
* When I see your face

00:12.612 --> 00:16.250
* My eyes just dilate

00:16.283 --> 00:19.253
(indistinct chatter)
* But I can't erase

00:20.553 --> 00:24.358
* That I want to violate...

00:24.391 --> 00:26.359
Hey, look,
Parker's here.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.695
Yeah?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.196
You're not looking?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.364
He looks really cute
in green.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.700
Teal.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.368
He's reflected
in the mirror.

00:37.537 --> 00:41.008
You know, when you spend
all week with a boy,

00:41.040 --> 00:43.042
you are allowed to
look at him directly.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.012
Not all week.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.348
We hung out
moderately incessantly,

00:48.381 --> 00:50.218
but we're not here
together tonight.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.018
You know, I don't
want to crowd him.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.255
(applause and cheering)

01:00.761 --> 01:03.097
Hey. You guys ready
to load up and go?

01:03.131 --> 01:04.730
Almost.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.534
Buffy's looking at Parker,

01:06.567 --> 01:10.204
who, it turns out, has a
reflection, so, big plus there.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.406
Buffy's having lusty
wrong feelings.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.942
No, I'm not.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.043
No, you're not.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.778
Oh, I so am.

01:18.811 --> 01:22.783
No, they're not wrong feelings,
'cause there's no wrong.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.385
You're free, you're
both grown-ups.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.855
You are free, right?

01:29.088 --> 01:30.724
Hi.
Hi.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.561
I... I just wanted to let you
know I'm heading out.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.795
And it's not real safe
around here, so, if you,

01:35.829 --> 01:37.397
you know, walk back
to your dorm...

01:37.430 --> 01:40.768
How silly of me not
to plan ahead.

01:46.939 --> 01:48.475
Bye.
PARKER:
See you guys.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.078
* Every time you're near

01:51.110 --> 01:54.281
* I'll keep you safe
from harm... *

01:54.314 --> 01:55.748
(distant siren blaring)

01:55.783 --> 01:57.651
That was, like,
the best set ever.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.186
We'll do great in L.A.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.087
We're gonna have them
glued to their seats.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.355
Uh, Devon?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.090
Aren't they
supposed to dance?

02:04.123 --> 02:06.527
Well, we can glue 'em
to the dance floor.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.598
I don't mean
with real glue.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.000
You got that, right?

02:13.032 --> 02:15.203
I got that.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.538
HARMONY:
Willow?

02:17.570 --> 02:20.274
WILLOW:
Harmony, hey.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.942
Hey, I haven't seen you since...

02:21.974 --> 02:23.644
Since graduation.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.646
Big snake, huh?
Yeah.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.382
So how was your summer vacation?

02:28.415 --> 02:31.185
Oh, well, I was gonna go
to France, but I didn't.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.152
I was dying to
see the stores.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.323
Oh, and museums.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.156
Museums?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.126
Yeah, I heard they had 'em.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.295
You know, just a rumor
you pick up on the streets.
(laughing)

02:41.329 --> 02:43.129
Right. You're always so funny,
Willow.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.632
You haven't changed a bit.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.667
No, you, neither.

02:46.699 --> 02:49.102
Oh... maybe a little.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.872
(gasps)
(growls)

02:52.906 --> 02:54.942
(yelps)

02:56.877 --> 03:00.013
(wolf howling)

03:00.046 --> 03:02.250
*

03:50.298 --> 03:54.301
(growling, grunting)

03:54.335 --> 03:55.902
Back off, Harmony!
(growling)

03:55.936 --> 03:58.639
Okay, fine.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.308
Hide behind your boyfriend,
but guess what?

04:01.342 --> 04:04.312
I have a boyfriend, too,
and he's gonna be mad that

04:04.344 --> 04:06.013
you were mean to me.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.453
BUFFY:
Hobbies?

04:12.485 --> 04:15.087
Yeah, hobbies, interests.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.658
I feel like there's so much
I still don't know about you.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.327
What do you like to do?

04:20.360 --> 04:27.468
Well, mostly I... hang
out and... do stuff.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.672
Yeah, I was into that
for a while.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.574
What's that?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.242
What's what?

04:35.274 --> 04:37.076
You have a scar.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.848
Right. Um...

04:40.880 --> 04:43.016
Angry puppy.

04:44.851 --> 04:48.689
So, do I get to see
any of your scars?

04:48.721 --> 04:50.858
(laughs) Oh.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.761
Oh, mine are all psychological.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.896
Oh, please. Those
are the best kind.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.800
Well, my father
died last year.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.704
Oh, God. Parker,
I'm sorry.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.706
I didn't mean to
bring up that stuff.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.708
Oh, bad, bad Buffy.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.711
No. No, I'm okay
to talk about it now.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.547
And I'm not doing the deep,
get-sympathy routine.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.384
I mean, don't you just
hate guys who are all

05:16.417 --> 05:20.353
"I'm dark and brooding,
so give me love."?

05:20.387 --> 05:22.755
I don't think I've
ever met that type.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.533
I just wanted to say that

05:33.567 --> 05:38.538
what made it so sad was that
there was, oh, a lot of stuff

05:38.572 --> 05:40.139
he didn't get to finish.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.475
It made me think about...

05:42.509 --> 05:44.211
(laughs)

05:44.244 --> 05:47.781
you know... living for now.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.187
I think about that sometimes.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.557
Yeah, I sort of...

05:57.591 --> 05:59.992
drowned a couple years ago,

06:00.026 --> 06:03.596
but I came back, obviously.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.767
But I don't... I don't
put stuff off anymore,

06:07.800 --> 06:09.769
like you were saying.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.771
That's great.

06:11.805 --> 06:15.375
I mean, everybody
says they get it.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.343
"Oh, man, me, too.
Live for today."

06:17.377 --> 06:19.612
But what they really want
is an excuse to goof off

06:19.646 --> 06:21.014
and not study for finals.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.016
Also a valid life choice.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.584
(laughs)

06:26.052 --> 06:28.422
It's cool to
find someone else

06:28.456 --> 06:30.757
who understands.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.896
So, Parker Abrams,
when you go to sleep tonight,

06:35.928 --> 06:38.499
what are you gonna regret
not doing today?

06:39.932 --> 06:44.036
I am going to regret
being too nervous

06:44.071 --> 06:48.341
to ask you to go to the party
at Wolf House tomorrow night.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.646
Do you want to go
to the party...?
Yes.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.788
XANDER:
 I'm not enjoying this.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.790
Well, shelve them correctly,
and we can finish.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.824
I don't get your
crazy system.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.194
My system? It's
called the alphabet.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.564
Huh. Would you look at that.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.166
(door opens)

07:16.435 --> 07:19.005
You should lock your door.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.475
Believe me, I am kicking myself.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.110
XANDER:
Anya?

07:23.143 --> 07:26.779
Last time I saw you,
fleeing in terror.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.949
How'd that work out for you?

07:28.981 --> 07:30.651
I need to talk to Xander.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.855
Go away.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.562
Xander, come with me.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.800
Your mother said you
were working here?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.636
Yeah. Yeah,
need some money, and...

07:48.668 --> 07:51.170
So, where is our
relationship going?

07:51.204 --> 07:54.307
Our what? Our who?

07:54.341 --> 07:56.442
Relationship. What
kind do we have,

07:56.475 --> 07:58.045
and what is it
progressing toward?

07:58.077 --> 08:00.447
I...

08:00.480 --> 08:02.783
Uh, we have a relationship?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.617
We went to the prom.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.689
Yeah. On our one and only date.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.024
Second date called on account
of snake, remember?

08:12.059 --> 08:14.827
And there's the whole you used
to be a man-killing demon thing,

08:14.862 --> 08:19.365
which to be fair, is as much
my issue as it is yours.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.168
I can't stop thinking about you.

08:22.201 --> 08:25.572
Sometimes, in my dreams,
you're all naked.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.206
Really? (laughs)

08:27.240 --> 08:29.543
You know, if I'm in the checkout
line at the Wal-Mart,

08:29.576 --> 08:32.345
I've had that same one.
So,

08:32.379 --> 08:34.748
I can assume a standing
Friday night date

08:34.782 --> 08:36.750
and a mutual recognition
of prom night

08:36.783 --> 08:39.586
as our dating
anniversary?
Anya, slow down.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.721
In fact, come
to a screeching halt.

08:41.754 --> 08:45.692
See, these things kind of have
to develop on their own.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.595
All right. How?

08:47.628 --> 08:52.532
I don't know.
It just... happens.

08:56.870 --> 09:01.008
This is it.
My door. Wood.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.677
Maybe some kind
of wood veneer.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.712
It's nice.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.085
OZ:
Hey.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.955
Hi. Hi. Uh,
remember Harmony?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.789
She's back
from her summer vacation,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.859
and she's a little different.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.293
Different?

09:20.326 --> 09:23.263
Paler?
Is your neck okay?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.398
Neck. Paler.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.100
Puppy. The angry puppy.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.570
Yeah, we came to warn you
about the... angry puppy.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.806
Uh, uh, I'm...

09:32.840 --> 09:34.774
should really take care
of this now.
Oh.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.543
I'll pick you up tomorrow
night for the party?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.110
I can't wait.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.015
Band-Aid, now.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.886
Thank you.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.222
BUFFY:
Harmony's a vampire?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.325
She must be dying
without a reflection.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.662
She just made me so mad.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.996
"My boyfriend's
gonna beat you up."

09:57.029 --> 09:58.264
My boyfriend?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.832
Well, I mean,
if you believe her.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.735
She always lied
about stuff like that.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.403
"Oh, he goes
to another school.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.172
You wouldn't know him."

10:05.205 --> 10:08.140
Uh, Devon dated her for a while,
but she was too flaky for him

10:08.174 --> 10:11.177
which, stop and marvel
at the concept.
(laughs)

10:11.211 --> 10:13.647
Guy dating Harmony dead.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.750
Must be, like, the most tolerant
guy in the world.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.186
(drilling)

10:25.357 --> 10:28.061
Hi, baby. I'm back.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.506
(indistinct chatter,
dog barking)

10:47.080 --> 10:48.948
(drilling)

10:48.981 --> 10:50.884
It's definitely
the crypt, Ryan?

10:50.918 --> 10:53.019
I'm not keen on tunneling
into someone's septic tank.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.822
It's the crypt.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.655
The radar soundings are clear.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.826
Uh, the walls are thinnest
here at the bottom.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.794
We have to tunnel
from underneath.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.032
More work, but, uh,
I'm sure that you...

11:05.065 --> 11:06.298
(grunts, whimpering)

11:06.332 --> 11:09.201
You'd better be
more than sure, mate,

11:09.235 --> 11:11.739
'cause I'd hate
to have to hurt you.
I

11:11.772 --> 11:13.539
swear. I swear.

11:13.572 --> 11:17.076
How's my little
Blondie Bear?

11:17.110 --> 11:20.047
Harm, does this look
like a good time to talk?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.315
Are you gonna
kill Willow today?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.884
'Cause I want you to say,

11:23.917 --> 11:25.753
"This is for messing
with my sweet girl."

11:25.786 --> 11:27.754
And then... you know...

11:27.788 --> 11:30.423
(sucking)

11:30.456 --> 11:32.860
(gasps, panting)

11:34.061 --> 11:36.062
Nobody knows I'm here.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.931
Now, I'm not killing
the slayer's best friend,

11:37.965 --> 11:39.599
as that would
tend to announce

11:39.631 --> 11:41.902
my presence, and
we're too bloody close.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.437
You almost killed her last year.
Suddenly it's a big deal?

11:44.471 --> 11:46.673
Sod off! Hmm?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.741
Go eat something.
I've got work to do.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.780
(sighs)

11:55.715 --> 11:58.051
(soft groaning)
This one tastes funny.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.451
Take me out to eat.

11:59.485 --> 12:00.921
He's perfectly fresh.

12:00.953 --> 12:02.755
(soft groaning)

12:02.789 --> 12:05.692
I think I had a math class
with him last year, and I didn't

12:05.725 --> 12:07.726
like him that
much then, either.
Harm!

12:07.760 --> 12:09.296
I want to go to a party!

12:09.328 --> 12:11.230
(stomps his foot)

12:11.264 --> 12:13.732
(grunts loudly)

12:13.767 --> 12:17.136
Ooh. Right here, baby?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.971
In front of Ryan?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.607
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.744
Maybe I would.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.479
After a party.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.817
(laughing)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.886
Tonight...

12:33.921 --> 12:35.956
I'll take you somewhere nice.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.163
* I stand in the pouring rain

12:43.196 --> 12:46.066
* You couldn't even be there
to pick me up *

12:46.099 --> 12:48.434
* Taking me
for granted again *

12:48.467 --> 12:51.138
* You're running out of time
and you're out of luck *

12:51.171 --> 12:55.174
* Just a moment of weakness...

12:55.207 --> 12:57.977
This is some party, huh?
The last days of Rome.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.148
It's better.
No old Romans.
(laughs)

13:01.181 --> 13:02.950
(glass breaking, men groaning)

13:02.982 --> 13:04.451
You want to dance?

13:04.484 --> 13:07.720
No! Let's have
a meaningful talk instead.

13:09.822 --> 13:13.025
Spike.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.595
And Harmony.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.697
Buffy. Hi.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.200
What a cute outfit... last year.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.036
SPIKE:
Well, this
is interesting.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.940
It's, uh, sort of a double date.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.509
Looks like your friend started
the party a little early,

13:29.542 --> 13:31.311
huh?
(Spike laughs)

13:31.344 --> 13:34.847
Say, let's have a look
at the new boy.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.350
Hi. I'm Parker.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.889
SPIKE:
I like him.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.823
He's got, um... What's the word?

13:44.857 --> 13:47.226
Vulnerability.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.328
And you're with Harmony. Hmm.
What, did you lose a bet?

13:49.361 --> 13:51.298
Hey!
Actually,

13:51.331 --> 13:53.033
uh, how we met? It's, um...

13:53.066 --> 13:54.902
It's a funny story,
really. It's...

13:54.934 --> 13:56.336
(groaning)

13:56.369 --> 13:58.504
Stay here!

14:00.840 --> 14:04.677
(tires squealing,
engine revving and retreating)

14:04.711 --> 14:07.179
(indistinct crowd chatter)

14:18.958 --> 14:21.561
(twig snaps)

14:21.594 --> 14:23.263
(grunting)

14:23.296 --> 14:26.832
What's the matter, Spike?
Dru dump you again?

14:26.865 --> 14:29.036
(grunting)

14:29.068 --> 14:30.870
Maybe I dumped her!

14:30.903 --> 14:32.338
(grunting)

14:32.371 --> 14:35.241
She left him for a fungus demon.
That's all

14:35.274 --> 14:38.278
he talks about
most days.
Harm!

14:38.311 --> 14:40.080
We are going.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.548
It isn't time yet.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.085
Yeah, but as soon
as we have the Gem of Amara,

14:45.118 --> 14:46.719
you're gonna be sorry...
(loud grunting)

14:46.753 --> 14:49.121
Sor... What? Ow!

14:54.760 --> 14:57.129
(rhythmic chugging
of washing machine)

15:02.568 --> 15:04.636
(knocking)

15:04.671 --> 15:06.306
Come in.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.315
Anya. Hi again.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.951
Your mother sent me around
from the front of the house.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.918
She also said
to ask you to add

15:19.952 --> 15:21.821
fabric softener
when the timer goes off.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.758
Can we talk some more?
Yeah. I suppose.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.159
Would you care
for something?

15:27.193 --> 15:29.928
I have cran-apple.
All right.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.434
You know, it is customary
to call before

15:35.467 --> 15:39.438
you show up, not that...

15:39.471 --> 15:42.642
BUFFY:
 Yeah.

15:42.674 --> 15:45.345
Spike with Harmony,
if you can believe it.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.313
I couldn't figure out
why he ran away,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.481
but Harmony said something,

15:49.515 --> 15:50.917
why they were here.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.585
They were looking
for the Gem of something.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.520
Um... Amara.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.155
The Gem of Amara.
Are you sure?

15:56.188 --> 15:58.091
Yeah. What's up?

15:58.125 --> 16:01.028
Uh, it's just it's, um...
it's not real.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.163
It's like the, uh,
the vampire equivalent

16:03.196 --> 16:05.365
of the, uh... the holy grail,

16:05.398 --> 16:08.268
a source of some...
enormous power

16:08.301 --> 16:10.836
which is conveniently vague.

16:10.870 --> 16:15.508
Uh... I think.
Here it is. Yes. Um,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.344
"There was a great deal
of vampiric interest

16:17.376 --> 16:19.011
in locating the gem during..."

16:19.046 --> 16:21.780
Oh, the tenth century.

16:21.813 --> 16:24.551
"Questing vampires
combed the Earth,

16:24.583 --> 16:26.119
"but no one found it.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.020
It was concluded
that it never existed."

16:28.054 --> 16:29.956
Well, Spike seems
to think it exists,

16:29.989 --> 16:31.957
and he's looking in Sunnydale.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.227
Yes. Well, I'll research it
as best I can.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.629
You've done all you can
for tonight. Go to bed.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.865
Uh-huh.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.866
Sleepy. Yawn.

16:40.899 --> 16:42.168
Bye.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.176
Is Antonio Banderas
a vampire?

16:49.209 --> 16:51.344
No.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.678
Oh.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.548
Can I make him a vampire?

16:55.581 --> 16:56.849
No.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.687
Wait. On second
thought, yeah.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.754
Go do that.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.021
Take your time.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.558
Do Melanie and
the kids as well.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.161
Hey, I don't have a pulse.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.996
Cool!

17:10.028 --> 17:12.199
Can we eat a doctor
so I can get a stethoscope

17:12.231 --> 17:13.900
and hear my heart not beating?

17:13.932 --> 17:16.035
Harm...

17:16.068 --> 17:17.670
What does it take to get you

17:17.703 --> 17:20.207
to shut the hell up?!

17:21.906 --> 17:23.143
(laughs)

17:25.944 --> 17:28.181
And if my heart's not beating,

17:28.214 --> 17:30.048
then what are
all these veins for?

17:31.617 --> 17:34.019
I'm simply covered
in these blue veins.

17:34.052 --> 17:35.654
See?

17:37.656 --> 17:42.628
* I can see you in my past

17:42.662 --> 17:47.767
* But this time's
been so alone *

17:47.799 --> 17:51.270
* Can't seem to find you

17:51.304 --> 17:55.541
* But I've come
to take you home *

17:55.575 --> 17:57.144
We've got an extra
set of chains.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.911
Ew.

17:58.944 --> 18:01.980
Just because Dorcus
went in for that...

18:02.013 --> 18:03.816
Drusilla.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.117
Whatever.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.488
Say her name.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.721
Dorcus.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.057
Bite your tongue.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.326
Do it for me.

18:13.359 --> 18:18.298
* When we met last

18:18.330 --> 18:20.133
* Don't lose...

18:20.166 --> 18:21.401
ANYA:
At which point,

18:21.433 --> 18:22.669
the matter is brought
to a conclusion

18:22.701 --> 18:24.503
with both parties
satisfied

18:24.537 --> 18:27.140
and able to move on with their
separate lives and interests.

18:27.173 --> 18:30.143
To sum up, I think
it's a workable plan.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.478
So...

18:31.510 --> 18:34.012
the crux of this plan is...

18:34.046 --> 18:35.748
Sexual intercourse.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.115
I've said it, like,
a dozen times.
Uh-huh.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.085
Just working through

18:39.117 --> 18:41.520
a little hysterical
deafness here.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.855
I think it's the secret
to getting you out of my mind.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.525
Putting you behind me.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.493
Behind me, figuratively.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.096
I'm thinking face-to-face
for the event itself.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.330
Ah.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.432
Right.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.167
It's just... we hardly
know each other.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.002
I mean, I like you,

18:57.036 --> 18:59.471
and you have
a certain...

18:59.506 --> 19:01.307
directness
that I admire.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.575
But sexual interc...

19:04.676 --> 19:08.047
What you're talking
about... well--

19:08.079 --> 19:12.018
and I'm actually turning
into a woman as I say this--

19:12.050 --> 19:14.886
but it's about
expressing something.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.056
And accepting
consequences.

19:17.088 --> 19:18.325
Oh, I have condoms.

19:18.357 --> 19:19.791
Some are black.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.328
That's...

19:22.362 --> 19:24.330
that's very considerate.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.897
I like you.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.834
You're funny,
and you're nicely shaped,

19:27.866 --> 19:30.470
and frankly, it's ludicrous to
have these interlocking bodies

19:30.502 --> 19:32.904
and not... interlock.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.042
Please remove
your clothing now.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.747
And the amazing thing?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.551
Still more romantic
than Faith.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.961
(washer dings)

19:56.628 --> 19:57.896
(whispering):
Fabric softener.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.933
*

20:03.803 --> 20:06.873
* The way I wanted

20:06.905 --> 20:08.775
Parker.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.278
I was afraid
I wasn't going to be
able to find you.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.512
I was getting
a little worried.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.080
I'm so sorry.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.449
It's just...

20:16.482 --> 20:18.851
The English guy is, uh...

20:18.884 --> 20:23.055
an old friend, and, uh, he's not
supposed to drink,

20:23.088 --> 20:25.791
and I saw him here, you know,
in the land of the beer...

20:25.825 --> 20:27.926
Buffy, it's okay.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.096
You did a good thing
for your friend.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.432
Did, uh...

20:33.465 --> 20:35.367
you and he used to, like,

20:35.402 --> 20:37.202
go out or...
(laughs)

20:37.236 --> 20:38.438
Oh.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.872
Mmm. Um...

20:39.905 --> 20:41.140
No.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.942
No. We really...

20:42.974 --> 20:45.377
really didn't.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.645
Good.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.586
Now we have time to make up for.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.087
Think I could get a dance

20:56.122 --> 20:57.656
with the prettiest girl
at the party?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.759
And what do I do,

20:59.791 --> 21:01.493
just stand here and watch?

21:01.528 --> 21:03.162
(chuckles)

21:05.964 --> 21:08.734
* It was a Monday

21:08.768 --> 21:12.137
* When my lover told me

21:12.171 --> 21:14.773
* Never pay the reaper

21:14.807 --> 21:17.943
* With love only

21:17.977 --> 21:21.180
* What could I say to you

21:21.212 --> 21:24.016
* Except I love you?

21:24.049 --> 21:27.987
* And I'd give
my life for yours *

21:28.019 --> 21:30.323
* I know we are

21:30.356 --> 21:33.660
* We are the lucky ones

21:33.692 --> 21:36.462
* I know we are

21:36.496 --> 21:40.031
* We are the lucky ones

21:40.066 --> 21:42.835
* I know we are

21:42.868 --> 21:46.705
* We are the lucky ones,
dear... *

21:52.511 --> 21:56.383
Well, I declared pre-med,
but I hated it,

21:56.415 --> 21:58.351
so I switched to history.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.720
History?

22:00.752 --> 22:03.321
Fascinating dates
and compelling places.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.557
But there's
something amazing

22:05.592 --> 22:07.993
about these huge events

22:08.027 --> 22:09.528
that, when you
dig down into them,

22:09.561 --> 22:11.230
they're all about people.

22:11.262 --> 22:15.067
Just regular people
just trying to make choices.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.803
When you
look back at it,

22:16.836 --> 22:18.570
it seems like people
were swept up

22:18.605 --> 22:21.874
in events they couldn't control.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.576
But I don't believe that.

22:23.609 --> 22:27.078
You always have a choice
with everything you do.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.015
* I know we are

22:29.048 --> 22:32.551
* We are the lucky ones

22:32.585 --> 22:34.554
* I know we are

22:34.586 --> 22:39.357
* We are the lucky ones, dear

22:39.392 --> 22:41.493
* My dear

22:41.528 --> 22:44.631
Is this okay?

22:46.265 --> 22:48.535
Because I could stop
if you wanted.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.769
It's your choice.

22:49.801 --> 22:52.904
* I thank God for you

22:52.939 --> 22:55.240
What are you doing?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.276
* In each and every single way

22:57.308 --> 22:59.045
Making a choice.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.082
* I know

23:03.115 --> 23:04.451
* I know *

23:04.483 --> 23:06.051
* I know

23:06.085 --> 23:07.720
* I know *

23:07.753 --> 23:08.954
* I know

23:08.988 --> 23:10.355
* I know *

23:10.388 --> 23:12.290
* I know

23:12.324 --> 23:13.625
* I know *

23:13.660 --> 23:17.128
* It's time to let you know

23:17.163 --> 23:20.098
* Time to let you know

23:20.132 --> 23:23.269
* Time to let
you know *

23:23.301 --> 23:28.074
* Time to sit here and say

23:28.106 --> 23:30.108
*

23:32.344 --> 23:35.481
* I know we are
(line ringing)

23:35.515 --> 23:37.316
BUFFY:
Hey, this is Buffy and Willow.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.417
We're not in right now,
so please leave a message.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.386
* I know we are
(beep)

23:41.420 --> 23:43.655
* We are the lucky ones...
Buffy, you there?

23:43.690 --> 23:46.092
Call me. I need to talk
to you right away.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.996
* We are,
we are the lucky ones *

23:50.028 --> 23:57.002
* I know we are,
we are the lucky ones *

23:57.036 --> 23:59.939
* Dear, dear

23:59.971 --> 24:02.842
* We are the lucky ones

24:02.875 --> 24:06.112
* Dear, dear

24:06.144 --> 24:10.316
* We are the lucky ones, dear.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.625
(distant chatter, shouting
and traffic)

24:24.997 --> 24:27.567
(sighs softly)

24:30.836 --> 24:33.673
Parker?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.126
Okay.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.230
Just... shirt.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
Pants.

25:01.032 --> 25:03.803
Everybody needs pants.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.971
Hey, you're up.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.140
You're here.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.242
I live here.
Uh, I just...

25:11.277 --> 25:13.011
I didn't know
where you were.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.846
Oh, it seemed like you were
gonna be out for a while,

25:14.881 --> 25:16.481
so I ran out for coffee.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.483
It's better than whatever
I got around here--

25:18.517 --> 25:20.318
warm soda and
breath mints.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.088
Breath mints.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.856
I wouldn't be turning
them down right now.

25:24.891 --> 25:29.095
So, do you have
plans today, or...?

25:29.127 --> 25:33.531
Actually, my mom's
coming to visit.

25:33.566 --> 25:37.103
Oh. Well, I'll just
clear out then.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.073
But maybe we could, um,

25:41.106 --> 25:42.674
you know, talk
or something later?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.076
Absolutely. I'll
give you a call.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.179
Great.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.248
Oh, um, one more thing
before I go.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.017
A kiss?

25:51.049 --> 25:54.787
Well, I was going to go
with pants, but, uh...
(laughs)

25:54.820 --> 25:56.588
Kiss is good, too.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.101
(sighs)

26:09.134 --> 26:11.237
So I-I'm over you now.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.441
Um...

26:15.473 --> 26:18.410
Okay.

26:18.443 --> 26:21.413
Okay?!

26:21.446 --> 26:24.083
Yeah?

26:24.115 --> 26:26.184
(scoffs)

26:35.461 --> 26:38.730
Harm, what
are you doing?

26:38.765 --> 26:42.433
I'm writing "Spike loves
Harmony" on your back.

26:42.468 --> 26:43.769
Why?

26:43.802 --> 26:46.438
I don't know.
It's fun. I'm bored.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.440
You can write on me.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.443
Got to get back to work.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.449
You love that tunnel
more than me.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.484
I love syphilis
more than you.

27:00.787 --> 27:04.155
(sighs)

27:08.160 --> 27:09.595
GILES:
Um, good morning.

27:09.627 --> 27:11.130
Giles.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.665
I didn't know you were here.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.300
Oh, really?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.703
Um, I-I was,
uh, studying.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.570
At the library.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.808
All... Saturday... night.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.676
Uh... you know what?

27:24.711 --> 27:27.512
I'm an adult, and it's none
of your business where I was.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.181
And I'm sincerely
relieved to hear it.

27:29.214 --> 27:32.518
Uh, now, um, can we discuss
the impending disaster?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.854
Giles found something.
A text.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.622
It refers to
the Gem of Amara

27:36.654 --> 27:39.290
as residing in the
Valley of the Sun.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.126
Demon fancy talk
for Sunnydale.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.061
It seems that Spike
may know what it's about.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.497
That the gem may exist after all

27:45.530 --> 27:47.866
in Sunnydale
in a sealed underground crypt.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.868
Why don't you guys try
and locate the crypt?

27:49.902 --> 27:52.238
I'll see if I can find Spike
before he gets there.

27:52.270 --> 27:53.873
Ah, I'll get started.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.708
I'll call Xander and Oz,
have them meet at your place.

27:55.741 --> 27:58.609
GILES:
Right.

28:00.445 --> 28:04.182
It happened, right?
Did it happen with Parker?

28:04.215 --> 28:06.652
Yeah, it happened.
Well, and?

28:06.684 --> 28:09.520
Details. I mean, not details.
I-I don't need a diagram,

28:09.555 --> 28:13.392
but you know, like maybe
a blurry watercolor.

28:13.424 --> 28:15.326
It was nice.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.729
It was really nice.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.163
He's gonna call.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.766
Oh, I love this part.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.500
Don't you love this part?

28:21.532 --> 28:24.336
When it's all new,
and everything's a discovery.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.704
I don't know, uh...

28:26.739 --> 28:29.174
I guess I do.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.778
It's here!
(laughing):
I knew it was here.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.780
We're close now.
(liquid dripping)

28:34.814 --> 28:37.115
No one leaves the lair
till we're in.

28:37.148 --> 28:39.550
I don't want the slayer
tracking anyone to the tunnel.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.721
And that means you, Harm.
You're an indoor kitty now.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.257
But, Spike, you said
you'd take me places.

28:45.290 --> 28:48.559
You said we'd go to France, and
now I can't even leave the lair?

28:48.594 --> 28:50.662
(all groaning,
indistinct muttering)

28:53.598 --> 28:55.433
Listen to me,

28:55.467 --> 28:57.568
you stupid bint,

28:57.603 --> 29:01.539
this gem is everything.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.743
I came back to Sunnydale for it,
a place which has witnessed

29:05.778 --> 29:09.714
some truly spectacular
kickings of my ass.

29:09.748 --> 29:15.320
Now... when I have the gem,
they all die. Don't worry.

29:15.354 --> 29:19.157
But until then, stay inside.

29:20.491 --> 29:24.296
And by the way,
I would be insanely happy

29:24.329 --> 29:29.701
if from this point on I heard
bugger all about sodding France!

29:33.439 --> 29:36.741
I don't know why I let you be
so mean to me.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.878
Love hurts, baby.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.849
* Water turns to sand

29:43.883 --> 29:46.885
* It turns to sand

29:49.121 --> 29:55.126
* Follow me,
I'm going underground *

29:57.628 --> 30:02.701
* This orbit is an interlude

30:05.971 --> 30:08.339
* Temporary, planetary food...

30:08.374 --> 30:13.378
MALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
You've got one new message
at 9:05 p.m.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.446
(beep)
WILLOW:
Hi, it's me. I'm at Giles's.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.884
Did Parker call yet?

30:20.920 --> 30:26.424
* Lend me your fire
so I can burn *

30:29.560 --> 30:33.699
* Save all my ashes
for my return *

30:37.403 --> 30:42.040
* Not with a scream,
but with a sigh... *

31:10.970 --> 31:13.638
It's real.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.842
HARMONY:
Ooh.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.243
Pretty.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.611
Can I take stuff?

31:19.644 --> 31:22.080
(sighs)
Take whatever you want.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.782
I don't care.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.296
(jewelry clinking)

31:44.802 --> 31:46.204
Ew!

31:46.238 --> 31:48.941
Like you're too good
to work a clasp.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.343
(scoffs)

31:52.611 --> 31:53.945
So?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.747
Is it doing it?

31:55.780 --> 31:57.383
Do you feel it?
(sniffles)

31:57.415 --> 31:59.384
(clears his throat)

31:59.417 --> 32:01.752
I mean, you don't
look any different...

32:01.787 --> 32:03.489
if you wondered.

32:03.521 --> 32:06.291
I thought maybe you'd look
taller or glow or something.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.925
Hmm.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.567
(hissing, Spike yells)

32:16.602 --> 32:18.237
You should put some butter
on that.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.671
But, hey, maybe it's worth

32:19.704 --> 32:21.240
money anyway.
That would be something.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.009
And then we could go to France.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.576
And I always wanted to go
to France and stay in a chateau.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.144
You could take me
shopping and...

32:26.178 --> 32:27.913
(grunts)
(whimpering)

32:27.945 --> 32:30.016
(grunts)
(whooshing)

32:30.048 --> 32:32.483
I can't believe
you just did that.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.920
(grunting)

32:34.952 --> 32:36.755
Hold on.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.523
(groans)

32:43.461 --> 32:46.698
What are you doing,
you big freak?

32:47.965 --> 32:49.934
That's my gem.
Don't...

32:49.968 --> 32:51.436
Fine. Fine.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.173
If that's all that matters
to you, then just take it!

32:54.205 --> 32:57.675
Take it! Take it
and get out!

32:57.709 --> 32:59.177
That's a good idea.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.712
(panting)

33:01.747 --> 33:03.981
I think I'll go
play outside.

33:07.818 --> 33:09.788
(sighs)

33:09.820 --> 33:13.058
Okay, either I'm borrowing all
your albums, or I'm movin' in.
Oz,

33:13.092 --> 33:15.027
there are more important things
than records right now.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.996
More important than this one?

33:18.029 --> 33:21.299
Um, I suppose an argument
could be made for...

33:21.333 --> 33:22.701
XANDER:
Whoa.

33:22.733 --> 33:24.336
Giles has a TV.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.071
Everybody, Giles has a TV.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.474
He's shallow like us.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.242
I got to admit,
a little disappointed.
I-I-I...

33:31.277 --> 33:34.212
Well, maybe it doesn't work.
It-it's like art.

33:34.246 --> 33:37.548
NEWSWOMAN:
And in breaking local news,
area residents face traffic

33:37.583 --> 33:39.218
disruptions causing safety
concerns today...
Public television.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.986
...following the formation
of a giant sinkhole...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.988
Look, look, come on, everyone,
we have vital work to do.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.855
Watching television is not gonna
help us right now.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.059
...near the UC Sunnydale campus.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.927
Officials attributed
the unusual occurrence

33:49.961 --> 33:54.266
to weakening of the topsoil
support nearby. City work crews

33:54.299 --> 33:57.001
deny that any tunneling
has been done in the area.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.038
Tunneling?
Although this is the most likely
cause of said weakening...

34:00.071 --> 34:02.574
Spike. Come on.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.876
Xander, find Buffy
and meet us there.

34:05.911 --> 34:08.547
No one was injured
when the tower collapsed.

34:08.579 --> 34:12.351
Traffic was redirected
into side streets, and...

34:12.384 --> 34:14.985
(indistinct crowd chatter)

34:19.925 --> 34:23.893
I mean, it hit me hard,
you know? My dad.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.697
Since then, I just don't
put stuff off anymore.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.800
It's about
living for now.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.768
Parker?

34:31.802 --> 34:35.940
Buffy. Buffy Summers, this is

34:35.974 --> 34:37.708
Katy Loomis.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.077
What's going on?

34:40.112 --> 34:42.981
Uh, hey, Katy, you're
gonna be late for class.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.782
I'll catch up later, okay?

34:48.652 --> 34:50.255
She's a friend of yours?

34:50.289 --> 34:52.757
Yeah, you'd like her a bunch.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.059
So, what's up?

34:55.092 --> 34:59.097
Well, um, you didn't call.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.666
I... I mean,
I'd understand, you know,

35:01.699 --> 35:04.603
if you were busy
or sick or something.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.070
It's only been a
couple of days.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.639
You need to talk to
me about something?

35:08.673 --> 35:11.277
Is everything okay?

35:11.309 --> 35:13.244
Sure it is.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.981
It is?
Sure.

35:16.014 --> 35:20.286
Oh, um, so, maybe do you want
to... do something?

35:20.318 --> 35:22.820
We could do that. Absolutely.

35:22.853 --> 35:25.356
Great. How about tonight?

35:25.391 --> 35:27.925
Oh. Well, the thing is,

35:27.958 --> 35:32.130
I think I'm supposed to get
together with some people later.

35:33.731 --> 35:36.967
Parker, um, did I...?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.208
Did I do something wrong?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.842
Something wrong?

35:44.876 --> 35:47.045
No, of course not.

35:47.077 --> 35:48.880
It was fun.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.715
Didn't you have fun?

35:50.748 --> 35:53.952
I mean, watch out
how you answer that.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.387
My ego is fragile.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.789
You had fun?

35:57.822 --> 35:59.858
Is that all it was?

35:59.891 --> 36:02.027
Well, what else was
it supposed to be?

36:04.929 --> 36:07.666
It seemed... like...

36:07.699 --> 36:09.867
you liked me.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.802
I do.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.206
But I'm starting to feel like
you thought that meant... what?

36:15.240 --> 36:18.009
Some kind of commitment?

36:18.043 --> 36:21.112
I mean, is that really
what you want right now?

36:22.380 --> 36:26.016
I just... thought...

36:26.050 --> 36:30.188
Look, I'm sorry if you
misunderstood something. I...

36:30.222 --> 36:33.057
I... I thought
things were pretty clear.

36:33.090 --> 36:36.027
I-I didn't mean to mis...

36:36.061 --> 36:39.030
I'm-I'm s... I'm sorry.

36:40.231 --> 36:43.268
Look, I really have to go now.

36:51.041 --> 36:53.711
Parker, wait!

36:53.744 --> 36:55.547
I did this all wrong.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.617
No, it's cool.
We'll hook up later.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.420
SPIKE:
Well, that was pathetic.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.795
SPIKE:
What a fantastic day.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.697
Birds singin', squirrels makin'
lots of rotten little squirrels,

37:12.731 --> 37:15.967
sun beamin' down
in a nice non-fatal way.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.302
It's very exciting.

37:17.335 --> 37:18.704
Can't wait to see if I freckle.

37:18.737 --> 37:22.907
(grunting)

37:29.114 --> 37:33.485
Oh, do it again. It tickles.
(squishy whooshing)

37:33.518 --> 37:34.985
You know, in a good way.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.222
The gem.
Oh, yeah.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.025
The Gem of Amara.

37:42.027 --> 37:45.563
Official sponsor
of my killing you.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.298
(growling)

37:51.670 --> 37:54.306
WILLOW:
Harmony?

37:56.375 --> 37:59.177
(crying):
Being a vampire sucks.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.679
(sighs)

38:00.711 --> 38:02.112
(growling)

38:02.146 --> 38:04.516
Buffy!

38:07.152 --> 38:09.820
Xander. I...
I was looking for you.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.657
You weren't
in your musty basement.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.125
Have you seen Buffy?
No.

38:14.159 --> 38:17.362
Uh, about, you know,
what happened, um...

38:17.396 --> 38:19.498
When I said I was over you--
I mean, I really...

38:19.530 --> 38:22.233
Anya, I don't have time.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.505
GILES:
 Harmony,

38:27.539 --> 38:30.208
where's Spike?

38:30.240 --> 38:32.143
Does he have the gem?

38:35.179 --> 38:37.382
He staked me,
and then he took it.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.851
He tried to take it
right off my finger.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.954
Like I wouldn't have
just given it to him.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.789
I would have given him
anything he wanted.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.693
He was my platinum baby,
and I loved him.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.927
Where did Spike go?

38:53.998 --> 38:57.568
(grunting)

39:04.342 --> 39:06.878
Aah!
(growling)

39:06.911 --> 39:10.416
(grunting, bones crunching)

39:13.117 --> 39:15.586
(grunts, growling)

39:15.621 --> 39:20.025
(grunting)

39:28.032 --> 39:31.436
Getting tired, Slayer?

39:33.137 --> 39:36.407
(growling)
(both grunting)

39:39.143 --> 39:42.146
(grunting)
BUFFY:
Xander? Get out of here!

39:46.083 --> 39:50.021
So, you let Parker
take a poke, eh?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.557
Didn't seem like
you knew each other that well.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.693
What exactly did it take
to pry apart

39:54.726 --> 39:56.561
the slayer's dimpled knees?

39:56.594 --> 39:58.195
You're a pig, Spike.

39:58.228 --> 40:00.731
(growls, both grunting)

40:00.766 --> 40:03.400
Did he play the sensitive lad
and get you to seduce him?

40:03.434 --> 40:06.403
That's a good trick if the
girl's thick enough to buy it.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.940
(grunting)

40:08.974 --> 40:11.909
I wonder what you did wrong.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.978
Uh, too strong?

40:14.012 --> 40:16.114
Did you bruise the boy?

40:16.146 --> 40:20.284
Whatever. Guess you're
not worth a second go.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.621
Come to think of it, seems like
someone told me as much.

40:22.653 --> 40:25.322
Who was that? Oh, yeah.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.125
Angel.

40:31.996 --> 40:35.132
(grunting)

40:38.268 --> 40:41.405
Ugh! Take it off me this way,

40:41.438 --> 40:43.340
we both burn!
Really?

40:43.373 --> 40:45.577
Let's see.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.445
(Spike growling,
hissing sound)

40:47.478 --> 40:50.014
Ow! Aah!

40:50.047 --> 40:52.182
(panting)

40:57.355 --> 40:59.123
WILLOW:
I like it.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.326
It's small.

41:01.358 --> 41:03.460
Really worth
getting my ribs bashed in.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.931
It's obviously very dangerous,
and, uh, we're destroying it.

41:05.963 --> 41:09.434
We don't
destroy it.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.436
Well, Buffy, any vampire
that gets his hands on this

41:11.469 --> 41:12.871
is going to be
essentially un-killable.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.242
Oh.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.612
OZ:
I have

41:21.646 --> 41:23.380
that gig in L.A.
I could swing by.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.282
Thanks, Oz.
XANDER:
What's going on?

41:25.315 --> 41:27.452
What's in L.A.?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.454
She's giving the ring to Angel.
Don't make a fuss.

41:30.487 --> 41:31.889
Buffy,

41:31.922 --> 41:34.291
are you sure?

41:34.324 --> 41:36.360
He should have it.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.467
BUFFY:
 So what I'm wondering is,

41:42.500 --> 41:45.335
does this always happen?

41:45.369 --> 41:49.807
Sleep with a guy,
and he goes all evil?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.976
God, I'm just a fool.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.344
Well, maybe you made a
mistake, but that's okay.

41:54.378 --> 41:57.849
Next time... What?

41:59.585 --> 42:03.188
Parker said it's okay
to make mistakes.

42:03.221 --> 42:06.190
It was sweet.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.826
No, it wasn't.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.827
He was saying that

42:09.860 --> 42:11.996
so you would take a
chance and sleep with him.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.532
He's a poophead.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.001
You're right.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.938
He's... manipulative
and shallow.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.074
And why doesn't he want me?

42:23.108 --> 42:24.943
Am I repulsive?

42:24.976 --> 42:28.679
If there was something repulsive
about me, you'd tell me, right?

42:28.713 --> 42:30.280
I'm your friend.

42:30.315 --> 42:33.284
I would call you
repulsive in a second.

42:34.719 --> 42:37.521
Maybe Parker and I
could still work it out.

42:37.554 --> 42:41.192
Do you... you think that
we could still work it out?

42:41.226 --> 42:42.860
I think you're missing something

42:42.893 --> 42:45.295
about the whole
poophead principle.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.202
You know, you go on ahead.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.438
I... I think
I'm gonna go take a walk.

42:54.472 --> 42:57.742
Are you sure?
Yeah.

43:20.130 --> 43:22.867
(sniffles)

44:08.045 --> 44:10.514
Grr. Argh.
