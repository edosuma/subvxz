00:01.382 --> 00:03.315
That is a scary stack
of books.

00:04.162 --> 00:06.480
Does Mommy have
to read all those?

00:06.548 --> 00:08.849
Of course.
That's what you do

00:08.917 --> 00:10.217
when you go
to law school.

00:10.285 --> 00:11.919
Read books and
argue with people.

00:11.986 --> 00:13.253
Hey, what's going on?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.255
We suddenly having
a bowl shortage?

00:15.306 --> 00:17.424
We're just trying to save
our natural resources.

00:17.492 --> 00:19.643
This way, we only have
to wash the spoons.

00:21.128 --> 00:22.796
Okay, girls, shut that off.

00:22.864 --> 00:24.681
Grab your homework. Bedtime.

00:29.871 --> 00:31.338
Hello.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.608
Yes, hi.
I'm looking for a young college coed.

00:34.676 --> 00:36.777
A law student named
Allison Dubois?

00:36.844 --> 00:38.612
Smooth, Joe College.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.781
So, are you on the plane yet?

00:40.848 --> 00:42.849
Yes, we just boarded.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.669
Hey, listen, I wanted to try
one more time to convince you

00:45.753 --> 00:48.088
that you don't need to
pick me up in the morning.

00:48.155 --> 00:51.041
I think you should focus on
your first day of school.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.793
Well, that's awful thoughtful
of you, Daddy,

00:52.860 --> 00:55.796
but it's been six days since
I've laid eyes on you.

00:55.863 --> 00:58.298
I can't wait to see that tan
that you got in Hawaii.

00:58.366 --> 01:01.268
Hawaii?
Is that where I was?

01:01.335 --> 01:03.437
All I remember is the inside
of a military base.

01:03.504 --> 01:04.688
Hey, girls, it's Daddy.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.373
You want to say good night?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.841
Night, Dad!
See ya tomorrow!

01:07.892 --> 01:08.875
Love you, Daddy!

01:08.943 --> 01:10.410
Sweet dreams.

01:10.478 --> 01:11.612
Did you get that?

01:11.679 --> 01:14.081
Loud and clear.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:14.148 --> 01:19.253
Yep. I'll be the one who looks
like a first-year law student.

Hello.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.131
Hey, it's me.

01:31.199 --> 01:34.101
I'm sorry to call so early.
We picked up a tailwind,

01:34.168 --> 01:36.536
so we're landing at 5:00
instead of 6:00.

01:36.604 --> 01:38.872
So I already called
for the car service,

01:38.940 --> 01:41.174
so you just go back to sleep.

01:41.242 --> 01:45.112
Honey? Honey, what?
I just lost you for a second.

01:45.179 --> 01:46.780
Sorry.

01:46.881 --> 01:49.583
We just hit some turbulence
or something. Hold on, babe.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.485
PILOT
At this time I'm going

01:51.552 --> 01:53.186
to ask you to fasten
your seatbelts.

01:53.237 --> 01:54.821
Joe, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

01:54.889 --> 01:56.723
Uh, everything's fine, sweetie.

01:56.791 --> 02:00.027
Just a little bumpy.

02:01.195 --> 02:04.364
Joe, what's going on?
Talk to me!

02:04.415 --> 02:08.535
I love you, Allison!
I love you very...!

02:11.739 --> 02:14.141
Joe! Joe, Joe?!

Ladies and gentlemen
<i>of the jury: congratulations.</i>

03:06.605 --> 03:09.890
Today, the city of Phoenix
is presenting you

03:09.942 --> 03:12.387
with an extraordinary
opportunity,

03:12.829 --> 03:18.267
but it is also entrusting you
with a grave responsibility.

03:18.859 --> 03:22.212
Luis Amenabar has been the head

03:22.296 --> 03:26.132
of the Sola de Vega narcotics
cartel for over a decade.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.517
And during that time,

03:27.601 --> 03:31.170
he has ordered the execution
of dozens of men and women,

03:31.222 --> 03:34.541
both here in Arizona
and in Mexico.

03:34.608 --> 03:36.609
And then we go  into the list charges,
and the witnesses...

03:36.677 --> 03:37.944
That's all right.

03:38.012 --> 03:39.779
I just wanted to hear the
beginning. That's great!

03:39.847 --> 03:41.314
That's really terrific.

03:41.382 --> 03:44.150
I'm glad I got you, got you
to take a pass at writing it.

03:44.218 --> 03:46.319
Well, I tried to make
it sound like you.

03:46.387 --> 03:47.737
Oh, man, you did.

03:47.822 --> 03:49.456
Hell, you know what?

03:49.523 --> 03:52.158
I'm half-tempted to just
let you do it yourself.

03:52.226 --> 03:53.960
You're the D.A.

03:54.028 --> 03:55.228
I'm only the second chair.

03:55.296 --> 03:58.164
Believe me, the jury wants
to hear it from you.

04:00.431 --> 04:02.684
We're really doing this,
aren't we?

04:02.779 --> 04:05.147
We're gonna put that
son of a bitch away.

04:05.215 --> 04:07.449
I think we are.

04:09.642 --> 04:10.809
Get a good night's sleep.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.560
Court's in session
at 1:00.

04:12.645 --> 04:13.812
1:00? Why so late?

04:13.879 --> 04:16.398
I asked the judge
for a continuance.

04:16.482 --> 04:17.432
Tomorrow's an important day.

04:17.516 --> 04:19.351
I wanted you
to have some time.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.055
Well, thank you.

04:24.557 --> 04:26.624
Marie?!

04:26.692 --> 04:30.228
Honey, I'm home.
Sorry I'm late.

04:30.296 --> 04:33.131
I got hungry
and I couldn't wait.

04:33.199 --> 04:35.333
Your trial's all over
the news.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.602
I DVR'd the coverage
if you wanted to watch it.

04:37.670 --> 04:38.636
No, that's okay.

04:38.704 --> 04:39.971
I'm living it.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.741
It's about as much of that
trial as I can take.

04:42.808 --> 04:44.542
So, listen, honey,

04:44.610 --> 04:47.178
court doesn't start
till 1:00 tomorrow,

04:47.246 --> 04:49.647
so I figured we'd drive out
to Wood Lawn in the morning.

04:49.715 --> 04:51.983
Seriously?

04:52.051 --> 04:54.586
Seriously.

04:54.653 --> 04:57.822
It's the anniversary
of your father's death.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.023
We should get out
to the cemetery.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.925
I just don't get
what the point is.

05:00.993 --> 05:03.995
It's not like Dad is
really at Wood Lawn.

05:04.063 --> 05:06.865
Look, Mom,
I'm just saying--

05:06.932 --> 05:10.001
okay?-- Dad's plane
went down in the Pacific.

05:10.069 --> 05:12.904
We buried an empty coffin.

05:12.972 --> 05:14.239
Doesn't it seem silly to you

05:14.306 --> 05:16.508
to go see him every year
when he's not really there?

05:16.575 --> 05:18.510
Marie, it's your father.

05:18.577 --> 05:21.312
His grave is his grave.

05:21.380 --> 05:25.283
Mom, I'm not going this year.

05:25.351 --> 05:26.718
What?

05:26.786 --> 05:29.354
I'm not going.

05:29.422 --> 05:32.056
Dad died
seven years ago, Mom.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.226
I cried about it
every night for how long?

05:35.294 --> 05:37.962
Six months? A year?

05:38.030 --> 05:40.498
And all that time,
he never showed up.

05:40.566 --> 05:43.101
Never said goodbye.

05:44.503 --> 05:46.371
Dad knows who we are.

05:46.439 --> 05:49.107
He knows what we can do.

05:49.175 --> 05:51.910
He didn't have to disappear from
our lives just because he died.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.194
No. He chose to.

05:53.279 --> 05:55.013
Sweetness... Sweetie...

05:55.080 --> 05:56.448
Hey.

05:56.515 --> 05:58.183
I'm sure he had his reasons.

05:59.752 --> 06:01.486
Come on, Mom.

06:01.554 --> 06:05.356
You're not even mad at him
just a little bit?

06:05.424 --> 06:07.859
You never wondered
why he died and just...

06:07.927 --> 06:09.761
left us?

06:23.809 --> 06:25.810
Miss you.

06:32.818 --> 06:35.487
These are from Ariel and Dave.

06:37.456 --> 06:41.159
I can't believe
you never met Dave.

06:43.095 --> 06:45.663
You know, I told Ariel
not to get married

06:45.731 --> 06:48.199
until she graduated
law school, but...

06:50.636 --> 06:52.637
Of course, she ignored me.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.375
Just like
we ignored our parents.

07:00.513 --> 07:02.780
From Bridgette.

07:02.848 --> 07:06.451
Oh, she changed her major again.

07:07.753 --> 07:09.754
It's Creative Writing this time.

07:12.791 --> 07:16.561
From Marie.

07:16.629 --> 07:19.931
She's a teenager now.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.934
She's a good kid.

07:23.002 --> 07:25.436
She'll be okay.

07:27.439 --> 07:29.440
She just misses her dad.

07:33.946 --> 07:37.715
I miss you, too.

07:40.336 --> 07:43.738
Let's all do our best to keep
this from turning into a circus.

07:43.806 --> 07:44.772
Shall we?

07:44.840 --> 07:48.526
Be seated.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.727
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

07:49.795 --> 07:51.796
I'm required to remind you

07:51.864 --> 07:54.132
that the defendant
is presumed innocent

07:54.199 --> 07:56.701
until proven otherwise.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.070
Good luck.

08:00.539 --> 08:02.707
I hear
you're both quite good.

08:02.775 --> 08:06.477
District Attorney Dennis Caruso

08:06.545 --> 08:08.546
will handle opening statements
for the prosecution.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.715
Mr. Caruso?

08:13.619 --> 08:17.855
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, congratulations.

08:17.923 --> 08:19.757
Today, the city of Phoenix

08:19.808 --> 08:23.861
is presenting you with an
extraordinary opportunity.

08:23.929 --> 08:25.930
<i>You want to hear something?</i>

08:25.981 --> 08:28.533
Amenabar's attorney came to me
right after we adjourned.

08:28.601 --> 08:29.968
Put a plea on the table.

08:30.035 --> 08:32.370
They want to make a deal?
Why didn't you tell me?

08:32.438 --> 08:33.821
Not worth discussing.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.907
They offered to have him
plead guilty in Mexico.

08:35.975 --> 08:39.010
We'd extradite him. He'd serve
a life sentence down there.

08:39.078 --> 08:41.346
Problem is, is that
you know and I know

08:41.413 --> 08:43.214
that he would
just keep running the show

08:43.282 --> 08:44.749
from some
white collar prison.

08:44.817 --> 08:47.752
and maybe bribe
his way out in a few years.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.355
Like I said--
not worth discussing.

08:50.422 --> 08:52.490
You should go home.
Have a drink.

08:52.558 --> 08:54.375
Tomorrow morning, we'll keep
nailing him to the wall.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.960
Tomorrow morning!

08:56.028 --> 08:58.029
All right.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.655
Mr. Mayor, can we
get a statement, please?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.723
WOMAN 2: Will your office
be issuing a statement?

09:17.791 --> 09:18.958
Mr. Mayor, any comment
on the slaying

09:19.026 --> 09:20.927
of District Attorney Caruso?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.679
Yes.
I have a comment.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.830
I do.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.967
Dennis Caruso was a friend.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.770
Deputy Mayor DiNovi and I
respected him a great deal,

09:30.837 --> 09:35.074
and our deepest sympathies go
out to his wife and daughters.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.544
He said they wanted a deal.

09:38.612 --> 09:42.148
That's... That's
the last thing he said to me.

09:44.851 --> 09:49.322
He said
that Luis Amenabar's attorneys

09:49.389 --> 09:51.457
wanted him extradited to Mexico

09:51.525 --> 09:53.926
so that he could stand trial
there, and Dennis said "no."

09:57.431 --> 09:58.731
Yeah, Maggie.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.967
I'm sorry
to disturb you, Mr. Mayor,

10:01.034 --> 10:02.935
but the Chief of Detectives
just arrived.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.605
All right.
Send him in.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.513
Hi.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.619
Allison...

10:20.687 --> 10:23.889
Do we know
anything new?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.092
Security cameras
in the garage got nothing.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.727
No one near
Caruso's car all day.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.096
We're guessing the bomb
must have been planted

10:30.163 --> 10:31.197
at some other location.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.799
And no one's
officially taken credit

10:33.867 --> 10:35.001
for what happened,
but, uh,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.836
I think we all know
who's responsible.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.404
Amenabar.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.773
He wants us to know
he's still in control.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.742
Would you two excuse us
for a moment, please?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.976
Yeah.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.919
Lynn's wrong.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.222
Amenabar is not in control.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.224
He wouldn't have done
what he did tonight

10:58.291 --> 10:59.725
if he wasn't afraid.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.329
I don't want him thinking
for even one second

11:03.397 --> 11:05.831
that this is going to keep us
from sending him to prison.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.700
I don't want him to think
for one second

11:07.767 --> 11:09.902
that we're not going
to move forward with this trial.

11:11.972 --> 11:15.041
I'd like you to think
about taking over for Dennis.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.809
You built
this case.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.477
There's no one
more equipped

11:18.545 --> 11:20.479
to move this
forward than you.

11:20.547 --> 11:24.350
If you tell me you'd rather not,
I won't hold it against you--

11:24.418 --> 11:27.086
I'll even tell the media
it was my call--

11:27.154 --> 11:30.423
but if you decide
to see this thing through,

11:30.490 --> 11:33.392
then know that you,
Marie, Bridgette and Ariel

11:33.460 --> 11:34.860
would have round-the-clock
protection

11:34.928 --> 11:36.662
for the duration of this trial.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.197
Amenabar's people
wouldn't be able

11:38.265 --> 11:40.966
to get within 1,000 feet
of any of you.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.270
The choice is yours.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.311
Hey.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.779
Mom, you okay?

11:53.830 --> 11:55.164
I, uh...
I tried calling earlier,

11:55.248 --> 11:57.083
but all I got
was your voice mail.

11:58.335 --> 11:59.985
Listen, Ariel,
I need to tell you

12:00.053 --> 12:02.621
about some things
that are going on here.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.424
No. I understand.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.992
You have to take over
first chair.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.261
What... what other choice
is there?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.163
I don't know.
I could have said no.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.566
I could have let Mr. Devalos
hand the case over

12:13.633 --> 12:14.733
to the interim
district attorney.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.068
Okay.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.137
But what kind of message
do you think that

12:18.205 --> 12:20.473
would have sent to
the Luis Amenabars of the world?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.942
I know. I'm just not crazy
about putting you

12:23.009 --> 12:24.810
and your sisters
through all of this.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.079
I just hate
that I can't do my job

12:27.147 --> 12:29.882
without Mr. Devalos having
to put security details

12:29.950 --> 12:31.417
on all three of you.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.719
Mom, it's okay.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.055
Seriously, we get it.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.125
You know, Marie was so mad
at Daddy today.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.961
She still can't forgive him
for not coming back.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.263
And you know what? She's right.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.565
He could come back
if he really wanted to.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.300
He could tell me what to do.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.554
Mom, what are you talking about?

12:51.638 --> 12:53.339
I mean, he doesn't have to.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.740
You know why?

12:54.808 --> 12:58.244
Because we both already know
exactly what he would have said.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.380
Make us proud.

13:30.126 --> 13:32.144
♪ ♪

13:39.636 --> 13:42.131
The sign that I saw
was in Spanish.

13:42.192 --> 13:44.093
I'm almost positive
it was Mexico.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.994
And I know how
this sounds--

13:46.062 --> 13:47.963
Joe surviving this
plane crash--

13:48.031 --> 13:49.565
but it is not impossible.

13:49.632 --> 13:52.401
At least not according
to the FAA investigator

13:52.469 --> 13:54.703
who analyzed this crash
seven years ago.

13:57.173 --> 13:59.608
Look. You see this?

13:59.676 --> 14:01.176
This is where
the plane went down.

14:01.244 --> 14:02.444
And with the wind

14:02.512 --> 14:04.146
and the strong
water currents that day,

14:04.214 --> 14:06.682
Joe could have just drifted
to one of these beach towns,

14:06.750 --> 14:09.351
like Rosarito or Ensenada.

14:09.418 --> 14:11.153
If he survived the crash.

14:11.221 --> 14:12.638
If he survived the crash.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.224
Look, sir...

14:15.291 --> 14:16.692
I know you have
connections

14:16.760 --> 14:18.160
in Mexican law
enforcement.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.629
I was just hoping maybe you
could reach out to them,

14:20.697 --> 14:23.499
see if maybe somebody remembers
seeing someone

14:23.566 --> 14:25.768
matching Joe's description
washing up

14:25.835 --> 14:28.070
on one of their beach towns
seven years ago.

14:28.138 --> 14:29.404
Allison...

14:29.472 --> 14:31.573
after my daughter,
Arianna, died,

14:31.641 --> 14:35.711
there were times I swore
I saw her across a crowded room.

14:35.779 --> 14:37.479
I heard her voice
right behind me.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.281
This is not that.

14:39.349 --> 14:42.751
And you, of all people,
should know.

14:42.819 --> 14:46.655
I've been having these dreams
my whole life,

14:46.723 --> 14:51.126
and they almost always lead me
to something that matters.

14:52.796 --> 14:54.797
Okay.

14:55.899 --> 14:57.599
Okay.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.134
I'll call my friends in Mexico.

14:59.185 --> 15:01.003
I'll forward them
whatever photographs of Joe

15:01.070 --> 15:02.905
you think would be most helpful.

15:02.972 --> 15:04.306
Thank you.

15:04.374 --> 15:05.908
<i>Mr. Ruiz,</i>

15:05.975 --> 15:08.944
would you kindly identify
the men in this photograph?

15:09.979 --> 15:11.713
Rico and Steban Treja.

15:11.781 --> 15:14.283
And would you mind telling the
court how you know these men?

15:14.350 --> 15:16.418
Because I killed them.

15:17.954 --> 15:19.888
You killed them?

15:19.956 --> 15:21.223
Why?

15:21.291 --> 15:24.426
Because they were moving
into my territory,

15:24.494 --> 15:28.063
trying to sell their merchandise
where they shouldn't have.

15:28.131 --> 15:30.665
And when you say your territory,

15:30.717 --> 15:34.136
don't you really mean
the Sola de Vega territory?

15:34.187 --> 15:36.371
Sola de Vega,
the same narcotics cartel

15:36.439 --> 15:37.706
that Luis Amenabar

15:37.774 --> 15:40.943
has been running
for a little over a decade?

15:41.010 --> 15:44.279
The same cartel that hired you

15:44.347 --> 15:47.199
to execute their competitors
here in Phoenix

15:47.283 --> 15:48.784
like the Treja brothers?

15:50.386 --> 15:51.920
Well?

15:53.723 --> 15:55.257
Your Honor.

15:55.325 --> 15:57.326
Answer the question, Mr. Ruiz.

15:58.995 --> 16:01.563
I killed the Treja brothers,
okay?

16:01.631 --> 16:03.131
I went to prison for it.

16:03.199 --> 16:04.833
What else do you want me to say?

16:04.901 --> 16:06.468
I want you to say what you said

16:06.536 --> 16:08.703
to the police
the night you were arrested.

16:08.755 --> 16:11.974
I want you to say
that you were ordered

16:12.041 --> 16:16.411
to execute the Trejas by someone
in Sola de Vega cartel.

16:16.479 --> 16:20.766
And I want you
to identify the man

16:20.850 --> 16:23.518
who gave you
that order personally.

16:25.455 --> 16:26.755
No.

16:26.823 --> 16:29.858
I was running
off my mouth.

16:29.926 --> 16:31.627
I didn't take orders
from no one.

16:31.694 --> 16:33.161
He's right here.

16:33.229 --> 16:34.563
He's right behind that table.

16:45.074 --> 16:46.475
Mrs. Dubois?

16:46.542 --> 16:49.144
Would you care
to finish your thought?

16:54.384 --> 16:55.684
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

16:55.752 --> 16:58.987
I'm suddenly--
I'm not feeling very well.

16:59.055 --> 17:01.556
I-I would like to request
a short recess.

17:01.624 --> 17:04.192
Let's call it lunch.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.828
We'll resume at 2:00.

17:08.564 --> 17:09.982
It's okay that
you're nervous.

17:10.066 --> 17:11.400
Pardon me?

17:11.467 --> 17:13.402
It's okay that
you're nervous.

17:13.453 --> 17:15.369
It's a big case.

17:15.438 --> 17:17.539
Mr. Amenabar, I really
don't think that your attorneys

17:17.606 --> 17:19.040
will appreciate us talking

17:19.108 --> 17:20.041
right now.

17:20.108 --> 17:22.911
My lawyers do what I want.

17:22.979 --> 17:26.515
I hear you're going
to be a grandmother.

17:26.582 --> 17:30.652
Your oldest one, right, the
one that lives in Boston?

17:30.720 --> 17:33.788
Believe it or not, I have
three little <i>nietos</i> myself.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.959
They add years to your
life, Mrs. Dubois.

17:41.648 --> 17:43.098
Hello.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.967
Allison, I'm sorry
to bother you at home,

17:45.034 --> 17:48.203
but I just heard back from the
last of my contacts in Mexico.

17:48.271 --> 17:50.339
I'm afraid we've come up empty.

17:50.406 --> 17:53.775
No one found any reports
of an injured man washing up

17:53.843 --> 17:56.044
on a beach in the days
after Joe's plane went down.

17:56.112 --> 17:58.013
I even had 'em search
the records for that whole year,

17:58.081 --> 17:59.514
just to be sure.

17:59.582 --> 18:02.617
I-I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you want to hear.

18:05.855 --> 18:08.423
Your doctors called the station.

18:08.491 --> 18:12.294
I just want to be sure
we get the story right.

18:12.362 --> 18:13.695
So, according
to them,

18:13.763 --> 18:17.733
you just woke up on
a beach two days ago.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.504
You have no idea who you are,
no idea where you're from,

18:22.572 --> 18:26.041
no clue how you
wound up in Mexico?

18:26.109 --> 18:28.043
That's right.

18:28.111 --> 18:30.545
I have a head injury.

18:30.613 --> 18:32.614
My doctor...

18:34.317 --> 18:36.251
I can't remember his name.

18:36.319 --> 18:37.853
Dr. Aguilar.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.855
Right,
Dr. Aguilar.

18:39.922 --> 18:42.657
He says it may be permanent.

18:42.725 --> 18:46.194
He doesn't know if I'll
ever get my memory back.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.133
Please, I just want
to go home.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.969
Okay, where
is home?

18:54.037 --> 18:56.772
I don't know.

18:56.839 --> 18:58.774
Can you help me?

18:58.841 --> 19:00.409
Of course.

19:00.476 --> 19:01.743
Of course we can help you.

19:01.811 --> 19:05.213
We're the police;
that's what we do.

19:05.281 --> 19:10.185
You just listen to your
doctors for now, rest...

19:10.253 --> 19:13.855
and I'll come
see you soon.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.927
English.

19:36.012 --> 19:37.179
I don't want my
driver chatting

19:37.246 --> 19:39.181
to anybody
about this.

19:39.248 --> 19:41.416
Fine.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.885
The story we heard
is accurate.

19:43.953 --> 19:46.221
He has no idea who he is,

19:46.289 --> 19:49.825
and the doctors think
the brain damage is bad.

19:49.892 --> 19:51.893
Hmm.

19:55.364 --> 19:57.365
I appreciate your hard work.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.950
Mr. Amenabar, gentlemen,

20:16.018 --> 20:17.585
thank you for coming
on such short notice.

20:17.653 --> 20:19.520
Your office is bringing
an additional charge

20:19.572 --> 20:22.023
against our client, Mrs. Dubois.

20:22.091 --> 20:23.958
I don't see
as we had much choice.

20:24.026 --> 20:25.710
Well, then I assume
that you've explained

20:25.795 --> 20:28.129
to Mr. Amenabar the
reason for which

20:28.197 --> 20:29.898
he's being deposed
this morning.

20:29.965 --> 20:32.267
It's in respect to a new
charge of kidnapping,

20:32.334 --> 20:33.535
unrelated to any of those

20:33.602 --> 20:36.037
for which you're already
being prosecuted.

20:36.105 --> 20:38.256
Amelia Cready.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.642
Her father is Steven
Cready of Cready Oil.

20:40.709 --> 20:44.546
Two years ago Amelia was
kidnapped and held for ransom.

20:44.613 --> 20:45.980
Per her kidnapper's request,

20:46.048 --> 20:49.050
her father wired $2 million
to an offshore account

20:49.118 --> 20:51.586
and awaited his
daughter's safe return.

20:51.687 --> 20:55.690
All he got for his money was
the location of her body.

20:55.741 --> 20:59.861
Now, last night I received
an anonymous tip--

20:59.929 --> 21:01.496
Ah, anonymous.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.264
Mm.

21:03.332 --> 21:05.567
--that you were the one
who ordered the kidnapping.

21:05.634 --> 21:10.538
I am sorry, I've never heard
of this girl or her father.

21:13.042 --> 21:17.278
Well, Mr. Amenabar,
let's just pretend that you did.

21:17.346 --> 21:18.546
Okay.

21:18.614 --> 21:21.616
So this person who contacted us
also told us

21:21.684 --> 21:23.785
the name of the man
who actually kidnapped Amelia.

21:23.853 --> 21:26.254
We know what he looks like,
we have a picture of him.

21:26.322 --> 21:28.289
We just don't know
where to find him.

21:28.357 --> 21:31.125
Now if you
are willing

21:31.193 --> 21:33.228
to identify him,

21:33.295 --> 21:36.097
tell us everything
that you know about him,

21:36.165 --> 21:38.132
we might be willing

21:38.200 --> 21:40.501
to not add this
to the list of charges

21:40.603 --> 21:42.237
against you.

21:42.288 --> 21:45.240
Why don't you take a look?

21:59.321 --> 22:02.223
Gentleman, let me have a moment
alone with Mrs. Dubois, please.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.893
Mr. Amenabar, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.561
There's guards
right outside the door.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.030
You feel safe,
don't you, Mrs. Dubois?

22:28.918 --> 22:30.184
Lawyers.
Hmm.

22:32.187 --> 22:33.454
Do you play much poker?

22:33.522 --> 22:35.556
No.

22:35.624 --> 22:38.159
That's a shame,
because something tells me

22:38.227 --> 22:40.428
that you'd be very good
at it if you did.

22:40.496 --> 22:43.331
Mr. Amenabar, do you know the
man in this picture or not?

22:43.399 --> 22:44.799
Ah.

22:44.850 --> 22:47.101
You see what you just did,
looking away?

22:47.169 --> 22:49.037
In poker, we call that a tell.

22:49.104 --> 22:50.571
I know what a tell is.

22:50.639 --> 22:52.140
And you did
the same thing to me

22:52.191 --> 22:54.509
when you were telling me
all about the crime

22:54.576 --> 22:56.811
that this man committed.

22:56.879 --> 23:00.181
It was almost as if
you didn't believe it yourself.

23:00.249 --> 23:02.150
I wonder why that is.

23:02.217 --> 23:04.485
Maybe it's just because
I don't like looking at you.

23:04.553 --> 23:06.120
Nah.

23:06.188 --> 23:08.389
It's not that.

23:08.457 --> 23:10.591
I think it's something else.

23:10.659 --> 23:13.127
I think, Mrs. Dubois,

23:13.195 --> 23:15.129
that maybe...

23:15.197 --> 23:17.665
you're the one
who knows this man.

23:17.733 --> 23:20.568
Can you tell me
where to find him, or can't you?

23:20.636 --> 23:22.770
<i>If</i> I could,

23:22.838 --> 23:25.106
I don't think
either of us really believe

23:25.174 --> 23:28.209
that you're looking
to arrest this man for murder.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.514
Huh.

23:33.582 --> 23:35.917
You know, now
that I take another look...

23:35.985 --> 23:37.986
he does seem familiar.

23:41.156 --> 23:43.691
Get me my extradition to Mexico,

23:43.759 --> 23:46.461
and I'll tell you
exactly what you want to know.

23:46.528 --> 23:49.564
Excuse me.
Just yesterday, you sat there,

23:49.631 --> 23:52.467
and you told me this business
with Joe would not interfere

23:52.534 --> 23:54.752
with your ability
to prosecute the Amenabar case.

23:54.837 --> 23:56.471
Now you're saying
that we should take the deal

23:56.538 --> 23:57.638
his people are offering?

23:57.706 --> 23:59.640
I thought you understood.

23:59.708 --> 24:03.511
I saw my husband
in a Mexican hospital <i>alive.</i>

24:03.579 --> 24:05.646
He has amnesia.

24:05.714 --> 24:07.315
Amenabar paid a crooked cop

24:07.383 --> 24:09.484
to bring him Joe
when he was released.

24:09.551 --> 24:11.853
Okay, in the first place,
you didn't see it.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.021
You dreamt it.

24:13.088 --> 24:14.789
And in the second place,
why, Allison?

24:14.857 --> 24:16.591
Please explain to me
why the head

24:16.658 --> 24:19.327
of a Mexican drug cartel
would buy a man with amnesia?

24:19.395 --> 24:20.628
Any man, much less Joe?

24:20.696 --> 24:22.630
I don't know!
I just know that he did it.

24:22.698 --> 24:25.233
I could see it in his eyes
when I saw him this morning.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.834
This morning
when you fabricated the story

24:26.902 --> 24:29.303
about us bringing an additional
charge against him.

24:29.371 --> 24:31.406
Do you realize you could have
put our entire case in jeopardy?

24:31.473 --> 24:34.375
My <i>husband</i> is alive!

24:34.443 --> 24:37.311
And that is <i>all</i>
that matters now!

24:37.379 --> 24:38.746
Listen to yourself, Allison.

24:38.814 --> 24:41.015
It doesn't make any sense.

24:41.083 --> 24:43.851
Joe survives a plane crash
from seven years ago?

24:43.919 --> 24:45.520
He drifts to Mexico?

24:45.587 --> 24:47.088
He crosses paths

24:47.156 --> 24:48.489
with Luis Amenabar,

24:48.557 --> 24:50.091
the same man
you're prosecuting today?

24:50.159 --> 24:52.193
I know how it sounds.

24:52.261 --> 24:54.996
No, I don't think you do.

24:55.064 --> 24:57.932
Did it ever occur to you
that Amenabar is playing you?

24:57.983 --> 24:59.567
The man runs
an organization larger

24:59.635 --> 25:01.536
than most Fortune 500 companies.

25:01.603 --> 25:03.004
He's no fool.

25:03.072 --> 25:05.606
You said that you
could see in his eyes

25:05.674 --> 25:06.841
that he knew Joe.

25:06.909 --> 25:08.876
What do you think he sees
in <i>your</i> eyes?

25:08.944 --> 25:10.411
Don't you think that maybe,
just maybe,

25:10.479 --> 25:12.447
that Amenabar knows
that Joe means something to you?

25:12.514 --> 25:13.781
Don't you think
that it's possible

25:13.849 --> 25:15.983
that he's just telling you
what you want to hear?

25:16.051 --> 25:18.352
He's not telling me
what I want to hear.

25:18.420 --> 25:20.555
He's confirming what I know.

25:20.622 --> 25:22.924
I saw Joe yesterday.

25:22.991 --> 25:26.561
I saw him when I looked
at Amenabar in court.

25:26.628 --> 25:29.063
Because they're connected.

25:29.098 --> 25:32.400
Because Amenabar can lead me
to Joe.

25:32.468 --> 25:34.402
No, he can't,

25:34.470 --> 25:36.938
and I won't make this deal.

25:39.808 --> 25:41.809
Mr. Knox, you kept

25:41.877 --> 25:44.812
the books for the Sola de Vega
cartel, is that correct?

25:44.880 --> 25:46.314
Uh, that's right.

25:46.381 --> 25:48.015
And during the time

25:48.083 --> 25:49.851
that you were acting
as their accountant,

25:49.918 --> 25:52.420
you were frequently asked
to enter expenses under

25:52.488 --> 25:54.088
the miscellaneous supplies
category.

25:54.156 --> 25:55.756
Is that right?

25:55.824 --> 25:57.492
Uh, yes.

25:57.543 --> 25:59.494
And yet, you understood

25:59.545 --> 26:01.546
that those expenses
were for something other

26:01.630 --> 26:03.598
than miscellaneous supplies,
didn't you?

26:07.169 --> 26:08.769
You already answered

26:08.837 --> 26:10.338
this question
when we deposed you

26:10.405 --> 26:11.889
in exchange for immunity.

26:11.974 --> 26:14.942
If you prefer,
I could read it into the record.

26:15.010 --> 26:16.544
No.

26:16.612 --> 26:19.780
All of the book entries
were in code.

26:19.848 --> 26:21.516
They had to be that way.

26:21.583 --> 26:22.984
The men I worked for...

26:23.051 --> 26:25.052
they told me that
miscellaneous supplies meant

26:25.120 --> 26:27.688
money they spent
when they had someone murdered.

26:29.091 --> 26:31.742
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

26:34.229 --> 26:36.230
My apologies.

26:37.749 --> 26:40.251
Where did you get this?
Get what?

26:40.335 --> 26:41.435
Counsel, what's going on?

26:41.503 --> 26:42.870
Where is he?
Where's my husband?

26:42.921 --> 26:44.438
- Counsel!
- Where's Joe?!

26:44.506 --> 26:46.807
Counsel,

26:46.875 --> 26:49.310
you will come to order,
or you will be held in contempt.

26:49.378 --> 26:50.778
I'm calling a recess.

26:50.846 --> 26:52.880
I want to see counsel
from both sides

26:52.931 --> 26:54.932
in my chambers
immediately.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.657
Allison,
sorry to ring your bell so late,

27:02.724 --> 27:05.092
but there's something
I need to discuss with you.

27:09.565 --> 27:12.333
You're replacing me
as lead counsel?

27:12.401 --> 27:14.335
Allison...

27:14.403 --> 27:16.337
whatever you're going through,

27:16.405 --> 27:18.339
it's affecting our chances
of convicting Amenabar.

27:18.407 --> 27:21.342
We can't afford another day
like you had today.

27:21.410 --> 27:24.879
But, sir,
Amenabar knows where Joe is.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.248
He showed me a picture of him,
a photograph.

27:27.316 --> 27:28.549
I heard all about it,

27:28.617 --> 27:30.685
but it doesn't prove anything,
Allison.

27:30.752 --> 27:32.353
Amenabar knows
you're vulnerable,

27:32.421 --> 27:34.188
and he's using it
to fluster you.

27:34.256 --> 27:36.290
I've told Judge Malone
we're bringing in new counsel.

27:36.358 --> 27:37.892
She's granted us a 48-hour stay.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.260
I'm sorry.

27:39.328 --> 27:40.528
You've done exceptional work,

27:40.596 --> 27:42.530
but someone else is going
to take it from here.

27:42.598 --> 27:43.698
WOMAN
<i>And a surprising</i>

27:43.765 --> 27:45.866
turn of events in Phoenix today,

27:45.934 --> 27:48.636
as lead prosecutor
in the Luis Amenabar trial,

27:48.687 --> 27:51.572
Allison Dubois,
was asked to step down.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.574
Asked for comment,

27:53.642 --> 27:55.660
Mayor Manuel Devalos
would only say

27:55.744 --> 27:59.413
that the A.D.A. was taking
a leave for personal reasons.

28:13.128 --> 28:14.528
Danny Boy.

28:14.596 --> 28:15.713
<i>¿Qué tal?</i>

28:15.797 --> 28:17.431
Hey, Eduardo.

28:17.499 --> 28:19.383
You made some good time, amigo.
Yeah.

28:19.468 --> 28:21.352
I brought you some tacos.

28:21.436 --> 28:23.271
Oh, no, no.
In case you were hungry?

28:23.338 --> 28:25.973
No, no, it's okay. I got
something on the road, so...

28:26.024 --> 28:28.943
I was just listening
on the radio about Mr. Amenabar.

28:29.010 --> 28:31.812
It sounds like things are going
a little better for him.

28:31.863 --> 28:33.814
Those people in Phoenix--

28:33.882 --> 28:35.750
they don't know what
they're talking about.

28:35.817 --> 28:38.085
Mr. Amenabar is a good man.

28:38.153 --> 28:39.987
If he wasn't,

28:40.038 --> 28:42.390
I would have put him in
jail a long time ago, no?

28:42.457 --> 28:44.125
Yeah.

28:44.192 --> 28:46.744
Are you okay? You look, uh...
you look tired.

28:46.828 --> 28:49.297
No. I'm not tired.

28:49.364 --> 28:51.265
I just...

28:51.333 --> 28:53.934
I was just having a hard time
sleeping last night.

28:54.002 --> 28:56.270
I... I kept having this dream.

28:56.338 --> 28:58.889
This... this blonde woman.

28:58.974 --> 29:02.043
Ah. I had that
dream, amigo.

29:02.110 --> 29:03.761
Yeah.
I know that woman.

29:03.845 --> 29:05.513
It wasn't like that.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.515
No. What was it like?

29:07.566 --> 29:09.583
Ah, I don't know.

29:10.752 --> 29:13.521
It was just nice.

29:13.588 --> 29:16.257
We had a house.

29:16.325 --> 29:20.127
I think we were married, because
there were three daughters.

29:20.195 --> 29:22.863
Three girls that we had.

29:22.931 --> 29:24.932
And they looked like her.

29:26.935 --> 29:28.869
Been having that dream
a lot lately.

29:28.937 --> 29:30.604
Kind of makes me wonder...

29:30.672 --> 29:32.173
About what?

29:32.240 --> 29:35.810
I don't know. About my accident,
my memory loss.

29:37.379 --> 29:38.679
I'm trying to figure out

29:38.747 --> 29:41.048
if maybe she was someone
that I knew before.

29:41.099 --> 29:43.617
Look, I don't know what
to tell you, Danny.

29:43.685 --> 29:45.453
I'm the one who
caught your case

29:45.520 --> 29:47.822
when you washed up on
that shore that day.

29:47.889 --> 29:49.590
And I'm the one
who figured out

29:49.658 --> 29:52.827
that you worked for Mr.
Amenabar before you got hurt.

29:52.894 --> 29:55.963
So, I probably know more
about you than you do.

29:56.031 --> 29:57.431
Uh.

29:57.499 --> 29:59.600
I'm going to tell
you right now.

29:59.668 --> 30:02.636
You ain't never
been with no blonde.

30:02.704 --> 30:05.373
You sure as hell
don't have no family.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.122
Allison.

30:23.175 --> 30:24.792
It's 6:30 in the morning.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.293
What are you doing here? I...

30:26.361 --> 30:28.896
I thought we both agreed
you'd take a little time off.

30:28.963 --> 30:30.865
We did. And I am.

30:30.932 --> 30:32.666
Joe's alive.

30:32.734 --> 30:35.269
I met with Luis Amenabar.
He confirmed it.

30:35.337 --> 30:37.438
You met with Amenabar?

30:37.506 --> 30:38.773
He's been using Joe

30:38.840 --> 30:40.975
as a drug mule
for the last seven years.

30:41.042 --> 30:43.411
A friendly American face
that can go back and forth

30:43.478 --> 30:46.213
across the Mexican border
without arousing suspicion.

30:46.281 --> 30:47.982
Joe doesn't understand.

30:48.049 --> 30:50.951
He thinks he's just been
running errands for Amenabar.

30:51.019 --> 30:52.386
He doesn't realize

30:52.454 --> 30:54.321
those cars are filled
with compartments

30:54.389 --> 30:56.090
that hold narcotics.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.259
I see.

30:58.326 --> 31:01.695
Now, assuming all of this
is true, why do you think

31:01.763 --> 31:04.432
Amenabar would suddenly be
so forthcoming about Joe?

31:08.670 --> 31:10.738
Sir, I came here

31:10.806 --> 31:14.275
because I wanted to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.

31:14.342 --> 31:18.179
You have always been
a good friend to me,

31:18.246 --> 31:21.449
and I'm very grateful,
and I wanted you to know that.

31:22.684 --> 31:23.951
Allison.

31:24.019 --> 31:26.620
You haven't answered
my question.

31:26.688 --> 31:28.572
Why would Amenabar tell you
about Joe?

31:28.657 --> 31:30.624
Take care of yourself, sir.

31:32.744 --> 31:34.829
Allison!

31:40.218 --> 31:41.402
Allison!

31:41.470 --> 31:42.553
Hello?

31:42.637 --> 31:44.922
How far away
from City Hall are you?

31:45.006 --> 31:47.174
I'm right... I'm right outside.
What's going on, Lynn?

31:47.242 --> 31:49.042
Well, apparently,
Allison Dubois had a meeting

31:49.094 --> 31:51.178
with Amenabar and his attorneys
late last night.

31:51.246 --> 31:53.247
She agreed
to the extradition deal.

31:53.315 --> 31:56.016
Her only condition was that
she get a five-minute meeting

31:56.067 --> 31:57.518
with Amenabar in private.

31:57.586 --> 31:59.420
It's over, Manny.

31:59.488 --> 32:01.956
They're flying him to Mexico
this afternoon.

32:02.023 --> 32:04.575
She torpedoed the case.

32:16.313 --> 32:17.514
<i>Are really going</i>
<i>to do this?</i>

32:17.610 --> 32:19.970
Are you really gonna not
talk to me the whole way?

32:20.020 --> 32:21.253
Just don't, okay?

32:21.321 --> 32:22.871
Don't what?

32:22.956 --> 32:24.823
Don't act like
this is just some road trip

32:24.874 --> 32:28.127
and everything is totally
normal, because it's not.

32:28.194 --> 32:31.230
You threw away your career
this morning.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.916
You threw away your life.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.300
You threw away my life.

32:35.368 --> 32:37.086
My friends. My school.

32:37.170 --> 32:38.370
Why would you do that?

32:38.438 --> 32:40.606
I did it to save our family.

32:40.674 --> 32:43.175
Yeah. You just keep
telling yourself that.

You have to wake up now.

I'm sorry.

You got confused.

the one I was taking
back from Hawaii,

35:57.570 --> 36:00.706
something went wrong
with one of the engines.

36:05.745 --> 36:09.147
No.

No, no.
No, this is... That's...

36:11.317 --> 36:12.584
This isn't right.

36:12.652 --> 36:13.986
This... That can't be right.

36:14.053 --> 36:15.153
It is.

36:15.221 --> 36:17.122
I didn't make it, Allison.

36:17.190 --> 36:19.291
None of us made it.

36:19.359 --> 36:20.726
I'm so sorry.

36:20.793 --> 36:23.328
Stop saying that.

36:23.396 --> 36:25.364
Do you hear me?

36:25.431 --> 36:26.698
I-I want to wake up now.

36:26.766 --> 36:29.034
I want to wake up
and find you beside me.

36:29.102 --> 36:30.202
I want to hold you.

36:30.270 --> 36:33.238
I'd like that, too,

36:33.306 --> 36:36.208
but you're not going to
wake up from this, Allison.

36:36.276 --> 36:37.743
This isn't a dream.

36:37.810 --> 36:40.979
The dream was everything
you just went through.

36:46.135 --> 36:47.686
No!

36:47.754 --> 36:50.589
I sent it to you.

36:50.657 --> 36:54.893
I was trying to show you
how things could be.

36:54.961 --> 36:57.429
I was trying to show you
that, in spite of this,

36:57.497 --> 36:59.731
you could still have
an amazing life.

36:59.799 --> 37:01.600
That you could
be a lawyer.

37:01.668 --> 37:04.436
That the girls could
turn out great.

37:04.504 --> 37:07.773
I wanted you to see
how happy you could be,

37:07.840 --> 37:10.609
but something happened.

37:10.677 --> 37:12.978
You took over somehow.

37:14.681 --> 37:17.182
Even in a dream, you couldn't
accept that I was gone,

37:17.250 --> 37:18.850
so you brought
me back to life.

37:18.918 --> 37:21.687
You, Allison.

37:21.754 --> 37:23.722
You made it so that
you'd find me in Mexico.

37:23.790 --> 37:27.359
You made it so that we
could be together again.

37:27.427 --> 37:29.428
But we can't.

37:29.495 --> 37:31.964
Because things like that
only happen in dreams.

37:35.134 --> 37:37.369
This is going
to be hard.

37:37.437 --> 37:38.887
This is going
to be awful,

37:38.972 --> 37:41.273
and it's going to be
awful for a long time,

37:41.341 --> 37:43.475
but you will get past it.

37:43.543 --> 37:47.646
Everything we have
built, our life,

37:47.714 --> 37:50.082
you'll keep it
going without me.

37:51.918 --> 37:54.286
I can't. I can't.

37:55.755 --> 37:58.924
I need you, Joe.

37:58.992 --> 38:03.228
Who's gonna walk Ariel down the
aisle when she gets married?

38:05.465 --> 38:09.167
Who's gonna get Bridgette and
Marie through being teenagers?

38:10.236 --> 38:11.770
Who's going to...

38:11.838 --> 38:15.874
Who's going to talk to me
at night before I fall asleep?

38:20.179 --> 38:23.181
You and me...

38:23.249 --> 38:27.552
we've been together
for-for so long

38:27.620 --> 38:30.922
I don't even know if there
is a "me" without you.

38:30.990 --> 38:34.059
There is.

38:34.127 --> 38:36.361
I'm not just saying that.

38:36.429 --> 38:37.996
I've seen it.

38:45.972 --> 38:48.073
I love you, Allison.

38:48.141 --> 38:50.842
I'll always love you.

38:50.910 --> 38:52.477
Never forget that.

38:52.545 --> 38:56.114
Please, my love.

38:56.182 --> 38:58.116
Please. I love you.
Don't leave me.

38:58.184 --> 38:59.985
Please!

39:00.053 --> 39:02.654
Please, please!

39:02.722 --> 39:06.024
Don't leave me. Please stay.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.667
GIRL
Hi, Great-Grandma.

39:15.735 --> 39:17.803
It's me. Glimmer.

39:17.870 --> 39:21.173
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.875
Do you remember
what I look like?

39:25.778 --> 39:27.746
I worry you won't know it's me,

39:27.797 --> 39:32.084
'cause I'm taller now.

39:32.151 --> 39:34.086
How's the weather there?

39:34.153 --> 39:37.689
It's cold here.

39:37.757 --> 39:40.959
Every time it snows,

39:41.010 --> 39:43.962
Mommy laughs.

39:44.013 --> 39:48.433
She says when she was my age,
she would dream about snow.

39:48.501 --> 39:53.305
Did Mommy tell you I'm having a
Sleeping Beauty birthday party?

39:53.372 --> 39:55.674
All my friends are going
to sleep over,

39:55.741 --> 39:58.643
and we're going to have
birthday cake for breakfast.

40:00.213 --> 40:02.781
Do you think
you'll be able to come?

40:04.200 --> 40:05.250
You can help me blow out...

40:22.051 --> 40:24.970
Oh, no.

40:37.350 --> 40:39.351
Hi.

40:46.425 --> 40:48.326
You waited.

40:50.163 --> 40:53.632
Of course.

40:53.699 --> 40:55.634
You ready?

41:00.706 --> 41:02.741
Do I get a kiss?

41:07.647 --> 41:11.049
From now until
the end of time.
