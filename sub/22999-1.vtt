01:22.663 --> 01:24.207
What the...

02:20.502 --> 02:24.342
Which one of you chicken-shits
shot that fella in the back?

02:54.654 --> 02:56.231
Hey!

03:05.664 --> 03:06.850
Reckon that's enough.

03:14.839 --> 03:16.534
Lefty...

03:16.614 --> 03:19.426
...ain't you a little gray
to be making these mistakes?

03:20.746 --> 03:22.391
There you go.

03:22.982 --> 03:25.861
Never can please you, now, can I?

03:27.686 --> 03:29.532
Hard of hearing, son?

03:37.396 --> 03:38.885
I give up.

03:38.965 --> 03:40.809
You ain't gonna shoot?

03:41.433 --> 03:42.678
Yep.

04:08.826 --> 04:13.053
All's I'm saying is that you can't just go
and throw a rope around a man's neck...

04:13.133 --> 04:14.855
...whenever the hell it pleases you.

04:14.935 --> 04:16.946
It don't ever please me.

04:35.921 --> 04:40.002
One hell of a way to start
your career, Mr. Senator.

04:45.397 --> 04:50.023
I still can't believe he'd shoot a man
over a $2.00 hand of poker.

04:50.563 --> 04:52.725
Don't you say nothing to Laura.

04:52.805 --> 04:56.062
You know how she feels
about me still acting the lawman.

04:56.856 --> 05:00.569
Edward, she don't listen to me, anyway.

05:04.383 --> 05:05.961
Mr. Johnson.

05:32.194 --> 05:36.461
Don't you worry none.
I'll tend to the horses for you.

05:44.690 --> 05:47.013
"Can carry the coffin,
but the corpse will walk."

05:47.093 --> 05:48.537
No.

05:51.497 --> 05:53.108
Oak, I raise you.

05:56.668 --> 06:00.693
Be the day when I don't have
to bunk with the like of you boys.

06:01.073 --> 06:04.697
Mr. Johnson already said
he's not taking you to Washington.

06:04.777 --> 06:08.378
Washington? Who said
anything about Washington?

06:09.181 --> 06:11.310
I'm talking about the two-story.

06:13.152 --> 06:16.075
What on God's green Earth
are you gonna do with a family house?

06:16.455 --> 06:18.667
What the hell do you think?

06:21.661 --> 06:23.939
Everybody's gotta have a dream.

06:27.732 --> 06:29.556
It ain't up for debate.

06:29.636 --> 06:33.661
You leave Lefty in charge of our ranch,
the place won't be here when we return.

06:34.141 --> 06:37.263
All right. I'll bring him with us.

06:37.343 --> 06:39.632
You will do no such thing.

06:39.712 --> 06:41.434
A senator needs a good aide.

06:41.514 --> 06:44.672
Edward Johnson, don't even joke on this.
I need my peace and quiet.

06:44.752 --> 06:48.046
I surrender. I surrender. Oh, my goodness.

06:48.821 --> 06:50.432
Arms down.

06:51.957 --> 06:55.415
Now, Lefty'll run this ranch just fine.

06:55.795 --> 06:58.852
You know he's ridden
with me 40 years now, and...

06:58.932 --> 07:00.587
So has your horse.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.190
We talk on everything else.

07:04.170 --> 07:07.060
Don't know why you're being
so stubborn about this.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.929
Nobody here is gonna listen to him.

07:10.409 --> 07:13.866
A more loyal man than Lefty Brown
hasn't walked this Earth.

07:13.946 --> 07:17.503
Loyal isn't the same as capable.
We need someone like Tom Harrah.

07:18.083 --> 07:21.274
Well, if'n I'm gonna
take on all of Washington...

07:21.354 --> 07:25.033
...I need a fella I can trust
back here at the home front...

07:26.024 --> 07:28.648
...and a fine woman by my side.

07:29.428 --> 07:31.317
You flatter all you want, Mr. Johnson.

07:31.397 --> 07:34.642
Don't change the fact
that I have a needle and you don't.

07:35.001 --> 07:36.865
That's not fair.

07:47.846 --> 07:49.248
Come on.

07:51.516 --> 07:54.596
Damn post, what'd I ever do to you?

08:09.067 --> 08:10.489
Who won?

08:10.569 --> 08:15.328
Well, seeing as it's standing firm,
but I'm still lying in the dirt...

08:15.408 --> 08:17.493
...I guess I'd call it a draw.

08:18.811 --> 08:20.667
You'll whip it yet. Come on.

08:20.747 --> 08:25.752
Of course I will. I ain't ever let you down.
I'm too old to change my ways now.

08:26.952 --> 08:28.741
I know that.

08:28.821 --> 08:30.977
- Do know that?
- Yep.

08:31.857 --> 08:35.148
I also know that roundup's approa
