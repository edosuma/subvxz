09:36.641 --> 09:39.609

09:39.644 --> 09:41.644

09:45.149 --> 09:46.783
[Knock on door]

09:46.817 --> 09:49.952
- [Sighs]
- Geez, mom. It's just the door.

09:49.987 --> 09:52.121
I'll get it.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.455
<i>[Laughter]</i>

09:53.490 --> 09:55.658
<i>[Chatter continues]</i>

09:59.562 --> 10:01.363
Who is it?

10:01.398 --> 10:03.766
- It's Daniel.
- It's Daniel?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.634
Stay right there.

10:12.141 --> 10:15.610
We should take this outside.

10:15.644 --> 10:19.281
I'll be right back, sweetie.

10:19.315 --> 10:21.116
[Sighs] I heard you were fired.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.383
April, they haven't found Paul.

10:22.418 --> 10:25.220
They found his car in a motel in Fresno.

10:25.254 --> 10:27.388
Now, either he was in a hurry,
or he got taken. I don't know.

10:27.423 --> 10:29.390
Taken?

10:29.425 --> 10:32.460
- Your life may be in danger, yours and Lucy's.
- What? Why?

10:32.494 --> 10:34.495
Olivos now knows you've
been talking to the feds.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.897
Oh, my God.

10:36.932 --> 10:38.399
Okay, it's his M.O. To get rid of outsiders

10:38.434 --> 10:39.900
that know details about his operations.

10:39.935 --> 10:42.737
- I mean, he is brutal.
- I've seen pictures.

10:42.771 --> 10:44.706
- [Sighs]
- I know that you felt violated

10:44.740 --> 10:46.207
when the bureau was watching you,

10:46.241 --> 10:48.209
but at least then you had protection.

10:48.243 --> 10:50.177
No one's protecting you now.

10:50.212 --> 10:52.579
Except for you?

10:52.613 --> 10:54.815
I know I haven't earned your trust.

10:54.850 --> 10:57.117
Just tell me what to do.

10:58.854 --> 10:59.920
[Crickets chirping]

10:59.955 --> 11:01.621
[Keys jingle]

11:04.659 --> 11:06.793
Okay. Come on in.

11:06.828 --> 11:10.296
Awesome. Isn't is awesome, mom?

11:10.331 --> 11:13.633
April: It's, uh, cozy.

11:13.668 --> 11:16.503
I'm so glad you guys decided
to give it another shot,

11:16.537 --> 11:17.671
and I promise I'll give you guys

11:17.705 --> 11:19.505
some alone time if you want this weekend.

11:19.539 --> 11:22.108
Oh, I don't know about all that, sweetie.

11:22.142 --> 11:25.278
Hey, Lucy. Check that out.
Called a potbelly stove.

11:25.312 --> 11:28.948
Cool. It burns wood!

11:30.885 --> 11:34.354
Enough room for our stuff?

11:34.388 --> 11:38.758
Yeah. Uh, plenty. [Chuckles]

11:39.826 --> 11:44.463
Hey! Um, why don't you
go and find our bedroom?

11:44.498 --> 11:45.631
Okay.

11:45.665 --> 11:46.799
[Sighs]

11:49.536 --> 11:51.504
I thought you said we were safe here.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.438
We're safer with my gun.

11:53.472 --> 11:56.108
Lucy: There's a fireplace
in here, too! Come see it!

11:56.142 --> 11:57.109
[Chuckles]

11:57.143 --> 11:59.677
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:59.712 --> 12:01.679
<i>Joss: You've reached Josslyn
carver and events by Josslyn.</i>

12:01.714 --> 12:04.616
<i>Please leave a message
at the beep and party on.</i>

12:04.650 --> 12:06.451
<i>- [Beep]
- Hey, Joss, it's me again.</i>

12:06.485 --> 12:09.621
Uh... Could you please
just give me a call back

12:09.655 --> 12:11.956
so that we can talk, okay?

12:11.990 --> 12:13.090
Thanks.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.294
[Sighs]

12:16.328 --> 12:17.962
[Knock on door]

12:17.996 --> 12:20.965
Oh... [sighs]

12:20.999 --> 12:22.500
[Inhales sharply]

12:24.570 --> 12:27.571
You got a sec?

12:30.442 --> 12:32.609
Yep.

12:36.081 --> 12:37.248
Karen!

12:40.652 --> 12:43.454
[Sighs]

12:43.488 --> 12:45.322
You want to come in?

12:48.125 --> 12:49.426
[Sighs]

12:49.461 --> 12:51.428
Cold one?

12:51.463 --> 12:54.264
Hmm? No. No, just, uh...
you go right ahead, though.

12:57.969 --> 12:59.436
This is weird.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.972
Um, I don't know how to say
this, but you and Joss...

13:02.006 --> 13:05.976
actually you and Savi...
but you and Joss were family.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.345
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:10.281 --> 13:12.115
Uh...

13:14.118 --> 13:15.417
Her mother's killing me, brother.

13:15.452 --> 13:17.553
Her mum?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.388
Yeah! I mean, you know,

13:19.422 --> 13:21.757
she hasn't R.S.V.P'd to
the engagement party.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.668
You know, I've written. I've
e-mailed. I've called. I get nothing.

13:23.668 --> 13:25.271
[Chuckles] Right.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.896
Good, old Janet. She is flaky.

13:26.930 --> 13:29.665
It's... it's not personal, Scott.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.033
Well, it is to Joss.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.235
Truth is, if it were
just an engagement party,

13:33.269 --> 13:35.404
I don't think I'd be sweating it so much,

13:35.438 --> 13:36.738
but the thing is, I'm, uh, you know...

13:36.772 --> 13:38.173
I'm gonna surprise her with a wedding.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.175
I know. [Chuckles] I know.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.677
Look. It sounds completely insane, right?

13:42.712 --> 13:45.180
But this whole engagement's
got her all stressed-out, right?

13:45.215 --> 13:47.649
And why wouldn't it? I mean,
she plans parties for a living.

13:47.683 --> 13:50.485
The last thing she needs is for
her own wedding to feel like work.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.920
Plus, you know, quite frankly,

13:51.954 --> 13:53.855
I can't stand not being married
to her for another minute.

13:53.890 --> 13:56.457
It's like when you find the
right one, you know, you just...

13:56.492 --> 13:57.859
uh, w-why you telling me this, Scott?

13:57.894 --> 14:01.530
Right. Um, 'cause I need
your advice on something.

14:01.564 --> 14:03.031
Um...

14:03.065 --> 14:06.434
The girls... Savi, Karen, April...

14:06.468 --> 14:07.601
do I tell them what I have planned?

14:07.636 --> 14:09.170
'Cause Janet's got me freaking out, man,

14:09.204 --> 14:10.671
and I just want to make sure

14:10.705 --> 14:12.740
that, you know, Joss' key people show up.

14:12.774 --> 14:16.911
Yeah, well... I-I-I think if you really

14:16.945 --> 14:19.547
want it to be romantic, you know, um,

14:19.581 --> 14:21.381
effortless for her,

14:21.416 --> 14:23.551
do not tell them. [Chuckles]

14:23.585 --> 14:26.053
Her ladies cannot keep a
secret to save their lives,

14:26.087 --> 14:28.889
but they... they will show up for her.

14:28.924 --> 14:30.257
They always do.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.259
Well, yeah, no, that's...
that's... that's real good.

14:32.293 --> 14:33.928
That's good stuff. I... you...

14:33.962 --> 14:34.763
- You are a pal.
- Thanks.

14:34.763 --> 14:35.368
Yeah.

14:35.797 --> 14:37.764
Or what is it they say down under... mate?

14:37.798 --> 14:39.199
Yeah. Mate. [Chuckles]

14:39.233 --> 14:40.767
You're a real mate. All right?

14:40.801 --> 14:42.269
Thank you.

14:42.303 --> 14:44.971
- No worries.
- Um...

14:45.005 --> 14:46.540
We'll see you at the wedding?

14:46.574 --> 14:47.874
Oh, for... for sure.

14:47.908 --> 14:49.543
All right. Thanks again.

14:49.577 --> 14:53.046
[Door opens]

14:53.081 --> 14:55.147
[Door closes]

15:06.229 --> 15:07.297
[Sighs]

15:08.330 --> 15:10.631
I want to be sober for this.

15:10.665 --> 15:11.925
You care if I get drunk?

15:14.003 --> 15:15.770
How could you lie to me, Ben,

15:15.804 --> 15:17.738
misrepresent yourself like that?

15:17.773 --> 15:19.040
Sleep with me,

15:19.074 --> 15:21.475
then tell me you sleep
with hookers all the time?!

15:21.510 --> 15:23.611
<i>I don't know, Rebecca.</i>

15:23.645 --> 15:25.379
Don't pretend it's the same thing.

15:25.414 --> 15:28.181
You slept with random men.
And was careful every time.

15:28.216 --> 15:29.750
<i>Not the whole time every time.</i>

15:31.520 --> 15:33.487
If only I hadn't met you.

15:33.522 --> 15:35.656
You were fine with my
history when I first told you.

15:35.690 --> 15:37.657
That was before you infected me, Ben.

15:37.691 --> 15:40.493
What?

15:40.528 --> 15:41.861
No, did you get the results?

15:41.896 --> 15:45.032
Not yet, but I have it.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.699
I know I do.

15:46.734 --> 15:47.801
Of course I do!

15:47.835 --> 15:48.868
Don't say that.

15:48.903 --> 15:52.439
Don't do that! Don't comfort me! Please!

15:53.507 --> 15:55.642
[Voice breaking] I'm not looking for you

15:55.676 --> 16:00.146
to convince me otherwise.
I'm telling you the facts.

16:00.180 --> 16:05.552
Everything I've done to find love...

16:05.586 --> 16:08.888
Everything I touch...

16:08.923 --> 16:13.892
It all ends in death. [Exhales shakily]

16:13.927 --> 16:14.994
[Sighs]

16:15.028 --> 16:17.563
[Sighs] Don't leave.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.731
[Sighs]

16:19.766 --> 16:22.101
Take care of yourself, Ben.

16:24.838 --> 16:27.138
[Exhales sharply]

16:27.173 --> 16:28.774
Okay, sweetheart. Come on.

16:28.808 --> 16:31.276
[Whirring, sputtering]

16:31.310 --> 16:33.512
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on!

16:33.546 --> 16:35.013
- Oh...
- [Thud]

16:35.047 --> 16:37.349
Yep, that's about right. [Sighs]

16:37.383 --> 16:38.617
[Knock on door]

16:38.651 --> 16:41.520
[Groans] What in God's name do you want?!

16:41.554 --> 16:44.189
[Dog barking in distance]

16:44.223 --> 16:46.358
- Savi.
- Hi.

16:46.392 --> 16:49.027
Uh, this clearly isn't a good time,

16:49.061 --> 16:50.428
so I'll just come back another time.

16:50.463 --> 16:52.263
- Uh, what... what are you doing here?
- What?

16:52.298 --> 16:55.266
Okay... uh, d-do you mind if
Do you mind if I just...?

16:55.301 --> 16:58.103
No, no, no. Go ahea...
go ahead. It's... Hot.

16:58.137 --> 17:00.104
Yep. [Sighs]

17:00.138 --> 17:01.939
Yeah.

17:01.974 --> 17:05.075
Uh... I don't know how to
say this, and I know

17:05.109 --> 17:06.711
I probably don't have a right to say it

17:06.744 --> 17:09.179
after everything I've done
in the past. But I just...

17:09.214 --> 17:10.214
Ohh!

17:10.248 --> 17:11.516
Oh, my God!

17:11.550 --> 17:13.885
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:13.919 --> 17:15.720
- [Grunts]
- Are you okay?!

17:15.753 --> 17:17.121
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm fine. I'm all right.

17:17.155 --> 17:18.954
Are you s... oh, that's
look, that's the bone.

17:18.990 --> 17:21.790
- Yeah. I'm taking you to the E.R.
- No, I can't.

17:21.826 --> 17:24.461
I-I've been drinking
quite a bit. I can't drive.

17:24.496 --> 17:26.296
Yeah, that's why you can't drive.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.598
[Sighs]

17:28.633 --> 17:30.767
That was... that was definitely a four.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.436
No way! You cheated! That
was three, not a four!

17:32.470 --> 17:34.303
I did not cheat. Look, look,
do you want me to roll again?

17:34.338 --> 17:37.440
I'll do over. Yeah? Sure.
Fine. You're such a che...

17:37.474 --> 17:38.942
uh, you can't just go
Stealing money out of the till.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.443
See, that's why you can't be banker!

17:40.477 --> 17:42.378
- [Giggling]
- That's why you can't be banker!

17:42.413 --> 17:44.814
- I'm telling you. That's why you can't be...
- [Fire cracks]

17:44.849 --> 17:46.683
- [Sighs]
- Uptight much?

17:46.717 --> 17:49.218
You two are perfect for each other.

17:49.253 --> 17:50.753
It was just the fire.

17:53.257 --> 17:55.791
How about we go and watch a movie?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.560
That's a good idea.

17:57.594 --> 17:59.395
I call middle of the bed.

17:59.430 --> 18:02.565
- [Chuckles]
- [Sighs]

18:02.599 --> 18:03.799
Go ahead.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.401
I want to do one last check outside.

18:05.436 --> 18:06.936
Okay.

18:11.274 --> 18:13.909
Babe, I'm telling you, this
house is ridiculous, okay?

18:13.944 --> 18:15.210
It's perfect for the party.

18:15.244 --> 18:16.712
The thing is so close to
the ocean, one high tide,

18:16.746 --> 18:19.715
it's gonna be swept away to
China, and it's big enough

18:19.749 --> 18:22.250
for all of our friends to stay
over, so everybody can drink.

18:22.285 --> 18:23.885
Are you coming to bed?
Just gonna brush my teeth.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.520
- No, don't brush.
- Can I floss?

18:25.555 --> 18:27.722
[Sighs] Scott, what are we doing?

18:27.756 --> 18:29.757
What do you mean?

18:29.792 --> 18:32.160
Are you gonna kill me if we
cancel the engagement party?

18:32.195 --> 18:34.329
Not the engagement, just the party. Please.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.264
It's just... [Sighs]

18:36.299 --> 18:37.899
It's really stressing me out,

18:37.933 --> 18:39.567
not to mention what it's
gonna cost, and wouldn't...

18:39.602 --> 18:42.036
wouldn't you rather just slip off
to Cabo, the two of us?

18:42.071 --> 18:44.672
I love Cabo. I think Cabo's great,
but we can afford to do both.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.441
Yeah, but there, I don't
have to face people.

18:47.476 --> 18:49.010
Which people?

18:49.044 --> 18:50.845
Just the one.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.279
Uh, like, um...

18:52.314 --> 18:55.616
Uncle Wilson, for instance,
who carries his own spork

18:55.650 --> 18:57.251
and whistles at girls
through his front teeth.

18:58.786 --> 19:01.422
Babe...

19:01.456 --> 19:02.789
You're totally freaking out.

19:02.824 --> 19:05.159
No, it's... I just did this
whole restaurant opening,

19:05.193 --> 19:07.561
and the wedding planning's
gonna be a whole other year.

19:07.596 --> 19:09.997
And frankly, I'd rather
marriage-plan than wedding-plan.

19:10.031 --> 19:12.833
Wouldn't you rather sit on a
beach and contemplate our future

19:12.867 --> 19:16.169
instead of throwing some catered
cage match for our relatives?
