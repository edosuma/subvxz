WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.037
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.085 --> 00:03.125
They grabbed Trubel.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.672
I tried to stop 'em,
they drugged me.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.315
When I woke up,
Juliette's body was gone

00:06.381 --> 00:07.849
and my mom's head...
They took everything.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.051
Do you have Trubel or not?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.181
I can't say.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.512
You just did.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.144
Want to hold him?
He won't break.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.975
I don't want to raise him
by myself.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.152
He needs as much of you
as he does me.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.025
I don't know if
that's good on either side.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.446
"Occultatum Libera"?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.524
They're coming here.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.531
Translated,
it would mean something like

00:26.610 --> 00:29.409
"free what's hidden"
or "free the hidden."

00:29.488 --> 00:30.956
What the hell does it mean?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.283
It's war.

01:06.858 --> 01:07.984
Come in.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.826
They're almost done.
So am l.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.373
I just have to put Kelly
in the car seat.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.325
I'll get him.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.120
How long have you
lived in this house?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.333
About, uh,
six and a half years.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.050
I never thought
I'd be here forever,

01:27.129 --> 01:30.929
but I didn't know anything about
being a Grimm when I bought it.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.604
Now that I think about it,
you were my first.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.306
First what?

01:37.389 --> 01:39.858
First Woge I ever saw.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.568
Remember that?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.083
You were coming out
of a coffee shop.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.355
I was with Hank.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.444
You looked at me.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.326
Oh, as I remember it,
you were looking at me.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.873
You scared
the hell out of me.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.371
You scared
the hell out of me, too.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.045
I guess you were
my first as well.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.502
I'd never seen a Grimm before.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.758
Sorry to interrupt.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.086
Can we grab the crib?

02:07.169 --> 02:09.513
Yeah, it's ready.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.344
No, I'll get it. Here.
Oh.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.768
I'll get him in the car.
Thanks.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.846
You ready to go?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.137
Wow.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.811
You kicked ass yesterday.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.938
Yeah,
it was pretty nonstop.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.018
How much did we do?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.319
Check this out.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.563
Oh!

03:08.772 --> 03:11.195
I kicked serious ass
yesterday.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.277
Mmm.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.616
What?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.873
There's just a little...

03:18.949 --> 03:20.121
Just a little too much of...

03:20.200 --> 03:22.703
Catuaba.
I might've doubled dosed.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.209
I can cut that
with some bayberry.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.648
I'm not sure you could
cut that with a chain saw.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.719
Nick!
I can't stop it!

03:38.802 --> 03:40.395
Let go of the gun!

03:44.349 --> 03:45.350
Whoo!

03:45.559 --> 03:47.152
That was close.

03:56.403 --> 04:00.499
I know this is gonna sound
weird, but I miss Juliette.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.505
The old Juliette
before she turned.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.212
I miss that Juliette, too.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.133
But I'm more glad
the bullet missed you.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.308
Mother!

04:20.844 --> 04:23.688
Come back!

04:23.764 --> 04:25.437
Mother! Don't leave us!

04:25.515 --> 04:26.767
Where are you?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.319
Come back!

04:32.981 --> 04:34.198
Mother!

04:44.201 --> 04:45.453
Is she...

04:47.871 --> 04:49.464
Mother's left us.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.092
How could she do this?

04:53.168 --> 04:55.011
We loved her.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.713
Maybe we didn't
love her enough.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.799
I loved her more than enough.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.052
Let's go.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.397
Hurry up, Big John!
Come on!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.367
What the hell?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.372
Miss?

05:26.451 --> 05:27.543
Hey!

05:27.619 --> 05:28.916
You Okay?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.956
Miss?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.131
What do we do?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.254
Oh, my God.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.297
Oh, my God.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.804
We find another mother.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.724
I found a lady here...

06:00.110 --> 06:01.862
So this is home?

06:01.945 --> 06:02.946
Yeah.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.458
It's safe.
Nobody knows where we are.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.292
I can kind of see why.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.458
it looks nicer
on the inside.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.988
So kid-friendly.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.973
It's a little barren,
but I got us enough to start.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.187
Where's your furniture?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.980
It's in storage.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.854
I didn't want anything
from the old house,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.106
I didn't want the movers
to know where we moved.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.028
I don't want anybody
to know where we are.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.980
Good.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.865
Is that the only access?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.194
Well, there's a heavily-bolted
door to the fire escape,

07:23.276 --> 07:26.997
and there's the roof, which you
can only access from here.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.787
And this.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.213
It's not even in
the city plans.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.582
I think it was built
during prohibition.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.919
Leads down to the tunnels
beneath the city,

07:40.001 --> 07:41.924
Shanghai tunnels maybe,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.053
but it's been blocked off.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.102
This room's for you and Kelly.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.066
Aren't we a little exposed?

07:54.599 --> 07:55.646
Not really.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.648
Three inches of solid steel.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.729
Ah.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.032
Well, it's not exactly
charming,

08:02.107 --> 08:04.576
but I do feel safer
than the other place.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.745
After everything
that happened,

08:06.820 --> 08:09.573
I'm not taking any chances
with my son or with you.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.783
Where will you be?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.083
Just down there.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.746
And bathrooms?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.502
Only one, in the corner.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.500
We'll get used to that.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.462
I will need to get a few
things, though, like food.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.553
Use this credit card to get
whatever it is you need.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.010
The entrance code is
on the paper.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.142
This is the key
to the door,

08:33.221 --> 08:36.350
and this is the key to the car
parked next to mine down below.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.480
Juliette's?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.607
It was.
Is that a problem?

08:40.562 --> 08:41.938
No.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.280
Hank?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.703
Yeah, I know where it is.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.951
I can be there in 20 minutes.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.368
If this is where
I'm supposed to ask

08:55.452 --> 08:56.704
what time
you're gonna be home,

08:56.786 --> 08:58.834
don't worry, I won't.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.590
Home sweet home.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.526
It's my fault
Mother got away.

09:29.611 --> 09:34.208
I was on watch, and
I, uh, fell asleep.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.819
It's because of
what we are, isn't it?

10:07.482 --> 10:10.702
Real mothers would never
abandon their children.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.871
No matter what they were.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.954
She got what she deserved.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.011
I don't think
she's doin' so good.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.181
Here, drink this.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.384
Be careful.
It's still hot.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.222
Drink as much as you can, and
then try and get some sleep.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.436
I can't sleep.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.234
It's hard to breathe.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.984
She needs
some real medicine.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.155
We have to take her
to a doctor.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.278
No.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.779
No, they'll send me back.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.532
Big John and me will
go get some medicine

10:52.610 --> 10:54.453
to help stop your cough.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.327
What about the police?

10:56.406 --> 11:00.001
Last time I went into town,
I almost got caught.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.547
We have no choice.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.171
Woman's body reported by
Dennis Bridger, local rancher.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.131
This is him right here.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.215
Did he hither?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.346
Not according to him.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.847
Found her right where she is.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.554
Didn't touch her, called it in,
stuck around till we got here.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.605
Any ID?
Nothing.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.359
Use the IBIS,
run her prints.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.481
No shoes.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.278
Scratches on her feet. She'd
been running a long time.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.447
Big head wound,
marks on her wrists.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.570
Yeah, someone's been
keeping her tied up.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.071
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.700
She's in the system.
Wendy Henley.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.280
Record?
No.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.207
Missing person.
Reported over two years ago.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.162
Let's get the case file,
see what we know.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.958
Check with the DA.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.915
If she signs off on it,
make the arrest.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.250
You got it.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.633
We should catch up.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.056
Yeah.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.728
I was afraid you were dead.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.891
I was afraid you were dead.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.317
I heard they sent Kenneth.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.235
They did.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.906
Seems the police suspected him
of some kind of Jack the Ripper.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.200
Guess he got here at
just the right time.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.902
What are you doing here?

12:15.985 --> 12:18.829
I thought you should know
the King had an accident.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.744
What?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.247
From what I've been told,
he fell out of his helicopter

12:24.327 --> 12:25.874
somewhere over the ocean.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.422
The body has not
yet been found.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.874
Diana was with him.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.083
She's safe.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.292
Don't worry.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.504
She's with friends.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.638
Apparently,
Viktor wasn't too happy

12:35.713 --> 12:37.433
about being replaced
by his cousin, Kenneth.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.602
None too happy with the
King either for doing it.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.600
So Viktor struck
a deal with the Resistance?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.647
A little payback.
They gave them your daughter.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.349
And you took care
of the King.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.276
Let's just say I happened to be on
the helicopter at the same time.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.692
That puts
Viktor on the throne.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.148
For now.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.326
And in case you're wondering, they
haven't found the helicopter either.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.119
Where's my daughter?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.280
I want to see her.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.580
They didn't tell me.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.329
I just wanted you
to know what I did.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.381
How do I contact you?

13:10.456 --> 13:11.924
I'll contact you.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.128
By the way, I was never here,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.133
and you don't know
any of this.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.965
Bit of a cliche,
but such is life.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.496
Hey!
What are you doing?

13:49.579 --> 13:50.922
Stop it.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.297
I swear to God, it's one thing
after another with you.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.844
Hey. Do you want to
go back to foster care?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.092
No.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.595
Then let's get
what we came here for.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.482
Let's go somewhere else.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.520
This was the last time
our victim,

14:13.603 --> 14:15.401
Wendy Henley,
was seen in public.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.107
July 12th, two years ago.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.951
Her husband reported
her missing that night.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.778
You remember that case?
Yeah.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.862
Trail went cold.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.868
There was no body, no
ransom note, no witnesses.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.790
Well, we got a body now.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.745
There's no ID for the girl
in the case report.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.956
Anybody ever ID her?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.633
No, they tried, but there was
no report of a missing kid.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.461
Victim never
comes back to the car.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.093
How long before the
husband reported her missing?

14:41.172 --> 14:42.173
Six hours.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.384
If I recall, the husband was
the primary suspect.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.561
He had no alibi but
was never charged.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.888
Not enough evidence.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.563
No history of
marital problems.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.107
Patrol came back
six hours later,

14:51.182 --> 14:52.662
found her car right
where she left it.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.899
Talk to the husband.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.458
Tell him his wife's body's
been found.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.482
See if you can
get a read on him.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.615
May I help you?

15:07.698 --> 15:09.792
Do you have any
stuff for a cough?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.460
Well,
depends on the cough.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.914
For a wet cough,
I'd suggest eucalyptus.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.296
But if it's a dry cough,
the sandalwood.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.343
Depends on the symptoms.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.968
It's a bad cough, and he can't
really breathe so good.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.970
Well, the strongest thing
I have is goldenseal.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.677
You make a tea with it.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.770
How much is it?

15:29.846 --> 15:31.689
Depends on how much you
need and that depends on...

15:32.890 --> 15:34.437
Oh.
Um, sorry.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.769
It's broken glass.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.024
Don't touch it.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.522
I'll get the broom.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.774
Hey!

15:41.858 --> 15:43.155
I saw that!

15:43.818 --> 15:45.411
Hey! You stole it!

15:45.486 --> 15:46.954
Let go of me!
You're not leaving!

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
No!
I'm calling the police.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.376
Ah!

16:00.793 --> 16:01.965
You're hurting me!

16:02.044 --> 16:03.637
Wait, I need those!

16:03.713 --> 16:05.135
Oh, yeah?
I don't hear you coughing.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.216
It's for my little sister.
Please!

16:07.300 --> 16:08.722
If I had money,
I'd pay for it.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.141
Ah!
I'm gonna let you up.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.598
You try that again,
I'm calling the police.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.395
Where are your parents?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.321
I said,
where are your parents?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.398
I don't have any.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.656
Where do you live?

16:26.027 --> 16:27.074
Nowhere.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.449
Please,
it's for my little sister.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.125
She's really sick.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.462
Don't ever try that again.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.590
Why weren't you scared of me?

16:47.673 --> 16:48.890
I've seen worse.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.469
So I actually got a
couple of extra... Whoa!

16:51.552 --> 16:52.644
Easy!

16:54.597 --> 16:55.769
What happened here?

16:56.557 --> 16:57.604
Sticky fingers.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.481
Shoplifter?
He's getting away!

16:59.560 --> 17:00.561
I got him.

17:00.645 --> 17:01.862
He was an Apgadnieks.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.485
Did he try to hurt you?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.281
He was just
trying to scare me.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.031
Well,
at least you caught him.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.326
I did.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.198
But I let him keep it.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.204
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I'm sorry, uh, what?

17:14.282 --> 17:16.377
He didn't have any money.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.752
I'm not sure that's how a
business is supposed to run.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.673
He said it was for
his little sister.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.171
She has a bad cough.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.549
A little goldenseal,
not the end of the world.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.800
Rosalee...

17:26.878 --> 17:28.597
He doesn't have
any parents.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.970
Sure.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.396
Who wouldn't believe a fine,
young, upstanding Apgadnieks.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.894
Tell you,
two things I know about kids.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.853
One, they are the future
and should be cherished.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.563
Two, they're lying
little bastards.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.273
Are you really that cynical?

17:45.356 --> 17:46.653
Realistic.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.734
What if we decide
to have a couple, huh?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.286
You gonna feel
that way about them?

17:50.361 --> 17:52.864
Oh, no, I was just talking
about kids in general.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.824
You know, not our kids.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.617
I got to go.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.829
Keller's display-watch
popped a wheelie.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.958
I won't be long.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.665
And stop being such a softy,
except to me.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.126
Oh, so the softy thing's
conditional?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.335
Oh, yeah.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.673
You're a softy.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.759
Only for you.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.862
I can't believe it.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.821
I can't believe it.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.493
Is this your wife,
Wendy Henley?

18:31.569 --> 18:33.321
Yes, that's her.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.764
When was the last
time you saw her?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.710
July 12th, two years ago.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.872
The day she disappeared.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.805
Do you have any idea
why she'd be up off that road?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.933
Any friends or
relatives in the area?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.644
Up there? No.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.646
Anyone ever
contact you about her?

19:02.725 --> 19:03.942
No.

19:04.018 --> 19:08.023
Your wife have any exes or people in
her past with a history of violence?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.652
No. No.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.656
I already answered
all these questions before.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.579
They searched my house,
for God's sake!

19:15.655 --> 19:16.998
They searched my office.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.826
They searched
my parents' house.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.628
I didn't kill my Wife!

19:24.288 --> 19:25.335
Sorry.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.675
I just...

19:27.917 --> 19:31.922
I thought
she was dead two years ago.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.184
Where the hell has she been?

19:37.259 --> 19:39.682
Who would do this to her?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.231
She had pretty hair.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.142
Who?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.729
The lady that gave
you the medicine.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.405
Yeah.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.528
She must have been
really scared of you.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.984
She wasn't.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.529
But they're always scared
when they see what we are.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.456
I don't know. Maybe she's
seen others like us.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.581
I mean, I told her Lily was sick
and she just gave it to me.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.661
But why?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.166
I don't know.
Maybe she cared.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.998
Whoa!

20:07.206 --> 20:09.004
Watch where you're going!

20:09.083 --> 20:10.255
I... Forgot.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.836
Pay attention.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.472
Sorry, Peter.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.642
You can't keep
forgetting.

20:20.803 --> 20:24.649
Kelly, you're too young to
appreciate the irony of this,

20:24.724 --> 20:27.853
but the car we're driving belonged
to a woman who tried to kill me.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.356
Of course I tried
to kill her, too.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.817
It was all very complicated.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.573
Adalind?
Yeah?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.996
Remember me? Lane from
Berman, Rautbort?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.698
Of course
I remember you, Lane.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.454
How are you?
Great.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.251
Last I heard
you got snatched up

20:44.326 --> 20:46.328
by some richer-than-God
European firm.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.880
What was it, Switzerland?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.253
Austria.
Austria, right.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.084
And who is this
little dude?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.341
This is my son, Kelly.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.842
Wow. You're married now.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.263
Or not. Whatever.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.514
With a kid.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.016
So who's the lucky dad?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.142
Anyone I know?

21:04.764 --> 21:05.765
No.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.350
Well, family life
agrees with you.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.525
You look great.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.602
Thanks.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.028
So you moved back
to Portland.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.105
Yeah, I did.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.315
Well,
that's perfect timing.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.526
You know, if you ever feel
like coming back to work,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.111
Berman would hire
you in a second.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.241
Really?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.698
Oh, yeah.
Berman hated to lose you.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.617
And just between us,
if you decide to come back,

21:24.700 --> 21:26.373
ask for more money.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.578
He'll pay it.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.793
Thanks, Lane.

21:29.872 --> 21:30.873
Sure.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.300
Well, hopefully
I'll see around.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.888
When are you going to be
done with that clock?

21:41.967 --> 21:44.937
'Cause I want to close up early,
unless you can't get away.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.061
No, no. I can be done in, like,
I don't know, 20 minutes?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.232
That work?

21:49.308 --> 21:50.981
There's a customer.
Want me to call you back?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.937
No, I can hold.
Okay.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.241
Hey, who are you?
Hey.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.905
Lily.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.992
My brother said
you were very nice.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.373
You gave him
my medicine for free.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.250
Your brother? Oh.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.790
Your brother.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.924
He told me you were sick,
but he didn't have any money.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.969
So you care about us?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.430
Well, sure.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.601
Honey, you're not here
all alone are you?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.353
Where's your brother?

22:31.600 --> 22:32.601
Here.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.901
Don't hurt her!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.402
Be careful! Don't hurt her!

22:37.481 --> 22:38.641
- Rosalee!
- Don't hurt her!

22:41.610 --> 22:42.827
Rosalee!

22:43.153 --> 22:44.700
Oh, my God.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.454
Rosalee!

22:50.911 --> 22:52.629
Rosalee!

22:52.705 --> 22:54.252
Husband was
pretty shook up.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.708
Do we suspect him?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.792
Don't think so.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.556
He was pretty shocked
when he saw her body.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.430
No evidence signs of abuse other
than the marks on her wrists.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.625
Rape kit came back negative.

23:02.673 --> 23:03.753
She wasn't emaciated.

23:03.799 --> 23:04.800
Somebody was feeding her.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.723
If she was on foot, she
couldn't have gotten far.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.275
We're checking
the surrounding areas.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.442
Yeah.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.566
Monroe.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.572
Geez, Nick, there you are!
What's wrong?

23:22.651 --> 23:23.652
Something happened
to Rosalee.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.864
I came back to the spice
shop, and she's gone!

23:25.946 --> 23:27.493
Somebody grabbed her, Nick.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.620
I heard it on the phone!

23:28.699 --> 23:30.179
I was talking to her
when it happened!

23:30.200 --> 23:31.668
We're on our way.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.010
You think she'll like it?

23:47.092 --> 23:48.218
Yeah.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.846
She likes us, doesn't she?

24:04.360 --> 24:05.486
It's all right.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.821
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.160
Why are you doing this?

24:09.239 --> 24:10.536
We need you.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.705
Where are you taking me?

24:12.785 --> 24:14.458
Don't be afraid.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.958
Where are you taking me?

24:17.373 --> 24:18.545
Home.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.721
Tell us what happened.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.549
Okay, so, this kid
came into the store,

24:26.632 --> 24:28.259
and apparently
he tried to steal some stuff,

24:28.342 --> 24:29.889
but Rosalee
catches him, right?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.971
But then he says his sister
is sick or whatever,

24:32.054 --> 24:34.682
so she gives him the stuff, lets
him go, but then he came back.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.358
And I was on
the phone with her.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.901
I mean,
I heard the whole thing.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.978
They took her.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.221
There were these other voices,
okay, and they took her!

24:41.271 --> 24:42.944
You have a name of the kid?
No!

24:43.023 --> 24:44.491
Rosalee thought he was
homeless or something.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.863
You know,
she felt sorry for him.

24:45.943 --> 24:46.944
Did she describe him?

24:47.027 --> 24:49.405
No, I saw him when
he tried to escape.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.990
But I didn't get
a very good look at him.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.292
He's, like, a kid. I don't
know, 15, or whatever.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.790
But Rosalee did say that he
woged to scare her, you know,

24:55.869 --> 24:57.709
when he tried to get away,
and he's Apgadnieks.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.669
So I don't know why
they would take her.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.716
All right, the bank down
the street has surveillance.

25:01.792 --> 25:02.884
That's where we start.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.434
We're home.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.440
You can get out now.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.355
This isn't right.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.436
You need to take me back.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.987
We're not taking you back.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.405
This is where you live now.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.920
Hey, did you hear
what I said to you?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.442
You need to get out now.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.526
Get her.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.827
Hey, I tried to help you kids, but
you are now in a lot of trouble.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.955
Try anything, and Big John
here will have to hurt you.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.209
That's not what we want.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.665
They'll be looking for me.

25:40.748 --> 25:44.548
And believe me, you do not
want these people to find you.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.219
You get to sleep
next to me.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.975
Miguel,
help me get this camo up.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.139
I can't reach!

25:49.214 --> 25:50.386
What time did
Rosalee call you?

25:50.466 --> 25:51.592
6232.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.302
All right. We'll start a
few minutes before that.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.602
If these kids are homeless,
there's no way

25:54.678 --> 25:56.271
they got out of the spice
shop without being noticed.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.347
I don't know
about that.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.398
If they're homeless,
maybe they had

25:58.474 --> 26:00.522
a shopping cart they put her in
and covered her up or whatever.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.978
All right, this is
when you got the call.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.234
Nothing of them on the street.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.111
This isn't helping.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.984
That's me!
That's when I got there.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.365
They were all gone by then.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.741
What the hell
are we gonna do?

26:11.820 --> 26:12.912
Okay, run it back.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.160
Play it again.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.920
What? What...
What'd you see?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.589
I'm not sure. Keep going.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.713
There.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.920
Doesn't that look like the
truck from the other footage?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.926
What other footage?
There's other footage?

26:30.005 --> 26:31.973
The Wendy Henley case.
Yeah, pulling it up.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.801
What for?
Who is Wendy Henley?

26:33.884 --> 26:35.807
Missing persons case
from a couple of years ago.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.479
What the hell does that
have to do with Rosalee?

26:37.554 --> 26:38.646
Got it.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.766
Guys, I don't understand...
There.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.969
That's the same truck.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.145
You said the boy told Rosalee
he had a little sister.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.605
Yes.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.734
And there was.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.441
There was a girl's
voice on the phone.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.276
Rosalee was talking
to her.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.327
Could the girl from the Henley
footage be the little sister?

26:52.402 --> 26:53.619
They're using
the girl as bait.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.323
So what, you're saying that
the same kids who took Rosalee

26:56.406 --> 26:57.658
could be
the ones who took her?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.086
Well, what happened to her?

27:03.205 --> 27:04.206
What?

27:04.581 --> 27:07.630
We found her body on the side
of the road this morning.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.677
Oh, my God, you're telling me
they're killers?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.797
We'll put a BOLO out on the truck.
That's not good enough!

27:11.880 --> 27:13.632
Where'd you find the body?
Service road off Highway 30.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.682
Okay,
that's where we start,

27:14.758 --> 27:16.226
but I need her scent.
Whose scent?

27:17.261 --> 27:19.480
The dead woman's.
Where is she?

27:37.781 --> 27:39.499
Got it. Let's go.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.294
I brought you
a blanket.

27:51.545 --> 27:54.014
Sorry, I can't untie you yet.

27:54.089 --> 27:57.684
We've been abandoned by other
mothers we loved before.

27:58.719 --> 28:04.351
Listen, I know this is gonna be
hard at first, but you'll get used to it.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.686
Get used to what?

28:06.768 --> 28:08.190
Being loved.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.272
You don't kidnap loved ones.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.030
I'm just gonna
warn you now, Mother.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.792
If you so much as think of
running out on your children,

28:22.242 --> 28:24.336
I'll find you and
kill you myself.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.460
You're in our world now.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.730
This is where
the body was found.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.061
Okay.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.817
Give me a second.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.532
It's a little stale.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.912
I can smell you
guys here, too.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.212
Oh, yeah.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.790
That's her.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.003
She came from this direction.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.511
Up there.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.267
There's no trail.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.890
Probably fell.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.143
That would explain
the cut on her head.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.188
I've got berries.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.364
Do you like rabbit?

29:34.439 --> 29:35.941
I picked the berries
myself.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.344
Picking berries
is easy.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.656
They don't run away.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.827
I'm the one who
caught the rabbit.

29:39.903 --> 29:40.950
The trap caught
the rabbit.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.281
All you did was skin it.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.331
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.455
She likes my berries
better anyway.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.002
I like to save them
for dessert.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.454
That's 'cause
you're an idiot.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.880
Stop it.
No fighting at dinner.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.584
Aren't you gonna eat?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.136
It's really good, Mother.

29:57.713 --> 29:58.805
Please, Mother.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.427
Come on,
you have to eat something.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.865
Still got it?
Yeah, but there's more.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.992
Same as I picked up on the road.
She wasn't alone.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.324
And it's all coming
from the same direction.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.624
This way.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.713
Time for bed.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.433
You're right here,
next to me.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.730
Uh, Mother,
can we have a story?

30:53.310 --> 30:54.527
What kind of story?

30:54.603 --> 30:55.604
A good one.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.734
A long one.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.065
With fighting.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.568
Okay.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.078
How about the tale
of the Grimm and the Wolf?

31:07.157 --> 31:09.205
That's the one
my mother always told me.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.877
What's a Grimm?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.122
A Grimm is a hunter.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.457
What does it hunt?

31:14.539 --> 31:16.792
A Grimm can see Wesen,

31:16.875 --> 31:20.175
but they don't always know which
are good or which are bad,

31:20.253 --> 31:21.971
so they hunt them all.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.094
What's a Wesen?

31:23.215 --> 31:26.094
Let her tell us the story.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.316
The story begins with a boy.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.984
But not just any boy.

31:34.059 --> 31:38.189
This boy changed into a wolf,
but only when he got angry.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.273
He couldn't help it.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.984
His parents warned him that

31:42.067 --> 31:44.570
he should never show anger
in front of strangers

31:44.653 --> 31:49.454
because you can never tell if that
stranger is a Grimm until it's too late.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.664
But the boy,
he was proud of what he was.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.090
So he was a boy and a wolf?

31:57.165 --> 31:59.088
He was Blutbaden.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.510
Have you heard of Blutbaden?

32:03.463 --> 32:04.931
Did he listen to his mother?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.053
No.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.848
And that's always a mistake.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.472
It's getting stronger.

32:20.272 --> 32:25.119
Once the boy realized he had
woged in front of a Grimm,

32:25.193 --> 32:27.537
he realized his mistake.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.832
The Grimm knew
he was a Blut...

32:31.116 --> 32:32.333
Button?

32:32.659 --> 32:34.206
Blutbad, yes.

32:35.036 --> 32:40.384
The boy saw the Grimm's eyes
turn as black as a night

32:40.459 --> 32:42.302
without a moon or star in it.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.547
But by then, it was too late.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.221
The Grimm had cut off
the Blutbad boy's head.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.429
I don't like this story
very much.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.148
Hmm.
Well, it's not finished yet.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.727
The parents of the boy wanted
to seek revenge on the Grimm.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.440
So they decided to
set a trap for him.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.367
It's really strong here.

33:06.902 --> 33:07.903
Monroe!

33:41.937 --> 33:43.610
This is it.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.361
That's the truck.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.908
Wait a minute.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.075
I got Rosalee.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.279
We're close.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.277
Mother?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.116
Mother!

34:32.779 --> 34:34.156
No.
Where is she?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.492
No, no. She left us.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.043
She left us!

34:57.387 --> 34:58.934
Why did you do that?

34:59.014 --> 35:01.187
Because she's a bad mother.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.185
Get her out.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.779
We warned you about
what happens to mothers

35:13.862 --> 35:15.785
who abandon their children.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.879
Oh, this has gone
far enough.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.475
Don't make me hurt you.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.685
Wait!

35:45.769 --> 35:47.316
She's like me!

35:48.229 --> 35:50.698
She's the same as me.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.026
You're the same as me!

35:55.236 --> 35:56.783
My real mother.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.081
You all need to listen to me.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.162
Someone's coming.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.497
Monroe!
Who is it?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.457
- My husband. He's looking for me.
- No, no, no. You...

36:07.540 --> 36:08.917
You can't let them take her.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.252
We won't.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.636
Rosalee!

36:12.712 --> 36:15.591
She's ours! You can't have her!

36:21.304 --> 36:22.772
He's a Grimm!

36:24.724 --> 36:26.476
He's gonna cut off my head!

36:26.935 --> 36:27.982
You little...

36:29.270 --> 36:30.738
Ro! Stop.

36:30.814 --> 36:31.940
Don't hurt him.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.692
Oh, my God.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.071
They're just kids.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.872
No, no, no,
you can't leave.

36:39.948 --> 36:40.948
Not again.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.333
What the hell?

36:42.409 --> 36:44.377
They didn't hurt me.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.626
I don't want to go back.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.515
Just need you
to sign the statement.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.140
Now what?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.896
Child Services take over.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.319
A judge will decide
where they end up.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.522
So they go back
into the system.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.022
They do.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.239
Where they learn to be
even more angry at the world.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.179
I'm sorry I couldn't be
your mother.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.311
This world doesn't
seem fair sometimes.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.015
It can be pretty painful.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.727
I wish I could make it
better for you.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.068
Lily?

38:01.863 --> 38:04.082
Maybe I could write to you,

38:04.157 --> 38:06.205
maybe send you
some goldenseal for...

38:06.284 --> 38:08.787
I never want to see you again.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.292
I hate you.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.906
Sorry.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.826
New place, couldn't sleep.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.661
Isn't it the baby that's supposed
to keep the parents awake?

38:51.246 --> 38:53.499
Kelly's got a lot less
to worry about.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.299
For now at least.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.844
Nick, I don't want to be
alone right now.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.181
I know this is...

39:05.260 --> 39:07.228
Well, whatever it is,

39:07.303 --> 39:10.933
but maybe just for tonight,
you could sleep in our room?

39:14.644 --> 39:15.987
I'm sorry.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.314
This is too weird.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.276
I think we're beyond
weird at this point.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.009
Thank you.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.814
You can only do so much.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.142
I know.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.237
But when I was staying
with them, it just...

39:57.312 --> 39:58.814
Staying?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.320
God, you make it
sound like a Holiday Inn.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.579
I told them a story
my mother used to tell me.

40:06.654 --> 40:10.124
It was a Wesen story, so of course
the Grimm killed him in the end.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.246
Of course.

40:11.326 --> 40:15.331
It hit me that these kids
have no idea what they are.

40:16.873 --> 40:17.874
Really?

40:17.957 --> 40:19.504
They don't know
they're Wesen?

40:19.584 --> 40:20.631
No.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.924
I mean,
they know they're different,

40:23.004 --> 40:26.099
and that I'm different
and you're different,

40:26.174 --> 40:29.178
but they have no idea
what our reality means.

40:30.094 --> 40:34.019
Look, whatever kind of family
you have, reality is relative.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.099
You know?

40:35.183 --> 40:37.857
Normal is just
the middle of the mess.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.865
I just hope
they find the help they need.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.540
I'm Warden Hooke.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.961
I want you to know
your friend Lily is well.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.917
She's not our friend.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.094
She's our sister.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.297
You guys think
you're tough?

41:05.380 --> 41:07.098
I know what you are.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.050
So show me.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.935
I said, "Show me."

41:23.690 --> 41:24.816
Good.

41:28.528 --> 41:33.910
Boys, I'm offering you a chance
to join others like yourselves,

41:33.992 --> 41:35.710
to stop hiding what you are.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.537
Repeat after me.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.874
Occultatum Libera.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.589
Occultatum Libera.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.588
What's it mean?

41:47.588 --> 41:50.262
It means
you have a new family.

41:58.558 --> 41:59.605
Let's go.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.444
It's time.
