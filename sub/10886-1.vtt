03:19.700 --> 03:22.000
It is my sad duty to inform you

03:22.200 --> 03:27.400
that Eva Perón, spiritual leader
of the nation, entered immortality

03:27.700 --> 03:29.300
at 8:25

03:29.600 --> 03:31.500
this evening.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.100
- You are not welcome here.
- He was the father of my children too.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.300
They have a right to see him,
to pay their last respects.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.700
You are not his wife.
Your children are bastards.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.000
No, no! He's my papa!

08:48.000 --> 08:49.700
Oh what a circus

08:49.900 --> 08:52.300
Oh what a show

08:52.500 --> 08:55.500
Argentina has gone to town

08:55.800 --> 08:57.700
Over the death of an actress

08:57.800 --> 08:59.600
Called Eva Perón

09:00.700 --> 09:03.600
We've all gone crazy

09:03.900 --> 09:06.900
Mourning all day and mourning all night

09:07.200 --> 09:11.100
Falling over ourselves to get all

09:11.400 --> 09:14.700
Of the misery right

09:15.700 --> 09:17.400
Oh what an exit

09:17.500 --> 09:19.800
That's how to go

09:20.000 --> 09:23.400
When they're ringing your curtain down

09:23.700 --> 09:25.500
Demand to be buried

09:25.700 --> 09:28.300
Like Eva Perón

09:28.500 --> 09:31.300
It's quite a sunset

09:31.500 --> 09:34.600
And good for the country
ln a roundabout way

09:34.800 --> 09:38.500
We've made the front page of all

09:38.800 --> 09:41.300
The world's papers today

09:42.400 --> 09:45.000
But who is this Santa Evita?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.800
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.400
What kind of goddess has lived among us?

09:52.700 --> 09:56.500
How will we ever get by without her?

09:59.400 --> 10:03.900
She had her moments
She had some style

10:04.200 --> 10:07.100
The best show in town was the crowd

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
Outside the Casa Rosada

10:09.500 --> 10:12.200
Crying, "Eva Perón"

10:12.700 --> 10:15.200
But that's all gone now

10:15.400 --> 10:18.900
As soon as the smoke
from the funeral clears

10:19.100 --> 10:22.800
We're all gonna see, and how

10:23.100 --> 10:26.200
She did nothing for years

10:53.900 --> 10:56.900
You let down your people, Evita

10:57.200 --> 11:00.600
You were supposed to have been immortal

11:00.800 --> 11:02.300
That's all they wanted

11:02.500 --> 11:04.300
Not much to ask for

11:04.500 --> 11:06.100
But in the end you

11:06.200 --> 11:09.100
Could not deliver

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Sing, you fools, but you got it wrong

11:13.200 --> 11:15.300
Enjoy your prayers
because you haven't got long

11:15.500 --> 11:17.500
Your queen is dead
Your king is through

11:17.700 --> 11:20.900
She's not coming back to you

11:21.200 --> 11:23.000
Show business kept us all alive

11:23.200 --> 11:25.700
Since 1 7 October 1 945

11:25.900 --> 11:28.600
But the star has gone
The glamour's worn thin

11:28.900 --> 11:31.300
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

11:31.500 --> 11:34.000
Instead of government, we had a stage

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage

11:36.400 --> 11:38.500
Instead of help, we were given a crowd

11:38.700 --> 11:41.800
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

13:34.100 --> 13:38.000
Don't cry for me, Argentina

13:38.300 --> 13:41.000
For I am ordinary

13:41.300 --> 13:43.400
Unimportant

13:43.600 --> 13:45.900
And undeserving

13:46.100 --> 13:48.600
Of such attention

13:48.800 --> 13:51.400
Unless we all are

13:51.600 --> 13:54.000
I think we all are

13:54.200 --> 13:57.800
So share my glory

13:58.100 --> 14:01.100
So share my coffin

14:14.100 --> 14:17.600
It's our funeral too

15:10.500 --> 15:12.000
Senor Magaldi?

15:12.200 --> 15:14.700
It's seven o' clock. You'll be late.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.900
Now, Eva Perón

15:26.100 --> 15:27.800
Had every disadvantage

15:27.900 --> 15:30.500
You need if you're going to succeed

15:30.700 --> 15:32.300
No money, no cash

15:32.500 --> 15:34.200
No father, no bright lights

15:34.500 --> 15:36.100
There was nowhere she'd been

15:36.300 --> 15:38.800
At the age of 1 5

15:39.300 --> 15:43.000
As this tango singer found out

15:45.200 --> 15:47.700
Agustin Magaldi

15:47.900 --> 15:51.000
Who has the distinction of being the first

15:51.400 --> 15:53.300
Man to be of use

15:53.500 --> 15:57.000
To Eva Duarte

16:07.400 --> 16:12.500
On this night of 1 000 stars

16:12.900 --> 16:16.900
Let me take you to heaven's door

16:17.100 --> 16:20.800
Where the music of love's guitars

16:21.200 --> 16:24.300
Plays forever more

16:25.700 --> 16:29.400
In the glow of those twinkling lights

16:29.600 --> 16:33.000
We shall love through eternity

16:34.200 --> 16:37.400
On this night in a million nights

16:38.400 --> 16:42.200
Fly away with me

16:43.600 --> 16:47.900
I never dreamed that a kiss
could be as sweet as this

16:48.300 --> 16:51.300
Now I know that it can

16:52.200 --> 16:56.200
I used to wander alone
without a love of my own

16:56.500 --> 17:00.000
I was a desperate man

17:00.800 --> 17:03.000
But all my grief disappeared

17:03.200 --> 17:09.200
And all the sorrow I'd feared
wasn't there any more

17:10.200 --> 17:16.000
On that magical day
When you first came my way, miamor

18:14.200 --> 18:17.300
To think that a man
as famous as you are

18:17.500 --> 18:20.200
Could love a poor little nothing like me

18:21.000 --> 18:26.300
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

18:33.900 --> 18:35.400
Just listen to that

18:35.500 --> 18:36.800
They're onto you, Magaldi

18:37.100 --> 18:38.800
I'd get out while you can

18:39.500 --> 18:40.900
It's happened at last

18:41.100 --> 18:42.900
I'm starting to get started

18:43.100 --> 18:44.600
I'm moving out with my man

18:44.800 --> 18:47.300
Now, Eva, don't get carried away

18:47.500 --> 18:51.100
Monotony passed, suburbia departed

18:51.400 --> 18:54.300
Who could ever be fond
of the back of beyond

18:54.600 --> 18:56.800
Don't hear words that I didn't say

18:57.000 --> 18:58.400
What's that?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.200
You desert the girl you love?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.700
The girl I love?

19:02.900 --> 19:04.700
What are you talking about?

19:04.900 --> 19:09.600
She really brightened up
your out of town engagement

19:11.500 --> 19:16.200
She gave you all she had
She wasn't in your contract

19:17.800 --> 19:20.200
You must be quite relieved

19:20.400 --> 19:22.900
That no one's told the papers

19:23.200 --> 19:25.300
So far

19:25.500 --> 19:32.000
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

19:33.700 --> 19:35.500
Would I have done

19:35.700 --> 19:37.400
What I did

19:37.900 --> 19:40.400
If I hadn't thought

19:40.900 --> 19:42.700
If I hadn't known

19:43.800 --> 19:46.600
We would stay together?

20:07.600 --> 20:10.600
Seems to me there's no point in resisting

20:11.100 --> 20:13.800
She's made up her mind,
you've no choice

20:14.300 --> 20:16.900
Why don't you be the man
who discovered her?

20:17.100 --> 20:19.900
You'll never be remembered for your voice

20:20.800 --> 20:23.400
The city can be paradise

20:23.600 --> 20:26.300
For those who have the cash

20:27.100 --> 20:29.800
The class and the connections

20:30.100 --> 20:33.200
What you need to make a splash

20:33.400 --> 20:36.100
The likes of you get swept up

20:36.300 --> 20:39.500
In the morning with the trash

20:39.900 --> 20:42.300
If you were rich or middle class...

20:42.600 --> 20:45.000
Screw the middle classes

20:45.200 --> 20:47.100
I will never accept them

20:48.000 --> 20:51.700
My father's other family were middle class

20:52.300 --> 20:54.400
And we were kept out of sight

20:54.600 --> 20:57.500
Hidden from view at his funeral

20:57.700 --> 21:00.400
Do all your one night stands

21:00.600 --> 21:02.300
Give you this trouble?

21:05.800 --> 21:09.200
Eva, beware of the city

21:09.700 --> 21:11.700
It's hungry and cold

21:12.000 --> 21:13.600
Can't be controlled

21:13.700 --> 21:15.500
It is mad

21:15.700 --> 21:19.700
Those who are fools
are swallowed up whole

21:20.100 --> 21:22.000
And those who are not become

21:22.200 --> 21:24.200
What they should not become

21:24.400 --> 21:26.300
Changed, in short they go bad

21:26.400 --> 21:28.200
Bad is good for me

21:28.400 --> 21:30.200
I'm bored, so clean and so ignored

21:30.400 --> 21:33.000
I've only been predictable, respectable

21:33.200 --> 21:37.300
Birds fly out of here
So why, oh why, oh why the hell can't l?

21:37.600 --> 21:41.400
I only want variety of society

21:41.700 --> 21:45.900
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

21:51.400 --> 21:55.200
Five years from now I shall come back

21:55.400 --> 21:58.600
And finally say
You have your way

21:58.900 --> 22:01.200
Come to town

22:01.400 --> 22:05.200
But you'll look at me
with a foreigner's eyes

22:05.400 --> 22:07.100
The magical city

22:07.300 --> 22:09.100
A younger girl's city

22:09.300 --> 22:12.000
A fantasy long since put down

22:12.200 --> 22:15.200
All you've done to me
Was that a young girl's fantasy?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.400
I played your city games all right, didn't l?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.600
I already know what cooks

22:20.700 --> 22:22.300
How the dirty city feels and looks

22:22.500 --> 22:25.300
I tasted it last night, didn't l?

22:36.400 --> 22:39.600
Eva, beware your ambition

22:40.100 --> 22:41.700
It's hungry and cold

22:41.900 --> 22:45.900
Can't be controlled, will run wild

22:46.200 --> 22:49.500
This in a man is danger enough

22:49.700 --> 22:51.600
But you are a woman

22:51.800 --> 22:53.500
Not even a woman

22:53.700 --> 22:56.300
Not very much more than a child

22:56.500 --> 23:00.600
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away

23:41.300 --> 23:44.600
What's new, Buenos Aires?

23:45.200 --> 23:48.200
I'm new
I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you

23:48.500 --> 23:50.900
You'll be on me too

23:51.600 --> 23:55.200
I get out here, Buenos Aires

23:55.800 --> 23:57.100
Stand back

23:57.300 --> 23:59.100
You oughta know
What you're gonna get in me

23:59.200 --> 24:02.700
Just a little touch of star quality

24:07.600 --> 24:11.100
Fill me up with your heat
With your noise, with your dirt, overdo me

24:11.300 --> 24:15.400
Let me dance to your beat
Make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me

24:15.800 --> 24:19.100
Don't hold back
You are certain to impress

24:19.300 --> 24:22.700
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying

24:27.100 --> 24:30.300
Get this! Just look at me
Dressed up somewhere to go

24:30.500 --> 24:33.500
We'll put on a show

24:37.600 --> 24:41.300
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming

24:41.500 --> 24:43.400
Shoot me up with your blood
Wine me up with your nights

24:43.600 --> 24:45.700
Watch me coming

24:46.000 --> 24:49.300
All I want is a whole lot of excess

24:49.600 --> 24:52.400
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing

24:53.800 --> 24:57.100
Stand back, Buenos Aires

24:57.400 --> 25:00.500
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me

25:00.800 --> 25:03.200
Just a little touch of star quality

25:05.200 --> 25:07.600
And

25:08.500 --> 25:11.400
If ever I go to far

25:11.700 --> 25:15.700
It's because of the things you are

25:16.000 --> 25:18.500
Beautiful town

25:18.800 --> 25:20.700
I love you

25:20.800 --> 25:23.800
And

25:24.100 --> 25:27.100
If I need a moment's rest

25:27.300 --> 25:30.900
Give your lover the very best

25:31.600 --> 25:34.700
Real eiderdown

25:35.000 --> 25:36.800
And silence

26:42.700 --> 26:44.800
You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death

26:45.000 --> 26:46.200
You are shoddy

26:46.500 --> 26:50.500
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body

26:50.900 --> 26:54.300
Put me down for a lifetime of success

26:54.500 --> 26:57.000
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

26:59.000 --> 27:01.700
Rio de la Plata

27:01.900 --> 27:05.000
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio

27:05.800 --> 27:08.300
All I want to know

28:15.900 --> 28:19.400
I don't expect my love affairs

28:19.700 --> 28:23.300
To last for long

28:23.500 --> 28:26.700
Never fool myself

28:27.000 --> 28:30.700
That my dreams will come true

28:31.200 --> 28:33.900
Being used to trouble

28:34.200 --> 28:38.200
I anticipate it

28:38.800 --> 28:42.500
But all the same I hate it

28:42.700 --> 28:44.900
Wouldn't you?

28:45.100 --> 28:46.900
So what happens now?

28:47.100 --> 28:50.600
Another suitcase in another hall

28:50.800 --> 28:53.100
Take your picture off another wall

28:53.300 --> 28:57.600
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by, you always have before

29:15.100 --> 29:17.300
Time and time again

29:17.600 --> 29:19.100
I've said that

29:19.300 --> 29:22.100
I don't care

29:22.300 --> 29:25.200
That I'm immune to gloom

29:26.300 --> 29:29.800
That I'm hard through and through

29:30.000 --> 29:32.800
But every time it matters

29:33.000 --> 29:37.300
All my words desert me

29:37.600 --> 29:41.700
So anyone can hurt me

29:42.000 --> 29:43.900
And they do

29:44.100 --> 29:46.600
So what happens now?

29:46.800 --> 29:50.100
Another suitcase in another hall

29:50.300 --> 29:53.700
Take your picture off another wall

29:54.000 --> 29:55.900
You'll get by you always have before

29:56.200 --> 30:00.200
Where am I going to?

30:52.700 --> 30:55.300
Call in three months time

30:55.500 --> 30:58.000
And I'll be fine

30:58.200 --> 30:59.900
I know

31:00.100 --> 31:03.200
Well, maybe not that fine

31:03.500 --> 31:07.100
But I'll survive anyhow

31:07.700 --> 31:11.500
I won't recall the names and places

31:11.700 --> 31:15.000
Of each sad occasion

31:15.300 --> 31:19.000
But that's no consolation

31:19.200 --> 31:21.500
Here and now

31:33.700 --> 31:36.500
Where am I going to?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.300
Don't ask any more

33:13.800 --> 33:16.400
Good night and thank you, whoever

33:16.600 --> 33:19.800
She's in every magazine
Been photographed, seen

33:20.000 --> 33:21.700
She is known

33:21.900 --> 33:24.900
We don't like to rush
but your case has been packed

33:25.100 --> 33:28.000
If she's missed anything
you could give her a ring

33:28.300 --> 33:31.600
But she won't always answer the phone

33:31.800 --> 33:34.600
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

33:34.800 --> 33:37.100
But we have pretended enough

33:38.200 --> 33:41.300
It's best that we both
stop fooling ourselves

33:41.500 --> 33:43.700
Which means...!

33:44.900 --> 33:47.600
There is no one, no one at all

33:47.900 --> 33:53.000
Never has been and never will be a lover,
male or female

33:53.300 --> 33:55.100
Who hasn't an eye on

33:55.300 --> 33:59.600
In fact they rely on tricks
they can try on their partner

33:59.900 --> 34:03.300
They're hoping their lover
will help them or keep them

34:03.500 --> 34:04.900
Support them, promote them

34:05.100 --> 34:08.500
Don't blame them
You're the same

34:21.800 --> 34:24.500
Good night and thank you, Emilio

34:24.800 --> 34:27.100
You've completed your task

34:27.300 --> 34:29.800
What more can we ask of you now?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.900
Please sign the book
on the way out the door

34:33.100 --> 34:36.100
And that will be all
lf she needs you, she'll call

34:36.300 --> 34:39.300
But I don't think that's likely somehow

34:39.600 --> 34:43.100
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

34:43.300 --> 34:45.400
But when we were hot
we were hot

34:46.000 --> 34:49.300
I know you'll look back
on the good times we shared

34:49.600 --> 34:51.800
Which means...!

34:52.900 --> 34:55.199
There is no one, no one at all

34:55.500 --> 34:59.100
Never has been
and never will be a lover

34:59.400 --> 35:01.200
Male or female

35:01.300 --> 35:05.100
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on

35:05.500 --> 35:07.800
Tricks they can try on their partner

35:08.000 --> 35:11.100
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them

35:11.300 --> 35:12.700
Support them, promote them

35:12.900 --> 35:16.400
Don't blame her
You're the same

35:16.700 --> 35:19.200
There is no soap
No soap like Zaz

35:19.400 --> 35:23.300
No detergent, lotion or oil
With such power

35:23.500 --> 35:24.800
In the shower

35:24.900 --> 35:26.600
It's the mother and father

35:26.800 --> 35:28.600
Of luxury lather

35:28.900 --> 35:31.700
The talk of the bath
The great ointment

35:32.000 --> 35:34.500
One little frolic
With new Zaz carbolic

35:34.700 --> 35:36.800
You're scented

35:37.000 --> 35:38.500
You'll be sent

35:44.800 --> 35:47.500
Good night and thank you, Senor Jabón

35:47.700 --> 35:49.400
We are grateful

35:49.600 --> 35:52.600
You found her a spot on the sound radio

35:53.100 --> 35:56.100
We'll think of you
every time she's on the air

35:56.400 --> 35:59.300
We'd love you to stay
but you'd be in the way

35:59.500 --> 36:01.600
So do up your trousers and go

36:09.500 --> 36:12.300
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies

36:12.500 --> 36:15.400
The decline into silence and doubt

36:15.600 --> 36:18.800
Our passion was just too intense to survive

36:19.100 --> 36:21.100
Which means...!

36:22.500 --> 36:25.000
This is a club I should never have joined

36:25.300 --> 36:28.100
Someone has made us look fools

36:29.200 --> 36:31.500
Argentine men call the sexual shots

36:31.800 --> 36:34.400
Someone has altered the rules

36:35.600 --> 36:38.300
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes

36:38.500 --> 36:41.600
Is all very well, but every girl knows

36:42.000 --> 36:44.800
She needs a man she can monopolise

36:45.000 --> 36:48.200
With fingers in dozens of different pies

37:28.700 --> 37:30.200
In June of '43

37:30.400 --> 37:32.300
There was a military coup

37:32.500 --> 37:34.200
Behind it was a gang called

37:34.300 --> 37:35.700
The G.O.U.

37:35.900 --> 37:36.900
Who did not feel

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
The need to be elected

37:42.800 --> 37:46.000
They had themselves a party
at the point of a gun

37:46.200 --> 37:49.500
They were slightly to the right
of Attila the Hun

37:49.800 --> 37:55.600
A bomb or two
And very few objected

37:57.100 --> 37:58.300
Just one shell

37:58.500 --> 38:01.300
And governments fall like flies

38:02.300 --> 38:05.700
Ka-pow, die
They stumble and fall

38:05.900 --> 38:08.900
Bye-bye
Backs to the wall

38:09.100 --> 38:12.300
Aim high
We're having a ball

38:12.600 --> 38:18.000
The tank and bullet ruled
As democracy died

38:28.300 --> 38:31.600
The lady's got potential
She was setting her sights

38:31.900 --> 38:35.200
On making it in movies
with her name in lights

38:35.400 --> 38:40.300
The greatest social climber
since Cinderella

38:43.000 --> 38:46.300
OK, she couldn't act
But she had the right friends

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
And we all know
a career depends

38:49.500 --> 38:51.800
On knowing the right fella

38:52.000 --> 38:54.900
To be stellar

38:57.000 --> 39:01.100
Just one shell
And governments lose their nerve

39:12.000 --> 39:18.100
That's how we get
The government we deserve

39:28.000 --> 39:31.300
Now, the man behind the president
calling the shots

39:31.600 --> 39:34.200
Involved so discreetly
in a lot of their plots

39:35.000 --> 39:37.500
Was Colonel Juan Perón

39:37.700 --> 39:40.800
Would-be dictator

39:41.900 --> 39:45.200
He began in the army out in ltaly so

39:47.800 --> 39:49.000
Saw Mussolini's rise
from the very front row

39:49.200 --> 39:51.600
And reckoned he'd do likewise

39:51.900 --> 39:54.900
Sooner or later

39:56.200 --> 40:00.300
Just one blast
And the tear gas falls like rain

40:03.100 --> 40:04.900
They haven't a chance

40:06.300 --> 40:08.500
The terrorists advance

40:08.700 --> 40:11.700
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands

40:11.900 --> 40:14.500
Perón was biding time out

40:14.700 --> 40:18.200
In the slow lane

40:22.500 --> 40:24.700
Suddenly an earthquake hit

40:24.900 --> 40:27.400
The town of San Juan

40:29.300 --> 40:31.200
They stumble and fall

40:33.200 --> 40:34.600
Keep away from the wall

40:34.800 --> 40:36.200
But one guy

40:36.500 --> 40:38.000
Was having a ball

40:38.200 --> 40:43.800
The tragedy a golden chance for Perón

40:50.700 --> 40:53.600
He organised a concert
With incredible flair

40:53.800 --> 40:56.600
In aid of all the victims
Such a grand affair

40:57.500 --> 41:02.700
Politicians, actors
Stars of every flavour

41:04.400 --> 41:07.800
It was January 22, 1 944

41:08.100 --> 41:11.300
A night to remember, that's for sure

41:11.500 --> 41:16.500
For that's the night
That Perón first met Eva

41:29.600 --> 41:33.700
On this night

41:35.300 --> 41:38.900
On this night

41:41.100 --> 41:45.600
On this night of 1 000 stars

41:45.900 --> 41:50.200
Let me take you to heaven's door

41:50.500 --> 41:54.900
Where the music of love's guitars

41:56.100 --> 42:01.300
Plays for evermore

42:40.400 --> 42:43.300
Your act hasn't changed much

42:45.100 --> 42:47.300
Neither has yours

43:09.600 --> 43:15.000
I stand here
as a servant of the people

43:16.100 --> 43:20.200
As we come together
for a marvellous cause

43:20.400 --> 43:22.500
You've shown by your presence

43:22.700 --> 43:25.300
Your deeds and applause

43:25.600 --> 43:27.800
What the people can do

43:28.100 --> 43:32.200
True power is yours
Not the government's

43:32.400 --> 43:36.300
Unless it represents

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
The people

43:58.200 --> 44:00.600
One always picks

44:00.800 --> 44:03.500
The easy fight

44:03.700 --> 44:06.200
One praises fools

44:06.400 --> 44:09.400
One smothers light

44:10.600 --> 44:12.800
One shifts

44:13.000 --> 44:15.600
From left to right

44:16.200 --> 44:17.700
Politics

44:17.900 --> 44:21.300
The art of the possible

44:59.400 --> 45:04.000
I've heard so much about you

45:04.800 --> 45:07.100
I'm amazed

45:07.300 --> 45:10.200
- For I'm only an actress
- For I'm only a soldier

45:10.400 --> 45:12.300
- Nothing to shout about
- One of the thousands

45:12.500 --> 45:16.200
- Only a girl on the air
- Defending the country he loves

45:20.800 --> 45:22.300
But when you act

45:22.500 --> 45:25.600
The things you do affect us all

45:27.900 --> 45:30.300
But when you act

45:30.500 --> 45:34.900
You take us away
from the squalor of the real world

45:36.200 --> 45:40.100
- Are you here on your own?
- Yes. Oh yes

45:42.600 --> 45:44.400
So am I

45:44.600 --> 45:47.300
What a fortunate coincidence

45:47.500 --> 45:49.700
Maybe you're my reward

45:50.000 --> 45:52.800
For my efforts here tonight

45:54.300 --> 45:56.500
It seems crazy

45:56.700 --> 45:59.600
But you must believe

45:59.800 --> 46:02.100
There's nothing calculated

46:02.300 --> 46:04.700
Nothing planned

46:04.900 --> 46:06.400
Please forgive me

46:06.600 --> 46:09.400
If I seem naive

46:09.600 --> 46:13.400
I would never want to force your hand

46:13.700 --> 46:18.700
But please understand I'd be good for you

46:19.300 --> 46:24.300
I don't always rush in like this

46:24.600 --> 46:29.200
20 seconds after saying hello

46:29.500 --> 46:33.900
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss

46:34.200 --> 46:37.800
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so

46:38.100 --> 46:41.900
But you really should know
I'd be good for you

46:43.200 --> 46:47.600
I'd be surprisingly good for you

46:57.300 --> 47:01.300
I won't go on if I'm boring you

47:01.600 --> 47:05.500
But do you understand my point of view

47:05.800 --> 47:07.900
Do you like what you hear
What you see

47:08.200 --> 47:11.200
And would you be

47:12.000 --> 47:14.400
Good for me too?

47:18.800 --> 47:23.200
I'm not talking of a hurried night

47:23.500 --> 47:28.300
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye

47:28.600 --> 47:32.800
Creeping home before it gets too light

47:33.200 --> 47:37.100
That's not the reason
that I caught your eye

47:37.300 --> 47:42.500
Which has to imply I'd be good for you

48:15.500 --> 48:19.400
Please go on. You enthral me

48:19.700 --> 48:22.900
I can understand you perfectly

48:23.200 --> 48:26.000
And I like what I hear, what I see

48:26.200 --> 48:28.800
And knowing me

48:30.100 --> 48:35.100
I would be good for you too

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I'm not talking

48:41.200 --> 48:43.700
Of a hurried night

48:43.900 --> 48:45.600
A frantic tumble

48:45.800 --> 48:48.500
Then a shy goodbye

48:49.000 --> 48:52.200
Creeping home before it gets too light

48:53.600 --> 48:57.400
That's not the reason
That I caught your eye

48:57.700 --> 49:02.400
Which has to imply I'd be good for you

49:40.400 --> 49:43.300
There is no one, no one at all

49:43.600 --> 49:46.800
Never has been, and never will be a lover

49:47.000 --> 49:48.800
Male or female

49:49.000 --> 49:52.100
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on

49:52.300 --> 49:54.300
Tricks they can try on their partner

49:55.600 --> 49:58.600
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them

49:58.900 --> 50:02.900
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

50:15.700 --> 50:17.100
Hello and goodbye

50:17.200 --> 50:19.900
I've just unemployed you

50:20.100 --> 50:21.700
You can go back to school

50:21.900 --> 50:23.500
You've had a good run

50:23.700 --> 50:25.900
I'm sure he enjoyed you

50:26.100 --> 50:29.400
Don't act sad or surprised
Let's be friends, civilised

50:32.600 --> 50:36.800
Come on, little one
Don't sit there like a dummy

50:37.100 --> 50:40.300
The day you knew would arrive is here

50:40.600 --> 50:42.000
You'll survive

50:42.100 --> 50:44.700
So move, funny face

50:46.600 --> 50:49.600
I like your conversation

50:49.900 --> 50:53.500
You've a catchy turn of phrase

50:53.900 --> 50:59.400
You're obviously going through
Some adolescent phase

51:23.900 --> 51:27.200
So what happens now?

51:32.900 --> 51:34.500
Where am I going to?

51:34.800 --> 51:37.200
You'll get by, you always have before

51:41.200 --> 51:44.200
Don't ask any more

52:26.550 --> 52:29.250
At the watering-holes

52:30.150 --> 52:32.550
Of the well-to-do

52:32.750 --> 52:35.550
I detect a resistance to

52:35.750 --> 52:36.750
Precisely

52:36.950 --> 52:38.850
Our heroine's style

52:39.050 --> 52:41.150
We're glad you noticed

52:41.350 --> 52:44.150
The shooting sticks

52:44.350 --> 52:46.150
Of the upper class

52:46.350 --> 52:47.450
Give her an inch...

52:47.650 --> 52:50.550
Aren't supporting a single ass

52:50.950 --> 52:53.050
That would rise for the girl

52:53.250 --> 52:54.850
...She'll take a mile

52:55.150 --> 52:58.550
Such a shame she wandered

52:58.850 --> 53:01.450
Into our enclosure

53:01.650 --> 53:05.550
How unfortunate this person

53:05.850 --> 53:08.350
Has forced us to be blunt

53:09.450 --> 53:13.750
No, we wouldn't mind

53:13.950 --> 53:16.250
Seeing her at Harrods

53:16.450 --> 53:20.250
But behind the jewellery counter

53:20.550 --> 53:21.950
Not in front

53:25.150 --> 53:27.750
Could there be

53:28.250 --> 53:31.250
In our fighting corps

53:31.550 --> 53:34.850
A lack of enthusiasm for

53:35.050 --> 53:37.050
Perón's latest flame?

53:37.250 --> 53:39.450
You said it, brother

53:39.650 --> 53:42.250
Should you wish

53:42.750 --> 53:45.450
To cause great distress

53:45.650 --> 53:49.250
In the tidiest officer's mess

53:49.550 --> 53:51.650
Just mention her name

53:51.850 --> 53:53.550
That isn't funny

53:54.150 --> 53:57.250
Perón is a fool, breaking every taboo

53:57.450 --> 54:00.750
Installing the girl in the army H.Q.

54:00.950 --> 54:04.450
And she's an actress, the last straw

54:04.950 --> 54:08.250
Her only good parts
Are between her thighs

54:08.550 --> 54:11.750
She should stare at the ceiling
Not reach for the skies

54:11.950 --> 54:15.750
Or she could be his last whore

54:16.050 --> 54:18.450
The evidence suggests

54:19.250 --> 54:21.850
She has other interests

54:22.850 --> 54:25.450
If it's her that's using him

54:26.450 --> 54:29.050
He's exceptionally dim

54:34.950 --> 54:37.450
Dangerous Jade

54:37.650 --> 54:40.850
We have allowed ourselves to slip

54:41.150 --> 54:43.450
We have completely lost our grip

54:44.350 --> 54:47.650
We have declined to an all-time low

54:47.850 --> 54:50.550
Tarts have become the set to know

54:51.450 --> 54:56.150
I'm only a radio star
with just one weekly show

54:56.450 --> 54:59.150
But speaking as one of the people

54:59.350 --> 55:01.750
I want you to know

55:01.950 --> 55:03.850
We are tired of

55:04.050 --> 55:06.550
The decline of Argentina

55:06.850 --> 55:09.250
With no sign of

55:09.450 --> 55:13.550
A government
able to give us the things we deserve

55:14.350 --> 55:17.550
It's no crime for officers
to do as they please

55:18.450 --> 55:21.150
As long as they're discreet
and keep clear of disease

55:21.450 --> 55:25.050
We ignore, we disregard

55:25.450 --> 55:28.550
But once they allow a bit on the side

55:28.750 --> 55:32.050
To move to the centre
where she's not qualified

55:32.250 --> 55:35.850
We are forced to mark his card

55:36.150 --> 55:38.750
She should get into her head

55:39.650 --> 55:42.050
She should not get out of bed

55:43.450 --> 55:46.350
She should know that she's not paid

55:47.350 --> 55:50.050
To be loud, but to be laid

55:50.250 --> 55:52.250
Slut

55:56.050 --> 55:58.450
Dangerous Jade

56:00.450 --> 56:03.250
This has really been your year
Miss Duarte

56:03.450 --> 56:06.450
Tell us where you go from here
Miss Duarte

56:06.650 --> 56:09.450
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?

56:09.850 --> 56:12.550
Whom did you sleep...dine with
yesterday?

56:13.050 --> 56:15.850
Acting is limiting
The lines not mine

56:16.050 --> 56:19.150
That's no help to the Argentine

56:19.450 --> 56:22.250
Can we assume then that you'll quit?

56:22.450 --> 56:25.450
Is this because of your involvement

56:25.650 --> 56:28.450
With Colonel Perón?

56:29.750 --> 56:33.150
She won't be kept happy
by her nights on the tiles

56:33.350 --> 56:34.950
She says it's his body

56:35.150 --> 56:36.650
But she's after his files

56:36.950 --> 56:40.150
So get back onto the street

56:40.350 --> 56:43.150
She should get into her head

56:43.850 --> 56:47.050
She should not get out of bed

56:48.050 --> 56:50.550
She should know that she's not paid

56:50.850 --> 56:53.550
To be loud, but to be laid

56:55.450 --> 56:57.550
The evidence suggests

56:58.350 --> 57:00.950
She has other interests

57:02.250 --> 57:05.550
If it's her that's using him

57:05.750 --> 57:08.350
He's exceptionally dim

57:09.050 --> 57:11.850
Things have reached a pretty pass

57:12.150 --> 57:15.950
When someone pretty lower class

57:16.350 --> 57:19.650
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired

57:19.850 --> 57:24.550
Can be accepted and admired

57:41.950 --> 57:46.050
Dice are rolling
The knives are out

57:46.350 --> 57:49.150
Would-be presidents are all around

57:49.350 --> 57:54.850
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm

57:55.150 --> 57:58.050
To see us six feet underground

58:02.050 --> 58:03.950
It doesn't matter

58:04.250 --> 58:07.050
What those morons say

58:07.250 --> 58:11.350
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew

58:11.650 --> 58:15.950
There's only 20 of them anyway

58:16.550 --> 58:19.950
What is 20 next to millions who

58:20.250 --> 58:22.850
Are looking to you?

58:25.750 --> 58:29.550
All you have to do is sit and wait

58:30.850 --> 58:34.950
Keeping out of everybody's way

58:35.150 --> 58:39.050
We'll... You'll be handed power

58:39.450 --> 58:42.150
On a plate

58:42.350 --> 58:45.650
When the ones who matter
Have their say

58:45.950 --> 58:48.150
And with chaos installed

58:50.950 --> 58:53.750
You can reluctantly agree

58:53.950 --> 58:56.650
To be called

58:57.150 --> 58:59.750
There again we could be foolish

59:00.150 --> 59:03.050
Not to quit while we're ahead

59:03.250 --> 59:05.550
For distance lends enchantment

59:05.750 --> 59:08.650
And that is why

59:08.850 --> 59:10.450
All exiles

59:10.650 --> 59:11.750
Are distinguished

59:11.850 --> 59:14.450
More important, they're not dead

59:14.650 --> 59:18.050
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

59:19.250 --> 59:22.150
This is crazy defeatist talk

59:22.450 --> 59:24.750
Why commit political suicide

59:24.950 --> 59:29.750
There's no risk
There's no call for any action at all

59:30.550 --> 59:34.850
When you have unions on your side

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:32.850
A new Argentina

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.650
The chains of the masses untied

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:45.250
The voice of the people

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:49.350
Cannot be denied

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:55.450
There is only one man
who can lead any workers' regime

01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:01.550
He lives for your problems
He shares your ideals and your dream

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.950
He supports you, for he loves you

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:10.350
Understands you, is one of you

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.750
If not

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:15.350
How could he love me?

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:19.650
A new Argentina

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.550
The workers' battle song

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.950
The voice of the people

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:37.950
Rings out loud and long

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:39.950
Now, I am a worker

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:43.350
I've suffered the way that you do

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:50.050
I've been unemployed
And I've starved, and I've hated it too

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:55.350
But I found my salvation in Perón

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:59.850
May the nation let him save them

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.350
As he saved me

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:10.150
A new age about to begin

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:18.850
We face the world together

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:24.050
And no dissent within

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:28.050
There again we could be foolish

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:31.150
Not to quit while we're ahead

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:35.450
I can see us many miles away, inactive

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.350
Sipping cocktails on a terrace

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:43.350
Taking breakfast in bed

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.650
Sleeping easy, doing nothing

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.650
It's attractive

01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:52.350
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.850
They always take some swallowing

01:02:55.750 --> 01:03:00.650
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep
Momentum, if it's you that you are following

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.450
Don't close doors
Keep an escape clause

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.950
Because we might lose

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.350
The Big Apple

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.550
But would I have done what I did

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.050
If I hadn't thought

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.750
If I hadn't known

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.050
We would take the country?

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.650
Perón has resigned from the army
and this we avow

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:50.650
The descamisados are those
he is marching with now

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.450
He supports you, for he loves you

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:59.050
Understands you, is one of you

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.050
If not

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:04.050
How could he love me?

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.850
Release him.
