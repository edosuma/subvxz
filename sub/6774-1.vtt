00:02.803 --> 00:06.572
<i>Liv:  This was my life
 before i died.</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:10.376
17-year-old male.
Went down playing basketball
20 minutes ago.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.943
-I've got no pulse.
-He's cyanotic.

00:11.946 --> 00:13.145
Where the hell is
our chief resident?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.747
Did someone page
dr. Jeffreys?

00:14.749 --> 00:16.749
I need x-ray, pulse ox
and a central line now.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.083
And the biggest needle
and syringe you've got.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.451
We're doing this now.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.823
We should wait
for dr. Jeffreys.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.963
(groans)

00:31.365 --> 00:32.631
Or not.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.135
Tell dr. Jeffreys
we're good here.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.172
Liv.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.607
It's so weird.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.075
You have all the makings
of a nemesis,

00:43.077 --> 00:45.811
But i actually
kind of like you.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.579
Want to go to a party tonight?

00:47.581 --> 00:50.082
Oh. I'm not really
a party person.

00:50.084 --> 00:54.153
Come on. Show everyone
you're not an over-achieving
pain in the ass.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.890
-It's on a boat.
-Thanks for the invite,
but i have plans.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.262
Next time, though.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.831
<i>So, basically every day
of your life is like the end
of  sixteen candles?</i>

01:07.468 --> 01:09.802
How psyched are people
when you're their doctor?

01:09.804 --> 01:11.737
Seriously,
if we weren't engaged

01:11.739 --> 01:14.907
I'd be here getting
emergency surgery
like every other day.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.642
Well, in three months
i'm all yours.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.711
Is there any way
we can push that up to,
like, now?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.213
Just go elope somewhere.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.015
'cause i'm kind of feeling
the need to lock this down.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.686
Oh, so, you're not gonna
believe this.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.555
That girl, marcy,
who i thought
wanted to kill me.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.323
She invited me to a party.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.059
Wow. So she's embracing
your overall perfection

01:34.061 --> 01:35.928
Rather than trying
to destroy you.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.329
Well played, marcy the rival.

01:37.331 --> 01:41.300
-It's on a boat or something.
-Tonight? You should go.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.769
Seriously, you're gonna
be stuck with me
for the rest of your life.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.338
Go. Tie one on.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.473
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:49.577 --> 01:50.943
(woman screaming)

01:54.215 --> 01:56.782
(people screaming)

01:56.784 --> 01:58.183
(grunting)

02:03.824 --> 02:05.357
<i>Liv:  The worst
 that can happen?</i>

02:05.359 --> 02:07.659
<i> Try an inexplicable
 zombie outbreak.</i>

02:12.366 --> 02:13.765
(coughs)

02:15.436 --> 02:17.970
<i> Followed by a sudden desire
 to eat brains.</i>

02:17.972 --> 02:19.204
(exhales)

02:26.413 --> 02:29.047
(emt shouting)

02:29.049 --> 02:31.016
<i>Liv:  I knew that party
 was gonna blow.</i>

02:39.593 --> 02:40.959
(beeps)

02:43.931 --> 02:47.866
<i> On the other hand,
 how often can you say
 you've been changed,</i>

02:47.868 --> 02:49.668
<i> Really changed, by a party?</i>

02:49.670 --> 02:51.770
(theme song playing)

03:17.565 --> 03:20.232
Hey, roomie. I know
you probably won't be
super into this...

03:20.234 --> 03:23.302
-Okay.
-But we thought we'd reinstate
potluck tuesday.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.437
-"we"?
-So we can all be together.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.106
On tuesdays.
Like old times, right?

03:28.108 --> 03:30.442
'cause we all just
like love you so much.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.880
And want to make sure
that you know that,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.348
Because, uh,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.617
Well, we're
a little concerned.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.286
Very concerned, honey.
About your recent behavior.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.122
Which we find to be
100% unlike you.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.658
That's me speaking on behalf
of your brother and me.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.660
No, it's not.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.629
What i'm about to say
comes from a place of love.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.964
You know that, don't you?

03:51.966 --> 03:54.266
That kind of depends
on what you say.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.367
You're throwing away
your life.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.902
Hmm.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.438
You traded a topnotch
residency at the hospital

03:59.440 --> 04:01.440
For a job at the morgue.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.676
And far be it for me
to weigh in on
my daughter's personal life,

04:04.678 --> 04:08.113
But you will regret
breaking off
your engagement

04:08.115 --> 04:11.016
To major till the end of time.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.752
Place of love.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.189
Do you have any idea
how many women would kill
to be with a man like this?

04:17.190 --> 04:19.491
Exactly four.
Yeah, i've met 'em.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.127
Quality women.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.630
Yeah. I don't know who
they plan on killing or why
they think that's my thing,

04:24.632 --> 04:28.533
But they're super-hot
and ready for murder.

04:28.535 --> 04:31.770
I was told that, um,
we wouldn't be bringing up
the engagement today.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.338
Just so you know.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.941
It's evidence.
It speaks to state of mind.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.809
I was also told we're not
putting you on trial.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.645
Peyton: Hey,
you're not on trial.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.780
It's just that you've changed
so drastically since
that night on the lake.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.216
In the six years
we lived together,
you've been this force,

04:44.218 --> 04:47.352
This unstoppable,
hyper-focused fireball.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.921
Now you just watch tv all day
while lying on the couch.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.023
Like you're in a hospice.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.858
This is the first time
you're not volunteering

04:52.860 --> 04:54.993
For the children's hospital
haunted house.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.728
And you know
how important that is to me.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.831
Okay, i see that
this isn't potluck tuesday.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.266
It's an intervention.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.701
-Told you she'd figure it out.
-(sighs)

05:02.703 --> 05:04.970
Okay, i'll...
I'll just say it.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.139
We think you have ptsd.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.342
You go to a boat party
and a bunch of crazy drunks
start killing each other.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.810
And then the fire...

05:11.812 --> 05:14.413
I can't even imagine
what you must've seen.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.982
We think you need
professional help though.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.885
I really don't.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.655
But i will try to come down
and help out
at the haunted house.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.157
I've gotta get to work.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.861
<i>Liv:
 They want to help, i get it.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:32.864
<i> But my burden is of
 the bear-it-alone variety.</i>

05:32.866 --> 05:35.867
<i> The really annoying thing
 is how right they are.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:37.302
<i> But i don't have
 post-traumatic stress.</i>

05:38.238 --> 05:40.505
<i> I have post-traumatic ennui.</i>

05:40.507 --> 05:42.174
<i> Post-traumatic defeatism.</i>

05:42.176 --> 05:43.875
<i> Post-traumatic
 "what's the point?"</i>

05:43.877 --> 05:45.577
Mmm.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.879
You have to see
this anterior rectus
sheath contusion.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.183
It looks exactly like
the virgin mary
holding a les paul.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.851
It would be wrong of me
to instagram that.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.753
Liv: Yes, it would.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.591
So, in the five months
you've been here,

05:59.593 --> 06:01.193
What's the weirdest thing
you've seen?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.428
You drinking cereal milk
over a corpse.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.898
I like that you always keep
it under 15 syllables.
It gives us a good rhythm.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.801
<i>Working with my last resident
was like prepping for
the  newlywed game.</i>

06:09.803 --> 06:11.336
"oh, what's
your favorite color?"

06:11.338 --> 06:13.071
"how old were you when
you first touched a boob?"

06:13.073 --> 06:15.173
It's nice to know
i can dissect
a jane doe's spleen

06:15.175 --> 06:17.442
Without feeling obligated
to list my top
desert island albums.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.944
She's a jane doe?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.779
She was found in the back
of a garbage truck.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.848
Driver isn't sure
where he picked her up.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.916
No id,
no matching prints so far.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.919
The garbage truck
was using a crusher, so that
complicates cause of death.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.454
(cell phone chimes and buzzes)

06:29.990 --> 06:31.757
Duty calls.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.392
-(beeps)
-suicide.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.361
Or was it murder?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.897
Sew her back up,
bag her and box her.

06:43.971 --> 06:47.239
<i>Liv:  It's probably wrong
 that every time i see
 a dead body i think,</i>

06:47.241 --> 06:49.241
<i> "what the hell
 am i doing with my life?"</i>

06:49.243 --> 06:51.610
(whirring)

06:51.612 --> 06:55.680
<i> I didn't map out
 and color code
 a 10-year plan for this.</i>

06:57.551 --> 07:01.386
<i> This is not me going
 confidently in the direction
 of my dreams.</i>

07:02.489 --> 07:04.456
<i> I used to have ambition.</i>

07:04.458 --> 07:07.993
<i> I used to be passionate,
 inspired...</i>

07:10.397 --> 07:11.963
<i> Alive.</i>

07:14.668 --> 07:16.968
<i> Now, i'm mostly just hungry.</i>

07:18.439 --> 07:21.606
<i> Oh, and a zombie.
 So, there's that.</i>

07:21.975 --> 07:23.542
(sighs)

07:24.178 --> 07:25.844
(tv playing)

07:31.518 --> 07:33.652
I have so many questions.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.288
First, why the hot sauce?
Is that a zombie thing?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.723
(gulps)

07:45.432 --> 07:48.033
Everyone knows
the party line for the lake
washington massacre.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.001
Drugged-up college kids.
Violent fight breaks out.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.503
The only survivors are
the ones smart enough

07:51.505 --> 07:53.038
To jump ship
before the fire started.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.140
But i was on duty that night.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.675
Open.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.878
Ah, you see, many of
the victims were missing
significant brain mass.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.347
My colleagues attributed
this to the fish in the lake.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.717
Because we all know
rainbow trout
go right for the cranium.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.853
Fish. I mean, it was
right there in front of them.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.021
A virus, like rabies,
but not. Something worse.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.325
I'm sorry, i'm confused.
Am i fired
or getting a physical?

08:13.327 --> 08:16.628
Fired? I have like
a billon questions for you.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.563
I'm contemplating
asking you to move in.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.031
How long have you suspected?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.334
Since raoul cortez.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.903
The gangbanger,
gunshot victim?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.638
You finished
the autopsy for me.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.040
Well, the detective on
his case needed me
to open him back up.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.542
Guess what he was missing?

08:30.544 --> 08:32.744
-A strong male role model?
-And a half-pound of brain.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.514
See, after i confirmed
that you were a survivor
of the massacre,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.917
I started, you know,
opening all the bodies
you finished off for me.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.352
Resting heart rate.
(chuckles)
ten beats per minute.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.988
How have you been
so normal to me?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.990
What am i supposed to be?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.659
Freaked out?
Leading torch-wielding
villagers to my apartment?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.961
I've been terrified about
somebody finding out
about me for months

08:49.963 --> 08:52.464
And you're acting
like it's the measles
i've contracted.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.133
-So, you know,
no one else knows?
-God, no.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.801
I mean, that must be hard.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.971
You know, dealing with this
on your own.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.439
Did you know
i used to work for the cdc?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.841
I got canned.
Wanna know why?

09:02.843 --> 09:04.009
Because you believe
in zombies?

09:04.011 --> 09:06.311
They got tired of my warnings.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.581
A nuclear war
or an asteroid strike is bad,

09:09.583 --> 09:12.517
But the most urgent issue
facing humanity?

09:12.519 --> 09:15.320
Man-made plague.
Biological warfare.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.824
See, that night on the lake,
people were doing this new
designer drug called utopium.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.027
-Did you partake?
-No!

09:22.029 --> 09:24.596
The irony is
i don't even go to parties
with regular drugs,

09:24.598 --> 09:27.532
Let alone fancy
new designer drugs.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.301
(rap music playing)

09:33.240 --> 09:35.974
Hey! You looking to party?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.742
This is utopium.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.979
It'll fry your brain,
dip it in batter
and fry it again.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.749
Having my brain
treated like a corn dog.
Not so tempting.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.585
You're pretty tempting.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.119
(gasps)

09:48.989 --> 09:51.957
(people screaming)

09:51.959 --> 09:53.258
That's when
all hell broke loose.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.359
Do tell.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.895
(all screaming)

10:07.874 --> 10:09.441
(coughs)

10:09.443 --> 10:10.775
(breathing heavily)

10:14.815 --> 10:18.149
The emt was too upset
about having accidentally
bagged a "living" girl

10:18.151 --> 10:20.085
To ponder
any other possibilities.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.821
With your current condition,
certainly makes
drawing blood a challenge.

10:22.823 --> 10:27.125
Just so you know,
regarding my unique
dietary needs...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.127
I do it as infrequently
as possible.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.564
If i don't eat
i become dumber,
meaner.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.633
And i'm afraid that
if i let it go long enough,

10:34.635 --> 10:37.035
-I'll go all george romero.
-The hot sauce?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.738
Pretty much the only way
i can taste anything
is if it has at least

10:39.740 --> 10:41.906
Six chili peppers
next to it on a menu.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.241
The weirdest thing of all...

10:43.243 --> 10:46.244
Dr. Death.
What's the story with
my jane doe?

10:46.246 --> 10:47.312
You id her yet?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.880
Uh, not yet, detective.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.249
Uh, we ran her prints
through system
and got nothing back.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.018
I'll process
her dental records next.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.986
Did you find anything
in the dumpster
that can help us?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.688
Please say vomit.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.123
These.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.458
They aren't police issue.
They're novelty.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.464
Officer: I am arresting you
for shoplifting.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.134
You have the right to
retain counsel without delay.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.637
You have the right to free
and immediate legal advice
from duty counsel.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.440
Your report said
cause of death
was blunt force trauma.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.876
You sure it wasn't
just a garbage can
crushing the skull?

11:17.878 --> 11:21.579
Shoplifting. In canada.

11:21.581 --> 11:25.283
She was arrested
for shoplifting in
vancouver in 2008.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.886
And you know this because...

11:27.888 --> 11:30.221
That's when obama was elected.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.491
It was just a hunch.
Forget it.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.627
Ah, that's a pretty
specific hunch.

11:35.629 --> 11:38.763
Detective babineaux,
my resident, olivia moore.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.232
Um, i think
liv's not feeling well.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.934
Could it be something you ate?

11:42.936 --> 11:46.638
So, what?
Did she have moosehead
in the bloodstream?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.940
"i heart shoplifting" tattoo?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.775
-Well...
-Stefani germanotta!

11:51.878 --> 11:53.311
(scoffs)

11:53.313 --> 11:56.715
Arrested november 6th, 2008,
in vancouver for shoplifting.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.851
The prints match.
This is our girl.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.053
Are y'all screwing around
with me?

12:02.055 --> 12:05.657
How did you know that?
I want a straight answer.

12:05.659 --> 12:09.494
Liv's... A psychic.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.501
Ish...

12:17.738 --> 12:19.337
(chuckles)

12:19.339 --> 12:21.606
Fine.
That's how we'll play it.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.441
Everyone screws
with the new guy.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.680
(chuckles)

12:31.785 --> 12:33.485
Tell me that was
brain-related.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.986
It's one of the side-effects.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.589
When i eat a brain
i get visions.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.024
Flashes of memories,
or dreams.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.626
I don't know
exactly what they are,

12:41.628 --> 12:43.228
But it feels like being on
somebody else's acid trip.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.531
Do you mind

12:46.533 --> 12:50.702
If i run a cognitive
evaluation before
the end of your shift?

12:50.704 --> 12:52.971
And maybe get
a few saliva samples?

12:52.973 --> 12:55.907
Mind? It's what i live for.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.913
<i>Liv:  They call death
 the eternal sleep.</i>

13:01.915 --> 13:04.315
<i> But i haven't slept
 in five months.</i>

13:04.317 --> 13:07.452
<i> I tortured myself
 obsessing over every
 worst-case scenario,</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:10.188
<i> Like my best friend
 catching me eating brains,</i>

13:10.190 --> 13:14.559
<i> Or my brother being consumed
 in a zombie apocalypse
 i unwittingly bring on.</i>

13:14.561 --> 13:16.394
<i> But it's not like
 i can talk it out</i>

13:16.396 --> 13:19.364
<i> Or confide in my loved ones
 about what's going on with me.</i>

13:19.366 --> 13:21.933
<i> I have no idea
 who i am anymore.</i>

13:21.935 --> 13:24.302
<i> What purpose, if any, i serve.</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:29.073
<i> But the real question is
 why do i suddenly,</i>

13:29.075 --> 13:32.277
<i> Desperately need a handful
 of plastic eyeballs?</i>

13:34.014 --> 13:35.814
Peyton: Well...

13:35.816 --> 13:38.349
Look who decided
to join the human race.
(chuckles)

13:38.351 --> 13:40.885
What station do you want?
Tombstones? Blood splatter?

13:40.887 --> 13:42.453
I don't really care.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.958
Kind of your personal
motto lately.

13:46.960 --> 13:51.930
Liv! Oh! I can't tell you
how happy it makes me
to see you here.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.366
Let's see, where to put you?
Where to put you, um...

13:55.368 --> 13:56.801
Why don't you grab a hammer

13:56.803 --> 13:59.370
And head over to where
they're building
the mad scientist's lab?

13:59.372 --> 14:02.373
Oh! Over there
with my ex-fiance?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.108
Sly, mom.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.277
How about i paint
tombstones instead?

14:07.814 --> 14:09.848
I genuinely don't understand
you anymore.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.323
<i>Liv:  Sorry, mom.
 No way in hell</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:20.625
<i> I'm risking giving
 the man i love zombie.</i>

14:21.494 --> 14:23.194
(woman screaming)

14:26.299 --> 14:27.498
(woman screaming)

14:27.500 --> 14:30.235
Here's johnny!

14:31.137 --> 14:32.403
(gasps)

14:34.241 --> 14:36.174
<i>Tv announcer:  Kstw news.</i>

14:36.176 --> 14:39.911
<i> Johnny frost with
 up-to-the-minute weather.</i>

14:39.913 --> 14:43.214
You saw
"kstw's own johnny frost"
murder our jane doe?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.649
Just the pre-murder part.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.451
You have to tell
detective babineaux.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.053
I was kind of hoping
you could do that.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.756
You're the one who told him
i was a psychic.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.958
I'm having a hard enough time
pretending i'm alive,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.394
Let alone throwing
a performance as a psychic
into my repertoire.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.896
Liv.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.964
You ate the girl's
temporal lobe.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.467
Going to the police
with her potential murderer
is the least you can do.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.534
You're not
in vice anymore, babineaux.
This is homicide.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.803
-Time to step up your game.
-(man laughing)

15:39.806 --> 15:41.372
(clive exhales)

15:44.577 --> 15:48.079
Miss cleo. Tell me,
is my day going to get worse?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.682
-Hell if i know.
-Yeah, that's what i thought.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.583
Look, i saw something
i thought
you should know about.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.386
Oh, saw with your eyes
or saw with your "gift"?

15:55.388 --> 15:59.290
<i>Cops: (singing)
 â™ª ah-ah-ah
 gaga-ooh-la-la â™ª</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:01.259
(all tittering)

16:01.261 --> 16:03.928
I think those guys
want your bad romance.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.965
Unless singing gaga
around the station
is a cop thing.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.368
Only after one of
their peers proudly reports
stefani germanotta

16:10.370 --> 16:13.237
As the name of
the murder victim.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.641
That name you gave me
is lady gaga's real name.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.209
-So you know...
-Oh.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.813
The jane doe must've
given that name to the police

16:21.815 --> 16:24.415
When she was arrested
in vancouver.
It's still the girl.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.485
Been in homicide
two months
without a collar.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.821
Lieutenant's breathing
down my neck,
and i'm back to square one.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.457
Like i said,
i saw something.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.624
I think
i saw who killed her.

16:34.561 --> 16:38.162
That's great. Do tell.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.999
I'll pick him up,
maybe grab some lunch.
(sniffs)

16:41.001 --> 16:43.768
What'd you say
his name was again?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.303
Johnny frost.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.506
The weather man
for channel 11?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.974
Look, i brought
the info to you,

16:49.976 --> 16:51.876
You can do with it
what you will.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.745
So, you just
come up in here,

16:53.747 --> 16:55.480
Dump a pile
of crazy on my lap

16:55.482 --> 16:58.816
And expect me to
put my reputation on the line
by grilling this guy?

16:58.818 --> 17:00.985
Yeah, i guess. Bye.

17:00.987 --> 17:05.656
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not gonna work like that.

17:05.657 --> 17:09.460
Let's you and me
go talk to the weatherman.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.663
Wait. Me?

17:12.665 --> 17:13.865
What?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.772
And that high pressure system

17:21.775 --> 17:23.741
Is gonna move
right through here

17:23.742 --> 17:26.877
And with it comes
the cuddle-up weather, folks.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.681
Start making that hot cocoa.
We're talking low 50s.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.250
-Man: That's great, johnny.
That's great.
-(bell dings)

17:32.252 --> 17:35.887
Yep. That is definitely
the guy from my vision.
Can i go now?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.822
Oh, hell no.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.058
We're about to know
whether you're the real deal
or a one-trick pony.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.894
Oh, what? You're gonna say,
"my psychic friend here
says you're a murderer.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.195
"sign this confession."

17:44.197 --> 17:45.763
-Nope. Won't need to.
-(unzips)

17:45.765 --> 17:47.198
When he sees this photo,

17:47.200 --> 17:50.301
His reaction will let us know
how psychic you really are.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.070
Excuse me, mr. Frost.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.305
Oh. Happy to!
Who do i make it out to?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.441
Seattle police department.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.782
I take it you know her.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.651
I don't.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.520
Any more questions,
you can ask
with my lawyer present.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.090
You could use some sun,
young lady.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.093
"here's johnny!"

18:19.499 --> 18:20.898
Did she record our sessions?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.735
Look.
I am a beloved public figure.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.538
Isn't there something
we could do to just
make this go away?

18:27.540 --> 18:31.075
Generally speaking,
murder isn't something
we just let slide.

18:31.077 --> 18:35.113
Murder? Tatiana's dead?

18:35.115 --> 18:37.081
Can you account
for your whereabouts
monday evening?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.549
I was here,

18:38.551 --> 18:41.119
On live tv at 6:00 and 11:00
doing the weather.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.020
I have 100,000
eye witnesses.

18:43.022 --> 18:47.725
I'm gonna need you
to tell me everything
you know about tatiana.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.894
Johnny: See, role playing.

18:49.896 --> 18:53.397
The trophy wife
and the intruder was one
of our go-tos.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.765
How do you even
know about this?

18:55.535 --> 18:56.868
Did you talk to tess?

18:56.870 --> 18:58.769
-Who's tess?
-Her friend.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.143
-Have they worked
together a lot?
-I don't know.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.411
I only doubled the fun
once on my birthday.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.946
Clive:
You have an address for her?

19:08.948 --> 19:11.215
It's not like i sent her
a christmas card.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.351
Clive: Call me if you think
of anything else.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.823
I guess i should be grateful
there's only one of me.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.292
If my zombie movie research
has taught me anything,

19:21.294 --> 19:24.795
It's that being part of
a horde would suck.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.598
Are you sure about
being the only one?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.033
There were other survivors.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.568
I'm not positive.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.203
It's one of the things
that keeps me up at night.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.905
But it's been five months,

19:33.907 --> 19:35.840
I feel like there'd be
some buzz on the street

19:35.842 --> 19:37.341
If we were
mid-zombie apocalypse.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.410
Clive: Zombies!

19:39.412 --> 19:42.113
I would be a dangerous man
after the zombies came.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.782
I wouldn't be making
any rookie mistakes.

19:44.784 --> 19:48.085
Is that a scratch
on my grandmother?
Blam!

19:49.289 --> 19:51.189
<i> Hasta la vista, mee-ma.</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:53.591
-Chivalry is dead.
-But clive's alive.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.694
You got an hour?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.130
To do that voodoo that you do.

19:59.132 --> 20:01.032
I haven't had
any more visions.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.700
You said they were triggered
when you saw the stuff

20:02.702 --> 20:04.468
The victim saw,
heard or smelled,

20:04.470 --> 20:07.405
So i made an appointment
with tatiana's friend tess.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.340
So...

20:09.342 --> 20:11.876
So, i need you
to come with me and smell,
look and listen.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.010
It won't take long,
just a couple of sniffs

20:13.012 --> 20:14.478
And a quick look-see,

20:14.480 --> 20:16.781
Then it's back to your lair,
dark princess.

20:16.783 --> 20:20.985
-Say what?
-'cause you know,
you're all...

20:20.987 --> 20:24.355
(stammering)
i don't know what you are.
Emo? Goth?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.390
Which is the one
who's too tortured
to go on living?

20:26.392 --> 20:30.027
What i am is a doctor
who is too busy
to do your job for you.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.263
You're a doctor
who is watching a movie.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.431
You should go.

20:35.301 --> 20:38.536
Technically, helping
with the investigation
is part of the job.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.107
(sighs)

20:44.777 --> 20:46.744
This tess girl also has
a clean record.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.679
I mean, that's two girls
who come up on the first page

20:48.681 --> 20:50.915
Of an internet search
for seattle escorts

20:50.917 --> 20:52.850
And not an arrest
between them.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.719
Well, maybe cops
should google more.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.922
See, that's what
i'm talking about.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.725
That whole "whatever" vibe?
I mean, what's with that?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.493
Why are you so concerned
with my vibe?

21:02.495 --> 21:03.894
I find it perplexing.

21:03.896 --> 21:07.064
I'm standing in a hallway
waiting to smell a call girl.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.066
This is vibe appropriate.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.903
-Ma'am.
-Mmm.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.174
Costs double for two.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.076
Oh, sorry, no english.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.612
(speaking foreign language)

21:32.625 --> 21:35.393
-What is that? Russian?
-Romanian.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.396
Romanian mean girl.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.298
What do you want, cop?
I'm busy.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.700
Well, i know for a fact
you've got the next hour free.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.101
I booked your time.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.506
Everything okay, tess?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.841
They hassling you?
She has rights.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.743
It's okay, truman.
Go back inside.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.813
Thank you for
your citizenship.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.553
We're here to ask
about a business associate
of yours, tatiana.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.188
(scoffs) tatiana!

22:04.190 --> 22:05.456
What has she done
this time, huh?

22:06.826 --> 22:10.161
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
tatiana is dead.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.830
She was murdered.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.467
When was the last time
you saw her?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.137
I don't know anything.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.009
Whoa!

22:25.011 --> 22:27.144
Miss...
Miss, please come out
and talk to us.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.213
We could use your help.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.949
-Did you work with her
on the night of the 16th?
-(tess sobbing)

22:31.951 --> 22:35.419
We don't even have a full
name for tatiana, tess.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.888
Her family needs
to be notified.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.790
Is that her real name?

22:43.262 --> 22:44.862
Tess: Tatiana korzha.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.267
Clive:
This is tatiana's place?

22:50.269 --> 22:54.105
Do you know how many people
i'd have to sleep with
to afford this neighborhood?

22:56.376 --> 23:00.010
I know what she was,
but she always
paid her rent on time.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.214
Oh, my!

23:04.917 --> 23:07.318
Thank you.
We'll take it from here.

23:13.159 --> 23:16.560
Do whatever you do.
Just try not to move things
around too much.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.235
Whoever ransacked this place
left tatiana's purse.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.070
Stereo, tv.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.439
It wasn't a robbery.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.742
Here's her phone.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.778
Tess called her
the day she died.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.880
The 16th, right?

23:38.551 --> 23:40.317
(tess speaking romanian)

23:40.319 --> 23:41.919
It's for you.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.589
(plays again)

23:45.591 --> 23:50.294
"hey, you little klepto,
get your ass
back up to the suite.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.896
"or we are never gonna work
with you again."

23:51.898 --> 23:53.864
"we"?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.232
So, there was another
girl there that night.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.700
(beeps)

23:56.702 --> 23:58.803
-It sounds like tatiana
stole something.
-Look at all this crap.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.905
Klepto starts to make sense.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.077
<i>Liv:  So much sense.</i>

24:07.079 --> 24:10.881
<i> Eating tatiana's brain
 didn't just give me
 some of her memories,</i>

24:10.883 --> 24:15.453
<i> It gave me kleptomania
 and the ability
 to speak romanian.</i>

24:15.455 --> 24:18.222
<i> Huh. So "you are what you eat"
 isn't just a bitchy thing</i>

24:18.224 --> 24:19.790
<i> My mother says
 about fat people.</i>

24:24.764 --> 24:28.032
Tatiana: I don't have it!
It's not here!

24:28.034 --> 24:30.501
Man: Where's my friggin' ring?
I know you have it!

24:30.503 --> 24:32.870
Tatiana: Please...
My foot is slipping!

24:33.673 --> 24:35.606
(tatiana screaming)

24:36.676 --> 24:39.844
-(gasping)
-hey. You okay?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.714
I just saw her die.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.684
We need to find who did this
and nail his ass to the wall.

24:55.194 --> 24:59.063
<i>Liv:  So, some psychotic
 bastard tripled the fun
 with three call girls</i>

24:59.065 --> 25:01.265
<i> And is willing to murder
 to get his stolen ring back?</i>

25:01.267 --> 25:02.433
(pounding on door)

25:04.604 --> 25:07.104
She's gone.
Whatever you told her
sent her running.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.572
It's her body, you know.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.007
Did she say
where she was going?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.375
Like i'm gonna tell you.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.077
Hey! Karl marx!

25:13.079 --> 25:14.578
There's one girl dead already.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.180
We're trying to stop
that number from going up.

25:17.316 --> 25:18.782
Oh, god. Uh...

25:18.784 --> 25:20.584
Tess didn't say
where she was going.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.921
She had a couple of suitcases,
and she asked me
to pick up her mail. Um...

25:23.923 --> 25:25.723
Sorry about the other girl.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.892
Wait,
it wasn't monica, was it?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.293
Monica?

25:29.295 --> 25:31.462
Uh, friend of tess'.
She came around here a lot.

25:31.464 --> 25:34.064
-They work together?
-I hope not.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.966
Well, she seemed
like a kid to me.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.635
I never thought
of her in that way.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.637
Sure you didn't.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.840
Monica's listed under
tatiana's other friends.
Is this her?

25:44.010 --> 25:45.242
Truman: Yeah.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.715
Yo! Dirty debbie harry!
Slow your roll.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.551
I'm supposed to be at work,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.920
And i'm afraid i'm gonna
find this monica girl waiting
in a drawer for me.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.788
We've gotta do something.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.758
What happened to,
"do with it what you will"?
Where's that girl?

26:00.760 --> 26:03.894
When tatiana was
falling to her death,
i could feel it.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.031
She knew
she was gonna die.
It's personal now.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.334
Okay. We're gonna find her.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.803
I would've heard
if a new body had turned up.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.706
I'll track down her address.
You think your boss
will let you come with me?

26:15.708 --> 26:18.075
I have very little doubt
about that.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.847
Yeah, when internal affairs
asked me about chest poking...

26:23.849 --> 26:25.049
I saw nothing.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.586
Of course you can
help the detective.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.022
A call girl gets murdered,
you eat her brains,
help find her killer.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.724
It's like that
elton john song.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.426
<i> Philadelphia freedom?</i>

26:35.428 --> 26:37.428
<i>The one from  the lion king.</i>

26:37.430 --> 26:42.266
<i>Yes, sir elton specifically
references dead call girls
in  the circle of life.</i>

26:42.268 --> 26:46.036
-O.M. Is that me?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.605
And you're giving me e.Coli?

26:47.607 --> 26:49.773
I'm treating your blood
with different bacteria.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.976
It's all just
preliminary research.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.712
If you want to find a cure
you have to know how
a disease defends itself.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.180
The more scenarios
you expose it to

26:56.182 --> 26:57.481
The more you know
how it works.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.016
Wait. You think
you can cure this?

26:59.018 --> 27:00.751
(exhales)

27:00.753 --> 27:04.922
It could take years.
It's an uphill battle
but so was polio.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.925
Why did you think
i was running all those tests?

27:07.927 --> 27:11.328
What... You were expecting
to stay like this forever?

27:12.798 --> 27:15.265
<i>Liv:  As a matter of fact,
 i was.</i>

27:16.168 --> 27:18.502
Great. Thank you, sergeant.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.671
(beeps)

27:20.673 --> 27:23.173
I got an address for monica.
Let's roll.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.743
Sorry. Something's come up.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.145
There's this thing
i need to do.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.349
Wait, that's it?

27:32.351 --> 27:33.784
Thought i had
a psychic sidekick.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.986
I was working on the bit...

27:35.988 --> 27:37.521
Cagney and pasty.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.990
(thunder rumbling)

27:43.095 --> 27:46.530
<i>Liv:  Major wanted to know
 if there was a chance for us.</i>

27:46.532 --> 27:48.799
<i> I thought shutting him down
 was noble.</i>

27:56.442 --> 27:58.375
<i> But what if there is hope?</i>

28:03.849 --> 28:07.284
<i> Even if it's dim
 and somewhere in
 the nebulous future,</i>

28:13.626 --> 28:16.493
<i> It's a hope i need
 in order to survive.</i>

28:20.866 --> 28:23.233
<i> But what about
 what major needs?</i>

28:23.235 --> 28:26.870
<i> Can i really ask him
 to wait for a day
 that may never come?</i>

28:27.840 --> 28:29.740
(woman laughing)

28:44.356 --> 28:45.422
(woman laughs)

29:02.074 --> 29:05.075
<i>Liv:  When you die,
 life goes on without you.</i>

29:05.077 --> 29:08.412
<i> If you're among
 the living dead,
 you're around to watch.</i>

29:08.414 --> 29:11.682
<i> Giving up my dream
 of becoming a heart surgeon
 was depressing.</i>

29:11.684 --> 29:14.351
<i> Eating brains sucks
 beyond words.</i>

29:14.353 --> 29:17.421
<i> But seeing major
 possibly moving on
 with someone else?</i>

29:17.423 --> 29:19.323
<i> That's my threshold.</i>

29:19.325 --> 29:21.191
<i> That's the soul crusher.</i>

29:23.763 --> 29:25.462
You wanted to see me,
lieutenant?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.798
Pratt here has a ci who's
got a lead on the dead girl.

29:28.868 --> 29:31.001
He's gonna run the case
from here on out.

29:31.704 --> 29:34.471
But i'm so close, sir.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.774
The killer was one
of tatiana's johns.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.109
The john's ring was stolen,
and he killed her
trying to get it back.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.978
Only she didn't have it.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.147
I've got a witness that says
one of them got out of dodge
with a suitcase,

29:43.149 --> 29:44.848
And it looks like
the other one left
with her dog.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.183
Three call girls?

29:46.185 --> 29:48.552
Who are we looking for,
superman? Ron jeremy?

29:49.421 --> 29:51.221
I've got leads on the girls.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.690
One of them is enrolled at one
of those online colleges.

29:53.692 --> 29:56.393
She logged into
her economics class
an hour ago.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.995
I've got an ip address.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.265
The nerds in computer
forensics are working on
a location for me.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.567
Sir, we need
to find these girls
before the killer does.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.037
Well, maybe pratt
will let you tag along

30:07.039 --> 30:09.540
If that address
amounts to anything.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.744
(sighing)

30:14.647 --> 30:17.047
-Babineaux.
-Yeah.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.487
I'm sorry about that, man.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.690
Low guy on the totem pole
always gets boned, right?

30:26.692 --> 30:28.625
But hey, it'll make it
that much sweeter

30:28.627 --> 30:31.762
When you bag
your first collar, right?

30:31.764 --> 30:34.498
(clears throat)
look, do me a favor.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.467
Follow up on some
of your interviews.
Talk to the weatherman.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.803
Have another conversation
with tess' neighbor.

30:39.805 --> 30:42.105
Please, i appreciate it.

30:42.107 --> 30:43.707
Mmm, all right.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.409
Thank you.

30:49.715 --> 30:52.149
(woman talking
indistinctly on tv)

30:55.955 --> 30:58.622
<i>Liv:  Seizing the day
 is for suckers.</i>

31:03.095 --> 31:04.995
Weird question,
have you seen my pens?

31:06.799 --> 31:08.498
Oh.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.440
Great, thanks.

31:19.078 --> 31:23.614
(woman speaking
indistinctly on tv)

31:23.616 --> 31:25.148
(chuckles)

31:26.418 --> 31:28.585
I so wanna write you off.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.188
I so wanna be in that

31:31.190 --> 31:32.522
"you can't help those who
don't help themselves" place.

31:32.524 --> 31:36.126
But, despite all of this...

31:38.864 --> 31:40.964
You're my freakin' heart.

31:40.966 --> 31:44.134
So, if you could step up,
i'd appreciate it.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.269
(sighs)

31:48.507 --> 31:49.973
Okay.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.478
(inhales)

31:59.952 --> 32:02.386
<i>Liv:
 I can't refuse to be dead.</i>

32:02.388 --> 32:08.592
<i> I can't eat a ham sandwich
 and feel like
 a sated normal human being.</i>

32:08.594 --> 32:12.763
<i> I can't have sex,
 or tell the people i love
 what's going on with me,</i>

32:12.765 --> 32:18.068
<i> But i can choose not to have
 a drawer full of fake eyeballs
 and strangers' tchotchkes.</i>

32:18.070 --> 32:20.537
<i> I can choose to be
 a decent person.</i>

32:22.975 --> 32:26.543
<i> I can choose to help
 find justice for
 a fellow dead girl.</i>

32:40.259 --> 32:42.559
Ma'am? Can i help you?

32:42.561 --> 32:44.361
Uh, i'm from
the me's office.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.029
I wanted to see
detective babineaux.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.597
Um, i'm sorry, he's out.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.467
I've got, uh, computer
forensics on the line
for babineaux.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.636
They got that address
for those girls.

32:53.906 --> 32:56.807
This is pratt. Uh-huh.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.243
Great, thank you.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.646
Um, do you want me
to leave him a message?

33:02.648 --> 33:03.780
I'm good.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.082
Okay.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.962
Hey. Just looking for you.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.464
Yeah, i'm sure
you're incredibly busy, but...

33:20.466 --> 33:22.766
No, i'm not.
I'm back on the case.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.435
What do you need?

33:25.437 --> 33:29.406
Johnny frost said
tatiana had
a babbos daypork,

33:29.408 --> 33:30.774
Or deerpork,
something like that.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.410
<i>-You mean  barbos de porc?
-Oh, okay.</i>

33:33.412 --> 33:35.746
It means "bearded pig."

33:35.748 --> 33:37.647
Tatiana had a bearded pig.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.815
You sure
you're saying that right?

33:38.817 --> 33:42.886
No, that can't be it.
Wait...

33:46.025 --> 33:48.358
Son of a bitch.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.161
That's why none of the girls
have a record.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.663
He's a cop.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.665
A bearded cop. It's pratt.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.502
There's no ci.
He wanted me off the case
before i solved it.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.771
Wait, is pratt the detective
who sits one desk
over from you?

34:00.773 --> 34:02.839
-Yeah.
-He knows where the girls are.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.408
He has the address.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.081
Damn! That really works.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.859
Clive:
What do you not understand?

34:22.860 --> 34:25.362
I need immediate backup.
These girls
are in real danger.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.464
<i>Dispatch:  I'll pass along
 your message, detective.</i>

34:27.466 --> 34:33.036
Controlling, relentless,
vindictive,
schizo crazy bitch.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.974
My wife is like satan
with a fat ass.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.342
If she comes home
from boca

34:39.344 --> 34:41.710
And i don't have
my wedding ring...

34:41.713 --> 34:43.380
(whistling)

34:43.382 --> 34:46.149
Did i mention it was
her grandpa's ring?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.251
You want to hear
the gory details that the ring
survived dachau

34:48.253 --> 34:49.853
And her grandfather did not?

34:49.855 --> 34:51.288
(chuckles)

34:53.092 --> 34:54.991
(both gasping)

34:54.993 --> 34:57.160
Which one of you ladies
is gonna tell me
where my ring is?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.896
You'd be my favorite.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.100
Clive: There's pratt's car.

35:04.670 --> 35:09.039
I don't want to get any closer
in case he hears us.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.774
-Stay here.
-What else am i gonna to do?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.577
Subdue him with
a good verbal flogging?

35:13.579 --> 35:16.046
I'm just saying,
don't get intrepid.

35:18.984 --> 35:21.685
(sobbing) tatiana was always
stealing things.
She couldn't help it.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.754
Yes, you told me that.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.858
But she didn't have it.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.928
I saw the look in her eye.

35:34.066 --> 35:36.600
(shouting) where is my ring?

35:36.602 --> 35:38.702
-I pawned it!
-(softly) monica!

35:40.172 --> 35:41.471
Monica: I needed
the money for school,

35:41.473 --> 35:42.806
And i knew tatiana
would take the blame

35:42.808 --> 35:44.341
Because she steals things.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.778
You do see how
this is your fault?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.847
I am not gonna live
in a one-room apartment

35:50.849 --> 35:53.116
While my wife
gets half my salary!

35:53.118 --> 35:56.586
You killed tatiana!
You did!
I didn't want this.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.023
(gasping)

36:07.833 --> 36:09.232
(women screaming)

36:11.904 --> 36:13.570
Upstairs!
He ran upstairs!

36:30.923 --> 36:32.155
(seatbelt clicks)

36:36.461 --> 36:38.929
No. No, no, no.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.698
(engine starts)

36:41.700 --> 36:43.400
(tires squealing)

36:50.842 --> 36:52.142
Get out of the car!

36:52.144 --> 36:54.311
Get out of that car
or i'll shoot you!

36:55.681 --> 36:58.381
Get out of the car.
Get out of that car!

37:00.118 --> 37:01.851
(liv yelps)

37:07.459 --> 37:08.959
(tires screeching)

37:09.962 --> 37:11.394
(both sobbing)

37:12.464 --> 37:13.830
Clive: Liv!

37:16.134 --> 37:17.567
(panting)

37:17.569 --> 37:19.135
What the hell?

37:31.783 --> 37:33.416
(grunting)

37:37.990 --> 37:39.489
(yelling)

37:39.491 --> 37:40.857
(tires screeching)

37:41.693 --> 37:43.159
(liv yelps)

38:01.980 --> 38:03.647
(snarling)

38:04.149 --> 38:05.315
Clive: Liv!

38:12.758 --> 38:14.057
I saw you get shot.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.160
He missed.

38:17.162 --> 38:20.897
I played dead and then
i just chased after his car.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.567
Adrenaline is no joke.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.869
Too intrepid?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.337
(exhales)

38:27.339 --> 38:29.205
Way too intrepid.

38:29.207 --> 38:32.776
-Tess and monica?
-Yeah, they're okay.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.210
Why is there a bullet hole
in the roof of my car?

38:35.547 --> 38:38.648
Maybe he was celebrating
drunk cowboy style.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.917
(imitates gunshots)

38:40.919 --> 38:43.787
I don't know. Literally,
i got here like two seconds
before you did.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.956
He was about to kill them.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.225
We got here just in time.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.061
Thanks to you.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.762
And you.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.830
I mean, you drove.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.967
Seriously, how did you
solve crime before me?

38:57.969 --> 39:01.137
-I feel i'm kind of vital
to this whole operation.
-(chuckles)

39:01.139 --> 39:03.640
Want me to check him out?
I am a doctor.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.609
Go see to the girls.
I got this.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.117
You're right.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.054
This is so much sweeter.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.291
I got mad and suddenly
i was 99% zombie.

39:21.293 --> 39:25.328
<i>Like  28 days later style,
but with a side of rage bomb.</i>

39:25.330 --> 39:27.931
I was a dead,
alabaster badass.

39:27.933 --> 39:31.401
I'm performing open heart
surgery on you
without anesthesia.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.604
You're beyond badass.
There it is.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.841
(exhales) i mean,
i'd offer to stitch you up,

39:37.843 --> 39:39.843
But there isn't
even much blood.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.878
Must take the pressure off
when your patient's
already dead.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.114
Hey, you have to stop calling
yourself that.

39:44.116 --> 39:46.015
You're not dead.
You're undead.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.384
Big difference.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.719
Just think about
what you did tonight.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.688
You saved two women's lives.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.358
You got justice for another,
and you got a very bad man
off the streets.

39:55.360 --> 39:59.429
And as god is my witness,
you'll never be hungry again.

39:59.431 --> 40:04.167
Fresh brains for later.
But now, let's get to work.
Shall we?

40:10.675 --> 40:13.676
<i>Liv:  Life's short
 and then you die.</i>

40:13.678 --> 40:16.112
<i> And then... Then you have
 to make some decisions.</i>

40:16.114 --> 40:18.782
<i> You can skulk around,
 lamenting all that
 you've lost,</i>

40:18.784 --> 40:20.984
<i> Try to keep yourself
 numb and isolated.</i>

40:20.986 --> 40:22.419
<i> Or you can embrace
 who you are.</i>

40:22.421 --> 40:24.020
I heard there'd be brains.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.489
Aw, man. See,
now i want to be a zombie.

40:26.491 --> 40:30.260
It's kind of a commitment.
You gotta lock down a whole
"lifeless but crazy" stare.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.996
And then there's the
brain-eating
and the dance moves.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.397
You make an awesome zombie.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.566
-Don't i though?
-Yeah.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.235
Who wants to go scare
the crap out of some kids?

40:40.172 --> 40:41.938
(evil laughter)

40:49.448 --> 40:50.680
Have you seen your sister?

40:50.682 --> 40:52.816
She told me
she would help with tickets.

40:52.818 --> 40:56.286
Of course that would
require her to make it
off her couch.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.821
(chuckling)

40:57.823 --> 41:01.324
I don't think making it
off her couch was an issue.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.660
(laughing)

41:07.132 --> 41:09.532
<i>Liv:  I wanted to do something
 with my life.</i>

41:09.534 --> 41:11.734
<i> I wanted to help people.</i>

41:11.736 --> 41:15.071
<i> Not necessarily as
 a zombie psychic who eats
 murder victim brains,</i>

41:15.073 --> 41:16.973
<i> But still...</i>

41:16.975 --> 41:19.776
<i> I so nailed it today.</i>

41:19.778 --> 41:23.847
<i> I've spent five months
 bemoaning all that
 was taken from me.</i>

41:23.849 --> 41:27.116
<i> It never occurred to me that
 i'd have something to give.</i>

41:27.118 --> 41:28.852
<i> A way to contribute.</i>

41:28.854 --> 41:31.621
<i> A reason for being not alive.</i>

41:31.623 --> 41:32.755
(beeps)

41:32.757 --> 41:36.192
<i> To sleep,
 perchance to not dream.</i>

41:38.997 --> 41:43.366
<i> All i needed was some hope
 that there's a future
 that i fit into somehow.</i>

41:44.836 --> 41:46.469
<i> At last.</i>

41:47.339 --> 41:51.241
<i> Sweet blissful sleep.</i>

41:51.243 --> 41:53.109
(siren wailing)

42:06.124 --> 42:07.624
(grunting)

42:12.898 --> 42:14.464
(panting)
