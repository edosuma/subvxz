01:14.233 --> 01:15.600
I ENJOYED IT,
IT WAS INTERESTING.

01:15.633 --> 01:18.367
IT'S LIKE, IT WAS SUCH
A PERFECT LENGTH.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.867
THAT'S MY SPECIALTY,
LENGTH.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.533

PERSONAL REASONS ?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.067
SHE JUST SAID,
"I'VE GOT PERSONAL REASONS."

02:21.100 --> 02:22.800
YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING,

02:22.833 --> 02:25.133
NOBODY EVER HAS TO
EXPLAIN THEMSELVES.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.067
YEAH, BECAUSE
THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE

02:27.067 --> 02:28.500
THEY DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

02:28.533 --> 02:30.100
YOU SHOULD CALL
JEFF'S NEIGHBOR.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.133
WHY ?

02:31.167 --> 02:32.200
SHE'S A CATERER.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.967
OH, ALRIGHT,
WELL, WE'LL THINK--

02:34.067 --> 02:35.933
JEFF SAYS SHE'S GREAT,
DON'T DISMISS IT SO QUICKLY.

02:35.967 --> 02:37.300
WELL, IT'S JEFF.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.933
HEY, THIS GUY,
IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING,
HE KNOWS FOOD.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.533
BELIEVE ME, YOU COULD
TRUST HIM ON FOOD.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.067
ALRIGHT, WELL,

02:43.067 --> 02:45.067
HE THINKS
SHE'S GREAT, YEAH.

WELL, WE'RE IN
DIRE STRAITS, FINE.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.567
CALL JEFF'S NEIGHBOR.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.467
THE CATERER.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500

03:14.533 --> 03:18.500
WELL, I THINK
SHE REALLY LIKED IT.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.567
OH, REALLY ?

03:19.600 --> 03:20.667
YEAH.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.067
DO ME A FAVOR,
WILL YA ?

03:22.100 --> 03:25.067
PLEASE DON'T GIVE THIS TAPE
TO YOUR FRIENDS ANYMORE,

03:25.067 --> 03:26.233
THE TAPE
OF THE MOVIE.

03:26.267 --> 03:27.267
SHE SAID
SHE LIKED IT.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.500
SHE DIDN'T
LIKE THE MOVIE,

03:28.533 --> 03:30.467
"ENJOY" DOES NOT
MEAN "LIKE"--

03:30.500 --> 03:33.400
SHE WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING
THAT SHE DIDN'T MEAN.

03:33.433 --> 03:35.200
BUT SHE DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING THAT SHE SAID.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.800
YOU JUST, YOU DON'T
KNOW HER THAT WELL.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.400
MAYBE ON FRIDAY
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW HER
A LITTLE BIT BETTER--

03:39.433 --> 03:41.633
DO YOU HAVE TO HE
THIS DINNER PARTY ?

03:41.667 --> 03:43.267
WHY DO YOU DO THIS
WITH THESE DINNER PARTIES ?

03:43.300 --> 03:45.433
WHAT IS THIS COMPULSIVE,
TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER YOUR HOUSE

03:45.467 --> 03:47.667
AND SERVE THEM FOOD
AND TALK TO THEM ?

03:47.700 --> 03:51.067
IT'S FUN,
IT'S A LITTLE GATHERING,
A LITTLE PARTY.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.767
LIKE, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST SORT OF LIGHTEN UP

03:52.800 --> 03:54.233
AND HAVE
A GOOD TIME ?

03:54.267 --> 03:56.367
PEOPLE FROM BROOKLYN
DON'T WALK AROUND LIKE THAT.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.867
WE ARE
IN CALIFORNIA NOW.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.633
YOU'VE GOTTA TRY
A DIFFERENT WAY.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.567
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A LITTLE BET WITH YOU

04:01.600 --> 04:02.867
THAT I'M NOT CLOSE
TO HAVING A GOOD TIME.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.133
DO YOU WANNA
MAKE A BET ?

04:04.167 --> 04:06.167
AND I WON'T NOT HAVE
A GOOD TIME ON PURPOSE.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.267
NO, I FEEL
LIKE YOU WILL.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.667
WE'LL MAKE A BET AND SEE
IF I HAVE A GOOD TIME.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.333
YOU ALREADY DECIDED
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

04:10.367 --> 04:13.567
I DIDN'T DECIDE THAT,
I'M GONNA TRY,

04:13.600 --> 04:14.733
BUT I KNOW THAT
THAT I WON'T.

04:14.767 --> 04:15.767
I'LL MAKE A BET.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.900
BLOW JOB IN THE CAR.

04:16.933 --> 04:17.900
A BLOW JOB
IN THE CAR.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.067
OKAY.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.067
HOW 'BOUT
A SIDE BET ?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.900
DEPENDS ON
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.367
WELL, I THINK SHE'LL DIG
DOING YOUR PARTY.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.533
HER FOOD'S AWESOME.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.933
SHE'S A GREAT CATERER.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.567
YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

04:34.600 --> 04:35.700
UNTIL I MOVED
TO LOS ANGELES

04:35.733 --> 04:37.433
I WAS NEVER IN
THE SAME ROOM AS A CATERER.

04:37.467 --> 04:38.900
EVER, ONCE.

04:38.933 --> 04:42.067
YOU CAN GIVE ME
A SWANSON'S TURKEY DINNER
AND I COULD CARE LESS.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.167
THE POTATOES ARE GREAT
IN SWANSON'S TURKEY DINNER.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.067
I USED TO LIKE
THE FRIED CHICKEN ONE.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.067
OH, THAT'S GOOD TOO.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.067
YEAH,
WASN'T THAT GOOD ?

04:48.100 --> 04:49.100
MAN.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.767
ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.833
LARRY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.733
REALLY ?

04:56.767 --> 04:58.367
YEP.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.800
WHAT IS IT ?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.233
WHAT, DID
I DO SOMETHING ?

05:01.267 --> 05:02.300
YES, YOU DID.

05:02.333 --> 05:06.600
WHAT ?
WHAT DID I DO ?

05:06.633 --> 05:08.533
YOU NEVER CONGRATULATED ME
ON MY NEW CAR.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.067
WHAT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

05:13.067 --> 05:14.467
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING,
I WAS PRETTY HURT BY THAT.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.567
I NEVER CONGRATULATED YOU
ON YOUR NEW CAR ?

05:17.600 --> 05:20.100
YOU WALKED ALL THE WAY OVER
FROM YOUR DESK TO SIT HERE
TO TELL ME THAT ?

05:20.133 --> 05:23.100
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.733
IT'S NOT LIKE
HAVING A KID.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.967
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
CONGRATULATIONS
WERE IN ORDER

05:27.067 --> 05:28.067
WHEN YOU GET A NEW CAR,
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.800
THEY WERE,
THEY WERE.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.733
WELL, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR CAR.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.400
CONGRATULATIONS,
I'M SORRY.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.667

05:51.733 --> 05:53.733

ISN'T IT ?

05:54.900 --> 05:56.133
WHAT A CAR,
YEAH.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.667
NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.533
I COULD SEE WHY YOU GOT HURT
WHEN I DIDN'T CONGRATULATE YOU.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.167
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.767
ALL ORIGINAL,
EVERYTHING'S THE SAME.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.600
AMAZING,

06:07.867 --> 06:09.167
WHAT'D YOU

06:09.200 --> 06:10.367

06:10.400 --> 06:12.267
PERSONAL ?
WHAT ARE YOU, INSANE ?

06:12.300 --> 06:14.667
IT'S PERSONAL,
EVERYTHING'S PERSONAL.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.667
IT'S PERSONAL.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.067
GOD.

06:17.067 --> 06:21.667
LET'S GO BACK ALREADY,

07:30.433 --> 07:32.933

07:32.967 --> 07:35.133
IT WAS MY IDEA

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ?

07:35.167 --> 07:36.333

07:38.733 --> 07:40.800

07:44.067 --> 07:46.733
DOUBLE "A",
BEEP, BEEP, M-C-O.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.333
IT SOUNDED LIKE
HIS HORN.

08:01.133 --> 08:04.400
( male )
WE ACTUALLY JUST GOT
THE CONTRACT FOR DIET RITE

08:04.433 --> 08:06.600

08:19.633 --> 08:20.700
( Julie )
IT'S JUST BEEN,
YOU KNOW.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.200
THE BOOKS ARE SPLIT BETWEEN
COVINA AND DOWNEY,

08:23.233 --> 08:25.900
AND IT'S ABOUT
A 35, 40-MINUTE DRIVE
BETWEEN THE TWO.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.967
OH, BOY, IT'S GOTTA BE
A PAIN IN THE NECK.

08:28.067 --> 08:30.433
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CLOCK EXACTLY, YOU KNOW,

08:30.467 --> 08:33.767
HOW MUCH TIME, HOPEFULLY,
EVERYONE'S GONNA BE SAVING.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.433
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
IT IS A FEW MILES.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.200
IT'S A FEW MILES,
WELL, IT'S CLOSER

08:37.233 --> 08:40.800
AND YOU GET TO TAKE THE 710
VERSUS THE 10.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.367
HE'S MOVING
TO COVINA.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.367
WHAT'S THAT ?

08:43.400 --> 08:46.067
THEY'RE MOVING TO,
WHAT, DOWNEY ?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.167
JULIE WAS
TELLING ME THAT.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.900
IT'S LIKE A SIX MILE,
IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENCE.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.867
IT'LL SAVE US
A LOT OF TIME.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.067
WOW.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.600
IF YOU GUYS ARE EVER DOWN THERE,
YOU SHOULD SWING BY.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.067
OH, YEAH,
WE'LL GIVE YOU A TOUR.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.767
TO THE, UH,
OFFICES, YEAH.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.667
YEAH, LET'S TALK
AND FIGURE OUT A TIME.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.233
DEFINITELY.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.133
LARRY, YOU REMEMBER
ALLISON AND KEVIN.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.467
HELLO.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.767
( Cheryl )
THEY JUST WENT
ON A CRUISE.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.300
OH, LARRY, YOU GOTTA TAKE
THIS LITTLE LADY ON A CRUISE.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.567
OKAY.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.933
I KNOW WHERE I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS LITTLE LADY.

09:12.967 --> 09:13.967
EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.567
LET ME TELL YOU,
CRUISING IS,

09:16.600 --> 09:18.633
IT'S THE BEST TRIP
WE'VE EVER HAD.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.600
DID WE NOT SEE A SHOW
ON THAT BOAT.

09:21.633 --> 09:23.833
WE SAW A PRODUCTION OF
"ANNIE GET YOUR GUN"
THAT WAS SO--

09:23.867 --> 09:25.133
IT WAS BETTER THAN
ANYTHING I'VE SEEN.

09:25.167 --> 09:27.500
REALLY.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.500
THE GIRL
WHO PLAYED ANNIE, OH.

09:29.533 --> 09:30.533
THIS GIRL
WHO PLAYED ANNIE,

09:30.567 --> 09:31.600
AND WE SPENT
TIME WITH HER.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.600
ANNIE'S A LITTLE GIRL,
OR AN ADULT ?

09:33.633 --> 09:35.200
"ANNIE GET YOUR GUN",
IT'S NOT ANNIE.

09:35.233 --> 09:36.233
OH, NOT LITTLE ANNIE.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.167
NO, NOT WITH THE DOG,
NO, NO, NO.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.267
I WAS WONDERING,
SHE GONNA BE ON BOTH ?

09:40.300 --> 09:41.867
BUT THIS IS A YOUNG,
THIS WOULD BE,

09:41.900 --> 09:44.333
LIKE, KERI RUSSELL-STYLE,
YOU KNOW, FELICITY.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.967
OH, TOTALLY...

09:47.067 --> 09:48.067
HI.

09:48.067 --> 09:49.067
HOW ARE YOU
DOING ?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.100
GOOD, HOW ARE
YOU DOING ?

09:50.133 --> 09:51.100
GOOD.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.100
I WAS JUST ADMIRING
YOUR ART HERE.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.100
OH, YEAH.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.100
I'M MIKE DUFFY,
HOW ARE YOU ?

09:54.133 --> 09:55.100
MIKE, HI,
LARRY DAVID.

09:55.133 --> 09:56.733
HEY, LISTEN,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

09:56.767 --> 09:57.767
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
NICE TO
MEET YOU.

09:58.833 --> 09:59.833
UH, NICE HOUSE
YOU HAVE HERE.

09:59.867 --> 10:00.933
THANK YOU.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.867
SO, LISTEN, YOU MIND
IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION ?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.033
WE WATCH THE SEINFELD
SHOW, RIGHT ?

10:05.067 --> 10:06.533
BUT, WE DIDN'T WATCH IT
WHEN IT WAS ON,

10:06.567 --> 10:07.667
AND NOW IT'S ON
THE RERUNS...

10:07.700 --> 10:08.900
MM-HMM, RIGHT.

10:08.933 --> 10:10.833
DO YOU GET PAID EVERY
TIME THEY SHOW THAT ?

10:10.867 --> 10:13.133
YEAH.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.300
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.600
I WAS JUST THINKING
THE OTHER DAY

10:15.633 --> 10:17.500
HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE
IF AAMCO PAID ME

10:17.533 --> 10:20.567
FOR TRANSMISSIONS THAT
I FIXED SIX YEARS AGO.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.100
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD
HOW YOU JUST DID THAT.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.733
CHERYL ?

10:24.767 --> 10:28.167
HE'S VERY GOOD,
YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT
THE AAMCO THING ?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.200
( Cheryl )
NO...

10:29.233 --> 10:30.200
VERY FUNNY.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.200
I WORK FOR AAMCO.

10:31.233 --> 10:32.233
VERY FUNNY JOKE.

10:32.267 --> 10:33.867
I WORK FOR AAMCO.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.567
NO, I'M NOT
KIDDING YOU, I DO.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.500
OH, OF COURSE,
HE'S TERRIFIC.

10:37.533 --> 10:40.733
HE DOES WORK
FOR AAMCO.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.300
WHY WOULD
I MAKE THAT UP ?

10:42.333 --> 10:43.933
YOU'RE SHITTING ME,
YOU OWN AN AAMCO STATION ?

10:43.967 --> 10:45.367
YEAH, THREE OF
THEM, ACTUALLY.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.300
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.400
WHAT ?

10:48.433 --> 10:50.233
MY FRIEND GOT
THIS '57 CHEVY.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.567
OH, GREAT, '57 CHEVY,
I LOVE THOSE CARS.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.233
SO, I'M DRIVING
THE CAR

10:54.267 --> 10:57.033
AND THIS AAMCO COMMERCIAL
COMES ON THE RADIO.

10:57.067 --> 10:58.167
DOUBLE "A"...

10:58.200 --> 10:59.233
BEEP-BEEP !

10:59.267 --> 11:00.333
RIGHT,
BEEP-BEEP !

11:00.367 --> 11:01.433
YEAH, M-C-O.

11:01.467 --> 11:02.833
I THOUGHT
THE BEEPS
WERE REAL.

11:02.867 --> 11:03.967
OH, NO, NO,
IT'S IN THE COMMERCIAL.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.600
I THOUGHT THE GUY
BEHIND ME WAS BEEPING.

11:05.633 --> 11:07.100
AND SO I
TURNED AROUND,

11:07.133 --> 11:09.067
AND I STARTED
YELLING AT THE GUY.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.867
AND THEN HE STARTED
YELLING BACK AT ME,

11:10.900 --> 11:12.200
THE GUY GOT
SO PISSED OFF,

11:12.233 --> 11:13.600
HE RAMMED US FROM BEHIND
AND SPED AWAY.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.833
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

11:14.867 --> 11:17.367
AND NOW, THE CAR'S MAKING
THIS TERRIBLE NOISE.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.633
WAS THE CAR IN GEAR
WHEN HE HIT YOU ?

11:18.667 --> 11:19.667
YEAH.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.800
WELL, THAT COULD
BE SOMETHING SERIOUS.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.167
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER
HAD A '57 CHEVY.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.967
I COULD TAKE
THAT CAR APART...

11:26.067 --> 11:27.133
I'M SURE I COULD
TAKE A LOOK AT IT

11:27.167 --> 11:29.267
AND DO SOMETHING
FOR YOU, YEAH, SURE.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.467
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.733
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME A CALL ?

11:31.767 --> 11:33.467

12:30.833 --> 12:32.200
I THINK LARRY WILL
AGREE WITH ME ON THIS.

12:32.233 --> 12:35.467
WE DON'T STAND
ON TRADITION IN THIS
HOUSE, YOU KNOW ?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.733
HOWEVER, THERE IS
ONE TRADITION THAT

12:37.767 --> 12:41.733
I PARTICULARLY ENJOY,
AND PLEASE JOIN ME.

12:41.767 --> 12:42.767

13:06.867 --> 13:08.967

13:10.800 --> 13:12.367

NOW, TOO, ISN'T IT ?

13:13.433 --> 13:14.767
IS IT ?

13:14.800 --> 13:18.100
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY GET PAID
EVERY TIME IT COMES ON.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.900
SO, YOU'RE MOVING
TO COVINA, HUH ?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.800
WELL, ACTUALLY
WE'RE MOVING TO DOWNEY.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.800
I'M IN COVINA

13:24.833 --> 13:27.533
HAVE YOU BEEN DOWN
TO DOWNEY MUCH ?

13:27.567 --> 13:28.600
NO, NO.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.400
THEY ARE DOING
A LOT DOWN THERE.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.567
AND, I MEAN, WE GOT
A SWEETHEART OF A DEAL.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
REALLY.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.633
YEAH, I'VE GOT A LOT
THAT IS KIND OF ALMOST

13:36.667 --> 13:39.533
LIKE A TRAPEZOID,
AND IT BUTTS UP

13:39.567 --> 13:40.600
AGAINST
A RAILROAD TRACK.

13:40.633 --> 13:41.733
IS THAT SO ?

13:41.767 --> 13:44.300
YEAH, AND THAT ACTUALLY
BRINGS MY TAXES DOWN.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.333
OH, BOY.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.433
HEY, WHEN'S
THE NEXT MEETING

13:48.467 --> 13:50.100
OF THE YOUNG
REPUBLICAN'S CLUB ?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.933
YOU HAVE ONE PLANNED
FOR NEXT MONTH ?

13:51.967 --> 13:54.733
NO, BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY
GET THE GROUP TOGETHER...

13:54.767 --> 13:57.600
YEAH, I'D REALLY,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO.

13:57.633 --> 13:58.700
WOULD YOU ?

13:58.733 --> 13:59.767
OH, YEAH.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.233
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME ?

14:01.267 --> 14:02.500
HEY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.633
THE NEXT TIME YOU DO
ONE OF THESE THINGS,

14:04.667 --> 14:06.067
I WANT SOME JEWS.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.600
OKAY, I'LL MAKE
A NOTE OF THAT.

14:08.633 --> 14:10.667
I WANT SOME COHENS,
SOME BERNSTEINS,

14:10.700 --> 14:14.067
SOME GOLDSTEINS,
A SCHWARTZ, OKAY ?

14:14.067 --> 14:15.967
ANYTHING IN THAT AREA,
THAT FAMILY, OKAY ?

14:16.067 --> 14:17.067
ALRIGHT.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.467
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY
WHO TOOK MY SEAT ?

14:18.500 --> 14:21.233
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT ?

14:21.267 --> 14:22.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING ?

14:22.533 --> 14:24.067
HE PUSHED ME AWAY
'CAUSE YOU SAID,

14:24.067 --> 14:25.067
"SIT ANYWHERE
YOU WANT".

14:25.067 --> 14:26.167
WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST SAY,

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
"EXCEPT THAT CHAIR,
THAT'S MY CHAIR" ?

14:28.233 --> 14:30.633
FIRST OF ALL, BECAUSE
HE'S FIXING JEFF'S CAR,

14:30.667 --> 14:32.400
I DIDN'T WANT TO
START UP WITH HIM.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.867
WELL, THAT'S NICE.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.100
I KNOW, AND THEN
HE SAID, GRACE ?

14:35.133 --> 14:36.100
COME ON.

14:36.133 --> 14:39.900
IT WAS CHARMING.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.933
HOW DO YOU DO
THAT, AGAIN ?

14:41.967 --> 14:43.400
THE FATHER, SON,
HOLY SPIRIT.

14:43.433 --> 14:44.567
AND WHAT ARE YOU
TOUCHING DOWN HERE ?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
YOUR BELLY BUTTON ?

14:45.633 --> 14:47.167
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
GO FARTHER DOWN,

14:47.200 --> 14:48.633
BUT, MOST PEOPLE JUST
GO TO THE CHEST.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.867
YOU GO TO
THE CHEST.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.567
FATHER, SON,
HOLY SPIRIT.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.567
AMEN.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.367
SO, YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE A GOOD TIME ?

14:56.400 --> 14:58.967
NO, I REALLY DIDN'T.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.167
AND GUESS WHAT ?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.233
WHAT ?

15:02.267 --> 15:04.400
SOMEBODY LOST
A LITTLE BET TONIGHT.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.067
SOMEBODY OWES
SOMEBODY...

15:06.100 --> 15:08.167
NO.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.067
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

15:10.067 --> 15:11.533
YOU BETTER START
THINKING ABOUT IT.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.833
HI.

15:15.867 --> 15:16.900
GOOD MORNING.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.600
I HAVE A SMALL
REQUEST.

15:18.633 --> 15:19.633
WHAT'S THAT ?

15:19.667 --> 15:21.667
CAN WE PLEASE
GO BACK TO COLGATE ?

15:21.700 --> 15:23.567
WHY ?

15:23.600 --> 15:25.300
I JUST DON'T LIKE,
THERE'S NO TASTE

15:25.333 --> 15:27.567
TO THAT INDIAN THING.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.367
THAT'S FINE.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.167
WHAT IS THERE,
A MESSAGE ON THIS THING ?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.633
REALLY ?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.867
I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR
THE PHONE RING.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.867
( answering machine )
Saturday, 7:32 am.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.333
Larry, uh,
Mike Duffy,

15:39.367 --> 15:40.500
AAMCO guy.

15:40.533 --> 15:41.733
Sorry for
calling so early.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.067
I'm feeling
a little weird

15:43.067 --> 15:44.800
about something
that happened last night.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.067
I wanna talk
to you about it.

15:46.067 --> 15:49.400
I'll be in my office,
say around, uh, 12:30.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.433
You got my number,
call me.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.767
I'd really
appreciate it, thanks.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.400
FEELING WEIRD
ABOUT SOMETHING ?

15:57.433 --> 15:58.900
YEAH, WHAT'S THAT ?

15:58.933 --> 16:00.633
WHAT KIND OF
MESSAGE IS THAT

16:00.667 --> 16:01.933
TO LEAVE AT 7:30
IN THE MORNING ?

16:01.967 --> 16:04.167
I DON'T KNOW,

16:04.200 --> 16:05.167
MAYBE HE'S VERY
UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
HE SHOULD HAVE
JUST SAID

16:06.233 --> 16:07.533
WHAT HE WAS
FEELING WEIRD ABOUT.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.533
NOW, I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THIS ALL DAY ?

16:09.567 --> 16:10.767
I HATE MESSAGES
LIKE THAT.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.067
EITHER JUST SAY,
"CALL ME BACK",

16:12.067 --> 16:14.233
OR TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE
FEELING WEIRD ABOUT.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.067
WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE
TO MAKE HIM FEEL WEIRD ?

16:16.067 --> 16:17.967
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING.

16:18.067 --> 16:23.367
UNLESS HE'S FEELING WEIRD
THAT HE TOOK MY SEAT.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.967
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.967
ALTHOUGH LAST NIGHT,
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO
MIND AT ALL.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.133
YEAH.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.100
OH, WAIT, OH,
WAIT A SECOND.

16:30.133 --> 16:31.600
YOU KNOW WHAT
IT COULD BE, TOO ?

16:31.633 --> 16:33.233
LAST NIGHT I WAS
TALKING TO ALLISON

16:33.267 --> 16:35.167
ABOUT OUR HOUSE
IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.433
AND I TOLD HER THAT
YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE

16:37.467 --> 16:38.867
TO STAY IN
THE GUEST HOUSE.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.267
AND, I LOOK OVER,
AND I SEE MAGGIE,

16:42.300 --> 16:44.533
LIKE SHE SEEMED LIKE
SHE OVERHEARD SOMETHING,

16:44.567 --> 16:46.633
AND SHE HAD A WEIRD
LOOK ON HER FACE.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.833
WELL, WHY WOULD
SHE CARE ?

16:47.867 --> 16:49.600
BECAUSE MAGGIE AND
MIKE ARE GOING TO

16:49.633 --> 16:51.467
MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.300
OH, I SEE.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.267
SO, NOW THEY THINK THAT
WE DON'T WANT THEM

16:55.300 --> 16:56.567
STAYING AT OUR
GUEST HOUSE.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.067
LIKE, INDIRECTLY,
I WAS TRYING TO

16:58.067 --> 16:59.233
GIVE HER
THE MESSAGE.

16:59.267 --> 17:01.900
WELL, WE DON'T WANT THEM
STAYING IN OUR GUEST HOUSE.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.600
BUT, NOW THEY THINK
I DON'T WANT THEM

17:03.633 --> 17:05.067
STAYING IN
THE GUEST HOUSE.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.733
IF IT'S BETWEEN HIM
FIXING JEFF'S CAR,

17:07.767 --> 17:09.400
OR HIM STAYING
IN OUR GUEST HOUSE,

17:09.433 --> 17:10.567
JEFF'S OUT OF LUCK.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.833
THAT'S FINE
WITH ME.

17:12.867 --> 17:14.533
I THINK I'M GONNA GET
ONE OF THOSE APPLE TURNOVERS

17:14.567 --> 17:15.833
FROM LAST NIGHT.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.433
( Cheryl )
OH, OKAY...

17:17.467 --> 17:20.167
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.133
WHERE ARE
THE APPLE TURNOVERS ?

17:23.167 --> 17:25.733
THEY'RE IN
THE REFRIGERATOR ?

17:25.767 --> 17:27.933
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.400
LARRY, YOU DON'T
SEE THEM IN THERE ?

17:31.433 --> 17:33.067
THEY'RE NOT
IN HERE.

17:33.067 --> 17:35.200
OKAY, I KNOW HOW
YOU LOOK FOR THINGS.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.267
YEAH, THEY'RE
NOT THERE.

17:37.300 --> 17:42.567
WHERE'S ALL THE FOOD
FROM LAST NIGHT ?

17:42.600 --> 17:43.767
WHERE ARE
THE LEFTOVERS ?

17:43.800 --> 17:44.933
I DON'T KNOW.

17:44.967 --> 17:47.567
DID YOU TELL
THE CATERER

17:47.600 --> 17:48.700
TO TAKE
THINGS HOME ?

17:48.733 --> 17:50.300
NO, NO.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.167
I DID NOT.
YOU DIDN'T.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT ?

17:54.233 --> 17:55.700
I DON'T KNOW.

17:55.733 --> 17:56.867
SHE TOOK
THE LEFTOVERS ?

17:56.900 --> 17:58.733
SHE WOULD
JUST TAKE 'EM ?

17:58.767 --> 18:00.800
DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE WOULD
TAKE IT UPON HERSELF TO--

18:00.833 --> 18:05.133
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.933
I SEEM TO
REMEMBER HER

18:07.967 --> 18:09.467
WALKING OUT
WITH A PLATTER,

18:09.500 --> 18:10.600
TO THE CAR.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.300
WELL, DID YOU
SAY SOMETHING ?

18:12.333 --> 18:14.167
YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HER ?

18:14.200 --> 18:16.433
I DON'T EXPECT HER
TO STEAL OUR FOOD.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.200
WELL, THIS
IS STEALING.

18:18.233 --> 18:19.233
I KNOW IT IS.

18:19.267 --> 18:20.467
I MEAN,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.667
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
ASK ANYBODY ?

18:21.700 --> 18:22.900
I'M CALLING...

18:22.933 --> 18:24.600
THIS IS,
YOU KNOW...

18:24.633 --> 18:27.400
THIS IS VERY
UNPROFESSIONAL,
IF YOU ASK ME.

18:27.433 --> 18:29.333
IT'S COMPLETELY
UNPROFESSIONAL.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.233
AND I KNOW, BECAUSE
MY WHOLE CAREER'S

18:31.267 --> 18:33.367
BEEN BASED ON
BEING UNPROFESSIONAL.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.100
YOU SHOULD NEVER LISTEN
TO JEFF FOR ANYTHING.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.800
I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE
TO KEEP TELLING YOU THAT.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.800
HI, MAY I
SPEAK TO...

18:39.833 --> 18:42.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WOMAN
STOLE OUR LEFTOVERS !

18:42.067 --> 18:44.600
HI, DEBBIE,
IT'S CHERYL DAVID
FROM LAST NIGHT.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.333
UM, LARRY AND I
WERE JUST WONDERING,

18:46.367 --> 18:48.667
WHERE THE
LEFTOVER FOOD IS.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.733
YOU DID ?

18:51.767 --> 18:53.800
WELL, WHY
DID YOU THINK

18:53.833 --> 18:56.200
YOU COULD TAKE THE FOOD
HOME WITH YOU ?

18:56.233 --> 18:58.867
DID ANYBODY TELL YOU
YOU COULD DO THAT ?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.567
OH, NOBODY TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T, GREAT.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.100
WELL, WE WILL
CANCEL THE CHECK

19:03.133 --> 19:04.600
IF WE DON'T GET
THE FOOD BACK.

19:04.633 --> 19:08.100
YEAH, SO, SO...

19:08.133 --> 19:10.967
LARRY'S GONNA COME OVER
AND PICK IT UP.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.433
HE'LL BE OVER
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.867
THANKS.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.833
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:16.867 --> 19:18.467
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.833
WHAT NERVE.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.467
SO, I GOTTA GO OVER THERE
AND PICK UP THE LEFTOVERS ?

19:21.500 --> 19:22.967
YEAH.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.700
I'M REALLY NOT SURE
THAT EVERYTHING

19:29.733 --> 19:31.867
SURVIVED THE TRIP
HERE, SO...

19:31.900 --> 19:34.067
"SURVIVED
THE TRIP HERE" ?

19:34.067 --> 19:35.733
WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM,
THE SUDAN ?

19:35.767 --> 19:37.367
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.067
WHERE'S
THE CHICKEN ?

19:39.067 --> 19:42.100
THERE REALLY ISN'T
ANY CHICKEN LEFT.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.200
THERE'S NO
CHICKEN LEFT ?

19:43.233 --> 19:44.567
NOT REALLY.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE CHICKEN.

19:47.367 --> 19:48.567
WHAT'D YOU
DO WITH IT ?

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
YOU THREW IT OUT ?

19:49.633 --> 19:51.600
THERE WAS,
MAYBE,

19:51.633 --> 19:53.400
THERE WAS THREE
PIECES OF CHICKEN.

19:53.433 --> 19:54.767
THREE PIECES
OF CHICKEN ?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.067
YES.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.433
OH, WHERE'D THAT
COME FROM ?

19:57.467 --> 19:59.267
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
THERE YOU GO.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.433
WHERE'S THE
REST OF IT ?

20:00.467 --> 20:05.000
THAT, I GAVE IT AWAY
TO A HOMELESS SHELTER.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.467
YOU GAVE IT TO
A HOMELESS SHELTER.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.600
YES, I DID,
YES, I DID.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.400
AND WHERE IS THIS
HOMELESS SHELTER ?

20:10.433 --> 20:12.933
THE SCOTT MISSION
ON FOURTH.

20:12.967 --> 20:15.867
SO, THEY EAT THIS
GOURMET FOOD, HUH ?

20:15.900 --> 20:17.033
CATERED FOOD ?

20:17.067 --> 20:18.400
UH, SORRY
TO INTERRUPT.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.067
BUT I DROPPED
THE FOOD OFF AT JEFF'S.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.400
THANK YOU,
CARMEL.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.367
DID YOU WANNA MAYBE CHECK
ON THE BUNS OUT BACK ?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.533
JEFF GREENE'S ?

20:25.567 --> 20:26.900
YOU DROPPED THE FOOD
OFF AT JEFF GREENE'S ?

20:26.933 --> 20:28.133
THANK'S,
CARMEL.

20:28.167 --> 20:29.633
DOES HE HAVE
THE APPLE TURNOVERS,

20:29.667 --> 20:30.867
OR DO YOU HAVE THE?

20:30.900 --> 20:34.033
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE APPLE TURNOVERS.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.133
OH, YOU DON'T ?

20:35.167 --> 20:37.167
THAT'S A MYSTERY TO YOU,
THE APPLE TURNOVERS ?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

20:38.567 --> 20:40.667
I THINK MAYBE PEOPLE FINISHED
THEM OFF LAST NIGHT.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.333
THAT'S YOUR THEORY FOR
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING,

20:42.367 --> 20:43.567
ISN'T IT ?

20:43.600 --> 20:46.267
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BUY YOURSELF
10 APPLE TURNOVERS ?

20:46.300 --> 20:47.367
I DID,
I DID BUY THEM !

20:47.400 --> 20:48.633
I'LL SPRING
FOR THEM.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.800
I BOUGHT 'EM LAST NIGHT
AND SOMEBODY TOOK 'EM !

21:00.800 --> 21:02.100
ENJOYING
THE CHICKEN ?

21:02.133 --> 21:05.067
HEY, HEY !

21:05.067 --> 21:07.467
HEY...

21:07.500 --> 21:09.333
I WAS GONNA BRING THIS
OVER BY YOUR HOUSE LATER.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.433
WHAT WERE YOU
GONNA DO ?

21:10.467 --> 21:11.533
BRING IT BY
YOUR HOUSE.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.200
I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
MIND ME HAVING SOME.

21:13.233 --> 21:14.700
OH, YEAH ?

21:14.733 --> 21:16.167
DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE
STOLE MY LEFTOVERS ?

21:16.200 --> 21:17.267
YES, I DID.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.733
YOU DID ?
YOU KNEW THAT ?

21:18.767 --> 21:19.867
I JUST FOUND
THAT OUT.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.367
I SEE YOU GOT
MY APPLE TURNOVERS.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
THEY'RE DELICIOUS,
BY THE WAY.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.400
YEAH, I WANTED TO
HAVE ONE THIS MORNING,

21:24.433 --> 21:26.367
UNFORTUNATELY THEY
WEREN'T IN MY HOUSE.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.200
MAN, OH, MAN.

21:28.233 --> 21:32.733
DON'T SUGGEST ANY MORE
PEOPLE FOR ME, OKAY ?

21:32.767 --> 21:34.067
SHE'S A GOOD COOK.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.500
YEAH, SHE IS
A GOOD COOK.

21:35.533 --> 21:37.733
MMM, APPLE
TURNOVERS.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.167
WHAT A RACKET
YOU'VE GOT GOING.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.733
WHAT DO YOU GET ?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.833
10 PERCENT OF MY SALARY,
10 PERCENT OF MY FOOD ?

21:42.867 --> 21:44.300
STOP IT, STOP IT.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.200
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

21:47.233 --> 21:50.533
AAMCO GUY ?
WHAT ARE THE ODDS ?

21:50.567 --> 21:52.900
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
OF AN AAMCO GUY ?

21:52.933 --> 21:54.833
OH, THERE MIGHT BE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.500
WHAT'D YOU DO ?

21:56.533 --> 21:57.633
WELL, AT THE PARTY
LAST NIGHT,

21:57.667 --> 21:59.467
MY WIFE TOLD SOMEBODY

21:59.500 --> 22:02.067
THAT I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY
STAYING AT OUR HOUSE...

22:04.667 --> 22:06.867
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.433
WELL, MEANWHILE,

22:08.467 --> 22:09.733
HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.533
SO, AT LEAST
HE'S WORKING ON IT.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.467
YEAH, I KNOW,
THAT'S SO COOL.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.700
SO, LARRY, I GOT
SOME GOOD NEWS

22:14.733 --> 22:15.800
AND SOME BAD
NEWS FOR YOU.

22:15.833 --> 22:16.867
UH, THE BAD NEWS IS

22:16.900 --> 22:19.100
YOU DID SOME DAMAGE
TO THE TRANSMISSION.

22:19.133 --> 22:21.667
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
MY RASH CLEARED UP.

22:21.700 --> 22:25.133
NAW, SERIOUSLY,
I CAN FIX IT.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.333
YOU SEE, I'M ONE
OF THE FEW GUYS IN TOWN

22:27.367 --> 22:28.467
THAT CAN DO THIS,
YOU KNOW.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.067
GOOD MAN,
GOOD MAN.

22:30.067 --> 22:31.600
I SPECIALIZE IN
THE EARLY MODEL

22:31.633 --> 22:33.300
POWER GLIDE
TRANSMISSIONS,
YOU KNOW.

22:33.333 --> 22:34.300
REALLY ?
THAT'S GREAT.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.633
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE BEST DEAL I CAN.

22:35.667 --> 22:38.267
YOU TAKE CARE OF THE PARTS,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE LABOR.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.800
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE LABOR.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.467
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.067
I'M GONNA PAY
FOR THE LABOR.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.467
WELL LISTEN, UH,

22:46.500 --> 22:49.233
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
JUST FOR A SECOND
IN THE BACK ROOM ?

22:49.267 --> 22:51.200
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
KIND OF A PERSONAL NATURE.

22:51.233 --> 22:53.467
IF YOU DON'T
MIND, HUH ?

22:54.833 --> 22:56.200
APOLOGIZE IF
YOU HAVE TO.

22:56.233 --> 22:58.767
APOLOGIZE !

22:58.800 --> 23:00.233
( Mike )
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT ?

23:00.267 --> 23:01.333
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE MESS,

23:01.367 --> 23:02.433
IT'S KIND OF OUR
BUSY SEASON HERE.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.067
COME ON, YOU SHOULD
SEE MY OFFICE.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.633
I WANNA THANK YOU

23:05.667 --> 23:07.333
FOR THAT WONDERFUL DINNER
YOU GAVE US LAST NIGHT.

23:07.367 --> 23:08.867
MIKE, IT WAS
MY PLEASURE.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.067
IT WAS A
GREAT TIME.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.167
WASN'T IT GREAT ?

23:11.200 --> 23:12.767
THE FOOD WAS
TERRIFIC.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.067
AND, YOUR FRIENDS,

23:14.100 --> 23:16.067
I REALLY ENJOYED
THEIR COMPANY.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.333
I'M SORRY
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

23:17.367 --> 23:18.433
TO PLAY THAT
RUNNING CHARADES.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.533
OH, THAT'S OKAY,
NEXT TIME WE'LL DO THAT.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.867
I HOPE SO.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.833
LISTEN, THE REASON
I'M FEELING BAD IS THAT,

23:23.867 --> 23:25.500
ON THE WAY HOME MAGGIE
MENTIONED SOMETHING TO ME.

23:25.533 --> 23:26.667
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

23:26.700 --> 23:29.333
MY WIFE NEVER
SHOULD HAVE SAID

23:29.367 --> 23:31.567
THAT I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
TO STAY IN THE HOUSE

23:31.600 --> 23:33.100
IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD
THIS SUMMER.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.400
ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA
APOLOGIZE TO YOU

23:34.433 --> 23:36.067
FOR SITTING
IN YOUR CHAIR.

23:36.067 --> 23:38.800
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.367
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE SAT
AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.967
I DON'T CARE THAT
YOU SAT THERE.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.900
NO, IT'S YOUR HOUSE,
IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

23:44.933 --> 23:48.800
I LIKE SITTING
OVER THERE.

23:48.833 --> 23:49.900
BUT, MARTHA'S
VINEYARD, I MEAN...

23:49.933 --> 23:51.733
DO YOU THINK
I CARE ABOUT THAT ?

23:51.767 --> 23:54.067
LET'S GET BACK TO
MARTHA'S VINEYARD
FOR A SECOND,

23:54.067 --> 23:55.533
MAGGIE AND I ARE
GONNA GO THERE,

23:55.567 --> 23:57.600
BUT, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE'RE GONNA BARGE IN

23:57.633 --> 23:59.700
AND INVADE
YOUR PRIVACY.

23:59.733 --> 24:01.900
WE'VE BEEN GOING TO
MARTHA'S VINEYARD FOR YEARS,

24:01.933 --> 24:03.967
I'VE BEEN GOING THERE
SINCE I WAS A KID.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.067
WE'LL GO THIS SUMMER,
WE'LL GO CLAMMING TOGETHER.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.300
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
DOING ANY CLAMMING

24:07.333 --> 24:08.433
IN MARTHA'S
VINEYARD, LARRY.

24:08.467 --> 24:09.533
I HAVE FRIENDS THERE,

24:09.567 --> 24:11.533
WE DON'TAVE TO
IMPOSE UPON YOU.

24:11.567 --> 24:12.867
I DIDN'T SUGGEST
THAT YOU WOULD.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.367
I THINK YOU DID
SUGGEST IT, LARRY.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.067
YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING
THIS WHOLE THING.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.667
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
IT'S OUR BUSY SEASON,

24:20.700 --> 24:22.233
AND I GOT SOME THINGS
I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF.

24:22.267 --> 24:23.800
IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

24:23.833 --> 24:24.867
I HAVE TO MAKE
A PHONE CALL.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.133
MIKE, CAN I JUST--

24:26.167 --> 24:28.133
LARRY, I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE.

24:31.167 --> 24:34.167
( gears grinding )

24:44.167 --> 24:46.467
YOU GOT ANY
SPARE CHANGE, MAN ?

24:46.500 --> 24:49.067
HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

24:49.067 --> 24:50.900
EVER EAT OVER AT THAT
MISSION ON FOURTH STREET ?

24:50.933 --> 24:52.233
YEAH.

24:52.267 --> 24:56.067
DO THEY EVER SERVE ANYTHING
LIKE CHICKEN L'ORANGE ?

24:56.100 --> 24:58.100
THE ONLY THING
THEY SERVE IS SOUP

24:58.133 --> 25:00.167
AND SOMETIMES
PEANUT BUTTER.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.800
SOUP AND
PEANUT BUTTER.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.767
YOU WANT THIS ?

25:04.800 --> 25:06.867
WHAT IS IT ?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.800
CHICKEN L'ORANGE.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.067
SEAFOOD SALAD
SOUFFLE.

25:11.067 --> 25:12.867
SURE, I'LL TAKE IT.

25:12.900 --> 25:13.967
YOU GOT IT.

25:14.067 --> 25:15.067
THANK YOU.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.833
ENJOY.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.067
THAT RESTAURANT
WAS GOOD.

25:23.067 --> 25:24.100
OH, WASN'T THAT
A GREAT MEAL ?

25:24.133 --> 25:25.500
YEAH, I LOVED IT.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.367
NOTHING LIKE
A GOOD PIECE OF FISH.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.133
YEAH, THEY HAVE
GOOD SEAFOOD.

25:32.067 --> 25:35.367
WELL, SOMEBODY
