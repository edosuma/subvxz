PICARD:<i> Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.667 --> 00:05.792
<i>Stardate 41263.1:</i>

00:05.792 --> 00:08.875
<i>We have rendezvoused</i>

00:05.792 --> 00:08.875
<i>with the</i> USS Fearless

00:08.875 --> 00:11.000
<i>from which a Starfleet</i>

00:08.875 --> 00:11.000
<i>propulsion expert</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:12.375
<i>and his assistant</i>

00:12.375 --> 00:14.583
<i>are beaming over</i>

00:12.375 --> 00:14.583
<i>to conduct tests</i>

00:14.583 --> 00:16.959
<i>on the</i> Enterprise's

00:14.583 --> 00:16.959
<i>warp drive engines.</i>

00:16.959 --> 00:19.250
<i>They have completed</i>

00:16.959 --> 00:19.250
<i>similar adjustments</i>

00:19.250 --> 00:22.083
<i>on two other Starfleet vessels.</i>

00:22.083 --> 00:24.125
I don't understand

00:22.083 --> 00:24.125
your concern, Number One.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.333
They're not authorized

00:25.333 --> 00:27.250
to make any alterations

00:25.333 --> 00:27.250
in our engines.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.750
According to

00:27.250 --> 00:28.750
Starfleet's report

00:28.750 --> 00:30.000
they will simply

00:28.750 --> 00:30.000
run tests

00:30.000 --> 00:31.875
on different ways of

00:30.000 --> 00:31.875
entering warp speed

00:31.875 --> 00:33.208
and different

00:31.875 --> 00:33.208
intermix formulas.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.709
Where's the

00:33.208 --> 00:34.709
harm in that?

00:34.709 --> 00:36.709
It's the specs

00:34.709 --> 00:36.709
Kosinski sent us.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.709
In my opinion, sir,

00:36.709 --> 00:38.709
they're gibberish.

00:38.709 --> 00:39.834
Gibberish?

00:39.834 --> 00:42.250
Mr. Data,

00:39.834 --> 00:42.250
would you explain?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.875
Sir, we put Mr. Kosinski's

00:42.250 --> 00:44.875
specs into the computer

00:44.875 --> 00:46.500
and ran a controlled test

00:44.875 --> 00:46.500
on them.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.709
There was no improvement

00:46.500 --> 00:48.709
in engine performance.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.959
Then how do you explain

00:48.709 --> 00:50.959
Starfleet's report

00:50.959 --> 00:52.875
that the same tests

00:50.959 --> 00:52.875
on the USS<i> Ajax</i>

00:52.875 --> 00:54.542
and the<i> Fearless</i> over there

00:54.542 --> 00:56.709
resulted in a measurable

00:54.542 --> 00:56.709
increase in propulsion?

00:56.709 --> 00:59.875
RIKER:

00:56.709 --> 00:59.875
Our engines are new,

00:56.709 --> 00:59.875
sir, top condition.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.667
The tests on those older ships

00:59.875 --> 01:01.667
may have simply been

01:01.667 --> 01:03.667
to straighten out some

01:01.667 --> 01:03.667
engine inefficiency.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.333
MAN:

01:03.667 --> 01:05.333
<i>Bridge from transporter chief.</i>

01:05.333 --> 01:08.000
<i>Two from USS</i> Fearless

01:05.333 --> 01:08.000
<i>are ready to beam over.</i>

01:09.750 --> 01:10.792
Stand by for

01:09.750 --> 01:10.792
Mr. Riker, Chief.

01:10.792 --> 01:11.959
He's on his way.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.542
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

01:13.542 --> 01:15.583
Since you're concerned

01:13.542 --> 01:15.583
about these tests.

01:15.583 --> 01:17.083
Yes, sir.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.375
Captain,

01:18.333 --> 01:21.375
if I may

01:21.375 --> 01:23.542
I'll ask Counselor Troi

01:21.375 --> 01:23.542
to look these visitors over.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.083
Very good.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.417
Welcome aboard,

01:48.291 --> 01:50.417
Mr. Kosinski.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.375
I'm the first officer,

01:50.417 --> 01:52.375
Commander William Riker

01:52.375 --> 01:53.333
and this is...

01:53.333 --> 01:55.083
Where is the

01:53.333 --> 01:55.083
Captain, please?

01:55.083 --> 01:57.500
He's engaged in

01:55.083 --> 01:57.500
other duties, sir.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
A ship's engines

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
should be the concern

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
of a ship's Captain.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.458
RIKER:

02:00.041 --> 02:01.458
They are, sir

02:01.458 --> 02:03.375
which is why they have

02:01.458 --> 02:03.375
made the first officer

02:03.375 --> 02:04.709
directly responsible

02:04.709 --> 02:06.959
for an engine's

02:04.709 --> 02:06.959
conditions and

02:04.709 --> 02:06.959
performance--

02:06.959 --> 02:08.959
guided, of course,

02:06.959 --> 02:08.959
by one of our

02:06.959 --> 02:08.959
chief engineers

02:08.959 --> 02:11.500
Lieutenant Commander Argyle,

02:08.959 --> 02:11.500
in this case.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.917
A pleasure

02:11.500 --> 02:12.917
to meet you, sir.

02:12.917 --> 02:15.000
I appreciated

02:12.917 --> 02:15.000
receiving the specs.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.208
To which you have

02:15.000 --> 02:17.208
no end of questions.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.917
Aye, I have.

02:18.917 --> 02:20.875
And you, sir,

02:18.917 --> 02:20.875
are listed as...?

02:20.875 --> 02:23.333
As Mr. Kosinski's

02:20.875 --> 02:23.333
assistant.

02:23.333 --> 02:26.917
My actual name is

02:23.333 --> 02:26.917
unpronounceable by humans.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.959
You're from Tau Alpha C.

02:28.959 --> 02:30.041
That's very distant.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.875
All approved

02:30.041 --> 02:31.875
and described

02:31.875 --> 02:33.917
in the Starfleet

02:31.875 --> 02:33.917
communications.

02:33.917 --> 02:37.208
Now, I would like to

02:33.917 --> 02:37.208
set up in the engine

02:33.917 --> 02:37.208
room immediately.

02:37.208 --> 02:40.208
I'll have our chief

02:37.208 --> 02:40.208
engineer show you

02:37.208 --> 02:40.208
to his engine room.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.750
No need.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.291
I know my way

02:41.750 --> 02:44.291
around starships.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.125
One thing that Kosinski isn't

02:47.250 --> 02:50.125
hiding is bad disposition.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.500
Agreed.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.750
Also he's arrogant,

02:51.500 --> 02:54.750
overbearing, self-important

02:54.750 --> 02:57.917
and very sure of himself

02:54.750 --> 02:57.917
and his ability.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.041
And the other one?

02:57.917 --> 03:00.041
His assistant?

03:00.041 --> 03:01.542
He's the puzzle.

03:01.542 --> 03:03.375
With most life-forms,

03:03.375 --> 03:05.208
I can usually

03:03.375 --> 03:05.208
feel something.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.917
I may not be able

03:05.208 --> 03:07.917
to understand or

03:05.208 --> 03:07.917
interpret it

03:07.917 --> 03:11.750
but I feel something,

03:07.917 --> 03:11.750
if only a presence.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.375
With him, nothing.

03:14.375 --> 03:15.750
Empty space.

03:15.750 --> 03:18.750
It's as though

03:15.750 --> 03:18.750
he isn't even here.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.083
Something about

03:18.750 --> 03:21.083
this concerns me.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.625
I don't know what.

03:22.625 --> 03:25.709
I can point to

03:22.625 --> 03:25.709
no reason... yet.

03:25.709 --> 03:28.500
Stay concerned, please.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.917
The safety

03:28.500 --> 03:29.917

03:29.917 --> 03:32.291

♪♪

05:34.083 --> 05:35.500
Inform the Bridge

05:35.500 --> 05:37.250
I shall begin

05:35.500 --> 05:37.250
my first test

05:37.250 --> 05:38.959
in precisely

05:37.250 --> 05:38.959
15 minutes.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.166
Why is this

05:38.959 --> 05:40.166
child here?

05:40.166 --> 05:41.792
He's working on

05:40.166 --> 05:41.792
a school project.

05:41.792 --> 05:42.959
And before you begin

05:42.959 --> 05:44.083
there are

05:42.959 --> 05:44.083
some questions.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.625
First, tell us

05:44.083 --> 05:45.625
how you arrived...

05:45.625 --> 05:47.458
In order to

05:45.625 --> 05:47.458
save myself time

05:47.458 --> 05:50.250
let me ask those

05:47.458 --> 05:50.250
questions for you.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.750
You received the information

05:50.250 --> 05:52.750
which Starfleet provided

05:52.750 --> 05:54.709
you fed it

05:52.750 --> 05:54.709
into your computer

05:54.709 --> 05:56.542
as precisely as

05:54.709 --> 05:56.542
humanly possible

05:56.542 --> 05:58.166
then you did

05:56.542 --> 05:58.166
a controlled test

05:58.166 --> 06:01.959
and then, to your astonishment,

05:58.166 --> 06:01.959
nothing happened.

06:01.959 --> 06:05.041
So you said, "What's going on?

06:05.041 --> 06:06.291
"This doesn't work.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.750
Kosinski's a fraud."

06:08.750 --> 06:10.166
You see, I have had

06:08.750 --> 06:10.166
this conversation

06:10.166 --> 06:12.333
on other Starfleet

06:10.166 --> 06:12.333
vessels before.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.959
They didn't understand

06:12.333 --> 06:14.959
it, why should you?

06:14.959 --> 06:17.125
Surely you're not saying

06:14.959 --> 06:17.125
it's unexplainable.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.917
I'm saying I'm

06:17.125 --> 06:18.917
not a teacher

06:18.917 --> 06:21.250
nor do I wish

06:18.917 --> 06:21.250
to become one.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.041
I have neither the

06:21.250 --> 06:24.041
inclination nor the time.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.250
You have all the time

06:25.667 --> 06:28.250
you need.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.125
I don't think

06:28.250 --> 06:30.125
you understand.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.667
This has already been approved

06:30.125 --> 06:32.667
by Starfleet Command.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.834
But it hasn't

06:32.667 --> 06:33.834
been approved

06:33.834 --> 06:35.750
by the chief engineer

06:33.834 --> 06:35.750
or by me.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.083
(<i> scoffs</i> )

06:37.083 --> 06:38.583
I didn't know

06:37.083 --> 06:38.583
that was necessary.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.250
Now you do.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.625
Perhaps I should speak

06:41.959 --> 06:44.625
to Captain Picard.

06:44.625 --> 06:45.917
If you like.

06:45.917 --> 06:47.250
It won't change

06:45.917 --> 06:47.250
anything.

06:49.667 --> 06:50.959
How basic shall I be?

06:50.959 --> 06:53.667
I'll leave that to you.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.750
Would you get

06:57.917 --> 07:00.750
on the auxiliary

06:57.917 --> 07:00.750
panel, please?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.291
In order

07:00.750 --> 07:02.291
to save time

07:02.291 --> 07:04.875
my assistant is

07:02.291 --> 07:04.875
going to lay in

07:02.291 --> 07:04.875
my base formulas

07:04.875 --> 07:07.208
more rapidly than

07:04.875 --> 07:07.208
any human being

07:04.875 --> 07:07.208
possibly could--

07:07.208 --> 07:08.250
even myself.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.125
So, here, then

07:10.125 --> 07:12.417
in the simplest possible terms,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.417
is what I do.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.291
Now, this warp drive system

07:12.417 --> 07:15.291
has been tuned

07:15.291 --> 07:17.375
only in

07:15.291 --> 07:17.375
the grossest possible sense

07:17.375 --> 07:19.458
at least according

07:17.375 --> 07:19.458
to my standards.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.041
What I do is specific.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.041
Thank you.

for now, that these symbols...

07:27.542 --> 07:31.500
Something troubles you

07:27.542 --> 07:31.500
in the way this is configured?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.125
How about it now?

07:42.166 --> 07:45.083
Yes.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.166
But shouldn't

07:45.083 --> 07:48.166
these be connected...

07:48.166 --> 07:50.333
here...

07:50.333 --> 07:53.125
and here?

07:59.792 --> 08:03.583
Now will it do what

07:59.792 --> 08:03.583
Kosinski says it will?

08:03.583 --> 08:04.875
It has a chance.

08:06.917 --> 08:10.667
It might work

08:06.917 --> 08:10.667
better this way.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.083
Yes.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.667
KOSINSKI:

08:15.083 --> 08:17.667
...as nature itself.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.041
View with me,

08:17.667 --> 08:19.041
if you will this screen

08:19.041 --> 08:20.250
as we consider the following.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.458
Now, is this merely

08:20.250 --> 08:22.458
mechanics

08:22.458 --> 08:25.792
or is it nature

08:22.458 --> 08:25.792
that we deal with

08:22.458 --> 08:25.792
in all of this?

08:25.792 --> 08:27.417
And what else than nature

08:27.417 --> 08:30.333
are the elementals

08:27.417 --> 08:30.333
of space and time?

08:30.333 --> 08:31.542
You are trained in the system.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.583
You are... you go

08:31.542 --> 08:33.583
in a straight line--

08:33.583 --> 08:35.667
competent, yes,

08:33.583 --> 08:35.667
perhaps even innovative

08:35.667 --> 08:37.959
in a minimalist

08:35.667 --> 08:37.959
sort of way--

08:37.959 --> 08:41.500
but what I do here

08:37.959 --> 08:41.500
is not the end of the process.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.333
It is the beginning.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.041
So what do I do?

08:45.041 --> 08:46.166
Go back to the<i> Fearless</i>

08:46.166 --> 08:47.667
which I left

08:46.166 --> 08:47.667
with a more efficient

08:47.667 --> 08:49.834
warp drive system

08:47.667 --> 08:49.834
than I found?

08:49.834 --> 08:51.500
Or do you cast off

08:49.834 --> 08:51.500
your ignorance

08:51.500 --> 08:53.291
and allow me to continue?

08:54.583 --> 08:57.250
Can anything

08:54.583 --> 08:57.250
he's proposing

08:54.583 --> 08:57.250
damage our system?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.625
How could it?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.625
It's meaningless.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.291
Then we should

08:58.625 --> 09:00.291
let him try it?

09:00.291 --> 09:02.041
What do you mean,

09:00.291 --> 09:02.041
"Let him try it"?!

09:02.041 --> 09:03.500
Don't talk about me

09:02.041 --> 09:03.500
in the third person

09:03.500 --> 09:05.208
as if I'm not standing

09:03.500 --> 09:05.208
right here.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.083
Yes, we might as well

09:05.208 --> 09:07.083
let him try it.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.375
Oh, yes, "We might

09:07.083 --> 09:08.375
as well let him try it."

09:08.375 --> 09:09.500
You are too generous.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.000
Boy! Boy!

09:09.500 --> 09:13.000
Don't play with that.

09:22.417 --> 09:25.417
Captain, main Engineering

09:22.417 --> 09:25.417
is ready to proceed.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.917
Engineering,

09:25.417 --> 09:27.917
this is the Bridge.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.583
It's your call.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.083
Do this one just like last time.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.834
Nothing changes.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.083
Commander,

09:32.834 --> 09:34.083
I'll make

09:34.083 --> 09:37.542
my preliminary

09:34.083 --> 09:37.542
adjustments

09:34.083 --> 09:37.542
at warp 1.5

09:37.542 --> 09:39.083
and complete them

09:37.542 --> 09:39.083
as we achieve

09:39.083 --> 09:41.000
warp four.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.542
Engineering to Bridge.

09:42.542 --> 09:43.875
Did you copy that?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.166
Affirmative, Number One.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.959
You ready?

09:47.959 --> 09:49.667
We are.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.000
PICARD:

09:49.667 --> 09:52.000
<i>La Forge, set in warp 1.5.</i>

09:52.000 --> 09:55.667
Warp 1.5, Sir.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.208
Engage.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.333
All right.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.542
Here we go.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.834
What are you doing?

10:35.834 --> 10:38.375
(<i> alarms ringing</i> )

11:00.291 --> 11:02.291
(<i> alarms continue</i> )

11:09.208 --> 11:10.875
Captain,

11:09.208 --> 11:10.875
we're passing warp ten.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.375
(<i> rumbling</i> )

11:31.542 --> 11:33.083
What is our velocity?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.917
It's off the scale, sir.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.583
Reverse engines.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.542
Captain, no one

11:40.542 --> 11:42.500
has ever reversed engines

11:40.542 --> 11:42.500
at this velocity.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.792
That's because no one

11:42.500 --> 11:44.792
has gone this fast.

11:44.792 --> 11:45.834
Reverse engines.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.083
All stop.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.041
Reading all stop, sir.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.750
Position?

12:05.750 --> 12:07.500
Calculating it, sir.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.750
Data, what do you read

12:07.500 --> 12:10.750
over there?

12:10.750 --> 12:13.917
A malfunction, I trust.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.375
Position, Mr. La Forge.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.959
Well, sir, according

12:15.375 --> 12:17.959
to these calculations

12:17.959 --> 12:19.667
we've not only left

12:17.959 --> 12:19.667
our own galaxy

12:19.667 --> 12:21.166
but passed through two others

12:21.166 --> 12:23.875
ending up on the far

12:21.166 --> 12:23.875
side of Triangulum--

12:23.875 --> 12:26.750
the galaxy known as M-33.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.375
That's not possible.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.834
Data, what distance

12:30.083 --> 12:31.834
have we traveled?

12:31.834 --> 12:35.667
Two million, 700,000

12:31.834 --> 12:35.667
light-years, sir.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.959
I can't accept that.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.417
You must, sir.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.333
Our comparisons show it

12:39.417 --> 12:42.333
to be completely accurate.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.375
LA FORGE:

12:42.333 --> 12:45.375
And I calculate that

12:42.333 --> 12:45.375
at maximum warp, sir

12:45.375 --> 12:48.333
it would take over...

12:48.333 --> 12:51.000
300 years

12:51.000 --> 12:52.542
to get home.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.792
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

13:01.208 --> 13:04.792

13:29.709 --> 13:31.542
they should receive

13:31.542 --> 13:33.542
ten months

13:33.542 --> 13:34.917
nine weeks,

13:33.542 --> 13:34.917
16 days...

13:34.917 --> 13:36.083
Mister Data!

13:36.083 --> 13:37.458
Sir?

13:42.875 --> 13:44.959
Captain Picard, I presume.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.625
We're still trying to determine

13:44.959 --> 13:46.625
what happened.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.208
The truth is, Captain,

13:46.625 --> 13:48.208
I made a mistake--

13:48.208 --> 13:50.041
a wonderful,

13:48.208 --> 13:50.041
incredible mistake.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.667
Just explain

13:50.041 --> 13:52.667
what brought us here.

13:52.667 --> 13:54.250
As the power grew,

13:54.250 --> 13:56.917
I applied

13:54.250 --> 13:56.917
the energy asymptotically.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.709
I anticipated some tilling,

13:56.917 --> 13:58.709
but it didn't occur.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.208
Now, that was

13:58.709 --> 14:00.208
my error--

14:00.208 --> 14:03.125
using the Bessel functions at

14:00.208 --> 14:03.125
the beginning.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.750
What is he saying,

14:03.125 --> 14:04.750
Number One?

14:04.750 --> 14:07.500
To tell the truth, sir,

14:04.750 --> 14:07.500
it sounds like nonsense to me

14:07.500 --> 14:09.875
but... considering...

14:09.875 --> 14:11.125
Considering...

14:11.125 --> 14:13.875
where we are...

14:13.875 --> 14:15.875
we must assume it isn't.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.333
WESLEY:

14:17.667 --> 14:19.333
Can I do something to help?

14:21.834 --> 14:23.500
I can call my mother.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.542
She's a doctor.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.500
No, there's nothing

14:24.542 --> 14:26.500
she can do.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.834
I need to rest.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.667
I've been away

14:27.834 --> 14:29.667
too long.

14:29.667 --> 14:31.417
What happened to you?

14:31.417 --> 14:34.875
Is it part of

14:31.417 --> 14:34.875
what happened

14:31.417 --> 14:34.875
to the ship?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.000
Please believe me.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I mean no harm

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
to this vessel

14:38.000 --> 14:39.291
or those in it.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.667
Is Mr. Kosinski

14:42.125 --> 14:44.667
like he sounds?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.083
A joke?

14:46.083 --> 14:48.458
No, that's too cruel.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.834
He has sensed some

14:48.458 --> 14:51.834
small part of it.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.417
That space and time

14:54.083 --> 14:57.417
and thought

14:57.417 --> 15:00.709
aren't the separate things

14:57.417 --> 15:00.709
they appear to be?

15:03.333 --> 15:05.417
I just thought

15:03.333 --> 15:05.417
the formula you were using

15:05.417 --> 15:06.667
said something

15:05.417 --> 15:06.667
like that.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.834
Boy, don't ever

15:06.667 --> 15:08.834
say that again

15:08.834 --> 15:10.083
especially not

15:08.834 --> 15:10.083
at your age

15:10.083 --> 15:14.041
in a world that's

15:10.083 --> 15:14.041
not ready for such...

15:14.041 --> 15:17.041
such dangerous

15:14.041 --> 15:17.041
nonsense.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.458
I've always suspected

15:18.458 --> 15:20.834
that this rate of speed

15:18.458 --> 15:20.834
was possible, of course

15:20.834 --> 15:23.625
but at this level--

15:20.834 --> 15:23.625
no, never.

15:25.041 --> 15:28.375
We're going to need new

15:25.041 --> 15:28.375
definitions, new parameters.

15:28.375 --> 15:32.083
You could call it

15:28.375 --> 15:32.083
the Kosinski Scale.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.542
Why not?

15:33.542 --> 15:36.583
Yes, of course,

15:33.542 --> 15:36.583
since I'm the

15:33.542 --> 15:36.583
one who has made

15:36.583 --> 15:39.917
the so-called warp

15:36.583 --> 15:39.917
barrier meaningless.

15:39.917 --> 15:43.458
And Captain, this must be

15:39.917 --> 15:43.458
a special thrill for you.

15:43.458 --> 15:44.500
Thrill?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.208
Mm-hmm, as an explorer.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.458
In three centuries

15:46.208 --> 15:48.458
of space travel

15:48.458 --> 15:50.875
we've charted just

15:48.458 --> 15:50.875
11 percent of our galaxy.

15:50.875 --> 15:54.458
And then...

15:50.875 --> 15:54.458
we accomplish this.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.667
Yes, but isn't the real point

15:57.667 --> 15:59.750
can you do it again?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.750
Can you get us home?

16:01.750 --> 16:05.083
Well, of course, I can.

16:05.083 --> 16:08.083
I'll just do what I did before.

16:11.417 --> 16:12.875
Coming, Riker?

16:12.875 --> 16:15.333
<i>Commander</i> Riker will

16:12.875 --> 16:15.333
join you soon in a moment.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.458
Comment is invited.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.917
Counselor?

16:27.917 --> 16:30.458
He's convinced he's right.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.917
I've no doubt of that.

16:32.917 --> 16:36.125
Captain, can you allow

16:32.917 --> 16:36.125
a man who's made one mistake

16:36.125 --> 16:38.583
back into a position

16:36.125 --> 16:38.583
where he may make another?

16:38.583 --> 16:40.875
Captain, what

16:38.583 --> 16:40.875
are our options, really?

16:40.875 --> 16:43.834
I mean, if this guy

16:40.875 --> 16:43.834
can't get us back, who will?

16:43.834 --> 16:45.458
Captain,

16:43.834 --> 16:45.458
we're here.

16:45.458 --> 16:48.834
Why not avail ourselves

16:45.458 --> 16:48.834
of this opportunity for study?

16:48.834 --> 16:50.625
There is a giant

16:48.834 --> 16:50.625
protostar here

16:50.625 --> 16:52.333
in the process

16:50.625 --> 16:52.333
of forming.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.792
No other vessel has

16:52.333 --> 16:55.792
been out this far.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.125
Spoken like a true

17:00.625 --> 17:02.125
It is tempting,

17:00.625 --> 17:02.125
eh, Number One?

17:02.125 --> 17:03.709
Aye, sir, it is.

17:03.709 --> 17:07.041
But as they say, sir,

17:03.709 --> 17:07.041
you're the Captain.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.875
I know that If Kosinski

17:07.041 --> 17:09.875
can get us home

17:09.875 --> 17:11.875
Starfleet can use

17:09.875 --> 17:11.875
his technique

17:11.875 --> 17:13.709
to bring back

17:11.875 --> 17:13.709
a pure science vessel.

17:13.709 --> 17:15.250
Do even more.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.083
Number One, tell

17:18.583 --> 17:21.083
Kosinski to prepare

17:18.583 --> 17:21.083

17:21.083 --> 17:22.166
Aye, sir.

17:24.625 --> 17:28.500
Do you realize how many

17:24.625 --> 17:28.500
great advancements of mankind

17:28.500 --> 17:30.834
have been tied to speed?

17:30.834 --> 17:32.875
This is a moment in history

17:32.875 --> 17:34.375
right here, right now.

17:34.375 --> 17:38.458
And your names will be

17:42.834 --> 17:44.834
Excuse me,

17:42.834 --> 17:44.834
Commander Riker.

17:44.834 --> 17:48.667
I don't think

17:44.834 --> 17:48.667

17:51.583 --> 17:53.083

17:53.083 --> 17:54.583
I was watching

17:53.083 --> 17:54.583
his assistant...

17:54.583 --> 17:56.458
I'm sure this is

17:54.583 --> 17:56.458
fascinating, Wesley

17:56.458 --> 17:58.166
and I am looking forward

17:56.458 --> 17:58.166
to hearing all about it

17:58.166 --> 18:00.417
but not right now.

18:02.709 --> 18:03.792
Aye, sir.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.959
Come on.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.583
He's too tired.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.875
Why don't you

18:08.583 --> 18:10.875
do it by yourself?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.041
Yes, why not?

18:12.041 --> 18:14.458
Uh, No, I will help.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.208
As you wish.

18:19.041 --> 18:22.959
I've laid in the reciprocal

18:19.041 --> 18:22.959

18:28.583 --> 18:32.458
Tell the Captain

18:28.583 --> 18:32.458
I am ready, first officer.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.458
We're ready for you

18:32.458 --> 18:34.458

18:34.458 --> 18:37.041
As before, begin at warp 1.5.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.333
It wasn't him;

27:10.750 --> 27:12.333
it never was.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.583
It was his

27:12.333 --> 27:14.583
assistant.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.583
What are you talking about?

27:14.583 --> 27:16.750
Kosinski wasn't the one

27:14.583 --> 27:16.750
controlling the warp experiment.

27:16.750 --> 27:17.917
It was me!

27:17.917 --> 27:19.041
The equations

27:17.917 --> 27:19.041
he punched in

27:19.041 --> 27:21.083
were nonsense,

27:19.041 --> 27:21.083
just as we thought.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.250
I honestly thought

27:21.083 --> 27:23.250
it was me.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.333
I thought somehow...

27:26.333 --> 27:28.792
somehow I was operating

27:26.333 --> 27:28.792
on his level.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.166
It was also

27:28.792 --> 27:31.166
my fault, Captain.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.750
I should have realized

27:31.166 --> 27:33.750
it wasn't Kosinski.

27:33.750 --> 27:34.750
How could you?

27:34.750 --> 27:37.625
How could any of us?

27:37.625 --> 27:39.917
Wesley did.

27:41.583 --> 27:44.166
If you knew something,

27:41.583 --> 27:44.166
why didn't you say so?

27:45.375 --> 27:48.000
He tried, twice.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.000
I didn't listen.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.875
He's unconscious.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.125
Why?

27:52.125 --> 27:53.458
I'm not

27:52.125 --> 27:53.458
certain yet.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.000
He phased, sir.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.917
What does that mean?

27:57.917 --> 28:01.625
Parts of him disappeared

27:57.917 --> 28:01.625
and then came back.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.583
Nobody else was

28:01.625 --> 28:04.583
paying attention to

28:01.625 --> 28:04.583
him the first time.

28:04.583 --> 28:05.834
When we saw

28:04.583 --> 28:05.834
it this time

28:05.834 --> 28:08.041
he seemed to

28:05.834 --> 28:08.041
be struggling,

28:05.834 --> 28:08.041
fighting it.

28:08.041 --> 28:09.500
BEVERLY:

28:08.041 --> 28:09.500
He's dying.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.834
He mustn't.

28:10.834 --> 28:13.291
He's the only one

28:10.834 --> 28:13.291
who can get us back.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.959
Realistically, that

28:13.291 --> 28:15.959
doesn't seem possible.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.208
Commander Riker.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.917
He knows.

29:05.917 --> 29:08.500
We all know.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.917
Will he live?

29:09.917 --> 29:13.208
I'm not sure.

29:13.208 --> 29:14.667
Wake him.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.959
I recommend we let

29:14.667 --> 29:16.959
him come around

29:14.667 --> 29:16.959
on his own time.

29:16.959 --> 29:18.709
We don't have that luxury.

29:16.959 --> 29:18.709
Wake him.

29:18.709 --> 29:22.500
He could die,

29:18.709 --> 29:22.500
and with him any

29:18.709 --> 29:22.500
chance we have.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.625
Doctor, Wes...

29:24.625 --> 29:26.917
we all have other friends

29:24.625 --> 29:26.917
on board this ship.

29:26.917 --> 29:29.709
If we stay here much longer,

29:26.917 --> 29:29.709
we may lose the ability

29:29.709 --> 29:31.917
to distinguish between

29:29.709 --> 29:31.917
thought and reality.

29:31.917 --> 29:35.250
Now, regardless of the risk,

29:31.917 --> 29:35.250
wake him now.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.000
(<i> hissing</i> )

29:59.000 --> 30:01.250
Do you recognize me?

30:01.250 --> 30:02.792
I'm the Captain

30:01.250 --> 30:02.792
and I need answers.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.333
I'll do my best...

30:06.333 --> 30:08.834
to provide.

30:08.834 --> 30:11.834
Who are you?

30:08.834 --> 30:11.834
Or what?

30:11.834 --> 30:15.250
I am a traveler.

30:15.250 --> 30:17.875
A traveler?

30:17.875 --> 30:18.875
What is your destination?

30:18.875 --> 30:21.959
TRAVELER:

30:18.875 --> 30:21.959
Destination?

30:21.959 --> 30:24.417
Yes, what place are

30:21.959 --> 30:24.417
you trying to reach?

30:24.417 --> 30:25.959
Ah, place, no.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.959
There is no specific place

30:25.959 --> 30:28.959
I wish to go.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.583
Then what is

30:28.959 --> 30:31.583
the purpose of your journey?

30:31.583 --> 30:33.542
Curiosity.

30:33.542 --> 30:35.000
PICARD:

30:33.542 --> 30:35.000
That's not

30:33.542 --> 30:35.000
an answer.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.917
TRAVELER:

30:35.000 --> 30:36.917
I have certain

30:35.000 --> 30:36.917
abilities.

30:36.917 --> 30:40.291
They give me a knowledge

30:36.917 --> 30:40.291
of propulsion.

30:40.291 --> 30:42.125
I've been trading

30:40.291 --> 30:42.125
this for passage

30:42.125 --> 30:43.709
on Starfleet

30:42.125 --> 30:43.709
vessels.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.125
RIKER:

30:43.709 --> 30:45.125
And allowing Kosinski

30:43.709 --> 30:45.125
to take credit

30:45.125 --> 30:46.375
for what you did?

30:46.375 --> 30:48.125
TRAVELER:

30:46.375 --> 30:48.125
It seemed

30:46.375 --> 30:48.125
the sensible way.

30:48.125 --> 30:50.875
Until now.

30:50.875 --> 30:53.625
Captain, I seek

30:50.875 --> 30:53.625
only transportation

30:53.625 --> 30:57.291
in order to see

30:53.625 --> 30:57.291
and experience your reality.

30:57.291 --> 30:59.625
I am no threat

30:57.291 --> 30:59.625
to you,

30:59.625 --> 31:01.750
your ship or your crew.

31:01.750 --> 31:04.166
He isn't, Captain.

31:01.750 --> 31:04.166
I know he isn't.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.375
PICARD:

31:04.166 --> 31:06.375
Our "reality"?

31:06.375 --> 31:09.000
And in order to satisfy

31:06.375 --> 31:09.000
this curiosity

31:09.000 --> 31:10.208
you have brought my ship

31:10.208 --> 31:12.917
and my crew

31:10.208 --> 31:12.917
into grave risk.

31:12.917 --> 31:14.959
I have made some mistakes.

31:14.959 --> 31:16.166
Some mistakes?

31:16.166 --> 31:17.834
What mistakes could

31:16.166 --> 31:17.834
possibly explain

31:17.834 --> 31:20.959
these incredible explosions

31:17.834 --> 31:20.959
of velocity?

31:23.583 --> 31:27.709
I don't know if I can put this

31:23.583 --> 31:27.709
in terms you'll understand.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.041
I believe that there

31:29.583 --> 31:32.041
may be a warp speed

31:32.041 --> 31:35.792
that can get us

31:32.041 --> 31:35.792
beyond galaxy M-33

31:35.792 --> 31:39.834
but there is no velocity

31:35.792 --> 31:39.834
of any magnitude

31:39.834 --> 31:41.875
that can possibly bring us...

31:41.875 --> 31:44.250
wherever this is.

31:44.250 --> 31:47.041
Is it true what our navigational

31:44.250 --> 31:47.041
sensors are telling us?

31:47.041 --> 31:50.291
Are we... are we

31:47.041 --> 31:50.291
millions of light-years away

31:50.291 --> 31:52.333
from where we were?

31:52.333 --> 31:54.875
Yes.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.583
But what

31:54.875 --> 31:56.583
got us here?

31:56.583 --> 31:57.583
Thought.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.542
Thought?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.000
You do understand,

31:58.542 --> 32:00.000
don't you

32:00.000 --> 32:02.667
that thought is the basis

32:00.000 --> 32:02.667
of all reality?

32:02.667 --> 32:05.959
The energy of thought--

32:02.667 --> 32:05.959
to put it in your terms--

32:05.959 --> 32:07.875
is very powerful.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.834
That's not an

32:07.875 --> 32:09.834
explanation.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.166
I have

32:09.834 --> 32:11.166
the ability

32:11.166 --> 32:14.875
to act like a lens

32:11.166 --> 32:14.875
which focuses thought.

32:16.291 --> 32:18.667
That's just

32:16.291 --> 32:18.667
so much nonsense.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.834
You're asking us

32:18.667 --> 32:20.834
to believe in magic.

32:22.500 --> 32:26.375
Well, yes, this... this could

32:22.500 --> 32:26.375
seem like magic to you.

32:26.375 --> 32:27.583
PICARD:

32:26.375 --> 32:27.583
No.

32:27.583 --> 32:31.417
No, it actually

32:27.583 --> 32:31.417
makes sense to me.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.375
Only the power of

32:33.250 --> 32:35.375
thought could explain

32:35.375 --> 32:37.333
what has been happening,

32:35.375 --> 32:37.333
especially out here.

32:37.333 --> 32:41.333
Thought is the essence

32:37.333 --> 32:41.333
of where you are now.

32:41.333 --> 32:44.208
You do understand

32:41.333 --> 32:44.208
the danger, don't you?

32:44.208 --> 32:45.458
Chaos.

32:45.458 --> 32:46.792
What we think is what happens.

32:46.792 --> 32:50.709
It pains me I was

32:46.792 --> 32:50.709
so careless, Captain.

32:50.709 --> 32:54.000
My intent was only to observe,

32:50.709 --> 32:54.000
not to cause this.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.959
You should not be here until

32:54.000 --> 32:57.959
your far, far distant future.

32:57.959 --> 33:01.333
Certainly not until

32:57.959 --> 33:01.333
you've learned control.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.625
You are from a different time,

33:01.333 --> 33:03.625
aren't you?

33:03.625 --> 33:06.875
No, not exactly

33:03.625 --> 33:06.875
from another time...

33:06.875 --> 33:10.709
well, as you understand

33:06.875 --> 33:10.709
the concept...

33:10.709 --> 33:14.375
yes, perhaps that term

33:10.709 --> 33:14.375
fits as well as any.

33:14.375 --> 33:16.083
And you have

33:14.375 --> 33:16.083
this ability

33:16.083 --> 33:17.709
to travel?

33:16.083 --> 33:17.709
Yes.

33:17.709 --> 33:19.542
And others of your kind

33:17.709 --> 33:19.542
have the same ability?

33:19.542 --> 33:21.125
Oh, yes.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.125
Then why...

33:21.125 --> 33:23.166
in all of our history,

33:21.125 --> 33:23.166
is there no record of you

33:23.166 --> 33:24.625
or someone like you

33:23.166 --> 33:24.625
ever having visited us?

33:25.792 --> 33:27.750
What wonderful arrogance.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.250
There is no record

33:29.250 --> 33:31.583
because we have not

33:29.250 --> 33:31.583
visited you before.

33:31.583 --> 33:32.583
Why not?

33:32.583 --> 33:34.667
Well, because...

33:34.667 --> 33:37.834
up until now,

33:34.667 --> 33:37.834
if you'll forgive this

33:37.834 --> 33:40.750
you've been uninteresting.

33:40.750 --> 33:44.000
It's only now

33:40.750 --> 33:44.000
that your life-form

33:44.000 --> 33:45.583
merits serious attention.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.750
I...

33:47.750 --> 33:49.667
I'm-I'm sorry.

33:51.667 --> 33:52.792
What's happening?

33:52.792 --> 33:55.083
He's unconscious again.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.917
PICARD:

33:55.083 --> 33:56.917
Revive him.

33:56.917 --> 33:59.875
Whatever you need from him,

33:56.917 --> 33:59.875
you better get it soon.

33:59.875 --> 34:01.834
If I may suggest, sir,

33:59.875 --> 34:01.834
our first leap

34:01.834 --> 34:04.291
out of our galaxy was,

34:01.834 --> 34:04.291
as he said, a mistake.

34:04.291 --> 34:07.250
PICARD:

34:04.291 --> 34:07.250
Unless he was distracted

34:04.291 --> 34:07.250
by something.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.959
RIKER:

34:07.250 --> 34:08.959
And it weakened him

34:08.959 --> 34:11.750
in some way resulting

34:08.959 --> 34:11.750
in the incredible leap out here.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.166
Theory.

34:13.166 --> 34:16.166
Do you have any facts

34:13.166 --> 34:16.166
that fit this?

34:16.166 --> 34:17.125
Can you get us back?

34:17.125 --> 34:19.792
Wait, Captain,

34:17.125 --> 34:19.792
not so fast.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.458
We have an opportunity here

34:19.792 --> 34:22.458
for scientific discovery.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.333
And we report

34:22.458 --> 34:24.333
our observations how?

34:24.333 --> 34:26.500
To whom?

34:28.291 --> 34:30.709
Can you get us back?

34:30.709 --> 34:32.875
I will try.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.125
Number One, take him down

34:34.667 --> 34:37.125
to main Engineering.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.291
I'll be on

34:37.125 --> 34:38.291
the Bridge.

34:38.291 --> 34:39.917
No!

34:39.917 --> 34:41.750
He's very weak.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.750
The Captain is right--

34:41.750 --> 34:44.750
we must hurry.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.750
But first I request

34:44.750 --> 34:48.750
a moment with the Captain...

34:48.750 --> 34:50.542
alone.

35:09.166 --> 35:11.125
Strange how he seems

35:09.166 --> 35:11.125
to care for you.

35:11.125 --> 35:13.166
He will forget me

35:11.125 --> 35:13.166
in time,

35:13.166 --> 35:16.709
which is

35:13.166 --> 35:16.709
as it should be.

35:16.709 --> 35:19.625
It's Wesley I wanted

35:16.709 --> 35:19.625
to speak to you about.

35:16.709 --> 35:19.625
The boy?

35:19.625 --> 35:22.291
It's best you do

35:19.625 --> 35:22.291
not repeat this

35:19.625 --> 35:22.291
to the others--

35:22.291 --> 35:23.625
especially not

35:22.291 --> 35:23.625
to the mother.

35:23.625 --> 35:25.000
Whatever happens

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
it is imperative that

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
it proceed naturally.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.750
I must get

35:28.000 --> 35:29.750
my ship back.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.125
Do we have time for this?

35:31.125 --> 35:33.083
Oh, yes.

35:33.083 --> 35:36.959
He and a few like him

35:33.083 --> 35:36.959
are why I travel.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.083
You have it

35:41.500 --> 35:43.083
in your power

35:43.083 --> 35:45.750
to encourage him

35:43.083 --> 35:45.750
without interfering.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.500
Encourage him in what?

35:47.500 --> 35:49.875
How shall I explain?

35:49.875 --> 35:52.083
Are you familiar

35:49.875 --> 35:52.083
with the intricacies

35:52.083 --> 35:54.500
of what is

35:52.083 --> 35:54.500
called here "music"?

35:54.500 --> 35:55.709
Somewhat.

35:55.709 --> 35:57.333
And such musical genius

35:57.333 --> 35:59.375
as I saw in one

35:57.333 --> 35:59.375
of your ships' libraries--

35:59.375 --> 36:00.834
one called Mozart

36:00.834 --> 36:04.458
who as a small child

36:00.834 --> 36:04.458
wrote astonishing symphonies.

36:04.458 --> 36:05.792
A genius

36:05.792 --> 36:08.083
who made music

36:05.792 --> 36:08.083
not only to be heard

36:08.083 --> 36:10.542
but seen and felt

36:10.542 --> 36:13.875
beyond the understanding,

36:10.542 --> 36:13.875
the ability of others.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.792
Wesley is such a person.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.417
Not with music

36:17.417 --> 36:20.000
but with the equally

36:17.417 --> 36:20.000
lovely intricacies

36:20.000 --> 36:22.375
of time, energy,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.375
propulsion...

36:22.375 --> 36:24.917
and the instruments

36:22.375 --> 36:24.917
of this vessel

36:24.917 --> 36:27.667
which allow

36:24.917 --> 36:27.667
all that to be played.

36:28.875 --> 36:31.208
You're right.

36:28.875 --> 36:31.208
I must hurry now

36:31.208 --> 36:32.792
but you're right

36:31.208 --> 36:32.792
in something else.

36:32.792 --> 36:34.625
He is just a boy for now.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.875
He should be encouraged

36:35.875 --> 36:38.333
but told

36:35.875 --> 36:38.333
none of this.

36:41.542 --> 36:42.709
We've got to

36:41.542 --> 36:42.709
get back home.

36:42.709 --> 36:43.709
Take him to

36:42.709 --> 36:43.709
main Engineering.

36:43.709 --> 36:44.834
Yes, sir.

36:44.834 --> 36:46.375
I'll be on

36:44.834 --> 36:46.375
the Bridge.

36:44.834 --> 36:46.375
Yes, sir.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.834
(<i> gasping</i> )

36:54.625 --> 36:56.250
Put it out!

36:54.625 --> 36:56.250
How?

36:56.250 --> 36:57.792
Think!

36:57.792 --> 37:00.458
Put the flame

36:57.792 --> 37:00.458
out in your thoughts.

37:01.542 --> 37:05.458
(<i> gasping, groaning</i> )

37:12.417 --> 37:13.500
Now, get to your station

37:13.500 --> 37:15.000
and concentrate on

37:13.500 --> 37:15.000
your assignment.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.125
Yes, sir.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.500
<i>Captain's Log:</i>

37:22.500 --> 37:24.875
<i>Any</i> time<i> entry is meaningless.</i>

37:24.875 --> 37:26.792
<i>We have no choice</i>

37:24.875 --> 37:26.792
<i>but to repeat</i>

37:26.792 --> 37:28.417
<i>the same warp experiment</i>

37:28.417 --> 37:30.375
<i>but with one variation.</i>

37:30.375 --> 37:33.083
<i>A principal part</i>

37:30.375 --> 37:33.083
<i>of this warp formula</i>

37:33.083 --> 37:34.417
<i>will be the thoughts</i>

37:34.417 --> 37:36.500
<i>of everyone aboard</i>

37:34.417 --> 37:36.500
<i>the</i> Enterprise.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.875
<i>We have no idea exactly</i>

37:36.500 --> 37:38.875
<i>how this works.</i>

37:38.875 --> 37:41.834
<i>We understand only</i>

37:38.875 --> 37:41.834
<i>that the traveler</i>

37:41.834 --> 37:43.792
<i>makes use of this somehow.</i>

37:43.792 --> 37:46.166
<i>It will be most important</i>

37:43.792 --> 37:46.166
<i>that those aboard avoid</i>

37:46.166 --> 37:49.125
<i>random thoughts that might</i>

37:46.166 --> 37:49.125
<i>change the reality</i>

37:49.125 --> 37:50.875
<i>of what we're attempting to do.</i>

37:55.083 --> 37:56.875
Do you have any

37:55.083 --> 37:56.875
further advice, Counselor?

37:56.875 --> 37:59.834
When you begin the attempt,

37:56.875 --> 37:59.834
there will be stress

37:59.834 --> 38:01.875
and it's only

37:59.834 --> 38:01.875
natural the crew's

38:01.875 --> 38:03.792
concentration

38:01.875 --> 38:03.792
will shift.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.667
Plus some genuine fear, Captain.

38:06.667 --> 38:08.834
You can't notice

38:06.667 --> 38:08.834
what's happening outside

38:08.834 --> 38:09.917
without feeling some of that.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.583
(<i> boatswain's whistle blows</i> )

38:12.583 --> 38:14.750
All decks, all stations

38:14.750 --> 38:16.875
<i>this is the Captain speaking.</i>

38:16.875 --> 38:19.250
<i>All decks, I must have</i>

38:16.875 --> 38:19.250
<i>your full attention.</i>

38:19.250 --> 38:22.875
<i>In a few moments,</i>

38:19.250 --> 38:22.875
<i>as we attempt to warp back home</i>

38:22.875 --> 38:25.417
<i>it is vital--</i>

38:22.875 --> 38:25.417
<i>absolutely vital--</i>

38:25.417 --> 38:29.041
<i>that you center your thoughts</i>

38:25.417 --> 38:29.041
<i>on your duty</i>

38:29.041 --> 38:32.000
<i>or on the welfare</i>

38:29.041 --> 38:32.000
<i>of the one called the traveler.</i>

38:32.000 --> 38:35.875
<i>Think of giving him</i>

38:32.000 --> 38:35.875
<i>some of your strength.</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:37.542
<i>Now, this is an order.</i>

38:37.542 --> 38:39.834
<i>You must try to do this.</i>

38:39.834 --> 38:42.166
And, now...

38:42.166 --> 38:45.000
attempt to concentrate

38:42.166 --> 38:45.000
completely

38:45.000 --> 38:47.542
on your duty of the moment

38:47.542 --> 38:49.583
or on the traveler

38:49.583 --> 38:51.291
on his well-being.

38:51.291 --> 38:55.500
<i>Think of him as someone</i>

38:51.291 --> 38:55.500
<i>you care deeply for.</i>

38:58.375 --> 39:01.875
All decks, all stations--

39:01.875 --> 39:03.333
battle stations.

39:03.333 --> 39:06.625
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

39:06.625 --> 39:09.959
I will need Kosinski

39:06.625 --> 39:09.959
back on the main computer.

39:12.333 --> 39:15.333
You need me?

39:15.333 --> 39:16.834
Yes.

39:23.333 --> 39:26.875
Helm, set in warp 1.5,

39:23.333 --> 39:26.875
retroactive course.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.834
LA FORGE:

39:26.875 --> 39:28.834
Warp 1.5

39:28.834 --> 39:31.542
retroactive 2-6-1

39:31.542 --> 39:34.458
mark 3-1, sir.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.375
Bridge to Engineering,

39:34.458 --> 39:36.375
stand by.

39:38.750 --> 39:41.709
I feel such an abundance

39:38.750 --> 39:41.709
of well-being on the ship.

39:42.917 --> 39:46.166
It feels like...

39:46.166 --> 39:48.333
...quite wonderful.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.917
RIKER:

39:48.333 --> 39:50.917
<i>Engineering to Bridge,</i>

39:48.333 --> 39:50.917
<i>we're ready.</i>

39:52.625 --> 39:54.959
On my order, Mr. Data,

39:52.625 --> 39:54.959
Mr. La Forge.

39:59.291 --> 40:00.583
Engage.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.208
It's not happening.

40:32.208 --> 40:34.458
It's not enough.

41:39.375 --> 41:40.792
Warp 1.5, sir--

41:40.792 --> 41:43.959
which is what

41:40.792 --> 41:43.959
my instruments

41:40.792 --> 41:43.959
have read all along.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.917
And our position reads

41:43.959 --> 41:45.917
exactly what it was

41:45.917 --> 41:49.041
before this sleigh ride

41:45.917 --> 41:49.041
began, sir.

41:49.041 --> 41:50.583
Cease red alert.

41:50.583 --> 41:51.959
Sleigh ride?

41:51.959 --> 41:53.750
Or whatever you want

41:51.959 --> 41:53.750
to call it, Data.

41:53.750 --> 41:56.542
I don't have

41:53.750 --> 41:56.542
a proper name for it.

41:56.542 --> 41:57.959
The traveler's

41:56.542 --> 41:57.959
gone, sir.

41:57.959 --> 41:59.083
Gone?

41:59.083 --> 42:00.208
He's phased...

42:00.208 --> 42:01.917
completely out

42:00.208 --> 42:01.917
of existence--

42:01.917 --> 42:05.208
at least out

42:01.917 --> 42:05.208
of our existence.

42:05.208 --> 42:06.625
(<i> boatswain's whistle blows</i> )

42:06.625 --> 42:08.625
Attention all decks.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.583
This is to inform you

42:08.625 --> 42:11.583
that with your support

42:11.583 --> 42:15.125
the traveler has returned us

42:11.583 --> 42:15.125
to our own galaxy.

42:15.125 --> 42:18.458
However, he has now left us.

42:19.917 --> 42:22.291
Wherever he has gone,

42:22.291 --> 42:24.417
we wish him well.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.333
Have the boy sent to the Bridge,

42:25.709 --> 42:28.333
Number One.

42:28.333 --> 42:30.917
Wesley Crusher,

42:28.333 --> 42:30.917
report to the Bridge.

42:30.917 --> 42:32.792
On the double.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.375
Our next assignment

42:32.792 --> 42:34.375
is on this heading?

42:34.375 --> 42:35.875
Yes, sir.

42:35.875 --> 42:37.166
Mr. Data,

42:35.875 --> 42:37.166
Mr. La Forge

42:37.166 --> 42:39.166
increase to warp five,

42:37.166 --> 42:39.166
same heading.

42:39.166 --> 42:40.500
Warp five, sir.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.000
On that same heading, sir.

42:43.083 --> 42:46.583
Oh, Wesley,

42:43.083 --> 42:46.583
come on the Bridge.

42:46.583 --> 42:47.917
Move!

42:51.709 --> 42:52.917
Commander Riker has told me

42:52.917 --> 42:54.834
how supportive you were

42:52.917 --> 42:54.834
in Engineering.

42:54.834 --> 42:56.375
Well done.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.583
Oh, at ease.

42:58.583 --> 43:00.208
Sit here in command.

43:00.208 --> 43:01.959
RIKER:

43:00.208 --> 43:01.959
Captain,

43:00.208 --> 43:01.959
it's not allowed.

43:01.959 --> 43:04.375
Your orders.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.542
Oh, that's true.

43:06.542 --> 43:10.625
Well, uh, I, uh,

43:06.542 --> 43:10.625
can't waive them again.

43:12.375 --> 43:14.667
Only commissioned officers.

43:14.667 --> 43:17.375
It's quite all right, sir.

43:14.667 --> 43:17.375
I understand.

43:17.375 --> 43:19.375
Please don't

43:17.375 --> 43:19.375
interrupt me, Wesley.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.709
I'm sorry, sir.

43:23.375 --> 43:25.041
Any commissioned rank?

43:25.041 --> 43:27.542
Even Ensign?

43:27.542 --> 43:30.709
That would give him

43:27.542 --> 43:30.709
authorized access

43:27.542 --> 43:30.709
to the Bridge.

43:30.709 --> 43:34.250
Well, then, I'll have to

43:30.709 --> 43:34.250
make him an acting Ensign.

43:36.583 --> 43:38.041
Captain's Log,

43:38.041 --> 43:41.500
Stardate 41263.4:

43:42.667 --> 43:44.375
For outstanding

43:42.667 --> 43:44.375
performance

43:44.375 --> 43:45.834
in the best

43:44.375 --> 43:45.834
Starfleet tradition

43:45.834 --> 43:48.166
Wesley Crusher is

43:45.834 --> 43:48.166
made acting Ensign

43:48.166 --> 43:51.834
with the duties

43:48.166 --> 43:51.834
and privileges

43:48.166 --> 43:51.834
of that rank

43:51.834 --> 43:55.458
and whether that rank

43:51.834 --> 43:55.458
becomes permanent, Mr. Crusher

43:55.458 --> 43:57.083
depends on you.

43:57.083 --> 43:59.458
At the earliest opportunity,

43:57.083 --> 43:59.458
your entrance application

43:59.458 --> 44:02.041
for Starfleet Academy

43:59.458 --> 44:02.041
will be tendered.

44:02.041 --> 44:04.417
Until then,

44:02.041 --> 44:04.417
you will learn this ship--

44:04.417 --> 44:06.166
every operation, every function.

44:06.166 --> 44:09.792
Commander Riker, a duty

44:06.166 --> 44:09.792
schedule for Mr. Crusher

44:09.792 --> 44:11.166
heavy on study.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.625
Aye, sir.

44:12.625 --> 44:16.417
Meanwhile, you can sit here

44:12.625 --> 44:16.417
and learn something.

44:20.583 --> 44:23.291
Sir, should I send

44:20.583 --> 44:23.291
for Dr. Crusher?

44:23.291 --> 44:25.125
Why, is someone ill?

44:25.125 --> 44:28.000
Or would you rather

44:25.125 --> 44:28.000
tell her about this, Wes?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.542
If you don't mind, sir

44:29.542 --> 44:31.083
I'd like to sit here

44:29.542 --> 44:31.083
for a while.

44:31.083 --> 44:32.417
I'll tell her later.
