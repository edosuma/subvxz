20:36.467 --> 20:38.300
OH, GUESS WHAT.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.633
WE GOT A MENTION
ON MYSPACE. SEE?

20:40.667 --> 20:42.900
AND WE TOOK OUT AN AD
ON OUR CHART.

20:42.933 --> 20:44.567
WHY, THANK YOU.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.600
HOW DOES IT WORK,
THIS CHART OF YOURS?

20:46.633 --> 20:47.733
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
BEEN ON--

20:47.767 --> 20:49.733
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON OUR CHART?

20:49.767 --> 20:51.200
WHAT? OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO MUCH FUN.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.633
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE MISSING.

20:52.667 --> 20:53.700
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
A SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE.

20:53.733 --> 20:54.933
FOR LESBIANS.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.133
DO YOU HAVE TO
SLEEP WITH SOMEONE FIRST?

20:56.167 --> 20:57.467
WELL, I MEAN, WHEN
I FIRST PUT IT UP,

20:57.500 --> 20:58.733
THAT WAS THE CORE CONCEPT.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.100
YOU KNOW,
JENNY SLEPT WITH TINA

21:00.133 --> 21:01.100
WHO SLEPT WITH ANNIE
WHO SLEPT WITH--

21:01.133 --> 21:02.467
YOU SLEPT WITH TINA?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.900
NO. I'D NEVER
SLEEP WITH TINA!

21:03.933 --> 21:05.233
HYPOTHETICAL.

21:05.267 --> 21:07.100
BUT, LIKE, LESBIANS
BEING LESBIANS,

21:07.133 --> 21:08.300
THEY STARTED LOGGING ON

21:08.333 --> 21:09.333
AND TALKING
ABOUT THEMSELVES

21:09.367 --> 21:10.067
AND, YOU KNOW...

21:10.100 --> 21:12.067
YEAH.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.933
BUT FOR ME IT'S STILL
ABOUT THE HOOK-UP PAGE.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.100
SEE, LIKE, HERE'S ME,

21:16.133 --> 21:17.600
AND THEN
THAT'S MY WHOLE CONSTELLATION.

21:17.633 --> 21:19.333
AND I SLEPT
WITH GABBY DEVEAUX

21:19.367 --> 21:21.333
SO I WANT TO ADD HER
TO MY CONSTELLATION.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.433
SO I SUBMIT HER NAME

21:22.467 --> 21:23.567
AND THE WEBMASTER

21:23.600 --> 21:25.267
WILL EMAIL HER SAYING,
YOU KNOW,

21:25.300 --> 21:27.167
ALICE PIESZECKI HAS
ADDED YOUR NAME

21:27.200 --> 21:28.700
TO OUR CHART

21:28.733 --> 21:30.200
AND WOULD LIKE TO PUT YOU
ON HER HOOK-UPS PAGE.

21:30.233 --> 21:31.533
AND, THEN, IF SHE GIVES
PERMISSION,

21:31.567 --> 21:32.767
THEN SHE HAS THE CHOICE

21:32.800 --> 21:34.567
OF STARTING
HER OWN CONSTELLATION.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
THERE'S GABBY DEVEAUX.
RIGHT.

21:35.633 --> 21:36.700
WHOA, THAT'S A LOT
OF HOOK-UPS.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.367
YEAH, SHE'S A WHORE.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.800
YEAH.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.067
BUT, UM, LET'S SEE--
HAVE YOU SEEN SHANE?

21:41.067 --> 21:43.233
YEAH, YEAH,
CAN I SHOW YOU--

21:43.267 --> 21:46.067
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO THEN
CLICK ON SHANE'S NAME...

21:46.067 --> 21:50.267
YOU CAN THEN SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE
SHANE'S HOOKED UP WITH.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.633
[ALICE]:
SHE'S WHAT WE CALL A HUB,

21:51.667 --> 21:52.800
WHICH IS ANYONE

21:52.833 --> 21:54.067
WHO'S SLEPT WITH
OVER 50 PEOPLE.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.433
SHANE'S CONSIDERED
THE HUB OF HUBS.

21:55.467 --> 21:56.733
RIGHT, AND ONCE
YOU BECOME A HUB,

21:56.767 --> 21:57.900
THEN YOU SORT OF
BECOME A PORTAL,

21:57.933 --> 21:59.167
BECAUSE, INEVITABLY,
YOU'RE GOING TO, LIKE,

21:59.200 --> 22:00.933
BRING US INTO
A WHOLE NEW SOLAR SYSTEM.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.200
YEAH, LOOK,
DO YOU REMEMBER

22:02.233 --> 22:03.700
THAT JAPANESE GIRL
THAT SHANE SLEPT WITH?

22:03.733 --> 22:05.567
WELL, NOW
THE JAPANESE GIRL

22:05.600 --> 22:06.767
IN KYOTO

22:06.800 --> 22:08.767
HAS HER WHOLE NEW
SOLAR SYSTEM OUT THERE.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.933
YEAH.
YEAH.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.167
SHOULD WE LOOK AT
CARMEN?

22:11.200 --> 22:12.467
WELL, YEAH, I THINK

22:12.500 --> 22:13.633
WE COULD LEAVE CARMEN
OUT OF IT.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.267
OKAY, SO, LOOK.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.067
CARMEN HAS
HER WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM--

22:17.100 --> 22:18.900
WOW.
...IN EAST L.A.

22:18.933 --> 22:20.067
I CAN SEE THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.533
THERE'S, LIKE, ROSA,
MARILENA--

22:21.567 --> 22:23.500
I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL.

22:23.533 --> 22:25.067
OH, YEAH,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

22:25.067 --> 22:26.267
UPGRADE THE SERVER

22:26.300 --> 22:27.700
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING
SO MUCH TRAFFIC.

22:27.733 --> 22:29.367
WHAT'S THE TERM YOU SAY YOU USE
WHEN THERE'S GROUP OF GIRLS--

22:29.400 --> 22:30.067
SOLAR SYSTEM.
YEAH.

22:30.067 --> 22:31.533
THERE'S A GIRL HERE

22:31.567 --> 22:34.367
IN CARMEN'S SOLAR SYSTEM,
SHE'S GOT MORE HITS THAN SHANE.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.467
OH, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.100
NO. NO WAY.
NO.

22:37.133 --> 22:38.567
CAN I HAVE MY COMPUTER NOW?

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
YEAH. LOOK.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.100
OH, MY GOD.

22:42.133 --> 22:43.267
YOU'RE RIGHT!

22:43.300 --> 22:44.767
LOOK AT THIS.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.067
THIS GIRL HAS SLEPT...

22:47.067 --> 22:48.300
WITH ONE THOUSAND, ONE HUNDRED--

22:48.333 --> 22:49.767
[ALL GASPING]

22:49.800 --> 22:51.133
SHE JUST ADDED A NAME!

22:51.167 --> 22:52.167
WAIT, LET ME GO--

22:52.200 --> 22:53.333
NOW IT'S 1,151!
LET ME GO IN.

22:53.367 --> 22:54.467
ALL RIGHT, RELAX.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.433
LET ME GO IN.

22:55.467 --> 22:57.100
I GOT TO SEE
WHO THIS IS.

22:57.133 --> 22:59.267
WHO THE HELL IS PAPI?

22:59.300 --> 23:01.167
I THINK WARREN HAS TOO MUCH
ON HIS PLATE.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.800
I GOING TO HAVE YOU
RUN POINT

23:02.833 --> 23:04.467
ON THE PYROTECH PROJECT.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.667
OH...

23:05.700 --> 23:07.767
THANKS. THANKS, BOSS.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.600
HOW'S EVERYTHING ELSE GOING
FOR YOU, MAX?

23:10.633 --> 23:11.700
JUST GREAT.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.067
I SHOULD HAVE
THESE UPDATES NAILED

23:13.067 --> 23:14.133
BY THE END
OF THE WEEK.

23:14.167 --> 23:15.200
HOW'S JENNY?

23:15.233 --> 23:17.567
SHE'S FINE.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.833
ACTUALLY, WE BROKE UP.

23:18.867 --> 23:20.867
OH. I'M SORRY.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.100
I'M FINE WITH IT.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.067
WELL...

23:24.100 --> 23:25.967
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M OUT OF LINE, MAX,

23:26.067 --> 23:27.400
BUT I'M NOT
ALL THAT SURPRISED.

23:27.433 --> 23:30.167
YEAH, I MEAN, WE DEFINITELY
HAD OUR PROBLEMS.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.233
YOU'RE A VERY STRAIGHT AHEAD
PERSON.

23:32.267 --> 23:33.567
YOU DON'T REALLY SEEM TO HAVE
ANY HIDDEN AGENDAS,

23:33.600 --> 23:37.833
AND JENNY SEEMED
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.933
SHE SURE IS COMPLICATED.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.833
LOOK, UH...

23:43.867 --> 23:46.700
I KNOW THIS MIGHT SEEM
A LITTLE OUT OF LEFT FIELD,

23:46.733 --> 23:47.933
BUT MY DAUGHTER BROOKE'S
COMING HOME

23:47.967 --> 23:49.800
FROM MT. HOLYOKE
THIS WEEKEND,

23:49.833 --> 23:51.267
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT

23:51.300 --> 23:52.467
THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD HIT IT OFF.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.600
YOUR DAUGHTER?

23:53.633 --> 23:54.667
I'LL I.M. YOU

23:54.700 --> 23:55.900
HER PHONE NUMBER.

23:55.933 --> 23:57.100
YOU CAN CALL HER
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT.

23:57.133 --> 23:58.833
NO OBLIGATION.

23:58.867 --> 24:00.767
HONESTLY.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.400
OH, FUCK.

24:11.167 --> 24:13.800
I'M GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO COME.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.467
COME TO MAMA,
SWEETIE.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.133
MAMA'S NEVER GOING TO
LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.167
COME HERE, SWEETIE.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.467
YEAH.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.633
COME HERE, MY BABY.

24:24.667 --> 24:26.500
COME HERE,
MY BABY.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.467
I MISSED YOU.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.967
[TINA COOING]

24:31.067 --> 24:32.533
[TINA KISSES ANGELICA]

24:32.567 --> 24:33.933
YES. MY BABY...

24:33.967 --> 24:35.067
I LOOKED LIKE A GUY,

24:35.100 --> 24:37.100
BUT I DIDN'T FIT
IN THE STRAIGHT WORLD,

24:37.133 --> 24:39.100
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I DIDN'T FIT

24:39.133 --> 24:40.467
IN THE DYKE COMMUNITY
EITHER.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.467
I HAD NO IDEA

24:41.500 --> 24:43.233
IT WOULD BE
SO DAMN LONELY.

24:43.267 --> 24:44.567
AND THE WORST THING WAS,
I COULDN'T CRY.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
THAT WAS

24:45.633 --> 24:46.600
THE HARSHEST
THING FOR ME.

24:46.633 --> 24:48.067
WHEN THE TESTOSTERONE
KICKED IN,

24:48.067 --> 24:49.300
MY EMOTIONS
TOTALLY CHANGED,

24:49.333 --> 24:50.367
AND I COULDN'T EVEN
CRY ANYMORE.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.200
I NEVER STOPPED CRYING,
PERSONALLY,

24:53.233 --> 24:54.533
BUT NOBODY REALLY PREPARES YOU

24:54.567 --> 24:56.467
FOR WHAT YOUR BODY'S
GOING TO GO THROUGH.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.100
AT LEAST BOYS,
WHEN THEY START PUBERTY,

24:58.133 --> 25:00.633
THEY HAVE, YOU KNOW,
SEX EDUCATION.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.200
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE
I COULD GO

25:02.233 --> 25:04.133
TO FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION?

25:04.167 --> 25:07.867
WHEN I GOT MY T,
I GOT IF FROM MY FRIEND,

25:07.900 --> 25:09.300
IT WAS SORT OF SMUGGLED,
OR WHATEVER, SO--

25:09.333 --> 25:11.067
OH, JEEZ.

25:11.067 --> 25:12.733
WHAT DOSAGE
ARE YOU ON, DUDE?

25:12.767 --> 25:14.800
200, LIKE, EVERY WEEK--

25:14.833 --> 25:16.100
WHOO.

25:16.133 --> 25:17.567
I STARTED OUT--
A WEEK?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.167
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT CAN DO TO YOUR LIVER?

25:19.200 --> 25:21.067
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR PERSONALITY.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.500
DO YOU GOT ANY FRIENDS LEFT,
MAN?

25:22.533 --> 25:25.833
YEAH, I DO,
BUT IT'S BEEN PRETTY MESSED UP.

25:25.867 --> 25:27.700
I MEAN,
I FREAK OUT A LOT.

25:27.733 --> 25:29.833
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
I CAME HERE.

25:29.867 --> 25:31.200
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD HELP ME OUT.

25:31.233 --> 25:32.800
WE'RE GOING TO
GIVE YOU

25:32.833 --> 25:33.900
THE NUMBER
OF A DOCTOR, OKAY?

25:33.933 --> 25:36.467
HE'S AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST
THAT A LOT OF US SEE.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.867
THANKS.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.233
THIS IS
JUST SO INSANE,

25:40.267 --> 25:42.233
THE IDEA
THAT I'M NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

25:42.267 --> 25:43.533
SHE'S THE ONE

25:43.567 --> 25:45.133
WITH PATTERN OF LYING
AND CHEATING.

25:45.167 --> 25:47.200
SHE'S THE ONE WHO SWORE--
SHE SWORE--

25:47.233 --> 25:49.700
FROM THE DAY ANGELICA WAS BORN
THAT SHE WAS OUR CHILD.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.867
OUR CHILD,
UNEQUIVOCALLY,

25:51.900 --> 25:53.567
IRREVOCABLY OUR CHILD.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.800
AND THEN THE SECOND--

25:54.833 --> 25:56.100
THE SECOND
IT'S BECOMES INCONVENIENT--

25:56.133 --> 25:57.500
SHE STARTS SAYING,
"OH, IT'S MY DAUGHTER."

25:57.533 --> 25:59.667
SHE'S THE ONE WHO TRIED TO TAKE
HER AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:59.700 --> 26:00.967
OH, IN THE FIRST PLACE?

26:01.067 --> 26:02.167
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO WENT SCAMPERING BACK

26:02.200 --> 26:03.300
TO THE SAFETY
OF WHITE HETEROSEXUAL PRIVILEGE.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.567
SAFETY?

26:04.600 --> 26:05.967
THIS IS ABOUT
THE BRAVEST THING

26:06.067 --> 26:07.233
I'VE EVER DONE.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.567
I STAND TO LOSE
ALL MY FRIENDS,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.633
WHO VIEW ME AS
SOME SORT OF A TURNCOAT.

26:10.667 --> 26:11.867
NO ONE HATES YOU

26:11.900 --> 26:13.867
BECAUSE OF YOUR
SEXUAL ORIENTATION, TINA.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.333
THEY HATE YOU

26:15.367 --> 26:17.800
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED
NOT TO USE IT AGAINST ME

26:17.833 --> 26:19.933
WHEN IT COMES TO SHARING CUSTODY
OF OUR CHILD.

26:19.967 --> 26:22.467
OH, HERE WE GO
WITH THE TRUST THING AGAIN.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.700
THAT IS
SO FUCKING CRAZY.

26:23.733 --> 26:25.100
DON'T YOU DARE.

26:25.133 --> 26:26.667
OH, BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER
DO SUCH A THING?

26:26.700 --> 26:28.200
I'M SORRY, BUT WHO WAS IT
THAT KIDNAPPED OUR DAUGHTER

26:28.233 --> 26:29.400
AND DROVE OFF

26:29.433 --> 26:30.900
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

26:30.933 --> 26:32.067
COULD YOU MOVE, PLEASE?

26:32.067 --> 26:33.133
OKAY, OKAY,
WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE

26:33.167 --> 26:35.667
THAT YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.800
WHAT DECISION HAVE WE MADE?

26:36.833 --> 26:38.067
MOMMY DEAREST ONE

26:38.067 --> 26:39.433
AND MOMMY DEAREST TWO

26:39.467 --> 26:41.067
WILL BE FIGHTING THIS OUT
IN A COURT OF LAW.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.133
WHICH, IN THE END,
IS NOT A TERRIBLE THING.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.467
HOW IS THAT
NOT A TERRIBLE THING?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.233
YEAH, IN WHAT UNIVERSE
IS THAT NOT A TERRIBLE THING?

26:47.267 --> 26:48.367
WELL,
IN THE UNIVERSE

26:48.400 --> 26:49.967
OF MY BANK ACCOUNT,
FOR ONE,

26:50.067 --> 26:52.200
AND, LUCKILY FOR ME,
MY CLIENT IS EMPLOYED AGAIN.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.133
BUT THE REAL BEAUTY

26:54.167 --> 26:55.700
IS THAT THIS CASE

26:55.733 --> 26:57.633
WILL BE A MEDIA BONANZA.

26:57.667 --> 27:00.167
AND, TINA, IF I MAY STEP BACK
INTO MY ROLE

27:00.200 --> 27:01.433
AS MEDIATOR FOR RIGHT NOW,

27:01.467 --> 27:02.500
I SUGGEST YOU FIND
YOURSELF A BETTER LAWYER.

27:02.533 --> 27:03.867
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY LAWYER?

27:03.900 --> 27:05.200
WHY ARE YOU TELLING HER THIS?

27:05.233 --> 27:06.767
WELL, CHARLES
IS COMPETENT,

27:06.800 --> 27:08.067
BUT, FRANKLY,
HE'S A MILQUETOAST.

27:08.067 --> 27:09.267
I'LL HAVE HIM FOR BREAKFAST.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.233
OH, IT'S A SHAME
JOHNNIE COCHRAN'S DEAD.

27:12.267 --> 27:15.767
