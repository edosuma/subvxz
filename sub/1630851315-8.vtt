00:05.657 --> 00:08.225
The United States Navy
has a storied history

00:08.269 --> 00:10.619
with the Hawaiian people.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.056
Not without complications.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.059
Today marks a new chapter
in our shared history.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.714
A chapter of understanding
and cooperation

00:18.757 --> 00:21.673
as we return these sacred lands
to the Hawaiian people

00:21.717 --> 00:23.719
who have lived here
for generations.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.073
Mahalo and aloha.

00:30.117 --> 00:33.337
Hawaiian royalty once lived
upon these sacred lands.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.513
It is <i>pono,</i> or right,

00:35.557 --> 00:37.080
that it becomes
Hawaiian once more.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.908
We honor this land

00:38.951 --> 00:40.388
with a traditional blessing.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.011
May all life grow

00:55.055 --> 00:56.665
in these lands,

00:56.708 --> 00:59.189
the abundant lands

00:59.233 --> 01:01.278
of our natives.

01:01.322 --> 01:05.152
Please forgive
all of our wrongdoings

01:05.195 --> 01:09.025
and grant us all long life.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.747
All right.
Right.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.230
Trouble follows you everywhere,
Captain Milius.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.753
All I did was
give a speech.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.625
Admiral Wentworth got
called away last minute.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.149
I stepped in.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.934
Helping rebuild
community relations.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.284
Well, those relations
will have to wait a beat

01:50.327 --> 01:51.502
until I find out
what happened to the victim.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.591
Who's gonna tell them?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.203
That's definitely your purview.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.769
They're expecting us
to do the right thing,

01:57.813 --> 01:59.162
and we want to do
the right thing.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.903
So...
Make it fast.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.992
No surprises. Understood.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.126
I'm gonna miss this.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.268
What do we have?

02:18.312 --> 02:20.314
Victim is a Jane Doe.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.185
Estimating early-to-mid-20s.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.361
Bleeding.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.755
Contusions.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.757
Partial fracture
in the skull.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.150
She was bludgeoned.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.803
Forensics estimates
time of death

02:31.847 --> 02:33.283
around 11:00 last night.

02:33.327 --> 02:36.765
No ID. No phone.
No idea if she's military.

02:36.808 --> 02:40.203
But since the land still
technically belongs to the Navy,

02:40.247 --> 02:41.552
we take the lead on this.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.814
Hey, get
your hands off me.

02:42.858 --> 02:45.643
- This is our land.
It's okay.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.949
They're fine.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.522
We just want it back.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.045
<i>Eo.</i> That's still
the plan, okay?

02:56.088 --> 02:58.047
Okay, we have a situation.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.614
Oh, my God.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.704
You know her?

03:02.747 --> 03:05.446
Not by name, but she's one
of the <i>haole</i> protestors.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.361
Protesting what?
This land's being given back.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.407
Not here.
That land over there.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.235
Billionaire stole it.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.545
Tell us more
about the <i>haoles.</i>

03:17.588 --> 03:19.982
Our victim
is Kathy Laster.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.332
24 years old.
From Minnesota.

03:22.376 --> 03:26.118
Local ID'd the protest group
she came with, WorldWorks.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.251
Found photos of her
on their socials.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.035
Tell me
about WorldWorks.

03:30.079 --> 03:33.256
Eco-activist group dedicated
to "returning nature to nature."

03:33.300 --> 03:34.649
Mostly peaceful.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.433
Mostly?
Yeah, WorldWorks

03:36.477 --> 03:39.044
is suspected of setting fire
to some office buildings

03:39.088 --> 03:40.742
that encroached
on natural habitat.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.048
Can't argue with their spirit.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.790
- Spirit of arson?
- Protecting the land.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.705
We've always had to fight
to keep our land

03:47.749 --> 03:50.273
from Kalama Valley
to Mokauea

03:50.317 --> 03:51.622
since 1893.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.320
Hawaiians protecting their lands

03:53.363 --> 03:55.104
and disaffected college dropouts

03:55.147 --> 03:56.888
throwing Molotov cocktails

03:56.932 --> 03:58.107
are two very
different things.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.804
Why was Kathy Laster
in Hawai'i?

03:59.848 --> 04:01.937
Flight records

04:01.980 --> 04:03.808
show Kathy arrived
with her boyfriend,

04:03.852 --> 04:05.680
WorldWorks founder
Mike Williams,

04:05.723 --> 04:07.247
and these other members
last week.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.639
They were here
to protest the property

04:08.683 --> 04:09.988
next to the crime scene.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.687
Yeah, 95 acres

04:12.730 --> 04:14.428
bought by
Damian Davenport,

04:14.471 --> 04:16.517
the founder
of Nine Clouds,

04:16.560 --> 04:18.432
third largest server company
in the world.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.172
Bought the land
a couple years ago

04:20.216 --> 04:22.000
and has been
pissing off locals

04:22.044 --> 04:24.089
with his construction
ever since.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.614
WorldWorks staged
multiple protests this week

04:26.657 --> 04:28.268
demanding Davenport
return the land,

04:28.311 --> 04:29.747
which is a sacred site.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.748
In return,

04:30.792 --> 04:32.141
he bulldozed the <i>heiau</i>

04:32.184 --> 04:33.795
and replaced it
with a rose garden.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.667
Damian is just another rich guy
putting up walls.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.191
It's the same story,
different jackass.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.150
Did your family's land
get taken?

04:41.193 --> 04:42.717
No, but

04:42.760 --> 04:45.459
we all feel the pain
of Hawai'i getting carved up.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.982
It's about <i>Aloha 'Aina,</i>

04:47.025 --> 04:49.463
a-a deep love and respect
for the land.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.292
Where are the WorldWorks
protesters now?

04:52.335 --> 04:54.381
They've been in campsites
all over the area.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.599
Keep moving around.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.732
In other words, we don't know.

04:57.775 --> 05:01.039
Keep on it. Kai, come
with me to the M.E.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.306
May she come to eternal rest
from samsara

05:06.349 --> 05:08.351
and reach nirvana.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.006
May she come to eternal rest
from samsara

05:11.049 --> 05:12.877
and reach nirvana.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.618
We interrupting?

05:14.662 --> 05:16.359
Just the Buddhist prayer
for the dead.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361
I can carry on later.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.581
Ah, Tennant.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.453
Haven't seen you in my neck
of the woods for a hot minute.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.368
Ms. Laster an
important victim?

05:25.412 --> 05:26.891
They're all important victims,
Commander Chase.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.719
Mm, truth.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.373
You happen to know
what killed her?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.244
Rock.

05:32.288 --> 05:35.117
More effective than paper,
more unwieldy than scissors.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.773
Impact from the rock
fractured the cranium,

05:38.816 --> 05:40.296
led to internal
bleeding.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.950
Died within 15 minutes,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.866
but they were
a harrowing 15 minutes.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.476
Why harrowing?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.348
Epidermal shedding
on the hands and knees

05:48.391 --> 05:50.045
suggest she dragged herself

05:50.088 --> 05:52.395
to her final resting place.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.570
She was on the run.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.877
Gaia giveth and taketh away.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.315
She used the natural environment
to escape her killer,

05:59.359 --> 06:00.664
but died anyway.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.538
Gaia giveth any other evidence?

06:04.581 --> 06:07.279
Pollen in the nasal passages.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.413
You able to identify it?

06:10.457 --> 06:11.980
<i>Rosa damascena.</i>

06:12.023 --> 06:15.113
Damask rose. My grandmother
grew those back home.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.768
Common on the mainland.
Rare in Hawai'i.

06:17.812 --> 06:21.337
Damian Davenport has a
rose garden on his property.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.426
Think he knows anything
about Kathy Laster?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.733
Time to find out.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.270
They should call it
"One Cloud" then.

06:41.313 --> 06:44.273
Why so antsy?

06:44.316 --> 06:46.797
I don't like the
waiting room treatment.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.800
Ooh, wealthy people
always make you wait.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.149
It's a power move.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.456
- My badge is my power move.
- Mm-hmm.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.327
Don't think that's gonna help.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.199
Unless you
want to throw it

06:57.242 --> 06:59.070
at the wall of lawyers
Davenport'll have with him.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.769
You think he'll have
his lawyer with him?

07:01.812 --> 07:04.206
Lawyers. Plural.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.817
And yes.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.428
We're ready for you.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.869
We'll have this wrapped up
long before that.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.657
Mr. Davenport.
I'm Special...

07:20.701 --> 07:22.529
Special Agent Boone
and Special Agent Tara.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.834
Call me Damian.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.402
Okay, Damian,
we have a few questions.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.012
Can we speak
to you alone?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.840
Afraid not.
For efficiency's sake,

07:29.884 --> 07:31.451
I've brought everyone
you might want to speak with.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.583
My legal team and, uh,
Jake Tillman,

07:33.627 --> 07:36.194
head of security.
Your wife.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.416
So, there was trouble on
the property adjacent to mine.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.896
Someone died.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.899
Yes. Jake
told me about it.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.727
It's a shame.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.338
As you can imagine,
Damian has a rigorous schedule,

07:49.381 --> 07:50.426
but we've budgeted

07:50.470 --> 07:51.732
a few minutes
to interface.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.864
Well, this is
a murder investigation,

07:53.908 --> 07:56.258
so we'll take
as much time as we need.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.173
Where were you last night
at 11:00 p.m.?

07:58.216 --> 08:00.088
At home, with my wife.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.133
We're lights out
at 10:00 every night.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.527
The woman
who was killed,

08:04.571 --> 08:07.399
Kathy Laster,

08:07.443 --> 08:09.271
you know anything
about her?

08:09.314 --> 08:11.752
- Not a thing.
She's part of
an organization called

08:11.795 --> 08:14.276
WorldWorks,
been protesting outside

08:14.319 --> 08:16.408
your compound for a week.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.149
It's a large property.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.238
Well, we believe

08:20.282 --> 08:22.414
she was killed on that property.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.460
I understand that.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.462
And how do you feel
about the fact that a woman

08:26.506 --> 08:28.769
was most likely bludgeoned
to death on your land?

08:28.812 --> 08:30.901
How Damian feels
is immaterial.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.468
What Damian knows, however...

08:32.512 --> 08:34.688
I don't know what happened,

08:34.731 --> 08:36.167
but, uh...

08:36.211 --> 08:38.387
I am sorry
for the inconvenience.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.128
Inconvenience?

08:40.171 --> 08:42.870
WorldWorks is an extremist group

08:42.913 --> 08:45.394
with violent
and unpredictable members.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.309
They've had multiple run-ins
with law enforcement.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.658
Why don't you speak with them?

08:48.702 --> 08:50.617
'Cause we're speaking
with you now.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.402
My team has done a full work-up
of the organization.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.491
I'm happy to share our findings.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.580
Mrs. Davenport,
do you recognize

08:57.624 --> 08:59.974
- Ms. Laster?
- She does not.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.585
- Mrs. Davenport.
- That is our time.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.891
Make more.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.588
NCIS has our
full cooperation here.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.112
Um, my legal team and Jake
are here to help you

09:08.156 --> 09:09.592
with anything else
you might need.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.159
Uh, if you need
to speak with me again,

09:11.202 --> 09:13.335
please liaise through my office.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.555
Thank you.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.037
Rich people.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.871
Captain Milius.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.351
Little early for one of your
patented pep talks.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.093
I'm not here
about the case.
Refreshing.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.706
I thought by not asking
you might volunteer something.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.229
Eco-activists are in the wind,

09:38.273 --> 09:40.101
and a billionaire's
stonewalling us.

09:41.363 --> 09:44.322
To be honest, I wanted to talk
to you about something else.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.629
Would it be the fact
that you're being transferred?

09:46.673 --> 09:47.761
Yeah.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.371
How'd you know?

09:49.414 --> 09:51.286
You said you'd miss me,
so I did some digging.

09:51.329 --> 09:54.332
Opportunity came up
at the Pentagon.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.812
That's the one
with the five sides.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.335
Couldn't say no.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.467
Well, you must be excited.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.644
I am, and, uh...

10:01.688 --> 10:05.474
I just wanted to say...

10:05.517 --> 10:06.997
I've enjoyed working with you.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.826
The feeling's mutual.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.922
Okay, well, go solve a murder.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.142
You free for dinner?

10:24.362 --> 10:27.061
To celebrate your transfer,
of course.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.802
And the optics?

10:28.845 --> 10:30.717
It's no longer an issue.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.068
Yes, of course.

10:34.111 --> 10:37.767
Um... Dinner.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.682
I'll call you.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.423
Yeah.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.993
PacFleet breathing
down your neck?

10:46.036 --> 10:48.560
The worst, huh?
What'd you learn?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.432
WorldWorks just popped up
on the radar.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.868
HPD got a complaint

10:51.912 --> 10:53.653
about the activists
at Davenport's compound.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.784
Another protest?

10:54.828 --> 10:56.133
It's more like a breach.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.439
They rammed the gate.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.796
Where is everyone?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.624
HPD said they saw some people
running from the area.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.973
Lost them
in the woods.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.454
Not all of them.

11:12.497 --> 11:15.936
What're you doing? Let me go!

11:15.979 --> 11:19.504
Get your hands off me, man!

11:22.725 --> 11:25.293
Federal agents!

11:42.397 --> 11:43.398
Gun.

11:43.441 --> 11:46.096
Registered and permitted.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.795
What's going on here?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.840
We responded to a disturbance
on the east gate

11:50.884 --> 11:52.581
and found trespassers
breaking in.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.191
The others fled. I caught
this one on the property,

11:54.235 --> 11:56.977
and I was forced
to restrain him.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.762
Doesn't explain the "tied
to a torture chair" situation.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
- Or the head wound.
- He beat me like the gestapo.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.810
He hurt himself
trying to run,

12:03.853 --> 12:06.464
and I was wearing the gloves to
protect myself from infection.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.118
He's a liar and a thug.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.467
You're a trespasser
and a vandal.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.121
I want to press charges.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.254
Let me get you checked out,
and we'll take your statement.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.517
Can we speak privately?

12:17.824 --> 12:19.260
- Yeah.
- We'll clean you up.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.352
I'm in the security business,
Special Agent.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.571
It's my job is to assess risk
and resolve conflict

12:26.615 --> 12:28.791
in order to protect
Damian and his family.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.141
Your job was to call
law enforcement.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.317
I'm the one
who alerted HPD.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.015
Listen, that man in there,
Mike Williams,

12:35.058 --> 12:37.365
has a history of violence,
a vendetta against Damian,

12:37.408 --> 12:39.367
and has been known
to turn on his colleagues.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.456
Are you suggesting
he had something to do

12:41.499 --> 12:42.805
with Kathy Laster's death?

12:42.849 --> 12:45.329
I know they were
intimately involved,

12:45.373 --> 12:47.288
and his arrest record
includes assault.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.248
- You've seen his arrest record?
- That's what I do.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.556
Gather data and draw
the most logical conclusions.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.819
Well, the most logical
conclusion to me

12:56.863 --> 12:57.907
is that your boss

12:57.951 --> 12:59.691
doesn't want
WorldWorks around.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.345
Where were you
last night?

13:01.389 --> 13:04.218
20,000 feet above the Pacific
on a company plane.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.307
I was in San Diego on business.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.309
- You can verify that?
- Of course.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.572
I'll get the manifest.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.313
I'm here to help.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.359
I used to work for the FBI.
Cybersecurity.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.839
I can be a resource.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.886
Yeah, next time
you want to help,

13:19.929 --> 13:21.626
don't.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.198
Tillman might be a weasel,
but his alibi checks out.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.852
Manifest from
the corporate jet

13:29.896 --> 13:31.636
has him arriving into Oahu
after Kathy's murder.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.682
And his
intel's thorough.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.945
Dossiers on every member
of WorldWorks.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.208
- Including Mike Williams?
Yeah.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.168
Mike comes as advertised.
Set fire to a police car

13:41.211 --> 13:44.040
while protesting
a pipeline in North Dakota.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.173
Tried to tar and feather the CEO

13:46.216 --> 13:47.957
of an energy company in Arizona.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.350
Mike's willing
to resort to violence

13:49.393 --> 13:51.134
to get what he wants.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.919
Yeah, I mean, he's one
of these "true believers,"

13:52.962 --> 13:55.573
willing to do anything for
the cause, legal or otherwise.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.619
He's overly passionate
about the cause.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.056
- Yeah.
- Come on. Overly passionate?

14:00.100 --> 14:02.058
Look, people like
Damian Davenport

14:02.102 --> 14:05.540
have been taking advantage of
Hawai'i for its entire history.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.759
It's not hard to understand
Mike's anger.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.327
He's the son of an
investment banker from Chicago.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.894
This isn't
his fight.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.635
Yeah, well,
it wasn't Kathy's either,

14:13.678 --> 14:15.071
and she turned up dead.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.291
Let's see if Mike Williams

14:17.334 --> 14:19.641
can shine some light on this.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.906
How much did he pay you?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.605
Damian Davenport?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.477
I mean, that's the reason
I'm here, and he's free.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.783
You're not under arrest,

14:31.827 --> 14:33.394
and I'm not on the take.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.571
You work
for the federal government.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.355
You're all on the take.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.053
I mean, men like Damian,
they own you,

14:40.096 --> 14:41.663
then use their
blood money

14:41.706 --> 14:43.317
to steal local lands
all over the world.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.015
You don't have to explain
the concept to me.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.975
Let's talk
about Kathy Laster.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.107
I'm not telling you
where any of my people are.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.022
We know where Kathy is.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.636
When's the last time
you saw her?

15:01.204 --> 15:03.424
Two days ago

15:03.467 --> 15:05.295
at the campsite,

15:05.339 --> 15:07.819
but Kathy had nothing to do
with today's action, all right?

15:07.863 --> 15:09.604
- She skipped out on us.
- You got into a fight?

15:09.647 --> 15:11.998
Why's that any of your business?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.304
You two were dating, right?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.741
Maybe business
and personal

15:16.785 --> 15:19.483
didn't mix well?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.224
Kathy and I have a...

15:21.268 --> 15:24.010
shared passion for the cause.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.838
She's the one who pushed us to
fly out here and take a stand,

15:26.882 --> 15:29.232
but she lost
her nerve.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.496
She wanted to go home,
then we argued, she disappeared.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.889
And then what happened?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.586
And then?

15:35.630 --> 15:38.111
We tried to storm the Bastille.
Now I'm here.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.027
- What happened with Kathy?
- I don't know.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.985
But, clearly, you do. You...

15:43.029 --> 15:44.378
You said you know where she is.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.076
What does that mean?

15:48.860 --> 15:50.427
Is Kathy okay?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.910
Is Kathy okay?

16:01.873 --> 16:03.397
I don't see murder.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.791
Despite his history,
Mike seemed genuinely torn up

16:06.835 --> 16:08.663
last night
over Kathy's death.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.274
Could be shock. Could be guilt.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.667
He claims
he was moving camp

16:12.710 --> 16:14.147
with the WorldWorks
group the night

16:14.190 --> 16:15.887
in question, but we can't
find them to confirm it.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.498
Still an island.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.369
Have to come up for air
at some point.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.936
WorldWorks is a distraction.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.286
Damian Davenport
is the center of this.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.766
So what?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.202
WorldWorks shows up
to his home, he gets upset,

16:26.246 --> 16:27.812
and then beats one
of them to death?

16:27.856 --> 16:29.727
People like Damian
don't get their hands dirty.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.425
Not over protests, at least.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.122
We can't eliminate suspects yet.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.081
We need
to dig deeper.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.865
The one thing we know
for sure is that Kathy

16:36.908 --> 16:39.302
brought the group to Hawai'i
and then changed her mind.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.825
Why?

16:40.869 --> 16:43.219
Because she was paid to.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.916
Not to change
her mind--

16:44.960 --> 16:46.744
you can't change people, they
can only change themselves--

16:46.788 --> 16:48.398
but to fly here.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.662
Kathy had an anonymous donor
to fund this trip to Hawai'i.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.273
How anonymous?

16:53.316 --> 16:56.102
From a Dubai shell company
to a Seychelles tax haven

16:56.145 --> 16:58.017
and all the way

16:58.060 --> 16:59.975
to a credit union
in sunny Boca Raton.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.107
Who sent the money?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.630
Take a look.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.417
Morgan Davenport. Damian's wife.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.992
Morgan's a well-known
philanthropist.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.429
Gives millions
to charity.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.170
Well, she could house
a lot of the homeless

17:21.214 --> 17:22.693
with the rent
she pays here.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.391
Appearances are everything
to the wealthy,

17:24.434 --> 17:26.349
even when it's not-for-profit.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.005
We should go in.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.442
And run into a wall
of assistants and lawyers?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.923
No. Let's wait
for her to come out.

17:36.533 --> 17:39.275
Why would Morgan finance
WorldWorks' trip here

17:39.319 --> 17:40.972
to protest her own home?

17:41.016 --> 17:43.758
She's been trying to get Damian
to sign The Giving Pledge,

17:43.801 --> 17:46.761
maybe it's a way
to put pressure on him.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.806
I might not understand
rich people,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.721
but I understandmotive.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.158
Morgan doesn't
have one.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.898
Not yet, at least.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.380
Let's see if we can find out.

18:01.341 --> 18:04.518
Mrs. Davenport, you mind
if we talk for a sec?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.694
Special Agents.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.522
Alan Shipley.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.524
I'm, uh...
The lawyer. Yeah.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.916
Mrs. Davenport's
unavailable.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.093
Please.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.312
But I'm authorized
to answer any concerns

18:16.356 --> 18:18.140
and provide a timetable
as to her whereabouts

18:18.184 --> 18:19.620
the night in question.

18:19.663 --> 18:22.797
Yeah, we need to, uh,
speak to Morgan directly.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.539
I'd hate for this to be elevated
to the Nine Clouds' board.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.062
Could become a whole thing.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.587
You know our position.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.680
Elevated to
the board, huh?

18:36.724 --> 18:39.292
Scandal's the only thing
that scares them.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.859
Not enough, it seems.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.123
We need to get more
out of these people.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.388
You see that,
across the street?

18:48.431 --> 18:51.260
Gray Ford. Dude with a camera?

18:51.304 --> 18:53.828
Yeah, he's been
taking pictures of us.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.528
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

18:58.572 --> 19:01.662
Exercising my freedom of
expression to make that <i>kala.</i>

19:01.705 --> 19:03.316
Mm.
Who's paying you?

19:03.359 --> 19:05.100
Anyone and everyone.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.536
You a tabloid
photographer?

19:06.580 --> 19:08.843
I'm a freelance photographer.

19:08.886 --> 19:11.454
Island's best. Wilbert Kalili.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.456
What do you want
with Morgan Davenport?

19:13.500 --> 19:16.546
The money shot, baby.
Keep track of the big game.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.592
Always pays off. Like one hunter

19:18.635 --> 19:21.725
on the prowl.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.944
Pays off how?

19:22.987 --> 19:24.293
During the slow months,

19:24.337 --> 19:26.077
could find her
with the wrong people.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.905
Sell the juicy stuff
to the magazines.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.820
Or to Morgan herself?

19:29.864 --> 19:31.431
That's capitalism.

19:31.474 --> 19:34.608
That's actually blackmail,
and it's illegal.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.392
Just talking here, bruddah.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.699
How about you show us
what you got?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.570
Sure. I-If you want to pay.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.225
I give you
good price, jawline.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.749
How much you want?

19:45.793 --> 19:48.274
Depends.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.015
How much you got?

19:51.059 --> 19:53.279
Well, hopefully the photos
of Morgan pan out,

19:53.322 --> 19:55.672
and you got a receipt
from the photographer.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.937
- Keep me updated.
- I'm late.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.026
I had a 15-minute conference
call that went two hours.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.289
You're right on time.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.204
Uh, any movement on the case?

20:06.857 --> 20:09.208
Here's an idea, no work talk.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.995
Agreed.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.913
Thank you.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.960
Full disclosure, uh,

20:23.004 --> 20:25.789
I have not been out
for an evening in...

20:25.833 --> 20:27.182
a while.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.271
Full disclosure,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.447
I bet I have you beat.

20:31.491 --> 20:32.666
What's your poison?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.276
Cold beer?

20:34.320 --> 20:36.278
Tequila it is.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.019
Okay.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.368
Uh, two tequilas,please.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.196
- Yup. Right away.
- Thank you.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.506
So, we've been working together

20:46.549 --> 20:48.638
for a few months now,

20:48.682 --> 20:50.205
and I know nothing about you.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.600
Um...

20:53.643 --> 20:55.558
I'm from Michigan.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.081
My father owns a hardware store,

20:57.125 --> 20:58.605
and my sister
is an Episcopal priest.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.737
We'll get back to that.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.653
But first, tell me
something about you

21:03.697 --> 21:05.612
that I would never guess
in a million years.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.876
I was in a ska band in college.

21:08.919 --> 21:12.009
Played bass.
We were popular.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.185
We toured the Midwest,

21:14.229 --> 21:16.318
but, um...

21:16.362 --> 21:17.798
the pressure of fame
got too much.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.190
The band broke up,
and I joined the Navy.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.409
Are you kidding?

21:20.453 --> 21:21.932
Yes.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.674
Of course you are. Thank you.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.328
I did play bass,
though, in college.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.851
Really?
For the jazz band.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.985
Oh, well, that
makes more sense.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.335
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.167
Okay.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.734
- All right.
- All of it.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.738
Yes.
How jazz band was that?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.701
Spam musubi.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.225
Oh, can't.
Intermittent fasting.

21:54.269 --> 21:57.751
Not eating between 8:00 p.m.
and 12:00 p.m.

22:01.145 --> 22:03.060
I'll make
an exception.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.976
Mmm.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.328
Eating is
so underrated.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.765
So, you get more insight
into why Morgan Davenport

22:11.808 --> 22:13.636
financed Kathy's
trip here?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.464
Well, since Kathy's phone
is still M.I.A.,

22:15.508 --> 22:16.944
I can't get into
her messages.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.380
What about Morgan's?

22:18.424 --> 22:20.774
Well, A] we don't have
a warrant, and B]

22:20.817 --> 22:23.254
anything public

22:23.298 --> 22:25.213
is curated by her husband
and his company.

22:25.256 --> 22:26.301
So, we're nowhere.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.998
Mm, didn't say that

22:28.042 --> 22:29.478
because the unofficial
chatter online

22:29.522 --> 22:31.350
is very spicy.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.659
Dedicated to Damian's
extracurricular activity.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.227
Spoiler alert,
he likes women.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.620
Particularly if
they're not his wife.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.839
And you think
Kathy Laster was one?

22:42.883 --> 22:45.146
Well, I think where there's
a dog, there's fleas.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.191
Inoki excluded of course.

22:47.235 --> 22:50.412
It's a shame if her death
comes down to a jealous spouse.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.110
Well, you'd prefer
a more noble motive?

22:53.154 --> 22:55.983
She died trying
to get the land back.

22:56.026 --> 22:59.856
<i>Aloha 'Aina.</i> Her memory
shouldn't boil down to adultery.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.906
That was nice.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.734
It was.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.431
Shame you're leaving.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.781
I could get used
to fun Captain Milius.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.349
I could put in papers.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.046
Get back in the
music business?

23:16.090 --> 23:19.659
I think I got my bass
somewhere in storage.

23:19.702 --> 23:20.790
So...

23:20.834 --> 23:22.792
I just wanted to say...

23:28.232 --> 23:30.104
That was nice, too.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.367
I was hoping
for better than nice.

23:38.460 --> 23:41.115
Your kids?
With their dad.

24:01.048 --> 24:04.530
Ah. You want some milk
with your coffee?

24:04.573 --> 24:07.707
I don't even know--

24:07.750 --> 24:09.448
Hey, there.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.058
Hey.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.886
I'm-I'm-I'm Captain--

24:12.929 --> 24:14.453
I'm Joe. Your mom's...

24:14.496 --> 24:15.976
Friend?
Yes.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.847
And you must be...

24:17.891 --> 24:19.806
Alex.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.982
My-my mom's son.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.377
I-I need my glove.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.118
You like baseball?

24:28.162 --> 24:32.035
Yeah. I-I-I do... Joe.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.082
We have almond milk if you
want to put that-- Alex.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.258
Didn't expect you.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.129
Clearly.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.480
This is...

24:41.523 --> 24:43.786
Joe. Yeah, we met.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.050
Do you want breakfast?

24:47.094 --> 24:50.445
I got practice,
but thanks. Um...

24:50.489 --> 24:52.229
Good to
meet you, Joe.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.674
Alex, listen.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.066
There's literally nothing
that you could say

25:03.110 --> 25:04.851
to make this
less awkward right now.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.114
Can we talk later?

25:07.157 --> 25:08.681
Good plan.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.730
So, uh,
that happened.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.866
Sorry. Got to go to work.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.006
You all right, boss?

25:30.050 --> 25:32.922
Yeah. Kid stuff.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.576
What do we have?

25:34.620 --> 25:37.144
This is a
month's worth of

25:37.187 --> 25:39.625
Morgan Davenport photos
from Mr. TMZ.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.365
Yeah, it cost me
a month's salary, too.

25:41.409 --> 25:44.194
Got her at the beach,
events, yoga.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.153
What we don't have are photos
of her with Damian.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.850
Husband and wife
living separate lives?

25:47.894 --> 25:49.504
Could be two busy
professionals.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.072
Or signs of trouble
in paradise.

25:52.115 --> 25:55.597
We may not have Damian, but
we definitely have Kathy Laster.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.164
They met.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.383
And they weren't
getting along.

25:59.427 --> 26:03.170
Morgan flew her and her protest
group here for a confrontation?

26:03.213 --> 26:06.652
We only know what we know.
They met. Bring Morgan in.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.610
She'll try
to stonewall us.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.438
Tell her lawyer about
the photos. She'll come.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.962
Anything to
avoid a scandal.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.619
Morgan Davenport.
I believe there's been

26:17.663 --> 26:19.926
some miscommunication
between our offices.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.232
If that's how you'd like
to characterize it.

26:26.497 --> 26:29.283
How would you describe your
relationship with WorldWorks?

26:29.326 --> 26:31.720
Morgan has no relationship
with that organization.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.417
The fact that she
secretly funded

26:33.461 --> 26:34.984
their trip to Hawai'i
says otherwise.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
Where are you getting
your information?

26:36.682 --> 26:39.641
Financial records.
All legally obtained.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.165
We thought it was because Morgan
wanted to put pressure on Damian

26:42.209 --> 26:43.297
- to return the land.
- I do want that...

26:43.340 --> 26:45.473
Morgan, please.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.867
But now we know it's because
you have a more personal reason

26:47.910 --> 26:49.999
to pressure
your husband.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.616
This is you coming out of

26:57.659 --> 26:59.139
the Leach and Dunne
family law practice.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.749
Divorce lawyers.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.795
You've been following her?

27:02.838 --> 27:04.013
Alan, it'll come out eventually.

27:06.233 --> 27:09.628
Yes, Damian and I
are separating.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.107
We have fundamental
disagreements

27:11.151 --> 27:13.675
on some ethical issues
in his business.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.547
Ethical issues
in other places, too.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.854
You didn't bring Kathy
out here to protest.

27:18.898 --> 27:22.162
You brought her out here
for a confrontation.

27:22.205 --> 27:25.121
This was taken
the day before she died.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.732
Why were you fighting?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.342
It's complicated.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.865
I need a moment
- with my client.
- Un-complicate it.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.693
Damian and Kathy

27:31.737 --> 27:33.564
- had a special relationship.
- You're not listening to me.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.828
- Special how?
- This isn't what Damian wants.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.525
Morgan.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.792
We can speak if you want to.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.276
He's right.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.627
Damian won't approve,
and it is not my place to say.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.412
My husband
is a flawed man,

27:55.456 --> 27:57.240
always was.

27:59.286 --> 28:02.158
When we were young, in Duluth,

28:02.202 --> 28:05.684
I thought success
would help smooth the edges.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.819
But some things never change.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.789
<i>Morgan Davenport wanted to talk.</i>

28:23.832 --> 28:25.704
Guilty conscience?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.531
Or is she trying to point
the finger someplace else?

28:27.575 --> 28:29.882
Never got far enough
to figure it out.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.361
She did mention
that Damian

28:31.405 --> 28:33.276
and Kathy Laster had
a special relationship.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.757
Suggests an affair.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.977
Could explain why
Morgan brought her in.

28:38.020 --> 28:41.328
Leverage for the divorce.
Affair means bad PR for Damian.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.157
I mean, a murder would
mean bad PR, too.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.462
Duluth.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.899
Morgan couldn't talk freely,

28:46.942 --> 28:48.596
but she was trying
to tell me something.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.164
She mentioned when she
and Damian were young in Duluth.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.383
Damian and Morgan

28:53.427 --> 28:55.603
met and married in Minneapolis.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.257
They never lived in Duluth,

28:57.300 --> 28:59.607
and there's no connection
to Nine Clouds there either.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.174
But Kathy spent

29:01.217 --> 29:04.568
a lot of time there.
It's all over her socials.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.831
Says it's her "happy place."

29:05.874 --> 29:07.833
That place would
make me happy, too.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.269
Does Kathy come from money?

29:09.312 --> 29:12.533
Uh, mother is
a freelance bookkeeper,

29:12.576 --> 29:14.578
and the house
belongs to a trust.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.277
A way to keep
ownership discreet.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.061
So, it's hush money.

29:19.105 --> 29:22.282
Damian bought Kathy the house to
keep her quiet about the affair.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.632
Mm. Wrong tree,

29:24.675 --> 29:26.286
but right orchard.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.029
Need to get Damian
away from his lawyers.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.118
Any ideas?

29:32.161 --> 29:35.556
Hawaiian common law can help.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.306
You're on
private property.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.091
Actually, you're on private
property. I'm on the beach,

29:49.135 --> 29:52.791
which in Hawai'i
is public.

29:52.834 --> 29:56.795
You know, I get exactly
one hour a day to myself,

29:56.838 --> 29:59.580
and since you won't leave me
or my wife alone...

29:59.623 --> 30:03.018
Let's get this over with.
Come on, take your best shot.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.542
Oh, I'm not here to talk about
you or your wife.

30:05.586 --> 30:06.935
I'm here to talk about
your daughter.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.548
Kathy Laster.

30:18.555 --> 30:19.992
Let me tell you
a story.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.168
Stop me if I
get it wrong.

30:22.211 --> 30:25.214
25 years ago, you founded
Nine Clouds in Minneapolis.

30:25.258 --> 30:28.565
Everyone who worked for you got
rich, except your bookkeeper,

30:28.609 --> 30:30.176
Sarah Laster.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.568
She left the company,

30:31.612 --> 30:33.222
gave birth to a baby girl
six months later.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.224
Kathy Laster
was your daughter.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.487
You bought the house
to keep her mother quiet,

30:37.531 --> 30:38.880
and it worked.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.013
Until your wife found out.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.623
Flew Kathy here.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.539
That's all you got?

30:45.582 --> 30:47.062
That's all I need.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.455
What happened to Kathy?

30:49.760 --> 30:51.284
I didn't kill that woman.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.720
Your daughter.

30:53.721 --> 30:56.245
Look, I made some mistakes
in my life.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.639
Sarah was one of them.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.729
I offered compensation
to protect my marriage

31:01.772 --> 31:03.426
and Sarah.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.993
The scandals
would've hurt her, too.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.560
What about protecting Kathy?

31:07.953 --> 31:10.651
- She's not my responsibility.
- You really believe that?

31:10.694 --> 31:12.827
You know what? There-There's
no proof of anything.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.135
There's proof she was murdered
on your property.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.485
She ran for help
until she bled to death.

31:18.528 --> 31:19.921
Now, if you didn't do it,

31:19.965 --> 31:21.967
don't you want
to know who did?

31:23.664 --> 31:26.275
It's a tragedy.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.538
I trust you'll find the killer.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.714
I also trust you'll leave
these damaging rumors

31:30.758 --> 31:32.673
out of the investigation.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.381
<i>Tennant had no luck
breaking Damian, huh?</i>

31:45.425 --> 31:47.601
Admitted to buying the house
for Kathy's mom,

31:47.644 --> 31:49.385
but wouldn't cop
to being the father.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.865
Got a lot on the line.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.128
Billionaire divorces
tend to affect stock prices.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.738
Nine Clouds
could suffer.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.566
There'd need to be proof
that Kathy's his daughter.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.481
No way he'd take
a paternity test.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.483
Morgan could've collected
a sample secretly,

32:00.527 --> 32:02.398
had the test run herself.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.747
And shared
- it with Kathy.
- Oh.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.010
I was just looking for you.

32:05.053 --> 32:05.924
Any luck locating
Kathy's phone?

32:05.967 --> 32:06.837
Well, first of all,

32:06.881 --> 32:08.448
luck is a human construct

32:08.491 --> 32:10.189
designed to give meaning
to random acts of chance,

32:10.232 --> 32:13.366
and in turn, comfort us
in a universe that is

32:13.409 --> 32:14.802
inherently chaotic.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.717
And Kathy's phone?

32:16.760 --> 32:19.111
Well, that's why I was looking
for you. It was just turned on.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.026
- You know where?
- Campground on the west side.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.462
I'll send you the details.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.203
Lucky break, huh?

32:29.512 --> 32:32.298
Kathy's phone led us
to the WorldWorks campsite.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.256
Protesters responded
with force,

32:34.300 --> 32:36.650
so, HPD rounded them up
and brought them in.

32:36.693 --> 32:39.696
This is Mike Williams
and Kathy Laster's.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.916
Found her phone and
personal effects in his tent.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.440
Mike explain why he had
his girlfriend's phone?

32:44.484 --> 32:46.225
Mike wasn't there.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.575
And the WorldWorks members
claim not to know where he is.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.099
Think they're
- telling the truth?
- I got 'em

32:51.143 --> 32:52.753
in the conference room.
I'm gonna find out.

32:52.796 --> 32:53.797
And the phone?

32:53.841 --> 32:54.973
It's locked.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.409
Ernie's doing
his thing.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.498
All right, well,
we'll search this stuff.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.810
So... oil money, huh?

33:07.811 --> 33:09.683
Did you research me?

33:09.726 --> 33:12.903
I'm sorry. It's a cop habit.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.604
Yeah, my family's done well.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.954
What? You just like
to keep it a secret?

33:19.998 --> 33:23.262
People look at you differently
when they think you're wealthy.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.481
Money complicates things.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.744
I think that's something
only rich people say.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.792
My parents used money
to control us,

33:31.835 --> 33:34.534
tell us what to do, who to be.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.536
I didn't like that.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.973
Well, they must have loved
you going into law enforcement.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.844
They did not.

33:40.888 --> 33:43.630
Whoa.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.287
Nine millimeter rounds.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.289
But no gun.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.725
Mike is armed.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.553
And in the wind.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.686
Please tell me you were able
to crack Kathy's phone.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.733
Wasn't the top recruit out of
Caltech 'cause of my good looks.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.257
Well, that may have been
a factor. All right.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.781
20 emails back and forth
from an unknown sender.

34:04.825 --> 34:05.869
All about the trip to Hawai'i.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.784
Probably Morgan.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.917
Yes, but only one message

34:09.960 --> 34:11.614
with an attachment.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.269
A DNA test proving

34:14.313 --> 34:16.097
Kathy and Damian are related.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.881
Morgan knew.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.014
She must have planned to use
this as leverage over Damian.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.494
She's not the only one.

34:21.537 --> 34:23.322
Mike Williams got
into the phone,

34:23.365 --> 34:24.888
forwarded the
message to himself.

34:24.932 --> 34:26.586
Mike knows
Kathy is Damian's daughter.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.675
And he's out there
with a gun.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.635
I'm telling you,
I'm not just going

34:32.679 --> 34:34.072
to let you
onto the property.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.551
And I'm telling you,

34:35.595 --> 34:37.031
a potentially dangerous man
is already on it.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.554
The compound is secure.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.426
WorldWorks has been
here multiple times.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.645
You don't think Mike knows
your vulnerabilities?

34:42.689 --> 34:44.343
No warrant, no access.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.996
We're trying to avoid
something terrible happening.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.043
I have a full security staff
trained to do just that.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.914
Mr. Tillman,
there isn't much...

34:52.351 --> 34:54.353
- What the hell was that?
- Probable cause.

34:54.396 --> 34:55.702
We're entering the compound now.

34:55.745 --> 34:58.226
You check the fire,
we'll check the house.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.317
Fire's out
of control.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.927
Any sign of Mike Williams?

35:03.971 --> 35:05.146
He wouldn't have survived this.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.409
Doesn't matter.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.063
Damian's never here
at this hour.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.543
Just property damage.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.111
It's a distraction.

35:36.525 --> 35:39.659
Mr. and Mrs. Davenport,
you okay?

35:39.702 --> 35:41.965
No, they're not.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.752
Mike, need you
to put the weapon down.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.493
After he admits what he did.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.148
There's nothing
to admit.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.236
Kathy was your daughter,

35:51.279 --> 35:52.672
and you used her as a pawn.

35:52.715 --> 35:56.066
- It's not true.
- Stop lying!

35:56.110 --> 35:57.633
Hey, guys, got a series

35:57.677 --> 35:59.331
of encrypted messages
from Kathy's phone.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.028
Not the best time to chat.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.030
Someone reached out to her
the night she died.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.945
Encryption is next level.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.034
Not even sure
I can crack it, but...

36:07.077 --> 36:08.862
You did this!...I have an idea
of who'd be capable of this.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.298
In the middle of something
important here.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.821
Me, too. I'm breaking the case,

36:11.865 --> 36:13.214
finding the killer.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.260
We might have another one
on our hands.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.262
Mike Williams is about
to shoot Damian.

36:17.305 --> 36:20.395
Okay, okay. Your thing wins.
I'll keep working.

36:20.439 --> 36:21.788
Hey, Mike,

36:21.831 --> 36:23.398
this isn't the way, okay?

36:23.442 --> 36:25.661
The truth. Now!

36:25.705 --> 36:27.054
You killed Kathy!

36:27.097 --> 36:30.623
I had no reason
to kill that woman.

36:30.666 --> 36:33.278
Morgan brought her in
as leverage for the divorce,

36:33.321 --> 36:35.018
or to shame me.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.933
I-I... I met with her.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.849
She said I was her father,
had DNA to prove it.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.852
I offered to pay her to leave,
and-and... and she refused.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.072
- And then you beat her to death.
- No.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.857
I called my lawyers. I told them
we had a problem on our hands.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.164
But she was your daughter,
not a problem!

36:50.208 --> 36:51.209
Hey, think of Kathy here.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.688
I'm doing this for her.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.560
- No. You're doing
this for you.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.866
She wouldn't want you
to spend your life in jail.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.868
All because of him?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.528
Put the gun down, Tillman, now!

37:06.572 --> 37:09.139
I got him, Damian.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.924
You're safe now.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.411
Gonna apply pressure, okay?

37:20.412 --> 37:22.283
We need an ambulance.
Code 3.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.937
Stay with me, Mike.
Stay with me.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.373
You got it.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.297
I'm assuming Damian and Morgan
are free to go, correct?

37:36.341 --> 37:39.866
They are. You, however,
need to come with me.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.737
I've given my statement.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.739
I was justified
in shooting an armed intruder,

37:43.783 --> 37:45.872
and helping
to catch Kathy Laster's killer.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.395
You're half right.

37:48.396 --> 37:50.529
Mike Williams
didn't murder Kathy.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.923
You're not still suggesting
that Damian was involved.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.404
My people found messages
on Kathy's phone

37:56.448 --> 37:58.058
with intelligence-level
encryption.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.582
It took a minute to
decode them, but we did it.

38:00.626 --> 38:02.497
They're from you...

38:02.541 --> 38:05.195
inviting Kathy to meet you on
the grounds the night she died.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.588
I wasn't even
on the island that night.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.068
I was on the company jet.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.809
Or at least said you were.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.245
Check the manifest.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.595
This one?

38:13.639 --> 38:15.293
The real manifest?

38:16.511 --> 38:19.862
The one you showed
us was doctored.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.473
Why would I do any of this?

38:21.516 --> 38:24.737
You've been hiding Damian's
dirty laundry for years.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.652
And you knew an
illegitimate daughter

38:26.695 --> 38:28.088
would open
the floodgates.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.568
I would never kill anyone.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.744
You probably offered her money
at first.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.746
But Kathy couldn't be bought.

38:33.789 --> 38:37.576
So you panicked, took the
situation into your own hands.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.578
You've worked for Damian
for a decade.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.275
This is your one chance
to explain to him

38:41.319 --> 38:43.408
why you killed his daughter.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.026
I want to speak to a lawyer.

38:53.069 --> 38:55.637
I'm sure that
can be arranged.

39:02.644 --> 39:07.127
The recent tragic events
have opened all of our eyes.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.870
And in dedication
to Kathy Laster,

39:10.913 --> 39:13.525
my daughter,

39:13.568 --> 39:15.918
and her work as
an activist...

39:15.962 --> 39:17.920
...we are offering our land

39:17.964 --> 39:20.749
to the people of Hawai'i.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.188
Dude doesn't believe
a word he's saying.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.800
He went through all that,
and didn't change one bit.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.932
Public perception
of him will.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.978
He's got the divorce,
the murdered daughter.

39:32.021 --> 39:34.110
God knows how many other affairs
that'll be outed.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.112
The board'll force him
to resign.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.114
He's trying to get
in front of the train

39:38.158 --> 39:39.681
before it runs him down.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.422
Not sure that's how trains work,

39:41.466 --> 39:43.468
but I get your point.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.121
Morgan's done, too.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.472
The philanthropy world's
not gonna respond well

39:47.515 --> 39:49.038
to what she did.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.737
Look, land's going back
to where it belongs.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.608
Tillman's gonna get 25-to-life.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.349
Mike Williams is gonna survive.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.047
It's not fair,
but it's justice.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.049
It's something.

40:04.010 --> 40:07.317
So, how rich
is your family?

40:07.361 --> 40:10.277
I could tell you, but
it'd only make things weird.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.540
Well, we love you no matter
how much dough you have.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.370
