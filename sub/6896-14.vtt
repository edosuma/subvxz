WEBVTT

00:19.353 --> 00:20.436
Ezra, I'm proud of you

00:20.521 --> 00:22.480
for taking the lead
on this rescue mission.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.065
You would've done the same thing.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.234
You said these people
are wanted by the Empire.

00:26.318 --> 00:29.070
-Do you know why?
-No, but I hear they're closing in.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.363
We better hurry.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.449
So where'd you hear about
these refugees anyway?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.911
You know, one of our contacts.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.330
Speaking of, Chopper,
you better let him know we're here.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.293
Hey, where'd you get that transmitter?

00:45.963 --> 00:48.297
There's no answer. We better hurry.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.732
No. We're too late.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.445
Drag those refugees out of there.

01:12.281 --> 01:13.322
Move!

01:28.964 --> 01:30.965
They are my people.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.925
They're Lasat.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.973
-Move!
-Where are you taking us?

01:39.516 --> 01:42.685
To a detention facility
for a nice, long stay.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.022
More likely a blaster squad.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.992
Hello, hello!

01:58.202 --> 02:01.412
You arrived just in time,
as I knew you would.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.123
You could have warned me
the Empire was here.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.292
But I sold the Lasats to the Empire

02:06.376 --> 02:08.920
knowing the heroes
would save the day.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.005
You being the heroes, of course.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.466
Hondo is your contact?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.676
To be fair, he contacted me.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.094
Yes, to be fair.

02:17.346 --> 02:21.599
Because I knew these two
belonged with that one.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.435
It is him. Captain Orrelios.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.938
By the Ashla.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.773
The prophecy!

02:29.066 --> 02:31.317
-Captain?
-Yes.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.237
Captain Garazeb Orrelios

02:34.404 --> 02:36.948
of the Lasan High Honor Guard.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.578
A reunion! I was right again.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.288
How wonderful.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.290
Hondo could use a little help.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.130
Thought I was just about the last of us.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.549
How is this possible?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.260
Do you remember me, Captain?

02:57.803 --> 03:00.137
You look familiar.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.182
Gron. I served under you in the guard.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.601
This is Chava the Wise.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.145
Yeah, I know who she is.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.398
I didn't know you were a captain.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.191
He never told any of us.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.694
It was so long ago,

03:15.445 --> 03:16.445
I forgot.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.114
We have not.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.741
Well, we've gotta get you out of here.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.868
Wait, wait.

03:21.952 --> 03:25.413
Does this mean
I am not getting my finder's fee?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.123
You never were.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
Perfect answer.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.211
I am so proud of you right now.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.963
I never had a student learn this quickly.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.047
Hold it.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.508
Something wrong, my friends?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.136
Distress call from an officer.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.929
He was meeting an informant here.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.348
Really? My, my.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.684
Well, you know, I just arrived,

03:46.768 --> 03:50.396
but a group of Imperial fugitives,

03:51.064 --> 03:52.565
rebels, I believe,

03:52.691 --> 03:54.150
they just fled the area.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.903
-Where did they go?
-Good question.

03:57.696 --> 04:01.657
I understand, though,
that there is a reward

04:01.742 --> 04:04.076
for that kind of information.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.205
So, tell us where you're headed.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.417
Our new world, Lira San.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.545
Prophesized
in the ancient Lasat writings.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.382
It is a safe system
where our people can begin anew.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.511
Look. The only safe system
for us was Lasan,

04:22.638 --> 04:23.971
and it was destroyed.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.848
Lasan was not destroyed.

04:25.974 --> 04:30.186
It was transformed as part of
the future destiny of our people.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.355
There's no future destiny.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.190
Everything is gone.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.901
We are not gone.

04:37.069 --> 04:42.740
We carry the ways of Lasan within us
and will until we reach our new home.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.202
Everything is happening
as it was meant to.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.997
There. That's them.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.584
Agent Kallus,
the informant came through.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.086
We have the rebels in our sights.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.088
Move in. I'll be there soon.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.091
And, Commander, I want them alive.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.718
The rebels are headed to Bay C-62.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.471
All units, mobilize to intercept.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.352
Ezra, my boy.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.312
It's your pal, Hondo.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.400
What is it, Hondo?

05:17.484 --> 05:21.821
Just so you know, there are
stormtroopers on their way.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.280
How close are they?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.075
Pretty close.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.246
They've got backup!

05:30.330 --> 05:31.872
So do we. Here!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.586
No. We do not fight.
It is no longer our way.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.508
What? You're Lasat. You're warriors.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.801
'Course you fight!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.431
This just keeps getting better.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.108
-We'll never get through now.
-Well, we can't go back.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.502
Hello.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.713
What happened?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.466
Another rescue by Hondo Ohnaka!

06:24.134 --> 06:26.010
Thanks, Hondo. We owe you one.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.553
No. We don't.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.393
Hold it right there.

06:37.230 --> 06:42.485
Well, this must look incriminating.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.232
-Imperial cruiser.
-I see him.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.033
I believe that was them, sir.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.953
Sir, the rebels escaped,

07:34.037 --> 07:36.539
but I think we have a way to find them.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.959
Well, good news. I will help.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.711
Always eager to assist the Empire.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.343
Okay, so where is this new world
we're taking you?

07:49.427 --> 07:52.555
We do not yet
have the location of Lira San.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.931
We have maps if you need 'em.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.934
There is no Lira San, Hera.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.186
It's a myth, an old legend.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.898
The time has come
to prepare the ritual

08:03.066 --> 08:05.276
that will guide us to our new home.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.491
Come on. I'll help you get set up.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.706
Better go make sure
they don't drive that kid crazy.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.916
This is going to be an interesting ride.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.257
I'm not weird.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.467
Quiet, Chopper.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.679
The Ashla led us to the pirate,
then to you,

08:33.763 --> 08:36.765
so that we may find our path
to the new world.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.437
-The Ashla?
-The spirit of the galaxy.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.314
Sounds like the Force.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.191
The Force has many names, Ezra.

08:45.275 --> 08:50.529
And it is through your Force, our Ashla,
that the prophecy comes.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.115
It is written and it is spoken.

08:53.325 --> 08:57.620
The promise of Lira San
will follow the fate of The Three.

08:57.954 --> 09:02.416
The fool, simple and selfish,
he would lead.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.086
The warrior, bold and bloodthirsty,

09:06.171 --> 09:08.631
to hunt the hope of tomorrow.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.425
The child, to destroy him!

09:11.885 --> 09:15.512
We will find our new home only if

09:15.597 --> 09:20.434
the child saves the warrior and the fool.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.479
Well, I have no idea who the fool is,

09:23.688 --> 09:25.648
and I only see one child.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.776
And you're not rescuing this warrior.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.320
Perhaps you are not the warrior?

09:39.496 --> 09:42.706
Well, finding these
unfindable enemies of yours

09:42.832 --> 09:45.000
should be no problem for Hondo,

09:45.335 --> 09:49.004
especially after we work out
the details of my payment.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.924
I assume you have a tracking device.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.262
Well, I was just getting to that.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.930
You see, you are good.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.101
This is why I prefer
to do business with the Empire.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.185
What is your name?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.779
We must begin.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.365
The fool has set events into motion.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.868
The only fools I know are us
for listening to this gunk.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.454
What would you have us do,
Captain? Fight?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.665
Did that serve us on Lasan?

10:29.546 --> 10:31.213
Please, join.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.211
What are you doing?
These are your people.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.630
You act like you want
nothing to do with them.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.258
Chanting ain't gonna
help save anybody.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.594
Why? How do you know?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.929
As captain of the Honor Guard,

11:21.139 --> 11:23.891
I was responsible
for protecting the royal family

11:24.100 --> 11:26.018
and every single Lasat.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.354
Their safety was my duty.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.272
You couldn't have stopped the Empire.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.525
I fought to the end. We held the palace.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.111
And then there was a bomb.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.531
And when I woke up,
it was all just gone.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.493
We retreated. I was as good as dead,

11:43.495 --> 11:45.788
at least until Kanan found me.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.916
Karabast!

11:49.501 --> 11:50.834
I can't imagine.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.838
I lost my parents,
but you must have lost everyone.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.007
But at least you're alive,

11:57.133 --> 11:59.343
and you've got a chance
to help your people again.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.303
They called me Captain.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.889
I don't deserve to be called that.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.308
I failed my people that day.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.560
So don't fail them now.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.656
We are ready for your map.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.832
The path to Lira San will be revealed
through the fates of The Three.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.340
The child must save
the warrior and the fool.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.180
The child must show us the way.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.268
No.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.062
The child of Lasan.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.398
Wait, wait. I'm the child?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.151
I really wanted to be the warrior.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.071
You're kinda acting like a child.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.618
Your bo-rifle, as the ancients used it.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.488
Those systems are beyond
the Outer Rim, in Wild Space.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.697
Not on any map.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.159
The child must show us the way.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.666
That's it. That's it.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.544
Lira San.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.804
How far is it to Lira San?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.432
Well, judging by this...

14:13.937 --> 14:16.355
Power down the hyperdrive.
I'll ready the shields.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.523
Chopper!

14:21.945 --> 14:23.153
What's wrong?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.531
There's something in our path.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.204
What is that?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.181
Imploded star cluster,
biggest one I've ever seen.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.599
Nice save.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.644
lf we get any closer,
the gravity field will destroy us.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.646
What happened? Are we on course?

14:57.814 --> 14:59.898
Sure are, but our course is blocked

14:59.983 --> 15:02.651
by the worst kind of space anomaly
we could've encountered.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.821
This is what happens
when we jump into uncharted space.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.117
This is the maze that was prophesized.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.493
Wait, a maze?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.246
You never said anything about a maze.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.332
You prophecy types always
pull something like this.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.380
Now what?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.344
Attention, rebels.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.764
As much as I might like
to watch you consumed

15:32.849 --> 15:34.308
by the maelstrom before you,

15:34.851 --> 15:37.436
I will offer you a chance to surrender,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.688
an opportunity for survival.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.190
How did he find us?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.568
-Hello, my friends!
-Hondo?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.320
What are you doing with him?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.155
I must apologize, Ezra.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.824
I hid a tracker on that transmitter.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.368
You know, for insurance purposes.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.376
Well, thanks a lot, Hondo.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.878
You've been a great help today.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.547
You have one minute
to prepare for boarding,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.382
or to be destroyed.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.344
I can't believe this. Kallus has got us.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.764
He plays his part, as warrior.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.099
Wait, he is the warrior?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.352
And I got stuck being the child?

16:18.436 --> 16:21.855
There are many warriors,
fools and children, Captain.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.108
The child in you
can't see how things are,

16:25.193 --> 16:26.568
but how they can be.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.237
The fool denies his destiny,

16:29.656 --> 16:33.241
but it is the warrior you are
who will create one.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.786
You are never one of these.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.581
ln time, you become all of them.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.754
Ezra, bring me my bo-rifle.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.881
What are you thinking, buddy?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.969
You can do this, Zeb. I know it.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.473
Just like the ancients used it.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.396
Your time is up, rebels.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.444
Zeb, what are you doing?

17:10.113 --> 17:11.446
Leading the way.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.281
Zeb!

17:14.450 --> 17:15.909
Trust me, Hera.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.831
Sir, the rebel ship
is moving into the anomaly.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.999
Such a nasty place.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.793
Why would they go in there?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.379
Because they believe they can.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.257
Launch fighters to slow them down.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.668
Open fire.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.222
We'll be torn apart!

18:23.686 --> 18:26.188
-Let them go.
-What?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.148
To their destruction.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.941
Let them go.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.360
Pull back, full retreat.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.321
Yes, you'll get them next time.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.824
No. I will watch them be destroyed.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.665
I see it. The way through.

18:47.919 --> 18:51.213
I don't know how,
but the hyperdrive is activating.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.897
Was that really necessary?

19:53.818 --> 19:54.860
Zeb.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.904
-Get him up.
-Captain Orrelios.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.909
Hey, buddy. You hurt?

20:04.495 --> 20:06.162
I've had worse.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.957
I've never seen better.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.418
We're home.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.461
Lira San.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.934
Zeb has been down there a while.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.061
Are you sure he's coming back?

20:30.396 --> 20:31.563
Pretty sure.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.528
You were right.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.407
Well, I'm sorry, Chopper.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.368
You're gonna have to put
all of Zeb's stuff back in his room.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.041
Kinda sad, those two Lasat
all alone on that planet.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.460
They're not alone.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.796
What are you talking about?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.132
There were already Lasat down there.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.385
Lira San is where
my people originally came from.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.390
Yes, Chopper, that means
there's a lot more of him.

21:08.851 --> 21:09.976
Yes.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.770
We can go home now.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.147
Yeah. How do we get home?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.941
Consider this system charted,

21:16.025 --> 21:17.943
which means now
that the Ghost has been here,

21:18.027 --> 21:19.861
we can always come back.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.364
And if we meet any other Lasat,

21:22.448 --> 21:24.032
I will show them the way.
