01:24.651 --> 01:26.819
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

01:34.194 --> 01:37.663
-You think they will hit us now?
-A zombie apocalypse?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.241
Dave.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.303
Sommers.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.673
It sounds like a war zone
out there. What's going on?

02:21.841 --> 02:25.878
Oh, my god. You were right.
There's zombies everywhere.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.548
It's not like anything
I've ever seen.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.917
The station's overrun.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.286
We gotta go!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.255
Okay, we'll follow you.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.790
No, no.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.792
He stays.

02:43.596 --> 02:44.897
I can't just leave him behind!

02:44.899 --> 02:46.231
Look at him!

02:46.233 --> 02:50.802
We can't take him out there
with us. They'll tear him apart.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.238
You leave him be.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.176
He's right.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.446
Leave me.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.852
Leave me!

03:07.487 --> 03:08.620
Let's go!

03:11.457 --> 03:12.558
Come on.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.693
You got a spare gun?

03:15.461 --> 03:18.363
No. Looks like you're
pretty handy with those.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.232
We gotta move.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.976
Watch yourself.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.527
I hate zombies! Okay.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.669
It'll be right up here.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.977
Hey, diesel.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.618
It's right up here.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.555
- You got the keys.
-Yeah.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.433
Come on, come on.
I'm trying, I'm trying!

04:29.769 --> 04:31.270
Come on.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.511
Look at that! They're coming!

04:39.513 --> 04:41.380
Here we go. Go!

04:48.855 --> 04:49.888
Where's everybody?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.291
They probably all run away.
Wouldn't you?

05:01.401 --> 05:02.868
Russo!

05:25.792 --> 05:27.726
Your breath stinks.
You know that?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.094
I'll tell you what.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.737
Get your little butt off my leg.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.041
Shrimp scampi.

05:50.783 --> 05:51.883
Is he it?

05:52.118 --> 05:53.752
-He's it.
-He's all you found?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.621
-Can we get out of here?
-I'm working on it, Marcus!

05:56.623 --> 05:59.024
Almost out of ammo.
I'm not.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.560
Let's cover him.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.891
Where did you find this guy?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.659
Holding cell 3b.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.415
Luke.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.086
Let's go.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.137
So this is how the world ends.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.677
Beaker?

07:28.881 --> 07:30.081
Beaker?

07:30.883 --> 07:32.784
Stanley?
Yeah.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.221
Stanley? Stanley?

07:37.557 --> 07:39.124
Stanley, Stanley!

07:39.126 --> 07:41.026
Close your eyes.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.483
It's been four weeks now.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.619
They say the world has ended.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.622
But I don't believe that.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.257
I can't.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.261
I find more and more
survivors each day.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.830
I still believe in hope.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.102
But with every day,
it gets harder and harder.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.507
I still do.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.080
I wish you were here,
my friend.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.198
I'll see you soon.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.325
It's a little dangerous sitting
on the porch all alone.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.629
Nah. I got my beer,
got my shot gun.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.233
We got a camp for survivors.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.335
You can come back with me
if you want.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.240
I'm not giving up my porch
to them zombies.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.709
All right. Good luck.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.311
Same to you.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.035
There they all are.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.797
It's good work that
you're doing out there.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.333
Not much else to do.

12:50.302 --> 12:52.170
Could sit and listen
to the quiet.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.140
It's definitely not quiet.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.345
Oh, not a cornfield.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.211
Hey, lady, you're bleeding.
Were you bit?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.546
No, she stabbed me.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.383
-Are you okay to move?
-Yeah.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.067
What's up?
Give me a hand.

15:37.636 --> 15:41.039
- Get her legs. Got it?
- Got her.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.509
It's gonna be okay, lady.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.557
Did you bring me anything
this time?

16:06.966 --> 16:07.999
Thank you.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.434
You're welcome.

16:25.217 --> 16:26.184
Hi.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.156
How are you feeling?

16:33.592 --> 16:34.559
Better.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.228
Can I ask you what
happened out there?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.098
We were held up at the law firm,

16:40.699 --> 16:41.699
then the world ended

16:41.701 --> 16:44.302
and this woman
pounding at the door,

16:44.304 --> 16:47.205
we let her in
and she just went crazy.

16:47.207 --> 16:51.409
After she got inside,
she just held us at gunpoint.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.544
She had some sort of vendetta
against the partners.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.047
-Did you know why?
-No.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.549
She lets out living people
to get killed by zombies.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.652
She's got more people
down there.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.122
I never got your name.

17:04.423 --> 17:05.455
Lily.

17:07.559 --> 17:10.328
You gotta get those people
out of there. She's not right.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.196
Thank you, Lily.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.149
Hey, Luke. Come on in.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.690
So? Have you heard anything
from anyone?

17:40.359 --> 17:41.459
Nothing.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.698
We lost Adam.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.834
What? How?

17:51.336 --> 17:54.105
I don't know.
Took a wrong turn.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.274
Got trapped downtown.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.777
It was just...
Too many of them.

18:02.381 --> 18:03.448
What about Rudy?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.285
He made it.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.787
Maybe I was wrong.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.824
Sending people out there
to risk their lives.

18:13.525 --> 18:15.293
There's a lot more people
out there...

18:16.361 --> 18:18.596
And if we leave them,
they will die.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.600
Yeah, but if we send people
out there, they risk their lives

18:22.835 --> 18:25.103
we could use
every capable body in here

18:25.105 --> 18:27.405
to protect the people
that we have here right now.

18:30.509 --> 18:31.776
We are doing the right thing.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.280
I hope you're right.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.553
So? How is it out there?

18:44.323 --> 18:45.423
Same.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.392
Cleared a block, though.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.201
32 people dead.
More people.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.303
Yeah.

18:59.571 --> 19:03.374
3241 zombies killed.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.844
68 people saved.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.448
43 still lost.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.419
There's just still
so many unaccounted for.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.489
And heavy road is leading right
through here.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.460
We have no idea what
we're dealing with.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.395
There's gotta be more towns
like ours.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.565
I've sent...

19:28.367 --> 19:32.570
...distress signals
from all the radio channels.

19:32.572 --> 19:36.874
Twin cities, Rochester,
mankato, des moines.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.510
Through all the proper
law enforcement channels.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.547
And I haven't received
a single response.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.418
What you guys think
about heading up here?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.722
Look, we get everybody
in the school bus...

19:51.957 --> 19:53.691
And we get out.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.561
That's a terrible idea.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.597
Listen, it's hard enough for me
to move alone out there.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.333
We have a population
of 25,000 people

20:02.335 --> 20:05.369
we go to a city,
there's a million,
there's two million people.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.506
Our best bet is to stay
where we are and wait.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.943
We know our ground here
and there's less of them here.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.477
What if no one comes?

20:13.612 --> 20:15.813
What if
we don't make it through?

20:17.916 --> 20:19.517
We gotta make it through.

20:19.851 --> 20:19.850
Well...

20:21.787 --> 20:24.789
I want it known
that I vote that we leave.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.827
I agree with Luke on this one.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.732
We have no idea what
we're dealing with out there.

20:35.334 --> 20:38.903
Hey! Where did you say
Lily came from?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.372
She came from
that law firm downtown.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.744
That's an awful place
to be held up.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.379
Why? What's wrong?

20:48.614 --> 20:49.847
Because it's right here.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.352
So what's wrong?

20:54.820 --> 20:57.488
That's right across from
central park.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.423
You think you can
handle that, Luke?

21:00.359 --> 21:03.394
Maybe we'll send a tactical team
out there with you, Luke.

21:03.695 --> 21:04.929
I should go in alone.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.898
Slip in, slip out,
draws less attention.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.435
That horde out there is the
largest that we've ever seen.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.005
If we send a team in there,

21:14.606 --> 21:17.041
there's more of a reason and
chance for us to be exposed.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.277
Listen, I got this.

21:20.746 --> 21:21.846
Trust me.

21:22.981 --> 21:26.550
Yeah. Let's trust him.
He's got it.

21:27.552 --> 21:28.586
Marcus.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.424
Just keep trying.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.748
Well done, player.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.620
She's pretty.

22:03.588 --> 22:04.755
Yeah, she was.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.458
Was? She turned?

22:08.460 --> 22:09.593
I don't know.

22:09.595 --> 22:14.065
We were supposed to go on our
first date the night you threw
me into jail.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.033
Oh.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.635
I'm sorry about that.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.540
You know, every house I go into,
i expect to find her.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.609
Do you know where she lived?

22:26.044 --> 22:29.747
Yeah, I looked there first,
but she wasn't there.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.018
Was there something you
needed me for?

22:34.619 --> 22:38.055
Yeah...
Actually, I've got
some good news.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.991
We found these.

22:42.994 --> 22:45.863
Look, these are abandoned
tunnels

22:45.865 --> 22:49.400
that lead up into those
old buildings downtown.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.969
Well, this is incredible.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.840
Yeah. Now you don't have
to fight your way
through the hordes.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.041
Thank you.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.444
Hey.

23:02.013 --> 23:03.381
What's her name?

23:03.615 --> 23:04.682
Bena.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.052
Bena. I like that.

23:10.021 --> 23:13.457
You know what?
I got a feeling...

23:13.925 --> 23:15.659
That you're gonna find her.

23:18.096 --> 23:19.663
Well...

23:20.632 --> 23:21.766
Good night, buddy.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.869
Good night and thank you.

23:44.456 --> 23:45.623
Be careful.

23:45.625 --> 23:49.059
Don't you risk anything
too wild out there, okay?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.829
If you can't
bring them back alive,

23:52.464 --> 23:54.064
you just friggin'
leave them behind.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.132
It's gonna be fine.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.701
Just get some space
ready for our new guests

23:57.703 --> 23:58.869
and I'll see you tonight.

23:59.671 --> 24:00.905
You guys want anything?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.540
Rump roast.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.909
Twelve-pack
to go with it.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.881
All right, I'll be back.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.369
Luke?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.206
Haley.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.111
So good to see you.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.181
What are you doing here?

28:38.283 --> 28:40.184
Having a little dinner
with my guests.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.319
Have a seat.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.325
I like the eye patch.
How did you lose the eye?

28:50.929 --> 28:52.096
World ended.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.834
Why are these people tied up?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.335
People?

29:00.438 --> 29:02.072
These aren't people.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.143
They haven't been people
for a really long time.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.048
Haley, these are people.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.785
No, they are the partners.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.455
I don't understand.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.127
Remember what hell
they put me through?

29:23.495 --> 29:24.828
Yeah.

29:25.463 --> 29:26.964
These two...

29:28.266 --> 29:31.101
Are the last remaining partners.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.071
But they've lost
the privilege of speech

29:34.073 --> 29:37.975
because nothing good ever
comes out of their mouths!

29:39.878 --> 29:43.147
They've caused
so much destruction
for their own personal gain.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.882
I thought it was time

29:44.884 --> 29:48.118
that they paid for all the pain
and suffering they caused.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.289
The world's changed, Luke.

29:53.324 --> 29:56.393
Nature has a way
of correcting itself.

29:57.562 --> 30:02.099
These two had it really good
at my expense.

30:02.267 --> 30:05.068
And now the tables have turned.

30:06.337 --> 30:10.207
They are destined
for a very painful death.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.811
Followed by an eternity
of insatiable hunger

30:13.813 --> 30:17.047
being ripped apart by the
very people they preyed upon.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.417
I thought that was fair.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.054
You are right.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.190
The world has ended.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.092
But not like this.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.464
Why don't you come back with me?

30:35.533 --> 30:38.068
Zombies everywhere.
How do you plan to do that?

30:38.937 --> 30:41.505
There's tunnels underneath
the streets.

30:42.207 --> 30:44.241
I'm fine here, Luke.
I'm not leaving.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.376
Haley?

31:00.959 --> 31:02.025
Okay.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.095
Okay.

31:06.097 --> 31:07.130
Let's go.

31:07.498 --> 31:09.099
I'm gonna untie these people.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.036
Fine.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.174
Show me the tunnels.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.055
Tunnels are this way.

31:32.323 --> 31:33.423
Stay close.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.562
Oh my god, she killed them all.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.911
Haley!

32:04.088 --> 32:05.455
Good bye, Luke!

33:10.655 --> 33:12.756
Kids. Why'd it have to be kids?

34:07.145 --> 34:08.245
Hey, Luke.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.331
There's a bunch more
headed this way.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.467
Who's this?
This is my cousin, tala.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.768
Thanks for getting me out
back there.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.471
Yeah, well, we shouldn't have.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.507
I gotta get back to the campus.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.643
Do you guys need a place
to stay? You're welcome.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.844
No, we need to head home.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.281
No, we should go.
It's gonna be dark soon.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.150
Fine, let's go. Come on.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.232
We have guests.

35:02.800 --> 35:02.799
Watch it.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.636
I want to introduce you
to sommers.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.212
This is detective
Stanley sommers, opd.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.547
Is there anybody out there?

35:19.317 --> 35:23.353
Repeat, this is detective
Stanley sommers, opd.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.255
Is there anybody out there?

35:26.825 --> 35:28.391
Over.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.494
Oh, my god!

35:33.865 --> 35:35.365
You found her.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.201
And who's this?

35:38.369 --> 35:41.404
I'm tala.
Tala. So good to meet you.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.474
Were there any survivors?

35:45.343 --> 35:47.277
There was 10,
but they didn't make it.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.746
At least, you two are here.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.382
You guys have a nice place here.

35:52.384 --> 35:56.253
Thank you.
You're more than welcome
to make yourself at home.

35:56.787 --> 36:00.323
Eventually, they're gonna find
you and you're gonna be
trapped here.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.758
What she means to say...

36:02.326 --> 36:04.294
It's not a good idea to stay
somewhere too long.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.696
-No, I said
exactly what I meant.
-Stop.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.498
Okay, thank you.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.269
If you need anything at all,
don't hesitate to ask.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.236
Thanks.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.639
Where are you going?

36:16.207 --> 36:18.241
I'm going to scope out
the place.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.580
Well, I can show you around.

36:23.748 --> 36:24.848
Okay.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.289
- The safest place on campus.
- -It's beautiful.

36:46.437 --> 36:47.571
Watch your step.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.640
It's quite a hideout.

37:12.663 --> 37:14.497
Well, this is it.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.840
It's not much, but it's home.

37:27.545 --> 37:28.912
Soda?
Sure.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.018
So tala,

37:35.020 --> 37:37.587
she didn't seem happy about
spending the night.

37:37.755 --> 37:42.325
Yeah, we started out
living here in town.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.762
And then we found out quickly
it's a lot safer in the country.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.331
This place is supposed
to be safe.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.334
They built it to stand
a nuclear blast, so...

37:51.336 --> 37:53.403
I hope it can keep out
a few zombies.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.306
It's kind of like
the unsinkable ship.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.441
Let's hope it's not like that.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.017
This was a good day.

38:09.654 --> 38:12.756
Delivery man and barista
turned zombie killers.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.426
That picture got me through
a lot.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.717
It's so eerie.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.787
You don't hear this out of town.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.457
I kind of gotten used to it.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.759
Accepting that it's the way
that it is.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.580
Thanks.

39:13.718 --> 39:16.786
It's kind of pointless to make
friends with these people.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.857
'Cause, eventually,
they're gonna turn,

39:20.859 --> 39:23.493
and then eventually someone's
gonna have to kill'em.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.762
If you and I stick around here
long enough,

39:25.764 --> 39:27.497
that's probably gonna be us.

39:35.639 --> 39:36.940
You wanna stay here, don't you?

39:37.808 --> 39:39.509
Would it really be that bad?

39:39.877 --> 39:43.580
I get that you like this guy,
but we need to go home.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.415
Remember your dad?

39:45.716 --> 39:47.917
I'm sick being out there
all by ourselves!

39:47.919 --> 39:49.719
You think I'm not!

39:50.488 --> 39:52.889
Do you know what happens
to people who get comfortable?

39:54.825 --> 39:57.861
We need to go home, get your dad
and keep moving.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.863
We could stay.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.132
We could help them.

40:02.134 --> 40:05.735
You've seen what Luke's done,
imagine if they had us too.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.003
We could bring dad.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.674
Look, would you just
think about it?

40:15.079 --> 40:16.746
Luke's got a bed for you.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.982
I'm fine out here.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.119
Fine.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.538
Well, the bed is yours.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.708
You mean, the cot.

40:45.710 --> 40:50.447
Well, I have something bigger,
but I can't bring it up here.

40:50.449 --> 40:51.681
Where're you gonna sleep?

40:51.683 --> 40:54.184
Well... there's the floor.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.854
This is your room.
I'll take the floor.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.056
Okay, then we'll share.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.993
Not on the first date.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.963
Then the bed's yours.
Okay, fine.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.549
Bena?

41:26.917 --> 41:28.017
Yeah?

41:31.589 --> 41:32.689
You're welcome.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.170
Dave.

42:22.006 --> 42:23.573
I'm so tired.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.644
I have to be strong
for so many people.

42:28.679 --> 42:30.647
And they don't see
what I see out there.

42:30.981 --> 42:34.150
The weight of people's lives
on my shoulders

42:40.257 --> 42:41.558
hey.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.127
Who's this?

42:44.295 --> 42:45.628
This?

42:45.763 --> 42:48.064
This is Dave, my best friend.

42:48.332 --> 42:49.933
Or at least he was.

42:50.634 --> 42:52.168
Why is he locked in here?

42:53.203 --> 42:55.004
Well, he locked himself
in there.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.141
I just haven't been able to
bring myself to kill him.

43:05.649 --> 43:07.016
I lost my mom.

43:09.119 --> 43:11.321
She got sick
and just never got better.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.958
And when she turned...

43:16.026 --> 43:19.629
She immediately killed
my little sister.

43:21.231 --> 43:23.866
I watched her bleed out
in front of me on the floor.

43:24.301 --> 43:25.735
And when she stood up,

43:26.704 --> 43:30.273
there was skin and blood
in her teeth.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.042
And then she lunged at me.

43:33.310 --> 43:35.244
My dad put a kitchen knife
in her back.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.649
And of course that didn't kill
her, just made her angry.

43:41.352 --> 43:43.319
And then she went for my dad...

43:44.855 --> 43:46.956
That's when I got up,
took the knife on her back

43:46.958 --> 43:50.026
and drove it
into the back of her skull.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.034
I killed my mom.

43:59.703 --> 44:00.803
I'm sorry.

44:03.707 --> 44:04.807
We should get back.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.744
Yeah.

44:21.025 --> 44:22.692
Yeah, that was 50.

44:22.694 --> 44:24.894
- I call.
- -What you got?

44:24.896 --> 44:26.896
- Pair of aces.
- -You got me.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.952
What happened?

45:23.187 --> 45:25.088
They came through a wall.

45:25.756 --> 45:28.024
We didn't know that the tunnels
led into this building.

45:28.859 --> 45:30.960
From the looks of it,
they were blocked off.

45:31.261 --> 45:33.229
There's probably still more
of them in there.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.465
I told you guys
this would happen.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.967
There's just no place
that's safe.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.137
They must have followed me in.

45:42.005 --> 45:43.272
Is everyone dead?

45:43.440 --> 45:43.439
Not everyone.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.846
They're gonna be
once the infection sets in.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.417
Where are you going?

45:55.352 --> 45:56.986
To finish this.

45:57.454 --> 45:58.988
I'm going with you.

46:01.058 --> 46:02.992
I can take care of Haley.

46:02.994 --> 46:05.795
Please, stay here.
Take care of them.

46:07.931 --> 46:10.767
I'll be back. I promise.

47:06.224 --> 47:07.323
Haley.

48:08.418 --> 48:10.519
A lot of people died today
because of you.

48:11.255 --> 48:13.322
Horrible deaths, I presume.

48:13.991 --> 48:15.558
You murdered those people.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.462
And now you've come
to murder me.

48:20.631 --> 48:21.931
I came to help you.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.182
Looks like we got some company.

48:41.151 --> 48:42.985
Why are you doing this?

50:05.302 --> 50:06.669
Let me tell you something,
Stanley.

50:06.671 --> 50:10.439
After all this, if you didn't
have a reason to go to Italy...

50:18.048 --> 50:20.750
Real beauty. Real wine.

50:23.620 --> 50:24.787
Real women.

50:24.789 --> 50:30.226
I got a beautiful Italian
woman waiting for me now.

50:35.766 --> 50:37.166
Then here's to her.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.174
Please, tell me it's over.

50:49.146 --> 50:50.346
It is.

50:51.415 --> 50:52.548
All right.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.584
Let's get this place
locked down.

51:18.275 --> 51:19.742
Everything secure?

51:20.510 --> 51:22.144
We closed up all the tunnels.

51:25.215 --> 51:26.549
Where's bena and tala?

51:27.617 --> 51:28.751
It was a tough day.

51:29.586 --> 51:30.853
They went to bed.

51:32.656 --> 51:34.356
I don't think
they're sticking around.

51:38.462 --> 51:40.362
I get it now.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.267
I understand what you
go through out there.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.105
Those people today...

51:50.507 --> 51:51.874
They died because of me.

51:52.409 --> 51:53.542
No.
Yeah.

51:53.877 --> 51:55.744
I'm the one who found
those plans.

51:56.847 --> 51:59.148
I thought that they would
help to save lives.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.650
I just... wanted to help.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.391
It's not your fault.

52:11.228 --> 52:12.528
People are gonna die.

52:13.563 --> 52:14.830
You just can't give up.

52:19.603 --> 52:21.437
I'm really happy you found bena.

52:23.373 --> 52:25.207
Yeah, me too.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.444
Get some rest, brother.

52:38.655 --> 52:39.755
Hey.

52:40.857 --> 52:42.158
Hey.

52:48.598 --> 52:49.765
Good morning.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.734
Good morning.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.269
It's just like old times.

52:53.770 --> 52:54.870
I thought so.

52:57.707 --> 53:00.209
What time is it?
It's ten.

53:00.443 --> 53:02.678
I haven't slept-in that late
in a long time.

53:04.714 --> 53:06.182
Tala and I are leaving.

53:08.218 --> 53:10.519
Oh, I see.

53:12.556 --> 53:14.390
We could really use a ride.

53:26.469 --> 53:27.770
We're gonna miss you, Luke.

53:27.772 --> 53:32.241
Guys, I'm just going out
to the country for a bit.
I'm gonna be back.

53:33.743 --> 53:34.944
Come here.

53:36.513 --> 53:37.913
Take care of yourself.

53:45.522 --> 53:46.789
See you soon, right?

53:47.224 --> 53:48.857
Guys, I'm coming back.

53:49.326 --> 53:51.327
Yeah. Sure.

53:56.499 --> 53:58.334
- You watch him.
- Yeah.

54:04.574 --> 54:08.777
So it's just you and your dad
living alone in the country?

54:09.579 --> 54:11.280
Basically, yeah. I mean,

54:11.282 --> 54:13.415
we try to avoid zombies
when we can

54:13.417 --> 54:14.883
and scavenge from the
neighbors.

54:15.952 --> 54:18.587
We haven't found any survivors,
though.

54:19.689 --> 54:21.323
What brought you to town?

54:21.591 --> 54:24.393
Supplies.
My dad was low on meds.

54:27.964 --> 54:29.498
It's so peaceful out here.

54:30.033 --> 54:31.900
I haven't seen a single zombie.

54:32.302 --> 54:33.869
There's no food for them to eat.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.740
So what started this whole
thing? Does anyone even know?

54:38.541 --> 54:40.876
We lost contact a few days
into the apocalypse.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.680
Last we heard,
the whole us was infected.

54:45.949 --> 54:50.653
Virus, bacteria, chemical
warfare, no one really knows.

54:51.488 --> 54:53.555
I was banking
on bath salts, but...

55:10.840 --> 55:12.741
They're going
right to the house.

55:13.410 --> 55:14.777
What's the plan?

55:17.847 --> 55:19.315
Plan for the worst.

55:43.973 --> 55:45.107
Hey, dad.

55:45.109 --> 55:48.811
-Sweetheart, you okay?
-Yeah, dad, we're fine.

55:50.547 --> 55:51.714
Who is this?
I'm--

55:51.716 --> 55:51.714
uh-uh!

55:53.550 --> 55:55.417
I was asking my daughter,
friend, not you.

55:55.685 --> 55:58.654
Dad, it's fine. This is Luke,
a friend. He's here to help us.

56:01.057 --> 56:02.658
I'm just messing
with you, man.

56:05.729 --> 56:07.730
Here's your meds.
Thanks, tala.

56:09.032 --> 56:12.434
-Can I put my hands down now?
-Yes, you can put them down.

56:12.436 --> 56:14.136
Put your hands down,
i ain't killing you today.

56:14.804 --> 56:16.438
But don't fool around
with my daughter.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.573
Dad!

56:17.575 --> 56:21.443
Okay, there's a huge horde
of zombies headed this way.

56:21.745 --> 56:23.779
We don't get many visitors
around here anymore.

56:24.447 --> 56:26.482
Hey, it's a fit young man!

56:27.417 --> 56:29.485
Think your skill sets ought
to go good together.

56:29.487 --> 56:30.786
Oh, my god.

56:31.821 --> 56:33.856
Okay, we need to leave.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.057
- Leave?
- Yes.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.024
We're not leaving.

56:36.026 --> 56:38.594
My wife and little
girl are buried there.

56:38.728 --> 56:40.896
A bunch of zombies
won't run me out of my house.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.031
If we stay here,
we're asking to get eaten.

56:43.433 --> 56:47.035
Look around, son. We have
everything we need.
We're set up for this.

56:47.504 --> 56:50.406
When the zombies get here,
they're gonna tear us...

56:50.573 --> 56:52.674
And your house to pieces.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.511
Come on, let me show you around.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.113
This is nice.

57:31.115 --> 57:32.714
Where did you find all this?

57:33.783 --> 57:35.050
Been collecting stuff for years.

57:35.052 --> 57:38.086
You never know when government
is gonna try to take over.

57:38.721 --> 57:41.089
Or, you know, zombies
overrun the world.

57:41.224 --> 57:42.591
Or that too.

57:56.606 --> 57:57.806
I do like this.

57:59.776 --> 58:01.810
But there's still
only four of us.

58:02.245 --> 58:04.913
I didn't even show you the
best part yet. Come on.

58:10.753 --> 58:13.622
You see those tanks?
They're wired to detonate.

58:13.624 --> 58:15.090
We have them all
rigged together.

58:15.525 --> 58:17.025
And I have the detonator.

58:19.896 --> 58:20.963
It's wireless.

58:23.132 --> 58:27.102
At this point, even if we
tried, it's not like we
can get through that horde.

58:27.570 --> 58:28.937
You know, they just might pass.

58:28.939 --> 58:33.842
We only have to draw them
into the tanks and boom!
One shot they're all dead.

58:35.678 --> 58:37.145
This could work.

58:43.720 --> 58:47.856
So what you think the
chances are they pass right by
us and we don't have to fight?

58:48.658 --> 58:51.193
I've seen enough movies to know
this is probably a bad idea.

58:51.195 --> 58:52.794
But it could work.

58:53.830 --> 58:56.565
We can go out there.
Three against thousands.

58:57.133 --> 58:58.267
Four.

58:58.269 --> 59:01.803
Four against thousands.
I like those odds.

59:02.572 --> 59:04.306
I think we should face them
head on.

59:41.177 --> 59:42.778
Do you hear that?

59:43.246 --> 59:45.814
I've never heard them sound
like that before.

59:46.916 --> 59:48.850
It's really unsettling.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.056
Here they come!

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.221
Two.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:29.324
Three.

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:44.840
Come on! Get some! Whoo!

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.378
Cover me!

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.836
12, 13, 14, 15.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.440
16, 17, 18.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:22.110
Bring it! Picked the wrong dang
farm didn't ya, freaks!

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:03.852
It's working!

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.922
Come on, baby!
Get some of this!

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:11.393
Ha ha! 22. Loosing count.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.195
23.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:17.799
You're a fat, boy, ain't you?
I didn't even try too hard.
Come on.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.171
Should've counted as two.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.308
You've been eating
a little bit too many people.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.777
We got to hold a little longer!

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:45.060
It's working.
Horde's coming this way!

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.116
Okay, we got to fall back.
Fall back!

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.317
All right, let's get inside.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.873
Ready?

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.307
Yeah. Blow it.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:43.345
All right, brace yourself.
Three, two, one...

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.248
One...

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.983
What is wrong?

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.920
I forgot to flip
the breaker switch.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:55.056
-Where are the circuit breaker?
-Way out there, by the shed.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.157
What?

01:04:56.159 --> 01:04:58.326
Dude, for freaking real?

01:04:58.628 --> 01:04:59.995
You guys, look at that.

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.264
I'm going out there
to turn it on.

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:03.531
I'm going to go with you.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.969
You take care of her.
You guys, looks at that.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:15.010
If we can get to the combine,
we can clear a path. There's not
a single zombie there.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:18.013
Ok, when that thing
turns on, you blow it!

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:19.247
Got it.

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.937
Have you ever driven
one of these before?

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.306
Yeah.

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.575
Okay.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.649
Are you sure about that?

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.352
No.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:04.492
Okay, think I got it.
Engaging thresher.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.733
The combine and zombies.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.536
"Zombine."

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.339
Oh.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.708
-Ugh.
-Urgh.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.345
Ugh.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.615
-We might get stuck.
-Yeah, we're gonna get stuck.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.352
We're getting closer.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.196
I'm never eating corn again.

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:43.498
I don't eat corn.

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:46.601
Almost there.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.714
This was your idea.
You're cleaning the combine.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.348
All right, here we go.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.685
Ahh.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.454
Ready?
Yeah.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.725
Three, two, one...

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.698
I just double-checked everything
upstairs. We're looking good.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.102
I haven't seen anything
down here.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:31.406
I'm actually kind of surprised
that plan worked.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.408
Yeah, me too.
Yeah.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.277
I'm gonna make some breakfast.

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:38.680
Should we wake her up?

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:44.719
Yeah, I'll do it

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.390
you guys are good together.

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:17.551
Hey.

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.256
They're making breakfast.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:40.542
You go ahead. I'll be right up.

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.556
Can you give me and Luke
a minute?

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:12.527
Of course. I love you.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.829
I love you, baby.

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.098
I love you too, dad.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:41.622
The horde is gone. We made it.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:44.792
You're gonna be okay.

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.099
I can't turn into one of them.

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:54.135
I don't want to hurt anybody.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.972
There's still a chance.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:12:59.841
No, there's not.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.910
There's no going back now.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.514
I'm sorry.

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.753
I didn't want it
to end this way.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.655
You know...

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.958
In the world before this...

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.595
We would have
been good for each other.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:23.131
Maybe love.

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.733
Maybe.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:31.839
Luke?

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.441
Yeah.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.010
I need some rest.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:39.781
Okay.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.450
I'm gonna check on you
real soon.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:43.551
Okay.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.933
Did you do this?

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.270
Yes.

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:12.874
Why?

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.844
Because I'm not ready
to let you go.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.147
I'm already dead.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.650
What's that you say...

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.519
About hope?

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:29.991
There is... no hope, Luke!

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.932
Look at me.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.104
Look at me!

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.816
Who do you think you are?

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.120
Huh?

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:04.625
You are a coward!

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.830
You're so selfish.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.167
You couldn't even kill Dave!

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:18.940
You're a coward...

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.933
What's going on?

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.671
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:57.939 --> 01:18:01.842
I received an emergency
broadcast from the CDC.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:05.813
It was just a virus.
A virus!

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:10.851
The body has a natural ability
to fight through it.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:15.222
People are fighting through
the virus!

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:18.793
Dave's gonna be okay!

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:22.196
We're all gonna be okay!

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:33.107
Where's bena?
She come back with you?

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:36.977
I killed her.

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:39.780
Luke...

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.285
All those people I killed...

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:48.022
If I would have just laid low...

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:51.125
Given it more time.
They would have been okay.

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.860
They would have been alive.

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.097
You didn't know.

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:02.436
You thought you were doing
the right thing.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:07.174
We all thought we were doing
the right thing.
