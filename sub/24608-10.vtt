WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.841
Previously on Genius...

00:07.875 --> 00:10.811
SERT: Franco has Hitler
and the Nazis on his side,

00:10.844 --> 00:12.413
Pablo. We need you

00:12.446 --> 00:13.814
-on ours.
-NAZI LIEUTENANT: So then

00:13.847 --> 00:14.815
you did this?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.417
PICASSO:
No.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.651
You did.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.653
So, Luc, tell me about Tunisia.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.654
You should come
and visit sometime.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.090
I should have kissed you
the first time

00:22.123 --> 00:23.591
-I saw you.
-(screams)

00:23.624 --> 00:25.493
-What's going on?
-I'm not sleeping in there.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.396
-Not with these things.
-Where on earth are you going?

00:28.429 --> 00:30.531
-To catch a ferry to Tunisia.
-To be with your teacher friend?

00:30.564 --> 00:33.867
Before we have time
to build a life together?

00:33.901 --> 00:36.837
-But, Pablo, it's beautiful.
-'Cause that's how I see you.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.273
You see the beauty
beneath my ugliness.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.942
What in God's name do you want?!

00:41.975 --> 00:43.844
You know what, Papa,
just forget about me.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.414
Maman, too.
No, wait, you already have.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.848
FRANCOISE: I want
Claude and Paloma to know

00:47.881 --> 00:49.517
the rest of their family.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.018
PICASSO:
You are an angel, Maya.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.021
-And a wonderful big sister.
-They are wonderful children.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.257
I've been getting a marvelous
response to your paintings.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.958
I sold three pieces this month.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.560
MAYA:
She's not like Mama.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.494
If you do not treat her better,

01:00.528 --> 01:02.363
you are going to lose her.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.132
-I should leave you.
-Don't be ridiculous.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.134
-Nobody leaves Picasso!
-RAMIE: I don't think you've met

01:06.167 --> 01:07.968
my cousin Jacqueline.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.337
JACQUELINE:
It's an honor, Monsieur Picasso.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.306
Pablo, I'm leaving you.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.807
PICASSO:
Is there someone else?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.409
FRANCOISE:
Kostas.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.278
Without me, what will

01:17.311 --> 01:19.113
-your life be?
-I don't know.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.649
But it will be my own.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.656
*

01:56.284 --> 01:58.252
*

01:58.286 --> 01:59.987
(insect buzzing)

02:09.863 --> 02:13.834
ARIAS: His Excellency is
in a very talkative mood today.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.637
PICASSO: The same could be said
for His Royal Barber.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.208
I just thought
you'd be overwhelmed with joy

02:20.241 --> 02:22.710
at the news of our beloved
General Franco's recovery

02:22.743 --> 02:24.878
-from influenza.
-Yeah, the bastard

02:24.912 --> 02:26.547
refuses to die.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.182
Hey, shh.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.950
Be careful.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.687
When old men start talking
about dying,

02:33.721 --> 02:36.990
Death pricks up his ears.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.826
Just finish up.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.728
We are gonna be late
for the bullfighting.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.730
JACQUELINE:
Pablo,

02:42.763 --> 02:45.566
you are not going anywhere.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.369
How long were you listening?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.604
You're worse
than Franco's spies.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.643
You know very well
Dr. Bernal does not want you

02:55.676 --> 02:57.044
leaving the house.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.247
Doctors, wh-what do they know?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.682
Mm. I'm feeling fine.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.318
You are not going.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.787
And that's that.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.262
*

03:17.197 --> 03:20.067
Mm. I-I'll see you soon!

03:20.100 --> 03:21.902
-Okay, my friend!
-Amigo! Thank you!

03:21.935 --> 03:24.338
-Hasta la prÃ³xima.
-Thank you! Yeah.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.608
-Bye! Bye!
-(chuckles): Bye.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.009
-(engine starts)
-Didier, will you please

03:29.042 --> 03:32.212
open the gate
for Monsieur Arias?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.085
(shouting indistinctly)

03:38.118 --> 03:39.920
(tires screech)

03:42.756 --> 03:45.158
(gate creaking)

03:46.226 --> 03:48.629
(horn honking)

03:56.169 --> 03:58.972
(both laughing)

03:59.006 --> 04:01.742
(shouting in Spanish)

04:01.775 --> 04:04.177
(both laughing)

04:06.246 --> 04:08.649
(horn honking)

04:13.287 --> 04:16.089
Come to my house.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.958
I want to paint you.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.961
Maybe after work.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.730
No. No, no, no.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.231
(whispering):
No...

04:24.264 --> 04:26.099
I can't wait that long.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.101
(chuckles)

04:28.135 --> 04:31.505
I must get back to work.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.273
(chuckling)

04:33.307 --> 04:35.509
Listen to me.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.279
Quit your job.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.149
I'll take care of you.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.687
Move in with me.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.689
He's already moved on. He's...

04:48.722 --> 04:51.124
found himself some...

04:51.158 --> 04:53.160
20-year-old,

04:53.193 --> 04:55.162
installed her in his mansion.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.264
-Poor thing.
-Mm.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.100
And what about Kostas,
the Greek god of rescue?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.435
Where is he now?

05:01.469 --> 05:03.170
I didn't need rescuing.
I just...

05:03.203 --> 05:05.172
-I just needed...
-Uh-huh.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.840
...some fun.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.442
Oh.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.344
Didn't last long.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.446
(chuckles)

05:12.480 --> 05:13.847
You broke his heart.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.350
Poor Kostas.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.685
So, now what?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.387
I want to move on, too.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.425
Be free of him.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.561
(sighs)

05:27.595 --> 05:30.230
Mm.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.065
Mm!

05:32.099 --> 05:34.301
(grunting)

05:34.334 --> 05:36.970
Shh, you'll wake the children.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.205
(chuckling)

05:41.241 --> 05:42.476
(Paloma giggling)

05:42.510 --> 05:44.478
Vagabonds.
(grunting)

05:44.512 --> 05:46.146
(laughing)

05:46.179 --> 05:48.148
Let me help you.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.818
Thank you.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.220
It's very nice to meet you,
Jacqueline.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.023
Yes. You, too.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.895
*

06:07.968 --> 06:09.937
-Whoa! Two!
-(squeals)

06:09.970 --> 06:11.939
-Very good!
-(laughs)

06:11.972 --> 06:14.207
-Hello...
-Yes.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.387
What?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.789
For a moment,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.358
it was like the first time
I ever saw you.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.127
*

06:35.395 --> 06:37.631
(grunts)

06:37.665 --> 06:41.635
Come. I want to show you
what I have been working on.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.370
Careful, careful.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.906
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.742
Papa always lets us play
with his paints.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.744
PICASSO: Claude, Paloma,
why don't you just go

06:50.778 --> 06:51.879
and unpack your suitcases?

06:51.912 --> 06:54.014
Jacqueline, please help them.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.487
(grunts)

07:06.426 --> 07:08.228
(exhales)

07:08.261 --> 07:10.297
The lines are strong,

07:10.330 --> 07:13.901
but the colors are diffused.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.336
As if the artist
was in two minds

07:16.369 --> 07:18.539
about what he wants.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.575
Listen, um,

07:21.609 --> 07:24.311
tomorrow, you must come
to Cannes with me.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.680
Jacqueline wants
to buy a new house, and...

07:26.714 --> 07:29.850
I am not sure.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.685
Why would you want me
to help you pick a house

07:31.719 --> 07:33.186
for you and Jacqueline?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.188
Because I trust you.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.957
I'm sorry. I'm going back
to Paris tomorrow.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.459
Oh. But I thought
you were staying.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.932
It's your time
with the children, Pablo.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.900
Right.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.675
There is someone else,
isn't there?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.978
That's why you want
to rush home.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
Fine, be a mystery.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.851
Come out with me tonight.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.019
If I bore you, just...

08:06.053 --> 08:08.455
then you can go back to Paris.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.491
(soft jazz playing)

08:17.931 --> 08:21.168
(quietly):
I made a terrible mistake.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.970
I want you back,

08:23.003 --> 08:24.371
and I love you.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.447
You were right, Pablo.
I met someone.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.085
Who is he?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.720
His name is Luc.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.656
He was an art teacher
for a while in Tunisia,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.491
and, um...

08:44.524 --> 08:46.760
now he's back in Paris.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.428
That-That's...

08:48.461 --> 08:50.931
that's the one
you tried to run off to

08:50.964 --> 08:52.766
when the scorpions attacked.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.101
(laughs)

08:54.134 --> 08:55.836
-(chuckles)
-You traded

08:55.869 --> 08:58.606
the greatest artist in the world
for an art teacher?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.240
Last I heard,
Matisse is still alive.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.542
(laughing)

09:05.646 --> 09:07.214
Poor Henri.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.849
You know, he stopped working.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.784
Yeah.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.523
Yeah.

09:16.556 --> 09:21.194
A painter must always reach
for his brush or charcoal,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.263
every day,

09:23.296 --> 09:25.766
if he wants to stay alive.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.937
Do one thing for me.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.206
LUC:
He wants you to go to Spain

09:33.240 --> 09:35.976
-to ride around a bullring?
-No, he can't go to Spain.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.244
Not with Franco in power.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.412
Um...

09:39.446 --> 09:42.149
They built a ring

09:42.182 --> 09:45.653
in the square in Vallauris
for this one bullfight,

09:45.686 --> 09:47.755
-just for him.
-(laughs)

09:47.788 --> 09:49.389
Oh, of course.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.893
Because his ego
is not big enough already.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.896
Someone always rides out
and bows to el presidente,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.465
after which the corrida
can begin. And...

09:58.498 --> 10:01.568
for this one fight, it's him.
I'm sorry.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.905
I was looking forward
to spending time with you, too.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.974
Without the children.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.976
I just don't understand
why it takes you ten days

10:09.009 --> 10:10.077
to prepare for this.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.411
I thought you knew how to ride.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.579
It's dressage.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.481
I need to select a horse,

10:14.514 --> 10:15.582
work with it...

10:15.615 --> 10:17.584
You say you want
to move on from him.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.187
Yet, at the first opportunity,
you let him

10:20.220 --> 10:22.355
-draw you back in.
-I think he sees it

10:22.389 --> 10:24.692
as a way
to close the book on us.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.328
And I-I do think it would be
good for us going forward

10:28.361 --> 10:31.699
to be on friendly terms
for the children.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.135
(cheering)

10:43.143 --> 10:44.544
CROWD:
Picasso! Picasso!

10:44.577 --> 10:49.683
Picasso! Picasso!
Picasso! Picasso!

10:49.717 --> 10:52.720
Picasso! Picasso! Picasso!

10:52.753 --> 10:56.056
Picasso! Picasso! Pi...

10:56.089 --> 10:59.026
(cheering)

10:59.059 --> 11:02.262
(shouting, whooping)

11:04.531 --> 11:06.533
(cheering and applause)

11:10.503 --> 11:13.440
(cheering)

11:15.275 --> 11:16.944
(whistling)

11:36.764 --> 11:40.500
JACQUELINE:
I have some... upsetting news.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.535
Paulo called.

11:42.569 --> 11:46.373
Um, he was very shaken.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.209
He says that, uh,

11:49.242 --> 11:53.180
Olga is dying.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.248
I'm so sorry.

11:55.282 --> 11:59.252
She's in the hospital, and-and
he doesn't think she has long.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.755
Can't you see I'm working?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.757
Didn't you hear me?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.058
She's-she's dying.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.827
I heard.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.864
Aren't you going to visit her?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.266
I don't want
to remember her that way.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.535
Tubes, machines and doctors,
you know.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.370
Hospitals are places of death.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.773
Now leave me alone.
I am painting here.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.113
Is that, uh...

12:26.146 --> 12:27.948
is that how it will be

12:27.981 --> 12:30.750
if I ever fall ill?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.956
You will leave me to suffer
alone in a... in a hospital?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.958
I'm a curse in hospitals.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.960
You wouldn't want me there.
Believe me.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.266
You don't love me.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.768
You don't... you...

12:48.802 --> 12:51.238
I should just leave you.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.773
Do what you want.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.047
This... is what I want.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.831
PICASSO: I'm happy you called,
FranÃ§oise.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.467
Well, I figured, um...

13:54.501 --> 13:57.070
since you were going
to be in Paris anyway...

13:57.104 --> 14:02.042
Yeah, we had many happy years
here, right?

14:02.075 --> 14:04.077
Yes, we did.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.254
Luc and I are getting married.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.197
That's why you came here?

14:24.231 --> 14:27.234
To dangle your happiness
in front of me? Really?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.036
You have Jacqueline.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.837
Mm.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.405
I can't be happy, too?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.041
Are you doing this
to make me jealous?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.508
Because if you are,
you are succeeding.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.910
I can get rid of her,

14:36.944 --> 14:39.012
and you and I can get back
together again.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.714
Huh?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.783
Pablo, this isn't a game. I...

14:45.818 --> 14:48.388
I wanted your blessing.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.990
Yeah?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.893
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.528
No, I am not upset. You know,

14:55.562 --> 14:58.298
just go, get married.
You know, I hope it's a fiasco.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.400
You know where the door is.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.556
Where's my husband?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.725
He's not in the house, Madame?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.595
No. When did you last see him?

15:28.628 --> 15:29.997
A couple of hours ago.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.099
He walked his barber to the car.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.766
Did you see him go back inside?

15:35.835 --> 15:37.270
Idiot!

15:37.304 --> 15:39.439
He snuck off
to see the bulls.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.941
Go find him, bring him home!

15:49.349 --> 15:51.184
-(bellowing)
-AUDIENCE: OlÃ©!

15:51.218 --> 15:53.086
(snorting)

15:53.120 --> 15:54.487
AUDIENCE:
OlÃ©!

15:54.521 --> 15:57.157
(Arias speaking Spanish)

15:57.190 --> 15:59.192
(laughing)

16:03.363 --> 16:05.932
Sorry, but I have strict orders
from Madame Picasso

16:05.965 --> 16:08.135
-to take you home.
-When the corrida is over.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.470
Oh, M-Madame said straight away.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.838
Oh, what's the matter?
You deaf?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.173
-Arias, Arias...
-(grumbles)

16:13.206 --> 16:15.775
-No, it's-it's all right.
-(scoffs)

16:15.808 --> 16:17.610
No, no.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.679
Pablo!

16:19.712 --> 16:22.115
Oh. Come on. Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.284
-Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Shh, shh.
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.019
I'm fine. Just a...
(inhales sharply)

16:26.053 --> 16:27.454
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.956
A little lightheaded.
Didier, come here.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.060
Come here.
Just be a good boy and...

16:33.093 --> 16:36.329
get me some water, please?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.502
Fenasse? Ven aquÃ­.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.504
Come here.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.075
That man that just left--
he's annoying me.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.143
-Don't let him back in.
-Of course, Monsieur.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.979
-Go, go.
-My apologies.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.049
(both laughing)

16:56.083 --> 16:58.518
(speaking Spanish)

17:02.789 --> 17:04.191
I'm gonna smoke another one.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.258
(both laughing)

17:05.292 --> 17:07.527
(speaking Spanish)

17:07.560 --> 17:09.662
(knocking)

17:09.696 --> 17:11.231
-(door opens)
-MAN: Per Signora Simon.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.732
FRANCOISE:
Grazie.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.201
(door closes)

17:14.234 --> 17:16.035
Signora Simon.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.770
It sounds even better
in Italian.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.207
Everything sounds better
in Italian.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.247
-What is it?
-Uh,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.216
it's from Maya.
Paloma is sick,

17:29.249 --> 17:31.618
and Pablo is refusing
to take her to the doctor.

17:31.651 --> 17:35.021
My God, he is unbelievable.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.924
-We have to go.
-No, you telegram

17:37.957 --> 17:40.927
Maya back, and you ask her
to take Paloma to the doctor.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.729
Actually, no. You telegram
that monster himself.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.931
Luc, you don't understand.
He hates hospitals.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.367
-He's refusing to take...
-FranÃ§oise,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.237
this is a ploy by him
to ruin our honeymoon.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
-Do you understand that?
-Maybe.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.174
But what if she's really sick?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.918
LUC: What is he going
to buy next, huh? Versailles?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.255
FRANCOISE:
Stay here.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.090
-(banging on door)
-PICASSO: Coming.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.526
-(banging continues)
-Coming!

18:15.795 --> 18:18.398
-Where's Paloma?
-She's upstairs.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.133
I-I thought you were in Italy.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.768
Jacqueline is taking care
of her.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.936
She'll be fine.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.105
This is my time
with the children.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.177
-FranÃ§oise!
-(sighs)

18:30.210 --> 18:33.746
My love.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.315
Mama.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.350
Yeah... honey.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.025
Come on. Come on.
Come with me.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.161
Come with me. Oh.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
(sighs)

18:52.832 --> 18:55.535
PICASSO:
I feel so guilty.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.904
We had no idea
she was so ill.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.209
If her appendix had burst,
she could have died.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.979
Jacqueline said it was nothing.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.349
You did this deliberately.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.352
You think I infected her?
I-I don't understand.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.854
I think she got sick, and
instead of taking care of her,

19:14.887 --> 19:17.324
you used it as an excuse
to ruin my honeymoon.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.359
I adore her, FranÃ§oise.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.696
-How can you say such a thing?
-Because I know you.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.333
You care about yourself
and no one else.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.304
Well, if that is what
you truly think of me,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.506
I have nothing else
to say to you.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.593
(footsteps retreating)

19:55.194 --> 19:57.930
KAHNWEILER:
Picasso sent me. He, uh,

19:57.964 --> 20:00.533
-wants his art back.
-He can have it all.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.934
What, FranÃ§oise? Are you mad?

20:01.968 --> 20:04.504
I don't want them.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.905
They are worth millions.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.241
You're always saying
he comes between us.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.378
What better way to get rid
of him than get rid of his art?

20:23.923 --> 20:27.727
Please.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.230
-Daniel, not that one.
-I-I'm sorry, FranÃ§oise.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.333
He wants everything.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.203
What am I supposed
to say to him?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.605
I don't care.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.073
You tell him,
if he wants this one back,

20:41.107 --> 20:42.575
he can come get it himself.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.946
KAHNWEILER:
Hmm. Given all of this,

20:46.979 --> 20:49.616
I think
it would be awkward for me

20:49.649 --> 20:52.452
to continue to represent you.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.487
Yes, I'm sure
it would be very awkward

20:54.521 --> 20:56.389
for you to make him angry.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.992
I would be happy to recommend
you to other dealers.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.228
You know very well nobody else

21:02.261 --> 21:05.097
would dare go up against him.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.969
Out!

21:14.140 --> 21:16.476
(door opens, closes)

21:16.509 --> 21:20.012
FranÃ§oise, you had no right
to do that. We are married.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.449
That work belongs to us.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.954
No, Luc. It belongs
to another time in my life.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.656
And if I want
to let all of that go,

21:29.689 --> 21:32.392
it's up to me, not you.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.307
What do you think of it, huh?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.310
(Picasso sniffles)

21:57.484 --> 21:59.886
You must have something to say!

22:01.320 --> 22:03.289
-You... you're a genius.
-(scoffs softly)

22:03.322 --> 22:05.291
Who am I to express an opinion?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.828
You are the one
that I chose to be here.

22:08.861 --> 22:12.164
To challenge me,
to-to inspire me.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.935
Would you like me
to pose for you?

22:26.413 --> 22:28.381
(door closes)

22:36.456 --> 22:39.158
I went to the doctor's today.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.327
Everything all right?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.596
Yes. But, um,

22:43.630 --> 22:47.667
it got me thinking about what
would happen to the children

22:47.700 --> 22:51.504
if, um... if I...

22:51.538 --> 22:53.540
if I had some...

22:53.573 --> 22:56.342
horrible disease or...

22:56.375 --> 22:58.611
if I had got run over
by a bus, you know.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.080
-A bus?
-Or something.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.354
I would take care
of Claude and Paloma.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.523
And I would raise them
as my own.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.259
I know, and that is so sweet.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.930
But it shouldn't be
your financial responsibility

23:17.964 --> 23:19.532
to look after them.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.568
It's his.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.103
He's their father.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.772
So, what are you proposing?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.943
I'm going to ask him to set up
a trust for them.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.749
All we talk about is Picasso.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.285
I feel like
I'm married to him, too.

23:39.318 --> 23:42.154
We are never going
to be free of him, are we?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.629
I'm not asking for much.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.331
Just a small amount placed
into a trust for our children.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.401
But if he won't answer
my letters, what else can I do?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.170
Madame, there are no grounds
upon which to file a lawsuit.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.773
I went to law school.
There's always a way.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.575
You and Picasso
were never married.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.310
His name isn't
on their birth certificates.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.778
Legally, they aren't even
his children.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.815
-Then let's start there.
-(sighs)

24:14.386 --> 24:16.288
Your lawyer is here from Paris.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.857
Oh.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.927
Ah. You could have phoned.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.162
I did... several times.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.365
But your Jacqueline--
she's quite the guard dog.

24:26.398 --> 24:31.103
Well, she protects me, so I can
concentrate on what matters.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.807
We have a problem.
It's FranÃ§oise.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.111
DE SARIAC: Monsieur Picasso
has instructed me

24:39.145 --> 24:40.947
to make you an offer.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.617
In order to forgo the long and
costly legal efforts required

24:44.651 --> 24:47.554
to legitimize your children
under the eyes of the law,

24:47.587 --> 24:50.022
Monsieur Picasso suggests
a simpler solution.

24:52.659 --> 24:56.495
You divorce your husband
and marry Monsieur Picasso.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.267
(laughing)

25:02.869 --> 25:05.237
Ah.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.874
(clears throat)
Is this...

25:07.907 --> 25:10.309
(sighs)
Is this one of his jokes?

25:10.342 --> 25:11.744
No, no, nothing of the sort.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.179
You and Monsieur Picasso

25:13.212 --> 25:14.847
could then divorce
straight away, Madame,

25:14.881 --> 25:16.716
if that is what you desire.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.384
But the children's rights
would be established,

25:18.417 --> 25:20.219
once and for all.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.492
CLAUDE:
You have to do it, Mama.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.828
Yes, Mama. Please!

25:28.861 --> 25:31.263
I can't believe he chose
to involve you in this.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.866
It's all he could talk about
all weekend.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.434
He was so excited!

25:35.467 --> 25:37.203
He talked about marrying me
in front of Jacqueline?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.571
We hardly saw her.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.907
They were fighting
the whole time.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.585
If I were to marry your father,

25:52.619 --> 25:56.689
it would be for legal reasons,

25:56.723 --> 25:58.958
not because we're going
to be a couple.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.627
Yeah, but maybe you could.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.528
And we could be a family again.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.897
Uh, see? It's not...

26:04.931 --> 26:07.600
it's not healthy to fantasize
about things like this.

26:07.634 --> 26:08.968
And what about Luc?

26:09.001 --> 26:10.269
He's been like a father to you.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.971
We like Luc...

26:12.004 --> 26:14.607
but you and he are no better
than Papa and Jacqueline.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.776
PALOMA:
We hear you arguing every night.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.544
We're not arguing,
we're talking.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.412
-We're happy.
-(Claude scoffs)

26:20.446 --> 26:25.351
Didn't you just say it's
unhealthy to fantasize, Mama?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.993
(Luc grunts)

26:39.866 --> 26:43.235
FRANCOISE:
We need to talk.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.104
I'm tired.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.179
I want a divorce.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.849
*

27:13.399 --> 27:15.401
*

27:31.884 --> 27:33.686
FRANCOISE:
Claude, Paloma!

27:33.720 --> 27:35.988
(sighs) Eat.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.990
I'm going to Pierre's
after school,

27:38.024 --> 27:40.426
so I'll, uh, see you at dinner.

27:41.728 --> 27:43.362
Mama?

27:47.399 --> 27:49.401
Of course.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.704
Have a lovely day.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.357
*

28:26.705 --> 28:29.275
You need to see a specialist
in Paris immediately.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.911
It can wait.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.213
My children are visiting.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.715
This is our only time together.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.952
So thank you.

28:39.986 --> 28:44.757
Um, I have a surprise
for both of you.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.894
I know it's not January,
but, uh, you'll be back

28:47.927 --> 28:50.897
in New York then, and, um,

28:50.930 --> 28:53.599
I didn't want to miss
our tradition,

28:53.632 --> 28:57.603
so, um...

28:58.938 --> 29:00.773
Ah, galette des rois.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.776
(Picasso chuckles)

29:03.810 --> 29:05.311
I will serve it.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.280
(clears throat)

29:08.314 --> 29:09.782
Have I ever told you

29:09.816 --> 29:12.384
about the-the time I...

29:12.418 --> 29:15.788
I threw a party
for Henri Rousseau?

29:15.822 --> 29:17.790
Uh, no? No?

29:17.824 --> 29:20.126
Well, he was an old man

29:20.159 --> 29:22.761
who painted his entire life

29:22.795 --> 29:25.297
without no one recognizing
his talent.

29:25.331 --> 29:28.567
So Fernande and I organized
a party to honor him.

29:28.600 --> 29:33.639
And so we ordered a,
a special cake like this one,

29:33.672 --> 29:35.307
but for the wrong day.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.243
-Who is Fernande?
-Nobody wants to hear

29:37.276 --> 29:40.446
about your past, Pablo.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.881
We do.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.052
Bon appÃ©tit.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.755
PICASSO:
Oh.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.091
(laughs)
He got it.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.994
-Papa, I'm too old for this.
-(laughing)

29:55.027 --> 29:58.764
No, no, no. No.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.833
Hold on to your youth
while you can, son.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.969
Yeah, yeah.

30:03.002 --> 30:06.605
All hail King Claude.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.875
(chuckles) Yeah.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.212
(grunts)

30:15.882 --> 30:18.885
Papa, Mama is having
her first show in New York.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.452
You should come.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.988
She would really love it
if you came.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.489
Enough.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.792
You will not speak
of that woman in my house.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.028
She's our mother. We can speak
of her whenever we want.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.729
Shut up, you little cow.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.198
Don't talk to her like that.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.799
PICASSO:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, everyone.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.667
-(chuckling): Please.
-They're spoiled brats, Pablo.

30:35.701 --> 30:36.668
Selfish children.

30:36.702 --> 30:37.803
(crying)

30:37.836 --> 30:39.771
Paloma! Paloma.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.842
Paloma.

30:45.377 --> 30:48.380
*

30:59.191 --> 31:01.560
WOMAN:
Your work is so controlled.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.395
I love its simplicity.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.165
You know, I own a couple
of Picassos.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.367
One of them is of you.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.202
Perhaps you'd like
to come over to my place

31:10.236 --> 31:13.205
and see it on my wall,

31:13.239 --> 31:15.441
tell me the story behind
the creation.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.842
WOMAN 2:
Did you two paint together much?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.578
Did you share a studio with him?

31:19.611 --> 31:22.181
FRANCOISE:
He warned me this would happen.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.516
That I'd be known forever
as his ex-lover

31:24.550 --> 31:25.918
and nothing more.

31:25.952 --> 31:29.956
FranÃ§oise,
you sold five pieces tonight.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.594
If I weren't Picasso's mistress,

31:35.627 --> 31:37.997
do you think that would
have happened?

31:40.299 --> 31:42.634
I moved to New York
thinking I could...

31:45.237 --> 31:46.805
...escape his shadow.

31:46.838 --> 31:50.776
I know what my father
would have said.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.911
Don't run from your problems,
take them on.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.913
JACQUELINE:
That nasty bitch.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.717
Read it. Read it.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.752
And that's just an excerpt.

32:00.786 --> 32:04.723
She's writing
an entire book about you!

32:04.756 --> 32:06.658
PUBLISHER:
He's suing us

32:06.692 --> 32:08.560
for libel and defamation.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.462
Every word I wrote is true.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.065
We're not questioning that,
but at this stage,

32:13.099 --> 32:14.833
we're in the court
of public opinion.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.336
40 artists
and writers have signed

32:17.369 --> 32:19.305
a petition supporting him.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.739
So we'll fight him.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.509
FranÃ§oise, he's a powerful man.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.317
I'm not going to let him win.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.819
The sole purpose of this
purported work of non-fiction,

32:33.852 --> 32:35.854
Monsieur le PrÃ©sident,
is for a jilted lover

32:35.887 --> 32:38.490
to enact revenge on Picasso

32:38.524 --> 32:41.193
by smearing his reputation
with lies.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.195
ARRIGHI: Madame Gilot
has simply portrayed

32:43.229 --> 32:45.864
Monsieur Picasso as she saw him,
using her words,

32:45.897 --> 32:48.334
just as Picasso portrayed
Madame Gilot

32:48.367 --> 32:50.369
as he saw her, using his brush!

32:50.402 --> 32:52.004
-Ah.
-(phone ringing)

32:56.475 --> 32:58.977
Hello.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.814
Hello?

33:04.050 --> 33:06.985
Congratulations.

33:09.755 --> 33:13.325
It's been a while since
we last spoke.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.962
It's been ten years.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.864
(sighs)

33:18.897 --> 33:22.034
Well, you know me.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.371
I only enjoy the company
of winners.

33:25.404 --> 33:30.542
Well, you did everything
you possibly could to...

33:30.576 --> 33:31.643
make me a loser, Pablo.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.979
Yet still you persisted.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.147
Did you read my book?

33:35.181 --> 33:36.715
I ended by thanking you.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.185
What for?

33:39.218 --> 33:41.887
You taught me so much.

33:43.455 --> 33:47.025
We have two beautiful children.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.899
And you-you forced me to...

33:53.932 --> 33:56.702
learn to survive on my own,

33:56.735 --> 34:00.406
to find my voice.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.809
I'll forever be grateful
to you for that.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.314
(sighs)
And I will always love you.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.071
The surgeon will be right in.

34:41.980 --> 34:45.617
You're losing your prostate,
Pablo,

34:45.651 --> 34:48.420
not your life.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.421
Hmm?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.923
It doesn't seem that way to me.

35:00.799 --> 35:04.069
So...

35:04.102 --> 35:09.908
would you rather
make love and die,

35:09.941 --> 35:14.746
or live and paint?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.783
Hmm.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.293
*

35:40.739 --> 35:42.708
(intercom buzzes)

35:42.741 --> 35:44.743
Yes.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.882
Turn him away.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.984
I decide who come...

35:54.420 --> 35:56.688
I decide who comes in
and out of my house.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.990
Understood?

35:59.024 --> 36:01.026
Good.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.899
I'm sorry, Claude,

36:07.933 --> 36:09.368
Monsieur Picasso is very busy
at the moment.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.605
(truck engine rumbling)

36:15.774 --> 36:18.377
The gardener is let in,
but I am not.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.979
I have flown all the way
from New York

36:21.012 --> 36:25.150
to see him, to introduce him
to my girlfriend.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.886
I'm sorry.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.164
Who was at the gate?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.667
-Just the gardener.
-Mm.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.969
Ooh.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.540
Look at all of our children.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.542
(Picasso grunts)

36:50.576 --> 36:52.811
JACQUELINE:
They're so vibrant.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.353
Have you heard
from my children lately?

37:01.387 --> 37:03.689
Huh.

37:03.722 --> 37:07.426
They know I had a surgery,
right?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.428
You asked me to protect you.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.598
So that you could work
without distractions.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.401
You don't have to protect me
from my own family, Jacqueline.

37:15.434 --> 37:19.538
All they want from you
is your money, Pablo.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.040
Hmm?

37:22.073 --> 37:24.610
I am the only one
who truly loves you

37:24.643 --> 37:26.512
and cares about you.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.961
(sighs)

37:42.994 --> 37:45.697
Speaking of which,
your lawyer called...

37:48.099 --> 37:49.768
asking about your will.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.803
No, no, no. We are not talking
about this.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.439
-Pablo.
-To prepare for death--

37:53.472 --> 37:55.106
no, no.
It's just, it's just...

37:55.140 --> 37:56.908
it's a death warrant in itself.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.778
And I'm not ready to die!

37:59.811 --> 38:01.313
(grunting)

38:09.855 --> 38:11.857
There is one thing.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.295
Guernica.

38:20.699 --> 38:25.103
I want it to be displayed
in Spain.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.006
But only after
that bastard Franco

38:28.039 --> 38:30.976
is rotting in his grave.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.311
Hmm.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.915
Yeah.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.990
Why are you an artist?

38:46.725 --> 38:49.160
That's a big question, Dr. Salk.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.295
Oh, please.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.863
Call me Jonas.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.298
(FranÃ§oise sighs)

38:53.331 --> 38:56.768
Well, I want my art
to keep people curious.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.472
I think it's tragic
how adults lose

39:00.506 --> 39:04.510
their sense of wonder
about the world.

39:04.543 --> 39:08.447
Is that the idea
behind modernism?

39:10.549 --> 39:12.918
(laughing):
What?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.953
(laughs)

39:16.755 --> 39:18.724
I'm sorry.
This is the first time

39:18.757 --> 39:20.158
in a very long time

39:20.191 --> 39:22.093
I've had a conversation
about my art

39:22.127 --> 39:25.230
without being asked
about Picasso.

39:27.265 --> 39:30.301
Well, I'm not here
to meet Picasso.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.108
Thank you.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.878
Well, I hope
we can do this again soon.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.181
It's only fair to be direct

39:43.214 --> 39:45.016
about expectations.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.152
Try me.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.155
All right.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.894
One: my art comes first.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.097
Two: I won't sacrifice
my ambitions for a man.

39:59.130 --> 40:02.801
Three: I won't cook...

40:02.834 --> 40:05.403
for a man.

40:05.437 --> 40:08.073
Four: I won't clean up
after a man.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.409
And five: I, um...

40:11.443 --> 40:14.446
I need time to paint every day.

40:16.482 --> 40:19.084
None of that's a problem for me.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.655
JACQUELINE:
Don't be difficult, Pablo.

40:23.689 --> 40:26.257
-(Picasso groans)
-It's the Louvre.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.127
And you would be
the-the first living artist

40:29.160 --> 40:31.229
ever to be exhibited there.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.399
The Louvre is for dead artists,

40:34.432 --> 40:36.401
and I am not dead yet!

40:36.434 --> 40:39.505
And I am certainly
not finished painting.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.140
-(grunts)
-Georges Pompidou.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.142
-What?
-He would be there.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.645
I don't give a damn
about the president of France.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.146
I'm Spanish.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.347
You go.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.249
I have no interest in the past.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.218
I only look forward.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.959
I am tired of painting you.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.595
I need someone new.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.597
Yes.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.465
There is no one else.

41:07.499 --> 41:10.468
I am all you have left.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.830
*

42:08.126 --> 42:10.228
*

42:18.904 --> 42:21.006
(cheering and applause)

42:21.039 --> 42:23.174
PICASSO:
Look how happy they are.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.844
(both chuckle)

42:25.877 --> 42:28.246
It reminds me of MÃ¡laga...

42:28.279 --> 42:32.183
when my father took me
to the bullfights.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.452
CROWD:
OlÃ©!

42:34.485 --> 42:37.355
I should have taken
my sons here more

42:37.388 --> 42:40.525
and, uh, taught them the beauty

42:40.558 --> 42:41.593
of it all,

42:41.627 --> 42:43.361
just like my father did with me.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.196
Well, it's not too late.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.065
I'm sure if you call them,

42:47.098 --> 42:49.534
they would love
to come with you sometime.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.569
Don't you miss them?

42:55.841 --> 42:58.844
You think I don't have a heart,
don't you?

42:59.911 --> 43:02.313
Well...

43:02.347 --> 43:04.650
I think, uh...

43:04.683 --> 43:07.552
I think you're at the bullfight
with your barber

43:07.585 --> 43:10.055
and not with your children.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.057
CROWD:
OlÃ©!

43:12.090 --> 43:13.491
(sighs)

43:13.524 --> 43:15.526
I love them.

43:17.996 --> 43:21.432
But if I ever made them
more important than my art...

43:25.536 --> 43:28.339
...I could never
have accomplished anything.

43:28.373 --> 43:31.576
I don't believe that
for a second.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.979
How would you know?
You cut hair.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.482
I'm sorry.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.584
I-I didn't mean to say that.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.653
No.

43:41.687 --> 43:44.155
No, I'm proud of the work I do.

43:44.189 --> 43:48.026
But first I'm a father
and a husband.

43:48.059 --> 43:51.863
You are a good man, Arias.

43:57.302 --> 44:00.205
Call them, Pablo.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.674
Call them.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.946
(chuckles) Hey.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.314
PALOMA:
Oh, Papa.

44:09.347 --> 44:11.717
PICASSO:
I'm so glad you came.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.752
Yes, oh.

44:16.021 --> 44:18.023
MARIE-THERESE:
Hello, Pablo.

44:20.025 --> 44:22.027
Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se.

44:23.862 --> 44:25.831
Mi niÃ±o Maya.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.667
Hey, Papa.

44:32.871 --> 44:35.741
MARIE-THERESE: The last time
I saw the two of you,

44:35.774 --> 44:37.843
you weren't much older
than Olivier.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.745
I can't believe
you're a grandmother.

44:39.778 --> 44:42.781
Neither can I.

44:49.755 --> 44:51.723
FranÃ§oise.

44:51.757 --> 44:54.760
MARIE-THERESE:
FranÃ§oise.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.065
It's lovely to see you again.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.770
Oh, Paulo.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.604
It's been far too long.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.807
PICASSO:
Son.

45:14.645 --> 45:16.647
Dora.

45:19.885 --> 45:22.120
You look so beautiful.

45:26.591 --> 45:29.227
Are these your children?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.597
Paloma, meet Dora Maar.

45:32.630 --> 45:34.165
It's a pleasure.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.368
And this is Claude.

45:37.402 --> 45:39.704
I've seen your work in New York.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.639
I'm a photographer myself.

45:42.673 --> 45:44.843
He has your eyes.

45:45.844 --> 45:48.079
Be careful.

45:48.113 --> 45:50.849
They are dangerous weapons.

45:52.918 --> 45:56.254
Everyone, let's make a toast.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.289
FERNANDE:
Wait for us.

46:00.325 --> 46:02.327
Olga.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.830
Fernande.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.032
EVA:
And us.

46:09.034 --> 46:11.102
PICASSO:
Eva.

46:11.136 --> 46:13.638
Carles.

46:14.639 --> 46:17.508
Carles...

46:17.542 --> 46:20.478
how are you, my friend?

46:24.850 --> 46:26.818
Pablo. Pablo?

46:26.852 --> 46:28.686
FRANCOISE: We are not
a traditional family,

46:28.719 --> 46:32.523
but we're a family nonetheless.

46:40.331 --> 46:44.502
All bound by blood and love.

46:45.503 --> 46:47.839
It warms my heart

46:47.873 --> 46:51.943
to see the man who has only
looked forward his entire life

46:51.977 --> 46:56.381
taking a moment to look back...

47:06.357 --> 47:09.427
at what is truly important.

47:34.185 --> 47:38.089
Perhaps in the end,

47:38.123 --> 47:42.360
we are your perfect painting,
Pablo.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.870
To Pablo.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.872
MAN:
To Pablo.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.610
I'm here, my love.

47:59.644 --> 48:02.180
I'm here.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.949
What can I do for you?

48:03.982 --> 48:06.918
I need...

48:09.620 --> 48:12.423
I-I need...

48:12.457 --> 48:14.459
-What?
-I need...

48:14.492 --> 48:17.595
I n...

48:17.628 --> 48:19.530
What do you need?

48:19.564 --> 48:22.800
I need paper...

48:22.833 --> 48:25.836
and charcoal.

48:28.173 --> 48:30.141
(Jacqueline sniffles)

48:30.175 --> 48:32.177
("Ay Amor"
by Bola de Nieve playing)

48:49.427 --> 48:52.530
(man singing in Spanish)

49:04.209 --> 49:06.211
*

49:36.241 --> 49:38.243
*

49:55.393 --> 49:57.395
(applause)

50:25.756 --> 50:28.025
CROWD:
OlÃ©!
