WEBVTT

00:03.363 --> 00:06.129
>>> I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF
TRAPPED IN GROUNDHOG DAY WHERE

00:06.228 --> 00:09.461
APPARENTLY EVERY JANUARY WE'LL
BE DOING ANOTHER IMPEACHMENT.

00:09.561 --> 00:14.794
>> THE TRIAL OF A FORMER
PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY VINDICTIVE.

00:14.894 --> 00:18.226
>> ARE WE GOING TO IMPEACH EVERY
POLITICIAN WHO HAS USED THE

00:18.326 --> 00:19.559
WORDS "FIGHT" FIGURATIVELY IN A
SPEECH?

00:19.659 --> 00:21.692
SHAME!

00:21.792 --> 00:26.391
>> WERE MR. TRUMP'S WORDS
INCITEFUL TO THE POINT OF

00:26.490 --> 00:30.690
VIOLENCE?
THERE IS BEEN NO HISTORY OF

00:30.790 --> 00:33.690
VIOLENCE AT TRUMP EVENTS.

00:33.789 --> 00:36.689
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT MY PEOPLE?

00:36.789 --> 00:38.355
THEY SAY I HAVE THE MOST LOYAL
PEOPLE.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.554
WHERE I COULD STAND IN THE
MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE AND SHOOT

00:40.654 --> 00:42.387
SOMEBODY AND I WOULDN'T LOSE ANY
VOTERS.

00:42.487 --> 00:45.320
INCREDIBLE.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.353
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY USED TO
DO TO GUYS LIKE THAT?

00:47.453 --> 00:50.485
THEY WOULD BE CARRIED OUT ON A
STRETCHER, FOLKS.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.018
I WOULD LIKE TO PUNCH HIM IN THE
FACE.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.284
I TELL YOU.

00:55.384 --> 00:57.684
>> HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE FACE AS
HE WAS ESCORTED OUT OF DONALD

00:57.784 --> 00:58.784
TRUMP'S RALLY.

00:58.883 --> 01:01.649
>> YES, HE DESERVED IT.
THE NEXT TIME WE SEE HIM, WE

01:01.749 --> 01:03.215
MIGHT HAVE TO KILL HIM.

01:03.316 --> 01:09.381
>> THE AUDIENCE HIT BACK.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED A LITTLE

01:09.480 --> 01:12.880
BIT MORE OF.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.780
>> TONIGHT'S RALLY WILL BE
POSTPONED.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.545
>> GO IN PEACE.

01:17.645 --> 01:22.178
>> CONFRONTATION THAT HAS TURNED
VIOLENT HAVE BECOME COMMON AT

01:22.278 --> 01:24.444
TRUMP RALLIES.

01:24.544 --> 01:28.976
>> NO DOUBT THE POLITICAL
RHETORIC IS IN DOUBT TO BLAME.

01:29.076 --> 01:31.942
>> THE TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT
TODAY CALLING THOSE ARMED

01:32.043 --> 01:36.042
PROTESTERS WHO STORMED
MICHIGAN'S CAPITOL VERY GOOD

01:36.142 --> 01:43.340
PEOPLE.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.639
>> JANUARY 6th WAS A CULMINATION
OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS.

01:45.739 --> 01:51.138
NOT AN ABERRATION.
THESE TACTICS WERE ROAD TESTED.

01:51.238 --> 01:54.004
HE GETS BACK INTO OFFICE AND IT
HAPPENS AGAIN.

01:54.103 --> 02:02.769
WE'LL HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT
OURSELVES.

02:33.595 --> 02:38.993
>> COME ON, LET'S GO.
COME ON, GIRL, LET'S GO!

02:39.093 --> 02:41.493
>> BUDDY MADE HER CAMEO.

02:41.593 --> 02:46.558
>> I'M SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY
IN AN EMPTY PIZZA PLACE.

02:46.659 --> 02:49.424
I NEED YOU GUYS.

02:49.524 --> 02:51.823
>> JOHN, I GOT PIZZA GOING, TOO.

02:51.923 --> 02:53.857
>> I'M GETTING USED TO THE NO
PEOPLE THING.

02:53.957 --> 02:58.056
I'M KIND OF LIKING IT.
SORRY!

02:58.155 --> 03:00.188
>> NEXT TIME WE GET TOGETHER,
YOU CAN STAY HOME.

03:00.289 --> 03:02.354
>> ALEX WILL BE HOME WITH HER
CATS.

03:02.454 --> 03:04.288
[ LAUGHTER ]

03:04.388 --> 03:07.287
>> IT'S CRAZY WE'RE ABOUT TO
PLUNGE INTO THIS SECOND

03:07.387 --> 03:10.653
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF DONALD J.
TRUMP.

03:10.753 --> 03:12.419
I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT
IMPEACHMENT TRIALS ARE PRETTY

03:12.519 --> 03:16.418
UNUSUAL.
BUT THIS TRIAL IS UNUSUAL EVEN

03:16.518 --> 03:18.684
BY THE STANDARDS OF NORMAL
IMPEACHMENT.

03:18.784 --> 03:22.616
THE TRIGGERING EVENT IN THIS
IMPEACHMENT WAS A MONTH AGO.

03:22.716 --> 03:25.049
WE HAD A HOUSE IMPEACHMENT THAT
TOOK DAYS.

03:25.149 --> 03:27.316
NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO THE
SENATE WHERE EVERYONE IS IN A

03:27.415 --> 03:29.582
HURRY TO GET IT DONE.
IT COULD HAPPEN IN THE COURSE OF

03:29.682 --> 03:32.347
A WEEK.

03:32.447 --> 03:36.047
>> IT FEELS LIKE THE BREVITY OF
THIS IMPEACHMENT IS BY DESIGN

03:36.147 --> 03:37.513
THOUGH, RIGHT?
THE DEMOCRATS LEARNED A LESSON

03:37.613 --> 03:41.113
FROM THE LAST IMPEACHMENT.
SO THEY WENT FOR A VERY NARROW

03:41.212 --> 03:46.211
SINGLE ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.810
>> INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION.

03:47.910 --> 03:53.676
>> SO THE ALL NEW IMPEACHMENT
TEAM IS COMPOSED OF A LOT OF

03:53.776 --> 03:56.675
PROSECUTORS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE
EXPERTISE IN THE U.S.

03:56.775 --> 03:58.109
CONSTITUTION.

03:58.208 --> 04:01.941
>> YES.
AND THEY WILL BE THE ONES MAKING

04:02.041 --> 04:10.972
THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IN
FRONT OF THOSE 100 U.S.

04:11.072 --> 04:11.705
SENATORS.

04:12.238 --> 04:13.438
>> JAMIE RASKIN IS THE LEAD
HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER.

04:13.538 --> 04:14.471
HE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT
BUT HE ALSO HAS A REALLY TRAGIC

04:14.571 --> 04:14.971
PERSONAL STORY.
HIS SON COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THE

04:15.071 --> 04:19.470
VERY END OF 2020.

04:19.570 --> 04:21.069
>> AND ON JANUARY 6th, HE HAD
BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER AND OTHER

04:21.169 --> 04:23.669
MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY TO THE
CAPITOL HILL, ONLY TO HAVE THEM

04:23.769 --> 04:26.768
HIDE IN A LOCKED OFFICE FOR
HOURS.

04:26.868 --> 04:29.635
>> HE STARTED WRITING THE
ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT THAT DAY

04:29.735 --> 04:34.200
AND HAS BEEN THE LEAD PERSON OUT
IN FRONT FOR THE DEMOCRATS EVER

04:34.300 --> 04:35.766
SINCE.

04:35.866 --> 04:38.032
>> ON THE OTHER SIDE, TRUMP HAD
A TEAM OF LAWYERS.

04:38.132 --> 04:43.565
HE LOST THEM TEN DAYS BEFORE THE
OPENING ARGUMENTS.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.098
>> HE BROUGHT IN TWO NEW
LAWYERS.

04:45.198 --> 04:46.797
DAVID SCHOEN AND BRUCE CASTOR.
DAVID SCHOEN REPRESENTED ROGER

04:46.896 --> 04:51.463
STONE IN 2019.
HE WAS CASTOR'S FORMER DISTRICT

04:51.563 --> 04:52.695
ATTORNEY FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND
THEY'RE MAKING A TWO-PRONGED

04:52.795 --> 04:59.461
DEFENSE.

04:59.561 --> 05:04.093
>> ONE ELEMENT WAS TRUMP WAS
WITHIN HIS RIGHTS TO SAY WHAT HE

05:04.193 --> 05:05.159
SAID BECAUSE HIS SPEECH WAS
PROTECTED BY THE FIRST

05:05.260 --> 05:06.059
AMENDMENT.
TO THE SECOND BIG ARGUMENT, THIS

05:06.159 --> 05:06.959
ENTIRE PROCEEDING IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

05:07.059 --> 05:08.192
>> YEAH.
AND IT'S TELLING THAT NOBODY IS

05:08.292 --> 05:09.025
ACTUALLY DEFENDING WHAT HE DID
AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS

05:09.125 --> 05:12.091
WILL PROSECUTE.

05:12.191 --> 05:14.624
>> THE HOUSE MANAGERS HAVE BEEN
REALLY EXPLICIT THAT THEY WANT

05:14.724 --> 05:17.624
THE SUM TOTAL OF THE EVIDENCE
THEY PRESENT TO BE HORRIFYING TO

05:17.723 --> 05:22.422
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
SO THEY'RE GOING FOR A VISCERAL,

05:22.522 --> 05:26.355
EMOTIONAL, MORAL ARGUMENT TO
PROSECUTE THE PRESIDENT ON.

05:26.455 --> 05:34.486
>> YEAH.
I THINK THE OTHER THING THE

05:34.586 --> 05:35.685
DEMOCRATS HAVE LEARNED IS THERE
IS NO BOTTOM WITH THIS GUY.

05:35.785 --> 05:40.285
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE ON.
THEY'RE DONE WITH THAT.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.551
>> BUT I DO LIKE TO THINK THAT
THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRUMP GETTING

05:41.651 --> 05:43.017
CONVICTED IS VERY SMALL BUT IT
IS NOT ZERO.

05:43.117 --> 05:44.351
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD LIKE TO

05:44.450 --> 05:45.583
BELIEVE MAYBE THERE ARE SOME
REPUBLICANS WHOSE MINDS CAN BE

05:45.683 --> 05:48.882
CHANGED.

05:48.983 --> 05:51.349
>> YEAH.
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, A

05:51.449 --> 05:55.481
LOT OF DEMOCRATS THINK EVEN IF
WE CAN'T CONVICT HIM, WE CAN

05:55.581 --> 05:56.847
DENT THE LEGACY.

05:56.947 --> 05:59.879
>> AFTER ALL THE MISSTATEMENTS
AND THE SCANDAL AND THE FIRST

05:59.980 --> 06:03.679
IMPEACHMENT AND NOW AFTER A
SECOND IMPEACHMENT, CAN THEY

06:03.779 --> 06:16.243
FINALLY UP EQUIVOCALLY MAKE
DONALD TRUMP PERSONA NONGRATA.

06:16.343 --> 06:20.542
>> TODAY BEGINS THE HISTORIC
SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF

06:20.642 --> 06:21.609
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

06:21.709 --> 06:22.874
>> HOURS AWAY.

06:22.975 --> 06:25.774
>> THE FIRST VOTE WILL BE ON THE
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF TRYING A

06:25.873 --> 06:29.007
FORMER PRESIDENT, SOMETHING MANY
REPUBLICANS HAVE USED AS A

06:29.106 --> 06:34.038
CRUTCH TO AVOID THIS TRIAL
ALTOGETHER.

06:34.138 --> 06:40.937
>> ALOHA.
WE GOT THAT.

06:41.037 --> 06:42.470
HAVE YOU GOT A LUNCH PAIL OR
SOMETHING?

06:42.570 --> 06:51.235
>> THIS IS IT.

06:51.335 --> 06:53.901
>> YOU'VE GOT THIS OVERREACHING
NARRATIVE.

06:54.001 --> 06:56.833
TRUMP WON'T BE CONVICTED SO THAT
CONTRIBUTES TO THE SENSE OF WHY

06:56.933 --> 06:59.266
ARE WE DOING THIS?
I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS

06:59.366 --> 07:00.932
WONDER THAT.
SO TRUMP IS GONE.

07:01.032 --> 07:03.799
IF HE'S NOT GOING TO GET
CONVICTED, WHAT'S THE POINT

07:03.899 --> 07:04.332
HERE?

07:05.098 --> 07:07.397
>> WE'RE DOING THIS SO IN THE
FUTURE WHEN THESE KINDS OF

07:07.497 --> 07:11.396
THINGS ARISE, THERE IS A
PRECEDENT SET FOR THE IDEA THAT

07:11.496 --> 07:18.395
IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR.

07:18.495 --> 07:22.361
>> THESE GUYS ARE WITH ME.
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT.

07:22.461 --> 07:24.260
THEY'LL GO THROUGH SECURITY.
THANK YOU.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.759
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

07:27.859 --> 07:34.458
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD MORNING.

07:34.558 --> 07:37.024
>> WOULD YOU IMAGINE THERE'S ANY
REPUBLICAN WHO WILL ACTUALLY

07:37.124 --> 07:40.823
STAND UP AND TRY ON DEFEND THE
PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR AND SAY

07:40.923 --> 07:44.223
HE'S NOT GUILTY OF HAVING
INSPIRED INSURRECTION?

07:44.323 --> 07:45.922
WILL ANYONE MAKE THAT CASE?

07:46.022 --> 07:49.487
>> I HOPE NOT.
THEIR SILENCE WILL STAND AS A

07:49.588 --> 07:52.954
TACIT APPROVAL OF WHAT HE DID.
OR THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW IT

07:53.054 --> 07:59.752
DIDN'T MATTER VERY MUCH.
WHEN A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER

07:59.852 --> 08:06.017
WAS KILLED AS A RESULT OF WHAT
HAPPENED.

08:06.117 --> 08:09.350
>> DO YOU STILL THINK BACK ON
THOSE EVENTS ON JANUARY 6th AND

08:09.450 --> 08:10.350
FEEL ANGRY?

08:10.450 --> 08:12.982
>> ABSOLUTELY.
MY OFFICE IS RIGHT UP THERE AND

08:13.082 --> 08:16.115
THIS ENTIRE PARK WAS FILLED WITH
TRUMP PARTISANS WHO WERE

08:16.215 --> 08:20.914
STANDING OUT HERE, GETTING READY
TO STORM THE CAPITOL.

08:21.014 --> 08:24.214
THE PLACE WAS RINGED WITH THESE
FOLKS.

08:24.313 --> 08:31.611
AND I SAID TO MY STAFF STANDING
UP THERE, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE

08:31.711 --> 08:34.211
THING THAT THE IRRESPONSIBILITY
OF ONE HUMAN BEING COULD BRING

08:34.311 --> 08:37.810
US TO THIS POINT.
SO I'M NOT JUST ANGRY ABOUT WHAT

08:37.910 --> 08:40.109
HE DID ONLY WEEKEND.
I'M ANGRY ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO

08:40.210 --> 08:43.609
THE COUNTRY.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.841
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SENT HIS
LAWYERS HERE TODAY TO TRY TO

08:46.942 --> 08:51.807
STOP THE SENATE FROM HEARING THE
FACTS.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.372
THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT IF YOU
COMMIT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE IN

08:55.472 --> 09:01.104
YOUR LAST FEW WEEKS IN OFFICE,
YOU DO IT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL

09:01.205 --> 09:05.836
IMPUNITY.
THIS WOULD CREATE A BRAND NEW

09:05.937 --> 09:10.303
JANUARY EXCEPTION TO THE
CONSTITUTION.

09:10.403 --> 09:12.802
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS FORBIDDEN TO COMMIT

09:12.902 --> 09:16.401
HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
AGAINST THE PEOPLE AT ANY POINT

09:16.501 --> 09:21.200
THAT HE'S IN OFFICE.
INDEED, THAT IS ONE SPECIFIC

09:21.300 --> 09:24.699
REASON THE IMPEACHMENT
CONVICTION AND DISQUALIFICATION

09:24.799 --> 09:28.398
POWERS EXIST, TO PROTECT US
AGAINST PRESIDENTS WHO TRY TO

09:28.498 --> 09:33.198
OVERRUN THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE
IN THEIR ELECTIONS, AND REPLACE

09:33.297 --> 09:38.596
THE RULE OF LAW WITH THE RULE OF
MOBS.

09:38.696 --> 09:41.196
>> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO HEAR FROM ME.

09:41.296 --> 09:49.793
MY NAME IS BRUCE CASTOR.
I AM THE LEAD PROSECUTOR -- LEAD

09:49.893 --> 09:51.726
COUNSEL FOR THE 45th PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

09:51.826 --> 09:54.226
I WAS ASSISTANT D.A. FOR SUCH A
LONG TIME.

09:54.325 --> 09:57.192
I KEEP SAYING PROSECUTOR BUT I
DO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE,

09:57.292 --> 10:03.256
MR. RASKIN.
IF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE OF

10:03.356 --> 10:08.289
THE CHAMBER ACTUALLY THINK THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMITTED A

10:08.389 --> 10:12.922
CRIMINAL OFFENSE, AFTER HE'S OUT
OF OFFICE, YOU GO AND ARREST

10:13.021 --> 10:15.487
HIM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP NO LONGER IS IN

10:15.587 --> 10:18.920
OFFICE.
THE OBJECT OF THE CONSTITUTION

10:19.020 --> 10:23.585
HAS BEEN ACHIEVED.
HE WAS REMOVED BY THE VOTERS.

10:23.685 --> 10:27.285
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

10:27.385 --> 10:33.516
>> MISS BALDWIN.
MISS BALDWIN.

10:33.616 --> 10:36.949
AYE.
MRS. BLACK BURN.

10:37.049 --> 10:37.882
MR. BLOUNT.

10:37.982 --> 10:41.748
>> 56-44.
A BIPARTISAN VOTE WAS SIX

10:41.848 --> 10:43.214
REPUBLICAN SENATORS JOINING
EVERY DEMOCRAT.

10:43.314 --> 10:48.679
>> ADVANCING THE PROCEEDINGS TO
A FULL BLOWN TRIAL.

10:48.779 --> 10:52.978
>> THE PRESIDENT IS WATCHING ALL
OF THIS FROM MARLEAU.

10:53.078 --> 10:55.945
>> IT IS DAY TWO.
TODAY HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS

10:56.044 --> 10:59.443
WILL BEGIN LAYING OUT THEIR CASE
FOR WHY FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD

10:59.544 --> 11:00.410
TRUMP --

11:00.777 --> 11:04.809
>> TO AN UPRISING FROM HIS
FOLLOWERS THAT LEFT HALF A DOZEN

11:04.909 --> 11:08.475
PEOPLE DEAD.

11:08.575 --> 11:11.474
>> DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE
THE CASE THAT THE

11:11.574 --> 11:14.607
INSURRECTIONISTS WHO STORMED THE
CAPITOL THAT DAY WERE ACTING AT

11:14.706 --> 11:15.840
THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.173
AS THEY'RE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT,
THE LAWYERS FOR THE

11:19.273 --> 11:21.539
INSURRECTIONISTS ARE MAKING THE
SAME ARGUMENT.

11:21.639 --> 11:25.071
RIGHT HERE IN THE D.C.
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, MATTHEW

11:25.172 --> 11:30.203
MILLER IS A 22-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM
MARYLAND WHO WAS ARRESTED AFTER

11:30.303 --> 11:33.536
IMAGES SHOWED HIM DEPLOYING A
FIRE EXTINGUISHER AT POLICE

11:33.636 --> 11:35.902
OFFICERS WHO WERE TRYING TO KEEP
PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THE CAPITOL

11:36.002 --> 11:38.234
BUILDING.

11:38.334 --> 11:42.034
>> HE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS
NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE

11:42.134 --> 11:44.233
LAW BEFORE.
HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER AND

11:44.333 --> 11:46.666
GRANDMOTHER.
HE WORKED NORMAL SUBURBAN KID.

11:46.766 --> 11:50.199
THAT DAY, BUT FOR TRUMP'S
EXHORTATIONS AND TRUMP'S

11:50.299 --> 11:53.831
WHIPPING UP THE CROWD, HE NEVER
WOULD HAVE MARCHED OUT TO THE

11:53.931 --> 12:01.596
CAPITOL.

12:01.695 --> 12:04.961
>> HE THEN BECAME INVOLVED IN
POLITICS UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY.

12:05.061 --> 12:08.095
AT LEAST DURING TRUMP'S FIRST
TERM IS WHEN HE BECAME A

12:08.194 --> 12:09.827
FOLLOWER OF WHAT TRUMP HAD TO
SAY.

12:09.927 --> 12:12.194
>> WHAT DEATH HE WAS DOING WHEN
HE GOT TO THE MALL?

12:12.293 --> 12:16.026
>> WHEN HE WAS THERE, HE WAS
LISTENING TO THE SPEECHES AND

12:16.126 --> 12:21.159
WANTED TO BE PART OF HISTORY.
HE WENT DOWN TO SUPPORT TRUMP.

12:21.258 --> 12:25.690
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THE MALL

12:25.790 --> 12:27.656
THAT DAY WAS THERE FOR ANY OTHER
REASON.

12:27.756 --> 12:32.222
THEY WERE THERE IN ORDER TO HEAR
THIS MAN WHOM THEY IDOLIZED.

12:32.322 --> 12:38.320
BUT THEN WHEN TRUMP STARTED
WHIPPING UP THE CROWD, DEMANDING

12:38.420 --> 12:41.586
THAT PEOPLE MARCH TO THE CAPITOL
TO STOP THE STEAL, TO FIGHT LIKE

12:41.686 --> 12:44.353
HELL, ET CETERA, AND OTHER
SPEAKERS CAME IN AND PEOPLE IN

12:44.453 --> 12:48.352
THE CROWDS WERE WHIPPING
THEMSELVES UP INTO A FRENZY,

12:48.452 --> 12:50.584
HE'S A YOUNG AND IMPRESSIONABLE
YOUNG GUY.

12:50.684 --> 12:53.484
HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
AND DECIDED TO MARCH TO THE

12:53.584 --> 12:54.084
CAPITOL.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.583
>> THE REPUBLICANS DEFENDING THE
PRESIDENT SAY IN MANY CASES THAT

12:57.682 --> 12:59.849
THE PRESIDENT WAS BEING
FIGURATIVE.

12:59.949 --> 13:03.548
NOT LITERAL.
BUT YOU'RE STANDING HERE OUTSIDE

13:03.648 --> 13:08.647
OF A PRISON TELLING ME, OH, NO,
IT WAS EXPLICIT.

13:08.747 --> 13:12.147
>> MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU TALK
TO WHO WERE THERE THAT DAY ACTED

13:12.247 --> 13:14.112
AT THE DIRECTION OF TRUMP.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT

13:14.212 --> 13:17.211
ABOUT THAT.
THEY DO STUDIES ON MOB ACTIVITY

13:17.311 --> 13:20.544
AND YOU KNOW, ALL YOU NEED IS
ONE PERSON TO LIGHT THE FUSE AND

13:20.644 --> 13:23.577
THAT'S WHAT TRUMP DID.
THEY'RE HERE LEFT TO PICK UP THE

13:23.676 --> 13:24.810
PIECES OF TRUMP'S WORDS.

13:24.910 --> 13:28.809
>> ARE THEY ASHAPED AT ALL THAT
THEY DID WHAT THEY DID?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.008
>> I THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF REGRET.

13:31.108 --> 13:34.241
THAT THERE WAS AN INVOLVEMENT IN
THIS PARTICULAR ACTIVITY.

13:34.341 --> 13:36.640
MY CLIENT POSSIBLY HAVING A
CRIMINAL RECORD AFTER THIS AND

13:36.740 --> 13:39.540
THE REST OF HIS LIFE CHANGED
BECAUSE HE IS FACING

13:39.640 --> 13:42.273
CONSIDERABLE TIME IN PRISON
BASED ON THE CHARGES.

13:42.372 --> 13:47.005
WHILE TRUMP IS IN MAR-A-LAGO
ENJOYING HIS RETIREMENT.

13:47.105 --> 13:50.570
>> I'VE COME TO REALIZE THESE
ARE NORMAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND

13:50.670 --> 13:51.670
ME.
BY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN

13:51.770 --> 13:55.103
THEIR LIFE, THEY TOOK A
DIFFERENT PATH AND ENDED UP

13:55.203 --> 13:56.469
WHERE THEY DID.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.635
>> THAT SUGGESTS HUMANITY
TEETERS A LITTLE MORE ON A

14:00.735 --> 14:03.168
KNIFE'S EDGE THAN I THINK WE'RE
ACKNOWLEDGING.

14:03.268 --> 14:07.100
>> I THINK THAT'S VERY CORRECT.
WE'VE LIVED IN A DEMOCRACY FOR

14:07.200 --> 14:10.399
OVER 200 YEARS, AND EVERYONE
THOUGHT THE COUNTRY WAS STRONG.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.866
WHAT DID IT TAKE?
ONE GUY TO COME BY TO COME

14:13.965 --> 14:20.297
AROUND AND SHAKE THINGS UP.

14:20.397 --> 14:23.696
>> YOU SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP PRIME
FOR MONTHS HIS SUPPORTERS TO

14:23.796 --> 14:28.195
BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY THEIR
VICTORY WOULD BE LOST WAS IF IT

14:28.295 --> 14:32.128
WAS STOLEN.
JANUARY 6th.

14:32.228 --> 14:36.693
WE KNOW WHY HE PICKED THIS DAY.
IT WAS HIS LAST CHANCE TO STOP A

14:36.793 --> 14:39.992
PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER.

14:40.092 --> 14:42.525
>> YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG AND WE
FIGHT.

14:42.625 --> 14:43.859
WE FIGHT LIKE HELL.

14:43.958 --> 14:49.290
>> 2:24 P.M.
HE TWEETED.

14:49.390 --> 14:52.156
QUOTE, MIKE PENCE DIDN'T HAVE
THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT SHOULD

14:52.256 --> 14:58.222
HAVE BEEN DONE TO PROTECT OUR
COUNTRY AND OUR CONSTITUTION.

14:58.322 --> 15:00.821
>> MIKE PENCE DIDN'T HAVE THE
COURAGE TO DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE

15:00.921 --> 15:12.618
BEEN DONE TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY
AND OUR CONSTITUTION.

15:16.884 --> 15:21.217
>> THAT'S WHAT OUR COMMANDER IN
CHIEF SAW HAPPENING AND THAT WAS

15:21.316 --> 15:24.316
HIS RESPONSE.

15:24.416 --> 15:28.881
>> WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING
ON, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WAS

15:28.981 --> 15:32.780
STILL IN THE ROOM NEAR THE
SENATE CHAMBER.

15:32.880 --> 15:37.512
IT WAS NOT UNTIL 2:26 THAT HE
WAS EVACUATED TO A SECURED

15:37.612 --> 15:41.911
LOCATION.

15:42.011 --> 15:50.509
>> ON JANUARY 6, PRESIDENT TRUMP
LEFT EVERYONE IN THIS CAPITOL

15:50.609 --> 15:53.075
FOR DEAD.

15:53.175 --> 15:57.374
>> THEY TOOK A LOT OF EVIDENCE
AND DISTILLED IT REMARKABLY WELL

15:57.475 --> 15:59.241
AND CONNECTED THE DOTS.

15:59.341 --> 16:00.974
>> THE SENATE STANDS ADJOURNED.

16:01.073 --> 16:10.105
>> IT HELPED LAY OUT THE
CLEAREST MOST COMPREHENSIVE YET.

16:10.205 --> 16:15.571
>> TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THIS

16:15.670 --> 16:16.837
STUFF?

16:16.937 --> 16:19.802
>> I WOULD SAY OVERALL IT WAS
ONE OF THE MOST MOVING DAYS THAT

16:19.902 --> 16:24.202
I'VE EXPERIENCED IN MY TIME IN
THE SENATE.

16:24.302 --> 16:27.701
>> THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH
A LOT OF VIDEO TODAY AND MANY

16:27.800 --> 16:31.834
WERE WATCHING IT, INCLUDING ME,
REALLY STRUCK BY A LOT OF THE

16:31.933 --> 16:34.766
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE WHERE
YOU GOT TO SEE THINGS WE'VE

16:34.866 --> 16:35.732
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

16:35.833 --> 16:40.531
>> RIGHT.
THERE IS A SCENE OF ALL OF US

16:40.631 --> 16:44.497
BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE CHAMBER.
THE POLICE ARE RIGHT THERE AND

16:44.597 --> 16:46.729
THE RIOTERS ARE RIGHT THERE.
IT WAS SCARY.

16:46.830 --> 16:50.396
IT WAS TERRIFYING.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THE

16:50.496 --> 16:58.427
CHAMBER HAD ANY IDEA HOW CLOSE
THEY WERE UNTIL TODAY.

16:58.527 --> 17:01.926
ONE OF THE LINES OF ARGUMENT
THAT WAS SO EFFECTIVE WAS WHAT

17:02.026 --> 17:05.826
DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DO WHEN HE
KNEW WE WERE UNDER ASSAULT?

17:05.926 --> 17:10.558
LITERALLY NOTHING.
HE'S, HE TWEETS OUT THAT PENCE

17:10.658 --> 17:14.123
HAS ABANDONED TRUMP.
THEY HAVE A NOOSE OUTSIDE FOR

17:14.223 --> 17:17.689
PENCE WHILE PENCE IS IN THE
FREAKING CAPITOL.

17:17.789 --> 17:24.854
THAT OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH.
JUST THAT OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH.

17:24.954 --> 17:28.353
>> TODAY I THINK MADE JUST MORE
VIVIDLY CLEAR THAN EVER BEFORE

17:28.454 --> 17:30.519
HOW MUCH TRUMP FED MIKE PENCE TO
THE LIONS.

17:30.619 --> 17:33.319
>> ABSOLUTELY.
NOBODY COULD BE MORE SUB

17:33.419 --> 17:36.752
SERVIENT TO HIM.
HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO PUT

17:36.851 --> 17:38.018
MIKE PENSION IN THE CROSS HAIRS.

17:38.118 --> 17:43.217
>> HOW CAN YOU AT THE PURE LEVEL
OF INTEREST, HOW CAN YOU SAY I

17:43.316 --> 17:44.949
THINK I'M GOING TO STICK WITH
TRUMP.

17:45.049 --> 17:48.649
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MY BEST LONG
TERM SELF-INTERESTS.

17:48.749 --> 17:51.115
>> HE'LL GRIND PEOPLE INTO
SMITHERINES.

17:51.215 --> 17:55.980
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

17:56.081 --> 17:58.946
>> IT IS DAY THREE OF DONALD
TRUMP'S SECOND IMPEACHMENT

17:59.046 --> 17:59.546
TRIAL.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.646
>> HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS
ARE EXPECTED TO WRAP UP THEIR

18:02.745 --> 18:03.745
OPENING ARGUMENTS.

18:03.845 --> 18:06.445
>> THE SENATE HEADS INTO THE
THIRD DAY OF THE SECOND

18:06.545 --> 18:08.777
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.
THE QUESTION REMAINS, WHAT WILL

18:08.877 --> 18:10.077
BE THE OUTCOME?

18:10.177 --> 18:18.241
>> WE HUMBLY, HUMBLY ASK YOU TO
CONVICT PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE

18:18.341 --> 18:25.640
CRIME FOR WHICH HE IS
OVERWHELMINGLY GUILTY OF.

18:25.740 --> 18:32.905
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, IF WE
PRETEND THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN, OR

18:33.005 --> 18:39.937
WORSE, IF WE LET IT GO
UNANSWERED, WHO IS TO SAY IT

18:40.036 --> 18:49.268
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

18:49.368 --> 18:51.368
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT THE
DEMOCRATS WANT TO TEACH DONALD

18:51.467 --> 18:54.966
TRUMP AND PARTICULARLY DONALD
TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS A LESSON, BUT

18:55.067 --> 18:59.565
THE NOTION THAT 50 PLUS 17
SENATORS WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR

18:59.665 --> 19:01.698
NOT DONALD TRUMP CAN BE A
CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE AGAIN

19:01.799 --> 19:09.064
STRIKES ME AS BEING SOMETHING
THAT IS NOT THEIR DECISION TO

19:09.164 --> 19:16.262
MAKE.

19:16.362 --> 19:20.727
>> DURING THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL, ONE OF MY PRINCIPLE

19:20.827 --> 19:22.927
ARGUMENTS AND OF THE DEFENSE
TEAM WAS LISTEN, THEY'LL HAVE AN

19:23.027 --> 19:26.126
ELECTION IN TEN MONTHS.
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE SHOULD

19:26.226 --> 19:27.793
CONTROL.
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS

19:27.893 --> 19:29.558
IMPEACHMENT?
YOU HAVE A SIMPLE RECOMMENDED.

19:29.658 --> 19:31.458
VOTE HIM OUT OF OFFICE.

19:31.558 --> 19:34.124
>> PEOPLE LEARN THINGS ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR THAT IN THE

19:34.224 --> 19:38.023
END MAY NOT BE IMPEACHABLE BUT
MAY REALLY HURT HIS PROSPECTS

19:38.123 --> 19:39.756
FOR RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION.

19:39.856 --> 19:43.588
>> THE THING THAT STRUCK ME
ABOUT THE TESTIMONY IS THAT I

19:43.688 --> 19:46.021
WAS DISTURBED BY WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN

19:46.121 --> 19:50.820
APPROXIMATELY 1:00 IN THE
AFTERNOON AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER

19:50.920 --> 19:54.286
4:00, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
FINALLY CAME IN TO TELL THEM TO

19:54.386 --> 19:56.253
GO HOME.
AND I THINK.

19:56.352 --> 19:59.718
IN THREE AND A HALF HOUR PERIOD,
THAT WAS TOO SLOW.

19:59.818 --> 20:04.017
IN MY MIND, THAT'S A DERELICTION
OF DUTY.

20:04.117 --> 20:07.016
>> WOULDN'T YOU SAY IF
SOMEBODY'S DERELICTION OF DUTY

20:07.116 --> 20:12.848
FOR THREE HOURS, A GREATER
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAN LYING

20:12.948 --> 20:13.815
ABOUT A BLOW JOB?

20:13.915 --> 20:15.481
>> IT'S AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.714
>> HE COULD HAVE STOPPED PEOPLE
FROM KILLING PEOPLE.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.746
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT IT HAS TO START WITH WHAT

20:20.846 --> 20:25.446
THEY CHARGED HERE.
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THERE WAS

20:25.545 --> 20:29.278
INCITEMENT INSURRECTION AS A
FEDERAL CRIME, YOU DON'T HAVE AN

20:29.378 --> 20:31.811
IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.
AND I IMAGINE YOU WILL HEAR --

20:31.911 --> 20:33.977
>> SO IS THAT WHAT YOU FOCUS ON
TOMORROW IN.

20:34.077 --> 20:37.675
>> I WOULD FOCUS ON FAILURE TO
PROVE INCITEMENT VIOLATION OF

20:37.776 --> 20:39.809
CRIMINAL LAW.
I THINK YOU WILL HEAR MUCH ABOUT

20:39.909 --> 20:40.409
THAT.

20:40.776 --> 20:45.174
>> PART OF THAT IS SAYING YOU'RE
NOT

20:45.274 --> 20:46.441
N
INSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S HEAD.

20:46.541 --> 20:50.507
>> TRIAL BY VIDEO WILL NEVER GET
TO YOU WHAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S

20:50.607 --> 20:51.873
INTENT.

20:51.973 --> 20:56.538
>> YOU DO HAVE INSURRECTIONISM.
THEY INTERPRETED IT AS BEING

20:56.638 --> 20:58.071
CREATE VIOLENCE AT THE CAPITOL.

20:58.171 --> 21:01.337
>> I DON'T THINK FIGHT LIKE HELL
IS AN INCITEMENT FOR VIOLENT OR

21:01.437 --> 21:02.004
LAWLESS ACTION.

21:02.103 --> 21:04.536
>> OR NOT TO SHOW WEAKNESS?

21:04.636 --> 21:07.935
>> IF HE SAID TO THEM, I WANT
YOU TO GO TO THE CAPITOL AND

21:08.036 --> 21:11.301
BREAK WINDOWS OR BRING WEAPONS
WITH YOU, I THINK THAT'S A WHOLE

21:11.402 --> 21:14.267
DIFFERENT SITUATION.
I'M NOT ENDORSING ANY OF THOSE

21:14.367 --> 21:14.601
ACTIONS.

21:14.701 --> 21:15.734
>> SURE.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.333
>> THEY SHOULD BE CONDEMNED.
I THINK THERE WERE SERIOUS

21:19.433 --> 21:23.399
ERRORS IN JUDGMENT TO ALLOW THIS
TO GET TO THIS POINT BUT I DON'T

21:23.499 --> 21:25.098
THINK IT IS AN IMPEACHABLE
OFFENSE.

21:25.198 --> 21:28.930
THERE'S A LOT OF BAD STUFF THAT
HAPPENS THAT IS STILL BAD BUT

21:29.031 --> 21:31.230
NOT NECESSARILY IMPEACHABLE OR
CRIMINAL.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.929
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
INCLUDING SENATORS HAVE LEARNED

21:34.030 --> 21:36.295
THINGS THAT WENT ON THAT WE
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.295
>> YOU CAN COUNT ME IN THAT,
TOO.

21:38.396 --> 21:41.762
A PRESENTATION TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, I WILL GRANT YOU, I

21:41.861 --> 21:44.227
THINK HAS BEEN A SERVICE TO THE
COUNTRY.

21:44.327 --> 21:47.227
SO I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.
I THINK IT HAS SERVED A USEFUL

21:47.327 --> 21:51.393
PURPOSE, YES.

21:51.493 --> 21:54.692
>> FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DEFENSE LAWYERS HAD TAKE THE

21:54.791 --> 21:57.290
SENATE FLOOR TODAY.
HIS LEGAL TEAM SAYS IT WILL ONLY

21:57.391 --> 22:02.656
NEED A FEW HOURS TO REBUT THE
DEMOCRATS' CASE.

22:02.757 --> 22:06.322
>> AM I RIGHT TO SAY YOU BABBLED
OND THIS OFFICE IN MARCH OF LAST

22:06.422 --> 22:11.421
YEAR, ALMOST A FULL YEAR AGO?
A LIVING TIME CAPSULE.

22:11.521 --> 22:17.486
>> THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE IS
GOING TO OFFER A VERY COMPACT

22:17.586 --> 22:20.885
DEFENSE TODAY.
WE KNOW THEY ARE DOING ONLY A

22:20.985 --> 22:23.752
FEW HOURS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

22:23.852 --> 22:26.851
>> I THINK THEY HAVE COUNTED THE
VOTES AND THEIR VIEW IS THEY ARE

22:26.951 --> 22:28.684
HOME.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO AS LITTLE

22:28.784 --> 22:31.449
DAMAGE AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.
AND I THINK WHAT THEY'RE GOING

22:31.549 --> 22:36.582
TO BE LEFT WITH IS MAKING
LAWYERS' TRICK THAT'S WILL GIVE

22:36.682 --> 22:40.148
PEOPLE WHO VOTE NO A PRETEXT FOR
VOTING NO.

22:40.247 --> 22:42.713
OR AN EXCUSE.

22:42.813 --> 22:46.246
>> I THINK YOUR VIEW LIKE
EVERYBODY'S VIEW, THE LIKELY OF

22:46.346 --> 22:47.413
CONVICTION IS VERY LOW.

22:47.512 --> 22:50.745
>> MY SENSE IS THAT MITCH
McCONNELL HAS NOT MADE UP HIS

22:50.845 --> 22:53.644
MIND.
IF HE DECIDED TO VOTE TO

22:53.745 --> 22:58.243
CONVICT, HE COULD TAKE SOME
PEOPLE WITH HIM.

22:58.343 --> 23:02.975
IN HIS MIND, YOU CAN ONLY SEE
THE WHEELS TURNING AS HE IS

23:03.075 --> 23:04.942
SITTING THERE.
THE QUESTION FOR HIM, WHAT IS

23:05.042 --> 23:09.141
THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO TO
GET US BACK INTO POWER?

23:09.241 --> 23:14.240
WHAT HE'S FACED WITH IS, ON THE
ONE HAND, IF THEY VOTE TO

23:14.339 --> 23:17.839
CONVICT HIM AND THEY ACTUALLY DO
CONVICT HIM, THEY'RE IN FOR A

23:17.939 --> 23:23.871
LOT OF VERY SERIOUS SHORT TERM
PAIN FROM THE TRUMP BASE.

23:23.971 --> 23:24.970
>> BIG BACK LASH.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.803
>> HUGE BACK LASH.
BUT THEY'VE TAKEN THE PARTY BACK

23:27.903 --> 23:30.203
FROM DONALD TRUMP.
IF THEY VOTE TO ACQUIT, THEN

23:30.303 --> 23:34.002
THEY'VE TURNED THE KEYS OVER OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO DONALD

23:34.102 --> 23:38.734
TRUMP.
SAD TO SAY.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.834
>> OKAY.
TEN MINUTES.

23:39.934 --> 23:47.765
>> OKAY.
I'M READY.

23:47.865 --> 23:53.430
>> TO CLAIM THAT THE PRESIDENT
IN ANY WAY WISHED, DESIRED OR

23:53.530 --> 23:58.563
ENCOURAGED LAWLESS OR VIOLENT
BEHAVIOR IS A PREPOSTEROUS AND

23:58.663 --> 24:01.762
MONSTROUS LIE.
LIKE EVERY OTHER POLITICALLY

24:01.862 --> 24:05.794
MOTIVATED WITCH HUNT, THE LEFT
HAS ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST

24:05.894 --> 24:06.527
FOUR YEARS.

24:06.627 --> 24:08.294
>> WORDS MATTER.
THEY TOLD YOU.

24:08.394 --> 24:11.560
WE HEARD A LOT THIS WEEK ABOUT
FIGHT LIKE HELL.

24:11.660 --> 24:15.425
BUT THEY CUT OFF THE VIDEO
BEFORE THEY SHOWED YOU THE

24:15.525 --> 24:19.958
PRESIDENT'S OPTIMISTIC,
PATRIOTIC WORDS THAT FOLLOWED

24:20.057 --> 24:21.024
IMMEDIATELY AFTER.

24:21.124 --> 24:25.156
>> FIGHT LIKE HELL.
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT LIKE HELL,

24:25.256 --> 24:27.923
YOU WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY
ANYMORE.

24:28.023 --> 24:31.989
OUR EXCITING ADVENTURES HAVE NOT
YET BEGUN.

24:32.089 --> 24:37.987
>> LET US BE CLEAR, THIS TRIAL
IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN PRESIDENT

24:38.087 --> 24:42.186
TRUMP.
IT IS ABOUT CANCELING 75 MILLION

24:42.286 --> 24:46.452
TRUMP VOTERS.
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW CANCELING

24:46.552 --> 24:51.517
AND BANNING AND SILENCING TO BE
SANCTIONED IN THIS BODY?

24:51.616 --> 24:55.450
>> THIS CONCLUDES THE FORMER
DEFENSE OF THE 45th PRESIDENT OF

24:55.550 --> 25:05.613
THE UNITED STATES.

25:05.714 --> 25:10.646
>> I CAN REMEMBER WALKING AROUND
THIS PAR IN JUNE OF 2014, THE

25:10.746 --> 25:12.712
NIGHT THEY VOTED ON GAY
MARRIAGE.

25:12.812 --> 25:17.445
>> THE CONFEDERATE FLAG DOWN
FROM THE SOUTH CAROLINA STATE

25:17.545 --> 25:18.410
CAPITOL.
OBAMACARE HAD BEEN HELD UP THAT

25:18.510 --> 25:21.710
WEEK, ALL OF IT.
AND MY FRIEND FROM THE OBAMA

25:21.810 --> 25:24.543
WHITE HOUSE AND BEING REALLY
EXCITED AND THEN THINKING, A LOT

25:24.643 --> 25:28.342
OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA, WHEN THEY
SEE THE CONFEDERATE FLAG COME

25:28.442 --> 25:32.341
DOWN, WHEN THEY SEE GAY MARRIAGE
HELD UP, FEEL LIKE THIS ISN'T

25:32.441 --> 25:33.307
THEIR COUNTRY ANYMORE.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.306
>> YEAH.
A LOT OF PEOPLE VIEWED THE

25:36.406 --> 25:41.938
ELECTION OF BARACK OBAMA AS A
MOMENT OF GREAT PROGRESS AND IT

25:42.038 --> 25:50.403
WAS.
BUT ANY STUDENT OF HISTORY WOULD

25:50.503 --> 25:54.269
HAVE KNOWN HIS ELECTION WAS
LIKELY TO TRIGGER AN IMMENSE

25:54.369 --> 25:58.468
BACK LASH AND IT DID.
IT STARTED WITH THE TEA PARTY.

25:58.568 --> 26:04.534
BUT CULMINATED WITH THE ELECTION
OF DONALD TRUMP AND ENDING WITH

26:04.633 --> 26:13.098
VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES DURING THE
INSURRECTION ON JANUARY 6th.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.297
>> YOU WERE AN IMPEACHMENT
MANAGER OF THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT

26:15.397 --> 26:18.164
OF DONALD TRUMP.
HE IS LIKELY TO BE ACQUITTED

26:18.264 --> 26:19.964
AGAIN.
DOES THAT SEND A MESSAGE THAT HE

26:20.063 --> 26:21.263
HAS NOT BEEN REPUDIATED?

26:21.363 --> 26:24.128
>> THE TRIAL IS IMPORTANT
HOPEFULLY TO BRING ABOUT

26:24.228 --> 26:28.194
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE WAY THAT
THE FRAMERS ENVISIONED.

26:28.294 --> 26:33.060
THE FACT THAT SO MANY SENATE
REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO LOOK

26:33.160 --> 26:38.492
PAST THE EVIDENCE TO VOTE TO
ACQUIT IS SAD AND SHAMEFUL, AND

26:38.592 --> 26:41.991
WHILE THEY MAY NOT BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE BY REPUBLICAN VOTERS

26:42.091 --> 26:44.557
IN THE SHORT TERM.
THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

26:44.657 --> 26:48.489
THROUGH THE LENS OF HISTORY.

26:48.589 --> 26:54.822
>> DO YOU FEEL THAT COMING OUT
OF THIS, WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF

26:54.921 --> 26:56.021
REVITALIZATION OF DEMOCRACY?

26:56.121 --> 27:00.387
>> IT IS THE CLASSIC CLASH
BETWEEN PROGRESS AND BACK LASH.

27:00.487 --> 27:07.552
EVERY TIME WE'VE MADE PROGRESS
IN AMERICA, WE'VE CONFRONT BACK

27:07.652 --> 27:14.384
LASH AND EMERGED FROM THAT TO
CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS.

27:14.483 --> 27:18.616
SO I'M HOPEFUL.
THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION

27:18.716 --> 27:21.782
WEREN'T PERFECT.
THEY DIDN'T PROMISE A PERFECT

27:21.882 --> 27:23.581
COUNTRY.
THEY DID PROMISE A JOURNEY

27:23.682 --> 27:27.348
TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION, AND
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN ON.

27:27.447 --> 27:33.546
I'M CONFIDENT THAT WILL
CONTINUE.

27:33.646 --> 27:37.912
>> MR. BENNETT.
MR. BENNETT, GUILTY.

27:38.011 --> 27:43.110
MISS COLLINS.
GUILTY.

27:43.210 --> 27:46.143
NOT GUILTY.
MISS DUCKWORTH, GUILTY.

27:46.243 --> 27:48.475
MR. GRAHAM.
NOT GUILTY.

27:48.575 --> 27:53.441
MRS. GILLIBRAND.
MR. HAWLEY, NOT GUILTY.

27:53.541 --> 27:58.540
MR. McCONNELL.
MR. McCONNELL, NOT GUILTY.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.273
>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES DONALD J. TRUMP

28:01.373 --> 28:05.172
HAS NOW BEEN ACQUITTED BY THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.

28:05.272 --> 28:09.471
57-43 VOTES, FALLING SHORT OF
THE 67 VOTES NEEDED TO CONVICT

28:09.570 --> 28:12.771
TRUMP.

28:12.870 --> 28:17.702
>> JANUARY 6th WAS A DISGRACE.
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

28:17.802 --> 28:25.200
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PRACTICALLY
AND MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

28:25.301 --> 28:29.800
PROVOKING THE EVENTS OF THE DAY.
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACTIONS

28:29.899 --> 28:34.565
WERE A DISGRACEFUL DERELICTION
OF DUTY.
