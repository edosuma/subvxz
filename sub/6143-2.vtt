00:21.633 --> 00:23.133
-Hello, name please?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.467
-Uh, Hannah.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.333
-Oh, g'day, Hannah.
How can we help you?

00:26.367 --> 00:31.500
-Um, I need-- My phone's been
cut off. I forgot to pay
the bill.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.800
-Okay. Let me transfer
you to billing.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.100
-Um, no, um...

00:36.133 --> 00:37.333
-(music resumes)
-No!

00:37.367 --> 00:38.367
Oh, fuck.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.367
We will be with you shortly.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.133
Thanks for your patience.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.433

01:14.100 --> 01:15.400
Fuck!

01:30.467 --> 01:31.567
(sniffling)

01:31.600 --> 01:34.267
-You are first in the queue.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.767
We will be with you shortly.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.133
Thanks for your patience.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.200
-* Ooh

01:40.233 --> 01:43.333
* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah

01:43.367 --> 01:45.300
* Ooh

01:45.333 --> 01:47.067
* Okay, yeah

01:47.100 --> 01:51.600
* Oh, the good Lord knows it,
oh, the good Lord knows it *

01:51.633 --> 01:53.667
* I left better behind

01:53.700 --> 01:56.267
* I'll be fine

01:56.300 --> 01:57.533
* Yeah, yeah

01:57.567 --> 02:00.567
* Make my mama turn
another blind eye *

02:00.600 --> 02:02.567
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:02.600 --> 02:05.200
* I left better behind
I'll be fine *

02:07.567 --> 02:09.500
-Hannah, dinner's ready.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.333
Yum, yum! Dinner!

02:11.367 --> 02:12.467
-Yeah, all right.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.833
-Mae, that--
That's a lot of cheese.

02:43.867 --> 02:45.667
-You say that every time.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.267
Every time we have pasta,

02:47.300 --> 02:49.100
you say
"That's a lot of cheese."

02:49.133 --> 02:50.633
I know it's a lot of cheese.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.267
That is how much cheese I like.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.633
So, please,

02:53.667 --> 02:56.233
take a mental note
that I like a lot of cheese

02:56.267 --> 02:58.533
so we don't have to talk
about it again. Okay?

03:00.433 --> 03:03.500
-Okay. Have as much cheese
as you like.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.167
-Yes.

03:09.267 --> 03:11.700
(sobbing)

03:11.733 --> 03:13.067
-What's the matter?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.200
Is it that time of the month?

03:16.233 --> 03:18.067
-No!

03:21.433 --> 03:23.467
I had sex with a man.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.233
A different man.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.767
-Josh, what is this?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.500
-It's a French stick.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.133
-I thought we weren't
eating bread?

03:45.167 --> 03:47.033
-Oh, yeah, I thought it might
be nice to have some bread.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.600
-Josh, why are you doing this?

03:48.633 --> 03:51.233
-I just thought, maybe,
bread isn't actually
the enemy.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.667
-Do you know how many times
over the last two weeks

03:53.700 --> 03:56.133
I've wanted to eat white food
and I didn't?

03:56.167 --> 03:57.133
Do you know why I didn't?

03:57.167 --> 03:59.167
-Because it spikes
your blood sugar.
-No!

03:59.200 --> 04:00.200
-No?

04:00.233 --> 04:01.500
-Well, yes, but also,

04:01.533 --> 04:03.233
I did it for us.
Because of us.

04:03.267 --> 04:04.400
And now you're quitting on me?

04:04.433 --> 04:05.733
-No, don't you say that.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.767
That's not true, Tom,
I couldn't quit you.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.133
-I mean, surely Arnold
doesn't eat bread. So fit.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.700
You're just gonna get
fat for Arnold now?

04:11.733 --> 04:12.900
-More to love.
-No, it's not more to love!

04:12.933 --> 04:15.633
It's the same amount to love,
it's just spread thinner!

04:15.667 --> 04:18.500
There were doughnuts at
the office today, and I didn't
touch them.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.667
-You did touch your boss'
junk, though.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.667
Right, Tom?

04:22.700 --> 04:24.133
Am I right?

04:24.167 --> 04:25.233
Tom...

04:26.567 --> 04:28.200
-Did you get your fine
sorted out?

04:28.233 --> 04:30.567
-No.
-Oh, what happened?

04:30.600 --> 04:31.600
-Dinner.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.300
-Well, you really
gotta get it sorted, Hannah.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.033
It's been weeks.
People wanna call you.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.667
-What people?

04:36.700 --> 04:37.833
-Me.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.200
-Why would you call me?
I'm right here.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.567
You're right there.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.200
This is where
we always are.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.267
-Hey, it's Friday night.
-Yeah.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.667
-Well, we should go out.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.600
-Out?
-Yeah, out.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.033
-No.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.400
-Yeah.
-No.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.800
-I want to go
to a lesbian bar.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.233
-Why would you want
to go to a bar?

04:56.267 --> 04:58.200
You got a lesbian
and a beer right here.

04:58.233 --> 05:01.500
-Please, take me,
Hannah, please?

05:01.533 --> 05:03.300
-Is this your way
of telling me you're a lesbian?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.067
-No.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.033
-Just thought I would ask.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.567
Can't be too careful these days.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.067
-Will you say something?

05:12.200 --> 05:13.567
-Let me finish this.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.600
Or it'll get cold.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.467
I used the good mince,
I want to finish it.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.700
-Okay.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.033
It was ages ago.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.633
Last year.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.733
I was pregnant.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.267
I had no control, Alan.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.433
I was a slave
to my pregnant hormones.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.167
I bit your arm.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.267
I tried to repaint
the bathroom.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.700
I cry at the butcher's,
and I had an affair.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.767
-Okay.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.100
Who was he?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.600
-I don't know his name.

06:19.633 --> 06:22.100
-All right.
Would I know his name?

06:22.133 --> 06:23.367
-No.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.533
I'm sorry, Alan.

06:27.567 --> 06:30.367
I don't know what
I was thinking.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.833
Like, the time when you
decided we should go
kite-surfing.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.333
You know...

06:39.267 --> 06:41.000
-Where did you meet him?

06:43.233 --> 06:44.833
-A website.

06:44.867 --> 06:46.567
-The Internet?
-Yeah.

06:48.167 --> 06:50.433
-Bloody Internet!

06:50.467 --> 06:52.267
Sick of it.

06:55.400 --> 06:59.233
-Our farming changed the genetic
structure of wheat faster than
we could evolve alongside it,

06:59.267 --> 07:00.100
and now it is poison.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.700
-Bread is low
in essential nutrients.

07:01.733 --> 07:03.333
-It makes you more hungry.
-Gluten!

07:03.367 --> 07:04.700
-Fucking gluten, Josh.

07:04.733 --> 07:05.633
-Fuck off, gluten.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.100
-You bloat me, gluten.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.733
-(chuckling) Yeah.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.167
Mmm.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.267
Um...

07:12.300 --> 07:16.267
So, I was just thinking maybe
it's just okay to eat
bread sometimes.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.800
-No! I can't!

07:17.833 --> 07:19.600
You might be able
to eat it just once,

07:19.633 --> 07:21.567
but I'm not strong enough
in moral character.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.800
-Shh.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.200
Just-- You know that
scene in Aladdin,

07:25.233 --> 07:28.200
where Aladdin gives
the orphan kid some bread?

07:28.233 --> 07:29.333
He shares his bread with him?

07:29.367 --> 07:30.567
-Of course.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.167
-Well, that scene makes me
furious, reflecting back
on it!

07:33.200 --> 07:34.267
-(laughing)
-(knocking)

07:34.300 --> 07:35.433
-(dog barking)
-Arnold again?

07:35.467 --> 07:36.800
-You like Arnold.
-Do I?

07:36.833 --> 07:38.633
-Yes!
-Ugh.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.733
(rap music playing)

07:47.267 --> 07:49.833
* Came through in the clutch,
stomping like I'm up
in Loubitons *

07:49.867 --> 07:52.467
* Boys they wanna paint me
like I'm canvas to do sumi on *

07:52.500 --> 07:55.200
-* I hate bottled water
but whatever I'm pouring Evian *
-(laughing)

07:55.233 --> 07:57.667
* I'm the kind of john
closet dudes wanna
go steady on *

07:57.700 --> 08:00.133
* Toss my gems up,
raise the bar. Yung Phenomenon *

08:00.167 --> 08:02.567
* I make a neo-nazi kamikaze
wanna firebomb *

08:02.600 --> 08:04.567
-Hey, now, that's too much!

08:23.233 --> 08:24.533
(coughing)

08:24.567 --> 08:26.000
Ugh.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.900
Are you having fun?

08:28.933 --> 08:31.567
-I'm no expert on fun.
Does it look like
I'm having fun?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.533
-Well, it's impossible
to tell with you.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.067
-Well, let's just
assume I am.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.300
-You're smiling
on the inside.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.767
-Drunk on the inside.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.133
-Oh, well, I suppose
it's better than nothing,
isn't it?

08:42.567 --> 08:43.533
(baby crying)

08:43.567 --> 08:46.267
-Oh...

08:48.567 --> 08:50.767
-We are sure Grace is mine?

08:50.800 --> 08:52.700
-Of course, Alan.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.633
I was already
very pregnant.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.133
Shh.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.300
-Oh, God. Grace was there.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.667
-It was a mistake.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.600
He had pregnant fetish.

09:01.633 --> 09:02.833
It was weird.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.400
He kept talking about
the baby inside me.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.767
-Okay--
-Ugh. I'm not happy
about it either, you know

09:07.800 --> 09:09.067
-Okay.

09:10.433 --> 09:13.033
-Are you okay?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.700
You want a cup of tea
or something?

09:14.733 --> 09:15.733
Or ice cream?

09:15.767 --> 09:17.700
-No, I think
we're out of ice cream.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.200
* Doo-wop,
Doo-wop, wop *

09:23.233 --> 09:27.567
* Doo-wop,
Ooh-a-ooh *

09:27.600 --> 09:29.733
-I'm gonna come out
to my parents.

09:29.767 --> 09:30.833
-Oh, fuck, that's great!

09:30.867 --> 09:32.433
-Yeah, great.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.367
-Terrifying though.
You terrified?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.800
-Terrified.
-Why?

09:35.833 --> 09:38.500
-Uh, Arnold's dad doesn't
really like homosexuals.

09:38.533 --> 09:41.400
-Oh, no. Why doesn't
he like homosexuals?

09:41.433 --> 09:44.767
-I don't know.
He's just so hassled by them.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.067
-Did you just ask why
Arnold's dad doesn't
like homosexuals?

09:48.100 --> 09:49.667
-Oh. Yeah, sorry.

09:49.700 --> 09:52.167
-As if we could pinpoint
why someone's homophobic.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.767
It's not like being scared
of dogs, Tom.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.067
Okay? He wasn't bitten by
a homosexual when he was
a child.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.333
-Um...

09:59.367 --> 10:01.433
Yeah. I just meant, um...

10:01.467 --> 10:04.333
How do we know
that he doesn't like them?

10:04.367 --> 10:06.767
-Um, he said so. A few times.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.233
Once he told me that
I should quit the choir

10:09.267 --> 10:12.400
because the other boys
will think you're a fag
and beat you up.

10:12.433 --> 10:15.267
"It's not worth it, Arnie,
just sing at home."

10:15.300 --> 10:17.667
He might be okay, though.
He's calmed down a bit.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.567
He did grow up in a time
where people thought
different stuff.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.800
-Yeah.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.033
And he really likes you.

10:23.067 --> 10:26.067
You know? That might
balance out how much
he hates queers?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.067
-He does like me.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.300
-It's just going to go great,
isn't it Tom?

10:29.333 --> 10:30.500
It's gonna be fine, yeah?

10:32.367 --> 10:33.533
-Yup.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.767
-I understand. It's not like
I haven't had affairs.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.533
-Alan?

10:41.567 --> 10:43.633
-Not while I've been
with you.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.333
-Oh. Okay.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.533
-I understand.

10:46.567 --> 10:49.600
You know, hormones,
and you were...

10:49.633 --> 10:51.333
I understand. I'm not mad.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.467
-I'm sorry.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.700
-Obviously, I wasn't giving
you enough attention.

10:55.733 --> 10:58.600
-Oh, no. Alan, it's my fault.
It's not you.

10:58.633 --> 11:00.633
-Oh, okay.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.067
-I can make it up to you, huh?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.567
-Please, Mae, don't.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.233
-Oh, come on.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.300
-Mae, uh--

11:11.333 --> 11:13.300
My hands are too soaped up
right now to stop you,

11:13.333 --> 11:15.667
but I really want you
to hear me when I say
I want you to stop.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.833
-No, you don't want me
to stop.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.767
-You're embarrassing yourself!

11:23.533 --> 11:25.167
-I want to do it properly,
at my birthday.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.633
I want to stand up
and announce it.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.167
I have nothing to be afraid of.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.667
-No. Not at your birthday,
not with me there.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.400
No, no. Then they're gonna
think it's my fault.

11:32.433 --> 11:33.400
-Guys...

11:35.067 --> 11:36.600
I really wanna talk
about bread.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.267
-Oh, yeah, Arnold,
you should know the whole time
you've been talking about

11:39.300 --> 11:41.067
this upcoming
pivotal moment in your life,

11:41.100 --> 11:42.800
Tom has just been furious
that you ate the bread.

11:42.833 --> 11:43.900
-I'm still listening.

11:43.933 --> 11:46.633
-Oh, sorry. Did you not want
me to eat your bread?

11:46.667 --> 11:48.233
-No, you can do whatever
you want with bread.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.700
It's just that I choose
not to eat it,

11:49.733 --> 11:52.433
and Josh and I were supposed
to be doing it together,

11:52.467 --> 11:55.767
but then he decided
that his word means nothing.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.767
-Tom thinks bread's poison.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.600
-Why does everyone suddenly
think bread is so bad?

11:59.633 --> 12:00.600
What's so bad about bread?

12:00.633 --> 12:01.700
-Everything!

12:01.733 --> 12:03.700
-There were hot people
in the '90s, they ate bread.

12:03.733 --> 12:06.467
-Arnold, it's...

12:06.500 --> 12:11.067
It's not really about bread.
It's about Josh and...

12:11.100 --> 12:12.567
Well, I'm sorry
for dragging you into it.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.667
It's not your fault.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.633
-You seem actually upset.
Are you actually upset?

12:19.767 --> 12:21.167
-Am not.

12:22.767 --> 12:25.267
-Aww, come on,
cheer up, buddy.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.133
-Yeah, buddy.

12:27.167 --> 12:29.333
Why don't you tell us
about what you're making there?

12:29.367 --> 12:30.467
-None of your business.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.067
-Hey, I'm not mocking you,
I'm genuinely interested.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.300
I'm Team Tom.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.333
-He's making
a little cardboard city.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.333
-Why?

12:39.367 --> 12:41.033
-None of your fucking business!

12:41.067 --> 12:42.500
-He doesn't know why.

12:42.533 --> 12:43.867
-Not yet.

12:43.900 --> 12:48.567
* Doo-wop-wop-wop-wop-wop,
Doo-wop-wop-wop-wop-wop *

12:48.600 --> 12:50.767
-(chickens clucking)
-* Doo-wop-wop-wop-wop

12:50.800 --> 12:53.300
* Wop, Doo-wop

12:53.333 --> 12:57.533
(phone ringing)

12:57.567 --> 12:59.133
-Hey, Ma!

12:59.167 --> 13:01.267
-Hannah ran away!

13:01.300 --> 13:03.233
-What? Where are you?

13:03.267 --> 13:05.833
-Yeah, I'm in a lesbian bar.

13:05.867 --> 13:07.833
-Oh my-- Arnold,
my mum's a lesbian!

13:07.867 --> 13:09.400
-No, I am not--

13:09.433 --> 13:10.667
-She just came out to me.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.067
-Congratulations, Rose!

13:12.100 --> 13:13.833
-I did not. Joshua!

13:13.867 --> 13:17.067
-Well, that is inspiring.
Maybe she can give you
some tips, babe?

13:17.100 --> 13:20.367
She just said,
"Mm-mm, I love the smell
of pussy in the morning!"

13:20.400 --> 13:22.567
-No, I did-- Joshua!

13:22.600 --> 13:25.133
Don't tell them I said that!

13:25.167 --> 13:27.333
-Tell her that her journey's
an inspiration to me.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.667
-Arnold thinks
you've put on weight.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.367
-He did not say that!

13:30.400 --> 13:32.433
-He did. He says you're
a fat, fat, bitch.

13:32.467 --> 13:33.600
-Ugh.

13:33.633 --> 13:35.333
-I don't know why he said it.
It's very disappointing.

13:35.367 --> 13:36.400
-Josh! Oh!

13:36.433 --> 13:38.767
-No, I'm not happy
about it either. You're my mum.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.833
-This isn't funny!

13:39.867 --> 13:42.067
-I don't like that kind of
disrespect about my mum.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.467
-What--
-Where's Hannah?

13:43.500 --> 13:44.800
-I don't know, do I!

13:44.833 --> 13:46.400
That's why I called you!

13:46.433 --> 13:48.267
-Well, I don't know.
Why'd you think I'd know?

13:48.300 --> 13:49.300
I don't know anything.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.100
-Oh, no, I found her,
I found her!

13:54.600 --> 13:56.633
Where have you been?

13:56.667 --> 13:57.700
Hannah!

13:59.367 --> 14:00.533
-Dancing.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.033
-Dancing? Oh.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.367
I have been worried sick!

14:04.400 --> 14:05.800
-Aww...

14:05.833 --> 14:07.533
I thought she might have
been the one.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.333
(phone ringing)

14:14.367 --> 14:15.600
-Hi, Josh, it's Dad.

14:15.633 --> 14:18.300
-What? Dad, you're a lesbian?
-(chuckling)

14:19.767 --> 14:21.467
-Mae's had an affair.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.367
-Oh.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.300
Mae's had an affair.
-(laughing stops)

14:26.333 --> 14:29.500
-No, that is--
That is bad, yeah?

14:29.533 --> 14:32.333
-Yeah, it was just
one night. It's over.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.633
She was pregnant.

14:33.667 --> 14:37.167
-That is-- I'm not sure
I knew that was possible.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.400
-No, it...

14:39.433 --> 14:42.033
Sorry, I probably shouldn't
have burdened you with this.
I'm sorry.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.667
-Don't be sorry.
This is a big thing.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.400
I know. And it's not your fault.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.767
-Well, no.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.600
Do you want me to come round?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.467
Dad?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.133
-Sorry, I...
I shouldn't have called you.

15:05.167 --> 15:09.500
I don't know. I guess I just
needed to... say it out loud
to know that it was true.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.800
And now I have said it.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.133
-Yeah, it's pretty heavy.

15:15.167 --> 15:18.500
-She met him on a pregnancy
fetish page.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.167
-Oh, wow.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.333
-On the bloody Internet!

15:23.367 --> 15:25.067
Sorry, Josh.
I'm gonna go.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.467
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.567
-Can you--
Can you do that?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.700
Straight after having a baby?

15:32.733 --> 15:37.100
Don't you need time
for, like, the vagina?

15:37.133 --> 15:39.633
-It was while
she was pregnant.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.700
-That's bad, yeah?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.500
-It's...

15:44.533 --> 15:46.433
-Is it surprising?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.333
-Tom.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.133
Come on, buddy.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.500
-You are being no fun.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.467
-Does that surprise you?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.700
Oh, for fuck's sake!

15:55.733 --> 15:58.500
If you want to have fun,
introduce yourself
to someone fun.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.100
-Fine!

16:00.133 --> 16:04.200
Yeah, well, it was a dumb idea
that you and I could have
a good time, Hannah.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.733
That-- Let's go.
I'm gonna call a cab.
We're going.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.267
-No, it's fine. We can stay.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.400
-No. You hate being out with me.

16:10.433 --> 16:11.733
-We don't have to go.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.033
-Do you even like me?

16:13.067 --> 16:14.100
-I live with you!

16:14.133 --> 16:15.367
-Now, see!

16:15.400 --> 16:17.733
You can't even say
that you like me!

16:17.767 --> 16:19.300
(phone ringing)

16:19.333 --> 16:21.100
-We could have done this
at home, you know?

16:21.133 --> 16:22.333
-Say that you like me!

16:22.367 --> 16:24.133
-Okay, I like you.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.533
-Okay.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.333
-'Cause I like you too!

16:27.367 --> 16:28.533
-Okay.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.733
-I like you too.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.333
-Good.

16:38.367 --> 16:39.767
-How are you gonna
come out, Arnold?

16:39.800 --> 16:42.033
-Well, I guess I could yell it
from a passing car.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.433
That's how people
tell me I'm gay.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.700
I can flip the system.

16:45.733 --> 16:49.400
-Um, well, I have
some pretty big news, too.

16:49.433 --> 16:53.167
I think I'm gonna come home.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.367
-When?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.700
-I don't know.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.300
I can't afford
to change my flight,

16:57.333 --> 16:59.100
but I can't afford
to keep living here.

16:59.133 --> 17:02.333
-Claire, would you like
to borrow some money?

17:02.367 --> 17:03.767
-Do you have money?

17:03.800 --> 17:04.967
-Yeah, babe.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.233
-Oh my God, well,
that would be incredible!

17:07.267 --> 17:09.800
-Uh, hey, Josh, can you
please fly me to Hollywood?

17:09.833 --> 17:11.500
I just feel like
they need to see me.

17:11.533 --> 17:14.767
-Will you still be able
to afford your special
volumizing shampoo?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.467
-(laughing)
-Yes.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.133
I have budgeted for that.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.733
-What are you going
to ask for in return?

17:19.767 --> 17:21.133
-Oh, make Tom eat bread.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.567
-Yes.
-No, Arnold!

17:22.600 --> 17:23.767
I thought we were a team?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.633
-We're not a team.
-I'm not eating bread.

17:25.667 --> 17:26.500
Wouldn't be right.

17:26.533 --> 17:27.333
-Sorry, Claire.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.167
You have to stay alone
in Germany.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.333
Get used to crying
while eating sausages.

17:32.367 --> 17:33.333
-Look...

17:33.367 --> 17:36.267
I'm happy to eat a piece
of bread for a friend.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.167
It's just that
you're all gonna pretend

17:38.200 --> 17:40.367
like I'm doing
it because you think
I'm in love with her.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.767
-Yeah. Obviously.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.833
-I'm not!

17:43.867 --> 17:44.767
-Arnold?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.500
-That's what I was
planning on thinking.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.533
-Please, Tom?

17:50.633 --> 17:52.667
-Ugh.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.167
-Yes!

17:54.200 --> 17:56.500
-Eating bread!
-(phone rings)

17:56.533 --> 17:58.167
-Mae?
-Josh?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.067
Josh, do you know
where your dad is?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.467
-Dad's missing?

18:01.500 --> 18:03.533
Well, has he got his car?

18:03.567 --> 18:05.833
-Yes, but he left
his wallet and his phone.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.767
I'm scared, Josh.
I think he has run
into the night.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.067
-Oh, no, I mean,
he should not be in the night.

18:12.067 --> 18:12.833
-I did it.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.733
-Josh's dad is missing.

18:14.767 --> 18:15.767
-He's missing?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.500
-It's Mae.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.200
-Oh!

18:21.667 --> 18:22.800
-Who's on the phone?

18:22.833 --> 18:23.667
-Josh!

18:23.700 --> 18:25.567
-What did you call him for?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.167
-Don't bother him
with this!

18:27.200 --> 18:28.300
-He's already bothered
me with it.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.767
-Well, I just couldn't find you.
I thought you ran away.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.833
-I had a swim.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.500
-It's freezing cold outside!

18:33.533 --> 18:34.667
-He had a swim?

18:34.700 --> 18:35.767
-A swim?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.433
-I didn't know
your dad had a pool.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.533
-Hang up!
-What?

18:38.567 --> 18:39.333
-Hang up!

18:39.367 --> 18:41.133
-No, no, don't.
I'll talk to him.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.300
-He want to talk to you.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.100
-No, no.
Tell him to go to sleep.

18:44.133 --> 18:45.400
-He want you
to go to sleep.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.800
-Yeah, well, that has not
been his decision since
I was 11.

18:49.633 --> 18:52.100
-He's stomping away,
up the stairs.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.767
Look, you're not angry
at me, are you Josh?

18:53.800 --> 18:54.900
-No, I'm not angry.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.733
You stuffed up. It's fine.
I get it. People stuff up.

18:56.767 --> 18:58.800
-I canceled our trip
to Thailand, by the way.

18:58.833 --> 18:59.800
-What?
-Canceled it!

18:59.833 --> 19:01.500
-Why did you do that?!

19:01.533 --> 19:02.633
-I don't know.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.467
-Yeah, maybe I will come
and pick him up.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.800
-I told Josh
to come pick you up.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.300
-I mean, I don't want to.
-No!

19:07.333 --> 19:09.167
No, no, no, no, no
no, no, no.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.833
I'm fine. I'm fine!

19:10.867 --> 19:12.833
-I think it's a good idea, Alan.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.467
Maybe you need some space?

19:14.500 --> 19:15.667
-He can pick you up, then.

19:15.700 --> 19:19.200
-I would, but you just went
for a swim in the cold.

19:19.233 --> 19:23.100
And you just canceled
a non-refundable ticket
to see my family.

19:23.133 --> 19:25.133
So, you know, I think,
maybe I should be the one

19:25.167 --> 19:27.033
to look after Grace
tonight, huh?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.467
-All right. All right. Okay.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.133
-Okay.

19:37.833 --> 19:40.733
Dad, Arnold's gonna come out
to his parents this weekend.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.133
-Oh, good on you, mate.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.167
I'm sure they'll be
very happy for you.

19:46.067 --> 19:48.333
-I was thinking,
maybe, um,

19:48.367 --> 19:50.267
you could pretend
to be Arnold's dad,

19:50.300 --> 19:51.700
and Arnold can tell you
that he's gay,

19:51.733 --> 19:53.833
and then you can accept him,
as like, a little practice.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.100
-Oh, no, Josh,
I'm not really in the mood.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.200
-Okay.

19:57.233 --> 19:58.300
Sorry, Arnold.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.133
My dad, he can't even pretend
to accept who you are.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.033
Unacceptable.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.567
-Oh, um, that's cool.

20:12.267 --> 20:13.633
-Okay. Okay.

20:14.867 --> 20:16.633
-Okay. Yeah.

20:21.567 --> 20:23.200
-Um, Dad,

20:23.233 --> 20:26.133
there's really no other
way of saying this.

20:26.167 --> 20:30.100
I wanted to let you know
that, um...

20:30.133 --> 20:32.667
I'm gay.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.067
-Well, that's great news.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.733
Thanks for telling me.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.633
Maybe on the weekend,
you can take me to the shops
and teach me to dress better.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.467
-Sure thing, pal.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.133
-It's just a little stereotypy.

20:46.167 --> 20:47.400
-Mm, I didn't like it.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.267
Nope. I didn't like it,
not one bit.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.067
Nope, nope, nope, nope.
No, I did not like it.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.600
-Did I overact?
-No.

20:53.633 --> 20:54.833
No, I want more.

20:54.867 --> 20:56.367
-Mm, yeah.
-Yeah.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.733
-I wasn't moved.

20:57.767 --> 20:59.367
Claire, were you moved?

20:59.400 --> 21:00.967
-Sorry, I couldn't hear you?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.167
-Arnold, maybe you can cast
your mind back to when
you were in the choir, yes?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.667
-Okay.
-Okay, yeah, sing over there.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.167
And, Dad--
-I don't wanna sing.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.833
-You can play Arnold's dad
learning tolerance.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.367
-Yes, this. We love this.
-Yes.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.100
-I really don't wanna sing.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.067
-Yeah. Oh...

21:15.100 --> 21:16.033
Sorry, Dad.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.600
Yeah, Arnold doesn't want
to cheer you up.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.533
He just doesn't care
about your heart.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.400
-I just don't really think
that it's your choice, Arnold.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.300
-Just there.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.067
-* Party girls don't get hurt

21:38.100 --> 21:41.400
* Can't feel anything,
when will I learn *

21:41.433 --> 21:45.433
* I push it down,
I push it down *

21:45.467 --> 21:46.467
-Wow.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.167
Arnold, you have
a beautiful voice.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.133
-Dad, you idiot!
You're playing his dad now.

21:50.167 --> 21:52.167
Okay? He has an awful voice,
yuck, yuck voice. Come with me.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.567
-* Phone's blowin' up,
they're ringin' my doorbell *

21:55.600 --> 21:58.567
* I feel the love,
I feel the love *
-Okay.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.467
I think you should put on
this hat, yes?

22:00.500 --> 22:02.367
-(plays the piano)
-And then I want you
to go in there

22:02.400 --> 22:03.900
and be disappointed in Arnold

22:03.933 --> 22:07.500
and how he's defying
traditional gender roles
with his nancy-boy singing.

22:07.533 --> 22:10.033
Sit. Grumpy.

22:10.067 --> 22:13.200
Then, as the song changes,
gradually change your mind.

22:13.233 --> 22:16.267
-* One, two, three,
one two, three drink *

22:16.300 --> 22:19.367
* One, two, three,
one two, three drink *

22:19.400 --> 22:22.367
* One, two, three, one two,
three drink *

22:22.400 --> 22:25.633
* Throw 'em back,
till I lose count *

22:25.667 --> 22:31.367
* I'm gonna swing

22:31.400 --> 22:38.300
* From the chandelier,
from the chandelier *

22:38.333 --> 22:40.167
-Dad, this is when you should
start changing your mind.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.833
* I'm gonna live

22:42.867 --> 22:46.767
* Like tomorrow
doesn't exist *

22:46.800 --> 22:50.567
* Like it doesn't exist

22:50.600 --> 22:56.300
* I'm gonna fly

22:56.333 --> 22:59.367
* Like a bird in the night

22:59.400 --> 23:03.067
* Feel my tears as they dry

23:03.100 --> 23:08.833
* I'm gonna swing

23:08.867 --> 23:11.700
* From the chandelier

23:11.733 --> 23:16.633
* From
the chandelier *

23:18.867 --> 23:22.033
-(applauds)
-No, Tom, no. Dad?

23:25.733 --> 23:28.167
-(starts clapping)

23:33.100 --> 23:34.233
-Woo!

23:34.267 --> 23:35.467
-That's my boy.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.033
That's my son.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.467
-Dad...

23:38.500 --> 23:41.267
I'm not sexually
attracted to women.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.167
-I'm proud of you.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.833
Even though you're gay.

23:47.867 --> 23:49.833
Because it doesn't
matter that you're gay.

23:49.867 --> 23:54.133
What matters is that
you're a good person.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.467
It...

23:58.300 --> 24:00.033
-(chuckles)

24:09.600 --> 24:11.233
-Nailed it.

24:11.267 --> 24:13.067
*

24:13.100 --> 24:15.667
-(retching)

24:15.700 --> 24:17.133
It's not coming up.
