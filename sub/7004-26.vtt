00:01.535 --> 00:03.804
Welcome back to Bachelor Week
right here on <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:03.804 --> 00:07.040
If you remember,
yesterday Tim showed us
how to shave in the car

00:07.040 --> 00:08.976
when you're running behind.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.382
Today, it's Al's turn,

00:15.382 --> 00:17.518
with a look at
the rough‐and‐tumble
world of...

00:17.518 --> 00:19.052
Ironing.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.688
Now, ironing used to be
a woman's domain.
But not these days.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.824
Because they won't
do it for us anymore.

00:23.824 --> 00:27.094
More importantly,
a man should know how
to do his own ironing.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.663
Now, I think of an iron
as just another tool.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.832
You can even hang it
from your tool belt.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.834
But you don't want
to plug it in,

00:33.834 --> 00:37.170
'cause there are certain
things you don't want ironed.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.674
Historically, men have been
ironing for ages.

00:40.674 --> 00:44.077
The first irons were made
of iron heated by fire.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.547
This iron here was developed
to be heated by coal.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.215
Then came the nine irons,

00:48.215 --> 00:50.817
your tire irons,

00:50.817 --> 00:53.453
and my personal favorite,
your Jeremy Irons.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.022
He's so wonderful.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.792
All right. Let's get
to ironing technique.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.561
I like to start
with the sleeve

01:00.561 --> 01:02.229
and move on to the body
of the shirt.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.897
Marv, if you want
to come in here.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.301
I also like to start
with a light spray
from my mist button.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.036
Let me show you
how the pros do it.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.404
I'm talking about
the European tailors,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.439
Chinese tailors,
Hong Kong tailors.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.775
Tim Taylors.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.811
We use the old gravity‐feed
professional iron.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.413
Yeah.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.786
1,000 watts,
120 volts, 275 degrees.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.922
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:30.924
I like a little starch
in my shirt,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.526
so I'll starch her up.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.362
Actually, Tim,
too much starch can
irritate the skin.

01:35.362 --> 01:38.398
Yeah. Too much Al
can irritate Tim.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.769
If you iron like Al,
it'll take forever.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.340
European way,
professional way,
do it quick.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.209
Steam going there.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.322
And there you go.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.613
<i>(Brad)</i> My life is over.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.349
Randy, I've got a pimple.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.054
I don't see anything.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.956
It's one of those
under‐the‐skin ones.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.795
It's gonna come out
tomorrow.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.798
Well, maybe we can throw it
a coming‐out party.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.836
Invite all the other pimples
in the neighborhood.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.271
Randy, you don't
understand.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.340
Tomorrow night's my date
with Jessica Lutz.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.142
What am I gonna do?

03:29.142 --> 03:33.280
Send her fries
and a chocolate bar,
hope she breaks out too.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.549
Hey, guys.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.084
Hi, Dad.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.752
I got a pimple
on my nose,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.687
and I got a date
with Jessica Lutz.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.556
Come on. If she's
a real woman,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.524
she's not gonna notice
a little zit on your nose.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.760
She's a 14‐year‐old girl.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.262
You're in trouble.
Big, big trouble.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.131
What works for me
is a hot compress,

03:51.131 --> 03:52.933
you bring the zit
to the surface, you pop it,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.902
ding dong, the zit is dead.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.739
Cool! Come on, Randy,
let's go soak my pimple.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.409
Brad, I'm looking
for a hobby,
but that's not it.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.847
Hi, sweetie.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.682
Hey, baby.
Hi.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.718
You're a little late.
Mm‐hmm. I took my teacher
Judith out for coffee.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.553
Great move!

04:13.553 --> 04:17.491
That'll guarantee you a C,
but if you want the A,
you gotta give cash.

04:17.491 --> 04:21.728
That's not why I'm doing it.
I really like her.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.730
That's great. Anyway,
I'm doing the hot rod.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.133
I got the dash panel up.
Wanna take a look at it?

04:26.133 --> 04:29.870
I just hate knowing
that Judith's going home
to an empty house, though.

04:29.870 --> 04:33.006
A wonderful woman like that
should not be alone.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.211
You know who would be
perfect for her?

04:38.211 --> 04:39.479
Wilson.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.715
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, no!

04:41.715 --> 04:43.583
You keep your filthy little
mitts off Wilson

04:43.583 --> 04:45.252
Admit it, I'm on a roll.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.020
I'm the one who set up
Al and Ilene.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.122
You could have set Al up
with a mop with a wig on,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.925
he would've been happy.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.760
As a matter of fact,
I think you did.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.264
They went to Chicago.
He had a great time
with her.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.765
Wilson is lonely.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.534
I think he likes being alone.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.502
Besides, you just
can't set Wilson up

05:02.502 --> 05:04.337
with some woman
off the street.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.072
She's not just some woman
off the street.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.175
She's faced incredible
adversity.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.010
Her husband left her alone

05:10.010 --> 05:13.180
with two children
and no money when she was
24 years old.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.915
She still managed
to get a Ph. D.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.084
Like that's hard to do.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.720
What exactly
is your problem here?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.722
What exactly do you know
about this woman?

05:22.722 --> 05:24.224
Ph.D., a couple of kids ‐

05:24.224 --> 05:25.892
what about
the important things?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.861
What kind of car
does she drive?

05:27.861 --> 05:30.697
I don't know.
Some sort of station wagon.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.733
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

05:33.733 --> 05:36.670
I dated a station wagon once.
It was a nightmare.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.807
Tim, I'm setting her up
with Wilson, not with you.

05:40.807 --> 05:44.444
Well, if she's lonely,
have her get her own Wilson.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.446
Aha!

05:46.446 --> 05:48.582
I see what's going on here.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.451
You're afraid that
if Wilson spends time
with Judith,

05:51.451 --> 05:54.054
he's not gonna have
any time for you.

05:57.757 --> 06:01.127
If they got married
and went on a honeymoon,
who would I talk to?

06:01.127 --> 06:04.197
It could be a very
difficult week for me.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.837
Well, that's true,
because then we'd
have to talk,

06:10.837 --> 06:15.475
and that would be
a very difficult
week for me.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.449
Hey, Wilson.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.552
Well, hi‐ho, neighborette.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.053
What are you doing?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.555
Well, I'm hanging replicas

06:28.555 --> 06:30.390
of ancient clay bells
from Crete.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
They're supposed to
attract friendly spirits.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.561
What do you know?
Here I am.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.229
<i>(chuckles)</i>

06:36.229 --> 06:38.064
You know, I know we're
supposed to go over

06:38.064 --> 06:39.900
to your house for dinner
tomorrow night,

06:39.900 --> 06:42.035
but I was wondering
if you'd like to come
over to ours instead.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.937
Well, I do appreciate
the invite,

06:43.937 --> 06:48.074
but I've already
made the koftas for
my Malai Kofta curry.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.709
Oh.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.645
I just wanted
to introduce you

06:51.645 --> 06:53.980
to this professor
that I really like.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.982
Well, I have
a cornucopia of koftas.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.851
Why doesn't
the good professor
come over to my place?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.486
That would be great!

06:59.486 --> 07:01.655
You are really gonna
like her, Wilson.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.894
Her?

07:07.894 --> 07:10.764
Yeah. She is incredible.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.167
She's funny, and smart,
extremely attractive,

07:14.167 --> 07:16.303
and extremely available.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.205
Jill, this wouldn't
by any chance be
a setup, would it?

07:19.205 --> 07:24.411
A setup? No. No, no, no.
Definitely not a setup.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.247
Well, I guess it'd be OK,
as long as there's
no pressure.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.983
Absolutely none.
Good.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.953
Although you might wanna
wear those gray slacks

07:32.953 --> 07:35.755
and that blue sweater
that brings out the color
of blue in your eyes.

07:35.755 --> 07:39.059
And you should puff up
your hair, 'cause you
get that hat‐head thing.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.199
Thanks, Dad.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.611
Because of your
hot compress idea,

07:58.611 --> 08:01.614
my zit is the size
of a tomato.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.017
I knew it'd bring
the blood to the surface.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.087
I didn't think it'd make
a permanent home there.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.690
Little kids are gonna
come up to me and think
that I'm a clown.

08:10.690 --> 08:14.260
Come on, Brad, get over it.
They're not gonna do that.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.029
Just in case, maybe
you should practice

08:16.029 --> 08:19.099
making those little
balloon animals.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.533
This is a nightmare.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.602
I'm going out with Jessica
in a half an hour.

08:22.602 --> 08:26.673
OK. This problem
needs a woman's touch.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.942
Brad?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.011
Wake up to makeup.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.248
No, no.
I am not wearing makeup.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.451
If I were you, I'd be
open to suggestions.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.957
Rudolph.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.794
<i>(Wilson)</i> Welcome, Taylors!

08:47.794 --> 08:51.765
My, my, my,
what a lovely bromeliad.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.100
<i>(Tim)</i> Wilson, I'm sorry
Jill roped you into this.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.070
I did not rope him into this.
He's excited.
Aren't you excited?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.671
Well, actually,
I'm quite nervous.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.474
I haven't really
dated in 20 years.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.476
Well, I can give you
some pointers.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.811
Oh, great.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.147
This from the man who,
on our first date,

09:07.147 --> 09:10.683
brought me a bouquet
of spark plugs.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.719
No, really, Wilson.
When you're dating a woman,

09:12.719 --> 09:15.188
they like to hear
stories that tell
how sensitive you are.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.856
I knocked Jill out
with this one

09:16.856 --> 09:18.892
where I saved a little
kitty‐cat drowning
in a river.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.193
Remember that?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.495
You said
it was an old lady.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.732
Kitty‐cat, old lady.
You married me, didn't you?

09:25.732 --> 09:29.636
Don't listen to him.
Just be yourself.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.972
You know, tell her about
all that interesting
stuff that you do.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.842
Well, maybe I could tell her
of the time I was in India

09:35.842 --> 09:38.511
and danced naked
while my body was pierced

09:38.511 --> 09:41.514
by the swords of Siva.

09:41.514 --> 09:45.685
Then again, you don't want
to reveal too much
on your first date.

09:45.685 --> 09:49.956
<i>(gong and panpipe doorbell)</i>

09:54.127 --> 09:56.896
OK, I'll get it.
<i>(Wilson groans)</i>

09:56.896 --> 09:59.699
Oh, my.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.967
Are you OK?

10:00.967 --> 10:04.170
Actually, I'm experiencing
extreme diaphoresis.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.442
I'm sweating like a pig.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.879
Thank you.
Judith, this is
my husband, Tim.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.714
Hello, Judith.
Nice to meet you.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.382
Nice to meet you.
How's Jill at school?

10:16.382 --> 10:18.084
Does she listen to
and follow directions?

10:18.084 --> 10:20.753
Work and play well
with others?

10:20.753 --> 10:24.591
Yes, but she gets
a little rambunctious
during nap time.

10:24.591 --> 10:28.061
You should see her
at home. Whoa!

10:31.798 --> 10:33.967
And this is Wilson.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.035
Well, nice to meet you.
You too.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.272
Jill has told me
so much about you.
It's all been great.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.740
Well, I am flattered.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.076
The only thing she didn't
tell me was your last name.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.745
It's Wilson.
I thought that was
your first name.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.681
Wilson is my first name.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.752
Well...

10:52.752 --> 10:57.624
It's not that unusual.
I'm actually Tim Tim.
This is Jill Jill.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.727
Sorry sorry.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.729
Would you like
some white wine?

11:02.729 --> 11:03.897
Yes, please.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.632
I'll give you a hand.
Sure.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.535
This is a very interesting
house, Wilson.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.904
Or should I
call you "Wilson"?

11:12.805 --> 11:15.275
Judith, in addition
to being my professor,

11:15.275 --> 11:18.211
mentor, friend, is also
a renowned author.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.314
Oh, hardly renowned.
My book sold about
four copies.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.816
Two of which were
to my children.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.518
I wrote a book once.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.388
<i>How To Maintain</i>
<i>Your Bench Grinder.</i>

11:29.556 --> 11:31.925
That sold no copies.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.893
Well, it was probably more
exciting than my book.

11:33.893 --> 11:37.997
It was called
<i>The Psychophysiological Indices</i>
<i>of Amorous Connections...</i>

11:37.997 --> 11:40.900
<i>Among Termites</i>
<i>of the Southwest.</i>

11:40.900 --> 11:42.936
How did you know that?

11:42.936 --> 11:47.207
Because I have read it.
It is wonderful!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.908
I mean, it's practically
the Bible

11:48.908 --> 11:51.644
for anyone interested in
the mating pattern of insects.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.247
All two of you.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.551
You see,
I am quite the devotee

11:58.551 --> 12:01.554
of what I humorously term
"insexuality."

12:01.554 --> 12:03.756
<i>(Judith laughs)</i>

12:03.756 --> 12:05.725
I can't believe
you actually read my book.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.560
I've got it right here.
I'll show you.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.662
We'll have to talk
some insects over dinner.

12:09.662 --> 12:14.234
Yeah. 'Cause usually
over here we eat
insects for dinner.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.035
<i>(Wilson)</i> Here it is.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.807
You even dog‐eared the pages.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.875
Now it's my turn
to be flattered.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.444
<i>(chuckles)</i>

12:28.414 --> 12:30.950
I gotta start
a dating service.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.991
♪ You made me love you
I didn't want to do it

12:37.991 --> 12:40.760
♪ I didn't want to do it

12:40.760 --> 12:44.497
♪ You made me want you
And all the time you knew it

12:44.497 --> 12:47.133
♪ You know you really knew it

12:47.133 --> 12:50.603
You're darn right...
<i>(sings)</i> ♪ I knew it

12:50.603 --> 12:51.604
Well, hi‐ho, Tim.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.239
Hi, there, Wilson.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.675
I haven't seen much of you
in the last couple of weeks.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.144
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with Judith.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.446
As a matter of fact,
I'm sculpting her bust
right now.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.521
So things are going
pretty good, huh?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.123
Oh, they are incredible.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.593
As the Japanese would say,
Judith has become my <i>aijin.</i>

13:13.593 --> 13:16.195
I don't follow.
Well, as they'd say
in Tanzania,

13:16.195 --> 13:19.332
Judith has become
my <i>rafiki yangu mpenzi.</i>

13:20.600 --> 13:24.604
In America, near Detroit,
what would they say?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.607
They'd say
I am crazy about her.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.742
You know, Tim, I'd love
to stay and chat,

13:29.742 --> 13:31.444
but I have to make
dinner tonight.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.112
I promised Judith
something romantic.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.747
Like oysters?
No, I'm making haggis.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.550
It's a sheep's stomach
served dumpling‐style.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.953
Mmm.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.628
Hey!
Hi, sweetie.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.163
Great news.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.966
Wilson is making Judith's
breasts out of clay.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.268
What?

13:55.268 --> 13:58.271
You were right about them.
He's crazy about her.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.006
Oh, no.

14:00.006 --> 14:04.877
What do you mean, "Oh, no"?
This is what you wanted.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.546
I've just been
talking to Judith.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.648
She's having serious doubts
about the relationship.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.084
Oh, no.

14:11.084 --> 14:16.155
Judith says that Wilson
has a problem with intimacy.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.290
Oh!

14:17.290 --> 14:21.394
So he can't...
Oh. Oh, God. Oh!

14:21.394 --> 14:22.528
Oh!

14:22.528 --> 14:24.697
Well... Oh, honey!

14:24.697 --> 14:26.799
I mean, I would have
never known.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.102
He wouldn't talk about
something like that.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.270
No wonder he's got
all this...

14:31.270 --> 14:33.039
Probably an old war injury
or something, huh?

14:33.039 --> 14:37.744
Not that kind of intimacy!
I'm talking about
emotional intimacy.

14:37.744 --> 14:41.447
Thank God it's nothing
important. Whoo!

14:43.616 --> 14:45.151
He doesn't share
his feelings.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.320
She's spent every day
the last two weeks with him,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.088
and she doesn't know
who he is.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.658
I've spent the last
15 years with him,
and I don't know who he is.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.327
It doesn't hurt
our relationship.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.163
I think she wants something
more from the relationship.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.098
She wants to go
to the next level.

14:59.098 --> 15:02.735
What is it with you women
and the "next level"?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.771
What's wrong with
the level we're on?

15:04.771 --> 15:08.808
Just take the elevator
and leave us
the heck alone. Hmm?

15:08.808 --> 15:10.643
Every time she asks him
about himself,

15:10.643 --> 15:12.478
all he does
is intellectualize

15:12.478 --> 15:14.180
or say something weird.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.848
He always says
something weird.

15:15.848 --> 15:19.018
That's what makes
Wilson Wilson Wilson.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.691
I think you should
talk to him.
No, I'm not ‐

15:25.691 --> 15:27.460
You're the only one
that's got a chance
of getting through to him.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.497
I'm supposed to go
talk to that man about
emotions and intimacy?

15:31.497 --> 15:33.733
Granted, you're not
the obvious choice.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.068
But desperate times call
for desperate measures.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.471
If he doesn't
open up to her,
he is gonna lose her.

15:42.308 --> 15:46.612
<i>(grunting)</i> OK, moving
to the next level.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.780
Wilson, you home?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.882
I'm in the kitchen, Tim,
making my haggis.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.350
Hey. <i>(sniffs)</i>

15:51.350 --> 15:53.986
You know, that stuff
doesn't smell half‐bad.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.988
Pretty excited about having
Judith over for dinner?

15:55.988 --> 15:57.323
Oh, yes, indeed.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.292
You really like her?
Oh, yes.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.094
Oh, no. Oh.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.096
Tim, is there something
you want to tell me?

16:04.096 --> 16:06.766
No, there's something
Jill wants me to tell you.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.201
Uh...

16:08.201 --> 16:10.236
Judith is having a problem.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.205
What kind of a problem?
Is she all right?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.073
Oh, she's fine.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.577
The problem is with you.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.513
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.748
We even made plans to go
to the Megalesia Festival

16:22.748 --> 16:26.085
to commemorate
the end of the Punic War.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.123
She... She says
that ‐ that ...

16:31.123 --> 16:33.159
She told Jill that
she doesn't even
think she knows you.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.628
That every time she tries
to get you to open up

16:35.628 --> 16:37.296
you just say something
intellectual.

16:37.296 --> 16:40.399
Oh, my, my, my.
I must be displaying
the symptomatic behavior

16:40.399 --> 16:42.835
of the classic male
emotional distancer,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.638
precipitating her
to overfunction
in the relationship,

16:45.638 --> 16:48.441
therefore causing
deep‐seated resentment.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.177
So knock it off.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.981
Tim, I don't take easily
to personal or emotional
revelation.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.782
No guy does.
Opening up emotionally

16:56.782 --> 17:00.386
is just a horrible thing
women make us do.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.623
Well, Tim, I'm just not sure
that I can do that.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.199
Yes, you can.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.967
Just use
the word "feel" more.

17:14.967 --> 17:18.471
You know, like,
"I feel hungry."
"I feel tired."

17:18.471 --> 17:21.607
"I feel big." "I feel small."
"I feel bloated."

17:21.607 --> 17:25.177
Tim, I think that Judith
and I weren't meant to be.

17:25.177 --> 17:28.681
To be or not to be,
that is not the question.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.585
You've got to learn
how to open up to this woman,

17:32.585 --> 17:34.453
otherwise you're gonna be
all by yourself

17:34.453 --> 17:36.756
at that milk of magnesia
festival.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.130
So, are you enjoying
your haggis?

17:44.130 --> 17:47.166
It's very tender.
What's in this?

17:47.166 --> 17:50.269
That is sheep's liver
and other assorted organs.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.238
It's very filling.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.641
These are lovely candles.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.777
Mm.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.112
Well, thank you.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.182
You know, I've always
found it fascinating
how a candle burns.

18:03.182 --> 18:06.252
The hot flame moves downward,
thus melting the wax,

18:06.252 --> 18:09.555
which rises through the wick
through capillary action...

18:11.257 --> 18:13.159
Oh, boy, that was dull.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.598
Wilson, I think
we should talk.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.433
I know what you're
gonna say, Judith.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.201
I haven't been
very open to you.

18:22.201 --> 18:25.438
I don't understand why a man
who can talk brilliantly
about anything

18:25.438 --> 18:28.074
can't tell me about the one
thing I really want to know.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.713
Well, my family never
really talked much
about personal matters.

18:33.713 --> 18:38.050
Especially my father,
Wilson Wilson Sr.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.388
What was he like?

18:42.388 --> 18:44.290
He was a scientist

18:44.290 --> 18:47.360
who didn't put too much
stock in emotions.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.129
Must have been very
difficult to grow up
with a man like that.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.331
Mm. It was.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.967
You know,
I loved my father.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.171
It always hurt me when
he kept me at a distance.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.308
And the last thing
I ever wanted was
to be like him.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.043
But you're not.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.712
You believe that
feelings matter.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.817
I know that, because I see
the way you care about mine.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.359
You know, Judith...

19:20.359 --> 19:25.598
I've never been
open with a woman
since my wife died.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.334
But I would really like
to try with you.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.436
I'd like that too.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.576
Well, maybe we can
talk about it tomorrow

19:37.576 --> 19:39.779
at the Megalesia Festival.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.481
If you still want to go.

19:42.481 --> 19:47.119
I wouldn't want to celebrate
the end of the Punic War
with anyone else.

19:47.119 --> 19:51.157
Even though I have
absolutely no idea
what the Punic War was.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.792
Well, actually,
it's fascinating.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.628
It was when Rome
saved itself by...

19:55.628 --> 19:58.330
Oh, who the hell cares?
They'll have beer.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.872
You know, Judith,
not to bore you
with more facts...

20:12.111 --> 20:13.779
...but primitive man believed

20:13.779 --> 20:17.149
that the air he breathed
had magic powers.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.452
I'm not bored.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.989
And when a man
and a woman kissed,

20:23.989 --> 20:27.126
it was as if their souls
were mingling.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.359
Oh, look, Mark.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.928
It's the sister
we've always wanted.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.932
Hello, Bradina.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.901
Laugh all you want.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.536
But I've been going out
with Jessica for two weeks,

21:10.536 --> 21:13.072
and she hasn't
noticed one zit.

21:13.072 --> 21:17.409
Yeah, but that doesn't
explain the lipstick
and the mascara.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.013
Well, I dumped out
all Mom's makeup.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.848
Which do you think
covers my zits better?

21:22.848 --> 21:25.785
Bashful Beige
or Nearly Nude?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.221
This is too weird.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.490
<i>(doorbell)</i>
I got it!

21:33.392 --> 21:35.027
Hi. Is Brad here?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.897
Yeah. He's in the kitchen,
putting on his makeup.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.138
Hey, Brad.

21:49.842 --> 21:53.779
Hey, Jessica!
What are you doing here?

21:53.779 --> 21:55.447
I, um...

21:55.447 --> 21:57.783
I just thought
maybe we could go
to practice together.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.385
Well, um...

21:59.385 --> 22:03.222
Brad, are you trying
to cover up that zit
on your chin?

22:05.558 --> 22:09.161
Oh, man. I knew I should
have gone with Bashful Beige.

22:12.665 --> 22:18.070
No. No, I think
that Bashful Beige
is too dark for you.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.106
You'd look better
in Posy Pink.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.809
I think I have that.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.148
All right. Now, guys,
you need to remember

22:29.148 --> 22:32.084
to apply it gently
and blend thoroughly,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.619
because you always want

22:33.619 --> 22:36.555
that natural
boy‐next‐door look.

22:40.326 --> 22:45.097
There you go. Good job.
