00:10.711 --> 00:13.381
( theme music playing )

00:38.472 --> 00:40.374
Murray:
ITEM ONE:
"SLOW SONGS."

00:40.474 --> 00:43.377
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA IF YOU ENDED
EACH GIG WITH A SLOW SONG.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.379
NO. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY SLOW SONGS.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.449
SO THAT'S A CLEAR "NO"
FROM YOU, BRET.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.785
NOW, JEMAINE, WHAT IF
YOU WERE TO SLOW DOWN
SOME OF YOUR OWN BITS?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.155
'CAUSE YOU DO
DIFFERENT SONGS
THAN BRET, DON'T YOU?

00:54.255 --> 00:57.391
- HMM?
- WELL, YOUR SONGS,
THEY'RE A LOT--

00:57.491 --> 00:59.827
NO, THEY'RE THE SAME SONGS,
THEY'RE JUST A DIFFERENT PART.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.496
- I PLAY THE BASS.
- OKAY, WELL, I'M NOT
THE MUSICIAN, ALL RIGHT?

01:02.596 --> 01:04.498
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.634
I'M JUST THE BRAINS
BEHIND THIS OPERATION.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.304
MURRAY, I WAS THINKING
WE SHOULD PLAY SOME GIGS
IN BIGGER VENUES.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.940
( sighs )
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A SMALL VENUE, BRET,

01:13.040 --> 01:14.742
ONLY SMALL BANDS.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.611
THE CAMPER-VAN GIG WAS
TOO SMALL, 'CAUSE NO ONE
COULD GET IN THERE.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.547
THERE WAS JUST
THAT ONE OLD MAN
AND HIS WIFE.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.549
WHOA WHOA WHOA,
THIS WAS THE CAMPER-VAN GIG

01:21.649 --> 01:24.285
THAT WAS SOLD OUT
IF I'M CORRECTLY MISTAKEN.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.320
HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU GET TO BE SOLD OUT?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.189
IT'S THE SMALL VENUES--
THAT'S THE TRICK.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.857
- YEAH, WELL--
- IT'S A TRICK.
IT'S AN OLD TRICK.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.360
AND NO MORE RAFT GIGS.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.062
- IT SOLD OUT.
- YES, IT WAS ANOTHER
SOLD OUT GIG,

01:35.163 --> 01:37.698
- BUT WE WANT
TO DO BIGGER GIGS.
- OKAY, I GET THE PICTURE.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.434
ITEM TWO: "FRIENDS."

01:40.534 --> 01:43.003
NOW WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR QUITE SOME TIME

01:43.103 --> 01:44.605
IN THE PROFESSIONAL REALM,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.807
I'D LIKE
TO PUSH THINGS FORWARD
IN THE FRIENDSHIP REALM.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.610
- WHAT'S THE FRIENDSHIP REALM?
- WELL, YOU'VE HEARD OF A REALM?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.412
- MMM.
- YEAH?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.013
- YES.
- WELL, THIS IS LIKE
A FRIENDSHIP ONE.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.815
A GROUP OF PEOPLE
BASICALLY GETTING TOGETHER

01:54.915 --> 01:56.650
CALLING
EACH OTHER FRIENDS.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.453
LOOK AT THIS.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.656
RIGHT. OKAY.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.526
- WHAT'S THIS?
- IT'S A FRIENDSHIP GRAPH.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.262
OKAY, IF YOU HAVE
A LOOK ALONG HERE
ON THE X-AXIS,

02:08.362 --> 02:10.798
THIS REPRESENTS
TIME PASSING

02:10.898 --> 02:12.633
AND ON THE Y-AXIS HERE,

02:12.733 --> 02:15.203
THIS IS THE DIFFERENT
LEVELS OF FRIENDS, OKAY?

02:15.303 --> 02:17.338
STARTING UP HERE
WITH "FRIENDS,"

02:17.438 --> 02:19.940
"WORKMATES,"
DOWN TO "COLLEAGUES,"

02:20.040 --> 02:23.577
UNDERNEATH THAT, "STRANGERS"--
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE
I'VE NOTICED--

02:23.677 --> 02:24.745
AND THEN "ENEMIES."

02:24.845 --> 02:27.481
SO BASICALLY YOU GUYS
ARE HERE-- "WORKMATES"--

02:27.581 --> 02:30.518
AND WHAT I WANT IS
TO GET YOU UP HERE--

02:30.618 --> 02:33.321
"FRIENDS" AND ABOVE.
THAT'S WHERE JIM IS.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.989
- WHO'S JIM?
- JIM'S MY BEST FRIEND.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.659
- WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF JIM.
- WELL, IF YOU GUYS
WERE MY FRIENDS,

02:38.759 --> 02:41.462
YOU'D KNOW WHO
MY OTHER FRIEND WAS-- JIM.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.897
MURRAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
THE NEW IMMIGRATION REPORT?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.335
- GREG, DO YOU
THINK OF US AS FRIENDS?
- I HOPE SO, MURRAY.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.703
WE'RE NOT.
WE'RE COLLEAGUES.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.673
- I SEE.
- I'M YOUR BOSS.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.876
- WOULD YOU LIKE
THE REPORT, MURRAY?
- UH, YES.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.279
NOW CAN YOU FAX
THAT TO ME?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.749
OKAY.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.618
SEE, GUYS? I DON'T LET
JUST ANYONE BE MY FRIEND.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.821
GREG'S A GOOD GUY, BUT HE'S
IN COLLEAGUE STATUS.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.158
SO I THINK THE THREE
OF US ARE READY TO MOVE ON

03:11.259 --> 03:13.694
AND GET TO THAT NEXT LEVEL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, GUYS?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.429
UH, OKAY.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.865
JEMAINE,
FRIENDS POSSIBILITIES?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.200
- OKAY, MAN.
- YEAH, MAN.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.870
WHAT'S THE TIME, MAN?
AW, HECK.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.439
YOU GUYS HAD BETTER GO--
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GIG.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.877
- ( elevator dings )
- ( folk music playing )

03:29.977 --> 03:31.912
* WHO LIKES
TO ROCK THE PARTY? *

03:32.012 --> 03:33.381
* I LIKE
TO ROCK THE PARTY *

03:33.481 --> 03:35.249
* WHO LIKES
TO ROCK THE PARTY? *

03:35.349 --> 03:36.650
( whispering )
SOUNDS GOOD, GUYS.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.652
SLOW IT DOWN A BIT.
THESE TWO ARE DANCING.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.723
POSSIBLE COUPLE HERE...
DANCING TO THIS.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.726
( dings )

03:46.694 --> 03:48.362
WELL, YOU'VE LOST
THE AUDIENCE.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.197
OH, IT'S THE BOTTOM FLOOR.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.933
ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
FUTURE FRIENDS.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.107
OH, THERE'S MEL.
GO GO GO.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.276
- HEY! HEY, GUYS!
- ( bike bell ringing )

04:02.376 --> 04:04.812
HEY, JEMAINE!
HEY, BRET!

04:04.912 --> 04:07.915
( singsongy voice )
I HAVE SOME COOKIES
FOR YOU IN MY FANNY PACK.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.517
HMM?

04:09.617 --> 04:12.553
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.989
OH, LOOK, THIS ONE
MUST BE FOR BRET--
THAT'S BRET'S--

04:16.089 --> 04:18.792
- AND HERE'S JEMAINE'S.
- YUM.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.162
UH, I'M NOT SURE I WANT
TO EAT MY OWN FACE.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.332
I ALMOST DID
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.700
THE LIPS ARE
VERY PROMINENT.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.936
YEAH. YUP.

04:29.036 --> 04:33.040
OH, THAT REMINDS ME:
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT
YOU GUYS LAST NIGHT.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.009
JEMAINE, YOU WERE A SLAVE

04:36.109 --> 04:37.845
STRIVING TOWARDS FREEDOM.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.047
AND BRET--

04:40.147 --> 04:43.817
WELL, I JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.988
- UH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
- I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE
SO FLEXIBLE.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.358
( sighs )

04:50.458 --> 04:51.592
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD MEAN?

04:51.692 --> 04:53.827
DO YOU THINK THAT
IT MIGHT BE CLAIRVOYANCE

04:53.927 --> 04:56.930
AND I CAN SEE
INTO THE FUTURE
WHEN I SLEEP?

04:57.030 --> 04:59.900
- UH, WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD GET GOING.
- OH, YEAH YEAH YEAH.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.437
WOULDN'T IT BE FANTASTIC
IF THE WORLD WAS MORE
LIKE YOUR DREAMS?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.005
- NO.
- YEAH.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.106
DO YOU THINK SO,
JEMAINE?

05:06.206 --> 05:09.042
YEAH, SOME--
SOME DREAMS.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.479
* WHY CAN'T THE WORLD

05:11.579 --> 05:15.048
* BE MORE LIKE
IN MY DREAMS? *

05:15.148 --> 05:18.251
BYE!

05:18.352 --> 05:20.388
* IT WOULD BE FULL

05:20.488 --> 05:24.792
* OF ALL OF MY
FAVORITE THINGS *

05:27.428 --> 05:29.530
* THE SUN SHINING
IN THE SKY *

05:29.630 --> 05:32.065
* AND SUDDENLY
I CAN FLY *

05:32.165 --> 05:33.734
* I'M A LITTLE BIRD
UP HIGH *

05:33.834 --> 05:36.570
* IN A V FORMATION
WITH MY FAVORITE GUYS *

05:36.670 --> 05:38.806
* I'M AMELIA EARHART

05:38.906 --> 05:41.241
* MY PLANE HAS
A BROKEN WING *

05:41.341 --> 05:43.544
* MY FELLAS ARE
MY PROPELLERS *

05:43.644 --> 05:46.079
* AND MY COOKIES
START TO SING *

05:46.179 --> 05:48.549
* WHY CAN'T THE WORLD

05:48.649 --> 05:52.019
* BE MORE LIKE
IN HER DREAMS? *

05:52.119 --> 05:54.488
I AGREE.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.024
* I WON'T TELL MY SECRETS
TO FOREIGN SPIES *

05:57.124 --> 05:59.026
* AND THEN RESCUED BY
MY TWO FAVORITE GUYS *

05:59.126 --> 06:01.829
* I'M INSTANTLY PREGNANT
AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN *

06:01.929 --> 06:03.664
* AND WHEN THEY POP OUT,
THEY'RE LIKE BRET
AND JEMAINE *

06:03.764 --> 06:06.500
* I'M WALKING TO SCHOOL,
FOLKS ARE STARING AT ME *

06:06.600 --> 06:09.236
* THEN I LOOK DOWN,
I'M COMPLETELY NAKED! *

06:09.336 --> 06:12.105
* WHAT IF THE WORLD

06:12.205 --> 06:15.943
* WAS MORE LIKE
IN MY DREAMS? *

06:32.593 --> 06:34.862
* I WAKE UP
EARLY IN THE MORNING *

06:34.962 --> 06:37.197
* GO TO SCHOOL
AND DO A TEST *

06:37.297 --> 06:39.533
* THEN ALL MY TEETH
FALL OUT *

06:39.633 --> 06:42.169
* AND I'M FALLING
TO MY DEATH *

06:42.269 --> 06:44.538
* WHY CAN'T THE WORLD

06:44.638 --> 06:49.610
* BE MORE LIKE
IN MY DREAMS? *

06:53.046 --> 06:54.848
- PARDON?
- WHAT?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.484
WE'D BETTER GO, MEL.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.652
- THANKS FOR THE COOKIE.
- OH, YEAH.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.221
- SEE YOU, MEL.
- BYE.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.691
( theme music playing )

07:07.360 --> 07:09.396
WELL, THIS IS FUN,
ISN'T IT, GUYS?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.765
- YES.
- BRET?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.434
- PRESENT.
- NO, YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY "PRESENT."

07:14.535 --> 07:18.572
- WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
- IT'S JUST A CASUAL,
RELAXED ATMOSPHERE.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.041
- YEAH.
- OKAY, I SEE.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.645
FORGET ABOUT ALL THE WORK
FORMALITIES WE NORMALLY
HAVE WHEN WE'RE WORKING.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.147
OH, I'VE GOT YOU
SOME LISTS.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.751
JUST SOME IDEAS FOR THINGS
WE COULD DO AS FRIENDS.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.220
ITEM ONE:
"MAKE A COFFEE."

07:33.320 --> 07:36.223
ITEM TWO:
"COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR DAYS."

07:38.125 --> 07:39.627
UH, THREE:
"WATCH A DVD."

07:39.727 --> 07:42.329
I'VE BROUGHT
"THE WORLD'S FASTEST INDIAN."

07:42.429 --> 07:45.365
OH, GREAT.
DO YOU HAVE IT ON DVD?

07:45.465 --> 07:49.236
YUP. ITEM FOUR:
"BUILD A FORT."

07:49.336 --> 07:51.171
- BUILD A FORT?
- YUP.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.940
AND AT THE END HERE
I'VE GOT

07:53.040 --> 07:54.975
"EXPRESS OUR EMOTIONS"
AND "HAVE A BEER."

07:55.075 --> 07:56.810
WELL, THAT SHOULD BE AROUND
THE OTHER WAY, ACTUALLY--

07:56.910 --> 07:58.579
WE'LL HAVE A BEER
THEN WE'LL EXPRESS
THE EMOTIONS.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.747
MURRAY, WE DON'T
EVEN DRINK BEER.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.682
WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT OUR EMOTIONS.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.951
WELL, THAT'S THE SORT
OF STUFF I DO WITH JIM.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.287
- WHO'S JIM?
- JIM, MY FRIEND JIM.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.356
- WE'RE NOT JIM.
- NO.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.959
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- WHAT SORT OF THINGS
DO YOU LIKE TO DO?

08:12.059 --> 08:15.596
WELL, I LIKE HAVING
A BATH, BUT--

08:15.696 --> 08:16.964
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE A BATH, BRET.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.699
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S
SOMETHING I LIKE DOING.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.101
I LIKE
TO HAVE A SLEEP.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.205
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL PUT
THAT ON THE LIST.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.508
"HAVE A SLEEP."

08:28.609 --> 08:30.477
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL DO?

08:30.578 --> 08:32.646
WELL, IT'S WHAT
YOU LIKE TO DO, IS IT?

08:32.746 --> 08:35.849
SO YOU CAME AROUND HERE
TO HAVE A SLEEP?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.318
WELL, I'LL PROBABLY
CHOOSE SOME OF THE OTHER
THINGS BEFOREHAND.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.888
THAT'S LAST
ON THE LIST.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.227
BRET, DON'T SHINE
THE LIGHT IN MY EYES--

08:47.327 --> 08:48.696
YOU'LL RUIN
MY NIGHT VISION.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.798
MURRAY,
THIS IS CHILDISH.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.000
Murray: WHAT,
YOU THINK BUILDING
A BIVOUAC IS CHILDISH?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.135
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
- THIS IS WHAT WE USED TO DO
IN THE NEW ZEALAND ARMY.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.970
DO YOU SEE CHILDREN
IN THE ARMY, JEMAINE?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.640
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- WELL, ACTUALLY YOU DO,
BRET, IN SOME ARMIES,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.909
BUT NOT THE GOOD ONES,
NOT THE NEW ZEALAND ARMY.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.377
- NOT BY THE TIME
I GOT IN THERE.
- WERE YOU IN THE ARMY?

09:04.477 --> 09:07.447
YEAH. REMEMBER I SHOWED
YOU MY NEW ZEALAND
ARMY UNIFORM--

09:07.547 --> 09:08.849
THE GREEN T-SHIRT
AND THE GREEN SHORTS?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.684
OH, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOUR UNDERWEAR.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.253
NO, ALL THE NEW ZEALAND ARMY
SOLDIERS WORE THEM,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.255
AND WE'D BUILD
BIVOUACS LIKE THIS

09:15.355 --> 09:17.658
OUT OF ANY SORT
OF RESOURCES THAT
CAME TO HAND.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.028
WHAT, OUT OF TWO BROOMS,
SOME BLANKETS
AND THE BEDS?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.596
NO, NOT BEDS.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.932
IT DEPENDS WHAT
WE HAD, YOU KNOW, HANDY.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.167
SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU'RE IN THE BUSH,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE BROOMS.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.936
YOU USED TWIGS
AND LEAVES.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.271
YOU'D BE IN THE BUSH
FOR DAYS ON END,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.240
RELYING ON NOTHING
BUT YOUR WITS.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.543
- OH.
- AND ONE TIME...

09:36.644 --> 09:38.912
MY WHOLE PLATOON HAD
TO DRINK THEIR OWN URINE.

09:39.012 --> 09:42.482
- OH, WERE YOU LOST?
- NO, WE WERE DRUNK.
IT WAS A PARTY GAME.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.686
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE
THAT PART OF THE ARMY.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.488
- MORE TEA, JEMAINE?
- NO THANK YOU, MURRAY.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.524
- I MIGHT GO TO BED.
- OH, OKAY.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.127
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
TO BED TOO THEN.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.029
- SEE YOU, GUYS.
- GOOD NIGHT, MURRAY.

09:56.129 --> 09:59.166
Murray:
BRET, I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.902
- AND, JEMAINE, YOU'RE OUR DAD.
- Jemaine: GO TO SLEEP, MURRA.

10:02.002 --> 10:06.206
Murray:
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.
GOOD NIGHT, GRAEME.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.779
THIS IS A DEFINITE MOVE UP
ON THE Y-AXIS, GUYS.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.148
( folk music playing )

10:16.750 --> 10:18.919
( rocks splashing )

10:25.358 --> 10:27.695
( people chatting on TV )

10:50.283 --> 10:53.020
RIGHT, LET'S HAVE
A LOOK AT THE GRAPH.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.724
UP WE GO.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.627
OH, GUYS,
WE'VE DONE IT.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.831

THE NEXT LEVEL.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.398
( projector clicks )

11:07.701 --> 11:10.470
I THINK YOU'RE
READY TO MEET JIM.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.807
- WHO'S JIM?
- JIM-- MY BEST FRIEND.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.776
COME ON, WE'RE ON
THE SAME LEVEL NOW.

11:15.876 --> 11:20.047
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THE FRIEND AGENDA--
THE AFRIENDA.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.117
OH, HERE WE GO:
THERE'S A BARBEQUE
AT MY PLACE TONIGHT.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.287
PERFECT.
WE HANG OUT
LIKE FRIENDS,

11:27.387 --> 11:29.790
LIKE THE FRIENDS
FROM THAT PROGRAM "FRIENDS."

11:29.890 --> 11:32.059
I COULD BE CHANDLER,
THE FUNNY ONE.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.461
JEMAINE,
YOU COULD BE ROSS,
THE MOPEY ONE.

11:34.561 --> 11:38.766
AND BRET--
JOEY, THE NAIVE ONE.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.468
- CAN I BE CHANDLER?
- NO, I'M CHANDLER.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.803
BUT I'M MORE
LIKE CHANDLER--

11:42.903 --> 11:45.205
I SAY WITTY THINGS.
I HAVE WITTICISMS.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.140
- NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE MOPEY.
- YEAH, I'M SARCASTIC.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.276
I WOULD JUST SAY
SOMETHING SARCASTIC

11:49.376 --> 11:51.311
AND YOU'D NOT REALLY NOTICE,

11:51.411 --> 11:54.647
BUT THE PEOPLE WATCHING
WILL REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.785
JIM KNOWS ME
AS THE CHANDLER GUY.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.821
( knife scrapes )

12:05.492 --> 12:06.994
IT'S A PRETTY QUIET
PARTY, MURRAY.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.996
IT'S ONLY
JUST STARTED, JEMAINE.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.497
LOOK AT BRET.
HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.068
HEY, BRET,
YOU THINK IT'S ROCKING NOW,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.604
YOU WAIT TILL JIM GETS HERE--
IT'S GONNA BE TWICE THIS.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.308
- HE'S LIKE A ONE-MAN PARTY.
- WELL, DOES HE NEED US THEN?

12:21.408 --> 12:24.011
OH, YEAH. JUST TO GIVE YOU
AN EXAMPLE OF THE SORT

12:24.111 --> 12:26.113

12:29.082 --> 12:30.583
JEMAINE AND I KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE, DON'T WE?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.685
- AMERICANIZED THOUGH.
- THEY'RE BREASTS.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.388
- YOU SEE THE BREASTS?
- OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS
A MONSTER...

12:35.488 --> 12:37.390
- NO NO, THEY'RE BREASTS.
- ...WITH BIG EARS.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.892
NO, IT'S A NAKED
WOMAN'S BODY.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.994
OH, DEFINITELY.
AS SOON AS I SAW IT
I THOUGHT, "YEAH."

12:41.094 --> 12:42.562
OH, WE SHOULD PLAY
A JOKE ON HIM.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.933
- OKAY. LIKE WHAT?
- YOU GUYS TELL HIM

12:46.033 --> 12:48.168
THAT I FOUND YOU
IN THE BUSH

12:48.268 --> 12:49.803
AND I BROUGHT YOU BACK
INTO THE CITY--

12:49.903 --> 12:51.171
I CARRIED YOU BACK
INDIVIDUALLY.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.705
WHAT WERE WE DOING
IN THE BUSH?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.007
YOU WERE DROPPED
IN THERE.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.177
YOU WERE LEFT BY YOUR--
YOUR PARTNERS.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.513
- GIRLFRIENDS?
- YEAH, YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
LEFT YOU IN THE BUSH.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.351
YOU MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG.
YOU MUST'VE UPSET THEM.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.856
- SEEMS FAR-FETCHED.
- OH, HE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.292

13:54.902 --> 13:56.703

FEEL FREE TO GO
GET A DRINK OR MAKE
YOURSELVES AT HOME,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.789
GET COMFORTABLE.
WE'LL BE BACK IN
ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.025
( dings )

15:26.193 --> 15:28.528
BRET, I DREAMT
ABOUT YOU AGAIN.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.398
- HMM?
- ACTUALLY, I'M KIND OF
ANGRY AT YOU

15:31.498 --> 15:34.101
FOR SOMETHING YOU DID
IN MY DREAM LAST NIGHT.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.668
YEAH, YOU WERE
THERE TOO, JEMAINE,

15:35.768 --> 15:37.770
BUT YOU DID
SOMETHING VERY NICE.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.240
- AH. HMM.
- Bret: OH, THAT'S NICE.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.443
BUT, BRET, I JUST--
I FEEL LIKE--

15:43.543 --> 15:46.079
IT'S SILLY,
BUT YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.481
- APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?
- Jemaine: WHAT DID HE DO?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.517

15:52.285 --> 15:55.488
OH! OH MY GOD.
WHAT WAS THE NICE THING
THAT I DID?

15:59.159 --> 16:02.429
- OH! OOH.
- YEAH.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.365
- WHAT DID I DO?
- I DON'T WANT
TO SAY, BRET,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.767
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY APOLOGIZE.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.702
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE.
IT WAS A DREAM.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.605
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT SEEMED REAL, DIDN'T IT?
- IT SEEMED LIKE YOU.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.574
- DID I APOLOGIZE
IN YOUR DREAM?
- Both: NO, YOU DID NOT.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.309
THAT'S A SHAME.
I SHOULD'VE APOLOGIZED
IN THE DREAM.

16:16.409 --> 16:19.279
YOU BASTARD.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.615
- YOU BASTARD, BRET.
- APOLOGIZE.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.053
I'M SORRY.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.655
- OKAY.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.760
- ( beeps )
- Jim: Hey, Bret, Jemaine.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.795
It's your
new friend Jim.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.697
I was just calling
to see if you guys wanted
to go out tonight.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.367
Give me a call.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.469
- SHOULD WE CALL HIM?
- NO.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.404
- I THINK I SHOULD.
IT'S POLITE.
- WHAT FOR?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.240
- HE'S OUR FRIEND NOW.
- HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.342
HE'S JUST A GUY
WHO WE MET ONE TIME.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.978
- I'LL CALL HIM BACK.
- OH, DO-- OH, PLEASE--

16:52.079 --> 16:54.314

17:10.363 --> 17:12.965
OH. WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT MY MESSAGE?

17:13.066 --> 17:16.703
UM, WELL, I-- YEAH,
I LIKED YOUR MESSAGE.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.406

UM, YEAH, WELL--

17:28.481 --> 17:30.183
( whispering )
HE'S SAYING "SHALL WE GET
TOGETHER SOMETIME?"

17:30.283 --> 17:32.018
- WHAT SHOULD I SAY?
-( whispering )
NO. SAY NO.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.987
UM... NO.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.325
OH, WHY NOT?

17:38.425 --> 17:40.927
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE HE'S A DICK.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.096
BECAUSE...

17:43.196 --> 17:46.166
WE'RE BUSY--
JUST REALLY BUSY
AT THE MOMENT.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.001
DID JEMAINE
JUST CALL ME A DICK?

17:49.102 --> 17:51.771
UM... DID YOU JUST
CALL HIM A DICK?

17:51.871 --> 17:54.541
- YEAH.
- UM, YES.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.277
- BRET, DON'T TELL HIM THAT!
- WELL, YOU JUST TOLD ME
TO TELL HIM!

17:57.377 --> 17:59.812
BRET, I DIDN'T SAY
TO TELL HIM HE'S A DICK.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.182
- UH, ARE YOU STILL--
ARE YOU STILL THERE, JIM?
- YES, HE IS A DICK.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.585
- YEAH, I'M STILL HERE.
- SORRY, THAT WAS--

18:05.685 --> 18:07.387
- AM I ON SPEAKERPHONE?
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.756
- BUT-- I GOT CONFUSED...
- ABORT THE CALL.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.392
- ...'CAUSE I THOUGHT--
- That's all right.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.961
I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET TOGETHER. OKAY.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.997
- BYE, BRET.
- Bye.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.767
WELL, HE DOESN'T SOUND
VERY HAPPY ABOUT YOU
CALLING HIM A DICK.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.669
YOU-- ARGH!

18:26.639 --> 18:30.543
- ( ping-pong ball clacking )
- ( phone ringing )

18:32.579 --> 18:35.182
- TABLE'S NOT
REALLY WIDE ENOUGH.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?!

18:35.282 --> 18:37.650
- TABLE TENNIS.
- GUYS, THIS IS NO GOOD.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.287
I NEED
MY DESK TO WORK ON.
THIS IS MY WORKSPACE.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.322
IT'S NOT A REC CENTER
FOR THE MISGUIDED.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.891
WHAT IF SOMEONE
WAS TO COME IN NOW
AND SEE THIS MESS?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.359
WELL, THEN WE CAN
PLAY DOUBLES.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.261
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO AWAY.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.597
I THOUGHT WE'D GONE
TO THE NEXT LEVEL--
FRIENDS LEVEL.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.166
WELL, WE ARE, BRET,
BUT WE CAN'T HANG OUT
ALL OF THE TIME,

18:53.266 --> 18:55.535
NOT HERE AT MY WORK.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.537
I'M AFRAID THIS IS A DROP
IN THE Y-AXIS, BRET.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.772
- A DROP?
- YEAH.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.642
CAN YOU NOT PUT IT
ON THERE? JUST 'CAUSE
IT'S THE TABLE-TENNIS TABLE.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.045
RIGHT, WE'VE DROPPED
RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
OF FRIENDS NOW.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.080
BUT WE THOUGHT
YOU REALLY LIKED US.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.649
YOU CAN STILL WORK
ON THE DESK.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.185
YOU JUST HAVE TO
IGNORE US, I SUPPOSE.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.922
JEMAINE, PLEASE GO AWAY.
GO AWAY, GUYS.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.459
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.694
LOOK, I'LL MAKE IT UP
TO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

19:21.794 --> 19:25.097
WE'LL GO ORIENTEERING
WITH JIM ON SATURDAY.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.100
- OH. NO, THAT'S OKAY.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.803

19:33.840 --> 19:35.608
- SEE YOU LATER, MURRAY.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.182
MURRAY,
I FORGOT MY JOCK AGAIN.
DO YOU GOT AN EXTRA ONE?

19:43.283 --> 19:45.552
I'VE ONLY GOT
ONE JOCK, JIM.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.355
- ( locker rattles )
- OH, HEY, GUYS.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.690

19:55.462 --> 19:57.297
- OH, HELLO, GUYS.
- OH, YES.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.798
- Bret: HEY, MEL.
- HI.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.568
- HEY, MEL.
- WHY-- WHAT'S MEL
DOING HERE?

20:01.668 --> 20:04.337
I THOUGHT WE COULD
BRING A FEMALE ELEMENT
INTO OUR GROUP

20:04.437 --> 20:06.172
LIKE THEY DO
ON THAT PROGRAM "FRIENDS."

20:06.273 --> 20:10.209
SHE COULD BE LIKE
THE KOOKY FEMALE,
YOU KNOW-- PHOEBE, IS IT?

20:10.310 --> 20:13.045
- OH, YEAH, SHE'S GREAT.
- WHO WOULD JIM BE THEN?

20:13.145 --> 20:14.747
YOU COULD BE--
WE'LL, WE'VE GOT ROSS.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.749
- Jemaine: I'M ROSS.
- YOU'RE ROSS.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.451
- YOU WERE GONNA BE JOEY.
- Jemaine: I'LL JUST
STAY AS ROSS.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.653
YOU'D HAVE TO BE, UM...

20:20.753 --> 20:23.656
- MONICA?
- YEAH.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.626
- IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
BUT... UH...
- Jim: COOL.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.895
YOU KNOW, I DREAMT ABOUT YOU
AGAIN LAST NIGHT, BRET.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.498
- Murray: IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE YOU HERE, MEL.
- YOU KNOW, MURRAY,

20:31.598 --> 20:34.867
I WOULD REALLY
LOVE TO LEARN HOW
TO ATTACK A MAN.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.704
UNFORTUNATELY,
TAE KWON DO IS MORE
ABOUT SELF-DEFENSE.

20:37.804 --> 20:41.140
OKAY, JEMAINE, COME AT ME
WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.809
- ( both grunting )
- ( Jemaine thuds )

20:42.909 --> 20:45.345
- Jemaine: AH! AH!
- Murray: SORRY, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.414

- Murray: MEL!

20:47.514 --> 20:49.248
- ( Bret grunting )
- Murray: MEL, STOP IT! MEL!

20:49.349 --> 20:51.418
Mel:
OH, GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.355
Jemaine:
ONE TWO THREE FOUR.

20:55.455 --> 20:59.726
- AH. AH.
- ( elevator dings )

21:03.563 --> 21:06.833
- COME ON, JIM.
- HI, JIM.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.068
- HEY, JIM.
- HI.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.238
( dings )

21:12.339 --> 21:14.774
JEMAINE,
DID YOU CALL
JIM A DICK?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.377
NO. NO, I DIDN'T.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.979
NO. I WOULD NEVER
CALL JIM A DICK.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.881
- HE DID.
- I KNEW IT.
YOU DID.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.484
JIM WOULDN'T TELL ME--
THAT'S NOT IN HIS NATURE--

21:24.584 --> 21:26.218
BUT I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG,

21:26.319 --> 21:29.522
SO I GOT HIM DRUNK
AND HE TOLD ME THAT
YOU CALLED HIM A DICK.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.691
YEAH. WELL,
BRET CONFIRMED IT THOUGH.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.694
- YEAH, I DID.
- IS THAT TRUE, BRET?
YOU CONFIRMED IT?

21:34.794 --> 21:37.330
- UH, YES.
- I SAID IT QUIETLY
ON THE PHONE

21:37.430 --> 21:39.332
AND BRET COULD'VE
JUST EASILY COVERED OVER

21:39.432 --> 21:41.033
AND SAID SOMETHING
THAT RHYMED WITH DICK...

21:41.133 --> 21:43.002
- LIKE WHAT?
- ...LIKE A TICK.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.605
Murray:
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, JEMAINE.
HE'S NOT A DICK OR A TICK.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.207
AND, BRET,
YOU CAN'T CONFIRM
THAT HE'S A DICK.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.509
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
CALL ME A DICK.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.843
I DO CALL YOU
A DICK SOMETIMES.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.445
- SAME.
- I'VE CALLED YOU
A DICK BEFORE.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.013
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ANOTHER
ISSUE WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.682
- HE HAS CALLED YOU A DICK.
- MORE TO THE POINT, GUYS,

21:55.782 --> 21:57.917
JIM IS A COOL GUY.
AREN'T YOU, JIM?

21:58.017 --> 22:01.388
- YES.
- YOU'RE THE DICK IN
THIS SCENARIO, JEMAINE...

22:01.488 --> 22:02.889
- ME?
- ...FOR CALLING JIM
A DICK. YES.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.825
HOW DOES THAT FEEL,
A TASTE OF YOUR OWN
DICK MEDICINE?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.462
I JUST-- YOU KNOW,
I WISH COULD ALL
HAVE GOT ON.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.098
FRIENDS SHOULD BE FRIENDS
OF FRIENDS' FRIENDS.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.333
I TRIED, MURRAY.
I CALLED.

22:14.434 --> 22:18.004
- I ASKED QUESTIONS.
- I HATE TO THINK HOW THIS IS
GOING TO LOOK ON THE CHART.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.839
LET'S REVIEW IT.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.609
OKAY, SO THIS IS,
I GUESS, WHERE I GAVE
YOU THE BAD REVIEW.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.176
AND THEN--
LOOK AT THIS--

22:24.276 --> 22:27.514
A REALLY BIG DROP
BECAUSE YOU GUYS
NEARLY GOT ME THE SACK.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.483
- YEAH. YEAH.
- THAT'S A BIG DROP
IN THE Y-AXIS.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.452
Jemaine:
BUT WE CAME
TO VISIT YOU IMPROMPTU.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.722
- OKAY, THAT WAS KIND OF NICE.
- AND WE MADE YOUR OFFICE
A GAMES ROOM.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.190
- WAS THAT NICE? WAS IT?
- Jemaine: YEAH, WE PUT
IN TABLE TENNIS.

22:38.290 --> 22:41.027
I DON'T THINK SO, GUYS,
BECAUSE YOU DRILLED
HOLES IN MY DESK.

22:41.127 --> 22:44.664
- FOR PUTTING THE NET UP.
- YEAH WELL, WHAT ABOUT TABLE-
TENNIS NETS WITH CLAMPS?

22:44.764 --> 22:47.834
- OH, THE CLAMP ONES.
- YEAH. SO THAT'S DOWN AGAIN.

22:47.934 --> 22:51.270
- AND THEN JEMAINE
CALLED ME A DICK.
- I CALLED HIM A DICK, SO--

22:51.370 --> 22:52.905
RIGHT, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S DOWN AGAIN.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.675
OH, YOU'RE BELOW COLLEAGUES.
YOU'RE BELOW GREG--

22:55.775 --> 22:59.579
WORSE THAN WHEN WE STARTED.
CLASSIFICATION: STRANGERS.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.281
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOU GUYS ANYMORE.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.816
SO WE'RE NOT
FRIENDS ANYMORE?

23:03.916 --> 23:07.186
NO, BRET, NOT ACCORDING
TO THE CHART.

23:07.286 --> 23:08.821
HOW'S MY CHART, MURRAY?

23:08.921 --> 23:10.423
JIM, THERE'S YOUR ONE.
LOOK AT THAT.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.659

23:12.759 --> 23:15.261
- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. YEAH

NICE ONE.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.963
WHERE DO YOU BUY
YOUR MARKERS?

23:17.063 --> 23:19.231

FROM STATIONERY.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.033
OH, HERE WE GO.

SO SEE YOU TOMORROW...

23:29.676 --> 23:32.211
- OKAY.
- ...BUT WE'LL BE--
WE'LL BE STRANGERS,

23:32.311 --> 23:33.580
SO THAT'LL BE
UNCOMFORTABLE.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.048
JUST COME AND GIVE
YOUR NAMES AT THE DESK.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.818
