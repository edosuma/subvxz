WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:03.237
-GILES: Previously.
-SPIKE: You never had it
 so good as me.

00:03.270 --> 00:07.408
If you tell anyone
about last night,
I will kill you.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.579
So you three have-- what?
Banded together to be
pains in my ass?

00:11.612 --> 00:14.147
We're your "archnemesises."

00:14.182 --> 00:17.150
You may have beaten us
this time, Slayer,
but next time,

00:17.184 --> 00:19.387
maybe not.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.725
Amy? How've you been?

00:25.759 --> 00:27.561
Rat. You?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.230
-Dead.
-Oh.

00:29.263 --> 00:33.201
It's nice, having another
magically inclined
friend around.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.069
It's way too early
to go home yet.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.070
-So what do you wanna do?
-I have a better idea.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.905
Is it dangerous?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.207
Let's get out of here.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.109
-(Tires Screeching)
-(Screams)

00:42.143 --> 00:44.112
Dawnie, I'm sorry.
I'm so--

00:44.145 --> 00:46.713
-You could have
killed her.
-I need help.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.582
No more spells.
I'm finished.

00:49.616 --> 00:52.585
There's some money stuff
we're gonna have
to talk to you about.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.387
So you're telling me I'm broke?

00:54.421 --> 00:57.691
-How bad is it?
-Anya says pretty bad.

00:57.725 --> 01:02.695
Buffy, some discussion
about, um, what you're
going to do now.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.599
Um, I've been giving that
a lot of thought, actually,

01:05.632 --> 01:07.168
and I think I've figured it out.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.938
Now, I get Warren being
a super-villainy type,

01:11.971 --> 01:15.209
but I thought Jonathan
completely learned
that lesson.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.545
I've never even heard
of this other guy.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.048
You should have seen their
headquarters. It was like
the nerd natural habitat.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.251
Well, if we know where they are,
shouldn't we do something?

01:24.284 --> 01:27.420
We tried.
Buffy was gonna go in there
and bust 'em on the spot.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.391
-I'm sensing
a not-so-completely.
-Yeah, well, she went in and--

01:31.424 --> 01:33.894
Speaking of Buffy,
isn't she ready? She's gonna
be late for her first day.

01:33.926 --> 01:36.764
Hey, respect the narrative
flow much?

01:36.796 --> 01:39.500
Please continue
the story of failure.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.137
So, Buffy went in,
but they'd cleared out.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.338
Then she brought back
the stuff that they left--

01:45.372 --> 01:48.676
some spell books,
some parchments,

01:48.709 --> 01:53.313
a couple of rare things,
charmed objects
and a conjuror's harp.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.783
And they had other stuff,
you know--

01:56.817 --> 01:59.753
Razor scooters and pictures
of the Vulcan woman
on Enterprise.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.656
Ooh!
(Chuckles)

02:03.656 --> 02:06.126
I mean, nerds.

02:06.159 --> 02:09.697
Okay.
See, this is why demons
are better than people.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.699
Interesting turn.

02:11.731 --> 02:15.336
When I was a vengeance demon,
I caused pain and mayhem,
certainly.

02:15.368 --> 02:19.606
But I put in a full day's
work doing it, and I got
compensated appropriately.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.211
Welcome to today's episode
of Go, Money, Go.
I hear it daily.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.878
Yep, for the rest
of your life.

02:25.913 --> 02:30.783
But super-villains
want reward without labor,
to make things come easy.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.354
It's wrong. Without labor,
there can be no payment
and vice versa.

02:34.388 --> 02:39.627
The country cannot progress.
The workers are the tools
that shape America.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.030
Good to know.
I was kinda feeling like a tool.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.033
And now I know why.

02:49.236 --> 02:52.840
(theme music plays)

03:43.656 --> 03:46.960
NARRATOR: You've seen us
 in your city or small town
 across the American West.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.195
You've ordered
 our delicious food
 from our happy employees.

03:49.228 --> 03:53.033
But now you're seeing it all
 in a new way. You're seeing it
 from behind the counter,

03:53.066 --> 03:57.871
because you've just become part
 of the Doublemeat experience!
I'm part of it!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.872
I'm part of it.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.042
I'm a part of it too.

04:02.074 --> 04:04.544
NARRATOR:
 This cow and this chicken
 don't know it yet,

04:04.578 --> 04:06.879
but they're destined to
 become part of it as well.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.817
So what happens when a cow
 and a chicken get together?

04:09.849 --> 04:11.919
Why, that's
 a Doublemeat Medley!

04:11.951 --> 04:15.522
Let's take a look now
 at the process of harvesting
 these two special meats.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.425
(Mooing, Clucking)
 (Slaughtering Noises)

04:22.362 --> 04:24.365
Holy crap.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.002
NARRATOR: Washing your hands
 thoroughly after each visit
 to the restroom.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.305
Follow these rules,
 and you'll be a happy part...

04:32.340 --> 04:35.643
of the Doublemeat family
 for a long time!

04:38.778 --> 04:40.848
Interesting, isn't it?

04:40.880 --> 04:44.752
Oh, yes. Like how
the cow and the chicken
come together...

04:44.784 --> 04:47.187
even though
they've never met.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.990
It's like Sleepless in Seattle
if-- if Meg and Tom were,
like, minced.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.529
I'm Manny the manager.
It's not a joke.
It's just my name.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.367
Right. You mentioned that
a couple of times...

04:59.399 --> 05:01.601
when I filled out
the application.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.004
Why do you want
to work here, Buffy?

05:04.036 --> 05:07.107
You seem like a sharp
young woman, and there
are a lot of other jobs.

05:07.139 --> 05:11.144
Well, I-I kind of need money
pretty quickly-- like, today.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.514
So, I didn't want to go through
a lengthy interview process,

05:13.547 --> 05:17.184
and I figured this was probably
the fastest way... to--

05:17.216 --> 05:21.521
Because I wanted to be part
of the Doublemeat experience?

05:21.555 --> 05:25.057
Mmm. Come on.
Let's take a tour.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.398
Phillip, Timothy, this is Buffy.
She's gonna work the counter.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.399
Hi.

05:32.432 --> 05:35.067
What happened to
the other one-- Katherine?

05:35.101 --> 05:37.670
-Emily?
-Yeah.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.007
She's gone.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.875
What happened?

05:42.909 --> 05:44.944
Whatever always happens.

05:47.279 --> 05:49.516
You can use this one.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.351
Uh, there's someone's
stuff in there.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.855
They must've left it.

05:54.887 --> 05:58.225
-You can toss it
or keep what you want.
-Sure they're not coming back?

05:58.257 --> 06:00.694
We have a lot of turnover here.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.997
Watch these two.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.867
Are they gonna do something?

06:06.899 --> 06:09.870
They're solid.
Follow their example,
and you won't go wrong.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.372
-They're lifers.
-Lifers?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.608
In it for life. Like me.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.511
You want to get something
out of this, Buffy,
you'll do the same.

06:17.545 --> 06:21.915
You put the work in,
and 10 years from now,
you'll be where I am,

06:21.949 --> 06:24.985
I promise you.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.990
Congratulations.
You're on the clock.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.566
This is the kitchen,
the beating heart
of the Doublemeat Palace.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.374
Wow.
They're all so identical.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.543
Yeah, they all start
to look the same to me too.

06:50.577 --> 06:54.247
Oh, no.
Not the employees,
the chicken slices.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.560
MAN OVER SPEAKER:
Medley Meal number two,
double-size it,

07:06.593 --> 07:09.062
Drive-through station's
over there.
and a shake.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.398
High pressure job.
You won't need to go in there.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.901
Over there is the grill,
the fryers, the walk-in freezer.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.303
You don't need
to go in there either!

07:19.872 --> 07:22.175
That's the dehydrated
pickle storage.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.512
Those are locked.

07:25.545 --> 07:29.249
-Now I want to show you this.
-WOMAN OVER SPEAKER:
Two Double Medley Juniors.

07:29.281 --> 07:34.221
Uh, no tomatoes.
Look.
The Doublemeat Medley.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.091
Oh, I know the Medley.
It's just,

07:39.125 --> 07:42.262
uh, the video
was kind of graphic,
with the slaughter.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.165
A classic double-decker
with a twist.

07:45.197 --> 07:47.466
A pure beefy patty
above the mid-bun,

07:47.500 --> 07:50.437
and a slice of
processed chicken product
below the mid-bun.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.341
Plus pickles
and the secret ingredient.
Eat it.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.177
Oh, you know,
I had a big breakfast.

07:57.209 --> 07:59.680
I'll just wait for--

08:01.180 --> 08:05.819
Oh. But it smells so good.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.855
(Resigned Sigh)

08:11.858 --> 08:16.062
Mmm. So, what is
your secret ingredient?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.199
It's a meat process.

08:19.231 --> 08:21.668
Now I think it's time
to start earning your money.
Don't you, Buffy?

08:22.935 --> 08:24.872
Mm-hmm.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.542
So, what's the deal
with Manny the manager?

08:28.576 --> 08:31.310
If I ask him really nice,
can I write a children's book
called that?

08:31.343 --> 08:33.581
Fill this while
I get the fries.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.985
Fill this? I didn't know
there was gonna be
drug testing on this job.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.721
-You're funny.
You better stop that.
-Why?

08:41.754 --> 08:44.356
Productivity--
one of Manny's watchwords.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.259
"Levity is the time thief
that picks the pocket
of a company."

08:47.293 --> 08:49.361
I prefer the one that goes,

08:49.395 --> 08:52.365
"Manny's a humorless dolt
who picks the pocket
of he-should-bite-me."

08:52.399 --> 08:56.604
You really need
to be quiet with that.
Here you go.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.272
Thanks.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.109
I'd like a small coffee
and cherry pie.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.413
That's $1.92, ma'am.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.517
You hit so many buttons.
It was like Buttonpalooza.

09:10.549 --> 09:15.688
No, it's easy. I-- Look.
There are little pictures
of the food on the buttons.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.692
I hit the coffee button,
then I hit the small button,
and then cherry pie.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.193
There's a picture
of a little fried pie.

09:21.227 --> 09:25.197
Uh-huh.
Then I hit
the total button.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.934
I put the money
in the drawer, I close it,
and it resets the system.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.570
A cocker spaniel
could do it.

09:30.604 --> 09:34.274
Here, why don't you take
the next one, the family.
They're regulars.

09:34.307 --> 09:38.077
Hi. I'm new.
I come here every day.

09:38.110 --> 09:42.548
That's nice.
Oh, you really
might make it, dear.

09:42.581 --> 09:46.754
Not like some of them,
where suddenly you never
see them again.

09:46.787 --> 09:51.591
I can see you here
for a long time.
That's great.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.193
Thank you.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.499
Hi. Welcome to
the Doublemeat Palace.
May I help you?

09:59.532 --> 10:03.003
Yeah. We need
two number four Medley Meals,
a Junior Medley,

10:03.035 --> 10:06.505
a Fisherman's Medley with bacon,
and a kid's meal,
plus three fries,

10:06.538 --> 10:09.876
a chocolaty shake,
and extra pickles
on one of the Medleys.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.849
Excuse me.
Um, this button--

10:15.883 --> 10:18.518
Does it look
chocolaty to you?

10:35.903 --> 10:40.407
WOMAN OVER SPEAKER:
Let me have two Double Medleys--
(Continues, Indistinct)

10:46.746 --> 10:49.182
You don't need
to be in there.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.684
Sorry.
I was just curious.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.520
Curiosity killed
the cat.

10:56.556 --> 11:00.360
Theory number five:
cat burgers.

11:00.393 --> 11:04.496
MAN:
Thanks a lot. Okay. I got it.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.634
Hey, Buffy!

11:08.668 --> 11:11.705
We're here to support your
subsistence-level employment.
Bravo.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.508
-Thank you.
This is cool of you guys.
-So, Buff, how's it going?

11:15.542 --> 11:17.576
I don't know.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.580
I've waitressed before,
but... this is different.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.182
Uh, when have
you waitressed?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.418
That summer in L.A.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.520
It was a diner, and we had,
you know, lots of people
who didn't tip,

11:28.554 --> 11:31.024
and funny, funny
health-code violations,

11:31.057 --> 11:34.360
but it wasn't
like it is here.

11:34.394 --> 11:38.999
I think there's
something wrong here.
Wil, are you okay?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.870
Sorry, I-I-- Yeah.
Uh, something's wrong.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.238
There's-- There's
this manager, right?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.539
And he's all scary
and mysterious, you know?

11:47.573 --> 11:49.676
And there's this
secret ingredient.

11:49.709 --> 11:54.047
And the people that work here,
they're-- they're kind of
strange. You know?

11:54.081 --> 11:57.216
They just--
just stare into space.
Plus, they disappear.

11:57.250 --> 12:01.687
-Disappear, poof?
-No, not poof.
Well, I don't think so.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.591
It's fast food.
I have swum these
murky waters, my friend.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.195
There's the assorted creepiness.
There's staring.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.697
There's the enthusiastic
not-showing-up-at-all.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.932
I think you're seeing demons
where there's just life.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.735
I didn't say demons.
It's just a vibe.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.206
I mean, you guys still
haven't seen this manager.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.375
Well, isn't that him over there,
getting the pickles wet?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.645
-Yeah, with the saddle shoes.
-WILLOW: And the glasses.

12:26.678 --> 12:29.548
I don't know.
Maybe it's just the video
that's creeping me out,

12:29.581 --> 12:31.650
with the cow and the chicken
all swirly together.

12:31.683 --> 12:35.388
Mmm. Make me hungry,
why don't ya?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.091
How's about one of those
delicious Medley Meals?

12:38.125 --> 12:41.494
Okay, you got it. On me.

12:41.528 --> 12:46.165
Hey, thanks. See, I think
she'll be fine when she settles
into the routine.

12:46.198 --> 12:49.269
And by ordering,
I'm helping.
And getting a free meal?

12:49.302 --> 12:52.438
-Well, yeah.
-Well, if you like
the food here, honey,

12:52.471 --> 12:54.774
maybe we should get it
for the reception.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.509
You're serving burgers?
Cool. Heh!

12:57.543 --> 13:01.313
Well, time is running
very short. After Willow gave us
the "whoosh" engagement party,

13:01.347 --> 13:03.682
I got slack on the planning,
'cause I figured she'd help.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.019
But, well, now that's all
been blown to hell.

13:06.052 --> 13:10.023
Hey, standing right here.
Standing right exactly here.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.359
Sorry.
Didn't mean to tempt you.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.328
(Whispering)
That one's so delicate.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.764
Anyway, I still have to select
the bridesmaids' dresses,

13:18.798 --> 13:22.668
and, well, then there are
the guests from out of town and
the ones from the demon realm.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.837
You wouldn't believe
how many of them have yet
to let us know either way.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.774
There you go.
And I double-sized it for ya.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.976
Oh, thank you.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.779
And cut way back
on the cat.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.182
-Cat?
-Just kidding.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.852
-(Chuckles)
-Probably.

13:49.428 --> 13:51.730
Slow night.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.769
(Sighs)
Gina.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.475
Since it's slow,
you think they'll mind
if I take another break?

14:02.509 --> 14:06.712
We're not allowed.
Downtime robs us all.

14:06.745 --> 14:10.182
Hm. Thus quoth Manny.
There's no one here.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.952
Sure there is. Look.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.159
This'll make
my day complete.

14:20.192 --> 14:24.163
(Sighs) What?
What's in
the Doublemeat nuggets?

14:24.197 --> 14:28.868
I'm working. Go away.
Yeah, and you chose to be in
the consumer service profession,

14:28.902 --> 14:30.937
and I'm a consumer.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.040
Service me.
Order something or go.

14:34.073 --> 14:38.077
Give a bloke a chance
for his eyes to adjust.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.779
Damn fluorescent lights.
They make me look dead.

14:40.812 --> 14:45.351
Some demons love 'em.
The way they vibrate
makes their skin twitch.

14:45.384 --> 14:49.522
That the kind of demon
you are, love?
I am not a demon.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.960
I don't know why
you can hit me,
but I'm not a demon.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.961
Oh.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.963
I see.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.566
That why you took this job?

14:59.599 --> 15:03.802
Prove something to yourself.
A normal job for a normal girl.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.639
Good way to drive
yourself crazy, that is.
I'll be fine.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.480
Buffy.

15:14.846 --> 15:16.950
You're not happy here.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.885
Please don't
make this harder.

15:19.918 --> 15:23.456
You don't belong here.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.458
You're something--
You're better than this.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.794
I need the money.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.398
I can get money.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.633
Walk with me now.
Come on.

15:33.665 --> 15:37.470
I-- I need to go help
Gary with the fries.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.639
You gotta get out of here.
This place'll do stuff to you.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.476
This place'll kill you.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.653
(Indistinct Rumbling)

15:54.687 --> 15:56.822
Someone there?

15:56.855 --> 16:01.160
Oh, hey. What are you doing?
What-What--
(Screaming)

16:11.138 --> 16:14.073
(Sighs)
Feels like I just left,
you know?

16:16.342 --> 16:18.644
You came back.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.048
I came back.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.552
(Sighs)

16:28.654 --> 16:32.325
(Gasps)
Gary's gone.

16:32.359 --> 16:36.363
Gary? Oh, the guy
that helped me out at
the counter yesterday?

16:36.395 --> 16:38.465
He didn't show up
this morning.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.301
Well,
shift's just starting.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.404
He was supposed to unlock
early this morning.
Didn't show.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.740
Pull his card.

16:47.774 --> 16:52.078
Well, I-I'm sure, you know,
he's just late. He didn't
seem like he was leaving.

16:52.111 --> 16:55.481
I'm moving Timothy to counter.
You're on grill.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.985
Me?
I've been watching you.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.653
But I-- I don't know
how to grill.

17:01.687 --> 17:07.294
Just think-- This is
the last day you'll
ever be able to say that.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.767
You put the beef on the grill.
You hit the button.
Then it beeps.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.871
You flip the beef,
hit the other button.
Then it beeps.

17:18.904 --> 17:22.509
You put it on the bun.
There's not a button for that.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.611
Repeat until insane.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.082
It eliminates variation.

17:31.317 --> 17:34.121
Every burger at every
Doublemeat Palace
is the same.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.057
People don't like variation.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.792
Got it.
Variety is the spice of bad.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.894
Hmm.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.367
So, what's
the secret ingredient?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.970
It's a meat process.

17:51.002 --> 17:54.141
Well, what does that mean?

17:54.173 --> 17:57.210
It's a process.
They do it to the meat.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.278
But what is it?

17:59.311 --> 18:01.580
It's just the name
of the process.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.083
Oh. Yeah.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.118
(Beeping)

18:08.421 --> 18:11.958
So, I guess we're gonna
get kind of greasy, huh?

18:11.990 --> 18:14.594
PHILLIP: Hmm.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.297
Skin, hair,

18:18.631 --> 18:21.433
eyelashes,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.470
nostrils,

18:24.636 --> 18:26.638
inside your ears.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.809
You wanna look
inside my ears?

18:32.644 --> 18:35.815
No. No, that's okay.

18:35.847 --> 18:39.951
Once I noticed I couldn't hear
and went to the doctor.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.323
He said it was grease.
It made a plug.

18:44.856 --> 18:46.792
Oh.
Mmm.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.496
And I got me a kit,
a kit for cleaning my ears.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.199
It's got this
little bulb mechanism.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.768
Heh. Imagine that.
(Chuckling)

18:55.801 --> 18:57.936
Yeah.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.807
MANNY: Buffy.
Yay. It's Manny.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.443
You're working
a double shift.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.880
What?
Another eight hours?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.317
Right after
these eight hours?

19:10.349 --> 19:13.152
But that's...
so many hours.

19:13.185 --> 19:16.989
You get paid for it,
plus an extra free
Doublemeat Medley.

19:17.022 --> 19:20.125
What happened?
Why the double shiftiness?

19:20.159 --> 19:23.630
Gary didn't show,
and now one of my
grinder guys is late too.

19:23.663 --> 19:28.201
But they could still
show up, right? I mean,
they could be anywhere.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.404
Your meat's here.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.574
Okay. Bye.

19:34.606 --> 19:38.144
An, that was Buffy.
She's working late,
so I might have to go-- Yike!

19:38.176 --> 19:42.914
I have been called,
and vengeance shall I wreak.

19:42.949 --> 19:48.855
Cower, masculine one.
Tremble as you face my wrath.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.824
Xander, I'm starting to think
that maybe we should
do a potluck thing.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.759
Honey.
(Gasps)

19:53.792 --> 19:57.663
Hello. I am here
to tear this man apart.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.767
How many pieces
do you wish?

20:00.799 --> 20:02.835
Halfrek!

20:02.868 --> 20:04.871
Anyanka? Oh, my God!
(Laughing)

20:04.903 --> 20:08.275
Hi!
Hi! How are you?
How are you?

20:08.307 --> 20:11.743
You two--
You know each other?

20:11.778 --> 20:16.348
Funny, Halfrek. I didn't summon
you to kill Xander. I called
to invite you to our wedding.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.920
You-- Oh, my--
What an embarrassing mistake.

20:20.952 --> 20:23.355
Oh, my God! Gorgeous!
(Laughs)

20:23.390 --> 20:27.626
Huh. Wow. Um, you two
clearly have some
catching up to do,

20:27.660 --> 20:29.862
so I'll, uh--

20:29.895 --> 20:32.131
I'll not be
in the apartment.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.704
(Door Opens, Closes)
Gosh, it's swell to see
you again, Hallie.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.773
I didn't mean to
have you materialize
all the way here.

20:41.807 --> 20:45.944
I mean, not until the ceremony.
I guess I got
the message garbled.

20:45.978 --> 20:50.782
You know how it is.
Half the time, I have no idea
if I'm maiming the right guy.

20:50.817 --> 20:56.055
So, um,
you're marrying that man
with the large upper arms?

20:56.087 --> 20:58.424
Yes.
Why?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.928
Well,
because I love him.
Hmm.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.330
Uh, we're gonna be
very happy together.

21:04.364 --> 21:08.434
Hmm.
What?

21:17.710 --> 21:21.113
TIMOTHY:
It's boiling with nothing in it.
Sometimes it does that.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.316
They say bugs
fall in there.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.953
Oh, I'm back.
You can go on
your break now.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.645
(Knocking)

21:53.680 --> 21:56.315
Come in.
It's me.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.317
Dawn said
I could come up.

21:59.352 --> 22:04.289
So, is she pissed at you,
too, or just at me?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.558
What did you
tell her about me?

22:08.827 --> 22:11.096
Do you want something?

22:12.097 --> 22:16.536
Um, yeah, actually.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.337
I mean, I don't know if
you wanted to keep it, or--

22:20.839 --> 22:22.974
You want it? Really?

22:23.009 --> 22:27.078
Well, yeah.
You know, I mean,
it's not much, but it's home.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.849
Or it was.
I don't know.
I guess it's stupid, but--

22:30.883 --> 22:35.454
No, it's not stupid.
You can have it. Of course.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.327
Hey, so I hear you got
this whole cold-turkey thing
going on.

22:42.361 --> 22:46.398
How's that going?
It's good.
It's really good.

22:46.432 --> 22:48.835
I mean,
it was hard at first,

22:48.867 --> 22:53.105
frustrating doing everything
the slow way.

22:53.138 --> 22:57.076
It was like, is everything
gonna take forever forever?

22:57.108 --> 22:59.445
Yeah.

22:59.479 --> 23:04.250
But, uh, it's better now.
I'm getting my focus back.

23:04.282 --> 23:07.753
Hmm. I can see that.

23:10.256 --> 23:13.159
It-It's a pivotal page.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.864
So, this is it, huh?

23:17.896 --> 23:20.298
This is gonna be
your life from now on?

23:20.332 --> 23:24.036
What? No.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.940
Well, you're never
gonna do it again, ever.

23:27.973 --> 23:33.613
You're never gonna...
feel how it made you feel.

23:33.645 --> 23:36.648
Don't think that's
the way to look at it.

23:36.682 --> 23:39.451
Hey, Wil?

23:39.486 --> 23:41.854
It's your birthday.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.256
Um, no, it isn't.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.792
But now that you mention it,
Buffy's is coming.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.761
Potestas.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.300
What?

24:05.545 --> 24:09.080
-Amy.
-It's a gift.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.250
It's magic,
and it didn't come from you.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.887
It came from me.
Completely legal.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.191
Enjoy.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.898
(Horn Honks)

24:58.830 --> 25:01.733
Look!
Look what I found
under the meat grinder.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.636
-Oh, my God.
-Want to tell me
what's going on?

25:04.671 --> 25:07.574
-I'm not sure.
-Try again.

25:07.606 --> 25:12.478
Well, there was an accident,
maybe, six weeks ago,
a grinder incident.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.413
Right. But see,
this isn't six weeks old.
This is new.

25:15.446 --> 25:17.916
It is? Oh. Um, well,

25:17.950 --> 25:20.686
maybe Gary did come in
this morning, or, I don't know,
late last night.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.422
M-Maybe there was an accident,
and he got himself
to the hospital.

25:23.454 --> 25:26.424
Right. Maybe he's
in the hospital.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.596
(Pounds Desk)
Or maybe he's in
the grinder, huh? Huh?

25:29.628 --> 25:32.097
Meat process?
Secret ingredient?

25:32.131 --> 25:36.001
Maybe Gary's on the grill,
or maybe he's under
the pickle chips.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.970
Buffy. Buffy!

25:39.605 --> 25:43.576
-Stop! Stop!
Everybody, you have to stop!
-MAN: Hey!

25:43.609 --> 25:46.412
Stop eating!
No, you can't eat this!

25:46.444 --> 25:48.748
It's not beef!
It's people!

25:48.780 --> 25:50.950
The Doublemeat Medley
is people!

25:50.982 --> 25:53.952
The meat layer,
it's definitely people.
It's people! It's people!

25:53.986 --> 25:57.690
Probably not
the chickeny part,
but who knows? Who knows?

25:57.723 --> 26:01.126
What about the cherry pie?

26:06.498 --> 26:08.701
(Buffy Grunting)

26:08.734 --> 26:11.303
What are you doing?
I thought you were
part of the team!

26:15.141 --> 26:17.108
(Clattering)

26:17.143 --> 26:19.144
You are fired.

26:23.782 --> 26:27.252
Tell me more
about Xander.

26:27.286 --> 26:31.289
You keep asking about him.
I mean, do you think
I'm making a mistake?

26:31.323 --> 26:34.894
Do you?
Well, no.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.462
Xander, he--

26:37.496 --> 26:40.432
he's very kind and brave,

26:40.465 --> 26:45.070
and he has the sweetest smile
and the nicest body,
and he loves me.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.439
Sometimes it isn't easy,
but he does.

26:47.472 --> 26:50.476
Who told you that it
isn't easy to love you?

26:51.877 --> 26:54.747
Well, you know,
I'll do something
or say something,

26:54.780 --> 26:58.284
and then he
has to say stuff like,

26:58.317 --> 27:01.086
"It's incorrect for you
to appreciate money so much,"

27:01.119 --> 27:04.190
or, "Observe.
Here is how a real human
would behave."

27:04.222 --> 27:06.625
Oh, so he corrects you?

27:07.660 --> 27:09.695
Well, no. It's just--

27:09.729 --> 27:12.298
Uh, uh, well, no. I mean,
now I'm all confused.

27:12.330 --> 27:16.935
I mean, what? Do you think
there's something wrong
with the way he treats me?

27:16.969 --> 27:20.038
Do you?
Okay, you have
to stop doing that.

27:20.071 --> 27:23.375
I love Xander.
Even though he thinks he
knows better than you?

27:23.409 --> 27:26.712
But he doesn't.
He doesn't think that.
Okay, I'm sorry.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.980
(Laughs)
I was just curious.

27:29.015 --> 27:32.617
You know, you don't have to
say another thing about it
if you're not comfortable.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.822
But-But I am.
I mean, it's--

27:35.855 --> 27:38.790
it's not like I'm hiding
any deficiencies or anything.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.393
Hmm.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.664
I have absolutely no threes.
Go fish.

27:49.367 --> 27:53.471
I call an emergency meeting,
and this is it?
Where's Willow? Where's Anya?

27:53.505 --> 27:56.742
I couldn't find Willow.
I knocked and knocked
on her door.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.377
And Anya's entertaining
a vengeance demon
named Hallie.

27:59.411 --> 28:03.148
Say, Buff, did you ever
see Anya as a demon?
'Cause if that's it? Whoa.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.353
There's something wrong
at the Doublemeat Palace.
Really wrong.

28:07.385 --> 28:11.190
Have you been demon fighting?
Is that why you smell funny?

28:11.222 --> 28:13.859
No, I'm talking about--
(Sniffing)

28:13.893 --> 28:17.930
Uhh! That's great.
That's-- That's just great.

28:17.963 --> 28:22.167
I try to do the simplest thing
in the world, get an ordinary
job in a well-lit place,

28:22.201 --> 28:24.336
and look-- I'm right back
where I started.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.205
Blood and death
and funky smells. Look.

28:27.239 --> 28:30.308
Look what I found
near the grinder.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.579
Eww.
Wh-Whose is that?

28:34.613 --> 28:37.449
I don't know. It might be
this guy named Gary.

28:37.482 --> 28:41.887
Only one in the whole place
who didn't seem all brain-dead.
He didn't show up this morning.

28:41.921 --> 28:45.857
Except now I think
he was there the whole time
as the secret ingredient.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.927
We need to analyze that burger.
We need to find out
if it used to be people.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.463
What?

28:52.498 --> 28:55.300
-People?
-Xander, you ate the burger?

28:55.334 --> 28:58.369
Well, first you
say it's cat.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.940
Then you come in,
hand me a burger.
Blah, blah, blah.

29:00.972 --> 29:05.111
Five minutes later, "Oh,
and by the way, it happens to
be hot, delicious human flesh"?

29:05.144 --> 29:08.579
I needed that burger to
analyze it. Now I'm gonna
have to get another one.

29:08.614 --> 29:12.084
That's your problem
with this scenario?
You getting seconds?

29:12.117 --> 29:14.820
Late. Late. Sorry.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.825
I-- I was reading for school.
Well, highlighting, anyway.

29:18.857 --> 29:23.261
Anyway, late.
Yeah, you just missed
the Gary burger.

29:23.295 --> 29:27.532
What are we doing?
Let's jump right in. Did Xander
say something about food?

29:30.301 --> 29:33.105
DAWN:
You wouldn't want any.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.773
Apparently,
the Doublemeat Medley is people.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.478
(Belches)
Ooh. Bad.

29:39.510 --> 29:43.281
I bet it's not even
just this one time,
or even this one town.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.986
-There are Doublemeat Palaces
all over California.
-I've eaten there a lot.

29:47.019 --> 29:50.021
Everyone has.
They've got
the perfect deal.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.758
Everyone expects
high turnover
of the employees.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.494
They get the meat for nothing,
and-- and they have us
disposing of the bodies.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.932
How sick is that?
We need to bring down
the whole corporation.

29:59.965 --> 30:04.202
Well, Xander ate the burger.
Is there any way for sure
to figure out what it was?

30:04.236 --> 30:08.673
Oh, yeah.
I can start analyzing it
with science, not--

30:08.707 --> 30:11.442
I can use science.
You ate it?

30:11.477 --> 30:15.814
Um, we have the wrapper.
There's little scribbles
of meat on the wrapper.

30:15.847 --> 30:18.217
Okay, good. You guys
get working on that.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.618
It's after closing,
so I'm gonna go there
and see what I can find out.

30:20.652 --> 30:25.057
Cool. You go.
We'll be good.
(Door Slams, Bell Chimes)

30:25.090 --> 30:27.058
(Exhales Deeply)

30:29.028 --> 30:32.230
Are you okay?
I'm just worried
about Buffy.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.933
WILLOW:
She could be
walking into anything.

31:18.109 --> 31:21.913
(Clattering)
(Gasps)
Manny?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.290
(Thudding)
(Groans)
Manny?

31:35.094 --> 31:38.297
Guess you really were a lifer.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.902
I don't need magic.
Don't need it.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.372
Don't need it.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.875
My friend Janice?
Her sister's a lawyer.

31:49.907 --> 31:53.444
You think I should
sue over the burger?
That's interesting.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.915
No, I just mean...

31:57.950 --> 32:02.721
Buffy's never gonna be
a lawyer or a doctor,
anything big.

32:02.753 --> 32:06.724
She's the Slayer.
She saves the whole world.
That's way bigger.

32:06.758 --> 32:11.730
But that means she's gonna have,
like, crap jobs her whole life,
right? Minimum-wage stuff.

32:11.762 --> 32:14.665
I mean, I could still
grow up to be anything.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.836
But for her, this is it.

32:17.868 --> 32:21.140
Okay, but maybe you'll be
a lawyer or a doctor,

32:21.173 --> 32:23.842
and you can use all your money
to support your deadbeat sister.

32:23.875 --> 32:27.313
Oh, that's terrifically better.
Thanks.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.847
Hey, guys,
I think I've got it.

32:29.881 --> 32:33.684
Good job, Wil.
Those aren't, like,
potions, are they?

32:33.719 --> 32:36.822
No. No potions.
It's not magic.

32:36.855 --> 32:41.259
It's chemistry.
You can tell by
how damn slow it is.

32:41.292 --> 32:45.797
I made a solution that
reacts to the proteins
in human blood,

32:45.830 --> 32:50.169
-so we're pretty close
to knowing for certain.
-(Door Slams)

32:50.201 --> 32:54.039
-I'm here! I'm here.
-We're doing chemistry.

32:54.073 --> 32:57.476
Oh. So sorry I hurried.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.211
Hey, did your friend
have a good time
and then leave?

33:00.246 --> 33:03.148
-She's gone.
-So, An,

33:03.182 --> 33:05.651
the way she
looked with the face,

33:05.683 --> 33:07.818
(Chuckles)
that wasn't what you
used to look like, was it?

33:07.853 --> 33:12.290
Is there something wrong
with that? I mean, did you
think she was unattractive?

33:12.324 --> 33:15.361
Okay, is there any answer
to that question that
won't make you nuts?

33:15.394 --> 33:18.696
Halfrek was always considered
to be a great beauty.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.634
Well, hon, she was a little--
There was some veiny-ness.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.869
Hold this.

33:24.970 --> 33:30.875
Okay, if the solution
reacts to the proteins,
then I'll be able to see it.

33:30.909 --> 33:34.645
I mean, I'll be able to look
through the microscope
and then see it.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.182
It's not like you're
so perfect, either,

33:37.215 --> 33:42.988
what with your strangely large
upper arms and your tendency
to criticize.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.824
-Huh?
-What do you see?

33:45.856 --> 33:50.496
-There's no reaction.
-Oh, God, no.
There's no reaction.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.865
Which means
it's not human.
It's not human!

33:54.900 --> 33:58.036
It's not human?
Well, is it demon meat?

33:58.069 --> 34:00.605
I mean, maybe someone's,
you know,

34:00.638 --> 34:03.875
killing demons and using them
as a cheap source of meat.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.278
I mean, we've all
heard of that.

34:06.311 --> 34:09.715
And, by the way, I'm opposed
to using demon meat, no matter
how much money it saves.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.284
Does that surprise you?
Again, I say, "Huh?"

34:12.318 --> 34:15.121
No, I'm not sure
what I'm seeing.

34:15.152 --> 34:18.056
Cellulose?

34:18.090 --> 34:20.659
There's something weird here.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.175
Scalp?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.811
Wig.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.813
Wig lady?

34:42.847 --> 34:45.751
Oh, dear. Wig lady.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.987
Is that what they call me?

34:49.018 --> 34:52.458
I don't care for that.

34:52.489 --> 34:57.496
I mean, I have to do something
to hide this.

34:57.528 --> 35:00.166
(Creature Screeching)

35:02.601 --> 35:05.070
(Grunting)
It's paralyzing.

35:05.103 --> 35:09.675
Don't try to move, dear.
You really can't, much.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.257
The paralysis
spreads upward,
by the way.

35:26.291 --> 35:30.961
Oh, you may want
to flail your arms a bit
while you still can.

35:30.996 --> 35:35.132
Did I tell you
you're my favorite?

35:35.166 --> 35:38.836
-(Screeching Continues)
-Doublemeat workers.

35:38.869 --> 35:42.773
You're so full
of Doublemeat burgers,

35:42.807 --> 35:46.777
and you just
slide down so smooth.

35:46.811 --> 35:52.217
Oh, I just love the paralysis.
It means I can eat you slowly.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.543
I know you're under there.

36:18.577 --> 36:21.579
WILLOW OVER SPEAKER:
Buffy, are you in there?

36:21.612 --> 36:23.681
I can't see you inside.

36:23.715 --> 36:27.353
Buffy, if you're in there,
the burger isn't people.

36:31.889 --> 36:36.394
They aren't even meat.
It's all processed vegetables.
Isn't that weird?

36:39.431 --> 36:43.068
Buffy, there's more.

36:43.101 --> 36:46.538
Something happened today,
and it wasn't my fault.

36:46.572 --> 36:50.576
It was Amy's fault,
but I feel so bad about it.

36:50.608 --> 36:54.713
It was Amy's power,
but it felt like I was
doing everything myself,

36:54.746 --> 36:57.081
and I couldn't stop.

36:57.114 --> 37:02.588
And now it's gone,
and I feel kind of shaky
and like I need it. Buffy?

37:16.067 --> 37:18.304
Buffy, something fell.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.978
Buffy!

37:27.012 --> 37:30.416
Visitors. How nice.

37:31.317 --> 37:34.420
(Willow Screams)

37:37.956 --> 37:40.190
Missed me.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.130
Oh. Ohh!

37:45.163 --> 37:47.798
-(Buffy Groaning)
-Buffy!

37:56.842 --> 37:58.777
-(Screeches)
-(Screams)

38:01.612 --> 38:06.418
Buffy, are you all right?
Paralyzed, but I think
it's wearing off.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.619
I did it.
I killed her, Buffy.
Look.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.994
(Both)
Ew.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.509
Hey.
Amy.

38:30.541 --> 38:33.110
Can I come in?
My new place isn't set up,

38:33.143 --> 38:36.947
and I wanted to borrow
some stuff like detergent.
You really can't.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.686
I can't borrow detergent?

38:40.719 --> 38:44.222
Well, when they start calling me
Stinky Amy, I'm just gonna say,
"Hey, not my fault."

38:44.255 --> 38:48.393
-I can't spend time
with you anymore.
-What?

38:48.427 --> 38:50.661
You can't come in here again.

38:50.695 --> 38:55.534
-What's up? You didn't like
your birthday present?
-That's right.

38:55.567 --> 38:59.204
You're telling me
that you didn't have
a genuine blast?

38:59.237 --> 39:04.742
Come on! That was a sweet spell.
It was like a trip to Disneyland
without the lines.

39:04.775 --> 39:09.014
You don't get it.
What you did to me was wrong.

39:09.047 --> 39:13.851
Do you have any idea
how much harder that makes,
just, everything?

39:13.885 --> 39:18.222
You know what I notice?
You're not denying
that you had fun.

39:18.255 --> 39:22.027
-Shut up.
-Oh, yeah.
Sharp argument you got there.

39:22.059 --> 39:25.195
Were you on the debate team?
I forget.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.333
I forgot a lot while you
were failing to make me
be not a rat.

39:28.365 --> 39:33.003
Amy, if you really
are my friend,

39:33.038 --> 39:35.206
you better stay
away from me,

39:35.239 --> 39:38.409
and if you really aren't,

39:38.443 --> 39:40.646
you better stay
away from me.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.233
-(Knocking)
-Yeah?

40:02.266 --> 40:04.402
Hi.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.204
You must be
the new manager.
I'm Buffy Summers.

40:07.237 --> 40:11.141
I'm Lorraine Ross.
They called me in when
Manny did his disappearing act.

40:11.175 --> 40:15.079
You hear about that?
Guy just disappeared.
Yeah.

40:15.112 --> 40:18.583
I think-- I think that
used to happen a lot
around here.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.119
Buffy Summers.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.322
I heard about you.
Caused a big scene.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.592
Oh, yeah.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.126
Practical jokes,
not really right
for the workplace.

40:29.159 --> 40:31.730
I so get that now.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.666
Anyway, I just wanted
to return my uniform.
Oh.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.967
Most people
don't even bother.

40:42.007 --> 40:47.112
The Doublemeat Medley...
is vegetables?

40:47.144 --> 40:49.280
How do you know that?

40:49.313 --> 40:51.483
So I guess it's true.

40:51.516 --> 40:54.152
Um, can you close the door?

40:57.355 --> 41:00.190
Have a seat.

41:03.027 --> 41:07.998
It's a formed and texturized,
vegetable-based meat-like
product, suitable for grinding.

41:08.032 --> 41:11.268
It's blended with large amounts
of rendered beef fat
for flavor.

41:11.302 --> 41:16.007
Wait.
The secret ingredient
in the beef is beef?

41:16.041 --> 41:19.545
Buffy, you know
something powerful here.
Do you understand that?

41:19.577 --> 41:24.682
The Doublemeat reputation
is built on a foundation of,
well, meat.

41:24.715 --> 41:27.385
You can't spread this around.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.420
I get that.

41:31.856 --> 41:36.260
-It's a valuable secret,
isn't it?
-Is there something you want?

41:37.929 --> 41:41.065
-I really need money.
-You want money?

41:41.099 --> 41:43.869
No. Well, I mean,
yes, but no.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.871
I-- Well,
I want to work.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.974
See, I have
zero money coming in,
and there are expenses,

41:50.007 --> 41:54.512
and by the time I interview for
a new job and get hired and go
through a training process--

41:54.545 --> 41:58.349
I'd-- I'd really like
to not be fired anymore.

41:58.382 --> 42:01.686
Well, I don't want
any more practical jokes.
I mean it.

42:01.719 --> 42:05.356
I promise.

42:05.389 --> 42:09.760
I'm a little shorthanded
right now, and you're
already trained.

42:11.862 --> 42:15.333
-I think you can not be fired.
-Thank you.

42:15.365 --> 42:19.003
That's great.
I can do the job.
I promise that too.

42:19.036 --> 42:22.440
I certainly hope so.
I don't like short-timers,
Buffy.

42:22.472 --> 42:24.842
I like people
who want to be here.

42:24.876 --> 42:29.047
Maybe you didn't
take this job seriously before,

42:29.079 --> 42:31.449
but from now on--

42:31.481 --> 42:36.121
See this? I want you
to be shooting for this
from here on out.

42:37.554 --> 42:39.523
Right.

42:39.556 --> 42:41.559
Here on out.

42:50.434 --> 42:54.139
(theme music plays)

43:15.360 --> 43:17.295
Grr! Arrgh!
