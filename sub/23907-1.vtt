02:23.109 --> 02:25.544
Seemed all right a minute ago.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.579
"Seemed."

02:29.282 --> 02:31.683
You were somewhere else
all night.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.652
I'm sorry.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.354
We're divorced now,

02:36.389 --> 02:38.657
can't keep expecting this.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.493
You called me.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.562
I know.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.733
Just didn't want
to be alone tonight.

02:50.203 --> 02:53.772
The anniversary
is tomorrow, not tonight.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.175

03:01.414 --> 03:04.849
Can we please just have a drink?
This is depressing as shit, Roy.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.652
Come on,

03:07.687 --> 03:10.355
one drink isn't
gonna hurt you.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.492
Doesn't work that way.
You know that.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.565
<i>Good evening. Continuing
coverage on the breaking news...</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.234
It's my favourite one
of us together.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.903
<i>- State prisoner David Slaney...</i>
- I like to think of her

03:24.938 --> 03:28.139
like that,
not whatever she is now,

03:28.174 --> 03:31.443
wherever she is.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.478
Minus the hideous tattoo
of course.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.814
<i>...distance and to contact
authorities immediately.</i>

03:35.849 --> 03:38.283
<i>Slaney, seen here,</i>

03:38.318 --> 03:40.552
<i>was convicted five years ago
for marijuana.</i>

03:40.587 --> 03:42.554
- I gotta go.
- <i>Officials are currently</i>

03:42.589 --> 03:44.556
<i>at the scene trying
to piece together exactly...</i>

03:44.591 --> 03:46.792
You asked me to come here,
you're just gonna leave?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.329
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Authorities have posted</i>

03:51.364 --> 03:53.331
<i>rewards for anyone
with knowledge</i>

03:53.366 --> 03:55.467
<i>that would lead
to the apprehension of Slaney.</i>

03:55.502 --> 03:57.802
<i>This dirt bag is David Slaney.</i>

03:57.837 --> 04:01.306
He escaped from
Dorchester Penitentiary
and he's on the run.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.075
I have a personal history
with this asshole.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.611
I'm the one that put him
away five years ago.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.347
So I'm damn sure not gonna
let him walk away this time.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.217
Slaney's just a drug smuggler.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.419
A stoner managed
to bust out of prison,

04:14.454 --> 04:16.354
we'll find him.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.690
We posted a reward.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.092
Some cash to help
win over the locals.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.894
Reward's a bad idea.
50 bucks,

04:22.929 --> 04:25.697
people around here will tell you
they saw Elvis in an outhouse.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.766
Known accomplices:

04:27.801 --> 04:29.634
Brian Hearn.
Hearn got away

04:29.669 --> 04:33.138
the first time that Slaney
went down. Gather in.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.175
Not you.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.848
Do we have
a problem?

04:43.883 --> 04:45.850
Why do you say that?

04:45.885 --> 04:49.287
We both know why your career
is in the place that it is,

04:49.322 --> 04:52.757
and mine isn't.
- What's going on here, partner?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.893
I am not your partner anymore.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.861
You're gonna be canvassing
with the uniforms

04:56.896 --> 04:59.064
far away from where
you can do any more damage.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.932
Are we clear?

05:00.967 --> 05:03.969
Maybe I should just go home.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.408
<i>I wasn't supposed to pick you
for a few miles yet.</i>

05:10.443 --> 05:12.877
I just escaped from prison.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.547
Chased by dogs, everything else,
running through the woods

05:15.582 --> 05:18.116
at night, I...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.118
I got turned around a bit.
- This place is crawling

05:20.153 --> 05:22.053
with cops.
- Really?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.989
I hadn't noticed.
- Suitcase, it's yours.

05:25.024 --> 05:27.525
Cash, threads,
everything you asked for.

05:45.078 --> 05:48.313
You got a name?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.315
Taking enough risks
as it is,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.851
you don't need
to know my name.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.586
Fair enough.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.522
I'm sympathetic
to your situation.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.724
I mean, no way you should
have gotten 15 years.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.960
Unfortunately,

06:01.995 --> 06:04.196
the judge didn't see it
that way.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.401
Stay back.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.338
You better lay low

06:13.373 --> 06:16.074
until we get some distance
between us and those cops.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.310
You can change later.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.516
<i>She's got a deep hold.</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:26.551
<i>I mean, it's plenty of room
under the floor,</i>

06:26.586 --> 06:28.586
<i>perfect for hiding
whatever you want.</i>

06:28.621 --> 06:30.922
It's gonna reek like weed
if anyone comes aboard.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.391
Just don't shower,
cover it up.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.393
Now look, I know

06:35.428 --> 06:37.395
we don't look the part,
but, uh...

06:37.430 --> 06:39.598
he's half a bayman,
so he can sail her.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.168
What?
- Knock it off.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.138
Come on, man, this is it.
You and me all the way!

06:48.308 --> 06:52.844
I like things to be simple;
this is far from simple.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.146
We sail south, OK?

06:55.181 --> 06:58.216
We buy dope.
We have a few daiquiris.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.485
We come home.
We make a fortune.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.221
What's not simple
about that, man?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.190
Huh?

07:05.225 --> 07:08.159
I have responsibilities,
people who are counting on me.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.361
I dig that, but how
are you gonna provide for them,

07:10.396 --> 07:12.897
Jennifer and her kid,
with minimum wage?

07:12.932 --> 07:16.301
Is that your plan, huh?
This is how you provide for 'em!

07:16.336 --> 07:18.903
This will change
your life, man!

07:18.938 --> 07:21.039
You gotta ask
yourself, Slaney:

07:21.074 --> 07:24.943
are you a sheep
or are you a wolf? Hmm?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.480
Wolves eat sheep, Hearn,
and sheep taste like shit.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.748
OK. Wolves eat sheep
or they don't eat sheep.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.685
Wolves do whatever they want
because they're wolves.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.188
Come on!

07:37.857 --> 07:40.358
This is dangerous, it's risky.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.460
Look,

07:42.495 --> 07:45.063
you're a brother.
No, screw that,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.365
you're more
than a brother to me.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.801
You don't want to do this,
you say the word,

07:49.836 --> 07:52.237
it's over.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.806
No hard feelings. I swear.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.942
Seriously.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.677
But I promise you

07:59.712 --> 08:02.647
that this opportunity
doesn't happen again.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.321
You're an asshole.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.691
Yeah?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.095
- Sir!
- What are you gonna do?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.596
We're buying her.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.632
- We're buying her?
- We're buying her.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.600
- We're buying her?!
- We're buying her.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.271
WE'RE BUYING HER! Ha ha ha ha!
Yes! Yes, we're buying her!

08:26.306 --> 08:28.607
Come here! Ha ha ha ha!

08:29.976 --> 08:32.310

08:36.849 --> 08:39.517
You're a heavy sleeper.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.620
Wish I could pull out like that.
- No, you don't.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.356
Haven't seen a cop for miles,
I think we're in the clear.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.261
They sure know
how to put on a show.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.730
They say the trick
is to make it

08:52.765 --> 08:54.499
through the first 24 hours.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.969
I'd say the trick is not to
get caught in the first place.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.371
That's it?
- She's your contact.

09:00.406 --> 09:03.107
Stay put until you hear
from us again.

of one of the largest crackdowns

12:33.152 --> 12:34.519

12:34.554 --> 12:36.521
what we believe

of the organization,
John Barlow.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.692
Agent Williams, would you mind?
- Sure.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.494
I was on the ground

12:43.529 --> 12:46.397
for every one of these sixteen
successful takedowns.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.167

12:49.202 --> 12:51.602
was a part
of John Barlow's network.

12:51.637 --> 12:55.039

contains ongoing operations,

12:55.074 --> 12:58.075
my recommendations--
- Williams,

12:58.110 --> 13:00.812
as I was going to say,
would you mind

13:00.847 --> 13:02.480
getting us some coffee?

13:02.515 --> 13:05.483
And some cigarettes too?

13:11.991 --> 13:15.193

13:15.228 --> 13:17.995
All right. Open up your dossier
to the first page.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.997
Let's take a look
at the foreign seaboard.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.400
The east side...

13:30.843 --> 13:33.444
Bad day?

13:33.479 --> 13:37.181
You could say that.

13:37.216 --> 13:40.651
Your receptionist
isn't very receptive.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.354
Can I help you?

13:43.389 --> 13:46.257
I'm looking
for a KC Williams.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.326
- I'm Williams.
- Perfect.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.127
Makes this
all much simpler.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.564
What, are you surprised?
Did you think I was that
one subordinate?

13:53.599 --> 13:56.200
I think I need
to buy you a drink.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.402
You're here
to buy me a drink?!

13:58.437 --> 13:59.804
No.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.039
I just think you'd be very happy
to hear what I have to say,

14:02.074 --> 14:04.409
Agent Williams.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.312
Maybe for now,
you just keep

14:08.347 --> 14:10.314
this conversation between us.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.618
Well, "Detective Patterson..."

14:16.622 --> 14:18.823
...everyone's gone
around 5.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.025
Come back then.

14:48.754 --> 14:52.023
man:

14:53.693 --> 14:56.594
Ask Brian Hearn
what my name is.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.230
<i>You tell him</i>

14:59.265 --> 15:01.399
<i>that I am out...</i>

15:02.735 --> 15:06.103
...and I'd like to speak
with him if that's OK.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.339
So you tell him that.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.060
That was quick.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.962
Slaney?

15:34.800 --> 15:37.301
What's with the other guy?

15:37.336 --> 15:40.705
- Called a chain.
- Look at him. His own chain

15:40.740 --> 15:42.573
and everything now, huh?

15:42.608 --> 15:46.410
So, big man has
busted out, huh? Ha ha ha!

15:46.445 --> 15:50.047
And you're all over the news.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.949
Slaney the sheep

15:53.986 --> 15:55.653
Mm-hmm.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.357
Man, we, uh...
we haven't talked in--

15:59.392 --> 16:02.026
Five years, four months
and seventeen days,

16:02.061 --> 16:04.328
but who's keeping track?

16:04.363 --> 16:07.064
Yeah, been a long time
for sure.

16:07.099 --> 16:10.701
I was incarcerated,
you took a runner.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.904
Kind of hard to get together
for a chat and a cup of tea.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.707
Look, I get it.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.709
I get it, you're pissed off.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.646
You were my best friend.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.616
You left me.
- No.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.420
OK? I just didn't get caught.
OK? You did.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.455
Oh, that's how
you see it, huh?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.458
[Yeah, and what good would
it have done for us both
to be on the inside, huh?]

16:34.493 --> 16:36.494
And it didn't
occur to you

16:36.529 --> 16:38.996
to pay Tom-Tom
and his brothers back

16:39.031 --> 16:40.998
after all this time?

16:41.033 --> 16:43.301
- That's complicated.
- Mm-hmm.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.406
He had his guys beat me

16:48.441 --> 16:50.641
within an inch of my life
every time he had a notion

16:50.676 --> 16:53.344
that I might know
where you are out there.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.713
I'm sorry, man,
I didn't know that.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.391
...my life here, it's, uh...

17:07.426 --> 17:10.127
...it's gone sideways, man.
The DEA's

17:14.233 --> 17:16.367
I've been building birdhouses
and license plates.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.569
You see the slight imbalance?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.404
Aaaah... Slaney.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.442
Ahhh...

17:24.477 --> 17:26.510
God, it's good
to hear your voice!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.579
Prove it.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.217
AHOY!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.621
Isn't she great?

17:37.656 --> 17:40.024
Huh?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.026
The boat or the girl?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.195
The boat.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.964
She ran to ground,
took on some water, but they did

17:46.999 --> 17:49.300
a nice exterior repair,

17:49.335 --> 17:51.302
inside is fine,
she floats nice,

17:51.337 --> 17:54.038
got her for a good number.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.107
The girl,

17:56.142 --> 17:58.642
she crewed with the last owner.

17:58.677 --> 18:01.112
Finders keepers.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.815
Carter, you think that she,

18:04.850 --> 18:07.785
a girl who looks like that,

18:07.820 --> 18:09.820
is interested in you?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.622
I'm catnip for the ladies.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.657
She took one look at me,
wouldn't let me leave

18:13.692 --> 18:15.626
without taking her.
- Our entire network

18:15.661 --> 18:18.662
across the U.S. is being
shut down by the DEA

18:18.697 --> 18:21.232
and you bring someone here
I don't know?

18:21.267 --> 18:24.034
- She's not a cop!
- How would you know?

18:24.069 --> 18:25.870
What's wrong, man?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.206
Slaney's out.
Busted out.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.543
Slaney, Slaney?
David Slaney? When?

18:32.578 --> 18:34.712
I just got off the phone
with him.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.514
He called you?

18:36.549 --> 18:39.049
He had the gall
to call you here?!

18:39.084 --> 18:41.452
Why? What are we supposed
to do with him?

18:41.487 --> 18:43.554
I'm still thinking that over.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.590
- Hey, everything OK here, babe?
- Yeah!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.993
Is this your friend
you were telling me about?

18:49.028 --> 18:51.762
You got a name?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.597
Yeah, I'm Ada.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.399
I don't know you.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.436
Yeah, of course not,
we just met.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.476
What is his problem?

19:05.511 --> 19:09.180
Ah, it's OK,
he's gonna be fine.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.984
No, I'm good, thanks.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.924
Something funny?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.892
- No, just, uh--
- Didn't expect me

19:21.927 --> 19:25.362
to be so... "woman-ey"?

19:25.397 --> 19:27.798
Or black?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.801
I knew exactly who you were
before I drove down here

19:30.836 --> 19:33.837
to see you. I'm just tickled
that actually happened.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.839
All right, Roy Patterson,

19:35.874 --> 19:39.643
you wanna start by explaining
to me why you made the trip?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.416
Drug distributors,
New-York, Boston;

19:45.451 --> 19:47.418
you took down an entire network

19:47.453 --> 19:49.420
of these shitheads
in six months.

19:49.455 --> 19:53.224
- DEA has, yeah.
- I've seen the reports.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.693
Every bust, every takedown,
there's your name.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.895
I've been doing this
for a long...

19:57.930 --> 20:00.097
...for a long...

20:00.132 --> 20:02.666
for a long time.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.236
When a cop's name appears
in every report, the writer

20:05.271 --> 20:07.471
in charge, they're the ones
who did the actual work.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.075
You got a point coming
anytime soon?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.510
I dug around.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.846
Your boss, Avery,
he's a good agent,

20:15.881 --> 20:18.616
but he likes the limelight
even when it's his own people

20:18.651 --> 20:20.484
who deserve it.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.225
Who am I looking at?

20:28.260 --> 20:30.327
This is from five years ago.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.329
You know him as the drug kingpin

20:32.364 --> 20:35.633
of the network you were
rolling up: John Barlow.

20:37.436 --> 20:41.038
Bullshit! Barlow's a ghost.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.141
His real name
is Brian Hearn.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.312
And I busted him
and his best friend,

20:48.347 --> 20:51.048
David Slaney,
five years ago.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.217
Slaney, he went down,

20:53.252 --> 20:57.087
but Hearn, he disappeared.
And then... boom,

20:57.122 --> 20:59.089
he was reborn

20:59.124 --> 21:01.025
as Barlow.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.360
Less than 12 hours ago,

21:03.395 --> 21:05.362
Slaney escaped
from Dorchester Penitentiary.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.364
He's headed straight
for your guy.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.734
What makes you
so sure of that?

21:11.337 --> 21:14.538
Source on the inside.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.041
Slaney won't know
we're on his tail.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.644
So he could lead us

21:20.679 --> 21:22.713
straight to Hearn.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.757
What?

21:36.495 --> 21:39.630
- OK what?
- OK, I got a new deal cooking

21:39.665 --> 21:41.632
and I want you in on it.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.269
But you gotta do
something for me first.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.773
I gotta pass
some kind of test for you now?

21:49.808 --> 21:52.810
No, no, no, no,
it's nothing like that.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.546
No, you're the only one I trust.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.086
OK, get to Montreal
to meet our guy.

22:02.121 --> 22:05.189
He's got some cash I need you to
pick up for me, OK? It's easy.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.224
Yeah, this all sounds
a little déjà vu

22:07.259 --> 22:09.226
for me, I gotta say.
Me going to Montreal,

22:09.261 --> 22:11.228
getting money from people?
I don't know.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.665
This is totally different,
alright? This got nothing
to do with Tommy.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.439
you and me...

22:22.474 --> 22:24.709
we're gonna have
to put the past behind us...

22:26.745 --> 22:28.746
...start over.

22:31.984 --> 22:35.052
Man, just get down here.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.654
I promise you
it'll be worth it.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.491
Fresh start.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.263
I'll go to Montreal.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.066
Get to the place
we used to stay at.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.935
I'll call you
when I'm there.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.742
<i>Look, I appreciate
keeping this just between us</i>

22:58.777 --> 23:01.044
'cause my operation
is not fully, uh...

23:01.079 --> 23:02.880
authorized yet.
- Oh, man,

23:02.915 --> 23:06.216
this pitch just keeps
getting better and better.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.218
You're a good cop;

23:08.253 --> 23:10.154
aren't you sick of getting
those assholes coffee

23:10.189 --> 23:12.122
and having your boss
take credit for your work?

23:12.157 --> 23:14.091
OK, you don't know
anything about me.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.560
Maybe not, but you bring down

23:16.595 --> 23:18.862
one of the men most wanted
by the DEA and you do that

23:18.897 --> 23:22.199
all on your own? No one can take
that away from you.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.369
Not even her.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.039
Well, you know,
we got your type here too.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.041
Not a lot of time left.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.043
More time than you know
what to do with.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.846
So you're trying
to go out with a bang,

23:35.881 --> 23:37.948
but any idiot can see

23:37.983 --> 23:41.018
that it'll be more of a crash.
And when you crash,

23:41.053 --> 23:44.321
you'll end up taking down
any fool who was within
50 yards of you.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.723
And that ain't gonna be me.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.992
Do yourself a favour, Roy,

23:49.027 --> 23:51.228
quit while you're ahead.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.612
Hey.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.814
Hey, Murrin, tell me
you're still on him.

24:10.849 --> 24:14.418
- I'm on him. He's staying put.
- Is there anyone looking for you? O'Neill?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.253
Nah, they stopped
looking for me years ago.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.189
Pretty sure O'Neill thinks I'm
working in the mailroom
these days.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.862
Good man. I'm coming to you.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.373
<i>I don't know,
I'm not so sure of this shirt.</i>

24:36.408 --> 24:38.375
<i>You look good.</i>

24:38.410 --> 24:40.611
You do.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.719
Crystal's finally asleep.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.925
It's nice that we took
the drive out here today.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.528
It's good to get out here.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.130
I, uh...

25:00.165 --> 25:02.299
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.601
Oh?

25:04.636 --> 25:08.071
Like why you and Hearn
are buying a boat?

25:08.106 --> 25:10.073
I heard you on the phone.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.875
Can we not talk
about Hearn right now?

25:11.910 --> 25:14.244
This is kind of important.
- No. I would like to talk

25:14.279 --> 25:16.280
about your little sailing trip.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.549
How long are you going?

25:18.584 --> 25:20.350
It's nothing.

25:20.385 --> 25:23.587
I don't like it
when you lie to me.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.459
Look, we're just taking
a little trip down south
to meet some people.

25:29.494 --> 25:32.663
It's not a big deal.
- People...

25:32.698 --> 25:35.566
I knew it.
He's got you tangled up

25:35.601 --> 25:38.869
in something big this time.
- I am trying

25:38.904 --> 25:41.105
to talk to you
about our future.

25:42.674 --> 25:46.209
Me and you and Crystal's.
- What line of bullshit
are you selling?

25:46.244 --> 25:48.178
It's not bull...
Jen, I'm putting myself

25:48.213 --> 25:50.414
out on a limb here,
I need you to pay attention

25:50.449 --> 25:52.416
for just a second.
- I know what you two been at:

25:52.451 --> 25:54.751
you're selling shit
and it's getting bigger.

25:54.786 --> 25:56.954
Weed. Are you trying to tell
me that you don't smoke weed?

25:56.989 --> 25:59.189
Oh, that's not
the point, David.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.129
I love you
more than anything.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.569
And Crystal, as far as I'm
concerned, is my own daughter.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.672
I wanna be with you.

26:16.842 --> 26:19.310
Both of you
for the rest of my life.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.879
Hearn thinks
he's a gangster now.

26:22.914 --> 26:27.117
No, he's gonna get you caught.
- Would you please... Just...

26:29.388 --> 26:31.688
Would you let me do this?
You know what I'm trying

26:31.723 --> 26:33.724
to do here.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.135
God.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.438
You're such an asshole.

26:49.908 --> 26:53.143
- Because I wanna marry you?
- You need to make

26:53.178 --> 26:55.746
a decision right now.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.181
It's him or me.
Because if you go with him,

26:58.216 --> 27:00.417
we're... we are done.

27:44.196 --> 27:48.131
Ohhh! Look
what a razor does to you!

27:48.166 --> 27:51.435
Closing time.
Oh, don't worry,

27:51.470 --> 27:53.804
she's not a cop.
- Hi.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.141
Hi.

28:22.801 --> 28:25.602
Someone's working late.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.439
This from the Florida rollup?

28:29.474 --> 28:31.408
Don't tell me
you got something new.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.745
I don't know yet. It's
a crumb. Maybe, I don't know.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.248
And this one,
the escaped con from up North,

28:38.283 --> 28:40.217
what's his story?
How's he connected?

28:40.252 --> 28:43.887
He's not.
That's something else.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.689
I know you, K.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.359
Your gut smells something up,
I end up with a promotion.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.229
You're like a pig
sniffing out a truffle.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.464
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just call me a pig.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.601
Oh, you know what I mean.
Come on now.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.703
Don't hold back on me.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.172
I'm just following a lead.
It could be nothing.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.174
Or it could be
something, but...

29:04.209 --> 29:06.676
Well, that "something" part
is all I care about.

29:06.711 --> 29:09.947
I'll let you know.

29:11.616 --> 29:15.485
We've been after that clown
Barlow for years now...

29:15.520 --> 29:19.022
you make ground here,
it'll be good for both of us.

29:19.057 --> 29:21.492
I'll let you know.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.348
What's to explain, Cyril?

31:58.383 --> 32:00.483
Well, I mean, we owe
all of our suppliers,

32:00.518 --> 32:02.419
and no one's gonna
give us any credit

32:02.454 --> 32:04.854

like it's ever gonna be
finished. So if you don't mind

32:09.327 --> 32:11.795
my asking, what's the plan?

32:11.830 --> 32:15.231
Why don't you concentrate
on the things you do understand

32:15.266 --> 32:17.667
and less on the things
that you don't.

32:17.702 --> 32:20.136
<i>Senores.</i>

32:23.174 --> 32:25.375
Just make sure that the bodies

32:25.410 --> 32:28.178

when this is over, OK?

32:35.220 --> 32:37.687
Open top, chief.

32:37.722 --> 32:42.259
I love the feeling of the wind
rushing by, I mean...

32:43.995 --> 32:45.762
And that's why I wear this:

32:45.797 --> 32:47.897
to protect my face
from the bugs, you know?

32:47.932 --> 32:49.833
Even at night,
when people think

32:49.868 --> 32:51.801
I'm <i>loco</i> for wearing these.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.938
Driving around
the pitch black

32:54.973 --> 32:56.807
wearing my sunglasses...

32:58.543 --> 33:00.977
The bugs, man,
they can be

33:01.012 --> 33:04.948
a real source of irritation.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.983
And like, say you get
one in your eye,

33:07.018 --> 33:08.918
obviously, you can't
see straight,

33:08.953 --> 33:10.720
you can't think straight.

33:10.755 --> 33:14.624
All you can do is think
about that little thing...

33:14.659 --> 33:17.160
swimming around in there.

33:21.232 --> 33:24.401
That's where I think
about you two.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.206
Two shit flies.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.812
What am I to do?

33:35.847 --> 33:37.614
Huh?

33:44.522 --> 33:47.957
- I ain't done nothing.
- You are the only one who had

33:47.992 --> 33:49.926
contact with the people

33:49.961 --> 33:52.295
moving our products in the U.S.

33:52.330 --> 33:56.032
Most of them went down,

33:56.067 --> 33:58.535
so how do you explain that, hmm?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.303
Hmm?

34:00.338 --> 34:03.039
You were our guys,

34:03.074 --> 34:05.175
our generals.

34:05.210 --> 34:09.112
We know one of you
was talking to the DEA. Hmm?

34:15.920 --> 34:18.588
So...

34:22.927 --> 34:26.096
...which one is it? Huh?

34:26.131 --> 34:29.666
Which one?

34:29.701 --> 34:32.936
- It was somebody else.
- No! No, no.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.605
Ah! Aaah!

34:40.945 --> 34:43.513
One shit fly down,

34:43.548 --> 34:45.849
one to go.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.383
Aaah.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.521
Do you know how much trust
we're putting in you, Hugo?

34:55.226 --> 35:00.196
I knew it was Alvarez
who was talking to the DEA.

35:00.231 --> 35:03.967
My whole network in the U.S.
is shut down 'cause of that.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.202
OK now, but before you talk,

35:06.237 --> 35:09.672
I want you to listen
very, very carefully, OK?

35:09.707 --> 35:12.175
Do you <i>comprende,</i> Hugo?

35:13.912 --> 35:15.345
Hugo?

35:17.148 --> 35:19.382
Your sister, yeah?

35:19.417 --> 35:22.619
You have a sister?
She still lives in Miami?

35:24.322 --> 35:26.756
She still lives in Northwest

35:26.791 --> 35:30.193
37th, does she?
- The reason we mention this

35:30.228 --> 35:33.296
is we just wanna make sure

35:33.331 --> 35:37.000
that we understand
each other. OK?

35:37.035 --> 35:41.104
Your connections
in Colombia,

35:41.139 --> 35:43.072
I'm gonna need to have
a conversation with them.

35:43.107 --> 35:45.074
See, they have product
that I need

35:45.109 --> 35:48.111
and I need you
to start a dialogue.

35:50.215 --> 35:53.049
- They don't like you.
- That's not my problem,

35:53.084 --> 35:55.285
that's your problem.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.023
You make the intro.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.725
And be sure
to tell them

36:02.760 --> 36:05.728
how nice we are to you.

36:05.763 --> 36:06.963
OK?

36:06.998 --> 36:09.266
Good.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.770
Good. I feel good.
This is great!

36:13.805 --> 36:16.306
Right, Hugo?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.941
Yeah.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.609
<i>You know,</i>

36:19.644 --> 36:22.712
<i>once you've finished up
with Alvarez here,</i>

36:22.747 --> 36:24.914
why don't you come on
by the house for a drink, OK?

36:24.949 --> 36:27.917
<i>Just make sure he goes deep
so the mud sucks him in.</i>

36:27.952 --> 36:31.121
<i>OK? See you at the house.</i>

36:37.929 --> 36:42.165
There is one thing
I'm positive about...

36:42.200 --> 36:45.668
you're cute.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.770
Balls!

36:47.805 --> 36:49.839
He's more than cute.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.242
Well, aren't you a charmer.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.547
Yeah. But he's in love
with this one.

36:57.582 --> 37:00.183
I found it
on the table.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.587
You cut the other guy
out of it.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.556
The kid yours?

37:06.591 --> 37:08.592
No, but...

37:10.628 --> 37:12.595
...she is mine here.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.931
Hmm...

37:14.966 --> 37:17.234
Well, the mom..

37:18.970 --> 37:21.004
...she's beautiful.

37:21.039 --> 37:23.640
Not as beautiful
as you.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.144
Someone once told me

37:28.179 --> 37:31.514
that love is a liability.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.331
Come on.

37:48.366 --> 37:52.101
Uh, I'm good,
but thank you.

37:52.136 --> 37:55.472
No? You're gonna say no
to everything?

38:02.814 --> 38:05.214
- Hey, do you hear that?
- Oh!

38:05.249 --> 38:08.084
Celeste was
crying earlier.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.987
Yeah. Some jerk

38:11.022 --> 38:14.557
in the front row. Fix it.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.293
Hmm...

38:18.796 --> 38:21.731
There you go.
You're, you're...

38:21.766 --> 38:23.500
good as new.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.007
Hmm... Hey.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.110
Fix the other one.

38:36.547 --> 38:39.049
Pull around the side!

38:40.918 --> 38:43.720
- Shit.
- Everybody, get out of here, let's go!

38:43.755 --> 38:46.556
I'm so sorry.

38:46.591 --> 38:47.924
Ow!

38:47.959 --> 38:51.160
Stop! Stop! Stop!

38:51.195 --> 38:53.730
Don't hurt him!
That wasn't the plan! Just...

38:53.765 --> 38:56.132
We called the cops
for the reward, I'm sorry!

38:56.167 --> 38:59.001
- Wait! Just wait!
- No!

38:59.036 --> 39:01.838
No, Annette! I didn't know!

39:01.873 --> 39:05.108
- Stop or we'll shoot!
- Wait for the cops to come.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.046
Slaney, this way!

39:10.081 --> 39:12.115
- Ugh!
- Alright. Come on, let's go!

39:12.150 --> 39:14.016
We gotta go!

39:29.167 --> 39:30.734
Get in!

39:44.582 --> 39:48.518
You all right?
- What the hell!

39:48.553 --> 39:51.454
- ♪ Everywhere is freaks and hairies ♪
- What happened?

39:51.489 --> 39:53.723
I-I got jumped
by some strippers.

39:55.493 --> 39:56.760
Damnit!

39:58.362 --> 40:01.698
I told you not to talk to
anyone. "Lay low, keep
your head down."

40:04.035 --> 40:05.868
They said
there was a reward.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.438
Why was there a reward?
- It's fine, I'm handling it.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.175
They shot at me.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.710
- The strippers?
- Cops! The cops shot at me!

40:14.745 --> 40:16.712
You were gonna clear the way.
If anything happened,

40:16.747 --> 40:20.583
you were gonna step in.
What's going on?

40:20.618 --> 40:22.418
Nothing's changed,
we stick to the plan.

40:22.453 --> 40:25.421
Did you make contact with Hearn?
- I broke out of jail!

40:25.456 --> 40:28.024
"It had to look real,"
that's what you said.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.725
Yeah, it does. It did.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.695
Now, Hearn doesn't
suspect anything.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.231
If this was all for show,

40:35.266 --> 40:38.568
some operation,
why did the cops shoot at me?

40:44.141 --> 40:46.609
There is no operation, is there?

40:48.412 --> 40:50.713
There's no other way.

40:50.748 --> 40:54.016
So no one else knows
what we're doing?

40:54.051 --> 40:56.486
Just you?

40:56.521 --> 41:00.457
Some crazed, wacked-out cop?
You're on your own?!

41:02.827 --> 41:04.460
You used me.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.362
Come on, we both used
each other.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.798
You don't think I saw that?
I was an opportunity.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.067
I don't unlock that window,
there's no way

41:11.102 --> 41:13.436
you're getting out
of that prison.

41:19.377 --> 41:21.477
We stick with the plan.
We get to Hearn.

41:21.512 --> 41:24.447
We bust him. That's it.
- Oh, sure, that's it.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.551
Especially now that THERE'S
AN ACTUAL MANHUNT FOR ME!

41:28.586 --> 41:30.620
You made a choice.
Because of him,

41:30.655 --> 41:32.655
because of Hearn,
you want revenge. I'm giving you

that chance.
It's what you want, right?

41:39.530 --> 41:42.498
You back out on me now...

41:42.533 --> 41:44.500
...you're going
straight back inside.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.904
You're a fucking lunatic.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.373
Yeah, maybe I am.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.642
But we're in it now, we've got
to see this thing through,

41:52.677 --> 41:55.378
you and me,
and I'm all you got.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.813
- I'm gone.
- Oh, come on.

Damnit!

42:04.522 --> 42:06.689
Get your hands off me!
Don't be stupid!
