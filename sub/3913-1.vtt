Well, it's what we do
around here.

I also...

01:16:02.765 --> 01:16:06.235
accept your proposal
to share the gulanite.

01:16:06.269 --> 01:16:10.672
Come to the mines tomorrow,
and we'll discuss the details.

01:16:10.707 --> 01:16:16.311

01:16:46.342 --> 01:16:48.310
My son is dead.

01:16:48.344 --> 01:16:52.080
You and your father
and the mayor all fought

01:16:52.115 --> 01:16:56.285
to save the life of the devil
that killed him.

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:58.754
There will be no justice
until she is dead too.

01:17:00.056 --> 01:17:02.357
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:17:05.895 --> 01:17:09.298
But Monguno
was provoking her.

01:17:09.332 --> 01:17:12.134
She was scared
and lashed out.

You killing her

01:17:14.137 --> 01:17:17.005

make things worse.

- Was he? You know that?
- Yeah!

What if he wasn't?

01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:16.999
He would've put a bullet
right between your eyes.

Nobody forced this man
