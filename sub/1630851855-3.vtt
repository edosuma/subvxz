WEBVTT

00:09.206 --> 00:11.137
- Previously on
"Danger Force."

00:11.206 --> 00:13.379
- We thought we had
exercise-biked Rick Twitler

00:13.448 --> 00:14.896
out of ShoutOut's head,

00:14.965 --> 00:16.758
but then Captain Man's
Helper Monkey

00:16.827 --> 00:18.103
let Drex out of prison,

00:18.172 --> 00:20.000
and put Twitler's mind
into a Cyborg

00:20.068 --> 00:21.931
who trash-rocketed us
into space.

00:24.344 --> 00:26.103
- Oh, my God, that's so cool.

00:26.172 --> 00:27.586
I've never dated
a guy in space.

00:27.655 --> 00:29.827
- Me neither.
- Hey, if you're in space,

00:29.896 --> 00:31.137
why aren't you floating?

00:31.206 --> 00:33.586
- Oh, our suits have
built-in anti-gravity.

00:33.655 --> 00:35.586
- Whoa, how does that work?

00:35.655 --> 00:38.241
- Jody, you are asking
the wrong guy.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.862
I don't even know
how my toilet works.

00:39.931 --> 00:41.793
- Comin' through.
- Locked.

00:42.586 --> 00:44.172
- Space!
- Locked.

00:44.241 --> 00:46.172
- Actual space!
- Will you get down here?

00:46.241 --> 00:47.241
- Nope.

00:47.310 --> 00:50.862
- Untie me. I'll get her down.

00:50.931 --> 00:52.275
- [zapping]
- Ow!

00:52.344 --> 00:54.689
- You don't want
this smoke, son.

00:54.758 --> 00:56.965
- You guys,
we're in actual space!

00:57.034 --> 00:59.379
- Hey, turn the camera.
I want to see the Man's Nest.

00:59.448 --> 01:01.413
- Okay.
- Is this really the best time

01:01.482 --> 01:04.034
for another one
of your charity auction dates?

01:04.103 --> 01:06.862
- You're just jealous because
you only got two charity dates,

01:06.931 --> 01:08.724
and he got 1,000.

01:08.793 --> 01:12.482
But for real, my friend,
this is a bad time.

01:12.551 --> 01:13.689
- It was really nice
to date you.

01:13.758 --> 01:16.586
- I love y--
- Will you get her down?

01:16.655 --> 01:17.724
- Boo!

01:17.793 --> 01:20.586
- Activating her anti-gravity.

01:20.655 --> 01:21.689
- [grunts]

01:21.758 --> 01:23.275
- Now.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.206
- Hey, we gotta get back
and save Swellview

01:25.275 --> 01:26.620
from Cyborg Rick Twitler.

01:26.689 --> 01:28.172
- And I've gotta punch him
so hard in his stupid

01:28.241 --> 01:31.137
ugly Cyborg face that
his whole system shuts down.

01:31.206 --> 01:32.448
- I'm going to shock him
so hard,

01:32.517 --> 01:34.206
he reboots just so you
can knock him out again.

01:34.275 --> 01:36.482
- And I have a date!

01:36.551 --> 01:38.344
- Hey, didn't you and Henry
go to space once?

01:38.413 --> 01:40.241
- Yes, let's call Henry,
he'll know what to do.

01:40.310 --> 01:42.586
- Pfft.
We don't need to call Henry.

01:42.655 --> 01:44.413
- He still not picking up
your calls?

01:44.482 --> 01:46.689
- Shut up, Drex!
We talk all the time!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.413
- Yeah, anyways,

01:49.482 --> 01:52.103
you dummies aren't gonna
stop Cyborg Rick Twitler.

01:52.172 --> 01:53.862
- Oh, yeah? How do you know?

01:53.931 --> 01:55.551
- Because he's
on the news right now

01:55.620 --> 01:57.862
and just said you're
not gonna stop him.

01:57.931 --> 02:00.448
- And now that I've launched
the Man's Nest into space,

02:00.517 --> 02:02.620
I can put my plans
into action.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.862
- Oh, my God, I love it.

02:05.931 --> 02:07.586
- Okay, who gave Drex
the TV remote?

02:07.655 --> 02:09.310
- Hey!
- We're all ears.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.310
Folks at home would
love to hear

02:10.379 --> 02:11.758
exactly what your plans are.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.137
- Well first I'm gonna
tie up the both of you.

02:13.206 --> 02:15.034
- That's what I'd do too.
[all laugh]

02:15.103 --> 02:17.551
- Can someone get us
some rope?

02:17.620 --> 02:19.068
Oh, the extra itchy kind.

02:19.137 --> 02:20.724
- Please continue.

02:20.793 --> 02:23.068
- And then, I'm gonna use
the dish on the roof of KLVY

02:23.137 --> 02:25.448
to access a satellite
that's currently

02:25.517 --> 02:27.862
in geosynchronous orbit
above Swellview.

02:27.931 --> 02:30.103
That satellite
contains remnants

02:30.172 --> 02:32.896
of the Living Sentient
Computer Virus.

02:32.965 --> 02:34.482
- Ooh, sounds scary.

02:34.551 --> 02:36.241
- Pfft, only if you're
obsessed with the internet.

02:36.310 --> 02:37.482
- I am.

02:37.551 --> 02:38.793
It's where
my girlfriend lives.

02:38.862 --> 02:40.896
Hi, Tracy426!
If you're watching this,

02:40.965 --> 02:43.793
I'm probably gonna be
logging on late tonight.

02:43.862 --> 02:45.482
- No, you won't.

02:45.551 --> 02:47.172
Because that virus
is nasty stuff.

02:47.241 --> 02:49.482
It's going to destroy the
internet for the entire world.

02:49.551 --> 02:52.379
- And I think what our viewers
really want to know now is

02:52.448 --> 02:54.172
are you single?

02:54.241 --> 02:55.448
- I'm half robot.

02:55.517 --> 02:57.586
- Answer the question.

02:58.172 --> 03:00.551
- Are you watching
"Dog Judge" on your phone?

03:00.620 --> 03:02.241
- Yeah, I've seen this one
before, it's a good one.

03:02.310 --> 03:03.448
What's robot guy saying?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.137
- [zapping]
- Ow!

03:05.206 --> 03:07.241
I'm okay.

03:07.310 --> 03:09.862
- He's going to access
a satellite above Swellview

03:09.931 --> 03:12.482
so he can take out
the world's internet.

03:12.551 --> 03:15.172
- No, he won't,
'cause we're gonna stop him.

03:15.241 --> 03:17.482
Schwoz, how do we stop him?
- Yeah, is there any way

03:17.551 --> 03:19.172
you can find the satellite
he's talking about?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.000
- Sorry, guys.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.000
I usually can figure out
how to solve any problem

03:24.068 --> 03:26.620
but there are literally
thousands of satellites

03:26.689 --> 03:28.137
circling the Earth.

03:28.206 --> 03:30.241
It would take years to--

03:30.310 --> 03:31.931
oh, got it.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.517
[all cheering]

03:34.586 --> 03:36.448
- Took you long enough.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.103
- Now we can take out
that satellite.

03:38.172 --> 03:40.689
- Wait, even if we do
take out that satellite,

03:40.758 --> 03:43.620
who's gonna take out that
freaky Cyborg Rick Twitler?

03:43.689 --> 03:46.344
- Right.

03:46.413 --> 03:48.275
- I am.

03:48.344 --> 03:49.551
I'm gonna teleport down there

03:49.620 --> 03:51.413
and kick that
wannabe-robot's ro-butt.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.620
- Can you even teleport
that far?

03:52.689 --> 03:54.448
- I'm finna find out.

03:54.517 --> 03:56.034
- That is such
a brave move, dude.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.931
You know, if you don't make it,
you could end up

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
frozen and floating
through space forever.

04:01.068 --> 04:02.413
- I think you mean

04:02.482 --> 04:04.965
we could end up
floating through space forever.

04:05.034 --> 04:06.620
- Wait, what?
- You're comin' with me.

04:06.689 --> 04:08.413
- No, no, no, no--

04:08.482 --> 04:10.137
- They're gonna make it, right?

04:10.206 --> 04:11.448
- Well...
- Right?

04:11.517 --> 04:14.275
- Yeah, hey, yeah,
they're gonna make it.

04:14.344 --> 04:15.517
And if they don't,

04:15.586 --> 04:18.000
Ray has clones of all of us.

04:18.068 --> 04:19.517
- Just in case.

04:27.689 --> 04:30.241
- Did we make it?
- I think we did!

04:30.310 --> 04:31.551
[groaning]

04:31.620 --> 04:34.310
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

04:34.379 --> 04:37.172
Moldy cheese table?

04:39.586 --> 04:40.965
Handsome Hero Hair Dye?

04:41.034 --> 04:43.413
Are we in one of Ray's
trash rockets?

04:43.482 --> 04:45.137
- Look! It's the drawing I made

04:45.206 --> 04:46.931
for his Christmas present.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.379
He must've accidentally
thrown it away.

04:49.448 --> 04:53.620
- Yeah, accidentally.

04:53.689 --> 04:55.206
- So we didn't make it
back to Swellview?

04:55.275 --> 04:58.517
- No, but there's so many
of Ray's trash rockets

04:58.586 --> 05:00.034
out here in space,

05:00.103 --> 05:02.034
we might be able to rocket hop
the rest of the way!

05:02.103 --> 05:04.206
- Yes, and we can pick up
any other art

05:04.275 --> 05:05.448
that I made for you guys
that might've gotten

05:05.517 --> 05:06.551
thrown away accidentally.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.517
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:08.586 --> 05:10.517
Accidentally.

05:14.068 --> 05:16.448
- Not a lot of fun being
strapped to a chair is it?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.448
- Shut up!
- [grunts]

05:18.517 --> 05:19.620
- How is strapping me
to a chair

05:19.689 --> 05:21.000
gonna get us
to hit that satellite?

05:21.068 --> 05:22.689
- Remember earlier
when you superscreamed

05:22.758 --> 05:23.931
and you and Drex
flew up into the ceiling?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.620
- I remember it.
- I said shut up!

05:25.689 --> 05:26.896
- [grunts]

05:26.965 --> 05:28.310
- Well, this is
kind of like that,

05:28.379 --> 05:29.896
except the Man's Nest is you,

05:29.965 --> 05:32.103
and the satellite we need
to take out is the ceiling.

05:32.172 --> 05:33.344
- Still not getting it

05:33.413 --> 05:36.517
and Swellview.com
voted me the smart one.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.793
- Okay, we're gonna drop you
down into space,

05:38.862 --> 05:40.206
and since you're attached
to the Man's Nest

05:40.275 --> 05:41.517
when you superscream,

05:41.586 --> 05:43.103
it's gonna propel us
into the satellite.

05:43.172 --> 05:44.517
- Hopefully.

05:44.586 --> 05:47.137
- Isn't it gonna be
freezing cold out in space?

05:47.206 --> 05:49.965
- We got you a scarf.

05:50.793 --> 05:52.965
- You guys are sure
I'm not gonna die out there?

05:53.034 --> 05:56.103
- Yeah, you can last
15 seconds in space.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.586
- Not feeling
100% confident here.

05:58.655 --> 05:59.896
- Neither are we.

05:59.965 --> 06:01.344
Anyway,
before we drop you down,

06:01.413 --> 06:03.275
Schwoz is gonna tell you
which direction to shout.

06:03.344 --> 06:04.896
- Is there gonna be some
sort of countdown?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.068
- No time.
Scream us to the left!

06:07.137 --> 06:09.344
- Ahh!

06:09.413 --> 06:12.586
[screams]

06:19.241 --> 06:21.310
[shivering] So cold!

06:21.379 --> 06:23.862
- Oh.

06:23.931 --> 06:27.172
Forgot to give you
these mittens.

06:27.241 --> 06:30.620
- Scream 45 degrees
to the right!

06:31.689 --> 06:34.896
[screams]

06:39.275 --> 06:41.862
- Oh, wow, you're
doing great, buddy.

06:41.931 --> 06:44.689
- [shivering]
Grandma, is that you?

06:44.758 --> 06:46.172
- One more superscream.

06:46.241 --> 06:48.931
Straight ahead to give us
ramming speed!

06:49.000 --> 06:51.965
- Did you lose my mittens?

06:52.034 --> 06:53.275
Whoa!

06:53.344 --> 06:56.103
[both scream]

07:05.448 --> 07:08.172
- [shivering] I'm okay!

07:09.379 --> 07:10.827
- She did it.

07:10.896 --> 07:13.448
ShoutOut put us right on course
to hit the satellite!

07:13.517 --> 07:14.862
- Hey, way to go!

07:16.413 --> 07:18.068
- Oops.

07:19.448 --> 07:21.103
Sorry.

07:21.172 --> 07:24.103
- [shivering]
Don't do that again.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.448
- How long until impact?

07:28.517 --> 07:30.344
- Not long, baby.

07:30.413 --> 07:31.586
According to my calculations,

07:31.655 --> 07:33.206
we're going to smash
that satellite

07:33.275 --> 07:36.551
going eleventy brazillion miles
per hour.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.689
- And that'll destroy it?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.724
- Shoosh, yeah!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.482
That satellite's a gonner.

07:41.551 --> 07:42.793
We're going to hit it harder

07:42.862 --> 07:46.034
than a construction worker
on payday.

07:46.103 --> 07:49.034
- And the Man's Nest
will be okay?

07:49.103 --> 07:50.586
- Well...

07:50.655 --> 07:53.068
- Tell us the truth, Schwoz.
- Yeah.

07:53.137 --> 07:55.379
Tell us the Man's Nest
is gonna be okay.

07:55.448 --> 07:56.586
- Make up your mind, man.

07:56.655 --> 07:58.000
You want me
to tell you the truth

07:58.068 --> 08:00.310
or tell you the Man's Nest
is gonna be okay?

08:00.379 --> 08:01.931
Because it's--
- What are you talking--

08:02.000 --> 08:04.827
- Impact with satellite
in two minutes.

08:04.896 --> 08:07.068
It was nice knowing you.

08:07.137 --> 08:10.413
- [laughs]
You guys are gonners!

08:10.482 --> 08:12.413
- Ay!

08:13.689 --> 08:16.034
- It all just kinda happened.

- [sighs] I know.

08:41.758 --> 08:42.931
- If you're just joining us,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.275
a cyborg version
of Rick Twitler

08:45.344 --> 08:46.758
has tied us up with rope.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.034
- The itchy kind!

08:49.103 --> 08:51.448
- And is about to access
the giant satellite dish

08:51.517 --> 08:53.103
on the roof of KLVY

08:53.172 --> 08:55.137
to beam down
his sentient virus.

08:55.206 --> 08:57.793
- And take down the internet.

It's gonna take
a miracle to stop him.
