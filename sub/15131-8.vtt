00:07.353 --> 00:09.488
No, you're back. Damn it.

00:09.555 --> 00:10.856
Just the welcome I dreamed of.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.257
No, I meant to call you. I'm so sorry.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.526
[Chuckles] You got held
up. It's totally all right.

00:14.594 --> 00:15.927
So, you took a taxi.

00:15.961 --> 00:19.264
How was the, uh, flight and
your dad and the wedding?

00:19.298 --> 00:20.632
Yes, I did take a taxi,

00:20.700 --> 00:22.534
it was a little bit turbulent,
and it's a long story.

00:22.602 --> 00:23.968
You know what? You look so busy.

00:24.036 --> 00:24.969

- I am.

It's bananas around here this morning.

Joel, you've never gotten me
a present in your entire life.

What are you talking
about? I've definitely...

00:37.449 --> 00:38.582
you know, you don't deserve it.

00:38.650 --> 00:41.118
I know I don't, but I want it anyway.

It's the least I can do

I'm not working today.

You do know I'm not supposed
to be here today, right?

Believe me, I would not have paged you

01:43.326 --> 01:44.560

and a little insulting.

- Who is she?
- Selena something?

01:49.432 --> 01:50.799
Selena.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.167
Yes, well, this is her elbow.

01:52.201 --> 01:54.002
Could be dislocated, but it's hard to tell.

02:02.878 --> 02:04.112
No, actually, it's not.

02:04.146 --> 02:05.813
I'm surprised you didn't
just stitch yourself up.

02:05.847 --> 02:08.183
- What happened?
- I fell off my bike.

02:08.217 --> 02:09.184
And got the door prize.

02:09.217 --> 02:10.351
And now the slowest doctor

02:10.386 --> 02:12.853
in the free world is
keeping me from my patients.

02:12.888 --> 02:15.056
Good news for you, you do
not have a dislocated elbow,

02:15.091 --> 02:17.825
but you have a nasty
bump here on your head.

02:17.859 --> 02:19.359
You're definitely gonna need a C.T.

02:19.394 --> 02:20.761
[Sighs] No, no, no. I'm fine.

02:20.796 --> 02:22.162
- I'm fine.
- No, no, no, no, no. You are not fine.

Yes.

02:32.874 --> 02:34.141
And all my back-ups are busy,

02:34.175 --> 02:35.875
so if I don't go, my clinic doesn't open.

open the clinic up for me?

- Come on. What's the worst that could happen?
- Does that hurt?

02:47.222 --> 02:49.456
I mean, I guess a guy could
pull a knife on me again.

02:49.491 --> 02:50.690
Again?

02:50.725 --> 02:51.992
- Well.
- Are you sure?

It's just that Mondays are total chaos.

go to bed, go to sleep.

- Sold.

the bleeding. I'm sorry.

- She jumped off the garage

- On concrete?

you is best for your son.

08:15.053 --> 08:17.487
Yeah, but it's a stranger's breast milk.

08:17.521 --> 08:19.422

09:09.639 --> 09:10.739
so you got to get me some to go.

09:10.773 --> 09:11.906

I won't be here tomorrow.

Wow. That's weird.

15:46.531 --> 15:48.298
[Sighs]

15:48.366 --> 15:51.668
At least I didn't land
on my face, though, right?

15:51.736 --> 15:52.936
Who are you calling?

15:52.970 --> 15:54.971
Uh, someone who can
hopefully save your life.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.173
Nice.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.078
Hey. I was just looking for
you when I got your text.

16:02.146 --> 16:03.980
She should be awake now, shouldn't she?

16:04.048 --> 16:05.380
- Yeah, we missed something.
- What?

16:05.784 --> 16:07.851
She landed on her abdomen
before she fell in the pool.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.782
The ultrasound was clear

16:08.817 --> 16:10.384
and her brother said
she landed on her feet.

16:10.451 --> 16:12.085
Yeah, I don't think he's
the most reliable witness.

16:12.153 --> 16:14.354
Now, since it's not blood in her abdomen,

16:14.422 --> 16:15.989
could it be something else?

16:16.057 --> 16:18.925
If the pancreas was
damaged, it wouldn't show up.

16:21.129 --> 16:22.129
[Sighs]

16:22.163 --> 16:23.497
The bruising wasn't there before.

16:23.531 --> 16:24.964
I'll book a C.T. and get
her in as soon as possible.

16:24.999 --> 16:25.965
Thank you.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.001
You're welcome.

16:28.069 --> 16:30.570
[Monitor beeping]

16:30.638 --> 16:31.738
Milo in trouble?

16:38.111 --> 16:39.378
[Sighs]

16:39.413 --> 16:40.647
You're a list-maker.

16:40.714 --> 16:42.081
[Chuckles]

16:42.149 --> 16:44.316
If you want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans, right?

16:44.384 --> 16:45.852
Baby's doing great.

16:45.886 --> 16:46.986
He's the only one.

16:47.021 --> 16:48.987
Washing machine... I got to fix that.

16:49.022 --> 16:51.057
Cloth diapers... what was I thinking?

16:51.091 --> 16:52.891
Have you picked a name yet?

16:52.959 --> 16:54.093
I don't know.

16:54.127 --> 16:57.163
We're thinking maybe Dylan or Ezra, maybe?

16:57.197 --> 16:58.564
Ezra Zarb?

16:58.598 --> 16:59.698
I know. Too many Z's, right?

16:59.732 --> 17:00.732
But still, Dylan?

17:00.767 --> 17:02.901
Mm, I was Devon for four weeks

17:02.936 --> 17:05.637
before my mom decided I was a Margaret.

17:05.704 --> 17:07.305
You'll have time.

17:07.373 --> 17:08.740
We're gonna keep him in the NICU

17:08.808 --> 17:10.508
until you're both ready to go home, so...

17:11.578 --> 17:13.211
And then that's it.

17:13.244 --> 17:14.345
What do you mean?

17:15.647 --> 17:17.816
Well, for Lara.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.685
I have to say goodbye.

17:21.186 --> 17:24.122
I mean, I know she's
already clinically, but...

17:24.156 --> 17:27.023
I thought maybe we'd have some time to...

17:27.059 --> 17:28.425
What?

17:28.461 --> 17:32.029
I don't know, just after
the baby was born...

17:32.064 --> 17:35.900
I thought maybe we'd get to spend some...

17:35.934 --> 17:37.802
No, you can say goodbye.

17:37.836 --> 17:39.269
However you want.

17:39.304 --> 17:41.872
You just... you let me
know how you want it to go.

17:47.679 --> 17:49.714
Do you have a sec?

17:49.748 --> 17:51.882
I need your advice.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.550
Jimmy: Just suck it up, say you're sorry.

17:53.585 --> 17:54.718
She's only trying to help.

17:54.752 --> 17:56.286
It's not life or death.

17:56.321 --> 17:57.887
Maggie: Yeah, it is.

17:57.922 --> 17:58.888
<i>It's life and death.</i>

17:58.956 --> 18:00.290
His baby is gonna be born today,

18:00.358 --> 18:02.526
and his wife is about to
be taken off life support.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.761
How do you help someone
with something like that?

18:06.731 --> 18:08.298
Oh, you're talking about David Zarb.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.333
Mm-hmm.

18:10.367 --> 18:13.402
Help him stay focused on life.

18:13.437 --> 18:15.438
Thanks.

18:15.806 --> 18:17.540
Uh, who am I supposed to apologize to?

18:17.574 --> 18:19.275
Uh, check your e-mail.

18:19.343 --> 18:20.409
And, Maggie.

18:20.444 --> 18:21.745
Mm?

18:21.779 --> 18:24.681
Don't get sucked into the shame.

18:24.715 --> 18:26.915
Okay.

18:32.322 --> 18:33.756
- You were right.
- Pancreas?

18:33.790 --> 18:35.724
Grade III injury with a huge hematoma.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.126
- So she's been leaking fluid?
- For hours.

18:37.161 --> 18:39.061
We're going in now to patch it up.

18:39.095 --> 18:40.229
Good catch, Dr. Harris.

18:40.264 --> 18:41.664
Nice work, Dr. Reid.

18:41.698 --> 18:44.967
I am literally... I am
freaking out about these boards.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.168
For the next three months,

18:46.235 --> 18:47.803
it's all work and no play for this guy.

18:47.871 --> 18:49.038
Oh, my God.

18:49.105 --> 18:50.139
Speaking of play, do you know what I heard?

18:50.173 --> 18:51.940
- Is this about me?
- No.

18:52.008 --> 18:54.316
Alex and hot, hot Dr. "G."

18:54.326 --> 18:56.344
Everyone knows about that.
Alex is sleeping with Dr. Goran.

18:56.379 --> 18:58.213
<i>Like, they've been doing it.</i>

19:05.079 --> 19:06.813
Just look at Grady.

19:06.881 --> 19:08.582
He's just so sweet.

19:08.649 --> 19:09.816
Where's my sister?

19:09.850 --> 19:12.218
I thought you were finished with her legs?

19:12.286 --> 19:13.820
Grady: We were hoping we could see her.

19:13.888 --> 19:15.088
Oh, God, no. No, no.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.056
You can't let Grady see me like this.

19:17.091 --> 19:18.324
I am so gross.

19:18.392 --> 19:20.093
Your sister's back in the O.R.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.562
Her condition is, uh, more
serious than we thought.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.264
Now, you guys want to tell
me what really happened?

19:25.299 --> 19:27.833
What do you mean? She
jumped off the roof...

19:27.867 --> 19:29.001
And landed on her stomach.

19:29.069 --> 19:32.438
Well, I... I didn't see it.

19:32.473 --> 19:36.108
I was supposed to be watching
her, but I... I wasn't.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.111
Was she drinking?

19:39.145 --> 19:41.012
No. Definitely not.

19:41.046 --> 19:42.581
Well... a little.

19:42.648 --> 19:43.615
What?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.450
- Uh-oh.
- I'm so stupid.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.285
She was following me
around, asking for sips.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.920
You gave my little sister alcohol?

19:48.954 --> 19:50.922
Well, she was driving me nuts.
She wouldn't leave me alone.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.290
You said I was cute.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.625
- What did you do?
- I... I'm sorry.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.726
I told her to do it.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.628
I saw those other girls up on the roof

19:56.662 --> 19:58.763
jumping into the pool, and I told Tatum...

19:58.797 --> 20:00.865
"Bet you could do a way
cooler jump than any of them."

20:00.933 --> 20:02.233
I just wanted to get rid of her.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.434
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.036
I... I'm so sorry.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.804
He wanted to get rid of me.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.606
If she dies,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.474
it's your fault.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.744
[Whimpers]

20:16.248 --> 20:18.115
I'll never forgive myself.

20:23.522 --> 20:27.724
[Speaking Arabic]

20:27.759 --> 20:30.060
Okay, this isn't broken,

20:30.094 --> 20:33.163
but it is badly bruised, all right?

20:33.197 --> 20:37.768
So we'll just keep it taped
up like this for a few days.

20:37.802 --> 20:40.503
This should heal up very nicely.

20:40.538 --> 20:42.705
- [Speaking Arabic]
- You're done.

20:47.611 --> 20:51.314
No more flipping the bird for you.

20:51.348 --> 20:53.316
You gonna let her talk to me like that?

20:53.350 --> 20:54.551
So, you feeling better?

20:54.618 --> 20:55.985
- Oh, I'm good now.
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.053 --> 20:58.154
You're a right miracle worker, aren't you?

20:58.222 --> 21:00.923
You got my last miracle.
That's all you're getting.

21:00.957 --> 21:03.092
You'll be in my prayers.

21:03.126 --> 21:05.494
I'm sure I will. Get out of here.

21:11.134 --> 21:12.902
Hey, I'm Dr. Goran.

21:14.304 --> 21:15.270
Hey, Chief.

21:15.305 --> 21:17.772
What is it?

21:19.576 --> 21:20.742
What'd you do to my arm?

21:20.810 --> 21:22.311
What, are you in pain or?

21:22.345 --> 21:23.712
And my leg.

21:23.746 --> 21:25.347
It's all zooey. What are you...

21:25.381 --> 21:26.981
- [gasps]
- Hey!

21:30.520 --> 21:32.120
Teddy?

21:32.154 --> 21:34.789
[Monitor beeping]

21:36.846 --> 21:39.414
Careless answer, unprofessional demeanor.

21:39.449 --> 21:40.615
You read my e-mail.

21:40.650 --> 21:41.717
It's so humiliating.

21:41.751 --> 21:43.318
You sent it to Dr. Bell, Dr. Hamza...

21:43.353 --> 21:45.253
every single staff surgeon in the hospital.

21:45.321 --> 21:47.155
- Why would you do that?
- It's my job.

21:47.189 --> 21:48.622
So "Dr. Lin is in no way prepared

21:48.690 --> 21:49.790
to sit her surgical board"?

21:49.859 --> 21:50.624
Which is true.

21:50.692 --> 21:52.460
It was one question.

21:52.527 --> 21:53.995
You gave a two-word answer
and made a joke out of it.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.496
That's not acceptable.

21:55.530 --> 21:57.932
- You know me. I knew the answer.
- Well, you didn't give it.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.201
If you answer your exam
questions like that, you'll fail.

22:00.269 --> 22:02.270
It's my job to teach you.
Don't take it so personally.

22:02.338 --> 22:03.371
You're teaching a person.

22:03.438 --> 22:04.538
- I have feelings.
- Yeah, about that.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.973
I'm gonna ask you to keep Mr. Zarb company

22:06.040 --> 22:07.007
while I'm operating.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.376
What is that teaching me, exactly?

22:08.443 --> 22:10.344
To keep your feelings out of the O.R.

22:14.182 --> 22:16.116
So really see if you can grip them.

22:16.184 --> 22:17.418
Okay.

22:17.486 --> 22:19.186
So it's just weakness
down one side of your body?

22:19.220 --> 22:20.254
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:20.321 --> 22:22.089
Now try to smile for me, Teddy.

22:23.291 --> 22:27.227
That stuff you gave me...
it only half worked, Chief.

22:27.295 --> 22:30.463
I'm not complaining. I
loves me my lorazepam.

22:30.498 --> 22:31.731
Hi, Selena.

22:31.799 --> 22:33.066
No, it's not Selena. I'm
calling a neurosurgeon.

The chief of the chiefs.

22:35.503 --> 22:38.405
Shahir. Yeah, I... I need your help.

22:38.439 --> 22:40.673
Can't diagnose from a distance, Joel.

22:40.741 --> 22:41.908
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

22:41.975 --> 22:43.242
I've already called an ambulance,

22:43.277 --> 22:44.844
because initially this was
just a withdrawal thing.

22:44.879 --> 22:46.546
I got a patient here.
She's already had a seizure.

22:46.580 --> 22:47.747
She has a persistent headache

22:47.782 --> 22:49.015
and numbness all down one side of her body.

22:49.082 --> 22:50.316
She needs a C.T.

22:50.350 --> 22:51.384
Is her headache getting worse?

22:51.419 --> 22:52.652
Well, it's difficult to tell, man.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.186
I can barely understand what she's saying.

22:54.221 --> 22:56.289
I don't like guessing.

22:56.356 --> 22:59.392
Could you please try?

22:59.459 --> 23:02.161
Worst-case scenario, she
has an intracerebral bleed.

23:02.195 --> 23:03.896
Okay, so what can I do about that?

23:03.964 --> 23:05.131
<i>You can't do anything.</i>

23:05.198 --> 23:07.433
I can fix it if you bring her here in time.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.035
Before the deficits
become permanent, right?

23:09.069 --> 23:10.403
Well, if it's what you're describing,

23:10.470 --> 23:12.504
she'll be dead in an hour.

23:12.539 --> 23:14.606
Okay, I'm gonna get her to you asap.

23:14.641 --> 23:18.176
Okay, the ambulance should
be arriving pretty soon.

Where's Teddy?

23:22.816 --> 23:25.417
Leo, where did Teddy go?

23:26.953 --> 23:28.153

Hey, listen to me. I'm
not playing games here.

23:30.589 --> 23:32.623
Tell me where she's gone.

That bus left years ago.

23:34.393 --> 23:36.027
The funeral?

23:36.062 --> 23:37.628
Her grandfather died and she never went,

23:37.663 --> 23:39.397
and she's been messed
up about it ever since.

23:39.432 --> 23:41.967
Listen to me very carefully.
She's extremely ill, okay?

23:42.001 --> 23:43.734
If you care for her, you will talk to me.

23:43.769 --> 23:45.202
Now... [Pounds table]

23:45.236 --> 23:46.571
... where could she be?

23:48.907 --> 23:50.541
Check the train bridge at South Street.

23:50.576 --> 23:51.542
Is that where she lives?

23:51.577 --> 23:53.644
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

Teddy, it's Dr. Goran. Can you hear me?

I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

24:35.619 --> 24:36.552
No.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.221
- Can you sit up for me?
- No.

24:38.288 --> 24:39.455
- Yes.
- No.

24:39.490 --> 24:41.657
It's all right. I'm
gonna get you out of here.

24:41.691 --> 24:43.592
I'm gonna get you to Fredericton, okay?

24:43.627 --> 24:44.660
Come on.

24:44.694 --> 24:46.195
I'm gonna get you to Fredericton.

24:46.230 --> 24:48.464
- 2:00, right?
- Mm.

Yes, there is. Okay, get the suction ready.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.835
We're gonna get into
some serious hemorrhage.

25:12.903 --> 25:15.103
Retractor.

25:17.941 --> 25:20.809
Look at that pancreas...
fractured and bleeding.

25:20.844 --> 25:21.911
What about the spleen?

25:21.978 --> 25:23.445
That'll be re-sectioned, too.

25:23.479 --> 25:24.746
Metz.

25:24.813 --> 25:27.082
That's not all gonna fit in there.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.816
Her guts... there's too much swelling.

25:28.884 --> 25:30.218
- You can't close.
- I agree.

25:30.286 --> 25:32.421
We leave the incision open,
wrap her, finish tomorrow.

25:32.488 --> 25:34.256
We do that and we risk a
whole host of complications

25:34.290 --> 25:35.924
while she sits with her
abdomen open overnight.

25:35.958 --> 25:37.259
It's the safe choice, Dr. Reid.

25:37.276 --> 25:40.212
- Airway pressures are going up.
- She's young. Her fascia's healthy.

25:40.246 --> 25:42.246
It's safer to close now than put
her through another operation.

25:42.314 --> 25:43.948
I agree with Rian. I think we should wrap.

25:43.983 --> 25:45.016
Enough!

25:45.083 --> 25:46.150
Someone needs to make a decision.

25:46.184 --> 25:47.752
Should we get a staff surgeon in here?

25:47.820 --> 25:50.855
Yes. Call Dr. Harris. She's his patient.

25:54.793 --> 25:56.761
I'm literally freezing.

25:56.795 --> 25:59.497
You are literally in surgery.

25:59.564 --> 26:02.166
I wish I had Grady's hoodie.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.767
- [Sighs]
- Wait a second.

26:03.835 --> 26:04.902
What?

26:04.936 --> 26:06.537
Why was Grady trying to get rid of me?

26:06.571 --> 26:08.438
Maybe because you wouldn't stop talking.

26:08.472 --> 26:11.074
And where was Milo? Why
wasn't he watching me?

26:11.108 --> 26:13.744
Maybe he didn't think
you'd do anything stupid.

26:13.778 --> 26:15.646
You know what's stupid?

26:15.680 --> 26:16.947
Kissing Tag.

26:16.981 --> 26:18.649
Those girls started it earlier

26:18.716 --> 26:20.417
and I don't know, maybe Milo...

26:20.451 --> 26:23.053
Was chasing girls instead of
watching his annoying sister?

26:23.087 --> 26:24.854
Milo? No, never. He doesn't like girls.

26:24.888 --> 26:26.722
Oh. Oh.

26:28.659 --> 26:30.260
Wait, that's it.

26:30.294 --> 26:34.964
Grady was trying to get rid
of me so he could be with Milo.

26:34.998 --> 26:37.366
Oh, he gave him his hoodie.
How could I not have seen it?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.500
Charlie...

26:38.535 --> 26:40.636
just hold that thought.

26:40.671 --> 26:42.137
Staple.

26:42.172 --> 26:44.807
What's going on?

26:44.841 --> 26:46.308
There's more swelling than we anticipated.

26:46.342 --> 26:47.944
Dr. Harris, I think we
should wrap the abdomen

26:47.978 --> 26:49.144
and send the patient up to ICU.

26:49.179 --> 26:50.145
She's getting cold.

26:50.213 --> 26:51.447
Which is why we need to finish.

26:51.481 --> 26:53.048
Charlie, I have a gut feeling about this.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.183
We should close right now.

26:54.217 --> 26:55.984
I look like an exploded burrito.

26:56.018 --> 26:57.119
The organs are too swollen.

26:57.153 --> 26:58.720
- Let's go, people.
- I'm getting dizzy.

26:58.754 --> 27:00.722
Rian: Dr. Harris.

27:02.024 --> 27:03.892
Alex, it's your call.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.860
We should close.

27:05.895 --> 27:08.029
Okay. Close her up.

27:08.064 --> 27:09.965
- Wait. That's it. You're leaving?
- No, I'm scrubbing in.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.633
[Sighs] Get me the fish.

27:11.701 --> 27:12.767
Fish?

27:12.835 --> 27:14.869
What, you're gonna put a fish in me?

27:14.904 --> 27:16.204
Char... Charlie?

27:16.238 --> 27:17.639
[Siren wails]

27:17.707 --> 27:21.109
[Radio chatter]

27:21.143 --> 27:23.377
Okay, one milligram lorazepam,
nothing else that I know of.

27:23.445 --> 27:24.980
Okay, O.R. 3. I'll take it from here.

27:25.014 --> 27:26.114
She's conscious,

27:26.181 --> 27:27.448
but the whole right side of her body is...

27:27.483 --> 27:28.649
I'll keep you posted.

27:28.683 --> 27:30.084
Okay, well, I'm not going anywhere, Shahir.

27:30.119 --> 27:33.187
[Radio chatter]

27:33.222 --> 27:34.455
[Sighs]

27:34.523 --> 27:39.494
Okay, my guts are hanging
out all over the place.

27:39.561 --> 27:42.229
Do they even know what they're doing?

27:42.263 --> 27:44.331
Sometimes there's more
than one way to proceed,

27:44.398 --> 27:46.533
so they just needed
someone to help them choose.

27:46.567 --> 27:47.901
The pretty one's the best, though, right?

27:47.969 --> 27:49.737
Her name is Dr. Reid,

27:49.771 --> 27:51.772
and they are all excellent doctors.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.976
Okay, well, if Dr. Reid had
said to do the other thing,

27:56.011 --> 27:58.112
you still would have agreed
with her, though, right?

27:58.146 --> 27:59.346
[Sighs]

27:59.380 --> 28:00.747
[Giggles]

28:00.781 --> 28:02.349
I'm right, aren't I?

28:02.416 --> 28:05.585
You need to get your
priorities straight, young lady.

28:09.237 --> 28:11.037
Alex: Okay.

28:12.805 --> 28:13.607
She's holding on.

28:13.674 --> 28:15.808
Time to close.

28:15.876 --> 28:16.976
[Monitor beeping]

28:17.044 --> 28:18.377
It's time to push down.

28:18.445 --> 28:19.378
Suture.

28:19.446 --> 28:20.479
[Alarm beeps]

28:20.513 --> 28:21.680
Airway pressure is still climbing.

28:21.749 --> 28:23.415
Almost 30. It's getting hard to ventilate.

28:23.483 --> 28:24.516
Push down right there.

28:27.354 --> 28:28.221
Put that back in!

28:31.524 --> 28:33.659
Come on, Rian. Put your back into it.

28:33.693 --> 28:34.793
Yep.

28:34.861 --> 28:35.861
Like you're packing a suitcase. Push.

28:35.928 --> 28:38.096
- 40.
- [Beeping continues]

28:49.041 --> 28:50.108
You okay?

28:50.176 --> 28:51.209
Yeah.

28:53.246 --> 28:54.946
You're almost there.

28:56.282 --> 28:59.251
Here we go. Take the fish out.

29:03.722 --> 29:05.189
- Voilà.
- [Sighs]

29:05.257 --> 29:06.324
Dr. Boyden?

29:06.358 --> 29:08.192
Pressure's stabilizing.

29:08.226 --> 29:09.594
You did it.

29:16.802 --> 29:18.436
Here you are. They're looking for you.

29:18.470 --> 29:20.104
We're about to take Lara into the O.R.

29:21.606 --> 29:23.140
I know.

29:24.776 --> 29:27.044
I should be pacing the halls,
puffing on a cigar, right?

29:27.078 --> 29:28.279
[Chuckles]

29:28.313 --> 29:30.214
Somehow I just don't feel like it.

29:30.248 --> 29:33.083
What's all this?

29:33.118 --> 29:34.618
The day she found out she was pregnant,

29:34.652 --> 29:35.953
she started packing this bag.

29:37.755 --> 29:39.389
Socks.

29:39.424 --> 29:42.192
She thought her feet might
get cold in the stirrups.

29:42.226 --> 29:43.193
Smart.

29:43.227 --> 29:45.094
[Both chuckle]

29:46.997 --> 29:49.199
Lara's grandmother knit this blanket.

29:49.233 --> 29:52.902
She brought her mother home
from the hospital in it.

29:52.937 --> 29:56.039
Then her mother used it when Lara was born.

29:56.073 --> 30:00.643
And Lara wanted to use
it for our baby, too.

30:00.677 --> 30:01.911
For Ezra.

30:03.314 --> 30:05.348
It's amazing that she kept it.

30:06.616 --> 30:10.286
Meant a lot to her.

30:10.321 --> 30:15.157
Family.

30:15.191 --> 30:17.326
Who is this guy?

30:17.361 --> 30:19.027
That's mine.

30:19.095 --> 30:21.430
His, um, name is Mr. Weezaloops.

30:21.465 --> 30:23.198
[Both chuckle]

30:23.233 --> 30:24.633
Little dude has seen it all.

30:24.668 --> 30:26.969
Has he ever seen a baby being born?

30:27.036 --> 30:28.503
I thought I wasn't allowed in there.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.873
No one said you can't
watch through the door.

30:32.275 --> 30:35.677
I bet he's tougher than he looks.

30:35.711 --> 30:37.946
Come on.

30:40.749 --> 30:43.285
I'm never waking up.

30:43.353 --> 30:44.853
[Sighs]

30:44.887 --> 30:45.920
Why should I?

30:45.988 --> 30:46.988
I mean...

30:47.022 --> 30:49.056
I'm in love with a gay man.

30:49.124 --> 30:51.426
And I ruined my brother's life.

30:51.494 --> 30:53.595
God, I'm a study in tragedy.

30:53.662 --> 31:00.001
You are so young.
There's gonna be plenty...

31:00.035 --> 31:02.669
A few quality boys in your future.

31:02.704 --> 31:05.039
It's not puppy love.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.341
I hate that.

31:07.409 --> 31:09.377
It's real.

31:09.444 --> 31:11.879
Well, real love with
someone who loves you back...

31:11.947 --> 31:13.881
that's gonna happen for you someday.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.749
You promise?

31:17.485 --> 31:19.019
I'm sure of it.

31:20.855 --> 31:22.790
And it won't hurt like this, right?

31:22.857 --> 31:24.691
Oh...

31:24.759 --> 31:25.893
I can't promise you that.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.595
[Chuckles, sniffles]

31:28.663 --> 31:31.097
[Telephone rings]

31:34.501 --> 31:35.701
Do you have a pen?

31:35.769 --> 31:37.370
What?

31:37.405 --> 31:38.939
I need you to do something for me.

31:38.973 --> 31:40.506
Where's your... your pen and that
little pad thing you write on?

31:40.674 --> 31:43.609
Yeah. Come on. I need it. I have an idea.

31:47.014 --> 31:48.281
So, the heart rate monitor

31:48.349 --> 31:50.115
will say if he's in trouble, right?

31:50.183 --> 31:52.518
Yeah, and Dr. Katz is
watching it very carefully.

31:52.586 --> 31:53.886
That's the pediatrician.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.321
And those people?

31:55.355 --> 31:56.556
The NICU team.

31:56.590 --> 31:59.492
They're gonna put him in the incubator?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.026
In the humidicrib, yeah, to keep him warm.

32:01.094 --> 32:02.895
But he could be just fine, right?

32:02.963 --> 32:04.864
I mean, I know he's gonna be small,

32:04.932 --> 32:07.232
- but he could...
- Absolutely.

32:08.935 --> 32:11.236
[Sighs] I can't see anything.

32:11.271 --> 32:12.471
What's happening now?

32:12.538 --> 32:14.706
Dr. Katz is about to make the incision.

32:14.740 --> 32:17.609
Okay, come on, Ezra.

32:17.643 --> 32:19.744
They're gonna hold him up,
right, when they take him out?

32:19.779 --> 32:21.280
You know what? You should be in there.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.814
You should not be shut out of this.

32:34.193 --> 32:36.427
Gown them.

32:39.598 --> 32:41.366
Thank you so much.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.800
Oh, uh...

32:42.834 --> 32:43.934
[Chuckles]

32:43.969 --> 32:46.137
I've never been so scared in my life.

32:46.171 --> 32:48.306
My pleasure. She's a tough little lady.

32:48.340 --> 32:50.008
I'll check on her in a bit.

32:53.178 --> 32:55.079
Thanks for having my
back in there, Charlie.

32:55.114 --> 32:56.179
Well, it was a good call,

32:56.214 --> 32:57.648
and you did great, as usual, Alex.

32:59.350 --> 33:00.851
Oh. He's coming. Charlie, do it now.

33:03.688 --> 33:05.055
Grady: Hey.

33:05.089 --> 33:06.557
Uh, I heard she's gonna be all right.

33:06.591 --> 33:08.592
What are you still doing here?

33:08.627 --> 33:13.030
I just came back to get my hoodie.

33:13.064 --> 33:15.032
Sorry.

33:22.873 --> 33:25.509
She's gonna need a lot of recovery time,

33:25.543 --> 33:27.277
but she's young.

33:27.311 --> 33:28.578
She's gonna bounce right back.

33:28.612 --> 33:30.246
He read it, Charlie. We got to...

33:30.280 --> 33:31.247
- And I need to go.
- You got to...

33:31.281 --> 33:32.849
yeah, we got to go.

33:34.818 --> 33:36.419
I feel the same way about you.

33:36.486 --> 33:37.754
What?

33:37.788 --> 33:40.857
I got your note.

33:40.891 --> 33:42.025
I love you, too.

33:42.092 --> 33:44.594
You have terrible handwriting, by the way.

33:44.662 --> 33:48.264
Yes! It worked! Yes! I knew it.

33:48.298 --> 33:51.667
Holy moly. Who is that?

33:53.503 --> 33:55.104
Oh, no. No, hey!

33:55.138 --> 33:56.439

Welcome, little one. [Chuckles]

Mr. Zarb, would you like to do the honors?

34:29.705 --> 34:31.572
Come on.

34:51.493 --> 34:54.995
Congratulations.

34:55.029 --> 34:56.263
Okay.

34:56.331 --> 34:59.566
He's all yours.

35:03.605 --> 35:04.771
Why isn't he crying?

35:09.376 --> 35:10.944

Right on cue. [Chuckles]

35:17.818 --> 35:19.085
We'll deliver the placenta now.

35:19.153 --> 35:20.887
Where am I supposed to be at?

35:20.921 --> 35:22.756
I don't know where I should go.

35:22.790 --> 35:25.291
I think he's calling your
name. Go be with your son.

35:25.359 --> 35:27.059
Okay, but Lara.

35:27.093 --> 35:28.361
Her vitals are all over the place.

35:28.395 --> 35:30.229
I can't stabilize her.

35:30.264 --> 35:32.465
Wait, what's happening?
What... what's going on?

35:32.499 --> 35:33.966
There's no time. You
have to say goodbye now.

35:34.034 --> 35:36.536
What? No.

35:36.570 --> 35:39.138
I... I'm not ready.

35:39.173 --> 35:41.140
This is not how it was supposed to go.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.107
I know. I know.

36:00.422 --> 36:02.290
Here.

36:02.324 --> 36:04.292
Thank you.

36:04.326 --> 36:08.763
I thought you might want
to be together as a family.

36:08.797 --> 36:11.499
[Chuckles]

36:11.533 --> 36:12.800
What I wanted.

36:12.834 --> 36:18.605
This is all happening earlier
than you expected. I'm sorry.

36:20.549 --> 36:22.282
I came to see her every day.

36:23.852 --> 36:26.386
And the baby was growing.

36:29.458 --> 36:32.560
And all along, even though
I told myself not to...

36:36.164 --> 36:38.398
... I was hoping she'd wake up.

36:40.801 --> 36:43.971
[Inhales raggedly, sighs]

36:44.005 --> 36:46.606
I was waiting for a miracle.

36:52.646 --> 36:54.481
This is your miracle.

36:56.450 --> 36:57.684
Right here.

37:13.166 --> 37:16.369
[Monitor beeping]

37:16.436 --> 37:19.005
<i>Grady: I was looking for you.</i>

37:19.072 --> 37:21.974
You were playing Tag. [Chuckles]

37:22.042 --> 37:25.544
It's dumb, but I knew you
were it, and I was hoping...

37:27.547 --> 37:28.914
I was looking for you, too.

37:38.992 --> 37:40.958
You're it.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.063
You guys are the cutest couple ever.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.701
[Ezra squeaks]

37:52.638 --> 37:55.540
[Chuckles]

38:11.557 --> 38:13.723
[Telephone rings]

38:16.361 --> 38:17.894
You were hard on me today.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.298
"All things be ready, if the mind be so."

38:21.366 --> 38:22.399
Who said that?

38:22.434 --> 38:23.800
Shakespeare.

38:23.834 --> 38:24.868
Or Yoda.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.370
[Chuckles]

38:29.507 --> 38:31.374
So, what, you're just toughening me up?

38:31.408 --> 38:34.510
I like you, but I'm still your boss.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.112
You're a hard ass.

38:36.180 --> 38:38.448
I'm into that.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.249
Obstetrics isn't for babies.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.755
You were great with Mr. Zarb.

38:48.325 --> 38:51.394
I might have been hasty
in sending that e-mail.

38:51.428 --> 38:53.296
Thanks.

38:57.534 --> 38:58.734
It was a good day.

39:19.755 --> 39:22.290
Hi.

39:22.325 --> 39:23.891
Want some?

39:23.926 --> 39:27.996
I know about you and Joel.

39:35.505 --> 39:39.674
What can I tell you? That's, um...

39:39.742 --> 39:41.275
Well, it's a nightmare.

39:43.112 --> 39:44.812
I...

39:46.448 --> 39:49.751
I wish that I could... explain it, but...

39:49.818 --> 39:51.653
Don't explain it.

39:51.687 --> 39:53.854
I don't want to know.

39:53.921 --> 39:57.057
That's none of my business.

39:58.693 --> 40:00.727
I've been trying to find a way to tell you.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.467
But...

40:06.501 --> 40:07.535
[Sighs]

40:07.602 --> 40:10.737
We were getting along so well and...

40:10.772 --> 40:12.005
It was good.

40:12.073 --> 40:15.341
Yeah, it was good.

40:17.979 --> 40:20.413
I guess I just need to accept that

40:20.447 --> 40:23.650
that's all it's gonna be from now on.

40:29.156 --> 40:31.424
I... I don't understand.

40:31.458 --> 40:32.659
[Sighs]

40:32.693 --> 40:37.163
I mean, what we had,
it was everything to me.

40:37.198 --> 40:39.699
[Sighs]

40:39.766 --> 40:43.969
And the fact that it's
just... just gone for you...

40:47.473 --> 40:51.744
... and that you can just
move on with... with him.

40:58.484 --> 41:01.152
It's like I don't even
know you anymore, and it...

41:04.424 --> 41:05.657
[Sighs]

41:05.692 --> 41:08.360
And it breaks my heart.

41:09.662 --> 41:12.097
I don't want to break your heart, Charlie.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.102
Well, you can't.

41:20.572 --> 41:22.774
Because you are my heart, Alex.

41:28.047 --> 41:30.314
My whole heart.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.152
You're it for me.

41:37.155 --> 41:38.756
[Sighs]

41:38.790 --> 41:41.058
What can I do?

41:43.295 --> 41:45.630
You can buy me out of the condo.

41:45.664 --> 41:48.398
Okay.

41:48.432 --> 41:52.202
Because the thought of you
there with him is just...

41:52.237 --> 41:54.337
[sighs]

41:56.507 --> 41:59.309
That was our home.

42:02.380 --> 42:04.414
- If that's what you want.
- It's what I want.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.888
Deal?

42:11.922 --> 42:13.923
Deal.

42:32.295 --> 42:33.395
You don't have to wait.

42:33.430 --> 42:35.197
Shahir said it could be awhile yet.

42:35.232 --> 42:36.799
No, no, it's okay. I want to be here.

42:36.834 --> 42:38.167
Thank you for calling.

42:38.235 --> 42:40.102
Freaking Teddy. [Chuckles]

42:40.137 --> 42:42.338
Nearly lost her.

42:42.372 --> 42:44.806
Joel, you found her.

42:44.841 --> 42:48.010
Listen, you did way more
than most people would...

42:50.046 --> 42:51.813
... a thousand times more
than I expected of you.

42:59.455 --> 43:00.555
Selena, um...

43:02.659 --> 43:04.993
That was for Teddy.

43:17.672 --> 43:18.972
Every time that you're
bored you want something new,

43:19.073 --> 43:19.939
you want something better.

43:20.041 --> 43:21.007
That is not fair.

43:21.108 --> 43:22.342
It's happening again.

43:23.844 --> 43:25.712
Go out on a limb.

43:25.813 --> 43:27.113
That's where the fruit is.

43:28.115 --> 43:29.583
Are you married?

43:29.684 --> 43:30.984
It's complicated.

43:31.085 --> 43:32.586
Yeah, it's complicated.

43:33.688 --> 43:34.721
Why don't you move in with me?

43:34.822 --> 43:36.022
[Laughs]

43:37.024 --> 43:38.058
Come up to my room.
