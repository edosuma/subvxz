So therefore, Danny,
I give you three weeks in the pit.

18:59.603 --> 19:01.973
Wow. Great job.

19:01.998 --> 19:05.376
- And, Owen, you'll be joining him.
- What?!

19:05.401 --> 19:08.203
You were complicit in his
lies since the very beginning.

19:08.228 --> 19:10.428
- Makes you an accomplice.
- This is insane.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.767
Just serve the time, Owen.

19:12.792 --> 19:15.427
Do the right thing.

19:16.069 --> 19:19.937
Okay, Steve, how about you
take a big shit into your hands

19:19.962 --> 19:21.853
and then eat it with your own face?

19:21.878 --> 19:23.654
'Cause we're not gonna go in your pit.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.113
- [All gasping]
- A bit foul.

19:25.968 --> 19:27.935
But don't make me think of banishment

19:27.961 --> 19:29.580
because I'm...  I'm gonna consider it.

19:29.605 --> 19:31.612
Owen, please,
if we're both in the pit together...

19:31.637 --> 19:32.329
It's okay.

19:32.354 --> 19:34.540
Yeah, you don't have
to consider it, okay?

19:34.565 --> 19:37.865
Because right now,
I'm banishing myself and Danny

19:37.890 --> 19:40.845
because we would rather go live
on the other side of this island

19:40.871 --> 19:43.705
and focus on what's important,
which is getting home.

19:43.730 --> 19:46.179
Once you leave, you can never return.

19:46.204 --> 19:47.595
No, I understand what banishment is

19:47.620 --> 19:49.023
'cause I just banished myself.

19:49.048 --> 19:51.432
- Right.
- Danny, you ready to go?

19:53.020 --> 19:55.610
Daniel, you don't have
to listen to this.

19:55.635 --> 19:57.350
He's... He's confused, I think.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.681
If I was you, I'd stay.

19:58.706 --> 20:02.154
We've got a nice, warm pit here for you.

20:03.216 --> 20:05.291
Okay, let's go.

20:05.316 --> 20:07.923

Holy shit. You are an asshole.

20:39.567 --> 20:40.800
Florence!

20:40.825 --> 20:41.516
Emma?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.805
Good news... I was
right. It was Mengshu.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.496
What? Isn't that awesome?

20:45.521 --> 20:49.129
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, also, Yolonzo's dead.

20:49.154 --> 20:50.296
- Oh.
- [Coughing]

20:50.320 --> 20:52.903
- Oh, my God!
- [Gagging]

20:52.928 --> 20:54.713
What a shit!

20:54.779 --> 20:56.691
Help!
