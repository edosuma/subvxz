I will <i>never</i> forgive you for this!

16:32.075 --> 16:34.369
This will <i>never</i> be okay.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.125
What the fuck did you do, Lucas?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.045
How you doing there, Clare-Bear?
Been a long time.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.464
- Go to the car, Rae.
- What? No.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.716
- Nice to see you again.
- Do not talk to her!

16:47.716 --> 16:48.884
LUCAS:
It's not what you think.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.011
He's different.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.222
Oh, he-- he is? It's bullshit.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.432
He's changed. Clare, he's sober.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.642
CLARE:
Oh, did he tell you that?

16:56.642 --> 16:57.768
And you believed him?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.479
You are such a fuckin' idiot.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.565
Why don't we just go up to the house?
And then we can talk.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.692
CLARE:
Why are you here? This is not your home.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.361
You are not <i>welcome</i> here!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.656
- It is.
- What?

17:10.656 --> 17:12.407
- It is his.
- What? I can't hear you, Lucas.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.952
I bought the house. It's ours.
I bought it from Luke.

17:16.328 --> 17:19.331
Anytime you wanna come up,
bring your family--

17:19.331 --> 17:22.376
You sold Mom's home to her abuser?

17:22.376 --> 17:24.294
- He's-- He's our dad.
- Abuser? Is that what you think?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.672
Yes! I know it! Because I was there!

17:26.672 --> 17:28.173
You were a child, you don't remember--

17:28.173 --> 17:32.135
Oh, you pulled Mom
off of her bed by her hair.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.595
You broke her pinkie.

17:33.595 --> 17:37.057
You smashed her dishes
because you didn't like her spaghetti!

17:37.057 --> 17:39.184
Listen, he saved Mom's house.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.519
It was gonna be foreclosed on.

17:40.519 --> 17:43.188
I gave you that money
out of her college tuition.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.356
LUCAS:
It wasn't enough!

17:44.356 --> 17:46.817
You act like
you did me some kind of favor,

17:46.817 --> 17:48.277
you know, giving me this place.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.863
He doesn't love you, Lucas.
You know that, right?

17:50.863 --> 17:53.031
- CLARE'S DAD: That's enough.
- This man does not love you!

17:53.031 --> 17:54.616
You don't even know that.
CLARE: Yes. Oh, I do!

17:54.616 --> 17:56.743
You think that this man
could love anything?
- Just, just stop.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.329
CLARE: You think
he is capable of loving anything?
- That's enough.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.583
- He doesn't know how to <i>love.</i>
- Just stop.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.669
Mom told us to forgive.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.797
- That people can change--
- Oh, you think she was talking about <i>him?</i>

18:08.797 --> 18:11.216
- Before she died, she said--
- Don't talk to me about before she died.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.136
- You weren't fucking there!
- Stop holding that over me!

18:15.512 --> 18:16.805
It's not like you were some saint.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.807
And neither was Mom.

18:18.807 --> 18:19.892
What are you talking about, Lucas?

18:19.892 --> 18:21.768
You hold her up on--
on some kind of pedestal...

18:21.768 --> 18:24.104
CLARE: Why would you
ever say that about her?
- ...like she was this <i>perfect</i> person.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.190
- You can stop right now!
- There's more than
your side of the story!

18:26.190 --> 18:27.691
Stop fucking talking!

18:27.691 --> 18:30.903
Both of you stop talking.
Okay, it's over. It's done.

18:30.903 --> 18:34.239
We're not gonna settle this tonight.
Let's just-- Just let it lay.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.869
CLARE:
Wow. I should've known.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.081
Should've never given you anything. Ever.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.000
- Fuck you.
- Yeah. Fuck you!

18:46.084 --> 18:48.337
- My marriage is over because of you!
- What?

18:48.337 --> 18:51.131
I wasn't with Mom when she died
because of you!

18:51.131 --> 18:53.383
No! You weren't there because of you.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.969
It was your <i>fucking</i> choice.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.638
Nobody asked you to come get me.

18:57.638 --> 19:01.016
Nobody. Not me. Not Mom.
That was fucking on you.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.810

Just go to the car, Rae!

19:13.529 --> 19:14.530
This isn't over.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.323
This is not over.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.164
Ain't it crazy
how 50 years just flies by?

19:29.002 --> 19:32.172
I still remember the day
that you were born, Clare.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.302
And you haven't changed a bit.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.474
This isn't your house.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.355
And if you hurt him,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

any-- any word of that.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.404
This is all my fault!

20:38.071 --> 20:39.489
What are you saying?

20:39.489 --> 20:41.867
I told Uncle Lucas about the money.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.328
Ab-- Ab-- About the college fund.
I told him.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.079

Uh, we were just texting
and-- and it just came out,

20:49.791 --> 20:51.210
and I didn't think it was a big deal.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.378
But then he asked you for it.

20:53.378 --> 20:58.133
And then-- And then Dad got so mad,
and you just left--

20:58.133 --> 21:01.386
- No, Rae. No, Rae. That's not--
- You guys kept fighting and I didn't--

21:18.320 --> 21:22.157
But look--
But, hey, that is not your stuff.

21:23.325 --> 21:26.495
None of this is your fault. Okay?
