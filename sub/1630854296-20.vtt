[weights clanking]

00:21.758 --> 00:23.655
[indistinct chatter]

00:23.758 --> 00:25.689
BODE:
There it is.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.620
Did you see that?

00:28.586 --> 00:31.000
She just slipped a bag
of pills into his pocket.

00:31.103 --> 00:33.448
Sleeper taught me that trick.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.758
FREDDY: Got to say,
your taste in friends?

00:35.862 --> 00:38.689
Much improved since Lompoc.

00:40.379 --> 00:42.896
With that fresh stash,
Sleeper will have enough

00:43.000 --> 00:44.241
to get twice as
many guys hooked

00:44.344 --> 00:46.689
on his supply
by the end of the week.

00:47.689 --> 00:49.586
Don't get involved, Bode.

00:50.862 --> 00:52.758
You're too close to paroling.

00:52.862 --> 00:55.103
I'm the reason he came.

00:55.206 --> 00:57.275
I'm gonna be
the reason he leaves.

00:57.379 --> 00:58.689
What did you do
to him in Lompoc

00:58.793 --> 01:01.172
that put this target
on your back?

01:02.172 --> 01:04.620
I was his right-hand man
until I wasn't.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.482
He'll never forgive me
for leaving.

01:09.448 --> 01:11.827
I brought this curse on you.

01:11.931 --> 01:13.310
On the camp.

01:13.413 --> 01:14.965
Don't worry about me.

01:15.068 --> 01:16.413
Sleeper thinking I'm on his side

01:16.517 --> 01:18.586
after that fake fight
of ours has its perks.

01:18.689 --> 01:20.517
I've been able to read
my daughter a bedtime story

01:20.620 --> 01:23.586
every night
on his contraband phone.

01:26.862 --> 01:28.758
What happens when he asks you

01:28.862 --> 01:30.033
to have Cookie mule for him?

01:30.137 --> 01:31.379
Bode.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.827
I told you
I could take care of myself.

01:36.206 --> 01:37.827
As long as Sleeper's here,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.033
you're not safe.

01:39.137 --> 01:40.793
Camp's not safe.

01:43.068 --> 01:44.689
I'm stopping him.

01:55.000 --> 01:55.827
Hey, Sleeper.

01:55.931 --> 01:57.448
Not so fast, Leone.

01:58.241 --> 02:01.103
[grunting]

02:07.068 --> 02:08.655
Stay down.

02:12.310 --> 02:14.413
[panting]

02:16.517 --> 02:19.344
You ordered
an egg white omelet?

02:19.448 --> 02:21.724
We burned, like,
about two pizzas' worth

02:21.827 --> 02:22.862
of calories in that pool.

02:22.965 --> 02:24.137
More like two doughnuts.

02:24.241 --> 02:25.965
Which I'm having
after the omelet.

02:26.068 --> 02:27.896
[both laugh]

02:28.000 --> 02:29.517
Um, so when do you leave?

02:29.620 --> 02:31.793
Your diving clinic's
over, right?

02:31.896 --> 02:34.413
Yeah, but I'm in no rush.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.137
I'm honestly
loving Edgewater.

02:37.413 --> 02:40.758
You? Mr. "If the city
ain't big enough

02:40.862 --> 02:42.862
to host the Olympics,
it ain't big enough for me"?

02:42.965 --> 02:44.965
A guy can change.

02:45.067 --> 02:49.862
2.5 kids, dog,
Little League Sundays.Uh-huh.

02:49.965 --> 02:50.965
I could be
seduced into it.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.896
[laughs]

02:53.689 --> 02:55.758
Just got to find
me a nice girl.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.724
Like your dad did.

02:59.827 --> 03:01.931
[Faye and Manny laugh]

03:02.034 --> 03:03.965
I'm so happy for him.

03:04.068 --> 03:05.896
WAITER:
Thanks, here you go.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.448
[gasps]Let me take care
of this one for once.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.655
Uh-oh. Is this
when I discover

03:11.758 --> 03:13.068
you've been
secretly bothered

03:13.172 --> 03:14.655
by our reverse pay
gap all along?

03:14.758 --> 03:16.275
[both laugh]

03:16.379 --> 03:18.896
You still not tempted to come
make stupid money with me?

03:20.310 --> 03:21.965
Look, I would...

03:22.068 --> 03:23.241
[sighs]

03:23.344 --> 03:25.103
I would love to come
work for you.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.586
I just...

03:26.689 --> 03:29.034
I hate the idea
of ditching my guys.

03:29.137 --> 03:31.310
Then don't.
Bring them with you.

03:31.413 --> 03:33.862
Just say the word
and I'll loop my people in.

03:39.103 --> 03:40.000
Hey.

03:40.103 --> 03:41.724
Hey-o.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.413
Oh, you still working
on Freddy's case?Mm-hmm.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.137
I thought, uh, the lawyer from
Lighthouse Amends was on it.

03:49.241 --> 03:50.930
Well, she is,
but she's swamped,

03:51.034 --> 03:52.586
and Freddy can use all
the help he can get.

03:52.689 --> 03:55.965
He took a bad plea deal
just because

03:56.067 --> 03:57.241
he was falsely accused

03:57.344 --> 03:58.793
of robbing
a jewelry store.

03:58.896 --> 04:01.172
Right. That and he
didn't have an alibi.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.862
Objection. He had one, but
he didn't have the proof.

04:04.965 --> 04:06.896
He was helping a pedestrian
after a car crash,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.172
and I'll be damned
if I can't find proof.

04:10.275 --> 04:11.413
Would you like help, Sherlock?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.275
Yes, please.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.724
Come on. [chuckles]

04:14.827 --> 04:18.793
I'll do the pedestrian claim,

04:18.896 --> 04:21.481
and you can do
the truck driver's.

04:21.586 --> 04:22.586
Thanks, Watson.

04:22.689 --> 04:25.206
Seriously. Thank you.

04:25.310 --> 04:26.482
Yeah, well, you know,

04:26.586 --> 04:28.034
it's easy to have
each other's back

04:28.137 --> 04:30.103
when you're in
a good place, so...

04:30.206 --> 04:31.931
"Good place"?

04:32.034 --> 04:33.206
Is that what you're calling it,
even though

04:33.310 --> 04:34.931
you haven't forgiven the Leones?

04:37.965 --> 04:39.103
[groans]: Okay.

04:39.206 --> 04:41.448
Ha, you funny.

04:41.551 --> 04:43.965
Let's not talk about it
while they're right here.

04:44.068 --> 04:46.137
It's good to see the two
of them back to normal.

04:46.241 --> 04:51.103
You think things will ever be
normal with Jake between us?

04:51.206 --> 04:53.551
Well, we've apologized
about a million times.

04:53.655 --> 04:55.000
I don't know what
else we can do.

04:55.103 --> 04:56.482
Right.

04:57.344 --> 04:59.310
Vinny boy! [laughs]

04:59.413 --> 05:01.310
Come on, bring it in!

05:01.413 --> 05:04.482
[Walter laughing]

05:04.586 --> 05:06.689
Papa Leone!

05:06.793 --> 05:07.620
[laughter]

05:07.724 --> 05:08.689
Oh, how you doing, handsome?

05:08.793 --> 05:10.413
I heard you get a new truck.

05:10.517 --> 05:11.517
Oh.
Oh, Bertha and Lucille.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.758
WALTER: Come on.JAKE: Come on.

05:12.862 --> 05:13.551
Yeah, let's see.Come on, let's see 'em.

05:13.655 --> 05:15.275
I can't wait...

05:15.379 --> 05:17.551
to hear why you
brought Dad here.

05:17.655 --> 05:19.965
Uh...
[clears throat]

05:20.068 --> 05:21.655
Luke.

05:21.758 --> 05:23.655
[sighs]
Well, like I said,

05:23.758 --> 05:27.172
over text and email
and with food delivery,

05:27.275 --> 05:28.620
I'm sorry.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.275
Yeah.

05:30.379 --> 05:34.000
Most people don't say "I'm sorry
for hitting on you" with soup.

05:34.103 --> 05:35.724
Well, I thought flowers
would be awkward.

05:35.827 --> 05:36.931
[laughs]

05:37.034 --> 05:38.206
Yeah, they would.

05:38.310 --> 05:39.517
So is this.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.379
I'm not doing it.

05:44.379 --> 05:45.413
Hasn't my son taught you
any of the tricks

05:45.517 --> 05:46.896
about cleaning these things?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
By tricks, do you mean
yelling at the probies?

05:49.103 --> 05:51.724
No, baking soda and toothpaste.
Works magic.

05:51.827 --> 05:53.241
All right, let's get
back to it, man.

05:53.344 --> 05:54.517
All righty.All right.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.172
We'll leave you, Papa Leone.All right.

05:56.275 --> 05:58.482
Luke, how you doing, man?

05:58.586 --> 06:00.206
What you got over here?

06:00.310 --> 06:02.206
[indistinct chatter]

06:02.310 --> 06:03.482
What is this?

06:03.586 --> 06:04.758
Why is he here?
Why are you here?

06:04.862 --> 06:06.551
You think I want
to be here, hmm?

06:06.655 --> 06:08.379
45 minutes
in the car with Dad,

06:08.482 --> 06:09.896
I have to listen
to him regurgitate

06:10.000 --> 06:11.689
the same old stories
I've heard a million times?

06:11.793 --> 06:14.206
I'm at the end of
my rope here with him.

06:14.310 --> 06:17.448
Okay. So what's the deal?

06:17.551 --> 06:20.206
He fell down
the front porch steps again.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.862
Doctor says he
needs hip surgery,

06:21.965 --> 06:23.000
he keeps refusing.

06:23.103 --> 06:24.344
I'm asking you to please

06:24.448 --> 06:26.655
just help me convince him
to get this surgery.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.310
Well, you know he hates it
when we gang up on him.

06:31.413 --> 06:32.344
[sighs]

06:32.448 --> 06:33.689
I'm in.

06:33.793 --> 06:34.862
It's not that we're
ganging up on him.

06:34.965 --> 06:36.827
We'll present him
with a unite...

06:36.931 --> 06:38.827
Did you just say you're in?

06:42.655 --> 06:44.103
Hey, you brave enough
to have a little talk

06:44.206 --> 06:47.000
without your new converts?

06:47.103 --> 06:47.965
What you want?

06:48.068 --> 06:49.413
I want you to get rid of it.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.689
These guys can't be getting
messed up, going into fires.

06:51.793 --> 06:53.586
That's how people get killed.

06:53.689 --> 06:56.827
You got to cut everybody off.

06:56.931 --> 06:57.862
Or what?

06:57.965 --> 06:59.275
You're gonna go running to Cap?

07:00.310 --> 07:03.724
I know you remember
how I handle snitches.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.137
And their loved ones.

07:07.068 --> 07:08.517
[grunting]

07:08.620 --> 07:10.620
Don't ever threaten my people.

07:10.724 --> 07:13.965
LONNEGAN: Sleeper.Leave him. Leave him.

07:16.517 --> 07:19.206
He's right.

07:20.448 --> 07:22.034
I should cut people off.

07:22.862 --> 07:24.206
Starting with Freddy.

07:25.689 --> 07:27.482
His phone
privileges?

07:27.586 --> 07:29.655
They're over.

07:29.758 --> 07:32.000
Why? What does he got
to do with this?

07:32.103 --> 07:34.344
Oh, you don't think I know
about your little ruse?

07:34.448 --> 07:38.172
You forget that I taught you
everything you know.

07:38.275 --> 07:39.862
Everything.

07:41.517 --> 07:42.724
See you around.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.344
[laughter]

07:51.448 --> 07:52.724
Well, he's in good spirits
right now.

07:52.827 --> 07:54.000
There's no better time
to strike. Let's do this.

07:54.103 --> 07:55.000
[clears throat]

07:55.103 --> 07:56.862
What's with these young punks?

07:56.965 --> 07:59.482
All they want to do is talk
about "work-life balance."

07:59.586 --> 08:00.551
I don't know what that is.

08:00.655 --> 08:02.275
All they need is firefighting.

08:02.379 --> 08:03.758
VINCE:
Um...

08:03.862 --> 08:04.793
Heard about your fall.

08:04.896 --> 08:06.241
Well, falls, plural.

08:06.344 --> 08:07.448
[grunts]

08:07.551 --> 08:09.068
Yeah, okay, I know
what's going on.

08:09.172 --> 08:10.724
This is probably
your idea, wasn't it?

08:10.827 --> 08:13.275
Now, come on, you're
taking me home right now.

08:13.379 --> 08:16.034
I don't believe it. No, no.[stammers] Dad,
hold on a second.

08:16.137 --> 08:17.551
Just get... [groans]Hold on, let's talk about it.

08:17.655 --> 08:20.448
Dad!
Dad, Dad, hey.

08:20.551 --> 08:22.310
[groans]You all right?

08:22.413 --> 08:23.758
DISPATCHER: Vegetation fire.Let's get him up.

08:23.862 --> 08:25.620
Wolfe Mine, 614 Walnut Ridge.

08:25.724 --> 08:27.896
Oh, my God, Walter,
what happened?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.034
Don't you even think about

08:29.137 --> 08:30.793
getting on that engine,
all right?

08:30.896 --> 08:32.827
He's your dad, too, man.Okay, he might need stitches.

08:32.931 --> 08:35.309
You go to the ER
and I'll handle the call.

08:35.413 --> 08:37.275
Come on.
Easy, easy, easy.

08:37.379 --> 08:39.793
I got you.[grunts]

08:39.895 --> 08:43.655
[indistinct radio transmission]

08:44.655 --> 08:46.862
Neighbor heard an explosion.

08:46.965 --> 08:49.000
Looks like something
detonated inside the mine.

08:51.413 --> 08:53.413
Okay, I want two lines.

08:53.517 --> 08:56.275
Run a hose team
on the structure

08:56.379 --> 08:58.896
and another on these spot fires
in the brush.Chief.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.758
Where do you want us?Three Rock.

09:00.862 --> 09:03.034
All these spot fires, they're
creeping toward the tree line.

09:03.137 --> 09:05.793
Not if my guys can help it.
Four-foot scrape

09:05.896 --> 09:07.655
between those flames
and those trees.

09:07.758 --> 09:08.655
¿Me entiendes?

09:08.758 --> 09:09.655
Let's move.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.206
[overlapping chatter]

09:12.448 --> 09:13.862
Hey.Hey.

09:13.965 --> 09:15.379
Your hearing is
in seven days.

09:15.482 --> 09:16.586
Not that I'm counting.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.310
We can't be seen
talking like this.

09:19.413 --> 09:21.206
Okay, Sleeper can't know
that we're together.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.758
What does he care?

09:22.862 --> 09:24.793
Listen, I-I don't want you
to become a target in this.

09:24.896 --> 09:27.965
You got to stay away for now.

09:32.413 --> 09:33.758
MANNY:
Yo, where you at?
Pull this back.

09:33.862 --> 09:36.137
Big Mike, help him out.

09:39.551 --> 09:40.793
What could have exploded
in there?

09:40.896 --> 09:43.103
I thought this mine
was abandoned decades ago.

09:43.206 --> 09:46.448
Yeah, but every couple of years
some DIY miner

Hey! Can you hear me?!

SHARON: Greencrest,
this is Wolfe Mine I.C.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.862
I have a collapse
and at least one person trapped.

10:18.965 --> 10:21.655
Send an engine and the nearest
mine rescue team.

10:21.758 --> 10:23.793
Stop! We move too fast,

10:23.896 --> 10:26.482
we cause another collapse

Hey.

Just want the doctor.

No, he wasn't drunk.

How many times do I need
to apologize here?

Yeah, Vince never met

Hey, Walter.

What?What happened?

11:38.862 --> 11:40.344
Gravity and old age.

11:40.448 --> 11:42.379
The nurse said this is
probably just a concussion, so

I don't know what the
hell I'm doing in here.

11:44.448 --> 11:47.000
Well, he's leaving out the part
that he has fallen four times

11:47.103 --> 11:49.206

to get hip surgery.

no cameras in the area.

And that woman that you helped,
was she able to ID you?

an hour late to work.

more rubble to clear

12:52.827 --> 12:54.517
before we can get her out,

12:54.620 --> 12:56.310
but these struts, they can
only stabilize so much.

12:56.413 --> 12:58.344

else to shore it up?

And, Manny, I'm gonna need you
for something else now.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.586
These cuts have to be precise.

13:16.689 --> 13:19.551
These makeshift posts are gonna
help hold up that collapse.

13:19.655 --> 13:21.068
First post is done, Cap.

Let me do it.

13:28.620 --> 13:30.068
What?Let me do it.

13:30.172 --> 13:31.965
I got it, Sleeper. I got it.

13:32.068 --> 13:34.068
What are you doing, man?

13:34.172 --> 13:35.448
What are you doing?

13:35.551 --> 13:36.551
Hey! Hey!

13:36.655 --> 13:38.379
What's going on? Hey. Come on.

13:38.482 --> 13:39.620
What are you doing, man?

13:39.724 --> 13:41.655
Lonnegan's got
his saw certification.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.344
You don't.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.689
Sleeper, hand him
back the saw.

13:46.931 --> 13:48.137
[revs]

13:50.793 --> 13:52.413
It is.

13:52.517 --> 13:53.862
And I'm winning.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.620
We're gonna need a medic.

13:56.724 --> 13:58.206
GABRIELA: Hey.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.310
Bode.

14:00.413 --> 14:03.103
You okay?Your boy here's got
a little nick.

14:03.206 --> 14:04.448
Hazard of the job,
you know?

14:04.551 --> 14:06.448
I'm fine. It's fine.
I'm fine.
No.

No, you're not. Let's go.

14:07.655 --> 14:09.413
Come on. Come on.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.241
Great work, Three Rock!
Let's go!

14:16.344 --> 14:18.034
Okay, collapse
is stable? Okay, go.

14:18.137 --> 14:19.448
Go, be very careful.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.758
We got her!

14:21.862 --> 14:23.310
SHARON:
Okay.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.241
She's breathing!

Wait.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.620
Wait, if Gail's the troop
leader, then where's the troop?

14:36.724 --> 14:37.827
GAIL:Still...

14:37.931 --> 14:39.620
in there.

14:39.724 --> 14:42.172
[coughing]

14:49.551 --> 14:51.310
The blast was so loud
and it was dark

14:51.413 --> 14:52.551
and I lost my three Explorers.

14:52.655 --> 14:54.068
Hey, it's not your fault.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.172
Okay, we're gonna do
everything we can now.

14:56.931 --> 14:58.689
Chief.

14:58.793 --> 15:00.689
Mine collapsed
deeper in,

15:00.793 --> 15:02.724
but there is a path large
enough to squeeze through.

15:02.827 --> 15:04.103
Okay. Greencrest,

15:04.206 --> 15:06.862
what's the ETA on
the mine rescue team?

15:06.965 --> 15:09.482
DISPATCH: Mine rescue
still four to six hours out.

15:11.517 --> 15:14.896
Okay, this is not
an order, this is an ask.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.068
We can wait for
the mine rescue team.

15:18.172 --> 15:19.862
Yeah, well, imagine
how scared those kids are.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.862
And if they're injured, waiting
is only gonna make it worse.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.586
I'm going in.

15:24.689 --> 15:26.344
Me too. We're a team.

15:29.655 --> 15:30.827
Okay.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.137
Ready?Ready, ready.

15:32.241 --> 15:34.241
You be so safe.

15:35.827 --> 15:38.034
Eve, let's go.

15:38.758 --> 15:39.655
It's okay.

15:47.758 --> 15:51.206
What exactly happened
just now with Sleeper?

15:52.517 --> 15:54.068
This gash, Bode.

15:54.172 --> 15:56.620
I'm not... I'm not
doing this again.

15:56.724 --> 15:58.103
Okay? I...

15:58.206 --> 16:00.034
promised you I'd keep
you out of camp politics.

16:00.137 --> 16:02.482
Are you in danger?

16:05.448 --> 16:06.827
Bode, if we're
gonna be normal

16:06.931 --> 16:11.068
so soon after you get out,
then I-I need something.

16:13.034 --> 16:15.379
Sleeper has a new stash at camp.

16:16.551 --> 16:19.275
Freddy and I saw
the drop this morning.

16:20.724 --> 16:22.103
We're gonna stop him.

16:22.931 --> 16:26.034
"We" as in
you and Freddy?

16:26.137 --> 16:27.551
There's a code in here.

16:27.655 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, no snitching.
I know the code, Bode.

16:31.517 --> 16:34.413
But you're focusing
on camp politics

16:34.517 --> 16:37.034
when you should
be focusing...

16:37.137 --> 16:39.000
on your transition
out of there.

16:39.103 --> 16:41.965
Into the real world.

16:43.862 --> 16:45.241
With me.

16:49.034 --> 16:50.275
Hey.

16:51.724 --> 16:53.724
Do you want to be a civilian

16:53.827 --> 16:55.482
or an inmate?

16:56.793 --> 16:59.034
It's time to choose.

17:04.172 --> 17:06.792
Uh, if we convince him
to get this surgery,

17:06.896 --> 17:09.517
then what, hm?

17:09.619 --> 17:12.000
I mean, he probably
moves in with one of us.

17:12.103 --> 17:14.586
Most likely me, of course.

17:15.862 --> 17:17.448
What?Would it kill you?

17:17.550 --> 17:18.896
To do one selfless thing
for this family?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Here we go.

17:21.103 --> 17:23.378
I mean, it's not like my wife's
got kidney disease

17:23.482 --> 17:25.482
or my kid's incarcerated or...

17:27.378 --> 17:29.310
You heard what's going on
with Jake, right?

17:29.413 --> 17:31.103
Yeah, I know, and you
lost your daughter

17:31.206 --> 17:33.379
and your life is very
full and important

17:33.482 --> 17:34.896
and mine is small
and meaningless, right?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.689
Okay, you gonna start playing
that dusty old song again?

17:38.793 --> 17:40.655
Come on, you...
You're the one that chose

17:40.758 --> 17:42.034
to move closer to Dad.

17:42.137 --> 17:45.000
I am asking my big
brother for help here,

17:45.103 --> 17:47.551
Vince, okay? I'm trying to
be a part of this family again

17:47.655 --> 17:50.034
but God forbid that you or
Dad should make that easy.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.655
Or even tolerable.

17:55.586 --> 17:58.137
All right, yeah, you're right.
I-I got it.

17:58.241 --> 18:00.517
Thank you.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.965
Hi. Walter's head CT is clear.

18:05.068 --> 18:06.586
But he'll stay overnight
for observation.

18:06.689 --> 18:08.758
Well, you can keep him as long
as you want. [chuckles]

18:08.862 --> 18:10.310
It could have been a lot worse.

18:10.413 --> 18:12.551
And these falls
will keep happening.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.448
I have been trying
to convince him,

18:14.551 --> 18:17.620
his doctors have been telling
him about this for months now.

18:17.724 --> 18:18.931
Uh, years.

18:19.034 --> 18:21.103
I spoke with Walter's PCP.

18:21.206 --> 18:22.724
The surgery
is two years overdue.

18:24.586 --> 18:26.275
If your dad puts this
off much longer,

18:26.379 --> 18:28.241
he might not be able
to walk at all.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.551
JAKE:
Hello? Can you

18:32.655 --> 18:34.344
hear us?

18:34.448 --> 18:36.517
The dynamite looks amateur.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.275
I guess DIY miners
were down here after all.

18:40.137 --> 18:42.724
Okay. Hey, Command?

18:42.827 --> 18:44.310
We got stores
of dynamite down here.

18:44.413 --> 18:47.137
Our culprits must have
abandoned this place

18:47.241 --> 18:48.965
after the blast went sideways.

18:49.068 --> 18:51.379
SHARON:
Copy. Just keep a lookout
for other victims in there.

18:51.482 --> 18:52.896
Copy.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.068
All right, so, are we
gonna talk about this

18:56.172 --> 18:59.310
non-hug with Sharon
out there,

18:59.413 --> 19:01.689
Mister "I'm in a good place"?

19:01.793 --> 19:04.827
Okay, look, I want to
forgive them, I do, but...

19:04.931 --> 19:07.000
look what happens

19:07.103 --> 19:08.965
when I actually mess up.

19:09.068 --> 19:11.137
I mean...

19:11.241 --> 19:13.344
what, are they gonna
react the same way?

19:13.448 --> 19:16.034
[equipment rattling]Ah.

19:16.137 --> 19:17.689
[sighs] End of the line.

19:17.793 --> 19:20.172
DC Leone, we've come to
the end of our supply line.

19:20.275 --> 19:21.689
What do we do?

19:21.793 --> 19:25.862
If you detach, I lose all
physical contact with you.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.551
I wish we had the mine
rescue cameras

19:27.655 --> 19:29.206
so I could at least
see what you see.

19:29.310 --> 19:30.724
Should we turn around?

19:30.827 --> 19:32.068
I guess, yeah.KID [in distance]: Help us!

19:32.172 --> 19:34.034
Wait.

19:34.137 --> 19:36.310
Don't you hear that?

19:36.413 --> 19:38.275
KID [in distance]:Help us!

19:39.310 --> 19:41.758
Command, we hear the victims.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.172
We have to keep going.

19:43.275 --> 19:44.758
SHARON:
Okay. If the gas level are safe,

19:44.862 --> 19:47.310
you switch to portables,
have the escape packs ready,

19:47.413 --> 19:48.931
and leave a trail.

19:50.068 --> 19:52.517
Okay, 20.9 and zeroes.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.344
We're good.

19:53.448 --> 19:55.862
And we can, um...

19:55.965 --> 19:57.413
use, uh, medical gloves.

19:57.517 --> 19:59.068
Drop them like a trail
of breadcrumbs.

19:59.172 --> 20:00.862
Perfect.
You stay in contact with me

20:00.965 --> 20:03.034
and listen when I say
if there is any danger,

20:03.137 --> 20:04.172
you turn around.

20:04.275 --> 20:05.827
Copy you.

20:05.931 --> 20:07.379
Breaking down.

20:07.482 --> 20:09.724
Man, I can't believe
Sleeper did that.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.758
Maybe you shouldn't
have punched him.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.482
BODE:
Gab wants me

20:13.586 --> 20:15.827
to stop playing
by prison rules,

20:15.931 --> 20:18.379
start acting like I'm supposed
to be on the outside.

20:18.482 --> 20:19.965
Well, you ain't
on the outside yet.

20:20.068 --> 20:22.965
I know, man, it's like I'm
caught in this in-between.

20:23.068 --> 20:24.896
Wait, uh...

20:26.034 --> 20:27.620
That's it.

20:28.931 --> 20:31.137
We straddle the line.

20:31.241 --> 20:34.551
You know that's
dry snitching, right?

20:34.655 --> 20:36.793
Dangerous to try in here,
but I'll admit, it's smart.

20:38.724 --> 20:40.379
Hey, Cap.

20:40.482 --> 20:42.482
MANNY:
What's up?

20:42.586 --> 20:43.655
How long has it been

20:43.758 --> 20:46.862
since we...
since we all got tested?

20:46.965 --> 20:48.620
What, for drugs?

20:48.724 --> 20:50.965
A while. Why?

20:51.068 --> 20:52.793
Just wondering.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.206
So, the camp's been clean
for a while.

20:56.310 --> 20:57.551
Those tests are expensive,

20:57.655 --> 20:59.517
so unless there's
a reason, then...

21:03.172 --> 21:05.310
Copy.

21:05.413 --> 21:06.655
[clears throat]

21:08.310 --> 21:09.862
Hey, Corey.

21:09.965 --> 21:11.413
Why don't you round up the guys
for a sample collection

21:11.517 --> 21:13.724
once we're back at camp.

21:13.827 --> 21:15.413
Let's go, fellas. On the buggy.

21:15.517 --> 21:17.724
[indistinct chatter]Get that loaded in.

21:20.517 --> 21:22.448
Let's go, come on.All right.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.965
Good.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.931
[Eve grunts]

21:28.034 --> 21:30.448
[panting]

21:31.689 --> 21:33.103
Hey, watch your step
for that beam.

21:33.206 --> 21:34.827
Copy.

21:34.931 --> 21:38.310
All right, now
which way do we go?

21:38.413 --> 21:40.379
Hello?

21:40.482 --> 21:42.137
Hey, can you hear us?

21:42.241 --> 21:43.482
KID [muffled]:
Help us!

21:43.586 --> 21:45.448
I can't tell where
that's coming from.

21:45.551 --> 21:48.206
Okay, let's go right.Gotcha.

21:48.310 --> 21:49.448
KID: We're here!Wait.

21:49.551 --> 21:51.206
Wait, wait, hold on.Hey.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.862
Hey, does that sound like
it's coming from behind us?

21:52.965 --> 21:55.275
Yeah, the sounds
are bouncing everywhere.

21:55.379 --> 21:56.724
Let's just keep going.

21:56.827 --> 21:57.862
Yeah, all right.

21:57.965 --> 21:59.448
Come on.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.068
KID:
Down here!

22:06.172 --> 22:07.482
EVE: There.

22:07.586 --> 22:10.172
Please help my friends.

22:10.275 --> 22:11.413
Okay.

22:11.517 --> 22:12.965
Here we are.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.862
Hey, hi.

22:16.241 --> 22:18.793
Hi, buddy. Let's see
what you got going on, huh?[beeping]

22:18.896 --> 22:20.034
Hey, what is that?

22:20.137 --> 22:22.724
Didi's insulin pump.
She has type 1 diabetes.

22:24.758 --> 22:27.586
Okay, sweetie, can you show me
where your insulin pump is?

22:28.827 --> 22:30.068
She's hypoglycemic.
She needs to eat.

22:30.172 --> 22:32.206
We need to get her out, now.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.758
[beeping]

22:33.862 --> 22:35.482
Dr. Mundy told us.About what?

22:35.586 --> 22:37.655
You've needed a new hip now
for, what, years?

22:37.758 --> 22:39.241
Eh.

22:39.344 --> 22:40.827
One broad's opinion.LUKE: No,

22:40.931 --> 22:42.482
it's three
specialists' opinion.

22:42.586 --> 22:43.793
Dad, just get the surgery.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.068
I don't need it.What are you scared of?

22:46.172 --> 22:48.793
You scared of getting old?
'Cause we're all getting old.

22:48.896 --> 22:51.000
Hey, I'll take care of my life,
you just take care of yours.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.551
And the first thing you can do

22:52.655 --> 22:54.034
is forgive your brother
for making a mistake.

22:54.137 --> 22:56.931
Because when you came crying
to me after Riley died

22:57.034 --> 22:59.482
Stop.and you cheated
on Sharon...

23:02.103 --> 23:03.827
You cheated on Sharon?

23:07.655 --> 23:10.551
Are you kidding me?

23:19.241 --> 23:20.827
Unbelievable, man.

23:27.724 --> 23:31.000
God, you're a miserable
son of a bitch.

23:36.655 --> 23:38.827
Good job, buddy.
All right. I.C., we found

23:38.931 --> 23:40.482
the three Explorers.
One's hypoglycemic,

23:40.586 --> 23:41.655
one with a sprained ankle,

23:41.758 --> 23:43.344
and one alert and walking.

23:43.448 --> 23:45.862
SHARON: Great work, you two.
We have paramedics standing by

23:45.965 --> 23:48.000
and ready.PALOMA:
I wanted to run for help.

23:48.103 --> 23:49.793
Then I started to get lost.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.275
And I didn't want
to leave them behind.

23:51.379 --> 23:54.068
Well, you know what, Paloma?
You made the right call.

23:54.172 --> 23:55.310
EVE:
Ugh.

23:55.413 --> 23:57.758
Dang it. I have no glucose gel.

23:57.862 --> 24:00.000
Uh, Paloma, Jackson,
y'all have any food,

24:00.103 --> 24:01.379
snacks on you?Uh-uh.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.000
We only brought these.

24:03.103 --> 24:05.862
We were supposed
to be home for dinner.

24:05.965 --> 24:08.000
Let's see if there's
anything in there.

24:10.413 --> 24:12.172
Ah! Candy!

24:13.310 --> 24:16.206
This should buy us some time.

24:16.310 --> 24:18.068
Okay, Didi, this should help.

24:18.172 --> 24:20.862
Here you go, my dear.JAKE: Good man.

24:20.965 --> 24:22.482
[rumbling]

24:23.379 --> 24:25.137
[gasps]

24:25.965 --> 24:27.965
SHARON:
Jake, what's going on?

24:28.068 --> 24:28.965
I don't know.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.000
Uh, I'm gonna go check it out.

24:35.344 --> 24:37.275
Smart thinking, Eve.

24:37.379 --> 24:39.793
Um...

24:42.068 --> 24:44.448
No, no, no, no, come on.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.793
Oh, damn it.

24:48.448 --> 24:50.172
Hey, Chief.

24:50.275 --> 24:53.034
So, that, uh, noise we heard
earlier was a cave-in.

24:53.137 --> 24:56.413
[sighs] We can't exit
the way we came in.

24:56.517 --> 24:58.413
We're trapped.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.000
[phone vibrates]

25:04.379 --> 25:06.103
Hey. Everything okay?

25:06.206 --> 25:08.172
Jake and Eve
are trapped in the mine.

25:08.275 --> 25:09.551
What do you mean, trapped?

25:09.655 --> 25:10.827
I need to talk to your father.

25:10.931 --> 25:13.068
I need Walter's
steel-trap memory.

25:13.172 --> 25:15.655
Okay. Let's hope
he's good for something.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.517
Is he giving you a hard time?

25:17.620 --> 25:19.517
That's all he knows how to do.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.310
Ah, did you come to apologize?

25:21.413 --> 25:23.034
No. 42 needs your help.

25:23.137 --> 25:26.931
Walter, we have firefighters
and kids trapped

25:27.034 --> 25:28.379
in the Wolfe mine.GABRIELA: Sir,

25:28.482 --> 25:29.517
do you happen
to know this mine?

25:29.620 --> 25:30.620
I still got coal under

25:30.724 --> 25:31.586
my fingernails from that place.

25:31.689 --> 25:33.310
Just yes, just say yes.

25:33.413 --> 25:34.310
All right, all right.

25:34.413 --> 25:35.896
Eve and Jake went in through

25:36.000 --> 25:38.896
the front entrance,
but all of that is blocked now.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.862
When those youngbloods came
to the first fork in the shaft,

25:41.965 --> 25:43.586
did they go right or left?

25:43.689 --> 25:45.620
Right.WALTER: That's good.

25:45.724 --> 25:47.827
And tell 'em to stay
on that path

25:47.931 --> 25:49.827
and follow it to their left.

25:49.931 --> 25:51.724
And there's an exit
in the back.

25:51.827 --> 25:52.931
SHARON:
I'm not seeing anything on

25:53.034 --> 25:54.586
the map, Walter.
Are you sure?

25:54.689 --> 25:56.241
Yes, I'm sure.

25:56.344 --> 25:58.068
I'm not senile.
It's not on the books

25:58.172 --> 26:00.068
'cause the miners
built it themselves

26:00.172 --> 26:02.310
so they could sneak out
for smoke breaks

26:02.413 --> 26:04.793
without the foreman finding out.

26:05.655 --> 26:07.896
[indistinct chatter]

26:16.862 --> 26:18.448
Hey, I'm worried.

26:18.551 --> 26:20.172
I'm gonna pee dirty, Bode.

26:20.275 --> 26:23.034
Sleeper made me
hold his stash.

26:23.137 --> 26:24.551
I caved.

26:24.655 --> 26:26.344
It's just a setback.

26:26.448 --> 26:27.655
Okay?

26:27.758 --> 26:29.310
Worst-case scenario?

26:29.413 --> 26:30.758
You go, you get treatment.

26:30.862 --> 26:33.172
You'll be back here
at fire camp before you know it.

26:33.275 --> 26:35.931
Listen, man, there-there's
always gonna be other Sleepers.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.344
So you-you choose
the right crowd,

26:38.448 --> 26:41.034
and you stick
to what you know is right.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.068
Sleeper heard C.O.s are gonna
raid the bunks tonight.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.068
Good, hope they find
every last pill.

26:48.172 --> 26:49.310
He hid the stash.

26:49.413 --> 26:51.275
SLEEPER:
Don't say anything
you'll regret.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.344
How's it feel?

27:01.448 --> 27:04.379
Sending an innocent kid
like Troy back to the pen?

27:04.482 --> 27:06.448
It's not a done deal yet.

27:06.551 --> 27:09.482
Oh.You know, Troy's
really proven himself here.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.551
I'm not sure that
your track record

27:12.655 --> 27:14.482
can, uh, can beat
a dirty test though.

27:14.586 --> 27:16.034
I'm cleaner than water.

27:16.137 --> 27:18.034
Well, they'll find your stash.

27:20.034 --> 27:22.241
You made your bed, Leone.

27:29.241 --> 27:31.172
EVE:
Keep going left, Paloma.

27:33.896 --> 27:35.758
And watch out

27:35.862 --> 27:37.793
for the dynamite up there.

27:37.896 --> 27:39.793
[grunts]
Watch your step.

27:45.482 --> 27:48.241
All right, how you doing, buddy?EVE: You good back there?

27:48.344 --> 27:50.344
Yeah, we're good.

27:53.137 --> 27:56.620
Should be coming up.Yeah, should be right up here.

27:56.724 --> 27:59.137
Right here, right?

27:59.241 --> 28:01.655
Wait a minute.

28:01.758 --> 28:05.275
What? Papa Leone said it was...

28:07.310 --> 28:09.310
Maybe it's...It's sealed shut.

28:09.413 --> 28:11.310
Uh...

28:11.413 --> 28:13.689
it means we're gonna find
another way out, okay?

28:17.413 --> 28:19.103
Okay. DC Leone.

28:19.206 --> 28:21.689
The back exit has been
sealed with concrete.

28:21.793 --> 28:25.172
SHARON:
Copy that. Sending
a sledgehammer team ASAP.

28:25.275 --> 28:27.103
I don't think
we have that kind of time.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.758
Didi's lost consciousness.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.965
Didi! Didi!

28:39.275 --> 28:40.896
EVE:
Come on, Didi, you got to
wake up, sweetie, come on.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.758
No, no, no, no, no.PALOMA: What's going on?

28:42.862 --> 28:44.310
Paloma, go over
by Jackson.

28:44.413 --> 28:45.689
Jake, she's seizing.

28:45.793 --> 28:47.758
Chief, we can't wait anymore.
She started to seize.

28:47.862 --> 28:49.551
Permission
to detonate our way out.

28:49.655 --> 28:51.862
Wait, what are you saying?I can use the dynamite

28:51.965 --> 28:53.413
that we found
to blow our way out.

28:53.517 --> 28:54.862
No. Absolutely not.

28:54.965 --> 28:56.310
You could cause another collapse

28:56.413 --> 28:57.896
and then you can
injure yourselves.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.862
No, no, there was
a cart that we passed.

28:59.965 --> 29:02.379
We can use that as a shield,
but we have to go now.

29:02.482 --> 29:05.482
Chief, if this seizure
lasts much longer,

29:05.586 --> 29:08.275
we're talking
brain damage or death.

29:08.379 --> 29:11.275
Chief, look, I worked
avalanche control

29:11.379 --> 29:13.931
at a ski resort.
I know my way around explosives.

29:14.034 --> 29:15.827
But you got to trust me on this.

29:15.931 --> 29:17.448
Please.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.413
I do trust you.

29:20.517 --> 29:21.965
