[Saanvi] <i>Previously on</i> Manifest.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.690
She's got the sapphire.
What chance does the Lifeboat have?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.775
You were tasked to figure out a cure.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.236
I think I did it. The DNA has no anomaly.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.989
[Ben] You're holding on to your grief
so tight, it's taken a toll.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.366
You are unique, even among 828ers.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.411
I cannot lose another family member
to that godforsaken place.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.996
Ow! You chipped me, didn't you?

00:37.996 --> 00:40.749
We have a plan to find
the 13 fugitive passengers.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.916
I'm part of the safe house.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.501
- They're all together?
- Nine are.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.379
You don't understand.
My anxiety, it's too much.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.965
My duty ended
when I stepped off that plane.

00:48.965 --> 00:52.719
There were only two people who saw
what was coming. You and Captain Daly.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.180
Both of these plagues
originated with Daly.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.974
Judgment only comes
after the two witnesses die.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.685
It is my duty to bring on the end of times

01:00.685 --> 01:02.687
by killing the two witnesses.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.402
[mysterious music plays]

01:11.279 --> 01:12.864
[woman] <i>It has been just over six hours</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:15.283
<i>since the river
outside the 828 Detention Center</i>

01:15.283 --> 01:16.659
<i>turned blood red.</i>

01:16.659 --> 01:19.996
<i>Scientists are still struggling
to confirm the cause.</i>

01:19.996 --> 01:21.998
No one can say for sure why or how

01:21.998 --> 01:25.210
this mysterious
and, frankly, terrifying sight came to be.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.755
But given the spate of outbreaks
plaguing this 828 facility

01:28.755 --> 01:30.507
and its proximity to the river,

01:30.507 --> 01:33.676
is it crazy to think
this is the fault of 828ers?

01:33.676 --> 01:36.137
After all, weren't these people
responsible for the fissures

01:36.137 --> 01:38.890
that killed
nearly 1,000 innocent civilians?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.351
<i>Aren't some of them still roaming free?</i>

01:41.351 --> 01:44.604
<i>How much longer is our government
gonna pretend this isn't happening--</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:48.191
The safe house doesn't feel safe anymore.
I don't like this.

01:48.858 --> 01:49.692
We should leave.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.528
Amuta said we should stay.

01:51.528 --> 01:56.116
Captain Amuta also should've been back
hours ago. Maybe something happened.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.033
[door opens]

02:02.997 --> 02:04.624
Georgia wasn't at the drop.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.543
She left a note.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.795
So what should we do?

02:09.504 --> 02:11.297
For now? Nothing.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.883
No more supply runs. No more Callings.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.470
This city's a powder keg.
We need to hunker down till this is over.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.680
[man] Until we're caught?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.141
We'll end up like the others
in the detention center.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.435
I am telling you, staying is a bad idea.

02:25.895 --> 02:26.729
Breathe.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.691
I got you.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.110
We're really gonna wait here
like sitting ducks?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.571
- What if you were followed? What if--
- [Amuta] I wasn't.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.950
Look, moving as a large group isn't ideal.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.870
For now, this...

02:42.996 --> 02:44.497
this is our best bet.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.333
We're safe here.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.252
[Ben] <i>None of us are safe here.</i>

02:49.252 --> 02:51.462
I know you think
you have Angelina locked up,

02:51.462 --> 02:53.006
but she can still endanger the world.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.633
She's a threat!
And she needs to be dealt with.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.594
And what am I supposed to do?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.221
Say I believed you
that Angelina has these powers.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.639
How do I handle her?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.267
Use Saanvi's serum.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.020
Saanvi created that
to eliminate Daly's plagues.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.106
Right. But it was based
on pre-existing research.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.442
What exactly are you telling me?

03:14.068 --> 03:18.281
Years ago, Saanvi created an antidote
that eliminated her Callings.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.659
If it worked on real ones,
it just might work on fake ones too.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.078
You have to at least try it.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.831
Angelina's locked up
24 hours a day in isolation.

03:26.831 --> 03:27.999
She's dangerous.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.418
As far as I'm concerned,
you're all dangerous.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.421
And that crowd growing out there
doesn't disagree.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.799
- They think you poisoned the East River.
- We had nothing to do with the river.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.093
You wanna go out there
and swear to that? I can't--

03:39.093 --> 03:40.720
You kept us all locked up.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.804
Not all.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.474
Too many passengers
are still on the loose,

03:44.474 --> 03:47.227
and one of them might've caused
a plague just like Daly did.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.230
Angelina's in custody now.
She's not my concern.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.775
I have bigger problems on my plate.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.446
- [indistinct chatter]
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.614
Pardon me.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.450
Hey. Hey, no deliveries today, Pops.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.328
I'm here to see my daughter.
Can you check the list?

04:07.288 --> 04:08.790
Steven Stone is the name.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
- [man] What he say?
- [man 2] Stone.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.294
- [man 3] Yeah?
- [man] That's him?

04:13.294 --> 04:15.755
All right. Get back. Get back. Get back.
Get back. Get back.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.800
[mysterious music plays]

04:20.009 --> 04:21.803
[door beeps, buzzes]

04:26.516 --> 04:29.560
Ben Stone corroborated
everything you said about your abilities.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.855
So when can I expect passengers
to start showing up?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.858
I can't force Amuta to turn himself in.

04:35.858 --> 04:39.362
I can only use the people
he holds most dear to suggest it.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.947
[Zimmer] People see you as a threat.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.408
They'd be more than happy for me
to get rid of your powers,

04:43.408 --> 04:44.534
lock you up forever.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.036
No. We have a deal.

04:47.036 --> 04:51.749
We do. I stuck my neck out for you,
but that means you need to deliver.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.668
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

04:55.044 --> 04:58.423
I have everyone, from my city councilmen
to the White House Chief of Staff,

04:58.423 --> 05:01.217
telling me I need
to get the situation under control.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.930
So if those 12 passengers at large
don't show up within the day,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.224
you're never getting out of here.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.517
[door buzzes]

05:13.146 --> 05:14.272
[door locks]

05:23.865 --> 05:24.699
[door buzzes]

05:30.830 --> 05:32.290
- [Michaela] Dad.
- [chuckles]

05:35.126 --> 05:36.878
- Dad, you okay?
- [Steven sighs]

05:36.878 --> 05:38.379
Good to see you too, kiddo.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.757
- Sorry, you look really--
- [Steven] Exhausted?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.677
Yeah. I hate to break it to you,
but it's a bit of a madhouse outside.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.097
I haven't been in a crowd that big
since Woodstock.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.641
[chuckles] Yeah, honestly,
I think it might be safer in here.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.352
[Steven] You might be right.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.729
I got to work this morning
and found it was closed.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.775
They're gonna keep everything shuttered
until everything gets a bit calmer.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.942
How about, um,

06:01.361 --> 06:02.653
Gabriel or Olive?

06:02.653 --> 06:05.448
I... I dropped them at Port Authority
this morning.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.867
They're gonna stay with a friend up in...

06:08.701 --> 06:09.535
Smart thinking.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.497
Yeah. Well... [grunts]

06:12.497 --> 06:14.082
I have my moments.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.921
Looks like I have my senior moments too.
I left my shoe untied.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.224
What are you thinking?
This is really dangerous.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.517
[Steven] It's important.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.561
Olive thinks
she's on to something that could help.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.397
Something that TJ can help complete.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.648
Did you read it?

06:38.648 --> 06:39.941
You know how I am.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.819
All that mythology stuff,
it's above my pay grade.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.406
But Olive sure takes after her grandmother
in that respect.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.700
- Once she gets her teeth into something--
- Oh yeah, there's no letting go.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.787
Remember when Mom decided
she wanted to bird-watch?

06:52.787 --> 06:56.124
[chuckles] We must have hit
every nature reserve in the state.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.959
[sighs]

07:00.086 --> 07:01.087
I miss her.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.088
Yeah.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.843
She would've loved your husband.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.262
It's okay to talk about it.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.224
Yeah, I think I finally can.

07:13.975 --> 07:19.313
She wanted you to know
that you're worthy of happiness, Michaela.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.648
Especially now.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.526
Everything that's happened to you...

07:24.569 --> 07:27.196
to all of you, it's just so unfair.

[officer] Keep them hands up!
Get on the ground! On the ground!

07:48.926 --> 07:51.429
We're safe and sound, locked up in here.
Who's taking care of you?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.556
Oh... [grunts]

07:53.556 --> 07:55.016

08:35.515 --> 08:37.183
[Ben] Mick? What's going on?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.267
Jordan said it--

08:40.811 --> 08:42.647
What is it? You have a Calling?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.191
What's wrong?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.527
Ben, it was awful.
He just... He just collapsed.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.070
Dad?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.949
Oh my God. Is he okay?

08:53.658 --> 08:54.742
I don't think so.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.788
Just-- I just had to stand there
while the EMTs worked on him.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.081
I couldn't even do anything.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.042
- All right. It's gonna be all right.
- [Michaela] You don't know that, Ben.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.629
No one is telling me where he is
or what is going on. I just--

09:08.089 --> 09:10.258
I can't stay here. I have to do something.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.634
Leave the D.C.?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.554
I wasn't there for Mom when she died.
I wasn't there for Zeke either.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.015
Ben, I'm not gonna just sit here.
I have to find a way to be with Dad.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.480
Use your Calling. The one you just had.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.109
- It's of a stream somewhere--
- [Ben] Says who?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.111
Zimmer's not gonna know
what your Calling was.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.947
She's only gonna know you had one,
so use it.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.409
To get out. Yeah.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.494
Thank you.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.745
Just find Dad.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.956
Do what you can for him.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.166
I will.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.419
Guard!

09:51.007 --> 09:52.008
[Eagan] Guard.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.595
I think someone forgot
to call our group to lunch.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.679
If it's pizza again,

09:56.679 --> 09:59.348
can you let the chef know
I'm cardboard-intolerant?

10:16.240 --> 10:17.950
[TJ] Angelina's in the D.C.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.287
Using the power of the Omega Sapphire,

10:22.580 --> 10:23.748
she killed them.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.836
What? You on hunger strike
in here, Gandhi?

10:29.545 --> 10:33.174
We got our water back.
Here, drink up. Oh shit. I'm so sorry.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.593
- I hope this wasn't important.
- Back off. I got it.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.139
Sure. I don't need the note anyway.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.725
I already got what I need to know.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.019
It's been a minute
since Angelina knocked me out

10:45.019 --> 10:46.437
and stole my sapphire.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.523
But now that she's here,
it's time for some payback.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.693
You'll never find her. You can't just go
waltzing around the D.C.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.655
I get by with a little help
from your friends.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.201
Clean up on aisle seven!
And don't you try to stop me.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.285
I'm coming with you.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.079
[mysterious music plays]

11:08.376 --> 11:12.546
I know he's here. Take me to him.
I want to see Captain Bill Daly.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.882
You're in no position to make demands.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.968
You disobeyed a government order
to turn yourself in.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.304
So lock me up. Throw away the key.

11:20.971 --> 11:21.931
But know this.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.766
If you don't let me see my friend,

11:23.766 --> 11:25.476
you don't get to know
where the others are!

11:26.352 --> 11:29.522
How much longer do you think
your friends can survive on their own?

11:30.231 --> 11:33.901
We have food, shelter,
teams that follow the Callings.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.530
They'll be safe here. Help me help them.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.742
I want to see Bill Daly.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.163
What about my phone call?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.958
I'm a citizen. I have rights!

11:49.875 --> 11:52.169
[Jared] Director, we have a passenger
with a Calling.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.004
Requesting permission to solve it.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.882
The last thing I need
is another passenger outside.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.259
It's too dangerous.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.012
Look. There's a reason you chose
Michaela Stone out of everyone here.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.474
She's an ex-cop and a damn good one.
She can handle herself.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.185
- Who had the Calling?
- I did.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.523
How convenient. You want to go out
and solve your own Calling?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.692
Want to? No. Need to? Yes.

12:14.692 --> 12:18.529
I think it's related to the blood river,
and I think people's lives are at stake.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.073
Your father's?
I heard what happened this morning.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.743
If you think she's faking her Calling,
it's impossible.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.911
We have three ways
of verifying it, starting--

12:25.911 --> 12:28.038
You were with them?
I assume you can confirm.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.124
Saanvi's not wrong.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.918
Maybe you could fool a heart rate monitor
or blood pressure result,

12:32.918 --> 12:35.254
but look at these fMRI scans.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.173
You can't fake neural activity.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.925
Thank you both. You can go.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.976
I can't afford a misstep,

12:48.976 --> 12:52.229
which is why now, more than ever,
it's important to follow protocol.

12:55.065 --> 12:58.569
She steps one inch out of line,
and you'll be paying the price.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.988
Think you can manage that, Vasquez?

13:00.988 --> 13:02.990
I'll stake my career on it, ma'am.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.244
Back by 5:00

13:07.828 --> 13:08.996
at the latest.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.792
[sighs] 5:00 does not give us much time.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.461
Can you text Drea and tell her
to meet us at Park and Garvey

13:15.461 --> 13:16.837
and that I need alcohol?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.638
I don't get it.
You escaped capture for months.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.473
How did the government find you now?

13:28.057 --> 13:31.310
You misunderstood.
I wasn't arrested. I turned myself in.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.981
I'm waiting for someone here,
but that woman, Zimmer,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.233
she won't let me see him.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.234
Wait.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.778
Who are you meeting?

13:41.946 --> 13:44.532
Captain Daly.
He came to the safe house this morning.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.912
Amuta, I don't know how to tell you this,

13:49.912 --> 13:52.164
but Bill died yesterday.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.291
What? But that's impossible.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.253
He begged me to meet him here.
He's on his way.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.171
This is what I warned Zimmer about.

13:59.171 --> 14:04.260
Amuta, there's a passenger, Angelina.
She has this power.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.763
She can make you believe
that you see something,

14:07.763 --> 14:09.223
someone who isn't there.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.851
- [Amuta] That's not-- I'm telling you--
- No, it's what she does.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.437
Angelina, she twists people,
getting them to do things they'd never do,

14:15.437 --> 14:17.398
evil things
that could sink the Lifeboat forever.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.526
No person could have such a power.
How do you know?

14:21.819 --> 14:23.821
Because I fell for the same trick.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.575
Angelina killed my wife.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.414
And then she made me think
I could see her, touch her.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.792
Grace was right there.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.507
But then she told me to do something
that I would never do.

14:44.675 --> 14:45.885
Give up my daughter.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.221
And now she's made you think
that Daly wants you to do something

14:49.221 --> 14:51.265
that you would never do, turn yourself in.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.604
So you're telling me
not only did I lose my friend...

14:57.897 --> 15:01.275
My God, those people I left
at the safe house to fend for themselves.

15:03.444 --> 15:08.407
But why? Why would Angelina want
to lure me here? What does she gain?

15:08.407 --> 15:12.036
Because Zimmer is desperate
to get every last passenger in the D.C.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.997
But everything she's done
up to this point has failed, which--

15:16.832 --> 15:17.833
Oh my God.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.588
What if she bribed Angelina
to use her sapphire

15:22.588 --> 15:25.049
to convince the others
to turn themselves in?

15:26.216 --> 15:28.177
[suspenseful music swells]

15:28.177 --> 15:29.219
[door opens]

15:30.638 --> 15:32.598
- [Angelina] Am I free to go?
- Not quite.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.976
But the copilot turned himself in.
We had a deal.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.728
The deal was for all passengers.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.148
Unfortunately, Amuta won't give up
the location of the safe house.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.775
I need the location now.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.485
I don't know where that is.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.862
So get in their heads and figure it out.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.741
Find me that location,
or you'll be stuck here for good.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.576
Uh...

15:53.619 --> 15:56.538
Okay, I saw some clues
when I projected into Amuta's mind.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.999
Uh, a TV.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.920
Some numbers on the door, 408, I think.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.297
408 what? I need an exact address.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.927
[sighs]

16:17.142 --> 16:19.103
Okay, I see a window.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.439
A street outside.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.775
A sign. A street sign.

16:24.775 --> 16:25.985
What's the intersection?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.237
Fourth and...

16:28.237 --> 16:30.489
What? Fourth and what?

16:33.409 --> 16:35.244
[rumbling]

16:40.457 --> 16:42.418
- Did you feel that?
- You're so close.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.628
Don't worry about it.
It was just a tremor.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.134
That's Angelina.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.802
She can control the earth too?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.304
In the past, misusing sapphire
has triggered quakes.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.473
The safe house. This can't happen.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.267
I won't let them make
the same mistake I did.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.351
What choice do we have?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.854
I need to get the code word
so they know they're in danger,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.564
but the guards took my cell phone.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.774
- Do you trust me?
- [Amuta] Mm-hmm.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.276
Good.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.612
Guard! I need to see Zimmer.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.822
- What are you doing?
- Sh, sh.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.492
What's the code word? The code word?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.661
- Chicken coop. Why?
- [Ben] Chicken coop.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.541
Because we might be able to get
to those passengers before Angelina.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.667
[door buzzes]

17:23.667 --> 17:25.753
[suspenseful music plays]

17:36.263 --> 17:39.099
Park and Garvey.
Just like your Calling said.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.227
All right. So, what's next?

17:42.728 --> 17:43.812
We wait for Drea.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.522
We wait?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
When have you ever wanted to wait
for anything?

17:50.861 --> 17:52.696
You faked it, didn't you?

17:52.696 --> 17:53.989
I didn't fake it.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.199
I did. I had a Calling,

17:55.199 --> 17:59.328
but it was just of some babbling brook,
and I figured it wasn't urgent,

17:59.328 --> 18:02.081
so I thought
we could make a quick field trip.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.666
Not bad, Stone. So what's next?

18:04.666 --> 18:06.460
It's better if you don't know.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.421
A little too late for that.
How'd you know where your dad was?

18:10.964 --> 18:12.341
Old habits.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.135
I mean, it's the closest hospital
to the D.C. that's not on diversion,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.221
and I just figured
the bus would take him there.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.184
Hey. It's a little early
for my signature Mikami martini,

18:22.184 --> 18:24.061
but it's my day off.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.522
What are you guys celebrating?

18:27.272 --> 18:31.068
I see you got Jared's text.
Not quite what I meant, but it'll do.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.028
Do what?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.280
It'll work as a...

18:37.116 --> 18:38.033
disinfectant.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.911
I need you to take out my tracker.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.663
And, Drea, I know it's your day off,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.665
but I might need you
to drive around with it.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.168
- Happy to throw 'em off your trail.
- Uh... [clears throat]

18:48.168 --> 18:51.880
What? You mean, you want me to, like...
you want me to <i>cut</i> cut?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.092
I don't know what I was thinking.
Drea, are you down?

18:55.092 --> 18:56.009
Yeah. Yeah.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.887
[mysterious music plays]

19:08.730 --> 19:09.815
Yeah, right there.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.900
[Michaela hisses in pain]

19:11.900 --> 19:13.402
- [Michaela] Ah!
- [Drea] Sorry.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.445
Ay! [exhales]

19:18.365 --> 19:19.449
Okay. I got it. I got it.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.410
Here.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.621
All right.

19:24.621 --> 19:29.042
So, with a few hours of freedom, where to?

19:29.042 --> 19:31.253
I should probably get a Band-Aid first.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.214
Yeah, we just so happen to be
on the same block as a hospital.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.966
Yeah, what are the odds, indeed?

19:43.682 --> 19:47.102
Okay, so wherever Angelina is,
she's not in any of the living quarters.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.523
Sure you haven't seen anyone matching
the description of Muppet for Jesus?

19:51.523 --> 19:54.985
I told you there's a new guy in group A,
but that's all I've seen.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.868
You're up, Houdini. Let's see you
work your magic on that door.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.370
Hey, you know I'm on your side,
but there are limits.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.331
All you have to do is swipe your key card.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.415
Come on, man.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.791
I could get fired.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.753
And that will mean
I can't see Polly or the baby--

20:12.753 --> 20:14.796
We won't let that happen.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.384
- Look, why don't we call it quits?
- Oh, and leave you to the sapphire?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.137
I told you I don't care about
the sapphire. I care about--

20:22.137 --> 20:23.513
Yeah, yeah, the end of the world.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.433
God, you ever get tired
of playing the hero?

20:26.934 --> 20:30.687
Listen, if we do find the sapphire,
it could help Polly. And the baby.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
Just a scouting mission?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.069
Swear on my honor.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.453
- Why are you doing this?
- You asked me to.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.081
I was born at night, but not last night.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.625
So why do you really want
to talk to the press?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.628
You wanna know why? Because I'm tired.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.631
I'm tired of the world thinking
the passengers pose a threat.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.299
- If I go, maybe they'll see--
- See what?

20:59.299 --> 21:02.219
That we're no different than them.
That we're human.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.306
Then maybe
all this anti-828 shit will stop.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.225
You think that'll actually work?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.394
Do you have a better idea?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.273
After those tremors, I'll try anything
to get the press off my back.

21:14.273 --> 21:19.194
But, Ben, I catch wind of anything
even slightly suspicious...

21:19.194 --> 21:21.571
[indistinct chatter]

21:22.281 --> 21:23.323
Yeah.

21:30.122 --> 21:30.998
[man] Whoa! Hey!

21:31.999 --> 21:33.041
[man 2] Check it out!

21:33.041 --> 21:34.876
[man 3] An 828er's here.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.130
[woman] We deserve answers. Now!

21:38.130 --> 21:39.298
Hello.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.218
My name is Ben Stone.
I was a passenger on Flight 828.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.636
- Why is the river red?
- [clamoring]

21:45.429 --> 21:46.722
All right.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.475
I'm not here to answer your questions
about the river or the tremors.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.768
I know as much as you do.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.353
So why are you here?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.105
[man 4] We gotta know something.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.440
[man 5] Right. Right.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.609
I'm here before you today,
not as a passenger,

22:01.486 --> 22:02.321
but a person.

22:02.321 --> 22:06.491
A father, a brother, a son,

22:07.117 --> 22:08.535
a human who wants

22:09.870 --> 22:12.789
what every human on this planet wants,
to be free.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.959
Free to have a life of our own choosing.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.421
But you've caged us in this...

22:21.214 --> 22:23.425
this chicken coop for no reason.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.344
[woman 2] No reason?

22:25.344 --> 22:29.097
I don't know why the river turned red,
but I know it wasn't our fault.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.767
- [man 6] We don't know that.
- [man 7] Yeah.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.435
So I'm asking you, please.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.604
I'm begging you,

22:36.146 --> 22:40.108
let us fly this chicken coop
and return home to our friends,

22:40.108 --> 22:42.486
our loved ones, our families.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.655
Return to our mission,
not to divide the world,

22:46.281 --> 22:47.115
but to heal it.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.909
[man 8] Heal on this, freak!

22:48.909 --> 22:50.494
[clamoring]

22:54.498 --> 22:56.208
[high-pitched ringing]

23:00.629 --> 23:04.174
[woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

23:05.425 --> 23:06.426
[man] Ms. Stone?

23:09.096 --> 23:10.680
Um, how bad is it?

23:11.348 --> 23:13.350
Good news is your father survived.

23:14.142 --> 23:17.896
The bad news? I mean--
Can I see him? Can I talk to him?

23:17.896 --> 23:20.107
Your father suffered a massive stroke.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.360
The lack of oxygen to his brain
created numerous complications,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.237
including his ability to talk.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.614
- I thought you said he was okay.
- I said he survived.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.117
This is the start of a very long journey.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.744
Your father will need
round-the-clock care,

23:32.744 --> 23:34.496
space for his physical therapy.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.498
Recovery isn't impossible,

23:36.498 --> 23:39.918
but it will require both financial
and personal sacrifice.

23:41.378 --> 23:45.465
I'm sure you were hoping for better news,
so I'll give you some space.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.222
[Michaela] Full-time care, space.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.641
What am I supposed to-- I'm a prisoner.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.143
[Jared] But you're not alone. Okay?

23:56.143 --> 24:00.564
Tell me what I can do.
Seriously, anything. Where can I take him?

24:00.564 --> 24:03.442
I don't think it matters
where you take him. I can't see him.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.614
I'm not gonna abandon him. I just won't.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.499
Police! On the ground now!

24:19.499 --> 24:20.876

24:21.376 --> 24:23.336
- [man 2] Hallway is clear!
- [man 3] Clear! Right!

24:24.045 --> 24:25.714
- [man 2] Hallway is clear!
- [man 3] Clear!

24:25.714 --> 24:26.798
[man 4] Bedroom is clear.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.967
[man 5] Target location
has been evacuated.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.928
[Zimmer] The safe house was empty.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.765
Almost as if someone
warned the passengers.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.769
You think I tipped them off?

24:39.769 --> 24:41.938
Why would I do that? I wanna leave.

24:41.938 --> 24:46.109
There was hot coffee on the counter.
The TV was still on. Someone warned them.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.069
Well, I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.404
How can I be sure?

24:52.574 --> 24:55.827
You would've never found that address
without me.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.248
I've done my part.
Now it's time for you to do yours.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.250
Or what?

25:05.545 --> 25:09.132
I hold the power of the sapphire
in the palm of my hand.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.302
You've seen what it can do
when I'm working with you.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.639
You don't wanna see what I can do
when I'm working against you.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.183
You're right.

25:19.518 --> 25:25.106
What I'd like to see is what I could do
with the sapphire in the palm of my hand.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.320
- [Ben grunts]
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Did that hurt?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.239
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.617
Of course I worry about you.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.577
You shouldn't. I'm fine.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.164
You took such a beating out there.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.379
It's the passengers
you need to worry about.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.842
Saanvi, Angelina...
the Lifeboat, she's sinking it,

25:52.842 --> 25:56.263
and... I don't know how to stop her.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.057
<i>We</i> are doing everything we can
to counterbalance her.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.226
How? She killed Fiona and Daly.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.603
And whatever message
they were meant to bring, it's gone.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.023
Then she manipulates Amuta,
earthquakes start,

26:07.023 --> 26:08.942
and she puts the safe house in jeopardy.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.277
- [door opens]
- [Zimmer] Dr. Bahl.

26:11.903 --> 26:12.946
Drop everything.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.991
I want you to remove the Omega Sapphire.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.369
No, you can't! God gave me this sapphire.
He needs me to use it.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.413
Who authorized this?

26:23.331 --> 26:25.041
- Orson, sedate the patient.
- [Angelina] No!

26:27.168 --> 26:29.170
[panting slows]

26:29.963 --> 26:31.631
[suspenseful music plays]

26:38.013 --> 26:41.391
We have no idea
what the medical consequences would be

26:41.391 --> 26:42.809
for extracting the sapphire.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.520
You've seen the mayhem
Angelina's already created.

26:46.229 --> 26:49.691
As long as she has that fragment,
we can't control what she does next.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.235
What are you planning on doing with it?

26:52.235 --> 26:56.156
The sapphire. Once we extract it,
what are you planning on doing with it?

26:56.156 --> 26:59.701
People above my pay grade
will make that determination.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.163
Okay, so this has nothing to do
with using the Omega Sapphire

27:03.163 --> 27:04.414
to weaponize Callings?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.416
- Because when the Major--
- Let's remove it.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.627
Then we'll figure out what to do with it.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.883
Dr. Bahl, you can be part
of this procedure,

27:14.883 --> 27:16.635
or you can stand aside.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.473
[man] Ready?

27:24.934 --> 27:26.936
[mysterious music plays]

27:31.983 --> 27:34.152
The sapphire. It's moving.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.236
Where'd it go?

27:35.236 --> 27:37.280
- [Zimmer] What do you mean?
- It's gone.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.783
Then cut her open and get it out.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.037
No. I don't think
you were meant to have it.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.831
It's resorbed into her body.
It's dissolved into her veins.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.291
Extracting it now would kill her.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.092
I need to make some calls,
inform everybody of the hiccup.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.928
Bring her to me
the minute she's conscious.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.572
[Jared] Okay. So what now?

28:19.572 --> 28:22.325
Full-time care place near me or Beverly's?

28:22.325 --> 28:25.745
I feel bad putting him in full-time care
when he's got me.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.165
You're a prisoner. You said so yourself.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.378
Even if Drea's scavenger hunt works
and somehow you're allowed out...

28:39.259 --> 28:40.468
Another Calling?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.597
It's the same stream,
and I didn't recognize it before,

28:44.597 --> 28:46.766
but I think it's by Tarik's house.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.145
I think the Calling's telling me
where to go.

28:50.145 --> 28:54.482
Go? Michaela, you...
But you've gotta be back in...

28:54.482 --> 28:58.236
Jared, the Calling's giving me
another chance to be with my dad.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.946
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna pass that up.

29:05.118 --> 29:05.994
Okay.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.288
If this is what you want.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.000
- I'm in.
- What?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.253
- Where are we headed next?
- [Michaela] No, no.

29:16.796 --> 29:19.382
You would be
aiding and abetting a fugitive.

29:19.382 --> 29:21.509
You would be a fugitive.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.553
I'm not asking you
to blow up your life like that.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.431
I know you're not asking.
I'm volunteering.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.143
Maybe this is our chance.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.896
You and I would be together
if it wasn't for that plane disappearing

29:32.896 --> 29:34.731
and robbing us of that opportunity.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.234
I'm not letting that shit happen again.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.238
Are you sure?

29:44.532 --> 29:47.035
You don't...
You don't need to make this decision.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.120
I've always been sure.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.332
The difference is this time, where you go,

29:53.833 --> 29:54.667
I go.

[sentimental music plays]

[Drea clears throat]

30:20.443 --> 30:21.903
Sorry, that's awkward.

30:21.903 --> 30:25.281
No, no. Whole point of no strings
is that it's never awkward.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.866
Yeah, and, uh...

30:28.284 --> 30:33.748
I mean, we all here know that this...
this hasn't been a thing for a while.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.041
Oh yeah. No, this--

30:35.041 --> 30:38.962
I mean, it was never really even a thing.
It was like a no-thing. It was--

30:39.671 --> 30:42.340
Um, though, I am wondering what to do with

30:42.340 --> 30:45.718
the world's first-ever
80-proof tracking device

30:45.718 --> 30:49.013
since I don't think you're going back.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.349
Tell Ben I love him,

30:51.349 --> 30:54.185
and I'm sorry to make him
captain the Lifeboat on his own,

30:54.185 --> 30:57.313
but the Calling wants me
to be with my dad.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.566
He'll get it.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.317
You know the passengers have me too.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.534
We gotta go. I'll drive.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.080
Oh shit, sorry.
Um, you texted. Was there...

31:14.080 --> 31:17.208
Oh, yeah, I don't even...
I don't even remember what that was about.

Hey, Detective. Stay safe out there.

You too.

- Hey, do we have any hydrogen peroxide?
- Uh...

Can you get some from supply, please?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.418
Hey, did you hear?
Wait, where are you going?

32:02.587 --> 32:04.547
Um, that's the Calling antidote.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.008
We don't have time.
I can inject this into her IV port, right?

32:07.008 --> 32:09.552
Ben, stop.

32:09.552 --> 32:10.470
We have to.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.389
If we can't remove the sapphire,
then we have to stop her from using it.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.100
No, we can't just do that.
We have to run tests.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.021
Saanvi, as long as Angelina has the power
to project false Callings,

32:20.021 --> 32:21.314
none of us are safe.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.776
If we don't take this opportunity,
if we do nothing,

32:24.776 --> 32:27.362
then we put the whole of humanity at risk.

She's killing us.

32:30.698 --> 32:34.911
This is also killing. I nearly died
when I injected myself with the antidote.

you're gonna be powerless to hurt anyone.

Stop, Ben, please. The Callings,
my powers, they're all I have left.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.100
Right. Maybe we should have just stayed--

- [cocks gun]
- Don't shoot!

39:55.518 --> 39:57.686
We're passengers, just like you. 24D.

[TJ] It's TJ.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.510
TJ, are you okay?

40:29.510 --> 40:32.304
No. And if Olive is right, none of us are.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.849
The World card shows a red river.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.977
She snuck this in to me this morning.
It has to be connected.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.399
Wait. I tested the river water.
I should have results by now.

40:48.654 --> 40:52.241
Oh my God. Peyssonnelia.
That much? That fast?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.742
What's happening? Fill me in.

40:53.742 --> 40:58.873
Daly's blood isn't what caused the river
to change color. It's red algae.

40:58.873 --> 41:03.210
But the only thing that can cause
that much algae that quickly is if...

41:05.045 --> 41:08.340
there's a hydrothermic vent
in the earth's crust.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.968
As if a volcano is erupting below us?

41:10.968 --> 41:13.596
Dr. Bahl, you need to come with me.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.347
[Saanvi] No, I have work to do--

41:15.347 --> 41:17.266
Not anymore. You've been transferred.

41:17.266 --> 41:21.187
Transferred where--
Don't touch me. Transferred where?

41:21.187 --> 41:24.106
- I'm afraid that's classified.
- What? You can't just take her.

41:24.106 --> 41:27.109
You're not even supposed to be here,
Mr. Stone.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.987
Unless you want to end up
in solitary, stand down.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.364
- Hey!
- Don't. Ben!

41:32.364 --> 41:33.824
- Hey!
- [Saanvi] Ben! Ben!

41:33.824 --> 41:37.703
Saanvi, I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna talk
to Vance. It's gonna be fine!

41:37.703 --> 41:40.331
- Saanvi, it's gonna be okay!

41:41.957 --> 41:43.334

- What was that?

41:45.586 --> 41:46.795
They're ahead of us.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.924
Saanvi's not the only scientist
to figure out there's a volcano

41:49.924 --> 41:50.925
underneath New York.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.344
She might be the only one
who knows what that means.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.054

The red river, it leads to a volcano.

42:02.394 --> 42:04.146
It's been trying to warn us.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.399
The world's ending.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.445
And we know how.
