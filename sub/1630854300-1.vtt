WEBVTT

00:28.666 --> 00:29.916
Come on! Sing with us.

00:30.541 --> 00:33.250
Sorry, Dad, but a family sing-along

00:33.333 --> 00:35.958
isn't gonna make me
feel better about moving.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.333
Look, Syd.

00:39.416 --> 00:41.666
I know you're gonna miss Brooklyn. Okay?

00:42.416 --> 00:45.083
But you won't miss the smell
of hydrogen sulfide every morning.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.166
Because Bridge Hollow
smells like… …apples

00:50.791 --> 00:52.291
and a hint of white privilege.

00:53.875 --> 00:57.708
And it was named "safest small town
in the US" last ten years running. So…

00:57.791 --> 01:01.500
Give Bridge Hollow a chance.
Small towns can be full of surprises.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.208
And speaking of surprises…

01:30.125 --> 01:31.333
Whoa!

01:34.958 --> 01:35.791
What?

01:35.875 --> 01:37.708
<i>Ahoy there, matey!</i>

01:43.041 --> 01:45.625
Is it me,
or did we just drive in to a Party City?

01:53.416 --> 01:55.333
Look! There it is.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.541
Home sweet home.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.833
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

01:59.416 --> 02:02.875
If we left Brooklyn
20 minutes after the movers,

02:03.541 --> 02:07.291
and they show up in the next two,
how much faster did we--

02:07.375 --> 02:10.291
Whoa! Check out those zombies!

02:10.375 --> 02:12.083
Oh yeah. Okay.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.000
That's not disturbing at all.

02:15.291 --> 02:18.250
Hey, babe, let's not invite
those neighbors over for dinner.

02:19.250 --> 02:22.500
Dad, since we're not living
in an apartment anymore,

02:22.583 --> 02:25.500
maybe we can finally decorate
our house for Halloween!

02:25.583 --> 02:28.208
Uh…

02:28.291 --> 02:31.375
-You didn't answer my question.
-Mom, can we get a ruling?

02:31.458 --> 02:33.416
-Yes, I mean--
-You gonna take me to Family Court?

02:33.500 --> 02:35.375
It would be nice to fit in
with the neighborhood.

02:35.458 --> 02:39.000
But, you know, we're gonna be so busy
moving in and getting ready for school.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.791
-The court rules in favor of Dad.
-Mmm.

02:41.875 --> 02:42.708
I'm sorry, baby.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.375
Maybe next year?

02:44.458 --> 02:45.875
The system's rigged.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.166
Okay. Let's go.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.041
It's the movers!

03:41.333 --> 03:42.833
Careful. Fragile package.

03:42.916 --> 03:45.125
-Ha, ha, ha. Thank you.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.625
-Kid's room. Upstairs.
-Okay.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.875
Hey, neighbor! What's shakin'?

03:49.958 --> 03:53.250
John Sullivan.
But everyone around here calls me Sully.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.000
Except for my ex-wife.
I don't wanna tell you what she calls me.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.416
-Howard Gordon. My wife calls me "honey."

03:59.500 --> 04:01.916
-That's… That's tough.
-Yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.916
Well, hey, listen,
you picked a hell of a time to move in.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.291
As you can see, everybody around here
kind of goes crazy around Halloween, huh?

04:08.375 --> 04:11.000
Yeah. It's a little ridiculous, right?

04:11.083 --> 04:11.916
Huh?

04:12.791 --> 04:16.208
No, I meant, uh, "crazy" as in "good."

04:18.500 --> 04:21.208
-Oh yeah. I--
-Yeah.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.541
-Really? Yeah.
-Yeah! Yeah.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.500
See, the way it works here
is everybody kind of picks a theme,

04:26.583 --> 04:30.291
and then you go big-time on that theme.
Really lean into it.

04:30.375 --> 04:31.458
You gotta commit.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.958
This year, I pulled out all the stops.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.916
<i>The Walking Dead. </i>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.500
-Booyah!
Yeah…

04:39.583 --> 04:42.333
Not a fan. They jumped the shark
when they killed Glenn.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.250
Yeah, that was a loss for everybody.

04:46.916 --> 04:49.500
-So you got a theme?
-No.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.041
-You like werewolves?
-Not particularly.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.541
'Cause I got
a whole shed full of werewolves.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.250
That's real wolf fur.
I don't even know if it's legal.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.166
And I don't care. 'Cause it's Halloween.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.291
Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.666
-Really?
-We don't decorate.

05:02.541 --> 05:03.458
Jehovah's Witness.

05:03.541 --> 05:06.916
No, I… just… think it's… kind of silly.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.291
-What?
-Do you still believe in Santa Claus?

05:13.375 --> 05:16.041
Why? What have you heard? Is he okay?

05:17.666 --> 05:18.708
Nice meeting you.

05:18.791 --> 05:21.541
Great meeting you too, Howard.
Hey, you want that werewolf?

05:21.625 --> 05:24.666
I can get that werewolf into your yard
in five minutes. It's not a problem.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.583
-No, I'm– We're good.
-Wife got you on a short…

05:27.666 --> 05:30.958
-Yeah, I get it.
-Go. Turn around. Keep going.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.333
So, how unhappy
do you think Syd is about the move?

05:41.416 --> 05:42.416
One to ten?

05:42.500 --> 05:45.375
They haven't invented
a scale big enough to measure this one.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.083
I don't know.

05:48.916 --> 05:52.416
I feel like she's turning into somebody
I don't even recognize anymore.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.500
Well, that's what teenagers do, baby.

05:56.583 --> 05:59.750
They… they grow up.
They become their own person.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.375
And you have to let her.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.708
And what's that supposed to mean?

06:05.791 --> 06:07.833
You pushed her to be on the science team.

06:07.916 --> 06:09.833
Yeah, because she loves science.

06:10.458 --> 06:11.583
And science…

06:13.458 --> 06:14.291
is awesome.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.916
She wanted to take ballet.

06:17.000 --> 06:17.833
Right.

06:18.333 --> 06:21.500
But now, our baby girl can defend herself.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.541
You can't fight off a mugger
doing a pirouette.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.333
Howard, this isn't Brooklyn.

06:27.416 --> 06:31.666
The scariest things around here
are the decorations on people's lawns.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.000
-Just…

06:34.458 --> 06:35.833
give her some space.

06:41.750 --> 06:42.666
Okay.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.583
I'm putting it up.

07:17.958 --> 07:21.041
Look, Howard! Don't you think
that would be perfect for my bake shop?

07:21.125 --> 07:22.625
Are you sure about this?

07:22.708 --> 07:24.958
Running a bakery
is a lot different than being a lawyer.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.250
I'm sure. I even decided on a name.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.333
The Bridge Hollow Bakery.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.125
Might wanna workshop that one.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.291
-Hey, Mom.
-Huh.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.250
Are you gonna sell
things you normally make

07:34.333 --> 07:35.541
or things that taste good?

07:35.625 --> 07:39.291
Ha ha. I know you guys usually hate
on anything without gluten or butter,

07:39.375 --> 07:42.458
but the PTA moms in Brooklyn
love my sugar-free pumpkin pie

07:42.541 --> 07:43.708
with almond-powder crust.

07:43.791 --> 07:46.541
-And this town is gonna love them too.
-I'm sure they will.

07:46.625 --> 07:50.166
-Hey, there they are! The Gordons!

07:50.250 --> 07:51.833
Baby?

07:52.625 --> 07:55.458
Why does the crazy white lady
in the pumpkin car know who we are?

07:55.541 --> 07:56.916
You're probably wondering,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.333
"How does this crazy white lady
in a pumpkin car know who we are?"

07:59.416 --> 08:02.541
-No… Yeah.
-Tammy Rice. The mayor around here.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.208
Don't be too impressed.
It's a volunteer position.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.166
I also teach piano and drive an Uber.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.583
You'd be surprised how many people
wanna ride in this pumpkin.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.750
Hey, Howard, your first ride's on me, huh?

08:11.833 --> 08:14.958
-Big science teacher from the big city!

08:15.041 --> 08:16.166
Ah, no, thank you.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.458
And what is all the signs up
for Stingy Jack?

08:18.541 --> 08:19.833
Who is he? The town founder?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.583
Wait, you've never heard of Stingy Jack?

08:21.666 --> 08:24.833
Okay. Well,
I turned his story into a sweater.

08:24.916 --> 08:25.958
-So…

08:26.041 --> 08:28.333
According to an old Irish legend,

08:28.416 --> 08:31.458
there once lived
a wicked man named Stingy Jack.

08:31.541 --> 08:33.166
And he was such a jerk

08:33.250 --> 08:36.333
that the villagers finally had enough,
and…

08:37.708 --> 08:40.916
But the devil felt sorry for Jack,
so he made him a lantern.

08:41.583 --> 08:44.666
A pumpkin carved out with a flame
from the fires of hell.

08:44.750 --> 08:45.625
Hmm?

08:46.208 --> 08:51.333
Every Halloween, Jack would return
to our town, Bridge Hollow,

08:51.416 --> 08:55.166
to seek his revenge on the descendants
of the villagers who did him in.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.625
Well, that's what we tell the tourists.
Am I right?

08:59.916 --> 09:03.208
Wait, so that's why
they call them jack-o'-lanterns!

09:03.291 --> 09:06.458
Hey, Syd, what do you say
we go hit up the local museum

09:06.541 --> 09:08.708
where we can learn some actual facts.

09:08.791 --> 09:10.958
Uh, no. I'm gonna explore this town

09:11.041 --> 09:13.416
and find something
that's actually fun to do.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.708
She'll be fine.
Safest small town in the US, remember?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.916
That's right, but don't let
any of those sore losers in Oaktown

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
hear you say that.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.958
They didn't even make the top ten.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.625
Uh, so, is there gonna be
any food at this festival?

09:26.708 --> 09:29.916
Of course! Yeah, a lot
of the local stores are setting up booths.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.916
We got hot dogs, funnel cakes,
chowder, everything.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.500
Uh, is there gonna be
any artisanal vegan baked goods?

09:36.083 --> 09:39.083
Hmm. I don't know what that means.
But sure, why not?

10:24.333 --> 10:25.208
Whoa!

10:25.291 --> 10:28.541
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.208
What were you guys doing in there?

10:30.291 --> 10:31.166
Grave-digging.

10:31.833 --> 10:35.666
You can get really good money
on the dark web for a fully intact corpse.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.000
I'm kidding.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.500
Show her, Mario.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.958
Um, testing out
this new spectral EM four detection app.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.875
It measures
electromagnetic field fluctuations.

10:44.958 --> 10:45.916
Which is what happens

10:46.000 --> 10:48.958
whenever the electrical charges in the air
are disturbed by a--

10:49.041 --> 10:51.458
Ghost or other paranormal phenomena.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.875
So, what are you guys?

10:54.958 --> 10:58.333
Like, the Bridge Hollow High
Paranormal Society or something?

11:02.750 --> 11:04.458
See? I told you the shirts were lame.

11:04.541 --> 11:05.958
No, I like them.

11:06.041 --> 11:06.958
Who is this girl?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.583
Guys, don't be weird.

11:08.666 --> 11:12.416
I'm Jamie. That's Ramona. This is Mario.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.708
Sydney.

11:13.791 --> 11:15.041
Wait. Sydney Gordon?

11:15.541 --> 11:17.708
You and your folks just moved
to the old Hawthorne house.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.250
The what house?

11:21.500 --> 11:24.291
Come on.
There's something you need to see.

11:25.958 --> 11:30.166
Madam Hawthorne. One of the preeminent
spiritualist mediums of the 20th century.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.583
She lived and died in your house.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.666
Rumor has it she might still be there.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.416
Wait, so I might live in a haunted house?

11:37.500 --> 11:39.416
This place just got a lot cooler.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.625
So, you're, like, into this kind of stuff.

11:42.708 --> 11:46.583
Yeah. Kinda. I was gonna start
a Paranormal Club at my school, but…

11:46.666 --> 11:48.750
You didn't wanna be a social leper.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.416
No. My dad wanted me
to join the science team instead.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.916
Wow, he… sounds so… awesome.

11:57.375 --> 12:01.583
So, have you experienced anything strange
in your house since you moved in?

12:01.666 --> 12:03.166
-Cold drafts?
-Power fluctuations?

12:03.250 --> 12:05.041
Voices from beyond the grave?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.666
Well, I did hear
this weird noise the other night,

12:07.750 --> 12:10.375
and it was
definitely not the house settling.

12:13.875 --> 12:17.458
Well, in that case,
we have some homework for you.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.208
Okay, not exactly sure
how this works,

12:33.125 --> 12:34.375
but here goes nothing.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.416
Madam Hawthorne.

12:39.875 --> 12:40.833
Can you hear me?

12:48.458 --> 12:49.666
H…

12:50.458 --> 12:51.416
E…

12:53.291 --> 12:54.500
R…

12:56.375 --> 12:57.250
Here?

12:58.833 --> 12:59.791
You're here?

14:03.583 --> 14:04.500
Hello?

15:13.916 --> 15:16.500
"SJ 1927."

15:42.583 --> 15:44.041
Ah!

15:44.708 --> 15:45.625
Mmm.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.208
So you guys
are not gonna believe this,

15:48.291 --> 15:49.958
but this house is totally haunted.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.166
What?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.750
-No! For real!

15:53.833 --> 15:55.958
By an old Gypsy woman named Hawthorne.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.208
She used to live here in this house.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.666
And for some reason,
she gave me her pumpkin, but…

16:00.750 --> 16:03.958
Oh, I get it. And that's why
we should move back to Brooklyn.

16:04.041 --> 16:07.708
I'm not making this up.
Haven't you heard all the freaky noises?

16:07.791 --> 16:11.125
It's an old house, sweetie.
Old houses are like old people.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.958
-They make freaky noises.
-Yeah, and they're drafty.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.833
It's the wood. It expands. It contracts.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.541
It's not ghosts. It's science.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.750
Let me tell you what happened.
I was using the Ouija board app--

16:21.833 --> 16:23.791
Oh, come on. A Ouija board is nonsense,

16:23.875 --> 16:25.416
and an app is even worse.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.416
What's the ghost supposed to do?
Get a Wi-Fi password?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.791
Ow!

16:29.875 --> 16:32.541
I don't know why I even bothered.
I should have known.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.458
Known what?

16:34.041 --> 16:36.833
That you would make fun of me
for believing in things like this.

16:36.916 --> 16:38.416
Just like you always do.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.750
I… I do not. Do I… do I make fun…

16:41.833 --> 16:43.500
You just did.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.333
Well, it's not what I meant.

16:46.416 --> 16:49.166
I just want you to start
looking at the world scientifically.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.375
Then you'll realize
that all these crazy things

16:52.458 --> 16:54.666
have a much more realistic explanation.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.958
So you weren't making fun of me.
You just think I'm stupid. Okay.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.416
Wait. I… I didn't say you were stupid!

17:04.125 --> 17:05.208
Just ignorant.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.250
-I'm about to smack you.

17:16.041 --> 17:20.125
Oh! There he is! In the flesh.
The man, the myth, the legend.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.500
Principal Pretty-Boy Floyd.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.208
Good to see you again, buddy.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.416
Thanks for the help getting us settled.
I appreciate it.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.041
Oh, no, Howard.
Thank you for stepping in midsemester.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.958
You really saved my behind.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.750
Boy, when Mr. Viveros won the lottery

17:32.833 --> 17:35.250
and took off
to Key West with his mistress,

17:35.333 --> 17:36.833
it really put us in a pickle.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.208
-Yeah…
-Oh…

17:38.291 --> 17:40.666
-You don't play the lottery, do you?
-No.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.083
Okay.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.208
-And the marriage?
-Solid.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.958
-Really?
-Jay-Z/Beyoncé.

17:47.541 --> 17:49.500
-I'll show you the classroom.
-All right.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.375
Well, here it is.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.041
Check it out.

17:55.666 --> 17:58.083
Wow! We didn't have all this in Brooklyn.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.583
-Yeah.
-This is great.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.125
Brand-new microscopes.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.041
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Bunsen burner at every station.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.750
-These are yours now.
-Thank you.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.458
-We got a brand-new sterilizer here.
-Nice.

18:08.541 --> 18:11.291
-Chemical cabinet, fully stocked.
-Okay.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.000
-Whoa!

18:17.583 --> 18:18.625
Ah, look at this!

18:18.708 --> 18:21.583
The kids on the science team
rigged this one up for you.

18:21.666 --> 18:23.041
-You like it?
-No, no, no.

18:23.125 --> 18:26.208
They call him Albert Spine-stein.

18:26.291 --> 18:27.666
Get-- Ooh.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.666
Get… Get him off.

18:29.750 --> 18:30.625
That's funny.

18:30.708 --> 18:31.958
Did we get you?

18:32.041 --> 18:34.500
Yeah, you got me.

18:34.583 --> 18:37.125
Yeah, Howard.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.416
Come on in, kids.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.875
This is, uh, Mr. Gordon,
your new science teacher.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.791
He'll be with you
for the rest of the semester.

18:46.916 --> 18:49.666
I have never been so scared.
When I opened the trunk,

18:49.750 --> 18:52.625
I thought it was gonna be,
like, this severed head inside.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.833
Turned out it was
just some broke-ass pumpkin.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.625
Oh, that reminds me. I…

18:59.125 --> 19:01.208
I don't know
what you got planned for tonight,

19:01.291 --> 19:03.333
but we'll be back up at the school,

19:03.416 --> 19:06.000
working the…
the "Halls of Horror."

19:06.083 --> 19:08.708
You should come. It's… sick.

19:08.791 --> 19:11.541
We go every year.
So it's obviously super cool.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.541
Okay. It's a little cheesy.

19:13.625 --> 19:17.041
But everyone wears a costume,
and it's fun to check them all out.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.958
Yeah, sounds really cool, guys,
but I don't really have a costume.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.958
My family doesn't really do Halloween.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.875
What does that even mean?

19:28.958 --> 19:32.791
It's my dad's thing to hate on Halloween.
He says he thinks it's stupid.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.291
This guy just doesn't get it.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.750
But I honestly think,
for some dumb reason,

19:37.833 --> 19:39.458
it actually freaks him out.

19:40.041 --> 19:43.958
No pressure, but you know where to find us
if you change your mind.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.083
-Okay.
-Bye.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.833
Hmm. Screw it.

20:31.166 --> 20:34.416
-Hey, do you want a headband?
-Oh! Thanks.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.666
-Trick or treat!

20:47.166 --> 20:48.250
Oh!

20:48.333 --> 20:49.375
Oh!

20:49.458 --> 20:53.125
Kid, never ever jump
out the bushes on a Black man.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.708
Leave candy on your porch next time.
It's Halloween.

20:55.791 --> 20:59.166
Boy, you better get
your little behind off my… property.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.875
Aw, come on, Sully.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.208
A rubber bat.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.125
Trick or treat!

21:41.208 --> 21:42.291
Sydney!

21:47.916 --> 21:48.875
Hi, Dad.

21:51.791 --> 21:52.875
Okay.

21:54.041 --> 21:56.166
Okay. I see what you're doing.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.250
What am I doing?

21:57.333 --> 22:00.583
If I had to guess,
I'd say trying to annoy me.

22:00.666 --> 22:04.708
No, I'm trying to have fun.
Annoying you is just the bonus.

22:04.791 --> 22:09.500
Look, I'm sorry if you thought
I was making fun of you.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.750
And for moving me here.

22:10.833 --> 22:14.000
-I did that for our family.
-And for treating me like a child.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.791
You are a child.

22:15.875 --> 22:20.125
Do you want to know something, Dad?
I'm done being treated like a baby.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.625
I'm 14. I can make my own decisions,

22:22.708 --> 22:25.625
starting with what holidays
I choose to celebrate.

22:25.708 --> 22:29.333
Oh, and you know that science team
you love so much?

22:29.416 --> 22:31.500
Yeah, well, I hate it, and I quit.

22:34.833 --> 22:35.875
Yeah?

22:35.958 --> 22:37.291
Well, how about this?

22:38.041 --> 22:39.208
You're grounded.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.291
What? Why?

22:41.875 --> 22:44.458
Because I'm your father, and I said so.

22:44.541 --> 22:45.583
Now go to your room.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.500
Hmm?

22:55.625 --> 22:58.666
You heard me. I said, go to your roo--

23:02.250 --> 23:05.750
Cute. Little trick candle?

23:06.250 --> 23:08.375
Little magnesium on the wick?

23:08.458 --> 23:11.041
I got something for you. Hmm?
How about that? Hmm?

23:15.875 --> 23:17.541
What about that?

23:18.375 --> 23:19.875
Okay.

23:21.916 --> 23:23.375
How do you like those apples?

23:24.916 --> 23:27.916
You and your little tricks.
Thinking you all grown.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.625
-Dad, it was still lit!

23:30.708 --> 23:33.833
-Relax. Saliva neutralized-- What the…

23:46.583 --> 23:47.625
Oh shit!

23:47.708 --> 23:48.958
Hey, watch your mouth!

23:49.041 --> 23:51.333
-Ah, shit! Shit!

23:54.041 --> 23:55.041
Ah!

23:59.166 --> 24:00.250
Oh!

24:06.625 --> 24:08.250
Come here! Come.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.583
I can't believe
you brought a bat into our home!

24:11.666 --> 24:14.041
Dad! Do you really think
I went into some cave,

24:14.125 --> 24:16.000
found a live bat, and brought it home?

24:16.083 --> 24:17.791
Not all bats live in caves.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.916
Actually, some species,
they live under bridges or in trees.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.375
You know, it's funny,
the western red bat--

24:23.458 --> 24:25.208
Dad, the bat isn't real!

24:25.291 --> 24:26.666
-Whoa!

24:26.750 --> 24:28.666
It sure looked real to me!

24:42.666 --> 24:44.208
Where is it?

24:44.291 --> 24:45.375
I don't know.

24:47.708 --> 24:49.250
Dad!

25:05.500 --> 25:07.125
Look how much candy I got.

25:14.375 --> 25:16.166
If you're trying to annoy me,

25:16.250 --> 25:17.125
it worked.

25:17.625 --> 25:18.916
Oh, it worked.

25:41.041 --> 25:44.916
Uh, Dad, I think
something really weird is going on.

25:55.666 --> 25:58.250
-And I'm gonna find out what it is.
-Oh, no, you're not.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.083
You're grounded, remember?

26:01.333 --> 26:03.041
Wait, who… who are you calling?

26:04.583 --> 26:08.333
You can call God for all I care, so…
I said what I said.

26:08.916 --> 26:11.916
-Hey, Syd, what's up?
-Mom, there's some spooky sh…

26:12.500 --> 26:16.000
"stuff" happening tonight.
I know it sounds weird,

26:16.083 --> 26:18.375
<i>but the Halloween decorations</i>
<i>are coming to life.</i>

26:18.458 --> 26:21.500
I want to find out what's going on,
but Dad won't let me.

26:21.583 --> 26:22.541
Gimme the phone.

26:23.958 --> 26:28.041
-Emily, listen, your daughter is trippin'.
-<i> No. Think about your daughter.</i>

26:28.125 --> 26:31.125
She wanted to stay in Brooklyn.
And you said no.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.208
-I know, but you--
-She wanted to decorate the house.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.208
And you said no.

26:35.791 --> 26:37.625
<i>She wanted to take ballet.</i>

26:38.125 --> 26:40.875
-Baby, you said no.
-But… but that's for her safety.

26:40.958 --> 26:44.916
We are not saying no to this.
It's Halloween. Let her have some fun.

26:45.666 --> 26:46.791
<i>Put me on speaker.</i>

26:51.625 --> 26:53.250
<i>The court rules in favor…</i>

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
<i>of Sydney.</i>

26:55.083 --> 26:56.583
-Yes!
Damn.

26:56.666 --> 26:58.666
The system works.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.583
Okay.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.458
You can go, but I'm going with you.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
-What?
-Look.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.833
Halloween brings out all the crazies,
even in a safe town like this.

27:07.916 --> 27:12.083
No. Mm-mm. Tomorrow, you get space.
Tonight, you get me.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.000
<i>Court agrees!</i>

27:13.083 --> 27:14.375
Yeah!

27:14.458 --> 27:15.625
<i>Have fun, you guys.</i>

27:15.708 --> 27:18.666
Come by the Stingy Jack Festival.
I have treats waiting.

27:22.583 --> 27:25.166
<i> Brains…</i>

27:25.916 --> 27:28.500
Don't worry, kids.
These, uh, zombies won't bite.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.708
Or will they?

27:32.666 --> 27:36.291
I'm just busting your beans.
Get in there. Get the good stuff.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.625
Booyah!

27:41.708 --> 27:43.583
That worked too good. That was too good.

27:43.666 --> 27:45.833
You should've seen your faces.
You look ridiculous.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.875
You got nailed. You got smoked.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.666
I'm just kidding. You guys recovered.
That was a good recovery. I like that.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.125
Come on, grab some stuff here.

27:53.958 --> 27:56.458
There you go. That's for you.
Little something for you.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.083
A couple for you. There you go.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.083
Enjoy it.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.666
You're welcome.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.000
Be careful out there. A lot of freaks.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.291
Back to bed, Mrs. Sullivan.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.000
Eh.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.458
Come on.

28:25.708 --> 28:26.583
What the…

28:27.708 --> 28:28.833
Where'd you come from?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.083
Hey, get out of here. Beat it. Will ya?

28:33.625 --> 28:35.708
-Feisty little one, huh?

28:39.416 --> 28:41.125
Didn't see that coming,
did you?

28:41.833 --> 28:43.666
All right, let's go. Get out of here.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.083
See, Dad? I told you.

28:56.166 --> 28:59.958
The bat's eyes were glowing red,
just like this pumpkin.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.083
Just like the witches
from across the street.

29:03.125 --> 29:03.958
Right.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.458
Witches coming to life.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.500
Okay. So what's your plan?

29:11.291 --> 29:14.000
Drive around town, looking for
Halloween decorations with red eyes?

29:14.083 --> 29:16.625
Someone has to do something,
and it might as well be--

29:20.083 --> 29:22.041
Wait, Syd. Where are you going?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.458
Get off me!

29:36.125 --> 29:38.416
Brains…

29:38.500 --> 29:39.875
Brains…

29:40.500 --> 29:41.416
What the…

29:41.500 --> 29:44.250
-Brains…
-Whoa!

29:44.750 --> 29:48.208
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

29:48.291 --> 29:50.250
Oh, come on now. Oh, here we go.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.125
Now those are
some impressive animatronics.

29:55.833 --> 29:59.125
Way more impressive
than a… stupid werewolf in the shed.

29:59.208 --> 30:00.958
Eat lead, bastard!

30:01.875 --> 30:03.458
Oh yeah.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.500
Oh! That worked. Okay.

30:06.583 --> 30:07.708
Come on. Well…

30:08.333 --> 30:09.541
Oh no!

30:13.416 --> 30:16.333
Brains…

30:17.958 --> 30:19.291
Now, that's a bit much.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.166
Dad, we have to do something.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.166
It-- Relax, Syd. Okay?

30:23.250 --> 30:26.041
He's just putting on a show
for the trick-or-treaters.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.916
-Although, that is disturbingly realistic.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.666
-I'll do it myself.
-Wait. Syd, wait.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.750
What? Hey, what are you gonna do?

30:39.916 --> 30:42.000
-That… that's not nice, Sydney.
-Oh, yeah!

30:42.083 --> 30:44.791
That was awesome! Oh! Good job.

30:49.958 --> 30:50.791
Brains…

30:54.291 --> 30:56.541
Okay, that--
All right. That's enough play, guys.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.916
Brains…

31:10.625 --> 31:12.666
-Booyah!
-Holy cow!

31:13.666 --> 31:15.041
Syd, are you okay?

31:15.750 --> 31:18.083
What happened here?
Did all these things short-circuit?

31:18.166 --> 31:22.208
I'll tell you what happened here.
One of these zombies just bit me! Huh?

31:23.083 --> 31:25.875
Oh God. Does that mean
I'm gonna turn into one of them?

31:25.958 --> 31:27.291
Is that how this works?

31:27.375 --> 31:30.375
You can't let me turn.
You gotta shoot me. Blow my head off, man.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.500
What? No, I'm not gonna shoot you!

31:32.583 --> 31:36.166
-I don't wanna turn into a zombie!
-You're not gonna turn into a zombie!

31:36.250 --> 31:39.375
-Zombies are fictional creations. Okay?

31:39.458 --> 31:41.958
Dead bodies don't have
functioning nervous systems,

31:42.041 --> 31:44.291
which means they can't move.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.500
Basic biology.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.208
I didn't understand
a single word you just said.

31:48.291 --> 31:50.541
Maybe I should handcuff myself
to the porch just in case.

31:50.625 --> 31:53.166
Or you can get a tetanus shot.

31:53.666 --> 31:55.791
Yeah. Good call, Bill Nye the Science Guy.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.833
-Burn.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.500
You smoked.

32:00.583 --> 32:04.166
Dad, the zombies' eyes were glowing red

32:04.250 --> 32:07.291
just like the bat
and like the flame in Hawthorne's pumpkin.

32:07.375 --> 32:10.083
This all has something to do with her.
I know it does.

32:10.166 --> 32:12.708
-I'm gonna try to contact her.

32:12.791 --> 32:15.958
Oh, come on, not the Ouija board app.
Give me a break.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.541
Maybe there's another option
we can explore.

32:18.625 --> 32:20.666
Okay. What do you suggest? I'm all ears.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.750
How do you propose
we talk to Hawthorne? She's dead.

32:23.833 --> 32:24.958
No, she's not.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.333
No.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.458
-You're talking about old Madam Hawthorne?

32:30.541 --> 32:31.791
Yeah. Oh yeah.

32:31.875 --> 32:34.333
She's as dead as one
of these brain-eating bastards.

32:34.416 --> 32:37.166
But her granddaughter Victoria…

32:38.916 --> 32:40.166
…she's still sucking air.

32:43.541 --> 32:44.375
No…

32:56.708 --> 32:59.291
Even the retirement home is decorated?

33:00.833 --> 33:03.208
-Who wants to trick-or-treat here?

33:03.291 --> 33:06.583
Stay alert. An attack could come
from anywhere at any time.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.916
Yeah. We're in real danger here.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.625
A bumpkin?

33:17.708 --> 33:20.125
No. A pumpkin. With a "P."

33:20.208 --> 33:23.500
It belonged to your grandmother,
Josephine Hawthorne.

33:23.583 --> 33:27.125
That wasn't no pumpkin. It was a turnip.

33:27.208 --> 33:30.208
No, actually,
I'm pretty sure it was a pumpkin.

33:30.291 --> 33:34.958
I know a soddin' turnip
when I see one, Chachi.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.583
-Chachi?
-Miss Hawthorne.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.666
Can you tell us about the turnip?

33:40.583 --> 33:44.541
Ah… It… It was a long time ago.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.625
I got this, Syd.

33:51.583 --> 33:52.416
Look.

33:54.208 --> 33:58.208
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to be, so…

34:02.625 --> 34:03.541
Oh!

34:04.250 --> 34:05.083
Take it easy.

34:05.166 --> 34:08.000
You can have this
after you tell my daughter

34:08.083 --> 34:09.750
everything she wants to know.

34:09.833 --> 34:10.958
-Okay?

34:11.875 --> 34:14.750
How y'all doing?
You need any juice?

34:14.833 --> 34:18.166
It was a dark and stormy night.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.458
Of course it was.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.958
-Why is it never humid and sunny–
-Oh my God…

34:24.041 --> 34:24.916
Okay, go.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.583
Mystics from all over the world

34:27.666 --> 34:31.083
showed up to our house
at the behest of my Grandma Jo.

34:32.375 --> 34:33.500
Madam Hawthorne.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.625
Hurry, we don't have much time.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.041
It's almost midnight.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.875
<i>Their plan</i>
<i>was to use her grimoire,</i>

34:46.958 --> 34:49.458
<i>a book of ancient spells.</i>

34:49.541 --> 34:52.666
All right. Let's get to bewitching.

34:56.708 --> 35:01.083
<i> They held a séance</i>
<i>to conjure the spirit himself</i>

35:01.583 --> 35:05.916
<i>and finally put an end</i>
<i>to the curse of Stingy Jack.</i>

35:06.583 --> 35:10.166
Wait. Stingy Jack. He's real?

35:10.250 --> 35:13.083
He's real, all right.

35:14.125 --> 35:17.333
I seen him with my own two eyes.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.458
With those two eyes?

35:20.541 --> 35:23.041
-Stop.
-Okay, I'm sorry. Continue.

35:23.791 --> 35:28.250
<i>That old lantern</i>
<i>was a gift from the devil himself.</i>

35:29.708 --> 35:34.791
<i>'Twas what allowed Jack to move</i>
<i>between this world and the spirit world</i>

35:34.875 --> 35:36.916
so that every Halloween,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.708
he could torment
the folks of Bridge Hollow.

35:40.791 --> 35:43.916
But the deal was he could only stay here

35:44.000 --> 35:46.291
from sundown till midnight.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.875
Midnight, Eastern Standard Time?

35:48.958 --> 35:50.500
-Dad.
-What?

35:51.291 --> 35:54.958
But Jack wasn't satisfied
with just one night a year.

35:55.041 --> 35:58.166
He wanted every night to be Halloween.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.166
Turns out there was a loophole.

36:04.250 --> 36:07.500
Jack could stay in our world forever,

36:07.583 --> 36:09.708
free to spread his mayhem

36:09.791 --> 36:11.958
if, at the stroke of midnight,

36:12.041 --> 36:16.291
he found another soul
to take his place in the ever after.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.000
<i>But on Halloween night, 1927,</i>

36:29.083 --> 36:33.791
<i>my Grandma Jo put an end</i>
<i>to the old bastard's plan.</i>

36:41.791 --> 36:45.666
Using magic
to trap the ghost of Stingy Jack

36:45.750 --> 36:48.875
inside his own lantern.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.958
So long, Jack.

37:05.833 --> 37:08.958
As long as that old lantern remains unlit,

37:09.041 --> 37:12.250
you kids got
nothing at all to worry about.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.750
Ew!

37:17.458 --> 37:20.458
What if we kind of sort of relit it?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.500
Oh, then you're screwed.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.250
-Hey, Tammy, how are you?
-Not great.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.958
Been getting lots of reports
of decorations

37:27.041 --> 37:28.625
going missing from people's lawns.

37:29.125 --> 37:31.125
Those Oaktown hoodlums
sure love pulling pranks.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.041
-So, what do we have here?
-Oh, well, help yourself.

37:35.125 --> 37:38.375
Everything you see here
is gluten-free, soy-free, and vegan.

37:38.458 --> 37:41.708
Oh. Just what people want on Halloween.
Healthy snacks.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.416
Here. Try this.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.375
It is a red velvet muffin

37:45.458 --> 37:48.250
made with beetroot
instead of artificial dyes.

37:48.791 --> 37:49.750
Hmm.

37:53.416 --> 37:54.250
Wow.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.250
You can really taste the beetroot.

37:57.333 --> 37:58.375
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.041
You got your beet. You got your root.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.750
All mixed in there.

38:04.666 --> 38:06.750
-Yes.
-Hey, have you seen our Stingy Jack?

38:06.833 --> 38:07.875
No…

38:12.458 --> 38:14.791
So the winner
of the pumpkin carving contest…

38:14.875 --> 38:17.458
-Mm-hmm.
-…gets placed on top as the head.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.000
I'm gonna go get
something to wash it down.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.958
Whoo. Gets… gets you in a chokehold.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.416
So, what do you think?

38:35.833 --> 38:39.666
I think Crypt Keeper fairy girl
is one bird short of a cuckoo clock.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.625
And that old lantern is clearly a pumpkin.

38:43.333 --> 38:46.500
Dad. Seriously?
What if Victoria's telling the truth?

38:46.583 --> 38:49.833
What if it wasn't Madam Hawthorne
I was talking to on that Ouija board?

38:49.916 --> 38:53.875
What if it was Stingy Jack who tricked me
into finding his old lantern.

38:53.958 --> 38:56.708
Then, when I relit it,
I woke him up or let him out,

38:56.791 --> 39:00.041
and now he's making all
the Halloween decorations come to life.

39:00.125 --> 39:01.750
Oh, come on, Syd.

39:01.833 --> 39:05.875
Halloween decorations coming to life?
That's just not something that happens.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.708
Now that is a great costume.

39:18.833 --> 39:21.500
Kind of poor taste
for a nursing home though.

39:25.125 --> 39:26.458
Nope, not today.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.750
Oh, wow.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.250
That looks just like
an Australian funnel-web spider.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.500
<i>Atrax robustus. </i>

39:43.083 --> 39:44.166
Um…

39:44.250 --> 39:45.458
Is that bad?

39:45.541 --> 39:47.666
Well, it would be. If it was real.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.583
Good thing these
are just plastic.

39:51.625 --> 39:52.958
Boop!

40:03.708 --> 40:07.125
They're alive!

40:14.250 --> 40:15.416
It's impossible.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.083
Oh!

40:25.208 --> 40:26.041
Stay here.

40:30.666 --> 40:31.875
Okay.

40:33.083 --> 40:34.625
Uh…

40:34.708 --> 40:35.875
Aha!

40:35.958 --> 40:37.083
Ah!

40:37.166 --> 40:39.416
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.291
What chemicals found
in common household cleaning supplies

40:42.375 --> 40:46.000
can be combined
to create a highly acidic solvent?

40:46.083 --> 40:49.666
Maybe now is not the time
for a science lesson!

40:49.750 --> 40:51.041
You got a good point there.

40:55.375 --> 40:56.916
I had it set to "mist."

40:57.625 --> 41:00.208
It would've been
so much cooler if it was "spray."

41:19.166 --> 41:20.000
Syd!

41:23.416 --> 41:24.666
Oh!

41:27.416 --> 41:28.791
Get out! Get out!

41:28.875 --> 41:30.458
Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:30.541 --> 41:32.666
Oh my God! Please help me.

41:36.291 --> 41:38.166
Hey, Death. He's older than me.

41:38.250 --> 41:42.166
The hydrogen peroxide
combines with the acetic acid in bleach

41:42.250 --> 41:44.500
to make peracetic acid.

41:44.583 --> 41:45.916
Super corrosive.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.125
Oh no.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.500
Wasn't there a giant spider on the roof
when we walked in?

42:09.166 --> 42:10.166
Syd!

42:12.583 --> 42:14.708
Come on. Come on!

42:16.791 --> 42:17.666
Oh sh--

42:33.833 --> 42:35.500
Whoa!

42:43.000 --> 42:46.458
Okay. Easy, spider. Okay, listen.

42:46.541 --> 42:47.666
I… I know you're pissed.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.833
I hated the ending of <i>Charlotte's Web</i> too.

42:49.916 --> 42:52.250
They did Charlotte dirty.
It should've been the pig.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.291
Hey. Itsy-Bitsy.

43:20.958 --> 43:23.250
-We've got to get out of here.
-Okay.

43:26.083 --> 43:27.333
Okay.

43:27.416 --> 43:30.375
There's definitely something
unusual going on in Bridge Hollow.

43:30.458 --> 43:31.750
Oh, you think?

43:31.833 --> 43:35.958
But there has to be
a logical, scientific explanation.

43:36.041 --> 43:38.750
Did you not just see
what happened in there?

43:42.708 --> 43:43.791
No, I… I saw it.

43:45.083 --> 43:47.375
And clearly,
there's something crazy going on.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.833
But just because it's crazy
doesn't mean it can't be explained.

43:51.916 --> 43:53.625
What are you talking about?

43:58.166 --> 44:00.166
Dad, what is it?

44:02.208 --> 44:04.041
It was Halloween 1985.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.625
My friends and I,
we were out trick-or-treating

44:07.708 --> 44:10.083
when they dared me to go
into this abandoned building

44:10.166 --> 44:11.708
to prove I wasn't chicken.

44:11.791 --> 44:14.583
But I made a wrong step.
I fell through the floorboards

44:14.666 --> 44:16.083
into the basement.

44:16.666 --> 44:18.250
And that's when I saw them.

44:19.750 --> 44:20.791
Skeletons.

44:21.583 --> 44:22.458
Hundreds.

44:24.208 --> 44:25.333
They were everywhere.

44:26.833 --> 44:28.166
And they were alive.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.291
If that happened to you then,

44:30.375 --> 44:32.375
why don't you think it's happening now?

44:33.375 --> 44:35.458
Because it didn't happen to me.

44:36.250 --> 44:38.416
A month later, I'm in science class.

44:38.500 --> 44:43.708
My teacher tells us that a concussion
can cause temporary hallucinations.

44:44.208 --> 44:45.333
And that was the answer.

44:45.416 --> 44:50.125
From that day on,
I knew everything had an explanation.

44:50.625 --> 44:53.416
-It was science. Not magic.
-So…

44:54.208 --> 44:57.500
It's "eureka!" Not "abracadabra."

44:57.583 --> 45:01.000
Then explain to me
how Granddaddy Long Legs came alive

45:01.083 --> 45:02.541
and tried to eat us.

45:03.541 --> 45:04.375
Well,

45:05.083 --> 45:08.541
maybe it was a gas leak
causing mass hallucinations.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.458
Or maybe it's Stingy Jack.

45:13.333 --> 45:16.416
Well, whatever it is…
it's spreading like a virus.

45:17.583 --> 45:18.625
Which makes sense.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.666
Because it did start with a bat.

45:21.750 --> 45:25.250
Okay, hear me out. Let's just say
hypothetically, this is Jack.

45:25.333 --> 45:29.666
Victoria said her grandmother
trapped Jack inside that old lantern.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
Maybe we could do the same thing.

45:32.583 --> 45:35.458
-Re-trap him.
-Okay, let's say you're right.

45:35.541 --> 45:39.833
Hypothetically, how do we go about
doing something completely fictional

45:39.916 --> 45:41.833
and not at all real,
like trapping a ghost?

45:42.750 --> 45:43.666
I don't know.

45:45.333 --> 45:47.750
But… I know some kids who might.

45:56.875 --> 45:58.500
All right, Syd. Stay close.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.875
Syd. Syd. Sydney.

46:01.958 --> 46:03.416
That's not close!

46:04.041 --> 46:06.875
Hey, guys.
Thanks again for helping me tonight.

46:06.958 --> 46:08.833
-Where are we?
-Here's what we know.

46:08.916 --> 46:11.083
If you wanna trap a ghost,
you're gonna need a spell.

46:11.166 --> 46:13.416
Preferably an old-world
Romani binding spell.

46:13.500 --> 46:16.625
-Know any Gypsy witches?
-Not any that are still alive.

46:16.708 --> 46:18.958
Uh… Is that your dad?

46:19.041 --> 46:19.958
Sydney!

46:21.291 --> 46:22.125
Ah.

46:22.208 --> 46:23.291
Yeah.

46:23.791 --> 46:26.708
Dad, guys. Guys, Dad.

46:26.791 --> 46:28.791
Hi. What's up, players?

46:29.291 --> 46:30.875
Dap it up. Sideways. No?

46:31.875 --> 46:33.041
No love? Okay.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.875
I like the costumes.
Nice. Let me guess.

46:35.958 --> 46:38.375
Uh… …Power Rangers.

46:39.291 --> 46:40.125
Madonna.

46:40.208 --> 46:43.125
Uh… Puerto Rican Prince.

46:43.208 --> 46:44.708
You are so old.

46:45.708 --> 46:47.000
So anything else?

46:47.083 --> 46:49.875
Yeah. I, uh, found this article online

46:49.958 --> 46:53.708
that says when Madam Hawthorne died,
they auctioned off some of her stuff.

46:53.791 --> 46:57.500
One of the items listed is
her old grimoire. Spell book.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.541
I know.

46:59.208 --> 47:02.541
That's it! Dad, we need that book.

47:03.291 --> 47:04.875
Okay, Rico Suave,

47:05.541 --> 47:08.208
does the article say who bought it?

47:08.291 --> 47:11.875
Yeah. This… fancy-pants antiques dealer.

47:12.583 --> 47:13.916
Sheldon Skinner.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.375
Oh, wait, guys. Skinner's here.

47:16.458 --> 47:20.083
Uh, he's wearing a Harvard sweatshirt
and some of those go-to-hell pants.

47:20.166 --> 47:22.916
He bought tickets for the Kreepy Karnevil
in the pumpkin patch.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.458
Then we have to split up.

47:24.541 --> 47:26.166
Okay. Take these.

47:26.250 --> 47:28.666
What are go-to-hell pants?
And am I wearing them?

47:34.125 --> 47:38.458
Did you really mean what you said earlier
about quitting the science team?

47:38.541 --> 47:41.791
Dad, I don't know.
It was really fun when I was younger,

47:41.875 --> 47:44.333
and it was obvious
you really wanted me to do it.

47:44.416 --> 47:46.583
Just like you really wanted me
to do karate.

47:46.666 --> 47:50.208
Step right up, ladies and ghouls,
to a freak-tacular sideshow

47:50.291 --> 47:53.791
of thrills and chills,
here in the Kreepy Karnevil.

47:54.375 --> 47:57.291
That's not how you spell
either of those words.

48:11.916 --> 48:12.750
Dad.

48:13.250 --> 48:14.333
Look.

48:14.416 --> 48:16.500
That means Jack is here.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.750
-What's wrong with you?

48:26.833 --> 48:27.833
Why would you do that?

48:27.916 --> 48:29.166
I am so sorry.

48:29.250 --> 48:30.791
We thought you were someone else.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.041
Oh my God…

48:32.125 --> 48:34.833
Oh, baby. I know. Okay.

48:47.416 --> 48:49.125
Yeah, you never really liked clowns.

48:50.166 --> 48:52.375
Especially ones with axes.

48:59.625 --> 49:00.958
Yeah.

49:05.583 --> 49:06.833
Wait, Syd!

49:07.500 --> 49:09.166
They're just actors.

49:11.666 --> 49:12.625
Hey.

49:13.791 --> 49:16.708
I don't think you're allowed
to touch me unless I sign a waiver.

49:18.666 --> 49:20.166
Hey. Okay.

49:20.250 --> 49:21.250
Let's calm down now.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.416
Just knocked
your little infant friend out.

49:30.333 --> 49:31.750
These aren't actors?

49:37.833 --> 49:39.458
Sydney, they aren't actors!

49:40.125 --> 49:43.458
-Repeat! The clowns are not actors!

49:43.541 --> 49:45.750
So you no longer have the book.

49:45.833 --> 49:47.958
No, I sold it a while ago.

49:48.041 --> 49:50.333
I'd assumed Hawthorne's effects
were of some value,

49:50.416 --> 49:52.916
but apparently,
the only people who care about that junk

49:53.000 --> 49:54.791
are nutjobs and occultists.

49:54.875 --> 49:56.458
No offense.

49:56.541 --> 49:59.500
When you say occultists,
you mean like Satanists?

49:59.583 --> 50:00.791
Not like.

50:01.291 --> 50:02.291
Precisely.

50:02.375 --> 50:05.125
Do you remember
the name of the person you sold it to?

50:05.208 --> 50:06.958
No, I don't remember his name,

50:07.708 --> 50:10.750
but he had a shipping address
I will never forget.

50:10.833 --> 50:14.416
666 Elm Street.

50:16.708 --> 50:19.041
Like I said, nutjobs.

50:20.708 --> 50:22.416
Let's go
to the ticket booth first.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.625
-If she's not there--
-Killer clowns! Killer clowns!

50:25.708 --> 50:28.583
-Uh, Sydney, what's going on?
-Stingy Jack! He's here!

50:28.666 --> 50:29.750
-What?
-Where?

50:29.833 --> 50:31.416
Everywhere!

50:34.375 --> 50:35.875
Syd! No!

50:36.458 --> 50:38.458
It's called the Halls of Horror.

50:38.541 --> 50:41.333
Why couldn't you just go
to the pumpkin patch?

50:56.583 --> 50:57.666
It's a dead end.

51:05.541 --> 51:07.416
-Guys! Over here!

51:11.875 --> 51:13.083
Okay. Which way?

51:13.166 --> 51:14.583
Eeny, meeny, miney…

51:15.666 --> 51:17.041
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

51:24.625 --> 51:25.916
Sydney!

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Dad?

51:27.083 --> 51:27.916
Sydney!

51:34.875 --> 51:35.708
Dad!

51:36.708 --> 51:37.583
Sydney!

51:39.916 --> 51:40.958
Dad?

51:42.583 --> 51:43.666
Dad?

51:45.125 --> 51:47.375
-Hey! Hey. It's me. It's me.

51:48.041 --> 51:49.166
Dad!

51:50.250 --> 51:52.666
-It's okay, kiddo.
-Look, there's an exit sign.

51:52.750 --> 51:53.625
We're almost out.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.000
All right. Back up. Back up.

52:02.791 --> 52:05.916
Okay, Bozo. I'm gonna wipe
that crooked smile right off your face.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.208
Come on. Come on.
Let you know, Homey don't play that.

52:12.708 --> 52:13.750
Oh!

52:14.958 --> 52:16.041
Dad!

52:19.625 --> 52:20.750
-Get him.

52:20.833 --> 52:22.166
Ow!

52:32.041 --> 52:33.375
Oh, night night!

52:33.458 --> 52:34.791
Oh, oh! Nice!

52:35.791 --> 52:39.125
You know, I softened him up for you,
but, uh, way to finish the job.

52:39.208 --> 52:40.125
Sure, you did.

52:40.708 --> 52:41.791
Um, guys?

52:42.875 --> 52:44.333
-Hey.

52:45.208 --> 52:48.041
Why does a clown need an axe anyway?

52:48.125 --> 52:48.958
Go!

52:51.708 --> 52:55.000
To the right! That way!
We parked out front.

53:00.625 --> 53:03.708
-Okay, now what?
-Um, plan B. Bikes!

53:03.791 --> 53:06.666
Well, that would be great
if my dad knew how to ride a bike.

53:07.708 --> 53:09.250
You don't know how to ride a bike?

53:09.333 --> 53:11.708
I was taught books could take me
wherever I needed to go.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
Okay, bikes it is. Go! Go! Go!

53:22.416 --> 53:24.208
This thing is growing exponentially.

53:24.291 --> 53:28.458
Each creature spreads it to another,
which spreads it to another and another.

53:28.541 --> 53:30.958
At its current rate, it'll take over
Bridge Hollow by midnight.

53:31.041 --> 53:35.041
And according to Victoria,
if we can't stop Jack by then,

53:35.125 --> 53:37.208
he could find a soul to swap for his own.

53:37.291 --> 53:39.166
Then every day will be Halloween.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.125
-Maybe we should call the police.
-Dad.

53:41.208 --> 53:44.041
Do you really think
the cops are going to believe any of this?

53:44.125 --> 53:46.833
-You didn't even believe it.
-Because it doesn't make sense.

53:46.916 --> 53:48.916
Not everything has to, Dad.

53:51.083 --> 53:54.500
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

53:54.583 --> 53:58.416
Who will be the face
of this year's Stingy Jack?

53:59.666 --> 54:01.333
And the winner is…

54:02.583 --> 54:04.333
Dan Brown!

54:05.458 --> 54:08.166
Oh my God! Oh my God!

54:08.250 --> 54:11.875
In your face, Gary! In your face!

54:11.958 --> 54:14.708
I did it, Ma! I did it!

54:14.791 --> 54:17.916
We gotta! We gotta!

54:18.000 --> 54:19.916
-Tammy…
-No, no, no, no.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.458
Now let's get this guy up
on old Stingy Jack.

54:47.583 --> 54:50.041
-Okay, this is it.
-No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

54:54.875 --> 54:55.791
Okay.

54:57.625 --> 55:00.541
I'm gonna assume… that wasn't intentional.

55:06.041 --> 55:06.875
Bones.

55:08.541 --> 55:10.500
Why does it have to be bones?

55:11.416 --> 55:14.041
Um… You know, maybe…
maybe I'll just stay right here.

55:14.125 --> 55:16.000
What? No, come on.

55:28.583 --> 55:29.833
Whoa!

55:37.000 --> 55:38.041
Okay.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.291
Are we sure about this?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.541
I've never met
a real devil worshiper before.

55:42.625 --> 55:44.750
Should we be wearing
crucifixes or something?

55:44.833 --> 55:46.333
Only one way to find out.

55:54.750 --> 55:56.541
Principal Floyd?

55:56.625 --> 56:00.250
Well, hey there, everyone.
And, Howard, what a pleasant surprise.

56:00.333 --> 56:01.791
You all trick-or-treating tonight?

56:01.875 --> 56:04.750
Well, you're in luck
because this year, I've got…

56:06.083 --> 56:08.125
miniature toothpastes.

56:16.583 --> 56:18.791
-So, uh, Floyd.
-Uh-huh.

56:18.875 --> 56:20.791
What are you some type
of Satanist or something?

56:20.875 --> 56:23.958
-Oh jeepers. No, Howard.
-What the hell?

56:24.041 --> 56:28.500
I'm a principal in a very small town
with a very big Christian population.

56:28.583 --> 56:31.125
No, no, no. I just, uh, collect things.

56:31.208 --> 56:34.916
You know, some people collect stamps.
Some people collect butterflies.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.458
I collect objects

56:36.541 --> 56:39.375
related to the eternal damnation
of the human soul.

56:39.958 --> 56:40.791
Aha!

56:41.416 --> 56:44.625
I believe this…
is what you're looking for.

56:46.916 --> 56:47.916
Okay, here it is.

56:48.416 --> 56:50.541
<i>"Captus Exspiravit."</i>

56:51.041 --> 56:53.916
<i>"Cum his verbis O spiritus."</i>

56:54.000 --> 56:56.083
Dad. You know Latin. What does it say?

56:59.416 --> 57:01.250
With these words, O spirit,

57:01.833 --> 57:04.250
I banish you to captivity

57:04.333 --> 57:07.250
binding you to blah, blah, blah, blah…

57:07.333 --> 57:08.791
Right on. So how does it work?

57:08.875 --> 57:11.166
Well, it's your typical,
run-of-the-mill binding spell.

57:11.250 --> 57:15.250
You find a nice receptacle, right?
Then you get close enough to your target.

57:15.333 --> 57:16.541
Be careful.

57:16.625 --> 57:19.750
Then you say these magic words, and boom.

57:19.833 --> 57:22.875
-You've trapped yourself a ghost.
-How close do we need to get?

57:23.458 --> 57:24.958
I don't know. I mean, look,

57:25.041 --> 57:27.791
there's no hard-and-fast rules
with these things.

57:27.875 --> 57:29.458
I do know this.

57:29.541 --> 57:32.750
When you say this spell,
you have to believe it.

57:32.833 --> 57:36.041
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, truly believe it.

57:38.708 --> 57:40.416
In your bones.

57:52.458 --> 57:54.125
Please tell me you ordered pizza.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.083
Oh, you must not tip well.

58:15.125 --> 58:17.750
-Let's go, move it.

58:32.750 --> 58:36.000
-You just had to put helmets on them?
-I thought it would be cute.

58:49.666 --> 58:51.666
Sydney! Save the grimoire!

59:05.666 --> 59:07.208
Get the book out of here.

59:13.166 --> 59:14.416
Syd!

59:18.375 --> 59:19.208
I got it!

59:31.666 --> 59:32.875
The spell!

59:32.958 --> 59:35.500
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can get out the back.

59:35.583 --> 59:39.125
No! Dad, we have to get that spell.
It's the only way we can fix this.

59:39.208 --> 59:42.708
We can't fix anything if we're dead.
Now, come on and bring your little ass.

59:45.458 --> 59:47.708
-Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
-Hurry!

59:51.083 --> 59:52.541
Go! Get in the basement!

59:52.625 --> 59:53.750
Go! Go! Go!

59:53.833 --> 59:56.000
Get in the basement!

59:56.083 --> 59:58.166
-Go!
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1:00:07.041 --> 1:00:08.458
Mario, help him!

1:00:12.833 --> 1:00:14.583
Dad. Do something!

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:21.541
Dad! What is wrong with you?

1:00:25.083 --> 1:00:26.125
The skeletons.

1:00:26.208 --> 1:00:28.125
-They're coming through.
-What do we do?

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:30.875
So it's unexplainable.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:33.875
So what? They're real.

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.791
You know what you can do
to something that's real?

1:00:39.250 --> 1:00:41.583
You can kick its ass.

1:00:46.416 --> 1:00:48.333
You can take the girl out of Brooklyn,

1:00:48.416 --> 1:00:50.583
but you can't take Brooklyn
out the girl.

1:00:57.083 --> 1:00:59.333
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

1:00:59.416 --> 1:01:02.166
You know what the chainsaw
was originally called?

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:10.583
A bone cutter.

1:01:15.583 --> 1:01:16.416
Yeah.

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:19.500
This will do just fine.

1:02:09.208 --> 1:02:10.333
Whoa!

1:02:14.375 --> 1:02:16.375
Hmm? What the hell?

1:02:22.875 --> 1:02:24.541
Ahhh!

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:29.750
Whoo!

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:33.958
Whoo, whoo, whoo. Whoo!

1:02:37.416 --> 1:02:38.458
Ah!

1:02:45.416 --> 1:02:47.000
Ahhh!

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.583
-Ahhh!

1:02:54.750 --> 1:02:57.166
Holy Lucifer, Howard.

1:03:00.541 --> 1:03:03.833
Sydney, I take back
everything I said about your dad.

1:03:05.041 --> 1:03:07.791
That was the coolest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:20.666
Boy, I hope somebody
remembers these words.

1:03:26.916 --> 1:03:28.958
What was that?

1:03:43.250 --> 1:03:46.125
The Halloween decorations.
They're gone.

1:03:46.208 --> 1:03:47.750
But where did they go?

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:49.875
The Stingy Jack Festival.

1:03:49.958 --> 1:03:51.333
He's building an army.

1:03:52.625 --> 1:03:53.458
Mom.

1:03:54.083 --> 1:03:56.083
These right here, Father,

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:59.583
are egg-free coconut-pineapple scones.

1:03:59.666 --> 1:04:02.083
-Ah, that's a home run, huh?
-Yes!

1:04:07.041 --> 1:04:08.541
So…

1:04:10.583 --> 1:04:12.416
I'm really not supposed to lie.

1:04:14.083 --> 1:04:16.041
Yeah! Love it!

1:04:16.125 --> 1:04:17.041
Mm-mm.

1:04:17.125 --> 1:04:19.333
Oh, there's our pumpkin. Come on!

1:04:22.666 --> 1:04:26.125
Well… guess it's time
to call it a night.

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.291
Let's hear it for Stingy Jack!

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:35.458
Stingy Jack.
Stingy Jack. Stingy Jack.

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.750
Which way do we go?

1:04:43.291 --> 1:04:45.291
It's still a few more blocks that way.

1:04:45.375 --> 1:04:47.833
Or we can take the shortcut.
Through the cemetery.

1:04:47.916 --> 1:04:49.416
Okay. Let's go.

1:04:51.125 --> 1:04:54.041
Oh, please tell me
they don't decorate the cemeteries here.

1:05:04.541 --> 1:05:06.333
Hey, Syd. What are you doing?

1:05:06.416 --> 1:05:09.041
-Come on, we have to find your mom.
-And then what, Dad?

1:05:09.125 --> 1:05:12.125
Stingy Jack has completely taken over
Bridge Hollow.

1:05:12.208 --> 1:05:15.750
And without Madam Hawthorne's spell,
we can't stop him.

1:05:15.833 --> 1:05:17.375
We need that spell.

1:05:18.166 --> 1:05:19.291
What are you thinking?

1:05:26.125 --> 1:05:27.583
I don't know, guys.

1:05:27.666 --> 1:05:31.458
I led the weekend séance
at the community center a few times,

1:05:31.541 --> 1:05:32.666
but that was years ago.

1:05:32.750 --> 1:05:34.833
Please, you have to try.

1:05:34.916 --> 1:05:38.041
Okay. Um, everybody, take hands.

1:05:38.958 --> 1:05:41.291
Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

1:05:42.958 --> 1:05:46.166
But I am so here for it.

1:05:46.250 --> 1:05:49.833
You know, channeling the… energy.

1:05:49.916 --> 1:05:51.625
-Whatever.
-Thank you.

1:05:53.208 --> 1:05:54.291
Close your eyes.

1:05:55.041 --> 1:05:57.916
Uh, now again,
I'm very much out of practice--

1:06:04.416 --> 1:06:05.333
Everyone.

1:06:23.541 --> 1:06:24.750
Whoa.

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:26.583
Miss Hawthorne?

1:06:28.291 --> 1:06:30.166
Miss Josephine Hawthorne.

1:06:31.041 --> 1:06:32.333
Are you in here?

1:06:33.375 --> 1:06:34.791
Can you hear me?

1:06:34.875 --> 1:06:37.208
Of course I hear you, child.

1:06:39.625 --> 1:06:42.708
I'm not deaf.
I'm dead.

1:06:46.166 --> 1:06:49.375
Hell's bells, what have I done?

1:06:49.458 --> 1:06:51.166
This is so going on TikTok.

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:53.500
Um, I released Stingy Jack.

1:06:53.583 --> 1:06:55.375
You did what?

1:06:55.458 --> 1:06:58.375
It is my honor as mayor of Bridge Hollow

1:06:58.458 --> 1:07:01.333
to light this year's Stingy Jack.

1:07:01.416 --> 1:07:03.583
Yeah. Light it up!

1:07:07.041 --> 1:07:08.041
What on earth?

1:07:08.125 --> 1:07:09.791
-Not good.
-What's going on?

1:07:09.875 --> 1:07:12.958
All right, everyone.
Must have just blown a fuse or something.

1:07:13.041 --> 1:07:16.166
-Is somebody trippin'?
-That is weird.

1:07:18.625 --> 1:07:20.625
What the H-E-C-K is that?

1:07:34.041 --> 1:07:35.625
Is this part of the show?

1:07:35.708 --> 1:07:36.916
Beats me, Father.

1:07:45.875 --> 1:07:48.583
I can't believe
you nitwits

1:07:48.666 --> 1:07:50.458
brought that dusty old demon back to life.

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:53.791
What are you going to do next?
Bring back the black plague?

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:54.875
I don't know.

1:07:54.958 --> 1:07:56.875
You realize
he's going to try to do it again?

1:07:56.958 --> 1:07:58.583
To find a soul to take back

1:07:58.666 --> 1:08:01.500
and trade with the devil
so he can take over the world?

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:04.833
But this time,
he won't let anyone stop him.

1:08:04.916 --> 1:08:06.708
We can stop him.

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.416
Oh!

1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:10.708
And how do you propose to do this?

1:08:11.208 --> 1:08:13.291
You gonna hit him
with your little broomstick?

1:08:13.791 --> 1:08:15.583
-Cast a little spell?
-Exactly.

1:08:16.583 --> 1:08:18.291
The binding spell from your book.

1:08:18.375 --> 1:08:21.333
If you tell us the words,
we can use it to re-trap Jack

1:08:21.416 --> 1:08:23.958
and put him away… forever.

1:08:27.541 --> 1:08:28.916
As you wish.

1:08:31.416 --> 1:08:33.500
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1:08:33.583 --> 1:08:36.958
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1:08:37.041 --> 1:08:37.958
<i>Captivitatem.</i>

1:08:38.041 --> 1:08:42.416
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1:08:43.250 --> 1:08:44.083
Got it.

1:08:44.625 --> 1:08:45.458
Mm-hmm.

1:08:45.541 --> 1:08:49.541
Good for you.
Now can I please go back to being dead?

1:08:52.791 --> 1:08:54.333
Oh, uh, yes, I'm sorry.

1:08:59.041 --> 1:09:00.250
Uh…

1:09:00.333 --> 1:09:03.250
Oh, for the love of--
Where did you learn this?

1:09:03.333 --> 1:09:04.666
From a Cracker Jack box?

1:09:04.750 --> 1:09:05.750
Amateurs.

1:09:14.625 --> 1:09:17.041
-What just happened?
-Huh?

1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:21.250
Why do I smell like an old white lady?

1:09:22.250 --> 1:09:24.000
I know what's going on here.

1:09:24.083 --> 1:09:28.458
It's those degenerates from Oaktown
trying to sabotage our festival again.

1:09:29.166 --> 1:09:30.458
Well, not this year.

1:09:31.458 --> 1:09:32.416
Nuh-uh.

1:09:33.333 --> 1:09:35.875
-You can't hide behind that mask.

1:09:35.958 --> 1:09:38.708
I could smell
an Oaktownie from a mile away.

1:09:39.208 --> 1:09:40.541
You know why?

1:09:40.625 --> 1:09:43.875
Because you reek of sour grapes.

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:47.000
-It's a bunch of Oaktownies.
-We don't want you here.

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:49.791
We don't want any of you weird freaks.

1:09:57.416 --> 1:09:59.333
You shouldn't have done that, clown boy.

1:10:06.708 --> 1:10:10.500
-They're everywhere.
-I'm starting to hate Halloween.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:11.958
We got this.

1:10:13.583 --> 1:10:15.333
Oh, Syd. Look. Over there.

1:10:15.416 --> 1:10:17.625
Mom's booth. Come on.

1:10:18.791 --> 1:10:20.541
Quiet. Quiet.

1:10:37.291 --> 1:10:38.500
Oh, dear Lord.

1:10:39.916 --> 1:10:42.000
Where is she? Where's Mom?

1:10:42.083 --> 1:10:43.166
I don't know!

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:45.291
And where's all the muffins
and cookies and stuff?

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:47.666
Maybe she sold them all
and then went home.

1:10:50.958 --> 1:10:52.625
Okay, Syd. Pop quiz.

1:10:53.833 --> 1:10:56.625
Where is
the big pumpkin-headed statue thing

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:58.333
that was there just a minute ago?

1:11:00.791 --> 1:11:01.875
He's gone.

1:11:02.458 --> 1:11:03.458
What time is it?

1:11:05.583 --> 1:11:06.541
It's almost midnight.

1:11:06.625 --> 1:11:09.916
Dad, we need to find Jack
before he takes someone's soul

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.666
back to the spirit world,
or else we're screwed.

1:11:12.750 --> 1:11:13.750
No, he can't.

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:16.250
If he wants to trade a soul
with the devil,

1:11:16.333 --> 1:11:18.166
he needs the lantern.

1:11:18.250 --> 1:11:20.375
And the lantern is back at the…

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:36.250
Hello?

1:12:00.875 --> 1:12:03.041
I'm trippin'. I'm trippin'.

1:12:06.750 --> 1:12:08.958
So no one wants my baked goods.

1:12:11.916 --> 1:12:13.000
Well, more for me.

1:12:13.708 --> 1:12:14.625
Mmm.

1:12:20.791 --> 1:12:21.666
Dad.

1:12:21.750 --> 1:12:23.208
-What?
-What are you doing?

1:12:23.291 --> 1:12:25.541
I'm looking for wheels.

1:12:25.625 --> 1:12:28.625
A car, a truck, something.

1:12:29.333 --> 1:12:30.250
Anything.

1:12:32.875 --> 1:12:34.208
I don't know.

1:12:41.208 --> 1:12:43.416
Check for keys. Check.

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:45.541
-Okay. Come on…
-Nothing.

1:12:46.166 --> 1:12:48.833
Hey. Never do this.

1:12:51.375 --> 1:12:54.458
Bypassing the ignition
allows the positively charged battery

1:12:54.541 --> 1:12:58.833
to push the negatively charged electrons
to the starter and…

1:12:58.916 --> 1:13:00.875
-Eureka.

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.416
Mm-hmm.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.166
Don't tell Mom about this.

1:13:07.958 --> 1:13:08.791
All right.

1:13:09.458 --> 1:13:10.583
Let's go.

1:13:17.333 --> 1:13:18.500
What are they doing?

1:13:19.250 --> 1:13:20.625
Why are they just standing there?

1:13:21.125 --> 1:13:24.500
The last time Jack tried to steal a soul,
Madam Hawthorne stopped him.

1:13:24.583 --> 1:13:28.208
So this time, he's using his army
to make sure no one gets in his way.

1:13:28.291 --> 1:13:30.708
He'll keep us here till midnight
then attack.

1:13:30.791 --> 1:13:33.875
Yeah. Well, lucky for us,
we're driving this <i>Cucurbita pepo</i>.

1:13:33.958 --> 1:13:36.916
-Or, in layman's terms…
-A squash.

1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:37.875
Hang on.

1:13:54.208 --> 1:13:55.875
Oh, here comes Charlotte!

1:14:01.958 --> 1:14:02.875
Oh!

1:14:04.375 --> 1:14:07.250
Well, there goes
this year's safest small town in the US.

1:14:07.875 --> 1:14:08.833
Yes!

1:14:09.416 --> 1:14:10.250
Whoo!

1:14:23.916 --> 1:14:25.708
That is really hard.

1:14:26.291 --> 1:14:27.666
-Ugh.

1:15:05.125 --> 1:15:08.875
Brains. Brains.

1:15:10.916 --> 1:15:13.916
-Brains. Brains.

1:15:15.416 --> 1:15:17.375
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus…</i>

1:15:17.458 --> 1:15:20.041
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus.</i>

1:15:20.125 --> 1:15:22.416
I tried to get you to learn Latin.
Remember?

1:15:22.500 --> 1:15:27.416
Dad, Latin is literally a dead language,
and at that time, it seemed useless.

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:29.833
Well, it's not so useless now, is it?

1:16:00.875 --> 1:16:02.166
-You ready? Okay.
-Ready.

1:16:02.708 --> 1:16:04.333
-Hi, neighbor!
-Oh!

1:16:04.416 --> 1:16:07.333
Wondering what I'm doing
in your bushes, right?

1:16:07.416 --> 1:16:09.416
I'm not hiding if that's what you think.

1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:11.500
-Yeah, you are.
-I'm not scared of anything.

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:13.416
-You know what I mean? All right.
-That's nice.

1:16:13.916 --> 1:16:16.458
Hey, turns out you were right.
I didn't turn into a zombie, huh?

1:16:16.541 --> 1:16:18.458
-Lucky you.
-Halloween, baby.

1:16:45.750 --> 1:16:48.083
-Oh!
-Oh! Oh…

1:16:48.166 --> 1:16:49.333
It's your husband!

1:16:49.916 --> 1:16:52.875
-Honey?
-What was in that muffin? Cement?

1:16:52.958 --> 1:16:54.708
I get it. I get it. Baking isn't--

1:16:54.791 --> 1:16:56.125
-Look out!

1:16:58.666 --> 1:16:59.625
Mom!

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:11.000
He breathes fire now?

1:17:14.083 --> 1:17:15.083
Come on.

1:17:15.583 --> 1:17:19.541
-Oh! Syd! Back up! Back up! Back up!

1:17:19.625 --> 1:17:21.125
Okay. All right.

1:17:21.666 --> 1:17:23.541
You distract the bat. I'll save Mom.

1:17:23.625 --> 1:17:25.500
But, Dad, I have to do the spell.

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:28.250
Listen. It is too dangerous in there.

1:17:29.250 --> 1:17:34.000
Now, I am still your father,
and sometimes I still need to protect you.

1:17:35.458 --> 1:17:36.458
Okay?

1:17:53.833 --> 1:17:56.000
-Go! Save Mom! I got this.
-Okay.

1:18:01.291 --> 1:18:03.416
All right, Oaktownies! Come get some!

1:18:07.208 --> 1:18:09.208
I don't think
you should be encouraging them, dear.

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:12.000
Don't get some! Don't get some!
I changed my mind.

1:18:12.083 --> 1:18:13.083
Stay back!

1:18:13.583 --> 1:18:16.416
I'm thinking these things
ain't from Oaktown.

1:18:21.666 --> 1:18:23.375
Dad! Hurry!

1:18:23.958 --> 1:18:25.416
We're running out of time!

1:18:30.458 --> 1:18:31.916
Ow.

1:18:37.125 --> 1:18:38.625
All right, rat-face.

1:18:39.125 --> 1:18:42.250
Round two. Ding ding.

1:18:48.291 --> 1:18:49.750
Oh no! No!

1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:52.541
Let me go!

1:18:52.625 --> 1:18:53.666
Let me go!

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.041
Let me go!

1:18:58.208 --> 1:18:59.083
I got you.

1:18:59.166 --> 1:19:01.500
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1:19:01.583 --> 1:19:04.916
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:08.666
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.375
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:17.416
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:22.166
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1:19:24.333 --> 1:19:26.500
-Howard!
-I'm trying.

1:19:27.375 --> 1:19:29.291
Dad, hurry!

1:19:29.375 --> 1:19:31.375
At midnight his army is going to attack!

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:35.125
I've said the spell!
Twice! It's not working!

1:19:35.208 --> 1:19:37.416
You have to truly believe!

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:44.375
Dad! You can do it! I know you can!

1:19:51.375 --> 1:19:53.583
Now cast that frigging spell!

1:19:56.125 --> 1:19:57.916
With these words, O spirit,

1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.833
I banish you to captivity…

1:20:00.916 --> 1:20:03.375
…binding you to the devil's flame!

1:20:20.875 --> 1:20:22.000
Abracadabra.

1:20:49.250 --> 1:20:51.375
-They did it!
-They trapped him!

1:20:51.458 --> 1:20:54.250
Oh, thank God.
I thought they were screwed for sure.

1:21:00.250 --> 1:21:01.583
You see that?

1:21:01.666 --> 1:21:04.083
I'm on a new team, baby!

1:21:04.166 --> 1:21:05.708
-Welcome, son.

1:21:05.791 --> 1:21:07.958
Thank you.

1:21:10.833 --> 1:21:14.041
Well-done, Oaktown. Well-done.

1:21:14.916 --> 1:21:16.333
We'll see you next year.

1:21:16.416 --> 1:21:17.750
See you next year.

1:21:36.333 --> 1:21:37.291
Oh!

1:21:41.208 --> 1:21:43.083
-That's funny?
-Yes.

1:21:46.875 --> 1:21:48.000
So long, Jack.

1:21:53.666 --> 1:21:54.875
Wow, Mr. Gordon.

1:21:54.958 --> 1:21:58.791
I mean, I just wish I could've been there
to see you whip Stingy Jack's ass.

1:21:59.583 --> 1:22:02.250
Sorry, I meant "butt."

1:22:02.333 --> 1:22:04.541
Nah, that's okay. I did whoop his ass.

1:22:06.666 --> 1:22:10.333
I meant, <i>we</i> whooped his ass.
It was a team effort.

1:22:10.416 --> 1:22:13.166
All right, who wants some cinnamon rolls?

1:22:13.250 --> 1:22:14.500
Whoo!

1:22:14.583 --> 1:22:16.750
-Thank you!
-Good luck.

1:22:17.875 --> 1:22:19.208
Wow!

1:22:19.291 --> 1:22:20.541
These are amazing.

1:22:20.625 --> 1:22:22.708
-Incredible.
-They are?

1:22:22.791 --> 1:22:24.375
You should open a shop, Mrs. Gordon.

1:22:24.458 --> 1:22:25.666
Wait a second.

1:22:25.750 --> 1:22:26.833
Hmm.

1:22:29.125 --> 1:22:30.416
Yo, what'd you put in this?

1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:31.958
Butter, sugar, gluten.

1:22:33.583 --> 1:22:36.291
I figured, after last night,
life's too short.

1:22:37.166 --> 1:22:39.708
I'm just happy that Halloween is over.

1:22:39.791 --> 1:22:41.541
You thought last night was crazy?

1:22:41.625 --> 1:22:43.791
You should see
what this town does for Christmas.

1:22:45.458 --> 1:22:46.541
Christmas?

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.416
Ho ho ho.

1:22:52.625 --> 1:22:56.000
I still say we should destroy that thing
and be done with it.

1:22:56.083 --> 1:22:57.750
Dad, we went over this.

1:22:57.833 --> 1:22:59.791
If we destroy the lantern, we--

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:02.416
We could release Jack again.
I know. I know.

1:23:03.125 --> 1:23:05.250
But see, that's why I got this.

1:23:05.333 --> 1:23:06.958
Ammonium phosphate.

1:23:07.041 --> 1:23:08.083
Flame retardant.

1:23:10.833 --> 1:23:12.458
Better be safe than sorry.

1:23:12.541 --> 1:23:14.625
Sounds like someone's a believer.

1:23:14.708 --> 1:23:17.041
Hey.

1:23:18.041 --> 1:23:19.000
Here.

1:23:19.083 --> 1:23:21.166
You want me to lock it?

1:23:21.250 --> 1:23:24.666
Yeah, and then I want you
to take the key and keep it safe.

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:28.500
You're old enough now.
You're old enough to do a lot of things.

1:23:29.875 --> 1:23:31.833
And I'mma try my best to remember that.

1:23:33.083 --> 1:23:34.000
Thanks, Dad.

1:23:53.625 --> 1:23:55.416
You wanna join in or what?

1:24:28.833 --> 1:24:30.958
-Oh, hell, no.
-Oh, hell, no.
