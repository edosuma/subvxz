WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.044
(birds singing)

00:03.128 --> 00:06.423
To Muntz, the first
of my KEG brethren

00:06.506 --> 00:09.134
{\an1}to freefall into
the clutches of matrimony.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.927
Till death
do you part, man.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.262
I'll drink to that.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.638
{\an3}You know, this
whole marriage thing

00:13.722 --> 00:14.764
{\an3}is becoming
like an epidemic.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.099
{\an1}First Andrea,
then Dylan.

00:16.181 --> 00:16.891
{\an3}Now Muntz.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.768
{\an1}'Course Andrea
is getting a divorce.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.270
{\an3}What made you
do it, man?

00:20.353 --> 00:21.438
{\an1}STEVE:
What is a crowbar?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.565
Full moon?
Venus in retrograde?

00:23.648 --> 00:24.816
{\an1}STEVE: Shotgun?
No, no.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.235
Uh, Julie's a great girl,
and I love her.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.611
That's all there is to it.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.155
Hmm.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.823
So which one of you two
are next?

00:31.906 --> 00:33.950
(both laughing)

00:34.033 --> 00:36.453
{\an3}Oh, ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.163
{\an1}Ah, commitment's never
been my specialty.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.122
{\an3}I'll say.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.416
{\an1}However, bachelor parties,
on the other hand...

00:41.499 --> 00:42.625
{\an3}Legendary.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.710
Oh. No, no.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.087
Julie kind of wants
to keep things mellow. I...

00:46.171 --> 00:48.298
{\an1}Muntz, you can't get married
without a bachelor party.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.507
Uh-uh.
It's...

00:49.591 --> 00:51.134
It's un-American!
It's un-American.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.470
You're gonna have the bachelor
party of all bachelor parties.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.846
Oh. Oh, yes.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.015
{\an1}Oh, you're gonna have
the fiesta of all fiestas.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.184
Fiesta del fiestavo. Huh?

00:59.267 --> 01:00.602
Oh, God.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.729
(laughter)

01:04.563 --> 01:06.483
You boys are awfully
chipper this morning.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.692
What do you got there?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.277
{\an3}Oh, just a little
heavy reading material

01:09.360 --> 01:10.487
I found in your room.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.821
{\an3}BRANDON:
Yes, you did.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.031
It's research.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.657
{\an3}Oh, really?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.993
Yes.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.119
{\an1}Guilty Pleasures
is opening tomorrow.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.039
{\an1}It'll be the first store
of its kind in Beverly Hills.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.124
Well, I guess that's progress.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.334
{\an1}BRANDON:
What, am I

01:24.417 --> 01:25.502
in trouble for reading it?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
No, no.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.173
It just makes me feel a little
weird finding it, that's all.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.090
{\an5}That's the way Guilty
Pleasures'
neighbors feel.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.675
They don't want it
in the neighborhood.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.552
Well, I can't say that
I disagree with them.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.179
I wouldn't want
to walk past it

01:36.262 --> 01:37.847
{\an6}every day, either.
BRANDON:
Maybe not.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.557
But they do have
a legal right to be there.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.100
STEVE:
Hey, Kel,

01:41.184 --> 01:42.977
Muntz here is getting married.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.187
You are?!

01:45.104 --> 01:46.147
Congratulations!

01:46.231 --> 01:48.066
{\an3}Oh, thank you.
So, I guess

01:48.149 --> 01:49.859
you won't be buying these
anymore.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.944
Yeah.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.530
Yeah, I should probably cancel
my subscriptions.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.906
(laughs)

01:54.989 --> 01:57.242
Ooh. God, that's gonna hurt.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.249
{\an5}PHOTOGRAPHER:
<i>Oh, baby, you're beautiful.</i>
<i>Right there.</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:05.458
Oh, don't move,
don't move. Right there.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.543
Beautiful. All right. Beautiful.
(camera shutter clicking)

02:06.626 --> 02:09.002
Let me see the apple. Put
the apple up. Fantastic!

02:09.086 --> 02:10.045
Let me see those eyes.

02:10.128 --> 02:10.964
Beautiful, baby.
All right, great.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.341
{\an3}Oh, beautiful. Don't
move. Right there. Ah.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.552
{\an5}Hey, can I get some
more light, please?
MAN:
I'm on it.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.720
The set looks great,
she looks beautiful. Thank you.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.013
It's going good, isn't it?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.431
Yeah, it is.
Can I help?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.100
Yeah, you can make it perfect.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.059
{\an3}It will be.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.352
Ah, it has to be.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.728
{\an1}This catalogue
is really important.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.896
Tell me about it.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.231
It's costing us a fortune.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.232
Worth every penny, though.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.608
{\an1}(chuckles)

02:33.278 --> 02:34.863
{\an1}Stop. Don't touch anything!
I'm sorry, I...

02:34.946 --> 02:36.406
{\an3}Look, they're just...
They're the only

02:36.489 --> 02:37.615
{\an3}dresses I have.
I can't get them dirty.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.033
{\an1}Here, let me
brush them off for you.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.076
No, please, why...
Look, why don't you go

02:40.159 --> 02:41.077
get some coffee or something,

02:41.161 --> 02:42.287
and I'll take
care of this?

02:42.370 --> 02:43.538
Are-are you sure?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.290
Yes, I'm positive. Thank you.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.255
{\an3}A little over the top,
don't you think?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.090
{\an1}They're the only clothes
I brought today.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.758
{\an1}I can't afford
to get them dirty.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.261
{\an3}Yeah, I know, but you
kind of took her head off.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.096
{\an3}I mean, she's just
trying to help.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.599
You're right. I did.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.080
(knocking)

03:26.164 --> 03:27.081
Monica, are you in there?

03:27.165 --> 03:29.167
Uh-huh.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.298
I'm so sorry I yelled at you.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.300
That's okay.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.468
I feel better now.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.677
No, it's not.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.137
I-I'm so embarrassed.
I've just...

03:41.220 --> 03:43.139
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now,

03:43.222 --> 03:46.100
but that's no reason to take it
out on you. I'm sorry.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.815
{\an3}I'm fine.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.150
Thanks.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.194
So, what-what can
I do to help you?

03:56.277 --> 03:58.780
Thank you.

{\an3}You want

<i>Beverly Beat.</i>
This is Steve.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.156
Personal ads? Absolutely.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.949
We're the epicenter
of love connections.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.118
Thank you. Can you call back
a little later?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.120
I'm a little swamped.
Thank you.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.163
Where's Janet?
(phone ringing)

06:12.246 --> 06:14.123
This place is chaos central.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.583
I sent her on some errands.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.085
How many errands?

06:17.168 --> 06:18.628
I haven't seen her in days.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.129
It was a long list.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.130
Obviously.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.425
The truth is, Brandon,
ever since the reunion,

06:24.509 --> 06:26.594
{\an1}it's been kind of
awkward for me.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.262
So what's your point?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.472
I don't know what to say to her.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.640
So your master plan is

06:30.723 --> 06:31.849
to keep her out of the office?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.309
Yeah.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.393
Well, I'm sorry, man,

06:34.477 --> 06:36.813
but you're gonna have to come up
with something else,

06:36.896 --> 06:38.439
because we've got a newspaper
to run,

06:38.523 --> 06:39.649
not to mention the fact

06:39.732 --> 06:41.317
we've got a bachelor party
to plan.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.320
Hey, I never almost dated
someone I work with, okay?

06:44.403 --> 06:47.156
Normally, you go out
with a girl, and if it tanks,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.283
you lose their number,
but Janet...

06:49.367 --> 06:51.828
Is not that easily disposable?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.163
{\an1}Exactly. This is gonna
be a real challenge.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.165
Janet! You're back so soon.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.169
{\an3}Yeah, I made an
executive decision,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.088
{\an3}and I went to the
supermarket for coffee

07:02.171 --> 07:04.340
{\an3}instead of driving all
the way out to Santa Monica

07:04.423 --> 07:06.175
for your special beans.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.176
Oh.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.177
Your taste buds

07:08.261 --> 07:09.512
aren't that highly evolved.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.597
You'll never know
the difference.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.226
Okay.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.520
Bachelor party strategy.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.855
We're gonna need some food--

07:18.938 --> 07:20.022
preferably finger sandwiches--

07:20.106 --> 07:21.732
and then
some live entertainment.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.693
I'm gonna leave
the human resources to you.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.319
{\an6}Brilliant idea.
JANET:
You know, you can get

07:25.403 --> 07:27.071
party favors
at that new sex shop.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.074
{\an3}I was going to go there anyway
to cover the grand opening.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.702
Well, as publisher
of the <i> Beverly Beat,</i>

07:32.785 --> 07:35.079
I feel it's my duty
to accompany you there.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.873
Make sure
no stone goes unturned.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.082
Hmm.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.209
And, uh, no love
oil uninspected.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.839
She seems okay
with this whole sex shop thing.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.007
Healthy girl.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.217
Still waters run deep

07:48.301 --> 07:50.678
and possibly kinky.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.263
I like it.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.521
(Valerie sighs)

08:04.483 --> 08:05.735
Hey, David?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.195
{\an1}DAVID:
Huh?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.031
Wouldn't it be great to get away
for a couple days?

08:10.114 --> 08:11.908
{\an1}DAVID:
Yeah, that sounds great.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.243
I mean, we could go up
to Lake Arrowhead

08:14.327 --> 08:17.079
and stay at a bed-and-breakfast,
do some hiking or something.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.706
{\an1}Yeah, you plan it,
I'll be there.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.249
I mean, it just
seems like forever

08:20.333 --> 08:21.626
since we've had
some time to ourselves,

08:21.709 --> 08:23.252
{\an3}you know?
You know,

08:23.336 --> 08:24.253
with this whole jingle thing,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.922
we could schedule
something during the week

08:26.005 --> 08:27.590
if it's easier for you
to get away from the club.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.592
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.593
We really need this.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.552
Yeah.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.095
Mmm...

08:33.179 --> 08:34.138
{\an1}Mmm.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.097
Mmm.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.599
I got to take a shower.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.726
No!

08:39.684 --> 08:41.729
(sighs)

08:43.147 --> 08:45.316
(water running)

08:56.077 --> 08:59.455
This is one of the last salads
I'm gonna have for a long time,

08:59.538 --> 09:01.123
so I'd better make it last.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.126
Doctor's orders.
What's wrong? Are you okay?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.170
Oh, I'm fine,
but I'm gonna have a facelift

09:06.254 --> 09:08.422
{\an1}next week, and I won't
be able to chew for a while.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.258
I'll be drinking
lots of smoothies.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.134
{\an4}You're kidding me.
Honey, this is
Beverly Hills.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.136
We never joke
about plastic surgery.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.304
Mom, you look great.
What are you thinking?

09:15.388 --> 09:19.183
{\an1}40% off for people in their
forties got me started on it.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.979
The thought of losing the bags
under my eyes sealed the deal.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.188
But your eyes are beautiful.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.441
I look tired after
ten hours of sleep.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.818
Want some dessert?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.111
Do we have any frozen yogurt?

09:30.194 --> 09:33.489
Yup. Bought some
just the other day.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.783
I think we've got chocolate
and vanilla.

09:35.866 --> 09:36.867
Is it nonfat?

09:36.951 --> 09:37.994
Ah, the vanilla is.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.829
I'll have that, then.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.330
Erin, I brought you
some Rocky Road ice cream.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.332
Want me to make you a sundae
with hot-fudge sauce?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.834
Ice cream's fattening.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.960
But you're so skinny!

09:46.043 --> 09:47.670
Yogurt only has 80 calories,

09:47.753 --> 09:49.338
and I don't want to be a blob.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.885
(sighs)

09:57.555 --> 09:59.098
Now, that was a great movie.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.641
{\an3}Yeah.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.310
{\an3}Very funny.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.020
Funny, romantic.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.147
Great movie.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.358
What's going on?

10:09.442 --> 10:12.737
I was just thinking about
my mom getting a facelift

10:12.820 --> 10:14.697
when she completely
does not need one;

10:14.780 --> 10:17.533
{\an3}my seven-year-old sister
watching her weight.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.201
{\an1}You were thinking
about your mom

10:19.285 --> 10:21.037
{\an1}and your sister
during a romantic comedy?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.913
I don't know.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.416
It's like they're all trying
to fulfill this male fantasy.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.043
{\an1}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.046
{\an1}I've heard you and Donna go on
and on about Brad Pitt.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.297
No. I don't know.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.507
The movie just made
me think about it.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.259
Can you imagine a movie

10:35.343 --> 10:38.387
where the 60-year-old woman
gets the 30-year-old stud?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.848
<i>Harold and Maude.</i>

10:40.931 --> 10:42.058
It was a joke.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.100
Just promise
me one thing:

10:43.184 --> 10:44.602
When you're old and gray

10:44.685 --> 10:47.730
and distinguished-looking,
and I'm just old and gray

10:47.813 --> 10:51.108
{\an3}you'll still think I'm
the sexiest thing around.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.736
Well, that's gonna be easy,

10:53.819 --> 10:55.905
{\an1}but will you be able
to get past my Dunlap?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.198
(Kelly giggles)

11:06.290 --> 11:08.084
{\an3}You like him,
don't you?

11:08.167 --> 11:11.212
Oh, goes beyond like.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.171
You know what?

11:12.254 --> 11:13.381
There is a great reggae band

11:13.464 --> 11:14.799
playing at the After
Dark Thursday night.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.801
You should invite him.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.052
I don't know.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.138
{\an3}I think you
should go for it.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.099
{\an1}So, Donna,
I'll see you tomorrow?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.392
Yes, you will.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.227
{\an3}MONICA:
There's, um...

11:26.310 --> 11:29.939
There's a reggae band playing
at the After Dark on Thursday.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.565
{\an1}They're supposed
to be really good.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.943
Sounds like a plan.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.239
See, that wasn't so hard.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.949
I'm actually breathing.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.242
(both laugh)

11:41.325 --> 11:43.119
{\an3}Wait, is there something
on the dress here?

11:43.202 --> 11:44.286
Oh.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.705
Oh, my God, your arm!

11:46.789 --> 11:49.291
Are you okay?

11:49.375 --> 11:49.917
I-I'm so sorry.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.335
I-I just got
this new cat.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.296
{\an1}She's a little overeager
for affection.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.298
{\an1}Can I get this dress
cleaned for you?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.633
No, no, no, that's fine.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.301
We'll just, we'll
use another one.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.845
{\an3}Are you sure?
Positive.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.431
Those scratches look
pretty bad. Do they hurt?

12:03.514 --> 12:06.100
{\an1}Oh, no, no, no,
they're mostly healing.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.102
Um, she's finally getting
out of that kitten stage.

12:08.185 --> 12:11.272
{\an3}Well, maybe you should
just have a doctor check it

12:11.355 --> 12:12.481
in case of infection.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.108
Good idea.

12:14.191 --> 12:17.653
{\an1}So, um, in terms of tomorrow,
I was thinking

12:17.736 --> 12:19.989
{\an1}that I'd get here
around 8:00,

12:20.072 --> 12:21.615
{\an1}have things ready to go
by the time Joe gets here.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.867
Great.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.286
You know, maybe you could look
into having the cat declawed.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.163
{\an1}You know, my apartment
is right next to a bakery.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.708
{\an1}Why don't I pick up
some pastries and coffee,

12:30.791 --> 12:32.585
{\an1}and we can use some of it
with atmosphere

12:32.668 --> 12:34.128
for tomorrow's shots?

12:34.211 --> 12:35.129
That sounds good.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.173
Okay.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.800
Um, well, if there's
anything else that you need,

12:39.884 --> 12:41.844
I left my pager number
next to your purse,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.180
and, uh, don't hesitate to call.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.348
Thanks, you've been a huge help.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.601
Okay.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.357
(door closes)

12:56.400 --> 12:59.862
{\an1}There is no such thing
as a small fantasy.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.740
{\an1}It starts with dirty books
and movies,

13:02.823 --> 13:05.326
{\an3}and then it's strip clubs
and plastic surgery.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.703
{\an1}You're taking this
a little far, don't you think?

13:07.786 --> 13:09.079
{\an3}I just want to know that
when you're with me,

13:09.163 --> 13:10.456
you're thinking about me.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.208
This is ridiculous.

13:12.291 --> 13:17.171
If it's so ridiculous, then
why do you still have this?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.048
It's research.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.549
I told you that.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.510
{\an3}Give me a break. Why
do you really have it?

13:23.511 --> 13:26.263
It's a guy thing.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.224
Okay, it's no big deal.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.267
(sighs)

13:30.351 --> 13:34.605
{\an1}I got it when we weren't
together, how's that?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.690
And that makes it okay?

13:36.774 --> 13:39.401
I don't know why you're making
such a big thing out of this.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.402
It's just a magazine.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.445
Then get rid of it.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.072
Fine.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.574
Happy now?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.535
It's a start.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.080
You know, just 'cause
I threw that one away

13:51.163 --> 13:52.873
doesn't mean
I can't buy another one.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.209
And that makes me feel
real good, thank you.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.044
I'm not trying
to make you feel good, Kel.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.754
This is what I'm trying
to tell you.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.257
This has got nothing
to do with you.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.969
I don't see it that way,
Brandon.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.940
{\an5}WOMAN:
This is a family town!
MAN:
No sex shops here!

14:18.023 --> 14:20.109
{\an5}That's right.
We love our
children.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.944
{\an5}STEVE:
<i>This is</i>
<i>a pretty historic moment, boys.</i>

14:22.027 --> 14:24.113
{\an3}We are about to enter
the first sex shop

14:24.196 --> 14:25.739
{\an3}in the history
of Beverly Hills.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.074
This could make us
pioneers.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.617
{\an1}It's a good crowd here,
buddy.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.452
This is going to make
a pretty good story.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.121
Hey, do you think there's
going to be door prizes?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.622
{\an6}(laughs)
We'll see you
inside, Brandon.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.040
Excuse me, excuse me, hi.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.917
Uh, I'm Brandon Walsh
from the <i> Beverly Beat.</i>

14:37.001 --> 14:38.961
I was wondering, can I
get a comment from you?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.087
Absolutely.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.088
My daughter goes
to elementary school

14:41.171 --> 14:43.132
{\an1}three blocks
away from here.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.592
{\an1}Who's going to protect her
from the kind of element

14:44.675 --> 14:46.176
that shops
at a store like this?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.303
Where are the laws

14:47.386 --> 14:49.471
{\an1}that protect the people
who live in the neighborhood?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.307
Thanks.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.226
{\an1}MAN:
We love our children.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.190
Hey, Mr. Eckersley,

15:00.274 --> 15:01.984
{\an1}I'm Brandon Walsh
with the <i> Beverly Beat.</i>

15:02.067 --> 15:03.277
I'm wondering,
how do you feel

15:03.360 --> 15:04.987
{\an1}about these people
picketing your store?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
Well, I wish my customers
didn't have to deal with it,

15:07.239 --> 15:09.158
but it is added publicity.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.660
A lot of people say
that stores like this

15:11.744 --> 15:14.788
{\an1}sell literature and products
that objectify women.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.166
You got any comment on that?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.168
Yeah, tell 'em
to read the Constitution.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.669
{\an3}As long as I'm not
selling anything obscene,

15:20.753 --> 15:23.422
which I'm not, I'm covered
by the First Amendment,

15:23.505 --> 15:26.008
which means I am free
to sell my products,

15:26.091 --> 15:28.594
and they're free
to complain about it.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.055
(phone rings)

15:31.138 --> 15:32.723
Oh, hey, check this out.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.308
{\an3}It's got fuzzy stuff
on the inside.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.559
Let me see that.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.103
{\an1}Yeah, it says right here
it's fur.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.521
"Fur your enjoyment."

15:39.605 --> 15:41.023
{\an1}(laughs)

15:41.106 --> 15:42.399
Enjoyment how?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.984
{\an1}Oh, Muntz.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.861
What?

15:45.944 --> 15:48.155
{\an1}Whoa, Silver,
what do you got there, buddy?

15:48.238 --> 15:49.448
It's just, uh...

15:49.531 --> 15:50.240
Edible underwear?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.993
{\an3}Could you keep
that down, please?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.536
{\an1}Man, I wouldn't know what
to do with half that stuff.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.246
{\an3}I know you
wouldn't, Muntz.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.206
Hey, don't poke fun.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.041
{\an1}You and Valerie have
some sex life, don't you?

15:59.124 --> 16:00.209
Thanks, guy.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.169
{\an3}Have I mentioned what a
great guy Mr. Eckersley is?

16:02.252 --> 16:03.170
Do you think?

16:03.253 --> 16:05.089
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.216
He's going to buy some
ad space at the <i> Beat,</i>

16:07.299 --> 16:08.509
and he's going to
give us a discount

16:08.592 --> 16:10.219
on anything we
buy here today.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.012
Do you think
that's such a good idea?

16:12.096 --> 16:12.805
{\an3}Think about it,
Brandon.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.057
20% discount
on inflatable sheep.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.183
(claps and rubs hands)

16:18.519 --> 16:20.729
(laughter and chatter)

16:20.813 --> 16:22.564
So how's the catalog coming?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.732
{\an3}Great,

16:23.816 --> 16:26.568
except the stylist--
this girl Monica.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.070
I think something's going on
with her.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.906
{\an1}She has these scars and these
scratches all over her arm,

16:30.989 --> 16:32.533
{\an1}and she claims
they're from her cat.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.202
You don't believe her?
Uh-uh.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.079
{\an3}I've never seen scratches
like that from a cat.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.372
And she was bleeding.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.456
Don't you think that's weird?

16:39.540 --> 16:44.086
Is she by any chance
totally accommodating, selfless,

16:44.169 --> 16:46.588
always sacrificing herself
for others?

16:46.672 --> 16:47.589
A dream assistant.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.258
Why? What does that say?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.592
Well, I could be wrong,

16:50.676 --> 16:53.137
but it sounds
like this thing called cutting.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.263
What's that?

16:54.346 --> 16:55.139
Well, it's a disorder

16:55.222 --> 16:56.014
where people actually
cut themselves.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.267
We have a pamphlet on it
at the clinic,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.810
and I read an article
in the <i> New York Times.</i>

16:59.893 --> 17:02.062
People cut themselves?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.105
That's horrible.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.107
Is she suicidal?
Probably not.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.651
Cutters are
really self-loathing.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.945
By doing this, they can control
the pain they experience.

17:11.029 --> 17:11.989
{\an3}Maybe we're jumping
the gun here.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.282
{\an3}We don't actually know
Monica's cutting herself.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.911
To think that someone
would willingly hurt themselves

17:17.994 --> 17:18.787
like that.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.248
You might want
to keep an eye on her.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.131
Do magazines like this
make you uncomfortable?

17:29.214 --> 17:30.632
No.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.468
{\an3}I mean, I don't mean to
put you on the spot, but...

17:32.551 --> 17:34.136
a lot of woman
say they feel

17:34.219 --> 17:36.889
{\an3}bad about themselves when they
look at this kind of stuff.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.808
Ah, they're just pictures
in magazines.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.186
Severely airbrushed pictures.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.979
And what about this sex shop
in Beverly Hills?

17:44.062 --> 17:45.230
Do you think it belongs there?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.191
I'm probably
not your target audience.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.442
My parents were hippies,

17:48.525 --> 17:49.943
{\an1}so I was taught
that sex was

17:50.027 --> 17:52.196
a good thing
and a healthy thing.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.991
{\an1}You know, I don't really
have any hang-ups about it.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.534
So it doesn't bother you?

17:57.618 --> 17:58.786
No, not at all.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.872
If places like that help people
express themselves sexually,

18:01.955 --> 18:02.956
I say go for it.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.833
Sex is a beautiful thing,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.043
with or without commitment.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.295
{\an1}You know, Janet,
you and I

18:08.378 --> 18:11.298
{\an1}may have more in common
than we originally thought,

18:11.381 --> 18:12.174
a lot more.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.635
Let's see.
We went to a dance together.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.637
{\an1}Yes.
And I think you dumped me

18:16.720 --> 18:18.680
before the night was over.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.600
Hmm.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.815
{\an3}That was a shock.
Mm.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.819
(romantic music playing,
kissing)

18:40.786 --> 18:42.704
DAVID:
Ah.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.081
What's that?

18:44.164 --> 18:45.040
Oyster oil.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.084
{\an1}I got this at the sex shop
that just opened up.

18:47.167 --> 18:51.880
It's supposed to relax you and
make you a little more mellow.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.550
Um, d-do I seem tense?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.093
No, not at all.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.386
{\an3}Well, you bought something
for tense people.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.221
It makes sense that
you think I'm tense.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.598
{\an1}Val, I just... I just thought
you'd like it, that's all.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.933
Come on.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.561
Come on.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.938
(grunts)
(clears throat)

19:08.021 --> 19:10.065
Here we go.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.531
{\an3}Mmm.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.741
How's that?
Isn't that nice, hmm?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.578
Yeah, that feels good.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.371
Uh...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.751
{\an1}(sighs)
What the hell is that?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.836
Just trust me, okay?

19:32.838 --> 19:35.465
Anything else under that bed
I should be worried about?

19:35.549 --> 19:38.260
Nope.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.639
(grunting)

19:52.232 --> 19:54.484
What do you think
of my editorial?

19:54.568 --> 19:57.070
{\an3}So you had the
perfect opportunity

19:57.154 --> 19:59.740
{\an3}to take a stand on
pornography, and you didn't.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.284
{\an1}You know, Kel,
once you start telling people

20:02.367 --> 20:04.494
{\an1}where they can shop
or what they can sell,

20:04.578 --> 20:06.121
{\an1}you're getting
on a pretty slippery slope.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.414
Before you know it,
you're legislating

20:07.497 --> 20:08.415
what people can say and do.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.292
Politics, shmolitics, Brandon.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.961
{\an3}You think it's okay
to read these magazines.

20:13.045 --> 20:13.962
{\an3}Those centerfolds
aren't real.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.088
I never said they were.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.590
Well, they aren't.
Fine.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.133
{\an1}They're not.
Are you happy now?

20:18.216 --> 20:19.635
{\an3}Are you saying that
because you agree with me

20:19.718 --> 20:21.303
or because you want to
avoid another argument?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.263
{\an1}You know, Kel,
maybe I'm saying it

20:23.347 --> 20:25.766
because I'm tired
of having my temperature taken

20:25.849 --> 20:27.517
on the subject
every ten minutes.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.186
What about ethics,
what about morals?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.230
(sighs)

20:31.313 --> 20:33.690
Kel, sometimes I like
to go to a movie

20:33.774 --> 20:36.151
or read a magazine
and not think too much.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.196
I don't think that's a crime,
but apparently you do.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.663
Well?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.498
{\an3}You know, I think the straps
are slightly uneven.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.791
{\an3}Let me get tape
to make sure.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.334
Okay.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.849
What are you doing?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.851
I was just looking
for measuring tape.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.437
{\an3}Ricki's straps are uneven.
Oh.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.732
Here you go.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.775
{\an3}Thanks.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.697
{\an3}Monica, I know what
you're doing to yourself.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.073
I'd like to help you.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.241
{\an1}I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.242
{\an3}Your arm,
the cutting.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.493
I saw your things.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.494
I saw the knife.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.412
I told you I have a cat.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.206
{\an1}She's a kitten,
they scratch, end of story.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.041
Those aren't cat marks.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.211
Were you snooping
through my stuff?

21:36.294 --> 21:37.754
I just-- I want to help you.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.047
There's people
that you can talk to.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.716
Look, you have no right
to go through my kit.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.800
It's private.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.510
How would you feel
if I went through your stuff?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.262
{\an4}I wouldn't...
Look,
I feel really violated

21:45.345 --> 21:46.054
right now.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.556
I didn't think
you were like that.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.057
I thought you had more respect.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.768
I do, I'm...

21:51.852 --> 21:52.602
I'm sorry.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.354
I was wrong
not to ask you first.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.856
Yes, you were!

21:58.150 --> 22:00.986
Joe needs me
to set up the next shot.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.585
{\an4}Hey.
DAVID:
Hey.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.753
Where you going?

22:17.836 --> 22:19.046
Oh.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.339
I wanted to get
an early start.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.259
Edible underwear.

22:24.342 --> 22:26.887
Interesting.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.264
What do you say you try them on,
see how they fit?

22:29.347 --> 22:31.433
Uh, can I take a rain check?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.935
{\an3}I've got a lot
to do today.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.562
Hey, what do you say
we grab some breakfast?

22:35.645 --> 22:37.105
I got some new tea.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.940
Jamaican Morning.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.734
I really should go.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.945
I, um... I've got inventory
at the... at the club,

22:44.029 --> 22:45.072
and I got to see bands.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.782
Sounds like a busy day.

22:47.824 --> 22:48.742
Yeah.

22:48.825 --> 22:49.826
Um, what about you?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.537
Just working on jingles,
you know.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.458
Well... I'll see you later.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.335
{\an1}Bye.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.133
(sighs)

23:05.217 --> 23:07.219
(camera shutter clicking)

23:07.302 --> 23:09.096
Nice, very nice.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.138
Beautiful.

23:10.222 --> 23:10.972
You look fantastic.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.474
Your eyes are just
coming out at me.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.350
You look gorgeous.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.227
DONNA: Joe, wait.
Hang on a second.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.270
Let me just fix the dress--
it's not laying right here.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.605
Sure.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.982
So, Ricki, you like reggae?
Sure.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.192
JOE: Great. Well,
there's a concert

23:22.275 --> 23:23.276
tonight at the After Dark

23:23.360 --> 23:24.152
if you'd like to go with me.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.320
{\an3}Cool.
Great.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.530
We can just leave from here,

23:26.613 --> 23:28.448
maybe grab some dinner.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.408
Okay.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.451
You're all set.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.702
{\an3}All right,
let's set up

23:32.786 --> 23:33.954
{\an3}for the next
shot, huh?

23:34.037 --> 23:35.455
Careful.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.500
Hey.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.043
{\an3}Joe doesn't know
what he's missing.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.336
Mm, that's okay.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.005
{\an1}They probably have
some special connection.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.258
{\an1}Chemistry.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.218
{\an1}You know, I'd give anything
to be like her.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.178
Beautiful, successful.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.472
{\an1}I bet her biggest problem
is trying to figure out

23:52.556 --> 23:54.141
{\an1}what to wear
in the morning.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.184
No one's life is perfect.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.519
Yeah, it must be pretty lousy

23:57.602 --> 24:00.313
{\an1}when a guy like Joe
asks you out.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.524
Monica, you are smart

24:02.607 --> 24:03.650
and talented.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.026
You have a great look.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.236
(slight chuckle)

24:06.319 --> 24:08.697
Score one for inner beauty.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.282
Just 'cause Joe blew it

24:10.365 --> 24:11.616
doesn't mean you
should give up.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.410
Or hurt yourself.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.050
Hey. What's up, man?

24:29.134 --> 24:31.052
{\an3}I, uh, came to drop
off a credit card

24:31.136 --> 24:33.221
that Valerie left at
my place last night.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.264
{\an1}Cool.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.056
Where you been?

24:35.140 --> 24:39.019
{\an1}Well, I've just been,
uh, shopping.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.729
{\an3}I think it's
called browsing

24:40.812 --> 24:42.063
{\an3}when you don't actually
buy anything.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.524
{\an1}Yeah, well, I just didn't
find anything I liked.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.818
What were you looking for?

24:46.902 --> 24:47.944
Oh, just...

24:48.028 --> 24:49.863
looking for stuff.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.573
{\an3}(laughing):
Like what, like socks

24:51.656 --> 24:53.533
{\an5}or underwear or, like...
Things like...
stuff and...

24:53.617 --> 24:54.618
slippers or a T-shirt?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.036
All right already!

24:56.119 --> 24:58.747
I went back to Guilty Pleasures.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.207
Satisfied?

25:01.833 --> 25:04.044
{\an3}Obviously a lot more
than you are.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.047
Ouch.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.215
I feel like a jerk.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.257
Steve, why?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.426
We were all in there together
a couple days ago.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.762
Yeah... I know.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.265
But... I went back.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.433
Alone. (chuckles)

25:18.516 --> 25:20.101
And the problem is...?

25:20.185 --> 25:22.854
I think the problem is,
if you boil it down...

25:24.147 --> 25:26.233
I think the problem is,
I don't have a girlfriend.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.317
No, you don't.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.486
Not this very minute, Steve.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.113
You know, places like that,
they...

25:32.197 --> 25:33.240
they kind of split the world

25:33.323 --> 25:34.950
into two different kind
of people.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.743
{\an1}Notice,
you got your...

25:36.826 --> 25:40.080
{\an1}your couples, and then,
for the most part,

25:40.163 --> 25:41.581
guys...

25:41.665 --> 25:43.583
like me,

25:43.667 --> 25:46.294
who have nothing better to do
on a Tuesday night

25:46.378 --> 25:48.338
other than to troll the aisles.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.132
Alone.
Exactly.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.176
{\an3}Steve, you only look
at it that way

25:53.260 --> 25:55.136
because you're not in
a relationship, okay?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.931
{\an3}If you were in a relationship,
you wouldn't be going

25:58.014 --> 25:59.516
{\an3}to a place like Guilty
Pleasures for fun.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.101
You'd be going for work.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.102
I'll take a relationship

26:02.185 --> 26:04.604
over being unemployed any day.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.065
{\an3}Well, obviously, you've never
had Valerie as a boss.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.277
Still, you get into a fight...

26:10.360 --> 26:11.945
you get to make up.

26:12.028 --> 26:16.449
And makeup sex is some of the
most righteous a guy can have.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.826
I think it's worth
a little trouble.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.578
Yeah, "trouble"
being the operative word.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.749
I'll see you
later, man.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.964
(door opening)

26:32.048 --> 26:33.008
Monica.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.384
Look...

26:34.467 --> 26:36.636
it's not what you think, okay?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.138
I know that you're
cutting yourself.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.223
I don't want to
talk about it.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.142
I just wish I understood why.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.059
(sighs)

26:43.143 --> 26:44.894
Calms we down.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.814
It... makes me feel better.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.240
{\an1}I want to be able
to help you.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.367
{\an1}Will you talk
to me about it?

27:00.618 --> 27:02.203
I was in college.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.913
{\an3}Junior year,
I'd gotten

27:03.997 --> 27:05.665
{\an3}a really bad grade
on a design project,

27:05.749 --> 27:08.001
{\an3}and when I got
back to my room,

27:08.084 --> 27:10.045
there was a letter
under the door from my boyfriend

27:10.128 --> 27:11.880
saying that he didn't want
to see me anymore.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.548
I was a mess.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.216
{\an3}Crying my eyes
out, I...

27:15.300 --> 27:19.512
I went to the bathroom
to, um... to wash my face,

27:19.596 --> 27:21.389
get myself together and, um...

27:23.183 --> 27:26.227
And there was a razor
on the side of the sink.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.231
I don't know why,
but I picked it up.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.734
Were you going
to slit your wrists?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.235
No.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.362
I, um...

27:35.445 --> 27:37.947
I just started running it

27:38.031 --> 27:39.616
across my skin,

27:39.699 --> 27:41.910
{\an3}trying to see how hard
I could push it

27:41.993 --> 27:44.037
before it would actually
break through.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.332
And finally, it did.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.255
Funny thing is,
is that it actually didn't hurt.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.135
Monica, you have to stop
doing this to yourself.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.388
Well, I've tried to stop,

28:01.471 --> 28:02.931
but I can't.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.434
There's doctors,
therapists that you can talk to.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.312
But it's up to you.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.106
You have to want to stop.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.108
And there's going to be
times when all you want

28:13.191 --> 28:14.776
to do is give in.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.736
I know. (sighs)

28:17.821 --> 28:20.490
I... I was addicted
to pain pills.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.158
I know what it's like.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.953
Even if I did stop, it's not
like it would make a difference.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.164
It's not like I would wake up
tomorrow and be a supermodel.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.291
In the long run...

28:30.375 --> 28:32.627
looks, they don't mean anything.

28:32.710 --> 28:34.212
It's how you feel.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.257
You deserve to be happy.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.633
I don't know.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.802
{\an1}You do.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.512
You're worth it.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.605
Oh, hey.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.191
I'm looking
for Brandon.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.484
He wasn't at the paper.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.611
Oh, they, um...
they went to Muntz's

28:58.695 --> 28:59.863
bachelor party.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.656
{\an1}That's where
all the boys are.

29:01.739 --> 29:02.991
They had it during the day

29:03.074 --> 29:04.117
so Muntz's fiancée
wouldn't find out.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.285
I guess she's not a big fan

29:05.368 --> 29:07.162
{\an1}of the ritual.
Me, neither.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.664
They probably bought out
the new sex store.

29:09.747 --> 29:10.999
Yeah.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.168
You know, I guess it's
the hot spot these days.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.836
{\an1}You know,
I told David

29:14.919 --> 29:15.837
that I want more romance,

29:15.920 --> 29:17.964
and then he goes and he buys
all these toys.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.133
{\an1}I mean,

29:20.216 --> 29:22.886
it's not like I'm a prude
or anything,

29:22.969 --> 29:25.054
but, you know, why couldn't we
have gone together?

29:25.138 --> 29:27.015
{\an1}I mean, it would've
made it less...

29:27.098 --> 29:28.892
{\an1}Sleazy?
Yeah.

29:28.975 --> 29:29.976
(sighs in disgust)

29:30.059 --> 29:32.228
What do men want?
Because I, for one, am baffled.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.356
They just don't understand
how that stuff makes us feel.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.817
The toys, the magazines.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.027
Fat, inferior.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.737
{\an3}Completely horrible.
Left out.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.030
Like, we're okay

29:42.113 --> 29:43.698
for their daily lives,
but when it comes

29:43.781 --> 29:46.826
to the fantasy part of things,
we're somehow off-limits.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.703
That's because it's their
fantasy, not ours.

29:48.786 --> 29:51.039
I don't want it
to be mine, either.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.417
I just wish that
we could share it, you know?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.211
Men...

29:56.294 --> 29:58.213
They think we're
the complicated species.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.506
Hmm...

30:03.927 --> 30:05.929
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.223
Oh, man, if Julie finds out
about this,

30:08.306 --> 30:09.390
{\an1}she's going to kill me.
Hey.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.517
{\an1}You told her
you were with me

30:10.600 --> 30:12.227
{\an1}having lunch right?
Yeah.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.230
Well, you're with me,
and here's your lunch.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.064
And here's your dessert.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.482
Face it, Muntz.

30:17.565 --> 30:20.026
{\an1}Face it, guy,
you're nailed. Okay?

30:20.109 --> 30:21.069
Women are impossible.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.071
{\an1}I think you can vouch for me.
Women are impossible.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.280
You're about to sign on

30:24.364 --> 30:26.074
{\an1}to a lifelong sentence,
my friend.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.700
{\an1}Hey, hey--
this is a bachelor party.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.077
{\an6}Thank you.
STRIPPER:
Hey, guys.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.578
Where do I set up?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.247
{\an4}Dance floor
would be great.
Okay.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.915
{\an4}Be with you in a flash.
STEVE:
Oh, that's okay.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.291
We're not going any hair.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.252
(laughs)

30:37.335 --> 30:39.420
{\an1}Okay, they want
something, right?

30:39.504 --> 30:40.755
{\an1}You give it to them,
all of a sudden

30:40.838 --> 30:42.090
{\an1}they want something
completely different.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.133
{\an1}You can't win.
You're always in trouble.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.051
{\an3}Always.
You can't figure out

30:45.134 --> 30:47.262
what you might've done wrong,
but now,

30:47.345 --> 30:49.097
{\an3}you are responsible
for all the sins

30:49.180 --> 30:50.807
of mankind, my friend--
all of them.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.809
{\an5}Save yourself.
Jump out now.
(whistles)

30:52.892 --> 30:53.851
{\an1}STEVE:
No, no, no.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.061
{\an1}Not every woman
is like that.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.229
Janet's not like that.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.272
{\an1}She's way more
of a free spirit.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.065
{\an1}She's got...
Whatever.

30:59.148 --> 31:02.151
{\an1}a really interesting
philosophy of free love.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.736
Isn't she the one you
dumped at the reunion?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.113
{\an3}BRANDON:
Yeah.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.114
(Muntz laughing loudly)

31:06.197 --> 31:07.740
{\an1}Yeah. That's
ancient history.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.534
Something about a woman
scorned, I don't know.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.160
{\an3}BRANDON: Kelly has been
on this kick lately.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.122
She's always on about
pornography objectifies women,

31:14.205 --> 31:16.791
turns them into sex objects.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.376
What's your point?

31:20.211 --> 31:23.464
So, which one of you lucky guys
is the groom?

31:23.548 --> 31:24.757
Please, let it be me.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.175
Boing.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.136
{\an3}BRANDON:
Right here.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.433
(someone whistles)

31:34.559 --> 31:37.061
{\an4}DAVID:
Front row.
There is a God.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.479
Front row.
Thank you, fellas.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.481
{\an3}Thank you!

31:40.565 --> 31:42.567
(partygoer whistling,
sultry music plays)

31:44.068 --> 31:46.154
This is too much.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.614
{\an1}Oh, boy.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.115
{\an3}DAVID:
Oh, yeah.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.450
{\an6}DAVID:
Give it to her, Muntzy.
Give it to her!

31:50.533 --> 31:52.368
{\an3}NOAH:
Come on, Muntz! (laughs)

31:53.369 --> 31:54.245
{\an3}Whoo!

31:58.291 --> 31:59.751
{\an3}I was thinking
maybe I should go

31:59.834 --> 32:02.170
and chat up our stripper.
(sputters)

32:02.253 --> 32:03.504
{\an6}BRANDON:
Kind of find out
who she is.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.798
{\an3}What her dreams,
what her aspirations are.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.842
{\an3}Find out what she
does when she's

32:07.925 --> 32:10.136
{\an3}not taking her clothes
off for people.

32:10.219 --> 32:13.139
You know, treat her like
a person, not an object.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.975
{\an1}You mean have
a conversation with her?

32:16.059 --> 32:17.226
Exactly.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.187
{\an6}PARTYGOERS:
Oh, come on!
Yeah! Oh!

32:19.270 --> 32:20.188
NOAH:
Muntzy, come on!

32:20.271 --> 32:21.689
Maybe not.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.608
{\an3}Maybe not.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.819
{\an3}STEVE: Yeah!
(laughing)

32:26.903 --> 32:28.488
{\an3}(laughter)

32:28.571 --> 32:30.198
{\an3}(laughing)
(wolf whistle)

32:30.281 --> 32:31.074
Muntz, you owe me.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.743
{\an5}I love it!
(sighs)
(someone whistles)

32:34.744 --> 32:36.454
(knocking on door)

32:39.248 --> 32:40.541
Hey.
Hey.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.918
{\an3}How was
the bachelor party?

32:42.001 --> 32:44.253
{\an1}Fine, fine,
a good time was had by all.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.256
Hmm, why didn't you
tell me about it?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.257
Oh, I don't know.

32:48.341 --> 32:52.136
{\an1}Maybe I got the impression
you wouldn't approve.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.888
{\an3}I don't.
Well, there you go.

32:53.971 --> 32:56.849
I'm sorry if I'm offended
by the idea that

32:56.933 --> 33:00.019
it's a man's last night of fun
before he commits to a woman.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.229
I think it's
a little disrespectful.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.730
It's tradition.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.107
It's a bonding ritual.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.733
It's no different
than a bridal shower.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.902
I've never been
to a bridal shower

33:07.985 --> 33:09.987
where there are X-rated movies
and strippers.

33:11.155 --> 33:12.865
I'm assuming
there was a stripper.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.284
There was some
live entertainment, yes,

33:15.368 --> 33:16.703
but it was harmless.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.371
Not to me.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.582
You know, it occurs to me

33:21.666 --> 33:23.251
when Dylan was getting married,

33:23.334 --> 33:25.586
we all sat around
playing poker

33:25.670 --> 33:28.089
while you ladies went out
to a female strip club.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.298
That was not my idea.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.593
The concept of bachelor
parties isn't my idea.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.637
You know, you have been
like a broken record

33:34.721 --> 33:36.097
the last few days.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.306
I am not responsible

33:37.390 --> 33:40.101
for all of mankind's
attitudes towards women.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.228
I'm not asking you to be.
Then what are you asking?

33:42.311 --> 33:45.314
Brandon, maybe I've been
a little harsh, okay?

33:45.398 --> 33:47.900
But in a typical, ordinary week
in Beverly Hills,

33:47.984 --> 33:51.237
I am running into women getting
unnecessary plastic surgery,

33:51.320 --> 33:54.449
{\an3}children dieting and girls
just out of college

33:54.532 --> 33:55.783
cutting themselves.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.076
I mean, it's just
a little out of control.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.619
I couldn't agree more.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.081
And now, you are giving me
mixed signals, and it upsets me.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.250
I don't even know
what to say to you.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.460
Brandon!

34:05.543 --> 34:07.295
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to you

34:07.378 --> 34:08.588
question my morals.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.130
I just don't know
where you stand.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.966
Yeah, you do;
you just don't agree with it.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.134
That's right.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.304
This conversation's over.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.222
(door opens)

34:19.766 --> 34:21.225
(door closes)

34:32.527 --> 34:34.280
Wow!

34:34.362 --> 34:35.322
Is that new?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.324
Yeah, I-I, um--

34:37.408 --> 34:38.701
I got it today.

34:38.784 --> 34:40.995
Well, uh, gosh, you...

34:41.078 --> 34:43.039
you look great.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.208
Thanks.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.335
Um...

34:49.378 --> 34:51.797
...I also got these.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.177
{\an1}Is this what I
think it is?

34:56.260 --> 34:58.304
{\an3}Yeah, it's called
a love leash.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.723
What's this?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.016
Body glitter.

35:02.099 --> 35:02.683
You're kidding me.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.602
No, it glows in the dark.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.020
Oh, and this--

35:06.103 --> 35:09.440
{\an3}this is, um, well, this is
called a tickle whip.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.151
You're into this stuff?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.277
Well, I am if you are.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.320
{\an1}It's...

35:14.403 --> 35:16.656
It's great.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.366
It-it's, um,

35:18.449 --> 35:19.659
very exotic.

35:19.742 --> 35:20.660
But?

35:22.286 --> 35:25.206
{\an1}Look, Val,
I just, I got--

35:25.289 --> 35:27.375
I have a lot of stuff
I need to do tomorrow,

35:27.458 --> 35:30.294
{\an1}and I need to start
first thing.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.046
So, um, you're saying

35:32.129 --> 35:34.423
that you probably need
a good night's sleep?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.259
Yeah, it'd probably
be a good idea.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.693
(sighs)

35:59.282 --> 36:01.284
(seabirds chirping)

36:04.328 --> 36:05.788
{\an3}Good morning.
Morning.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.790
{\an3}My, you're full
of energy.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.208
{\an1}I'm psyched
about your catalogue.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.210
{\an3}You saw the proofs, right?
Yeah.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.587
Turned out well, didn't they?

36:12.670 --> 36:13.462
A month from now,

36:13.546 --> 36:15.089
20,000 women
will have that catalogue.

36:15.172 --> 36:17.133
That's the problem.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.551
If you're worried
about production,

36:18.634 --> 36:19.927
you don't have to be.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.762
We will definitely keep up
with demands.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.764
No, I'm, uh...

36:23.848 --> 36:26.726
I'm a little concerned about
the message that it's sending.

36:26.809 --> 36:27.602
What, that it's letting

36:27.685 --> 36:29.937
the world know how great
your designs are?

36:30.021 --> 36:31.272
{\an3}Especially if
you're a six-foot

36:31.355 --> 36:32.773
tall model like Ricki.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.775
{\an3}The average American
woman's what,

36:34.859 --> 36:35.776
I don't know, um,

36:35.860 --> 36:37.236
five-foot-three?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.779
She definitely weighs a lot more
than Ricki does.

36:38.863 --> 36:39.947
Yeah, so? She's a model.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.159
So, by using Ricki as the
spokesperson for my designs,

36:43.242 --> 36:46.621
I'm basically saying that
she's the physical ideal.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.081
And that women out there, if
they don't look like she does,

36:49.165 --> 36:50.666
something's wrong with them.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.919
See, I don't compare myself
to other guys in magazines.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.420
They're models.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.422
Yeah, but women are
totally different.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.424
We always compare ourselves.

36:58.507 --> 37:00.426
And now this thing with Monica

37:00.509 --> 37:03.137
is just making me realize
how extreme it can get.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.096
I hear what you're saying,

37:04.180 --> 37:06.223
but don't you think
she's an unusual case?

37:06.307 --> 37:07.266
{\an3}Maybe.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.225
I'm just not sure

37:08.309 --> 37:11.270
I want to promote an unreal
sense of beauty.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.231
And maybe this is my opportunity
to make a difference.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.364
Here we go.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.366
One grande mocha cappuccino

37:23.449 --> 37:26.285
{\an1}with extra chocolate,
because I know you love that.

37:27.286 --> 37:29.997
And a cranberry bagel.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.166
Uh-oh. Where are you sending me
now? Bakersfield?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.334
Nowhere.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.835
I just wanted you to know

37:34.919 --> 37:36.545
{\an1}how appreciated
you are here.

37:37.713 --> 37:39.298
And...?

37:39.382 --> 37:41.550
And I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

37:41.634 --> 37:43.469
and I realized

37:43.552 --> 37:45.179
that I never gave us a chance.

37:45.262 --> 37:47.014
So I was thinking maybe

37:47.098 --> 37:49.475
we should go out again,
see what happens.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.477
No, you were right.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.020
We're not meant to be.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.230
How do you know?

37:54.313 --> 37:56.315
Well, I gave you
a lot of chances.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.859
And none of them panned out.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.194
But I like working here.

38:00.277 --> 38:03.322
So, let's just keep it
professional.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.658
Assuming that you're comfortable
with that?

38:05.741 --> 38:07.201
Yeah. I just asked you out.

38:07.284 --> 38:08.786
How uncomfortable can I be?

38:10.246 --> 38:12.707
Okay, okay, so I'm
a little gun-shy.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.334
But what happened to free love
and sex without commitment?

38:15.418 --> 38:17.044
I'm totally into it.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.089
With the right person.

38:21.173 --> 38:22.717
(sighs)

38:22.800 --> 38:24.719
(door opens, then shuts)

38:24.802 --> 38:26.721
Mm.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.723
Crash and burn, buddy.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.391
{\an1}What'd I do wrong?
Where should I start?

38:30.474 --> 38:32.351
No, seriously, Brandon.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.020
She's a great girl.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.563
{\an1}I can't believe
I blew it.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.356
You'll survive. You always do.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.359
The only bright spot in my
otherwise bleak existence is

38:40.443 --> 38:42.361
that the stripper agreed
to trade her fee

38:42.445 --> 38:43.738
for ad space in <i> The Beat.</i>

38:43.821 --> 38:44.780
So she's free.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.198
{\an3}No, she's not.
New policy.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.283
No more trades.

38:47.366 --> 38:49.493
If someone wants to buy an ad,
they can pay for it.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.578
That way, we stay in control.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.955
That means no more free passes
to the Spice Parade.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.458
You're just gonna have to find
a new way to make friends.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.626
Is this your roundabout way

38:57.710 --> 38:59.712
of saying no more strip ads
in <i> The Beat?</i>

38:59.795 --> 39:02.089
In a perfect world, maybe,

39:02.173 --> 39:03.382
but we got bills to pay.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.268
Glad you made it.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.270
Yeah, but I was surprised
when I got your message.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.563
{\an1}I thought
the shoot was over.

39:17.646 --> 39:18.814
Oh, not exactly.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.816
{\an1}Was there something wrong
with the pictures?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.068
{\an3}We've got
a big problem.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.152
The wrong model.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.448
{\an3}Amy, Evelyn and Kim,
this is Monica.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.241
Hi.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.409
Okay, I don't get it.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.453
Who are these people?

39:32.536 --> 39:33.996
The four of you
are my new models.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.122
I just figured since

39:35.206 --> 39:37.291
real woman are the ones
who'll be buying my dresses,

39:37.375 --> 39:38.959
I should have real women
modeling them.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.127
You didn't have to do this.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.504
I know.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.797
But it's important to me.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.131
Donna, about yesterday...

39:44.215 --> 39:45.132
{\an3}No, no,

39:45.216 --> 39:46.967
I was wrong to pressure you.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.969
No, you were right.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.805
I do have a problem.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.766
Well, admitting it
is the hardest step.

39:53.849 --> 39:54.642
{\an1}I know.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.186
And I really need
to deal with this.

39:57.269 --> 39:59.814
And the fact that I'm so scared
to do it makes me realize

39:59.897 --> 40:02.608
that, uh, getting help
is the right thing to do.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.819
You won't regret it.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.404
Thanks.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.991
(birds chirping)

40:11.075 --> 40:13.619
Ah, it is beautiful
up here.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.621
I can't believe
this is LA.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.623
{\an3}I know, I'm so glad
we got out of the house.

40:17.706 --> 40:21.502
Yeah. It's been kind of a
stressful week, you know?

40:22.711 --> 40:25.131
{\an1}(whistles)
Wow!

40:25.214 --> 40:27.967
David, I-I... I wanted to talk
to you about the other night.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.718
{\an1}You know,
I've been meaning

40:29.802 --> 40:31.303
{\an1}to talk to you
about that, too.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.847
{\an3}It's not that I
had a problem

40:32.930 --> 40:34.849
with you buying all that
stuff at that sex shop.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.308
No... I blew it.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.853
It's just that if you were bored
or unhappy, I...

40:38.936 --> 40:40.855
I kind of wish you would've
talked to me about it

40:40.938 --> 40:42.189
instead of trying to fix it
on your own.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.692
Wait, wait, I'm, I'm fine
with things.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.735
You're the one who's been
reading the magazine articles.

40:46.819 --> 40:47.820
What are you talking about?

40:47.903 --> 40:48.821
The magazine-- the one

40:48.904 --> 40:50.364
with the girl with the yellow
bikini on the

40:50.447 --> 40:52.324
{\an1}front of it.
I was reading my horoscope.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.742
What?

40:53.826 --> 40:54.994
My horoscope.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.037
Aries.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.081
Wait, you didn't think
I was reading that...

40:59.165 --> 41:01.208
"How to jump-start
your sex life."

41:01.292 --> 41:03.085
(laughing):
David, no.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.420
I'm such an idiot.

41:04.503 --> 41:05.421
Is that why you maxed out

41:05.504 --> 41:06.881
your credit card
at the sex shop?

41:06.964 --> 41:10.092
I thought you were, uh, unhappy.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.887
No, I-I... I thought you were.

41:12.970 --> 41:16.056
{\an3}That's why I got all that
lingerie and crap.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.058
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.144
(laughs)

41:25.482 --> 41:30.654
You know, I've... I've always
been a nature lover.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.615
Really?

41:32.698 --> 41:33.949
Me, too.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.251
DAVID:
Hey!

41:50.549 --> 41:53.260
I was thinking, uh...

41:53.344 --> 41:55.721
maybe we could
call a truce.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.431
{\an3}I think that could
be arranged.

41:57.514 --> 41:59.934
I read your new editorial.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.602
{\an1}And...?

42:01.685 --> 42:03.103
I thought it was terrific.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.731
I'm glad you liked it.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.775
{\an3}I liked the part
where you said if people

42:07.858 --> 42:09.193
{\an3}want to put the sex shop
out of business,

42:09.276 --> 42:10.486
they should stop
shopping there.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.947
That's how I feel.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.116
You're still going
to run the sex ads?

42:16.200 --> 42:18.118
We can't afford not to.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.121
Like it or not,
personal ads, club ads--

42:21.205 --> 42:23.290
they're the bread and butter
of our business.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.128
But for the record,

42:28.212 --> 42:31.590
I have a very firm grasp

42:31.674 --> 42:33.175
on the difference
between fantasy and reality.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.760
Oh.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.012
And there's nothing
like the real thing.

42:40.891 --> 42:42.434
Wait right there.

42:52.736 --> 42:53.779
What's this?

42:53.862 --> 42:57.283
{\an3}Just a little something
I picked up at the store.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.993
A Kama Sutra kit?

42:59.076 --> 43:01.787
{\an3}It's got massage oil,
pleasure balm,

43:01.870 --> 43:03.914
{\an3}honey dust...
Hmm.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.125
{\an6}I don't know.
What do you say
we give it a try?

43:06.208 --> 43:08.043
{\an1}I thought you had a problem
with things like this.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.297
{\an3}Um, no, my problem
was with you

43:11.380 --> 43:13.424
experimenting without me.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.301
If this brings us closer,

43:15.384 --> 43:17.011
{\an3}then I am totally
in favor of it.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.471
Honey dust.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.308
{\an1}What does that
taste like?

43:23.225 --> 43:24.059
(smacking lips)

43:24.143 --> 43:25.644
Mmm.
