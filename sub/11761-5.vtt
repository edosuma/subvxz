<i>- Previously on Camelot...</i>
<i>- I'm something new, and</i>
<i>I will establish here,</i>

00:05.486 --> 00:09.273
at Camelot, a new way of ruling,
for you, the people!

00:09.341 --> 00:12.881
The word has spread.
The people are flocking.

00:12.949 --> 00:14.449
It's good.

00:14.516 --> 00:16.254
This... power.

00:16.323 --> 00:20.192
It hurts you. It costs.
Dear God...

00:20.260 --> 00:23.898
I can feel her.
I can feel what she's feeling.

00:23.966 --> 00:26.035
Tell me you have what you want
and I'll stop.

00:26.102 --> 00:29.340
- I'm not a fight you can win.
- Then it's finished.

00:29.408 --> 00:32.009
But if you have this gift,
why deny yourself?

00:32.077 --> 00:33.391
Unless you're scared.

00:33.416 --> 00:35.906
Excalibur, stop!
Give me the sword.

00:36.217 --> 00:38.855
The only place for it is
the bottom of this lake!

00:40.625 --> 00:42.391
No!

00:47.166 --> 00:49.268
I'm sorry...

Excalibur!

02:33.613 --> 02:35.714
No!

02:42.489 --> 02:45.926
- How long has Merlin been gone?
- Four nights since we last saw him.

02:45.993 --> 02:48.395
Do you think he's coming back?

02:48.463 --> 02:51.666
- I don't know.
- He got you that sword.

02:51.734 --> 02:53.668
He wouldn't just desert you
after that.

02:53.735 --> 02:56.404
Can't predict anything
when it comes to Merlin.

02:56.472 --> 02:59.808
Do you think he has a plan?
Really knows what he's doing?

02:59.875 --> 03:03.411
Huh! I hope so.

03:15.623 --> 03:18.425
Maybe we should stop.
Wait till it passes.

03:18.493 --> 03:22.396
Come on. Don't tell me
the king's worried
by a bit of rain.

03:22.464 --> 03:24.398
Camelot's only
a few hours' ride away.

03:24.466 --> 03:27.902
We should keep going. Come on,
I'll race you. Ya!

03:34.710 --> 03:38.046
Ya!
Ya!

03:42.952 --> 03:46.255
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you all right?

03:46.322 --> 03:50.759
Help me! My father,
he's going to kill him!

03:50.827 --> 03:54.062
Where? Show us.

03:54.130 --> 03:56.731
Which way?

03:56.799 --> 03:59.434
- That way.
- Come on. Ya!

03:59.502 --> 04:01.636
Ya! Ya!

04:12.881 --> 04:15.750
Ya!
Come on!

04:15.818 --> 04:18.519
- Over there!
- Come on! Ya!

04:21.591 --> 04:24.359
Ya! Ya!

04:27.864 --> 04:29.865
Take him up!

04:33.169 --> 04:36.038
- Let him go!
- Father!

04:36.105 --> 04:39.975
Let him go!
Your king demands it!

04:40.042 --> 04:43.145
All right, take him down!
Take him down!

04:43.212 --> 04:46.314
- Father!
- Help me get him inside.

04:46.382 --> 04:48.984
- Why? He's a murderer!
- You do as I say!

04:49.051 --> 04:52.187
He's murdered my brother!
He should be hanging from this tree!

04:52.255 --> 04:54.489
We're just taking
what's right here.

04:54.557 --> 04:56.658
You'll take nothing
without word from your king!

04:56.726 --> 04:59.828
- What village is this?
- Exham, Sire.

04:59.896 --> 05:02.731
Well,
this needn't concern you.

05:02.799 --> 05:04.900
We deal
with our own problems.

05:04.968 --> 05:07.836
We don't want
to detain you.

05:07.904 --> 05:11.006
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry.

05:12.976 --> 05:15.511
- How did this start?
- We caught him

05:15.578 --> 05:17.512
over my brother's body with
a rock in his hand and blood

05:17.580 --> 05:20.883
on his face. We all saw it, didn't we, lads?
He's a murderer, Sire.

05:20.950 --> 05:24.586
We just want what's right.
Then we both agree on that.

05:24.654 --> 05:27.222
What's your name?

05:27.290 --> 05:29.924
Katelyn.

05:29.992 --> 05:32.260
Please.

05:32.328 --> 05:35.196
Don't let them do this.

05:40.302 --> 05:42.836
- Who's the head man here?
- My brother, Wade,

05:42.904 --> 05:45.238
the man he killed,
he was head man.

05:45.306 --> 05:48.174
I suppose it falls to me now.
They call me Ewan.

05:50.244 --> 05:52.445
Choose a few men
to accompany you.

05:52.512 --> 05:56.115
- Accompany me? Where?
- Camelot.

05:56.182 --> 05:59.351
You'll present your grievances against this
man once he's fit to talk for himself.

05:59.419 --> 06:02.188
I'm telling you, Sire, we can
deal with this on our own.

06:02.256 --> 06:04.190
And I'm telling you
you don't need to!

06:04.258 --> 06:07.460
You can't dispense justice when
your mind is clouded by revenge!

06:07.528 --> 06:10.464
Of course. When you hear
what happened, you'll come

06:10.532 --> 06:13.000
to the right decision.
Yeah, then choose your men.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.904
We'll hear it all at Camelot
tomorrow morning.

06:15.971 --> 06:19.340
Are you sure about this?
Camelot's shadow only stretches so far.

06:19.408 --> 06:22.377
Then today it stretches
a little further.

06:22.445 --> 06:24.713
Come on.

06:41.897 --> 06:44.499
Still finding it hard
to control?

06:46.401 --> 06:49.771
You do not have the liberty to
walk in on me whenever you please.

06:49.838 --> 06:52.774
Charity doesn't extend
that far.

06:52.842 --> 06:55.777
Is that what it is?
Charity?

06:55.845 --> 06:58.780
I don't need you for anything,
Sybil. Not anymore.

06:58.848 --> 07:00.749
Oh, I think you do.

07:00.816 --> 07:04.420
Look at you here,
surrounded by strangers.

07:04.488 --> 07:07.757
I'm the only one
who truly understands you.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.598
Why Igraine?

07:14.666 --> 07:17.367
Why her, I wonder?

07:17.435 --> 07:20.104
It's very clear.

07:20.172 --> 07:23.240
So I can get into Camelot,
get close to Arthur,

07:23.308 --> 07:25.209
and kill him.

07:25.277 --> 07:27.078
But then what?

07:27.146 --> 07:30.148
And then I take the crown,
which is rightfully mine.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.083
And after that?

07:35.353 --> 07:38.656
As usual, you haven't thought
far enough ahead.

07:38.723 --> 07:40.758
I've done nothing
but think.

07:40.825 --> 07:44.428
No you haven't.
You need friends.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.397
- No I don't.
- Allies.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.632
I tried an alliance.
It failed.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.269
Morgan, without allies
and friends, the throne will be

07:52.337 --> 07:54.905
taken from you
before you even sit in it.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.440
Hm!

07:56.508 --> 08:00.010
You know nothing
about politics.

08:04.816 --> 08:07.384
Nobody knows you,
Morgan.

08:07.452 --> 08:10.420
They all know of Arthur,
but not you.

08:10.488 --> 08:12.423
They know
I'm Uther's daughter.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.092
Uther's daughter,
Arthur's sister--

08:15.159 --> 08:17.093
you can't be defined
by others.

08:17.161 --> 08:20.096
People need to know you
for yourself.

08:20.164 --> 08:22.398
I won't form any more pacts
with warlords.

08:22.465 --> 08:26.635
Not warlords;
merchants; village elders.

08:26.702 --> 08:30.004
Merchants and village elders?

08:30.072 --> 08:31.939
These should be my allies?

08:32.006 --> 08:35.576
They are ordinary
and they are influential.

08:39.481 --> 08:41.549
I travelled here
across the sea,

08:41.616 --> 08:45.620
and all that way,
I listened to the talk.

08:45.688 --> 08:48.456
Nobody talks of you.

08:48.524 --> 08:50.459
Some talk of Arthur.

08:50.526 --> 08:52.962
But most talk
about their fear.

08:53.029 --> 08:56.598
They don't recognize
their country anymore,

08:56.666 --> 08:58.534
and it frightens them.

09:00.470 --> 09:03.840
There is nothing more powerful
than fear.

09:03.907 --> 09:08.478
You remember what it's like
to be frightened.

09:08.545 --> 09:12.815
And when someone comes,
takes that fear away,

09:12.883 --> 09:14.918
how you love them
for it.

09:14.985 --> 09:17.319
How you worship them.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.955
So you will
make new friends.

09:20.023 --> 09:23.993
And then all the talk will be
of the Lady Morgan.

09:24.060 --> 09:27.430
How she understands
the suffering of the people,

09:27.497 --> 09:30.099
how she is their friend,

09:30.167 --> 09:32.101
and how
she has been robbed

09:32.169 --> 09:34.670
of her legitimate claim
to the crown.

09:38.642 --> 09:41.076
They won't see
that I share their suffering;

09:41.144 --> 09:43.078
they'll see me
as Arthur's lackey,

09:43.146 --> 09:45.147
sniffing out traitors.

09:45.215 --> 09:47.249
You'll be welcoming
and gracious,

09:47.317 --> 09:49.585
and the rest will take care
of itself.

09:49.653 --> 09:51.520
They'll be here soon.

09:51.588 --> 09:53.856
What do you mean?

09:53.924 --> 09:56.626
I had invitations sent out
last night.

09:56.694 --> 09:59.429
You're giving quite a feast
in their honour.

09:59.496 --> 10:06.502
The Lady Morgan's hospitality is
bountiful, like her charity.

10:06.570 --> 10:09.305
You're giving
far too many orders.

10:09.372 --> 10:11.874
Indulge me
just this once.

10:11.942 --> 10:15.543
If it fails,
turn me out.

10:15.611 --> 10:17.679
Wear this one.

10:33.964 --> 10:37.867
Not again.

10:37.934 --> 10:39.601
Away.

10:44.307 --> 10:46.407
More people.

10:46.475 --> 10:48.543
Where are they supposed
to sleep?

10:48.611 --> 10:50.578
Who's organizing this?

10:50.645 --> 10:54.247
Good question.
What do you reckon, goat?

10:54.315 --> 10:58.252
Your goat was in my chambers again.
That's the second time this week.

10:58.319 --> 11:02.089
- Sorry, My Lady.
- Keep your goat under control.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.752
Merlin?

12:08.558 --> 12:12.461
No!

12:14.564 --> 12:16.898
Not now.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.938
Not a good time right now.

12:25.343 --> 12:28.946
Leave me alone.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.024
How are we going
to judge this?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.093
Meet me in the hall with Gawain,
Ulfius, Brastias, and Leontes.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.030
I'll explain how it'll work.
I wish Merlin were here.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.467
You're the marshal.
I'm the king. We don't need him.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.304
I know what we do.
Fetch the men.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.141
- Your Highness.
- Guinevere.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.176
You might have noticed
there's a problem.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.945
Every day more people come,
which is good,

13:01.013 --> 13:04.449
but we're still living like
it's temporary, which it isn't.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.753
We're here to stay, right?
Right. So?

13:07.820 --> 13:09.521
Well, there's no order.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.291
How do we feed people?
Where do they sleep?

13:12.359 --> 13:15.761
Everybody here needs something, but
they can also offer something.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.331
I'm going to make everything
more organized.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.999
Unless you object.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.635
I don't object.
You have my blessing.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.742
Uther's murder...

13:30.810 --> 13:33.879
...robbed the country
of its king.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.582
The old certainties are gone.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.385
A new beginning is being forged.

13:41.689 --> 13:44.057
And while everything is
changing,

13:44.125 --> 13:47.027
in such flux,
it's... it's easy

13:47.095 --> 13:50.631
to feel...
overlooked.

13:52.568 --> 13:55.103
I don't want you to think
that you're being forgotten.

13:55.171 --> 13:58.339
I would like
to prove myself a friend,

13:58.407 --> 14:01.342
and assure you
that any fears

14:01.410 --> 14:03.544
or questions
you may have

14:03.612 --> 14:06.580
can be safely shared
with me.

14:08.649 --> 14:12.586
Now, Lord,
we need to speak the truth, now!

14:17.425 --> 14:19.325
We are all grateful
to the king's sister

14:19.393 --> 14:22.896
for her grace and kindness.
But I speak for us all

14:22.963 --> 14:26.800
when I say we are truly content
and rejoice in Arthur's rule.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.402
As do I.

14:35.243 --> 14:38.412
Tribunals for justice
here at Camelot?

14:38.480 --> 14:41.181
We're at the center
of the realm.

14:41.249 --> 14:43.918
Our values have to spread out
into every community.

14:43.985 --> 14:46.954
These communities already have
their own way of doing things.

14:47.022 --> 14:48.956
We saw their way
of doing things.

14:49.024 --> 14:52.360
He'd have been dead before he
had a chance to defend himself.

14:52.428 --> 14:56.798
So why do you need us?
Surely a king sits alone in matters of judgment.

14:56.866 --> 15:00.568
And anyway, who are we to judge?
We will kill plenty.

15:00.636 --> 15:04.138
The purpose of the tribunal is
to discover the cause.

15:04.206 --> 15:06.274
Aristotle's seven causes:

15:06.342 --> 15:11.379
chance, nature, compulsion, habit,
reason, passion, and desire.

15:11.447 --> 15:13.581
You said the killer was seen
delivering the blow.

15:13.649 --> 15:16.050
What does cause matter
if that was the case?

15:16.117 --> 15:17.718
Cause is everything.

15:17.785 --> 15:20.687
We don't know who attacked who,
who acted in self-defence.

15:20.755 --> 15:23.691
If we discover the cause of the
fight, we'll reason the truth.

15:23.758 --> 15:27.895
We'll discuss what we've heard and decide,
innocent or guilty, together as one.

15:27.962 --> 15:30.229
And what about punishment?
To be decided by all of us?

15:30.297 --> 15:33.366
No, that burden shall be mine
alone.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.072
Surrender your blades.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.640
All of you.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.642
Your sword.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.480
- We don't want any trouble.
- Then you won't need the dagger.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.623
You stay silent in there.
Understand?

16:01.396 --> 16:05.432
Colfur, stand, please.
Katelyn, take a seat.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.235
Sire, really, we don't want
to waste your time like this.

16:08.303 --> 16:10.237
We know how to deal
with our own affairs.

16:10.305 --> 16:12.239
We're embarrassed
to have your eyes on us

16:12.307 --> 16:14.241
when there must be so much else
you could be doing.

16:14.309 --> 16:17.811
You don't need to be embarrassed.
This is what we're here to do.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.718
The purpose of this hearing is
to address the murder

16:25.786 --> 16:29.456
of Exham's head man, Wade, and
decide upon a suitable punishment

16:29.523 --> 16:32.659
for the man who was seen
to attack him, Colfur.

16:34.629 --> 16:37.431
Today is our first hearing
in Camelot.

16:37.499 --> 16:39.733
I'm sure
there'll be many more.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.235
As you king,

16:41.303 --> 16:44.138
it is my intention
to apply the justice

16:44.206 --> 16:47.408
throughout the realm
that begins here today.

16:50.980 --> 16:53.414
Ewan, you speak first.

16:53.482 --> 16:56.117
Tell us about your village
and your brother, Wade.

16:56.185 --> 16:59.087
Well, I don't know
where to begin.

16:59.155 --> 17:01.757
My brother was
a good man.

17:01.824 --> 17:04.126
Our village is quiet.

17:04.194 --> 17:06.429
We never had any trouble
till the likes of him

17:06.497 --> 17:08.364
came along.

17:08.432 --> 17:10.133
And why is that?

17:10.201 --> 17:12.536
Well, he's a naysayer,
isn't he?

17:12.603 --> 17:15.070
Always complaining
about something.

17:15.138 --> 17:17.574
Trying to band people together,
cause trouble.

17:17.642 --> 17:21.109
What do you have to say
to that?

17:21.178 --> 17:23.112
I don't guard my words.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.781
Them that like it, like it.
Them that don't, don't.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.285
Why did the fight start?

17:30.353 --> 17:33.522
All that matters is how it finished,
and Wade got what was coming to him.

17:33.590 --> 17:36.691
But if you're asking who landed
the first blow, it was me.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.994
Why did Wade come to see you
in the first place?

17:39.062 --> 17:43.031
He rented land from my brother.
He owed him tithes.

17:43.099 --> 17:46.134
Well, he hadn't seen hide
nor hair of payment in months.

17:46.202 --> 17:48.436
Is that why Wade was there?
To collect his tithes?

17:52.675 --> 17:55.010
If he was,
I wasn't of a mind to pay him.

17:55.078 --> 17:58.281
You were on his land;
you should pay him.

17:58.348 --> 18:01.851
He can have the steam off my shite
before I give him anything!

18:01.919 --> 18:03.352
You see?

18:03.420 --> 18:06.255
My brother could have thrown him
off that land

18:06.323 --> 18:08.557
a year past.
He had a mind to.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.560
He was too soft.

18:12.496 --> 18:14.364
Well, look where it got him.

18:49.666 --> 18:52.868
Before you open your mouth,
I'm not interested.

18:52.936 --> 18:54.937
Past saving.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.540
I'm not here
to save you.

19:04.281 --> 19:06.216
What do I call you?

19:06.283 --> 19:09.519
Tomal. You?

19:11.588 --> 19:13.556
Am I right in thinking

19:13.623 --> 19:16.058
you're a mercenary?

19:16.126 --> 19:17.693
Yes.

19:19.863 --> 19:21.931
Are you a good one?

19:24.668 --> 19:28.371
I'm still alive.

19:28.439 --> 19:33.076
Who do you want killed?
I don't want anyone killed.

19:33.144 --> 19:34.444
What, then?

19:34.512 --> 19:38.982
The sort of attack
that leaves marks and blood.

19:39.050 --> 19:42.519
- Easy. But why?
- What, do you care?

19:42.586 --> 19:45.321
No.

19:45.389 --> 19:48.591
Then we understand
each other.

19:48.658 --> 19:52.161
What's happening
to this world?

19:52.228 --> 19:54.162
It's goin' to hell.

19:54.230 --> 19:56.231
God will deliver us.

19:56.299 --> 19:58.099
I doubt it.

19:58.167 --> 20:02.070
But tell me
who you want beaten.

20:02.138 --> 20:04.440
Me.

20:13.284 --> 20:14.552
Food.

20:14.619 --> 20:16.754
What are you doing?

20:19.357 --> 20:21.324
I needed a room.
Didn't have a room.

20:21.392 --> 20:23.860
Ahh.
Too much noise everywhere else.

20:23.928 --> 20:27.897
Ohh!
Noise and people.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.800
Is this all you?

20:31.868 --> 20:33.768
Needed to think.

20:33.836 --> 20:36.737
Haven't had time
to think lately.

20:36.805 --> 20:39.840
You're shaking.

20:39.908 --> 20:41.475
Merlin, you're sweating.

20:41.543 --> 20:44.645
That always happens
afterwards.

20:44.713 --> 20:47.281
After what?

20:47.349 --> 20:49.450
After what?

20:51.753 --> 20:55.255
How did you get
those injuries?

20:55.323 --> 20:57.657
I asked for him.

20:57.725 --> 21:02.996
- Merlin, you're not making any sense.
- Wizards don't need to.

21:03.063 --> 21:07.032
Arthur's in the great hall,
holding a trial.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.968
Ohhh!
What's he doing that for?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.936
This is what I mean.

21:12.004 --> 21:16.007
Plan all you like,
but people... Ha ha!

21:16.074 --> 21:18.909
Yes,
they get in the way.

21:20.879 --> 21:24.016
Come outside.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.753
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.289
Too much to do.

21:30.356 --> 21:33.492
Merlin,
Arthur needs you!

21:33.560 --> 21:35.895
He needs you!

21:41.134 --> 21:42.802
Well, Sire,

21:42.869 --> 21:45.237
you've heard everything
you need to hear.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.808
Colfur admits he started
the fight, and we all saw him

21:48.875 --> 21:50.809
kill Wade.
There's no dispute here.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.045
We need to understand the
reason to decide the punishment.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.980
What's reason got
to do with any of this?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.848
Respect the king
and you'll get your justice.

21:56.916 --> 22:01.220
Did the fight start because you
refused to pay Wade his tithe?

22:03.357 --> 22:05.291
- Answer the king!
- Why?

22:05.359 --> 22:08.295
- I'm trying to understand.
- He came to me, we fought,

22:08.363 --> 22:10.964
I smashed his head in with
a rock. That's the fact of it.

22:11.032 --> 22:12.833
Would you rather be executed
than talk?

22:12.900 --> 22:15.736
You think
talking will make a difference?

22:15.803 --> 22:18.572
You're just using me here
to test your justice.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.241
Are you going to stand guard
when all this is over? No!

22:21.309 --> 22:23.010
So no point in talking!

22:23.077 --> 22:25.245
Sire, what difference does
any of this make?

22:25.313 --> 22:27.781
My brother's dead,
and he deserves the same fate!

22:27.849 --> 22:32.052
Silence!

22:34.756 --> 22:36.424
We need a break.

22:36.491 --> 22:39.260
Go get some food.

22:41.430 --> 22:45.066
It's murder.
An eye for an eye.

22:47.003 --> 22:49.538
- Gawain?
- He couldn't pay his tithe,

22:49.605 --> 22:52.207
so he killed the head man.
It's execution.

22:52.275 --> 22:54.510
You know,
Colfur didn't admit that.

22:54.578 --> 22:58.147
He said IF Wade was there for that, he
wouldn't have been of a mind to pay him.

22:58.215 --> 23:00.983
- Same thing.
- It's not.

23:01.051 --> 23:03.552
When you asked him again,
he didn't respond.

23:05.588 --> 23:08.456
What if Wade was there
for something else?

23:08.524 --> 23:11.760
Arthur, this is becoming a distraction.
We have plenty we need to do.

23:11.827 --> 23:15.664
Execute Colfur, and let's get back to work.
You'll still be seen as a strong leader.

23:15.731 --> 23:18.166
Why did she run?

23:18.234 --> 23:20.301
When we first saw her?

23:20.369 --> 23:22.504
She was running
for help.

23:22.571 --> 23:24.439
No.

23:24.507 --> 23:26.441
She was running away.

23:26.509 --> 23:28.743
Her father was being
attacked.

23:28.811 --> 23:31.246
Why didn't she go
to any of the other villages?

23:31.313 --> 23:33.481
When you asked Colfur
why Wade was there,

23:33.549 --> 23:36.518
there was this look
between Colfur and Katelyn.

23:36.586 --> 23:39.455
It was like he wanted
to be sure she wouldn't speak.

23:44.361 --> 23:46.763
- Morgan!
- Oh, my Lord!

23:46.831 --> 23:48.832
Sibyl.

23:50.669 --> 23:53.838
- She was found in the woods.
- Get away from her.

24:02.548 --> 24:04.682
Let's get her
to her bed.

24:04.750 --> 24:07.418
No, my chamber.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.927
The holy mother beaten--

24:17.995 --> 24:20.030
none of us are safe.

24:31.778 --> 24:34.814
Run,
fetch water and cloths!

24:44.624 --> 24:47.093
They see...

24:47.160 --> 24:51.063
...that you suffer
with them.

24:51.131 --> 24:56.468
Now tell me I know nothing
about politics.

24:58.404 --> 25:01.773
Don't waste the moment,
child.

25:01.841 --> 25:04.310
Use it.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.479
Go.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.450
Go.

25:19.861 --> 25:21.928
I need help.

25:21.996 --> 25:23.997
You want a woman's touch?

25:24.064 --> 25:27.334
Mm.

25:27.402 --> 25:31.838
She ran instead of getting help.
It doesn't make sense.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.407
I have to be sure.

25:34.474 --> 25:37.376
I can't sentence a man to death
unless I'm sure.

25:37.444 --> 25:39.545
He killed another man.

25:39.612 --> 25:42.548
Why does sentencing him
bother you so much?

25:42.616 --> 25:45.919
Because I want our justice to be
better than what's gone before.

25:45.986 --> 25:48.255
And because I think
that sometimes maybe people do

25:48.322 --> 25:50.557
the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.701
It is beautiful.

26:00.769 --> 26:04.404
I sometimes come here
to think.

26:04.472 --> 26:07.707
I've never seen the sea
before.

26:11.679 --> 26:13.980
Arthur's a good man.

26:14.048 --> 26:16.449
He listens to the people.

26:16.517 --> 26:18.284
He really cares.

26:18.352 --> 26:21.687
He can't help me.
No one can.

26:21.755 --> 26:24.591
It's my fault.

26:24.658 --> 26:28.094
- Why?
- I ran.

26:28.161 --> 26:30.095
My father told me to.

26:30.163 --> 26:32.964
We knew Wade was coming.

26:33.032 --> 26:35.934
What was he coming for?

26:38.804 --> 26:42.740
The head man takes every girl
as she becomes a woman.

26:42.808 --> 26:46.144
- No!
- It's the way.

26:46.212 --> 26:48.480
Do people not try
and stop this?

26:48.547 --> 26:51.950
You don't stand against Wade
and Ewan's kin.

27:04.264 --> 27:06.332
Igraine was right.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.205
Yes, this is why. Heh...
She finds out, and now it's

27:13.273 --> 27:16.542
an endless stream of visitors
just when I'm trying to think.

27:18.445 --> 27:22.581
- Who else has been here?
- Hmm? That's not the point.

27:22.649 --> 27:25.885
Huh...
You mean just me?

27:25.953 --> 27:30.589
An endless stream of me?
Hm!

27:32.526 --> 27:36.028
- What is it you want?
- You were here all alone.

27:36.096 --> 27:37.997
I needed some time.

27:38.064 --> 27:40.365
What is this?

27:40.433 --> 27:43.202
I wanted
to lay it all out.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.906
What does it all mean?

27:47.973 --> 27:51.042
Oh, that just shows
the first wave is...

27:51.109 --> 27:53.010
...ostensibly complete.

27:53.078 --> 27:56.346
But we've fallen behind.
There's so much more to do.

27:56.414 --> 27:58.048
The library.

28:01.486 --> 28:04.255
What do you mean,
"first wave"?

28:04.323 --> 28:08.827
Well, getting you here-- occupying
Camelot, recruiting people.

28:08.895 --> 28:12.532
How's your trial?
Will you come?

28:12.600 --> 28:16.270
- No. - Why?
- You had the big idea.

28:16.337 --> 28:20.908
See it through.
I will. - Good.

28:24.178 --> 28:27.114
I'll be fine
soon.

28:27.181 --> 28:29.250
I just needed...

28:32.520 --> 28:34.554
...this.

28:38.526 --> 28:40.093
I'll be watching.

28:48.036 --> 28:51.072
♪

28:56.479 --> 28:58.847
Yet another ambush.
This is a serious--

28:58.915 --> 29:01.850
...travel about without
protection. Tell the women--

29:01.918 --> 29:04.018
Lady Morgan.

29:10.191 --> 29:12.626
- I must apologize.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

29:12.694 --> 29:16.229
Not at all. How is she?
She's being attended.

29:18.666 --> 29:23.237
You'll have to forgive me.
She's been a mother to me since I was a little girl.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.907
How can this happen?
Please.

29:26.975 --> 29:29.511
Drink.
Thank you.

29:33.350 --> 29:36.886
Her horse was carrying
the Pendragon symbol.

29:38.823 --> 29:41.057
She was wearing
our colours?

29:41.124 --> 29:43.493
But... but
this is our protection.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.495
I fly this banner
along my trading routes.

29:46.563 --> 29:48.530
It's still attacked.

29:48.598 --> 29:50.399
The banner is flown
over my village,

29:50.467 --> 29:52.601
and yet
our grain stores are robbed,

29:52.668 --> 29:54.969
our young women are taken.

29:55.037 --> 29:57.572
There's no control.
None at all.

29:57.639 --> 30:00.141
We are all loyal subjects.

30:00.209 --> 30:02.777
Well, this...
this...

30:02.845 --> 30:04.780
...this is not protection.

30:04.847 --> 30:07.249
We understand
he is your brother.

30:07.317 --> 30:10.954
But the land moves
further into chaos

30:11.022 --> 30:12.923
every day.

30:12.991 --> 30:15.026
And that is
the real truth.

30:16.962 --> 30:20.232
I will not
let this happen.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.168
I will not!

30:23.236 --> 30:25.938
Are there others
who feel betrayed?

30:26.005 --> 30:28.775
- Yes. Ay.
- Yes, there are others.

30:28.842 --> 30:31.611
I will send a messenger

30:31.679 --> 30:34.448
to my brother
to represent all of us.

30:34.516 --> 30:36.416
When he knows of this,
he will act.

30:36.484 --> 30:39.820
I know he will want to make
redress. Have faith in him.

30:39.887 --> 30:41.822
In the meantime,

30:41.890 --> 30:44.525
send word to others
who feel this way.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.227
Tell them to come
to Castle Pendragon tonight.

30:47.296 --> 30:51.366
Tell them the king will come
to his sister's call.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.275
Shall I send
for the messenger?

31:00.343 --> 31:03.245
Don't bother.

31:03.313 --> 31:05.247
So what are we waiting for?

31:05.315 --> 31:10.421
He should be dead and buried by now.
Go wait with your people.

31:15.094 --> 31:17.696
How does this help?
I got a rock, I smashed it

31:17.763 --> 31:21.400
on his head. I deserve what I get.
The people have to know.

31:21.467 --> 31:24.402
I can spare you; there was justification.
But the people have to know why.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.839
- No. I've told you no.
- If you don't speak about this, it will keep on happening.

31:27.907 --> 31:31.677
- That's not my responsibility.
- Then how does anything ever change?!

31:31.745 --> 31:35.948
- It's not that simple.
- Why?

31:39.419 --> 31:41.353
Go out, Katelyn.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.789
No.

31:43.857 --> 31:47.126
I said go out.
Please.

31:55.702 --> 31:57.637
Wade's family...

31:57.704 --> 32:00.773
...owns all the land
the village is on.

32:00.841 --> 32:03.809
They get the first realm
of every crop.

32:03.877 --> 32:07.913
They plough the first furrow
of every farm come autumn.

32:11.351 --> 32:13.785
The night before my wedding,

32:13.853 --> 32:17.188
Wade and Ewan's father claimed
his tithe.

32:20.859 --> 32:25.462
I was an outsider. I...
I hadn't heard.

32:25.530 --> 32:29.899
Head man was always the first
for every woman.

32:29.967 --> 32:34.670
Katelyn's mother...
told me...

32:34.738 --> 32:37.673
...two days
after we were married.

32:39.576 --> 32:43.246
She died giving birth
to Katelyn.

32:43.313 --> 32:47.016
Katelyn, Wade,
and Ewan are...

32:47.083 --> 32:48.984
...kin.

32:49.052 --> 32:51.020
Wade and Ewan don't care.

32:51.087 --> 32:53.122
Those brothers come
for every girl.

32:53.190 --> 32:56.825
- Then why didn't you leave?
- I did nothing wrong!

32:56.893 --> 33:00.163
You have to speak.
This has to stop!

33:00.230 --> 33:04.768
I can't! Katelyn doesn't know
she's not mine.

33:04.835 --> 33:08.838
If she knew, she...
I'll have lost her!

33:08.906 --> 33:10.574
Oh, look at me,

33:10.641 --> 33:13.577
a grown man,
crying like a baby.

33:15.647 --> 33:18.081
It's not blood
that ties you together;

33:18.149 --> 33:20.550
it's the memories
you share.

33:22.453 --> 33:25.823
Everything you taught her,
everything you gave up for her--

33:25.890 --> 33:30.093
that's your love;
that's what flows through her.

33:30.161 --> 33:34.031
Tell her and you'll see
how much she loves you.

33:37.335 --> 33:40.104
I know.

33:40.172 --> 33:41.939
You think the girls

33:42.007 --> 33:44.409
in the village don't talk
about this?

33:46.479 --> 33:49.781
I've always known.

33:49.849 --> 33:52.051
And...

33:52.118 --> 33:55.021
...I never loved you
any the less.

33:55.089 --> 34:00.027
You... are my father.

34:26.687 --> 34:29.355
Wade had come
for her.

34:29.422 --> 34:32.925
And I told her
to run.

34:32.992 --> 34:35.128
I told her
to forget me

34:35.195 --> 34:38.130
and get away--
as far away as she could.

34:38.199 --> 34:42.235
I told him I'd kill him before
I'd let him near my girl.

34:44.204 --> 34:47.239
That's how
the fight started.

34:52.344 --> 34:54.280
Have you anything to say?

34:54.347 --> 34:56.782
We knew all this.

34:56.850 --> 34:59.185
That's the way we live.

34:59.252 --> 35:03.521
The customs of your village
are no longer acceptable.

35:03.589 --> 35:06.524
The head man works harder
than anyone.

35:06.592 --> 35:08.659
He's entitled
to first fruit,

35:08.727 --> 35:11.662
and no Christian boy king is
ever gonna change that.

35:11.729 --> 35:13.596
It changes today.

35:13.664 --> 35:15.598
Oh, good luck.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.967
Now give your verdict.

35:32.783 --> 35:36.153
Colfur is hereby banished
from the village of Exham.

35:38.924 --> 35:42.827
You may return to collect your belongings.
Then leave the village permanently.

35:42.895 --> 35:45.729
- Thank you.
- Banishment! For murder?

35:45.797 --> 35:49.700
Banishment for murder whilst trying
to protect his daughter's honour.

35:49.768 --> 35:52.269
The hearing is finished.

35:52.337 --> 35:56.107
- Well, that's a shame.
- Why?

35:56.174 --> 35:59.609
'Cause
if that's Camelot justice...

35:59.677 --> 36:02.779
...you'll be a short time
on the throne.

36:38.551 --> 36:40.685
He didn't need me.

36:40.753 --> 36:44.723
Thank you
for checking on him.

36:49.862 --> 36:52.964
There was a girl
and she died.

36:53.032 --> 36:56.101
And it was my fault.

36:58.037 --> 37:02.007
I thought I could control
what I was trying to do.

37:05.612 --> 37:08.481
You keep yourself
too alone.

37:08.549 --> 37:11.418
Why does it bother you?

37:11.486 --> 37:14.054
Because sometimes
I see glimpses

37:14.122 --> 37:17.191
of the man
you might be.

37:26.366 --> 37:29.268
You did all this
for me?

37:29.336 --> 37:33.205
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

37:40.379 --> 37:43.615
You must blaze tonight,
child.

37:43.683 --> 37:46.584
It's all yours
to take.

37:48.487 --> 37:50.889
So blaze.

38:06.671 --> 38:08.605
Take both of them
round to the back!

38:08.673 --> 38:11.407
What they do
to the women...

38:11.475 --> 38:16.078
Do you think it happens
in other villages?

38:16.146 --> 38:18.613
I don't know.

38:18.681 --> 38:20.982
Maybe.

38:21.050 --> 38:23.452
Wherever it is...

38:23.520 --> 38:25.554
...we have to stop it.

38:27.490 --> 38:29.591
We will.

38:34.131 --> 38:36.065
Thank you.

38:36.133 --> 38:39.935
For what you did
with Katelyn.

38:40.003 --> 38:42.771
You're welcome.

38:48.377 --> 38:52.280
- Ouch! Ah!
- Does it hurt?

38:52.347 --> 38:55.916
- I'll be fine.
- Liar.

38:55.984 --> 38:59.920
What on earth did you use
on it before?

38:59.988 --> 39:03.925
- Nothing.
- Well, I hope that sword is worth it.

39:03.993 --> 39:08.163
After the amount of injuries you've
got, it had better become legendary.

39:08.231 --> 39:11.033
Ah, it's a great sword,
but it'll only be...

39:11.101 --> 39:14.738
...legendary if he does
something legendary with it.

39:17.342 --> 39:20.144
Merlin...

39:20.212 --> 39:22.847
Who are you?

39:24.917 --> 39:26.884
How am I supposed
to answer that?

39:26.952 --> 39:31.388
All right, all right.
Who were you before Arthur?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.391
Before Uther?

39:33.459 --> 39:35.893
The same.

39:38.530 --> 39:41.499
- Where were you born?
- Does it matter?

39:41.567 --> 39:44.736
It doesn't matter,
but I'm interested.

39:46.672 --> 39:48.941
You hide.

39:49.008 --> 39:52.678
Even when you're not here,
you hide.

39:52.746 --> 39:55.614
- I don't mean to.
- Yes, you do.

39:57.684 --> 39:59.619
What about you?

39:59.686 --> 40:01.754
You know everything
about me.

40:01.822 --> 40:03.589
Cornwall.

40:03.656 --> 40:05.123
Uther.

40:05.191 --> 40:06.758
Here.

40:06.826 --> 40:08.927
But before Cornwall...

40:08.995 --> 40:11.930
Who were you then?

40:17.536 --> 40:20.772
I was...

40:20.840 --> 40:23.041
...strong.

40:23.109 --> 40:25.911
Opinionated.

40:28.182 --> 40:30.784
Naïve...

40:30.851 --> 40:33.553
...and full of hope.

40:33.621 --> 40:36.657
Living comfortably
in a family with means.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.227
What did you dream of?

40:41.663 --> 40:46.166
I dreamt of a husband
who'd treat me as an equal.

40:46.234 --> 40:48.802
Did you ever find him?

40:51.738 --> 40:53.806
No.

41:04.384 --> 41:06.918
I'm sorry for that.

41:09.322 --> 41:11.656
So am I.

41:21.601 --> 41:25.571
- No!
- What's the matter?

41:25.638 --> 41:27.573
People who get close to me
get burned.

41:27.640 --> 41:31.744
How did you become
such a man?!

41:37.685 --> 41:40.753
- Be generous with the drink.
- Yes, Holy Mother.

41:43.390 --> 41:46.458
Make sure
everyone is well fed.

41:48.394 --> 41:52.563
It's you. You live here
with the king's sister?

41:52.631 --> 41:55.833
No, I don't.
I came for the food.

41:55.901 --> 41:58.068
You were giving orders
to the servants. You live here.

41:58.136 --> 42:01.839
Why does Morgan's nun pay me
to beat the pulp out of her?

42:01.907 --> 42:07.279
I... needed a roof
over my head.

42:07.347 --> 42:10.149
And this...
persuaded them.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.555
Please.
Don't judge me.

42:50.557 --> 42:53.993
- Is this everything?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

42:54.061 --> 42:56.396
You've got a lot
of ground to cover.

43:03.137 --> 43:05.873
Don't make the mistake
of taking me on.

43:05.940 --> 43:09.409
You see,
we have our own justice.

43:09.477 --> 43:13.480
So do I. My mother knew
what it was to be raped.

43:13.547 --> 43:17.250
So I keep a special place
in my heart for people like you.

43:17.318 --> 43:19.019
Your king doesn't rule
around here; I do.

43:19.086 --> 43:21.054
You the more you talk,
the more trouble you're in.

43:21.122 --> 43:24.758
So, Colfur,
is this who you are?

43:24.825 --> 43:29.395
Hiding behind a boy king and his warriors?
Eh, Colfur!

43:29.463 --> 43:31.864
This man has been
banished!

43:31.932 --> 43:34.700
And I'm carrying out
his sentence.

43:34.767 --> 43:37.469
Please don't get
in my way.

43:48.681 --> 43:50.782
We have a problem.

43:56.755 --> 43:59.223
- ...killed my brother.
- This is your last warning!

43:59.291 --> 44:01.426
Go back to your dwellings.

44:01.494 --> 44:04.129
What the matter,
big man?

44:04.197 --> 44:06.565
Are you afraid to fight?

44:17.779 --> 44:20.414
Ah, you'll get
your rightful punishment.

44:20.482 --> 44:22.416
And your girl will get her due.

44:28.556 --> 44:30.957
Him.

44:34.329 --> 44:36.396
This is not a problem.

44:59.623 --> 45:03.092
My people.

45:03.160 --> 45:06.929
I welcome you tonight
to Castle Pendragon.

45:06.996 --> 45:09.497
Where's the king?
Has he come?

45:09.565 --> 45:12.267
I'm sorry to say that he was
too busy to talk to me.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.668
What?

45:14.736 --> 45:16.470
He sent my messenger back

45:16.538 --> 45:19.840
with word that he was too busy
to address our concerns.

45:19.908 --> 45:24.345
- Too... too busy?
- I share your frustration.

45:24.413 --> 45:27.115
I cannot pretend otherwise.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.852
It seems to me now...

45:31.920 --> 45:36.456
...that we stand
on the very brink.

45:36.524 --> 45:38.959
Everything
that was once so secure

45:39.027 --> 45:42.997
under my father's reign is
now under threat.

45:43.065 --> 45:47.335
All of us are in danger.

45:47.403 --> 45:49.537
I am loyal
to my brother,

45:49.605 --> 45:53.508
but I fear the future.
I fear it.

45:53.575 --> 45:58.179
And I ask myself,
what do we mean to the king

45:58.247 --> 46:00.815
if he's too busy
for us?

46:23.606 --> 46:26.007
Finally!

46:39.789 --> 46:43.725
Well, don't just stand there!
Help me!

46:43.793 --> 46:46.061
You were told
Colfur was to be banished!

46:46.128 --> 46:48.897
You think
your words mean anything

46:48.964 --> 46:51.867
here,
in the real world?

46:51.934 --> 46:54.436
You've done nothing here.
Look around you.

46:54.504 --> 46:58.006
This is no longer
your village.

47:00.309 --> 47:03.778
I am not
too busy for you.

47:03.846 --> 47:07.748
I hear your woes
and they grieve me.

47:10.218 --> 47:12.352
But know that tonight,

47:12.420 --> 47:14.621
I make an oath,

47:14.688 --> 47:16.889
a pledge to you all
that I will

47:16.957 --> 47:19.391
protect you
with my life's blood.

47:22.862 --> 47:25.464
Britain needs
a strong leader.

47:25.532 --> 47:27.767
Yes.

47:27.835 --> 47:30.904
Let me prove myself
to you.

47:32.873 --> 47:34.474
You.

47:34.541 --> 47:36.742
Come here.

47:47.655 --> 47:50.089
Is this the man?

47:50.157 --> 47:52.126
Yes.

47:52.193 --> 47:55.462
That is the man
who beat me.

47:55.530 --> 47:58.266
No!

48:04.940 --> 48:07.341
Yes!

48:07.409 --> 48:10.344
I can go anywhere.

48:10.411 --> 48:13.513
I can start again.
You can't stop me.

48:13.581 --> 48:15.949
Move,
and we'll find you.

48:16.017 --> 48:17.984
Run,
and we'll hunt you.

48:18.052 --> 48:21.621
Wherever you are,
Camelot will be your shadow.

48:23.390 --> 48:27.460
You deserve to die

48:27.527 --> 48:29.462
ten times over
for every woman you've harmed.

48:29.529 --> 48:31.797
That's enough, Gawain.

48:31.864 --> 48:37.168
You're not worth the cloth
and oil to clean the blades.

48:41.873 --> 48:45.710
From today, every woman
in this village is protected

48:45.777 --> 48:49.013
by my men,
by my flag.

48:49.081 --> 48:51.616
If harm falls to any woman,
to anybody, they will know.

48:54.954 --> 48:57.990
Exham is now part
of Camelot.

49:17.145 --> 49:22.015
This man is every man
who stole from you.

49:22.083 --> 49:24.584
Every man
who terrorized you.

49:24.652 --> 49:27.420
Who violated your women
and girls,

49:27.488 --> 49:29.389
and brutalized your sons.

49:29.457 --> 49:32.559
This man is every man

49:32.626 --> 49:37.597
who made you feel worthless,
despised, and weak!

49:37.665 --> 49:43.069
This man is every man
who robbed you of your dignity

49:43.137 --> 49:47.408
and made you ashamed to belong
to this once great nation!

49:50.112 --> 49:53.749
I, Morgan,
daughter of Uther...

49:55.719 --> 49:57.653
...give him to you.

50:03.827 --> 50:06.762
Now take your justice!
