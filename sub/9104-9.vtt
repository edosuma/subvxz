<i>&lrm;In the daytime I'm Marinette,</i>

00:04.480 --> 00:06.960
<i>&lrm;just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:10.840
<i>&lrm;but there's something about me</i>
<i>&lrm;that no-one knows yet</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:13.000
<i>&lrm;because I have a secret.</i>

00:13.440 --> 00:15.760

00:34.480 --> 00:37.200
&lrm;-Ready, dad?
&lrm;-As much as I'll ever be.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.480
&lrm;Happy career day, my darlings.

00:43.560 --> 00:44.640
&lrm;[Dad] My day begins

00:44.800 --> 00:48.680
&lrm;at 4 am every morning
&lrm;because the bakery opens at 7.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.160
<i>&lrm;You'd think it's a routine life,</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:53.560
<i>&lrm;making the same pastries, rolls, cakes...</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:54.880
&lrm;but every day's different.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.960
&lrm;One day someone might order
&lrm;an Eiffel Tower cake and the next...

01:00.120 --> 01:02.360
<i>&lrm;You've reached Gabriel Agreste's</i>
<i>&lrm;voicemail.</i>

01:02.520 --> 01:03.760
<i>&lrm;Please leave a message.</i>

01:03.920 --> 01:05.200
&lrm;Hi, father, it's me.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.600
&lrm;It's parents' career day, remember?

01:07.760 --> 01:10.200
&lrm;I was hoping you'd show up.
&lrm;Call me back.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.040
&lrm;-You OK?
&lrm;-Yeah, whatever. Nothing new.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.320
&lrm;[he sighs sadly]

01:22.480 --> 01:24.320
&lrm;[Dad] Marinette will come round

01:24.480 --> 01:26.280
&lrm;to pass out some fresh croissants.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.880
&lrm;Thank you, Mr. Dupain.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.520
&lrm;Now, let's meet Alya's mom.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.240
&lrm;She's head-chef at Le Grand Paris hotel

01:32.400 --> 01:33.840
&lrm;owned by Mayor Bourgeois.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.640
&lrm;[she sighs]

01:36.880 --> 01:38.360
&lrm;It's beautiful.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.760
&lrm;Look, don't touch.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.880
&lrm;[Mayor] Put it away, Chloe.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.440
&lrm;It could get in the wrong hands.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.680
&lrm;How many croissants would your dad
&lrm;have to sell to buy one of these?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.680
&lrm;What am I saying?
&lrm;He'd have to sell the whole store.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.680
&lrm;If you're so rich,
&lrm;you don't need free croissants.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.240
&lrm;[she groans] Jealous.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.440
&lrm;Is that camembert?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.600
&lrm;[he gasps]

02:06.760 --> 02:09.440
&lrm;That's not camembert,
&lrm;but it is very shiny.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.080
&lrm;I like shiny.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.240
&lrm;I have no dishes to share

02:13.400 --> 02:17.200
&lrm;but maybe Mr. Bourgeois will invite you all
&lrm;to the hotel for lunch.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.000
&lrm;[policeman chuckles]

02:20.160 --> 02:21.640
&lrm;[Plagg giggles]

02:23.120 --> 02:25.200
&lrm;[Plagg giggles]

02:26.840 --> 02:27.920
&lrm;[she squeals]

02:28.400 --> 02:29.440
&lrm;[giggling]

02:29.600 --> 02:31.160
&lrm;Do you ever not trip up?

02:32.280 --> 02:33.320
&lrm;[Marinette groans]

02:33.720 --> 02:34.920
&lrm;[Plagg struggles]

02:35.080 --> 02:37.160
&lrm;Next is Sabrina's father, a policeman,

02:37.600 --> 02:39.200
&lrm;Officer Roger.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.480
&lrm;I've been a police officer for 15 years,

02:42.640 --> 02:46.400
&lrm;and I believe that everyone
&lrm;is innocent until proven guilty.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.840
&lrm;My bracelet, it's gone!

02:49.000 --> 02:51.040
&lrm;I had it a second ago.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.920
&lrm;You, you stole it!

02:53.080 --> 02:55.040
&lrm;What are you talking about?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.760
&lrm;You tripped on my bag
&lrm;so you could steal it.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.720
&lrm;You're a policeman, arrest her.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.720
&lrm;[angrily] My daughter is not a thief.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.280
&lrm;Hold on, Miss Bourgeois.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.280
&lrm;We don't accuse without proof.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.080
&lrm;Everyone calm down.
&lrm;Maybe you simply misplaced it.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.160
&lrm;You're calling me a liar?

03:13.320 --> 03:14.320
&lrm;Daddy!

03:14.480 --> 03:16.440
&lrm;Roger, I demand you search this girl.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.680
&lrm;[Chloe chuckles]

03:17.840 --> 03:19.080
&lrm;[teacher] Please, everybody.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.680
&lrm;Need I remind you

03:20.840 --> 03:23.000
&lrm;that as mayor, I am your superior?

03:23.400 --> 03:26.480
&lrm;But it's against the law.
&lrm;I can't just go...

03:26.640 --> 03:28.080
&lrm;OK, then you're fired.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.920
&lrm;Mayor, you can't be serious.
&lrm;Over a missing bracelet?

03:32.080 --> 03:34.320
&lrm;This is my daughter's bracelet.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.240
&lrm;You're incompetent, and you're fired.
&lrm;Get out!

03:37.880 --> 03:39.160
&lrm;[he sighs sadly]

03:39.320 --> 03:40.920
&lrm;[Chloe] Let's call Ladybug.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.720
&lrm;She'll actually do something.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.000
&lrm;[she sighs]

03:48.240 --> 03:51.760
&lrm;Parent-child relationships
&lrm;can be so complicated...

03:51.920 --> 03:55.080
&lrm;and a perfect breeding-ground for stress.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.440
&lrm;When there's no more law and order,
&lrm;there's only chaos left.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.400
&lrm;Fly away, my evil little Akuma,

04:06.560 --> 04:08.680
&lrm;and take control of this policeman.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.399
&lrm;[flapping]

04:18.560 --> 04:22.480
&lrm;He expects me to break the law?
&lrm;That's just... criminal.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.440
&lrm;[whooshing]

04:24.600 --> 04:25.800
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Rogercop,

04:26.200 --> 04:27.760
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.160
&lrm;This city needs a true, ruthless,
&lrm;righter of wrongs

04:31.320 --> 04:33.200
&lrm;and that is where you come in.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.280
&lrm;Yes, sir.

04:37.920 --> 04:42.640
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;must be destroyed if you want retribution.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.840
&lrm;You will seize their Miraculouses for me.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.640
&lrm;Do we have an agreement?

04:49.360 --> 04:50.760
&lrm;[robotic voice] <i>&lrm;Affirmative!</i>

04:50.920 --> 04:53.560
<i>&lrm;Cat Noir and Ladybug</i>
<i>&lrm;will be powerless against me.</i>

04:53.720 --> 04:55.720
<i>&lrm;Justice will prevail in Paris.</i>

04:56.200 --> 04:59.120
&lrm;Don't even think of going
&lrm;near my daughter's bag!

04:59.280 --> 05:01.360
&lrm;Do you know who I am?

05:01.520 --> 05:04.640
&lrm;Gentlemen, this is a school.
&lrm;Think of the children.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.520
&lrm;I'm sure the bracelet is

05:06.680 --> 05:07.800
&lrm;around here somewhere.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.800
&lrm;It probably just rolled out of her bag.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.800
&lrm;I'd try and get as far away
&lrm;as possible from that brat too.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.200
&lrm;[giggling]

05:16.360 --> 05:20.480
&lrm;Hey, Nino's been filming everything.
&lrm;We can see what really happened.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.440
<i>&lrm;Marinette will come round</i>
<i>&lrm;to pass out some fresh croissants.</i>

05:23.600 --> 05:24.640
&lrm;[accelerated voice]

05:25.280 --> 05:26.720
&lrm;[Marinette] There you have it.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.960
&lrm;Sabrina was holding it.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.440
&lrm;Yes, but I gave it back straight after.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.200
&lrm;Chloe, take a look in your BFF's bag.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.480
&lrm;Are you saying I'm a thief?

05:36.640 --> 05:39.200
&lrm;No.
&lrm;Chloe's the one calling people thieves.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.160
&lrm;I'm going by what's on the video.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.600
&lrm;[irritated groan]

05:42.760 --> 05:43.880
&lrm;[gasps]

05:46.240 --> 05:47.760
&lrm;[gasps]

05:48.880 --> 05:51.880
&lrm;Yes, I sketched it,
&lrm;but I didn't do anything else.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.280
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

06:00.960 --> 06:02.000
&lrm;[she gasps]

06:02.320 --> 06:03.600
<i>&lrm;You're under arrest.</i>

06:04.080 --> 06:05.560
&lrm;What? What for?

06:05.720 --> 06:06.760
<i>&lrm;Littering,</i>

06:06.920 --> 06:08.960
<i>&lrm;jaywalking, and crossing on a red light.</i>

06:09.680 --> 06:12.920
&lrm;Well, I suppose...
&lrm;I did but you can't arrest me.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.880
&lrm;Who are you any anyway?
&lrm;You don't look like a policeman.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.400
<i>&lrm;I sentence you to litter duty.</i>

06:21.800 --> 06:23.360
&lrm;[whistle blows]

06:23.520 --> 06:25.360
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;[whirring]

06:25.520 --> 06:28.440
<i>&lrm;Next mission,</i>
<i>&lrm;seek justice from Mayor Bourgeois.</i>

06:28.600 --> 06:29.840
&lrm;[Mayor] Give me the tape.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.120
&lrm;I'll have it analysed.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.520
&lrm;-No, it's my camera.
&lrm;-Do you know who I am?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.920
&lrm;[Plagg struggles] I'm the Mayor!

06:36.080 --> 06:37.920
&lrm;[Mayor] Where's the principle?

06:38.080 --> 06:39.800
&lrm;I want to see him now!

06:42.000 --> 06:45.640
&lrm;I won't bother you with the story,
&lrm;it's a long, boring...

06:45.800 --> 06:48.800
&lrm;Yes you will, and fast.
&lrm;We have a big problem.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.960
&lrm;If by big you're referring to my hard abs,
&lrm;thanks for noticing.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.920
&lrm;[whirring and stomping]

06:56.080 --> 06:58.440
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Now we have a bigger problem.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.640
&lrm;Hey! You can't just walk in here.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.360
<i>&lrm;I can go wherever I want,</i>
<i>&lrm;whenever I want.</i>

07:03.520 --> 07:05.000
<i>&lrm;I am the law.</i>

07:05.160 --> 07:06.840
&lrm;Well, I'm the authority here.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.800
<i>&lrm;You are guilty of obstructing</i>
<i>&lrm;the path of justice.</i>

07:09.960 --> 07:12.120
&lrm;[zapping] <i>&lrm;I sentence you to do laps.</i>

07:12.280 --> 07:13.320
&lrm;[he sighs]

07:13.600 --> 07:15.200
&lrm;[whistle blows]

07:15.360 --> 07:18.080
&lrm;[yelling] Wait.
&lrm;I can't... control... my arms.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.600
&lrm;Why can't I transform?

07:19.760 --> 07:24.400
&lrm;The bracelet will get absorbed
&lrm;with me and damage your powers.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.200
&lrm;[irritated groan]

07:26.360 --> 07:28.400
&lrm;[evil cackling]

07:28.560 --> 07:32.880
&lrm;Soon, Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will show up to meet their doom.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.120
&lrm;See, Chloe? I tripped on the bag,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.720
&lrm;Sabrina held the bracelet
&lrm;and Nathaniel sketched it.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.440
&lrm;We are all suspects.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.320
&lrm;What's that supposed to mean?
&lrm;I didn't swipe it.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.000
&lrm;And neither did I

07:46.160 --> 07:48.880
&lrm;but Chloe could accuse
&lrm;anyone and everyone.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.760
&lrm;Fine, since you're a suspect,
&lrm;you'll let me search your bag.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.720
&lrm;Ok, but only if search everyone else's
&lrm;too.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.160
&lrm;No-one's rummaging in my bag.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.400
&lrm;Marinette, let the adults handle this.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.920
&lrm;She called me a thief.
&lrm;I'm just defending myself.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.920
&lrm;You're also accusing your friends
&lrm;like Chloe's doing.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.000
&lrm;I'm Chloe's BFF.
&lrm;I wouldn't steal from her.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.440
&lrm;What about Adrien?
&lrm;He's in 4 seconds of that video.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.440
&lrm;And we haven't seen him since.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
&lrm;Not Adrien.
&lrm;Why would he steal a bracelet?

08:17.760 --> 08:19.840
&lrm;If anyone's guilty, it's one of us.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.160
&lrm;Are you accusing us?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.320
&lrm;I want an attorney.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.560
&lrm;[Dad] Marinette, stop.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.880
&lrm;[Max] We should search the parents.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.600
&lrm;[Rogercop] <i>&lrm;Where is the Mayor?</i>

08:26.920 --> 08:27.720
&lrm;Dad?

08:27.840 --> 08:28.880
&lrm;That's your dad?

08:29.600 --> 08:32.200
&lrm;-Hello, may I help you?
<i>&lrm;-Where is the Mayor?</i>

08:32.480 --> 08:33.880
&lrm;I think he already left.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.039
<i>&lrm;Are you lying?</i>

08:35.200 --> 08:37.120
&lrm;Yes... I mean no.

08:37.280 --> 08:40.200
<i>&lrm;If nobody speaks up, I'll arrest you all.</i>

08:40.360 --> 08:41.960
<i>&lrm;Where is your father?</i>

08:42.120 --> 08:43.159
&lrm;I don't know.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.520
&lrm;[Mayor shouting] Mr. Principle,

08:45.680 --> 08:47.200
&lrm;find out who stole it ASAP!

08:47.360 --> 08:49.480
&lrm;[Mayor] Or your job is on the line.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.040
&lrm;My Daughter has been treated
&lrm;with disrespect.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.000
&lrm;I was only defending myself.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.400
&lrm;My dad's right,
&lrm;I accused everyone in the process.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.800
&lrm;I don't think any of us took it.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.920
&lrm;You'll find a way to make it right.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.720
&lrm;Yeah, well, right now,
&lrm;I've gotta transform.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.960
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

09:22.360 --> 09:24.800
&lrm;[struggling]
&lrm;[groaning]

09:25.600 --> 09:29.440
&lrm;I thought it was camembert.
&lrm;Anyone can make a mistake.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.160
&lrm;You're always thinking
&lrm;with your stomach... Wait.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.560
&lrm;A bit of pepper...

09:36.960 --> 09:38.280
&lrm;[Plagg sniffs]

09:38.440 --> 09:39.680
&lrm;[he sneezes loudly]

&lrm;[Adrien] <i>&lrm;Gesundheit!</i>

09:41.480 --> 09:42.840
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

09:57.680 --> 09:58.800
&lrm;I'm warning you,

09:58.960 --> 10:01.160
&lrm;if you don't find it by this evening,

10:01.320 --> 10:04.360
&lrm;I'll cut off all funding for the school.
&lrm;Understood?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.480
&lrm;But how am I supposed to...

10:06.920 --> 10:08.280
&lrm;[they gasp]

10:08.680 --> 10:11.200
&lrm;Didn't anyone ever teach you to knock?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.960
<i>&lrm;Justice doesn't need an invitation.</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:15.600
<i>&lrm;Mayor, you're under arrest</i>

10:16.040 --> 10:17.640
&lrm;[Gasping] Look who's talking.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400

&lrm;Mr. Rogercop, I need your help.

&lrm;Listen,

&lrm;Don't let the evil person

11:30.800 --> 11:32.480
&lrm;make an evil cop out of you.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.440
&lrm;Don't listen to her.
&lrm;Take their Miraculouses!

&lrm;I've got a serious problem,

&lrm;worse than a bad hair day.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.560
<i>&lrm;-Come, we'll talk about it.</i>
&lrm;-OK

&lrm;Where are you going?
&lrm;Who's going to drive this car?

12:44.440 --> 12:46.040
&lrm;Did I thank you for the lift?

&lrm;What have you done?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.000
&lrm;Snatch his Miraculous!

&lrm;[Ladybug] There's no point
&lrm;running after him.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.640
&lrm;He's way out of reach now.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.400
&lrm;Well, if it's the mayor he wants...

14:01.560 --> 14:03.800
&lrm;He'll be heading for the city hall.

&lrm;So now we're the nation's

15:34.160 --> 15:35.640
&lrm;We haven't done anything.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.160
&lrm;You can't accuse someone
&lrm;without proof.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.720
&lrm;We should defend ourselves in court.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.240
&lrm;Not while Rogercop's
&lrm;the Chief of Justice.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.000
&lrm;[sighing]
&lrm;How many times have we saved Paris?

&lrm;Ladybug, over there.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.080
&lrm;That's Chloe's bracelet.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.840
&lrm;Exactly what I need.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.120
&lrm;Fend off Rogercop as long as you can.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.600
&lrm;Whenever you're ready.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.840
&lrm;Cataclysm!

&lrm;[fading cry] <i>&lrm;No!</i>

19:00.720 --> 19:02.520
&lrm;Do more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.600
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:12.400 --> 19:13.080
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:14.280 --> 19:16.000
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.520
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

&lrm;[she cheers]

&lrm;[he gasps and laughs]

19:30.000 --> 19:32.600
&lrm;[gasping] What am I doing up here?

19:33.160 --> 19:34.280
&lrm;[together] Pount it!

19:34.440 --> 19:35.760
&lrm;As Rogercop would say,

19:35.920 --> 19:38.400
&lrm;[Robotically]
&lrm;Justice has prevailed in Paris.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.760
&lrm;[bleeping]

19:40.480 --> 19:43.360
&lrm;I'd stick around
&lrm;but you'd see me without my mask

19:43.520 --> 19:45.400
&lrm;and you wouldn't be able to resist me.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.200
&lrm;I doubt it,
&lrm;but I'll take your word for it.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.080
&lrm;[she chuckles]

19:59.320 --> 20:02.120
&lrm;You may have eluded me this time,
&lrm;Ladybug,

20:02.280 --> 20:05.560
&lrm;but one of these days,
&lrm;I'll be ruling the world,

20:05.720 --> 20:08.920
&lrm;and you and Cat Noir
&lrm;won't be a part of it!

20:12.320 --> 20:14.280
&lrm;[Roger] I think this belongs to you.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.520
&lrm;My bag... my...my bracelet.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.840
&lrm;But... how?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.520
&lrm;Roger... you found the bracelet?

20:22.840 --> 20:26.120
&lrm;It was in Chloe's bag all along.
&lrm;It must have fallen

20:26.280 --> 20:29.320
&lrm;into a side-pocket
&lrm;when that girl tripped.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.840
&lrm;Roger, I apologize for being accusatory

20:32.000 --> 20:34.240
&lrm;and for firing you for no good reason.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.160
&lrm;I think Officer Roger
&lrm;has proven his worth.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.760
&lrm;You'd be wrong not to keep him.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.240
&lrm;Of course, Ladybug,
&lrm;you're absolutely right.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.760
&lrm;And it's actually Lieutenant Roger now.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.440
&lrm;Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.040
&lrm;I'm proud to be on the force

20:47.200 --> 20:48.800
&lrm;and I vow to uphold my belief

20:48.960 --> 20:51.600
&lrm;that everyone is innocent
&lrm;until proven guilty.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.240
&lrm;[earing bleeps]

20:53.400 --> 20:57.560
&lrm;Very good, a valuable lesson learnt,
&lrm;right Chloe?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.480
&lrm;[she groans] Yes, daddy.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.640
&lrm;Lesson learnt.
