WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.477
Geordie Shore is back in Newcastle.
Home sweet fucking home.

00:10.543 --> 00:13.947
(cheering)
We're back with a fucking boom.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.517
Get in!

00:21.287 --> 00:22.722
Come on.
(whooping)

00:24.023 --> 00:27.360
And bang! Me, Marnie, drink, work
is not a good idea.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.162
She's a massive, flirty slag.

00:29.229 --> 00:33.099
I can't take it any more.
My eyes are burning. (shouting)

00:33.166 --> 00:35.802
Everyone's fucking kicking off.
Oh, shit!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.937
She goes or I fucking go!

00:38.004 --> 00:42.308
She's just came in and fucking ruined
it all. Everything's changed.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.879
Oi, oi!
Jay fucking walks in the door.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.547
(giggling)

00:47.614 --> 00:49.983
Sounds like a lot of shit
has happened.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.852
It's the most tested
our friendship's ever been.

00:56.256 --> 00:59.025
Gaz has said sorry, it's all sorted.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.427
I ain't coming back.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.128
There's no way I'm going back.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.899
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.967
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:08.034 --> 01:11.037
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.772
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:12.839 --> 01:15.375
I would never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.644
Hardest graft I've ever done is me
hair.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.346
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.615
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

01:31.391 --> 01:32.625
I'm off.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.495
I've had a mint time in the house,
I've come back in,

01:35.562 --> 01:39.065
got the family back together.
Now it's time for me to do one.

01:39.132 --> 01:43.970
It was short and sweet.
Good to have you, mate. Bye, babe.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.942
Jay's heading home.
He's done what he needed to,

01:49.008 --> 01:52.645
sort the fucking family out.
But now we've got Marnie coming back

01:52.712 --> 01:55.615
and I bet any money
shit kicks off between the girls.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.762
I'm still full of anger
about Marnie.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.698
I can't get me head around the fact

02:11.764 --> 02:14.267
that she could be coming back
to live with us.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.635
What the fuck?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.909
Marnie left
cos of a fight with Holly,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.345
but there's a chance
she could come back.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.986
I'm pissed off about
Gary and Marnie at work,

02:33.052 --> 02:35.655
but I wanna hear her side
cos I still like her.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.260
We have a feeling
Marnie's gonna come back today.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.596
If she does, it's gonna be
a complete fucking disaster.

02:48.535 --> 02:52.972
She's got a nerve if she thinks she's
coming back to play happy families.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.240
Not how it's gonna be.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.575
If she does come back,

02:55.642 --> 02:58.811
I feel she doesn't know
who she wants out of Scott or Gary.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.481
She'll probably get
four-balled by them both.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.183
Gary was a snake and betrayed Scott,

03:04.250 --> 03:07.987
and I think this is a real test
to whether he'll do this again.

03:08.054 --> 03:12.659
He's gotta speak to her once, but if
he speaks to her again, we're done.

03:12.725 --> 03:16.296
I really don't think the lads are
gonna stick up for me and Holly.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.865
I think Marnie's
gonna walk through the door

03:18.932 --> 03:21.768
and they're gonna be like,
"Hi, Marnie, are you OK?"

03:41.387 --> 03:44.357
But if we try, they'll
probably kick off. (chuckles)

03:44.424 --> 03:46.693
Fucking hell!
Hiya.

03:46.759 --> 03:48.361
Fuck! Marnie's back.

03:48.428 --> 03:51.364
I know we talked about it,
but shit's just got real.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.667
How are ya?
I'm all right. How are yous?

03:54.734 --> 03:56.469
Good, good.

03:56.536 --> 04:01.174
I walk in to find James and Gary in
the garden. I'm happy it's just them

04:01.240 --> 04:05.712
because them two are the only people
who I feel comfortable talking to.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.184
I'm so nervous about seeing Scott.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.786
I don't know how he's gonna act
when he sees us.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.888
I haven't been here
to defend myself.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.591
God knows what the lasses
drilled into his head.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.563
Marnie needs to know the position
the girls have put us in

04:23.630 --> 04:27.233
by saying we're not allowed to talk
to her or they won't talk to us.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.812
It's just so fucking nasty

04:39.879 --> 04:42.849
that the girls would stop the boys
from speaking to us.

04:49.288 --> 04:52.258
Hello. Hiya.
Where the fuck have you been?

04:52.325 --> 04:54.861
I walk out the toilet
after having a Johnson.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.063
Fuck me, Marnie's there.
I'm buzzing.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.400
Wasn't expecting to see you here,
like. Had a little break.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.968
Did ya?
Mm-hmm.

05:02.035 --> 05:06.739
I can't believe how happy Scott is
to see us. He's genuinely happy.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.776
If he's all right with me,
then so should the girls.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.520
Yeah, I know.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.122
I shouldn't have flirted with Gary.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.726
It's the past and we can't change
it. I just wanna forget about it.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.763
Course we are.
We were never not friends.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.367
High five.
Nice. Give us a cuddle.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.136
Holly and Charlotte
won't be as forgiving.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.639
It'll take a lot more than sorry
and a hug.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.345
Me and Charlotte walk back in.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.815
We're expecting
Marnie to be in the kitchen

05:48.881 --> 05:51.718
sucking Gary and Scott off.
But she's not there.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.387
(shouts)
Oh, they're back.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.722
(laughs)

05:55.788 --> 06:00.059
Holly and Charlotte are back, they
don't realise Marnie's here as well.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.195
But fuck that, I'm not telling them.

06:13.506 --> 06:17.977
Gary tells us Marnie's back and she's
in her bed as if nothing's happened.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.313
I'm like,
"Fuck me, she's fucking game."

06:25.284 --> 06:29.088
I'm upstairs and I hear Charlotte
and Holly smashing things up.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.357
But fuck them,
I'm not scared of them.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.560
What you doing? What you doing?
(banging)

06:34.627 --> 06:38.397
We're banging on the walls, smashing
things, marking our territory.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.873
Like they've been released
from the zoo.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.024
Scott's saying that
Marnie was scared to come back

07:05.091 --> 07:08.427
and blah, blah, fucking blah.
Like, all he's done

07:08.494 --> 07:12.565
is been sucked in by these shitty
words she's twisted in his head.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.501
It must be hard for someone...
It must be...

07:15.568 --> 07:18.538
Oh, my fucking God!
Are you fucking kidding?

07:18.604 --> 07:22.608
She's dug her own grave,
she can lie in it. OK. I understand.

07:22.675 --> 07:27.180
They've got no loyalties whatsoever.
Charlotte is going fucking mental.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.650
She's fucked you off
with your so-called best friend.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.319
It's a joke enough
that you forgive him,

07:33.386 --> 07:36.389
never mind let her walk in
and pussy-foot around her.

07:36.455 --> 07:39.158
She's a fucking slut!
She's deceived us all.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.828
I don't know why
she's lying in that bed now.

07:41.894 --> 07:45.865
And I dunno why any of yous
would even talk to her. All right.

07:45.932 --> 07:49.902
I don't understand how Charlotte's
so angry. She's off the fucking map.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.206
Either she doesn't like Marnie
or it's about her and Gary.

07:59.679 --> 08:03.282
Charlotte's screaming. I won't
let anyone speak to me like that.

08:03.349 --> 08:06.786
I'm not gonna let them girls
push us out. I'm in it till the end.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.055
Are you come smack us
like you did her? No.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.891
You dragged her hair.
Shut the fuck up.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.861
All I can hear is the birds
screaming at each other.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.798
Maybe I should split it up but
I can't be fucking arsed. Crack on.

08:18.865 --> 08:23.536
You're a little slut! You're fucking
ran at me, you stupid little scumbag!

08:23.603 --> 08:27.006
I'm so angry because I feel like
she's just walked back in,

08:27.073 --> 08:29.709
not accepted responsibility
for what she did,

08:29.775 --> 08:32.010
and has got the lads
back on her side.

08:36.749 --> 08:40.385
Of course. You're a stupid little
scumbag. No one wants you here.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.587
I don't know how
we recover from this.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.424
I can't even look at her,
let alone live with her.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.693
I don't want you in this house.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.530
You're gonna stay here and
no one's gonna speak to ya? Good.

08:58.604 --> 09:01.807
Who does Charlotte think she is,
calling me a slag?

09:01.874 --> 09:04.477
I might be a flirt
but I'm definitely not a slut.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.346
I've kissed one person
in this house, Scott,

09:07.413 --> 09:10.850
and had a harmless flirt with Gary.
That doesn't make us a slag.

09:10.917 --> 09:15.321
I'm absolutely fucking shaking.
I'm fucking shaking.

09:20.693 --> 09:24.597
Gaz, I can't... I don't know...
I wasn't there. I wasn't there.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.300
All Scott and Gary do
is think with their cocks.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.770
If they thought with their head
or heart, they'd be on our side

09:30.836 --> 09:32.905
knowing that we're a family.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.908
Can everyone just chill out?
Ah, Holly, man.

09:37.343 --> 09:41.080
I'm absolutely gutted. Even
a burnt sausage won't sort this out.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.685
I came in, I had one chat with her.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.322
You were supposed to tell her
you wouldn't be speaking to her.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.123
I said when the girls come in...

09:51.190 --> 09:53.626
She's acting like
you're talking to her.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.529
The lads, as to be expected,
are quivering away.

09:56.595 --> 09:59.699
They haven't got our backs.
What stupid arseholes.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.337
You know, Holly's been fucked over
one too many times by you, by you,

10:04.403 --> 10:08.007
and now by her. And you started
this, and I don't think it's fair.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.676
Started what?
I had one conversation with her.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.879
One conversation. So did Scott.
That was it.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.585
I hope they don't
rip each other's heads off.

10:19.652 --> 10:23.022
It's a long time since the words
Gaz, Charlotte, and shag pad

10:23.089 --> 10:27.026
have been in the same sentence.
She's standing dancing by herself

10:27.093 --> 10:29.862
and I'm starting to feel
really awful about it all.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.331
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

10:32.398 --> 10:32.598
.

10:37.403 --> 10:37.603
.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.557
So I go to check on Marnie.
I'm expecting her to be crying,

10:58.624 --> 11:01.727
but she seems all right.
She's tougher than she looks.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.798
Oh, fucking hell, man. I didn't
think it was gonna gan that bad.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.867
I knew it was.
Did ya?

11:07.933 --> 11:11.103
Oh, my God. It's
a fucking bad situation this, man.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.006
I think James was expecting us
to be crying.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.410
It has really upset us
and I am holding me tears back,

11:17.476 --> 11:20.046
but I will not let anyone know
it's got to us.

11:20.112 --> 11:24.450
Charlotte's just really worked up.
I think they've worked themselves up

11:24.517 --> 11:27.987
with them both being together
and you not being there. Yeah.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.856
When they've seen you,
they've fucking exploded.

11:30.923 --> 11:34.560
The lads, none of us want this
to happen. We don't want arguments.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.197
We want everyone to get on
and have a fucking good time.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.567
I'm not really sure on what to say
to Marnie to cheer her up.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.370
But I think she just needs someone
to listen to her.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.238
I'm just gonna sit here and nod.

11:46.305 --> 11:50.776
Because they're mean they think that
this might be a way to get us out,

11:50.843 --> 11:52.378
they're gonna keep going.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.081
It was more Charlotte
arguing with you than Holly.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.883
You haven't done anything
to Charlotte, have you?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.785
Charlotte's jealous cos of Gary.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.924
Charlotte seems more bothered
than anyone about this.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.961
She's still bothered about Gary,
and she's jealous we were flirting.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.897
I'd have a lot more respect for her
if she told us,

12:11.964 --> 12:14.166
instead of using the fight
as an excuse.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.403
Maybe we're just gonna have to
just see what happens.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.004
(they sigh)

12:24.110 --> 12:26.011
(banging)

12:28.948 --> 12:30.483
Marnie came into this house

12:30.549 --> 12:33.486
with intentions of wanting
to fuck every single lad.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.721
The first thing she said
to Holly was

12:35.788 --> 12:39.125
"What's happening with you
and Scott? I wanna get with him."

12:39.191 --> 12:40.726
What kind of girl does that?

12:40.793 --> 12:43.429
She had no intentions
of making friends with us.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.973
I don't feel like going out tonight,
especially not with everyone.

12:54.039 --> 12:57.409
I feel like I've got no one with us,
and I'm totally alone.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.183
I'm buzzing for tonight.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.286
No drama cos that stupid idiot's
not coming out.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.732
I just want it to be like
old times,

13:19.798 --> 13:22.201
Gary and Scott
trying to pull random fanny.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.917
The girls are desperate
for us to pull.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.587
I think it's more about pissing
Marnie off than us getting a bang.

13:55.267 --> 13:59.405
Gary's pulled but Scott looks like
he needs help. I'm stepping in.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.508
I'm not letting Scott go home
and spoon Marnie.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.926
Shit! This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.668
I pulled this bird and wanna
take her back and nest her.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.961
Charlotte has lost the plot.
I don't trust her motives.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.564
As much as I wanna smash a bird,
I'm not going to.

14:58.631 --> 14:59.999
It'll be shady on Marnie.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.982
We all get back to the house
and I'm fucking mortal.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.319
I'm just glad Marnie's in bed
because I don't want round two.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.354
Round three? Round four.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.597
It makes us feel on edge when I see
Charlotte and Gaz getting friendly

15:31.664 --> 15:33.599
cos we all know where that leads to.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.507
Right, one, two...
Gary, no.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.543
Gary, no! Please! Please, please.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.349
Things are getting
far too flirtatious.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.252
What the fuck?
Surely he's not gonna go back there.

15:59.191 --> 16:03.696
I'm in bed and Charlotte sits at the
bottom of me bed and starts chatting.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.431
This feels like old times.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.702
I'm really drunk.

16:09.768 --> 16:13.005
Me and Gary are having a laugh,
getting on dead well...

16:13.072 --> 16:17.242
...in the shag pad. Shit!
Why am I in the shag pad with Gary?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.923
It has been a long time since the
words Gaz, Charlotte and shag pad

16:30.989 --> 16:32.725
have been in the same sentence.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.166
I'm gonna go away now. Bye, Gary.

17:00.486 --> 17:03.689
I don't know if I can forgive the
girls for what they've done.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.892
I would understand
if Gary was in the same seat as me,

17:06.959 --> 17:09.094
but they've left me out.
It's not fair.

17:22.207 --> 17:26.612
We now need to get them speaking,
then it's happy fucking days.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.518
This house must be
doing Marnie's head in,

17:32.584 --> 17:35.120
so me and Scott
are gonna take her surfing.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.524
But in the back of me head,
this is gonna be quite weird,

17:38.590 --> 17:41.026
cos it's me, Scott and Marnie.
Awkward.

17:42.694 --> 17:46.465
I come out of the changing rooms
to find the boys in their wetsuits.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.334
Scott's got the Australian
surfer thing going on,

17:49.401 --> 17:51.236
but Gary's got the bigger bulge.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.338
What the fuck's going on here?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.574
Marnie asked for help
doing her wetsuit,

17:55.641 --> 17:59.077
but the look Scott's giving us,
I might as well be licking her out.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.879
What's happened there?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.783
After seeing how the girls reacted,

18:04.850 --> 18:08.187
I think I should leave things
with me and Scott.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.556
I don't want to make things worse.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.628
We're meant to be surfing, but
Scott and Marnie are just chilling.

18:16.695 --> 18:17.963
I'm staying out the way.

18:18.030 --> 18:22.968
Listen, there's nothing at all with
me and Gary, though. Nothing at all.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.505
Marnie's banging on about
what happened between her and Gary.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.941
Put a new mix in, kid,
cos you're boring us.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.610
The girls thought
something was going on.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.346
The girls have done everything
to make it worse.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.414
Don't kick off.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.349
I should be able to defend myself

18:37.416 --> 18:40.619
and you shouldn't be listening
to what they say.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.922
Marnie thinks I listen
to the lasses too much. Of course.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.925
Charlotte's me best mate.
I trust them more than you.

19:05.844 --> 19:09.281
You know how we're doing
all the bucket list things,

19:09.348 --> 19:12.684
you'll fucking buzz off this.
Have you heard of rap jumping?

19:12.751 --> 19:15.254
It's like Mission Impossible,

19:15.320 --> 19:18.957
where they fucking run off the side
of a building with a rope attached.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.827
I've found a place
near London what does it.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.863
Scott's bucket list idea
is rap jumping in London.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.667
That means we have a night out and
do a wicked activity. I can't wait.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.202
It'd be fucking mayhem.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.076
If we're going to London,
Charlotte's boyfriend is in London,

19:38.143 --> 19:40.178
so why can't we meet Mitch?

19:40.245 --> 19:42.548
It would be the perfect opportunity.
Try.

19:42.614 --> 19:46.184
I'll bash. If he says no, he says no.
I'd like to meet him.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.754
What?

19:52.357 --> 19:53.358
Holly?
Yeah?

19:53.425 --> 19:55.861
I feel like we can try and get
Mitch to come out.

19:55.928 --> 19:59.398
Everybody wants to meet Mitch.
I want him to come out in London,

19:59.464 --> 20:01.567
but I'm scared if I ask,
he won't come.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.437
Do you think he will, though?
No.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.439
I really wanna meet him.

20:07.506 --> 20:10.776
Charlotte's scared of inviting Mitch
to London but I'm not.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.478
I feel like Mitch wouldn't
be able to say no to me

20:13.545 --> 20:16.949
because I'm Charlotte's best friend.
So I'm gonna ring him.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.585
Go ring him. I trust ya.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.054
Tell him I love him
Tell him he's me life.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.756
This has got to work,
fingers crossed.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.860
Hiya, is that Mitch?

20:28.927 --> 20:31.063
It's Holly, Charlotte's best friend.

20:31.129 --> 20:32.965
Yeah, I'm good. How are you?

20:33.966 --> 20:38.904
Basically what I'm ringing you for is
we're coming to London tomorrow night

20:38.971 --> 20:41.807
and I thought I could persuade you
to come out.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.676
I'm thinking,
"This is gonna go brilliantly."

20:46.712 --> 20:47.813
(laughs)

20:47.879 --> 20:49.881
And, no, he completely pies us.

20:49.948 --> 20:53.251
Why, Mitch? I thought you wouldn't
be able to say no to me.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.859
We're starting to believe
that you might not be real.

21:00.926 --> 21:04.129
This wasn't the best idea.
I'm scared to tell Charlotte.

21:04.196 --> 21:08.867
Right, OK, I don't know what else
I can do about this situation now.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.903
Bye.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.807
Well, that was a fucking disaster.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.609
Charlotte.

21:17.676 --> 21:18.977
What?

21:19.044 --> 21:21.046
He said no to me too.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.682
Oh, for fuck's sake, man!

21:23.749 --> 21:27.085
I'm really upset about it
but I don't wanna act like it,

21:27.152 --> 21:29.821
cos I don't wanna make meself
look stupid.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.291
I'm gonna act like it's fine,
when, really, I'm a bit gutted.

21:33.358 --> 21:36.028
Yeah, well,
I told you he wouldn't come.

21:37.295 --> 21:41.299
First night with us all together.
Think it's gonna go well?

21:41.366 --> 21:43.135
How you feeling Marnie?

21:45.504 --> 21:47.939
It's the first night out
since everything.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.909
I'm very nervous to see how it goes.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.846
If they act like that when sober,
I'm scared to see them drunk.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.816
With drink involved,
it's gonna go one or two ways.

21:59.384 --> 22:03.188
It could go worse and kick off,
or it could get better.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.490
Tonight
is family fucking reunion night.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.393
Let's hope the girls
don't rip each other's head off.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.600
We're going out, all of us,
even Marnie. But it's OK.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.536
The lads are gonna talk to Marnie

22:17.602 --> 22:19.638
and me and Holly
are gonna get drunk.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.240
Everything's going to be fine.

22:34.252 --> 22:38.090
So I get to Bijoux
and it's really awkward already.

22:38.156 --> 22:41.326
I'm on me own. The boys are
with Charlotte and Holly.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.428
I don't know what to do.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.831
I'll get mortal so I don't notice.

22:52.504 --> 22:56.942
I preferred it when Charlotte was
ignoring Gaz, and fucking hated him,

22:57.008 --> 23:00.045
cos this whole being friends crap
just isn't gonna work.

23:19.364 --> 23:23.368
Marnie is dancing on her own
and the girls couldn't give a fuck.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.375
I'm sick of this. Either the lasses
need to sort it out or Scott does.

23:47.726 --> 23:50.762
James is the only lad
with big enough brain cells

23:50.829 --> 23:53.431
to have a conversation
while we're this drunk.

24:06.511 --> 24:10.248
I'm really hoping her boyfriend
Mitch comes in London tomorrow.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.451
It looks like she needs attention
from him, and not Gary.

24:16.354 --> 24:19.558
I'm still dancing on me own
and it's horrible.

24:19.624 --> 24:23.195
I don't know how two girls
could make someone feel like that.

24:27.999 --> 24:31.403
Things aren't going to plan.
The lads aren't speaking to Marnie.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.972
She's standing, dancing by herself

24:34.039 --> 24:37.142
and I'm starting to feel
really awful about it all.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.212
I can't watch
someone be so left out.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.140
So Holly's telling me
she feels guilty.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.943
It's good
the girls are gonna sort things out.

25:14.512 --> 25:18.516
Tonight has been horrible.
Like, I just wanna keep hating Marnie

25:18.583 --> 25:21.553
but I can't.
And right now I just wanna go home.

25:25.190 --> 25:29.060
Gary's pulled Beki again. She's a
proper nice lass. We get on so well.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.595
So, now I've got a friend.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.534
I'm not arsed
Gaz talks to Marnie.

25:36.601 --> 25:41.373
I'm just bothered that she's playing
games and Gaz is getting led on.

25:46.311 --> 25:50.615
Fuck this. The easiest-case scenario
here is get Beki back to the house,

25:50.682 --> 25:52.284
run into bed and hide.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.620
Scott's gonna kick off. World War 19.
That looked weird.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.523
What? I'm just sitting with a girl
I'm taking home.

25:58.590 --> 26:01.126
I'm not flirting with her.
I've got a girl.

26:01.192 --> 26:04.162
You need to sort yourself out,
put bros before hos,

26:04.229 --> 26:08.066
or end up with no mates.
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

26:10.235 --> 26:10.435
.

26:12.971 --> 26:13.171
.

26:23.648 --> 26:27.252
I'm in the taxi with Gary and Beki
and I'm absolutely mortal.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.553
(giggles)

26:37.562 --> 26:41.299
If my apparent best mate
wants to do that to me,

26:41.366 --> 26:43.368
then I'll take his face off.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.604
(slurs drunkenly)

26:46.671 --> 26:48.106
Marnie. Get in!
Marnie!

26:48.173 --> 26:50.308
I need fresh air.
I'm lying on the grass

26:50.375 --> 26:52.377
because I can't walk,
I'm that drunk.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.548
Get up now. I can't see anything.
I know, just stand up.

26:56.614 --> 27:00.518
Marnie is paralytic. I need
to pick her up, get in the house.

27:00.585 --> 27:04.956
I wanna get in bed with Beki ASAP.
(farts, laughs)

27:05.023 --> 27:10.161
Just my luck I've got Marnie over me
shoulder when their taxi rocks up.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.864
Scott's gonna kick off. World War 19.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.432
What?

27:20.438 --> 27:23.641
I'm sitting with a girl
I'm taking home.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.745
She said, "Pick Marnie up
and take her in the house."

27:28.947 --> 27:31.182
Doesn't matter who you're pulling.

27:31.249 --> 27:35.020
I don't understand how anyone can
kick off at me flirting with Marnie.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.689
Are they forgetting
I've got a bird?

27:37.756 --> 27:40.625
I'm not flirting with her.
I've got another girl.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.938
I've told Scott time after time
after time, a million times,

27:54.005 --> 27:57.542
I would never go there. There's only
so many times I can tell him.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.544
It needs to go in that thick head.

28:06.251 --> 28:09.220
We get back in, and I don't know
how this has happened,

28:09.287 --> 28:11.322
but me, Holly and Marnie
are talking.

28:11.389 --> 28:14.692
I wanted to come over to you
and I wanted to say, "Are you OK?"

28:14.759 --> 28:17.162
And I think this is us making up.

28:17.228 --> 28:19.664
We pushed the lads to speak to you.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.534
I've been in that position
where I've been alone.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.969
It's fucking heartbreaking
to watch you.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.239
Even though right now
I've got so much hate towards her,

28:28.306 --> 28:32.377
I can't help but feel sorry for her
because I know that situation.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.847
As much as I didn't wanna speak
to you, didn't wanna do that,

28:35.914 --> 28:37.582
it fucking broke my heart.

28:37.649 --> 28:41.686
It's so weird thinking me and Holly
didn't wanna speak to Marnie again,

28:41.753 --> 28:44.489
hated her so much,
and now we're all talking nicely.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.325
We've all done something bad.
Oh, course.

28:47.392 --> 28:51.329
I am so embarrassed and humiliated
cos of that night with me and Holly.

28:51.396 --> 28:56.501
The girls are like new best friends.
Eh? Have I missed something?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.570
I was gonna apologise for snapping.

28:58.636 --> 29:01.639
(stutters) Holly's snapped,
you've snapped.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.976
You know what it's like.
We've all done something wrong now.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.479
Me, Holly and Charlotte
have apologised

29:07.545 --> 29:11.049
and we've made up
but we're all fucking steaming.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.152
I hope things don't change tomorrow
when we're sober.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.664
Charlotte and Holly
are getting in his head.

29:26.731 --> 29:29.467
I would never go there with Marnie.
I am just friends.

29:31.636 --> 29:35.473
The more you bang on about it,
the more guilty it makes you look.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.947
The mad thing is
he hasn't banged her yet.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.483
I'm with another girl
and he's still jealous.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.885
What's going on?

29:49.387 --> 29:51.289
I've sorted things with the girls.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.825
Next mission
is to sort things out with Scott.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.797
Even if Gary is being a snake
and trying to graft Marnie,

29:59.864 --> 30:02.133
it's my chod
she keeps running back to.

30:06.371 --> 30:10.308
He won't fucking shut up,
so I stick me tongue in his mouth.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.776
That'll keep him quiet.

30:20.952 --> 30:24.389
I'm so confused.
Me head's all over the place.

30:24.455 --> 30:28.059
Yesterday, I was not speaking
to the girls, now we've made up.

30:28.126 --> 30:31.262
Me and Scott had left things,
now we're all over each other.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.264
I don't know where I'm at.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.668
Can you?
Box, smile.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.369
I've got a nice box, though.

30:45.910 --> 30:46.945
Have you?

30:47.011 --> 30:48.947
Marnie's grinding all over me cock.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.482
I'm sick of dry humping,
she's not putting out.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.018
I wanna whips her kegs off
and pure blast her.

30:54.085 --> 30:55.553
Me bum is hurting!

31:01.159 --> 31:04.295
I'm having a cuddle.
Thank fuck I brought Beki back.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.764
It's like my escape from
this mad house.

31:24.849 --> 31:27.252
I'm thinking
Marnie's never gonna put out.

31:27.318 --> 31:30.722
The girl is all talk and
my right forearm is getting massive.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.644
Bye.

31:53.678 --> 31:54.779
Hi.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.382
Are you all right?
I'm a little bit rough.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.684
When me and Marnie made up
we were drunk.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.453
I just wanna make sure
everything's still OK.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.356
I wanted to talk to you
about last night and stuff.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.459
I am so glad that
we've cleared the air. I am.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.529
It wasn't nice to see you like that
last night.

32:11.596 --> 32:15.600
I am sorry if it looked like...
It's two against one. It's not fair.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.736
But I am just glad that
we sorted it out last night. Yeah.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.139
It was just getting ridiculous.
Yeah.

32:21.205 --> 32:23.941
I'm relieved that
me and the girls have made up,

32:24.008 --> 32:27.178
and I hope we can eventually
go back to the way things were.

32:27.245 --> 32:29.480
I'm excited for London now.

32:29.547 --> 32:32.817
In this house we all have fights,
we all have arguments.

32:32.884 --> 32:35.953
But at the end of the day
we are trying to be a family.

32:38.823 --> 32:41.225
Now we're packing for London.
I can't wait.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.996
We're on a night out and Scott's
bucket list. This should be epic.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.202
Today we're going to London.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.839
I know they think they're gonna meet
Mitch and he'll surprise us.

32:54.906 --> 32:55.973
And I know he's not.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.810
So I just feel a bit like a tit.
And I'm dreading it.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.947
Let's show these southerners
how us northern monkeys party.

33:08.853 --> 33:10.455
This looks wicked.

33:10.521 --> 33:14.959
Mate, this is way too posh for us.
Oh, my God, it's so tall!

33:15.993 --> 33:17.061
(Holly) Wow!

33:17.128 --> 33:22.133
We've arrived at the London hotel
and it's beautiful. It's so posh.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.436
It reminds us
of somewhere the Queen would live.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.139
Why the hell have they let us in?

33:28.206 --> 33:29.741
Fucking hell!

33:29.807 --> 33:31.642
(laughs) Fucking lethal!

33:31.709 --> 33:35.413
We've arrived in Knightsbridge.
The pad is fucking slick as fuck.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.048
Worthy for my royal chod.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.184
(indistinct chatter)

33:43.521 --> 33:45.189
(shouts indistinctly)

33:45.256 --> 33:47.859
Scott and Gaz have got a room
so they can cuddle,

33:47.925 --> 33:51.496
and now the girls are best mates
again, I've got a room to meself.

33:51.562 --> 33:52.563
Fucking get in!

33:59.303 --> 34:01.305
I've gotta bring last night up.

34:01.372 --> 34:05.343
He keeps getting jealous if I go near
Marnie. And he's got no reason to be.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.245
Your eyes burn the back of my head

34:07.311 --> 34:09.746
if I'm talking to her
or dancing next to her.

34:09.813 --> 34:10.815
No, no. Not all.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.886
You've been doing that and I've got
no problem with that at all, mate.

34:14.952 --> 34:18.656
(stutters) Mate, I just
didn't want it to happen again.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.458
I can't be arsed to argue
every time about Marnie.

34:21.525 --> 34:24.128
Gaz asking me
if I'm all right with him.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.998
Mate, just sort yourself out,
put bros before hos

34:27.063 --> 34:28.699
or you'll end up with no mates.

34:28.766 --> 34:31.936
So, do you not think
Mitch will come out tonight, then?

34:32.003 --> 34:34.237
Definitely not. I won't see him
tonight.

34:34.304 --> 34:38.042
No hope at all?
No hope. Not a cat in hell's chance.

34:38.109 --> 34:42.480
Everyone is still asking us about
Mitch, and it's making it worse.

34:42.547 --> 34:45.783
I'm gonna forget about it
and focus on having a good night,

34:45.850 --> 34:47.251
with Mitch not there.

34:47.318 --> 34:50.188
I think tonight will be a lot better
than last night.

34:50.254 --> 34:54.225
Obviously, now we're all talking
and we're back friends with Marnie.

34:59.997 --> 35:01.098
Yeah.

35:01.165 --> 35:04.802
I don't think we'll ever be best
friends or really close with Marnie,

35:04.869 --> 35:08.039
but the fact that we're speaking
is definitely progress.

35:17.682 --> 35:20.985
I don't understand why
we've never been to London together.

35:21.052 --> 35:24.755
It's just a bit crazy.
We're gonna have a fucking mint time.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.662
Cheers to London.
(all) Cheers!

35:31.729 --> 35:33.364
Let's get fucked.

35:33.431 --> 35:34.799
(laughs)

35:52.783 --> 35:55.620
Scott can't have all his own way.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.122
He wants to pull,
but have me to spoon.

35:58.189 --> 36:01.526
He gets jealous when I talk to boys.
It doesn't work like that.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.816
Why am I taking grief from Marnie?
I'm not with her, she plays games,

36:25.883 --> 36:29.487
I can't trust her and she doesn't
even open her fucking legs.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.725
(they laugh)

36:34.792 --> 36:36.561
I'm going for a drink.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.330
Mitch is here!

36:39.397 --> 36:41.966
What the fuck?
He could have turned up sober.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.136
The kid's fucking smashed.
(Gaz) He's being a dickhead.

36:45.202 --> 36:48.739
I'm so upset about
what's happened tonight. (door slams)

36:48.806 --> 36:51.576
I never, ever wanted it
to end this way. (sobs)

36:51.642 --> 36:54.145
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye.

36:56.314 --> 36:56.514
.

36:59.050 --> 36:59.250
.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.192
Hello.
How you doing?

37:11.796 --> 37:14.732
So, we get to the club
and it's absolutely amazing.

37:14.799 --> 37:18.369
We've got vodka, loads of champagne.
Everyone's in high spirits.

37:18.436 --> 37:22.006
I just feel like the family
is now back together. (cheering)

37:29.313 --> 37:32.783
Straightaway,
as soon as we get to the club,

37:32.850 --> 37:36.187
I see Scott scoping the building,
looking for girls.

37:36.253 --> 37:38.689
It's off-putting.
It's making us feel sick.

37:50.534 --> 37:54.372
James is telling us Scott like us,
but I'm not falling for it no more.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.108
If he liked us,
he wouldn't be looking for girls.

37:57.174 --> 37:59.243
He'd talk to us and tell us himself.

38:00.878 --> 38:03.614
Me and Holly are trying
to ignore Scott and Marnie

38:03.681 --> 38:07.952
and just have a good night but, eh,
what the fuck? Mitch is here.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.289
(whooping, laughter)

38:16.360 --> 38:20.364
I'm proper buzzing for Charlotte,
but the kid's fucking smashed.

38:33.010 --> 38:37.448
The moment everyone's been waiting
for, Mitch and Gary to unite.

38:37.515 --> 38:40.017
They shake hands,
give each other a hug,

38:40.084 --> 38:45.056
they're laughing together. This is
going so well, I am over the moon.

38:52.329 --> 38:55.800
I've lost Charlotte to Mitch,
but Mitch has brought this boy

38:55.866 --> 38:58.769
who's actually quite good-looking.
Buzzing.

39:03.274 --> 39:06.677
Mitch is mortal but Charlotte's
having such a good time.

39:06.744 --> 39:10.581
I'm with Mitch's fit friend and
Gary and Mitch are getting along.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.249
This is a perfect night.

39:19.557 --> 39:21.225
Don't! (screams)

39:21.292 --> 39:24.528
Mitch is really drunk.
I'm starting to worry a bit.

39:24.595 --> 39:28.532
He's dry-humping us, my hairpiece
is getting dragged out of my head.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.735
And then my nail snaps.

39:35.306 --> 39:39.043
Mitch was pissed when he turned up
but now he's literally mortal.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.344
He's being a dickhead.

39:53.791 --> 39:57.428
He's calling her the C word. No girl
should be spoken to like that.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.932
This couldn't have gone any worse.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.435
I'm starting to wish
he didn't come at all.

40:07.037 --> 40:11.175
I've done nothing wrong.
For all I know, we've now split up.

40:12.910 --> 40:13.944
Are you all right?

40:14.011 --> 40:18.249
Mitch kicked off, Charlotte's crying.
None of us know what's going on.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.800
I can't believe how much of a prick
Mitch is being.

40:35.866 --> 40:38.135
But fuck it, I've tried to help.

40:47.511 --> 40:50.881
I need to leave the club, I need to
get Mitch back to the hotel

40:50.948 --> 40:54.051
try and sober him up
before he ruins this night any more.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.020
First impressions always stick,

40:56.086 --> 41:00.591
and their first impression is that
he's a massive fucking bell-end.

41:05.596 --> 41:08.599
Mitch has got far too drunk
and he's acting like a dick.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.635
It's not the way
my best friend should be treated.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.040
Are you going?

41:21.212 --> 41:24.849
I've got Mitch back to the hotel,
but he wants us to go home with him.

41:24.915 --> 41:27.518
He's so mortal
I can't see the point in arguing.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.520
I hope nobody hates us for leaving.

41:41.765 --> 41:42.967
I'm so angry at Mitch.

41:43.033 --> 41:46.237
All Charlotte ever wanted him to do
was come to this house,

41:46.303 --> 41:48.305
meet everyone and have a good time.

41:48.372 --> 41:51.242
But he's got too drunk
and he's a fucking state.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.621
Holly's so angry.
I shouldn't be going with him,

42:03.687 --> 42:06.290
not after he's treat us like this
tonight.

42:06.357 --> 42:10.361
And I hope she doesn't hate us for
leaving and going with me boyfriend.

42:10.427 --> 42:11.762
I hope she understands,

42:11.829 --> 42:15.065
but right now I don't think
she's very happy with us at all.

42:19.603 --> 42:21.071
It's been a fucked-up night.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.342
I'm so upset about what's happened.

42:25.409 --> 42:28.012
because I never, ever
wanted it to end this way.

42:28.078 --> 42:29.747
Charlotte's gone with Mitch.

42:29.813 --> 42:32.816
I'm so upset because I feel like
she's chosen him over us.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.652
I don't know if she'll come back.

42:34.718 --> 42:38.389
She was fucking crying her eyes out
and he's still shouting at her,

42:38.455 --> 42:40.257
and then she still went with him.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.893
Mitch should've been
a knight in shining armour,

42:42.960 --> 42:46.797
but he got smashed, acted a prick
and fucked everything up.

42:46.864 --> 42:49.266
(sobs)

42:52.703 --> 42:56.807
I feel so sorry for Charlotte.
She's built this up for so long,

42:56.874 --> 42:59.376
put so much pressure
on the whole situation,

42:59.443 --> 43:01.245
and it all went tits up for her.

43:01.312 --> 43:05.015
Oh, my God! I'm hanging there
like a puppet, looking like a twat.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.618
Cock.
I feel like an absolute wanker.

43:07.685 --> 43:09.853
(yells)

43:09.920 --> 43:12.589
If Scott's pulling girls,
I'm gonna pull boys.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.560
I still think Mitch was a dick
last night.

43:16.627 --> 43:19.530
I can't stay here
while I know they all hate him.

43:19.596 --> 43:21.131
Trying to resist Marnie now

43:21.198 --> 43:24.068
is one of the fucking hardest things
I have ever done.

43:24.134 --> 43:27.171
(sobs)
I feel completely heartbroken.

43:52.029 --> 43:52.229
.
