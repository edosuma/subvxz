00:02.160 --> 00:03.844
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.000 --> 00:07.607
The only thing stronger than your craving
for blood is your love for this girl.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.808
Your humanity is killing you.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.001
Turn it off!

00:12.160 --> 00:13.844
- What did you do?
- I fixed him.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.765
Fight for it. Feel something,
anything, Stefan.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.649
If you don't, you're gonna lose me.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.849
I've heard about you.
Crazy, impulsive vampire.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.089
- In love with his brother's girl.
- As long as Klaus is alive...

00:25.240 --> 00:26.321
I do what he says.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.569
What the hell did you do?

00:34.760 --> 00:35.966
He's earned his freedom.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.088
I had Klaus.
This could've all been over.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.480
We'll survive this.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.730
- We're never getting Stefan back.
- Then we'll let him go.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.081
- What now?
- Now I reunite my family.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.641
The people you cart around
in caskets?

00:48.800 --> 00:53.522
- What's the matter? Missing something?
- I'll kill you and everyone you've met.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.081
Do that and you will never
see your family again.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.764
Excuse me.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.882
Should have been watching
where I was going.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.240
- Don't worry about it.
- Have a nice day.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.765
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I'm totally paranoid all the time.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.760
You have a right to be. Klaus is out there,
and he knows you tried to kill him.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.691
Why hasn't he made a move?
There's been no sign of him, nothing.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.206
- Just my slow spiral into insanity.
- Join the club.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.287
Every time I close my eyes,
I have that nightmare on repeat.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.240
- The same dream?
- Four coffins, Klaus is in one of them.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.887
- It's weird.
- What if it's not just some dream?

05:01.080 --> 05:04.448
What if it's, like, you know,
a witch dream?

05:04.800 --> 05:07.485
It's just stress. I'll figure it out.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.041
What about Stefan?
Has there been any sign of him?

05:11.720 --> 05:13.643
He betrayed us, Bonnie.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.963
The Stefan that we knew is gone.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.248
How's Damon handling it?

05:20.680 --> 05:23.889
Damon is Damon.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.443
All right, you have your choice,
Bloody Mary, screwdriver...

05:28.600 --> 05:31.126
brunch in a bottle.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.328
Come on, Ric,
I can't drink this by myself.

05:36.520 --> 05:41.367
I mean, I can, but then
somebody's getting naked.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.643
Oh, man, I can't believe you're
making me drink alone.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.361
- I'm busy.
- It's the eve of Klaus-ageddon.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.921
- You're doing homework?
- This may come as a shock...

05:53.120 --> 05:55.771
but I am not here
to hang out with you.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.448
I'm here to see Jeremy,
who is an hour late for his shift.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.171
Kids today, where are their values?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.800
That's his midterm paper. Copied it
off the Internet, didn't try to hide it.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.930
- Ooh. Somebody's getting grounded.
- Did you say Jeremy...

06:13.080 --> 06:14.889
- ...as in Jeremy Gilbert?
- Yeah.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.247
He was fired last week.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.721
Oops.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.568
- Nice shot.
- Heh.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.245
What's the point of this again?

06:30.400 --> 06:33.882
The point is I'm pissed at Caroline
and Bonnie dumped your ass.

06:35.080 --> 06:41.486
- The point is to get drunk and shoot stuff.
- Profound.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.287
Alaric finds out I took this,
he's gonna use it on me.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.960
So, what's the deal with that?
He's, like, your guardian now?

06:50.120 --> 06:54.045
Sort of, yeah. I think he feels
responsible for us.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.090
- You like him?
- Yeah. Yeah, I like him.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.928
Hey, you wanna move out of the way?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.045
I'm a hybrid, Gilbert.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.761
You can't kill me unless you cutoff
my head or rip out my heart.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.890
And you're not gonna do it
with that lame-ass crossbow.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.802
Go ahead, take a shot.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.527
Unless you don't think
you can hit me.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.691
Jeremy, the minute that you get this,
call me.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.844
Unbelievable.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.050
- You're feisty when you're mad.
- It's not that I'm mad, I'm just worried.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.529
Why? He lost his job at the Grill?
I think he'll survive, Elena.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.923
He's spiraling. Ever since
Bonnie broke up with him...

07:49.080 --> 07:52.971
he's moody, and he's not
really talking to anyone.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.361
- Typical teenager.
- Who's seeing ghosts...

07:55.520 --> 07:57.761
and who lost everyone
that he cares about.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.649
Not everyone.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.610
He still has you.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.645
- You okay?
- What makes you think I'm not okay?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.888
Well, you're day-drunk.

08:12.040 --> 08:17.251
- It's not exactly your most attractive look.
- Oh. What is my most attractive look?

08:17.400 --> 08:18.640
Ah-ah.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.121
I'm not saying that you have
any attractive look.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.729
I'm just saying that this is
my least favorite one.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.807
Noted. I'll see if I can
make any improvements.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.485
Don't mind me.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.484
Klaus.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.563
Gonna do this in the Grill?
In front of everyone?

08:38.760 --> 08:41.650
- A little beneath you.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.849
I just came to my local pub
to grab a drink with a mate.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.362
Get a round, then, would you, Tony?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.766
Surprised you stuck around
long enough for happy hour.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.524
My sister seems to be missing.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.406
- Need to sort that out.
- Cute, blond bombshell, psycho?

09:00.600 --> 09:04.207
- Shouldn't be too hard to find.
- Truth is...

09:05.000 --> 09:10.609
I've grown to like your little town.
Thinking I might fancy a home here.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.164
I imagine you're wondering,
how does this affect you?

09:14.360 --> 09:16.408
The answer is, not in the slightest.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.040
As long as I get what I want
and everyone behaves...

09:19.240 --> 09:21.971
you can go on living your little lives
how you choose.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.880
You have my word.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.569
- What more could you possibly want?
- Well, for starters...

09:27.720 --> 09:29.529
tell me where I might find Stefan.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.365
Stefan skipped town
the second he saved your ass.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.682
Well, you see, that is a shame.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.800
Your brother stole from me. I need him
found so I can take back what's mine.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.563
That sounds like
a Klaus-and-Stefan problem.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.531
Well, this is me broadening
the scope, sweetheart.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.604
Hello, Bonnie.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.090
Stefan.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.850
- You followed me here?
- Yeah.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.447
Wasn't too hard.
You should probably be more careful.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.968
- What do you want with me?
- Relax. I just need your help.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.243
Why would I help you?
Elena said you saved Klaus' life.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.722
Let me fill you in on
a little secret about Klaus.

11:32.920 --> 11:37.244
He kept his family with him at all times.
Daggered, stored in coffins.

11:37.400 --> 11:42.361
And now I have them, and I need you
to help keep them hidden.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.966
You out of your mind?
You're gonna make him angrier.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.647
His family is his one weakness.
As long as I have that, I can ruin him.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.406
I don't have enough power
to hide four Originals.

11:51.600 --> 11:56.208
You're a witch, you hate Klaus.
I know you can figure something out.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.488
You ready?
- Vampires, hybrids and Originals?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.483
No problem.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.166
My rebellious brother? I'm worried.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.608
Proof you're still human.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.167
Just in time. We're cooking.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.361
- Sorry, just passing through.
- Oh. I thought we'd all stay in...

12:18.560 --> 12:22.121
have a meal together,
like a typical atypical family.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.327
Well, why?

12:23.480 --> 12:26.290
Maybe because you got fired
and you didn't tell anyone.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.925
Ugh. Look, can we do this later? I made
plans with Tyler. He's right outside.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.525
Wait.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.122
When did you start
hanging out with Tyler?

12:36.280 --> 12:39.727
- I don't know. Does it matter?
- Yeah, Jeremy, it matters.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.770
He was sired by Klaus.
He's dangerous.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.128
He can still hear you.
He's right outside.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.483
You are gonna lecture me on
who I can and can't hang out with?

12:48.640 --> 12:52.361
- What is with the attitude?
- Whatever. This is lame. Tyler's waiting.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.971
No. Oh, no, no, no. You're not going
anywhere, especially not with Tyler.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.442
I'm with her on this, Jer. Sorry.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.728
You want me to stay in?
Let's all stay in.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.882
- Yo, Tyler, come on in!
- Jeremy...

13:18.120 --> 13:20.566
I think it's about time
we had a drink, don't you?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.041
- I'd say we were overdue.
- You've been so busy...

13:23.200 --> 13:25.680
- ...with all your plotting and scheming.
- You know me.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.922
Never miss a chance to plan
an epic failure.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.571
Don't be so hard on yourself.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.007
Who could guess
your own brother would betray you?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.851
I did have a front-row seat
when your sister lied to you.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.008
Yeah, well, she's fickle, that one.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.560
And you say you have
no idea of her whereabouts?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.563
That's the thing
with younger siblings.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.927
You just never know what they're gonna do.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.921
Drink?

13:54.240 --> 13:57.403
- Thanks.
- This is weird.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.446
Klaus has hybrids stalking me,
now you're just sitting in our kitchen.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.763
- Look, maybe I should go.
- No, stay, you're not doing anything.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.447
Unless you have to, you know,
check in with your hybrid master.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.201
- It's not like that, Elena.
- Tell me, Tyler, ahem...

14:12.360 --> 14:16.445
what is the difference between
being sired and being compelled?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.649
Compulsion, that's just mind control.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.529
Like hypnosis.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.809
Being sired is...

14:27.600 --> 14:31.400
It's like faith. You do something
because you believe it's the right thing.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.406
So you believe that serving
Klaus is the right thing?

14:36.200 --> 14:40.808
I don't serve him. Klaus released me
from a curse that was ruining my life.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.291
I owe him for that.

14:42.480 --> 14:47.486
What if he asked you
to jump off a bridge?

14:47.640 --> 14:51.406
He wouldn't. And even if he did,
I'd be fine. I'm a hybrid.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.801
What if he asked you
to rip your own heart out?

14:54.640 --> 14:55.721
Again, he wouldn't.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.247
- What if he did?
- Then I'd rip out my heart.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.208
You guys sound like Caroline.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.966
Getting freaked out over something
you don't understand.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.011
You're right, Tyler, I don't understand.
Klaus has terrorized every one of us...

15:10.160 --> 15:13.243
- ...and you're blindly loyal to him.
- You're overthinking it.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.689
I can still make my own decisions.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.410
- Cheers, mate.
- Down the hatch.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.847
We've actually got
a lot in common, you and I.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.841
Really? Heh.

15:38.040 --> 15:43.649
Well, yeah, maybe we can bond
over our mutual loathing of my brother.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.365
Why are you so mad at him?
He stole something?

15:48.520 --> 15:50.522
My family, the Originals.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.561
I had them daggered, boxed up, awaiting
the day when I saw fit to wake them...

15:54.800 --> 15:56.802
and he went in
and pinched the bloody lot.

15:58.200 --> 16:03.331
Of course he did.
Ah, such a buzz-kill, my baby bro.

16:04.440 --> 16:10.482
Well, I'd love to find him. Trouble is,
I sure as hell don't work for you.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.528
You know, your drink stinks of vervain.
So I can't compel you.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.011
There's no point killing you.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.806
You're the one with the most hope
of getting what I need.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.083
And yet it would seem
a demonstration is in order.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.087
Perhaps I wasn't clear enough
when I told you to find Stefan.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.247
Oh, well. It seems you people
respond best to displays of violence.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.088
Why don't you take this
as an example of my reach?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.606
There he is.

16:42.760 --> 16:47.448
So that thing I told you to do. Why
don't you go ahead and get on with it?

16:53.840 --> 16:56.207
- What was that about?
- It was nothing.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.126
I gotta go.
Um, thanks for the food offer, but, uh...

17:03.280 --> 17:04.406
Next time.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.119
Well, that was illuminating.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.650
So Tyler Lockwood is a lunatic
who has access to our house.

17:19.800 --> 17:25.967
I mean, this whole
sire-bond thing is wild.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.966
I don't think Tyler is aware of what little
reason lies behind what he's saying.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.565
It's like cult logic.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.805
Well, great. That's a wonderful
influence for you, Jer...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.331
Jeremy?

17:40.640 --> 17:41.971
That's his ring.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.810
Where'd he go?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.170
Jeremy?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.649
What is he doing?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.849
- Oh, my God.
- Jeremy!

17:57.280 --> 17:58.770
Jeremy!

17:58.920 --> 18:00.331
Jeremy, move!

18:24.960 --> 18:26.928
There I go again, bumping into people.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.203
- He's gonna be all right. Are you okay?
- I don't understand.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.647
Who was that on the phone earlier?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.409
It was Klaus.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.969
You were compelled, Jeremy.
We've gotta get him inside. Help me.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.365
Compel the men to open up this wall.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.490
We need sun.
I want a fortress, not a dungeon.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.321
- There he is, the man of the hour.
- So everything went okay?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.448
Tony ran down Alaric
instead of Jeremy...

19:05.600 --> 19:08.046
but apples, oranges.
Message lands the same.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.207
- You said you were sending a warning.
- And I did, an effective one.

19:12.360 --> 19:16.046
Elena's family suffers, she's
motivated to get me what I want.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.363
I didn't think we'd actually
have to kill anyone.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.050
Tyler, mate, what you're feeling is
the remnant of a guilty conscience.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.000
I need you to get over it, okay?
End of the day...

19:30.160 --> 19:35.564
human life is just a means to an end.
Our means to our end.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.961
You'd do well to remember that.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.766
- How is he?
- He's dead, but he had his ring.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.082
Klaus' hybrid hit him.
Now we just wait.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.207
Jeremy, why aren't you wearing vervain?
Where's your bracelet?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.920
- I don't know.
- It was Tyler. It had to have been.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.289
That's why he was hanging out with you,
to get you off the vervain.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.169
Klaus is trying to send a message.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.642
He wants us to find Stefan,
who stole coffins full of his dead family.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.007
- Coffins?
- Yep.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.369
All we have to do is find four coffins
and voilÃ ...

20:16.520 --> 20:18.887
no one else has to die.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.328
Wait, that's your big plan?
To steal back four dead Originals...

20:22.480 --> 20:25.165
so this hybrid doesn't kill me
and everyone we know?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.800
- Got a better idea?
- Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.167
- Pack our bags and go.
- Jeremy, calm down.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.004
No, I'm not gonna calm down, Elena.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.481
This happens every time,
no matter what we do.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.281
I mean, you get on my case
about school and work. Who cares?

20:38.440 --> 20:41.444
None of us are gonna make it
out of this town alive.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.921
He said he wants his family back.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.525
No. I know what you're thinking.
The answer is no.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.001
- If we give him Rebekah...
- Klaus undaggers her.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.926
First thing she does is kill you.
Frying pan, fire, not an option.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.366
Klaus' coffins.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.967
How many did you say there were?

21:10.440 --> 21:13.489
- Elena, hey.
- Klaus is looking for four coffins.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.325
Just like in your dream.
Guessing it's not just stress.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.051
Elena, don't get involved.
Whatever Klaus wants...

21:19.200 --> 21:22.443
<i>- ...stay as far away as you can.
- Klaus won't let me. Bonnie...</i>

21:22.600 --> 21:24.204
he tried to kill Jeremy.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.965
- What do you want me to do?
- We need to find Stefan.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.966
Look, I know that you don't think
your locator spell still works...

21:35.120 --> 21:37.441
but we have to at least try.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.210
We don't need a locator spell.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.002
- Bonnie said this place lost its mojo.
- The dead witches were angry...

21:45.160 --> 21:49.210
for bringing Jeremy back. Now they
have something they want her to know.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.809
That's why I hate witches.
So fickle, and passive-aggressive.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.721
- Stefan?
- Come on, Stef. Olly olly oxen free.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.643
Really? sun?

22:05.080 --> 22:07.811
- What?
- The witchy spirits aren't a big fan.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.163
And they use their juju
to screw with my daylight ring.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.084
- Well, then wait outside.
- Elena...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.686
I'm not leaving until I know
if he's here.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.484
Stefan?

22:29.600 --> 22:31.409
Go away.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.045
<i>You shouldn't be here, Elena.</i>

22:37.200 --> 22:38.725
<i>Stefan, I need your help</i>

22:38.880 --> 22:42.566
- Bonnie said that you would be here.
- Well, Bonnie sucks at keeping secrets.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.087
Listen, you need to give Klaus
his family back.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.811
Oh, really? Is that what I need to do?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.964
Klaus compelled Jeremy
to stand in front of a speeding car.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.805
Don't you get it?

22:54.960 --> 22:57.531
Stefan, he's not gonna stop
until he gets what he wants.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.920
Elena, stop talking.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.127
I'm not giving Klaus anything.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.761
Are you listening to me?

23:04.920 --> 23:06.490
He's gonna kill Jeremy.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.042
Not really my problem.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.009
Then you can go to hell.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.491
- That didn't go over well.
- Don't even start, Damon.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.847
- Let me talk to him.
- You can't get in.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.650
The witches won't let you.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.970
Here.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.690
Take my car keys.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.242
You go deal with your brother,
I'll deal with mine.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.761
Wow.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.969
That was impressive.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.246
But the coffins aren't here, so...

24:11.400 --> 24:15.769
- ...you can go away now.
- I don't care about the coffins.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.964
We need to talk.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.766
Ow!

24:22.920 --> 24:24.001
Okay.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.888
Let's talk.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.245
Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.528
That is for screwing up my plan.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.163
You stopped me from killing Klaus
and you steal his family. Why?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.482
- Doesn't make sense.
- Aah!

24:52.640 --> 24:54.608
- Answer me!
- Argh.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.531
Piece by piece,
Klaus took everything from me.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.245
I'm doing the same to him.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.051
- But I had him, Stefan!
- Aah!

25:02.200 --> 25:05.329
- Why'd you screw it up?
- I did it to save you.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.644
What?

25:11.080 --> 25:14.766
No. No way.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.606
- You didn't do this for me.
- He was one step ahead of us.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.081
If Klaus died,
his hybrids would have killed you.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.251
When are you gonna get it through
your head?

25:25.960 --> 25:27.450
Stop saving me.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.763
- Don't do it, Jeremy.
- Why not?

25:37.960 --> 25:40.406
You stab my back, I stab yours.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.649
- I didn't stab you in the back.
- That why you wanted to hang out?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.928
- To get me off the vervain?
- Klaus asked me to.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.651
- I never thought he'd try to kill you.
- It's Klaus.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.485
- What'd you think was gonna happen?
- He doesn't care.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.961
All he wants is to get his family back.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.927
- What the hell?
- Whenever Klaus wants something...

25:58.080 --> 25:59.809
someone ends up dead.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.328
You think about that next time
before you blindly do whatever he says.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.283
Jer. You should get home, stay inside.

26:13.360 --> 26:17.251
Klaus isn't gonna stop
until he gets all those coffins back.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.329
He's not done with you.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.120
Ric, hey.
When did you return to the living?

26:32.280 --> 26:34.965
Oh, just a few minutes ago.
How's Jeremy?

26:35.640 --> 26:39.725
Hating me. Hating life. Hating the fact
that we can't have a family dinner...

26:39.880 --> 26:42.281
without somebody dying
before dessert. You okay?

26:44.640 --> 26:47.450
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh. Something's wrong.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.285
- The ring. Unh.
- Ric. Hey.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.684
- What happened?
- He got hit by a car.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.043
- And he's coughing up blood.
- Get his vitals.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.361
- Pulse, thready and weak.
- Internal bleeding.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.045
- Get him out of here.
- Let's move.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.248
Let's not and say we did.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.449
Why don't you two
meet us at the hospital?

27:07.640 --> 27:09.130
What?

27:09.280 --> 27:12.727
No. No, no, no, wait. No, wait.
You have to help him.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.650
- What are you doing?
- You can still save his life, Elena.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.370
Here, take my blood.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.688
I can't get in.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.969
- You're gonna have to invite me.
- Why are you doing this?

27:28.160 --> 27:30.731
Klaus asked for his family.
You didn't deliver.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.563
Ric. Oh, my God. I'm right here. Hey.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.563
He's gonna die.
- Hey, look.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.406
Might wanna invite me in, Elena.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.201
- Jeremy.
- He's not dead yet.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.009
Where are you going?

28:05.800 --> 28:07.723
What are you doing?

28:15.680 --> 28:17.205
Now he's dead.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.962
We've gotta get Alaric
to the hospital now.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.005
You know what I can't figure out?

28:41.480 --> 28:42.766
Why save me?

28:43.320 --> 28:47.166
Is it brotherly love? Guilty conscience?
Does it switch on, does it switch off?

28:47.320 --> 28:48.970
You have somewhere
you need to be?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.924
Oh, deflection.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.805
- Not gonna work on me, I invented that.
- We're done.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.370
- Can't you go away?
- Not until you tell me why you saved me.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.046
- You owe me that.
- I don't owe you anything.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.851
Fine.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.321
Why'd you steal the coffins?

29:05.480 --> 29:08.324
Klaus' family is one weakness
I can use against him.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.290
To do what? You're not gonna
kill him. Know how I know?

29:11.440 --> 29:14.523
There was only one way to kill him
and you blew that to save me.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.842
You're wrong, Damon.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.368
Klaus doesn't get to just live forever.
There's another way.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.170
There has to be.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.724
Fair enough.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.169
Whatever you're doing, I want in.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.648
- I don't need your help.
- Last I checked...

29:29.800 --> 29:32.565
- ...you were hiding in a haunted house.
- I'm in this alone.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.371
You go after Klaus,
you have to be cutthroat and devious.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.205
I'm so much better at that than you.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.882
Come on, brother.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.645
What do you say?
If you're gonna keep saving my life...

29:44.840 --> 29:47.047
at least make it for a good reason.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.211
You want in, huh?

29:50.360 --> 29:52.203
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.886
But it's just me and you.
Elena stays out of it.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.361
- Deal.
- Follow me.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.771
Well, I'm not so welcome in there.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.730
Don't you worry, Damon.
We all want the same thing.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.363
Have a look.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.571
What?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.051
Klaus is allergic to dust?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.087
Look again.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.926
Witch spirits hate Klaus
as much as we do.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.367
They're using their powers
to hide the coffins.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.366
- So even if he comes in the house...
- He won't be able to find them.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.445
<i>Dr. Slogan to the ER. Dr. Slogan to the ER.</i>

30:37.840 --> 30:39.365
Mr. Saltzman.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.927
What are you doing up?
You should be resting.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.448
Uh, well, I'm more of a walk-it-off
kind of guy.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.765
Ahem. Do I need to sign something?

30:47.920 --> 30:51.766
Internal hemorrhaging, three broken
ribs and a severe concussion.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.082
I have no idea
how you're on your feet...

30:54.240 --> 30:58.086
- ...but I need to run some tests.
- I actually have some place I need to be.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.651
But thank you, doctor...

31:00.560 --> 31:02.403
Fell.

31:02.960 --> 31:06.282
But the patients who follow my advice
get to call me Meredith.

31:07.960 --> 31:12.807
Well, uh, I appreciate your help, Dr. Fell.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.286
Mr. Saltzman, what is your secret?

31:20.120 --> 31:22.487
Guardian angel or did you sell your soul
to the devil?

31:25.960 --> 31:27.121
A little of both.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.650
Thank you for coming.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.164
I trust you have news of Stefan.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.927
I couldn't find him.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.369
But I have something else.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.162
My poor sister.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.007
I can't turn my back on her
for a moment.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.322
You have Rebekah.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.681
A deal is a deal.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.845
The life of my sister in exchange for
your brother? I'd say that's a bargain.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.690
Consider him spared.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.684
You should know.
I was the one that daggered her.

32:17.840 --> 32:22.084
- When she wakes, she'll come after me.
- I can control Rebekah.

32:23.240 --> 32:26.528
Besides, I still need your help
finding Stefan.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.411
I told you, I don't know where he is.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.201
You're lying.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.727
Fortunately, you have no shortage
of loved ones.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.565
If I don't find my family,
you should be asking...

32:40.720 --> 32:43.200
who's gonna die next?
Bonnie? Caroline?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.281
Damon?

32:49.680 --> 32:53.287
It's only a matter of time
before Stefan gives me what I want.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.041
He doesn't care about me anymore.
You made sure of that.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.130
You turned him into a monster.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.040
Now he's your problem.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.242
And just so you know...

33:10.000 --> 33:12.924
I'm not the only one
Rebekah wants dead.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.243
She knows
what you did to your mother.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.526
She knows that you killed her.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.568
You can let yourself out.

33:40.040 --> 33:43.044
So the ring brought you back to life,
but it didn't heal you.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.170
- Does that mean it's broken?
- I don't know.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.322
It's never happened like that before.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.087
I guess I have Damon's blood to thank
for the fact that I'm still walking.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.847
- He said to say you owe him a drink.
- Heh. That's funny.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.447
Rather have head trauma.
Hey, Jeremy.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.050
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

34:04.640 --> 34:07.883
I shot a hybrid in the back and chopped
his head off with a meat cleaver.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.241
Typical Sunday, huh?

34:11.679 --> 34:14.364
You can talk to me about this stuff.
You know that, right?

34:14.520 --> 34:17.444
What could you tell me
that I don't already know?

34:18.199 --> 34:24.731
This is the way things are. It sucks,
but I just gotta get used to it.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.281
Did you get rid of him?

34:40.440 --> 34:44.001
Yeah. Tony the headless hybrid
is now at the bottom of Steven's Quarry.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.844
- What about Alaric?
- Took care of him too.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.650
He'll be fine.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.567
How are you?

34:50.719 --> 34:54.121
I think I got most of the blood
off the porch.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.289
Elena.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.451
Look at me.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.444
It's gonna be okay.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.405
I have to tell you something.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.082
I, uh, made a deal with Klaus.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.607
- I gave him Rebekah.
- What?

35:15.800 --> 35:18.451
No, no, no. You did not do that.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.369
She's gonna come here and kill you.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.841
She won't. Klaus won't let her.
He needs me.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.571
- And suddenly you trust him?
- No, I don't trust him.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.722
But what other choice do I have?

35:28.240 --> 35:30.288
I don't trust Stefan.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.441
You think he's just gonna give up
the coffins?

35:35.560 --> 35:39.485
My brother's sort of running
his own show right now.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.047
Yeah, my brother just chopped off
someone's head.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.123
It's not right.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.131
It's not fair. He's 16 years old.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.089
He shouldn't have to live like this.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.129
Elena.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.007
There has to be another way.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.641
We have to fix it.

36:01.440 --> 36:02.885
We will. Hey.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.924
Elena.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.723
Hey.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.329
We will.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.125
Okay?

36:23.720 --> 36:25.245
Here we are, Rebekah.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.241
Home, sweet home.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.281
It only took a thousand years.

36:32.640 --> 36:36.804
And to think I was counting on you
being here with me.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.847
But that's all ruined now, isn't it?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.682
I'm so sorry.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.164
Sister.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.688
We'll meet again one day.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.966
Hey. Can we talk?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.771
Uh, yeah, what did I do now?

37:26.360 --> 37:29.204
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.249
About how we should pack up and go.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.722
- Elena, I didn't mean any of that.
- But you were right.

37:34.880 --> 37:39.408
You shouldn't have to give up
a normal life just because of me.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.562
- What's going on?
- Your sister thinks...

37:41.720 --> 37:43.882
we should have another one
of our talks.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.641
Here's the thing, Jer.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.961
You're gonna go out of town
for a while.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.011
A long while.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.609
You're gonna stay with
some nice family friends in Denver.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.128
You're gonna be at a new school.
Gonna meet new girls.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.964
Living girls.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.841
You're gonna drink a few beers,
take an art class, whatever you want.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.243
Tell him he's gonna leave
Mystic Falls behind.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.051
And never think twice about it.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.923
You're gonna leave Mystic Falls behind
and never think twice about it.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.685
You're gonna have
a better life, Jeremy.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.201
This is the one I dreamt about.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.490
Don't bother. Won't open.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.130
What do you mean? Is it locked?

38:59.280 --> 39:00.884
Nope. Just won't open.

39:01.040 --> 39:04.169
I've tried everything.
Blowtorch, ax, crowbar.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.523
- Can't even scratch the finish.
- I think it's closed with a spell.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.684
Meaning whatever's in there
should probably stay in there.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.968
You said
you wanted to make him suffer.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.322
The witches lead me here for a reason.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.847
I think whatever's in this coffin
is our answer.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.208
I feel like a horrible person.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.522
You just saved his life, Elena.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.482
Take it from me, estranged is bad,
dead is worse.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.765
I can't stop thinking about what happened
the last time I asked you to compel him.

39:37.960 --> 39:42.045
He found out. And he got over it.
Again, not dead, Elena.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.530
He's so lucky to have you for a sister.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.921
Thank you.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.686
- No problem.
- Not just for this, Damon.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.444
For everything.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.971
I don't know what I would do
if you weren't here.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.160
You should know this, Elena.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.122
Stefan didn't screw us over.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.045
He screwed us over,
but he had a good reason.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.804
What?

40:20.600 --> 40:23.080
He saved Klaus to save me.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.526
And then he stole the coffins
to get even.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.523
Damon, if he did it to protect you...
Why would he even do that?

40:33.120 --> 40:36.044
- What does it even mean?
- What does it mean?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.447
Means I'm an idiot.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.685
Because I thought for one second that
I wouldn't have to feel guilty anymore.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.411
Wait, what are you talking about?
Guilty for what?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.609
For wanting what I want.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.966
- Damon.
- Oh, I know.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.485
Believe me, I get it.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.368
Brother's girl and all.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.321
No. No. You know what?

41:16.480 --> 41:20.849
If I'm gonna feel guilty about something,
I'm gonna feel guilty about this:

41:45.800 --> 41:47.370
Goodnight.
