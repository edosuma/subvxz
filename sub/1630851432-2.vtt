00:20.478 --> 00:24.441
Somewhere in this town
is my mom's hidden diary.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.652
Hopefully it will tell us
what to do with this necklace.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.572
So, what else did
this letter from your mom say?

00:30.655 --> 00:33.450
Maps, amulets, hidden diaries, witches…

00:33.533 --> 00:35.535
I mean,
some pretty weird stuff is happening.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.372
Um, I don't know
how to tell you guys this--

00:39.456 --> 00:41.791
Wait! Look! Up in the corner!

00:42.500 --> 00:47.297
"X-o-beeth-n-i-caj?"

00:49.924 --> 00:51.134
Wait! Look in the mirror!

00:51.968 --> 00:55.221
"Jack in the… box."

00:55.305 --> 00:56.347
Jack-in-the-box!

01:05.607 --> 01:08.151
Look! On the map! Main Street.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.279
That must be our first clue.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.285
You need to find a key
That will come in parts of three!

01:17.368 --> 01:19.704
-Whoa…

01:19.788 --> 01:22.749
And be prepared
For many exciting surprises!

01:22.832 --> 01:27.128
The key you seek will dissolve
Before the full moon rises!

01:27.212 --> 01:28.463
-Wow…

01:28.546 --> 01:30.590
That monkey just talked to us.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.802
-See? Weird things are happening!

01:36.262 --> 01:39.474
"The key you seek will dissolve
Before the full moon rises"

01:39.557 --> 01:41.768
Before the full moon rises.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.728
Tonight is the full moon!

01:44.270 --> 01:47.649
That means we need to find her diary
before the moon comes out tonight.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.985
Well then, we better hurry.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.697
It looks like they've got
some kind of map.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.242
-And a talking monkey?

01:57.325 --> 02:00.120
-No, no, no, no, no!

02:00.662 --> 02:04.457
The idea of those little girls
getting to that witch diary,

02:04.541 --> 02:06.918
oh, it really upsets my stomach!

02:07.001 --> 02:10.922
Ah, a classic case of diary-arhea.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.632
Really, Wilma? Really?

02:12.715 --> 02:14.134
I thought it was funny.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.804
If they get the witch book, they'll learn
how to use the powers of the amulet,

02:17.887 --> 02:21.933
and if they learn how to use the powers of
the amulet, we all know what that means.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.519
Cancellation of
our Centipede-of-the-Month food club.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.854
Witch, please!

02:25.937 --> 02:30.275
-We have an amulet to steal!

03:26.789 --> 03:28.249
This looks like the spot.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.461
Remind me again why we're trusting
clues from a monkey-in-a-box?

03:31.544 --> 03:32.712
Because he's really cute?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.513
Knock knock! It's clue o'clock!

03:42.597 --> 03:45.308
I have hundreds of legs but only can lean

03:45.391 --> 03:47.977
Dirt and dust are mine to clean

03:48.061 --> 03:50.396
You better hurry or you'll run out of time

03:50.480 --> 03:53.608
The answers you seek are next to the nine!

03:55.860 --> 03:57.195
Toodles!

03:57.779 --> 04:00.406
"I have hundreds of legs
But only can lean?"

04:00.490 --> 04:02.575
Hundreds of legs…

04:03.076 --> 04:04.244
Hm….

04:04.327 --> 04:06.371
Oh, is there a marathon today?

04:06.913 --> 04:09.582
I've got it! A marathon…

04:10.708 --> 04:11.542
for janitors!

04:17.799 --> 04:21.344
Nine o'clock? But it's only two p.m.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.266
"The answers you seek
Are next to the nine"

04:32.021 --> 04:33.147
"Broom emporium."

04:35.191 --> 04:36.401
Yes! Brooms!

04:36.985 --> 04:40.154
Hundreds of legs, dirt and dust…
This is it.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.781
Hm…

04:43.199 --> 04:46.035
Looks like they're headed
toward One-Whisker Pete's.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.414
Uh, we can't go there.
That place is for good witches only.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.166
Like that's ever stopped us before.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.502
Fink. Sneak. You guys stay here.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.838
-Wilma, let's fly!

04:56.921 --> 04:57.755
Oh!

05:00.133 --> 05:00.967
Wanda!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.846
Wait for me!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.318
-Hello?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.028
Hello?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.112
Is anyone here?

05:21.779 --> 05:25.783
Does anyone else find it odd
that there isn't anyone working here?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.080
-Maybe he's the shopkeeper.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.999
Oh my fur and whiskers!

05:33.082 --> 05:34.876
-The day has come!

05:34.959 --> 05:38.212
I've been waiting for you. Come in!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.590
Right this way, you three!

05:42.216 --> 05:45.386
-Is this a test?
-We'd have to be cats to fit through that.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.139
Did somebody say cats?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.934
I knew this would come in handy.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.605
The hiding potion. Great idea!

06:04.906 --> 06:06.199
Not to poop on the party,

06:06.282 --> 06:10.161
but are we sure we want to follow
that cat through that weird gnome door?

06:10.244 --> 06:12.455
Yeah, what if this is a trap?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.874
My mom wanted us
to come here for a reason,

06:14.957 --> 06:17.085
and there's only one way to find out why.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.002
Come on!

06:19.087 --> 06:20.755
Here, kitty kitty kitty!

06:24.717 --> 06:26.552
-No way!
-Unbelievable!

06:26.636 --> 06:28.346
What is this place?

06:28.429 --> 06:32.809
Oh my gosh, you guys. A secret,
tiny, cat-sized magic shop!

06:32.892 --> 06:37.230
It's like something out of a fairy tale.
Are you the owner?

06:37.313 --> 06:38.815
I'm One-Whisker Pete, and--

06:38.898 --> 06:42.151
Well, I used to be, but my whiskers
have all grown back. Anyways!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.278
I-I-If you need it, I got it.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.325
Brooms, potions,
wands, crystals, you name it!

06:49.408 --> 06:51.911
I see
you're already set for hiding potion.

06:51.994 --> 06:55.289
Not a potion you see much these days,
but it is a tricky bit of brewing.

06:55.373 --> 06:59.377
What's the deal with this hiding potion?
Why do witches hide as cats?

06:59.460 --> 07:05.633
You ever wonder why where there's a witch,
there's always a cat too?

07:05.716 --> 07:10.721
Witches learned long ago that
it was best to simply hide in plain sight.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.348
Wow.

07:12.431 --> 07:17.979
A cat-only entrance also keeps any normals
from walking in off the street.

07:18.062 --> 07:22.400
If only it would keep
those evil witches from popping in on me

07:22.483 --> 07:23.860
like they own the place!

07:23.943 --> 07:25.319
-Now.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.323
Let's get down to business, girls.
You'll probably want your hands for this.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.451
I hope this works.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.077
When our hiding's said and done

07:33.161 --> 07:35.371
Return the forms that we came from

07:36.998 --> 07:37.957
Whew!

07:38.458 --> 07:42.295
By the way, these are my best friends,
Scout and Lucy. And I'm--

07:42.378 --> 07:43.754
Willa Ward!

07:43.838 --> 07:45.882
Oh, I know about you.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.508
Yeah. I knew your mother.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.179
-Woah…

07:52.096 --> 07:55.141
Since you're here,
that means you must be on the quest

07:55.224 --> 07:57.685
for the key to your mother's magic book.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.818
Woah…

08:07.695 --> 08:08.529
Wow!

08:08.613 --> 08:13.284
She made you this special broom
for if this day ever came.

08:13.367 --> 08:17.121
My mom made me a quilt and
your mom made you a flying broom?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.333
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

08:20.416 --> 08:24.921
Actually, I am.
And I've never ridden a broom before.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.508
Well, I have once. Kind of.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.511
Terrific! Then this should be easy.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.263
Let the broom take you
where you're meant to go!

08:34.347 --> 08:37.934
And a word of advice, uh,
you may want to lose the backpack.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.648
Thanks.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.656
What's happening? Where am I going?

08:55.117 --> 08:56.744
Where is this taking me?

09:01.415 --> 09:06.712
Wow. You really didn't want your diary
in the wrong hands, did you, Mom?

09:11.592 --> 09:14.971
-Hello? Anybody home?

09:15.054 --> 09:16.806
Aw, it's those witches again.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.765
Yoo-hoo!

09:17.848 --> 09:18.933
Quick! Hide!

09:19.016 --> 09:21.102
Don't make a sound!

09:21.644 --> 09:22.478
The table!

09:27.900 --> 09:31.112
What's the weird on the street,
One-Eyed Pete?

09:31.195 --> 09:34.740
One-Whisker Pete. Look, I have two eyes.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.619
The whiskers thing is a very funny story,
though it was seven mystical moons--

09:38.703 --> 09:39.704
Yeah, sure, whatever.

09:39.787 --> 09:44.000
Speaking of eyes, have you
happened to see, oh, I don't know,

09:44.083 --> 09:45.710
three cute little girls walk by?

09:45.793 --> 09:50.715
Oh, not that I'd tell you, but no.
Now, I suggest you leave.

09:50.798 --> 09:56.721
If there are no little girls around,
how come I smell little-girl stench?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.306
Mind if we check in the back?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.685
Perfect!

10:06.856 --> 10:12.153
Children? Hello, little girls! Anybody?

10:18.075 --> 10:20.828
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times,

10:20.911 --> 10:23.664
this shop is for good witches only!

10:25.583 --> 10:29.879
Now, kindly leave
before I turn you both into toads!

10:29.962 --> 10:33.799
We're not afraid of you, but the girls
aren't here anyway. Let's split.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.596
I hope Willa's okay.

10:38.679 --> 10:42.224
-Woah! Where am I going?

10:54.987 --> 10:57.239
-A willow tree.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.034
Just like Mom.

11:07.750 --> 11:12.922
Just because you are mine
doesn't make you a witch.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.759
Believing in magic does.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.569
The first piece of the key!

12:20.322 --> 12:24.243
Not to brag or anything,
but I rode that broom like Harry Potter.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.585
-I got the first part of the key!
-I knew you could do it, Willa.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.338
-We're so glad you're okay.
-The witches were looking for you.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.007
How did they know where we were?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.970
-There goes another one of my nine lives.
-Zappo!

12:45.306 --> 12:46.140
Thanks!

12:53.939 --> 12:55.691
Just the box?

12:55.774 --> 12:56.859
Anything to add?

12:56.942 --> 13:00.446
Some people love it
And some people fear it

13:00.529 --> 13:03.991
But you won't learn a thing
If you never go near it

13:05.201 --> 13:06.035
School!

13:06.619 --> 13:07.620
Come on!

13:07.703 --> 13:10.247
Toodles toodles, hunky doodles!

13:18.130 --> 13:20.382
It's locked.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.635
I guess it is a Saturday.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.971
So…

13:26.639 --> 13:28.516
Who wants to be a cat-burglar?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.353
This cat thing is so awesome.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.942
What are they up to now?

13:47.117 --> 13:48.702
Willa! Scout! Lucy!

13:48.786 --> 13:52.915
-How did you get in here?
-Hi, Ms. Juniper!

13:52.998 --> 13:54.583
Funny meeting you here.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.377
Well, Willa, it is my classroom,

13:56.460 --> 13:59.004
and if you students
handed your assignments in on time,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.590
I wouldn't be spending
my Saturday playing catch-up.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.592
Sorry, Ms. Juniper. We're just visiting--

14:03.676 --> 14:04.927
Oh, I know why you're here.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.721
You do? You knew
Willa's mom sent us on this wild…

14:07.805 --> 14:10.808
-…magical treasure hunt, and two witch--

14:10.891 --> 14:11.892
Nothing!

14:12.476 --> 14:13.602
We're just visiting.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.229
Were you about to say witches?

14:15.312 --> 14:16.313
-No.
-No.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.943
Yes, you were! I knew it!

14:21.026 --> 14:24.530
I knew it when I saw your new necklace.
You three are witches, right?

14:25.573 --> 14:26.407
No.

14:26.991 --> 14:31.328
Uh, wait… You're not a witch, are you?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.539
Don't tell me Piggy can talk.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.916
Although, at this point,
I wouldn't be surprised.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.420
No, I'm not. Unfortunately.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.840
And Piggy can't talk. I don't think.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.012
-Ah, darn.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.932
But I am a leading witchstorian.

14:53.142 --> 14:57.229
Yeah. So if you ever need any help
with anything to do with magic,

14:57.313 --> 15:00.608
I am your out-of-the-ordinary
extraordinary resource.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.068
Well…

15:03.152 --> 15:05.779
-Can you tell me what this is?
-Oh, yes.

15:05.863 --> 15:11.493
Willa, this amulet appears
in many witchstory books.

15:11.577 --> 15:16.123
This special charm has been the source of
many battles between good and bad witches.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.958
I mean, for centuries.

15:18.459 --> 15:22.421
-And now it's mine. Wow.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.174
How about this?

15:27.301 --> 15:30.930
Well, I'll be.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.895
This has been in the lost and found
for years, and I could never open it,

15:37.978 --> 15:40.481
but I always thought
maybe I should hang on to it.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.690
I guess I know why now.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.859
Wow! Thank you!

15:47.154 --> 15:48.113
Woah.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.539
Magic in action?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.541
Best. Day. Ever!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.127
I guess we gotta go. See you soon!

16:02.211 --> 16:05.714
Oh! Okay, well, uh, yeah.
I'll be right here if you need me.

16:05.798 --> 16:10.052
Really anything to do with magic, I--
Did I mention I'm a leading witchstorian?

16:10.135 --> 16:12.471
-Where's it going?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.391
This is so cool!

16:17.518 --> 16:18.352
Here!

16:22.815 --> 16:23.983
Where's it going?

16:32.992 --> 16:37.329
"793.08."

16:38.122 --> 16:39.498
What kind of clue is that?

16:40.165 --> 16:43.711
Of course. We're in a library.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.588
Come on, it's the indexing system.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.466
-School is in session!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.677
Can we stop
at the cafeteria first?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.637
No. Open the door.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.234
793.08.
It's somewhere in these books.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.278
Look for something that doesn't belong.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.245
Well, that's definitely not very magical.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.205
What's a yearbook doing here?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.375
A ribbon.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.756
Mom?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.138
Woah.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.808
The handle of the key!

17:40.851 --> 17:43.145
-Oh, girls?

17:43.228 --> 17:46.023
Oh no. How do they
always know where we are?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.608
-They're witches!

17:49.234 --> 17:50.861
-Hide!

17:52.529 --> 17:55.074
I can smell them here.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.451
-Where are they? Smell harder!

17:59.578 --> 18:03.791
-Girls! Hello?
-Quick! Come on!

18:09.963 --> 18:11.590
Go, go, go!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.892
Those kids are smarter than we thought.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.561
I'm gonna go check the cafeteria.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.318
-We gotta get out of here!

18:33.695 --> 18:36.031
-Poof, a clue!
-Every time!

18:37.825 --> 18:42.037
"A bright light divides the night
The last piece you seek will be found

18:42.704 --> 18:48.460
One puzzle remains where wisdom's the game
In a place where you run out of ground"

18:48.544 --> 18:50.337
-The ocean!
-What?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.631
A place where you
run out of ground. The ocean!

18:53.215 --> 18:55.217
Lucy, you're right! Let's go.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.565
The light that divides the night…

19:10.274 --> 19:11.108
Hm.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.113
The old lighthouse!

19:16.196 --> 19:18.782
-The light that divides the night!
-Hurry!

19:20.409 --> 19:23.495
-Quick! Before the moon rises!
-Hurry!

19:35.090 --> 19:36.091
My mom and dad!

19:45.434 --> 19:49.229
"When the light shines on
My greatest earthly treasure

19:49.313 --> 19:52.608
The last piece of the key
Will be yours with my pleasure"

19:56.653 --> 19:57.613
Over there!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.492
Come on!

20:13.003 --> 20:16.340
-The light! It's here!

20:21.762 --> 20:22.888
Look everywhere!

20:23.805 --> 20:26.475
-Do you guys see anything?
-I can't find anything.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.145
The clue said the lamplight
would shine on her greatest treasure.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.859
Woah! Willa, it's you!

20:38.528 --> 20:40.197
You're her greatest treasure!

20:46.245 --> 20:48.914
-Wow!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.378
-The key!

20:54.461 --> 20:56.004
-We did it!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.096
Nice one, witch sister!

21:06.265 --> 21:07.349
Hey, guys?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.601
I have to tell you something.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.315
My mom was a-- Well--

21:15.399 --> 21:16.817
A witch?

21:21.488 --> 21:24.574
And the worst kind of witch, too.
A good witch!

21:26.034 --> 21:28.829
All you were good for was
leading us to her amulet.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.247
-So…

21:30.330 --> 21:34.042
Hand it over and
we'll hand over your little friends.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.051
Get over here!

21:43.135 --> 21:45.512
-Stay still!

21:46.847 --> 21:49.057
Okay. Deal.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.477
It's in this special box.
I'm keeping it safe.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.187
Willa.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.899
Don't do it.
Your mom will never forgive you.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.902
We will sacrifice ourselves!

22:00.986 --> 22:04.239
No. I must do this.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.119
Well,
that wasn't so hard, was it?

22:09.202 --> 22:13.040
Run away before we
turn you into crustaceans!

22:13.123 --> 22:15.500
-We got it!

22:19.588 --> 22:23.091
I'm sorry I didn't just
come right out and tell you guys that…

22:23.175 --> 22:24.760
That your mom was a witch?

22:24.843 --> 22:27.012
-It was obvious, right?
-You think?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.264
I mean, she made you a flying broom.

22:29.931 --> 22:33.018
We figured we'd talk to you
about it when you were ready.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.479
And, you know,
when witches weren't chasing us.

22:37.355 --> 22:40.442
I thought you guys
wouldn't want to be my friends anymore

22:40.525 --> 22:42.235
if you knew I had a witch for a mom.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.280
Are you kidding?
My mom's a dental hygienist.

22:45.363 --> 22:46.782
Everyone's afraid of her.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.368
So we're still friends?

22:50.452 --> 22:53.121
Duh! And even better, we're wisters!

22:53.205 --> 22:56.792
We fly on brooms, turn into cats,
we have cotton candy chairs.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.628
I don't have any other friends
more fun than that.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.463
And even without all those things,

23:01.546 --> 23:04.841
we're besties and
we'll love you no matter what.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.555
Now we just have to
figure out what this key is for.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.770
Woah.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.402
Where is it going?

23:31.201 --> 23:32.202
-Woah!

23:37.999 --> 23:38.875
Woah.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.715
This must be my mom's secret witch stuff.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.512
Wow!

23:54.891 --> 23:56.768
Oh this is good, yes!

23:56.852 --> 24:03.525
Time to open the box and
get my hands on our pretty little amulet,

24:03.608 --> 24:07.696
and then we'll put an end
to good witches everywhere!

24:07.779 --> 24:08.905
Can I hold it?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.618
Yes, sister. You may hold it.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.541
-Surprise!

24:24.254 --> 24:26.089
Look at all this stuff!

24:26.173 --> 24:28.758
-Potions!
-Wands!

24:28.842 --> 24:30.552
This is so cool!

24:37.767 --> 24:39.060
My mom's witch book!

24:39.936 --> 24:41.855
We did it! We found it!

24:45.525 --> 24:50.280
"There be witches good and bad
With powers to make the world happy or sad

24:50.363 --> 24:53.200
With this book of spells you decide

24:53.783 --> 24:54.868
To dance in the light

24:55.452 --> 24:57.078
Or in shadows to hide"

25:10.675 --> 25:11.509
Wait…

25:12.219 --> 25:13.720
Does this mean--

25:13.803 --> 25:15.096
You're a witch too?

25:18.642 --> 25:19.684
Wow.
