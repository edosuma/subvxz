part TWO

01:39.317 --> 01:42.775
Jacquelyn, could you bring
the Baudelaire file in here, please?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.608
Hello, my name is Lemony Snicket,

01:47.692 --> 01:50.692
and I'm sorry to say that
the alleged entertainment you are watching

01:50.775 --> 01:52.483
is extremely unpleasant.

01:54.567 --> 01:57.900
Jacquelyn, could you bring
the Baudelaire file in here, please?

01:57.983 --> 02:01.192
From the beginning of this miserable tale
to the last melancholy scene,

02:01.275 --> 02:04.483
I cannot think of a single line,
a single word,

02:04.567 --> 02:07.108
that does not chill me
to my deepest bones.

02:08.733 --> 02:11.650
Jacquelyn, could you bring
the Baudelaire file in here, please?

02:14.650 --> 02:17.817
However, the sad history
of the Baudelaire orphans

02:17.900 --> 02:22.025
did not begin in the private,
somewhat ill-decorated office of Mr. Poe

02:22.108 --> 02:24.275
at Mulctuary Money Management.

02:26.150 --> 02:29.358
Jacquelyn, could you bring
the Baudelaire file in here, please?

02:34.817 --> 02:38.233
Nor does their story begin on this gray
and cloudy morning at Briny Beach,

02:38.317 --> 02:40.567
<i>where the Baudelaire children,
Violet, Klaus and Sunny,</i>

02:40.650 --> 02:42.358
<i>received terrible news.</i>

02:42.442 --> 02:45.817
Your parents have perished
in a terrible fire.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.942
In fact, the tale of the Baudelaire
orphans begins long before the fire

02:49.025 --> 02:52.525
<i>which left the children
with practically nothing to their names.</i>

02:52.608 --> 02:56.900
Their story begins before their brief
and unpleasant stay with the Poe family.

02:56.983 --> 02:59.483
It begins before the children
meet Justice Strauss,

02:59.567 --> 03:02.400
<i>a nice lady who, unfortunately,
is not their guardian.</i>

03:02.483 --> 03:06.150
And before the Baudelaire orphans were
placed under the care of a terrible actor

03:06.233 --> 03:08.483
<i>with a mysterious tattoo of an eye
on his ankle,</i>

03:08.567 --> 03:11.275
<i>who made the Baudelaires
sleep in an awful room,</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:14.817
do a series of difficult
and irritating chores,

03:14.900 --> 03:19.525
<i>and cook dinner for his disreputable
and largely untalented theater troupe,</i>

03:19.608 --> 03:23.233
resulting in an act of violence
that ought not to be shown on-screen.

03:25.692 --> 03:26.817
"Why?" you may ask.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.358
Why did the Baudelaire orphans suffer
through this series of unfortunate events?

03:30.442 --> 03:33.317
How did the resourceful
and intelligent children

03:33.400 --> 03:38.025
of kindly and attentive parents
end up in the care of Count Olaf?

03:40.067 --> 03:42.608
That answer, at least,
can be found shortly after the fire

03:42.692 --> 03:44.775
that claimed the Baudelaire home.

03:47.608 --> 03:51.525
Inside the private,
somewhat ill-decorated office of Mr. Poe

03:51.608 --> 03:53.692
at Mulctuary Money Management.

03:56.942 --> 04:00.067
Jacquelyn, could you bring
the Baudelaire file in here, please?

04:07.275 --> 04:09.858
Do you know what the question
I'm asked most is?

04:09.942 --> 04:11.192
"Will you please leave the premises?"

04:12.150 --> 04:13.442
"Why do I do it?"

04:13.525 --> 04:16.608
"Count Olaf," they ask me,
"why are you an actor?

04:16.692 --> 04:20.233
Why not a model, or a millionaire playboy?

04:20.317 --> 04:27.025
Why respond to the siren song
that the Spanish call <i>'El Teatro'</i> ?"

04:27.108 --> 04:28.525
- For fame and fortune?
- No.

04:28.608 --> 04:29.608
For standing ovation?

04:29.692 --> 04:31.150
- No.
- For the costumes!

04:31.233 --> 04:35.358
Where are the costumes?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.817
Nobody brought the costumes?

04:53.150 --> 04:54.692
Stay in the car.

04:54.775 --> 04:56.150
Can we listen to the radio?

04:56.233 --> 04:57.317
No.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.150
Well, we've got to reach them.
Try Peru.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.567
Well, keep trying.
Yes, it's an emergency.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.275
I'm keeping an eye on things
best I can, but...

05:27.692 --> 05:28.775
Let me call you back.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.400
- I have an appointment.
- Name?

05:40.192 --> 05:41.192
Haircut.

05:42.692 --> 05:47.983
- Haircut?
- Yes... sica Haircut is my name.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.400
Yessica Haircut?

05:49.483 --> 05:52.983
Yes. Yessica.

05:55.358 --> 05:59.025
<i>Jacquelyn, could you</i>
<i>bring the Baudelaire file in here, please?</i>

06:19.317 --> 06:21.067
There are many police inspectors,

06:21.150 --> 06:23.442
concerned citizens
and television executives

06:23.525 --> 06:25.067
who have expressed confusion

06:25.150 --> 06:29.275
as to how the Baudelaire orphans ended up
in Count Olaf's so-called care.

06:29.358 --> 06:31.692
The scene you see behind me
is called a flashback.

06:31.775 --> 06:32.942
That is a word which here means

06:33.025 --> 06:35.775
"taken place during the events
of the last episode,

06:35.858 --> 06:37.775
shortly after the Baudelaire fire

06:37.858 --> 06:41.608
and during the Baudelaire children's
unfortunate stay with the Poe family."

06:41.692 --> 06:45.525
I present it to you now
in the hopes that the police inspectors,

06:45.608 --> 06:47.775
concerned citizens
and television executives

06:47.858 --> 06:49.817
might finally leave me alone.

06:51.567 --> 06:52.983
Hello, banker man.

06:53.817 --> 06:56.233
The Baudelaire fire
is precisely why I'm here.

06:56.317 --> 06:58.567
- File, not fire.
- I said file.

06:59.358 --> 07:00.442
Allow me to introduce myself,

07:00.525 --> 07:03.275
because, as you can see from my mole,
we've never met before.

07:03.358 --> 07:06.150
As you can see from my coat,
hat and ascot,

07:06.233 --> 07:07.483
I'm here on business.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.733
And as you can see from my sunglasses...

07:10.650 --> 07:11.650
it's bright out.

07:12.858 --> 07:15.192
I'm here to consult with you
on the Baudelaire will,

07:15.275 --> 07:17.483
for which I understand
you are the executioner.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.608
Executor.

07:18.692 --> 07:23.025
Person who controls people's fortunes
after a terrible fire has just happened.

07:23.775 --> 07:24.775
My name...

07:32.525 --> 07:35.358
is Yessica Haircut.

07:35.858 --> 07:37.025
That's strange.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.608
I have an appointment
for a haircut right now.

07:40.692 --> 07:42.775
Jacquelyn, please cancel that haircut.

07:42.858 --> 07:44.192
Mr. Poe, there's an urgent matter...

07:44.275 --> 07:47.358
No, no. I wanna hear
what this man Haircut has to say.

08:06.525 --> 08:08.108
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

08:08.983 --> 08:10.317
Well, I don't know, Mr....

08:10.400 --> 08:11.733
- Count...
- Count?

08:12.942 --> 08:17.900
on me to tell you my name,
which is Mr...

08:17.983 --> 08:19.775
Yessica Haircut.

08:19.858 --> 08:23.900
Well, Mr. Haircut, the Baudelaire will
states very clearly what is to happen

08:23.983 --> 08:26.692
in the event of the untimely deaths
of Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire.

08:26.775 --> 08:29.233
They are to be raised
by their closest living relative,

08:29.317 --> 08:32.150
who appears to be
a renowned scientist by the name of...

08:32.232 --> 08:35.525
It is one thing to listen to science,
Mr. Banker Man...

08:35.607 --> 08:37.150
- Poe.
- It is another

08:37.232 --> 08:39.607
to listen to the advice of a consultant.

08:39.692 --> 08:44.733
And in my important
actual consulting expertise business,

08:44.817 --> 08:47.942
the phrase "closest living relative"
can mean only one thing...

08:48.858 --> 08:50.108
"whoever lives nearby."

08:50.192 --> 08:52.483
Really? You think so?

08:54.733 --> 08:56.567
I would stake my fortune on it.

08:56.650 --> 08:59.567
Or my name's not whatever it is
I told you it was.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.608
Well, in that case,
we're going to need a map of the city.

09:03.650 --> 09:07.692
I think the person nearest
to the Baudelaires is renowned actor

09:07.775 --> 09:10.650
and handsome man, Count Olaf.

09:10.733 --> 09:11.775
Count...

09:12.775 --> 09:13.858
Never heard of him.

09:15.317 --> 09:18.442
He's been favorably mentioned
in theatrical reviews

09:18.525 --> 09:20.358
in several small magazines.

09:20.442 --> 09:23.442
His name is pronounced...

09:24.317 --> 09:25.858
Count Olaf.

09:25.942 --> 09:29.942
And if I'm not mistaken, he lives right...

09:31.233 --> 09:32.483
right here.

09:33.192 --> 09:34.275
Is that really the closest?

09:34.358 --> 09:36.192
Yes, absolutely, for sure.

09:37.067 --> 09:39.900
Jacquelyn, can you please
bring in a very large ruler?

09:46.067 --> 09:47.317
Jacquelyn?

09:51.567 --> 09:53.983
Guess I'll get it myself.

09:59.442 --> 10:02.150
These events
at Mulctuary Money Management

10:02.233 --> 10:05.233
resulted in unfortunate events
far and near,

10:05.317 --> 10:07.483
from a woman trapped in a remote park...

10:07.567 --> 10:09.567
You'll never get away with this.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.650
I already did get away with it.

10:14.525 --> 10:16.775
to three orphans
in horrifying circumstances,

10:16.858 --> 10:18.525
as our story resumes.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.650
Put some elbow grease into it!

10:22.692 --> 10:26.608
Mr. Poe must have made
a horrible mistake when he took us here.

10:26.692 --> 10:29.025
There's no way our parents
would want us in Count Olaf's care,

10:29.108 --> 10:30.275
if we can even call it that.

10:30.358 --> 10:33.567
As soon as Count Olaf's back is turned,
we need to leave this house.

10:33.650 --> 10:36.108
I'd rather take my chances on the streets
than stay here any longer.

10:36.192 --> 10:38.025
Who knows what would happen to us
on the street?

10:38.108 --> 10:39.817
At least here we have a roof
over our head.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.858
I wish our parents' money
could be used now,

10:41.942 --> 10:42.983
instead of when you come of age.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.942
Then we could buy a castle and live in it

10:47.025 --> 10:50.275
with armed guards patrolling outside
to keep out Count Olaf and his troupe.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.400
- With a large inventing studio.
- And a library.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.000
And chewable objects.

10:55.150 --> 10:58.025
Hurry up, orphans.
There's reupholstering to be done.

10:58.108 --> 11:00.150
Justice Strauss said
her home was always open to us.

11:00.233 --> 11:03.025
She said her legal library
was always open to us.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.233
It's not the same thing.

11:04.317 --> 11:07.233
Mr. Poe did say we could contact him
if we had any questions.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.650
We don't really have a question.
We have a complaint.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.400
Can I warm that up for you?
And also give you some very bad news?

11:13.483 --> 11:15.067
- What is it?
- It's that secretary...

11:15.150 --> 11:18.192
Shh! Not here.

11:35.525 --> 11:37.192
An emergency?

11:37.275 --> 11:39.233
Very well, but I'm quite busy.

11:39.317 --> 11:41.733
My old secretary,
a distinguished professional

11:41.817 --> 11:44.483
who showed up without fail
for many years, has vanished.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.358
I've hired an underemployed artist
with no prior experience

11:47.442 --> 11:50.233
who needs the occasional day off
for auditions and performances.

11:50.317 --> 11:53.858
Plus, I've already had to reschedule
a haircut several times.

11:53.942 --> 11:54.983
What can I do for you?

11:55.067 --> 11:57.733
Count Olaf is a madman.
We can't stay with him.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.442
He struck Klaus across the face.
See his bruise?

12:00.525 --> 12:03.900
Oh, excuse me. Poe here.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.567
Yes.

12:06.650 --> 12:08.442
Yes.

12:08.525 --> 12:10.067
Yes.

12:10.150 --> 12:11.608
Yes.

12:11.692 --> 12:13.067
Yes.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.942
Absolutely not.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.108
Thank you.

12:17.025 --> 12:18.358
I'm sorry. What were we talking about?

12:19.108 --> 12:20.358
Oh, yes, Count Olaf.

12:20.442 --> 12:22.983
I'm sorry you don't have
a good first impression of him.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.067
He only provided us with one bed.

12:25.150 --> 12:27.608
He makes us do
a great many difficult chores.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.360
He's a lush!

12:30.692 --> 12:33.317
Excuse me. Poe here.

12:34.150 --> 12:35.733
Seven.

12:35.817 --> 12:37.400
Seven.

12:37.483 --> 12:39.108
Seven.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.567
Seven.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.608
Anything but seven.

12:42.692 --> 12:43.775
You're welcome.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.483
Children, everyone,
at some time in their life,

12:47.567 --> 12:48.775
wishes they were being raised

12:48.858 --> 12:50.942
by people different than the ones
who were raising you.

12:51.025 --> 12:52.067
When I was a little boy,

12:52.150 --> 12:55.067
I would have given my eyeteeth
to be raised by an actor.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.858
He calls us orphans.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.108
You are orphans.

12:58.192 --> 12:59.483
He has terrible friends.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.358
I have terrible friends.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.040
He's clearly after our fortune.

13:04.775 --> 13:07.192
Speaking of not understanding
a word someone is saying!

13:11.150 --> 13:14.233
Baudelaires, are you familiar
with the term <i>"in loco parentis"?</i>

13:14.317 --> 13:15.650
It sounds like Latin.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.483
Latin and legal.

13:17.567 --> 13:21.858
<i>"In loco parentis"</i> means
"acting in the role of a parent."

13:21.942 --> 13:24.442
It is a legal term
and it applies to Count Olaf.

13:24.525 --> 13:27.025
The actor is acting as your parent.

13:27.108 --> 13:28.358
And as your legal guardian,

13:28.442 --> 13:31.233
Count Olaf may raise you
using any method he sees fit.

13:31.317 --> 13:34.358
So I'm sorry if your parents didn't
make you do household chores,

13:34.442 --> 13:37.525
or if you like their friends
more than you like Count Olaf's friends.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.692
But there are certain things
you must get used to.

13:39.775 --> 13:43.275
Now, I'm sorry
if I have to usher you out posthaste,

13:43.358 --> 13:44.942
but I've got work to do.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.317
"Posthaste" means "very, very... "

13:46.400 --> 13:47.983
It means he'll do nothing to help us.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.900
Oh, on the contrary, I'll have
my new secretary give you a ride home

13:50.983 --> 13:52.733
as soon as he's finished
typing up that report.

13:56.775 --> 13:58.483
I think we need to call the IT guy.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.150
That man works for Count Olaf.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.567
He did say Count Olaf
was one of his professional contacts.

14:02.650 --> 14:04.275
It was good seeing you, Baudelaires.

14:04.358 --> 14:06.275
We're not going back
to Count Olaf's house!

14:06.358 --> 14:07.733
Look at Klaus' face!

14:07.817 --> 14:10.608
Oh, no, no, no, orphans.

14:12.358 --> 14:14.150
Look at mine.

14:16.192 --> 14:17.650
Shall I let them off the hook?

14:30.358 --> 14:33.192
I spent all morning
making these cupcakes for you.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.274
Thank you.
They're store bought!

14:35.275 --> 14:37.275
Aren't raspberries delicious?

14:37.358 --> 14:39.733
They were my favorite berry
when I was your age.

14:39.817 --> 14:41.358
But we're all different ages.

14:51.442 --> 14:53.442
I want to talk to you about something.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.358
I recently received a call from Mr. Poe.

14:58.442 --> 15:00.025
Is that so?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.150
I'm sorry Mr. Poe bothered you.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.525
I'm glad he did,

15:04.608 --> 15:08.317
because I want you three children to feel
more at home here,

15:08.400 --> 15:10.358
now that I am your father.

15:11.025 --> 15:14.942
As you know, I have been working hard
with my theater troupe,

15:15.025 --> 15:19.192
and I'm afraid
I may have acted a bit standoffish.

15:19.275 --> 15:21.567
The word "standoffish"
is a wonderful one,

15:21.650 --> 15:25.150
but it does not describe
Count Olaf's behavior toward the children.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.567
"Standoffish" refers to a person

15:27.650 --> 15:30.317
who, for various reasons,
is not associating with others.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.692
It is a word which might describe
somebody who, during a party,

15:33.775 --> 15:36.942
might stand in a corner
instead of talking to another person.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.858
Gustav? Jacquelyn here.

15:57.942 --> 15:59.525
It would not describe somebody

15:59.608 --> 16:01.775
who provides one bed
for three people to sleep in,

16:01.858 --> 16:05.233
forces them to do horrible chores
and strikes them across the face.

16:05.317 --> 16:06.317
Therefore...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.150
There are many words for people like that.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.858
...to make you feel
a little more at home here...

16:10.942 --> 16:12.900
But "standoffish" isn't one of them.

16:12.983 --> 16:16.442
I want you to participate
in my next play.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.067
Participate how?

16:19.650 --> 16:22.358
I'm...

16:27.692 --> 16:30.817
The play is called <i>The Marvelous Marriage,</i>

16:30.900 --> 16:33.525
and is by the great playwright
Al Funcoot.

16:33.608 --> 16:36.608
We will give only one performance,
this Friday night.

16:36.692 --> 16:41.358
It tells the story of a very handsome
and good-looking man, played by me.

16:41.442 --> 16:45.067
You, Klaus, and you, Sunny, will play
two cheering people in the crowd.

16:45.150 --> 16:48.233
But we're shorter than most adults.
Won't that look strange to the audience?

16:48.317 --> 16:49.525
You'll be playing two midgets.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.275
And what will I do? Build the sets?

16:55.192 --> 16:58.983
Build the sets? Oh, heavens, no.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.858
My sister is very good with tools.

17:01.942 --> 17:05.650
A pretty girl like you shouldn't be
working backstage.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.567
But I'd like to.

17:07.650 --> 17:10.650
Sunny, Sunny, Sunny...

17:10.733 --> 17:11.983
Violet?

17:12.067 --> 17:14.317
Violet, Violet, Violet.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.150
You will be playing
the young woman I marry.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.275
It's a very important role

17:20.358 --> 17:23.650
although you only have one line,
and I think you know what it is.

17:23.733 --> 17:24.942
I don't.

17:25.025 --> 17:27.692
No, no, no. It's "I do."

17:27.775 --> 17:30.150
Count Olaf...

17:30.233 --> 17:31.608
What did you call me?

17:33.983 --> 17:35.067
Father...

17:36.983 --> 17:40.067
I'm not sure I'm talented enough
to perform professionally.

17:40.150 --> 17:43.483
I'd hate to disgrace your good name
and the name of Al Funcoot.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.983
Plus, I'll be very busy the next few weeks
working on my inventions.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.025
And learning how to prepare roast beef.

17:52.192 --> 17:55.150
You will participate
in my theatrical performance!

17:55.233 --> 17:57.525
I would prefer it
if you participate voluntarily,

17:57.608 --> 17:59.983
but as I believe
Mr. Poe has explained to you,

18:00.067 --> 18:03.108
I can act <i>loco parentheses</i>.

18:03.192 --> 18:04.275
<i>In loco parentis.</i>

18:04.817 --> 18:06.192
<i>Poco De Laurentiis</i>.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.067
<i>In loco parentis.</i>

18:09.025 --> 18:13.150
The point is,
I can order you to participate,

18:13.233 --> 18:16.733
and you must obey.

18:22.983 --> 18:25.525
Now go talk to the woman in the wig.

18:26.275 --> 18:29.192
I can't stand looking at you anymore.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.817
You think he was trying to poison us
with those raspberries?

18:40.900 --> 18:41.900
He ate them all.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.275
Besides, Count Olaf is after the fortune
we will inherit.

18:44.358 --> 18:46.025
Killing us will do him no good.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.900
What good would it do to be in
a performance of <i>The Marvelous Marriage?</i>

18:54.317 --> 18:56.358
Marriage is like sharing
a root beer float,

18:56.442 --> 18:58.692
or agreeing to be the back half
of a horse costume.

18:58.775 --> 19:00.775
Even when it's happening onstage,

19:00.858 --> 19:03.108
you should only do it
with the people you love.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.442
I have never been married myself.

19:05.525 --> 19:09.150
I once desperately loved a remarkably
brave and bravely remarkable woman,

19:09.233 --> 19:11.650
who, when I asked her
if she would be my wife,

19:11.733 --> 19:14.733
found, for complicated
and unfathomable reasons,

19:14.817 --> 19:16.442
she could give me no answer.

19:16.525 --> 19:17.817
No answer.

19:23.525 --> 19:27.400
Baudelaires!
I'm so happy to see you.

19:27.483 --> 19:29.858
Are you here to continue your research?

19:29.942 --> 19:32.483
Actually, Justice Strauss,
we're here to research something else.

19:32.567 --> 19:33.858
Do you have any books on the theater?

19:35.817 --> 19:38.275
Ah, the theater.

19:38.358 --> 19:41.858
I see you're settling in
to having an actor for a guardian.

19:41.942 --> 19:43.983
I have quite the interest in theater,
you know.

19:44.067 --> 19:47.108
Learning lines
and curtseying for the audience

19:47.192 --> 19:49.817
and wearing costumes.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.442
I would give up every last wig
just to wear a costume.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.400
Justice Strauss,
do you have anything on local ordinances?

19:56.900 --> 20:00.400
Ah, local ordinances.

20:00.942 --> 20:03.108
Wait, are you sure?

20:03.192 --> 20:06.525
Even I don't like reading such books,
and I work at the High Court.

20:06.608 --> 20:10.942
I'm actually considering a career in law.
I find those books quite fascinating.

20:11.025 --> 20:13.025
Well, to each his own.

20:13.108 --> 20:14.983
There are countless types of books
in this world,

20:15.067 --> 20:18.150
which makes good sense because
there are countless types of people.

20:18.733 --> 20:22.442
Sunny, would you like to come with me
into the garden

20:22.525 --> 20:26.150
while your siblings tackle
all this reading?

20:26.233 --> 20:28.900
Klaus, what's happened to your face?

20:32.233 --> 20:33.942
We're trying to find out.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.025
Well, I do have a section on rashes.

20:37.108 --> 20:39.775
It's right next to Chinese cars.

20:50.525 --> 20:52.233
Isn't it beautiful, boss?

20:53.067 --> 20:55.567
No, no, no, it should be delicate!
Fetching!

20:55.650 --> 20:58.192
And a chiffon train rippling down
like... like...

20:58.275 --> 21:00.150
- Like a waterfall.
- Like an open wound.

21:00.233 --> 21:01.275
Exactly.

21:04.567 --> 21:09.567
<i># Here comes Count Olaf
A bit of a show off #</i>

21:09.650 --> 21:12.067
- What?
- Nothing else rhymes with Count Olaf.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.025
There are plenty of things
that rhyme with Count Olaf.

21:18.817 --> 21:20.733
- Hmm.
- Uh...

21:20.817 --> 21:23.025
- Hmm...
- Hmm...

21:23.108 --> 21:24.400
Rice pilaf!

21:25.108 --> 21:26.442
Got it.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.317
I just think,
even in changing context,

21:34.400 --> 21:37.775
that marriage is an inherently
patriarchal construction

21:37.858 --> 21:41.192
that is likely to further
the hegemonic juggernaut

21:41.275 --> 21:43.275
that's problematizing, uh...

21:43.358 --> 21:45.900
Hmm,
"nuclear.

21:45.983 --> 21:47.192
Nudism.

21:47.275 --> 21:48.483
Nugget.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.567
Nuptial."

21:51.650 --> 21:53.567
Uh-oh, gotta go.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.858
on the planet and...

21:57.942 --> 21:59.483
Are you leaving?

22:00.150 --> 22:00.983
Justice Strauss?

22:01.067 --> 22:02.483
Yes?

22:03.275 --> 22:04.733
May I ask you something?

22:04.817 --> 22:06.358
Certainly.

22:07.567 --> 22:09.900
Oh, there we go, sweet girl.

22:09.983 --> 22:11.400
Good.

22:11.483 --> 22:14.483
Yes, as one legal scholar to another?

22:15.442 --> 22:17.067
"The only nuptial requirements are

22:17.150 --> 22:20.150
a statement of active acquiescence
by both participants,

22:20.233 --> 22:22.650
utilizing <i>in loco parentis</i> if necessary,

22:22.733 --> 22:26.150
and the signing of an explanatory document
in the bride's own hand."

22:26.775 --> 22:28.192
Does that mean what I think it means?

22:28.275 --> 22:32.025
Well, I suppose it depends upon
what you think it means.

22:32.108 --> 22:35.275
It means you're going to be a star.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.917
Oy.

22:37.067 --> 22:38.233
Count Olaf!

22:38.317 --> 22:40.817
Please, call me your guardian actor.

22:40.900 --> 22:46.567
Justice Strauss, you are about to find
your drab, legal beagle existence

22:46.650 --> 22:50.400
transformed into something mind-blowing,
and yet extremely classy,

22:50.483 --> 22:53.817
when you become the exciting new face

22:53.900 --> 22:56.900
of the next Count Olaf production.

22:57.567 --> 22:58.983
You mean...

22:59.067 --> 23:03.817
You have got the star quality necessary
for a small walk-on role

23:03.900 --> 23:06.192
in Al Funcoot's new play.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.233
I've wanted to be an actress
since I was young.

23:09.317 --> 23:12.233
Although, my drama teacher told me
my chances were slim

23:12.317 --> 23:15.817
because of my posture,
and so I went into the law, but now...

23:15.900 --> 23:17.858
Now, you can see it.

23:17.942 --> 23:20.067
- The curtain rises.
- Curtain?

23:20.150 --> 23:22.400
- The audience applauds.
- Audience!

23:22.483 --> 23:26.692
And you walk onto stage,
dressed as a judge.

23:26.775 --> 23:29.275
- A judge!
- It's a very important part,

23:29.358 --> 23:30.817
although you won't be listed
in the program.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.233
You will stand in front of a very
handsome man, played by me...

23:35.317 --> 23:38.525
I get to share the stage with Count Olaf?

23:40.317 --> 23:44.983
while a stunningly-costumed bride,
played by Violet, stands beside me.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.400
You are so lucky, Violet.

23:46.483 --> 23:49.108
All my life I wanted to be a bride,

23:49.192 --> 23:52.733
but it seems all the men I meet
are intimidated by my law degree,

23:52.817 --> 23:55.108
or obsessed with model trains.

23:56.192 --> 23:57.817
A gorgeous...

23:58.942 --> 24:01.775
bridal dress of my own design...

24:02.692 --> 24:05.608
while you perform
the entire wedding ceremony,

24:05.692 --> 24:08.358
getting each and every word
exactly right,

24:08.442 --> 24:09.733
while we sign a document

24:09.817 --> 24:12.317
which you shall bring from city hall
for added realism.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
Justice Strauss, he's up to something.

24:14.483 --> 24:19.567
What I am up to is making
Justice Strauss' dreams come true.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.858
Oh.

24:20.942 --> 24:24.192
You will suddenly find yourself
in the enviable position

24:24.275 --> 24:27.400
of being a struggling actress
in middle age.

24:27.483 --> 24:29.275
It's almost too good to be true.

24:29.358 --> 24:31.733
It is. Justice Strauss, Count Olaf is...

24:31.817 --> 24:35.150
Count Olaf is welcoming you into his life

24:35.233 --> 24:38.525
by making you an important part
of this theatrical enterprise.

24:38.608 --> 24:41.900
Children, go. Go home.

24:42.817 --> 24:45.442
Spend some time with your new father.

24:53.733 --> 24:54.983
Carpe Diem!

24:55.067 --> 24:56.358
Seize the children!

24:56.442 --> 24:58.233
- Seize the day.
- I said day.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.483
Boss,

25:03.567 --> 25:06.067
I have three kinds of butter cream icing
here for you to sample.

25:06.150 --> 25:09.942
One's vanilla, one has a hint of nutmeg
and the other's a little lemony.

25:10.025 --> 25:11.650
I told you never to say that word.

25:12.817 --> 25:14.942
Take these orphans

25:15.025 --> 25:17.483
upstairs to their bedroom until Friday.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.025
I have no use for them until then.

25:19.108 --> 25:21.192
- Uh, except to cook dinner.
- We'll order takeout.

25:21.275 --> 25:24.067
We're gonna find out
just what you're up to, Count Olaf.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.150
We know you're just trying to steal
our parents' fortune.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.233
We're gonna prove it.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.525
Let me eat cake.

25:32.442 --> 25:33.567
Nice.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.692
Mmm.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.025
Oh, my!

25:41.900 --> 25:43.942
Get into your pajamas
and say your prayers,

25:44.025 --> 25:45.108
unless you're atheists.

25:45.192 --> 25:46.275
You can't just keep us in here.

25:46.358 --> 25:49.025
You know who always says that?
Prisoners.

25:49.108 --> 25:50.233
Listen to us. Count Olaf is...

25:50.317 --> 25:52.025
No, no, no, no.
You listen to me, little boy,

25:52.108 --> 25:53.567
and you listen very carefully.

25:53.650 --> 25:56.817
The only reason why
Count Olaf hasn't torn you limb from limb

25:56.900 --> 25:58.692
is because he hasn't gotten
a hold of your fortune.

25:58.775 --> 26:01.608
But you ask yourself this question,
all of you:

26:01.692 --> 26:05.942
What reason would he have to keep
you alive after he's got your money?

26:06.025 --> 26:09.108
What do you think will happen to you then?

26:17.192 --> 26:19.942
- This is terrible, terrible.
- Awful.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Ghastly.

26:21.108 --> 26:22.192
What's gonna happen?

26:22.275 --> 26:24.942
I don't know.
But I know what I'm gonna do.

26:25.025 --> 26:27.108
I'm gonna stay up all night with a book.

26:29.692 --> 26:32.067
<i>Klaus was not reading
for his own enjoyment,</i>

26:32.150 --> 26:35.150
<i>but to try to rescue his siblings
from a terrible predicament.</i>

26:35.775 --> 26:39.442
<i>The book was not at all interesting.
The book was long and difficult.</i>

26:39.525 --> 26:42.442
<i>He found himself reading
the same sentence over and over.</i>

26:42.525 --> 26:45.525
<i>He found himself reading
the same sentence over and over.</i>

26:47.650 --> 26:50.650
<i>By night's end,
Klaus had found out all he needed to know.</i>

26:51.400 --> 26:53.775
<i>His hopes rose with the dawn.</i>

26:57.650 --> 26:59.358
<i>Although, unfortunately...</i>

27:01.733 --> 27:03.692
<i>so did Count Olaf.</i>

27:08.983 --> 27:11.692
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in your room.

27:11.775 --> 27:14.900
I was in my room all night,
and I know what you're up to.

27:14.983 --> 27:17.400
Me? I'm just having my morning coffee,

27:17.483 --> 27:19.692
although I can't seem to find
the sugar bowl.

27:20.442 --> 27:21.858
"The only nuptial requirements are

27:21.942 --> 27:24.358
a statement of active acquiescence
by both participants,

27:24.442 --> 27:26.817
utilizing <i>in loco parentis</i> if necessary,

27:26.900 --> 27:30.525
and the signing of an explanatory document
in the bride's own hand."

27:30.608 --> 27:32.442
Let me give you a piece of advice.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.150
If you use fancy-pants words
first thing in the morning,

27:35.233 --> 27:37.150
you're going to end up a very lonely man.

27:37.233 --> 27:39.233
I figured out your scheme.

27:39.317 --> 27:41.108
You're not going to marry
Violet figuratively.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.400
You're going to marry her literally.

27:42.483 --> 27:44.067
Literally?

27:44.150 --> 27:46.817
That's outrageous. I... Wait.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.567
Literally? Literally.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.108
You don't know the difference

27:50.192 --> 27:52.150
between figuratively and literally,
do you?

27:53.108 --> 27:54.733
Uh...

27:56.567 --> 27:59.733
It is very useful, whether one is young
or in late middle age,

27:59.817 --> 28:03.150
to know the difference
between literally and figuratively.

28:03.233 --> 28:07.025
"Literally" is a word which here means
that something is actually happening,

28:07.108 --> 28:08.483
whereas "figuratively" is a word

28:08.567 --> 28:10.817
which means
it just feels like it's happening.

28:11.275 --> 28:13.900
If you are literally jumping for joy,
for instance,

28:13.983 --> 28:17.442
that means that you are leaping through
the air because you are very happy.

28:18.233 --> 28:21.442
I'm leaping in the air
because I'm very happy.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.358
If you are figuratively jumping for joy,

28:23.442 --> 28:25.942
it means that you are so happy
you could jump for joy,

28:26.025 --> 28:28.525
but are saving your energy
for other matters.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.900
I'm so happy I could jump for joy,

28:31.983 --> 28:33.817
but I'm saving my energy
for other matters.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.483
So literally would be an actual marriage,
whereas figuratively

28:37.567 --> 28:40.233
would be marrying her for the purposes
of theatrical entertainment.

28:40.317 --> 28:42.483
I knew that. I was testing you.

28:43.483 --> 28:45.983
If my sister says "I do"
and signs a piece of paper

28:46.067 --> 28:48.233
while Justice Strauss is in the room,
she's legally married.

28:48.317 --> 28:51.233
This play won't be pretend.
It'll be real and legally binding.

28:51.317 --> 28:55.192
I wouldn't marry your sister
if she were the last orphan on earth.

28:55.275 --> 28:59.275
A man like me can acquire
any number of beautiful women

28:59.358 --> 29:01.483
who don't complain
about doing their chores.

29:01.567 --> 29:02.650
What's in it for me?

29:04.067 --> 29:08.567
"A legal husband has titular and practical
control over any relevant fiduciaries,

29:08.650 --> 29:11.983
resulting in aggregate financial dominion
over any spousal holdings."

29:12.067 --> 29:15.442
I don't think a boy your age ought to be
using the word "titular."

29:15.525 --> 29:17.025
If you became Violet's husband,

29:17.108 --> 29:19.483
you'd gain complete control
over the Baudelaire fortune. But...

29:19.567 --> 29:23.025
"A prospective spouse must be
chronologically sound and appropriate

29:23.108 --> 29:26.733
in regards to the age of consent according
to prevailing community standards."

29:27.858 --> 29:31.108
My sister isn't old enough to get married,
even if she wanted to.

29:34.108 --> 29:36.150
Tell me, bookworm...

29:37.108 --> 29:41.025
can you name me a language
that was spoken by ancient Romans

29:41.108 --> 29:43.900
and is still spoken
by very irritating people today?

29:43.983 --> 29:46.650
- Latin.
- That's right.

29:46.733 --> 29:51.858
And can you translate the Latin phrase
<i>"in loco parentis"?</i>

29:51.942 --> 29:53.525
"Acting in the role of parent."

29:53.608 --> 29:54.983
That's right.

29:55.067 --> 29:56.442
And that's me.

29:56.525 --> 30:00.358
You see, Violet can get married
if she has the permission

30:00.442 --> 30:02.025
of her legal guardian.

30:02.567 --> 30:03.817
And she does.

30:04.525 --> 30:05.608
In fact...

30:06.150 --> 30:08.108
she has more than permission.

30:09.150 --> 30:12.317
She has enthusiasm.

30:14.317 --> 30:18.275
All the enthusiasm in the world won't get
us to participate in your horrible plot!

30:20.025 --> 30:21.150
Mr. Poe will hear about this.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.067
Your play will not be performed,
and you will go to jail!

30:25.400 --> 30:27.733
<i># Here comes Count Olaf #</i>

30:27.817 --> 30:30.942
<i># Throw the rice pilaf #</i>

30:31.025 --> 30:32.025
Excuse me.

30:32.108 --> 30:33.692
Sorry to interrupt, everyone,

30:33.775 --> 30:36.358
but that brave and clever boy
with the horrible glasses

30:36.442 --> 30:38.733
has just figured out our dastardly plan.

30:38.817 --> 30:40.108
Yes.

30:40.192 --> 30:42.358
Thanks to his stupendous library book,

30:42.442 --> 30:45.942
the orphans have achieved a grand victory
over our evil ways.

30:46.025 --> 30:47.192
- Oh, no.
- Whatever will we do?

30:47.275 --> 30:49.817
- I guess we will go to jail.
- For a very long time.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.567
I guess that proves
reading really is fundamental.

30:52.650 --> 30:53.900
Violet,

30:53.983 --> 30:58.108
do you think your booky little brother
is very brave and clever?

30:58.192 --> 30:59.692
His work speaks for itself.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.358
Count Olaf wants to marry you for real,

31:01.442 --> 31:03.983
while you and Justice Strauss
and everyone else thinks it's just a play.

31:04.067 --> 31:05.733
But I'm not old enough to get married.

31:05.817 --> 31:08.108
You can with the permission
of your legal guardian.

31:08.192 --> 31:09.650
<i>In loco parentis.</i>

31:09.733 --> 31:12.358
We have to get Sunny
and get out of this wretched place.

31:17.358 --> 31:18.942
- Sunny. Wake up.
- Sunny.

31:19.567 --> 31:22.567
- Where is she?
- Where is she indeed?

31:22.650 --> 31:24.817
It certainly is so strange
to find a child missing,

31:24.900 --> 31:27.150
and one so small, so helpless.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.442
When did you see her last?

31:29.858 --> 31:31.067
What have you done with Sunny?

31:31.150 --> 31:34.692
Here, Sunny, Sunny.
Where are you, girl?

31:36.400 --> 31:37.483
Did you hear that?

31:38.400 --> 31:40.108
It came from outside.

31:47.775 --> 31:48.692
Sunny?

31:50.775 --> 31:52.733
Oh, you're not looking
in the right place.

31:52.817 --> 31:56.608
For children who read so much,
you two are remarkably unintelligent.

31:57.275 --> 31:59.817
She's not here.

32:00.817 --> 32:03.525
Oh, don't look so down.

32:03.608 --> 32:06.858
I'd say things are looking up, up...

32:06.942 --> 32:08.150
up.

32:16.442 --> 32:17.525
Oh, no.

32:17.608 --> 32:19.983
- Let her go. She's done nothing to you.
- She's an infant.

32:20.067 --> 32:21.733
Well, if you really want me
to let her go, I will.

32:21.817 --> 32:24.650
But even a stupid brat like you
might realize that if I let her go,

32:24.733 --> 32:26.858
or more accurately,
if I have my comrade let her go...

32:26.942 --> 32:28.108
Hi.

32:28.192 --> 32:30.192
Sunny might not survive
the fall to the ground.

32:30.275 --> 32:31.650
That's a 30-foot tower,

32:31.733 --> 32:34.192
which is a very long way
for a very small person to fall,

32:34.275 --> 32:36.650
even when she's inside a cage.
But if you insist.

32:36.733 --> 32:38.650
- No, don't!
- Please, she's just a baby.

32:38.733 --> 32:41.233
We'll do anything, anything.
Just don't harm her.

32:41.317 --> 32:43.108
Anything? Anything?

32:43.192 --> 32:46.775
Would you, for instance,
consider marrying me

32:46.858 --> 32:48.567
during tomorrow night's performance?

32:48.650 --> 32:50.567
I would never, ever marry you.

32:51.192 --> 32:52.567
Hmm.

32:52.650 --> 32:53.983
Children...

32:54.067 --> 32:58.108
your sister is like a stick
behind a stubborn mule.

32:58.192 --> 32:59.650
My sister's not a stick.

33:03.483 --> 33:06.150
Any animal owner will tell you

33:06.233 --> 33:09.192
that a stubborn mule
will move toward the carrot

33:09.275 --> 33:11.775
because it wants the reward of food...

33:12.483 --> 33:14.025
and away from the stick

33:14.108 --> 33:18.858
because it wants to avoid
the punishment of rump pain.

33:18.942 --> 33:21.775
Likewise, you will do what I say,

33:21.858 --> 33:24.192
to avoid the punishment
of the loss of your sister.

33:24.275 --> 33:28.108
And because you want the reward
of a charming husband.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.942
Come now.

33:32.025 --> 33:34.192
Would it be so terrible to be my bride,

33:34.275 --> 33:37.233
to live in my house
for the rest of your life?

33:37.900 --> 33:39.733
You're such a lovely girl.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.525
After the wedding, I wouldn't dispose
of you like your brother and sister.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.442
If you let Sunny go...

33:50.858 --> 33:52.900
- I will marry you.
- Hmm.

33:53.525 --> 33:55.275
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

33:57.442 --> 34:00.692
I will let Sunny go
after tomorrow night's performance.

34:00.775 --> 34:04.108
Until then, she will remain
in the tower room for safekeeping.

34:04.192 --> 34:06.608
- That is all.
- You're a terrible man.

34:06.692 --> 34:08.817
I may be a terrible man,
but I have concocted

34:08.900 --> 34:11.400
a foolproof way of getting your fortune.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.650
What have you done?

34:54.858 --> 34:56.775
I wish I had an inventor here.

34:57.692 --> 34:59.442
I was thinking the same thing.

35:02.108 --> 35:03.608
- Gustav.
- Jacquelyn.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.858
- You came.
- You sent for me.

35:08.567 --> 35:11.233
Things are disastrous.
Everything's gone wrong.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.775
I thought so.

35:12.858 --> 35:15.942
Dr. Montgomery and I were expecting
the Baudelaire children days ago.

35:16.025 --> 35:17.733
Dr. Montgomery's supposed to be
their new guardian.

35:17.817 --> 35:20.358
That's what the Baudelaire parents wanted,
in case of fire.

35:20.442 --> 35:22.275
What went wrong?
Why haven't we seen them?

35:22.358 --> 35:24.733
Mr. Poe listened to the advice
of a consultant.

35:25.317 --> 35:28.817
A consultant? Dear God.
Why would anyone listen to a consultant?

35:28.900 --> 35:32.483
I'll give you a hint.
His name rhymes with rice pilaf.

35:33.650 --> 35:35.858
Are you free Friday night
to attend the theater?

35:35.942 --> 35:37.692
We might be able
to get things back on track

35:37.775 --> 35:39.358
without calling attention to ourselves.

35:39.442 --> 35:42.067
Of course.
But what shall we do until then?

35:42.733 --> 35:44.108
Could you cut these ropes for me?

35:48.358 --> 35:50.108
The children must be so frightened.

35:50.775 --> 35:52.275
We're all frightened, Gustav.

35:53.150 --> 35:55.358
Sunny must be so frightened.

35:55.442 --> 35:58.358
We're all frightened, Klaus.
You should get some sleep.

35:58.442 --> 36:00.858
- But you're dismantling my bed.
- Use Sunny's.

36:00.942 --> 36:03.608
You stayed up all last night trying
to find out Count Olaf's plot.

36:03.692 --> 36:04.900
It's my turn.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.233
I didn't help us.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.442
Yes, you did.
You just didn't finish the job.

36:14.358 --> 36:19.775
Remember when our parents
first brought Sunny home?

36:20.733 --> 36:22.650
She bit the doorknob off the nursery.

36:24.317 --> 36:25.567
Mother and Father...

36:26.650 --> 36:29.525
they made me promise
to always look after you two

36:29.608 --> 36:32.358
and make sure
you don't get into any trouble.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.150
Let me keep my promise.

36:56.275 --> 36:59.442
Having a brilliant idea isn't as easy
as turning on a light.

37:00.983 --> 37:04.608
<i>But just as a single bulb can illuminate
even the most depressing of rooms,</i>

37:04.692 --> 37:08.067
<i>the right idea can shed light
on a depressing situation.</i>

37:35.400 --> 37:36.900
<i>As inventing workshops go,</i>

37:36.983 --> 37:40.025
<i>Count Olaf's bathroom was small
and dimly lit.</i>

37:40.108 --> 37:43.817
<i>But the inventing area in Violet's mind
was large and bright...</i>

37:44.400 --> 37:47.150
and inside of it was everything
she needed.

38:02.025 --> 38:04.358
Oh, Olaf, that is perfect.

38:04.442 --> 38:06.775
It's so wonderful that,
in addition to your many talents,

38:06.858 --> 38:08.650
you have a marvelous eye for fashion.

38:08.733 --> 38:10.567
- Without being a sissy.
- Without being a sissy.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.400
What was that?

38:13.233 --> 38:14.733
I think what's-his-name is shaving.

38:14.817 --> 38:18.067
Right. Tell me if this is too much.
Baby's breath.

38:18.150 --> 38:19.775
I thought you were marrying the older one.

38:19.858 --> 38:21.400
No.

38:21.483 --> 38:23.900
No, sprigs of baby's breath
in Violet's hair.

38:23.983 --> 38:25.358
Oh!

39:06.358 --> 39:09.442
"The most beautiful thing
we can experience is the mysterious."

39:20.275 --> 39:22.817
"It is the source
of all true art and science."

39:43.358 --> 39:45.983
How pleasant that you could join us.

39:50.108 --> 39:51.192
What are you gonna do with me?

39:51.275 --> 39:53.233
- I said have a seat.
- No, you didn't.

40:11.775 --> 40:13.525
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Boss, it's me.

40:13.608 --> 40:14.817
<i>Who? Be specific.</i>

40:14.900 --> 40:16.733
Me. Your henchman with the...

40:16.817 --> 40:18.775
<i>- Hand problem? What do you want?</i>
- Yeah.

40:18.858 --> 40:22.358
Your blushing bride just climbed up here
to try and rescue the biting brat.

40:22.442 --> 40:24.108
<i>- Well, how'd she do that?</i>
- Oh, I don't know.

40:24.192 --> 40:26.983
<i>- Well, take a guess.</i>
- Um... Well, some sort of, uh...

40:27.067 --> 40:28.900
<i>- Some sort of what?</i>
- Uh, ropey thing.

40:28.983 --> 40:31.275
- It was a grappling hook.
- She says it was a grappling hook.

40:31.358 --> 40:33.067
<i>- Where'd she get a grappling hook?</i>
- I don't know, boss.

40:33.150 --> 40:34.275
<i>- She's mine.</i>
- No, yes, boss, of course

40:34.358 --> 40:35.483
I understand she's yours.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.067
<i>- Stay there. I'll be right up.</i>
- Uh... okay.

40:37.150 --> 40:38.567
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
- Over and out.

40:38.650 --> 40:40.733
<i>- Over? What is that supposed to mean?</i>
- "Over and out"?

40:40.817 --> 40:42.233
Oh, um...

40:42.317 --> 40:44.567
- I mean. I think it's...
<i>- It's what?</i>

40:44.650 --> 40:46.942
- It's kind of an... a, uh...
<i>- Kind of an a what?</i>

40:47.025 --> 40:49.608
- Walkie-talkie slang for goodbye.
<i>- Say that.</i>

40:49.692 --> 40:50.983
I'm sorry. Okay, fine. Yeah.

40:51.067 --> 40:53.858
<i>- Well, for God... See you soon.</i>
- Okay. Goodbye.

40:55.442 --> 40:57.358
Count Olaf is very displeased
with his bride.

40:57.442 --> 40:58.692
I'm not his bride.

40:58.775 --> 41:00.692
Oh, very soon you will be.

41:01.942 --> 41:05.358
Which means that I will soon be
your henchperson-in-law.

41:11.442 --> 41:14.650
You know, some people say
that the hardest job in the world

41:14.733 --> 41:16.108
is raising a child.

41:16.192 --> 41:19.983
But it is nothing compared to conceiving,
writing, directing, producing

41:20.067 --> 41:22.650
and performing
in a theatrical presentation

41:22.733 --> 41:25.483
for the purposes
of stealing their dead parents' fortune.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.317
It's a very difficult job,

41:27.400 --> 41:30.192
and I will not have
any orphans mucking it up.

41:30.275 --> 41:31.650
You'll never touch our fortune.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.067
Klaus...

41:36.192 --> 41:37.858
I'll touch whatever I want.

41:56.233 --> 41:59.567
When the sand runs out in the...

41:59.650 --> 42:01.150
um...

42:01.233 --> 42:02.900
whatchamacallit...

42:02.983 --> 42:05.775
your sister will be married to me.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.900
What happened? Why are we up here?

42:08.983 --> 42:11.733
Tried to rescue Sunny using an invention
of mine to climb up the tower.

42:11.817 --> 42:13.067
It's so high.
You must have been terrified.

42:13.150 --> 42:15.108
It's not as scary as the thought
of marrying Count Olaf.

42:15.192 --> 42:16.525
I'm sorry it didn't work.

42:16.608 --> 42:18.900
The invention worked fine.
I just got caught.

42:18.983 --> 42:20.567
We've got to rescue Sunny
and get out of here

42:20.650 --> 42:22.108
before the sand runs out of the hourglass.

42:26.525 --> 42:29.692
I didn't realize the sand went so quickly.
I bought it online.

42:29.775 --> 42:33.525
You're gonna need to flip it
a couple of times, like, okay?

42:33.608 --> 42:35.108
And don't touch the baby!

42:35.775 --> 42:38.317
- It's gonna be okay, Sunny.
- Just hang in there.

42:39.000 --> 42:39.833
Seriously?!

42:39.983 --> 42:42.108
It's okay.
He didn't mean it as a joke.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.858
Do you think you could invent something
to help us escape?

42:46.025 --> 42:47.317
Maybe.

42:48.275 --> 42:51.233
Do you think you could research a way
to get us out of the wedding?

42:51.317 --> 42:52.358
Maybe.

42:58.067 --> 43:01.483
I am certain
that over the course of your own life,

43:01.567 --> 43:03.358
you have noticed that certain rooms

43:03.442 --> 43:06.400
reflect the personalities
of the occupants.

43:08.192 --> 43:09.442
For instance...

43:10.150 --> 43:12.608
in my own lonely room, I have...

43:12.692 --> 43:15.275
gathered a collection of things
which are important to me,

43:15.358 --> 43:17.650
including all of my notes
on the Baudelaire orphans,

43:17.733 --> 43:20.775
a few crucial objects
that I have gathered in my travels

43:20.858 --> 43:22.025
and...

43:24.858 --> 43:26.567
a blurry photograph...

43:27.358 --> 43:30.817
taken a long time ago,
of a woman named Beatrice,

43:30.900 --> 43:34.733
which I look at from time to time
while writing this account

43:34.817 --> 43:37.525
from across what was once
a prominent theater,

43:37.608 --> 43:39.942
no more able to help the Baudelaires

43:40.025 --> 43:43.233
than the objects
they found in Count Olaf's tower room.

43:53.983 --> 43:56.192
If we had kerosene,
we could make Molotov cocktails

43:56.275 --> 43:57.858
with those old wine bottles.

43:57.942 --> 43:59.567
- What are Molotov cocktails?
- They're small bombs.

43:59.650 --> 44:02.067
If we throw them out the window,
we could attract attention.

44:02.150 --> 44:03.483
But we don't have any kerosene.

44:03.567 --> 44:06.275
If you don't say "I do" and you don't sign
the document with your own hand,

44:06.358 --> 44:08.483
then you won't be legally married.

44:08.567 --> 44:10.317
But then Olaf will drop Sunny
off the tower.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.692
Certainly would.

44:11.775 --> 44:14.692
Come, orphans.
It's time for the big event.

44:14.775 --> 44:16.775
My associate here...

44:16.858 --> 44:18.442
Hello, good to see you again.

44:18.525 --> 44:21.108
will stay with your sister
and we will be in constant contact

44:21.192 --> 44:23.733
with the use of these walkie-talkies.

44:23.817 --> 44:26.525
If anything goes wrong
during tonight's performance,

44:26.608 --> 44:29.150
your sister will be dropped to her death.
Shall we?

44:30.358 --> 44:33.108
- We'll be back soon, Sunny.
- Don't worry.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.960
Yeah Right.

44:37.025 --> 44:38.567
Come on.

44:46.317 --> 44:49.567
Count Olaf, Eleanora Poe,
from the <i>Daily Punctilio.</i>

44:49.650 --> 44:52.358
Taking the role of a handsome man
is certainly a brave choice.

44:52.442 --> 44:53.442
Is it a stretch for you?

44:53.525 --> 44:56.775
Well, as an actor, I think live theater
is a much more powerful medium

44:56.858 --> 44:58.192
than, say, streaming television.

44:58.275 --> 45:00.442
And how do you respond to rumors
that this whole production

45:00.525 --> 45:02.983
- is nothing more than an evil plot?
- Evil plot?

45:03.067 --> 45:05.692
The only evil plot going on
is the one you'll see on stage.

45:05.775 --> 45:07.233
Take your seats.

45:07.317 --> 45:08.983
- All right, curtain 8:00 p.m.
- Check.

45:09.067 --> 45:10.608
- Intermission, 9:15.
- Check.

45:10.692 --> 45:13.442
Act two, 9:30,
unless concession sales are strong.

45:13.525 --> 45:15.400
- Check.
- The wedding will be around 10:00 p.m.,

45:15.483 --> 45:19.233
followed by champagne toasts,
reception with cake and finger food,

45:19.317 --> 45:20.858
then the after-party at the Mexican place.

45:20.942 --> 45:21.983
Check.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.858
I'm just glad the Baudelaires
are adjusting to their new life.

45:26.942 --> 45:28.525
I had my doubts about Count Olaf,

45:28.608 --> 45:31.525
but now that I see he's putting
three young children in the theater,

45:31.608 --> 45:34.108
all my anxieties are put to rest.

45:37.358 --> 45:39.650
You two will stay right here
until the wedding scene.

45:39.733 --> 45:42.317
Any sort of funny business,
and it's curtains for your baby sister.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.358
You see, "curtains" means that your sister
will be dropped out of the window,

45:45.442 --> 45:47.817
but it's also a sort of play
on theatrical curtains.

45:47.900 --> 45:49.317
One minute to curtain.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.775
- You look great.
- Don't distract me with idle chatter.

45:51.858 --> 45:53.108
I'm trying to get into character.

45:53.192 --> 45:55.775
Now, Justice Whatever,
sit here until the wedding scene.

45:55.858 --> 45:59.900
Remember, you must use the exact
same wording you use in an actual wedding.

45:59.983 --> 46:01.525
Get it absolutely right.

46:01.608 --> 46:05.067
There's talent scouts in the audience
looking for new actresses about your age.

46:05.150 --> 46:07.567
Talent scouts! Oh, my!

46:10.942 --> 46:12.608
Justice Strauss, may we speak to you?

46:12.692 --> 46:16.400
Don't distract me with idle chatter.
I am trying to get into character.

46:17.900 --> 46:21.025
Change of plans. Sit here.
Don't distract her.

46:21.817 --> 46:23.942
Your better side.

46:24.025 --> 46:26.858
Rubber baby, baby, baby.
Rubber baby...

46:26.942 --> 46:28.900
Rubber baby, baby...

46:28.983 --> 46:30.775
Rubber baby, baby, baby.

46:30.858 --> 46:32.817
Rubber baby, baby, baby.

46:32.900 --> 46:34.942
- Rubber baby, baby, baby.
- Showtime.

46:35.025 --> 46:36.567
- All right, all right.
- All right, all right.

46:36.650 --> 46:38.400
- Rubber bubber... Baby bubber.
- Rubber bubber...

47:00.025 --> 47:04.108
Here I am,
literally standing at the edge of a pond.

47:04.192 --> 47:06.275
He's not literally standing
at the edge of a pond.

47:06.358 --> 47:09.025
He's figuratively standing
at the edge of a pond.

47:09.108 --> 47:13.400
What is a very handsome man
like me to do about it...

47:13.483 --> 47:16.733
except perform a lengthy soliloquy?

47:25.858 --> 47:27.525
Don't suppose you know how to play poker.

47:27.820 --> 47:29.820
I'm a fast learner.

47:37.042 --> 47:38.125
Would you like to deal?

47:38.680 --> 47:40.458
Sure.

47:40.608 --> 47:43.233
Please, lady pharaohs,

47:43.317 --> 47:46.400
I am very handsome,
but I am only one man.

47:47.775 --> 47:51.983
By the waters of the Nile,
this very handsome man shall be mine.

47:53.192 --> 47:56.400
By the shape of the pyramids,
I'll kill you if I can't have him.

47:56.483 --> 47:58.067
He's so handsome.

48:03.483 --> 48:06.442
Okay, if I win this hand,
you give me a backrub,

48:06.525 --> 48:08.483
but if you win again,
I'll put tape on my mouth.

48:37.692 --> 48:39.400
Please, Duchess.

48:39.483 --> 48:42.400
I am very handsome,
but I am only one man.

48:43.067 --> 48:46.983
By the turrets of Gravelstein,
this very handsome man shall be mine.

48:47.067 --> 48:48.483
By the Gardens of Worthington,

48:48.567 --> 48:50.983
if I can't have him,
my heart will literally break.

48:51.067 --> 48:54.358
Figuratively.
"My heart will figuratively break."

48:54.442 --> 48:57.275
Why, what handsome adventures I have had,

48:57.358 --> 49:00.442
only to end up at this same pond
on this...

49:01.108 --> 49:02.525
my wedding day!

49:44.067 --> 49:45.525
Say your line.

49:53.608 --> 49:55.400
Do you...

49:55.483 --> 50:00.817
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

50:08.858 --> 50:10.483
I do.

50:14.108 --> 50:17.567
- Do you take this woman...
- Man.

50:17.650 --> 50:20.983
Man. Do you take this man...

50:21.067 --> 50:24.525
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

50:48.192 --> 50:50.483
I do.

50:50.567 --> 50:55.233
By the powers vested in me
by going to law school,

50:55.317 --> 50:59.275
I now pronounce you Count and Countess.

50:59.358 --> 51:00.483
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

51:07.567 --> 51:08.650
Okay.

51:19.775 --> 51:22.942
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make an announcement.

51:23.025 --> 51:26.567
There is no need to continue
with tonight's performance.

51:32.025 --> 51:35.983
For its purpose has been served.

51:36.067 --> 51:38.983
This has not been a scene of fiction.

51:39.067 --> 51:42.317
My marriage to Violet Baudelaire
is perfectly legal,

51:42.400 --> 51:45.442
and I am now in control
of her entire fortune.

51:46.608 --> 51:48.442
That can't be true!

51:48.525 --> 51:50.567
On the contrary, Judgikins,

51:50.650 --> 51:54.358
the law of the land clearly states
that the bride must say "I do"

51:54.442 --> 51:57.817
and sign the appropriate document
in her own hand.

51:57.900 --> 52:01.483
And all of you,
ladies and gentlemen, are witnesses.

52:01.567 --> 52:04.192
Violet is only a child.
She's not old enough to marry.

52:04.275 --> 52:06.233
She is if her legal guardian allows it.

52:06.317 --> 52:09.442
And in addition to being her husband,
I am also her legal guardian.

52:09.525 --> 52:12.358
But that piece of paper's
not an official document.

52:12.442 --> 52:14.483
It's... it's just a stage prop.

52:14.567 --> 52:16.067
If you look closely enough,

52:16.150 --> 52:18.817
I think you'll see that
it is figuratively real.

52:18.900 --> 52:20.900
- Literally.
- I said literally.

52:22.317 --> 52:24.983
I'm afraid this marriage
is entirely binding.

52:25.067 --> 52:26.358
Violet...

52:26.442 --> 52:30.400
you said "I do" and signed this paper
in your own hand.

52:31.358 --> 52:34.025
Count Olaf,
you are now Violet's legal husband.

52:34.692 --> 52:35.733
And?

52:35.817 --> 52:39.567
And a vile and terrible person.

52:39.650 --> 52:41.442
A vile and terrible person

52:41.525 --> 52:46.233
who is in complete control
of the Baudelaires' entire fortune.

52:46.317 --> 52:48.525
This is absolutely horrendous.
I won't allow it!

52:48.608 --> 52:50.317
I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.650
Count Olaf is correct.

52:53.775 --> 52:55.900
This marriage is legally binding.

52:55.983 --> 53:00.108
I am so sorry, Baudelaires.

53:00.192 --> 53:02.733
I can't believe how easily I was tricked.

53:02.817 --> 53:04.650
You were easily tricked!

53:04.733 --> 53:07.525
It was child's play, winning this fortune.

53:07.608 --> 53:11.858
And now, a reception to celebrate
my special day. Hit it!

53:14.275 --> 53:16.442
Oh, thank you.

53:19.650 --> 53:21.067
Stop.

53:21.150 --> 53:22.233
First, let Sunny go.

53:22.317 --> 53:23.483
Where is Sunny?

53:23.567 --> 53:26.358
I'm afraid she's tied up at the moment,

53:26.442 --> 53:28.692
if you'll forgive my little joke.

53:31.442 --> 53:34.442
See, it's a little play on words.
"All tied up" is a figurative...

53:34.525 --> 53:36.108
You promised to let her go!

53:36.192 --> 53:40.317
Oh, and what kind of husband would I be
if I didn't keep my promises?

53:41.983 --> 53:44.233
Drop the pip-squeak to her death.

53:44.317 --> 53:45.358
No.

53:50.608 --> 53:53.150
You idiot! What are you doing?

53:53.233 --> 53:55.400
Well, I had to bring her here.
She had a straight flush.

53:56.650 --> 53:59.858
So, you escaped, you little dishrag.

53:59.942 --> 54:03.567
Well, I'm still married to Violet,
and I will dispense with you

54:03.650 --> 54:05.317
on our honeymoon.

54:05.983 --> 54:08.983
Care to dance, Countess?

54:11.275 --> 54:14.025
I'm not a Countess.
At least I don't think I am.

54:14.108 --> 54:16.775
- Wait.
- And why not, pray tell?

54:16.858 --> 54:19.358
I didn't sign the document in my own hand,
as the law states.

54:19.442 --> 54:22.150
Don't lie to me, orphan.
Everyone saw you.

54:22.233 --> 54:26.858
Yes, there were several hundred witnesses,
not to mention those on the mezzanine.

54:26.942 --> 54:28.275
But I'm right-handed,

54:28.358 --> 54:30.275
and I signed the document
with my left hand.

54:31.067 --> 54:32.900
Well, that doesn't count.

54:32.983 --> 54:37.608
You're just being a sore loser and trying
to ruin my special day.

54:40.108 --> 54:41.358
With all due respect,

54:41.442 --> 54:43.858
I think Justice Strauss
ought to tell us if it counts.

54:43.942 --> 54:45.275
That's right.

54:45.358 --> 54:48.817
That's right. I should tell you.
I am a judge.

54:49.942 --> 54:51.192
Let me think.

55:01.442 --> 55:02.442
I don't know.

55:02.525 --> 55:04.025
What?

55:04.108 --> 55:08.608
You should never be afraid to admit
that you don't know something.

55:08.692 --> 55:10.900
This is a very complicated case.

55:10.983 --> 55:14.900
It would take
a formidable legal scholar to solve it.

55:14.983 --> 55:16.817
May I have a blackboard, please?

55:19.733 --> 55:22.317
In the respected legal tome,
<i>Nuptial Law,</i>

55:22.400 --> 55:25.692
John Locke's
1690s groundbreaking work is cited,

55:25.775 --> 55:28.608
postulating that the law of the land
rests on the...

55:28.692 --> 55:30.983
As you can well imagine,
Klaus' legal argument

55:31.067 --> 55:33.608
had all the apocryphal insight
of Thurgood Marshall

55:33.692 --> 55:36.567
and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells,
a phrase which here means

55:36.650 --> 55:40.442
it was thoroughly impressive
and utterly convincing.

55:40.525 --> 55:43.233
And so, as Martin Luther King said,

55:43.317 --> 55:47.442
"Morality cannot be legislated,
but behavior can be regulated.

55:47.525 --> 55:50.317
Judicial decrees
may not change the heart...

55:50.400 --> 55:52.483
but they can restrain the heartless."

55:52.567 --> 55:55.567
Ah! That moral argument

55:55.650 --> 55:59.317
had all the apocryphal insight
of Thurgood Marshall

55:59.400 --> 56:02.525
and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.

56:02.608 --> 56:07.858
It was thoroughly impressive
and utterly convincing.

56:07.942 --> 56:11.775
And I am happy to say
that because Violet,

56:11.858 --> 56:16.525
who is right-handed,
signed the document with her left hand,

56:16.608 --> 56:18.858
the marriage is invalid.

56:26.067 --> 56:30.817
Well, you may not be my wife,
but you are still my daughter.

56:30.900 --> 56:32.692
Do you honestly believe I will allow you

56:32.775 --> 56:34.483
to continue to care
for these three children

56:34.567 --> 56:36.358
after the treachery
I've seen here tonight?

56:36.442 --> 56:38.025
I'm even considering firing your associate

56:38.108 --> 56:39.817
- as my secretary.
- Hear, hear!

56:40.608 --> 56:41.858
Jacquelyn, is that you?

56:41.942 --> 56:43.400
- Where have you been?
- I was kidnapped

56:43.483 --> 56:45.317
by Count Olaf's associates
and tied to a tree

56:45.400 --> 56:47.942
before I could tell you that
the Baudelaires' uncle, Dr. Montgomery,

56:48.025 --> 56:50.275
was designated by the parents
as their legal guardian

56:50.358 --> 56:51.733
and has been waiting to hear from you.

56:51.817 --> 56:54.900
- Dr. Montgomery?
- I've never heard of him.

56:55.483 --> 56:57.608
Well, you are hereby refired
as my secretary

56:57.692 --> 56:59.358
with an 8% increase in salary.

56:59.442 --> 57:01.900
The Baudelaires will be sent
to a suitable guardian

57:01.983 --> 57:04.942
and this series of unfortunate events
has come to a close.

57:06.608 --> 57:08.650
As for you, Count Olaf...

57:11.025 --> 57:15.483
I'll get my hands on your fortune
if it's the last thing I do.

57:15.567 --> 57:17.025
And when I have it,

57:17.108 --> 57:23.358
I will tear you and your siblings
from limb to limb.

57:23.442 --> 57:25.983
Not funny, guys.

57:27.567 --> 57:29.525
Olaf? Olaf?

57:30.358 --> 57:31.442
Olaf!

57:32.275 --> 57:33.400
He's escaped!

57:33.483 --> 57:37.108
Wait until the readers
of the <i>Daily Punctilio</i> hear about this!

57:37.192 --> 57:39.150
You have to capture him!
You have to go after him!

57:39.233 --> 57:41.400
You let the authorities worry about that.

57:41.483 --> 57:43.650
You children, come home with me.

57:43.733 --> 57:45.442
Sorry, but the children must come with me.

57:45.525 --> 57:48.858
I cannot allow the Baudelaires to be
raised by someone who is not a relative.

57:48.942 --> 57:50.608
What?
After all Justice Strauss has done for us?

57:50.692 --> 57:52.358
We never would've figured out
Count Olaf's plan

57:52.442 --> 57:53.733
without Justice Strauss and her library.

57:53.817 --> 57:56.983
That may be so,
but your parents' will is very specific.

57:57.067 --> 57:58.733
He's right.

57:58.817 --> 58:01.317
There's a vigorously fixed destination
your parents had in mind for you,

58:01.400 --> 58:04.817
and it is not with Count Olaf
or Justice Strauss.

58:10.358 --> 58:11.608
Well...

58:13.858 --> 58:15.108
goodbye, children.

58:16.233 --> 58:18.483
I'll miss you very much.

58:18.567 --> 58:20.108
We'll miss you, too.

58:20.880 --> 58:22.880
Your dreams of being an actress put us
in grave danger.

58:23.480 --> 58:24.958
But your heat was in the right place.

58:25.108 --> 58:26.275
Come along, Baudelaires.

58:33.358 --> 58:34.942
Goodbye.

58:36.108 --> 58:37.150
Bye!

58:48.358 --> 58:52.150
- Where are we gonna go now, boss?
- To a vigorously fixed destination.

59:01.233 --> 59:03.608
Some things in life are difficult
to understand,

59:03.692 --> 59:05.983
even after years and years
of thinking about 'em

59:06.067 --> 59:09.275
while wandering alone
through desolate landscapes...

59:09.942 --> 59:11.317
usually during the off-season.

59:20.192 --> 59:23.400
Gustav, have the Baudelaires arrived
at Dr. Montgomery's?

59:23.483 --> 59:26.483
Repeat. Have the Baudelaires arrived
at Dr. Montgomery's?

59:26.567 --> 59:27.608
Not yet.

59:27.692 --> 59:30.567
But I'm literally standing
at the edge of a pond. Ow!

59:33.733 --> 59:36.775
I have a lead on our missing parents.
They're alive, but they've been...

59:36.858 --> 59:39.025
The world is quiet here.

59:47.483 --> 59:48.733
Gustav?

59:50.733 --> 59:51.942
Gustav?

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.200
 Adoption 
law & you

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.775
<i>The Baudelaires
did not understand</i>

01:00:26.858 --> 01:00:29.067
<i>why they were now off toward
an unknown relative</i>

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:31.317
<i>instead of living with Justice Strauss.</i>

01:00:34.858 --> 01:00:37.692
<i>But as with so many
unfortunate events in life,</i>

01:00:37.775 --> 01:00:41.108
<i>just because you don't understand it,
doesn't mean it isn't so.</i>

01:00:51.567 --> 01:00:55.650
Usually, our theatrical reviews
are the most boring part of the paper.

01:00:55.733 --> 01:01:00.233
But I bet you little stage hogs
are about to make the front page again.

01:01:00.317 --> 01:01:02.942
The front page!

01:01:04.108 --> 01:01:07.275
<i>It seemed to the children
that they were moving in an aberrant,</i>

01:01:07.358 --> 01:01:11.983
<i>a word which here means "very, very wrong,
and causing much grief," direction.</i>

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640
<i>"Exciting night at theater,
orphans rescued!"</i>

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.317
Things are worse than we thought.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.858
They almost always are.

01:01:24.817 --> 01:01:27.900
Every moment the children are without us
drags them deeper into danger.

01:01:27.983 --> 01:01:29.483
Then we don't have a moment to lose.

01:01:30.317 --> 01:01:32.525
What's a woman like you building
in a place like this?

01:01:33.192 --> 01:01:34.358
Grappling hook.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.317
Molotov cocktail.

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.233
- You?
- Leave no stone unturned.
