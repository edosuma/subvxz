00:16.840 --> 00:18.455
THERE'S SO MUCH CHAOS.
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE.

ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
SORRY.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.239
- I AM A LITTLE BIT
OVERWHELMED.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.329
WHY WOULD YOUR DAD PLAN THIS
TRIP TO GO SEE YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

00:36.450 --> 00:38.406
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE HIS MOTHER.
- IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.828
HEY,
THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH, OKAY?

00:39.930 --> 00:41.272
EVERYBODY LOVES THEIR MOTHER.
I'M GONNA LOOK IN THE KITCHEN.

ARE YOU READY?

01:26.530 --> 01:29.385
HE FREAKS OUT ABOUT GRANDMA.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.424

01:54.700 --> 01:55.689
- DON'T YELL AT ME.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.791

02:16.200 --> 02:17.406
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.398
- LIKE LAST SATURDAY, WHEN YOU
SAID I WOULDN'T BE ABLE

02:19.510 --> 02:20.442
TO GO TO THE MOVIES,
AND THEN YOU TOTALLY FORGOT...

02:20.550 --> 02:21.517
- THAT IS--

OR HER 84TH BIRTHDAY,

03:12.010 --> 03:14.353
OR HER 77TH BIRTHDAY,

AND NORA'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING

03:40.530 --> 03:41.519
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU CAN
NURSE, WHICH I DON'T SEE--

03:41.630 --> 03:45.009

I THINK THIS IS EXTREME.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.497
- YOUR SON CALLED ME
A BITCH.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.352
HE CALLED ME A BITCH TW--
TWICE.

03:49.470 --> 03:50.562
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
AND I'M SORRY, OKAY?

03:50.670 --> 03:51.466
- IT'S NOT COOL.

03:51.570 --> 03:52.537

HE DIDN'T MEAN IT,

03:52.640 --> 03:54.084
AND I WANNA COME UP
WITH A SOLUTION HERE.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.703
- I DON'T CARE
IF HE MEANT IT OR NOT--

03:55.820 --> 03:57.538
- WELL, WHY, OF ALL PUNISHMENTS,
DID YOU CHOOSE THIS?

03:57.650 --> 03:59.368
- BECAUSE IT JUST CAME OUT
OF MY MOUTH, OKAY?

03:59.480 --> 04:00.299
I NEED TO FOLLOW
THROUGH ON THIS.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.229

CREATIVELY?

04:01.340 --> 04:02.193
COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT
PUNISHMENT?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.163
- CREATIVELY WHAT?

04:03.270 --> 04:04.237
- MAYBE JUST ISSUE HIM
A WARNING?

04:04.340 --> 04:05.261
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
TO MY DAD.

04:05.380 --> 04:06.062
- HIS HAPPINESS
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME

04:06.170 --> 04:08.092
FOLLOWING THROUGH
ON A PUNISHMENT?

04:08.210 --> 04:09.279
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.587
I NEED TO STICK TO MY GUNS
ON THIS, OKAY?

04:11.690 --> 04:14.079

05:23.590 --> 05:24.591
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

ONCE WE GET TO HIS MOM'S.

15:14.390 --> 15:18.178
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST NOW HE'S GOT
THE--YOU KNOW, THE ANXIETY.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.518
- IS HE WORRIED ABOUT HER
'CAUSE SHE FELL?

15:19.640 --> 15:22.768
- NO, IT'S THE--IT'S
HIS WHOLE THING WITH HIS MOM.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.223
WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND
OF PARENTS THAT YOU KIDS HAVE.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.082
- SMOKING HOT?
- WHAT KIND IS THAT?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.337
- SMOKING HOT PARENTS?
- [laughs]

15:28.440 --> 15:30.328
- NO, SUPPORTIVE.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.499
WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN,
HE HAD A LOT OF DREAMS.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.235
THERE WERE THINGS HE WANTED
TO DO AND BE AND--

15:34.340 --> 15:37.093
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE BEING AN ACTOR.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.689
- AWW.
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID

15:38.790 --> 15:41.179
TO HIM WHEN HE TOLD HER
HE WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR?

15:41.280 --> 15:42.656
- WHAT?

15:42.760 --> 15:45.172
- SHE SAID, "AND WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK YOU'RE SO SPECIAL?"

15:45.280 --> 15:47.077
AND HE WAS SPECIAL.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.283
BUT HE STILL HEARS HER VOICE
IN HIS HEAD, EVEN NOW.

15:52.390 --> 15:54.847
YOU KNOW, AND THE--I THINK,
IN SOME WAYS,

15:54.950 --> 15:57.464
HE STILL IS, UM,
SEEKING HER APPROVAL.

15:57.570 --> 16:01.529
- UH, WHOSE APPROVAL?
- THE W-WAITRESS'.

16:01.650 --> 16:04.164
- THE EXTRA SLAW.
- TALKING ABOUT MY MOM, HUH?

16:04.270 --> 16:05.817
- DAD, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW

16:05.930 --> 16:07.124
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY
SO MUCH

16:07.240 --> 16:08.639
ABOUT WHAT GRANDMA THINKS,
THAT'S ALL.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.068
- YEAH, WE DON'T WORRY
ABOUT WHAT YOU TWO THINK,

16:10.170 --> 16:11.273
AND LOOK AT US.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.347
WE'RE ALL, UH,
SMASHING SUCCESSES.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.179
- YEAH, CLEARLY.
- [chuckles]

16:14.280 --> 16:16.316
- BESIDES, GRANDMA'S, UH--
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT BONKERS.

16:16.420 --> 16:19.275
YOU SHOULDN'T LET HER OPINION
INFORM YOU ABOUT ANYTHING.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.971
- "BONKERS"?
I MEAN, SHE'S YOUR GRANDMA.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.149
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE RESPECT HERE,
CROSBY?

16:22.250 --> 16:23.285
- I THOUGHT I WAS BEING NICE
ABOUT IT.

16:23.390 --> 16:25.005
- JUST A LITTLE BIT.
JUST TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.803
- IT'S CUTE.
IT'S LIKE A SITCOM.

16:26.910 --> 16:28.252
- IT ISN'T EVEN CHRIS--

16:28.360 --> 16:30.225
- IT'S BONKERS GRANDMA.
- GUYS--

16:30.330 --> 16:31.399
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU--

16:31.500 --> 16:34.253
- WHERE THE HELL
IS THE CHAIR?

16:34.370 --> 16:35.814
- OH, MY GOD.
- [gasp5]

16:35.920 --> 16:37.262
- I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE
WOULD STEAL THAT.

16:37.370 --> 16:38.814
- AW, COME ON,
IS THIS A JOKE?

16:38.920 --> 16:40.160
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:40.270 --> 16:43.023
WELL, WHERE THE HELL
IS THE CHAIR?

16:43.140 --> 16:44.858
I TOLD YOU TO KEEP YOUR EYES
ON IT, AND IT'S GONE!

16:44.960 --> 16:48.236
- I LOOKED AT MY MENU
AND IT WAS GONE!

16:48.350 --> 16:51.558
THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN FAR.
IT'S A 600-POUND RECLINER.

16:51.660 --> 16:52.797
- THIS IS NOT FUNNY!

16:52.900 --> 16:56.210
[overlapping chatter
and laughter]

17:01.220 --> 17:02.084
- BOY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S MAKING ME

17:02.190 --> 17:03.327
DRIVE THE REST
OF THE WAY.

17:03.430 --> 17:06.149
IT JUST DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR SOMEHOW.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.249
[sighs]
- AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T

17:07.370 --> 17:11.261
HAVE TO SEE HER HAVING SEX
WITH MR. CYR.

17:11.370 --> 17:12.439
YEAH.
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.643
- ABSOLUTELY, YES.
I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.365
- OH, MY GOD.
NO.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.617
- I, LIKE, WENT TO GET A CD
FROM THE GUESTHOUSE

17:16.720 --> 17:19.848
AND WALKED IN ON--YEAH.
- [gasps] NO.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.029
EW. [gasps]
- AND I CAN'T EVEN

17:21.140 --> 17:22.300
HARDLY MAKE
EYE CONTACT.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.796
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.822
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MAD
AND ANGRY THIS WHOLE TRIP.

17:25.940 --> 17:27.168
- AND SHE IS COMING, SO--
- OKAY.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.862
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
PLEASE, NO.

17:29.970 --> 17:31.938
- OH, MY GOD,
GRANDPA IS LOSING IT.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.278
- [chuckles]
- HEY, CAN I MOVE THIS?

17:33.390 --> 17:35.950
- YOU BET, YEAH.
OH, WOW, OKAY.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.666
- [sighs] THANK YOU.
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.533
[sighs]
LET'S GO.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.868

17:42.990 --> 17:45.845
[country music]

17:48.610 --> 17:52.444

RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW, HUH?

17:52.550 --> 17:54.063
WHAT AM I GONNA GET
MY MOM?

17:54.170 --> 17:57.207
HAPPY 86TH BIRTH DAY,

17:57.310 --> 18:01.132
HERE'S, UH,

18:01.250 --> 18:04.651
HOW ABOUT A BASEBALL CAP OR A--

18:04.770 --> 18:06.624
HOW ABOUT THAT?
[scoffs]

18:06.740 --> 18:08.492
- OR ONE OF THOSE GREAT
LITTLE CIGARETTE LIGHTERS

18:08.600 --> 18:10.659

18:15.160 --> 18:17.299

AH, UH, NO.

18:27.070 --> 18:28.992
THEY SAY HI BACK.

MY ROOM.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.966
- IT LOOKS AMAZING.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.002
YOU DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.670
- CAN WE GO
ON THE TRIP NOW?

19:16.770 --> 19:19.523
- NO, BUDDY.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.258
I'M--I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.640
- DAD, LET ME GET $10.

19:35.760 --> 19:36.954
- FOR WHAT?

19:37.070 --> 19:38.617
- UH, FOR THIS '705 CD
OVER THERE.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.518
IT LOOKS FUNNY AND WEIRD.
WE CAN LISTEN TO IT IN THE CAR.

19:41.620 --> 19:42.826
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MONEY,

19:42.940 --> 19:46.933
SO YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE
BESIDES TALK TO ME ON THIS TRIP.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.723
- UH, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

19:48.840 --> 19:50.728
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU,

19:50.840 --> 19:53.456
IT'S NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

19:53.570 --> 19:55.322
- [scoffs]
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW,

19:55.430 --> 19:57.660
BUT IT SOUNDS KIND OF CHILDISH.
I DON'T KNOW--

19:57.780 --> 19:59.498
- WELL, IT QUITE POSSIBLY
IS CHILDISH, HADDIE.

19:59.610 --> 20:01.362
I'M SURE IT'S NOT NEARLY
AS ADULT OR AS ENGROSSING

20:01.470 --> 20:03.335
AS TEXTING YOUR FRIEND CAROLINE
FOR HOURS

20:03.440 --> 20:05.954
OR LISTENING TO TAYLOR SWIFT
FOR THE 1,400TH TIME.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.164
- OKAY, WHOA. I--ARE YOU--
IS THIS A SERIOUS FIGHT?

20:08.270 --> 20:09.191
- YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.334
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE

20:14.480 --> 20:16.550
- NOT ABOUT ANYTHING IMPORTANT
OR REAL, YOU KNOW?

20:16.660 --> 20:18.309
- YOU WANT TO BE HAVING SERIOUS,
HEAW CONVERSATIONS?

20:18.420 --> 20:19.341
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HAVE FUN.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.519
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO HAVE FUN TOO.

20:20.630 --> 20:21.585
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN
TO TALK TO MY DAUGHTER

20:21.700 --> 20:23.008
SIX MONTHS BEFORE SHE GOES AWAY
TO COLLEGE,

20:23.110 --> 20:24.008
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.862

20:25.980 --> 20:26.935

20:27.050 --> 20:31.419
- THANKS FOR THE GUILT TRIP.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.496
- I LIKE THIS ONE, BUT I LIKE
THE OTHER ONE BETTER.

20:33.610 --> 20:34.872
- ALL RIGHT,
THE OTHER ONE IT IS.

20:34.990 --> 20:36.082
- ALL RIGHT.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.160
- I THINK
SHE'LL LIKE IT.

20:41.270 --> 20:42.578
- HEY.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.447
DO YOU THINK MY MOM
WOULD LIKE THIS?

20:47.550 --> 20:52.169
- I THINK IT WOULD LOOK
REALLY PRETTY ON HER.

20:52.280 --> 20:57.343
- YEAH, OKAY.

21:01.430 --> 21:02.567
- LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT IS THIS FOR, MY HAIR?

21:02.670 --> 21:04.080
- NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.327
- EW, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S A--

21:05.430 --> 21:06.738
LOOK, I GOT US
MATCHING HATS.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.841
- OH, CUTE.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.157
- DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
CHEERED HIM UP VERY MUCH.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.123
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

21:12.230 --> 21:14.403
- WELL, YOU KNOW.

21:14.510 --> 21:16.501
I DON'T KNOW.
[chuckles]

IN THE GUESTHOUSE.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.006
- WHAT?

21:34.120 --> 21:37.248
- AN INTIMATE UNION
OF BODIES.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.975
- [chuckles]
SHUT UP.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.297
[gasps] OH, NO!

IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT'S THE WORST THING EVER.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.360
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, OKAY?

21:47.470 --> 21:49.119
- IT'S SO TERRIBLE FOR--
EVEN FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT--

21:49.230 --> 21:50.333
- EVEN FOR ME, PLEASE.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.611
- AND I'M, LIKE, ENLIGHTENED,
AND IT'S HORRIBLE.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.199
IT'S--HE'S REALLY UPSET.
- WHAT DO I DO?

21:53.310 --> 21:54.823
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO--

21:54.930 --> 21:57.444
HOW TO FIX THIS.
THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.539
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

21:58.660 --> 21:59.581
- [sighs]

22:10.290 --> 22:14.420

22:34.240 --> 22:36.037

22:36.140 --> 22:37.869
I DON'T THINK I'M FEELING
VERY GOOD, I MEAN--

22:37.970 --> 22:40.416
- WHY DON'T YOU GO LIE DOWN?
- I DON'T WANT TO LIE DOWN.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.213
I MEAN, I STILL GOTTA CALL
MY MOTHER AND TELL HER

22:42.320 --> 22:43.969
THAT HALF THE FAMILY
ISN'T COMING.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.945
- WHY ARE YOU HARPING ON THIS?
- OH, MY GOD.

22:46.050 --> 22:47.529
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN'T LET IT GO.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.039
[overlapping chatter]

22:49.160 --> 22:51.082
YOU CAN'T LET IT GO.
- NO, NO, I GOTTA SAY SOMETHING.

22:51.190 --> 22:51.872
ADAM, THIS IS FROM THE HEART.

22:51.990 --> 22:54.390
I MEAN,
I ASK SO LITTLE OF YOU, SON.

22:54.510 --> 22:56.535
- DAD!

22:56.650 --> 22:59.505
- REALLY? ARE YOU JOKING?
- OKAY.

22:59.610 --> 23:01.089
LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.237
- DAD, YOU GOT US PILED IN
THESE CARS LIKE SHARECROPPERS,

23:04.340 --> 23:05.546
TRAIPSING
ALL AROUND THE STATE,

23:05.660 --> 23:07.378
AND WE'RE DOING THAT FOR YOU,
AND YOU'RE MAD.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.378
THIS IS INSANE.
- OH, YEAH, WELL, THE ONLY THING

23:08.490 --> 23:09.445
I ASKED YOU TO DO
WAS JUST GO UP

23:09.560 --> 23:10.868
AND VISIT MY MOTHER
ON HER 86TH BIRTHDAY.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.312
- WHAT THE HELL
YOU THINK WE'RE DOING HERE?

23:12.420 --> 23:14.035
- THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU THINK
IT'S A WAR CRIME

23:14.150 --> 23:15.526
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- DAD, IT'S NOT A WAR CRIME.

23:15.630 --> 23:16.904
IT'S JUST THAT W--
- YEAH.

23:17.010 --> 23:19.240

BLUE, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF NOTICE.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.315
AND SO WE ALL
WORKED REALLY HARD

23:20.430 --> 23:22.284
TO GET OUR SCHEDULES ARRANGED

23:22.400 --> 23:23.389
- SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS

23:23.500 --> 23:25.422
ARE DOING ME THIS GIANT FAVOR.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.802
- NO, SWEETIE,
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.127
- THAT'S--
- NO, THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID.

23:29.230 --> 23:31.460
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, REALLY.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.196
YOU GUYS--

23:46.320 --> 23:49.209
[chair slides]

23:49.320 --> 23:52.209
- MOM.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.987
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO TURN THIS SO MUCH.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.229
JUST HOLD IT STRAIGHT
AND THEN WAIT WHEN YOU--

24:02.330 --> 24:03.570

A WHILE AGO.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.602
MAYBE, LIKE,
BEFORE 8:00.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.369
[bell rings]
- TRUCK'S NOT THERE.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.401
- HE CHECKED OUT.
- THANKS, JOEL.

24:08.510 --> 24:10.649
UH, DID--DID HE SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.682
- I DON'T USUALLY
ASK PEOPLE

24:11.790 --> 24:13.951
WHERE THEY'RE GOING
WHEN THEY CHECK OUT.

24:14.070 --> 24:15.059
- OKAY.

24:15.170 --> 24:16.797
- NEITHER OF THEM ARE ANSWERING
THEIR CELL PHONES.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.959
- HOW DO I DO THIS?
- YOU GOT IT.

24:19.070 --> 24:22.528
[cell phone ringing]
- NO, DON'T ANSWER THAT.

24:22.630 --> 24:23.858
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY. REALLY.

24:23.970 --> 24:25.528
- OH, COME ON.
- NO, I DON'T WANT THEM

24:25.630 --> 24:27.803
COMING ALONG
ON THIS TRIP ANYMORE.

24:27.910 --> 24:29.218
HECK WITH IT.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.777
I DON'T WANT THEM THINKING
THAT I MADE THEM DO IT.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.223
AND THEN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT, CAMILLE.

24:34.330 --> 24:38.084
MY GOD, LET THEM LEARN A LESSON,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.547
- IT REALLY--
IT'S SO TYPICAL OF DAD.

24:46.650 --> 24:47.639
SELFISH.
- IT'S SO MANIPULATIVE.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.579
- I DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD
I SUCK.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.305
I KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

24:50.410 --> 24:51.547
- AND NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO FEEL GUILTY.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.628
- YEAH.
- BUT I DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

24:53.730 --> 24:54.719
- NO,
I DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

24:54.830 --> 24:55.762
- I DON'T.
I JUST FEEL ANNOYED.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.588
- YEAH.
- I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THE CHAIR.

24:57.700 --> 24:58.621
I REALLY BLEW IT ON THAT ONE.
- WELL, THAT--

24:58.730 --> 24:59.867
YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD.

24:59.980 --> 25:02.244
- HE DID ASK ME TO WATCH IT.
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

25:02.360 --> 25:03.566
- WELL, LET'S JUST DO WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO, AND LET'S--

25:03.670 --> 25:04.352
LET'S PUT OUR TAILS
BETWEEN OUR LEGS

25:04.460 --> 25:05.734
AND GET UP THERE
AND APOLOGIZE.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.659
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE WANTS US TO DO.

25:06.780 --> 25:07.599
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

25:07.710 --> 25:09.041
WHAT DO WE HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE FOR?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.491
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD.
- I KNOW, BUT--

25:10.610 --> 25:12.225
- OKAY, YOU KNOW,
I LEFT HALF MY FAMILY BEHIND,

25:12.330 --> 25:14.537
SO I COULD DO THIS FOR HIM.
WHERE'S THE APPRECIATION?

25:14.650 --> 25:15.605
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
APPRECIATION.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.369
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET
APPRECIATION.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.506
- AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T GO
ALONG AND GIVE INTO THIS STUNT.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.541
I-IT'S LIKE SAYING,
"YOU WIN."

25:21.650 --> 25:23.026
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT GRANDMA?

25:23.140 --> 25:24.402
- PERSONALLY,
SHE DOESN'T APPROVE OF ME.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.239
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE SHE SAID TO
DAD, "I DON'T APPROVE OF SARAH,"

25:27.350 --> 25:28.658
AND THEN HE TOLD ME,
SO--

25:28.760 --> 25:32.070
- I SAY
WE DON'T FOLLOW THEM.

25:34.740 --> 25:36.116
- LET'S GO HOME.
- THAT FEELS GOOD.

25:36.220 --> 25:37.664
I LIKE IT.
- LET'S STOP AT THAT SPLIT PEA--

25:37.770 --> 25:39.078
- WOW, REALLY?
- COME ON, BUDDY.

25:39.190 --> 25:41.078
WE'RE GOING HOME.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.786
- HI, BUD.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.036
YOU HUNGRY?

26:00.140 --> 26:03.200
- NO.

26:03.320 --> 26:09.099
- DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
UNPACK YOUR BAG?

26:09.220 --> 26:13.498
- [sighs]

26:13.600 --> 26:15.044
- CAREFUL.
- [grunts]

26:15.150 --> 26:20.156
- CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

26:22.060 --> 26:24.437
- SO BUDDY, WHAT KIND
OF A LESSON DID WE LEARN

26:24.540 --> 26:25.575
FROM ALL OF THIS?

26:25.680 --> 26:28.262
- I CAN'T CALL YOU NAMES.
- RIGHT.

26:28.370 --> 26:29.576
EVER.
- EVER.

26:29.690 --> 26:32.784
- ESPECIALLY THAT NAME.
IT'S NOT A NICE NAME.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.891
WHAT IS THIS, BUDDY?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.969
- IT WAS
FOR MAMA BLANCHE.

26:38.070 --> 26:40.459
LAST TIME I SAW HER, SHE SAID
SHE LIKED BUGS AND THINGS

26:40.560 --> 26:44.451
LIKE THAT, SO--

26:44.560 --> 26:48.599
[rattling]

26:51.610 --> 26:53.771
HOW DO YOU
FOLD A SHIRT?

27:04.310 --> 27:07.165
[rock music]

27:07.280 --> 27:08.167
- IF YOU'D IMAGINE

27:08.280 --> 27:10.419
THE MUSIC SO REAL

27:10.520 --> 27:12.624
[song volume decreases]

27:12.730 --> 27:17.144
- I'M SORRY THAT I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU.

27:17.250 --> 27:19.218
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WAS TIRED.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.834
I OVERREACT ED.
IT'S OKAY.

27:21.950 --> 27:25.738
- I JUST ALSO
WAS THINKING THAT--

27:25.850 --> 27:29.490
I'M JUST SO USED TO BEING ABLE
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU...

27:29.610 --> 27:31.885
WHEN EVER.

27:31.990 --> 27:34.504
I DON'T THINK
ABOUT NOT SEEING YOU,

27:34.610 --> 27:38.649
LIKE WHEN I'M GOING TO SCHOOL--
HOW THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

27:38.760 --> 27:42.344
'CAUSE IT'S SCARY TO THINK
THAT I'M GONNA BE, LIKE,

27:42.450 --> 27:45.578
AN ADULT, AND YOU HAVE
TO TAKE THINGS SERIOUSLY.

27:45.690 --> 27:47.829
AND IT'S SCARY, RIGHT?

27:47.940 --> 27:50.556
YOU'RE JUST MY DAD.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.458
I'M SO USED
TO HAVING YOU AROUND.

27:53.560 --> 27:58.805
SO I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I AM HAVING FUN WITH YOU.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.709
- WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I THINK YOU ARE

28:07.820 --> 28:11.301
AN AMAZING YOUNG WOMAN.

28:11.410 --> 28:14.755
I DO.
IT'S TRUE.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.273
- THIS IS HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, RIGHT?

28:25.660 --> 28:27.480
[blinker clicks]

28:29.220 --> 28:32.735
- OH, GOD.
- WHAT IS HAPPENING?

28:32.840 --> 28:34.592
- I'M FEELING GUILTY.

28:34.710 --> 28:35.870
- OH, GOD.
- YES.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.049
- OKAY, YOU?
- YEAH, I FEEL PRETTY LOUSY.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.845
I MEAN, BIG, BIG, GUILT, SO--
- IS IT WRONG THAT I DON'T FEEL

28:40.960 --> 28:43.099
ANYTHING AT ALL?
- YES, THAT IS WRONG.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.474
- LET'S GO.
- YOU MIGHT NOT BE HUMAN.

28:44.580 --> 28:46.161
- LET'S GET
A SPEEDING TICKET AGAIN.

28:46.270 --> 28:48.067
[engines start]

29:02.320 --> 29:05.528
[knocking at door]

29:09.260 --> 29:11.876
- WHY ISN'T SHE
ANSWERING THE DOOR?

29:11.990 --> 29:13.844
- MAYBE SHE CAN'T HEAR IT.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.508
- WELL, SHE CAN HEAR.

29:15.610 --> 29:16.770
I MEAN,
HER EARS ARE JUST FINE.

29:16.890 --> 29:19.404
IT'S HER HIPS, YOU KNOW,
COULD BE SOLD FOR PARTS,

29:19.510 --> 29:22.195
BUT SHE CAN HEAR GOOD.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.129
MOM!

29:23.240 --> 29:25.162
YOU THINK
SOMETHING HAPPENED?

29:25.280 --> 29:28.101
- MAYBE THERE'S
A WINDOW OPEN.

29:28.210 --> 29:29.131
- MOM!

29:29.250 --> 29:31.275
ARE YOU OKAY?

29:31.390 --> 29:32.721
MOM!
- HEY.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.525
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT.
MOM!

29:35.630 --> 29:38.076
I'M COMING IN.

29:38.190 --> 29:41.398
[grunts]

29:41.500 --> 29:44.151
- MOM?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.841
- MO
HEY'!“

29:45.950 --> 29:47.941
- MOM?
- MOM!

29:48.060 --> 29:50.267
HEY!

29:50.370 --> 29:54.852
HELLO?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.576
SHE'S NOT HERE.

29:57.690 --> 29:58.918
- NO, TODAY'S TUESDAY.

29:59.030 --> 30:03.273
RIGHT?
"BRIDGE CLUB, 1:30."

30:03.380 --> 30:04.301
- WHAT?

30:04.420 --> 30:06.103
- SHE HAS BRIDGE CLUB.

30:06.210 --> 30:08.770
- SHE SCHEDULED A BRIDGE GAME
THE DAY WE ARRIVE?

30:08.870 --> 30:10.178
- WELL, I M--
- AND WE--

30:10.290 --> 30:12.975
WE DRIVE HUNDREDS OF MILES,
WE GO THROUGH HELL TO GET HERE,

30:13.080 --> 30:15.389
AND SHE SCHEDULED A BRIDGE GAME?
I MEAN, THAT DAMN WOMAN.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.286
- I'M SURE IT'S--
IT'S EVERY TUESDAY AT 1:30.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.628
SHE'S OLD.

30:18.740 --> 30:21.493
- WELL, SO AM I, DAMN IT.
I MEAN, COME ON.

30:21.610 --> 30:23.532
IT'S JUST--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:23.640 --> 30:25.267
I'M THROUGH WITH THIS.
I'M DONE.

30:25.370 --> 30:27.918
FINISHED. I'M OUT OF HERE.
I AM SO FINISHED!

30:28.030 --> 30:30.919
KNOWS WE'RE COMING.
WHY THE HELL--

30:31.030 --> 30:34.136
- SURPRISE!
WE'RE HERE!

30:34.240 --> 30:35.514
- WHERE'S MAMA BLANCHE?
I HAVE A PRESENT FOR HER.

30:35.620 --> 30:38.441
- WHOA, MAX. WE FLEW DOWN
TO SURPRISE EVERYBODY,

30:38.560 --> 30:40.551
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE--
- YOU DESERVE A MEDAL,

30:40.660 --> 30:42.241
FLYING
WITH A THREE-MONTH-OLD.

30:42.350 --> 30:44.215
- THANK YOU.
I HAD A BEER ON THE PLANE,

30:44.320 --> 30:45.389
SO THAT HELPED
A LITTLE BIT.

30:45.490 --> 30:46.934
WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:47.050 --> 30:47.971
- OH, YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:48.080 --> 30:48.978
- YEAH.
- OH, I'LL TELL YOU

30:49.080 --> 30:50.490
WHAT HAPPENED.
- OKAY.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.521
- COME HERE.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.632
[grunts]
WELL, UM...

30:54.740 --> 30:58.050
KRISTINA,
THE DEAL IS...

30:58.160 --> 31:01.095
[sighs] I LOOK AT MY LIFE,
AND I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW,

31:01.200 --> 31:02.815
WHAT REALLY MATTERS,
AND, I MEAN,

31:02.930 --> 31:03.954
YOU GOT THE MEMORIES
AND ALL THAT.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.812
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

31:05.930 --> 31:09.058
BUT THE WHOLE PURPOSE
IS FAMILY.

31:09.170 --> 31:13.209
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY
WHAT I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT,

31:13.310 --> 31:15.483
AND I WANTED THE KIDS TO COME
WITH ME TO VISIT MY MOM.

31:15.590 --> 31:19.356
AND, UH, THEY WERE KIND OF
RELUCT ANT, SO I GOT ANGRY.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.111
I GOT MAD AT THEM AND JUST
COMPLETELY DROVE THEM AWAY.

31:22.220 --> 31:23.949
AND, UH,
PRETTY MUCH JUST SCREWED--

31:24.050 --> 31:26.109
I--I JUST PRETTY MUCH
SCREWED THE WHOLE THING UP.

31:26.220 --> 31:30.941
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

31:31.060 --> 31:34.678
- [sighs]
ZEEK, COME ON.

31:34.780 --> 31:35.883
ARE YOU KIDDING?

31:35.990 --> 31:37.878
YOU'RE KIDDING.
- MM.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.164
- YOU DIDN'T
SCREW ANYTHING UP.

31:41.270 --> 31:46.276
I MEAN,
I CAN SAY THIS, BECAUSE,

31:46.380 --> 31:48.109
WELL, YOU KNOW,

31:48.210 --> 31:52.419
COMING FROM A FAMILY
THAT'S REALLY LACKING, AND...

31:52.530 --> 31:55.283
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD

31:55.390 --> 31:59.394
OF YOURSELF
AND THIS FAMILY.

31:59.500 --> 32:04.187
YOU AND CAMILLE HAVE CREATED
THIS WONDERFUL AND WEIRD

32:04.300 --> 32:05.949
AND CRAZY...
[chuckles]

32:06.060 --> 32:09.951
GREAT FAMILY.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.743
AND I'M SO LUCKY
TO BE A PART OF IT.

32:11.860 --> 32:13.543
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

32:13.650 --> 32:16.778
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ALWAYS
TREATED ME LIKE A DAUGHTER.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.232
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR ME,

32:19.350 --> 32:22.649
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THAT.

32:22.760 --> 32:26.799
SO THANKS.

32:26.910 --> 32:28.036
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD--
- REALLY?

- HADDIE!
- HI!

33:52.090 --> 33:55.981
- SORRY FOR EVERYTHING,
POP.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.922
- YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
ADAM.

34:00.030 --> 34:02.590
- REMEMBER SYDNEY?
SHE'S GROWN A LOT.

34:02.690 --> 34:03.964
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR GRANDMA BLANCHE?

34:04.070 --> 34:06.061
[overlapping chatter]

34:11.150 --> 34:12.048
- GOODNESS,
THIS IS SOMETHING.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.425
- I'M SO GLAD
YOU LIKE IT.

34:14.530 --> 34:17.499
- OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
JULIA, THANK YOU.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.114
THAT'S SO USEFUL.

34:20.230 --> 34:21.299
- GRAMS.
- YES.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.982
- THAT'S FROM ME.
- OKAY.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.809
WHAT IS THIS?

34:26.920 --> 34:30.435
- UH, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THERE IS AN EGG COOKER

34:30.550 --> 34:31.619
FOR POACHED EGGS.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.096
IT'S GOT A TIMER ON THERE

34:33.200 --> 34:34.679
SO THAT YOUR EGGS
WON'T BE RUNNY.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.269
- OH.

34:36.380 --> 34:39.372
I HAVEN'T EATEN EGGS
IN YEARS.

34:39.490 --> 34:41.412
THAT WILL BE INTERESTING.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.828
- [chuckles]
- SHE DOESN'T EAT EGGS, CROSBY.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.009
- DO MINE NEXT.
- OKAY.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.031
- OPEN IT.
- OKAY.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.697
OPEN IT?
- AND THEN YOU CAN OPEN THIS.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.041
- [laughs]
- OKAY.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.527
OKAY.

34:51.640 --> 34:54.734
HERE WE GO.
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

34:57.610 --> 35:02.673
IT'S A SNOW GLOBE.

35:02.790 --> 35:05.406
- YAY, I LOVE SNOW GLOBES.
I LOVE THAT ONE.

35:05.510 --> 35:07.091
THAT WAS THE BEST ONE
IN THE STORE.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.966
- LOOK AT THAT.
- SNOWY!

35:11.070 --> 35:13.482
- I PICKED THAT OUT.
- SNOW.

35:13.590 --> 35:16.309
- OH, THANK YOU.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.240
- HEY, WILL YOU COME OUT
IN THE CAR WITH ME?

35:18.350 --> 35:19.521
I NEED SOME HELP
CARRYING SOMETHING.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.279
- I REMEMBER
WHEN WE GOT THAT.

35:21.390 --> 35:23.312
- YEAH.
- GOOD.

35:23.430 --> 35:25.455
- IT'S JUST--YOU KNOW,
IT'S A REALLY HEAW THING.

35:25.570 --> 35:27.356
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING
FOR YOU TO CARRY.

35:27.470 --> 35:28.630
I JUST WANT TO TALK THIS OUT
WITH YOU.

35:28.740 --> 35:32.016
I'M SORRY YOU SAW WHATEVER--
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT WAS.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.256
- NO, NO.
- I KNOW.

35:33.370 --> 35:35.292
I DON'T WANNA BOTHER YOU
ABOUT IT, AND I--

35:35.400 --> 35:36.844
I FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T EVEN TALK
NORMALLY.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.439
I MEAN,
I--I REMEMBER,

35:38.550 --> 35:41.542
IN JUNIOR HIGH,
I SAW MY TEACHER BUYING

35:41.650 --> 35:44.687
1/5 OF VODKA, AND YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD.

35:44.790 --> 35:46.417
AND THIS IS MUCH, MUCH WORSE.
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.899
YOU DIDN'T SEE TEACHER
HAVING SEX WITH MOM, OKAY?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.104
IT'S DIFFERENT
AND BAD.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.144
- LOOK, DREW,
PEOPLE ARE JUST PEOPLE, OKAY?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.763
I'M A PERSON,
AND YOU'RE A PERSON.

35:55.870 --> 35:58.384
AND YOU KNOW, SOME
OF THE PEOPLE THINGS THAT I DO

35:58.500 --> 36:01.628
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT SOMEDAY
OR SOMETHING, AND YOU KNOW,

36:01.740 --> 36:03.731
YOU'RE--YOU KNOW, I KNOW I'M
YOUR MOM, BUT I'M ALSO A--

36:03.850 --> 36:05.181
I'M A PERSON.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.188
- IT'S JUST LIKE MOMS
DON'T HAVE SEX, AND SO--

36:07.300 --> 36:09.325
- I KNOW, BUT AT--
ON THE OTHER HAND,

36:09.440 --> 36:11.670
HERE YOU ARE, SO--
- YES, I'M AWARE.

36:11.790 --> 36:16.022
I'M AWARE, SO, YEAH.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.826
- I GUESS MAYBE
YOU NEED MORE TIME.

36:18.930 --> 36:22.172
- MM-HMM.
YEAH.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.796
- [sighs]
WELL, CAN YOU--

36:26.900 --> 36:28.936
CAN WE AT LEAST TRY TO ENJOY
THE REST OF THE TRIP AND--

36:29.040 --> 36:30.382
- YEAH.
SHOULD WE JUST GO BACK IN?

36:30.490 --> 36:32.629
- CAN I GIVE YOU A H--
HUG?

36:32.740 --> 36:33.968
- LISTEN,
TOMORROW IT'LL BE BETTER.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.638
- TOO SOON?
- YEAH.

36:35.740 --> 36:40.291
- THANKS FOR HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.321
THAT'S NOT
A GOOD HANDSHAKE.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.431
IT'S VERY LIMP.
- YEAH.

36:43.540 --> 36:46.509
- [sighs]

36:46.610 --> 36:48.259
- NO MORE SUGAR.
YOU'RE GONNA GET PINWORMS.

36:48.370 --> 36:49.610
- HEY, YOU'RE GONNA DROP IT.
- MAX, STOP IT, OKAY?

36:49.720 --> 36:51.449
GO PLAY WITH YOUR COUSINS,
PLEASE.

36:51.550 --> 36:52.710
IT'S, LIKE, GRITTY.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.162
- SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN,
GRANDMA BLANCHE?

36:55.280 --> 36:57.066
- OH, JUST FINE.
- YEAH?

36:57.180 --> 36:58.556
- YEAH,
I'M VERY INDEPENDENT.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.241
DON'T NEED MUCH
FUSSING OVER.

37:00.350 --> 37:03.035
COURSE, IT WOULD BE NICE
TO SEE CERTAIN PEOPLE

37:03.150 --> 37:05.766
A LITTLE MORE OFTEN.

37:05.870 --> 37:08.009
- WE'RE HERE NOW, MOM.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.451
- YEAH.

37:09.570 --> 37:15.327
- BUT, UM, DID YOU ENJOY YOUR
PARTY AND YOUR AWESOME GIFTS?

37:15.440 --> 37:17.499
- OH, YES.
THEY WERE GREAT.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.408
OF COURSE, ZEEK FORGOT
AND HAD TO PICK ME UP A HAT

37:20.510 --> 37:22.785
AT THE TOURIST STOP
ON THE WAY HERE.

37:22.890 --> 37:25.336
HE WAS ALWAYS FORGETFUL.

37:25.450 --> 37:26.849
BIT OF A WANDERER.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.474
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE NEVER STAYED IN ONE BUSINESS

37:29.590 --> 37:32.514
VERY LONG, ALWAYS MOVING
FROM PLACE TO PLACE.

37:32.620 --> 37:36.386
- YOU KNOW, HE'S HERE, GRANDMA.
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

37:36.490 --> 37:37.559
- IT'S OKAY, SON.

37:37.660 --> 37:42.666
GIVE IT A REST.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

37:42.770 --> 37:46.319
- YOU KNOW, HE BOUGHT YOU
A REALLY NICE RECLINER

37:46.430 --> 37:49.012
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,
AND HE WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE

37:49.120 --> 37:51.054
TO PUT IT IN THE BACK
OF HIS TRUCK AND ROPE IT DOWN.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.129
AND THEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO WATCH
OVER IT, AND IT WAS STOLEN.

37:54.230 --> 37:58.644
AND IT'S MY FAULT, NOT HIS.

37:58.750 --> 38:01.958
- [sighs]

38:02.070 --> 38:06.348
[door slides open]

38:06.450 --> 38:09.624
[dog barking]

38:15.050 --> 38:17.359
[sighs]

38:17.460 --> 38:18.358
- WHAT'S WRONG?

38:18.460 --> 38:22.089
- IT'S NOTHING, MA.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.399
- CROSBY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE CHAIR.

38:26.510 --> 38:28.364
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

38:28.470 --> 38:31.507
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH A BIG RECLINER ANYWAY?

38:31.610 --> 38:35.159
- IT'S NOT THE CHAIR.

38:35.270 --> 38:37.272
- WELL,
WHAT IS IT THEN?

38:37.380 --> 38:40.099
- [sighs]

38:40.210 --> 38:43.896
YOU KNOW WHAT
I TOLD MY KIDS

38:44.010 --> 38:46.274
EVERY DAY
OF THEIR LIVES?

38:46.390 --> 38:48.073
I MEAN,
ALL FOUR OF THEM,

38:48.180 --> 38:53.868
WHETHER I WAS ANGRY OR
FRUSTRATED OR SAD OR WHATEVER,

38:53.980 --> 38:57.108
YOU KNOW WHAT
I TOLD THEM EVERY DAY?

38:57.230 --> 39:02.577
"I LOVE YOU."

39:05.480 --> 39:07.880
I WANTED IT
TO BE CLEAR TO THEM.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.472
THAT'S WHY
I TOLD THEM.

39:13.590 --> 39:16.206
THEN YOU HURT YOUR HIP,
AND, UM, SUDDENLY I THOUGHT,

39:16.310 --> 39:18.449
JEEZ, I GOTTA GET
THOSE KIDS UP THERE.

39:23.530 --> 39:27.284
MA, THEY ARE THE BEST THING
THAT I HAVE DONE...

39:27.390 --> 39:30.325
WITH MY LIFE...

39:30.430 --> 39:33.604
AND I WANTED YOU
TO SEE THAT.

39:38.030 --> 39:40.749
- THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.

39:43.270 --> 39:46.785
- THANK YOU.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.219
- [sighs]

39:58.320 --> 40:02.324
I LOVE YOU, ZEEK.

40:02.430 --> 40:04.352
OF COURSE I DO.

40:04.470 --> 40:08.361
YOU'RE MY BABY.

40:08.470 --> 40:11.359
[soft rock music]

40:39.810 --> 40:44.884
- DRY YOUR EYES
AND SLEEP

40:44.990 --> 40:49.438
YOU'RE THE SWEAR
I'LL KEEP

40:49.550 --> 40:54.260
HONEY
YOU'LL BE SAFE

40:54.380 --> 40:59.272
HERE WITH ME

40:59.380 --> 41:01.689
HONEY I'LL TRY
