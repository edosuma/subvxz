WEBVTT

00:07.767 --> 00:09.367
Geordie Shore is back.

00:09.433 --> 00:11.533
What the hell is gonna happen
this time?

00:12.667 --> 00:13.967
- Geordie Tours.
- Where?

00:14.033 --> 00:15.067
Across Europe.

00:17.033 --> 00:19.700
What happens on tour stays on
tour.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.767
Bring on the fucking carnage.

00:21.833 --> 00:25.400
- Hard-core double sex.
- Dust this, buck that.

00:25.467 --> 00:28.067
I don't know whether he's gonna
slap his cock in me hands,

00:28.133 --> 00:29.267
or propose to us.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.333
Time I walked away.

00:35.267 --> 00:36.533
Fuck off!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.567
Whoa. Psycho Charlotte is back.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.967
Last night's behaviour
was unacceptable.

00:42.467 --> 00:46.067
Gary's golden boy in Anna's
eyes.
I'm sure he's bucking her.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.633
Who invited Grandmother Willow
to the party?

00:50.700 --> 00:54.500
The cock could have been
inserted
for a couple of seconds.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.867
High fives all round.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.100
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:01.167 --> 01:03.267
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP
edge.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.567
If you look up pulling,
my name's next to it.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.767
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:07.833 --> 01:10.000
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.833
I could talk the legs off a
donkey.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.933
Got the looks, got the charm.
It just works.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.300
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.233
Hardest graft I've done
is doing me hair.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.800
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:32.200 --> 01:35.233
Last night, I met a proper
worldie
and had some hot tub action.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.433
I don't want her doing the walk
of
shame so I'll sneak her out
early.

01:41.733 --> 01:44.100
So, I'm waking up and I feel
sick.

01:44.167 --> 01:45.933
I look to the side.
I'm in Scott's bed

01:46.000 --> 01:48.533
and I'm like, "Fuck, not again."

01:48.600 --> 01:51.767
I didn't sleep with Holly.
We just had a bit of fun, as
usual.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.433
She's a good mate of mine.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.400
My breakup with Ricci is still
really fresh in my mind.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.700
Me head's all over the shop

01:57.767 --> 02:01.000
and I just don't know what I
would
say to him if I spoke to him.

02:01.067 --> 02:04.667
With Charlotte out of the house,
it does feel so quiet.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.767
And even though I had a free
pass
last night, it didn't feel
right.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.600
Morning, guys.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.667
Scott hasn't listened
to any of me advice.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.533
He ran and got straight
in bed with Holly.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.000
Don't come crying to me
when it all goes tits up.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.333
- Aye.
- Like, really badly.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.800
I thought it was inevitable.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.800
I personally think
it's a little bit sad.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.733
But not as sad as Dan
and his grandma.

02:34.067 --> 02:37.300
Oh, no. No, no, It sort of
happened,
but it sort of didn't. But...

02:39.067 --> 02:43.067
As usual, everybody wants to
know
what Casanova got up to last
night.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.267
But a real gentleman never
tells.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.100
Well, maybes just a little bit.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.667
No, it was... inserted.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.633
"Inserted"?
What is he, a fucking tampon?

03:13.700 --> 03:14.900
Hi again.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.533
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Vicky.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.767
Hi, Char.

03:17.833 --> 03:20.767
Anna's allowed us to come
back into the house. Buzzing.

03:27.367 --> 03:28.700
Although I do miss Charlotte,

03:28.767 --> 03:31.567
her coming back this soon
is the last thing I expected.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.833
I hope she's sorted herself out,

03:33.900 --> 03:36.600
cos the last thing I want
is to get back in the ring with
her.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.500
Have you thought about what you
done?

03:38.567 --> 03:41.400
- Yeah.
- You little fucking psycho.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.100
I've walked back in,
and I'm so relieved Gary isn't
there.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.300
I need to find out
what's been happening.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.267
- Holly shagged Scott.
- I never!

03:50.333 --> 03:51.567
She did...

03:53.733 --> 03:56.300
You know when you, like,
bounce it with your mouth?

03:56.367 --> 03:58.400
For, like, a couple of seconds.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.900
- Right, what have you been
doing?
- Shagging his ma.

04:02.467 --> 04:05.800
Scott inserted his penis
into Holly's vagina?

04:05.867 --> 04:07.800
And Dan shagged a GILF?

04:07.867 --> 04:10.633
Obviously the bucking master
must have pulled.

04:11.867 --> 04:13.000
Ha, ha.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.500
A free pass night
and he didn't pull?

04:17.600 --> 04:20.700
Everyone knows you're not a bad
person, that you and Gary argue

04:20.767 --> 04:22.533
and sometimes it gets very
heated.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.433
We have to work out
why you keep acting this way...

04:25.500 --> 04:26.467
I was jealous.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.867
- You were jealous?
- Yeah.

04:30.233 --> 04:33.500
Whilst I've been gone, I've been
thinking a lot about what I've
done.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.933
And I know I need to go up to
Gary
and apologise

04:36.000 --> 04:38.133
because I feel so awful about
it.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.933
Hi.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.300
Thanks. I'm happy to see you as
well.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.833
OK.

04:49.900 --> 04:53.000
Hope he washes his cock after
dipping it in Holly's sewage
pipe.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.933
Charlotte walks in.
It's not only a relief to see
her,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.933
it's a relief to see her
not holding a lamp

05:00.000 --> 05:01.700
and actually coming in peace.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.567
I am sorry, you know.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.133
No, I really am sorry.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.667
Like, I didn't ever mean the
light
to hit you in the face.

05:10.733 --> 05:14.000
I'm over the moon Charlotte's
apologised and she's remorseful.

05:14.067 --> 05:17.000
However, I think now,
I need to keep me distance

05:17.067 --> 05:18.633
cos I cannot have it happen
again.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.167
Sorry. I shouldn't have
flung the light off your head.

05:21.233 --> 05:24.100
It won't happen again.
I won't get jealous any more.

05:24.167 --> 05:27.700
For the first time ever, she
actually
admits that she was jealous.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.533
Is this a new thing?

05:37.300 --> 05:38.400
Phone.

05:38.467 --> 05:41.400
Phone calls mean one thing.
Fucking work.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.067
All right?

05:48.733 --> 05:49.733
Again?

05:53.267 --> 05:54.400
Fucking get in.

05:54.467 --> 05:56.067
Anna calls. We're off to
Barcelona.

05:56.133 --> 05:59.100
By the time I finish, it might
as well be Barce-fucking-boner.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.667
You thought Prague was good,
or Amsterdam.

06:03.733 --> 06:05.867
We're going to Barcelona
tomorrow.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.700
Really?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.733
So, while we're in
the Geordie Shore house,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.233
Anna's sent us across Europe
to work for her company

06:12.300 --> 06:13.633
called Geordie Tours.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.633
Like, Prague and Amsterdam,
scatty little stag and hen dos.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.800
Barcelona's actually a nice...
It'll be fucking mint.

06:19.867 --> 06:24.000
Because we're going to
Barcelona,
we need to do Spanish lessons.

06:24.067 --> 06:28.000
And I'm gonna take Vicky
because she is very intelligent.

06:28.067 --> 06:29.867
Just like me.

06:37.433 --> 06:39.233
-  Como estas? Como estas?
-  Hola!

06:39.300 --> 06:41.100
-  Muy bien!
-  Me llamo Diego.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.967
-  Me llamo Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.700
-  Me llamo Vicky.
- Vicky. Nice to meet you guys.

06:45.767 --> 06:49.400
We're at the lesson and there's
a lot
I need to learn before tomorrow.

06:49.467 --> 06:52.333
So, game face on. It's time to
study.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.200
How would you talk to a guy
in Spanish?

06:54.267 --> 06:55.933
What would you say? Come on.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.300
Q'ue tas,  Diego?

06:59.567 --> 07:02.500
I think it's more likely that
Gary's gonna come out as
bisexual

07:02.567 --> 07:05.833
than Charlotte's gonna be
bilingual
by the end of this fucking
lesson.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.600
If you say,
"I wanna have sex with you,"

07:08.667 --> 07:10.667
it's,  "Quiero tener sexo."

07:10.733 --> 07:12.700
-  Quiero...
- So it's...

07:12.767 --> 07:15.600
-  Quiero tener...
-  Quiero tener sexo.

07:15.667 --> 07:18.533
If you put  "contigo"  on the
end,
it's "with you".

07:18.600 --> 07:22.100
Quiero tener sexo contigo?

07:22.167 --> 07:24.833
I am so good at Spanish.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.967
My old Spanish teacher, Mr
Flores,
would be so proud of us.

07:29.033 --> 07:33.067
No, Diego, I can't do the rude
words
and that's all we need to know.

07:33.133 --> 07:36.033
How would you say, "cock
capturers"?

07:36.100 --> 07:38.667
Capturadores del pene.

07:38.733 --> 07:41.733
- Twat.
- Sex right now in the anus.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.867
Ballbag.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.500
Blowjobs.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.667
Meterjo en mi boca.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.067
- Dillhole.
- Skinny prick.

07:49.133 --> 07:51.200
Deep vaginal drilling.

07:51.267 --> 07:54.233
Sexo buena entro como
untar el drijo.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.700
-  Huevon.
-  Huevon.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.900
-  Huevon.
-  Huevon.

07:56.967 --> 07:58.633
- Yeah.
- What's it mean?

07:58.700 --> 08:01.567
"You fucking idiot."
Like, "You twat."

08:01.633 --> 08:04.033
- Ooh, gotta really shout that
one.
-  Huevon!

08:04.100 --> 08:05.200
No,  huevon!

08:05.267 --> 08:07.300
-  Huevon!
-  Huevon!

08:07.367 --> 08:08.633
There you go.

08:08.700 --> 08:12.800
I leave Spanish lesson
feeling so Spanish.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.700
Adios!

08:22.533 --> 08:25.700
I can't believe we've got to be
up
at 5.00am to go to Barcelona.

08:25.767 --> 08:29.700
So there's no clubbing tonight.
It's straight to bed, early
night.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.232
I can't wait to hit Barcelona.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.600
The Bucking Squad need
their international wings.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.366
Why the fuck is it still dark?

08:42.433 --> 08:45.767
I feel as though I've only been
asleep for five fucking minutes.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.800
The fucking tour of Europe
continues.

08:48.867 --> 08:51.433
It is far too fucking early,
though.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.633
I cannot wait to meet
some Spanish birds.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.767
Como te llama? Me llamo  Scotty
T
and I wanna buck you.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.867
Every place we've been to
in Geordie Tours has been shit.

09:09.933 --> 09:13.400
In Amsterdam, I slept with Gary.
We fell out in Prague.

09:13.467 --> 09:17.033
And back in Newcastle,
I flung a lamp in his face.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.933
What is gonna happen in
Barcelona?

09:22.767 --> 09:25.233
We're all packing,
getting ready to go to
Barcelona.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.867
And I think this is the perfect
time

09:26.933 --> 09:29.133
to test Holly on some of
our Spanish phrases.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.700
We learnt proper wicked things
that we're actually gonna use.

09:32.767 --> 09:36.433
-  Casadores del pene.
- Cock capturers.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.033
Cock Capturers. Well done.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.433
Vicky and Charlotte
are testing me on Spanish,

09:40.500 --> 09:42.600
and I can't believe how good I
am.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.100
Tiero en mi boca.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.367
Does that mean
"I wanna suck you off"?

09:46.433 --> 09:48.867
- Yeah!
- How the hell did you know
that?

09:48.933 --> 09:50.433
If you learn nothing else,

09:50.500 --> 09:52.300
- make sure you learn that one.
- OK.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.067
Holly is getting the answers
right.

09:54.133 --> 09:59.833
I think the Cock Capturers have
a single bilingual ready to
mingle!

10:01.833 --> 10:05.433
Condoms, check. Lube, check.
Passport, check.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.900
Let's fuck off, get on that
plane
and gan to Spain.

10:20.933 --> 10:24.533
Fucking right, boys, let's have
it.
Barcelona, here we fucking go.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.333
Barca, Barca, Barcelona
Barcelona, Barcelona

10:36.933 --> 10:40.167
I know I should be excited,
but all I can think about is
Ricci.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.500
Right now, I feel like...
I just wanna fucking get drunk.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.533
Vicky's thinking about Ricci.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.267
Charlotte's thinking about Gaz.
Which leaves Holly and Scott.

10:49.333 --> 10:52.667
I find him attractive and I
fancy him
and I think he's a lovely
person,

10:52.733 --> 10:57.200
but I would never, ever
want anything more. Never.

10:57.267 --> 10:59.900
Everyone thinks
I'm starting to fall for Scotty
T,

10:59.967 --> 11:01.433
but they don't understand.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.900
I only get with him
when there's no other options.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.800
Barcelona!

11:19.400 --> 11:22.333
- Are you excited?
- Yeah. I can't wait.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.833
Just keep your mind off
that certain one.

11:26.967 --> 11:28.633
- Yeah.
- Good.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.267
We're on the plane to Barcelona,

11:30.333 --> 11:33.033
and Vicky's telling us how
she's gonna keep us away from
Gary

11:33.100 --> 11:35.467
cos she doesn't want us
to get hurt again.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.867
Let's just drink and have fun
and forget it, eh?

11:37.933 --> 11:39.033
Yeah.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.533
Yeah.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.767
Vicky's telling us
to stay away from Gary,

11:44.833 --> 11:47.267
but as much as I try,
it just never works out that
way.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.200
Round three in Barcelona.

11:52.267 --> 11:55.233
I feel like I'm in a porn film.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.400
- Think this might be the shag
pad?
- Get in, Dan.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.500
I need you and Vicky today
for work.

12:00.567 --> 12:02.367
It sounds canny fucking good.

12:02.433 --> 12:04.033
Let's go, bitches!

12:05.533 --> 12:07.667
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:22.433 --> 12:26.333
Geordie Shore, back on tour.
Round three in Barcelona.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.767
Oh! There's a restaurant.

12:36.833 --> 12:40.467
So, we get to where we're
staying,
and it's a big fuck-off villa.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.333
After a canal boat in Amsterdam,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.733
this villa looks like
fucking Buckingham Palace.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.933
It's got about nine bedrooms,
it's got a swimming pool,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.033
it's got a Jacuzzi,
and so many crazy chairs.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.767
I feel like I'm in a porn film.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.967
Oh, my God!

12:56.033 --> 12:59.000
It is absolutely amazing.
But the lads are nowhere to be
seen.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.800
They're probably arguing
over who's gonna buck who

13:01.867 --> 13:03.267
and where they're gonna do it.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.967
Think this might be the shag
pad?

13:05.033 --> 13:07.067
I've never seen so many rooms
I wanna christen

13:07.133 --> 13:09.033
and I haven't even been outside
yet.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.867
Anna must be absolutely mental,
letting us stay here.

13:11.933 --> 13:13.100
Shit!

13:13.167 --> 13:14.700
Oh, my God.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.200
- Oh, my God!
- Sorted.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.900
What you gonna do now
that Charlotte's back?

13:25.967 --> 13:27.900
What's happening, Gaz?
What's going on?

13:27.967 --> 13:29.600
I'm talking to Gaz at the pool,

13:29.667 --> 13:32.400
and I just want to make sure
that is it with him and
Charlotte.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.200
I don't want him to hurt her
any more.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.833
That's my conclusion.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.633
I think you've just got to tell
her.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.800
To be honest, she is single
and she will go out,

13:42.867 --> 13:45.600
but while you're here,
you're on her mind.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.867
It's like you come first a bit.

13:47.933 --> 13:49.700
Speaking to Sophie always helps

13:49.767 --> 13:52.267
cos she understands my point of
view
and Charlotte's,

13:52.333 --> 13:53.633
she has from the start.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.500
All she's saying is the bed
sharing
has to stop, and I agree.

13:56.567 --> 13:59.033
No bed sharing
and a lot less contact.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.900
She says she doesn't wanna
feel awkward.

14:06.733 --> 14:10.833
I've never been so happy to see
Dan.
That was getting way too
serious.

14:10.900 --> 14:14.267
I've only been in Barcelona
two minutes, for fuck's sake.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.867
It's fucking freezing.

14:16.933 --> 14:20.833
Fuck me, me Jacobs have gone to
Tic Tacs. This pool is not
heated.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.500
- Good.
- Get in, Dan.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.667
It's not funny any more.

14:33.967 --> 14:36.400
What's going on
with Charlotte and Gary?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.333
While everyone's unpacking,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.433
I decide that I need to have a
word
with Scotty,

14:43.500 --> 14:45.000
because I'm sick and tired

14:45.067 --> 14:47.033
of everyone saying
that I'm falling for him.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.167
And I just hope that he
understands
that I'm not.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.733
So, Holly's grabbed me for a
chat

14:51.800 --> 14:54.267
and she says she wants to talk
about Gaz and Charlotte,

14:54.333 --> 14:56.467
but I know that she really
wants to talk about me.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.033
Hashtag Heartthrob.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.600
If we're both drunk
and we don't pull anybody
else...

15:06.433 --> 15:07.600
Yeah, exactly.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.367
The relationship between me and
Scott compared to Gary and
Charlotte

15:14.433 --> 15:15.600
is completely different,

15:15.667 --> 15:18.700
cos from day one,
Gary and Charlotte have been in
love,

15:18.767 --> 15:21.033
but me and Scotty,
it's just a bit of fun.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.767
You only want what you can't
have.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.500
That's why me and James
went the way that we went,

15:25.567 --> 15:30.000
and that's why Gaz and Charlotte
went the way that they went.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.700
And that's why me and you
have completely just stayed,

15:32.767 --> 15:34.833
like, normal cos it was just...

15:35.933 --> 15:38.700
Me and Holly are talking,
and we've came to the conclusion

15:38.767 --> 15:42.133
that we're not gonna turn out
like
her and James, or Charlotte and
Gaz.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.767
We're just mates
and everything's cush.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.133
Drop your pants.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.600
We've been in Barcelona
five minutes,

15:51.667 --> 15:53.600
and already I can hear
the phone ringing.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.833
I bet it's Anna. Fucking bitch.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.300
Oh, really?

16:01.367 --> 16:04.000
Anna's rang,
and she wants me to go to work.

16:04.067 --> 16:08.267
Obviously, this means she's
forgiven us for wrecking the
house.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.633
Right, OK.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.933
What's the job?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.133
To show a big group of stags
Barcelona.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.567
I can't help but think
that if Ricci was here,

16:22.633 --> 16:25.367
he'd have a problem with us
spending time with these lads.

16:25.433 --> 16:28.500
- Get changed. Let's go.
- OK.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.233
Vicky and Charlotte have gone
on a sightseeing tour.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.900
I'm taking the rest of the house
on my version.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.133
- What the fuck's this?
- These are the cars.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.767
Two people to each one.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.700
- Just blast around Barcelona.
- Let's go, bitches!

16:49.967 --> 16:52.933
Only us,
to tour a city like Barcelona,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.133
would jump in a little
three-wheeler car

16:55.200 --> 16:57.967
with stupid helmets on
and drive 'em around like kids.

17:02.900 --> 17:07.200
We're driving round in little
yellow fucking Noddy cars.

17:07.267 --> 17:08.633
And I can hardly fit in it.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.767
It's like a giraffe trying to
get in
a fucking budgie cage.

17:11.833 --> 17:12.900
Let's go!

17:17.067 --> 17:20.599
These yellow cars are the best
way
to check out the Barcelona
talent.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.967
You can get the wind in your
hair,
wave at the locals.

17:28.032 --> 17:30.400
I'm a better driver
than all of youse!

17:30.467 --> 17:31.600
This is mint.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.233
I want one of these cars to take
back
to Newcastle.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.933
I'm standing outside this great
big
cathedral with Charlotte,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.367
and I should be excited,
but I'm just nervous

17:47.633 --> 17:50.000
at the prospect of spending time
with all these lads.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.933
Pretty good church.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.533
I bet they've got a canny good
mass.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.733
I don't know, but I smell fart.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.567
Me and Vicky are waiting for
the stags and we're feeling
nervous.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.933
But we know that the stags
are probablys gonna be ugly,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.833
cos Anna never finds
a decent bunch of lads.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.100
Until they walk around the
corner!

18:17.167 --> 18:21.267
And there's at least, like,
four or five average ones.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.567
This is gonna be a good fucking
day.

18:23.633 --> 18:26.300
And the only sight I wanna be
showing them is me fanny.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.900
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

18:28.967 --> 18:29.967
As the saying goes,

18:30.033 --> 18:33.333
the best way to get over someone
is to get under someone else.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
There's plenty of choice
for Charlotte.

18:35.467 --> 18:38.200
Basically, I heard youse
wanted to see some sights?

18:38.267 --> 18:41.033
- Yeah.
- There's the sights. You've
seen it.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.000
- Shall we just go and get
pissed?
- Yeah.

18:43.067 --> 18:45.300
- Are you up for it?
- Fucking brilliant. Come on.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.733
So, we show them this great,
big,
massive church right in front of
us,

18:49.800 --> 18:52.267
and say,
"Let's go to the fucking bar."

18:52.333 --> 18:55.467
Cos that's where all of
the good stuff happens.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.300
In here.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.400
- To Ed.
- To Ed and Nora.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.200
Ed! Ed! Ed! Ed!

19:07.267 --> 19:10.633
I've never been to a stag do
because I haven't got a cock.

19:10.700 --> 19:15.333
But even I know that a good stag
do
means drinking games.

19:16.467 --> 19:18.800
The boys are making it
really complicated

19:18.867 --> 19:20.833
with all these fucking rules
and stuff.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.433
One fucking rule even says you
cannot
swear. Absolutely fucking
ridiculous.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.533
Let's do this.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.200
These lads don't understand
that,
in Newcastle,

19:28.267 --> 19:30.700
it's all about downing drinks
and sucking cock.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.800
Down it! Down it! Down it!

19:35.233 --> 19:38.100
Down it! Down it! Down it!

19:39.433 --> 19:40.933
I don't know what this is!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.667
I didn't know that was the rule!

19:43.733 --> 19:46.600
The lads are wicked,
and I look to Charlotte

19:46.667 --> 19:48.867
and she's just got
the biggest smile on her face.

19:48.933 --> 19:53.900
She is genuinely having fun
and that's when it clicks. So am
I.

19:53.967 --> 19:57.933
At this point, me and Charlotte
have got a new game to play. OK?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.167
You need to go to the toilet and
take
everything off but your
underwear.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.600
It's tradition. If you're the
stag,
you're gonna get mugged off.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.900
This was no exception.

20:11.533 --> 20:14.800
Feels so nice
to talk to a group of lads

20:14.867 --> 20:19.367
who aren't just sitting there,
fucking moaning on about bucking

20:19.433 --> 20:22.700
and pulling and birds and all
the rest of the fucking shit
banter.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.433
So, me and Vicky have got
some cling film, wrapping him
up,

20:28.500 --> 20:31.700
and leaving him there
like a little earthworm.

20:31.767 --> 20:34.100
Right, I'm just trying to pat!

20:34.167 --> 20:36.567
- Pat it down!
- Pat him down!

20:36.633 --> 20:40.600
Stag dos are up there with some
of
the best dos you can ever have.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.600
Ed, your pants are here.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.833
It's only right that the stag
gets tortured like a victim

20:46.900 --> 20:48.200
on his stag do.

20:48.267 --> 20:49.833
Congratulations, petal.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.300
This day couldn't be going
any better.

20:57.367 --> 21:00.900
I will not be wiping the smile
off my face until...

21:02.900 --> 21:04.100
...they come on it?

21:05.800 --> 21:07.567
That was such a good night.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.733
Me and Vicky have had
the best day ever.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.633
And I can tell that
Barcelona's looking up.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.967
Can you remember how much fun
we used to have?

21:15.033 --> 21:17.967
Let's go and have more fun
tonight.
Come on.

21:18.033 --> 21:19.267
- Yes!
- Come on!

21:19.333 --> 21:21.800
- It's all about the fun!
- It's all about the fun!

21:21.867 --> 21:23.533
And the moped!

21:25.700 --> 21:28.067
Tonight, Dan, it's on you.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.533
Vicky is back.

21:30.767 --> 21:34.200
Dan, what the hell am I doing
in a tranny bar?

21:34.267 --> 21:37.200
I've only gone and pulled meself
a Spanish cougar.

21:37.267 --> 21:39.067
I fucking love Barcelona.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.333
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:05.700 --> 22:07.033
So, we're all in Barcelona

22:07.100 --> 22:09.600
and the lads have decided to go
out
minus the girls.

22:12.333 --> 22:15.300
The food and the waitresses
are fucking mint.

22:15.367 --> 22:19.200
I thought just the boys would go
and get some scran before
pre-drinks.

22:19.267 --> 22:21.333
It's not often we let Dan
plan anything.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.400
Tonight he's like, "Look, lads,
I've got a wicked bar,
pre-drinks,

22:24.467 --> 22:27.267
there's fit waitresses."
Let's give this boy a chance.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.100
Tonight, Dan, it's on you.

22:36.133 --> 22:39.500
Lads are already away out. Time
for the girls to plan wor night
out.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.300
Me and Charlotte can fill Sophie
in
on the stags.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.833
- What happened today?
- Amazing.

22:44.900 --> 22:48.433
- Best day I've ever had.
- Right, I wanna know more.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.400
I've had such a good day at
work,

22:50.467 --> 22:53.167
and meeting the stags has
totally
taken me mind off Gary.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.233
Just the people we were
knocking about with.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.000
- Banter?
- Such a laugh.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.400
We didn't wanna come home.

22:58.467 --> 23:01.533
So, hearing that Charlotte's
met a new group of lads is
great,

23:01.600 --> 23:04.400
cos she's finding it hard
to be around Gary right now.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.767
And if this keeps her mind off
that bloody parsnip, then boom!

23:15.600 --> 23:17.267
Good. That's what you need.

23:18.533 --> 23:20.367
It's wor first night out in
Barcelona

23:20.433 --> 23:22.767
and we're gonna hit that city
like we're mad at it.

23:27.667 --> 23:31.000
You know what, youse, cos we're
having a night out with the
girls,

23:31.067 --> 23:34.533
let's forget all about the lads
and from this point on,

23:34.600 --> 23:38.367
anyone who mentions one of their
names, has to down a drink.

23:38.433 --> 23:41.067
Sounds pretty simple
and straight forward, right?

23:41.133 --> 23:42.500
How can you go wrong?

23:42.567 --> 23:45.067
Put it this way,
we all ended up fucking mortal.

23:45.133 --> 23:48.100
I get upset now over James
because of the fact that...

23:49.133 --> 23:52.133
Down it! Down it!

23:52.200 --> 23:54.167
Down it! Down it!

23:54.233 --> 23:56.133
First person to mention them was
me.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
To the fucking wankers.

23:58.267 --> 23:59.933
To the wankers!

24:00.000 --> 24:02.767
Fuck's sake, tequila down me
neck.
Mortal already.

24:07.667 --> 24:11.167
First night in Barcelona, I've
been
trusted to sort the venue out.

24:11.233 --> 24:14.567
Hopefully, the waitresses'll be
fit,
or I'm getting fucking ripped.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.267
- Hello.
- This is crackers.

24:16.333 --> 24:20.233
As soon as we walk in,
I know we've got the wrong
location.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.733
Table for four?

24:25.167 --> 24:28.533
Two kisses? Two words.
Adam's apple and stubble.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.400
Dan, what the hell am I doing
in a tranny bar?

24:31.467 --> 24:33.767
I'm starting to worry about Dan
now.

24:33.833 --> 24:38.033
Bring wor here. And the fact
that
I'm sharing a room with him?
Fuck!

24:39.100 --> 24:42.267
I was told that this was
the place to come for girls.

24:46.033 --> 24:49.833
What the fuck? I am never
gonna hear the end of this.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.600
If the food's not nice, your
night
has been a fucking disaster.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.833
Hi.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.033
Relax, honey, relax.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.367
Fuck me, he's got bigger hands
than all of wor put together.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.567
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot, shot!

25:11.833 --> 25:13.200
- Chicas!
- Yes!

25:13.267 --> 25:15.433
All the chicas!

25:15.500 --> 25:17.667
So, me and the girls
are playing a drinking game

25:17.733 --> 25:19.667
where you can't mention
the boys' names.

25:19.733 --> 25:21.833
I'm gonna be the sober one

25:21.900 --> 25:24.233
while all them talk about the
boys
and get mortal.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.567
I changed for Ricci.

25:28.567 --> 25:31.100
I think our little drinking
game has definitely proved

25:31.167 --> 25:32.967
that we think about the lads
too much.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.867
- To the love!
- To the ladies!

25:46.700 --> 25:49.400
The entertainment starts,
and I don't know what to expect.

25:49.467 --> 25:51.733
Now I know I'm in a fucking drag
bar.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.900
Oh, no, no, no!

26:00.967 --> 26:05.033
So, Gaz is getting a bit
of a lap dance off this
bloke/bird.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.100
But I think Scott's getting
jealous.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.467
We all know that's his favourite
job.

26:11.533 --> 26:12.800
I love a lap dance.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.600
I don't want a lap dance from
a man with bigger calves than
me.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.267
Cheers, Dan.

26:20.067 --> 26:23.133
And for once, they're not
just banging on about fanny,

26:23.200 --> 26:25.700
cos there's fucking none in
here.
Just cock.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.833
To be fair, we've had a laugh
with it, got involved,

26:31.900 --> 26:34.100
it has been quite funny.
But enough's enough.

26:34.167 --> 26:36.567
Time to hook up with the girls
and go to a club.

26:54.233 --> 26:56.533
Everyone's in the club,
having a brilliant time,

26:56.600 --> 27:00.033
all back together, and I've told
the
lads we've invited the stag
party.

27:03.767 --> 27:06.133
So, Vicky's just told us
that some bunch of lemons

27:06.200 --> 27:08.033
has been invited to our family
night.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.133
I wonder how they're gonna react
in the presence of fucking Zeus.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.800
The stags have arrived
with roses for us all.

27:16.867 --> 27:18.833
I'm already starting to fancy
one of them.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.500
Looks like it's game on
for the Cock Capturers.

27:21.567 --> 27:25.233
Everyone's together, but I can
see
that our boys are pissed off

27:25.300 --> 27:29.067
because Essex boys walk in
and give the girls a flower.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.633
Are they fucking serious?

27:31.700 --> 27:35.633
These boys have actually just
bought
us flowers. I've never had
flowers.

27:35.700 --> 27:38.733
And if there's a way to make a
girl
suck you off, just buy her
flowers.

27:48.733 --> 27:51.000
How can one rule apply to us
and not to them?

27:51.067 --> 27:53.767
If it was the other way round
and we brought girls in,

27:53.833 --> 27:56.367
you know for a fact the girls
would have something to say.

28:04.533 --> 28:08.600
Right now, I'm absolutely
mortal.
I'm necking on with this boy.

28:08.667 --> 28:09.900
I fucking love Barcelona.

28:10.867 --> 28:14.133
Tonight is amazing. I can
honestly
say I'm having the best time.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.900
I have emerged
from my chrysalis of commitment

28:16.967 --> 28:19.100
into this beautiful social
butterfly,

28:19.167 --> 28:21.767
downing jagerbombs
and dancing on fucking tables.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.867
Vicky is back.

28:23.933 --> 28:26.567
Vicky seems to be having
a mint time without Ricci.

28:26.633 --> 28:28.900
I'm seeing a whole
different side to her.

28:28.967 --> 28:30.433
But I wonder how long it'll
last.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.600
So glad that Ricci's not here
to see it cos it would kill him.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.733
I've only gonna and pulled
myself
a Spanish cougar.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.500
I am on form with these MILFs
at the moment.

28:40.567 --> 28:42.900
International box diver.

28:45.867 --> 28:49.200
Walk on the dance floor,
meet a couple of Barcelona
students.

28:49.267 --> 28:52.633
Everything goes to plan, we're
necking on, they wanna come
back.

28:52.700 --> 28:55.733
Wait, have I been talking to a
girl
without anyone kicking off?

28:59.800 --> 29:02.567
I am so independent.

29:02.633 --> 29:05.133
And the lad I'm dancing with
is so hot.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.900
I think I'm gonna make a move.

29:09.267 --> 29:12.433
Tonight has cheered everyone up,
just because of cock.

29:12.500 --> 29:17.000
I'm absolutely buzzing to see
that
Charlotte is starting to move
on.

29:17.067 --> 29:20.667
I just hope it's not just a big
act
to try and make Gaz jealous,

29:20.733 --> 29:21.967
cos it'll not work.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.933
Shock, Charlotte's
fucking mortal again.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.167
It's time to take her home.
Definitely no sex for her
tonight.

29:31.233 --> 29:33.967
We're gonna leave the Buck Squad
to it, as per fucking usual.

29:36.167 --> 29:39.133
One minute I'm necking on
with this gorgeous lad,

29:39.200 --> 29:41.833
the next I'm being taken home
by Vicky and Sophie.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.733
How the hell did that happen?

29:52.200 --> 29:54.667
Holly's going on about
some lad that she's pulled,

29:54.733 --> 29:58.033
Charlotte's bloody mortal,
the boys are getting with girls.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.133
We may as well be
back in Newcastle.

30:05.267 --> 30:08.200
I'm buzzing. Me and Gaz
are taking these birds home.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.667
And I'm gonna give mine
a private Spanish lesson.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.933
Me and Gaz are back at the house

30:15.000 --> 30:16.833
and we're hoping
we can get these birds in

30:16.900 --> 30:19.500
without the others giving wor
grief.
Hashtag ninja.

30:20.467 --> 30:22.900
I'm lying in a villa,
on a balcony, on a sun lounger,

30:22.967 --> 30:25.633
staring at the stars,
necking on with some bird.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.000
I love Barcelona.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.467
While Gaz is outside
having a cuddle,

30:35.533 --> 30:37.633
I'm straight down to business.
Shock.

30:42.300 --> 30:46.600
Eventually, the bucking squad
have got our international
wings.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.333
Top night.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.433
You're not gonna believe this.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.267
There's ham that's still
on the hoof.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.267
I feel fucking sick.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.733
I should have fucking shares
in Geordie Tours.

31:10.233 --> 31:11.767
I'm so big and clever!

31:11.833 --> 31:14.400
This is it.
I'm going to talk to Gary.

31:14.467 --> 31:15.800
She drops that bombshell.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.500
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:36.667 --> 31:38.533
What a mint first night
in Barcelona.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.933
We all got mortal, the singles
pulled, and no-one kicked off.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.000
Quality.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.433
I had such a good night last
night.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.600
Do you know what? So did I.

31:50.667 --> 31:52.700
I just can't open me eyes today.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.833
Last night was the most
stress-free,
easy night we've had in fucking
ages.

31:57.900 --> 32:02.633
And we both pulled. And why?
Cos the girls were talking to
boys.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.933
- So, did the boys pull last
night?
- Yeah.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.400
Did they bring them back?

32:07.467 --> 32:08.933
- Yeah.
- Did they buck them?

32:10.367 --> 32:12.767
It's the Bucking Squad,
of course they bucked them.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.533
I pulled a girl that lived
in Barcelona. That's good
enough.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.667
- She lived here, so she's
Spanish.
- Yeah.

32:17.733 --> 32:20.833
I think it was Dan saying,
"I've never seen her have..."

32:20.900 --> 32:23.200
"She looked like she was having
so much fun."

32:23.267 --> 32:24.433
What a night.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.433
We've just woke up,
but already it's the afternoon.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.933
So I'm not wasting my day. I'm
gonna
grab some of the others and go
out.

32:36.100 --> 32:39.100
James has dragged us all out of
bed
to go to the market.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.433
There's markets in Newcastle
as well, you know.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.800
They're all the fucking same.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.167
Dan, you're not gonna believe
this.
-

32:48.233 --> 32:50.467
- No way.
- Ham.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.200
So, we're having a cheeky dig
through the market

32:53.267 --> 32:57.200
and what do we find? A ham
stall.
Buzzing.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.600
Not just any ham,
all different sorts of ham.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.533
We all know just how much
Dan loves ham.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.900
And back in Newcastle, Gaz threw
Dan's last pack at Charlotte.

33:06.967 --> 33:09.500
So it's only fair
if we buy him some more.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.400
Kid in a candy shop.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.100
Why don't you get one with a
foot on?

33:13.167 --> 33:15.233
It's still got a hoof on it!

33:15.300 --> 33:18.867
There's pigs in the window,
like, actual baby pigs.

33:18.933 --> 33:21.067
There's ham that's still
on the hoof.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.133
Get a big bit.

33:25.167 --> 33:26.067
Unreal.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.333
Nice, innit?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.200
That's a pretty good
piece of ham, that.

33:30.267 --> 33:32.867
I feel fucking sick.
I wouldn't dare try that.

33:32.933 --> 33:35.600
It's not even cooked,
it's fresh off the joint.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.467
Do you know what it is,
Charlotte,
I'm gonna buy this for Dan,

33:38.533 --> 33:41.100
but if you have an argument
with Gaz, don't throw it at him.

33:41.167 --> 33:44.667
I think, compared to wafer thin,
that'll probably knock him out.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.833
Visiting this ham shop
has literally made Dan's trip.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.833
He can go home now and be
buzzing.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.900
Cheers.

33:50.967 --> 33:53.533
You've made his week.
You've made his week.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.933
Oh, God.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.600
Guess I'm working.

34:09.433 --> 34:10.433
Hello?

34:12.367 --> 34:13.433
Hi. Yeah, it is.

34:13.500 --> 34:17.067
We've had a nice, relaxing day,
we're all back at the house.

34:17.132 --> 34:19.067
And obviously something's
gotta ruin it.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.667
- Yeah, no bother.
-  All right, then.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.567
-  Thank you, Holly.
- Thanks, Anna. Bye.

34:29.632 --> 34:30.667
Bye.

34:31.867 --> 34:32.900
I'm angry.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.600
Hair done, jeans ironed,
fuck it, off to work.

34:38.667 --> 34:40.467
There might be some
good-looking birds.

34:42.733 --> 34:46.000
I've done a bar crawl in every
single
European city we've been to.

34:46.067 --> 34:48.300
I should have fucking shares
in Geordie Tours.

34:49.433 --> 34:51.600
So, I'm praying that, for once,

34:51.667 --> 34:54.233
it's not just a group of
amazing,
stunning girls,

34:54.300 --> 34:56.667
and for once
that there is good-looking boys.

34:56.733 --> 34:58.100
But it's never gonna happen.

34:58.167 --> 34:59.767
Are youse all ready to get on
it?!

34:59.833 --> 35:03.267
We rock up at work, and the
ratio
of girls to boys is pretty good.

35:03.333 --> 35:05.367
Me and Gaz are absolutely
buzzing.

35:06.367 --> 35:07.800
This is shit.

35:09.767 --> 35:10.667
Everyone!

35:17.833 --> 35:18.933
Holland!

35:19.933 --> 35:22.567
Charlotte and Vicky
get a load of hot stags,

35:22.633 --> 35:24.033
and I get left with these.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.533
What the fuck? Cheers, Anna.
Bitch.

35:28.267 --> 35:29.400
Shot two!

35:30.667 --> 35:32.067
Shot number three!

35:33.033 --> 35:36.200
I'm mortal already, and I'm not
gonna be able to remember
tonight.

35:36.267 --> 35:37.767
Brill. Let's go.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.400
So, I'm getting ready to go out,

35:42.467 --> 35:45.300
but I'm starting to feel
like I really need to talk to
Gary.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.867
Wait a second.
What's Charlotte talking about?

35:53.933 --> 35:56.633
Is this about Gary?
Cos last thing I heard,

35:56.700 --> 35:59.067
they both said it was all right
for each other to pull

35:59.133 --> 36:01.300
and they were gonna stay
out of each other's way.

36:09.133 --> 36:12.233
Now, we all know how she feels,
we know that she gets jealous,

36:12.300 --> 36:15.800
she gets angry, she gets upset
when he pulls other girls.

36:15.867 --> 36:19.800
But for her to tell him that,
that is a different story.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.533
This could go a good way,
or a bad way.

36:30.133 --> 36:33.867
Booze, birds, banter,
Barcelona, bar two. Now.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.333
In here. Get yourselves in.

36:46.467 --> 36:49.367
I'm trying to lead these random
people down this weird street

36:49.433 --> 36:52.333
that I really don't even know
meself,
down to the next bar.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.867
And I'm thinking,
"I'm actually really good at
this."

36:54.933 --> 36:57.667
Then I'm thinking,
"I'm actually really mortal."

37:01.767 --> 37:04.667
For once, I've actually
behaved meself at work.

37:04.733 --> 37:06.467
Anna has got fuck all
to cry on about.

37:06.533 --> 37:08.500
I'm so big and clever!

37:08.567 --> 37:09.767
All in all, it was good.

37:10.700 --> 37:11.867
Oh, steady.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.967
Finished work, I wanna get ready
and get out in Barcelona.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.800
It's the first time
I've ever been to Barcelona

37:22.867 --> 37:26.067
so I'm absolutely buzzing
to get out and get absolutely
mortal.

37:34.033 --> 37:36.267
- Yeah!
- Wicked.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.467
I'm gonna neck on
with some chicos. Chicas.

37:39.767 --> 37:41.867
You want all the penis!

37:41.933 --> 37:44.467
Barcelona

37:44.533 --> 37:46.733
Everyone's in a fucking mint
mood.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.367
Time to go out
and find some fucking wappers.

37:54.967 --> 37:57.567
So, we walk into this bar
and it's unreal.

37:57.633 --> 38:00.167
White leather sofas
overlooking the beach,

38:00.233 --> 38:02.733
you've got little heaters,
cocktails, shots.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.267
- To Barcelona!
- Barca...

38:06.333 --> 38:08.433
- Barcelona passports!
- Geordie Tours!

38:08.500 --> 38:10.233
So, we're all having a mint
night.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.433
And for once, Scott's not
actually
snaking after birds.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.467
But I know for a fact,
once his boyfriend comes back,

38:16.533 --> 38:17.667
it'll all change.

38:17.733 --> 38:19.533
- Come on, down it!
- Down it!

38:21.367 --> 38:24.733
It's great to be out,
but I can't stop thinking about
Gary.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.533
I know I've got something
to tell him,

38:26.600 --> 38:29.433
and I don't know how he'll
react.
It's ruining me night.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.033
- Come on, youse!
- Cracking!

38:32.100 --> 38:35.000
The others turn up from work,
and it's great to see them,

38:35.067 --> 38:37.200
but I know this is
all about to change,

38:37.267 --> 38:40.167
cos Charlotte still needs
to talk to Gaz.

38:40.233 --> 38:42.767
Dan, do you want that
you're in the Bucking Squad,

38:42.833 --> 38:44.567
or that you like gentle sex?

38:44.633 --> 38:48.000
Work's over. Vicky's giving
everyone
Spanish things to learn.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.967
Everyone's together.
Things couldn't be any better.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.800
This is it.
I'm going to talk to Gary.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
All right?

39:01.967 --> 39:04.933
Out of nowhere, Charlotte's
like,
"Gaz, can I have a word?"

39:05.000 --> 39:06.200
And it doesn't look good.

39:12.233 --> 39:13.533
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:14.567 --> 39:16.567
I just felt like
I needed to talk to ya.

39:16.633 --> 39:18.700
Gary's got no idea
what I'm about to tell him.

39:18.767 --> 39:20.900
But I've been feeling
so awkward around him,

39:20.967 --> 39:23.033
I just need to get things
off me chest.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.733
I feel like, lately,
I'm totally spoiling me time
here.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.733
No, shh.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.067
We sit down and she starts
talking

39:31.133 --> 39:33.900
about how she thinks
she's spoiling my time in the
house.

39:33.967 --> 39:37.033
And I see her crying. I hate
Charlotte crying so I stopped
her.

39:45.067 --> 39:47.100
Yeah, I know, and you think
it's so easy...

39:48.567 --> 39:52.433
No, you don't understand...
Gary, you don't understand.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.333
No, no, no, you don't
understand.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.767
Literally, like...

39:57.867 --> 40:01.300
I love ya. And... I always have.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.500
So, I'm finally telling Gary
that I'm in love with him.

40:05.567 --> 40:08.233
And I have been ever since day
one.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.767
And that he's all I've ever
known.

40:10.833 --> 40:14.533
And... without him,
I just... I'm lost.

40:14.600 --> 40:19.100
No matter what I've done
to try and get over ya, I can't.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.667
I literally... Gary, I love ya.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.000
I'm thinking this is just
another
me and Charlotte chat.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.867
She'll say, "I spoil your
nights."
I'm like, "No, let's have fun."

40:30.933 --> 40:32.633
Then she just drops that
bombshell.

40:42.367 --> 40:46.567
I know that he doesn't care
about me
the same way I care about him,

40:46.633 --> 40:50.000
or else he would have stopped
having sex with people ages ago.

40:50.067 --> 40:51.133
But he hasn't.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.800
And I know that.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.233
So I don't want him
to say anything back.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.067
I want to know the truth.

40:57.133 --> 41:01.033
Why did you lead us on? Why did
you
act like you did care about us?

41:01.100 --> 41:03.300
Why do you do
some of the things you do?

41:03.367 --> 41:05.233
I know Gary says
that he cares about us

41:05.300 --> 41:07.667
and that he loves us so much
as a friend,

41:07.733 --> 41:11.733
but after I've told him this,
I don't think anything'll
change.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.067
So he can't care about us that
much.

41:23.733 --> 41:27.233
When she gets up and walks
away...
this is where it starts.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.467
We're not speaking, and I think
this
is the only way we can go
forward.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.533
But I just hope we can
sort something out.

41:33.733 --> 41:37.867
I am just another girl who's
literally fell in love with Gary

41:37.933 --> 41:41.133
and who he doesn't like
and he has to let them down
gently.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.267
And I didn't ever wanna be that.

41:55.533 --> 41:57.867
So, Gaz is back
from talking to Charlotte.

41:57.933 --> 42:01.133
And I can see all the girls are
crying. What the fuck's going
on?

42:04.300 --> 42:06.133
She just said how it was?

42:10.500 --> 42:13.300
Gary's dropped a bombshell.
He said that Charlotte's come
out

42:13.367 --> 42:15.333
and said she loves him.
He looks shocked.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.867
To be fair, I think
it's been coming for a long
time.

42:24.433 --> 42:27.200
For her to tell Gary
everything that she's felt

42:27.267 --> 42:29.800
throughout the whole time
of being in this house

42:29.867 --> 42:31.200
is heart-breaking.

42:36.900 --> 42:41.400
I think it's finally sunk in to
Gaz
just exactly how Charlotte
feels.

42:41.467 --> 42:42.967
And it's about fucking time.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.900
We've all been waiting for this
since
they slept together in
Amsterdam.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.533
I'm surprised it's taken so
long.

42:55.200 --> 42:58.533
After telling the girls
everything
and seeing how they all react,

42:58.600 --> 43:00.833
I know that they're
going to be there for us.

43:06.533 --> 43:08.600
We're back to Newcastle.
I just can't wait.

43:08.667 --> 43:11.600
Boot camp?
I couldn't think of nothing
worse.

43:11.667 --> 43:13.167
Move yourself!

43:14.067 --> 43:16.133
I have to deal
with the Ricci situation.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.000
This is no time to go home
with your bird and get
breastfed.

43:22.167 --> 43:26.033
We wanna have the most massive
and epic house party in history.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.900
I'm giving him the best BJ
a DJ could ever have.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.300
I'm having a wicked time,
and everyone's just pure kicking
off.

43:35.700 --> 43:36.633
Fuck off!
