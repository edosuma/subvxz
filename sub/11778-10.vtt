BAD DECISIONS.

{\an8}- ACCURACY IS BEING ABLE

04:18.591 --> 04:22.136
{\an8}EXACTLY AND PRECISELY
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.180

YOU MUST TATTOO

04:24.263 --> 04:26.391
A PART OF THE BODY
THAT IS SO DELICATE,

04:26.474 --> 04:29.644
ACCURACY
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL--

04:29.727 --> 04:32.438

05:12.186 --> 05:14.272

05:14.355 --> 05:17.400

05:17.483 --> 05:18.401
{\an8}IF YOU GO JUST A HAIR
TOO DEEP,

05:18.484 --> 05:21.946
{\an8}YOU CAN SCREW
SOMEONE'S VISION UP.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.073

ASSIGNED A CANVAS

05:24.157 --> 05:27.493
AND HAVE 60 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE YOUR EYELID TATTOO.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.080

05:35.752 --> 05:37.754
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DEFINITELY
WANT TO DO, RIGHT?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.255

05:39.338 --> 05:41.174
- WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.425
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.761
{\an8}- THE EXECUTION
OF THE EYELID TATTOOS

05:44.844 --> 05:47.138
{\an8}REQUIRE ONE MAJOR THING--
THAT IS ACCURACY.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.348
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS
THING TO DO.

05:49.432 --> 05:49.932
YOUR MOVES HAVE TO BE PRECISE.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.603
YOU GET ONE SHOT.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.438
- I'VE BEEN WANTING
THIS TATTOO FOREVER.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.939
I COULDN'T GET
NO ARTIST TO DO IT.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.441
HAVE YOU DONE EYELIDS BEFORE?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.610
- I HAVE NOT, BUT I'VE BEEN
TATTOOING 17 YEARS,

06:00.693 --> 06:02.945
SO I WOULDN'T BE WORRIED.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.781
{\an8}THE COMPETITION'S
RAMPING UP,

06:04.864 --> 06:06.574
{\an8}BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY
STILL LOW-HANGING FRUIT.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.076
JASON AND JOSH AND KYLE--

06:08.159 --> 06:09.285
I DON'T THINK
THAT THEY'RE COMPETING

06:09.368 --> 06:10.536
AT THE LEVEL
THAT I COMPETE AT.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.579
- THAT'S PERFECT.
- IS THAT GOOD?

06:11.662 --> 06:12.955
- PERFECT.
- IT'S PERFECT.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.625
- IT'S TIME FOR PEOPLE
TO GET KNOCKED OFF.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.628
{\an8}- THE OTHER ARTISTS DON'T EVEN
CONSIDER ME A THREAT.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.463
{\an8}- YOU NERVOUS?
- A LITTLE BIT.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.256
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO WIN A FLASH CHALLENGE

06:22.340 --> 06:25.468
SO I CAN SHOW THESE GUYS
THAT I'M ACTUALLY IN THIS GAME

06:25.551 --> 06:26.928
AND I'M A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.721
I GOT TO PUT IT UP
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.306
IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:30.389 --> 06:32.016
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET?
- AN "L" AND A "4."

06:32.100 --> 06:33.476
MY LAST NAME'S LEYVA,
AND THEN I HAVE

06:33.559 --> 06:35.019
TWO OLDER BROTHERS,
YOUNGER SISTER, AND ME,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.979
SO THERE'S FOUR OF US.
- OH, THAT'S COOL.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.189
IT'S FOUR OF US, TOO,

06:38.272 --> 06:40.108
AND THAT'S WHY
I GOT THE "K" ON MY FACE.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.068
ALL OF OUR NAMES
START WITH A "K."

06:42.151 --> 06:46.197
{\an8}I'M SO SCARED OF POKING
SOMEBODY'S EYEBALL OUT.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.533
BUT IF I CAN TATTOO
ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE BODY,

06:48.616 --> 06:50.827
THERE'S NO REASON WHY I CANNOT
TATTOO AN EYELID.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.411
- GARGOYLE
ON YOUR EYELIDS, HUH?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.455
- [laughs] YEAH.
- THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.706
THAT'S THE BEST
THAT YOU COULD THINK OF?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.917
- G-A-R-G-O-Y-L-E.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.168
- I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY
AGAINST TATTOOING FACES.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.170
I JUST DON'T FEEL,
LIKE, COMFORTABLE WITH IT,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.589
NOT, LIKE, PHYSICALLY,
BUT JUST MORALLY.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.507
SO TO HAVE THAT ON YOUR EYELIDS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

07:04.590 --> 07:06.342
I WOULD SAY
IS A HUGE MISTAKE.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.885
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.303
- WELL, I'VE HAD THIS
SINCE I WAS 16, SO I DON'T--

07:09.387 --> 07:10.680
- I MEAN WHAT I DO ON YOU.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.223
- IT'S MORE
ABOUT BRANDING MYSELF,

07:12.306 --> 07:13.224
AND I ALREADY HAVE.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.185
{\an8}- I WANT TO MAKE SURE

07:16.269 --> 07:18.104
{\an8}INSANELY CONFIDENT THAT
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.857

I'M JUST GONNA MAKE SURE
I DON'T [bleep] THAT FACE UP.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.847
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:52.930 --> 07:54.056

07:54.140 --> 07:56.809

07:57.894 --> 08:00.313

08:08.237 --> 08:10.239

08:10.323 --> 08:13.659
MY IDEA IS TO HIDE TWO LITTLE

ARE HALF OPEN,

08:41.979 --> 08:44.732
IT'S WEIRD AS HELL, MAN.

MY EYES DON'T WORK.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.541
- JOSHUA'S TATTOO
LOOKS TERRIBLE.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.962
{\an8}I CAN'T READ IT,
AND IF I CAN'T READ IT,

09:06.045 --> 09:07.546
{\an8}THEN IT'S USELESS.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.299
HOW WAS THE EXPERIENCE
FOR YOU, KYLE?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.801
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME
DOING EYELIDS.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.094
- I TRIED TO KEEP 'EM

09:13.177 --> 09:14.095
WHERE SHE'D BE ABLE
TO HOLD A JOB

09:14.178 --> 09:16.222
AS LONG AS SHE KEPT
HER EYES OPEN.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.640
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THEY KIND OF DISAPPEAR A BIT.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.810
- THEY'RE VERY SMALL, VERY
DELICATE, AND VERY ACCURATE.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.604
THE CLEAN, TIGHT OUTLINE THAT
YOU PUT ON THOSE REALLY WORKS.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.481
NICE JOB.
- JIME.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.733
- YOU REALLY WENT ABOVE
AND BEYOND TO DO THE CURSIVES.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.319
YOU MADE EVEN SOME LITTLE
BEVELED EDGES IN THERE.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.321
THIS THING LOOKS AS GOOD
AS A TATTOO

09:32.405 --> 09:33.531
THAT WOULD BE
ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE BODY.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.657
- THANK YOU.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.992
- JOSHUA.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.451
- I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES
YOU HAVE WITH THE ACCURACY

09:37.535 --> 09:39.036
IN THIS THING
IS FROM CONFIDENCE.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.037
- TATTOOING PEOPLE'S FACES

09:40.121 --> 09:41.747
IS SOMETHING
THAT I WOULD NEVER DO

09:41.831 --> 09:42.999
IN ANY OTHER SITUATION.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.500
- BUT YOU HAVE A CANVAS HERE

09:44.583 --> 09:46.002
WHO'S GOT PLENTY
OF FACE TATTOOS.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
THAT HAD TO BE AT LEAST
SOMEWHAT COMFORTING FOR YOU.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.381
- IF I SET UP WITH ANY
OF THE OTHER CANVASES,

09:50.464 --> 09:52.008
I WOULD HAVE FORFEITED
THIS CHALLENGE.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.634
- WELL, JOSH, I THINK
YOU HAVE "JUSTFUL" RESERVATIONS

09:53.718 --> 09:56.554
ON DOING FACE TATTOOS,
AND I RESPECT THAT,

09:56.637 --> 09:58.681
BUT THE BIG THING HERE
IS ACCURACY.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.143
THE SECOND PART OF THE WORD
IS A LOT CLOSER TO THE EYELID

10:02.226 --> 10:03.352
AND THE OTHER SIDE COMES
A LITTLE HIGHER UP.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.856
I DON'T THINK YOUR ACCURACY
WAS ON POINT.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.775
- TATU BABY, HOW WAS IT
FOR YOU TO TATTOO THE EYELIDS?

10:09.859 --> 10:10.776
- IT WAS CHALLENGING.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.361
HE WANTED IT REALLY SMALL,

10:12.445 --> 10:13.237
AND HE DIDN'T WANT
FOR YOU TO SEE IT

10:13.321 --> 10:15.656
WHEN HE HAD HIS EYES OPEN.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.116
- I THINK YOU DID A REALLY
ACCURATE JOB OF PLACING IT.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.703
AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DESIGN,
VERY CLEAN, VERY LEGIBLE.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.372
- THIS GUY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER TATTOOS.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.291
{\an8}IF I WOULD HAVE GOT ASSIGNED
THIS CANVAS,

10:25.374 --> 10:28.127
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

10:28.210 --> 10:29.837
{\an8}TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.881
- JASON.
- I REALLY LIKE THE WAY

10:31.964 --> 10:33.132
THEY FIT ON THE EYE.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.300
OBVIOUSLY, YOUR CANVAS
WANTED IT TO BE SHOWN

10:34.383 --> 10:36.552
WHEN HIS EYES ARE OPEN.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.804
AND ACCURACY, MAN--
VERY CLEAN LINE WORK.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.514
- IT'S THE TOUGHEST OUTLINE
YOU'VE HAD TO DO YET,

10:40.598 --> 10:43.559
AND YOU HIT IT.
- OH, MY GOD.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.311
{\an8}I MIGHT EVEN
BE ABLE TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.520
- JOEY.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.481
I FIGURED THIS WAS GONNA BE
A BREEZE FOR YOU.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.232
IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH,
AND IT'S NOT AS ACCURATE

10:50.316 --> 10:52.568
AND AS TIGHT AS A LOT OF LINES
WE'VE SEEN YOU DO.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.820
- AS FAR AS HITTING THE MARK
AGAINST EVERYBODY ELSE,

10:54.904 --> 10:56.238
NOT THE BEST DAY.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.950
- TURNS OUT JOEY'S NOT AS GOOD
AS HE MAY THINK HE IS.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.160
EVERYBODY HAS A WEAKNESS
IN THIS GAME...

11:01.243 --> 11:03.746
EVERYBODY.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.082
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
ACCURACY CHALLENGE--

11:06.165 --> 11:07.208
EYELIDS.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.751
I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED
TO SEE

11:08.834 --> 11:10.378
WHO I THOUGHT
WAS THE BOTTOM OF THE DAY--

11:10.461 --> 11:11.879
TWO OF OUR
STRONGER TATTOOERS.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.089
- JOSH AND JOEY.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.549
JOSHUA'S TATTOO,
IT'S VERY UN-LEGIBLE.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.593
THERE'S TWO "G"s IN THE WORD,

11:17.676 --> 11:18.427
AND THOSE TWO "G"s
DO NOT LOOK THE SAME.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.554
THAT IS NOT ACCURACY.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.556
- JOEY'S NOT FAR OFF
OF JOSHUA.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.892
A LITTLE MORE LEGIBLE,
BUT IT'S SUPER SHAKY,

11:24.975 --> 11:25.935
VERY INACCURATE.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.812
- IF YOU LOOK AT SYMMETRY,

11:27.895 --> 11:30.731
JOEY HAD TWO EYELIDS,
BOTH WITH FOUR LETTERS,

11:30.815 --> 11:32.108
AND THEY LOOK
WOBBLY AS HELL,

11:32.191 --> 11:34.693
WHEREAS YOU LOOK AT JIME
WHO DID THE "DEJA VU,"

11:34.777 --> 11:37.196
ONE EYELID HAD FOUR LETTERS,
THE OTHER EYELID HAD TWO,

11:37.279 --> 11:39.782
AND HE MADE THEM SIT
IN A SYMMETRICAL FASHION.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.118
- JIME AND JASON ARE THE ONLY
REALLY TWO PEOPLE

11:42.201 --> 11:44.412
THAT GOT REAL ACCURATE,
PRECISE LINES.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.122
- I WAS SURPRISED
JASON PULLED THIS OFF.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.749
- MR. ROUGH OUTLINES
THROUGHOUT THE COMPETITION,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.168
AND THE GUY COMES OUT AND DOES
AN EYELID AND DOES IT CLEAN.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.129
- I THINK WE HAVE
A DECISION HERE.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.672
- YEAH.
- LET'S DO IT.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.009
TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW ACCURACY

11:59.093 --> 12:02.221
BY TATTOOING A VERY SMALL,
DELICATE CANVAS--

12:02.304 --> 12:04.473
THE EYELIDS.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.308
SOME OF YOUR TATTOOS
LOOKED VERY SHARP.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.685
JIME.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.146
- YOU WENT IN, YOU DID
VERY PRECISE LINE WORK,

12:10.229 --> 12:11.981
AND PLAYING WITH THE SIZE
SO THAT,

12:12.064 --> 12:13.691
EVEN THOUGH YOU AHD
FOUR LETTERS ON ONE SIDE

12:13.774 --> 12:15.317
AND TWO ON THE OTHER,
IT STILL LOOKED VERY BALANCED.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.361
GREAT ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.529
- THANK YOU.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.864
- JASON.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.907
- YOUR TATTOO CAME OUT
REALLY, REALLY CLEAN.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.868
YOUR LINE WORK LOOKED
ALMOST FLAWLESS

12:23.951 --> 12:24.827
ON THIS EYELID.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.454
YOU SEEMED
VERY COMFORTABLE TODAY,

12:26.537 --> 12:27.204
AND THAT'S WHERE
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.832
- APPRECIATE IT.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.167
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

12:31.250 --> 12:33.627
THAT THE WINNER

DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.225
THERE'S NO OTHER SITUATION

13:29.308 --> 13:31.268
COMFORTABLE
TATTOOING SOMEBODY'S FACE.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.728
I THINK IT'S A [bleep]
HUGE MISTAKE.

I THINK IT'S STUPID.
I THINK PEOPLE THAT ARE

13:33.854 --> 13:35.773
DOING THAT END UP
[bleep] THEIR LIFE OVER.

13:35.856 --> 13:36.607

LET ME TALK, OKAY?
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.408

HITS A SWITCH

13:46.492 --> 13:48.327
AND GOES BERSERK.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.163

THAT YOU'RE A TATTOO ARTIST

13:51.247 --> 13:52.581
AND YOU HAVE TATTOOS
ON YOURSELF,

13:52.665 --> 13:53.749

13:53.832 --> 13:55.584
BECAUSE THE HAVE
A FACE TATTOO.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.919
- SHE LETS IT ALL OUT

- WHO THE [bleep] ARE YOU
TO CALL IT STUPID?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.382
- BECAUSE I KNOW--
- YOU DON'T KNOW [bleep].

14:01.465 --> 14:02.967
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU'RE
SCREWING YOURSELF OVER

"OH, IT'S SO COOL
TO GET MY FACE TATTOOED."

14:13.852 --> 14:16.814
- WE'RE NOT ROLE MODELS.
WE'RE [bleep] TATOOERS, MAN.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.649
WE CAN TATTOO OUR FACE.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.651
THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE
THIS CAREER,

14:20.734 --> 14:21.944

- SHUT IT.
YOU DID JUST JUDGE HER

14:28.492 --> 14:29.868
FOR HER CHOICES.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.870
YOU JUST DID IT.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.289

{\an8}HE'S BEEN TATTOOING

15:34.099 --> 15:36.393
{\an8}WAY BEFORE I EVEN
STARTED TATTOOING,

15:36.477 --> 15:38.646

ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.858

WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.943

16:22.690 --> 16:25.901
IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE DONE A PORTRAIT.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.487
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.247
- YOU MAY BE WONDERING
WHY THERE ARE SO MANY CANVASES.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.457
{\an8}- PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
I HAVE TO DO TWO PORTRAITS.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.918
- WELL, TODAY YOU CAN BE
EVEN MORE ACCURATE,

16:43.001 --> 16:45.170
BECAUSE NOT ONLY WILL YOU
HAVE A PHOTO,

16:45.254 --> 16:47.589
BUT YOU'LL ALSO HAVE
THE REAL DEAL.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.592
YOUR CANVASES HAVE BROUGHT
THE SUBJECTS

16:50.676 --> 16:52.261
FOR THEIR
ELIMINATION TATTOOS.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.638
IF YOUR TATTOO
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEM,

16:54.722 --> 16:56.306
THEY'LL BE SURE
TO LET YOU KNOW.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.726
{\an8}- DEFINITELY GONNA BE A LITTLE
BIT STRESSFUL HAVING THE PERSON

16:58.809 --> 17:00.811
{\an8}THAT I'M ACTUALLY GONNA BE
TATTOOING THERE, WATCHING ME.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.646
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.772
PLEASE INTRODUCE
THE SUBJECT OF YOUR PORTRAIT.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.401
- I'D LIKE TO GET A PORTRAIT
OF MY GREAT FRIEND JAKE.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.819
- THE GUY HAS GLASSES,
A HAT, AND A BEARD.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.655
{\an8}THERE'S SO MUCH DETAIL
GOING ON.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.450
- I WOULD LIKE TO GET A PORTRAIT
OF MY FIANCE, ADRIAN.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.161
- I'D LIKE TO GET A PORTRAIT
OF MY HUSBAND, ALAN.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.328
- I WOULD LIKE TO GET A PORTRAIT
DONE OF MY MOM.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.123
- I DON'T WANT TO DO
ALL THE WRINKLES IN IT.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.916
{\an8}THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS PLAY OUT
WELL AS A TATTOO.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.794
- I'D LIKE TO GET A PORTRAIT
OF MY MOTHER HERE.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.628
- MY NAME IS SIERRA,
AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET

17:27.713 --> 17:29.298
A PORTRAIT OF DAVE NAVARRO.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.550
- WHOA!

17:31.633 --> 17:33.844
[laughter and applause]
WHAT?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.137
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.430
- NO.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.973
{\an8}- I-I CAN'T--

17:38.057 --> 17:39.683
{\an8}I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE'S
GETTING A PORTRAIT OF ME.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.517
OH, MY GOD.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.978
[laughter]

17:43.061 --> 17:46.315
WHICH LUCKY ARTIST
WILL THAT GO TO?

17:46.398 --> 17:49.067
ALL RIGHT. JIME, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE

17:49.151 --> 17:52.821
AND NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.239
CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.201
{\an8}- I DO A REALLY ANIMATED
STYLE OF TATTOOING,

17:57.284 --> 17:59.328
{\an8}SO THIS IS BASICALLY OPPOSITE
OF WHAT I'M KNOWN FOR.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.913
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I GRAB THE CANVAS

18:00.996 --> 18:02.206
THAT'S GONNA BE BEST FOR ME,

18:02.289 --> 18:03.665
THAT'S GONNA TAKE ME
TO THE NEXT ROUND.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.583
WHERE ARE YOU LOOKING
TO DO IT?

18:04.666 --> 18:06.543
- UH, THE OUTSIDE
OF MY LOWER LEG.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.384
- BLACK AND GRAY
ON EITHER SHOULDER AND THE BACK

18:14.468 --> 18:16.011
{\an8}- ME BEING
A PORTRAIT ARTIST,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.846
{\an8}THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO REDEEM MYSELF

18:17.930 --> 18:20.557
{\an8}FOR ANY LITTLE MISTAKE
THAT I HAVE MADE.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.018
I REALLY WANT TO WIN
THIS PORTRAIT CHALLENGE.

18:23.101 --> 18:26.563
- HEY, JIME, YOUR HAIR
LOOKS REAL NICE TODAY, BRO.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.606
LOOKING LIKE KING
UP THERE, MAN.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.691
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:29.775 --> 18:32.194
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:32.277 --> 18:32.945
- "JOEY."

18:33.028 --> 18:35.447
- "TATU BABY."
- HEY.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.074
I'M SO EXCITED.
THE PICTURE IS BADASS.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.827
{\an8}PLAIN AND SIMPLE,
I'M GONNA NAIL IT

18:39.910 --> 18:41.370
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M GOOD AT IT.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.621
- "JIME."

18:42.704 --> 18:45.249
- WOW.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
- I'M NOT AFRAID.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.877
- BE VERY AFRAID.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.671
{\an8}- I CHOOSE DAVE NAVARRO'S PHOTO

18:50.754 --> 18:52.005
{\an8}NOT BECAUSE HE'S A JUDGE,
BUT THE FACT

18:52.089 --> 18:54.550
{\an8}THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE PHOTO,
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GONNA BE

18:54.633 --> 18:55.801
{\an8}THE EASIEST ONE FOR ME.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.053
{\an8}- "JOSHUA."

18:58.136 --> 18:58.554
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE A FUN DAY.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.973
{\an8}- "JASON."

19:01.056 --> 19:03.475
{\an8}- OF COURSE, I GET STUCK
WITH THE ONE I DIDN'T WANT.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.269
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE
A REALLY HARD CHALLENGE.

19:05.352 --> 19:05.894
{\an8}- "KYLE."
- OH, GOD.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.063
{\an8}JIME JUST [bleep] ME.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.731
{\an8}I GET THE OLDEST,
THE ABSOLUTE HARDEST ONE TO DO.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.067
{\an8}I AM SCREWED.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.903
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.239
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:17.322 --> 19:18.824
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST

19:18.907 --> 19:21.201
AND PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.537
YOU HAVE THE REST
OF THE EVENING TO CONSULT

19:23.620 --> 19:24.371
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.624
TOMORROW
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:27.708 --> 19:29.084
TO COMPLETE
YOUR PORTRAIT TATTOO.

19:29.167 --> 19:33.130
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.089
GOOD LUCK.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.758
{\an8}- TO DO A PORTRAIT,
YOUR ACCURACY

19:36.842 --> 19:38.802
{\an8}HAS TO BE 100% ON POINT.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.930
ONE LITTLE DIFFERENCE
IN ANY PART OF A FACE

19:42.014 --> 19:43.390
AND YOUR PORTRAIT
LOOKS COMPLETELY OFF.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.516
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.314
- EVEN IF THE TATTOO
IS PERFECT...

19:50.397 --> 19:52.024
- PERFECTION, YEAH.
- THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,

19:52.107 --> 19:54.902
"WHY DID YOU CUT THIS PIECE OUT
OR NOT THAT?"

19:54.985 --> 19:57.112
YOU FEEL ME?
- YEAH.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.698
- I'M STUNNED.
- I KIND OF FIGURED.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.992
- AND YOU JUST--YOU'RE READY
TO JUST TACKLE THIS THING?

20:02.075 --> 20:05.037
{\an8}- YEAH.
- JIME'S DOING A TATTOO

20:05.120 --> 20:06.580
{\an8}OF ONE OF HIS JUDGES.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.166
THAT'S GOT TO BE
PRETTY INTIMIDATING.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.792
- YOU SEEM MORE NERVOUS
THAN I AM.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.002
I'M NOT NERVOUS, BUT YOU'RE
[bleep] FREAKIN' OUT.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.086
- I'M FREAKIN' OUT BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

20:13.170 --> 20:15.464
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
- MM-HMM.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.842
- AND I WOULD HATE
TO TARNISH THAT ON ANY LEVEL.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.885
- I'M NOT GOING INTO ANY DOUBT

20:19.968 --> 20:22.596
ABOUT [bleep]
THIS TATTOO UP, DAVE.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.222
- GOOD LUCK.

20:24.306 --> 20:24.848
{\an8}- I'LL SIT THERE AND TRY TO ACT
LIKE I'M NOT WORRIED

20:24.932 --> 20:26.058
{\an8}OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

20:26.141 --> 20:27.601
{\an8}BUT I DON'T LIKE
DOING PORTRAITS.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.145
I KNOW I HAVEN'T DONE ONE
WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.148
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVEN DONE
ONE WITHIN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.025
- I LIKE THAT SPOT.
I LIKE IT BETTER THAN HERE.

20:35.108 --> 20:39.154
{\an8}MY CANVAS WANTS IT
ON HIS FOREARM,

20:39.237 --> 20:39.947
{\an8}WHICH IS COVERED IN HAIR.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.032
IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.951
WHEN YOU HAVE HAIR
OVER A PORTRAIT,

20:44.034 --> 20:45.243
IT KIND OF MAKES IT LOOK
OLDER RIGHT AWAY,

20:45.327 --> 20:46.495
ONCE THAT HAIR GROWS BACK.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.579
SO, IF YOU LOOK
AT THE INSIDE OF YOUR ARM HERE--

20:47.663 --> 20:49.164
I MEAN, THERE'S
ALMOST NO HAIR THERE.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.999
SO I FEEL LIKE
THAT WOULD BE

20:51.083 --> 20:52.834
A REALLY, REALLY
GREAT SPOT FOR IT.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.753
- THERE ARE A LOT OF MOLES
BACK HERE.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.005
- I KNOW. MY QUESTION IS,
IF IT'S NOT THE BACK,

20:57.089 --> 20:58.507
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

20:58.590 --> 20:59.925
- YOU GOT THINGS
ON YOUR LEGS AT ALL?

21:00.008 --> 21:00.801
- NO.
- I'D PROBABLY SUGGEST

21:00.884 --> 21:02.177
LEGS, I GUESS.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.054
MY CANVASS WANTS A TATTOO
ON HER BACK.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.098
{\an8}BUT IT IS MOLE-Y BACK THERE.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.224
I NEED TO TATTOO HER
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.643
- WHO WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE--JIME?

21:09.726 --> 21:11.895
- YES.
- I GUESS HE SCREWED YOU, HUH?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.355
- IF SHE'S GONNA STICK
TO HER GUNS,

21:13.438 --> 21:15.190
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.858
MAYBE I'LL END UP
WITH A PORTRAIT OF HER MOTHER

21:16.942 --> 21:18.944
ON MY LEG.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.621
- YOU THINK IT WAS STUPID FOR ME
TO TAKE THIS ONE?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.039
- IT'S A TOUGH ONE.

21:31.123 --> 21:31.999
IT'S GOT A LOT
OF CONTRAST.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.751
- YEAH.
- I WOULD GO IN AND ADD

21:34.835 --> 21:36.044
A LITTLE BIT OF WHITE
HIGHLIGHTS TO THE HAIR.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.714
LIKE, YOU CAN BARELY SEE
THE [bleep] DETAILS IN THERE.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.716
- JUST 'CAUSE HAIR IS BLACK
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S JET BLACK.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.050
JIME DOESN'T DO PORTRAITS,

21:42.134 --> 21:43.301
SO HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.262
I'M JUST SAYING
LIGHTEN IT UP,

21:45.345 --> 21:46.221
JUST SO YOU CAN PUT
LITTLE WHITE HIGHLIGHTS.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.472
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- MM-HMM.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.933
THIS IS MORE
OF HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.769
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA ACCEPT
JOEY'S OPINIONS ON THIS ONE,

21:52.853 --> 21:55.647
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
I'M WORRIED AS [bleep].

21:55.731 --> 22:00.152
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO AN ACCURATE PORTRAIT.

22:00.235 --> 22:00.902
IF IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THE PHOTO,

22:00.986 --> 22:03.321
YOU'LL BE PACKING.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.532
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.325
- LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT.
- COME ON, BROTHER.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.785
- ALL RIGHT,
COME OVER HERE FOR ME.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.996
- OUR BIG KEYWORD THIS WEEK
IS "ACCURACY."

22:11.079 --> 22:12.873
{\an8}AND THAT FALLS IN PERFECTLY
WITH A PORTRAIT,

22:12.956 --> 22:15.500
{\an8}'CAUSE WE'RE COPYING
THE EXACT LIKENESS OF SOMEONE.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.170
SO ANY INACCURACIES
ARE GONNA ACTUALLY CHANGE

22:18.253 --> 22:20.172
WHO THAT PERSON IS.
- I LIKE IT.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.590
- IF YOU'RE GONNA WIN THIS
COMPETITION AND BE INK MASTER,

22:21.673 --> 22:25.010
YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BE ABLE
TO PASS THIS CHALLENGE.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.011
- YEAH, THIS IS GOOD,
RIGHT, MA?

22:26.094 --> 22:27.262
- YEAH. LIKE THAT--YEAH.
- YOU SEE IT?

22:27.346 --> 22:31.141
{\an8}- TO NOT SOUND TOO MUCH
LIKE A BIG TATTOO NERD,

22:31.224 --> 22:33.727
{\an8}MY FAVORITE THING
ABOUT THIS PHOTO

22:33.810 --> 22:35.270
{\an8}IS ALL THESE DETAILS
IN THE WRINKLES

22:35.353 --> 22:37.689
{\an8}AND THE TEETH
AND THE WHITE HIGHLIGHTS.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.691
PERFECT.
THIS IS GONNA BE PERFECT.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.652
THE DETAIL AND RESOLUTION
ON THIS PICTURE IS SO GOOD

22:42.736 --> 22:44.112
THAT I KNOW
I CAN KNOCK THIS OUT.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.947
- NO TURNING BACK.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.657
- I TOLD JOSHUA
THAT I WAS BETTER THAN HIM.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.785
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO REALLY PROVE IT.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.787
- ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?
- MM-HMM.

22:51.870 --> 22:55.582
[needle buzzing]

22:58.543 --> 23:01.671
- I'M DEFINITELY AIMING
AT BEATING TATU BABY TODAY.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.091
{\an8}SHE'S TOLD ME THAT SHE
CAN TATTOO WHATEVER I TATTOO,

23:04.174 --> 23:05.092
{\an8}BUT BETTER--
I WANT TO PROVE HER WRONG.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.844
- YOU CAN GO NEXT.
- NO.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.304
I ALWAYS HAVE FEAR
OF NEEDLES.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.640
- EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES.
- YEAH.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.766
- [laughs]

23:12.849 --> 23:14.768
- AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THE AREAS
FOR THIS TATTOO,

23:14.851 --> 23:15.852
WE DECIDED THE ONLY SPOT
THAT'S GONNA WORK NICE

23:15.936 --> 23:17.604
IS ON HIS BICEP.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.565
HAVING A FACE, LIKE,
RIGHT HERE I THINK IS PERFECT.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.192
{\an8}- JOSHUA'S HAS THIS REALLY LONG,
FLOWING HAIR,

23:22.275 --> 23:24.236
{\an8}AND HE ENDED UP
GIVING HER A BOB CUT.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.654
DOESN'T SHOW ACCURACY.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.989
ONCE AGAIN, HE'S JUST
HALF-ASSING ANOTHER TATTOO.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.075
JOSH JUST NEEDS TO PACK
HIS BAGS AND GO HOME.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.580
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY WANT TO WIN
THIS CHALLENGE.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.374
I'VE WON MANY AWARDS
DOING PORTRAITS.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.751
- I HOPE THE JUDGES
DON'T CRITIQUE IT TOO BADLY.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.795
- WE'LL THINK IT'S COOL,
BUT THEN THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,

23:41.878 --> 23:43.713
"NAH, IT'S [bleep] BAD."
- [chuckles]

23:43.797 --> 23:45.882
- I TATTOO DARKER
ON MY PORTRAITS,

23:45.966 --> 23:46.967
BECAUSE I WANT IT
TO LOOK GOOD IN TEN YEARS.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.302
I'M HERE TO WIN.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.887
I'M NOT HERE TO TAKE
A SECOND SEAT TO ANYBODY.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.889
- FOUR HOURS LEFT, ARTISTS.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.690
- WOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.024
- I LOVE IT.
- OH, MY GOD.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.151
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.820
- I WISH I LOOKED LIKE THAT.
[both laugh]

24:06.903 --> 24:08.947
- I NEED TO PROVE
THAT I CAN DO OTHER THINGS.

24:09.030 --> 24:09.906
IT'S GONNA BE A BIG FEAT
IN ITSELF TODAY

24:09.990 --> 24:11.658
IF I CAN MAKE IT PAST
THIS POINT

24:11.741 --> 24:13.451
AS ONE OF
THE NEW-SCHOOL KIDS.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.911
- SO DO YOU DO MUCH, LIKE,
REALISM PORTRAITS?

24:14.995 --> 24:19.416
- I WOULD SAY ALMOST
ABSOLUTELY NOT AT ALL.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.876
- OH, LOOK AT DAVE.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.461
- SO WHAT'D YOU DO--
LIKE, BLACK TEARS OR SOMETHING?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.588
- YEAH.

24:24.671 --> 24:25.714
- JIME SHOULD HAVE WENT
VERY SIMPLE AND BOLD,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.716
BUT I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO FLOURISH IT UP

24:27.799 --> 24:30.969
AND DETAIL IT OUT
AND GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE WOW.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.638
AND I THINK
THAT WAS THE WRONG DECISION.

24:35.015 --> 24:38.393
{\an8}- SOMEHOW, I WIPED
HIS ENTIRE RIGHT EYE

24:38.476 --> 24:39.978
{\an8}OFF OF MY STENCIL.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.813
MY PATTERN IS GOING AWAY,

24:41.897 --> 24:44.357
ESPECIALLY ON THE AREAS WHERE
I DON'T NEED IT TO GO AWAY.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.984
IF YOU LOSE
PART OF YOUR STENCIL,

24:46.067 --> 24:49.112
99.999% OF THE TIME,
YOU'RE [bleep].

24:49.196 --> 24:52.574
YOU DO NOT WANT TO TRY
TO FREEHAND SOMETHING ON A FACE.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.575
- JUST DID ONE EYE.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.328
- AS IF IT WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH,

24:56.411 --> 24:59.080
THIS GUY'S SITTING THERE
WATCHING ME [bleep] UP.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.999
I NEED TO FIX THIS.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.585
- YOU'RE NOT, LIKE,
OVER HIS SHOULDER WATCHING?

25:03.668 --> 25:07.047
- ONE MORE HOUR TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.968
[needle buzzing]

25:12.052 --> 25:14.679
- WE DECIDE WE'RE GONNA
TATTOO IT ON HER CALF.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.515
{\an8}SHE'S NOT A BIG GIRL,
AND IT'S A LOT OF DETAIL

25:17.599 --> 25:18.975
{\an8}IN A SMALL SPOT.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.435
EVERY WRINKLE,
EVERY STRAND OF HAIR,

25:20.519 --> 25:21.895
EVERY EYELASH IS GOING
INTO THIS TATTOO.

25:21.978 --> 25:25.440
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE WORK
THAT GOES INTO THIS.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.776
- I HAVE TO AT LEAST TRY
TO TAKE THIS HOME FOR MY FAMILY.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.487
I CAN'T KEEP BEING
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.322
- MAKE SURE YOU TELL HIM
IF HE'S DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.866
- KYLE'S LOOKS LIKE
A BALL OF RAISINS

25:34.950 --> 25:35.742
KIND OF, LIKE,
SMASHED TOGETHER.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.577
IS THAT HORRIBLE
FOR ME TO SAY?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.120
HE SHOULD BE TRYING
TO SOFTEN HER FACE

25:39.204 --> 25:41.373
AND JUST SHOW THE MAIN SHAPES
OF HER FACE

25:41.456 --> 25:44.292
RATHER THAN EVERY,
SINGLE [bleep] WRINKLE.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.835
- 15 MINUTES!

25:45.919 --> 25:50.257
- I WAS ABLE TO RE-STICK
THE DESIGN BACK INTO PLACE,

25:50.340 --> 25:51.716
BUT I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.801
ALMOST DONE.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.970
THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL
IN THIS THING.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.054
I'M SCREWED.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.014
- TEN, NINE,

25:58.098 --> 26:00.225
EIGHT, SEVEN,

26:00.308 --> 26:02.310
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

26:02.394 --> 26:05.397
THREE, TWO, ONE...

26:05.480 --> 26:07.065
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP. MACHINES DOWN.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.484
NO MORE INK.

26:09.567 --> 26:10.485
- HOW YOU FEELING--GOOD?

26:10.568 --> 26:11.903
- I FEEL GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.905
WE'LL SEE HOW YOU FEEL
AFTER YOU LOOK AT IT.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.324
- OH, KYLE, I LOVE IT.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.494
[crying]
OH, MA.

26:19.577 --> 26:21.162
I LOVE YOU.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.539
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.874
- OH, IT'S PERFECT.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.209
- I LOVE IT.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.168
- JIME DIDN'T FOLLOW
THAT PHOTOGRAPH

26:27.252 --> 26:29.212
EXACTLY HOW IT IS.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.006
HE DROPPED THE BALL ON IT.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.175
IT'S DEFINITELY NICE TO SEE
A WEAKNESS IN JIME.

26:35.885 --> 26:36.886
{\an8}- JUST NO RESPECT.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.513
{\an8}- NOT THAT I REALLY CARE
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.515
{\an8}- I KNOW, YOU'RE
JUST THE PERSECUTED ONE

26:40.598 --> 26:41.516
{\an8}IN THIS HOUSE.

26:41.599 --> 26:42.851
- THIS THING
IS HARSHLY UNAPPEALING.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.477
- YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK
WITH YOUR GUT.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.855
- THAT'S YOUR MISTAKE.
- WE DON'T NEED A DELIBERATION.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.861
- I'M NOT ONE
TO TALK [bleep], BUT...

26:52.944 --> 26:55.572
WHEN I SAID THAT I CAN DO
BETTER THAN YOU CAN,

26:55.655 --> 26:57.782
IT WAS BECAUSE
I DO TRULY BELIEVE

26:57.866 --> 26:59.701
THAT I'M A LOT MORE
ARTISTIC.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.744
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
I DO IT BETTER.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.829
I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
BETTER THAN YOU.

27:02.912 --> 27:03.955
THAT'S JUST A [bleep] FACT.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.040
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] THING IS,

27:05.123 --> 27:06.708
IS I CAME IN HERE
A FAN OF YOURS.

27:06.791 --> 27:10.378
I'M JUST SHOCKED THAT YOU WOULD
BE A TOTAL [bleep] CRAZY BITCH.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.713
- I FEEL LIKE JOSHUA

27:11.796 --> 27:14.049
JUST CROSSED THE LINE
OF DISRESPECT.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.426
- I'M SORRY THAT I HAVE OFFENDED
YOU TO THAT POINT.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.678
I WISH THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE
MY OPINION SO PERSONALLY.

27:18.762 --> 27:22.015
- YOU CALLED HER
A BITCH, THOUGH, YOU KNOW.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.309
{\an8}- I'M TIRED OF HIM TAKING
THE VICTIM CARD

27:24.392 --> 27:25.393
{\an8}WHEN HE SITS THERE
AND BERATES SOMEBODY,

27:25.477 --> 27:26.728
{\an8}AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE'S LIKE,

27:26.811 --> 27:28.980
{\an8}"I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT."

27:29.064 --> 27:30.899
- FROM A PERSON THAT CAN SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

27:30.982 --> 27:32.233
THERE'S NO RESPECT,
THERE'S NO APOLOGY,

27:32.317 --> 27:35.236
THERE'S NOTHING--
YOU JUST REALLY DON'T EXIST.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.822
- I'M SORRY THAT YOU
FEEL THAT WAY.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.574
THAT REALLY BUMS ME OUT...

27:39.657 --> 27:41.701
NOT THAT I REALLY CARE
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.578
- OH, THERE IT GOES.
- I REALLY DON'T.

27:43.661 --> 27:44.829
- YOU'RE JUST HILARIOUS.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.082
- I JUST DON'T EVEN
GIVE A [bleep].

28:05.016 --> 28:06.768
- TODAY YOU HAD
TO TATTOO A SUBJECT

28:06.851 --> 28:09.062
INTIMIDATING FOR EVEN
THE BEST TATTOO ARTISTS--

28:09.145 --> 28:11.773
A PORTRAIT.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.067
JASON, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.155
WAS IT NERVE-RACKING
TO HAVE THE SUBJECT

28:19.239 --> 28:20.949
OF YOUR PORTRAIT SITTING
IN THE ROOM WITH YOU

28:21.032 --> 28:22.325
AS YOU WERE TATTOOING HIM?
- IT'S A LITTLE FRIGHTENING...

28:22.409 --> 28:23.284
'CAUSE THEY'RE STANDING
RIGHT THERE.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.953
- YEAH.
- THIS IS TESTING EVERY ONE

28:25.036 --> 28:26.287
OF MY PANIC-DISORDER BUTTONS.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.622
- OVERALL, MAN, YOU DID DO
SOME NEAT TRICKS

28:27.705 --> 28:29.082
TO GET SOME DETAIL IN THERE.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.543
THE MUSTACHE AND THE BEARD--
THE DETAIL IS VERY NICE.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.837
THE MOUTH--YOU CAPTURED
THE LITTLE SMIRK.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.630
THERE'S A COUPLE SPOTS
YOU LOST ME ON ACCURACY.

28:35.713 --> 28:38.174
JUST THE SHAPE OF HIS HAIR, THE
WAY IT GOES ONTO HIS SHOULDER,

28:38.258 --> 28:39.926
IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME SHAPE.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.302
BUT ACCURACY
IN THE GLASSES--

28:41.386 --> 28:42.679
THAT'S THE BIG FUDGE
ON THIS THING.

28:42.762 --> 28:45.140
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KEPT TRYING
TO SCULPT IT AND SCULPT IT,

28:45.223 --> 28:48.351
AND YOU'VE ENDED UP CHANGING
THE SHAPE OF THE GLASSES.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.644
- I HAD TO PUT WHITE IN THERE,
AND THEN I NOTICED

28:49.727 --> 28:51.062
THAT IT WAS THICKENING UP.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.814
- THIS WAS THE TATTOO
THAT NEEDED THE MOST ACCURACY,

28:52.897 --> 28:54.983
BECAUSE THERE WERE
SO MANY DIFFERENT TEXTURES.

28:55.066 --> 28:59.487
IF YOU CAN'T NAIL EACH TEXTURE,
THEN IT SHOWS UP A LOT.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.947
IT JUST THREW IT OFF.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.242
- [bleep] ME.

29:04.325 --> 29:07.245
- JOEY.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.705
- IN TERMS OF ACCURACY,

29:08.788 --> 29:12.000
HE LOOKS ANGRIER
IN THE TATTOO

29:12.083 --> 29:13.585
THAN HE DOES IN THE PICTURE.

29:13.668 --> 29:14.878
- HE DOES LOOK
A LITTLE MORE AGGRO

29:14.961 --> 29:16.379
JUST FROM THE SHADING
ON THE BROW LINES.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.173
BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THAT DOWN

29:18.256 --> 29:19.549
AND YOU SEE THE LIGHT
THAT'S HERE

29:19.632 --> 29:20.675
AND YOU SEE THE SHAPE
AROUND THE EYE SOCKET,

29:20.758 --> 29:21.968
HOW DARK THAT IS,

29:22.051 --> 29:24.262
THAT'S ONE OF THE DARKER PARTS
ON THE PORTRAIT.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.306
ON YOUR TATTOO,
THAT WHOLE SHADE

29:26.389 --> 29:28.683
COMES DOWN THE FACE,
AND THE SHADING ON THE CHEEK

29:28.766 --> 29:30.560
IS JUST A LITTLE BIT
DARKER THAN THE PHOTO.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.021
- BUT I THINK THAT
IT WILL HEAL DIFFERENTLY,

29:33.104 --> 29:34.772
AND IT'LL BE LIGHTER.
- YEAH, BUT EITHER WAY...

29:34.856 --> 29:36.774
THE DARKNESS THAT YOU
HAVE IN THE CHEEK

29:36.858 --> 29:38.943
IS ALMOST AS DARK
AS WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE EYE,

29:39.027 --> 29:40.570
AND THAT'S GONNA
ALL HEAL THE SAME.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.822
DOING THAT HEAVY SHADING,
IT PRONOUNCES SOMETHING ON HIM

29:42.906 --> 29:44.199
THAT HE REALLY
DOESN'T HAVE PRONOUNCED.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.867
THE DARKNESS
GOT AWAY FROM YOU,

29:45.950 --> 29:50.371
AND IT'S MAKING HIM LOOK
MAJORLY DIFFERENT.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.373
- KYLE.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.501
- [bleep].

29:54.584 --> 29:56.836
- YOU ACCURATELY CAPTURED
A LOT OF PARTS ABOUT THIS LADY.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.546
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHADING
ON HER NOSE,

29:58.630 --> 29:59.839
IT ACTUALLY HAS DIMENSION.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.467
YOU ACTUALLY PUT
THE CONTOUR IN THERE.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.386
BUT THEN YOU WENT IN HERE
AND PUT TOO MUCH TIME

30:05.470 --> 30:06.429
INTO EVERY WRINKLE.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.972
YOU ACCENTUATED THE PARTS
OF THE PHOTO

30:08.056 --> 30:10.517
THAT YOU KIND OF DON'T WANT
TO ACCENTUATE.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.893
I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS
THE FIRST ONE TO SAY IT,

30:11.976 --> 30:13.561
BUT I DEFINITELY WASN'T THE ONLY
ONE TO SAY "LEATHER FACE"

30:13.645 --> 30:15.647
WHEN I LOOKED
AT THIS TATTOO.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.774
IT'S NOT A FLATTERING LOOK.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.235
- I FELT LIKE I KIND OF HAD
TO PUT THAT IN THERE.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.736
I HAD TO SHOW ACCURACY.

30:21.819 --> 30:23.238
- I THINK YOUR ACCURACY IS ONE
OF THE STRONGER POINTS ON IT.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.658
YOU NAILED IT, DUDE.
IT'S A LOT MORE ACCURATE--

30:26.741 --> 30:28.910
NOT TO PINPOINT JASON--
THAN HIS GLASSES.

30:28.993 --> 30:29.827
YOU HAD A TOUGH ONE,
BUT I THINK YOU DID

30:29.911 --> 30:30.912
A GREAT JOB ON IT,
PERSONALLY.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.084
- JIME.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.170
- YOUR WEAK POINT IS YOU
DIDN'T GO DARK ENOUGH

30:39.254 --> 30:40.922
IN THE HAIR, IN THE EYES.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.006
THE BEARD GOES
TO THE JAWLINE.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.009
YOU KIND OF CREATED
SOME HIGHLIGHTS IN THERE

30:45.093 --> 30:46.469
THAT MADE IT LOOK LIGHTER.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.347
- ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS
WAS TO MAKE THE TATTOO SO DARK

30:49.430 --> 30:50.390
THAT IT LOOKED LIKE
A COVER-UP.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.933
- I MEAN, WE SEE DAVE
ALL THE TIME,

30:52.016 --> 30:52.976
AND HIS HAIR IS JET BLACK.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.936
HIS EYES ARE SUPER DARK
AND SMOKY,

30:55.019 --> 30:57.814
AND YOU TOOK SOME LIBERTIES
WITH YOUR ACCURACY.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.400
IT KIND OF TAKES AWAY FROM
WHAT IT COULD HAVE REALLY BEEN.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.485
- THAT'S WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT,
BECAUSE I WAS LIKE--

31:02.569 --> 31:03.903
- RIGHT.
- SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED IT.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.280
YOU ENDED UP DOING
WAY MORE WORK THAN YOU HAD TO.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.073
- PORTRAITS--THE ACCURACY
OF THE SHADING

31:07.156 --> 31:09.075
AND THE DETAIL OF THE DARKS
AND LIGHTS IS EVERYTHING.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.744
BY NO MEANS IS THIS
IN THE TOP OF THE RUNNING TODAY.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.541
- TATU BABY.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.044
HOW DID YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

31:20.128 --> 31:21.838
THAT THE CHALLENGE
WAS PORTRAITS?

31:21.921 --> 31:22.964
- PORTRAITS IS SOMETHING
THAT I DO A LOT AT HOME.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.842
I'VE HAD CHANCES
WHERE I'VE SHOWN STUFF

31:25.925 --> 31:28.386
THAT I LIKE TO DO,
AND I HAVEN'T, LIKE, NAILED IT,

31:28.469 --> 31:30.680
SO I REALLY WANTED
TO REDEEM MYSELF.

31:30.763 --> 31:32.348
- AS FAR AS ACCURACY
ON THE TATTOO,

31:32.432 --> 31:33.891
YEAH, IT TOTALLY
LOOKS LIKE THE GUY.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.561
THE ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE
IS THE RIGHT EYE,

31:36.644 --> 31:38.563
A LITTLE BIG DARKER
IN THE PHOTO.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.148
BUT YOU PUT
THAT HIGHLIGHT IN THERE,

31:40.231 --> 31:41.983
AND THAT'S
YOUR OWN ARTISTIC LICENSE

31:42.066 --> 31:43.818
THAT MAKES THE TATTOO
EVEN LOOK BETTER.

31:43.901 --> 31:44.986
JUST THOSE LITTLE THINGS
THAT YOU CAN DO AS A TATTOOIST

31:45.069 --> 31:46.654
TO ADD TO SOMETHING
THAT'S A PHOTO

31:46.738 --> 31:48.865
MAKES IT MORE DYNAMIC.

31:48.948 --> 31:49.991
- THERE ARE SOME VERY
IMPRESSIVE PARTS TO IT.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.493
THE HIGHLIGHT
YOU PUT AROUND HIS CHIN,

31:52.577 --> 31:53.828
YOU KIND OF EMPHASIZED THAT

31:53.911 --> 31:54.996
SO THAT YOU DON'T LOSE
THE SHAPE OF THE FACE.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.165
- IN THE COLLAR
OF THE SHIRT ITSELF,

31:57.248 --> 31:58.583
THE WHOLE REAL PHOTO
IS DARK,

31:58.666 --> 31:59.959
AND YOU PUT
THE LITTLE HIGHLIGHTS IN

32:00.043 --> 32:01.669
TO REALLY CAPTURE
THE ESSENCE.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.089
THE EXTRA ADDED TOUCHES
THAT YOU GAVE TO THIS TATTOO

32:05.173 --> 32:07.300
REALLY BROUGHT
YOUR TATTOO TO LIFE,

32:07.383 --> 32:09.969

PORTRAIT OF MY MOM RIGHT HERE.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.267

A VERY SHORT HAIRCUT

36:26.350 --> 36:29.270

WITH THE PICTURE.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.605
- YEAH.
- IT'S ABOUT ACCURACY.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.315
- IT'S ABOUT PLACEMENT.
I THINK WHERE HE PICKED

36:32.398 --> 36:33.691
TO PLACE THE TATTOO
REALLY HURT IT.

36:33.774 --> 36:37.278
- THE PLACEMENT
WAS 110% ON ME.

36:37.361 --> 36:40.072
- BUT YOU LOSE THE ACCURACY
ANY TIME THE ARM MOVES AT ALL.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.282

36:41.365 --> 36:44.035

THE MONEY.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.620

36:45.703 --> 36:47.288
AND I GOT A PORTRAIT
OF DAVE NAVARRO.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.291

LOOKS VERY LARGE,

36:50.374 --> 36:53.127
AND IN THE PORTRAIT,
IT SEEMS MUCH FLATTER.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.587

36:55.588 --> 36:58.215

THAT'S GOING ON THE BOTTOM.

OF MY MOM.

37:07.475 --> 37:11.145

- HE AGED HER WAY TOO MUCH.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.397

- I THINK HE CAPTURED ME.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.691

THAT PIECE MORE LIFE.

40:07.613 --> 40:08.656
WE CAN IGNORE WHAT EVERYBODY'S
DONE IN THE PAST.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.575
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.579
- THE JUDGES MADE
THE WRONG DECISION.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.497
[sighs]

40:16.580 --> 40:18.165
I KNOW I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

40:18.249 --> 40:19.667
TO BE INK MASTER
AND BE IN THIS GAME.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.418
I SHOULDN'T BE GOING HOME.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.258
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:27.341 --> 40:29.635
- WOW.
- WE'RE ON THE <i> INTREPID</i>

40:29.718 --> 40:32.805
TO COMMEMORATE A FEW
OF OUR NATION'S HEROES.

40:32.888 --> 40:36.016
- MY FRIEND JORDAN WAS KILLED
BY A SUICIDE BOMBER.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.310
- IT'S GONNA BE A PRETTY
EMOTIONAL DAY, I THINK.

40:38.394 --> 40:42.064
- I'VE TATTOOED
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE HERE.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.566
I'M GOING TO BE
IN THE FINAL THREE.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.568
- THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
THAT JOSH COULD END UP

40:45.651 --> 40:46.944
WINNING THIS THING.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.487
- THERE'S NOTHING
ABOUT THIS

40:48.571 --> 40:50.030
THAT LOOKS LIKE
AN ADULT DREW IT.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.490
- NOBODY ELSE DID LINE WORK
THIS [bleep].

40:51.574 --> 40:53.534
- THIS HAS GOT YOU
IN THE DOGHOUSE.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.411
- [exhales deeply]
