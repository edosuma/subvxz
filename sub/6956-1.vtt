You miss me? You doin' good?

You either take or you get taken.

Lenny? Frankie, l understand.
But Lenny? You can't be serious.

09:36.780 --> 09:39.749

lt takes more than muscle to run things.

09:39.692 --> 09:43.560
Now Lenny, he's got the brains.
That's somethin' special.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.867

12:37.973 --> 12:42.774
Sykes, my brother from another mother.
What the deezy, baby?

12:42.644 --> 12:45.010
Show me dat.
What's goin' down?

12:44.979 --> 12:48.938
Hey, baby, this is all gravy today.
Now snap your fin... Snap it.

12:48.849 --> 12:50.840
- You're not snappin' it...
- Oscar.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.427
Hey, don't sweat it.
A lot of white fish can't do it.

12:53.392 --> 12:55.826
- Would you just sit down, okay?
- Thank you.

12:55.791 --> 12:58.988
l've been goin' over my markers.
You're into me for five grand.

12:58.926 --> 13:02.259
- 5 G's, okay?
- 5 G's? Man, you trippin'? 5 G's.

13:02.190 --> 13:04.715
Oh, yeah?
See if this refreshes your memory.

13:06.124 --> 13:08.422
That's crazy, look at that.

13:08.396 --> 13:12.264
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget.

13:12.170 --> 13:16.197
This a perfect example of why
you're in management, and l'm not.

13:16.105 --> 13:17.094
You go, boy.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.963
l have to pay Don Lino protection,
so everything you owe me, you owe him.

13:20.872 --> 13:23.568
- How you figure that?
- Simple. The food chain.

13:23.527 --> 13:27.019
See, on top there's Don Lino.
There's me, and there's regular fish.

13:26.951 --> 13:28.509
- That's me.
- No.

13:29.222 --> 13:31.383
There's plankton, there's amoebas...

13:31.364 --> 13:33.457
- Then there's me?
- l'm gettin' there.

13:33.443 --> 13:37.903
There's coral, there's rocks, there's
whale pooh, and then there's you.

13:37.794 --> 13:39.421
That's messed up.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.055
So if Don Lino's squeezin' me,
he's squeezin' you.

13:42.017 --> 13:43.917
- What?
- Oscar.

13:43.905 --> 13:44.963
Sorry.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.586
- Easy, boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place.

13:47.552 --> 13:50.851
There is no happy place with him here.
[high-pitched] l'm serious.

13:50.783 --> 13:53.274
Okay, please.
Please, just gimme some time.

13:53.246 --> 13:57.808
That's all l'm asking.
l'm begging you, Sykes. Please. Please.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.938
All right.

14:01.915 --> 14:05.282
'Cause l like you,
l'm gonna give you 24 hours to pay up.

14:05.209 --> 14:07.404
All of it?
How am l supposed to do that?

14:07.384 --> 14:11.150
That's your problem. Bring my 5,000
clams to the track tomorrow, or else.

14:11.065 --> 14:13.795
- Or else what?
- The boys'll explain.

14:13.751 --> 14:15.742
[both laugh]

14:16.279 --> 14:18.839
- [sizzling]
- [Oscar] Unpleasant.

14:18.869 --> 14:22.100
[Angie] 5,000 clams?

14:22.037 --> 14:26.371
You borrowed 5,000 clams
from Mr. Sykes?

14:26.259 --> 14:30.195
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

14:30.099 --> 14:32.932
l don't know, Ang.

14:32.880 --> 14:37.908
lt's just hard, all right,
because l'm a little fish in a big pond.

14:37.775 --> 14:40.710
A really big pond.
The ocean.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.799
l'm a nobody.
l want some of that.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.826
- Mrs. Sanchez?
- What?

14:48.813 --> 14:51.839
It's ladies' night,
Oh, what a night...

14:51.788 --> 14:54.052
Ew. No. That.

14:54.539 --> 14:58.999
The top of the reef.
Where the somebodies live.

14:59.434 --> 15:04.497
l wanna be rich and famous like them,
but l'm stuck down here.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.796
Well, what's wrong with down here?

15:07.719 --> 15:10.051
l'll tell you what's wrong
with down here.

15:10.021 --> 15:14.185
Remember my dad?
He worked at the Wash his whole life.

15:14.949 --> 15:17.474
Ooh, child...

15:17.444 --> 15:20.538
[Oscar]
He was the number one tongue scrubber.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.859
Every year for 25 years.

15:26.209 --> 15:31.704
To me, working at the Wash
was the coolest job in the ocean.

15:32.031 --> 15:36.127
But then I learned something
I will never forget.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.430
Oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber!

15:38.397 --> 15:40.627
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

15:40.605 --> 15:44.735
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

15:46.331 --> 15:48.322
My dad was the greatest.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.716
But nobody loves a nobody.

15:53.017 --> 15:55.178
l want to be a somebody.

15:55.160 --> 16:00.826
Oscar , you don't have to live
at the top of the reef to be a somebody.

16:00.661 --> 16:02.094
[grunts]

16:02.774 --> 16:06.835
What's the difference? lf l don't pay
Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow,...

16:06.741 --> 16:08.675
l'm dead anyway, so...

16:11.218 --> 16:13.209
Wait here.

16:24.462 --> 16:25.986
What's this?

16:28.174 --> 16:30.938
- A pink pearl?
- Mm-hm.

16:30.893 --> 16:32.690
Where'd you get that?

16:32.685 --> 16:34.676
My grandmother gave it to me.

16:35.596 --> 16:40.499
She said it started
from a tiny grain of sand,

16:40.363 --> 16:45.699
but then, after a while,
it grew into something beautiful.

16:47.687 --> 16:49.621
Dreams can begin small too.

16:49.607 --> 16:53.008
- No. No, l couldn't...
- Take it.

16:52.935 --> 16:56.132
lt'll get you the money you need
for Mr. Sykes.

17:01.027 --> 17:04.656
What do you mean, you don't understand?
We've been over it 1 ,000 times.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.569
l don't want to have to say it again.

17:06.561 --> 17:09.929
You're really giving me agita.
l don't know how else to say this.

17:09.858 --> 17:13.224
You see something,
you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.

17:13.152 --> 17:16.019
That's what sharks do.
That's a fine tradition.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.961
What's the matter with you? Your
brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.

17:19.869 --> 17:21.531
- Thanks, Pop.
- He's beautiful.

17:21.532 --> 17:24.866
He does what he's supposed to do.
Wipe your face.

17:24.797 --> 17:28.824
But you... l'm hearin' things.

17:28.731 --> 17:32.827
You gotta understand, when you
look weak it makes me look weak.

17:32.730 --> 17:35.961
- l can't have that.
- l know, Pop, l'm sorry.

17:35.896 --> 17:38.956
Lenny. Lenny. Look at me.
Look at me.

17:38.936 --> 17:42.201
This handin' over the business,
it's for you, for both of yous,

17:42.136 --> 17:44.730
and you're acting
like you don't even want it.

17:45.270 --> 17:48.603
l need to know that
you can handle that.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.865
[sighs]

17:51.316 --> 17:52.340
[splutters]

17:52.372 --> 17:56.240
All right. Right here,
in front of me now, eat this.

17:56.147 --> 17:59.776
- [whimpers]
- Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.

17:59.698 --> 18:01.097
Here's the thing.

18:01.105 --> 18:05.542
l'm on a diet. l read an article about
these shrimps. They're not good for ya.

18:05.423 --> 18:09.416
You know how many calories
are in one of those shrimps?

18:09.327 --> 18:10.316
A lot.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.716
lt's true.
lt's true and the other thing is,

18:12.686 --> 18:16.918
my sister had a baby and l took it over
because she passed away

18:16.812 --> 18:19.838
and then the baby lost its legs
and its arms

18:19.787 --> 18:23.518
and now it's nothing but a stump
but l still take care of it with my wife

18:23.434 --> 18:27.871
and it's growing and it's fairly happy,

18:27.753 --> 18:31.587
but it's difficult 'cause l've been
working a second shift at the factory

18:31.495 --> 18:33.486
to put food on the table,

18:33.479 --> 18:38.542
but all the love l see in that little
guy's face makes it worth it in the end.

18:40.325 --> 18:42.418
True story.

18:42.404 --> 18:46.067
- [sobs]
- [sighs]

18:45.987 --> 18:49.115
l'm not askin' you anymore.
l'm tellin' you. Eat it!

18:49.059 --> 18:51.289
- No. Have mercy.
- Pop, please...

18:51.266 --> 18:52.528
- Eat!
- No eat.

18:52.545 --> 18:54.911
Son, eat the shrimp!

18:54.880 --> 18:56.347
No, please.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.480
- Lenny! Eat, eat, eat!
- Don't! Pop!

18:59.423 --> 19:01.857
Put the shrimp down!

19:03.869 --> 19:06.463
Go now. No one's looking.
Get out of here.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.694
- You're free, now go.
- Thank you.

19:08.668 --> 19:11.193
You're a good person.

19:15.258 --> 19:17.055
Come on, fellas.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.688
Pop, l can handle the reef.
lt's not a problem.

19:25.655 --> 19:28.522
No. We're gonna do this as a family.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.372
Frankie, l want you to take Lenny out,
show him the ropes.

19:31.317 --> 19:34.514
- Come on, Pop.
- You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.699
Whether you like it or not.

19:36.692 --> 19:37.526
[bell rings]

19:37.492 --> 19:38.982
[bell rings]

19:40.627 --> 19:41.787
[cheering]

19:41.810 --> 19:43.903
That kid better show up
or he's dead meat.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.448
Just say the word, boss.

19:45.457 --> 19:49.416
Carrying a big ol' envelope full of
money, gonna give it to Mr. Sykes.

19:49.328 --> 19:52.058
Hurry up. This is our chance,
we don't want to miss it.

19:52.014 --> 19:54.847
- You sure?
- My trainer friend tipped me off.

19:54.798 --> 19:57.596
The race is rigged. We can't lose.

19:57.550 --> 20:01.008
- What's the horse's name?
- Lucky Day.

20:00.941 --> 20:03.501
[speakers]...Lucky Day, at 200 to 1.

20:03.466 --> 20:06.492
- We're gonna be rich!
- Rich!

20:06.443 --> 20:09.708
Top of the reef, here l come.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.200
No, wait. What am l doing?

20:11.209 --> 20:14.235
Remember what Angie said.
Remember what Angie said.

20:14.184 --> 20:15.947
What did Angie say?

20:15.943 --> 20:18.002
Dreams can begin small.

20:17.991 --> 20:21.893
You just have to... bet it all.
Bet it all!

20:21.799 --> 20:25.030
[commentator] And Lucky Day wins.

20:24.965 --> 20:26.956
[rap music]

20:30.371 --> 20:32.965
Five thousand on Lucky Day to win.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.957
That's 200 to one.
That would pay a million clams.

20:35.904 --> 20:40.238
Well , l guess that makes me
Oscar the millionaire.

20:40.129 --> 20:40.529
[echoes] The millionaire.

20:40.511 --> 20:42.103
[echoes] The millionaire.

20:43.903 --> 20:45.894
Lucky Day. Lucky Day.

20:50.173 --> 20:52.767
She's dangerous, super bad

20:52.732 --> 20:54.723
Better watch out, she'll take the cash

20:54.715 --> 20:59.345
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger

20:59.226 --> 21:01.956
She's dangerous, super bad

21:01.913 --> 21:03.972
Better watch out, she'll take the cash

21:03.961 --> 21:05.223
She's a gold digger...

21:05.241 --> 21:07.232
Nice bet.

21:11.862 --> 21:13.193
[chuckles]

21:13.205 --> 21:16.106
- You got a name?
- [chuckles]

21:16.052 --> 21:18.782
- You wanna tell me what it is?
- [chuckles]

21:18.740 --> 21:21.174
Well, mine's Lola.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.945
C'mon, man! Get your game face on!

21:23.924 --> 21:25.255
[yelps]

21:26.258 --> 21:30.786
So,... [chuckles] Lola, my name's...

21:31.376 --> 21:34.072
My name is Oscar, sweetie.

21:34.032 --> 21:35.624
[gasps] Mrs. Sanchez.

21:35.632 --> 21:39.124
The hippity-hop smooth talk
don't work with me.

21:39.054 --> 21:41.045
My bad. Hey, so...

21:41.037 --> 21:43.733
Oscar. l was starting to think
you skipped out on me.

21:43.692 --> 21:47.628
Sykes! l see you're already on your way
to the concession stand.

21:47.531 --> 21:48.862
What are you doing?

21:48.875 --> 21:52.208
Mind bringing us back some drinks?
That would be great, thanks.

21:52.137 --> 21:54.332
And some of them
little wiener thingies.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.339
- The ones with the toothpicks?
- Don't listen to him.

21:57.288 --> 22:00.780
- Let me escort you to... my box.
- Your box?!

22:00.711 --> 22:03.612
His box?! You can't even afford
the gum under the seats.

22:03.558 --> 22:08.996
He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.
l think he can afford anything he wants.

22:09.508 --> 22:13.410
- Five grand? My five grand?!
- No, it was another five grand.

22:13.315 --> 22:15.977
You had the money to pay me back
and you bet it anyway?

22:15.938 --> 22:17.872
- Hold up.
- Gimme that!

22:17.857 --> 22:20.690
- Clearly l've made a mistake.
- No, no, wait! Lola!

22:20.641 --> 22:24.042
Look. Deep down, l'm really superficial.

22:23.968 --> 22:29.099
And don't get me wrong, you're cute,
but... you're a nobody.

22:29.790 --> 22:33.590
Oscar, you cute, but you're a nobody.

22:33.502 --> 22:35.493
[Ernie] Wait. Lola. Come back.

22:35.485 --> 22:38.716
l'm not a nobody. l'm a wiener.

22:38.651 --> 22:40.219
[Ernie and Bernie laugh]

22:40.155 --> 22:43.090
You are unbelievable.
You're in trouble up to your gills

22:43.033 --> 22:45.900
and still you're askin' for more.
Now go on, get in here.

22:45.913 --> 22:49.110
Oscar, you better pray
that this horse of yours comes through.

22:49.048 --> 22:51.039
Bettin' my five thousand.

22:51.032 --> 22:53.432
Hey. Outta my seat.
You, outta my seat.

22:53.398 --> 22:54.922
Unbelievable.

22:54.934 --> 22:59.064
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye.

22:58.966 --> 23:00.331
[Ernie] Good eye.

23:00.341 --> 23:03.572
[announcer] The horses are
at the post. And they're off!

23:03.508 --> 23:06.068
Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit
and Salmonella.

23:06.035 --> 23:09.095
Lucky Day seems to be having trouble
getting out of the gate.

23:09.043 --> 23:11.511
- What?
- Only a sucker would bet on that horse.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.499
Don't sweat it.
He does this all the time. He's playin'.

23:14.448 --> 23:18.248
What's this? Lucky Day is now
crashing his way through the gate,

23:18.159 --> 23:19.820
and he's off and running.

23:19.823 --> 23:21.415
Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

23:21.422 --> 23:24.357
Please, Lucky Day.
Go fast.

23:24.877 --> 23:29.314
Coming around the turn it's Seabiscuit
by a length and Lucky Day well behind.

23:29.195 --> 23:30.856
And here comes Lucky Day,

23:30.860 --> 23:34.819
coming up from behind,
passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.

23:34.730 --> 23:36.857
You see? Who's your fish now? Go.

23:36.841 --> 23:39.366
Around the final turn,
here comes Lucky Day.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.634
Lucky Day's now caught up
to Fish Fingers.

23:41.608 --> 23:44.736
They're head to head. Neck to neck.
Lucky Day's ahead.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.843
l'm tired just thinkin'
about countin' all of this money.

23:47.782 --> 23:51.081
- Look at Lucky Day go.
-  We're movin' on up

23:51.013 --> 23:52.742
To the eastside...

23:52.740 --> 23:58.110

No.

49:00.220 --> 49:01.380
No way.

- Sharks are coming to get me!

50:18.244 --> 50:20.769
And they should.
l mean, what'd you expect?

50:20.739 --> 50:22.730
You'd take credit
for killing a shark,

50:22.724 --> 50:26.717
and then everything would be fine
and dandy for the rest of your life?

50:26.626 --> 50:29.561

50:56.089 --> 50:59.354
Then you gonna swim out and
meet the sharks before they get here.

50:59.288 --> 51:03.486
And you're gonna say, ''Stop.
Don't y'all. Don't go no farther!''

- [Oscar] Why did you do that?
- l'm sorry.

53:12.462 --> 53:16.159
No. ''Sorry'' is when you step on

53:16.078 --> 53:18.603
''Sorry'' is when you say,
''When's the baby due?''

Hey, Don. Lino. Sir. lt's not his fault.
This is between you and me.

01:09:01.321 --> 01:09:03.220
What did l ever do to you?

01:09:03.209 --> 01:09:07.407
You took Frankie away
and you turned Lenny into a dolphin.

01:09:07.303 --> 01:09:09.167
l'm gonna get you.

01:09:09.158 --> 01:09:13.493
- [Angie] Oscar, look out.
- Oscar, swim. Swim for your life.

01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:23.187
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer.

01:09:23.138 --> 01:09:25.197
Well, well, well.

01:09:25.185 --> 01:09:27.916
Look who's stuck in the porthole.

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.282
You still hungry, big guy?

01:09:30.272 --> 01:09:32.638
Well, say hello to my little friends.

01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:35.770

01:09:37.246 --> 01:09:38.611

01:09:46.139 --> 01:09:47.935
- Try it again.
- Whale Wash,

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.956
you get a whale of a wash
and the price...

01:09:49.947 --> 01:09:51.038
Oh, my gosh.

01:09:51.064 --> 01:09:53.932
All right. You got it right.

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:55.439
Everybody out of the way.

01:09:58.872 --> 01:10:01.636
- Blow out.
- Shark!

01:10:07.381 --> 01:10:10.145
Come on, Lino,
it's time to clean up your act.

01:10:14.034 --> 01:10:15.661
Pop, leave him alone.

01:10:23.087 --> 01:10:25.521
All right, Lino. Game's over.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.303
- Lenny? What are you doing in there?
- Sorry.

01:10:35.244 --> 01:10:37.235
Where's Lino?

01:10:37.227 --> 01:10:40.196
- He's right behind me, isn't he?
- You're mine now.

01:10:47.817 --> 01:10:49.478
Whoa!

01:10:52.199 --> 01:10:53.928
Let's finish this, Sharkslayer.

01:10:53.926 --> 01:10:55.917
Oh, we're about to.

01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:17.990
[whirring]

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:25.132
- [music on headphones]
- Thank you for coming to Whale Wash.

01:11:25.021 --> 01:11:26.682
[muttering]

01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:31.051
OK, somebody needs to
get me out of the bubble.

01:11:30.971 --> 01:11:33.030
- Today.
- [pop]

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:36.314
- Angie...
- The Sharkslayer does it again.

01:11:36.281 --> 01:11:40.308
This time, luring two sharks
into his death-trap of hygiene.

01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:42.980
Oscar, you're the somebody
everybody wants to be.

01:11:42.935 --> 01:11:46.701
The top of the food chain.
Tell our cameras how it feels to be you.

01:11:46.614 --> 01:11:48.775
- Angie.
- Oscar, get me outta here, quick.

01:11:48.757 --> 01:11:51.351
l need a head start
to get as far away as possible.

01:11:51.316 --> 01:11:54.080
- Look what you did to him.
- lt's a misunderstanding.

01:11:54.036 --> 01:11:55.901
Sharkslayer. Over here.

01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.382
[chant] Sharkslayer. Sharkslayer.

01:12:00.626 --> 01:12:02.491
Stop!

01:12:02.481 --> 01:12:07.111
l am not a real Sharkslayer!

01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:08.982
[everyone gasps]

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:17.055
- l lied.
- What?

01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:22.067
And l'm not
a real financial advisor. [sobs]

01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:25.697
OK. lt was an anchor
that killed Frankie.

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:28.738
l didn't have anything to do with it,
and neither did Lenny.

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:31.206
lf that was true,
why did you run away?

01:12:31.176 --> 01:12:35.044
Because you always wanted me
to be like Frankie.

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:37.886
l'll never be the shark
you want me to be.

01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:40.128
What is your problem?

01:12:40.102 --> 01:12:43.503
So your son likes kelp.
So his best friend is a fish.

01:12:43.429 --> 01:12:48.196
So he likes to dress like a dolphin.
So what?

01:12:48.067 --> 01:12:51.468
Everybody loves him
just the way he is.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.763
Why can't you?

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.741
Don't make the same mistake that l did.

01:12:58.688 --> 01:13:02.351
l didn't know what l had
until l lost it.

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:10.116
Will you get me outta this

01:13:10.108 --> 01:13:13.202
so l can hug my kid
and tell him l'm sorry?

01:13:13.947 --> 01:13:15.437
Pop.

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:19.096
[whirring]

01:13:20.473 --> 01:13:22.202
Come here, you.

01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:29.062
l love you, Son, no matter
what you eat, or how you dress.

01:13:28.919 --> 01:13:30.648
[Angie] Oscar?

01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:31.943
Angie?

01:13:38.099 --> 01:13:42.798
Angie, l wish l knew now
what l knew then.

01:13:42.675 --> 01:13:45.701
l mean, l wish you knew
what l knew,

01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:47.640
l mean, before this...

01:13:47.633 --> 01:13:50.227
- You're blowin' it, man.
- Mind your business.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.990
lt's emotional and it's pressure.

01:13:52.944 --> 01:13:55.640
What l'm saying, l just...

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.792
l didn't need the top of the reef.

01:13:57.775 --> 01:14:02.644
Everything l wanted was right there
in front of me the whole time.

01:14:02.507 --> 01:14:05.772
Well, what about being a somebody?

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:08.505
l'm nobody without you.

01:14:14.056 --> 01:14:16.047
[bells jingle]

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.099
[Joe makes smoochy noises]

01:14:18.088 --> 01:14:20.079
You're not helping.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.943
Come here,
you big dumb dummy-head.

01:14:29.284 --> 01:14:33.414
l never told you two this, but you're
the best henchman a guy ever had.

01:14:33.314 --> 01:14:35.111
C'mon, group hug.

01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:36.799
Sorry, man.

01:14:36.835 --> 01:14:39.429
Come, Sykes, try again, mon.
Don't fret.

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.224
Forget it. The moment's gone.

01:14:41.216 --> 01:14:44.617
So, uh, Lino... Uh, Don...

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.807

01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:50.743
Walk the streets, you know, without...

01:14:57.307 --> 01:15:00.367
You've lost everything
you lied so hard to achieve.

01:15:00.314 --> 01:15:02.782
Tell me, what's next for you?

01:15:04.762 --> 01:15:08.664
Come on, everyone's waiting,
Mr. Manager.

01:15:08.567 --> 01:15:11.900
