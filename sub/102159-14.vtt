09:53.244 --> 09:57.292
- If the "Gazette" folds,
Edge wins.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.077
- Sometimes,
there aren't winners.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.862
Just losers.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.428
Lois, if I don't
take this offer,

10:03.472 --> 10:06.257
I'll be underwater in a month.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.737
I don't have a choice.

10:14.439 --> 10:21.272
<i>♪</i>

10:22.012 --> 10:24.624
<i>-
It is done.</i>

10:24.667 --> 10:27.670
<i>A worthy sacrifice.</i>

10:27.714 --> 10:29.454
<i>- Let us begin.</i>

10:29.498 --> 10:31.631
<i>-
The time has come.</i>

10:31.674 --> 10:33.328
<i>Krypton will be reborn.</i>

10:39.551 --> 10:43.555
- Just doesn't seem right,
Smallville without Lana Lane.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.296
She's a part of this town.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.691
- Maybe she has a point though.
Maybe that Smallville is gone.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.302
I mean, Chrissy has worked at
the "Gazette" her entire life

10:51.346 --> 10:52.826
just to have it vanish.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.828
- And there's nothing
you can do?

10:54.871 --> 10:57.308
- Unless Superman starts
robbing banks, no.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.440
She needs a miracle.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.920
No more DOD! No more DOD!

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
- She's not the only one.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.751
No more DOD!
No more DOD! No more DOD!

11:04.794 --> 11:05.839
- Doesn't sound good.

11:05.882 --> 11:12.497
No more DOD! No more DOD!

11:12.541 --> 11:13.847
- This is bad.

11:17.111 --> 11:20.331
- Attention, everyone.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.724
- We have to do something.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.334
- Please calm down
and take your seats,

11:23.378 --> 11:25.032
and we can get started.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.340
- Hey, babe.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.603
So I'm gonna swing
by the station real quick

11:31.647 --> 11:35.346
and pack up my stuff.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.436
Should be home in time
to put the ribs on.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.526
- Do you think
that we're making a mistake?

11:41.570 --> 11:43.311
- What, eating baby backs?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.924
- Leaving Smallville?

11:47.968 --> 11:51.145
I mean, do you think
we're giving up too easily?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.800
- Is that what Clark said?

11:53.843 --> 11:56.193
- I just--
I don't want us to rush

11:56.237 --> 11:58.848
into a decision
that we're gonna regret later.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.417
- I don't think we have
much of a choice.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.768
Folks 'round here
kind of forced our hand.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.510
- Not everybody's
out to get us, Kyle.

12:08.553 --> 12:12.906
- All right, look,
I am very appreciative

12:12.949 --> 12:14.821
of everything that the Kents
have done for us.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.649
They've been solid, but Lana,

12:17.693 --> 12:20.435
their friendship ain't gonna
put food on the table.

12:20.478 --> 12:24.308
-
I know.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.832
It's just hard.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.271
- Yeah, I know.

12:31.794 --> 12:36.233
But hey, as long as I got you,

12:36.277 --> 12:38.540
doesn't matter where we live.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.934
Okay, so you and me, we--

12:40.977 --> 12:44.459
we can make any place home,
all right?

12:44.502 --> 12:47.157
- Yeah.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.857
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.902
- Welcome
to the new Smallville.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.425
It's the same as the old one.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.253
Just more pathetic.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.691
- Where you been hiding,
QB 2?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.781
- Oh!

13:01.824 --> 13:03.391
- Hey, just--
you know how it goes.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.001
Just catching up
on some school work.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.090
- Uh, our town's under siege,

13:07.134 --> 13:09.614
and you're hiding
at home to study?

13:09.658 --> 13:11.399
- Dude, wrong answer.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.835
- Time to get
off the bench, bro.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.184
Jimmy's parents
are out of town.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.838
He's got the whole place
to himself.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.449
- Wellnitz is picking up a keg
as we speak.

13:18.493 --> 13:22.453
Totally crafty.
ABVs are super high.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.108
- All right, I'm in.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.849
- You should come too,
Shortstack.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.678
- All right, we're gonna go
pick up Denise and Kaitlin.

13:29.721 --> 13:30.984
See you boys there, yeah?

13:31.027 --> 13:32.768
- Peace.
- See you later, man.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.032
- How much more
passive-aggressive

13:36.076 --> 13:37.555
could Sean get?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.383
- I don't know, I mean,
maybe it's just weird

13:39.427 --> 13:41.777
'cause you, like, dated?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.997
- It wasn't a problem before.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.563
Now that my parents
are all scarlet letter,

13:45.607 --> 13:47.348
it's like I'm Hester Prynne
by association.

13:47.391 --> 13:50.307
-
- We don't have to go.

13:50.351 --> 13:53.223
- No. It's been, like, forever
since you guys have hung out,

13:53.267 --> 13:55.747
and it'll be fun
brother bonding time.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.663
Plus the beer's,
like, so crafty.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.317
- You sure?
- Yeah.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.667
I had promised Soph
to do Princess Hair Salon,

14:02.711 --> 14:04.974
you know, 'cause of earlier.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.848
- Just call me
when you get home?

14:08.891 --> 14:10.762
- Yeah. All right.
- See you.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.982
- Wellnitz better keep
his shirt on this time.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.207
- You see what kind
of hornets' nest

14:20.250 --> 14:21.991
your little paper stirred up?

14:22.035 --> 14:23.993
- Then let me help.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.735
- I was hoping you'd say that.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.828
- All right, everyone.
Call to order.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.353
General Lane is here to answer
any concerns you may have

14:36.397 --> 14:39.530
about the continuing presence
of the DOD in Smallville.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.706
General Lane.
- Thank you, Mayor Dean.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.535
- When are your soldiers
gonna leave our town?

14:44.579 --> 14:47.016
Yeah!

14:48.931 --> 14:52.108
- I promise you the DOD is
working as fast as we can.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.719
Once all hazardous materials
have been removed

14:54.763 --> 14:56.460
from the mines, you can expect

14:56.504 --> 14:58.723
a precipitous drop
in troop numbers.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.029
- Those troops are scaring away

15:00.073 --> 15:01.857
the businesses here
on Main Street.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.381
I mean, why can't they all be
stationed over at the mines?

15:04.425 --> 15:06.296
- Yeah, and what's
in those mines

15:06.340 --> 15:08.777
that's so dangerous anyways?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.170
- I'm not at liberty to discuss

15:10.213 --> 15:11.911
the exact nature
of the substance, but--

15:11.954 --> 15:14.304
- Well, you'll take it from
under our noses no problem.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.958
- Look, everyone, I'm sure

15:16.002 --> 15:17.699
they have a good reason
for removing it.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.744
- Yeah, it's probably worth
a hell of a lot of money.

15:19.788 --> 15:23.183
- I can assure you
no one is profiting from this.

15:23.226 --> 15:26.012
We're merely acting
in the public's best interest.

15:26.055 --> 15:29.406
- General Lane, can you tell us
where Morgan Edge is right now?

15:29.450 --> 15:32.888
- I'm not able to comment
publicly on that at this time.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.021
- Why not?
People are afraid,

15:35.064 --> 15:36.631
and they wanna know
that they're safe.

15:36.674 --> 15:37.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

15:38.024 --> 15:39.590
- Ms. Beppo,
I think you've caused

15:39.634 --> 15:41.244
enough panic for one day.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.029
- Can you at least tell us
if Edge is in custody?

15:43.072 --> 15:45.553
- Ms. Beppo?
- No, he's not.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.077
- Lois.
- They deserve to know.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
Edge managed to escape

15:50.036 --> 15:51.428
a holding facility
a few weeks ago.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.214
Now, since then,
Superman and the DOD

15:54.257 --> 15:56.694
have been working diligently
to try to track him down.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.087
But as of right now,

15:58.131 --> 16:00.437
his whereabouts are
still unknown.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.744
- Should we be worried
that he's gonna come back here?

16:05.442 --> 16:07.749
- I'm afraid until Morgan Edge
is apprehended,

16:07.792 --> 16:09.403
there's reason for concern.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.580
But let me assure you, the DOD
is doing everything we can

16:12.623 --> 16:14.712
to keep the people
of Smallville safe.

16:14.756 --> 16:17.498
- Don't anyone trust a word
that man says.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.023
- Is that
Derek Powell's mother?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.285
- Yeah.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.766
- The DOD has been lying
for months.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.945
Ever since my son died.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.165
And I have proof.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.134
- Thought that might be you.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.662
- I figured now is as good
a time as any to clear out.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.229
- Especially since most
of the guys

16:53.273 --> 16:55.101
are at the town hall right now.

16:56.798 --> 17:00.236
I got a call from the chief
in Bristol asking about you.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.326
- Just putting
some feelers out is all.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.241
- Yeah?
'Cause the "for sale" sign

17:05.285 --> 17:07.635
in your front lawn
seems to suggest otherwise.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.506
- What do you want me to do,
Tamera?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.770
- It wasn't easy
when I signed up, Chief.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.816
All the looks from
the other guys thinking a woman

17:14.859 --> 17:17.906
had no place at the station,
never mind a Black woman.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.126
But you,
you always had my back.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.692
- 'Cause I knew they were
dead wrong about you.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.086
- And I was hoping we can
prove 'em wrong again.

17:24.130 --> 17:30.571

17:31.485 --> 17:33.356
I want you to know

he'd be lucky to have you.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.188
Good luck, boss.
I'm rooting for you.

- Shoot, shoot!

17:58.599 --> 17:59.861
- Oh, my God!

18:12.613 --> 18:14.571
- This is a letter from
the Department of Defense

18:14.615 --> 18:17.096
signed by that man right there,
and in it,

18:17.139 --> 18:20.360
he says that my son's death
is under investigation.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.580
- That's true, Mrs. Powell.
We're still in the process

18:23.624 --> 18:25.713
of gathering facts
about how Derek died.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.715
- He died because of what
Morgan Edge did.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.630
That is how he died!
You have known for months,

18:29.673 --> 18:31.762
and you didn't bother
saying anything to me.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.591
- Sharon, I know how difficult
this has been for you.

18:34.635 --> 18:38.856

18:40.815 --> 18:43.165
The guilt a mother feels

18:43.209 --> 18:45.254

over and over again

18:45.298 --> 18:47.126
what I could have
done differently.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.085

18:50.129 --> 18:54.176
- Please, tell me
what Morgan Edge did to my son.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.960
I need to know the truth.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.228
- My team just got
a hit on Edge.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.838
- What?

19:03.881 --> 19:05.927
- He just attacked the facility
where Larr's being held.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.276
We need to go.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.104
Sorry, folks,
but there's a situation

19:09.148 --> 19:10.192
that needs
our immediate attention.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.367

19:13.761 --> 19:16.111
- Running away?
- We want answers!

19:16.155 --> 19:18.635
- Tell us the truth!

19:22.030 --> 19:24.859
We want answers!
We want answers!

19:29.907 --> 19:31.648
- We have to get back in there.
- That's not an option.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.433
- Smallville is
tearing itself apart.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.825
If we don't do something--

19:34.869 --> 19:36.218
- Did you not hear me?

19:36.262 --> 19:37.654
Edge is out,
and he's got Larr with him.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.309
- Then we need to warn
the town.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.006
- He doesn't seem to be
anywhere near Smallville.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.660
- That's 'cause they got
a different target.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.968
My tracker picked them up
after they left the DOD.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.491
They're in Metropolis.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.972
- Just like on your Earth.
- You two need to go now.

19:51.015 --> 19:54.454
- Wait, on your Earth,
Superman didn't act alone.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.890
He had an entire army.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.239
Does Edge really think

19:57.283 --> 19:58.588
that he and Larr can take
an entire city?

19:58.632 --> 19:59.894
- After what we saw him do

19:59.937 --> 20:02.113
when he escaped the DOD,
maybe he can.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.811
- Or maybe he just
wants to hurt me.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.160
He saw my memories.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.727
He knows how much history
we have in Metropolis.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.381
- Yeah, but if he just
wanted to hurt you,

20:08.424 --> 20:10.470
why wouldn't he come
straight to Smallville?

20:10.513 --> 20:12.472
There is a bigger picture
we're not seeing.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.125
I should go with you.
Can you keep the boys safe?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.476
- I'll reach out, make sure
they get back to the farm.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.478
- Do you have a location
for Edge?

20:20.741 --> 20:23.396
- Looks like he's
still in Centennial Park.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.619
- Please do not move
the barriers.

if we do distance,

We were--I was just about

happening with Morgan Edge?

33:35.361 --> 33:36.927

33:36.971 --> 33:40.757

to drunk teenagers?

33:40.801 --> 33:41.932
- Grandpa, we're really sorry.

- I don't wanna hear it.
Let's go.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.502

take Sarah home?

33:46.546 --> 33:48.156
We've had a really long night.

the Eradicator?

34:13.094 --> 34:15.227

Kal-El.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.534

speaking earlier,

it sounded like--
- A whole bunch of voices.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.061
- Maybe that's why you never
found the Eradicator.

34:23.104 --> 34:27.804

made himself the Eradicator?

34:27.848 --> 34:29.110
I mean, is that even possible?

34:29.154 --> 34:30.416

his new powers.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.200
- And the four new subjects.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.767
- Okay, so let's say
Edge can make subjects.

Where would he go next?
- Isn't it obvious?

34:36.944 --> 34:38.728
To make more.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.733
- So how'd you find us?

You think I can't track down
my own grandsons?
