22:48.801 --> 22:52.044
To ensure that if anyone
has left us in the night,

22:52.137 --> 22:54.139
at least they will
not lie undiscovered.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.319
Although you,
dear lady, are nearer

22:56.375 --> 22:58.821

Is this the Marigold Hotel?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.837
Do you have a reservation?

23:22.935 --> 23:25.074
No, it seems great to me.
I meant...

23:25.204 --> 23:27.241
No, I know what you meant.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.579
And, no,
I don't have a booking.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.810

life a little better.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.562
I'm in room 6. You are? She is?

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:37.756
A let's been going on.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.299
I'm sorry,no.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:44.226
So, Mr. Chambers.

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:46.270
Could you hold on a sec,
Miss Beech?

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.568
The great Mr. Chambers.

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.600
The great writer Mr. Chambers.

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:55.647
Sure, if you like. I do not like, sir.
I do not like one bill.

01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:57.853
What did you wanna tell me?

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:00.819
To leave this hotel and never
darken its towels again.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:03.245
You lied, sir. He did not lie.

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:05.585
You pretended not to be
something you weren't.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:09.652
There was an inspector. It just wasn't him.
It was that one.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:13.259
Lavinia. Except that's
not your name, is it?

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.098
<font color="#D900D9">(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)</font>
No. My name's Theresa.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:20.171
I knew that I knew you. You
work for the competition.

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.297
"Golden Years," right? Correct.

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:24.172
How did you know that?

01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:26.007
It's his business to know.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:29.006
And ours to know
what he's up to.

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:31.179
Please explain.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:38.518
She is a hotel inspector. Just not the
one that they were worried about.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.290
That would be me.

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.532
I told you.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.872
The nose knew.

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:02.380
While there are patterns
we can study...

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:05.849
to mitigate the amplitude of
the extreme highs and lows...

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:09.649
that characterize any entrepreneurial
journey, they'll come anyway.

because the highs...

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:18.822
like being here today with you
all, make everything worthwhile.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:23.393
Just get in the game. I'll see
you in the bar. Thank you.

They were riveted.

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:30.772
Riveted, they were. No, really.

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:32.209
Thank you.

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:39.846
Laura's success
continues, evidently.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.888
Yes, I'm very proud of her.

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:44.891
It's a shame Douglas couldn't
be here to enjoy it.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:48.589
What exactly is your job here?

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.694
Sourcing fabrics
and liaising between

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.596
the merchants and
the company I work for.

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:55.565
Ooh, doesn't that
just trip off the tongue.

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:57.399
Oh, it's easier
to say than to do.

01:24:57.526 --> 01:24:59.938
Well, you look as if
you're handling it.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:04.274
I must say, I admire what
you've made of yourself here.

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:06.569
Thank you.

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:10.206
There's only one
thing puzzling me.

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:14.718
Douglas pleaded not guilty to adultery.
Why would that be'?

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.917
Do you not fancy him?

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.956
Even when I could
hardly stand the man,

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.890
I still found him
rather attractive.

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:23.225
In some ways rather
more so than Daniel.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.731
Well, Douglas has
one great advantage

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.563
over Daniel which is
that he actually exists.

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.968
Daniel exists.

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:37.566
He does. Oh, if you say so.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.611
I work in his office.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:44.276
I've started doing clerical
stuff, Tuesdays and Thursdays...

01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:46.818
just to keep the ends meeting.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:51.114
Money doesn't stretch as far
in Reigate <i>as</i> in Rajasthan.

01:25:53.949 --> 01:25:56.793
Daniel knows my name, of
course, we're a small team.

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.592
But he hasn't proposed,
I grant you that.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:03.168
That's why I want the divorce.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:07.637
I can hardly expect a man to want to
go outwith me while I'm still married.

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:15.381
What do you suppose we should
do for our first date?

01:26:16.138 --> 01:26:18.550
I'm too embarrassed
to ask Laura.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:22.383
A film? A shared experience.
Something to talk about afterwards.

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.690
Which will prevent
any possible awkwardness.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:27.452
Oh, there won't be
any awkwardness.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:29.894
No, I don't suppose
there will be.

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:36.129
There are some people into whose
laps the good things in life fall.

01:26:37.993 --> 01:26:39.904
I'm not one of them.

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:43.970
Coming out here
finally taught me that.

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:47.147
So, if the good things
won't come on their own,

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.840
I must make them.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.985

Why do you need a clipboard?

And I promise you three things.

I promise I will properly
rehearse the wedding dance.

I promise I'll wear the turban your
mother chose for the ceremony.

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.212
And I promise I'll be a
better husband than fiancé.

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:04.722
Good... because
you're a terrible fiance.

01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:09.489
Listen to me.

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:12.832
If there is ever a time
in our life together when...

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.831
I find myself
attracted to another man

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:18.735
or even confused a little,
I will always tell you.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:22.297
And that way, you know that
I will never, ever act on it.

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:24.908
I don't find Kush attractive.

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.838

close to his head.

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:34.583
I hoped you would find his
offer of a partnership...

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.085
more attractive.

01:28:39.915 --> 01:28:41.758
But that is up to you.

01:28:43.852 --> 01:28:46.355
Have you seen my other
shoe, darling? Hmm?

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:49.266
If you don't tell me what's been
the problem for the last few days,

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.769
I'll need it to kick you with.

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:52.930
Your shoe's under the bed.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:54.606
And you're having an affair.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:57.200
Oh, so it is. Wonderful.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.676
I said I know you're
sleeping with someone else.

01:28:59.768 --> 01:29:02.009
Of course I am, darling.
Aren't you?

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:05.516
What about that twitchy little
witch at the club? Susan.

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:08.884

it like rabbits for weeks now.

No. I mean no!

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:14.689
Well, why not?
What's been stopping you?

01:29:14.783 --> 01:29:16.285
Well, you have.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.186
What?

01:29:19.054 --> 01:29:20.624
That's not fair.

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:22.166

any of these men?

mean I was celibate.

room for improvement

in the running of this hotel...

01:31:30.752 --> 01:31:32.823
would be to
understate the surreally

to the reservoirs of affection

01:31:59.047 --> 01:32:04.053
that with a new and better-equipped
facility like the Supreme Quality“.

01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:07.709
You would have
had my endorsement.

01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:09.063
Would have?

01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:14.505
Well, I'm resigning. My position
is totally compromised here.

01:32:15.964 --> 01:32:17.204

01:32:17.332 --> 01:32:19.903
But you've got another
inspector right here.

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.207
I don't like the people
she works for

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:22.804
but if that's
the only game in town...

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.508
We've spoken already.

Her recommendation
is also based upon

the acquisition of
the Supreme Quality Hotel.

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.822
Why don't you just
do a deal with him?

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:36.992
If only for the sake
of your beautiful bride.

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:42.395
Right, well I'll be,

Could you... Would you
please tell your mother...

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:54.503
Would you please tell her
that I'm quitting my job?

Write my book.

Mr. Chambers.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.584
Allow me to offer you
a lift to the Viceroy Club.

01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:11.293
Vikram's beautiful
minibus awaits.

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:16.224

01:33:24.232 --> 01:33:25.302
Good.

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.765
Careful. You'll never
get back up again.

01:33:53.895 --> 01:33:57.240
Well, you're still in one
slightly sagging piece, I see.

01:33:57.332 --> 01:34:00.939
Barely. The plane was
diverted just before landing.

01:34:01.069 --> 01:34:05.575
