00:01.876 --> 00:02.919
{\an8}♪♪

00:03.002 --> 00:04.963
{\an8}(Garrett)
I grew up around Siesta Key,

00:05.046 --> 00:06.881
{\an8}and I always knew there was
a lot of money here.

00:06.965 --> 00:10.093
But until Kelsey started getting
invites to hang with Alex...

00:10.176 --> 00:12.053
{\an5}(Chloe)
Are you getting excited
for your birthday?

00:12.137 --> 00:13.179
Oh, yeah, you should come.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.014
...I never really saw it
up close.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.766
(whooping and cheering)

00:16.850 --> 00:20.270
Alex invited me-- and you--
to come on the boat Sunday.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.105
I'd be willing to go.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.105
{\an3}Willing?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.940
{\an5}(Garrett)
I wasn't comfortable
around that crew,

00:24.023 --> 00:25.442
but Kelsey felt different.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.110
I told you
I'd take you out.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.696
{\an5}Now you're driving
my boat, like...

00:27.193 --> 00:29.696
Oh, yeah, totally.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.406
{\an5}(Garrett)
And the more she wanted
to hang out with them...

00:31.489 --> 00:33.783
{\an1}We're all going swimming later
if you wanna...

00:33.867 --> 00:34.868
Get to know you better.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.077
...the more I found myself

00:36.161 --> 00:37.787
wanting to
get the hell away.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.289
{\an1}You always wanna be
around him, so...

00:39.372 --> 00:40.665
I literally...

00:39.372 --> 00:40.665
I'm gonna go.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.041
(Garrett)
It was a big part

00:42.125 --> 00:43.835
of why we decided
to take a break.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.628
{\an5}(Kelsey)
I was kinda flirting
in the hot tub.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.672
{\an4}And who were you
flirting with?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.672
{\an3}Alex.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.384
{\an1}A real girlfriend
wouldn't flirt with another guy.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.512
{\an5}(Garrett)
Kelsey kept telling me there was
nothing between her and Alex...

00:54.596 --> 00:55.847
If something did happen,

00:55.930 --> 00:57.557
{\an1}I'm not gonna be
the boyfriend anymore.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.434
...but after their trip
to Bimini,

00:59.517 --> 01:01.811
it was getting
harder to believe her.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.483
{\an1}Kelsey was like, "Alex
and I are going on a date."

01:06.566 --> 01:07.901
There's no spark,
there's nothing.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.569
(Garrett)
The truth is, I had no idea

01:09.652 --> 01:11.112
what was going on
with her and Alex,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.490
but I was about to find out.

{\an1}like, there's a lot of tension

going to Chloe's party.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.839
{\an8}I like him, but...

04:16.923 --> 04:19.509
{\an7}I told him when we talked
that I don't really want to,

04:19.591 --> 04:22.095
{\an7}so I feel like
if I just don't do anything,

04:22.178 --> 04:24.806
{\an7}I'll just, like...
stop feeling that way.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.350

(laughs)

04:29.394 --> 04:31.688
{\an1}Who, me?

04:31.771 --> 04:33.690
So, I'm having this...

04:33.773 --> 04:35.900
housewarming pool party...

04:35.984 --> 04:38.695
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.695
...and I invited Garrett.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.406
You know I don't want him
to feel like

04:41.489 --> 04:43.324
{\an5}he can't, like,
come hang around with us.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.324
{\an1}Hang out.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.701
Yeah, that's not fair.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.036
From what Garrett
was telling me,

04:47.120 --> 04:50.790
it seems like Kelsey
isn't being...

04:50.873 --> 04:52.667
fully honest
with him.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.210
And then Garrett
said to me,

04:54.293 --> 04:57.463
{\an1}like, if anything did happen
between Kelsey and Alex,

04:57.547 --> 05:01.175
like, he would never
wanna be her friend again.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.971
{\an1}Huh.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.971
And that's why I think

05:05.054 --> 05:07.890
Kelsey's, like, trying
to convince him so much

05:07.974 --> 05:10.059
that she has
no interest in Alex,

05:10.143 --> 05:11.519
because she doesn't wanna
lose both,

05:11.602 --> 05:13.896
{\an1}but it's like, you don't get
the best of both worlds.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.315
You either tell Garrett
the truth

05:16.399 --> 05:18.568
or don't pursue Alex.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.568
{\an1}Yeah.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.069
'Cause she's clearly
all over him.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.572

05:20.153 --> 05:22.572
{\an3}Yeah.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.366
{\an4}And he's so cute.

{\an3}Yeah.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.025
{\an1}--I could definitely see
the chemistry.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.194
I've known him
for so long

06:01.277 --> 06:03.821
and we've gotten to really
connect, you know?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.616

06:06.699 --> 06:08.117
{\an1}Yeah.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.117
{\an3}--together.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.452
And Brandon and I
haven't had the chance.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.789
{\an1}So, when you had both
Brandon and Grant there,

06:12.872 --> 06:14.165
{\an1}did it kind of make things
any clearer

06:14.248 --> 06:16.334
or did it--

06:14.248 --> 06:16.334
{\an3}No! No!

06:16.417 --> 06:17.794
{\an1}Really?

06:16.417 --> 06:17.794
{\an3}Not at all.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.253
It confused you more?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.253
{\an3}Yes!

06:19.337 --> 06:21.506
It was very confusing.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.049
{\an1}Yeah.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.049
{\an3}And...

06:23.132 --> 06:24.759
Could you see yourself
committing to Brandon?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.843
He's been so good
with my family.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.804
{\an1}Really?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.804
So good. Yeah.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.472
{\an1}It's attractive that he can,
like, you know, totally--

06:29.555 --> 06:31.015

06:29.555 --> 06:31.015
{\an3}Yes!

06:31.099 --> 06:33.976
{\an1}But, yes, I, I think...
I'm gonna go to his studio.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.814
{\an4}Uh-oh.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.814
Like, there's something about
just, like, a musician and--

06:37.897 --> 06:38.689
Yeah, it's cool.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.689
{\an3}Yeah.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.984
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know...

06:42.068 --> 06:43.111

06:43.194 --> 06:44.320
if that makes you
feel any better.

06:44.403 --> 06:49.158

afterwards...

06:49.242 --> 06:51.119
