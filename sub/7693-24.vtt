00:11.782 --> 00:14.615

WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT

00:14.615 --> 00:17.248
A RECORD OF THIS
AWKWARD PHASE OF YOUR LIVES--

00:17.248 --> 00:18.249

00:25.456 --> 00:27.328
WELL, THAT SETTLES THAT.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.560
I AM SO GETTING MY HAIR DONE
RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.463
OH! CAN YOU BRING ME BACK
SOME CLIPPINGS OFF THE FLOOR?

00:32.463 --> 00:34.765
I NEED 'EM TO FINISH BUILDING
MY "TAJ MAHAIR."

00:38.609 --> 00:41.272
WHERE DID ALL OF
THAT HAIR COME FROM?

00:41.272 --> 00:43.614
PETS, SHOWER DRAINS,
BRUSHES--

00:43.614 --> 00:46.417
IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU CAN GET IT.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.279
WELL, THAT IS DISGUSTING.

00:48.279 --> 00:50.321
YEAH. WELL, IF YOU THINK
THAT'S GROSS,

00:50.321 --> 00:53.384
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
"BUCKINGHAIR PALACE."

00:55.156 --> 00:57.588
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED
ABOUT A STUPID YEARBOOK PHOTO?

00:57.588 --> 01:00.561
I AM STILL TRYING TO LIVE DOWN
LAST YEAR'S PICTURE

01:00.561 --> 01:03.764
WHEN I WASN'T READY
FOR THE FLASH
AND MY EYES GLITCHED.

01:05.596 --> 01:08.539
All: UGHH.

01:08.539 --> 01:12.403
BREE, YOUR ZOMBIE PICTURE
WAS THE LEAST OF THE PROBLEMS
WITH THE YEARBOOK.

01:12.403 --> 01:15.306
PERRY PHOTO-BOMBED
EVERY GROUP PICTURE.

01:15.306 --> 01:16.607

SWIM TEAM--

01:23.184 --> 01:24.515
NO! NO, NO, NO!

01:24.515 --> 01:27.518
NONE OF US NEED
TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

01:27.518 --> 01:30.261
( bell rings )

01:30.261 --> 01:32.693
Boy: MOVE THIRTY-TWO!
HUT! HUT!

01:35.126 --> 01:37.328
YEAH!

 YEAH!

01:37.328 --> 01:39.099
TRENT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.671
USING FOOTBALL PRACTICE
AS AN EXCUSE

01:40.671 --> 01:42.573
TO KNOCK OVER
INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.

01:42.573 --> 01:46.177
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN
FOOTBALL SEASON.

01:46.177 --> 01:49.140
TRUE, BUT IT'S ALWAYS
TACKLING SEASON.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.711
HEADS UP!

01:50.711 --> 01:52.343
All: AAAAH!

01:53.684 --> 01:55.686

OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M ONLY BEING NICE

02:10.431 --> 02:12.163
YOU GUYS...

02:12.163 --> 02:14.665

PASS MY HISTORY TEST.

02:14.665 --> 02:16.267
YOU DON'T EVEN TAKE HISTORY.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.509
THE ONLY CLASS
YOU HAVE LEFT
IS PHYSICS.

02:18.509 --> 02:21.212
AND SINCE WHEN DO YOU
CARE ABOUT TAKING TESTS?

02:21.212 --> 02:23.644
THERE IS A LOT ABOUT ME
YOU DON'T KNOW.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.176
I HAVE MANY LAYERS.

02:25.176 --> 02:26.877
I AM VERY DENSE.

02:26.877 --> 02:28.619
HMM. YES.

02:28.619 --> 02:30.721
YES, YOU ARE.

02:30.721 --> 02:33.554
LOOK, PERRY SAYS
I CAN'T FAIL AGAIN.

02:33.554 --> 02:36.727
OH, BUT YOU CAN.
IT'S KIND OF YOUR THING.

02:36.727 --> 02:39.230
COME ON,
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF TRICK.

02:39.230 --> 02:42.162
LIKE, WHAT'S THAT THING
YOU DO THAT MAKES YOU
PASS TESTS?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.335
IT'S CALLED STUDYING.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.166
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

02:47.568 --> 02:48.599
HOW ABOUT THIS?

02:48.599 --> 02:49.940
WE HELP YOU PASS,

02:49.940 --> 02:52.543
YOU MOVE FOOTBALL PRACTICE
BACK OUTSIDE.

02:52.543 --> 02:55.706
YEAH. I GUESS
I COULD DO THAT.

02:55.706 --> 02:58.579
HMM. THAT WAS EASY.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.282
COME ON, GUYS,
WE'RE TAKING THIS OUTSIDE.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.754
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME TACKLING DUMMIES...

03:04.815 --> 03:06.617
( all shouting )
 NO! NO!

03:06.617 --> 03:07.918
NO! NO!

03:11.262 --> 03:14.495
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

03:14.495 --> 03:15.966
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US...

03:15.966 --> 03:18.499
FASTER, SMARTER.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.871
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:20.871 --> 03:23.274
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

03:23.274 --> 03:26.237
♪♪

04:03.013 --> 04:05.015
MAN, I CAN'T STAND TRENT.

04:05.015 --> 04:07.478
WHY DO WE HAVE TO HELP HIM
PASS HIS TEST?

04:07.478 --> 04:09.320
BECAUSE HE'S BIG
AND WE'RE SMALL.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.721
BECAUSE PERRY LIKES HIM
AND HATES US.

04:10.721 --> 04:12.383
BECAUSE HE HAS ALL THE POWER
AND WE DON'T.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.325
I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON.

04:14.325 --> 04:17.288
YOU KNOW, SINCE
HE NEEDS OUR HELP,

04:17.288 --> 04:19.529
TECHNICALLY WE HAVE
THE POWER IN THE SITUATION.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.332
WE CONTROL
WHAT HE LEARNS.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.834
AH, YES. I'M GONNA SPEAK
IN A TONE THAT SUGGESTS

04:23.834 --> 04:25.035
I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS,

04:25.035 --> 04:27.338
BUT WAIT FOR YOU
TO TELL ME MORE.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.402
THESE ARE DAVENGLASSES.

04:31.402 --> 04:35.346
GEE, SOMEONE NEEDS TO HAVE
THEIR NAME ON EVERYTHING.

04:35.346 --> 04:37.708
THEY'RE A SUBLIMINAL
LEARNING DEVICE

04:37.708 --> 04:39.650
THAT HELPS THE USER

AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
TECH MOGUL OF SILICON VALLEY,

04:50.421 --> 04:51.962
BUT HE'S SO MUCH MORE.

04:51.962 --> 04:53.324
A TRUE FASHIONISTA,

04:53.324 --> 04:55.025
HE'S EVEN ABLE TO MAKE
SEQUINS MANLY.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.296
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.068
NO, LET'S NOT HAVE A LOOK.

04:59.630 --> 05:00.801
OKAY, THOSE ARE COOL AND ALL,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.873
BUT HOW ARE THEY GONNA
HELP US WITH TRENT?

05:02.873 --> 05:06.877
WE'LL GET EVEN WITH HIM
BY PROGRAMMING THE GLASSES
WITH FAKE FACTS.

05:06.877 --> 05:09.480
THE GLASSES SAID
THAT BIG D LOOKS MANLY.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.882
THEY'RE ALREADY FILLED
WITH FAKE FACTS.

05:18.849 --> 05:21.622
IN A WORLD OVERTAKEN
BY WARM BREAD,

05:21.622 --> 05:24.795
ONE MAN MUST TAKE ON
BAKED GOODS ALONE.

05:24.795 --> 05:27.097
ADAM DAVENPORT IS...

05:27.097 --> 05:29.400
THE TOASTMASTER.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.776
HEY, ADAM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY HAIR?

05:51.822 --> 05:54.555
I HOPE YOU KEPT YOUR RECEIPT,
'CAUSE IT LOOKS UNEVEN.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.059
AAH!

05:59.059 --> 06:01.091
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

06:01.091 --> 06:03.063
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.066
YOUR HAIR WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE
TO A WORLD GONE MAD!

06:07.898 --> 06:10.140
THE YEARBOOK PICTURE
IS TOMORROW.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.102
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
ABOUT MY HAIR?

06:12.102 --> 06:14.074
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU SHOULD PUT ON A HAT.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.576
IT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE.

06:17.107 --> 06:18.849
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO BACK TO THE SALON

06:18.849 --> 06:21.381
AND GET THE SAME HAIRCUT
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.083
YOU BURNED IT OFF!

06:23.083 --> 06:25.456
A SALON CAN'T FIX THIS!

06:25.456 --> 06:27.958
WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU
PAYING 'EM ALL THAT MONEY?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.522
MR. DAVENPORT!

06:31.522 --> 06:33.424
WOW! YOU LOOK AWFUL.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.895
WHAT, DID YOU LOSE A BET?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.528
NO, ADAM DID THIS.

06:37.528 --> 06:39.630
WHY WOULD YOU LET ADAM
CUT YOUR HAIR?

06:39.630 --> 06:41.131
THAT'S ON YOU, GIRLY.

06:41.131 --> 06:43.934
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
BUT YOU CAN FIX THIS,
RIGHT?

06:43.934 --> 06:47.508
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE
SOME KIND OF FANCY DAVENPORT
HAIR GROWTH SOLUTION.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.979
WHY WOULD I HAVE THAT?

06:48.979 --> 06:51.482
I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE
YOU WEAR THAT CRAZY WIG.

06:51.482 --> 06:54.184
THIS IS MY REAL HAIR.

06:54.184 --> 06:56.116
OH, THAT'S EVEN SADDER.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.191
WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TAKE A YEARBOOK PHOTO
TOMORROW

07:01.191 --> 07:03.023
WITH HALF OF MY HAIR MISSING?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.125
WELL, IT CAN'T BE
ANY WORSE THAN LAST YEAR.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.727
URRR...URRR...

07:06.727 --> 07:09.900
I'M KIDDING. DON'T WORRY,
I'M SURE I CAN MODIFY

07:09.900 --> 07:12.132
SOME OVER-THE-COUNTER
HAIR GROWTH SERUM

07:12.132 --> 07:13.864
TO REGROW YOUR HAIR
OVERNIGHT.

07:13.864 --> 07:16.006
I'M KIND OF BUSY,
BUT I CAN PROBABLY GO LATER--

07:16.006 --> 07:18.569
(demonic voice)
DO IT NOW!!!

07:22.172 --> 07:24.444
SO COME ON--
WIG, RIGHT?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.616
OHH!

07:28.649 --> 07:30.150

 ( giggles )

07:30.150 --> 07:32.052
THAT'S TRENT!

07:32.052 --> 07:33.884
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU LAUGH LIKE THAT

07:33.884 --> 07:36.156
I CAN SEE HOW TRENT
PICKS ON YOU.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.190
AND AS MUCH AS I WANT
TO GET EVEN WITH HIM,

07:40.190 --> 07:43.063
ISN'T THIS JUST GONNA
BLOW UP IN OUR FACE
WHEN HE FAILS THE TEST?

07:43.063 --> 07:46.066
OR MAYBE HE'LL NEVER
 WANT OUR HELP AGAIN.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.068
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO
A BAD JOB WITH THE DISHES

07:48.068 --> 07:49.700
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO 'EM ANYMORE.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.802
HEY, THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
OF MY SENSITIVE SKIN.

07:51.802 --> 07:55.205
THESE DANDY HANDS
DON'T DANCE IN DISHWATER.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.907
( doorbell )

07:59.109 --> 08:02.052
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK.
I GOT A FULL SCHEDULE TONIGHT.

08:02.052 --> 08:05.155
OF WHAT, TERRORIZING KIDS
AND DESTROYING PRIVATE PROPERTY?

08:05.155 --> 08:07.117
YEAH.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.920
OKAY, TRENT,
SINCE YOU ASKED US

08:09.920 --> 08:12.022
TO HELP YOU STUDY
FOR YOUR TEST,

08:12.022 --> 08:14.224
WE DECIDED TO LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET

08:14.224 --> 08:16.496
AS TO HOW WE STUDY
AND GET GOOD GRADES.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.870
IS YOUR SECRET
HAVING NO FRIENDS
AND BEING BAD AT SPORTS?

08:19.870 --> 08:22.102
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.574
THIS GUY...

08:25.275 --> 08:27.137
LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

08:27.137 --> 08:30.180
IS WEAR THESE SPECIAL GLASSES
FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.082
THESE WILL IMPLANT FACTS
INTO YOUR BRAIN.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.086
I DON'T NEED THE "FACTS,"
I NEED THE ANSWERS.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.821
THOSE ARE IN THERE, TOO.
 MM-HMM.

08:44.595 --> 08:46.226
( glasses beep )

08:46.226 --> 08:47.958
Chase's voice:
 HERE IS EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

08:47.958 --> 08:49.560
ABOUT PHYSICS.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.931
Leo's voice:
 KINETIC ENERGY

08:50.931 --> 08:53.303
IS THE STUDY
OF ENERGY IN CONNECTICUT.

08:53.303 --> 08:56.907
DUH.
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT?

08:56.907 --> 09:00.010
Chase: SIR ISAAC NEWTON
CHOPPED DOWN HIS FATHER'S
CHERRY TREE

09:00.010 --> 09:01.572
AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT.

09:01.572 --> 09:05.315
OH. I THOUGHT THAT
WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON.

09:05.315 --> 09:07.147
Leo: THERMAL EXPANSION
OCCURS

09:07.147 --> 09:10.050
WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING HOT
AND GET HUGE.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.754
MY DAD HAS THAT!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.125
THESE ARE AWESOME!

09:15.125 --> 09:17.557
IT'S JUST LIKE TV
EXCEPT WITHOUT COMMERCIALS,

09:17.557 --> 09:19.129
OR MY MOM TELLING ME
TO PUT ON PANTS.

09:25.135 --> 09:28.198
OKAY, I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
ACCELERATED

09:28.198 --> 09:31.041
THIS OVER-THE-COUNTER
HAIR GROWTH CREAM
TO WORK MUCH FASTER.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.674
WELL, IS IT GONNA WORK
IN TIME FOR THE YEARBOOK PICTURE
TOMORROW?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.976
IF IT DOESN'T, YOU CAN ALWAYS
WEAR MR. DAVENPORT'S WIG.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.108
IT'S NOT A WIG!

09:38.108 --> 09:40.280
OHH. FINE. TOUPEE.

09:41.752 --> 09:44.314
LOOK, THE HAIR SHOULD REGROW
OVERNIGHT. DON'T WORRY.

09:44.314 --> 09:45.585
I'M NOT WORRIED.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.317
(demonic voice)
YOU SHOULD BE!!!

09:51.261 --> 09:54.124
THAT IS PURE, UNBRIDLED
GIRL ANGER.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.726
FEAR IT.

09:56.927 --> 09:58.899
(ringtones play)
 OH.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.101
SHOOT, I HAVE
A CONFERENCE CALL
WITH TOKYO.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.903
I FORGOT THEY'RE
A DAY AHEAD.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.777
A DAY AHEAD?
ASK 'EM WHAT I'M GONNA
HAVE FOR BREAKFAST TOMORROW.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.079
AND IT BETTER
NOT BE OATMEAL.

10:09.079 --> 10:12.382
LOOK, JUST APPLY
A LITTLE MORE
AND YOU SHOULD BE GOOD.

10:12.382 --> 10:13.784
OKAY.

10:15.145 --> 10:16.316
ALL RIGHT.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.320
THERE. I THINK
 I GOT ALL OF IT.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.793
CAN YOU CHECK TO MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T MISS A SPOT?
 SURE.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.224
OH, YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.227
UH-OH.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "UH-OH"?

10:30.200 --> 10:33.263
UH...

10:33.263 --> 10:35.365
OH, YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK SO GOOD.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.115
HEY, IT WORKED.

10:45.115 --> 10:46.116
REALLY?

10:46.116 --> 10:47.217
AAAAH!

10:47.217 --> 10:50.120
WHAT IS WRONG?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.922
AAAAAH!!!

10:51.922 --> 10:53.083
WHAT?!

10:54.224 --> 10:56.256
AAAAH!!!

10:56.256 --> 10:57.788
AAHH....

10:57.788 --> 10:59.329
WAIT. ARE YOU SCREAMING
BECAUSE WE SCREAMED

10:59.329 --> 11:01.131
OR BECAUSE YOU SAW
HOW UGLY YOU LOOKED?

11:07.237 --> 11:08.769
HAS TRENT GOT
HIS TEST RESULTS YET?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.270
NO, BUT HE'S ABOUT TO.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.942
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIS FACE
WHEN HE FINDS OUT

11:11.942 --> 11:13.073
HOW BADLY HE DID.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.877
YOU DO KNOW HE'S GONNA
COME AFTER US

11:16.877 --> 11:18.979
AND WE CAN'T
OUTRUN HIM, RIGHT?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.411
OH. I DON'T HAVE
TO OUTRUN HIM.

11:21.411 --> 11:23.353
I JUST HAVE TO
OUTRUN YOU.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.118
WELL, TRENT,
I GOT THE SCORE BACK
ON YOUR PHYSICS TEST.

11:28.118 --> 11:30.260
YOU GOT A HUNDRED PERCENT--
 YES!!!

11:30.260 --> 11:32.022
OF THE ANSWERS WRONG.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.163
( mouthing words )

11:33.163 --> 11:35.425
WAIT. WHAT?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

11:35.425 --> 11:37.828
I GOT HELP FROM
DOOLEY AND NOT-DOOLEY.

11:37.828 --> 11:40.300
THEY EVEN GAVE ME THESE
MAGIC LEARNING GLASSES.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.332
MAGIC LEARNING GLASSES?

11:42.332 --> 11:44.474
THAT'S DUMB
EVEN FOR YOU.

11:46.406 --> 11:50.210
WAIT, I DON'T GET IT.
THEY LEARNED ME THINGS.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.342
THEY SET YOU UP,
FEATHER-BRAIN!

11:52.342 --> 11:54.214
UHHH!

11:54.214 --> 11:57.247
WHEN I FIND THEM,
I AM GONNA DO THIS TO THEM!

11:59.790 --> 12:02.923
EXCEPT IT'S GONNA TAKE LONGER
AND BE A LOT MORE PAINFUL.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.256
HEY!

12:06.256 --> 12:08.058
SMOKEY! BANDIT!
GET DOWN HERE!

12:11.001 --> 12:13.033
I HOPE YOU TWO
ARE HAPPY.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.304
WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED,

12:14.304 --> 12:16.266
I WOULD SAY
WE FEEL ECSTATIC.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.238
WHAT WORD WOULD YOU USE,
LEO?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.040
I FEEL COMPLETE.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.013
WELL, ENJOY THAT VICTORY,

12:23.013 --> 12:24.815
BECAUSE IF TRENT
HAD PASSED THAT CLASS,

12:24.815 --> 12:26.446
HE WOULD HAVE
FINALLY GRADUATED.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.248
STILL FEEL COMPLETE?
( clicks tongue )

12:30.220 --> 12:32.022
WAIT, SO THAT MEANS--

12:32.022 --> 12:35.185
WE MISSED OUR CHANCE
TO GET RID OF TRENT FOREVER.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.191
THERE YOU ARE.
I'M GONNA CHOP YOU DOWN

12:41.191 --> 12:43.193
LIKE SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S
CHERRY TREE.

12:43.193 --> 12:46.396
I MAY BE SLOW,
BUT I KNOW HOW
TO PLAY DIRTY!

12:46.396 --> 12:48.038
YAH!
 OOH!

12:49.469 --> 12:51.241
( growls )

12:51.241 --> 12:53.103
AAAH!!!

13:00.510 --> 13:03.483
PRINCIPAL PERRY, HELP!
TRENT IS CHASING US!

13:03.483 --> 13:06.216
AAAH!
GET OFF ME!

13:06.216 --> 13:07.958
THE STATE SAYS
I CAN'T FIGHT BACK,

13:07.958 --> 13:09.559
BUT IF I CARED
WHAT THE STATE SAID,

13:09.559 --> 13:12.222
I WOULDN'T HAVE
WALLPAPERED MY KITCHEN
WITH PARKING TICKETS!

13:13.393 --> 13:15.926
LOOK, WE'RE SORRY
FOR SETTING TRENT UP.

13:15.926 --> 13:18.198
JUST PLEASE, PLEASE
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.200
WE'LL HELP HIM STUDY.
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.102
DON'T TRUST HIM!
IT'S A TRAP!

13:22.102 --> 13:24.204
FOOL ME ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.276
FOOL ME TWICE...

13:26.276 --> 13:27.277
I'M GONNA HIT YOU!

13:27.277 --> 13:28.278
NAH-UHH!

13:29.880 --> 13:32.112
WELL, SINCE IT WASN'T
TECHNICALLY TRENT'S FAULT,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.244
HE CAN RETAKE THE TEST
TOMORROW.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.146
OOH! BURNED!

13:36.146 --> 13:39.920
'CAUSE OF YOU TWO,
I GOTTA TAKE ANOTHER TEST.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.292
WAIT. WHAT?!

13:42.292 --> 13:46.256
THAT GIVES YOU TWO
THE REST OF THE DAY
TO HELP HIM STUDY.

13:46.256 --> 13:49.900
SO YOU DON'T CARE IF WE
SKIP OUR CLASSES TODAY?

13:49.900 --> 13:52.232
I CARE VERY LITTLE
ABOUT YOU.

13:54.905 --> 13:58.138
I'VE ALREADY MISSED
HALF OF SCHOOL, AND MY PICTURE
IS THIS AFTERNOON!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.910
MY LIFE IS OVER!

13:59.910 --> 14:03.143
I'M JUST GONNA DROP OUT
AND SELL TRINKETS ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.947
HONEY, NOBODY WOULD
BUY ANYTHING FROM YOU
LOOKING LIKE THAT.

14:08.218 --> 14:09.950
FIX MY FACE!

14:09.950 --> 14:11.421
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG.

14:11.421 --> 14:13.283
I TRIPLE-CHECKED THE FORMULA,
AND IT'S CORRECT.

14:13.283 --> 14:17.127
OKAY, WELL THEN WHY
DO I LOOK LIKE A GENERAL
FROM THE CIVIL WAR?

14:19.589 --> 14:22.862
THE ONLY OTHER EXPLANATION
IS THAT THE CREAM WAS APPLIED
INCORRECTLY.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.164
HOW MUCH DID YOU USE?

14:24.164 --> 14:26.196
I ONLY USED A LITTLE BIT,
LIKE YOU SAID.

14:26.196 --> 14:28.999
AND THEN ADAM
DID THE BACK--

14:28.999 --> 14:31.641
OHH.
 OHH.

14:31.641 --> 14:33.173
HOLD ON.

14:35.105 --> 14:37.207
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

14:37.207 --> 14:39.379
I'D JUST FALLEN ASLEEP
IN MATH CLASS.

14:39.379 --> 14:43.213
HOW MUCH OF THAT HAIR CREAM
DID YOU USE ON ME?

14:43.213 --> 14:44.214
ALL OF IT.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.615
WHAT?!
 WHAT?!

14:45.615 --> 14:48.258
WELL, I ACCIDENTALLY
SQUEEZED OUT TOO MUCH,

14:48.258 --> 14:51.261
AND I DIDN'T WANT HAIRY HANDS,
SO I HAD TO WIPE IT SOMEWHERE.

14:52.362 --> 14:55.425
OH, MAN, NOW I DO
 WANT HAIRY HANDS.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.170
I CANNOT GET MY YEARBOOK PICTURE
TAKEN LOOKING LIKE THIS.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.032
WELL, IF YOU DO,
I WANT AN 8 x 10,

15:02.032 --> 15:03.303
TWO COFFEE MUGS
AND A MOUSE PAD.

15:05.175 --> 15:07.277
I WILL LOOK FOR
A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION,

15:07.277 --> 15:09.439
BUT FOR NOW JUST CUT OFF
THE EXCESS HAIR FOR THE PHOTO.

15:09.439 --> 15:12.482
OKAY, BUT HURRY UP!
I CAN'T BE SEEN LIKE THIS.

15:12.482 --> 15:15.986
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT PEOPLE WILL CALL ME?

15:15.986 --> 15:18.949
MEAN PEOPLE MIGHT CALL YOU
"SPARKY THE DOG-FACE GIRL,"

15:18.949 --> 15:20.690
BUT I'D CALL YOU
"POOCHES THE DOG-FACE GIRL"

15:20.690 --> 15:22.492
BECAUSE THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME.

15:25.655 --> 15:29.960
PRESSURE EQUALS FORCE...

15:29.960 --> 15:31.231
OVER...?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.710
WHAT IS THAT?

15:40.710 --> 15:42.612
TRENTOSAURUS REX.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.416
I'M ABOUT TO EAT YOU.

15:48.418 --> 15:52.052
OKAY. MAYBE HE'S MORE
OF A VISUAL LEARNER.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.525
SO THIS DEMONSTRATES
CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM.

15:59.189 --> 16:02.292
ARE YOU DRAWING
ANOTHER TRENTOSAURUS REX?

16:02.292 --> 16:04.164
NO!

16:04.164 --> 16:06.166
IT'S A TRENTODACTYL.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.400
GUESS WHAT HE EATS.

16:12.342 --> 16:14.044
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.145
OH, REALLY?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.710
UHH!
 OHH!

16:20.710 --> 16:22.182
HA HA HA!

16:22.182 --> 16:24.614
NOW THAT'S CONSERVATION
OF MOMENTUM.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.390
I'M STARTING TO THINK
HE ONLY LEARNS WHEN
PEOPLE GET HURT.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.222
WE CAN USE THAT!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.225
I DIDN'T MEAN
WHEN I GET HURT!

16:36.466 --> 16:38.568
OKAY, SO HERE'S
HOW IT WORKS.

16:38.568 --> 16:41.071
FOR EVERY QUESTION
YOU ANSWER CORRECTLY,

16:41.071 --> 16:42.772
YOU GET TO SPIN
THE GYROSCOPE.

16:42.772 --> 16:45.135
THE MORE YOU GET RIGHT,
THE MORE LEO SUFFERS.

16:45.135 --> 16:46.336
WAIT. WHAT?

16:47.637 --> 16:48.638
AWESOME!

16:48.638 --> 16:50.580
NOPE, NOT AWESOME.
 Chase: OKAY,

16:50.580 --> 16:53.443
FIRST QUESTION.
HOW DO YOU CALCULATE FORCE?

16:53.443 --> 16:55.245
OH! I KNOW THIS ONE!

16:55.245 --> 16:57.547
UH, MASS TIMES...

16:57.547 --> 17:00.019
PICTURE LEO SPINNING FAST...

17:00.019 --> 17:01.051
ACCELERATION!

17:01.051 --> 17:02.152
HE'S RIGHT!

17:02.152 --> 17:03.423
NOPE. NOPE.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.526
HA HA HA HA HA HA!
 NO...NO...

17:06.526 --> 17:08.198
NO!!!

17:08.198 --> 17:11.101
UH-OHHHHH...

17:11.101 --> 17:13.303
AAAAH!

17:14.304 --> 17:16.606
TORQUE.
 RIGHT!

17:16.606 --> 17:19.209
YAHHH!
STOP THE SPINNING!

17:20.240 --> 17:21.641
AAAHHH!

17:21.641 --> 17:23.242
APPLIED FORCE?

17:23.242 --> 17:25.275
RIIIIGHT!

17:25.275 --> 17:26.516
AAAH!

17:26.516 --> 17:28.478
AAAAAH!!!!

17:28.478 --> 17:31.721
KINETIC ENERGY!!!

17:31.721 --> 17:33.383
HE'S RIGHT!

17:33.383 --> 17:36.756
AAAAH! AAAHHH!!!!

17:36.756 --> 17:38.758
WHOO!

17:38.758 --> 17:41.060
GIVE HIM A HARD ONE!

17:41.060 --> 17:42.462
WHOA!!!

17:45.064 --> 17:46.596
SO, WHAT THEME
DO YOU WANT?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.199
"MOMMY'S PRECIOUS BABY"?

17:49.199 --> 17:50.200
WAAAAA!

17:52.071 --> 17:53.673
"GIANT NOVELTY CRAYON"?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.845
RRRRRR!

17:55.845 --> 17:58.748
OR MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

17:58.748 --> 17:59.779
"PERRY-ON-A-STICK"?

17:59.779 --> 18:02.282
WATCH OUT,
SQUAT-LOG!

18:02.282 --> 18:05.185
UM, I WOULD JUST LIKE
A NORMAL PHOTO, PLEASE.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.557
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET A NORMAL FACE.

18:07.557 --> 18:09.189
HA HA HA!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.590
OH...

18:18.668 --> 18:20.870
CAN WE HURRY THIS UP?
 PUT IT IN PARK.

18:20.870 --> 18:23.403
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE MOST UNFLATTERING SETTINGS.

18:25.775 --> 18:28.278
PLEASE!
I CAN'T WAIT
MUCH LONGER!

18:28.278 --> 18:29.639
SETTLE DOWN!

18:29.639 --> 18:31.241
THIS IS NOT
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
CAMERA.

18:31.241 --> 18:33.513
I BORROWED IT FROM
THE CIVIL WAR MUSEUM.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.691
TAKE THE PICTURE!

18:41.691 --> 18:44.224
ALL RIGHT,
ON THE COUNT OF THREE SAY,

18:44.224 --> 18:46.226
"I'LL NEVER AMOUNT
TO ANYTHING."

18:46.226 --> 18:47.657
ONE, TWO, THREE.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.561
YEECH.

18:51.561 --> 18:54.264
LOOKS LIKE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR OWN PROPS.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.737
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A COVER PAGE.

18:59.569 --> 19:00.570
OOH! AHH!

19:00.570 --> 19:01.771
WHOA. MY BAD.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.344
I'M OKAY!

19:05.215 --> 19:06.546
WHO PUT THAT THERE?

19:07.617 --> 19:08.648
OOOH!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.751
THAT IS A SAFETY HAZARD.

19:15.325 --> 19:16.686
MY FATHER WILL TAKE
AN 8 x 10,

19:16.686 --> 19:18.488
TWO COFFEE MUGS
AND A MOUSE PAD.

19:27.437 --> 19:29.669
WHAT DO WE DO
IF TRENT DOESN'T PASS?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.702
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M GONNA AIM FOR
YOUR OTHER FOOT AND RUN.

19:34.344 --> 19:37.347
WELL DONE, BOYS.
TRENT PASSED
AND FINALLY GRADUATED.

19:37.347 --> 19:39.649
HE'S NO LONGER A STUDENT
AT MISSION CREEK HIGH.

19:39.649 --> 19:40.780
YES!
 YES!

19:40.780 --> 19:43.253
HE'S SOCIETY'S
PROBLEM NOW!

19:43.253 --> 19:44.514
( whistle blows )

19:44.514 --> 19:47.417
HI, NERDS,
MISS ME?

19:47.417 --> 19:49.519
TRENT, YOU GRADUATED.

19:49.519 --> 19:51.291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE HERE ANYMORE.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.723
YEAH, SHOULDN'T YOU
BE WORKING AT A GAS STATION

19:53.723 --> 19:55.725
OR LIVING AT A GAS STATION?

19:55.725 --> 19:57.467
YOU BELONG AT
A GAS STATION.

19:58.828 --> 20:00.430
NOPE, HE BELONGS HERE.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.872
I JUST HIRED TRENT
AS THE NEW GYM TEACHER.

20:02.872 --> 20:06.205
THAT'S RIGHT.
FROM NOW ON
IT'S "MISTER" TRENT.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.838
THAT'S COLD, TERRY PERRY.
THAT COLD.

20:08.838 --> 20:11.341
HE FULFILLS ALL
THE REQUIREMENTS--

20:11.341 --> 20:12.742
DIRT CHEAP,
HIGH SCHOOL GRAD,

20:12.742 --> 20:16.316
AND HE ALMOST PASSED
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAM.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.917
DID BETTER THEN ME,
ANYWAY.

20:19.489 --> 20:21.521
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP,
GUYS.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.653
NOW I GET PAID
 TO TORTURE YOU.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.224
I DON'T CARE
WHAT MY DAD SAYS,

20:25.224 --> 20:27.497
GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL
 IS WORTH IT.

20:36.466 --> 20:37.707
( blows whistle )

20:37.707 --> 20:39.569
LET'S GO,
SHORT AND SHORTER!

20:39.569 --> 20:41.711
TIME TO SWEAT
TILL YOU CRY!

20:41.711 --> 20:44.344
IT'S NOT EVEN GYM CLASS.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.376
NOW THAT I'M HERE...

20:46.376 --> 20:48.648
IT'S ALWAYS GYM CLASS.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.819
( blows
whistle )

20:52.982 --> 20:54.984
HEY. WE SAW THE YEARBOOK.

20:54.984 --> 20:57.657
YOU TAKE QUITE A PHOTO,
"HAIRY MARY."

20:59.459 --> 21:02.862
YEAH, THE JUNIOR CLASS
JUST RENAMED YOU
"SEÑORITA SASQUATCH."

21:04.033 --> 21:05.965
EH, I'M NOT TOO WORRIED.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.598
PEOPLE ARE GONNA FORGET
ALL ABOUT MY PICTURE

21:08.598 --> 21:10.300
WHEN THEY SEE
WHAT I DID TO ADAM.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.442
Adam: HEY, BREE!
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT

21:12.442 --> 21:14.404
THAT HAIR GEL
YOU GAVE ME...

21:14.404 --> 21:16.576
BUT I'M LOVIN' IT.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.378
♪ ( disco ) ♪

21:21.711 --> 21:23.052
WHOOOO!

21:23.052 --> 21:24.814
OHH!
 EWWW!
 AHHH!
