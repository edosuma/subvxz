07:38.730 --> 07:41.956
I'm so sorry, Ali.
I love you so much.

07:54.978 --> 07:57.912
All right, look here.
It's always "six won't work"?

07:58.592 --> 07:59.688
Plans are heavy as always?

08:00.501 --> 08:02.074
I'll be waiting for you today.

08:02.368 --> 08:03.764
Same time and place.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.324
No questions as always.
See you there, Hazel.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.759
- Nice day.
- Yeah. Were you followed?

08:16.148 --> 08:17.138
- Nope.
- Are you sure?

08:17.218 --> 08:18.393
- Yup.
- Ana.

08:27.123 --> 08:28.820
I told you after the last job,
I'm done.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.460
- Do as you're told.
- Don't touch me!

08:32.681 --> 08:34.604
Lay your weapon down! Ana!

08:34.816 --> 08:36.892
- What?
- Pull your fucking weapon down now.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.664
Look at me, Hazel.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.784
We have worked together well.
You and I, brother.

08:42.306 --> 08:44.115
I see you to deliver
this package for me.

08:44.195 --> 08:45.272
To me then, for cash.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.455
We will deliver it to you.
Then you walk away.

08:48.535 --> 08:50.337
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

08:56.507 --> 09:00.007
You got to be kidding me. Rakovski?
As in the Royal Family?

09:00.227 --> 09:02.852
- You're very bright Mr. Kaine.
- Shut up.

09:04.703 --> 09:07.137
- I'm not going to be able
to get within ten feet of these kids.
- You can.

09:07.313 --> 09:10.706
You can. And you will.
Because you are the best.

09:12.694 --> 09:14.717
- When?
- 3 P.M. tomorrow.

09:15.238 --> 09:16.405
Wait for my call.

09:21.793 --> 09:22.695
Take care, Brother.

09:39.349 --> 09:40.993
It's going to be
easier than you think.

09:41.073 --> 09:43.043
No security detail, just one driver.

09:43.123 --> 09:45.862
Black Mercedes 6-0-9-H-5-0-4.

09:46.148 --> 09:48.198
Use the container,
hand over the keys,

09:48.278 --> 09:49.950
and we will take care
of it from there.

09:50.030 --> 09:53.008
When they pass, we'll pay you.
Don't fuck it up.

09:58.288 --> 09:59.419
See you tomorrow.

10:03.368 --> 10:04.386
Bye.

10:04.466 --> 10:07.171
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

10:51.002 --> 10:52.893
Hey man, I'm real sorry.
I didn't...

10:53.476 --> 10:55.182
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

11:05.976 --> 11:07.779
- Who are you?
- A friend of your dads.

11:08.353 --> 11:10.173
So just sit back and enjoy the ride.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.596
I am going to call him.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.129
- No!
- Quiet!

12:08.206 --> 12:09.885
Ah, Goddammit!

12:11.714 --> 12:12.687
Comeback! Stop!

12:21.299 --> 12:23.499
Goddamn early for this shit!

12:24.319 --> 12:26.011
You think that's funny?

12:26.108 --> 12:28.194
Making an old man like me run.

12:29.348 --> 12:31.363
Sit. Boxes.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.372
Now, I'm going to take the tape off.

12:42.797 --> 12:45.050
I don't want any screaming.
Understand?

12:49.675 --> 12:51.770
What did I say? No screaming.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.194
Okay, I got some water.

12:57.458 --> 13:02.119
Are you thirsty? There you got some
cookies, chips, alright?

13:02.318 --> 13:04.079
Now, I'm going to take
this tape off again.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.441
I really don't want to hear
any screaming. Understand?

13:10.292 --> 13:12.395
Do you have any idea
who our daddy is?

13:12.475 --> 13:15.276
He will come for us.
Him and his friends.

13:15.567 --> 13:16.946
Then you'll be in trouble.

13:18.204 --> 13:20.792
- You're going to regret this.
- I already do.

13:23.956 --> 13:25.494
Why are you doing this to us?

13:25.574 --> 13:28.030
If it's money you want,
our father will pay you.

13:28.110 --> 13:28.984
I'm sure he will.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.285
<i>- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Alys! Alys, get away from him.</i>

13:34.126 --> 13:34.992
What are you doing?

13:35.248 --> 13:36.379
Giving you a hug.

13:36.459 --> 13:39.384
My momma always told me
when someone looks sad,

13:39.605 --> 13:41.002
you should give them a hug.

13:43.251 --> 13:44.713
Alys, come here.

13:48.613 --> 13:50.937
Wait. What is that?

13:52.896 --> 13:56.015
Hey! Give it back!
My mommy gave it to me.

13:56.095 --> 13:58.180
- It's magical. It protects me.
- From what?

13:58.498 --> 14:01.029
- Things you don't believe in.
- Right. Sit down.

14:02.116 --> 14:03.088
Sit!

14:11.600 --> 14:13.862
Don't worry, kids.
You won't be here for long.

14:58.835 --> 14:59.674
Help!

15:02.291 --> 15:03.166
Let us out!

16:45.986 --> 16:48.301
Hey. Hey, uhh. Hey, hey! Hey.

18:28.814 --> 18:30.890
Hey! Come! Quickly!

18:39.599 --> 18:41.909
Listen. Sounds like it's leaving.

18:43.884 --> 18:46.553
- What the hell was that thing?
- This? A dragon.

18:46.633 --> 18:48.541
- You've never seen a dragon before?
- How could he not?

18:48.621 --> 18:49.907
Everyone has seen a dragon.

18:49.987 --> 18:51.843
- Maybe he's a...
- Is this some kind of fucking joke?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.681
How did you shoot air
with that sound?

18:53.761 --> 18:55.637
- Is it magic?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

18:57.514 --> 19:01.702
- Is it magic? No. It's a gun.
- May I see this magic gun?

19:04.323 --> 19:05.374
Where are you from?

19:05.948 --> 19:08.290
America. I work in Bulgaria.

19:09.153 --> 19:11.009
We are in Bulgaria.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.701
I'm losing my fucking mind.

19:17.397 --> 19:18.253
- What?
- I'm losing my mind...

19:18.333 --> 19:20.213
- He's crazy. No, he's not.
- I'm losing my mind.

19:20.372 --> 19:22.513
- He just speaks funny.
- He sorcerer.

19:22.884 --> 19:25.726
- We must take him to Ulric at once.
- Take me to who?

19:26.227 --> 19:27.924
Ulric. He's our Shaman.

19:28.092 --> 19:29.762
- Your Chairman?
- Shaman! A Shaman!

19:36.678 --> 19:37.923
Hey, stop.

19:39.222 --> 19:40.053
Emeline, look!

19:41.361 --> 19:42.601
Where did you get this marking.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.116
Our father had this marking.
No one else has it.

19:45.196 --> 19:46.292
And neither should you!

19:47.935 --> 19:49.596
He was King of this land.

19:50.763 --> 19:52.292
Five years ago, he was killed.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.191
And the castle was taken
by his brother. Terrowin.

19:55.756 --> 19:57.700
Please stranger,
where did you get it?

19:59.166 --> 20:02.091
Venice, California.
My wife picked it out for me.

20:02.771 --> 20:03.354
Wife?

20:05.516 --> 20:06.497
Where is your wife?

20:06.940 --> 20:07.884
She's dead.

20:10.144 --> 20:12.433
- I'm sorry.
- What's your name, stranger?

20:12.891 --> 20:15.250
- Hazen.
- Hazen? I like it.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.386
I'm Emiline
and this is my sister Arabella.

20:19.090 --> 20:20.115
- Come.
- Let's go.

20:20.506 --> 20:23.307
If someone some can help you,
it will be our Shaman.

20:24.552 --> 20:25.683
So let me get this straight,

20:25.763 --> 20:27.434
We aren't going to see the dragon
again, right?

20:27.526 --> 20:28.971
We are safe. For now.

20:35.107 --> 20:36.697
- I don't do horses.
- Why?

20:37.130 --> 20:38.871
What do you mean, Why?
I can't ride a horse.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.532
- Quite simple.
- For you maybe.

20:41.354 --> 20:43.713
- How far away is Ulric?
- Many miles away.

20:44.093 --> 20:45.445
Now go on the horse.

20:56.665 --> 20:59.245
Fucking dragons.
Fucking horses.

21:03.115 --> 21:03.760
Fuck.

21:14.782 --> 21:17.162
Very graceful. Born horseman.

21:24.197 --> 21:26.023
Okay. Let's go.

21:33.978 --> 21:36.815
GODDAMIT!! Fucking horses!

21:37.529 --> 21:39.455
I told you! I don't ride!

21:39.800 --> 21:41.382
Fuck. Stupid animal.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.738
Come up here.
He will ride with me.

21:55.242 --> 21:56.028
Jump!

21:58.492 --> 22:00.560
Hazen, where are you going?

22:04.125 --> 22:05.839
Just let me help you up.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.733
- Oh my God.
- Ah! Goddammit!

22:18.209 --> 22:20.876
Okay. Let's go.

22:26.142 --> 22:27.520
This is hurting my ass.

23:02.149 --> 23:04.681
- Who are they?
- Terrowin's men.

23:05.766 --> 23:07.954
Well, let's not keep them waiting.

23:08.567 --> 23:09.910
Hazen, get off.

23:36.962 --> 23:38.296
Was is Terrowin that sent you?

23:38.376 --> 23:41.416
Or have you come on your own?
Answer me!

23:55.603 --> 23:57.494
Emeline! Get to Hazen!

24:09.518 --> 24:11.418
Dammit! We let one get away.

24:12.206 --> 24:13.632
Cowards. All of them.

24:14.264 --> 24:16.905
- I should track him down.
- We don't have time, it's getting late.

24:16.967 --> 24:19.407
- And he's already halfway back to Terrowin.
- Who's Terrowin?

24:22.723 --> 24:23.898
My fathers brother.

24:24.110 --> 24:27.052
A ruthless man who has the blood
of our people on his hands.

24:27.483 --> 24:28.173
What did he do?

24:28.394 --> 24:30.612
Five years ago
in the dark night of winter,

24:31.159 --> 24:34.707
he stole into our parents' bedchamber
and murdered our mother.

24:35.647 --> 24:38.351
We heard the scream.
Arabella ran in...

24:38.979 --> 24:41.435
and saw him slit her throat,
like an animal.

24:43.714 --> 24:45.912
For this, he will pay with his life.

24:46.164 --> 24:49.134
Our father fought during bravely,
but was killed.

24:49.911 --> 24:52.767
By morning more than half
of our people were dead.

24:53.316 --> 24:55.127
Uncle Tybalt tried to fight back, but...

24:55.366 --> 24:57.080
Terrowin ransacked the castle and...

24:57.160 --> 24:58.503
we were forced to flee.

26:03.622 --> 26:04.797
Ulric.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.005
We have brought a stranger.

26:15.882 --> 26:17.013
It's a magical potion.

26:18.056 --> 26:19.258
No, it's a chicken soup.

26:20.459 --> 26:21.697
Even a Shaman must eat.

26:24.032 --> 26:24.695
Hungry?

26:30.630 --> 26:31.346
Who are you?

26:32.309 --> 26:33.020
Who am I?

26:34.133 --> 26:35.078
Hazen Kaine.

26:35.324 --> 26:37.003
You're not from these pads,
Hazen Kaine.

26:38.444 --> 26:39.858
How did you find yourself here?

26:41.318 --> 26:43.218
- You tell me.
- I'll tell you when you tell me.

26:43.660 --> 26:44.570
Come down here.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.439
Be careful. Slippery.

27:05.874 --> 27:06.758
The marking.

27:07.624 --> 27:09.304
What is it with you people and the tattoo?

27:09.433 --> 27:12.555
This marking is given out to those
with intuitive gifts.

27:12.868 --> 27:14.432
Very few warriors
have this ability.

27:15.948 --> 27:16.797
What ability is that?

27:16.973 --> 27:18.723
To see into the lives of those...

27:18.803 --> 27:20.782
who are intertwined
with his own destiny.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.053
Now follow me.

27:25.696 --> 27:26.253
Come on.

27:27.402 --> 27:28.992
Come along. Follow me, Hazen.

27:41.466 --> 27:42.173
Have a seat.

27:45.365 --> 27:47.071
That's my chair.
Your chair is over there.

27:55.334 --> 27:56.226
Give me your hands.

28:01.235 --> 28:02.945
I want you to close your eyes...

28:04.289 --> 28:07.097
and tell me exactly what happened
before you arrived here.

28:07.357 --> 28:09.454
Man, I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

28:09.618 --> 28:12.180
Hazen?
I'm trying to help you here, okay?

28:12.994 --> 28:13.921
Close your eyes.

28:20.250 --> 28:22.218
I put some kids into a container.

28:22.308 --> 28:24.687
One of the girls had a gold medallion.

28:24.941 --> 28:27.956
I took it from her, locked the container
and moved to my car,

28:28.080 --> 28:29.368
The medallion.

28:29.497 --> 28:32.604
Which had similar symbols
as my tattoo.

28:32.684 --> 28:36.902
Some kind of portal opened
and sucked me into it.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.985
Everything went black
and when I woke up,

28:39.242 --> 28:40.735
I found myself in the forest.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.664
- And here I am.
- Who are these children?

28:44.753 --> 28:46.074
- It was just a job.
- Just a job?

28:46.280 --> 28:48.232
That is no job
for the man carrying the mark.

28:48.634 --> 28:50.971
Maybe you have a job
to do here Hazen.

28:51.274 --> 28:54.066
- We're all connected some way.
- I'm not connected to you people.

28:54.146 --> 28:56.336
You are on a path that you must
follow to it's end.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.740
And that end might come sooner
than you think.

29:01.765 --> 29:03.745
- He will lead us in battle.
- The hell I will!

29:03.825 --> 29:07.403
- Hell is also closer than you think, Hazen.
- Look, I wanna get out of here.

29:07.483 --> 29:08.518
Are you going to help me or not?

29:08.598 --> 29:11.716
- But the marking speaks of your destiny here.
- Damn the marking!

29:11.796 --> 29:13.657
- We need your help!
- It ain't my fight!

29:13.737 --> 29:15.555
- Please, Hazen!
- You know, he's right.

29:16.301 --> 29:17.317
We don't need him.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.233
This man cares solely for himself.

29:19.661 --> 29:22.206
He's vile, selfish and speaks
like a coward.

29:23.398 --> 29:25.414
- I pity your children.
- They are not my children.

29:25.776 --> 29:26.819
Then they are lucky.

29:27.865 --> 29:31.682
If you want to reach home,
you must follow the path of courage.

29:32.867 --> 29:34.997
And when the time is right
it will lead you home.

29:42.169 --> 29:43.786
Your time is now, Hazen.

30:05.496 --> 30:08.736
You cans stay here, or come with us.
I really don't care.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.930
My sister is quick to anger.

30:19.142 --> 30:22.703
But you must understand,
things have not been easy for her.

30:23.283 --> 30:26.662
She blames herself
for Terrowin's assault on our kingdom.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.622
- What happened?
- Terrowin wanted her hand in marriage,

30:29.702 --> 30:30.862
but she loathes him,

30:31.383 --> 30:33.919
and our father
would not force her to marry.

30:34.378 --> 30:35.730
Terrowin was enraged.

30:36.059 --> 30:38.029
Everything fell apart after that.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.745
You are foolish to make
an enemy of her, Hazen.

30:57.251 --> 30:59.240
You must prove to her
that you are worthy.

31:00.574 --> 31:02.447
Worthy? Worthy of what?

31:04.002 --> 31:06.167
Foolish man.
Come on. Get on the horse.

31:20.936 --> 31:22.938
Move along. Let's go.

31:23.475 --> 31:25.339
Move! Move!

31:26.032 --> 31:27.251
Come on!

31:56.729 --> 31:57.824
Your majesty.

32:06.844 --> 32:07.975
Why have you disturbed me?

32:08.258 --> 32:10.184
I... I saw the princesses.

32:10.393 --> 32:13.248
They were in the forest
accompanied by another rider.

32:15.464 --> 32:16.683
Did you shackle them?

32:17.624 --> 32:21.114
No, your majesty.
They fight like demons.

32:21.653 --> 32:23.457
I barely escaped with my life.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.640
You let the Princess best you?

32:28.269 --> 32:29.249
It's alright.

32:30.672 --> 32:31.865
It's alright.

32:34.046 --> 32:38.659
Embrace me soldier.
I will ease your pain.

32:47.981 --> 32:49.960
Assemble my army at once.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.089
It is time to end this.

32:56.321 --> 32:59.608
And bring Princess Arabella
to me. Alive!

34:23.920 --> 34:25.440
Let's run into the forest!

35:16.091 --> 35:18.724
- So Terrowin has attacked Ulric.
- We believe so.

35:20.748 --> 35:22.940
- Uncle Tybal.
- My dear.

35:24.779 --> 35:26.723
Everyone is speaking of this man.

35:27.014 --> 35:28.896
I have come to see him
for myself.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.256
Uncle, this is Hazen Kaine.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.991
He comes to us from a time
far away.

35:35.270 --> 35:36.781
Give me your right hand.

35:38.276 --> 35:40.458
- Here you go.
- The rumors are true.

35:40.812 --> 35:42.572
<i>The mark of a great warrior.</i>

35:43.976 --> 35:44.939
So I'm told.

35:45.989 --> 35:48.127
You have been sent by
the heavens...

35:48.207 --> 35:51.273
to help save our people
from Terrowin's brutal reign.

35:51.353 --> 35:54.284
He has a powerful weapon, Uncle.
He called it: Gun right?

35:54.593 --> 35:55.929
The gun is out of bullets.

35:56.161 --> 35:59.475
- Then you must make some more.
- I cannot make more bullets here.

36:00.732 --> 36:02.225
We have a decision to make.

36:02.305 --> 36:04.357
Ulrick spoke of your medallion.

36:04.437 --> 36:07.410
A magical medallion
we believe Terrowin possess too.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.462
Maybe Terrowin carries your fate.

36:12.281 --> 36:13.792
I will leave you to rest.

37:49.608 --> 37:50.678
You should be sleeping.

37:53.420 --> 37:54.460
You don't like me, do you?

37:55.828 --> 37:57.021
- No.
- I don't blame you.

37:58.418 --> 37:59.867
I'm a selfish son of a bitch.

38:00.795 --> 38:03.595
Of course it's like where I come from,
every man and woman for himself.

38:03.839 --> 38:05.006
This is not what I believe.

38:06.234 --> 38:08.620
Well... that's how it is where I live.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.385
Then I will not choose
to live in your world.

38:15.412 --> 38:17.462
Listen, I understand
what I need to do now.

38:17.656 --> 38:19.694
I need to defeat Terrowin
to get the medallion...

38:19.774 --> 38:22.213
so I can go home and you won't
have to worry about Terrowin anymore.

38:22.439 --> 38:23.332
We can work together.

38:24.728 --> 38:27.963
Look... you fight only for yourself,

38:29.440 --> 38:31.832
and you're not a skilled fighter.
Even if you think you are.

38:34.539 --> 38:35.039
Try me.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.291
Where the fuck are you guys
coming from?

41:23.552 --> 41:24.931
Help! Help!

41:31.216 --> 41:33.615
Take the kid! Get out of here now!

41:37.452 --> 41:39.890
Go! Go! Go!

41:51.111 --> 41:54.401
- You're outnumbered!
- I will not surrender.

41:54.603 --> 41:56.316
You will surrender. Let's go!

41:56.396 --> 41:58.009
Come on! Let's go

42:08.650 --> 42:10.152
Please, I need some water.

43:15.082 --> 43:16.037
Alright here.

43:41.243 --> 43:42.807
Olag, come.

43:45.049 --> 43:46.922
Please, we need some food.

43:54.232 --> 43:55.788
I haven't seen him.

44:07.847 --> 44:09.455
You. Lift me up.

44:21.752 --> 44:23.502
He's coming to kill us.

44:25.376 --> 44:26.825
I thought you said no.

44:28.144 --> 44:29.938
Children go. Go play...

44:31.336 --> 44:32.957
Looks like you made a friend.

44:35.093 --> 44:36.461
Where are their parents?

44:37.803 --> 44:39.601
They died in the first battle.

44:40.705 --> 44:42.844
The day Terrowin took over
the castle.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.601
They've been living
with their grandfather.

44:46.697 --> 44:48.172
They are orphans of war.

44:52.152 --> 44:55.518
Don't worry.
We take care of our people.

44:56.714 --> 44:57.925
We are all connected.

45:01.062 --> 45:01.997
So I see.

45:09.263 --> 45:10.761
We need some water.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.824
Why don't you two go to the river
and get some.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.756
Sister. Make yourself useful.

45:24.993 --> 45:25.859
Thank you.

45:46.131 --> 45:48.358
- Hey Tybalt, how are we doing?
- Ulric.

45:54.223 --> 45:56.220
- Is that all we have?
- Yep.

45:58.113 --> 46:00.033
- We'll need to go to the armory.
- You're right.

46:00.039 --> 46:02.151
We need every sword
to defend ourselves.

46:02.513 --> 46:05.264
Yes. But first we will eat.
Join me, Tybalt.

47:04.924 --> 47:05.958
You fought well today.

47:07.160 --> 47:09.121
Wasn't enough. Never is.

47:12.170 --> 47:13.389
What troubles you, Hazen?

47:13.787 --> 47:15.589
I see dark shadows on your face.

47:18.529 --> 47:19.563
Thinking about my wife.

47:23.110 --> 47:24.038
Tell me about her.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.636
She was the love of my life.

47:31.493 --> 47:32.810
And she's dead because of me.

47:34.622 --> 47:36.425
Because of the people
I associated with.

47:39.888 --> 47:40.816
I owed them money.

47:42.749 --> 47:45.218
I came home one afternoon
and my house was on fire...

47:45.298 --> 47:47.172
and I found my wife tied
to the bed.

47:49.539 --> 47:50.599
Burned alive.

47:51.895 --> 47:54.271
That kind of thing happens
to... to anyone,

47:56.813 --> 47:58.279
life becomes meaningless.

48:01.546 --> 48:02.368
I understand.

48:05.423 --> 48:08.586
Since the death of my mother...
I've felt so alone.

48:10.538 --> 48:12.773
The only thing
that keeps me going is Emeline.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.550
And the thought that one day,

48:15.630 --> 48:18.051
I will take revenge on the man
who destroyed my family.

48:20.978 --> 48:22.003
I will fight with you.

48:23.358 --> 48:24.436
I know you will.

48:30.494 --> 48:32.049
I've done some bad things in my life.

48:33.074 --> 48:34.011
Really bad.

48:36.516 --> 48:38.619
You may have made some bad
choices, Hazen,

48:39.759 --> 48:41.041
but you are not a bad man.

48:42.923 --> 48:43.904
I see that now.

49:38.175 --> 49:40.526
Soon there will be none of us left.

49:43.741 --> 49:45.782
Most of our fighters are dead.

49:48.569 --> 49:49.797
Terrowin is very powerful.

49:50.592 --> 49:51.944
But he will not destroy us.

49:53.726 --> 49:57.031
They say Hazen can.
He has not made us any safer.

49:58.668 --> 50:00.321
Are you certain he is the one?

50:01.045 --> 50:02.026
He has the mark.

50:03.018 --> 50:05.351
We must wait for Hazen
to accept his fate.

50:09.164 --> 50:09.844
Yeah.

50:27.838 --> 50:28.925
Your Majesty.

50:38.781 --> 50:41.786
We return victorious.
The village is in ashes.

50:42.313 --> 50:44.028
The ground is bloody with their bodies.

50:44.196 --> 50:45.997
They were no match for your arm,
your Majesty.

50:49.304 --> 50:51.496
- Where are the girls?
- The girls escaped.

50:51.973 --> 50:54.827
For the moment. But we have
scouts patrolling the forest.

50:54.986 --> 50:56.655
They will be found.
You can count on that.

51:04.471 --> 51:06.027
I give it till dawn.

51:07.228 --> 51:08.934
Do not disappoint me.

51:10.519 --> 51:11.562
Your Majesty.

51:29.093 --> 51:30.313
You are mine.

51:33.936 --> 51:36.993
I control you
and you will do my bidding.

52:06.204 --> 52:08.156
More of Terrowin's men
are sure to come.

52:08.236 --> 52:09.517
We already lost so many.

52:09.597 --> 52:11.175
We will defend those who are left.

52:15.841 --> 52:18.004
Look, I know it's
damn near impossible,

52:18.084 --> 52:21.201
you have fifteen, twenty soldiers.
You need to attack first.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.953
- Impossible.
- What do you mean it's impossible?

52:24.033 --> 52:26.666
It's not impossible.
If you want this, we can do this.

52:27.856 --> 52:30.012
What we need is stealth, surprise.

52:30.444 --> 52:32.317
No. There's not enough to do battle.

52:32.497 --> 52:34.801
- You have to attack first.
- I will not send my men...

52:34.866 --> 52:37.092
- to be slaughtered.
- You'd have them slaughtered here?

52:41.953 --> 52:44.205
He's right.
That may be our only chance.

52:44.285 --> 52:45.370
And we need to take it.

52:49.682 --> 52:52.789
If that's our decision, Hazen,
do you have a plan?

52:55.734 --> 52:56.282
Well...

52:57.979 --> 52:59.888
we need to get to Terrowin
to get rid of him.

53:00.074 --> 53:01.656
Get my medallion
and I can go home.

53:03.057 --> 53:04.737
We need to create some kind
of a diversion.

53:06.016 --> 53:09.237
Like us engaging Terrowin's army
outside of his castle...

53:09.317 --> 53:11.578
and me getting into it alone
with Terrowin.

53:14.285 --> 53:16.529
- I will come with you.
- Me too. - No.

53:16.850 --> 53:18.946
The castle was our home.
You need us.

53:19.565 --> 53:20.492
I will come too.

53:22.269 --> 53:24.646
Alright. We go tonight.

53:27.789 --> 53:30.970
If that is so,
we must gather our arms.

53:33.212 --> 53:35.192
Okay, take the troops
and head them to the armory.

53:35.863 --> 53:37.374
Emeline will stay here with me...

53:37.560 --> 53:39.793
so we can secure the camp
and round up more men.

53:40.509 --> 53:41.909
We will wait for you in the valley.

53:42.356 --> 53:44.123
Very well. Let's go.

53:45.884 --> 53:47.837
- Let's go!
- Get ready, get ready.

55:00.321 --> 55:01.620
Grab some weapons.

55:02.309 --> 55:05.499
Pick some thing that fits you
and then get around.

55:11.792 --> 55:12.720
Listen up!

55:15.372 --> 55:17.016
This is the sword of my father.

55:17.846 --> 55:19.393
The King's own sword.

55:21.686 --> 55:22.967
Now it's yours.

55:23.838 --> 55:25.959
May it protect and give you courage.

55:34.844 --> 55:35.719
Men!

55:37.534 --> 55:40.140
Tonight we move against the castle.

55:41.078 --> 55:43.482
We will take our last stand.

55:44.012 --> 55:45.664
And I will not lie to you,

55:46.256 --> 55:48.956
we are out numbered
and this sparrow is desperate.

55:50.723 --> 55:53.198
But we have a simple choice:

55:54.090 --> 56:00.709
- Either we fight or await our DOOM!!
- Fight!

56:01.978 --> 56:04.275
Perhaps with the element
of surprise...

56:05.415 --> 56:08.428
and with the help of our friend,
Hazen Kaine,

56:09.370 --> 56:11.676
who bears the Royal marking,

56:13.638 --> 56:15.520
we will prevail.

56:17.192 --> 56:20.160
This battle is for our children...

56:21.012 --> 56:22.726
and our grandchildren.

56:24.600 --> 56:30.017
Men, we need to meet the honor
of fighting for all that is OURS!!

56:31.204 --> 56:33.843
- Yeah!
- Ready! Let's go!

56:41.191 --> 56:42.339
We're all gonna die.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.691
Hazen, happy to see you.

57:16.464 --> 57:18.585
We need to take our men
and head west to the forest.

57:20.641 --> 57:21.663
Where's west?

57:22.578 --> 57:24.381
I'm guessing towards the castle.

57:26.423 --> 57:27.766
Some Shaman you are.

57:43.926 --> 57:45.653
- Hey-yaw.
- Yaw.

58:46.817 --> 58:48.390
ARCHERS!!

01:01:30.925 --> 01:01:33.054
I will enjoy watching you suffer,

01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:35.467
as I did your mother
all those years ago.

01:01:35.713 --> 01:01:37.073
Remember?

01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.903
You stood by
and watched that man you call King,

01:01:40.003 --> 01:01:41.343
took my family from me.

01:01:41.423 --> 01:01:42.430
You deserve to die!

01:02:47.548 --> 01:02:48.450
Terrowin!

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:04.755
You naive child.

01:03:04.984 --> 01:03:07.118
You think it's that easy
to attack me?

01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:24.427
STOP FIGHTING!!

01:03:32.769 --> 01:03:35.782
Terrowin, not hiding in your castle.

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:38.760
You call yourself a leader.

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:41.903
You stand in the shallows
of our kingdom...

01:03:43.024 --> 01:03:45.401
while your minions do thy bidding.

01:03:46.388 --> 01:03:49.733
You have no right
to call yourself a leader.

01:03:52.901 --> 01:03:53.987
Well done, brother.

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:57.832
I've been waiting
for this moment so long.

01:03:59.212 --> 01:04:02.463
It must take a great deal
of courage to face me now.

01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:08.974
Courage... you know nothing about courage.

01:04:09.607 --> 01:04:15.280
You betrayed our kingdom
and family the day you killed Cardem.

01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:16.385
Betrayal?

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.635
What do you know about betrayal?

01:04:19.766 --> 01:04:21.769
I've been through this all my life!

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.568
I've been betrayed by love!

01:04:23.648 --> 01:04:26.151
So don't you talk to me
about betrayal!

01:04:29.643 --> 01:04:31.949
Arabella! Look at me.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.754
Ride with me.

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:36.123
She will never.

01:04:47.141 --> 01:04:50.790
And you, you must be the warrior
they all talk about.

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:54.892
- You've come to kill me.
- Yup.

01:04:57.173 --> 01:04:58.684
They all come to kill me.

01:04:59.108 --> 01:05:01.706
Is that right?
Well, I know guys like you.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.581
This time it's going to end differently.

01:05:10.094 --> 01:05:12.515
Terrowin,
there is only one way to end this.

01:05:12.745 --> 01:05:15.829
With a duel in the name
of our true king, Cardem,

01:05:16.565 --> 01:05:19.896
you will fight to the death
against the marked warrior.

01:05:20.391 --> 01:05:22.636
Do you accept the challenge,
Terrowin?

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.168
I accept, Tybalt!

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:27.481
I'm out of time, warrior.

01:07:22.433 --> 01:07:25.667
Arabella.
We need to get to Terrowin. Now.

01:07:32.347 --> 01:07:33.257
Getting better.

01:07:42.593 --> 01:07:43.645
Good Luck!

01:07:48.825 --> 01:07:51.132
Don't worry.
I know they will succeed.

01:09:18.142 --> 01:09:20.121
Terrowin. Let's finish this.

01:09:20.201 --> 01:09:21.523
As you wish.

01:10:06.209 --> 01:10:07.199
Arabella.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.925
Come on, get up. It's okay.

01:10:13.128 --> 01:10:15.593
Terrowin's dead. It's over now.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.425
Hazen.

01:10:22.023 --> 01:10:25.390
You have to go.
You must save the children.

01:11:23.063 --> 01:11:24.671
Oh my god!

01:12:04.841 --> 01:12:06.423
Drive! Now!

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:12.805
Take a right!

01:12:16.247 --> 01:12:18.226
Go! Go! Lose it!

01:13:03.191 --> 01:13:04.579
Do you see the fucker?

01:13:12.016 --> 01:13:13.784
Shit! Move!

01:13:37.043 --> 01:13:39.809
Ana, go get the kids out, honey.

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:02.680
Thanks for the shirt.

01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:39.621
It's stuck!

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.286
Something is now right.
Look around.

01:15:55.756 --> 01:15:58.080
Ana! Get it open now!

01:16:01.747 --> 01:16:02.833
Go!

01:17:07.473 --> 01:17:08.259
I got it!

01:17:13.569 --> 01:17:14.382
Out!

01:17:16.309 --> 01:17:18.288
Go! Go-go!

01:17:28.932 --> 01:17:31.261
Where the fuck have you been?
You had a job to do!

01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:32.909
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

01:17:36.314 --> 01:17:37.312
Let the kids go.

01:17:39.053 --> 01:17:40.043
Fuck you!

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:42.322
Your last words.

01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:13.783
Stay there, motherfucker!..

01:18:21.884 --> 01:18:23.793
Girls, run! Now!

01:18:25.692 --> 01:18:26.628
Ffuuck!

01:18:34.236 --> 01:18:35.562
Are you going to shoot me now?

01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:37.904
After all these years
we've spent together?

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.072
And now you have a guilty conscience.

01:18:40.796 --> 01:18:43.483
I trusted you!
You are like a brother to me.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.294
And now, you wanna shoot me?

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.194
Things change.

01:18:49.706 --> 01:18:51.388
But people like you never do.

01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:12.931
Girls?

01:19:15.961 --> 01:19:16.933
This belongs to you.

01:19:18.436 --> 01:19:21.224
You're right. It is magical.
Let's go home.

01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:39.973
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Daddy! Hey!

01:20:40.053 --> 01:20:41.431
I'm so happy to see you, daddy.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.989
That's good. I love you.

01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:44.986
I missed you
and I was so worried about you.

01:20:46.066 --> 01:20:48.933
It's okay Anatoly,
it's okay! Lower your gun.

01:20:49.013 --> 01:20:51.461
This is no way to treat the man
that returns my children.

01:20:53.185 --> 01:20:54.917
- I'll see you inside, girls.

01:20:59.641 --> 01:21:01.823
Sir, I understand
if you wanna press charges.

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:05.234
What's done is done.
You're free to go.

01:21:07.323 --> 01:21:08.030
Thank you.

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:12.860
I appreciate it.
