[instrumental music]

00:05.213 --> 00:06.965
Okay, I have been
pounding the pavement

00:07.048 --> 00:09.050
handing out resumes
all over town.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.594
I just don't understand
why I haven't found a job yet.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.138
Well, Tina,
why didn't you ask me?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.056
They're always looking for
new people at my office.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.808
I don't know, I mean,
you know that I was fired

00:16.891 --> 00:19.102
from my last three jobs
and most recently was let go

00:19.185 --> 00:21.104
because I fell in love
with my married boss.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.522
Well, yeah, honey,
that's the stuff

00:22.605 --> 00:24.524
we leave off the resume.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.570
Tina, why am I down
here as a reference?

00:28.653 --> 00:30.196
Uh, because you own a Gap

00:30.280 --> 00:32.949
and I was your top salesperson
three Christmases in a row.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.705
Okay, here you go.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.206
- Tips are appreciated.
- Oh!

00:40.290 --> 00:41.958
And I appreciate
that you're my sister

00:42.041 --> 00:44.294
and I don't have to.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.754
Don't worry.
I'll be able to tip soon.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
- Holly's getting me a job.
- Oh, yeah.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.966
We're gonna be working together
just like you and Lauren.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.677
Oh, that's great! You guys are
gonna love working together.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.096
Well, it was a little rocky for
me and Lauren in the beginning

00:55.180 --> 00:58.099
and that time she ran
my old business into the ground.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.809
'But I couldn't do
without her now.'

00:59.893 --> 01:01.603
I mean, she's so fun and warm

01:01.686 --> 01:03.646
and the customers
just think she's great.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.566
Alright, look, geezer!

01:06.649 --> 01:08.818
Uh, I got to go.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.445
Uh, yeah, Lauren,
I'll take care of it.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.990
Hi there, sir.
Good to see you again.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.450
Can I help you?

01:15.533 --> 01:17.619
Your coffee tastes like ass.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.997
Well, we tried a new blend.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.208
Perhaps it's the chicory
you're tasting.

01:24.459 --> 01:27.670
Just ass, that's all. Just ass.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.672
Cold ass.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.174
Okay, well, uh

01:31.257 --> 01:34.594
maybe a complimentary cupcake
will make it up to you.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.972
Not when they taste like feet.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.974
Alright, that's it.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.726
Now, you listen here, mister.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.187
Every day you come in here
with that sour puss

01:44.270 --> 01:45.688
and you tell me
what's wrong with my business.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.399
Well, my cupcakes are delicious.
And my coffee's hot.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.943
Now, if you don't like it,
you can leave!

01:50.026 --> 01:51.361
Otherwise, you just sit there

01:51.444 --> 01:53.822
and you eat your feet
and drink your ass!

01:56.407 --> 01:59.911
You see, that is why it is good
to work with a friend.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.539
We support each other.
We tag-team, you know?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.541
Lauren and I
are in this together.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.501
Uh, he, he dead.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.295
What?

02:10.380 --> 02:11.756
Val did it! She killed him!

02:56.676 --> 02:58.303
What did I do? What did I do?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.722
Val, you didn't do anything!

03:00.805 --> 03:03.641
Oh, Lord, a dead man
just rolled out the bakery!

03:06.853 --> 03:10.273
Oh, God, why did I yell
at him? I killed him.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.192
Val, would you stop it?
It's not your fault.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.195
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I'm late for a meeting.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.906
Would you kill me if I went?

03:17.989 --> 03:21.159
You've seen what
she's capable of.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.286
No, go. I'll be fine.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.623
Damn! My cell phone's dying too.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.459
Boy, I tell you, when it rains..

03:29.542 --> 03:31.628
Oh, I wonder how old he was.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.046
And I wonder if he had a family.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.465
A wife, a little dog.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.258
Oh, don't go starting
with the guilt.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.552
It is a wasted emotion.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.013
Said the girl eating
the dead man's cupcake.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.934
Don't worry. I'm eating
from the other side.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.144
Hmm, which is ironic

03:48.227 --> 03:50.355
because that's where he is now.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.652
What, Lauren, how could
you be so cold?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.612
The poor man just died
right in front of us.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.615
Well, did you ever think
that maybe I'm just in shock

04:00.698 --> 04:04.619
that maybe this is how
I deal with death?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.204
I'm sorry.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.914
Is that true?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.248
Okay.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.709
I can't believe I yelled at him.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.211
Why didn't I just
give him the coffee?

04:13.294 --> 04:16.172
Why did I have to go
with the chicory? Oh, God!

04:16.255 --> 04:18.298
She is such a drama queen.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.176
You'd think somebody
just dropped..

04:20.259 --> 04:21.511
Oh, yeah.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.723
What are we gonna do
with the dead man's jacket?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.434
It lo-looks so empty
without the dead man in it.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.522
Lauren, for God's sakes,
let this one be on the house.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.483
Oh, I'm just looking
for some identification

04:35.566 --> 04:38.277
so I can get this
back to his family.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.904
Look, how sad.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.407
That must be a picture
of his three sons.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.243
His three handsome sons.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.413
Oh, Val..

04:48.496 --> 04:50.999
I am so sorry. I was wrong.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.709
We should feel guilty.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.752
Yes, we must go to that funeral

04:54.836 --> 04:58.673
and purge ourselves
of all this guilt.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.342
Yes, yes, that's
what we should do.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.593
We should go to the funeral.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.637
Yes, but first we need
to go shopping

05:04.721 --> 05:05.847
and pick up something in black

05:05.930 --> 05:08.016
that shows off a little cleave.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.360
Holly, thank you so much
for helping me get this job.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.070
I really appreciate
it and I promise

05:21.154 --> 05:22.071
you I will not let you down.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.364
Are you kidding me?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.616
You already
make the best coffee ever.

Hey, Tyler.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.584
Oh, hey, Dave. Oh, this is Tina.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.586
She's the new office assistant.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.920
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.756
Just in for my morning
cheese doodles.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.632
Oh, oh, let me get that for you.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.052
- Here you go.
- That was fast.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.762
She's good.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.430
Hey, are you pitching
any promotional ideas

05:47.513 --> 05:48.890
for Gwen Stefani's new single?

05:48.973 --> 05:50.641
'I heard whoever comes up
with the best idea'

05:50.725 --> 05:52.852
is gonna get to work
on her team.

05:52.935 --> 05:56.022
Oh, my God, Gwen Stefani?
Holly, that is so awesome!

05:56.105 --> 05:59.108
- I hope you get it.
- This has been opened.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.485
Do you know how many people
have had their gross

06:00.568 --> 06:03.321
boogery fingers in here?

06:03.404 --> 06:06.616
I can't snack on cootie doodles.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.702
She's not as good as I thought.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.621
Sorry.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.623
Oh, my God, I've only
been here a half hour

06:13.706 --> 06:15.792
and I've already screwed up.
Holly, I am so sorry.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.919
Okay, will you relax?
You didn't do anything wrong.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.129
Oh, God, I'm so stupid.
Why didn't I think?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.339
Okay, will you stop it?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.425
I mean, it is just
cheese doodles.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.302
Now calm down,
and I'm gonna think about

06:26.385 --> 06:28.513
some ideas for Gwen Stefani.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.977
Hey, you know what?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.938
Why don't you think
of some ideas too?

06:37.021 --> 06:38.439
- Me?
- Yeah. I'm serious.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.024
You should go for it too.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.360
No, Holly, I appreciate it,
but don't you want it too?

06:42.443 --> 06:45.696
Well, yeah, but if you
get it, then I can brag

06:45.780 --> 06:47.782
that I brought
my smart friend on board.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.826
It's a win-win.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.410
Okay. Cool.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.246
I'm gonna think of some ideas
while I make more coffee.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.665
No!

06:55.748 --> 06:58.793
'Cause who really drinks
coffee in the mornings?

07:01.879 --> 07:04.924
[instrumental music]

07:11.973 --> 07:14.517
Well, you must be
one of the sons.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.353
Oh, you're taller in person.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.856
- Do I know you?
- You do now, I'm Lauren.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.400
- I'm Andy.
- Hi, I'm Val, uh..

07:22.483 --> 07:24.861
From the bakery
where your father..

07:24.944 --> 07:27.363
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, so am I.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.532
- Are you married?
- No.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.493
Oh, it must be so much
harder to face this alone.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.873
You know, my dad always
talked about that bakery.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.709
He said going there was
the high point of his day.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.086
You're kidding.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.046
I mean, I know.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.549
In fact, he kept
telling me to stop by

07:46.632 --> 07:48.426
because he knew I'd love it too.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.552
I was always too busy.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.512
Oh, why? Are you a doctor?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.931
- Plastic surgeon.
- Blackjack!

07:57.685 --> 07:59.187
You know, I don't think
my dad was sending me there

07:59.270 --> 08:00.563
for the cupcakes.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.732
He kept telling me
I had to meet the girl

08:02.815 --> 08:04.066
who served him the cupcakes.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.526
Oh! Well, that was me.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.529
And-and I can't wait to tell you
all of the conversations

08:08.613 --> 08:09.989
I had with your father.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.533
Andy, uh, there's something
I need to tell you.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.076
No, no, no. No, you don't.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.871
Uh, no, Val was nothing
but kind and warm and sweet

08:16.954 --> 08:18.122
and loving to your father.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.541
No, I have to say this.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.710
Andy, I feel responsible.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.421
Uh, you father passed away
in my bakery.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.882
Oh, you're-you're the owner.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.300
You're the one
he wanted me to meet.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.761
Wait, well, how do you
know he said owner?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.596
He was old, and he slurred.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.515
"Owner." "Lauren."
They're like exactly alike.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.437
Val, you know what my dad
would have liked?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.148
For you and me to have
dinner together sometime.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.317
She killed your father!

Holly, thank you so much
for convincing me

08:53.115 --> 08:54.575
to pitch my ideas to the boss.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.202
Oh, my God, I am
so glad that you did.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.453
I mean, it's such
a good experience

08:57.536 --> 08:58.621
even if you don't get the job.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.165
I got it!

09:01.249 --> 09:02.750
What? Are you kidding me?

09:02.833 --> 09:06.170
Your first day here
and you're on Team Stefani?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.797
Oh, I know what you're
thinking now I'm gonna be

09:07.880 --> 09:09.924
too busy to make the coffee
but don't you worry.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.384
I will find the time.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.052
Here's hopin'.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.637
Oh, hey, so let me
get this straight.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.223
I told you you could do
it, and you did it.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.516
Oh, my God, so what
was your idea?

09:18.599 --> 09:19.642
Oh, God, get this!

09:19.725 --> 09:21.686
I didn't even have
to pitch him an idea.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.105
He said he liked my enthusiasm.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.817
Are you sure
he didn't say nipples?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.698
Tina, um, just out of curiosity

09:33.781 --> 09:35.825
did uh, you wear your jacket
into the meeting?

09:35.908 --> 09:37.952
- No. Why?
- Because, um..

09:38.035 --> 09:40.079
I-I don't think
that you got the job.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.206
Your knockers did!

09:43.666 --> 09:47.128
Well, they're attached
to me, so, thank you.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.549
You knew how guilty I felt.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.175
Are you that
desperate to meet a man

09:53.259 --> 09:55.094
that you would tell the son
that I killed his father?

09:55.177 --> 09:58.556
Oh, I was making conversation.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.391
If Andy knew that
you went to that funeral

10:00.474 --> 10:02.518
just to hit on him,
he would never date you.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.563
Oh, why do you think
I didn't tell him?

10:05.646 --> 10:08.149
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.693
You're just jealous,
because after I told Andy

10:10.776 --> 10:13.738
that you killed his father
he was totally into me.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.742
- Are you insane?
- What is the matter with you?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.369
I want to meet a man.
So, kill me!

10:20.453 --> 10:22.538
That's just a figure of speech.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.293
Okay, I mean, I know
that you dress all

10:27.376 --> 10:29.337
you know, nakedy when we go out

10:29.420 --> 10:32.214
but, okay, you know, it's kind
of inappropriate for work.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.008
Hey, did I not get the job?

10:34.091 --> 10:37.386
The three of you got the job!

10:37.470 --> 10:41.515
I mean, do you not care
that you got it that way?

10:41.599 --> 10:43.351
Guys?

10:43.434 --> 10:46.145
Stop talking to your boobs!

10:46.228 --> 10:48.064
Ew! Do you not see
how wrong this is?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.982
What? Using what you
have to get ahead?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.233
Welcome to the real
world, Holly.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.110
Okay, yeah, well,
that's not my world.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.237
I mean, I get a job
because of my talent

10:55.321 --> 10:56.781
my brains, my ideas.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.657
So, do I,
I mean, if I didn't have

10:58.741 --> 10:59.992
the idea to take off my jacket

11:00.076 --> 11:02.536
I would still be
an assistant right now.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.832
Oh, my God, I cannot believe

11:06.916 --> 11:09.377
that I am actually friends
with someone like you.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.628
What?

11:10.711 --> 11:12.088
I cannot believe

11:12.171 --> 11:16.384
that I am actually friends
with someone like you!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.386
Fine, fine, okay,
if that's the way you feel

11:18.469 --> 11:19.804
then we are no longer friends.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.514
If I need to discuss
anything about work

11:21.597 --> 11:22.890
I'll have
my assistant call your..

11:22.973 --> 11:25.518
Oh, oh, wait!
You don't have an assistant.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.478
Oh, oh, I know,
maybe you can get your ideas

11:27.561 --> 11:28.938
to answer your phone.

11:29.021 --> 11:32.024
Well, at least
my ideas are even!

11:32.108 --> 11:33.401
[gasping]

11:43.202 --> 11:45.329
You know what?
We don't need Lauren and Tina.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.456
All I need is you and this couch

11:47.540 --> 11:51.293
and this ice cream
and these peanut butter cups.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.586
Oh, God.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.464
Look what those bad girls
have done to us.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.383
I cannot believe Tina!

11:57.466 --> 11:59.552
I mean, I am not gonna
be friends with somebody

11:59.635 --> 12:01.929
who, you know,
flashes their goods

12:02.012 --> 12:03.681
just to get what they want.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.641
I mean, yeah, it's helpful

12:05.724 --> 12:06.809
when you want to get into clubs

12:06.892 --> 12:09.645
but other than that, I'm out!

12:09.728 --> 12:10.646
Yeah, how about Lauren?

12:10.729 --> 12:11.772
She's so desperate to meet a guy

12:11.856 --> 12:13.315
she doesn't care who she hurts.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.444
Which is also helpful
for clubs, but I hate clubs.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.654
Oh, "Gilligan's Island."

12:18.737 --> 12:20.698
Oh, that always
makes us feel better.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.824
Mm-hmm.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.452
Okay, you know what
I never figured out?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.120
Why would a big
movie star like Ginger

12:26.203 --> 12:29.206
go on a three-hour tour
with a bunch of nobodies?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.834
This is my favorite one.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.627
It's the one where they almost
get off the island but don't.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.962
Oh.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.681
(man on TV)
'Mary Ann?
Mary Ann, where are you?'

12:45.764 --> 12:47.475
In here, professor.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.939
- What happened?
- I know, I know.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.902
I fell asleep out by the lagoon.
Got a little sunburn.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.528
But I have some exciting
island news to tell you.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.157
- Do you?
- What's going on?

13:03.240 --> 13:06.494
Little Buddy and I heard there's
some exciting island news.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.248
Yeah, did another Russian
cosmonaut land on the island

13:11.332 --> 13:13.042
and leave without us?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.881
Hello, darlings.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.216
What's all the commotion?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.051
Thurston and I were
in the middle of pitching wood

13:22.134 --> 13:25.012
and I have to get back before
he realizes I'm not there.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.974
What's going on?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.813
I came as soon as I got
into my push-up coconuts.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.235
Okay, everyone, I know it's
taken 12 years but I finally

13:39.318 --> 13:41.529
constructed a raft that will
transport us off the island.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.988
- Oh, yay!
- Yay!

13:43.072 --> 13:45.866
Unfortunately, because
of the size of the raft

13:45.950 --> 13:47.451
we're going to have to
leave one of us behind.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.869
- Boo!
- Boo!

13:48.953 --> 13:52.957
Now, I'm going because,
well, I built it.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.375
And Gilligan
and the skipper are going

13:54.458 --> 13:56.001
because of their
navigation skills.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.128
And Thurston and I
are going because we're going

13:58.212 --> 14:01.257
to give the professor
a lot of money.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.217
That leaves Mary Ann and Ginger.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.970
So, gals, why don't you
each tell us why you think

14:06.053 --> 14:08.055
you should go?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.224
Okay.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.727
I am an excellent rower,
and I'm also--

14:13.811 --> 14:15.854
I'll be wearing this.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.614
- Ginger, it is!
- Alright!

14:25.698 --> 14:27.116
Wait.

14:27.199 --> 14:31.662
Oh, but that is so unfair!

14:31.745 --> 14:33.581
Dear, dear Mary Ann

14:33.664 --> 14:36.292
we will miss you.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.128
But I have been working
my tail off for 12 years

14:39.211 --> 14:41.422
baking pies, doing their laundry

14:41.505 --> 14:43.632
being "Ann, the rest, and.."

14:43.716 --> 14:45.884
Well, all Ginger has to do is..

14:45.968 --> 14:47.803
Shake her ta-tas?

14:47.886 --> 14:52.266
Exactly. Oh, well,
I could just spit.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.813
Dear Mary Ann, we've all had
a Ginger in our lives.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.398
In my case, her name was Lauren

14:59.481 --> 15:02.860
my best friend,
a real good-time gal.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.695
- What?
- A harlot.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.530
- Huh?
- A ho, dear.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.990
Oh.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.075
Gee, I don't know.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.245
Maybe Ginger
isn't so wrong, after all.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.497
Maybe that is the way
to get what you want.

15:15.581 --> 15:19.710
But how would you feel about
yourself if you did that, dear?

15:19.793 --> 15:23.631
- Bad?
- Ping, ping, ping, angel.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.383
You see, Ginger knows
why they picked her

15:26.467 --> 15:28.344
and she has to live with that.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.262
Eventually, gravity
will catch up with her

15:30.346 --> 15:32.431
and all she'll be left with
is a low self-esteem

15:32.514 --> 15:34.642
and even lower coconuts.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.936
Holy cow!

15:38.020 --> 15:40.189
Here I was
feeling all bad for me

15:40.272 --> 15:41.857
because I'm gonna be all alone

15:41.940 --> 15:45.569
unless the Harlem Globetrotters
come back, they were nice.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.906
But I should really be
feeling bad for poor Ginger.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.201
She's so insecure and has
even lower self-esteem.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.577
Exactly.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.704
What she needs is a friend
who understands that

15:55.788 --> 15:58.374
and helps encourage her to
develop areas other than her--

15:58.457 --> 16:00.709
- Mrs. Howell, we're leaving.
- Ta-ta.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.555
Oh, my God.
I have been such a jerk.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.892
Me too. Lauren and Tina
just have low self-esteem.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.686
They are not the bad girls.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.729
We are.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.147
God, I love this show.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.401
I mean, we always
learn something.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.236
You know what we have to do,
we have to pass along

16:27.319 --> 16:29.154
Mrs. Howell's words
of wisdom to our friends.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.990
No, we can't tell them that
they have low self-esteem.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.742
I mean, that's hurtful.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.704
Talking about their innards.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.789
I can't believe
I've been so insensitive.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.165
Oh..

16:40.249 --> 16:43.419
So, do you really think that
Mrs. Howell would tell them?

16:43.502 --> 16:44.545
Yes.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.547
Okay, then that's what we'll do.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.091
And I think that
they'll be happy that we did.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.593
- Low self-esteem!
- Low self-esteem!

16:51.677 --> 16:54.138
I know that it's not
the easiest thing to hear

16:54.221 --> 16:56.432
but, you know, it's also not
the easiest thing to say.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.768
Oh, I don't know. It seemed
to slip right off your tongue.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.937
Oh, excuse me, but would a girl

17:02.020 --> 17:05.065
with low self-esteem wear this?

17:05.148 --> 17:06.983
I think that's kinda
why you wear it.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.777
Oh, that is so not true!

17:08.861 --> 17:11.446
I do not have a problem
with low self-esteem.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.615
Do I?

17:13.699 --> 17:14.950
A little bit.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.535
Which is why I think you feel

17:16.617 --> 17:17.994
you have to
throw yourself at men.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.289
You mean it's not just
because I'm horny?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.126
No, it's because

17:24.209 --> 17:27.463
nobody's ever told you that
you're smart and talented.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.257
And you have
so much more to offer

17:30.340 --> 17:31.633
than just your body.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.469
I mean, I see
what a great person you are.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.847
You're sweet, you're fun,
you make me laugh all the time.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.307
I mean, when I have a problem

17:38.390 --> 17:40.184
you're the first person I go to.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.602
- I am?
- Yes.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.896
I mean, you always
have such good ideas.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.939
You have so much more
experience than I do.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.776
I mean, you've been around.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.904
Because I have low self-esteem?

17:53.614 --> 17:54.907
But that is over.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.825
You are so much more than that.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.660
And I'm going to show you
that you do not have

17:58.744 --> 18:01.246
to whore yourself out
at funerals anymore.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.583
What about weddings
and bar mitzvahs?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
Oh, sweetie,
you are such a good friend

18:08.128 --> 18:11.548
and I'm so sorry
I accused you of murder.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.301
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.346
You were feeling guilty, and I
knew that and I didn't care.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.183
But today, you made me see
what's really important.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.560
What?

18:23.644 --> 18:25.312
Oh, uh..

18:26.814 --> 18:28.816
Uh..

18:28.899 --> 18:32.528
That whenever you're feeling bad
about yourself just come to me

18:32.611 --> 18:34.279
and we'll talk
about it together.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.989
Yes! You and me!

18:36.073 --> 18:40.035
We'll work on my crappy
self-esteem together!

18:40.118 --> 18:42.579
Holly, you are so right.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.373
I'm worthless, I'm nothing!

18:44.456 --> 18:46.834
No! No! You're clever,
you're creative.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.545
You know more about
Gwen Stefani than she does!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.129
I want you to march
yourself right back

18:51.213 --> 18:52.965
into the boss's office,
just, you know

18:53.048 --> 18:54.341
in a turtleneck

18:54.424 --> 18:56.426
and I want you to pitch
your little heart out!

18:56.510 --> 18:59.513
- I can't!
- Yes, you can!

18:59.596 --> 19:02.307
No, I don't even
own a turtleneck!

19:02.391 --> 19:05.018
I hate this job! I don't even
want this stupid job!

19:05.102 --> 19:07.563
Oh! Ginger, come back!

19:15.112 --> 19:16.655
Holly, you did the right thing.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.408
Tina just needs some time
to digest what you told her.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.326
No, I shouldn't have
tried to change her.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.161
I mean, she was happier
when she was Ginger

19:23.245 --> 19:25.289
and I was Mary Ann.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.166
Yeah, but was she really happy?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.752
I mean, look at Lauren. She was
thrilled when I talked to her.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.546
[laughing]

19:34.006 --> 19:35.966
Okay, I'll be right back.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.509
- Uh, hi.
- Hi.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.262
Have I told you how smart
and talented you are?

19:40.345 --> 19:42.598
Thank you, and now
I'm just gonna serve

19:42.681 --> 19:44.933
this nice customer his cupcake.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.351
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.519
[giggles]

19:53.734 --> 19:54.943
- Hey.
- Tina.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.445
Oh, I've been
trying to call you.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.988
I was so worried about you.
Where have you been?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.324
Well, I thought about what
you said and I used my brain

20:00.407 --> 20:02.868
and I came up with some
really kick-ass ideas

20:02.951 --> 20:04.620
so I went into the boss
and I pitched them.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.788
Good for you. Did he like them?

20:06.872 --> 20:09.041
He said they were all lame!

20:09.124 --> 20:10.834
Yay! What?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.628
He didn't like one idea?

20:12.711 --> 20:15.047
Nope, not a one, but he
said I still had the job

20:15.130 --> 20:16.340
so you know what I did?

20:16.423 --> 20:18.675
I'm scared to ask.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.469
- I quit. Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.512
I don't want to get a job
because of my body.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.682
Good girl, oh, uh-oh.
So, what are you gonna do now?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.309
Well, you made me realize
that I am kinda good

20:27.392 --> 20:28.810
at a lot of stuff,
I'm just not sure what.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.271
So I'm thinking about maybe
taking some classes.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.357
Oh, Tina, I am so proud of you.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.151
In the meantime,
I got another job.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.739
Not happening!

20:46.787 --> 20:49.164
