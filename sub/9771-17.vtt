parts

- Just 'cause she wanted
attention.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.764
- Can you believe
someone would do that?

19:00.848 --> 19:02.099
- Yeah, I mean, what kind of

19:02.182 --> 19:02.724
person just lies like that?

19:02.808 --> 19:03.892
- So lame.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.520
- Yeah, and the sad thing is,

19:06.603 --> 19:08.522
now nobody likes her.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.900
- Yeah, well, who likes a liar?

19:11.984 --> 19:12.234
- I know.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.364
- Well, it's getting late.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.574
I'm gonna go

19:18.657 --> 19:19.616
brush my teeth.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.035
- Yeah. Me, too.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.756
- You want some water

19:34.840 --> 19:36.091
before you go to bed?

19:36.174 --> 19:37.259
- Nah. No, thanks.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.056
- Everything okay?

19:43.557 --> 19:44.516
- Yeah.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.476
Well...

19:46.560 --> 19:48.395
no.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.109
- It's working.
- Shh.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.277
- What's wrong?

19:55.360 --> 19:57.571
- Well, you know how

19:57.654 --> 19:58.739
I wanted to stay here

19:58.822 --> 20:00.198
the past couple of nights?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.199
- Yeah?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.120
- It wasn't really
'cause I was scared.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.788
- Ha.
- Up top.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.292
- You're not scared?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.295
- Well, I was the first night...

20:13.378 --> 20:14.421
for a little while.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.088
- Then why'd you keep

20:15.172 --> 20:16.298
pretending to be scared?

20:16.381 --> 20:20.677
Why'd you keep want to spending
the night here?

20:20.761 --> 20:21.303
- 'Cause I missed you.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.598
- What do you mean?

20:24.681 --> 20:26.391
I see you around campus
all the time.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.809
- Well, yeah.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.936
We walk by each other and wave

20:29.019 --> 20:31.688
and say hi, but...

20:33.148 --> 20:35.317
it's been a long time
since we just hung out

20:35.400 --> 20:37.569
and did stuff together.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.571
- Well, why didn't you just

20:39.655 --> 20:41.198
tell me you wanted to
hang out then?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.366
- I tried a couple of times.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.535
It's just you're always
hanging out

20:45.619 --> 20:49.081
with Lola or Quinn or Chase
or Michael,

20:49.164 --> 20:50.832
never me.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.252
That's why I lied
about being scared.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.880
I just missed you.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.133
- Ohh, Dustin.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.350
[crying]

21:08.433 --> 21:09.518
I'm sorry.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.269
- You can stay here.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.813
- You can move in with us.

21:12.896 --> 21:16.191
- You can even take
a digital picture of my bra.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.276
- I...can't...

21:18.360 --> 21:19.278
breathe.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.279
[groaning]

21:26.785 --> 21:28.036
- [laughing] It's all purple.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.330
Here's a Band-Aid.

21:32.124 --> 21:32.958
- How could you two
just let those guys

21:33.041 --> 21:35.210
beat me up last night?

21:35.293 --> 21:36.253
How could you do that?

21:36.336 --> 21:37.295
- It was easy.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.380
- We just walked back into

21:38.463 --> 21:38.880
the dorm and went to sleep.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.341
[laughing]

21:41.425 --> 21:42.509
- Nice.
- Chase.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.885
- Hey, Chase.
- What's up?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.429
- You see Mr. Dobson's
new Porsche?

21:45.512 --> 21:46.555
- No, he got a Porsche?

21:46.638 --> 21:47.889
- Yeah, you gotta go
check it out.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.100
- It's drippin'.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.148
- Oh. Did you hear that?

21:56.231 --> 21:58.191
[laughing] Did you hear?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.401
He said drippin'.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.193
Ha ha ha ha.
I did it.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.280
I started a new slang word.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.865
- Wait. What do you mean?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.408
- Drippin'. I started that.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.285
That's my word. Ha ha.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.453
- No, you didn't.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.038
Everybody says "drippin'."

22:11.121 --> 22:13.165
- Yeah, 'cause I started it.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.916
Tell 'em.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.002
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

22:18.336 --> 22:20.922
- See? You didn't start
"drippin'."

22:21.006 --> 22:21.923
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.259
Tell 'em I started "drippin'".

22:24.342 --> 22:25.510
Tell--tell--

22:25.594 --> 22:27.929
Aw, man, that--

22:28.013 --> 22:29.056
I started a new word,
and I'm not even gonna

22:29.139 --> 22:31.224
get credit for it?

22:31.308 --> 22:32.434
That is wrong. That is--

22:32.517 --> 22:33.810
that is so wrong, Logan.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.103
Oh, that is messed up.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.688
You know what? That is--
that is...

22:36.772 --> 22:38.565
that is flump.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.358
Yeah. Yeah.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.693
That is flump.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.861
Yep, that's it.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.530
Yeah, it means "not good."
flump.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.948
- Oh, god.

22:47.032 --> 22:47.616
- That's right, flump.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.283
You heard it here first,

22:48.366 --> 22:49.117
{\an8}ladies and gentlemen.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.410
{\an8}Flump--that's right.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.829
{\an8}Flump.
It's--it's not--it's...

22:52.913 --> 22:54.915
{\an8}hey, hey, where you guys going,

22:54.998 --> 22:57.209
