00:18.435 --> 00:21.237
What started off as an
unknown virus in Wuhan, China

00:21.272 --> 00:24.073
has exploded into a
worldwide pandemic.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.444
Until recently, most people
had never heard of COVID-19,

00:27.478 --> 00:29.580
otherwise known as coronavirus.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.949
As the death toll continues
to rise around the world,

00:32.982 --> 00:34.817
governments have
taken extreme measures

00:34.851 --> 00:36.553
in countries like Italy,

00:36.587 --> 00:39.922
where a mandatory closing of
all business has taken place.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.426
People around the world have
been ordered to stay home.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.394
In country after country,

00:43.427 --> 00:45.995
travel restrictions
have been put in place.

00:46.029 --> 00:48.399
Events with large gatherings
have been canceled.

00:48.432 --> 00:49.866
Self-quarantine,

00:49.899 --> 00:50.967
stock market plunges,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.370
medical professionals trying
to make sense of it all

00:53.404 --> 00:55.506
as they work to find a vaccine.

00:55.539 --> 00:58.342
And as this modern-day plague
continues across the globe,

00:58.375 --> 01:00.344
one question is on
everyone's mind:

01:00.377 --> 01:02.513
can anyone find a
way to stop this?

02:15.719 --> 02:18.087
Oh man.

02:18.121 --> 02:19.956
So glad to get home.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.660
Hey, don't.

02:23.694 --> 02:27.498
Oh my gosh, you know how
great it is to be home?

02:27.531 --> 02:28.365
Yeah, good...

02:28.399 --> 02:29.633
We needed a vacation
from a vacation.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.669
You had a good time
though, didn't you babe?

02:32.703 --> 02:33.903
Of course!

02:33.936 --> 02:37.441
You know what, we always have
good anniversary vacations.

02:37.474 --> 02:39.175
They're always fun!

02:39.208 --> 02:40.477
Well here's to 30 more.

02:44.080 --> 02:44.914
Hey.

02:47.451 --> 02:49.553
Hey babe, would you
like something to drink?

02:49.586 --> 02:51.355
Yeah, some
water would be great!

02:51.388 --> 02:52.922
All right, coming up!

02:53.624 --> 02:55.325
You know, I was gonna ask ya,

02:55.359 --> 02:56.427
do you think we
could get a couple

02:56.460 --> 02:58.562
of those pictures from the ocean

02:58.595 --> 03:02.366
and get 'em blown up
into maybe eight by 10s?

03:04.668 --> 03:07.604
For my dad, I just think he'd
enjoy looking at the ocean.

03:07.638 --> 03:09.640
You know he sits in
that room all day.

03:09.673 --> 03:11.675
He does, I think
it's a great idea.

03:12.743 --> 03:13.677
You know what, it's been a while

03:13.710 --> 03:15.479
since we've seen the grandkids.

03:16.747 --> 03:17.980
Yeah.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.684
And I need to go see
my father tomorrow.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.622
Well, let's go pick them
up on the way over there.

03:25.656 --> 03:26.723
- Let's do that.
- You know how much

03:26.757 --> 03:29.693
Sarah would love to see Max.

03:29.726 --> 03:30.527
You wanna do it?

03:30.561 --> 03:31.295
- Yes!
- Come on.

03:31.328 --> 03:33.664
- Let's do it baby.
- Awesome.

03:41.672 --> 03:43.607
How are we doing today Max?

03:45.208 --> 03:47.109
Anxious to see the family.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.111
Especially the girls.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.280
I see.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.182
Well, you go ahead and make
sure you take these, okay.

03:53.216 --> 03:54.150
Yeah, yeah.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.321
I don't see the
point, really, Katie.

03:58.789 --> 04:01.258
I'm not gonna live that
much longer anyway.

04:01.291 --> 04:04.695
Oh stop, a negative
attitude never helped anybody.

04:04.728 --> 04:07.096
I'm sure the girls
will cheer you up.

04:07.129 --> 04:09.065
I'll check back up
on you later, okay.

04:09.098 --> 04:09.733
Okay.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.371
Papa!

04:14.404 --> 04:16.640
Hey, Allie, Sarah!

04:16.673 --> 04:19.476
How are my two little sweeties?

04:19.510 --> 04:22.346
Hey Dad, how are you?

04:22.379 --> 04:24.581
How are you doing today Dad?

04:24.615 --> 04:26.015
I'm doing better now.

04:27.317 --> 04:29.686
Came by to check on your
inheritance, have you?

04:33.122 --> 04:35.091
Positive as always.

04:35.124 --> 04:36.593
Hey listen, we
brought you back

04:36.627 --> 04:38.662
a gift from our trip!

04:38.695 --> 04:41.698
You didn't bring me
another great grandchild?

04:43.132 --> 04:44.568
No, no!

04:44.601 --> 04:46.135
It's a watch Dad.

04:46.168 --> 04:47.337
Oh!

04:47.371 --> 04:48.037
Look.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.474
It's a Swiss watch from Europe.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.209
Will it tell me how
much time I've got left?

04:55.879 --> 04:59.783
You know, the real gift
of life is these two.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.388
How would both of you

05:04.421 --> 05:07.089
like to go out and
feed the ducks?

05:07.123 --> 05:08.292
Yay!

05:09.293 --> 05:11.495
You think you really
should be going out Dad?

05:11.528 --> 05:14.831
Oh cocky poo, I'll be
dead tomorrow anyway.

05:15.832 --> 05:17.467
Oh Dad.

05:17.501 --> 05:18.702
We have to go.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.672
We're meeting James
and Naomi for lunch.

05:21.705 --> 05:23.740
We just wanted to stop
by, give you the watch

05:23.774 --> 05:25.742
and let the girls say hello.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.611
Pizza grandpa?

05:27.644 --> 05:30.414
Can we feed the ducks pizza?

05:30.447 --> 05:31.548
I don't think that's...

05:31.582 --> 05:36.286
You can feed those ducks
anything you want sweetie!

05:39.523 --> 05:42.593
We have to go now Dad,
I'll talk to you later.

05:42.626 --> 05:43.393
Bye Papa.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.695
- Love you Papa!
- Bye sweetheart.

05:44.728 --> 05:46.663
I love you too baby.

05:46.697 --> 05:47.864
- Let's go.
- See ya.

05:47.898 --> 05:49.165
- Bye Dad.
- Bye!

05:49.198 --> 05:49.800
Love you.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.668
- Bye.
- Bye, love you!

05:53.270 --> 05:55.706
Grandma and
grandpa took us to see Papa.

05:55.739 --> 05:57.441
Oh, did you two have fun?

05:58.775 --> 06:01.812
And Papa said we could
feed the ducks some pizza.

06:02.646 --> 06:04.381
That old man will
let Sarah and Allie

06:04.414 --> 06:05.582
do anything they want.

06:06.683 --> 06:08.619
Good evening everyone, Bruce?

06:08.652 --> 06:09.453
Tony.

06:09.486 --> 06:10.287
James.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.421
How are ya?

06:11.455 --> 06:13.290
It's good to see you
James, it's been a long time.

06:13.323 --> 06:14.291
Yes it has.

06:14.324 --> 06:16.760
Does that mean Bruce
is gonna pay the bill?

06:18.194 --> 06:19.663
Could be Tony.

06:19.696 --> 06:20.764
Could be.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.231
Well thank you for coming in.

06:22.265 --> 06:24.534
Appreciate seeing everybody,
have a good night.

06:24.568 --> 06:25.669
- Thank you.
- You too.

06:25.702 --> 06:26.536
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:27.771 --> 06:29.506
So how's
Pop doing Dad?

06:29.539 --> 06:31.341
Nothing's changed.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.709
He still thinks
I'm after ,

06:32.743 --> 06:33.577
after his money.

06:35.278 --> 06:36.647
Honey, are you all right?

06:36.680 --> 06:37.848
Here, drink some water.

06:39.549 --> 06:42.386
I hope it's not
that crap virus.

06:42.419 --> 06:44.521
What's that James,
the coronavirus?

06:44.554 --> 06:45.522
Yes.

06:45.555 --> 06:48.458
I have a better chance
of winning the lottery.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.227
Dad, you need to
take this seriously!

06:51.261 --> 06:53.497
You and Mom did just
get back from Europe.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.600
You know things are worse
over there than they are here.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.634
I'm not sick Naomi.

06:59.369 --> 07:00.704
Let me check and see
how you're doing honey.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.204
- I said I'm okay!
- Okay!

07:02.238 --> 07:04.307
As a matter of
fact, I'm ready to go!

07:04.341 --> 07:05.509
I need to get back
to work tomorrow.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.310
- Dad.
- Ooh, touchy.

07:08.478 --> 07:09.913
You think I'm touchy?

07:09.946 --> 07:11.748
I am touchy!

07:11.782 --> 07:14.284
Because I just lost a
major account this week

07:14.317 --> 07:15.952
due to this flu panic!

07:15.986 --> 07:18.789
It's not panic to be cautious.

07:18.822 --> 07:20.457
It is panic!

07:20.490 --> 07:21.858
People are losing their minds!

07:21.892 --> 07:23.593
Look at social media.

07:23.627 --> 07:26.830
All the naysayers and
do-sayers and dumb asses!

07:26.863 --> 07:28.999
They're going crazy on there.

07:29.032 --> 07:29.833
Dad...

07:29.866 --> 07:31.568
The place is a panic!

07:31.601 --> 07:33.403
You have all the
conspiracy theorists

07:33.437 --> 07:35.405
and all the downers and
uppers and everything else,

07:35.439 --> 07:36.707
it's panic!

07:36.740 --> 07:38.308
A million people die every year

07:39.009 --> 07:42.379
from accidents, but nobody
shuts down the freeways!

07:42.412 --> 07:43.447
This is different!

07:43.480 --> 07:44.448
It is?

07:44.481 --> 07:46.817
Because 50,000 people
die a year from the flu!

07:46.850 --> 07:48.351
And I don't see
the world economy

07:48.385 --> 07:50.020
shutting down
because of the flu!

07:50.053 --> 07:51.755
It's not the same thing!

07:51.788 --> 07:52.689
How do you know?

07:52.723 --> 07:53.623
How do you know?

07:53.657 --> 07:54.324
Because I think I
know the difference

07:54.357 --> 07:55.926
between the flu and a plague!

07:55.959 --> 07:56.827
Please!

07:56.860 --> 07:57.961
The kids?

07:59.463 --> 08:00.630
I'm sorry babies.

08:01.531 --> 08:02.766
I had a hard day at work.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.202
It's okay grandpa.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.972
Can I help too grandpa?

08:09.005 --> 08:10.907
No baby, not this time.

08:10.941 --> 08:12.709
But thank you so much.

08:16.780 --> 08:17.714
I'm out of here.

08:18.782 --> 08:19.716
I'm sorry guys.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.585
Naomi, I'll give you
a call tomorrow, okay.

08:21.618 --> 08:22.619
- Okay Mom, be safe.
- I love you.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.689
- See you tomorrow!
- Tell grandpa I love him.

08:25.722 --> 08:26.723
- Love you.
- Same!

08:26.757 --> 08:27.758
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:29.793 --> 08:32.696
He is becoming
more like Papa every day.

08:39.703 --> 08:42.038
Man, it's good to be back.

08:51.681 --> 08:52.716
Dave, what's up?

08:52.749 --> 08:53.784
Welcome back!

08:54.751 --> 08:55.619
You got a minute?

08:55.652 --> 08:57.487
Absolutely, come
on in, have a seat.

09:00.724 --> 09:01.858
You okay buddy?

09:01.892 --> 09:03.460
Oh yeah, I'm great.

09:03.493 --> 09:04.528
What's on your mind?

09:04.561 --> 09:05.695
How was your trip?

09:05.729 --> 09:08.331
Ah, Laura and I
had a fantastic time.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.734
Man, I saw places I
never thought I'd see!

09:10.767 --> 09:12.035
And you know, I
think you'd love the

09:12.068 --> 09:14.070
beer in Europe because
it's not even close

09:14.104 --> 09:16.306
to watered down like
here in the states.

09:19.509 --> 09:20.544
You're not,

09:20.577 --> 09:23.547
you're not here to talk
about my vacation are you?

09:23.580 --> 09:26.349
Well, I'm happy you
had a nice time, but...

09:26.383 --> 09:27.751
But what?

09:27.784 --> 09:29.352
The company has to
make some hard decisions

09:29.386 --> 09:30.954
given the current situation.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.656
What situation?

09:32.689 --> 09:34.124
The virus Bruce!

09:34.157 --> 09:36.359
The stock markets are
going in the tank,

09:36.393 --> 09:38.662
the staff's a little concerned
about our fiscal health.

09:38.695 --> 09:39.863
They wanna know if
anyone's willing

09:39.896 --> 09:41.464
to come take some time off.

09:42.899 --> 09:45.402
Hey man, I just got
back from two weeks off.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.437
Yeah, I know Bruce.

09:48.405 --> 09:50.340
You're not asking
me, are you Dave?

09:51.074 --> 09:52.142
Bruce, I'm sorry.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.376
It's just for a
couple more weeks

09:53.410 --> 09:54.778
until this thing cools off.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.948
Thanks buddy.

09:57.981 --> 09:59.816
I knew you'd understand.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.684
Say hi to Laura.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.454
Right, I will do that.

10:06.489 --> 10:07.791
It could be worse.

10:07.824 --> 10:11.027
They could be shutting down
everything all together.

10:11.061 --> 10:12.395
Over this?

10:13.096 --> 10:14.798
It's no worse than the flu!

10:15.799 --> 10:18.068
Babe, that's not
what they're saying!

10:18.101 --> 10:20.070
As this
pandemic continues to worsen

10:20.103 --> 10:21.004
across the country...

10:21.037 --> 10:22.939
I think the whole
damn thing's a joke.

10:22.973 --> 10:24.641
To
temporarily shut down

10:24.674 --> 10:25.709
to contain the spread.

10:25.742 --> 10:26.810
- And now,
- Latest of which,

10:26.843 --> 10:29.713
- I have two weeks off
- Disneyland and Disney World.

10:29.746 --> 10:30.847
and nowhere to go.

10:32.983 --> 10:34.985
Even Mickey Mouse
is scared of this.

10:36.987 --> 10:39.689
I think he should ditch Sneezy

10:39.723 --> 10:41.458
and make sure Doc hangs around.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.727
Is this a joke to you?

10:43.760 --> 10:46.763
The whole freaking
thing is a joke.

10:46.796 --> 10:47.931
You know what,
then turn it off.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.900
Why don't you do
something tomorrow

10:49.933 --> 10:50.767
a little different okay.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.535
Why don't you go hiking?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.105
Get your mind off
of it, all right?

10:55.138 --> 10:55.772
Come on!

10:57.507 --> 10:59.175
You know, I'm gonna do that.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.744
You're gonna stop
watching television?

11:00.777 --> 11:02.145
No, I'm gonna go hiking.

11:02.178 --> 11:04.581
Okay good, let's
go hiking then.

11:04.614 --> 11:05.849
- Beautiful.
- I'll go with you.

11:05.882 --> 11:06.883
Thank you.

11:09.886 --> 11:10.987
Oh man!

11:11.021 --> 11:11.955
You haven't been
to church in a few weeks.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.658
Laura and I just got
back from vacation.

11:14.691 --> 11:15.892
Well sounds like a great trip.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.560
Oh, it was.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.663
Where'd you go?

11:19.696 --> 11:22.198
Oh man, I saw so many
countries and places,

11:22.232 --> 11:24.734
I don't even know
where to begin.

11:24.768 --> 11:25.702
Aren't you concerned?

11:25.735 --> 11:26.770
About what?

11:27.704 --> 11:29.773
The virus
that's going around!

11:29.806 --> 11:31.741
Not really, I think it's blown

11:31.775 --> 11:33.710
out of proportion, don't you?

11:33.743 --> 11:36.713
No, I don't think it's blown
out of proportion at all.

11:36.746 --> 11:37.781
Oh come on Jason!

11:37.814 --> 11:40.784
The media's been blowing
this up since it started!

11:46.257 --> 11:49.859
Look, it might be only
one bullet in the gun,

11:49.893 --> 11:52.095
but I'm not playing
Russian roulette either.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.199
You know, I think the
media's shooting blanks.

11:56.232 --> 11:58.201
They're creating a
panic for no reason!

12:00.670 --> 12:02.839
I think maybe they
found a better way

12:02.872 --> 12:05.108
to promote their
ratings than politics.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.778
I don't think it'd be a bad
idea if we lost a few of them.

12:09.612 --> 12:10.246
A few what?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.482
Politicians!

12:18.855 --> 12:21.157
That's a bit rough
don't you think?

12:21.191 --> 12:22.926
I'll tell you
what's a bit rough.

12:24.295 --> 12:25.729
It's the thought of
having to use sandpaper

12:25.762 --> 12:27.764
to wipe my ass because
all these crazy fools

12:27.797 --> 12:30.600
are out there buying up the
toilet paper in a panic!

12:31.768 --> 12:33.636
Ouch!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.739
I may not be able to
sit the rest of the day.

12:35.772 --> 12:38.708
Well I gotta sit down
'cause I'm out of breath.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.616
You're usually in a lot
better shape than this Bruce.

12:46.649 --> 12:47.284
You okay?

12:49.986 --> 12:51.621
Yeah Jason, I'm okay.

12:52.756 --> 12:53.590
I'm fine.

12:54.258 --> 12:55.625
Well I'm beat.

12:55.658 --> 12:57.894
Enough fresh air for
the day don't you think?

13:01.798 --> 13:02.632
Awe man.

13:04.134 --> 13:06.002
Hey sweetie,
are you done already?

13:06.036 --> 13:08.671
I think I wore Jason out!

13:08.705 --> 13:11.207
God, I guess.

13:13.109 --> 13:14.711
You okay?

13:14.744 --> 13:18.181
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.682
It seems like everywhere I go

13:19.716 --> 13:21.618
everyone asks if I'm okay!

13:21.651 --> 13:22.952
Fine!

13:22.986 --> 13:24.854
You know what, Max
called while you were out

13:24.888 --> 13:25.989
and he doesn't sound good.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.091
What's wrong with
the old man now?

13:28.124 --> 13:29.692
There's nothing
wrong with him,

13:29.726 --> 13:30.727
he just wants to talk.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.231
There's always something
wrong with my Dad.

13:35.266 --> 13:38.701
He's either sick, or he's tired,

13:38.735 --> 13:41.272
well I'm sick and tired
of hearing about it!

13:41.305 --> 13:42.806
Babe.

13:42.839 --> 13:44.375
I mean, listen,

13:44.408 --> 13:46.776
Bruce, we know you love your Dad

13:46.810 --> 13:50.680
as much any of the
family does, okay?

13:50.713 --> 13:53.783
But you don't know how
much time he has left.

13:53.817 --> 13:55.085
So you need to think about that.

13:55.118 --> 13:56.353
Life is short.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.923
All right, he's not always
easy to get along with,

13:59.956 --> 14:03.093
but listen, think
about the time you have

14:03.126 --> 14:05.962
to go see him and make
sure you go see him.

14:07.864 --> 14:08.865
I'm serious.

14:14.338 --> 14:16.773
The main symptoms
of coronavirus include

14:16.806 --> 14:18.708
dry cough, fever,

14:18.741 --> 14:19.876
and difficulties in breathing.

14:19.909 --> 14:21.878
If you're experiencing
any of this,

14:21.911 --> 14:23.012
- they highly recommend
- Oh my goodness.

14:23.046 --> 14:25.682
That you stay
home and isolate yourself.

14:26.350 --> 14:27.984
Why'd you turn it off?

14:29.886 --> 14:32.188
Babe, frankly, I'm
tired of seeing that too!

14:35.725 --> 14:38.061
You know, you need
to call a doctor.

14:38.094 --> 14:38.895
I'm not sick.

14:38.928 --> 14:41.298
You know what,
you may not be sick,

14:41.332 --> 14:43.900
but I don't wanna
get sick either.

14:43.933 --> 14:44.734
Okay?

14:58.349 --> 15:00.683
Mommy, can we go swimming?

15:00.717 --> 15:01.352
Well,

15:02.386 --> 15:03.753
sure.

15:03.786 --> 15:04.421
Go change.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.657
Yay!

15:10.994 --> 15:11.828
New book?

15:14.230 --> 15:16.966
Mom called with some
concerns about Dad.

15:19.235 --> 15:20.337
Oh.

15:20.371 --> 15:22.672
She's concerned
he might be sick.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.309
Sick,

15:25.342 --> 15:26.876
with what?

15:26.910 --> 15:28.412
Dad doesn't wanna
talk about it.

15:29.779 --> 15:31.114
So he won't see a doctor?

15:33.317 --> 15:36.152
He doesn't even wanna
talk to Mom about it James.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.289
Do you really think
he'll go see a doctor?

15:41.124 --> 15:42.725
Hang on.

15:42.759 --> 15:43.793
Hi Mom.

15:47.764 --> 15:48.399
No.

15:53.002 --> 15:54.338
Bruce.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.205
Bruce!

15:56.373 --> 15:58.841
Max's facility called today.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.278
Your Dad's tested
positive for coronavirus.

16:01.312 --> 16:02.912
You need to see a doctor.

16:04.847 --> 16:05.482
You hear me?

16:11.522 --> 16:12.356
Babe.

16:25.802 --> 16:26.869
Bruce Gunther.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.241
Babe, it's gonna be okay.

16:36.112 --> 16:39.215
Hey Bruce, how are we doing?

16:39.249 --> 16:40.883
Not good.

16:40.917 --> 16:41.985
Why?

16:42.018 --> 16:45.489
I think I need to get
tested for the coronavirus.

16:45.522 --> 16:46.889
Oh my.

16:46.923 --> 16:47.824
What's wrong?

16:47.857 --> 16:49.926
The care facility
that my father's at,

16:51.961 --> 16:54.797
they notified me that he
tested positive for the virus.

16:55.999 --> 16:56.833
Okay.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.936
I was just there last week

16:59.969 --> 17:01.338
visiting my Father!

17:02.573 --> 17:03.407
Whoa!

17:05.608 --> 17:07.877
All right don't worry about
it, I'll get you a test,

17:07.910 --> 17:09.846
go home, self-quarantine.

17:09.878 --> 17:11.548
On the way out,
don't touch anything.

17:19.390 --> 17:20.923
What happened?

17:21.858 --> 17:22.492
Let's go.

17:36.239 --> 17:39.443
I don't know honey, let's
just see what we need to do.

17:41.044 --> 17:42.045
I don't know what we're gonna do

17:42.078 --> 17:43.880
about this whole hoarding thing.

17:43.913 --> 17:47.150
People are going around
just taking stuff

17:47.183 --> 17:49.919
like they're preparing
for the end of time.

17:49.952 --> 17:50.554
Like they're not,

17:50.587 --> 17:52.155
it's just crazy.

17:52.188 --> 17:53.890
Excuse me, can you tell
me where the water is?

17:53.923 --> 17:55.459
Yes, it's on the
front shelf up front.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.493
Front shelf?

17:56.527 --> 17:58.495
Perfect, thank you so much.

17:58.529 --> 18:00.297
Oh look, there's one water babe.

18:00.331 --> 18:01.898
- One case?
- One water.

18:01.931 --> 18:02.832
- Are you kidding me?
- And look, there's.

18:02.865 --> 18:03.634
Yeah, there's
toilet paper too.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.569
What are
people thinking?

18:05.602 --> 18:06.603
Excuse me!

18:06.637 --> 18:07.571
Oh, excuse me!

18:09.172 --> 18:10.607
Whatever!

18:10.641 --> 18:12.376
- Take it!
- Seriously!

18:13.277 --> 18:14.445
Do people
actually realize

18:14.478 --> 18:15.579
that this is a respiratory

18:15.612 --> 18:18.282
and not a
gastrointestinal virus?

18:18.315 --> 18:21.050
Why would anyone need that
many rolls of toilet paper?

18:21.084 --> 18:22.885
Evidently she does.

18:22.919 --> 18:23.620
Let her have it.

18:24.987 --> 18:27.257
At least we have
two weeks, right?

18:27.291 --> 18:28.359
I think.

18:28.392 --> 18:29.959
Maybe.

18:29.992 --> 18:30.761
Let's go.

18:30.794 --> 18:32.363
Honey, let's just
get out of here.

18:32.396 --> 18:33.229
Get the water.

18:42.573 --> 18:45.174
Did you know when you
sent that test off?

18:46.109 --> 18:47.578
I think it was
about three days...

18:51.180 --> 18:53.650
You all right?

18:53.684 --> 18:54.651
I think about three days ago.

18:56.487 --> 18:58.221
We should get the
results any time.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.292
Ah, there's the doctor now.

19:02.326 --> 19:03.159
Hello doc.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.995
Yes.

19:06.028 --> 19:07.297
I've been okay I guess.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.967
Really?

19:14.271 --> 19:15.372
Okay.

19:15.406 --> 19:16.640
Thank you doctor.

19:22.646 --> 19:23.980
Well?

19:24.615 --> 19:26.683
Positive for the coronavirus.

19:28.285 --> 19:29.152
Serious?

19:29.185 --> 19:30.153
He said to just
take the medication,

19:30.186 --> 19:32.523
follow the directions
and stay quarantined.

19:35.057 --> 19:37.361
That means
you got it in Europe.

19:37.394 --> 19:41.465
How many people have you
been around since then honey?

19:41.498 --> 19:42.932
You need to go get tested.

19:46.169 --> 19:47.604
Oh no!

19:47.638 --> 19:48.472
What!

19:49.473 --> 19:52.643
You transmitted
that to your Dad!

19:53.510 --> 19:54.511
Do you realize that?

20:03.654 --> 20:04.621
Hey Max!

20:06.590 --> 20:07.724
How are we doing today?

20:09.726 --> 20:12.228
I wanna see my sweeties.

20:12.262 --> 20:15.499
Oh.

20:15.532 --> 20:16.700
Oh no.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.336
Max, I'm sorry,
your picture broke.

20:19.369 --> 20:21.605
And I'm so sorry you
can't see your family.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.640
Maybe you can visit
them through the window?

20:28.077 --> 20:31.247
I just hope they
will both pull through.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.119
Mommy.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.689
When can we go see Papa?

20:40.657 --> 20:42.359
Soon, hopefully.

20:43.794 --> 20:46.797
Your Papa is sick
and your Grandpa too.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.130
What's wrong?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.334
Well,

20:53.202 --> 20:55.706
they have a bad virus.

20:55.739 --> 20:58.342
You mean like a cold?

20:58.375 --> 20:59.710
No.

20:59.743 --> 21:00.611
Sort of.

21:00.644 --> 21:02.646
It's like a really bad flu.

21:04.348 --> 21:05.716
Is he gonna be all right?

21:09.720 --> 21:10.687
We're not sure Sarah.

21:12.723 --> 21:14.658
I don't want Papa to die!

21:14.691 --> 21:16.493
I love my Papa!

21:27.604 --> 21:28.705
It's okay babe.

21:31.341 --> 21:32.709
Well that's a change.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.078
How's that?

21:36.112 --> 21:39.115
I never thought I'd
see you sleeping on the couch.

21:40.684 --> 21:42.719
I don't know
how, but you know what,

21:42.753 --> 21:44.521
my test came back negative.

21:45.489 --> 21:46.423
Oh thank God!

21:48.292 --> 21:50.494
It must be all the hand
washing you're doing.

21:52.829 --> 21:54.598
Naomi, and
Jason, and the girls

21:54.631 --> 21:56.300
went and got tested, okay.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.869
And there's a whole
list of who's got tested

21:58.902 --> 22:02.104
that you were around when
the Health Department called.

22:02.138 --> 22:03.105
They let them know.

22:05.207 --> 22:06.610
What about my work.

22:06.643 --> 22:09.279
Honey, I told
them all about your work.

22:09.313 --> 22:10.380
Okay, good.

22:12.716 --> 22:14.685
You know, I didn't
take this seriously,

22:15.852 --> 22:17.654
and look at me now.

22:20.657 --> 22:22.726
Look, the
care center called today

22:22.759 --> 22:26.195
and they said Dad's
not doing very well.

22:30.767 --> 22:31.702
Ever since
he's been in that place

22:31.735 --> 22:33.770
he's been a pain in the ass!

22:35.639 --> 22:37.808
I've avoided seeing him
for the last 10 years

22:39.343 --> 22:41.210
and now I may not
get another chance!

22:55.626 --> 22:56.460
Honey.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.697
You can't avoid the wind
until it blows you over.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.302
Let's see how you're
doing today, okay?

23:06.436 --> 23:07.638
Let's hope for the best.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.446
103.5!

23:17.581 --> 23:18.515
That's not good!

23:19.716 --> 23:21.183
I'm calling the doctor.

23:22.653 --> 23:23.820
It's okay.

23:27.791 --> 23:30.427
So don't drive, I'll
call the hospital,

23:30.460 --> 23:32.496
send somebody as
soon as possible,

23:32.529 --> 23:35.866
and make sure, clean the
house once he's gone.

24:19.009 --> 24:20.010
Hello.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.445
Hi Mom.

24:21.478 --> 24:22.546
Hey Naomi.

24:22.579 --> 24:23.613
Are you doing okay?

24:23.647 --> 24:24.614
Yeah.

24:24.648 --> 24:26.917
Your Dad just left for
the hospital right now.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.318
Did he drive himself?

24:28.351 --> 24:30.387
No honey, he's
not driving, no.

24:30.420 --> 24:31.288
The ambulance took him.

24:31.321 --> 24:33.423
Oh, thank
goodness for that.

24:33.457 --> 24:34.357
Yeah.

24:34.391 --> 24:35.625
I'm worried.

24:35.659 --> 24:36.893
No, he's gonna be okay.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.698
Did you get your
test results in?

24:42.766 --> 24:43.667
Yes.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.603
Thank God we are all negative.

24:46.636 --> 24:48.705
The girls are really
upset about Papa.

24:50.073 --> 24:50.907
Now,

24:52.609 --> 24:54.778
what am I supposed to
tell them about Dad?

24:55.612 --> 24:56.813
No honey, don't
tell them right now.

24:56.847 --> 24:58.482
That'll just scare them.

24:58.515 --> 24:59.783
Okay?

24:59.816 --> 25:01.318
It's gonna be okay.

25:01.351 --> 25:02.185
Hey listen,

25:02.219 --> 25:03.420
your Dad's phone's
ringing right now.

25:03.453 --> 25:04.221
I'll give you a call back.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.422
I'll
talk to you later.

25:05.455 --> 25:06.356
All right.

25:06.389 --> 25:07.657
- I love you.
- I love you.

25:07.691 --> 25:08.525
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:13.029 --> 25:13.864
Hello.

25:17.033 --> 25:17.868
Yes.

25:20.637 --> 25:21.671
No, he's not here.

25:21.705 --> 25:23.473
This is his wife Laura.

25:29.746 --> 25:34.751
Oh my God, no!

25:35.719 --> 25:36.553
No.

25:40.757 --> 25:41.792
Okay.

25:44.094 --> 25:44.928
Yeah.

26:08.652 --> 26:10.120
Mrs. Gunther?

26:10.153 --> 26:11.087
Yes doctor.

26:11.121 --> 26:12.923
Yes, I'm Dr. Bahadura,
please have a seat.

26:14.124 --> 26:15.525
Can I see him?

26:15.559 --> 26:16.726
No.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.695
Bruce is in isolation.

26:18.728 --> 26:20.430
Gonna need to
remain in quarantine

26:20.463 --> 26:22.465
until he tests
negative for the virus.

26:23.466 --> 26:24.768
Is he gonna be all right?

26:24.801 --> 26:27.037
Well, we certainly hope so.

26:27.070 --> 26:29.706
Just know, he has a
great team of doctors

26:29.739 --> 26:31.041
that are treating him.

26:31.074 --> 26:33.777
And I'll keep ya informed
as I know more, okay?

26:35.078 --> 26:36.980
Thank you doctor.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.048
Appreciate it.

26:38.081 --> 26:38.882
Doctor!

26:38.915 --> 26:40.717
Yes.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.552
Do you mind just
giving him these?

26:45.488 --> 26:46.156
It's the only way
if we're gonna be

26:46.189 --> 26:47.824
able to communicate for a while.

26:47.858 --> 26:50.093
So I appreciate it.

26:50.126 --> 26:51.027
Sure.

26:51.061 --> 26:51.895
Thanks.

26:58.935 --> 27:00.737
Well.

27:00.770 --> 27:01.738
We'll wait it out.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.741
At least we've
got communication.

27:05.675 --> 27:06.676
That's good.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.944
- That's true.
- Yeah.

27:10.013 --> 27:12.749
Honey.

27:12.782 --> 27:14.084
Papa died last night.

27:23.693 --> 27:24.728
I'm sorry.

27:25.862 --> 27:26.930
I'm so sorry.

27:37.774 --> 27:38.808
Hello.

27:39.709 --> 27:40.744
Who's this?

27:42.112 --> 27:43.480
Are you kidding me?

27:44.648 --> 27:45.949
How'd you get this number?

27:47.817 --> 27:48.919
What?

27:48.952 --> 27:50.620
Who was that?

27:50.654 --> 27:51.955
It was the press.

27:51.988 --> 27:54.624
They're already calling
me about your father.

27:54.658 --> 27:56.559
Like I don't have
enough to deal with.

27:58.662 --> 28:00.597
How are we gonna tell Dad?

28:02.999 --> 28:04.501
I'll deal with it honey.

28:05.635 --> 28:07.203
Don't worry about it.

28:09.739 --> 28:10.707
James and I will

28:12.542 --> 28:16.112
do anything we can to help
with Papa's arrangements.

28:16.146 --> 28:16.980
Okay.

28:18.815 --> 28:20.016
I appreciate that.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.153
Thank you so much, but please,

28:23.186 --> 28:26.523
just go home and be
with those girls.

28:26.556 --> 28:27.757
They need you right now.

28:30.927 --> 28:31.928
I love you.

28:31.962 --> 28:34.164
I love you too.

28:34.197 --> 28:38.902
I love you.

28:51.781 --> 28:52.849
I hun!

28:52.882 --> 28:53.883
Hi honey.

28:53.917 --> 28:55.719
Oh thank God it's you!

28:55.752 --> 28:57.087
Who'd you expect,
the funeral home?

28:57.120 --> 28:59.256
Oh my God, don't say that!

28:59.290 --> 29:00.724
It's not even funny.

29:00.757 --> 29:01.825
I know.

29:01.858 --> 29:03.660
Hey, how are you?

29:03.693 --> 29:04.561
About the same.

29:04.594 --> 29:06.162
Hard to breathe, fever.

29:06.196 --> 29:08.832
You know, all the
things that make you

29:08.865 --> 29:10.834
wanna be around someone.

29:10.867 --> 29:12.602
Well, under the circumstances

29:12.635 --> 29:14.738
that's better than
the alternatives.

29:14.771 --> 29:15.705
I guess so.

29:15.739 --> 29:16.639
What are you up to?

29:16.673 --> 29:18.742
I'm just cleaning
up around the house.

29:18.775 --> 29:20.710
I'll tell you one thing,

29:20.744 --> 29:22.612
they've been great here.

29:22.645 --> 29:24.180
Although I know I haven't been.

29:24.214 --> 29:27.851
Nothing like a God smack down
to bring you back to reality.

29:28.818 --> 29:31.721
Tomorrow I'm gonna have
to make the arrangements.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.690
What arrangements?

29:38.228 --> 29:39.062
I'm sorry hun.

29:40.597 --> 29:41.698
I didn't tell you yet.

29:43.066 --> 29:44.768
I didn't know how to say this.

29:45.835 --> 29:46.870
Say what?

29:47.937 --> 29:48.872
Your father died.

29:51.908 --> 29:54.744
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you in the hospital.

29:54.778 --> 29:56.079
I didn't want you to be upset.

29:58.148 --> 29:59.816
The funeral's on Saturday.

30:00.683 --> 30:01.751
Okay but not that
many people could be

30:01.785 --> 30:03.787
at the funeral
because of the crowd.

30:06.823 --> 30:08.359
I gotta go.

30:08.392 --> 30:09.225
Love you.

30:10.860 --> 30:11.728
I love you too.

30:20.937 --> 30:23.239
Max Gunther was a father,

30:24.874 --> 30:28.244
a grandfather, and
a great-grandfather.

30:29.346 --> 30:33.083
He was a man you had
to know to appreciate.

30:34.418 --> 30:38.389
After his wife Jane
died 10 years ago,

30:38.422 --> 30:40.824
he didn't seem to tolerate much

30:40.857 --> 30:43.693
or wanna deal with many people.

30:43.726 --> 30:46.129
But he always loved his family.

30:47.831 --> 30:50.800
Especially Allie and Sarah.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.636
He was a man who
found it hard to

30:53.670 --> 30:57.240
show love in the last few
years of his life on earth.

30:58.342 --> 31:00.844
And often, quarrel
with his son Bruce,

31:02.712 --> 31:06.883
but he would sometimes
share with his caretakers

31:06.916 --> 31:09.953
how much he really
loved his family.

31:09.986 --> 31:12.822
And yes, even Bruce.

31:14.124 --> 31:16.793
Remember, as we
read Romans eight,

31:17.827 --> 31:21.631
verses 35 and 37 through 39.

31:22.899 --> 31:25.802
"Who will separate us
from the love of Christ?

31:25.835 --> 31:28.171
"Will hardship, or distress,

31:28.204 --> 31:31.174
"or persecution, or famine,

31:31.207 --> 31:35.712
"or nakedness, or
peril, or sword?"

31:35.745 --> 31:39.115
Or in this case,
virus or plague?

31:40.116 --> 31:42.152
"No, in all these things

31:42.185 --> 31:43.720
"we are more than conquerors

31:43.753 --> 31:45.822
"through Him who loved us.

31:45.855 --> 31:49.260
"For I am convinced that
neither death nor life

31:49.293 --> 31:51.928
"nor angels nor rulers,

31:51.961 --> 31:54.864
"nor things present,
nor things to come,

31:54.898 --> 31:57.133
"nor powers, nor height,

31:57.167 --> 32:00.870
"nor death, nor anything
else in all creation

32:00.904 --> 32:03.773
"will be able to separate
us from the love of God

32:03.806 --> 32:06.209
"in Christ Jesus our Lord."

32:08.244 --> 32:09.245
Let us pray.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.784
Almighty God, in
Your great love,

32:14.817 --> 32:17.153
You crafted us by Your hand,

32:17.187 --> 32:20.990
and breathed life into
us by Your spirit.

32:22.459 --> 32:24.261
We commend ourselves

32:24.295 --> 32:27.030
and we join with all
Your faithful people

32:27.063 --> 32:29.165
and the whole company of Heaven

32:29.199 --> 32:32.902
in the one unending
song of praise.

32:32.936 --> 32:35.872
All glory and wisdom

32:35.905 --> 32:38.975
and honor be to our God,

32:39.008 --> 32:41.911
forever and ever, amen.

32:44.448 --> 32:47.418
Please remain seated
as the family departs.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.295
Yes baby, yeah.

33:00.897 --> 33:02.932
Listen, you need to
talk to your grandkids

33:02.966 --> 33:04.335
and just reassure them.

33:05.902 --> 33:06.769
They're scared honey.

33:06.803 --> 33:08.871
Please put them on Laura.

33:08.905 --> 33:09.872
Okay.

33:09.906 --> 33:12.543
Allie and Sarah, Grandpa
wants to talk to you.

33:12.576 --> 33:15.078
Hi grandpa.

33:15.111 --> 33:16.045
Listen girls,

33:17.247 --> 33:18.382
I'm gonna be fine.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.051
I just have to stay here
a little bit longer,

33:23.086 --> 33:25.121
until the doctors can heal me.

33:25.154 --> 33:26.823
I'm really sorry about Papa.

33:27.558 --> 33:30.461
But you know he's in
a better place, right?

33:30.494 --> 33:31.794
Yes Grandpa.

33:33.930 --> 33:36.333
Are you gonna die like Papa?

33:36.367 --> 33:37.368
No sweetheart.

33:37.401 --> 33:38.835
I'm gonna be just fine.

33:39.936 --> 33:42.238
I don't want you to
worry about me, okay?

33:44.575 --> 33:45.842
Good.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.411
Let me talk to Grandma now.

33:48.911 --> 33:49.546
I love you both.

33:50.847 --> 33:52.148
Bye, love you.

33:52.181 --> 33:53.550
Love you Grandpa, bye!

33:55.452 --> 33:57.820
Hey honey, talk to you later.

33:58.888 --> 34:00.291
I love you Laura.

34:00.324 --> 34:01.157
I love you too.

34:02.493 --> 34:03.494
Okay, bye.

34:07.864 --> 34:09.333
Give Grandma hugs.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.068
We all could use it right now.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.062
You want a water?

34:39.094 --> 34:41.431
No thanks, I don't think so.

34:42.632 --> 34:43.434
Mommy.

34:43.467 --> 34:45.601
Can we have a Popsicle?

34:45.636 --> 34:47.969
No honey, not right now.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.038
Go change your clothes.

34:49.072 --> 34:50.973
I don't want you
playing in them.

34:52.241 --> 34:55.078
Next time, you're asking.

34:55.110 --> 34:57.947
Allie, Sarah,
listen to your mother!

35:04.921 --> 35:06.290
I don't know
what Mom's gonna do

35:06.323 --> 35:07.957
if Dad doesn't pull through?

35:09.058 --> 35:11.595
I don't know if
she's gonna make it.

35:12.962 --> 35:14.163
Really?

35:14.197 --> 35:15.965
Your Dad seems
like a healthy guy.

35:15.998 --> 35:17.334
I'm sure he'll be fine.

35:17.368 --> 35:18.535
Look what happened to Papa!

35:18.569 --> 35:21.405
And none of us saw that coming!

35:21.438 --> 35:22.939
Max was an old man.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.443
He doesn't have that much
longer to live anyway!

35:26.477 --> 35:28.911
That makes me
feel so much better.

36:11.688 --> 36:13.257
Hi sweetheart.

36:13.290 --> 36:14.123
Hey.

36:15.692 --> 36:17.361
How are you?

36:17.394 --> 36:19.128
I feel like crap!

36:19.162 --> 36:20.930
You know, I've had
the flu before,

36:22.098 --> 36:25.335
but this bug is kicking
me in the ass man!

36:25.369 --> 36:26.370
Well I'm sorry babe,

36:26.403 --> 36:29.205
I've just been going
through the mail right now

36:29.238 --> 36:32.643
and we got our
first medical bill.

36:32.676 --> 36:34.545
And everyone is
saying it's okay,

36:34.578 --> 36:36.580
but I don't know how
it's gonna be okay.

36:37.481 --> 36:38.615
Who knows when
you're gonna get out

36:38.649 --> 36:42.218
and we have no money coming
in, you know what I mean?

36:42.252 --> 36:44.120
How do we know when
you're gonna be

36:44.153 --> 36:45.589
out and back to work, right?

36:46.757 --> 36:47.591
Remember,

36:48.559 --> 36:50.960
good things come to
those who love the Lord.

36:52.629 --> 36:55.097
And to those who are
called to His purpose.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.500
We'll figure something out.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.703
What do you mean purpose?

37:00.637 --> 37:02.473
I mean, is it your
purpose to sit

37:02.506 --> 37:05.241
in a hospital with
a stupid virus?

37:07.176 --> 37:09.480
Is it my purpose to sit here

37:09.513 --> 37:11.247
and deal with
these stupid bills?

37:11.281 --> 37:12.215
I mean really?

37:12.248 --> 37:13.684
Are we really gonna be okay?

37:13.717 --> 37:15.552
Huh babe?

37:15.586 --> 37:17.788
I'm sorry I'm so sick.

37:17.821 --> 37:21.023
Don't be sorry,
just get better.

37:25.662 --> 37:28.365
I mean, I don't know what to do.

37:29.766 --> 37:31.568
Babe, I understand you're sick.

37:31.602 --> 37:34.103
I understand, but
it's not your fault!

37:34.136 --> 37:36.406
Okay, it's not my fault,

37:36.440 --> 37:38.275
this is not the hospitals fault,

37:38.308 --> 37:41.645
it's not works fault,

37:41.678 --> 37:44.681
it's not anybody's fault!

37:44.715 --> 37:47.751
But doesn't it have to
be somebody's fault?

37:50.152 --> 37:53.423
I mean, I'm alone babe!

37:53.457 --> 37:54.758
I don't know where to turn to!

37:56.293 --> 37:58.362
Don't be afraid baby.

37:58.395 --> 38:00.797
Why do you keep telling
me to not be afraid!

38:00.831 --> 38:02.131
I'm afraid!

38:03.567 --> 38:04.701
I can't help it!

38:06.135 --> 38:07.437
Babe?

38:07.471 --> 38:09.506
I mean, for Christ's sake!

38:09.540 --> 38:11.240
You tell me it's gonna be okay,

38:11.275 --> 38:13.744
but nobody knows if it's
gonna be okay honey.

38:13.777 --> 38:15.746
I'm by myself right now!

38:15.779 --> 38:16.446
Babe!

38:16.480 --> 38:19.349
You know, you can't touch me,

38:19.383 --> 38:20.617
I can't touch you,

38:20.651 --> 38:22.719
I mean, that's the
reality right now babe!

38:22.753 --> 38:25.389
You're quarantined,
you're away from me

38:25.422 --> 38:27.724
and I don't know when
it's gonna get better!

38:27.758 --> 38:29.158
Baby, what's going on?

38:30.727 --> 38:32.596
I mean, that's
what's the reality!

38:32.629 --> 38:36.165
I'm alone, I'm alone and
who's gonna take care of me?

38:36.198 --> 38:37.668
You're there, I'm here!

38:39.135 --> 38:40.270
I'm fine.

38:42.639 --> 38:44.374
And I'm gonna make it!

38:44.408 --> 38:45.642
Do you hear me!

38:47.477 --> 38:48.312
Babe.

38:49.613 --> 38:51.315
Laura!

38:51.348 --> 38:52.616
What!

38:52.649 --> 38:54.651
I'm gonna make it!

38:54.685 --> 38:55.886
I know.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.120
Laura!

38:58.154 --> 38:58.755
Laura!

38:58.789 --> 39:00.290
What baby, I'm sorry.

39:00.324 --> 39:01.157
I love you.

39:02.392 --> 39:05.161
I love you and I'm gonna make
it! Do you understand Laura?

39:05.194 --> 39:06.430
All right.

39:06.463 --> 39:09.131
- All right.
- I'll talk to you later.

39:09.165 --> 39:09.800
Okay?

39:11.167 --> 39:12.201
I'll talk to you later.

39:12.234 --> 39:13.604
Okay.

39:13.637 --> 39:14.471
Bye-bye.

39:15.939 --> 39:16.773
Bye.

39:23.380 --> 39:24.748
Our research tells
us this is the home

39:24.781 --> 39:26.583
- of Bruce Gunther...
- Oh no, no, no, no!

39:26.617 --> 39:27.451
This isn't gonna happen!

39:27.484 --> 39:28.719
What do you think
you're doing here?

39:28.752 --> 39:31.488
Hi, this is KRAD News

39:31.521 --> 39:34.625
and are you the wife
of Bruce Gunther?

39:34.658 --> 39:37.294
Yes, that is my husband,
but what are you doing here?

39:37.327 --> 39:38.528
This is private property!

39:38.562 --> 39:40.897
Okay, we have a few questions
for you ma'am. Do you mind?

39:40.931 --> 39:41.999
Yes I mind!

39:42.032 --> 39:44.301
Get out of my private
property, do you understand!

39:44.334 --> 39:46.202
How long has your
husband been sick!

39:46.235 --> 39:46.870
- My husband's sick
- What are you doing?

39:46.903 --> 39:48.271
and you need to take

39:48.305 --> 39:49.473
your stupid crew
and get out of here!

39:49.506 --> 39:50.374
Do you hear me!

39:50.407 --> 39:51.308
- We have questions!
- Get out of here!

39:51.341 --> 39:52.208
- It's a pandemic, okay!
- Get out of here!

39:52.241 --> 39:52.909
- Look, we're sorry!
- Get out of here!

39:52.943 --> 39:54.845
But still, get away from me!

39:58.982 --> 39:59.916
Good morning Bruce,

39:59.950 --> 40:01.685
how ya feeling today?

40:02.819 --> 40:03.887
- Not good.
- No?

40:03.920 --> 40:06.657
Well, the doctor's
gonna be in a minute.

40:13.730 --> 40:15.365
All right, he'll be right in.

40:16.232 --> 40:17.233
Thank you.

40:21.772 --> 40:23.540
The death toll
continues to rise

40:23.573 --> 40:25.509
across the country as leaders

40:25.542 --> 40:26.877
and medical officials struggle.

40:26.910 --> 40:27.878
You really
think watching that's

40:27.911 --> 40:29.613
gonna help you out?

40:29.646 --> 40:32.683
What's the difference doc?

40:32.716 --> 40:35.652
I'm getting worse, not better.

40:35.686 --> 40:36.753
I'm feeling worse today.

40:37.654 --> 40:38.855
Come on Bruce,

40:38.889 --> 40:40.791
being negative is not
gonna help you at all.

40:40.824 --> 40:42.926
You gotta try and
remain positive.

40:44.127 --> 40:46.797
We're doing everything we
can for you medically, okay.

40:47.931 --> 40:49.900
But we're gonna need
your help to fight this.

40:49.933 --> 40:54.638
I mean, what can I do for
you if you just give up?

40:54.671 --> 40:55.505
You understand?

40:57.741 --> 40:58.975
Now I'm not gonna lie.

40:59.009 --> 41:01.210
You're not progressing
as we would like,

41:02.312 --> 41:04.448
but we've given you
the antibiotics,

41:04.481 --> 41:06.583
and this extra oxygen
should help with your lungs

41:06.616 --> 41:08.618
while we continue to
try and fight this.

41:10.687 --> 41:15.492
Look, I've seen a lot of
very sick people live.

41:15.525 --> 41:18.028
And I've seen a lot of
other patients not make it.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.430
But ultimately, it's up to you.

41:22.332 --> 41:24.233
And your will to
want to survive.

41:26.036 --> 41:28.739
Now tell me, when was the
last time you ate something?

41:29.806 --> 41:30.741
I'm not hungry.

41:30.774 --> 41:33.376
Come on
Bruce, you gotta try.

41:33.410 --> 41:35.512
You gotta keep up your strength.

41:35.545 --> 41:36.446
I'll talk to your family

41:36.480 --> 41:38.682
and I'll keep them
informed of everything.

41:39.850 --> 41:41.885
I'm worried about Laura.

41:41.918 --> 41:43.653
What would she do without me?

41:43.687 --> 41:45.522
Right
now, you gotta put all

41:45.555 --> 41:47.657
your energy and
focus on yourself.

41:47.691 --> 41:48.725
Worrying about
others is gonna be

41:48.759 --> 41:49.960
of no service for you.

41:52.596 --> 41:53.830
Am I gonna die doc?

41:55.832 --> 41:57.467
Get some rest Bruce.

41:57.501 --> 41:59.436
I'll come back and
check on you tomorrow.

42:00.737 --> 42:01.671
Thank you doctor.

42:14.451 --> 42:15.118
Hi Mom.

42:15.152 --> 42:17.788
Hi honey, how are you doing?

42:17.821 --> 42:19.790
Oh, we're all good here.

42:19.823 --> 42:21.825
I just picked up
some hand sanitizer.

42:21.858 --> 42:22.959
How are you?

42:22.993 --> 42:24.661
Good, good, I
wanted to tell you

42:24.694 --> 42:27.731
I have two packages
of toilet paper!

42:27.764 --> 42:28.698
Hey!

42:28.732 --> 42:31.835
Well I'll see you one
roll of toilet paper

42:31.868 --> 42:34.771
and raise you for
some hand sanitizer.

42:34.805 --> 42:36.106
How 'bout that?

42:38.008 --> 42:39.476
Sounds good.

42:39.509 --> 42:41.578
Listen, the doctor did call me

42:41.611 --> 42:44.714
and he wants to talk to
me tomorrow in the office.

42:44.748 --> 42:46.750
- And I know,
- Mom?

42:46.783 --> 42:47.717
It can't be good

42:47.751 --> 42:49.352
or he would've just
told me over the phone.

42:49.386 --> 42:50.587
You know what I mean?

42:50.620 --> 42:53.623
Yeah, you
want me to go with you?

42:53.657 --> 42:54.324
Yeah, if you don't mind.

42:54.357 --> 42:56.626
Would you please come with me?

42:56.660 --> 42:57.661
Yeah.

42:57.694 --> 42:59.362
Does eight o'clock work?

42:59.396 --> 43:00.597
Yeah, I'd love to pick you up.

43:00.630 --> 43:02.065
Thank you so much.

43:02.098 --> 43:04.701
All right, I will see
you at eight tomorrow.

43:04.734 --> 43:06.369
All right, I love you.

43:06.403 --> 43:07.103
Love you too honey,

43:07.137 --> 43:08.839
- sweet dreams.
- See you then.

43:08.872 --> 43:09.840
You too.

43:09.873 --> 43:11.575
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye-bye.

43:11.608 --> 43:12.776
Bye.

43:23.753 --> 43:25.922
Bruce is not doing
as well as we hoped.

43:27.791 --> 43:29.526
For another wise healthy man,

43:30.527 --> 43:32.762
this really seems to be
taking a toll on him.

43:34.931 --> 43:36.433
We're doing everything
that we can,

43:36.466 --> 43:38.835
but he still seems
to be failing.

43:41.137 --> 43:41.972
Failing?

43:43.807 --> 43:46.843
What, what does
that mean exactly?

43:49.479 --> 43:51.681
I fear that he may
be giving up the fight.

43:52.883 --> 43:56.953
I think what he needs most
right now, is all of you.

43:56.987 --> 44:01.558
So please, do everything
you can to encourage him.

44:01.591 --> 44:02.893
The positive energy will help.

44:05.795 --> 44:07.864
I don't know if you're
religious or spiritual,

44:07.898 --> 44:11.101
and I certainly don't mean
to offend anybody but,

44:12.068 --> 44:14.571
you may wanna consider praying.

44:14.604 --> 44:15.772
We all may just need that.

44:17.707 --> 44:18.742
Oh God!

44:18.775 --> 44:20.076
Please doctor!

44:21.478 --> 44:24.114
Please do what you
can to save him!

44:25.682 --> 44:27.450
I think you may
also wanna just try

44:27.484 --> 44:29.853
being as close to him
as possible right now.

44:29.886 --> 44:31.688
Now, you won't be able
to see him personally

44:31.721 --> 44:32.689
because he's in quarantine,

44:32.722 --> 44:36.726
but through your phone
and do whatever you can

44:36.760 --> 44:38.695
to help him feel
that connection.

44:40.897 --> 44:43.800
We're doing the best that
we can for him right now.

44:43.833 --> 44:46.603
And I think what's best for you

44:46.636 --> 44:48.939
is to stay home as
much as possible.

44:50.874 --> 44:52.709
Now Laura, I understand
that you've been

44:52.742 --> 44:55.712
tested for the virus and
you were negative, correct?

44:55.745 --> 44:57.981
Yes, but I haven't been tested

44:58.014 --> 44:59.783
since he's been in the hospital,

44:59.816 --> 45:02.118
but I don't have any symptoms.

45:03.053 --> 45:04.587
Okay, and you?

45:05.588 --> 45:06.222
Yes.

45:07.557 --> 45:10.794
James, my husband and the girls,

45:11.828 --> 45:14.197
Allie and Sarah and I
have all been tested

45:14.230 --> 45:16.267
and we're clear.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.268
Very good.

45:17.301 --> 45:20.737
Now, just continue to
take every precaution

45:20.770 --> 45:25.141
and please, stay in touch
with Bruce through your phone,

45:25.175 --> 45:27.510
through video chat.

45:27.544 --> 45:29.579
Whatever you can to help

45:29.612 --> 45:31.848
him feel positive.

45:31.881 --> 45:32.916
We'll keep praying.

45:35.719 --> 45:37.187
Thank you doctor.

45:46.330 --> 45:47.831
Hey.

45:47.864 --> 45:49.499
You want me to drive?

46:03.780 --> 46:04.614
What?

46:06.249 --> 46:09.320
I don't think I wanna be at
the house alone for a while.

46:09.353 --> 46:11.187
And I, I don't wanna
deal with those

46:11.221 --> 46:12.756
reporters if I have to either.

46:12.789 --> 46:14.624
All right.

46:14.657 --> 46:17.328
You know you can stay with
us for as long as you like.

46:17.361 --> 46:19.829
I know the girls would
love to have you stay.

46:22.699 --> 46:23.867
What about James?

46:25.068 --> 46:29.005
Let me take care of him.
Happy wife, happy life, right?

46:30.807 --> 46:31.641
Yeah.

46:35.845 --> 46:37.814
Oh, let me
help you with that.

46:38.681 --> 46:39.749
Thank you.

46:39.783 --> 46:40.617
Hi James.

46:42.218 --> 46:44.621
Mom's going to be staying
with us for a little while.

46:44.654 --> 46:46.257
Just until Dad can come home.

46:48.224 --> 46:49.192
Great!

46:49.225 --> 46:50.327
Grandma!

46:50.361 --> 46:52.028
Hey sweeties, how are you?

46:52.062 --> 46:53.696
Grandma's going
to be staying with

46:53.730 --> 46:54.898
us for a little while.

46:54.931 --> 46:56.800
And Grandpa too?

46:56.833 --> 46:59.135
No sweetie, Grandpa's
still in the hospital.

46:59.169 --> 47:00.904
How is Grandpa doing?

47:00.937 --> 47:02.705
We'll talk about
that in a little while.

47:02.739 --> 47:04.707
Why don't you two
take Grandma upstairs

47:04.741 --> 47:06.776
so she can get settled in, okay?

47:06.810 --> 47:07.644
Let's go girls.

47:07.677 --> 47:08.578
Come on Grandma!

47:09.712 --> 47:10.713
Go girls!

47:13.249 --> 47:15.819
James, will you take the
luggage upstairs, please?

47:15.852 --> 47:17.288
How long is she
gonna be here for?

47:17.321 --> 47:19.956
I don't know, I guess
it depends on Dad.

47:22.092 --> 47:23.760
So it could be a while?

47:23.793 --> 47:26.729
James, please, take
the luggage upstairs.

47:26.763 --> 47:28.932
I don't have the energy
to do this right now!

47:41.744 --> 47:43.146
Yes Bruce.

47:43.179 --> 47:45.014
Staying with Naomi
right now at the house.

47:45.048 --> 47:47.016
You know what honey, I'm
dealing with so much right now

47:47.050 --> 47:49.853
I think it's best
if I'm with family.

47:49.886 --> 47:51.322
And Ally and Sarah love me here.

47:52.755 --> 47:54.325
So how long are
you gonna be there?

47:54.358 --> 47:55.992
If I don't get better soon,

47:56.025 --> 47:58.128
you may be there a while.

47:58.161 --> 48:00.997
The doctor says my lungs
are not doing good.

48:01.030 --> 48:02.732
I may be coming
down with pneumonia.

48:02.765 --> 48:04.734
So I better get out of here soon

48:04.767 --> 48:07.070
or you may be there a long time.

48:07.103 --> 48:08.305
Bruce, don't say that.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.008
That's the last thing I wanna
hear from you right now.

48:12.041 --> 48:14.911
And you gotta stop worrying
about other people.

48:14.944 --> 48:16.813
You know Laura,
I've had a lot of time

48:16.846 --> 48:18.315
to think since
I've been in here.

48:19.883 --> 48:24.888
And I can't help but feel
responsible for Dad's death.

48:25.356 --> 48:27.724
Baby, this is not your fault!

48:28.325 --> 48:30.693
You know, if we hadn't
gone to visit him,

48:31.861 --> 48:33.663
he may still be here today.

48:34.831 --> 48:38.101
You did not kill your
Dad, the virus did!

48:38.134 --> 48:39.303
You understand?

48:40.236 --> 48:42.705
You've gotta quit
thinking that way babe.

48:42.739 --> 48:45.808
You didn't plan on
having this illness!

48:45.842 --> 48:47.076
And we sure didn't know you were

48:47.110 --> 48:49.112
gonna have it when
we went to visit him.

48:50.046 --> 48:53.016
So quit feeling the
guilt for Max, okay?

48:53.983 --> 48:54.984
You need to stop saying that

48:55.018 --> 48:57.187
and start thinking
about yourself.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.289
Do you understand me?

48:59.290 --> 49:00.990
Happy wife, happy life.

49:03.159 --> 49:04.160
That's right baby.

49:06.330 --> 49:08.865
You have a lot of life
left to live Bruce.

49:09.766 --> 49:12.902
All right, and I just
need you to look up

49:12.936 --> 49:15.439
and remember that everyone's
going through change.

49:15.472 --> 49:18.141
All of us are going through
so much change right now.

49:19.242 --> 49:20.076
Okay?

49:22.313 --> 49:23.146
Yeah.

49:25.215 --> 49:29.320
Just know we are praying
for you Bruce Gunther.

49:29.353 --> 49:31.087
I can't have you
give up right now.

49:32.188 --> 49:33.823
I love you.

49:33.856 --> 49:35.925
Now go get some rest,

49:35.959 --> 49:37.294
and I'll talk to you later.

49:38.228 --> 49:39.162
I love you too.

49:42.799 --> 49:43.833
Mom?

49:44.867 --> 49:46.169
Hey honey, good morning.

49:47.538 --> 49:49.340
I made you some coffee.

49:49.373 --> 49:50.873
I could use it right now.

49:50.907 --> 49:51.741
Yeah.

49:53.042 --> 49:54.777
So, how's Dad?

49:59.849 --> 50:01.418
You up for a walk?

50:02.386 --> 50:03.219
Sure.

50:04.988 --> 50:06.089
Let's go.

50:06.122 --> 50:07.824
Okay.

50:07.857 --> 50:09.025
Thank you so much for bringing

50:09.058 --> 50:10.760
those extra rolls
of toilet paper.

50:12.363 --> 50:13.796
We could always use it,

50:13.830 --> 50:15.432
especially with it
being so hard to find.

50:15.466 --> 50:17.867
- I know, ridiculous.
- Oh geeze.

50:18.868 --> 50:20.036
And hey,
you came out with

50:20.069 --> 50:21.871
some extra hand sanitizer too.

50:23.474 --> 50:25.808
We're not bartering
again now are we?

50:29.212 --> 50:30.347
What's wrong?

50:32.849 --> 50:34.585
Just thinking about your Dad.

50:38.589 --> 50:39.889
I don't know.

50:41.358 --> 50:42.393
I don't know,

50:42.426 --> 50:43.826
I just don't wanna lose him.

50:46.363 --> 50:47.431
No.

50:47.464 --> 50:49.400
He's gonna be fine Mom.

50:50.567 --> 50:52.369
What do you
think we should do?

50:52.403 --> 50:53.036
Just keep praying right?

50:53.069 --> 50:54.971
All we can do is wait now.

50:58.309 --> 50:59.543
You think so?

50:59.576 --> 51:00.544
Yeah, I think so.

51:03.112 --> 51:04.113
Mom, sit down.

51:05.649 --> 51:08.851
It just seems like
everybody's doing all right.

51:13.557 --> 51:15.058
Hey.

51:15.091 --> 51:18.127
Do you remember that
time when I was little

51:19.162 --> 51:21.030
and we were at the lake

51:21.064 --> 51:23.567
and that goose chased
me all around the lake?

51:26.270 --> 51:27.236
I do remember it.

51:27.271 --> 51:29.038
I remember that goose

51:29.072 --> 51:30.374
was as big as you were, right?

51:32.643 --> 51:35.912
But he chased all
around the picnic tables

51:35.945 --> 51:39.882
and oh, I had to dump a
trail of crackers behind me.

51:39.916 --> 51:42.519
And you were laughing so hard.

51:43.587 --> 51:46.623
Honey, I remember that
like it was yesterday.

51:48.157 --> 51:50.059
I was laughing,
but you know why,

51:50.093 --> 51:52.028
also because your Dad,

51:52.061 --> 51:55.198
your Dad like ran
and he was chasing

51:55.231 --> 51:56.600
the goose into the lake.

51:57.568 --> 51:58.502
You know he fell in!

51:59.603 --> 52:02.105
He was soaked and we
couldn't dry him off!

52:02.138 --> 52:03.273
It was hilarious.

52:04.140 --> 52:07.176
It was hilarious as the wind.

52:07.210 --> 52:09.946
Oh, he's always
been my protector.

52:14.685 --> 52:15.586
How are you doing Mom?

52:19.155 --> 52:19.989
Well,

52:20.923 --> 52:24.361
nobody's really asked
me that until now.

52:24.395 --> 52:27.230
It's just like, I'm trying
to keep it together because

52:28.399 --> 52:30.032
your Dad has to be strong

52:30.066 --> 52:32.569
and I'm trying to make
sure he's positive.

52:32.603 --> 52:35.406
So I just keep encouraging him.

52:36.273 --> 52:37.940
I guess I'm doing okay.

52:37.974 --> 52:40.209
Just trying to keep
your Dad positive.

52:40.243 --> 52:41.612
You know what I mean?

52:41.645 --> 52:42.479
Yeah.

52:43.480 --> 52:47.016
I don't know what I'm
gonna do if I lose him.

52:47.049 --> 52:49.620
I can't lose him Naomi, I can't.

52:49.653 --> 52:51.688
At least your Dad is...

52:51.722 --> 52:52.955
Oh Mom.

52:56.993 --> 53:01.063
You have always been the
strong one in our family.

53:01.097 --> 53:02.299
I won't crumble.

53:02.332 --> 53:03.600
I'm gonna stay strong.

53:07.604 --> 53:09.440
I'm gonna stay strong.

53:11.073 --> 53:12.409
Let's go home.

53:15.712 --> 53:17.246
Okay.

53:17.281 --> 53:19.683
Come on, let's go see the kids.

53:23.387 --> 53:24.388
All right.

53:27.123 --> 53:28.592
Shall we pray?

53:28.625 --> 53:29.660
Yes.

53:32.396 --> 53:35.599
Heavenly Father, we
thank You for this food

53:35.632 --> 53:38.167
and the souls it will refresh.

53:38.201 --> 53:40.771
We also thank you for
bringing us all together.

53:40.804 --> 53:43.172
And dear Lord, we
pray for Bruce.

53:43.206 --> 53:45.742
We ask that You
restore his health

53:45.776 --> 53:48.512
and bring him back stronger
than he was before.

53:48.545 --> 53:50.647
With this, we ask You Lord,

53:50.681 --> 53:52.349
praise be to God.

53:52.382 --> 53:53.684
Amen.

53:53.717 --> 53:55.786
- Amen.
- Amen.

53:55.819 --> 53:57.421
Amen, let's eat.

53:59.055 --> 54:01.558
You will wait your
turn little lady!

54:01.592 --> 54:03.125
Yes ma'am.

54:03.993 --> 54:06.697
This is not
funny either Sarah.

54:06.730 --> 54:08.532
Yeah, it's not funny!

54:08.565 --> 54:09.333
Mom!

54:09.366 --> 54:12.034
Both of you stop
it, right now!

54:12.068 --> 54:13.169
Do you hear me?

54:17.441 --> 54:19.676
I know we've all
been a little tense

54:19.710 --> 54:22.312
being in this house
for so much time.

54:23.547 --> 54:24.781
With James working from home,

54:24.815 --> 54:27.618
and the girls are
out of school...

54:27.651 --> 54:29.453
And now that
you're here Laura,

54:29.486 --> 54:31.588
we definitely have a full house.

54:32.756 --> 54:34.358
I don't wanna be a burden.

54:36.225 --> 54:38.495
Mom, you are not a burden!

54:38.529 --> 54:40.664
We love having you here.

54:40.697 --> 54:42.733
Don't we, James?

54:42.766 --> 54:44.601
Yes.

54:44.635 --> 54:45.636
Yes we do.

54:45.669 --> 54:47.538
We sure do Grandma.

54:47.571 --> 54:49.439
You stay here as
long as you want.

54:49.473 --> 54:50.541
Thank you sweetie.

54:51.608 --> 54:54.143
Is everyone gonna be okay?

54:54.176 --> 54:55.546
What do you mean?

54:55.579 --> 54:56.680
None of us are sick.

54:57.781 --> 55:01.117
No, I mean financially.

55:02.252 --> 55:03.420
I'm still working.

55:03.453 --> 55:05.087
At least for now.

55:05.121 --> 55:07.858
Obviously the economy
took a big hit!

55:07.891 --> 55:10.394
And we're basically
all in chaos right now

55:10.427 --> 55:11.662
because of the virus!

55:13.129 --> 55:13.764
You know,

55:15.399 --> 55:18.200
everybody is so
frightened of this virus,

55:18.234 --> 55:21.338
but we're gonna fix
this and move on!

55:22.573 --> 55:24.173
You know,

55:24.206 --> 55:26.777
fear is gonna be our new enemy.

55:28.210 --> 55:29.646
This will soon pass,

55:29.680 --> 55:31.815
as long as this fear
doesn't bring us all down.

55:32.783 --> 55:34.751
Is fear gonna get me?

55:34.785 --> 55:37.654
No stupid, fear's
gonna get me.

55:39.221 --> 55:40.757
Oh no, Mom!

55:40.791 --> 55:41.725
Mommy!

55:41.758 --> 55:43.192
Stop, right now!

55:44.361 --> 55:45.696
And if you don't stop it,

55:46.797 --> 55:49.600
you're gonna go straight
to bed, understand?

55:51.335 --> 55:53.637
And you, Sarah,

55:53.670 --> 55:54.871
don't scare your sister.

55:55.806 --> 55:56.640
Yes sir.

55:59.543 --> 56:01.177
I'm afraid.

56:01.210 --> 56:02.779
What's happening?

56:02.813 --> 56:06.650
Ally, there's a virus going
around the world right now.

56:06.683 --> 56:08.418
Like the flu.

56:09.720 --> 56:13.590
And we don't know
what it's all about,

56:13.624 --> 56:17.694
but there are big people
working on it right now.

56:17.728 --> 56:19.563
And it'll soon be over.

56:19.596 --> 56:20.430
You understand?

56:21.765 --> 56:24.233
Like when my kitten died?

56:27.404 --> 56:29.773
Well, sorta like that.

56:29.806 --> 56:31.842
I don't want my
Grandpa to die!

56:31.875 --> 56:34.745
Honey, Grandpa
will be just fine.

56:35.812 --> 56:39.248
Just pray to God and let
God take care of Grandpa.

56:39.282 --> 56:39.916
Okay?

56:42.452 --> 56:43.086
I know.

56:43.954 --> 56:45.689
I think it'll be good for Dad

56:45.722 --> 56:49.225
if we all got together for
some FaceTime tomorrow.

56:49.259 --> 56:49.860
What do you think Mom?

56:49.893 --> 56:51.695
I think that'd be nice.

56:51.728 --> 56:52.529
Yeah.

56:52.562 --> 56:54.364
Your Father would
love to see you.

56:55.265 --> 56:56.366
And the kids.

57:06.009 --> 57:07.911
How are you
feeling this morning Bruce?

57:09.513 --> 57:10.747
I feel like this.

57:14.451 --> 57:15.786
It's
okay, take your time.

57:15.819 --> 57:18.689
Let me know what's going on.

57:18.722 --> 57:20.424
Something crushing my chest.

57:23.560 --> 57:24.961
I see.

57:26.930 --> 57:28.565
I can't

57:28.598 --> 57:30.634
get enough air in my lungs.

57:31.968 --> 57:32.769
Sounds
like maybe you're

57:32.803 --> 57:34.705
developing some
fluid in your lungs.

57:35.972 --> 57:37.641
I think we need to get some
more antibiotics in him,

57:37.674 --> 57:40.277
and let's make 'em a
little bit stronger.

57:40.310 --> 57:41.712
Yes doctor.

57:41.745 --> 57:44.246
Bruce, you
gotta keep fighting, okay?

57:44.281 --> 57:45.682
I'll come check on you tomorrow.

57:46.750 --> 57:47.684
Thank you doctor.

57:48.785 --> 57:49.619
Keep fighting!

58:03.633 --> 58:05.669
When's the last time
we updated the family?

58:05.702 --> 58:07.704
I believe it was
yesterday doctor.

58:09.706 --> 58:10.974
It's just a matter of time.

58:12.709 --> 58:14.678
Let's hope these meds work
harder than that virus.

58:14.711 --> 58:15.812
Right.

58:15.846 --> 58:16.847
Thank you.

58:20.917 --> 58:22.853
Hi Naomi.

58:22.886 --> 58:24.654
We miss you hun!

58:24.688 --> 58:26.790
We sure do Grandpa.

58:26.823 --> 58:29.793
When are you getting
out of the hospital?

58:30.761 --> 58:31.728
I'm not sure sweetie.

58:33.096 --> 58:34.765
I'm really sick.

58:36.967 --> 58:38.835
I wish I was with you all.

58:39.836 --> 58:41.571
You are with us Dad.

58:41.605 --> 58:43.673
You will always be with us.

58:43.707 --> 58:46.009
We love you Grandpa.

58:46.042 --> 58:47.944
I love you too Sarah.

58:47.978 --> 58:48.645
And all of you.

58:48.678 --> 58:51.381
Has the doctor seen you today?

58:51.414 --> 58:55.051
Yes, and he seems concerned.

58:55.085 --> 58:55.986
What did he say?

58:57.754 --> 58:58.922
Look, I don't wanna,

58:58.955 --> 59:01.758
I don't wanna mess
things up for you guys,

59:01.792 --> 59:03.927
but I think there's
a pretty good chance

59:03.960 --> 59:05.695
I'm not gonna make
it through this.

59:06.763 --> 59:09.366
You listen to
me Bruce Gunther,

59:10.801 --> 59:13.703
you have never
given up on anything

59:13.737 --> 59:16.473
and I'm not about to
let you start now!

59:17.440 --> 59:19.442
I'm sorry Laura.

59:19.476 --> 59:20.510
Sorry for what?

59:21.745 --> 59:23.680
You don't have to apologize.

59:25.649 --> 59:28.451
You remember what you told me?

59:28.485 --> 59:30.987
We work together for those

59:31.021 --> 59:33.957
who were called according
to His purpose babe.

59:35.659 --> 59:39.663
And it's His purpose
that you live.

59:40.564 --> 59:43.767
And you know what,
you have a purpose.

59:45.569 --> 59:47.637
And you will pull through!

59:49.840 --> 59:51.441
We need you.

59:51.474 --> 59:52.709
We do need you.

59:52.742 --> 59:54.678
There's so many
more ducks to feed!

59:57.514 --> 59:58.748
I'm sorry.

59:58.782 --> 01:00:02.652
I can't talk very
well right now.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.555
We'll try to talk very soon.

01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:06.823
I love you all.

01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:08.859
We love you too.

01:00:15.832 --> 01:00:18.068
I think I need to be
alone for a while guys.

01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:18.935
Mom.

01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:24.507
So how's your Mom doing?

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.742
I don't know.

01:00:25.775 --> 01:00:28.044
I think she's still sleeping.

01:00:28.078 --> 01:00:30.513
She was up in her
room all night.

01:00:35.685 --> 01:00:36.720
And how are you doing?

01:00:37.854 --> 01:00:39.923
As well as anyone can be.

01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:41.658
Under the circumstances.

01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:43.760
You know, I sure
hope this is over soon.

01:00:44.694 --> 01:00:47.697
I'm ready to get out of
this house, return to work.

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:51.902
It seems like we're doing
everything online now.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.672
Ironic really.

01:00:55.705 --> 01:00:57.207
Our reality has
virtually stopped

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.111
and it's been replaced
with virtual reality.

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.416
And I'm ready to get
our lives back together.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:10.520
How much longer is your Mom
gonna be staying with us?

01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:13.523
I don't know James, why?

01:01:13.556 --> 01:01:15.158
Is that a problem?

01:01:15.191 --> 01:01:16.092
A problem?

01:01:16.126 --> 01:01:17.861
We already enough
people in this house!

01:01:19.195 --> 01:01:22.065
Naomi look, I love your Mother,

01:01:23.566 --> 01:01:25.502
I'm just anxious to
get our house back!

01:01:36.579 --> 01:01:37.213
Ally?

01:01:38.815 --> 01:01:40.016
Who was at the front door?

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.151
Grandma.

01:01:41.184 --> 01:01:42.886
Did she say where
she was going?

01:01:46.723 --> 01:01:47.757
What?

01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:49.793
Thank you!

01:01:49.826 --> 01:01:51.661
You're welcome.

01:01:51.695 --> 01:01:53.596
Ally, be quiet!

01:01:56.833 --> 01:01:58.635
Where on earth
could she be going?

01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:01.604
And she left her phone.

01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:30.066
Sorry Father.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.068
I didn't know you were there.

01:02:32.102 --> 01:02:34.170
I didn't realize
the door was unlocked.

01:02:35.805 --> 01:02:37.707
I just needed some
time to be alone.

01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:40.910
Are we ever really alone?

01:02:42.112 --> 01:02:44.748
Social distancing in its
purest form isn't it?

01:02:46.182 --> 01:02:47.017
Excuse me?

01:02:48.952 --> 01:02:51.221
Would you like to sit?

01:02:52.188 --> 01:02:53.857
I would enjoy the company Laura,

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.725
that is, if you're up to it.

01:02:56.893 --> 01:02:58.061
Thank you Father.

01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:09.072
God is always with us,

01:03:09.105 --> 01:03:10.707
and I've had a lot
of talks with Him

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.875
in the last few days.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:15.845
But it would be nice to speak

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.747
with someone I can actually see.

01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:21.885
It's hard sometimes
to know what God's

01:03:21.918 --> 01:03:23.086
plan or purpose is.

01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:28.858
And we as mortals, often find
that purpose hard to accept.

01:03:30.327 --> 01:03:33.696
We must put our trust
and faith in Him,

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.899
no matter how
difficult that may be.

01:03:37.867 --> 01:03:40.003
Why do you suppose
God inflicts pain

01:03:40.036 --> 01:03:41.805
on those that follow His word,

01:03:41.838 --> 01:03:44.941
but allows people that
don't follow His word

01:03:44.974 --> 01:03:46.643
to run free?

01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:50.314
A question for the ages.

01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:52.849
Why do you imagine He allowed

01:03:52.882 --> 01:03:56.653
so much pain and suffering
to be inflicted on Jesus?

01:03:58.721 --> 01:03:59.756
Did He not love Him?

01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:03.960
The true test of faith is not

01:04:03.993 --> 01:04:06.763
what we do when times are good,

01:04:07.997 --> 01:04:10.834
but what we do in
times of despair.

01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:14.771
This too shall pass.

01:04:15.872 --> 01:04:18.875
As everything in this
world has come and gone,

01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:22.313
and so it will be
with this pandemic.

01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:27.418
I don't wanna go
on without Bruce.

01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:29.353
I can assure you,

01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:32.256
the world will go
on in God's time.

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:35.658
Whether or not Bruce, you, or I

01:04:35.692 --> 01:04:36.527
are here to witness it.

01:04:37.861 --> 01:04:40.864
Through everything
there is a purpose.

01:04:41.931 --> 01:04:43.933
You take care of yourself

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.270
and those things you can control

01:04:46.303 --> 01:04:49.005
and let God take care
of everything else.

01:04:50.073 --> 01:04:51.941
I can also assure you,

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:56.179
He has things in control,

01:04:56.212 --> 01:04:58.349
and He is with
Bruce as we speak.

01:05:00.884 --> 01:05:01.818
Thank you Father.

01:05:02.852 --> 01:05:04.421
I appreciate your time.

01:05:06.089 --> 01:05:07.324
As I do yours.

01:05:14.864 --> 01:05:15.899
Excuse me.

01:05:18.201 --> 01:05:19.370
Do I know you?

01:05:21.905 --> 01:05:24.807
I don't think so, who are you?

01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:26.876
I do know you.

01:05:28.445 --> 01:05:33.183
You're that woman on TV whose
husband has coronavirus.

01:05:33.216 --> 01:05:36.219
Do you know how much jeopardy

01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:38.121
he has put all of us in?

01:05:38.154 --> 01:05:40.190
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

01:05:41.057 --> 01:05:43.927
He was supposed to stay
home and self-quarantine,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.763
but instead, you guys
were out running around!

01:05:46.796 --> 01:05:47.665
We could all be sick!

01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:49.300
Who knows how many
people could be sick

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:51.435
because of you people!

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:52.802
Just stop that!

01:05:52.835 --> 01:05:54.305
No, you stop!

01:05:54.338 --> 01:05:55.272
Shut up!

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.474
You listen to me!

01:05:59.075 --> 01:06:00.743
Do you realize

01:06:00.777 --> 01:06:04.080
my husband didn't ask for this.

01:06:04.113 --> 01:06:04.981
Do you realize that?

01:06:05.014 --> 01:06:06.317
And I don't think
he'd wanna go around

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.420
infecting everybody,
let alone himself!

01:06:09.453 --> 01:06:11.955
He would not do that to anyone.

01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:15.925
Now my family and I are
struggling a lot right now,

01:06:15.959 --> 01:06:18.995
and there's a possibility
that he may die!

01:06:19.028 --> 01:06:21.197
We don't need your ignorance.

01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:23.766
Ladies, please.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.869
We are in God's house.

01:06:26.903 --> 01:06:29.540
Father, let me handle this!

01:06:29.573 --> 01:06:32.041
And you, don't even have

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:34.143
any empathy for a human being?

01:06:34.177 --> 01:06:35.346
Lady!

01:06:35.379 --> 01:06:36.879
I mean seriously!

01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:39.816
Look where we are.

01:06:39.849 --> 01:06:42.986
We're at a church
for God's sake!

01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:46.390
Do you realize that?

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:56.500
I have looked
everywhere James.

01:06:56.533 --> 01:06:58.167
Have you checked
the house yet?

01:06:58.201 --> 01:07:00.203
Yes, I've checked her house.

01:07:00.236 --> 01:07:01.505
I even looked in the windows

01:07:01.538 --> 01:07:03.840
in case her car
was in the garage,

01:07:03.873 --> 01:07:05.808
and she's not there either!

01:07:05.842 --> 01:07:07.010
This is crazy!

01:07:08.279 --> 01:07:09.580
Everywhere is closed.

01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:12.549
There are so many
places she could be.

01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:13.983
So help me James,

01:07:14.017 --> 01:07:15.885
if anything happens to her...

01:07:16.553 --> 01:07:17.554
Oh my God!

01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:21.858
Naomi!

01:07:21.891 --> 01:07:23.494
Naomi!

01:07:23.527 --> 01:07:25.194
Naomi are you there!

01:07:26.397 --> 01:07:27.196
Naomi!

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.164
I'm okay.

01:07:31.535 --> 01:07:33.236
I'm here, I'm gonna
come home now.

01:07:40.943 --> 01:07:42.279
Mom!

01:07:42.313 --> 01:07:43.246
Hi honey.

01:07:44.247 --> 01:07:45.349
Thank God.

01:07:46.983 --> 01:07:48.084
Where have you been?

01:07:48.117 --> 01:07:50.853
I have been looking
all over for you!

01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:55.526
I'm okay.

01:07:55.559 --> 01:07:58.895
I woulda called but,
someone forgot her phone.

01:07:58.928 --> 01:07:59.996
Yes you did.

01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:01.030
I was frantic!

01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:03.467
Don't ever do that to me again!

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.402
I thought something
had happened to you,

01:08:05.436 --> 01:08:08.905
then I thought, she just went
to go see Dad at the hospital.

01:08:09.939 --> 01:08:12.141
Sorry to upset you Naomi.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:13.910
I just wanted to get alone

01:08:13.943 --> 01:08:15.546
and have some time to think.

01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:18.381
And they're not letting
me see your Father anyway.

01:08:18.415 --> 01:08:20.384
And I didn't have my
phone to call him.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:22.952
Did the doctor call?

01:08:22.984 --> 01:08:23.920
No.

01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:25.188
Where's my phone?

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.457
It's on the counter
in the kitchen.

01:08:27.491 --> 01:08:28.325
Okay.

01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:32.395
Why?

01:08:33.996 --> 01:08:35.666
I don't know, I'm just

01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:36.567
so upset right now,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.868
I just really wanna
talk to your Dad.

01:08:40.404 --> 01:08:41.871
I need to see your Dad.

01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:45.642
Look, I'm gonna give him a call.

01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:49.645
Okay.

01:08:57.953 --> 01:08:59.323
He's not answering.

01:08:59.356 --> 01:09:01.258
He's probably asleep.

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:02.992
Try again tomorrow.

01:09:03.694 --> 01:09:05.928
Well it's great to
have you home Mom.

01:09:05.962 --> 01:09:07.398
Isn't it, James?

01:09:09.433 --> 01:09:13.303
Laura, I know I said
some horrible things

01:09:13.337 --> 01:09:16.104
both to you and about you,

01:09:16.139 --> 01:09:18.140
but I think we
can all agree that

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:22.145
there's a lot of tension in
this household right now.

01:09:23.313 --> 01:09:24.648
And above all that,

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.550
I'm truly sorry
about what I said

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:30.953
and I would love it if you
would accept my apology.

01:09:32.988 --> 01:09:35.057
It's okay James.

01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:36.693
It's been hard on all of us.

01:09:39.462 --> 01:09:40.330
Where are the kids?

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:41.631
They're upstairs.

01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:45.001
I'm just gonna
go see the girls.

01:09:45.033 --> 01:09:45.669
Okay.

01:09:53.544 --> 01:09:54.545
Good morning Mom.

01:09:54.578 --> 01:09:56.212
Good morning honey.

01:09:56.245 --> 01:09:58.482
Been trying to call your
Dad but he's not answering.

01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:02.519
He's probably still sleeping.

01:10:02.553 --> 01:10:04.187
It is early.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.989
Yeah, you're right.

01:10:07.023 --> 01:10:08.692
That's the doctor now, hold on.

01:10:10.761 --> 01:10:11.961
Good morning doctor.

01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:16.165
Okay.

01:10:19.703 --> 01:10:23.139
I know you're trying.

01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:24.240
It's not good though.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:27.811
Okay.

01:10:28.712 --> 01:10:30.714
All right, thank you doctor.

01:10:33.049 --> 01:10:33.684
Mom!

01:10:34.718 --> 01:10:35.752
Mom, what is it?

01:10:39.121 --> 01:10:39.756
Mom, what?

01:10:43.393 --> 01:10:44.761
Mom, what is it, tell me?

01:10:46.095 --> 01:10:47.631
He just,

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:50.501
he told me that your
Dad's not improving.

01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:53.069
He just didn't sound optimistic.

01:10:53.102 --> 01:10:54.771
Honey, I need to
get out of here.

01:10:55.606 --> 01:10:56.440
Mom.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:10:58.642
Don't do this to me again.

01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:01.678
Honey, I just need to go!

01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:05.214
Okay.

01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:08.685
Listen, will you
let me take Allie

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:10.587
and Sarah to the park?

01:11:10.621 --> 01:11:12.021
Like your Father used to do?

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:15.726
Yes, take them.

01:11:15.759 --> 01:11:17.794
But be back before dinner,

01:11:17.828 --> 01:11:20.196
and only go to the park.

01:11:22.599 --> 01:11:24.233
Okay, promise.

01:11:24.268 --> 01:11:25.101
Okay.

01:11:25.836 --> 01:11:27.371
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:35.177
Oh, and
one more thing,

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.648
take your phone with you.

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:41.351
It's right here.

01:12:26.797 --> 01:12:29.566
Those ducks are
hungry Grandma.

01:12:32.402 --> 01:12:33.202
They are.

01:12:33.235 --> 01:12:34.504
Do you miss Grandpa?

01:12:35.739 --> 01:12:36.573
I do Sarah.

01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:40.176
I remember he used
to feed the ducks.

01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:42.679
So do I.

01:12:42.713 --> 01:12:44.881
Do you think he'll be able
to feed the ducks again?

01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:47.451
I sure hope so.

01:12:48.819 --> 01:12:50.687
You know what I think grandma?

01:12:50.721 --> 01:12:52.221
What sweetheart?

01:12:52.255 --> 01:12:54.725
I think Grandpa's
gonna be just fine.

01:12:54.758 --> 01:12:57.327
You know why he's
gonna be just fine?

01:12:57.361 --> 01:12:58.362
Why honey?

01:12:59.363 --> 01:13:01.698
'Cause there's still
too many ducks to feed.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.334
I agree.

01:13:05.636 --> 01:13:07.571
All the ducks are
done eating now,

01:13:07.604 --> 01:13:08.905
it's our turn to eat.

01:13:10.307 --> 01:13:11.675
All right, let's
go eat all right.

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:12.743
Okay.

01:13:13.744 --> 01:13:14.811
Come on kids.

01:14:15.639 --> 01:14:17.340
Mom, I think
that's your phone.

01:14:20.877 --> 01:14:21.845
He hung up.

01:14:21.878 --> 01:14:22.679
Who?

01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:23.747
The doctor.

01:14:25.582 --> 01:14:26.850
Maybe you should
call him back.

01:14:26.883 --> 01:14:27.951
Shh!

01:14:27.984 --> 01:14:29.453
What?

01:14:29.486 --> 01:14:30.687
Maybe you should
call him back.

01:14:30.721 --> 01:14:33.557
Sounds like a
great idea to me!

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:34.391
Shut up!

01:14:36.526 --> 01:14:38.361
Well I'm afraid
it'll be bad news.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.031
But I thought he
said he wouldn't

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:43.700
call you with bad news.

01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:44.701
He did this morning

01:14:44.735 --> 01:14:47.971
and he could ask me to
come into the office.

01:14:48.004 --> 01:14:49.706
Did he leave a message?

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.907
No.

01:14:50.941 --> 01:14:53.710
Well, you're never gonna
know unless you call him back.

01:14:53.744 --> 01:14:54.711
Oh, James, stop it!

01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:55.712
Ugh!

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:56.813
Mom, Mom what's wrong?

01:14:59.082 --> 01:14:59.916
Well.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.689
You know what, I'm
just gonna call him.

01:15:11.962 --> 01:15:13.830
Hello, may I speak
to Dr. Bahadura.

01:15:15.332 --> 01:15:16.466
This is Laura Gunther.

01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:20.003
Bruce Gunther, my
husband is your patient.

01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:22.372
Okay.

01:15:22.405 --> 01:15:23.273
All right, thanks.

01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:26.777
They got me on hold.

01:15:28.945 --> 01:15:30.013
Hello, Dr. Bahadura?

01:15:32.716 --> 01:15:33.750
Really?

01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:35.919
Okay great.

01:15:35.952 --> 01:15:36.953
The family's here.

01:15:37.854 --> 01:15:39.356
Can we put you on speaker?

01:15:40.824 --> 01:15:41.658
Okay.

01:15:44.961 --> 01:15:47.063
Well it seems that
we've had a bit of a,

01:15:47.097 --> 01:15:48.665
how should I say this.

01:15:48.698 --> 01:15:50.000
A surprise this afternoon.

01:15:52.702 --> 01:15:54.604
Looks like Bruce is
gonna pull through.

01:15:54.638 --> 01:15:55.539
Yes!

01:15:55.572 --> 01:15:56.673
Thank God!

01:15:56.706 --> 01:15:59.609
- He's recovering!
- Yay!

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:00.744
Finally!

01:16:00.777 --> 01:16:03.346
Dr. Bahadura,
can you hear this?

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.681
Yes I can.

01:16:04.714 --> 01:16:06.683
And I'm really happy for ya.

01:16:06.716 --> 01:16:07.951
- Especially Bruce.
- Yay!

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.788
We'll test him
over the next couple of days

01:16:11.822 --> 01:16:14.591
and then, if everything
comes back negative,

01:16:14.624 --> 01:16:16.560
he'll be able to go home then.

01:16:16.593 --> 01:16:18.795
Thank you doctor,
for everything!

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:20.030
Wow.

01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:20.697
- Wow.
- Yes.

01:16:22.732 --> 01:16:25.435
Life back to normal.

01:16:27.938 --> 01:16:30.707
Hello everyone, happy Sunday.

01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:34.945
And welcome to those of
you in our sanctuary,

01:16:34.978 --> 01:16:38.648
and those of you streaming
from a safe place at home.

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:42.953
Today is a special occasion.

01:16:42.986 --> 01:16:44.821
We are celebrating life.

01:16:45.722 --> 01:16:48.058
We are celebrating faith.

01:16:48.091 --> 01:16:52.128
And we are celebrating
the power of God.

01:16:52.162 --> 01:16:54.564
We have a special guest here

01:16:54.598 --> 01:16:57.634
who had a pretty interesting,

01:16:57.667 --> 01:17:01.137
almost fatal experience
with the COVI-19 virus.

01:17:02.105 --> 01:17:04.908
I'm very very happy
to introduce to you

01:17:04.941 --> 01:17:06.576
Bruce Gunther.

01:17:19.623 --> 01:17:21.558
Thank you very much.

01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:23.960
And even though there are
only a few of you here today,

01:17:24.995 --> 01:17:27.898
and for all of you out
there watching from home,

01:17:27.931 --> 01:17:31.534
we must remember, the
church is not a building,

01:17:32.636 --> 01:17:33.870
but a shared experience.

01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:38.475
That's what I've been
asked to do today.

01:17:38.508 --> 01:17:40.744
Is to share my experience.

01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:45.649
A few weeks after Laura
and I returned from Europe,

01:17:45.682 --> 01:17:48.785
I was diagnosed with
the coronavirus.

01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:52.822
Unfortunately, I passed
this along to my father,

01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:56.159
and even though I made it,
he was not so fortunate.

01:17:57.994 --> 01:18:00.463
My father and I did
not see eye to eye

01:18:00.497 --> 01:18:01.299
for most of my life.

01:18:03.233 --> 01:18:04.834
And things only
became more stressful

01:18:04.868 --> 01:18:06.703
after my Mother died.

01:18:06.736 --> 01:18:08.738
I wasn't able to
attend his funeral,

01:18:09.706 --> 01:18:10.807
but I miss him everyday.

01:18:12.008 --> 01:18:13.810
Dad, if you're listening,

01:18:15.211 --> 01:18:16.780
and I hope that you are Dad,

01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:19.616
I love you.

01:18:27.691 --> 01:18:29.793
This past month
has not been easy,

01:18:29.826 --> 01:18:30.994
for me or my family.

01:18:32.762 --> 01:18:34.597
As well as our
nation and the world.

01:18:35.598 --> 01:18:38.269
A lot of misinformation and
negativity is out there.

01:18:38.302 --> 01:18:39.803
Don't let that scare you,

01:18:41.571 --> 01:18:43.039
because it will
only cause panic,

01:18:43.907 --> 01:18:46.543
and panic right now will
only add to the problem.

01:18:48.011 --> 01:18:49.946
Even in this time of
social distancing,

01:18:51.282 --> 01:18:53.750
we must come together as one!

01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:57.120
We are strongest in this country

01:18:58.188 --> 01:19:01.691
when we have conflicts
and a common enemy.

01:19:01.725 --> 01:19:03.727
And make no mistake about it,

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.895
this virus is our enemy.

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:12.836
America will only ever fail
if we fight amongst ourselves.

01:19:13.803 --> 01:19:16.806
And this is only happened
once in our history.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.975
Please, let's not let
that happen again.

01:19:21.044 --> 01:19:22.746
I won't stand here
and tell you that this

01:19:22.779 --> 01:19:24.981
was not a horrible
experience, because it was.

01:19:26.216 --> 01:19:27.217
But I will tell you

01:19:28.818 --> 01:19:32.055
that my family and
my faith in God

01:19:32.088 --> 01:19:33.290
brought me through this.

01:19:35.025 --> 01:19:37.927
And I love each
of you very much.

01:19:39.996 --> 01:19:40.830
Laura,

01:19:43.933 --> 01:19:44.834
you are my rock.

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:48.805
I know there are those out there

01:19:48.838 --> 01:19:49.939
that think this is a hoax.

01:19:51.007 --> 01:19:53.877
But just like faith, just
because you can't see it

01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:55.312
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:59.082
Be cautious, take precautions,

01:19:59.115 --> 01:20:01.318
and this too will pass.

01:20:01.352 --> 01:20:02.652
Having said that,

01:20:03.753 --> 01:20:04.687
I wanna share something with you

01:20:04.721 --> 01:20:07.090
that I have never shared
with anyone before.

01:20:08.858 --> 01:20:10.894
I haven't even shared
this with my family.

01:20:11.928 --> 01:20:14.331
Only God knows what I'm
about to share with you.

01:20:15.198 --> 01:20:18.234
When I was in the hospital,
on my darkest day,

01:20:18.269 --> 01:20:21.104
lying in that bed,
barely able to breathe,

01:20:22.772 --> 01:20:24.607
all I could see was ducks.

01:20:29.712 --> 01:20:32.048
There were so many ducks,

01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:34.318
and as I lay in bed I
could see my family.

01:20:35.419 --> 01:20:36.953
I could see my grandkids

01:20:37.987 --> 01:20:39.823
playing with and
feeding the ducks.

01:20:41.758 --> 01:20:44.727
Now some of you may think
this is kind of funny,

01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:47.931
but for me, it was the most
important thing in the world.

01:20:49.732 --> 01:20:51.634
You see, because these ducks,

01:20:53.404 --> 01:20:57.740
were always at the lake that
I used to take my family to.

01:20:58.409 --> 01:21:00.311
And when we go to this lake,

01:21:00.344 --> 01:21:03.780
we would have so much
fun, just glorious days

01:21:03.813 --> 01:21:07.817
playing by the water,
fishing, feeding the ducks.

01:21:09.752 --> 01:21:12.122
It was just so
overwhelmingly beautiful.

01:21:13.424 --> 01:21:15.725
And for every duck we fed,

01:21:15.758 --> 01:21:18.194
I just felt like I was
that much more needed.

01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:19.430
And then I would
call Allie and Sarah

01:21:19.463 --> 01:21:21.965
and I would say, "Sarah, come
here, let's feed this duck."

01:21:21.998 --> 01:21:25.269
And when we did,
it made me realize

01:21:25.302 --> 01:21:27.170
how important I was.

01:21:27.203 --> 01:21:30.173
To not only the duck,
but to my granddaughters,

01:21:30.206 --> 01:21:31.674
and my family at home.

01:21:34.177 --> 01:21:36.746
I realized that I
didn't wanna die.

01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:43.219
I wanted to live!

01:21:45.088 --> 01:21:47.724
So my friends,
that's my message.

01:21:47.757 --> 01:21:50.727
We must remain
faithful and positive.

01:21:52.496 --> 01:21:54.964
And then we can do

01:21:56.232 --> 01:21:57.066
anything!

01:21:58.269 --> 01:21:58.902
Because

01:22:00.069 --> 01:22:01.905
when it comes right down to it,

01:22:03.072 --> 01:22:05.808
there are so many
ducks left to feed.

01:22:10.347 --> 01:22:11.181
Thank you.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:08.770
