00:02.035 --> 00:05.004
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.575
<i>Michael was preparing his sister...</i>

00:09.676 --> 00:12.304
<i>for her upcoming deposition
in the case against their father.</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:16.280
If they say, "Did you know of any
financial improprieties?” you’ll...

00:16.383 --> 00:18.351
Unbutton my shirt a bit
and give 'em this look.

00:20.053 --> 00:23.284
- Not really sure what you're goin' for.
- I drank a lot last night.

00:23.390 --> 00:28.692
- Why were you drinking? - If I look like
a man who made love to his wife last night...

00:28.795 --> 00:32.390
- it's because I almost did.
- That's why.

00:32.499 --> 00:35.525
<i>But Tobias had
a low tolerance for alcohol.</i>

00:35.635 --> 00:38.570
Oh, you look very hands...

00:38.671 --> 00:41.037
So you just finished off the bottle?

00:41.141 --> 00:43.041
I had to. It's vodka.
It goes bad once it's opened.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.543
I think that's another
one of Mom's little fibs.

00:45.645 --> 00:48.375
You know, like,
"I'll sacrifice anything for my children."

00:48.481 --> 00:52.008
Speaking of Mom, she really
doesn't want me to do this deposition.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.586
You have to, Lindsay.
Sorry. You've been subpoenaed.

00:54.687 --> 00:56.552
I'm afraid I might not be able
to be deposed either.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.750
I got a call out of the blue for a chance
to play a very important part...

00:59.859 --> 01:02.794
in... <i>The Prosecution.</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:06.127
- The prosecution called you?
- I assume it's a CBS procedural.

01:06.232 --> 01:10.259
They didn't send sides, so I thought I'd trot out
a <i>Vagina Monologue</i> or something else I know.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.429
They did ask for old photos
and documents...

01:12.539 --> 01:14.905
so I went and got these
out of the secret room... Oop.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.999
"The prosecution" is not a TV show.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.079
It's clearly somebody in the D.A.'s office
trying to get you to flip.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.741
These guys will bend the law
to enforce the law.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.977
Tell me that's not a CBS franchise.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.486
I'm serious. Why else would they
want all these documents?

01:28.588 --> 01:30.488
For set dressing, silly.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.252
Those Hollywood shows
are so incredibly detailed.

01:33.359 --> 01:36.089
You're gonna tell them you're not interested.
We all have to be careful.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.426
The prosecution's gonna be
coming after all of us.

01:38.531 --> 01:41.295
- Including me?
- You don't have any secrets.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.302
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I...

01:44.404 --> 01:46.429
Um, hey, uh, speaking of that.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.439
It's actually her birthday soon...

01:48.541 --> 01:50.441
so I thought we could all
do something for her.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.842
- Whose birthday?
- Maeby's.

01:53.947 --> 01:58.145
I was changing the subject. We... No.
Yeah, we weren't talking about Maeby.

01:58.251 --> 02:01.118
But she's been feeling kind of
left out of the family lately...

02:01.221 --> 02:03.781
and I thought maybe we could
throw her a surprise party.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.188
Actually, he'd already told her about it.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.055
I just poured Mom into bed.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.187
- Would it kill her to let some vodka go bad?
- No. Vodka doesn't...

02:11.297 --> 02:13.731
It's my birthday in a week,
and I bet you they don't even know.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.893
They forget every year.
I should just move out.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.733
But they're planning
a surprise party for you.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.171
They wouldn't forget your 16th birthday.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.971
Oh, my gosh.
Our little girl's turning 14.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.844
- Sixteen actually.
- Well, I am off to buy the perfect present.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.509
- Maybe she'd like a suit like this.
<i>- That</i> is <i>her suit.</i>

02:32.619 --> 02:36.578
- They probably don't make it in a woman's style.
<i>- They</i> only <i>make it in a woman's.</i>

02:36.689 --> 02:38.748
Well, I'm off, my love.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.326
- You see? Sometimes, shame can be fun.
- Shame?

02:41.427 --> 02:44.089
Secrets. You... You said "shame."

02:44.197 --> 02:46.665
He said "shame."

02:46.766 --> 02:48.734
How does he know about her?

02:48.835 --> 02:51.531
Didn't he just say Gob
should be ashamed of himself?

02:51.638 --> 02:54.232
No, but give it a while. Somebody will.
What's all that for?

02:54.340 --> 02:57.901
- It's for my out-of-town act.
- Out of town, Gob?

02:58.011 --> 03:01.538
- The prosecution is watching every move we make.
- I'm just going to Iraq.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.616
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

03:03.716 --> 03:06.776
No, you're not. Dad is up on treason charges
for building homes in Iraq.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.013
- It's a USO tour.
- You're not going.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.023
I'm doing my Christian magic act
my religion girlfriend helped me work out.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.593
I dress up like Jesus, walk on water,
which you've seen.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.889
- I'm gonna do the wine into water.
- It's water into wine.

03:16.996 --> 03:19.658
Then I've just emptied out
all your wine bottles...

03:19.766 --> 03:21.927
and filled them
with fake stuff for nothing.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.196
Great. How am I supposed
to have sex with my husband now?

03:24.304 --> 03:27.637
Gob. We got the depositions.
You're not goin' to Iraq.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.537
You're just jealous
that I am the son...

03:29.642 --> 03:33.237
that the father has asked
to do his work in the Holy Land.

03:33.346 --> 03:37.077
- So Dad <i>is</i> behind this.
- And he won't bump me up to business class.

03:37.183 --> 03:41.552
<i>Later that day,
Tobias met with the prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis.</i>

03:41.654 --> 03:46.455
...a flower in my garden,
a mystery in my panties.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.459
This is not an audition
for a CBS show.

03:48.561 --> 03:52.463
- I was just looking for some feedback.
- It was a little contrived.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.056
Now, we think we can
offer you a good deal...

03:55.168 --> 03:58.331
if you provide evidence
that puts George Bluth behind bars.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.896
I'll tell you what else is contrived...
the odds I would turn on my family...

04:02.008 --> 04:04.067
for somebody who is not
only trying to hurt them...

04:04.177 --> 04:07.146
but who wouldn't know good acting
if it marched through that door...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.579
and gave them head shots
and decorative soaps.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.242
<i>And as Tobias waited for the elevator...</i>

04:12.352 --> 04:15.788
<i>he noticed an interesting flyer
promising the perfect gift...</i>

04:15.888 --> 04:18.584
<i>for the daughter who didn't
feel part of the family.</i>

04:18.690 --> 04:21.922
- He took the bait.
- He's a classic scrapbooker.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.496
Right down to the woman's suit.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.930
<i>Michael went to confront
his father about Gob's trip to Iraq.</i>

04:28.034 --> 04:31.299
Everyone knows you built homes
for Saddam Hussein. Tell me what's going on.

04:31.404 --> 04:34.066
For the millionth time,
I was a patsy.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.266
I gotta find a loophole
to get out of this...

04:36.376 --> 04:40.813
but Buster took coma
and your mother took rehab.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.972
Hey. You goin' to rehab again?

04:43.082 --> 04:46.313
I'm bringing Lindsay.
I'm worried about her.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.250
Did you get the corkscrew?

04:48.354 --> 04:50.515
I see there's gonna be wine
at the rehab, huh?

04:50.623 --> 04:53.456
Wine only turns into alcohol
if you let it sit.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.027
How do you come up with these?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.290
I'll meet with the prosecutor,
ask for a postponement.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.299
But I'm gonna have to go on the record
about why you two aren't there.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.335
If you make a liar out of me,
we're gonna be in big trouble.

05:03.436 --> 05:07.497
- This constant bickering is gonna
put me in a coma. - Nice try, Dad.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.906
<i>Buster was finding his fake coma hard to sustain.</i>

05:11.010 --> 05:14.309
It takes a lot of courage
to endure what they put you through...

05:14.414 --> 05:17.247
especially since your mother
saw that Web site.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.648
<i>Buster was not only providing
medical students...</i>

05:19.752 --> 05:21.481
<i>a live body to learn</i> on...

05:21.587 --> 05:24.249
That's okay. Try again.
No. That's a tendon.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.918
He'd be screaming right now.
That's okay. Try again.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.929
<i>He'd also served as a human canvas
for aspiring beauticians.</i>

05:32.031 --> 05:35.592
That's okay. You put too much collagen
in there. No, no. Try it again.

05:35.702 --> 05:39.160
<i>And a much-needed set of teeth
for a dental program...</i>

05:39.272 --> 05:41.240
<i>Designed to encourage at-risk youth.</i>

05:41.341 --> 05:44.572
That's okay, Turf.
No. Try again.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.272
You've got your forearm
on this windpipe, Dog Bone.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.509
<i>- It really was amazing for their self-esteem.</i>
- I did it.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.381
<i>Even Buster was moved.</i>

05:54.487 --> 05:57.012
<i>But he endured it all for Adelaide.</i>

05:57.123 --> 05:59.023
I love you, Buster.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.026
What I would give to hear you say
you love me too...

06:02.128 --> 06:05.097
even if it meant you'd been
faking this whole time.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.395
Speak to me.
Say anything, my love.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.765
Anything?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.599
Faker!

06:12.705 --> 06:16.402
I wasn't faking my love for you.
I didn't want to testify at my dad's trial.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.943
- Well, you're a coward.
- No!

06:19.045 --> 06:21.275
Adelaide, how could you
let this happen again?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.817
I wish you'd come to,
or don't you care about me?

06:24.917 --> 06:28.409
- Of course I care about you.
- You faker!

06:28.521 --> 06:30.989
How could I let this
happen to me again?

06:31.090 --> 06:34.082
Take a single step
to show me your love, Gary.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.995
Aw! Faker!

06:37.096 --> 06:38.996
<i>She was wrong on that one.</i>

06:39.098 --> 06:41.066
<i>It was love
that made Gary take that step.</i>

06:41.167 --> 06:44.227
Who ever said vegetables
were good for your heart?

06:44.337 --> 06:46.999
No, no. No, please.

06:47.106 --> 06:50.735
<i>Of course, he hadn't used his legs in three weeks.</i>

06:50.843 --> 06:52.743
<i>And Michael met with Wayne Jarvis.</i>

06:52.845 --> 06:55.245
I apologize for the rest of my family
not being here.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.579
They wanted to testify,
but they all have perfectly legal excuses.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.619
And I can assure you
that no one is hiding.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.781
Michael, your mother and your sister
are not in a rehab center.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.756
- Where are they really?
- We don't know.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.259
But we do know the two people
who checked into Shady Pines...

07:09.362 --> 07:13.594
under the names Lucille Bluth
and Lindsay Fünke are not your relatives.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.428
Also, for someone in a coma...

07:15.535 --> 07:19.631
your brother Buster has made an impressive
15 phone calls to radio stations...

07:19.739 --> 07:22.799
alternately requesting "I Will Survive” and...
What was the other one?

07:22.909 --> 07:25.878
- "She's Out of My Life."
- "She's Out of My Life."

07:25.978 --> 07:28.412
As for your brother Gob
in the USO...

07:28.514 --> 07:30.846
- Don't tell me he's not in Iraq?
- No, he's there.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.885
In fact, Michael,
he's on the news... right now.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.880
Are bees better
at sniffing out drugs than dogs?

07:38.991 --> 07:41.425
I'm sure it's coming right up.
They've been playing it all day.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.155
<i>And they deliver
insulin right to my door.</i>

07:44.263 --> 07:46.026
I'm sure it's right after
this series of ads.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.828
It's, like, every time
you turn on the TV, it's there.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.597
- Why don't we just go online?
- Cool your Japanese jets.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.639
<i>- An insurgent in Iraq from
Orange County, California?</i> - It's on.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.074
<i>Why he's being held in jail and why
he won't be coming home anytime soon.</i>

07:59.178 --> 08:03.137
And imagine the impact if that had come on
right when we turned on the TV.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.955
<i>Michael had been called
to sign his brother out of the hospital.</i>

08:13.059 --> 08:15.960
You can stop pretending to be in a coma.
We heard your requests on the way over.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.327
I'm not faking it, Michael.
I really am this expressionless.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.332
My love thinks I'm a coward...

08:21.434 --> 08:25.302
just because I was using precious
hospital resources to avoid my legal obligation.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.066
That does say coward.
We've got bigger problems.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.506
- Gob is locked in a prison in Iraq.
- What?

08:30.610 --> 08:33.635
- So he's actually in an Iraqi prison?
- No. It's US run.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.976
- Oh.
- God knows what they're doing to him.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.107
Mom and Lindsay
are pretending to be in rehab.

08:38.217 --> 08:43.052
I can't get ahold of Dad, and I have
to fly to Iraq myself to get Gob.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.851
- Do you have to go by yourself?
- Let me go with you.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.724
I was trained by army.
I speak the language.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.922
You speak Arabic?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.329
- What's that mean?
- I was just clearing my throat.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.594
But I think it actually
does mean "laundry."

08:56.702 --> 08:59.262
Like a child's laundry.
We don't really have a word for it.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.569
But this is exactly what I need
to prove to my love...

09:02.675 --> 09:05.041
that I am a hero,
not a coward.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.442
I have my uniform here.
Mother brought it for the photo shoot.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.680
Would you be back in time
for Maeby's surprise party?

09:11.784 --> 09:14.184
Probably not.
We'll do something when I get back.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.279
Why don't you drive the stair car home.
Buster and I will leave from here.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.848
- Be careful.
- Hey. Who's tougher than us?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.697
Close one.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.496
<i>The depositions had been delayed...</i>

09:30.603 --> 09:34.596
<i>but the prosecution was about to get
a Lord & Taylor bag full of evidence.</i>

09:34.707 --> 09:37.301
We supply the glitter,
the glue, the crepe paper...

09:37.410 --> 09:41.744
and the ready-made template pages
for you to decorate and fill out with...

09:41.847 --> 09:46.216
My Favorite Birthday,
Foreign Bank Statements...

09:46.319 --> 09:49.379
and, of course...shh...
Family Secrets.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.218
<i>The scrapbooking sting
had helped the DA gather evidence...</i>

09:52.325 --> 09:55.522
<i>against people as diverse
as Ken Lay...</i>

09:57.363 --> 09:59.297
<i>Oliver North...</i>

10:00.366 --> 10:03.392
<i>but, ironically, not Martha Stewart.</i>

10:03.502 --> 10:06.335
So dig up whatever you can,
and remember...

10:06.439 --> 10:09.306
photocopies are not
admissible as memories.

10:09.408 --> 10:12.969
Sir, I'm gonna have to go to
our old family storage unit in Reseda.

10:13.079 --> 10:16.105
No problem. We can arrange for a helicopter
to take you there right now.

10:16.215 --> 10:20.345
Wow! This is the best free
scrapbooking class I've ever taken.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.320
<i>Meanwhile,
Lindsay and Lucille were at a spa in the desert...</i>

10:23.422 --> 10:26.482
<i>avoiding both rehab
and their depositions.</i>

10:26.592 --> 10:29.993
Four saunas, three steam baths,
Olympic-sized pool...

10:30.096 --> 10:32.690
and you're telling me
there's no alcohol?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.699
What the hell are we
supposed to do for two days?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.133
I could take the top off this grape juice,
and maybe by morning...

10:38.237 --> 10:42.970
- Oh, for God's sake, Lindsay! Grow up!
You're 40 years old. - Thirty-five.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.339
Well, maybe this will be nice. Hmm?

10:45.444 --> 10:48.777
We can talk and...
connect a little.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.147
- I must have a Xanax.
- I'll go score some weed from the staff.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.814
<i>And Michael and Buster
checked out of the hospital.</i>

10:57.923 --> 10:59.914
I can't believe they wouldn't
give me a wheelchair ride.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.223
You're gonna be sitting on a plane
for 18 hours to Iraq.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.297
Yeah, I should definitely
get one for the airport.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.298
You're going to Iraq?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.561
Yes. I'm going to save my brother.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.899
So you are brave after all.

11:12.004 --> 11:17.465
Fighting for your brother. Oh, Buster,
you're such a !@%$#.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.976
- That means she likes you.
- It's more than "like."

11:20.079 --> 11:22.377
I'd give anything
to have you stay here.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.711
Then I will stay here.
I was scared to go anyway.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.512
- Faker!
- Oh!

11:26.619 --> 11:30.248
- I knew you were no good.
- Than I shall go... to forget you.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.814
- Oh, Buster, don't go.
- I don't wanna go.

11:33.926 --> 11:37.487
I'm gonna save everybody a lot of trouble
and say that we are going. Come on.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.589
When I miss your lips, I'll put a fig
in my mouth and think of you.

11:43.736 --> 11:47.069
- They have figs over there, right?
- I'll wait for you.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.869
- What's this?
- Cab driver said he went into a coma...

11:49.975 --> 11:52.341
as soon as they
pulled up to the hospital.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.709
What a brave man.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.577
<i>And soon the Bluth boys...</i>

11:56.682 --> 11:59.344
<i>found themselves in a strange land.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:08.019
What did he say?
Where are we?

12:08.127 --> 12:09.958
He said he was taking
surface streets to LAX.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.030
The freeway's backed up all the way
to Knott's Berry Farm.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.362
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
got ahold of Maeby's address book...</i>

12:15.468 --> 12:19.029
<i>to invite all her friends
to her sweet 16.</i>

12:19.138 --> 12:22.539
<i>He did, however, decide against
some guests he found threatening.</i>

12:22.641 --> 12:24.836
I don't think Steve Holt
has to come to this.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.708
<i>And yet he did invite Mickey Rourke.</i>

12:27.813 --> 12:30.805
<i>And the guys finally did get to Iraq...</i>

12:30.916 --> 12:32.884
<i>but Buster's Arabic
was a little rusty.</i>

12:32.985 --> 12:37.752
<i>And instead of a cab, he hired them
the only rickshaw in Baghdad.</i>

12:37.857 --> 12:39.950
Are you ready
for Operation Hot Brother?

12:40.059 --> 12:41.959
I'm not ready to call it that.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.622
<i>They arrived at the prison the Americans
were training Iraqis to run.</i>

12:45.731 --> 12:47.722
No. What'd you forget?

12:47.833 --> 12:50.893
Walk them through the...
The what?

12:51.003 --> 12:53.767
- The metal detector.
- That's okay. Try again.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.397
<i>My God! You came!</i>

12:55.508 --> 12:57.999
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, I missed you, Michael!

12:58.110 --> 13:01.568
- All right.
- Or should I say "robot"?

13:01.680 --> 13:05.241
- What, 'cause I'm not crying? - Maybe you
don't have enough RAM to understand this...

13:05.351 --> 13:08.286
but there's such a thing
as brotherly love.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.116
What's he doing here?
I thought he was in a coma.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.247
I was trying to prove
to this nurse that I'm brave.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.918
I need to get a picture of me with the insurgent.
I can send it on my phone.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.257
Why were you arrested
by the Americans?

13:17.363 --> 13:20.526
I was doing a little off-mission street magic,
trying to make a few dinars.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.501
<i>And that is why Jesus
was often referred to as...</i>

13:24.603 --> 13:28.437
"the king... of kings."

13:28.541 --> 13:31.442
Queens. The king of queens.

13:31.544 --> 13:35.344
Now I would like you to behold
one of the late, great Jesus's biggest illusions...

13:35.447 --> 13:36.880
The burning bush!

13:36.982 --> 13:39.041
Bush? Burn Bush?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.812
- Burn Bush!
- Burning Bush!

13:40.920 --> 13:42.615
Burn Bush!

13:42.721 --> 13:44.552
<i>The security forces arrived to suppress...</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:48.286
<i>what appeared to be
an anti-American demonstration.</i>

13:51.096 --> 13:55.499
That's okay. Use your foot. The thigh bruises.
What doesn't? Try again.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.297
So you weren't doing
anything for Dad?

13:58.404 --> 14:01.134
He had said, if I happened to be
in the neighborhood of Sadr City and Mamoon...

14:01.240 --> 14:03.140
would I mind torching
a couple model homes?

14:03.242 --> 14:06.803
Dad's just trying to keep information
out of the hands of the Iraqis.

14:06.912 --> 14:10.006
I have a feeling he was trying to keep information
out of the hands of the federal marshals.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.242
I'm gonna go collect my things
and say my good-byes.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.013
- You guys check me outta here.
- You're an enemy combatant.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.180
It's not gonna be that easy.
I'll talk to them...

14:18.290 --> 14:20.485
but you might wanna prepare
for a long stay.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.560
Oh, shoot. I forgot
to say good-bye to Yusef.

14:29.668 --> 14:33.104
That was a lot easier than I expected.
Almost too easy.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.173
Why aren't we going to the airport?

14:35.274 --> 14:38.107
I wanna check out this house Dad
asked you to burn down, see what he's hiding.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.112
I think that's it, sir.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.615
- Buster, this guy speaks English.
- No. I swallowed a moth.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.618
I'm sorry it took so long...

14:47.720 --> 14:52.350
but the Cheney Expressway was backed up
all the way to Halliburton Drive.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.756
Let's see what all the mystery's about.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.350
<i>That's when Michael found someone...</i>

14:56.462 --> 14:59.693
<i>the U.S. Government</i>
had <i>been able to depose.</i>

14:59.798 --> 15:03.063
- Hello?
- Take my picture!

15:03.168 --> 15:05.898
Take my picture!

15:09.909 --> 15:13.868
<i>Michael was in Iraq
when he came across a familiar face.</i>

15:13.979 --> 15:17.142
- Are you, uh...
- I am Saddam Hussein...

15:17.249 --> 15:19.308
look-alike.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.579
- Who are you?
- I'm Michael Bluth.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.121
These are my brothers
Buster and Gob Bluth.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.624
Bluth? Is he here to fix
the air conditioning?

15:27.726 --> 15:32.322
- Are you both Saddam Hussein look-alikes?
- Hardly. Invite them in.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.491
I am behaving
like an Uday look-alike.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.001
Come on in.
Come on in, guys.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.594
I'd always heard that there
were Saddam Hussein look-alikes.

15:40.706 --> 15:44.665
I'm just a little surprised to see you all
living here in... in one house...

15:44.777 --> 15:46.745
that looks so similar to ours.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.678
- Scar on that one dude's forehead's
gotta be a problem. - That's Achmed.

15:49.782 --> 15:54.719
Never stop watching the trial.
We are all following it pretty closely.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.152
They put this guy away,
you guys are out of a job, huh?

15:57.256 --> 16:00.123
Yes. We wanted to keep the house
for just one more season.

16:00.225 --> 16:04.662
- I have a baby on the way.
- I do a better Saddam than this guy.

16:04.763 --> 16:07.664
- My Saddam would show his teeth.
- Yes, to chew the scenery.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.599
<i>So Michael decided the least he could do...</i>

16:10.703 --> 16:12.603
<i>was take a look
at the air conditioning.</i>

16:12.705 --> 16:14.605
<i>But before he did,
he decided to see...</i>

16:14.707 --> 16:18.666
<i>if there was a secret room
in this model home as well.</i>

16:18.777 --> 16:22.941
<i>And that's when Michael
discovered the bombshell.</i>

16:23.048 --> 16:24.845
Buster.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.975
<i>Back at the American model home...</i>

16:27.086 --> 16:29.850
<i>none of the invitees
had shown up for Maeby's party.</i>

16:29.955 --> 16:33.220
- Surprise.
- That's what I figured.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.385
So, did you send one of these
to everyone in my address book?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.463
Yeah. I'm really sorry
they didn't come.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.692
- I don't know what happened.
- I do. They found out I was 16.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.735
<i>And a lot of us just didn't
want to drive down to Orange County.</i>

16:44.837 --> 16:47.772
- What are you talking about?
- This cost me my job, George Michael.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.104
I was a studio executive.
I made movies.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.111
- Is that why you've been so stressed out
all the time? - Have I been?

16:54.213 --> 16:57.114
You know what? I'm a kid.
I'm gonna start acting like one.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.117
- What, you're gonna drink?
- Do you wanna join me?

17:00.219 --> 17:02.278
I guess if you can run a studio...

17:02.388 --> 17:05.755
<i>But they didn't know
it was the fake wine from Gob's magic show.</i>

17:05.858 --> 17:07.758
- It's good.
<i>- And back in Iraq.</i>

17:07.859 --> 17:12.058
- What is this?
- Looks like a mid-range nuclear warhead.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.429
It has a range capacity
of 4,000 to 5,000 nautical miles.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.934
You've got a pretty sophisticated
knowledge of this technology.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.528
My God. It makes me wanna
have an ice cream cone.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.574
- Doesn't this make you wanna
have an ice cream cone? - It does.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.405
You'll have plenty of time
for ice cream in prison.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.502
Ice cream sandwiches.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.014
- CIA, undercover.
- CIA. Of course.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.846
This explains why it was so easy
to get you out of prison.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.920
I knew that, if he got out,
he would lead us...

17:36.021 --> 17:37.989
right to whatever
your dad was hidin'.

17:38.090 --> 17:41.082
<i>They'd even
created opportunities for this to happen.</i>

17:41.193 --> 17:43.661
- Get in the cell, stupid.
- You're... You're...

17:43.762 --> 17:47.926
You're the one who didn't
even shut the door. Come on!

17:48.033 --> 17:50.593
Yeah. You guys can run
this place without us.

17:50.702 --> 17:55.503
As... As soon as you stop
dropping your keys! Come on!

17:55.607 --> 17:58.701
<i>They'd even staged something
called an "honor marathon"...</i>

17:58.811 --> 18:02.440
<i>- they thought he was sure to take advantage of.</i>
- Come on.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.982
<i>We've been lookin' for WMD's for years.</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:10.522
WMD's? This thing is as fake
as Achmed's mustache. See?

18:10.622 --> 18:12.817
Yeah, look. It's a HomeFill.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.019
It's the company that makes the fake stuff
we fill the model homes with.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.824
- What the hell?
- What is that, a recording device?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.627
This is our stuff.
I gotta call this in.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.667
Buster? Please?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.464
Baker.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.665
It doesn't sound like CIA East.
I'll check with CIA West.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.072
Did we bug a house in Mamoon?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.245
Yeah. We got some guy
named George Bluth...

18:34.346 --> 18:36.541
to build houses there
so we could wire them.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.711
Oh, look. I'm Uncle Buster.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.810
I'm sorry no one
from the family came.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.219
Sometimes I wish I wasn't
even part of the family.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.518
- No, don't...
- Yes.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.992
I've never wanted
to say this, but...

18:50.095 --> 18:52.086
you might not even
be related to us.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.324
- No?
- 'Cause Gangy once said to me...

18:54.433 --> 18:57.231
your mom might not have
ever even been pregnant with you.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.804
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.032
No. I'm, uh... I wouldn't.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.575
Everyone still loves you.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.770
Some more than others.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.610
<i>And perhaps it was the fake wine...</i>

19:10.716 --> 19:13.844
<i>but that was the night George Michael
and Maeby went to second base.</i>

19:16.021 --> 19:19.013
So my dad <i>was</i> a patsy?

19:19.124 --> 19:22.252
We call them "unintentional
operations victims," but yes.

19:22.361 --> 19:25.194
We ran the whole operation
through a British building company.

19:25.297 --> 19:26.855
They contacted my dad
for the plans.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.195
I can't believe it.
After all of that, he wasn't lying.

19:29.301 --> 19:33.237
Look, we feel terrible.
Because this is really our mistake.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.239
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take you guys out.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.468
- Take us out?
- What?

19:38.577 --> 19:40.067
I could really go
for some Italian.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.874
There is an Olive Garden
in Mamoon.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.744
I think he means
to shoot you in the head.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.648
But please, at least let him
look at the air conditioning.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.517
If you're worried about us talking,
we will not say a word.

19:50.622 --> 19:53.955
Don't be mad, but I have been sending
the pictures from my cell phone to my friend.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.050
- Not now, Buster.
- He does not know what he's saying.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.789
- You have?
- Uh...

19:58.897 --> 20:02.458
Well, who knows
who <i>she</i> sent them to?

20:04.770 --> 20:08.399
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
- Hmm?

20:08.507 --> 20:12.910
- Looks like you are a hero, Buster.
- We both are.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.502
- Well...
- Okay. Looks like you got us.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.775
What can the US government
do for you?

20:17.883 --> 20:22.183
We're gonna need some business class
tickets home... and direct flights.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.085
None of this
stopping in Phoenix !@%$-!@%$.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.181
And more importantly,
maybe we can drop...

20:27.292 --> 20:29.260
some of these treason charges
against my father.

20:29.361 --> 20:33.320
And I do believe there was
some mention of some ice cream.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.993
<i>And so, with Operation Hot Brother a success...</i>

20:37.102 --> 20:39.696
<i>our American heroes left Iraq.</i>

20:39.805 --> 20:42.933
Take Condoleezza Rice Lane. It's quicker.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.771
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

20:45.877 --> 20:48.505
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

20:48.614 --> 20:52.710
<i>Tobias gives his daughter the gift
he'd stayed up all night making.</i>

20:52.818 --> 20:55.309
And here's a picture
of your mother pregnant.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.287
And here's a whole series
of your head starting to crown.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.791
Look at you...
so full of wonder and shock.

21:01.893 --> 21:04.418
You still do it.
And so does he!

21:04.529 --> 21:07.726
Boy, you guys really are related.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.393
<i>And Michael and Gob
make an interesting discovery.</i>

21:10.502 --> 21:13.027
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

21:13.138 --> 21:15.606
The real Saddam
has a scar on his head.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.801
- I'm no scar. I'm no scar.
- Oh, my God.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.537
Dot com.
