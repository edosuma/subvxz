you'd let me know, right, buddy?</i>

00:16.079 --> 00:18.640
Why did they call in the
FBI to Little Salvador?

00:18.720 --> 00:21.154
A car's got Virginia
plates across state line.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.313
There's a suspected gang member and RICO
to deaI with. Do you really want to know?

00:25.400 --> 00:29.552
No. I was using it as an excuse to make
conversation and re-establish our connection.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.599
- What?
- I read about improving work relationships.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.879
- I don't expect you to tell me everything.
- I appreciate the effort, Bones.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.073
It's like they recreated their country,
down to being terrified of the police.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.153
A lot of them are undocumented and get
nervous around the law. What have we got?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.708
Ran a stop sign. I pulled
him over, he tried to run.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.078
Oh, look at this
- a Mara Muerte tattoo. It's one of the most feared gangs in the area.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.594
No wonder he was chauffeuring
a dead body around.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.478
- Couldn'tjoin the Boys Club?
- I'm here because...?

01:00.560 --> 01:04.837
On routine inspection of
the vehicle, I found this.

01:07.560 --> 01:11.917
VerticaI brow ridge suggests
female. Recently dug up, looks like.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.560
Could you hold his hands up, please?

01:14.640 --> 01:19.430
We should analyse the dirt on his hands
and compare it to the dirt on the remains.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.476
Where was she buried?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.792
- He's ignoring us in two languages.
- Where's the cemetery?

01:29.880 --> 01:35.750
The closest one I know about is Holy Rood,
but that's a good ten miles from here.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.598
- Maybe your Spanish is a little rusty.
- They think getting involved gets you killed.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.748
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

02:02.920 --> 02:05.434
Shots fired! Shots fired!

02:06.880 --> 02:08.916
Hey!

02:11.960 --> 02:13.996
Hey!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.355
Don't make me shoot you!

03:15.400 --> 03:21.589
Decomp, insect activity, volatile fatty-acid
levels in the soiI due to putrefaction

03:21.680 --> 03:23.989
suggest she was buried for six months.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.675
Typically, gravediggers are
necrophiliacs looking for action.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.159
Um... Eww.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.915
- DentaI exam shows striated enameI.
- Indicating?

03:33.000 --> 03:37.915
Malnutrition
- which, with anthropometrics, suggests the victim is from CentraI America.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.116
We found her in a
Salvadorian neighbourhood.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.510
In Pikeville, Tennessee, a guy dug
up the graves of all these people

03:43.600 --> 03:46.239
to make sure their
bodies were still there.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.355
They weren't.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.991
Sketch the face. I'm not sure if we'll find
a match. She might have been undocumented.

03:52.080 --> 03:56.995
Goodman is an expert in iconography. Maybe
he'll determine where this rosary was made.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.471
Depression fracture on her occipitaI bone
straddling the left lambdoidaI suture.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.994
One hard hit congruent
with, say, a baseball bat.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.878
She was religious. She
should have had a casket,

04:06.960 --> 04:10.077
a proper buriaI with
her name on a headstone.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.789
We are going to find out who she is
and we are going to give her that.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.711
<i>MigueI Villeda.</i>

04:16.800 --> 04:20.349
Warlord of the Venganza
Roja street gang.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.797
According to this, you
are one fierce, fierce guy.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.792
- It didn't stop your guys from picking me up.
- They say why?

04:27.880 --> 04:30.553
Someone took a shot at some Mara Muerte.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.790
Not a shot.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.678
A couple of dozen shots. A drive-by.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.072
Hardly anyone is stupid enough to shoot
at those guys any more. Your name came up.

04:40.160 --> 04:44.915
It wasn't my people. So, are you gonna
charge me with something or let me go?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.437
Extortion, drugs,
assault, attempted murder.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.750
I could hold you for a while.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.435
- What's your problem, man?
- My problem is that somebody shot at me.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.239
Shot at me and my partner.
Plus a bad guy got away.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.073
So I'm a little cranky
about the whole thing.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.435
<i>Mira, gabacho.</i>

05:03.520 --> 05:07.274
I don't really scare that way - the
whole in-your-face staring thing.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.989
No? Give me a chance, man.
I'm just getting started.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.799
- So someone shot at you, huh?
- That's right.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.917
When was the last time you heard
of a drive-by where no one got hit?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.199
Innocent bystanders mostly. It's not
like you always hit what you aim at.

05:22.280 --> 05:27.638
Think, just for a couple of seconds,
about why the guy never got hit.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.234
Ah, yeah, you see? You got it now?

05:33.320 --> 05:35.515
Mara Muerte did a
drive-by on their own guy?

05:35.600 --> 05:39.832
A drive-by happens, yeah.
And you all hit the deck.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.310
And the gangbanger makes a run for it.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.838
I have it on good authority
the guys who shot at our killer

05:57.920 --> 06:00.275
were doing it so he'd
have a chance to escape.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.432
The victim was pregnant when
she was hit over the head.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.239
- Pregnant?
- Five weeks along. Get your hands off.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.756
I ran samples from the body, shoveI
and burlap through the chromatograph

06:09.840 --> 06:13.992
and it came back full of organic compounds
- plant detritus, root remnants, fertiliser.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.072
- Stuff you'd find in a cemetery.
- I also found this.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.913
<i>Fernaldia pandurata,
otherwise known as loroco buds.</i>

06:20.000 --> 06:23.515
Loroco is an edible flowering
plant. It's native to El Salvador.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.114
It's grown in vegetable
gardens, not cemeteries.

06:26.200 --> 06:30.239
She was buried in a vegetable garden?
OK. Can you recognise this loco plant?

06:30.320 --> 06:33.198
Loroco. I've eaten it, but
I wouldn't recognise it.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.512
It's quite distinctive. I'm also
analysing the dirt on the suspect's shoe.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.593
First glance, it matches the vegetation
we found, but with a couple of extras.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.992
OK. Hodgins, suit up. You're coming
with us. We're going to the barrio.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.390
Fieldwork! CooI! Do I get a gun?

06:49.480 --> 06:53.473
- You can't arm Hodgins and not me.
- What is it with you people and the guns?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.429
Look at this. The government goes
bankrupt giving tax breaks to the rich,

07:02.520 --> 07:06.399
so there's no money left to help these
people with job training, health care...

07:06.480 --> 07:08.516
Just look for a garden with the plant.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.275
Those who do land ajob work for a
minimum wage that hasn't risen in years.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.511
That's for those here legally.
The undocumented do a lot worse.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.309
What is this? NPR Radio? Are
you two running for office?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.834
<i>Look. Over there.</i>

07:24.000 --> 07:25.991
Loroco plant.

07:27.960 --> 07:34.354
That's the same approximate maturity
that would have yielded the buds we found.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.272
Adipocere. Forms on the body in
response to moisture on the ground.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.989
Trogid beetles. They got a
thing for decomposing flesh.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.629
- Found a couple on the burlap.
- The rest of the rosary.

07:47.720 --> 07:52.316
There's another freshly
overturned pile of dirt over here.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.151
- More adipocere.
- Not from the same body?

08:03.240 --> 08:06.835
Another body was buried
here, but it's gone now.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.352
Double homicide.

08:21.480 --> 08:25.951
I spoke to the City Development Office.
The garden is being excavated next week.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.828
My guess is we interrupted a
gangbanger moving two murder victims.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.673
A gangbanger who buries
his victim with a rosary?

08:32.760 --> 08:37.629
- Did you find any gunshot wounds?
- No. Just head trauma.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.789
You really like this part, don't you?

08:39.880 --> 08:42.110
I like answers, yes.

08:44.600 --> 08:49.594
Localised staining on the
endocraniaI surface indicating...

08:49.680 --> 08:53.036
SubduraI haematoma. The head
wound caused internaI bleeding,

08:53.120 --> 08:55.634
but death was not instantaneous.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.553
<i>She may have been conscious
long after the assault.</i>

08:58.640 --> 09:04.158
But there's no sign of bone remodelling.
She died soon after the assault.

09:05.240 --> 09:10.394
There's patterning on the ectocraniaI surface.
Whatever weapon was used, it left a mark.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.755
We're gonna bring in the
leader of Mara Muerte.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.832
See if we can identify the
gangbanger that got away.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.516
- Why would a gang leader cooperate?
- I'm gonna ask him very, very nicely, Bones.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.034
You know that book I'm reading?

09:23.120 --> 09:26.635
It says sarcasm is never helpfuI.
I could lend it to you if you want.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.510
<i>I found Spodoptera ornithogalli and
tetranychus urticae on the shoe and victim.</i>

09:31.600 --> 09:33.830
<i>I also found Notonectidae and Corixidae.</i>

09:33.920 --> 09:37.196
It's an aquatic fauna typically
found around ponds and streams.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.589
There are no ponds or
streams at the buriaI site.

09:39.680 --> 09:45.550
<i>Here's the kicker. There was also evidence of
genetic materiaI from a franklinia alatamaha.</i>

09:45.640 --> 09:49.838
- You're kidding! Frankie Alabama?
- Did you hear what I said about sarcasm?

09:49.920 --> 09:53.879
It's a rare flowering plant that
hasn't been seen in the wild since 1800.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.270
The only known specimen in this
area outside a specialised garden

09:57.360 --> 10:00.397
was given to Senator
Alan Corman as a gift.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.278
- I love going after senators.
- Whoa. Simmer down.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.351
We'll check the botanicaI garden first.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.829
Fine. It's at the White House.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.114
You should do that even
less than normaI people.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.317
Keep your eyes open for
backswimmers and water boatmen.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.550
<i>The Notonectidae can
be different colours.</i>

10:17.640 --> 10:21.076
- That's a nice try. You're coming with us.
- I call shotgun.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.398
I called shotgun.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.552
What does it mean to a society
when niceties aren't observed?

10:27.640 --> 10:30.950
We got two bodies, one unaccounted
for. We've been shot at.

10:31.040 --> 10:36.194
And now we know that there's a gang
member walking around a US senator's place.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.191
Any theories?

10:38.280 --> 10:41.955
Come on, guys. Let's think of it as
a puzzle and there's a missing piece.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.830
<i>I like puzzles. I find them relaxing. I
just finished The Anatomy Lesson, Rembrandt.</i>

10:46.920 --> 10:50.230
- You're kidding, right?
- What do you find relaxing?

10:50.320 --> 10:54.632
- I... I restore vintage cars.
- I know what I find relaxing.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.109
Everybody finds what you
find relaxing relaxing.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.590
Corman is a big supporter of
business leaders in CentraI America.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.638
That means supporting
regimes that use death squads

11:03.720 --> 11:08.555
to silence any opposition from working
people, the same people who flee to the US.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.710
That's great. OK, let's focus.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.394
Now we have a link between
Corman and the Salvadorians.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.917
- You think the senator murdered two people?
- I think we got another piece of the puzzle.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.354
<i>No sé qué vas a hacer, pero
tengo que podar el árbol.</i>

11:28.440 --> 11:32.149
Because of my husband's
officiaI work in El Salvador,

11:32.240 --> 11:34.800
we formed a bond with the
country and the people.

11:34.880 --> 11:39.954
We have severaI Salvadorians working here.
I've sponsored quite a few for citizenship.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.759
Screening would keep out
members of death squads.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.193
Hodgins.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.795
Just because I'm anti-socialist
doesn't make me pro death squad.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.190
Dr Brennan has evidence that a gang
member has been on your property.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.840
We employ 20 staff
members, give or take.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.196
All of our staff members are
either legaI aliens or citizens.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.272
Our house manager's in charge
of hiring and managing them.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.352
Do you recognise this man?

12:03.440 --> 12:07.274
No. I assume he did something
worse than trespass on my property?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.715
- House manager, is he from El Salvador?
- Yes.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.509
- Agent, you didn't answer my question.
- We're investigating a death.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.310
- You understand why I can't talk about it.
- Could we show this to your house manager?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.516
Of course.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.160
<i>Franklinia alatamaha. It's beautifuI.</i>

12:23.240 --> 12:25.834
We're the only people
cultivating it privately.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.956
Do you have a pond on the property?

12:28.040 --> 12:30.474
Yes. On the other side
of the shrubs. It's small.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.031
- Could Dr Hodgins take a look at it?
- Of course. Be my guest.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.556
Logan, come say hello. We have guests.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.555
Our son. He's studying landscape architecture
at Georgetown. Likes to supervise the men.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.714
Logan, this is SpeciaI Agent Booth
from the FBI. His associate, Dr Brennan.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.952
- What's the FBI doing here?
- They'd like to ask Hector some questions.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.315
Yeah. Hey, Hector.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.039
<i>Ven. Hablamos para tú.</i>

13:02.160 --> 13:06.551
- Yes, sir?
- I'm Agent Booth. You recognise this guy?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.351
No, I don't think so.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.513
It could be José. He works
here sometimes as a gardener.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.955
Really? I don't think so.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.554
- José who?
- José Vargas.

13:18.640 --> 13:23.634
- Logan, Agent Booth said he was in a gang.
- A gang? No. No way.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.190
José's a nice guy.
You know, wife and kid.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.636
I found both backswimmers
and water boatmen.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.349
What is it?

13:45.680 --> 13:47.671
Gladly.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.037
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:00.600 --> 14:04.149
Looks like we found the second body.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.116
Casings of tineid moths puts the time of
death about a year, six months before the girI.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.830
Heart-shaped pelvic inlet, long projections of
bone into the ribs suggest it's a male over 60.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.798
Anthropometrics suggests
Hispanic origins.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.269
We reassembled the
rosary found on the woman.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.477
The carving of fire in the
centrepiece is an archetypaI symboI

14:29.560 --> 14:34.031
found at an area of El Salvador since the
Chaparrastique volcano erupted in 1787.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.315
This indicates where the female is from?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.949
A village called Milagro de la Paz
in the southeast of the country.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.952
I was there three years ago
identifying death-squad victims.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.032
I finished the sketch of the woman.

14:46.120 --> 14:51.592
She was pregnant, starting over in
a new country, so I gave her a smile.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.353
- Made her look hopefuI.
- Thanks, Angela.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.273
Let's clean the bones so we
can find a cause of death.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.351
I think I just found it.

15:04.880 --> 15:09.192
It's a bullet. Looks like
steeI core, copperjacket.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.432
Military issue. Those are
kinds of weapons gangs like.

15:13.520 --> 15:20.392
They escape from death squads and get killed
by the same weapon they were running from.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.870
<i>I got José's address from
Logan. Let's check it out.</i>

15:30.800 --> 15:31.835
Thanks.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.514
FBI. Make your presence known.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.640
Look. He has a family, a baby.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.951
Is anybody here? You
don't have to be afraid.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.436
<i>¿Hay alguien aquí? No
tiene que tener miedo.</i>

15:48.520 --> 15:52.308
Of course they're gonna be
afraid, Bones. I have a gun.

15:53.240 --> 15:57.074
Milagro de la Paz. That's
where the victims are from.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.310
They were here. The bottle's still warm.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.834
- They're still here.
- How do you know?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.310
They're prepared for this kind of thing.

16:07.720 --> 16:12.748
Hiding from death squads, people
learn to build false walls.

16:12.840 --> 16:19.439
Closet. OK, hold on, Bones. Let's just
pretend that I'm the cop for a second, OK?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.997
<i>Y o no sé nada. Por
favor, yo no hice nada.</i>

16:36.080 --> 16:39.868
<i>Solamente queremos
saber dónde está José.</i>

16:39.960 --> 16:42.315
<i>Él estará bien si no ha hecho nada malo.</i>

16:42.400 --> 16:43.913
What did you say?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.470
That we want to talk to José, that
they have nothing to worry about.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.869
Wanna be deported? Wanna
see your baby again?

16:49.960 --> 16:53.157
Because if he was born
here, we can keep him.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.390
Booth, stop! She's frightened enough.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.710
- We have a double murder.
- She didn't do it.

16:57.800 --> 17:02.112
Just tell her what I said. Tell her we're
calling Immigration and we'll get to José.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.556
No. She's lived with intimidation
her whole life. I won't add to it.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.790
You're acting like I'm gonna
hurt her. I just want information.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.031
I am asking you as a favour
not to make me do this.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.634
To scare her.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.073
Please.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.713
This is interesting.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.916
Interesting or horrible? Sometimes
it's the same thing with you.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.992
This hole in the sternum,
it's not a gunshot wound.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.275
It's a sternaI foramen.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.071
I found the same thing on the female
victim. It seemed like a meaningless anomaly.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.153
It's a hereditary condition.
The two victims were related.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.390
Based on their ages,
father and daughter.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.677
So father and daughter buried
next to each other, right?

17:45.760 --> 17:50.231
Then dug up. But then the
father was re-buried. Why?

17:50.320 --> 17:54.313
The gangbanger was taking the daughter
to be re-buried when the cops got him.

17:54.400 --> 17:59.155
This is the stuff that Booth is good at,
the murky ways of the human heart, all that.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.198
- We work the hard evidence.
- We've used up all the evidence.

18:02.280 --> 18:06.671
OK. OK, let's just... You know what?
Let's just pretend we're Booth, OK?

18:06.760 --> 18:08.751
Ooh! Let me try!

18:10.920 --> 18:13.718
The daughter got pregnant
from the killer and came here.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.828
- He catches up to him. They fight.
- He joins a gang and then kills her.

18:18.920 --> 18:23.152
The father comes after him seeking
revenge and the killer kills him.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.711
No, no. The father's death preceded
the daughter's by at least six months.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.952
I've found something. I can't get
this bullet out of the pelvic bone.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.234
Oh, wow.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.632
The bone started healing around
the bullet. See the remodelling?

18:37.720 --> 18:40.359
This wound healed years ago.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.591
- He didn't die by being shot.
- Tough old bastard.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.437
- How was he murdered?
- He wasn't murdered.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.877
- Metastatic carcinoma.
- Probably originating in the prostate.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.635
So he survives being shot,
then he dies of cancer?

18:55.720 --> 18:58.553
- Mega tough old bastard.
- Yeah.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.079
- Anything?
- Yeah.

19:08.160 --> 19:13.996
Immigration has the wife. She got a lawyer
from the Salvadorian League of... something.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.833
She's not giving us anything about José.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.514
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.395
But I could have gotten something
if you hadn't got all mushy on me.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.994
I was uncomfortable with...

19:27.080 --> 19:29.355
You always say I'm not a cop.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.239
You're right. Especially
in a situation like that.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.710
- It's OK. We're not gonna need her anyway.
- Really? Why?

19:37.800 --> 19:41.475
Cos I had the Gang Unit put a lean on
Roberto Ortez, the head of Mara Muerte.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.915
- The gang that José belongs to?
- Yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.912
They convinced Ortez to
bring José in for questioning.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.437
- But why would he do that?
- Ortez's sister is in the can for possession.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.910
- I promised him I could make that go away.
- Can you?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.070
It's a locaI beef, I'm a federaI...

19:57.160 --> 20:01.551
But hey, you know, I'm a cop, and
thank God for bad sisters, huh?

20:24.040 --> 20:28.318
He has a collapsed lung, broken ribs,
one arm is broken, shoulder's dislocated.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.436
- But we can talk to him?
- You can try.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.590
Hey, thanks.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.868
Your own guys? They'd do this to
you? Jeez, I wish I had my own gang.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.997
I don't belong to no
gang. I'm a gardener.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.072
Oh, a gardener with a Mara
Muerte tattoo on his neck

20:47.160 --> 20:50.197
who can now understand
English and plants dead bodies.

20:50.280 --> 20:54.558
- Maybe that stuff's private.
- You're an illegaI immigrant, a gang member.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.589
You're under arrest for transporting a dead
body and you're under suspicion for murder.

20:59.680 --> 21:04.993
I'm gonna call ICE and have you and
your wife deported back to El Salvador.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.789
- I got a son.
- Forget it. We keep the son.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.474
That's my son. It's my only son.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.719
- You got kids?
- No.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.678
- Yes, you do.
- Difference is I'm a fit father.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.799
I'm not murdering guys and little
girls, burying them, digging them up.

21:20.880 --> 21:25.112
Booth, I don't think he
murdered those people.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.350
You can tell by looking at his x-rays?

21:27.440 --> 21:32.833
He has the same genetic condition the
two victims had. A sternaI foramen.

21:33.720 --> 21:38.191
- They were probably his sister and his father.
- That true?

21:38.280 --> 21:44.833
Hey, buddy, you want to be on my good side,
cos I wasn'tjoking about keeping your kid.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.911
Yes.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.958
It was my sister. It was my father.

21:50.040 --> 21:55.239
Your father died of naturaI causes,
fine. But your sister was murdered.

21:56.840 --> 22:02.551
You know what? Forget it. Gang is the only
family he cares about. Enjoy your trip home.

22:02.640 --> 22:08.397
And have fun explaining to your wife
why she doesn't have a baby in her arms.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.194
Give us something.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.955
Help us to do the right
thing for your sister.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.838
- I cannot.
- Just anything.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.913
At least you could tell us their names.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.675
You want their names, huh?

22:30.920 --> 22:34.310
Duarte was our family name.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.795
María was my sister. Our
father was named Agustín.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.314
That's all I can tell you.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.319
- José's sister hated him.
- Why?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.789
She didn't approve of his associations.

22:53.880 --> 22:59.352
You mean associations like the leader of
one of the most murderous street gangs?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.431
If she hated José so
much, why did he move her?

23:01.520 --> 23:06.310
Their buriaI site was threatened. He wanted
to move her to a better place, and his father.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.595
ReaI family guy, you know?

23:09.720 --> 23:13.998
I'm not the leader of the
whole gang, just the DC chapter.

23:14.080 --> 23:17.038
You shot at us so José could
have a chance to get away?

23:17.120 --> 23:21.079
Mara Muerte takes care of its
own, even a throwaway like José.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.594
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.433
José's all beaten up so
he won't tell us anything.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.478
You don't even ask for a lawyer,
but you hardly stop talking.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.279
- Bones.
- Hey, I'm the boss, lady, OK?

23:32.360 --> 23:36.353
<i>José's a sobrinado.
He's not as smart as me.</i>

23:36.440 --> 23:38.510
You intimidate him into silence,

23:38.600 --> 23:43.674
but you can walk in to the FBI, say what you
want and walk away like you own the place?

23:43.760 --> 23:47.719
- That's right.
- Who would have the guts to kill his sister?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.392
Who cares, man?

23:49.480 --> 23:54.235
<i>- It's the most feared gang in the city.
- She wasn't my sister, man.</i>

23:54.320 --> 23:58.632
There had to be somebody else in the
gang, somebody more important than José.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.917
You know what, lady? You think too much.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.232
Maybe you need a man like me to get your
mind off things. You know what I'm saying?

24:06.320 --> 24:09.551
I can be your adorin' Salvadorian.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.550
I don't know who killed José's sister.

24:18.640 --> 24:24.909
But I'll tell you what. Because I like you so
much, if I find out who did it, I'll kill him.

24:37.240 --> 24:42.109
<i>You been waiting for me? Push that button
again and we can go down together, chulas.</i>

24:42.200 --> 24:45.795
You think you can intimidate
people into doing what you want?

24:45.880 --> 24:47.871
OK, I'll push it myself.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.676
How do you handle
someone who isn't afraid?

24:52.760 --> 24:55.149
Just get out of my way.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.959
I said move your ass, ma'am.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.473
I wouldn't...

25:01.920 --> 25:04.229
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.030
FeeI better?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.839
Yeah. I really do.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.433
- You beat up a gang leader?
- Booth told you that?

25:34.520 --> 25:39.036
You did. You got into a
fight with a gangbanger.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.595
- You're mad at me?
- The guy's a killer.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.752
Angela, relax. We were
in the FBI building.

25:45.840 --> 25:50.675
I know you're all about self-reliance
and standing up for yourself,

25:50.760 --> 25:55.834
but now, as your friend, and knowing
how much you hate psychology here,

25:55.920 --> 25:57.911
you need therapy.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.232
I'm sorry I upset you. It's just
that I've dealt with him before.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.029
- With who?
- People who get what they want through fear.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.588
Gangbangers, members of death squads.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.990
I know it's psychology again, but you said "him"
- one guy.

26:12.080 --> 26:17.473
I didn't mean Ortez specifically.
I meant people like him.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.116
- On my last trip to El Salvador...
- I remember.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.397
I tried to get you to
go to Italy with me.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.998
I was in a tent set up
by one of the grave sites.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.550
I was working with the
remains of a young girI.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.631
Maybe 13.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.919
She'd been shot in the
head and dumped into a well.

26:44.080 --> 26:49.234
This cop shows up and he might have
been a soldier, it's not easy to tell.

26:49.320 --> 26:53.108
I thought he was there to guard
me, but he told me to stop.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.839
When I refused, he called in two others.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.434
They put a bag over my head

26:58.520 --> 27:03.640
and tossed me into a cell with
a dirt floor and no windows.

27:03.720 --> 27:07.838
- For how long?
- Later I found out it was three days.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.390
But I thought it was a week, maybe more.

27:12.600 --> 27:17.355
He came in every day and made
me believe I was going to die.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.716
He said that he'd shoot
me and toss me into a well

27:20.800 --> 27:25.669
and that no one would ever know
who I was or what became of me.

27:27.440 --> 27:32.036
I promised myself, if I ever
had the chance, I'd get even.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.154
That doesn't mean I need therapy.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.319
I identified the type of wood
in the weapon that killed María.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.834
Am I interrupting a female moment?

27:48.920 --> 27:50.911
No. What was the wood?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.878
Quarter-sawn Cumaru. Definitely
not from a shoveI handle.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.633
What is made out of
quarter-sawn Cumaru?

27:56.720 --> 28:00.349
- Very expensive furniture.
- Senatorially expensive?

28:00.440 --> 28:02.590
Most definitely.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.397
- I don't recognise her, no.
- Neither do I, I'm afraid.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.835
- How about you, Hector?
- Her name was María.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.198
She used to work as a
maid here. She had papers.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.352
Fake ones. Probably supplied
by our neighbourhood gang.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.477
Hector couldn't be expected
to identify forged papers.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.630
What happened to María?

28:23.720 --> 28:26.678
One day she didn't show
up for work. That's all.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.320
Did she interact with
anyone here besides José?

28:29.400 --> 28:32.233
I don't know about that kind of thing.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.436
What kind of thing, Hector?

28:36.040 --> 28:38.235
I don't know anything.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.788
What do you mean, Hector?

28:43.680 --> 28:47.992
- Was María involved with the senator?
- What? Of course not!

28:48.080 --> 28:50.469
No.

28:50.560 --> 28:55.918
- No, not the senator.
- Well, tell the truth, Hector. This is the FBI.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.150
Logan.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.800
She was involved with Logan.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.756
What kind of involved?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.831
I'd rather not say.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.677
María's dead, Logan.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.631
María's dead?

29:18.240 --> 29:19.958
Yes.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.634
Of course that changes things.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.991
María and I were...

29:28.040 --> 29:31.476
What? Were lovers? Bones,
what the hell are you doing?

29:31.560 --> 29:34.028
How long have you had this bed?

29:35.200 --> 29:38.192
Since I was, like, 15. Why?

29:38.280 --> 29:40.396
Do you know what kind of wood it is?

29:40.480 --> 29:44.473
Curu... Cumaru,
something like that. Why?

29:44.560 --> 29:50.271
Because María's skull was banged in
by something made out of Cumaru wood.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.875
There's dried blood
and skin on this post.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.873
I caught María dancing
once in the hallway.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.476
She thought no one was
watching, but I was watching.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.636
I'd noticed her before.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.718
She was very pretty.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.154
More than what these pictures tell you.

30:23.240 --> 30:28.109
Logan, I will say again that I do not advise
answering questions. You're not under arrest.

30:28.200 --> 30:33.877
Perhaps you'd like to check with the senator
and see if he'd rather I arrested Logan.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.191
Because, you know, I'm sure
the press would love that.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.388
When did you start having
a sexuaI relationship?

30:41.480 --> 30:44.950
- Perhaps six months ago.
- You kept it a secret?

30:45.040 --> 30:49.352
María was certain that if my
parents found out, she'd be fired.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.635
Were you aware she was here illegally?

30:51.720 --> 30:53.995
I advise you: do not
answer that question.

30:54.080 --> 30:57.152
Were you aware that she was pregnant?

30:58.240 --> 31:00.549
María was pregnant?

31:02.680 --> 31:07.151
- There's no proof that you were the father.
- No. Shut up.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.431
Of course I'm the father.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.919
- And the father?
- A powerfuI man with a lot to lose.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.673
But why kill her? Why
not have her deported?

31:25.760 --> 31:28.399
- That leaves Hector.
- He hires the servants.

31:28.480 --> 31:32.439
I mean, one of them gets pregnant, he
feels like it's his mess to clean up.

31:32.520 --> 31:36.035
We still can't figure out how María's
skull was fractured by the bedpost.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.715
That's sort of your line of
work, Bones. So go have fun.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.115
<i>Your top three suspects
are Senator Corman, 6'1",</i>

31:44.200 --> 31:47.715
Logan Corman, 5'10", and
Hector Santiago, 5'6".

31:47.800 --> 31:49.711
María was 5'1".

31:49.800 --> 31:53.270
The bed is a California
King with seven-foot posts.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.831
<i>And assuming that they argued
near the foot of the bed...</i>

31:57.920 --> 32:01.037
Given their heights, the
angle of impact doesn't match.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.556
Her skull connects well below
where you found the traces of blood.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.835
What if they were standing on the bed?

32:06.920 --> 32:10.037
It's high enough, but her head
struck the outside of the post.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.671
How tall would her assailant
have to be to fit the evidence?

32:18.160 --> 32:21.118
- That... That's tall.
- 7'8".

32:21.200 --> 32:23.953
Somebody you'd notice around the house.

32:24.040 --> 32:27.237
- Let's think outside the box.
- What do you mean, go non-human?

32:27.320 --> 32:31.108
No. What else explains striking
the bedpost in that manner?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.430
I guess falling.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.592
Falling? María was a maid.

32:36.680 --> 32:40.275
Do you have a schematic
version of the room?

32:43.600 --> 32:46.114
If she fell backwards...

32:46.200 --> 32:49.078
But it doesn't explain the
damage done to her skull.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.197
What force does explain the damage?

32:52.280 --> 32:58.674
206 pounds per square inch, which means she
would've had to have fallen from a height of...

32:59.600 --> 33:02.512
- It's no good.
- I know what happened.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.875
She was yanked off the ladder.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.157
- You mean somebody pulled her off?
- Yes.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.390
The missing 84 pounds per square inch

33:10.480 --> 33:14.871
can be explained by a hard
yank from a full-grown man.

33:19.880 --> 33:25.034
I don't know if it's murder, but someone
is definitely responsible for María's death.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.308
This is not about the gang.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.631
The gang had nothing
to do with her death.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.598
María was pulled off that ladder.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.114
Who are you protecting?

33:37.200 --> 33:41.113
- I got nothing to say.
- What did the senator offer you?

33:41.200 --> 33:43.794
Asylum for the whole family?

33:44.800 --> 33:46.756
I know what happened.

33:46.840 --> 33:52.915
Your father died of cancer around
the same time your wife was pregnant.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.958
You wanted your child to
be born an American citizen.

33:56.040 --> 34:00.079
So you couldn't report your father's
death for fear of being deported.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.709
You buried him yourself, in the garden.

34:05.200 --> 34:10.069
And when your sister died, you
buried her in the same place.

34:11.040 --> 34:17.228
As my father died, he said to me,
"You take care of your sister. "

34:21.000 --> 34:26.757
You joined Mara Muerte so you could get fake
papers, so she could work for the senator.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.558
María...

34:28.639 --> 34:31.199
María, man, she was
so angry. She would...

34:31.280 --> 34:35.193
She'd get so angry, sometimes
she just didn't speak to me.

34:35.280 --> 34:38.590
She didn't understand what you
had to do for her and your family?

34:38.679 --> 34:43.275
It was the only way for me to
keep my promise to my father.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.670
Look at me now, huh?

34:48.760 --> 34:55.154
All because I wanted to give my sister
and my father a beautifuI place to rest.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.873
It's near... It's near a pond.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.751
It's beautifuI, huh?

35:06.160 --> 35:08.151
It's all for nothing.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.400
My family's ruined.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.275
- She didn't fall.
- No, she was pushed.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.638
No, Senator. Actually, she was
pulled. Probably off that ladder.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.871
- Pulled? Pulled by who?
- Perhaps by your son or the senator.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.669
Oh, my God! I do not
pull maids off of ladders.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.877
- Will you please open that up?
- Why would they do that?

35:31.960 --> 35:35.077
- Because María was pregnant by your son.
- What?!

35:35.160 --> 35:39.073
Even if that were true, that is not
how we would handle the situation.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.754
- You'd have her deported.
- It would be handled.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.230
And not by pulling her off a ladder.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.118
Senator, would you mind reaching up?

35:48.200 --> 35:51.078
- What is that gonna prove?
- Are you refusing, sir?

35:51.160 --> 35:53.833
I'm trained in kinesiology,
the study of human movement.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.673
And you're gonna be able
to tell who pulled her off?

35:56.760 --> 36:00.958
- Absolutely, yes.
- Oh, for God sake, Alan. Just do it. Just do it.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.031
Fine.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.918
Well? Was it me?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.958
<i>- Hector?
- Si?</i>

36:13.040 --> 36:16.191
Would you please pull
me down off this ladder?

36:16.280 --> 36:18.919
No. No, I won't.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.230
Hector, just do as she asks.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.758
Hector.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.590
How did it happen, Hector?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.830
You told her to stay
out of Logan's room.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.718
You didn't approve. You
knew what was going on.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.588
- Hector?
- If it wasn't you, just pull me down.

36:37.480 --> 36:41.712
María defied you. She went to Logan's room.
You got angry. You pulled her off the ladder.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.360
It was an accident.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.469
Yeah... It was an accident.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.639
- I can't believe that worked.
- Psychology. It's a very powerfuI force.

36:58.720 --> 37:03.191
I gave her 500 dollars
and I drove her home.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.510
I thought she was gonna go to a doctor.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.909
She was afraid she'd get deported.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.436
- You should have told us.
- You don't want to know.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.637
You don't want to
know about any of this.

37:14.720 --> 37:18.190
I know my job. I know what you want.

37:20.640 --> 37:26.829
Hector Alvarado, I'm placing you under
arrest on suspicion of manslaughter.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.238
Booth? A message from
the Gang Task Force Unit.

37:38.320 --> 37:42.598
Mara Muerte has put a hit
out on your lady scientist.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.311
- Oh, man.
- Any response?

37:45.400 --> 37:48.915
Yeah. Just tell 'em...
tell 'em I got the message.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.389
- And tell 'em thanks.
- Sure.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.993
<i>Señor, acepta en tus brazos
las almas de tus hijos devotos,</i>

38:05.080 --> 38:08.072
<i>María Duarte y Agustín Duarte.</i>

38:08.160 --> 38:13.792
<i>Que tu Espíritu Santo los ilumine,
dándoles bienvenida en tu amor.</i>

38:13.880 --> 38:18.192
<i>Padre Nuestro que estás en los
Cielos, santificado sea tu nombre.</i>

38:18.280 --> 38:23.559
<i>Véngase tu reino. Hágase tu voluntad
en la Tierra como en el Cielo.</i>

38:23.640 --> 38:28.236
<i>Danos hoy nuestro pan de cada día, y
perdona nuestras ofensas, así como...</i>

38:28.320 --> 38:33.792
This is nice of you. Not many people
would pay for a funeraI like this.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.678
Where's Booth? He said he'd come.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.233
- Are you crazy?
- You put a hit out on my partner?

39:01.320 --> 39:05.757
She's not FBI. I never
said anything about FBI.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.752
<i>She's my partner, esé! And
if anything happens to her,</i>

39:08.840 --> 39:12.196
I will find you and I will
kill you. I won't think twice.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.317
Come here. Look in my
eyes. Look at my face.

39:15.400 --> 39:20.474
If anything happens to her, I will
kill you. This is between you and me.

39:20.560 --> 39:25.429
And nobody sees, nobody knows. You
got nothing to prove. Understand?

39:25.520 --> 39:27.511
You understand?

39:28.920 --> 39:35.109
I thought so. Now, if you don't mind, I'll leave
first because I have somewhere I have to be.

39:46.160 --> 39:50.233
- I will pay you back for this funeraI.
- Don't worry about it.

39:50.320 --> 39:54.950
- It's my family. It's my duty.
- Aren't you leaving for El Salvador tonight?

39:55.040 --> 39:57.508
Well, my child is an American.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.318
He's...

40:01.400 --> 40:03.994
He's not gonna grow up the
way that Rosa and I did.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.709
<i>Lo regresamos, de alguna manera.</i>

40:07.800 --> 40:12.078
- She says that we're gonna bring him back.
- I understand.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.631
One way or another, your son will
have a better life than you did.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.915
<i>- Gracias.
- Gracias.</i>

40:30.080 --> 40:35.234
- Am I in trouble?
- You're late for a funeraI. Of course you are.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.279
Sorry.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.510
I apologise.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.558
- Everything OK here?
- Where were you?

40:43.080 --> 40:47.471
- I had something to do.
- More important than a funeraI?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.675
I thought so at the time.
