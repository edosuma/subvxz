us on the front page.

00:28.130 --> 00:29.565

00:29.588 --> 00:31.607
We're soon to be joined

How can I possibly send you out on this?

00:34.021 --> 00:35.225
It has to be me.

00:35.258 --> 00:36.861
If they knew that I was a soldier,

00:36.889 --> 00:38.054
they'd behead me.

01:44.752 --> 01:46.850
Bruising but no laceration.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.548
Need to get you checked out, though.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.341
CT scan and X-ray for you.

01:50.352 --> 01:51.795
Yeah, I'm fine. I can take a punch.

01:51.817 --> 01:53.498
You can give one, and all.

01:55.613 --> 01:56.789

01:57.344 --> 01:58.604

we've got some fluid into you.

02:56.022 --> 02:57.731
You might want to
check my bloods as well.

02:57.776 --> 02:59.628
I haven't passed urine for 12 hours.

SHE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

03:09.794 --> 03:11.864
I'm a bit bloody relieved to
see you in one piece, Lane.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.478
Well done.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.105
I'm proud of you.

03:31.998 --> 03:34.250
You must think I'm an emotional wreck.

03:34.539 --> 03:36.130
What, you think I don't cry?

03:42.258 --> 03:44.506
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to Kicki.

03:46.831 --> 03:48.967
The thing with our
job is, we can't unsee

03:48.983 --> 03:50.376
the things we've seen.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.823
And I've seen.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.673
Was it as hellish as I can imagine?

03:56.793 --> 03:57.938
Oh...

03:58.404 --> 04:01.201
I just don't understand
how people can be so evil.

04:03.932 --> 04:06.085
When you speak to the psychiatrist,

04:06.441 --> 04:08.538
you must properly unload, OK?

04:09.925 --> 04:11.490
What, don't you think I will?

04:12.677 --> 04:14.469
I think you'll say you're fine

04:14.503 --> 04:16.267
and that you want to
get back to work ASAP.

04:17.749 --> 04:19.536
Yeah, well, I AM fine.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.017
I rest my case.

04:22.966 --> 04:23.909
What does that mean?

04:23.926 --> 04:26.190
It means, don't go
giving it all "I'm fine".

04:27.130 --> 04:30.010
Please, tell them everything.

04:30.641 --> 04:33.094
You might end up with
the psychiatrist in tears.

04:33.130 --> 04:34.337
So be it.

04:44.130 --> 04:46.130
- You want to talk to him?
- No.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.387
Why him, boss?

04:49.394 --> 04:52.124
- It wasn't my call, Lane.
- Can you imagine how I felt?

04:52.127 --> 04:55.109
Our first priority was
to get you back safely.

04:55.387 --> 04:58.223
Well, the second priority
is to tell him to go.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.082
Seriously.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.489
Did Abu escape?

05:36.925 --> 05:38.429
The British guy?

06:08.130 --> 06:10.959
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

06:13.716 --> 06:15.130
Lads!

06:15.511 --> 06:17.228
Come with me.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.366
Missed you.

06:25.655 --> 06:28.307
Stop making it weird, man.

06:34.705 --> 06:36.187
Not too shabby, eh, Lane?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.432
It's a completely safe zone.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.175
We expecting trouble?

06:42.496 --> 06:44.522
Stay alert, stay alive.

06:44.888 --> 06:46.264
It's not just Al-Shabaab sympathisers.

06:46.292 --> 06:48.112
Pirates work this coast too.

06:48.584 --> 06:49.704
Yeah, right!

06:50.470 --> 06:52.107
They're not eye-patch pirates, Lane.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.900
They're just called pirates.

06:54.020 --> 06:56.796
Basically make their living
robbing ships on the high seas.

06:56.974 --> 07:00.442
But some rob, kidnap
and kill tourists, too.

07:01.058 --> 07:03.130
Everyone has to make a
living, I guess, boss.

07:06.457 --> 07:09.010
There's always a price
to pay for paradise.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.030
Well, look who it is.

07:31.096 --> 07:32.850
- After you.
- Thank you.

07:33.105 --> 07:34.725
- Hello!
- Hi!

07:35.130 --> 07:36.112
Come on, then.

07:36.545 --> 07:38.792
Where have you been
hiding, you little skiver?

07:39.286 --> 07:40.513
What d'you do, Lane?

07:40.540 --> 07:42.926
Whine at the Al-Shabaab like
a Scouser till they let you go?

07:42.949 --> 07:44.812
- She isn't a Scouser, Monk.
- I'm a Manc, Monk.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.571
Same difference. If
you're not on the Tube,

07:46.577 --> 07:47.925
you're all Northern to me.

07:47.948 --> 07:49.698
Monk could have been
singing like a canary

07:49.702 --> 07:51.010
at the first thumbscrew.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.865
I did actually waterboard
my mate with lager.

07:52.921 --> 07:54.341
So, you lager-boarded him, then?

07:55.623 --> 07:56.789
- Brilliant to have you back.
- Aw...

07:56.794 --> 07:57.782
Thanks for that.

07:57.821 --> 07:59.746
- Stiffy klaxon.
- Honk!

08:00.384 --> 08:01.949
Aw, Kingy. Hi.

08:01.994 --> 08:03.830
- Welcome back to the fold, Lance Corporal.
- Thank you.

08:03.853 --> 08:06.255
Come on then, boss, what do you
say, can we start drinking or what?

08:06.316 --> 08:07.792
No, still on duty.

08:07.848 --> 08:10.926
R R doesn't begin until
Lane finishes her debriefing.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.525
Then we R R together.

08:12.536 --> 08:14.456
One in, all in, yeah?

08:14.700 --> 08:17.330
- That's correct, Monk.
- Easy.

08:21.804 --> 08:23.546
Uh-uh.

08:24.612 --> 08:25.772
No.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.330
No.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.653
Kenyan security are monitoring borders.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.744
- So, he's still in Kenya?
- Almost certainly.

08:34.864 --> 08:37.857
Lying low in a safe house
somewhere, not knowing who to trust.

08:37.861 --> 08:40.299
Well, he'll be aware
that we have covert agents

08:40.316 --> 08:42.010
embedded in Al-Shabaab cells.

08:42.024 --> 08:43.871
We know where he is?
Or where he might be?

08:44.350 --> 08:46.825
How many white converts
have we got floating around?

08:46.891 --> 08:49.759
We are aware of how urgent
the current situation is.

08:50.536 --> 08:52.877
You hold the most
significant of all intel.

08:52.888 --> 08:54.669
You can identify the entire cell.

08:54.789 --> 08:58.437
Not just Abu but his superiors
in their chain of command.

08:58.459 --> 09:00.773
I didn't have much
time in their ops room.

09:00.978 --> 09:03.952
But enough time to see detailed
plans of this shopping mall.

09:04.446 --> 09:07.010
After what happened in
Nairobi in the Westgate Mall...

09:07.027 --> 09:08.952
Well, that's why you need to
be as precise as you can be,

09:08.985 --> 09:10.811
so we can identify the target.

09:11.130 --> 09:14.418
I saw photos of a, erm...

09:15.434 --> 09:18.409
... a... a bird, I think. Poppies...

09:18.529 --> 09:20.623
- You think a bird?
- Yes, sir.

09:21.073 --> 09:22.238
A statue.

09:22.358 --> 09:23.897
But I'm not 100% sure.

09:25.683 --> 09:27.365
I saw, erm,

09:27.598 --> 09:29.085
Google images.

09:29.989 --> 09:33.702
Aerial photographs printed
from an internet type of thing.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.861
You'd definitely recognise him?

09:36.332 --> 09:39.798
- Intelligence suggests he's from London.
- Yes, sir. It's London.

09:39.918 --> 09:41.747
All video surveillance from Kenya

09:41.760 --> 09:43.119
and across the Somali border

09:43.130 --> 09:45.049
is being scrutinised
for white insurgents.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.074
He will be found. It's
just a matter of time.

09:47.194 --> 09:48.010
Exactly.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.738
Time.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.543
We need to get him before he gets us.

09:56.952 --> 09:58.416
I'd recognise him, sir.

09:59.428 --> 10:00.431
Without a doubt.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.130
Never forget those eyes.

10:10.781 --> 10:11.660
Stop.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.130
Is it him?

10:17.999 --> 10:20.379
Obviously he looked different.
He... he had a beard.

10:21.481 --> 10:22.746
Are you sure?

10:25.471 --> 10:26.368
Yeah.

10:26.736 --> 10:28.130
Yeah, it's him, sir.

10:28.818 --> 10:29.857
Who is he?

10:30.891 --> 10:33.493
Jason Raynott. Born north London.

10:33.702 --> 10:35.274
University of Manchester.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.696
Converted to Islam as an undergraduate.

10:38.816 --> 10:40.774
Last known whereabouts,
flew from Heathrow

10:40.779 --> 10:44.010
to Ethiopia on a tourist
visa on 14/4/2016.

10:44.273 --> 10:45.760
No trace since.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.478
We're getting somewhere, Lane.

10:49.928 --> 10:52.388
APP RINGS

10:53.675 --> 10:54.617
Got you.

10:55.314 --> 10:56.130
At last.

10:56.335 --> 10:57.969
Oh, the connection's so bad here.

10:57.995 --> 11:00.446
No, no, I can see you.
Fantastic. Are you OK?

11:00.659 --> 11:01.520
Yeah.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.130
Yeah, you know me.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.539
You had a full check at the hospital?

11:04.561 --> 11:06.010
Yes, everything's fine.

11:06.026 --> 11:07.456
Level's stabilised now?

11:07.576 --> 11:10.213
Hm, honestly, I'm fine, I'm fine.

11:10.444 --> 11:11.988
I'm as normal as I've ever been.

11:12.690 --> 11:15.010
Your text from the hospital
said they were taking bloods?

11:15.518 --> 11:17.240
Yeah, well, that was just, you know,

11:17.453 --> 11:19.402
a precaution because of the dehydration.

11:19.948 --> 11:21.480
Did they put you on a saline drip?

11:21.737 --> 11:24.197
Yes, as soon as I got to the hospital.

11:24.592 --> 11:25.995
Any headaches since?

11:26.239 --> 11:27.895
No. I'm fine.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.507
Look, get them to send
me your blood results

11:29.516 --> 11:31.944
so I can get them to a hospital
here for when you get home.

11:32.130 --> 11:33.693
Stop fussing.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.077
I'm fine.

11:35.078 --> 11:38.129
Right, tell me, tell me,
you know, how is everyone?

11:38.130 --> 11:39.576
Tell me how you are.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.870
We've been at panic stations.

11:44.388 --> 11:45.937
But I can see you

11:47.167 --> 11:49.130
so it makes me feel a whole lot better.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.582
I'm so looking forward
to getting home now.

11:54.323 --> 11:55.216
I bet.

11:56.534 --> 11:57.702
You look tired.

11:58.643 --> 11:59.522
Thanks.

12:00.338 --> 12:03.859
I heard about your...
your fellow hostage.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.064
I hope you didn't have
to see any of that.

12:08.346 --> 12:09.820
Thank God they got you out.

12:11.906 --> 12:14.130
Those boys who rescued you, they...

12:15.032 --> 12:16.395
they...

12:16.705 --> 12:18.583
they know what they're doing, huh?

12:20.457 --> 12:22.130
We owe them a pint or three.

12:34.947 --> 12:36.962
Well, knock me down with a feather.

12:38.354 --> 12:39.547
Did you sort this out?

12:39.724 --> 12:41.294
So you could be in the
room next door to me?

12:41.305 --> 12:43.292
Cos that is really fucking creepy,

12:43.514 --> 12:45.334
and 100% you all over.

12:47.371 --> 12:49.679
That vein thing on your
forehead's happening again.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.442
- What?
- Remember.

12:51.443 --> 12:52.365
I told you whenever you used to cry,

12:52.387 --> 12:54.118
that vein thing used to
pop up on your forehead.

12:54.146 --> 12:56.765
Yeah, well, I'm not crying
so don't flatter yourself, OK?

12:57.130 --> 12:57.130
Yeah, well, I'm not crying
so don't flatter yourself, OK?

13:03.979 --> 13:06.130
- Listen, Georgie...
- Elvis, no.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.738
You won't even give me one
minute to explain, will ya?

13:39.393 --> 13:41.879
- Raisins!
- Can you do me some chips?

13:41.890 --> 13:43.737
- Oh, this bacon is...
- Get in my belly.

13:43.754 --> 13:45.363
Look at that.

13:45.385 --> 13:47.095
- All right, lads?
- Here, Georgie.

13:47.123 --> 13:49.319
- Fill your boots. We're all inclusive.
- What we got?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.884
Better than that slop
you're having as a hostage.

13:50.895 --> 13:53.248
Most of what I had was better
than rations. Thank you.

13:53.368 --> 13:54.696
Fruit and coffee for me.

13:54.957 --> 13:56.300
Eye of the needle, Klaxon.

13:56.322 --> 13:58.647
They can do you eggs
any which way you fancy.

13:58.675 --> 14:00.512
I know, I've got me omelette
cooking, all the trimmings.

14:00.528 --> 14:01.782
What are the trimmings?

14:01.902 --> 14:04.065
I think chips. But they won't
be as good as they are at home.

14:04.068 --> 14:05.361
Well, there's no curry sauce, is there?

14:05.394 --> 14:07.253
- Yeah, they've got ketchup.
- No.

14:07.297 --> 14:08.973
You're not putting that on
your fruit, are you, Brains?

14:12.097 --> 14:13.068
Lane.

14:13.218 --> 14:14.511
- Come here.
- Oh.

14:15.649 --> 14:17.341
- Boss.
- Lost her again.

14:17.574 --> 14:20.188
We think we've located Abu and his cell.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.106
Credible intel of a gathering,

14:22.107 --> 14:23.472
possible council of war.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.610
Now, we don't have a target

14:24.621 --> 14:25.813
but while intercepting phone calls,

14:25.814 --> 14:28.539
we picked up several
keywords signifying an attack.

14:28.544 --> 14:31.246
And all indications are
that the attack is imminent.

14:31.434 --> 14:33.216
We're going to join close observations

14:33.227 --> 14:35.208
and wait for them all to be
assembled in one place together.

14:35.385 --> 14:37.010
Then we'll eliminate the target.

14:37.130 --> 14:39.820
One option is for special forces
to go in and try to send back

14:39.853 --> 14:42.705
images of cell members
for you to identify.

14:42.766 --> 14:44.525
That's going to rely
on satellite imagery

14:44.536 --> 14:45.890
which is intermittent, at best.

14:46.057 --> 14:48.814
We could send you out on
another mission with them.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.200
Purely for observation and
identification purposes.

14:51.211 --> 14:52.721
We will not be engaging.

14:52.765 --> 14:54.746
I'll be fine to go, boss,
if that's what you're asking.

14:54.774 --> 14:57.760
- It's not a necessity, Lane.
- Well, it makes logical sense.

14:57.938 --> 15:01.328
I can ID them and the
mission can be completed.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.474
It save's faffing around and
sending pictures back and forward.

15:04.507 --> 15:05.572
Right,

15:05.692 --> 15:07.781
well, we'd like you to pop and
see the doctor before you go.

15:07.797 --> 15:10.704
If you're happy to go.

15:11.130 --> 15:13.362
Seriously, Lane, no-one
would doubt your bravery.

15:13.756 --> 15:15.143
Perhaps you could do
without another mission

15:15.144 --> 15:16.964
- so soon after.
- I'm fine.

15:17.169 --> 15:19.451
I'll be sat in the back
of a truck IDing people.

15:20.233 --> 15:23.130
Unless you don't think I can
do it because I'm a woman?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.130
- No-one is suggesting that.
- Good.

15:26.603 --> 15:29.272
Then I best go and pack
my kit in readiness.

15:29.444 --> 15:31.863
It's near the refugee camp so
we can use the Kenyan base there.

15:31.891 --> 15:33.794
It's 110% safe.

15:33.914 --> 15:35.204
OK.

15:35.654 --> 15:38.799
The sooner we can conclude
this, the sooner I can go home.

15:39.709 --> 15:42.761
To be honest, this is the best
thing that could have happened,

15:43.483 --> 15:44.920
full stop, sir.

15:49.103 --> 15:51.539
Close surveillance have
been monitoring this house

15:51.571 --> 15:53.126
for Al-Shabaab activity.

15:54.563 --> 15:58.642
He was smuggled into the
dwelling a couple of hours ago.

16:00.284 --> 16:01.771
I'm sure that's him.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.188
That's him.

16:06.194 --> 16:07.403
- That's Abu?
- Yeah.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.957
100%, Lane?

16:09.018 --> 16:10.294
No room for error.

16:10.526 --> 16:12.546
Can you confirm that's a positive ID?

16:12.666 --> 16:13.867
That's him?

16:13.930 --> 16:15.676
Yeah. That's Abu.

16:16.048 --> 16:17.174
Confirm.

17:14.446 --> 17:16.086
Visitors.

17:26.603 --> 17:30.054
SHUTTER OPENS AND CLOSES

17:38.330 --> 17:40.555
- OK, zoom in.
- What have we got?

17:42.330 --> 17:44.486
That's Gaani. He's the cell commander.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.723
Anything on the one on the left?

17:47.699 --> 17:48.936
Yeah, he was definitely there.

17:48.947 --> 17:50.723
But I had no direct contact with him.

17:52.522 --> 17:54.542
- He's Al-Shabaab?
- Yeah.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.778
Good stuff, Lane.

17:58.531 --> 18:01.056
Eh, don't start feeling
sorry for him yet, Georgie.

18:01.176 --> 18:02.771
I'm not feeling sorry for 'im, Spanner.

18:02.804 --> 18:05.174
I'm feeling sorry for Kicki. Right?

18:06.056 --> 18:08.936
- Picking anything up yet, boss?
- Nothing. Sound's too muffled.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.698
Any English?

18:10.903 --> 18:13.022
Don't know, it's too hard to
tell. We need to get in closer.

18:13.056 --> 18:16.056
SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE THROUGH RADIO

18:16.130 --> 18:17.811
Osman, can we get in closer?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.791
We know it's him. Lane
has confirmed as much.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.056
Not worth trying to find out
what their target was, no?

18:24.098 --> 18:26.056
We want to send in air support.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.888
The house is on its own, boss.

18:27.904 --> 18:29.369
No collateral.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.929
Ruhusa ya kutumia jet, Tambua. Bomb.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.753
JETS APPROACH QUICKLY

19:07.258 --> 19:09.056
Shit.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.056
Jambo.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.820
Think that's what
they call a bull's-eye.

19:16.278 --> 19:18.056
All clear.

19:34.056 --> 19:36.674
That must have felt very
fucking good, Georgie.

19:36.688 --> 19:38.776
Knowing that twat's been red misted?

19:39.056 --> 19:41.308
I'd have preferred him
brought back to the UK,

19:41.453 --> 19:43.645
made him face up to what he'd done.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.056
Really?

19:47.266 --> 19:48.854
He got off easy.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.056
Over in a second and...

19:52.725 --> 19:54.667
... I'll have him in there a lifetime.

19:55.506 --> 19:57.056
And that's not right.

19:58.703 --> 20:00.500
Oi.

20:01.056 --> 20:03.156
He's still got to face
his God, though, eh?

20:14.166 --> 20:16.255
It's our job, Georgie.

20:16.628 --> 20:18.553
- You know what I mean?
- Hm.

20:19.056 --> 20:21.440
We serve our country,
George. It's what we do.

20:22.207 --> 20:24.056
Do you ever doubt why we do it?

20:26.320 --> 20:28.602
Listen, we've both
lost people in the past.

20:28.722 --> 20:31.162
If I could go back
and save them, I would.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.368
But I've never doubted what I've done.

20:33.909 --> 20:35.608
And neither should you.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.507
We do our duty, don't we?

20:40.311 --> 20:42.056
It's what makes us.

20:42.829 --> 20:45.139
I need to do something to get closure.

20:45.259 --> 20:47.545
- It won't delay us.
- OK.

20:49.056 --> 20:51.056
You don't know what it is.

20:52.056 --> 20:55.056
You want to go back to the
refugee camp and see Nafula.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.976
Come on, what else would it have been?

21:00.330 --> 21:02.751
I read the brief and your role in it.

21:13.335 --> 21:16.187
I'm sure Kicki would have
wanted Nafula to have this.

21:50.056 --> 21:51.978
I know what I'm doing.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.267
I know.

22:15.695 --> 22:17.709
I didn't think you'd come back.

22:18.056 --> 22:19.603
Well, I was just passing.

22:20.691 --> 22:22.661
I can't believe they shot her.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.256
Why?

22:24.686 --> 22:26.178
Unforgivable.

22:26.718 --> 22:28.002
My friend,

22:28.009 --> 22:31.387
I need you to understand this
has nothing to do with Islam.

22:31.507 --> 22:33.877
This is just... a madness.

22:34.342 --> 22:36.055
It's made us stronger.

22:36.056 --> 22:38.192
And one day we will defeat them.

22:40.370 --> 22:42.395
But we can't beat them, can we?

22:42.437 --> 22:45.281
- We can never beat those extreme people.
- We can.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.055
And we will.

22:47.056 --> 22:50.055
If people like you carry on
doing exactly what you're doing,

22:50.056 --> 22:52.127
making sure the good outweighs the bad.

22:52.141 --> 22:54.173
- But they will never stop.
- Neither will we.

22:54.908 --> 22:57.056
We try to stop the fear.

22:58.591 --> 23:00.083
The fear?

23:00.388 --> 23:03.281
The only way we can
be beaten is with fear.

23:03.621 --> 23:06.492
So, people like us need to stand
up and say we're not afraid.

23:07.056 --> 23:08.573
They can't win.

23:08.802 --> 23:10.175
We win.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.825
Kicki wins.

23:14.955 --> 23:17.028
Do you want to know my
best bits about soldiering?

23:17.056 --> 23:18.652
Yes.

23:19.179 --> 23:23.445
Doing security for
the Olympics in London,

23:23.708 --> 23:27.766
working on the flood
relief in Cumbria...

23:28.529 --> 23:30.318
... and...

23:32.573 --> 23:34.362
And what?

23:34.861 --> 23:36.394
... working here,

23:37.393 --> 23:39.626
in the refugee camp with you.

23:48.596 --> 23:50.413
One minute, Georgie.

23:53.631 --> 23:55.171
Someone special?

23:56.322 --> 23:58.064
He thinks he is.

23:59.548 --> 24:01.130
Do you?

24:03.210 --> 24:06.055
No. He was just checking if...

24:06.056 --> 24:09.056
- You are OK?
- Yes. Yes, he was, yeah.

24:10.077 --> 24:11.672
He's handsome, huh?

24:12.428 --> 24:14.370
On the surface, yeah.

24:20.294 --> 24:21.806
Here.

24:35.165 --> 24:36.788
Thank you.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.475
You OK?

25:06.182 --> 25:07.725
I want a beer, man.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.738
- Listen in, guys!
- I'm only joking.

25:10.965 --> 25:13.679
The work on Lane's de-brief
has now been completed.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.695
CHEERING

25:15.696 --> 25:17.047
Don't touch her weave, man.

25:17.086 --> 25:18.806
It's all my own, thanks, Dangles.

25:19.239 --> 25:22.097
So, after considerable,
lengthy and somewhat

25:22.130 --> 25:24.100
heated negotiations with the MoD,

25:24.105 --> 25:27.812
we have now been granted 48 hours R R...

25:27.862 --> 25:29.299
with...

25:29.419 --> 25:30.687
beer rations.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.685
- What?
- Now, please,

25:32.701 --> 25:35.320
please remember we are
visitors in this country

25:35.337 --> 25:37.968
and representing Her Majesty.

26:06.696 --> 26:08.409
I'm thinking of joining the Paras, me.

26:08.529 --> 26:11.676
- Ha!
- Yes, yes!

26:11.696 --> 26:12.614
What?

26:12.653 --> 26:14.240
What's occurring here
then, you little wankers?

26:14.246 --> 26:16.161
Georgie had a bet with
me, Monk and Brains

26:16.189 --> 26:18.298
that you'd bang on
about joining the Paras.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.674
Up there for thinking, mate.

26:19.794 --> 26:22.104
- See, I like Two Section, me.
- Me, too.

26:22.224 --> 26:24.019
I need to push on from my comfort zone.

26:24.258 --> 26:25.612
You still live with your nan.

26:27.316 --> 26:28.608
I stay with my nan
when I'm on home leave

26:28.642 --> 26:30.267
- cos she needs looking after.
- Aw.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.670
Does she still take the top off
your eggs in the morning, Fingers?

26:32.696 --> 26:34.696
Come on, Brains. Hand it over.

26:35.849 --> 26:38.463
I will not let this
change my life, thank you.

26:39.405 --> 26:40.543
Where are you going?

26:40.731 --> 26:43.162
- Get away from you lot.
- I don't blame you.

26:43.528 --> 26:44.843
Seriously, though,

26:44.963 --> 26:47.576
I might see if there's a way I can
join special forces straight away.

26:47.619 --> 26:50.337
Yeah, you ignore these lot.
You go ahead and progress, mate.

26:50.370 --> 26:52.917
You might have to start eating your
spinach tonight then, eh, Fingers?

27:05.277 --> 27:06.696
Here.

27:10.393 --> 27:11.815
Thought we were friends again.

27:11.849 --> 27:14.118
No. What made you think that?

27:14.423 --> 27:15.887
Cos we had a deal.

27:17.018 --> 27:18.696
No.

27:20.340 --> 27:21.867
I got you to the camp, didn't I?

27:22.276 --> 27:24.576
A tin-opener helps me get to my beans.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.049
It's useful.

27:26.261 --> 27:27.681
I'm not interested in
talking to it, though.

27:27.696 --> 27:30.144
- But maybe I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, well, maybe I'm not listening.

27:30.264 --> 27:31.776
That makes you sound so stupid.

27:31.787 --> 27:32.736
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

27:32.758 --> 27:34.135
- All right.
- Yeah, none so deaf

27:34.151 --> 27:37.312
- as those that will not hear, right?
- Just leave me alone, Elvis.

27:47.278 --> 27:48.838
Now's not the time, mate.

27:49.931 --> 27:51.541
Anyway, you had your chance.

27:52.523 --> 27:53.695
Meaning?

27:53.696 --> 27:56.291
She's happy and she's settled.

27:56.713 --> 27:58.300
Don't screw things up for her.

27:59.332 --> 28:02.201
- I just want to explain.
- She's just been held hostage, Elvis.

28:02.451 --> 28:03.910
Think about where her head's at.

28:04.454 --> 28:06.235
Anyway, you should try and move on.

28:06.355 --> 28:08.255
- She has.
- All right.

28:09.032 --> 28:11.529
Look, the one thing you
can't change is the past,

28:11.696 --> 28:13.294
and you blew it, my friend.

28:13.344 --> 28:14.695
And you think I don't know that?

28:14.696 --> 28:16.789
- You made a tough choice.
- Yeah,

28:17.699 --> 28:18.848
was I right to?

28:18.870 --> 28:20.696
Well, now you've got to stick
to that decision, haven't you?

28:20.996 --> 28:23.321
It's time to start being
a grown-up about it, Elvis.

28:26.051 --> 28:27.610
Say I made the wrong decision.

28:27.666 --> 28:28.898
Don't confuse her.

28:28.921 --> 28:30.464
And how am I confusing her?

28:30.584 --> 28:32.696
You've just swept in and rescued her.

28:33.204 --> 28:34.563
Right now she might remember you

28:34.564 --> 28:36.456
as something that's
not totally a bad thing.

28:36.696 --> 28:38.475
You keep on digging, she's
only ever going to remember you

28:38.476 --> 28:39.964
for what you put her through.

28:42.222 --> 28:44.696
APP RINGS

29:08.049 --> 29:10.130
Hi, how are you?

29:10.383 --> 29:11.764
Hey, I've been trying
to get you for ages.

29:11.787 --> 29:13.041
Has it not been ringing?

29:13.068 --> 29:15.360
No. You got me now, so...

29:15.621 --> 29:16.925
So, what you been up to?

29:17.230 --> 29:18.429
Nothing.

29:19.095 --> 29:20.793
- Looking after yourself?
- Mm, yeah.

29:21.125 --> 29:22.140
Good stuff.

29:23.211 --> 29:25.236
What's that noise? You're
not having a party, are you?

29:25.802 --> 29:27.334
Oh, it's from the beach.

29:27.356 --> 29:30.054
That's the sound of the
finest fighting force,

29:30.120 --> 29:32.576
feared across all continents,

29:32.995 --> 29:35.253
getting pissed out of their tiny minds,

29:35.254 --> 29:37.274
building a human pyramid.

29:37.394 --> 29:38.623
Go figure.

29:38.634 --> 29:40.853
Well, that's exactly where
I'd be if I was out there.

29:42.696 --> 29:44.787
- Where?
- On the beach, partying.

29:44.907 --> 29:46.696
Hm. Can't be arsed.

29:47.123 --> 29:49.471
Come on. Get out and try and relax.

29:49.826 --> 29:51.396
No. I'm tired.

29:52.423 --> 29:54.054
I'll look after you when you get home.

29:55.897 --> 29:59.060
Oh, look, there she is.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.878
- Oh, there's our girl.
- How are you, Georgie, eh?

30:01.901 --> 30:04.958
Oh, don't come too close!
You'll bloody scare me to death!

30:05.657 --> 30:08.248
Oh. We've been in a right
state, haven't we, Max?

30:09.242 --> 30:10.430
Been worried sick, love.

30:10.441 --> 30:12.954
Yeah. Thank God we've had
Jamie here, keeping us calm.

30:13.398 --> 30:14.880
He's been above and beyond, this lad.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.883
- That's true.
- THEY LAUGH

30:17.693 --> 30:19.209
Oh, love you.

31:01.096 --> 31:03.397
- THEY CHEER
- OK, here we go.

31:03.517 --> 31:05.756
Hey! Oh!

31:07.073 --> 31:08.976
- Ah!
- Hey, someone!

31:09.096 --> 31:10.550
- Hello, mate.
- Hi.

31:10.571 --> 31:12.055
- Come on, babe.
- Come and get the ball.

31:12.096 --> 31:15.394
- No, you guys carry on.
- Come on, show us your mad skills.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.555
- THEY CHEER
- Here we go, here we go.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.921
Not a bad kick.

31:21.642 --> 31:24.406
- Oh!
- OK. OK.

31:25.626 --> 31:27.662
What's that, a handstand? What?

31:27.668 --> 31:30.104
Perfect form! Perfect form!

31:30.420 --> 31:32.368
Ten points!

31:42.096 --> 31:44.778
DISTORTED MUSIC

31:58.813 --> 32:01.096
GUNSHOT

32:19.090 --> 32:20.685
Do you want a bevvy?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.472
No, ta.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.486
You not a beer drinker?

32:24.786 --> 32:26.789
I'm sophisticated. I drink
gin and tonic, thanks!

32:26.850 --> 32:28.709
Is that sophisticated, is it?

32:28.986 --> 32:31.628
My nan drinks gin and
she's got a face tattoo.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.479
Shame we can't get in the sea.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.904
- Health and safety.
- Yeah, maybe.

32:37.204 --> 32:38.685
Can't imagine one of these boys

32:38.718 --> 32:41.116
- jumping in to save a drowning Brit.
- No.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.755
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:58.764 --> 32:59.975
Right, guys.

33:00.031 --> 33:01.668
Truck's just cleared through security.

33:02.578 --> 33:04.487
Nairobi calling, boys.

33:10.747 --> 33:12.045
I'll catch you up.

33:32.458 --> 33:33.835
Georgie!

33:56.096 --> 33:57.486
I'm sorry.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.679
WOMAN SCREAMS: Stop him!

34:16.799 --> 34:19.094
Somebody stop him!

34:19.096 --> 34:22.067
No, please help! Someone stop him!

34:22.096 --> 34:25.096
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

34:26.400 --> 34:28.458
GUNFIRE

34:29.824 --> 34:31.976
Georgie, get down!

34:32.533 --> 34:34.630
- Get to cover.
- Take cover!

34:34.652 --> 34:36.744
Get to cover! Get to... Argh!

34:38.259 --> 34:40.094
- GUNFIRE CONTINUES
- Sh... Georgie!

34:40.096 --> 34:42.521
- Man down!
- Man down!

35:01.114 --> 35:02.276
Shit!

35:02.396 --> 35:03.733
Georgie!

35:07.379 --> 35:10.692
Elvis! What are you doing? Take cover!

35:10.897 --> 35:13.201
- ELVIS!
- Argh!

35:21.319 --> 35:24.194
- Elvis!
- Target's down.

35:24.249 --> 35:27.878
Brains! Fingers, shout for medevac now!

35:29.210 --> 35:31.247
How is it? How is it?

35:31.269 --> 35:33.267
OK, I need you to keep
really still for me, OK?

35:33.776 --> 35:34.825
OK.

35:35.169 --> 35:37.133
King, I need a spinal
board and neck braces.

35:37.161 --> 35:39.430
- Is anyone shot?
- Yeah, one of the Paras

35:39.452 --> 35:41.517
took an entry and exit
gunshot wound to the thigh,

35:41.544 --> 35:43.731
through and through. But don't
worry about it, the guys are on it.

35:45.567 --> 35:47.310
- No. No. No. Leave him.
- Oi!

35:47.321 --> 35:48.646
- We must take him away and arrest him.
- No, no, no.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.635
At the moment he's in my charge

35:49.652 --> 35:51.089
and you're not taking him
anywhere, do you understand?

35:51.095 --> 35:52.942
- Kingy, please.
- Look, you heard the medic.

35:52.964 --> 35:55.211
- Not now you don't.
- Reckon I'll be all right?

35:55.916 --> 35:58.540
You weren't all right before
you fell so that's unlikely.

35:59.422 --> 36:01.198
Just keep really still for me, OK?

36:01.226 --> 36:02.924
I weren't going to let
him shoot you, Georgie.

36:04.572 --> 36:06.437
He's got a pulse and his airway's clear.

36:07.247 --> 36:09.306
- Kingy, just take over for me, OK?
- Yeah.

36:09.350 --> 36:11.114
Keep his... keep his head still.

36:11.158 --> 36:12.290
Sure.

36:12.346 --> 36:13.139
- There you go.
- Got him.

36:13.156 --> 36:14.920
OK. OK.

36:15.198 --> 36:17.268
Suspected spinal

36:17.651 --> 36:19.515
- and internal injuries.
- Yeah.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.707
We've got a compound fracture
to the left tib and fib.

36:21.718 --> 36:23.405
- Yeah.
- He's stable at the moment

36:23.433 --> 36:25.237
but we need to make him a priority.

36:25.269 --> 36:27.234
- Give me a collar.
- Boss, we need the medevac now.

36:27.261 --> 36:28.665
- Fingers is already on it.
- OK.

36:28.676 --> 36:29.786
How's Elvis?

36:30.213 --> 36:32.605
He fell on top of this guy.
This guy landed on the rocks.

36:34.697 --> 36:35.896
BRACE!

36:35.951 --> 36:37.122
NOW!

36:37.178 --> 36:38.254
ASAP!

36:39.425 --> 36:40.740
Come on!

36:44.096 --> 36:45.667
Are you sure Elvis is all
right to travel by road?

36:45.689 --> 36:46.882
Yeah, I'll go with him.

36:47.096 --> 36:48.614
To drop him off at the hospital.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.077
For crying out loud, I'm
fine. It's just a rib injury.

36:51.096 --> 36:52.920
Yeah, and potential punctured lung.

36:53.691 --> 36:56.916
Other than that, he'll
live on to twat another day.

36:57.393 --> 36:58.957
Let's get him on. We ready?

37:02.096 --> 37:03.353
Georgie.

37:15.096 --> 37:17.096
SIREN BLARES

37:20.717 --> 37:23.431
Well, he's a very lucky man.

37:24.096 --> 37:27.095
- Is he?
- A fall like that could have killed you.

37:27.096 --> 37:28.793
Well, here I am, alive and kicking.

37:28.843 --> 37:30.435
Only you could have
took a fall like that

37:30.446 --> 37:32.483
and ended up with sore ribs and bruises.

37:33.698 --> 37:35.357
X-rays show no fractures then?

37:35.623 --> 37:37.405
Hairline fracture to seventh rib.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.458
We can give you some pain relief.

37:39.578 --> 37:40.578
Other than

37:40.756 --> 37:42.232
that, rest up, young man.

37:45.518 --> 37:47.515
You so nearly died, Elvis.

37:49.553 --> 37:50.735
Thank you.

37:52.399 --> 37:53.581
What for?

37:54.603 --> 37:56.523
Being concerned.

38:00.890 --> 38:02.271
How is he, Doc?

38:02.715 --> 38:04.519
It will be very painful for a few weeks.

38:04.696 --> 38:05.867
Good.

38:06.344 --> 38:07.637
Pardon?

38:07.698 --> 38:10.006
That's what comes of being
a mad bastard, eh, Elvis?

38:11.272 --> 38:13.096
Just trying to save a life, Captain.

38:28.258 --> 38:30.061
As there's nothing
wrong with you, Elvis,

38:30.078 --> 38:32.087
- you can get your own pudding.
- Yeah, right, you can jog on, mate.

38:32.096 --> 38:33.479
I'm in a bad way, I've got bruised ribs.

38:33.507 --> 38:34.778
Ask the medic, she'll tell you.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.420
You made that poor kid break your fall.

38:37.442 --> 38:38.907
To stop him shooting at you!

38:39.096 --> 38:41.415
Bit of appreciation wouldn't
go amiss, would it? Jesus!

38:42.359 --> 38:44.367
Right, guys, I'd like us
to show our appreciation

38:44.395 --> 38:47.874
to our Kenyan hosts for
their magnificent, nay,

38:47.935 --> 38:49.223
veritable feast.

38:49.234 --> 38:51.592
I'd like you to remember
just how tasty this meal was

38:51.593 --> 38:54.701
because tomorrow you'll be back
in Blighty, queuing up at some

38:54.895 --> 38:57.670
miserable godforsaken
chicken joint waiting

38:57.681 --> 39:00.084
for a takeaway in the rain. So,

39:00.506 --> 39:03.163
- to our chefs!
- THEY CLAP

39:06.377 --> 39:07.436
Elvis,

39:07.736 --> 39:09.439
seeing as you're guest of honour, and

39:09.484 --> 39:11.288
to celebrate the fact
you're actually still alive,

39:11.316 --> 39:13.136
you get to pick our first song.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.455
- Oh, pressure now!
- Please,

39:15.472 --> 39:16.382
if you get him to play Oasis

39:16.421 --> 39:18.058
I will chuck you off that cliff myself!

39:18.096 --> 39:19.799
Not leaving me much
choice there, Charlie.

39:20.193 --> 39:23.026
- What's it going to be?
- Oh, go for, erm...

DISTANT MUSIC AND LAUGHTER

42:28.631 --> 42:30.876
Don't turn around. Just listen.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.479
I loved you from the very
first moment I saw you

42:37.502 --> 42:39.200
and I'll love you till my very last.

42:43.234 --> 42:45.787
I wanted to marry you. I
did. I wanted to turn up.

42:47.434 --> 42:49.182
But on the morning of our wedding...

42:52.096 --> 42:54.094
... suddenly this little
girl walks into my life.

42:54.096 --> 42:55.951
This little girl I
didn't even know existed.

43:00.785 --> 43:03.276
Debbie and I had been out a
few times, which was fine...

43:07.096 --> 43:08.935
Then I went on tour and met you

43:09.574 --> 43:12.096
and I texted her and told
her that her and I were over.

43:13.970 --> 43:15.975
And I promise you, the
first time I knew anything

43:15.976 --> 43:18.578
about the baby was a knock at
the door before our wedding.

43:20.451 --> 43:22.368
I felt like that one
moment my entire life

43:22.373 --> 43:23.909
had just flipped upside down.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.713
All I wanted to do was run to you.

43:29.630 --> 43:31.891
And there I am with this baby in my arms

43:31.913 --> 43:33.772
and I felt like I had
to step up to the plate

43:33.892 --> 43:35.384
and take responsibility.

43:37.004 --> 43:38.127
And shit on me?

43:38.433 --> 43:40.626
I was shitting on myself too, George.

43:42.012 --> 43:43.943
I had to sacrifice you, didn't I?

43:45.461 --> 43:46.942
I sacrificed the one thing

43:46.943 --> 43:48.750
I wanted more than
anything in this world.

43:49.646 --> 43:52.403
Throwing you away to give
this baby some sort of a life.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.121
I thought I was doing my duty.

43:56.833 --> 43:57.823
I was in agony, George.

43:57.824 --> 43:59.381
And I've been in agony ever since.

44:03.096 --> 44:04.924
Why didn't she tell
you she was pregnant?

44:06.776 --> 44:08.214
Because she knew I loved you.

44:10.630 --> 44:12.507
And you texted her
and told her, did you?

44:13.484 --> 44:14.523
Yes.

44:16.854 --> 44:18.972
I'm so much happier without you, Elvis.

44:21.582 --> 44:23.331
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you...

44:25.094 --> 44:27.460
... and your new
boyfriend, your new life.

44:30.404 --> 44:32.770
I just needed you to know
that I never meant to hurt you.

44:34.488 --> 44:35.895
Let you down.

44:37.933 --> 44:39.309
Are you and Debbie together?

44:39.660 --> 44:40.583
No.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.645
I have Laura whenever I can.

44:46.404 --> 44:47.727
She's my life now.

44:50.683 --> 44:52.006
I wanted to tell you, Georgie.

44:52.007 --> 44:54.284
I did, I tried to tell you.
I just didn't know what to do.

44:54.319 --> 44:55.478
- I was...
- Weak.

44:56.743 --> 44:57.813
Was weak.

44:58.096 --> 44:59.668
I was going to say lost.

45:02.212 --> 45:03.149
I just...

45:05.954 --> 45:08.298
I just wish that I
could stop loving you.

45:44.741 --> 45:46.206
You need to sit up,

45:46.246 --> 45:47.866
take the pressure off your chest.

45:49.098 --> 45:50.685
Come on.

47:30.230 --> 47:31.129
Careful.

47:31.151 --> 47:32.965
- You done there, Marie?
- Nearly.

47:33.432 --> 47:35.696
Oh, it looks brilliant.

47:36.179 --> 47:37.300
Where's Jamie?

47:37.344 --> 47:39.042
Oh, he's inside, I think.

47:39.081 --> 47:40.513
- Is that high enough?
- Jamie, come on.

47:40.552 --> 47:42.358
- Let me see.
- Is it tight enough?

47:42.478 --> 47:45.292
Yeah, that looks fine. Just
tie it in a double knot.

47:45.638 --> 47:46.752
Have you finished?

47:46.872 --> 47:48.612
- Yeah.
- Let's have a look.

47:53.164 --> 47:54.020
Perfect.

47:55.027 --> 47:56.071
If a tad American.

47:56.378 --> 47:58.629
Oi! Don't be so cheeky, you!

47:58.677 --> 48:00.457
I'm joking, it's great. I love it.

48:14.095 --> 48:15.693
You looking forward to
being at home, Kingy?

48:15.732 --> 48:19.028
Yeah, there's a couple of people
in need of a good visit. Yeah.

48:23.506 --> 48:26.220
- Yeah. Long time, boys.
- Long time.

48:27.213 --> 48:29.688
Right, square these away
and get them on the bus.

48:29.808 --> 48:32.096
Right, guys. Grab
your bags and let's go.

48:32.424 --> 48:34.394
Don't think you're always getting
a car back to Manchester, Lane!

48:34.810 --> 48:36.219
Boss.

48:36.697 --> 48:38.444
Your humanitarian tour.

48:39.096 --> 48:41.302
- Something to tell the grandkids...
- Oh, yes.

48:46.919 --> 48:48.273
You OK?

48:49.011 --> 48:51.197
Yeah, I'm just a bit
knackered that's all.

48:51.317 --> 48:53.096
We're off to Syria in five weeks' time.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.259
I'd like you with us as our medic.

48:55.379 --> 48:57.068
Does that give you enough
time to sort yourself out?

48:57.423 --> 48:59.193
Boss, man. Sorry.

48:59.209 --> 49:00.791
Don't want to like push it or anything,

49:00.813 --> 49:03.588
but to save me heading back to the
barracks and farting about for a day,

49:03.848 --> 49:06.224
why don't I escort
Lane back to Manchester?

49:06.344 --> 49:08.610
Because, Fingers, you're not
on leave for another 24 hours.

49:08.649 --> 49:10.291
Well, I will kind of be on duty,

49:10.607 --> 49:11.745
be looking after Lane

49:11.756 --> 49:13.243
- and she's dead vulnerable, aren't you?
- Oh, yeah.

49:13.953 --> 49:16.045
- Very.
- Look, fall in line and leave her alone.

49:16.096 --> 49:18.096
No, to be fair, I don't...
Honestly, I don't mind.

49:18.115 --> 49:20.068
- It's nice to have a bit of company.
- Get in!

49:21.096 --> 49:22.015
Are you mad?

49:22.054 --> 49:23.974
- I'll meet you out front.
- All right, see you.

49:29.385 --> 49:30.922
Take care of yourself, Lane.

49:31.743 --> 49:33.480
Give me a ring in a
couple of days' time.

49:33.652 --> 49:35.805
In fact, you can ring me
any time you like. 24/7.

49:36.177 --> 49:37.764
You know that, don't you?

49:37.770 --> 49:39.163
Yeah, thanks, boss.

49:39.169 --> 49:40.489
You'll be all right.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.632
- What did she say?
- Just going past the shops, she said.

49:56.459 --> 49:59.129
- Is that her?
- We don't know what car she's in, do we?

50:01.171 --> 50:02.514
I think it is.

50:03.446 --> 50:04.778
It is!

50:12.452 --> 50:13.811
Come on. Family hug, eh?

50:13.931 --> 50:16.020
- Oh!
- Oh!

50:16.342 --> 50:17.979
Welcome home, kid.

50:18.323 --> 50:20.121
Where have you been?

50:20.653 --> 50:22.124
Hiya.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.443
I'll give you a hand with that.

50:38.521 --> 50:40.096
I missed you.

50:49.776 --> 50:51.884
- You still here, Fingers?
- I know when I'm not wanted.

50:52.117 --> 50:54.425
Sorry. Erm, Jamie, this is Fingers.

50:54.453 --> 50:56.368
- He's a fellow Manc from the platoon.
- How you doing, mate?

50:56.488 --> 50:57.650
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

50:57.673 --> 50:59.337
Erm, cup of tea first?

50:59.792 --> 51:01.679
Yeah, yeah. I won't
say no to a brew, me.

51:01.729 --> 51:04.064
- All right. Mum, is the kettle on?
- Course it is.

51:04.092 --> 51:05.357
Come on then, love.

51:44.362 --> 51:46.165
- Why ain't you asleep?
- Hm?

51:46.868 --> 51:48.835
No, I'm too happy.

51:50.096 --> 51:51.292
You OK?

51:52.505 --> 51:54.025
Why shouldn't I be?

51:55.738 --> 51:58.096
It must take some adjusting.

51:59.310 --> 52:01.522
Even for a colossus like you.

52:02.507 --> 52:04.311
You calling me fat?

52:05.096 --> 52:07.096
- Strong.
- Fuck off!

52:11.420 --> 52:13.210
You're safe now.

52:15.235 --> 52:16.650
Am I?

52:18.114 --> 52:19.598
Of course.

52:21.096 --> 52:23.096
You don't think you are?

52:26.862 --> 52:28.686
Ignore me.

52:34.270 --> 52:35.984
I didn't mean to...

52:36.483 --> 52:38.800
I didn't mean to rush tonight.

52:41.096 --> 52:42.815
Why would you say that?

52:46.421 --> 52:48.586
I just, I just want you with me.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.393
I am with you.

52:52.475 --> 52:54.390
I know it's going to take some time.

53:20.096 --> 53:21.659
That's that one done.

53:21.853 --> 53:24.378
So it was the Addis
Ababa flight, was it, sir?

53:24.399 --> 53:25.856
Yes.

53:26.674 --> 53:28.186
Business or pleasure?

53:28.221 --> 53:30.218
I've been working for a charity.

53:30.571 --> 53:33.596
- Visiting some outreach projects.
- Very nice.

53:34.352 --> 53:35.857
Thank you, sir.

53:58.212 --> 54:00.096
Ah, yeah.

54:01.671 --> 54:04.443
- So good.
- You fill your boots, love.

54:04.471 --> 54:06.337
We could come here for
the wedding breakfast.

54:06.457 --> 54:08.737
Oh, God. Don't give your dad any ideas.

54:08.857 --> 54:10.610
I shouldn't even be eating this.

54:10.623 --> 54:11.738
I'm going to be so bloated!

54:11.766 --> 54:13.086
And I intend to pull at your wedding.

54:13.097 --> 54:15.189
Oh, don't worry. Men
aren't fussy at weddings.

54:15.211 --> 54:16.399
Oh, bloody charming(!)

54:16.610 --> 54:19.507
- THEY LAUGH
- No. I didn't mean that!

54:19.684 --> 54:22.175
I just meant, you know,
with a free bar and that...

54:22.197 --> 54:25.096
Mum, when you're in
a hole, stop digging.

54:25.298 --> 54:26.999
Hold on, there's going to be a free bar?

54:27.002 --> 54:28.883
- That doesn't sound very Dad!
- No,

54:28.911 --> 54:30.304
because my Jamie's paying, that's why.

54:35.719 --> 54:37.567
Right. See you back at base camp, yeah?

54:37.606 --> 54:39.820
- Yeah, give Jamie our love.
- Will do.

54:39.992 --> 54:41.518
You not staying at his tonight?

54:41.729 --> 54:43.649
- Probably.
- Dirty mare.

54:43.677 --> 54:44.643
Oi.

54:44.763 --> 54:46.047
- Bye, Mama.
- Shotgun.

54:46.069 --> 54:48.477
- Bye, Baba. Love you.
- Love you.

54:48.522 --> 54:50.342
- See you later.
- See you!

55:09.096 --> 55:12.004
PHONE RINGS

55:18.096 --> 55:20.021
Elvis, you can't...

55:31.070 --> 55:33.096
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:35.364 --> 55:37.493
- Everything all right?
- Yes, massively!

55:37.542 --> 55:39.470
Just had a big fry-up
with the family so

55:39.484 --> 55:41.614
all is well in the world.

56:05.096 --> 56:06.530
SHE GASPS

56:06.650 --> 56:08.901
Georgie shouldn't be
contemplating going on tour.

56:08.917 --> 56:11.321
- She needs complete rest.
- I'm seeing people

56:11.559 --> 56:12.969
that aren't there.

56:13.208 --> 56:16.399
Raynott re-entered the
country on August 28th.

56:16.438 --> 56:18.735
Do they think he's planning
something on home soil?

56:18.941 --> 56:21.338
Did anything happen between
you and Elvis out there?

56:21.626 --> 56:24.584
- Jamie, no.
- I do love you, you know.

56:24.704 --> 56:27.908
Terror threat is now
escalated to critical.

56:28.096 --> 56:29.966
Attack expected imminently.
