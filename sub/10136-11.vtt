14:34.957 --> 14:36.209
- That's right.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.044
We go down,

14:36.250 --> 14:38.044
we go down, rockin', buddy.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.337
- Shakabraza.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.463
Give me five, alright.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.256
I'm John Travolta.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.256
I'm stayin' alive.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.758
Don't start.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.972
Jess? Jess, look.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.016
Look.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.016
Talking to Artie.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.810
It's gotta be the axe.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.937
(Joey)

14:53.852 --> 14:56.937
'I'll bet she's giving

14:53.852 --> 14:56.937
out pink slips.'

14:56.979 --> 14:59.691
Poor Artie, that guy's

14:56.979 --> 14:59.691
been here 31 years

14:59.733 --> 15:01.984
and they throw him out like

14:59.733 --> 15:01.984
a pair of old disco boots.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.823
'Boy, she is cruel.'

15:06.865 --> 15:08.491
She is heartless.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.034
She is cold.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.412
And really cute.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.499
- Hi. I'm Alison Axelrod.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.499
- Hi.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.667
- Joey Gladstone.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.667
- Hi.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.794
- Hi.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.794
- And you must be Jesse.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.003
Yeah, I must be.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.047
I have decided

15:21.045 --> 15:23.047
to make a few changes.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.716
And these are for you.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.095
Jesse, and Joey.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.764
Let me tell you something.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.932
I grew up on this

15:30.805 --> 15:32.932
station, KFLH, okay.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.309
You were playing The Beach Boys,

15:32.973 --> 15:35.309
The Beatles, The Who.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.437
That's why I learned about

15:35.351 --> 15:37.437
rock 'n' roll right here

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
If you're gonna ruin

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
the best station in this town

15:39.105 --> 15:41.023
it's fine with me

15:39.105 --> 15:41.023
but you can do it without us.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.692
Because, we quit.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.692
Let's go, Joseph.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.364
Joey, what

15:45.779 --> 15:48.364
are you doing?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.990
Flight of the bumblebee

15:50.032 --> 15:51.534
by Rimsky-Korsakov.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.746
[imitating flight

15:51.576 --> 15:54.746
of the bumblebee]

15:55.455 --> 15:57.624
Traitor.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
If he's gonna quit,

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
I'm gonna need

15:59.125 --> 16:00.585
that parking pass back.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.880
Parking pass?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.214
Yeah, I thought

16:03.922 --> 16:05.214
we'd go on

16:05.256 --> 16:07.425
an assigned

16:05.256 --> 16:07.425
parking system.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.510
You know, I-I just

16:07.467 --> 16:09.510
was afraid that

16:09.552 --> 16:11.053
if everybody came in

16:09.552 --> 16:11.053
all at once

16:11.095 --> 16:12.764
then they'd all get

16:11.095 --> 16:12.764
jumbled up.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.515
And you know,

16:12.806 --> 16:14.515
it's my first day

16:14.557 --> 16:16.309
and I'm just

16:14.557 --> 16:16.309
trying to be nice.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.436
That's okay.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.436
It's-It's okay.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.147
You know what,

16:18.478 --> 16:21.147
uh, eh, excuse me.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.774
I've got to head someone off

16:21.188 --> 16:22.774
at the elevator.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.444
I'll be, I'll-I'll give you

16:22.816 --> 16:26.444
another hug when I--.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.904
Hold on.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.904
Jess.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.387
F-13.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.387
What a great spot.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.848
Thanks.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.848
It's-it's a great spot.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.349
I gotta perfect view

16:54.889 --> 16:56.349
of the car in front of me.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.809
Thank you.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.060
Did you guys think

16:57.851 --> 17:00.060
I was gonna fire you?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.480
- No. Absolutely, no.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.480
- No. No.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.649
It's just that..

17:02.522 --> 17:04.649
Not that we believed it.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.442
But we heard this

17:04.691 --> 17:06.442
vicious, silly rumor

17:06.484 --> 17:08.110
that you know

17:06.484 --> 17:08.110
you gonna fire everybody

17:08.152 --> 17:09.320
and switch to classical.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.531
[scoffs]

17:09.362 --> 17:11.531
Why would I do that?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.491
I don't know, I mean,

17:11.572 --> 17:13.491
just we heard you had this

17:13.533 --> 17:16.202
this moniker you know,

17:13.533 --> 17:16.202
"The-the Axe."

17:16.243 --> 17:18.579
The axe.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.579
I hate that name.

17:18.621 --> 17:20.581
I don't know

17:18.621 --> 17:20.581
how it got started.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.458
Let me just give you

17:20.623 --> 17:22.458
a little piece of advice I mean

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
if you gonna give out

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
new-new parking spots.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.419
you shouldn't

17:24.210 --> 17:25.419
make 'em pink us.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.921
We thought you

17:25.461 --> 17:26.921
firing Artie.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.381
Oh, I did.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.508
The guy is dead weight.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.551
[blows sharply]

17:31.592 --> 17:32.927
See ya.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.726
- Phew..

17:39.767 --> 17:42.770
[instrumental music]

17:42.812 --> 17:45.023
Here comes dad.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.274
Great.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.274
This is going like clockwork.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.861
Now, just do what I do.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.861
Look casual.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.533
[door opens]

17:55.575 --> 17:57.952
Hey, girls,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.952
what are you up to?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.412
Nothing.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.455
Nothing.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.665
How about you?

18:02.707 --> 18:04.417
How about you?

18:04.458 --> 18:07.003
Well, I signed up

18:04.458 --> 18:07.003
for scuba lessons.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.421
Got my wet suit,

18:07.045 --> 18:08.421
right here.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.130
Well, I can't wait

18:08.462 --> 18:10.130
to be underwater

18:10.172 --> 18:11.507
not thinking about Vicky.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.386
I gotta go find

18:13.300 --> 18:15.386
a cold ocean.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.971
See you later, dad.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.514
See you later, dad.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.684
Hey, guys,

18:20.140 --> 18:21.684
how's dad doing?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.644
He's gonna be

18:21.726 --> 18:23.644
doing great.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.855
We're getting him

18:23.686 --> 18:25.855
and Vicky back together.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.231
We got a plan.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.526
You two came up

18:28.691 --> 18:30.526
with a plan?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.486
You can't even

18:30.568 --> 18:32.486
match your socks.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.989
For your information

18:35.031 --> 18:36.657
it's an

18:35.031 --> 18:36.657
extremely sophisticated

18:36.699 --> 18:39.326
and intelligent plan.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.704
Yeah, we called Vicky

18:39.368 --> 18:41.704
and we told her

18:41.746 --> 18:43.998
that I got my head

18:41.746 --> 18:43.998
stuck in a fence.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.293
That's insane.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.293
No one's gonna believe that.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.378
[siren wailing]

18:50.421 --> 18:52.840
Wow.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.840
That sounds close.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.259
(Vicky)

18:52.882 --> 18:55.259
'Open up, girls.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.259
I've got the fire department.'

18:58.345 --> 18:59.847
The fire department is here?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.307
They don't see a girl

18:59.889 --> 19:01.307
stuck in the fence

19:01.348 --> 19:02.850
we're gonna look like idiots.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.644
Oh, you're way past that.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.603
[knock on door]

19:05.645 --> 19:07.187
- 'Girls?'

19:05.645 --> 19:07.187
- Stall 'em.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.356
Okay, come on, backyard.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.275
Can we talk about this?

19:14.528 --> 19:15.613
Quick.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.613
Stick your head in.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.364
Yeah, right.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.200
Just do it.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.369
You are so bossy.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.797
Hey, twerp,

19:30.544 --> 19:32.797
this is private property.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.716
Shh, I'm in the middle

19:32.839 --> 19:35.716
of a plan.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.344
Well, as long as

19:37.259 --> 19:38.344
you're here

19:38.385 --> 19:40.387
do you like

19:38.385 --> 19:40.387
grilled sardines?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.723
Ew.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.934
Are you sure you wouldn't

19:42.765 --> 19:44.934
like a nice bran muffin?

19:44.976 --> 19:46.144
Oh, there she is.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.354
Oh, Michelle,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.354
are you okay?

19:48.395 --> 19:51.565
Kids, they'll stick their heads

19:48.395 --> 19:51.565
in the darndest places.

19:53.442 --> 19:57.196
Hey, what is going on

19:53.442 --> 19:57.196
out here?

19:57.237 --> 19:58.865
You tell us, aquaman.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.909
Michelle is stuck

19:59.949 --> 20:01.909
in the fence.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.327
What?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.245
Alright, everybody stand back.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.083
Come on, Gus,

20:06.622 --> 20:09.083
let's chop her out.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.459
"Chop?"

20:11.377 --> 20:13.880
The plan is over.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.050
Yeah, that "Chop" thing

20:13.921 --> 20:17.050
works every time.

20:17.091 --> 20:19.177
I am so sorry, the girls

20:17.091 --> 20:19.177
called and said that

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Michelle's head

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
was stuck in the fence .

20:20.260 --> 20:21.846
I thought it was an emergency.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.347
Yeah, I'm sorry

20:21.888 --> 20:23.347
too, gentlemen.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.725
I have no idea why my daughters

20:23.389 --> 20:25.725
are acting so weird.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.020
I could take a guess.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.817
Thanks, guys.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.695
Hey, girls, you know

20:34.859 --> 20:37.695
better than to say

20:37.737 --> 20:39.572
something's an emergency

20:37.737 --> 20:39.572
unless it really is.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.490
I'm sorry.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.659
We made up that story

20:41.532 --> 20:43.659
to get Vicky to come over

20:43.701 --> 20:44.869
so you two would make up.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.582
Next time

20:47.788 --> 20:49.582
you have a plan

20:49.623 --> 20:51.500
use your own head.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.136
Vicky,

20:59.967 --> 21:02.136
I-I'm sorry about this.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.722
Thanks for being

21:02.178 --> 21:04.722
so concerned about Michelle.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.932
No problem.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.102
Vicky, listen, um..

21:11.437 --> 21:13.731
Since we broke up,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.731
I, uh..

21:13.773 --> 21:16.067
I really haven't

21:13.773 --> 21:16.067
been myself.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.194
Well, you're certainly

21:16.109 --> 21:18.194
dressing differently.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.156
Well, I started taking up

21:19.570 --> 21:22.156
scuba diving

21:22.198 --> 21:26.786
to try to keep my mind off

21:22.198 --> 21:26.786
how much I missed you.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.621
Did it work?

21:28.662 --> 21:30.915
No, but the chafing

21:28.662 --> 21:30.915
distracted me for a while.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.251
[chuckles]

21:33.292 --> 21:36.003
I'm sorry, I'm sure your mother

21:33.292 --> 21:36.003
had great intentions but..

21:36.045 --> 21:37.838
But I'm not ready

21:36.045 --> 21:37.838
for that kind of change.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.175
If it bothers you so much,

21:37.880 --> 21:41.175
go back to the old wallpaper.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.343
No, no,

21:42.176 --> 21:43.343
it's not the girls room.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.013
I'm-I'm talking

21:43.385 --> 21:46.013
about marriage.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.723
Marriage? Who's talking

21:46.055 --> 21:47.723
about marriage?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.892
Your mother.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.228
I'll kill her.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.396
Danny, just because my mother

21:52.270 --> 21:54.396
brought up marriage

21:54.438 --> 21:57.441
it doesn't mean that

21:54.438 --> 21:57.441
I'm ready to talk about it.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.818
Well, then everything's settled.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.989
Everything's not settled.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.408
Why didn't you tell me

22:03.030 --> 22:06.408
what was really bothering you?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.995
Oh, I don't know,

22:06.450 --> 22:08.995
everything was changing so fast

22:09.036 --> 22:11.497
that I just I didn't know

22:09.036 --> 22:11.497
how to deal with it.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.834
Well, change doesn't have

22:11.538 --> 22:14.834
to be a bad thing.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.336
Change is really

22:14.875 --> 22:17.336
difficult for me, Vicky.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.006
I've been using the same

22:17.377 --> 22:20.006
oven mitt for 12 years.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.302
I was thinking more

22:21.423 --> 22:24.302
about our relationship.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.637
It won't grow

22:24.343 --> 22:26.637
without change.

22:28.430 --> 22:32.185
Well, I can

22:28.430 --> 22:32.185
deal with change

22:32.226 --> 22:34.645
if, uh, if we can

22:32.226 --> 22:34.645
do it together.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.233
I love you, Vicky.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.944
I love you, too.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.112
Oh, I missed you.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.905
I missed you, too.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.240
You know what?

22:46.282 --> 22:47.574
I gotta get

22:46.282 --> 22:47.574
out of this suit.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.828
- It's really starting to bunch.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.828
- Sure.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.913
Oh, uh, sweetheart?

22:52.955 --> 22:54.123
Yes.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.708
You're standing

22:54.165 --> 22:55.708
on my flipper.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.835
- Oh.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.835
- Thank you.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.419
Help me out of this,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.419
please?
