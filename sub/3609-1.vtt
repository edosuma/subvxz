00:02.003 --> 00:03.368
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.462 --> 00:07.330
This is not your island.
This is our island.

00:07.425 --> 00:12.169
[Locke] They’ve attacked us, sabotaged
us, abducted us, murdered us.

00:12.263 --> 00:16.131
We’re not the only people
on this island, and we all know it.

00:16.225 --> 00:19.012
[Ana Lucia] They came the ﬁrst night,
took three of us.

00:19.103 --> 00:22.436
Then they came back
and took nine more.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.356
They're smart and they're animals.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.650
You're coming with us.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.365
[birds chirping]

00:43.878 --> 00:47.245
[J‘ Petula Clark: Downtown]

01:13.658 --> 01:15.865
[alarm beeping]

01:28.339 --> 01:30.421
[doorbell ringing]

01:35.972 --> 01:39.556
l burnt my hand. And my muffins.

01:39.642 --> 01:41.678
[tools clanking]

01:41.769 --> 01:45.978
- Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
- [Ethan] It's a work in progress.

01:47.525 --> 01:50.141
It's not even literature.
It's popcorn.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.852
Why isn't it literature, Adam?
I'm dying to know.

01:52.947 --> 01:57.361
There's no metaphor. It's religious
hokum-pokum. It's science fiction.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.238
- Now I know why Ben isn't here.
- Excuse me?

02:00.329 --> 02:02.615
I know the host
picks the book, but, Julie,

02:02.707 --> 02:05.119
he wouldn't read this
in the damned bathroom.

02:05.209 --> 02:10.294
Well, Adam, I am the host,
and I do pick the book.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.088
And this is my favorite book,

02:13.175 --> 02:18.044
so I am absolutely thrilled
that you can't stand it.

02:18.139 --> 02:22.257
Silly me for sinking so low as to select
something that Ben wouldn't like.

02:22.351 --> 02:26.515
Here I am thinking that freewill
still actually exists on...

02:26.605 --> 02:28.311
[rumbling]

02:28.399 --> 02:31.266
- [Adam] Whoa.
- The doorway. Get under the doorway.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.695
[indistinct screaming]

03:06.854 --> 03:10.392
[object whizzing]

03:25.790 --> 03:26.825
Goodwin.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.535
- You see where the tail landed?
- Probably in the water.

03:32.630 --> 03:36.043
You can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up to that fuselage.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.670
There may actually be survivors.

03:38.761 --> 03:41.594
And you're one of 'em.
A passenger. You're in shock.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.717
Come up with a story if they ask.
Stay quiet if they don't.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.970
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.347
I want lists in three days. Go.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.026
So, I guess I'm out of the book club.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.481
[music plays on radio]

04:54.503 --> 04:56.880

06:44.154 --> 06:45.735
[muffled] Hey!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.575
Kate!

06:49.618 --> 06:52.109
Can you hear me?

06:53.622 --> 06:55.829
Kate!

06:58.669 --> 07:00.830
[water running]

07:06.885 --> 07:09.843
Rise and shine, Kate.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.341
Where am I?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.269
You don't really think
I'm going to answer that, do you?

07:19.857 --> 07:23.315
- Where are Sawyer and Jack?
- I'll tell you what.

07:23.402 --> 07:27.441
Why don't you just take a nice
hot shower, wake yourself up,

07:27.531 --> 07:30.273
wash the day off you and start fresh?

07:30.367 --> 07:33.109
Here's a nice clean towel,
shampoo, soap...

07:33.203 --> 07:35.535
I'm not showering in front of you.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.582
[laughing] Kate, you're not my type.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.087
[door slams]

[groaning]

08:32.596 --> 08:33.756
[whispering] Hey.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.927
Where are we?

08:42.564 --> 08:45.226
Who the hell are you?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.977
You ain't gonna talk to me?

08:50.948 --> 08:54.736
What, you got
more important things to do?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.728
[female] Warning.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.110
- Warning.
- [buzzing]

09:42.082 --> 09:44.073
I wouldn't do that.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.409
If I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.299
Son of a bitch!

09:55.679 --> 09:57.419
Told you.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.694
[shouting]

10:22.915 --> 10:24.405
[woman] Stop that.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.294
Hi, Jack.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.295
I'm Juliet.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.108
Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
I'm here for the...

10:53.195 --> 10:56.107
Where's your lawyer?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.331
You look pretty.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.408
Where's your lawyer?

lfired him.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.961
Sarah...

11:22.099 --> 11:27.184
I'm sorry for pushing us to this place.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.637
- I know that l...
- [phone ringing]

11:33.694 --> 11:35.855
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.354
Yeah?

11:41.076 --> 11:43.692
No, not yet. He just got here.

11:43.787 --> 11:48.201
[chuckles] I'll call you when | get out.

11:55.257 --> 11:58.499
- I'm gonna say this as simply as I can.
- What's his name?

11:58.594 --> 12:00.425
- Stop it.
- I'm not gonna stop it.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.844
I'm gonna keep asking you
until you tell me.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.139
- I don't ask you what you do...
- Just tell me what his name is.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.218
I wanna know who he is.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.806
Look, you can have everything,
the cars, the house, I don't care.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.735
| just... I just wanna know

12:17.821 --> 12:23.236
the name of the man
that is with my wife.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.586
[chains rattling]

12:43.680 --> 12:45.932
Jack?

12:47.309 --> 12:50.472
Can you hear me in there?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.690
- Is that a yes?
- Where are my friends?

12:56.777 --> 12:58.313
Come down from the table first.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.270
You want me to come down,
come in here and get me down.

13:01.365 --> 13:05.574
- If you wanna talk, I'm happy to.
- Tell me where my friends are!

13:06.495 --> 13:09.202
lwill if you let go of the chain.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.995
Do you think I'm stupid?

13:15.963 --> 13:19.876
I don't think you're stupid, Jack.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.925
I think you're stubborn.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.407
Hey!

13:55.252 --> 13:57.709
Where are my clothes?

14:21.653 --> 14:23.154
[whistles]

14:26.783 --> 14:30.241
Come on, Kate. He's waiting.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.274
Sorry. I'm going to have to ask you
to put those on, Kate.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.568
And if I don't?

15:47.697 --> 15:50.029
Then you don't get any coffee.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.830
A little tighter.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.264
What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?

16:23.358 --> 16:25.394
Now, why Sawyer?

16:26.278 --> 16:29.816
- Why Sawyer what?
- He's the first one you asked about.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.023
"What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"

16:35.579 --> 16:38.571
- You don't know me.
- Of course I don't.

16:41.209 --> 16:45.122
- I want my clothes back.
- We burned them.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.130
Why did you bring me here?

16:49.217 --> 16:52.129
Why did you make me put on this dress?

16:52.220 --> 16:54.211
Why are you feeding me breakfast?

16:57.350 --> 17:00.934
I brought you here so you'd look out
at the water and feel comforted,

17:01.021 --> 17:05.856
comforted that your friends
were looking out at the same ocean.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.184
I gave you the dress
so you'd feel like a lady.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.488
And I wanted you to eat your food
with a real live fork

17:13.575 --> 17:15.907
and feel civilized.

17:18.288 --> 17:23.373
I did all those things so that you'd
have something nice to hold onto.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.870
Because, Kate,

17:27.964 --> 17:32.253
the next two weeks
are going to be very unpleasant.

17:44.356 --> 17:49.521
Yeah, hi. I met a woman
on the train, Sarah,

17:49.611 --> 17:53.695
and she dropped her cell phone
and I don't even know her last name,

17:53.782 --> 17:58.151
but your number was in her phone,
so I was just wondering...

17:58.245 --> 18:00.406
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forget it.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.204
- Hey.
- Just give me a minute, Dad.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.043
| asked you to give me a minute here.

18:08.129 --> 18:13.874
What's this? Why are you dialing
all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?

18:13.969 --> 18:18.588
- Because one of them is him.
- You gotta stop this, Jack. It's over.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.515
Not until I know his name,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.684
where he works, where he lives,
when they first kissed.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.683
I wanna know what it is about him.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.320
Why is Sarah calling you, Dad?

18:40.745 --> 18:43.532
I think it's time that you let this go.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.457
- Why is she calling you?
- Because she was afraid for you.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.786
I wanna know exactly
why the hell she was calling.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.257
You were slipping, losing your grip.

18:53.341 --> 18:58.051
- My grip is not the problem here.
- Which is exactly what's happening.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.971
I think I know something
about being obsessive.

19:01.057 --> 19:06.518
No. Being a drunk is not obsessive.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.282
Let it go, Jack.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.545
[grunting]

19:42.432 --> 19:45.549
[spitting, coughing]

19:49.064 --> 19:51.601
[static, indistinct
voices over intercom]

19:54.986 --> 19:56.977
What?

19:58.782 --> 20:02.445
If you're trying to talk to me,
I can't hear you.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.618
[Christian] Let it go, Jack.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.000
I know you're hungry.
I brought this for you.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.958
This is how it will work.

20:16.049 --> 20:20.463
You sit there, across from the door,
back against the wall.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.045
| open the door and leave the tray.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.301
Can I trust you to do that, Jack?

20:29.312 --> 20:32.349
- I don't want your food.
- It's a delicious sandwich.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.900
Tell the guy who's trying to talk to me
through that intercom he can give it up!

20:38.363 --> 20:42.481
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.281
[panting]

20:44.369 --> 20:47.657
What's that for?
The button, what's it for?

20:48.498 --> 20:52.411
- It's for emergencies.
- Who's watching me?

20:53.795 --> 20:57.083
Are you going to sit against the wall
so I can open the door?

20:57.173 --> 21:00.085
It's just off the frying pan.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.167
You can have it.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.807
What do you do, Jack?
What's your profession?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.434
I'm a repo man.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.858
You know, when people don't pay
their bills, I go in for the bank

21:18.945 --> 21:21.402
and I collect their possessions.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.105
I'm a people person,
so I really love it.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.065
Are you married?

21:26.161 --> 21:30.245
No. I never saw the point.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.617
What about you?

21:32.709 --> 21:36.952
What's your job,
besides making sandwiches?

21:37.046 --> 21:40.834
I didn't make it.
| just put the toothpicks in.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.798
When your plane crashed,
where were you flying from?

21:58.276 --> 21:59.857
Sydney.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.943
What were you doing there?

22:03.031 --> 22:05.317
l was bringing my father home.

22:05.408 --> 22:10.323
- Why go all the way to Australia to...?
- Because he was dead.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.077
- I'm sorry.
- [chuckles]

22:15.168 --> 22:18.706
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.082
Thanks.

22:27.722 --> 22:31.180
You can trust me, Jack.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.930
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:42.779 --> 22:46.397
What the hell is going on here?

23:12.058 --> 23:13.559
[man] Hey!

23:16.229 --> 23:19.392
Hey, how long would it take
to get to your camp?

23:19.482 --> 23:22.224
What, you're talking to me now, Chachi?

23:23.778 --> 23:26.235
From where they got you,
how long a walk was it?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.358
- Day? Two days?
- [groaning]

23:28.449 --> 23:31.236
Hey, what are the people like,
from your plane?

23:31.327 --> 23:33.818
They're just awesome.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.405
Last one of you boys came for a visit
got tortured by our Iraqi.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.991
He tortured me, too. [chuckles]

23:40.086 --> 23:43.453
But, hell, you don't know any better.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.217
- [woman over PA] Subject escape.
- Hey, whoa.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.545
Subject escape. Subject escape.

23:51.639 --> 23:55.223
Hey, how'd you get out of there?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.310
- Run that way.
- Hold on.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.433
You run that way.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.656
- [alarm ringing]
- Hey.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.879
Ah! [groaning]

24:38.269 --> 24:40.681
[door slamming]

24:51.824 --> 24:54.816
Say it. Say it, Karl.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.244
I'm... sorry...

25:01.042 --> 25:05.411
...sorry I involved you
in my breakout attempt.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.108
The drugs we gave you
when we brought you here

25:37.203 --> 25:40.445
have a fairly serious side effect:
dehydration.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.156
Your head is probably sore,
your throat is raw,

25:43.251 --> 25:45.617
and if you don't eat or drink
something soon,

25:45.712 --> 25:47.873
you're going to start hallucinating.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.461
So you're a doctor, huh?

25:54.637 --> 25:58.380
No. I'm a repo woman.

26:02.103 --> 26:05.891
No strings attached.
You don't have to answer any questions.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.847
You don't have to do anything

26:07.942 --> 26:10.558
but sit with your back
up against the far wall,

26:10.653 --> 26:13.611
let me open that door,
put the plate down and leave.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.991
I know it feels like you're giving up,

26:19.078 --> 26:22.912
like you're losing
if you do anything that | ask you to,

26:22.999 --> 26:25.285
but you're not.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.458
You need to eat.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.467
What do you say?

27:02.079 --> 27:04.821
[gasping]

27:08.961 --> 27:10.952
Thank you, Jack.

27:17.804 --> 27:22.173
Let's take out the epidural catheter
and get him started on a PCA.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.474
[Christian] Excuse me forjust a second.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.678
You sure he's ready
to self-administer his pain meds?

27:28.773 --> 27:30.764
Hello?

27:39.909 --> 27:41.900
[woman] Dr. Shephard?

27:44.413 --> 27:46.790
Yeah. Bye.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.704
- Jack?
- Give me your cell phone.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.998
- What? What?
- I wanna see it. Now.

28:31.085 --> 28:35.829
Look where you are, Jack.
Just look around you. Please.

28:36.591 --> 28:38.206
- OK?
- Give me the phone.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.883
This is not the place for this.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.963
You must be Jack.
Why don't you grab a chair, join us?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.480
You... you know me?

28:54.567 --> 28:57.525
Yes. Your father's told us
all about you.

28:57.612 --> 29:01.230
What's he told you about me?
What'd you tell them about me, Dad?

29:01.324 --> 29:05.112
That your son never really had it?
Not like the old man.

29:06.370 --> 29:11.080
I didn't have the will to make it work?
My life? My job?

29:11.167 --> 29:16.002
My marriage? What'd you tell them
about my marriage, Dad?

29:16.756 --> 29:19.293
You know how he manages his marriage?

29:19.383 --> 29:21.920
A bottle of Scotch every night
before dinner.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.878
Your father has been sober 50 days now.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.840
We're very proud of that.

29:30.519 --> 29:36.185
Wow, Dad. I wonder what helped you
turn that corner?

29:37.568 --> 29:41.527
Think maybe it was a new lady friend?
You think maybe that's what it was?

29:41.614 --> 29:45.778
- I will not let you talk to me this...
- I will not let you sleep with my wife.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.696
Oh, Jack. Jack, I'm yourfather.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.282
Jack, please, just let it go.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.596
[both gasping, groaning]

30:19.235 --> 30:21.942
- Which way out?
- Don't do this, Jack.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.270
Don't... Don't...

30:36.752 --> 30:39.004
- No!
- Open the door.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.670
- I can't. I do that, we die.
- You're lying to me.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.463
- I'm not.
- Open the door!

30:43.551 --> 30:47.135
- I can't. I swear I can't.
- She's telling the truth, Jack.

30:50.433 --> 30:54.017
I swear to God, lwill kill her.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.389
OK.

30:59.608 --> 31:04.648
Have her open the door
and she dies anyway. We all do.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.535
No!

31:23.466 --> 31:25.878
[door squealing]

31:40.149 --> 31:42.856
Jack! Over here!

32:05.132 --> 32:07.669
The yellow button! The button!

32:12.681 --> 32:14.421
[grunts]

32:34.703 --> 32:36.614
[grunting] Come here.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.873
[chuckling]

33:06.735 --> 33:08.771
[woman] Warning.

33:10.531 --> 33:14.319
- [up-tempo music plays]
- Whoo! Whoo!

33:14.410 --> 33:16.822
Gotcha, Doc Brown!

33:18.414 --> 33:20.700
Reward. Reward.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.542
Come on.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.004
Unbelievable.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.936
[man] Keep moving.

34:08.756 --> 34:12.169
Stick your hands out through the bars,
I'll take off your cuffs.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.296
Scratched you up pretty bad,
didn't they?

34:15.387 --> 34:20.006
- I'll bring you some antiseptic later.
- How about you bring me an ottoman?

34:20.100 --> 34:22.477
While you're at it,
I could use a blow-dry.

34:22.561 --> 34:27.851
Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit.
How'd you do that?

34:27.942 --> 34:30.979
I figured out your complicated gizmos,
that's how.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.937
Only took the bears two hours.

34:35.491 --> 34:38.198
How many of 'em were there?

34:41.247 --> 34:43.158
You OK, Freckles?

34:47.002 --> 34:49.084
Yeah.

34:49.171 --> 34:52.288
- You?
- Just swell.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.672
I requested that cage, but whatever.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.936
Nice dress.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.639
They made me wear it.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.733
You hungry?

35:50.357 --> 35:52.348
[groaning]

35:57.990 --> 35:59.981
[grunting loudly]

36:09.418 --> 36:12.956
It's an aquarium.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.709
- Excuse me?
- This thing's for what,

36:17.760 --> 36:21.753
- sharks?
- Dolphins, too.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.806
- We're underwater, aren't we?
- Yes.

36:34.818 --> 36:39.938
Is this one of their stations,
the Dharma Initiative?

36:40.032 --> 36:42.023
They called it the Hydra.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.618
So you people are just...

36:48.290 --> 36:50.872
...whatever's left over of them?

36:52.586 --> 36:55.578
Well, that was a long time ago.

36:58.258 --> 37:04.219
It doesn't matter... who we were.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.469
It only matters who we are.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.926
We know exactly who you are,
Jack Shephard.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.100
You don't know anything about me.

37:14.817 --> 37:16.808
I know that you're a spinal surgeon

37:16.902 --> 37:20.315
based out of St. Sebastian's Hospital
in Los Angeles.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.021
I know that you went to Columbia

37:22.116 --> 37:26.234
and you graduated med school
a year faster than anyone else.

37:26.328 --> 37:29.786
I know that you were married, only once,

37:29.873 --> 37:32.285
and that you contested the divorce.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.586
I know your father died in Sydney.

37:37.673 --> 37:43.009
I know this because
I have a copy of his autopsy report.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.839
How...?

37:48.851 --> 37:51.342
- How did you get...?
- We got it.

37:54.857 --> 37:57.348
What is that?

37:58.735 --> 38:03.695
This, Jack, is your life.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.612
Do you...?

38:08.704 --> 38:13.949
ls itjust about me or is it about
my family, too? My... my friends?

38:14.042 --> 38:16.954
It's pretty much about everything.

38:19.214 --> 38:25.130
Do you know about my...
about my ex-wife?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.551
Sarah.

38:28.182 --> 38:33.051
Yes, Jack. We know all about her.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.231
What would you like to find out?

38:44.072 --> 38:45.812
[man] Get ready for the lockdown.

38:45.908 --> 38:49.116
Shephard. Someone posted your bail.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.801
- How'd you...?
- Your clad told me you were here.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.554
I called you a cab.

39:14.645 --> 39:18.638
So, goodbye.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.868
- Sarah.
- What?

39:38.919 --> 39:40.375
Is that him?

39:40.462 --> 39:43.124
- What difference does it make?
- It just does.

39:43.215 --> 39:48.505
I wanna know. I need to know who he is.

39:48.595 --> 39:52.383
It doesn't matter who he is.
It just matters who you're not.

39:57.980 --> 40:03.896
Jack, your father,
when he called me,

40:03.986 --> 40:07.820
to help you,

40:07.906 --> 40:11.490
he was so drunk
I could hardly understand him.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.992
Look at the bright side.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.871
Now you have something to fix.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.765
[Juliet] Jack.

40:41.982 --> 40:46.772
Jack, what would you like to find out?

40:51.867 --> 40:53.858
Is she...?

40:56.038 --> 40:58.199
Is she happy?

41:00.334 --> 41:05.169
Yes, Jack, she's very happy.

41:17.976 --> 41:21.309
Now, I'd like to bring you
some food and water.

41:21.396 --> 41:25.890
But this time I need to know
that you'll behave.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.475
Can I trust you, Jack?

41:35.327 --> 41:39.491
Put your back against the wall, please.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.567
Good work, Juliet.

42:17.160 --> 42:20.152
Thank you, Ben.
