And I wouldn't do anything
to hurt you either, honey.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.646
I love you.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.782
- Would you please
come with me, Mrs. Dao?

19:34.825 --> 19:36.349
- If you don't mind.

19:43.486 --> 19:46.533
Concealing information about
your son is not gonna help him,

19:46.576 --> 19:48.926
especially if you want us
to bring him in alive.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.496
- I understand.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.894
What I'm about to share
with you,

19:59.937 --> 20:04.246
you have to promise me
you'll never tell my wife.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.554
Please.
It'll destroy her if she knew.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.732
- Were you having an affair
with Lauren Williams?

20:11.775 --> 20:14.778
Is that why he went after her
and came here to confront you?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.476
- You mean the poker dealer
you showed me?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.608
That's not it at all.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.742
You both know about
Elkot Thompson, right?

20:21.785 --> 20:25.485
- Yes. Your son was there when
he died in a training accident.

20:25.528 --> 20:29.315
- It was no accident.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.708
Binh killed him.

20:33.928 --> 20:37.323
- Are you saying that the NCIS
investigation was wrong,

20:37.366 --> 20:38.585
or it was a cover-up?

20:38.628 --> 20:40.848
- I'm saying there was
no investigation.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.632
It looked like an accident
from the beginning,

20:42.676 --> 20:45.418
so that's how it went down
in the official record.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.856
When Binh came home,
he told me the truth.

20:48.899 --> 20:52.512
He said it weighed
on his conscience.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.514
- Well, if Binh killed
a fellow officer,

20:54.557 --> 20:57.865
it was your duty
to turn him in.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.694
Once a marine,
always a marine, right?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.913
- "Semper fi" means
"always faithful,"

21:02.957 --> 21:04.611
and I am always faithful--

21:04.654 --> 21:07.962
first to my wife,
and then to my son.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.664
- Did Binh tell you
why he killed Thompson?

21:14.708 --> 21:16.927
- The guy had it coming.

21:16.971 --> 21:20.322
He used to bunk with Binh.
He saw a family photo.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.715
He used to always say,

21:21.758 --> 21:24.848
"Hey, is your mom
a Vietnamese prostitute?"

21:24.892 --> 21:27.895

in the war.

21:27.938 --> 21:31.420
Always making jokes
about my Thuy,

21:31.464 --> 21:33.944
you know, because she married
a guy like me.

21:33.988 --> 21:37.339
And then, one day,
Binh had us on speakerphone,

21:37.383 --> 21:41.343
and you could hear this guy
spouting out his BS.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.911
"Oh, I ruv you rong time."

21:43.954 --> 21:47.741
My poor Thuy
was so embarrassed.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.004
It was disgusting!

21:51.788 --> 21:54.791
I wanted to break his neck.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.924
If the shoe were
on the other foot

21:56.967 --> 21:58.491
and it was me,

21:58.534 --> 21:59.927
I don't know
what I would have done

21:59.970 --> 22:02.364
to shut him the hell up,

22:02.408 --> 22:04.975
so I don't blame my son.

22:05.019 --> 22:09.066
I don't blame him one bit
for losing his cool

22:09.110 --> 22:14.028
on that mouthy, racist SOB.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.335
Not one bit.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.604
- Binh went home armed with a
SIG M18, intending to kill Ken,

22:24.647 --> 22:27.041
but not napalm this time.
- Which tracks.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.912
Igniting napalm indoors...
[cell phone trilling]

22:28.956 --> 22:31.045
Could have killed himself
and his mom.

22:31.088 --> 22:33.439
- So he wanted to go
after his stepdad

22:33.482 --> 22:34.831
without hurting his mother.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.964
- But he backed out,
because he knew killing Ken

22:37.007 --> 22:39.401
was gonna be the thing
that hurt his mother the most.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.361
I mean, I've talked to Thuy.
She's torn up about this.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.624
She loves them both.
- Maybe he didn't.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.626
Maybe Binh didn't like
his mom being with Ken.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.149
Have y'all heard of the MRA?

22:48.192 --> 22:50.499
Stands for Men's Rights Asians.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.588
It's a subreddit group
of Asian men

22:52.632 --> 22:54.851
who feel like they've
been wronged by society.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.331
- Yeah, I read that article.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.899
They're especially pissed
that Asian women are valued

22:58.942 --> 23:00.814
and sexualized in a way
that Asian men aren't.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.468
- Because the stereotype

23:02.511 --> 23:04.121
is that they're nerdy
and emasculated?

23:04.165 --> 23:05.601
- Exactly.
I mean, I've read articles

23:05.645 --> 23:07.777
that show that Asian men
and Black women

23:07.821 --> 23:09.605
have the hardest time
when it comes to online dating.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.739

to read with two kids at home?

23:12.782 --> 23:14.828
- You're up late,
you get bored.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.134
- These guys hate
on interracial relationships

23:17.178 --> 23:19.485
between Asian women
and white men.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.704
But Thuy and Ken
have been together

23:21.748 --> 23:23.445
since Binh was a young boy.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.447
- He could have turned on them
more recently,

23:25.491 --> 23:27.710
especially if he was triggered.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.147
- Yeah, like finding out

23:30.191 --> 23:31.845
his stepdad was cheating
on his mom.

23:31.888 --> 23:35.501
I get the feeling that
Ken is still hiding something.

you knew the attacker

23:53.823 --> 23:56.130
- How do you know Binh?
- I don't.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.524
He's the son
of one of my guys.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.960
- One of your guys.
What do you mean by that?

24:00.003 --> 24:01.744
- One of my regulars, Ken.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.093
He's so proud of that boy.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.052
He takes every chance he can
to talk about him

24:05.095 --> 24:06.227

24:06.270 --> 24:09.230
He's got a bunch of 'em
on his phone.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.841
- So you recognized Binh
from a photograph.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.627
- You gotta be sharp and have
sharp eyes to do what I do.

24:14.670 --> 24:18.065
I pay attention to everything,
all the time.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.459
The second before
he threw that bomb,

24:20.502 --> 24:22.765
I knew it was him.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.114
Am I wrong?

24:24.158 --> 24:27.030
- Nope, nope.
Actually, you're very right.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.772
- Can you confirm that this is
the man you're talking about?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.472
- Yeah. That's Ken.

24:35.735 --> 24:38.215
- Any chance you had a more
intimate relationship with Ken?

24:38.259 --> 24:40.740
- Lord, no.

There has never been
anything between us

24:43.003 --> 24:44.570

to think it's a good thing.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.819

It's hard for me to believe
that he sat on this information

25:25.306 --> 25:28.091
for just under a week and
he didn't tell you about it.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.789
- No one told me anything.

25:29.832 --> 25:33.140
Not Binh, not my husband.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.098
I should have noticed
something was wrong,

25:35.142 --> 25:36.535

25:36.578 --> 25:39.538

about my back surgery.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.844
- It's not your fault.

25:45.065 --> 25:48.634
- Your surgery wasn't pushed
because of the pandemic.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.157
Your husband canceled it
because he gambled away

25:50.200 --> 25:52.159
the money to pay for it.

All of it.

Binh has a lot more
to worry about.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.647

26:01.690 --> 26:03.257
You need that back surgery.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.824
