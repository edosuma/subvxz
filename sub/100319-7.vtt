WEBVTT

00:06.429 --> 00:08.052
Are you crying?

00:08.570 --> 00:10.381
What, I'm not allowed
to get a little emotional

00:10.405 --> 00:12.156
at a superhero movie?

00:12.181 --> 00:14.952
Lives were lost, Zoey.
Ethical questions were raised.

00:14.977 --> 00:17.188
And yet, not a single character

00:17.212 --> 00:19.284
flapped their arms when they flew.

00:22.029 --> 00:24.178
Oh, good, Max, you're here, too. Scooch.

00:24.203 --> 00:26.297
And we're gonna turn this off.

00:26.321 --> 00:27.832
No, no, no! There's an
amazing scene after the credits.

00:27.856 --> 00:29.321
- We're gonna miss it now.
- If you want to see

00:29.345 --> 00:31.802
grown-ass men run around in unitards,
go to the Castro.

00:32.046 --> 00:34.256
Anyways, I need your help with Eddie.

00:34.281 --> 00:37.209
I slid into his DMs.
That boy is so cryptic.

00:37.234 --> 00:39.076
I asked him if he
wanted to go get drinks,

00:39.101 --> 00:40.244
and he wrote back "K."

00:40.268 --> 00:43.147
He only responds in one letter. "K"?

00:43.171 --> 00:45.913
- Who does that?
- Oh, my God.

00:45.938 --> 00:48.652
- Are you dating Hercules?
- I introduced them.

00:48.677 --> 00:50.254
I'm actually a pretty
exceptional wingman.

00:50.278 --> 00:52.056
Boy, you made one introduction.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.491
You did not officiate the wedding.

00:53.515 --> 00:55.093
Well, I'd be exceptional at that, too,

00:55.117 --> 00:57.261
and it would be my greatest honor.

00:57.285 --> 01:00.164
Zoey, thank you for
reinstating Movie Night.

01:00.188 --> 01:01.906
I really miss getting our hang time in.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.531
Me, too.

01:06.569 --> 01:08.672
You were so helpful with
my dad the other night.

01:08.697 --> 01:12.109
It made me realize that
I need more Max in my life.

01:12.384 --> 01:15.179
And it reminded me that
you need better popcorn,

01:15.203 --> 01:18.038
because that skinny stuff
tastes like buttered sadness.

01:18.917 --> 01:20.917
- Night.
- Night.

01:23.704 --> 01:24.991
What is that look?

01:25.016 --> 01:26.789
You know damn well what this look is.

01:26.814 --> 01:28.125
Reinstating Movie Night,

01:28.150 --> 01:29.806
touching that boy on the shoulder.

01:29.831 --> 01:31.010
You gonna give him the wrong impression,

01:31.034 --> 01:32.912
and we both know Max burns

01:32.937 --> 01:35.548
white hot white boy love for you.

01:36.660 --> 01:40.259
I thought about that,
and then I realized

01:40.284 --> 01:43.400
things only got weird when
I heard him sing to me.

01:43.425 --> 01:45.541
So, if I never got this power,

01:45.566 --> 01:47.915
I'd still be having Movie
Night every week with Max.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.105
Just because that's what's
going on in his head

01:50.130 --> 01:51.507
doesn't mean he's gonna act on it.

01:51.532 --> 01:53.584
Just, let's talk about you, okay?

01:53.608 --> 01:54.974
Hmm.

01:56.445 --> 01:58.556
You just responded "K" back to him?

01:58.580 --> 01:59.860
Hell, yeah.

01:59.885 --> 02:01.328
You wanna play games, Eddie?

02:01.353 --> 02:03.157
Let's play games.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.181
Okay. All right.

02:08.205 --> 02:09.783
- You got it?
- Yeah.

02:09.809 --> 02:11.620
Okay.

02:11.645 --> 02:14.345
Hold on a sec. I wanna
make sure he has extra support.

02:14.370 --> 02:16.835
Oh, so like, the opposite of
what you did for me and Emily.

02:16.860 --> 02:19.117
Maybe if you would've told
Emily how you were feeling,

02:19.142 --> 02:21.312
about the baby coming,
instead of acting like a baby,

02:21.336 --> 02:23.081
she wouldn't have asked for
my opinion in the first place.

02:23.105 --> 02:25.415
The opinion I told you
very clearly not to give?

02:25.440 --> 02:26.648
- That opinion?
- Um...

02:26.673 --> 02:29.306
Could I speak to you both privately?

02:32.709 --> 02:33.977
What is it? I gotta get to work.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.056
And I gotta get to any
room that he's not in.

Can we help you with something?

03:26.835 --> 03:29.226
As a matter of fact, you can.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.970
I need you to get over

03:30.995 --> 03:33.000
this childish thing
that you're both doing

03:33.025 --> 03:35.134
and stop fighting in
front of your father.

03:35.159 --> 03:36.970
I mean, things are hard enough already,

03:36.995 --> 03:39.874
especially now that I have decided

03:39.899 --> 03:42.000
to hire a full-time caregiver.

03:42.025 --> 03:44.929
And I know that's the right
and logical medical decision

03:44.953 --> 03:47.498
but it's just... hard to accept

03:47.522 --> 03:49.923
that I can't do this all
on my own anymore.

03:49.948 --> 03:53.681
Mom, please do not feel guilty.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.876
He can't walk anymore.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.907
- Yeah, and you can't carry him.
- I know.

03:57.932 --> 04:00.400
I'm still wrapping my
head around all of it.

04:00.425 --> 04:02.403
Don't worry. We will
find the best caregiver

04:02.428 --> 04:04.239
in the whole city and I'll help you.

04:04.264 --> 04:06.212
That would be great. I've already set up

04:06.237 --> 04:07.751
some interviews for this afternoon,

04:07.776 --> 04:09.120
so you can join me.

04:09.144 --> 04:11.040
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:11.065 --> 04:13.220
What am I gonna do about the two of you?

04:15.559 --> 04:16.695
I'll try to let it go.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.942
I mean, I guess you did
kinda help me and Emily

04:19.968 --> 04:22.912
talk about some things
and work through them.

04:22.937 --> 04:24.754
I'm sorry, I can't quite hear you.

04:24.779 --> 04:29.239
Are you saying that I
actually helped you?

04:29.264 --> 04:31.684
I'm saying that we
share the same mother,

04:31.709 --> 04:33.578
and I like to see her happy.

04:33.602 --> 04:35.568
I like it when you're happy, too.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.873
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.575
We still on for lunch?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.055
Yeah, but let's try
something different today.

04:44.079 --> 04:45.178
How about a food court?

04:45.203 --> 04:46.657
I didn't peg you for a food court guy.

04:46.681 --> 04:48.648
Yeah, well, I love me some options.

04:59.724 --> 05:01.811
Dude, killer party.

05:01.836 --> 05:04.074
And that massive charcuterie board?

05:04.099 --> 05:06.399
- Pretty epic.
- Thanks.

05:06.995 --> 05:08.795
How about that smoked gouda?

05:09.393 --> 05:10.526
Hmm.

05:11.706 --> 05:14.518
How about those smoked roses?

05:20.748 --> 05:22.467
Zoey, you got a minute?

05:25.506 --> 05:27.576
I'm sorry about the roses comment.

05:27.601 --> 05:31.825
And the actual roses.
Both things, really.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.327
I was thinking about
texting you this weekend,

05:33.351 --> 05:35.372
and then I realized
that's kind of what got us

05:35.397 --> 05:36.807
into this mess in the first place.

05:36.831 --> 05:37.987
Well, however it started,

05:38.012 --> 05:39.443
I realized that I have
been leaning on you

05:39.467 --> 05:41.045
way too much about my dad stuff,

05:41.069 --> 05:42.363
which is why I think

05:42.388 --> 05:44.182
we just gotta go back
to being co-workers.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.988
Think it'll help keep things
aboveboard and professional.

05:47.276 --> 05:49.080
I totally agree.

05:49.105 --> 05:50.233
- All right.
- We are gonna be

05:50.257 --> 05:52.457
ultra-professional from now on.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.652
And with that, I bid you good day.

06:00.981 --> 06:02.519
I never look at her in the eyes, anyway,

06:02.543 --> 06:04.402
but I feel like I should maybe today.

06:04.702 --> 06:05.702
I'm gonna try it.

06:05.727 --> 06:07.058
What's the crisis? Did I cause it?

06:07.082 --> 06:08.372
This is literally gonna blow your mind,

06:08.396 --> 06:10.341
but Joan and Charlie
are getting a divorce.

06:10.365 --> 06:12.910
It's all over the tech news.
Can you believe it?

06:13.519 --> 06:16.313
Apparently you can and
perhaps already knew?

06:17.030 --> 06:19.291
I think I'm gonna be
sick. Joan and Charlie

06:19.316 --> 06:21.332
were the closest thing we
have to American royalty.

06:21.357 --> 06:23.277
I was this close to getting
commemorative plates.

06:23.302 --> 06:24.989
What do you guys think
she did to drive him away?

06:25.013 --> 06:27.269
Did you ever think that
maybe it was Charlie's fault?

06:27.294 --> 06:28.806
Charlie's only fault was
making a video game

06:28.830 --> 06:30.327
I sat and played for so many hours

06:30.352 --> 06:31.908
I had to get my baby toe amputated.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.165
- You did?
- Two-thirds.

06:34.189 --> 06:37.268
Hi. Everyone having a fun gossip sesh

06:37.292 --> 06:39.270
about the boss's marriage? I want in.

06:39.294 --> 06:40.838
Guys, don't fall for it. She's the boss.

06:40.862 --> 06:43.774
Relax, I know the news
of my divorce broke today

06:43.798 --> 06:46.844
because I had my publicist
plant it along with

06:46.868 --> 06:49.413
a photo of me in hot riding pants

06:49.437 --> 06:52.316
and Charlie in Tevas at a Phish concert.

06:52.341 --> 06:54.129
So Leif and I have come up with

06:54.154 --> 06:57.316
a fantastic idea that's gonna
blow your minds. Let's go.

06:58.019 --> 07:00.223
You may recall Simon's engagement party,

07:00.248 --> 07:02.526
where Zoey tried to burn the place down.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.261
Well, while that was going on,

07:04.285 --> 07:07.604
Leif and I came up with an idea

07:07.629 --> 07:10.244
that we think is going to
be pretty revolutionary.

07:10.269 --> 07:12.393
It's called The Chirp.

07:12.418 --> 07:14.426
- The Chirp!
- Don't do that.

07:14.451 --> 07:17.574
So, The Chirp is a Bluetooth
earpiece with a high-res camera.

07:17.599 --> 07:20.878
It uses AI and facial
recognition technology

07:20.902 --> 07:23.893
to gather information on
everything the user sees.

07:23.918 --> 07:26.083
It'll search public and
personal databases,

07:26.107 --> 07:28.433
filter the results,
and then chirp in your ear

07:28.458 --> 07:30.553
the exact thing you need
to know in real time.

07:30.578 --> 07:33.902
No more forgetting the name of
your coworker's forgettable husband.

07:33.927 --> 07:36.019
Or wondering what brand of kale chips

07:36.044 --> 07:37.288
the man next to you is eating

07:37.313 --> 07:39.079
when you're both out
birdwatching together.

07:39.921 --> 07:42.261
'Kay. We'll work on the examples.

07:42.286 --> 07:44.917
That sounds great.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.298
How would you like the
team to take it from here?

07:47.323 --> 07:50.107
Well, I think Leif and I are
just fine on our own for now,

07:50.131 --> 07:52.472
but we'll let you know
what we need in the future

07:52.497 --> 07:55.343
and until then,
stop gawking and start coding.

07:55.624 --> 07:57.113
Get to work.

07:57.464 --> 07:58.681
Um, Joan?

07:58.706 --> 08:01.318
Could I, um,
just talk to you for a second?

08:01.342 --> 08:03.120
Um, I wanted to talk about The Chirp.

08:03.144 --> 08:06.424
- Ah.
- Since I am technically

08:06.448 --> 08:11.607
Leif's... supervisor,
you don't want me to...

08:11.632 --> 08:13.597
No, just sit tight.

08:13.621 --> 08:15.166
We're working so closely on it,

08:15.190 --> 08:17.133
I think we're just gonna cook
it a little while longer.

08:17.157 --> 08:18.882
We'll let you know if
we need you, thanks.

08:21.865 --> 08:23.273
Okay.

08:23.298 --> 08:25.543
Leif. Bro?

08:25.567 --> 08:28.265
I am so proud of you right now.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.310
But... why didn't you tell me?

08:30.335 --> 08:32.419
Sorry, it was all on
a need-to-know basis.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.618
The time I got to second
base with my third cousin

08:34.642 --> 08:36.607
was a need-to-know basis,
but I told you about it.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.562
I've just been really busy
with The Chirp, okay?

08:39.082 --> 08:40.423
But hey, I'll make it up to you

08:40.448 --> 08:42.126
when we celebrate
the Spell-iversary, right?

08:42.150 --> 08:43.429
Now we're talking.

08:43.453 --> 08:46.830
Everybody, as you all know,
Spell-iversary is...

08:46.855 --> 08:48.732
The day you both celebrate winning

08:48.756 --> 08:51.402
the National Spelling Bee at age 11.

08:51.426 --> 08:53.304
Yeah, you only
tell us about it every year.

08:53.329 --> 08:55.585
Well, excuse us, you ischiocerite.

08:55.610 --> 08:57.421
- Ishy-occshu-what?
- Sorry.

08:57.446 --> 08:58.975
You need a country of origin, bro?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.644
Or you want me to use it in a sentence?

09:00.668 --> 09:01.979
Hey, Leif, I bet these troglodytes

09:02.003 --> 09:04.358
wouldn't make it past round
three, am I right?

09:07.830 --> 09:11.030
Hey, uh, what's a good
word for "hung out to dry"?

09:12.483 --> 09:14.398
"Repudiated."

09:14.681 --> 09:17.646
- Leif looked so smug today.
- Yeah.

09:17.671 --> 09:19.240
With his evil little grin

09:19.265 --> 09:21.710
and his well-tailored pants.
He's clearly doing all of this

09:21.735 --> 09:22.761
to get back at me for the peer reviews

09:22.785 --> 09:24.483
and I wasn't even the
one who dinged him.

09:25.327 --> 09:27.202
Max, are you okay?

09:27.227 --> 09:30.607
You look... pale... er than usual.

09:30.632 --> 09:32.858
No, I'm fine. I'm actually...

09:32.883 --> 09:35.280
I'm actually really, uh, happy.

09:35.305 --> 09:36.937
You don't look happy.

09:36.962 --> 09:38.615
You look ill.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.999
Everything's okay, it's just...

09:41.823 --> 09:45.889

And we only had like three rehearsals.

11:03.825 --> 11:05.603
There's this whole
online flash mob service.

11:05.627 --> 11:07.960
- This isn't even a real baby.
- It's not.

11:07.985 --> 11:09.913
I have fliers if you want.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.943
This is unexpected, and amazing,

11:13.968 --> 11:17.381
but, um, I'm very confused
and I have to go.

11:17.405 --> 11:18.771
I'm sorry.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.460
That's not usually a very good sign.

11:22.809 --> 11:26.789
That was some real messed up...

Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie

11:37.523 --> 11:39.526
You okay? You look shaken.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.824
What?

11:40.849 --> 11:42.938
Oh, yeah, uh...

11:43.541 --> 11:45.346
Today has been... nope.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.387
Nope, nope.
We are "keeping it professional."

11:48.702 --> 11:50.510
This is not business-related.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.979
Yes, right. My bad.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.160
Carry on.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.902
Thanks.

11:58.244 --> 12:00.082
Ooh. Zoey?

12:02.691 --> 12:05.019
I know that you're upset
about not being included

12:05.044 --> 12:07.596
in The Chirp so far, but you will be.

12:07.621 --> 12:08.854
It's just a matter of time.

12:08.879 --> 12:11.174
That's great. I'm great. It's all great.

12:11.199 --> 12:13.801
I am also great. I mean, I will be.

12:13.826 --> 12:16.354
Now that the news of the
divorce is made public,

12:16.379 --> 12:19.142
I really need to pump the brakes
on some of the bad behavior...

12:19.580 --> 12:20.963
Excessive drinking,

12:20.988 --> 12:24.465
buying a ranch in Montana
to go with my riding pants.

12:25.065 --> 12:26.276
Oops.

12:26.301 --> 12:30.846
But I feel great and I'm
gonna be totally fine.

12:30.871 --> 12:32.688
- Really?
- Mm-hmm!

12:33.301 --> 12:34.824
Well...

12:34.848 --> 12:37.323
- onwards and upwards, then.
- Right?

12:37.348 --> 12:40.018
Who knows? Maybe I'll even try
getting out there, you know.

12:40.043 --> 12:43.471
Charlie and I only had
sex 3 1/2 times last year.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.893
How pathetic is that?

12:44.918 --> 12:47.957
I'm sorry, I'm stuck on the... half.

12:47.982 --> 12:50.561
When Richard Branson calls
"Time for dinner,"

12:50.586 --> 12:52.144
and you're staying
at his private island,

12:52.168 --> 12:54.496
you stop what you're doing
and you go to dinner.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.680
Ooh, Richard Branson.
Wonder if he's single.

12:58.016 --> 12:59.180
Can you Google that for me?

12:59.205 --> 13:00.946
- Of course.
- Thank you.

13:01.602 --> 13:06.014
These are the best candidates
that can start work immediately.

13:06.039 --> 13:08.858
All we need to find is someone competent

13:08.882 --> 13:12.608
and responsible and trustworthy

13:12.633 --> 13:14.897
and experienced.

13:14.921 --> 13:17.370
So basically we're looking
for an angel sent from heaven.

13:17.641 --> 13:20.706
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sure.

13:20.731 --> 13:24.112
What would you say is your
approach to in-home caregiving?

13:24.137 --> 13:27.432
Well, I provide a whole-body approach.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.101
To caregiving?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.486
Oh, yeah.

13:32.954 --> 13:35.933
Sorry, it's hard to concentrate

13:35.958 --> 13:37.736
with all the dark
energies in this house.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.964
Was someone murdered? Recently?

13:39.989 --> 13:41.572
No, two people.

13:42.159 --> 13:44.009
Sisters.

13:44.034 --> 13:45.565
My approach?

13:45.590 --> 13:46.948
I don't know, that's a thinker.

13:46.973 --> 13:49.901
Ah, I don't know,
I guess I'd say "needs-based."

13:49.926 --> 13:52.198
Like, if he needs to eat, let him eat.

13:52.223 --> 13:54.964
If he needs to sleep, let him sleep.

13:55.708 --> 13:59.773
Okay, uh, what would
you think about incorporating

13:59.798 --> 14:03.460
some type of exercise
routine into his life?

14:04.942 --> 14:08.382
What is he training for,
the New York marathon?

14:09.742 --> 14:11.156
I hate to break it to you, pal.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.710
I think you're gonna lose.

14:12.735 --> 14:15.734
What you should be
doing is online poker.

14:15.759 --> 14:18.343
It's all about sitting
at a table for hours.

14:18.368 --> 14:19.719
Guy with nowhere to go?

14:19.743 --> 14:21.039
He could make a killing.

14:24.403 --> 14:26.351
I see you're a registered nurse?

14:26.376 --> 14:28.164
Yes, for 29 years.

14:28.531 --> 14:31.749
That's amazing. So, um...

14:31.774 --> 14:34.812
How are you gonna celebrate
your 30th anniversary?

14:34.837 --> 14:36.615
Extending someone's life.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.398
How festive.

14:38.423 --> 14:39.765
I've worked with several patients

14:39.790 --> 14:41.960
with degenerative diseases.

14:41.985 --> 14:44.304
It's all about providing
proper nutrition

14:44.329 --> 14:46.984
and instituting a physiotherapy routine

14:47.009 --> 14:48.420
to avoid muscle atrophy.

14:48.445 --> 14:49.758
My goal is to keep your loved one

14:49.782 --> 14:52.398
as healthy as I can
for as long as I can.

14:56.065 --> 14:58.532
So Nancy, when can you start?

15:04.818 --> 15:06.281
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.951
Are you seriously hiding from me?

15:07.976 --> 15:09.687
No. I work in here all the time.

15:09.712 --> 15:11.712
Jamming on code, listening to tunes.

15:14.410 --> 15:17.195
This is a podcast on
the Golden State Killer.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.789
I listen to true crime
to calm myself. Uh...

15:21.195 --> 15:24.054
I'm sorry I just ran away.

15:24.079 --> 15:26.046
That was an amazing gesture.

15:26.071 --> 15:28.578
So amazing that it instantly
repelled you from me?

15:28.603 --> 15:31.482
'Cause I really did put
myself out there, Zo,

15:31.507 --> 15:33.070
and I'd appreciate it if you could do

15:33.095 --> 15:35.171
or say something in return.

15:35.196 --> 15:36.203
Look we both know

15:36.228 --> 15:37.874
I am not good with
feelings and emotions,

15:37.899 --> 15:39.804
and this is just a lot
for me to handle right...

15:39.829 --> 15:41.204
Okay, well,
you can't just leave me hanging.

15:41.228 --> 15:43.507
I really don't get you lately.

15:43.532 --> 15:46.144
I mean, you've been acting
weird for months now.

15:46.169 --> 15:48.546
One minute you're here,
the next minute you drift off

15:48.571 --> 15:51.445
into this... this Zoeyland,
and I just can't figure out

15:51.470 --> 15:53.110
what the hell's going
on in your head anymore.

15:53.134 --> 15:55.546
- Is this all 'cause of your dad?
- No.

15:55.571 --> 15:57.243
- It's not just my dad.
- Okay, then what is it?

15:57.267 --> 15:59.329
- Just tell me. I can handle it.
- It's not that I don't want

15:59.353 --> 16:00.430
to have that conversation.

16:00.455 --> 16:03.281
It's that I can't, really.

16:03.306 --> 16:06.018
Zoey, I just told you I loved you.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.682
I literally just sang my heart
out in front of a mall...

16:08.706 --> 16:10.512
I have a superpower! Okay?

16:12.114 --> 16:13.114
Okay, forget it.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.726
You know, you could have just
told me you weren't interested.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.428
- That probably would've hurt...
- I'm serious.

16:16.452 --> 16:18.380
I hear people's inner thoughts.

16:18.405 --> 16:21.130
They sing them to me, constantly.

16:21.155 --> 16:23.341
That's why I'm off in Zoeyland.

16:23.366 --> 16:25.216
I'm not who you think I am.

16:25.241 --> 16:27.286
I am a mutant.

16:27.311 --> 16:29.481
I am the X-Men

16:29.506 --> 16:31.911
meets "The Voice."

16:32.754 --> 16:34.687
Now do you understand?

16:35.398 --> 16:37.301
I'm sorry, what?!

16:40.349 --> 16:42.011
Okay, let me get this straight.

16:42.036 --> 16:43.781
I do this whole big flash mob

16:43.805 --> 16:45.316
where I confess how I really feel to you

16:45.340 --> 16:47.184
and you respond with
stories of earthquakes,

16:47.208 --> 16:48.552
magical x-ray machines,

16:48.576 --> 16:50.387
and endless musical
numbers in your head?

16:50.411 --> 16:52.456
Yes, it was actually
a magic MRI machine.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.131
Somehow that doesn't
make me feel any better.

16:54.155 --> 16:56.378
- Imagine how I feel.
- Should I imagine it?

16:56.403 --> 16:59.098
- Or should I just belt it out?
- This isn't a joke.

16:59.123 --> 17:02.704
You have no idea how this
has taken over my life.

17:02.729 --> 17:05.762
If this is really happening, then
what am I singing right now? Huh?

17:06.550 --> 17:07.741
You're not singing anything.

17:07.766 --> 17:09.800
What about Sam, what's he singing?

17:11.111 --> 17:12.755
It doesn't work that way.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.425
I can't just make it happen.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.202
Well, isn't that convenient?

17:20.864 --> 17:22.986
It's important to take his
vitals throughout the day

17:23.011 --> 17:24.887
to establish a baseline.

17:25.646 --> 17:27.590
Nancy, I cannot tell you

17:27.616 --> 17:29.987
how wonderful it is to have you here.

17:30.012 --> 17:33.230
When Mitch fell,
I just felt so helpless,

17:33.254 --> 17:34.398
but now that you're here I...

17:34.422 --> 17:36.044
Here's a list of medical equipment

17:36.069 --> 17:37.558
I suggest you purchase.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.271
Oh, okay, yeah,
you're all about the work.

17:40.295 --> 17:43.292
I... I totally get that. Um...

17:43.317 --> 17:45.209
Do we really need all these devices?

17:45.233 --> 17:47.178
Because Mitch is very concerned

17:47.202 --> 17:49.914
that this not feel like a sick house.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.448
But he is sick,

17:51.472 --> 17:54.200
and the patient's health is my priority.

17:56.244 --> 17:57.922
Could you call him Mitch?

17:57.946 --> 18:00.391
Oh, you... yes.

18:00.415 --> 18:03.616
Will you be purchasing
those items for Mitch?

18:05.545 --> 18:08.255
Um... what do you think, honey?

18:13.341 --> 18:14.550
Okay.

18:14.575 --> 18:16.161
Okay, huh.

18:16.186 --> 18:18.886
All right, well, I will get right on it.

18:28.584 --> 18:29.841
Thank you.

18:29.866 --> 18:31.559
Perfect. Bye bye.

18:32.314 --> 18:34.917
Dude. I just scored the best table

18:34.942 --> 18:38.387
and bottle service at Club Chaos
tonight for Spell-iversary.

18:38.412 --> 18:40.458
That sounds empyreal.

18:40.483 --> 18:43.166
That means "sublime"
for you guys in the cheap seats.

18:43.191 --> 18:44.675
It's gonna be lit. I've got an in

18:44.700 --> 18:46.937
with these hot Berkeley girls
who said they'd stop by.

18:46.961 --> 18:49.573
Rumor has it... they like sex.

18:49.597 --> 18:51.098
Leif, we're back in.

18:55.589 --> 18:58.281
You guys are all invited, obviously.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.113
Think I'm gonna take a raincheck.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.464
And I think I'm gonna pretend

That's impossible.
Tobin doesn't have feelings.

19:59.334 --> 20:02.575
I didn't think so either,
but apparently he does.

20:03.507 --> 20:07.316
It's something about Leif
and their relationship

20:07.341 --> 20:10.044

20:48.550 --> 20:51.308
Okay, let's just end this
insanity once and for all.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.063
Hey, Tobin. You good?

20:53.087 --> 20:55.284
Your mama thought so last night.

20:55.309 --> 20:57.794
Thanks, buddy, that'll be all.
I'm sorry, Zoey,

20:57.819 --> 20:59.762
- but you can't convince me.
- You know, you're right.

20:59.786 --> 21:02.072
I may not be able
to convince you, but...

21:02.096 --> 21:03.707
Hell yeah, Zoey's got powers.

21:03.731 --> 21:06.223
Did she put you up to this?
Are you two pranking me?

21:06.248 --> 21:07.801
Ain't nobody got time to prank you, boy.

21:07.825 --> 21:10.144
This is very, very real, Sir Max-a-lot.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.716
Mo's actually been helping
me figure out how it works.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.448
He's been keeping tabs on the rules.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.114
The rules? And just how many are there?

21:17.139 --> 21:18.155
Well, let's see.

21:18.179 --> 21:19.790
Zoey can hear heart songs.

21:19.814 --> 21:21.258
Her term, not mine.

21:21.282 --> 21:23.698
The heart songs always
reveal people's inner truth.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.229
Zoey has a responsibility to help people

21:25.253 --> 21:26.441
when she hears their songs.

21:26.466 --> 21:27.931
Otherwise,
she'll be haunted by those songs,

21:27.955 --> 21:29.299
which we've learned is no bueno.

21:29.323 --> 21:31.835
Sometimes time freezes
when she hears a song.

21:31.859 --> 21:33.895
- Other times, they go...
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.753
So now Zoey can manipulate
the laws of physics, too?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.742
This is really incredible.

21:38.766 --> 21:39.878
Ain't it, though?

21:39.903 --> 21:41.708
He's being sarcastic.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.855
Look, Max, I know
this is hard for you to believe,

21:43.880 --> 21:44.995
but it's all true.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.917
Look, I...
I would really love to believe it.

21:46.941 --> 21:50.487
It's just that I need more
concrete evidence and proof.

21:50.512 --> 21:51.685
Okay.

21:52.094 --> 21:53.989
There might be one way to do that.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.093
But you're not gonna like it.

21:57.571 --> 21:58.823
What is it?

21:58.848 --> 22:01.821
We're gonna have go to
clubbing tonight with Tobin.

22:03.685 --> 22:05.191
You think Tobin will like these?

22:05.216 --> 22:06.737
Shots of Goldschlager? Yeah.

22:06.762 --> 22:10.308
It's the official drink of
douchebros trying to be classy.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.669
Thanks for getting us in, Mo.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.856
No problem. Eddie's coming too.

22:13.881 --> 22:15.115
At least that's what I understood

22:15.139 --> 22:16.450
when I texted him "Wanna come?"

22:16.475 --> 22:18.486
And then he wrote back the letter "Y,"

22:18.511 --> 22:20.085
which I'm gonna assume is "yes"

22:20.110 --> 22:22.481
and not "Y are you texting me?
I'm not into you."

22:22.506 --> 22:24.333
Oh, there's Tobin.

22:26.030 --> 22:29.159
You sure that guy's hiding
some deep emotional pain?

22:29.184 --> 22:31.067
Isn't it obvious?

22:31.092 --> 22:32.997
Don't make me spell that, bro.

22:33.318 --> 22:36.019
All right. Spell-iversary!

22:37.209 --> 22:40.583
- Party people in the hizzy!
- You showed up.

22:40.608 --> 22:42.176
Couldn't miss such a big night.

22:42.201 --> 22:45.028
Happy Spell-iversary, playah.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.137
All right, I'll let you guys stay,

22:47.162 --> 22:49.176
only because that is my favorite drink.

22:49.747 --> 22:51.770
- Oh, this is my friend Mo.
- What's up, Mo?

22:51.795 --> 22:53.661
Happy to spell-ebrate with you.

22:53.686 --> 22:55.403
Mad respect for your pun game.

22:55.428 --> 22:57.380
So where's Leif?

22:57.405 --> 22:59.116
Oh, he's, uh, running late, I guess.

22:59.141 --> 23:01.231
Running late to Spell-iversary?

23:01.256 --> 23:02.669
He'll be here.

23:02.694 --> 23:03.786
That's odd.

23:03.811 --> 23:05.395
- Isn't that odd, Max?
- Uh...

23:05.420 --> 23:06.693
Is everything all right with you two?

23:06.717 --> 23:08.395
What? What are you talking about?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.833
I don't know, I just...
I... I... I'm sensing

23:10.858 --> 23:13.575
a little bit less man
love than usual lately.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.864
- Nah, we're good, Zoey.
- I don't think you are good.

23:15.889 --> 23:18.333
I think something's
going on between you guys

23:18.358 --> 23:22.411
and you don't... wanna speak about it.

23:22.607 --> 23:23.950
But here's the thing...

23:23.975 --> 23:25.808
I know it's bothering you.

23:26.472 --> 23:27.782
Please.

23:30.894 --> 23:32.536
Everything okay, Tobes?

23:32.561 --> 23:35.762
Yep. Just gotta go drain the dragon.

23:38.922 --> 23:41.293
Well, that really convinced me.

23:41.318 --> 23:42.801
To Spell-iversary!

23:42.826 --> 23:45.122
Spell-iversary!

23:49.059 --> 23:50.676
To Spell-iversary?

23:50.701 --> 23:52.934
To Spelliversary.

23:52.959 --> 23:54.809
I'm not doing this. Look,

23:54.834 --> 23:57.895
Tobin's been gone for four
whole house songs now,

23:57.920 --> 24:00.747
or maybe one house song
that's lasted as long as four.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.520
I honestly can't tell
with all this pounding

24:02.545 --> 24:03.723
in my head right now.

24:03.748 --> 24:05.856
Maybe I was too hard on him.

24:05.881 --> 24:07.723
I'm usually more subtle
but I was really trying

24:07.748 --> 24:10.450
to prove to you my abilities.
Can you go check on him?

24:10.475 --> 24:11.997
What? No, I'm not checking on him.

24:12.022 --> 24:13.982
Men don't check on men in
bathrooms. It's not a thing.

24:14.006 --> 24:17.192
I just saw Tobin leave,
but guess who's here?

24:17.217 --> 24:19.223
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.606
Wanna dance?

24:21.631 --> 24:24.075
Is that all you have to
say to me and my friends?

24:24.100 --> 24:26.942
I really don't understand why
we're not already dancing.

24:26.967 --> 24:28.599
Come on.

24:30.454 --> 24:32.317
Okay, that's it, I only came to see

24:32.342 --> 24:33.614
if Tobin was an emotional mess,

24:33.639 --> 24:35.747
but now that he's gone, so am I.

24:41.053 --> 24:44.676
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

24:45.339 --> 24:48.848

Okay, remember how Mo didn't
know where he stood with him?

26:21.537 --> 26:22.951
Here's the thing... I
just heard them sing,

26:22.975 --> 26:25.654
and I bet you anything they
are about to start kissing.

26:25.679 --> 26:27.489
In three,

26:27.514 --> 26:29.934
two, one...

26:31.517 --> 26:33.505
It doesn't prove anything.

26:33.530 --> 26:35.841
Two people were dancing and
then they started making out.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.083
That's a normal sequence of events.

26:38.108 --> 26:39.817
Look, if you're gonna keep sticking

26:39.842 --> 26:42.122
to this insane superpower thing,

26:42.147 --> 26:45.356
then... I think we
gotta stop hanging out.

26:49.504 --> 26:51.348
Max, don't go. I can prove it.

26:51.373 --> 26:53.151
No, you can't! There's no way to prove

26:53.176 --> 26:54.700
you can see inside people's hearts.

26:54.725 --> 26:56.491
Even though I saw inside yours?

26:57.488 --> 26:59.223
What are you talking about?

26:59.884 --> 27:02.239
After I got the power...

27:02.837 --> 27:04.692
you sang to me.

27:05.170 --> 27:07.181
Love songs.

27:07.206 --> 27:09.067
Lots of love songs.

27:09.910 --> 27:11.624
I did?

27:11.649 --> 27:13.036
Yeah.

27:13.061 --> 27:16.645
And you didn't do anything about it?

27:16.670 --> 27:18.516
I did something.

27:18.541 --> 27:20.348
What did you do?

27:21.949 --> 27:25.456
You... set me up with Autumn.

27:25.481 --> 27:27.193
Yes.

27:27.606 --> 27:29.517
To get me away from you?

27:30.058 --> 27:31.696
Yes, I did.

27:31.721 --> 27:33.192
Wow.

27:33.780 --> 27:35.926
Well, now I know
you're telling the truth,

27:35.951 --> 27:37.068
because no one would ever lie

27:37.092 --> 27:38.521
about doing something that heartless.

27:38.545 --> 27:39.971
- Max...
- How can you claim to care

27:39.996 --> 27:42.231
about me, to be my friend,
when you knew how I felt

27:42.256 --> 27:44.020
all this time and said nothing?

27:44.045 --> 27:46.637
I mean, wow, were we
ever even friends at all?

27:46.670 --> 27:49.762
Yes! We were friends. We are friends.

27:49.787 --> 27:52.395
Well, not anymore.
I really hope that you

27:52.420 --> 27:55.114
have a wonderful, musical life,

27:55.139 --> 27:56.989
because I can't...

28:10.950 --> 28:12.754
Morning, sunshine.

28:12.779 --> 28:14.036
I thought I'd drop by

28:14.061 --> 28:16.224
with some good news on my way to work.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.192
Guess who I heard sing last night?

28:18.217 --> 28:19.934
Oh, my God, Eddie,
at the club, last night.

28:19.959 --> 28:20.981
Tell me everything.

28:21.006 --> 28:23.097
Well, it was a hot Spanish song.

28:23.122 --> 28:25.309
You and Eddie were
both singing and dancing.

28:25.334 --> 28:27.317
Quite seductively, I might add.

28:27.342 --> 28:30.184
Most importantly,
I can tell that he's really into you.

28:30.530 --> 28:33.513
You know, maybe he's just shy
and communicates more with his...

28:33.538 --> 28:35.907
Body? Yeah,
we figured that out last night.

28:35.932 --> 28:37.419
Hey, Zoey.

28:37.444 --> 28:40.304
- Hi.
- Wanna get breakfast?

28:42.131 --> 28:43.664
K.

28:48.147 --> 28:50.324
- Tell me about Max.
- Oh.

28:50.934 --> 28:54.004
Uh... he hates me.

28:54.029 --> 28:56.871
Doesn't believe me.
Thinks I'm horrible person.

28:56.896 --> 28:58.433
Doesn't want to be friends with me.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.208
I tossed and turned about
it in bed all night.

29:00.232 --> 29:01.754
Hmm. That explains the puffiness.

29:01.779 --> 29:04.758
Maybe I'm not supposed to
have any friends but you, Mo.

29:04.783 --> 29:07.301
Every time I hear someone's
thoughts it ruins everything.

29:07.326 --> 29:10.832
This is exactly why Superman
needed his Fortress of Solitude.

29:10.857 --> 29:12.270
Mm-mm. Don't blame it on your power.

29:12.294 --> 29:13.294
This one's all on you.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.264
What's that supposed to mean?

29:15.289 --> 29:17.113
Old Zoey steamrolled through life

29:17.138 --> 29:18.449
living in a black and white world.

29:18.473 --> 29:19.651
You're not wrong.

29:19.676 --> 29:20.854
But New Zoey has been given a gift

29:20.878 --> 29:22.613
to know how people really feel,

29:22.638 --> 29:24.176
and it's helped you make connections

29:24.201 --> 29:26.051
and have hard conversations.

29:26.076 --> 29:27.910
Real friends owe that to each other.

29:27.935 --> 29:29.879
Max and I had a hard
conversation last night

29:29.904 --> 29:31.091
and we are definitely not better for it.

29:31.115 --> 29:32.402
You know damn well that is not

29:32.427 --> 29:34.277
the hard conversation
that I'm talking about.

29:34.302 --> 29:37.261
That boy organized an entire flash mob

29:37.286 --> 29:40.070
professing his love for you,
and what did you do in return?

29:40.594 --> 29:42.617
You told him about your
powers to avoid saying

29:42.642 --> 29:44.487
how you feel about him.

29:44.512 --> 29:45.856
He deserves an answer.

29:45.881 --> 29:49.180
But what if I... don't know how I feel?

29:49.205 --> 29:50.812
Then start with that.

29:50.837 --> 29:53.416
And if he's a good
friend he'll understand.

29:53.730 --> 29:56.265
Mo, I'm hungry.

29:56.936 --> 29:59.484
Now if you're a good friend...

29:59.729 --> 30:01.668
you'll leave and take that tea with you,

30:01.693 --> 30:04.523
because you know that that
boy needs some breakfast.

30:06.678 --> 30:08.305
Faster.

30:16.959 --> 30:18.617
Nancy.

30:19.147 --> 30:20.859
What is this?

30:21.146 --> 30:23.289
It's a hospital bed, Maggie.

30:24.176 --> 30:25.722
I mean...

30:27.257 --> 30:30.725
Why didn't you ask
me before you got that?

30:31.455 --> 30:33.250
I thought we agreed to make

30:33.275 --> 30:34.922
some necessary changes in the house.

30:34.947 --> 30:37.242
I know, but a change like that,

30:37.267 --> 30:41.281
it's... it's so... drastic. It's...

30:41.306 --> 30:43.884
- It's so clinical.
- I know.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.109
I understand, it is clinical.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.531
But as a health care professional,

30:48.556 --> 30:50.267
I'm only doing what I think is best.

30:50.292 --> 30:54.193
And that reminds me...
it's time for him to get some rest.

31:01.306 --> 31:03.586
Oh, oh, no, wait, don't turn that off.

31:03.611 --> 31:06.890
Mitch is a huge March Madness fan.

31:06.915 --> 31:09.383
He's gonna want to see that.

31:10.542 --> 31:11.914
What?

31:12.664 --> 31:15.883
Oh, "not tired, thirsty." He...

31:16.184 --> 31:18.680
"Milkshake." He... he wants...

31:18.705 --> 31:21.008
He loves chocolate milkshakes.

31:24.969 --> 31:27.086
So you want his blood sugar to spike

31:27.111 --> 31:28.547
instead of preserving his energy?

31:28.572 --> 31:32.242
Mrs. Clarke, is this about
what your husband wants,

31:32.267 --> 31:34.101
or what he needs?

31:40.066 --> 31:42.914
I think I know what my husband needs.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.586
The waitress dropped
this off after you left.

31:55.611 --> 31:58.646
Ironically, they spelled it wrong.

32:00.116 --> 32:02.586
Sorry if I drove you away last night.

32:02.611 --> 32:07.023
I've noticed some new dynamics
going on around here and...

32:07.048 --> 32:08.430
I didn't leave 'cause of you.

32:08.455 --> 32:11.601
I didn't mean to question
your relationship with Leif.

32:11.626 --> 32:14.233
You two are best friends and I'm just...

32:14.258 --> 32:15.687
What do you two call me?

32:15.712 --> 32:18.148
Agent Orange? Code Red?

32:18.672 --> 32:20.234
Lucille Balls?

32:20.259 --> 32:21.508
That was a good one.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.984
I know something's
wrong between you two,

32:24.009 --> 32:25.756
and if you want to talk about it...

32:25.781 --> 32:28.461
What kind of best friend
bails on Spell-iversary?

32:28.486 --> 32:30.594
That night's supposed to be sui generis!

32:30.619 --> 32:31.997
That means "of a class of its own."

32:32.021 --> 32:33.313
Obviously it's not as important to Leif

32:33.337 --> 32:34.649
as another late night at the office

32:34.673 --> 32:36.359
trying to boost his career.

32:36.384 --> 32:38.476
Still, priorities, bro.

32:40.321 --> 32:41.899
Have you talked to
him about any of this?

32:41.923 --> 32:43.532
Oh, you mean like when
we're getting our mani-pedis

32:43.556 --> 32:45.445
- and drinking frozé?
- Look, I know

32:45.470 --> 32:48.719
it sounds scary, but real
friends have hard conversations.

32:48.744 --> 32:51.476
They... owe it to each other.

32:51.501 --> 32:53.422
Leif doesn't have
time for a conversation.

32:53.447 --> 32:55.640
He's too busy crushing it with Joan.

32:55.665 --> 32:57.309
Well, I'm your boss,

32:57.334 --> 32:59.435
and I'm telling you The Chirp can wait.

33:08.827 --> 33:11.695
Hey, uh, we missed you last night.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.286
Sorry about that.

33:14.554 --> 33:16.367
They spelled it wrong.

33:23.219 --> 33:25.781
Uh, I'mma get deep for a hot second,

33:25.806 --> 33:28.351
so just bear with me. Um...

33:28.376 --> 33:29.820
When we met at the bee,

33:29.845 --> 33:31.742
I was just a shy kid from India

33:31.767 --> 33:33.941
who was the butt of all the
jokes on the playground,

33:33.966 --> 33:36.734
but you made me feel like
one of the cool kids.

33:36.759 --> 33:38.047
Cool is a relative term.

33:38.072 --> 33:39.703
I shared a thermos of soup with you.

33:39.728 --> 33:41.648
Yeah, dude, but that was everything.

33:41.673 --> 33:44.086
Everyone else looked
through me when I got there.

33:44.119 --> 33:45.662
I was just another immigrant

33:45.687 --> 33:47.367
whose parents had
made him learn every word

33:47.392 --> 33:49.032
in the English language
because they desperately

33:49.056 --> 33:50.758
wanted him to fit in.

33:51.192 --> 33:53.867
I guess that's why Spell-iversary
has meant so much to me.

33:53.892 --> 33:57.242
I get that. And I'm sorry,
I just... I had to work,

33:57.267 --> 33:58.789
and I lost track of time.

33:58.814 --> 34:01.157
Yeah, but stuff like this has
been going on for a while now.

34:01.181 --> 34:02.747
You wanna tell me what's up?

34:04.054 --> 34:05.380
I, um...

34:05.405 --> 34:07.765
I guess I have been pulling back.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.656
I'm just trying to make some
serious moves around here.

34:11.681 --> 34:15.156
And all you want to do is play around

34:15.181 --> 34:18.453
and brag about how many of
Zoey's pens you've hidden in the nest.

34:18.478 --> 34:20.844
There's at least 34 of them in there.

34:21.129 --> 34:24.014
You're starting to
seem like a liability, man.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.578
How are we supposed to run this place

34:25.603 --> 34:27.773
if people don't start to
take you more seriously?

34:27.797 --> 34:29.570
You want us to run this place?

34:29.594 --> 34:31.156
Yeah, dude.

34:31.181 --> 34:33.594
What's the point of rising
if we can't do it together?

34:34.547 --> 34:38.828
How about we focus
less on partying and...

34:39.031 --> 34:40.641
goofing around?

34:40.884 --> 34:44.514
And a little more on that grind? Yeah?

34:45.976 --> 34:47.643
Come here.

35:07.484 --> 35:10.109
Here to pour salt on my wounds?

35:10.134 --> 35:11.437
No.

35:12.199 --> 35:15.945
I'm here to do what I
should've done months ago.

35:19.981 --> 35:21.620
I didn't give you my answer

35:21.645 --> 35:25.035
after the flashmob because
my answer is messy.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.754
And complicated.

35:26.779 --> 35:28.098
And selfish.

35:28.122 --> 35:33.770
But... you deserve the truth,
so, here it is.

35:34.059 --> 35:35.739
I haven't even allowed
myself to consider

35:35.763 --> 35:36.873
going down a romantic road with you

35:36.897 --> 35:38.558
because it could mean I
could lose your friendship.

35:38.582 --> 35:40.637
- Or make it even stronger.
- Or maybe

35:40.662 --> 35:42.978
we could have an awful,
terrible breakup,

35:43.003 --> 35:44.581
and then I'd lose you forever.

35:44.605 --> 35:46.425
So you're afraid to even try?

35:46.450 --> 35:47.598
Yeah.

35:48.043 --> 35:49.504
I'm already losing my dad,

35:49.529 --> 35:53.255
and I can't bear the
thought of losing you, too.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.125
It's just... It's not the right time,

35:55.149 --> 35:57.075
and I'm not strong enough for it.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.128
So basically what you're saying is

35:59.153 --> 36:01.956
I'm too important to risk losing?

36:01.981 --> 36:03.762
Does that not make sense?

36:03.787 --> 36:06.533
In a way it's very... very flattering.

36:06.558 --> 36:08.303
Yeah, yeah, no, it's... It's really...

36:08.328 --> 36:11.012
It's like a really awesome
terrible rejection.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.426
Rejection?

36:12.451 --> 36:14.301
It is not a rejection.

36:14.785 --> 36:17.075
It's all coming from a place of love.

36:17.780 --> 36:21.984
Can you please just stay my best friend

36:22.009 --> 36:24.378
and not change this
special thing that we have?

36:24.403 --> 36:26.879
Hasn't it already changed, though?

36:27.251 --> 36:29.358
I mean, if you can hear my feelings,

36:29.383 --> 36:31.885
and I can't hear yours,
that's not a fair friendship.

36:31.910 --> 36:33.778
Okay, how about this?

36:34.350 --> 36:35.898
I'll be an open book from now on.

36:35.923 --> 36:37.701
You can ask me anything and I will be

36:37.725 --> 36:39.703
100% honest with you.

36:39.727 --> 36:41.371
Okay, yeah, that sounds great, Zo,

36:41.395 --> 36:43.840
but I'm not sure it's
gonna solve everything.

36:43.864 --> 36:46.998
Maybe not, but it's a start.

36:49.538 --> 36:51.616
I have to catch up on
all this work I missed

36:51.641 --> 36:53.385
while trying to fix Tobin,

36:53.410 --> 36:56.457
but can we please meet up later?

36:57.262 --> 36:58.456
I need us to be good.

36:58.481 --> 37:00.809
Yeah, I need us to be good, too, but

37:00.834 --> 37:03.270
you just threw a pretty
big bombshell at me.

37:03.641 --> 37:06.254
So... maybe we should press pause

37:06.279 --> 37:08.590
on things like Movie Night.

37:21.268 --> 37:22.450
Boo-yah!

37:22.475 --> 37:25.881
Take that,
"Pocket Pairs in Pennsylvania"!

37:27.975 --> 37:30.353
Sounds like you two are
really hitting it off.

37:30.377 --> 37:33.022
Yeah. We are taking all of the
money that Mitch is winning

37:33.046 --> 37:35.260
and we are gonna buy
you something real nice.

37:35.285 --> 37:37.026
- Hmm.
- Oh, forget it.

37:37.050 --> 37:40.096
He said he wants to
"blow it on the ponies."

37:40.120 --> 37:42.168
That is not cool, bud.

37:42.730 --> 37:45.575
I'm just kidding. He said he's thirsty.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.520
One chocolate shake coming up.

37:49.512 --> 37:51.043
Thank you.

38:02.949 --> 38:04.442
I have to admit,

38:04.467 --> 38:05.839
I was surprised to hear from you.

38:05.864 --> 38:08.582
I don't always make the
best first impression.

38:09.016 --> 38:11.393
It's not really about what I need.

38:11.418 --> 38:14.960
It's about what my husband
needs, and, um,

38:14.985 --> 38:17.797
right now he needs someone like you.

38:21.873 --> 38:23.984
What are you doing?

38:24.258 --> 38:26.758
Oh, I sneak some spinach in,

38:26.783 --> 38:28.577
just for the vitamins and minerals.

38:28.602 --> 38:30.126
I hope you don't mind.

38:31.231 --> 38:33.376
No, not at all.

38:34.624 --> 38:37.032
Just don't forget the whipped cream.

38:47.235 --> 38:49.313
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:57.789 --> 39:00.802
So you and Zoey, hanging out again.

39:00.888 --> 39:03.227
You weren't for a while there,
I noticed.

39:04.404 --> 39:06.749
Yeah, well, we're pretty tight.

39:06.774 --> 39:08.350
Didn't know you were keeping tabs.

39:08.375 --> 39:11.157
Not keeping tabs, per se...

39:11.932 --> 39:13.774
Were you guys ever a thing?

39:14.371 --> 39:17.483
Just... Zoey's special.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.294
She deserves to be with a good guy.

39:19.319 --> 39:21.719
Yeah. Well, she will be.

39:22.289 --> 39:23.822
One day.

39:34.888 --> 39:36.645
You know something?

39:36.670 --> 39:38.586
I think we might have something real.

39:38.611 --> 39:41.023
Something real and impressive.

39:41.048 --> 39:42.859
This could be a game-changer.

39:42.884 --> 39:44.219
I'm gonna loop Zoey in tomorrow.

39:44.244 --> 39:46.124
I think fresh eyes would help.

39:46.149 --> 39:49.001
Um, you know, I just want to say, Joan,

39:49.026 --> 39:52.077
I have had a blast working
on this project with you.

39:52.102 --> 39:53.944
I could not agree more.

39:53.969 --> 39:55.680
No, really, I mean it.

39:55.996 --> 40:00.281
You're intelligent, dynamic, creative...

40:00.602 --> 40:02.031
beautiful.

40:08.302 --> 40:10.735
♪ I put a spell on you ♪

40:15.732 --> 40:18.789

41:11.319 --> 41:14.242
And I just think that
there's something...

41:14.547 --> 41:17.012
special here.

41:17.037 --> 41:19.328
Something that could go all the way.

41:20.421 --> 41:23.151
Well, then, that's something

41:23.176 --> 41:25.164
that definitely shouldn't happen.

41:25.189 --> 41:26.967
And yet, it seems inevitable.

41:26.992 --> 41:28.833
It's a terrible idea.

41:28.858 --> 41:29.889
You're absolutely right.

41:29.914 --> 41:31.661
I'm in a position of power over you.

41:31.685 --> 41:34.764
It's wrong. You look like
you just started shaving,

41:34.788 --> 41:37.867
and it flies in the face
of everything I believe

41:37.891 --> 41:40.031
about workplace professionalism.

41:40.313 --> 41:41.979
I couldn't agree more.

41:43.048 --> 41:45.211
Glad we're on the same page.
