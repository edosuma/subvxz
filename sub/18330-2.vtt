WEBVTT

00:01.417 --> 00:04.208
( music playing )

00:06.917 --> 00:08.708
I'm not doing "Spectrum."

00:08.750 --> 00:11.792
Jack, I have the utmost
respect for you.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.417
Is it "the ut"?

00:13.458 --> 00:15.375
God, do I say "utmost" or "upmost"?

00:15.417 --> 00:18.083
Which one is it?
Is it ut or up?

00:22.208 --> 00:24.500
Wray, how you feeling?

00:24.542 --> 00:25.625
Jack, what are you doing here?

00:25.667 --> 00:27.125
How'd you even know
which hospital I was in?

00:27.166 --> 00:30.417
I just went to your house, called 911,
ambulance brought me here.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.333
Good to see a friendly face, buddy.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.542
- Ah, that's hot.
- Sorry.

00:34.583 --> 00:38.458
- That one's yours.
- Are you okay, buddy?

00:40.333 --> 00:44.291
Yes, matter of fact, never better,
because now I am 100% focused

00:44.333 --> 00:46.083
on "Spectrum" and
getting this movie made ASAP.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.250
Hmm. That's great.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.625
I can't wait to do this movie.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.750
I've got so many ideas.
Let's spitball some stuff.

00:51.792 --> 00:53.375
Spitball some ideas with me.

00:53.417 --> 00:54.542
- Yeah.
- Come on.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.375
- Let's spitball.
- Yeah.

00:56.417 --> 00:59.000
Okay, I'm just spitting.
Maybe it's a loogie.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.750
What if I'm not in it?

01:03.792 --> 01:05.792
In what?

01:05.834 --> 01:07.000
"Spectrum" the movie.

01:08.125 --> 01:12.583
Jack, I have the uh... most
respect for you.

01:12.625 --> 01:16.333
"Utmost." There is no "Spectrum"
without Cash Wayne.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.834
You see, this is why I wanted to talk
to you before the meeting.

01:18.875 --> 01:21.625
I just-- I can't do "Spectrum."

01:21.667 --> 01:26.583
- Can't or won't?
- It's kind of a "cwon't."

01:26.625 --> 01:29.959
I have to do literally
anything but "Spectrum."

01:30.000 --> 01:31.667
What else have you got?

01:31.708 --> 01:34.750
Screw you, also exactly.

01:34.792 --> 01:37.375
Ever since "Spectrum," all our--

01:37.417 --> 01:40.708
I'm sorry, officer.
The situation has worsened.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.625
Your partner
has slipped into a coma.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.458
You're talking to the wrong guy.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.917
I know. I'm practicing.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.917
Excuse me.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.000
After "Spect--"

01:56.041 --> 01:59.959
after "Spectrum,"
all I've done is sci-fi.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.250
It's like I'm on a merry-go-round

02:01.291 --> 02:02.792
that's just going round
and round and round.

02:02.834 --> 02:05.125
It's broken.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.917
How is that broken?

02:06.959 --> 02:08.917
Because I can't get off.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.000
I'm sorry, officer.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.375
The situation has worsened.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.959
Your partner
has slipped into a coma.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.208
That was actually really good.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.834
- Yeah.
- A lot of eye contact. It was warm.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.250
Thanks. It's showtime.

02:33.250 --> 02:37.125
Jack, "Spectrum"
launched your career.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.667
It launched my part-time job.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.667
Then tell your agents
you wanna go out for other things.

02:40.708 --> 02:43.792
I'm not good at
telling them anything, really.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.375
Wray, those people work for you.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.166
You tell them
this is show business.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.708
There is no business
without the show

02:49.750 --> 02:52.166
and you are the show.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.625
That's kinda easy for you to say

02:54.667 --> 02:56.000
because you get to do
whatever you want.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.959
Apparently not, because what
I want to do is make "Spectrum,"

02:59.000 --> 03:00.542
but I can't because
you won't do it.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.583
And I want to break out of sci-fi,

03:02.625 --> 03:05.417
but I can't do that
if I keep doing sci-fi.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.542
( sighs )
That never gets easier.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.500
Should've been a lawyer.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.500
"Doctor Cop Lawyer."

03:17.542 --> 03:19.625
You could do that show.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.750
No, that's a sci-fi show.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.500
You can't just stitch
three guys together.

03:23.542 --> 03:26.041
No, no, it's a drama.
It's very serious. It's a man.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.542
He's a doctor, he is a cop,
and he is a lawyer.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.208
That sounds good.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.500
See, if I could get into
something like that...

03:33.542 --> 03:34.625
You would do "Spectrum"?

03:34.667 --> 03:37.750
- Yeah.
- I can get you in with the director.

03:37.792 --> 03:38.792
After that, it's all on you.

03:38.834 --> 03:42.250
- Dude, thank you.
- Okay, okay, all right.

03:42.291 --> 03:45.542
Wray, can you help me tie Dale down?
He keeps trying to fall out of bed.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.917
- Faith!
- Jack!

03:47.959 --> 03:51.208
- I knew it.
- I knew it, too.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.125
How long has this been going on?

03:54.166 --> 03:56.125
- A few months.
- What?

03:56.166 --> 03:58.792
- You never told him.
- I'm telling him right now.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.291
Faith is sleeping with Dale.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.291
- It's disgusting.
- Oh, God, you're a child.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.875
- You-- no, I am not.
- You are, though.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.708
- You-- no, I'm not.
- You're both children.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.458
Hold it, you are the reason
she stinks at her job now.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.500
Both:
What?

04:10.542 --> 04:13.667
Any time Wray dates a woman
who has her ( expletive ) together,

04:13.708 --> 04:14.917
she loses her ( expletive ).

04:14.959 --> 04:16.791
My ( expletive ) is together.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.000
You missed the meeting today.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.625
Because I was out drinking
with Wray and my phone died.

04:22.208 --> 04:26.000
Oh, God. My ( expletive )
is no longer together.

04:26.041 --> 04:29.000
That's-- ( scoffs )

04:29.041 --> 04:31.375
- Just excuse me for a moment.
- Where are you going?

04:31.417 --> 04:34.125
I need to go take care
of my ( expletive ).

04:34.166 --> 04:36.959
You two? Need to take care
of your ( expletive ).

04:37.000 --> 04:39.250
Can someone take care
of my ( expletive )?

04:39.291 --> 04:42.291
I'm gonna go talk to Faith.
You talk to your agents.

04:42.333 --> 04:46.542
I am the show.
What I say go.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.083
Seriously, take it.
It's leaking!

04:50.125 --> 04:52.667
Oh, my God!

04:52.708 --> 04:54.291
It is leaking!

04:54.333 --> 04:56.667
Why would you hand this to me?

05:02.166 --> 05:03.500
( phone ringing )

05:03.542 --> 05:04.542
Middle Talent Agency.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.834
Gordon, put me through to Stephanie.
This is Wray Nerely!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.834
This is Daniel.
Stephanie was fired.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.375
I'm the new Gordon.
Stephanie's the new dead to us.

05:12.417 --> 05:15.667
- It's a volatile time.
- Wray: Gordon was promoted?

05:15.708 --> 05:17.166
Fine, then let me talk to him.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.125
( sighs )

05:19.166 --> 05:22.000
- ( phone ringing )
- Daniel: Wray Nerely for you on line one.

05:22.041 --> 05:27.083
Wray! Oh, honey,
I am so glad you called.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.583
Isn't that awful about Stephanie?

05:29.625 --> 05:30.834
Wray:
I never met her.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.875
I don't have an appointment,
and I don't care.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.750
This is Wray Nerely,
I am downstairs,

05:35.792 --> 05:37.291
and I am coming up!

05:37.333 --> 05:39.125
Yay, Wray!

05:39.166 --> 05:40.917
Oh, you silly billy,
you are welcome here

05:40.959 --> 05:42.542
whenever you want.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.542
( chuckles )
This is show business, Wray.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.583
You're the show.
There's no business without the show.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.125
You know what, that is--
I was gonna say that to you.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.959
- You're exactly what I--
- No.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.083
You gotta get out of here.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.417
Okay, could you talk
to the valet and tell him

05:55.458 --> 05:57.250
that I am the show,
because evidently

05:57.291 --> 05:59.083
if you don't have an appointment
they're very aggressive.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.750
Yes, of course.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.250
Daniel, could you please
speak to the valet?

06:05.417 --> 06:08.166
- Go away.
- ( chime, buzzing )

06:09.542 --> 06:11.125
Thank you, okay.
Now they're letting me out.

06:11.166 --> 06:14.291
So-- Jesus! God, man!

06:14.333 --> 06:15.792
I was getting out--
I'm not off the phone!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.083
I'm coming up!

06:18.959 --> 06:20.375
Dick.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.291
- Daniel.
- Pascal.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.625
Daniel is no longer at this desk.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.959
- It's a volatile time.
- Wow.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.041
Your agent will see you...

06:39.667 --> 06:41.708
now.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.000
Thank you.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.000
You're not Gordon.

06:52.041 --> 06:54.625
Gordon is the new dead to us.
I'm Daniel.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.917
Sit.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.291
Daniel, okay.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.542
- I'd rather stand.
- Sit!

07:03.834 --> 07:05.458
Oh, here.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.208
Okay.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.583
So... a job offer just came in.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.458
Really? What's the job?

07:13.500 --> 07:17.708
- A commercial for Astros Cereal.
- I don't do commercials.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.500
I am so close
to slapping you right now.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.959
But I-- I'm not a sell-out.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.500
- A sell-out?
- Yeah.

07:25.542 --> 07:28.500
I'm sorry, is that some sort of
an older person's term?

07:28.542 --> 07:29.959
I am hearing "sell," which I love.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.250
Have you ever heard
of artistic integrity?

07:32.291 --> 07:35.291
( laughs )

07:40.041 --> 07:41.375
No.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.375
Okay, let me put it this way.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.000
I am the show
in show business.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.959
There is no business
without the show.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.500
And there's no show business
without the business.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.291
Wray? It's Wray.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.667
- Yes, it's Wray.
- Right, right.

07:52.708 --> 07:55.125
And the business is money.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.959
Astros Cereal pays six figures.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.250
I'm not doing it!

07:59.291 --> 08:01.458
- Which six?
- Well--

08:01.500 --> 08:03.583
Don't tell me!

08:03.625 --> 08:05.834
I'm a serious actor.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.250
Serious actors
don't do commercials.

08:07.291 --> 08:08.792
Hmm, right, right.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.500
Except for Matthew McConaughey,
Kevin Spacey,

08:11.542 --> 08:13.125
Samuel L. Jackson,
Benicio Del Toro...

08:13.166 --> 08:14.875
- Oh, God, no.
- Robert Duvall.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.875
- Duvall?
- The Rock sells tires.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.375
- Well--
- Catherine Zeta-Jones,

08:18.417 --> 08:19.834
- God.
- Kevin Bacon,

08:19.875 --> 08:21.750
- Really?
- six different brands for BeyoncГ©.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.834
- Why would she need the money?
- Pacino.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.542
- Clint Eastwood.
- Look, okay, stop, stop.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.875
- Harvey Keitel.
- God, come on!

08:28.917 --> 08:31.458
- Lawrence Olivier.
- When did he do that?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.875
- Dame Judy Dench.
- Not Dame Judy.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.833
- Nicole Kidman.
- Stop talking!

08:35.875 --> 08:38.082
- Rob Lowe!
- They're all sell-outs.

08:38.125 --> 08:42.417
- They're all sell-outs!
- Again, I'm not 100% on that term.

08:42.457 --> 08:44.000
Let me ask you something.

08:44.041 --> 08:47.166
What is your business model?

08:47.208 --> 08:50.792
I don't have a business model.
I am an actor.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.083
I date models.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.375
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

08:55.417 --> 08:59.166
I dated one once, a hand model,
but she was hot all over.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.250
Actually, the least attractive thing

09:01.291 --> 09:04.208
about her was her hand,
her left one.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.583
It was too skinny.
That's the business.

09:07.625 --> 09:11.250
The right one was fat,
and that's why she lost work.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.291
I'm pretty much just waiting

09:13.333 --> 09:15.542
for your mouth to stop moving
so that I can talk.

09:15.583 --> 09:18.917
You work for me.
Am I right?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.250
Well, now,
that's sort of a gray area.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.750
- Actually, it's a--
- No, no, you work for me.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.041
Am I right? ( expletive ).

09:26.083 --> 09:27.667
Technically, yes.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.583
Yes, well, I have something
called artistic integri-- aah!

09:32.208 --> 09:36.208
There is no amount
of artistic integri-aah

09:36.250 --> 09:38.041
to placate our investors, Wray.

09:38.083 --> 09:41.208
Pascal, where's Daniel?

09:41.250 --> 09:44.083
He was fired while you were gone.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.834
I didn't go anywhere.
I just bent down.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.500
These are volatile times.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.792
Wray: Because somebody
keeps firing everyone.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.583
And if I ever find that person,
I will fire them.

09:53.625 --> 09:59.000
- I-- I'm the show.
- Wray!

09:59.041 --> 10:03.083
There is no such thing
as show business anymore.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.875
This is the entertainment industry.

10:06.917 --> 10:09.166
There is no entertainment
without industry

10:09.208 --> 10:11.792
and there is no industry
without machines.

10:11.834 --> 10:15.834
You are simply a minor cog

10:15.875 --> 10:19.375
in a complex machine
of an entertainment industry

10:19.417 --> 10:21.917
that operates in concert
with every other industry,

10:21.959 --> 10:27.458
creating one tremendous
mechanism of profit

10:27.500 --> 10:30.708
and enterprise.

10:30.750 --> 10:35.083
If you are summoned
to help the machine,

10:35.125 --> 10:37.458
you will help the machine.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.125
Um...

10:40.166 --> 10:41.750
I have a body of work.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.959
( chuckles )

10:44.000 --> 10:49.291
If your work had a body,
it would be riddled with disease.

10:49.333 --> 10:53.667
You haven't become a sell-out
because no one is buying!

10:53.708 --> 10:56.959
You're a generic brand
on a forgotten shelf

10:57.000 --> 11:00.875
marked "sci-fi actor, half price."

11:00.917 --> 11:03.625
( mutters )

11:03.667 --> 11:05.792
See, and... whoops.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.875
I'm ready for the next changeover.
Who's your assistant?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.917
- I fired him.
- Wray: That's smart.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.834
- ( buzzing )
- Oh!

11:15.875 --> 11:18.250
- You're fired.
- What?

11:18.291 --> 11:21.458
Yeah, thank God.
Don't say anything else.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.875
Wray, you can't fire me.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.750
- I just did.
- ( Pascal chuckles )

11:26.792 --> 11:28.792
Where will you go?

11:28.834 --> 11:30.750
There are no countries,
no cultures,

11:30.792 --> 11:34.875
just branded peoples
bumbling around,

11:34.917 --> 11:37.959
buying their identities on credit.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.792
( chime )

11:41.834 --> 11:44.500
Woman: I have Russell Crowe
for you on line one.

11:44.542 --> 11:47.667
- Who are you?
- I'm your new assistant.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.208
( expletive ).

11:49.250 --> 11:51.667
I got your text.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.125
So, what's the job?

11:54.166 --> 11:56.208
Am I a doctor-cop-lawyer?

11:56.250 --> 12:00.417
Wray, I can't just give you a job
on the season's hottest TV show.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.000
I mean, I know that. I just--

12:03.041 --> 12:04.375
what's the job?

12:04.417 --> 12:06.291
It's a national commercial.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.583
Wray:
Buddy, I am not a sell-out!

12:08.625 --> 12:11.208
Hey, there's no sell-outs
anymore, buddy.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.417
We don't call 'em that anymore.
We just call 'em people with money.

12:13.458 --> 12:17.667
I just fired my agent for trying
to get me to do a cereal commercial.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Astros Cereal?

12:19.291 --> 12:21.875
- Wray: Yeah.
- Wray, Wray!

12:21.917 --> 12:24.000
I set that up! That was me!

12:24.041 --> 12:25.458
That's the director
for "Doctor Cop Lawyer."

12:25.500 --> 12:26.542
He's shooting that commercial.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.375
Big directors do commercials
all the time.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.708
I knew that, too.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.333
Unfire your agents.
Have them call production.

12:33.375 --> 12:38.708
All right, I will unfire them.
Somehow.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.291
I don't think I can unfire them.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.458
- It's a volatile time.
- Pascal!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.792
- Get your ass in gear! Go!
- Yes, sir.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.208
You know what?
I'm just gonna negotiate it myself.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.917
Jack: Hey, you need someone
to negotiate for you, okay?

12:52.959 --> 12:55.041
I don't care if it's a bookie.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.083
I don't care if it's an arms dealer.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.125
I don't care if it's a hobo
with a cell phone.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.458
- Get anybody.
- Okay, okay.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.625
I think I know the person.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.250
Bye.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.500
- Woman: Hello?
- Bobbie.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.875
Get out of here, come on!
Go, go, go!

13:14.917 --> 13:18.125
- Okay...
- ( yelling indistinctly )

13:18.166 --> 13:21.166
( music playing )

13:23.500 --> 13:25.417
The director of the commercial

13:25.458 --> 13:27.708
is also directing
a prestigious drama.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.792
- "Doctor Cop Lawyer."
- Yes, "Doctor Cop Lawyer"!

13:29.834 --> 13:31.417
You'd be the gimpy sidekick.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.000
I wanted to play the lead.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.041
That part has to be played
by a manly man.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.750
( deep voice )
I can be manly.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.500
He must be such a manly man

13:39.542 --> 13:42.291
that there is another man
inside of him.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.417
I'm sorry, I did not bring
an extra adult diaper.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.291
- You can use mine.
- Action!

13:48.333 --> 13:50.291
Astros gives me ten essential--

13:50.333 --> 13:51.333
Cue the satellite!

13:51.375 --> 13:53.291
- Aah!
- Perfect!
