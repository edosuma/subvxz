00:01.533 --> 00:04.985
So my stepbrother situation Drake works quite well.

00:04.994 --> 00:06.766
Living with Josh is not so bad ..

00:06.768 --> 00:10.288
but he should stop cutting his nails on my bed.

00:11.206 --> 00:15.300
Drake his bed was certainly comfortable. Bye bye, toe-nail.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.067
Anyway, my band doing great ..

00:18.070 --> 00:21.788
we play tonight in a cool place. So I wrote a new song.

00:21.924 --> 00:24.028
It goes a little like this:

00:28.508 --> 00:30.660
It sounds better on guitar.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.535
Drake always rehearses with his band downstairs in the garage.

00:33.827 --> 00:36.301
They are very good, but also very noisy ..

00:36.302 --> 00:39.375
which sometimes makes it difficult to learn, but mostly ..

00:39.378 --> 00:42.111
- I think it's nice to have a new stepbrother

00:42.124 --> 00:45.900
I would just think Josh is looser and we have more fun.

00:47.223 --> 00:51.833
Drake is very smart, but just want to have fun. Fun, fun, fun ..

00:51.893 --> 00:55.222
he will not go to death by some to take more responsibility.

00:55.428 --> 00:58.022
Oh, disgusting! - Oh, disgusting!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

Josh..

01:17.754 --> 01:19.345
Josh!

01:19.507 --> 01:21.612
I'm working on a number here.

01:21.857 --> 01:23.992
Should you make so much noise?

01:27.117 --> 01:29.421
Dude, I can not concentrate.

01:31.571 --> 01:36.474
I CAN NOT HEAR YOU! I wear earplugs!

01:40.682 --> 01:44.288
Dude, you can not build anywhere else you retarded mechanical machine?

01:44.299 --> 01:46.050
It's not a stupid machine.

01:46.060 --> 01:50.060
It is a 1 in 8 working replica of a medieval catapult.

01:50.062 --> 01:52.002
Shower? - Shower ..

01:52.005 --> 01:57.141
When I finish this baby can shoot up to 15 meters.

01:59.655 --> 02:03.166
Impressive. Oh. Hey Hey. Why Do not climb in and ..

02:03.312 --> 02:05.342
you shoot yourself out of my room?

02:06.008 --> 02:09.039
This is my room. - It was my first room.

02:09.044 --> 02:12.364
Good good. Let's make an agreement. We can..

02:12.980 --> 02:15.111
I just wanted to say ..

02:15.212 --> 02:17.240
But I just wanted ..

02:18.451 --> 02:20.954
Headache!

03:17.602 --> 03:21.906
Josh? Josh, put that thing out please. Your father is on the phone in the kitchen.

03:22.309 --> 03:24.103
I hoi.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.507
You look beautiful. - Thank you darling..

03:28.521 --> 03:32.022
We go out to dinner with your father's boss. - No, we're not ..

03:32.035 --> 03:34.905
Mr. Callaway was on the phone. - What happened?

03:35.140 --> 03:40.138
Well, it has been called their nanny and he called us off again.

03:41.023 --> 03:43.692
I never get that promotion.

03:43.798 --> 03:48.242
I'm sorry, honey. - I really wanted to bewilder him with food.

03:48.401 --> 03:53.824
Drake and I can be careful, you know. - What? Watch? What?!

03:54.822 --> 03:59.000
Oh, boy. I appreciate this very! - But my band is playing tonight and ..

03:59.006 --> 04:02.403
I call Mr. Callaway, you do your hair down further.

04:02.491 --> 04:05.041
My hair is done.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.446
I know.

04:07.743 --> 04:09.907
I'm going to call the Callaway family.

04:12.802 --> 04:16.238
Watch? Watch ?!

04:18.740 --> 04:20.829
How could you imagine to go watch volunteer?

04:20.839 --> 04:23.114
Because the dinner is very important to my father ..

04:23.315 --> 04:27.270
he tries to get a promotion. - Yeah, but my band is as important as ..

04:27.273 --> 04:31.206
Your father's dinner. - Hey, it's now your father, you know.

04:31.220 --> 04:34.958
Whatever. - Come on, it's just a little baby. What would it.

04:35.420 --> 04:36.876
I do not know..

04:36.905 --> 04:41.991
I once saw a movie with a baby alligator when he grew up and ate everyone.

04:42.555 --> 04:47.219
Nobody talks about an alligator. - Well, maybe someone should do right ..

04:47.220 --> 04:48.998
Before it's too late.

04:51.022 --> 04:54.699
Drake, Josh. Callaway family is er.

04:54.781 --> 04:58.354
Come on, Drake, let's meet the baby. - I'll be right back.

04:59.090 --> 05:04.833
I will help you until I have gone with the band. Then the baby is your problem.

05:04.843 --> 05:08.866
Grab the tail and beware of the mouth and you'll save.

05:19.033 --> 05:25.205
Look him sleep. It is such a little angel. - Thank you. He should sleep through the night ..

05:25.209 --> 05:28.313
he does not, then you only need this.

05:28.315 --> 05:31.693
Awesome. You see? All we need .. - And this.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.447
Oh, and maybe ..

05:34.658 --> 05:36.286
some of ..

05:37.851 --> 05:39.811
this one.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.818
This is his favorite.

05:43.283 --> 05:48.807
I've been working on the track. The whole day.

05:50.001 --> 05:54.200
Sleep, he always immediately. - Come on, darling. I think the guys can do it.

05:54.208 --> 05:57.371
Of course we can. -Jahoor, you can go.

05:57.773 --> 05:59.508
Based in.

06:03.160 --> 06:09.900
Promise me to give extra attention to little Max. - Do not worry, we have it under control.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.710
Well, goodbye.

06:13.713 --> 06:16.964
Wait! Where are you going? You had to help said.

06:17.099 --> 06:20.470
Help with what? He seems to sleep. - What if he wakes up?

06:20.472 --> 06:23.804
She said he continues to sleep through the night. You'll be fine.

06:26.924 --> 06:28.831
Please, will you.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.530
Answer it! - He is stuck!

06:34.531 --> 06:36.750
Pull it. - I don already there!

06:36.753 --> 06:39.012
Trek. - I don already there.

06:39.758 --> 06:41.530
Pull! Pull harder!

06:54.105 --> 06:57.988
Oh, baby! - Oh, the fish!

07:03.256 --> 07:05.162
Come on.

07:25.434 --> 07:27.298
Give .. Give me that.

08:14.225 --> 08:18.000
Drake, we have about two hours. - Can we at least have a moment to rehearse?

08:18.006 --> 08:21.114
Hear you not? - We can not stop it.

08:21.301 --> 08:27.287
Maybe his diaper, you know, filled? - Of this I have always cry.

08:27.478 --> 08:30.246
Drake, check the diaper. - Oh yeah, like that's going to happen.

08:30.248 --> 08:34.981
Come on, just take a look and tell if you have found some "stuff".

08:36.034 --> 08:39.062
I will not watch it. - Smell then on.

08:39.107 --> 08:42.039
I'm not smelling baby-butt.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.477
I want to smell it!

08:45.766 --> 08:47.631
Go for it.

08:54.502 --> 08:56.658
Well? - Not bad.

08:57.408 --> 08:58.988
Really?

09:01.059 --> 09:03.668
That's the dirtiest thing I've ever smelled.

09:05.364 --> 09:09.097
Which! You smell.

09:09.685 --> 09:13.237
Ah, come on. it may be how bad?

09:15.151 --> 09:18.855
Josh..
Josh?

09:30.858 --> 09:35.431
So, so, so. He's ready. All we need now is a lazy ..

09:42.300 --> 09:45.978
Grab something! The diapers!

09:50.729 --> 09:54.723
This is wet! Give me another.

09:55.656 --> 09:59.007
I think that was the last. - Good is that ..

09:59.010 --> 10:02.685
we have a naked baby and no diapers. What do we do?

10:12.344 --> 10:17.237
And this was it. - That baby could not look stupid.

10:17.286 --> 10:20.180
You have offended him. Look what you've done.

10:20.182 --> 10:22.580
Make it stop. - How?

10:22.584 --> 10:25.277
The bear! Where is the one singing bear that makes him sleep?

10:25.277 --> 10:28.352
I do not know .. Look there.

10:30.438 --> 10:31.811
I got him.

10:32.539 --> 10:34.821
I've been working on it ..

10:35.628 --> 10:37.985
Come on, wind it up again.

10:44.578 --> 10:47.778
I told him wind up, not breaking his head.

10:48.654 --> 10:51.220
What are we going to do now?

10:52.487 --> 11:01.517
I've been working on the track. Just to pass the time ..

11:01.813 --> 11:11.204
Can not you hear the whistle flute. Driving so early in the morning ..

11:11.500 --> 11:20.323
Can not you hear the captain calling: Diana, blows the horn.

11:20.324 --> 11:25.052
I said Diana would not blow. Diana would not blow ..

11:25.173 --> 11:29.460
Diana would not blow the horn.

11:31.847 --> 11:38.391
Diana, blows the horn.

11:41.020 --> 11:44.092
Finally. - Yes. Okay..

11:44.095 --> 11:46.306
I continue with my slingshot.

11:46.779 --> 11:50.996
Oh, that's Scottie. I gotta get to act. - Wait, Drake!

11:51.106 --> 11:54.107
You can not leave me here alone with the baby.

11:54.110 --> 11:58.450
You'll save it, he sleeps. And imagine never again to adjust voluntarily.

11:58.465 --> 12:03.484
What if he starts to cry? I can not play guitar.

12:03.965 --> 12:06.372
You think of something. Later on.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.274
Drake, wait. I..

12:10.910 --> 12:12.694
you need.

12:14.208 --> 12:21.980
Okay, okay. He is right. I can do this. Everything .. Everything is under control.

12:21.981 --> 12:26.463
The crying stopped. My catapult is almost finished.

12:26.559 --> 12:29.056
The baby's gone ..

12:30.007 --> 12:32.982
BABY'S WAY!

12:42.808 --> 12:45.911
Here. Baby, baby, baby.

12:46.004 --> 12:49.414
Here. Max. Where are you?

12:52.115 --> 12:54.906
Oh, this is not good ..

12:54.910 --> 12:58.339
wait! I hear crying ..

12:58.401 --> 13:02.256
Oh, that's me ..

13:04.589 --> 13:07.278
Oh, I check the garage.

13:07.502 --> 13:11.709
Here. Baby, baby. Max, you sit here?

13:12.764 --> 13:19.452
Ooh, how I'll ever find him? Oh, I know: Marco!

13:21.187 --> 13:23.892
Framework!

13:24.818 --> 13:29.662
Come on, Max. You know how this works. Say Polo.

13:31.599 --> 13:35.788
What am I supposed to think? Babies can not swim.

13:37.312 --> 13:40.513
I need help. I have to call Drake.

13:47.664 --> 13:50.380
Your band has about 20 minutes. - Cool, thanks.

13:50.389 --> 13:53.441
Cool, man. Thanks. I'm already set up. - Good.

13:55.007 --> 14:00.189
Drake? Why do you smell like a dirty diaper?

14:00.190 --> 14:05.153
Because I'm a changed. Not like you that just left us alone.

14:05.155 --> 14:11.017
- Oh, like you, Josh have only allowed to be here?

14:11.028 --> 14:16.599
That is something completely different because he's the one .. I did not ..

14:16.600 --> 14:19.488
With you .. and I have been silent.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.516
Drake! Take, take, take on ..

14:25.625 --> 14:27.396
Answer now please ..

14:27.399 --> 14:30.711
Hey, Parker .. - Hey Drak .. Ooh, with voicemail.

14:32.111 --> 14:35.406
Drake, I can not this really just wondering ..

14:35.471 --> 14:40.013
I run on the house, the baby is, not Polo.

14:40.712 --> 14:43.130
And I think maybe ..

14:44.024 --> 14:48.317
What was that? Drake, call me!

14:52.232 --> 14:53.979
Baby!

14:58.915 --> 15:01.539
It was only my slingshot.

15:02.407 --> 15:06.179
With the baby's diaper curtain on it.

15:10.316 --> 15:13.907
No. No no no no.

15:13.910 --> 15:17.757
My catapult never be a baby from being thrown.

15:18.791 --> 15:20.814
No, never.

15:25.646 --> 15:30.355
NO!

15:32.502 --> 15:35.820
I shot off the baby!

15:38.444 --> 15:41.370
Hi Drake. - We can not wait for you guys to play.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.743
Really? - Sure, your band rocks.

15:44.203 --> 15:47.196
Well, we all do it for the fans.

15:47.304 --> 15:50.566
So, what do you do after the show?

15:51.649 --> 15:55.965
you also smell .. Dirty diapers?

15:56.580 --> 16:00.594
Oh, yes, yes. That's our guitarist, Paul.

16:01.834 --> 16:05.068
He has "glitches". - Ie.

16:05.815 --> 16:07.596
Hell yes.

16:09.275 --> 16:12.024
Where are you now, Max?

16:12.407 --> 16:16.983
Oh, the rubybal has landed on the roof. I wonder where ..

16:17.160 --> 16:20.565
BABY IS ON THE ROOF!

16:22.631 --> 16:25.809
Drake! You will not believe it, but the baby ..

16:26.323 --> 16:29.529
is fine, Mrs. Callaway.

16:29.581 --> 16:34.756
Uh, yes, ma'am. Max .. right .. here.

16:35.798 --> 16:38.839
You want to talk to him?

16:38.865 --> 16:41.992
He's just working on something. Can I take a message?

16:42.449 --> 16:47.458
No? Okay. H-Here he comes.

16:52.989 --> 16:59.480
He sounds so happy. Hello little Maxie. Hai.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.395
Mom. - He said mama!

17:02.400 --> 17:06.935
That's his first word! Oh, Max, say it again?

17:06.941 --> 17:09.181
Mother!

17:09.973 --> 17:15.900
Oh, Max. I'm so excited. Let's go. I should be there for this.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.640
Pak m'n handtas, Bob.

17:20.002 --> 17:22.397
PAK m'n HANDTAS, BOB!

17:30.005 --> 17:32.755
Hey, I have a voice message, please wait. - See you on stage.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.483
Drake, I can not this really just wondering ..

17:36.495 --> 17:40.740
I run on the house, the baby is, not Polo.

17:40.757 --> 17:44.720
Drake, your band is as follows. - Yes man. Come on in.

17:44.721 --> 17:47.123
Well, I'll be right there.

17:48.061 --> 17:50.078
Drake, call me!

18:03.305 --> 18:05.749
Hang on, Max!

18:07.800 --> 18:11.790
Stay on the roof, Uncle Josh is coming to save you.

18:18.665 --> 18:24.170
Okay, okay. This could be worse .. Naah, it can not be.

18:24.179 --> 18:29.359
No baby. No ladder. No luck.

18:31.827 --> 18:35.258
So, bit by hanging?

18:36.058 --> 18:40.660
Drake! You came back! - Yes, my performance was canceled.

18:40.669 --> 18:46.514
Can you tell me how to get there? - It's a long, sad story.

18:46.887 --> 18:51.122
Can you reset the ladder? - Okay.

18:52.315 --> 18:58.075
Hey, where's the baby? - Possible .. On the roof.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.812
You put the baby on the roof ?! - No ..

19:02.189 --> 19:08.501
it is conceivable that the baby had been shot down there. The, uh, catapult.

19:08.542 --> 19:14.500
Oh, Drake. I made a mess of it. The baby is missing. The house was destroyed ..

19:14.502 --> 19:18.178
and my father is fired. - Hey, where's Megan?

19:18.207 --> 19:23.417
I do not know. I .. I have not seen her since the baby's gone.

19:25.318 --> 19:28.266
I have a suspicion that the baby.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.714
Okay. Im coming down.

19:34.732 --> 19:37.489
Oh, come on!

19:41.133 --> 19:45.855
Well, where is he? - I think he's hanging from the gutter.

19:46.233 --> 19:49.383
Not Josh, baby.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.986
Why do you think I have the baby?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.037
Because you're a twisted devil girl.

19:57.401 --> 19:59.878
Oh, thank you, Drake.

20:01.874 --> 20:04.956
Where's the baby?

20:08.230 --> 20:11.972
I deserve this. This is all because my ..

20:12.044 --> 20:14.931
Turtle "Sheldon" forgot to enter kindergarten.

20:15.052 --> 20:18.757
He's gone to heaven, and now my life is bad.

20:19.363 --> 20:24.955
Are you happy now, Sheldon? We are now equal.

20:26.202 --> 20:28.525
Josh?
Sheldon?!

20:29.614 --> 20:34.355
Josh, what are you doing up there? - Oh, you are.

20:34.427 --> 20:37.916
You know .. Just make the gutters baby proof.

20:37.924 --> 20:40.480
Come down. - Right now!

20:40.492 --> 20:43.178
Okay, catch me.

20:48.030 --> 20:50.934
Walter? - Yes sir?

20:50.948 --> 20:53.408
Your son is with me.

20:53.412 --> 20:55.814
I'm sorry sir.

20:56.248 --> 20:57.546
Come feet.

21:02.293 --> 21:05.060
Well, Josh. What is going on?

21:05.063 --> 21:08.950
Who is minding Max? - Uh, Drake is inside.

21:08.955 --> 21:11.387
I'm going to look at the baby.

21:12.122 --> 21:14.308
No! I mean..

21:14.310 --> 21:20.251
it is such a beautiful evening. You would .. A piece can walk! Or..

21:20.444 --> 21:22.283
a vacation.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.996
I go inside to hear Max "mama" says.

21:37.058 --> 21:42.080
Okay, look, look, I can explain. There is the following happened: I ..

21:42.081 --> 21:47.435
Diana, blows the horn.

21:48.661 --> 21:51.298
Oh, good evening everyone.

21:52.079 --> 21:57.429
Hi baby. Say "mama". Say "mama".

21:59.526 --> 22:02.295
How? - What, what?

22:02.296 --> 22:06.067
The baby's back. The house is perfect.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.608
Dad's boss is happy .. - Say "mama".

22:09.788 --> 22:12.872
Zeg "mama".

22:12.880 --> 22:15.654
Did he behave? - No problems.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.786
As if he was not even here.

22:18.268 --> 22:21.495
Well, we still need a ride. Thanks for dinner.

22:21.500 --> 22:25.962
No, thank you, Bob. - Call me Mr. Callaway, please.

22:29.367 --> 22:33.887
Come on, say "mama". Say "mama"!

22:36.869 --> 22:42.373
Megan, you've helped the boys with the baby? - I certainly, Mom.

22:43.648 --> 22:46.075
That's my girl. Okay, now go to bed.

22:50.436 --> 22:54.471
Thanks, guys. Tonight meant a lot to me.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.910
You love it too good to me. - No problem.

22:57.957 --> 22:59.708
Glad to help.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.289
Okay, you also likes one of my credit. Where did you find the baby?

23:05.454 --> 23:10.130
In the same place we found your diary, itching powder and stink bombs.

23:10.134 --> 23:13.292
Megan. - Jup.

23:14.329 --> 23:16.977
So, why was your performance actually canceled?

23:17.081 --> 23:20.875
Oh, you know. The club was booked and so we decided to take the band ..

23:20.955 --> 23:26.116
No, you're beaten on the action and have come here to save me.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.790
Because you love me.

23:29.643 --> 23:33.106
Well, I knew it was an important evening.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.031
Yes, it meant a lot to my father.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.816
Hey, it's now my father.

23:38.838 --> 23:43.572
Uh, guys? Why smell the curtains in the kitchen to pee?

23:51.247 --> 23:54.831
We should pity him. - I do not know how to change a diaper.

23:54.932 --> 24:00.096
Oh, Rena. You're a girl, you spare them. - Okay, obviously. Yes. Umm ..

24:01.653 --> 24:03.475
just hold on.

24:13.378 --> 24:15.778
We see no return.
