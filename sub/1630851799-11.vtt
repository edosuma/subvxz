WEBVTT

00:02.433 --> 00:03.367
- Previously
on the "Real Housewives

00:04.133 --> 00:05.533
of Beverly Hills"...

00:05.567 --> 00:08.166
- We want to finally do
our girls' trip to La Quinta.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.500
- I may have
to call Naomi Campbell

00:09.533 --> 00:11.133
and get her HAZMAT suit.

00:11.166 --> 00:13.200
-
Yeah, exactly.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.100
- Do they have a man here
that can help?

00:15.133 --> 00:17.033
Some of it's heavy.
- I don't have help here.

00:17.066 --> 00:18.400
Did you bring a house man?

00:18.433 --> 00:23.100
- Something broke today
about her and Tom being sued.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.300
- Wow, this is on "Fox News."

00:27.333 --> 00:28.467
- It's everywhere.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.133
- I ask myself,
what else is coming?

00:31.166 --> 00:32.500
- Do you have any idea?
- None.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.467
It's not just Tom
going down with the ship.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.266
He's taking us all down
with it.

00:36.300 --> 00:40.300
- I'm sorry.
- Kyle, this is so hard to do.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.667
This is so hard.
What's happening is so hard.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.100
- Do we know how it went
with Tom today?

00:45.133 --> 00:47.133
- The government froze
all of his assets

00:47.166 --> 00:51.266
because at least $2 million
was used inappropriately.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.400
- He was cheating on you.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.400
- The divorce, the affairs.

00:55.433 --> 00:58.467
I mean, how do you process
all of this?

00:58.500 --> 01:00.200
- This is my life.

01:22.467 --> 01:25.533
Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.533
- I see dirty dishes.

01:29.567 --> 01:33.100
- You know what, I'm trying
to just look beyond right now.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.333
Look beyond the dirty dishes.
- Okay, yes.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.467
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Good morning.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.667
- Ugh, this house.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.233
- We need
to have somebody come.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.133
- They're coming.
- Oh, my God.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.233
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dorit.

01:44.266 --> 01:45.433
- I need coffee so bad.

01:45.467 --> 01:48.100
Do you not feel sick?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.166
I have a wee little bit
of a headache.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.233
After Erika left last night,
there was heavy conversation.

01:54.266 --> 01:55.567
- You guys have fun.
Enjoy.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.500
- See you tomorrow.
Have a nice time at the hotel.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.700
- You guys, the stress
this must be causing her.

02:01.734 --> 02:05.233
- Look what she's lived with
and what she's held inside.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.166
- It reminds me
of the Madoff thing.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.433
Like, what is
actually happening?

02:14.300 --> 02:17.266
- Why? I don't know why
it turned into a dance party.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.567
Because we like to have fun!

02:21.500 --> 02:24.133
- Go, Doogie, go!

02:24.166 --> 02:26.633
Whoo!
-

02:26.667 --> 02:29.400
- By the way--ah!

02:29.433 --> 02:31.400
Okay, I want to sit down
and have my coffee

02:31.433 --> 02:33.233
so I can feel
like a human being,

02:33.266 --> 02:35.633
'cause I am not
quite a human yet.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.400
- Did you drink a lot
last night?

02:37.433 --> 02:38.467
- What is this?

02:38.500 --> 02:40.333
- What?
- Wait, what?

02:40.367 --> 02:42.100
- What? What? What?
What's happening?

02:42.133 --> 02:44.633
- Is Tom in the hospital?
- What does it say?

02:44.667 --> 02:48.600
- It says "hospitalized
for serious illness."

02:48.633 --> 02:51.166
- What?

02:51.200 --> 02:53.667
- Right now, he's hospitalized?
- No. Wait, hold on.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.734
- Saying that
Tom was hospitalized.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.333
But we're trying to figure out
if it was or he is.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.333
I think--it said he was,
but I don't think he is now.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.433
- He was hospitalized, it said?
He was?

03:02.467 --> 03:05.166
- His attorneys are coming out
and saying this right now.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
They're saying that he suffered
a serious illness

03:07.233 --> 03:10.233
in recent months for which
he needed to be hospitalized,

03:10.266 --> 03:13.367
meaning he was, but not now.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.567
- There's so much stuff
she can't talk about.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.367
- There's a lot going on. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.600
This has got--
it's, like, never-ending.

03:22.633 --> 03:25.533
- No, he's--it's over for him.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.667
- Every day,
there is a new story.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.500
New allegations.
-

03:31.533 --> 03:34.000
- Every day,
she's dealing with this.

03:34.033 --> 03:35.500
- Morning!
Good morning.

03:35.533 --> 03:37.533
- Hi.
- How are you guys?

03:37.567 --> 03:39.500
How'd you guys sleep?
- Slept well, a little tired.

03:39.533 --> 03:40.734
- I slept good, actually.
- Oh, good.

03:40.767 --> 03:42.233
- Those are cute pants.
- Thanks.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.433
- Very cute.
- So what's the plan?

03:43.467 --> 03:45.600
- The plan is--
well, I have electric bikes,

03:45.633 --> 03:47.734
if you guys want to--
whoever wants to go for a ride.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.266
- I'll do it.
- I'll go.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.300
- Yeah, I might be
a little scared.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.533
I'm accident-prone.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.266
I really like feet
on the ground.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.300
I'm a feet-on-the-ground
kind of girl.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.767
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- Yeah, same.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.166
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:04.300 --> 04:07.000
- Hi, guys.
- Good morning.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.433
- How's it going, y'all?
- You look cute.

04:09.467 --> 04:12.200
How was your bed?
- The bed is actually soft.

04:12.233 --> 04:14.633
But I couldn't go to sleep.
I'm hungry.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.433
- There's muffins out there.

04:16.467 --> 04:19.233
- Good morning, Erika!
Did you sleep at all?

04:19.266 --> 04:21.567
A little bit. Okay.
- A little bit.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.433
Last night was really intense.

04:25.467 --> 04:27.567
- All right.
I'm gonna hug you anyway.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.300
- And with the lawsuits
and hearings

04:35.333 --> 04:38.000
and everything else
that's happening around me,

04:38.033 --> 04:39.700
there's a lot of anxiety
right now.

04:39.734 --> 04:42.600
- Here's our biking queen.
- Hi.

04:42.633 --> 04:44.266
Are you coming biking, honey?

04:44.300 --> 04:46.200
- I'm kind of tired,
so I'll stay back.

04:46.233 --> 04:48.600
- I know Erika holds things
close to her chest,

04:48.633 --> 04:51.333
but I don't think it hit me
that she really was

04:51.367 --> 04:53.500
going through such a hard time
until last night.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.400
I hated when I read
his legal team

04:56.433 --> 05:00.500
asked the court to not allow
you to have spousal support.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.467
- Yeah.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.734
- I don't begrudge Erika

05:03.767 --> 05:06.767
for not sharing
how bad her life was.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.667
But sometimes you wonder,
why doesn't she trust me?

05:10.700 --> 05:13.033
Why doesn't she feel
comfortable opening up

05:13.066 --> 05:14.367
about her struggles?

05:14.400 --> 05:15.600
- You guys,
go have a good time.

05:15.633 --> 05:17.500
I'm fine.
- Come on, my loves.

05:17.533 --> 05:19.066
Are we going? All right.
- Yeah. Let's go.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.300
- Okay, bye, guys.
- Bye, guys.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.467
- Bye.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
Oh, wow.
- Oh.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.500
- Let's do this.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.700
- Ready?
- On your mark. Get set.

05:26.734 --> 05:27.734
Go!

05:27.767 --> 05:29.667
- Go, guys. Go!

05:29.700 --> 05:32.567
- Whoo!
- Whoo--oh, my God.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.500
Watch out. Ahh!
- Sh--.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.767
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.100
Don't get hit by a car.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.767
Wow, they go fast!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.500
- Good morning, glory.
- Hi. What's wrong?

05:41.533 --> 05:43.367
- I didn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.600
It was so boiling.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.667
She had it at 76.
- 76? Jeez.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.100
- Oh, I had my--
- Mine's at 68.

05:49.133 --> 05:50.734
- I had my fan going
and the door open,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.633
'cause I like it cold.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.633
I'm gonna get dressed
and be back down.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.000
- I'm gonna try to
close my eyes for a little bit.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.500
- Oh.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.000
- Look how cute this is.

06:01.033 --> 06:03.400
I can't believe
we did not know this was here.

06:03.433 --> 06:04.633
- I got off
on the wrong side, oops.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.500
- Kyle, you didn't tell me
there were shops here.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.033
- Isn't this adorable,
you guys?

06:09.066 --> 06:10.667
- So cute. I love this.
- Yes!

06:10.700 --> 06:12.533
- Let's get a crepe.
- Yes.

06:12.567 --> 06:15.066
- I would like
a cold brew iced coffee.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.767
- Do you have, like,
jalapeños or anything?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.533
- Can't decide between a
pumpkin spice or a chai latte.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.400
- I mean, I want everything.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.066
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.300
Thank you.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.567
- I love this cute
little furniture.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.300
- I know.
Kathy's calling.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.700
I need to answer Kathy.
Hi.

06:30.734 --> 06:32.333
- Hi. Do you have a straw,

06:32.367 --> 06:34.300
by any chance, here,
for my shake?

06:34.333 --> 06:36.667
- What? A straw?
- We'll bring one back.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.400
- I need a straw
for the shake.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.133
- For the shake.
Oh, she's got her shakes

06:40.166 --> 06:42.333
that she drinks in the morning.
- I don't think I have a straw.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.300
- Can you bring me
a straw and chia seeds?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.400
- I'll go get her--
and chia seeds?

06:46.433 --> 06:49.133
- No, I can't get chia seeds!
I can get you a straw.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.333
- I need them.
- Oh, she is funny.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.433
- Kathy.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.066
I will get you a straw.
- Chia seeds and a straw.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.467
Please. That's it.
That's all I ask.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.767
- I'm on a bike.
I'm not in a car.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.567
- Okay, but if anybody has
a straw or chia seeds,

07:01.600 --> 07:02.767
I would really love it.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.500
- Let me look in my purse.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.433
Okay. Love you. Bye.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.533
- Does she have somebody
at home

07:07.567 --> 07:09.033
that takes care of her, like--

07:09.066 --> 07:10.300
she always has,
like, a guy too.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.400
- Well, don't forget
she's someone that also used

07:12.433 --> 07:14.033
to live in the Waldorf Astoria.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.700
Call down and have everything
sent right to her home.

07:15.734 --> 07:17.433
I think she runs
like a hotel too.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.033
- Yeah. Well, why wouldn't you?

07:19.066 --> 07:20.433
- I mean,
your last name's Hilton.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.433
- I think--I think
we're all just jealous.

07:22.467 --> 07:23.633
- We are jealous!

07:23.667 --> 07:25.567
I, for sure, am jealous!

07:25.600 --> 07:28.433
- If we could sum up,
we just want Kathy's life.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.033
- I like being self-sufficient.

07:31.066 --> 07:33.467
- If you don't need
to be self-sufficient,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
why wouldn't you just be Kathy?

07:37.567 --> 07:41.567
- God, I felt--I just can't
stop thinking about Erika

07:41.600 --> 07:43.166
and that conversation
last night.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.767
- Oh, I know.
I know.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.066
- Guys, can you imagine being
married to someone who's 81

07:48.100 --> 07:50.600
and--and he's
been cheating on you?

07:50.633 --> 07:52.066
- Well, I don't even think
that the age

07:52.100 --> 07:53.233
has anything to do with it.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.600
I mean, just the fact
that he would do it

07:55.633 --> 07:58.433
and then be so mean to her.

07:58.467 --> 08:01.200
She worked really hard to try
and paint a different picture.

08:01.233 --> 08:02.600
- Of course. Yeah.

08:02.633 --> 08:05.467
- And yet she still thinks
about protecting him.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.667
- I know.
- Yep.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.600
- I really hope that
someone is advising her,

08:09.633 --> 08:12.066
someone's telling her, like,
"Erika, he's not gonna

08:12.100 --> 08:13.600
protect you now,
so think about yourself."

08:13.633 --> 08:15.100
- No, I think he's gonna do
the opposite.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.066
I actually think he's
gonna try to take her down.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.033
- Well, when he said,
"You pay the lawyer bills,"

08:19.066 --> 08:20.767
that was an extra--
- Not even the lawyer bills.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.400
- Well, but no spousal support.

08:23.433 --> 08:24.633
- He asked the court
to terminate--

08:24.667 --> 08:26.667
- You guys,
she's not getting a penny.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.433
- I don't think
there's a penny to get.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.734
- Well, that's
what I think it is.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.734
- That's the problem.
- I think there's no money.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.100
- Coming up...

08:38.133 --> 08:40.533
- With any of the lawsuits,
did you have a heads-up?

08:40.567 --> 08:42.100
Is that why you got divorced?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.467
- That was fun.
- That was fun. Ah!

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
- I love it so much.
- I could do this every day.

08:58.533 --> 09:00.633
- So we'll meet back up?
Yeah.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.567
- We're playing croquet
a little later.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.033
- Okay.
- Bye, girls!

09:04.066 --> 09:05.300
- Oh, are you going back
to the hotel?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.100
- Yeah, I'm gonna chill.
- Oh, okay.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.467
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, so I'll see you

09:08.500 --> 09:09.734
at croquet.
- Okay.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.667
- I'm gonna go get myself
ready for croquet.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.567
- Who wants to decorate
the Christmas tree?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.133
Where is everybody?

09:15.166 --> 09:17.166
- Well, yeah, that was been
my question for hours now.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.567
- What do you mean?
Where's Erika?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.033
- Asleep.

09:20.066 --> 09:21.667
- Wait, Dorit, do you want
to run this to Kathy?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.133
- Yes.
- She asked for straws?

09:23.166 --> 09:25.000
- She asked for a straw
and chia seeds. Don't ask.

09:25.033 --> 09:26.266
- And no, we didn't get
the chia seeds.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.100
- I got to put these ornaments
on the tree.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.734
- Oh.
We're decorating the tree?

09:29.767 --> 09:31.200
Is that what's happening
right now?

09:31.233 --> 09:33.200
- Yeah.

09:33.233 --> 09:34.633
Oh, hi.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.700
- Are you decorating the tree?
- We're decorating the tree.

09:37.734 --> 09:39.200
So we're gonna play
a little croquet,

09:39.233 --> 09:41.033
and then tonight
we're gonna have dinner.

09:41.066 --> 09:42.233
- At my place.
- Yay!

09:42.266 --> 09:44.066
- It's so pretty over there.
- Oh, good.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.166
Now, Erika.
- Yeah?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.633
- You have a house here.
- Yeah.

09:47.667 --> 09:50.133
- Where is it--
- Tom does. Yeah, Tom does.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.734
- Where is it?
- I've never--

09:51.767 --> 09:54.200
I don't know
what this address is,

09:54.233 --> 09:55.266
but it's here.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.166
I have a few houses
I don't go to.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.033
And one of them,
I'm a neighbor to Kyle.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.266
- That's right!
- Oh, funny.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.066
- You know that, right?
I've never been in it.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.734
- Your name is
on the homeowner directory?

10:04.767 --> 10:06.000
- Can I see that?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.200
- Yeah, let me see
if I can find it.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.200
- Find the homeowners thing.
I'd like to know.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.133
- Oh, hi. You're awake.
- Yeah.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.033
- We're on a scavenger hunt,
looking for a house.

10:13.066 --> 10:14.767
- Oh, I just--let me
have some coffee first.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
- I'm looking on the app
for the homeowners here.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.133
Let me see if I have it here.
Hold on. Hold on.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.233
There you are.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.000
But our addresses
are not there,

10:22.033 --> 10:23.767
just our phone numbers
and emails.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.100
- See, I'd always been told
that we have a house here,

10:27.133 --> 10:28.600
but I still don't have

10:28.633 --> 10:30.633
any addresses
to where this house is.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.700
- Have you ever been to it?
- No.

10:32.734 --> 10:33.767
- How do you own a home

10:34.000 --> 10:35.667
that you don't know
the address to

10:35.700 --> 10:37.100
and you've never been there?

10:37.133 --> 10:38.333
- No, I asked.

10:38.367 --> 10:42.033
I asked about the home
or property in La Quinta,

10:42.066 --> 10:43.266
and I never got
a straight answer.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.233
- There's stuff
that gets bought

10:45.266 --> 10:47.100
and you don't know sometimes.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.667
It wasn't until I got divorced
that I found out

10:49.700 --> 10:53.100
I was partial owner in two
minor league baseball teams,

10:53.133 --> 10:55.000
so I get real into this.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.233
- I do know
he doesn't spend time--

10:56.266 --> 10:57.700
I mean,
I've never seen Tom here.

10:57.734 --> 11:00.600
- Yeah, but somebody has
to be in this house.

11:00.633 --> 11:01.767
- Oh!

11:02.000 --> 11:03.233
- What, is the house
gonna sit closed?

11:03.266 --> 11:05.000
- Can you imagine?

11:05.033 --> 11:06.600
Okay, I'm not gonna tell you
what just went through my head.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.300
- What, there's a whole
nother family down here?

11:08.333 --> 11:10.133
- Oh, Lord, mercy.
- Oh, goddamn.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.400
- I've already thought
of all of it.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.333
- A woman.
- Yeah. I thought of all of it.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.734
But then again, what do I know?

11:14.767 --> 11:17.133
I don't ----ing know
where my house is.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.000
- Well, just say, "I need
security to open up my house.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.133
"I haven't been here
in a while,

11:21.166 --> 11:23.100
"and I forgot where it is.

11:23.133 --> 11:27.033
"I travel, and I have homes
all over, and I get confused.

11:27.066 --> 11:30.100
In fact, I just remembered that
we have a place down here."

11:30.133 --> 11:32.033
- "I've been in a hotel
like a damn fool!"

11:32.066 --> 11:33.266
- Yeah, "I'm really mixed up."

11:33.300 --> 11:34.667
- It wouldn't work
if I called,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.667
but I bet if Kathy Hilton
called, it would work,

11:36.700 --> 11:38.333
so I think that
she should pretend to be me,

11:38.367 --> 11:40.667
and she'd probably get the
answer in, like, five minutes.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.734
"You know, I travel a lot,
and I forgot the address."

11:42.767 --> 11:44.266
- You know?

11:46.066 --> 11:48.266
- Okay, I just sent a text
to the general manager

11:48.300 --> 11:49.700
to give us the address.

11:49.734 --> 11:51.233
Huh, well, let's see
if he responds.

11:51.266 --> 11:52.333
- Let's see.

11:52.367 --> 11:54.033
- Did you see
what it said today about

11:54.066 --> 11:55.133
how he was hospitalized?

11:55.166 --> 11:56.667
- Yeah, I don't even know
what that is.

11:56.700 --> 11:59.100
- They're saying
that he was hospitalized

11:59.133 --> 12:00.300
because he was sick,

12:00.333 --> 12:02.667
so that's why he didn't know
what he was doing

12:02.700 --> 12:06.300
and didn't pay those people,
I think is what it was saying.

12:06.333 --> 12:09.266
I think it's the lawyers
stating that.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
- I don't know what that is.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.600
I don't know
where it comes from.

12:11.633 --> 12:12.767
I read it this morning, though.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.300
- Your mind must be
just racing right now.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.700
- Yeah.
But it's good that you're here.

12:16.734 --> 12:19.734
- Okay. So let's--
let's get ready for croquet.

12:19.767 --> 12:20.734
- I'm ready.

12:20.767 --> 12:22.066
- Crystal's gonna
meet us there.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.767
- I'm gonna finish this.
- Okay.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.433
- And I'll meet you there.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.200
- Yeah. Okay.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.367
Let's go, guys.
Kathy's gonna meet us there.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.000
- Let's go!
- Okay. Let's go.

12:31.033 --> 12:33.133
Let's do it.
♪ Let's do this ♪

12:40.767 --> 12:42.433
- Rinna, you grew up
playing croquet.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.133
You gonna help me set this up?

12:44.166 --> 12:46.166
I don't have people
for this, guys.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.300
- Siri, can you pull up
a croquet diagram for me?

12:48.333 --> 12:50.233
- You're asking Siri?
- Yeah.

12:50.266 --> 12:51.433
- Oh, my God.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.734
- I don't remember
the rules of croquet at all.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.000
- The object of the game
is to race your opponent

12:56.033 --> 12:57.300
around the course of wickets

12:57.333 --> 12:59.400
and hit the finishing stick
before your opponent.

12:59.433 --> 13:03.200
- I just remember we had this
patch of lawn in our backyard,

13:03.233 --> 13:06.300
and, for some reason,
we would play croquet.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.367
Until we got a pool,
and we ripped out the grass,

13:09.400 --> 13:11.100
and we never
played croquet again.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.700
You're gonna come over here
and have to hit through here,

13:13.734 --> 13:15.367
which doesn't really make
a whole lot of sense.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.734
No, you have to wait a turn.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.467
- So we gotta go here
and then aim that way.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.734
- Yeah.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.166
- With the stick in the way
like that?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.233
That doesn't make any sense.

13:22.266 --> 13:24.166
- I think that people
have this idea

13:24.200 --> 13:26.233
that if people are
somewhat successful

13:26.266 --> 13:27.467
and live
in a nice neighborhood

13:27.500 --> 13:29.100
that they play croquet.

13:29.133 --> 13:31.233
- I have no fricking idea
how to play croquet.

13:31.266 --> 13:33.166
I've never done that
in my entire life.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.767
croquet player.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.100
- I still don't know
how to play.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.100
- I have no idea.
- Aw, sh--!

13:39.133 --> 13:42.033
- But I feel like just
getting out and doing something

13:42.066 --> 13:44.066
is a good distraction
for Erika.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.233
- Oh, sh--.

13:46.266 --> 13:49.100
- Oh, look at Crystal!
- off, Crystal.

13:49.133 --> 13:50.467
- I've never
played this before.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.400
- Wasn't this supposed
to get me out of feeling bad?

13:52.433 --> 13:55.133
I feel worse.
I just feel worse.

13:55.166 --> 13:58.233
This was supposed to help me
feel good. I feel worse.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.367
- Come on, Rinna!

13:59.400 --> 14:02.233
- This is our version
of croquet.

14:02.266 --> 14:04.400
I think we were supposed
to be counting our strokes.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.400
- Hey! Oh, my God!

14:06.433 --> 14:07.734
Wait! That's what you do?

14:07.767 --> 14:10.133
- Destroy the croquet!

14:10.166 --> 14:11.266
Destroy it!

14:14.433 --> 14:16.333
Winner! Kyle buys dinner.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.200
- Lookit, there's Kathy
right there.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.433
- Oh, my God.
You missed the croquet.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.533
- Hi, honey.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.000
- You missed
an exhilarating game.

14:24.033 --> 14:25.400
- Are we playing
"Duck, Duck, Goose"?

14:25.433 --> 14:26.533
- No.
- Yes.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.300
- Got here just in time.
- Just in time.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.500
- Yeah, you missed
all the excitement.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.433
- Did you get the straws
I left under your door?

14:32.467 --> 14:33.567
- No. I didn't see them.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.200
- I left you two straws
under your door.

14:35.233 --> 14:38.033
- I probably stepped on them.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.433
- And Garcelle
wasn't at the house?

14:39.467 --> 14:41.033
Obviously not.
- No, I didn't see her.

14:41.066 --> 14:42.567
- When does Garcelle get here?
- She's got an hour.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.033
- She's getting in
at, like, 4:00-something.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.300
And Garcelle is
staying at the hotel

14:46.333 --> 14:48.033
'cause she didn't want
to stay at the house.

14:48.066 --> 14:49.433
- I'll just stay with Garcelle.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.066
- She didn't want to stay
at the house because of COVID.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.200
Or maybe it's someone.
Who knows?

14:55.233 --> 14:57.367
- Well...
- We'll find out tonight.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.300
- Well, it could be both of us.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.266
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.467
Listen, the way
we have put it is,

15:04.500 --> 15:07.300
let it be, let us move on,

15:07.333 --> 15:09.066
and take it one day at a time.
- Right.

15:09.100 --> 15:13.000
- I just want you to know that
it's going to take some time.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.066
- And I'm okay with that.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.467
- So we're there.
- Okay.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.467
We aren't where we used to be,
but you can't rush it.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
And I also don't want
to force it.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.200
So it is what it is.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.166
- Did she every follow you back
on Instagram, out of curiosity?

15:25.200 --> 15:28.100
- I don't know.
- Okay.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.233
- I don't care.

15:29.266 --> 15:31.233
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.

15:31.266 --> 15:34.166
But again, I don't check,
so I don't know.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.767
And I don't really want
to know.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.433
But I doubt she has.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.000
And I don't care.

15:39.033 --> 15:40.467
- I know, because I check.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.467
She's not following you.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.333
She doesn't follow
either one of us, okay?

15:44.367 --> 15:46.200
- It's a shame
not to follow me,

15:46.233 --> 15:49.333
'cause I am ----ing funny.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.066
- What time is now, 3:00?
- 3:00.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.100
- A little after 3:00.
3:04.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.500
- Okay, you guys,
let's go back to the house.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.100
- All right.
- Garcelle is coming.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.600
- How do I get up?

15:57.633 --> 15:59.533
- I am not--
you are not using me.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.100
- Would you like
to use my back?

16:01.133 --> 16:02.100
- Yes!

16:02.133 --> 16:03.467
- Coming up...

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
- You don't even know what
a broom looks like, probably.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.367
- I do.
I ride one, darling.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.133
- This is really bothering me,
that stain there.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.367
- Where are
those COVID bitches?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.567
- Oh, my God!

16:31.600 --> 16:34.133
- I am not taking any chances
with any of you.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.333
- Dorit, Kathy,
please come down here.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.300
I cannot. No.
- I am not--

16:38.333 --> 16:41.333
- That just scared the sh--
out of me!

16:41.367 --> 16:45.166
Hilarious. See, this is
the Garcelle that I love.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.233
Free, fun,
nonjudgmental Garcelle

16:48.266 --> 16:50.066
having a good old time.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.233
I love this Garcelle.

16:51.266 --> 16:54.400
- I am disinfecting all of you.
- Okay.

16:54.433 --> 16:55.667
- These bitches had COVID.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.266
I'm not walking in there
without being prepared.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.166
- What does this do?
- Turn around!

17:00.200 --> 17:02.700
- Beep, beep, beep, beep!
- I'll hug you either.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.467
- No, not me.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.700
- We're not hugging.
We're, like--

17:05.734 --> 17:07.500
- That suit could have
some germs on it.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.400
- Yeah, we're not hugging.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.166
- I'm heading to the hotel
to, uh,

17:11.200 --> 17:12.433
get ready for dinner.
I'll see you guys later.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.467
- All right.
I'll see you in a while.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.200
- Hi.
- Hi!

17:30.233 --> 17:31.600
Come in, pretty.
- Hi, honey.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.734
- Oh, my God.
You look gorgeous.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.200
- Thank you. So do you.
I like the black.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.667
- Come sit. I'd offer you
a cocktail, but...

17:37.700 --> 17:41.467
- That's okay. We have
plenty of time for that.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.633
-
- How's it going?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.533
- I feel like
it's been going really well.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.300
I also feel like
I've been here for a week.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.667
You missed a lot last night,
like, with Erika.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.500
She really just wore her heart
on her sleeve last night.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.467
It was just heartbreaking.
I mean, like, he's cheating.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.367
- What?
- He's sick.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.467
I mean, there's so much.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.734
- That's shocking.
- It's really sad.

18:02.767 --> 18:05.200
- Hold on.
Tom is cheating?

18:05.233 --> 18:07.633
When she was at my house,
it was a different story.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.767
So no third party on his part?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.567
- Not that I know of.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.266
- I don't know why
she wouldn't admit that to me,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.367
you know, especially
knowing my background.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.700
Wow, I can't believe she
talked about all that stuff.

18:19.734 --> 18:21.233
- Yeah.
- Let's go eat.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.500
I'm starving.
- Okay. Okay, let's go.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.133
- It's next door,
so I don't need a mask.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.233
- It's literally next door.
Yeah.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.300
- Thank you so much.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.433
Miss Erika. Erika.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.567
- I'm coming.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.433
- Hello?
- Hi. Come in.

18:36.467 --> 18:37.500
- Hi!

18:37.533 --> 18:40.266
- Erika.
- Oh, hi!

18:40.300 --> 18:42.667
- There you are.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.700
- Hi.
- Look at this room.

18:43.734 --> 18:45.433
- You look amazing.
- I do not.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.367
- This is a casita.
- It is.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.433
Look at this whole thing, man.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.433
- This is a mansion.
- Yeah.

18:49.467 --> 18:50.567
- This is amazing.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.667
- Hi, mama.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.700
- All right,
let's have a drink.

18:52.734 --> 18:54.133
Let's have a drink!
- Yes.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.000
- Are you the bartender?
- It's such a compliment,

18:56.033 --> 18:57.233
you guys want me
to make drinks.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.567
I'm coming.
- She is great at it.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.400
Erika.
- Yeah.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.467
- Girl.
- Yeah.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.767
- I swear to God, what doesn't
break you makes you stronger.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
- Really? I'm waiting.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.266
- No, not yet.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.367
- There they are.
- Hi.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.500
- This view of this mountain
is amazing!

19:16.533 --> 19:18.333
- Oh, how beautiful.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.200
- Hi, my love.

19:20.233 --> 19:21.533
- Nobody wanted to listen.
- Look at you.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.300
You look gorgeous.
- So pretty. I love that green.

19:23.333 --> 19:26.367
- Happy holidays.
And that's a color on you.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.600
- Thank you.
- Oh, there's Miss Crystal.

19:28.633 --> 19:30.200
- I asked her
to make the drinks.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.467
- I think I'm gonna
try one of these.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.767
- Cheers, you and me.
Cheers.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.033
- Sitting?
- We're sitting.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.533
- It's beautiful.
I love that.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.700
I think I'm gonna--do you want
to move over just a hair?

19:38.734 --> 19:40.100
- Yes, I will.

19:40.133 --> 19:41.433
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you. You too.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.533
- What a gorgeous group!

19:43.567 --> 19:45.333
- Wait, who do you have?
You have Laia here?

19:45.367 --> 19:47.300
- Yeah. 'Cause
she's with Tiago all day.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.633
- Wait, they're all
in the back, in the casita?

19:49.667 --> 19:51.667
- One person and my dog.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.000
I don't have anybody anymore.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.567
You know, I used
to have two housekeepers,

19:54.600 --> 19:57.300
and I don't--I don't have
any of that, so...

19:57.333 --> 19:58.500
- Right.
- Look.

19:58.533 --> 20:01.567
I learned how to go
into a bank in March.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.467
- What?
- Yeah.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.233
I didn't know how to deposit.
I never had a debit card.

20:06.266 --> 20:09.266
- We need to take care
of ourselves.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.633
- But for 22 years,
it was not my life.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.333
So there you go.

20:13.367 --> 20:14.700
- I don't know how to use one.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.500
I don't know.

20:16.533 --> 20:17.767
Just give yourself
a little time.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
- Yeah. It's a--
it's a whole new world.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.734
Are you hungry?

20:22.767 --> 20:25.333
- I am starving!

20:25.367 --> 20:27.066
- I'm really ready
to eat dinner.

20:28.467 --> 20:29.667
we had to order room service,

20:29.700 --> 20:32.066
but it has arrived
in these bags.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.333
- It's a sack dinner.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.600
- So let's not be
too precious about it

20:35.633 --> 20:37.467
and figure out what this is.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.266
- Oh, my God.
I ordered a lot.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.633
- This is hysterical.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.333
I love this.
- It's a picnic.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.367
- You know, this is
actually kind of cute.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.600
- Oh, no.
I got salsa on my coat.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.467
- I could eat, like,
double this food.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.266
- Me too.
I like it that you eat.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.667
- Oh, you missed last night.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.066
- I heard a little bit.
- No, we were waiting for you.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.567
We were excited
that you were coming.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.633
- Aw, I'm so happy I came.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.633
I'm sorry
I missed the night before.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.767
- I made lasagna,
a big thing of bread.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.500
Kathy goes,
"Do you need any help?"

21:04.533 --> 21:06.266
You didn't help at all!
- I did.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.533
I swept the kitchen.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.633
- You swept it with a--
with a spatula.

21:09.667 --> 21:11.367
What are you doing?

21:11.400 --> 21:14.300
Kathy, that's for the barbecue,
and you're putting glass in it.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.433
That's not a cleaning brush!

21:15.467 --> 21:17.433
- I thought
it was a floor cleaner.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.500
- You don't even know what
a broom looks like, probably.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.500
- I do.
I ride one, darling.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.266
- By the way, we Googled...
- Uh-huh.

21:26.300 --> 21:30.000
- An address and found
one of your houses here.

21:30.033 --> 21:31.567
- Look.
Even has a satellite view.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.000
Wait, wait, wait. Right there.
- Oh, did he sell it?

21:35.033 --> 21:36.667
- Oh.
-

21:36.700 --> 21:38.400
- Is it the one close to you?

21:38.433 --> 21:40.000
- It's less than a mile away.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.467
But I don't think
you have it anymore.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.600
I think that was sold.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.533
- How can you sell that
without telling me?

21:47.567 --> 21:49.000
- You can't.

21:49.033 --> 21:52.333
And when they do the forensics,
they'll find it.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.533
Forensics is super important.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.767
That's how they can determine
what your spousal support is.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.400
And in California,
your spouse's assets

22:01.433 --> 22:02.734
are communal property.

22:02.767 --> 22:05.667
- It said that it was sold
in 2018, I think.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.467
- Huh, nice.
Thank you. Really?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.500
- But, Erika,
almost more important

22:10.533 --> 22:12.433
than your attorney is
your forensics team.

22:12.467 --> 22:13.567
- Yes, it is.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.567
- Especially with these--
like, these men.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.166
- Yeah.
- Wow.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.166
- Wait, to find out what?
I'm confused.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.000
- It goes through all
of your financial history

22:23.033 --> 22:24.567
to see, like, what exactly
the assets were.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.533
- Something like
selling something in 2018,

22:26.567 --> 22:27.767
which I wasn't aware of,
you know?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.066
- Which she didn't know.

22:32.166 --> 22:33.467
- Deep, deep, deep.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.567
Like Turks and Caicos money.
- Like, anywhere offshore.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.166
- Like show money?
- Yes.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.467
- Offshore, through
different holding companies.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.767
- Yes.
- Like, deep, deep, deep.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.066
- Really?
- Yes.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.433
- They can find any of it.
- Oh, yeah.

22:43.467 --> 22:45.734
- Do you know of good people?
- Yes. I think so.

22:45.767 --> 22:47.433
- You can hire
my ex-husband's team.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.667
They're excellent.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.400
- Big money, you want
to find out where it is.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.000
- Yeah.
- Because you get half of it.

22:52.033 --> 22:53.500
Right?
- Yeah.

22:53.533 --> 22:55.033
- So you want to find out
where it is.

22:55.066 --> 22:58.367
- You want to know exactly
where every single penny is.

23:02.033 --> 23:03.467
- All right,
let's go around the table.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.734
- Let's go around,

23:04.767 --> 23:07.600
and one word that
you think of yourself. Go.

23:07.633 --> 23:10.567
- I'm hardworking.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.700
- Dorit, you forgot talkative.

23:12.734 --> 23:14.567
- One word.
- I would say I'm honest.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.734
- Oh, that's good.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.066
- What's one word?

23:18.100 --> 23:19.400
- There's too many.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.567
- Narrow it down.
- I'm gonna--

23:23.600 --> 23:25.533
- One.
- Proud.

23:25.567 --> 23:27.700
- Oh!
- Oh, great!

23:27.734 --> 23:29.166
Great word.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.500
You. What's the one word
you say about you?

23:32.533 --> 23:35.400
- I will say, um...

23:38.500 --> 23:39.567
I don't know what's the word.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.100
I can't think of a word, but--

23:41.133 --> 23:43.166
- What would Confucius say?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.100
- Oh, my God!
- What would Confucius say?

23:45.133 --> 23:47.400
- Oh, shut up!

23:47.433 --> 23:48.533
- She was related to him.

23:48.567 --> 23:50.500
- Wait, you're related
to Confucius?

23:50.533 --> 23:51.667
- Yeah, he is my ancestor.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.233
I'm a descendant of Confucius.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.100
- Oh, wow!
That's amazing.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.000
- Oh, I thought you were
----ing being rude.

23:57.033 --> 23:58.533
- No!

23:58.567 --> 24:00.700
- She thought I was being rude!
- I thought she was being rude.

24:00.734 --> 24:03.600
- Why, Kyle?
'Cause I'm Chinese?

24:03.633 --> 24:05.767
'Cause I'm Asian?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.734
- How did you discover
that you were a descendant?

24:08.767 --> 24:10.033
- A descendant?

24:10.066 --> 24:12.467
So my dad was
actually born in Qufu,

24:12.500 --> 24:14.166
which is the village
where Confucius was born,

24:14.200 --> 24:16.000
so we're, like, kind of
the first generation

24:16.033 --> 24:17.767
to, like, be born
outside of the village.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.567
- Oh!
- We actually have

24:19.600 --> 24:22.233
the longest family tree
in the world.

24:22.266 --> 24:24.266
- What?
- Yeah.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.734
I'm one of the descendants.

24:25.767 --> 24:28.133
76th generation.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.133
- You.
- Eccentric.

24:30.166 --> 24:31.567
- For sure.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.000
- You didn't get a chance.
- I'll go.

24:33.033 --> 24:35.066
- Would you like a chance?
- Yes. I'm tough.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.100
But not in the sense of, like,
"I'm gonna kick your ass,"

24:38.133 --> 24:40.700
but, like, mentally,
I'm really tough.

24:40.734 --> 24:44.133
- My love, I think you and I

24:44.166 --> 24:47.433
are very similar in to--
there's a hard shell,

24:47.467 --> 24:51.767
but there's a very fragile
person inside.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.033
- Totally.

24:53.066 --> 24:55.533
- And I think, you know,

24:55.567 --> 24:58.066
you've had
to fight your way up.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.767
- And I'm not done.
- No, you're not done.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.200
And I'm not worried about you.

25:02.233 --> 25:06.467
You know, we will always
end up on top.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.467
- Yes, Erika projects
this tough girl persona,

25:10.500 --> 25:12.633
but you can only take so much.

25:12.667 --> 25:15.100
-
- I am so tired.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.700
- I mean,
will she come out on top?

25:19.633 --> 25:22.700
I don't know.

25:22.734 --> 25:25.133
- Ladies, thank you...
- Erika, thank you.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.700
- For coming over.
- So hospitable.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.700
- Get home safe, y'all.

25:29.734 --> 25:31.266
- Coming up...

25:31.300 --> 25:32.734
- I want you to see what
your mom is wearing right now.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.767
- How are you?
- Oh, my God.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.266
I have a headache.
I think maybe

25:49.300 --> 25:51.200
I drank a little too much
last night.

25:51.233 --> 25:52.333
- Oh, my God.

25:52.367 --> 25:53.767
- Some of the girls
are going shopping.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.166
I am not going shopping.

25:55.200 --> 25:59.133
I'm gonna go hiking
with Crystal and Erika.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.200
- No kidding.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.734
- We're going shopping.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.266
I'm so excited.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.700
- You guys,
if I don't buy gifts

26:11.734 --> 26:13.233
for my kids online today--

26:13.266 --> 26:15.000
- You're doomed.
- Harry has got me stressed

26:15.033 --> 26:16.533
I'm not gonna be able
to have gifts on time.

26:16.567 --> 26:17.667
- Well, because Harry said,

26:17.700 --> 26:19.100
if you don't get it now,
it's not coming.

26:19.133 --> 26:20.333
- And if Harry says it,
I mean--

26:20.367 --> 26:22.133
- If Harry says it...
- It's true.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.000
- This man knows
about his shopping.

26:25.233 --> 26:27.066
- Oh, my God.
Okay, I'm going to get ready.

26:32.033 --> 26:33.400
- Wow, you guys.

26:33.433 --> 26:35.133
This is beautiful.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.200
- There is something special
to the desert.

26:37.233 --> 26:38.767
- Yeah.
- God, if these people

26:39.000 --> 26:40.734
came out their backyard,
they just look up on this.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.300
- I know. That's every day.
- Stunning.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.500
- So good.
- Yeah.

26:43.533 --> 26:46.100
- There's, like,
little animals scurrying by.

26:46.133 --> 26:47.133
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.767
- As long
as they stay little.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.734
My mom lived in Miami.

26:51.767 --> 26:54.000
She was so afraid of lizards

26:54.033 --> 26:56.400
that you couldn't even
open the door to get in it.

26:56.433 --> 26:58.200
She'd be like, "Shut the door!
Shut the door!"

26:58.233 --> 27:00.133
And I'm like, "Mom,
I'm still coming through it."

27:00.166 --> 27:02.667
- Were there not any lizards
in Haiti, though?

27:02.700 --> 27:05.000
- I don't remember
seeing lizards in Haiti.

27:05.033 --> 27:06.200
- Did you spend a lot of time
in Miami?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.700
- When my mom was alive,
for sure,

27:07.734 --> 27:10.000
I spent more time there.
- Right.

27:10.033 --> 27:11.367
When did she pass--
- How many are you?

27:11.400 --> 27:12.767
- There's seven of us.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.667
- What number are you?
- I'm the last of seven.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.600
There's Maurice, Erose,

27:17.633 --> 27:20.633
Gladys, Chantal, Elie...

27:20.667 --> 27:22.133
Who am I missing?
I'm missing someone.

27:22.166 --> 27:23.166
Oh, my God.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.000
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.

27:26.033 --> 27:27.300
- And where is everyone?

27:27.333 --> 27:29.033
- Mainly Florida.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.767
My sister Carol!
I forgot about her.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.066
Oh, my God!
I love you, Carol.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.233
Wow, you guys.
Look at this.

27:36.266 --> 27:38.300
- Oh.
- Wow.

27:38.333 --> 27:40.767
- This is so pretty, guys.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.400
- Wow!
- Come on.

27:42.433 --> 27:45.633
- Oh, that is pretty.
- This is amazing!

27:45.667 --> 27:48.400
- Wow, you guys.
- Really pretty.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.200
- See, wasn't that
worth it, guys?

27:50.233 --> 27:52.066
Over shopping?
- Yeah.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.367
- So happy
to be shopping today.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.133
- And the weather's
so gorgeous!

27:55.166 --> 27:56.233
- Such a pretty day.
- Gorgeous.

27:56.266 --> 27:58.233
- I feel a little kick
in my step.

27:58.266 --> 28:01.100
- Uh-oh.
- Well, let's go in here.

28:01.133 --> 28:02.400
- Welcome, ladies.
- Hi there.

28:02.433 --> 28:04.033
How are you?
- Hi!

28:04.066 --> 28:05.133
- This is so cute.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.734
- Ooh, this is groovy.

28:06.767 --> 28:09.100
- Champagne for you,
if you'd like it.

28:09.133 --> 28:10.700
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's very sweet.

28:10.734 --> 28:12.066
- That is very nice.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.734
- You need a sip of this?
- Yeah.

28:13.767 --> 28:15.400
- You know what, Sutton?
- Let's--yeah.

28:15.433 --> 28:19.200
- Happy holidays.
- Happy holidays.

28:19.233 --> 28:22.033
- You look like a vision with
your champagne with the berries

28:22.066 --> 28:25.166
and your pink and--
- I'm very Palm Springs today.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.333
- What am I?
- You're very houndstooth-y.

28:27.367 --> 28:28.467
You're, like, foxhounding.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.100
- I'm, like,
very British today.

28:30.133 --> 28:32.100
- You're very British today,
darling.

28:32.133 --> 28:33.400
Happy Christmas.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.767
- Oh, my gosh.
Look at Kathy.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.133
- Cute.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.367
- Hi.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.500
- Hi, honey, what's going on?

28:39.533 --> 28:41.200
- It's snowing so much.

28:41.233 --> 28:43.133
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

28:43.166 --> 28:44.433
- Hold on one second.

28:44.467 --> 28:46.300
- Who is this? Nicky?
- Nicky.

28:46.333 --> 28:49.266
- Nicky, I want you to see what
your mom is wearing right now.

28:53.066 --> 28:55.367
- Nicky. Nicky.
- She doesn't listen!

28:55.400 --> 28:57.166
- Vogue, vogue, vogue.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.066
- I'm telling you.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.033
And then all the girls
are like, "She looks great."

29:03.066 --> 29:05.767
I'm like, "Yeah,
she's not your sister. Thanks."

29:06.000 --> 29:07.367
- Do I look that silly?
- See, look at Nicky.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.133
See, Nicky looks chic
even sitting at home.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.100
She matches her Hermès pillows.

29:12.133 --> 29:14.033
- With her coffee cup.
- That's kind of sickening.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.333
- "Your outfit's awful. Bye."
She hung up on you.

29:17.367 --> 29:20.166
- Bye? Well, that was--
my outfit--okay.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.166
Well, you know what, I'm not--
I'm not at a fashion show.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.533
- Well, you say that every day.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.233
- It's a girls' trip
in the desert.

29:29.266 --> 29:31.133
Who are we trying to impress?

29:31.166 --> 29:34.166
Like, what, am I supposed
to be all dolled up?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.000
- Garcelle and Crystal
and Erika coming,

29:37.033 --> 29:38.333
or are they doing
their own thing?

29:38.367 --> 29:39.533
- No, they're going
to clear their minds in a hike.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.100
- Clear their minds?
- Yeah.

29:41.133 --> 29:43.500
- What better way can you
clear your mind than shopping?

29:46.166 --> 29:47.233
- Wow.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.200
It's so peaceful.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.033
- So what's going on?

30:00.066 --> 30:03.033
- Nothing.
I want to find out about you.

30:03.066 --> 30:05.433
- Well...
- Where are you at?

30:05.467 --> 30:07.467
What are you--
what are you thinking?

30:07.500 --> 30:09.433
Do you wake up in the morning
and go,

30:09.467 --> 30:11.166
"What am I facing today"?
- Yeah.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.567
It's a new story every day.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.200
- Did something happen today?

30:15.233 --> 30:19.433
- There's a hearing today
in Chicago.

30:19.467 --> 30:23.433
I don't know what about yet.
I'll find out, but, you know.

30:23.467 --> 30:25.200
- But you don't have
to be a part of all these--

30:25.233 --> 30:28.300
- No. I'm not--I'm not being--
- And did he--

30:28.333 --> 30:30.166
So his business
was his business,

30:30.200 --> 30:31.333
and yours was yours.

30:31.367 --> 30:33.200
Like, did you get an allowance?

30:33.233 --> 30:35.333
Like, how did it work? Like--

30:35.367 --> 30:37.467
- No, I didn't get
an allowance.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.166
- Listen, I know that
I'm not supposed to ask people

30:40.200 --> 30:41.200
about their finances...

30:41.233 --> 30:42.300
How'd you get your money?

30:45.400 --> 30:48.533
But no debit card,
no allowance?

30:48.567 --> 30:52.433
It's killing me inside
not to ask her.

30:52.467 --> 30:54.367
Did you guys share everything,
like, in terms of

30:54.400 --> 30:57.200
both on the house,
both on finances?

30:57.233 --> 30:59.400
- All of that is kept
very far away from me.

30:59.433 --> 31:02.266
Credit cards.
Yeah, life was on credit cards.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.633
And I would get cash from Tom.

31:03.667 --> 31:07.100
He always had cash on,
so if I just needed some money,

31:07.133 --> 31:10.100
I'd ask,
"Can I have some money?"

31:10.133 --> 31:11.567
Tom was doing all of that,

31:11.600 --> 31:14.133
so I'm not privy
to any of that.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.100
- Oh. That's good.

31:16.133 --> 31:17.567
- It's actually very good.
- Mm-hmm.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.066
- Yeah. It keeps you away
from it.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.100
- Well, it's not my business.
It's not my law firm.

31:22.133 --> 31:23.233
- Right.
- I'm not a lawyer.

31:23.266 --> 31:24.600
- Yeah.

31:24.633 --> 31:28.000
With any of the lawsuits,
like, did you have a heads-up?

31:28.033 --> 31:29.233
Is that why you got divorced?

31:34.533 --> 31:36.166
- Coming up...

31:36.200 --> 31:37.567
- Erika shared,
if you don't mind me saying,

31:37.600 --> 31:39.500
that Tom calls her.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.166
- Well, I do mind
you saying that,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.100
'cause I feel like
you're betraying my friendship

31:43.133 --> 31:45.266
right now, but please,
have your moment.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.133
- With any of the lawsuits,
like, did you have a heads-up?

31:53.166 --> 31:55.700
Is that why you got divorced?

31:55.734 --> 31:58.633
- No, I did not.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.300
This was a long time coming,

32:01.333 --> 32:04.333
a long battle with someone

32:04.367 --> 32:07.300
whose personality
has completely changed.

32:07.333 --> 32:08.433
Three years ago,

32:08.467 --> 32:10.567
he had a terrible,
terrible head injury.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.400
- Really?
- Yes.

32:12.433 --> 32:16.066
And there was a significant
shift in his personality,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.300
his decision-making,
and who he is.

32:18.333 --> 32:19.600
- He had a car accident
a few years ago.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.166
- Right.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.367
- Which is when
you started seeing signs.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.567
- Oh! I just put that together.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.700
- There was severe decline.
- Mm.

32:28.734 --> 32:31.467
- And it comes down
to simple things,

32:31.500 --> 32:34.567
like there was no conversation.
- Really?

32:34.600 --> 32:37.367
- The conversations
that I used to have with him,

32:37.400 --> 32:39.467
the back-and-forth,
was no longer.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.667
The repetitive phrases,

32:41.700 --> 32:45.367
the forgetting
what we were talking about.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.233
I would hear the same stories
ten times in one day.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.300
And if you said,
"Oh, I remember that"...

32:50.333 --> 32:51.533
- Right.
- Rage.

32:51.567 --> 32:53.033
- Sure.
- Wow.

32:53.066 --> 32:54.667
- Like, I was a whipping boy.
- What do you mean?

32:54.700 --> 32:58.467
- Just, he would
lay out on me anything.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.600
It was the anger,
the frustration.

33:00.633 --> 33:02.200
I took it all.
- Wow.

33:02.233 --> 33:04.200
- That kind of thing--
like, I watched this--

33:04.233 --> 33:06.600
my grandmother had Alzheimer's,
so I watched that,

33:06.633 --> 33:08.400
and I was like,
"(BLEEP), I know what this is.

33:08.433 --> 33:09.533
Like, I saw this."
- Wow.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.467
- And I think that
he denied it to himself.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.133
Like, "This isn't happening."
- Yes.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.166
- You know, how your dad--
- Same thing.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.467
- Her father had Alzheimer's.
- Oh.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.633
- It's so horrible.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.367
It's like being a prisoner
in your house.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.233
You had to leave,
because the caretaker,

33:22.266 --> 33:25.367
the people taking it,
are the ones who really suffer.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.467
- Yeah.
- They decline. They get sick.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.667
And my mom was, like-
just, like, in a mental, like--

33:29.700 --> 33:31.667
- Oh, I bet.
I'm so ----ed up mentally.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.500
- Yeah. It was three years
too long that you had to stay.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.467
- This is sad.
- So if all those things

33:36.500 --> 33:39.266
truly happened that they're
saying happened, do you think

33:39.300 --> 33:42.433
it's because mentally,
things were in decline?

33:42.467 --> 33:44.200
- Yeah. I do.
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:44.233 --> 33:45.567
- I don't think that--

33:45.600 --> 33:47.266
- Intentionally.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.533
- No.
- Got it.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.767
- Part of true brain trauma
is making decisions

33:52.000 --> 33:53.767
that you wouldn't
normally make.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.633
It's hard to watch someone
go through this.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.166
And there is nothing
I can do to help.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.667
- Yeah.
- That's gotta be frustrating.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.333
- I tried. He doesn't listen.
He's resisting everything.

34:04.367 --> 34:05.767
Still to this day.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.433
Well, from what I'm told.

34:07.467 --> 34:08.667
When I came home
from Broadway,

34:08.700 --> 34:10.367
we kind of had a reconnection,

34:10.400 --> 34:12.166
'cause we would eat dinner
together every night.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.700
But things had
definitely changed.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.333
He was changing rapidly.

34:15.367 --> 34:19.400
And the refusal to acknowledge
anything that was happening.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.166
- I'm so sorry.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.367
- The calls I was getting
from his lawyers at the firm.

34:24.400 --> 34:27.400
One of his lawyers
crying on the phone to me,

34:27.433 --> 34:29.467
"We have to do something.
We have to do something."

34:29.500 --> 34:31.233
What is it that we can do?

34:31.266 --> 34:33.166
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's do it.

34:34.500 --> 34:40.166
Such a bizarre ending
to a career,

34:40.200 --> 34:41.633
you know.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.300
- Since we're not
going shopping,

34:43.333 --> 34:45.467
maybe we can have a mimosa.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.266
- After this sh--,
yeah, I want some liquor.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.233
- By the way, it will pass.
It's just right now.

34:51.266 --> 34:53.667
- Right, I just wish
that all of this pain

34:53.700 --> 34:56.734
that he's in would stop
for him.

34:56.767 --> 34:59.533
And that--turn in the Bar card,
let's work it out, you know?

34:59.567 --> 35:01.567
Like, obviously,
I have not talked to him,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.367
and I cannot talk to him.
- Right. Right.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.467
- Even though
he calls me every day.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.433
He does?
- Mm-hmm.

35:07.467 --> 35:10.033
That's another hard part of it.
- Oh.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.633
- I had to ask my attorney
to call his attorney to say,

35:12.667 --> 35:14.467
"Please stop calling Erika."

35:14.500 --> 35:17.533
Tom is in legal jeopardy,
and I cannot talk to him.

35:17.567 --> 35:18.700
And if I am asked,

35:18.734 --> 35:20.400
"When was the last time
you spoke to him?"

35:20.433 --> 35:22.567
I have to be able to say,
you know, the day I left,

35:22.600 --> 35:24.333
which is the truth.

35:24.367 --> 35:25.767
You know, it's just horrible.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.333
"I love you.
Miss you.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.633
Come home.
Are you sure?"

35:30.667 --> 35:33.266
- Can you imagine?
- Like, stop. You gotta stop.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.400
You have to stop, honey.
You need help.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.333
- Wow.
- And I can't give it.

35:37.367 --> 35:39.700
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
- God.

35:47.367 --> 35:48.333
- Thank you.

35:50.033 --> 35:51.367
- Thank you.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.000
- Ooh, it's actually--
it's later than I thought.

35:53.033 --> 35:54.600
- What time is it now?
- It's 2:00.

35:54.633 --> 35:57.467
- Oh. You beat us.
- I sure did.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.066
How beautiful is this view?

35:59.100 --> 36:01.467
- I mean, this is such a
pretty, pretty, pretty place.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.633
- It really is.

36:03.667 --> 36:05.367
- Hello!

36:05.400 --> 36:06.700
Hello, ladies.
- Hey.

36:06.734 --> 36:09.367
- Hello, ladies!
- Hi.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.500
What'd you buy?
What'd you buy?

36:10.533 --> 36:11.767
Did anybody buy me anything?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.633
No.

36:13.667 --> 36:16.066
- Just a few little things,
you know.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.300
- How was your hike?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.000
- It's actually very pretty.
- Yeah.

36:19.033 --> 36:20.033
- Was it beautiful?

36:20.066 --> 36:21.433
- We were, like,
in the mountains.

36:21.467 --> 36:23.767
- Okay, I gonna go potty.
- I'm changing.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.500
- Okay, so Kathy's
picking up tacos,

36:26.533 --> 36:28.033
but I'm gonna
set some stuff out.

36:28.066 --> 36:29.500
Um, is that good?

36:29.533 --> 36:31.033
- We can get down
with some desserts.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.500
- Yeah, I'm like--
I can eat whatever.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.700
- Desserts? Okay.
Let me get on it.

36:34.734 --> 36:39.633
- You sharing
that Tom calls you

36:39.667 --> 36:41.400
is the saddest thing I've--

36:41.433 --> 36:42.633
- Yeah, it's bad.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.767
- Whew!
Do you feel like saying,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.667
"Stop the train.
I want to get off"?

36:46.700 --> 36:48.367
- I'd like to get off.
- Oh, wait.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.667
Wait. Uh-oh. Why?

36:49.700 --> 36:52.000
- You really would want
to get off this one.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.467
- Oh, my God, she has
the man with the tacos.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.033
-
Of course! Kathy.

37:10.367 --> 37:12.100
- You make me happy, darling.

37:12.133 --> 37:14.000
- Hi, Kathy.
What'd you get?

37:15.633 --> 37:17.533
- Did you?
I love tacos.

37:17.567 --> 37:20.400
- Kathy does nothing
that isn't extra.

37:20.433 --> 37:22.667
She can't just buy,
like, eight tacos.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.367
She has to buy, like, 58 tacos.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.667
- I'm having a taco.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.533
- Kyle, will you
spend Christmas here?

37:28.567 --> 37:31.000
- I'll be in Aspen
for Christmas.

37:31.033 --> 37:35.066
- I will be in Hancock Park
in my little abode.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.333
- Are you gonna put up a tree?

37:36.367 --> 37:37.667
Are you doing that?
- I was just gonna say that.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.767
- Someone gave me a pink tree
to put up.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.066
- They did?
- Oh, how cute.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.567
- Oh, good!
- Yeah.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.700
Yeah, just, I needed something
to feel fun and light.

37:45.734 --> 37:48.467
You know, just the whole
lighten up the mood, and--

37:48.500 --> 37:49.667
- What was
the latest development

37:49.700 --> 37:51.667
that you were saying?
- I'm waiting

37:51.700 --> 37:54.066
for, um, a transcript.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.433
I'm waiting.
I think I know what it is,

37:56.467 --> 38:00.166
but I want to make sure that
I know what it is before I say.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.600
I have to be careful here,

38:01.633 --> 38:04.400
because when you're talking
about lawyers being involved,

38:04.433 --> 38:06.567
it's always best to be quiet

38:06.600 --> 38:10.500
and keep it very, very,
very close to the vest.

38:10.533 --> 38:14.166
And oftentimes, that doesn't
satisfy people's curiosities,

38:14.200 --> 38:17.567
but it is, in fact,
your best interest.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.066
I may go back early.
I'm not gonna lie, you guys.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.734
- Oh, are you?
- I might.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.734
Depending on what news I get,
I may go back early.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.600
- I get it. I'll go with you,
if you need company.

38:26.633 --> 38:30.066
- I may need to go deal
with some sh--.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.734
- Erika shared,
if you don't mind me saying,

38:32.767 --> 38:36.467
that Tom calls her.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.133
- Well, I do mind
you saying that,

38:42.166 --> 38:44.066
'cause I feel like
you're betraying my friendship

38:44.100 --> 38:46.133
right now,
but please, have your moment.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.400
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

38:48.433 --> 38:49.767
Go ahead, babe.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.433
- No, I don't want to do it
like that.

38:52.467 --> 38:54.633
- So let me
tell the ----ing story.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.600
Tom calls me all the time.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.500
I won't take his calls.

39:03.533 --> 39:04.700
And you got it out of me once,

39:04.734 --> 39:06.433
and now you want
to do it again.

39:06.467 --> 39:07.700
- That's not my intention.
I don't--

39:07.734 --> 39:09.066
- Don't ----ing sugarcoat it.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.667
- Erika shared,
if you don't mind me saying,

39:17.367 --> 39:19.633
that Tom calls her.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.667
- Tom calls me all the time.

39:23.533 --> 39:25.033
I won't take his calls.

39:25.066 --> 39:26.266
And you got it out of me once,

39:26.300 --> 39:28.000
and now you want
to do it again.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.533
- That's not my intention.
I don't--

39:29.567 --> 39:31.600
- Don't ----ing sugarcoat it.

39:34.667 --> 39:37.166
- I have seen Erika
lose her temper.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.700
- She didn't kill your child.

39:38.734 --> 39:41.200
- Shut the up.

39:41.233 --> 39:43.000
Let me finish, Dorit.
You talk a lot.

39:43.033 --> 39:45.467
- You don't talk enough.
- I say important sh--.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.700
You say too much boring sh--.

39:47.734 --> 39:49.166
It's possible.
- You pretending that

39:49.200 --> 39:51.467
it's fully amnesia right now
is confusing.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.133
- Don't ever,
ever do that to me.

39:54.166 --> 39:57.533
- I don't even know
why she is so upset.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.033
But when Erika gets triggered,

39:59.066 --> 40:01.633
she goes from 0 to 100.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.500
- We were walking back.

40:04.533 --> 40:07.166
You said that.
You shared with us.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.667
What the (BLEEP)?

40:11.700 --> 40:13.300
She's been so open.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.233
She talked about
Tom cheating on her.

40:15.266 --> 40:18.567
She talked about something
changed in his brain makeup.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.266
This is what
I would never want to do

40:21.300 --> 40:24.734
is that look on her face,
looking at me right now.

40:24.767 --> 40:29.133
And so for me
to mention Tom calling her,

40:29.166 --> 40:31.500
why would that set her off?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.600
- I was
sharing a private moment,

40:38.633 --> 40:41.233
something that I haven't said.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.000
Sometimes not everything
is up for discussion.

40:49.033 --> 40:52.600
Just because someone tells me
something about one of you

40:52.633 --> 40:54.700
does not mean
I'm bringing it up.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.600
I've been very open.

41:03.633 --> 41:04.700
- Yes, you have.

41:04.734 --> 41:06.333
- And very honest.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.734
So I think that was dirty.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.700
- Erika.
- You know.

41:13.734 --> 41:15.166
- I get
you're going through a lot.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.033
I totally understand.

41:17.066 --> 41:19.066
I've said to you
the fact that--

41:19.100 --> 41:21.100
- But you didn't have
to do it twice, Garcelle.

41:21.133 --> 41:23.533
You did it once.
You didn't have to do it again.

41:23.567 --> 41:26.667
You did it twice.
- Okay.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.734
- You know?
- I'll own it.

41:27.767 --> 41:29.233
- You already got it once.
- Got it.

41:29.266 --> 41:32.233
- You didn't have to do it
in front of them.

41:32.266 --> 41:33.767
Once was enough.

41:36.266 --> 41:38.166
- Got it.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.333
I thought she wanted
to share it with the group.

41:40.367 --> 41:44.100
I didn't think me asking Erika
about Tom calling her

41:44.133 --> 41:46.200
to the friends
that she's known the longest

41:46.233 --> 41:47.767
was a big deal.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.266
- There's only so--

41:51.300 --> 41:53.266
that I can take right now,
you guys.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.667
I...

41:55.700 --> 41:58.734
- It's okay.
-

41:58.767 --> 42:01.667
I-I just want to go
to the bathroom for...

42:01.700 --> 42:03.367
A minute.

42:07.433 --> 42:10.300
- It's just a lot right now.
I mean, obviously--

42:16.166 --> 42:18.400
- I don't know.
- No, she shared it with us.

42:18.433 --> 42:20.266
But you had already
got in the car when she said,

42:20.300 --> 42:22.100
"I don't want
to talk about it."

42:22.133 --> 42:24.367
So you didn't hear that.
- Oh, okay.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.100
- I think if someone
shares something and says,

42:27.133 --> 42:29.100
"You know, listen,
I don't want to talk about it,"

42:29.133 --> 42:31.133
or if she gave you
an indication--

42:31.166 --> 42:33.133
- But you're making it like
I did this intentionally,

42:33.166 --> 42:35.166
and it's not--
and it's not the truth.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.033
- No, I know, 'cause
you were in the car already.

42:37.066 --> 42:38.200
You did not hear.
I know that.

42:38.233 --> 42:39.767
- I would never want
to hurt her.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.400
She's already
going through a lot.

42:41.433 --> 42:44.367
I would never want to do that,
but I never got told not to.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.633
- This is a misunderstanding.

42:46.667 --> 42:48.433
I knew Erika didn't want
to talk about this,

42:48.467 --> 42:51.400
so when Garcelle
brought it up...

42:51.433 --> 42:55.066
And it just went
to the worst possible place.

42:55.100 --> 42:56.433
If you were there with me,

42:56.467 --> 42:58.433
I know you would have been
like me and not said anything.

42:58.467 --> 43:00.233
- No, I didn't know.
- No, I know.

43:00.266 --> 43:02.367
- Wait, I'm confused.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.367
What did Garcelle ask
that was so bad?

43:05.400 --> 43:08.166
People don't react
to questions like that

43:08.200 --> 43:10.433
unless something else
is happening.

43:33.734 --> 43:35.100
- Next time on

43:35.133 --> 43:36.667
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:36.700 --> 43:39.033
- It's real, isn't it?
- It's vintage Cartier.

43:39.066 --> 43:40.367
- You're so ----ing rich.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.033
Hey, let's play a game.

43:42.066 --> 43:44.500
- Games always lead to trouble.
Great!

43:44.533 --> 43:47.767
Rinna shared with us today
that Harry has acrylic nails.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.433
- Oh, my God!

43:52.367 --> 43:53.433
- Oh, God.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.200
It's implying that
Erika was complicit.

43:58.233 --> 44:00.400
- They used the word
"Ponzi scheme."

44:00.433 --> 44:02.767
- It's almost as if
we've not known her at all.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.166
- I'm not sure

44:04.200 --> 44:08.166
I want to be around Erika
during this time.
