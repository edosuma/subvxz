<i>Who wants</i>

00:20.676 --> 00:22.643
Mommy's Famous Pancakes
with a chocolate chip

00:22.678 --> 00:25.346
happy face on 'em?
I don't get why they're so happy.

00:25.347 --> 00:27.748
They're about to be eaten.
And then worse.

00:27.783 --> 00:29.951
I kind of want to slap
the smile off him.

00:29.952 --> 00:33.221
Aw. When you guys were little,
you loved Mr. Flapjack.

00:33.222 --> 00:35.155
Now you're just
a bunch of pancake poopers.

00:35.191 --> 00:37.525
Dad, get it!
It could be the president

00:37.526 --> 00:38.893
of breakfast calling
to congratulate us.

00:38.894 --> 00:40.227
Hello?

00:40.262 --> 00:42.062
Bob, it's me, Critter.

00:42.097 --> 00:43.798
Oh, hey, Critter.
Hey, Critter! Hi, Critter.

00:43.799 --> 00:45.866
Hey! Hi, Critter!
So, how are you?

00:45.901 --> 00:48.870
Oh, can't complain, except
for the fact that I'm in jail.

00:48.871 --> 00:50.138
You're in jail?
Critter got pinched.

00:50.139 --> 00:51.371
What happened?

00:51.407 --> 00:52.874
Uh, it's silly, really.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.609
I got stopped
for a broken taillight,

00:54.610 --> 00:57.845
and it turns out I owed $9,000
in unpaid parking tickets.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.113
Wow, that's a lot
of unpaid parking tickets.

01:00.149 --> 01:01.749
Bob, I'm in an outlaw
motorcycle club.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.151
We don't pay parking tickets.

01:03.152 --> 01:05.053
In fact, we make kind of
a whole big thing

01:05.054 --> 01:06.454
about throwing 'em out.

01:09.925 --> 01:11.525
Yeah! Yeah! Mmm!

01:11.560 --> 01:13.228
But I got to pay off this fine
and get out of jail.

01:13.229 --> 01:14.895
That's where you come in.

01:14.930 --> 01:17.598
W-Wait, wait. You want me
to help you get out of jail?

01:17.633 --> 01:19.234
Jailbreak!
Tell him we're in.

01:19.235 --> 01:21.402
I'll put on a dress
and distract the guard!

01:21.403 --> 01:23.136
Yoo-hoo!
Just practicing.

01:23.172 --> 01:25.106
Listen, Bob, I need you
to sell my bike for me

01:25.107 --> 01:27.140
so I can pay off this fine
and get out of here.

01:27.176 --> 01:28.476
Can't you call Mudflap?

01:28.477 --> 01:30.411
No, Mudflap's
on a wilderness retreat

01:30.412 --> 01:31.913
called "Women of the Wild."

01:31.914 --> 01:33.748
They teach you
how to survive in the woods...

01:33.749 --> 01:36.316
which dirt's edible, how to
confuse a bear, stuff like that.

01:36.352 --> 01:37.985
Oh. Who's watching your baby?

01:38.020 --> 01:39.420
Sidecar's with the sitter.

01:39.421 --> 01:41.289
Look, I got a buyer lined up.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.091
He'll give you ten grand for it.
That'll cover my fine.

01:43.092 --> 01:45.326
Oh, I-I can't really
help you sell a motorcycle

01:45.327 --> 01:47.529
that's probably...
stolen, I'm assuming.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.098
Narc!
Bob, the bike's not stolen.

01:50.099 --> 01:52.033
It's made from stolen parts.

01:52.034 --> 01:54.469
Once you put them all together,
it's a brand-new bike. Hmm.

01:54.470 --> 01:56.037
Here's what you got to do.

01:56.038 --> 01:58.473
Go to my apartment,
get my bike, go to the buyer.

01:58.474 --> 02:00.073
Another outlaw biker guy?

02:00.109 --> 02:02.610
No, no, no, no, an investment
banker guy named Kenny.

02:02.611 --> 02:04.612
He's super straight-laced,
kind of a big nerd,

02:04.613 --> 02:06.648
but he thinks this biker stuff
will make him cool.

02:06.649 --> 02:08.816
So when you drop off the bike,
make him feel cool.

02:08.817 --> 02:10.318
He'll give you the money,
you pay my fine,

02:10.318 --> 02:12.687
I get out of jail, we high five.

02:12.688 --> 02:14.455
Critter, I really wish we could
help, but...

02:14.456 --> 02:16.624
Bob, my phone time's up.
I need a yes or no answer here.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.394
No? Damn it! I don't know
why I gave you that option.

02:19.395 --> 02:21.162
So, let me get this straight.

02:21.163 --> 02:23.830
Critter asked you for help,
and you told him to rot in jail?

02:23.866 --> 02:26.266
Louise, that's not what
happened... exactly.

02:26.302 --> 02:27.969
I just hope
when <i> we</i> call you from jail,

02:27.970 --> 02:29.536
you'll help <i> us</i> out.
Yeah.

02:29.572 --> 02:31.506
Of course we will!

02:31.507 --> 02:34.074
And bring us a cake with
a smaller cake smuggled inside it!

02:35.411 --> 02:37.078
So, we could stay here

02:37.079 --> 02:38.946
at our boring restaurant
all day,

02:38.981 --> 02:42.383
or we could help an outlaw biker
sell his motorcycle.

02:42.384 --> 02:43.951
This is a no-brainer!

02:43.986 --> 02:45.687
No.
Come on!

02:45.688 --> 02:47.221
We never do fun activities
together!

02:47.222 --> 02:49.023
This family is falling apart!

02:49.024 --> 02:51.158
We're all just strangers
under the same roof.

02:51.193 --> 02:53.161
Guys, selling
a probably stolen bike

02:53.162 --> 02:55.196
isn't a fun family activity.

02:55.197 --> 02:58.565
Going to the zoo is
a fun family activity.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.368
Aw, I love the zoo.

03:00.369 --> 03:01.402
So many animals.

03:01.403 --> 03:03.171
Yeah, yeah.

03:03.172 --> 03:04.572
I don't know this number.

03:04.573 --> 03:06.340
That's exciting.
Hello?

03:06.375 --> 03:08.742
Bob, it's me again.
I'm talking on a butt phone.

03:08.777 --> 03:09.743
What's a butt phone?

03:09.778 --> 03:11.446
Well, it's a cell phone

03:11.447 --> 03:13.246
somebody smuggled in here
in an orifice of his body.

03:13.282 --> 03:15.450
Oh, okay.
Come on, I'm desperate here.

03:15.451 --> 03:17.150
You're the only one
I can ask for help.

03:17.186 --> 03:19.287
Why don't you just ask
the One Eyed Snakes?

03:19.288 --> 03:21.321
The biker gang
that you're the leader of?

03:21.357 --> 03:24.092
I'm kind of on
a break from the One Eyed Snakes.

03:24.093 --> 03:25.859
What? I can't understand you.

03:25.894 --> 03:28.562
I'm on a break
from the One Eyed Snakes.

03:28.597 --> 03:30.364
I still can't make out
what you're saying.

03:30.399 --> 03:33.000
- I'm on a break from
the One Eyed Snakes! - Hey.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.268
Oh. Really?
You left the One Eyed Snakes? What?!

03:35.304 --> 03:36.904
Great. Now everybody
in jail knows.

03:36.905 --> 03:38.373
I'm probably
gonna get picked last

03:38.374 --> 03:40.108
for riots and stuff like that.

03:40.109 --> 03:42.276
What-what happened?
I'm a dad now.

03:42.277 --> 03:43.811
I-I can't go out
till 6:00 in the morning

03:43.812 --> 03:45.379
and then get up
at 6:00 in the morning.

03:45.414 --> 03:47.615
I get it. Everything changes
when you have kids.

03:47.616 --> 03:49.784
I heard your penis
gets stretched out,

03:49.785 --> 03:51.618
and it's never the same. Gene.

03:51.654 --> 03:54.288
Also, I got a straight job
at What the Tech.

03:54.289 --> 03:56.223
It's an electronic superstore.

03:56.258 --> 03:57.725
Critter, that's great!

03:57.726 --> 03:59.994
I know, I know, right thing,
blah, blah, blah.

03:59.995 --> 04:02.664
But here's why I got to
get out of jail ASAP.

04:02.665 --> 04:04.265
I start today at 4:00.

04:04.266 --> 04:06.434
If I don't show up,
I don't have a job.

04:06.435 --> 04:09.137
And if I don't have a job,
I can't provide for my family.

04:09.138 --> 04:11.339
But I guess I could always
go back to robbing.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.141
Oh, come on, Critter.
Looting.

04:13.142 --> 04:15.410
Critter. Coming up with more
and more interesting ways

04:15.411 --> 04:17.478
to sell crystal methamphetamine.
Critter.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.613
But maybe you can live with
that; maybe I had you wrong.

04:19.615 --> 04:21.516
Okay, fine, I'll help you.

04:21.517 --> 04:24.252
Oh, thank you, Bob!
I'm eternally grateful!

04:24.253 --> 04:25.652
See you soon.
Love you.

04:25.688 --> 04:27.088
Bye. Love you, too.

04:27.089 --> 04:28.656
What happened?
You love him?

04:28.657 --> 04:31.425
Oh, I guess I'm gonna help
Critter sell his bike.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.927
Yay!

04:32.928 --> 04:34.462
Lin, will you and the kids
watch the restaurant?

04:34.463 --> 04:36.798
- I'm gonna go to Critter's.
- No!

04:36.799 --> 04:38.366
I know you guys want to go,

04:38.367 --> 04:40.501
but Lin, someone has
to watch the restaurant.

04:40.502 --> 04:42.102
I want to see the baby.

04:42.137 --> 04:44.138
Come on, Dad.
It's either this or the zoo.

04:44.139 --> 04:46.306
And nobody wants to go
to the zoo except Mom.

04:46.341 --> 04:48.109
I love the zoo.
Fine.

04:48.110 --> 04:49.610
I guess we're closing
the restaurant

04:49.611 --> 04:52.079
so we can help sell
a mostly stolen bike.

04:52.114 --> 04:55.016
Yay! Close the restaurant!
Baby!

04:55.017 --> 04:57.793
Zoo!
Tina! Oh. Right. Bike!

04:59.235 --> 05:00.524
Hi, baby! Boop, boop!

05:00.525 --> 05:01.925
Critter just texted.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.193
From the butt phone?
I'm waiting for a fart fax.

05:04.229 --> 05:07.196
He said to look for his
garage key next to the skull.

05:07.232 --> 05:08.965
Which skull?
There are, like, 20 of them.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
This one's cool.

05:10.001 --> 05:11.201
Hi. How are you?

05:11.202 --> 05:12.969
I don't know, I just
have a headache.

05:13.004 --> 05:15.272
So, Sidecar just ate,
and I have to go.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.907
Wait. What?
No, no, no.

05:16.908 --> 05:18.841
Critter didn't say anything
about watching the baby.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.510
Well, I have an exam.

05:20.511 --> 05:22.279
And the professor says
I have to start going to those.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.780
It's okay.
I can watch the baby.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.349
Lin, no, we...
Give me the baby.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.717
Oh, I got the baby!

05:26.718 --> 05:28.552
He needs his nap soon.

05:28.553 --> 05:30.721
And he's a little...
difficult to put down.

05:30.722 --> 05:32.756
And if he doesn't get
his nap, he's...

05:32.757 --> 05:34.791
I don't want to say
a horrifying monster,

05:34.792 --> 05:36.927
but, um, have you seen
that movie <i> Monster?</i>

05:36.928 --> 05:38.896
Oh, I can put him down.
I have three kids.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.763
I can still rock Gene to sleep.
Gene, come here.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.932
No! Stay away, you sleep witch!

05:42.967 --> 05:45.302
Aw. Okay,
so call if you need anything.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.404
But also, don't call
because I'll be in my exam.

05:47.405 --> 05:49.706
Found the key. I'm supposed
to take the motorcycle

05:49.707 --> 05:51.909
to a guy named Kenny
on Water Street.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.877
Great. How are we supposed to
get it all the way over there?

05:53.878 --> 05:55.445
I'll drive it.
No, Louise.

05:55.446 --> 05:56.713
I guess I'll roll it over.

05:56.714 --> 05:58.014
That's bad ass, Dad.

05:58.049 --> 05:59.515
You know what?

05:59.550 --> 06:01.285
I'm just gonna put him
in the stroller,

06:01.286 --> 06:03.553
walk around the block, and I bet
he falls asleep right away.

06:03.554 --> 06:05.222
He just needs
an experienced mom.

06:05.223 --> 06:06.790
Come on, baby.
Ooh, the baby.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.925
I'm killin' it with this kid.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.661
I'm glad Mom has
someone else to smother

06:10.662 --> 06:12.129
so I can finally grow up and...

06:12.130 --> 06:14.035
Ooh! Rattle!
Shake, shake, shake!

06:14.065 --> 06:16.166
Whoa!
Ah!

06:16.167 --> 06:18.200
Oh, whoops,
you got away from me! Huh!

06:18.236 --> 06:19.636
I got you back. You're safe.

06:21.272 --> 06:23.272
♪ Sidecar thinks
I'm a fun Mommy... ♪

06:23.308 --> 06:26.542
Sidecar, do you like your name?

06:26.577 --> 06:29.078
Oh, no. Yeah, I like it, too.
It's really... pretty.

06:29.113 --> 06:30.646
Oh, Hot Totties!

06:30.682 --> 06:32.115
I used to take the kids here

06:32.116 --> 06:34.050
when they were babies. Hmm.

06:34.085 --> 06:35.819
You're supposed
to be napping right now.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.454
But you know what would be good?

06:37.455 --> 06:39.589
To go in there
and get you tired out.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.124
You want to go in?

06:41.125 --> 06:42.425
Just look at me and say nothing
if you want to go in.

06:43.828 --> 06:45.462
I-I said say nothing.

06:46.764 --> 06:48.111
Say nothing.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.232
All right, great,
we're going in.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.171
This bike doesn't sound well.

06:54.172 --> 06:55.605
Yeah, it doesn't
handle well, either.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.673
You know, you guys are
making this much harder.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.675
And it kind of has an attitude.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.610
Hey, that guy keeps
turning when we turn.

07:01.646 --> 07:03.680
He's wearing loafers.
You know what that means.

07:03.681 --> 07:05.314
He's got pennies.

07:05.350 --> 07:07.817
Maybe he should use them
to buy socks. Am I right?

07:09.354 --> 07:11.320
Let's see
if Preppy Pete turns, too.

07:11.356 --> 07:13.522
He is following us!

07:13.558 --> 07:15.192
No, he's not, Louise.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.627
He's just coincidentally turning
when we turn.

07:17.628 --> 07:20.364
Maybe he's never seen a man's
back sweat as much as yours.

07:20.365 --> 07:22.299
My back's not...
Oh, my God, it is.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.699
Mm-hmm.

07:26.137 --> 07:27.537
Aw! That's nice.

07:27.538 --> 07:29.006
They get along, don't they?

07:29.007 --> 07:30.407
Yeah. They're baby buddies.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.342
What's this one's name?
Sidecar.

07:32.343 --> 07:33.744
What?
Si... Simon.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.212
Simon. Says.

07:35.213 --> 07:37.147
Well, that's a nice name.
Thank you!

07:37.148 --> 07:39.649
This is Jacob.
Hi, Jacob!

07:39.650 --> 07:41.984
I'm Linda.
And I'm Bethany.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.053

Hey, he called me Mama!

07:44.088 --> 07:46.022
He's never... done that before?

07:46.057 --> 07:47.723
Ah... no!

07:47.759 --> 07:50.193
Well, this is a special moment!

07:50.194 --> 07:52.996
Yeah, it sure is, because,
uh, I-I'm Simon's mama!

07:52.997 --> 07:54.398
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.404
Right now,
till we go home later.

08:00.405 --> 08:02.171
Are you married?
Yeah. No, yeah.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.775
Well, this is the address.

08:05.843 --> 08:07.010
Looks like we lost our stalker.

08:07.011 --> 08:08.445
Louise, no one is stalking us.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.414
Yeah, 'cause we lost him.

08:10.415 --> 08:12.849
Are you Bob? Uh, yeah.
Kenny, right?

08:12.850 --> 08:14.751
Critter's bike. Wow.

08:14.752 --> 08:16.620
You guys don't look
like One Eyed Snakes.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.021
How dare you.

08:18.022 --> 08:19.556
You don't look like a Kenny.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.024
Yeah, you look like an Ethan
or a Chad.

08:21.025 --> 08:22.459
Nice jacket.
A lot of zippers.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.628
Not too many, right?
No, no, no, no.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.430
Wait, are you being sarcastic?

08:26.431 --> 08:28.698
'Cause I'm really sensitive
right now. I just bought this.

08:28.699 --> 08:31.067

08:31.102 --> 08:34.437
Okay, let's fire her up,

08:34.472 --> 08:35.938
Uh, okay. Yeah.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.607
Time to go hog wild.

08:37.607 --> 08:38.841
Time to go...

08:38.876 --> 08:40.077
Okay, time to go...

08:40.078 --> 08:41.111
Hmm. Okay, time to...

08:41.111 --> 08:42.578
Hog. Time to go...

08:42.580 --> 08:44.581
Let's try that again. Ready?
Time to go ho... Ow!

08:44.582 --> 08:46.149
Time to go, oh, hog.
That's not it.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.984
I'm starting to feel
bad for the bike.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.619
Maybe it's just not time
to go hog wild.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.121
Ah, there. Ah.

08:51.122 --> 08:52.555
There we go. Wow.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.891
Nothing like the sound
of a 1,200-cc engine

08:54.892 --> 08:57.460
in the body
of an outlaw hog, uh?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.162
Hey, we gotta split, man!
The meth house is gonna blow!

08:59.163 --> 09:00.730
I'm just kidding.

09:00.731 --> 09:02.264
No, I'm not.
We gotta go, man, we gotta go!

09:02.300 --> 09:05.102
Uh, Kenny, maybe we should
finish our transaction

09:05.103 --> 09:07.036
so we can leave, and then
you can keep doing that?

09:07.071 --> 09:09.572
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sure.
I'll go get the money.

09:09.607 --> 09:12.141
I'm leaving it running
because I love the sound.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.010
And not because you're not
strong enough to start it again.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.244
Right!

09:17.181 --> 09:18.682
No! Stop!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.350
What the...?
Where's my bike?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.185
Preppy Pete just stole it!

09:22.186 --> 09:23.620
The stalker.

09:23.621 --> 09:26.039
Well, great.
Now I can't trust stalkers.

09:27.215 --> 09:29.627
See, that guy <i> was</i> stalking us.

09:29.662 --> 09:31.897
This stinks!
This sucks! Language!

09:31.898 --> 09:33.398
Oh, God, I have to tell Critter

09:33.399 --> 09:34.900
that someone stole his bike.

09:34.901 --> 09:36.735
The bike that was gonna
get him out of jail

09:36.736 --> 09:38.337
and put his life
on the right track.

09:38.338 --> 09:40.205
Would it be rude if
I just texted him that?

09:40.206 --> 09:42.273
No, I should call.
You're gonna call the butt phone?

09:42.308 --> 09:44.375
Yes, Tina, and please
stop saying "butt phone."

09:44.410 --> 09:46.043
Can I have one more?
Okay, one more.

09:46.079 --> 09:48.179
Butt phone. Actually, wait,
can I save it for later?

09:48.214 --> 09:49.447
Fine.
Yes...

09:49.482 --> 09:51.716
Hi. Can I, uh,
please speak with Critter?

09:51.751 --> 09:53.085
Hold, please.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.353
Hey, Bob, are you here?
You got the money?

09:54.354 --> 09:55.654
Hey, I talked to Candace.
Um...

09:55.655 --> 09:57.656
Thanks for taking care
of Sidecar.

09:57.657 --> 09:59.892
He's a sweet little fella.
'Less he doesn't get a nap.

09:59.893 --> 10:02.261
Then he gets extremely violent
and he just starts swingin'.

10:02.262 --> 10:03.529
Takes after his mother.

10:03.530 --> 10:05.364
Uh, listen, Critter, um,

10:05.365 --> 10:08.533
someone, uh, kind of...
stole your motorcycle.

10:08.568 --> 10:10.569
Bob, I sincerely hope
you didn't say

10:10.570 --> 10:11.803
what I think you just said.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.906
Someone stalked us and stole it!

10:13.907 --> 10:15.673
He was wearing fancy pants!

10:15.708 --> 10:16.975
Whoa, whoa, hold-hold on.

10:16.976 --> 10:18.677
Did Gene just say "fancy pants"?

10:18.678 --> 10:20.312
Yeah, he did have nice pants.

10:20.313 --> 10:21.547
Loafers?
Yeah.

10:21.548 --> 10:22.981
Socks or no socks?

10:22.982 --> 10:24.383
Um... no socks?

10:24.384 --> 10:26.251
That sounds like Carl.
Carl?

10:26.252 --> 10:28.086
Yeah, I called Carl first,
before Kenny.

10:28.087 --> 10:31.423
He's another nerdy finance guy
who collects outlaw biker stuff.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.058
Another one?!
What's with these guys?

10:33.059 --> 10:34.760
I don't know.
I kind of get it.

10:34.761 --> 10:36.028
They're trapped
in a world of numbers,

10:36.029 --> 10:37.462
but their lives don't add up.

10:37.463 --> 10:39.064
All bills, no thrills.

10:39.065 --> 10:40.399
Breaks your heart, really.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.800
Carl tried to lowball me,

10:41.801 --> 10:43.702
so I told him I was gonna
sell to somebody else.

10:43.703 --> 10:45.437
That no-socks son of a bitch

10:45.438 --> 10:47.004
must've been pissed off
enough to steal it.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.373
Well, should we call the police?

10:48.374 --> 10:50.876
Whoa! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No Po Po.

10:50.877 --> 10:52.544
This bike has some stolen
qualities, remember?

10:52.545 --> 10:54.011
Right, right, right.

10:54.047 --> 10:56.415
Bob, I'm supposed to start work
in a few hours.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.150
I don't want to put pressure
on you, but this is

10:58.151 --> 10:59.318
my entire life in your hands.

10:59.319 --> 11:01.118
I know, I know.

11:01.154 --> 11:04.288
You've got to find Carl Lumpkin
and get my motorcycle back.

11:04.324 --> 11:06.058
How am I supposed
to find Carl Lumpkin?

11:06.059 --> 11:07.426
Oh, I know Carl Lumpkin.

11:07.427 --> 11:08.894
You do? Oh, yeah sure.
We play squash.

11:08.895 --> 11:10.796
He stole your bike.
He did what?!

11:10.797 --> 11:13.397
Oh, that is classic Carl.
He also cheats at squash.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.500
Is that Kenny?
Yeah. Kenny knows Carl.

11:15.501 --> 11:16.935
Put him on.
He wants to talk to you.

11:16.936 --> 11:18.637
Oh, boy.
Um, how do I look?

11:18.638 --> 11:20.405
Amazing.
This is Kenny.

11:20.406 --> 11:21.907
You know where
Carl Lumpkin lives?

11:21.908 --> 11:23.308
Why, are you gonna kill him?

11:23.309 --> 11:25.244
No, you are.

11:25.245 --> 11:27.479
No, I'm just yankin' your chain.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.749
I gotcha. I gotcha.
You got me so... so good. Ah.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.685
Now, what you're gonna do is you're
gonna go to his house... Uh-huh, yes.

11:33.686 --> 11:35.454
get your bike...
Uh-huh.

11:35.455 --> 11:38.590
...and give my money to Bob.
Okay. Okay, cool plan. Yeah.

11:38.591 --> 11:40.259
Put Bob back on.
Really enjoyed talking to you.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.527
Bob, listen, if Carl
gives you any trouble,

11:42.528 --> 11:43.929
you're the muscle.
Be tough.

11:43.930 --> 11:45.530
Um. H-How do I do that?

11:45.531 --> 11:47.332
Intimidate him.
Make a threat.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.767
Maybe something
in the stabbing department.

11:48.768 --> 11:50.269
Ever stab anybody?
No.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.004
Well, don't tell him that.

11:52.005 --> 11:54.006
Ooh, Bob, got to go.
You don't get a lot of minutes

11:54.007 --> 11:56.341
on these prepaid
cavity phones. Go get 'em.

11:56.342 --> 11:59.211
Please tell me he told you
we had to stab somebody.

11:59.212 --> 12:00.846
He did.
Yes!

12:00.847 --> 12:02.314
Let's get stabby, Flabby!

12:02.315 --> 12:03.314
Ow.

12:04.617 --> 12:05.951
Look at 'em.

12:05.952 --> 12:07.185
Might be too many baby cooks

12:07.186 --> 12:08.887
in the baby kitchen, right?

12:08.888 --> 12:11.123
Yeah, if you can't
stand the baby heat...

12:11.124 --> 12:13.058
get out of the baby kitchen.
Get out of the baby oven.

12:13.059 --> 12:14.859
It's oven.

12:14.894 --> 12:16.795
Oh. Oh, it's my husband.

12:16.796 --> 12:18.830
Hi, babe. We're gonna
be a little late, I think.

12:18.831 --> 12:21.198
Simon's still awake.
I'm trying to tire him out.

12:21.234 --> 12:22.901
Who's Simon?
Sidecar.

12:22.902 --> 12:25.037
I'm at Hot Totties
with some fun young moms

12:25.038 --> 12:27.339
and they think Sidecar's my son.
And he called me Mama.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.641
And I call him Simon.
And we're just going with it.

12:29.642 --> 12:31.510
Okay. Well,

12:31.511 --> 12:33.644
Critter's bike got stolen
and I'm supposed to threaten

12:33.680 --> 12:36.547
to stab this guy. So we're
gonna be a little late, too.

12:36.582 --> 12:38.216
Huh. Well, I guess
my day's going a little better

12:38.217 --> 12:40.085
than yours... Oh! Oh!
Oh!

12:40.086 --> 12:42.053
Oh, God. He's throwing fake
food everywhere.

12:42.088 --> 12:43.855
Oh. Right.
They said he gets violent

12:43.856 --> 12:46.624
if he doesn't nap, so...
good luck with that.

12:46.659 --> 12:48.193
Ooh!
Linda?

12:48.194 --> 12:49.361
Bob, I got to go.
The other moms are watching.

12:49.362 --> 12:51.096
Ow, ow. Oh!

12:51.097 --> 12:53.965
Remember, Dad,
your biker name is Mustache Manny

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
and you once
ate somebody's eyebrows

12:55.501 --> 12:56.868
for looking at you funny.

12:56.869 --> 12:58.403
And you hate cilantro.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.072
Give me a Mustache Manny face.

13:01.407 --> 13:02.674
Chills.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:02.675 --> 13:04.176
Look at you, Dad.

13:04.177 --> 13:06.011
You're having fun, aren't you?

13:06.012 --> 13:08.346
No. Just trying to get into
character.

13:08.381 --> 13:10.047
Wait, wait, shh, shh.
Do you hear that?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.050
You look at my bike again

13:12.051 --> 13:13.751
and you're dead meat.
It's coming from the backyard.

13:13.786 --> 13:15.687
Yeah, I don't play by the rules.

13:15.688 --> 13:17.021
Carl!
Uh-oh.

13:19.292 --> 13:21.760
Hi. Uh, can I help you?

13:21.761 --> 13:23.728
Oh, hey, Kenny.

13:23.763 --> 13:26.698
Carl.
Super-duper cool to see you, bud.

13:26.699 --> 13:28.934
Uh, I cannot hang out right now.

13:28.935 --> 13:31.069
I've got something on the stove,

13:31.070 --> 13:33.204
and I don't want it to burn.

13:33.239 --> 13:34.773
Oh what a coincidence, 'cause
you know what else is burning?

13:34.774 --> 13:36.074
Your pants,
because you're a liar!

13:36.075 --> 13:38.009
And that jacket
looks ridiculous on you.

13:38.044 --> 13:40.011
I-I've gotten
a lot of compliments. Bye.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.246
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

13:41.247 --> 13:43.048
Carl, we know you have

13:43.049 --> 13:44.316
Critter's bike in there.

13:44.317 --> 13:45.951
Give it back. Now.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.652
Or I'm gonna eat your eyebrows.

13:47.653 --> 13:49.121
What?

13:49.122 --> 13:51.022
I mean, I'm gonna st...
I'll stab you.

13:51.057 --> 13:54.059
What Mustache Manny
the dangerous outlaw biker

13:54.060 --> 13:57.461
is trying to say
is hand over the bike, pal.

13:57.497 --> 13:59.630
Uh, I don't know what bike
you guys are talking about.

13:59.665 --> 14:02.199
Oh, yeah? Then what's
the motorcycle shaped-lump

14:02.235 --> 14:04.268
in your backyard?
Eh, that's not a motorcycle.

14:04.303 --> 14:07.138
Oh, it's not? What is it then?
My, uh... horse?

14:07.173 --> 14:08.607
Go on.
That is <i> my</i> outlaw hog!

14:08.608 --> 14:09.807
Hey!

14:09.842 --> 14:12.677
Aha!
Where'd my horse go?

14:12.678 --> 14:14.846
Butterscotch.
Butterscotch.

14:16.516 --> 14:18.817
That's how you do it, Kenny. No!

14:18.818 --> 14:19.818
Get off, get off! Get...
You're squishing my face!

14:19.819 --> 14:21.152
Get off me. Get off!

14:21.187 --> 14:22.921
Don't! Stop it! Ge...
Oh, my God.

14:22.922 --> 14:24.756
Ge... Don't do that! Aah! Stop it.
Aah! Oh!

14:24.757 --> 14:25.791
Again, again!

14:25.792 --> 14:26.958
Are you guys okay?

14:26.959 --> 14:28.193
Yeah. Just tell me one thing.

14:28.194 --> 14:29.594
Did I look cool?

14:29.595 --> 14:31.762
I think you know
the answer to that.

14:36.636 --> 14:39.504
He's fine.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.706
He's okay.

14:41.707 --> 14:43.208
You're okay.

14:43.209 --> 14:44.942
Aah!

14:44.977 --> 14:47.212
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
This is bad.

14:47.213 --> 14:48.980
And we're running out of time.

14:48.981 --> 14:51.049
Kenny, you've gotta give us
the money. We gotta go.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.316
No, I'm not buying
a damaged bike.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.752
But you damaged it.

14:53.753 --> 14:55.353
You know what? Carl really
seems to want it and I'm gonna

14:55.354 --> 14:57.088
step back and graciously
allow him to have it.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.956
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You should have it.

14:58.991 --> 15:00.659
You-you look really good on it.
No, you know what, it really goes,

15:00.660 --> 15:02.294
You look...
no, it goes great with your whole

15:02.295 --> 15:03.761
backyard tarp thing you've
got going on here, so...

15:03.796 --> 15:05.297
Hey, should we just
forget this whole thing,

15:05.298 --> 15:07.332
and take it out on the squash court?
Yes.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.867
Squash it out!
Listen!

15:08.868 --> 15:10.702
Somebody's fixing
and buying this bike,

15:10.703 --> 15:12.337
and we're getting
Critter out of jail!

15:12.338 --> 15:13.538
I nominate Carl or you.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.706
I second you.
I third.

15:14.707 --> 15:15.974
Oh, my God.

15:15.975 --> 15:17.475
Dad, quick sidebar.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.644
I know who can fix it...
the One Eyed Snakes.

15:19.645 --> 15:22.147
Louise, we can't go
to the One Eyed Snakes.

15:22.148 --> 15:23.748
We don't really
have a choice here.

15:23.749 --> 15:25.717
If these squares
aren't gonna pay to fix it,

15:25.718 --> 15:27.486
the One Eyed Snakes
are our only hope.

15:27.487 --> 15:28.653
Fine.

15:28.654 --> 15:29.921
Kenny, if the One Eyed Snakes

15:29.922 --> 15:31.223
are willing
to fix the motorcycle,

15:31.224 --> 15:32.323
would you buy it then?

15:32.358 --> 15:34.025
Do I get to meet them?
Yes.

15:34.026 --> 15:35.193
Yes!
Well, now I want it.

15:35.194 --> 15:36.495
Well, except that I want it.

15:36.496 --> 15:38.029
Well, I want it, though.
No, I want it.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.530
I want it!
I want it! I want it!

15:39.565 --> 15:40.932
Stop! Stop!
I want it!

15:40.933 --> 15:42.501
Kenny, you come with us.

15:42.502 --> 15:45.136
Carl, go back inside
and don't steal things.

15:45.171 --> 15:46.037
You're not my mom.

15:46.038 --> 15:47.706
What if he is?

15:47.707 --> 15:49.875
All right, let's roll this bike
to the One Eyed Snakes.

15:49.876 --> 15:51.776
Wait, I just want to say
good-bye to Butterscotch.

15:51.777 --> 15:52.878
Butterscotch isn't real.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.145
Right, right, right, right.

15:54.146 --> 15:56.673
Bye, Butterscotch, just in case!

16:00.769 --> 16:03.037
Uh, maybe you kids
should wait out here.

16:03.038 --> 16:04.572
Uh-uh, we started this together.

16:04.573 --> 16:06.107
We're ending it together.

16:06.108 --> 16:08.876
Yeah, like when we got
that 15-foot party sub.

16:08.877 --> 16:10.745
All right, fine,
just stay near me.

16:10.746 --> 16:12.246
That goes for you, too, Kenny.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.081
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:14.082 --> 16:16.384
Hold-hold up, you want us
to help fix Critter's bike,

16:16.385 --> 16:19.486
so you can sell it to Wolf
of Wall Street over here?

16:19.521 --> 16:21.255
Kenny, hi.
No one introduced us. Big fan.

16:22.758 --> 16:25.359
Kenny, Kenny? Kenny?
I'm sorry, got nervous.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.894
Not now, not now.
Laugh when I'm nervous.

16:26.895 --> 16:29.162
But don't you want to help
get Critter out of jail?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.465
No.
Critter hasn't talked to us in weeks.

16:31.466 --> 16:33.067
Yeah, yeah,
and when we do see him,

16:33.068 --> 16:34.702
he looks sleepy,
and he just feels

16:34.703 --> 16:36.037
like he's never present with me.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.437
Yeah, he hardly wants any meth.

16:37.472 --> 16:39.106
But he has to get out of jail.

16:39.107 --> 16:40.940
He's starting his new job today
at What the Tech.

16:40.976 --> 16:42.443
What? Oh, God,
see this is what I'm talking about.

16:42.444 --> 16:43.877
Are you kidding me?
I know!

16:43.912 --> 16:45.212
Oh, wait, I-I don't think

16:45.213 --> 16:46.881
I was supposed
to tell anyone that.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.348
Loose lips, wide hips.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.950
Listen, Bob, it's
not gonna happen.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.786
Wheel that out of here.
Before you kick us out,

16:51.787 --> 16:53.219
could I just get a couple
of selfies with you guys?

16:53.255 --> 16:54.755
Okay, just don't
get my double chin.

16:54.756 --> 16:56.323
Well, then you, I hold
the camera up like this, look.

16:56.324 --> 16:57.725
Yeah, you hold it up.
See, and gooseneck.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.125
And click.

17:01.163 --> 17:02.596
♪ Sleepity-deedy. ♪

17:03.632 --> 17:04.565
I did it!

17:04.566 --> 17:05.566
I freakin' did it!

17:05.567 --> 17:06.767
He's asleep.

17:06.768 --> 17:08.234
Ooh, Bethany, you're bleeding.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.303
Oh, yeah, just a little.

17:10.338 --> 17:12.073
But Jacob was
throwing stuff, too, right?

17:12.074 --> 17:13.486
Oh, it was a whirlwind.

17:13.508 --> 17:15.409
No, it was mostly Simon.

17:15.410 --> 17:16.844
Jacob was just covering himself.

17:16.845 --> 17:18.279
He learned the word help today.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.279
Help.

17:19.314 --> 17:20.681
Jacob, shush, shush.

17:20.682 --> 17:22.249
Please don't shush my son.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.151
Okay, look, you know,
so Sidecar got a little crazy.

17:24.152 --> 17:26.454
They said he would be hard
to put down and it's true.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.988
Who's "they"?

17:27.989 --> 17:29.256
Yeah, and who's Sidecar?

17:29.257 --> 17:30.657
Who said that?
What's going on?

17:30.692 --> 17:32.960
I, uh, okay, okay, okay, yes.

17:32.961 --> 17:35.962
I-I renamed this kid Simon
and I told you he was my son.

17:35.997 --> 17:37.230
He's not your son?

17:37.265 --> 17:38.265
Let me clarify.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.301
I did not kidnap him, okay?

17:40.302 --> 17:42.436
His father's in jail
and his mother's in the woods.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.038
I mean, she's alive!
She's fine!

17:44.039 --> 17:45.972
I'm just gonna
make a quick call.

17:46.007 --> 17:47.775
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No phone!

17:47.776 --> 17:49.443
Oh, look at that...
Jacob's getting into preschool!

17:49.444 --> 17:51.111
What? Where? Which one?

17:53.348 --> 17:55.483
Delete, delete, delete.

17:55.484 --> 17:57.351
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

17:57.352 --> 17:58.651
I like that one.
Send me that one.

17:58.687 --> 17:59.687
Send it to me, too.

17:59.688 --> 18:01.689
Looking at us laughing together.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.357
Guys, will you please just
tell Kenny you'll fix the bike,

18:03.358 --> 18:04.725
so he'll give me the money?

18:04.726 --> 18:06.259
Bob, I said no.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.795
We clearly don't mean
anything to Critter,

18:07.796 --> 18:09.596
so he doesn't
mean anything to us.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.465
Of course you guys
mean something to him.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.567
You know what?
I'll bet he misses

18:13.568 --> 18:16.303
raising hell
with all of you, uh...

18:16.304 --> 18:17.972
Lovable scamps?

18:17.973 --> 18:20.540
Right, so why don't you
try to meet him in the middle?

18:20.575 --> 18:22.877
What do you mean?
Well, like, maybe you could

18:22.878 --> 18:25.079
wake up early with Critter
and raise hell

18:25.080 --> 18:26.880
before he has
to go to work or...

18:26.915 --> 18:29.650
after work,
but before Sidecar's bedtime.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.486
Like, commit a crime
or whatever you like to do.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.888
Crime.
Right.

18:33.889 --> 18:36.090
So you do that before bedtime,
right, guys?

18:36.091 --> 18:37.992
I do my crimes before bedtime.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.560
Tuckers me right out.

18:39.561 --> 18:41.495
Ah, I guess we can be
a little more tolerant

18:41.496 --> 18:43.063
of Critter's situation.

18:43.064 --> 18:44.532
And other races.

18:44.533 --> 18:45.665
Also, for the record,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.868
having kids isn't that bad.

18:47.869 --> 18:49.570
I mean, I've spent all day

18:49.571 --> 18:51.672
doing this extremely
inconvenient favor for Critter,

18:51.673 --> 18:55.175
but being with my kids
actually made it kind of fun.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.377
Aw, that's-that's nice.
Aw!

18:56.378 --> 18:57.411
You're welcome!

18:57.412 --> 18:58.878
Ha-ha, you like your kids.

18:58.914 --> 19:01.147
So, the motorcycle...
fix it, please?

19:01.183 --> 19:03.017
Yeah, we'll-we'll fix it up.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.518
And then you can sell it
to this square over here.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.753
It's Kenny.
Or whatever you want.

19:06.788 --> 19:08.055
<i>- Hey, you guys on LinkedIn?</i>
<i>- Aw, Kenny...</i>

19:08.056 --> 19:09.623
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

19:09.624 --> 19:10.690
<i>- Me, too.</i>
<i>- Yeah, me, too.</i>

19:12.260 --> 19:13.961
You sure you want
to work today, Dad?

19:13.962 --> 19:16.263
'Cause we could find another
biker to get out of jail.

19:16.264 --> 19:17.798
Like a naughty unicyclist.

19:17.799 --> 19:19.399
No, I think I'm good.
Look.

19:19.434 --> 19:20.901
It's Critter and Mudflap.

19:20.902 --> 19:22.069
Oh, with my buddy Sidecar.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.406
Ugh! I can't
look at you like that.

19:25.407 --> 19:27.408
I know.
I can't look at myself.

19:27.409 --> 19:29.410
Yeah, at least
cut the sleeves off.

19:29.411 --> 19:31.545
I tried... my manager's
a 19-year-old boy

19:31.546 --> 19:33.580
named Randy,
and he reamed me for it.

19:33.615 --> 19:35.616
Mm.
Well, it is what it is.

19:35.617 --> 19:37.484
We wanted to bring you
a thank-you gift

19:37.485 --> 19:38.986
for helping me out yesterday.

19:38.987 --> 19:40.721
It's a phone charger
from What the Tech.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.288
It might be broken.
It was in the discount bin.

19:42.324 --> 19:44.725
This is a printer.
It's not a...

19:44.726 --> 19:47.560
Phone chargers are, like,
really small, but thanks.

19:47.596 --> 19:50.097
Damn, where were you yesterday
when I was in training?

19:50.098 --> 19:52.900
And I brought you this from
my Women of the Wild Weekend.

19:52.901 --> 19:53.933
It's a pine cone.

19:53.969 --> 19:55.401
Aw...
Give it!

19:55.437 --> 19:57.004
Well, we got to go.

19:57.005 --> 19:58.839
Uh, we got to meet
the Snakes back at headquarters.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.141
We got a nursing student
coming by to teach, uh,

20:01.142 --> 20:03.310
infant CPR class to the club.

20:03.311 --> 20:05.144
She's also gonna sell
us a bunch of OxyContin.

20:05.180 --> 20:06.981
That's, um, uh, huh.

20:06.982 --> 20:09.649
Well, I'm glad things
are better between you guys.

20:09.684 --> 20:11.619
Yeah, me, too, Bob, me, too.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.187
And, Linda, you got Sidecar

20:13.188 --> 20:14.120
to nap yesterday!

20:14.155 --> 20:15.555
I did!

20:15.590 --> 20:17.191
Incredible.
Question...

20:17.192 --> 20:19.026
will you watch him next
weekend while we drive up

20:19.027 --> 20:20.527
to Laconia, New Hampshire,
for Bike Week

20:20.528 --> 20:21.961
and go absolutely nuts?

20:21.997 --> 20:23.197
Uh, no.
Please?

20:23.198 --> 20:24.331
Please?
No, no, no, no.

20:24.332 --> 20:25.398
Worth a shot.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.600
I could do it.

20:26.601 --> 20:27.835
Hi, Sidecar...

20:27.836 --> 20:29.168
No, Tina, no!
