00:27.193 --> 00:29.028
<i> Captain Punch!</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.030
<i>Monkey Mash!</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:33.366
-I love Mega Mash Mayhem.
-Me too, and you're going down.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.161
<i>Get ready to… mash!</i>

00:38.538 --> 00:40.290


00:46.588 --> 00:48.006
Captain… Punch!

00:52.260 --> 00:54.304
<i>-Winner!</i>
-Rematch!

00:54.387 --> 00:56.014
<i>Mash!</i>

01:02.353 --> 01:03.688
<i>Winner!</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:06.232
-You got mashed!
-More!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.776
<i>Mash!</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:14.949
<i>Winner!</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.619
-Can't… stop… playing.
<i>-Mash!</i>

01:17.702 --> 01:19.579
<i>Winner! Mash!</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:22.707
<i>Winner! Mash!</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:24.459
<i>Winner! Mash! Winner!</i>

01:24.542 --> 01:26.920
<i>Winner! Winner-Winner-Winner!</i>

01:30.256 --> 01:31.883
What the what was that?

01:31.966 --> 01:35.428
That was our new Protecto-bot
saving your life.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.014
Because your Flick was on fire!

01:38.097 --> 01:40.099
It catches fire all the time!

01:40.183 --> 01:42.101
Then I huff and puff and blow it out.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.395
Cos I'm part wolf. Heh heh.

01:49.067 --> 01:53.947
Well, since you're so amazing at gaming,
just go win a new one at Don and Bobo's.

01:54.030 --> 01:54.989
I'm listening.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.451
We went to a birthday party there,
but instead of gaming,

01:58.535 --> 02:02.413
we studied the effects of bad animatronics
on the adolescent psyche.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.291
There's some rare
Mega Mash Mayhem Ultimate Bundle

02:05.375 --> 02:06.376
in the Prize Hut.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.711
You can have our game cards.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.464
Yes!

02:13.675 --> 02:16.010
-Whoa!

02:16.094 --> 02:19.389
The limited edition
Mega Mash Mayhem Bundle.

02:20.723 --> 02:23.184
And I'm here to win it!

02:24.185 --> 02:25.854
Impossible.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.899
Cos you first need to win
100,000 prize tickets.

02:29.983 --> 02:35.071
And I heard the games are rigged
to limit prize payouts.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.409
Yeah, well, we're scientists…

02:39.492 --> 02:41.828
And we'll just unrig them.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.955
Great! So you'll help me win?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.541
Right after we figure out…

02:48.293 --> 02:51.754
how to ease early
psychological damage caused by…

02:52.463 --> 02:55.508
Don and Bobo's Happy Bobo Band.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.179
<i>Hi, hi, hi, happy kids!</i>

03:01.723 --> 03:03.224
The Bobo Band!

03:03.308 --> 03:05.560
Run for your lives!

03:07.896 --> 03:08.813
Hmm.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.233
Perhaps more fluid animatronics
would lessen the trauma.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.818
Let's find out.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.945
And let's win some tickets, Dog!

04:01.199 --> 04:02.575
-Phew!

04:02.659 --> 04:03.660
Count 'em up, Dog.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.955
And high-five me when you get to 100,000!

04:07.038 --> 04:08.706
You've got 206.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.791
What?!

04:09.874 --> 04:11.501
I don't get it.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.296
These are the most
advanced robotics I've ever seen.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.132
It's like someone wants them to be creepy.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.177
Hey. I need genius big sisters
to help me win tickets,

04:21.261 --> 04:22.595
so… to the lab!

04:22.679 --> 04:26.182
But first, we need some
mischievous little brother help.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.519
Which one do you want?

04:30.436 --> 04:33.189
Simply by replacing
its core processing chip

04:33.273 --> 04:35.733
with one from the Protecto-bot…

04:37.318 --> 04:41.572
We're able to create a more fluid
and more musical Guitar-Rilla!

04:48.913 --> 04:51.249
OK, that gorilla rocks.

04:51.332 --> 04:54.210
And won't make kids run and scream.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.256
Now sisters help me unrig the games
so I can win 100,000 tickets

04:58.339 --> 05:01.217
and snag that
Mega Mash Mayhem grand prize.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.096
Well, we could unrig the games…
but wouldn't it be more fun

05:05.179 --> 05:07.557
to take some other Protecto-bot parts…

05:07.640 --> 05:11.311
And beat a rigged game
with a rigged Johnny,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.938
in robo-powered gamer gear?

05:15.398 --> 05:19.652
Don and Bobo will never suspect
you're hyper-super powered.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.740
It's still here.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.705
But not for long.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.583
Time to swipe, swipe, swipe.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.460
And play, play, play.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.763
Look! The gorilla's not scary anymore!

06:22.882 --> 06:24.300
How did we do, Not-a-Dog?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.594
One hundred thousand…

06:26.677 --> 06:28.346
and three! Heh heh heh.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.352
<i>I think we have a problem.</i>

06:35.144 --> 06:36.354
Take care of it.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.067
They're scary again!

06:43.152 --> 06:45.530
Whoa, this can't be good.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.033
The bosses want to talk to you two.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.663
And… Guitar-Rilla wants to talk to you.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.669
I'll call Johnny and tell him
to get out of here!

07:02.004 --> 07:03.506
Hey, smart sisters!

07:03.589 --> 07:07.218
I'm off to collect my Mega Mash
Mayhem grand prize!

07:08.136 --> 07:10.847
Ah, Bobo Band.
You're moving much better, I see.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.100
Is… there a problem?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.936
There<i> is</i> a problem.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.484
OK, that was kind of a fun ride,
but now I want answers!

07:24.694 --> 07:27.780
I'm afraid you're not getting
that grand prize, Johnny.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.574
Don and Bobo?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.200
In the flesh.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.371
And if someone wins the grand prize,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.708
there's no longer a reason
for kids to come back to try and win it.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.834
Cos it's gone.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.627
Just get a new one.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.964
Oh, Johnny, you know
how rare that bundle is.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.424
But I have enough tickets.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.384
Do you?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.724
Why do they have to be so creepy?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.351
Because creeped-out kids eat more.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.354
And kids with fewer tickets
want to play more.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.649
Then parents have to buy
more pizza and game cards,

08:03.733 --> 08:07.862
so we can build Don and Bobo's
Super Fun Super Center!

08:08.696 --> 08:11.616
Perhaps you noticed the construction site
when you arrived.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.202
Oh, yeah!

08:14.285 --> 08:17.038
But I won those tickets
that are now in that pouch,

08:17.121 --> 08:20.374
and I'm not leaving
without that grand prize.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.543
Oh, well, in that case…

08:22.627 --> 08:24.879
Why don't you try and take them?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.091
Maybe we will!

08:34.764 --> 08:37.475
OK, Dog o' mine. Let's mash!

08:37.558 --> 08:40.686
Yeah, but you are wearing
an enhanced robotic exoskeleton,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.146
and I'm not.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.858
-Whoops.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.237
He's still not answering his phone,
so who knows where Johnny is?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.030
-Maybe Dukey knows.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.995
Ooh, I think I know how I can mash now.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.502
Nice.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.588
Look out!

09:09.840 --> 09:12.426
Hah! This is kinda cool.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.886
And not cool.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.765
Not cool!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.810
-Ooh!
-Wow!

09:20.893 --> 09:23.145
Nobody does that to my best friend!

09:37.868 --> 09:39.203
Yeah, look out!

09:42.540 --> 09:43.916
Oh, this is bad.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.753
Then let's go super scary mode!

09:50.631 --> 09:53.467
Thanks, mash buddy!
Now let's… whoa!

09:55.928 --> 09:58.097
Guitar-Rilla is out!

10:05.646 --> 10:07.273
Not fair! Those are…

10:08.232 --> 10:09.233
my tickets!

10:09.317 --> 10:12.862
Johnny! If you clench your fingers
on your mega glove…

10:12.945 --> 10:15.489
You'll unlock a hidden pulsar feature!

10:19.827 --> 10:22.997
Don't you mean my ticket-pouch punch?

10:28.669 --> 10:30.755
We're such geniuses.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.633
You win, Johnny.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.551
I guess you'll take your tickets…

10:35.635 --> 10:38.387
And get that grand prize now.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.390
Nah. I'll let the gang use 'em
to get some smaller prizes.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.894
Really?

10:44.977 --> 10:47.772
That was the best Mega Mash game
I'll ever have,

10:47.855 --> 10:50.149
and Don and Bobo's
Super Fun Super Center

10:50.232 --> 10:51.776
sounds super awesome.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.361
But when it's done…

10:53.444 --> 10:55.780
We want the Bobo Band to be less creepy.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.782
Yeah, we'll never agree to that.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.995
OK, we'll do it!
