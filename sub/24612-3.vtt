WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.437
My goodness.

00:03.471 --> 00:06.107
Oh, looks like we missed
the third out there.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.043
Okay, well, Crawdaddys
have lost another one

00:09.077 --> 00:10.278
in the Lone Star State.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.613
That's Skip Clayton,
I'm Raj Datt.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.948
And you're the best
fans in baseball.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.750
Thanks, guys.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.987
They're not even the best fans
in Southeast Louisiana.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.490
I assumed that Raj is fired.
-Uh, nope.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.427
I showed you this to illustrate
why he's beating you.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.029
He...
At what?

00:29.063 --> 00:32.800
This is the highest-testing tape
of the entire season.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.302
It's called
the Fallon Effect.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.604
If you're having fun,
the viewers are having fun.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.772
The grin-fucker
didn't even call the game.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.241
I mean, what was
the final score?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.609
No one cares
about numbers.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.711
Do you wanna watch
Neil Degrasse Tyson

00:43.744 --> 00:45.446
explain science
to Jimmy Fallon

00:45.479 --> 00:46.814
or do you wanna watch them

00:46.847 --> 00:48.849
pass Ping-Pong balls
into each other's mouths?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.017
Neither.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.885
What, that's funny,
because the Ping-Pong ball

00:51.919 --> 00:54.988
is slightly too large?
Is that it?

00:55.022 --> 00:57.625
How many
they have going?

00:57.658 --> 01:00.361
I'm imagining four.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.896
It's actually
pretty great.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.765
The reason we came,
is we're looking for ways

01:04.798 --> 01:06.767
to close the gap
between us and Raj.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.002
Raj is the kind of guy people
wanna have a beer with

01:09.036 --> 01:10.871
and you --
you're a loaded gun

01:10.904 --> 01:12.740
that could go off
at any time.

01:12.773 --> 01:17.245
Well, America loves a loaded
gun, especially the kids.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.479
Okay, bottom line,

01:18.512 --> 01:20.314
if you wanna
get back into the race,

01:20.348 --> 01:21.415
you've got to figure
out a way

01:21.449 --> 01:22.750
to have more fun
in the booth.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.051
Well, I'm not gonna shuck it
and jive it in there

01:24.084 --> 01:25.686
like some kind of
a Stepin Fetchit.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.521
I am nobody's
house broadcaster.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.190
Jesus Christ, Jim!

01:29.223 --> 01:30.791
Please stop trying to
compare your struggles

01:30.824 --> 01:32.025
to the black experience.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.694
There are a lot
of parallels, Charles.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.330
-No, there really are not.
-Yeah. Yes, there are.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.065
No.
Now I see
why he brings you.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.667
Can I just deal with you
from now on?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.302
Yeah, that'd probably
be for the best.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.603
And you know what?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.338
Jim would be happy
to be more likeable.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.773
Excuse me, I would not.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.508
It is against
my principles.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.909
Well, that is up to you,

01:48.942 --> 01:51.412
but the organization
wants a Fallon.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.780
And Fallon
would screw a pig

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
while lip-syncing
with Mussolini

01:54.548 --> 01:55.816
if his bosses
told him to.

01:55.849 --> 01:59.420
This is not the age
for principles.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.556
Thank you.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.691
Was it me or was she
a little bit mean

02:03.724 --> 02:04.892
about Jimmy Fallon?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.594
I mean, you don't get
angry at Fredo

02:06.627 --> 02:08.696
because
he can't fire a gun.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.301
Well, the Atlanta job is
slipping through my fingers.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.635
And my best friend

02:14.668 --> 02:16.570
is moving back
to the Dominican Republic.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.573
Goddamn it, these dark,
dark times.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.443
Well, only one thing
we can do.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.945
Have one final
blow-out weekend

02:24.978 --> 02:27.181
that you and I will
never, ever forget.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.819
Brockmire,
this is a nice bar.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.053
Man, you're gonna
get us kicked out.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.655
Kicked out?
Kicked out?

02:34.688 --> 02:35.989
Look around, man.
Look around here.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.125
Watch. Boom!

02:38.158 --> 02:40.261
See? This is New Orleans,
my friend.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.731
This is where the Devil comes
to get his dick sucked.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.333
Every carnal pleasure
was invented

02:45.366 --> 02:46.800
right here in this city.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.870
Movie theaters,
cocktails, cotton candy,

02:49.903 --> 02:51.405
the walking handjob.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.906
I never heard of that.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.007
What, you think those streets
out there are slick

02:54.041 --> 02:55.609
just from booze
and vomit?

02:55.643 --> 02:57.044
Unh-unh.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.012
In my heart, I've always
lived here in New Orleans.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.916
It just took actually moving
here for me to realize that.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.152
Uribe is gonna miss
New Orleans.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.689
Especially
my lady friend Polly.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.857
Jesus, again with her?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.059
She's a Classics professor
from Tulane.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.895
I've never heard you go on
like this about a woman, Pedro.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.965
Oh, you've never met
anybody like her, man.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.434
Did you know that she's doing
the new translation

03:20.468 --> 03:22.202
of the "Iliad"?

03:24.037 --> 03:29.843
That ass, man, that claps
like, bah, bah, bah!

03:29.877 --> 03:33.781
And she believes in
a non-monogamy lifestyle.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.816
Really? We never did finish
that four-way

03:35.849 --> 03:37.451
that we started back
in Morristown.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.288
You know what can make this
dream come true is Twitter.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.022
We love Twitterers.

03:42.055 --> 03:47.728
"Who wants to have sex
with me

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
and my best friend,

03:49.563 --> 03:52.700
hashtag Brockmire,
hashtag..."

03:54.468 --> 03:56.870
"Hashtag four-way."

04:01.842 --> 04:04.778
Whoo!
I just got to catch my breath.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.548
Just...just a quick second here.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.849
Me, too, man.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.719
Uribe went down on the big
one for so long,

04:11.752 --> 04:13.687
I started to pass out.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.923
Then Uribe start thinking
about my kids.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.991
And I was like, no,
no, no, no, no.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.226
You're not gonna die
like this, man.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.994
Get up.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.262
Thought about your kids

04:22.296 --> 04:24.164
when you were going down
on a woman, did you?

04:24.197 --> 04:26.567
Well, it's like my --
my "me" time to think.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.201
I just go blank.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.604
I get lost in a sea
of blackness and warmth.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.340
It's like going back
into the womb.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.240
That's deep, man.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.744
Viagra.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.579
Yeah, Goddamn Viagra.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.947
That's my bad.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.415
We shouldn't have taken
three, Goddamn it.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.116
I just didn't want us
to embarrass ourselves.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.285
They were so young
and fricking eager.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.154
Well, we did it, man.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.290
You think they've even
realized that we're gone?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.459
My God.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.594
Orgies are officially
a young man's game.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.162
So is baseball, man.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.731
I cannot hit it
like I used to.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.166
I cannot hit it
like I used to.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.968
We getting too old
for this shit?

05:01.001 --> 05:04.472
I mean, that jack-ass Raj
was still swimming around

05:04.505 --> 05:05.839
in his daddy's balls

05:05.873 --> 05:08.108
when I was halfway done
with my career.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.910
But he just passed me
by like

05:09.943 --> 05:11.979
I was some kind of
a meth-head hitchhiking

05:12.012 --> 05:13.681
by the side of the road.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.915
Oh, yeah, papi.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.118
Our best years
are behind us, mi amigo.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.253
I just -- I can't accept
the fact that it's over.

05:20.287 --> 05:23.524
I mean, who are we
if we're not baseball men?

05:23.557 --> 05:27.294
Now, I can't bat.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.297
I can't field.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.600
I can't throw.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.767
Except for
the knuckleball, man.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.903
Uribe's got
a killer knuckleball.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.038
Bullshit,
killer knuckleball.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.773
I saw you fingering
that groupie up there.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.742
You've got an arm
like spaghetti, that's
what you've got.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.911
Knuckleball is not
about strength, man.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.746
It's about
pushing the ball

05:45.779 --> 05:47.815
from the fingertips
to the mitt.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.249
Well, this I got to see.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.718
Come on, we're going
to the stadium.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.052
I wanna see
this knuckleball.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.988
-Ah, shit.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.624
Well, maybe Charles
is interested.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.791
Charles?

05:57.825 --> 05:59.660
Please leave me alone.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.028
I got to tell you,
I'm impressed

06:01.061 --> 06:02.696
you get any work at all
done around here.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.132
If I couldn't do work in the
same room as people having sex,

06:05.165 --> 06:07.034
we wouldn't have a podcast.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.337
He's right.
We wouldn't.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.339
All right, I got
your number now, Pedro.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.074
Come on, one more.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.144
Holy shit, man.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.946
That thing dropped
like 3 feet.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.549
Pedro, this knuckleball,
this is your ticket back

06:21.582 --> 06:22.816
to the major leagues.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.984
Nah, man.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.086
I had a good run
and it's over.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.422
I'm not gonna go as a joke
in the minors, man.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.458
Let me just talk to the manager.
All right? He owes me a favor.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.593
Let me see
what I can do here.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.430
Pedro, just don't leave.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.832
Please.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.401
You know what, man?
Let's talk to him.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.704
Well, they're not gonna be here
for a couple of hours yet.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.405
But I do know
this lovely little bar

06:45.439 --> 06:47.274
with a terrific
sunrise happy hour.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.642
Brockmire?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.210
Man, that hurts.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.245
Oh, shit, that's
a very good point.

06:52.279 --> 06:55.048
We should probably knock out
these boners.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.850
All right, you take right field,
I'll take left field.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.385
Whoa, whoa, Brockmire?

06:58.418 --> 07:02.155
Don't be a bitch, man.
On the mound, back-to-back.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.492
-No.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.360
Brockmire just trying
to find a rhythm.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.863
Trying not to be distracted
by the strange noises

07:09.897 --> 07:12.733
coming from
Pedro Uribe.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.134
What are you doing there?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.136
I -- I can't hear
myself whack.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.573
-Oh! That was fast.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.008
My goodness.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.011
The man
knows what he likes.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.214
Brockmire still
struggling mightily.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.950
Well, don't grip me.
I'll never get this done.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.854
Let me get
this straight.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.023
You show up to my field
 smelling like piss...

07:36.056 --> 07:37.257
Not my piss.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.259
I sat in somebody else's
piss at the bar.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.595
...expecting a favor?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.063
Eat shit, Brockmire.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.365
Leland, you had sex with
my wife back in Kansas City.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.800
Now, I don't care about that.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.301
You're on a long list.
It's a real short life.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.403
But you know who might care,

07:50.437 --> 07:53.607
is your lovely
and charming wife, Doreen.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.775
You're blackmailing me.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.343
No, douchebag.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.311
I'm just trying to use leverage
to get you to witness

07:58.345 --> 08:00.247
this tremendous display
of athleticism.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.116
You will not be sorry.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.387
Jesus,
he looks like shit.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.923
Yeah, well, so does Mami
in the morning.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.324
Just watch!

08:11.358 --> 08:13.460
All right,
now, you got this.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.028
Uribe feel like
a joke, man.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.730
No, no, that's the Viagra
come-down talking.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.666
Then why is the mascot
making fun of me?

08:18.699 --> 08:21.268
Don't pay any attention
to that thing, all right.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.670
There's not even
a human being in there.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.738
It's just a golem
that formed itself

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
out of shit and bile.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.808
Now, come on.
We are right where we belong.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.076
We are baseball men.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.679
Let's go.

08:31.712 --> 08:36.817
**

08:36.850 --> 08:40.120
How is Doreen, anyway?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.354
She's fine.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.625
She still into those
Hummel figurines?

08:44.658 --> 08:49.396
**

08:49.429 --> 08:50.764
Oh, ho ho.

08:50.798 --> 08:54.101
**

08:54.134 --> 08:55.769
Damn!
That was a nice one.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.372
It drops like three feet.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.909
**

09:01.942 --> 09:03.343
Yeah!

09:03.376 --> 09:05.846
So there's
an open roster spot,

09:05.879 --> 09:08.115
since Peplowski's
on paternity.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.584
I'll talk to the GM,
but I think

09:10.618 --> 09:12.686
it makes sense for us
to give you a shot.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.788
Yeah, Daddy!
Yes!

09:14.822 --> 09:16.724
Thank you, Leland.
Yeah!

09:16.757 --> 09:19.126
Goddamn it, what is this?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
Somebody squirted goop
all over the mound.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.362
-Oh.
-Oh, wow.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.397
Like, probably just rub it
in there with your shoe.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.899
-Ugh.
-Yeah, get -- get it

09:25.933 --> 09:27.567
on your shoe real good.
-Hey!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.304
Got to find
my knuckleball, Charles.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.106
I got
to find the magic trick

09:33.140 --> 09:34.908
that's gonna
keep me in the game.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.309
Now, Pedro was easy.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.279
His knuckleball was --
well, it was a knuckleball.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.481
Mine's gonna be harder
to find, but that's all right.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.416
Got an encyclopedic
knowledge of the game

09:43.450 --> 09:45.152
and a nearly
photographic memory.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.454
If anybody can do this,
anybody at all...

09:47.487 --> 09:48.722
Charles:
I figured it out.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.357
Thank you, God,
'cause I had nothing.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.692
According
to Whitney's numbers,

09:51.725 --> 09:55.162
everyone prefers Raj
to you across all demos.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.529
All demos?
Really?

09:56.563 --> 09:59.599
So, elderly Korean ladies,
they

09:59.633 --> 10:01.134
Nearly 2-to-1.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.470
Except from the eighth
and ninth innings

10:03.503 --> 10:05.472
when they prefer you
to him.

10:05.505 --> 10:06.573
Naturally.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.575
You see, because that is
the culmination

10:08.608 --> 10:10.610
of a narrative that I have --
-Nobody cares about that.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.080
It's when
you're finally drunk.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.614
Two and a half hours
into the game,

10:14.648 --> 10:16.884
those Belgian beers start
kicking in and you're loose.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.151
By banning liquor
in the booth,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.419
they've accidently
taken out

10:19.452 --> 10:21.421
the one thing that
makes you special.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.256
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.592
This polling proves
it scientifically.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.228
You're more likable
when you're drunk.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.997
Those are the words
that in his heart,

10:30.030 --> 10:33.133
every alcoholic
longs to be true.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.936
Well, I still don't see
how this is gonna work.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.505
I mean, if Whitney catches me
drinking in the booth,

10:38.538 --> 10:40.941
she's gonna shit-can me
and I mean in a hurry.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.609
That's why
we start every game

10:42.642 --> 10:44.477
with a tall glass
of iced tea.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.213
Well, Goddamn it, Charles.
We've been over this.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.215
The ice is gonna
water down the rye

10:48.248 --> 10:49.616
and then I might
as well be drinking

10:49.649 --> 10:52.252
blended whiskey like some
kind of a garbage person.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.821
The ice is plastic.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.355
And when you run out of that,
you'll be able to enjoy

10:55.388 --> 10:57.124
the rest of the whiskey
in the booth.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.828
What? I don't see
anything. Where?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.296
Exactly.
It's hidden.

11:03.330 --> 11:07.134
Here.
Give this a try.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.271
Ooh.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.140
The snozzberries taste
like snozzberries.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.908
Yeah.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.576
Ooh.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.045
Jim:
Oh, look at that young man.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
My goodness,
children are adorable.

11:19.947 --> 11:23.016
They're just like tiny,
little dumb people, aren't they?

11:23.050 --> 11:26.319
They are.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.788
I'm gonna go out on a limb,

11:27.821 --> 11:29.990
I'm gonna say something
a little controversial,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.792
I find children amusing.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.193
Sue me, go ahead, folks.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.262
Causewell slashes one foul.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.696
Oh, that hit a bird

11:36.730 --> 11:39.399
and it bounces
back into fair territory.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.901
Oh, I got to --

11:40.934 --> 11:42.803
I got to check the rule book
on this one, folks.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.142
That's fair ball, fair ball.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.713
Oh, they got me
on the dance cam.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.116
Ho-ho.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.954
**

12:00.988 --> 12:02.722
Whoo!
Oh!

12:06.860 --> 12:10.130
This last week
has been impressive.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.834
You really shucked and jived
your way back into things.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.202
Congrats.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.669
Well...

12:16.703 --> 12:19.172
I couldn't have done it
without the help of...

12:19.206 --> 12:20.440
well,
my own good instincts.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.609
-You are such a dick.
-Shush.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.577
You and Raj
are neck-and-neck,

12:24.611 --> 12:27.214
so I think the best way
to see who pulls ahead

12:27.247 --> 12:30.583
is to have you call
a game together.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.119
Oh, I don't do
a two-man booth.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.922
You do now.
Raj?!

12:34.955 --> 12:36.156
Oh, yeah!

12:36.189 --> 12:39.259
Player two has
entered the game!

12:39.292 --> 12:43.363
-That's funny.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.766
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.
This is a nervous tick.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.636
And I'm feeling...

12:49.669 --> 12:52.305
very...

12:54.174 --> 12:55.909
...nervous.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.250
I don't like this.
It's gross and dangerous.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.085
Yeah, well, so am I.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.353
Look,
it's the only way, okay?

13:06.386 --> 13:09.356
I have to be drunk
and Raj will catch me

13:09.389 --> 13:12.125
if I try to sneak
anything in the booth.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.360
All right, well,
I soaked this tampon

13:13.393 --> 13:15.095
with enough rye
to get you drunk,

13:15.128 --> 13:17.364
but not to kill you...
I think.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.932
Math was never
my strongest subject.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.101
I don't know how much you weigh
and let's not forget,

13:21.134 --> 13:22.569
I'm a high school dropout.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.971
Better be the good stuff,
Charles,

13:24.004 --> 13:25.839
'cause my asshole,
it can tell the difference.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.374
Wait, maybe we should
go to the bathroom.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.277
And it's in.
-I have lived a life, my friend.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.544
Now, how long do you suppose
before this

13:31.578 --> 13:34.414
takes effect, because...?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.221
Ooh!

13:41.254 --> 13:42.789
Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:42.822 --> 13:44.491
No, no, it's good.
It's good, it's good.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.859
Mmm!

13:45.893 --> 13:47.594
Oh, yeah.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.662
Oh, that's good stuff.
-Let's...

13:49.696 --> 13:51.932
-No, no, I need a minute.
-Okay.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.833
I'll catch up.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.936
Ooh-hoo!

13:55.969 --> 13:57.905
All right, it's gonna be
a good day.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.873
I think maybe we should set
some ground rules

13:59.907 --> 14:01.141
before the game starts.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.375
-That's such a good idea.
-It'll make things easier.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.245
Charles?

14:05.278 --> 14:08.115
Chuck, my man,
what is this?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.516
Those are ground rules.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.584
Okay.
Let's see...

14:11.618 --> 14:13.620
"Alternate innings,"
great.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.924
"Raj is prohibited
from pandering."

14:16.957 --> 14:18.225
What's that mean?

14:18.258 --> 14:21.328
It means, none of this
best fans in baseball shit.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.462
That's not pandering.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.397
These fans have been
great to me.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.466
I like them.
I like people.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.700
-Mm-hmm.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.903
Really? Boy, I think
I liked you better

14:29.937 --> 14:32.005
when I thought you were
a fake piece of shit.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.507
No, 'cause now I see that
you're an actual piece of shit.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.809
-Right.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.545
'Cause every stranger's
just some asshole

14:38.578 --> 14:39.913
you haven't met yet, son.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.248
Just remember that.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.186
Because I bring the best
out in them.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.554
Oh.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.821
And near as I can tell,
that is a valuable skill

14:48.855 --> 14:50.523
to have for a uniquely
attractive person

14:50.557 --> 14:51.959
who's good on TV.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.061
You see, I'm not
gonna stop with baseball.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.329
I'm not even gonna
stop with sports.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.665
I am constructing
a media empire

14:58.698 --> 15:01.668
built on sincerity
and affability.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.637
In 10 years,
I will be everywhere.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.607
Holy shit,
I've met you before.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.510
You're a brown Joe Buck.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.611
Ha ha ha. No.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.647
Joe Buck is a white me.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.051
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen!

15:18.085 --> 15:21.021
I'm Raj Datt joined
by Jim Brockmire here

15:21.054 --> 15:24.157
on this beautiful
summer afternoon,

15:24.191 --> 15:27.961
to bring you baseball.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.796
Tough day for Tisdale,

15:29.829 --> 15:33.333
as he's on the hook
for all 12 runs.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.934
-I'm thirsty.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.505
And mercifully, Leland is
bringing in a new pitcher,

15:38.538 --> 15:43.443
number 69, Pedro Uribe.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.745
Pedro "The Grand Slam King"
Uribe,

15:45.778 --> 15:49.349
is mounting a comeback
as a knuckleball pitcher

15:49.382 --> 15:52.585
at the tender age of 33,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.455
which is an obvious lie.

15:57.857 --> 16:02.729
Uribe inherits a 1-0 count
from Tisdale.

16:02.762 --> 16:06.699
Ooh, that one
got away from him.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.409
Easy take there
and that's a walk for Uribe.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.378
An inauspicious start
for the veteran.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.812
Hearly up to the plate.

16:19.846 --> 16:23.650
Come on, Pedro.
You got this, man.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.059
Wow.
Okay.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.660
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

16:33.693 --> 16:35.828
and just call that
one a wild pitch.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.698
Leland is approaching
the mound to chat with Uribe

16:38.731 --> 16:43.036
and this comeback might be
over before it's begun.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.404
Excuse me, buddy.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.938
I know this is your inning
and everything, but that --

16:45.972 --> 16:47.574
that happens to be
my friend down there,

16:47.607 --> 16:49.142
so what say we just put
our differences aside

16:49.176 --> 16:51.478
and try to make this the most
professional broadcast

16:51.511 --> 16:52.979
that we can?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.547
That's what I've been saying
since the be

16:54.581 --> 16:56.316
Whatever.
I got you.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.584
Jim, you knew Uribe

16:57.617 --> 16:59.652
from your time together
in Morristown.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.621
What do you think is going
through his head right now?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.323
Well, I think he has
the weight of the world

17:03.356 --> 17:05.125
on his shoulders.
It's just a random inning

17:05.157 --> 17:06.726
in the middle
of a very long season,

17:06.759 --> 17:08.161
but for Pedro Uribe,

17:08.194 --> 17:10.829
this is the most important
pitch of his life.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.965
See, he's just a farm boy
from the Dominican Republic,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.035
who right now,
is hanging onto the game

17:16.069 --> 17:18.338
by the very fingernails
that he uses to throw

17:18.371 --> 17:19.739
that knuckleball
down there.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.009
Jim, what do you think
has been Uribe's issue so far?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.711
You know, Raj,
it could be nothing.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.213
I mean, the truth is,
a knuckleball pitcher

17:26.246 --> 17:28.781
has very little control
over where the ball goes.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.283
There's no spin
on the pitch.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.785
Its movement is determined
by random air currents

17:32.819 --> 17:34.354
blowing the ball
this way and that.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.688
Its final location is often

17:35.722 --> 17:37.357
as much a surprise
to the pitcher

17:37.390 --> 17:40.026
as it is to the batter,
thus by its very nature,

17:40.059 --> 17:41.894
every single
knuckleball thrown

17:41.928 --> 17:44.164
is just an act
of pure hope and, boy,

17:44.197 --> 17:45.965
this next one is
no exception, folks.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.569
Ooh. All right, well,
let's see what he's got.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.605
**

17:59.212 --> 18:02.215
**

18:08.555 --> 18:09.822
Strike one.

18:09.856 --> 18:13.760
And Uribe might've
finally found something.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.397
Oh!
Strike two!

18:17.430 --> 18:20.500
-Strike three!
-Whoo!

18:20.533 --> 18:22.702
And Uribe comes back
on Hearly to strike him

18:22.735 --> 18:25.972
out on three of the nastiest
pitches you will ever see.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.575
Still a little life left
in the old farm boy, eh, Raj?

18:28.608 --> 18:31.411
You're telling me.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.547
Yeah! Ha ha!

18:34.581 --> 18:38.084
My goodness.
My goodness.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.687
Well, it's not every crowd
that gives a standing ovation

18:40.720 --> 18:42.689
after
an eight-run home loss,

18:42.722 --> 18:44.791
but that is the kind of
pitching performance

18:44.824 --> 18:47.694
that Pedro Uribe
has put on here today.

18:47.727 --> 18:51.531
6 innings, 12 strike-outs,
no runs.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.533
Raj, take us home.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.701
My pleasure.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.969
That's Jim Brockmire,
I'm Raj Datt,

18:57.003 --> 19:00.973
and you are the best fans
in baseball.

19:04.010 --> 19:04.977
Brockmire.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.112
Hey.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.148
You feel good?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.483
Ohh!
Papi...

19:10.517 --> 19:12.885
I wanna thank you for pushing
me to do this, man.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.053
Oh...

19:14.086 --> 19:16.155
It is the perfect way
to leave on top.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.357
Where are you going?

19:17.390 --> 19:19.226
After what you just
showed out there,

19:19.259 --> 19:20.126
it's only a matter of time

19:20.159 --> 19:21.728
before you're back
in the bigs.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.564
Papi, Uribe already been
to the big league, man.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.400
Pero mi amor, Polly,
man, that's new.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.969
And who knows if that
will ever happen again.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.572
See, a choice between
love and work

19:32.605 --> 19:34.207
is not
a choice at all, man.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.575
It's not.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.644
So Uribe is gonna
go with her

19:37.677 --> 19:39.679
to her fellowship
at Cornell.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.214
Are you serious?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.382
It takes a real man

19:42.415 --> 19:44.617
to love a smart and strong
woman like her.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.987
Uribe is the realist
that have ever lived.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.257
That's true, that's true.
But co-- Wait.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.891
Just, no, wait a second.
-Okay, papi.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.694
I'm going to
miss you, man.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.663
But I got to do this.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.734
Thank you, man.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.970
Thank you.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.639
-Man.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.874
Oh.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.142
Polly.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.723
Hi.
I know.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.926
Just, please,
let me talk.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.861
Jules, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.831
I -- I left because I was
selfish and I was stupid

20:31.864 --> 20:34.801
and I had absolutely no idea
what I was giving up.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.704
The thing is, I'm lonely
all of the time now.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.806
I mean, I never used
to get lonely.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.674
I don't think I realized
how good my life could be

20:41.708 --> 20:43.910
until you were in it.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.314
Jules, I know
I don't deserve it.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.848
Please give me
another chance, please.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.351
I need you in my life.
Please.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.786
Let me -- let me show you
how good that I can be.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.593
Okay,
can you back up a bit?

21:00.627 --> 21:01.694
To which part?

21:01.728 --> 21:03.763
No, I mean, back up.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.433
You mean like...?

21:11.638 --> 21:15.241
You know, I had to pay
for a second airline ticket

21:15.274 --> 21:17.744
to bring this
basket with me!

21:19.679 --> 21:22.048
Enjoy.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.120
Stupid dog!
Shut up!
