01:14.451 --> 01:16.328
<i>The future.</i>

01:16.411 --> 01:19.831
<i>A dark, desolate world.</i>

01:25.712 --> 01:31.009
<i>A world of war,</i>
<i>suffering, loss...</i>

01:31.301 --> 01:33.220
<i>on both sides.</i>

01:34.346 --> 01:38.809
<i>Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.</i>

01:42.229 --> 01:46.441
<i>Fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat.</i>

02:13.302 --> 02:16.221
<i>Are we</i>
<i>destined down this path?</i>

02:16.596 --> 02:21.768
<i>Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species
before us?</i>

02:25.397 --> 02:29.151
<i>Or can we evolve
fast enough to
change ourselves?</i>

02:29.776 --> 02:31.153
<i>Change our fate?</i>

02:37.367 --> 02:40.746
<i>Is the future truly set?</i>

04:10.210 --> 04:11.253
They're here!

04:17.007 --> 04:18.051
Time's up.

04:18.176 --> 04:19.219
Sentinels!

04:23.431 --> 04:24.474
Sunspot!

04:29.437 --> 04:30.564
Let's go.

05:19.529 --> 05:20.822
Run!

05:22.532 --> 05:23.533
Go!

07:04.259 --> 07:06.011
Blink! No!

07:53.183 --> 07:54.601
Too late, assholes.

08:14.204 --> 08:15.747
Don't move,
you mutant scum!

08:19.459 --> 08:20.627
No!

08:22.003 --> 08:24.214
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

08:29.135 --> 08:31.763
<i>So few of us left.</i>

08:35.140 --> 08:36.183
<i>Professor?</i>

08:37.477 --> 08:38.727
I've found them.

10:11.029 --> 10:12.155
Professor!

10:14.199 --> 10:15.408
Bobby.
Hey, Storm.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.577
Hey, kid.

10:18.578 --> 10:21.122
Professor,
you made it.

10:43.853 --> 10:46.814
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

10:47.482 --> 10:49.317
then I send Bishop
back to warn us

10:49.400 --> 10:50.902
of the attack
before it happens.

10:51.569 --> 10:53.863
Blink scouts
the next site...

10:54.614 --> 10:56.950
and then we leave
before they ever
know we were there.

10:57.116 --> 10:59.744
Because...
we never were.

10:59.911 --> 11:01.746
What do you mean
you were never there?

11:01.913 --> 11:03.331
She projects
Bishop back in time

11:03.414 --> 11:04.958
a few days to
warn the others...

11:05.124 --> 11:06.751
of the coming attack.

11:06.918 --> 11:09.045
So she sends
Bishop back in time?

11:09.170 --> 11:11.839
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

11:12.006 --> 11:13.258
His younger body.

11:14.050 --> 11:15.218
Wow.

11:15.927 --> 11:19.013
This might just work,
Charles.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.307
What might work?

11:22.767 --> 11:27.105
The Sentinel program was
originally conceived by
Doctor Bolivar Trask.

11:27.438 --> 11:31.901
In the early '70s,
he was one of the world's
leading weapons designers.

11:32.151 --> 11:36.364
<i>But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...</i>

11:36.531 --> 11:39.701
<i>using their gifts
to fuel his own research.</i>

11:39.867 --> 11:41.244
This is extraordinary.

11:41.411 --> 11:44.622
<i>There was one</i>
<i>mutant who had discovered</i>
<i>what he was doing.</i>

11:44.914 --> 11:49.627
A mutant with the ability
to transform
herself into anyone.

11:50.128 --> 11:51.546
Mystique.

11:52.422 --> 11:54.507
<i>I knew her as Raven.</i>

11:54.716 --> 11:56.134
We met when
we were children,

11:56.217 --> 11:58.052
grew up together.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.722
She was like
a sister to me.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.765
I tried to help her...

12:02.932 --> 12:06.477
but only succeeded
in driving her away.

12:07.186 --> 12:10.064
She hunted Trask
across the world.

12:10.398 --> 12:13.693
And at the Paris
Peace Accords in 1973,

12:13.776 --> 12:15.028
<i>after the Vietnam War...</i>

12:15.862 --> 12:17.238
<i>she found Trask...</i>

12:20.325 --> 12:21.868
and killed him.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.751
<i>It was the first
time she killed.</i>

12:29.876 --> 12:31.461
It wasn't her last.

12:31.627 --> 12:35.381
But killing Trask
did not have the
outcome she expected.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.300
It only persuaded
the government

12:37.383 --> 12:39.552
of the need
for his program.

12:39.761 --> 12:41.929
They
captured her that day...

12:42.096 --> 12:44.891
tortured her,
experimented on her.

12:46.017 --> 12:50.438
<i>In her DNA, they discovered
the secrets to her powers
of transformation.</i>

12:50.605 --> 12:52.648
<i>It gave them the key
they needed...</i>

12:52.774 --> 12:56.778
<i>to create weapons
that could adapt
to any mutant power.</i>

12:57.236 --> 12:59.197
<i>And in less than 50 years...</i>

12:59.364 --> 13:01.532
<i>the machines
that have destroyed...</i>

13:01.657 --> 13:04.619
<i>so many of our kind</i>
<i>were created.</i>

13:05.536 --> 13:09.248
But it all started
that day in 1973...

13:09.707 --> 13:11.125
the day she first killed.

13:11.376 --> 13:13.336
The day she truly became...

13:13.461 --> 13:14.879
Mystique.

13:16.923 --> 13:18.299
You want to go back there.

13:18.466 --> 13:21.761
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

13:21.886 --> 13:23.304
keep her out of
their hands...

13:23.429 --> 13:26.891
then we can stop
the Sentinels from
ever being born.

13:27.016 --> 13:30.228
And end this war
before it ever begins.

13:34.524 --> 13:37.318
Uh, I can send someone back
a couple weeks.

13:37.944 --> 13:39.237
Maybe a month.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.573
But you're talking about
going back decades.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.576
You have the most
powerful brain in the world,
Professor...

13:46.285 --> 13:49.914
but the mind
can only stretch so far
before it snaps.

13:50.456 --> 13:53.543
It would rip you apart.
I'm sorry.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.878
No one could
survive that trip.

13:56.254 --> 13:59.257
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

14:00.800 --> 14:03.428
What if someone can heal
as fast as they're
ripped apart?

14:03.511 --> 14:04.595
It's a risk.

14:04.679 --> 14:05.930
Yeah, I'm getting that.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.723
Not just for you.

14:07.807 --> 14:10.184
You do this,
you change history.

14:10.268 --> 14:11.436
Well, that's kind of
the point.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.771
Some of us could be killed.

14:13.855 --> 14:16.065
Some of us may
never be born.

14:16.149 --> 14:18.484
We have no idea
how things may change.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.528
We could keep going.

14:20.695 --> 14:22.238
Keep fighting.

14:22.447 --> 14:23.614
Until what?

14:25.158 --> 14:27.660
You've got a
decision to make.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.787
You can keep sending
Bishop back in time

14:29.871 --> 14:31.914
over and over again
to warn you,

14:31.998 --> 14:36.043
until one day,
he doesn't make it,
and you all die.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.045
Or you can
give up this life.

14:38.129 --> 14:40.798
So that they
and everyone else
who died in this war

14:40.882 --> 14:42.884
can actually have a future.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.428
You're asking us
to sacrifice our lives

14:45.511 --> 14:47.597
for a future we might not
even be a part of.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.973
Yes.

14:49.307 --> 14:51.017
A second chance.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.437
A better chance
for everyone.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.319
My people need to vote.

15:05.031 --> 15:06.574
They just did.

15:07.825 --> 15:09.035
They're in.

15:27.345 --> 15:28.679
Okay, spread out.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.015
Take your positions.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.573
So I wake up
in my younger body,
God knows where.

15:47.657 --> 15:48.866
Then what?

15:49.033 --> 15:52.036
You'll need to go to
my house and find me.

15:52.203 --> 15:54.789
Convince me of all of this.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.582
Won't you be able to
just read my mind?

15:56.707 --> 15:59.877
I didn't have my
powers in 1973.

16:00.211 --> 16:04.382
Logan, you're going to
have to do for me
what I once did for you.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.343
Lead me, guide me.

16:07.677 --> 16:09.971
I was a very
different man then.

16:10.096 --> 16:12.265
You'll have to be
patient with me.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.560
Patience is
my strongest suit.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.895
You'll need me as well.
What?

16:18.062 --> 16:20.815
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

16:20.898 --> 16:24.026
and I set her on
a dangerous path.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.653
A darker path.

16:25.736 --> 16:28.406
It's going to take
the two of us,
side by side...

16:28.489 --> 16:31.200
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

16:34.579 --> 16:35.913
Great.

16:36.664 --> 16:38.416
So where do I find you?

16:38.749 --> 16:40.251
Well, it's complicated.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.796
Are you sure about this?

16:45.423 --> 16:47.008
It's not just his power
that'll be tested.

16:47.091 --> 16:49.218
I've seen what this
can do to you.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.762
I can handle this.

16:52.263 --> 16:53.764
Trust me.

16:56.309 --> 16:58.644
I guess I'll see you
in the next life.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.161
Basically, your
body will go to sleep

17:15.243 --> 17:17.622
while your mind travels
back in time.

17:17.704 --> 17:22.001
As long as you're back there,
past and present
will continue to coexist.

17:22.460 --> 17:23.794
But once you wake up...

17:25.128 --> 17:27.839
whatever you've done
will take hold
and become history.

17:28.132 --> 17:31.052
And for the rest of us,
it will be the only history
that we know.

17:31.135 --> 17:34.513
It will be like
the last 50 years
never happened.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.183
And this world,
and this war...

17:37.350 --> 17:40.728
the only person who will
remember it is you.

17:42.605 --> 17:43.606
All right, Logan...

17:43.689 --> 17:45.316
I need you to
clear your head

17:45.399 --> 17:46.901
and to stay
as calm as possible.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.486
What? What do you mean?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.946
If your mind gets rocky,
it will be harder for me
to hold you...

17:51.030 --> 17:53.407
and you could start
to slip between
past and future.

17:53.491 --> 17:55.493
What if I need to get
a little rocky?

17:56.619 --> 17:57.912
Think peaceful thoughts?

17:57.995 --> 18:00.915
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

18:01.082 --> 18:04.919
Well, you don't really age,
so you'll pretty much
look the same.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.922
You won't have
much time in the past.

18:08.089 --> 18:09.632
The Sentinels will find us.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.050
They always do.

18:11.217 --> 18:12.843
And this time,
we won't be able to run.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.553
We'll have no escape.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.890
This is our last chance.

18:18.349 --> 18:22.186
You really think
this will work?
I have faith in him.

18:22.353 --> 18:24.230
It's not him I'm
worried about, it's us.

18:24.355 --> 18:25.856
We were young...

18:25.940 --> 18:27.525
we didn't know any better.

18:28.526 --> 18:31.028
We will now.

18:32.071 --> 18:33.406
See you all soon.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.575
This might sting a little.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.960
<i>The first time</i>

19:30.754 --> 19:34.175
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

19:35.634 --> 19:36.844
Whoa.

19:41.056 --> 19:45.352
<i>I thought the sun</i>

19:46.896 --> 19:47.938
<i>Rose in your eyes</i>

19:58.073 --> 20:03.621
<i>And the moon
and the stars</i>

20:07.041 --> 20:11.545
<i>Were the gifts you gave</i>

20:11.629 --> 20:13.088
Holy shit.

20:21.055 --> 20:22.765
It worked.

20:27.311 --> 20:28.562
Hey, what's going on?

20:28.646 --> 20:30.773
- Gwen, get dressed.
- Who the hell are you?

20:30.856 --> 20:31.982
Hey, I don't know
what's going on.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.400
You're supposed to be

20:33.484 --> 20:34.693
guarding the boss's daughter,
not screwing her.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.695
Well, I didn't
sleep with her.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.489
No?
No.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.909
I mean, yes, I slept
with her many times.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.244
Jimmy!

20:43.327 --> 20:45.829
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

20:45.913 --> 20:48.582
I just got here
20 seconds ago.

20:48.666 --> 20:49.667
Really?

20:49.750 --> 20:50.751
Then what happened
to your clothes?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.378
My... Oh.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.421
Would you believe
me if I told you

20:54.505 --> 20:56.006
I was sent here
from the future?

20:56.131 --> 20:57.508
Huh?

20:58.842 --> 21:00.344
Get out of here,
sweetheart.
Yeah.

21:00.386 --> 21:02.263
We're gonna take
care of this comedian.
No, you're not.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.557
You're gonna give me
the keys to your car and
some money for gas...

21:04.682 --> 21:05.849
or you're gonna wake
up in the hospital.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.726
Trust me,
I know how these
things play out.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.436
Oh. Because you're
from the future?

21:09.520 --> 21:10.563
No.

21:11.105 --> 21:12.356
Because of these.

21:14.692 --> 21:16.151
What the hell?

21:20.114 --> 21:22.783
God damn it!

21:46.765 --> 21:48.684
Peaceful thoughts.

22:06.577 --> 22:09.038
Jimmy! What happened
to Ramon?

22:09.288 --> 22:11.290
And why are you
talking crazy talk?

22:11.373 --> 22:12.750
Look, uh...
Gwen.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.586
Gwen, you're gonna wanna
lay low for a few days,
all right?

22:15.669 --> 22:17.087
Starting now.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.172
Come on, out.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.257
Go.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.434
Hmm.

22:32.353 --> 22:36.106
<i>Today, the 18th MP Brigade</i>
<i>is departing from Saigon,</i>

22:36.190 --> 22:39.151
<i>marking the
last American troops
to leave Vietnam.</i>

22:39.234 --> 22:41.904
<i>and effectively
ending the war.</i>

22:44.406 --> 22:47.034
We are reviewing all of our
defense expenditures...

22:47.201 --> 22:49.244
and all the black books
are being opened.

22:49.411 --> 22:53.207
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

22:53.457 --> 22:54.917
If these mutants,
as you describe...

22:55.459 --> 22:57.419
are already
living among us...

22:57.586 --> 22:59.421
then they are living
here peacefully.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.173
We haven't
had an incident
in over 10 years.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.591
After what happened
in Cuba?

23:02.716 --> 23:04.051
That was
never confirmed.

23:04.218 --> 23:06.428
We have very real
enemies out there...

23:06.595 --> 23:07.930
the Russians, the Chinese.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.100
We are talking about
a tenth of a tenth...

23:11.266 --> 23:13.310
of a tenth
of our population.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.813
Allow me to read
something to you.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.022
Please.

23:17.106 --> 23:19.983
This was acquired by
our friends at the CIA.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.402
It's a dissertation...

23:21.485 --> 23:25.239
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.408
And I quote...

23:27.866 --> 23:29.743
"To Homo Neanderthalensis...

23:29.910 --> 23:32.121
"his mutant cousin,
Homo Sapiens..."

23:32.579 --> 23:33.914
which is us...

23:34.081 --> 23:36.083
"was an aberration.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.378
"The arrival of the mutated
human species, Homo Sapiens...

23:39.545 --> 23:43.882
"was followed by
the immediate extinction
of their less evolved kin."

23:44.508 --> 23:45.509
Well...

23:46.093 --> 23:50.514
Now, we are
the Neanderthal.

23:50.681 --> 23:52.433
Speak for yourself,
Dr. Trask.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.312
You know,
when you sent our
soldiers to Vietnam...

23:57.479 --> 23:59.106
without the weapons they
needed to win the war...

23:59.273 --> 24:01.191
you underestimated
your enemy.

24:01.316 --> 24:04.653
You do that
with this enemy...

24:04.737 --> 24:05.904
Mmm...

24:05.988 --> 24:08.991
and it won't be
some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

24:09.158 --> 24:11.326
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

24:11.493 --> 24:13.704
our cities, our homes...

24:13.871 --> 24:17.916
and by the time
you see the need
for my program...

24:18.250 --> 24:20.377
it will be too late...

24:20.544 --> 24:25.174
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.220
We are sorry,
Dr. Trask...

24:30.637 --> 24:32.973
but your
Sentinel Program...

24:33.599 --> 24:35.601
it ain't gonna fly.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.364
Can I help you, Colonel?

24:49.448 --> 24:51.742
Just here to give our
boys a proper send-off.

24:51.867 --> 24:55.204
I'm sorry, sir,
but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

24:55.370 --> 24:57.372
Stand aside, soldier.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.416
That's an order.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.551
Atten-hut!

25:10.552 --> 25:11.637
At ease.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.328
What is all this?

25:36.411 --> 25:37.996
Lab reports,
blood tests.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.832
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.041
Where is it going?

25:41.124 --> 25:42.167
Same place they are.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.253
Trask Industries.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.381
Let's go, gentlemen.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.758
I'm taking you out
of this shit show.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.760
Shipping home?

25:52.803 --> 25:53.971
Not just yet.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.181
What are you doing
with those?

25:56.265 --> 25:58.058
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.644
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

26:01.270 --> 26:03.146
where we can run
a few more tests.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.195
Your men
are not military.

26:11.530 --> 26:12.531
Private outfit.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.491
We're authorized
to remand these men.

26:14.700 --> 26:15.701
Hmm.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.873
These troops
are going home.

26:21.039 --> 26:25.043
Well, Colonel,
I don't believe you have
jurisdiction in this matter.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.297
I'm afraid I do, son.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.590
I'm sorry, who are you?

26:30.215 --> 26:31.884
The question is,
Major...

26:36.138 --> 26:37.139
...who are you?

27:22.559 --> 27:23.644
Raven!

27:24.061 --> 27:25.437
That's not my name.

27:31.026 --> 27:33.028
I had that.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.279
I know.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.075
Let's move out.
Come on, let's go.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.409
Where's Erik?

27:39.576 --> 27:40.661
I'm on my own now.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.415
Let's go! Move it!

28:04.184 --> 28:05.727
Hold that plane!

28:06.228 --> 28:09.064
Wouldn't wanna
leave these boys in this
godforsaken country.

28:09.231 --> 28:10.232
Yes, sir.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.776
You're not coming
with us, are you?

28:13.235 --> 28:14.611
My war's not over.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.321
The enemy is
still out there.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.513
The four privates,
where did they go?

28:41.680 --> 28:43.515
They were headed
towards the tarmac.

29:42.282 --> 29:43.658
Can I help you?

29:44.076 --> 29:46.536
Uh... Yeah,
what happened
to the school?

29:46.703 --> 29:49.664
The school's
been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

29:49.748 --> 29:52.459
I sure as hell
hope not. Who are you?

29:52.667 --> 29:54.669
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.838
I look after the house now.

29:57.631 --> 29:58.882
You're Beast?

29:58.965 --> 30:01.384
Look at you. I guess
you're a late bloomer.

30:01.510 --> 30:02.636
I don't know what
you're talking about,

30:02.719 --> 30:04.304
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

30:04.554 --> 30:06.139
So where's the Professor?

30:06.223 --> 30:07.474
There's no professor here.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.684
You're pretty strong
for a scrawny kid.

30:09.851 --> 30:12.145
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

30:12.229 --> 30:13.939
No, he's not here.
Come on, Beast.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.482
Come on, Beastie.
No.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.317
Hey!

30:18.860 --> 30:20.070
I said
the school's closed.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.197
You need to leave.
Not until I
see the Professor.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.825
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

30:24.950 --> 30:28.495
Look, kid.
You and I are
gonna be good friends.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.707
You just don't know it yet.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.753
Professor!

30:42.884 --> 30:44.094
Professor!

30:59.151 --> 31:00.777
Hank?

31:00.944 --> 31:02.737
What's going on here?

31:04.072 --> 31:05.240
Professor?

31:05.323 --> 31:06.616
Please don't
call me that.

31:06.741 --> 31:08.243
Why?
You know this guy?

31:08.410 --> 31:10.704
Yeah, he looks
slightly familiar.

31:10.787 --> 31:12.998
Get off the bloody
chandelier, Hank.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.209
You can walk.

31:16.376 --> 31:17.586
You're a perceptive one.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.254
I thought Erik...

31:19.421 --> 31:20.547
Which makes it
slightly perplexing that

31:20.630 --> 31:22.507
you missed our
sign on the way in.

31:22.591 --> 31:23.842
This is private property,
my friend.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.052
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.596
Well.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.598
I'm afraid
I can't do that...

31:32.058 --> 31:33.643
because, uh,
I was sent here for you.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.813
Tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

31:37.731 --> 31:39.024
That's gonna be
a little tricky...

31:39.482 --> 31:42.819
because the person
who sent me was you.

31:42.986 --> 31:43.987
What?

31:44.112 --> 31:45.655
About 50 years from now.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.411
I know. Stay with me.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.997
Like in the future,
50 years from now?
Yeah.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.999
I sent you
from the future?
Yeah.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.709
Piss off.

31:58.919 --> 32:01.504
If you had your powers,
you'd know I was
telling the truth.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.215
How do you know
I don't have my p...

32:04.466 --> 32:06.051
- Who are you?
- I told you.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.594
Are you CIA?
No.

32:07.677 --> 32:08.678
You've been watching me?

32:08.803 --> 32:10.472
I know you, Charles.

32:10.555 --> 32:12.557
We've been friends
for years.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.684
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.562
I know you thought
you were going crazy
when it started...

32:17.729 --> 32:19.773
all the voices
in your head.

32:19.856 --> 32:21.399
And it wasn't
until you were 12...

32:21.483 --> 32:24.986
that you realized
all the voices were in
everyone else's head.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.364
Do you want me to go on?

32:28.531 --> 32:30.033
I never told anyone that.

32:30.116 --> 32:33.745
Not yet, no,
but, you will.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.414
All right,
you've piqued my interest.

32:36.498 --> 32:38.083
What do you want?

32:38.249 --> 32:40.335
We have to stop Raven.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.589
I need your help.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.509
We need your help.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.807
I think I'd like
to wake up now.

32:58.895 --> 33:00.981
What does she
have to do with this?

33:05.193 --> 33:06.861
<i>So you're saying...</i>

33:06.945 --> 33:09.155
they took Raven's
power, and what?

33:09.489 --> 33:11.700
They weaponized it?

33:11.866 --> 33:12.867
Yep.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.078
She is unique.

33:15.245 --> 33:17.163
Yeah, she is, Hank.

33:17.330 --> 33:20.250
In the beginning,
the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.211
Then they began to
identify the genetics
in non-mutants...

33:24.587 --> 33:27.966
who would eventually
have mutant children
and grandchildren.

33:28.508 --> 33:31.511
Many of the humans
tried to help us,
but it was a slaughter.

33:31.928 --> 33:34.681
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge.

33:34.848 --> 33:36.808
I've been in a lot of wars.

33:38.935 --> 33:40.812
I'd never seen
anything like this.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.106
And it all starts
with her.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.650
Let's just say
for the sake of...

33:46.651 --> 33:49.404
the sake, that I
choose to believe you...

33:49.571 --> 33:52.615
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

33:54.784 --> 33:58.705
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.206
I know.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.711
That's why we're
gonna need Magneto, too.

34:05.170 --> 34:07.338
Erik?

34:07.714 --> 34:09.049
- You do know where he is?
- Yeah.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.429
Could you
give me that
one more time, please?

34:15.513 --> 34:16.598
You heard me.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.146
He's where he belongs.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.690
You're just gonna walk out?

34:25.815 --> 34:28.400
Ooh, top marks.
Like I said,
you are perceptive.

34:28.485 --> 34:30.320
The Professor I know
would never turn his back...

34:30.487 --> 34:32.405
on someone who'd
lost their path.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.574
Especially someone he loved.

34:36.993 --> 34:38.328
You know...

34:38.495 --> 34:40.663
I think I do
remember you now.

34:40.830 --> 34:44.876
Yeah. Tall, angry fellow
with the contentious hair.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.879
We came to you
a long time ago...
seeking your help.

34:48.713 --> 34:52.175
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.136
Fuck off.

34:55.637 --> 34:56.888
Listen to me,
you little shit.

34:57.347 --> 35:00.475
I've come a long way,
and I've watched
a lot of people die.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.310
Good people. Friends.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.853
If you're gonna
wallow in self-pity...

35:03.978 --> 35:05.814
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

35:05.897 --> 35:07.565
you understand?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.322
We all have to
die sometime.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.037
Told you there was
no professor here.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.125
What the hell
happened to him?

35:29.045 --> 35:31.047
<i>He lost everything.</i>

35:31.214 --> 35:33.633
<i>Erik, Raven...</i>

35:33.800 --> 35:35.593
<i>his legs.</i>

35:35.760 --> 35:38.638
<i>We built the school,</i>
<i>the labs, this whole place...</i>

35:38.847 --> 35:42.559
then, just after
the first semester...

35:42.725 --> 35:44.310
the war in Vietnam
got worse.

35:45.395 --> 35:46.896
Many of the teachers...

35:47.313 --> 35:49.899
and older students
were drafted.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.609
It broke him.

35:52.068 --> 35:54.404
<i>He retreated into himself.</i>

35:54.571 --> 35:56.823
<i>I wanted to help,
do something...</i>

35:56.990 --> 35:59.033
<i>so I designed a serum
to treat his spine...</i>

35:59.200 --> 36:03.246
<i>derived from the same formula
that helps me
control my mutation.</i>

36:04.497 --> 36:07.208
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

36:08.877 --> 36:10.336
but he takes too much.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.755
I tried easing him back...

36:12.922 --> 36:16.426
but he just couldn't bear
the pain, the voices.

36:16.593 --> 36:19.053
The treatment
gives him his legs...

36:19.804 --> 36:21.723
but it's not enough.

36:21.931 --> 36:22.932
He's...

36:25.560 --> 36:27.228
He's just lost too much.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.076
<i>You're</i>
<i>not scared of me?</i>

36:42.952 --> 36:46.164
<i>I always</i>
<i>believed I couldn't be</i>
<i>the only one in the world.</i>

36:47.040 --> 36:48.208
<i>Charles Xavier.</i>

36:50.919 --> 36:52.086
Raven.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.173
You're hungry and alone.

36:55.548 --> 36:57.008
Take whatever you want.

36:57.091 --> 37:00.011
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.222
In fact...

37:02.388 --> 37:04.891
<i>you never have to
steal again.</i>

37:05.225 --> 37:07.227
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

37:12.774 --> 37:14.817
I'll
help you get her.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.697
Not for any of
your future shite,
but for her.

37:19.864 --> 37:21.032
Fair enough.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.327
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

37:24.535 --> 37:27.121
That man is a monster.
A murderer.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.999
You think you can
convince Raven to change?

37:30.083 --> 37:31.209
To come home?

37:31.626 --> 37:33.044
That's splendid.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.464
But what makes you think
you can change him?

37:36.631 --> 37:40.218
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

37:43.054 --> 37:44.555
<i>The room</i>
<i>they're holding him in</i>

37:44.639 --> 37:45.932
<i>was built during
the Second World War...</i>

37:46.099 --> 37:47.642
<i>when there was
a shortage of steel.</i>

37:47.725 --> 37:51.562
<i>So the foundation
is pure concrete
and sand. No metal.</i>

37:51.729 --> 37:52.814
He's being held...

37:52.981 --> 37:55.191
a hundred floors
beneath the most

37:55.316 --> 37:57.568
heavily guarded
building on the planet.

37:57.735 --> 37:59.112
Why is he in there?

38:00.822 --> 38:02.073
What, he forgot
to mention?

38:04.242 --> 38:05.285
Uh, JFK.

38:05.702 --> 38:06.744
He killed...

38:08.079 --> 38:11.749
What else explains
a bullet miraculously
curving through the air?

38:11.916 --> 38:13.543
Erik's always had
a way with guns.

38:13.668 --> 38:15.336
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

38:15.420 --> 38:16.796
This is your plan,
not mine.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.965
We don't have any
resources to get us in.

38:19.048 --> 38:20.717
Or out.

38:21.843 --> 38:23.136
It's just me and Hank.

38:23.219 --> 38:24.554
I knew a guy.

38:24.762 --> 38:26.180
Yeah, he'd be
a young man now.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.642
Grew up outside of D.C.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.311
He could get into anywhere.

38:31.477 --> 38:34.022
I just don't know how the hell
we're gonna find him.

38:35.356 --> 38:38.026
Is Cerebro
out of the question?

38:38.568 --> 38:39.902
If only you guys
had Internet.

38:43.281 --> 38:44.407
What's "Internet?"

38:47.910 --> 38:49.495
We have a phonebook.

38:55.918 --> 38:58.171
I thought you'd
be getting ready
for your trip, sir.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.256
I just came to
grab a couple files.

39:00.423 --> 39:03.801
Is that a new scarf?
It's nice.

39:03.968 --> 39:05.094
Thank you.

40:36.352 --> 40:37.437
Dr. Trask?

40:37.520 --> 40:38.521
One second.

40:39.730 --> 40:40.731
Oh.

40:41.107 --> 40:43.609
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

40:47.113 --> 40:48.364
Thank you.

40:49.532 --> 40:50.867
Is something wrong, sir?

40:51.868 --> 40:53.953
No. It's nothing.

40:54.287 --> 40:56.873
Would you mind
typing up my itinerary?

40:57.540 --> 40:59.041
I don't wanna
miss anything.

41:07.383 --> 41:08.843
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

41:08.926 --> 41:10.386
Just stop here.
All right, all right.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.638
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

41:30.239 --> 41:32.116
What's he done now?

41:32.200 --> 41:33.910
I will just
write you a check for
whatever he took.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.369
We just need to talk to him.

41:37.914 --> 41:42.251
Peter! The cops
are here. Again.

41:47.924 --> 41:50.426
I'm a princess.
What are you?

41:52.929 --> 41:54.805
I'm the Wolverine.

41:55.723 --> 41:56.724
Where's your brother?

42:00.144 --> 42:02.438
Go upstairs
and bug your sister.

42:02.522 --> 42:04.106
But she bugs me!

42:13.616 --> 42:14.700
What do
you guys want?

42:14.867 --> 42:17.536
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

42:18.663 --> 42:20.623
Just relax, Peter.
We're not cops.

42:20.790 --> 42:21.832
Of course you're not.
If you were,

42:21.916 --> 42:23.000
you wouldn't be
driving a rental car.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.168
How did you know
we've got a rental car?

42:24.293 --> 42:26.170
I checked your registration
when you were
walking to the door.

42:26.295 --> 42:27.255
I also had
some time to kill

42:27.338 --> 42:28.339
so I went through
your rental agreement.

42:28.506 --> 42:30.591
Saw you were
from out of town.
Are you FBI?

42:31.550 --> 42:33.678
No, you're not cops.
Hey, what's with this
gifted youngsters place?

42:33.844 --> 42:36.180
That's an old card.

42:37.431 --> 42:39.433
He's fascinating.
He's a pain in the arse.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.768
What, a teleporter?

42:40.935 --> 42:42.019
No, he's just fast.

42:42.144 --> 42:44.563
And when I knew him
he wasn't so... young.

42:45.398 --> 42:47.233
Young?
You're just old.

42:48.234 --> 42:50.111
So you're not afraid
to show your powers?

42:50.278 --> 42:51.612
What powers? What
are you talking about?

42:52.613 --> 42:54.073
Do you see
something strange here?

42:55.241 --> 42:57.368
Nothing anybody would
believe if you told them.

43:01.497 --> 43:03.040
So, who are you?
What do you want?

43:03.124 --> 43:04.792
We need
your help, Peter.
For what?

43:04.959 --> 43:07.003
To break into a highly
secured facility...

43:07.420 --> 43:08.713
and to get someone out.

43:08.879 --> 43:09.922
Prison break?

43:10.589 --> 43:11.757
That's illegal, you know.

43:12.049 --> 43:13.050
Um...

43:16.137 --> 43:17.972
Well, only if
you get caught.

43:18.139 --> 43:19.181
So, what's in it for me?

43:19.265 --> 43:22.643
You, you kleptomaniac,
get to break
into the Pentagon.

43:28.566 --> 43:30.234
How do I know
I can trust you?

43:31.235 --> 43:32.737
Because we're
just like you.

43:35.031 --> 43:36.240
Show him.

43:48.127 --> 43:50.087
That's cool,
but it's disgusting.

43:51.922 --> 43:56.719
Built in 1943,
the Pentagon is the world's
largest office building...

43:56.886 --> 43:59.764
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

43:59.930 --> 44:01.515
stretched over six
million square feet.

44:01.599 --> 44:02.600
Where's the bathroom?

44:03.100 --> 44:05.519
He always
needs to pee!

45:08.499 --> 45:10.751
Yeah, we're getting
broadcast signal down here.
What's going on?

45:10.835 --> 45:12.670
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

46:49.600 --> 46:53.395
...fought for and captured
the island of Iwo Jima
from the Japanese Empire.

46:54.063 --> 46:55.439
Now, this month-long battle...

46:55.606 --> 46:57.149
included some of
the fiercest fighting

46:57.274 --> 46:58.817
during World War
II in the Pacific...

47:14.625 --> 47:16.961
In three seconds,
those doors are
going to open...

47:17.127 --> 47:19.463
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us.

47:20.506 --> 47:22.299
I know. That's what
I'm waiting for.

47:22.383 --> 47:23.467
What are you doing?

47:23.551 --> 47:25.219
I'm holding your neck so
you don't get whiplash.

47:25.302 --> 47:26.303
What?

47:26.428 --> 47:28.639
Whiplash.

47:33.143 --> 47:34.478
Don't move!

47:49.493 --> 47:50.744
You're
good, it'll pass.

47:50.828 --> 47:51.996
It happens with everyone.

47:54.498 --> 47:56.667
You must have done
something pretty serious.

47:56.792 --> 47:58.210
What did you do, man?

47:58.294 --> 47:59.795
What did you do?

47:59.878 --> 48:01.589
What did you do?
Why'd they have you
in there?

48:01.672 --> 48:03.465
For killing the President.

48:04.258 --> 48:07.428
Ah. Wow.
Shit.

48:08.220 --> 48:09.888
The only thing
I'm guilty of

48:09.972 --> 48:11.557
is fighting for
people like us.

48:11.724 --> 48:13.601
You take karate?
You know karate, man?

48:13.684 --> 48:15.811
I don't know karate.

48:15.978 --> 48:17.229
But I know crazy.

48:18.397 --> 48:21.233
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, this
is a Code Red situation.

48:21.317 --> 48:23.319
We are evacuating
the entire floor...

48:23.402 --> 48:26.113
so that my associate and I...

48:26.196 --> 48:27.823
can, uh, secure the prison.

48:27.906 --> 48:29.408
Who are you?

48:29.533 --> 48:31.076
We're special operations,
CB...

48:31.201 --> 48:32.494
FB-CID.

48:32.578 --> 48:35.414
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

48:35.497 --> 48:37.333
but it is imperative
that you understand...

48:37.416 --> 48:38.959
we're in a complete
lockdown situation.

48:39.043 --> 48:40.711
We have to get you
to the third floor...

48:47.760 --> 48:49.803
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you finished?

48:55.017 --> 48:56.894
They told me
you control metal.

48:57.269 --> 48:58.479
"They"?

49:01.440 --> 49:04.652
You know,
my mom once knew a guy
who could do that.

49:07.237 --> 49:10.157
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

49:13.035 --> 49:14.536
Charles?

49:21.251 --> 49:23.170
Good to see you too,
old friend.

49:23.337 --> 49:24.463
And walking.

49:24.588 --> 49:26.048
No thanks to you.

49:27.508 --> 49:29.968
You're the last
person in the world
I expected to see today.

49:30.135 --> 49:31.428
Believe me...

49:31.595 --> 49:33.263
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to.

49:33.597 --> 49:35.599
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

49:35.766 --> 49:36.767
No killing.

49:37.184 --> 49:38.185
No helmet.

49:38.811 --> 49:40.771
I couldn't disobey
you even if I wanted.

49:40.938 --> 49:43.482
I'm never getting
inside of that head again.

49:44.817 --> 49:46.777
I need your word, Erik.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.115
Nobody move!

49:51.615 --> 49:53.617
Hold it right there!

49:55.661 --> 49:57.329
- Charles.
- Don't move.

49:57.496 --> 49:59.498
Hands up,
or we will shoot!

49:59.665 --> 50:01.291
Freeze them, Charles.
I can't.

50:01.375 --> 50:02.668
Hands up!

50:07.339 --> 50:08.424
No!

50:21.311 --> 50:25.524
<i>If I could save time
in a bottle</i>

50:26.817 --> 50:31.697
<i>The first thing
that I'd like to do</i>

50:31.780 --> 50:34.408
<i>Is to save every day</i>

50:34.491 --> 50:38.287
<i>Till eternity passes away</i>

50:38.370 --> 50:41.331
<i>Just to spend them with you</i>

50:42.583 --> 50:46.837
<i>If I could make days
last forever</i>

50:47.921 --> 50:51.508
<i>If words could make
wishes come true</i>

50:53.093 --> 50:55.679
<i>I'd save every day</i>

50:55.763 --> 50:58.599
<i>Like a treasure and then</i>

50:58.682 --> 51:03.061
<i>Again,
I would spend them with you</i>

51:03.771 --> 51:06.899
<i>But there never seems
to be enough time</i>

51:06.982 --> 51:09.401
<i>To do the things
you want to do</i>

51:09.485 --> 51:12.154
<i>Once you find them</i>

51:15.032 --> 51:17.367
<i>I've looked around
enough to know</i>

51:17.451 --> 51:22.164
<i>That you're the one I want
to go through time with</i>

52:01.745 --> 52:03.247
Thanks, kid.

52:07.918 --> 52:09.962
Peter,
thank you very, very much.

52:10.128 --> 52:11.129
You take care.

52:11.296 --> 52:12.548
Hey, I saw your
flight plan in the cockpit.

52:12.631 --> 52:13.632
Why are you going to Paris?

52:25.269 --> 52:27.020
Imagine if they were metal.

52:28.438 --> 52:30.190
Do me a favor
and return it for me.
Okay.

52:30.274 --> 52:31.608
And, Peter?

52:32.109 --> 52:33.360
Take it slow.

52:34.486 --> 52:36.363
Where did they
dig you up?

52:37.656 --> 52:39.950
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

52:41.201 --> 52:42.953
but, uh, you sent me.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.289
You and Charles.

52:45.455 --> 52:47.040
From the future.

53:09.479 --> 53:11.648
How did you lose them?

53:11.815 --> 53:14.067
The treatment for my
spine affects my DNA.

53:16.904 --> 53:19.406
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

53:20.240 --> 53:23.410
I sacrificed my powers
so that I could sleep.

53:25.871 --> 53:26.997
What do you know about it?

53:27.164 --> 53:28.415
I've lost my fair share.

53:28.498 --> 53:29.499
Ha.

53:29.917 --> 53:31.668
Dry your eyes, Erik.

53:31.835 --> 53:33.503
It doesn't justify
what you've done.

53:33.670 --> 53:35.339
You have no idea
what I've done.

53:35.505 --> 53:37.174
I know that you
took the things
that mean the most to me.

53:37.507 --> 53:39.760
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

53:39.843 --> 53:41.136
If you want a fight,
Erik...

53:41.219 --> 53:42.763
Sit down.
...I will give you a fight!

53:42.846 --> 53:43.972
Let him come.

53:44.056 --> 53:45.807
You abandoned me!

53:45.891 --> 53:47.100
You took her away...

53:47.184 --> 53:48.268
and you abandoned me!

53:48.435 --> 53:49.853
Angel.

53:50.187 --> 53:51.521
Azazel.

53:52.189 --> 53:54.024
Emma.

53:54.191 --> 53:55.567
Banshee.

53:56.526 --> 53:58.195
Mutant brothers
and sisters...

53:58.362 --> 53:59.821
all dead!

54:02.074 --> 54:03.784
Countless others...

54:03.867 --> 54:04.910
experimented on.

54:04.993 --> 54:06.036
Butchered!

54:06.119 --> 54:07.120
Erik!

54:07.204 --> 54:08.330
Where were you, Charles?

54:08.705 --> 54:10.999
We were supposed
to protect them!

54:11.541 --> 54:13.877
Where were you when your
own people needed you?

54:14.044 --> 54:16.129
Hiding! You and Hank!

54:16.546 --> 54:18.298
Pretending to be
something you're not!

54:18.882 --> 54:20.258
Erik!

54:22.094 --> 54:24.638
You abandoned us all.

54:44.783 --> 54:46.994
So, you were
always an asshole.

54:49.579 --> 54:52.124
I take it we're best
buddies in the future.

54:53.750 --> 54:55.127
I spent a lot of years

54:55.210 --> 54:56.920
trying to bring
you down, bub.

54:57.504 --> 54:59.256
How does that
work out for you?

54:59.423 --> 55:01.133
You're like me.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.052
You're a survivor.

55:08.140 --> 55:09.433
Do you wanna pick
all that shit up?

55:28.285 --> 55:32.831
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

55:33.790 --> 55:39.504
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win
a war, let alone against the American devils.

55:41.715 --> 55:43.341
I'm getting another bottle.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.443
Excuse me.

56:02.652 --> 56:04.613
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

56:04.988 --> 56:06.406
You speak Vietnamese.

56:06.656 --> 56:07.741
I'm an interpreter.

56:09.743 --> 56:12.245
I speak many tongues.

56:12.996 --> 56:15.165
Let me buy you another drink...

56:15.499 --> 56:17.584
unless you're here with someone.

56:18.293 --> 56:20.629
I'm alone.

56:21.880 --> 56:24.174
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

56:38.939 --> 56:41.608
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

56:46.696 --> 56:51.701
A pretty girl interested in politics...

56:51.785 --> 56:54.371
Looks can be deceiving.

56:54.788 --> 56:56.248
Lady.

56:57.040 --> 57:00.252
Show me more, baby?

57:02.045 --> 57:04.631
Clothes off?

57:17.102 --> 57:21.106
What's the matter, baby?
You don't think I
look pretty like this?

58:07.652 --> 58:10.447
Fancy a game?
It's been a while.

58:10.614 --> 58:12.282
I'm not in the mood
for games, thank you.

58:19.164 --> 58:22.083
I haven't had
a real sip in ten years.

58:34.888 --> 58:36.223
I didn't kill
the President.

58:37.015 --> 58:39.309
The bullet curved, Erik.

58:39.476 --> 58:40.977
Because I was
trying to save him.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.064
They took me out
before I could.

58:44.231 --> 58:45.273
Why would you
try and save him?

58:45.357 --> 58:47.984
Because he was one of us.

58:59.162 --> 59:01.581
You must think me
so foolish.

59:03.166 --> 59:05.168
We've always said they
would come after us.

59:05.335 --> 59:08.672
I never imagined they'd
use Raven's DNA to do it.

59:09.547 --> 59:10.840
When did you last see her?

59:14.511 --> 59:16.388
The day I left for Dallas.

59:17.389 --> 59:18.682
And how was she?

59:20.684 --> 59:21.685
Strong.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.561
Driven.

59:24.729 --> 59:25.772
Loyal.

59:25.855 --> 59:28.608
How... How was she?

59:30.360 --> 59:31.528
She was...

59:33.280 --> 59:35.031
We were...

59:38.535 --> 59:40.870
I could see why she
meant so much to you.

59:43.456 --> 59:45.125
You should be proud
of her, Charles.

59:46.710 --> 59:48.586
She's out there
fighting for our cause.

59:48.753 --> 59:50.130
Your cause.

59:50.922 --> 59:53.717
The girl I raised was
not capable of killing.

59:53.883 --> 59:55.385
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

59:55.552 --> 59:57.595
She couldn't stay
a little girl forever,
that's why she left.

59:57.762 --> 01:00:00.640
She left because you
got inside her head.

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:04.561
That's not my power.

01:00:06.563 --> 01:00:07.897
She made a choice.

01:00:08.064 --> 01:00:10.900
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:12.485
She's going to
murder Trask,

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:13.737
they're going
to capture her...

01:00:14.404 --> 01:00:16.656
and then they're
going to wipe us out.

01:00:16.823 --> 01:00:18.742
Not if we get
to her first.

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:22.162
Not if we change
history tomorrow.

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.336
I'm sorry, Charles...

01:00:33.757 --> 01:00:34.758
for what happened.

01:00:35.592 --> 01:00:36.926
I truly am.

01:00:41.014 --> 01:00:42.349
It's been a while
since I've played.

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:46.811
I'll go easy on you.

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:50.607
Might finally
be a fair fight.

01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:53.318
You have the first move.

01:01:07.457 --> 01:01:10.168
<i>The diplomats from
all around the world</i>

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:12.295
<i>are arriving here
today at the Hotel Royal.</i>

01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:13.880
<i>It's an historic day.</i>

01:01:14.047 --> 01:01:16.299
<i>It's the, uh,
official ending</i>

01:01:16.383 --> 01:01:19.135
<i>of the United States' military
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:21.471
<i>There we have
the South Vietnamese
Foreign Minister...</i>

01:01:21.638 --> 01:01:23.306
<i>with other South
Vietnamese dignitaries.</i>

01:01:24.224 --> 01:01:26.476
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

01:01:26.643 --> 01:01:28.186
The hotel has arranged
a private room

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.813
upstairs for
your special guests.

01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:31.940
That will be
plenty of time.

01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:40.031
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:42.826
Congratulations on
winning this war.

01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:45.453
Now, I know you all
have hands to shake

01:01:45.537 --> 01:01:47.664
and photos to
take downstairs...

01:01:47.831 --> 01:01:49.874
so I will get
right to the point.

01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:52.919
There is a new
enemy out there.

01:01:53.086 --> 01:01:55.588
An enemy that will
render your
arsenals useless...

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.048
your armies powerless...

01:01:57.215 --> 01:01:59.092
and your nations
defenseless.

01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:08.726
<i>You will need a new</i>
<i>weapon for this war.</i>
<i>I call them Sentinels.</i>

01:02:10.562 --> 01:02:12.480
Named after
the ancient guardians

01:02:12.564 --> 01:02:14.441
that stood at
the gates of the citadel.

01:02:16.693 --> 01:02:19.529
They have the
aeronautic capabilities
of a Harrier jet.

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.866
Armed with guns
that can fire off...

01:02:23.032 --> 01:02:27.036
<i>more than 2, 000
rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.</i>

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:29.706
But size, power,
speed...

01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:31.791
you could find that
at Lockheed or Boeing.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:34.461
No, what makes the
Sentinels so special...

01:02:34.627 --> 01:02:38.089
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

01:02:38.256 --> 01:02:39.757
A genetic
guidance system

01:02:39.883 --> 01:02:42.427
that can lock onto a mark
a half a mile away.

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:45.597
It won't trigger
unless it has
identified the target.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.599
With this weapon,
there will be

01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:49.309
no human
collateral damage.

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:52.312
If I turn it on,
the system couldn't
even activate in here.

01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:03.907
Unless there's a mutant.

01:03:12.457 --> 01:03:15.168
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:19.464
My machines
don't make mistakes.

01:03:21.925 --> 01:03:23.301
What are you?

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.012
I assure you...

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:29.098
No, don't shoot it.

01:03:29.766 --> 01:03:31.017
I assure you,

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.602
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:04:07.053 --> 01:04:08.096
Raven!

01:04:13.518 --> 01:04:15.395
Raven? Raven!

01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:20.817
Raven?

01:04:22.986 --> 01:04:24.153
Charles?

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.573
We've come for you,
Erik and I.

01:04:26.739 --> 01:04:27.740
Together.

01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:30.910
I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:33.329
I made you
a promise a long time ago

01:04:33.413 --> 01:04:34.539
that I would protect you.

01:04:42.297 --> 01:04:43.339
<i>Wolverine!</i>

01:04:47.552 --> 01:04:48.761
I'm going
to keep you safe.

01:04:48.928 --> 01:04:50.555
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:55.852
Erik?

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.188
Erik?
What are you doing?

01:05:00.857 --> 01:05:02.400
Securing our future.

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:04.527
Forgive me,
Mystique.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.363
As long as
you're out there,
we'll never be safe.

01:05:08.531 --> 01:05:09.657
Erik...

01:05:09.741 --> 01:05:11.743
Use your power,
Charles. Stop him.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:13.036
He can't.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.401
He's slipping back.

01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:46.778
I'm losing him.

01:06:28.444 --> 01:06:29.487
<i>Stryker!</i>

01:06:29.946 --> 01:06:32.073
<i>Someone will finish</i>
<i>what we've started, Wolverine!</i>

01:06:32.156 --> 01:06:33.199
<i>One day!</i>

01:06:38.663 --> 01:06:39.664
Restrain him.

01:06:54.804 --> 01:06:55.805
Erik!

01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:07.066
Where am I?

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.192
Huh?

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.320
How the hell
did I get here?

01:07:11.487 --> 01:07:13.072
What? You came to us.

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.324
Who are you?
Charles.

01:07:15.825 --> 01:07:16.993
Charles Xavier!

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.077
I don't know you.

01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:20.204
Huh?
What the hell is that?

01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:23.708
Whoa. Whoa.
Look, I can deal
with this. Just go.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.376
Stop Erik!

01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:26.961
Erik, please...

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.171
I'm sorry.

01:07:28.337 --> 01:07:29.505
Erik...

01:07:48.274 --> 01:07:50.568
You're Logan,
that's Hank McCoy,
I'm Charles Xavier.

01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:53.196
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:58.201
You're on acid.

01:07:59.035 --> 01:08:03.080
Somebody gave you
really bad acid, yeah?

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.835
Just hold on tight,

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.127
we'll get through
this together.

01:08:51.629 --> 01:08:52.921
Oh, my God, Kitty.

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:56.091
She's wounded
pretty bad.

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:02.491
I got him.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.247
Professor?

01:10:08.998 --> 01:10:10.082
What happened to you?

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.002
I just saw someone
who's gonna

01:10:13.085 --> 01:10:14.670
bring me a lot
of pain someday.

01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:18.507
Where's Raven?

01:10:19.175 --> 01:10:20.426
Gone.
What?

01:10:20.593 --> 01:10:22.637
We have to get
out of here.

01:10:23.012 --> 01:10:25.097
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

01:10:31.646 --> 01:10:33.314
<i>Yesterday,
the Paris Peace Summit...</i>

01:10:33.481 --> 01:10:36.192
<i>was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...</i>

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:38.653
<i>the likes of which
the world has never seen.</i>

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:41.489
<i>Mass hysteria
has gripped the nation
as people ask...</i>

01:10:41.656 --> 01:10:43.908
<i>"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"</i>

01:10:44.075 --> 01:10:46.994
<i>And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"</i>

01:10:47.161 --> 01:10:49.538
<i>That was London correspondent
Toby Elliot...</i>

01:10:49.622 --> 01:10:51.040
<i>reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:52.333
Fuck me.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:57.546
What the hell are
we dealing with here?
Off the record.

01:10:58.339 --> 01:11:01.717
Two days ago, this man,
Erik Lehnsherr...

01:11:01.884 --> 01:11:04.387
escaped from a
maximum security prison
inside the Pentagon.

01:11:04.553 --> 01:11:06.389
We believe
that this woman

01:11:06.472 --> 01:11:08.265
is a former associate
of Lehnsherr's.

01:11:08.599 --> 01:11:09.850
They were together
in Cuba,

01:11:09.934 --> 01:11:12.353
the day of
the crisis in '62.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.190
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.693
What about that thing?

01:11:18.859 --> 01:11:20.361
We don't know what
that thing is, sir.

01:11:20.528 --> 01:11:22.822
Actually, we really
don't know what
any of them are.

01:11:22.989 --> 01:11:25.533
Yes. Yes, we do.

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:27.785
They're mutants.

01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:33.124
He has the power
to control metal.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.542
Last I checked,
that's what

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.127
most of your weapons
were made of.

01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:40.172
And she can transform
into anyone.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:43.134
A general,
a secret serviceman.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.552
Even you,
Mr. President.

01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:46.470
She could walk
into this office...

01:11:46.637 --> 01:11:50.307
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

01:11:50.474 --> 01:11:52.059
And that's only
two of them.

01:11:52.226 --> 01:11:55.229
Do we have any
countermeasures?
Any defense?

01:11:55.396 --> 01:11:57.648
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

01:11:57.982 --> 01:12:01.736
That's an experimental
program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

01:12:10.536 --> 01:12:13.205
You're telling me
these mutants are
out in the world...

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.833
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.044
Many of the mutants
look like us.

01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:20.671
My Sentinels can
tell the difference.

01:12:20.921 --> 01:12:23.215
I have eight prototypes
ready to go.

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:25.301
They're built out of
a space-age polymer,

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:27.053
not an ounce
of metal on them.

01:12:33.684 --> 01:12:35.019
I want to make
a demonstration.

01:12:35.186 --> 01:12:37.438
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:39.648
What do you need
to get these
things operational?

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.358
I already gave that
number to Congress.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:44.278
Unfortunately,
they elected to
shut me down.

01:12:44.445 --> 01:12:47.031
It's going to cost
a bit more to
turn them on.

01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:50.201
Whatever you need.
Oh, and
one more thing.

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.788
If we do manage
to capture them,
I would like her.

01:12:53.954 --> 01:12:55.873
For research purposes,
of course.

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:59.794
I don't care who you screw,
as long as it's not me.

01:13:03.798 --> 01:13:05.174
Terrible thing.

01:13:06.342 --> 01:13:07.760
<i>What is?</i>

01:13:08.344 --> 01:13:09.637
Being born like that.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.846
Is it?

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.474
Can you imagine...

01:13:13.724 --> 01:13:16.393
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

01:13:17.478 --> 01:13:20.231
Yes, I can.

01:13:22.483 --> 01:13:25.110
Where do you think she comes from?

01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:28.155
You think she has a family?

01:13:29.824 --> 01:13:31.367
Yes.

01:13:31.534 --> 01:13:33.369
She does.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:23.127
If I see so much
as a screw move,

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.212
I will jam this
into your throat.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:27.548
How did you find me?

01:14:27.715 --> 01:14:29.216
You taught me well.

01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:31.719
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.597
I missed you.

01:14:34.763 --> 01:14:36.432
You tried to kill me.

01:14:36.599 --> 01:14:38.726
So the rest of us
could live.

01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:41.478
What do you mean?

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:44.064
We received a message
from the future.

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:46.150
Don't lie to me.

01:14:46.775 --> 01:14:48.777
I never have,
and I never will.

01:14:50.404 --> 01:14:52.823
Humans use your blood,
your genes,

01:14:52.907 --> 01:14:55.284
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out.

01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:56.869
I was only doing
what I thought

01:14:56.952 --> 01:14:58.913
necessary to secure
our future.

01:14:59.079 --> 01:15:00.372
So what's to stop me
from killing you

01:15:00.456 --> 01:15:02.249
right now and
securing my future?

01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:04.418
Nothing.

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:07.588
It doesn't matter
anymore.

01:15:07.755 --> 01:15:10.591
They have your DNA.
Your blood
was on the street.

01:15:11.258 --> 01:15:12.593
Whose fault was that?

01:15:14.261 --> 01:15:15.679
Mine.

01:15:16.597 --> 01:15:19.934
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.020
And now they have
what they need
to take it further.

01:15:25.314 --> 01:15:28.651
We have to strike now,
while we still hold
the upper hand.

01:15:31.487 --> 01:15:33.530
I've seen too many
friends die, Erik.

01:15:35.616 --> 01:15:37.868
I don't want a war.

01:15:37.952 --> 01:15:39.787
I only want the man
who murdered them.

01:15:39.954 --> 01:15:41.455
This is war.

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:45.125
What happened to you?

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.212
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

01:15:50.214 --> 01:15:52.299
Are you still Charles' Raven?

01:15:54.635 --> 01:15:57.054
Or are you Mystique?

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.017
Trask is the enemy.

01:16:04.186 --> 01:16:06.230
Killing one man isn't enough.

01:16:06.647 --> 01:16:07.982
It never was for you.

01:16:09.358 --> 01:16:10.567
Goodbye, Erik.

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:36.969
What happened?

01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:38.679
Come on.
Can he walk?

01:16:38.846 --> 01:16:40.014
He needs his treatment.

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:41.640
Hank, I can hear them.

01:16:41.724 --> 01:16:42.850
I know. It's okay.

01:16:43.017 --> 01:16:45.060
Can you make it stop?
I'll get them.

01:16:47.062 --> 01:16:48.188
Hey, hey.

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:50.024
Pull yourself together.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.692
It's not over yet.

01:16:54.862 --> 01:16:56.238
You don't believe that.

01:16:58.157 --> 01:16:59.533
How do you know?

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.368
As these go...

01:17:03.078 --> 01:17:06.373
this comes back.

01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.376
They all come back.

01:17:14.548 --> 01:17:15.966
Look.

01:17:16.717 --> 01:17:18.385
I'm still here...

01:17:19.428 --> 01:17:20.929
and she's still out there.

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:25.225
We need your help, Charles.

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:27.394
Not like this.
I need you.

01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:31.106
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

01:17:34.735 --> 01:17:37.071
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

01:17:42.743 --> 01:17:43.911
Charles.

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:17.402
Hank, do me a favor.

01:18:18.112 --> 01:18:20.405
Would you help me
to my study, please?

01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:27.162
Come on, I got you.

01:18:37.297 --> 01:18:39.591
Are you sure
about this?

01:18:40.968 --> 01:18:43.095
Absolutely not.

01:18:49.643 --> 01:18:51.812
This creature
is extraordinary.

01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:54.648
Her genes could hold the key

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.775
to mutation itself.

01:18:56.859 --> 01:18:57.943
I need more.

01:18:58.026 --> 01:19:00.863
That's all they were
able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:02.197
More than blood.

01:19:02.698 --> 01:19:04.491
I need brain tissue...

01:19:04.658 --> 01:19:07.286
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

01:19:08.412 --> 01:19:09.580
Imagine...

01:19:09.663 --> 01:19:11.206
Sentinels that
could transform,

01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:12.541
adapt to any target.

01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:15.460
If I could just get
my hands on her.

01:19:15.627 --> 01:19:17.462
This girl could leap

01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:19.298
the program forward years...

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.341
decades into the future.

01:19:22.676 --> 01:19:23.969
How old is your
son now, Major?

01:19:25.304 --> 01:19:26.388
Jason?

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:28.557
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.142
Eight years
from fighting age.

01:19:30.392 --> 01:19:32.227
And how many of
our sons and brothers

01:19:32.311 --> 01:19:34.062
did we just ship
home in body bags?

01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:36.190
Maybe fifty,
fifty-five thousand?

01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:37.816
And how many more
on the other side?

01:19:39.359 --> 01:19:41.195
Never before...

01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:44.364
in all of human history...

01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:49.203
has there been a cause
which could unite
us as a species.

01:19:50.204 --> 01:19:52.539
Until now.

01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:55.834
You really hate,
mutants, don't you?

01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:59.338
On the contrary,
I rather admire them.

01:19:59.504 --> 01:20:00.589
The things they can do.

01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:05.219
I see mutants
as our salvation.

01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:06.553
A common enemy.

01:20:07.387 --> 01:20:10.515
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:13.060
Extinction.

01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:14.519
I believe
our new friends...

01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:17.064
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

01:20:17.231 --> 01:20:19.566
A new era of genuine...

01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:22.486
and long-lasting peace.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:37.918
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:39.878
<i>Transport departure
in two hours.</i>

01:20:40.045 --> 01:20:44.049
<i>Repeat. Transport
departure in two hours.</i>

01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:53.016
When was the last time
you were down here?

01:20:53.225 --> 01:20:54.601
The last time we went
looking for students.

01:20:54.893 --> 01:20:56.603
A lifetime ago.

01:21:02.484 --> 01:21:04.653
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

01:21:28.135 --> 01:21:30.345
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.106
These are muscles
I haven't stretched
in a long time.

01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:25.692
Charles!

01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:29.237
Charles!

01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:39.956
Charles? It's all right.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.336
I'll go check
the generator.

01:22:52.094 --> 01:22:53.678
It's not the
machinery, is it?

01:22:54.513 --> 01:22:55.931
I can't do this.
My mind...

01:22:56.056 --> 01:22:57.265
Yes, you can.

01:22:57.391 --> 01:22:59.184
It won't take it.
You're just a little rusty.

01:22:59.267 --> 01:23:01.728
You don't understand.
It's not a question
of being rusty.

01:23:01.895 --> 01:23:03.647
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:07.359
But my power
comes from here.
It comes from...

01:23:08.068 --> 01:23:09.736
And it's broken.

01:23:10.862 --> 01:23:12.781
I feel like one
of my students.

01:23:13.073 --> 01:23:14.366
Helpless.

01:23:15.742 --> 01:23:16.952
It was a mistake
coming down here.

01:23:17.119 --> 01:23:18.662
It was a mistake
freeing Erik.

01:23:18.745 --> 01:23:21.123
This whole thing
has been one
bloody mistake.

01:23:21.206 --> 01:23:23.708
I'm sorry, Logan,
but they sent back
the wrong man.

01:23:24.543 --> 01:23:25.961
You're right.

01:23:27.295 --> 01:23:28.797
I am.

01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:31.216
Actually, it was
supposed to be you.

01:23:32.259 --> 01:23:35.804
But I was the only one
who could physically
make the trip.

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:37.597
And, uh...

01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:39.516
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

01:23:39.975 --> 01:23:42.769
But I do know that
a long time ago...

01:23:43.395 --> 01:23:45.772
actually, a long
time from now...

01:23:46.106 --> 01:23:49.276
I was your most
helpless student.

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:52.112
And you unlocked
my mind.

01:23:52.279 --> 01:23:54.948
You showed me
what I was.

01:23:55.115 --> 01:23:56.950
You showed me
what I could be.

01:23:57.117 --> 01:23:59.119
I don't know how
to do that for you.

01:23:59.286 --> 01:24:01.246
You're right.
I don't.

01:24:03.123 --> 01:24:05.167
But I know
someone who might.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.210
Hmm.

01:24:07.294 --> 01:24:10.255
Look into my mind.

01:24:10.464 --> 01:24:12.716
You saw what
I did to Cerebro.

01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:14.050
You don't want me
inside your head.

01:24:14.134 --> 01:24:15.218
There's no damage
you can do...

01:24:15.302 --> 01:24:16.678
that hasn't already
been done. Trust me.

01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:17.971
Come on.

01:24:29.441 --> 01:24:30.484
Hey.

01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:33.445
Hey, Logan.

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:34.529
Hi, Jean.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.072
Kill me.

01:24:36.156 --> 01:24:37.157
I love you.

01:24:40.452 --> 01:24:44.915
You poor, poor man.

01:24:44.998 --> 01:24:46.166
Look past me.

01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:48.168
No, I don't want
your suffering.

01:24:48.335 --> 01:24:50.253
I don't want your future!

01:24:50.337 --> 01:24:52.464
Look past my future.

01:24:52.714 --> 01:24:54.841
Look for your future.

01:24:58.345 --> 01:24:59.679
That's it.

01:25:00.055 --> 01:25:01.306
That's it.

01:25:03.016 --> 01:25:04.351
That's it.

01:25:52.274 --> 01:25:54.234
Charles.

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:57.445
Charles.

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.077
So this is what
becomes of us.

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:07.205
Erik was right.

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:10.083
Humanity
does this to us.

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:12.877
Not if we show
them a better path.

01:26:13.795 --> 01:26:15.463
You still believe?

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:18.091
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

01:26:18.258 --> 01:26:21.094
it doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.473
Sometimes we all need
a little help.

01:26:26.433 --> 01:26:28.101
Oh, I'm not
the man I was.

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.314
I open my mind...

01:26:32.897 --> 01:26:35.108
and it almost
overwhelms me.

01:26:35.442 --> 01:26:38.945
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

01:26:40.113 --> 01:26:42.657
All those voices...

01:26:44.409 --> 01:26:49.080
so much pain.

01:26:49.456 --> 01:26:52.792
It's not their pain
you're afraid of.

01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:54.961
It's yours, Charles.

01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:58.757
And as frightening
as it may be...

01:26:58.923 --> 01:27:01.760
that pain will
make you stronger.

01:27:02.093 --> 01:27:05.138
If you allow
yourself to feel it...

01:27:05.305 --> 01:27:07.015
embrace it...

01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:10.060
it will make you more powerful

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.354
than you ever imagined.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.272
It's the greatest

01:27:14.356 --> 01:27:15.857
gift we have...

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:17.859
to bear their pain

01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:19.861
without breaking.

01:27:20.028 --> 01:27:21.821
And it's born...

01:27:21.988 --> 01:27:24.366
from the most human power.

01:27:25.367 --> 01:27:26.951
Hope.

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:38.380
Please, Charles...

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:42.509
we need you to hope again.

01:27:50.809 --> 01:27:53.269
Find what you were
looking for?

01:27:59.067 --> 01:28:00.360
The power's
back on.

01:28:00.527 --> 01:28:01.820
Yes.

01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:04.572
Yes, it is.

01:29:44.964 --> 01:29:46.424
She's lost
too much blood.

01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:48.384
She can't keep
going like this.

01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:50.678
We have no
choice, Bobby.

01:29:50.845 --> 01:29:52.222
We can wake him up.
No!

01:29:53.807 --> 01:29:55.099
They need more time.

01:29:55.642 --> 01:29:57.685
I had...

01:29:58.269 --> 01:30:00.271
a glimpse into the past.

01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:01.815
If we wake Logan now...

01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:05.401
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.362
They need more time.

01:30:09.614 --> 01:30:11.574
There is someone else.

01:30:11.658 --> 01:30:13.409
No, no one
has Kitty's power.

01:30:13.493 --> 01:30:15.662
Someone that could
take her power,

01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:17.205
take her place.

01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:19.874
She took yours once.

01:30:19.999 --> 01:30:20.959
Rogue.

01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:23.586
I'm sorry, Bobby,
she must be dead.

01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:24.838
I haven't been
able to make

01:30:24.921 --> 01:30:26.256
a connection
with her for years.

01:30:26.339 --> 01:30:27.549
That's because
they're keeping her

01:30:27.632 --> 01:30:29.676
in the one place
your mind can't reach

01:30:29.759 --> 01:30:31.261
from the outside.

01:30:31.344 --> 01:30:33.555
She's in Cerebro.

01:30:33.763 --> 01:30:35.431
She's in your house,
Professor.

01:30:36.057 --> 01:30:37.225
They're experimenting
on her.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.436
Trying to tap into her power,
so they can take ours.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.521
Take all of ours.

01:30:41.604 --> 01:30:43.398
If you knew this,
why didn't you
go after her?

01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:46.192
We tried.
It's too heavily
guarded.

01:30:46.317 --> 01:30:47.402
I may know a few things

01:30:47.485 --> 01:30:49.946
about that house
they don't.

01:30:56.119 --> 01:30:58.538
Kitty, I'm
going to get help.

01:30:58.705 --> 01:31:00.874
I'm gonna bring back
somebody to help you.

01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:06.588
Please, just bring
yourself back.

01:31:30.737 --> 01:31:32.196
Raven, stop.

01:31:33.156 --> 01:31:34.782
Stop running.

01:31:35.116 --> 01:31:36.284
Charles?

01:31:38.328 --> 01:31:39.412
Where are you?

01:31:39.495 --> 01:31:40.705
Back at the house...

01:31:40.788 --> 01:31:42.582
where you should be.

01:31:42.749 --> 01:31:44.917
I need you to come home.

01:31:45.627 --> 01:31:47.462
I know what
I need to do.

01:31:51.132 --> 01:31:52.342
If you kill Trask...

01:31:52.425 --> 01:31:54.594
you will be creating
countless more
just like him.

01:31:55.261 --> 01:31:56.346
Then I'll kill
them, too.

01:31:56.471 --> 01:31:58.973
Those are Erik's words,
not yours.

01:32:00.016 --> 01:32:01.517
Oh!

01:32:02.644 --> 01:32:05.146
The girl I grew up
with wasn't
capable of killing.

01:32:05.271 --> 01:32:06.272
She was good...

01:32:06.397 --> 01:32:08.983
fair, full of compassion.

01:32:10.318 --> 01:32:12.070
I have compassion.

01:32:12.153 --> 01:32:13.655
Just not for Trask.

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.448
He's murdered
too many of us.

01:32:20.161 --> 01:32:21.287
Shut her down, Charles.
Get in her head.

01:32:21.454 --> 01:32:22.914
She's
not letting me in.

01:32:23.081 --> 01:32:26.292
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:36.302
I know what
Trask has done...

01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:38.971
but killing him
will not bring them back.

01:32:39.639 --> 01:32:40.723
It will set you
on a path...

01:32:40.807 --> 01:32:42.809
from which
there is no return.

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:45.228
An endless cycle
of killing.

01:32:45.395 --> 01:32:49.148
Us and them,
until there is
nothing left.

01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:53.986
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:57.907
You just have
to come home.

01:32:59.283 --> 01:33:01.077
I have to?

01:33:01.452 --> 01:33:02.912
You haven't changed
at all, Charles.

01:33:04.247 --> 01:33:05.331
Like I said...

01:33:05.498 --> 01:33:07.834
I know exactly
what I have to do.

01:33:10.002 --> 01:33:11.504
You do?

01:33:13.506 --> 01:33:16.426
Then, wherever you go,
I will find you.

01:33:16.843 --> 01:33:20.680
And, Raven,
if you make me,
I will stop you.

01:33:22.181 --> 01:33:23.516
Good luck, Charles.

01:33:36.988 --> 01:33:37.989
Where is she?

01:33:38.156 --> 01:33:40.241
She's in an airport,
boarding a plane.

01:33:40.324 --> 01:33:41.659
She could be
going anywhere.

01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:47.123
Get some
rest, Charles.

01:33:47.206 --> 01:33:48.458
We'll track her
in the morning
and find out

01:33:48.541 --> 01:33:50.752
exactly where
she's going.

01:33:54.005 --> 01:33:56.174
<i>...rockets did land</i>
<i>outside the base,</i>

01:33:56.257 --> 01:33:59.010
<i>killing five civilians
and wounding 12 others.</i>

01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:01.971
Yeah?

01:34:05.767 --> 01:34:08.144
You know that those things
can give you cancer?

01:34:08.227 --> 01:34:11.481
I've done some
toxicology tests
in the lab, and...

01:34:16.569 --> 01:34:17.904
You want something?

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:20.698
Yeah, I'm...

01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:23.534
I know it's complicated,

01:34:23.618 --> 01:34:25.161
and there's probably
all kinds of rules

01:34:25.244 --> 01:34:27.163
and reasons for what
you can and can't say,

01:34:28.539 --> 01:34:30.458
but I was wondering
if you could tell me

01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:34.754
in the future,
do I make it?

01:34:35.421 --> 01:34:36.506
No.

01:34:37.965 --> 01:34:38.966
Oh.

01:34:39.801 --> 01:34:40.802
Okay.

01:34:42.804 --> 01:34:44.430
It's okay. Thanks.

01:34:44.514 --> 01:34:45.515
Hey, kid?

01:34:48.559 --> 01:34:50.478
It's just the world
I came from.

01:35:00.446 --> 01:35:02.281
We're going
backwards in time.

01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:14.794
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

01:35:14.877 --> 01:35:16.546
the President will
make his announcement.

01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:18.756
He will be joined by
Secretary of Defense Laird...

01:35:18.881 --> 01:35:20.258
and has even
sought the help

01:35:20.341 --> 01:35:22.510
of renowned scientist
Bolivar Trask...

01:35:22.677 --> 01:35:25.221
his special advisor
to combat this
mutant issue.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.890
The White House has
asked all three networks

01:35:27.974 --> 01:35:29.350
to air the event live,

01:35:29.433 --> 01:35:31.727
as it is a
matter of importance

01:35:31.811 --> 01:35:33.187
not only to the
United States,

01:35:33.271 --> 01:35:35.731
but to every citizen
from around the globe.

01:35:35.815 --> 01:35:37.608
There are no other details
about the event...

01:35:46.659 --> 01:35:47.952
Raven...

01:35:48.703 --> 01:35:50.580
My God.

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:53.207
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:56.335
I, uh...

01:35:57.211 --> 01:35:58.921
I guess,
I just realized

01:35:59.005 --> 01:36:01.090
I have nowhere
else to go.

01:36:03.175 --> 01:36:04.969
I've gotta wake Charles...
No, don't.

01:36:05.678 --> 01:36:07.013
Just wait.

01:36:21.611 --> 01:36:24.655
You really shouldn't
walk on this.

01:36:24.739 --> 01:36:27.283
I've had worse.

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:30.411
So, you've been living
here all these years?

01:36:30.494 --> 01:36:32.163
Someone had to
take care of Charles.

01:36:33.706 --> 01:36:36.626
You know,
he's missed you.

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:39.879
He misses who I was.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.217
I'm not who he wants
me to be anymore.

01:36:47.762 --> 01:36:49.472
I've missed you.

01:36:51.349 --> 01:36:53.768
So, you're like this
all the time now.

01:36:53.851 --> 01:36:54.852
Like what?

01:36:55.353 --> 01:36:56.354
This.

01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:00.441
No, not
all the time.

01:37:00.524 --> 01:37:02.610
I take a shot
in the morning,

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:04.278
and I need another
if I get worked up.

01:37:05.196 --> 01:37:07.031
Worked up?

01:37:07.114 --> 01:37:08.783
Yeah, yeah,
when I'm...

01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:12.453
...emotional
or excited.

01:37:14.455 --> 01:37:17.708
Any animal urges.

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.251
Hmm.

01:37:20.586 --> 01:37:22.338
Usually, I can
fight them off.

01:37:22.505 --> 01:37:24.173
Well, maybe,
we shouldn't
have to fight off

01:37:24.256 --> 01:37:26.050
the things that
come naturally to us.

01:37:59.792 --> 01:38:02.920
Do you remember
one of the last things
you said to me?

01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:07.842
That I would never
be deemed beautiful,
looking like this?

01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:13.305
Do you still think that?

01:38:13.472 --> 01:38:16.308
Maybe. You saw
what happened in Paris.

01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:19.729
You know what
they think of us.

01:38:21.022 --> 01:38:22.398
What do you think?

01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:32.408
I think you're beautiful.

01:38:33.075 --> 01:38:34.827
What about yourself?

01:38:42.585 --> 01:38:45.212
You should get some rest.

01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:49.633
I'm glad you're home.

01:38:55.723 --> 01:38:57.183
Hank?

01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:01.479
Do you remember
the last thing
I said to you?

01:39:05.483 --> 01:39:08.611
It was, "Mutant and proud."

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:40.059
<i>The old gas</i>
<i>and water pipes lead</i>
<i>straight to the house.</i>

01:39:45.981 --> 01:39:48.442
<i>The walls are made
of reinforced steel.</i>

01:39:48.526 --> 01:39:50.444
In other words, a door.

01:40:02.039 --> 01:40:05.417
<i>You're walking</i>
<i>directly over the hall now.</i>

01:40:58.095 --> 01:41:00.181
I've been
on that slab.

01:41:00.264 --> 01:41:02.183
Let me show you
how it feels.

01:41:08.772 --> 01:41:10.941
Rogue, Rogue,
come on. Wake up.

01:41:14.486 --> 01:41:15.738
Rogue.

01:41:16.822 --> 01:41:19.283
Come on, Rogue, wake up.
Wake up, it's me.

01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:28.792
No.

01:41:51.857 --> 01:41:54.860
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue,
it's okay. He's with me.

01:41:54.985 --> 01:41:56.111
We're gonna
get you out of here.

01:42:17.007 --> 01:42:18.175
<i>Erik, Bobby.</i>

01:42:18.384 --> 01:42:19.885
<i>Get out of there! Now!</i>

01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.154
Take her!

01:42:39.738 --> 01:42:41.490
Bobby! No!

01:42:44.368 --> 01:42:45.369
Bobby!

01:42:59.591 --> 01:43:00.759
Bobby!

01:43:35.252 --> 01:43:36.337
Professor!

01:43:38.172 --> 01:43:39.965
Get us out of here.

01:43:40.049 --> 01:43:41.884
Bobby.
I know.

01:45:20.232 --> 01:45:21.984
I'm sorry, Charles.

01:45:50.596 --> 01:45:52.264
Where's Bobby?

01:45:54.224 --> 01:45:55.934
I'm sorry, Kitty.

01:46:32.971 --> 01:46:34.097
Hello, Logan.

01:46:43.899 --> 01:46:44.900
Rogue.

01:46:47.986 --> 01:46:49.321
Raven was here.

01:46:49.488 --> 01:46:51.031
I screwed up.
Shit.

01:47:03.043 --> 01:47:04.503
We can't track her now.

01:47:06.797 --> 01:47:08.423
She's cut her ties.

01:47:11.301 --> 01:47:13.136
Hey, I saw in the
news last night

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:15.597
there's going to be
an announcement in
Washington this afternoon

01:47:15.681 --> 01:47:17.933
about a new
protocol for mutants.

01:47:20.102 --> 01:47:22.104
I set the system
I designed...

01:47:22.187 --> 01:47:24.565
to record any news
about Paris over
all three networks...

01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.024
and PBS.

01:47:26.441 --> 01:47:28.026
All three? Wow.

01:47:28.318 --> 01:47:30.028
Yeah, and PBS.

01:47:31.029 --> 01:47:32.406
Look what I found.

01:47:32.573 --> 01:47:34.157
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

01:47:34.241 --> 01:47:35.450
the President will
make his announcement.

01:47:35.993 --> 01:47:38.161
He will be joined
by Secretary of
Defense Laird...

01:47:38.328 --> 01:47:39.830
and has even
sought the help

01:47:39.913 --> 01:47:41.915
of renowned scientist
Bolivar Trask...

01:47:42.082 --> 01:47:45.586
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

01:47:45.752 --> 01:47:46.837
The White House has asked...

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.088
Raven
doesn't realize...

01:47:48.171 --> 01:47:50.048
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

01:47:50.132 --> 01:47:52.551
with the whole
world watching...

01:47:53.302 --> 01:47:55.762
Then I came a
long way for nothing.

01:47:56.305 --> 01:47:58.265
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

01:47:58.849 --> 01:48:00.350
they found traces
of her blood in Paris.

01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:03.687
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

01:48:03.854 --> 01:48:04.980
which is all they'd need.

01:48:05.063 --> 01:48:07.232
To create the
Sentinels of the future.

01:48:10.777 --> 01:48:12.821
There's a theory
in quantum physics...

01:48:12.904 --> 01:48:14.489
that time is immutable.

01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:16.575
It's like a river.
You can throw
a pebble into it...

01:48:16.658 --> 01:48:19.953
and create a ripple,
but the current always
corrects itself.

01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:24.625
No matter what you do,
the river just keeps flowing
in the same direction.

01:48:25.042 --> 01:48:26.335
What are you
trying to say?

01:48:26.501 --> 01:48:28.420
What I'm saying is...

01:48:28.587 --> 01:48:30.130
what if the war
is inevitable?

01:48:30.255 --> 01:48:32.633
What if she's
meant to kill Trask?

01:48:34.176 --> 01:48:36.720
What if this is just
simply who she is?

01:48:38.764 --> 01:48:40.599
Just because
someone stumbles,

01:48:40.682 --> 01:48:42.726
loses their way...

01:48:42.893 --> 01:48:44.895
doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

01:48:49.733 --> 01:48:52.444
No, I don't believe
that theory, Hank.

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.323
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

01:48:57.616 --> 01:48:58.700
Ready the plane.

01:48:58.784 --> 01:49:01.119
We're going to Washington.

01:49:18.303 --> 01:49:19.805
You all right?

01:49:20.055 --> 01:49:20.847
Getting there.

01:49:25.769 --> 01:49:28.438
Whatever happens today,
I need you to
promise me something.

01:49:29.314 --> 01:49:32.442
You've looked
into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:34.986
but you've seen
the good, too.

01:49:36.029 --> 01:49:37.698
The X-Men.

01:49:38.949 --> 01:49:40.534
Promise me
you'll find us.

01:49:42.327 --> 01:49:44.329
Use your power,
bring us together.

01:49:44.955 --> 01:49:47.040
Guide us. Lead us.

01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:51.503
Storm. Scott.

01:49:53.672 --> 01:49:55.006
Jean.

01:49:56.341 --> 01:49:58.510
Remember those names.

01:49:59.511 --> 01:50:01.847
There are so many of us.

01:50:02.514 --> 01:50:04.850
We will need you,
Professor.

01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:10.230
I'll do my best.

01:50:10.397 --> 01:50:12.065
Your best is enough.

01:50:13.984 --> 01:50:15.694
Trust me.

01:50:39.676 --> 01:50:42.137
There's 12 carriers
inbound, 10 miles!

01:50:43.138 --> 01:50:44.222
They've found us.

01:51:01.281 --> 01:51:03.450
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

01:51:03.533 --> 01:51:04.910
They've come from
all over the world...

01:51:05.035 --> 01:51:07.829
to witness history,
along with news crews...

01:51:07.996 --> 01:51:09.539
from at least
50 different countries.

01:51:11.249 --> 01:51:12.584
Thank you.

01:51:14.961 --> 01:51:16.129
Can I see your
invitations, please?

01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:18.381
Yes, you may.

01:51:18.465 --> 01:51:19.633
These two
are with me.

01:51:19.716 --> 01:51:20.717
Go ahead.

01:51:20.801 --> 01:51:21.927
Thank you.

01:51:28.725 --> 01:51:30.101
Logan!

01:51:30.185 --> 01:51:31.436
Please, this way, sir.

01:51:50.705 --> 01:51:54.584
Fourth infantry...
Took a Bouncing Betty.

01:51:55.836 --> 01:51:57.254
What happened to you?

01:51:58.338 --> 01:51:59.548
Friendly fire.

01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:01.591
The worst kind.

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.093
Yeah.

01:52:17.148 --> 01:52:18.984
I haven't found her yet,
but she has to be here.

01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:20.694
<i>The President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

01:52:43.592 --> 01:52:45.302
My fellow Americans...

01:52:45.468 --> 01:52:50.140
today we face
the gravest threat
in our history...

01:52:50.265 --> 01:52:51.433
mutants.

01:52:54.603 --> 01:52:57.022
We have prepared
for this threat.

01:53:00.025 --> 01:53:03.612
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

01:53:03.778 --> 01:53:04.904
"Behold.

01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:08.283
"The world will never be
the same again."

01:53:38.813 --> 01:53:39.814
Can I help you?

01:53:43.193 --> 01:53:44.402
No, you can't.

01:54:27.779 --> 01:54:28.988
Here they come.

01:54:35.704 --> 01:54:37.372
<i>This is for you,</i>
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

01:54:39.958 --> 01:54:41.042
Raven?

01:54:43.795 --> 01:54:44.879
I have her.

01:54:45.547 --> 01:54:46.756
Let me go, Charles.

01:54:48.925 --> 01:54:50.385
There. You see?

01:54:50.552 --> 01:54:51.636
Secret Serviceman.

01:54:51.803 --> 01:54:52.887
Left of the stage.

01:54:53.012 --> 01:54:54.139
- Got him.
- Go.

01:55:14.909 --> 01:55:16.202
What the hell
are you doing?

01:55:16.286 --> 01:55:17.704
I didn't tell you
to activate them.

01:55:17.787 --> 01:55:18.955
I didn't.

01:55:37.557 --> 01:55:39.434
<i>Raven, please,</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

01:55:39.934 --> 01:55:44.063
<i>We've been given
a second chance
to define who we are.</i>

01:55:46.107 --> 01:55:47.484
<i>Don't do this.</i>

01:55:50.904 --> 01:55:53.156
Gentlemen, you cannot
pass this point.

01:56:00.997 --> 01:56:02.749
We can't stop that many.

01:56:02.916 --> 01:56:05.794
No, but we can
slow them down.

01:56:43.665 --> 01:56:45.333
Erik!

01:57:19.617 --> 01:57:20.618
Ah!

01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:31.880
Storm!

01:57:50.273 --> 01:57:51.691
Go, go, go!

01:57:53.651 --> 01:57:54.736
Watch your head!

01:58:07.707 --> 01:58:08.791
Go, go, go!

01:58:08.875 --> 01:58:10.251
Take us to DEFCON 3.

01:58:10.418 --> 01:58:11.586
Mr. President,
we are Code Red.

01:58:11.711 --> 01:58:13.087
What's our air
defense readiness?

01:58:13.254 --> 01:58:14.505
All our air
defenses are ready one.

01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:16.007
What the hell
happened out there?

01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:17.175
I will fix it.

01:58:17.258 --> 01:58:18.301
You said that before.

01:58:18.426 --> 01:58:19.636
I wanted to
make a statement.

01:58:19.761 --> 01:58:22.555
Now the whole
goddamn world knows
we can't protect them.

01:58:22.639 --> 01:58:23.723
I will fix it.

01:58:23.806 --> 01:58:25.600
You damn well better.

01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:38.047
Charles!

01:59:39.173 --> 01:59:40.508
No, no, no...

02:00:27.096 --> 02:00:28.848
Is everybody okay?

02:01:02.715 --> 02:01:04.300
No!

02:01:07.428 --> 02:01:08.471
Behind you.

02:01:10.848 --> 02:01:12.725
Ah!

02:01:51.264 --> 02:01:52.265
Now!

02:02:30.303 --> 02:02:31.929
Do what you
were made for.

02:02:41.105 --> 02:02:42.607
Where are you?

02:02:48.404 --> 02:02:49.405
Ah!

02:02:59.957 --> 02:03:01.459
I got this! Go!

02:03:44.251 --> 02:03:45.878
Oh, dear God, no.

02:04:01.811 --> 02:04:04.021
So much for
being a survivor.

02:04:46.439 --> 02:04:47.732
One of them is in here.

02:04:50.359 --> 02:04:52.111
No, no, no!
Don't kill it!

02:04:52.778 --> 02:04:53.863
I need it alive.

02:05:07.293 --> 02:05:08.919
What the hell
has happened?

02:06:16.695 --> 02:06:18.906
You built these
weapons to destroy us.

02:06:19.865 --> 02:06:21.575
Why?

02:06:25.162 --> 02:06:27.873
<i>Because you are
afraid of our gifts.</i>

02:06:28.833 --> 02:06:31.335
<i>Because we are different.</i>

02:06:32.503 --> 02:06:35.840
<i>Humanity has always feared
that which is different.</i>

02:06:36.507 --> 02:06:37.883
<i>Well, I am here
to tell you...</i>

02:06:38.092 --> 02:06:39.510
to tell the world...

02:06:40.511 --> 02:06:42.680
you are right
to fear us.

02:06:43.055 --> 02:06:44.765
<i>We are the future.</i>

02:06:45.516 --> 02:06:48.185
<i>We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.</i>

02:06:48.435 --> 02:06:51.021
And anyone who
stands in our way...

02:06:51.188 --> 02:06:53.190
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

02:06:53.357 --> 02:06:54.692
you see before you.

02:07:01.907 --> 02:07:04.535
<i>Today was meant
to be a display
of your power.</i>

02:07:05.286 --> 02:07:07.371
Instead I give
you a glimpse...

02:07:07.538 --> 02:07:11.041
<i>of the devastation
my race can unleash
upon yours.</i>

02:07:20.259 --> 02:07:22.428
<i>Let this be a warning
to the world.</i>

02:07:23.137 --> 02:07:25.931
<i>And to my mutant
brothers and sisters
out there...</i>

02:07:26.724 --> 02:07:28.142
<i>I say this.</i>

02:07:28.893 --> 02:07:30.561
<i>No more hiding.</i>

02:07:30.728 --> 02:07:32.563
<i>No more suffering.</i>

02:07:33.397 --> 02:07:35.774
You have lived
in the shadows...

02:07:35.941 --> 02:07:38.777
<i>in shame and
fear for too long.
Come out.</i>

02:07:40.029 --> 02:07:41.363
<i>Join me.</i>

02:07:41.447 --> 02:07:44.950
<i>Fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

02:07:45.576 --> 02:07:47.244
A new tomorrow...

02:07:48.454 --> 02:07:50.247
that starts today.

02:07:57.546 --> 02:07:59.381
<i>All those years wasted...</i>

02:07:59.548 --> 02:08:01.550
fighting each other,
Charles.

02:08:05.095 --> 02:08:08.724
To have a precious
few of them back...

02:08:23.238 --> 02:08:24.448
Mr. President, sir.
Stand down.

02:08:24.531 --> 02:08:26.408
I said, stand down!

02:08:28.243 --> 02:08:29.912
You want to
make a statement?

02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:32.122
Kill me. Fine.

02:08:32.289 --> 02:08:34.249
But spare everyone else.

02:08:46.804 --> 02:08:48.806
Very heroic,
Mr. President...

02:08:49.306 --> 02:08:50.808
but you had no intention...

02:08:50.933 --> 02:08:53.143
of sparing any of us.

02:08:53.602 --> 02:08:56.939
The future of our
species begins now.

02:09:32.474 --> 02:09:33.642
You used to be
a better shot.

02:09:33.726 --> 02:09:34.977
Trust me,
I still am.

02:09:48.824 --> 02:09:50.325
Get out of my head,
Charles!

02:09:50.492 --> 02:09:51.994
Raven.

02:09:52.161 --> 02:09:54.038
Please, do not make us
the enemy today.

02:09:54.246 --> 02:09:56.081
Look around you.
We already are.

02:09:56.582 --> 02:09:58.333
Not all of us.

02:09:58.542 --> 02:10:00.794
All you've done so far...

02:10:01.128 --> 02:10:03.130
is save the lives
of these men.

02:10:04.173 --> 02:10:06.717
You can show them
a better path.

02:10:10.387 --> 02:10:11.847
Shut her down, Charles.

02:10:14.892 --> 02:10:17.561
I've been trying to
control you ever since
the day we met...

02:10:18.145 --> 02:10:20.147
and look where
that's got us.

02:10:22.274 --> 02:10:25.110
Everything that
happens now...

02:10:25.736 --> 02:10:27.946
is in your hands.

02:10:31.992 --> 02:10:34.745
I have faith
in you, Raven.

02:12:11.758 --> 02:12:13.886
He's all
yours, Charles.

02:12:41.455 --> 02:12:44.082
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

02:12:44.249 --> 02:12:45.626
You know that.

02:12:46.293 --> 02:12:47.878
I know.

02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:51.548
Goodbye, old friend.

02:12:54.217 --> 02:12:56.053
Goodbye, Erik.

02:13:29.461 --> 02:13:31.463
Are you sure you
should let them go?

02:13:32.422 --> 02:13:33.799
Yes.

02:13:34.424 --> 02:13:36.134
I have hope for them.

02:13:37.302 --> 02:13:41.306
There's going to
be a time, Hank, when
we are all together.

02:13:45.185 --> 02:13:47.145
What about Logan?

02:14:18.969 --> 02:14:21.638
<i>The first time</i>

02:14:24.641 --> 02:14:29.896
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.196
<i>I thought the sun...</i>

02:15:02.763 --> 02:15:06.016
Buckminster Fuller
is a great example
of an architect...

02:15:06.099 --> 02:15:10.353
whose ideas were
very similar to those
of a utopian future.

02:15:16.693 --> 02:15:19.362
Good morning, Logan.
Late start.

02:15:29.456 --> 02:15:30.791
Have a good lunch.

02:15:30.957 --> 02:15:32.209
- Good job.
- Thank you.

02:15:32.542 --> 02:15:33.877
Very good job.

02:15:34.753 --> 02:15:36.338
Storm.

02:16:07.410 --> 02:16:08.495
Jean.

02:16:09.913 --> 02:16:11.248
Hey, Logan.

02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:12.916
Jean.

02:16:13.625 --> 02:16:15.335
Are you okay?

02:16:17.087 --> 02:16:18.505
You're here.

02:16:19.131 --> 02:16:21.174
Where else would I be?

02:16:23.468 --> 02:16:24.469
Whoa.

02:16:25.303 --> 02:16:27.264
Easy, pal.

02:16:28.807 --> 02:16:31.351
Well, some things
never change.

02:16:32.769 --> 02:16:34.353
It's good to
see you, Scott.

02:16:36.147 --> 02:16:37.398
Uh-huh.

02:16:37.482 --> 02:16:38.650
See you
later, Jean.

02:16:42.779 --> 02:16:44.322
Professor.

02:16:44.781 --> 02:16:47.575
Logan, is everything
all right?

02:16:50.954 --> 02:16:52.414
Yeah.

02:16:53.456 --> 02:16:55.291
Yeah, I think it is.

02:17:11.850 --> 02:17:13.058
You did it.

02:17:13.143 --> 02:17:14.394
Did what?

02:17:14.477 --> 02:17:16.478
Logan, don't you have
a class to teach?

02:17:17.147 --> 02:17:18.815
A class to teach?

02:17:19.858 --> 02:17:20.941
History.

02:17:21.651 --> 02:17:23.153
History?

02:17:23.986 --> 02:17:25.655
Actually, I could use
some help with that.

02:17:26.156 --> 02:17:27.656
Help with what?

02:17:27.824 --> 02:17:31.327
Pretty much
everything after 1973.

02:17:35.874 --> 02:17:38.919
I think the history
I know is a little
different.

02:17:40.545 --> 02:17:42.254
Welcome back.

02:17:45.008 --> 02:17:46.675
It's good to
see you, Charles.

02:17:48.053 --> 02:17:49.888
It's good to see everyone.

02:17:50.055 --> 02:17:51.556
Well...

02:17:52.182 --> 02:17:54.351
I had a promise to keep.

02:17:55.518 --> 02:17:58.772
You and I have a lot of
catching up to do.

02:17:59.689 --> 02:18:01.191
Yeah.

02:18:04.736 --> 02:18:06.862
What's the last thing
you remember?

02:18:11.951 --> 02:18:13.702
Drowning.

02:18:21.962 --> 02:18:23.213
<i>The past.</i>

02:18:24.714 --> 02:18:25.966
<i>A new...</i>

02:18:26.049 --> 02:18:27.800
<i>and uncertain world.</i>

02:18:39.228 --> 02:18:41.522
<i>A world of</i>
<i>endless possibilities.</i>

02:18:44.276 --> 02:18:46.403
<i>And infinite outcomes.</i>

02:18:48.071 --> 02:18:49.197
You kidding me?

02:18:49.322 --> 02:18:50.781
Oh, he's alive!

02:18:55.161 --> 02:18:57.914
<i>Countless</i>
<i>choices define our fate.</i>

02:18:58.832 --> 02:19:01.293
<i>Each choice,
each moment...</i>

02:19:01.459 --> 02:19:04.087
<i>a ripple in the river of time.</i>

02:19:04.254 --> 02:19:06.589
What do you want
us to do with him,
Major Stryker?

02:19:06.755 --> 02:19:08.508
<i>Enough ripples...</i>

02:19:08.674 --> 02:19:11.261
<i>and you change the tide.</i>

02:19:11.428 --> 02:19:12.512
I'll take him from here.

02:19:12.679 --> 02:19:16.599
<i>For the future</i>
<i>is never truly set.</i>
