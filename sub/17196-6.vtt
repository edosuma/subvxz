(narrator)
previously, on <i>gracepoint...</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:21.220
(emmett)
100 bucks says
that's the boat they used,

00:21.222 --> 00:22.654
And those hairs belong
to danny solano.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.790
Hey, what are
you doing with that?

00:26.826 --> 00:28.394
You said
you were gonna stop.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.729
I know men who'd rape you.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.631
If you or your family
ever need to talk, call me.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.333
Where were you on the night
of danny's death?

00:34.335 --> 00:37.169
I was up late trying to write
a sermon, trying.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.738
I know about you
and gemma fisher.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.473
(emmett)
you can't tell
anyone about this.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.309
You listen to the doctors,
and you get some proper help.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.311
Do you have a conviction
for statutory rape?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.747
So you send me off
to question jack

00:48.749 --> 00:50.149
'cause you got something better?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.683
Your jack reinhold piece
is next.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.986
Yesterday I saw owen
talking to jack reinhold.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.320
He's got a history.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.555
They're gonna say
that I did it!

00:56.557 --> 00:57.956
I didn't do it!

01:32.859 --> 01:37.696
That camera has danny
passing by at 11:07.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.265
I'd put him at harvey ridge
around 11:35.

01:40.267 --> 01:44.403
Let's see how long this takes.
Be as precise as we can be.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.604
The later he gets to the hut,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.673
The smaller our window
for the murder.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.577
That sound good to you,
miller?

01:51.579 --> 01:53.645
I'm not sure "good"
is the word I'd use.

02:29.449 --> 02:32.351
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>I still want to know why jack</i>
<i>reinhold had danny's phone.</i>

02:32.353 --> 02:34.753
Did forensics get
anything off it?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.588
No, it got soaked
in the bottom of the kayak.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.657
Aw!
No data, no texts,
no call log.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.627
Two prints that match
our database, jack's and mark's.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.196
Mark touched the phone when jack
brought it over to the house,

02:44.198 --> 02:45.797
And jack found
the phone, so--

02:45.799 --> 02:47.599
Or claimed to 'cause
his prints were already on it.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.368
But here's what
I don't understand.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.170
I always thought that danny
had a smartphone

02:51.172 --> 02:52.804
Because tom was constantly
complaining

02:52.806 --> 02:54.640
That danny's phone
was better than his.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.608
So where is it?
Good question.

02:56.610 --> 03:00.779
Both mark and beth say
that he only had that old one.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.614
Think he bought it
on his own?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.384
He did have all that cash
in his room.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.785
Where from,
jack reinhold?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.655
Yeah, none of this fits.
Jack is 73.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.823
How would he get a body
two miles down the coast,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.158
Boat or no boat?

03:13.160 --> 03:16.195
Maybe he had an accomplice.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.463
Yeah.
[sighs]

03:18.465 --> 03:21.533
You talk to tom
at the end of the night?

03:21.535 --> 03:25.170
A little.
He was tired.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.572
He just wanted to go home.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.341
Tell him thanks for me.

03:29.343 --> 03:33.312
This was important,
timing the route.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.782
He did right by danny.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.891
Jack paid a visit
to the solanos on Sunday.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.493
He was pleading and begging
as they threw him out.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.829
Come on, owen, are we
doing this story together?

03:50.831 --> 03:51.897
What's that
supposed to mean?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.198
It means shared byline.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.700
Means a little bit
more money.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.402
I figured out I make about
400 bucks a story, on average.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.838
I'll give you 200,
cash.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.740
It might come in useful
with your mom.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.676
Wow.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.778
You really go
for the jugular.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.847
I thought I was trying
to help you out.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.627
Jack pled guilty
to the statutory rape charge.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.762
He admitted it?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.764
I was gonna bring it to kathy,
see what she thought.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.866
You're going to kathy
with it?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.035
I work for her.
Yeah, I know,

04:30.037 --> 04:31.403
And I know you respect her,

04:31.405 --> 04:32.904
But what do you think
she's gonna say?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.806
She's probably gonna say
that we should sit on it,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.108
Wait for jack to respond.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.143
And you already gave him
that chance.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.485
10:40, we write fast, we can
have something in by tomorrow.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.820
San francisco globe
or   <i>gracepoint journal,</i>

04:48.822 --> 04:50.188
Your choice.

04:52.892 --> 04:56.561
[reporter on tv]
an eerie silence enveloped
the town of gracepoint...

04:56.563 --> 04:59.665
We're on the news again.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.066
<i>To stage a reconstruction</i>
<i>along the route</i>

05:01.068 --> 05:03.068
<i>Where danny solano</i>
<i>was last seen</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:06.071
<i>The night before his body</i>
<i>was found beneath the cliffs.</i>

05:06.073 --> 05:08.440
Are we ever gonna
talk about it?

05:08.442 --> 05:10.075
By "it,"
you mean what you did?

05:12.912 --> 05:15.447
[turns tv off]

05:15.449 --> 05:18.016
[sighs]
I--

05:20.753 --> 05:26.391
I've been with you...
Since I was 16 years old, mark.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.728
What don't you get from me?

05:33.766 --> 05:36.268
Are you still
attracted to me?

05:36.270 --> 05:37.703
Of course I am.
Not of course!

05:37.705 --> 05:40.005
You slept with someone else!
Why?

05:41.541 --> 05:44.343
Am I not inventive enough
in bed?

05:44.345 --> 05:45.777
Is that it?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.479
That's not it.
What is it?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.848
Are you bored with me?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.817
No.
Then what?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.485
Maybe--
[sighs]

05:53.487 --> 05:56.288
Maybe it was the opposite.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.856
I don't know
what that means, mark.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.625
Maybe it's a part of you
that's bored with me,

06:00.627 --> 06:03.462
That wishes that life would have
been a little bit different,

06:03.464 --> 06:06.798
'cause I know you had ideas
about how life would be.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.700
Like, you have other plans.
You probably wouldn't have

06:08.702 --> 06:10.836
Even married me
if it wasn't for chloe.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.204
That isn't fair.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.505
I mean, but it's coming
from somewhere.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.840
Oh, god.
So now it's my fault?

06:14.842 --> 06:15.874
Hm.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.876
You're putting
what you did on me.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.411
No, that's not what I'm saying,
<i>not at all.</i>

06:28.921 --> 06:30.889
Gemma,
that was a surprise.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.194
To be wanted.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.598
And while you were out
enjoying your surprise,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.500
Our son died.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.068
You don't think I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

06:43.070 --> 06:45.170
Knowing that?

06:45.172 --> 06:48.073
Wishing that I was here?

06:48.075 --> 06:52.878
With danny, you,
at home?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.780
Well, you weren't.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.284
I really don't
want to lose you, beth.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.620
Mm.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.226
I feel like I already have.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.262
I'm pregnant.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.137
[sniffs]

07:20.940 --> 07:22.274
Well, you have to keep it.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.042
No, I don't have to do
anything.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.625
That'd be this way.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.161
Mm-hmm. Oh, here?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.163
No, stop it.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.865
I was joking.
I'm trying to sleep.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.533
Fine.
Go back to sleep.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.035
Mmm.
[sighs]

08:24.037 --> 08:25.770
First byline,
pretty exciting.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.706
Yeah, yeah.

08:30.142 --> 08:34.579
Ugh.
God, I need coffee.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.650
What?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.386
This is not what we wrote.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.504
Before you say anything--

08:59.506 --> 09:01.540
In the big leagues now,
huh?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.308
Shot straight to the top.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.210
Kathy...

09:06.345 --> 09:08.547
Apparently,
a promise to your editor,

09:08.549 --> 09:10.682
Your so-called mentor--
your words--

09:10.684 --> 09:13.018
Means nothing to you.
For this?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.319
Will you hear
me out, please?

09:14.321 --> 09:15.887
Pointing the finger
at an innocent man.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.489

I didn't write that!

Go on,
get out of my office.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.712
This is a first.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.282
Thought I'd stop by
on my way to work, say hi.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.051
You work too early.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.421
Nah, I work too much.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.724
Did owen send you
to check up on me?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.293
Do I need to check up
on you?

09:55.295 --> 09:58.129
Oh, don't do that.
Don't detective me.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.464
You all right, sara?

09:59.466 --> 10:02.300
I could be,

10:02.302 --> 10:04.703
If you felt like
helping me out a little.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.807
[scoffs]
you're unbelievable.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.309
Look, I got no furniture.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.944
A thousand bucks, 900?

10:12.946 --> 10:15.947
Oh, I've already given you
three times that much.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.617
It's not enough you're stealing
from your own son?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.885
Tell me what you did
with that money.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.623
No?

10:24.625 --> 10:28.827
God, I don't know why I even
bothered to stop by.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.696
I saw something, ell.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.132
I don't believe you.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.900
The night that danny
was killed.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.069
Do you even know
what night it was?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.538
It was a Thursday.

10:42.975 --> 10:48.947
All right.
Tell me what you saw.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.484
You lend me a thousand bucks,
I-I will.

10:52.486 --> 10:57.055
You need professional help,
sara.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.364
(vince)
he admitted it,
sex with a minor!

11:06.366 --> 11:08.466
He pled guilty,

11:08.468 --> 11:12.270
And we're still letting him go
count sea lions with our kids.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.506
You don't even have kids.
What does that matter?

11:14.508 --> 11:15.974
I spent the day in jail
because they thought

11:15.976 --> 11:18.610
I did something.
There's no real evidence yet.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.812
So we're just gonna wait around
until he does it again, huh?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.113
Till he hurts some other kid?

11:22.115 --> 11:25.283
How's that gonna fee--
enough!

11:25.285 --> 11:26.818
You don't think I've thought
about this?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.486
About him?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.889
About anyone else
in this town?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.490
I'm not a cop.
I can't do anything.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.359
If you want to work
yourself up, fine!

11:34.361 --> 11:38.430
You do what you want to do.
Just please stop hounding me!

11:46.005 --> 11:48.073
Is reinhold
a credible suspect?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.875
Close ties with danny
through the wildlife club,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.478
Plus no alibi for that night.
Also had danny's phone--

11:53.480 --> 11:55.580
One of them, at least--
in his possession.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.849
And a previous conviction
for sex with a minor.

11:57.851 --> 12:01.152
Except there's no sexual element
to danny's murder.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.420
That we know of.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.656
Who else?
Nothing more on our backpacker?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.591
Not till you get me
that warrant.

100 miles in each direction.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.730

some photos.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.198
So far, no one's seem him.

We're doing
a background check.

Tread lightly.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.415
Let's try not to pick
a fight with the church.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.351

it's not him then.

Doesn't feel right though.
It feels like I'm housing sharks

12:47.567 --> 12:49.400
That are just here to feed
on danny's murder.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.569
And I've got carver
staying here too, right?

12:51.571 --> 12:55.373
So it's just all
a little bit hairy.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.075
What?
What are you smiling at?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.610
Are you smiling
because I said, "hairy"?

12:58.612 --> 13:02.046
No, the--nothing hairy
about paying your bills.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.549
<i>(paul)</i>
<i>beth?</i>
<i>Beth, hi.</i>

13:04.551 --> 13:07.485
<i>(paul)</i>
<i>hey.</i>

13:07.487 --> 13:08.653
Hi, what can I
help you with?

13:08.655 --> 13:10.555
Oh.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.291
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.492
Beth, that's enough!

13:14.494 --> 13:15.960
Oh, that's enough?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.462
It was a mistake,
okay?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.831
Yeah, you're damned right
it was a mistake.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.501
I'm sor--beth, I am sorry!
I am so sorry about danny.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.571
Don't you dare
bring danny into it!

13:26.573 --> 13:27.906
You do not deserve
to say his name.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.174
Okay.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.676
You come near my family again,

13:31.678 --> 13:34.979
I swear to god, gemma,
I swear to god,

13:34.981 --> 13:38.483
You will regret
you ever moved here.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.152
Beth--

13:41.154 --> 13:44.489
Hey, beth, wait--
don't come after me, paul!

13:54.600 --> 13:57.669
[sighs]

14:03.375 --> 14:05.276
[door buzzer]

14:10.783 --> 14:13.484
I served my time.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.553
I never hurt danny.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.991
I never hurt a single child
in my life.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.827
You can make a complaint.
Call the paper.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.662
What would that do?
Probably nothing.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.497
[sighs]

14:26.499 --> 14:30.501
Better for you to cooperate,
help us clear your name.

14:30.503 --> 14:35.206
You think I haven't
heard that before?

14:35.208 --> 14:40.545
"help us and we'll help you,"
and the next thing I know,

14:40.547 --> 14:45.083
You're putting me in handcuffs
over something I didn't do.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.254
All I want, mr. Reinhold,
is to find out who killed danny.

14:49.256 --> 14:53.157
Well, I didn't do it,
and you know it.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.160
You don't have
a shred of evidence,

14:56.162 --> 15:01.432
And I made that perfectly clear
to owen burke.

15:01.434 --> 15:05.103
You have your partner
tell her nephew

15:05.105 --> 15:07.605
He'd better watch hisself.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.058
I told you
to stay away from me!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.761
Chlo,
give me a chance!

15:29.763 --> 15:31.729
I know I shouldn't have
taken danny with me.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.765
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>you hate me right now,</i>

15:33.767 --> 15:36.567
But I got something
I think you need to know,

15:36.569 --> 15:39.437
About jack reinhold.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.411
She was in the journal
building with you?

15:46.413 --> 15:49.881
I'd locked up for the night.
I don't know how she got in.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.583
She said she knew men
who'd rape me.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.485
She said what?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.955
I'm not saying this has
anything to do with danny.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.223
I told myself I wouldn't
interfere with your work.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.725
Kathy, that--

16:00.727 --> 16:03.261
Okay,
I will look into it.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.463
If she ever
bothers you again,

16:05.465 --> 16:08.299
You call me directly.
Okay?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.568
Thank you.
Of course.

16:10.570 --> 16:14.072
By the way,
you're not interfering.

16:14.074 --> 16:18.276
It's my nephew
who's interfering.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.811
I don't know
what he's thinking.

16:24.283 --> 16:27.285
I was in wildlife as a kid.
He was always reaching out,

16:27.287 --> 16:28.686
Putting his arm around us,

16:28.688 --> 16:30.888
Especially when we were
in our bathing suits.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.159
Jack put his hand
on my back once,

16:35.161 --> 16:37.795
And I knocked it off.
Told him leave me alone.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.664
He put his hand on you once,
or more than once?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.965
Well--
all the time.

16:40.967 --> 16:44.302
Chloe, let him answer.

16:44.304 --> 16:49.273
I can think of...
Four or five times.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.713
Hey, look, I want them
to catch whoever did this

16:55.715 --> 16:57.448
To danny, all right?

16:57.450 --> 16:58.783
You know,
I was in wildlife,

16:58.785 --> 17:01.185
And he never
put his hands on me.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.756
Show him.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.327
Three guys who were
in wildlife with me,

17:09.329 --> 17:11.829
<i>And their phone numbers.</i>

17:11.831 --> 17:13.564
They'll back him up,
every single one.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.735
You want to call them?
I'll write up

17:17.737 --> 17:19.137
What dean's saying?

17:21.673 --> 17:23.474
Nope.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.510
I think they should
take this to the police,

17:25.512 --> 17:27.412
Let them look into it,
not us.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.714
You gave me your number.
You said you would help.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.149
I know.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.484
You can handle this one
on your own.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.153
Another byline in <i>the globe,</i>
<i>some more cash.</i>

17:35.155 --> 17:36.821
You don't want that?

17:36.823 --> 17:40.625
No, not like this.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.561
[door bell jingling]

17:46.865 --> 17:49.067
You're absolutely certain
about everything you just said?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.702
Of course he is.

17:51.704 --> 17:55.173
(beth)
I just wanted to apologize,
not to her, to you.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.674
I can't believe I did that.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.909
No, you know what?
I can.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.078
I-I can believe it.
God, it felt good.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.413
Well--
do you think I have to pay her?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.781
I--no, no, no, no.
Well--

18:03.783 --> 18:05.183
I'm not paying her anything.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.618
She's the one
who did the damage.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.220
[sighs]

18:09.222 --> 18:10.788
Have you thought
about seeing anyone?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.223
A bereavement counselor?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.724
I don't want to see
a counselor, paul.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.626
A counselor will want me
to stop being angry.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.929
I need my anger.
It's all I've got right now.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.730
[sighs]

18:19.732 --> 18:21.866
Mark knows about me
being pregnant.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.869
He said I had to keep it.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.904
Well, I think he's right.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.439
[scoffs]
well, if the men think

18:28.441 --> 18:30.041
That's what's best--

18:30.043 --> 18:33.478
[laughing] hey, no.
That's what I was thinking.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.381
I hate it.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.485
This thing growing inside me,
I don't want it.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.621
It's not right.
Danny should just be growing.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.157
I am not done
with danny yet.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.825
I want him,
not something in his pla--

18:47.827 --> 18:49.660
Oh, beth, you--
I had one job as his mom,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.462
And I failed him!
Hey, hey, hey, beth.

18:51.464 --> 18:56.067
Beth, hey, look at me.
Hey, you didn't fail him, okay?

18:56.069 --> 18:59.270
You are a wonderful mother.
[scoffs]

18:59.272 --> 19:01.672
A wonderful woman.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.775
Look, we just--
we just have to find a way

19:04.777 --> 19:07.678
To lift you
out of his hopelessness.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.313
[scoffs]

19:09.315 --> 19:10.748
[laughs]

19:10.750 --> 19:12.283
Hey, have--have you
given more thought

19:12.285 --> 19:13.918
To the memorial service?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.154
Yeah, I want to do it,
but mark's still not sure.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.823
I think it could be beautiful.
Hey, hey.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.793
You know, we'd celebrate
danny's life,

19:22.795 --> 19:26.597
Give thanks for the time
we did have with him.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.100
You know, I have a feeling
it would get a lot of attention.

19:29.102 --> 19:32.904
You know, everyone in
the community will want to come.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.709
Hey, just let me--
let me do this for you.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.115
Still short.

19:44.117 --> 19:45.383
There's 200 there.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.884
200 will get you
half your fridge back.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.420
Which half you want?

19:51.723 --> 19:55.626
Listen, do--
do you deal in boats?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.045
(female)
jack? Jack reinhold?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.146
[photos snapping]
what?

20:15.148 --> 20:16.414
Over here.
Oh.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.748
Jack.
Jack.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.150
Just a few questions, jack.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.185
Stay in here.
They'll take off eventually.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.154
Oh, stay in here,
stay inside.

20:23.156 --> 20:26.557
Huh, carver?
That's your big answer to this?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.260
Clear them out of here!
I've got a shop to run!

20:29.262 --> 20:31.062
Not today you don't.
[sighs]

20:31.064 --> 20:33.064
Jack, I'm sorry,
we're stretched really thin,

20:33.066 --> 20:34.999
But maybe we can
send somebody by

20:35.001 --> 20:36.500
To make sure
things don't escalate.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.603
You're letting this go
on purpose!

20:38.605 --> 20:40.705
You're just hoping
that I'll snap,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.773
Say something
you want me to say!

20:42.775 --> 20:45.443
You're asking for help
but you won't talk to us!

20:45.445 --> 20:47.078
Hmm?
I can understand

20:47.080 --> 20:49.013
Why they think
you're hiding something.

20:52.284 --> 20:56.153
[chuckles]

20:57.189 --> 20:59.757
[sighs]

21:02.594 --> 21:07.965
I was a piano teacher,
and she was one of my students.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.568
No boys.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.937
Just a girl.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.774
A girl I loved.

21:20.545 --> 21:24.315
You guys can
fill in the gaps.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.816
You had sex
with one of your students?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.218
No, ellie.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.288
I had a relationship
with one of my students.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.989
You had sex how many times?

21:31.991 --> 21:36.160
What, do you think
I carved notches on my bedpost?

21:36.162 --> 21:38.129
Were you the one
to initiate it?

21:38.131 --> 21:40.498
It was a mutual attraction,
ellie.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.799
So who told the police?

21:41.801 --> 21:45.102
Her father.

21:45.104 --> 21:48.139
He followed us.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.074
Panicked.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.643
Called the cops.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.245
She fought with him.

21:54.247 --> 21:58.449
She tried to tell them,
but they couldn't hear it.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.752
They wanted to make
an example out of me.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.622
[sighs]

22:04.624 --> 22:10.027
So I served two years,
did my time.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.197
I was lucky to get out alive.

22:13.199 --> 22:19.003
Oh.
She was 16 and 11 months.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.972
Four more weeks,
and we'd have been fine.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.108
Why didn't you tell us
this earlier?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.844
Because it is
none of your business.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.714
It's my business only.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.315
Did you ever see
that girl again?

22:31.317 --> 22:35.653
See her?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.388
I married her.

22:39.691 --> 22:44.729
She was 18 and I was 40.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.467
Thanks very much.
Doing the right thing.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.168
Oh, joe, hey.
Oh, hey, jeff.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.903
Glad I caught you.
What's this?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.905
It's a petition,

22:54.907 --> 22:59.543
Against jack reinhold,
to kick him off wildlife.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.012
Why don't you go inside
and mail this for me, okay, man?

23:02.014 --> 23:06.117
Thanks.
[sighs]

23:14.059 --> 23:17.828
Hey, boy.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.563
He really likes you.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.998
What's his name?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.266
Archie.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.702
Archie, meet...

23:24.704 --> 23:27.104
Tom miller.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.206
You're the detective's kid.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.442
You like dogs, tom?

23:31.444 --> 23:35.880
Yeah, but my mom doesn't
let us have pets.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.883
You can take him for a walk
sometime if you want.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.585
Really?
Sure.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.688
He hates being cooped up
inside all day.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.090
Don't you, boy?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.859
I'm susan.
We're down by the water,

23:48.861 --> 23:51.929
Near the cliffs,
fifth trailer on the right.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.264
Okay.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.199
Come and knock
on my door sometime.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.534
Will you do that, tom?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.035
Yup.

23:58.037 --> 24:02.039
Fifth trailer on the right.
Anytime.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.319
Hey, what are you doing
to protect jack reinhold?

24:15.321 --> 24:17.054
Not your problem, mr. Coates.
We'll deal with it.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.657
Hey, he is a member
of the church.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.225
I spoke to him.
He's terrified.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.794
We're doing what we can.
Well, it isn't enough.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.463
There's a mob of press
outside of his shop.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.997
You'd rather they talk to you,
is that it?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.632
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:29.835 --> 24:31.569
Don't worry.
I'll deal with him.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.637
I'm sorry.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.778
Can I just say
for the record,

24:40.780 --> 24:42.580
Next time you have
a crime scene on the beach,

24:42.582 --> 24:45.082
Call another guy.
It's been a complete nightmare.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.152
We've eliminated 400 pieces
of evidence as irrelevant.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.688
What have you got
that's relevant?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.956
Cigarette butts?
All found

24:51.958 --> 24:54.091
Within a few feet
of danny's body.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.926
They'd have been there
a couple hours earlier,

24:55.928 --> 24:58.796
They would have washed away
at high tide, but they didn't.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.764
They were left there
that morning,

25:00.766 --> 25:02.600
Stubbed into the sand
around the same time

25:02.602 --> 25:04.001
The body was found.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.436
All the same brand.

25:05.438 --> 25:08.439
And high tar content.
Very unusual.

25:09.641 --> 25:12.176
Three cigarettes.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.278
What's wrong?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.281
Just all that way
to dump a body,

25:17.283 --> 25:20.150
And then stand there
and smoke?

25:20.152 --> 25:23.721
More important question:
Who smokes these cigarettes?

25:23.723 --> 25:26.824
(owen)
it was my dad's boat,
so it's probably a little rusty.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.660
Uh, which one?

25:29.662 --> 25:33.264
What's the problem?
You forget what it looks like?

25:35.467 --> 25:39.069
It's not here.

25:44.843 --> 25:47.378
Somebody must have taken it.

25:53.685 --> 25:57.755
Come on, sweet love.
Come on.

26:05.664 --> 26:06.697
When did you last
see the boat?

26:06.699 --> 26:09.066
Seven, eight weeks ago.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.367
With the motor
and everything?

26:10.369 --> 26:13.037
Yeah.
Just like dad always did it.

26:13.039 --> 26:16.106
By the way,
it wasn't insured, so...

26:19.878 --> 26:24.548
Okay.
Owen, I--

26:24.550 --> 26:26.850
Ooh, I went to see your mom
this morning,

26:26.852 --> 26:30.554
And I don't think
I did much good.

26:30.556 --> 26:32.690
She is a very troubled woman.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.258
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.894
Don't let her problems force you
into making decisions

26:36.896 --> 26:40.130
That you will come
to regret, okay?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.969
So what happens if it's
the boat that burned?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.591
Hey.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.894
Hey.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.963
I was just--
no, it's okay.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.734
You don't have to explain.

27:19.004 --> 27:22.473
I know about the baby.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.909
Were you listening
at the door?

27:25.911 --> 27:28.345
Mom sounded really angry.

27:29.848 --> 27:33.317
You have to make her
keep it.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.453
Yeah, I can't do that.
I wish I could, but--

27:36.455 --> 27:38.088
I'll talk to her.
No.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.124
You're not gonna talk to her.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.458
That's something
that me and your mother--

27:41.460 --> 27:44.261
I lost a brother.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.663
I don't care if this baby
was an accident.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.997
What do you think I was?

27:46.999 --> 27:51.268
[doorbell ringing]

27:51.270 --> 27:52.970
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.606
Is that why you're sitting
in danny's room?

27:55.608 --> 27:57.374
To make it easier?

27:57.376 --> 28:00.444
[knocking at the door]

28:05.016 --> 28:06.984
I didn't know
if I should come, uh,

28:06.986 --> 28:09.720
But a bunch of people are headed
over to jack's house.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.855
Vince is rallying up
a lynch mob.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.197
Jack reinhold!
Where you hiding, jack?

28:20.199 --> 28:21.832
Guys, come on, let's not do
anything stupid, all right?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.567
Ah, doug, we just want
to talk to him.

28:23.569 --> 28:24.635
There's nothing
wrong with that, right?

28:24.637 --> 28:26.170
Hey, reinhold!
[men yelling]

28:26.172 --> 28:27.538
Request for backup,
reinhold residence.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.572
Backup, over.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.140
<i>(vince)</i>
<i>come on out, jack!</i>

28:30.142 --> 28:32.409
[men yelling]

28:32.411 --> 28:33.977
Hey, reinhold!

28:33.979 --> 28:35.546
Why don't you put down
the kiddie porn

28:35.548 --> 28:37.715
And come talk to me
man-to-man?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.283
Jack!

28:45.857 --> 28:49.827
What would you know
about being a man, vince?

28:49.829 --> 28:50.861
A lot more than you,
you freak.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.196
Hey.
Why don't you put

28:52.198 --> 28:53.731
Your hands on me, huh?

28:53.733 --> 28:55.165
Put your hands on me, jack!
Hey, no, back off!

28:55.167 --> 28:56.533
Back off!
You told me to handle it,

28:56.535 --> 28:58.602
And I'm handling--
I said back off!

29:00.105 --> 29:02.773
[panting]

29:07.512 --> 29:10.514
They've been saying
a lot of things about you, jack.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.284
I'm not what
they're calling me.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.053
I didn't go near your boy.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.888
You had his phone though.

29:17.890 --> 29:22.292
He left it in the back
of a kayak, I swear to you.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.194
Yeah?
You've also been in prison.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.730
Underage kids, was it?
What am I supposed to think?

29:26.732 --> 29:28.799
What am I
supposed to think, jack?

29:34.739 --> 29:38.709
[sighs]
there was a girl.

29:38.711 --> 29:41.812
We had an affair.

29:41.814 --> 29:46.984
She was 16, the same age as beth
when you got her pregnant.

29:49.654 --> 29:54.892
Mark, we got married.
We had a son together.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.560
Well, then how come
they're not with you?

30:03.668 --> 30:07.504
Mark, he died
at nine years old.

30:07.506 --> 30:12.409
He was in a car accident.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.746
We tried, we tried
to put it back together.

30:15.748 --> 30:20.617
Grief just ripped us apart.

30:20.619 --> 30:25.455
They're saying that, uh,
I wanted to be near boys

30:25.457 --> 30:29.760
Because I'm a pedophile.

30:29.762 --> 30:34.665
Nah, that's not it.
I miss my son.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.634
I miss him so much.

30:37.636 --> 30:41.338
I mean, you know,
what kind of a world is this

30:41.340 --> 30:44.975
Where it's wrong for a man
to seek affection?

30:44.977 --> 30:49.713
I would never,
ever hurt danny.

30:49.715 --> 30:54.151
Never.

30:54.153 --> 30:58.956
You know, mark, we're the same,
in a way.

31:01.226 --> 31:05.796
No parent should ever
outlive their child.

31:09.234 --> 31:13.670
Your son,
he was a good boy,

31:13.672 --> 31:17.741
A really good boy.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.878
You okay, mark?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.479
Yeah.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.882
Why don't you guys
just go home, man?

31:24.884 --> 31:26.516
What do you mean go home?
What's he saying to you?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.218
Just go home!

31:32.357 --> 31:35.859
You got to leave.
It's not safe for you here.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.995
This is my home now.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.930
But you can make
another place your home.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.766
I mean, the people have
made up their minds about you.

31:42.768 --> 31:46.136
If you want to be safe,
move far, far away from here.

32:11.029 --> 32:12.095
Ellie?

32:12.097 --> 32:14.798
[groans]
hey, hugo, I just--

32:14.800 --> 32:16.233
The picture you gave me
of that boat?

32:16.235 --> 32:17.768
Mm.
It's a match

32:17.770 --> 32:18.902
With the one we got.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.938
Color, molding.
It's looking likely.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.039
Really?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.540
I still need to confirm,

32:23.542 --> 32:25.375
But with danny's blood
on the burned one,

32:25.377 --> 32:30.113
If it is a match,
we're there, one step away.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.517
Oh, okay.

32:35.820 --> 32:39.923
Hey, uh, you feel like
grabbing a drink?

32:39.925 --> 32:42.993
What, you--
do you mean...

32:42.995 --> 32:44.895
Just you--you and me?

32:44.897 --> 32:47.064
[laughs]
yeah.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.100
Oh.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.837
Well, hugo,
I'm--I'm married.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.440
So that's a deal-breaker
for you?

32:56.442 --> 32:58.909
Well, yeah, hugo.
I'm happily married.

32:58.911 --> 33:02.913
All right.
That's fair.

33:02.915 --> 33:05.916
Lots of people are
happily married though, no?

33:05.918 --> 33:08.352
Hugo, I'm actually
happily married.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.254
Okay.
Okay.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.589
Must be nice.
Yeah, it is.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.257
It's really nice.

33:14.259 --> 33:17.094
You want anything?
A cup of coffee, or--

33:17.096 --> 33:19.296
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good on coffee, thanks.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.565
Okay.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.975
Did danny know?

33:31.977 --> 33:33.343
Danny know wha--

33:33.345 --> 33:35.679
About you and gemma,
did he know?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.114
No, he didn't know.

33:41.319 --> 33:44.121
What were you doing?

33:44.123 --> 33:45.222
Nothing, I'm ju--

33:45.224 --> 33:46.690
You were emailing her?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.860
No, I--
I wouldn't do that.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.796
I-I said it's over.
I'm--it's over.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.064
Were you reading the news?
Because I don't want us

33:54.066 --> 33:55.799
To do that.
I can't stand it anymore.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.469
No, I'm--

33:59.471 --> 34:05.542
I'm looking at pictures,
at baby pictures of danny.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.415
After you told me, I just--

34:11.417 --> 34:14.084
Okay, stop.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.720
I can't help it.
Mark--

34:16.722 --> 34:18.989
I'm not pressuring you.
[sighs]

34:18.991 --> 34:22.426
I'm really not.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.795
I just want to look at my boy.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.002
I just want to spend
five minutes with him,

34:32.004 --> 34:35.505
Just five minutes.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.912
So, uh, this is a little odd,
but the--

34:41.914 --> 34:46.116
Our burned boat, it belonged
to my brother-in-law,

34:46.118 --> 34:49.352
Owen's dad.

34:49.354 --> 34:52.556
He's been, um,
out of the picture for a while.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.758
He took off for florida,
so, um--

34:54.760 --> 34:59.096
The boat that was burned
with danny's dna

34:59.098 --> 35:00.864
Was your brother-in-law's?

35:00.866 --> 35:03.733
It was left on shore.
It was chained to a post.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.569
Anyone with bolt cutters
could have--

35:05.571 --> 35:09.206
Who knew it was there?
Owen, my sister,

35:09.208 --> 35:11.041
Anyone else who keeps
a boat there.

35:11.043 --> 35:12.375
Did danny know?

35:12.377 --> 35:15.779
I'm not sure.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.216
Okay, check that your
brother-in-law wasn't

35:19.218 --> 35:21.218
Back for a visit.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.153
See if hugo can get
any other prints off the shards.

35:23.155 --> 35:26.056
Match them against
all the elimination prints.

35:26.058 --> 35:31.394
Well, uh, okay,
but, um, sir,

35:31.396 --> 35:36.399
Uh, would you mind
asking hugo for me?

35:36.401 --> 35:38.602
Me?
Yeah.

35:38.604 --> 35:42.272
He actually just made
a pass at me.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.074
Why did he do that?

35:44.076 --> 35:45.976
Thank you very much.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.110
You're married.
I know.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.079
He--he knows that.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.081
[groans]

35:51.083 --> 35:52.349
A fling with a crime scene
investigator

35:52.351 --> 35:53.683
Could be interesting.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.352
What?
What--what does that mean?

35:55.354 --> 35:56.686
Attention to detail.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.121
Used to having
their hands everywhere.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.923
Okay, that's gross.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.358
Dirty hugo.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.760
That's so gross.
That is nasty.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.030
Thank you for that visual,
by the way.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.765
You're welcome.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.403
[ellie sighs]

36:16.474 --> 36:18.108
Sir?

36:18.110 --> 36:19.476
Yeah?

36:19.478 --> 36:23.947
What if we don't
close this case?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.615
If we don't find
danny's killer?

36:25.617 --> 36:26.950
We will.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.085
But you didn't in rosemont.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.960
How long have you been waiting
to bring that up?

36:36.962 --> 36:38.962
I haven't been waiting.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.230
Rosemont was different.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.698
<i>How?</i>

36:41.700 --> 36:43.366
Well, you've really been
holding this in, huh?

36:48.206 --> 36:51.208
A mistake was made.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.143
A big mistake.

36:53.145 --> 36:54.911
By you?

36:54.913 --> 36:57.781
Thank you for the visit,
miller, good night.

37:00.484 --> 37:04.321
Sir...

37:04.323 --> 37:08.391
I've known these people
all my life.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.161
They're my friends.

37:11.163 --> 37:12.929
I can't let them down.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.898
We won't.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.402
[soft piano music]

37:19.404 --> 37:27.477
â™ª

38:55.599 --> 38:57.567
[knocking at the door]

38:59.837 --> 39:01.438
Hi. Hi.
Hi.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.840
I saw you come back in.
I hope this is okay.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.275
Oh, come in.
<i>Thanks.</i>

39:08.646 --> 39:10.947
There you go.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.384
Uh, so I've got
a lot of press staying here,

39:14.386 --> 39:16.553
And I kind of figured out that
isn't the best for you, right?

39:16.555 --> 39:19.723
Bumping into them,
et cetera, et cetera?

39:19.725 --> 39:22.625
But all my normal bookings
have canceled, sadly,

39:22.627 --> 39:24.394
And I don't want
to inconvenience you,

39:24.396 --> 39:25.962
But I'd really like
to try and make it through

39:25.964 --> 39:29.532
Till the spring,
if that's even possible.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.536
Sorry, are you asking me
a question?

39:33.538 --> 39:38.007
No.
Uh, sort of.

39:38.009 --> 39:42.245
I want to offer you a deal...
As an apology.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.814
I'll charge the department
half the price for your room,

39:44.816 --> 39:46.583
And you can consider it
my contribution

39:46.585 --> 39:48.818
To the investigation.

39:50.421 --> 39:52.055
You like me
staying here that much?

39:52.057 --> 39:54.324
Well, I've had worse guests.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.761
It must be really hard
running a place like this.

39:57.763 --> 40:01.498
Oh.
You have no idea.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.869
You ever get to relax?

40:05.871 --> 40:09.773
Yeah.
Well...I have my ways.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.509
[both chuckle]

40:15.679 --> 40:21.451
So would you like to relax
a bit with me here tonight?

40:21.453 --> 40:22.685
Oh, god, no.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.421
Oh.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.722
That didn't come out...
No, no.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.290
The way I wanted that
to come out.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.225
I misunderstood, that's okay.
What I meant is that I--

40:29.227 --> 40:31.694
It's not that I wouldn't
or that you're--

40:31.696 --> 40:33.096
Of course.
I ju--I wouldn't want

40:33.098 --> 40:35.265
To worry.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.399
Worry about?

40:36.401 --> 40:38.234
Worry that you'd
pass out on me.

40:38.236 --> 40:43.106
Oh.
Okay.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.541
Excellent.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.777
Sorry.

40:54.952 --> 40:58.388
Actually, have you even told
anybody that you're ill yet?

40:58.390 --> 41:00.924
<i>'cause I think you should.</i>
<i>I mean, maybe your boss</i>

41:00.926 --> 41:02.559
Or ellie or--
I don't want to be

41:02.561 --> 41:04.060
The only person
knowing about this.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.929
If you want to try to help,
make a contribution

41:05.931 --> 41:08.932
To the investigation,
leave it alone.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.333
Let me finish my work.

41:10.335 --> 41:11.601
Well, what if you
keel over again?

41:11.603 --> 41:13.236
I'm not going to.
But you already have.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.571
I'm not going to.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.139
I have a job to finish, so...

41:16.141 --> 41:18.007
<i>Okay then.</i>
<i>Yup, I'll...</i>

41:18.009 --> 41:21.444
Let you finish your, uh--

41:21.446 --> 41:23.012
Okay.
[clears throat]

41:24.181 --> 41:26.182
Good night.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.684
[door closing]

42:10.728 --> 42:15.765
Our father,
who art in heaven...

42:36.353 --> 42:42.191
[phone buzzing]

42:42.193 --> 42:43.726
[groans]

42:47.898 --> 42:51.734
Yeah?
