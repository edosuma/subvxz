Hey, good morning, Mama Lisa.

11:07.815 --> 11:09.784
You know I had to come see about

11:09.784 --> 11:12.220
- She's good.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.488
Of course, I'm sure.

Okay, well, good.

11:14.822 --> 11:16.557
What's, what's going on?

11:16.557 --> 11:17.959
Nothing.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.427
Is everything okay at the shop?

11:19.427 --> 11:21.262

11:59.634 --> 12:02.036
And put it in the closet when

12:02.036 --> 12:03.538
Yes, ma'am.

12:03.538 --> 12:05.406

I actually feel really good.

12:25.159 --> 12:26.594
- You look it.

12:26.594 --> 12:28.462
Hold on, girl.

12:28.462 --> 12:31.032
Hey, Black.

12:31.032 --> 12:33.434

12:35.870 --> 12:37.905
Boy, Imma call you back.

12:37.905 --> 12:39.340
Bye.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.741
[clears throat]

12:44.212 --> 12:47.715
Okay, well, I had to come see if
you were alright.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.116
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.585
I'm actually feeling really
good.

12:50.585 --> 12:52.153
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:52.153 --> 12:53.521
What you doin'?

12:53.521 --> 12:57.024
Oh, just, um, writing a letter.

12:57.024 --> 13:00.161
Oh, to who?

13:00.161 --> 13:01.662
Pam, sit.

13:03.764 --> 13:06.267
What's going on?

13:06.267 --> 13:10.404
Well, I just wanted to apologize
to you for last night.

13:12.506 --> 13:16.978
I know you was just checking to
make sure I was alright.

13:16.978 --> 13:18.546
Are we having a breakthrough
moment?

13:18.546 --> 13:19.981
Because I really was.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.085
I'm sorry.

13:24.085 --> 13:27.388
I don't know what's going on
these days.

13:27.388 --> 13:29.390
It's fine.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.092
Well, you look better.

13:31.092 --> 13:32.994
I'm telling you, I feel fine.

13:32.994 --> 13:35.029
But my mama won't let me do
nothing.

13:35.029 --> 13:36.664
She won't even let me out.

13:36.664 --> 13:38.799
Girl, enjoy that while you can.

13:38.799 --> 13:40.201
I know, right.

13:43.271 --> 13:45.706
What?

13:45.706 --> 13:51.545
Pam, did you tell Aaron I was at
the hospital?

13:51.545 --> 13:54.582
Girl, you know me.

13:54.582 --> 13:56.350
Then how did he know?

13:56.350 --> 13:57.718
I don't know.

13:59.921 --> 14:04.558
Didn't you say he know a doctor
that worked down there?

14:04.558 --> 14:06.827
Oh shit.

14:06.827 --> 14:08.663
That's right.

14:08.663 --> 14:10.464
She must've told him.

14:10.464 --> 14:12.967
Oh, no she didn't.

14:12.967 --> 14:17.371
Ain't that against the, the hip,
hip hop law?

14:17.371 --> 14:21.175
Pam, HIPPA law, the HIPPA.

14:21.175 --> 14:23.444
You know what I mean.
Hip hop, whatever.

14:23.444 --> 14:24.812
But ain't it against the law?

14:24.812 --> 14:26.714
Yes, it is.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.950
Oh, that bitch.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.185
That's why he didn't want to
tell me.

14:31.185 --> 14:33.087
And I just, ugh.

14:33.087 --> 14:35.690
- You what?
- Nothing.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.359
Karen Mott, what did you do?

14:38.359 --> 14:40.361
I said nothing.

14:40.361 --> 14:44.665
Now Pam, can you please just be
sure to you know.

14:44.665 --> 14:46.934
I got the salon.

14:46.934 --> 14:49.837
You know I have to check after
you and make sure.

14:49.837 --> 14:52.139
Karen, I got it.

14:54.275 --> 14:56.143
Okay.

14:56.143 --> 14:59.814
But listen, call me every night

14:59.814 --> 15:02.416
to make sure everything is done,
okay?

15:02.416 --> 15:03.884
Okay.

15:03.884 --> 15:06.721
But how long are you gonna be
out?

15:06.721 --> 15:08.055
I'm hoping just the week.

15:08.055 --> 15:10.591
Oh, I can work with that.

15:10.591 --> 15:12.793
Now, here, write this down.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.562
Things you gotta check.
Come on.

15:14.562 --> 15:16.263
I know, Karen.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.733
Okay, but I want you to write it
down so you have it.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.301
But I got it.

15:20.301 --> 15:21.635
Go ahead.

15:21.635 --> 15:23.004
Okay.

15:23.004 --> 15:26.107
Turn the curlers off.

15:26.107 --> 15:29.477
Okay, don't stop there 'cause
there's more.

15:29.477 --> 15:30.845
Come on.

15:30.845 --> 15:32.446
Girl.

15:32.446 --> 15:34.782
Fill up the bottles, shampoo and
conditioner, deep, come on.

15:34.782 --> 15:36.684
You know I can't type that fast.

15:36.684 --> 15:40.354
Give me the phone, Pam.
I'll do it.

15:40.354 --> 15:41.789
You ain't...

15:41.789 --> 15:43.391
You ain't even typed nothing,
Pam.

15:48.571 --> 15:51.741
[phone vibrates]

15:51.741 --> 15:53.042
Hello.

15:53.042 --> 15:54.944
Hello, Aaron.

15:54.944 --> 15:56.979
Is this the accountant?

15:56.979 --> 15:58.447
I'm sorry.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.049
[Lisa]<i> This is Karen's mother.</i>

16:00.049 --> 16:02.218
Oh, hi.

16:02.218 --> 16:04.720

16:08.691 --> 16:12.228
[Lisa]<i> I need you to be here at
her house at 8 o'clock.</i>

16:12.228 --> 16:14.597
- Okay.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.332
[Aaron]<i> Oh beautiful, well,

16:16.332 --> 16:19.368
- [Lisa]<i> Don't be late.

16:19.368 --> 16:22.605
And please do not stress her
out.

16:22.605 --> 16:24.774
[Aaron]<i> No, you have my word
that I will not.</i>

16:24.774 --> 16:27.910
And just so you know, I'm also
inviting Zac.

16:27.910 --> 16:29.845
He'll also be here.

16:29.845 --> 16:31.280
He will?

16:31.280 --> 16:33.416
[Lisa]<i> Yeah.</i>

16:33.416 --> 16:35.818
Uh, okay.

16:35.818 --> 16:37.253
What?

16:37.253 --> 16:39.221
I mean, do you think that's a
good idea?

16:39.221 --> 16:40.856
'Cause he really stresses her
out.

16:40.856 --> 16:43.993
[Lisa]<i> There will be no drama.</i>

16:43.993 --> 16:47.363
- Okay.

16:47.363 --> 16:48.764
[Aaron]<i> Alright, see you then.</i>

16:48.764 --> 16:50.232
Bye.

16:58.274 --> 16:59.842
[Zac]<i> What's up?</i>

16:59.842 --> 17:01.477
Hey, you know who this is?

17:01.477 --> 17:03.179

17:03.179 --> 17:05.281
[Lisa]<i> Alright, I need you to be

17:05.281 --> 17:08.317
<i>- tonight at 8 o'clock.
- Wait, what?</i>

17:08.317 --> 17:10.953
I need to talk to you and the
accountant.

17:10.953 --> 17:12.254
[Zac]<i> The accountant?</i>

17:12.254 --> 17:15.224
Uh, the preacher.

17:15.224 --> 17:17.026
Ms. Lisa, I.

17:17.026 --> 17:20.496
[Lisa]<i> Look, are you coming?</i>

17:20.496 --> 17:23.032
Alright, let me, let me talk to
my girl first.

17:23.032 --> 17:24.900
Oh yeah, what's her number?

17:24.900 --> 17:26.368
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

17:26.368 --> 17:29.271
We, we are not doing that.
That we not doing.

17:29.271 --> 17:33.008
[Lisa]<i> No, seriously, she should
be here too.</i>

17:33.008 --> 17:36.412
Ms. Lisa, that is not the best.

17:36.412 --> 17:40.616
Look, I can't let Karen be
stressed out anymore.

17:40.616 --> 17:42.918
I, I'm telling you right now,

17:42.918 --> 17:45.421
if my girl come over there, she
gonna be stressed out.

17:45.421 --> 17:47.523
Let me ask her anyway.

17:47.523 --> 17:49.692
[Zac]<i> Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll do it.</i>

17:49.692 --> 17:54.797
Alright, you do it and then the

17:54.797 --> 17:56.599
Ms. Lisa, she not coming over

17:56.599 --> 17:58.567
[Lisa]<i> Fine, well, ask her
anyway.</i>

17:58.567 --> 18:01.637
And even if she doesn't come you
be sure you're here.

18:01.637 --> 18:04.206
Fine, I'll, I'll let you know.

18:04.206 --> 18:05.975
[Lisa]<i> No, you won't let me
know.</i>

18:05.975 --> 18:08.844
<i>You'll be here, 8 o'clock.</i>

18:08.844 --> 18:10.212
Alright, Ms. Lisa.

18:10.212 --> 18:12.181
[Lisa]<i> Okay, see you then.</i>

18:12.181 --> 18:13.682
I'll talk to you later.

18:13.682 --> 18:16.552
Bye.

18:16.552 --> 18:17.753
[sighs]

18:29.298 --> 18:30.833
- Danni.
- [Danni]<i> Hey.</i>

18:30.833 --> 18:32.301
Hey.

18:32.301 --> 18:34.103
[Andi]<i> Girl, I just got into the
office.</i>

18:34.103 --> 18:35.604
- Andi.
- [Andi]<i> I'm doing all I can.</i>

18:35.604 --> 18:37.973
I, I know, but Calvin said he
has 20 grand

18:37.973 --> 18:39.308
to put toward the bail.

18:39.308 --> 18:40.809
Oh, that's good.

18:40.809 --> 18:44.213
But we don't even know if bail
has been granted yet.

18:44.213 --> 18:45.915
Well, shit.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.283
[Andi]<i> Yeah.</i>

18:47.283 --> 18:49.685
Okay, have you talked to Robin?

18:49.685 --> 18:50.953
No, but,

18:53.822 --> 18:56.926
his office door is open.

18:56.926 --> 18:58.994
I think he's in a meeting.

18:58.994 --> 19:00.930
[Danni]<i> Go, go in there.</i>

19:00.930 --> 19:02.364
Danni, he is in a meeting.

19:02.364 --> 19:04.099
He's in with someone.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.802
Andi, Sabrina's in jail.

19:06.802 --> 19:08.304
Go in there.

19:08.304 --> 19:10.739
Danni, I will talk to him after
his meeting.

19:10.739 --> 19:12.641
- And I will let you know, okay?
- [Danni]<i> Andi.</i>

19:12.641 --> 19:14.009
Listen, stop stressing me out.

19:14.009 --> 19:15.678
- I'm already stressed enough.
- [Danni]<i> Andi.</i>

19:15.678 --> 19:16.946
Bye.

19:20.649 --> 19:23.886
Danni,

19:23.886 --> 19:25.321
this is Quincy.

19:25.321 --> 19:27.256
He's gonna be taking Zac's
place.

19:27.256 --> 19:28.891
Oh, hello.
That's great.

19:28.891 --> 19:32.761
Now look, all you do is grab the
bags, drop passengers off.

19:32.761 --> 19:34.096
Okay?

19:34.096 --> 19:36.398
If you have any problems, Danni
or anyone at the gate

19:36.398 --> 19:38.067
- can take care of it, alright?
- Okay, thank you.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.135
Alright, now, I'm gonna go get
your paperwork.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.670
Just wait here and talk to her.

19:46.308 --> 19:48.277
So, how you doing?

19:48.277 --> 19:50.312
Fine.

19:50.312 --> 19:52.247
You like working here?

19:52.247 --> 19:54.416
It's a job.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.652
I probably feel the same way.

19:56.652 --> 19:59.154
Maybe so.

19:59.154 --> 20:02.257
So, does it get busy.

20:02.257 --> 20:04.159
Yep, around the holidays.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.527
Yeah, pretty busy.

20:05.527 --> 20:08.097
So, it's not busy right now?

20:08.097 --> 20:09.765
Hey, so, you know, listen.

20:09.765 --> 20:12.601
I'm really stressed out today,
you know,

20:12.601 --> 20:18.040
and, uh, the thing about it is.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.441
Can you?

20:19.441 --> 20:21.076
Yeah, my bad.
I'm sorry.

20:21.076 --> 20:22.511
[Danni]<i> Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

20:22.511 --> 20:25.080
It's okay, it's okay.
But I hope you have a good day.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.949
Thank you, I appreciate that.

20:26.949 --> 20:28.651
You should, as beautiful as you
are.

20:28.651 --> 20:31.086
- [whispers] Oh shit.
- What?

20:31.086 --> 20:32.955
Can you not, can you not?

20:32.955 --> 20:34.356
What?

20:34.356 --> 20:37.292
Can you just go over there and
not?

20:37.292 --> 20:39.528
What you don't believe me?

20:39.528 --> 20:42.498
You never had nobody tell you
that?

20:42.498 --> 20:45.000
See, I have customers coming,
right?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.336
- Yeah.
- Passengers.

20:47.336 --> 20:50.439
Duty calls.

20:50.439 --> 20:52.975
Thank you for flying Higher
Airlines.

20:52.975 --> 20:55.411
Thank you for flying Higher
Airlines. Thank you.

20:55.411 --> 20:57.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:57.379 --> 20:58.781
- How are you?
- I'm good.

20:58.781 --> 21:02.084
- How is your son?
- Oh, he's good.

21:02.084 --> 21:03.452
Is she coming on a broomstick?

21:03.452 --> 21:04.987
'Cause I'd like to.

21:04.987 --> 21:07.523
No, no, she's not.

21:07.523 --> 21:11.527
Um, look, I, I gotta get back to
work but uh,

21:11.527 --> 21:13.362
sorry about that.

21:13.362 --> 21:16.231
No, it's no problem.
No problem.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.500
Call me about dinner.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.002
Yeah, maybe.

21:25.474 --> 21:27.176
Hey, Calvin, I haven't heard
anything.

21:27.176 --> 21:28.544
[Calvin]<i> Alright, I'm sorry.</i>

21:28.544 --> 21:30.546
<i>It's just that I'm so worried
about her.</i>

21:30.546 --> 21:32.448
No, I know.
You really care about her, huh?

21:32.448 --> 21:34.316
[Calvin]<i> Are you kidding me?
Of course I do.</i>

21:34.316 --> 21:36.118
Yeah, yeah, y'all've been
through a lot.

21:36.118 --> 21:38.220
[Calvin]<i> Yeah, I know.</i>

21:38.220 --> 21:40.723
Well, um, I'll let you know.
Yeah?

21:40.723 --> 21:42.524
- [Calvin]<i> Okay.
- Okay.</i>

21:42.524 --> 21:44.126
[Calvin]<i> I won't call again.</i>

21:44.126 --> 21:45.561
Unless you...

21:45.561 --> 21:47.262
[Calvin]<i> Unless I hear something
first.</i>

21:47.262 --> 21:48.630
Alright.

21:48.630 --> 21:50.199
- [Calvin]<i> Okay.
- Okay.</i>

21:50.199 --> 21:51.633
[Calvin]<i> Thank you, Danni.</i>

21:52.667 --> 21:58.373
[music]

22:03.644 --> 22:06.347
Uh, Fatima?

22:06.347 --> 22:07.815
Hey.

22:10.551 --> 22:12.820
Do you see who's here?

22:12.820 --> 22:14.355
Yeah, I saw him this morning.

22:19.594 --> 22:23.865
Um, what exactly are you doing?

22:23.865 --> 22:25.867
I am working on centering
myself.

22:25.867 --> 22:29.904
It's a new exercise I'm trying
out.

22:29.904 --> 22:35.042
What are you centering yourself
for, exactly?

22:35.042 --> 22:36.811
Nothing, I'm, I'm almost there.

22:40.114 --> 22:43.317
Are you okay?
Can I help?

22:43.317 --> 22:47.321
Girl, you asking too many
questions.

22:47.321 --> 22:49.323
What's wrong?

22:49.323 --> 22:50.725
Karen.

22:50.725 --> 22:52.260
- [Andi]<i> Oh.
- Mmhmm.</i>

22:52.260 --> 22:57.265
Yeah, your girl called and
cussed me out last night.

22:57.265 --> 22:58.733
Why?

22:58.733 --> 23:00.301
Called me all kinds of bitches.

23:00.301 --> 23:02.203
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

23:02.203 --> 23:04.705
Andi, I told Zac he better
handle that shit.

23:04.705 --> 23:07.175
Okay, well, why would she do
that?

23:07.175 --> 23:08.643
I don't know.

23:08.643 --> 23:10.044
Does she need a reason?

23:12.180 --> 23:14.182
I've been trying to get in touch
with her.

23:14.182 --> 23:16.317
I, I just, I feel like a lot is
going on

23:16.317 --> 23:18.820
- and maybe she's just...
- Tripping.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.254
Tripping is what she's doing.

23:20.254 --> 23:26.227
I wouldn't use those terms but
I'm sorry.

23:26.227 --> 23:30.064
Andi, what makes matters worse
is

23:30.064 --> 23:32.533
Zac and I were having an
argument today

23:32.533 --> 23:34.569
and he called me by her name.

23:34.569 --> 23:38.172
- Oh hell no.
- Yes, and Andi.

23:38.172 --> 23:39.540
Okay.

23:39.540 --> 23:41.375
Okay, what did you do?

23:41.375 --> 23:43.911
I started having flashbacks of
all the shit my ex did.

23:43.911 --> 23:45.780
That's first.

23:45.780 --> 23:47.815
I can understand that.

23:47.815 --> 23:50.218
And then I almost -- out on
the --.

23:50.218 --> 23:54.455
Fatima, you know Zac is not your
ex.

23:54.455 --> 23:55.957
Andi, I know that.

23:55.957 --> 23:58.392
But this shit right here.

23:58.392 --> 23:59.694
I can't do it.

23:59.694 --> 24:01.095
I can't.

24:01.095 --> 24:02.497
You can.
This is love.

24:02.497 --> 24:04.732
- [Fatima]<i> No.
- This is the process.</i>

24:04.732 --> 24:08.503
Andi, he is still in love with
her.

24:08.503 --> 24:10.571
I don't think he is.

24:10.571 --> 24:12.373
Andi, he says he's not.

24:12.373 --> 24:16.677
But anytime that girl's name
comes up Zac gets so mad.

24:16.677 --> 24:18.279
And one thing I know,

24:18.279 --> 24:21.082
is if someone cause you to have
all that emotion

24:21.082 --> 24:22.884
you still feel something for
'em.

24:22.884 --> 24:25.253
But one thing I know is those
emotions

24:25.253 --> 24:27.388
can come from a trauma bond.

24:27.388 --> 24:31.359
They were together for three
years.

24:31.359 --> 24:33.694
I know that.

24:33.694 --> 24:37.598
Karen is still doing some
healing.

24:37.598 --> 24:42.370
But it is painfully obvious that
Zac is over her.

24:42.370 --> 24:45.072
And only into you.

24:45.072 --> 24:48.509
But why can't I shake this
feeling?

24:48.509 --> 24:50.011
Time.

24:50.011 --> 24:52.947
You just need more time.

24:52.947 --> 24:54.615
Yeah, time, I guess.

24:54.615 --> 24:57.218
Speaking of time, you're still
on the clock.

24:57.218 --> 25:00.454
Um, the Burma file, remember
that?

25:00.454 --> 25:03.190
Shit, yes, I am at work.

25:03.190 --> 25:04.592
At work.

25:04.592 --> 25:06.928
Yes, I got it right here.

25:06.928 --> 25:08.429
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

25:08.429 --> 25:10.965
Thanks girl.

25:10.965 --> 25:12.567
See you later.
Thank you for that.

25:12.567 --> 25:14.001
Of course.

25:20.474 --> 25:25.546
[phone vibrating]

25:28.049 --> 25:30.051
- Karen!
- Hey.

25:30.051 --> 25:31.819
[Andi]<i> Um, where have you been?</i>

25:31.819 --> 25:34.689
I, uh, had to go to the doctor.

25:34.689 --> 25:36.157
What?

25:36.157 --> 25:38.492
[Karen]<i> I was spotting so, yeah.</i>

25:38.492 --> 25:39.994
Oh my God, are you okay?

25:39.994 --> 25:41.495
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

25:41.495 --> 25:43.531
But they just, they put me on
bedrest.

25:43.531 --> 25:46.767
And you know, they don't want me
to stress.

25:46.767 --> 25:48.703
Okay, I'm coming over.

25:48.703 --> 25:51.005
[Karen]<i> No, no, no, no, no, no,
my mom's here.</i>

25:51.005 --> 25:52.673
<i>So, I'm fine.</i>

25:52.673 --> 25:54.141
Why are you whispering?

25:54.141 --> 25:56.344
Well, I had to sneak to call
you.

25:56.344 --> 25:59.013
She don't want me talking to
nobody.

25:59.013 --> 26:00.514
[Andi]<i> That's Lisa.</i>

26:00.514 --> 26:03.818
Yeah, she's got me locked in
this room with my feet up.

26:03.818 --> 26:05.286
Just sitting here.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.922
Wait, are you sure you okay?

26:07.922 --> 26:09.890
[Karen]<i> Yes, I'm fine.</i>

26:09.890 --> 26:11.292
Okay, well that's good.

26:11.292 --> 26:15.229
Mmhmm.
So, how's things in your world?

26:17.832 --> 26:19.433
Nothing.

26:19.433 --> 26:21.002
[Karen]<i> Andi, you gotta tell me
something.</i>

26:21.002 --> 26:22.536
No, it's nothing.

26:22.536 --> 26:23.904
It's boring over here.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.773
Okay, I'm gonna go crazy in this
room.

26:25.773 --> 26:27.141
I ain't doing nothing.

26:27.141 --> 26:28.976
Well, how long have you been in
the room?

26:28.976 --> 26:30.378
[Karen]<i> Not even a day.</i>

26:30.378 --> 26:32.680
Well, I mean, you really do need
your rest.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.549
I know.
I know.

26:35.549 --> 26:37.385
[sighs]

26:37.385 --> 26:38.986
I'm trying.

26:38.986 --> 26:40.554
[Andi]<i> Yeah, 'cause you been
really...</i>

26:40.554 --> 26:44.725
I know, okay?
I know, don't say it.

26:44.725 --> 26:46.260
Okay.

26:46.260 --> 26:47.995
Well, you should listen to your
mom.

26:47.995 --> 26:50.698
[Karen]<i> I'm doing that.</i>

26:50.698 --> 26:52.266
<i>- I'm, yeah.
- Okay.</i>

26:52.266 --> 26:55.336
Well, I'd like to see you when
you feel better.

26:55.336 --> 26:58.172
Yeah, I wanna see you and the
girls too.

26:58.172 --> 27:00.875
[Andi]<i> Well, when Lisa thinks
it's best,</i>

27:00.875 --> 27:03.044
<i>then, we'll all come over.</i>

27:03.044 --> 27:04.979
Okay.
Oh, oh, she's coming.

27:04.979 --> 27:06.747
Let me call you back.
Okay, bye, bye-bye.

27:13.788 --> 27:17.992
[phone ringing]

27:17.992 --> 27:19.727
[Danni]<i> You find out anything?</i>

27:19.727 --> 27:23.130
No, um, he's still in a meeting.

27:23.130 --> 27:25.499
Damn it, Andi.
Go in there.

27:25.499 --> 27:27.568
[Andi]<i> Uh, I'm not gonna go in
that meeting.</i>

27:27.568 --> 27:29.870
<i>It's a shareholders meeting.
That's not why I called you.</i>

27:29.870 --> 27:31.839
Okay, do not call Karen.

27:31.839 --> 27:34.308
[Danni]<i> Why did you say that out
of the clear blue sky?</i>

27:34.308 --> 27:36.477
Because her doctor put her on
bedrest.

27:36.477 --> 27:38.846
Shit, okay, alright.
Is she okay?

27:38.846 --> 27:40.347
She says she is.

27:40.347 --> 27:43.250
Lisa has her locked up in that
bed with her feet up.

27:43.250 --> 27:44.752
Okay, that makes sense.

27:44.752 --> 27:46.420
So, you're saying,

27:46.420 --> 27:49.457
call her, check on her but don't
mention Sabrina.

27:49.457 --> 27:51.058
Is that, is that what you mean?

27:51.058 --> 27:52.793
Is that what you was trying to
say?

27:52.793 --> 27:54.395
Exactly.
Now, I have to go.

27:54.395 --> 27:55.863
I'll talk to you later okay?

27:55.863 --> 27:57.465
Okay, Andi.

27:57.465 --> 28:00.968
You know, don't think I've
forgotten

28:00.968 --> 28:04.872
about Long Dong Gary, who's
clearly,

28:04.872 --> 28:07.041
reached so far up into your
body,

28:07.041 --> 28:09.310
that he's -- all over your
brain

28:09.310 --> 28:11.412
and you can't talk straight.

28:11.412 --> 28:13.447
Okay?
We're gonna talk about that.

28:13.447 --> 28:15.049
We will not talk about that.

28:15.049 --> 28:16.383
[Danni]<i> Alright, but this
Sabrina shit...</i>

28:16.383 --> 28:17.818
- Okay, bye.
- [Danni]<i> ...is priority.</i>

28:17.818 --> 28:19.320
I got it!

28:19.320 --> 28:20.755
- Bye.
- [Danni]<i> Okay.</i>

28:32.105 --> 28:34.273
Here's your lunch.

28:34.273 --> 28:36.876
Momma, I'm not helpless.

28:36.876 --> 28:39.445
No, but the doctor said for you
to rest.

28:39.445 --> 28:42.048
Okay, but gonna be on me like...

28:42.048 --> 28:44.317
White on rice.

28:44.317 --> 28:46.052
This is gonna drive me crazy.

28:46.052 --> 28:47.420
Oh, honey.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.088
It hasn't been a whole day yet.

28:49.088 --> 28:50.423
I know.

28:50.423 --> 28:53.860
So, rest.

28:53.860 --> 28:58.765
- Okay.
- And I heard you on the phone.

28:58.765 --> 29:00.666
I was talking to Andi.

29:00.666 --> 29:03.102
Mmhmm, how is she doing?

29:03.102 --> 29:04.570
She's good.

29:04.570 --> 29:06.739
She wants to come over.

29:06.739 --> 29:10.009
Well, she can.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.944
Can she?

29:11.944 --> 29:13.579
Tomorrow.

29:13.579 --> 29:16.315
Momma, I am not a child, okay?

29:16.315 --> 29:20.319
No, baby, but you're my child.

29:20.319 --> 29:22.889
Okay.

29:22.889 --> 29:25.258
And, uh, how are the letters
coming?

29:27.693 --> 29:29.595
Harder than I thought.

29:29.595 --> 29:33.099
Yeah, I kinda figured they would
be.

29:33.099 --> 29:37.270
[sighs] Every time I start I
just,

29:37.270 --> 29:40.306
I start tearing up again.

29:40.306 --> 29:46.179
Well, the good news is you're on
the right path.

29:46.179 --> 29:48.781
Yeah, but Momma, I'm tired of
crying.

29:48.781 --> 29:51.317
Yeah, but the good thing about
crying

29:51.317 --> 29:53.986
is that it leads to healing.

29:53.986 --> 29:56.355
Where'd you learn all this?

29:56.355 --> 30:00.059
- Oprah.
- Oh, I shoulda known.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.261
Don't sleep.
Don't be jacking on Oprah.

30:02.261 --> 30:03.763
I'm not.

30:03.763 --> 30:06.632
Baby, Oprah was our classroom in
the day.

30:06.632 --> 30:08.634
I know.

30:08.634 --> 30:11.204
Unlike, that slimy ass classroom

30:11.204 --> 30:14.407
that you guys have to deal with
nowadays.

30:14.407 --> 30:15.775
What do you mean?

30:15.775 --> 30:20.012
Oh, baby, mm, you guys,

30:20.012 --> 30:24.517
you guys are stuck on the social
media bullshit train.

30:24.517 --> 30:27.253
Well, I don't post much.

30:27.253 --> 30:28.554
- Good.
- So, yeah.

30:28.554 --> 30:29.989
Keep it that way.

30:29.989 --> 30:32.024
Okay, well, do I have a choice?
'Cause my phone...

30:32.024 --> 30:36.128
Well, right now, no you don't
have much of a choice.

30:36.128 --> 30:37.430
Okay.

30:37.430 --> 30:40.766
But what you do need to do is
get on those letters.

30:40.766 --> 30:43.069
Why, did you call 'em?

30:43.069 --> 30:44.804
Yep.

30:44.804 --> 30:48.441
- What? They coming?
- Yep, yep, yep.

30:48.441 --> 30:50.843
Aaron, Zac, they're both coming.

30:50.843 --> 30:53.613
Oh, and I told Zac to bring his
girlfriend.

30:53.613 --> 30:56.115
Momma, what?

30:56.115 --> 30:57.617
What?

30:57.617 --> 30:59.952
You can't just be inviting her
to my house.

30:59.952 --> 31:01.354
You trying to stress me out?

31:01.354 --> 31:03.422
No, baby, I'm not trying to
stress you out.

31:03.422 --> 31:05.758
I'm trying to get to the bottom
of all this shit.

31:05.758 --> 31:07.126
Momma, she, please.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.262
She what?
What? I'm gonna be here.

31:09.262 --> 31:11.631
What can she possibly do?

31:11.631 --> 31:14.600
I cussed her out.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.435
Yeah, Zac told me about that.

31:16.435 --> 31:17.937
Why?

31:17.937 --> 31:22.408
Well, this time, 'cause I
thought that she told Aaron

31:22.408 --> 31:25.177
I was at the hospital.

31:25.177 --> 31:26.579
Did she?

31:26.579 --> 31:28.080
No, she didn't.

31:28.080 --> 31:33.252
And even if she did, what
difference does it make?

31:33.252 --> 31:35.221
Momma, I just want to be mad at
her.

31:35.221 --> 31:38.891
Okay? I'm mad at him.
She a cool chick, whatever.

31:38.891 --> 31:42.695
If you got something to say to
her, say it now.

31:42.695 --> 31:44.497
Or forever hold my piece.

31:44.497 --> 31:46.566
Exactly.

31:46.566 --> 31:49.135
So, you ready?

31:49.135 --> 31:50.570
Eat.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.104
Write.

31:52.104 --> 31:55.474
And let me know when you're
done.

31:55.474 --> 31:59.145
They'll be here at 8 o'clock.

31:59.145 --> 32:02.748
So, I'm gonna go work in the
kitchen.

32:02.748 --> 32:05.718
- Okay.
- Love you, mean it.

32:05.718 --> 32:07.253
Thanks.

32:07.253 --> 32:08.688
Love you back.

32:08.688 --> 32:10.923
Aggressive.

32:10.923 --> 32:13.426
All of this is aggressive.

32:25.738 --> 32:29.475
[phone vibrating]

32:29.475 --> 32:30.910
[sighs]

32:33.145 --> 32:34.714
Yes.

32:34.714 --> 32:36.916
[Zac]<i> Can I talk to you?</i>

32:36.916 --> 32:38.317
Zac, I'm at work.

32:38.317 --> 32:41.754
[Zac]<i> I know.
I'm in the reception area.</i>

32:41.754 --> 32:43.389
What?
What are you doing?

32:43.389 --> 32:44.757
The partners are here.

32:44.757 --> 32:46.759
[Zac]<i> Look, I'm sick, okay?</i>

32:46.759 --> 32:48.995
<i>I have to talk to you.</i>

32:48.995 --> 32:51.864
Alright, I'm on my way up the
break room.

32:51.864 --> 32:54.500
[Zac]<i> Yes.</i>

32:54.500 --> 32:55.935
[sighs] This boy.

33:10.950 --> 33:13.552
- Come on, don't be like that.
- Stop Zac, I'm at work.

33:13.552 --> 33:16.656
Come on, man, let me kiss you.

33:16.656 --> 33:18.557
- Stop!
- Come on, man.

33:18.557 --> 33:20.860
Fine, fine.
You mad, I get it.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.828
Okay, but I thought about what
you said.

33:22.828 --> 33:25.131
I can't think of a way to prove
to you

33:25.131 --> 33:26.966
that I'm not in love with her.

33:29.568 --> 33:32.371
I just.
No, just listen to me.

33:32.371 --> 33:34.206
Look at me.

33:34.206 --> 33:37.043
Can you look at me, please?

33:37.043 --> 33:39.545
I know there's a lot of
emotional baggage

33:39.545 --> 33:40.946
there with her.

33:40.946 --> 33:42.682
And I get it.

33:42.682 --> 33:45.551
But I don't want to be with her.

33:45.551 --> 33:47.787
I want to be with you.

33:47.787 --> 33:49.922
You not gonna hold my hand?

33:49.922 --> 33:53.125
- Come on.
- Okay.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.927
Don't okay me, believe me.

33:57.229 --> 33:59.298
Fatima, I will flip, I will
cause a scene.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.866
Alright, alright, Zac, I
believe you.

34:00.866 --> 34:02.635
Okay, I believe you.

34:02.635 --> 34:04.737
Good.

34:04.737 --> 34:07.873
With that said, [sighs]

34:07.873 --> 34:09.842
her mom wants me to come talk to
her.

34:11.844 --> 34:13.546
Zac, mm-mm.

34:13.546 --> 34:17.450
She, wait, wait, she also asked
if Aaron can come talk to her.

34:19.685 --> 34:22.388
- I think it's a good idea.
- Why?

34:22.388 --> 34:25.157
Listen, she, she wants us to
talk to Karen.

34:25.157 --> 34:27.293
This is a good thing, trust me.

34:27.293 --> 34:29.595
Why?

34:29.595 --> 34:32.264
Her mom is cool peoples.

34:32.264 --> 34:35.167
She is, and she listens to her
mom.

34:35.167 --> 34:38.237
If anybody gonna set her
straight, it's her.

34:38.237 --> 34:39.472
Okay?

34:43.042 --> 34:45.010
So, you going over there?

34:45.010 --> 34:47.246
She also invited you.

34:47.246 --> 34:50.783
- [laughs] Yeah, not happening.
- I told her that.

34:50.783 --> 34:53.586
Yeah, 'cause I'm not gonna be
another bitch without a fight.

34:53.586 --> 34:55.087
I know, I know.

34:55.087 --> 34:57.323
Can you calm down?

34:57.323 --> 34:59.091
You 'bout to bust out this
dress.

34:59.091 --> 35:01.360
This dress dressin' right now.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.129
I see a little smirk there.
Come on.

35:03.129 --> 35:05.231
- Shut up.
- Uh-huh.

35:05.231 --> 35:06.665
Come on.

35:06.665 --> 35:08.801
So, you going over there?

35:08.801 --> 35:10.336
Only if you say it's okay.

35:13.839 --> 35:15.508
Whatever, yeah.

35:15.508 --> 35:16.876
Don't do that.

35:16.876 --> 35:18.410
Don't, don't do that.

35:18.410 --> 35:21.881
Zac, you need to handle this
shit.

35:21.881 --> 35:23.783
I thought I did.

35:23.783 --> 35:27.219
I know you thought you did.

35:27.219 --> 35:30.623
Can you just not be mad at me?

35:30.623 --> 35:32.792
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

35:32.792 --> 35:36.428
I know anything I said that made
you feel uncomfortable

35:36.428 --> 35:38.898
and brought up the dude that
made you this mad,

35:38.898 --> 35:41.801
that's my fault, I'm sorry.

35:41.801 --> 35:44.537
Come on, Baby.

35:44.537 --> 35:46.906
Well, you did.

35:46.906 --> 35:48.240
I hate seeing you this mad.

35:50.342 --> 35:51.844
Well, I'm working on that.

35:51.844 --> 35:53.412
- I am.
- I get it.

35:53.412 --> 35:54.880
I get it.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.550
Babe, this is, it's just
triggering for me.

35:57.550 --> 35:58.984
I, I know.

35:58.984 --> 36:01.821
That's why you need to let me go
over there this one last time.

36:01.821 --> 36:03.756
I got you.
I'm set it straight.

36:03.756 --> 36:05.090
Imma shut all this shit down.

36:05.090 --> 36:07.126
I'm not playing.

36:07.126 --> 36:08.828
Zac, this better be the last
time.

36:08.828 --> 36:11.297
I, look at me.

36:11.297 --> 36:13.632
It's the, the last time, I
promise you.

36:16.569 --> 36:17.937
Okay.

36:17.937 --> 36:19.538
Alright?

36:19.538 --> 36:22.074
Can I get a smile?

36:22.074 --> 36:25.544
That smile was fake as hell.

36:25.544 --> 36:30.916
Alright, well, my plan is to go
over there at 8:30,

36:30.916 --> 36:32.685
and set it straight.
What you gonna do?

36:32.685 --> 36:35.654
You gonna be waiting for me in
this dress?

36:35.654 --> 36:37.122
When I come home?

36:37.122 --> 36:40.526
No, I was thinking about calling
my girls and my cousin

36:40.526 --> 36:42.428
to come over.

36:42.428 --> 36:44.864
Oh, so I'm gonna have a bunch of
gangstas in the house

36:44.864 --> 36:46.298
when I get home?

36:46.298 --> 36:47.967
You just need to go handle that.

36:47.967 --> 36:50.603
Alright, I got you.

36:50.603 --> 36:53.806
Alright, I gotta get back to
work.

36:53.806 --> 36:55.174
I love you.

36:55.174 --> 36:56.609
I love you too.

36:56.609 --> 36:59.278
Excuse me, I can't hear you, I
was, it's loud.

36:59.278 --> 37:01.580
I said I love you.

37:01.580 --> 37:03.515
I love you too, Zac.

37:03.515 --> 37:04.917
Can I have a kiss?

37:04.917 --> 37:06.185
- No.
- Can I have a kiss?

37:06.185 --> 37:08.053
No?
Can I touch you?

37:08.053 --> 37:10.456
- No.
- I, I'm about to go see her.

37:10.456 --> 37:12.892
You know what, you might, yeah,
you might need to go ahead.

37:12.892 --> 37:16.061
- Before I see Karen.
- Yeah go ahead and do that.

37:16.061 --> 37:17.763
- I love you baby.
- So, you don't forget.

37:17.763 --> 37:22.334
- And I only love you like this.
- I love you too.

37:22.334 --> 37:25.204
- Ugh.
- Bruh, why are you here?

37:25.204 --> 37:27.072
Dude, it's a free country.

37:27.072 --> 37:28.641
He know I got a restraining
order, right?

37:28.641 --> 37:30.476
[Zac]<i> He know I don't care,
right?</i>

37:30.476 --> 37:31.710
Okay.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.913
And you might want to check that
and be sure.

37:33.913 --> 37:35.848
- What you mean?
- You heard me.

37:35.848 --> 37:38.050
Or are you hard of hearing?

37:41.086 --> 37:42.588
It's like that, huh?

37:42.588 --> 37:44.189
It's like that.

37:44.189 --> 37:45.824
Come on, baby.

37:45.824 --> 37:47.293
Let's go.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.430
- Imma remember this shit.
- Remember it.

37:53.167 --> 37:54.535
<i>♪ Got big plans up in a party
and I do my dance ♪</i>

37:54.535 --> 37:56.404
<i>♪ Shake my little booty and I
wave my hands ♪</i>

37:56.404 --> 37:58.573
<i>♪ Pull up on a cutie, oh, was
that your man ♪</i>

37:58.573 --> 38:00.208
<i>♪ That's yo' man, okay, my bad ♪</i>

38:00.208 --> 38:02.176
<i>♪ Imma turn it up, let it rain

38:02.176 --> 38:05.113
<i>♪ Yeah, it's getting hot, got
the flame like this ♪</i>

38:05.113 --> 38:07.248
Hey.

38:07.248 --> 38:09.050
So, I have a restraining order
against Zac,

38:09.050 --> 38:12.220
but I don't understand what's
happening.

38:12.220 --> 38:14.789
You need to talk to Robin.

38:14.789 --> 38:16.591
He can't get rid of my
restraining order.

38:16.591 --> 38:19.627
Maybe you should reread the
contract you signed

38:19.627 --> 38:21.195
to work here.

38:21.195 --> 38:23.798
What are you talking about?

38:23.798 --> 38:26.901
Paragraph 45 page 9 says,

38:26.901 --> 38:29.470
"When it comes to intercompany
security,

38:29.470 --> 38:33.641
you can't prevent a client from
coming into the office."

38:33.641 --> 38:35.643
He's not a client.

38:35.643 --> 38:37.979
Did you forget?
I represent him.

38:37.979 --> 38:40.281
He's my client.

38:40.281 --> 38:43.451
You think this shit is cute,
huh?

38:43.451 --> 38:45.753
Maybe a little bit.

38:45.753 --> 38:50.458
Well, I'm real excited for you
to see this next big moment.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.428
Oh, a big moment.

38:53.428 --> 38:55.129
As a matter of fact,

38:55.129 --> 38:58.866
I think it's happening right
now.

38:58.866 --> 39:01.169
What?

39:01.169 --> 39:05.039
You don't see who he's meeting
with?

39:05.039 --> 39:06.641
Hayden, why are you talking to
me?

39:06.641 --> 39:08.075
What do you want?

39:08.075 --> 39:10.211
You don't see who's in his
office right now?

39:10.211 --> 39:13.714
I don't care who's in his office
right now.

39:13.714 --> 39:19.487
You know, I can only imagine
what they are saying about you.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.556
You need to leave.

39:21.556 --> 39:22.890
Okay.

39:22.890 --> 39:24.358
If you say so.

39:24.358 --> 39:27.128
You know what, I never wish ill
on anyone.

39:27.128 --> 39:29.197
I do, all the time.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.002
Yeah, okay.

39:35.002 --> 39:36.337
This is beneath me.

39:38.339 --> 39:42.310
And you didn't come to my rescue
did you?

39:42.310 --> 39:44.846
- Your rescue?
- Yeah, my rescue.

39:44.846 --> 39:47.849
You know he was threatening me.

39:47.849 --> 39:50.985
[laughs] Okay Hayden, what's
your deal?

39:50.985 --> 39:52.520
Let's talk.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.089
Do you need therapy?

39:55.089 --> 39:57.024
Did someone steal your bike as a
child?

39:57.024 --> 39:58.559
Were you bullied?

39:58.559 --> 40:00.461
Ain't nobody get bullied.

40:00.461 --> 40:03.631
Because all of this is immature
and stupid.

40:03.631 --> 40:05.666
Stupid?

40:05.666 --> 40:07.635
Hayden, you're a grown ass man.

40:07.635 --> 40:08.936
This is a law firm.

40:08.936 --> 40:10.805
It's not a daycare.

40:10.805 --> 40:12.773
You right, it is a law firm.

40:12.773 --> 40:15.276
Where lawyers meet.

40:15.276 --> 40:20.348
- What?
- And where he meets with him.

40:20.348 --> 40:22.517
What are you talking about?

40:22.517 --> 40:27.154
Why don't you go in there and
see who he's talking to?

40:27.154 --> 40:29.957
And for how long they been
talking?

40:31.926 --> 40:33.361
[clears throat]

40:33.361 --> 40:37.665
Hayden, I'm gonna ask you one
more time, nicely,

40:37.665 --> 40:39.700
to leave my office.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.135
You got it, Andi.

40:47.441 --> 40:49.577
- Excuse me.
- Get yo' ass out of here.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.081
Go!

40:57.485 --> 40:59.987
He is annoying.

40:59.987 --> 41:03.291
I know, right?

41:03.291 --> 41:07.295
But uh, Andi, we got bigger
problems.

41:07.295 --> 41:08.529
What?

41:08.529 --> 41:11.232
Gary and Robin are in his office
talking right now.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.902
Something really bad is gonna
happen to you.

41:20.902 --> 41:22.471
Are you threatening me right
now, Andi?

41:22.471 --> 41:24.139
It's a promise, Hayden.

41:24.139 --> 41:26.441
- [Fatima]<i> Next on Sistas.
- So, I'm about to get off work.</i>

41:26.441 --> 41:27.776
Where do you wanna meet?

41:27.776 --> 41:29.544
Depends on how deep your pockets
are.

41:29.544 --> 41:31.146
I love her and she loves me.

41:31.146 --> 41:32.881
I don't see a ring on her
finger.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.483
It'll be back on soon.

41:34.483 --> 41:36.451
- You high?
- They drug test?

41:36.451 --> 41:38.420
- Mmhmm.
- Oh well.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.755
You not gonna make it.

41:39.755 --> 41:41.957
- Sabrina's in jail.
- What?

41:41.957 --> 41:44.526
And I can't get any help from
anybody.

41:44.526 --> 41:47.000

you out. She knows everybody.
