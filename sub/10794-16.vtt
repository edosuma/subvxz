WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:05.406
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.439 --> 00:09.177
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.046
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.080 --> 00:13.714
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.747 --> 00:17.185
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.054
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.823
You are a good commander.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.226
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.095
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:27.128 --> 00:28.696
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.999
That is the mission.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.835
SCOTT: And this is Varro,
 one of our remaining
 Alliance guests.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.104
I haven't seen
you in a while.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.238
Your kidneys
 are failing.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.039
End-stage
 renal disease.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.809
The only other
 option for treatment
 would be a transplant.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.845
He won't reject it.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.880
Great, no pressure.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.282
JOHANSEN: There might
 be a little infection
 setting in there.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.784
I'm fine.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.121
Eli, what the hell
 did you do?
 Goodbye.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.257
I transferred
 the memory where they were
 stored into quarantine.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.726
They're cut off
 from the rest of
 the ship now, and us.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.329
That's what I did.
 To save you.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.766
SCOTT: Wow. Space deer.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.301
PARK: They're beautiful.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.470
GREER: They're going
 to look even more beautiful

01:09.503 --> 01:13.974
slow-roasted and served up
 with a side of Becker's mash.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.743
You're not
 serious.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.311
Uh...

01:17.345 --> 01:19.380
And how exactly
 would you cook 'em?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.481
I wouldn't.
 I'm a vegetarian.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.483
No.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.885
For the past 10 months,
 we have all been vegetarian.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.020
I am dying
 for a steak.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.990
I could use
 a steak.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.059
No, you guys can't
 kill those creatures,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.094
and this has nothing
 to do with being
 a vegetarian.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.062
I mean, we don't
 know anything
 about them.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.797
They could be
 intelligent.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.833
We just saw one of
them eat its own vomit.
How smart can they be?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.903
Guys! I could use
 some help over here.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.838
Okay, look,
 I'll tell you what,

01:44.872 --> 01:47.241
if they can give
 me one good reason

01:47.275 --> 01:50.144
why I shouldn't
 eat them, I won't,

01:50.178 --> 01:53.847
but it better be a good one,
 because I am mighty hungry.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.483
Lieutenant?
SCOTT: Let's do it.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.020
Not cool.

02:16.904 --> 02:17.971
Want me to take it?

02:18.005 --> 02:18.972
No. No.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.909
I got it.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.882
Damn!
 What the heck happened?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.286
Something must've
 spooked them.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.422
We've got plenty of time.
Want to go after 'em?

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
Hell, yeah.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.427
(CREATURE SNARLING)

02:41.562 --> 02:43.397
What was that?
 Hang on.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.938
(BEEPING)

02:57.578 --> 02:58.946
(GRUNTING)

03:00.581 --> 03:02.383
SCOTT: Shoot! Shoot it!

03:23.371 --> 03:24.305
SCOTT: Shoot it!

03:25.539 --> 03:26.907
(CREATURE GROWLING)

03:30.378 --> 03:32.179
It's heading for the camp!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.047
By the time
 we got there,
 it was gone.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.116
Was anybody hurt?

03:36.149 --> 03:40.388
No fatalities,
but plenty of injuries,
and two missing.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.990
Reynolds and T.J.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.127
Permission to go
 after them, sir.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.396
Permission denied.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.398
Sir, I know things
may look bad, but there
is still a chance

03:50.431 --> 03:52.266
that T.J. and Reynolds
 could be alive down there.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.035
Which is why we
 need to find them
 as fast as possible.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.870
I'm going to need
 you here, Lieutenant.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.440
While I'm gone, you're
 in charge. You got
 a problem with that?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.975
(SIGHS) No, sir.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.490
Hey! What are you doing?

04:16.524 --> 04:19.226
Checking to see
what's inside.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.093
Why, what does it
 look like I'm doing?

04:20.661 --> 04:23.063
Come on.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.498
ELI: I thought
the whole point
of exploring

04:24.532 --> 04:26.166
unexplored
 sections of the ship

04:26.199 --> 04:29.069
was to, well,
 explore them.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.405
We are.
 Yeah? Not really.

04:31.439 --> 04:35.008
Well, what can I say?
 Rush wants us to take
 a cautious approach.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.944
Who cares
 what Rush thinks?
 He's not our boss.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.512
(SCOFFS)
 You tell him that.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.013
I will.
No, you won't.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.248
I am not
 afraid of him.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.116
Afraid of whom?

04:43.150 --> 04:45.553
"Who." I think
it's "who."

04:46.354 --> 04:47.521
"Afraid of who."

04:47.555 --> 04:48.889
Afraid not.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.927
Hey, what've we got here?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.196
This is one of the last
 rooms in this section.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.633
I'm guessing more
 Ancient containers.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.547
I want to see them rescued
 as much as anyone,

05:13.581 --> 05:16.717
but we have to consider
 the possibility that they
 may already be dead.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.554
We swept the area.
 If they were dead, why
 didn't we find the bodies?

05:20.588 --> 05:23.056
Maybe the creature
 dragged them away,

05:23.090 --> 05:24.425
took them somewhere
 it wouldn't be disturbed.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.197
Neither of them
 are responding to
 radio communications.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.065
Maybe they're
 unconscious,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.234
or their radios
 were lost or damaged,
 I don't know.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.070
All I'm saying is we
 can hope for the best

05:37.104 --> 05:39.172
as long as we're
 prepared for the worst.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.108
You're right.
 Why don't you guys
 meet us at the gate?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.586
You mind telling me
 what happened back
 there on the planet?

05:52.620 --> 05:55.288
You had the shot,
you didn't take it.
Why not?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.991
I don't know.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.427
If it's a moment
 of indecision

05:59.460 --> 06:02.362
just one of those things,
 then you can drop it,

06:02.396 --> 06:05.999
but if there is a
problem, you need
to find out what it is,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.701
and you need
 to fix it. Fast.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.470
Yes, sir.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.643
Stasis pods?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.579
Yeah.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.582
Obviously
 designed for lengthy
 intergalactic journeys.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.518
We've got multiple rooms
 exactly like this one,
 going both ways.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.454
It's fascinating.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.388
That's a bit of
 an understatement.
 This is huge.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.292
Agreed.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.295
Okay, let's leave it
 for now. Let's go.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.531
What? You can't
 be serious.

06:37.565 --> 06:41.234
Well, given recent
 events, it may be wise

06:41.268 --> 06:44.337
to check over the ship's
 data on this compartment
 before proceeding.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.787
Sergeant, hold up.
 I think we lost its trail.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.589
We should double back.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.390
Well, we need to
 keep moving forward.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.592
Well, not if we're
 headed the wrong way.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.295
Back the way we
 came is the wrong way.

07:08.328 --> 07:13.300
We keep moving forward,
 we'll pick up the trail
 again. Trust me.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.502
All right, you guys
check out the area,

07:14.535 --> 07:15.469
see if you can
 spot any tracks.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.707
Sergeant.
 What's up?

07:21.374 --> 07:22.743
GREER: We're up against
 the clock here, sir.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.412
Which is why we can't afford
 to make any more mistakes.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.681
Listen to me,
 I know this is
 tearing you apart,

07:27.715 --> 07:29.583
but what's
 done is done.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.451
And you let guilt
 start dictating
 your actions,

07:31.485 --> 07:33.621
you're just
 asking for trouble.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.188
I don't know, maybe
 you needed more time to
 recuperate after surgery.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.159
I'm fine, sir.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.694
Then get your
 head on straight.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.732
James, Marsden...

08:10.691 --> 08:13.226
Any updates
 from the planet?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.730
They've lost the trail,
 so they're doubling back.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.236
I'd like to volunteer
 to help with this rescue op.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.173
Well, much appreciated,
but Colonel Young
and his team

08:26.206 --> 08:28.308
are more than capable
of seeing this through.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.644
With all due respect,
 no, they're not.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.547
They have
 the training, but they lack
 the necessary experience.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.249
Me and my people
 have been hunting
 most of our lives.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.351
We can track
 this animal for you.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.386
We can do it better,
 faster than anyone

08:40.419 --> 08:42.556
you've got down there
 on the ground right now.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.596
When this is over,
 you're gonna wanna know

08:48.629 --> 08:51.264
that you did everything
 in your power to save them.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.466
Right?

08:57.771 --> 09:00.440
Well, it happened
 so fast.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.744
One minute I was helping
 to catalog plant samples,

09:03.777 --> 09:06.680
and the next I was on
 the ground and everyone
 was screaming.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.916
Hey. I just heard.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.518
Come to check up
on us, huh?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.354
Yeah.
 Yeah, I came to
 check up on you both.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.522
How are you?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.224
In constant pain.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.593
I think my ankle's broken.
 Every time I move...

09:19.627 --> 09:20.928
Well, hang in there.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.462
How about you?

09:22.495 --> 09:24.865
According to
 the medical scan,
 a cracked rib.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.768
Ha! I should be
 so lucky.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.569
How do you... How do you
 treat a cracked rib?

09:29.603 --> 09:32.405
You don't. Speaking
 from personal experience,

09:32.439 --> 09:34.608
snowboarding accident,

09:34.642 --> 09:37.645
you just take it easy.
 It'll heal itself
 in about a month.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.413
In a month?

09:40.447 --> 09:43.316
Okay. Is there anything
 you need? Anything I can do?

09:43.350 --> 09:44.885
Yeah, could you
 take off my sock?

09:44.918 --> 09:45.986
Are you serious, dude?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.387
My foot's swelling up!

09:47.420 --> 09:48.455
I'll get that
 for you.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.826
Thanks for coming by.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.461
Yeah, it was nothing.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.997
Rush had me
 up on the bridge
 running diagnostics.

09:57.030 --> 09:57.965
I really appreciate it.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.805
Yeah, no, I just
wanted to make sure
you were all right.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.486
(RUSTLING)

10:20.520 --> 10:21.554
REYNOLDS: Lieutenant?

10:22.522 --> 10:23.323
Lieutenant!

10:26.559 --> 10:27.728
Oh, thank God.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.531
(GROANS)

10:32.399 --> 10:33.400
(EXCLAIMS)

10:35.803 --> 10:37.537
Where are we?
 I don't know.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.873
How did we get here?

10:39.907 --> 10:42.375
The thing that
 attacked the camp,
 it took us here.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.377
We must've lost our
 sidearms in the commotion.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.713
Your radio, too.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.415
Here, I've got mine,
 but it's damaged.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.759
We have to get out of here.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.764
I can't put any weight
 on my leg. I think
 it might be broken.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.969
(EXCLAIMING)

11:09.002 --> 11:10.771
It could just be
a fracture. Hang tight.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.977
If this thing
 wanted to kill us,
 we'd be dead already.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.779
So I figure that's
 a good thing, right?
 It wants us alive.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.018
It's saving us.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.755
Saving us?
 From what?

11:28.789 --> 11:29.790
Not from anything.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.627
It's saving us for later.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.867
I don't like it.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.701
Yeah, well, you don't
 have to like it,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.470
just pretend you do,
 at least until we
 get our people back.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.038
Here they come.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.944
It's about time.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.446
We just wanted to
 check out the campsite.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.882
We appreciate
 your help.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.616
Don't mention it.

11:56.649 --> 11:57.985
We're all in this
 together, right?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.858
The fact that there's
 no significant blood

12:04.892 --> 12:06.393
at the campsite
 is a good sign.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.995
It suggests the creature
 wanted them alive.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.563
Why?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.432
Probably likes
 its meat fresh.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.902
Which means we've
 got to move quickly.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.070
The sooner
 we locate them,
 the better,

12:17.104 --> 12:19.472
because this rescue op
 has the potential

12:19.506 --> 12:21.741
to turn into a recovery
 mission real fast.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.544
Looks like it's
 going to get dark soon.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578
Here!

12:31.785 --> 12:35.923
Partial print there
 and there, heading off
 in that direction.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.667
You know, we finally
 unseal a new section,

12:47.700 --> 12:50.637
make the biggest discovery
 aboard this ship
 since the bridge,

12:50.670 --> 12:53.006
and now we're
 supposed to ignore it
 because Rush says so?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.842
Man wants to be cautious.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.910
Since when is
 Rush cautious?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.511
Well, I guess having
 your consciousness

12:58.545 --> 12:59.813
trapped in a simulation
will do that to you.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.984
Screw this.
 Where you going?

13:04.017 --> 13:07.888
To check out the
 stasis pods. And don't
 tell on me, all right?

13:09.722 --> 13:10.958
Wait for me.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.694
Wait, wait, wait.
 Where are you going?

13:14.727 --> 13:15.728
Relax, Corporal.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.842
How does it look?

13:28.876 --> 13:29.742
Not good.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.981
That thing is
still down there.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.851
It's guarding its lair,

13:39.252 --> 13:40.921
and you're in no condition
 to make a run for it.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.623
Look, Lieutenant, please,

13:43.656 --> 13:44.858
I know you'd
 stand a better chance

13:44.892 --> 13:45.658
out there without me,
 but I need...

13:45.692 --> 13:49.462
Listen! I'm not
leaving you behind,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.531
and when the time comes,
 I am going to need your help.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.466
So I need you
 to calm down.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.902
You need to get
 it together, okay?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.036
Can you do that?

13:56.069 --> 13:56.870
Yeah. Yeah.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.539
Okay.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.025
Oh, hey. I'm just on
 my way to the mess.
 Can I get you anything?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.827
No, I'm good,
 thank you.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.662
Hey, how's
 the search going?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.731
I don't know.
 I haven't heard
 anything

14:24.764 --> 14:26.699
since Varro and
 his team went down.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.834
Let us hope that
makes a difference.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.236
Yeah.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.738
It's times like
 these that really

14:31.771 --> 14:34.574
make you appreciate
what you have,

14:34.607 --> 14:35.608
who you have.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.743
Yeah, for sure.

14:37.810 --> 14:38.811
It's like...

14:40.280 --> 14:44.117
Well, having
 Matt has made
 such a difference,

14:44.151 --> 14:47.687
knowing he's there
 for me no matter what.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.157
I'm really lucky to
have that someone.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.161
So does Lisa know?

14:55.162 --> 14:56.496
Know what?

14:57.931 --> 15:00.533
How you feel about her.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.970
I know it's probably
 none of my business,

15:03.003 --> 15:07.140
but I saw
 the way you two
 were together and...

15:07.174 --> 15:10.077
We were?
 No, no, no. Lisa...

15:10.110 --> 15:13.080
Lisa and I, we're just...
 It's strictly...
 (STAMMERS) Professional.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.283
Platonic.
 Professionally platonic.
 We're not...

15:16.316 --> 15:17.917
Oh, I'm sorry.
 I totally misread...

15:17.951 --> 15:19.886
Oh, no, no,
 it's a simple mistake.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.822
(STAMMERING)
 No, no, that happens,
 you know, sometimes.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.963
So you're going
to the mess hall?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.164
Yes. Mmm.
 Yeah.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.332
That's where
 I'm going.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.800
Okay. Thank you.

15:41.341 --> 15:45.345
I'm just saying, recent
 events have made me put
 things in perspective.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.148
Like, who made him
 de facto leader?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.283
He did. He was lead
 scientist on Icarus.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.852
You know, I'm the one
 who solved the mystery
 of the ninth chevron.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.721
Yeah, thanks for that.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.938
So what are you saying?
 You want to be lead scientist?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.008
No. I just...
 I think it's time

16:15.042 --> 16:18.845
that we all had more
 of a say in the decisions
 that are being made.

16:18.878 --> 16:22.282
I'm tired of him
 deciding what's
 best for us.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.051
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
 Whoa! Hold on!

16:24.084 --> 16:25.218
Hey, hey!
 Whoa.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.320
Thanks. Great.
 What did you do?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.721
I didn't do anything.
 What did...

16:28.755 --> 16:29.689
You accidentally
pressed something!

16:29.722 --> 16:30.790
Now, hit the "open" button.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.025
Oh, 'cause there's a...

16:32.059 --> 16:33.726

16:33.760 --> 16:35.062
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

 Oh, that can't...

16:36.863 --> 16:38.365
Hey! Eli!
Okay, hang on, hold on!

16:38.398 --> 16:40.200
Crap! I got it!
 Eli, what're you...

16:40.233 --> 16:42.335
Maybe... Can we...

16:58.951 --> 17:00.987
VARRO: You guys do much
 hunting back on Earth?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.389
YOUNG: Not unless
 you count fishing.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.326
Well, growing up,
 my brother and I,

17:06.358 --> 17:07.960
we learned
 from my father,

17:09.695 --> 17:11.763
how to hunt, kill,

17:11.798 --> 17:14.767
but the most important
 things he taught us was
 respect for the wild.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.771
GREER: There ain't
nothing noble about
this thing. It's a monster.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.907
Yeah, but unlike us,
 animals don't know hate.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.810
All they know is
 fear and hunger.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.016
Hey, I got
something here.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.151
The tracks,

17:32.452 --> 17:33.320
they just stop.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.292
Okay. There's been
 a lot of movement here.

 separate you from the group,

then pick you off!

 do you think happened
 back there?

 it waited for us.

 we've been hunting it,

18:43.055 --> 18:44.824
it's been hunting us.

Why didn't you pull
 that trigger?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.409
gonna react in

But not to you.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.119
Something got inside
 your head. What?

19:49.622 --> 19:50.923
I think I died.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.167
After the kidney surgery,
 during the recovery,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.469
there was a point
 when I woke up

20:04.304 --> 20:05.472
to nothing.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.443
I couldn't hear,
 couldn't see,
 couldn't move.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.614
I was trapped
 in this darkness,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.383
you know, like nothing
 I have ever known.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.986
You were scared.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.290
That's a normal reaction.

20:23.323 --> 20:27.026
I've done some crazy
 things in my day.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.228

 without even giving
 it a second thought.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.330
No fear.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.968
But now,

20:40.507 --> 20:42.409
all I know
 is that darkness

20:46.245 --> 20:49.181
and the fact
 that I don't ever
 want to go back.

20:52.485 --> 20:56.022
T.J. had you under some
pretty heavy sedatives
for that operation.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.159
They shut you down.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.629
Your brain was probably
the first thing to wake up,

21:02.662 --> 21:05.131
and it just took the rest
 of your body a little
 while to catch up.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.967
You think that's
 what it was?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.304
I can't claim
 to know for sure
 what death is,

21:11.338 --> 21:14.607
but I know in my
 heart it isn't that.

 up on my people.

 be on our way.

Here?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.120
This is good.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.255
Good for what?
 Why are we stopping?

23:43.289 --> 23:45.658
We've already established
 this creature is smart.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.461
It sees us as a threat,
 so it's stalking us,

23:48.495 --> 23:51.130

 it's going to try
 to ambush us again,

 till Destiny jumps.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.102

 checking to see if you were...

 which you seemed not to be,

25:12.178 --> 25:14.113
but then now...
 Then you are now.

sitting here,

26:18.410 --> 26:22.414

 putting as much distance
 between us as possible.

knows we're hunting it,

protect its lair.

 it has to make sure
 we never reach it.

 Oh, yeah.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.572
All right.
 We should get moving.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.951
There are more
 of them out there.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.064
Following their
 trail's gotten
 way too easy.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.332
It's almost as if
 they're daring us
 to come after them.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.769
They're luring us
 in to finish us off.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.737
The thing that
 attacked us back
 at the camp

28:24.771 --> 28:27.706
is bigger
than the ones
we're tracking now.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.842
These tracks are smaller.
 These are the babies.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.844
We're getting
 close to their lair.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.913
The fact that we're
 dealing with more than
 one of these things

28:33.946 --> 28:37.616
reduces our chances
 of finding our people alive.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.385
Are you saying
 you're having
 second thoughts?

28:39.418 --> 28:40.853
Because, you know,
 I can do this on my own.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.889
Oh, no, you can't.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.957
Hell, I don't even
 think we can do this
 together,

28:44.991 --> 28:47.059
but I'm gonna
 see this through.

 to the nest,

28:50.930 --> 28:52.664
we're past the point

 too strong.

 the thought of being
 eaten alive.

the guts to do it myself...

 saying, Corporal?

 want to die like that!

 two choices.

 and walk back on the Destiny

29:28.100 --> 29:30.803
with your head
 held high,

29:30.837 --> 29:33.806
or you can force me
 to save your sorry ass,

 I used to run ops with.

30:05.671 --> 30:09.141
First one into
 a firefight, last one
 to leave enemy territory.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.710
He was fearless.

30:11.743 --> 30:15.147
He ended up volunteering
 for what you'd call
 a suicide mission.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.716
He wasn't afraid. Turns out,
 he should've been.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.887
He was wrong.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.055
In those situations,
when the odds
are stacked against you

30:23.089 --> 30:25.624
and you're looking
 death in the face,

30:25.657 --> 30:29.595
it's fear that keeps
 you and the people
 around you alive.

 what's your situation?

Corporal Reynolds
 and I are in a cave

30:47.013 --> 30:49.748
on the side of a hill
 overlooking a ravine.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.751

30:52.784 --> 30:55.021
The creature
that attacked us,
it brought us here,

30:55.054 --> 30:56.722
and it appears to be
 guarding its territory,

30:56.755 --> 30:59.591
so approach with
 extreme caution.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.728
The Corporal is injured
 and in no condition
 to make a run for it.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.898
Hang tight, Lieutenant.
We're coming for you.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.635
Copy.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.907
Sorry. Lost track of time.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.211
Yeah, well,
 I'm not surprised.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.746
You two obviously
 enjoy each other's company.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.017
I'm not sure if you
 meant anything by that,

31:25.051 --> 31:28.054
but you should
 know there's nothing
 going on between me and Park.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.624
Of course not.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.560
What do you mean
 "of course not"?

31:34.593 --> 31:35.794
You say it like it
 could never happen.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.297
Well, it couldn't.

31:38.330 --> 31:42.101
Okay, I get it.
 Because she's so
 attractive and I'm not?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.770
No, no, no, no.

31:44.803 --> 31:49.141
Let's just say that
 you don't seem like
 the romantic type.

31:49.175 --> 31:53.579
Oh, really? Okay.
 Well, then what type am I?

31:53.612 --> 31:54.913
The good friend type,
 obviously.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.084
The trusted confidant.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.019
The guy who's
 always there with the...

32:00.953 --> 32:03.722
The shoulder to cry on.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.591
And that's just life,
 I'm afraid.

32:06.692 --> 32:09.028
We all have our
predestined roles,

32:10.796 --> 32:12.831
but, you know,
on the bright side,

32:12.864 --> 32:15.667
a life free of
romantic entanglements,

32:15.701 --> 32:19.638
well, it certainly benefits
 the pursuit of science.

 I don't have time for this.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.694
I didn't do anything.
 He did this to himself.

32:42.728 --> 32:43.929
He was just in there
 pushing buttons...

32:43.962 --> 32:45.364
Is he okay?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.699
Yes, according to
 the monitoring system,
 he's fine.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.668
Just frozen.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.669
Did you tell Rush?

32:50.702 --> 32:52.004
Oh, no, no, no, no.

32:52.038 --> 32:55.041
And we're not going to.
 Not yet, anyway.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.309
Just for once I'd like
 to solve a problem
 without his help.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.977
Eli, you have to
 get him out of there.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.813
I know, which is
 why you're here.

33:01.847 --> 33:05.217
You still have some
 of that residual alien
 knowledge, right?

33:05.251 --> 33:06.352
Eli...

33:06.385 --> 33:08.320
Just do me a favor.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.822
Take a look.
 See if anything
 jumps out at you?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.161
Um...

33:19.931 --> 33:20.766
That's got to be it.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.218
I'll go first,
 scout out the area.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.019
If it's clear,
 I'll radio back.

 to say, say it.

 you're up for this.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.700
No, you're not a coward,

33:54.733 --> 33:56.768
but you're
 second-guessing yourself,
 and that's a problem.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.270
We don't have time for you

33:58.304 --> 33:59.705
to sort through
 whatever issues
 you're dealing with.

33:59.738 --> 34:00.772

 to create a little
 diversion for me.

 wants to hurt us.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.375
No, the fire.
 It recognizes intelligence.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.377
Didn't stop it from
trying to kill us.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.179
That's because
 you were a threat
 to it and its family.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.948
It recognizes a threat
 and goes after it.

 counting on out there
 to buy us some time

35:53.018 --> 35:57.088
so I suggest that
 you start moving.

 that I can cause
 it a world of hurt,

36:19.611 --> 36:21.413
maybe even kill it,

 that I'm choosing

not to.
