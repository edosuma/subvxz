00:03.283 --> 00:11.590
Male narrator: In the frozen north...
Where few can survive...

00:11.592 --> 00:17.529
Lives a special breed...
That thrives on thin ice.

00:17.531 --> 00:20.432
[Laughs]

00:20.434 --> 00:24.436
You go through the ice out
here, you're fucking dead.

00:24.438 --> 00:28.540
Narrator: This season...
Watch yourself.

00:28.542 --> 00:32.578
Narrator: Three roads
caught at polar extremes.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.046
Whoa!

00:34.048 --> 00:38.517
These are the years that
kill truck drivers.

00:38.519 --> 00:41.620
Narrator: Crossing rivers,
lakes, and oceans.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.889
[Laughs]

00:43.891 --> 00:48.660
The drivers that started
it all face new blood.

00:48.662 --> 00:50.562
Fuck you, Jack!

00:50.564 --> 00:52.931
I will skin your fucking
ass, motherfucker.

00:52.933 --> 00:55.100
I feel like a total badass.

00:55.102 --> 00:56.201
Oh, fuck.

00:56.203 --> 00:57.202
[Horn honks]

00:57.204 --> 01:03.542
Narrator: And only the best...
Will survive the season.

01:03.544 --> 01:06.578
That'll get your blood pumping.

01:06.580 --> 01:10.035
This is a fucking dangerous,
dangerous fucking job.

Narrator: In the most remote
reaches of northern Canada,

01:51.658 --> 01:55.360
there's only one lifeline
for those in need.

01:55.362 --> 01:58.396
[Horn honks]

01:58.398 --> 02:03.902
The 500-mile Dempster highway.

02:03.904 --> 02:11.042
Carved through wild stretches of the
Yukon and Northwest territories...

02:11.044 --> 02:12.310
[Horn honking]

02:12.312 --> 02:18.049
Crossing over two of Canada's
fastest flowing rivers...

02:18.051 --> 02:26.625
And stretching out over the
vast Arctic ocean, an ice road

02:26.627 --> 02:29.628
to the top of the world.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.030
[Horn blares]

02:32.032 --> 02:36.668
In Whitehorse, Yukon,
Manitoulin Transport has one

02:36.670 --> 02:46.211
mission, ensure Canada's northern
community survive another arctic winter.

02:46.213 --> 02:50.649
And this year, they're betting
on a titan of the ice.

02:50.651 --> 02:51.850
More bears than people.

02:51.852 --> 02:53.051
Just the way I like it.

02:53.053 --> 02:56.221
[Laugh heartily]

02:56.223 --> 03:00.792
Narrator: A lifelong native of
the north, Alex Debogorski's

03:00.794 --> 03:03.428
mission hits home.

03:03.430 --> 03:04.963
Well, here we are.

03:04.965 --> 03:10.135
As a driver, my job is to fulfill
this part of the world's

03:10.137 --> 03:12.404
needs, whether we bring 'em
their medicines or whether we

03:12.406 --> 03:16.975
bring 'em their freight or
we bring 'em their parts.

03:16.977 --> 03:20.979
Narrator: Alex has survived nearly
every ice road in North America.

03:20.981 --> 03:22.247
Whoa!

03:22.249 --> 03:23.948
Easy.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.216
I'm gonna need good luck.

03:25.218 --> 03:27.719
[Laughs]

03:27.721 --> 03:31.523
Narrator: But now he's taking on
his most urgent assignment yet.

03:31.525 --> 03:32.757
Hi.

03:32.759 --> 03:34.459
Come on in.

03:34.461 --> 03:34.492
Come on in.

03:34.527 --> 03:35.193
I'm Albert.

03:35.195 --> 03:36.594
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Alex.

03:36.596 --> 03:37.295
Nice to meet you, sir.

03:37.297 --> 03:38.396
Thank you for coming.

03:38.398 --> 03:38.463
Thank you for coming.

03:38.497 --> 03:41.499
The load you've got here is the
first load of food that Inuvik's

03:41.501 --> 03:44.803
gonna see in the last
week and a half.

03:44.805 --> 03:46.604
They're running out of food.

03:46.606 --> 03:49.174
You gotta make sure to
take care of this load.

03:49.176 --> 03:51.876
They're really short in there.

03:51.878 --> 03:56.214
Narrator: Hauling a load of
food, essential to the survival

03:56.216 --> 04:01.086
- of Inuvik's 3,500 residents...
- This is it.

04:01.088 --> 04:02.887
Off we go.

04:02.889 --> 04:06.691
Narrator: Means facing
the Dempster highway.

04:06.693 --> 04:09.527
You got about 500 miles of bush.

04:09.529 --> 04:12.530
Snow, ice, hills, mountains.

04:12.532 --> 04:17.000
And then we get to the Mackenzie
river and the Arctic ocean.

04:19.904 --> 04:22.307
Narrator: With isolated
wilderness stretching hundreds

04:22.309 --> 04:27.178
of miles in every direction,
it's the last place on Earth a

04:27.180 --> 04:31.149
driver wants to be stranded.

04:31.151 --> 04:36.054
I think there's an awful lot of graves
up here that don't have tombstones.

04:36.056 --> 04:39.324
Plenty of stories of people in
the north who froze to death,

04:39.326 --> 04:45.764
who starved to death, died from
sickness, just disappeared.

04:58.978 --> 05:04.282
Why is it-- [Beeping]

05:04.284 --> 05:06.751
What the hell?

05:06.753 --> 05:08.353
[Engine sputters out]

05:08.355 --> 05:09.287
Okay, we got a problem.

05:09.289 --> 05:13.658
Truck shut down.

05:13.660 --> 05:17.295
Well, that's interesting.

05:17.297 --> 05:22.367
Why would it do that?

05:22.369 --> 05:25.336
Narrator: In the middle of nowhere...
[Buzzes]

05:25.338 --> 05:29.073
Alex is shut down.

05:31.377 --> 05:36.681
Across the continent...
The winter season is also

05:36.683 --> 05:45.623
starting up in Manitoba, as crews
race to build the winter roads.

05:45.625 --> 05:51.796
Built over swampland,
rivers, and frozen lakes...

05:51.798 --> 05:56.201
The winter roads provide only
a few weeks of access to over

05:56.203 --> 06:01.439
150,000 square miles of
Manitoba backcountry.

06:06.312 --> 06:12.050
But this year, arctic weather
patterns have trapped cold air

06:12.052 --> 06:16.855
in the north, leaving Manitoba
with record-high temperatures

06:16.857 --> 06:20.258
and thinner ice
than ever before.

06:20.260 --> 06:20.291
Before.

06:20.359 --> 06:22.727
This year, the season's not
going well for us at all.

06:22.729 --> 06:22.794
Going well for us at all.

06:22.828 --> 06:24.095
Nothing's freezing.

06:24.097 --> 06:25.797
There's water on the roads.

06:25.799 --> 06:27.799
I'm starting to get worried.

06:27.801 --> 06:31.302
Narrator: For the last nine
months, loads have been piling

06:31.304 --> 06:35.607
up at Winnipeg's
Polar Industries.

06:35.609 --> 06:40.879
And for owner Mark Kohaykewych,
closed roads mean the season is

06:40.881 --> 06:42.580
in jeopardy.

06:42.582 --> 06:44.482
We've got a lot of
loads to get out.

06:44.484 --> 06:46.584
The communities and the
contractors that we're working

06:46.586 --> 06:48.653
with are getting desperate.

06:48.655 --> 06:52.156
So we're in a pretty
tight spot right now.

06:52.158 --> 06:54.993
Narrator: With this season's
roads behind schedule...

06:54.995 --> 06:57.228
Good morning, Mark from
Polar Industries here.

06:57.230 --> 06:59.797
Narrator: Mark calls
in the cavalry.

06:59.799 --> 07:00.932
Short season, lots of loads.

07:00.934 --> 07:02.767
So you need some trucks.

07:02.769 --> 07:09.007
Narrator: Last year, Hugh "The Polar
Bear" Rowland raked in the dough...

07:09.009 --> 07:10.842
Bounce that motherfucker!

07:10.844 --> 07:14.178
Narrator: As one of the few
truckers who could turn a profit

07:14.180 --> 07:16.147
hauling on the winter roads.

07:16.149 --> 07:18.316
[Laughs]

07:18.318 --> 07:20.318
Yee-fucking-haw.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.689
Narrator: And this season, Hugh
has decided to double down.

07:24.691 --> 07:26.925
Mark gave me a call, and he said,
"hey, we got a whole bunch

07:26.927 --> 07:27.792
of loads over here."

07:27.794 --> 07:29.961
And, uh, he said, "I could
really use your help again," and

07:29.963 --> 07:32.063
I just told him, I said, "well, I
want a bigger piece of the pie

07:32.065 --> 07:32.830
this year."

07:32.832 --> 07:34.499
I said, "I want a
percentage this time."

07:34.501 --> 07:37.969
So what we did was we
negotiated a percent on gross,

07:37.971 --> 07:41.339
so he's got a little bit more,
uh, more incentive to get these

07:41.341 --> 07:42.774
loads up a little bit quicker.

07:42.776 --> 07:45.710
Narrator: For Hugh, buying
into the short season is a

07:45.712 --> 07:50.315
high-risk gamble that only pays off
if he can deliver enough loads.

07:50.317 --> 07:53.384
Well, I guess I better
phone fucking show.

07:53.386 --> 07:59.557
Narrator: With the clock ticking,
Hugh needs all the help he can get...

07:59.559 --> 08:05.296
And calls in ice road
hothead Rick Yemm.

08:05.298 --> 08:08.166
Getting ready for another ice
road season, got my "friendly

08:08.168 --> 08:10.101
Manitoba" plates to go on.

08:10.103 --> 08:16.140
Narrator: For nearly two decades,
Hugh's had Rick under his wing.

08:16.142 --> 08:17.208
You ever slam my fucking

08:17.210 --> 08:19.911
Truck like that again,
I'll fucking kill ya.

08:19.913 --> 08:23.681
Narrator: And it hasn't
always been easy.

08:23.683 --> 08:26.484
I didn't sign up for this
fucking stupid shit.

08:26.486 --> 08:28.386
Yeah, you did.

08:28.388 --> 08:32.323
Narrator: But at the end of last
season, Rick finally banked

08:32.325 --> 08:36.928
enough to buy his own truck.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.296
Cheers, man.

08:38.298 --> 08:39.397
That was pretty cool.

08:39.399 --> 08:42.900
Narrator: Now, with a rig of his
own, Rick's taken the first

08:42.902 --> 08:46.404
step toward following in
the polar bear's tracks.

08:46.406 --> 08:48.506
Well, he's a successful
businessman.

08:48.508 --> 08:50.274
He makes good
business decisions.

08:50.276 --> 08:52.710
If I do the same things he does,
well, I'm hoping to be the same

08:52.712 --> 08:54.746
successful businessman.

08:54.748 --> 08:59.217
That's that, heh.

08:59.219 --> 09:00.318
Is he here?

09:00.320 --> 09:01.085
His truck's here.

09:01.087 --> 09:02.320
Hey!

09:02.322 --> 09:03.488
Long time, no see.

09:03.490 --> 09:04.389
You guys ready to go?

09:04.391 --> 09:05.823
Yep.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.558
First thing we gotta do is we
gotta get up north, and we

09:07.560 --> 09:09.761
gotta go to Berens river to
rescue a few trailers that have

09:09.763 --> 09:11.863
been stuck up there all year.

09:11.865 --> 09:15.433
Narrator: When last year's
roads melted away, they went

09:15.435 --> 09:22.006
quick, leaving two trailers of construction
supplies stranded in the bush.

09:22.008 --> 09:24.175
The contractor's losing money.

09:24.177 --> 09:25.676
He wants 'em out ASAP.

09:25.678 --> 09:27.311
Roads are just opening up.

09:27.313 --> 09:28.479
They're rough as hell.

09:28.481 --> 09:30.648
They're a little crazy.

09:30.650 --> 09:34.185
And, with the way the forecast
is, they could shut that thing

09:34.187 --> 09:36.020
down in a couple hours.

09:36.022 --> 09:39.190
So I need you guys to
go, like, right now.

09:39.192 --> 09:43.628
Narrator: The road to Berens
river is open, but in warm

09:43.630 --> 09:49.333
temperatures, the ice roads
could close at any time...

09:49.335 --> 09:52.670
First run, the roads are
completely fucked up.

09:52.672 --> 09:57.842
Narrator: Leaving Hugh and Rick
no choice but to go for it.

09:57.844 --> 10:02.313
Well, with our little rescue mission
here, we're just bobtailing in.

10:02.315 --> 10:04.949
Uh, that means we
got no trailer on.

10:04.951 --> 10:07.752
Well, the one thing about bobtailing
when we're going in with no weight--

10:07.754 --> 10:08.853
it's rough.

10:08.855 --> 10:11.289
You get bounced
around pretty good.

10:11.291 --> 10:14.826
Start losing teeth and shit.

10:14.828 --> 10:17.428
If I wanted to be safe, I
wouldn't be doing ice road

10:17.430 --> 10:19.297
trucking to start with.

10:19.299 --> 10:23.367
Yeah, bobtailing's like driving on
marbles when you're on the ice.

10:23.369 --> 10:29.574
You just gotta kind of finesse
it around the corners.

10:29.576 --> 10:35.179
Don't spin out!

10:35.181 --> 10:38.382
Holy fuck!

10:38.384 --> 10:40.017
[Laughs]

10:40.019 --> 10:43.821
We're taking this to a
whole new level this year.

10:43.823 --> 10:48.392
Yeah, she's gonna be
a rough day today.

10:50.929 --> 10:51.929
Oh, frost heave.

10:51.931 --> 10:54.932
[Laughs]

11:00.572 --> 11:01.539
She's a soft son of a bitch

11:01.541 --> 11:06.544
up here.

11:06.546 --> 11:10.548
This is fucked up.

11:10.550 --> 11:13.017
Oh ho ho ho.

11:16.688 --> 11:18.556
[Crash]

11:18.558 --> 11:20.091
[Wheels grinding]

11:20.093 --> 11:21.659
I lost it.

11:21.661 --> 11:24.662
[Bleep]

11:24.664 --> 11:27.899
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Hang on.

11:27.901 --> 11:29.934
Watch out, watch out!

11:29.936 --> 11:32.537
Narrator: - And later...
- Whoa!

11:32.539 --> 11:35.806
Narrator: The rubber
meets the ice.

11:35.808 --> 11:37.475
This is really, really bad.

11:47.369 --> 11:49.169
Good morning, Fairbanks.

11:49.171 --> 11:51.605
The weather forecast
not looking real good.

11:51.607 --> 11:55.910
In fact, they're predicting temperatures
tonight down in the 50-below range.

11:55.912 --> 11:59.480
So you guys need to be aware out there,
don't drive unless you have to.

11:59.482 --> 12:04.018
Narrator: In Alaska, extreme
weather patterns are plunging

12:04.020 --> 12:07.988
the state into a
record-setting deep freeze.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.823
We'll just check that.

12:09.825 --> 12:16.196
Narrator: And when temperatures drop...
The North Slope gears up for the

12:16.198 --> 12:19.366
oil exploration season.

12:19.368 --> 12:20.734
[Horn blares]

12:20.736 --> 12:23.938
But this year, fueled by the
demand for energy across the

12:23.940 --> 12:31.245
country, Alaskan oil exploration
is set to reach an all-time high.

12:31.247 --> 12:37.651
And the only way for heavy machinery
to reach these remote reserves...

12:37.653 --> 12:40.821
Is the legendary Dalton highway.

12:40.823 --> 12:42.089
Yee-hee-haw!

12:42.091 --> 12:44.458
[Horn blares]

12:44.460 --> 12:49.630
Narrator: - This 500-mile gauntlet
of terror... - Oh, fuck.

12:49.632 --> 12:52.633
Narrator: Pushes every
driver to the limit.

12:52.635 --> 12:54.234
This is a nightmare.

12:54.236 --> 12:59.273
Narrator: With steep, twisting
grades, deadly mountain passes...

12:59.275 --> 13:01.342
[Horn honks]

13:01.344 --> 13:06.447
- blinding whiteouts...
- Can't see at all.

13:06.449 --> 13:11.752
Narrator: There's a dead
man for every mile...

13:11.754 --> 13:14.955
And a wreck around
every blind curve.

13:14.957 --> 13:19.393
You drive this road long
enough, something's gonna happen.

13:19.395 --> 13:26.667
Narrator: On the Dalton,
it's not if, but when.

13:26.669 --> 13:27.401
[Horn blares]

13:27.403 --> 13:29.036
Bad weather.

13:29.038 --> 13:30.938
Harsh conditions.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.139
It's not gonna stop us.

13:32.141 --> 13:33.407
[Horn honks]

13:33.409 --> 13:38.178
Narrator: For Carlile manager
Lane Keator and his drivers,

13:38.180 --> 13:43.050
the oil boom means more
loads than ever before.

13:43.052 --> 13:48.122
And this year is starting
at full throttle.

13:48.124 --> 13:50.691
It's gonna be a busy
season on the slope.

13:50.693 --> 13:50.758
On the Slope.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.827
Right out the gate this year, we
gotta move 70 loads of rig parts

13:53.829 --> 13:55.195
in ten days.

13:55.263 --> 13:59.833
Narrator: To keep the fuel
flowing, a multimillion-dollar

13:59.835 --> 14:04.638
oil rig is headed to the Arctic
ocean, and Carlile has just ten

14:04.640 --> 14:09.476
days to move all 3 1/2 million
pounds of industrial metal.

14:09.478 --> 14:10.944
The clock is ticking.

14:10.946 --> 14:12.212
We gotta move.

14:12.214 --> 14:17.217
Narrator: With their reputation
on the line, Lane's playing his ace.

14:17.219 --> 14:20.654
Wanna know if you have what
it takes to drive the haul road?

14:20.656 --> 14:21.622
Check your license.

14:21.624 --> 14:23.924
Does it say "Jack Jessee"?

14:23.926 --> 14:27.428
Narrator: Carlile veteran
Jack Jessee is back.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.063
[Laughs]

14:29.065 --> 14:31.965
Narrator: And he's
focused on one mission.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.233
I've been number one.

14:33.235 --> 14:34.902
I am number one.

14:34.904 --> 14:36.904
And I'm gonna stay number one.

14:37.005 --> 14:39.907
I'm gonna get this thing
moving and lead the pack.

14:39.909 --> 14:44.645
Narrator: Today Jack's first
load is the oil rig's pipe shed.

14:44.647 --> 14:47.181
All right, this
ought to be fun.

14:47.183 --> 14:52.186
Narrator: At 60 feet long and
over 75,000 pounds, Jack's

14:52.188 --> 14:55.122
return to the haul
road won't be easy.

14:55.124 --> 14:57.591
It's gonna be a
pretty good challenge.

14:57.593 --> 15:02.229
But, hey, that's why
Lane's got me doing it.

15:02.231 --> 15:03.330
Morning.

15:03.332 --> 15:04.331
Hey, Lane.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.499
What's going on?

15:05.501 --> 15:07.034
I thought I was supposed
to get an easy load.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.035
This is an easy load.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.237
- Oh, well--
- You're Jack Jessee.

15:10.239 --> 15:12.506
When you're up against it like
we are this year, as busy as

15:12.508 --> 15:15.142
we're gonna be, you gotta
lean on your veterans.

15:15.144 --> 15:19.113
We need to get you up the road
and get a move on 'cause we got

15:19.115 --> 15:21.048
a lot to move here in
the next ten days.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.816
We got a convoy
this morning too.

15:22.818 --> 15:23.550
What?

15:23.552 --> 15:24.551
Yeah.

15:24.553 --> 15:27.855
Narrator: Even with the haul
road ace in the game, the rig

15:27.857 --> 15:30.758
move is pushing
Carlile to the limit.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.725
It's a big project.

15:31.727 --> 15:36.997
Takes a lot of teamwork and a lot of
drivers, so we gotta get some guys.

15:36.999 --> 15:41.902
Narrator: And it means lots
of new faces on the Dalton.

15:41.904 --> 15:43.337
Hey, how's it going?

15:43.339 --> 15:44.638
Good, what's up?

15:44.640 --> 15:45.506
My name's Austin.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.908
I'm the heavy hauler
out of Kenai.

15:47.910 --> 15:52.513
I just came to get
my dispatch sheet.

15:52.515 --> 15:55.482
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's
been with Carlile nearly two

15:55.484 --> 15:58.085
years driving in
Southern Alaska.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.622
Now Lane's called him
up to the big leagues.

16:01.624 --> 16:04.725
I'm 23 years old, but
I look like I'm 16.

16:04.727 --> 16:06.360
I got a young face.

16:06.362 --> 16:09.163
But age doesn't really
matter in my opinion.

16:09.165 --> 16:11.999
Austin's very passionate
about what he does.

16:12.001 --> 16:13.233
I got confidence.

16:13.235 --> 16:16.703
He's got what it takes.

16:16.705 --> 16:20.140
Oh, I'm--I'm Austin, here to
convoy pipe sheds up with you.

16:20.142 --> 16:21.175
You're Austin?

16:21.177 --> 16:22.442
Yes, sir.

16:22.444 --> 16:26.613
I'm here to drive and...
follow you up the road.

16:26.615 --> 16:29.082
[Laughs]

16:29.084 --> 16:32.719
Austin-- We pulled him out
of kindergarten last week.

16:32.721 --> 16:34.354
Taught him how
to drive a truck.

16:34.356 --> 16:36.957
[Laughs]

16:36.959 --> 16:38.358
Okay, Austin.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.159
Get your truck, let's go.

16:39.161 --> 16:40.360
All right.

16:40.362 --> 16:43.697
Well, being young and looking
young, it's hard to get respect.

16:43.699 --> 16:47.034
But once they see me get behind
the wheel and take off, I get

16:47.036 --> 16:49.136
the respect that I want.

16:49.138 --> 16:55.509
Narrator: With the boss behind him,
Austin's joining the rig move, hauling

16:55.511 --> 16:58.779
a 40,000-pound pipe shed frame.

16:58.781 --> 17:03.250
Ready to blow
this popsicle stand.

17:03.252 --> 17:05.051
[Horn honks]

17:05.054 --> 17:06.420
I've always looked up to Jack.

17:06.422 --> 17:11.791
But now that I'm up here,
it's every man for himself.

17:11.794 --> 17:14.161
This ought to be good.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.262
Hopefully he can keep up.

17:16.265 --> 17:20.968
[Horn blares]

17:20.970 --> 17:27.074
Narrator: Across town, another new
face has come to Fairbanks, Alaska.

17:27.076 --> 17:29.309
We're fixing to head over here
to the local choke and puke

17:29.311 --> 17:31.345
and grab something to eat.

17:31.347 --> 17:31.411
And grab something to eat.

17:31.446 --> 17:36.516
Buttermilk biscuits, sausage,
gravy, about ten eggs, big ol'

17:36.518 --> 17:40.787
pot of grits with some cheese
on it, and some fried squirrel.

17:40.789 --> 17:40.854
On it, and some fried squirrel.

17:40.889 --> 17:44.024
Narrator: South Carolina
native Ronald "Porkchop"

17:44.026 --> 17:49.496
Mangum is fueling up before his
first taste of the haul road.

17:49.498 --> 17:51.498
Two big countries.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.866
Two big countries?

17:52.868 --> 17:54.034
Yep.

17:54.036 --> 17:56.136
Everybody knows me by Porkchop.

17:56.138 --> 17:57.604
My family calls me Porkchop.

17:57.606 --> 17:58.939
My friends call me Porkchop.

17:58.941 --> 18:04.778
As you can tell, I
ain't missed a meal.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.080
Certainly, you have some
experience that is appealing to

18:07.082 --> 18:10.050
me, but I guess I don't
understand why Alaska.

18:10.052 --> 18:13.153
[Sighs] When I was kid growing
up, my dad left me when

18:13.155 --> 18:14.588
I was in the fifth grade.

18:14.590 --> 18:17.658
We went from living in nice,
luxurious houses on Hilton Head

18:17.660 --> 18:22.329
Island to Podunk Blythewood, South
Carolina, in a single-wide trailer.

18:22.331 --> 18:23.964
This is my big shot.

18:23.966 --> 18:26.133
I want to have a house
for my wife and kids.

18:26.135 --> 18:28.936
I want to be able to provide for
them and not have to worry

18:28.938 --> 18:30.804
whether we're gonna be able
to to have lights or food or

18:30.806 --> 18:35.842
whatever when I get back home.

18:35.844 --> 18:39.346
What I'm hearing and your
experience and so forth, it

18:39.348 --> 18:41.081
sounds like you're kind of
what we're looking for.

18:41.083 --> 18:41.748
I got this.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.183
Whatever we gotta
do, let's do it.

18:43.185 --> 18:45.786
I might be new, and I might be a
rookie, but when I leave here,

18:45.788 --> 18:47.921
everybody's gonna know who
the hell Porkchop is.

18:47.923 --> 18:48.655
See you guys later.

18:48.657 --> 18:49.456
See ya.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.657
You can't stop the chop.

18:50.659 --> 18:53.393
Narrator: As a new hire...
[Sighs]

18:53.395 --> 18:58.198
Narrator: Porkchop won't be let
loose with a piece of the oil rig.

18:58.200 --> 19:02.669
Instead, he'll be tested with a
load of pipe under the watchful

19:02.671 --> 19:06.106
eye of driver-trainer
Phil Kromm.

19:06.108 --> 19:06.173
Phil Kromm.

19:06.207 --> 19:09.443
When a driver comes to
us, regardless of how much

19:09.445 --> 19:12.546
experience they have anywhere
else in the world, they're a

19:12.548 --> 19:15.749
rookie all over again
here in Alaska.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.652
[Grunting] I'm working
my ass off right now.

19:18.654 --> 19:20.554
[Creaking]

19:20.556 --> 19:22.756
You're going the wrong way.

19:22.758 --> 19:23.724
It's going down.

19:23.726 --> 19:24.658
Is it?

19:24.660 --> 19:25.359
Yeah.

19:25.361 --> 19:27.661
Son of a bitch.

19:27.663 --> 19:28.662
I was going the wrong way.

19:28.664 --> 19:33.834
That's the mistake
you make sometimes.

19:33.836 --> 19:36.003
Can't figure out which
direction it's going when

19:36.005 --> 19:38.472
there's an arrow right on
the side of the trailer.

19:38.474 --> 19:42.642
Porkchop's definitely off to
a rough start this morning.

19:42.644 --> 19:46.680
Narrator: While Porkchop
struggles, 1,900 miles to the

19:46.682 --> 19:52.119
South, in Montana...
Word of big money on the Dalton

19:52.121 --> 19:55.822
has reached a local legend.

19:55.824 --> 19:58.025
We're, uh, headed up
to get a load of logs.

19:58.027 --> 19:58.992
This is my last load.

19:58.994 --> 20:00.293
I'm gonna head out of here.

20:00.295 --> 20:01.094
I'm headed for Alaska.

20:01.096 --> 20:03.930
I'm gonna show 'em I've got
what it takes to move anything

20:03.932 --> 20:05.999
they've got to move.

20:06.001 --> 20:08.168
[Creaks]

20:08.170 --> 20:11.271
Narrator: Rocky Mountain log
hauler Darrell ward has tackled

20:11.273 --> 20:14.875
every challenge the
lower 48 has to offer.

20:14.877 --> 20:16.743
I am the best there is.

20:16.745 --> 20:16.777
I am the best there is.

20:16.811 --> 20:18.645
I mean, I've got 31 years in.

20:18.647 --> 20:18.712
I mean, I've got 31 years in.

20:18.746 --> 20:21.448
I've hauled the logs out
of the Rocky Mountains.

20:21.450 --> 20:24.451
I've built the pipelines
across this country.

20:24.453 --> 20:27.254
I've worked in the oil
fields of North Dakota.

20:27.256 --> 20:29.790
All right, back at it.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.893
Every company I've worked
for, I've been the top dog.

20:32.895 --> 20:34.628
I always am the top load.

20:34.630 --> 20:37.097
I'm always the top position.

20:37.099 --> 20:40.100
There's nobody better.

20:40.102 --> 20:44.971
Narrator: For Darrell, the move
to Alaska means a shot at big money.

20:44.973 --> 20:47.007
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

20:47.009 --> 20:49.443
Narrator: And
a new beginning.

20:49.445 --> 20:51.545
You know, go take
on this new adventure.

20:51.547 --> 20:53.814
And I've got the
freedom to do it.

20:53.816 --> 20:58.418
I spent 21 years married and
gone through a divorce in the

20:58.420 --> 21:03.890
last year and a half, and...
I have a son, Reno.

21:03.892 --> 21:05.459
I'm very proud of him.

21:05.461 --> 21:07.260
He's a senior in high school.

21:07.262 --> 21:10.330
Loves the same thing I
do-- fishing, dirt bikes.

21:10.332 --> 21:11.965
We spend a lot
of time together.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.800
I'll be gone for
a couple months.

21:13.802 --> 21:14.701
Wish me luck.

21:14.703 --> 21:16.002
All right, love you.

21:16.004 --> 21:17.704
Love you too.

21:17.706 --> 21:23.076
It's time to make the money so that I
can do things that we enjoy doing.

21:23.078 --> 21:25.512
I'm off to Fairbanks.

21:25.514 --> 21:26.413
I'm ready for it.

21:26.415 --> 21:29.149
I hope they're ready for me.

21:31.669 --> 21:35.104
Narrator: At the Carlile
office in Fairbanks...

21:35.139 --> 21:37.740
Cold out here, that's for sure.

21:37.742 --> 21:40.343
About 35 below this morning.

21:40.411 --> 21:43.313
Narrator: Montana legend
Darrell Ward is the latest

21:43.315 --> 21:48.651
driver hoping to join the ranks
of the ice road truckers.

21:48.653 --> 21:50.353
Been driving for 31 years.

21:50.355 --> 21:51.888
Rocky mountain log hauler.

21:51.890 --> 21:54.924
Good, we've typically, uh,
found that guys from Montana are

21:54.926 --> 21:57.293
pretty good to-- pretty good fit.

21:57.295 --> 22:00.463
Yep, log haulers are the
best drivers there is.

22:00.465 --> 22:03.299
And they said that you were gonna
put me on somebody to train them?

22:03.301 --> 22:04.567
Uh, no.

22:04.569 --> 22:07.370
But I mean, your trainer's supposed
to ride with me or something.

22:07.372 --> 22:09.539
Yeah, the first
trip is a ride-along.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.441
Maybe do a little driving
on the way back.

22:11.443 --> 22:12.742
Oh, man, don't do that to me.

22:12.744 --> 22:16.279
I understand your enthusiasm,
but I gotta leave that up to my

22:16.281 --> 22:18.615
trainers to see how you do,
and then we'll go from there.

22:18.617 --> 22:19.716
All right.

22:19.718 --> 22:20.383
Okay?

22:20.385 --> 22:22.185
All right, well, I'll be
ready to move up next week.

22:22.187 --> 22:23.753
Thanks.

22:23.755 --> 22:25.388
Probably take a little
longer than that.

22:25.390 --> 22:26.823
All right.

22:26.825 --> 22:29.359
Sometimes you get a guy
that's just arrogant, cocky.

22:29.361 --> 22:32.061
Uh, comes in, tells you how he's
gonna do it, when he's gonna do

22:32.063 --> 22:33.630
it, and why he's gonna do it.

22:33.632 --> 22:38.368
And after last year with Dave, I'll
be paying really close attention.

22:38.370 --> 22:41.938
Narrator: Last season, Lane
took a chance on another Dalton

22:41.940 --> 22:43.373
fortune seeker.

22:43.375 --> 22:47.644
I can't even turn into a fucking
parking lot without you over there.

22:47.646 --> 22:49.379
Narrator: And
it didn't go well.

22:49.381 --> 22:51.514
Think your attitude might
have something to do with it?

22:51.516 --> 22:53.917
I have not had one fucking

22:53.919 --> 22:55.151
bit of fucking attitude.

22:55.153 --> 23:01.824
Are you gonna even let me say
anything here, Mr. Attitude?

23:01.826 --> 23:05.361
Narrator: Today...
I get an oversized load the first load.

23:05.363 --> 23:10.266
Narrator: Trainer Tony Moleski is
bracing for another cocky newcomer.

23:10.268 --> 23:14.337
Check my fifth wheel, make
sure-- make sure it's latched.

23:14.339 --> 23:15.438
Do you do that every time?

23:15.440 --> 23:16.272
Every time.

23:16.274 --> 23:19.108
I got a trainer that doesn't have
the experience that I've got.

23:19.110 --> 23:24.180
So I'm gonna be training one of
their trainers for 'em for a while.

23:24.182 --> 23:25.882
You know, maybe
I'll take his job.

23:25.884 --> 23:29.886
[Horn honks]

23:29.888 --> 23:37.627
Narrator: While Darrell hits the road...
2,000 miles east in Manitoba...

23:37.629 --> 23:40.697
[Clanging]

23:40.699 --> 23:45.435
Hugh and Rick's mission to
rescue two stranded trailers...

23:45.437 --> 23:46.803
I'm in the ditch.

23:46.805 --> 23:50.139
Narrator: Is now a
mission to rescue Hugh.

23:50.141 --> 23:52.542
Holy shit.

23:52.544 --> 23:55.445
That's not a good one.

23:55.447 --> 23:58.181
I didn't make the corner.

23:58.183 --> 24:01.718
I don't want to mention this
or anything, but, uh, that is

24:01.720 --> 24:03.987
Hugh "The Polar Bear" Rowland's
truck that is in the fucking

24:03.989 --> 24:04.687
ditch.

24:04.689 --> 24:10.059
I'm just usually the
first one that does it.

24:10.127 --> 24:14.297
This is just another obstacle
when you're, uh, bobtailing

24:14.299 --> 24:17.900
in the fucking ice roads.

24:17.968 --> 24:20.503
Narrator: The plan is simple.

24:20.505 --> 24:27.977
Chain up... then jerk Polar Bear and
his rig right out of the rough.

24:27.979 --> 24:31.981
Let's get 'er done.

24:31.983 --> 24:34.984
Hang on!

24:39.957 --> 24:42.892
Come on!

24:44.995 --> 24:47.163
[Clattering]

24:47.165 --> 24:51.801
Narrator: So far, Rick's plan
is making things worse, as the

24:51.803 --> 24:56.039
18,000-pound rig
just sinks deeper.

24:56.041 --> 24:56.706
I got you, big bear.

24:56.708 --> 25:00.076
I got you.

25:14.658 --> 25:16.592
Holy fuck.

25:16.594 --> 25:20.963
That's a nightmare.

25:20.965 --> 25:27.070
Narrator: With the chain busted,
they're down to their last tow strap.

25:27.072 --> 25:28.705
This is fucked.

25:28.707 --> 25:31.708
One more.

25:40.350 --> 25:42.485
[Wheels screeching]

25:56.300 --> 25:56.999
[Laughs]

25:57.001 --> 25:58.301
We're out.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.036
[Laughs]

26:00.038 --> 26:01.204
[Horn honks]

26:01.206 --> 26:02.004
[Laughs]

26:02.006 --> 26:02.739
We always get 'er done.

26:02.741 --> 26:04.540
That's the one thing we do do.

26:04.542 --> 26:07.977
He probably pulled
me probably ten times.

26:07.979 --> 26:09.245
But he got me out.

26:09.346 --> 26:13.216
The fucking show to the rescue.

26:13.218 --> 26:13.249
Rescue.

26:13.283 --> 26:18.221
I don't get to gloat very
often, but I saved Hughy.

26:24.795 --> 26:26.062
[Horn honking]

26:26.064 --> 26:29.966
Narrator: Only halfway to
the stranded trailers...

26:29.968 --> 26:32.335
All in a day's
job, I guess, huh?

26:32.337 --> 26:37.607
Narrator: Hugh's big-money
gamble is looking like a long shot.

26:37.674 --> 26:40.610
[Horn honks]

26:40.612 --> 26:46.215
1,800 miles to the west...
[engine coughs]

26:46.217 --> 26:50.753
Alex Debogorski is frozen
on the notorious Dempster.

26:50.755 --> 26:54.590
Oil pressure, brake, air, fuel.

26:54.592 --> 26:58.494
Narrator: Hundreds of
miles from civilization...

26:58.496 --> 27:02.865
If Alex can't get going...
[Engine coughs]

27:02.867 --> 27:06.969
His first trip
could be his last.

27:06.971 --> 27:08.504
I don't have any
regen lights coming on.

27:08.506 --> 27:12.408
[Beeping and clicking]

27:12.410 --> 27:13.843
Okay, we'll see what happens.

27:13.845 --> 27:15.778
[Engine coughs]

27:15.780 --> 27:18.314
[Engine turns over]

27:18.316 --> 27:21.317
[Engine rumbling]

27:23.687 --> 27:26.322
Everything's working.

27:26.324 --> 27:27.423
Guess I didn't have my hat on.

27:27.425 --> 27:30.459
That's what the problem was.

27:33.931 --> 27:35.765
[Laughs]

27:35.767 --> 27:37.600
Got a little bit spooky.

27:37.602 --> 27:45.675
Narrator: Alex is back underway, but
his biggest challenge is still ahead.

27:45.677 --> 27:49.045
The next exciting spot is
gonna be the river crossing.

27:49.047 --> 27:55.051
Narrator: Back-to-back ice crossings
on the peel and Mackenzie rivers.

27:55.053 --> 27:59.188
I'm gonna roll down the ice
here and have a look at it.

27:59.190 --> 28:02.191
[Air brakes hiss]

28:07.164 --> 28:08.931
Well, I'm on the Peel river.

28:08.933 --> 28:11.000
Just taking a look
at the ice here.

28:11.002 --> 28:13.769
Can't really tell the difference
between the ice and the road.

28:13.771 --> 28:18.774
I don't know how deep it is,
and I don't want to find out.

28:18.776 --> 28:21.777
Let's go and do it.

28:29.286 --> 28:34.090
Narrator: Alex heads onto the
river, hoping the ice is thick

28:34.092 --> 28:37.126
enough to keep him out
of the current below.

28:37.128 --> 28:39.128
[Ice cracking]

28:39.130 --> 28:44.400
Generally, you go on the ice,
you take your seatbelt off.

28:44.402 --> 28:48.671
It's not a good idea to be out
on the ice with a seatbelt on.

28:48.673 --> 28:52.041
Unless you're trying to make
yourself easier to be found

28:52.043 --> 28:55.011
at the bottom of the river.

28:58.482 --> 29:01.350
Narrator: - Coming up...
- Already starting to have problems.

29:01.352 --> 29:02.151
Whoa.

29:02.153 --> 29:04.153
Easy, easy, easy!

29:07.946 --> 29:13.551
Narrator: - In the Northwest Territories...
- I don't see any water.

29:13.553 --> 29:15.920
Good thing.

29:15.922 --> 29:21.659
Narrator: Alex Debogorski
braves the shifting ice.

29:21.661 --> 29:24.662
Whoa, boy.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.668
[Faint cracking]

29:30.670 --> 29:33.304
I can hear some cracking.

29:33.306 --> 29:36.307
[Cracking]

29:39.845 --> 29:46.751
Narrator: Cracks on the surface can
cause a trapdoor effect in the ice...

29:46.753 --> 29:53.224
That will swallow a truck whole and
bury the driver in a watery grave.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.260
[Cracking]

29:59.965 --> 30:02.066
Oh, no.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.069
This is really, really bad.

30:07.840 --> 30:12.443
A crack running along
the road beside me.

30:21.587 --> 30:26.457
Narrator: As the ice splits alongside
his wheels... [loud cracking]

30:26.459 --> 30:27.992
Come on, baby.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.527
You can do it.

30:29.529 --> 30:32.530
Whoa.

30:34.933 --> 30:38.870
Narrator: Alex finally reaches
the safety of solid ground.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.705
No problem-o.

30:40.707 --> 30:43.708
[Chuckles]

30:47.946 --> 30:50.248
Worked out fine, we got across.

30:50.250 --> 30:53.251
Next stop, Inuvik.

30:58.690 --> 31:05.529
Narrator: 430 miles to the west...
[Horn blares]

31:05.531 --> 31:07.431
Well, it's 2:15.

31:07.433 --> 31:11.535
Hopefully we can be to Coldfoot, you
know, by a little after dinnertime.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.138
Narrator: Haul road rookie
Austin Wheeler is headed north

31:14.140 --> 31:17.441
with a 40,000-pound
piece of the oil rig.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.043
Well, I'm really excited.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.079
This is my first haul up the road,
and I'd really like to get

31:22.081 --> 31:26.150
up to Prudhoe Bay, drop this
load off, and then head back

31:26.152 --> 31:32.356
tomorrow, if I can, to grab
another one and head back up.

31:32.358 --> 31:40.231
Narrator: And just up the road...
is 12-year veteran Jack Jessee.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.400
Well, with this load that
I've got, it's got a lot of

31:42.402 --> 31:44.235
challenges to go with it.

31:44.237 --> 31:46.070
You know, it's long, for one.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.972
It's tall.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.675
It leans to the left right now.

31:50.677 --> 31:52.510
I'm gonna have to take
it a little more easy.

31:52.512 --> 31:57.415
Make sure it, uh, you know, more
or less just doesn't turn over.

31:57.417 --> 32:01.719
Narrator: Hauling a valuable
75,000-pound load on his first

32:01.721 --> 32:06.223
trip of the season,
Jack's playing it safe.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.226
Well, if the day continues on
like this, you know, it could

32:09.228 --> 32:11.862
easily turn a two-day trip
into a three-day trip.

32:11.864 --> 32:14.298
[Horn honks]

32:14.300 --> 32:17.335
Narrator: But the veteran's
cautious pace is too slow for

32:17.337 --> 32:20.204
the impatient rookie.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.773
I'm convoying with who is
supposedly the ace of the haul

32:22.775 --> 32:26.777
road, but it doesn't
seem like that today.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.312
Kinda sucks.

32:28.314 --> 32:33.784
It makes me not want
to convoy anymore.

32:33.786 --> 32:42.326
Narrator: 75 miles to the north...
[Horn honks]

32:42.328 --> 32:44.962
Okay, you can
slow up a hair more.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.932
Narrator: Dalton rookie
Ronald "Porkchop" Mangum is out

32:47.934 --> 32:51.936
to prove himself to
trainer Phil Kromm.

32:51.938 --> 32:54.338
Slow up a little bit for
this corner coming up.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.974
Yes, sir.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.142
No need to kiss my ass.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.410
Just drive.

32:59.412 --> 33:04.048
Yes, sir.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.884
Narrator: And now he's about
to face off with one of the

33:06.886 --> 33:10.654
haul road's toughest obstacles.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.523
We're headed for
the roller coaster.

33:12.525 --> 33:16.427
This is your first big test.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.964
There's definitely been trucks
taken out on this hill.

33:19.966 --> 33:23.000
Narrator: The roller coaster
is one of the most severe drops

33:23.002 --> 33:30.508
on the Dalton, and the steep grade
changes require precision gear shifting.

33:34.479 --> 33:37.314
Just a little nervous about it.

33:37.316 --> 33:40.584
Oh, lordy, have mercy.

33:49.161 --> 33:53.497
Go ahead and drop one gear
and just roll on through.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.007
Holy fucking shit.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.279
Just take it easy
a little bit here.

34:08.281 --> 34:10.681
Don't lug her down too
far getting out of here.

34:10.683 --> 34:13.117
I got it.

34:13.119 --> 34:16.053
You're grinding the
gear a little bit there.

34:16.054 --> 34:20.224
Just don't want to get
ahead of ourselves.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.226
[Gears grinding]

34:22.228 --> 34:24.862
There you go grinding
the transmission again.

34:24.864 --> 34:27.398
Get to doing it too much, and
that just-- eventually, you're

34:27.400 --> 34:30.367
gonna lose the transmission.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.101
[Gears grind]

34:31.103 --> 34:34.839
Damn!

34:34.841 --> 34:37.942
Make sure you're on your
side at a place like this.

34:37.944 --> 34:40.945
That's far enough, pull over.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.385
[Exhales heavily]

34:48.387 --> 34:49.320
Man, that was intense.

34:49.322 --> 34:50.020
Whoa, watch it, watch it!

34:50.022 --> 34:51.956
Move back to the center.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.290
All right, you're done driving.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.558
Pull over.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.826
I've seen all I need to see.

34:55.828 --> 35:01.365
I'm gonna drive the
rest of the way.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.968
I don't know what Phil's deal
is, but if Phil's got a problem

35:03.970 --> 35:07.138
with me or what Phil thinks I'm
doing wrong, you know what?

35:07.140 --> 35:08.305
Hey, I'm ready.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.673
I'm not a steering
wheel holder.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.276
I'm a truck driver.

35:12.278 --> 35:17.181
What I see in Porkchop
is an average driver.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.217
We're not looking for
average drivers.

35:20.219 --> 35:26.490
My responsibilities as a trainer
are to weed out the undesirables.

35:28.327 --> 35:33.231
Narrator: 400 miles north
of Fairbanks, Alaska...

35:33.233 --> 35:34.833
I'm not making you
nervous over here, am I?

35:34.835 --> 35:35.500
No.

35:35.502 --> 35:37.068
Staring at your gauges.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.603
No, my gauges are all good.

35:38.605 --> 35:42.040
[Laughs]

35:42.042 --> 35:44.843
Narrator: Cocky Montana
legend Darrell Ward is

35:44.845 --> 35:48.146
auditioning for a
new life in Alaska.

35:48.148 --> 35:50.215
Yeah, so you really don't
have much more ties as soon as

35:50.217 --> 35:52.317
your son graduates
down there then.

35:52.319 --> 35:52.951
Yeah.

35:52.953 --> 35:57.389
[Horn honking]

35:57.391 --> 35:59.958
So is that why you
decided to come to Alaska?

35:59.960 --> 36:00.759
It's a perfect life for me.

36:00.761 --> 36:05.063
I can come up here and spend, you
know, six months out of the

36:05.065 --> 36:07.332
year up here and six months
out of the year down there.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.700
Something like that, you know.

36:08.702 --> 36:10.135
Yeah.

36:10.137 --> 36:12.604
Narrator: So far,
Darrell's had a smooth ride.

36:12.606 --> 36:15.307
[Horn blares]

36:15.309 --> 36:19.311
But on the haul road, anything
that can go wrong...

36:19.313 --> 36:21.680
Looks like we're
having light issues.

36:21.682 --> 36:25.317
Narrator: Will.

36:28.754 --> 36:29.688
Ugh.

36:29.690 --> 36:31.756
Got a breaker, don't I?

36:31.758 --> 36:33.191
You got backup lights?

36:33.193 --> 36:34.960
I don't have
load lights either.

36:34.962 --> 36:35.861
Wow.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.195
Yeah, you got nothing.

36:37.197 --> 36:40.031
You got nothing.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.766
This ain't good.

36:41.768 --> 36:43.034
Hold up.

36:43.036 --> 36:46.905
I'm gonna jump out here and
take a look at the fuse box

36:46.907 --> 36:51.309
and see if I can see
what's going on.

36:51.311 --> 36:54.145
Narrator: Stopped in the
road with no lights...

36:54.147 --> 36:56.014
I have no cargo
lights or anything.

36:56.016 --> 36:59.351
Narrator: The 35,000-pound
truck is a deadly, invisible

36:59.353 --> 37:02.954
road block for oncoming traffic.

37:02.956 --> 37:04.022
There it is.

37:04.024 --> 37:06.291
Yeah, I got a blown fuse.

37:06.293 --> 37:08.760
Are you gonna try a
different fuse in there?

37:08.762 --> 37:14.299
I don't have a panel on this,
so it doesn't give me what's what.

37:14.301 --> 37:18.036
I'm gonna trade it
with these right here.

37:24.844 --> 37:27.812
Try it.

37:33.185 --> 37:33.919
There you go.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.654
You got it.

37:35.656 --> 37:37.122
Right on, we got light.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.591
[Horn blares]

37:39.659 --> 37:42.861
All right, cool.

37:45.031 --> 37:45.730
I'm the best motherfucker

37:45.732 --> 37:46.998
out here.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.466
[Laughs]

37:48.468 --> 37:50.502
That's cool for you to
have that opinion, you know.

37:50.504 --> 37:55.407
But I will guarantee you, if you say
that too much, it's going to bite you.

37:55.409 --> 37:59.144
Narrator: 40 minutes later,
the Montana log hauler pulls

37:59.146 --> 38:05.550
into Prudhoe Bay and racks up
his first load of the season.

38:05.552 --> 38:09.454
I'm ready to hit the road
again in the morning, run

38:09.456 --> 38:12.223
the truck by myself, you know.

38:12.225 --> 38:13.558
I'm good to go.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.560
I'm ready.

38:15.562 --> 38:19.464
He's a very confident driver, but,
uh, we've only got half the trip done.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.099
You know, things could
change tomorrow.

38:21.101 --> 38:24.569
We'll see how it goes.

38:24.571 --> 38:28.940
Narrator: While Darrell wraps
up, across the yard, another

38:28.942 --> 38:32.110
rookie arrives in the
passenger's seat.

38:32.112 --> 38:34.846
I don't know about
this Porkchop guy.

38:34.848 --> 38:37.849
I'm not sure he's gonna
make it up here.

38:37.851 --> 38:40.285
[Grunts]

38:40.287 --> 38:42.988
[Sighs]

38:42.990 --> 38:48.994
Narrator: And 450 miles to the east...
Alex survived his first run on

38:48.996 --> 38:54.299
the deadly Dempster,
bringing food to Inuvik.

38:54.301 --> 38:57.402
The truck has a few kinks in
it, but, uh, got the load here,

38:57.404 --> 38:59.571
so I can't complain.

38:59.573 --> 39:01.906
Narrator: At the close of the
first day of the haul road

39:01.908 --> 39:08.279
season, a rookie and
veteran share the lead.

39:08.281 --> 39:11.282
[Wind whistling]

39:13.919 --> 39:19.824
300 miles south of Prudhoe Bay...
[Wind whistling]

39:19.826 --> 39:21.059
Okay.

39:21.061 --> 39:23.461
Narrator: Jack and Austin are
slowly making their way up the

39:23.463 --> 39:26.965
Dalton with oversized rig loads.

39:26.967 --> 39:29.367
You can see the snow blowing
over the road, so that's a good

39:29.369 --> 39:32.037
indication that, you know, the
wind's blowing pretty hard.

39:32.039 --> 39:36.074
But, uh, nothing
we can't handle.

39:36.076 --> 39:39.177
Narrator: All trip Jack's
been playing it safe, but now

39:39.179 --> 39:41.679
mother nature's
changing the game.

39:41.681 --> 39:42.580
We're in a crunch.

39:42.582 --> 39:44.616
We gotta get this done.

39:44.618 --> 39:46.718
But we're already starting
to have problems.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.321
I got this wind
I'm dealing with.

39:50.323 --> 39:57.562
Narrator: Wide open on one side...
Jack's load is catching

39:57.564 --> 40:00.331
the 60-mile-per-hour
winds like a sail.

40:00.333 --> 40:03.334
This load that I've got is
leaning pretty hard to the left.

40:03.336 --> 40:10.408
The wind's supposed to be blowing from
the east, which means to the left.

40:10.410 --> 40:17.082
And if that wind picks up, I mean, it
could just lay this thing on its side.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.619
Easy, easy.

40:21.621 --> 40:24.622
Easy!

40:28.461 --> 40:31.429
Whoa.

40:31.431 --> 40:32.897
Holy crap.

40:32.899 --> 40:36.234
Jack's trailer just got hit by a gust
of wind, and it reared up really bad.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.237
I thought he was
gonna tip over.

40:41.740 --> 40:46.211
That was a hell
of a gust there.

40:46.213 --> 40:48.880
Whew.

40:48.882 --> 40:52.150
[Clears throat]

40:52.152 --> 40:54.052
Jack, you on here?

40:54.054 --> 40:56.488
Yeah, did you see that?

40:56.490 --> 40:58.156
Dude, that was crazy.

40:58.158 --> 41:02.494
I swear I saw the right side of
your trailer off the ground.

41:02.496 --> 41:03.228
Yeah, I felt that one.

41:03.230 --> 41:05.697
I felt that one big time.

41:05.699 --> 41:06.865
Big time.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.868
Hey, Jack, you know...

41:11.871 --> 41:14.772
[Laughs]

41:19.478 --> 41:20.745
I was just letting you know.

41:20.747 --> 41:23.748
It's a possibility.

41:25.818 --> 41:28.319
I'm not sure Austin is really
old enough to understand

41:28.321 --> 41:30.288
everything about
the road up here.

41:30.290 --> 41:34.225
You know, if that would've came
off into the oncoming traffic

41:34.227 --> 41:40.598
with another vehicle there,
somebody would probably be dead.

41:40.600 --> 41:45.236
We're just gonna spend the night
in Coldfoot, do it tomorrow.

41:45.238 --> 41:48.573
Be safer that way.

41:48.575 --> 41:51.176
Narrator: With one close call
and the weather getting worse by

41:51.178 --> 41:58.516
the minute... Jack makes the
call to shut down for the night.

41:58.518 --> 42:00.051
God.

42:00.053 --> 42:02.754
Narrator: But the veteran's
decision isn't sitting well with

42:02.756 --> 42:05.223
his impatient convoy partner.

42:05.225 --> 42:07.492
I really wanted to get
to Prudhoe Bay tonight.

42:07.494 --> 42:10.128
Ain't no way we're
getting over that pass.

42:10.130 --> 42:12.463
I really don't
want to stay here.

42:12.465 --> 42:14.866
Well, you ain't
got much choice.

42:14.868 --> 42:16.501
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.

42:16.503 --> 42:19.304
It's gonna take us forever.

42:19.306 --> 42:21.606
I'd rather convoy with somebody
that doesn't take their fucking

42:21.608 --> 42:24.242
sweet-ass time like this.

42:24.244 --> 42:28.046
Somebody that wants to get
work done and go up the road.

42:28.048 --> 42:29.781
Austin may be
gung-ho for it.

42:29.783 --> 42:33.051
He may think that it's
exciting to do this.

42:33.053 --> 42:37.488
When you're young, you
kind of feel invincible.

42:37.490 --> 42:41.759
I'm not making any
money sitting here.

42:41.761 --> 42:43.294
It's very aggravating.

42:43.296 --> 42:44.762
I've got seniority.

42:44.764 --> 42:46.464
It's my call.

42:46.466 --> 42:48.466
If he has a problem with it,
he can just sleep on it.

42:48.468 --> 42:50.768
They should name
it Ice Road Truckers,

42:50.770 --> 42:57.041
the story of how Austin has to
put up with Jack's bullshit.

42:57.043 --> 43:01.312
Narrator: This season on Ice
Road Truckers... [horn blares]

43:01.314 --> 43:02.313
Oh, fuck.

43:02.315 --> 43:03.381
Wahoo!

43:03.382 --> 43:07.849
The dash for the cash has
drivers our for blood.

43:08.029 --> 43:10.468
- That's invading...
- Tried to get pushed around...

43:10.503 --> 43:13.425
But as the ice road heats up...

43:14.867 --> 43:16.298
I don't want to
do this anymore.

43:16.806 --> 43:19.472
Man and machine
will break down.

43:20.316 --> 43:21.647
♪ showed up.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.120
Bunch of fucking bullshit.

43:24.155 --> 43:26.262
Holy fuck.
