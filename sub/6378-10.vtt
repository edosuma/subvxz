WEBVTT

00:45.671 --> 00:47.286
Eric?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.300
Godric is gone.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.302
I know.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.973
I'm so sorry.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.336
What are you dreaming about?

02:17.763 --> 02:19.378
Bill.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.184
This kind of reminds me
of that bus ride back from all-state.

02:26.772 --> 02:31.232
Nothing looks exactly the way I left it.
Know what I mean?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.774
I've never been away before.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.692
Seems like something's different
to me though.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.573
Yeah.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.534
What the hell?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.458
Oh, look at this guy.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.132
-Let go. Let go of me.
-Let me into them man panties.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.592
Let me into them drawers.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.177
They just ran right in front of me.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.394
Are you all right?

03:17.406 --> 03:20.694
-Hey, what the hell's wrong with your eyes?
-Let's go.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.700
-Wait, wait, where you going?
-We gotta find Sam.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.280
It's almost time, man.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.723
What do you think?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.552
I think you've outdone yourself.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.354
Oh, feathers. Perfection.

05:29.079 --> 05:35.200
I'm thinking more meat.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.743
Five more pounds of ground chuck?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.957
Think about who this is for.
Let's aim higher.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.295
Corn-fed Kobe it is.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.005
You're finally getting it, Karl.

05:49.558 --> 05:53.847
I want the two of you
to bring me the most expensive meat.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.935
Organs, kidneys, livers,
anything you can find.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.771
You want us to go kill something
so it's extra fresh?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.778
No, don't worry.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.570
l have other people bringing us
something living to sacrifice.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.122
-Any sign of anybody outside?
-No.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.836
Hold on.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.261
No bug eyes here. Just a hangover.

06:30.432 --> 06:34.300
-Thanks for going over there.
-The station was totally empty.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.685
Cells were all wide open.
They think I'm a bad cop.

06:38.523 --> 06:42.436
You should see the square.
Looks like New York City or something.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.604
People banging their heads on posts,
graffiti everywhere.

06:47.365 --> 06:52.280
People pissing all over the sidewalk.
This whole town's gone down the crapper.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.661
Yeah, trust me, I know.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.699
I got no idea how we're gonna deal
with a goddamn maenad.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.539
A mae-what?

07:03.715 --> 07:07.333
Wait, you don't remember
any of what I told you last night...

07:08.011 --> 07:11.970
...before you passed out and spent the day
in bed sleeping off your bender?

07:12.140 --> 07:15.758
You said Maryann Forrester
was to blame for all of this...

07:15.936 --> 07:19.019
...the bug eyes and the craziness.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.773
Yeah, and the people showing up dead
with their hearts cut out.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.184
-In the back seat of your car?
-She did that?

07:25.362 --> 07:26.852
Yeah.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.028
She killed Daphne too.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.363
Oh, fuck me.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.030
We got another serial killer.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.997
Andy, listen.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.910
She is a supernatural creature.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.789
She's immortal. She has powers.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.380
And she's not leaving till she gets
what she wants, which I think is me.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.680
What's she want you for?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.557
I think to cut out my heart
while a bunch of naked people watch...

07:58.061 --> 08:03.397
...all for Dionysus or Satan
or some god who has horns.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.231
And people thought I was crazy
because I thought I saw a pig.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.736
Well, you did see a pig.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.648
And you were right,
that pig was a part of all this.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.817
That pig was...

08:16.246 --> 08:19.283
...doing some of Maryann's
dirty work for her.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.956
Well, if what you say is true...

08:23.128 --> 08:24.868
...we need to kill that bitch.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.423
She don't die, remember?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.638
-Hey, Arlene.
-Sam, you gotta come to Merlotte's.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.645
They've got Terry,
and they're coming for me next.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.608
Well, Arlene, I've already seen y'all
caught up in Maryann's weirdness.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.691
Oh, Jesus, I know,
but she's after us now, and she's crazy.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.235
I mean, she is Hannibal Lecter crazy.
And I'm scared she's gonna get my kids.

08:57.412 --> 09:01.781
And nobody's even picking up the phone
at the sheriff's office.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.076
All right. All right, I'll be right there.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.377
This is Jason Stackhouse.
Just wanna let y'all know...

09:11.551 --> 09:14.759
...a couple of folks got hit by a car
up on the square.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.430
But they-- They ran off.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.010
Ask them what the heck's going on
all over town.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.342
And if somebody
could call me back and tell me...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.353
...if we've been attacked
by terrorists or what--

09:25.982 --> 09:27.938
Fucking answering machine
at the sheriff's.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.225
There's something seriously wrong
in Bon Temps.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.268
-I can feel it.
-We||...

09:32.447 --> 09:37.157
...if it ain't the vampire
and his vampire lover.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.530
There's those fucking eyes again.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.406
-Mother, come back here.
-Oh, thank God you're home.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.371
-She's gone, like, totally batshit.
-What the devil--?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.627
-I had nothing to do with it, I swear.
-Move.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.835
-I thought it was a bad reaction to diet pills.
-Get out of my way.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.341
But practically the whole town's
got these eyes.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.174
-How long has she been like this?
-Since last night.

09:58.348 --> 10:03.342
And I will be for as long as it takes
for him to get his offering.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.181
That sounds fucking fucked up.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.222
She's been on about Sam,
how they're gonna offer him to god.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.812
Why don't you offer yourself up to me,
Jason Stackhouse?

10:11.986 --> 10:17.026
You dirty little monkey.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.199
-Mama!
-Does she ever calm down?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.033
Playing Wii gets her to focus,
but I wouldn't call it calm.

10:25.708 --> 10:30.828
I'm gonna crack open
your fucking skull, bitch.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.542
So she says god is coming?

10:33.716 --> 10:37.584
Yes, and everybody's at Merlotte's so they
can catch Sam and take him to Maryann's.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.218
Maryann's? Where's that?

10:39.389 --> 10:42.301
-lt's-- Well, it's your house.
-What?

10:42.475 --> 10:47.720
Yeah. They're gonna rip that boy open
and serve him up like barbecue.

10:48.898 --> 10:52.857
Hoyt, has anyone been attacked
by something with claws?

10:53.194 --> 10:57.403
I heard Arlene say that woman you found
in Andy's car had her back scratched up.

10:57.699 --> 11:01.567
And I also heard somebody say that Daphne
had some kind of weird scar on her back.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.450
The new waitress at Merlotte's?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.078
-There's a new waitress?
-Suck on that, alien fucker!

11:06.249 --> 11:09.207
-We should talk to her.
-She's dead.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.413
She had her heart cut out
like the other one.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.419
-Fudge.
-l'm going to Merlotte's...

11:13.590 --> 11:16.081
...and find out what the hell
is happening on my turf.

11:16.259 --> 11:20.047
If this is the creature we think it might be,
you don't wanna go anywhere near it.

11:20.221 --> 11:25.090
Mr. Compton, I ain't about to sit back
and let monsters destroy my town.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.760
Jason, this would be one of those times
to use your head.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.887
Oh, lam.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.272
I ain't never been so clear
in my whole life.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.436
This here is the war
I've been training for.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.400
-Jason--
-He can take care of himself.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.314
We've seen that.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.778
Be careful, you hear?
Drive your car straight to Merlotte's...

11:45.955 --> 11:49.447
...get inside as fast as you can,
and do not go into the woods by yourself.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.957
I won't.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.460
-I mean it.
-I know. Come here.

11:57.884 --> 11:58.999
And where's Tara?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.802
She's been partying pretty hard
over at Mary--

12:03.681 --> 12:06.593
It's just something that people say.
"Party over at Maryann's."

12:06.768 --> 12:09.009
-I gotta get over there.
-After you.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.354
Should I have gone with them?

12:13.524 --> 12:16.652
And leave me alone here with her?
No fucking way.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.484
Arlene?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.532
You here?

12:31.376 --> 12:33.332
Empty.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.458
-Just like the sheriff's office.
-No.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.793
There's people here.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.212
I can smell them.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.180
Arlene?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.844
Sam?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.142
Oh, thank you, Sam, for coming so fast.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.185
I know how much
punctuality means to you.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.145
Are you all right?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.148
I am now.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.410
Because soon he'll be getting what's his.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.835
-Oh, shit.
-Not this shit again.

13:34.731 --> 13:39.646
Hey, at least shoot the cheap liquor.
Bottom shelf, bottom shelf.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.736
We call this move "stress inoculation."

13:49.078 --> 13:50.614
Fuck.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.078
-Come on. Back door.
-They're getting away!

14:00.256 --> 14:02.042
Go get him.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.624
Follow me.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.090
We're gonna get you, Sam Merlotte.
We're gonna feed on you.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.765
Kick!

14:09.932 --> 14:12.719
-Hard!
-Cut his feet off!

14:12.894 --> 14:14.850
Freaks!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.264
Motherfucker.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.978
ln here. In here.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.112
Damn it, this door don't lock
from the inside.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.785
-I can't hold it.
-Here.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.118
Okay, that'll do it.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.461
Hold up a sec.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.348
We have our EPW right where we want him.
And there ain't no place for him to go.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.430
-And what does that mean?
-It means we have secured the target.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.810
Mission accomplished.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.148
Bodehouse.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.526
Go call Maryann
and tell her she can come pick him up.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.483
We are fucked.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.991
-We're still alive.
-For now.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.828
What are we gonna do?
We gonna have to kill them all?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.948
Even if we could,
these are our friends and neighbors.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.992
And cousins.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.831
Right.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.669
We can't kill them.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.836
We are fucked.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.963
Yes, we are.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.444
-HeI/o?
-Hi. Peanut?

15:52.618 --> 15:55.451
Oh, you sound nice.

15:55.955 --> 16:00.415
It burns where I'm tied up.
It burns like fire, Mama.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.578
Tying her up's not making her better.

16:06.716 --> 16:11.301
I done told you, it's for her own good.
Ours too.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.592
Tara. Tara, baby.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.932
Tell your mama what you need.

16:25.568 --> 16:29.060
Tara Mae. Tara, you stronger
than whatever this is, and you know it.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.069
Now get the fuck up out of there.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.612
If only Miss Jeanette were still alive.

16:39.790 --> 16:44.784
She don't need no damn backwoods witch.
She need Thorazine and a padded cell.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.464
Bless the Lord, O my soul...

16:54.931 --> 16:58.844
...and all that is within me.
Bless his holy name...

16:59.018 --> 17:01.475
...and forget not all his benefits.

17:02.271 --> 17:06.981
Who forgives all your iniquities.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.018
Who heals you of all your diseases.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.814
Who redeems your life from destruction.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.151
Hallelujah, God.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.580
Jesus and I agree to see other people.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.913
Now, that don't mean we don't still talk
from time to time.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.168
You've been good to my Tara.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.667
lfl hadn't left such a hole in this girl...

17:33.844 --> 17:37.052
...maybe whatever's in there
wouldn't have crawled in.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.180
I kicked her out on her birthday.

17:41.018 --> 17:45.136
l was feeling all poor, pitiful me
because of the shit I had brought on myself.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.813
If I wasn't acting
like a stupid little bitch...

17:47.984 --> 17:51.647
...I would've seen trouble coming after her
and I would've handled that shit.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.276
He's coming. He's on his way.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.494
And he's gonna kill us all.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.467
What in God's name?

18:21.017 --> 18:25.602
Whatever the hell it is, it reeks.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.054
Tara?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.765
Tara!

19:08.564 --> 19:12.182
-Lafayette, where is Tara?
-She with me.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.976
I need to know
when you gonna be back in town.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.566
I'm here
in what used to be my living room.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.106
Sook, you gonna have to get up
out that house now.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.740
ls Tara okay?

19:21.911 --> 19:25.324
I ain't half as worried about her
as I am about you in that fucking house.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.456
-Get out. Run.
-Be right there.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.241
Come on.

19:31.379 --> 19:36.373
-What are you doing in my house?
-This is not your house.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.086
It is now.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.962
I strongly suggest
you remove yourself immediately.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.131
My, you found yourself
quite the specimen.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.723
Though I daresay there's nothing
stopping him from one day leaving you cold.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.398
You don't scare me.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.275
Sookie, go now.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.068
Yes, ravage me.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.407
Ravage me.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.324
Bill? Bill! What did you do to him?

20:17.091 --> 20:19.457
What are you?

20:19.635 --> 20:22.297
None of your business.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.349
Let's get out of here.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.097
That was fun.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.107
What are you?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.790
Aren't you glad I didn't
take your advice and quit drinking?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.461
This could save our lives.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.209
If I'd left this town
when I wanted to...

20:59.383 --> 21:01.840
...nobody would be in this situation.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.504
Don't beat yourself up, Sam.
You been real good to this town.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.219
Even if you are a sometimes-nudist.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.679
What if Terry had shot that guy in the head
instead of the shoulder?

21:15.316 --> 21:17.682
People are gonna start dying soon.

21:17.860 --> 21:22.695
People are already dying.
Nancy Levoir, Daphne....

21:23.032 --> 21:24.818
Hell, I never even knew her last name.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.525
Landry.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.619
Daphne Landry.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.502
If that was even her real name.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.082
I heard y'all was close.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.382
-l'm real sorry.
-Thanks.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.130
When I was growing up...

21:46.305 --> 21:48.216
...I had a nanny.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.517
Her name was Annie.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.092
Annie the nanny.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.846
She used to say to me...

21:57.566 --> 22:01.900
...that in the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man was king.

22:03.697 --> 22:09.112
I think she told me that because
she thought I was one of the blind.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.201
Butyou”.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.912
...you got the burden
of being the one-eyed man.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.874
lenvythat

22:21.632 --> 22:23.793
l have no idea what you're talking about.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.884
I don't either.

23:02.882 --> 23:03.917
Sam?

23:04.425 --> 23:08.634
Do you know anybody
named Peanut Birch?

23:09.847 --> 23:11.257
| wish I could remember.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.673
I know there's something
I was supposed to do.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.095
Come on, hard.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.138
Asshole.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.648
Oh, Mama.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.154
That's good pussy.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.833
Hey!

23:44.548 --> 23:46.288
This party's over!

23:55.184 --> 23:58.642
Come on!

23:59.647 --> 24:00.932
Hey, don't stop.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.269
-What the hell is wrong with you people?
-Get back here. Lick it up.

24:15.871 --> 24:16.906
Come on, now.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.703
-What happened?
-Don't stop.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.331
What you gotta go do that for?

24:26.674 --> 24:27.709
Piece of shit.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.088
-Let's go.
-Hey, asshole--

24:37.393 --> 24:39.054
Hey, Terry.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.846
-Terry?
-Come here.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.227
-Ambush!
-Come here.

24:42.398 --> 24:46.061
-Ambush!
-Okay, stay chill.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.396
Nobody needs to get hurt.

24:49.154 --> 24:52.442
-Yeah! Nail her!
-Yeah!

24:54.535 --> 24:55.775
Yeah, yeah!

24:56.286 --> 24:59.244
Wait. Stop!

25:00.499 --> 25:02.239
Don't hurt my special lady.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.410
Do it. I need a haircut anyway, baby.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.458
-No!
-Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.419
Time out.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.260
Time the fuck out.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.594
All right, Stackhouse.

25:19.309 --> 25:23.643
-Name your demands.
-Okay, here's how it's gonna be.

25:23.814 --> 25:27.272
Y'all gonna leave, every last one of you.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.566
Leave us alone,
and then you can have her.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.782
All right.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.494
The order is to retreat.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.496
Immediately, goddamn it.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.784
When I give an order, you fucking follow it.
Now get on out of here.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.669
We will unfuck this situation
at a later date.

25:50.132 --> 25:54.341
Move it. Fall out.
Left, left, left, right, left.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.299
Fall out. Double time. Let's go.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.340
All right, Stackhouse,
you're gonna hand her over.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.851
Keep moving. Move. The faster you move,
the quicker you get her.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.809
Oh, baby. My hero.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.316
I love it when you talk all military like that.
Where's your guns, baby?

26:14.114 --> 26:15.775
Bill?

26:17.326 --> 26:18.566
I'm all right.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.656
No, you are not all right.
None of this is all right.

26:22.164 --> 26:26.032
-I'm calling Eric.
-I will not turn to Eric.

26:26.210 --> 26:30.670
-|'ve gotta get you to Dr. Ludwig.
-Sookie, what happened back there?

26:31.757 --> 26:34.464
-What did you do to her?
-I don't know, I swear.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.634
It was Maryann that attacked me
in the woods.

26:37.805 --> 26:42.174
Even though I don't have a scar, I could feel
on my back when she was touching me.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.342
-I will kill her.
-Good.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.514
How?

26:48.232 --> 26:53.272
If Tara has been under Maryann's influence,
maybe she can be of some help to us.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.947
Give me your wrist so I can heal.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.835
Sam, it's Stackhouse.
You can come on out.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.872
They're gone.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.288
Look, I got rid of all them
saucer-eyed motherfuckers.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.501
Bullshit.

27:16.218 --> 27:19.756
I swear on my gran's grave.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.931
Oh, Andy, hey.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.187
-Let's see your eyes.
-My eyes?

27:31.233 --> 27:34.566
Now, get out here.
I locked all the doors.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.360
-Hey.
-Thanks, Jason.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.244
But I don't think they're gonna let up
till they get me.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.571
How the hell did you get them out?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.956
I threatened to shoot nails
into Arlene's brain.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.742
But, guys, come here.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.412
If we're gonna get out of here,
we're gonna need even a bigger divergence.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.918
There's Sam Merlotte. Get him.

28:01.096 --> 28:05.009
That ain't exactly what I was talking about,
but you work with what you got. Go.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.116
Sam Merlotte.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.486
There's no escaping, Sam Merlotte.

28:27.664 --> 28:31.623
The God Who Comes
always gets what he comes for.

28:33.420 --> 28:37.288
And as for you, Jason Stackhouse,
notcooL

28:37.466 --> 28:40.674
Ain't no normal god
gonna come nowhere near you people.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.629
God ain't gonna be happy with you, Jason.
I bet he'll eat you.

28:46.683 --> 28:51.143
Come to think of it, I always wanted
to know what human flesh tastes like.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.689
Guys. You guys,
you gotta save yourselves.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.443
-We'll get you out of here, Sam.
-And then what?

28:59.613 --> 29:02.776
She's not gonna let up. Ever.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.612
No. I'm ending this.

29:07.454 --> 29:11.493
-No fucking way.
-Maybe this will all stop with me.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.449
No!

29:35.023 --> 29:36.524
Tara.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.562
Tara, would you snap the fuck out of it?

29:46.159 --> 29:50.653
This has got to be the worst
motherfucking intervention in history.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.910
Oh, thank God. Sook.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.539
Hey.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.921
How's it going?

30:06.096 --> 30:09.554
Never been better in my whole
goddamn life. Come back later.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.592
There's no such thing as later
during finals week.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.101
-Calc so blows.
-Excuse me.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.436
Excuse me.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.057
I ain't selling tonight,
cream cheese, okay?

30:20.402 --> 30:23.565
-Come on, I'll pay extra.
-You ain't hearing me.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.604
Well, I ain't leaving till I get the V.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.238
Oh, you are leaving.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.874
Look, slow your roll. It ain't even me.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.912
Talk to your boy Eric.
He the one got me pushing the shit.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.795
Where is she?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.590
You can come on in.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.257
Tara?

30:59.399 --> 31:00.605
What's happened to you?

31:00.776 --> 31:04.234
Get me the fuck out of here,
you stupid cunt, or I will kill you.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.650
We're losing her, Sook.

31:19.753 --> 31:20.993
It's all...

31:22.547 --> 31:24.287
...dark.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.922
Nothing.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.966
-You see into her head?
-Stop trying to rape my brain.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.220
I can't see or hear anything.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.473
It's not her. It's....

31:34.643 --> 31:37.510
-She's gone.
-Don't say that, Sook. She in there.

31:37.687 --> 31:41.771
-Just-- Just keep trying.
-I know, but what am I supposed to do?

31:41.942 --> 31:44.979
You have to go further into her mind
than you ever have before.

31:57.916 --> 32:02.330
You try and kill yourself?
I don't blame you, with your fucked-up life.

32:10.679 --> 32:14.513
There's something I can't cross.
An abyss.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.299
-I will glamour her.
-What?

32:17.477 --> 32:20.014
-It may help.
-I don't wanna hurt her.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.680
If we leave her like this,
who knows what harm may come to her?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.023
Or us.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.422
Tara.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.214
You can feel my influence,
can't you, Tara?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.511
Don't fight it.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.886
Let me in, Tara.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.680
Let me in.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.737
Thank you, Sam.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.736
Thank you for giving us all this gift...

33:15.911 --> 33:18.152
...so that he can come into the world.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.577
Pretty.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.250
Silence!

33:34.054 --> 33:38.889
It is me, the God Who Comes.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.890
I have come, and now I am here.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.556
You're the God Who Comes?

33:50.820 --> 33:51.946
Horns.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.775
-Horns. You need horns.
-Well, go get them.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.318
Sam Merlotte, you are my offering.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.032
Yeah.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.453
People, your work here is done. Go home.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.917
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.754
He is the best offering ever.

34:11.925 --> 34:15.417
You will all have great weather...

34:16.179 --> 34:17.294
...and good crops.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.802
-Now leave.
-Bullshit. God has horns.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.762
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.985
Is that really god?

34:32.112 --> 34:34.023
Lord.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.653
Lord.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.362
Smite me.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.908
-What's he saying? I can't hear in this thing.
-I don't know.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.870
Smite me, lord.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.458
I don't even know
what you're saying, man.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.961
Smite me, motherfucker.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.179
I smite thee, Sam Merlotte!

35:02.017 --> 35:06.056
Die!

35:11.026 --> 35:12.812
Where'd he go?

35:14.112 --> 35:18.230
-What the fuck just happened?
-I got no fucking idea.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.700
There. Happy? Well?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.868
Yeah.

35:33.381 --> 35:37.420
Tell your leader
I am very pleased with my offering.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.050
Thank you, God.

35:39.471 --> 35:43.180
You are welcome. You're all blessed.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.304
Now, go!

35:48.855 --> 35:51.597
Squad, report to Maryann for debriefing.

35:52.233 --> 35:56.101
Anybody who wants to debrief me
can do so right now.

36:10.835 --> 36:14.748
-What the hell happened to Sam?
-I don't know, man. I don't know.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.129
I'll explain later.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.714
Just help me put these fucking flares out
before they start a fire.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.227
That's the last drink I'll ever take.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.606
Tara, let Sookie in.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.941
It's not working.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.276
Tara, you are safe here.

36:46.663 --> 36:50.281
-You have to do exactly as I say.
-I am not your fucking slave girl.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.291
If there was a time to listen
to a white man, this would be it.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.668
Jesus, please, Jesus.

36:56.297 --> 36:58.128
Let Sookie in.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.634
Sookie, now.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.135
Goddamn.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.082
Oh, my God.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.628
I'm crazy.

37:46.973 --> 37:50.056
-I'm really crazy.
-No.

37:50.518 --> 37:54.010
No. It wasn't you.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.513
It's not you.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.734
Mama.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.031
I'm sorr—-

38:07.202 --> 38:10.945
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mama.
-I knew it wasn't you, baby girl.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.080
-Mama.
-I knew it wasn't you.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.333
Thank you.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.752
I need some air.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.239
Eggs. I gotta go get Eggs.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.317
No.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.329
I've known Tara my whole life...

38:58.503 --> 39:02.997
...and every trace of her was gone,
replaced.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.416
Here I thought vampires were
the only ones who could hypnotize people.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.506
No offense, Sookie,
but humans are shockingly susceptible...

39:09.681 --> 39:12.639
...to just about every form
of thought manipulation.

39:12.809 --> 39:16.848
It's all coming from Maryann. All of it.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.564
They eat people's hearts.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.066
But she wants more.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.604
She wants their souls.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.613
-And that chant.
-Chant?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.111
Bacchus.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.964
Bill?

39:44.132 --> 39:48.796
I've seen that look on your face before,
and I don't like it.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.800
I read about some ancient creatures
many years ago.

39:57.687 --> 40:00.770
But I always assumed it was just a myth.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.526
But I believe Maryann might be one.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.444
What is she?

40:08.615 --> 40:10.901
And more importantly...

40:11.659 --> 40:12.944
...how do we kill her?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.485
I do not know how to defeat her.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.038
But I know one vampire who might.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.453
Might.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.624
But if I'm gonna make it by daylight,
I must leave now.

40:26.341 --> 40:27.751
Let's go.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.133
I must do this alone.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.840
But I'll be back by morning.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.674
And Jason and Sam,
Tara and Lafayette...

40:39.771 --> 40:41.511
...you can do more good for them here.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.767
You're right.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.150
I left everybody before,
and look what happened.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.061
Can you do...?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.732
Whatever it was
that you did to Maryann...

40:53.910 --> 40:55.195
...can you do that again?

40:56.537 --> 40:58.368
I don't know.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.531
I don't even know what it was that I did.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.377
All right.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.661
You keep your friends safe.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.585
And by all means,
you stay away from your home.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.502
Promise me.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.050
Promise.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.782
But I never get to go to the party.

41:35.952 --> 41:39.740
You know how many invitations I've passed
up to stay home with my crybaby son?

41:39.914 --> 41:42.121
You always go
and always drag me along with you.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.122
Oh, you selfish little shit.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.579
You know what?
Spew as much venom as you want.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.837
-I'm not letting you get near Merlotte's.
-You could come with me.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.796
Maybe meet a nice girl
instead of that devil slut.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.962
-I'm getting real tired of this shit.
-Treat Jess with respect...

41:57.140 --> 42:00.098
...or I'm gonna lock your ass up
until Vampire Bill gets home.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.854
Because you're dipping your penguin dick
in that vampire tramp?

42:07.025 --> 42:10.563
You are cut from the same cloth
as your daddy.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.728
You are both half-men.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.112
-Miss Fortenberry--
-Just calm down.

42:15.283 --> 42:18.025
A half-man and a dead whore.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.194
-Who else would have either of you?
-Jess, don't.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.785
Look, lady, you have no idea
how little control I have over my actions.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.291
You also do not know
that I haven't eaten in days.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.952
Seriously?

42:29.464 --> 42:30.453
Wait.

42:31.924 --> 42:35.052
Now, you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't drain you dry.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.631
I don't gotta give you nothing.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.011
Fuck,no!

42:41.392 --> 42:45.226
Welcome, Mr. Compton.
The queen is expecting you.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.715
Your Majesty.
