Whoa. Was that Future-Danny?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.107
(STAMMERS) Who, him? No.

21:14.191 --> 21:17.194
Dude's always getting sucked
out of roofs by tractor beams.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.320
Did he want anything?

21:18.403 --> 21:21.490
(STAMMERS) He said
to give you this.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.700
(COOING)

21:23.784 --> 21:25.118
Good old Future-D!

21:25.202 --> 21:27.120
Always comin' correct with the hugs.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.205
Thanks, Bug.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.458
Now, let's get down
with the <i>Mad Nunchukery, </i>son!

21:33.460 --> 21:34.586
Ya-yay.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.171
NARRATOR: <i>Future-Worm!</i>
