WEBVTT

00:07.465 --> 00:08.800
[Archer] Lana.

00:08.883 --> 00:09.968
Lana.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.803
-[inhales deeply]
-Let me go ahead

00:11.886 --> 00:13.513
and save you the trouble
of shouting my name

00:13.596 --> 00:15.140
-like a shrill five-year-old...
-Shrill?

00:15.223 --> 00:18.560
...and point out that I'm a little busy
doing both our jobs.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.563
Which I'd be helping you with
if I could find the goddamn cherries.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.647
What cherries?

00:22.731 --> 00:24.482
The maraschino cherries, Lana. I--

00:24.566 --> 00:26.693
We are entering the atmosphere
of an uncharted planet

00:26.776 --> 00:29.487
at a couple thousand miles per hour
to check out a distress beacon

00:29.571 --> 00:31.823
and you're talking to me about cherries?

00:31.906 --> 00:33.742
She said. Dryly.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.703
Sorry, I didn't invent
how to make a whiskey sour, Lana.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.787
Here's an idea.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.498
Maybe try inventing
not doing that right now.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.542
God, lighten up. It's a road trip.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.753
Who goes on a road trip
without a few cocktails?

00:44.836 --> 00:47.338
-Look--
-Trick question, Lana. No one does.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.467
-This isn't--
-The time to try new things. Exactly.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.802
Especially when we're going
a thousand miles per--

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
-[thudding]
-Goddamn it.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.847
[alarm blaring]

00:55.930 --> 00:58.600
[automated voice]
<i>System failure. System failure.</i>

00:58.683 --> 01:00.018
Autopilot is out.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.394
[groans] I got it.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.565
What is happening?

01:05.648 --> 01:07.734
-Goddamn it!
-[Cyril whimpering]

01:07.817 --> 01:09.486
What the hell's going on up there?

01:09.569 --> 01:13.073
Don't look at me!
Talk to Captain Road Trip over here!

01:13.156 --> 01:15.283
What? Oh, how is this suddenly my fault?

01:16.242 --> 01:19.662
We're coming in hot! Everyone, hang on!

01:19.746 --> 01:21.581
Hey, if you happen to see
any cherries back there--

01:21.664 --> 01:22.916
Oh, God, give it a rest.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.709
You give it a rest.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.298
[all shouting]

01:32.050 --> 01:33.092
[crashes]

01:45.855 --> 01:47.273
-[Cheryl laughing]
-[coughs]

01:47.357 --> 01:48.858
Holy shitsnacks!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.944
[bottle rolling]

01:52.195 --> 01:53.238
[bottle clinks]

01:53.321 --> 01:55.573
Never mind. Found the cherries.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.536
[theme music playing]

02:36.281 --> 02:39.576
So, got some good news and some bad news.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.371
Any chance you're gonna tell us
what it is?

02:43.454 --> 02:45.915
Oh, right.
The bad news is, comms are dead,

02:45.999 --> 02:49.586
and the fuel cell's ruptured,
so we're not going anywhere anytime soon.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.713
Hang on. You mean we're frickin' stranded?

02:51.796 --> 02:55.550
[scoffs] Not stranded, dummy.
He said "soon."

02:55.633 --> 02:57.260
Though, I technically meant ever.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.428
Then, what's the good news?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.847
Hmm. Guess it was mostly just bad news.

03:00.930 --> 03:01.973
Dammit, Krieger!

03:02.056 --> 03:04.517
God, relax. He said "mostly."

03:04.601 --> 03:07.854
So, completely inoperable.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.439
Um, what are you doing?

03:09.522 --> 03:12.525
Oh, uh, since our insurance claims
keep getting denied,

03:12.609 --> 03:15.320
Ms. Archer has put me
in charge of the paperwork.

03:15.403 --> 03:19.115
Cause of accident:
barely functional alcoholism.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.575
-Hey!
-All right, listen up.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.786
Let's salvage what we can from the shuttle
and find the distress beacon.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.206
It's probably a downed ship,
so maybe there's a fuel cell we can use.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.460
Way ahead of you...
on the "salvage what you can" part.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.045
Unbelievable.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.881
[snickers] Right? What are the chances
lemons would survive the--

03:34.964 --> 03:37.425
Can you please focus?

03:37.508 --> 03:41.179
Why? Mother's probably putting together
a rescue plan as we speak.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.680
-[lounge music playing]
-[computer beeping]

03:42.764 --> 03:46.893
Mm, should probably check on
why their comms are down.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.647
Meh, feels like it can wait.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.942
[sighs] Everything can wait.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.864
[smacks lips, sighs]
Speaking of, anybody want in on this?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.157
I'm about to make another batch.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.867
-Seriously?
-Road trip.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.286
Which we may be on forever
if we're stranded here.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.538
Oh, take it easy, Lana. It'll be fine.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.792
And this blithe optimism is based on what,
exactly?

04:10.875 --> 04:13.211
Because this is me we're talking about.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.545
Wildly reassuring.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.882
Trust me on this.
I have mastered the art of blind luck.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.886
No offense to your blind luck,
but it might be nice to have a plan B.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.222
Why? Seriously, do you have any idea

04:24.305 --> 04:26.975
how many times I should have
literally died in the last year?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.893
-Wow me.
-Krieger, tell her.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.645
Including that thing last week?

04:30.728 --> 04:32.814
Hey, this is totally safe, right?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.650
-Technically?
-As in actually, Krieger.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.319
Kind of feels like probably.
To both of those.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.404
[Archer] Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

04:40.154 --> 04:41.781
-Then, nine.
-Boosh.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.157
Please tell me there's a point.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.494
Point is, if you hit pause
on your whole angry negativity thing...

04:46.577 --> 04:47.745
Angry what?

04:47.829 --> 04:51.541
...for, like, one second,
you'd notice we always end up fine.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.626
[creature snarling]

04:59.257 --> 05:01.426
Though we may be pushing our luck
at this point.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.636
[crunching ice]

05:03.720 --> 05:08.933
[panting] Christ on a cracker.
Is this whole frickin' planet uphill?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.852
[gasps] Jesus, is that a thing?

05:10.935 --> 05:13.646
At least it means we're not
totally lost going in circles.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.316
-Though not feeling entirely un-lost.
-[beeping]

05:16.399 --> 05:19.652
We're not lost, idiots.
I know how to work the whatchamahickey.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.031
Really? Because "whatchamahickey"
doesn't inspire tons of confidence.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.699
It's technically a whatchamacallit.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.993
Or am I being too negative?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.037
-When are you not?
-All the time, jackass!

05:29.120 --> 05:30.872
Oh, and there's the angry part.

05:30.955 --> 05:31.956
-Look--
-Face it, Lana.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.833
Angry's basically your default setting.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.835
-Says who?
-Besides everybody?

05:35.918 --> 05:37.336
Well, not everybody.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.421
Thank you.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.465
[chuckling]
Just the people who've actually met you.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.258
Yeah, possibly a few others.

05:42.341 --> 05:45.386
Hey, assholes.
I'm not, like, perpetually angry!

05:45.470 --> 05:47.263
[laughs] Really?

05:47.346 --> 05:48.347
Yes, really.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.432
Scale of one to ten, Lana,

05:49.515 --> 05:51.601
how happy would you say you are
in general?

05:51.684 --> 05:52.935
Oh, easily a six.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.021
A six? Then what's a seven,

05:55.104 --> 05:57.023
"Yay, I've got tons of cancer"?

05:57.106 --> 05:58.107
Like you're any better.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.401
Seriously? I'm always a total nine.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.527
[scoffs] Please.

06:01.611 --> 06:06.115
I'm buoyant, Lana, bordering on bubbly.
Listen to how I talk. There's a tone.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.493
-A tone?
-Yes, Lana, a tone.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.079
Notice how my sentences go up at the end?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.372
Oh, yeah, you mean like,
"Shut the hell up?"

06:13.456 --> 06:15.750
-[device beeping]
-Exa-- Dammit. Ow!

06:15.833 --> 06:18.377
Ha! Now, I'm a seven, by the way.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.463
[creature snarling]

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
And now, I'm a two.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.886
[footsteps stomping]

06:26.969 --> 06:29.222
So which part of
the blind luck plan is this?

06:29.305 --> 06:31.140
Um, I think this is the part where you--

06:31.224 --> 06:32.975
[screaming] Shit!

06:33.559 --> 06:36.312
Finally! Some freaking downhill.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.396
[thud]

06:37.480 --> 06:39.857
[rapid beeping]

06:39.941 --> 06:42.902
Blind luck, you are my spirit animal.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.618
Holy spacesnacks. What the hell happened?

06:50.701 --> 06:52.954
Hopefully nothing
a fuel cell couldn't survive.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.997
Yeah, otherwise we're pretty much screwed.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.334
Easy, Debbie Downer. No one wants to go
to your dark place right now.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.628
-You know--
-Yeah, but she's right.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.966
We only have enough food for a few days.
Then what? We sit around and starve?

07:05.049 --> 07:08.344
[scoffs] Please, whoever survives
the culling will have plenty of food.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.055
-The what?
-Uh, the culling?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.890
You know,
where people suffocate in their sleep

07:12.974 --> 07:14.684
with gross, sweaty socks
stuffed in their mouths

07:14.767 --> 07:17.520
or get accidentally stabbed in the neck
while they pee or whatever?

07:19.021 --> 07:21.232
-What?
-The details make it weird.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.358
Just the details?

07:22.442 --> 07:26.362
Section seven,
possible post-accident injuries.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.031
Uh, that's "culling" with a C, right?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.576
Look, idiots, there's gotta be a fuel cell
around here somewhere.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.536
They're basically impossible to destroy.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.956
Unless the pilot spills a cocktail
all over the flight controls.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.625
Yeah, but what are the odds
their pilot was that kick-ass?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.170
Perhaps better than you think.

07:43.129 --> 07:47.133
-[Lana] Holy...
-[Pam] Shitsnacks.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.551
Ooh, fascinating.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.136
Now, I'm an eight.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.431
[Lana] How is this possible?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.808
[Cyril] It-- It isn't. This is insane.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.479
Obviously.
I mean, who shaves off hair like this?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.272
[laughs]

08:01.898 --> 08:02.899
Idiot.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.407
[Lana] Okay,
there's gotta be a logical explanation.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.826
Lana,
there's nothing logical about shaving--

08:13.910 --> 08:15.786
Not talking about your hair, dumbass.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.705
None of this makes any sense.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.875
Uh, ever consider the fact
we're obviously ghosts

08:20.958 --> 08:23.377
looking at our own stupid dead bodies?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.421
We're not ghosts, dick nuts.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.298
How do you-- Ow!

08:27.381 --> 08:30.510
Buy a girl a drink first. Jesus.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.179
Is anyone here
familiar with multiverse theory?

08:33.262 --> 08:34.680
How about pretend we're not?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.600
Long story short,
this may be a parallel universe,

08:37.683 --> 08:40.603
making these our doppelgangers.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.771
Doppel-what?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.898
Sort of like everyone's alter egos.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.067
[sighs] Not everyone's.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.152
Yeah. Where's yours, Krieger?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.404
Huh. Maybe doppel-Krieger survived.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.449
Yeah, and maybe he killed everybody.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.494
[chuckling nervously] Please,
why would I ever finally do that?

08:56.577 --> 08:58.287
[static crackling]

08:58.371 --> 08:59.539
What the hell?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.966
How? He's nothing like me.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.885
Got a point.
He did seem entirely non-self-absorbed.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.512
Exactly. Wait, what?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.222
And weirdly, not a dick.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.224
You're weirdly not a dick.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.309
Makes no sense.

10:01.392 --> 10:05.187
Yeah. That other Archer
was refreshingly friendly.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.189
Yeah, like what you think matters, Cyril.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.524
And we're back.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.570
And is it just me, or was that
shaved head thing super working?

10:12.653 --> 10:13.654
Totally.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.780
-Kasploosh!
-I was into it.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.241
Just sit there
and be into the non-hair-having,

10:17.325 --> 10:18.868
clearly castrated version of me

10:18.951 --> 10:21.912
while I go find a fuel cell
to get us all out of here,

10:21.996 --> 10:26.917
which, PS, is pretty much
the opposite of self-absorbed.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.841
So, how's the bubbly thing going?
Still sporting that nine?

10:34.550 --> 10:35.551
[timidly] No.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.637
[creature snarling]

10:38.554 --> 10:40.556
[footsteps stomping]

10:47.021 --> 10:50.775
Are you making any of the following claims
for emotional distress?

10:50.858 --> 10:53.235
Yes, yes, yes-- Well, these are all yes.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.904
-[metal creaking]
-[screams]

10:54.987 --> 10:57.239
[all screaming]

10:57.323 --> 10:59.825
[ship creaking]

11:00.451 --> 11:01.827
[thuds]

11:02.662 --> 11:04.580
Shit, I'm heavy.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.832
[creature snarls]

11:08.668 --> 11:10.795
[all screaming]

11:10.878 --> 11:12.004
Incoming.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.221
[roars]

11:22.556 --> 11:25.476
[muffled] So, I officially quit.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.645
And speaking of good news,

11:27.728 --> 11:31.148
I assume finding this
crammed up my ass qualified?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.234
Is that a fuel cell? Oh, thank God.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.194
Shut up, Cyril. You still don't matter.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.989
[laughs] It's funny 'cause it's true.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.866
[footsteps stomping]

11:40.950 --> 11:43.536
[Krieger] Okay,
got some good news and bad news.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.620
[snarls]

11:44.703 --> 11:47.623
Bad news is,
that thing's not going anywhere.

11:47.706 --> 11:48.916
And the good news?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.794
Mm, I swear I had something for this.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.129
-[all] Krieger!
-Great.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.297
Making us pretty much screwed.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.549
Easily a six.

11:56.632 --> 12:00.052
-Shut it.
-And let the culling begin!

12:00.136 --> 12:01.178
Okay.

12:02.304 --> 12:06.559
Maybe instead of culling each other,
we should come up with an actual plan.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.520
Like, obviously someone needs to
go out there and distract that thing

12:09.603 --> 12:11.730
while everyone else gets away.
And I vote Pam.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.816
What? Screw you, dick nuts!

12:13.899 --> 12:15.359
-What?
-Why me?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.485
Because look at you, Pam.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.029
That thing's not gonna want to eat...
that.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.450
Well, you either!
'Cause who'd want to eat a complete dick?

12:22.533 --> 12:24.118
Just gonna softball it in like that?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.370
Sorry I didn't invent appetizing, Pam.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.958
Yeah, well, I'm sorry we ended up
with the complete asshole version of you.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.295
Oh, what?
You'd rather have touchy-feely bald guy?

12:34.378 --> 12:35.379
-[overlapping chatter]
-100%.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.423
-No contest.
-Fine. Know what?

12:38.215 --> 12:39.967
[grunts] You want him?

12:41.802 --> 12:45.222
[grunts] Then come and get him!

12:45.306 --> 12:46.724
Boom. Wordplay.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.850
[roars]

12:47.933 --> 12:49.059
Now run, idiots!

12:50.519 --> 12:52.938
[creature snorting]

12:53.481 --> 12:54.607
[leaves rustling]

12:54.690 --> 12:57.151
[Lana] So, was it weird?

12:57.234 --> 12:59.487
Probably. Wait, what are we talking about?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.031
You know, watching your alter ego
get eaten by a giant lizard.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.783
Please. If that guy
was really my alter ego, Lana,

13:04.867 --> 13:07.828
he would have been something really cool
like a secret agent

13:07.912 --> 13:09.497
or a private detective or a--

13:09.580 --> 13:11.290
[rustling]

13:16.504 --> 13:20.174
Oh, my God! You guys are alive! Archer!

13:20.257 --> 13:22.092
Oh, God. Get it off.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.552
And your hair!

13:23.636 --> 13:25.930
-Right?
-It's glorious.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.515
Aw, wait a minute.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.266
Doppelganger multiverse theory?

13:29.350 --> 13:30.559
Ha-ha, exactly.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.103
And the rest of my crew's... dead?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.940
-Exactly.
-Oh, like you didn't kill them.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.776
[chuckling nervously] What?
Why would I ever do that finally?

13:38.859 --> 13:39.985
-Right?
-Besides--

13:40.069 --> 13:43.531
You know what? What do you say we take
this half-assed reunion on the road

13:43.614 --> 13:46.367
before that Tyrannosaurus whatever
shows up for seconds?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.077
-Fascinating.
-What?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.287
Our Lana had a lot of angry energy too.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.789
Ha! Hilarious.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.082
Oh, is it?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.543
And that was no Tyrannosaurus rex you saw.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.046
I mean, unless a T. rex is
capable of camouflaging itself perfectly

13:59.129 --> 14:01.131
in any surroundings with chameleon-like...

14:05.511 --> 14:07.846
Oh, shit, it's right behind me, isn't it?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.057
[snarling]

14:14.186 --> 14:18.440
So, how's that whole
blind luck thing working out?

14:18.524 --> 14:19.859
[creature snarling]

14:19.942 --> 14:21.026
[all shouting]

14:21.110 --> 14:23.112
No, me!

14:26.782 --> 14:29.952
[laughs] You tell me.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.036
[snarling]

14:36.834 --> 14:38.836
[roaring]

14:39.253 --> 14:41.338
Uh, I mean, seriously, Lana.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.841
At some point,
you really gotta ask yourself--

14:43.924 --> 14:45.009
It's not the time.

14:45.092 --> 14:49.680
If maybe the luckiest spot in the galaxy
is standing right next to me.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.224
Got a whole bunch of wedding photos
that say otherwise.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.226
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.103
[panting]

14:56.186 --> 14:57.229
We have wedding photos?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.773
Oh, yeah.
Big box of 'em labeled "Cautionary Tale,"

14:59.857 --> 15:01.859
which is what this whole thing's
gonna turn into

15:01.942 --> 15:04.111
if we can't find our way back to the ship.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.780
How the hell?

15:06.864 --> 15:10.284
I've learned not to ask.
Now, let's get the hell out of here.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.369
Wait, what are you talking about?
We can't just fly off.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.664
What? Then why have I been
lugging this thing around all this time?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.083
No. I mean we can't just leave everyone.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.002
Of course we're not, Lana.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.504
-[creature snarls]
-Assuming they get here on time.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.256
Wow, such an asshole.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.883
-What?
-Could you try

15:25.966 --> 15:30.262
not being completely consumed
with yourself for once in your life?

15:30.804 --> 15:31.847
Why?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.727
Wait, I don't want to go wandering around
a man-eating jungle,

15:36.810 --> 15:40.439
and suddenly, I'm the asshole?
How does that even work?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.528
Oh, I know.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.864
Maybe I should shave my head
and take up poetry

15:48.948 --> 15:52.701
and see how many things I can rhyme
with "soul-sucking" and--

15:53.118 --> 15:54.703
[Cyril] Lana!

15:56.497 --> 15:57.831
Lana!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.167
What are you guys doing?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.587
Well, we were hiding
from that stupid, giant lizard thingy.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.382
But now, thanks to your loud-as-shit ass--

16:06.465 --> 16:08.342
-[camouflage powers down]
-Not so much.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.260
[roars]

16:10.344 --> 16:12.054
-Holy--
-Shit.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.223
Oh, wait.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.769
Oh, what are you doing, woman?

16:18.852 --> 16:20.896
Besides pissing it off even more!

16:20.980 --> 16:23.190
And totally killing our earballs!

16:23.732 --> 16:25.526
-What?
-See?

16:25.609 --> 16:26.610
[snarling]

16:26.694 --> 16:28.362
-[Pam screams]
-[Krieger] Oh, damn it!

16:29.947 --> 16:32.032
[rumbling]

16:35.828 --> 16:37.121
[snarls]

16:37.746 --> 16:40.624
Good God! What the hell is it doing now?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.209
I don't know, moving on to plan B?

16:42.292 --> 16:44.712
Yeah, B, as in burying us alive.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.800
[roars]

16:51.927 --> 16:54.013
[roars]

16:54.096 --> 16:56.890
Okay. Who brought the dog?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.767
[snarls]

17:01.061 --> 17:02.479
-[rumbling]
-[Archer grunts]

17:02.563 --> 17:04.064
[yelling]

17:05.274 --> 17:06.358
Dammit.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.986
[all shouting]

17:10.362 --> 17:11.739
[creature snarls]

17:11.822 --> 17:12.906
[Archer screams]

17:13.574 --> 17:14.658
[groans]

17:31.091 --> 17:33.093
[creature screeching]

17:42.352 --> 17:46.190
Well, look who decided
not to be a total dick.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.692
Just couldn't leave my buddy Cyril behind.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.027
Wait, really?

17:50.110 --> 17:51.570
Of course not, idiot.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.948
And yet, you had the time
to stop and make a cocktail.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.077
God, you are just so glass-half-empty.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.954
Oh, actually, me too,
so just gonna freshen this up.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.885
[Malory] Item one.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.179
-Item what?
-Yeah, what are we even doing?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.889
It's called an agenda.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.974
-For what?
-So confused right now.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.770
I swear, you people. Item one.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.980
The insurance company
has officially deemed

18:27.064 --> 18:29.233
the <i>Seamus II</i> a total loss,

18:29.316 --> 18:33.445
so this little enterprise
may actually turn a profit this year.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.697
What are you talking about?

18:35.781 --> 18:36.782
The other crew.

18:36.865 --> 18:40.369
Hang on. I thought those were
our parallel universe doppel-bangers.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.912
Oh, for the love of--

18:41.995 --> 18:46.542
Those were clones, you idiots.
I had you people cloned in your sleep.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.336
-Why?
-To double productivity, dear.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.712
It was Krieger's idea.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.384
Oh, did I obviously forget
to mention that?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.136
-Yep.
-So wait till you see

18:57.219 --> 18:59.054
what we do to you in your sleep.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.224
Now I'm a nine.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.769
[theme music playing]
