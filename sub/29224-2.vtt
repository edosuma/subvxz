[theme music playing]

00:29.696 --> 00:31.614
[jarring music playing]

00:31.698 --> 00:32.949
[Bryce] <i> Just shut the fuck up.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.367
[Zach] <i>Hold on, Bryce.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:35.891
<i>- </i> [Bryce] <i>Remember?</i>
- [Zach] <i>Bryce...</i>

00:35.952 --> 00:37.312
[Tyler] <i>We could have done better.</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:40.498
[gasping]

00:45.712 --> 00:47.088
You were shouting.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.674
Thought the nightmares went away?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.468
They're back.

00:53.845 --> 00:54.845
Tyler again?

00:57.807 --> 00:59.601
I don't know. I don't really remember.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.482
[Ani] <i> Everyone's a liar.</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:14.074
I made you chapati and tea.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.702
Since when do you clean for them, too?

01:17.869 --> 01:18.745
[shushing in Swahili]

01:18.828 --> 01:21.247
At times like this things get tougher.
Let it go.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.958
[Ani] <i>If you're breathing, you're a liar.</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:26.877
Has...

01:27.337 --> 01:29.005
Nora told you more about...

01:29.756 --> 01:31.966
- Any news?
- Amorowat!

01:35.804 --> 01:38.389
Mum, you're going to give yourself
a heart attack.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.559
I'm skipping study club tonight
to help out.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.686
I thought you had Mathletes on Tuesdays.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.482
Yes. Sorry, my mind. Mathletes.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.859
- I'll cancel it.
- Amorowat.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.112
You do not belong to the chaos here.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.115
Your only job is
to focus on your school work,

01:55.532 --> 01:59.786
rack up all the scholarships you can
and get into a top college. Period.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.039
- I just want to help out.
- You don't. You're nosy.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.582
I know you.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.461
Keep out of these people's mess.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.673
Promise me.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.007
Yes, Mummy.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.927
I promise.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.389
[Ani ] <i>I'm a liar. No question.</i>

02:21.766 --> 02:23.184
The truth can be dangerous.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.228
Lies are easier.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.314
Until they aren't anymore.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.361
[Ani] <i>Zach Dempsey lied
about what happened at Homecoming.</i>

02:34.195 --> 02:38.116
[man] Mrs. Walker, it's still possible
that Bryce just left of his own accord.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.911
He hasn't touched his bank accounts
or his credit card since Friday.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.288
His phone goes to voicemail.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.040
- Does he usually take your calls?
- I'm sorry?

02:46.124 --> 02:47.625
Maybe you and Bryce had been arguing?

02:47.917 --> 02:50.420
Was... was he happy at home?

02:50.795 --> 02:53.006
- Was he happy?
- I mean no offense, ma'am.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.134
Clay Jensen was lying to you all.

02:56.926 --> 02:57.927
He knows something.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.180
Something happened
at that high school homecoming.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.056
[Sheriff]
It seems like a whole lot happened,

03:02.140 --> 03:04.017
but until we know something specific,

03:04.517 --> 03:05.977
we can't bring him in again.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.063
Well, then talk to his friend. Tony.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.857
They both had issues with my son.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.540
[Sheriff] With all due respect, ma'am,
they weren't the only ones.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.989
Clay Jensen, Sheriff.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.451
There's a history there and you know it.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.996
[Ani] <i>Clay told me about Zach,</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:27.999
<i>but I never told Clay
what I heard about him.</i>

03:30.793 --> 03:31.920
Like I told you,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.255
I didn't know Clay that well.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.885
[Ani] <i> Though I know he was preoccupied</i>

03:39.427 --> 03:41.012
<i>with Bryce having gone missing.</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:44.724
Clay. Hey, do you have some time
today to talk...

03:45.683 --> 03:46.683
about...

03:47.644 --> 03:48.644
all of it?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.231
Sure, um...

03:52.065 --> 03:53.107
Maybe later?

03:54.192 --> 03:56.903
Don't you have Dr. Singh today?

03:57.195 --> 03:58.947
So, you can talk to her.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.866
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
I was just... I was, um...

04:02.492 --> 04:04.577
I was hoping that you and me could talk.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.082
It's just it's kind of important.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.293
Yeah, totally. Maybe at lunch?

04:13.294 --> 04:14.294
Sure.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.177
[Ani] <i> Clay was worried for himself,</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:24.555
<i>where he usually was worried
about his friends.</i>

04:26.766 --> 04:28.768
[bell ringing]

04:31.854 --> 04:32.854
How'd you sleep?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.525
Better, I guess.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.529
Uh, Alex stayed with you?
Tony gave you guys a ride?

04:39.779 --> 04:40.779
Mm-hmm.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.281
Awesome.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.492
Awesome. So...

04:46.619 --> 04:47.619
Hey,

04:47.829 --> 04:50.832
how about making an appointment
to talk to Dr. Singh?

04:52.959 --> 04:53.959
Why?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.505
You know,
just someone to talk things through with,

04:58.047 --> 04:59.048
who can help.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.717
But I have you guys.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.303
You do. You definitely do.
[stammers] It's just...

05:04.846 --> 05:07.015
maybe she can help in ways
that we can't.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.395
[Clay] I set up a schedule.
Who picks him up in the morning,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.314
who takes him between what classes,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.441
after school, nightly check-ins.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.401
If we spread it around, it's not that bad.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.862
I'll text you the URL.
It's password protected.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.073
There's, like, the insanity
of us doing this at all,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.160
and then there's the insanity of,
"Oh, my God, you built a website."

05:27.869 --> 05:31.289
I didn't build it per se,
it's really just storage space.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.334
[Alex] That's a lot of coordination.
My brain injury hurts.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.253
- How long do we have to do this?
- Until he gets better.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.006
So... forever.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.382
People do get better.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.427
They do.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.804
I guess we get to summer
and see how he is.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.016
And maybe senior year it'll all be fine.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.647
[Ani] It wasn't even a deputy,
it was the actual sheriff.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.316
She wants him to go after you

05:58.399 --> 05:59.400
and Tony.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.944
And she thinks something happened
at Homecoming.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.529
I mean,

06:04.030 --> 06:05.656
if we find out where Bryce went,

06:05.740 --> 06:07.408
if we can point them in a direction...

06:07.492 --> 06:08.951
You think he just left town?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.161
Or he's hiding.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.622
Or who knows?
Maybe he assaulted another girl.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.999
Maybe he knew his luck
was about to run out.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.545
Maybe Zach knows.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.754
[Ani] <i>Zach lied.</i>

06:21.339 --> 06:23.925
<i>And Zach had a clear reason
to hurt Bryce.</i>

06:24.801 --> 06:26.677
<i>Especially after the Homecoming game.</i>

06:27.637 --> 06:28.930
So, yeah, it was Bryce.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.474
[Ani] <i> After all, violence begets violence.</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:35.061
I saw this picture
and I thought you should know, you know?

06:35.186 --> 06:36.229
Because...

06:36.729 --> 06:39.023
I mean, it looks like he did it
on purpose.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.942
In this one, it looks like

06:41.025 --> 06:43.027
you're looking at him,
but crazy night, I guess,

06:43.111 --> 06:45.696
- so you didn't see him.
- Who took these pictures?

06:46.197 --> 06:48.574
Well, everyone was taking pictures.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.953
But it probably doesn't matter.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.705
Your knee's gonna heal, right?
No harm done.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.249
No harm done?

06:56.332 --> 06:58.543
I had handwritten letters
from three different schools

06:58.626 --> 07:00.854
coming into this year,
You think they'll wanna recruit me

07:00.878 --> 07:04.424
after they hear my knee has two surgeries?
No! I'm fucking done.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.634
But you didn't know he did it?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.429
Or you didn't tell anyone?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.806
Why wouldn't you have reported him?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.519
I've been fighting with Bryce Walker
my whole fucking life.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.272
Okay? Ever since Pop Warner
in the Fifth Grade.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.396
[Zach] Now that he's gone,

07:22.358 --> 07:23.358
more than ever.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.321
[Zach] Monty, Luke, Taylor,
all those guys, they're Bryce's boys.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.866
They wanted to do things his way.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.827
I just wanted to do things better.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.872
I didn't want my time at Liberty
to be about the clubhouse and...

07:37.039 --> 07:38.541
girls getting raped, you know?

07:38.624 --> 07:39.624
It's just...

07:40.543 --> 07:41.783
I knew that we could do better.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.465
[Ani] <i> But Zach's anger at Bryce
was about more than football.</i>

07:47.592 --> 07:49.093
<i>You see, Zach had a secret.</i>

07:49.594 --> 07:52.430
[Zach] If any of those guys find out
it was Bryce that took me down...

07:53.556 --> 07:55.516
that he was the one
that took me out for good...

07:58.478 --> 07:59.478
then he wins.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.190
And I've worked so hard
to put Bryce in the past.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.067
[coach] Liberty Tigers, listen up.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.071
All right, gentlemen, let's circle round.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.491
Come on. Let's go. Now.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.287
All right, official spring workouts
begin on Monday.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.080
Before we head out for the weekend,
though,

08:18.164 --> 08:19.916
the moment y'all been waiting for.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.792
[cheering]

08:24.378 --> 08:27.632
We counted up your votes
and the coaches weighed in.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.676
Your captain for 2018...

08:31.761 --> 08:32.845
Zach Dempsey!

08:33.221 --> 08:34.554
[boy] Really?

08:35.389 --> 08:36.849
[hesitant clapping]

08:44.315 --> 08:45.775
Zach, come say a few words.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.449
Wow, this is a huge honor and,
you know, I'm gonna take this seriously.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.117
See, we've had...

08:56.577 --> 09:00.665
a certain kind of culture here
on this team at Liberty.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.543
But that's gonna change.
We're gonna change.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.086
We're going to be better.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.004
And we're going to win.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.840
So, let's go. Who are we?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.552
- Liberty!
- Tigers!

09:12.635 --> 09:13.635
Come on!

09:14.178 --> 09:15.471
- Liberty!
- Tigers!

09:15.555 --> 09:16.931
- Liberty!
- Tigers!

09:17.014 --> 09:19.058
That's right, we're taking State in '18,
am I right?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.977
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we are!

09:21.936 --> 09:24.397
[cheering]

09:28.776 --> 09:29.776
You got this.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.322
Coach? Coach, come on. I won the vote.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.407
Everyone voted for me.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.158
- This is fucking bullshit!
- Come on!

09:36.242 --> 09:39.120
No, it's bullshit and you know it.
You know the whole team voted for me.

09:39.203 --> 09:42.248
Not true. In fact, you know
it all doesn't come down to the vote.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.875
- Lots goes into choosing a captain.
- Well, y'all chose wrong.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.128
Listen to me, I get it.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.881
Okay? But Zach's your captain now
and you can choose how to respond to that.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.801
You can think about the team
or you can think about yourself.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.386
It's not fair.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.104
He'll cool off.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.313
No.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.856
No, he won't.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.649
But...

10:10.693 --> 10:11.693
[sighing] it's fine.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.463
- [sighing] Hey, Bryce.
- Zachy.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.132
Saw the Audi. Had to stop and say hi.

10:34.008 --> 10:34.925
How's Hillcrest?

10:35.009 --> 10:37.428
Oh, it's like a fucking country club.
I'm loving it.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.055
How's your team?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.181
It's coming together.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.142
Yeah, Monty says
you've got some exciting new ideas.

10:43.684 --> 10:47.229
None of them about football exactly,
but... exciting.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.982
Yeah, just trying to heal things,
you know? Do better.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.900
Better?

10:53.235 --> 10:54.236
Better than me?

10:54.945 --> 10:56.405
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do

10:56.489 --> 10:57.990
when things get tough, then?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
When you gotta be a hard-ass?
I worry, man.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.119
- You're soft.
- No need to worry.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.204
Is your mom gonna help?

11:03.287 --> 11:06.666
'Cause last I remember, she's the only one
with an actual dick in your family.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.546
- You should walk away, right now.
- You want to take a shot?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.633
I say let's do it right here.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.685
Not worth it.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.066
All that rage, man. You keep pushing it
down when you should be using it.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.151
- It's not healthy.
- I didn't ask for your advice.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.612
Nope, you're just gonna keep doing
like you do,

11:36.862 --> 11:38.864
and fucking your whole team
while you're at it.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.449
And me?

11:42.576 --> 11:45.037
I guess I'll just keep fucking
your head cheerleader.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.417
[Ani] <i>We all knew Bryce and Zach
were at odds,</i>

11:50.292 --> 11:52.586
<i>but Zach had another secret
he was keeping.</i>

11:55.715 --> 11:57.925
- Hey, number 85.
- Hey, there. What's up?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.553
Well, I just wanted to let you know
that I am assigned

12:00.636 --> 12:03.013
to be your official cheerleader
for Spring Workout.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.097
So...

12:04.849 --> 12:06.058
for luck.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.142
Lucky me.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.061
Unlucky rabbit.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.186
[Chloe laughing]

12:11.230 --> 12:12.940
[Chloe] You are my new hero.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.003
[Ani] <i>Did you know
Zach got Chloe's number</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:22.867
<i>for Bryce in the first place?</i>

12:22.950 --> 12:23.950
What?

12:25.578 --> 12:29.373
So, you're her hero,
but Bryce is still her boyfriend?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.584
Man, shut up!

12:33.544 --> 12:35.880
[Ani] <i>I think Zach always regretted
that move.</i>

12:37.882 --> 12:39.675
You and Zach Dempsey?

12:40.801 --> 12:41.801
Friends?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.220
Project partners?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.306
Secret online gamer pals?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.975
- D, none of the above.
- He's hot.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.685
But he's too hot.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.188
- I don't trust too hot.
- You don't, huh?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.356
Do you trust me?

12:54.899 --> 12:59.737
Oh, you trap me, but I escape.
Everybody trusts you.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.696
Not everybody.

13:01.739 --> 13:05.159
That's not what I see. I see the hero
that holds everything together.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.329
Why do you say that?

13:09.997 --> 13:12.958
No, it's just an observation.
I meant it as a good thing.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.004
It's a beautiful thing, to be so trusted.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.465
Well...

13:21.717 --> 13:24.220
maybe I'd like to trade it
for hot someday.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.806
Noted.

13:31.977 --> 13:32.977
[bell ringing]

13:45.574 --> 13:46.826
Look, Zach's gym bag.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.286
Always at his side.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.706
Why do athletes think
a gym bag is an accessory?

13:53.707 --> 13:55.292
The rabbit's foot, it's gone.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.049
- It was there this morning.
- He lost it maybe.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.053
No, he took it off.
Chloe gave it to him last spring.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.847
Bryce's girlfriend, Chloe.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.435
I think Chloe's at Sacred Heart,
but we don't talk anymore.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.188
But you two seemed pretty close
after Spring Fling.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.482
Yeah, friends come and go.

14:18.983 --> 14:19.983
Really?

14:20.734 --> 14:21.734
Just like that?

14:23.904 --> 14:26.907
Were Chloe and Zach ever anything?

14:27.491 --> 14:28.492
Just friends.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.662
Chloe had major Stockholm
when it came to Bryce.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.999
So, you don't think Chloe
and Zach had any secrets?

14:35.082 --> 14:36.375
I know Chloe had secrets.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.710
Like?

14:39.587 --> 14:40.587
Like...

14:41.130 --> 14:42.172
she was pregnant.

14:43.799 --> 14:44.799
By Bryce.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.765
- What the fuck did you do?
- Nothing.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.142
[stammering] What do you mean?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.144
Guess where I spent four hours last night?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.478
The Sheriff station.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.231
Standall had lots of questions
about what went on here last year

14:59.315 --> 15:00.441
before Brycey left.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.941
What'd you tell him?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.319
I swear, nothing.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.236
Good...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.240
'cause I'd hate to have to teach you
the same lesson twice.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.371
[Ani] <i>Everybody at Liberty had secrets
they had to protect.</i>

15:15.039 --> 15:16.123
[panicked breathing]

15:23.714 --> 15:25.716
[water running]

15:26.759 --> 15:29.053
[Ani] <i>Secrets bring more secrets,</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:31.680
<i>and violence, more violence.</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:32.932
Leave Tyler alone.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.392
- Or what?
- Or I'll hurt you.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.519
[laughs mockingly]

15:38.228 --> 15:40.397
Haven't we done this already, Standall?

15:40.856 --> 15:43.400
What are you going to do?
You gonna run to daddy?

15:43.817 --> 15:45.402
No, I can take care of myself.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.404
Why do you fucking care about Tyler?

15:47.488 --> 15:48.656
Oh, wait...

15:48.739 --> 15:50.115
Are you actually fucking?

15:59.833 --> 16:02.711
If you speak to him again,
I'll open you up and watch you bleed.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.256
- You're a crazy motherfucker.
- Yeah.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.383
So leave.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.770
It seems like you've had a rough day.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.398
Those happen, don't they?

16:26.402 --> 16:29.446
Perhaps we should focus on the progress
you've made this year, right?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.240
It's real, we've both seen it.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.492
But there'll still be bad days.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.035
What if they're all bad days?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.871
But they're not, are they?
Haven't we seen that?

16:41.041 --> 16:42.626
- Maybe they're going to be.
- No.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.172
Change, especially positive change,
happens so slowly

16:47.256 --> 16:48.924
it can feel it's not happening at all.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.719
That could well be
what you're feeling today,

16:52.344 --> 16:55.014
but change does happen over time.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.767
There'll come a day you'll look back
and you'll see it clearly.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.519
You don't have to believe it now.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.439
I can hold on to the hope for both of us.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.203
[car door closing]

17:19.663 --> 17:23.416
Morning, Sheriff. You got something
the boys in the county garage can't fix?

17:24.585 --> 17:25.919
Shouldn't you be in school, son?

17:27.838 --> 17:30.382
My future is here, sir, so...

17:31.300 --> 17:32.301
How can I help you?

17:33.302 --> 17:35.179
I need to ask you about Bryce Walker.

17:35.679 --> 17:36.679
I see.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.767
Are you aware he's been missing
since Friday night?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.226
I've heard some talk, yeah.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.979
You've had some run-ins with him
in the past.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.189
I haven't, actually.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.025
Bryce and I have always been very...
um, friendly.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.861
- But you're not friends?
- I don't have many friends.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.530
- I find that hard to believe.
- I have high standards.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.157
And Bryce doesn't meet them?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.744
Sir, with all due respect,

17:59.620 --> 18:01.955
I haven't seen Bryce in months.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.459
So, why are you talking to me about him?

18:06.543 --> 18:07.544
Well, come on, son.

18:07.628 --> 18:11.090
You're a convicted felon with two strikes
who's missed 22 days of school.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.926
You're exactly the kind of person
I should be talking to.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.593
Fair enough.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.348
Were you at the homecoming game?

18:19.973 --> 18:20.974
I was.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.310
- Were you part of that fight?
- I was not.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.728
Can anyone confirm that?

18:25.521 --> 18:26.730
I was with my boyfriend.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.652
Tony...

18:34.613 --> 18:36.156
I really wish you'd go to school.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.701
Every kid should graduate.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.209
[chatting and laughing]

18:51.338 --> 18:52.506
Chloe.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.135
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right. Bye.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.891
Clay, what are you doing here?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.060
Did you hear about Bryce?

19:06.019 --> 19:07.688
What? What about him?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.648
Well, he's missing.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.528
I haven't heard,
but we broke up, like, months ago.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.447
- [Chloe] So...
- Do you have a minute to talk?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.449
No, I really don't.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.701
Sorry.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
Did you ever tell him?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.083
That you were pregnant.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.963
Not here, okay?

19:33.630 --> 19:36.133
[Ani] <i>Chloe had a secret
that led right to Bryce.</i>

19:39.845 --> 19:40.888
Did you tell Bryce?

19:43.307 --> 19:44.307
No.

19:44.933 --> 19:45.933
I...

19:47.311 --> 19:48.311
No.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.816
Look, Clay, I know what you think...

19:53.775 --> 19:54.775
but...

19:55.611 --> 19:57.529
I really felt like I loved him.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.421
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.007
It's good to see you.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.301
It's been, what, like...

20:20.219 --> 20:21.219
over a week?

20:21.595 --> 20:24.598
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I've just been really busy.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.350
No, things haven't been right between us.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.685
Something's changed.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.563
- No, that's...
- I'm losing you.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.777
Chloe, we've never talked
about the trial...

20:38.528 --> 20:39.738
about the Polaroid.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.574
Yeah, 'cause all that's over.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.659
But is it, though?

20:44.785 --> 20:45.994
Is it over for you?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.083
Because I feel like it isn't.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.380
I don't know what you want me to say.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.302
- You told me you loved me.
- I do.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.680
I do more than anything.

21:06.723 --> 21:07.975
Chloe, I fucked up.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.147
[stammers] I'm fucked up.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.318
I betrayed your trust.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.282
I gave you every reason to destroy me.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.743
But when you had your chance on the stand,
you didn't.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.540
I told the truth.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.168
You lied.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.752
For me.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.719
I think you believed I could change.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.432
And that's why you went to Spring Fling
with me.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.601
That's why you stuck by my side
when my parents split.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.148
I want to change, Chloe.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.192
I want to be better for you.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.989
Just please don't give up on me now.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.500
And now I'd like to introduce
our next candidate for Liberty president,

22:15.584 --> 22:17.127
Jessica Davis.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.388
My name is Jessica Davis.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.351
I'm running for president
because I want change.

22:33.477 --> 22:37.481
I don't mean better dances
or new cheer uniforms...

22:37.606 --> 22:38.606
[boy] Sexy!

22:39.649 --> 22:41.193
- [boy] Yeah!
- [girl] Seriously?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.028
[crowd murmuring]

22:44.029 --> 22:49.034
...new cheer uniforms or healthy choices
in the vending machines.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.036
I mean real change.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.536
[Monty] Bitch!

22:55.248 --> 22:56.249
[boy] Oh, shit!

22:56.375 --> 22:57.375
You know what?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.127
Fuck you, Monty!

22:59.211 --> 23:01.254
[laughing and heckling]

23:01.546 --> 23:03.673
Fuck all of you jocks.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.509
- [boy] Ouch!
- [clapping]

23:05.592 --> 23:06.592
[murmuring]

23:07.135 --> 23:08.136
[boy] Seriously!

23:12.682 --> 23:13.934
I was raped

23:14.518 --> 23:18.146
by the king of the school
and I stayed silent.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.067
I protected the jock
who raped me because...

23:22.859 --> 23:23.859
I don't know.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.697
Because I thought it would hurt more
to speak up...

23:28.907 --> 23:31.618
because I thought
it would ruin my reputation.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.037
But I am no longer staying quiet.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.496
No more.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.212
So, here's my promise.

23:42.796 --> 23:46.007
If you elect me,
I will take down the jocks at this school.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.802
- [girl] Yeah!
- Put an end to their bullshit.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.721
I will not tolerate
the ones who protect them,

23:51.805 --> 23:55.725
and I will demand that
their victims no longer remain silent.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.643
[girl] Go, Jessica!

23:56.726 --> 23:59.688
Because their silence destroys us all.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.899
[cheering]

24:12.242 --> 24:13.869
[Ani] <i>Zach hides his pain well,</i>

24:15.120 --> 24:17.205
<i>which is why he saw Chloe's so clearly.</i>

24:21.751 --> 24:24.880
<i>And why he wanted to do what he could
to make hers go away.</i>

24:28.884 --> 24:29.885
[Chloe sniffs]

24:30.927 --> 24:31.927
Hey.

24:34.431 --> 24:35.432
Are you okay?

24:38.727 --> 24:39.727
No.

24:42.439 --> 24:45.442
I don't think anyone knew
what Jessica was going to say.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.361
- I mean...
- Zach, I'm pregnant.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.991
Oh, shit, Chloe. God, are...

24:54.618 --> 24:55.744
Are you okay?

24:56.870 --> 24:57.871
I don't know.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.165
Yeah...

25:02.417 --> 25:03.960
["Tired" playing]

25:04.044 --> 25:06.171
No. I don't know what to do.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.133
Does Bryce know?

25:10.634 --> 25:11.634
No.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.639
And I'm not going to tell him.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.601
Jess, she knows, but...

25:21.144 --> 25:23.522
she lost patience with me over Bryce.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.269
So what are you going to do?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.364
I have no idea.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.128
[Ani] <i> It's impossible to know everything
that went through Chloe's mind,</i>

25:47.671 --> 25:49.172
<i>but, let me just say,</i>

25:50.215 --> 25:51.424
<i>I can imagine.</i>

25:54.511 --> 25:55.511
Chloe?

25:55.637 --> 25:56.638
- [Chloe] Hi.
- Hi.

25:59.599 --> 26:02.602
Ultrasound looks good.
Exam went well.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.153
So, why don't you tell me
why you're here today, love?

26:12.821 --> 26:15.532
Um... I think I need to get an abortion.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.702
But I can't afford it.

26:18.785 --> 26:22.038
So, I heard there were, um, programs.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.334
There are. We have access to a lot
of funds that aid expectant mothers.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.920
Let me show you some literature.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.804
California makes it easier
than most states to end a baby's life.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.265
No parental consent needed even.

26:40.765 --> 26:45.562
So, we want to make sure that mothers
understand the choice they're facing.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.857
Wait, you...

26:49.733 --> 26:51.735
You don't provide, or you're not a...

26:51.818 --> 26:54.070
We're a counseling
and resource service, dear.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.198
We're here to help you
make the right choice

26:57.907 --> 26:59.993
and give you as much support
as you need.

27:00.744 --> 27:04.706
[voice fading] You and your baby can go on
to have full and wonderful lives.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.000
[Zach] <i>I'm so sorry
that happened to you, Chloe.</i>

27:07.626 --> 27:09.085
I can't even...

27:10.337 --> 27:11.463
imagine that.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.970
- Do you think I'd be a good mother?
- I think you'd be an amazing mother.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.973
Chloe, if that's what you want to do,

27:23.058 --> 27:24.059
I'll help you.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.060
We could...

27:26.436 --> 27:27.812
tell everyone that it's mine.

27:28.688 --> 27:29.688
Um...

27:30.190 --> 27:31.190
Zach...

27:31.983 --> 27:32.983
think about that.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.321
No, I know. I mean...

27:38.031 --> 27:39.199
I'll raise it with you.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.741
I'll help.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.703
What, and you'd just give up football?

27:44.871 --> 27:46.790
And I give up cheerleading. I...

27:47.791 --> 27:52.087
I couldn't go away to college,
couldn't go full time.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.840
- Right.
- But, you know, I...

27:56.841 --> 27:59.052
don't ever want to be a cheerleader again.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.557
And I don't want to be a mom.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.352
Not now.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.271
Maybe not ever, just...

28:12.440 --> 28:14.150
Maybe someday, just not now.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.652
[Chloe sighing]

28:16.986 --> 28:18.071
Okay.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.033
- You think that's bad?
- No.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.828
No, uh-uh. No.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.620
I think it's right.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.542
You'd say that to whatever I decided.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.917
Yes, I would.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.465
[sighs]

28:38.591 --> 28:40.510
So, do you know how far along you are?

28:40.969 --> 28:41.969
Um...

28:42.137 --> 28:43.221
about eight weeks.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.475
Can you explain to me the circumstances
around this pregnancy?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.061
Um, I...

28:51.938 --> 28:52.939
had sex

28:53.648 --> 28:54.941
with my boyfriend.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.109
And...

28:57.777 --> 29:00.363
I was on the pill
but I'd forgotten a couple of days.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.116
Okay, and your boyfriend
didn't wear a condom?

29:03.658 --> 29:06.161
He's not my boyfriend. And no.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.372
Okay.
I'm going to explain the procedure to you,

29:09.456 --> 29:13.126
and then we'll go over some paperwork
and you will come back Saturday morning.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.627
When you return on Saturday,

29:14.711 --> 29:18.590
we will take your blood pressure
and administer a very mild sedative.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.592
Okay? It will help relax you.

29:20.967 --> 29:25.013
The doctor will come in and insert
a very small tube into your uterus.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.557
It is connected to a suction device.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.811
That suction device will dislodge
and remove the uterine content.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.525
[sniffing]

30:17.190 --> 30:19.067
[Ani] <i>Chloe kept a secret from Bryce.</i>

30:21.152 --> 30:23.196
<i>Although his mother had seemed to guess.</i>

30:25.532 --> 30:27.283
I apologize for my son.

30:28.284 --> 30:30.119
Sounds like Hillcrest is...

30:31.079 --> 30:32.079
challenging.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.083
Well, we'd like to think so.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.102
- [clattering]
- [Ani's mum] Mr. Chatham, please.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.254
- [glass shattering]
- [Ani's mum] Please calm down.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.592
My father doesn't like taking his meds.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.970
He says they cloud his mind.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.054
I'm sorry.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.976
Well, it's a mind already clouded
with old age and bitterness...

30:53.852 --> 30:57.021
and what turns out to be
a fairly virulent strain of racism

30:57.105 --> 30:58.898
that he no longer sees the need to filter.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.653
I bet he was a really nice man
before he got sick.

31:03.945 --> 31:04.946
He wasn't.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.448
But you're sweet to say so.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.536
I'm sorry to be blunt, Chloe,

31:12.036 --> 31:14.038
but I've lost the capacity to lie.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.625
- I understand.
- Do you?

31:19.043 --> 31:21.296
Men are cruel to prove they're not weak,

31:22.255 --> 31:23.965
but they doth protest too much.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
I was raised by a cruel man,

31:27.427 --> 31:29.846
and I escaped him by marrying another.

31:31.973 --> 31:36.603
The only difference was Dad used his fist
and Barry used silence.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.189
And neither of them
should have been fathers.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.909
My son is no different, Chloe.

31:52.952 --> 31:53.953
In fact...

31:55.038 --> 31:56.706
I think he may be worse.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.759
[man] Hey. Hey, stop right there!

32:10.303 --> 32:11.971
[man 2] Think about what you're doing!

32:12.055 --> 32:13.681
[man 1]...pray for you and your baby!

32:16.684 --> 32:18.603
- It has a heartbeat!
- Hi.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.024
- Let's walk you past the crazies, huh?
- Thank you.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.318
Are they always here?

32:25.944 --> 32:26.944
Yeah.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.571
Sometimes it's just them,

32:28.655 --> 32:31.491
and sometimes
they bring ten or 15 friends.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.702
- This is hard enough.
- Well, it should be hard.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.912
Killing is a sin.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.039
But it's not too late.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.960
This is the moment where you decide
the fate of two souls. Choose wisely,

32:42.043 --> 32:43.252
or you'll regret this day

32:43.336 --> 32:46.089
- until you die. Take this...
- That's enough. Back off.

32:46.589 --> 32:47.589
[shocked gasp]

32:47.632 --> 32:50.635
- [man 1] You pray with us!
- What is wrong with you?

32:51.427 --> 32:53.012
- Please, pray with us.
- Come on.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.263
Take Jesus into your heart.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.975
[man 3] If this boy's making you do this,
he doesn't love you.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.144
- [man 1] Come pray with us.
- [man 3] Jesus loves you and your baby.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.701

Yeah.

39:08.971 --> 39:09.971
Just...

39:10.264 --> 39:12.725
maybe don't get
your psychological insights from Monty.

40:24.630 --> 40:27.299
<i>Listen, that thing we talked about,</i>

40:27.842 --> 40:28.843
<i>I'm dealing with it.</i>

40:29.468 --> 40:30.469
<i>You're all good.</i>

40:31.303 --> 40:32.680
<i>Take care of yourself, man.</i>

41:03.836 --> 41:06.130
[bleeping]

41:12.303 --> 41:14.096
[Ani] <i>Clay didn't believe Zach's story.</i>

41:14.972 --> 41:17.308
<i>He was certain Bryce knew
about the abortion...</i>

41:18.142 --> 41:21.061
<i>and took it out on Zach's knee
at Homecoming because of it.</i>

41:21.312 --> 41:24.064
If Bryce didn't know then it can't have
anything to do with anything.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.668
So you're convinced Bryce didn't know?

41:25.733 --> 41:26.859
I'm sure he didn't.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.904
How? How can you be so sure?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.238
Chloe didn't tell him.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.322
So she says.

41:32.364 --> 41:34.241
- No, I know she didn't.
- How do you know?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.244
How do you know?

41:38.829 --> 41:39.663
Clay...

41:39.747 --> 41:41.081
Did you ask him?

41:42.416 --> 41:45.377
Jesus, did you talk about Chloe,
his girlfriend?

41:45.461 --> 41:47.880
We talked about Chloe
when she broke up with him.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.363
You've been lying to me for months.

41:49.423 --> 41:52.510
No, I...
I just haven't told you everything.

41:54.929 --> 41:55.929
Right.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.809
You've been lying to me
since the first time I drove you home.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.277
You live...

42:11.153 --> 42:12.780
This is, like, an intersection.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.448
Yeah, perfect.

42:14.740 --> 42:18.202
But you told me you lived on Manor Ridge
not at the bottom of Manor Ridge.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.453
I can walk up the hill.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.497
Or I can drive you up the hill.

42:22.081 --> 42:25.417
Well, for such an A student,
you are crap at following directions.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.213
You don't want me to know
where you live.

42:29.338 --> 42:32.317
- You think I might be a stalker.
- I think you're the opposite of a stalker.

42:32.341 --> 42:35.135
That first day at lunch,
you ran away like you were ill.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.013
I didn't run, I...

42:39.348 --> 42:40.641
deftly avoided.

42:40.724 --> 42:43.352
You are not deftly avoiding right now.

42:43.435 --> 42:46.313
My situation is... complicated.

42:48.607 --> 42:50.651
I tend to thrive in complicated.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.698
It's at the top of the hill.

42:56.782 --> 42:57.950
The Chatham house.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.078
The Chatham house?

43:03.038 --> 43:04.748
Isn't that where Bryce Walker lives now?

43:04.832 --> 43:06.417
- You live...
- In the guest house.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.962
My mum is a home health care aide.

43:10.212 --> 43:11.797
She takes care of his grandfather.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.799
You have to get out of there.

43:13.882 --> 43:16.260
I can't get out of there,
it's where I live.

43:16.343 --> 43:18.512
But... do you know his story?

43:19.555 --> 43:22.182
I know enough. It's all online.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.227
It's not all online.
They don't tell you...

43:26.186 --> 43:27.521
- who he hurt.
- Look,

43:27.896 --> 43:30.941
it's not like we're friends or anything.
I don't even live in the house.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.985
It's not safe there. Okay?

43:33.068 --> 43:36.280
I'm not some pretty princess locked away
in the rich kid's house.

43:36.363 --> 43:37.573
I take care of myself.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.450
You don't know the whole story.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.911
You're going to tell me everything I need
to know and save me from the monster?

43:43.245 --> 43:44.997
I mean, I hope so.

43:45.247 --> 43:48.667
Wow, how have I survived without you
for 17 years? I just can't imagine.

43:48.751 --> 43:51.795
Thank God you're here to save me
from the wilds of Evergreen county.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.589
- Come on...
- Thanks for the ride.

43:53.672 --> 43:54.882
I'll see you at school.

43:59.845 --> 44:00.845
[Ani] <i>To Clay,</i>

44:01.263 --> 44:02.556
<i>Bryce was a monster.</i>

44:03.724 --> 44:04.892
<i>And I understood why.</i>

44:06.560 --> 44:09.688
<i>But the Bryce I saw
seemed very much broken.</i>

44:12.816 --> 44:15.402
Vodka martini, very dry, please.

44:16.862 --> 44:18.614
Is that for you to drink with your mother?

44:18.697 --> 44:19.698
Mmm, funny.

44:21.617 --> 44:22.617
Didn't know you drink.

44:23.243 --> 44:27.247
Yeah, I only recently started again.
I stopped for a while.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.709
Condition of my probation.

44:32.252 --> 44:35.923
Thought I'd see if I could make it stick
but it's hard to fight genetics.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.304
You know, right?

44:43.639 --> 44:45.349
About my probation.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.393
Yeah, basically.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.520
And why I'm at fucking Hillcrest now.

44:50.729 --> 44:51.814
Not great, is it?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.149
[sighs]

44:55.359 --> 44:56.359
It's fine.

44:57.861 --> 44:58.862
It's what I deserve.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.581
I knew he was having a hard time
at his new school.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.167
He told me all about it.

45:14.336 --> 45:15.754
[Ani] <i>Was it one of those boys?</i>

45:16.338 --> 45:17.548
[boy] Walker, get over here.

45:17.631 --> 45:20.008
[Ani] <i>One of those other young men
of great privilege?</i>

45:22.094 --> 45:23.554
- Magic gummy?
- [Bryce laughs]

45:24.054 --> 45:25.848
I don't partake, but thanks.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.975
Give it a few weeks. You'll need it.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.728
- [Dean] You've been here what, a month?
- Mm-hmm.

45:30.811 --> 45:31.729
How's the adjustment?

45:31.812 --> 45:33.522
Hillcrest sure isn't Liberty.

45:34.565 --> 45:38.026
No, it's not.
And honestly, man, I'm loving it here.

45:38.110 --> 45:41.155
- Yeah. The downside, no girls.
- [Bryce] I guess.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.658
No distractions from playing ball.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.594
- You got that right.
- [Dean] Don't worry, man.

45:46.618 --> 45:50.330
We got plenty of girls over
at Claremont Prep when it's time to party.

45:50.539 --> 45:52.040
Good girls, if you know what I mean.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.125
Yeah, totally.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.376
You got a girlfriend?

45:54.460 --> 45:56.211
I'm focusing on my game right now.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.965
Come on, man, a guy like you?
What are you into? I can hook it up.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.386
- I'm good.
- [Dean] Dude, those Claremont girls,

46:02.468 --> 46:05.554
they're under strict instruction
to lock it down with one of us.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.055
Family connections, right?

46:07.139 --> 46:09.558
- I got a girl there.
- So you're locked down then?

46:09.641 --> 46:10.642
[laughs]

46:11.143 --> 46:12.143
No.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.604
But I'm having a good time.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.816
I can't say the same for her,
but it's not really my problem, is it?

46:17.900 --> 46:20.235
I mean, it's hard for a guy to know.

46:20.736 --> 46:21.862
[laughter]

46:22.196 --> 46:23.196
I feel you, brother.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.657
- But will you feel her?
- What do you mean?

46:25.741 --> 46:28.660
I mean when she passes out at a party
and you fucking rape her.

46:30.871 --> 46:33.373
- [man] Dude...
- Get the fuck out of here.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.965
[Ani] <i>Did they hate him so much</i>

46:42.508 --> 46:43.842
<i>that they might hurt him?</i>

46:49.515 --> 46:51.266
[Dean] Walker! Hey, you okay?

46:51.475 --> 46:52.476
Yeah, fine.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.746
Hey, listen. You're a great target
over the middle, man.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.564
I'm sorry about Carter, he just,
he gets excited, you know?

46:57.648 --> 47:00.859
Yeah, or he's too stupid
to know what "no contact" means.

47:01.109 --> 47:02.486
- Could be.
- [Carter] Look out!

47:05.405 --> 47:06.405
Fuck!

47:07.783 --> 47:08.951
What the fuck?

47:09.034 --> 47:11.036
[jeering and joking]

47:11.286 --> 47:12.287
All right. Hey!

47:12.371 --> 47:15.123
You wanna fight, let's fucking fight,
but do it right here!

47:15.958 --> 47:17.584
Come on, let's go!

47:18.877 --> 47:19.962
[door closing]

47:21.755 --> 47:25.467
So, these are the two new ones
for before breakfast.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.682
Jesus! God!

47:33.225 --> 47:34.059
I need gauze,

47:34.142 --> 47:36.937
the large pads and my medical tape. Sit.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.856
[Mrs. Walker]
What the hell happened to you?

47:39.439 --> 47:42.943
Just some spirited hazing, Mom.
Nothing to worry about.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.279
You got in a fight?

47:47.322 --> 47:49.533
This is your chance for a fresh start.

47:50.576 --> 47:53.912
Are you not even remotely capable
of trying to straighten yourself out?

47:53.996 --> 47:56.623
Sadly, Mom,
I think the answer's clearly no.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.792
I need a bandage for this cut, it's deep.

47:58.876 --> 48:02.296
Thank you, Amara Josephine,
I appreciate the concern.

48:09.553 --> 48:10.888

48:44.421 --> 48:47.007
That is some violent redecorating.

48:47.090 --> 48:49.051
Shit, I'm sorry. [heavy breathing]

48:49.968 --> 48:53.972
I thought it was just me and the old man.
So many fucking vases in this house.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.726
Is everything okay?

48:59.436 --> 49:01.563
Why, doesn't it look okay?

49:06.818 --> 49:08.362
Chloe just broke up with me.

49:10.113 --> 49:11.114
I'm sorry.

49:12.950 --> 49:13.950
Why?

49:15.994 --> 49:16.994
[sighs]

49:17.412 --> 49:18.413
I don't know.

49:20.832 --> 49:22.209
She, um...

49:25.837 --> 49:27.756
She was the only one who stood by me.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.468
For a long time.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.184
I thought she believed in me.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.060
[sobbing]

49:41.395 --> 49:42.896
I'll give you some privacy.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.982

49:56.118 --> 49:57.118
Sure.

50:02.290 --> 50:04.626
[Ani] <i>And some might say
he deserved to be in pain.</i>

50:05.210 --> 50:06.837
<i>And how do you argue with that?</i>

50:11.425 --> 50:13.844
<i>Bryce Walker did hurt a lot of people.</i>

50:14.344 --> 50:16.680
<i>Zach and Chloe, certainly.</i>

50:30.027 --> 50:33.071
<i>But I soon realized
the one he hurt most...</i>

52:12.629 --> 52:13.964
[Zach] Do you ever think of it...

52:15.757 --> 52:16.757
now?

52:18.093 --> 52:19.386
[Chloe] Every day.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.597
Sometimes it's fine.

52:23.223 --> 52:24.683
Sometimes I feel ashamed.

52:25.892 --> 52:27.936
No, do not feel that.

52:33.024 --> 52:34.359
I know, you're right.

52:35.902 --> 52:37.821
Shame is what other people put on you.

right?

53:01.928 --> 53:02.928
Course.

53:03.305 --> 53:04.305
Why?

53:06.516 --> 53:08.435
I was there for more than an hour.

53:09.227 --> 53:12.981
Yeah, right. I had to stop by my house
to get my brace and some stuff.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.151
Yeah, right.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.527
Of course.
