to wait about 20 minutes,

09:02.008 --> 09:04.377
because that's about how long
they have left to tattoo.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.545
- I can't wait.
- Patience, patience, brother.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.581
- Patience is my weak point.
- I know that.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.616
While we wait for
the coaches to finish up,

09:10.683 --> 09:12.852
let's get into
the Battle of the Sexes.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.955
[cheers and applause]

09:17.523 --> 09:19.425
Pon.
Dude, what happened, man?

09:19.492 --> 09:22.461
You got so much hate
on social media--it was insane.

09:22.528 --> 09:24.263
- I'm from New York.
We just bust balls.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.865
{\an8}You know, I don't see gender
when I bust balls.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.633
- Would you tell a man
to be in the kitchen

09:27.700 --> 09:30.202
and that's just busting balls?
- [bleep], yeah.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.304
[laughter]

09:31.370 --> 09:32.838
I tell Big Jaz all the time.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.373
- Yeah.
- He kind of gave

09:34.440 --> 09:36.909
{\an7}an accurate portrayal
of what it's like to actually

09:36.976 --> 09:39.845
{\an7}be a female working in
a tattoo shop with other dudes.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.547
That's why I say,
"No tears in tattooing."

09:41.614 --> 09:43.849
If you don't have the spine
to stand up for yourself

09:43.916 --> 09:47.787
and take no crap,
then don't be here.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.155
- Wow, good for you.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.791
[cheers and applause]

09:51.857 --> 09:54.260
Alexis, how was the team
environment for you?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.495
{\an8}- I wasn't crazy
about being on a team.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.531
{\an8}I just never relied on
other people and, you know--

09:58.597 --> 10:00.433
{\an8}doesn't really get you
anywhere, I-I think,

10:00.499 --> 10:02.068
{\an8}but looking back on it,

10:02.134 --> 10:04.303
{\an8}I think I was
a really hard team player.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.072
{\an8}I mean, the flash challenges--
I worked my ass off.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.440
{\an8}- Yeah.
- It's just the moments

10:07.506 --> 10:09.909
{\an7}that counted where you
really should've had our backs,

10:09.976 --> 10:12.311
{\an8}and that's the part that
you kind of fall flat on.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.779
{\an8}- She always had my back.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.047
{\an8}- I did.
- No matter what.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.716
{\an8}- And I always had
your back, too, Ash.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.918
{\an8}I just--well, except when
I put you in the bottom.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.286
{\an8}- Oh, that one time.
- However...

10:20.353 --> 10:21.754
{\an8}[laughter]
That was strategic.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.289
{\an9}- Whatever happened
obviously worked,

10:23.356 --> 10:25.624
{\an9}'cause there's two females
in the finale right now, so...

10:25.691 --> 10:27.927
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

10:27.994 --> 10:30.629
{\an8}- You can't argue with that.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.631
{\an8}It really doesn't sound
like there was necessarily

10:32.698 --> 10:36.402
{\an8}any particular allegiance
among any particular gender.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.206
{\an8}- Everybody wants to, like,
bitch about the "alliance"

10:40.272 --> 10:43.776
{\an8}that went on between
Laura and Cam and myself.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.746
It really wasn't as much
of an alliance as it was...

10:46.812 --> 10:48.581
actually an alliance.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.583
[laughter]

10:50.649 --> 10:51.984
Like--
- It was an association.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.786
{\an1}- It--no bullshit, like,
we--we were in cahoots together

10:53.853 --> 10:57.823
because I respect
these two people so much

10:57.890 --> 11:00.226
that I wanted to see both
of them in the finale with me.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.961
- It's a little bit
more, like, complicated.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.063
{\an8}When I think of, like,
someone who's an Ink Master,

11:04.130 --> 11:08.401
{\an8}I want someone that's--can
work well with women and men.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.370
I don't want this divide
that we have right now.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.372
I'm gonna
support my fellow women

11:13.439 --> 11:15.441
as much as
I'm gonna support him.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.276
- No, it doesn't sound like
it's quite as much, though,

11:17.343 --> 11:18.744
if you really think about it.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.546
- What?
- Well, if you supported him

11:20.613 --> 11:23.315
to get him in the final
and now she's here,

11:23.382 --> 11:25.518
you didn't support
her exactly the same.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.453
{\an8}- You came to us almost
day one, and you didn't feel

11:27.520 --> 11:28.721
{\an8}like your team accepted you.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.122
{\an8}You didn't feel like
anyone accepted you.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.391
You know for a fact,
like, the emotional support

11:32.458 --> 11:34.860
and just, like, the friendship
that you found within us.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.829
You know, that has--
it goes beyond gender.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.798
It goes beyond what
you see against

11:38.864 --> 11:40.166
this "Battle of the Sexes,"
and I thought that

11:40.232 --> 11:41.233
that was almost the point.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.503
[cheers and applause]

11:44.570 --> 11:46.405
- Unfortunately, I got to
stop it right there.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.841
When we come back, all of you
will get a sneak peak

11:48.908 --> 11:51.110
at the coaches'
face-off tattoos.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.512
And we'll get the first look
at how the finalists tackled

11:53.579 --> 11:55.381
their 35-hour back pieces.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.216
Do not go away.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.319
[cheers and applause]

12:06.959 --> 12:09.695
[cheers and applause]

12:09.762 --> 12:12.231
{\an8}- I got to tell you guys,
this blind judging...

12:12.298 --> 12:13.866
{\an8}it isn't that fun after all.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.034
{\an7}- I mean,
this is the first time

12:15.101 --> 12:16.936
{\an7}we've ever been kicked out
of our own show.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.938
{\an3}- The balls on these guys--
they got to hurry up.

12:19.004 --> 12:21.607
{\an1}- I want to see these tats.
They're showing everybody else.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.676
<i>- Man, a few more minutes.</i>

12:23.742 --> 12:26.278
[cheers and applause]

12:26.345 --> 12:27.847
- Oh, hello.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.783
[cheers and applause]

12:33.519 --> 12:36.655
{\an8}I want you guys to know that
I have personally seen to it

12:36.722 --> 12:40.793
that those judges are locked
in their dressing room,

12:40.860 --> 12:42.461
and it's for
your guys' protection

12:42.528 --> 12:47.133
because I have been
caught in the cold abyss

12:47.199 --> 12:50.569
of Chris Nuñez's
disapproving stare.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.304
And I don't want
that for you guys.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.373
[laughter]
I swear to you,

12:54.440 --> 12:57.276
Oliver is probably fashioning
a key out of that toothpick

12:57.343 --> 13:01.213
right now, so we have to be
Johnny-on-the-spot about this.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.016
So let's get
a little sneak peak

13:04.083 --> 13:06.552
at what these coaches' tattoos
are looking like.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.989
Joey, how's my little tattoo
poltergeist doing up there?

13:10.055 --> 13:11.123
{\an8}- All right, Ryan.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.291
You drew surrealism.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.626
How you feeling right now?

13:13.692 --> 13:15.694
- You know, surrealism
is not my wheelhouse,

13:15.761 --> 13:17.163
{\an3}but if we're gonna get
up there and coach,

13:17.229 --> 13:18.898
{\an3}we better put our money
where our mouth is.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.033
- It's definitely
looking amazing now.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.601
- Thank you.
- Sarah Miller,

13:22.668 --> 13:23.669
how's that Bubba
doing over there?

13:23.736 --> 13:26.438
{\an8}- He is in it to win it.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.606
What style did you get?

13:27.673 --> 13:28.874
- I also got surrealism.

13:28.941 --> 13:29.975
It's what
I coached the girls with,

13:30.042 --> 13:31.177
and I can't wait to kill it.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.078
<i>- All my bets are on Bubba.</i>

13:33.145 --> 13:34.713
[cheers and applause]

13:34.780 --> 13:36.215
- Maybe stagger
your bets a little.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.383
That's a lot of pressure.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.386
[cheers and applause]

13:40.452 --> 13:41.720
- James Vaughn!

13:41.787 --> 13:43.055
{\an8}- Hey, girl!

13:43.122 --> 13:44.957
- What you doing over there
with Megan Jean?

13:45.024 --> 13:46.458
- Lord, have mercy,
let me see what

13:46.525 --> 13:48.494
Miss Megan Jean
is working on in here.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.062
[cheers and applause]

13:50.129 --> 13:51.830
{\an1}How do you feel about your
piece, doing black-and-gray?

13:51.897 --> 13:54.800
- I just tried to nail
contrast and come up

13:54.867 --> 13:56.902
with some sort of
sassy little story to tell

13:56.969 --> 13:58.370
in one piece here.

13:58.437 --> 14:01.507
{\an1}- Check this thing out because,
uh, she has gone on the line

14:01.574 --> 14:04.009
{\an1}with this thing and
I am so proud of her.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.978
[cheers and applause]

14:06.045 --> 14:09.281
- Hey, Katie!
What's DJ sawing on over there?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.284
Is he gonna let somebody win
other than himself this time?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.453
- Yeah! Yeah!
[cheers and applause]

14:14.520 --> 14:16.689
- Surprise, surprise.

14:16.755 --> 14:20.159
{\an8}DJ, here you are yet again.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.361
What style did you get?
- I got black-and-gray.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.163
And we went big, so...
- Yes.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.499
{\an3}Do you feel the pressure
to get a three-peat?

14:27.566 --> 14:28.634
{\an1}- [groans]

14:28.701 --> 14:30.269
I mean, it's--ah, man.
- [laughs]

14:30.336 --> 14:32.204
- Just for me to be here,
I think, is pretty nutty.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.173
{\an3}- Looks awesome!
Keep it going.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.874
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah!

14:35.941 --> 14:37.209
[cheers and applause]

14:37.276 --> 14:39.712
I'm so curious to know
how my homegirl Duffy

14:39.778 --> 14:41.213
is doing across the way.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.748
Sausage, fill me in.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.617
[cheers and applause]

14:44.683 --> 14:46.752
- Duffy is doing great.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.154
{\an1}She got the most golden
of skull picks.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.190
How you feeling?
- The style's in my wheelhouse.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.259
However, the design is not,

14:53.325 --> 14:55.561
so I'm trying to get
a little crazy for you guys.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.663
Hopefully I get lots
of points on creativity,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.198
'cause I'm super proud of this.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.232
- It's so good.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.101
So good.
- Thank you.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.069
[cheers and applause]

15:04.136 --> 15:07.473
- Kelly, I hear Jime
is not too happy over there.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.475
- I've known Jime for a while.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.312
I don't know that I've ever
actually seen him look happy.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.248
So, Jime, let's talk
about your feelings

15:16.315 --> 15:18.684
right here, right now.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.553
- Well, I'm feeling pretty
black-and-gray at the moment.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.291
- When abouts did you
raid my dream journal

15:25.357 --> 15:30.129
and come up with a spooky
Halloween kitty cat tattoo?

15:30.195 --> 15:31.997
'Cause that's a little rude.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.299
- Kind of an homage to you.

15:33.365 --> 15:37.169
I tried to pull out
my evil witch-ness.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.171
[cheers and applause]

15:39.238 --> 15:41.307
- I'm not getting
emotional now.

15:41.373 --> 15:42.975
I'm gonna step away.

15:43.042 --> 15:46.178
Somebody has been
uncharacteristically quiet

15:46.245 --> 15:47.713
over there.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.981
Josh.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.382
- [laughs]

15:50.449 --> 15:53.218
- How is my girl Nikki doing,

15:53.285 --> 15:57.690
or has she completely ripped
your heart out with her claws?

15:57.756 --> 15:59.525
- I guess we should go see
what's happening, you know?

15:59.591 --> 16:02.361
{\an3}Did you mess up that spot?
What's going on there?

16:02.428 --> 16:04.697
{\an3}[laughing]
I'm getting thrown out.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.498
{\an1}- Josh, pain in my ass
is what you are.

16:06.565 --> 16:07.866
- [laughing]

16:07.933 --> 16:09.234
{\an3}How do you feel
about getting black-and-gray?

16:09.301 --> 16:12.104
- If anything, I lucked
out because I get to show

16:12.171 --> 16:14.373
exactly who I am as a tattooer.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.974
{\an3}- Now we got, what,
six black-and-gray pieces

16:16.041 --> 16:17.876
{\an3}and Miss Duffy up there
rocking some color?

16:17.943 --> 16:19.445
{\an3}Like, do you feel like there's
an advantage, disadvantage

16:19.511 --> 16:20.846
{\an3}to having something
different or...

16:20.913 --> 16:22.147
{\an1}- Good tattoos
are good tattoos.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.816
{\an1}Doesn't matter if it's color
or black-and-gray,

16:23.882 --> 16:25.217
you just got to do it right.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.354
[cheers and applause]

16:28.420 --> 16:30.556
{\an3}- I know time's running low,
'cause I'm actually

16:30.622 --> 16:31.790
{\an3}the one who's
got all the power.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.158
- Josh! Dude.
- Yeah.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.927
[cheers and applause]

16:34.993 --> 16:36.395
- It's been, like,
six hours, dude.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.763
Are you still talking?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.365
- I don't ever stop.
You know that.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.600
You give me a platform like
this and expect me to be quiet?

16:41.667 --> 16:42.801
- Man, we're tired of waiting.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.403
- There's ten
more minutes left,

16:44.470 --> 16:45.938
so I don't know what you guys
are even doing here.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.072
- Dude, and this guy wonders

16:47.139 --> 16:48.440
{\an3}why they call him
a know-it-all.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.942
- That's not all they call him.
- Yeah, right.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.143
[laughter]
- All right.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.778
While the coaches
finish their tattoos,

16:52.845 --> 16:54.713
the finalists spent
the last several months

16:54.780 --> 16:59.284
in their hometowns tattooing
their 35-hour master canvases.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.893

- Ooh.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.461
- I love this vintage look,

26:03.528 --> 26:05.230
especially in a tattoo
that's done really strong

26:05.297 --> 26:06.765
and powerful like this.

26:06.831 --> 26:08.633
{\an3}<i>- Overall, the composition</i>

26:08.700 --> 26:11.403
{\an3}<i>It's playful, it's got a '50s,</i>
<i>sexy kind of look to it.</i>

26:11.469 --> 26:13.905
- Want to take a guess?
- I don't know, man.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.840
{\an3}Nobody's really pulled
this off in front of us,

26:15.907 --> 26:17.842

who might have done this.

26:36.528 --> 26:37.862
<i>- You have some tricks</i>
<i>in here</i>

26:37.929 --> 26:39.931
<i>where you have layers</i>

26:39.998 --> 26:42.033
<i>and then the lighter color</i>
<i>faded in the back.</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:43.702
<i>And a little bit</i>
<i>of background color</i>

26:43.768 --> 26:45.036
<i>around the front of the tiger</i>

26:45.103 --> 26:46.304
<i>that also plays on</i>
<i>that same color--</i>

26:46.371 --> 26:48.139
It's very smart
color play here,

26:48.206 --> 26:49.441
tying everything all together.

26:49.507 --> 26:51.009
- Totally.
- These guys are really

27:03.355 --> 27:06.124

This is big.

27:06.191 --> 27:08.626
{\an1}- Man, what a great take
on surrealism here.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.962
{\an1}<i>Just really playing</i>
<i>with the in-and-out of focus</i>

27:11.029 --> 27:12.397
<i>of the different areas.</i>

27:12.464 --> 27:14.399
{\an1}<i>Different layers</i>
<i>that really show depth.</i>

27:14.466 --> 27:16.468
{\an1}<i>It doesn't even look</i>
<i>like it's flat on the skin.</i>

27:16.534 --> 27:18.570
- No, it doesn't.
Those blacks are so saturated

27:18.636 --> 27:20.572
to create that depth
and that dimension.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.741
{\an3}<i>- It's got a really</i>
<i>cool graphic look to it.</i>

27:22.807 --> 27:25.243
{\an3}To go for this and to know that
you're up against the clock--

27:25.310 --> 27:27.245
{\an3}there's a strong air
of confidence in there.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.913
- Cray-cray.

27:40.525 --> 27:41.860
Wow.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.462
Compositionally,
to have all that heaviness

27:44.529 --> 27:46.031
surrounding this figure

27:46.097 --> 27:48.466
and then to bring
that soft powdery shading

27:48.533 --> 27:50.668
<i>in the face</i>
<i>is really beautiful,</i>

27:50.735 --> 27:52.404
<i>'cause that thing stands out.</i>

27:52.470 --> 27:54.172
{\an3}- And what's beautiful
is the jawline.

27:54.239 --> 27:55.974
{\an3}You see that nice strong
area around the jaw.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.575
{\an3}<i>You get that nice</i>
<i>light off the bottom.</i>

27:57.642 --> 27:59.744
{\an3}<i>All of the shading</i>
<i>on the darker side of the face</i>

27:59.811 --> 28:01.646
{\an3}<i>stands strong,</i>
<i>but what's great here</i>

28:01.713 --> 28:04.215
{\an3}<i>is the comingling</i>
<i>of the hair with the garment</i>

28:04.282 --> 28:06.484
{\an3}<i>and then these light</i>
<i>little touches of leaves.</i>

28:06.551 --> 28:07.986
Everything has a nice balance.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.821
[cheers and applause]

28:09.888 --> 28:11.156
{\an1}- I think it's gonna
be a super-tight race.

28:11.222 --> 28:12.590

35:06.637 --> 35:09.674
- And welcome back to
the "Ink Master" season finale

35:09.740 --> 35:11.342
in Las Vegas.

35:11.409 --> 35:14.712
All right, the time has come
to end the Battle of the Sexes.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.281
Three 35-hour back pieces,

35:17.348 --> 35:19.617
three very different styles.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.352
- Man, this is gonna be tough.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.287
{\an3}When we look at
these three back pieces,

35:23.354 --> 35:26.524
{\an3}there's a lot of strong things
in all of them.

35:26.591 --> 35:30.595
{\an3}For me, Jason has certain areas
that get tonal,

35:30.661 --> 35:35.066
{\an3}and I also see some areas
in Dani's tattoo

35:35.132 --> 35:36.968
where the top really goes hard

35:37.034 --> 35:38.369
{\an3}<i>and the bottom</i>
<i>doesn't quite keep up.</i>

<i>- So we have</i>
<i>those ridges in the top,</i>

35:40.238 --> 35:42.073
<i>and then the bottom is</i>
<i>kind of a different texture.</i>

35:42.139 --> 35:44.842
- Yeah, but Dani nails biomech.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.043
The background of Laura's

35:46.110 --> 35:47.578

with the foreground.

{\an1}<i>with the seven tattoos</i>
<i>from the coaches,</i>

35:51.782 --> 35:53.251

another tough call

35:53.317 --> 35:55.253
with these three back pieces.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.189
- I think we're gonna
have to eliminate somebody now.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.759
as to who would be the bottom
of the three,

36:01.826 --> 36:04.061
as far as you're concerned?

36:04.128 --> 36:06.631
{\an3}- I think Jason just needs
to bump up the contrast

36:06.697 --> 36:09.667

because all that great work

36:09.734 --> 36:11.202

<i>in certain places.</i>

36:11.269 --> 36:12.403
<i>- Wow.</i>

36:12.470 --> 36:14.238
- There's some really
nice work in Jason's.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.208
{\an1}The thing for me is that
it's leaning more

36:17.275 --> 36:20.411
towards illustration
than it is realism.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.079
That's gonna be my vote.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.450
a feature in "Inked" magazine,

36:59.517 --> 37:02.920
and the title of Ink Master.

37:02.987 --> 37:07.058
{\an1}- Dani totally nails it
with hitting this biomech.

37:07.124 --> 37:08.559
Great tattoo.

37:08.626 --> 37:09.794
- What's exciting for me

37:09.860 --> 37:11.996
is that Dani never took
this style on,

37:12.063 --> 37:13.731
and I got to say, it's probably

37:13.798 --> 37:15.866
the best biomechanical
we've ever seen

37:15.933 --> 37:18.402
on "Ink Master."

37:18.469 --> 37:20.237
- As far as Laura's tattoo,

37:20.304 --> 37:22.673
it's very impressive work.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.910
<i>- Laura's background appears</i>
<i>to me to be a little boxed in.</i>

37:25.977 --> 37:27.678
<i>- It is a little bit boxed in,</i>

37:27.745 --> 37:29.580
{\an3}but it has
a strong power to it.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.782
{\an3}That black pushes
that color forward.

37:31.849 --> 37:33.985
{\an3}<i>The outline</i>
<i>is incredibly strong.</i>

37:34.051 --> 37:35.586
<i>The color is saturated,</i>

37:35.653 --> 37:38.589
{\an3}and that's why my vote
is for Laura.

37:38.656 --> 37:39.690
