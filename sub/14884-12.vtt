I'd love to travel in the same
direction as traffic. Just FYI.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.387
No, they're all meeting us from New York.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.137
We're going up to the North Mountain.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.673
We're not at the North Pole.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.201
Kim, put your feet up.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.871
No, it's not scary at all.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.461
Kim doesn't even help.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.846
<i>We are at 10,000 feet.</i>

33:36.714 --> 33:38.616
I don't think I can get down this hill.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.351
Oh, f*** a duck!

33:41.652 --> 33:44.422
-You guys are landing here.
-Oh, hell no.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.225
Stay low!
