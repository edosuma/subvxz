00:59.125 --> 01:01.559
Hey! It's me again.

01:01.628 --> 01:05.621
This is a very special day.
This is day 756...

01:05.698 --> 01:07.791
of my college experience...

01:07.867 --> 01:11.166
otherwise known as... graduation day!

01:11.237 --> 01:13.671
Whoo! Ah!

01:13.740 --> 01:17.938
Wait for it.
I got the whole outfit. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

01:18.011 --> 01:21.970
I have been planning
for this day for my entire life.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.482
<i>- Um, when I was a kid, I devised
this plan... -</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:26.951
that I cleverly called "The Plan."

01:28.288 --> 01:31.917
Uh, " Dad can't make it to graduation today.
Big shocker.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.925
Can I join you guys for lunch?"

01:33.993 --> 01:35.551
Absolutely.

01:35.628 --> 01:39.621
This is great, because nobody
runs parental interference quite like Adam.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.633
We've been best friends since freshman year.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.363
# This is Ryden's study song #

01:44.437 --> 01:46.871
# I worked on it so damn long #

01:46.940 --> 01:49.374
# It's to give encouragement #

01:49.442 --> 01:52.309
# For your big test today #

01:52.378 --> 01:55.245
<i>Anyway, the plan is pretty straightforward.</i>

01:55.315 --> 01:57.374
<i>One, kick ass in high school...</i>

01:57.450 --> 02:00.613
<i>so that I can get...
two... a fatty scholarship.</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:03.885
<i>Three, limit my beer pong enough...</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:06.551
<i>to keep said scholarship,
which I did, and...</i>

02:08.428 --> 02:09.417
Oh.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.430
Hi, Ryden. Jessica Bard here.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.432
Just wanted to clean the slate.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.434
I'm sorry I nabbed valedictorian...

02:15.502 --> 02:17.697
but you have to believe
I will do an excellent job.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.706
Jessica Bard... my own personal Darth Vader
since the third grade.

02:21.774 --> 02:25.403
Back to the master plan.

02:25.478 --> 02:29.414
Number four. Most importantly...

02:29.482 --> 02:33.748
<i>land a sweet job at the finest
publishing house in all of L. A...</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:36.880
Happerman & Browning,
where I will no doubt...

02:36.956 --> 02:39.015
discover the next great American novel.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.755
All right.
So that's the plan. This is it.

02:42.829 --> 02:47.391
Malby signing off, about to embark on
the first day of the rest of my life.

02:47.467 --> 02:51.426
And, hey,
if you're at graduation, come say hi.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.340
I'll be the one in black. Bye!

02:57.043 --> 03:00.069
<i># You stumble down a yellow brick road #</i>

03:00.146 --> 03:04.947
<i># Spinning your shoes in the air#</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:06.781
<i># The air#</i>

03:08.054 --> 03:11.285
<i># Then you hold your breath
and count to nine #</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:16.158
<i># Hoping that soon
somebody will find you #</i>

03:16.229 --> 03:19.756
<i># Find you #</i>

03:19.832 --> 03:23.063
<i># Go on, go on, go on #</i>

03:23.136 --> 03:25.468
<i># The stars are watching #</i>

03:25.538 --> 03:28.701
<i># Just say, just say, just say #</i>

03:28.775 --> 03:31.073
<i># What you're feeling #</i>

03:31.144 --> 03:34.113
<i># You know, you know, you know #</i>

03:34.180 --> 03:38.583
<i># You gotta take a bow
and do it your way #</i>

03:38.651 --> 03:42.018
<i># It's okay-ay #</i>

03:42.088 --> 03:44.249
<i># La-dada, da-dada, da-dada #</i>

03:44.324 --> 03:47.657
<i># It's okay-ay #</i>

03:47.727 --> 03:50.423
<i>- # La-dada, da-dada, da-dada ##
- Please welcome your class valedictorian...</i>

03:50.496 --> 03:53.590
<i>Jessica Bard, with
tonight's keynote address.</i>

03:53.666 --> 03:55.634
<i>All right, Jessica!</i>

03:59.072 --> 04:01.302
<i>Rock on, Jessie!</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:06.139
Class of 2009, it is my great honor...

04:06.212 --> 04:09.773
to welcome you to this evening's
graduation ceremony.

04:09.849 --> 04:14.912
<i>I stand before you with two age-old words:
Carpe diem.</i>

04:14.988 --> 04:17.855
<i>When we walk out these doors...</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:22.520
<i>I challenge each of us
to not only seize the day...</i>

04:22.595 --> 04:25.086
<i>but to clutch it with both hands.</i>

04:25.164 --> 04:26.791
<i>- You go first.
- To squeeze it...</i>

04:26.866 --> 04:28.026
<i>- Shh!
- with all your strength.</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:30.763
<i>And drain every last...</i>

04:30.837 --> 04:32.327
<i>- living, breathing...
- Could you move down a little?</i>

04:32.405 --> 04:34.839
<i>victorious moment out of it.</i>

04:34.907 --> 04:37.467
<i>Like when a Trojan decides...</i>

04:37.543 --> 04:41.309
<i>...to plunge his blade into the beating
heart ofhis enemy. -</i>

04:41.381 --> 04:45.511
<i>He realizes it's not for
his own personal glory.</i>

04:45.585 --> 04:48.918
<i>- He does it for the better good of the
community as a whole. -</i>

04:50.723 --> 04:54.659
<i>- We must remember that our
generation is smarter... -</i>

04:54.727 --> 04:58.720
<i>...stronger and better equipped than those that
came before us. - Ma'am! Could you keep it down?</i>

04:58.798 --> 05:00.732
<i>- And now...
- I'm dying.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:03.166
<i>it is our responsibility...</i>

05:03.236 --> 05:06.637
to forge ahead and stake
our rightful claim at the top.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.347
- You know what? This calls for a toast.
- Mm-hmm.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.684
- What do you say, huh? Glasses up.
- Hear, hear. Yes.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.347
- To Ryden.
- To Ryden.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.984
<i>- To Ryden.
- Who I'm very proud of.</i>

05:27.060 --> 05:29.927
<i>Mmm. And to Adam.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:33.762
The A-Man, who's here because we like him.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.064
He's also here because
his dad was too busy to come...

05:37.136 --> 05:41.539
and, uh, his mom couldn't
come because, um...

05:42.542 --> 05:44.032
'cause she's dead and...

05:44.110 --> 05:45.202
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.940
- Yeah.
- To your dead mother.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.279
- Hmm. Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:51.484 --> 05:55.284
<i>Anyway, honey, now that you're
out there looking for a job...</i>

05:55.355 --> 05:58.586
maybe you, uh, you know,
come down and work with me.

05:58.658 --> 06:02.958
Uh, she's already got something lined up.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.963
Tell 'em about the big interview.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.432
At Happerman & Browning, Monday at 10:00.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.401
- Wow!
- Hey!

06:10.470 --> 06:12.961
And my thesis adviser is best friends
with the chief editor...

06:13.039 --> 06:15.701
and has already put in
a good word and everything.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.709
And they are building
these loft apartments...

06:17.777 --> 06:20.041
like a block away from the offices, so...

06:20.113 --> 06:22.946
They have these sweeping city views.
I could walk to work.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.540
Didn't I tell you?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.323
What do you see over there?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.883
What do you see right here on this wall?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.519
Uh, white paint.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.063
- Bookshelves!
- Oh.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.567
All my babies,
floor to ceiling, organized by title.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.797
- No, by author. No, by genre.
- Okay. Settle down.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.066
It's amazing. I'll take it.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.402
- Really?
- Really?

06:48.474 --> 06:51.966
Yes! I can feel it.
It's everything I ever imagined.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.171
Hello? I love it.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.080
Here. I've already filled
out the application.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.983
<i>All right then. I'll need a check
for first and last month's rent...</i>

07:00.052 --> 07:03.180
plus security deposit, so $3,500.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.656
Done and done.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.660
Uh... Hey, don't you think...

07:08.728 --> 07:10.958
you're getting a little ahead
of yourself there, killer?

07:11.030 --> 07:13.999
No. No, I don't. I will
have enough money soon.

07:14.066 --> 07:17.263
Okay, well, right here you wrote
"Happerman & Browning" under "employer"...

07:17.336 --> 07:19.702
but you're not actually an employee of them.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.263
In a couple of hours,
that will be true too, so...

07:22.341 --> 07:24.241
<i>Maybe.</i>

07:24.310 --> 07:26.244
Here you go.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.537
Thank you so much.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.606
I'm hoping to
start moving my stuff in on Saturday.

07:31.684 --> 07:35.176
<i>Just as soon as I call your references.
And your check clears.</i>

07:35.254 --> 07:37.950
<i># Wake up, wake up
wake the sun #</i>

07:38.024 --> 07:40.788
<i># Wake up, wake up
hanging like...##</i>

07:40.860 --> 07:42.760
Are we okay? Do we have enough time?

07:42.829 --> 07:45.730
Don't worry. We got plenty of time.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.198
Hey, what's up with Columbia?
Did you hear back yet?

07:48.267 --> 07:51.930
Uh, big envelope, so...
I don't know. I guess I got in.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.234
Wait. Adam.
You might've gotten into law school...

07:54.307 --> 07:57.470
and you haven't even
opened the envelope yet?

07:57.543 --> 08:01.809
The shrug? Adam, you know
how I feel about the shrug.

08:02.915 --> 08:07.579
Another shrug? Adam. I got the double shrug?

08:07.653 --> 08:09.712
<i>Hey, this is your day, okay?</i>

08:21.133 --> 08:22.760
Shit!

08:22.835 --> 08:25.429
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay. No, calm down. Calm down.

08:25.505 --> 08:30.238
- You just calm down.
- Oh... My car! He killed my car!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.770
No!

08:33.846 --> 08:36.871
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, calm down.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.506
His insurance will pay for it.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.114
- Uh! Look...
- It's fine. I'll take...

08:45.191 --> 08:47.386
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.601
- Yes?
- Happerman & Browning offices?

09:04.677 --> 09:06.577
Uh, yes. Eighteenth floor.

09:06.646 --> 09:09.114
- Okay.
- Uh, uh... Excuse me, ma'am.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.240
You got something going on right here.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.714
Oh!

09:19.225 --> 09:21.557
- Thanks.
- Sure.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.681
<i>Happerman & Browning. Please hold.</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:50.454
<i>Happerman & Browning.
Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.</i>

09:50.523 --> 09:55.290
<i>Happerman & Browning. Please hold.</i>

09:55.361 --> 10:00.025
Hi. I'm Ryden Malby. I have an
interview with Barbara Snaff at 10:00.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.829
Yeah. We're actually running
about two hours behind...

10:02.902 --> 10:06.235
so just fill this out and have a seat with
the rest of the applicants, hmm?

10:06.305 --> 10:08.865
<i>Happerman & Browning.</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:14.603
<i>Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.</i>

10:20.519 --> 10:22.612
Sorry.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.318
<i>Yes, Miss Snaff. Right away.</i>

10:29.562 --> 10:31.462
Stacy Moore?

10:32.698 --> 10:33.790
<i>Joe Schrader?</i>

10:33.866 --> 10:34.958
<i>Caroline Hirsch.</i>

10:35.034 --> 10:37.002
<i>Jeffrey Beales?
Kimberly Rice? Beth Brandon.</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:38.661
<i>BarryJenkins. Gregory O'Bryant?</i>

10:38.738 --> 10:40.968
Ryden Malby?

10:51.550 --> 10:53.211
Hello.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.981
- Please. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.985
All right. You... You just graduated, yes?

11:01.060 --> 11:02.789
- Yes, I...
- Major?

11:02.862 --> 11:04.159
- English, with an emphasis...
- Minor?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.164
- Communications.
- Internships?

11:06.232 --> 11:08.359
I actually did three internships...
Penguin, Random House...

11:08.434 --> 11:10.231
And Time Warner.

11:12.471 --> 11:16.430
So, why do you want this job?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.869
Because... this is not just a job to me.

11:20.946 --> 11:25.781
This is... This is what I love.
This is what I'm good at.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.446
When I was 11, at summer camp, all the
other kids would go down to the lake...

11:29.522 --> 11:31.456
<i>and I would be finishing
Catcher in the Rye...</i>

11:31.524 --> 11:33.788
'cause I couldn't get enough
of Holden Caulfield.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.191
<i>And at 13, Bukowski's Post Office...</i>

11:36.262 --> 11:39.629
the most explicit,
inappropriate thing I'd ever come across.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.725
It was like sex ed,
except awesomely foul-mouthed.

11:42.802 --> 11:47.136
Well, I guess what I'm getting at is
that books are all I know...

11:47.206 --> 11:50.175
and everything I love, and...

11:50.242 --> 11:52.437
I want this job because...

11:52.511 --> 11:56.379
well, because I can't imagine
ever doing anything else.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.382
All right. Good. Thank you for coming in.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.233
I got it. Thank you.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.137
- Jessica?
- Hi.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.764
What are you doing here?

12:21.841 --> 12:25.402
They just called me in for a little meeting.
Is that a bow? That's nice.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.605
Jessica Bard?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.012
- Barbara. Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

12:30.082 --> 12:34.246
Dean Brunswick just called me about you.
So glad I could fit you in.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.254
Please.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.847
I can get another job.
It won't be a problem.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.448
I'm a college graduate.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.994
Well, I didn't know you
were a college graduate.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.636
Okay.

13:00.713 --> 13:04.171
That Happerman & Browning thing...
It just wasn't meant to be.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.582
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.654
It's fine.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.815
You should eat one of these.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.218
No, thanks.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.721
You're turning down an Eskimo Pie?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.825
- Mmm.
- Oh, come on. All right.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.095
Every evil, terrible thing
that ever occurs in the world...

13:27.173 --> 13:29.971
is directly offset...
counterbalanced, if you will...

13:30.042 --> 13:35.105
by the complete,
utter joy of biting into an Eskimo Pie.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.877
It's... It's the way
we maintain balance in the universe.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.213
Come on.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.187
Mmm.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.819
Does anyone ever say no to you?

13:46.892 --> 13:49.292
You do all the time.

13:50.396 --> 13:52.694
Okay. Take a bite.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.393
Mmm. Hmm, hmm.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.392
Mmm.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.938
Mmm. Mmm.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.334
Oh, yeah! It's like God's
just giving birth in my mouth.

14:06.412 --> 14:10.678
Okay. That is the girl
that I fell in love with...

14:10.749 --> 14:13.377
but harbors nothing but platonic feelings
for me, unfortunately.

14:16.388 --> 14:20.347
Y... Your foot is freezing. It's 90
degrees outside, and your foot is freezing.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.623
My feet are always freezing.
I have the feet of an 80-year-old man.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.994
Ooh, that's hot.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.069
Oh, so good.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.400
Mmm.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.992
Wait, wait. Hold... Hold on.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.832
<i>No.</i>

15:01.901 --> 15:04.995
<i>- Yes, yes, yes.
- Shh.</i>

15:05.070 --> 15:06.628
<i>No!</i>

15:12.645 --> 15:14.670
Dad.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.943
<i>Juanita. Wow.</i>

15:18.017 --> 15:20.952
Didn't recognize you
without the cash register.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.512
Hi, Adam.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.524
What the hell are you doing here?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.651
Funny.
I was about to ask you the same thing.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.752
- It's my store.
- Come on. Let's go.

15:30.829 --> 15:34.526
- Sorry, Mr. Davies. - Wait, wait, wait.
Actually, I'm really glad you're here.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.425
'Cause you haven't
been home for a while...

15:36.426 --> 15:39.404
...and you definitely were
not at my graduation.

15:39.405 --> 15:42.203
Look, I don't wanna
get into this with you right now.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.004
- Come on. It's time to go.
- Wait. Juanita, is he paying...

15:45.077 --> 15:48.205
I hope he's paying you overtime for this,
'cause you do have rights.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.214
<i>You should call your union.</i>

16:04.463 --> 16:07.091
Well, welcome back home.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.027
<i>Bet you're excited.</i>

16:19.044 --> 16:21.774
Well, let's have a little look-see here.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.349
- There she is! Hi!
- Hey, Mom.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.080
She's home!

16:29.154 --> 16:31.588
Oh, look at that. That's just a crime. Oh!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.023
- Welcome back, baby.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.391
<i>Oh, I'm so glad you're home.</i>

16:38.464 --> 16:40.694
<i>- Uh, Dad, that's gotta get into the shop.
- Huh?</i>

16:40.766 --> 16:42.791
Uh, I'm not so sure.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.998
- What are you doing? - I'm just
looking it over. Gonna be all right.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.100
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.202
You... You're not thinking
about fixing this yourself, are you?

16:54.279 --> 16:56.338
Yeah. Just have some faith
in my abilities, honey.

16:56.415 --> 16:59.111
- Usually there's a spot, if I can
just hear it. - But... Dad!

16:59.184 --> 17:01.550
- You've never fixed a car before.
- Honey.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.417
At one point, I'd never roundhouse-kicked
a man in the neck before either.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.117
Now I do it every Wednesday.
My mind's like a sea sponge, honey.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.854
When the synapses get going in Walter
Malby's mind... boom, boom, boom...

17:09.928 --> 17:12.328
It's gonna be fun.
Don't worry about the car. I got it.

17:12.397 --> 17:13.592
I got the car covered.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.631
<i>Let me give you a hand there, Adam.
That-a-boy.</i>

17:17.703 --> 17:20.103
Good. Look at you. You're a self-starter.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.037
Walter! Walter! Walter! Walter!

17:22.107 --> 17:24.540
- Watch your step there. You should
wear work gloves. - There's a derby!

17:24.609 --> 17:27.704
There's a boxcar derby!
Can we make a boxcar?

17:27.780 --> 17:31.739
- Not now. Not now.
- Pretty please? The derby's next month!

17:31.817 --> 17:34.251
<i>- Can we make a boxcar?
- Oh, geez.</i>

17:36.188 --> 17:39.123
Son of a bitch.
Look at that.

17:39.191 --> 17:43.491
<i>I knew it. Son of a bitch.
Third time. Third G.D. time!</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:45.496
Goddamn it. That's it.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.328
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Look at this. I gotta...

17:48.400 --> 17:50.561
<i>- Walter, no. Don't. Honey?
- Dad, come back.</i>

17:50.636 --> 17:53.662
What? Goddamn.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.731
<i>- We could go home and clean it. - No.
I gotta talk to him. I'll talk to this guy.</i>

17:56.809 --> 17:58.504
You don't need to disturb him. I mean...

17:58.577 --> 18:00.408
He's not home.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.846
I know he's not working. I don't think
he has a job. Goddamn it. Where is he?

18:09.321 --> 18:11.846
Hi.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.524
Hi.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.688
Um...

18:20.165 --> 18:21.496
Hey. Hey. Hey.

18:21.567 --> 18:25.298
Your cat has now crapped on my doorstep,
in my yard...

18:25.370 --> 18:28.032
and now on my driveway, which around here...

18:28.107 --> 18:30.041
is like church to me.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.543
- Okay? That's sanctuary.
- Well...

18:32.611 --> 18:34.545
I'm really sorry, sir. I am...

18:36.582 --> 18:39.983
I'll talk to him. Yeah. I'll talk to him.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.547
- See you later.
- Okay.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.057
<i>Today you are getting a job.</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:57.466
Today... you're getting a job.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.662
Today.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.069
<i># What do you say #</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:03.973
<i># When people turn you away #</i>

19:04.042 --> 19:07.068
<i># Do you just turn your back #</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:09.080
<i># And quickly walk away #</i>

19:10.249 --> 19:13.309
<i># Bah, bah, bah-da-da, da, da #</i>

19:13.385 --> 19:16.218
<i># Bah, bah, bah-da-da, da #</i>

19:16.288 --> 19:19.223
<i># Bah, bah, bah-da-da, da, da #</i>

19:19.291 --> 19:21.919
<i># Bah, bah, bah-da-da, da #</i>

19:24.163 --> 19:28.031
The bottom line is, what I lack in
experience, I make up for in vision.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.658
And what I don't know...

19:29.735 --> 19:32.397
I make up for with passion.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.541
<i># My world, it's on fire now #</i>

19:37.609 --> 19:40.669
<i># My world is turned upside down #</i>

19:40.746 --> 19:43.306
<i># And I don't know what to do #</i>

19:43.382 --> 19:45.077
<i># Without you #</i>

19:45.150 --> 19:47.345
<i>I'm driven. Full of ideas.</i>

19:47.419 --> 19:49.080
I'm upbeat.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.520
Most importantly, I am
incredibly enthusiastic...

19:51.590 --> 19:53.217
About the work your company is doing.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.692
Really? Like what?

20:01.166 --> 20:03.464
<i>#Don't give me a hard time ##</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:06.265
<i>Hunter, I hate getting these calls.</i>

20:06.338 --> 20:09.102
What did I tell you about
licking the kids' heads?

20:09.174 --> 20:11.108
- Don't do it.
- That's right. Ever.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.077
- Okay?
- Fine.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.707
I mean, I know you
like the way it tastes,

20:15.708 --> 20:16.708
but some kids don't like
having their heads licked.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.083
Hey!

20:22.154 --> 20:24.088
How'd it go?

20:24.156 --> 20:26.420
I asked the V.P. if she was pregnant.

20:26.491 --> 20:30.552
- No. She was just fat.
- Oh. Well, that's hard sometimes.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.072
I'm gonna call my friend
Betty from high school.

20:33.073 --> 20:34.547
She owns an indie publishing company.

20:34.548 --> 20:36.432
I'm gonna ask her for a favor.
I'm just gonna do it.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.935
Dad already called her.
Betty's dead.

20:39.004 --> 20:41.404
- Really?
- She died.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.772
<i>That's a shame.</i>

20:44.843 --> 20:47.175
What is it?

20:47.246 --> 20:50.010
- Oh, my God.
- What?

20:56.355 --> 20:58.687
What do you guys think? This one?

21:00.659 --> 21:04.117
Or that little mahogany
number I was in earlier?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.003
Hey, Hunter, come here.

21:13.071 --> 21:17.474
What do you think of Grandma spending
her eternal slumber in this one, huh?

21:19.511 --> 21:22.002
I love it!

21:22.080 --> 21:24.844
- Let's talk about casket ornamentation.
- Ornamentation?

21:24.916 --> 21:28.852
Yes. Casket ornamentation adds a personal
touch many families find comforting.

21:28.920 --> 21:32.686
And we offer a variety of custom corners
and commemorative panels...

21:32.758 --> 21:36.956
to highlight a loved one's passions.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.759
Whatever you want, you could put it
right there on your commemorative panel.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.322
It'll be right with you
through the afterlife.

21:42.401 --> 21:45.393
I'm just not sure about all this.
Thank you.

21:45.470 --> 21:49.133
Really? What do I have to do to put you in
one of my coffins today?

21:51.076 --> 21:54.978
How about a little
magnesium seepage protection system?

21:57.716 --> 22:00.082
Whoa.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.143
That's $18,000.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.269
That's the exact same...

22:03.270 --> 22:06.847
...corrosion and rust technology
that protects our Alaskan pipeline.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.019
- That's what that is.
- That's $18,000.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.757
You know, she's absolutely right.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.767
I mean, why spend all that money...

22:16.835 --> 22:19.895
when there's probably
a nice local ditch somewhere...

22:19.971 --> 22:22.838
you could take me to
and dump me in for free?

22:22.908 --> 22:25.672
Oh, Maureen, we'd never do that.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.799
No, no, no, no! No!

23:17.929 --> 23:19.453
Ooh.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.074
<i>Special delivery.</i>

23:38.150 --> 23:41.142
I got a cell phone, credit card...

23:41.219 --> 23:44.711
student loan and, last but not least...

23:48.493 --> 23:51.291
one more little item...

23:51.363 --> 23:53.422
I thought you might wanna see.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.633
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.169
Come on!

24:00.772 --> 24:02.706
Thanks.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.337
Hey.

24:08.413 --> 24:12.975
Got an idea. Since it concerns your future,
I need you to pay attention.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.417
- You listening?
- No. Dad...

24:15.487 --> 24:18.251
Listen to me. Listen to me. Ready?

24:20.926 --> 24:22.860
Buckles.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.521
Buckles.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.656
Yeah. Belt buckles.

24:27.732 --> 24:31.828
Million-dollar niche business.
They're going crazy on the Internet.

24:31.903 --> 24:36.533
Who do you think met a distributor,
is gonna start his own company?

24:36.608 --> 24:40.669
But, Dad, what about The Luggage Shack?
They just made you regional manager.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.737
You gotta think big picture here.
You gotta have vision.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.840
You know what I'm saying?
You just gotta see the...

24:45.917 --> 24:49.785
And since none of this other crap
is really working out for you...

24:50.956 --> 24:54.915
More than likely... gonna
need a vice president.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.156
V.P.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.864
<i>- You go out there and
drum up some business. -</i>

25:06.938 --> 25:10.101
<i>Come on. Let's go out there and put
some buckles on belts. What do you say?</i>

25:17.282 --> 25:19.910
Are you ever gonna actually open that?

25:19.985 --> 25:24.388
It's made a long journey from New York.
I'm letting it breathe.

25:35.133 --> 25:38.967
- You know, Adam, if you don't wanna go...
- Don't give me that shit.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.775
It's not like I'm gonna force you.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.777
No, you're just gonna hate me if I don't.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.279
No, I'm not gonna hate you.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.619
I just want more for you.

26:08.333 --> 26:13.327
Do you wanna be like me? You wanna
come home from work 11:00 at night?

26:14.973 --> 26:18.238
Save your whole life so you can afford
the mortgage on a place like this?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.711
I'm going to bed.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.007
<i>- Seriously, yeah.
- It's a very funny thing, you know.</i>

26:50.075 --> 26:53.073
People keep calling me, but
I'm like, " Thanks, but...

26:53.074 --> 26:54.845
...I'm working
for Happerman & Browning.

26:54.846 --> 26:57.508
Make me a better offer, we'll talk."

26:57.582 --> 27:00.016
- So what are you guys doin'?
- Me?

27:00.085 --> 27:02.349
- Why, sure.
- Charles Schwab, baby!

27:02.420 --> 27:05.287
- I'm moving to San Jose... dot-com.
- Oh, nice, man.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.518
- You're going to...
- Pharmacy school, next month.

27:07.592 --> 27:11.153
- Yeah, so what are you doing? What's
your deal? - I got into Columbia. We'll see.

27:11.229 --> 27:15.393
<i>Do it. Stay out of the workforce
as long as you can.</i>

27:15.467 --> 27:19.028
Ryden, what about you? What are you up to?

27:19.104 --> 27:21.698
Uh... I just...

27:22.707 --> 27:25.870
You know, I've been interviewing.

27:25.944 --> 27:30.904
A lot. And, um, just had some
really amazing opportunities...

27:30.982 --> 27:34.042
and just keeping my options open.

27:34.119 --> 27:36.519
So what you're saying is you're unemployed.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.588
<i>God. I feel like such a loser.</i>

27:40.659 --> 27:42.923
Everyone is doing something
with their lives...

27:42.994 --> 27:46.020
and I just turn out to be
this big, pathetic loser.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.766
Come on.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.699
No. I don't want your pity hug.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.102
Come on. Ryden.

27:58.043 --> 28:02.844
It's okay, you poor,
poor, no-talent screw-up.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.882
Oh, shut up! You can joke about it.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.883
You already got into law school.

28:06.951 --> 28:09.943
- So?
- So, you're set. You're good. Whatever.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.582
Yeah, maybe I'm set and I'm good,
but does that mean I'm gonna be happy?

28:17.128 --> 28:19.892
- Come here.
- Screw you. I'm not going in.

28:20.965 --> 28:22.728
You don't have to go in. Just...

28:22.801 --> 28:24.632
come out here so I can tell you something.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.571
- I don't think two people can be on
this thing. - Quit bitching and come here.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.143
Okay.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.309
- Come all the way to the edge.
- What?

28:40.485 --> 28:42.646
I'm celebrating.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.985
I'm opening at The Mint on Friday.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.024
- You are?
- Yeah.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.957
- Shut up! Really?
- Yeah.

28:49.027 --> 28:52.622
Adam, so you're going into music then.
Why don't you just say that?

28:52.697 --> 28:55.222
Well, because I'm not
saying that necessarily.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.995
So you're going to law school?

28:57.068 --> 28:59.093
No, I'm not saying that either necessarily.

28:59.170 --> 29:02.298
- Then what are you saying, necessarily?
- I don't know what I'm saying.

29:02.373 --> 29:06.434
All I'm saying is that I'm opening
at The Mint on Friday. Yea!

29:08.913 --> 29:13.145
Look, you got the hard part figured out.
You know what you wanna do.

29:13.218 --> 29:16.085
Now you can just spend
the rest of your life going after it.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.414
This one's popular with all the
college kids. And this one...

29:20.492 --> 29:23.290
- No, no.
- If you like 'em, you sell 'em all...

29:23.361 --> 29:25.192
- I got plenty more... even higher quality.
- That's fantastic.

29:25.263 --> 29:29.359
- Almost unbelievable.
- I am Hugo, the vampire.

29:29.434 --> 29:33.029
- Not now, Hugo.
- Then help me build my boxcar.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.572
I'm doing business now. Doing business.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.438
<i>It's so lifelike. It is. That's real snake.</i>

29:38.510 --> 29:40.842
<i>- All made right here in the country?
- All here.</i>

29:40.912 --> 29:42.474
Geez, that's fantastic.
I'll call you about the rest of them.

29:42.475 --> 29:45.802
All right, buddy.
Thank you. All right.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.719
Hey, who was that guy?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.948
Here, honey.
Grab that box for me, would you?

29:51.022 --> 29:53.855
Carry it inside.
That's Gary. Gary the Buckle Man.

29:54.859 --> 29:57.259
So these are the buckles, huh?

29:57.328 --> 29:59.262
Yep, first shipment.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.821
Hey. Question.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.834
As vice president...

30:03.902 --> 30:07.838
how would you like to spearhead
the marketing campaign?

30:07.906 --> 30:12.570
- The marketing campaign?
- Yeah. You know, ads and slogans and...

30:12.644 --> 30:16.136
you know, maybe some clever ideas
for some of the buckles, like...

30:16.214 --> 30:18.239
I don't know. What do we got here?

30:18.316 --> 30:22.753
Look at this. Look at that one there. That
could be the... like, the Cobra, you know?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.755
Or, uh... I don't know. Here.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.688
Look... Here. This could be the...

30:26.758 --> 30:28.157
Uh...

30:28.226 --> 30:30.251
It's just the flag of
Delaware. I don't know.

30:30.328 --> 30:35.061
But you know what I mean.
Just some thoughts. Just ideas.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.096
You know what I want...
as vice president, Dad?

30:40.171 --> 30:42.105
I want my car back.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.734
I want to stop having to call a taxi
every time I have to leave the house.

30:45.810 --> 30:49.007
I told you. The part hasn't come in from
the factory yet. It's... It's a curveball.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.605
You're gonna get thrown curveballs.
Life and work are like baseball.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.117
You can't rest at the plate.
You gotta keep trying.

30:54.185 --> 30:58.349
But I am trying hard.
I mean, I... I am scouring the job market.

30:58.423 --> 31:02.792
I... I am. I'm getting up early,
and I'm searching for something, anything...

31:02.861 --> 31:04.795
to get my foot in the door.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.388
And do you have any clue
what these interviews are like?

31:07.465 --> 31:10.298
I mean, I'm constantly having to gauge
how I'm coming across...

31:10.368 --> 31:12.666
all the while without a consistent form
of transportation...

31:12.737 --> 31:15.968
because you turned my car
into your latest science project.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.703
So I really don't need to hear
that I'm not trying right now.

31:19.777 --> 31:23.770
Well, maybe you're setting
your sights too high.

31:23.848 --> 31:27.716
Oh, really? Well, where do you think
I should be setting my sights?

31:33.191 --> 31:35.716
If you just give this one a chance,
I know you're gonna love it.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.785
You just have to open it up,
get in there, check out all the pockets.

31:38.863 --> 31:41.661
Ma'am? Sir?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.928
It's on clearance!

31:48.339 --> 31:50.807
Eye contact. Remember? We talked about it.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.809
You gotta bring 'em in. Okay?

31:52.877 --> 31:55.311
<i>Honey, come on.</i>

31:55.380 --> 31:57.974
You gotta have a positive attitude
if you want to sell the suitcases.

31:58.049 --> 32:01.246
Here. Let me show you something.
Hey, how you doing?

32:02.754 --> 32:05.484
- Fine. - You headed out of town,
if you don't mind me asking?

32:05.556 --> 32:08.525
- Yeah.
- Really? Where you going?

32:08.593 --> 32:11.084
- Maui.
- Oh, wow! Hawaii. That's fantastic.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.096
You going there for business, pleasure?

32:13.164 --> 32:15.257
- Business.
- No, don't say business.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.925
- Don't say business. Say pleasure.
Who go... - Pleasure.

32:17.001 --> 32:19.333
- Why do you ask me the question then?
- I'm try... Here. Look.

32:19.404 --> 32:22.862
Let me show you, honey. Do a little
demonstration, you know, right in here.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.205
Like this. You point at the
wheels or something, you know.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.938
<i>- It's like, you know what? Those
girls from Deal or No Deal. - Mm-hmm.</i>

32:28.012 --> 32:32.039
You do that. Maybe not so slutty,
but show with a hand thing.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.640
Here. Go ahead.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.652
Remember... eye contact.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.086
- Okay. Look at the wheels.
- There you go.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.716
- Look how they roll. Oh, it's so nice.
- Yeah.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.386
Here we go. Hot potato.
Right here. Right here.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.362
Are you in the market for some lug...
Oh, crap!

32:46.431 --> 32:48.058
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.295
- I didn't know you worked here at
The Luggage Shack. - I don't work here.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.303
Uh...

32:53.371 --> 32:56.636
I, um... It's... It's temporary.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.505
Right.

32:59.577 --> 33:03.377
Um, how's Happerman & Browning?

33:03.448 --> 33:05.678
Uh, great. Really, really great.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.650
They're sending me to New York
next week for a conference.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.744
- Hence the need for a new briefcase.
- Sounds so great.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.982
Yeah, I saw one over here
last week that I loved.

33:12.056 --> 33:14.251
- Let me take a look at that black one.
- Up there?

33:14.325 --> 33:16.555
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Um...

33:19.664 --> 33:21.962
There we go.

33:22.033 --> 33:26.527
Ah... You know what? I want to take a look
at the one right next to it.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.765
<i>Nope. I gotta trust my
instincts on this one.</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:31.741
I'm saying no to that one.
I'm going back to the original.

33:37.982 --> 33:41.042
You know, things are moving
outlandishly quick for me right now.

33:41.119 --> 33:43.053
Unbelievably fast.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.715
I'll need a good team.
I need people around me I can trust.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.781
This is a no.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.687
Let me take a look at this gray one here.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.629
I thought you wanted a briefcase.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.065
<i>- I'm gonna need both.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

33:57.135 --> 33:59.365
- Lot of traveling.
- Right.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.563
Okay.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.369
That's the one.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.313
You know, Ryden, I think
we've got really good synergy, you and I.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.313
I know you're in a tough place right now...

34:11.382 --> 34:15.216
but I want you to remember that
struggle and strife come before success.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.356
Even in the dictionary.

34:19.424 --> 34:22.222
I'm not gonna take this one.
Can I see that black one up there?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.819
You know what?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.333
Dad! All yours!

34:37.241 --> 34:40.074
Hunty, can't ride Mama's shoe
when she's trying to make waffles.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.078
- Giddyap.
- Come on, honey.

34:42.146 --> 34:44.137
<i>Go play. Go.</i>

34:44.215 --> 34:48.083
- Ride like the wind.
- Honey.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.744
What do you want, Maureen? What?

34:49.821 --> 34:53.348
<i>- Hunter is a very unique little boy.
- I don't want you to coddle him.</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:58.327
I am not coddling him, okay?
I'm just a little concerned...

35:00.164 --> 35:02.098
that he's weird.

35:02.166 --> 35:05.260
Well, of course he's weird!

35:05.336 --> 35:08.965
He's a Malby. Weird is good.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.770
Weird indicates a creative force.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.311
<i>You have no idea what
I go through, okay? Trust me.</i>

35:14.378 --> 35:17.438
- Hey, come on. I wanna show you
something. Come on. - Huh?

35:20.051 --> 35:21.985
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:22.053 --> 35:25.648
# Bum, bum, bum, bum
bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:25.723 --> 35:28.453
It is time.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.959
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:35.032 --> 35:37.159
# Bum, bum #

35:37.235 --> 35:41.296
# Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:41.372 --> 35:43.272
<i>#Bum #</i>

35:43.341 --> 35:44.535
<i>#Bum #</i>

35:44.609 --> 35:46.975
# Bum #

35:47.044 --> 35:50.309
# Bum, bum, bum
bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:50.381 --> 35:54.078
# Bum, bum, bum, bum #

35:54.152 --> 35:56.086
No way.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.879
- It's really fixed?
- Yeah.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.420
Yeah, man.
Your dad doesn't jerk around.

36:05.963 --> 36:08.193
Ooh.

36:08.266 --> 36:12.600
Watch this. Crack this hood.
Take a look at this.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.070
- Now I'm gonna go fire her up.
- Okay.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.077
Look under the engine
and let me know what happens.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.670
I wasn't happy with the timing,
so I tweaked it a little bit.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.943
Think I got her where I like her.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.507
<i>- Ready?
- Yeah.</i>

36:30.788 --> 36:33.848
<i>Ah, it's great! Hey!</i>

36:37.662 --> 36:39.562
<i>Just a little bit more. It's...</i>

36:39.630 --> 36:40.688
<i>Whoa!</i>

36:45.836 --> 36:46.803
Oh!

36:53.644 --> 36:56.135
It just isn't fair.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.513
There you are, this poor, little,
innocent thing that wouldn't hurt a fly...

36:59.584 --> 37:03.315
and then one day
you're murdered by my own son.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.481
It was an accident. Geez.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.718
Why didn't you tell me to look behind me?

37:08.793 --> 37:10.385
What? How is this my fault?

37:10.461 --> 37:14.397
Hon, you always have to keep your eyes open.
Scanning. Constantly scanning.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.933
- You told me to look at the engine.
- Can't do two things at once?

37:17.001 --> 37:19.162
This is ridiculous.
You... You hated that cat.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.695
- Shh. Keep your voice down. - You did say
something about wanting to flatten the cat.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.638
<i>Okay, okay. All right. Fine.</i>

37:24.709 --> 37:28.406
- It was a goddamn accident. - Either
way, somebody has to tell the neighbor.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.211
All right. Geez. I can't believe...

37:38.289 --> 37:40.257
<i>Look out. Look out. Oh, God.</i>

37:40.324 --> 37:44.192
God... Jesus.
Goddamn. Even in death! Jesus!

37:45.263 --> 37:48.426
- Ryden, go with him.
- What? No!

37:48.499 --> 37:50.433
Come on, honey. Look at him.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.100
Mmm, all right.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.201
- Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
- Oh, Hunter, don't do that. No, no.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.435
Dad!

38:03.514 --> 38:06.847
- What?
- Why would you do that?

38:06.917 --> 38:10.284
- Do what?
- That knock.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.687
- What?
- Of all the knocks, that one?

38:13.758 --> 38:17.785
That one is the one you think best says,
"Sorry we killed your cat"?

38:17.862 --> 38:19.853
"Of all the knocks"?

38:19.930 --> 38:23.127
What do you mean, "Of all the knocks"?
How many knocks do you think there are?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.297
No, seriously.
How many knocks do you think there are?

38:28.973 --> 38:31.271
- Let's just make this brief, okay?
- All right.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.671
Cat's dead.

38:35.746 --> 38:39.204
Ran over him on accident.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.553
We're really sorry. Um...

38:43.621 --> 38:46.818
<i>- We didn't mean for it to happen.
- Where is he?</i>

38:52.530 --> 38:54.623
<i>- #Midnight #
- Part.</i>

38:54.699 --> 38:58.999
<i>- #Not a sound from the pavement #
- Let's part the way. Please.</i>

38:59.070 --> 39:03.302
# Has the moon lost her memory #

39:03.374 --> 39:06.901
<i>#She is smiling alone #</i>

39:08.045 --> 39:10.377
# In the lamplight #

39:10.448 --> 39:15.283
- #T he withered leaves collect at my feet #
- There.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.187
- What is that?
- #A nd the wind #

39:19.256 --> 39:22.020
# Begins to moan #

39:28.733 --> 39:31.793
# I can smile at the old days #

39:31.869 --> 39:36.306
<i>- There. All right.
- #I was beautiful then #</i>

39:36.374 --> 39:39.138
<i>- There.
- #I remember#</i>

39:39.210 --> 39:41.474
<i>- Ooh, sorry.
- #T he time I knew #</i>

39:41.545 --> 39:45.311
<i>#What happiness was #</i>

40:09.373 --> 40:11.341
- So, uh, if you need anything...
- Come on. Up. Up.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.001
- here's my card.
- That-a-boy.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.807
Okay? Okeydokey.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.141
Hey.

40:21.218 --> 40:24.187
Listen, I'm really sorry about all this.

40:24.255 --> 40:28.282
I... Well, I can't tell
you how sorry I am, I mean...

40:28.359 --> 40:30.623
about your poor cat and this...

40:30.694 --> 40:32.491
Do you want some breakfast?

40:33.931 --> 40:36.866
- What, right now?
- Yeah.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.868
It's almost dinnertime.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.837
Best time for pancakes.
Do you like pancakes?

40:43.541 --> 40:45.873
- One more?
- No, I'm good, thanks. I'm full.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.435
- Do you not like my pancakes?
- I love your pancakes, but I'm stuffed.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.003
- All right.
- All right.

40:51.081 --> 40:52.810
All right.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.374
No, no, no, no. You go sit.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.114
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.780
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

41:01.625 --> 41:05.391
You know, it's weird. I've never
seen the inside of this house before.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.193
Yeah. Kind of unimpressive, isn't it?

41:08.265 --> 41:11.564
No, it looks exactly like ours, actually.

41:11.635 --> 41:15.366
<i>- Except you have cooler stuff.
- Yeah, yeah. I direct infomercials.</i>

41:15.439 --> 41:17.999
<i>So I end up taking everything home.</i>

41:18.075 --> 41:21.238
Like this. What is this?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.371
- This?
- Yeah.

41:23.447 --> 41:26.075
Well, a couch.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.550
- That's a couch?
- Yeah.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.823
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro...</i>

41:44.835 --> 41:46.530
<i>cinco.</i>

41:46.604 --> 41:48.367
Ah.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.931
Super light.

41:52.009 --> 41:56.002
And can even be used
as a flotation device in case of a flood.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.950
<i>Let's see. I, um... I have no car...</i>

42:01.018 --> 42:03.953
I, uh, lost my job peddling luggage...

42:04.021 --> 42:07.354
- and I now live with my parents.
- All right. Living the dream.

42:07.424 --> 42:08.914
- Yeah.
- That's great.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.965
Yeah, this whole postgraduation thing...

42:16.033 --> 42:19.469
is not exactly turning
out the way I planned.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.700
I just thought I'd be doing
something amazing by now.

42:24.708 --> 42:27.472
Or at least doing something.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.479
Right. Hmm.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.249
Well, listen.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.547
I know it doesn't solve the problem,
but if you need something temporary...

42:40.624 --> 42:43.149
we could always use an extra P.A. on set.

42:43.227 --> 42:47.288
You know, the hours are crap,
and the money is very, very bad, but...

42:47.364 --> 42:49.889
it will get you out of the house.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.970
Yeah. Yeah, that would be good.

42:55.039 --> 42:57.303
- You got a job.
- Thanks.

42:57.374 --> 42:59.171
Cool.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.177
But now...

43:02.246 --> 43:04.180
I think it's time for you...

43:04.248 --> 43:07.183
to start thinking about the good things.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.310
Yeah.

43:10.955 --> 43:13.287
- Like what?
- Like...

43:15.492 --> 43:17.426
your ears.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.855
- Ears?
- Yeah.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.331
- My ears?
- Yeah, you've got incredible ears.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.334
Incredible?

43:26.937 --> 43:28.564
Yeah.

43:28.639 --> 43:31.199
You know how some people
have that... that droop...

43:31.275 --> 43:34.711
that sort of tragic dangling earlobe thing?

43:34.778 --> 43:37.679
Yours... not so, no.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.739
Not a single...

43:47.958 --> 43:50.153
Just don't know why
you had to give him those cookies.

43:50.227 --> 43:52.627
- We'll buy more cookies.
- You know they're my favorites.

44:02.706 --> 44:05.300
Hey.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.970
- Where's Ryden?
- She's paying her condolences.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.514
Fuck me!

44:19.590 --> 44:22.150
Well, I would, but somebody beat me to it.

44:27.798 --> 44:30.028
Cool.

44:43.647 --> 44:49.449
Listen. Dad, I know
that was a little bit awkward, but I...

44:49.520 --> 44:52.114
I just hope you used one.

44:52.189 --> 44:55.454
- One what?
- Used something... That you used something.

44:55.526 --> 44:56.618
Something.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.958
Used a... You know what I'm...

44:59.029 --> 45:01.020
Used a rubber or something like that.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.192
- But...
- Protection!

45:03.267 --> 45:08.204
Oh, uh... But we didn't, uh...

45:08.272 --> 45:11.002
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.
Herpes isn't a picnic.

45:11.075 --> 45:14.306
It's not a river-rafting trip either, like
they want you to think on that commercial.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.369
- River rafting? - Everybody's
having fun with their herpes out there.

45:16.447 --> 45:18.039
- What?
- You know what?

45:18.115 --> 45:21.380
"lx-nay" on the "oodle-day." That's it.

45:21.452 --> 45:24.421
- "Oodle-day"? - You know what I
mean. I don't want you near that...

45:24.488 --> 45:27.821
Don't... Just stay away from the whole...

45:29.660 --> 45:32.595
- pen... penile area.
- Dad.

45:32.663 --> 45:34.995
Don't even see him anymore.
Don't even see him anymore.

45:35.065 --> 45:37.590
- That's it. You can't see him anymore.
- Or what?

45:37.668 --> 45:40.262
What are you gonna do, ground me?
I'm 22 years old.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.931
Oh, really? Well, you're
forgetting you live in my house.

45:43.006 --> 45:46.737
Well, trust me.
I'm doing everything I can to change that.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.289
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:59.356 --> 46:02.154
My name's Bill. And I'm a little upset...

46:02.226 --> 46:04.592
to say the least, if you know what I mean.

46:05.996 --> 46:07.930
Okay.

46:07.998 --> 46:11.490
Someone stole two boxes
of my Buckle-O-Bill belt buckles.

46:11.568 --> 46:13.729
World renowned, uniquely crafted.

46:13.804 --> 46:15.772
Word on the street is
you're trying to sell 'em.

46:15.839 --> 46:19.138
You talking about this? This here?

46:19.209 --> 46:22.508
No, no, no. I bought this
legit from Gary the Buckle Man.

46:22.579 --> 46:24.513
I don't know Gary the Buckle Man!

46:24.581 --> 46:26.981
I know you're trying to take
food out of my kid's mouth.

46:27.050 --> 46:30.019
I don't even have a kid.
But if I did, you're taking his food!

46:30.087 --> 46:32.282
- Uh-uh.
- I want my buckle!

46:32.356 --> 46:34.290
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

46:34.358 --> 46:36.451
I need at least three feet
of personal space here.

46:36.527 --> 46:39.018
- It's my buckle!
- I'm gonna paralyze you!

46:41.231 --> 46:43.199
Crazy, man.

46:43.267 --> 46:45.292
It's my Delaware!

46:45.369 --> 46:48.236
Two fingers. Two. That's all it takes.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.239
<i>I will call the cops, man!</i>

46:51.909 --> 46:55.037
<i>#I don't know #</i>

46:55.112 --> 46:58.741
<i>#Where I belong #</i>

46:58.816 --> 47:02.081
<i>#And I don't know #</i>

47:02.152 --> 47:04.712
<i>#Where I should go #</i>

47:04.788 --> 47:09.282
Wait. So, you're gonna be a P.A. now?

47:09.359 --> 47:12.055
It's just temporary. Our
neighbor hooked it up.

47:12.129 --> 47:14.723
Wait. Rico Suave from across the street?

47:14.798 --> 47:17.858
That... That old dude
who wears the low-rise jeans?

47:17.935 --> 47:21.393
What? He's 34. He's not that old.

47:21.471 --> 47:23.405
Very specific information you have there.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.166
Hey.

47:31.315 --> 47:34.512
So, uh, tomorrow night?

47:34.585 --> 47:36.917
<i>- Yeah? - I wrote
a little "something something" for you.</i>

47:36.987 --> 47:38.420
<i>- For me?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

47:38.488 --> 47:40.422
<i>- Shut up!
- Yeah, you want a little sneak preview?</i>

47:40.490 --> 47:44.221
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

47:44.294 --> 47:49.129
# Ryden is beautiful
It's true #

47:49.199 --> 47:53.602
<i>#'Cause she's got eyes ofblue #</i>

47:53.670 --> 47:58.767
# But then one day I tried to kiss you #

47:58.842 --> 48:03.711
#And you said
Oh, n-n-no #

48:07.951 --> 48:10.476
<i>- You're an idiot.
- You love me.</i>

48:10.554 --> 48:12.488
Anyway, so here's the deal.

48:12.556 --> 48:16.686
<i>Tomorrow night, me, you...</i>

48:18.428 --> 48:19.759
that dress.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.624
Zip me.

48:25.702 --> 48:28.170
Uh, yeah. Um...

48:28.238 --> 48:32.140
So, first of all, I'm just gonna rock
the socks off everyone at that show.

48:32.209 --> 48:35.906
Second, you're gonna throw your bra onstage,
just scream like a little girl.

48:35.979 --> 48:38.641
Um... There.

48:42.552 --> 48:46.682
And third,
we're gonna go out to a big, fancy dinner.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.850
- Multiple forks... everything.
- We are?

48:48.926 --> 48:50.291
- Yeah.
- Why?

48:51.428 --> 48:55.660
To, uh, celebrate your new quasi job thing.

48:55.732 --> 48:58.223
- Just to celebrate?
- Yeah.

48:58.302 --> 49:00.532
- That sounds fun.
- Uh, it sounds...

49:00.604 --> 49:03.300
"fan-crapping-tastic,"
is what it sounds like.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.168
<i>Making guacamole for your family...</i>

49:06.243 --> 49:08.473
<i>orjust for yourself used to be a fight.</i>

49:08.545 --> 49:13.380
But now, with the Guacanator...
the Guacanator 3000...

49:13.450 --> 49:17.887
<i>making guacamole is as
easy as uno, dos, tres!</i>

49:19.623 --> 49:25.391
Senor Avocado... he no stand a chance
against the grips of the Guacanator.

49:29.266 --> 49:31.530
The only assault will be
against your taste buds!

49:31.601 --> 49:33.899
<i>Got it. Got it. Okay, cut!</i>

49:33.971 --> 49:36.565
<i>Okay, I got it. All right.</i>

49:36.640 --> 49:39.734
<i>- And we're clear. - This mustache
is crap. The hairs are going in my mouth.</i>

49:39.810 --> 49:41.801
- I can swear I swallowed a couple.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

49:41.878 --> 49:43.812
We'll take care of that in a sec, all right?

49:43.880 --> 49:46.474
<i>- Thanks.
- Okay, everyone, take five.</i>

49:47.551 --> 49:49.644
<i>- Take a fiver.
- There she is.</i>

49:49.720 --> 49:53.747
- Hey. - How's the first day
going? As shitty as I promised?

49:53.824 --> 49:57.089
- It's not so bad.
- Well, just wait.

49:57.160 --> 50:00.254
Ah. Psst. Bro. Hey, bro! Yo, dude.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.821
Can I talk to you for a second before
you shoot anything else?

50:02.899 --> 50:04.833
Well, this should be fun.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.404
<i>The script is like a
road map, but the road map...</i>

50:09.473 --> 50:12.567
Can you talk to the catering people? The
meat on this sandwich smells like ass-crack.

50:12.642 --> 50:14.269
- Oh, okay.
- First of all, you're really close.

50:14.344 --> 50:17.973
So, congrats. Bones. Awesome. Sweet.

50:18.048 --> 50:20.414
We're getting so close,
but I just wanna go from the top.

50:20.484 --> 50:23.078
A couple things to make this double awesome.

50:23.153 --> 50:26.589
Give me more Mexican. I gotta get
more Mexican. You know what I mean?

50:26.656 --> 50:29.784
I gotta... Oh! I wanna be
on or across the border.

50:29.860 --> 50:34.126
You know what I mean? "Mexi-can." Not
"Mexi-can't" or "Mexi-could." "Mexi-can."

50:34.197 --> 50:37.462
Like any of that flavor,
literally and figuratively, into it.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.796
- Awesome.
- All right.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.804
Second of all, your shots are boring, bro.

50:42.939 --> 50:45.373
Seriously. Here's an idea.

50:45.442 --> 50:47.967
<i>Did you ever see The Matrix?
Movie about, like, alternative reality.</i>

50:48.045 --> 50:51.481
<i>Okay, that shot... Keanu's, like, up in
the air... Bam! He's in the air. Freeze.</i>

50:51.548 --> 50:53.812
360-degree shot... Bam, bam, bam, bam.

50:53.884 --> 50:57.115
Remember what I'm saying? Yeah, like that.
That's exciting. That's awesome.

50:57.187 --> 50:59.587
But check this out. Instead of Keanu...

50:59.656 --> 51:03.217
it's the Guacanator is up in the air,
and you shoot around it, like, 360, 720.

51:03.293 --> 51:05.523
Like, change the axis.
Like, people are totally gonna blow minds.

51:05.595 --> 51:07.324
<i>Matrix. That's a great idea. Yeah.</i>

51:07.397 --> 51:09.831
- Thank you. I wasn't fishing for that.
I appreciate it. - Maybe while I'm at it...

51:09.900 --> 51:11.925
- I could...
- Bring it. Bring it.

51:12.002 --> 51:15.961
Maybe we could hoist it up on a cross...

51:16.039 --> 51:19.236
<i>and we have The Passion of the Guacamole.</i>

51:19.309 --> 51:22.437
Okay. I get it. Do you think that's funny?

51:22.512 --> 51:25.106
I think you're an idiot.

51:25.182 --> 51:27.116
And I quit.

51:28.185 --> 51:30.779
<i>- Told you... Hollywood.
- Can you hear me?</i>

51:30.854 --> 51:32.788
- Let's go.
- I think I have the wrong channel.

51:32.856 --> 51:34.687
- What?
- Let's go.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.953
Hey. Hey, catch.

51:37.027 --> 51:40.121
Hey, whatever.
All right, I'm gonna shoot this.

51:40.197 --> 51:43.462
<i>Can you put him back in the ring?
I got an idea.</i>

51:43.533 --> 51:45.831
<i>- You're fired!
- Thank you!</i>

51:46.036 --> 51:49.062
<i>#She don't know who she is #</i>

51:49.139 --> 51:51.972
<i>#Oh, I can take her anywhere #</i>

51:52.042 --> 51:55.034
For years I had to deal with
this kind of stupidity.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.046
Come on. Can you believe it?

51:57.114 --> 52:00.948
<i>I mean, you can't imagine how many times
I just wanted to walk off set like that.</i>

52:01.017 --> 52:04.976
- My God, I just walked off set.
- Yeah.

52:05.055 --> 52:07.580
And it looks like I just lost another job.

52:09.726 --> 52:12.456
That feels good. That feels great!

52:12.529 --> 52:14.861
<i>#With you eventually #</i>

52:33.683 --> 52:39.315

<i>#A nd I always thought #</i>

52:41.892 --> 52:43.189
Come on.

52:43.260 --> 52:46.593
<i>- #I would end up with you eventually #
- Olé! Olé!</i>

52:54.571 --> 52:57.131
<i>Can we go? You guys ready?</i>

52:57.207 --> 53:00.643
- Where's your guy? Who's your singer?
- Yeah, he's right behind you.

53:00.710 --> 53:02.644
Hey, man, you're on.

53:12.956 --> 53:16.414
You guys good?

53:16.493 --> 53:19.223
So, my name is Adam Davies.

53:19.296 --> 53:21.389
I hope this doesn't make
anyone too uncomfortable...

53:21.464 --> 53:24.922
but I'm completely naked
under these clothes.

53:25.001 --> 53:28.095
This song is for someone...

53:28.171 --> 53:31.663
I, um, care about a lot.

53:35.612 --> 53:36.943
Ready?

53:53.363 --> 53:56.230
# I'm counting the streetlights #

53:57.334 --> 53:59.996
# It's all I can do #

54:58.194 --> 55:02.062
You know what I thought when I met you?

55:02.132 --> 55:04.066
No.

55:06.136 --> 55:11.369
<i>- Aside from the incredible ears,
she's smart and stunning. -</i>

55:11.441 --> 55:13.875
- Absolutely stunning.
- Hmm.

55:13.943 --> 55:15.877
But there was something else.

55:18.381 --> 55:21.248
I just saw a girl that has the whole world
at her fingertips...

55:21.318 --> 55:23.718
and she doesn't even know it.

56:05.862 --> 56:07.193
Good night.

56:22.245 --> 56:24.179
Oh, my God.

56:24.247 --> 56:27.842
Oh, I'm such an idiot. I completely forgot.

56:27.917 --> 56:29.885
- It's cool.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

56:31.154 --> 56:32.644
How was it?

56:33.656 --> 56:37.251
Great. Fine, good... I...

56:37.327 --> 56:40.990
And our dinner... I missed our fancy dinner.

56:41.064 --> 56:45.091
You're getting overly worked up about this,
Ryden. It's...

56:45.168 --> 56:47.102
It's cool.

56:47.170 --> 56:49.900
Besides, you were clearly busy with...

56:49.973 --> 56:51.964
Pelé from across the street.

56:52.041 --> 56:54.532
Oh, no, he... We were at work...

56:54.611 --> 56:57.603
- and then there was this big blowup,
so we left, but it was... - Uh-huh.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.241
Awesome. I'll see you later.

57:01.317 --> 57:05.048
- Wait. What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

57:05.121 --> 57:07.351
Just let me explain.

57:09.559 --> 57:11.493
What exactly needs explanation?

57:11.561 --> 57:13.552
The fact that I've been
waiting around like a moron...

57:13.630 --> 57:17.430
hoping that one day you'll actually
feel about me the way I feel about you?

57:17.500 --> 57:20.060
Or the fact that you're so obsessed
with your future...

57:20.136 --> 57:24.800
that y-you completely forget about everyone
that you're supposed to give a shit about?

57:29.579 --> 57:34.107
I'm not waiting anymore. I'm done.

57:38.354 --> 57:42.654
I may not know exactly what my future
looks like, but I do know one thing.

57:45.995 --> 57:47.986
You're not in it.

58:12.956 --> 58:14.947
Oh...

58:20.563 --> 58:23.157
...say can and will be used against
you, okay? - I didn't know they were hot.

58:23.233 --> 58:25.497
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Bought them on the Internet.

58:25.568 --> 58:27.654
Can't afford one, one will
be provided to you by the state.

58:27.655 --> 58:29.218
This is so stupid. I can't...

58:30.106 --> 58:32.040
Didn't have to be this way.

58:32.108 --> 58:34.576
<i>Grab your brother. Get him in the car.</i>

58:34.644 --> 58:36.908
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go get in the car.

58:36.980 --> 58:38.914
I had absolutely nothing to do with this.

58:38.982 --> 58:42.179
You can ask anybody,
and they'll tell you. I hate crime.

58:42.252 --> 58:44.812
It's okay. It's okay.

58:58.334 --> 59:01.394
The good news is your husband
doesn't have any priors.

59:01.471 --> 59:03.462
The bad news is we're
gonna have to hold him.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.202
Trafficking stolen
property is no small crime.

59:06.276 --> 59:09.109
- The bail won't be set till tomorrow.
- You're keeping him overnight?

59:09.178 --> 59:11.976
- But he's not a criminal. He's
just a moron. - That's the breaks.

59:14.017 --> 59:18.477
I told you. I told you in
1976. Do not marry Walter Malby.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.284
<i>He's your son.</i>

59:20.356 --> 59:22.950
- And I did the best I could with
what I had. -

59:23.026 --> 59:27.656
Yeah, well, your best effort is in jail
till tomorrow morning.

59:27.730 --> 59:31.894
Hey. Pick up. I've called you 80 times.
I'm really, really sorry.

59:31.968 --> 59:35.404
I... Call me back.

59:35.471 --> 59:39.407
Where's Dad? I wanna go home.

59:49.319 --> 59:51.287
Try and have a good one, all right?

59:55.558 --> 59:58.925
Mrs. Malby? Miss?

59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.895
<i>Yes? Yes?</i>

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.898
<i>- Hey, morning. How you doing?
- Hi. Morning.</i>

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:06.766
<i>Um, so, basically, in order to bail him out,
you're looking at 15,000 bucks.</i>

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.771
- Oh, my God. What? - Or he stays
in the slammer until the trial.

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.830
Oh, God.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.372
$15,000.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.682
Well, let's go home.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.119
- Maureen?
- What?

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:26.621
Wait.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.953
Cough it up.

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.390
Cough what up?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.554
Pay the man your son's bail money.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.292
Are you crazy?

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.529
You think if I had that kind of dough
I'd be living with you?

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:42.730
Cut the baloney, Maureen. Please.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:47.367
I know you have money.
I know you sew it into your panty hose.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:50.344
And I know you've got
it under your mattress...

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:54.315
<i>and shoved up inside
every shoe in your closet.</i>

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.375
Pay the man.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:03.088
Why can't my family just
love me for my soul...

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:07.027
instead of my meager possessions
and my bank account?

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:09.496
Well, I love your soul, Grandma.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:27.510
Okay, um... Will you take a check,
or do you want the green stuff?

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.644
<i>I'm free!</i>

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.257
I'm free!

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:42.058
Look at the sky.
Can you see how blue the sky is?

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:46.260
This entire experience has transformed me.

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:48.963
I am a new man. The old Walter is dead.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:52.405
But the new Walter
wants to say how much I love you guys.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.636
I'm a new man, and we're a new family.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.442
<i>I mean, look,
we have our problems. What family doesn't?</i>

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.978
I know I get to be bullheaded. And,

01:01:59.979 --> 01:02:03.485
you know, Ryden here is
essentially unemployable.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.748
Hmm?

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:08.279
Hunter licks people, and...

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:12.293
Grandma's very, very...

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:14.261
very... kind.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.264
So kind.

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:20.894
<i>But, no matter what, we're a family.
We're a real family.</i>

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.495
We're the Malbys, damn it.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:28.402
From now on, it's Malby time.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:32.642
Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:35.582
Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.552
Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:42.284
Malby! Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.293
Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:48.694
Malby! Malby! Malby!

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:54.662
That's all right, honey.
I'll just take a cab over to the curb.

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:57.103
<i>- Malby!
- Grab my purse.</i>

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:59.300
- My purse. - Did you leave it
at the police station, Maureen?

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.866
<i>- No, I didn't leave... I thought
you had it. -</i>

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.071
<i>- I don't have your purse.
- Adam?</i>

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:07.674
- I'm looking for Ryden Malby.
- That's me.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.913
This is Barbara Snaff
from Happerman & Browning.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:14.923
Listen, the position you interviewed for
just came available again.

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:17.619
You wanna fire me? Fine. I don't care.

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:20.992
I'm gonna own this town. And I'm gonna come
back, and I'm gonna take you down.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.691
Wait... Wait, are you serious?
You're offering me the job?

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.668
Yes. Absolutely. When can you start?
The job is yours if you want it.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.365
Immediately! Absolutely, yes.

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:33.533
Great. I'll have my assistant call you
with all the details.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.770
- Thank you. Perfect.
- She's not there anymore.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.643
- Guys, I got the job! I got the job!
- Yea!

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:42.206
<i>- Does it pay? Does it pay?
- Yeah, it pays!</i>

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:45.311
- Malby! Malby!
- Malby! Malby!

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.481
- Malby! Malby!
- She got a job!

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:53.356
Okay.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:01.368
Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:05.499
Okay. Silent treatment. I get it.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:09.409
<i>Very fifth grade of you. But very effective.</i>

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:13.471
<i>Please call me. Please?</i>

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.496
Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.902
All right.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:38.330
Just... call me when you're ready.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.692
Yo, yo.

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:01.457
I got him. I got him.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:05.159
<i>Yeah, yeah, go. Go, Adam.
Take it in. Take it in.</i>

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.223
<i>Yes!</i>

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:09.066
- Nice shot.
- All right. Check ball.

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.800
<i>I'm open right here.</i>

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:23.347
Someone once told me that every...

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.717
evil, horrible thing in the world...

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:30.418
can be directly counteracted by
the joy of a simple dessert.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.893
<i>I'm really sorry, Adam.</i>

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:34.063
I know you don't wanna talk to me,

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:37.120
but I really have something
to tell you. I wish you...

01:05:37.155 --> 01:05:38.760
Hold on a second.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:42.835
If you don't forgive
me, I will follow you...

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:46.272
<i>everywhere you go,
playing this extremely annoying song...</i>

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:49.209
till you slowly go insane.

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.149
Okay. Just make it stop.

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:56.207
Ha!

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.850
<i>How do you steal an ice cream truck?</i>

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.585
Borrow.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.184
My dad knows a guy that knows a guy, so...

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.991
Of course.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.622
Look.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.639
I'm good.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.237
I'm so sorry I flaked on you, Adam.

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.803
You would never do anything like that to me.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.872
And I've been thinking a lot about...

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.680
- I accept your apology.
- Wait. You have to let me get this out.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:33.688
I have been thinking a lot
about what you said...

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:37.590
and I think you just...
maybe you just threw me because...

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.220
Look, it's fine.

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:43.754
Really, it's... It's all good.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:47.360
I'm just...
You know, I'm in the middle of a game.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.427
- Yo.
- Well, wait.

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:52.804
Um, do you wanna,
I don't know, hang out later? Um...

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:55.537
Oh, we could celebrate,
'cause I didn't get a chance to tell you...

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:57.772
but I got that job at Happerman & Browning.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.274
That's awesome.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.342
Uh, I...

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.514
But I can't get together later,
'cause I kind of need to pack.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.717
Pack?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.824
Yeah. Uh...

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.864
Look, I didn't get a chance to tell you...

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:18.297
but I decided to go to Columbia.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:23.303
And I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:26.933
What? You're going to law school?

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:28.943
In New York?

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.070
Yeah.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.441
That's...

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.384
That's... so great.

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:39.921
- Congratulations. - Yeah, I think
it'll be... I think it'll be good.

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:45.316
Look, I promise I'll call you...

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:48.056
as soon as I get settled in, okay?

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:50.189
<i>- Okay.
- Let's go.</i>

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.291
<i>Come on, Adam. Ball in. Ball in. Ball in.</i>

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.768
<i>Hold up.</i>

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.600
<i>- Our ball.
- All right.</i>

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:03.737
<i>- Our ball.
- Check it up. Check it up, Adam.</i>

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.975
Our ball.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:11.586
All right.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.252
Ball.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.995
Okay.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.023
Hi. I'm Ryden Malby. I'm...

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.723
The new assistant to the editor. Yes.
One sec. I'll get Lloyd.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.698
<i>I've got Ryden. Thanks.</i>

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.828
Well, here it is. Home, sweet home.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:04.372
- That's the mail cart.
- Great. Well, perfect.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:07.033
Is there any material
you want me to start to read or...

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.770
No. Reading's on your own time.

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:12.837
Jessica was a shit filer,
so we're a little backed up on submissions.

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:16.475
I see that.
What happened toJessica anyway?

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:19.988
Well, we had a little bit of
a misunderstanding, she and I.

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:23.821
You see, I thought that she worked for me.
She thought she was running the company.

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.827
- Sounds likeJessica.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.363
- Ready to go?
- Yep, I'll get right on it.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.228
You know you're gonna have to enter every
one of these into the database, right?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.234
Okay. Absolutely. Yeah.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:43.207
- Hi.
- Oh!

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.406
Of course.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.415
<i>#Apicture paints a thousand words #</i>

<i>Okay. I've got it right here.</i>

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.358
My life is a shit-storm. I got way
too much crap to keep in my own brain.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.693
So, what do I do?

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:16.437
<i>- #Say what you say # - I think

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.069
Get the puppet out of my face.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:47.836
Come on. All the
other kids' dads are practically done.

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:52.203
Fine. Forget it.

01:10:56.885 --> 01:11:00.184
Hunter. Wait a minute.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.802
When's that race again?

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.133
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.330
Saturday.

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:25.172
Go get your mother, your grandmother.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:28.648
We need every able-bodied man
we can get. Go.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.889
- Just move all my Thursday
appointments to Friday. - Okay.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.152
Oh, and you're gonna wanna get
some beauty sleep this weekend...

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:40.024
'cause I want you to sit in
on the Asia conference on Monday morning.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.255
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:44.299
- Oh, great. I'd love to. That'd be great.
- Great.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:47.130
- Oh, you forgot one. Sign and date. There.
- Oh. Okay.

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:50.137
- All right. "Buenos nachos."
- Good night.

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.537
Hey, try to get out of here
by 9:00 tonight, will you?

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.542

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.947
And I'm working my ass off.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.384
But I always expected that.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.716
What are all the boxes for?

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:44.258
Moving back to Brazil.

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:46.260
Are you serious?

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.762
Yeah. My life is there.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.924
I haven't seen my family in ages.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:55.299
And I come home every night to what?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.465
I guess I finally realized that...

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.476
what you do with your life
is really just one half of the equation.

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:05.907
The other half...

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.745
the more important half really, is...

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:11.115
who you're with when you're doing it.

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:37.937
Okay, come on! Come on.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:41.005
Come on.
You got plenty of room. You got miles.

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.516

Oh, geez.
Hey, keep this on the down-low, Mom.

Get dressed. We're late.

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.342

<i>- And it's "drive well,"honey, not

I want you to drive well.

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:43.689
By the way, you won!

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.757

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.489

01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:53.556
Okay.

<i>- It's so cool.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.205
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.214
Mom, Dad...

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:57.691
Sure you don't wanna get a little shut-eye
and see how you feel in the morning?

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.700
Nope.

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.171
Just out of curiosity though,
do you think I'm making the right decision?

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:17.445
Well, you know,
ever since you were a little kid...

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.453
you always seemed to have it figured out.

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.716
You know, you made good grades, you...

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.453
kept your room neat and clean,
you ate your vegetables.

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.396
Can I be honest with you?

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.830
I always found it a little troubling.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.358
<i>Because, see, hon...</i>

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:38.672
the world's a screwy place.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.799
It doesn't play by the rules.

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:45.511
So if you're asking me...

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.913
do I think it's a good
idea for you to, uh...

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:51.418
quit your job...

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:53.420
leave behind the only family you have...

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:56.082
and travel 3,000 miles...

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:58.149
to a place you've never been before?

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:04.555
I think it's the most kick-ass idea
you've ever had.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:11.501
'Cause I think no matter where you are,
you're gonna knock 'em dead.

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:16.043
Thanks, Dad.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.210
- See ya.
- Okay.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.253
- Love ya, honey.
- Love ya. Bye.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.345
No good-byes. Just see you later.

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:30.050
You be careful in New York.
There are a bunch of kookies there.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.559
- Okay, I will.
- Call me frequently, okay?

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:35.460
- Okay. - I've got you on my
speed dial, and you're on mine.

Hey.

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.957
Life sucks without you.

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:18.431
I miss you. I...
Well, of course I miss you. I...

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.027

"Hey, we had some great times...
you know, keep in touch" kind of thing.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:30.601
It's... It was more like,
"I can't eat... I can't sleep...

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:34.775
I forget what it feels like to laugh"
kind of thing.

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:38.785
And I really think that when you left...

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.185
you took my heart with you.

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:54.027
Um...

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.127
I- I probably should've called first.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.468
Oh, whoa. Whoa. No, no, no. Hold...

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.567
Ryden! Whoa!
Where are you... Where are you going?

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.305
Ryden!

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.049
<i>Ryden. Ryden, hey. Wait. Hold up.</i>

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.681
Look. Hey. Stop. All right? Hey.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.522
She's my R.A.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:24.689
I was just filling out a maintenance report.

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:27.599
- She's not...
- No.

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.034
Really?

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.197
Yeah.

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.258
I love you.

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.519
Well, that's good.

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:57.292
'Cause I love you.

01:23:57.365 --> 01:24:00.391
<i>#Some kind of magic #</i>

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:06.205
<i>#Happens late at night #</i>

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.208
- Wanna go inside?
- Yeah.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:12.235
<i>#When the moon smiles down at me #</i>

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:17.041
<i>- Hey, Walt, it's Ryden.
- Oh.</i>

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.279
- Hey, sweetie-pie.
- It's her machine, so leave a message.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.584
Oh. Hey, guess who's coming for a visit.

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:24.887
We got cheap-ass tickets
on CheapAssTickets-dot-com, swear to God.

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:27.655
Ask Adam if he's got a pull-out,
'cause Grandma's got that heinous hump.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.959
- 'Cause I don't wanna have her
suffering more than she... - Stop that!

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.965
I don't have a hump! Give me that.

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:35.264
I don't have a hump. I can sleep
anyplace you wanna put me, Ryden.

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.270
And, honey, it's genetic,
so take your calcium.

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.636
And don't forget to layer up, okay?
You're from California.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:42.733
- And remember, condoms are
your best friend. - Oh, you have to...

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:47.447
<i>Wait, like, the whole family's coming?</i>

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:51.110

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:28.422
