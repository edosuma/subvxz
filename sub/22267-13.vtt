00:04.116 --> 00:05.279
- Rebecca.
- Trent?!

00:05.346 --> 00:07.629
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?!

00:07.697 --> 00:10.261
I'm gonna have to blackmail you
into being my girlfriend again.

00:10.352 --> 00:12.473
You should know by now
that I'm not interested.

00:12.541 --> 00:14.090
I thought we were written
in the stars,

00:14.158 --> 00:15.408
but I guess I was wrong.

00:15.494 --> 00:17.994
Feeling a little emotional.
I think it's 'cause everything

00:18.062 --> 00:19.500
in this town reminds me of Darryl.

00:19.568 --> 00:21.439
The three of us are just
gonna have a baby together.

00:21.507 --> 00:22.551
It's no big deal.

00:22.619 --> 00:23.845
We don't keep secrets

00:23.913 --> 00:25.666
and we don't lie to each other, okay?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.900
We've discussed it and we don't do it.

00:27.994 --> 00:30.148
Trent doesn't just have dirt
on me.

00:30.384 --> 00:32.619
- He has dirt on you, too.
- Oh, my God.

00:32.735 --> 00:35.242
Turns out I'm not only
good at ruining my own life,

00:35.366 --> 00:38.421
I'm really good at... ruining
other people's lives.

00:38.523 --> 00:42.163
I'm gonna mail him my poop,
but tell him it's cupcakes.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.377
I slept with my ex-boyfriend's dad.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.867
You kidnapped my mother!

00:45.935 --> 00:47.671
I may have ordered a hit

00:47.739 --> 00:49.437
on Nathaniel's girlfriend, Mona.

00:49.765 --> 00:52.398
I mean, sometimes I do
things that aren't great.

00:52.466 --> 00:53.640
No, you're good.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.132

03:01.476 --> 03:04.297
Ah, well, you cheated on me a ton.

Okay. 
I should've seen that coming.

Okay, Heather, how are
you feeling this morning?

03:19.781 --> 03:22.218
Yeah, it's a lot of
people. I know it's weird.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.679
Darryl invited them all.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.547
Well, it's a week until your due date,

03:25.624 --> 03:27.419
so this could be your last
appointment.

03:27.617 --> 03:29.172
I want all my loved ones around me.

03:29.295 --> 03:30.823
So, I brought...

03:30.976 --> 03:33.320
Oh, Auntie Paula, two-time
mother, birthing sage,

03:33.388 --> 03:36.063
unofficial supervisor
of this whole enterprise.

03:36.203 --> 03:37.641
I'm Hector, Heather's boyfriend,

03:37.749 --> 03:39.845
and surprisingly cool
with this whole situation.

03:39.913 --> 03:42.393
- He's the only one I invited.
- I'm Valencia.

03:42.461 --> 03:44.957
I like to record things for posterity
and my own sense of self.

03:45.065 --> 03:46.714
I know what it's about now.

03:47.382 --> 03:49.015
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

03:49.083 --> 03:50.645
There's a long line
in the cafeteria.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.072
This is my girlfriend, Beth.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.179
We're in a love bubble, so
we always like to be together.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.283
Mwah.

03:55.351 --> 03:56.393
Oh, that was good.

03:56.461 --> 03:58.195
Sorry, guys. Is it too much?

03:58.391 --> 03:59.820
A little.

04:03.945 --> 04:06.317
Oh. I'm Rebecca.

04:06.386 --> 04:07.781
I donated the egg,

04:07.849 --> 04:11.359
so that thing has my DNA in it,
so good luck with that.

04:11.548 --> 04:14.478
And I'm Dr. Pratt and
I'm gonna be delivering the baby,

04:14.546 --> 04:16.878
so I'm also important.

04:17.152 --> 04:19.047
You know what?
You got this.

04:19.115 --> 04:20.773
You look,
you look like a doctor.

04:20.841 --> 04:23.039
I'm so tired.
I'm just gonna take a nap

04:23.107 --> 04:27.007
on, uh, that gurney outside.
Yeah.

04:27.377 --> 04:29.372
And the rest of you are
just gonna stay?

04:29.557 --> 04:31.101
Oh, yeah.
No, it's fine.

04:31.203 --> 04:33.831
I mean, one way or another,
we've all seen one, so...

04:33.908 --> 04:35.375
All right, let's get started.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.112
Heather, uh, any concerns?

04:37.189 --> 04:39.070
Oh, yeah, um, birth.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.486
So, I agreed to carry this baby
for free

04:41.554 --> 04:42.861
because
I'm whimsical and random,

04:42.896 --> 04:45.946
but now I have to give
birth to a baby... uh, oops.

04:46.065 --> 04:48.463
So, can you just, like,
hit me in the head with a hammer

04:48.531 --> 04:50.878
and wake me up when it's over
like they did in the '50s?

04:50.955 --> 04:52.505
Oh, honey, no.

04:52.603 --> 04:53.995
No, no, no, no.

04:54.063 --> 04:55.618
You don't want
to miss birth.

04:55.845 --> 04:59.820
It's an awe-inspiring
and powerful experience.

05:00.056 --> 05:02.734
Yeah, but, like,
does it hurt?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.406
Well, women report different levels

05:04.474 --> 05:05.535
of discomfort depending...

05:05.606 --> 05:07.968
Ah, Ba-Ba-Ba,
Dr. No Vagina.

08:29.614 --> 08:31.641
So, what was with you back
there in the exam room?

08:31.709 --> 08:34.961
Ugh, I'm sorry about that.
I just haven't been sleeping.

08:35.029 --> 08:36.422
What?

08:37.342 --> 08:39.570
I keep having nightmares
about Trent.

08:40.205 --> 08:42.679
I don't know.
He's still in my head.

08:42.940 --> 08:47.136
Yeah. I've been feeling
guilty about that a lot lately.

08:47.497 --> 08:49.016
Why are you feeling guilty?

08:49.084 --> 08:52.789
It was, it was my idea to find
a fake boyfriend on Facebook

08:52.857 --> 08:53.870
to make Josh jealous,

08:53.938 --> 08:55.310
and I feel terrible

08:55.387 --> 08:57.641
because I brought this
monster into your life.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.891
Into our life, so...

08:58.984 --> 09:01.141
No. You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

09:01.209 --> 09:02.820
First of all,
I was in on that with you,

09:02.888 --> 09:05.500
and then I let him stay
with me and cook for me

09:05.568 --> 09:08.781
and clean for me and,
I mean, I took his virginity.

09:09.366 --> 09:11.016
So, Trent is not your fault.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.729
Well, I mean, regardless,
it would make perfect sense

09:13.797 --> 09:14.987
you're having bad dreams
about him.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.820
I mean, he tried to
blackmail you, and me.

09:18.203 --> 09:19.830
Yes, he tried to... you're right.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.440
He tried to blackmail both of us.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.031
He did.
He tried to blackmail us.

09:23.164 --> 09:25.310
Well, listen,
don't worry.

09:25.387 --> 09:26.742
He is gone.

09:27.086 --> 09:28.664
I still have a tracker on him

09:28.813 --> 09:30.476
and I check his Instagram
every day.

09:30.544 --> 09:33.422
He... is in Iowa...

09:34.484 --> 09:35.828
with his mom.

09:36.281 --> 09:37.617
Yeah, you're right.

09:37.738 --> 09:39.455
- He's gone. He's gone.
- Yup.

09:39.523 --> 09:40.650
It's-it's in my head.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.950
Did you
hear what I just said?

09:43.585 --> 09:46.132
- Yeah.
- In the, uh, in the Harding case,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.593
we should
depose the CEO and CFO.

09:48.661 --> 09:50.562
Exactly. And if...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.781
You don't look great.
Are you okay?

09:54.765 --> 09:57.828
Yeah. I, uh, I just
haven't been sleeping much.

09:57.896 --> 09:59.646
- Pretty tired.
- Ah.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.640
I've been meaning to tell
you, um...

10:03.837 --> 10:08.560
I'm having a party Friday
night and you are not invited.

10:09.866 --> 10:11.096
Okay.

10:11.204 --> 10:13.968
Yeah. Mona and I
are  moving in together.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.569
Wow.

10:17.039 --> 10:19.523
Oh. Cool.

10:19.750 --> 10:23.625
We are, um, having a few
people over for a little soiree,

10:23.693 --> 10:24.909
and, you know, some of the more

10:24.977 --> 10:26.847
tolerable people from
the office are coming.

10:26.915 --> 10:28.540
I didn't want you
to get blindsided

10:28.608 --> 10:29.914
if you'd heard about it.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.275
I see, uh...

10:32.625 --> 10:34.586
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.982
Well, that's big of you.

10:37.187 --> 10:38.593
I want you to be happy.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.492
I'm the one who broke
things off with you.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.773
Like, I'm not insane.

10:44.172 --> 10:45.395
The hell?

10:49.111 --> 10:52.487
I... I just... I saw...

10:55.750 --> 10:57.427
Is everything all right?

10:57.605 --> 10:59.388
Are you okay?

11:00.468 --> 11:02.132
So I think I'm losing my mind.

11:02.277 --> 11:04.081
Uh, I might be having
dissociative episodes.

11:04.149 --> 11:07.500
So what happened is
i hallucinated Trent this morning.

11:08.078 --> 11:09.875
Like, I saw him.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.195
I mean, I've been seeing
him in my dreams for days,

11:12.263 --> 11:13.268
which is one thing,

11:13.336 --> 11:15.187
but seeing apparitions
of him in real life?

11:15.255 --> 11:16.562
Well, maybe
it's not mental illness.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.389
Maybe it's just your imagination.

11:18.507 --> 11:21.023
Our imagination can do
crazy things.

11:21.336 --> 11:24.187
Sometimes, I imagine that
I'm a pilgrim.

11:25.237 --> 11:26.892
- Okay. Thank you.
- Mm.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.572
Thank you for that, Bert.
I appreciate that.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.039
And thank you, everyone,

11:30.140 --> 11:32.634
for coming here on such short
notice in between sessions.

11:32.711 --> 11:34.869
I just couldn't wait
until Monday, you know?

11:34.946 --> 11:37.372
You offered to buy us all
crudo, so, yeah, I'm here.

11:37.449 --> 11:38.939
How have you
been feeling lately?

11:39.007 --> 11:42.101
Have you scanned
your emotional system, or whatever?

11:42.537 --> 11:45.460
Uh, okay. Uh, let me do a quick scan.

11:45.735 --> 11:47.179
Boop, boop, boop.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.475
Oh, God, I'm so guilty.

11:48.552 --> 11:50.418
I just feel guilt. It's just guilt.

11:50.495 --> 11:52.531
It's crushing, overwhelming
amounts of guilt,

11:52.609 --> 11:54.673
for all the things that
I've done to people lately.

11:54.741 --> 11:56.861
I mean, not even lately,
all the things I've done to people

11:56.929 --> 11:58.062
since I moved here.

11:58.421 --> 12:00.476
And there are things people
don't even know about.

12:00.544 --> 12:01.802
Like what?

12:01.870 --> 12:03.442
Eh, I don't really
want to talk about it.

12:03.510 --> 12:04.523
Does that really matter?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.062
- Kind of, yeah. Yes.
- Of course it does.

12:06.130 --> 12:09.187
Okay, point is, I've done some
not great things to people,

12:09.327 --> 12:13.278
and I think what's killing me
is I always get away with it.

12:13.462 --> 12:14.837
I don't know why.

12:15.093 --> 12:17.250
Is it because I'm
smarter than other people?

12:17.710 --> 12:18.913
Maybe I'm cuter?

12:18.990 --> 12:20.757
Maybe it's 'cause you manipulate people.

12:20.825 --> 12:22.135
Okay, well, stop talking, Rick,

12:22.203 --> 12:24.113
or I'm gonna give your hamachi to Lana.

12:24.996 --> 12:27.614
That proves your point.
Yep. I do that.

12:27.682 --> 12:29.054
You know, if you're feeling guilty,

12:29.122 --> 12:31.703
maybe you could confess
the bad things you've done.

12:31.771 --> 12:32.827
Like recently,

12:32.904 --> 12:35.029
I apologized
to all ten of my children

12:35.106 --> 12:38.085
because I haven't been
that present in their lives,

12:38.164 --> 12:39.656
and I feel a lot better.

12:40.624 --> 12:42.953
Oh, Bert, wow. Confess?

12:43.621 --> 12:46.421
Maybe that would make
the apparitions or ghosts

12:46.521 --> 12:49.859
or memory of Trent...
Whatever it is... go away.

12:50.034 --> 12:51.647
Oof, it's gonna be difficult,

12:51.715 --> 12:54.729
but... okay.
All right, I'm gonna do it.

12:54.797 --> 12:56.914
I'm gonna get it off my chest.
Got it.

12:56.982 --> 12:59.109
So, who called this meeting again?

12:59.178 --> 13:01.539
I don't know.
The subject line says "The Purge,"

13:01.670 --> 13:04.703
so are we throwing up or
watching a horror movie or what?

13:04.863 --> 13:07.541
Oh, good,
you got my Google Cal invite.

13:07.697 --> 13:09.750
Honey, what's this about?

13:09.818 --> 13:12.664
I will tell you. I'll
tell you everything.

13:12.734 --> 13:15.000
We're just waiting on
one more person.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.335
Sorry I'm late.

13:16.403 --> 13:19.242
Someone asked me to change
the water cooler on the way in.

13:19.421 --> 13:20.710
Rebecca,

13:20.914 --> 13:22.372
what is this?

13:23.011 --> 13:26.038
I have some things to say, and...

13:26.576 --> 13:28.101
it's gonna be brutal.

13:39.398 --> 13:41.591
So, during the birth,
in the delivery room,

13:41.668 --> 13:43.721
Valencia will be doing the video.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.562
Hector, snacks, obviously.

13:45.729 --> 13:46.989
Beth, coffee.

13:47.191 --> 13:49.233
Paula, wisdom and ice chips.

13:49.310 --> 13:51.375
And I don't know what
Rebecca is gonna do,

13:51.443 --> 13:52.624
so she can be a floater.

13:52.814 --> 13:54.135
So that's everyone.

13:54.212 --> 13:56.782
Yeah. Okay, actually, no one is gonna be

13:56.859 --> 13:58.718
in the delivery room,
Darryl, just you.

13:58.786 --> 14:00.546
Okay? We're gonna do this how I want.

14:00.614 --> 14:02.554
It might be your baby,
but it's my birth,

14:02.622 --> 14:04.078
and I'm terrified.

14:04.179 --> 14:05.945
I mean, after that
talk with Paula, like,

14:06.013 --> 14:08.109
I'm freaking freaked out.

14:08.386 --> 14:11.248
My downstairs is gonna
look like beef tartare.

14:11.325 --> 14:12.697
But everybody loves you,

14:12.765 --> 14:14.375
and they all want to be
by your side.

14:14.443 --> 14:17.826
Why are you so obsessed with
making this birth a group hang?

14:17.894 --> 14:21.712
It is not a group hang;
I'm just having a few people over.

14:21.974 --> 14:24.669
- What?
- These people are my family,

14:24.746 --> 14:26.507
my support system, my rock.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.024
They love me.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.812
And they love that I
look like Tom Selleck.

14:31.016 --> 14:33.054
And they love making me
oatmeal in the morning.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.576
Oh.

14:34.676 --> 14:36.882
This is about Tom Selleck.

14:37.017 --> 14:39.196
No, I'm kidding. It's about WiJo.

14:39.328 --> 14:40.625
You miss him.

14:40.766 --> 14:42.533
I would've put that
together ages ago,

14:42.601 --> 14:44.093
but I have such major
baby brain.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.498
Did you know that
brains shrink

14:45.575 --> 14:47.421
three to five percent during pregnancy?

14:47.507 --> 14:49.034
I can't remember
who told me that.

14:49.265 --> 14:50.365
Anyway, so,

14:50.442 --> 14:52.605
do you, like, regret
breaking up with WiJo?

14:52.682 --> 14:55.156
Do you want to be with him again?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.828
I don't know.

14:57.449 --> 14:59.335
I just miss my friend.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.625
Oh, Darryl, that's sweet.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.853
And I would love
to talk with you more about this,

15:04.921 --> 15:07.850
but I am having some wicked
Braxton Hicks right now.

15:07.927 --> 15:09.057
Wait, are you okay?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.527
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:10.621 --> 15:12.959
The Braxton Hicks are just the
practice contractions, remember?

15:13.027 --> 15:14.076
Oh.

15:14.144 --> 15:15.966
Oh, ow.

15:16.472 --> 15:18.321
Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.

15:18.389 --> 15:20.566
Bowling ball, bowling ball,
bowling ball, bowling ball.

15:20.643 --> 15:21.726
Oh, does it hurt?

15:21.794 --> 15:23.346
Maybe it's not a practice contraction.

15:23.414 --> 15:24.603
Maybe this is a real one.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.135
No, I don't think so.

15:26.484 --> 15:29.008
I mean, I did see a
bloody clump of mucus fall

15:29.085 --> 15:31.310
into the toilet bowl earlier, but...

15:31.387 --> 15:34.046
Wow. The miracle of birth.

15:34.193 --> 15:35.919
Mm-hmm.

15:36.419 --> 15:38.062
Ha... man.

15:38.286 --> 15:39.849
Is it another Toni Braxton?

15:39.983 --> 15:41.799
Oh, that unbreaks my heart.

15:42.145 --> 15:45.364
Um, no. I'll-I'll let you
know when they get painful.

15:46.184 --> 15:47.366
Oh, it's right now.

15:47.443 --> 15:48.934
- Oh!
- Ah, it's right now.

15:49.011 --> 15:51.154
- Oh!
- Oh... So get the car.

15:51.222 --> 15:52.989
- Get the car right now.
- It's right now. Okay, thank you.

15:53.057 --> 15:55.614
Oh... Toni Braxton.

15:56.317 --> 15:59.825
Oh... Brandy and Monica.

16:00.732 --> 16:02.232
Aaliyah?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.036
Anybody?

16:04.104 --> 16:05.332
All right.

16:05.409 --> 16:06.971
I knew this was gonna be really hard,

16:07.048 --> 16:08.497
so I made some lists.

16:08.739 --> 16:10.433
So, I have one for each of you.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.482
Uh, and basically this is
a-a list of all of the things

16:13.550 --> 16:14.560
that I have done,

16:14.628 --> 16:16.763
that I should have told
you all about, um...

16:16.867 --> 16:18.111
It's bad.

16:18.247 --> 16:20.122
It's-it's... just-just
to warn you, it's bad.

16:20.216 --> 16:21.998
It's, like, really...
it's, like, really bad.

16:22.075 --> 16:25.552
It's bad. So just, uh... look.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.262
You almost had
my Lolo killed?

16:28.339 --> 16:29.686
What's a "Lolo"?

16:29.763 --> 16:31.349
Oh. "Lolo" means grandpa.

16:31.454 --> 16:33.614
You didn't notice I was
going through an abortion?

16:33.682 --> 16:36.708
Oh, oh. I'm s... I'm s... God.
I'm so sorry. Clerical error.

16:36.826 --> 16:39.351
Just, you should have this one,
and you should have that one.

16:39.428 --> 16:40.508
Wow, off to a great start.

16:40.576 --> 16:42.733
Well, mine's obviously
for me, because it says

16:42.810 --> 16:44.966
you put out
a hit on my girlfriend Mona?

16:45.034 --> 16:46.068
Why does it say

16:46.136 --> 16:48.095
"having sex with Greg's dad"?

16:48.220 --> 16:49.507
Ugh.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.254
You had sex with Greg's dad. Right.

16:51.322 --> 16:53.138
No you didn't. No.

16:53.318 --> 16:54.569
No way.

16:54.716 --> 16:56.584
- That's on mine, too.
- Mine, too.

16:56.652 --> 16:58.343
Yeah, um, so I just...

16:58.411 --> 17:00.326
I didn't know what list to put that on.

17:00.403 --> 17:02.122
I just thought everyone should know.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.280
You lied...

17:09.915 --> 17:13.771
about Trent blackmailing me?

17:15.060 --> 17:17.180
You sent me poop?

17:17.641 --> 17:19.733
- Your poop?
- Shut up, Josh.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.440
So-so...

17:23.025 --> 17:25.979
So Trent didn't blackmail me.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.321
And you...

17:28.682 --> 17:32.022
manipulated me and lied to me

17:32.147 --> 17:34.052
to get me to commit federal crimes,

17:34.128 --> 17:35.396
even though I didn't want to?

17:35.464 --> 17:36.492
Sorry, back up.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.107
Someone tried to kill my Lolo?

17:39.244 --> 17:41.084
Ah, that was more me.

17:41.264 --> 17:43.201
I like to think I wasn't
really gonna go through with it,

17:43.269 --> 17:45.170
but whatever; even if I did,
he had a nice long life.

17:45.316 --> 17:46.715
Mona, on the other hand...

17:46.792 --> 17:49.109
This isn't right. This is a mistake.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.021
You promised me so many times

17:52.089 --> 17:54.074
that you wouldn't lie to me anymore.

17:54.142 --> 17:55.615
I trusted you.

17:55.855 --> 17:59.560
I didn't even check on what
you told me about Trent,

17:59.628 --> 18:01.299
because I just believed you.

18:01.367 --> 18:02.948
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.178
I told you.
I told you, it's bad.

18:05.246 --> 18:06.849
It's really, really bad.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.022
And that's why I just,

18:08.090 --> 18:09.607
I wanted to get it out in the open,

18:09.675 --> 18:11.244
and tell you... no.

18:11.312 --> 18:13.353
Paula. Paula.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.747
No, no, no, Paula. Oh, Paula.

18:15.824 --> 18:18.717
Rebecca tried to have
my father deported?

18:20.090 --> 18:22.708
Again, that was me.

18:22.957 --> 18:25.638
But to be fair,
I was promised sex.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.906
Oh, God.

18:31.063 --> 18:33.076
Okay, I deserve that.

18:33.568 --> 18:35.250
I deserve that.

18:36.987 --> 18:38.445
Hey, hey.

18:38.522 --> 18:40.413
I know, I know, it's bad.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.353
- And I am so sorry if I hurt you.
- You're sorry "if"?

18:43.513 --> 18:45.037
I was going through a very tough time.

18:45.105 --> 18:48.031
- I barely remember half those...
- It was last week.

18:48.099 --> 18:49.353
That is true,

18:49.443 --> 18:52.150
but it's not representative
of the person that I really am.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.177
But it obviously is. I mean,
you did it.

18:54.324 --> 18:56.975
I just, I just... I can't believe this.

18:57.263 --> 18:59.450
You have let me down
so many times.

18:59.576 --> 19:01.740
And I am such a fool.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.880
I am a sucker.

19:04.045 --> 19:06.732
You are never going to be
any different.

19:08.762 --> 19:11.381
Oh, forget it! I am taking the stairs.

19:15.982 --> 19:17.925
Oh, God!

19:19.316 --> 19:23.537
Leave me alone, you turtlenecked
manifestation of my guilt.

19:23.614 --> 19:25.224
I did it. I confessed everything.

19:25.292 --> 19:26.553
So you have no reason
to be here anymore.

19:26.621 --> 19:27.828
Leave me alone.

19:27.896 --> 19:29.491
Never, my love.

19:29.739 --> 19:31.387
Okay, seriously?

19:31.534 --> 19:32.784
Go away.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.201
Go away, ghost.

19:35.481 --> 19:37.610
Boo!

19:39.849 --> 19:41.695
Oh, God, you're real.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.404
Trent, what are you doing here?

19:46.481 --> 19:49.897
You said you were leaving.
God, I thought you were in Iowa.

19:49.974 --> 19:51.106
Io-was.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.281
But I missed you,
and now I'm-a-back.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.005
I have unfinished business here.

19:55.116 --> 19:57.492
What? What could it be?
Blackmailing me again?

19:57.569 --> 19:59.523
You can't.
I told everyone everything.

20:00.126 --> 20:04.715
God. Trent, I'm never gonna
be your girlfriend, ever.

20:05.075 --> 20:06.770
So just get that through your head.

20:06.927 --> 20:08.927
Oh, we're way past that.

20:09.294 --> 20:10.981
I know that's never gonna happen.

20:11.165 --> 20:14.685
Now I just want you to feel as
badly as you've made me feel.

20:14.864 --> 20:16.380
So be careful, Rebecca.

20:16.784 --> 20:20.789
Because I'm one scary,
scary, sexy man.

20:22.059 --> 20:23.513
Well, what are you gonna do?

20:23.681 --> 20:26.599
Oh. It's no fun if I tell you.

20:59.185 --> 21:00.601
Hi, Paula. It's Rebecca.

21:00.669 --> 21:02.303
I know we're in a big fight
right now,

21:02.371 --> 21:04.514
but you got to call me
back; it's an emergency.

21:05.334 --> 21:07.741
I saw Trent. I saw him.

21:07.843 --> 21:10.802
He was here at the office,
and I'm really, really scared.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.930
And I'm trying to use
your tracking device,

21:12.998 --> 21:14.172
but I don't know how it works.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.419
So please just give
me a call back, okay?

21:16.487 --> 21:18.084
Call me.

21:19.351 --> 21:20.651
Hi, Paula. It's Rebecca.

21:20.719 --> 21:22.286
I know we're in a big fight 
right now,

21:22.354 --> 21:25.212
but you got to call me back;
it's an emergency.

21:25.289 --> 21:27.725
I saw Trent.
I saw him.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.717
He was here at the office,
and I'm really, really scared.

21:30.785 --> 21:32.828
And I'm trying to use
your tracking device,

21:32.896 --> 21:34.139
but I don't know how it works.

21:34.207 --> 21:37.024
So please just give me a
call back, okay? Call me.

21:37.092 --> 21:40.747
What's wrong with Rebecca?
She sounds really scared.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.367
You gonna call her back?

21:46.141 --> 21:47.675
No, I'm done.

21:51.712 --> 21:53.373
So, what is everybody wearing

21:53.450 --> 21:55.313
to Nathaniel's soiree tonight?

21:55.381 --> 21:56.786
I've got my cocktail suspenders,

21:56.861 --> 21:58.938
I got my lobster pot
suspenders, I've got...

21:59.006 --> 22:00.508
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim.

22:00.675 --> 22:01.929
Rebecca wasn't invited.

22:01.997 --> 22:05.024
Yeah, have you not been reading
the "shhhhh" group text chain?

22:05.092 --> 22:07.087
I wasn't invited to the
party, okay, and I'm fine.

22:07.155 --> 22:09.839
Listen, does anybody here know
anything about spy trackers?

22:10.405 --> 22:11.758
I'm sorry, I-I don't...

22:11.835 --> 22:14.991
- Spy... detector?
- No. Sorry.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.961
That was really awkward turtle.

22:17.041 --> 22:18.860
What's "awkward turtle"?

22:21.226 --> 22:23.039
I don't know what you
need a spy thing for,

22:23.107 --> 22:26.492
but, hey, leave our
Nathaniel alone, okay?

22:26.649 --> 22:29.077
He's happy.
You're dangerous.

22:29.524 --> 22:31.141
You're a loose cannon, Bunch,

22:31.227 --> 22:33.117
and you hurt everyone around you.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.463
Mona?

22:35.978 --> 22:38.789
Mona? Mona?

22:38.904 --> 22:40.195
Mona!

22:40.381 --> 22:42.696
Hey. I was in the shower.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.788
God, I texted you.
I even called.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.484
A voice call? What's wrong?

22:46.568 --> 22:50.861
I just... I just...
I-I was worried about you today

22:50.938 --> 22:53.867
for-for no reason,
regarding nothing and no one.

22:54.403 --> 22:57.267
Oh, Nat, that's weird and cute.

22:57.344 --> 22:59.106
I just needed to see
you, and you're fine.

22:59.183 --> 23:00.297
You were in the shower.

23:00.397 --> 23:02.127
Everything's the way
it's supposed to be.

23:02.205 --> 23:03.957
All right, the party
starts in a couple of hours,

23:04.025 --> 23:05.198
so I have to blow out my hair,

23:05.266 --> 23:07.232
otherwise my secret will be out.

23:07.588 --> 23:08.820
I have curly hair.

23:10.336 --> 23:11.586
Come here.

23:11.703 --> 23:13.398
Mm.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.938
So, it looks like you're
definitely in labor.

23:31.015 --> 23:32.594
Oh, really? Do you think?

23:32.781 --> 23:34.982
No, I know, 'cause I'm a doctor.

23:35.052 --> 23:36.206
Okay.

23:36.283 --> 23:37.778
Now, according to your birth plan,

23:37.855 --> 23:40.734
you want to labor naturally
for as long as possible.

23:40.922 --> 23:43.346
Uh, what does that mean?

23:43.423 --> 23:44.818
It means no pain medication.

23:44.895 --> 23:47.432
Oh, no. Wrong. That's wrong.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.109
Wait, where did you get this, anyways?

23:49.242 --> 23:52.453
What man filled this out?
Because I did not.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.795
Um, I did that for you. I
thought I was helping out.

23:54.872 --> 23:57.197
And I checked "no
early pain intervention"

23:57.274 --> 24:00.102
because I read that
epidurals can slow down labor.

24:00.170 --> 24:02.391
No, it's true. You and I,

24:02.542 --> 24:05.225
we are gonna breathe through
this together, Womb Goddess.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.164
Okay, Doc, look at me. Eyes here.

24:08.332 --> 24:11.133
I want drugs... all of the drugs.

24:11.328 --> 24:13.828
Give them to me now!

24:14.546 --> 24:15.879
Yeah.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.734
Thanks.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.266
I'm early.

24:45.517 --> 24:48.297
And I brought ice, because
there is never enough ice.

24:48.365 --> 24:49.442
Wha...

24:49.510 --> 24:51.211
Also, don't worry,
I talked to Rebecca,

24:51.279 --> 24:53.735
and she is never gonna
bother you again.

24:54.197 --> 24:56.385
I gave her a stern talking-to.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.219
And what happened?
Was she upset?

24:58.287 --> 25:00.329
Why would you care
if she's upset?

25:00.524 --> 25:03.047
After everything she did for
you that you didn't ask for?

25:03.438 --> 25:05.367
Whew, that stupid bitch.

25:05.435 --> 25:06.555
You're right, you're right.

25:06.623 --> 25:09.641
I'm not even thinking
about Rebecca. I don't care.

25:09.985 --> 25:11.651
Now, get your gas
station ice out of here.

25:11.728 --> 25:12.918
You're embarrassing yourself.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.297
Go on.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.478
Nurse? Nurse?

25:22.418 --> 25:24.043
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

25:24.122 --> 25:27.840
I was wondering, who played
Uncle Jesse on Full House?

25:28.140 --> 25:29.889
I think it was John Stamos.

25:30.395 --> 25:31.896
John Stamos. Oh, my God.

25:31.973 --> 25:33.965
My brain has shrunk way
more than 5%.

25:34.042 --> 25:36.067
I used to know everything
about Full House.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.248
Is that all?

25:37.316 --> 25:38.981
Yeah. Thanks.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.302
John Stamos. I'm so sorry.

25:44.134 --> 25:45.783
I saw the nurse coming in.

25:45.851 --> 25:47.658
What's happening? Are you okay?

25:47.726 --> 25:50.610
No. I forgot
who John Stamos was.

25:50.963 --> 25:52.587
I can't believe how calm you are.

25:52.664 --> 25:53.684
On TV shows,

25:53.761 --> 25:55.720
pregnant women, they're always crying

25:55.797 --> 25:58.356
and screaming and punching
their husband in the face.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.153
Yeah, well, those shows
were written by men.

26:00.221 --> 26:02.576
I got an epidural, remember?
I don't feel a thing.

26:02.737 --> 26:04.231
Paula was right, actually.

26:04.309 --> 26:06.309
Birth is beautiful when
you get pain relief,

26:06.377 --> 26:07.873
'cause then you just
do crossword puzzles

26:07.941 --> 26:09.895
and binge watch Top of the Lake.

26:10.846 --> 26:12.658
You don't look like
you're having fun, though.

26:12.751 --> 26:14.192
No, I'm fine.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.112
It's White Josh, huh? You're
still missing that guy.

26:18.908 --> 26:21.075
Yeah, kind of. But I'm okay.

26:21.244 --> 26:22.684
Okay, cool.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.066
Adios to Prince Charming.

27:08.536 --> 27:11.082
If I can't have you,
no one will.

27:11.849 --> 27:13.744
I saw your face when Nathaniel said

27:13.812 --> 27:17.269
he was moving in with Mona;
I know how you feel.

27:17.848 --> 27:20.171
I lost someone I loved. You.

27:20.248 --> 27:21.910
Now you will feel the same.

27:21.978 --> 27:25.863
Nathaniel Plimpton
III must be destroyed.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.496
Hashtag: motive.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.965
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
Nathaniel.

♪♪

27:34.573 --> 27:36.496
The roses have
really come in well this year.

27:36.564 --> 27:38.498
I've actually never noticed
how much of a green thumb...

27:38.566 --> 27:40.023
Sir, there's a problem with the bill.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.738
May I speak with you for a second?

27:41.948 --> 27:43.996
Sure. Excuse me.

27:46.739 --> 27:49.293
♪ ♪

27:52.914 --> 27:54.805
And just right this way.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.412
I-I don't understand.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.918
I thought
everything was taken care of.

27:57.986 --> 28:01.123
Oh, there's just a
couple of little extras.

28:01.191 --> 28:02.589
Here. You can see here.

28:02.657 --> 28:04.631
I just need your approval
on these little extras.

28:04.699 --> 28:08.887
All right? So that's
mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup.

28:09.457 --> 28:11.283
Condiments are extra?

28:11.387 --> 28:13.293
Okay, do you want to be
the one to go out there

28:13.361 --> 28:15.116
and tell them
there's not any ketchup?

28:15.184 --> 28:16.431
I don't want to be that guy.

28:16.508 --> 28:18.858
So just initial all the condiments.

28:21.187 --> 28:23.363
Where are you, Rebecca?

28:23.431 --> 28:25.245
I know you're coming.

28:26.709 --> 28:28.066
I need you to see this.

28:28.134 --> 28:29.266
What?

28:29.343 --> 28:31.379
What? Initial all the condiments.

28:42.215 --> 28:44.392
Where is he?
Where is he? Where is he?

28:44.469 --> 28:46.085
Where is he?

28:49.966 --> 28:51.413
Where's Nathaniel?

28:51.490 --> 28:53.504
Rebecca, I told you to leave him alone!

28:53.572 --> 28:54.965
Shut up, George! I
need to find Nathaniel.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.488
It's so weird that you showed
up tonight, right, Rebecca?

28:57.686 --> 28:59.285
Awkward turtle.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.802
- I think he went over there.
- Okay.

29:06.269 --> 29:08.312
No.

29:08.389 --> 29:09.847
They say love makes you crazy.

29:09.924 --> 29:12.004
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't. Stop.

29:12.121 --> 29:14.613
- Rebecca, I have to pay the bill.
- No!

29:15.826 --> 29:17.125
No!

29:28.169 --> 29:30.089
Man, I killed that.

29:34.322 --> 29:35.988
Hello.

29:45.789 --> 29:48.576
Hey, hey! He was going
to kill Nathaniel.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.045
Okay? He had a knife.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.743
He's the turkey carver.
He had a carving knife.

29:51.820 --> 29:54.449
No, no, no, he wasn't.
He was my ex-boyfriend,

29:54.526 --> 29:56.788
and he was dangerous,
and he's been stalking me.

29:56.865 --> 29:58.432
He was stalking you by going to a party

29:58.500 --> 29:59.901
you were not invited to?

30:00.135 --> 30:01.753
And so you killed him?

30:02.352 --> 30:04.693
Oh, my God, I killed him?
Is he dead?

30:04.770 --> 30:07.295
Well, the cute EMT,
whose name is Rufus,

30:07.372 --> 30:09.801
which is so weird because I
literally love that baby name,

30:09.878 --> 30:12.143
- Oh!
- He said he fell in a swimming pool...

30:12.390 --> 30:14.473
Just missed the diving board.

30:14.628 --> 30:15.849
Oh, thank God.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.909
'Cause I really, I really
didn't mean to kill him.

30:17.986 --> 30:20.175
Okay, Rebecca, stop.
Don't say anything.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.047
Anything you say can be admissible.

30:22.115 --> 30:24.721
Call Paula. Someone call Paula.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.471
But she's not a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer!

30:30.096 --> 30:31.768
Call Paula.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.628
She's in big trouble.

30:36.705 --> 30:37.885
Huge.

30:37.953 --> 30:39.503
Hundo P.

30:45.537 --> 30:46.969
Oh.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.805
What are you doing here?

30:50.882 --> 30:52.811
Heather texted me.
She asked me to come.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.662
- She did?
- Yeah.

30:54.739 --> 30:57.432
Why? I thought you hated babies.

30:57.549 --> 30:59.604
People got to stop
saying that.

30:59.776 --> 31:01.116
She, uh...

31:01.193 --> 31:02.846
She said you wanted to see me.

31:03.332 --> 31:06.028
She also wanted to know who
starred in School of Rock,

31:06.168 --> 31:07.522
"blank Black""

31:07.785 --> 31:09.612
I did want to see you.

31:10.471 --> 31:12.188
I wanted to see my friend.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.565
We're, uh, we're friends?

31:15.682 --> 31:17.133
I thought you didn't want to be.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.573
- I thought you didn't want to be.
- Okay.

31:21.768 --> 31:23.145
I missed you.

31:23.368 --> 31:24.621
Me, too.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.557
I mean, I didn't miss myself,
I missed you.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.292
Yeah, right. Right, right, right.

31:28.463 --> 31:29.605
I got it.

31:31.212 --> 31:34.992
Can I, uh... Can I hold her?

31:35.385 --> 31:37.129
- You want to?
- Yeah.

31:37.206 --> 31:38.722
Okay.

31:39.626 --> 31:41.721
- Now, just support her head.
- All right.

31:41.789 --> 31:43.370
Aw.

31:43.832 --> 31:45.520
Oh, God, okay.

31:45.588 --> 31:47.964
Okay. I named her Hebecca.

31:48.822 --> 31:51.042
It's a combination of
Heather and Rebecca.

31:52.821 --> 31:55.135
Oh. Mm-hmm.

31:55.260 --> 31:56.280
- Yeah?
- Okay.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.260
Well, they said I had 24
hours if I wanted to change it.

31:58.328 --> 31:59.677
Oh, thank God.

32:01.365 --> 32:02.793
- It is a bad name.
- Really?

32:02.861 --> 32:04.878
Objectively just very bad.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.612
She's perfect.

32:08.979 --> 32:10.355
You did good.

32:10.486 --> 32:11.647
Yeah.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.917
I think we all did.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.181
Hello there.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.572
Is he gonna pull through?

32:27.649 --> 32:30.555
Yeah. Broke every bone
in his body, though.

32:30.623 --> 32:32.127
When you hit a pool from that height,

32:32.197 --> 32:33.558
it's like getting hit by a bus.

32:33.635 --> 32:35.615
He's gonna be in a full-body
cast for quite some time.

32:35.683 --> 32:36.941
Oh, my God.

32:37.439 --> 32:39.053
So, um...

32:39.581 --> 32:42.299
they're gonna charge you with
attempted second-degree murder.

32:42.376 --> 32:45.084
What?! No! No. Hey,
I was saving your life.

32:45.377 --> 32:47.379
Trent has been stalking
me and blackmailing me

32:47.456 --> 32:48.701
practically since the second we met,

32:48.769 --> 32:49.990
and he was trying to hurt you.

32:50.058 --> 32:52.100
- I know. I believe you.
- You believe me?!

32:52.168 --> 32:54.516
Yes, I do, but I don't
know if anyone else will.

32:54.676 --> 32:56.014
To the cops and a jury,

32:56.082 --> 32:58.211
it looks like you crashed
your ex-boyfriend's party,

32:58.398 --> 33:01.184
and then pushed another
ex-boyfriend off of the roof,

33:01.252 --> 33:03.435
who was working there
completely legally as a waiter.

33:03.512 --> 33:05.333
No, uh-uh-uh, but
I told the cops

33:05.410 --> 33:06.972
that he sent me those Instagram stories.

33:07.049 --> 33:09.007
I had to. Yes, but they
already disappeared.

33:09.084 --> 33:10.826
We couldn't find anything.

33:19.109 --> 33:21.080
I'm going to prison.

33:22.706 --> 33:24.197
For a long time.

33:24.265 --> 33:26.594
Maybe not. I have a plan.

33:26.664 --> 33:28.169
You have a plan?

33:29.501 --> 33:31.387
Wait, are you representing me?

33:31.800 --> 33:34.385
After what I almost did to Mona?
Why?

33:34.453 --> 33:37.528
I don't know, honestly.
I can't explain why I'm here.

33:37.596 --> 33:39.013
I can't explain why
I'm going to help you.

33:39.081 --> 33:41.330
I can't explain why I
just broke up with Mona.

33:42.082 --> 33:43.246
What?

33:43.448 --> 33:46.046
Yeah. I don't love her.

33:46.479 --> 33:47.889
I love someone else.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.090
Oh, God, there's another girl?

33:52.009 --> 33:53.308
Me, you're talking about me.

33:53.376 --> 33:54.682
Yeah.

33:54.759 --> 33:56.846
And I think you love me, too.

33:58.869 --> 34:00.355
Nathaniel, of course I do.

34:00.432 --> 34:02.690
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here,

34:02.767 --> 34:04.356
and we're gonna be together, all right?

34:04.424 --> 34:06.252
Okay. There's just one
thing you have to do.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.428
The next hearing

34:07.505 --> 34:08.985
is about entering your plea.

34:09.117 --> 34:11.012
And I want you to plead
not guilty...

34:11.080 --> 34:13.141
- Okay, not guilty.
- by reason of insanity.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.908
- Plead insanity?
- Mm.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.399
You want me to plead insanity?

34:25.476 --> 34:26.681
Yes, think about it.
It'll work.

34:26.750 --> 34:28.551
To a judge,
it'll make absolute sense.

34:28.619 --> 34:30.465
You have a history
of mental instability,

34:30.533 --> 34:33.674
you've been in an institution
before, you have BPD.

34:33.742 --> 34:34.936
None of this is your fault.

34:35.022 --> 34:36.848
No... No, but I put you in danger.

34:36.925 --> 34:38.838
I brought Trent into your life.
He tried to hurt you.

34:38.906 --> 34:40.166
It is my fault.

34:40.266 --> 34:41.465
No, it's not.

34:41.533 --> 34:43.554
You-you don't deserve
blame for any of this

34:43.630 --> 34:44.885
or what led to this.

34:44.962 --> 34:46.489
You've had a really
tough time in your life.

34:46.567 --> 34:49.494
We all have. You've
shown me that I have, too.

34:49.964 --> 34:51.214
What do you mean?

34:51.283 --> 34:52.732
Take me for example.

34:52.917 --> 34:56.143
I have issues with my father.
I have issues with my mother.

34:56.277 --> 34:58.232
Those things made me
kind of a jerk.

34:58.309 --> 34:59.541
You helped me realize that.

34:59.609 --> 35:00.814
You helped me to see that
sometimes

35:00.882 --> 35:02.650
we can't control how we act.

Look, Rebecca, all you have to do now

38:37.331 --> 38:39.383
is plead not guilty
by reason of insanity.

38:39.473 --> 38:40.633
It's that's simple.

38:40.832 --> 38:43.441
Okay. Okay.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.933
Hey. You can do this.

38:48.454 --> 38:49.796
All rise.

38:54.912 --> 38:56.598
You may be seated.

38:56.900 --> 39:00.651
This is Criminal Case Number 15-4270,

39:00.719 --> 39:04.446
The People of Los Angeles
County v. Rebecca Nora Bunch.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.698
Miss Bunch, how do you plead?

39:11.195 --> 39:15.350
Your Honor, I plead not
guilty by reason of...

39:16.139 --> 39:18.406
♪ ♪

39:32.469 --> 39:34.716
By reason of, um...

39:34.793 --> 39:36.856
Insanity.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.475
Wow, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

39:42.758 --> 39:46.848
I may have borderline,
but I'm not insane.

39:48.697 --> 39:51.751
I'm responsible for everything
that happened, all of it.

39:55.512 --> 39:57.134
As long as I can remember,

39:57.211 --> 39:59.968
I've let some other
force control my life.

40:01.729 --> 40:03.796
My mother told me who to be.

40:04.949 --> 40:07.437
Love told me where to go.

40:08.559 --> 40:10.047
And I went along with it all

40:10.124 --> 40:13.945
because I told myself that
they weren't my choices.

40:14.812 --> 40:17.821
That somehow the choices
were being made for me.

40:19.696 --> 40:23.623
But that's just not true.
They were my choices.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.759
It's my life, and I'm responsible

40:25.836 --> 40:29.233
no matter what illness I have
or what my parents were like.

40:29.310 --> 40:31.393
And let's be clear, they suck.

40:36.884 --> 40:38.922
I didn't mean to hurt Trent.

40:40.751 --> 40:42.594
But I did hurt him.

40:44.005 --> 40:46.116
And I want to face the consequences

40:46.193 --> 40:49.954
of what happened on that roof,
and of everything in my life.

40:52.963 --> 40:54.492
I have to.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.557
I'm so sorry.

41:02.234 --> 41:05.155
I want to change, Paula.

41:06.655 --> 41:08.714
And I swear, I'm gonna try.

41:10.263 --> 41:11.941
You don't have to believe me.

41:13.266 --> 41:15.055
I mean, I wouldn't if I were you.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.970
I've broken so many promises.

41:18.680 --> 41:21.359
But I hope that this time
is gonna be different,

41:23.226 --> 41:25.038
because this time

41:25.845 --> 41:29.133
I truly want to be held
responsible for my actions.

41:31.517 --> 41:33.846
So I plead responsible.

41:35.162 --> 41:38.890
I mean... guilty.

41:44.468 --> 41:45.867
I plead guilty.
