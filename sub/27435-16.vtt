Well, in that same post,

11:20.180 --> 11:23.479
she shared a link to
a website for G-A-R-T.

It's a support group
for "gambling, addiction,
recovery, and therapy."

to her credit cards.

It's okay. We're working
on the same case.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.094
Could she be connected to
Morris through poker sites?

Well, I haven't found
an online identity

Every word.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.428
There's no more debt.
But how?

19:35.470 --> 19:37.734
We're gonna be able to
pay off all of our loans.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.330
And we... We can start over.
We'll go somewhere else.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.177
We'll go somewhere warm.
Keen, heads up.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.973
We got a White male

What have you done?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.609

I went over the manifest,

to hear it, Don,

20:21.050 --> 20:22.540
but I'm in the middle
of a big briefing here.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.639
Dead or alive,
everyone's accounted for.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.681
Except one.
Then you need me because?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.551
Because that one person
doesn't exist

20:28.590 --> 20:30.182
before buying a ticket
for that ferry.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.958
it exists only after
she bought that ticket,
not before.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.389
Seriously, I am in a room
full of people

20:40.440 --> 20:42.032
waiting on me to give
a threat assessment.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.436
It's important, M].
I need your help.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.835
It's also off-book,

20:45.870 --> 20:47.508
so I'm gonna have to
farm out the legwork.

20:47.540 --> 20:50.407
IfI send you what I have,
can you do the due diligence
for me?

20:50.450 --> 20:55.342
It's gonna cost me,
but for you,
Crimea can wait.

to go to a hospital.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.996
Look, I don't know
how to find her.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.567
Because she came to you.
Yes! At the house.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.534
I mean, it was like
she was studying me.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.060
She... She had
all kinds of information.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.408
LIZ: What kind
of information?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.328
HENRY: Everything...
How many months'
rent I owed,

21:19.370 --> 21:21.577
how much I lost that night
in Atlantic City.

21:21.610 --> 21:22.872
NED: She knew
my favorite teams.

21:22.910 --> 21:24.400
She knew how much I owed.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.839
She said that she could make
all that debt go away.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.110
LIZ: How?
What exactly did she say?

21:29.150 --> 21:33.917
That, uh, my gambling
had become a cancer
on the people I love.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.485
She said that I needed
to start over.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.522
What does that mean?
Start over how?

21:38.560 --> 21:40.084
_ HENRY:
By domg her a favor.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.463
She asked me to...
Take care of someone for her.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.468
And by "taking care of"
someone,

21:45.500 --> 21:47.468
you mean drowning Betsy Nagel
in her bathtub?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.639
Well, it was supposed to
look like something else,

21:49.670 --> 21:51.228
like a robbery.

21:51.270 --> 21:54.068
A gunshot in broad daylight
wasn't exactly subtle, Ned.

21:54.110 --> 21:55.805
I'm guessing she didn't
sign off on that.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.104
HENRY: Look,
I may never get out
of jail for what I've done,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.902
but I did it
to help my family.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.714
And if I was
smart enough,

22:02.750 --> 22:04.547
I would've got away
With it, too.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.753
LIZ: Henry, you were never
gonna get away with it.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.917
Because you were always
gonna be her next victim.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.321
What do you mean,
"her next victim"?

22:13.360 --> 22:15.328
It's gamblers
killing gamblers.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.089
Lady Luck
identifies her target,

22:17.130 --> 22:19.018
someone Who has a significant
amount of debt,

22:19.070 --> 22:21.664
to be her hitman,
and then she offers to
pay off that debt

22:21.700 --> 22:23.463
in exchange
for the killing.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.331
But What the killer
doesn't know is that
he's the next victim.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.928
Like Betsy Nagel?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.278
Turns out, she'd been bleeding
her sister dry for years

22:30.310 --> 22:31.800
to pay off
her gambling debt.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.670
I spoke to the sister,
and she said that Betsy

22:33.720 --> 22:35.676
showed up last month,
paid her back,

22:35.720 --> 22:38.644
paid her mortgage,
and a half-dozen
maxed-out credit cards.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.011
Using money she'd gotten
for killing a gambler.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.914
And Miss Nagel
is not alone.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.326
I looked into
suspicious deaths
of known gamblers

22:45.360 --> 22:49.228
Who squared debts
shortly before dying,
and get this...

22:49.730 --> 22:51.266
Janice Deavers,

22:51.300 --> 22:54.133
a gunshot wound to the chest
off the Vegas Strip.

22:54.170 --> 22:58.209
Jeff Warner, stabbed to death
in the parking lot
of a casino in Connecticut.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.468
And there are more.

22:59.510 --> 23:02.809
So Lady Luck's
outsourcing her kills.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.808
But Why spend all this money
on bribing gamblers?

23:04.850 --> 23:06.044
Why not kill them herself?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.514
Where's the bribe money
coming from to begin With?

23:08.550 --> 23:11.519
I don't know, but her
cash supply seems endless.

23:11.550 --> 23:14.883
Which means she won't stop.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.423

have the power of flight.

of apprehension and doubt,

29:06.540 --> 29:10.203

you can fly.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.243
It's a dream of
freedom and bliss.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.344
The opposite
of a falling dream,

29:20.390 --> 29:23.928

of fear and anxiety, panic.

a very, very sad story.

Miss Tyche was an upstanding
citizen of her community,

a lifelong gambler,
Lou Tyche.

31:14.670 --> 31:19.039
In 1986, Lou bought a lottery
ticket and won $87 million,

largest jackpot
in Delaware history.

I remember this story.
There was a child.

31:24.050 --> 31:27.201
Second child being born.
It was a long, intense labor.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.377
Lou waited in the hospital,
but at one point,

31:29.420 --> 31:32.048
he left With her son to make
a run to a convenience store

31:32.090 --> 31:33.341
and bought
a lottery ticket.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.210

was badly injured.

was a Winner.

that Agathe was giving
birth to her daughter,

her son was dying
three floors away

31:43.560 --> 31:45.323
While her husband
was in surgery.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.122
The ticket was returned
to her by a medic

Who found it
in her husband's effects.

Well, we understand your

Yeah. Decades ago. My mom
gave all that money away.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.964
Why would she do that?

32:22.570 --> 32:24.868
Because the day he won

32:24.910 --> 32:26.605
was the day that
he got in a car accident

32:26.640 --> 32:28.904
that killed my brother
and paralyzed my father.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.377

39:00.470 --> 39:03.268
The lady that got me to
do this, this Lady Luck,

39:03.300 --> 39:05.006
I'll tell you anything
you want to know about her.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.132
That's good, Henry.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.479
But right now, I'm not
interested in Lady Luck.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.478
First, I want you to tell me
everything you know

39:10.510 --> 39:13.343
about a group called
the Third Estate.

39:13.380 --> 39:17.976
* Can't you see
you belong to me?

39:18.020 --> 39:21.239
Red was right. Henry Morris is
connected to the Third Estate.

39:21.290 --> 39:23.349
He gave them state-of-the-art
surveillance equipment

39:23.390 --> 39:25.779
so they could penetrate
high-end security systems

39:25.830 --> 39:27.752
in private homes.
Did he give you a name?

39:27.790 --> 39:29.599
No, they contracted
through encrypted

39:29.630 --> 39:31.052
Wire transfers
and dead-drops.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.389
But think about it.
The Third Estate is the 99%.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.658
If they're plotting
against America, where else

39:37.700 --> 39:39.861
are they gonna start
than by attacking the 1%?

39:39.910 --> 39:41.639
Yeah, but it's
a pretty big target.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.649
Yeah, well, it's 99% smaller
than it was a few minutes ago.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.840
I'm gonna go tell Cooper.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.905
Keen, hang on a minute.
Uh...

39:47.950 --> 39:51.113
* Every move you make
Every step you take

39:51.150 --> 39:52.378
(SIGHS)

39:52.420 --> 39:54.809
By the way...

39:54.860 --> 39:57.181
I'm sorry
I snapped at you before.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.551
You've been on Reddington's
case longer than any of us,

40:01.600 --> 40:04.319
and you deserve to know
Who he really is.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.163
I owe you one
for letting it go.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.263
Aanay, What is it?

40:15.480 --> 40:18.131
It can wait.
Let's go see Cooper.

40:18.180 --> 40:20.501
* Every vow you break

40:20.550 --> 40:22.177
* Every smile you fake

40:22.220 --> 40:24.541
(TRAIN HORN BLOWS)
* I'll be watching you

40:24.590 --> 40:26.717
* Every single day

40:26.750 --> 40:28.809
* Every word you say

40:28.860 --> 40:31.010
* Every game you play

40:31.060 --> 40:32.755
* Every night you stay

40:32.790 --> 40:35.054
* Every breath you take

40:35.100 --> 40:37.159
* Every move you make

40:37.200 --> 40:43.469
* Every step you take

40:45.140 --> 40:49.804
* I'll be watching you *

40:52.950 --> 40:55.373
(APPLAUSE)

40:57.720 --> 40:59.779
But it was the wrong
example to make.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.617
**

41:05.290 --> 41:07.053
Someone betrayed me.

41:08.630 --> 41:10.552
Someone turned me in
to the police.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.797
Yes. But you don't think
it was Smokey.

41:13.830 --> 41:15.229
No.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.630
But anyone
Who may know Who did,

41:18.670 --> 41:20.729
I want them
to come forward
and tell me

41:20.770 --> 41:22.601
before more people die.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.245
That's Who
the example is for?

41:25.280 --> 41:27.248
The people who know
Who turned you in?

41:28.410 --> 41:30.878
If you knew the truth,
would you come forward

41:30.920 --> 41:32.649
to stop me
from taking a life?

41:35.420 --> 41:37.980
Of course.
Well, then.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.750
I can only hope that anyone
Who actually knows

41:40.790 --> 41:42.929
is as principled as you.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.599
(LAUGHTER IN AUDIENCE,
INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

41:45.630 --> 41:48.121
**

41:56.480 --> 41:58.300
Hi, Dad.
Remember me?

41:58.340 --> 41:59.773
(GASPING)

41:59.810 --> 42:02.017
It's your baby, Moira.

42:02.050 --> 42:03.574
(GASPING)

42:03.620 --> 42:06.009
I don't know if Mom told you.

42:06.050 --> 42:07.642
But it's your lucky day.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.859
I'm gonna be taking over
the family business.

42:11.890 --> 42:14.358
(GASPING)

42:14.390 --> 42:16.824
(WHEEZING)

42:22.640 --> 42:25.029
