WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:08.465
(indistinct voices)

00:08.500 --> 00:11.503
DIANE (distant): The evidence
does not support the finding

00:11.540 --> 00:14.338
that my client is guilty
of premeditated murder.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.575
(clearly):
Alicia? Alicia?

00:16.610 --> 00:18.248
Alicia?

00:20.480 --> 00:21.742
Your Honor, the
trial is over.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.645
The jury has heard the evidence.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.578
The arguments
now are purely about

00:25.620 --> 00:27.679
your jury instructions,
that's all...

00:27.720 --> 00:29.381
And that's what we're arguing,
Your Honor...
Mr. Agos?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.682
I know that interruption is a
standard trope of today's modern

00:31.730 --> 00:34.290
discourse, but do you happen to
remember what I said about it?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.093
You said you didn't like it.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.563
Yes. If you did it again?

00:37.600 --> 00:39.363
I was gonna have to go sit down.
That's right.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.298
DIANE:
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.262
The prosecution worries
they failed to make

00:42.310 --> 00:43.607
their case for
first-degree murder.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.834
We sympathize.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.407
We don't think they made
their case, either.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.407
Our client

00:48.440 --> 00:49.748
is innocent.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.441
Officer Fisher
didn't kill her husband.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.141
She didn't take
her serwce revolver

00:53.180 --> 00:55.239
and shoot him in the head.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.078
Yes, I see your hand, Counselor.
Are you finished, Ms. Lockhart?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.758
Why yes, I am, Your Honor.

00:59.790 --> 01:00.757
The defense is forcing

01:00.790 --> 01:04.328
the jury into an all-or-nothing
deliberation--

01:04.360 --> 01:05.850
first-degree murder
or not guilty.

01:05.890 --> 01:08.199
You're the ones who fought the
all-or-nothing prosecution...

01:08.230 --> 01:09.367
Mr. Coyne.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.494
DANA:
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.236
The evidence at trial is what
should guide your decision.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.363
(cell phone hums)
The jury heard evidence

01:17.410 --> 01:19.605
from which they could reasonably
conclude that the elements

01:19.640 --> 01:23.542
of second-degree murder
have not been met...
Ms. Venegas. Yes.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.207
Yes, I received
your message, ma'am.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.309
I'm so sorry, but we can't
accommodate you.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.478
We limit enrollment
to the beginning of the year.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.385
I understand. It's just...
(clears throat)

01:32.420 --> 01:33.887
I know occasionally you make
exceptions.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.012
For legacy students, yes.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.278
My children were students
at your elementary school

01:37.330 --> 01:38.228
before my husband and I
moved away.

01:38.260 --> 01:41.423
He's the new State's Attorney,
you know.

01:41.460 --> 01:44.258
Oh, Peter Florrick?

01:44.300 --> 01:45.699
I wasn't making the connection.

01:45.730 --> 01:51.236
Yes, and he would be thrilled
if we could work this out.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.409
Let's just meet to discuss.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.579
Certainly. But you understand
I can't make any promises.

01:55.610 --> 01:58.477
Oh, yes, I understand.
Uh, does tomorrow at 10:00 work?

01:58.510 --> 01:59.545
Hmm!
Great!

01:59.580 --> 02:02.845
Thank you so much, Ms. Venegas.
I'll see you then.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.517
(phone beeps)

02:06.390 --> 02:08.187
Peter, hi.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.529
I set up a meeting with
the headmistress at Capstone.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.790
Really? I thought they said no.
They did, but they're open

02:12.830 --> 02:16.698
to a meeting, and it wouldn't
hurt if you gave them a call.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.220
She seemed... persuadable.

02:18.270 --> 02:20.488
When is the meeting?
Uh, it's tomorrow at 10:00,
but you don't have to go.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.758
I'll go.
Okay.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.607
Uh, tomorrow at 10:00.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.404
And, um... I think she liked the
State's Attorney thing, so...

02:27.440 --> 02:29.374
I'll play it up. Okay?

02:29.410 --> 02:31.605
All right, bye.

02:31.650 --> 02:32.844
What happened?

02:32.880 --> 02:34.848
The judge won't instruct
on second-degree murder.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.848
It's Judge Dunaway.
You said he leaned
toward the prosecution.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.859
He used to.
Where's the jury on this?

02:39.890 --> 02:41.414
I don't think we convinced
them of first degree.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.587
You agree?
I think the jury likes her.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.427
I don't think we made the sale
on premeditatlon.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.224
So, why didn't we?
We had a witness
that fell through.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.399
And some of the motions...
they just didn't go our way.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.239
Make the deal.

02:58.270 --> 03:00.477
They'll want manslaughter.

03:00.510 --> 03:03.741
Manslaughter, no.
Second degree, four years.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.876
Where the hell are
all the tough-on-crime
judges these days?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.889
Mr. Gardner.
One second.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.329
I don't want things
to be awkward.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.429
I so don't want
things to be awkward.

03:26.470 --> 03:28.290
Good. Then they won't be.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.476
So, that's it
then, isn't it?

03:32.510 --> 03:34.307
What?

03:34.340 --> 03:36.274
We just decide it,
and it's so?

03:36.310 --> 03:37.777
Yep. We're adults.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.346
DIANE:
Alicia?

03:39.380 --> 03:41.473
Looks like you're needed.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.817
Then I'll get back to work.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.715
Thank you.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.389
You have no reason
to thank me, AIICIa.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.580
No reason at all.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.557
ASSISTANT:
I have these discovery documents

03:53.600 --> 03:54.794
for you to go over...

03:58.570 --> 03:59.696
Well fought, Cary.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.037
You've become quite
the litigator.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.503
(over speakerphone):
Thank you, Diane.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.667
We try to keep you guys honest.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.768
So, we have an offer.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.598
We probably should hurry,
or the jury will be in soon.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.606
Second degree, four years.

04:11.650 --> 04:14.710
(mouthing)

04:14.750 --> 04:17.548
Diane, you still there?

04:17.590 --> 04:18.545
Uh, yes, I'm here.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.319
We're just thinking it over.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.452
COYNE:
We'll take it to our client.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.583
But she'll be much more inclined
if you offer probation.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.585
It's not going
to be probation.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.757
She killed her husband for
the insurance money.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.552
He committed suicide.
Come on, he committed suicide

04:28.600 --> 04:30.090
with her service
revolver. . .?!

04:30.130 --> 04:32.598
Too bad you couldn't shake
the alibi.
Okay, let's not
go over this again.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.369
We'll, uh, we'll take it
to our client, Cary.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.992
That's all we can say.
Okay, do.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.429
Just know you're not getting any
better than this, okay, Diane?

04:38.470 --> 04:39.437
Bye.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.572
Yes!
Yes!

04:40.610 --> 04:42.771
Oh!
Oh, well done!

04:44.050 --> 04:46.416
They're offering
second-degree murder.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.747
Four years.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.747
Four years?

04:48.780 --> 04:50.088
COYNE:
The statutory minimum.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.417
You'll be out in one.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.509
It's good news, Lauryn.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.017
They're worried about
their case; that's why
they're making an offer.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.584
So I should wait
for a verdict?

04:57.630 --> 05:01.418
I don't know.
Juries are unpredictable.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.690
You're not saying much.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.698
I don't have much to say.

05:05.730 --> 05:06.936
Well, what should I do?

05:06.970 --> 05:09.803
A year in prison or roll
the dice with a verdict?

05:11.710 --> 05:15.339
I think... that you need to make
that decision, Lauryn.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.677
You can't defer to anyone else.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.713
You know what you did;
you know what you didn't do.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.412
You also know sometimes
that doesn't matter.

05:22.450 --> 05:25.715
It comes down to two things:
The skill of your lawyers,

05:25.750 --> 05:27.615
and the jury.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.059
You have good lawyers.

05:29.090 --> 05:33.629
The trial went our way,
but the jury...

05:33.660 --> 05:35.525
is an unknown.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.721
They're your peers.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.661
And I've never understood
my peers.

05:46.510 --> 05:49.479
I didn't do this.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.546
That's why I'm going to pass
on this deal.

05:51.580 --> 05:56.745
I can't spend another
day in prison for
something I didn't do.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.644
I'll roll the dice.
Okay.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.681
Then we sit and wait
for the jury.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.054
(cell door clangs in distance)

06:05.090 --> 06:06.955
Oh, yeah, I talked
with that headmistress.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.797
She's a real piece of work.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.388
(laughs):
Yeah.
(sighs)

06:10.430 --> 06:11.692
So, we'll split the cost.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.595
No, I've got it.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.837
We're going to split the cost
of private school, Alicia.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.929
That's non-negotiable.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.938
Okay, thanks.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.675
Where are we at with Grace?

06:22.710 --> 06:24.769
No TV, no computer
except homework.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.675
No calls except to us.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.073
And no calling Jimmy Patrick.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.985
That's that Christian kid
she was with?

06:30.020 --> 06:32.147
Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.

06:32.190 --> 06:34.715
Oh, no, no, no,
I'll talk to him.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.715
Nqum

06:35.760 --> 06:37.728
I'm just bringing my
computer for my homework.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.125
Dad is keeping track.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.957
Yeah, and Dad's
a lot meaner than Mom.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.161
Dad, do I get to drive?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.566
Call me on your way
to school tomorrow.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.760
GRACE: Okay.
ZACH:
Love you.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.461
Love you.
See ya.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.708
(vacuum humming)

07:08.760 --> 07:11.558
ANNOUNCER:
Joan of Arc,
as only cable can tell it.

07:11.590 --> 07:14.627
(man and woman moaning
passionately)

07:14.660 --> 07:16.821
MAN:
If only the Armagnacs
and the Burgundians

07:16.870 --> 07:18.758
would unite under
one leadership.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.598
WOMAN: Does monsieur want me
to wash between the legs?
Oui.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.837
But then there's Burgundy, and
this insufferable peace treat...

07:24.870 --> 07:27.077
Hi, it's me.

07:28.810 --> 07:32.576
I know I shouldn't have
called...

07:32.620 --> 07:34.713
Are you sure?
It's not too late?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.514
* They say

07:39.560 --> 07:42.211
* I'm better off
any other way... *

07:44.130 --> 07:45.882
Hey, sis.

07:45.930 --> 07:48.694
You're lonely.
That's the problem.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.789
I'm lonely.
I know I'm lonely.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.798
So go call him.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.990
VVho?
Will.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.532
Owen, you're not listening
to me.

07:58.570 --> 07:59.969
I have kids.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.807
You don't have kids.
They're with Peter.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.876
What?

08:03.910 --> 08:06.845
Do you suddenly become a
non-sexual person just
because you have kids?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.848
No. I am a parent.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.713
And I have to stop being
irresponsible.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.581
How are you being
irresponsible?

08:13.620 --> 08:14.609
I'm married.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.718
Then get divorced.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.557
You're not Catholic.

08:17.590 --> 08:19.251
Nobody's gonna
send you to hell.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.293
Are you in love
with Will?

08:22.330 --> 08:23.763
No, I don't think I am.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.028
Seriously?

08:25.070 --> 08:26.890
Seriously.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.295
I think I was in love with "it."

08:29.340 --> 08:31.103
You know, the attention.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.835
The... _
Raw, animallstlc sex?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.030
Yeah.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.870
But... I didn't like the lying.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.549
And I... and I don't like...
I mean, he's my boss.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.546
Then quit.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.581
I don't mean quit working.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.020
I mean, quit that job.
Get another one.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.655
It's too complicated.
I don't like complications.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.223
I need friends.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.831
Then get friends.
You-you had good friends.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.964
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.329
Where are they all?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.008
Probably on Facebook.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.703
What about... try that tennis
woman, what was her name?

09:10.750 --> 09:13.844
It was like a governmental
agency... FEMA?

09:13.880 --> 09:15.814
(chuckles)

09:15.850 --> 09:18.011
Senna.

09:18.050 --> 09:20.257
She was nice,
wasn't she?
(cell phone buzzing)

09:20.290 --> 09:21.917
Uh-oh.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.656
Oh, this can't be good.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.851
Hello.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.049
Now?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.898
JUDGE:
I'd like to thank the jury
for their diligence

09:30.930 --> 09:32.989
and insisting on staying
past dinner.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.860
I understand we have a verdict.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.162
FOREMAN:
We do, Your Honor.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.748
JUDGE:
Mr. Foreman,
you may read the verdict.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.848
FOREMAN:
We, the jury,
find the defendant,

09:47.880 --> 09:52.317
Lauryn Fisher, guilty of
murder in the first degree.

09:52.350 --> 09:54.750
(gallery murmuring)
No.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.257
Get Kalinda;
she's on her way in.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.349
Yeah.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.323
Kalinda, it's guilty.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.067
Your Honor, we ask...

10:11.110 --> 10:13.032
Would you like me
to poll the jury?
Yes, Your Honor.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.401
JUDGE:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, the defense

10:15.440 --> 10:19.103
would like to make certain that
all members of the jury

10:19.150 --> 10:22.347
support this verdict, so I will
ask you one at a time

10:22.380 --> 10:23.916
for your individual verdicts.

10:23.950 --> 10:25.315
This isn't over, Lauryn,
not by a long shot.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.284
JUDGE:
Juror number one,
what is your verdict?

10:27.320 --> 10:29.982
Guilty.
Actually, sir,

10:30.030 --> 10:32.999
you have to say, "Guilty of
murder in the first degree."

10:33.030 --> 10:34.657
Sorry.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.827
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.121
JUDGE:
Juror number two,
what is your verdict?

10:38.170 --> 10:40.138
WOMAN:
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.229
Juror number three,
what is your verdict?

10:42.270 --> 10:43.908
MAN:
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.999
Juror number four,
what is your verdict?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.735
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.179
Juror number five,
what is your verdict?

10:53.080 --> 10:54.718
I...

10:56.250 --> 10:59.754
Guilty of murder...
in the first degree.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.156
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:02.190 --> 11:03.418
Juror number six,
what is your verdict?

11:03.460 --> 11:07.191
JURORS (overlapping):
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.095
Juror number 12,

11:09.130 --> 11:10.199
what is your verdict?

11:10.230 --> 11:12.118
(congested):
Not guilty of...

11:13.140 --> 11:14.937
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.369
(clears throat)

11:16.400 --> 11:17.901
JUDGE:
Well, thank you, jurors,
that ends your service.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.908
We will reconvene
on Friday for sentencmg.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.373
Good night.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.378
The judge is not happy.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.002
I know, we may
have an opening.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.244
Lauryn, this
isn't over yet.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.918
We can try and get
this overturned.

11:27.950 --> 11:30.783
Or a mistrial or a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.014
I've never seen
anything lIke It.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.119
That verdict
doesn't make sense.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.309
Something happened
in the jury room.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.509
I got to get moving.
Right.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.983
We want a reversal, something
before sentencing on Friday.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.055
We have
a sympathetic judge.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.897
All right, let's find out
what went wrong.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.169
Thanks, Brad.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.211
It will be put
to good use.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.786
ALICIA:
Sorry to bother you.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.297
You might recognize me
from the defense.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.228
Yes.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.251
It really helps us evaluate
our performance

12:16.300 --> 12:17.528
to hear from the jurors

12:17.570 --> 12:19.492
what they think we did
right and wrong,

12:19.530 --> 12:20.895
so if you don't mind talking...

12:20.940 --> 12:21.736
I don't think I'm supposed to.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.465
Oh, no, that's just
during the trial.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.137
You have the right
to say anything you want

12:25.170 --> 12:26.137
after the verdict.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.273
This isn't over.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.242
What's not?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.178
They're out
talking to jurors.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.178
They're going for a reversal.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.244
Or judgment notwithstanding.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.219
It's just
kind of late.
I understand.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.445
and I'll call you
tomorrow?

12:39.490 --> 12:40.252
Ten minutes tops.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.850
CARY: You don't have
to talk to her.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.323
He's well within
his rights, Cary.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.282
I've explained
it to him.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.251
Yes, but have you explained

12:47.300 --> 12:49.393
that he doesn't have
to talk to you at all?

12:49.430 --> 12:51.819
Just so you know, sir,
defense attorneys will try

12:51.870 --> 12:53.497
and contact you and question you
in an attempt

12:53.540 --> 12:54.495
to compromise
your verdict.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.132
I'm doing nothing
wrong, Cary.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.808
Here's my number if they do.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.899
You can bring them up
on charges of harassment.

13:01.410 --> 13:04.174
DANA: What are you
doing there, Kalinda?

13:04.210 --> 13:04.949
How are you, Dana?

13:04.980 --> 13:07.448
I was just enjoying
the night air.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.141
It looked to me_like
you were taking pictures

13:09.180 --> 13:10.147
of the jurors'
license plates.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.145
Really?

13:11.190 --> 13:12.384
Ithought
I was taking notes

13:12.420 --> 13:14.217
that are both
legally obtainable

13:14.260 --> 13:15.454
and legally obtained.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.549
I'm warning you
now, Kalinda.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.558
If any of those jurors
call harassment on you,

13:21.600 --> 13:24.091
I will personally
toss you in jail.

13:24.130 --> 13:27.361
I feel warned.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.391
Thank you.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.384
Last round
of voting--

13:44.420 --> 13:48.186
all 12 guiltys, and my guess--
this would be dinner.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.996
Here's a not guilty.

13:53.030 --> 13:55.021
And another.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.297
Second-to-last round--
looks like we had

13:59.330 --> 14:02.197
two holdouts.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.003
Ugh, Chinese.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.200
Oh, looks like
we hit lunch.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.229
Yeah.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.916
Not guilty, not guilty,

14:13.950 --> 14:16.214
not guilty.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.539
Nine not guiltys
in that round.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.251
We went from nine not guiltys
to ten guiltys

14:20.290 --> 14:21.484
in one round of voting?

14:21.520 --> 14:22.487
Wow.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.953
And that was
just after lunch.

14:23.990 --> 14:26.083
What happened
at lunch?

14:27.260 --> 14:32.197
JUROR: This is a livery horn
button, 18405, perfect backmark.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.595
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.562
Do you collect buttons?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.262
No, but I, I sure can see
the fascination for them.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.402
(phone chirps)

14:39.440 --> 14:41.374
I guess I'm a bit
obsessed. (laughs)

14:41.410 --> 14:43.241
That's what
everybody says.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.202
I have
my own button biog--

14:45.250 --> 14:46.603
Lisa's World of Buttons--
all one word.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.572
Ah, you must, you must blog
on there a lot.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.087
Oh, yeah,

14:50.120 --> 14:52.418
I'd go crazy
if I didn't blog twice a day--

14:52.450 --> 14:54.259
crazier
than I already am now.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.258
(both laugh)

14:56.290 --> 14:59.384
Do, do you mind if I just record
this just for my own notes?

14:59.430 --> 15:03.025
Sure, no problem, but
I don't see how I can help.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.119
Well-- thank
you-- you seemed,

15:06.170 --> 15:08.365
you seemed really upset

15:08.400 --> 15:09.537
by the verdict.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.232
Did you feel the pressure
to vote with everyone else?

15:12.270 --> 15:13.305
Oh, no,

15:13.340 --> 15:16.468
no, I just don't like
to get up in front of people.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.205
I get a little bit
dramatic.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.342
That must have
looked awful.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.347
I cry at the drop

15:20.380 --> 15:21.517
of a hat.
So you,

15:21.550 --> 15:22.710
you don't regret
the verdict?

15:22.750 --> 15:25.287
Oh, no, no,
I didn't trust that lady.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.287
She killed her husband

15:26.320 --> 15:27.617
for the insurance money.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.059
I can't think
of anything worse.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.489
You must have made
a, must have made

15:30.530 --> 15:32.521
a very convincing case
to the other jurors

15:32.560 --> 15:35.324
to get them to
change their vote.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.225
I understand...

15:37.270 --> 15:39.226
That is beautiful,
isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.364
I understand the vote was
leanIng toward not gUIlty.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.368
Y-Yeah, for a while.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.105
Am I supposed
to talk about this?

15:48.140 --> 15:50.404
Oh, the other
jurors did.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.341
They said that they changed
their minds just after lunch.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.210
VVhathappened
dunnglunch?

15:55.250 --> 15:58.048
Nothing-- I mean,
we read the testimony.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.409
The foreman thought
we should.

15:59.450 --> 16:00.417
What testimony?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.280
The partner,
the other cop,

16:02.320 --> 16:03.719
the one who said
he was with her.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.489
The alibi witness--
you didn't believe him?

16:05.530 --> 16:08.021
Nah, he was
so full of himself

16:08.060 --> 16:09.459
in that uniform.

16:09.500 --> 16:14.199
Would you like to see a 1780
Georgian Irish militia button?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.593
Mint condition.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.198
Mint.
DIANE:
Sergeant Alden?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.332
He was our best witness.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.359
KALINDA (over phone):
I know.

16:19.410 --> 16:21.298
She didn't believe him.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.149
They reread his testimony
just after lunch,

16:23.180 --> 16:24.602
and that's what turned people
toward guilty.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.742
That makes no sense.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.668
You might also want to get
someone to check her blog:

16:27.720 --> 16:29.312
Lisa's World of Buttons.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.248
She's on there twice a day.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.212
She might have updated
during the trial.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.615
Good. Alicia,
can you get on that?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.013
Yeah, in about a half hour.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.358
Where are you, Alicia?

16:37.390 --> 16:39.483
A prior engagement--
I'll be right in.

16:39.530 --> 16:40.428
Kalinda,
where are you going next?

16:40.460 --> 16:42.451
The foreman--
he seemed open to talking.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.467
Okay, good.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.467
Stay in touch.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.161
Uh, you, too, Alicia.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.658
And, Alicia, uh, let's talk
when you get back.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.533
O-Okay.

16:52.570 --> 16:53.707
(woman laughs)

16:53.740 --> 16:56.038
Well, I do hope
you consider

16:56.080 --> 16:57.547
moving back to
the neighborhood.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.549
I'd love to, but you know
civil servant pay.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.514
Oh, my
goodness, I do.

17:02.550 --> 17:05.587
I used to teach public
school-- social studies.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.212
Sorry about that.
Work.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.751
Usually it's the husbands
ducking out to take calls.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.257
We take turns.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.497
(woman laughs)

17:13.530 --> 17:14.554
Anyway, I hope

17:14.600 --> 17:15.658
you'll make an exception
for our kids

17:15.700 --> 17:17.759
because I think you'll
really love Zach and Grace.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.097
Well, I'm
sure I will.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.769
I very much want to.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.336
Let me see
what I can do.

17:23.370 --> 17:26.259
I forgot how good
you were at that.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.402
At what?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.408
Charming the
teachers.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.408
It's the height--
they respect the height.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.611
(laughs) So are we going to
let Zach drive all this way?

17:33.650 --> 17:36.539
It's only another
20 minutes.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.808
And Grace?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.408
What about Grace?

17:39.450 --> 17:40.656
She made a mistake.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.749
I worry we screwed up
our kids.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.826
You worry that I
screwed up the kids.

17:45.860 --> 17:48.192
That's true.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.137
What did you say?

17:53.170 --> 17:56.230
KALINDA:
I said it just seems odd.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.806
Yeah, we sometimes see
split votes veering

17:57.840 --> 18:00.570
one way or the other, but
to have a complete turnaround

18:00.610 --> 18:02.407
leaning from not guilty
to guilty

18:02.440 --> 18:04.499
in a matter of hours
just seems odd.

18:04.550 --> 18:05.574
I guess I must
be odd then

18:05.610 --> 18:07.339
because I was
voting not gUIlty.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.642
Until you read the testimony
of the alibi witness?

18:08.680 --> 18:11.217
Yes, I mean, it just
didn't seem to hold up.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.718
I think when you have
a policeman there

18:13.760 --> 18:16.615
in uniform in person,
you get persuaded,

18:16.660 --> 18:18.651
but then when you
read it out loud,

18:18.690 --> 18:20.191
you start to
see the holes.

18:20.230 --> 18:23.529
CARY:
Okay, Kalinda, that's it.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.525
Hello, Cary.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.662
I already
warned you once.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.759
You're under arrest.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.767
For what?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.131
Section 5324a.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.398
Harassment of jurors.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.532
Mr. Alvarez, am
I harassing you?

18:32.570 --> 18:33.639
It doesn't matter
what he says.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.831
He's a public employee,
and his supervisor over there

18:36.880 --> 18:39.872
is insisting you're preventing
him from executing his duties.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.911
Are you serious?

18:40.950 --> 18:42.474
I'm very serious.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.613
Please place your hands
behind your back.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.151
You know this won't stand up.
I know

18:48.190 --> 18:49.714
you'll be out of circulation
for a day or two.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.557
(phone rings)

18:51.590 --> 18:52.557
Hey, what's up?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.423
They supposedly have something
for a mistrial.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.552
VVhen?

18:56.600 --> 18:57.624
Right now.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.661
Get in here.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.158
Good, there you
are, ASA Lodge.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.361
The defense claims to have
eVIdence of jury misconduct.

19:06.410 --> 19:07.479
The defense
is desperate,

19:07.510 --> 19:08.499
Your Honor.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.679
At a certain point,
justice has to be done...

19:10.710 --> 19:12.507
It's being done-- this
is how justice works.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.314
What do you have,
Ms. Lockhart?

19:18.350 --> 19:19.783
Improper contact

19:19.820 --> 19:21.708
between a juror
and nonparticipant

19:21.760 --> 19:23.523
_ is considered
jury misconduct,

19:23.560 --> 19:24.527
Your Honor.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.652
Discussing a case

19:25.690 --> 19:27.419
with friends,
relatives

19:27.460 --> 19:29.189
during the trial
or deliberations.

19:29.230 --> 19:30.663
One of our jurors
has done just that.

19:30.700 --> 19:31.667
Which juror?

19:31.700 --> 19:32.667
Juror number five--

19:32.700 --> 19:33.928
Lisa Banner.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.665
She's written on her blog

19:35.700 --> 19:37.531
during deliberations.
Oh, come on.

19:37.570 --> 19:40.437
ALICIA:
"You're probably wondering why
I've been away for a few days.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.677
"I'm on jury duty-- a murder.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.678
I know it's supposed
to be exiting..."

19:45.710 --> 19:47.439
I think she meant "exciting."

19:47.480 --> 19:48.469
Oh, I'm sure she did.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.647
"...but you can't believe
how long this is taking.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.715
"_I sit in this room
staring at these people

19:52.750 --> 19:54.513
who can't make up
their minds."

19:54.560 --> 19:56.755
Yes, I'd imagined you'd have
something to say, Ms. Lodge.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.985
Your Honor,
Ms. Banner has broken

19:59.030 --> 20:00.759
a key rule
of deliberations.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.892
She has discussed
the case

20:01.930 --> 20:03.568
with those
outside of the jury.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.897
Her blog received

20:04.930 --> 20:09.435
45,000 individual hits
on the day in question,

20:09.470 --> 20:12.803
so Ms. Banner shared
her views with 45,000

20:12.840 --> 20:14.376
non-jury members.

20:14.410 --> 20:16.332
God, how I hate
that word "blog."

20:16.380 --> 20:17.642
Ms. Lodge.
Your Honor,

20:17.680 --> 20:19.568
this gives new meaning
to reaching.

20:19.610 --> 20:23.888
That blog entry was generic,
unspecific, and unknowing.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.616
I regrettably agree,

20:26.650 --> 20:28.311
Ms. Lockhart.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.987
Ms. Banner's banal_
observations hardly rise

20:30.020 --> 20:32.580
_ to the level of
improper contact,

20:32.630 --> 20:33.790
though I'd love to jail her
for syntax alone.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.298
Your Honor, we would argue
that you censure the defense.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.628
They are sifting through the
personal lives of the jurors

20:38.670 --> 20:40.695
on a fishing expedition
for a mistrial.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.696
No, Ms. Lodge, this
was an unjust verdict.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.367
You know that
and I know that.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.968
That's not true.
It is true,

20:46.010 --> 20:47.739
but the law was followed,
Ms. Lockhart.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.908
I would love to overturn this,
but you have to give me more.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.271
Your Honor, I would like to get
your comments on the record.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.469
They are on the record.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.475
That's what Judith
is doing over there.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.475
What'd I just
say, Judith?

20:56.520 --> 20:57.714
"They are on the record.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.718
That's what Judith
is doing over there."

20:59.750 --> 21:02.457
Bring me something
more, Ms. Lockhart.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.627
The law is the law.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.862
Yes?

21:18.910 --> 21:21.470
You know our investigation
into Lockhart/Gardner?

21:21.510 --> 21:22.477
I think
I may have stumbled

21:22.510 --> 21:24.307
upon another judge
they bribed.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.274
Come on in.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.386
I was so thrilled
when you called.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.910
I've been wondering how
the old friends are doing.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.858
You're not in touch
With anyone?

21:35.890 --> 21:38.950
No, when I got divorced,
I moved across town.

21:38.990 --> 21:42.096
How are you and Peter doing?

21:42.130 --> 21:44.098
Well.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.859
Good, great.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.630
You're our Bill
and Hillary.

21:48.670 --> 21:51.036
Mm, have you heard
of the Mosous?

21:51.070 --> 21:52.833
The...?
Mosous.

21:52.870 --> 21:54.701
They're these people
in Southwest China

21:54.740 --> 21:58.540
who organize their lives
around a woman's sexual desire.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.547
Oh, no.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.569
Th-They completely
separate

22:00.620 --> 22:01.917
sex from family.

22:01.950 --> 22:04.987
The Mosou women get
to decide which men
they'll sleep with,

22:05.020 --> 22:07.409
how long, how
many. (laughs)

22:07.460 --> 22:10.884
All these Mosou men come
knocking on the door of
their Babahougas at night--

22:10.930 --> 22:13.455
that's their flower rooms--
and the women decide

22:13.500 --> 22:14.853
which ones to let in.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.959
And when they're done,
it's up to the women

22:17.000 --> 22:18.797
whether the men
stay or go.

22:18.830 --> 22:19.762
And that's when
I realized--

22:19.800 --> 22:21.688
that's what I'm
missing from my life.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.538
Control. Mm, you have
to read this book.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.935
It'll open your eyes.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.878
So, how are
you doing?

22:29.910 --> 22:31.070
Good.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.998
OWEN:
So, try one of your
other tennis buddies.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.472
They can't all be like that.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.044
ALICIA:
Yeah, but what if
they are? What if

22:36.080 --> 22:38.981
I have spent a decade of my life
making the wrong friends?

22:39.020 --> 22:40.112
Start making new ones.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.515
Nothing's over till it's over.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.584
Well, thank you.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.588
I have to go yell
at someone now.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.518
Talk to you later.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.665
Hello.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.839
Hi. I'm Grace's mom.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.606
I already talked to Grace.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.437
I don't want her_
to contact you again,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.879
and I don't want you
contacting her.

23:01.910 --> 23:03.775
Do you understand?
I do.

23:03.810 --> 23:05.744
But just so you know,
Mrs. Florrick,

23:05.780 --> 23:07.509
I thought she had
your permission.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.075
She didn't.
And she doesn't.
Okay.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.748
But she really should be
going to church.
That's up to me.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.587
That is not up to you.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.884
I don't want you
contacting her again.

23:16.920 --> 23:20.083
She already told me.
Don't worry.

23:20.130 --> 23:21.825
You talked to Grace?

23:21.860 --> 23:24.124
No, I mean, your assistant
already told me.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.094
My assistant?
The one who came for
Grace at the church.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.859
(laughs) The one who
ripped into me.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.128
What are you talking about?

23:30.170 --> 23:32.968
Your assistant
at work. Kalinda.

23:34.010 --> 23:35.898
KaHnda?

23:35.940 --> 23:37.578
She...

23:37.610 --> 23:38.975
I don't understand.

23:39.010 --> 23:41.444
She came and
got Grace.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.789
And said I should never
talk to her again

23:43.820 --> 23:45.481
or she would hurt me.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.450
She... I...

23:50.490 --> 23:52.481
I don't understand.
How did...

23:52.530 --> 23:53.952
how did she find Grace?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.490
Mom, she told us

23:55.530 --> 23:56.622
not to say anything.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.059
Yes, but now I'm telling you

23:58.100 --> 23:59.795
to say something.
What happened?

23:59.830 --> 24:02.867
She used some software
to trace Grace's cell phone,

24:02.900 --> 24:04.936
but it was dead, so she...

24:04.970 --> 24:07.006
drove to see where Grace was.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.873
And why didn't she want you
to tell me?

24:09.910 --> 24:12.071
I don't think she thought
you wanted to know.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.717
Mom, I have to get to class.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.638
Listen, Zach...

24:17.690 --> 24:19.988
Zach... I'm not angry,

24:20.020 --> 24:22.784
but we don't keep things
from each other, okay?

24:22.820 --> 24:24.720
Okay. Sorry, Mom.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.955
That's okay.
We'll talk later. I love you.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.494
(whispers):
"Be sorry."

24:50.020 --> 24:51.988
DIANE:
Thank you, Alicia,

24:52.020 --> 24:53.658
for dropping by.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.908
We just don't talk as
much as we used to.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.224
Well, it's, uh, been very busy.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.899
And you've... been distracted.

25:00.930 --> 25:03.251
Well, I was just dealing
with some home issues,

25:03.300 --> 25:04.995
butthats
all taken care of now.

25:06.030 --> 25:07.668
Good.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.933
You're valuable
to us, AliCia.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.031
When I worked with,
uh, Stern years ago,

25:17.080 --> 25:19.844
we were... very close.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.768
And as a woman,
it was very helpful

25:21.820 --> 25:25.017
to be that
closely assoaated
to a powerful man.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.915
But only to a point.

25:26.950 --> 25:30.215
People tended not to give me
credit for my own successes.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.751
All I'm trying
to say is, um,

25:33.800 --> 25:36.894
women need to help women--

25:36.930 --> 25:38.795
the way you're
helping Caitlin;

25:38.830 --> 25:42.038
the way I am here
to help you.

25:42.070 --> 25:45.107
I want you to get serious
about the partner track.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.903
Really?
Yes.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.703
I've been watching you.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.241
You have it in you.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.942
But you can't
get distracted.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.175
Not with family,
not with...

25:56.220 --> 25:57.346
friendships here.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.883
You have to keep your
eye on the ball.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.855
I can't change that
I have a family.
No one wants you to.

26:02.890 --> 26:05.051
But rising to a certain
level, as you have,

26:05.090 --> 26:08.321
Alicia, there are only two
paths open to you now:

26:08.360 --> 26:11.022
rising further
or falling to earth.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.026
And that's why I
want to help you,

26:13.070 --> 26:14.298
to offer you
my friendship...

26:14.340 --> 26:16.729
and my advice.

26:16.770 --> 26:19.000
Okay.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.031
We've got something
from the jury room.
Oh, good.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.071
More from the trash.
Nah, a threat.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.142
Look.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.944
"Change your vote
or you'll be sorry"?

26:27.980 --> 26:29.117
But the problem is,

26:29.150 --> 26:30.310
we can't use this.
Yeah,

26:30.350 --> 26:32.045
we're not supposed
to even have this trash.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.955
_Can we _tell who
it was written by?

26:33.990 --> 26:36.982
Or to? I mean, if-if
we could question

26:37.020 --> 26:38.954
these jurors, we could
get it independently.

26:38.990 --> 26:39.888
We could compare
the handwriting.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.023
Good. Where is Kalinda?
She was arrested.

26:42.060 --> 26:42.958
VVhen?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.025
An hour ago. A friend
at the courthouse

26:45.070 --> 26:47.630
just called me-- she's
being held on a juror
harassment charge.

26:47.670 --> 26:49.399
Okay, well, let's
bail her out.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.806
I'll do it.
Are you sure?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.979
Yes. I'll go.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.830
Thank you for seeing me.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.336
You're welcome,
Ms. Scott-Carr.

26:57.380 --> 27:00.076
Not sure what I can do for you.
Well, Your Honor,

27:00.110 --> 27:03.045
I've been assigned
a case involving
judicial corruption.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.014
Really?
Yes.

27:05.050 --> 27:08.986
And I was wondering,
as a part of my
investigation,

27:09.020 --> 27:13.081
has any lawyer approached
you about a bribe?

27:14.830 --> 27:16.821
No, no lawyer has.

27:16.860 --> 27:20.023
Good. That's...
that's good to know.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.435
(laughs)

27:21.470 --> 27:25.065
Now, you know that bribes
are not always...

27:25.110 --> 27:26.759
in the form of cash.

27:26.810 --> 27:29.176
They can often be
in the form of gifts

27:29.210 --> 27:31.804
or even the
forgiving of debts.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.239
Harvard Law Review.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.043
This is...

27:36.080 --> 27:37.809
myaﬁmm

27:37.850 --> 27:39.112
on judicial misconduct.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.788
Worth a read sometime.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.185
Please don't confuse
my meaning,

27:42.220 --> 27:43.312
Your Honor.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.057
Due diligence requires
some uncomfortable questions.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.297
Yes. And so does
undue influence.

27:49.330 --> 27:52.458
Are you suggesting that
I'm influencing you?

27:52.500 --> 27:55.094
No, I'm suggesting you're
attempting to influence me.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.335
You were close
with Will Gardner.

27:57.370 --> 27:58.906
You used to play in his

27:58.940 --> 28:00.362
Wednesday night
basketball games.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.173
We've pinpointed
these games

28:02.210 --> 28:05.077
as a prime nexus for
illegal gambling and bribery.

28:05.110 --> 28:07.943
And I am friendly to his
partner, Diane Lockhart,

28:07.980 --> 28:10.983
in her current case-- isn't
that what you're suggesting?

28:11.020 --> 28:13.113
Yes.
And you...

28:13.150 --> 28:16.381
are attempting to use your
position as a special prosecutor

28:16.420 --> 28:19.355
to pressure me to decide
for the prosecution

28:19.390 --> 28:21.153
in this ongoing case.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.124
Well... that's _
where you're wrong, Sir.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.297
There is no ongoing case.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.298
The verdict is in.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.247
How you doing?

28:39.810 --> 28:41.414
'Cause you're looking
a little pale.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.483
Yep, hands
behind your back.

28:52.990 --> 28:55.094
ALICIA:
Kalinda Sharma.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.122
She was brought in
a few hours ago.
Yes.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.068
Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am,

28:59.100 --> 29:01.159
but Kalinda Sharma
has been transferred.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.895
Where?
She took ill,

29:02.940 --> 29:05.534
and she was transferred
to a local hospital
for treatment.

29:05.570 --> 29:07.208
Come on.
This is a game.

29:07.240 --> 29:08.400
That's all
I know, ma'am.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.271
Take it or leave it.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.354
Let me put this
to you simply, Cary.

29:22.390 --> 29:25.029
Unless you want a lawsuit
the likes you've never seen,

29:25.060 --> 29:27.028
I would stop this shell game
with Kalinda.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.925
Because I have
three pro bono clients

29:28.960 --> 29:31.269
who have suffered the_ same
transferring of relatives

29:31.300 --> 29:33.291
and loved ones,
and if I can prove

29:33.330 --> 29:35.798
a systematic effort
to elude arraignment

29:35.840 --> 29:38.001
and bail hearings, well, then
we're talking about damages

29:38.040 --> 29:40.258
in the millions--
and more importantly,

29:40.310 --> 29:43.108
I'll be naming you personally
in that lawsuit.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.199
Hi, Alicia.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.047
I am not joking, Cary.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.072
You bring Kalinda to me now.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.511
(buzzing, door opens)

30:16.310 --> 30:18.346
(sirens wailing in distance)

30:31.960 --> 30:33.484
(starts engine)

30:35.400 --> 30:36.424
Thanks.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.261
(turns engine off)

30:43.540 --> 30:45.531
You found Grace?

30:47.640 --> 30:50.302
You found my daughter?

30:50.340 --> 30:52.900
She wasn't lost.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.645
You brought her home.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.978
She would have come home
on her own.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.282
You told my kids

30:58.320 --> 31:01.289
not to tell me. Why?

31:03.460 --> 31:07.021
I don't want mess.
What mess?

31:07.060 --> 31:09.028
Alicia, I haven't changed.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.493
I'm the same person.

31:10.530 --> 31:13.590
I... I knew I could help,
so I helped, that's all.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.269
Thank you.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.607
You don't have to...

31:19.640 --> 31:21.301
No.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.171
You didn't have to.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.269
That's why I'm
thanking you.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.346
You're welcome.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.371
(starts engine)

31:37.420 --> 31:41.390
Here we all are again.
What have you got for
us today, Ms. Lockhart?

31:41.430 --> 31:43.295
Juror number 12,
Your Honor,

31:43.330 --> 31:45.195
Mr. Grant Rudnick.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.369
He has something
he wanted to say.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.038
(congested):
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.209
I'm sorry, I should have
said this before.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.366
This note was given to me

31:52.410 --> 31:53.434
in the jury room.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.028
CARY:
Oh, come on,

31:55.080 --> 31:56.138
Your Honor,
this is ridiculous.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.399
COYNE:
5324a, Your Honor:
jury tampering, or bullying,

31:59.450 --> 32:01.213
falls well within
the judge's right

32:01.250 --> 32:03.115
to declare a mistrial.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.219
I know,
I interrupted

32:04.250 --> 32:05.945
Mr. Argos. I will
go sit down now.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.184
The jury's decided,
Your Honor, and the defense

32:07.220 --> 32:09.518
shouldn't be allowed
to keep throwing crap
against the wall.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.087
Thank you, Mr. Argos,
but I think it's my job
to figure out what is crap.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.588
Mr. Rudnick, did this threat
change your view of the case?

32:16.630 --> 32:18.359
Your Honor, that's
not the point.
The mere fact...

32:18.400 --> 32:20.459
Ms. Lockhart, I didn't
ask you a question.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.504
Mr. Rudnick... did this note
change your mind about the case?

32:25.540 --> 32:27.007
No.
So...

32:27.040 --> 32:29.372
when I polled the jury in court
and you said

32:29.410 --> 32:31.571
"Guilty in the first degree,"
were you telling the truth?

32:33.250 --> 32:35.275
I guess so, sure.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.619
Ms. Lockhart, Mr. Coyne,
again... nice effort,

32:38.650 --> 32:41.756
but I deny your request
for a mistrial, and I ask

32:41.790 --> 32:44.384
that you be more circumspect in
the future with your approaches

32:44.430 --> 32:46.057
to jury members.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.227
(quietly):
Damn it!

32:47.260 --> 32:48.522
What happened?

32:48.560 --> 32:50.528
He's afraid to go
out on a limb.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.221
Who threatened you,
Mr. Rudnick?

32:52.270 --> 32:53.521
Who wrote that?
The foreman.

32:53.570 --> 32:54.730
Um, I forget his name.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.738
But it's not like
I took him seriously.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.465
I was just one
of the holdouts.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.479
And I think he just wanted
to finish up that night.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.501
What I don't understand is,
the foreman was one

33:03.540 --> 33:06.100
of the "not guilty" votes,
and then, after lunch,

33:06.150 --> 33:07.572
not only
does he change his vote,

33:07.610 --> 33:08.770
but he pressures another juror

33:08.820 --> 33:10.447
to overturn his vote?

33:10.480 --> 33:12.482
Uh, Kalinda, what are you doing?

33:12.520 --> 33:15.318
Anything you want.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.248
I'm on my way.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.723
LISA:
Three Deccan buttons,

33:18.760 --> 33:20.227
all with irises.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.524
Oh, I like the middle one
especially.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.629
Thank you. I do, too.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.628
So, uh, did you talk much

33:25.670 --> 33:27.365
about the case during lunch?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.698
No. We honored the
judge's instructions.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.368
And was Mario with you?
He's the foreman.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.470
Most days he was
during the trial.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.670
But deliberations-- no.

33:36.710 --> 33:39.042
He said he had to do
something next door.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.308
Next door to what?

33:40.350 --> 33:42.409
Chopsticks Shack.
We'd go there every day.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.441
Do you remember
what was next door?

33:44.490 --> 33:46.446
He used a computer
in an Internet caf over lunch.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.481
He had to pay
with a credit card, so,

33:48.520 --> 33:50.579
I was able to find out
which computer he used.

33:50.620 --> 33:53.157
And this is a cache of
the searches that he did

33:53.190 --> 33:55.329
during the hour.
DIANE:
What was he looking for?

33:55.360 --> 33:57.658
_ Articles on our alibi
Witness, Sergeant Alden.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.168
What was it, a grudge?
No.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.067
Alden shot
an Hispanic youth in 2002.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.328
COYNE:
Uh-oh.

34:04.370 --> 34:05.632
Yup. He was cleared of charges,

34:05.670 --> 34:07.535
but there was a lot
of controversy

34:07.570 --> 34:08.798
because the youth was unarmed.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.070
Many members of
the Latino community accused him

34:11.110 --> 34:12.304
of lying during the inquest.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.671
And Sergeant Alden is black.
Not a lot of love lost there.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.846
So you think he changed his vote

34:15.880 --> 34:17.677
when he realized
it was the same officer?
KALINDA: Yeah.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.517
But I don't think
he made the connection

34:19.550 --> 34:21.188
until he was in the middle
of deliberations.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.414
He checked, and then,
he persuaded

34:22.460 --> 34:23.609
the other jurors.

34:23.660 --> 34:26.288
We need to take
this to the judge.
No.

34:26.330 --> 34:27.854
We need more.
ALICIA:
Why?

34:27.890 --> 34:29.699
This is exactly what
Judge Dunaway was talking about.

34:29.730 --> 34:30.651
COYNE:
No, no, no.

34:30.700 --> 34:33.260
Something has changed there.
We need more.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.437
DIANE:
We could get affidavits

34:34.470 --> 34:35.391
from the other jurors.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.589
If they'll swear

34:36.640 --> 34:38.164
that the foreman brought in
outside evidence

34:38.210 --> 34:39.404
to the jury room,
that might work.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.271
Okay, I'm on it.

34:41.310 --> 34:42.572
I'll help.

34:42.610 --> 34:44.749
(phone buzzing)

34:44.780 --> 34:46.407
(beep)

34:46.450 --> 34:47.644
Hello. Alicia Florrick.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.170
VENEGAS:
Mrs. Florrick.

34:49.220 --> 34:51.279
I was hoping
to get your voice mail.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.844
I just wanted to apologize.

34:52.890 --> 34:54.312
It doesn't look like

34:54.360 --> 34:56.487
it will work out
for your kids after all.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.158
Really? Why?

34:58.190 --> 35:00.624
Well, first of all,
I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.266
I'm just trying not
to set an unfortunate precedent.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.291
I hope you understand.

35:07.630 --> 35:10.838
Mrs. Florrick? Hello?

35:10.870 --> 35:13.134
Peter Florrick.

35:13.170 --> 35:15.172
Hey.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.431
Alicia.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.448
What's the matter?

35:19.480 --> 35:21.448
What?

35:21.480 --> 35:23.448
All right, don't worry.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.243
I'll handle it.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.588
(gasps) _
You're back again?

35:27.620 --> 35:29.383
Didn't get enough of my buttons.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.318
(Lisa laughs)
Yeah.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.828
Uh, this is my colleague,
Alicia Florrick.

35:32.860 --> 35:34.589
You might recognize
her from the trial?

35:34.630 --> 35:36.621
Yes. Hi.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.759
I always liked
what you were wearing.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.461
Oh. Uh, Miss Banner, hi.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.537
We were trying to get in touch
with some of the other jurors.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.709
We've talked to three or four,
and we were just wondering

35:46.740 --> 35:49.277
if you had the names
or numbers of the others.

35:49.310 --> 35:50.902
I do. I friended them all

35:53.680 --> 35:56.217
I'm having a display
of my buttons

35:56.250 --> 35:57.547
at the Indiana State Fair,

35:57.580 --> 35:59.787
and I wanted to keep them all
in touch.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.356
Here. Here you go.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.654
Not all wanted
to befriended, but

36:03.690 --> 36:04.850
that's half of
them anyway.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.528
KALIN DA:
Thanks. This
is so helpful.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.494
LISA:
Yeah.
Oh, Miss Banner?

36:08.530 --> 36:09.554
Lisa.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.228
Lisa, is that Peter Dunaway?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.431
Judge Dunaway?
Yes, I sent him
a friend request, too.

36:14.470 --> 36:15.767
He seemed like
such a nice man.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.665
ALICIA:
And he friended you back?

36:17.700 --> 36:19.839
Yes. Why?

36:19.870 --> 36:21.804
During the trial?
Yes.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.239
What's wrong?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.542
I think we have our mistrial.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.318
I never used to bite my nails.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.318
Now look at them.
They're bleeding.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.679
We have some hope.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.359
Thank you.

36:39.390 --> 36:41.358
Thanks for coming by.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.526
No.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.528
I'm sorry.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.526
When you asked me

36:46.570 --> 36:47.889
for my advice before

36:47.930 --> 36:50.467
about whether you should
take the deal or not,

36:50.500 --> 36:52.309
I'm afraid... I was
abrupt with you.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.534
It was the truth.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.231
No. I mean, it was,

36:55.280 --> 36:58.306
but... sometimes,
the truth can be more...

36:58.350 --> 37:00.409
adorned.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.587
I don't have a lot of
friends coming by to see me.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.986
I thought I would.
I have a lot of friends.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.751
This really gets you
thinking about how

37:14.800 --> 37:17.826
people say nice things
and smile,

37:17.860 --> 37:21.796
and then never
came to Vi5it.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.628
I think I can do
with things less... adorned.

37:26.670 --> 37:28.638
I hope this works out.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.978
(laughs)

37:31.010 --> 37:33.808
I do, too.

37:33.850 --> 37:36.512
(sighs)

37:38.350 --> 37:41.012
Oh. Mr. Florrick.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.551
Hello. How are you?

37:42.590 --> 37:44.649
Good, ma'am.
Very good.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.453
I-I wish you'd made
an appointment.

37:46.490 --> 37:47.718
I just spoke to your wife.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.648
Unfortunately, we don't have

37:49.700 --> 37:51.668
any room for your two children,

37:51.700 --> 37:53.998
but I was saying,
beginning next year,

37:54.030 --> 37:55.361
uh...
(door closes)

37:55.400 --> 37:56.697
(clears throat)

37:56.740 --> 38:00.528
At the start of next year,
we should have room.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.508
You know what one
of the advantages

38:05.550 --> 38:07.677
of my position is,
Ms. Venegas?

38:07.710 --> 38:10.042
No. I...

38:10.080 --> 38:11.889
I imagine
there must be many.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.979
No, not really.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.885
But background checks--

38:15.920 --> 38:19.048
thorough background checks--
are one of the great advantages.

38:19.090 --> 38:21.650
As I was

38:21.700 --> 38:24.021
perusing through some
of these background checks,

38:24.060 --> 38:26.722
I was somewhat surprised to find

38:26.770 --> 38:30.331
that many of your teachers
had... issues.

38:30.370 --> 38:33.009
Of course, I was only checking
as a concerned parent

38:33.040 --> 38:35.736
who was thinking of
sending his children here.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.772
Luckily,
there were no sexual charges.

38:38.810 --> 38:41.643
But there were quite a few
felony DUIs,

38:41.680 --> 38:44.683
check kiting and...
drug charges.

38:46.890 --> 38:49.108
You are the State's Attorney,
sir.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.651
Yes, ma'am, I am.

38:51.690 --> 38:54.056
That's why I'm going
to say this to you...

38:54.090 --> 38:56.422
very slowly.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.767
I'm the State's Attorney.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.030
You don't say no to me.

39:02.070 --> 39:05.733
And you especially
don't say no to me

39:05.770 --> 39:07.829
when it concerns my children.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.871
Do you understand?

39:11.910 --> 39:13.741
I think the word

39:13.780 --> 39:16.044
you're looking for is "yes."

39:18.420 --> 39:20.388
Good.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.479
So...

39:22.520 --> 39:25.887
we'll be hearing from you.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.057
Are we thinking the third time
is the charm, Ms. Lockhart?

39:28.090 --> 39:30.456
That is our hope, Your Honor.
Well, I should
warn you.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.819
My patience is running thin.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.963
The Illinois Code
of Judicial Conduct.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.695
'Uudges

39:35.740 --> 39:37.890
"should refrain from
all individual contact

39:37.940 --> 39:39.931
"with a juror
outside the presence

39:39.970 --> 39:41.574
of court during a trial
and deliberations."

39:41.610 --> 39:42.679
Yes.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.474
Have you detected some contact
I made with jurors?

39:45.510 --> 39:46.772
You friended one.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.710
Juror number five, Lisa Banner,

39:48.750 --> 39:51.878
the blogger
of Lisa's World of Buttons.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.888
I didn't friend her.
ALICIA:
You did, Your Honor.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.808
She sent you a friend
request three days ago,

39:55.860 --> 39:57.555
and you responded
in the affirmative.

39:57.590 --> 39:58.887
Because I'm running
for re-election.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.023
Somebody friends me,
I assume it's a supporter.

40:01.060 --> 40:01.856
Your Honor, this is...

40:01.900 --> 40:03.527
I know this is.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.063
DIANE:
Your Honor, this is
serious grounds for a mistrial.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.761
Unknowingly or not,

40:07.800 --> 40:09.836
you made contact with a juror

40:09.870 --> 40:11.064
during the trial.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.898
This is a serious
ethical breach.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.932
I used to find this job
eternally enlightening,

40:17.980 --> 40:19.971
even enjoyable.

40:20.010 --> 40:23.639
Not anymore,
not a single day.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.443
Your Honor...
No.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.946
I declare a mistrial.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.458
Let's take it
back into court,

40:30.490 --> 40:33.084
make it official.

40:33.130 --> 40:34.757
(whispers):
Good job.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.222
That's what
I was talking about.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.228
That'll get
you partnership.

40:38.260 --> 40:40.194
(door closes)

40:52.250 --> 40:54.810
So you chased them all away,
huh?

40:54.850 --> 40:56.215
(laughs)

40:56.250 --> 40:59.583
I don't believe I did anything
of the kind, Mr. Gardner.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.589
They found the better part
of valor.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.019
Here's your problem.

41:07.060 --> 41:09.255
You don't have
any evidence, lady.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.052
You have accusations.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.965
And you're trying
to sweat me.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.059
Well, I don't sweat easily.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.988
Then let's talk.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.803
That's all I want to do.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.102
Just talk.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.698
I'm not after you.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.970
I don't think
you know who you're after.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.205
Oh, I know who I'm after.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.899
Somebody who used
to be involved

41:27.950 --> 41:29.918
in your basketball
games years ago.

41:29.950 --> 41:31.986
Who are you talking about?

41:32.020 --> 41:33.908
Peter Florrick.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.109
That's right.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.754
It all comes full circle,
doesn't it?

41:42.660 --> 41:44.764
Wow.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.791
Only in Cook County.

41:48.870 --> 41:53.000
Peter puts you in charge
of an investigation into me,

41:53.040 --> 41:55.838
and you turn it back on him.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.844
I...

41:59.880 --> 42:01.848
(laughs)

42:01.880 --> 42:03.541
I'm speechless.

42:03.580 --> 42:04.888
Peter's clean this term,

42:04.920 --> 42:08.014
but he wasn't his
first term, was he?

42:08.050 --> 42:10.848
And you know where
his weaknesses lie.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.928
Well, I know a lot of things.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.599
Then let's talk.

42:16.630 --> 42:17.995
No.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.622
Yes.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.968
It's the smart move.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.036
No.

42:24.070 --> 42:26.334
I'm hiring myself a lawyer...

42:26.370 --> 42:28.930
and then we can talk.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.335
The next we talk, it'll be
in front of a grand jury.

42:31.380 --> 42:35.009
Okay. So be it.

42:38.120 --> 42:41.044
* Don't leave

42:41.090 --> 42:46.756
* 'Cause I believe

42:46.790 --> 42:52.695
* We were meant to sleep

42:52.730 --> 42:54.732
* In the dirt.
