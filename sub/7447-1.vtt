00:50.200 --> 00:54.125
Once upon a time,
there lived a beautiful queen called Kate.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.044
Queen Kate.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.248
Eileen, water's gone cold.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.560
Eileen, move your fat rump!

01:03.720 --> 01:07.088
She was loved and admired
by all her subjects.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.484
You look like you've put on
a few pounds.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.005
Not up the duff, are ya?

01:19.160 --> 01:20.764
Piss off, Ma.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.251
Scrub me back?

01:22.400 --> 01:24.801
Do it yourself.
Oh, go on, be a sport.

01:26.160 --> 01:31.291
As far as Queen Kate was concerned,
the world was very nearly perfect.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.808
There was only one small blot
on the landscape,

01:34.960 --> 01:39.443
and that blot was
young and blonde and pretty.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.446
She too was a queen,
and her name was Tilly.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.364
Mirror, mirror, on the wall...

01:45.520 --> 01:46.726
Queen Tilly.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.167
Who's the most gorgeous tart and all?

01:50.200 --> 01:52.806
Matilda Mary Devine...

01:52.960 --> 01:55.247
.. it's just gotta be you. â

01:55.400 --> 02:00.691
It was the 1920s, the district
of Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.242
And the underworld was ruled
by two rival crime queens.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.164
Tilly Devine...

02:06.320 --> 02:10.484
...a new chum from England
with a talent for acquiring brothels.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.961
And Kate Leigh...

02:14.200 --> 02:17.409
...who had a stranglehold
on the city's bootleg grog business.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.289
Katie?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.010
It's five o'clock.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.769
60 minutes to Showtime.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.682
Mmm, hi, boys.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.891
Nice to see ya. Mm-hm.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.730
Started out just drinkin" beer

02:48.960 --> 02:51.884
Darlinghurst was the Sin City of its time.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.611
Punters flocked there
to indulge their vices,

02:54.760 --> 02:57.331
and they were rarely disappointed.

03:00.840 --> 03:06.165
About the only thing you couldn't get
in Darlo was a drink after six o'clock.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.448
Legally, that is.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.407
Of course, sly grog was available
on every street corner

03:13.560 --> 03:17.884
if you knew where to look,
if you knew the right door to knock on.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.169
And most of those doors
were owned by Kate Leigh.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.970
After hours, a respectable butchers shop
was liable to turn into a bingo parlour...

03:28.120 --> 03:31.169
'bingo' being the slang for 'booze'.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.201
Tilly Devine launched her career
as a prostitute back in London

03:42.360 --> 03:45.091
at the tender age of 16.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.326
Yeah-ee-yeah
Oh-oh...

03:50.480 --> 03:55.088
That's how she met and married
a handsome Aussie soldier Jim Devine.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.571
What a catch.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.927
By 25, Tilly controlled 18 brothels
in Darlinghurst alone,

04:04.080 --> 04:07.527
all of them cheek-by-jowl
with Kate's sly grog shops.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.206
Evening, boss. You look nice.
Very ooh-la-la.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.648
Come on, sing it! You know the words.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.202
The 1920s weren't known as
the Roaring Twenties for nothing.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.250
It was a party that never stopped.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.804
One for the Scrapbooks.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.004
Worst woman?

04:38.160 --> 04:40.731
Ought to kick that reporter up the bum.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.723
It's a nice likeness.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.848
You look bonny.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.927
Judge says Kate Leigh must be
the worst woman in Sydney.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.809
That sounds about right-
bloody old cow.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.962
Where's me clean shirt?
You're missing the point!

04:59.120 --> 05:01.521
They're talking about her by name.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.409
No mention of Tilly Devine.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.131
Oh, so you wanna be
the worst woman in Sydney, do ya?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.760
Jim, I wanna be recognised
for what I am.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.524
I recognise you, sweetheart.

05:10.680 --> 05:15.049
I'd recognise that arse of yours
a hundred foot down a mine shaft.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.601
Come here.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.043
Even 90 years ago,
the cult of celebrity was irresistible.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.445
The trouble was there could only ever be
one âworst woman in Sydney?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.443
Oh! Morning, Mrs Leigh.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.602
You're looking well, Mrs Devine.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.922
Mm, mustn't grumble.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.287
That's a very handsome dog
you got there, Mrs Leigh.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.010
It's a Pomeranian, I believe.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.323
I found him wandering willy-nilly
around Woolloomooloo. Didn't I, Spot?

05:45.480 --> 05:47.642
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.041
You know the Royal Family
have Pomeranians?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.202
Oh, for afternoon tea, you mean?
On toast?

05:53.360 --> 05:57.922
Imagine the pups this little fella'd give ya.
Be pretty dandy, eh?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.883
Mrs Leigh, I don't suppose
you'd mind terribly if...

06:01.040 --> 06:04.408
I don't mind giving youse a loan of him,
I suppose.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.211
Hmm.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.802
Can't stand the thought of giving him
back to that old battleaxe.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.010
I bet you she don't even stand up when
they sing the national anthem.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.645
Hey.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.882
You're plotting something.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.921
No.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.449
Tilly had no intention of returning
Kate's prized Pomeranian stud dog.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.170
She'd keep him for herself

06:36.320 --> 06:41.087
and, with the help of chemicals, disguise
one of her own infertile inbred pooches

06:41.240 --> 06:43.163
and give that one back instead.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.924
Simple.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.401
Excuse me, Mrs Leigh?

06:47.560 --> 06:50.404
Tilly says, âThanks very much
for the loan of the boozer dog. â

06:50.560 --> 06:53.245
And here's a box of chocolates,
with her compliments.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.970
Are you my little baby?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.645
Yeah? Hey, you!

06:56.800 --> 06:57.881
Stop it.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.566
Spot, walkies!

07:01.560 --> 07:02.800
Come on, boy.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.490
What's the matter?

07:16.240 --> 07:18.129
God, you're older than I am.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.965
Get out here, you thieving Pommy bitch!

07:21.120 --> 07:23.168
Octopus, knock the fuckin' door down.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.891
You know Big Jim keeps
a.303 under his bed?

07:26.040 --> 07:29.123
Oh, yeah? I'll do it myself, cowards.
You're both sacked.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.644
Piss off. I'm trying to have
a fuckin' snooze.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.365
Oi!

07:40.520 --> 07:43.251
Knock it off or I'll call the cops!
You pinched me dog!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.368
I never did no such thing!
I want him back!

07:45.520 --> 07:47.682
You've got bats in the belfry.
You're nothing but a common thief!

07:47.840 --> 07:49.444
Hang on a tick.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.049
Gardyloo!

07:53.200 --> 07:55.043
Oh!

07:56.080 --> 07:57.684
Uh!

07:57.840 --> 08:01.003
You fucking whore.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.324
I was gonna suggest
you kissed and made up.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.960
Now you got yourself an enemy for life.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.850
Big Jim Devine was right.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.401
Kate was way too proud
to ever forgive Tilly

08:19.560 --> 08:22.006
for trying to pull the wool over her eyes.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.165
And that's how Kate and Tilly's
decade-long feud started -

08:26.320 --> 08:29.961
over nothing, over a borrowed dog.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.645
This is the story of that feud.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.600
Hang onto your hats -
it's not gonna be pretty.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.205
Come on! Come on!

08:43.360 --> 08:46.284
We're selling sex,
not pots of bloody jam!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.404
Elsie, open up your gown.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.283
I wanna open another house.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.488
A big joint. Make a splash.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.210
We can't handle what we got now.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.443
Oh, bloody hell, Peg. Don't tell me.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.841
You're not in the family way again,
are you?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.604
I'm sorry, Till.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.330
Why'd you think
they invented f rangers?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.209
Backyard, now.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.442
Everybody else, tummies in, tits out.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.604
I found us a place in Crown Street.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.967
You find the muscle, I'll find the girls.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.122
I dunno,
sounds like hard bloody yakka.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.805
Oh, think of the money, though.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.325
Haven't we got enough
coming in?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.084
What kind of talk's that?

09:22.240 --> 09:27.121
You know, I would love to buy you
a big, shiny new car.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.122
Yeah, right.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.645
You ready, Peg?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.201
OK, come here.
Just relax, girl. It's alright.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.761
It's really just you shoving it
up Kate Leigh, yeah?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.524
Yeah, so what?

09:36.680 --> 09:40.162
I'm gonna rub that hairy clam's
ugly face in the dirt.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.448
Show her who she's fuckin' dealing with.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.724
Go on, one more. For luck.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.645
You know, I could see meself
in a roadster.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.804
Yeah. Nice little Pontiac maybe.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.042
Ugh! om

10:00.760 --> 10:02.205
Alright, boys.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.964
Let's get cracking.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.202
Oh!
And stay out!

10:07.360 --> 10:08.850
Ooh!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.490
Oh!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.608
Get out of here, you bastard!

10:13.760 --> 10:15.569
Oh!

10:15.720 --> 10:17.722
Frank Green?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.325
Who the bloody hell are you?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.290
They call me Big Jim.
Like to offer you a job, son.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.771
Yeah, what doing?
Arrrr!

10:23.920 --> 10:25.524
Uh! Ooh!

10:25.680 --> 10:27.409
Take a wild guess.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.886
Aw! Hello, dear.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.849
My name's Tilly.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.722
And I was wondering, how are you
gonna support yourself and the bubba

10:52.880 --> 10:55.167
when they kick you out of here?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.645
What about it, mister?

11:00.800 --> 11:03.280
Hello, Nugget! How's it going?

11:03.440 --> 11:06.171
Tilly Devine, wherever did you get
that delicious hat?

11:06.320 --> 11:09.290
I got a business proposition for ya,
you and your molls.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.771
What she talking about, Nugget?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.400
Don't you take my name in vain.
Simmer down, Aggie.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.369
Don't I always look after you ladies?

11:21.360 --> 11:25.331
Any of you bitches steal my clients,
I'll bite your nipples off.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.847
Settle down, Aggie.
We're all friends here.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.287
Go on, have some snow on the house.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.090
Celebrate opening night.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.642
Anyone else want
a little bit of magic dust?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.962
Make the night go better.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.804
Enjoy yourselves, girls.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.691
And let's all make a big pile of money.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.723
All present and correct, boys?

11:58.880 --> 12:01.486
You're a veteran, Jim?
4th Tunnelling Company, yeah?

12:01.640 --> 12:03.642
Oh, checking up on me.
Belgium, eh?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.529
Crikey, you must've seen some action.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.604
Oh, he did, inside every cathouse
between here and gay Paris.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.604
Some things a man shouldn't
have to see, Frank - goes against God.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.001
Wish I'd served.
I was too young.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.650
Sniper - that'd be me.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.326
Good with a gun are you?
I would be if I had one.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.811
Lee-Enfield.303- that's what I want.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.008
It's the first choice of soldiers
the world over.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.525
Hard to fit in your pocket, but.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.284
Here we go.

12:29.560 --> 12:34.851
Gentlemen, welcome to Tilly Devine's
Palace of Pleasure for a taste of heaven.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.490
I'd have called it
Big Jim's Palace of Pleasure.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.971
He's wearing the trousers.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.884
Oh, the law won't allow it.
Why not?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.884
See, menfolk is not permitted to live off
the moral earnings of women.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.247
But a Sheila can? Oh, that ain't fair.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.051
Hello. Who's this little moppet?

12:49.200 --> 12:52.283
It ain't no schoolhouse round here, love.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.283
Um, is this a bawdy house?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.011
There ain't nothing for you here, dear.
Best run along home.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.367
I should say it is a bawdy house.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.284
Thank you.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.050
Well...

13:16.360 --> 13:18.442
What kind of job?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.568
As a prostitute.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.451
How old are you, my darling?
19.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.648
And still at school?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.804
Have a woman's body.
Shall I show you?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.691
You ain't done this before,
have you, darling?

13:31.840 --> 13:34.207
Alright, give us a butchers
at your thrupenny bits.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.128
Show us your tits.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.681
Oi, Shoo! And close the door.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.366
Police, police, police!

13:43.520 --> 13:45.443
Police! it's a raid!
Get the snow off the girls.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.967
Flush it down the grease trap.
You go out the back way.

13:48.120 --> 13:48.962
Police!

13:49.120 --> 13:51.691
Oi, what's the big idea?!
We're raiding you. Step aside.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.444
What for?
Running a disorderly house.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.682
Now out of the way, Tilly,
or I'll flatten you too.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.683
Oh, it's a fuckin' outrage!

13:57.840 --> 14:00.127
I wanna see your fuckin' warrant!

14:00.280 --> 14:03.124
Go on, get that shit down the sink!
Come on, hurry up!

14:03.280 --> 14:05.203
Gotta get you the bloody hell
out of here.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.805
What's the emergency?
You're jail-bait.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.769
Time to go home, little girl.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.524
Stop right there. Police.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.842
Special Constable Armfield.
Oh, Jesus. Bloody hell.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.844
If you're flushing down the drain,
cease and desist.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.249
Is this some sort of costume?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.770
What's your name?

14:47.400 --> 14:49.721
What were you doing in a brothel?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.201
You do know what a brothel is?

14:57.840 --> 15:00.525
I can see you're a good girl
from a good home.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.729
Would you like me to telephone
your parents to tell them you're alright?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.689
Won't they be worried about you?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.330
It's none of your business.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.443
My name's Lillian.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.767
Nellie.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.764
Nellie, it worries me
when a girl like you

15:22.920 --> 15:27.323
finds herself consorting with
ne'er-do-wells in a place like that.

15:27.480 --> 15:32.361
I've seen many a young girl stray,
and I hope you're not one of them.

15:33.520 --> 15:38.128
It's all too easy to lose your reputation,
and once it's gone, it is gone forever.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.922
Promise me you'll go home
and forget about tonight's escapade.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.769
If I stay there, I suffocate.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.287
I just wanna live a little bit.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.090
As a prostitute?

15:51.720 --> 15:53.688
Just wanna have some fun.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.324
Can I go now?

16:04.480 --> 16:08.769
Lillian Armfield was
the first female police officer in Australia,

16:08.920 --> 16:10.649
possibly the world.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.962
Her job was looking after fallen women.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.682
Nellie Cameron, the middle-class
schoolgirl with the perfect vowels,

16:17.840 --> 16:19.729
would be her greatest challenge.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.008
Why tonight, eh?

16:22.160 --> 16:24.401
Opening night-
how bloody mean can you be?

16:24.560 --> 16:27.131
We had reliable information,
had to act on it.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.931
Pull the other one.
Yeah, and I bet I know who shelf ed me.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.766
And the hairy fuckin' clam's
gonna pay for it, you mark my words.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.605
Oi, get Bill a scone.
I baked 'em meself.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.603
Uh, the tea'll be fine. Thanks.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.364
Wally, the scones.

16:43.400 --> 16:48.327
Mrs Leigh, I appreciate any information
you can pass my way.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.883
But I will not be used as a weapon
in your war against Tilly Devine.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.849
Oh, I don't know
what you're driving at, Bill.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.923
It's Inspector Mackay.
Oh...

16:57.080 --> 16:59.242
Put them scones away, Wally.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.366
Now you listen to me, Inspector Mackay.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.409
I'm a good citizen.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.243
Just trying to do me duty.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.448
So if I happen
to come across information

17:12.599 --> 17:15.729
pertaining to the criminal activities
of a certain slut in Palmer Street,

17:15.880 --> 17:17.928
I'll expect you to act on it, alright?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.651
Or I'll write a letter of complaint
to the Premier.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.565
Madam, I will not be threatened by you.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.688
Or anybody else.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.808
Now hear this.

17:27.960 --> 17:32.010
I intend to conduct a search
of these premises for illegal firearms.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.046
You'd leave me defenseless
in the face of me enemies, would ya?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.487
Can always pelt them with your scones.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.404
On...

17:54.560 --> 17:57.325
No more remarkable woman
ever strode upon

17:57.480 --> 18:00.484
the stage of Sydney's night-life
than Kate Leigh.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.005
Yeah?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.764
What about it?

18:03.920 --> 18:05.365
That's Sydney for ya.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.284
Pussy town.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.125
You tried your luck up there,
didn't you, Squizz?

18:10.280 --> 18:14.080
Came running home with your tail
between your legs, as I recall.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.767
The jacks had it in for me
the day I got there. You know that.

18:19.560 --> 18:24.009
My point, Norman -
them crooks up there... soft as butter.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.128
That town's ripe for the plucking.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.284
Just as long as
your name's not Squizzy Taylor.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.611
A very disturbing rumorâs
reached my ears, Norm.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.127
A gang of scallywags
are planning to knock over

18:42.280 --> 18:43.805
the bookies at Moonee Valley.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.644
You heard about it?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.404
Lot of crime around, Squizz.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.847
But a major job like that
needs my blessing.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.809
Five years ago, maybe.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.610
I still run this town.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.650
Your name keeps coming up
in connection, as it were.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.282
Man's got a right to make a living,
support his family.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.044
You can't deny me that.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.089
Don't I cut you a piece of what's mine?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.641
You're not doing the business
no more, Squizz!

19:06.800 --> 19:08.131
Not since you come out of stir.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.248
I'm as big as I ever was.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.084
You're like a brother to me, Norm.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.810
I trusted ya.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.406
And now I find out
you're a knocker in the woodpile.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.281
Oh, it's nothing personal, Squizz!
I take betrayal very fuckin' personal!

19:24.880 --> 19:27.247
Ooh! Uh...

19:30.680 --> 19:32.603
Right, you've got two choices, mate.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.162
You get out of Melbourne
while the going's good...

19:37.360 --> 19:39.840
...or I'll end it right here.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.642
'Cause I don't wanna wait around
for the day you decide I'm in your way.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.571
Always wanted to see Sydney.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.811
You show them pussies who's boss, eh?

20:08.960 --> 20:10.530
And do me a favour?

20:10.680 --> 20:13.604
Yeah?
Kick Kate Leigh in the balls for me.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.846
Ooh! Oh...

20:28.160 --> 20:30.447
Ooh!

20:30.600 --> 20:31.761
Ugh! ugh!

20:36.800 --> 20:40.691
This is a Colt self-loading
semiautomatic pistol,.45 caliber.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.729
Stop an elephant,
if you hit in the right spot.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.123
Side-arm of choice
for the United States Army.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.805
Mate, it's bloody beautiful.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.247
Well, make sure you keep it that way.
It's yours.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.006
Mine?
Yeah.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.650
Whacko.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.882
How much?

20:57.040 --> 20:59.486
It's a present, you twerp.
Why?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.881
Me and Tilly been needing a gunman.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.128
Now we got ourselves one.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.491
How do? Frank Green, gunman.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.724
Frank Green. Gunmen.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.847
Down, boy.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.489
Not you again.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.247
So, what do you think?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.323
Do I pass muster?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.687
Through 'ere.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.003
Where'd you get the clobber?

22:16.160 --> 22:18.401
Took my savings out of the bank.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.482
You know what
you're letting yourself in for?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.005
Yes, I think so.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.002
Mm?

22:25.160 --> 22:28.209
Doing it with strange men for money.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.966
How old are ya?
Don't bullshit me this time.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.361
16.
Oh!

22:33.520 --> 22:35.887
Same age as me when I started.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.361
Any diseases downstairs?

22:38.520 --> 22:42.241
Course not, you're a virgin.
That's good, they're in short supply.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.165
Alright, it's 10 bob for the hour -
that's straight sex.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.164
Double it if they wanna tie you up
or do anything funny.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.210
The whole idea is to get the fella
do his business quick as you can.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.330
That way we shove 'im out the door
quick smart, ready for the next bloke.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.447
Questions?

22:56.600 --> 23:01.128
Um... how many times
can I do it in a night?

23:01.280 --> 23:03.647
As many as I like?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.371
We're gonna get on fine.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.250
Mine.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.689
And this goes into a bank account
in your name for a rainy day.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.683
And here's a little pick-me-up.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.729
Make you feel nice.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.804
Is it Turkish delight?
Yeah, something like that.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.490
Go on, treat yourself.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.568
Morning. Have a good night?

24:29.720 --> 24:32.451
My first shift and I made ă210s.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.682
I'm a bit sore, though.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.171
Hm...

24:36.320 --> 24:38.402
Do you know any rooming houses
around here?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.688
Sure I do. I'll show you, if you like.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.330
Thank you.
Frank.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.562
Nellie.
Frank Green.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.929
Matter of fact, they call me
Frank 'The Gunman' Green.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.411
Really?

24:49.560 --> 24:51.881
Why do they call you
'The Green Gunman'?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.690
Nellie?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.208
I see you didn't take my advice.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.725
That's very sad.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.565
Why don't you go get yourself
a bloody husband, you old bat?

25:25.440 --> 25:29.525
And that's how the
career of Nellie Cameron was launched.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.284
Pretty Nellie -

25:31.440 --> 25:36.082
destined to become the most notorious
prostitute of her generation.

25:37.160 --> 25:41.563
Why did a middle-class gin'
from a good family choose such a life?

25:41.720 --> 25:44.007
What drew her to Darlinghurst?

25:44.160 --> 25:45.889
What was she running from?

25:56.280 --> 25:59.523
Look at all that steam, eh?

26:01.320 --> 26:03.209
This is us.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.886
Watch out, Keith.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.684
Keithy, oh!

26:08.840 --> 26:10.922
He's getting big.
He is.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.527
Passengers are reminded
this service terminates...

26:17.040 --> 26:18.451
Passengers traveling to Sydney...

26:18.600 --> 26:20.284
With you in a tick.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.325
Come to see us off?

26:29.480 --> 26:30.481
I'm touched.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.722
Wanna make sure
you don't change your mind.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.561
A stake... to get you started.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.480
And take this.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.290
You might need it.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.331
And do me a favour.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.448
You come across
a Melbourne bloke up there

26:51.600 --> 26:53.682
by the name of 'Snowy' Cutmore,

26:53.840 --> 26:56.241
put a bullet in his fuckin' head.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.085
He's an evil fuckin' clam.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.126
And, Norm?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.770
Don't come back.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.008
Never.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.285
Are you excited, boys?

27:32.440 --> 27:35.046
Hm? First train ride.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.205
What he want with you?

27:38.360 --> 27:39.691
Who?

27:39.840 --> 27:41.410
Taylor.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.727
Nothing.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.848
Tell me again why we're doing this.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.480
It's a business opportunity.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.488
Get your fresh rabbits!

28:07.640 --> 28:08.971
Rabbitoh!

28:09.120 --> 28:10.884
Get your fresh rabbits!

28:12.280 --> 28:14.931
Rabbitoh! Get your fresh rabbits!

28:17.280 --> 28:20.124
There's bound to be another bloody war.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.604
I don't remember it, the first one.
I was only a child.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.971
Oh, you're lucky.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.249
Next time, they won't stop
till we're all blown to fuckin' bits.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.323
Rabbitoh!
Get your fresh rabbits.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.721
I should really go
and join the other girls.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.291
I'm supposed to start at 2:00.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.283
Who's the boss here?

28:40.000 --> 28:46.007
You know, it don't matter how smart
you are, how brave, how pretty.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.721
In the end, a human life means nothing.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.531
God made you so beautiful, Nellie girl.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.528
Enjoy it while you can.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.161
You're right, get to work.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.847
Leave the old soldier
to get drunk alone, eh?

29:38.600 --> 29:41.968
Christ, my fucking feet
are about to fall off.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.845
Where's young Nellie?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.048
With a client?
She went home sick.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.645
Gut ache.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.928
Oh.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.048
Big Jim offered to drive her home.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.730
Oh...

30:04.720 --> 30:06.802
Get your fresh rabbits!

30:08.960 --> 30:10.769
Rabbitoh!

30:12.240 --> 30:13.969
Lovely fresh rabbits, Tilly.
Fuck off!

30:14.120 --> 30:15.451
Right you are, then.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.206
Fucking off as per instructions.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.922
Missus.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.971
A slice of bread?

31:27.800 --> 31:31.566
I was thinking blue...
for the Pontiac.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.051
Sky blue.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.202
Match your eyes.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.721
No reason we can't splash out
right now.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.884
New place is looking pretty good.
Turnover's healthy.

31:43.880 --> 31:47.009
You just can't keep your dick
in your pants, can you?

31:48.960 --> 31:50.769
Oh, you bitch!

31:50.920 --> 31:53.002
om

31:53.160 --> 31:54.650
Oh!

31:59.680 --> 32:01.364
Oh, fuck.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.242
I got the best apples in Sydney!

32:08.400 --> 32:10.050
They're the best! Get 'em here!

32:10.200 --> 32:12.123
Get your apples here! Penny a pound!

32:12.280 --> 32:15.363
Hey, mister, sink your choppers
into one of these beauties.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.364
Sydney's best apples
right here on your doorstep!

32:18.520 --> 32:20.045
Best apples in Sydney!

32:26.160 --> 32:29.528
Get your apples here!
Pound a penny, penny a pound!

32:30.560 --> 32:34.167
I've got the best apples in Sydney!
Get your apples here! Penny a pound!

32:34.320 --> 32:35.890
See ya, love.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.530
The best apples right here
on your doorstep! Come get 'em!

32:41.680 --> 32:44.251
You boys be good for your mother.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.967
Your style, so debonair

33:02.720 --> 33:04.051
Pot of beer.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.168
No such thing.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.924
I said, âA pot of beer. â

33:09.080 --> 33:11.321
He's right, mate.
There's no such thing.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.891
I'll give you a schooner.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.486
Or a middy, if you're a woman.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.482
You a woman, mate?

33:19.480 --> 33:21.244
Pot goes under the bed, mate.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.243
Full of shit, generally speaking.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.006
Maybe that is what he wants.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.641
Ooh!

33:31.800 --> 33:33.245
Oh!

33:34.360 --> 33:36.488
Tell him, Tom! Take him! He's high!

33:36.640 --> 33:38.608
Police! Get off him, you two!

33:38.760 --> 33:40.808
Butt out, Wickham!
I'll have the three of you nicked!

33:40.960 --> 33:42.644
Get off him!

33:45.360 --> 33:48.091
Sergeant Wickham,
Darlinghurst Police.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.571
Step outside.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.767
Fuck off.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.610
What's your name?

33:58.200 --> 33:59.690
What's your bloody name?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.325
Norman Bruhn.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.244
You a stranger in town?

34:04.400 --> 34:07.483
I only ask because I notice
you're carrying a firearm.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.085
Where you from? Melbourne?

34:09.239 --> 34:13.723
Yeah, that's right, Melbourne, where
we flatten nosy coppers just for fun.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.009
You're not familiar with
the Pistol Amendment Act, Norman?

34:17.159 --> 34:20.801
If you're carrying an unlicensed firearm,
it's automatic prison time.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.770
You hand over the gun or I'll arrest ya.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.208
Where do you want it, flatfoot?

34:28.239 --> 34:30.527
Hm?

34:37.679 --> 34:39.523
Give me my fuckin' beer.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.969
Ahh.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.121
Keep the change.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.524
Get out here!
We're running late!

35:07.680 --> 35:09.887
Peg said you wanted to see me.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.724
I did.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.329
How are you enjoying the work?

35:17.920 --> 35:19.888
Um... I like it.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.122
Hm?
Suits my nature.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.170
Little Miss Popular, aren't ya?

35:26.160 --> 35:29.084
So pretty.

35:29.240 --> 35:32.369
And we're both making money,
that's good.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.520
You ever lead my husband astray again,

35:37.680 --> 35:41.207
I will rip your pretty face right off.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.522
It wasn't...
Shut your fucking pan!

35:43.680 --> 35:46.365
Don't you dare
blacken that man's name!

35:49.160 --> 35:51.128
Remember what I said, alright?

35:51.280 --> 35:53.521
And we might even be friends.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.050
Understand?

36:18.400 --> 36:22.849
Calling Matilda Mary Devine,
James Edward Devine.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.523
Your Worship, the charges
are riotous behaviour,

36:27.680 --> 36:30.524
consorting with women of ill repute,

36:30.680 --> 36:33.411
running a disorderly house
and indecent language.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.403
Hang the buggers.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.483
Be quiet or you'll be ejected.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.529
I'll shut her up, Your Honour.
Shut up, Till.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.728
They're dog thieves, Your Worship.
Throw the book at them.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.530
Fuck off, dobber.
What are you doing?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.170
Are you peeling vegetables
in my courtroom?

36:45.320 --> 36:46.242
Yeah.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.607
They're for me dinner. So?

36:48.760 --> 36:50.330
Bailiff, remove that woman.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.721
Lock her in the brig.
I'm not going anywhere.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.291
Your Worship, can we not proceed...

36:54.440 --> 36:56.249
Silence in court!

36:57.280 --> 37:00.443
You will be charged with contempt
if you don't hold your tongue.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.762
And you will speak only when I say so.

37:02.920 --> 37:06.561
Otherwise, you'll find yourself sleeping
in Long Bay jail tonight.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.210
Repeat the charges, Inspector.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.924
Riotous behaviour,

37:12.080 --> 37:15.846
consorting with women of ill repute,
running a disorderly house

37:16.000 --> 37:17.650
and indecent language in public.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.241
250 fuckin' quid!
I know.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.129
All 'cause of her.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.171
Fuck it!

37:27.320 --> 37:28.162
Tiny!

37:28.320 --> 37:31.085
You know, a real gentleman
would offer to carry this for me.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.288
A real lady wouldn't be
shelling peas in court.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.044
Oi!
Ooh!

37:38.880 --> 37:40.211
Oh!

37:40.360 --> 37:41.964
Ooh! Oh!

37:42.120 --> 37:43.281
Oh!

37:44.960 --> 37:46.041
Ugh!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.201
Oh!

37:47.360 --> 37:49.761
Get her off!
Teach you to fuckin' shelf me!

37:49.920 --> 37:51.968
Oh!

37:52.120 --> 37:54.009
oh!

37:58.840 --> 38:01.446
Get a fire hose?
Where from?

38:10.680 --> 38:13.081
Arr!
Oh!

38:16.680 --> 38:19.206
She's got a gun!

38:20.800 --> 38:22.723
Katie?

38:22.880 --> 38:24.803
Katie?

38:26.440 --> 38:29.011
Where's your smart mouth now, huh?

38:51.280 --> 38:53.851
You fuckin'...
Shut up!

38:54.000 --> 38:55.684
Leave it!

38:55.840 --> 38:57.683
Leave it, Katie!

38:57.840 --> 39:00.525
You're dead, ya hear?!

39:00.680 --> 39:02.728
Come on!

39:04.600 --> 39:06.170
What are you fuckin' looking at?!

39:06.320 --> 39:09.449
Taming pussy town was going to be

39:09.600 --> 39:12.763
a little harder
than Norman Bruhn first thought.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.888
Bloody hurts. Go easy.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.883
Get yourself killed one day.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.567
That's why you're here, Wal.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.088
To protect me, on account of the fact
that I'm a poor defenseless woman.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.685
I'm serious.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.285
Forget Tilly Devine.
How can I?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.283
Who cares if she opens up
a hundred brothels?

39:29.440 --> 39:31.488
No, she wants me dead.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.450
Just wish she'd piss off back
to bloody England where she belongs.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.443
Then all me troubles would be over.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.888
You'd just find yourself
another mortal enemy.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.730
Smoke.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.602
Snowy Cutmore?

40:31.120 --> 40:33.691
Squizzy Taylor says hello...

40:33.840 --> 40:36.320
Whoa, whoa. I'm not here to kill ya.

40:36.480 --> 40:39.529
What do you want?
Well, I heard you were a cruel bastard.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.808
You like hurting people.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.930
You do it for money
and you do it for fun.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.208
Just the kind of man I'm looking for.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.885
Hm...

40:49.040 --> 40:50.565
Who the fuck are you?

40:50.720 --> 40:54.008
I'm the man who's gonna take down
Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine,

40:54.160 --> 40:55.730
and you're gonna help me.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.484
So, what do you say?

40:58.640 --> 41:00.130
You up for it?

41:02.360 --> 41:06.160
I say, Fuck off. I'm busy.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.721
Melbourne!

41:35.880 --> 41:37.450
What do you want?

41:37.600 --> 41:40.080
Putting a crew together,
looking for good men.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.402
Thought you blokes might be interested.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.325
Work for you? Not a chance.

41:45.480 --> 41:48.529
I'm paying top wages.
I don't trust Southerners.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.284
Bunch of gutless wonders.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.564
Ooh!
Ugh!

41:56.000 --> 41:58.002
Oh! Oh...

41:58.160 --> 41:59.650
Ooh!

42:02.080 --> 42:04.242
Let him be, Sid!

42:22.280 --> 42:24.203
What are you doing here?

42:24.360 --> 42:26.761
Looking out for you.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.241
Us Melbourne boys
gotta stick together.

42:30.920 --> 42:33.002
But why?

42:33.160 --> 42:34.764
Changed me mind.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.322
Decided I want me a piece
of Tilly and Kate.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.650
Good man.

42:44.760 --> 42:49.322
Norman Bruhn knew
he'd found himself a powerful ally,

42:49.480 --> 42:53.201
the first step to seizing control
of Sydney's vice.

42:53.360 --> 42:57.809
What he didn't know -
he had only a hundred days to live.
