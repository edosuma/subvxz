WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.002
I guess Melissa and

00:02.002 --> 00:03.670
I guess Melissa
and I are moving.

00:03.670 --> 00:06.306
The Evergreen
Forest, defenseless!

00:06.306 --> 00:10.176
- What?
- Now, I can expand my empire!

00:10.176 --> 00:12.445
This is the
last time Cyril Sneer

00:12.445 --> 00:14.314
tries to take over our forest!

00:14.314 --> 00:17.517
Big profits!! Big bucks!

00:17.517 --> 00:19.753
The end... is near.

00:20.186 --> 00:20.687
ator: This is the Evergreen

00:20.687 --> 00:20.820
ator: This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.292
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.296
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.132
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.900 --> 00:35.668
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.269 --> 00:37.504
Yikes!

00:38.104 --> 00:39.406
Yaaaah...

00:41.975 --> 00:43.510
Yeaaaah!

00:43.510 --> 00:46.613
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.389
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:58.024 --> 00:59.459
Cyril Sneer!

01:02.896 --> 01:05.065
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.367
the Raccoons!!

01:07.367 --> 01:10.070
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:22.248 --> 01:25.885
The Evergreen Forest is
home to many an amusement.

01:25.885 --> 01:29.689
Today, however, it's home
to some unexpected news

01:29.689 --> 01:31.224
for Tommy and Julie.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.128
So much fun!
Come on, Broo!

01:35.128 --> 01:36.396
Jump aboard!

01:42.235 --> 01:44.938
Yes, I'm looking
forward to it too, Sir.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.307
Thanks again. See you next week!

01:51.111 --> 01:52.745
Ugh?

01:52.745 --> 01:54.447
Tommy, Julie!

01:54.447 --> 01:56.116
Yes, dad?
Yeah?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.251
I've got some great news!

02:02.922 --> 02:04.157
Great news?!

02:04.157 --> 02:05.425
What is it, dad?

02:05.425 --> 02:07.594
Well, I've just
gotten off the phone...

02:07.594 --> 02:08.661
Uhm!

02:08.661 --> 02:10.830
...with the head of the
Forestry department

02:10.830 --> 02:13.166
and I've been
offered a promotion.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.436
A promotion?
That's great, dad!

02:16.970 --> 02:19.839
Um.. what
does it mean, dad?

02:19.839 --> 02:22.175
It means I'll be
taking a bigger job

02:22.175 --> 02:23.776
and we'll be moving.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.778
Into a bigger cabin, dad?

02:25.778 --> 02:28.448
No. To the city, kids.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.617
To the city, dad?

02:30.617 --> 02:32.385
Away from the forest?!

02:32.385 --> 02:34.787
Uhm. Next week.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.289
Tommy/Julie: Next week?!

02:40.193 --> 02:41.361
Ugh?!

02:44.531 --> 02:46.933
Earlier that same
morning in the raccoon-dominium,

02:46.933 --> 02:50.036
Melissa Raccoon, expecting
a package in the mail,

02:50.036 --> 02:53.206
received some unexpected
news instead.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.313
Hey, it's the mail!

03:01.214 --> 03:02.382
Oh, wonderful.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.917
It's my prints!

03:04.484 --> 03:07.453
Oh uh, tell him if the
glass slipper is too big,

03:07.453 --> 03:09.489
I can lend him my hockey socks.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.026
No no Bert, not prince!

03:13.026 --> 03:16.229
Prints! The ones your
pictures come out on.

03:16.229 --> 03:18.164
I sent them away for developing

03:18.164 --> 03:19.999
and I can't wait to see them.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.369
Oh, these aren't my prints.

03:23.570 --> 03:27.941
It's a special delivery letter
for Ralph, from the city.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.375
I wonder what it could be?

03:29.375 --> 03:32.745
Hey, maybe Ralphie
won a contest or something?

03:32.745 --> 03:35.415
Come on Melissa,
hold it up to the light!

03:35.415 --> 03:36.950
Let's steam it open!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.785
Honestly, Bert.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.422
Hi, Melissa, hi, Bert.

03:42.422 --> 03:45.091
(laughs) Hi, Ralph!

03:45.091 --> 03:47.560
Oh, did you get
your pictures back?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.662
No, it's
a letter for you.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.764
For me?!

03:51.764 --> 03:54.267
Yeah, special
delivery from the city.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.270
Open it quick.
The suspense is killing me!

03:57.270 --> 04:00.073
...me-uh..lissa!
Oh, Bert!

04:01.774 --> 04:03.843
Well, I'll be...

04:03.843 --> 04:05.578
What is it, Ralph?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.113
It's an offer.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.716
An offer?!
To play for the Yankees?

04:10.617 --> 04:13.920
No, for a job
as editor of a newspaper.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.322
Oh, that's
wonderful, Ralph!

04:16.322 --> 04:18.925
Why, you've talked about
doing that for years.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.861
Well, it's a position
I've always wanted.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.397
But I never thought,
I'd get a chance at it.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.100
It does mean moving to the city.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.836
C-c-c-city???

04:29.836 --> 04:33.439
You wouldn't move to
the city for any old job,

04:33.439 --> 04:34.641
would you, Ralph?

04:34.641 --> 04:38.111
Well, no Burt,
not any old job.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.413
Well, good.
For a second there,

04:40.413 --> 04:43.249
I thought, you were serious
about leaving here.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.451
But for an
editorship of a newspaper,

04:45.451 --> 04:48.288
it's pretty hard to turn down.
What?!

04:48.288 --> 04:51.157
Opportunities like this
don't come along every day.

04:51.157 --> 04:54.627
Melissa, yo-yo-you
wouldn't want to leave here?

04:54.627 --> 04:57.997
Well, Bert, I think it
would be a great opportunity

04:57.997 --> 04:59.499
for Ralph and...

04:59.499 --> 05:01.100
I think we should go.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.404
But what would you
do in this city, Melissa?

05:04.404 --> 05:08.241
Well, I'd continue
with my photography and...

05:08.241 --> 05:10.343
maybe open my
own studio.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.179
Why don't
you join us, Bert?

05:13.179 --> 05:15.682
We'd be happy to
have you come with us.

05:15.682 --> 05:19.986
How can you guys
think of leaving this place?

05:19.986 --> 05:24.524
T-th-the cities crowded
and blech... dirty!

05:24.524 --> 05:27.126
Plus it's full of
people and polluted.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.831
And the Evergreen
Forest is beautiful,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.967
clean.. (sniffs) and natural.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.670
You're right about
all those things, Bert.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.305
I am?!

05:39.305 --> 05:43.176
Well, I'm glad, you've
finally come to your senses!

05:43.176 --> 05:45.211
...and you'd
miss this place a lot.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.980
But the city does
have some advantages.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.649
Uh.. huh.

05:49.649 --> 05:50.817
Like what?

05:51.718 --> 05:53.353
Well.. culture.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.855
Like
theater... and ballet.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.490
Ballet?!

05:58.391 --> 05:59.492
Blech!

05:59.492 --> 06:02.228
And an editorship
of a newspaper.

06:03.396 --> 06:08.000
Well, (sobs) I guess,
that means it's final.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.604
I just don't think I
can pass up this offer, Bert.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.141
I guess, Melissa
and I are moving.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.176
And we'll miss you.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.757
Ah, Gee.

06:30.757 --> 06:35.361
I feel like my whole
world is disappearing.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.730
So do we, Bert.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.432
Yeah.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.433
Sure.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.269
We're off
to pack, old buddy.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.071
I understand.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.375
Take care, little guy,

06:49.375 --> 06:52.044
Watch out for the cars.

07:04.424 --> 07:09.095
I understand that I
have to make them all stay!

07:09.095 --> 07:12.031
Either that or open
a moving van company.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.900
They can't leave.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.203
I need them, and they need me!

07:17.203 --> 07:20.873
Like without me, who would
they remind to clean up,

07:20.873 --> 07:24.610
and who would do all
the things I do for them?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.580
They're making a big mistake!

07:27.580 --> 07:30.416
And I've got to stop them.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.290
For Ranger Dan,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.225
the move to the city was an
important one.

07:39.992 --> 07:43.129
But the promotion really wasn't
what prompted his decision.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.133
Well to tell you the truth
Sis, I'm doing it for the kids.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.269
The city just has so
much more to offer them.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.271
Better education and culture.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.574
The kind of things that
aren't easy to get here.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.843
I think it's important.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.512
Yes, and it'll be nice to
see you more often too.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.981
Goodbye, sis. All my love.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.324
What's wrong, guys?

08:12.358 --> 08:14.927
Well, Tommy and
I were just wondering,

08:14.927 --> 08:17.730
if we'll ever see the
Evergreen Forest again?

08:18.364 --> 08:19.799
Sure you will.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.735
Why, we'll come
back often to visit,

08:22.735 --> 08:24.437
but think about it,

08:24.437 --> 08:27.507
the city will open up a
whole new world for you.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.110
(sadly) Yeah Dad,
it'll be great.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.913
I just hope there's
lots of parks to play in.

08:35.815 --> 08:36.816
Yeah.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.226
It's a shame Bert
doesn't want to come with us.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.562
Yeah, I'm
going to miss him.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.531
And this place!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.766
We'll always be
able to visit on weekends

08:53.766 --> 08:55.468
and holidays, Ralph.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.404
We've had an awful
lot of good memories here,

08:58.404 --> 09:01.340
haven't we?
We
certainly have.

09:02.675 --> 09:05.645
I was just thinking that
I might like to go out

09:05.645 --> 09:07.914
and take a long
walk in the forest

09:07.914 --> 09:10.249
and take a few last pictures.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.485
Why don't you, honey?

09:12.485 --> 09:13.586
I'll keep packing.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.592
They're moving?

09:19.592 --> 09:20.860
Ralph?

09:20.860 --> 09:24.063
Melissa, Schaeffer and Broo??

09:24.063 --> 09:25.865
All of them!

09:25.865 --> 09:28.034
But not if I can
help it, Cedric.

09:28.601 --> 09:33.105
I have a plan and all
I need is your help.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.408
Sure, Bert,
anything you say.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.543
Cedric?
Yes, Pop?

09:37.543 --> 09:38.945
What's going on here?

09:38.945 --> 09:41.914
I just got
some disturbing news.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.015
What's so disturbing,

09:43.015 --> 09:45.084
that it's taking you
away from the vault?

09:45.084 --> 09:48.020
Ralph, Melissa,
Schaeffer and Broo

09:48.020 --> 09:49.989
are leaving the forest.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.736
It's no joke, Pop!

10:03.736 --> 10:05.471
No joke?

10:05.471 --> 10:08.474
Ralph got a
job offer in the city.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.243
No. No

10:11.243 --> 10:13.412
It isn't my birthday either.

10:13.412 --> 10:16.515
And Schaeffer and Broo
are going to the city too.

10:17.583 --> 10:18.718
Cedric?

10:18.718 --> 10:21.621
Cedric, my son,
are you serious?

10:21.621 --> 10:25.324
Yes, perfectly.
You can ask Bert, Pop.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.462
I'm afraid,
it's true, Mr. Sneer.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.964
Those meddling vermin?

10:32.598 --> 10:36.602
God, this is the happiest
day of my life.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.171
I haven't
seen him like this

10:39.171 --> 10:40.940
since he evicted Grandma.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.111
Share it with me,
Cedric, take a lunch hour.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.447

defenseless!

11:11.137 --> 11:14.340
My, my! All mine!

11:14.340 --> 11:17.743
When the window of
opportunity presents itself,

11:17.743 --> 11:19.311
climb through it!!

11:27.153 --> 11:28.988
We shouldn't
be doing this, Tommy.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.825
You know how Dad feels about
things like this in the house?

11:33.659 --> 11:35.194
Yeah, you're right,

11:35.194 --> 11:37.229
but we just couldn't
leave him out there.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.365
Besides, in the city,

11:39.365 --> 11:41.734
there won't be any
forest animals to help.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.170
I guess you're right.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.074
Do you think it's
going to live?

11:49.175 --> 11:50.476
I don't
know.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.445
We'll do what we can to help it.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.622
Are you
going to be okay,
Bert?

12:03.622 --> 12:07.293
Ohh the pain. Ohh!

12:07.293 --> 12:10.262
This came on quite
suddenly, didn't it?

12:10.262 --> 12:12.364
That's
the way it is with...

12:12.364 --> 12:13.966
Ooooh!

12:13.966 --> 12:16.268
...amigos

12:16.268 --> 12:17.870
With what?!

12:17.870 --> 12:19.572
Amigos departus.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.541
It's the Latin name
for what Bert has.

12:22.541 --> 12:26.278
I think,
the end is near.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.214
How do you know, Cedric?

12:28.214 --> 12:30.549
I read it
in this medical book.

12:30.549 --> 12:35.521
It says here that big
changes in life affect people,

12:35.521 --> 12:39.525
and that this disease is
one of the worst ways.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.627
Gee, is there a cure?

12:41.627 --> 12:43.095
Oooh!

12:43.095 --> 12:44.563
Yeah.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.700
There is one cure...

12:47.700 --> 12:48.734
There is?

12:48.734 --> 12:50.870
Ow! Oh, I mean, yes.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.304
There is.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.377
It says here, the only
sure cure for this disease

12:58.377 --> 13:01.280
is to keep everything
in the patient's life,

13:01.280 --> 13:05.217
in this case, Bert...
Uh-oh-aaah!

13:05.217 --> 13:07.153
... exactly the same.

You're
darn right, I'm up!

Well, you
can't leave, not now!

15:18.851 --> 15:21.287
Cyril Sneer has
to be stopped!

15:21.287 --> 15:22.888
We've got to expose him.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.858

Bert, we just can't

15:29.929 --> 15:31.997
Yah, there's
got to be a quick way

15:31.997 --> 15:35.134
to let everyone
know what's going on.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.469
Hmmm.. to do that,

15:37.469 --> 15:41.473
why, you would need a newspaper!
A newspaper!!

15:41.473 --> 15:45.144
Ralph, old buddy, that's
just what I was thinking!

15:46.545 --> 15:48.314
Well, it
would be good practice

15:48.314 --> 15:49.815
before we get to the city.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.483
What
do you say, Ralph?

15:52.318 --> 15:55.554
Well, I guess,
I could publish one issue

15:55.554 --> 15:57.656
to put Cyril in his place.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.892
'Atta boy, Ralph!

15:59.892 --> 16:01.560

standing around for?

16:05.664 --> 16:07.399
We've got work to do!

16:08.567 --> 16:10.836
And so,
faced with the threat

16:10.836 --> 16:12.171
to the Evergreen forest

16:12.171 --> 16:15.808
the gang pulled together for
what might be the last time.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.345
And that was how the
Evergreen Standard was born.

16:41.633 --> 16:44.036
Here's the
latest Bert column,

16:44.036 --> 16:46.805
But Bert, you already
gave me a column.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.874
Yeah, that was
'Dear Bert.'

16:48.874 --> 16:50.843
This one is
'Believe it or Bert.'

16:50.843 --> 16:52.711
Oh...

16:52.711 --> 16:55.948
Oh and uh, don't forget
to leave room for 'Ask Bert.'

16:55.948 --> 16:57.783
Here are
those pictures, Ralph.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.153
Nice work, Melissa.

ready to go to press.

print a retraction.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.466
This is an insult!

20:01.466 --> 20:04.069
It's a smear to the Sneer name!

20:04.069 --> 20:07.039
And worst of all,
it's costing me money.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.042
How can I sell land with
all this bad publicity?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.711
We only printed
the facts, Mr. Sneer,

20:12.711 --> 20:15.180
and we intend to
keep on printing them.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.427
Yes. I've decided
to stay here and carry on,

20:28.427 --> 20:30.896
because what I've
always wanted to do

20:30.896 --> 20:34.399

be done right here

it to heal. Did it, Julie?

needed a little rest

are right here too.

the great things you said

22:05.590 --> 22:07.492
we should have in the city, dad?

newspaper showed Ralph,
