Isn't he just an intern?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.220
How could he…

00:41.220 --> 00:45.120
It took me 25 years to become a Chief from an intern.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.960
There are only two possibilities.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.200
Either we are possessed, or Go Seung Tak is possessed.

Hey, you know what I am thinking?

00:56.370 --> 00:57.500
Do you still remember?

That guy was just like this.

When Professor Cha Yeong Min was an intern...

01:02.710 --> 01:05.209

Are you like this every time you finish an operation?

01:22.490 --> 01:23.860
Like what?

01:23.860 --> 01:25.930
Well… It's the first time I've seen you like this.

It feels strange and unfamiliar.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.330
What do you mean?

01:29.330 --> 01:32.700
You kicked up your heels as if you just won the whole world.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.070
When did I kick up my heels?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.509
It's just because that I haven't felt like this for so long. So very long…

01:39.509 --> 01:42.410
Look at you. You are even more excited.

01:43.620 --> 01:47.190
Yes… I think this is the feeling

01:47.190 --> 01:49.320
that drove me to be a doctor.

When you save someone's life.

02:20.420 --> 02:21.690
Well…

02:24.320 --> 02:26.760
I feel my hands are truly golden hands.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.130
That's how I feel.

02:29.090 --> 02:34.370
After all, a successful operation depends on how skilled your hands are.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.470
A chef's golden hands can make delicious food.

02:39.470 --> 02:42.610
A painter's golden hands can paint beautiful pictures.

02:42.610 --> 02:46.110
A doctor's golden hands can save patients' lives.

02:46.110 --> 02:52.720
Be it golden hands or winning the whole world, it all doesn't matter.

02:53.990 --> 02:58.760
To a doctor, as long as he can save people's lives,

02:58.760 --> 03:02.330
he'll have golden hands and own the whole world.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.000
If you are curious,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.270
you should start trying hard.

03:11.470 --> 03:13.740
If I try hard,

03:13.740 --> 03:17.340
would you let me operate on you in the future?

03:17.340 --> 03:18.610
What?

03:19.910 --> 03:21.210
What are you worried about?

03:22.010 --> 03:24.579
Don't worry. It'll never happen.

03:25.550 --> 03:29.390
Anyway, I won't be a doctor forever.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.790
Gosh, how come I feel so sleepy

03:34.790 --> 03:36.730
and hungry?

03:36.730 --> 03:39.700
That's what you feel after a 12-hour operation.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.100
12 hours?

03:42.800 --> 03:45.870
Hey, if you knew it'd take that long, why didn't you tell me in advance?

03:45.870 --> 03:48.010
So you wouldn't have done it if I had told you?

03:48.010 --> 03:50.110
As least I could have eaten something first.

03:50.110 --> 03:52.610
What kind of operation would take 12 hours?

03:52.610 --> 03:53.980
What kind of job is that?

03:53.980 --> 03:56.010
It's a doctor's job.

03:56.010 --> 03:59.350
By the way, you should do some exercise.

03:59.350 --> 04:00.790
Look how weak you are.

04:00.790 --> 04:03.190
Do some deep squats.

04:03.190 --> 04:07.230
Alas, a two-hour operation can tire me out already.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.660
Twelve hours…

04:10.460 --> 04:13.060
I'm afraid I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.700
It won't happen. Don't worry.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.670
I know Chief Ban very well.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.839
Just wait and see.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.440
It'll work.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.540
Why did you raise your hand when you couldn't even do it?

04:25.540 --> 04:27.410
What would happen if it wasn't for Go Seung Tak?

04:27.410 --> 04:29.510
Were you going to make that kid die?

04:31.020 --> 04:31.980
I'm sorry.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.390

04:41.230 --> 04:42.130
Chief…

04:42.130 --> 04:44.630
Didn't you hear what Go Seung Tak say?

04:45.530 --> 04:50.340
You'll do the rest, Dr. An.

05:11.860 --> 05:14.960
You are the chief surgeon of this operation, aren't you?

05:14.960 --> 05:16.660
I was just assisting you

05:16.660 --> 05:18.130
as an assistant.

05:20.930 --> 05:22.530
Is that right, Chief Ban?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.470
Is that right?

05:25.470 --> 05:27.770
Oh, yes.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.050
You don't lose anything.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.520
The complicated operation was a success,

05:38.520 --> 05:41.050
and your name will be put on the record.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.690
What more do you want?

05:44.960 --> 05:48.430
But only a regular talent can be called talent.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.900
If it's not a ghost… Ghost.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.470
There's no way that it's a ghost.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.010
Fortunately, that ghost is a doctor.

06:02.010 --> 06:04.810
What if he's the Emperor Jade or a Buddha?

06:04.810 --> 06:06.240

16:53.490 --> 16:56.130

16:57.430 --> 17:01.300
You know, even if ghosts don't eat...

17:01.300 --> 17:03.930
Not you, I mean my daughter.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.780
Is Dr. Jang going to America?

17:18.780 --> 17:22.220
I'm not talking about my daughter. It's you.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.890
Even though I'm her dad,

17:24.890 --> 17:26.859
we haven't lived together.

17:26.990 --> 17:29.590
How much can I know about her?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.500
But...

17:31.500 --> 17:34.730
I've seen that look before.

17:34.730 --> 17:37.740
The day she left Korea 12 years ago,

17:37.740 --> 17:41.170
she looked back repeatedly at the airport...

17:41.170 --> 17:46.210
That's the look I got.

17:46.210 --> 17:50.650
Will you leave her behind this time

17:50.650 --> 17:54.120
and go far away?

18:15.610 --> 18:17.170
Wait a second.

18:17.170 --> 18:20.180
There's something here.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.950
It's clean.

18:21.950 --> 18:24.050
Wait, please wait.

18:24.950 --> 18:27.320
The necklace is a little...

18:31.660 --> 18:33.120

18:49.440 --> 18:52.110

19:27.910 --> 19:29.780
President Jang Gwang Deok,

19:29.780 --> 19:32.880
do you want to keep doing this?

19:36.790 --> 19:39.790
No, right? You are tired of it, right?

19:39.790 --> 19:41.430
To be honest, so do I.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.660
I also feel sad

19:43.660 --> 19:45.800
about not letting you go.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.830
I haven't been able to sleep lately.

19:47.830 --> 19:50.230
I can't sleep in peace.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.440
The lack of sleep brought on a bad temper.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.140
A nervous breakdown. You know?

19:54.140 --> 19:57.880
How bad do you want me to be?

19:57.880 --> 20:00.610
Why would you push me to this point?

20:00.610 --> 20:02.080
He deserves a beating.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.120
Too bad I can't throw him out of the window.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.190
Oh, I need a massage.

20:11.190 --> 20:12.920
It's me. Where are you?

20:12.920 --> 20:16.330
I wanted to enjoy go enough before I left the world.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.100
Was I being greedy?

20:19.700 --> 20:24.670
Looks like I'm leaving before you do.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.630
I'm going,

20:52.100 --> 20:53.630
President.

20:54.930 --> 21:01.110
He asked Lawyer Im the day before the surgery

21:01.110 --> 21:04.910
to change his posthumous paper. What a...!

21:04.910 --> 21:07.110
He must have known this was gonna happen.

21:07.110 --> 21:10.650
He was so prescient and cruel.

21:10.650 --> 21:13.650
He doesn't trust you in the end.

21:13.650 --> 21:14.790
You don't know what it says, do you?

21:14.790 --> 21:17.490
If I knew...

21:18.920 --> 21:22.030
Aren't you trying to strengthen the Group and get the hospital in your hands?

21:22.030 --> 21:25.760
That would require me to control the hospital...

21:27.230 --> 21:31.770
Keep it down. This is a hospital.

21:36.610 --> 21:39.480
So, I'm buying you time.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.180
You said you'd take care of the promotion and succession.

21:43.180 --> 21:46.150
President Jang's life is very valuable.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.850
I'll try my best to give you the best discount.

21:48.850 --> 21:52.560
If you keep wasting time like this, you'll pay more interest.

21:53.490 --> 21:55.390
Understand?

21:55.390 --> 21:58.330
I'm willing to do that.

21:58.330 --> 22:05.100
But the guys in the Group will do nothing until they see the President.

22:14.810 --> 22:20.880
Help me locate a phone. The lawyer's name is...

22:20.880 --> 22:28.090
It's my fault. She left because of me.

22:35.770 --> 22:40.070
I tried to do my duty as a father and so I found her.

22:40.070 --> 22:42.940
But it hurt her instead.

22:42.940 --> 22:47.580
I don't want her to get hurt again because of me.

22:48.750 --> 22:55.320
Could you always be there for her?

23:00.260 --> 23:05.560
Didn't I tell you to eat well? Why didn't you listen to me?

23:09.730 --> 23:12.570
I can't take care of you in all aspects...

23:17.780 --> 23:22.410

23:34.490 --> 23:36.560
I've been calling a lot lately.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.400
Calling whom?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.630
So, you're using this to get in touch with the ghost?

23:43.200 --> 23:46.540
I know. I feel something.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.440
Feel what?

23:48.440 --> 23:52.310
You're not Matt Damon.

23:52.310 --> 23:56.110

24:05.260 --> 24:08.430
You know Professor Cha Yeong Min?

24:08.430 --> 24:11.230
Professor Cha performed surgery alone during his internship.

24:11.230 --> 24:15.330
Professor O said he was amazing in the operating room that day.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.900
He said he saw a ghost...

24:18.900 --> 24:19.900
What?

24:19.900 --> 24:22.340
It was also a very difficult operation.

24:22.340 --> 24:25.310
But does it make sense for him to operate as an intern?

24:25.310 --> 24:26.910
It also doesn't make sense for you to do it.

24:26.910 --> 24:29.210
But how can an intern...

24:29.210 --> 24:32.480
So, I thought you'd know something about it.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.490
You two have something in common.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.360
After that, people started to understand that

24:42.360 --> 24:44.900
Professor Cha has excellent skills. So they became quiet.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.630
But the doubts of that day remain.

24:47.630 --> 24:50.800

He was planning this from the beginning.

Hello.

What in the world is it?

36:27.530 --> 36:29.930
What did Seung Jo see

36:31.000 --> 36:33.070
to make him so scared?

36:46.720 --> 36:49.450
This is the highest-standard VIP ward,

That's it.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.590
Gee, what's this?

37:30.590 --> 37:35.430
Oh, it turns out that the lid is broken on the inside.

37:35.430 --> 37:37.170
It took me a long time to find out the real reason.

37:37.170 --> 37:40.570
Things like this have to be scrutinized to find the cause.

37:40.570 --> 37:44.510
It's always not covered tightly. No wonder the smell always comes out.

37:44.510 --> 37:45.710

Whether it's a trash can or a person,

37:47.840 --> 37:49.580

38:16.840 --> 38:18.370
Are you saying Dr. Jang Se Jin?

38:18.370 --> 38:20.810
The attending physician was originally Dr. Bak Ui Hwan from the Neurosurgery Department.

38:20.810 --> 38:23.910
Then Dr. Jang Se Jin voluntarily asked to be the attending physician.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.080
I found it to be strange at the moment.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.690
Then why did you wait till now to tell me?

38:28.690 --> 38:29.850
My apologies.

what operation is it?

41:13.220 --> 41:16.390
Aortic valve replacement.

The valve surgically replaced 10 years ago is reaching the end of its life,

On that cold night, I was afraid that you'd catch a cold,

44:01.120 --> 44:03.250
You cannot just ask me to be careful.

Hey, brother.

44:09.860 --> 44:10.890

45:40.420 --> 45:42.820
Let others see this and they'll think you are two-timing her.

45:42.820 --> 45:43.520
Because it's the second treatment,

45:43.520 --> 45:49.460
it's a very troublesome operation since the opening of the chest.

45:49.460 --> 45:52.090
In a dissection, if the coronary artery is injured,

45:52.090 --> 45:53.700
it'll be a major accident.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.030
I clearly said no.

45:55.030 --> 45:58.070
If the interventricular branch is elongated,

45:58.070 --> 45:59.300
things will be even more serious.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.240
I clearly said, if your tail is long, it will be stepped on easily.

46:01.240 --> 46:06.240
Then the aortic valve must be repaired, and the elongation of the septal branch must be solved.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.910
It is also possible to remove the coronary arteries and re-sew them back together.

46:08.910 --> 46:10.450
It will bleed a lot.

46:10.450 --> 46:14.850
Even if we sew them back together, if anywhere is pressed,

46:14.850 --> 46:16.520
it will be a myocardial infarction.

46:16.520 --> 46:20.190
Didn't you say before that it wasn't such a difficult operation?

46:22.860 --> 46:25.530
Will you do it if it is a difficult operation?

46:25.530 --> 46:27.830
I'll do it either way.

46:54.890 --> 46:56.990
Right, you are irresponsible.

46:56.990 --> 46:59.300

47:27.060 --> 47:30.230
How could Go Seung Tak do such a difficult operation?

47:37.130 --> 47:38.730
That's right.

47:38.730 --> 47:42.200
It's also said he was possessed, but he looks normal.

48:19.170 --> 48:21.040
If I had known, I would never have come to this hospital.

48:21.040 --> 48:24.510
Professor Cha can't do surgery anyway.

48:25.750 --> 48:28.350
Doctors are the same.

48:28.650 --> 48:30.690
Just find me a doctor and do the surgery for me.

Do you know about it?

49:04.520 --> 49:06.420
Of course.

49:06.420 --> 49:09.330
The magic candy I gave her 10 years ago.

49:09.330 --> 49:12.130
How can a piece of candy be magical?
