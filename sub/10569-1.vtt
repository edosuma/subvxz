02:18.250 --> 02:19.999
Back then,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.402
I don't think I knew who I was.

02:22.500 --> 02:26.493
I'm sorry for dragging you out all the way out here.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.349
You're probably thinking it's nothing but mountains.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.150
No, not really.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.152
Onomichi, where you grew up,

02:33.153 --> 02:35.154
was a small but lively port city.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.357
Compared to that, my hometown is a small town in the mountains.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.760
I vaguely remember it. I went to kindergarten here.

02:40.860 --> 02:41.861
You're right.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.064
Shinshuu (Nagano area) is also your home.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.198
It's dad's too.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.503
Don't talk about your dad.

02:46.603 --> 02:50.103
I just want you to be happy here.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.271
You make it sound so easy.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.673
Divorce of his parents,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.276
is very traumatizing for a boy in his puberty.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.678
Why are you tormenting me?

02:59.679 --> 03:02.972
I'm more hurt by it than anyone else!

03:05.485 --> 03:07.320
Was that from Akemi?

03:07.420 --> 03:09.089
Yeah.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.091
Why didn't you reply?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.094
Trying to forget eases the pain of breaking up, right?

03:14.194 --> 03:18.198
I knew you two were in that kind of relationship!

03:18.698 --> 03:21.201
Is that the cell phone strap your dad bought for you?

03:21.401 --> 03:25.038
What, does it hurt your feelings that I'm still keeping it?

03:25.238 --> 03:27.209
As if I get hurt so easily!

03:27.238 --> 03:29.009
- Really?
- Really.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.911
I'm hungry.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.413
You just ate lunch when we transferred in Nagoya.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.015
A boy in puberty

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
gets hungry before he gets traumatized.

03:37.317 --> 03:41.519
I wish a mother of a boy in his growth spurt would at least know that!

03:42.021 --> 03:44.014
Who do you think you're talking to?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.200
<i>Shinshuu, City of Nagano</i>

03:52.500 --> 03:55.993
Good morning.

03:57.500 --> 04:02.500
<i>North Zenkouji Junior High School</i>

04:06.500 --> 04:09.281
<i>Class 3-D</i>

04:09.282 --> 04:11.285
- All rise. <i>Class 3-D</i>

04:12.285 --> 04:14.187
Bow.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.255
Good morning.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.255
Morning.

04:17.255 --> 04:18.760
Sit down.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.262
As Yamamoto's grandfather said,

04:23.362 --> 04:27.164
traditional standing greetings are the best.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.293
I will now introduce you to a new classmate.

04:32.305 --> 04:36.998
He's Saitou Kazuo.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.281
Saitou moved here from Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.283
Do you all know where Onomichi is?

04:44.284 --> 04:47.286
It's a lively city by the Seto Inland Sea.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.690
But you used to live right here in Nagano when you were little, right?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.192
Yes.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.329
Is that you, Kazuo?

04:56.329 --> 04:58.330
Right, you're Kazuo.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.299
You're that Kazuo!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.693
Kazumi...

05:01.800 --> 05:05.400
Remember we were sleeping, and you wet the bed!

05:05.505 --> 05:06.504
Kazuo and Kazumi?

05:06.505 --> 05:08.607
Are you brother and sister with similar names?

05:08.608 --> 05:11.011
No, no way!

05:12.012 --> 05:12.812
Brother and sister!

05:12.911 --> 05:15.215
Quiet down, everyone!

05:15.315 --> 05:19.318
You and Kazumi are childhood friends?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.320
That's great! You already have a friend then.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.323
That's not how it is.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.424
How can that be? I said I'll marry you when we grow up,

05:25.425 --> 05:27.425
and even kissed you!

05:31.364 --> 05:33.134
I said no!

05:34.134 --> 05:36.568
I'm sure he's Kazuo from my kindergarten class.

05:36.569 --> 05:37.437
He has to be.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.240
Same family name, just Kazumi's "mi" changed to "o",

05:40.340 --> 05:42.642
so people always asked if we were brother and sister!

05:42.742 --> 05:45.245
Is that another one of your wild imaginations?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.346
No, no. This is real,

05:47.347 --> 05:48.949
This is the truth.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.851
Then, you two were very close?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.353
You just said you kissed him...

05:52.354 --> 05:54.354
That's like a greeting between kids.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.456
My first real kiss was with you, Hiroshi.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.858
During summer break, after that campfire!

05:58.958 --> 06:01.161
Don't talk about that here...

06:01.361 --> 06:04.397
You haven't kissed me since.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.299
Kazumi!

06:06.399 --> 06:09.602
You kissed Saitou while sleeping with him?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.603
He kissed you and wet his bed...

06:11.604 --> 06:13.473
<i>then</i> what did you two do?

06:13.673 --> 06:14.672
We had a nap.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.375
His underwear was wet,

06:16.376 --> 06:19.378
so my mom made him wear mine!

06:19.379 --> 06:22.381
Then he went back home, and tried to pee in the toilet,

06:22.382 --> 06:24.083
but couldn't get his wee-wee out,

06:24.084 --> 06:26.185
so he panicked, screaming "my wee-wee is gone!"

06:26.186 --> 06:28.187
It's true, his mom told me.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.390
Kazumi...
- And after we took a bath together...

06:30.490 --> 06:32.092
Stop it already.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.593
What's the matter, Hiroshi?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.296
So, the kindergarten is the setting of your fairy tale this time?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.798
You really have a wild imagination!

06:38.998 --> 06:40.799
But Kazuo's wee-wee was really...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.401
Enough already!

06:42.402 --> 06:44.403
- You were listening?
- I was!

06:44.404 --> 06:48.408
I'll never forget the pain of my thing being pulled as you screamed "I want one too!"

06:48.508 --> 06:50.310
I knew it was you.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.211
I knew it was you!

06:52.411 --> 06:55.414
Stop telling everyone about something that happened so long ago...

06:55.415 --> 06:57.416
Oh, he's Hiroshi.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.918
Yamamoto Hiroshi.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.421
He's the class president, and my boyfriend.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.323
I'm Yamamoto Hiroshi.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.325
Nice to meet you.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.328
I'm Saitou Kazuo, nice to meet you.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.929
By the way, Saitou...

07:09.930 --> 07:14.533
<i>this</i> Saitou sometimes slip into the world of her imagination.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.435
In other words, her imagination is quite wild.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.037
So, Saitou Kazuo,

07:18.038 --> 07:20.539
don't let her confuse you about what really happened.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.442
Kazumi, I'll let you borrow this book.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.445
I think you should read more advanced books.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.247
"The Sickness Unto Death...

07:28.248 --> 07:30.049
Kierkegaard"?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.352
One of your grandfather's books?

07:31.353 --> 07:33.752
Yes, it's about the World and God, reality and imagination,

07:33.753 --> 07:37.457
and the inevitability of inauthentic despair.
You will find the meaning to life.

07:37.557 --> 07:41.550
What's with him?
He's the exact definition of the word "pompous"!

07:42.662 --> 07:45.666
Ow, what did you do that for?

07:46.766 --> 07:50.159
But who's "Kierkegaard"?

07:51.871 --> 07:54.474
<i>Then, it happened after school that day.</i>

07:54.774 --> 07:56.475
Hey, Kazuo.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.177
You moved to Onomichi because of your dad's work, right?

07:59.178 --> 08:00.979
Did you move for the same reason this time too?

08:00.980 --> 08:03.383
Who cares? It's all in the past.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.418
But I'm curious.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.720
Is your family still in the udon noodle business?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.489
Not udon, it's soba noodle!

08:09.589 --> 08:11.590
I can't believe you forgot!

08:11.591 --> 08:14.427
You used to love my grandpa's soba.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.828
Really? It wasn't a udon restaurant?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.530
I'm really good at making udon, you know!
( Udon: Thick noodles made of wheat )

08:18.531 --> 08:20.532
Udon is made from nothing but wheat.
( Udon: Thick noodles made of wheat )

08:20.533 --> 08:22.535
That's why it tastes so good!

08:22.635 --> 08:26.206
So? Soba is good for your health.
( Soba: Thin noodles made of buckwheat )

08:26.606 --> 08:28.607
Plenty of vitamin B1 in the noodle,

08:28.608 --> 08:31.610
and the soup contains lots of protein and rutin.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.513
It prevents aging.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.416
Look, it's Kazumi. Completely absorbed by her imagination again!

08:36.515 --> 08:40.019
Masae...
- You two sure seem to get along well.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.424
Yuka...

08:42.620 --> 08:44.024
Wait, Kazuo!

08:44.524 --> 08:48.128
Should I tell Yamamoto Hiroshi?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.330
Hiroshi is a philosophy nerd,

08:51.331 --> 08:53.032
so he's got a big brain,

08:53.033 --> 08:56.136
but nothing down there!

08:56.836 --> 08:58.629
Kazuo, wait!

09:01.841 --> 09:03.243
Kazuo!!

09:03.643 --> 09:06.445
Please, OK? Grandpa?

09:06.547 --> 09:12.040
I just called home to let them know you're coming over to eat soba.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.255
Who let you decide?

09:15.455 --> 09:18.658
What, are you in a position to argue with me?

09:18.758 --> 09:20.160
What?

09:20.460 --> 09:23.463
I haven't told anyone about that secret.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.466
Secret? What secret?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.570
That you killed my grandma.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.672
Huh?

09:32.572 --> 09:36.575
<i>Once upon a time, Kazuo and Kazumi came home from kindergarten,</i>

09:36.576 --> 09:39.580
<i>and saw a fly entering grandma's mouth.</i>

09:42.180 --> 09:48.584
<i>Incredibly, Kazuo suddenly started spraying insecticide into grandma's mouth!</i>

09:50.100 --> 09:53.604
<i>Pshhh, pshhh!</i>

09:57.000 --> 10:02.403
<i>And so, the fly and grandma were both exterminated.</i>

10:02.602 --> 10:05.606
- Mother? <i>The end.</i>

10:06.606 --> 10:09.608
Kazuo, Kazuo!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.778
Don't run.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.614
You can't escape.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.207
My home is this way.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.321
Hey! You forgot our restaurant too?

10:22.421 --> 10:23.725
Huh?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.418
This is my home, where you wet the bed.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.823
Why are you talking about wetting a bed in front of a restaurant?!

10:36.736 --> 10:38.538
Oh, wow.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.842
That little bed-wetting Kazuo has grown up!

10:42.642 --> 10:44.643
Bed-wetter!

10:44.644 --> 10:47.345
You wore Kazumi's underwear home, right?

10:47.346 --> 10:48.548
Panties!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.049
I don't remember that...

10:50.149 --> 10:52.551
It happened so long ago, he wouldn't remember.

10:52.651 --> 10:53.553
Yes...

10:53.653 --> 10:55.555
But Kazuo back then was so funny...

10:55.655 --> 10:58.557
Kazumi! Don't go around embarrassing the man.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.559
But...

10:59.759 --> 11:01.461
Embarrassing man!

11:01.561 --> 11:03.601
Want to eat some? I remember you used to like soba.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.065
Kazuo has turned into a udon enthusiast.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.167
Udon?

11:07.267 --> 11:11.471
How did that happen?
They don't have a good soba shop in Onomichi?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.174
Actually, there was a good udon shop.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.075
Udon and soba are both kneaded with water.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.578
I know, Kazumi.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.980
Why don't you take Kazuo to the Spring of Sabishira?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.482
It might bring back memories.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.685
The Spring of Sabishira?
- Sa-Bi-Shi-Ra?

11:25.785 --> 11:28.687
It's a spring where we get the water for our soba.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.190
Don't you remember going there when we were kids?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.926
No... sorry.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.727
Then, go take him there, Kazumi.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.731
We'll have delicious soba prepared when you get back.

11:38.931 --> 11:44.924
You're the one who's supposed to treat me to soba.
( Old Japanese tradition: the new arrival makes soba for neighbors. )

11:47.607 --> 11:50.809
Shall we go? Into the world of our story?

11:50.909 --> 11:52.346
OK.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.039
Be careful!

11:55.146 --> 11:57.139
We'll be back soon.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.921
I'm glad she's playing outside.

12:02.922 --> 12:06.924
Unlike me, she totally lacks masculinity!

12:07.760 --> 12:09.762
Masculinity!

12:10.062 --> 12:11.763
This way, Kazuo.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.733
Huh? Oh.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.636
How big is your family?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.838
Let's see... my dad, mom,

12:19.839 --> 12:22.741
grandpa, and an older brother.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.244
But my brother is working in Tokyo,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.746
and we're taking care of his only daughter, Kazuko.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.549
Her mom passed away.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.352
Then, it's a family of 6, including you.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.455
Yes, since you killed my grandma.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.357
What? Hold on...

12:37.757 --> 12:40.360
The Spring of Sabishira.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.663
Is your family just you and both of your parents?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.765
No, it's a family of 2.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.766
This way,

12:47.767 --> 12:49.170
it's up there.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
Do you remember anything?

12:52.872 --> 12:54.365
No.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.814
Male's Gate and Female's Gate.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.816
You're a boy, so...

13:04.817 --> 13:06.410
this way.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.809
Kazuo, the water here is really great!

13:34.814 --> 13:37.016
That's also why our soba tastes great.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.109
I see.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.824
You really don't remember?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.826
My grandpa took us here

13:47.827 --> 13:50.320
many times when we were little.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.840
I remember very clearly while you don't remember at all.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.477
Isn't that unfair?

14:05.277 --> 14:06.746
I wonder why?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.883
Maybe I was trying hard to forget about you.

14:10.983 --> 14:14.253
Because you'd miss me if you remember? Or...

14:14.453 --> 14:17.746
because you wanted to forget about killing my grandma?

15:30.830 --> 15:32.931
<i>My mind went blank.</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:35.033
<i>I went home...</i>

15:35.034 --> 15:37.327
<i>without knowing what just happened.</i>

16:30.300 --> 16:33.700
( Notice of store closure... )

16:49.641 --> 16:52.141
Kazuo, did you just get back?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.205
It's so hot in here.

17:10.429 --> 17:11.731
You!

17:12.631 --> 17:14.034
Me?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.436
Ow.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.339
Gone...

17:20.740 --> 17:22.142
It's gone!

17:23.041 --> 17:26.046
Why are you making so much noise, Kazuo?

17:27.000 --> 17:27.701
Who are you?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.048
- Mom...
- Mom?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.251
Kazuo! He brought a weird girl home on the moving day?

17:33.252 --> 17:36.054
Half-naked too... what are you doing?!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.456
Where are you, Kazuo?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.057
I'm Kazuo...

17:39.058 --> 17:40.959
I don't know who you are, but...

17:40.960 --> 17:42.761
Aren't you ashamed of being naked like that?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.764
What have you been doing with my Kazuo?!

17:44.964 --> 17:46.666
What have I been doing?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.968
I went to the Spring of Sabishira with Kazumi and...

17:49.068 --> 17:51.069
Kazumi? Is that...

17:51.070 --> 17:53.666
That Kazumi from the Saitou soba restaurant?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.276
You're Kazumi?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.477
But why aren't you wearing anything?

17:58.478 --> 17:59.971
It's not like that...

18:00.000 --> 18:03.393
Anyway, do something about your appearance!

18:08.000 --> 18:10.002
Now tell me, where's Kazuo?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.091
Where?

18:14.093 --> 18:17.486
Wait, Kazumi!
Where are you going, dressed like that?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.933
What's on earth is this?
Kazumi?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.826
Just tell me, what happened to Kazumi?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.528
Is she safe?

18:49.128 --> 18:52.032
I'm telling you mommy, I'm Kazumi!

18:53.132 --> 18:56.636
He probably bumped his head against a rock!

18:57.136 --> 18:58.938
Grandpa!

18:59.038 --> 19:00.840
Idiot, look how pathetic you're making me look!

19:00.841 --> 19:02.344
Stop crying like a wuss!

19:02.444 --> 19:04.044
It's me, Kazumi's body!

19:04.200 --> 19:05.803
This one's Kazumi too!

19:06.044 --> 19:07.246
Get off me!

19:07.346 --> 19:10.950
Kazumi, why are you dressed like that?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.151
Geez, Kazumi.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.755
Your mom is scary despite her appearance!

19:15.955 --> 19:17.557
That... that's not true!

19:17.657 --> 19:19.659
You're still saying things like that?!

19:19.759 --> 19:21.761
Mom, don't hit me!

19:22.061 --> 19:24.664
Don't scar a girl before she finds a man!

19:24.764 --> 19:26.966
Exactly, grandpa is right, old lady.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.868
"Old lady"?!
- Old lady?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.001
Mom, stop it!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.104
This is hopeless!

19:31.170 --> 19:32.607
Wait, Kazumi!

19:34.707 --> 19:36.877
Bag, take your bag!

19:38.177 --> 19:39.770
This is hopeless!

19:44.283 --> 19:45.987
Get on.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.091
Not like that! Open your legs.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.984
Hold on.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.999
What a ridiculous double ride!

20:00.199 --> 20:02.200
Wait, that's against the law!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.694
Wait!

20:13.112 --> 20:15.314
Hey, put your hands down.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.117
It hurts when someone grabs my boobs.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.619
Perv! You played with my breasts, didn't you?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.323
"My breasts"?

20:21.419 --> 20:23.323
Well, they may belong to you,

20:23.419 --> 20:25.421
but they're on me right now.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.826
You can have them back if you want!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
But in exchange, give me back my nuts!

20:29.929 --> 20:32.331
You scum, idiot, pervert!

20:32.431 --> 20:34.033
Knock it off!

20:34.133 --> 20:36.135
And what's with this appearance?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.038
My panties are clearly showing!

20:39.138 --> 20:41.141
Fine, sorry about that!

20:41.841 --> 20:43.843
But... what now?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.499
My mom was telling me to go home,

20:47.500 --> 20:51.304
but I don't even know where you live!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.353
Right...

20:54.053 --> 20:57.055
Anyway, just for today...

20:57.056 --> 20:59.057
I'll be you, and you'll be me.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.060
There's nothing else we can do.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.763
Let's walk.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.965
We're not kids.

21:06.050 --> 21:07.752
Whether it's dream or reality,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.060
let's just think it through.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.402
My home is this way.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.483
What are we going to do?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.183
Let's discuss it inside.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.676
We've got to do something about this.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.191
Where have you been hiding for so long?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.892
It's not like that, mom.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.094
This is Kazumi, and I'm Kazuo!

21:36.095 --> 21:38.097
This girl is still not making any sense.

21:38.098 --> 21:41.101
Stop trying to seduce my Kazuo!

21:41.301 --> 21:43.303
What's wrong, Kazuo?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.105
No! This is Kazumi!

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308
I'm sorry, Kazumi. Please leave for today.

21:49.408 --> 21:51.101
Hang in there!

22:03.522 --> 22:05.226
This is yours, isn't it?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.719
Go home already!

22:28.748 --> 22:31.650
Excuse me... I mean, I'm home.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.548
Thank you for waiting.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.762
Where have you been?

22:41.862 --> 22:44.463
I told you to enter from the back during this time.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.466
We have customers here!

22:47.466 --> 22:49.469
Hurry and eat dinner.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.062
Why did you bring back the dipper?

22:54.674 --> 22:57.676
Tell grandpa to take this back tomorrow.

22:57.776 --> 22:58.779
OK.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.472
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.498
Auntie ate mine!

23:18.596 --> 23:19.797
Call me sis.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.200
I'm the only child.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.204
You don't even like oyster mushrooms.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.405
It's first come, first serve today!

23:26.406 --> 23:28.108
Kazumi, get me the rice.

23:28.208 --> 23:30.410
Your mom is busy cleaning up the restaurant.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.803
Fine...

23:41.220 --> 23:42.713
Another bowl!

24:28.400 --> 24:30.202
What's wrong, Kazumi?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.671
No appetite today?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.274
No...

24:34.674 --> 24:36.467
Her stomach is growling!

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
I finally finished cleaning up!

25:00.599 --> 25:02.401
Kazumi...

25:02.501 --> 25:04.402
I'm glad you can eat oyster mushrooms, but...

25:04.403 --> 25:08.105
you're a girl! Where are your manners?

25:08.106 --> 25:09.808
Go back to your own seat.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.410
That way, auntie!

25:11.510 --> 25:12.611
Come on...

25:12.612 --> 25:13.614
Sake...

25:16.214 --> 25:17.807
For me too.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.833
I'm home!

25:35.933 --> 25:38.735
I talked to our landlord after greeting the neighbors.

25:38.736 --> 25:42.629
She happens to be a quite a talker!
I ended up having a long chat with her.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.543
This bar used to be very popular in the past,

25:45.544 --> 25:50.148
but they got beaten by new competition nearby.

25:50.550 --> 25:55.254
"An old woman like me can't keep up with the trends",
she said with a smile.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.556
Look, she gave me some persimmon!

25:57.956 --> 25:59.958
Sorry I'm late, you must be hungry.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.561
Should we just order some noodles?

26:03.961 --> 26:05.564
Where did you get this?

26:05.864 --> 26:07.466
I made it.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.859
<i>You</i> did? By yourself?

26:12.671 --> 26:13.964
Yes.

26:14.171 --> 26:16.864
Feeling depressed will only make me even sadder.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.578
Sorry for using the food without asking you.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.582
What? You always take the food without asking!

26:23.682 --> 26:27.884
I asked the landlord to leave her old appliances here.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.389
Oh, yes... right.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.791
By the way, what do you have to be depressed about?

26:32.891 --> 26:34.892
About Akemi?

26:34.893 --> 26:36.595
Or that weird Kazumi?

26:36.695 --> 26:38.499
Who's Akemi?

26:40.799 --> 26:42.803
You miss her after all!

26:44.703 --> 26:48.505
You must be doing all this because you're worried about me.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.211
No, I'm just trying to imitate other people's cooking.

26:52.411 --> 26:56.404
Really? But sometimes it tastes horrible when you do that!

26:59.818 --> 27:01.520
Wow, it tastes great!

27:01.620 --> 27:03.621
What's gotten into you, Kazuo?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.424
- Is it good?
- Yes!

27:05.524 --> 27:06.926
Then I'm relieved.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.428
- By the way...
- Yes?

27:09.528 --> 27:11.629
Daddy... I mean,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.532
When's dad coming home?

27:13.632 --> 27:17.536
Kazuo, are you still saying that to hurt my feelings?

27:17.636 --> 27:21.040
No, um, err...

27:21.540 --> 27:24.543
You're being so difficult lately.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.579
You even brought some weird girl home.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.680
All this stress...

27:29.681 --> 27:32.374
it's a great diet!

27:35.687 --> 27:39.391
Let's eat. I'm happy my son cooked for me.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.284
Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.391
Ah, TV!

27:55.073 --> 27:57.074
What are you doing, I turned it on.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.777
This is my TV time.

27:59.778 --> 28:01.580
I don't care.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.782
Kazumi, it's not your turn.

28:04.783 --> 28:08.576
You guys actually have a rule like that?
- What's gotten into you?

28:09.788 --> 28:11.189
Never mind.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.496
Don't worry, I'll do the dishes.

28:17.996 --> 28:21.498
Hey, Kazuo, you can watch the bar's TV.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.702
TV?

28:22.802 --> 28:25.704
What's it called? That classical music show you watch every week.

28:25.804 --> 28:28.706
You know, the one you used to watch with Akemi.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.311
She must be the reason you started learning piano.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.712
Akemi is good at everything,

28:34.713 --> 28:37.715
good mannered. I really liked her.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.709
I hope you'll make a friend like her in this school too.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.724
Right... but I'll clean these.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.718
Oh? But you don't have to worry about me.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.234
Doing something is better than nothing.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.537
Actually, I need to use the bathroom first...

28:58.737 --> 29:01.440
Huh? You don't have to ask me.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.143
Oh, right.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.645
Well then...

29:06.745 --> 29:09.747
Don't read books in there!

29:09.748 --> 29:11.750
I'm using it soon too.

29:11.950 --> 29:16.952
Geez, where did he pick up that strange habit?

29:19.758 --> 29:22.760
"The Sickness Unto Death"?

29:22.761 --> 29:25.763
"Kierkegaard", what a weird name.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.166
I thought this would relax me, but it's the complete opposite!

29:29.167 --> 29:30.801
Auntie, are you done yet?

29:30.802 --> 29:33.804
Kazumi, how long are you going to be in there?

29:33.805 --> 29:35.408
Diarrhea?

29:36.908 --> 29:38.776
What's that?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.778
What's with you?

29:40.779 --> 29:43.781
When did you start reading books in the bathroom?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.783
When? I have for a long time...

29:45.784 --> 29:48.785
Whatever, hurry and use it.

29:48.786 --> 29:50.789
I'm also waiting for the bathroom.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.182
Kazumi, show me that book.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.787
I'll go after you.
- You can go before me...

30:00.799 --> 30:02.701
Where's the phone?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.802
What's wrong with you, Kazuo?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.596
The phone is over there.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.114
He's strange tonight.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.717
Why are you just sitting there, Kazumi?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.818
Hurry and clean up, then make tea for everyone.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.622
And what's with this disturbing book?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.823
Something Unto Death?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.025
I have to make tea?

30:27.026 --> 30:29.728
Of course! And what's with the boy talk?

30:29.828 --> 30:32.830
(Girl Talk:) I have to make tea?
- Yes.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.734
Don't worry about the tea, get the phone.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.337
Damn, what a busy house.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.038
What are you doing? Get the phone!

30:41.039 --> 30:42.741
Right, phone...

30:42.841 --> 30:45.444
She must have bumped her head too.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.537
I'll make tea!

30:54.853 --> 30:57.846
Where's the phone...

30:59.858 --> 31:02.261
Oh, here it is.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.663
Hello?

31:04.763 --> 31:06.765
It's me, Kazumi.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.866
I know that, it's my own voice.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.270
Kazuo, there's an emergency with your body.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.373
Emergency?

31:12.473 --> 31:15.576
The shape... suddenly changed!

31:15.676 --> 31:17.078
Shape? What shape?

31:17.176 --> 31:18.578
Where you pee from...

31:18.678 --> 31:21.081
Idiot! Don't play with that!

31:21.178 --> 31:24.781
But... I only wiped it with toilet paper after going...

31:24.883 --> 31:26.884
It started to change shape.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.886
Idiot, who wipes that with paper?

31:28.887 --> 31:33.180
Just swing it a couple of times and put it back in!

31:33.892 --> 31:35.594
Don't do funny stuff to it!

31:35.694 --> 31:37.398
I got it.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.601
But <i>you</i> have to use the paper.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.104
Fine.

31:44.204 --> 31:46.907
Hey, how's it going at your end?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.803
Ain't so bad, I guess.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.408
You can't talk like that!

31:51.409 --> 31:52.910
Anyway, what about you?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.115
Everything going well?

31:54.311 --> 31:56.815
I cooked something, and we ate together, but...

31:56.915 --> 32:01.117
your mom seemed to be surprised at how fast I ate.

32:01.118 --> 32:01.919
Really...

32:01.920 --> 32:04.923
You know how I have a big family.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.416
If you don't eat quickly...

32:09.923 --> 32:11.816
There will be none left.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.932
I know what you mean. It took a while to grab the food.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.938
You have to eat properly

32:19.938 --> 32:22.072
It's my body.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.941
But I'm a bit relieved.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.944
You're calm enough to cook.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.949
I'll try to think of something about our situation.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.051
- That and...
- Yes?

32:34.151 --> 32:36.354
Did you see a cell phone in my pocket?

32:36.454 --> 32:37.955
There was.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.659
But it's all wet, so the memory is all gone.

32:41.660 --> 32:42.461
It doesn't matter.

32:42.462 --> 32:44.498
But the strap...

32:45.998 --> 32:48.966
Oh, this? The piano-shaped one?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.402
Can you keep it somewhere safe?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.504
Is it a gift from someone important?

32:52.804 --> 32:54.073
This Akemi person?

32:54.173 --> 32:57.576
No, it's from my pops.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.078
From your father?

32:59.278 --> 33:01.880
Well then, I'm going to hang up.
Take care.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.682
You too.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.075
Bye.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.691
What, again?

33:12.991 --> 33:15.694
What, you still have something to say?

33:16.194 --> 33:18.797
It's Kazumi... right?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.998
Oh, ah... Yes.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.434
It's me, Hiroshi.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.237
Oh, Hiroshi is that...

33:25.238 --> 33:28.907
class president, Kazumi's boyfriend, show-off, Yamamoto Hiroshi?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.410
What's the matter? You're acting strange today, Kazumi.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.011
I'm not acting strange, damn it.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.414
(Girl Talk:) I mean... I'm not strange.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.013
There's definitely something wrong.

33:37.014 --> 33:40.017
I called your cell phone many times, but it wouldn't connect, so I called your home.

33:40.019 --> 33:43.020
Oh, my cell... It's in my home...

33:43.021 --> 33:44.023
Huh?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.825
(Girl talk:) It was soaked in water.

33:46.925 --> 33:49.928
Soaked?
- I went to the Spring of Sabishira.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.030
You know, I took the transfer student, Kazuo there.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.734
Then I fell in the water.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.936
Really? I hope you're not hurt.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.037
Duh, that's why I'm home.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.040
Right... I don't mean to be rude,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.944
but is this another one of your stories?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.045
Huh, uh, um...

34:08.045 --> 34:10.047
(Unnatural girl Talk:) This is truth it is.

34:10.047 --> 34:13.050
(Girl Talk:) Kazuo is very strong.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.054
(Girl Talk:) He saved me.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.056
Something's definitely wrong.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.558
I'm coming over right now.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.058
No, no, don't come!

34:21.059 --> 34:23.260
- Please don't come!
- But...

34:23.261 --> 34:25.062
Don't worry, I'm just tired.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.065
Maybe that's why I'm a bit nervous.

34:28.065 --> 34:31.168
So you don't need to come tonight.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.170
I see...

34:33.170 --> 34:35.175
Then... rest well.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.676
Do you think you can come to school tomorrow?

34:38.677 --> 34:39.978
I think so.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.972
Bye, good night.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.598
Who was it?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.201
Such a long call.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.003
It was Hiroshi.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.106
You've had a long day, go to sleep.

35:09.106 --> 35:12.109
Don't forget to greet grandma before going to sleep.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.913
Ask her to heal your head.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.115
Grandma's still alive?

35:17.215 --> 35:20.018
What is she talking about?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.111
That's a tough book.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.816
Tie your sash properly!

35:30.128 --> 35:32.131
This way, go.

35:33.331 --> 35:37.324
Pray that you'll feel better tomorrow.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.939
I'm sleeping here?!

35:41.039 --> 35:44.042
What? You have your own room.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.845
Now, give her a greeting.

35:48.145 --> 35:51.645
( Random chanting... )

35:54.352 --> 35:57.055
Kazuo, are you asleep?

35:57.155 --> 36:00.158
No, what is it?

36:00.558 --> 36:04.195
I ironed your uniform.

36:04.295 --> 36:06.064
Oh, thanks!

36:06.164 --> 36:10.157
I'll also iron that weird Kazumi's uniform.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.073
I found her cell phone too, but it's broken.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.275
But return it tomorrow.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.878
Who knows how that crazy girl will react?

36:20.178 --> 36:23.282
Really, I can't believe she turned out to be such an annoying kid.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.075
Ah! Hot, hot, hot!

36:59.818 --> 37:00.819
Kazuo.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.637
Oh, you're here?

37:05.456 --> 37:09.158
Are you crazy? You can't wear that to school.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.261
I've brought your uniform.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.263
Your mom washed it for you.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.935
Here's your precious cell phone strap,

37:17.035 --> 37:18.537
and my broken cell phone.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.740
I can't get the buttons on!

37:22.240 --> 37:24.843
What are you doing? Wear a bra underneath!

37:24.943 --> 37:26.445
People can see my breasts!

37:26.545 --> 37:27.547
Calm down.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.147
Over there, in the top drawer.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.847
What's that?
- Don't touch that!

37:44.762 --> 37:46.355
Help me with this.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.768
Good morning, Kazumi.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.771
How are you feeling?

37:53.071 --> 37:55.073
You? What are you doing?

37:55.173 --> 37:58.476
Mom, I always tell you to knock before entering my room!

37:58.876 --> 38:01.079
What about you?

38:01.179 --> 38:03.281
Entering a girl's room this early in the morning?

38:03.381 --> 38:07.285
Uh, I came to bring his cell phone strap and uniform.

38:07.385 --> 38:11.184
She came because she was worried I suddenly turned into a girl.

38:11.185 --> 38:12.687
You don't have to get all mad.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.893
Who do you think you're talking to?

38:15.093 --> 38:17.697
And why aren't you wearing anything?

38:19.197 --> 38:22.200
What did you do that for, old lady?!
- Kazuo, stop!

38:22.300 --> 38:24.303
What did you just call me?

38:25.303 --> 38:28.304
Why are you here in my daughter's room?

38:28.305 --> 38:30.309
Do you think this is appropriate?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.344
Honey!

38:33.444 --> 38:35.915
This is inappropriate too!

38:39.017 --> 38:41.119
What's going on?!

38:41.419 --> 38:43.421
Your skirt is on backwards.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.724
Oops.

38:48.426 --> 38:51.630
Are the folks in your home going to be alright?

38:52.230 --> 38:55.234
They're fine. It happens all the time.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.037
Oh.

38:59.237 --> 39:02.941
You may be good at these things,

39:03.041 --> 39:08.043
but I'm not used to living in an unrealistic situation like this.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.350
What's wrong?

39:12.450 --> 39:16.254
I'm starting to want to kill myself.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.356
Whoa, don't be absurd!

39:18.357 --> 39:21.058
What will happen to me if you died?

39:21.059 --> 39:24.063
Your body belongs to me.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.565
I know that.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.267
Good morning.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.368
Let's just go to the school.

39:31.369 --> 39:35.170
Good morning.

39:35.171 --> 39:36.572
(Girl Talk:) Let's go.

39:36.573 --> 39:37.574
(Girl Talk:) Yes.

39:37.575 --> 39:39.276
(Boy Talk:) I mean, Yes.

39:39.277 --> 39:40.879
Is that correct?

39:41.079 --> 39:43.079
Ah! I missed breakfast!

39:43.479 --> 39:44.883
I'm hungry.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.793
- Kazumi and...
- Kazuo!

39:56.294 --> 39:58.296
All rise,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.397
bow.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.399
Good morning.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.404
Morning!

40:03.500 --> 40:05.104
Sit down.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.406
For today's music lesson...

40:09.407 --> 40:12.409
Let's enjoy...

40:12.410 --> 40:15.013
a piano performance first!

40:15.413 --> 40:17.406
Yay!

40:22.720 --> 40:24.322
Saitou.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.423
Yes.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.426
Oh, I wasn't calling you, Kazumi.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.230
It's Saitou Kazuo.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.665
Saitou Kazuo actually happens to be

40:34.666 --> 40:37.937
a great piano player from Onomichi.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.441
Isn't that right?

40:42.741 --> 40:44.742
Don't be shy.

40:44.743 --> 40:48.736
Well then, Kazuo. Go ahead.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.992
Come on, Kazuo.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.694
The piano is waiting for you.

41:03.794 --> 41:07.787
Kazuo, you can do it!

41:13.405 --> 41:15.407
What's wrong, Kazuo?

41:15.507 --> 41:18.510
You're good at piano, right?

41:18.810 --> 41:23.312
Come on, Kazuo. Like a hero from Kazumi's fairy tale...

41:23.482 --> 41:27.175
Play the piano like a prince!

41:29.487 --> 41:31.488
(Boy Talk:) What are you doing?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.893
Just spread your fingers, hit the keys and it'll make sound!

41:35.093 --> 41:39.097
Do-re-mi or Flea Waltz, or whatever, just play you idiot!

41:39.497 --> 41:41.098
(Girl Talk:) How can you expect me

41:41.099 --> 41:43.100
to actually play the piano all of a sudden?

41:43.101 --> 41:44.803
This is all your fault

41:45.003 --> 41:48.039
for learning piano without telling me.
Idiot!

41:50.339 --> 41:51.508
Oh, crap!

41:51.509 --> 41:53.011
Kazuo!

41:53.111 --> 41:56.113
Time-out for a sec.
Kazumi, wait! Don't kill yourself!

42:01.720 --> 42:03.723
Watch over the class.

42:04.323 --> 42:06.316
Quiet down.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.938
Hey...

42:20.538 --> 42:22.031
Wait.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.547
Hey, Kazumi.

42:30.147 --> 42:31.549
What's the matter?

42:31.649 --> 42:36.542
It's not fair. Piano is not a part of my fairy tale.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.556
But Akemi taught me...

42:39.557 --> 42:41.558
Hey there!

42:41.559 --> 42:43.560
What's going on here?

42:43.561 --> 42:46.563
Kazumi, I thought I heard you scream

42:46.564 --> 42:48.565
"don't kill yourself"...

42:48.566 --> 42:50.259
What's going on?

42:55.124 --> 42:56.373
Kazuo.

42:57.330 --> 43:00.576
It's not like a boy to be crying like that.

43:00.678 --> 43:02.682
What exactly is the problem?

43:04.782 --> 43:06.384
Hey, Kazuo.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.586
Stop that.

43:08.686 --> 43:10.166
Stop, you idiot!

43:13.246 --> 43:14.692
Oh, crap!

43:15.092 --> 43:17.085
Are you alright, teacher?

43:27.004 --> 43:29.397
What the hell? Move it!

43:32.910 --> 43:35.412
Ow, move it.

43:36.514 --> 43:37.516
Don't look!

43:37.614 --> 43:39.015
Take your head out of my skirt!

43:39.016 --> 43:40.618
It's all dark, I can't see anything.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.620
But that was kind of hot.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.723
Geez, that hurt.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.624
Hiroshi?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.618
Oh my god!

43:59.270 --> 44:01.138
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.142
I don't know what I would do if it left scars.

44:04.542 --> 44:07.545
Hiroshi didn't even help, he was just staring.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.682
Hiroshi likes watching doesn't he?

44:11.582 --> 44:15.075
I want to get back into this body.

44:26.864 --> 44:29.567
Cute boy and girl.

44:29.667 --> 44:34.060
The short days of autumn are sad, aren't they?

44:36.574 --> 44:39.677
Young girl, you have a small frame,

44:39.777 --> 44:43.281
but a nice proportion.

44:43.481 --> 44:47.774
Why don't you take my hand and come with me?

44:48.686 --> 44:50.687
Someone,

44:50.688 --> 44:52.690
someone help!

44:52.790 --> 44:54.592
Why are you screaming?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.693
I have nothing to do with you.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.695
Go away!

44:58.696 --> 45:00.697
Stop!

45:00.698 --> 45:01.800
What are you doing?

45:02.000 --> 45:05.003
What a creepy kid, go away!

45:05.703 --> 45:07.405
Kazumi!

45:07.605 --> 45:10.198
You OK? Why you...

45:13.944 --> 45:15.447
Hurry, let's go.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.149
I can't breathe...

45:17.249 --> 45:19.442
Open your legs.
- It's too embarrassing.

45:19.500 --> 45:20.993
Just do it!

45:24.622 --> 45:26.524
- Is that better?
- A bit...

45:26.724 --> 45:29.127
Let's get away while he's still down.

45:29.927 --> 45:31.620
Here's a bonus!

45:34.932 --> 45:37.925
Autumn days... are painful...

45:45.042 --> 45:49.644
Actually, Saitou and Saitou were...

45:49.747 --> 45:53.750
about to engage in red entertainment...

45:53.751 --> 45:55.752
Pinku entertainment, you mean.

45:55.753 --> 45:59.156
Yes, pinku entertainment when...

45:59.256 --> 46:05.249
the president of Educational Committee's grandson came to warn them...

46:05.762 --> 46:09.955
One of the Saitou kicked his...

46:12.469 --> 46:15.469
important place!

46:15.773 --> 46:16.774
You fool!

46:16.775 --> 46:20.810
Anyway, my son's...

46:20.811 --> 46:23.780
that place is internally bleeding.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.983
He had to take a leave of absence from university too.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.785
How will you take responsibility for this?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.787
He's a university student?

46:30.788 --> 46:34.190
Excuse me, my child is a girl.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.694
There is no way a girl can do something like that to a big university student.

46:37.794 --> 46:40.929
I'm sure Kazuo was the one who did it.

46:41.631 --> 46:43.700
Saitou? Did you do it?

46:43.800 --> 46:44.802
Well...

46:44.902 --> 46:48.305
Kazuo, tell me. What happened?

46:48.307 --> 46:51.808
That bastard was staring at me with a really dirty look!

46:51.809 --> 46:53.611
If we didn't get him,

46:53.701 --> 46:56.704
he would've rubbed this whole body, took off my panties, and...

46:56.814 --> 46:58.816
Kazumi! Stop it already!

46:58.916 --> 47:00.618
But...

47:02.420 --> 47:07.613
In any case, I believe Kazuo was simply trying 
to protect Kazumi from being assaulted.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.427
And Mr. Committee,

47:09.527 --> 47:12.729
your grandson kicked Kazuo's nuts first.

47:12.829 --> 47:14.832
Watch your language!

47:14.932 --> 47:17.735
It's true! That's why we kicked him back.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.137
I guess it's self-defense.

47:20.237 --> 47:21.739
That's hard to believe...

47:22.239 --> 47:23.741
President Imada.

47:23.841 --> 47:26.843
Let's just say we've both suffered damage.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.346
Our students may have been partially responsible, but

47:29.348 --> 47:32.851
if this gets out to the public, 
it will affect your grandson's future career.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.952
Of course it will!

47:34.953 --> 47:37.454
If the public found out a university student

47:37.455 --> 47:40.358
got beaten by a junior high girl... Right?

47:40.858 --> 47:42.251
Thanks, mom.

47:45.963 --> 47:47.756
That's not your mom.

47:57.875 --> 47:59.877
They bought you a new cell phone?

47:59.977 --> 48:02.780
Yeah, your mom said I'm strange lately,

48:02.880 --> 48:06.882
so she bought it for me so she can contact me anytime.

48:06.883 --> 48:07.884
Oh, my mom said that?

48:07.885 --> 48:10.387
Oh, crap! It's that kid Hiroshi!

48:10.388 --> 48:11.390
Let me see!

48:11.490 --> 48:14.891
"I called your home, and they told me you've got a new cell phone."

48:14.892 --> 48:16.893
I'm really worried about your abnormal behavior

48:16.894 --> 48:19.562
ever since Kazuo transferred to our school.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.399
Is there anything I can do to help?

48:21.499 --> 48:24.802
"Or am I no longer needed by you?"

48:24.902 --> 48:26.138
Hiroshi...

48:26.238 --> 48:29.208
I'll type it for you. What do you want to say?

48:29.308 --> 48:31.307
I'm sorry for making you worry.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.910
It's not that I no longer need you.

48:33.911 --> 48:37.914
No, in fact, I think I need you most by my side right now, star-mark.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.416
But please give me a bit more time.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.951
Please don't forget, star-mark,

48:41.952 --> 48:45.945
you're the most important person to me, OK, 3 question marks.

48:51.128 --> 48:54.932
Then, I want you to remember this, star-mark.

48:54.933 --> 48:57.934
I am always by your side.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.936
I'll die just for you, star-mark.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.341
OK?

49:03.041 --> 49:06.543
"I'll die just for you"?

49:06.544 --> 49:08.947
That line sounds like a big lie, huh?

49:09.947 --> 49:12.640
Ow, what the hell?

49:22.460 --> 49:23.961
"Thank you,"

49:23.962 --> 49:26.263
I think I will be able to tell you everything one day.

49:26.264 --> 49:29.765
Please look after me from a distance until then.

49:29.766 --> 49:31.346
"Goodbye."

49:33.971 --> 49:37.074
You have to be the one holding this cell phone.

49:37.174 --> 49:39.877
Oh, right.

49:39.977 --> 49:43.579
I promise I'll contact you if he sends mail again.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.774
Thanks.

49:52.089 --> 49:57.894
<i>There is a petition to have Zenkouji shrine nominated as a World Heritage Site...</i>

49:57.895 --> 50:00.096
Why are you lying around like that?

50:00.097 --> 50:02.098
You're acting like a boy!

50:02.099 --> 50:07.501
Kazumi, you weren't like this until that boy transferred here.

50:07.606 --> 50:12.108
That's why, I want you to stop hanging around with Kazuo for a while.

50:12.109 --> 50:14.110
What? But...

50:14.111 --> 50:18.114
That's what we've decided.
I also discussed this with Kazuo's mom.

50:18.115 --> 50:22.118
She told me you were wandering around their home naked.

50:22.119 --> 50:24.421
Turn off the TV when you're not watching.

50:24.422 --> 50:25.923
But that was because I fell in the water...

50:25.924 --> 50:30.828
In any case, you two are bad influences on each other.

50:31.028 --> 50:34.131
Listen, I know you can't help it inside the school,

50:34.132 --> 50:37.831
but once you get out of the school, you're forbidden to hang around Kazuo.

50:37.832 --> 50:39.032
Forbidden.

50:39.136 --> 50:43.071
You, give her an earful as a father too!

50:44.076 --> 50:47.077
What do you say, Kazumi?
Want to make some soba again?

50:47.078 --> 50:47.777
Honey?

50:47.778 --> 50:49.978
Soba? Kazumi can make soba?

50:50.080 --> 50:53.082
It's true making soba is a man's job,

50:53.083 --> 50:56.085
but I'm an incompetent apprentice of your grandfather's.

50:56.086 --> 51:00.090
He always teases me that you're better at making soba than me.

51:00.091 --> 51:03.093
I guess it's what they call "the talent skipped a generation"

51:03.193 --> 51:06.096
But I like the soba you make.

51:06.196 --> 51:10.000
Thank you, you're the only person who tells me that.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.101
What do you say, Kazumi?

51:12.102 --> 51:13.604
Want to give it a try?

51:13.704 --> 51:16.607
OK, it's same as udon, right?

51:16.707 --> 51:18.700
Yeah... huh?

51:25.082 --> 51:27.081
Oh, Kazumi. Want to give it a try?

51:27.082 --> 51:28.082
Yes.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.381
Raise your arms.

51:38.896 --> 51:40.389
You're good to go.

51:51.809 --> 51:54.211
It's same as udon, just as I thought.

51:54.411 --> 51:56.304
- Here you go.
- Got it.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.530
Ka... Kazumi?! What are you doing?!

52:13.130 --> 52:15.132
What's wrong?

52:15.232 --> 52:16.934
Huh? Am I doing it wrong?

52:17.034 --> 52:18.937
Auntie, you look awesome!

52:20.137 --> 52:22.138
Dad, dad?

52:22.139 --> 52:24.141
- Are you alright?
- No...

52:41.357 --> 52:43.961
Is this all my fault?

52:45.361 --> 52:47.363
Why is the restaurant closed?

52:47.463 --> 52:49.065
Welcome.

52:49.165 --> 52:51.166
What's wrong with you, Kazumi?

52:51.167 --> 52:52.167
I'm not a customer.

52:52.168 --> 52:54.169
Welcome home, dad!

52:54.170 --> 52:56.171
This is for you. - "Dad"?

52:56.172 --> 52:58.075
You're Kazumi's older brother?

52:58.175 --> 53:01.176
Mom told me you're acting strange lately, so I came to see how you're doing.

53:01.177 --> 53:03.179
It seems she was right.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.781
Are you practicing for the school play?

53:04.782 --> 53:08.785
Kouichi, Kouichi! She made soba with her feet!

53:09.000 --> 53:10.302
With her feet?!

53:10.387 --> 53:11.689
Is that true, Kazumi?

53:11.787 --> 53:13.689
Well, that's what we do for udon.

53:13.789 --> 53:17.082
That's why her dad and grandpa both fell into a state of shock.

53:18.907 --> 53:20.926
I see...

53:21.181 --> 53:23.786
But I guess you're trying to make soba your way.

53:23.886 --> 53:24.889
Huh?

53:24.989 --> 53:26.694
That's a great thing.

53:26.794 --> 53:30.433
I wasn't interested in making soba,
so I ran off to Tokyo, but

53:30.434 --> 53:32.437
it seems you like making soba.

53:32.438 --> 53:35.444
You might even become a pioneer of female soba masters.

53:35.445 --> 53:40.419
To achieve your goal... do whatever you need to, even with your feet!

53:41.323 --> 53:43.227
You have my support.
- Kouichi...

53:43.327 --> 53:44.330
Honey!

53:44.428 --> 53:45.231
OK.

53:45.431 --> 53:48.137
You're pretty understanding, bro!

53:48.237 --> 53:49.741
Understanding!

53:49.941 --> 53:52.445
Well then, I still have homework to do.

53:52.446 --> 53:54.449
I'm going back to my room.

53:54.450 --> 53:56.254
Kazumi, wait.

53:56.354 --> 53:58.358
Help me clean the restaurant.

53:58.458 --> 53:59.863
I'll help out too.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.365
Me too!

54:09.381 --> 54:11.419
Kazumi, are you alright?

54:11.520 --> 54:14.326
Yeah, I just felt a bit dizzy.

54:14.426 --> 54:15.497
Don't worry.

54:15.527 --> 54:18.000
It should still be a while until your next period.

54:18.500 --> 54:21.440
Period? I'm going to have periods?

54:21.540 --> 54:23.444
Of course you will.

54:23.545 --> 54:27.542
Give me a time-out. I'll go downstairs in a while.

54:33.665 --> 54:36.037
See? She's acting strangely.

54:36.137 --> 54:37.541
You might be right.

54:37.639 --> 54:39.042
Strange.

54:43.352 --> 54:45.455
Do you see a pretty pouch in the drawer?

54:45.456 --> 54:47.594
My sanitary pads are inside.

54:47.695 --> 54:49.564
What am I going to do?

54:49.565 --> 54:53.873
Your mom tells me I can't see you anymore.

54:53.973 --> 54:56.178
Your mother told me the same thing.

54:56.278 --> 54:58.382
Don't panic during your period.

54:58.484 --> 55:00.389
It only happens once a month.

55:00.486 --> 55:02.791
Oh, right. Our field trip is coming up.

55:02.792 --> 55:04.430
I'll show you how to use them then.

55:04.530 --> 55:06.300
Field trip?

55:06.400 --> 55:08.205
Oh, it's your first time.

55:08.305 --> 55:12.110
It's our school's annual event.
The entire class stays overnight somewhere.

55:12.111 --> 55:14.015
This year it's at Shimao Hot Spring.

55:14.115 --> 55:16.519
I don't care where we're going anymore.

55:16.520 --> 55:18.824
I feel so tired tonight.

55:18.825 --> 55:20.530
As if I'm sick.

55:20.630 --> 55:23.135
You're just not used to it.
It's not a sickness.

55:23.235 --> 55:28.242
Well, at least now the over-energetic Saitou Kazumi can finally calm down for a bit.

55:28.246 --> 55:30.250
I guess it worked out for the best.

55:30.351 --> 55:33.357
Hello? Hello?

55:33.457 --> 55:34.961
Are you listening to me, Kazuo?

55:35.259 --> 55:39.566
Yeah, I'm listening. I really don't feel very good.

55:39.669 --> 55:42.675
I'm going to hang up now, good night.

55:42.875 --> 55:44.870
Oh, good night..

55:52.294 --> 55:53.998
Kazuo, can I come in?

55:54.098 --> 55:54.999
Yes.

55:55.099 --> 55:58.105
I see swimsuit in the list of things to bring for the field trip...

55:58.106 --> 56:00.011
You're actually going to swim in this weather?

56:00.111 --> 56:02.616
Oh, we wear it for the hot spring.

56:02.716 --> 56:04.621
Swimsuit for the hot spring?

56:04.721 --> 56:08.026
Yes, that's what we've always done in our school.

56:08.126 --> 56:09.631
"What we've always done"?

56:09.731 --> 56:12.637
Uh, that's what I heard from my friends.

56:12.737 --> 56:16.543
Oh. I've heard kids nowadays aren't used to shared baths,

56:16.544 --> 56:18.950
so they wear swimsuits for hot springs.

56:19.050 --> 56:21.355
You used to share baths naked?

56:21.455 --> 56:24.661
Oh, I almost forgot. We have to buy you a new swimsuit.

56:24.763 --> 56:27.666
The old one was getting a bit small, right?

56:27.766 --> 56:29.261
Uh... I think so.

56:42.100 --> 56:45.806
Saitou, what do you think of the mountains in Shinshuu?

56:45.906 --> 56:48.912
It's your first time, right? Aren't they beautiful?

56:49.012 --> 56:50.252
Yes.

56:52.754 --> 56:56.026
Saitou? What's wrong?

56:56.027 --> 56:57.765
You don't seem as energetic as usual.

56:57.865 --> 57:01.036
She's fine. Kazumi is a quiet girl, isn't she?

57:01.136 --> 57:03.143
You think?

57:04.044 --> 57:06.049
Are you alright, Saitou?

57:07.350 --> 57:10.356
I think this is the first time I've seen you get car sick.

57:10.456 --> 57:11.760
I'm having my period.

57:11.860 --> 57:13.061
Idiot!

57:13.662 --> 57:15.664
Kazuo!

57:23.384 --> 57:25.389
I got mine on! Let's go!

57:25.689 --> 57:28.695
Can you help me with mine?
- Sure.

57:29.596 --> 57:32.592
Yuuka, have your breasts gotten bigger again?

57:40.117 --> 57:42.123
Kazumi, are you alright?

57:43.124 --> 57:46.721
Gently tap her behind her neck.

57:54.948 --> 57:55.951
Saitou,

57:55.952 --> 57:58.256
Maybe you should rest up in your room.

57:58.356 --> 58:00.761
No, I'm fine.

58:00.961 --> 58:03.967
Ah... but maybe I should.

58:03.968 --> 58:07.975
Girls at your age have delicate bodies.

58:08.177 --> 58:10.773
Right, yes.

58:16.995 --> 58:20.001
Hey? Kazumi?

58:20.102 --> 58:22.106
You can play piano?

58:22.206 --> 58:23.210
Uh... no.

58:23.307 --> 58:25.712
I can tell from your finger's movements.

58:25.713 --> 58:29.310
But.. why have you never told me?

58:31.026 --> 58:35.033
It's a secret, but I used to play piano too.

58:35.133 --> 58:36.937
Used to?

58:37.037 --> 58:39.240
Because I quit.

58:39.241 --> 58:41.045
How come?

58:41.145 --> 58:44.152
Because I broke up with the person who loved piano.

58:44.252 --> 58:46.958
- For such a reason?
- It's fine!

58:47.058 --> 58:49.863
Learning and quitting piano...

58:49.864 --> 58:52.068
is all for the person you love.

58:52.168 --> 58:54.974
What kind of tunes did you like?

58:55.578 --> 58:59.072
Schumann's Novelletten.

59:06.096 --> 59:09.103
Oh, mom bought you a new pair of swim pants, huh?

59:10.004 --> 59:11.007
Perv!

59:11.108 --> 59:14.113
You must have gotten the nosebleed from
watching girls change and got too excited.

59:14.213 --> 59:16.018
Well, it's a gold mine!

59:16.218 --> 59:18.022
Geez!

59:18.122 --> 59:19.061
Ow!

59:19.123 --> 59:21.163
What an overreaction!

59:22.765 --> 59:26.162
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

59:28.043 --> 59:30.047
What are you doing? Perv!

59:30.147 --> 59:32.152
Kazuo?

59:34.357 --> 59:38.365
I'll carry her, you get the teacher.

59:40.167 --> 59:43.172
Hang on, help is coming.

59:43.275 --> 59:46.282
Hiroshi... you're making me blush.

59:48.184 --> 59:50.187
She's fine now.

59:50.188 --> 59:52.392
Her complexion has improved a lot too.

59:52.393 --> 59:54.196
I'll stay by her.

59:54.197 --> 59:56.200
All of you, return to your rooms.

59:56.201 --> 59:58.205
It's better to give her some quiet time.

59:58.606 --> 59:59.609
OK.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.114
Let's go.

01:00:02.214 --> 01:00:04.218
Hang in there!

01:00:04.318 --> 01:00:06.323
Dinner's at 6PM.

01:00:07.424 --> 01:00:09.429
Take care.

01:00:11.432 --> 01:00:12.436
Bye.

01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:16.934
Saitou,
I need to talk to you.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.845
Uh, OK.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.134
It's almost dinner time.

01:00:30.571 --> 01:00:32.177
Kazumi.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:34.294
Yes?

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.988
Oh, uh...

01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:40.193
I know that you're Kazumi.

01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:42.198
Isn't that right?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.007
You and Saitou Kazuo switched bodies somehow.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:53.719
That's the only explanation I can think of,
 by observing you two.

01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:56.627
But... how did you know?

01:00:57.027 --> 01:00:59.634
It's love.

01:01:00.835 --> 01:01:02.440
Love?

01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:05.045
Love is philosophy.

01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:09.697
Even if it cannot be scientifically explained,
it can be by the philosophy of love.

01:01:09.943 --> 01:01:10.956
Hiroshi...

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.554
 The person I love is...

01:01:14.613 --> 01:01:18.020
You, Kazumi.

01:01:18.377 --> 01:01:19.582
Me?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.179
Me, inside me?

01:01:21.279 --> 01:01:23.883
I can't stop loving you.

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:27.892
And even if the Kazumi I love is shaped like a man,

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.934
I can accept that.

01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:34.807
Because I love your soul.

01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:37.011
Hiroshi.

01:01:37.111 --> 01:01:40.108
Kazumi, Kazumi.

01:02:13.036 --> 01:02:16.032
<i>Suddenly...</i>

01:02:35.132 --> 01:02:38.129
<i>I can't see you anymore</i>

01:02:44.584 --> 01:02:47.580
<i>Starting tomorrow</i>

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:54.688
<i>I won't be able to see you again</i>

01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:04.298
<i>I won't be able to</i>

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.959
<i>See you again</i>

01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:15.116
<i>Even if I prayed for it</i>

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:26.727
What's the matter?

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:28.976
I would've even understood it if you said

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:32.785
"Your forehead is cute" or
"I like the shape of your jaw."

01:03:32.853 --> 01:03:36.850
But how can you possibly see my soul?

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.586
You're in love with your own soul.

01:03:50.688 --> 01:03:53.695
Not mine, not Kazumi's.

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:56.994
Even if it was, it's the ideal me in your mind.

01:04:04.618 --> 01:04:07.324
That's not the real me.

01:04:07.424 --> 01:04:09.419
Not this Kazumi.

01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:21.070
I'm not philosophical like you.

01:04:22.751 --> 01:04:27.757
<i>You will become a wind</i>

01:04:28.758 --> 01:04:34.965
<i>Become an invisible wind</i>

01:04:36.566 --> 01:04:42.573
<i>To your most sought after place</i>

01:04:43.073 --> 01:04:49.881
<i>You will become a wind and reach</i>

01:04:51.582 --> 01:04:57.589
<i>Don't laugh and say I'm strange</i>

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:04.596
<i>It's slightly embarrassing</i>

01:05:05.821 --> 01:05:13.821
<i>You can see through everything</i>

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.013
<i>That's why</i>

01:05:21.114 --> 01:05:29.114
<i>I'm leaving you now...</i>

01:05:31.198 --> 01:05:33.201
Kaneko, Kawahara,

01:05:33.202 --> 01:05:34.605
Kita,

01:05:34.705 --> 01:05:36.107
Kuroda,

01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:37.210
Kobayashi,

01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:40.918
Saitou, Saitou Kazumi?

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:41.734
Yes.

01:05:41.739 --> 01:05:43.143
Not you.

01:05:43.423 --> 01:05:47.120
Saitou Kazumi is... absent.

01:05:48.534 --> 01:05:50.539
Sakui,

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.044
Sawada,

01:05:53.244 --> 01:05:55.239
Shiina...

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:01.160
Kazumi is sleeping.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:04.267
She's acting strange, more than usual!

01:06:04.367 --> 01:06:08.407
I can't let you see her even if you come all this way to visit.

01:06:08.676 --> 01:06:10.781
So, please. Leave.

01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:14.378
Let's go, Kazuko.

01:06:21.301 --> 01:06:22.807
Kazumi.

01:06:24.909 --> 01:06:26.414
Hiroshi.

01:06:27.615 --> 01:06:30.320
My mom won't let me see Kazuo.

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:33.626
I've never had to sleep in because of my period.

01:06:33.627 --> 01:06:37.435
I'm really worried about what's happening to my body.

01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:39.136
OK.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.343
I'll go visit.

01:06:41.344 --> 01:06:44.250
I promised to do anything for you.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.353
Please do that for me.

01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:49.662
I'm sure my mom will let you see me.
- Yes.

01:06:50.563 --> 01:06:52.567
Sorry for making you worry.

01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:56.301
I'm fine, 
but Kazumi is worried about your body.

01:06:56.302 --> 01:06:57.869
Kazumi is...

01:06:58.016 --> 01:07:01.385
Does that mean Kazumi told you?

01:07:01.386 --> 01:07:02.417
No.

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.167
Kazumi's stories are always very imaginative,

01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:09.001
and although they were amusing, 
I've always thought them to be slightly immature.

01:07:09.002 --> 01:07:10.505
But I noticed...

01:07:10.506 --> 01:07:12.910
That song you sang most recently...

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:15.014
The song...

01:07:15.015 --> 01:07:18.022
It came naturally to me.

01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:22.674
That song was like one of Kazumi's stories.

01:07:22.675 --> 01:07:24.479
It sounded as if Kazumi had made it.

01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:26.136
You may be right

01:07:26.137 --> 01:07:31.045
It felt as if I was her when I was singing it.

01:07:31.749 --> 01:07:35.755
Hiroshi, thank you for visiting.

01:07:36.058 --> 01:07:38.754
Please keep her company.

01:07:41.971 --> 01:07:44.477
Come on, talk about something.

01:07:46.079 --> 01:07:48.083
Would you like some snacks?

01:07:48.183 --> 01:07:50.379
Yes, thank you.

01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:02.747
It reminds me of the time when my dad used to hold me.

01:08:03.448 --> 01:08:06.154
We're not equipped to treat her here.

01:08:06.155 --> 01:08:08.158
I will recommend you to a hospital in Nagano.

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:11.667
Please consult with an expert from there.

01:08:11.767 --> 01:08:15.764
It's such a difficult disease to treat?
- Yes...

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:22.051
I will arrange a full medical examination in 2 or 3 days.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:24.158
Please be prepared to stay in the hospital.

01:08:24.258 --> 01:08:25.252
OK.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.205
She has a very rare illness.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.912
We have also never encountered it before in our hospital.

01:08:50.011 --> 01:08:51.814
And the treatment?

01:08:51.816 --> 01:08:55.011
You can cure it, right?
- About that...

01:08:57.527 --> 01:09:03.037
Director, they are the parents of the patient.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:05.944
Oh, you're that...

01:09:06.045 --> 01:09:09.352
Committee president! 
You're a doctor in this hospital?

01:09:09.452 --> 01:09:11.154
Yes...

01:09:11.171 --> 01:09:14.178
Does that mean, that lively girl...

01:09:14.883 --> 01:09:17.870
Doctor, you can cure Kazumi's illness, right?

01:09:17.995 --> 01:09:20.200
Dr. Mizutani, you still haven't...?

01:09:20.274 --> 01:09:21.279
No.

01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:29.026
Sir, with the current medical technology,
 you're daughter's illness can't...

01:09:29.027 --> 01:09:32.310
What? 
It can't be cured?

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:33.301
But...

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:36.207
Are you just saying that because of our history?

01:09:36.308 --> 01:09:39.313
You're just saying that to scare us, right?

01:09:39.314 --> 01:09:42.319
It's nothing more than a light anemia,

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:46.328
and you're trying to make her suffer.

01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:48.662
Isn't that right?

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:52.340
Madam, 
I'm a doctor.

01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:57.248
I would never lie or joke to a patient's family!

01:09:57.545 --> 01:09:59.853
But...

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:03.955
But she's still only 15!

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.373
Honey...

01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:10.878
she's only 15...

01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:12.874
15...

01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:18.394
Doctor,

01:10:18.395 --> 01:10:21.401
how long...

01:10:21.402 --> 01:10:24.007
How long does Kazumi have?

01:10:24.408 --> 01:10:27.413
I cannot guarantee it,

01:10:27.414 --> 01:10:29.318
but most likely...

01:10:30.033 --> 01:10:32.715
2 to 3 months.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.736
That... 
that can't be...

01:10:39.473 --> 01:10:42.680
We will do all we can.

01:10:43.381 --> 01:10:48.356
 But the support of family and friends 
will be more reassuring than anything else.

01:10:48.758 --> 01:10:50.461
I know it must be tough,

01:10:50.462 --> 01:10:52.457
but let's give it our best.

01:10:55.172 --> 01:10:57.376
- Hi.
- Committee president?

01:10:57.476 --> 01:11:01.484
Thanks to you giving my grandson a beating,

01:11:01.485 --> 01:11:04.489
we found out more and more of his wrongdoings.

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:06.494
He had been skipping university,

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:09.401
and hanging around with trouble-making friends of his.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.509
See, told you it was that punk's fault.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.415
You're right!

01:11:15.715 --> 01:11:20.522
That severe injury turned out to be a good lesson for him!

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:22.428
I think he's learnt his lesson.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.532
It's all thanks to you.

01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:28.540
So I am indebted to you.

01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:31.447
I'll do my best in your treatment.

01:11:31.547 --> 01:11:35.444
You're going to grab my boobs 
and say it's an examination, aren't you?

01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:38.462
You got me!

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:41.167
Well, I might have to touch a little.

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:44.673
Anyway, can you do something about this kindergarten-like room?

01:11:44.773 --> 01:11:47.479
It's bringing back the memory of getting my wee-wee pulled.

01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:50.422
Oops, she already took mine.

01:11:51.723 --> 01:11:54.594
Patients 15 and under are considered pediatrics...

01:11:54.595 --> 01:11:56.598
But I'll move you to an adult's room.

01:11:56.599 --> 01:11:59.604
OK. Fine, I'll let you touch my boobs.

01:11:59.605 --> 01:12:01.609
It seems like you're a nice person.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.613
Well, thank you.

01:12:03.614 --> 01:12:06.619
Let's try to get along.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.623
Let's give it our best.

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:09.919
OK.

01:12:14.637 --> 01:12:17.642
It can't be cured?
Does that mean I'm going to die?

01:12:17.643 --> 01:12:21.149
Kazumi's body will die... 
What about Kazuo?

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:23.416
What will happen to Kazuo?

01:12:23.456 --> 01:12:25.459
Kazumi's body will die,

01:12:25.659 --> 01:12:28.665
that means Kazuo inside will also die.

01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.604
That's the most logical conclusion.

01:12:30.704 --> 01:12:33.431
I can't live on if Kazuo dies.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:34.634
What should I do,

01:12:34.798 --> 01:12:36.293
What should I do?

01:12:40.368 --> 01:12:41.862
Keep still.

01:12:53.352 --> 01:12:56.348
Here, it's from Kazuko to "auntie".

01:13:00.732 --> 01:13:03.028
Sorry to trouble you, Hiroshi.

01:13:06.945 --> 01:13:08.551
Dr. Mizutani.

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:12.257
Who's that boy?

01:13:12.357 --> 01:13:16.365
Oh, he stares at Saitou's room from there every day,

01:13:16.366 --> 01:13:18.369
but it seems he caused some trouble in the past.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:20.674
Her family members won't give him permission to visit.

01:13:20.774 --> 01:13:22.069
Hold this.

01:13:34.503 --> 01:13:39.011
You're Saitou, right?

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.510
Yes.

01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:47.330
Why are you here.

01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:49.434
You can't see her.

01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:53.040
Madam, if you're avoiding him because of that incident,

01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:54.945
I'll apologize on his behalf.

01:13:54.946 --> 01:13:56.650
I want him to talk to Kazumi.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.854
I can't allow that.

01:13:58.955 --> 01:14:02.360
Chie, let him visit.

01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:04.366
But honey...

01:14:04.466 --> 01:14:09.073
Doesn't Kazumi need the support of as many friends as possible?

01:14:09.276 --> 01:14:11.280
Let him visit her.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.377
Will you see Kazumi for us?

01:14:24.707 --> 01:14:26.302
Kazuo?

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.925
It's me.

01:14:32.021 --> 01:14:33.527
Come on, now.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.135
Oh, right. 
It's Kazumi.

01:14:37.735 --> 01:14:40.441
My mind is dull.

01:14:40.842 --> 01:14:42.846
It's the medicine's side effect.

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:45.050
What exactly happened?

01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:47.455
I don't know.

01:14:47.555 --> 01:14:51.561
It just turned out this way.

01:14:52.565 --> 01:14:54.069
Forgive me.

01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:56.473
How did this happen,

01:14:56.474 --> 01:14:57.877
Kazuo?

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:00.582
I don't know.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:06.792
It feels like I was suddenly thrown into a whole different world.

01:15:07.198 --> 01:15:11.204
Kazuo, is there anything I can do for you?

01:15:11.205 --> 01:15:14.812
You're me, so I'll do anything for you.

01:15:15.613 --> 01:15:17.617
Tell me if you need anything.

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:19.420
Don't push yourself too hard.

01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:21.526
- I'm fine.
- But...

01:15:21.626 --> 01:15:23.730
that's my body.

01:15:23.731 --> 01:15:27.138
I should be the one lying down there.

01:15:27.338 --> 01:15:29.743
Why are you sick instead?

01:15:29.796 --> 01:15:31.801
It can't be helped.

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:34.152
We've switched.

01:15:34.653 --> 01:15:37.658
I'm you right now.

01:15:37.659 --> 01:15:39.663
I'm the one who got sick.

01:15:39.763 --> 01:15:41.567
But...

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:45.975
Do you remember that kid Hiroshi saying that corny line?

01:15:46.578 --> 01:15:49.785
"I'll die just for you".

01:15:50.686 --> 01:15:52.981
What a joke.

01:15:54.795 --> 01:15:58.003
But I guess he's a nice guy.

01:15:59.705 --> 01:16:03.502
"I'll die just for you", huh?

01:16:04.916 --> 01:16:06.921
I'm sorry.

01:16:07.421 --> 01:16:09.426
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

01:16:10.527 --> 01:16:12.532
Why are you apologizing?

01:16:12.732 --> 01:16:15.537
Is there anything you want,

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.777
or person you want to see?

01:16:18.678 --> 01:16:20.681
Person I want to see?

01:16:20.682 --> 01:16:21.952
Of course it's...

01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:24.057
I know...

01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:27.563
Of course.

01:16:27.763 --> 01:16:30.359
You want to see your mom.

01:16:32.774 --> 01:16:35.479
I thought I said you're not allowed to see Kazumi.

01:16:35.579 --> 01:16:37.684
But she really wants to see you.

01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:39.787
Why does she want to see me?

01:16:39.788 --> 01:16:41.791
She said because you took care of her...

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:43.796
I never took care of her.

01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:47.404
I don't see a reason for me to see Kazumi either.

01:16:47.504 --> 01:16:49.909
You just want to use me to see her, 
isn't that right?

01:16:50.009 --> 01:16:52.515
That's not fair, mom!

01:16:52.815 --> 01:16:55.821
That's 378 yen. Thank you.

01:16:56.021 --> 01:16:57.924
Anyway, Kazuo.

01:16:57.925 --> 01:16:59.528
I got a phone call from Akemi.

01:16:59.529 --> 01:17:02.535
She's coming here to visit you in the winter break.

01:17:02.736 --> 01:17:04.139
Akemi's coming?

01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:05.643
I know you want to see her.

01:17:05.743 --> 01:17:09.151
You'll completely forget about Kazumi once she's here.

01:17:09.851 --> 01:17:11.856
Do you know how I can contact her?

01:17:11.956 --> 01:17:16.362
What? Have you forgotten 
how to contact your own girlfriend?

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:19.562
Yeah... 
my old cell phone got soaked in water.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:38.609
Kazuo!

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:41.105
Are you Yoshino Akemi?

01:17:49.633 --> 01:17:52.639
Oh, you really are Kazuo.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.344
Well, I guess it's Kazuo's body.

01:17:55.345 --> 01:17:56.849
So that's not a surprise.

01:17:56.949 --> 01:18:00.355
So, you understood what I explained in the email?

01:18:00.455 --> 01:18:01.958
Vaguely,

01:18:01.959 --> 01:18:03.962
but it's obvious when I see you in person.

01:18:03.963 --> 01:18:05.901
You're not Kazuo.

01:18:06.001 --> 01:18:08.873
I see, 
you can also tell.

01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:12.080
Nice to meet you,
I'm Saitou Kazumi.

01:18:12.181 --> 01:18:14.785
He's Yamamoto Hiroshi from my class.

01:18:14.986 --> 01:18:17.793
Nice to meet you, 
I'm Yamamoto Hiroshi.

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.900
Ah, so you're my rival in love.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.404
I guess so.

01:18:23.504 --> 01:18:29.113
I cried for a whole night after you told me Kazuo might die.

01:18:29.215 --> 01:18:31.018
I kept crying,

01:18:31.019 --> 01:18:35.026
and played Schumann's Traumerei, 
the piece I always played with Kazuo, through the night.

01:18:35.027 --> 01:18:37.030
But it won't change anything.

01:18:37.031 --> 01:18:40.037
So I thought I have to make his last wish come true.

01:18:40.038 --> 01:18:43.043
That I have my own duty.

01:18:43.044 --> 01:18:45.048
Am I just trying to satisfy myself?

01:18:45.448 --> 01:18:47.954
I'm only here because Akemi asked me,

01:18:48.054 --> 01:18:51.059
but why do I have to come along?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.266
Come on, mom.

01:18:52.366 --> 01:18:55.869
It's true, I knew her when she was in kindergarten, but...

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:57.975
I hope I won't cry.

01:18:58.075 --> 01:18:59.881
It's better if you cry!

01:19:02.884 --> 01:19:06.891
Hello, Kazumi. 
I'm Yoshino Akemi.

01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:09.131
Akemi...

01:19:09.231 --> 01:19:11.803
I've brought Kazuo's mom too.

01:19:11.903 --> 01:19:15.099
Kazuo and Hiroshi asked me to bring her.

01:19:16.413 --> 01:19:17.314
Mom...

01:19:17.414 --> 01:19:19.409
Go ahead.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:23.227
Kazumi,

01:19:23.327 --> 01:19:25.733
it's been a long time.

01:19:26.133 --> 01:19:28.739
You were so energetic...

01:19:29.039 --> 01:19:31.044
Mom...

01:19:31.144 --> 01:19:33.147
How are you doing with Kazuo?

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:36.154
Huh? Uh, yes.

01:19:36.254 --> 01:19:39.962
But he also doesn't seem to be very energetic lately.

01:19:40.162 --> 01:19:41.567
Oh.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.068
But...

01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:46.075
please get along

01:19:46.175 --> 01:19:49.783
Kazuo hates being lonely.

01:19:50.183 --> 01:19:51.787
OK.

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.191
We get along very well.

01:19:54.192 --> 01:19:55.596
He's my son, after all.

01:19:55.693 --> 01:19:57.197
Right...

01:19:57.198 --> 01:19:59.202
He's your son.

01:19:59.302 --> 01:20:01.740
She's Akemi.

01:20:01.741 --> 01:20:04.245
Kazuo's friend.

01:20:04.246 --> 01:20:08.255
She came all the way from Onomichi to see him.

01:20:08.355 --> 01:20:11.127
I've heard from Kazuo...

01:20:11.227 --> 01:20:13.531
about everything, all of it.

01:20:13.632 --> 01:20:15.335
Everything, all of it?

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:18.342
Yes, everything, all of it.

01:20:18.442 --> 01:20:21.947
That's why I brought his mom here today.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:25.056
I see, that explains it.

01:20:25.556 --> 01:20:28.002
Thank you, Akemi.

01:20:33.974 --> 01:20:35.214
What are you two talking about?

01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:37.380
About something important,

01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:39.888
between me and Kazuo.

01:20:41.289 --> 01:20:45.787
I'm glad... 
I got to see Kazuo's mom.

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.321
Really?

01:20:56.421 --> 01:20:59.126
It's kind of strange...

01:20:59.127 --> 01:21:01.331
but I'm glad I could be of help.

01:21:01.631 --> 01:21:04.536
Then, I'll say a couple more strange things...

01:21:04.537 --> 01:21:07.243
Take care, mom.

01:21:07.444 --> 01:21:10.283
And also...

01:21:10.284 --> 01:21:13.256
You should fall in love with someone too.

01:21:13.356 --> 01:21:16.361
Geez, Kazumi!

01:21:16.362 --> 01:21:19.559
You're not making any sense as usual.

01:21:34.298 --> 01:21:35.201
Mom...

01:21:35.302 --> 01:21:36.207
Kazuo's...

01:21:36.303 --> 01:21:39.310
I'm sorry Kazuo is always causing trouble.

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:42.416
Not at all. 
You came all the way here to visit?

01:21:42.516 --> 01:21:48.325
It felt as if I was talking to my own child while I was with her.

01:21:48.463 --> 01:21:52.760
I'm sorry. 
You have my condolences.

01:21:53.339 --> 01:21:56.345
I am grateful for your heartfelt visit.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.249
Grateful.

01:22:00.251 --> 01:22:01.656
Auntie?

01:22:02.457 --> 01:22:05.462
Kazumi is young, 
so she can endure our treatment.

01:22:05.464 --> 01:22:10.472
She may even regain her strength temporarily.

01:22:10.475 --> 01:22:14.317
But after that short period of time...

01:22:14.433 --> 01:22:17.135
It's best to ask her what she wants to do,

01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:20.024
who she wants to see, while she still can.

01:22:20.272 --> 01:22:22.176
Ah! Dad.

01:22:22.177 --> 01:22:23.894
Kazuko.

01:22:25.614 --> 01:22:26.918
Brother.

01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:28.405
Yes?

01:22:29.012 --> 01:22:30.516
Bro...

01:22:30.817 --> 01:22:32.320
What is it?

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.826
How did Kazuko's mom die?

01:22:35.227 --> 01:22:36.730
What?

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:40.037
Sorry for asking a strange question.

01:22:40.237 --> 01:22:43.242
No problem, 
Kazumi.

01:22:43.243 --> 01:22:46.350
I don't know the answer to that question either.

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:52.257
Why Yuriko went shopping by herself on that day, 
that afternoon,

01:22:52.258 --> 01:22:55.264
and had to be hit by a car...

01:22:56.169 --> 01:22:59.176
By a drunk driver, no less.

01:22:59.276 --> 01:23:00.981
But you know,

01:23:01.078 --> 01:23:04.185
I know very well what she lived for.

01:23:04.887 --> 01:23:06.893
It's Kazuko.

01:23:07.493 --> 01:23:11.601
Kazuko is here because we loved each other.

01:23:12.303 --> 01:23:14.307
Kazumi.

01:23:14.308 --> 01:23:16.811
No one knows why people die.

01:23:16.812 --> 01:23:18.315
Maybe it's fate.

01:23:18.316 --> 01:23:20.820
But you decide what you're living for.

01:23:20.821 --> 01:23:23.360
I guess that's why we fall in love.

01:23:23.561 --> 01:23:26.233
That's why, you have to live.

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:28.471
Live your own way.

01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:30.743
Give it a try.

01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:33.548
Brother.

01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:36.253
I'm glad I'm your sister.

01:23:36.754 --> 01:23:39.250
Try to live, sis.

01:23:45.306 --> 01:23:47.210
Are you feeling well today?

01:23:47.634 --> 01:23:52.942
Yeah, I feel well on some days.

01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:55.452
Doesn't last long though.
- I see.

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.732
Can you open the curtains?

01:23:58.733 --> 01:23:59.937
I want to see the sky.

01:24:00.037 --> 01:24:01.332
Sure.

01:24:05.514 --> 01:24:07.519
We're pretty high up...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.024
Kazumi.

01:24:10.124 --> 01:24:11.528
What?

01:24:12.228 --> 01:24:15.134
There's somewhere I want to go to.

01:24:15.235 --> 01:24:17.239
You want to go somewhere?

01:24:17.339 --> 01:24:19.744
Let's go then.

01:24:20.345 --> 01:24:21.649
Do you think we can?

01:24:21.747 --> 01:24:23.051
Where, Kazuo?

01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:24.946
Let's just go!

01:24:39.385 --> 01:24:40.588
Let's go.

01:24:41.289 --> 01:24:42.983
From the emergency stairs.

01:25:03.735 --> 01:25:05.430
Come, hurry.

01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:13.457
Over there.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.263
- Akemi.
- Huh?

01:25:17.764 --> 01:25:19.169
Kazumi.

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:22.475
I can walk from here.

01:25:23.776 --> 01:25:25.781
Kazuo...

01:25:27.585 --> 01:25:29.389
Are you alright?

01:25:29.489 --> 01:25:31.083
I'm alright.

01:25:35.903 --> 01:25:37.606
Kazuo, are you really alright?

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:39.310
Kazuo?

01:25:40.812 --> 01:25:42.707
Sorry for the trouble.

01:25:47.426 --> 01:25:49.932
Hurry up!

01:25:50.032 --> 01:25:53.538
I'll get disowned if my father finds out about this.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.345
That's better than having your attempted rape exposed.

01:25:56.445 --> 01:25:59.451
What you're doing is called blackmail!

01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:01.255
I'll give you a kiss as a reward.

01:26:01.353 --> 01:26:02.254
Yeah!

01:26:02.456 --> 01:26:04.852
Why is this happening to me...

01:26:07.769 --> 01:26:09.473
Hey, Hiroshi.

01:26:09.571 --> 01:26:10.473
Yes?

01:26:10.474 --> 01:26:13.080
What's "The Sickness Unto Death" about?

01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:15.395
- It's about despair.
- Despair?

01:26:15.484 --> 01:26:17.388
Despair destroys people.

01:26:17.488 --> 01:26:19.092
What about hope then?

01:26:19.197 --> 01:26:21.602
"It is too difficult to understand, I don't know",

01:26:21.797 --> 01:26:23.401
my grandpa said.

01:26:23.501 --> 01:26:25.105
Your grandpa?

01:26:25.205 --> 01:26:27.608
He kept reading that book until he died at 94,

01:26:27.609 --> 01:26:30.415
"I am counting on you to figure out the rest".

01:26:30.616 --> 01:26:34.112
I wonder if hope lies in what's left.

01:26:49.755 --> 01:26:51.559
Is this far enough?

01:26:51.659 --> 01:26:53.463
Yes, thanks.

01:26:53.563 --> 01:26:56.469
Geez, kids these days!

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:59.575
I'm not involved anymore.

01:26:59.576 --> 01:27:01.514
You're responsible for yourselves.

01:27:01.614 --> 01:27:03.318
Thanks.

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:05.322
What about that kiss?

01:27:05.522 --> 01:27:07.526
I don't want it!

01:27:07.626 --> 01:27:10.623
The arrival of winter sure is sad!

01:27:29.009 --> 01:27:31.248
This is as far as we'll go.

01:27:31.249 --> 01:27:32.719
Yes.

01:27:33.175 --> 01:27:35.079
Aren't we going together?

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.455
You two go together.

01:27:37.555 --> 01:27:40.561
You two are protagonists of the same story.

01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:43.867
I'm sure there are many things you two want to discuss alone.

01:27:44.069 --> 01:27:45.272
Akemi...

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.205
Kazuo,

01:27:46.273 --> 01:27:48.377
we didn't get to talk too much,

01:27:48.378 --> 01:27:51.183
but I'll never forget you.

01:27:51.184 --> 01:27:52.988
I'm going to quit piano.

01:27:53.188 --> 01:27:56.594
That way I can treasure the memories of us together.

01:27:56.696 --> 01:27:58.679
Thank you, Akemi.

01:28:02.107 --> 01:28:03.210
Hiroshi...

01:28:03.308 --> 01:28:04.610
Be careful.

01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:07.917
Call the ambulance immediately if something goes wrong.

01:28:08.015 --> 01:28:09.519
Yes.

01:28:22.549 --> 01:28:24.486
<i>And so, Kazuo and Kazumi</i>

01:28:24.487 --> 01:28:26.488
<i>walked the divine path.</i>

01:28:26.489 --> 01:28:30.162
<i>They walked endlessly through the buckwheat field</i>

01:28:30.465 --> 01:28:33.470
We're also all alone now.

01:28:33.471 --> 01:28:36.376
Two walking the divine path, two lost love.

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.679
Isn't that right?

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:38.880
Yes.

01:28:39.683 --> 01:28:42.679
Might as well share the same umbrella,

01:28:43.492 --> 01:28:45.496
and write our own story.

01:28:45.697 --> 01:28:47.702
Yes,

01:28:48.503 --> 01:28:52.500
but you won't surpass Kazumi. I'm certain.

01:28:53.713 --> 01:28:56.209
Kazuo either, huh?

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:08.545
Hey Kazuo.

01:29:08.646 --> 01:29:10.912
I lied to you about one thing.

01:29:11.048 --> 01:29:11.750
What is it?

01:29:11.751 --> 01:29:14.256
That you killed my grandma.

01:29:14.257 --> 01:29:16.261
Let's not mention her.

01:29:16.361 --> 01:29:19.867
I think this is happening to me because of her curse.

01:29:19.969 --> 01:29:21.371
No, it's not.

01:29:21.372 --> 01:29:23.877
Grandma was already dead when it happened.

01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:25.201
From a heart attack.

01:29:25.298 --> 01:29:28.405
We saw her while my mom went to get the doctor.

01:29:28.487 --> 01:29:30.392
You were lying to me the whole time?

01:29:30.489 --> 01:29:31.593
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

01:29:31.693 --> 01:29:34.297
But I only lied to you because

01:29:34.298 --> 01:29:37.302
I wanted you to be a special person in my story.

01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:38.409
I know that now.

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.311
A special person, huh?

01:29:40.411 --> 01:29:43.217
But meanwhile, you were trying to forget about me.

01:29:43.317 --> 01:29:46.323
That's also because I wanted to make you a special person.

01:29:51.434 --> 01:29:53.438
OK, let's get going soon.

01:29:53.538 --> 01:29:55.032
OK.

01:29:58.448 --> 01:30:00.755
Where are you kids going?

01:30:01.656 --> 01:30:03.751
Want to come with us?

01:30:17.622 --> 01:30:20.393
We're performing in a hot spring inn.

01:30:20.394 --> 01:30:21.797
What about you?

01:30:21.895 --> 01:30:23.299
Uh, yes.

01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:26.406
We're planning to go there too.

01:30:26.506 --> 01:30:27.711
How lucky.

01:30:27.808 --> 01:30:28.812
Kazuo?!

01:30:28.967 --> 01:30:31.372
Oh? Then let's make it a nice trip.

01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:32.155
Yes.

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:34.557
Are you sure, boss? I think they're runaways.

01:30:34.657 --> 01:30:37.528
You can only be reckless when you're young.

01:30:37.529 --> 01:30:39.433
You've done the same thing, haven't you?

01:30:39.533 --> 01:30:42.539
I'm 2 tens and a five...

01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:44.444
A young man.

01:30:44.544 --> 01:30:46.448
But they seem like junior high students.

01:30:46.548 --> 01:30:50.555
Fool, they have a reason they can't tell others.

01:30:50.556 --> 01:30:54.063
The girl seems to be sick too.

01:30:54.064 --> 01:30:56.068
Let's take care of them.

01:30:56.168 --> 01:30:56.971
Yes, sir.

01:30:57.069 --> 01:30:59.276
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

01:31:00.077 --> 01:31:01.315
Eat this.

01:31:01.378 --> 01:31:03.918
Thank you, we'll have it.

01:31:05.421 --> 01:31:08.394
Wow, you can become an actor.

01:31:08.494 --> 01:31:09.196
Huh?

01:31:09.295 --> 01:31:13.701
People are born with certain qualities.

01:31:14.506 --> 01:31:17.511
I'm playing a female role after years of training,

01:31:17.512 --> 01:31:21.220
but you're born with the quality needed for female roles in Kabuki.

01:31:21.514 --> 01:31:23.518
Would you like to enter this career?

01:31:23.525 --> 01:31:25.529
Uh, no... I...

01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:28.234
That suits him! It might be perfect for him!

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:29.639
Stop it!

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.242
That movement!

01:31:32.243 --> 01:31:34.582
You're like a pro. Don't you agree, boss?

01:31:34.682 --> 01:31:38.379
What, you want to make him your successor?

01:31:50.681 --> 01:31:53.387
Thank you so much for coming.

01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:06.705
I slay you!

01:32:12.332 --> 01:32:17.330
I live for love!

01:32:22.494 --> 01:32:26.091
I wonder if she's already asleep?

01:32:27.658 --> 01:32:30.064
Hey, are you asleep?

01:32:30.065 --> 01:32:31.070
No.

01:32:32.266 --> 01:32:34.272
Can I go to your room?

01:32:34.372 --> 01:32:36.076
I can't seem to fall asleep.

01:32:36.177 --> 01:32:38.173
Yes, sure.

01:32:44.468 --> 01:32:46.172
Kazumi.

01:32:46.307 --> 01:32:47.265
Yes?

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:49.234
Can I join you?

01:32:49.555 --> 01:32:50.458
What?

01:32:50.739 --> 01:32:53.644
Don't worry, I won't try anything funny.

01:32:54.748 --> 01:32:55.752
OK.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:00.064
Then...

01:33:01.986 --> 01:33:03.767
can I hug you?

01:33:03.867 --> 01:33:05.973
Yeah.

01:33:07.075 --> 01:33:08.869
Thanks.

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.663
Something's happening to me.

01:33:18.864 --> 01:33:20.869
What's wrong?

01:33:21.828 --> 01:33:23.732
You must know.

01:33:23.975 --> 01:33:26.367
You're a boy.

01:33:30.495 --> 01:33:32.500
I'm sorry, Kazuo.

01:33:32.894 --> 01:33:36.101
I may not be able to control myself.

01:33:37.302 --> 01:33:39.308
You may be right...

01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:42.397
Hey...

01:33:44.455 --> 01:33:46.250
Can I?

01:33:50.731 --> 01:33:52.635
No, we can't!

01:33:52.742 --> 01:33:53.647
Kazuo...

01:33:54.012 --> 01:33:56.643
This is your body, after all.

01:33:56.743 --> 01:33:59.349
And I'm in your body.

01:33:59.449 --> 01:34:02.055
We can't do it like this.

01:34:02.155 --> 01:34:03.559
But...

01:34:03.759 --> 01:34:05.763
Let's forget about it, OK?

01:34:06.764 --> 01:34:10.570
I don't know about complicated things like Hiroshi,

01:34:10.672 --> 01:34:14.830
I want to be myself when...

01:34:15.211 --> 01:34:16.882
When we...

01:34:17.887 --> 01:34:21.794
And if I got pregnant...

01:34:21.795 --> 01:34:25.303
I won't last for that.

01:34:25.904 --> 01:34:27.608
You're right.

01:34:28.909 --> 01:34:31.616
Let's get better first.

01:34:32.617 --> 01:34:34.312
Yeah.

01:34:39.933 --> 01:34:46.342
I've never seen my own face from this close before.

01:34:50.306 --> 01:34:52.410
Then, show me.

01:34:53.168 --> 01:34:55.173
Let me see myself.

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:56.770
Huh?

01:35:00.384 --> 01:35:04.392
I'll never see my own body again.

01:35:06.287 --> 01:35:08.190
So, please.

01:35:08.579 --> 01:35:11.282
I want to take a last look at my own body.

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:16.697
Let me say farewell to my body.

01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:20.385
OK.

01:35:27.949 --> 01:35:29.944
It's beautiful.

01:35:33.243 --> 01:35:36.048
See, our heartbeats

01:35:36.049 --> 01:35:40.046
are in sync like a single metronome.

01:35:44.583 --> 01:35:46.578
You're right.

01:35:55.679 --> 01:35:58.585
Goodbye, me.

01:35:59.297 --> 01:36:02.203
Goodbye, me.

01:36:02.326 --> 01:36:04.331
Goodbye, me.

01:36:04.408 --> 01:36:07.415
Goodbye, me.

01:36:08.364 --> 01:36:10.068
Goodbye, me.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.424
Goodbye, me.

01:36:12.524 --> 01:36:15.230
Goodbye, me.

01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:18.136
Goodbye, me.

01:36:18.537 --> 01:36:21.533
I will die for you.

01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:36.777
I'm starving.

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.385
Do you have an appetite?

01:36:41.485 --> 01:36:45.482
Yeah, it seems like my body is in a good condition today.

01:36:46.595 --> 01:36:48.690
I'll find something to eat.

01:37:05.434 --> 01:37:07.439
Yes, they seem like junior high students.

01:37:07.539 --> 01:37:10.345
Our boss is a nice man, so he can't help it.

01:37:10.445 --> 01:37:13.450
But they'll just get us into trouble.

01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:17.548
Let's get rid of them before that happens.

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.295
We're fine now.

01:38:03.957 --> 01:38:05.861
- Hey...
- What is it?

01:38:06.562 --> 01:38:08.467
Let's go home.

01:38:09.566 --> 01:38:10.913
Yeah.

01:38:11.072 --> 01:38:15.080
Our moms must be worried.

01:38:16.081 --> 01:38:17.584
More importantly,

01:38:17.585 --> 01:38:19.889
You'll get really sick at this rate.

01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:21.393
I guess.

01:38:21.935 --> 01:38:23.940
But before that...

01:38:24.199 --> 01:38:26.003
What?

01:38:26.103 --> 01:38:28.808
I want to see the Spring of Sabishira.

01:38:29.108 --> 01:38:31.003
The Spring of Sabishira?

01:38:33.418 --> 01:38:35.421
My dream was to

01:38:35.422 --> 01:38:38.830
turn my story into a song, and sing it.

01:38:39.130 --> 01:38:42.636
But I don't have musical talent like you.

01:38:42.838 --> 01:38:45.243
You're already singing your song.

01:38:45.343 --> 01:38:47.338
At least, that's what I think.

01:38:54.763 --> 01:38:56.658
Is this where you wanted to get off?

01:39:13.801 --> 01:39:15.506
Thank you very much.

01:39:16.107 --> 01:39:17.802
Thank you.

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:27.421
See ya.

01:39:27.529 --> 01:39:29.124
Take care.

01:39:36.158 --> 01:39:37.562
I'm sorry.

01:39:37.659 --> 01:39:39.064
I'll walk.

01:39:39.255 --> 01:39:41.159
You sure?

01:39:41.259 --> 01:39:44.466
Yeah, 
I told you I'm in a good condition today.

01:39:45.868 --> 01:39:47.262
OK.

01:39:50.712 --> 01:39:51.716
See?

01:39:53.898 --> 01:39:55.090
Watch out!

01:39:55.685 --> 01:39:56.827
I'm fine.

01:39:57.146 --> 01:39:59.097
I can walk with your support.

01:39:59.698 --> 01:40:00.701
OK.

01:40:01.001 --> 01:40:02.905
Let's climb together then.

01:40:03.004 --> 01:40:06.511
But... which gate will we enter from?

01:40:06.812 --> 01:40:10.415
Male's Gate and Female's Gate...

01:40:10.416 --> 01:40:12.721
makes no difference to us now.

01:40:13.026 --> 01:40:14.620
We've arrived.

01:40:18.436 --> 01:40:20.442
Are you alright, Kazuo?

01:40:21.042 --> 01:40:22.747
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:40:22.844 --> 01:40:24.349
I'm feeling good today.

01:40:24.549 --> 01:40:25.852
Kazuo.

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.456
What is it?

01:40:27.556 --> 01:40:29.961
When you die, I'll die too.

01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:31.166
Huh?

01:40:31.262 --> 01:40:34.068
I'll take my own life if you die!

01:40:34.069 --> 01:40:35.370
Don't be stupid!

01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:36.975
Why do you have to die?

01:40:37.076 --> 01:40:39.982
Because... because I...

01:40:40.082 --> 01:40:42.085
You have to live.

01:40:42.086 --> 01:40:44.223
You have to live in my place.

01:40:44.224 --> 01:40:46.193
Kazumi,

01:40:46.194 --> 01:40:48.097
I'm starting to understand.

01:40:48.098 --> 01:40:50.102
Hiroshi's words,

01:40:50.103 --> 01:40:56.613
were supposed to be "I'll <i>live</i> just for you".

01:40:57.116 --> 01:41:02.124
And I might just get cured, once I drink from the Spring of Sabishira.

01:41:02.128 --> 01:41:04.131
Right, yes!

01:41:04.132 --> 01:41:06.436
I'm sure you'll be cured.

01:41:06.536 --> 01:41:08.640
Let's drink together.

01:41:08.641 --> 01:41:11.236
From the Spring of Sabishira.

01:42:17.183 --> 01:42:20.491
Hey, don't say you'll die!

01:42:20.914 --> 01:42:23.910
You have to live, Kazumi!

01:42:26.302 --> 01:42:28.007
Ah...

01:42:29.208 --> 01:42:31.214
It's Kazuo.

01:42:31.314 --> 01:42:34.821
Of course! I'm Kazuo, and you're...

01:42:36.323 --> 01:42:40.120
Oh crap, our clothes switched again.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.035
Kazumi...

01:42:52.858 --> 01:42:56.265
Hey, slap me. Am I dreaming?

01:42:56.365 --> 01:42:59.271
Get ahold of yourself!

01:42:59.371 --> 01:43:01.375
It hurts, it hurts!

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:02.379
Kazumi.

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.480
We've switched back!

01:43:04.481 --> 01:43:06.787
Back to our own bodies!
- Kazumi...

01:43:07.187 --> 01:43:09.192
I love you.

01:43:09.292 --> 01:43:11.296
I really love you, Kazuo.

01:43:11.396 --> 01:43:14.893
I love you more than anyone else.

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:20.414
For you, Kazuo,

01:43:20.415 --> 01:43:22.419
I don't mind dying.

01:43:22.719 --> 01:43:25.226
I don't mind.

01:43:26.427 --> 01:43:29.434
I can die for you.

01:43:31.236 --> 01:43:33.231
Wait...

01:43:42.761 --> 01:43:44.766
Aren't you cold?

01:43:45.367 --> 01:43:47.371
I'm fine.

01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:50.476
Let me stay here for a while longer.

01:43:50.477 --> 01:43:52.481
Two of us together.

01:43:52.581 --> 01:43:54.484
I'm sorry.

01:43:54.485 --> 01:43:57.491
We shouldn't have come to the Spring of Sabishira.

01:43:57.492 --> 01:44:00.398
I was going to die for you.

01:44:00.498 --> 01:44:02.502
No, I wanted to live for you.

01:44:02.602 --> 01:44:04.506
Hey, Kazuo.

01:44:04.907 --> 01:44:06.411
What?

01:44:07.512 --> 01:44:10.518
It turned out for the best.

01:44:10.519 --> 01:44:13.326
This is natural.

01:44:14.158 --> 01:44:16.362
I will die as myself.

01:44:16.831 --> 01:44:20.228
That's why you have to live as yourself.

01:44:20.636 --> 01:44:21.870
OK?

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:27.553
Please,

01:44:27.554 --> 01:44:29.159
promise me.

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.065
OK.

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.572
It's alright.

01:44:36.573 --> 01:44:39.969
I'm filled with hope right now.

01:44:43.587 --> 01:44:45.490
You see,

01:44:45.491 --> 01:44:48.197
My body remembers.

01:44:48.498 --> 01:44:52.106
The fingers you played piano with.

01:44:53.006 --> 01:44:56.514
We didn't just switch.

01:44:56.614 --> 01:44:59.622
We're already two as one.

01:45:00.623 --> 01:45:02.228
Kazuo.

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:08.337
Hey, sing that song for me.

01:45:10.643 --> 01:45:12.647
That song,

01:45:12.648 --> 01:45:14.652
it was your song.

01:45:14.952 --> 01:45:18.849
I mean, I don't know how to sing.

01:45:19.662 --> 01:45:23.470
And I can't just come up with a song like that.

01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:27.577
That song can't even be sung without your voice.

01:45:29.483 --> 01:45:31.278
You're right.

01:45:31.485 --> 01:45:33.780
Then let's sing.

01:45:34.244 --> 01:45:37.250
Two songs as one.

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.203
Yeah.

01:45:39.604 --> 01:45:42.700
Two stories as one.

01:45:52.063 --> 01:45:57.569
<i>You will become a wind</i>

01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:04.076
<i>Become an invisible wind</i>

01:46:05.378 --> 01:46:11.885
<i>To your most most sought after place,</i>

01:46:12.385 --> 01:46:18.892
<i>You will become a wind and reach</i>

01:46:20.594 --> 01:46:27.101
<i>Don't laugh and say I'm strange</i>

01:46:27.601 --> 01:46:33.608
<i>It's slightly embarrassing</i>

01:46:34.885 --> 01:46:42.885
<i>You can see through everything</i>

01:46:46.326 --> 01:46:56.485
<i>That's why I'm leaving you now</i>

01:47:02.276 --> 01:47:04.271
- Here you go, dad.
- Thanks.

01:47:11.135 --> 01:47:13.339
Honey, dad.

01:47:13.598 --> 01:47:15.203
Kazuo brought flowers.

01:47:15.403 --> 01:47:16.607
Oh, he's here?

01:47:16.704 --> 01:47:18.609
Did you come for soba, Kazuo?

01:47:18.707 --> 01:47:19.410
Yes.

01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:20.514
Good.

01:47:20.614 --> 01:47:22.618
I'll make great soba for you.

01:47:22.918 --> 01:47:26.915
Kazumi was good at making soba.

01:47:27.929 --> 01:47:31.837
She was a far better craftsman than her dad.

01:47:31.937 --> 01:47:32.939
Did you know,

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.046
buckwheat grows in sterile land too harsh for other crops.

01:47:37.047 --> 01:47:39.952
People who lived in such lands

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:43.961
made noodles from low quality flour,

01:47:43.962 --> 01:47:45.967
and ate them to survive.

01:47:46.067 --> 01:47:50.075
That's why, soba is in no way a tasty food.

01:47:50.776 --> 01:47:56.085
But it's our job to figure out how to make it delicious.

01:47:56.182 --> 01:47:57.186
I see.

01:47:58.517 --> 01:48:00.121
That Kazumi,

01:48:00.578 --> 01:48:02.761
she made soba in a strange way a while back.

01:48:02.762 --> 01:48:03.966
Right?

01:48:04.505 --> 01:48:05.443
Yes, she did.

01:48:05.506 --> 01:48:07.845
- Shall we try it?
- No way!

01:48:07.846 --> 01:48:09.616
It's Kazumi's way.

01:48:09.617 --> 01:48:11.515
And it's for Kazuo.

01:48:11.516 --> 01:48:13.111
Let's do it.

01:48:27.954 --> 01:48:29.157
OK...

01:48:29.658 --> 01:48:31.963
Can you let me do it?

01:48:32.163 --> 01:48:34.568
Really? You want to try it?
- Yes.

01:48:34.768 --> 01:48:36.763
OK. You try it.

01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:57.617
That's a nice masculine sight.

01:48:58.618 --> 01:49:00.221
Darn it!

01:49:00.922 --> 01:49:04.319
It feels like Kazumi is back!

01:49:21.766 --> 01:49:23.469
These are your change of clothes.

01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:25.474
Wear a fresh pair of underwear everyday!

01:49:25.574 --> 01:49:28.179
I know! I'm not a kid anymore.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:30.183
I won't wet my bed either.

01:49:30.184 --> 01:49:32.387
Did you pack your new cell phone?

01:49:32.388 --> 01:49:34.492
Call me right away when you get there.

01:49:34.693 --> 01:49:36.698
Don't let it soak in water again!

01:49:36.798 --> 01:49:38.299
Fine, fine!

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:39.804
You're so annoying.

01:49:39.904 --> 01:49:45.012
Your speech became so rude immediately after Kazumi passed away.

01:49:45.115 --> 01:49:47.019
It just returned to normal.

01:49:47.119 --> 01:49:49.122
True, now that you mention it.

01:49:49.123 --> 01:49:52.230
But why Onomichi, of all places?

01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:54.834
Because there's no sea in Nagano.

01:49:54.934 --> 01:49:56.638
Sea?

01:49:56.738 --> 01:50:00.344
When I grow up a bit more, I want to cross the sea,

01:50:00.346 --> 01:50:03.353
and journey through foreign countries.

01:50:03.953 --> 01:50:06.958
There are many different stories of the sea.

01:50:06.959 --> 01:50:10.256
I want to visit them all.

01:50:12.171 --> 01:50:14.777
Will that make you lonely, mom?

01:50:15.978 --> 01:50:17.773
I won't be lonely.

01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:22.378
You've finally found what you want to do with your life.

01:50:22.591 --> 01:50:24.595
It makes me very happy.

01:50:25.999 --> 01:50:28.002
But...

01:50:28.003 --> 01:50:30.509
you're obviously staying in his place, right?

01:50:30.609 --> 01:50:31.814
You know, mom.

01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:34.816
You may be estranged from him,

01:50:34.817 --> 01:50:37.423
but he's still a father to me.

01:50:37.724 --> 01:50:40.328
Just as you will always be my mom.

01:50:40.329 --> 01:50:42.834
He will always be my dad.

01:50:42.934 --> 01:50:45.540
You're right, but still...

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:48.747
Oh well, at least you can play piano again.

01:50:48.948 --> 01:50:50.950
I've already said goodbye to piano.

01:50:50.951 --> 01:50:53.756
Anyway, they say blood is thicker than water.

01:50:53.757 --> 01:50:56.962
I mean, I'm only here because you two did it!

01:50:57.062 --> 01:50:57.964
Kazuo!

01:50:57.965 --> 01:51:01.462
How can say something like that to your own parent?!

01:51:02.676 --> 01:51:06.683
Mom, want to go to Onomichi with me?

01:51:08.988 --> 01:51:13.897
Actually, I'm thinking of running this bar.

01:51:13.999 --> 01:51:16.204
I'm still young!

01:51:16.311 --> 01:51:17.815
Plus, I'm a beauty, right?

01:51:17.816 --> 01:51:19.260
You're not supposed to say it yourself.

01:51:19.261 --> 01:51:22.501
But without a doubt, you're a beauty.

01:51:23.017 --> 01:51:25.713
Maybe you'll even fall in love with someone.

01:51:27.327 --> 01:51:29.322
A good luck charm.

01:51:32.037 --> 01:51:34.040
Do you want me to walk you to the station?

01:51:34.041 --> 01:51:36.045
No, I'll go by myself.

01:51:36.146 --> 01:51:37.140
Oh.

01:51:43.394 --> 01:51:46.101
Ah, it's snowing.

01:51:48.003 --> 01:51:50.008
Well then, have a safe trip.

01:51:50.108 --> 01:51:52.013
Study hard.

01:51:52.113 --> 01:51:53.118
OK.

01:51:56.121 --> 01:51:59.729
<i>It snowed a little that morning.</i>

01:51:59.825 --> 01:52:04.434
<i>It was like "once upon a time" in a fairy tale.</i>

01:52:04.839 --> 01:52:07.845
<i>Snow is fitting for farewells.</i>

01:52:08.045 --> 01:52:10.552
<i>Happy end...</i>

01:52:10.848 --> 01:52:13.851
<i>Or will it be one?</i>

01:52:13.951 --> 01:52:14.952
Hello, Akemi?

01:52:15.053 --> 01:52:18.056
I just left home.

01:52:18.132 --> 01:52:21.137
I'm just going to take a detour before heading for the station.

01:52:21.138 --> 01:52:23.744
I think I will arrive on time.

01:52:23.844 --> 01:52:25.849
So, how did it go between you and Hiroshi?

01:52:26.250 --> 01:52:29.256
About that... Hiroshi is acting strangely.

01:52:30.057 --> 01:52:32.062
He just emailed me a while ago,

01:52:32.162 --> 01:52:37.169
"Your forehead is cute, I like the shape of your jaw."

01:52:38.073 --> 01:52:41.081
As if he doesn't care about what's inside.

01:52:41.181 --> 01:52:43.787
Are we really talking about that Mr. Kierkegaard?

01:52:43.884 --> 01:52:46.790
Anyway, I can't wait to eat your udon.

01:52:47.092 --> 01:52:49.096
Please make a good bowl for me.
