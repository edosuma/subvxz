WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:05.806
(clears throat)

00:05.839 --> 00:07.108
To Debbie and Adam

00:07.141 --> 00:09.077
on the last night
of their business,

00:09.110 --> 00:10.544
a toast.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.013
The only thing on their menu
you could actually eat.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.550
Well, thanks, guys.
You know, when I first

00:16.584 --> 00:18.586
had the idea for The
Whispering Frog Yoga Cafe,

00:18.619 --> 00:21.289
a lot of people had jokes
about how it would croak.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.523
(laughs)

00:22.556 --> 00:24.325
Well, it did.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.194
But it taught us a lot
that's gonna make

00:26.227 --> 00:27.561
our next project
a sure success.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.496
Yeah, isn't it great?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.831
Adam already came up
with another great idea.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.100
Yeah, I'm not sure
the word "another"

00:32.133 --> 00:33.734
means what you think it means.

00:33.767 --> 00:37.271
Sure, it was a great idea to
open a restaurant ten years ago.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.840
But now nobody cool eats
at restaurants anymore.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.809
So, I present to you

00:41.842 --> 00:44.245
The Whispering Frog
Yoga Cafe food truck!

00:44.278 --> 00:47.481
Ooh!

00:47.515 --> 00:49.783
I know what you're thinking--
what a no-brainer.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.253
That is what I was thinking.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.321
Oh, Debbie, you forgot the best

00:53.354 --> 00:54.788
part of the presentation--
the promotional tool.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.125
Oh, yeah.
Oh, good. There's more.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.328
Hey, guys, this restaurant
on wheels is a terrible idea.

01:00.361 --> 01:01.795
Uh, the only good thing
about this place was

01:01.829 --> 01:03.497
that it stayed put
so we could avoid it.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.799
I can't believe Debbie
is supporting this.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.269
I mean, how did she get so dumb?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.173
Well, don't blame me.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.307
I might've dropped
her on her head

01:13.341 --> 01:14.475
a couple of times
when she was a baby.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.509
But you're the one
who let her chew

01:15.543 --> 01:17.278
the paint off the windowsill.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.413
Listen, you guys,
what we have to do...
I did not!

01:19.447 --> 01:20.781
Hey, hey, guys. Do you
really need to butt in?

01:20.814 --> 01:21.849
So, they mistake
another mistake?

01:21.882 --> 01:22.883
Who's it hurting?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.552
T-shirt gun time!

01:24.585 --> 01:27.188
(grunts)

01:28.356 --> 01:30.224
(coughs)

01:55.816 --> 01:58.552
So, two margaritas
and an order of potato skins.

01:58.586 --> 02:02.590
Half loaded, half no cheese,
no sour cream, no potato.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.625
Yeah, that's right.
Just the skins. Yeah, yeah.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.660
I'm just, I'm trying to get back
in my skinny, skinny jeans.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.629
(laughs)

02:08.662 --> 02:11.432
Oh, and if you could steam
those, that'd be great. Thanks.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.566
Wow! She is cute!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.635
Yes, she is.
And when she comes back,

02:14.668 --> 02:16.537
I need you to talk me up
a little bit.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.339
Why can't you be
my wing man for once?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.174
Whoa! What do you mean
"for once"?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.575
Come on, man.
I'm always your wing man.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.910
Never the other way around.

02:22.943 --> 02:26.380
It's been that way
since the day we met!

02:26.414 --> 02:27.915
Nice weather report
this morning, Kim.

02:27.948 --> 02:28.949
This is Nate.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.219
I see an 80% chance
of you two in the shower!

02:31.252 --> 02:33.921
Whoo!

02:33.954 --> 02:35.423
Hey, you got a mobile telephone?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.258
My buddy's got
a mobile telephone.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.627
Please leave your name
and number after the "woo."

02:39.660 --> 02:41.829
Whoo!

02:41.862 --> 02:43.297
Excuse me?

02:43.331 --> 02:44.865
My friend has something
he needs to tell you.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.268
And what he need
to tell you is...

02:47.301 --> 02:48.836
Whazzup?!

02:48.869 --> 02:50.671
(laughs)

02:50.704 --> 02:51.905
I love that commercial.

02:51.939 --> 02:52.940
Let's have sex!

02:52.973 --> 02:54.708
Whoo!

02:54.742 --> 02:55.609
Wait, hold on.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.711
I have been your wing man
plenty of times.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.413
Oh, really? Name one.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.681
All right.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.683
Uh, there was that time...

03:02.716 --> 03:03.884
Okay, no, that was you. Um...

03:03.917 --> 03:05.753
Oh, I know! Last year.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.755
No! God! Think, Nathan, think!

03:07.788 --> 03:09.590
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:09.623 --> 03:11.459
Okay, fine.
I can't think of a time.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.893
Look, it's no big deal.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.795
Just not the wing man type.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.298
You're a little
too self-involved.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.599
Hey! That is crazy, man!

03:18.632 --> 03:20.568
I make a great wing man.
(laughs)

03:20.601 --> 03:21.569
Look, here she comes.
All right, you know what?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.504
Sit back and enjoy
the in-flight entertainment--

03:23.537 --> 03:26.340
a very special episode
of Ray's Anatomy.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.642
Okay, here's your drinks.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.679
The steamed potato skins
might be a while.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.648
The guys in the kitchen
are still laughing.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.650
Great. Um, hey, listen, have
you met my best friend, Ray?

03:36.684 --> 03:38.652
He will not
tell you himself,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.921
but he is the best cameraman
in the biz.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.823
Really? What does he film?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.792
Well, me, mostly. It's...

03:44.825 --> 03:47.961
I'm a, I'm a news
reporter for WXDN.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.763
I knew you looked familiar.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.998
Nathan Miller.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.800
You are so much cuter in person.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.336
Wow. Well, thank you.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.538
Maybe I ought
to fire my makeup girl.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.506
(both laugh)

03:58.539 --> 04:00.674
Ray, Ray, Ray,
where-where you going, man?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.710
You tried, man.
It's just not you, buddy.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.677
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.012
Oh, come on! I was gonna...

04:05.045 --> 04:06.780
I was gonna circle
back around to you!

04:06.814 --> 04:08.048
Come on, I was gonna
tell her that you got

04:08.081 --> 04:10.384
the longest zoom
in the business!

04:14.087 --> 04:16.290
(door closes)

04:21.429 --> 04:22.663
Rough day at school?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.798
That girl Kaitlyn
keeps bothering me.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.000
She told everyone
my middle name is David.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.837
How did she even find out?

04:29.870 --> 04:31.839
You know, when I was
growing up, I experienced

04:31.872 --> 04:33.741
both sides of bullying.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.443
Getting bullied...

04:35.476 --> 04:37.645
and tattling on bullies.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.548
It was only later that I
found out how to get revenge.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.915
Okay? So, here's
what you have to do.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.685
Find out everything that
she is deathly afraid of.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.887
Okay, and then we can
play a prank on her.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.590
Unless, of course,
you think that's too mean.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.825
Daddy, I ride the bus
to public school.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.595
If it wasn't David,
"Mean" would be my middle name.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.432
Okay, so, this is the truck

04:58.466 --> 05:00.434
we're thinking of buying.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.470
It was a bloodmobile,
so it needs some work.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.673
But if we buy it, they say
they'll give us a cookie.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.940
You know what, honey?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.677
I just don't know
if this is the best idea.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.644
(laughs)
Okay, obviously,

05:10.678 --> 05:13.814
we'll get the truck
tested for hepatitis.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.015
No, not this truck.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.584
Any truck.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.519
You were sweet to support
Adam for so long.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.422
But you can't keep
encouraging his bad ideas.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.391
Hey, how do you know
what's a bad idea?

05:23.424 --> 05:25.325
Because the food is awful!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.962
Your restaurant is
the only place I've ever seen

05:28.996 --> 05:31.699
raccoons putting
a lid on a trash can.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.804
Oh, my God.
You're right.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.673
Oh, Adam just gets so
excited when he talks

05:39.707 --> 05:41.875
about this stuff and
then I get swept up, too.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.711
I don't know why.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.446
You're blinded by love.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.780
Early in our marriage,

05:46.814 --> 05:49.483
I let Tom talk me
into some stupid ideas.

05:49.517 --> 05:52.019
Like marriage itself.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.888
You can't keep following Adam
down these terrible paths.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.891
Let me, let me
help you find a real job.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.092
I don't know. I mean,
what would Adam do?

05:59.126 --> 06:00.594
We've always been partners.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.396
Well, maybe when he sees
you've given up on the idea,

06:02.430 --> 06:04.097
he'll realize it's awful, too.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.667
Oh, come on, it wasn't
the worst idea in the world.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.169
And no matter what you say,
our food wasn't that bad.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.439
Hey, Deb. Uh, you know
all that old food

06:11.472 --> 06:12.840
from the restaurant
we tossed out back?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.775
I think the raccoons
might've gotten to it,

06:14.808 --> 06:17.678
because I just found it all
in a neat pile on the doorstep.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.553
Oh, wow, they're hiring
singers down at The Colada!

06:25.586 --> 06:27.020
I tried lounge singing
for a while.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.791
But this voice
really belongs in an arena.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.027
Oh, here's
a good one for Debbie.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.195
You think she'd
be interested in

06:35.228 --> 06:38.566
"the exciting world
of boatyard security"?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.633
Nothing near the coast.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.868
She had scoliosis,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.136
and the saltwater
could rust her spine.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.772
Oh, what about this?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.441
"Assistant Manager needed
for car rental location.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.711
Possibility for advancement."

06:50.744 --> 06:52.780
She could go
from car rentals here

06:52.813 --> 06:54.882
to car rentals downtown...

06:54.915 --> 06:57.150
to car rentals
across the river...

06:57.184 --> 06:59.152
My God, she could end up

06:59.186 --> 07:01.655
working at the airport!

07:03.657 --> 07:04.892
Oh, hi, Nathan.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.860
Kip and I were just
borrowing your paper.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.962
We might've just
found a job for...

07:08.996 --> 07:10.498
That's great or terrible
or whatever.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.032
Hey, listen, um,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.667
am I only interested in myself?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.769
I'm worried that I'm
becoming a narcissist.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.905
Well, that's ridiculous!

07:17.938 --> 07:20.107
How could a boy as smart
and handsome as you,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.676
with the perfect amount
of leg hair for a man

07:22.710 --> 07:24.912
ever become a narcissist?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.583
Yeah, I wonder.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.952
I'd better go tell
Debbie about this job.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.221
Oh, I hope they don't drug test.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.924
I ate a lot of poppy seed bagels
when I was pregnant with her,

07:36.957 --> 07:40.561
and I don't know how long
that stuff stays in your system.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.964
Plus, I think she smokes weed.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.066
(door closes)

07:55.275 --> 07:57.611
Hey, Kip. Uh...

07:57.645 --> 07:59.780
my-my mom went that way, so...

07:59.813 --> 08:02.115
You know, if you really want
to address this problem,

08:02.149 --> 08:03.784
I can help you.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.519
Well, thanks.
I'm not a narcissist.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.855
He said, about to take a sip
from his own face.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.726
I didn't, I, I didn't make this.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.827
It was a gift from Ray.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.629
Okay. Well, hey,
why don't we take a spin

08:15.663 --> 08:17.130
through your recent
Google searches, okay?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.131
No, I don't think it would...

08:18.165 --> 08:20.668
Wow! "Nathan Miller shirtless.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.770
"Nathan Miller gym.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.104
Nathan Miller abs..."

08:24.137 --> 08:25.739
Okay, yeah, but,
you know what?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.541
That's because I'd heard
that there was a picture

08:27.575 --> 08:28.776
going around of me
changing at the gym.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.779
"How do you make a shirtless
photo of a celebrity go viral?"

08:31.812 --> 08:33.781
Okay, you know what? Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

08:33.814 --> 08:37.585
Okay, fine. Yes, maybe there is
a little bit of narcissism.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.286
But I don't need help.
I can stop whenever I want.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.889
See? Look.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.823
Stopped.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.793
You can't just stop
being a narcissist.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.294
It doesn't work that way.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.864
Oh, my God, you're gazing
at your reflection

08:50.898 --> 08:52.199
in my spoon.
Oh... (scoffs)

08:52.232 --> 08:54.201
Okay, now you're
just being...

08:54.234 --> 08:55.869
complete...

09:01.709 --> 09:04.144
(laughing)

09:04.177 --> 09:06.179
I need help.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.987
Oh, my God, I'm shaking.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.756
I don't know if I'm nervous
about this job interview

09:15.789 --> 09:16.957
or if I'm just
uncomfortable wearing

09:16.990 --> 09:19.927
the same suit Aunt Beth died in.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.696
Interviews are a breeze.
Here's what you do:

09:22.730 --> 09:25.232
Get on your computer and go
to something called Bing.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.702
Then type in "Yahoo.com."

09:28.736 --> 09:32.072
From there type in "Google."

09:32.105 --> 09:35.042
Click on that, then type the
interviewer's name in the box,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.077
and learn everything
you can about him.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.246
That way you can pretend
you have the same interests.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.216
Wow, that was
some great work, sweetie.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.019
Uh, it looks like Kaitlyn
is afraid of heights,

09:46.053 --> 09:49.957
spiders and a nuclear Iran.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.761
Okay, now I have to warn you

09:53.794 --> 09:55.863
this next phase is not
gonna be easy, okay?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.364
You have to build
up her trust.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.800
And then pretend
to be her friend.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.669
Got it.
The classic double-cross.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.705
Just like they're gonna do
next year on The Kardashians

10:04.738 --> 10:08.642
when they finally tell that big
one she's not their real sister.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.280
(clears throat)
Adam, we need to talk.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.684
Okay, look...

10:16.717 --> 10:19.319
I love being partners
with you, okay?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.955
But, so far, all of our
businesses have failed,

10:21.989 --> 10:24.958
and we need to provide
for Mikayla,

10:24.992 --> 10:26.960
so, my mom had
a talk with me--

10:26.994 --> 10:28.128
well, at me--

10:28.161 --> 10:29.797
Mm...
And...

10:29.830 --> 10:31.799
I've decided to try
and get a full-time job

10:31.832 --> 10:33.333
at a car rental place.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.335
Wait, what? I-I didn't...

10:35.368 --> 10:37.404
You made this decision
without consulting with me.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.806
I thought we were partners.

10:38.839 --> 10:39.907
No, I know. I'm sorry.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.943
But I think this is
the best thing for our family.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.277
Fine.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.346
Fine, I guess that's just
the way it is.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.015
Oh, and not that you care,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.984
but our food truck passed
its hepatitis test.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.257
To overcome your narcissism,

10:57.290 --> 10:58.992
you need to look
in this mirror,

10:59.026 --> 11:00.861
and see who
you really are, okay?

11:03.831 --> 11:05.766
Look, that's not a...
That's not a...

11:05.799 --> 11:07.400
BOTH:
What are you do...

11:07.434 --> 11:09.937
Will you stop it?
No questions.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.340
Hi, Nathan.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.042
It's me, Nathan.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.745
I got it all: a cool job,

11:17.778 --> 11:18.846
a doting mother

11:18.879 --> 11:20.914
and a surprisingly easy
voice to mimic.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.784
But underneath my thick coating

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
of pomegranate body spray,

11:25.986 --> 11:27.921
is a nervous little boy,

11:27.955 --> 11:30.023
terrified that
he'll never be loved.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.761
Maybe that's why I wet my bed
until I was ten.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.029
Wait a second, did my
mom tell you that?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.865
We were playing truth or dare,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.132
and it was either tell me that

11:39.166 --> 11:41.301
or get the mail
without pants on.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.408
What would you say
is your greatest strength?

11:48.441 --> 11:51.812
I feel like it's
probably my patience,

11:51.845 --> 11:54.447
which is something I got from
my summers spent fly fishing

11:54.481 --> 11:55.783
on the Snake River.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.451
Okay. That's the ninth time

11:58.485 --> 12:00.053
you've mention fly fishing
during this interview.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.455
Did you Google me?

12:02.489 --> 12:03.791
Google you?

12:03.824 --> 12:04.858
I don't even know
what Google is.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.193
Is that a car rental
industry term?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.896
Did you park
the Google out back?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.297
If you don't know
what Google is,

12:10.330 --> 12:12.332
we can end this meeting
right now.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.867
(chuckles) No, no,
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.803
Of course I know what Google is.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.972
It's, uh, it's like
when you cast a word out

12:19.006 --> 12:20.841
into the Internet,

12:20.874 --> 12:22.843
and then you reel
the information back in.

12:22.876 --> 12:23.911
Yeah, I don't fish.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.245
However,

12:25.278 --> 12:27.280
there is a Robert Phillips
who lives in Wyoming

12:27.314 --> 12:30.483
who posts all kind of crap
about fly fishing.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.952
Hello.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.087
I'm here today to
express interest

12:34.121 --> 12:35.488
in your job offering today.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.924
I'm in the middle
of an interview.

12:36.957 --> 12:37.991
I will be right with you.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.827
No, you'll be with me right now.

12:39.860 --> 12:40.828
Initiative.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.095
Little bit about myself,

12:42.129 --> 12:44.064
I believe my greatest strength
is my loyalty.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.334
When I commit to something,
like, say, a partnership,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.269
I stick to that commitment.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.472
It's like a trout caught
on a well-cast line

12:52.505 --> 12:54.574
when you're knee-deep
in the Snake River.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.243
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.912
Oh, sir, sir...
(chuckles nervously)

12:58.946 --> 13:01.148
I admire your eagerness
to provide for your family,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.316
but there's no need to
interrupt our meeting.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.185
Because you're ruining your
and other people's chances

13:05.218 --> 13:06.854
of getting the job.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.121
So if you don't mind
to wait outside,

13:08.155 --> 13:09.089
somebody will be
with you shortly, okay?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.291
No, see... I just...
Okay, thank you very much.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
Wow.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.397
You know, half this job
is handling crazy people

13:17.430 --> 13:18.832
without yelling at them.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.367
You're hired.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.534
Oh!

13:21.568 --> 13:23.603
Oh, my God. Wow, um...

13:23.636 --> 13:24.604
Thank you.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.874
Well, as long
as you can explain

13:26.907 --> 13:28.108
these multiple
shoplifting convictions.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.877
Uh, oh, oh, my God.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.913
You know what, you have also
Googled the wrong person.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.047
(chuckles)

13:34.081 --> 13:35.983
Damn that other
Debbie Stoker.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.885
Oh, she is such a kook.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.920
Although I hear
she's quite beautiful.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.193
And at night,
I lie awake worrying,

13:46.226 --> 13:48.528
"Is this as good as my life
is gonna get?

13:48.561 --> 13:51.564
"A divorced man living
across the hall from my mother.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.201
"Texting, 'What's up, Brian?'
to random New York numbers,

13:54.234 --> 13:56.036
hoping one day
I'll reach Brian Williams."

13:56.069 --> 13:57.604
Okay, stop.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.605
Stop, okay?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.307
Just, please, just stop.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.474
You're right.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.243
I'm not so great.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.445
In fact, the only reason
I talk about myself so much

14:05.478 --> 14:07.480
is because I'm worried
that no one else will.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.450
Nathan, we did it.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.185
You had a breakthrough.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.486
Okay, you broke me down,
but next you-you build me

14:13.520 --> 14:14.587
back up, right?

14:14.621 --> 14:15.455
Please hurry.
I hate this feeling.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.557
What do people call it,
vulnerability?

14:17.590 --> 14:20.260
Okay, before I build you up,
we need to do a sweep.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.964
Like an alcoholic
pouring booze down the drain.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.465
We need to rid this place
of your addiction.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.600
Where's that mug
with your mug on it?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.136
It's down there.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.605
Oh, my God.
You have two of these?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.942
In case a girl stays over.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.444
Is this all of it?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.912
Yes.

14:38.946 --> 14:39.980
Yes.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.515
Yes!

14:42.549 --> 14:44.051
Yes!

14:45.618 --> 14:47.520
No.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.526
Baseball caps?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.563
A clock?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.134
A towel with your face on it.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.070
When I'm drying my face
at the gym,

15:03.103 --> 15:06.573
I don't want to deny people the
chance of a celebrity sighting.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.578
Ray gave you all of this?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.580
Look, on my birthday,
he would take me out for dinner

15:13.613 --> 15:15.048
and just get me one of those.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.449
It just kind of became
our thing.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.617
And what did you do for him?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.519
I said thank you.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.955
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.656
All these years,
he's done so much for me

15:23.690 --> 15:25.558
and I've done almost nothing
in return.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.627
There's got to be some kind
of way that I can show him

15:27.660 --> 15:29.029
that I care about him

15:29.062 --> 15:30.530
just as much as
he cares about me.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.500
Well, it would have to be
some sort of grand gesture.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.567
Yeah.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.737
Maybe you could write him
a big, heartfelt song.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.708
Have it sung
by a gifted amateur singer.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.742
Oh, you know what, I know.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.278
I could make him something
with his face on it.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.580
Interesting,
or there's that big song idea

15:47.614 --> 15:49.082
you just mentioned.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.351
Wait a minute, I just realized,
I sing.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.319
Yes, yes, yes.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.688
I will make him
a "Ray of the Month" calendar.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
You know, like, a Januar-Ray.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.425
Februar-Ray.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.193
March-a-Ray.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.728
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.496
I think you can buy
those things online.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.533
* So hard to decide
between two ideas *

16:06.566 --> 16:09.102
* One is brilliant

16:09.136 --> 16:11.071
* And the other is Nathan's.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.672
Check it out. Here.

16:12.705 --> 16:13.840
It's perfect. Look at that.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.209
And we can put some pictures
of his family in it, too.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.545
We'll sneak into his apartment,
get some pictures.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.281
It's all right, I know
where he hides his spare key.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.016
* So many options

16:23.050 --> 16:25.385
* It's hard to decide

16:25.418 --> 16:27.387
* You can do it down low

16:27.420 --> 16:29.422
* Or maybe up high!

16:40.633 --> 16:43.170
This is so exciting.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.639
I do not get to walk
on my tiptoes enough.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.741
Ray's basketball game
breaks up at 9:00, okay?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.243
So we just need to hurry up.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.511
Okay, fine, uh, I'll look

16:51.544 --> 16:53.546
through this stuff here.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.615
Look, all the photographs
are right here, Kip.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.084
You do not need to snoop.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.352
Oh, my God.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.654
This is Bad.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.657
This is Dangerous.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.394
This is Off The Wall.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.731
He's got all Michael Jackson's
albums on cassette.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.537
Congrats on the job.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.339
How's Adam doing?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.607
Eh, not great.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.542
He was so upset
that he walked home

17:22.575 --> 17:24.644
and left our car
at the rental place.

17:24.677 --> 17:28.181
Now a Korean family from Toronto
has it until Thursday.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.586
(muffled): If a productive
member of the family

17:33.620 --> 17:36.756
needs the couch, just let me
know and I'll move to the floor.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.430
Adam, you are still an
important part of this family.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.232
Hey, when we hear
a noise downstairs

17:45.265 --> 17:48.135
in the middle of the night,
who's the one who barks?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.773
(laughter)

17:53.806 --> 17:56.676
I'll see you upstairs
in a second, Kaitlyn.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.813
Bad news, Dad.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.582
It turns out
Kaitlyn's pretty cool.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.883
Oh.
We both like apples

18:03.916 --> 18:06.419
and when we grow up, we both
want to be on The Bachelor.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.290
So can we call off the plan?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.624
Aw, man.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.126
We planned all that stuff out.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.695
But if that's
how you feel, okay.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.763
Thanks, Dad.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.700
Wait, was that Kaitlyn
she was playing with?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.135
I thought they were enemies.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.436
Well, they were.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.372
I told Mikayla
I had a secret plan

18:25.405 --> 18:26.739
to get rid of an enemy.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.508
Really, I just sent her
on all these little missions

18:28.541 --> 18:30.510
that were designed to make her
hang out with Kaitlyn more

18:30.543 --> 18:31.778
and get to know her better,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.280
hopefully become friends
with her, so...

18:33.313 --> 18:35.648
Guess my secret plan worked.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.417
I was so busy
with this job stuff

18:37.450 --> 18:39.586
that I didn't even realize
this was still going on.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.321
Talk about feeling useless.
Yeah.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.291
I'm really glad Mikayla
had you to turn to.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.326
It's my job; I'm her dad.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.363
You know what?
With you working full-time,

18:50.397 --> 18:52.299
someone's gonna have
to take care of Mikayla.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.801
I guess things aren't
as uneven as I thought.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.336
I misjudged you, Adam.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.438
Tom never helped out
with the kids.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.274
The one time I asked him
to walk Debbie to the bus,

19:01.308 --> 19:04.477
I had to pick her up at the
Greyhound station in Atlanta.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.384
KIP:
Oh, my God.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.520
What a fun medicine cabinet.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.823
I beg you, stop snooping.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.824
I'm not snooping.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.559
I'm looking out for your friend.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.261
If I don't take
these pain pills,

19:21.294 --> 19:22.862
he might get addicted.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.399
What the hell
are you guys doing?

19:26.433 --> 19:27.500
Ray!

19:27.534 --> 19:28.968
Uh, I'll be in the car.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.670
You're driving.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.873
Look, man, I-I didn't
know you were home.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.743
I just...
What are you doing
with pictures of my mama?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.845
Look, I-I was trying to find
some pictures

19:38.878 --> 19:40.413
so I could make you a calendar.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.649
I wanted to show you
that I could be a better friend.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.517
I feel bad that you're
always making stuff for me,

19:44.551 --> 19:45.752
and I never do anything for you.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.254
(chuckles)
That's a sweet idea,

19:47.287 --> 19:48.154
if I were you.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.823
The only reason I make
those things for you

19:50.857 --> 19:52.925
is because I know how much
you love looking at yourself.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.727
(chuckles)
Why do you think I'm always

19:54.761 --> 19:56.429
wearing mirrored sunglasses?

19:56.463 --> 19:58.531
Right, you're right,
it was a dumb idea.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.700
I mean, not as dumb
as singing a song, but...

20:00.733 --> 20:04.271
KIP: * I still think a song
would work much better *

20:04.304 --> 20:07.774
* These pills are really
starting to kick in! *

20:08.775 --> 20:10.243
Why did you bring him with you?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.611
I thought you didn't like
that guy?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.580
Yeah, trust me, after spending
the whole day with him,

20:13.613 --> 20:14.714
trying to get over my
selfishness,

20:14.747 --> 20:15.582
I like him even less.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.883
So you spent the whole day

20:16.916 --> 20:18.451
with someone you don't like

20:18.485 --> 20:21.421
in order to learn how to be
a better friend to me?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.455
Well, yeah.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.523
(chuckles)
Wow.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.725
You're a lot less selfish
than I thought you were.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.226
Give it up.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.331
Look, man, from now on,
I promise I am gonna be

20:31.364 --> 20:33.633
a better wing man, okay?
I mean it, I mean it.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.034
(laughs)
I don't need a wing man.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.503
I know, but still, tonight...

20:36.536 --> 20:37.670
Ray?

20:38.771 --> 20:40.607
Hey, Potato Skins.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.743
You were right
about your friend.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.446
He does have the longest zoom
in the business.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.617
Like I said,
I don't need a wing man.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.585
I'll see you at work.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.587
Hit that strobe light!

20:54.621 --> 20:56.623
Things are about to get funky.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.594
I'm the one who told her
you were a great cameraman!

21:01.628 --> 21:04.397
I get credit for this!

21:06.566 --> 21:08.535
Oh, I am the best wing man ever.
(whoops)

21:08.568 --> 21:09.569
