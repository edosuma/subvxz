WEBVTT

00:39.520 --> 00:40.880
We can start tomorrow morning.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.720
We'll be open for business too.
Will that work?

00:44.320 --> 00:50.360
-Sure, we can start round the back.
-Then we have a deal. Perfect!

00:50.440 --> 00:53.520
-Are you coming home for Christmas?
<i>-I'm not sure.</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:56.480
<i>Fredrik wants to go to Cambodia.</i>

00:56.560 --> 00:58.440
Do you have enough for a ticket home?

00:58.960 --> 00:59.840
Kim?

00:59.920 --> 01:01.880
It's Ulrika. Have you heard from Kim?

01:01.960 --> 01:06.120
-I thought you two Skyped every day.
-I haven't heard from her. It's odd.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.400
For your hot tubs.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.400
Where did you get it?

01:15.600 --> 01:18.440
On your way out here,
did you see that it was on fire?

01:19.640 --> 01:20.600
Yes.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.400
-The insurance for the restaurant.
-It came through now?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.840
I liked it better
when it was just the two of us.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.240
Is it serious between you and Petra?

01:32.320 --> 01:34.040
I don't know what you're on about.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.320
I saw you.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.040
Liv?

01:50.960 --> 01:55.160
-Where have you been?
-I was hiking.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.160
-Climbed mountains.
-Whereabouts?

02:00.160 --> 02:02.360
-In Nepal.
-Really?

02:02.440 --> 02:06.640
Yes. I've travelled, hiked and...

02:07.680 --> 02:10.920
...hung out with
20-year-old backpackers.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.840
Only to realise I was just as lost
there as I am here.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.200
But with a prettier view.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.240
I came home for Oskar.
That's the only reason I'm here.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.200
-The delivery is here. I'll just...
-Okay.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.360
<i>You have one new message.</i>

02:38.440 --> 02:42.720
<i>Dad, you have to help me!</i>
<i>We got robbed and I can't reach Mum.</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:48.680
<i>Please, Dad, help me! I just want</i>
<i>to come home. Fredrik is gone and...</i>

03:30.000 --> 03:33.600
THICKER THAN WATER

03:55.880 --> 03:58.800
-What did she say?
-Ulrika has contacted the embassy.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.240
-The police are looking for the guy.
-Does nobody know where she is?

04:02.320 --> 04:04.360
-No.
-What are you going to do?

04:04.640 --> 04:08.280
We're meeting at the airport
to catch the first flight to Vietnam.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.600
Come here.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.640
It will be okay, Lasse. You have to
believe that she's all right.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.760
Sorry that I'll miss the opening.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.880
Don't worry about that.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.480
-Good luck. It'll be all right.
-Thanks.

04:23.040 --> 04:28.160
-It's good to have you back. Bye.
-See you.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.360
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes, but it's nice to be home.

04:33.440 --> 04:39.000
-Have you seen Oskar?
-No, I think he had errands to run.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.800
I have to go.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.520
Would you like a lift to church?

04:56.680 --> 04:59.840
-I don't work there anymore.
-Pardon?

05:00.560 --> 05:03.480
-I quit.
-What you do mean?

05:04.040 --> 05:08.760
It was time I did something
about it.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.320
Sorry..."it"?

05:10.400 --> 05:13.720
I can't be hoping for you to get
divorced and still marry people.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.880
You make it sound like just another
job. I thought it was a vocation.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.360
Do you think it was an easy decision
to make? Oskar, I'm almost forty.

05:22.440 --> 05:28.320
It's time for me to live my own life
instead of guiding others in theirs.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.560
I'm doing it for me.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.960
And for us.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.400
I know what I want.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.840
Speak soon?

06:22.120 --> 06:25.440
-What have you done?
-It's stuck.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
How are you?

06:47.880 --> 06:51.760
-Where have you been?
-Where have I been?

06:53.440 --> 06:56.280
I've been here, in the same place,
all my life.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.000
The question is
where the hell you have been.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.960
-Can I help you with that?
-No.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.240
-No.
-I'm back now.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.200
You left me.
Why were you gone for so long?

07:18.520 --> 07:22.320
-I'm sorry.
-How could you be gone for so long?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.320
-I'm sorry.
-Liv...

07:38.080 --> 07:41.640
-Nothing has changed around here.
-It's just the way you left it.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.080
A bit dustier, perhaps.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.080
I needed time to think.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.360
I want us to be together.

08:15.600 --> 08:21.120
<i>Dad, you have to help me!</i>
<i>We got robbed and I can't reach Mum.</i>

08:29.080 --> 08:31.240
Great, I'll see you at 2 pm.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.280
Great.
Thank you. Goodbye.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.200
-Damn it!
-Let me help you.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.280
Thanks. Grab those two.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.480
-They're heavy.
-Yes.

08:50.760 --> 08:55.360
I've got an idea
for how you can finish this quicker.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.840
-We have vacancies.
-What do you mean?

08:59.920 --> 09:04.120
-Do you want us to live here?
-Yes, to save time.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.560
You wouldn't have to
go back and forth.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.040
And breakfast is included.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.160
-It would save a lot of time.
-Great! It's settled.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.400
Maybe you can
knock some off the bill.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.120
-I'll put it here. See you later!
-See you.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.080
What happens next?
I mean, I've been thinking.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.920
-Should we buy out Lasse and Jonna?
-I don't think we can.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.800
What if they want to sell their
shares? It's possible, even probable.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.400
-Things have changed around here.
-Morning meeting.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.000
We might as well inform you
about the new arrangements.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.520
-Arrangements?
-I'll let Jonna explain.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.480
The renovations will
go on a for bit longer,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.800
but they won't
interfere with business.

10:08.880 --> 10:13.280
It would be good if they could keep
their things out back.

10:13.360 --> 10:17.880
Noted. We're having Christmas
dinners starting tonight.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.800
There will be ice fishing
and hot tubs.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.160
-I need to speak with Konrad too.
-Hot tubs?

10:25.760 --> 10:32.040
-Don't expect much from Konrad.
-I have also drawn up a schedule.

10:32.120 --> 10:37.560
Lasse is head of the kitchen,
but he will have a stand in for now.

10:37.640 --> 10:42.800
I will host and serve, and Oskar
will handle guest activities.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.480
-What about me?
-You will help me.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.360
Right...

10:49.280 --> 10:52.360
I see you haven't ordered the food
from Wallmans.

10:52.440 --> 10:57.240
No, these guys could deliver quicker.
It was cheaper than last year, too.

10:58.080 --> 11:03.280
Well, the thing is
we get a 15% discount at Wallmans.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.560
Do you know how much we've lost
before the first Christmas dinner?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.760
Why didn't you do it
like we always do?

11:10.840 --> 11:15.840
Because nothing was done here
when we arrived. We had to improvise.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.800
It doesn't matter.
Everything has been delivered.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.040
Doesn't matter?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.960
We have business relations with our
suppliers all year round.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.120
This is how it is,
because you were gone.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.800
Are we done for today? Good. Thanks.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.360
That went well...

11:39.800 --> 11:43.400
You'd be forgiven for thinking Jonna
has run inns all her life.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.720
-She's trying.
-You've let her take over.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.120
-She has had a lot of good ideas.
-What's happened to you?

11:53.640 --> 11:56.440
You left all this.
That's what happened to me.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.440
-Jonna is back and is trying to help.
-I was gone for two months.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.560
Should that mean more
than an entire life?

12:04.640 --> 12:08.280
No, but you could at least
give her a chance.

12:09.160 --> 12:14.000
-Okay, let's see how today turns out.
-Good.

12:14.800 --> 12:19.760
-But Oskar, a schedule?
-I know. Just give her a chance.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.640
Sorry.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.720
-Hi. Have you booked the flight?
-They've found her.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.080
-Where is she?
-Flying home.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.560
The embassy called an hour ago.
She got a...

12:40.640 --> 12:43.720
-An hour ago? Why didn't you call?
-I did. You were on the plane.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.400
Why didn't you leave me a message?

12:46.480 --> 12:50.240
I'm telling you now.
What difference does it make?

12:51.440 --> 12:54.960
It's not a direct flight, so she
won't be here until tomorrow morning.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.840
-She's all right, Lasse. Don't worry.
-Okay.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.800
Do you want to
grab something to eat?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.120
Sure. Let's do that.

13:09.760 --> 13:16.400
-What happens after Christmas?
-We have a few ideas. Events.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.840
We've talked about an event
for New Year's Eve.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.560
I was thinking further down the road.
I heard about the fire.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.520
-Yes.
-Was it deliberate? Kim told me.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.520
-She said you were a suspect.
-There was an investigation.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.200
They caught the guy and I'm sitting
here. What are you getting at?

13:36.280 --> 13:39.640
Is it such a strange question?
I remember how it was.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.600
-New loans, new plans?
-It's different this time.

13:45.400 --> 13:50.360
-How? What are you going to do?
-I am going to run the inn.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.640
-What?
-Nothing.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.960
That was always the plan.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.280
I was going to study in Stockholm,
then go back

13:58.360 --> 14:00.080
and run the family business.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.760
-You didn't even want to go back.
-Maybe I've changed?

14:06.040 --> 14:07.520
Right...

14:07.600 --> 14:10.920
-How was everything?
-Good, thanks.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.680
-Anything else?
-A glass of white wine, please.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.600
We'll have a bottle instead.
Do you have Napa Valley? Thanks.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.440
-We'll be here for a while, right?
-Yes.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.360
-Dessert?
-I'm good, thanks.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.880
-Have whatever you want. It's on me.
-Thanks.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.960
Yeah. Quiet!

14:42.520 --> 14:46.200
-So you're the one he was barking at.
-Hi!

14:46.280 --> 14:51.200
-Merry Christmas! Your annual.
-Thank you.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.760
Oskar usually brings this. He puts it
on the steps like he's Santa.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.440
-Are you sad Santa didn't come?
-Not really.

15:01.600 --> 15:07.960
-I take it you want milk.
-No, black is fine.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.120
You want it black?
Well, I'll be damned.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.440
-But first things first, right?
-Cheers!

15:25.560 --> 15:27.920
-That hit the spot.
-Sure did.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.240
We need your help.

15:36.600 --> 15:43.080
I've seen what you're doing up there.
I'm too old to climb up a roof.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.480
Darn it!
We'll have to find some other way.

15:45.560 --> 15:50.320
-I'd say so. I'm not going up there.
-Okay.

15:50.920 --> 15:56.560
Would you go out on the ice? We need
help finding the best fishing spots.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.640
Is that so?

15:58.720 --> 16:01.400
Oskar knows hunting, but not fishing.

16:03.920 --> 16:08.680
I can imagine...
Mauritz should see you now.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.800
-He would be proud.
-Very proud.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.000
Let's drink to that.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.280
Down the hatch!

16:23.480 --> 16:29.040
You know...
I won't share my best spots for free.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.880
-You get what you pay for.
-We'll agree on something.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.760
Good.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.040
-These go on the tables.
-Okay.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.840
-I was wondering...
-Forget it.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.680
After my ex, I swore never to wash
anyone's underpants again.

17:31.560 --> 17:36.360
Good to know, but I was wondering
if I could use the washing machine.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.640
-There you are.
-Hi.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.520
How are you coming along?
When do you think you'll be done?

17:43.600 --> 17:47.960
Hard to say. There's a lot
that needs to be replaced.

17:48.040 --> 17:51.920
Don't worry.
Everything is under control.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.600
That's reassuring.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.920
We are thorough.
It takes a little longer.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.720
Especially if you
stand around chatting.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.840
The washing machine is downstairs.
It's all yours.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.480
-Keep the change.
-Thanks.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.000
-I have a new job.
-Great.

18:26.080 --> 18:30.200
Yes, but I have a lot do
that would be great to take care of

18:30.280 --> 18:31.920
before Kim comes to stay with me.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.720
Do you mind taking her
while I finish everything?

18:35.800 --> 18:38.200
It's fine by me.
Let's see what she wants.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.200
-I need to go to Brussels tonight.
-How come?

18:45.840 --> 18:49.720
-That's where the job is.
-I'm not following.

18:49.800 --> 18:54.920
-You're not going to wait for her?
-Isn't it enough that you're here?

18:55.000 --> 18:59.040
I'm sure she wants to see you too.
Can't you go tomorrow?

18:59.120 --> 19:01.080
I'd prefer not to.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.560
You can meet up with her
and put her on a plane to Brussels.

19:04.640 --> 19:09.080
Seriously? She was robbed!
She has travelled for months,

19:09.160 --> 19:11.960
and you want me to put her
on another plane? Forget it!

19:16.080 --> 19:20.040
She can stay with me.
But then she's not going anywhere.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
Do you think
she wants to live on Åland?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.120
That's where you're planning to live.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.920
-Right?
-What? Yes.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.440
I think she'd prefer Brussels
to Åland.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.840
I guess we'll find out.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.680
-Keep in touch.
-Yeah.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.560
-Can you hug her for me?
-I will.

20:06.320 --> 20:11.000
Come here for a second.
The boat was found here.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.000
On open water.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.800
There was a strong wind,
so it could have drifted very far.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.800
What if the fire started in the bay?
Has the coast guard said anything?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.440
-Not a word.
-Typical.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.240
Ask our Estonian colleagues
to question the owner.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.000
-Andrus Ilves?
-He hasn't reported the boat stolen.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.520
But perhaps he just hasn't noticed
that it's gone.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.840
Okay, good.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.640
Gather around me.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.800
Here's our guide! Uncle Konrad.
I hope you brought good fortune.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.760
-I wouldn't get my hopes up.
-Konrad will show us the best spots.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.120
That's right! Not that it will matter
for you, Oskar.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.480
He couldn't catch a fish in
a fish tank.

21:49.320 --> 21:55.240
Be careful out there.
The ice can be a bit treacherous.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.640
Hi. I can't really talk now.
I'm with guests.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.960
<i>I've tried to call. Where are you?</i>

22:20.040 --> 22:24.840
Out on the ice, with the guests.
It's bloody freezing.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.800
<i>We were supposed to</i>
<i>have lunch today.</i>

22:27.880 --> 22:31.480
-Was that today?
<i>-I've texted you, called you...</i>

22:31.560 --> 22:33.120
<i>And now you say you forgot.</i>

22:34.760 --> 22:37.520
I'm running an inn. I'm busy.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.560
<i>Aren't Jonna and Lasse there?</i>

22:40.640 --> 22:43.320
Can't we do it some other time?

22:44.520 --> 22:47.960
<i>-Fine, bye.</i>
-Bye.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.880
Welcome! Come on in.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.200
Hi, welcome!

23:54.280 --> 23:56.920
Welcome. I'll show you to your table.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.440
-Are the ribs done?
-Yes.

24:11.440 --> 24:17.720
It's actually from a local brewery.
It's really nice.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.880
I'm glad you like it.
Enjoy your dinner.

24:32.440 --> 24:36.400
You have to hand it to Jonna.
It turned out really well.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.800
Whatever.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.480
I wonder if Anna-Lisa
is turning in her grave.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.880
I know what Mauritz would have said.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.040
-They need me in the kitchen.
-Okay.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.320
-Good work today, everyone.
-Thanks.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.800
Help yourselves to the bar.

26:35.240 --> 26:39.720
-Room for one more?
-If you keep your distance.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.240
Is this included in the experience?

27:03.600 --> 27:04.680
Staff only.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.040
Good thing I work here.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.760
-They tell me you're an actor.
-Who are "they"?

27:19.880 --> 27:20.880
Rumour has it...

27:31.760 --> 27:32.640
Who is Aino?

27:37.440 --> 27:39.040
"The only one."

27:40.280 --> 27:42.280
That's what Aino means
in old Finnish.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.040
Are you a romantic, Wille?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.800
-It's not your mum, is it?
-No.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.440
You've put her close to your heart.
Nice.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.920
-Is Aino your big love?
-Yes.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.760
-And you...?
-What?

28:04.840 --> 28:08.960
-What are you like?
-The life of an artist, you know.

28:09.720 --> 28:15.240
Nothing but red wine and romance.
Decadence, shotguns, you name it.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.280
-What's that?
-Don't you know?

28:21.840 --> 28:22.720
Give it to me.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.760
That's a shotgun.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.400
-You knew?
-No...

28:46.040 --> 28:47.480
-Such a prick!
-Watch it!

28:48.880 --> 28:50.240
Keep your distance.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.440
Take it.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.880
I'm taking a time out.

29:26.960 --> 29:27.920
Hello?

31:13.680 --> 31:15.520
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Dad.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.040
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.920
-Are you sure?
-I promise.

31:22.320 --> 31:27.200
-Where's Mum?
-She waited as long as she could.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.680
She had to leave.
Something to do with work.

31:31.440 --> 31:35.080
We were talking about you coming
with me to Åland. If you want.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.520
Sure, I just need to go home
and get my clothes.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.840
We can buy you new clothes.
Some early Christmas presents.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.960
-What? Why?
-It was Mum's idea.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.200
-To make up for not being here.
-Right.

31:54.760 --> 31:59.520
-Is there any snow on Åland?
-Oh yes. Absolutely.

31:59.600 --> 32:04.720
-Snow and baked ham.
-Good, I'm starving.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.480
-A glass of white wine, please.
-Right.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.080
-You might as well pour it yourself.
-Okay.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.480
Is anything where it used to be,
or has it all been moved around?

32:26.920 --> 32:30.960
-It made more sense this way.
-Does it make sense...

32:31.040 --> 32:34.640
...that only you can find things?

32:34.720 --> 32:37.880
No, but you don't have to move
all over the bar

32:37.960 --> 32:39.760
just to mix a simple drink.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.320
What is your problem?
-That I can't find anything.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.840
-Where are the straws?!
-Christ, here!

32:46.920 --> 32:50.280
-What's going on?
-There is a damn amateur

32:50.360 --> 32:52.400
running around thinking
she's a pro!

32:52.480 --> 32:54.680
I own a third of this place!

32:54.760 --> 32:56.160
Get used to it!

32:59.800 --> 33:01.560
Don't look at me. She's your wife.

33:09.760 --> 33:15.800
-Is everything to your satisfaction?
-It was delicious. Thanks.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.520
-I hope you had a good time. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

33:28.600 --> 33:34.160
-Jonna?
-Hello! Glad you could make it.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.520
I'd never miss Christmas dinner
at Waldemars.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.240
-I hope you're happy.
-Absolutely. It was delicious.

33:40.640 --> 33:45.280
I was going to call you,
but I've been swamped.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.920
But we found a builder.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.920
-Thanks for your help.
-You're welcome.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.000
-You still have my number, right?
-Yes.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.880
-Give me a call. We'll catch up.
-I will.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.920
-I'm going for a smoke.
-Cigarillo, fancy!

33:59.000 --> 34:03.280
-From time to time. Want to come?
-No, I've got things to do. Bye!

34:34.680 --> 34:36.000
Hi.

34:39.160 --> 34:43.640
I just wanted to apologise.
I don't know what got into me.

34:43.720 --> 34:48.600
It's been overwhelming, being back.
Especially since so much has changed.

34:48.680 --> 34:49.640
I understand.

34:50.600 --> 34:54.280
But you should have seen the state
of the place when we arrived.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.720
-You've done a great job. Thank you.
-Thanks.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.360
-We'll find a compromise.
-Definitely.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.440
Do we have a laundry service now?

35:32.800 --> 35:35.680
Hello. I want to file a report.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.880
-What happened?
-Someone is stealing laundry.

35:42.760 --> 35:46.800
I hung my clothes to dry yesterday,
and now they're gone.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.720
Case closed.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.520
Wait, wait.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.840
Okay.

36:40.280 --> 36:44.720
Wille Ek. What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

36:45.160 --> 36:46.320
Working.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.440
Hey!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.240
What you did

36:53.000 --> 36:56.080
is called breach of contract.
You could be liable for damages.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.800
-I'm not liable for anything.
-Is that so?

37:05.880 --> 37:10.400
<i>You have reached Oskar Waldemar,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

37:11.400 --> 37:14.960
Hi, it's me. I just called
to make sure you're okay.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.120
And I was curious about
how the opening went.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.600
I was thinking about this morning.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.560
I wanted to make sure you didn't
read too much into what I said.

37:26.120 --> 37:30.960
<i>I guess I just wanted to say that</i>
<i>I think we have something special.</i>

37:31.040 --> 37:32.840
<i>We can talk more later.</i>

37:33.840 --> 37:36.280
<i>Take care. Bye.</i>

37:39.400 --> 37:41.480
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.720
She's good. Jonna.

37:46.520 --> 37:50.640
You were right.
I will give her a chance.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.200
Thank you.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.120
Liv.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.840
I miss you.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.120
I've missed you too.

38:23.560 --> 38:28.000
-Liv, wait. Someone could come in.
-I don't care.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.720
-Hi.
-Hello!

39:00.720 --> 39:02.800
Hi, honey.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.360
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.200
The clan has been reunited.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.080
-To Kim.
-To Kim being home.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.560
-Cheers.
-Welcome home.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.600
You have to tell us.
We're so curious. What did you do?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.640
-It must have been super cool.
-It was.

39:26.480 --> 39:33.400
-What happens now? Back to school?
-I don't know.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.960
You don't have to
decide anything now.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.080
You were gone so long. Did you work?

39:38.560 --> 39:42.040
No, Fredrik paid for everything.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.320
-So what happened to this Fredrik?
-Not now, Oskar.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.160
Anything to do with Mildred's death?

39:49.240 --> 39:53.560
-She only just got home. Drop it.
-It was just a simple question.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.320
He completely lost it.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.800
Partied all night and slept all day.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.560
Alcohol, drugs...

40:03.280 --> 40:07.520
When I came home from the beach one
day, he was completely passed out.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.160
There was no waking him.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.240
Everything was gone.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.640
Money, passports...

40:25.080 --> 40:27.880
The police wouldn't help me
unless I paid them.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.960
When I came back to the hotel
he was gone.

40:36.880 --> 40:40.840
I don't know where he is.
I don't even know if he...

40:47.840 --> 40:50.040
It's okay, honey.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.600
Sorry I've been so busy.
I'll make it up to you.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.200
Move.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.560
What the hell?

42:58.840 --> 43:01.840
