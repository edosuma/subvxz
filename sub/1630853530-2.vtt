WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.092
Joyner-Kersee won gold
over Soviet Irina Belova

00:09.176 --> 00:10.761
in last night's race.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.096
And in Houston,
more questions are being asked

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
in the wake of the Polaris hotel disaster

00:15.766 --> 00:18.810
and the tragic deaths
that occurred in Earth orbit.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.854
NASA has vowed a full investigation

00:20.938 --> 00:23.815
and review
of its safety certification process,

00:23.899 --> 00:26.860
while some in Congress are questioning
NASA's lack of oversight.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.278
Can you please turn that off?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.656
-The tragedy has left the public asking--
-Yes, ma'am.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.119
Ms. Baldwin.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.789
Thank you for coming all the way out here.

01:20.873 --> 01:21.874
Sure.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.593
I am-- I'm truly sorry about Sam.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.803
Thank you.

01:34.887 --> 01:39.057
You two built something amazing together.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.689
It's why I asked you here.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.580
Is it not enough?

02:01.663 --> 02:04.291
No, it's very generous.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.169
So generous it makes me wonder why.

02:08.586 --> 02:12.090
Our company's reputation is in tatters.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.676
I mean, our debtors are calling in
their loans.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.305
I mean, if you were gonna
sell Polaris off for parts,

02:18.388 --> 02:20.265
you would make me a lowball offer.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.856
But you are not just in this
for the money.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.609
No.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.447
You know, I read somewhere
you're testing a new methane engine.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.283
From what I know,

02:38.367 --> 02:41.370
methane doesn't offer much advantage
for trips to the moon.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.540
But it does to Mars.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.043
From what I can tell,
Helios doesn't have a ship

02:48.126 --> 02:50.504
that could support a crew
for a two-year trip.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.341
So you must be five years away
from building one.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.927
Seven, actually.

02:57.010 --> 03:01.932
But if you were to acquire a ship
that could support human life,

03:02.558 --> 03:05.936
let's say my hotel,
and attach your new engines to it…

03:06.019 --> 03:08.272
That's a fascinating theory.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.781
You seriously think you can do it?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.995
My dad came to this country
with just a few shillings in his pocket.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.582
And he got a degree
and became an engineer.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.500
He believed what Jack Kennedy said.

03:28.584 --> 03:32.337
"In America… anything is possible."

03:33.088 --> 03:36.216
I can still remember him sitting
in that living room that night in '69,

03:36.300 --> 03:37.968
glued to the TV,

03:39.136 --> 03:42.055
watching the Soviets plant their red flag
on the moon.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.517
The tears were rolling down his cheeks.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.896
I had never even seen him cry before.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.276
Being first, it meant something.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.653
But you are going up against
the two wealthiest,

03:56.737 --> 03:59.239
most powerful nations in the world.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.201
And if they divide up Mars
like they did the moon,

04:02.284 --> 04:06.955
we'll never end this destructive cycle.
This "us… versus them."

04:08.749 --> 04:11.543
In Kenya, there's a Kiswahili word,
"harambee."

04:12.461 --> 04:15.797
It means "stronger together."
Mutual responsibility.

04:16.757 --> 04:21.053
That is what Helios is all about.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.934
That! That's what's gonna push mankind
to make the next leap forward.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.813
Colonizing Mars, and the moons
of Saturn and Jupiter.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.660
I suppose now your price goes up.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.329
That was a great speech.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.457
I mean, it was worth at least another 10%.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.716
Okay, Karen Baldwin. Done.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.680
I'll have my lawyers draw up
the paperwork.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.688
Congratulations.

05:52.561 --> 05:57.941
Five, four, three, two, one.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.367
Make a hole, people! Coming through!

07:46.300 --> 07:48.468
I need to see the generalissimo
right fucking now.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.469
She's not available.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.929
-She still in Huntsville?
-Yes.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.140
Well, maybe you can explain
this bullshit to me.

07:53.223 --> 07:57.603
I-- I can't, 'cause I don't read--
I don't read braille.

07:57.686 --> 08:02.774
I'll bet you transcribe every word the
mistress of darkness spews from her lair.

08:02.858 --> 08:06.028
What, she think I wouldn't notice
this gem buried at the end?

08:06.737 --> 08:11.408
"Astronaut candidates must conform
to criteria

08:11.491 --> 08:16.705
to be established by the Astronaut
Candidate Qualifications Committee."

08:16.788 --> 08:20.083
Ha! Committee of handpicked stooges,
no doubt.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.461
Of all the backstabbing, underhanded--

08:22.544 --> 08:23.670
You're overreacting.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.714
The committee is merely
an advisory board that's ju--

08:25.797 --> 08:26.798
Bullshit!

08:26.882 --> 08:29.635
This is a power grab. Plain and simple.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.514
-She's trying to force my hand.
-Force your hand?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.640
The Mars mission.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.727
Our fearless leader needs
to remember one thing.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.647
I decide who goes up and when,

08:41.730 --> 08:44.775
no matter what she writes
in any goddamn memo!

08:45.776 --> 08:47.402
Come on, Ollie. Let's go.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.327
Listen, with your getting
doctorates in advanced robotics

08:55.410 --> 08:58.622
and your lunar experience,
I think you are ideally suited

08:59.122 --> 09:01.416
to command the Mars '98 mission.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.382
The second mission to Mars.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.343
So let me get this straight.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.721
My advanced qualifications actually
worked against me going first?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
Well, yeah. They kinda did.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.437
I don't suppose the fact
that you and Ed go way back--

09:22.521 --> 09:25.440
Don't go there, Dani.
You and I go just as far.

09:25.941 --> 09:26.984
I know.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.736
But you're wrong on this one, Molly.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.156
Well, it's my call,
and that's how I see it.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.910
Yeah, there's no argument
you'd be better at handling the science.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.413
Someone with your qualifications
will be invaluable

09:39.496 --> 09:41.373
once the first flight's proven
it can be done

09:41.456 --> 09:44.710
and we start building the infrastructure
for a permanent base.

09:44.793 --> 09:48.046
But Ed is first, last
and always a test pilot.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.090
And he's used to handling the unknown.

09:50.174 --> 09:51.592
And a first flight to Mars

09:51.675 --> 09:53.677
is full of huge unknowns.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.141
He might not be the guy
who's gonna find life on Mars.

09:59.224 --> 10:03.437
But he is the guy who, I think, has the
best chance of getting the mission done

10:03.520 --> 10:05.772
and bringing everyone home alive.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.653
This sucks.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.407
Yeah, it does.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.579
And I totally understand
if you don't wanna lead his backup crew.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.372
So you think about that, you let me know.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.416
I don't need to think about it.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.376
I'll back him up.

10:27.169 --> 10:30.464
Whatever the program needs,
whatever Ed needs,

10:32.049 --> 10:33.050
I'll be there.

10:36.386 --> 10:41.099
Now, as you can see,
we can make methane, hydrogen and oxygen

10:41.183 --> 10:44.228
from the atmosphere
and water resources on Mars.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.481
Now, the question I pose to you is

10:47.564 --> 10:51.652
which technology offers the best trade-off
for a long-duration Mars mission

10:51.735 --> 10:53.362
with the goals we discussed?

11:00.619 --> 11:03.330
Now, remember, it's not just about mass.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.793
Keep in mind the power requirements
for liquification, transportation

11:07.876 --> 11:09.920
and storage in each case.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.297
D-mail your analyses to me
by next Wednesday.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.927
Belay that, children.
You can submit your work to Ken Muriata.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.972
He will be taking over this class
from now on.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.056
Why?

11:21.139 --> 11:22.516
Wasn't my call.

11:22.599 --> 11:26.812
The Astronaut Candidate
Qualification Committee has concerns

11:26.895 --> 11:31.316
about your availability
for the next couple of years.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.574
Don't fuck with me, Molly.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.909
Now, why would I do that, Admiral?

11:41.910 --> 11:44.037
Because you're drunk with power.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.040
I never should've given you that job.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.211
Well, we all make decisions we regret.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.965
I hope this doesn't turn out
to be one of mine.

11:59.595 --> 12:00.596
Seriously?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.473
That's right.

12:05.142 --> 12:09.021
Edward Baldwin is gonna command
America's first mission to Mars.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.154
Holy shit.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.324
Holy shit!

12:27.122 --> 12:30.250
-Do not fuck this up.
-Fuck this up.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.799
Hey there.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.553
Danny! What are you doing here?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.515
Came to pick up Mom's astronaut pin
from Sam's office.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.688
I remember the day that she got that.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.484
Sam was always so proud of your mom.
You know that?

13:39.403 --> 13:40.612
He was proud of you too.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.742
Way you pulled your life together
after everything.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.119
It's really great.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.416
Glad you were able to sell the company.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.209
At least you're walking away
with some money.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.544
Well, that's thanks to you.

13:56.545 --> 13:59.173
If you hadn't have turned off
that thruster, I--

13:59.256 --> 14:00.966
I wouldn't even be standing here.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.721
It wasn't completely altruistic.
Saved my own ass too.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.893
Guess I better get going.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.690
Hey, Danny?

14:20.986 --> 14:22.362
At the reception…

14:24.948 --> 14:26.533
why did you play it?

14:27.075 --> 14:28.076
Play what?

14:29.745 --> 14:30.954
That song.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.503
It was Amber's idea.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.214
She's a Billy Swan fan too.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.762
Well, it's a great song.

14:46.845 --> 14:47.846
Yeah.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.724
Good night.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.902
-Karen?
-Yeah?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.445
I lied just then.

15:04.363 --> 15:08.200
About the song. About you and me.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.536
-About everything. Look, just listen.
-Danny--

15:11.578 --> 15:14.665
Okay, the day of the wedding,
I felt sick to my stomach.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.376
I didn't know exactly what it was

15:17.459 --> 15:20.337
until I was out there
with the world spinning below me, but…

15:21.922 --> 15:23.465
in that moment,
I wasn't thinking about Amber.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.676
-I don't want to hear this.
-All I was thinking about was you.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.135
-That's not okay.
-It's the truth.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.346
-I don't care. I don't wanna hear it.
-I thought about your eyes.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.306
-What? Oh, my God.
-The smell of your hair, your lips.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.433
-Go. Get out of here.
-How I might never see you again.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.562
Hey! Stop it, right now. Stop it!

15:39.064 --> 15:40.649
That's enough!

15:41.233 --> 15:44.862
Jesus, I thought that
you moved beyond all of this!

15:46.989 --> 15:47.990
I tried.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.285
You don't know how hard I tried.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
Okay, well,
I'm not going through it again.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.206
You're not gonna start calling me
in the middle of the night again

15:56.290 --> 15:58.208
and showing up at my house drunk.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.960
It's not gonna happen, okay?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.089
You have to move on.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.008
Please.

16:07.092 --> 16:10.262
It was a mistake, okay? I'm sorry.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.015
It never should have happened.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.438
Is it because of Ed?

16:20.189 --> 16:21.190
What?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.984
I saw the way you both were
at the wedding.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.153
I can't believe you're gonna
get back with that son of a bitch.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.738
Oh, my God, Danny.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.948
The way he talks down to you, to everyone,

16:30.032 --> 16:32.075
like he's God's gift to this world
or something.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.703
Danny, this has nothing to do with Ed.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.205
Nothing! Okay?

16:36.705 --> 16:39.333
You need to go home to your wife.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.154
But I like John.

17:09.988 --> 17:13.534
He and I see eye to eye on most issues,
and we have a great rapport.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.202
It's not about rapport.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.914
It's about choosing a vice president
that'll add value to the ticket.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.540
Picking a moderate like McCain--

17:20.624 --> 17:22.835
Will help me attract Democrats.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.505
He favors lower taxes and spending,
and less regulation,

17:26.588 --> 17:29.842
but he's also pretty socially liberal
and a war hero.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.262
If something happened to me,
he'd make a great president.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.472
Well, we wouldn't really need
to worry about that

17:35.556 --> 17:37.724
if you don't become president
in the first place.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.603
You don't need another you.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.648
You need someone
who will shore up your weaknesses.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.358
Clinton's up by six in most polls,

17:46.441 --> 17:48.819
and he's got a 20-point edge
with male voters.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.321
Yeah, it doesn't matter
that I'm a former astronaut

17:51.405 --> 17:53.615
who put my life on the line
for over a decade.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.327
I'm running in a party
that's infatuated with alpha males,

17:57.411 --> 18:00.330
so I need one on the ticket. Is that it?

18:00.414 --> 18:03.584
Exactly. Preferably someone
who will excite the evangelicals.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.172
That's why I want you
to give another look at Bragg.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.009
It doesn't have to be someone you like.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.011
It has to be someone the base likes.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.181
You know what he said about Mars?

18:17.264 --> 18:18.849
He's in favor of a manned mission.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.019
Because, he says,
Mars is in the same orbit as Earth

18:22.102 --> 18:24.271
and has canals full of water.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.984
Okay, he's a little fuzzy on the science.
You'll bring him up to speed.

18:29.067 --> 18:33.488
The point is, he's a founding member
of the Conservatives for Jesus Christ.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.573
Yeah.

18:36.742 --> 18:39.077
Are we sure we want someone that far right
on the ticket?

18:40.704 --> 18:43.498
It's not about what we want.
It's about what we need.

18:48.837 --> 18:53.008
Okay. Set up a meeting,
but I am not making any promises.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.429
-Daddy!
-Oh, geez!

18:59.473 --> 19:00.766
Evil hand! Evil hand!

19:00.849 --> 19:04.436
Evil hand, you know, I haven't seen him.
I think the coast is clear.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.605
Look out, Daddy!

19:06.688 --> 19:09.942
-Oh, geez! He's coming for ya!
-Mommy! Help, Mommy!

19:10.025 --> 19:12.569
Get back, evil hand! Get back.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.614
-There it comes over here.
-Get back, evil hand!

19:15.697 --> 19:17.157
-Other side.
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

19:17.241 --> 19:18.283
Uh-oh.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.369
Yeah, Scotty!

19:22.371 --> 19:25.040
You did it! The victor!

19:36.969 --> 19:39.429
-Way to go, Admiral.
-Thanks.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.683
Hi, Bob.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.311
Hi, Bob.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.150
Hope that thing doesn't
slow you down too much.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.153
Nah. Just can't drive a clutch
for a few weeks.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.077
I rented one of those new
electric roadsters.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.329
No gears. Just raw power.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.125
Does zero to 60 in 3.4 seconds.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.252
Sweet!

20:13.964 --> 20:15.424
Congratulations on Mars.

20:16.425 --> 20:18.886
Looks like NASA still values age
over beauty.

20:18.969 --> 20:22.264
Hell no! This assignment cost me
a whole case of Glenfiddich.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.141
You know, Molly, she don't sway easy.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.226
-Don't I know it.
-Look, I promise you,

20:26.310 --> 20:30.856
I'll leave a whole crate of whatever
libation you fancy up there on Mars.

20:30.939 --> 20:35.110
Just so long as that geriatric cadaver
of yours doesn't wither away first.

20:35.194 --> 20:40.282
There is zero chance of that.
Everything is still rock solid.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.658
Except that leg.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.035
It'll heal soon enough.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.120
I hope so.

20:46.705 --> 20:51.043
Because if you stumble,
even for just one second,

20:52.377 --> 20:55.297
I'm gonna swoop in
and steal your seat in a heartbeat.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.967
Me and my backup crew are gonna be
breathing down your neck

20:59.051 --> 21:00.511
all the way to launch.

21:00.594 --> 21:02.846
I expect nothing less.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.936
Come on. Come on.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.162
Hey, Dad. How's your leg?

21:27.246 --> 21:32.251
It's fine. Which you'd know
if you ever returned my calls.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.710
I know. I'm sorry.

21:34.211 --> 21:36.547
Anyways. I got some news for you.

21:36.630 --> 21:39.132
Don't tell me.
Yvonne cracked up another car?

21:41.093 --> 21:42.594
No.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.806
You might as well know.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.810
She and I have-- We're splitting up.

21:49.893 --> 21:55.148
Wow. Less than a year.
That's a new record for you.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.943
You could at least pretend
to be sad about it.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.112
You're right. I'm sorry. That was mean.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.740
So, where are you moving now?

22:04.241 --> 22:06.201
Not back to the Shamrock, I hope.

22:06.285 --> 22:11.206
No. I actually found
a great new neighborhood.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.958
I think you'll love it.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.585
Really? Where?

22:20.382 --> 22:21.884
In this area right here.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.261
You got the mission?

22:24.761 --> 22:26.889
Holy shit!

22:29.183 --> 22:31.268
Congrats, Dad!

22:31.351 --> 22:33.645
Yeah. I got it.

22:33.729 --> 22:37.065
And word is the Russian engine's got
some serious teething problems,

22:37.149 --> 22:41.445
so, you bet your ass
the US of A's gonna win this race.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.990
And here's a kicker.

22:47.743 --> 22:48.994
How'd you like to come with me?

22:50.454 --> 22:51.538
Where, to Mars?

22:51.622 --> 22:54.333
You've been preparing for this
your whole life, Kel.

22:55.042 --> 22:59.087
Would NASA ever risk letting a family
fly together on a mission like this?

22:59.171 --> 23:02.174
Well, your old man's still got some pull
at the office.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.842
Me and Molly got an understanding.

23:03.926 --> 23:05.552
Yeah, the geezer network.

23:05.636 --> 23:08.514
This is a chance for you
to get your head out of the snow, kiddo,

23:08.597 --> 23:10.098
and back into the sky.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.684
I don't know. I--

23:12.768 --> 23:16.730
I'd have to put my research down here
on hold for four, maybe five years.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.400
I offer you a chance to be
one of the first humans on Mars,

23:20.484 --> 23:22.319
and you're talking about research?

23:22.402 --> 23:24.613
I just don't get it.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.533
Four years of Annapolis,
two years of flight school.

23:27.616 --> 23:31.161
You aced your astronaut training
and your first trip to Skylab.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.997
But instead of going back to space,

23:34.081 --> 23:37.835
you're chasing bacteria
in the ass-end of the world.

23:37.918 --> 23:42.506
This research is teaching us
how life might have evolved on Mars.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.425
We found a strain
of Sphingomonas dessicabilus

23:45.509 --> 23:47.761
that could survive
the extreme cold up there.

23:47.845 --> 23:51.181
So come with me,
bring some swing-a-lings with you,

23:51.265 --> 23:53.767
and figure out
how to grow some shit up there.

23:53.851 --> 23:54.893
Sphingomonas.

23:56.103 --> 23:58.897
Swingabangas. That's what I said.

24:01.859 --> 24:02.860
So…

24:05.404 --> 24:06.822
Are you in?

24:09.032 --> 24:10.492
Of course I'm in.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.789
Attagirl! It'll be just like old times.

24:15.873 --> 24:18.500
I love you. Always.

24:19.251 --> 24:22.045
Love you too, Dad. Always.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.630
Bye.

24:35.601 --> 24:37.477
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:42.316 --> 24:44.610
That scampi sure does smell good.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.989
Just be careful
you don't overcook that shrimp.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.408
A good commander
doesn't micromanage her crew.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.502
Guess that's why I didn't get the mission.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.255
Molly gave Mars to Ed.

25:06.632 --> 25:07.758
I'm his backup.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.385
Baby, I'm so sorry.

25:12.304 --> 25:13.722
I know how much you wanted it.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.943
You don't seem
all that broken up about it.

25:31.740 --> 25:32.741
Well…

25:34.826 --> 25:36.787
I gotta admit I am kind of relieved.

25:38.372 --> 25:40.040
I thought you were okay about me going.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.751
Look, I knew space was dangerous.
But it was kind of…

25:45.212 --> 25:46.964
an abstraction. You know?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.510
After what we went through up there.

25:51.593 --> 25:55.639
I know, I-- It's real now. I get it.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.560
But I am still slated to go up in 1998.
You know that.

25:59.643 --> 26:00.644
I know.

26:02.104 --> 26:06.024
But at least Isaiah will be out of school,
and he could use all the help he can get.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.110
I don't need help.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.820
Your midterms would suggest otherwise.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.239
You know I like to come from behind.
I'm on it.

26:12.322 --> 26:13.574
Was studying just now.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.951
Is that why I heard all that
simulated gunfire from your room?

26:17.494 --> 26:21.039
So, why are we talking
about you being home?

26:22.708 --> 26:25.335
Mr. Baldwin was selected
for the Mars mission.

26:25.419 --> 26:28.255
They picked the old white guy. Shocker.

26:28.922 --> 26:31.341
He gonna take a walker and colostomy bag
up with him?

26:31.425 --> 26:32.759
Okay, come on now.

26:33.677 --> 26:38.473
Hey, the good news is I will be around to
help you out with that AP history paper.

26:38.557 --> 26:39.850
What's the subject again?

26:39.933 --> 26:40.976
John Adams.

26:41.727 --> 26:45.147
John Adams, stuffing the courts
with Federalist judges.

26:45.230 --> 26:49.484
The age-old issue.
States' rights versus big government.

26:49.568 --> 26:53.280
Ellen Wilson and Bill Clinton are having
that exact argument today.

26:53.363 --> 26:54.781
This is going to be so fun.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.075
Now I really wish you got
that commander job.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.290
Careless spending led
Governor Bill Clinton

27:03.373 --> 27:06.418
to increase the sales tax in Arkansas
by 33%.

27:07.961 --> 27:10.088
And now he's hoping to become president

27:10.172 --> 27:14.218
so he can increase the Federal
government's spending by $220 billion,

27:14.301 --> 27:17.387
forcing every American to pay more taxes.

27:17.471 --> 27:20.224
This is why we need a true American hero
to fight for us.

27:20.307 --> 27:23.060
Senator Ellen Wilson will just say no

27:23.143 --> 27:25.729
to Clinton's disastrous
tax-and-spend policies.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.731
And that's why I'm running for president.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.943
Let's build a better future. Together.

27:32.110 --> 27:35.197
When your favorite pan
is a great grimy mess,

27:35.280 --> 27:37.032
try our new lemon-scented
degreasing formula.

27:37.115 --> 27:38.700
Very excited to have you here, sir.

27:39.284 --> 27:42.287
Governor Bragg.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

27:42.371 --> 27:43.997
I'm sure you have a lot on your plate.

27:44.081 --> 27:47.125
Well, somehow, I'm guessing
not as much as you, ma'am.

27:47.209 --> 27:48.502
Honored to be here.

27:48.585 --> 27:49.920
Sorry about all the mess.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.297
We're in the process
of moving our campaign headquarters

27:52.381 --> 27:55.884
to a larger building,
and it's been a bit chaotic.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.469
Believe me, I understand.

27:57.553 --> 28:00.430
We just had the Governor's Mansion
renovated last year,

28:00.514 --> 28:03.892
and I am still trying to find
my favorite pair of cuff links.

28:06.436 --> 28:11.191
Well, we haven't had much
in the way of personal interaction,

28:11.275 --> 28:15.195
but I've always admired the
straightforward way you carry yourself.

28:15.696 --> 28:17.531
I like to think we have that in common.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.116
I couldn't agree more.

28:19.199 --> 28:22.494
I have been a fan of yours ever since--

28:22.578 --> 28:24.580
Well, you know.

28:24.663 --> 28:26.707
-The tank?
-The tank.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.877
Heck, that was something.
I'm sure you hear that a lot.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.337
Only every day.

28:32.421 --> 28:35.299
Well, I've been keeping an eye on you
ever since,

28:35.382 --> 28:39.595
and your voice in the Senate has been
so valuable to the party.

28:39.678 --> 28:42.181
You're bringing us into the 21st century.

28:42.264 --> 28:44.516
Kicking and screaming, to be sure.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.102
Thank you for saying that.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.981
So, as I'm sure Larry made you aware,

28:51.064 --> 28:53.692
I'm considering my options
for a running mate.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.069
And before I make my final choice,

28:56.153 --> 28:59.531
I wanted to have a frank conversation
with you.

28:59.615 --> 29:02.117
-Only kind worth having.
-Good.

29:02.201 --> 29:07.080
There are several areas
where you and I don't see eye to eye.

29:07.873 --> 29:09.708
Stem cell research, for example.

29:09.791 --> 29:13.754
True. I do not support stem cell research.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.089
I am staunchly pro-life.

29:16.173 --> 29:17.341
As am I,

29:17.424 --> 29:22.596
but this is a promising area of
scientific research that could save lives.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.437
Look, I want my vice president
to be someone I can rely on

29:30.521 --> 29:33.607
for their honest, unvarnished opinion.

29:33.690 --> 29:34.691
Always.

29:34.775 --> 29:37.444
But I also need that person
to be on the same team,

29:37.528 --> 29:41.323
even if they don't agree with every
decision I make or every position I hold.

29:42.908 --> 29:45.035
There will be times
when I call on my vice president

29:45.118 --> 29:47.829
to advocate for something
they don't agree with.

29:49.873 --> 29:51.834
Is this something you feel
you could handle, Governor?

29:55.671 --> 29:59.258
Are there sacrifices that have to be made?
Of course.

30:00.133 --> 30:03.512
But sacrifice is a part of any journey.

30:03.595 --> 30:06.431
Ma'am, I'm going to be straight with you,
as you've been with me.

30:06.515 --> 30:10.227
There is no one
I would rather be following into a fray

30:10.727 --> 30:13.105
than a true American hero like yourself.

30:13.730 --> 30:17.985
It has been too long
that the Republican Party has been defined

30:18.068 --> 30:19.778
by people that look like me.

30:21.405 --> 30:25.409
I would be honored
if asked to serve with you.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.506
-Hey. You're back early.
-Hey.

30:39.590 --> 30:41.717
The electromagnetic containment guys
have the goods?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.135
It's very promising.

30:43.218 --> 30:47.222
Great. I-- You know, I gotta say,
I'm a little annoyed.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.765
Why?

30:48.849 --> 30:49.975
Well--

30:50.726 --> 30:54.229
I had a double sawbuck on Danielle
to command Mars '96.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.606
Thought it was a sure thing.

30:55.689 --> 30:59.484
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I understand why you went with Ed, but--

30:59.568 --> 31:01.361
Wait, wait. What did you say?

31:03.530 --> 31:04.573
No, just--

31:05.574 --> 31:08.952
I mean, you're picking Ed for commander.

31:16.627 --> 31:17.628
Right?

31:19.755 --> 31:22.090
Personality traits must be altered,

31:22.174 --> 31:27.137
which means Babe Ruth will be stuck with
what the organization initially selected.

31:28.472 --> 31:29.723
Easy, Ollie.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.978
Can you tell me why I have to hear
that you picked Ed Baldwin as commander

31:35.062 --> 31:36.396
from Bill Strausser?

31:36.980 --> 31:38.690
Well, I put it in a memo.

31:38.774 --> 31:41.235
I guess you didn't have a chance
to read mine yet.

31:41.318 --> 31:44.279
We agreed to continue discussing it
when I returned.

31:44.363 --> 31:47.616
Here you are,
and here we are discussing it.

31:48.659 --> 31:51.703
Oh, come on. You went behind my back
when I was out of town.

31:51.787 --> 31:52.996
Behind your back?

31:53.080 --> 31:55.916
You mean like putting together a
bogus committee for selecting the ASCANs?

31:55.999 --> 31:58.794
Those are some of the finest
scientific minds at this agency.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.880
Oh, come on. You are trying
to cut the balls off this office

32:01.964 --> 32:05.384
just like you have every other department
in this entire agency

32:05.467 --> 32:07.094
over the last ten years.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.595
That's what you think I'm doing?

32:08.679 --> 32:13.308
You don't like having someone around
who doesn't kowtow to your every whim.

32:14.101 --> 32:17.104
I don't care how many friends you got
in Washington.

32:17.688 --> 32:20.357
-I will not allow you to steamroll--
-Allow?

32:20.440 --> 32:22.192
You will not allow?

32:22.276 --> 32:23.610
Molly, this isn't the '60s,

32:23.694 --> 32:26.071
and NASA's not the same place it was
when Deke was around.

32:26.154 --> 32:27.865
And your blind refusal--

32:31.910 --> 32:34.162
-That's not what I meant.
-I know what you fucking meant.

32:34.246 --> 32:38.000
I'm done debating this with you.
My job is to assign all the flight crews,

32:38.083 --> 32:41.461
including who will command
the Mars '96 mission.

32:41.545 --> 32:42.546
So I did my job.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.340
-You should not have done that.
-Well, what's done is done.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.596
No, what's done is now undone.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.306
You're fired, Molly.

32:56.143 --> 32:57.227
You wouldn't dare.

32:57.728 --> 33:00.355
I would. And I did.

33:01.273 --> 33:04.234
Leave your badge at the desk
on your way out.

33:21.919 --> 33:23.128
Admiral Baldwin's here.

33:24.087 --> 33:25.714
-Hey, Ed.
-Hey.

33:25.797 --> 33:26.715
Have a seat.

33:26.798 --> 33:30.010
Did you get a chance
to look at my crew wish list yet?

33:32.679 --> 33:34.056
Ed, we need to talk.

33:35.557 --> 33:37.601
I know. It's about Kelly, right?

33:37.684 --> 33:40.562
Look, I get it. But it's not just
'cause she's my daughter.

33:40.646 --> 33:43.815
-She's abundantly qualified--
-Ed, it's not about that.

33:45.943 --> 33:46.944
Okay.

33:52.574 --> 33:55.077
You're not going to command
the Mars mission.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.580
What?

33:58.664 --> 34:00.457
-No, M-- Molly--
-Jumped.

34:01.667 --> 34:06.088
Jumped the gun.
Danielle Poole is the agency's choice.

34:13.804 --> 34:15.597
I don't understand.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.141
Ed, you're a great commander.
No one questions that.

34:18.225 --> 34:22.813
But Danielle's got a broader skill set
in planetary science and--

34:22.896 --> 34:24.106
This is bullshit.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.025
Jerking me around like this.

34:28.819 --> 34:31.822
I know. And I apologize.

34:33.197 --> 34:37.661
Wait, what the hell happened?
Why isn't Molly telling me this?

34:38.536 --> 34:40.330
Because it's my call.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.166
And Molly no longer works here.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.254
-As of when?
-As of today.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.590
So who's her replacement?

34:49.672 --> 34:51.925
Going forward,
flight crews will be determined

34:52.009 --> 34:55.094
by mission parameters
as defined by a selection committee.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.516
By a selection committee.

35:03.395 --> 35:05.314
By a selection committee.

35:06.273 --> 35:10.777
So the weenies and the white coats
are finally calling all the shots.

35:10.861 --> 35:13.697
I know this new system will take
some adjustment.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.866
Adjustment! Hell.

35:16.783 --> 35:19.286
The whole reason Deke built this system
was so we know

35:19.369 --> 35:24.208
that the guy making the call
has had his ass on the line just like us.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.506
But now it's just a bunch
of pencil-pushing sycophants.

35:31.590 --> 35:34.510
Bravo, Margo.
I hope you're proud of yourself.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.273
-No way.
-Look at him go!

35:51.610 --> 35:52.611
-He's crushing him.
-There it is!

35:52.694 --> 35:55.239
-Off to a strong start.
-There it is. All right.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.741
-Yo, Bombshell's gonna crush it.
-Come on. I wouldn't put my money on him.

35:57.824 --> 35:58.825
-He's gonna crush it.
-Look!

35:58.909 --> 36:00.619
Look. He's crushing him.

36:00.702 --> 36:03.080
-He's crushing him. He's crushing him.
-Come on.

36:03.664 --> 36:05.332
He got him up in the air!

36:08.085 --> 36:10.170
Oh, man.

36:14.132 --> 36:16.635
This hurts to just watch this.

36:16.718 --> 36:18.011
-Bombshell being destroyed.
-Hello?

36:18.095 --> 36:19.429
Man.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.224
-That's horrible.
-Hey, Margo.

36:22.307 --> 36:23.559
Hey. Yeah.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.729
Let the bot battle begin, and
here comes Bombshell with that package…

36:30.983 --> 36:32.109
You're kidding me.

36:32.985 --> 36:35.070
What happened to Ed?

36:36.613 --> 36:37.865
Why?

36:37.948 --> 36:40.951
Oh, my God. Margo, I'm-- I am so excited.

36:41.034 --> 36:44.121
And you are not gonna regret this.
Yeah? I promise.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.500
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

36:51.753 --> 36:52.880
Oh, my God.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.757
Oh, my.

37:22.910 --> 37:27.039
I never thought she'd do it.
I guess times really have changed.

37:27.122 --> 37:30.459
This is not the agency we signed up for.
That's for damn sure.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.505
I'm just glad Deke's not alive to see it.

37:35.506 --> 37:38.175
To Deke. Buzz.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.678
To you and me, a dying breed.

37:48.685 --> 37:50.145
You want this back?

37:50.229 --> 37:52.856
Pretty sure my short game is
as good as it's going to get.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.692
Probably get some good money
for it down at the Outpost.

37:55.776 --> 37:58.820
It's an authentic astronaut souvenir.

38:01.573 --> 38:02.991
The Outpost.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.411
There's another great institution
gone to hell.

38:10.123 --> 38:13.836
Yeah. Just like the two of us.

38:58.964 --> 39:01.925
Rosales, come on.
Let's get you checked in.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.262
Okay, Rin. Let's go.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.801
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.804
Scotch on the rocks. Thanks.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.107
Hi, Bob.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.361
I don't even feel like
saying that in here anymore.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.238
It feels wrong.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.911
Anyways, congratulations.

40:12.496 --> 40:14.498
First person on Mars.

40:14.581 --> 40:17.751
Ed, this is not how
I wanted things to go down.

40:17.835 --> 40:19.002
You know that.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.170
I'm sorry.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.798
You didn't do anything. NASA did.

40:23.715 --> 40:25.551
Bean counters have taken over.

40:26.635 --> 40:27.803
Gordo called this.

40:28.470 --> 40:31.807
Saw this bullshit coming way back
when we were on Jamestown.

40:33.016 --> 40:34.351
There's no room for pioneers.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.186
Who's the birthday girl?

40:37.688 --> 40:39.106
Three, two, one.

40:39.189 --> 40:40.566
Liftoff!

40:41.275 --> 40:42.651
Happy birthday!

40:46.989 --> 40:48.365
Liftoff.

40:50.826 --> 40:56.915
Well, in four years, you'll be
140 million miles away from this bullshit.

40:56.999 --> 41:00.127
I'll probably be over there in that corner
signing souvenirs.

41:00.878 --> 41:04.464
Not likely. Nobody here will have any idea
who the hell you are.

41:06.717 --> 41:08.093
Probably not.

41:13.390 --> 41:14.808
I guess I'll always wonder

41:14.892 --> 41:17.769
why I didn't land Apollo 10
when I had the chance.

41:20.564 --> 41:22.608
But at least that was my own doing.

41:23.525 --> 41:28.030
This, you know--
Just having it taken away from--

41:29.031 --> 41:30.115
And for--

41:34.369 --> 41:35.245
For what?

41:37.247 --> 41:38.248
Dani.

41:40.918 --> 41:42.503
I know what you're capable of.

41:43.754 --> 41:48.592
I trained you. I've flown with you.
Hell, I gave you your first command.

41:48.675 --> 41:49.718
But?

41:49.801 --> 41:54.014
But we both know
there are other factors at play here.

41:56.683 --> 41:57.851
Other factors?

42:00.187 --> 42:01.688
Like what, Ed?

42:01.772 --> 42:03.190
Come on, Dani.

42:05.067 --> 42:08.570
You're a damn fine astronaut.
Nobody's disputing that.

42:08.654 --> 42:11.949
But if this were a level playing field,

42:12.032 --> 42:14.576
I'd be commanding this mission,
and you know it.

42:23.627 --> 42:25.128
I don't even know what to say.

42:27.631 --> 42:32.261
I've heard crap like that my whole life,
but I never thought I'd hear it from you.

42:35.597 --> 42:36.682
Dani.

42:43.772 --> 42:45.691
Hey. Dani.

43:05.377 --> 43:06.420
Come on.

43:24.938 --> 43:26.315
What's wrong?

43:27.024 --> 43:28.358
I lost my watch.

43:29.735 --> 43:34.615
I'm sure it's around somewhere.
You'll find it. You always do.

43:34.698 --> 43:36.658
Is Javi there?

43:36.742 --> 43:38.118
Sí, sí…

43:40.037 --> 43:41.163
Javi!

43:43.874 --> 43:45.083
Javi!

43:45.167 --> 43:46.502
You and Vic getting along?

43:48.670 --> 43:50.422
I get along with him.

43:50.506 --> 43:52.341
He doesn't get along with me.

43:52.424 --> 43:55.802
Papá, please try to make it work
between you two, okay?

43:55.886 --> 43:56.929
-I can't--
-Hi, Mommy.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.932
Hi, baby. Do you know where I am?

44:00.891 --> 44:02.017
I'm on the moon.

44:02.100 --> 44:05.229
-Uh-huh.
-I'm on the Jamestown Base.

44:05.312 --> 44:07.231
You've seen it on TV, right?

44:07.314 --> 44:08.982
I am working on Sojourner 1,

44:09.066 --> 44:13.904
which is this big ship that'll take people
from the moon to Mars four years from now.

44:13.987 --> 44:17.324
Your mamá is working on the engines
that will take it there.

44:24.748 --> 44:26.166
He's watching the DuckTales.

44:32.464 --> 44:35.092
Papá, it's real.

44:35.759 --> 44:39.471
I'm actually here. I'm on the moon.

44:40.222 --> 44:41.306
Can you believe it?

44:41.390 --> 44:45.477
No. Your mother would be so proud.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.313
So proud of you.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.198
Yeah, I wish she was here too.

44:59.867 --> 45:01.869
Aleida,
I need to find my watch. I'm sorry.

45:01.952 --> 45:03.871
I have to make dinner at 6:00.

45:03.954 --> 45:05.455
I need to find my watch.

45:05.539 --> 45:06.999
Have you looked on the bedside table?

45:07.583 --> 45:10.210
-Maybe someone stole it.
-No one stole your watch.

45:12.087 --> 45:13.505
Papá?

45:14.381 --> 45:15.465
Papá?

45:25.225 --> 45:29.771
And now a man you know well,
your governor, Jim Bragg.

45:31.356 --> 45:32.858
Although unexpected,

45:32.941 --> 45:36.195
Senator Wilson's choice of
Governor James Bragg as her running mate

45:36.278 --> 45:40.115
is considered by many political analysts
to be a savvy political move

45:40.199 --> 45:41.742
by the Republican nominee.

45:41.825 --> 45:44.953
Governor Bragg's strong and consistent
conservative positions

45:45.037 --> 45:48.248
are expected to solidify
the evangelical vote.

45:54.379 --> 45:55.380
Ed?

45:56.381 --> 45:59.510
Jesus, what the hell are you doing here?

45:59.593 --> 46:01.595
Goddamn toy car.

46:02.304 --> 46:03.847
Hey, are you all right?

46:05.807 --> 46:07.226
Well, you're bleeding.

46:07.309 --> 46:09.061
Goddamn rosebushes.

46:09.770 --> 46:14.441
Okay. Well, I guess we're gonna go in
and get you cleaned up.

46:15.067 --> 46:16.443
Goddamn boot.

46:36.547 --> 46:40.884
I'll be pushing 70 by the time
the next Mars mission launches.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.429
You think
they'll be bringing on a geriatric?

46:45.055 --> 46:46.098
Fuck no.

46:48.809 --> 46:49.935
So what's left?

46:51.186 --> 46:52.896
More milk runs to the moon?

46:54.273 --> 46:56.400
Maytag repairs in low Earth orbit?

46:57.401 --> 47:00.237
I'm closer to the end
than the beginning, Kar.

47:03.198 --> 47:05.117
It's not how I wanted to go out.

47:13.917 --> 47:16.170
I know. You hate it when I mope.

47:18.505 --> 47:20.048
How you holding up with everything?

47:21.508 --> 47:24.261
Heard you sold the company.

47:25.721 --> 47:26.930
Yep.

47:30.184 --> 47:33.979
Yeah? I mean,
that's not the reaction you'd expect

47:34.062 --> 47:36.815
from someone with millions of dollars
in their bank account.

47:37.816 --> 47:42.070
Polaris was supposed to be
this whole new chapter.

47:43.572 --> 47:44.907
Now it's just gone.

47:51.663 --> 47:53.040
I guess this is the…

47:53.999 --> 47:57.628
big, beautiful tomorrow
we used to always dream of.

47:58.921 --> 48:01.089
A lot less shiny
than I thought it would be.

48:02.799 --> 48:03.800
Yeah.

48:04.718 --> 48:06.428
You ever wonder…

48:07.763 --> 48:08.764
What?

48:08.847 --> 48:13.769
…what our lives would have been like
if we hadn't met that day?

48:17.773 --> 48:21.401
You mean if I hadn't have run into
a burst pipe on Penfield Avenue

48:21.485 --> 48:23.737
and taken Friar
on the way to school instead

48:23.820 --> 48:28.033
and run into you in a vacant lot
setting off bottle rockets?

48:29.284 --> 48:31.245
I guess you have thought about it.

48:32.412 --> 48:33.747
Only once or twice.

48:36.750 --> 48:37.835
Who knows?

48:39.253 --> 48:41.755
Maybe I would have done something
completely different.

48:43.298 --> 48:44.842
Come on, Ed.

48:44.925 --> 48:48.387
You not be an astronaut? Yeah, right.

48:50.514 --> 48:51.974
Civil engineer, maybe.

48:54.017 --> 48:57.813
You know, my first year
at Annapolis, I thought about it.

48:58.605 --> 48:59.690
About leaving the Academy.

49:01.567 --> 49:03.360
-Really?
-Yeah.

49:03.443 --> 49:06.488
It was pure hell. I missed home.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.283
I missed you.

49:15.205 --> 49:16.540
So why didn't you?

49:18.667 --> 49:20.752
I wanted to fly.

49:22.504 --> 49:26.592
And I… didn't wanna let you down.

49:31.763 --> 49:34.433
I guess I did that anyway. Too many times.

49:44.902 --> 49:47.154
So why in the world a civil engineer, Ed?

49:51.491 --> 49:55.329
Be nice to build something that lasts.

49:56.914 --> 50:00.709
Like a bridge. Or a dam.

50:02.669 --> 50:05.672
I mean, I've been flying
for, what, 40 years…

50:07.007 --> 50:09.092
-Yeah.
-…and what do I have to show for it?

50:09.176 --> 50:12.638
Handful of medals. Mission patches.

50:13.138 --> 50:15.349
Faded photographs in newspapers.

50:18.060 --> 50:22.231
Enough to fill a shoebox in the closet.

50:50.175 --> 50:53.095
Hi. I'm Karen Baldwin, here to see Dev.

50:53.178 --> 50:54.429
-All right.
-Okay.

50:57.516 --> 50:59.351
Is this your first time at Helios?

50:59.434 --> 51:01.019
Yes, it is.

51:01.103 --> 51:03.772
If you get a chance after your meeting,
check out Building 2.

51:03.856 --> 51:05.691
That's where we assemble our rockets.

51:06.191 --> 51:09.111
We got this 3D printer
to make our engine parts.

51:09.194 --> 51:13.240
Dramatically reduces our production costs
and does wonders for quality control.

51:14.157 --> 51:15.158
Okay.

51:16.201 --> 51:17.494
Thank you, Renee.

51:18.829 --> 51:19.997
Karen.

51:20.581 --> 51:23.208
Is this your office?

51:23.959 --> 51:25.544
-Is something wrong?
-No, no.

51:25.627 --> 51:29.590
I don't know, I just--
I thought you would have an office.

51:30.174 --> 51:32.259
We don't have
a hierarchical structure here.

51:32.759 --> 51:34.386
We're a collective. Remember?

51:38.140 --> 51:39.850
So what'd you want to see me about?

51:39.933 --> 51:44.813
Well, I was wondering if you had chosen
a commander for your mission to Mars.

51:45.397 --> 51:47.274
-Not yet.
-How come?

51:47.941 --> 51:51.820
After our modifications to your hotel,
the spacecraft will be mostly automated.

51:52.487 --> 51:54.239
The crew will largely be caretakers.

51:55.199 --> 51:58.452
Okay. But you still need a strong leader.

51:58.535 --> 51:59.620
Indeed.

51:59.703 --> 52:02.581
Thankfully, we have a lot
of qualified astronauts here at Helios.

52:03.290 --> 52:06.543
Hey. Do you want a yerba maté?

52:08.045 --> 52:09.046
Sure.

52:11.924 --> 52:17.095
Look, a Helium-3 truck driver
isn't really going to cut it.

52:17.179 --> 52:20.307
You're going up against NASA
and the Soviets.

52:20.849 --> 52:22.726
I mean, if you intend to tell the world

52:22.809 --> 52:27.105
you're going to slap an outboard motor
on my hotel and drive it to Mars,

52:27.189 --> 52:29.441
Wall Street's gonna laugh at you.

52:29.525 --> 52:31.944
You need somebody
who can lend you credibility,

52:32.027 --> 52:35.155
somebody with a long, legendary résumé

52:35.239 --> 52:38.575
who can galvanize
the public's imagination.

52:38.659 --> 52:41.787
They'll be galvanized when we land on Mars
before anybody else.

52:44.122 --> 52:45.332
If you land.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.460
What happens
when something goes wrong out there?

52:48.544 --> 52:51.880
Communication between there and Earth
can take up to eight minutes,

52:51.964 --> 52:54.508
and you need somebody on the scene
who can improvise,

52:54.591 --> 52:55.884
adapt and overcome.

52:56.510 --> 52:58.178
Somebody who isn't gonna
buckle under pressure

52:58.262 --> 52:59.847
but, in fact, thrives under it.

52:59.930 --> 53:02.182
Why do I get the feeling
you got somebody in mind?

53:04.518 --> 53:05.561
My ex-husband.

53:08.522 --> 53:10.649
I assumed NASA was selecting him
for their mission.

53:12.818 --> 53:15.863
Ed's unhappy with the way
things are being run over there.

53:16.905 --> 53:17.906
Of course he is.

53:18.490 --> 53:20.158
He's looking for his next challenge.

53:20.784 --> 53:23.287
And I think he might just love
what you're trying to do here.

53:24.830 --> 53:26.123
You mean what we are doing here?

53:29.376 --> 53:32.129
Hey, everybody. Bring it in.

53:49.938 --> 53:51.398
This is Karen Baldwin.

53:52.191 --> 53:55.110
And she just pitched me
a very interesting idea.

53:55.736 --> 53:59.573
What do you guys think about having
Ed Baldwin command our expedition to Mars?

53:59.656 --> 54:01.909
-Love it.
-That'd be radical.

54:01.992 --> 54:02.826
Yeah.

54:02.910 --> 54:04.870
Like having Babe Ruth
on your baseball team.

54:06.747 --> 54:08.123
Babe Ruth's dead.

54:08.207 --> 54:11.335
I'm pretty sure Ed Baldwin's
not too far behind.

54:11.418 --> 54:12.628
No offense.

54:14.004 --> 54:15.881
But he's got the right experience,

54:15.964 --> 54:18.008
and no one's ever flown a ship like this.

54:18.091 --> 54:19.092
Exactly.

54:19.176 --> 54:21.887
And he's probably stuck in his ways
like everyone else at NASA.

54:21.970 --> 54:25.432
This is about leadership.
The mission's over two years long.

54:25.516 --> 54:27.226
We need somebody like him.

54:27.309 --> 54:31.021
I hear what you're saying, but maybe
we should give somebody new a chance.

54:31.897 --> 54:32.940
I think it's a no-brainer.

54:33.649 --> 54:35.150
He should have been first to the moon.

54:35.234 --> 54:36.652
Let's make him first to Mars.

54:40.113 --> 54:41.657
Interesting points of view.

54:42.574 --> 54:44.368
All in favor, raise your hands.

54:56.713 --> 54:59.800
Okay. I will talk to Ed.

55:13.605 --> 55:15.899
-Karen.
-Yes?

55:16.525 --> 55:18.277
-I forgot one thing.
-Yeah?

55:21.196 --> 55:24.157
Come work for me.
You practically already are.

55:24.241 --> 55:27.160
What? You're offering me a job?

55:28.620 --> 55:29.705
Doing what?

55:31.498 --> 55:32.583
Whatever you want.

55:34.209 --> 55:35.419
What does that mean?

55:35.502 --> 55:37.796
There's no official titles here,

55:37.880 --> 55:39.464
no real hierarchy.

55:39.548 --> 55:42.217
So start with doing
what you did for Polaris.

55:43.093 --> 55:44.428
You recruited the best astronauts,

55:44.511 --> 55:46.346
engineers and flight controllers
in the business.

55:46.430 --> 55:47.598
You know where the talent lies,

55:47.681 --> 55:50.434
and you know how to hook 'em.

55:54.438 --> 55:59.193
I appreciate the offer, Dev. I do.
But I don't think so.

56:00.777 --> 56:01.820
Karen.

56:03.322 --> 56:06.909
So you rolled the dice on a wild idea
and it didn't pan out.

56:09.203 --> 56:10.287
So what?

56:11.914 --> 56:13.832
Show me somebody who never failed,

56:14.333 --> 56:16.752
and I will show you somebody
who never took risks.

56:18.837 --> 56:21.215
I can't do it again. I'm really sorry.

56:21.298 --> 56:24.510
What better tribute to Sam's life

56:25.719 --> 56:30.766
than to help me take what
the two of you built to the Red Planet.

56:42.903 --> 56:46.156
Aleida Rosales worked out
the NERVA glitch in the lunar shipyard,

56:46.240 --> 56:48.200
so we have that back on the timeline.

56:48.283 --> 56:50.702
But we can't afford
another slip like that.

56:51.328 --> 56:53.038
Ninety-six sounds pretty far away,

56:53.121 --> 56:56.375
but those four years are gonna be gone
before we can draw a breath.

56:56.458 --> 56:58.418
Well, let's get started on the crew then.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.128
The sooner we get them in the loop,

57:00.212 --> 57:03.090
the faster we can get the hardware
and mission design up to speed.

57:03.173 --> 57:08.095
I have Ed's crew wish list here.
He'd already reached out to them.

57:11.932 --> 57:13.642
He wanted his daughter on the trip?

57:16.728 --> 57:18.355
If you want her or any of them,
just say so.

57:18.438 --> 57:22.442
If not, you'll have to give them
the bad news.

57:22.526 --> 57:25.612
Well, I already got some ideas
about who I want in my right seat.

57:27.197 --> 57:29.366
Now, as you know, he's a damn good pilot,

57:29.449 --> 57:32.953
and his knowledge of advanced avionics
will come in real handy up there.

57:34.746 --> 57:35.956
Excuse me.

57:37.165 --> 57:38.166
What is it?

57:38.250 --> 57:40.085
There's something on the news
you may wanna see.

57:41.128 --> 57:42.254
Thanks, Nuri.

57:46.592 --> 57:48.510
Soloflex. Simple--

57:48.594 --> 57:50.345
Flame-broiled perfection.

57:51.722 --> 57:53.932
And I'd like to welcome
the co-founder of Polaris,

57:54.016 --> 57:56.310
Karen Baldwin, to the Helios family.

57:58.937 --> 58:01.481
So now he wants to be
the next Conrad Hilton?

58:01.565 --> 58:05.527
Some say private citizens
have no business in space travel.

58:05.611 --> 58:08.322
Well, I emphatically disagree.

58:08.405 --> 58:11.450
The first hot-air balloon
to carry a human being aloft

58:11.533 --> 58:13.994
was designed by the Montgolfier brothers.

58:15.287 --> 58:20.042
The first powered aircraft was built
by a pair of bicycle makers,

58:20.626 --> 58:21.710
Wilbur and Orville Wright.

58:23.128 --> 58:26.340
Charles Lindbergh made
the first solo flight across the Atlantic

58:26.423 --> 58:28.550
in a plane built by a private company.

58:29.176 --> 58:30.469
And Robert Goddard,

58:30.552 --> 58:33.680
he built the first liquid-fueled rocket
that streaked into the heavens

58:34.556 --> 58:36.934
on his little farm
in Auburn, Massachusetts.

58:37.017 --> 58:41.104
We acquired Polaris to enable us
to embark on a bold new expedition,

58:41.188 --> 58:42.981
taking us where no man has gone before.

58:43.065 --> 58:46.568
By adding our groundbreaking
new Osprey-methane engines to it,

58:47.361 --> 58:49.863
we will propel
this one-of-a-kind spacecraft

58:49.947 --> 58:53.951
out of Earth orbit on an epic journey
of exploration…

58:55.994 --> 58:56.995
to Mars.

59:02.501 --> 59:04.044
Ladies and gentlemen of the world,

59:05.212 --> 59:06.880
I am thrilled to present to you…

59:08.382 --> 59:09.633
Phoenix.

59:12.928 --> 59:16.431
We will establish a free enterprise zone
on the Red Planet

59:16.515 --> 59:20.269
so that innovation
and economic development will thrive,

59:20.352 --> 59:25.524
building a new colony,
a new society benefiting all people.

59:25.607 --> 59:27.317
But don't take my word for it.

59:27.401 --> 59:29.820
Take the word of the man
who will command our mission.

59:31.280 --> 59:35.117
A living legend
whose experience reaches back

59:35.200 --> 59:37.619
to the earliest days of space exploration.

59:38.203 --> 59:40.038
The man who commanded
the first lunar base,

59:40.122 --> 59:43.542
staying alone when his crew
had to return to Earth.

59:43.625 --> 59:47.921
The first commander to operate
a nuclear engine in space.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.258
Ed Baldwin.

1:00:00.851 --> 1:00:02.227
-What the…
-…hell?

1:00:04.855 --> 1:00:06.106
Thanks, Dev.

1:00:09.026 --> 1:00:12.905
Ed Baldwin won't have to wait four years
to lead our expedition.

1:00:13.405 --> 1:00:17.367
We'll be going
in the next Mars launch window, 1994,

1:00:17.451 --> 1:00:21.330
a full two years before NASA
or the Soviet Union.

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:25.083
The future belongs to all of us.

1:00:50.692 --> 1:00:52.694
Way to go, Ed.

1:00:53.195 --> 1:00:55.822
Stick it to the bastards.
