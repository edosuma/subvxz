Next on FOX, Carmen Electra stars in Boobs,

01:06.544 --> 01:08.615
about a class of remedial reading students

01:08.652 --> 01:10.888
and their teacher who wants to be taken seriously.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.298
I thought it was about her boobs.

01:15.731 --> 01:18.406
Tonight on jock center a slugger on 'roids,

01:18.442 --> 01:22.480
Tiger Woods is annoyed, and 
North Korean missiles deployed.

01:23.275 --> 01:25.292
But first, the commissioner of pro football

01:25.316 --> 01:27.431
has announced plans to expand the league.

01:27.475 --> 01:31.109
Owners will meet soon to award 
a new team to one lucky city.

01:31.529 --> 01:35.131
Well, it's a cinch Springfield 
won't be that lucky city.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.851
Yeah, the only thing we're known for

01:36.862 --> 01:39.274
is leading the country in heart attacks.

01:43.409 --> 01:45.650
I've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'.

01:45.707 --> 01:47.908
I, Homer Simpson, will personally bring

01:47.908 --> 01:50.403
the new pro football franchise to Springfield.

02:00.267 --> 02:01.509
God, we have fun.

02:01.571 --> 02:04.277
Homie, snagging a pro football franchise

02:04.288 --> 02:07.563
is a big project, requiring 
a lot of follow-through.

02:07.992 --> 02:10.235
And that's not your strong suit, big guy.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.467
I'll show you all.

02:11.553 --> 02:14.485
I'm going to spearhead the 
hell out of this expansion bid.

02:41.730 --> 02:43.815
Homie, you've been down here for a week.

02:43.741 --> 02:45.081
I really think you need...

02:45.978 --> 02:49.097
what the Hellmann's real mayonnaise?!

02:49.203 --> 02:52.276
Marge, meet pro football's newest team;

02:52.565 --> 02:54.506
the Springfield Meltdowns!

02:54.814 --> 02:57.087
Plus, I designed a state-of-the-art stadium.

02:57.150 --> 02:59.114
We'll fund it with corporate naming rights.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.401
It's the duff beer krustyburger buzz cola

03:01.450 --> 03:03.553
costington's department store kwik-e-mart

03:03.614 --> 03:04.791
stupid flanders park.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.776
So... Homer do good?

03:08.384 --> 03:10.672
Homer do great!

03:14.090 --> 03:17.373
Maybe Homer brush teeth first?

03:21.174 --> 03:24.351
Gentlemen, I've narrowed our choice 
of expansion cities down to two:

03:24.481 --> 03:25.374
Springfield...

03:26.250 --> 03:28.049
I own slums there!

03:28.089 --> 03:30.987
...And Los Angeles, which has 
sent us this videotape.

03:32.001 --> 03:34.214
I love L.A.

03:34.896 --> 03:38.757
Oh, hi. I'm Rob Reiner, director 
of When Harry met Sally.

03:39.089 --> 03:41.565
"I'll have what she's having" was one of the lines.

03:42.915 --> 03:44.722
I'm here to tell you why you should choose

03:44.747 --> 03:46.298
L.A. Over Springfield.

03:47.259 --> 03:52.045
L.A. Has the beach, a thriving music scene, 
and the beautiful getty museum.

03:52.475 --> 03:55.804
Springfield has Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.

04:02.717 --> 04:06.745
Hollywood takes in talented actors 
and writers from all over the world.

04:06.964 --> 04:09.900
Springfield takes in garbage from other cities.

04:17.254 --> 04:19.024
But don't just take my word for it.

04:19.060 --> 04:22.221
Some of hollywood's biggest stars have taken the time

04:22.233 --> 04:26.360
to sign waivers allowing celebrity 
impersonators to sing in this video.

04:28.859 --> 04:37.067
Enjoy! L.A. Makes great movies 
and awesome tv shows

04:37.161 --> 04:43.480
Springfield don't make nothin' 
because Springfield blows

04:44.548 --> 04:46.814
Springfield blows

04:47.927 --> 04:50.042
Springfield blows

04:51.134 --> 04:54.059
Springfield blows

04:54.231 --> 04:56.997
Yes, Springfield blows...

04:59.513 --> 05:01.259
I'm sick of L.A.!

05:01.283 --> 05:04.370
They got earthquakes, wildfires, bennifers,

05:04.480 --> 05:08.270
brangelinas, and that potty mouth, Sarah Silverman!

05:08.295 --> 05:09.254
To hell with all of 'em!

05:09.291 --> 05:14.098
I didn't kill my husband to get control 
of his franchise to give a team to

05:14.135 --> 05:14.984
Los Angeles!

05:15.029 --> 05:16.376
Then Springfield it is!

05:19.119 --> 05:24.227
Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go 
tell my gay grandson I still love him.

05:24.297 --> 05:26.818
This is Kent Brockman live at duff beer krustyburger

05:26.855 --> 05:29.865
buzz cola costington's department 
store kwik-e-mart stupid flanders park.

05:30.020 --> 05:32.134
In just one hour, the commissioner of football

05:32.171 --> 05:34.396
will arrive to sign the contracts necessary

05:34.504 --> 05:39.628
to make Springfield the home of pro 
football's newest team the Meltdowns!

05:39.763 --> 05:41.110
I've got melt mania!

05:41.147 --> 05:43.277
I got downs syndrome!

05:43.789 --> 05:46.396
In honor of the commissioner's visit, 
the city has been repainted

05:46.457 --> 05:49.891
in the team colors and all the 
streets whimsically renamed.

05:49.965 --> 05:52.890
"Touchdown avenue"? Delightful.

05:52.993 --> 05:54.352
Who ya talkin' to?

05:54.383 --> 05:56.362
Your imaginary girlfriend?

05:57.218 --> 05:59.766
Isn't your mother a well-known whore?

06:00.867 --> 06:03.499
You win this round, Mel.

06:04.109 --> 06:07.185
It is my honor to introduce 
the commissioner of football,

06:07.373 --> 06:09.477
Mr. Bud Armstrong!

06:13.894 --> 06:16.326
There, seems to be some delay.

06:18.236 --> 06:20.531
Did I ever tell you people about the time

06:20.539 --> 06:21.726
I met Lloyd Bridges?

06:21.784 --> 06:23.383
Yeah, you passed him in the airport.

06:23.407 --> 06:24.842
Yes, but which airport?

06:24.912 --> 06:26.768
Hartsfield in Atlanta.

06:32.063 --> 06:35.665
This map says things like "Oak street" 
and "Evergreen terrace,"

06:35.692 --> 06:38.406
But all I see are "two-point-conversion avenue"

06:38.399 --> 06:41.795
and  "off-season knee surgery boulevard"?

06:42.253 --> 06:44.429
I'd better call and ask for directions.

06:46.337 --> 06:48.365
I'll just blackberry my assistant.

06:51.071 --> 06:52.027
My god!

06:52.401 --> 06:53.596
what a day.

06:56.069 --> 06:56.885
who are you?

06:56.901 --> 06:57.553
What do you want?

06:57.614 --> 06:58.450
What year is it?

06:58.524 --> 06:59.392
Who are you?

06:59.558 --> 07:00.615
I have to borrow your phone.

07:00.689 --> 07:02.851
And I also need to use your bathroom.

07:03.081 --> 07:04.831
As you can tell, I've been crying.

07:06.690 --> 07:11.178
Tonight on 48 minutes, we look 
at america's number one problem:

07:11.384 --> 07:15.847
Criminals who prey on the elderly 
people who watch this program.

07:16.215 --> 07:20.385
I'd go to some geezer's house and ask 
to use their phone or their bathroom.

07:20.513 --> 07:22.259
Well, I'm done with the bathroom.

07:22.321 --> 07:24.116
Now I'm going to make that phone call.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.424
Then I'd steal their wallets,

07:26.449 --> 07:29.052
jewelry and pictures of their grandkids.

07:29.088 --> 07:33.466
I made a collage of these, and when 
you step back, it looks like my face.

07:38.780 --> 07:41.040
If i knock him out, I'll be a hero.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.226
And people will listen to my loose-brained nonsense.

07:55.171 --> 07:59.271
By the shores of gitche gumee 
by the shining big sea water

07:59.448 --> 08:01.585
stood the wiggum of nokomis...

08:02.684 --> 08:04.286
I'm sorry, did I just say "Wiggum"?

08:04.353 --> 08:06.123
I... I meant "wigwam."

08:06.171 --> 08:07.891
Yeah, let me, et me start again.

08:12.594 --> 08:15.704
It's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.372
Maybe he's thinking of a new 
shape for the football.

08:24.803 --> 08:28.799
Not so tough when someone hits you 
from behind with golf club, are ya?

08:28.922 --> 08:32.365
Grampa, that's the commissioner of football!

08:33.905 --> 08:37.409
I thought he was trying to steal my jewels and

08:37.422 --> 08:39.999
all  them pictures of Bert and Lucy.

08:41.163 --> 08:44.520
I am never coming back to this city, 
and neither is the league!

08:44.520 --> 08:45.491
You mean....

08:45.541 --> 08:49.689
that's right. The Springfield Meltdowns 
football club shall never be!

08:51.764 --> 08:53.596
You're a useless old man.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.618
Name one thing you do for this family.

08:55.671 --> 08:56.997
I watch the baby.

08:57.147 --> 08:58.689
Where is the baby?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.182
You left me with a baby?!

09:03.786 --> 09:06.760
Hey, Abe! Thanks for losing us our football team.

09:06.864 --> 09:09.441
Thanks to you, we have a 
hundred-million-dollar stadium

09:09.459 --> 09:12.422
we can only use for farmers' markets!

09:15.276 --> 09:19.700
Nobody loves you when you're old and gray

09:23.918 --> 09:28.822
nobody needs you when you're upside down

09:32.300 --> 09:36.234
everybody's hollering about their own birthday

09:40.404 --> 09:45.475
everybody loves you when 
you're six foot in the ground.

09:47.198 --> 09:49.442
You're the only smile I got.

09:52.806 --> 09:54.841
Abe, I know you've been real depressed lately

09:54.879 --> 09:57.644
on account of everyone hating ya, including me.

09:58.335 --> 10:00.360
But I thought you might want to call this number.

10:01.145 --> 10:01.948
A doctor?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.981
I already got enough doctors 
touching me and poking me

10:05.068 --> 10:07.802
and squeezing me up here 
and jiggling me down there,

10:07.982 --> 10:09.691
and that's just the receptionist!

10:09.752 --> 10:10.684
Abe, Abe, Abe!

10:10.949 --> 10:14.270
This doctor helps old people to kill themselves.

10:14.606 --> 10:15.639
Euthanasia?

10:15.782 --> 10:16.502
No way!

10:16.699 --> 10:18.390
I want to die with dignity.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.240
Like slipping in the shower 
and then they find me

10:21.342 --> 10:25.703
two weeks later, swollen up so bad,
they don't know if I'm man or sofa.

10:25.843 --> 10:27.471
Just go for a visit.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.232
There's a Howard Johnson's next door.

10:29.299 --> 10:30.436
You'll get some pie.

10:35.626 --> 10:39.226
Mr. Simpson, you are a good 
candidate for assisted suicide.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.052
Aw, I think you're cute, too.

10:42.145 --> 10:44.305
But killing yourself isn't as easy

10:44.362 --> 10:46.491
as putting on an ugly sweater like you did today.

10:46.657 --> 10:50.142
I want you to carefully think about this for 24 hours.

10:50.290 --> 10:51.479
Oh, I see.

10:51.676 --> 10:55.464
You want me to reconsider whether or 
not I really should give up my life.

10:56.541 --> 10:59.275
Yeah, and we're cleaning out 
the death machine today.

10:59.339 --> 11:00.831
A lot of gunk gets stuck in it.

11:04.711 --> 11:10.179
Okay, if I get a single phone call 
in the next 24 hours, I'll keep on

11:10.226 --> 11:10.602
living.

11:10.856 --> 11:13.382
If you go, can I have your blanket and your liver?

11:13.661 --> 11:14.527
Blanket? Sure.

11:14.629 --> 11:15.516
Liver? Never!

11:17.923 --> 11:20.584
Homie, you should give your dad a call.

11:20.643 --> 11:22.605
You can't stay mad at him forever.

11:23.048 --> 11:24.289
Yeah, you're right.

11:25.461 --> 11:26.096
Y'ello.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.429
You want my opinion on current movies?

11:28.636 --> 11:30.597
Well, first of all, they're all perfect.

11:30.821 --> 11:32.887
Also, when's the Cap'n crunch movie coming out?

11:33.016 --> 11:34.623
And  will it be "r" or "hard r"?

11:43.395 --> 11:44.240
That's it.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.844
It's time for me to die.

11:46.238 --> 11:49.421
I'll just get mad about one 
thing in the newspaper, then go.

11:50.138 --> 11:51.369
President visits Europe?!

11:51.633 --> 11:53.062
On my dime?!

11:53.991 --> 11:56.475
I am so honored that you've 
chosen me to murder you.

11:56.570 --> 11:59.836
You'll be following in the footsteps 
of Socrates, Virginia Woolf,

11:59.886 --> 12:03.225
Ernest Hemingway, Hunter S. Thompson and Fred Kanickee.

12:03.361 --> 12:04.332
Who's Fred Kanickee?

12:04.389 --> 12:05.735
My appointment before you.

12:05.868 --> 12:06.431
Nice guy.

12:06.479 --> 12:07.012
Just a little...

12:07.417 --> 12:08.053
Little screwed up.

12:08.579 --> 12:11.449
Now, it is time to hook you up to the diepod.

12:21.099 --> 12:22.424
As you surrender your body,

12:22.659 --> 12:25.810
what music and visual imagery 
would you like to experience?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.314
I want to hear the Glenn Miller orchestra,

12:28.377 --> 12:30.547
and I want to see cops beating up hippies.

12:56.111 --> 12:57.071
One minute to go.

12:58.113 --> 13:01.191
Hands off the stiff, manfred manslaughter!

13:01.875 --> 13:05.381
The voters just overturned 
the assisted suicide law.

13:07.479 --> 13:08.742
I'll kill you all!

13:08.939 --> 13:09.972
When the law's reversed.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.826
Ha, I'd like to see you try!

13:12.139 --> 13:13.159
When the law's reversed.

13:13.771 --> 13:16.349
I think you know my brother-in-law, 
Fred Kanickee.

13:16.654 --> 13:17.165
Hoo, boy.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.421
I'm dead!

13:23.598 --> 13:25.591
I never felt so alive!

13:25.661 --> 13:28.187
And I got my 16-year-old body back!

13:32.136 --> 13:32.574
Look out!

13:32.678 --> 13:33.378
Hey, idiot!

13:33.737 --> 13:34.457
Now let's see.

13:34.536 --> 13:36.049
Am  I in heaven or hell?

13:37.475 --> 13:40.616
That's odd. You'd think they'd 
come back as the cows.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.240
Charlie Chaplin?

13:43.435 --> 13:44.802
They sure put you to work.

13:45.024 --> 13:45.849
You said it.

13:45.966 --> 13:46.978
And you can talk!

13:47.120 --> 13:48.017
Good for you.

13:52.962 --> 13:53.306
What the...

13:54.292 --> 13:55.763
you're all dead, too?!

13:55.972 --> 13:58.549
So who went berserk, fatso or the little guy?

13:58.718 --> 14:00.784
We're not dead, and neither are you.

14:00.906 --> 14:01.960
I'm not?!

14:02.172 --> 14:07.003
I guess if you want to commit suicide 
around here you got to do it yourself.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.686
Suicide?!

14:08.737 --> 14:11.262
Grampa,  killing yourself is a sin.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.896
God wants us to die of old age

14:13.927 --> 14:16.933
after years of pain and reduced mobility.

14:17.066 --> 14:21.344
I ain't going to kill myself, 
'cause I just learned something.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.819
The brief time I thought I was dead

14:27.903 --> 14:32.150
was the happiest I've ever been because 
I was finally living without fear

14:32.248 --> 14:35.848
and dagnabit, that's the way I'm 
going to live the rest of my life.

14:38.094 --> 14:41.767
I am, I am, I am superman

14:42.003 --> 14:45.707
and I know what's happening

14:48.106 --> 14:52.259
I am, I am, I am superman

14:52.518 --> 14:54.594
and I can do anything.

14:54.648 --> 14:56.849
You're all going to die in a pointless war.

15:00.877 --> 15:03.705
We're here tonight to discuss possible uses for this

15:03.762 --> 15:07.120
football stadium, including the solid gold statue

15:07.137 --> 15:09.010
of Mike Ditka with diamond eyes.

15:09.116 --> 15:13.717
I suggest we use the stadium for 
the ancient art of the toreador

15:14.101 --> 15:15.114
bullfighting.

15:16.246 --> 15:17.451
No, wait, wait!

15:17.533 --> 15:20.413
Bullfighting is a cruel pseudo-sport.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.284
Lisa's right.

15:21.397 --> 15:23.213
It is a cool, super sport.

15:23.307 --> 15:27.971
Everyone in favor of bringing 
bullfighting to Springfield say "ole!"

15:28.058 --> 15:29.435
Ole!

15:29.487 --> 15:30.071
So ordered.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.702
All we need now is, uh, er, uh,

15:32.737 --> 15:37.443
er, uh, uh, er, uh, er, uh, a, uh... matador.

15:37.602 --> 15:38.990
If it's all the same to you,

15:39.079 --> 15:40.957
I'll take on those bulls.

15:41.055 --> 15:42.296
Grampa, no!

15:42.435 --> 15:43.698
Grampa, si!

15:44.027 --> 15:46.448
If the bull dies, the crowd goes wild.

15:46.566 --> 15:48.809
If grampa dies, the crowd goes wild.

15:48.987 --> 15:52.545
Either way, we make a fortune 
on souvenirs and snacks.

15:53.235 --> 15:54.926
Can we bring outside food?

15:55.171 --> 15:57.279
Not even gum.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.890
Is the practice bull ready?

16:05.420 --> 16:06.010
Hell, yeah.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.410
Ole!

16:14.030 --> 16:16.930
A penny. This is my lucky day.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.830
Yep, my lucky day.

16:30.550 --> 16:35.060
How many bulls must my grandfather kill 

16:35.060 --> 16:36.440
She's so cute.

16:36.630 --> 16:38.380
We'll bring you the bull's heart, sweetie.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.510
Had my doubts, but grampa sure 

16:46.510 --> 16:48.980
looks manly in those leggings.

16:49.150 --> 16:51.140
And I don't know who's more handsome, 

16:51.240 --> 16:53.600
the bull taunter or the bull stabber.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.119
And the corrida del toro has begun.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.329
The bull charges at grampa Simpson.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.030
And he avoids the toro with a masterful Veronica.

17:18.150 --> 17:19.720
This old man has no fear.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.630
Like the fear I feel that I have left 

17:21.630 --> 17:24.130
the iron on at home. Have I? Have I?!

17:25.359 --> 17:27.450
And another Veronica. And another.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.750
That last Veronica means everyone 
here today has won a free side

17:29.750 --> 17:33.210
of rice and beans at the Springfield taco pronto.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.490
Tired of waiting two hours for a taco?

17:35.840 --> 17:36.750
Go to taco pronto!

18:13.660 --> 18:16.010
Grampa, I think you should give up the bullfighting.

18:16.190 --> 18:16.930
Forget it.

18:17.050 --> 18:20.770
I'd look pretty stupid in this outfit 
walking around fighting oysters.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.120
But you just got a new lease on life.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.640
Why would you want to use it 
to hurt poor, helpless animals?

18:25.890 --> 18:30.500
Listen, I'm 83 years old, and for the first time

18:30.660 --> 18:32.610
in my life people are cheering for me.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.330
I was always cheering for you, grampa...

18:36.260 --> 18:37.070
till now.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.580
How does she always know how to get to me?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.260
Grampa Simpson's movements are tentative, 

18:53.640 --> 18:55.190
as if he is distracted.

18:55.370 --> 18:57.530
Distracted as if by a moral dilemma.

18:57.660 --> 19:01.300
A moral dilemma posed by a 
young boy... no, a girl.

19:01.490 --> 19:02.570
A girl named Linda.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.090
No, Lisa.

19:04.330 --> 19:06.050
The flutter of the cape tells all.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.150
Hurry up and kill it!

19:13.250 --> 19:15.270
I have to be at the opera by 7:00!

19:16.220 --> 19:17.660
Yeah, come on! Kill him!

19:34.290 --> 19:36.530
I don't get what he's doing, and I'm smart.

19:36.730 --> 19:40.870
Not book smart or street smart 
or brain smart, but something.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.650
He has released the bulls from the stadium!

19:52.800 --> 19:54.500
Thank god I am up high.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.370
Please, no.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.370
I have a wife and three girlfriends.

20:06.450 --> 20:08.420
Grampa must have set them free.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.840
Ol' Gil's back on track.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.300
He's got a new job and a new red suit.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.790
If you let me go, I give you free large 

20:32.790 --> 20:34.820
pizza pie with purchase of same.

20:34.970 --> 20:36.840
Offer not good tuesday through sunday.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.220
We're closed on monday.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.560
Ah, ah, Santa Maria!

20:45.360 --> 20:47.300
Thanks for setting me straight, sweetie.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.790
Denada, grampa.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It sure is peaceful up here.

21:04.970 --> 21:08.000
I would like to name the following friends 
of mine as members of the communist party.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.100
You're just here to test the microphone.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.950
Fred Wilson, my brother Bill, 
Dom Dimaggio, the paper boy,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Howdy Doody, Josef Stalin...
