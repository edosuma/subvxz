I really like about this blade:

36:31.982 --> 36:33.607
the weight is very nice,

36:33.650 --> 36:36.151
and the balance
is very well done.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.404
This big lip
in the handle, though,

36:39.448 --> 36:43.116
is really not very comfortable
on the hand.

Well done.

So next up, gentlemen,

I'll give you to Doug.

kill the enemy.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.092
But in the cuts that it did do,

38:24.136 --> 38:27.554
the weight did penetrate,
broke some bones.

38:27.597 --> 38:31.433
It penetrated on a deep
thrust coming out,

38:31.476 --> 38:34.185

a very lethal wound,

38:34.229 --> 38:37.314

So to test the strength
