WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.827
The Republic of Florence...
is excommunicated.

00:02.828 --> 00:05.207
Neither the Pope
or King Ferrante

00:05.208 --> 00:07.576
will receive any diplomatic
envoy from Florence.

00:07.644 --> 00:09.145
But they will receive me.

00:09.212 --> 00:11.347
I would have spared Amelia
if I could.

00:11.415 --> 00:14.684
Don't you dare speak
her name! Don't you dare!

00:14.751 --> 00:18.254
I've got no ship, no astrolabe,
no map that explains it all

00:18.322 --> 00:20.189
and Nico - he's with Riario.

00:20.257 --> 00:23.392
If you think I'll help you find the
Vault of Heaven, I'd die first!

00:23.460 --> 00:25.561
There must be a way
to follow Riario and Nico.

00:25.629 --> 00:27.196
<i>Your only hope</i>
<i>is the Sentinel.</i>

00:27.264 --> 00:31.500
And the chaos of slave rebellion
would help us seize command.

00:31.568 --> 00:34.036
I'm drawn to recall
that day from our youth

00:34.104 --> 00:37.473
when you held me beneath
the icy waters...

00:37.541 --> 00:39.175
The Pope holds a prisoner.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.744
A man about whom
you care deeply.

00:41.812 --> 00:45.781
What are you?
The one true hope.

02:25.648 --> 02:27.049
Mm.

02:27.117 --> 02:29.418
Forgive me, Lord.

02:29.486 --> 02:32.488
When he took the throne,
my faith did not waver.

02:32.555 --> 02:35.357
For who was I to judge
the Hand of God on Earth?

02:35.425 --> 02:37.893
But now I know
who he truly is,

02:37.961 --> 02:40.462
here I am sneaking into
the Holy Temple

02:40.530 --> 02:42.564
like a common thief.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.568
Stay here.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.040
While the guards change,

02:52.108 --> 02:54.910
there is a back entrance that
remains briefly unwatched.

02:54.978 --> 02:57.479
We'll have a window of
three minutes - no longer -

02:57.547 --> 02:59.248
where I can secure
your passage

02:59.315 --> 03:01.283
and take you to where
they keep your father.

03:01.351 --> 03:02.885
You must follow
my every command,

03:02.952 --> 03:04.453
so as not to
arouse suspicion

03:04.521 --> 03:07.689
and under no circumstance can
this slant-eyed brute come along.

03:07.757 --> 03:11.360
This..."brute" has been
sworn to protect me.

03:11.428 --> 03:13.962
And if we are discovered
within Vatican walls,

03:14.030 --> 03:17.032
how do you propose we explain
away a face like his?

03:21.504 --> 03:22.805
It's fine.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.686
We must be very careful.

03:39.522 --> 03:42.424
This man...

03:42.492 --> 03:44.293
..the things he's capable of.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.895
No-one knows that
better than I.

03:49.432 --> 03:52.534
The story of Jacob
and Esau,

03:52.602 --> 03:54.870
the Biblical tale
of two brothers who fought

03:54.938 --> 03:55.871
even in their
mother's womb.

03:55.939 --> 03:57.539
I assume you know it.

03:57.607 --> 03:59.875
Of course.

03:59.943 --> 04:02.544
Then let me tell
you another.

04:02.612 --> 04:06.348
<i>My uncle was convinced</i>
<i>that if he had been the first born,</i>

04:06.416 --> 04:09.618
<i>he would have led</i>
<i>a different life.</i>

04:09.686 --> 04:11.053
<i>A better one.</i>

04:14.958 --> 04:18.192
<i>So at a young age,</i>
<i>he tried to rectify the situation.</i>

04:34.811 --> 04:40.582
<i>He'd even prepared an alibi,</i>
<i>a lie to tell their mother.</i>

04:46.422 --> 04:51.059
<i>But God, in His infinite</i>
<i>mercy, intervened.</i>

04:53.463 --> 04:58.233
<i>We're here today because</i>
<i>of the oldest of rivalries.</i>

04:58.301 --> 05:03.138
<i>Because my uncle blames my father</i>
<i>for the fire that burns inside him.</i>

05:06.976 --> 05:11.480
Before I die,
I will see that fire put out.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.222
This is it.
We must hurry.

05:54.023 --> 05:56.792
Leo.
Leo.

05:56.859 --> 06:00.062
Leo.

06:04.734 --> 06:07.336
In case you've lost count,
this is, what,

06:07.403 --> 06:09.871
the tenth night you've
spent out here.

06:09.939 --> 06:11.473
I'm trying to concentrate.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.309
Everybody on the ship's convinced
you're an undead night-walker.

06:14.377 --> 06:16.411
No thanks to you!
We had to say something.

06:16.479 --> 06:18.513
He hasn't slept
in centuries.

06:18.581 --> 06:22.317
Please go away!
Christ in Heaven, you've been busy.

06:22.385 --> 06:24.419
Is that the Jew's map?

06:24.487 --> 06:26.455
Abyssinian's skin.
Don't touch.

06:26.522 --> 06:29.691
I recreated them from memory.

06:29.759 --> 06:33.328
But that was just
the beginning, Zo.

06:33.396 --> 06:36.932
I'm... I'm charting
luminous bodies that we

06:37.000 --> 06:39.534
didn't even know existed.

06:39.602 --> 06:43.305
And Toscanelli's maps...
are piss poor in comparison.

06:43.373 --> 06:46.541
"Piss poor"? He's the finest
cosmographer in the world.

06:46.609 --> 06:49.678
And he's recorded the stars he's
seen with such attention to detail

06:49.746 --> 06:52.881
that I will forgive
his hideous sense of anatomy.

06:52.949 --> 06:56.451
But the heavens are bigger
than he knows.

06:56.519 --> 06:58.587
Our speed?
11 knots, sir.

06:58.655 --> 06:59.955
11 knots...

07:01.958 --> 07:04.760
Are we on the right course?
We've been at sea for weeks.

07:04.827 --> 07:08.263
Toscanelli also recorded...

07:08.331 --> 07:10.766
..the trajectory of Venus.
Do you see?

07:10.833 --> 07:12.968
So that,
together with this device,

07:13.036 --> 07:16.605
has enabled me to estimate
the length of our voyage.

07:16.673 --> 07:19.241
Are you aware we're half way
through provisions?

07:19.308 --> 07:22.210
Leo.

07:22.278 --> 07:23.545
Hello.
What? What?

07:23.613 --> 07:26.715
I say, provisions. Half way
through. Aware? At all?

07:26.783 --> 07:29.451
We'll be fine.
You're wrong. We'll die.

07:29.519 --> 07:32.554
No-one's going to die.
I just need to track our path

07:32.622 --> 07:36.291
and to do that,
I need a bit more time.

07:36.359 --> 07:38.193
I fear time
is running short.

07:39.796 --> 07:41.363
There's something
you should see.

07:46.736 --> 07:49.004
Alright...
<i>Leave it.</i>

08:04.320 --> 08:08.457
We agreed
this would be bloodless.

08:08.524 --> 08:10.325
We must be quick.

08:20.937 --> 08:23.538
Been at it all night.
They're pretty spooked.

08:42.457 --> 08:46.361
Looks like our new crew aren't as eager
to reach the virgin lands as you.

08:46.429 --> 08:50.098
Circassians are an ignorant,
superstitious lot.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.201
They probably fear we're sailing
over the end of the world.

08:53.269 --> 08:55.137
But they agreed
to the voyage.

08:55.204 --> 08:58.206
Easy to do when you're newly
freed, but after weeks at sea...

08:58.274 --> 09:00.375
The Captain
suspects mutiny.

09:00.443 --> 09:02.611
Some knives are gone
from the galley.

09:02.678 --> 09:05.514
We can get the order?
Just kill the mutinous dogs.

09:05.581 --> 09:08.283
Don't we need
their help?

09:08.351 --> 09:12.521
I can explain it to them.
Explain what?

09:12.588 --> 09:15.056
I can show them
that the world is round.

09:15.124 --> 09:18.927
I can teach them.
You don't teach their sort,

09:18.995 --> 09:21.429
except with the
biggest club you have.

09:21.497 --> 09:24.332
Stay above decks.
We'll handle it.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.002
One chance.

09:27.069 --> 09:28.069
Please.

09:57.533 --> 09:58.733
Amen.

10:00.670 --> 10:03.939
I haven't seen you
do that in days.

10:04.006 --> 10:07.008
The further we travel
from our gods,

10:07.076 --> 10:09.344
the harder it becomes
to pay them tribute.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.316
It makes tribute
all the more meaningful.

10:16.419 --> 10:19.187
And when you
pay tribute...

10:19.255 --> 10:23.325
..is it to your God
or your father?

10:23.392 --> 10:27.329
I used to believe
they were one and the same.

10:27.396 --> 10:28.830
And now?

10:34.003 --> 10:35.537
There is goodness
in you.

10:37.607 --> 10:39.608
There is piety.

10:41.043 --> 10:43.044
There is grace.
No.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.116
No-one looks on me
and sees grace.

10:48.184 --> 10:49.384
I do.

10:58.194 --> 11:00.362
May I ask...

11:00.429 --> 11:02.898
what are you teaching
the boy?

11:02.965 --> 11:05.133
What I know best.

11:05.201 --> 11:08.069
How to survive
when grace fails.

11:11.140 --> 11:14.142
Oh, would it
pain us greatly

11:14.210 --> 11:16.344
to take
just one main road?

11:16.412 --> 11:18.246
Perhaps one that won't
leave our buttocks

11:18.314 --> 11:20.048
such a ripe shade
of purple?

11:20.116 --> 11:22.150
We're almost there, Piero.

11:22.218 --> 11:24.552
Just a few miles before
the border of Naples.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.855
Good.

11:26.923 --> 11:29.424
There are checking points
along the main road.

11:29.492 --> 11:33.361
If we must ride through the Papal
States, it's best we do so quietly.

11:33.429 --> 11:35.030
There is still
a version of events

11:35.097 --> 11:37.332
where you remedy
this situation from Florence,

11:37.400 --> 11:40.502
where you persuade King Ferrante
to break his alliance with Sixtus

11:40.569 --> 11:43.204
from the comfort and
protection of your own home.

11:43.272 --> 11:45.040
Florence is excommunicated.

11:45.107 --> 11:48.076
No Italian states
will trade with us.

11:48.144 --> 11:50.011
In two months,
we lose the bank.

11:50.079 --> 11:51.579
In three months,
we lose the people.

11:51.614 --> 11:53.654
By the fourth, there'll be
nothing between our necks

11:53.716 --> 11:55.216
and Rome's blades.

11:55.384 --> 11:59.454
It may not be pleasant
but we have no other option.

11:59.522 --> 12:01.222
Perhaps the day
you run an Italian state,

12:01.290 --> 12:03.091
you can do it differently.

12:24.547 --> 12:25.847
Where is he?

12:43.099 --> 12:45.733
Father?

13:04.954 --> 13:07.188
My child.

13:08.457 --> 13:10.525
Look at you.

13:22.404 --> 13:24.973
Do you know who I am, Amelia?

13:25.040 --> 13:28.309
I think so,
Your Holiness.

13:28.377 --> 13:30.478
Are you the Pope?

13:30.546 --> 13:32.580
Newly anointed.

13:32.648 --> 13:35.083
But today I come here...

13:35.151 --> 13:38.586
not as the Pope.

13:38.654 --> 13:42.223
Today I come...

13:42.291 --> 13:45.193
..as your father.

13:45.261 --> 13:47.629
What have they done to you?

13:47.696 --> 13:50.365
A temporary hardship.

13:50.432 --> 13:54.569
How can they keep you here?

13:54.637 --> 13:59.073
A man came through here.
A friend of mine.

13:59.141 --> 14:02.944
He offered you freedom.
Da Vinci.

14:03.012 --> 14:05.213
He made quite an entrance.

14:05.281 --> 14:08.149
Why did you stay?

14:08.217 --> 14:10.351
I had to.

14:10.419 --> 14:13.988
But if you'd escaped and we
revealed who you truly are,

14:14.056 --> 14:16.558
we could right
these wrongs.

14:16.625 --> 14:22.263
The most obvious move
is rarely the cleverest.

14:23.399 --> 14:25.066
What are you talking about?

14:25.134 --> 14:29.037
Strategy...my child.

14:29.104 --> 14:31.072
Have they driven you mad?

14:31.140 --> 14:32.974
Just the opposite.

14:33.042 --> 14:36.177
Please, Father, we have to
get you out of here.

14:36.245 --> 14:39.113
Not yet, Lucrezia.
No more strategies.

14:39.181 --> 14:41.883
No more elliptical messages.

14:41.951 --> 14:45.186
Taking the throne
will not be as easy for me...

14:45.254 --> 14:48.122
as it was for my brother.

14:50.192 --> 14:52.994
Though in the end...

14:53.062 --> 14:56.931
..it may be as brutal.

14:56.999 --> 15:02.270
Once I joined the Church,
I acquired enemies.

15:02.338 --> 15:06.007
So you and your sister
were sent to be raised here,

15:06.075 --> 15:10.478
with the Donati family guarding
our secret, for your safety.

15:10.546 --> 15:15.049
But in my absence, I can see that
your sister has done a fine job.

15:15.117 --> 15:17.318
Better than I could
ever have hoped.

15:23.325 --> 15:26.194
No-one should know
we're here.

15:29.598 --> 15:33.334
Secure the front door.
You, guard the rear.

15:33.402 --> 15:35.870
Father?
It's nothing, my sweet.

15:35.938 --> 15:38.039
Aargh!

15:41.010 --> 15:42.710
Take her to safety.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.843
All clear.

16:00.911 --> 16:02.778
Bring him in.

16:18.595 --> 16:22.264
I knew your sentimentality
would betray you, brother.

16:22.332 --> 16:25.534
How long have I waited
in the shadows...

16:25.602 --> 16:28.571
for the right moment
of weakness?

16:28.638 --> 16:31.106
God have mercy on your soul.

16:36.379 --> 16:39.548
Then make me a full partner
in your plan.

16:42.352 --> 16:46.455
Until I know that this
will be over soon...

16:49.826 --> 16:53.862
..I don't have the strength
to follow you further.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.612
I need this finished.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.688
Lupo?

17:22.459 --> 17:26.127
As an old friend, I thank
you for the...reunion

17:26.195 --> 17:28.564
that you have granted me.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.200
Of course.
Please...

17:31.267 --> 17:33.469
leave us.

17:34.838 --> 17:37.740
The information I'm about
to impart to my daughter

17:37.807 --> 17:42.211
would compromise you beyond
the comfort of deniability.

17:42.278 --> 17:46.782
Even if we fail, old friend,
save yourself.

17:46.850 --> 17:50.753
I may take issue with
the imposter who leads it,

17:50.820 --> 17:55.491
but I cannot leave you to conspire
against the Holy Roman Church.

17:55.558 --> 17:58.894
I am the Holy Roman Church!

18:00.697 --> 18:05.100
I always thought to blame
the physic for pulling you out first.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.536
How could our mother
not favor you?

18:07.604 --> 18:11.106
She held you
before she held me.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.175
This is madness.

18:13.243 --> 18:17.279
In the spirit of righting wrongs,
I tracked that physic down.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.381
He apologized...

18:19.449 --> 18:21.450
and then I killed him -

18:21.518 --> 18:23.786
with a vaginal speculum.

18:26.489 --> 18:28.357
None of this was his fault
in the end.

18:28.425 --> 18:34.163
No. It was yours.

18:34.230 --> 18:39.301
I shall assume
the Papal throne at once.

18:39.369 --> 18:43.338
Since you've always kept
my existence a secret,

18:43.406 --> 18:46.442
I will raise no suspicions.

18:46.509 --> 18:49.311
Have the decency
to spare my daughters...

18:49.379 --> 18:51.647
from witnessing this.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.282
Witnessing what, brother?

18:53.349 --> 18:56.385
I've no more interest
in killing you.

18:56.453 --> 18:59.822
We both know
God won't allow it.

19:04.794 --> 19:07.062
Dispose of them at once.
No!

19:07.130 --> 19:08.797
Father...

19:08.865 --> 19:13.836
The horrors you and I
have endured...

19:13.903 --> 19:17.806
..cannot be in vain.

19:17.874 --> 19:20.109
Have faith...

19:20.176 --> 19:23.645
that every painful moment...

19:23.713 --> 19:27.750
..is part of God's plan.

19:27.817 --> 19:30.986
You speak of the horrors
that I have endured?

19:33.323 --> 19:36.358
What of the ones
that I have committed?

19:36.426 --> 19:40.429
You must have faith,
my child.

19:48.171 --> 19:52.941
<i>Haul away!</i>
<i>Haul away!</i>

20:08.291 --> 20:12.728
I find myself compelled
to show you some grace.

20:12.796 --> 20:16.565
I'm somewhat skeptical
you will appreciate it but...

20:16.633 --> 20:17.800
I brought you this.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.369
One applies charcoal
to paper

20:20.436 --> 20:22.104
to produce a drawing.

20:24.507 --> 20:27.543
I'm not an artist.
And yet you follow one.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.816
The Turk said
there would be a storm.

20:33.883 --> 20:37.753
This ship will sink
without Da Vinci at the helm.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.589
How intriguing
that even out here...

20:40.657 --> 20:43.959
..you allow your Maestro
to control you.

20:46.229 --> 20:48.697
You're the first-born son
of a lawyer.

20:48.765 --> 20:50.699
You were taught grammar,
rhetoric,

20:50.767 --> 20:54.503
came close to completing
a course in Latin...

20:54.571 --> 20:57.439
..but you left that home
to follow an artist

20:57.507 --> 21:01.777
even though, as you say, you
have no creative aspirations.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.047
Curious.

21:05.114 --> 21:08.550
You are the bastard son
of a hateful Pope.

21:08.618 --> 21:10.419
You're bedding
a slave girl.

21:10.486 --> 21:14.256
You went against Vatican
orders, risking execution,

21:14.324 --> 21:16.592
to get your hands on
the Book of Leaves.

21:16.659 --> 21:19.528
All because it will give you
the same knowledge and power

21:19.596 --> 21:22.631
that my Maestro
was born with.

21:23.266 --> 21:24.700
Curious.

21:26.836 --> 21:29.471
It's actually simple.

21:29.539 --> 21:33.008
But like most revelations,
this one has eluded us for centuries

21:33.076 --> 21:36.078
because of its simplicity.

21:36.145 --> 21:39.281
This...here...

21:39.349 --> 21:40.749
..is a map of the stars.

21:40.817 --> 21:42.451
But it's not a map
of all the stars.

21:42.518 --> 21:46.221
It's just a map
of the stars we know.

21:46.289 --> 21:49.057
Since because the earth
is round,

21:49.125 --> 21:51.627
there are certain parts
of the night sky

21:51.694 --> 21:54.596
that we're yet to lay
our eyes upon.

21:54.664 --> 21:57.933
But we're doing that
right now.

21:58.001 --> 22:00.402
On this very voyage.

22:00.470 --> 22:03.505
Look. Do you see?

22:25.695 --> 22:29.665
He says we should have gotten off
with the others at Cape Verde.

22:29.732 --> 22:32.267
He cannot allow you to send
us off the end of the earth.

22:32.335 --> 22:35.103
You have nothing to fear.
So we were told.

22:35.171 --> 22:38.640
Before the chains,
before the whips.

22:38.708 --> 22:42.377
Now all we know is fear.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.618
Give me that.

22:51.254 --> 22:53.188
Look.

22:53.256 --> 22:55.324
Put your head here.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.230
Perfect.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.199
Now...

23:04.267 --> 23:09.204
there's a mountain
in the distance.

23:09.272 --> 23:12.507
Which part do you see first?

23:12.575 --> 23:15.177
What?
If the world was flat...

23:15.244 --> 23:20.349
like this table...
you'd see all of it at once, wouldn't you?

23:20.416 --> 23:21.650
Yes.
However...

23:21.718 --> 23:23.352
the mountain
in the distance...

23:23.419 --> 23:27.823
Which part do you see first?

23:31.294 --> 23:33.395
The top.

23:48.144 --> 23:52.080
He says this ship strays too far from
where our ancestors died.

23:52.148 --> 23:54.249
Our loved ones.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.588
It's a globe.

23:59.655 --> 24:04.159
Every step you're taking
away from home...

24:04.227 --> 24:07.195
..you're actually going back.

24:07.263 --> 24:10.532
See?

24:26.416 --> 24:29.418
This device...

24:29.485 --> 24:34.156
This enables me
to study the night sky.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.492
These are lenses.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.662
They bring images closer.
Right. Good.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.266
Now, this is Venus.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.935
Venus circles the earth

24:47.003 --> 24:51.106
and makes appearances
in crescent shapes, like the moon.

24:51.174 --> 24:54.543
Now, this shape - the left
side crescent of Venus -

24:54.610 --> 24:58.046
will appear tonight, proving that
I can read the stars correctly.

24:58.114 --> 25:00.482
Proof that we're headed
in the right direction.

25:00.550 --> 25:04.653
Proof that we will not
die at sea.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.455
Now...

25:06.522 --> 25:08.890
in order for that to happen,

25:08.958 --> 25:12.994
I need four hours...
and your trust.

25:19.302 --> 25:22.070
We will give you four hours.

25:22.138 --> 25:24.673
But do not underestimate us.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.374
We are willing to die here,

25:26.442 --> 25:29.811
before we let our souls
disappear into the unknown.

25:33.416 --> 25:36.251
<i>In times as turbulent</i>
<i>as these,</i>

25:36.319 --> 25:39.521
<i>times of sin and temptation,</i>

25:39.589 --> 25:42.958
times of tempestuous
political unrest,

25:43.025 --> 25:47.295
who will guarantee your safety
from the horrors of Hell?

25:47.363 --> 25:51.099
From the sharp, recalescent sabers
of Lucifer himself?

25:51.167 --> 25:56.071
Who else
but the Holy Roman Church?

25:56.139 --> 25:58.607
What's more,
today and today only,

25:58.674 --> 26:03.578
I am qualified to release
your loved ones

26:03.646 --> 26:04.746
from eternal torment.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.314
And that's two
for the price of one.

26:06.382 --> 26:09.417
As soon as the gold
in the casket rings,

26:09.485 --> 26:12.053
the rescued soul
to heaven springs.

26:12.121 --> 26:14.222
Let's be having you.
Come on, brothers.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.324
Their gullibility
astounds me.

26:16.392 --> 26:18.026
Let it astound you quietly

26:18.094 --> 26:20.862
and let's use this distraction to
move along before they notice.

26:20.930 --> 26:22.597
You there! Weary travelers.

26:22.665 --> 26:26.902
Surely your mortal souls are not above
Church-sanctioned repentance.

26:26.969 --> 26:30.438
Well, we are more devout
than most, thank you.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.347
You fancy yourselves
Godly men? All the better.

26:32.375 --> 26:36.344
The Holy Father has licensed
me to grant pardons

26:36.412 --> 26:37.846
for sins not yet committed.

26:37.914 --> 26:39.181
Move.

26:40.716 --> 26:45.187
We never know what our bodies
might fancy down the road.

26:45.254 --> 26:49.624
Prearrange your salvation
while you can, brothers!

26:49.692 --> 26:51.092
Before it's too late.

27:04.907 --> 27:08.410
What do you know
about the Book?

27:08.477 --> 27:11.580
His Holiness believes
it was written by the Nephilim,

27:11.647 --> 27:16.117
the offspring
of angels and men.

27:16.185 --> 27:19.521
I find this notion romantic
but um...

27:19.589 --> 27:21.890
..unlikely.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.525
No, I believe
it was transcribed

27:23.593 --> 27:27.796
by the elders of an ancient
civilization in Crete...

27:27.863 --> 27:29.598
9,000 years before Christ,

27:29.665 --> 27:32.867
in a place that later
became the legendary

27:32.935 --> 27:35.604
lost City of Atlantis.

27:35.671 --> 27:38.273
And their descendents,

27:38.341 --> 27:39.941
the Minoans,

27:40.009 --> 27:43.712
brought about the end of their
civilization trying to reclaim it.

27:43.779 --> 27:46.248
And that sounds more likely?

27:53.122 --> 27:54.990
Whoever lays their hands
on the Book of Leaves

27:55.057 --> 27:58.193
will rule all of Italy...

27:58.261 --> 27:59.294
if not the world.

28:02.565 --> 28:05.066
My father doesn't
see this yet,

28:05.134 --> 28:07.535
but Da Vinci does,

28:07.603 --> 28:10.372
as do his precious
Sons of Mithras.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.686
However, the most ancient
of all the agencies

28:14.711 --> 28:15.677
searching for the Book -

28:15.678 --> 28:18.213
and quite possibly
the most powerful -

28:18.281 --> 28:21.916
exists only between whispers
in dark corridors.

28:26.856 --> 28:29.324
During your tutelage,

28:29.392 --> 28:32.093
did Da Vinci ever mention
The Labyrinth?

28:34.530 --> 28:36.331
The what?
<i>Count Riario!</i>

28:36.399 --> 28:37.699
<i>Captain wants you.</i>

28:41.570 --> 28:43.672
What is it?
Storm on the way.

28:43.739 --> 28:46.207
We're not up to it.
Could push us into the rocks.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.945
Told you.
We're all gonna die.

28:54.183 --> 28:57.252
I'm surprised you can stomach
such a peasant's repast.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.554
Reminds me
of my adventurous youth.

28:59.622 --> 29:02.157
I'd rather we eat
from the feedbag.

29:02.224 --> 29:04.626
You've a sense of humor in
there somewhere, don't you?

29:04.694 --> 29:06.194
Much like your son's.

29:06.262 --> 29:09.297
Ah, that's where
our likeness ends.

29:09.365 --> 29:11.966
Well, in the end, Leonardo's
aid was instrumental

29:12.034 --> 29:14.302
in saving my life.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.804
And all of Florence.

29:15.871 --> 29:17.505
I'm grateful for that,
Signor,

29:17.573 --> 29:20.608
but for all the boy's talents, he
leaves only misfortune in his wake.

29:22.244 --> 29:23.845
Had he remained in Florence,

29:23.913 --> 29:26.513
he might have become one
of the most celebrated artists in Europe.

29:26.549 --> 29:28.817
In Christendom.

29:28.884 --> 29:31.820
And Lord knows
where he's off to now.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.688
Indeed.

29:35.558 --> 29:39.461
So, with all the work
he's produced so far...

29:39.528 --> 29:42.330
..there isn't one painting,
one invention,

29:42.398 --> 29:45.767
that fills you with some
shred of pride?

29:45.835 --> 29:48.670
Pride in Leonardo?

29:48.738 --> 29:51.339
I've never even
considered it.

29:51.407 --> 29:53.508
Thieves.

29:53.576 --> 29:56.478
I told you
this was a bad idea.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.614
Who goes there?
Whoa, my good man.

29:59.682 --> 30:01.516
We mean no harm.

30:02.752 --> 30:05.320
No, of course not.
You are men of God.

30:06.822 --> 30:11.126
My associate and I wonder
if you'd lend us your ears.

30:11.193 --> 30:15.063
Well, we are simple merchants, Signor,
and we must be on our way.

30:15.131 --> 30:17.799
Um, prepare the cart, Vero.

30:17.867 --> 30:19.968
A stingy lot indeed.

30:22.138 --> 30:24.572
Second Corinthians,
ninth chapter, tells us,

30:24.640 --> 30:28.376
"Every man according to
as he purposeth in his heart,

30:28.444 --> 30:32.113
so let him give, not
grudgingly or of necessity,

30:32.181 --> 30:34.749
for God loves
a cheerful giver."

30:34.817 --> 30:40.121
"Woe to you, scribes,
Pharisees and hypocrites.

30:40.189 --> 30:42.357
For ye are like
unto whited sepulchers,

30:42.425 --> 30:44.659
which indeed appear
beautiful outward,

30:44.727 --> 30:47.762
but are within
full of dead men's bones,

30:47.830 --> 30:51.199
and of all uncleanness."

30:52.401 --> 30:54.102
Mm.

30:54.170 --> 30:55.270
Matthew?

30:55.337 --> 30:58.606
Maybe.

30:58.674 --> 31:00.375
But I am not the expert.

31:02.645 --> 31:06.414
But you're no merchant,
either.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.786
Quick you were to dismiss
my offer of indulgences.

31:11.854 --> 31:16.391
Surely you must know
some soul in need of a little guidance.

31:16.459 --> 31:20.662
A relative, perhaps, recently
moved on from this world to the next?

31:20.729 --> 31:23.565
A brother?

31:23.632 --> 31:27.669
Lorenzo
Il Magnifico himself.

31:27.736 --> 31:30.171
The First Citizen
of Florence.

31:30.239 --> 31:34.576
An honor to be in your
company, Signor de Medici.

31:34.643 --> 31:39.781
And my condolences on the sad news
of your recent excommunication.

31:39.849 --> 31:42.517
No, Golo. No.

31:42.585 --> 31:45.687
There will be no need
for bloodshed tonight.

31:45.754 --> 31:50.658
For while I am a loyal servant
of the Holy Roman Church,

31:50.726 --> 31:53.228
I'm also a man
much like yourself -

31:53.295 --> 31:56.464
primarily interested
in business.

32:00.703 --> 32:04.472
100 ducats
and be on your way.

32:04.540 --> 32:07.809
100 ducats?

32:07.877 --> 32:11.579
Do you know what will befall you
if I let the nearest town know

32:11.647 --> 32:13.715
that Lorenzo,
the Church's own enemy,

32:13.782 --> 32:16.317
has set foot upon
their countryside?

32:20.689 --> 32:23.625
No doubt you're traveling
on a mission of diplomacy.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.593
Hm?

32:25.661 --> 32:29.531
Perhaps to curry favor
with King Ferrante of Naples?

32:29.598 --> 32:34.402
And we all know how the Medici
approach matters of state.

32:36.205 --> 32:40.375
Golo, how much gold do you think
they've hidden under those barrels?

32:42.678 --> 32:45.446
The rich may travel light,
my friend,

32:45.514 --> 32:48.716
but they never travel poor.

32:50.319 --> 32:52.387
I agreed to let you see him,
that's all.

32:52.454 --> 32:55.189
I never agreed to this.
It won't take long.

32:55.257 --> 32:57.058
I give you my word.

32:57.126 --> 33:00.295
And what good is your word
when I'm burnt for heresy?

33:06.502 --> 33:08.570
Here it is.

33:08.637 --> 33:10.171
Study it quickly.

33:13.609 --> 33:17.445
<i>The Sword of Osman Gazi.</i>

33:17.513 --> 33:20.281
<i>Gallant leader of the Turks.</i>

33:20.349 --> 33:23.985
Founder of
the Ottoman Empire.

33:26.121 --> 33:28.222
In Constantinople,

33:28.290 --> 33:30.358
they mislead their people

33:30.426 --> 33:34.596
by proudly displaying
a counterfeit sword in their palace.

33:34.663 --> 33:39.300
This is the original.

33:39.368 --> 33:41.402
I've studied it at length.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.071
It's a humble weapon.

33:43.138 --> 33:47.542
If there is a coded message
in these glyphs,

33:47.610 --> 33:49.310
I cannot decipher it.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.349
I am not here to decipher it,
Cardinal.

33:54.416 --> 33:57.118
What?
I'm taking it with me.

33:57.186 --> 33:59.187
Nothing leaves
these archives.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.155
What if he notices
the sword's absence?

34:01.223 --> 34:04.425
It is a vital part
of my father's strategy.

34:04.493 --> 34:07.261
Don't push me further.

34:09.665 --> 34:13.467
It would be a blessing
to end your sinful life here.

34:19.742 --> 34:24.078
Now you know why my father
is behind bars,

34:24.146 --> 34:28.983
do what is required
to release him.

34:29.051 --> 34:32.754
You must serve God's will.

34:32.821 --> 34:37.525
I grow weary of interpreting
God's will.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.030
Too often it leads to death.

34:42.097 --> 34:46.668
Let it lead to
the imposter's, not yours.

34:47.569 --> 34:50.405
Cardinal.

34:50.472 --> 34:52.507
I heard voices.

34:52.964 --> 34:54.931
Why is the harlot here?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.068
Stand aside.

35:02.707 --> 35:05.810
Let's see what His Holiness
might have in mind for you.

35:05.877 --> 35:07.845
Declare yourself now!

35:07.913 --> 35:09.980
Argh!

35:10.048 --> 35:14.018
Cardinal. Who do you serve?

35:15.854 --> 35:17.855
Captain, take her away!

35:17.923 --> 35:19.523
This way, harlot.

35:22.861 --> 35:24.128
Argh! Oh!

35:33.905 --> 35:35.506
I will dispose of him.

35:35.574 --> 35:39.643
But you...you need to run.

35:46.751 --> 35:48.752
Open it.
Let me feast my eyes.

35:48.820 --> 35:51.522
Leave us enough
to get home safely with.

35:51.590 --> 35:53.757
Open it.

36:14.946 --> 36:17.381
Hm.

37:04.963 --> 37:08.832
Oh, please, Signor.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.467
Show some mercy.

37:25.550 --> 37:29.820
Remember, when Venus rises,
you will see a crescent on its left side.

37:29.888 --> 37:32.156
Yes. I will see this shape.

37:32.224 --> 37:34.592
Precisely.

37:34.659 --> 37:37.461
And when Venus appears,
peacefully orbiting the earth,

37:37.529 --> 37:40.831
you can tell your people
I know what I'm doing...

37:40.899 --> 37:43.801
..we're headed
in the right direction,

37:43.868 --> 37:48.405
and that I can lead us all
to a land filled with opportunity.

37:53.545 --> 37:55.446
Don't suppose anyone's
got any jokes?

38:00.719 --> 38:02.786
Follow these instructions
precisely.

38:02.854 --> 38:05.155
I've plotted every turn
our course must take.

38:05.223 --> 38:08.158
Here he comes.

38:12.764 --> 38:16.000
No, just...straight ahead
and up ever so slightly.

38:16.067 --> 38:19.336
That's it. That's it.

38:27.012 --> 38:28.178
What?

38:36.755 --> 38:40.357
It's right-sided?
It's the wrong phase.

38:50.135 --> 38:51.702
No, no, no.

39:02.547 --> 39:04.948
Leo!

39:05.016 --> 39:07.051
Shit, you're a feisty one.

39:12.557 --> 39:14.658
Stop!

39:22.734 --> 39:23.834
I gave you one job.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.841
Listen...

39:39.784 --> 39:41.218
Aargh!

39:46.591 --> 39:48.592
All hands below deck!

39:57.702 --> 40:00.437
Take them on deck.

40:00.505 --> 40:02.539
We'll toss every
last bastard overboard.

40:02.607 --> 40:03.847
What?

40:03.872 --> 40:05.872
You do not coddle
mutineers. You kill them!

40:06.010 --> 40:09.480
When we get to new land...
When men turn on you at sea,

40:09.547 --> 40:11.382
you can't keep them on board.

40:11.449 --> 40:15.419
There's no arguing it.
Get rid of them.

40:15.487 --> 40:19.757
No, wait. Wait. Wait.

40:19.824 --> 40:21.725
What if we kept them
in chains?

40:21.793 --> 40:24.628
What did you just say?
You've seen their strength.

40:24.696 --> 40:27.998
Who better to lug our spoils
back to the ship

40:28.066 --> 40:30.000
when we make landfall?

40:36.040 --> 40:39.810
Come on.

40:39.878 --> 40:41.712
Put them in the hold.

40:41.780 --> 40:44.782
Tighten their bonds
to their skins.

40:44.849 --> 40:47.217
I'll talk to the Captain.

40:56.861 --> 40:58.929
That'll do, Piero.

40:58.997 --> 41:02.332
They don't deserve
a better grave.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.701
We are not that far
from Naples.

41:04.769 --> 41:08.439
By tomorrow I shall buy you
a glass of the finest wine.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.142
Florence asks much of us.

41:14.846 --> 41:16.847
It must stand...

41:16.915 --> 41:21.351
as a city destined to lead
the world into a new age.

41:21.419 --> 41:24.588
No matter the cost.

41:24.656 --> 41:28.025
That's what my grandfather,
Cosmo, believed.

41:28.092 --> 41:31.628
And so too, in his own way,
did my brother.

41:31.696 --> 41:35.332
Giuliano would have made
a better partner for this adventure.

41:37.168 --> 41:40.103
You're doing fine, Piero.

41:45.510 --> 41:49.379
The boy's work. You asked
if I had a favorite.

41:49.447 --> 41:51.081
When he first followed me
to Florence,

41:51.149 --> 41:54.318
when he was still
but an apprentice,

41:54.385 --> 41:59.423
he left a parcel
on my doorstep with a note.

41:59.491 --> 42:04.094
They had just progressed
from charcoals to oil paints.

42:04.162 --> 42:06.430
He was so excited.

42:06.498 --> 42:11.001
Verrochio had taken him
aside, told him he showed great promise.

42:11.069 --> 42:15.939
Leonardo wanted me
to have his first canvas.

42:16.007 --> 42:18.642
Small. Simple.

42:18.710 --> 42:20.577
A bowl of fruit.

42:20.645 --> 42:24.381
It doesn't matter how small it is,
I'm sure it's marvelous.

42:24.449 --> 42:25.916
I threw it away.

42:32.457 --> 42:36.159
Of all the work he's produced, that's
the one I'll not forget.

42:37.495 --> 42:40.764
That he's a genius,
I have no doubt.

42:40.832 --> 42:45.769
But my relationship with the boy -
with his mother -

42:45.837 --> 42:48.805
will always be complicated.

42:48.873 --> 42:52.776
I didn't want to have
feelings for her.

42:52.844 --> 42:55.612
I couldn't help myself.

42:55.680 --> 42:59.016
She was extraordinary.

43:02.654 --> 43:06.390
Then one morning I awoke
and it was just me...

43:08.459 --> 43:10.427
..and the boy.

43:10.895 --> 43:12.529
Who the fuck are you?

43:12.596 --> 43:15.532
After all they've been through,
you put them back in chains.

43:15.599 --> 43:18.168
It was either put them in chains or
throw them overboard.

43:18.235 --> 43:21.204
What was I supposed to do?
All your talk about freedom was what?

43:21.272 --> 43:24.374
They tried to kill me!
They thought you were trying to kill them!

43:24.442 --> 43:26.576
I think that at least
once a day in your company.

43:26.644 --> 43:28.712
Look, this journey...

43:28.779 --> 43:30.747
it's been difficult enough
without superstitions

43:30.815 --> 43:32.949
ruining
it when we are this close.

43:33.017 --> 43:35.752
This coming from a man
following the Book of Leaves?

43:35.820 --> 43:38.521
The Book of Leaves is real.
Says the Turk, Leo!

43:38.589 --> 43:40.190
You've seen these maps.

43:40.257 --> 43:44.160
Do you know how many maps
I've sold that lead to buried treasure?

43:44.228 --> 43:46.296
I mean,
have you stopped to think

43:46.364 --> 43:51.167
at your land across the sea
is as much a fantasy as their afterlife?

43:51.235 --> 43:54.170
What if you do kill us
out here?

43:56.974 --> 43:58.295
You said that you would
follow me.

43:58.342 --> 44:04.114
The man I follow
is an artist.

44:04.181 --> 44:09.252
He's a virtuous genius
who wants to free the future.

44:11.389 --> 44:15.258
Right now, I think we
left him back in Florence.

44:35.813 --> 44:39.282
You know, I understand...

44:39.350 --> 44:44.087
..why they don't trust me.

44:44.155 --> 44:45.989
But you should.

44:46.057 --> 44:48.191
<i>Because you're</i>
<i>a great artist?</i>

44:48.259 --> 44:50.894
<i>Because you have this way</i>
<i>with inventions?</i>

44:50.961 --> 44:54.130
<i>It counts for shit, Leo...</i>

44:54.198 --> 44:59.502
..when you start putting
people...in chains.

45:01.439 --> 45:04.674
Nobody ever knows better
than you, do they?

45:04.742 --> 45:09.212
But you can't get mad, Leo, when the
stars don't move as quick as you do.

45:19.924 --> 45:22.158
Fuck me.

45:24.128 --> 45:26.463
The orbits.

45:28.365 --> 45:32.001
The speed of them.

45:32.069 --> 45:36.706
That's the answer.
We're not heading in the wrong direction.

45:36.774 --> 45:40.110
The crescent of Venus was
different because Venus...

45:40.177 --> 45:42.912
it doesn't circle the earth.

45:42.980 --> 45:46.349
None of it does.

45:46.417 --> 45:49.252
It all moves around the sun.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.021
Oh, shit!
What?

45:52.089 --> 45:56.226
We've been trying to navigate the world
as if it's a fixed point.

45:56.293 --> 45:59.762
As if the sun and stars
are circling us, but...

45:59.830 --> 46:02.866
but they're not!

46:22.953 --> 46:25.655
Now I see it.

46:27.725 --> 46:30.693
And now I can more accurately
calculate our position

46:30.761 --> 46:33.997
using the celestial bodies
all around us...

46:34.064 --> 46:38.368
..as they move...

46:38.435 --> 46:42.205
..and as we move with them...

46:42.273 --> 46:44.641
Oh...

46:44.708 --> 46:47.577
..on our path
through the heavens.

46:51.248 --> 46:55.818
Shall I get the Captain?
No.

46:55.886 --> 46:58.955
First...

46:59.023 --> 47:01.624
..let's free them
from the chains.

47:11.001 --> 47:13.403
Let's show them
some reason.

47:19.777 --> 47:20.944
Ahh!

47:24.848 --> 47:26.916
<i>Over here!</i>

47:26.984 --> 47:29.485
Tell me I'm hearing things.

47:30.854 --> 47:34.457
Lorenzo, the armor.
These men are border guards.

47:35.426 --> 47:37.760
Welcome to Naples.

47:51.742 --> 47:53.710
Where's the guard?

48:01.552 --> 48:02.652
Shit.

48:33.784 --> 48:36.386
Look at the wounds.
They did this to themselves.

48:41.959 --> 48:44.193
Hey.

48:44.261 --> 48:45.632
Are you harmed?

48:45.657 --> 48:47.934
We each agreed
to take the life of another...

48:49.166 --> 48:53.403
..before you made our souls
disappear into nothing.

48:53.470 --> 48:59.375
Mihail and I, we...
we were the last.

48:59.443 --> 49:02.378
But...he had a wife once.

49:02.446 --> 49:05.782
He... He had a daughter.

49:05.849 --> 49:10.053
I sent him to them first.

49:13.023 --> 49:15.992
Please.
Here.

49:17.094 --> 49:19.195
We're gonna get you out.

49:26.970 --> 49:28.638
Zo, wait!

49:30.240 --> 49:33.343
What are you doing?

49:33.410 --> 49:36.179
Take my life or I take his.

49:36.246 --> 49:38.181
Don't you dare do it, Leo.

49:38.248 --> 49:41.951
You... You said we'd go home.

49:42.019 --> 49:44.153
We will.

49:44.221 --> 49:46.656
We are.

49:48.292 --> 49:50.893
You just...

49:50.961 --> 49:54.797
You have to listen to me.

49:54.865 --> 49:57.567
Not only is the world round,

49:57.634 --> 50:00.103
but it revolves
around the sun.

50:00.170 --> 50:03.606
Now we have that knowledge,
nothing stands in our way.

50:03.674 --> 50:05.675
No! No!
Shh.

50:05.743 --> 50:07.110
Shh.
No.

50:07.177 --> 50:10.880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

50:33.203 --> 50:35.204
Put it away. I come alone.

50:36.373 --> 50:38.741
Ready the horses,
the strongest you can find.

50:38.809 --> 50:39.969
We're going to
Constantinople.

50:40.010 --> 50:43.279
We will endure this,
my friend.

50:43.347 --> 50:46.883
I've endured worse.

50:46.950 --> 50:48.151
Dispose of them at once.
No!

50:48.218 --> 50:49.819
Father...

50:49.887 --> 50:52.822
Would it not be more advantageous
to keep them alive?

50:52.890 --> 50:56.793
Sparing them would make him
easier to manipulate.

50:56.860 --> 50:59.228
Not worth the risk.

50:59.296 --> 51:02.265
I will assume the risk.

51:06.970 --> 51:09.906
If either of you
can prove your value,

51:09.973 --> 51:12.875
perhaps you will leave
this place.

51:12.943 --> 51:15.945
If not, you'll die.

51:16.013 --> 51:19.215
Oh, please. Please.

51:19.283 --> 51:22.051
Spare my sister.

51:22.119 --> 51:26.155
Surely God would value
an innocent in all of this.

51:26.223 --> 51:28.591
You make
an interesting argument,

51:28.659 --> 51:34.096
but from now on,
God values...what I value.

51:34.164 --> 51:35.898
Come here, child.

51:39.236 --> 51:44.040
And while innocence
is a rare quality these days,

51:44.107 --> 51:46.776
as Girolamo will tell you,

51:46.844 --> 51:47.777
it's utterly useless to me.

51:47.845 --> 51:49.679
No!

51:49.746 --> 51:51.881
No!

51:54.084 --> 51:57.820
We're finished here.

51:57.888 --> 52:02.258
She will not take the harness
easily after today,

52:02.326 --> 52:05.761
but feel free to make of her
what you will.

52:05.829 --> 52:08.064
I tried, cousin.

52:21.812 --> 52:24.013
Your story will be simple.

52:24.081 --> 52:25.681
There was a struggle.

52:25.749 --> 52:28.818
Bandits took
your sister's life.

52:28.886 --> 52:31.821
If you breathe a word of this
to your adopted family,

52:31.889 --> 52:33.789
they will suffer
the same fate.

52:36.727 --> 52:38.194
You are Rome's
chattel now.

52:44.034 --> 52:48.271
Further instructions
will be forthcoming.

53:01.051 --> 53:03.185
Let me out! Please!

53:13.730 --> 53:15.798
No!

53:20.537 --> 53:23.172
You have to go.
No. Don't leave me.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.474
Get her off the ship!
No.

53:25.542 --> 53:27.243
No!

53:32.683 --> 53:34.951
Let me out, please!

53:35.018 --> 53:39.255
Anyone.
Anybody, please let me out.

53:39.323 --> 53:40.556
Please!

53:40.624 --> 53:43.626
Your Turk's prophecy.

53:43.694 --> 53:46.829
I fear he was right

54:07.217 --> 54:11.621
..in a chaos

54:15.192 --> 54:17.259
..just floating through
