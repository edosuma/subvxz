WEBVTT

00:07.908 --> 00:09.843
So what happened to Lamar?

00:09.877 --> 00:11.445
Well, we were a little
worried about him,

00:11.479 --> 00:13.914
uh, when he didn't land,

00:13.947 --> 00:16.784
but he called us from
a gas station in Manzanillo.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.653
He said he needed to disappear
for a little while.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.489
And, uh, you can't argue
with the guy.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.092
He's a genius, so...

00:24.125 --> 00:25.826
Right.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.231

Your note's due.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.209
What?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.144
The thousand you took
as an advance

00:43.177 --> 00:45.813
on your future shark earnings.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.416
Oh, yeah. Wow. Seems like
a really long time ago.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.650
Uh, take your time.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.486
Well, you know what, Burt?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.355
I got some pretty bad news
for you.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.191
Yeah. 'Cause I got
a steady job now.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.859
So I'll be able to pay you back

00:58.892 --> 01:04.031
ASAP and be out
from underneath you forever.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.737
Wait, Dud!
What happened to the scrolls?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.472
Oh, they're back in London.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.407
Where they belong.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.646
This car's a pain
in the ass, man.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.649
I told you. You gotta keep
an eye on the cooling vanes.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.351
Morning.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.153
Hey.
Hey.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.121
I appreciate the ride.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.889
Again.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.761
I'm gonna get the Thing back.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.963
First I've got to pay off
my shark loan.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.466
And my hospital bills,
'cause those are --

01:38.499 --> 01:40.768
-Is it bad?
-Yeah.

01:40.801 --> 01:45.573
There was a stack waiting
for me when I got back.

01:45.606 --> 01:49.109
We should've just stayed
in Mexico.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.345
That's the thing about a quest.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.846
It ends.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.915
Then you're back
on the order desk.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.824
[Knocking at door]

02:11.199 --> 02:13.667
35 hours
in a car with Tarquin.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.370
Mm-hmm.
That's a nightmare.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.472
Yeah, when he wasn't crying,

02:18.506 --> 02:22.610
he insisted on listening
to Janet's book on tape.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.778
I threw it out the window
somewhere around Hermosillo

02:24.812 --> 02:27.948
and then he slept for, like,
10 hours in the back seat.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.950
Hey, did you see
that Janet made bail?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.553
What?
Really?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.087
Isn't she a flight risk?

02:34.121 --> 02:36.824
You know, because of the way
she flew out of the country

02:36.857 --> 02:38.292
to avoid prosecution?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.960
No, the laws that keep
the proletariat

02:39.993 --> 02:42.496
in their place
don't apply to Janet.

02:42.530 --> 02:46.434
She exists beyond good and evil.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.970
Well, I guess it's back
to Temp Joy for all of us.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.307
Like a dog to vomit.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.109
Liz, I'm just so thankful
you squeezed

02:56.143 --> 02:59.480
the last bit of juice
out of Omni for us.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.981
That bonus...

03:01.014 --> 03:04.017
We can finally breathe
a little bit.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.387
Sarah wanted me to tell you
how much she appreciates it.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.755
It was nothing.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.089
Hmm.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.591
She also wanted me to tell you
that she forgives you

03:10.624 --> 03:12.560
for trying to seduce me.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.996
Thanks.
Yeah.

03:16.029 --> 03:20.968
I-I feel like a great burden
has been lifted.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.069

Dud, I speak Spanish.
I could've helped.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.341
It's not like I got anything
going on right now.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.976
I-I'm a made Woman
in the district.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.245

like that.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.480
I know!
Guys, I know!

03:32.513 --> 03:34.147
That's why I got you
these cool souvenirs.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.849
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.818
I missed Ernie jumping through
a burning tapestry,

03:37.851 --> 03:40.788
but I got a 50-cent shot glass,
so we're all good.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.456
What happened
to the Bitcoin lady?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.392
Daphne went back to Lodge 55

03:44.425 --> 03:45.626
to spend some time
with her new lover.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.696
Okay? Any more questions
or complaints?

03:48.729 --> 03:49.997
All you had to do was call.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.732
Oh, my God...

03:58.439 --> 04:00.374
[Scoffs]

04:01.475 --> 04:04.077
No more TVs, huh?

04:04.111 --> 04:05.713
Uh, nope.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.215
Didn't really go over the way
I'd hoped.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.251
So, uh, yeah,
I'm just gonna see if

04:11.285 --> 04:13.487
Best Buy will take these back.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.723
I don't think the TVs
were the problem.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.958
I mean, they just don't belong
in the tavern.

04:17.991 --> 04:22.830
It's a place to think and talk
and listen to some music.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.966
Why don't we hold on
to a couple of these?

04:25.999 --> 04:31.439
We could, uh, set them up in
the Throne Room for big games.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.040
Make a thing of it.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.775
Yeah...

04:34.808 --> 04:36.043
Yeah!

04:36.076 --> 04:39.079
That's a pretty good idea.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.414
So, this was in your shop?

04:40.448 --> 04:42.583
Good old Paracelsus.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.185
I went by that place today
to salvage

04:45.218 --> 04:48.255
what I could of the decor.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
The eviction went through
last week.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.460
Ah, man.
I'm sorry.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.027
I wish there was something
I could do.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.029
I'll figure something out.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.899
Mind if I stay
in the trailer until I do?

04:58.932 --> 05:02.636
Yes, no prob.
I'll just go stay with Liz.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.706
She, you know, pretends like
it's a hassle,

05:05.739 --> 05:09.910
but she gets bored
when I'm not around.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.513
Makes me happy to see
your leg start to heal.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.815
Yep.
It's getting there.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.283
The most important thing
of all of this

05:16.316 --> 05:17.418
was pulling that shark
tooth out of you.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.487
That's my calling.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.155
Hmm. Pulling shark teeth
out of people?

05:22.189 --> 05:25.225
Exactly.
I'm a healer.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.895
That's what I want
to get back to.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.262
No more scrolls.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.699
I still have the photos.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.967
Maybe I'll crack the code,
but I'm not holding my breath.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.704
Perhaps there is someone
who can read the scrolls,

05:36.737 --> 05:39.106
but it is not me --
and I'm fine with that.

05:39.139 --> 05:43.611
I'm done looking for a door
to another world.

05:43.644 --> 05:47.481
'Cause that door doesn't exist,
right?

that I've seen,

that's just...

05:55.756 --> 05:58.058
I can only speak for myself,
Dud.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.062
Here's what I do know.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.531
The scrolls are real.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.932
I held them in my hands.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.600
Yeah.
Same with me.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.868
They smell like eggplant.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.503
I'm more interested in
the human being behind

06:09.537 --> 06:12.473
all that stuff
that brought us to Mexico.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.041
What did Merrill know?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.476
What did he see?

06:15.509 --> 06:18.412
What's so special about
Long Beach and the Orbis land?

06:18.446 --> 06:20.080

06:20.113 --> 06:22.616
We are special.

06:22.650 --> 06:26.587
No more special than anyone
else, you know what I mean?

06:26.620 --> 06:27.688
Exactly.

but it's actually the advice

07:00.287 --> 07:01.121
Lamar gave me.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.657
He said write under a pen name.

into something else.

Yeah.

They know the scrolls
were taken.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.595

brought back to Long Beach.

are still there.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.079

All right.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.850
* Whoa, oh, oh

10:49.883 --> 10:54.354

[Inaudible]

10:54.387 --> 10:56.523

* And my heart is yearnin'
[Inaudible]

11:00.593 --> 11:02.462
* I know you can feel it

11:02.495 --> 11:07.600
* I can see it in your eyes

11:07.634 --> 11:10.270
It's a good thing
Dud showed up here.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.707
You needed a squire.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.976
Yep.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.245
Maybe you need one, too.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.281
Me?

11:21.314 --> 11:23.650
Every knight needs a squire.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.055
Why should the hospital
still get money from me?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.223
My wound is healed.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.894
So my debt should be healed,
too.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.796
That makes sense.
Yeah.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.032
I mean, really, what's
the worst they can do?

11:39.066 --> 11:42.770
Dud, they'll send it
to a debt collection agency.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.305
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.075
But -- but -- but so what?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.376
'Cause all those guys
do is they --

11:49.409 --> 11:51.678
they knock on your door
and then they say,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.147
"Hey, you need to forfeit
all your assets."

11:54.181 --> 11:57.350
But I don't have any assets.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.686
So, I win and they go home.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.356
I'm not sure it'll be that easy.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.959
It was for you.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.562
That was kind of a one-off.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.298
Eh.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.002
Look, don't worry.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.038
It's midnight.
Prime time for infomercials.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.439
Huh?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.775
Maybe you'll find some kind
of debt relief solution.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.543
Or a really good deal
on some catheters.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.978
That'd be great, too.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.214
We didn't get a great review
from Dr. Kimbrough

12:27.247 --> 12:28.381
for your last assignment.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.582
Mostly 3s and 4s.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.919
3s and 4s?
We like all 5s.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.653
Yeah, I know I might seem
biased saying this,

12:33.686 --> 12:38.158
but he was a lunatic,
and, I believe, a felon.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.893
Any requests, moving forward?

12:39.927 --> 12:43.030
Yeah, do you ever, like...

12:43.063 --> 12:45.098
bundle people for jobs?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.333
Bundle?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.668
Do your clients
ever need a team?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.908
I don't see what's hard
to understand about this.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.411
We're migratory creatures.
We move en masse.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.248
Temping is hard, Ross.
I don't need to tell you that.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
It's lonely and stressful

13:02.816 --> 13:04.952
just dropping into
someone else's world.

13:04.985 --> 13:09.622
So why not send a...

13:09.656 --> 13:13.793
pod of people who already
know each other?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.629
Commerce is an acid
that dissolves human bonds.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.866
Mm.
Send in the pods.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.634
Look, I am a better employee,
husband,

13:21.668 --> 13:24.004
and father
when I'm near Liz.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.907
This makes perfect sense.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.775
I'm not sure I can help you,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.210
but if you want
to stay together,

13:30.243 --> 13:32.545
why don't you find a way
to do that?

13:32.579 --> 13:35.182
Make a plan.
Start a business.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.716
Why not give it a try?

13:36.749 --> 13:40.053
Because we have no idea
what we're doing?

13:40.087 --> 13:43.891
Most businesses that I help
are complete disasters.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.458
No one knows what they're doing.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.395
So you have as good a chance
as anyone.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.533
[Slurping]

13:59.439 --> 14:02.675
Hey. This guy at Tento Pipe
said that Beautiful Jeff

14:02.709 --> 14:05.078
offered him 20%
off his china order.

14:05.112 --> 14:09.282
But I don't think the factory
is running any specials, so --

14:09.316 --> 14:10.884
We'll eat that 20%.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.120
Beautiful Jeff probably thinks
he can get that back

14:13.153 --> 14:16.456
and then some the next time a
big project goes through Tento.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.325
Oh.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.693
Ernie, Dud.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.729
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak with you two

14:22.762 --> 14:26.166
about a personal matter.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.935
I'm afraid it's serious.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.774
Thanks for sitting down
with me.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.877
This is hard.

Bob, are you all right?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.351

14:44.384 --> 14:46.819
We all think we're gonna be
around here forever,

14:46.853 --> 14:49.589
but then...

14:49.622 --> 14:53.360
It's a brief candle, gentlemen.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.295
A brief candle.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.866
What's going on, Bob?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.168
Are you...

15:01.201 --> 15:02.202
sick?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.436
We're here for you,
Bob.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.805
What? No!
I'm not sick.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.975
I'm going back to school.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.376
Oh.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.011
I figured it's now or never.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.514
I signed up for some more poetry
classes at City College.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.384
Plus a bunch of other stuff.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.987
I won't be around as much,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.022
and that's what I want to talk
to you about, Ernie.

15:22.055 --> 15:27.027
I was wondering if you could
take the helm whenever I'm gone.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.796
Stay on top of our factories,

15:29.829 --> 15:32.732
keep our outside salesmen
in line.

my current vehicle

situation, but it's...

15:44.411 --> 15:48.248
I got a feeling you can sell.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.284
Ernie will show you what's what.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.620
Hey, uh, what about
the order desk?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.921
That's easy.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.391
Just hire another couple
of knuckleheads to take over.

for a moment, can stop being
this superhero

to go to jail for you.

is going to be a doozy.

self-destructive power

23:25.572 --> 23:31.310
and I've never made
any real friends.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.579
Yes, you have.

23:32.612 --> 23:37.049
**

23:37.083 --> 23:39.719
Whoo!

23:39.752 --> 23:41.754
[Both laughing]

23:47.359 --> 23:49.596
Whoa!

23:49.629 --> 23:52.465
Whoo-hoo!

23:52.499 --> 23:54.467
Whoa!

23:54.501 --> 23:56.569
**

24:00.239 --> 24:03.275
This was a good decision.
It's a little more practical.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.177
Hey, thanks again
for the help, guys.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.345
No problem.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.014
You drilling for oil?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.749
Uh, no.
No, no.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.319
There's, uh,
nothing underneath here.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.121
Except the hollow Earth.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.556
Right.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.257
Oh man, I miss Lamar.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.026
Hey, we're neighbors,
by the way.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.161
I developed a little subdivision
over at Orbis.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.798
Nice.
Do you have beer in the trailer?

24:25.832 --> 24:27.834
Good. I can tell you about
the territorial disputes.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.101
They might spill over here.
Oh -- Oh, hey,

24:29.135 --> 24:31.270
Blaise, don't forget
about our meeting later.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.438
Okay.

24:32.471 --> 24:37.309
Liz, so, Sunday I-I'm taking
Sarah and Floyd

24:37.343 --> 24:38.578
out to Catalina.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.246
Okay.
Um, Champ's going.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.348
I think Gerson might
make it out, too.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.683
Oh.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.451
And I'd -- I'd love
to have you come along.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.453
You, too, Dud, if you're free.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.321
Catalina?
Catali-- Catalina?

24:49.355 --> 24:50.389
Yeah.
On Sunday.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.958
Yeah!
Nice.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.693
Great.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.835
I'm gonna do it.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.303
I'm gonna dig a pool.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.605
Really?

25:05.638 --> 25:06.773
Yeah!
I mean, why not?

25:06.806 --> 25:08.575
Look, we've got the slide here.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.310
There's more than enough room.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.112
All right.
Do it.

25:18.417 --> 25:25.124
**

25:25.157 --> 25:31.664
**

25:31.698 --> 25:34.801
Hey, you're the twin.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.836
Tony the psychic.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.370
I knew you'd be here.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.839
No, you didn't.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.941
You're 100% right.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.644
I walk the bluffs every day,

25:44.677 --> 25:46.112
and it's just
a fateful coincidence

25:46.145 --> 25:48.380
that you happen to be here.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.982
No, it's not.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.118
Well, in the most literal sense
of the term,

25:52.151 --> 25:53.820
it absolutely
is a coincidence.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.088
We can assign it
whatever meaning

25:56.122 --> 25:57.657
we want
after-the-fact.

25:57.690 --> 26:01.093
Okay, fine.
I assign no meaning to it.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.330
How'd it go at the track?

26:04.363 --> 26:05.698
Uh, we won.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.868
Yeah, the horse that was
supposed to win died.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.971
Exactly as I planned.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.840
I'm kidding.
That's terrible.

26:13.873 --> 26:17.143
But Lenore must
have been happy.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.045
Yeah.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.379
Ah.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.549
This unties all my knots.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.820
Ever since I turned 40,
I get terrible claustrophobia.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.455
I kicked out the back window
of my friend's

26:29.488 --> 26:31.991
Yukon the other day because
I was stuck in the middle seat

26:32.024 --> 26:34.627
and my buddies
wouldn't let me out.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.595
Your friends sound
like assholes.

26:36.629 --> 26:40.599
They're more colleagues
than friends.

26:40.633 --> 26:43.670
But this is nice.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.772
I'm a water person.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.507
They say the ocean is a mother.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.242
We all come from the sea.

26:52.712 --> 26:56.749
I've been spending time
in freezers.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.218
The cold relaxes me.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.789
I have dreams about blizzards
and ice sheets.

27:02.822 --> 27:03.823
I'm not a therapist.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.725
You're a pretend psychic.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.994
Thermodynamics.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.429
Cold is an end point.

27:10.462 --> 27:15.134
Cold is the abyss.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.269
So basically I have
a death wish.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.706
I've heard that before.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.841
The abyss isn't death.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.642
That's just a fable God made up

27:23.676 --> 27:25.878
to keep us
away from the truth.

27:29.215 --> 27:32.852
Maybe you're just drawn
to what other people fear.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.489
That probably makes you
more alive.

27:37.523 --> 27:44.296
**

27:44.330 --> 27:50.937
**

27:50.970 --> 27:52.839
Oh! Here he comes.
Okay.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.976
Um, all right,
so we got a deal, right?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.278
Sean, I just want someone
paying rent.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.714
I don't care who.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.115
Hey.
Hey, thanks for coming.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.951
Oh, sure, yeah.
What's going on?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.685
What's all the mystery about?

28:06.719 --> 28:09.188
Uh, Blaise,
this is Mr. Lang.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.823
He is a property agent.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.926
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Lang.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.864
Um, well, since Dudley & Son
left he's had kind of a, uh,

28:17.897 --> 28:22.368
kind of a hard time
finding a stable tenant.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.436
Uh, and hard to say why.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.838
You know?
I don't know.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.741
Um, could be the current
economic climate.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.476
Could be something else.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.178
Yes, there's no way to know.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.179
Nope, there's not.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.114
So, anyway, I told him
about you,

28:35.147 --> 28:37.083
and, uh, well,

28:37.116 --> 28:40.787
he's willing to offer you
a really good deal,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.288
and he said he can even
float you a couple months

28:42.321 --> 28:44.490
while you're getting
your things up and running.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.726
I...
I can't take this place.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.162
It's your family's.
It's sacred.

28:50.196 --> 28:54.333
I know. That's why you are the
only person who can be in here.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.703
Because you understand
those type of things.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.871
And, Blaise,
you're like family now,

28:58.905 --> 29:02.608
and I want you
to have a home.

29:02.641 --> 29:06.012
**

29:06.045 --> 29:07.713
I'll take good care of it.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.749
**

29:15.888 --> 29:17.556
You too, Mr. Lang.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.860
**

29:24.230 --> 29:29.468
**

29:29.501 --> 29:31.403
Hey.
Hey.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.538
There you are.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.240
Hey.
We're about to start.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.842
Okay, okay.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.209
Yeah.
I'm ready.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.544
All right.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.113
Why are we whispering?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.249
I don't know --
because you whisper

29:43.282 --> 29:45.751
when things are important;
tonight is

29:45.784 --> 29:47.419
an important night, Ernie.
It's your moment.

29:47.453 --> 29:54.460
Dud, I want this
to be your moment, too.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.698
I want to make you a knight.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.400
You've earned it.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.135
Yeah?
Wow.

30:04.904 --> 30:09.641
Um, thanks, Ernie, but...

30:09.675 --> 30:12.111
What is it?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.846
I don't know.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.184
I don't know.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.156
It's weird.

30:27.326 --> 30:31.297
I couldn't be happier
than I am right now.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.899
Truly.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.600
I knocked on a door

30:34.633 --> 30:39.171
and it changed everything.

30:39.205 --> 30:42.875
I feel so lucky.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.913
The things that I've seen
and done --

30:46.946 --> 30:50.950
I mean,
I never imagined.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.753
Mexico?
Come on.

30:54.786 --> 30:59.658
And I am so excited to see
what happens next...

31:02.261 --> 31:05.564
but right now, I...

31:05.597 --> 31:07.900
I don't know.

31:07.934 --> 31:11.437
All I can feel...

31:11.470 --> 31:13.205
is this shadow.

31:16.976 --> 31:20.179
And I wish my dad were here

31:20.212 --> 31:22.681
to see where I am,

31:22.714 --> 31:24.416
see where I'm going.

31:29.288 --> 31:35.794
But I know that the only
reason that I'm here

31:35.827 --> 31:38.064
is because Liz and I lost him...

31:41.833 --> 31:44.503
And sometimes I don't know
how to square that.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.509
I don't know if I can handle
paying that kind of price.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.683
Everything is all tangled.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.186
The good stuff,
the bad stuff...

32:03.489 --> 32:10.496
And it just seems unfair...
that on some days...

32:14.433 --> 32:17.869
all of the beautiful things
in my life break my heart.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.484
Will it always feel this way?

32:49.068 --> 32:50.802
Yes.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.773
Always.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.012
But that's the deal.

33:00.046 --> 33:06.285
**

33:06.318 --> 33:09.388
I'm not ready to be a knight,
Ernie.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.124
I need to clock
a few more miles.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.729
Fair enough.

33:17.763 --> 33:22.434
But in the meantime,

33:22.468 --> 33:25.204
I've have something for you.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.141
Holy shit.

33:29.175 --> 33:33.145
Wha-- Ernie -- Wait.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.681
Um, Ernie,
how'd you afford this?

33:35.714 --> 33:39.785
Between my dumping money
and selling my Caddy,

33:39.818 --> 33:41.487
I had enough.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.157
Dud, it's the least I could do.

33:45.191 --> 33:49.495
**

33:49.528 --> 33:54.400
* You may search

33:54.433 --> 33:57.236
* At any cost

33:57.269 --> 34:01.507
**

34:01.540 --> 34:07.113
* But how long can you search

34:07.146 --> 34:11.083
* For what's not lost?

34:11.117 --> 34:14.953
**

34:14.986 --> 34:21.127
* Everybody

34:21.160 --> 34:24.463
* Will help you

34:24.496 --> 34:30.702
* Some people are very kind

34:30.736 --> 34:32.971
**

34:33.004 --> 34:37.843
* But if I

34:37.876 --> 34:41.780
* Can save you any time

34:41.813 --> 34:46.885
[Cheering and applause]

34:46.918 --> 34:51.390
I've been here a long time.

34:51.423 --> 34:55.861
When I first walked
in that door, I was pretty lost.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.896
But Larry was here.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.799
And all of you.

35:00.832 --> 35:05.070
This lodge means more to me
than I can say.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.340
I've tried to be a good knight.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.876
I've failed many times,

35:10.909 --> 35:13.879
but hopefully I've learned
some things along the way.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.550
For a long time

35:18.584 --> 35:21.853
I took the lodge for granted.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.856
I stopped seeing it, you know?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.359
But then something happened.

35:27.393 --> 35:30.729
This kid knocked on the door.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.898
I was hoping it was
the carpet cleaner...

35:32.931 --> 35:34.900
[Laughter]

35:34.933 --> 35:37.936
But it was Dud.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.139
And since then, well, heh,

35:41.173 --> 35:45.010
since then a lot has happened.

35:45.043 --> 35:49.215
And through it all -- Ah, man.

35:49.248 --> 35:55.120
Dud, I don't know
how the hell you did it.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.557
But you kept us all together.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.427
You got us here,

36:01.460 --> 36:05.864
you believed in this place,

36:05.897 --> 36:10.269
and all I can now is thank you.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.172
Thank you.

36:20.111 --> 36:24.483
Now I'm seeing the lodge
in a new way.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.519
I still want to compete
for titles

36:27.553 --> 36:29.855
in muni league softball, yes,

36:29.888 --> 36:35.461
but I also cannot deny
some strange doors

36:35.494 --> 36:38.997
have been opening around here.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.368
New rooms have been discovered.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.337
And as we move forward,
we should keep an eye

36:45.371 --> 36:50.041
on the past, history
and traditions that got us here.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.711
Let us dig deep.

36:52.744 --> 36:58.984
And let us remember that
outside these walls,

36:59.017 --> 37:03.655
the world can be
a cold, cold place.

37:05.524 --> 37:12.531
But in here, when we're
all together,

37:12.764 --> 37:17.269
it's different.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.671
It's different in here.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.274
**

37:22.308 --> 37:26.678
[Applause]

37:26.712 --> 37:29.948
[Cheering]

37:29.981 --> 37:33.985
**

37:34.019 --> 37:38.324
Hey, Long Beach!
Keep your water crystal clear
