30:42.266 --> 30:44.099
by ASA troops and commandos.

30:44.101 --> 30:46.193
People resisting have
been beaten and shot.

30:46.195 --> 30:48.245

30:50.199 --> 30:52.700

30:52.702 --> 30:56.612
Nevertheless, Markovia recently
launched a daring attack

30:56.614 --> 31:00.449
on an ASA detainment facility
resulting in ASA causalities.

31:00.451 --> 31:03.243
Meanwhile, a resistance
has begun to arise

31:03.245 --> 31:04.637
and their symbol is a meta-human

31:04.639 --> 31:06.497

31:06.499 --> 31:09.833
It is perhaps the unanswered
questions that are the most troubling.

31:09.835 --> 31:12.386
Where are the city's heroes,
Black Lightning and Thunder?

31:12.388 --> 31:14.797
And what is the ASA
doing with the pod kids

31:14.799 --> 31:17.256

babies? I'm Jamillah Olsen.

32:24.052 --> 32:25.301
Be brief.

32:26.954 --> 32:29.222
I believe it unwise

32:29.224 --> 32:32.725
to send the Painkiller asset
to that particular target,

32:32.727 --> 32:33.768
first time out.

32:36.589 --> 32:39.649
The brain chip is in
place and it's working.

32:43.637 --> 32:44.761
It hasn't been tested.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.072
This is the test.

32:48.243 --> 32:51.268
But having him kill his own mother?

32:51.270 --> 32:54.038
If there's anything that
could reverse a mindwipe...

32:55.774 --> 32:59.794
Meaning the brain chip
doesn't work, but...

33:01.089 --> 33:02.213
if he kills her...

33:03.424 --> 33:05.091
Then we know it does.

33:05.093 --> 33:08.427
And can be applied as required

33:08.429 --> 33:12.515

Are you okay?

33:46.209 --> 33:49.010
No. No, I'm not okay.

33:50.379 --> 33:52.546
They told me to take a break and eat.

33:52.548 --> 33:54.588
But what's the point? I'm
just going to throw it up.

33:57.220 --> 33:58.311
Yeah, I feel you.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.647
I... felt the same way.

Hold on.

You have powers like Black Lightning's.

34:19.574 --> 34:21.083

They even make us fight.

34:35.350 --> 34:36.949
[MARYAM] People get
hurt really bad here.

34:39.434 --> 34:41.667
But I guess we'll fall
apart on our own anyway.

34:43.942 --> 34:46.275
I know one girl who lost
her fingers and her toes.

34:47.678 --> 34:49.737

No.

Okay, thanks.

Help me out here.

35:35.851 --> 35:39.603
I've been reviewing data
myself and I noticed...

35:39.605 --> 35:42.017
a... a spike

35:44.443 --> 35:47.911
in Mr. Pierce's neuron
activity that correlates

35:47.913 --> 35:51.615
with an energy flux that
we're reading at the lab.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.260
Can you... tell me about this?

35:57.340 --> 35:58.989
[LYNN] I've no idea.

Well, I saw her. She
seems to be recovering.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.987
You saw her?

37:03.989 --> 37:05.909
Yeah, I checked on her
while you were in the lab.

37:08.836 --> 37:10.079
That was nice of you.

37:11.247 --> 37:12.825
It turns out I was right.

37:19.204 --> 37:23.099
Wait. You pumped a sick
teenager for information?

37:24.852 --> 37:27.686
Do you even consider the kind
of trouble she could get into?

37:27.688 --> 37:29.713
No, no. I threw up the static field

37:29.715 --> 37:31.214
like I use for our privacy.

37:31.216 --> 37:33.383
Yeah, "used" is the right word.

just got to be in control,

that you should be asking.

what she's going through

37:52.713 --> 37:55.456

- No, you don't.

to deal with this. She hasn't.

she's going through.
