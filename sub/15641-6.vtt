WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.461
This season on Hit the Floor...

00:02.628 --> 00:06.258
You were an original Devil Girl,
coolest first job ever.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.554
- Babe, you're doing it?
- I don't know.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.845
If you think you can come in here
and take one of our spots...

00:11.011 --> 00:14.185
- Ahsha? Don't be late.
- Oh, my God!

00:14.348 --> 00:16.350
- Listen, be careful.
- I will.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.940
- The girls are not my responsibility.
- Wrong.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.735
Ahsha is your responsibility.
She's your daughter.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.070
If she finds out about this,
it'll tear her away from me

00:24.233 --> 00:27.954
-just when she needs me the most.
- I won't tell Ahsha that I am her father.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.580
It's one thing to perform
in front of this crowd,

00:30.739 --> 00:32.457
but to perform
in front of your daddy too?

00:32.616 --> 00:35.916
- My what?
- Pete Davenport, your father.

00:36.078 --> 00:39.457
Is it true?
You told me it was a one-night stand!

00:39.581 --> 00:43.211
- I know it's so confusing right now.
- You lied to me.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.674
I want to talk about Ahsha.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.464
If you want to dig up the bones from
that night, it's not gonna happen.

00:47.631 --> 00:52.512
I screwed up the one good thing in
my life and I wrecked the hell out of it.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.181
- You want a drink?
- How do you want me to handle Ahsha?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.898
You're just gonna have
to start from scratch.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.525
Didn't I hear your coach say
something about

00:58.684 --> 01:00.527
no messing around between
Devils and Devil Girls?

01:00.686 --> 01:02.780
- Technically you're not a Devil Girl.
- I don't think my boyfriend cares

01:02.938 --> 01:04.611
about your technicalities.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.901
- What are you scared of out there?
- I'm supposed to be doing

01:07.025 --> 01:09.323
the super-smoking solo shot
and it's not happening.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.488
- When does your head clear?
- When I dance.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.908
-I jUSt g()_
- SO gQ_

01:14.074 --> 01:16.918
- I'm Jelena Howard.
- What you did to Ahsha was foul.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.500
- Derek is an excellent coach.
- He coaches ball?

01:19.621 --> 01:23.091
Actually I was talking about him
coaching Ahsha at the calendar shoot.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.002
He helped her nail it.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.347
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you want to give to charity

01:29.506 --> 01:31.053
and dance with your girl?

01:31.216 --> 01:34.641
- You know she has a boyfriend?
- Yeah, not exactly competition for you.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.396
- You want to dance?
- I'm not up for it.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.478
I remember you used to dance
like a tornado.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.233
That was a long time ago.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.645
You want to dance?

01:42.811 --> 01:46.111
If I were to have stayed with Pete,
I would have died.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.243
Getting pregnant saved my life.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.280
Before I knew who my father was,
I could make him anyone I wanted.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.995
Now that I know the reality,
I don't want to know any more.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.285
- Mia's gone? When?
- Last night.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.500
Mia, the point of you getting gone
was staying gone.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.715
This was delivered here for you.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.211
Call me again and I stop being so nice.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.345
Remember that dancer? The one
who took off right before the tryouts?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.511
- She's reaching out.
- You need to find out where she is.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.391
Already done.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.554
I went to Mia's apartment.
Was she an escort?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.932
Oscar is buying you all new uniforms.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.726
As you know, all that he asks
is that the old ones be turned in.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.021
We have an authentic
Devil Girls uniform

02:25.145 --> 02:27.273
worn by Mia,
a member of last year's team.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.989
Congratulations.
She's yours to play with for $7,000.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.494
The microphone's still out there.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.886
Santa Ana's have officially
ruined my garden.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.097
That and you have no green thumb.

03:02.808 --> 03:07.314
- You're freaking me out.
- I'm just stupid happy that you're home.

03:07.479 --> 03:12.827
I'm home, but I'm not home, home.
You know I live with German now.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.867
I know German's apartment
is the size of a Quaker Oats' box

03:16.029 --> 03:18.123
and I know that boy can't cook
as good as I do.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.080
At least at German's there's also
real junk food in the house.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.541
Just because it's vegan
doesn't mean it isn't real.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.962
Just because it's the size of a Quaker
Oats' box doesn't mean it isn't home.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.091
I've got to jet.
There's a big game tomorrow.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.348
Stay.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.552
Baby steps.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.327
Five, six, seven, eight.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.615
Punch,punch,punch,
kick, kick, slide, kick.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.914
And one, two, three, four. Around.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.580
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.971
This good enough
for your precious game tonight?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.096
We need bigger.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.884
Dallas knocked us
out of the playoffs last year.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.270
This game is sold-out.
We're gonna be wall-to-wall press.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.898
We need spectacle.

04:28.059 --> 04:32.485
You heard him, ladies.
Barrel combo. From the top.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.868
Excuse me. Miss Howard.
your car alarm's going off.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.372
Oh, this wind. 'll be back in 15.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.079
- Don't get comfortable.
- Ladies.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.247
You know,
the Santa Ana winds do more

04:48.413 --> 04:50.415
than knock down trees
and set off car alarms.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.883
What are you talking about?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.794
They're always blowing up
someone's skirt.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.386
The hot Santa Anas
always lead to hot sex.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.846
It's a thing. And you don't know that
'cause you're not from here.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.979
And you're not from here either.
How do you know?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.311
'Cause mine was the skirt
that got blown up.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.108
Mark my words.
Someone's hooking up.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.864
Keep an eye out for guilty faces.

05:28.537 --> 05:32.883
- What?
- Nothing.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.386
- You look fine.
- I look fine?

05:36.503 --> 05:40.007
Well, you could look better,
that's all I'm saying.

05:40.173 --> 05:44.269
Oh, good, I thought you were saying
something really horrible to me.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.104
Maybe if you try this.

05:47.889 --> 05:51.314
Oh, wow. This is gaudy.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.314
Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's cute.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.075
I thought it was a joke.
I don't own any costume jewellery.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.279
That's not costume jewellery.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.411
This is real? Like, real-real?

06:10.620 --> 06:14.625
- How much did this cost?
- It doesn't matter.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.885
It kind of does.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.764
- Germ, these are diamonds.
- You deserve them.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.432
I'm serious.
How much did this cost?

06:29.347 --> 06:33.068
- Five.
- Five what?

06:34.936 --> 06:38.281
$5,000?
Where did you get the money for this?

06:38.440 --> 06:39.862
I had it.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.988
That was your money for grad school.
You blew it on a bracelet?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.906
I spent it on you.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.751
Thank you would be nice.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.789
What were you thinking throwing your
Masters away for a piece of jewellery?

06:52.954 --> 06:56.629
Derek Roman paid $100,000
for a piece of you!

06:56.791 --> 07:00.841
He didn't pay me.
It was a dance for charity.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.221
Do you think I can be bought?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.220
Well, you seemed pretty impressed.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.223
But hey, what do I know?

07:11.389 --> 07:15.019
I'm just some idiot in a polyester suit
watching from the sidelines.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.941
You told me
it was okay to dance with him.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.236
I wasn't going to stop you.
You should have stopped yourself!

07:20.398 --> 07:23.823
Are you kidding me?
Maybe I should move back home.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.322
We didn't argue
when we weren't living together.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.832
- So now you want to move out?
- I don't want to move out.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.368
I want to stop arguing
and I want my boyfriend

07:31.534 --> 07:34.083
to stop treating me like a hooker.

07:43.922 --> 07:47.472
Sweet Jesus.
It's the end of days out there.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.261
If you hadn't have pulled up
when you did,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.101
my rocking chair would be halfway
to Pasadena by now.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.316
Always here to help, ma'am.

07:57.644 --> 08:02.741
- So, what brings you around?
- I need a reason?

08:06.695 --> 08:11.166
I saw you and Ahsha
holding hands at the auction.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.248
Yeah. We turned a corner.

08:14.411 --> 08:20.293
Not quite there yet, but we're heading
in the right direction.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.837
That's great.

08:24.004 --> 08:29.181
Ahsha and I drove off a cliff.
She doesn't want anything to do with me.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.014
Sorry.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.024
Yeah, well, when you spend your life
making stupid decisions,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.440
you're gonna eventually be
judged for them.

08:43.398 --> 08:47.869
And the stupidest decisions
I made were the ones that hurt you.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.495
Sloane, there are so many things
that I want to say to you

08:53.658 --> 08:57.583
and I'm sure there's plenty
that you want to say to me.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.509
Pete, I don't want to give you
the wrong idea. I just...

09:04.419 --> 09:07.798
Sloane, don't, I mean, don't even...
Please, you don't have to...

09:09.215 --> 09:13.311
I don't even know what that was.
I was just...

09:13.470 --> 09:15.222
I was just saying...

09:16.723 --> 09:19.897
-careful with the wind.
- You, too.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.909
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:36.076 --> 09:45.463
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.222
One, two, three, four,
five, six, barrel turn.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.508
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.676
One, two, down to the floor.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.181
Good. Not great.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.360
- Again.
- I'm sorry, Miss Howard, your car alarm.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.647
You've got to be kidding me.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.035
Yes.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.746
- That's the face of death.
- Do you have a minute?

10:20.912 --> 10:24.542
I need to talk to someone and you're
the only one around here I can trust.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.842
- Yeah, what happened?
- I had a fight with German.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.005
Spill it.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.514
Actually, I just remembered
I need to be somewhere.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.432
Ahsha. Hey.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.438
That was weird.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.616
- I'm sorry.
- Well, hello, handsome.

10:56.739 --> 11:01.245
- Don't be shy. I'm not.
- I'm looking for Ahsha.

11:02.287 --> 11:06.337
Oh, God, I knew the insecure boyfriend
was gonna show up at some point.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.677
What's wrong with you?
Have a fight with your boyfriend?

11:16.843 --> 11:20.188
You're the last person
I'm talking relationship problems with.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.275
So there are problems.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.968
Hello?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.432
Who's there?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.238
Mia.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.450
The power's out
in the entire goddamn arena.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.459
Why the hell is
the backup generator not on?

12:24.619 --> 12:28.044
We have a game tonight,
a huge game, a sold-out game.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.335
Get the power back on
and get it on now.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.424
There is no "or else".

12:34.879 --> 12:37.007
What happens if you don't get
the power back in time?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.346
We're getting power back.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.691
You don't look so good, Mia.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.780
I haven't slept in days.
I can't stop moving.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.817
They found me. They found me
and it's all your fault.

12:56.401 --> 13:00.326
And it's gonna take more than cash
to get rid of me this time.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.628
- Not working?
- No, it was.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.964
I just had
the quietest conversation ever.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.750
Hey, don't take your fight
with your boyfriend out on me.

13:11.916 --> 13:16.046
- We did not have a fight!
- It was about our dance, huh?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.385
I left home so fast
I left my phone there.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.346
You stormed out because of the fight.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.557
- Where's your phone?
-It's in my locker.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.643
Wonder if I could climb out of here.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.935
Calm down, Lara Croft. They can't have
a game without me. They'll find us.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.278
What are we supposed to do until then?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.490
Be patient and wait.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.362
He was crazy jealous, wasn't he?

13:44.741 --> 13:47.415
Of course, dancing with him
was gonna bother me.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.296
I mean, everybody's oohing and ahing
like he's something special.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.676
He is not all that. He drops 100 Gs
to dance with her and that's okay?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.928
I spend five grand
on a diamond bracelet

13:57.086 --> 13:59.635
-and she freaks out on me.
- Diamond bracelet?

13:59.797 --> 14:04.052
Yeah, she might as well have chucked it
at me on the way out of the door.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.597
- Do you have it on you?
- Yeah.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.529
I can't believe she didn't fall
to her knees over this.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.074
I'm really good at shadow puppets.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.080
Cheers Miguel right up.
Okay, check out this one.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.128
It's Oscar sexually harassing himself.

14:33.122 --> 14:39.095
That's good. Sorry,
I appreciate the effort, I just...

14:39.253 --> 14:42.678
It's gonna take more than
shadow puppets to pull me out of this.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.974
I'm a really good listener. Try me.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.688
Ahsha is my daughter.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.031
That's...

15:12.286 --> 15:16.666
I... Sorry, I have to grab
some supplies out of the...

15:16.833 --> 15:21.339
- Supply closet.
- Sorry. Be right back.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.899
- How is your being on the run my fault?
- You told people where I was hiding.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.693
- I didn't tell anyone anything.
- They found me.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.608
You were the only one who knew.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.572
The amount that
you were blowing up my cell,

15:43.734 --> 15:46.283
you didn't try and bother anyone else?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.623
Olivia.

15:51.826 --> 15:55.000
You've clearly figured it out.
Be a stranger.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.292
- I came here because I need your help.
- I gave you help.

15:58.458 --> 16:03.009
You gave me cash.
I came to you scared and alone

16:03.171 --> 16:06.766
and you wouldn't even let me tell you
what I went through that night.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.473
You just forced money in my hand
and told me to go.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.639
- That's what you needed.
- No, that's what you needed.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.105
And in a twisted way
you think I was a threat,

16:16.225 --> 16:18.694
you saw your chance
to get rid of me and you took it.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.402
Your opinion of yourself
is as high as you are.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.907
You're gonna make it up to me.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.904
I need something
and you are gonna get it for me.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.948
- What's that?
- My uniform.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.547
You want your uniform?

16:38.664 --> 16:42.885
For what? To dance around in?
Relive the days when you mattered?

16:43.044 --> 16:46.093
One of my uniforms was auctioned off
at the charity weekend.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.680
I left it in my locker.
I need you to track it down for me.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.265
Olivia said she found that uniform
in your apartment

16:52.428 --> 16:56.228
along with key cards to half the hotels
in Los Angeles.

16:56.390 --> 17:01.487
My apartment? I was wearing that one
the night my place got broken into,

17:01.646 --> 17:03.865
the night I left town.
It's not the one I need.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.992
He doesn't have it either.
It's still out there.

17:20.748 --> 17:25.253
Raquel. You couldn't have run out
of candles in the playground.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.556
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine. I just...

17:30.800 --> 17:35.271
Coach Davenport told me something
and it's just...

17:35.429 --> 17:38.308
I don't even know.
I can't say what it is.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.524
It involves someone you work with,
someone that works for you.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.195
Ahsha?

17:46.357 --> 17:47.859
I know.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.910
I also know you have feelings for him.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.701
How?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.954
I recognise that look on your face.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.499
I've seen it before.

18:02.623 --> 18:08.596
I can't help it, but Ahsha?
That's just too weird.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.434
Raquel, this is your MO.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.602
You follow your heart and ignore
your brain. You did it with Jesse.

18:19.724 --> 18:24.195
Trust me. Pete Davenport is not
a road you want to go down.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.698
You know what they say.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.496
<i>Santa Ana's are baby makers.</i>

18:41.912 --> 18:43.914
Thumb war?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.719
It's been 100 years.
I thought you were important.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.600
Relax. Enjoy yourself.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.726
What was that?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.190
Hello?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.902
Yeah, I got your message.
I've just been busy.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.024
I'm not lying.
Right after the game I went to treatment

19:10.191 --> 19:12.410
and then I had
a press conference and...

19:12.568 --> 19:15.788
Look, I'm sorry, tell me what
you want me to say and I'll say it.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.290
What the hell? You said
you left your phone in your locker.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.201
That doesn't give you the right
to hang up on my call.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.995
No, it gives me the right
because I'm not gonna sit here

19:22.161 --> 19:23.788
and listen to you have a dumb fight
with some dumb girl.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.582
That's not some dumb girl.
That's my mother.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.596
Why would you lie
about not having your phone?

19:32.755 --> 19:36.635
What did you think, that I was just gonna
do you right here in the elevator?

19:39.720 --> 19:44.100
Fine, you know what, yeah.
I want to have sex with you. Deal with it.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.529
There. I dealt with it.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.494
The backup generator's gonna
take hours before it's up and running.

19:55.653 --> 20:00.204
We don't have hours. I can delay
the game but I can't cancel it.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.540
Ticket sales, broadcast fees.
I'm not taking that kind of hit.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.881
You've got till 8:30
to get it going for a 9:00 game.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.133
- What if we can't?
- You will.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.722
Get it done.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.111
Chase?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.245
What are you doing here?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.678
Chase.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.954
- I freaked you out.
- What?

21:20.112 --> 21:24.333
- I freaked you out.
- No. Ahsha and I are friends.

21:25.326 --> 21:29.581
And I just dropped this on you.
I'm sorry.

21:29.747 --> 21:36.380
I... I just found out myself
and I haven't had to tell anyone yet.

21:36.504 --> 21:40.099
- I'm the first?
- You are the first.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.392
Why are you just finding out?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.813
I haven't always been the nicest guy.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.980
- I used to roll with guys like Jesse.
- You are nothing like Jesse.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.867
He never told me anything
and what he did tell me was a lie.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.580
You... You got rid of Jesse for me.
You're my hero.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.913
What's wrong
with hearing you're a great guy?

22:09.703 --> 22:15.801
Okay, you may want people
to think you're this gruff lost cause.

22:15.960 --> 22:22.058
You may think that yourself but...
I see you for who you really are.

22:25.219 --> 22:29.315
You're a good man, Pete Davenport.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.752
Why'd you stop?

22:56.375 --> 23:02.929
Raquel, you are beautiful and amazing

23:03.090 --> 23:08.267
and there was a time that I would
take this all the way if I could and...

23:10.931 --> 23:13.559
I want to be a different guy.

23:17.313 --> 23:21.443
-I got to go,
- Okay.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.626
What's so important
about this stupid uniform?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.747
It's got proof that
could give me my life back.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.541
In that case,
maybe I should get to it first.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.090
- You'll have to beat me and Oscar.
- Oscar?

23:41.420 --> 23:44.014
I'm not trying to get
on Oscar's bad side.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.143
Just tell me where it could be
and I'll find it myself.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.261
We got new uniforms.

23:49.428 --> 23:53.274
It's either in the trash where it belongs
or some other girl got stuck with it.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.434
Haunt them. I'm out.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.704
I could have gone pro like Derek.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.995
I could be paying $100,000
to dance with Ahsha.

24:11.158 --> 24:15.083
Man, if I didn't choke when I got scouted,
everything would be different.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.920
- Honey, you were never going pro.
- Excuse me?

24:19.083 --> 24:23.213
You're four-foot nothing. I don't care
how big of a star you were in college.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.552
You're Jiminy Cricket next to the guys
in the pros.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.844
- Nate Robinson is 5' 9".
- Here comes the laundry list.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.012
Avery Johnson was 5' 10".

24:32.179 --> 24:34.398
Spud Webb, Charlie Criss,
Isaiah Thomas--

24:34.556 --> 24:37.730
Obviously you have a hard time
facing the facts.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.022
You're talking to the right person,
because I'm all about facts.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.442
I'm gonna help you.
One broke bitch to another.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.904
You're worried
you choked away your opportunity.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.073
You didn't. You never had a chance.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.164
You're worried Derek Roman
wants to have sex with Ahsha.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.500
He does, for sure.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.295
I mean, he's hit on her 100 times
from Christmas.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.459
He has 3O million in his bank account.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.962
If he wanted to buy her an island,
he could.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.131
I play Derek's game.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.301
If he was hitting on me
and paid $100,000 for a dance,

25:10.426 --> 25:12.804
I'd give him this, that
and everything in between.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.395
If he offered to buy me an island,
I'd ask for two

25:16.557 --> 25:19.731
and then I'd give him more pleasure
than a Princess Cruise.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.488
Ahsha?
Ahsha doesn't play Derek's game.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.399
Ahsha plays your game.

25:25.566 --> 25:29.867
By buying her this, you pulled a Derek
move on a gym teacher's salary.

25:30.988 --> 25:35.835
Game over. Your whole brawl with
Care Bear is your fault, not hers.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.881
Baby.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.847
What's going on?

25:53.427 --> 25:56.021
Whenever you're like this,
something's wrong.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.437
Work crap.

26:01.602 --> 26:05.732
Liv, no one wants to see me
as a businessman.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.903
It's like, all they want to do is
talk about that game back in '92.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.415
It was a great game.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.286
You don't even know
which one I'm talking about.

26:18.452 --> 26:21.706
That's because
they were all great, baby.

26:23.874 --> 26:27.469
I know what it's like
not to be taken seriously.

26:29.338 --> 26:33.809
It just makes you want to work
that much harder to make them.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.639
They'll see.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.272
Trust me.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.078
Do you know how many numbers
I had on this phone?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.615
I'm sure your phone has herpes.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.835
Don't be a million dollar baby.
You get everything you want.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.620
You won't die without your phone.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.089
I may be a million dollar baby
that gets whatever he wants,

27:04.248 --> 27:06.376
but you're a dancer
that doesn't know how to have fun.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.877
- Says who?
- Says me.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.091
Look, every time I see you
you're stressed the hell out.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.053
And every time I see you, you're
pretending to be someone you're not.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.717
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.683
"Well, hello, ladies. Oh, I'm a fan
of a whole bunch of things.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.393
"You want me to dance?
Oh, I'll dance for you."

27:20.556 --> 27:23.651
You and your stupid pick-up lines.
your stupid grand entrances.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.686
With your dollar-store hookers
under each stupid arm,

27:25.853 --> 27:28.572
your ridiculous oil paintings,
your popping bottles.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.653
It's all to cover your insecurities.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.695
Insecurities you can't hide from
when off this elevator

27:33.861 --> 27:37.161
and go home to your big, great,
stupid, empty house!

27:43.412 --> 27:45.961
I didn't... I didn't mean...

27:48.625 --> 27:52.095
The whole no pictures
of your family in your house thing.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.803
When I asked you,
you were like, whatever.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.094
You said you and your mom were cool.
Were you lying?

27:58.260 --> 28:00.228
Don't.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.434
- You were just arguing with her.
- Ahsha.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.274
We're stuck on an elevator,
why not talk about it?

28:07.436 --> 28:11.191
- Because I don't want to.
- I do. Be honest for once in your life.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.200
You want to be Captain Save-A-Ho,
but I'm not some dude you need to save.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.784
I'm a dude you want to have sex with,
but you can't handle it.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.074
- I do not!
- Look, you be honest.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.368
Admit it. Admit that you want me.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.083
You wanted me from the minute
you saw me, just like I wanted you.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.964
Your ego is unreal.
Your head is so far up your--

28:47.226 --> 28:50.070
- What are you doing here?
- I came to say sorry.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.983
What I said earlier.

28:54.149 --> 28:59.246
Having you back is
having an effect on me.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.202
I mean, it's bringing up feelings,

29:01.365 --> 29:05.211
well, feelings that you've had
2O years to forget.

29:06.203 --> 29:10.003
I just... I'm sure you put me
to bed a long time ago.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.763
You're right. I have.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.221
What happened?

29:24.388 --> 29:26.015
Tree branch smashed
through my window.

29:26.139 --> 29:29.484
Scared the hell out of me. I boarded it
up the best I could. Watch out.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.190
I haven't cleaned up all the glass yet.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.448
Yeah, well, you used
one and three quarter inch screws here

29:34.606 --> 29:36.608
and this board is a monster.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.779
You have to drive those
in at least two and a half

29:39.903 --> 29:42.497
and you have two boards here,
so you've got a seam here.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.375
You need bracing for the entire seam
and some people say you have to put

29:45.534 --> 29:47.753
bracing screws 6 inches apart.
I'd say four.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.879
Pete.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.961
Shut up.

30:59.149 --> 31:02.779
My life may be a show. I may have
ridiculous oil paintings and insecurities,

31:02.903 --> 31:04.701
but you want me.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.789
I never said that.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.586
You just did.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.384
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.107
Lipstick.

31:39.398 --> 31:43.528
You're right. I screwed up.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.661
How bad is it?

31:45.821 --> 31:47.789
Go home. Talk to her there.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.961
You're after this, that
and the other thing.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.218
What's your end game?

31:59.376 --> 32:05.429
$757,432.86.

32:07.008 --> 32:10.808
That's a specific amount.
What does that buy?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.850
Freedom.

32:22.732 --> 32:25.531
We've got 45 minutes
to get this game off.

32:25.694 --> 32:29.790
Open up parking,
get people's asses in seats, ASAP.

32:30.782 --> 32:34.412
You city hall paper pushers
are lucky that this was just a game.

32:34.578 --> 32:39.049
This arena's an emergency evacuation
site. This could have been a disaster.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.175
It's more than just
the backup generator!

32:41.334 --> 32:45.714
The whole arena needs upgrades
and the benefits don't match the cost.

32:45.881 --> 32:50.136
I am building a new arena and let me tell
you something, it's not gonna be here.

32:50.260 --> 32:54.766
Either you let me into Hollywood
or I'm taking the Devils somewhere else.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.910
- The lights are on.
- Yeah.

33:07.903 --> 33:11.373
- I got to get to the arena for the game.
- Yeah, sure.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.078
Yeah, sure.

33:13.241 --> 33:18.042
So, do I need to...
Maybe I need to, or we need to...

33:18.205 --> 33:20.549
We don't need to.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.837
- We should probably just pretend...
- Right, yeah, agreed.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.008
It was nice, you know...

33:31.343 --> 33:33.721
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.813
Bye.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.250
All right, listen up.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.832
Twitter's gone fail whale with all
the jokes about our power going out.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.169
- We need to get in on the joke fast.
- How?

34:02.332 --> 34:06.132
We're going dark. I'm having facilities
set up black light as we speak

34:06.294 --> 34:08.797
and remember your marks
because if you miss one,

34:08.964 --> 34:10.762
you're breaking something.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.895
- Everything okay, Ahsha?
- I'm fine.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.931
I'm just not really feeling well.

34:18.098 --> 34:22.478
Oh, well, too bad your boyfriend's
not here. He always makes you smile.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.195
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:28.358 --> 34:33.455
please put your hands together
for the Los Angeles Devil Girls!

34:33.612 --> 34:36.411
Did somebody turn out the lights?

36:12.379 --> 36:15.007
Plans for the new Hollywood arena
are back in play.

36:16.216 --> 36:20.016
How? City said not a chance in hell.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.773
That was before I had
the backup generator disabled.

36:23.932 --> 36:27.982
Preparation plus opportunity
equals success.

36:32.941 --> 36:37.071
I'm hopeful
what this could mean for me.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.823
You should be.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.858
- How was the game?
- Good.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.612
I returned that bracelet.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.748
Good.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.548
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor...</i>

38:16.711 --> 38:18.679
I thought we were gonna stop this.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.299
You put me in a crappy spot.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.552
- You don't understand.
- Help me understand.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.937
The numbers came in for
the calendar shoot. They're huge.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.814
Oh, my God, is that Akon?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.941
- You're fired.
- He didn't just miss one game.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.023
- He didn't even get on the plane.
- What's going on?

38:33.144 --> 38:36.694
Having people to push you in the right
direction makes all the difference

38:36.856 --> 38:38.950
-and I feel like I have that person.
- Nice interview.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.906
- You ruined the rotation.
-Instead of riding me,

38:41.069 --> 38:42.491
why don't you focus on Terrence?

38:42.654 --> 38:45.453
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He wants to be traded.
