00:29.791 --> 00:35.250
NORWAY DECLARES NEUTRALITY
WHEN WORLD WAR II BREAKS OUT

00:42.958 --> 00:49.291
SWEDEN DELIVERS 85% OF THE IRON ORE
USED BY THE GERMAN WEAPONS INDUSTRY

00:50.125 --> 00:55.250
THE ORE IS TRANSPORTED BY TRAIN ACROSS
THE BORDER AND SHIPPED OUT FROM NARVIK

01:06.625 --> 01:12.041
GREAT BRITAIN CONSIDERS STOPPING THE ORE
TO BE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE

01:16.583 --> 01:20.500
ON APRIL 8 1940, THE BRITISH MARINE FORCE
MINE NORWEGIAN WATERS

01:21.583 --> 01:26.125
BRITISH AND NAZIS
LOAD ORE IN NORWAY SIDE BY SIDE

01:26.208 --> 01:30.333
BATTLE FOR IRON ORE
HECTIC DAYS AT PORT OF NARVIK

01:30.416 --> 01:35.625
THAT DAY, A TROOP OF NORWEGIAN SOLDIERS
ARE SENT TO NARVIK AS NEUTRALITY GUARDS

01:36.125 --> 01:41.250
THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT NORWAY'S
NEUTRALITY HAS ALREADY BEEN BREACHED

02:17.208 --> 02:18.208
Do you smell that?

02:22.875 --> 02:24.166
Yes, now I got it!

02:24.250 --> 02:26.500
-Got what?
-The smell.

02:27.875 --> 02:28.958
Saltwater?

02:29.708 --> 02:31.083
There's something more.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.500
You don't smell it?

02:37.708 --> 02:38.666
Nope.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.958
Then you're not a local.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.791
It's ore. Iron ore.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.291
The smell of money.

02:56.041 --> 02:58.375
Soldiers, listen up.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.208
All leave is cancelled.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.375
Captain?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.500
It's my son's birthday.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.791
Everyone must go to the camp.

03:22.791 --> 03:25.625
Corporal, be back by midnight.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.583
Thank you, major.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.291
Take this.

03:41.541 --> 03:43.250
How did you manage that?

03:43.333 --> 03:45.583
-I'm not a donkey.
-Don't make me order you.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.500
Give Bjorg my best.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.000
Bjorg?

03:51.083 --> 03:52.500
Do you know who you are?

03:52.583 --> 03:54.000
I'm coming!

04:08.208 --> 04:09.666
Our ore…

04:09.750 --> 04:13.541
contains more iron than any other.

04:13.625 --> 04:14.708
That's why

04:14.791 --> 04:18.000
it is sought after, all over the world.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.625
Today, when we present the plans
for our new ore wharf,

04:21.708 --> 04:24.750
you can see for yourselves,

04:24.833 --> 04:27.083
that there is enough room for you all.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.375
I can guarantee it.

04:30.791 --> 04:33.666
German and English industry

04:33.750 --> 04:38.208
have one thing in common
with us here in little Narvik.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.625
You all profit

04:39.708 --> 04:41.958
greatly from the peace

04:42.041 --> 04:44.791
-and security of our harbour.
-Security of

04:44.875 --> 04:46.166
our harbour.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.875
-And we are happy about that.
-And--

04:48.750 --> 04:51.083
But unfortunately,
it has come to my attention

04:51.166 --> 04:52.000
that several ships,

04:53.041 --> 04:55.791
both German and English,

04:55.875 --> 04:56.916
have been sunk

04:57.500 --> 04:59.416
-…after leaving port.
-Excuse me.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.750
This affects all of us.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.125
Since there are representatives

05:05.208 --> 05:08.750
from both English and German
authorities here today,

05:09.333 --> 05:10.833
I would ask you

05:10.916 --> 05:13.583
to speak with your governments
about an agreement

05:13.666 --> 05:16.541
which guarantees safe passage

05:16.625 --> 05:17.791
for all ships

05:17.875 --> 05:19.958
of all nations.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.833
…so that the ore
makes it safely to its destination.

05:25.916 --> 05:26.833
Well…

05:27.666 --> 05:29.708
Your mayor thinks too highly of me.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.000
Consul Wussow.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.958
-Cheers!
-Let me refill your drink.

05:34.041 --> 05:34.875
To Narvik!

05:35.791 --> 05:36.666
Consul Ross.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.416
Cheers.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.333
To Narvik!

05:40.416 --> 05:42.041
-To Narvik!
-To Narvik!

05:58.291 --> 05:59.666
Hansen says, "Hi!"

06:00.791 --> 06:02.291
Say, "Hi!" back.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.125
You're finished now, right?

06:08.083 --> 06:09.166
Soon.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.583
We were transferred to the town today.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.541
Did they say why?

06:15.958 --> 06:18.250
So I can be close to you, of course.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.666
Hello! We have to serve.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.833
Yes.

06:25.666 --> 06:27.791
Someone is going to be happy to see you.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.458
Yes? Where is he?

06:29.541 --> 06:31.291
Outside, with your dad.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.208
Ingrid?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.791
I have to be back by midnight.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.083
You can't leave until I finish work.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.333
So hurry.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.458
Are you ready?

07:02.833 --> 07:03.750
And one more.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.208
Look who's coming.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.458
Daddy!

07:16.833 --> 07:18.666
Hey. You…

07:18.750 --> 07:20.833
-You're as heavy as a five-year old.
-I'm six.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.125
Are you six?

07:22.291 --> 07:24.041
Then this must be for you.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.250
A locomotive!

07:29.333 --> 07:30.375
A locomotive.

07:34.458 --> 07:35.708
How are you?

07:37.625 --> 07:38.708
I'm fine.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.458
Let me see.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.000
Is it nice?

08:23.208 --> 08:24.708
So Gunnar is back?

08:24.791 --> 08:27.500
Only for tonight.
So I came to ask if I could…

08:27.583 --> 08:30.500
<i>Reuters has been informed</i>
<i>from authoritative sources in London</i>

08:30.583 --> 08:33.625
<i>that the mining in Norwegian waters</i>
<i>was completed in one hour,</i>

08:34.208 --> 08:36.791
<i>without involvement from any others,</i>
<i>it has said.</i>

08:36.875 --> 08:38.333
Thank God we have the English.

08:38.416 --> 08:41.250
<i>During the afternoon and night,</i>
<i>there have been reports of the torpedoing</i>

08:41.333 --> 08:44.916
<i>of three German ships</i>
<i>off the Norwegian coast.</i>

08:45.000 --> 08:47.625
<i>Both warring parties have…</i>

08:47.708 --> 08:50.541
Someone has to put a stop to that Hitler.

08:51.958 --> 08:52.833
<i>This was the news.</i>

08:57.041 --> 08:59.791
He wanted to finish building.
I didn't have the heart to…

09:08.291 --> 09:10.750
I'll take Ole and go to bed.

09:11.708 --> 09:12.875
Thank you.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.875
-Good night.
-Good night.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.041
Good night.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.166
By the way, as I told Ingrid,

09:34.958 --> 09:37.250
I'm happy to make up a bunkbed.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.291
Good night, Dad.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.833
-Good night.
-Good night.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.708
Hey.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.875
I have to leave

09:46.958 --> 09:49.083
-in half an hour.
-I know.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.500
I know. We have time.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.916
He's the one talking about the bunkbed.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.708
Gunnar?

11:03.333 --> 11:05.041
-Did you hear that?
-No.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.958
No. You have no idea
how much trouble I'm in.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.000
I should have been back there
over four hours ago.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.708
You can blame me.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.916
-When are you back?
-Tonight.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.875
Unless I'm arrested.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.166
I love you.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.750
Take care of yourself.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.791
Colonel, sir.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.916
Why aren't you armed?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.291
I've…

11:55.000 --> 11:56.375
I've been on leave.

11:56.958 --> 11:58.958
I'm supposed to defend the town with this?

12:00.541 --> 12:02.375
Our ships

12:02.458 --> 12:03.541
have been sunk.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.833
Marines scattered all over the harbor.

12:07.916 --> 12:12.125
<i>German warships passed</i>
<i>the Oslofjord fortress tonight</i>

12:12.208 --> 12:14.583
<i>after engaging</i>
<i>with the fortress' batteries,</i>

12:14.666 --> 12:16.375
<i>and continued onwards.</i>

12:16.458 --> 12:19.500
<i>German warships have also,</i>
<i>while battling the fortress,</i>

12:19.583 --> 12:22.708
<i>entered Bergen, which is now occupied.</i>

12:23.416 --> 12:26.125
<i>One ship has entered Narvik,</i>

12:26.208 --> 12:29.791
<i>most likely after a battle</i>
<i>with Norwegian vessels,</i>

12:29.875 --> 12:32.583
<i>and landed a smaller force.</i>

12:32.666 --> 12:34.416
<i>No further details.</i>

12:35.333 --> 12:37.083
Has a ship really been sunk?

12:43.291 --> 12:45.416
-Magne? Where's my equipment?
-What?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.833
Where's my equipment?

12:46.916 --> 12:48.541
Back at camp.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.208
In position and awaiting your order.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.416
Withdraw!

13:03.125 --> 13:04.625
Or we will shoot!

13:04.708 --> 13:06.708
That is not going to happen!

13:10.458 --> 13:11.833
-What are you doing?
-I'm coming with.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.958
No! I'm doing this alone.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.291
Pull yourself together.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.083
So many dead.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.750
Was that really necessary?

13:32.375 --> 13:34.125
We warned the ships.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.333
They refused to surrender.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.125
We have control over every town in Norway.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.375
You don't stand a chance.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.541
I thought that you…

13:49.458 --> 13:52.500
had accepted an agreement.
Or did I misunderstand?

13:57.041 --> 13:58.041
I got it.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.833
I can't believe it.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.625
Pull back!

14:24.375 --> 14:26.375
Colonel, this is in violation of…

14:26.458 --> 14:28.833
I can't have the town blown

14:28.916 --> 14:30.041
to pieces.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.541
Are we not going to fight?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.625
Are we letting them just take it?

14:43.708 --> 14:44.958
Where we going now?

14:57.458 --> 15:00.416
Okay. Let's take a left here, boys.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.375
Are we not going back to camp?

15:03.458 --> 15:05.625
Not a cat in hell's chance.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.250
Are we not?

15:11.333 --> 15:12.375
What's going on?

15:16.041 --> 15:18.666
I'm going home.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.250
Where are you going?

15:30.375 --> 15:32.583
You know what the Germans to do POWs?

15:33.625 --> 15:34.708
They shoot them.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.041
Magne!

15:39.125 --> 15:40.041
What are you doing?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.125
You're a soldier, damn it.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.833
That one, too! Put him with the others!

16:33.750 --> 16:36.166
That one, too! Put him with the others!

16:36.250 --> 16:37.625
Down!

16:37.708 --> 16:39.375
To the reception desk!

16:39.458 --> 16:40.583
Keep moving!

16:40.666 --> 16:42.666
-Get out!
-Come on, hurry!

16:44.875 --> 16:45.875
This way.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.458
Get down, down!

16:49.541 --> 16:52.541
-Give me the Englishman's keys!
-Come on, hurry up!

16:52.625 --> 16:54.708
-Down, down! To the reception desk.
-One moment.

16:54.791 --> 16:56.291
One second! I need this young lady.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.333
As a translator.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.333
Mrs. Tofte, could you help us?

16:59.416 --> 17:01.041
ROYAL HOTEL

17:01.125 --> 17:03.375
We urgently need the key to room 503.

17:04.041 --> 17:05.625
They want Ross' key.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.375
We don't give out guests' keys.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.708
I'm sorry,
there is only one key for each room.

17:09.791 --> 17:13.208
Yes. And one that fits everywhere.
The master key.

17:13.708 --> 17:15.083
-The key! Now!
-No.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.958
No, no. We come here as friends.

17:18.041 --> 17:21.541
To protect Norway from the English.
So please be careful with your weapon.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.166
I understand.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.708
You do? Good.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.125
But my husband is a soldier.

17:33.625 --> 17:34.458
Down at the harbor?

17:35.958 --> 17:36.916
No.

17:37.708 --> 17:41.375
The Norwegian Army
has laid down their arms.

17:41.458 --> 17:42.958
That means he's safe.

17:52.125 --> 17:53.125
Thank you.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.291
Walter, You're coming with me.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.500
Alright, we'd like
to take over all the rooms.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.916
He wants all the rooms.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.458
What about the guests?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.750
The guests who need to move out
will be compensated, of course.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.041
One…

18:08.791 --> 18:09.958
Two…

18:10.041 --> 18:12.250
That should be enough for now.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.583
And you will get a pay raise.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.750
No. No, thanks.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.541
-That's not necessary.
-Of course it is.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.083
I need someone who

18:22.166 --> 18:24.458
appreciates the value of cooperation
and who speaks German.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.291
Excuse me.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.625
Go help Bjorg in the kitchen,
people need breakfast.

18:31.708 --> 18:34.208
Did I do something wrong?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.208
No, you didn't. They were taking
the keys no matter what,

18:38.291 --> 18:40.083
and we cannot control this conflict.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.416
We have a hotel to run.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.666
Halt! Stop there!

19:02.541 --> 19:04.333
Keep marching.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.458
What is going on, soldier?

19:13.541 --> 19:15.666
You're not allowed to leave town.

19:16.666 --> 19:17.708
Why?

19:17.791 --> 19:20.458
You have to turn around
and go back to the barracks.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.041
You are not allowed to march here.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.583
Yes.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
We march.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.333
Let them through?

19:43.875 --> 19:45.250
I'm ready. Should I shoot?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.125
Eyes forward.

20:03.666 --> 20:05.041
What should we do?

20:05.125 --> 20:06.833
The Germans are out back.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.541
Open the door at once!

20:12.500 --> 20:13.750
Open up!

20:15.458 --> 20:16.541
Hello?

20:17.333 --> 20:18.291
Open the door right now!

20:19.583 --> 20:20.625
We know you're in there!

20:22.166 --> 20:24.333
There you go. Did you not hear us?

20:25.416 --> 20:26.333
Move.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.500
-Good morning.
-Morning.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.833
Please follow me.

20:38.666 --> 20:40.041
The coffee is ready.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.500
Milk or sugar?

20:58.750 --> 20:59.833
Milk, please.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.000
For me too.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.583
-Soldiers!
-Come.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.750
Everyone gather…

21:26.875 --> 21:28.166
I didn't know what to say.

21:52.250 --> 21:53.583
What about the hunting cabin?

21:54.666 --> 21:56.083
In the mountains?

22:24.125 --> 22:25.166
We have to leave town.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.666
Should I bring my boots?

22:26.750 --> 22:28.500
Bring your boots.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.125
Have you heard what happened?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.208
What about Gunnar?

22:32.291 --> 22:33.750
He's left already.

22:33.833 --> 22:34.833
No.

22:35.583 --> 22:37.333
The Norwegian soldiers
are here, in Narvik.

22:37.416 --> 22:38.708
They've surrendered.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.333
There's a company
on its way along the tracks.

22:43.791 --> 22:45.333
And Gunnar is among them?

22:46.750 --> 22:48.291
You think Gunnar would surrender?

23:26.791 --> 23:28.166
You didn't make it back to camp yesterday?

23:28.833 --> 23:30.500
He was too busy driving the toy train.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.541
The ferry is closed. Go back home.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.291
We're just standing here
gawking like idiots.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.541
Do you think he's Norwegian?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.458
Grandpa told me that they're from

23:53.541 --> 23:56.291
the Norwegian ships sunk by the Germans.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.333
What's happening?

24:00.416 --> 24:02.250
The ferry is closed for civilians.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.625
No one is allowed to leave the town.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.791
If the Germans think
they can close off the city,

24:07.875 --> 24:09.791
they'll get a surprise.

24:13.541 --> 24:14.583
Ole.

24:15.375 --> 24:16.416
Come.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.000
Don't look.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.208
Did you get more?

24:31.291 --> 24:32.708
Corporal Tofte.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.458
The major wants to see you.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.208
Straight to jail.

24:44.458 --> 24:45.666
It must be written somewhere.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.916
Yes, it must.

24:47.583 --> 24:49.333
We might be missing a page.

24:49.416 --> 24:50.791
Corporal Tofte reporting.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.125
Yes.

24:52.916 --> 24:55.208
I understand you've worked
on the Ofoten line?

24:56.125 --> 24:57.333
Yes, I have.

24:58.125 --> 25:01.416
-When I don't have neutrality duty, sir.
-We are no longer neutral.

25:01.916 --> 25:05.708
According to this plan, there
should be some dynamite here. Where is it?

25:08.541 --> 25:09.916
I don't know, sir.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.291
This bridge was made
to be able to be blown up,

25:12.375 --> 25:14.166
so there must be dynamite here.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.791
Tofte! Telephone for you.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.333
Tofte.

25:38.291 --> 25:39.375
Dad?

25:40.125 --> 25:41.291
Can we speak freely?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.083
I can speak freely.

25:45.958 --> 25:46.916
Where are you, Gunnar?

25:48.916 --> 25:51.791
Do you know of any dynamite
stored here by the Nordal Bridge?

25:53.750 --> 25:54.833
There's a stash

25:54.916 --> 25:57.625
in the tunnel facing Sweden.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.333
In the tunnel on this side?

25:59.416 --> 26:02.416
Yes. The chamber is in the third pillar.

26:02.916 --> 26:04.333
You'll need…

26:04.416 --> 26:06.416
three, four sticks in each chamber.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.750
I know, Dad.

26:07.833 --> 26:08.708
Gunnar, listen.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.833
There's a train coming up the tracks.

26:12.416 --> 26:14.500
And Ole and Ingrid are on it…

26:16.583 --> 26:18.458
So you are competent with explosives?

26:18.541 --> 26:19.916
Yes, major.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.333
Bring your team, plant the dynamite,
and detonate immediately.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.458
Shouldn't we let the train pass first?

26:28.666 --> 26:31.375
Do you understand
why we're blowing up this bridge?

26:31.458 --> 26:33.958
To keep the iron ore
from reaching Narvik, sir.

26:34.041 --> 26:35.666
The only reason the Germans are here,

26:35.750 --> 26:38.333
is so they can use that ore
for their armored steel.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.208
-I understand.
-Yes.

26:40.291 --> 26:44.125
Then you know we can't risk the train
having German alpine troops onboard.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.125
EXPLOSIVES - DANGER

26:57.333 --> 26:58.541
Right.

26:58.625 --> 26:59.916
Is this enough?

27:00.958 --> 27:02.708
That's all there was, major.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.208
Movement in the tunnel!

27:06.291 --> 27:08.583
Positions! Blast it right away.

27:10.416 --> 27:12.041
To cover. Cover.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.708
The chamber
is at the bottom of the third pillar!

27:24.375 --> 27:26.833
Fire on my command!

27:46.833 --> 27:48.291
They're civilians.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.291
Yes.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.083
They're civilians.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.791
Don't shoot!

28:02.125 --> 28:03.416
Daddy!

28:04.500 --> 28:06.041
Stay there, Grethe!

28:07.875 --> 28:10.333
Get the civilians over the bridge.
Over here. Quick!

28:22.500 --> 28:24.916
Get off the bridge! Come on!

28:25.000 --> 28:26.041
Quick!

28:33.166 --> 28:34.041
-Ole!
-Daddy!

28:36.500 --> 28:38.833
Get off the bridge. It's gonna blow.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.333
What happened to the train?

28:46.416 --> 28:48.000
The Germans stopped it,

28:48.083 --> 28:49.500
in Hundalen.

28:49.583 --> 28:50.875
Where are they now?

28:50.958 --> 28:52.625
I don't know.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.750
They stayed at the station when we left.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.875
In the tunnel.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.000
Get in the tunnel.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.083
Just follow the tracks.

29:02.166 --> 29:03.958
You're almost in Sweden after that tunnel.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.208
What happens to you?

29:05.291 --> 29:07.500
Corporal! We've got to blast it.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.125
-Yes, major.
-Now!

29:10.333 --> 29:12.000
Run, Ole!

29:12.083 --> 29:12.916
We're right behind.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.333
-Are you?
-Yes!

29:14.416 --> 29:16.875
Fire on my command!

29:23.166 --> 29:25.750
I told you to use the chambers.

29:25.833 --> 29:26.708
Those?

29:31.250 --> 29:32.541
There's no point.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.333
Then we don't have enough dynamite.

29:37.583 --> 29:38.875
What else can we do?

29:41.541 --> 29:42.875
We need a charge up there.

29:47.625 --> 29:50.625
-Attach the rest to the other side.
-Yes.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.166
Come.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.416
I don't want to, I want to wait for daddy.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.916
You heard what daddy said,
he's right behind us.

30:20.750 --> 30:21.875
Ole!

30:39.041 --> 30:40.208
Ole!

30:41.916 --> 30:43.791
-Ole!
-Yes.

30:52.916 --> 30:54.291
Corporal, hurry up!

30:59.125 --> 31:00.125
Shoot!

31:05.625 --> 31:08.166
Don't think. Aim.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.458
Blow it now!

31:13.083 --> 31:14.875
Magne, catch!

31:51.541 --> 31:52.625
Bring those two.

31:53.416 --> 31:54.333
Run!

31:57.375 --> 31:59.291
Gunnar, get off the bridge!

32:17.125 --> 32:18.208
The fuse is lit!

32:18.916 --> 32:20.750
Pull back!

32:26.583 --> 32:28.583
Go, go! Across the bridge!

32:28.666 --> 32:30.833
Go! Move it! Get over the bridge!

32:31.458 --> 32:32.541
After them!

32:34.916 --> 32:35.875
After them!

33:15.416 --> 33:17.041
Is daddy coming now?

33:28.083 --> 33:29.416
Are you alone?

33:30.541 --> 33:32.458
Yes, we're alone.

33:32.541 --> 33:33.875
Come with us.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.958
You miserable saboteurs.
You'll regret this.

33:42.958 --> 33:44.000
Move along!

33:45.541 --> 33:47.166
Damn Norwegian pig.

33:48.416 --> 33:50.041
What's happening to them?

33:50.125 --> 33:52.333
They're prisoners of war.

33:52.416 --> 33:55.166
They'll get their punishment.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.875
They blew up the bridge.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.750
Stop gawking.

34:12.666 --> 34:14.250
What are you gawking at? Eyes forward.

34:15.041 --> 34:16.416
Keep going, please.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.541
-Grandpa!
-Ole!

34:43.625 --> 34:45.416
Seeing you has made Grandpa happy.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.333
What happened?

34:47.416 --> 34:51.208
Daddy blew up the bridge
so it's all crooked.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.666
Did the bridge get all crooked and weird?

34:55.291 --> 34:56.958
Stay right here. Understood?

34:57.750 --> 34:58.833
Is daddy okay?

34:59.541 --> 35:00.750
-Yes.
-Mrs. Tofte?

35:01.833 --> 35:04.000
Consul Wussow wants to see you.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.208
Yes.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.458
Mrs. Tofte. Thank you for coming.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.916
We're having trouble with the mayor.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.708
We need to evacuate.

35:28.791 --> 35:30.208
-Evacuate?
-Yes.

35:30.291 --> 35:32.500
We are here to protect you.

35:32.583 --> 35:35.666
Oh, to protect us?
But many Norwegians are dead!

35:35.750 --> 35:37.666
Your men had the opportunity

35:37.750 --> 35:39.916
to surrender, and they chose not to.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.291
What… Ingrid, he might understand
what I'm saying, but not what I mean.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.666
-We need to evacuate.
-Yes.

35:44.750 --> 35:48.416
Mr. Mayor, let's start from the top again.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.416
You tried to send a telegraph?

35:50.500 --> 35:52.166
What did you want to achieve by it?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.291
You tried to telegraph, and…

35:54.375 --> 35:55.208
they want to know

35:55.291 --> 35:56.166
-what you want to achieve.
-Yes.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.458
I've already told you,

35:57.541 --> 35:59.083
I wanted to warn the British.

35:59.166 --> 36:00.750
He wanted to warn the British.

36:00.833 --> 36:02.166
Warn them.

36:02.250 --> 36:04.083
-About what?
-About what?

36:04.166 --> 36:05.833
The town is full of civilians.

36:05.916 --> 36:07.583
That the town is full of civilians.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.750
Yes.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.541
Which Englishman did he talk to?

36:11.625 --> 36:13.791
He asks who you were in contact with.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.666
No one, I didn't get that far.

36:15.750 --> 36:16.625
None.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.666
Yes. If you refuse to let us evacuate,

36:19.750 --> 36:22.500
we'll be forced to use
the pedestrian tunnel as a shelter.

36:22.583 --> 36:25.125
We have a long tunnel that the mayor

36:25.208 --> 36:27.541
wants to use as an air-raid shelter.

36:27.625 --> 36:29.041
The English aren't coming.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.208
Ok. Then why do we need your protection?

36:32.291 --> 36:34.166
Then why do you want to protect us?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.458
The English won't come
because we are here.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.083
The English won't come
as long as the Germans are here.

36:39.166 --> 36:42.416
For the good of your people,
we should cooperate.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.166
Oh, cooperate?

36:44.250 --> 36:47.250
Our neutrality has been violated!

36:48.916 --> 36:50.500
I'm not done with you yet.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.750
No. You can tell him
I have another errand.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.333
We need the mayor
to keep the town running.

36:55.416 --> 36:56.958
May I try again?

37:01.750 --> 37:02.958
One more thing.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.791
He's temperamental,
but can be reasoned with.

37:06.416 --> 37:08.041
Get the man under control.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.541
We need 50 skilled workers.

37:16.208 --> 37:17.583
See to it.

37:17.666 --> 37:19.791
Go home and try to get some rest.

37:20.583 --> 37:21.500
Yes.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.750
Everything okay?

37:35.250 --> 37:37.875
My husband was captured
on the Nordal Bridge.

37:38.416 --> 37:39.250
Yes.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.708
I… I fear for his life.

37:45.875 --> 37:48.666
You have the wrong idea about us,
Mrs. Tofte.

37:48.750 --> 37:49.916
We aren't like that.

37:52.333 --> 37:53.833
But…

37:53.916 --> 37:55.125
he was one of those

37:56.291 --> 37:57.916
who blew up the bridge

38:00.041 --> 38:01.125
I see.

38:05.791 --> 38:08.000
I will ask General Dietl about it.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.041
Thank you.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.458
Would you do that?

38:12.541 --> 38:13.625
Of course.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.625
I will emphasize
how important your work is to us.

38:17.208 --> 38:18.541
His name is

38:18.625 --> 38:19.666
Gunnar Tofte.

38:20.583 --> 38:21.791
Okay.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.000
Thank you.

38:31.083 --> 38:32.083
That's it.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.958
It's Bjorg.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.083
-Oh
-It's moving!

38:46.458 --> 38:47.625
Go on in.

38:50.166 --> 38:51.166
Wait.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.250
Sorry to intrude.

38:57.458 --> 39:00.000
It's our friends from room 503.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.833
They've asked you to visit.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.416
-What do they want?
-For you to bring this.

39:08.083 --> 39:09.625
Why can't you do it?

39:10.208 --> 39:11.791
They insisted on you,

39:11.875 --> 39:13.250
and that it had to be today.

39:17.875 --> 39:20.583
No, they'll be fine without tobacco.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.333
If you don't help, it becomes my problem.

39:27.458 --> 39:29.500
You're the one who told me
to walk them to the cabin.

39:29.583 --> 39:31.333
You can't just dump everything on me.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.291
Good morning, General Dietl.
Your car is ready.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.750
Drive me down to the pier,
I'm meeting with Admiral Bontar.

39:43.833 --> 39:45.125
Yes, sir.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.708
The attaché is here already.

39:49.583 --> 39:50.625
General.

42:45.625 --> 42:46.458
Put it over here.

42:47.125 --> 42:48.791
But when it has been restored
and the trains are running again,

42:49.541 --> 42:51.250
we're faced with the next problem:

42:52.083 --> 42:54.958
the harbor, mines and line
need to be operational.

42:55.041 --> 42:56.666
There are volunteers.

42:56.750 --> 42:57.833
See to it,

42:57.916 --> 42:59.125
use all your channels.

42:59.208 --> 43:01.666
People must know that
everything will keep going like before.

43:01.750 --> 43:04.541
Everything will keep going as usual.
People should go to work.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.416
Nothing has changed,
everything goes on as normal.

43:11.875 --> 43:12.875
Thank you.

43:22.708 --> 43:24.333
English war ships are in the fjord!

43:24.416 --> 43:26.208
They're attacking, General.

43:26.291 --> 43:29.375
I thought the German fleet
had everything under control?

43:33.333 --> 43:34.250
Why weren't we warned?

43:49.916 --> 43:52.166
Aslak! Basement!

43:57.458 --> 43:59.166
Are the English bad too?

43:59.250 --> 44:00.375
No.

44:00.458 --> 44:02.416
They've come to help us.

44:02.916 --> 44:05.750
-Come on, Dag!
-Down to the basement.

44:10.333 --> 44:12.208
All men to the dock!

44:12.291 --> 44:14.583
All together! Now go!

44:21.958 --> 44:25.875
All together!

44:26.750 --> 44:29.750
Come on!

44:29.833 --> 44:32.291
Faster!

44:56.375 --> 44:58.000
Ole, come here.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.333
There.

45:31.875 --> 45:33.333
I have to pee.

45:34.583 --> 45:35.666
Pee?

45:50.041 --> 45:52.291
I don't want to pee.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.958
It's perfectly normal to pee.

45:58.958 --> 46:02.458
If you get really scared, you have
to hurry or you'll pee your pants.

46:02.541 --> 46:04.750
Are the Germans peeing their pants now?

46:04.833 --> 46:05.791
I'm sure they are.

46:06.916 --> 46:08.500
Hitler too.

46:08.583 --> 46:10.250
<i>Hitler he cheated</i>

46:10.333 --> 46:12.708
<i>He peed in his pants</i>

47:02.875 --> 47:05.000
If I know Polly,

47:05.083 --> 47:07.583
she's readied the rooms
for the English already.

47:07.666 --> 47:09.500
Is Daddy coming too?

47:10.791 --> 47:12.833
Yes, but maybe not right away.

47:12.916 --> 47:13.958
Oh, okay.

47:21.375 --> 47:22.875
Is it the English?

47:22.958 --> 47:25.208
No, they haven't come ashore yet,
and I don't understand why.

47:26.291 --> 47:28.000
They've sunk all the German ships.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.250
Ingrid, we need help out here.

47:35.333 --> 47:36.416
Okay.

47:37.375 --> 47:39.625
Stop helping the Germans.

47:39.708 --> 47:41.666
This is my job, Aslak.

47:41.750 --> 47:44.375
It's best if you go home
and wait for the English.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.541
You go ahead, I'll come later.

47:49.750 --> 47:50.916
Yes, like that.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.708
He's got severe burns,
so clean the wounds please,

47:53.791 --> 47:55.625
apply some ointment and bandages.

47:55.708 --> 47:58.416
-Yes. We must clean it and apply bandages.
-Okay.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.375
And it's the same for him.

48:00.458 --> 48:02.750
Could your colleague take care of it?

48:08.041 --> 48:09.541
It's mainly up here.

48:12.083 --> 48:14.875
I've got cars to take them
to the military hospital.

48:14.958 --> 48:17.000
Good. We'll take
the most seriously injured first.

48:17.083 --> 48:18.208
Okay.

48:19.750 --> 48:21.166
I need all their names.

48:22.375 --> 48:25.708
Mrs. Tofte, could the rest of them
spend the night here?

48:26.625 --> 48:29.208
Have you spoken to General Dietl?

48:29.291 --> 48:30.791
No. I'm afraid he's not here.

48:31.666 --> 48:33.541
When will he be back?

48:33.625 --> 48:35.666
You need to be careful.

48:35.750 --> 48:37.583
The general is under a lot of pressure.

48:37.666 --> 48:38.708
What does that mean?

48:40.666 --> 48:42.833
It's the wrong time

48:42.916 --> 48:44.833
to tell him that your husband was there

48:44.916 --> 48:46.333
when they blew up the bridge.

48:47.625 --> 48:48.666
I understand.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.958
Polly!

48:56.041 --> 48:57.125
I'll get more blankets.

51:17.541 --> 51:19.041
Stop complaining.

51:19.125 --> 51:20.291
Halt!

51:22.750 --> 51:24.166
You know there's a curfew?

51:24.250 --> 51:27.208
-I… I have to get home.
-May I see your papers?

51:27.291 --> 51:28.375
Yes.

51:39.250 --> 51:40.958
Uh, one moment.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.208
There.

51:59.166 --> 52:00.791
Everything's in order. Go on.

52:00.875 --> 52:01.875
Thank you.

52:12.291 --> 52:14.541
Direct hit!

52:15.041 --> 52:17.125
Everyone out of the building!

52:19.166 --> 52:20.375
Put out the fire!

52:32.083 --> 52:35.791
Pray for your lives!

52:56.791 --> 52:59.666
Ole!

53:01.791 --> 53:04.958
Ole!

53:08.166 --> 53:09.083
No!

53:12.291 --> 53:13.708
Aslak!

53:22.833 --> 53:24.250
Ole!

53:25.750 --> 53:27.541
-Ole!
-Yes…

53:39.166 --> 53:41.375
Mommy.

53:41.458 --> 53:42.458
I'm bleeding.

53:46.041 --> 53:47.208
Hey.

53:53.166 --> 53:56.458
ROASME, 4 WEEKS LATER

54:01.833 --> 54:08.833
THE GERMANS HAVE ESTABLISHED
AN IRON RING AROUND NARVIK

54:10.166 --> 54:16.750
FRENCH AND POLISH TROOPS HAVE DISEMBARKED
TO ATTACK FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH

54:18.291 --> 54:25.291
FIRST THE NORWEGIANS MUST NEUTRALIZE
THE GERMAN POSITIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.791
Don't fall behind!

55:11.708 --> 55:13.250
Get him back up, damn it!

55:13.958 --> 55:15.125
We have to keep going!

55:15.208 --> 55:16.208
Get up.

55:18.416 --> 55:19.625
Get him up!

55:21.708 --> 55:23.250
Pathetic Norwegians.

55:23.333 --> 55:24.458
Come on.

55:26.166 --> 55:27.750
If you can't get him up…

55:27.833 --> 55:29.166
Think about that girl you love.

55:29.250 --> 55:30.583
…I'll shoot him.

55:31.291 --> 55:32.625
At the hotel.

55:33.583 --> 55:35.875
-Bjorg has forgotten about me.
-Don't be silly.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.083
-She remembers you.
-Magne, Bjorg is in love with you.

55:40.250 --> 55:42.250
Ingrid told me.

55:48.958 --> 55:49.958
Come on!

55:50.833 --> 55:51.833
Move!

56:05.333 --> 56:06.916
What else did she say?

56:08.833 --> 56:10.875
Bjørg talks about you,

56:10.958 --> 56:12.041
every day.

56:13.500 --> 56:14.583
She's waiting for you.

56:15.416 --> 56:17.208
For you to come home.

57:07.750 --> 57:09.125
Shut up.

57:09.208 --> 57:10.833
-Thank you.
-He already had some.

57:14.916 --> 57:16.625
It gets worse if you stare.

57:27.708 --> 57:29.166
What's going to happen to us?

57:30.791 --> 57:31.791
Move it!

57:32.666 --> 57:33.666
BOFORS MORTARS

57:37.416 --> 57:38.833
Look what we are carrying.

57:39.625 --> 57:41.041
Bofors ammunition.

57:44.291 --> 57:46.458
How many dead Norwegians
in this box, you think?

57:57.750 --> 57:59.083
Grenades!

58:01.541 --> 58:04.166
Get ready to leave!

58:04.250 --> 58:05.458
Get the wounded!

58:05.541 --> 58:08.125
The wounded to HQ!

58:08.208 --> 58:10.416
Get up, come on.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.750
Faster!

58:11.833 --> 58:13.375
Go! Faster!

58:13.458 --> 58:14.458
Where are we going?

58:14.541 --> 58:16.375
To HQ, by the railway line.

58:16.458 --> 58:18.333
Why is this taking so long?

58:18.416 --> 58:20.958
To your position!

58:21.041 --> 58:22.375
Go!

58:23.041 --> 58:23.875
There!

58:23.958 --> 58:25.416
Yes, to the side.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.375
Be careful.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.458
How careful do you think
the Germans are with us?

58:32.791 --> 58:34.458
How did that

58:34.541 --> 58:35.708
story go again?

58:36.500 --> 58:39.750
That guy who got his head smashed in
while the grandkid watched.

58:39.833 --> 58:41.541
The one from Narvik?

58:41.625 --> 58:44.208
-Tollefsen.
-No, Tofte.

58:45.791 --> 58:48.666
How careful do you think
the Germans were with his head?

58:49.500 --> 58:51.041
Tofte, you said?

58:53.583 --> 58:54.666
Gunnar.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.833
Go!

59:05.916 --> 59:07.666
Go, go! To our positions!

59:09.416 --> 59:11.250
Get the injured out, quickly!

59:11.333 --> 59:13.250
Get out! Go!

59:14.916 --> 59:16.875
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

59:16.958 --> 59:18.583
Go, faster!

59:18.666 --> 59:20.875
Get in here.

59:23.166 --> 59:24.416
What happened to the kid?

59:24.500 --> 59:26.916
-Tofte. Is the grandkid alive?
-I don't know.

59:34.041 --> 59:35.458
Get up!

59:36.375 --> 59:37.500
Stop!

59:38.583 --> 59:39.708
Gunnar!

59:42.541 --> 59:43.666
Stop right there!

59:58.708 --> 1:00:00.000
It's okay, come on.

1:00:00.083 --> 1:00:02.250
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1:00:02.958 --> 1:00:04.666
Gunnar, we have to leave.

1:00:05.666 --> 1:00:07.000
Let's run.

1:00:08.416 --> 1:00:09.583
Look out!

1:00:15.208 --> 1:00:17.291
Come on, Goddamn it. Come on--

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:29.791
Shit.

1:00:31.291 --> 1:00:32.375
Here.

1:00:32.458 --> 1:00:33.625
Let's go.

1:01:03.791 --> 1:01:05.291
-Look out!
-they’re coming from the left

1:01:05.375 --> 1:01:07.750
Machine gun!

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:11.583
To the left.

1:01:11.666 --> 1:01:12.791
To the right.

1:01:38.083 --> 1:01:39.541
It's Pierre!

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:42.291
It's okay, guys.

1:01:43.208 --> 1:01:45.125
-Who's he?
-It's okay.

1:01:45.208 --> 1:01:46.250
He's with us.

1:01:47.625 --> 1:01:49.041
Ah, thank you.

1:01:50.666 --> 1:01:53.000
Well done. Pierre.

1:01:54.458 --> 1:01:56.750
-Gunnar.
-You're welcome.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.416
Come, let’s go. We have to go.

1:02:17.583 --> 1:02:19.250
Why the hell are you here?

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:24.708
Norwegian?

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:35.166
Are you injured?

1:02:36.416 --> 1:02:37.541
No.

1:03:11.083 --> 1:03:12.750
-Bring it down right away.
-Yes.

1:03:15.916 --> 1:03:17.916
The Germans have fled the mountain.

1:03:19.666 --> 1:03:20.541
Major.

1:03:20.625 --> 1:03:21.833
Something to report?

1:03:21.916 --> 1:03:23.875
Two dead Germans at the machine gun post.

1:03:24.791 --> 1:03:26.541
Both shot by Corporal Tofte.

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:28.500
Yes.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.333
The guy who told you that story,
is he here?

1:03:31.416 --> 1:03:32.583
No.

1:03:33.833 --> 1:03:35.000
I didn't know it was your father,

1:03:36.416 --> 1:03:37.458
my condolences.

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.375
Corporal?

1:03:40.625 --> 1:03:42.208
This was very well done.

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:45.833
-I must get to Narvik.
-Yes.

1:03:45.916 --> 1:03:48.208
You'll be there soon fighting like that.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:51.000
How long?

1:03:51.708 --> 1:03:54.166
When we've emptied
the mountains of Germans.

1:03:54.250 --> 1:03:56.791
Might be fast now that we have
the French helping,

1:03:56.875 --> 1:03:58.583
and even the Poles from the south.

1:04:03.083 --> 1:04:04.250
I need to go home now.

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:06.000
Yes. Then we must fight.

1:04:07.833 --> 1:04:08.875
Corporal.

1:04:11.125 --> 1:04:12.625
Did you have a little kid as well?

1:04:16.875 --> 1:04:18.750
I don't know if he's alive.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.541
You need to believe.

1:04:24.083 --> 1:04:26.000
Believe that we'll soon
be standing in Narvik.

1:04:26.083 --> 1:04:27.916
Then you can look your kid in the eye

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.958
and know he'll be growing up
in a free fatherland.

1:04:32.125 --> 1:04:33.083
Come on.

1:04:33.833 --> 1:04:35.208
Here you go, up.

1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:38.625
This is what we're fighting for.

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:39.875
We're Norwegians,

1:04:40.625 --> 1:04:42.208
and we fight for each other.

1:04:43.041 --> 1:04:44.208
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:04:51.416 --> 1:04:56.041
NARVIK, 1 WEEK LATER

1:04:57.125 --> 1:05:03.958
CIVILIANS ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN THE GERMAN AND BRITISH SHIPS

1:05:17.791 --> 1:05:18.791
Does it hurt?

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:20.625
Yes.

1:05:28.458 --> 1:05:29.375
Hold it.

1:05:31.958 --> 1:05:33.833
Hey. We talked about this.

1:05:37.250 --> 1:05:38.625
There.

1:05:40.083 --> 1:05:42.041
Ingrid, I have to talk to you.

1:05:44.916 --> 1:05:46.875
-What is it?
-It's the Germans.

1:05:46.958 --> 1:05:48.291
They're going door to door,

1:05:48.375 --> 1:05:50.166
asking who's hiding the English.

1:05:50.958 --> 1:05:52.500
Have you told anyone?

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:53.791
No,

1:05:53.875 --> 1:05:55.125
but now they're asking for you.

1:05:55.875 --> 1:05:58.125
-As an interpreter.
-I don't know.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:05:59.750
You have to go.

1:06:01.166 --> 1:06:02.458
I'll watch Ole.

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:32.500
My superiors
want to ration the food further.

1:06:33.333 --> 1:06:34.666
They want to cut the rations.

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:36.333
No.

1:06:36.916 --> 1:06:38.875
People are starving. I can't do it.

1:06:38.958 --> 1:06:40.375
The people are starving.

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:42.125
-We need food.
-I know.

1:06:42.208 --> 1:06:44.750
It's only until
they find the British consul.

1:06:44.833 --> 1:06:46.916
Those who are helping the English now

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.250
are putting everyone else in danger.
Do you understand?

1:06:49.333 --> 1:06:52.041
They… He says it's only until
they find the consul and it's just…

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:53.625
I don't know where the consul is.

1:06:53.708 --> 1:06:55.583
Consul Wussow, I must ask you
to follow me to the basement.

1:06:55.666 --> 1:06:56.625
Yes.

1:06:57.333 --> 1:06:58.833
They say go to the basement.

1:06:58.916 --> 1:07:01.166
I don't want to go to the basement
with these Germans.

1:07:01.750 --> 1:07:04.333
They have lost their homes
and their families.

1:07:04.416 --> 1:07:07.666
Your people suffer the most
under the British air raids.

1:07:07.750 --> 1:07:08.958
He says it's us,

1:07:09.041 --> 1:07:11.750
the people of Narvik, who suffer
the most from the British shelling.

1:07:17.750 --> 1:07:20.041
-Where is Consul Ross?
-I don't know.

1:07:20.750 --> 1:07:22.875
If had I known,
I probably wouldn't have told them.

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:24.958
I can give you one more day,

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:28.250
then you must tell us who it is that's
providing the English with intelligence.

1:07:28.333 --> 1:07:30.041
Otherwise you will be charged
with high treason.

1:07:30.125 --> 1:07:32.875
They'll charge you with treason
if they don't show up tomorrow.

1:07:35.416 --> 1:07:37.708
It's dangerous outside.
You should stay the night here

1:07:37.791 --> 1:07:39.041
at the hotel.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:41.458
I have to go to my son.

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:44.791
For his sake,
you should think of your own safety.

1:07:44.875 --> 1:07:47.458
ROYAL HOTEL

1:07:47.541 --> 1:07:49.666
He has nightmares because of the bombs.

1:07:50.333 --> 1:07:51.833
I see.

1:07:51.916 --> 1:07:53.750
I only have nightmares during the day.

1:07:56.458 --> 1:07:58.666
And the days keep getting longer.

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:03.791
A few more weeks,
and there will be no more nights.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:24.208
How did it go?

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.083
Hi, honey.

1:08:28.625 --> 1:08:30.625
When did you last speak to the English?

1:08:31.333 --> 1:08:32.166
Yesterday.

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.958
Are they gonna obliterate the entire town
before they come ashore?

1:08:35.041 --> 1:08:36.250
They'll come soon.

1:08:39.083 --> 1:08:40.000
Soon?

1:08:40.583 --> 1:08:41.458
Yes.

1:08:41.541 --> 1:08:42.416
Mommy?

1:08:43.458 --> 1:08:44.916
I'm bleeding.

1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:46.541
I've looked. He's not bleeding.

1:08:46.625 --> 1:08:47.750
I know.

1:08:49.666 --> 1:08:51.333
It's his nightmares.

1:09:58.291 --> 1:09:59.416
Ole!

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:01.833
Ole!

1:10:01.916 --> 1:10:02.875
No!

1:10:02.958 --> 1:10:04.333
Ole!

1:10:05.750 --> 1:10:06.750
Ole!

1:10:39.125 --> 1:10:40.333
I'm sorry, Consul.

1:10:40.416 --> 1:10:42.208
She insisted.

1:10:43.166 --> 1:10:44.791
Get the doctor.

1:10:44.875 --> 1:10:46.000
Mrs. Tofte.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.083
-Right away, please.
-What happened?

1:10:49.166 --> 1:10:51.500
His wound is badly infected.

1:10:59.791 --> 1:11:03.375
We have countless
seriously injured soldiers.

1:11:04.458 --> 1:11:07.583
And the doctor is under orders
to take care of them first.

1:11:07.666 --> 1:11:09.041
I am sorry.

1:11:09.666 --> 1:11:11.250
But I work for you.

1:11:11.333 --> 1:11:12.583
I know.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.083
He is all I have. Please!

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:17.708
But you don't understand. I can't

1:11:17.791 --> 1:11:19.166
go over the heads of the commanders.

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:20.833
It is a military issue.

1:11:27.500 --> 1:11:28.958
I know where the consul is.

1:11:32.166 --> 1:11:33.333
Pardon?

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.291
I know where the Englishmen are.

1:12:11.125 --> 1:12:12.250
Ingrid?

1:12:19.208 --> 1:12:21.250
-Is Ingrid here?
-Please wait in the lobby.

1:12:21.333 --> 1:12:22.541
But it's really important.

1:12:22.625 --> 1:12:23.916
Ingrid?

1:12:24.958 --> 1:12:26.208
What's going on?

1:12:27.083 --> 1:12:28.166
Is he sick?

1:12:29.708 --> 1:12:31.083
He'll be okay.

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:34.041
Can I talk to you?

1:12:35.416 --> 1:12:37.125
-Not now.
-That's enough.

1:12:37.208 --> 1:12:38.708
I can't wait.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.208
They've been caught.

1:12:44.583 --> 1:12:45.750
How do you know?

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.291
There were German soldiers at the cabin.

1:12:47.375 --> 1:12:48.708
Did they see you?

1:12:49.625 --> 1:12:51.625
You have to do it carefully.

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:53.083
Make sure he's completely still.

1:13:00.958 --> 1:13:02.791
How were you able to get a doctor here?

1:13:04.875 --> 1:13:06.791
Bjorg, look at me.

1:13:10.291 --> 1:13:12.250
I didn't say you helped hide them.

1:13:21.958 --> 1:13:25.583
Look. Two millimeters to the right,
and it would have hit his lung.

1:13:25.666 --> 1:13:26.916
Small blessings.

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:46.250
ROMBAKEN FJORD, 2 WEEKS LATER

1:13:47.791 --> 1:13:54.250
NORWEGIAN AND FRENCH SOLDIERS HAVE WAITED
FOR THE GO-AHEAD FOR THE BATTLE OF NARVIK

1:14:12.791 --> 1:14:14.000
Grenade!

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:23.875
How are the blasting caps?

1:14:26.541 --> 1:14:28.000
They'll work, sir.

1:14:28.083 --> 1:14:29.041
Yes?

1:14:32.625 --> 1:14:33.541
Here.

1:14:33.625 --> 1:14:35.500
As soon as they've fired,

1:14:35.583 --> 1:14:38.750
they move the cannon back into
the tunnel so it's completely hidden.

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.041
Do you see the five machine gun positions?

1:14:56.833 --> 1:14:57.708
Yes.

1:14:58.291 --> 1:15:00.875
Once the French have taken it out,
you'll get a signal from there,

1:15:00.958 --> 1:15:04.791
then go full speed into the tunnel
and take out the cannons.

1:15:11.375 --> 1:15:13.833
This is the last hill before Narvik.

1:15:13.916 --> 1:15:15.041
Remember that!

1:15:46.958 --> 1:15:47.791
Come on!

1:16:10.750 --> 1:16:11.833
I don't see any signal.

1:16:13.041 --> 1:16:14.125
Keep going.

1:16:46.458 --> 1:16:48.041
Hansen!

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:06.541
Gunnar?

1:17:07.916 --> 1:17:08.958
Am I dying?

1:17:10.208 --> 1:17:11.375
It's not your blood.

1:17:14.250 --> 1:17:15.250
Run!

1:17:20.750 --> 1:17:22.166
Do you want to die?

1:17:40.666 --> 1:17:41.541
Halt!

1:17:43.291 --> 1:17:44.291
Halt!

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:52.791
Goddamn cowards!

1:17:55.541 --> 1:17:57.916
If anyone takes another step,

1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:58.833
I'll shoot them!

1:18:00.750 --> 1:18:01.625
Get back up!

1:18:03.583 --> 1:18:06.125
Major, MS Cairo has been hit.

1:18:06.708 --> 1:18:08.791
We have to take out that cannon!

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:12.250
Come on.

1:18:13.041 --> 1:18:14.333
Come on!

1:18:17.041 --> 1:18:18.750
Come on, guys! Let's follow him.

1:18:18.833 --> 1:18:19.791
Let's go, follow him!

1:18:19.875 --> 1:18:21.125
It's no use!

1:18:23.291 --> 1:18:24.875
We can't give up here, Gunnar.

1:18:25.958 --> 1:18:27.041
We have to get up.

1:18:29.875 --> 1:18:31.208
There's another way.

1:18:31.916 --> 1:18:33.083
Another way?

1:18:37.250 --> 1:18:38.458
We can't do it alone.

1:18:43.166 --> 1:18:44.125
French?

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:46.208
Come on, Praestnes!

1:18:47.166 --> 1:18:48.250
Yes.

1:19:59.416 --> 1:20:01.166
Everything alright?

1:20:01.250 --> 1:20:02.708
Everything under control?

1:20:04.458 --> 1:20:05.791
Say something!

1:20:24.666 --> 1:20:26.041
Shoot!

1:20:26.125 --> 1:20:27.125
Shoot them dead!

1:21:51.625 --> 1:21:52.583
Don't shoot!

1:21:54.250 --> 1:21:56.208
Hi. Don't shoot!

1:21:57.041 --> 1:21:58.166
Major!

1:21:58.916 --> 1:22:00.166
Major! The cannon has been taken out!

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:02.250
Roger.

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.291
Forward!

1:22:17.041 --> 1:22:18.416
Here, you got that?

1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:20.625
-What about this one?
-Burn it.

1:22:20.708 --> 1:22:21.958
Here's more.

1:22:22.041 --> 1:22:23.875
Go in and get the one from the stairs.

1:22:26.125 --> 1:22:27.958
-You asked for me?
-Yes.

1:22:28.041 --> 1:22:29.791
Wussow here

1:22:29.875 --> 1:22:31.958
insisted on talking with you
before he leaves.

1:22:34.333 --> 1:22:36.208
So you're doing better?

1:22:37.375 --> 1:22:38.875
That's nice to see.

1:22:40.333 --> 1:22:41.250
Thank you.

1:22:42.875 --> 1:22:44.333
I should thank you.

1:22:44.416 --> 1:22:46.625
You were a great help to me and

1:22:46.708 --> 1:22:47.666
to Narvik.

1:22:47.750 --> 1:22:50.000
ROYAL HOTEL

1:22:50.083 --> 1:22:51.458
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

1:22:51.958 --> 1:22:53.000
Sadly.

1:22:57.416 --> 1:23:00.791
Would you consider
accompanying me to Berlin?

1:23:08.291 --> 1:23:09.750
Ole, can you talk to Polly?

1:23:09.833 --> 1:23:11.208
I'll be there soon.

1:23:11.291 --> 1:23:12.791
Ole, come with me.

1:23:13.291 --> 1:23:14.875
There…

1:23:14.958 --> 1:23:15.916
Why?

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.333
Do you like chocolates?

1:23:19.916 --> 1:23:21.583
I am not one of you.

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:25.875
But you'll all soon be a part of us.

1:23:26.666 --> 1:23:28.375
The world is changing right now.

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:30.000
And very quickly.

1:23:30.083 --> 1:23:31.375
Hitler is victorious everywhere.

1:23:33.875 --> 1:23:35.041
But not here.

1:23:37.208 --> 1:23:40.583
There will be brutal
German air raids on Narvik.

1:23:41.250 --> 1:23:43.833
I don't want you to be here all alone
when this happens.

1:23:44.333 --> 1:23:45.583
Alone?

1:23:46.916 --> 1:23:48.958
I'm not alone.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:23:59.208
Mrs. Tofte.

1:24:01.208 --> 1:24:03.875
Your husband's name
is Gunnar Tofte, correct?

1:24:05.791 --> 1:24:06.875
Yes.

1:24:08.416 --> 1:24:11.166
His name has been removed from our lists.

1:24:12.750 --> 1:24:13.958
Removed?

1:24:15.583 --> 1:24:16.875
What does that mean?

1:24:17.666 --> 1:24:19.500
I'm afraid that's bad news.

1:24:20.791 --> 1:24:21.875
I am sorry.

1:24:26.375 --> 1:24:27.750
May I see the list?

1:24:38.916 --> 1:24:40.416
MOUNTAIN DIVISION, NORWEGIAN

1:24:41.458 --> 1:24:43.000
I just didn't know how to tell you.

1:24:44.500 --> 1:24:47.708
Your son was so ill at the time.

1:25:20.208 --> 1:25:22.125
-What are you doing?
-Folding.

1:25:23.791 --> 1:25:24.916
You're so good.

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.416
Did you know?

1:25:34.916 --> 1:25:35.916
What?

1:25:42.333 --> 1:25:43.291
About Gunnar?

1:25:46.416 --> 1:25:47.500
Did you know?

1:25:54.916 --> 1:25:56.000
I can't do this.

1:25:57.291 --> 1:25:58.833
Ingrid, you have to be strong.

1:26:00.875 --> 1:26:02.250
For Ole's sake.

1:26:02.833 --> 1:26:04.458
You have to get out of town.

1:26:06.291 --> 1:26:08.458
You can't stay here, people are talking.

1:26:08.541 --> 1:26:09.666
Who?

1:26:11.583 --> 1:26:13.333
You know how people are.

1:26:13.958 --> 1:26:15.875
They need someone to be angry at.

1:26:22.541 --> 1:26:24.208
Especially with the Germans leaving.

1:26:24.291 --> 1:26:25.875
Here's your pay, Ingrid.

1:26:26.583 --> 1:26:28.291
Don't you have family further north?

1:26:29.958 --> 1:26:32.666
You should go there, far away from Narvik.

1:26:33.166 --> 1:26:36.041
This is your money, take Ole and go.

1:26:38.708 --> 1:26:40.541
You can do it. You have Ole.

1:26:50.791 --> 1:26:52.625
Ole, come.

1:26:59.916 --> 1:27:01.083
What about you?

1:27:02.333 --> 1:27:04.291
How will people look at you?

1:27:04.375 --> 1:27:06.500
I only have myself to worry about.

1:27:07.750 --> 1:27:09.708
I don't have a little…

1:27:09.791 --> 1:27:11.333
prince like you do.

1:27:12.083 --> 1:27:13.208
I'll be fine.

1:27:25.458 --> 1:27:28.083
Hip hip!

1:27:39.083 --> 1:27:43.416
<i>It's a long way to southern Norway</i>

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:45.416
<i>It's a long way</i>

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:47.291
<i>-To go</i>
<i>-To go</i>

1:27:47.375 --> 1:27:50.791
<i>We shall win, we shall prevail</i>

1:27:50.875 --> 1:27:54.541
<i>When we all together go</i>

1:27:54.625 --> 1:27:58.166
<i>The weapons, hear them calling</i>

1:27:58.250 --> 1:28:01.833
<i>We will chase the Germans home</i>

1:28:01.916 --> 1:28:05.666
<i>It's a far, far way to southern Norway</i>

1:28:05.750 --> 1:28:08.541
<i>But we'll leave right away</i>

1:28:08.625 --> 1:28:09.708
And the French!

1:28:09.791 --> 1:28:13.083
<i>It's a long way to southern Norway</i>

1:28:13.166 --> 1:28:16.125
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

1:28:17.208 --> 1:28:18.750
The town is yours now.

1:28:20.125 --> 1:28:21.416
Cheers!

1:28:40.416 --> 1:28:42.000
Is that his wife?

1:28:42.083 --> 1:28:43.375
She's beautiful.

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:48.666
Congratulations!

1:28:51.041 --> 1:28:52.208
Go back home.

1:28:55.750 --> 1:28:57.166
Your city is yours now.

1:29:04.416 --> 1:29:05.958
Here they come!

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.833
Here they come!

1:29:09.916 --> 1:29:11.583
Our boys are coming!

1:29:15.500 --> 1:29:19.333
NARVIK, 28 MAY 1940

1:29:20.541 --> 1:29:22.958
Hooray!

1:29:23.041 --> 1:29:24.500
Hooray!

1:29:44.375 --> 1:29:47.000
Hooray!

1:29:53.250 --> 1:29:54.625
Welcome home!

1:29:59.041 --> 1:30:00.375
Isn't Ingrid here?

1:30:00.458 --> 1:30:01.625
I don't know.

1:30:03.541 --> 1:30:06.875
It's probably not easy for her,
as much as she's dealt with the Germans.

1:30:09.208 --> 1:30:10.250
What do you mean?

1:31:26.208 --> 1:31:27.125
Ole?

1:31:29.791 --> 1:31:30.833
Look what I found.

1:31:52.166 --> 1:31:53.875
They said you were dead.

1:31:53.958 --> 1:31:54.916
Who did?

1:32:14.791 --> 1:32:15.833
Hi, Ole.

1:32:17.333 --> 1:32:19.000
Aren't you going to say, "Hi" to daddy?

1:32:22.708 --> 1:32:24.500
Hi. Hi, you.

1:32:24.583 --> 1:32:25.875
Hi.

1:32:25.958 --> 1:32:27.458
Nice flag.

1:32:27.541 --> 1:32:28.583
Thank you.

1:32:28.666 --> 1:32:30.166
Should we celebrate outside?

1:32:31.416 --> 1:32:32.833
I'm not allowed.

1:32:33.708 --> 1:32:35.250
Of course you are!

1:32:37.458 --> 1:32:38.708
Why not?

1:32:38.791 --> 1:32:41.416
Polly said we have to leave town.

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.333
Yeah, we have to leave.

1:32:49.708 --> 1:32:51.291
I ran into Bjorg.

1:32:53.750 --> 1:32:55.291
Do you know what she's talking about?

1:32:57.625 --> 1:33:00.166
I can… I can explain, but not now.

1:33:01.208 --> 1:33:03.666
-Why not?
-Please, Gunnar.

1:33:04.250 --> 1:33:05.916
Should we bring the train?

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:07.250
What did you do with the Germans?

1:33:08.958 --> 1:33:10.750
I did what I had to.

1:33:13.041 --> 1:33:14.000
What?

1:33:16.958 --> 1:33:18.333
He was dying.

1:33:19.833 --> 1:33:21.125
Can you show daddy your scar?

1:33:23.458 --> 1:33:26.291
-No. Ole, you don't have to show anything.
-See.

1:33:26.875 --> 1:33:28.125
Have you been with a German?

1:33:32.625 --> 1:33:33.541
No.

1:33:36.208 --> 1:33:38.291
Then why are you running away? Answer!

1:33:39.166 --> 1:33:40.916
Because I informed on some Englishmen.

1:33:44.666 --> 1:33:45.708
That's not true.

1:33:47.250 --> 1:33:48.208
It is.

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.166
They're on our side.

1:33:53.208 --> 1:33:54.875
They weren't on my side.

1:33:56.958 --> 1:33:59.541
I wouldn't be standing here
if it were not for them.

1:33:59.625 --> 1:34:01.958
Then look where you are standing!

1:34:03.125 --> 1:34:05.708
Ole almost died from an English shell,

1:34:06.666 --> 1:34:08.958
and that same goddamn shell
killed your dad…

1:34:09.041 --> 1:34:10.833
That must have been an accident.

1:34:11.750 --> 1:34:13.375
That's not a reason to switch sides.

1:34:14.166 --> 1:34:15.333
You don't understand.

1:34:15.416 --> 1:34:16.875
What, Ingrid? That you're a traitor!?

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:19.208
Who have I betrayed?

1:34:19.291 --> 1:34:20.291
Us!

1:34:20.375 --> 1:34:21.916
Us who defended you.

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.916
Who was defending Ole?

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.958
While you were out waging war?

1:34:28.208 --> 1:34:29.458
Should I have let him die?

1:34:31.625 --> 1:34:33.125
Ingrid, this is war.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:35.875
People die!

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:41.625
It would have been better

1:34:42.666 --> 1:34:44.958
if you never came back!

1:34:47.541 --> 1:34:49.000
Ole, are you ready?

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:50.791
Come.

1:35:23.791 --> 1:35:25.500
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding!

1:35:25.583 --> 1:35:27.458
No, you're not bleeding.

1:35:28.041 --> 1:35:29.416
Hey.

1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:30.916
Hey.

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:32.250
You have to listen.

1:35:45.666 --> 1:35:48.041
Now you see how the Germans
thank you for helping.

1:36:02.125 --> 1:36:04.666
Praestnes, get down!

1:36:12.750 --> 1:36:13.750
Gunnar?

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:26.625
Listen.

1:36:27.541 --> 1:36:28.583
It's too late.

1:36:29.708 --> 1:36:30.916
He's dead.

1:36:33.250 --> 1:36:34.125
Gone.

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.333
Why didn't we return fire?

1:36:48.416 --> 1:36:50.750
The English are defending the airspace.

1:36:50.833 --> 1:36:52.416
There are no English ships in the fjord.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:56.625
If the English have left,
it's to defend their homeland.

1:37:03.625 --> 1:37:06.041
Is it true that Hitler has taken France?

1:37:09.416 --> 1:37:11.333
Fight for everything you hold dear,

1:37:13.041 --> 1:37:14.625
and die if you must.

1:37:21.291 --> 1:37:24.666
Private Praestnes did just that.
He died for everything he held dear,

1:37:24.750 --> 1:37:27.166
and that's a sacrifice he made
for all of us standing here.

1:37:27.250 --> 1:37:30.208
Because we are Norwegians,
and we fight for each other.

1:37:31.125 --> 1:37:32.541
And now more than ever,

1:37:32.625 --> 1:37:35.208
we need those of you who are willing

1:37:35.291 --> 1:37:36.625
to sacrifice themselves.

1:37:36.708 --> 1:37:38.583
Who are willing to sacrifice everything

1:37:38.666 --> 1:37:39.916
for what they hold dear.

1:38:08.375 --> 1:38:09.750
Yes.

1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:14.708
Where is the camp?

1:38:14.791 --> 1:38:16.666
Up the road to the right.

1:38:16.750 --> 1:38:18.125
Where can I find a weapon?

1:38:18.208 --> 1:38:19.583
The camp's in the woods.

1:38:20.750 --> 1:38:22.833
German planes!

1:38:22.916 --> 1:38:24.250
Planes!

1:38:27.083 --> 1:38:28.500
Come onboard!

1:38:28.583 --> 1:38:30.666
Don't stand there and drink!

1:38:30.750 --> 1:38:31.583
Come on.

1:38:31.666 --> 1:38:32.625
Move away.

1:38:33.916 --> 1:38:35.791
Should throw her into the sea.

1:38:35.875 --> 1:38:37.333
Come on. Hurry.

1:38:39.458 --> 1:38:41.041
Where can I get weapons?

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:43.291
You must help her.

1:38:43.375 --> 1:38:45.625
Get some Germans to help you.

1:41:07.708 --> 1:41:12.208
LOCAL FISHING BOATS SUCCEEDED
IN EVACUATING THE REMAINING CIVILIANS

1:41:12.291 --> 1:41:16.958
BEFORE GERMAN BOMBERS
LEFT THE CITY IN RUINS

1:41:30.041 --> 1:41:35.916
THE RECAPTURE OF NARVIK IS CONSIDERED
HITLER'S FIRST DEFEAT IN WORLD WAR II

1:41:37.583 --> 1:41:42.541
BUT THE VICTORY WAS BRIEF

1:41:55.750 --> 1:42:01.541
WITHOUT INFORMING NORWAY, GREAT BRITAIN
AND FRANCE ORDERED A FULL WITHDRAWAL

1:42:12.166 --> 1:42:19.000
NORWEGIAN FORCES WERE ALONE AND HAD TO
LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS ON JUNE 8TH 1940

1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:39.958
THE BATTLE OF NARVIK
IS THE LARGEST BATTLE ON NORWEGIAN SOIL

1:47:33.125 --> 1:47:35.875
