00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.020
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.611
Dear Nephew Gobo,
I am thriving in Outer Space.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.489
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.241
And in the Fraggle tradition,

01:14.324 --> 01:16.869
I recently decided
to celebrate my birthday.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.123
You see, ma'am, Fraggles get to choose
when we celebrate our birthdays,

01:21.206 --> 01:22.416
and I choose today.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.835
Yes, I'm excited too.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.882
The smell of good food
and the sound of good music.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.218
And the Silly Creatures acted quickly
to celebrate my birthday.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.930
For me? Oh, you shouldn't have.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.934
They even had a party hat for me.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.979
Hey! That's my tortilla!

01:44.062 --> 01:45.898
And festive hors d'oeuvres.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.982
Oh, boy.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.281
H-Hot. Hot! Hot, hot, hot. Hot. Hot.

01:54.364 --> 01:58.285
I never felt so alive,
and the music soothed my soul.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.082
Everywhere I looked, there were treasures.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.711
But I kept my signature cool.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.255
Cake!

02:13.258 --> 02:16.678
The cake was delicious,
but I decided to leave early.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.349
No. Hey, wait. It's my birthday party!

02:21.016 --> 02:24.019
All in all, it was a wonderful birthday.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.231
Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.152
"PS I've sent back
my favorite party favor."

02:33.987 --> 02:35.989
Looks like some kind of confetti.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.287
Maybe I'll have
my next birthday party in Outer Space.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.998
A little thing about me?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.960
I love birthday parties!

02:49.628 --> 02:51.839
I think I'll have mine today.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.512
Red, I swear this is not
an aggressive question,

02:58.595 --> 03:00.764
but didn't we just celebrate
your birthday?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.349
-Did we?
-Yeah.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.435
Yeah!
There's still zazzle-berry cake left over!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.229
I had five slices!

03:07.813 --> 03:10.524
-Thanks, Pogey.
-Okay, that's fair.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.150
-Yeah.
-I can wait.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.363
How about now?

03:18.365 --> 03:20.492
I remember my last birthday.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.745
I had a blast.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.001
I'm having a blast.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.753
Yeah. Us too.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.923
Yeah.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.302
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.930
Well, let's search our noodles.
Who hasn't had a birthday in a while?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.183
-Well.
-Let's see.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.269
Fragga-kazam! The Great Wembleton!

03:50.272 --> 03:51.523
-Hi, Wembley.
-Hey, Wembley.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.943
I've been working on
my foggy-fruit appearing act.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.279
Still having trouble with
the disappearing though.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.574
Wembley,
we were just talking about birthdays.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.825
Yeah.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.578
Why, I can't remember
the last time I had my birthday.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.498
Yes! Wembley, look inside yourself.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.125
Don't you feel older?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.295
Well, I think I feel…

04:13.378 --> 04:14.463
kinda…

04:14.546 --> 04:15.923
hungry?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.509
Maybe I'll get some zazzle-berry cake.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.720
-Yeah.
-No, sorry. I ated it all.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.222
Pogey.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.265
Wembley, you have to let us celebrate you.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.559
-You're a great Fraggle.
-Yeah.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.269
Well, okay.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.605
I guess it's my birthday.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.273
Hooray.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.609
All right. So, what do you wanna do?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.737
What-- What do I wanna do?

04:39.488 --> 04:40.405
Yeah.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.075
-I have to choose the activity we do?
-Well, yeah.

04:43.158 --> 04:47.955
So, if it's a fun day or not a fun day,
i-it's all on my shoulders?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.331
Yeah.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.043
I…

04:54.461 --> 04:56.505
Come on, come on, come on.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.601
I see what he means
about the disappearing part.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.728
-Yeah. He's gotta work on that.
-Yeah.

05:14.648 --> 05:19.027
Every day, eight million pieces of plastic
make their way into the ocean.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.738
If those pieces looked
anything like this bottle,

05:21.822 --> 05:25.784
then removing them would be
as easy as… scoop.

05:25.868 --> 05:30.205
But in the real world, plastic breaks down
into tiny little pieces of plastic.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.213
We don't want this in our water!

05:38.297 --> 05:41.842
Our oceans are in trouble
if we can't find a way to get it out!

05:41.925 --> 05:43.635
Because this…

05:48.724 --> 05:50.142
is unscoopable.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.730
We need to find a bacteria
that can consume microplastics.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.233
I posted that video a week ago,
and still not a single view.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.860
You think the view counter is broken?

06:01.069 --> 06:03.363
What am I doing wrong? This is important.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.448
Am I not interesting enough?

06:06.116 --> 06:08.285
Well, let's see what's popular.
What's trending.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.871
-…smash that like button.
-Okay.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.873
-Like and subscribe.
-A lot of noise.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.958
A lot of effects.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.126
A lot of…

06:17.169 --> 06:18.378
-Whatever that is.
-Like and subscribe.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.465
I guess I gotta up my game.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.468
Don't forget. Like and subscribe.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.678
The Internet is not going to know
what hit it!

06:36.730 --> 06:40.442
Sorry, folks, we've got
some kind of vine blocking the track.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.945
We're gonna have to stay here
until it's cleared.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.114
Man. I better tell my boss
I'm gonna be late for work.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.700
Hey, boss? I'm gonna be late for work.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.037
Unacceptable!

06:52.120 --> 06:55.249
Not to worry, folks.
We've got our best Doozers on the job.

06:55.332 --> 06:58.377
All Doozers reporting for duty!

06:58.877 --> 07:00.671
We've got a track to fix.

07:02.714 --> 07:06.844
Dream a dream and make it true
That's what Doozers like to do

07:06.927 --> 07:09.763
And building is the Doozer way to go

07:09.847 --> 07:11.139
Two, three, four!

07:11.223 --> 07:13.308
'Cause every day
The world is new

07:13.392 --> 07:15.394
There's dreams to pay attention to

07:15.477 --> 07:19.481
And building is the surest way we know
Two, three, four!

07:19.565 --> 07:23.861
Set your shoulder
Move that boulder

07:23.944 --> 07:28.031
Up, two, three, four
Up, two, three, four

07:28.115 --> 07:32.077
Make our dreams work
Through our teamwork

07:32.160 --> 07:34.830
Up, two, three, four
Up!

07:34.913 --> 07:36.206
There's mamma.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.333
And when the Doozer day is done

07:38.417 --> 07:40.377
There's still some time for Doozer fun

07:40.460 --> 07:43.213
So take your helmets off
And set them down

07:43.297 --> 07:44.339
Two, three, four!

07:44.423 --> 07:46.633
There's dreams to dream
There's work to do

07:46.717 --> 07:48.635
But after all the work is through

07:48.719 --> 07:51.263
There's still some Doozer dreams
To go around

07:51.346 --> 07:52.931
Two, three, four!

07:53.015 --> 07:57.102
Set your shoulders
Move that boulder

07:57.186 --> 08:01.481
Up, two, three, four
Up, two, three, four

08:01.565 --> 08:05.569
Make our dreams work
Through our teamwork

08:05.652 --> 08:08.113
Up, two, three, four
Up!

08:13.368 --> 08:15.370
Now, let's go clear that track.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.206
Turbo, brief me.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.540
Well, Cotterpin, you see,

08:18.624 --> 08:21.168
these strange vines have been
popping up everywhere

08:21.251 --> 08:22.836
since all the new water arrived.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.381
Clear it from the track. Big job!
Think we're up for it, Wrench?

08:26.465 --> 08:28.842
What, do you think
we're a bunch of Fraggles?

08:28.926 --> 08:31.428
Chomp, chomp, chomp. Play, play, play.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.804
"I'm a Fraggle."

08:34.139 --> 08:36.475
-Good one! Good one.
-Hilarious.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.313
I don't wanna decide
what to do for my birthday.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.900
Maybe they all forgot about it.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.236
Hey, birthday Fraggle.
What do you wanna do today?

08:47.986 --> 08:51.198
-I-- Well, I--
-Well, no need to wemble.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.867
How about I sing you
the birthday song I wrote for ya?

08:53.951 --> 08:56.453
-Well, I guess--
-You're gonna love it! Just gotta warm up.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.332
Hey, Wembley!

09:00.415 --> 09:05.170
How about we do a guided meditation
for your birthday?

09:05.254 --> 09:07.965
I-- Well, I-- I guess it could be fun.

09:08.048 --> 09:12.594
Great! Let me just summon
my inner merriment-making muse.

09:12.678 --> 09:17.474
Hey, Wemble-butt, how do you feel about
a birthday spinning contest?

09:18.517 --> 09:20.018
Probably a little nauseous.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.272
Great!
Last one to the pond is a rotten radish.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.401
Wembley. Wembley!

09:29.236 --> 09:32.030
-I have such a fun birthday idea.
-Yeah?

09:32.114 --> 09:35.659
We monitor this slippery moss patch
and make sure nobody falls.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.120
I don't r--

09:38.787 --> 09:39.663
I know.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.291
No words for how awesome it is.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.919
-I'm gonna go get my cones.
-Wait, but-- but I--

09:48.964 --> 09:51.508
I don't think I wanna do
any of those things.

09:53.886 --> 09:57.639
But… as long as my friends are happy,

09:57.723 --> 09:59.766
well, maybe that's enough.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.852
Are you talking to me?

10:01.935 --> 10:05.105
No, Mr. Grizzard.
I was just talking to myself.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.525
-Okay. Well, happy birthday, I guess.
-Yeah.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.694
-Time to get your spin on, Wembley!
-Okay.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.113
Coming!

10:14.948 --> 10:17.117
Isn't this so much fun?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.244
Yeah!

10:21.038 --> 10:22.039
Be right back!

10:23.373 --> 10:27.377
it's your birthday song
If you know the words then sing along

10:28.003 --> 10:29.630
Such a well-thought-out song, Gobo.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.131
-Thanks.
-Hey, Wembley!

10:31.215 --> 10:33.884
Anyway, I'll just be right back.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.179
Slow down. Cave hazard.
Caution. Cave hazard.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.389
-Yeah, watch out!
-Yeah. Thanks.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.143
-Slow down. Cave hazard.
-Wembley!

10:43.227 --> 10:44.478
Boober, I'll be right back.

10:46.063 --> 10:50.609
Now, think of the most relaxing sound
you can imagine.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.781
I'll be right back!

10:55.864 --> 10:57.366
-Danger.
-Right. Where were we?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.868
-Wembley, over here!
-I'll be back.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.793
-Hey, Wembley!
-Wembley!

11:07.876 --> 11:09.169
-Wembley!
-On my way!

11:09.253 --> 11:10.337
-Wembley!
-Wembley.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.672
-Wembley!
-Coming.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.006
-Wembley!
-Coming! Coming!

11:13.090 --> 11:15.551
-Wembley, where are you?
-Wembley.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.344
Wembley! Wembley!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.728
Thanks for the song, Gobo.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.731
Thanks for the song, Gobo!

11:32.442 --> 11:33.777
Enjoying my birthday, Red?

11:35.404 --> 11:36.405
Red?

11:39.324 --> 11:40.325
Where's Wembley?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.411
I-I'm right here, Boober.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.914
Mokey? Mokey?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.425
You! You're me.

11:56.508 --> 11:57.634
But you're me.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.428
We're all me!

11:59.511 --> 12:02.306
We got split into four,
and now no one can hear or see us.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.768
I don't have anything to add,
but I'm also very concerned!

12:11.565 --> 12:17.613
Microplastic waterfall!

12:20.532 --> 12:21.575
Dance break!

12:25.537 --> 12:29.583
Science. Science. Science!
Like and subscribe.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.086
Subscribe for more videos.
They're w-w-w-wacky!

12:36.089 --> 12:37.591
What do you think, Sprockie?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.595
Well, yeah,
the science is overshadowed a little,

12:41.678 --> 12:43.889
but it's worth it if it gets views, right?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.850
Well, what do you know about videos?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.811
I saw you watching a steam train
for two hours yesterday.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.189
I'm uploading it.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.406
The vine is still in the way,
but they're working on it.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.952
So just pull the vine down,
but don't tug too hard, okay?

13:05.035 --> 13:08.247
Wha-- Okay, tug hard?
Yeah, no problem, Cotterpin.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.082
No, I said don't tug it--

13:13.460 --> 13:17.256
Great Doozer on a Snoozer!
Look at all this goo!

13:17.339 --> 13:19.883
What a mess, Cotterpin.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.969
It's not that bad.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.307
Okay. It is bad.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.898
No Internet? No!

13:35.816 --> 13:39.653
Well, Sprocket, I guess I'm not getting
any views on anything now.

13:42.573 --> 13:45.075
Daddy, can I try on your armor?

13:46.034 --> 13:48.412
That's the royal armor, son.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.582
You can wear it when radishes fly!

13:52.249 --> 13:53.542
It's a good idea, right?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.128
-The Trash Heap will know what to do.
-Definitely!

13:56.211 --> 13:59.006
And I'm so glad we grabbed
these radishes along the way.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.508
I was starving!

14:02.426 --> 14:04.970
Yeah.
And Pogey ate all the zazzle-berry cake.

14:09.516 --> 14:14.104
Pa! The-- The-- The radishes are flying!

14:14.771 --> 14:17.399
I get to wear your armor like you said!

14:18.150 --> 14:22.029
Marjory, you really know
how to work that spaghetti.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.199
I'm gonna look so good in that sweater.

14:25.282 --> 14:29.203
Yeah. You should start
a whole food clothing line.

14:29.286 --> 14:33.916
Like, yeah, pizza shorts,
rigatoni hats. Yeah.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.920
How is Marjory supposed
to help us if she can't even see us?

14:38.003 --> 14:40.923
Oh, I can see everything, little Fraggle.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.925
I'm the Trash Heap.

14:44.051 --> 14:48.180
Marjory, a-are you talking to
those floating, half-eaten radishes?

14:48.764 --> 14:51.308
Quiet, boys. I've got work to do.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.520
So, what is this?
What am I seeing here?

14:55.229 --> 14:56.230
Well, you see--

14:56.313 --> 14:58.273
-What he means is--
--What happened was--

14:58.357 --> 15:00.859
-No, sorry, go ahead.
-Like he was saying…

15:02.027 --> 15:05.739
All right, all right. That's enough
of this particular shenanigan.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.658
Now, one of you go.

15:07.741 --> 15:11.286
Well, okay. My friends all picked
activities for my birthday,

15:11.370 --> 15:14.164
and, well, I-I-I wanted them to be happy,

15:14.248 --> 15:17.167
so I-I didn't say anything
and tried to do them all at once

15:17.251 --> 15:18.669
and, well, poof!

15:20.671 --> 15:24.675
It sounds like instead of speaking up,
you quieted down.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.136
And now you're all discombobulated.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.848
But I like making my pals happy.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.392
And that makes you a great friend.

15:33.475 --> 15:38.856
But my little Fraggle, you have to look
inside and figure out what you want.

15:39.815 --> 15:44.278
You must go
to the Cave of Recombobulation.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.613
The Cave of Recombobulation?

15:48.365 --> 15:52.786
I like it when you speak in unison.
Kinda like a little barbershop quartet.

15:52.870 --> 15:56.164
Now, the cave's entrance is behind me.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.166
You go inside and say…

15:59.376 --> 16:04.089
"Sploopy blate, this cave is great.
Let us recombobulate."

16:04.173 --> 16:06.842
And then you run and crash back together.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.178
-Well, we can say words.
-And crash into stuff.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.762
Thanks, Marjory.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.098
I've got a lot of questions, Marjory,

16:13.182 --> 16:17.811
but I guess mostly is
who in the world are you talking to?

16:17.895 --> 16:21.899
Patience, patience.
All will be revealed.

16:21.982 --> 16:26.695
Now,
what do we think about meatball buttons?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.864
-Yeah.
-A little extra sauce for me, please.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.909
-What do they call it? High food couture.
-Yeah.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.746
Are we sure we're in the right cave?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.581
-Maybe there's another one.
-Yeah.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.752
Oh, no.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.670
There's even more of us now!

16:45.005 --> 16:46.590
Wait.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.428
It's just a reflection.

16:57.935 --> 16:58.936
Beautiful.

17:01.271 --> 17:05.150
Okay, well,
I-I'm gonna miss all of you.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.362
-All of me?
-All of us?

17:09.445 --> 17:10.948
I think it's all of I.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.407
Okay, let's do this.

17:14.576 --> 17:18.955
Sploopy blate, this cave is great.
Let us recombobulate.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.257
It's happening! It's happening!

17:30.634 --> 17:31.885
Well, that didn't work.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.221
We just swooshed through each other.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.769
How did we get back to the Great Hall?

17:40.853 --> 17:42.521
What are we doing over here?

17:43.272 --> 17:47.234
I know what Wembley wants
He would love to sing a song

17:47.317 --> 17:51.321
Gosh, that's not really what I want
I don't know what I want

17:51.405 --> 17:55.325
He wants to meditate
Take a breath, say Namaste

17:55.409 --> 17:58.620
That doesn't seem like
What I want at all

17:59.413 --> 18:02.708
I'm sure I know him best
He just wants to spin and spin

18:02.791 --> 18:05.878
-And spin and spin and spin and spin
-That doesn't seem like what I want

18:05.961 --> 18:07.462
It's like no one can hear me.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.966
Or make a siren sound
He could make it long and loud!

18:11.049 --> 18:12.676
Stop!

18:12.759 --> 18:15.262
That's not what I want

18:15.345 --> 18:21.351
That's not what I want to do
No, that's not what I want

18:21.435 --> 18:23.061
No, no, no, no

18:23.145 --> 18:26.481
It's not up to you to choose

18:26.565 --> 18:27.941
So, stop!

18:28.525 --> 18:30.694
That's not what I want

18:30.777 --> 18:32.529
-Don't wanna sing
-No

18:32.613 --> 18:34.531
-Don't wanna spin
-No spin

18:34.615 --> 18:36.366
-Don't wanna meditate
-No meditate

18:36.450 --> 18:39.036
-Are you listening?
-No, no, no, no

18:39.119 --> 18:42.539
'Cause that's not what I want to do

18:42.623 --> 18:44.291
-No, no
-No, stop!

18:45.042 --> 18:46.877
That's not what I want

18:46.960 --> 18:49.213
That's not what I want!

18:49.296 --> 18:51.215
That's not what I want

18:51.298 --> 18:52.299
No!

18:58.096 --> 18:59.389
Guys? What's going on?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.976
W-We're back
in the Cave of Recombob-- Guys?

19:05.229 --> 19:06.438
Oh, my Wembley.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.982
It's just me.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.612
Everything that just happened was
a vision.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.324
The cave worked!

19:24.248 --> 19:25.374
Another me!

19:27.876 --> 19:29.294
It's just a reflection.

19:29.378 --> 19:30.379
All good.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.384
I did it, Madam Heap! I'm me again.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.471
I'm gonna go tell my friends
what I wanna do for my birthday.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.599
-That's great, little Fraggle.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.185
Hey, where did he come from?

19:45.269 --> 19:46.436
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.480
Don't worry about it, boys.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.650
Now, how are your matching
spaghetti sweaters fitting, huh?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.735
Stylish and delicious.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.697
-You really outdone yourself, Marjory.
-Yeah.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.661
Junior Gorg, protector of the Gorg castle.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.250
A Fraggle enemy.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.921
Come back. Come back.

20:13.005 --> 20:15.924
I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.888
I didn't get him.

20:25.809 --> 20:30.606
All right. I've reset this thing,
shook it, yelled at it. Nothing.

20:31.190 --> 20:34.610
With no Internet,
I'm not uploading any of my experiments.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.945
It's so frustrating!

20:38.906 --> 20:41.867
I just wanna save the oceans!

20:43.035 --> 20:44.453
Me too!

20:46.038 --> 20:48.874
Wait, really? Well, I-I'm getting my PhD,

20:48.957 --> 20:51.460
and I made a couple of videos
if you wanna follow me.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.295
Cool. I'll check them out.

20:57.007 --> 21:02.846
-Hello, I need to get to work.
-Excuse me, is this gonna get going soon?

21:03.889 --> 21:07.226
We've gotta get this goo cleaned up
and fix the track.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.477
Any ideas?

21:09.311 --> 21:12.898
Let's see.
Well, this stuff is super sticky.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.776
Yeah. I-I got an idea.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.152
Let's hear it.

21:17.236 --> 21:18.695
Moss beards!

21:20.322 --> 21:22.032
Cool, right?

21:22.115 --> 21:25.619
Okay, that is an idea, not a helpful one.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.539
But the goo is sticky.

21:28.622 --> 21:31.291
So it makes me wonder…

21:33.043 --> 21:35.963
Track's fixed,
and we even fixed that cable.

21:36.046 --> 21:40.175
Just as I suspected.
That sticky goo is actually pretty useful.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.387
Hey, all right!

21:45.013 --> 21:47.724
I think the three of us
all did equally well today.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.060
Oh, boy.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.645
We're stuck!

21:51.728 --> 21:53.105
Oh, boy.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.609
-Let's get unstuck. You go left.
-And I'll go left.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.446
The Internet's back.

22:01.530 --> 22:04.533
Okay, quick. I've gotta upload
my fun video before my neighbor--

22:04.616 --> 22:07.035
Hey, I'm watching your video now!

22:07.119 --> 22:10.330
No, no. Not that one!
I have a fun one coming!

22:10.414 --> 22:13.917
Wow. I had no idea
microplastics were such a problem.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.836
Thank you!

22:15.919 --> 22:17.963
Well, hey, how about that?

22:18.046 --> 22:20.966
I guess the Internet was sending
a sign that there's only one me.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.802
I've gotta stay true to myself.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.055
Thanks, neighbor!

22:27.139 --> 22:29.266
I'm gonna send this to my mom.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.809
Hey, Ma!

22:32.936 --> 22:36.023
It's not like Wembley to just ditch us.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.275
Maybe he didn't like my spinning party.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.152
Spinning party?

22:40.235 --> 22:42.279
I was doing a guided meditation party.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.615
I was doing a safety watch party.

22:45.449 --> 22:47.117
And it was pretty wild.

22:47.743 --> 22:49.328
And I was singing for him.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.496
We were all doing different things.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.957
That must have been really hard
on a wembler like Wembley.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.876
-Yeah.
-It was.

22:56.627 --> 22:59.338
Wow, Wembley,
is that one of your magic tricks?

22:59.421 --> 23:01.673
No. I'm just a very quiet sitter.

23:03.509 --> 23:04.968
So, where were you?

23:05.052 --> 23:08.055
Well, I split into four Wembleys…

23:08.138 --> 23:10.432
and we were invisible,
and you couldn't hear us,

23:10.516 --> 23:13.352
and we were all the same, but different.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.146
Okay, sure.

23:16.230 --> 23:20.734
Let's just say I had to go
to the Cave of Recombobulation.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.111
Of course. Yeah.

23:23.195 --> 23:26.156
-I get it.
-Yeah, the Cave of Re… combob--

23:26.240 --> 23:28.116
-I don't get it. No.
-Me neither.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.368
-I don't know.
-No. No.

23:29.451 --> 23:33.497
Never mind. Because now I know
what I wanna do for my birthday.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.960
I-- I wanna just be here with you,
my friends.

23:38.043 --> 23:41.964
And, well, I'm sorry
if that's boring or disappointing,

23:42.047 --> 23:44.049
but, well, i-it's what I wanna do.

23:45.676 --> 23:47.427
Hooray!

23:48.011 --> 23:50.180
Wembley,
that's a perfect way to spend a birthday.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.473
And a safe one.

23:51.557 --> 23:54.935
I'm so happy you finally spoke up
for yourself, Wembley.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.019
Yeah.

23:56.103 --> 24:00.065
We can have a spinning celebration
when I have my next birthday,

24:00.148 --> 24:02.025
later today.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.236
Just joking!

24:05.988 --> 24:08.490
-Happy birthday, Wembley!
-Happy birthday, Wembley.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.534
-Yeah, happy birthday, buddy.
-Happy birthday.
