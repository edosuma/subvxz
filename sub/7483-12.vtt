¶ ¶

00:09.677 --> 00:11.744
(staple gun firing)

00:14.181 --> 00:16.248
(drill whirs)

00:21.489 --> 00:24.123
Deadline was 24 hours ago.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.492
Why am I still picking
Ethernet cables out of my ass?

00:26.494 --> 00:29.194
We're working fast as we can
on a Saturday, Mr. Blanchard.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.063
But we gotta work safe, too.
It's...

00:31.065 --> 00:33.065
Making money
has never been safe.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.134
Remember that,
and someday

00:35.136 --> 00:37.069
you'll be the one
giving orders to peons.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.771
CALLEN:
Right behind you, sir.

00:38.773 --> 00:41.306
Ahead of schedule today, Jimmy.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.308
Well, you said you like your
mail early, Mr. Blanchard,

00:43.310 --> 00:44.610
so I figured
I'd start my...

00:44.612 --> 00:46.178
my route on this floor
every day.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.313
You ever get sick
of slinging letters,

00:48.315 --> 00:49.748
you let me know.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.583
Guys, move it up on
this side. Come on.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.085
WORKER:
On this side?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.219
BLANCHARD:
Yeah. It's not
even, guys.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.320
Is this the color
we talked about?

00:55.322 --> 00:56.755
WORKER:
No, you know what?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.257
It's the one we were given.
I can't do anything...

00:58.259 --> 00:59.258
BLANCHARD:
Guys, it's not even straight.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.526
Up on the left.
Yeah, up on the...

01:00.528 --> 01:02.661
(faint voices over earwig)

01:04.265 --> 01:06.265
Dude's a regular Dale Carnegie.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.600
Did Carnegie win friends
and influence people

01:08.602 --> 01:10.769
by selling weapons
to the Molina Cartel?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.072
Blanchard's ready to promote you
from the mailroom

01:13.074 --> 01:14.673
after two weeks
of undercover work.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.375
Maybe<i> you</i> should
write a book, G.

01:16.377 --> 01:20.612
<i> 7 Highly Effective Habits</i>
<i> of Arms Dealers.</i>

01:20.614 --> 01:22.581
SAM:
No,<i> Think and Grow Rich</i>

01:22.583 --> 01:24.483
<i> by Supplying</i>
<i> Mass Murderers with Guns.</i>

01:34.295 --> 01:37.096
What do you
weigh, Jimmy?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.831
BLANCHARD:
170 pounds?

01:38.833 --> 01:41.100
Maybe a buck-80?

01:41.102 --> 01:42.868
Mr. Blanchard, I-I was...

01:42.870 --> 01:44.703
It'd take
1.9 seconds

01:44.705 --> 01:46.271
for your body to
hit the pavement

01:46.273 --> 01:48.140
after being thrown
from the 19th floor

01:48.142 --> 01:50.342
of a tower...

01:50.344 --> 01:51.710
just like
this one.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.181
SAM:
You got this, G?

01:56.183 --> 01:57.316
What?
(gunfire)

01:57.318 --> 01:59.218
(glass shattering,
people screaming)

01:59.220 --> 02:00.819
(woman screams)

02:02.623 --> 02:04.189
(screaming continues)

02:07.495 --> 02:08.594
Down on the ground!

02:08.596 --> 02:09.661
Sit down!

02:09.663 --> 02:11.163
What the hell is this?

02:11.165 --> 02:12.331
Get over
here!

02:12.333 --> 02:14.366
This is me
giving orders to peons.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.502
Hands up, big shot.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.237
Hands up! Put 'em
where I can see 'em!

02:18.239 --> 02:19.838
Easy, easy!
Don't shoot!

02:26.680 --> 02:28.714
Shut up and move!

02:28.716 --> 02:30.849
Keep going,
keep going, move!

02:30.851 --> 02:32.618
Move, move!

02:32.620 --> 02:33.619
Shut up!

02:33.621 --> 02:35.554
(static)

02:40.728 --> 02:41.793
Let's go!

02:41.795 --> 02:44.696
(shouting)

02:44.698 --> 02:45.764
Move, move!

02:52.239 --> 02:53.472
(crying):
Please. Oh, God, please

02:53.474 --> 02:55.274
don't shoot me.
Okay? I'm sorry.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.309
I said shut up!
All right?
I'm sorry...

02:58.546 --> 02:59.745
(screams)

02:59.747 --> 03:00.779
(hostages screaming)

03:00.781 --> 03:03.248
MAN:
Everybody,
on in the back, now!

03:03.250 --> 03:06.318
Negotiating's
a bad idea.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.487
You don't negotiate like me.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.822
Get off me.

03:10.824 --> 03:11.823
MAN:
Get back now!

03:11.825 --> 03:12.891
Hey, buddy.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.794
I don't think you
know who I am.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.729
We can cut a deal.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.730
(gunshot)

03:18.732 --> 03:20.799
(screaming)

03:20.801 --> 03:21.967
Aah!

03:21.969 --> 03:26.471
You think that we can be bought?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.210
This is our currency.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.477
(gunshots)

03:32.479 --> 03:35.480
(hostages screaming)

03:55.869 --> 03:57.936
(grunting)

03:58.806 --> 03:59.805
Morning.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.740
What's up, partner?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.475
(Deeks grunting)

04:03.477 --> 04:04.943
What are you wearing?

04:04.945 --> 04:05.944
No training today?

04:05.946 --> 04:08.280
I can't hold
up the...

04:08.282 --> 04:09.281
(grunts)

04:09.283 --> 04:10.882
...Crush Crew all by myself.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.520
Crush Crew...

04:15.522 --> 04:16.922
is in session.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.023
(grunts)

04:18.025 --> 04:19.491
Yeah, but just to clarify,

04:19.493 --> 04:21.760
you're not really
crushing anything.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.562
I'm meditating.
Ha!

04:23.564 --> 04:25.297
You mean you're
sleeping.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.999
Doctor's orders, actually.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.934
I've got
adrenal fatigue.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.603
My body produces too much
adrenaline and then runs out.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.039
Yeah, but the Crush Crew lives
on adrenaline, because we...

04:34.041 --> 04:36.041
Oh, I see what you're saying.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.010
Fighting
bad guys,

04:38.012 --> 04:40.912
getting in car chases and
shootouts every single week...

04:40.914 --> 04:42.314
I just have
to find

04:42.316 --> 04:46.018
a less stressful way
of solving my problems.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.886
(humming):
Om...

04:47.888 --> 04:50.522
Yeah, like training to crush
bad guys with your mind?

04:50.524 --> 04:51.690
Aah!

04:51.692 --> 04:53.025
Ow, yah, God...

04:53.027 --> 04:55.427
All right, that's a human
resources violation.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.962
I'm gonna fill out some forms,
there's gonna be consequences.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.897
You were in my energy sphere.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.932
Ah, God, I love
your metaphors so much.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.834
It was an allegory, actually.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.403
(clears throat)

05:04.405 --> 05:05.871
Granger wants you both
in Ops now.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.806
It's Callen.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.010
This just went online.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.713
This is our currency.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.682
(gunshots)

05:16.684 --> 05:17.816
(screaming)

05:21.689 --> 05:22.954
We demand 100 freedom fighters

05:22.956 --> 05:25.390
be released from Guantanamo Bay

05:25.392 --> 05:27.759
or we shoot a hostage
every hour.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.762
Unless you want to learn
the true meaning of jihad,

05:30.764 --> 05:33.498
don't attempt any rescue.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.801
NELL: The State Department
received a list

05:35.803 --> 05:37.769
of the so-called
"freedom fighters."

05:37.771 --> 05:39.671
It's an all-star team

05:39.673 --> 05:41.873
of the most deadly terrorists
in U.S. custody.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.675
Run that back, Eric.

05:45.813 --> 05:49.081
First casualty
look familiar?

05:49.083 --> 05:50.615
Yeah, that's Tom Blanchard,

05:50.617 --> 05:52.818
the arms dealer
Callen's investigating.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.920
That was supposed
to be a routine op, though.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.989
This "routine op" just turned
into a hostage crisis.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.725
ERIC: Sam checked in
from a pay phone.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.427
I just confirmed
that all comms inside the tower

06:02.429 --> 06:03.895
have gone dark.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.030
Looks like they set
up a jamming device.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.631
NELL:
A tower that big,

06:06.633 --> 06:08.900
we're probably looking
at 15, 20 guys. Maybe more.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.303
All right, the terrorists
didn't ID themselves.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.705
Most radicals would milk
the exposure for all it's worth.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.907
It's an anomaly.
This is a huge play

06:15.909 --> 06:17.909
none of the cells on our radar
would be able to pull off.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.979
So, suddenly, Callen's
investigation becomes<i> Die Hard</i>

06:20.981 --> 06:22.114
and the person
he's targeting

06:22.116 --> 06:23.915
becomes the first
hostage killed?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.817
I mean, either Blanchard knew
these guys from before

06:25.819 --> 06:28.019
or that is
a stunning coincidence.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.554
ERIC: Blanchard sold
weapons to half

06:29.556 --> 06:30.789
the jihadists on the planet.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.124
I'm sifting through
his known associates,

06:32.126 --> 06:34.025
but it's gonna take some time.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.927
Please tell me Callen is armed.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.396
That's a negative.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.864
Uh, Wyatt Tower's
no Fort Knox,

06:38.866 --> 06:41.867
but they still have
metal detectors in the lobby.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.002
Manned by a rent-a-cop
who didn't have the wherewithal

06:44.004 --> 06:46.171
to look inside the terrorists'
toolbox when they came to work.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.839
Where's LAPD
in all of this?

06:47.841 --> 06:48.840
GRANGER:
They're waiting on us.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.876
You and Deeks link up with Sam.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.878
Find a way inside
and locate Callen.

06:52.880 --> 06:57.883
Gather intel for LAPD's hostage
rescue team before their breach.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.017
We have less than one hour

06:59.019 --> 07:00.852
before they execute
the next victim.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.687
Yippee-ki-yay.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.796
WOMAN (sobbing):
I don't want to die.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.564
Please stop.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.099
Please, please...
Please stop.
MAN:
Hey!

07:14.101 --> 07:15.934
Hey, leave
her alone!

07:15.936 --> 07:17.002
(grunting)

07:21.041 --> 07:22.507
Don't.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.943
(grunts)

07:24.945 --> 07:27.212
(hostages scream)

07:27.214 --> 07:28.880
MAN:
Mall cop.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.851
(groans)

07:32.853 --> 07:34.553
You. Sit down.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.523
(groans)

07:38.525 --> 07:39.691
You okay?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.026
Mm-hmm.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.227
It's my chest.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.695
Left side hurts.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.162
Well, you might have
broken some ribs.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.065
Your lung's intact.
You're gonna be all right.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.834
Well, what a relief.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.036
Mail guy says I'm gonna survive.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.103
I'm Don.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.772
Thanks for looking out.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.174
I need to know if there's
any weapons in this building.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.776
Maybe a supply closet

07:57.778 --> 07:59.244
in the security office?
Who the hell are you?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.646
I'm Jimmy the mail guy.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.984
Management made this
a "gun-free zone."

08:05.986 --> 08:08.053
We can't carry firearms
on the job.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.521
I'm so sorry, Don.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.022
I'm so sorry.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.991
Oh...

08:12.993 --> 08:13.959
Any shortness of breath?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.961
I'm fine.
Don't get macho

08:15.963 --> 08:17.613
on me, Don.
What's wrong, Karen?

08:17.614 --> 08:19.264
You don't trust
the mail guy's diagnosis?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.534
I took an EMT class
in college, all right?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.569
Dr. Karen Ward.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.971
Pleasure's all mine, Jimmy.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.138
Ow.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.273
Have I met you?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.708
No.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.043
You were too busy
kissing Blanchard's ass

08:32.045 --> 08:34.813
to notice any other tenants
on the 19th floor.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.982
You're gonna be okay.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.149
Just hold on.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.518
Can I talk to you?

08:39.520 --> 08:42.087
WOMAN:
Let me look at you.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.121
Are you okay?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.092
Don's not gonna be fine.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.094
I can't do anything
about his internal bleeding.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.162
I thought I'd keep
his spirits up.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.632
Got anything to keep
<i> my</i> spirits up?

08:53.634 --> 08:56.735
This isn't as bad
as it looks.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.004
Being taken hostage
by Islamic radicals

08:59.006 --> 09:01.006
is my definition of bad.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.541
Yeah, well,
real radicals

09:02.543 --> 09:06.244
don't hang half their
propaganda posters upside down.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.613
Nice meeting
you, Dr. Ward.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.286
Only other entrances
are sealed.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.755
This one leads to
a traffic cam blind spot.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.790
That's ideal
for a getaway.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.824
They got two guards
posted at the door.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.827
Satellite phone. Should work.

09:22.829 --> 09:26.097
Sat phones... it's hard for them
to get a signal inside.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.832
All right, so we
dig up some intel,

09:27.834 --> 09:30.268
and dangle me out the window.
I'll call it in.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.671
Good luck with that.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.039
(sighs)
Let's move.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.783
(grunts)

09:46.186 --> 09:47.953
(grunts)

09:50.958 --> 09:53.124
You got your adrenaline
pumping yet?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.125
A little more
than that.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.895
DEEKS:
Service entrance
is clear.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.300
Guys, we got a problem.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.768
What'd you find?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.971
It's a detonator switch.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.105
DEEKS:
What?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.113
SAM:
Det cord,
a lot of it.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.991
SAM:
Kensi?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.225
Call off
NCIS,

10:27.227 --> 10:29.661
FBI, LAPD, all the units
in the city.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.230
Call off all
rescue attempts.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.801
This building's been
wired to explode.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.016
Hetty cut
her lunch meeting short.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.150
She'll be here soon enough.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.952
Where was lunch?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.954
Nicaragua.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.255
Bring me up to speed.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.858
Well, Sam says
the tower support beams

10:59.860 --> 11:01.026
have been rigged
with explosives.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.694
Geez.
Yeah.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.829
Tactical breach could cause
the hostage takers to panic,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.331
bring down the whole building.
Even though

11:06.333 --> 11:09.934
it's a Saturday, there's still
approximately 100 people inside.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.770
And that's not
factoring in possible casualties

11:11.772 --> 11:13.204
outside the tower
if it collapses.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.207
Restrict LAPD to evacuating
the neighborhood.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.943
Sir, who's gonna
back up our team?

11:18.945 --> 11:21.713
No one, Ms. Jones.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.917
Defused bomb's
in the loading dock.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.385
Rest could be anywhere
in the tower.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.720
All right,

11:28.722 --> 11:29.954
so LAPD is standing down

11:29.956 --> 11:31.756
until we give them
the go-ahead to move in.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.124
FOREMAN:
Team Two missed
their check-in. Find them.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.093
I'm with the hostages on 16.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.068
16th floor

11:43.070 --> 11:44.202
is unleased office space.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.336
KENSI: The cameras
have been disabled,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.238
elevators, too.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.241
It's gonna slow down any attempt
of a hostage escape.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.911
Yeah, but the flip side
of that

11:52.913 --> 11:56.014
is 23 floors is
a lot of stairways to cover.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.883
It means the guard duty
is gonna be spread thin.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.118
Infiltrate the hostage group.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.453
Figure out what
we're working with.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.021
Avoid the east stairs.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.289
They're closest
to that service entrance.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.790
On it.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.892
Sam, where you headed?
To find Callen.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.728
How do you know
he's not with the hostages?

12:09.730 --> 12:12.997
Because wolves never linger
around sheep for long.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.034
Let's go.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.075
You think they're serious
about executing a hostage

12:24.077 --> 12:25.243
once every hour?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.346
They seem serious to me.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.517
Where the hell have you been?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.419
Two men down
at the east service entrance.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.754
Flex-cuffed,
stripped of their radios

12:35.756 --> 12:37.155
and detonators.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.923
We've got company.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.093
Time to improvise.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.294
Come with me. Let's go.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.363
You, too, let's go.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.447
Fresh intel on Blanchard.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.317
Looks like
credit card records

13:05.318 --> 13:07.085
over the past two weeks
turned up some hits

13:07.087 --> 13:08.953
we didn't get
in our initial profile.

13:08.955 --> 13:09.988
Great.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.207
I was just about to update
my blog

13:12.208 --> 13:14.425
on dining and shopping hot spots
for the high-end arms dealer.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.527
Well, here we go.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.395
Tiffany's, Spago,

13:17.397 --> 13:19.297
Beverly Wilshire Hotel,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.132
La Perla.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.500
Either he liked jewelry,
fine dining

13:22.502 --> 13:24.169
and wearing lady's lingerie...

13:24.171 --> 13:27.138
Or Blanchard had a girlfriend.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.007
One who liked $800 panties.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.042
"Panties"?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.577
Yeah, I've heard about La Perla.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.879
Okay, well, they're not $800.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.282
Oh, how do you know that,
Ms. Jones?

13:38.518 --> 13:41.920
How do you think I'd know,
Mr. Beale?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.523
I'm gonna...

13:45.525 --> 13:48.092
mine Blanchard's
phone logs and, um,

13:48.094 --> 13:50.195
see if I can have some agents
bring his girlfriend

13:50.197 --> 13:51.262
to the boatshed for questioning.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.363
You do that.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.431
I'll let Granger know.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.166
Okay.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.210
Tell me you know something.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.978
There's nothing
on the cameras.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.079
Whoever it is, they're good.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.415
Probably a two-
to-four-man group.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.183
Pull our men from 16.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.735
I want teams

14:13.736 --> 14:15.286
grid-searching
this entire building.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.556
Who's gonna watch the hostages?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.226
Send in Crom.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.382
That was all too easy.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.151
There's hardly anybody
watchdogging the hostages.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.653
(sighs)

14:48.655 --> 14:51.189
We got this.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.195
KENSI:
Okay,

14:57.197 --> 14:59.264
that guy might become
a problem.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.367
At least he's not bulletproof.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.502
Uh-oh.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.170
There's enough C-4
in that vest

15:06.172 --> 15:08.406
to vaporize everybody in here.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.910
(beeping)

15:11.912 --> 15:14.312
And that's a dead man switch.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.381
(beeping)

15:17.584 --> 15:19.050
It's connected
to the explosives

15:19.052 --> 15:20.551
lining the walls
and support beams.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.520
Colossus takes his finger
off that button,

15:22.522 --> 15:26.257
and this whole building becomes
a pile of rubble and bodies.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.995
Looks like
he's bulletproof after all.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.170
Anything in the financials?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.939
No. If Blanchard knew,
we'll never find out.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.074
You killed him too fast.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.575
Don't question my orders.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
You can be a hostage, too.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.619
All you got to do
is say the word.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.488
I got plenty of bullets.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.557
You, back to work.

16:00.694 --> 16:01.960
KAREN:
Don't touch me!

16:03.096 --> 16:04.462
Stop it!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.264
Please, please, please,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.433
I can explain.
MAN: Sir.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.436
What is this?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.570
She slipped away
from the others.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.138
We caught her trying
to get away.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.406
No, I wasn't trying to escape.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.142
Listen, just let me explain.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.644
FOREMAN:
Get that camera running.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.246
(whimpering)

16:22.248 --> 16:23.748
KAREN: Please, there is
something you need to know.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.650
CALLEN:
Stop! It was my fault!

16:27.487 --> 16:28.619
Boy, you sure

16:28.621 --> 16:30.655
get around for a mail guy.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.557
I-I convinced her to sneak out
and find a working phone.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.158
It was my idea.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.493
She had nothing to do with this.
It was all my fault.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.328
D-Don't hurt her.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.763
I guess I'll just have
to kill both of you.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.700
KAREN:
Jimmy!

16:46.373 --> 16:47.572
(gunshots)

16:56.483 --> 16:57.715
Go, go, go, go!

17:05.625 --> 17:07.125
Two of them got away.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.260
One of them was in charge.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.497
There was a woman.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.631
Karen.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.665
She ran.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.434
She was scared;
can you blame her?

17:16.436 --> 17:18.236
I hope she ran fast.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.638
Well, on the bright side,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.607
I figured out
my New Year's resolution.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.674
I'm never going undercover

17:23.676 --> 17:26.444
as Jimmy the mail guy again.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.279
Jimmy the mail guy went postal.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.681
They're not real jihadists.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.217
They didn't even take the time
to detonate their suicide vests.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.087
They still rigged
the building to blow.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.289
Then we can't call their bluff.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.293
Blanchard's financial records.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.329
He was targeted.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.132
Had something they wanted.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.735
This whole hostage thing
could be one big ruse.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.070
FOREMAN:
Two shooters in the boardroom.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.337
All teams move in.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.441
I want them dead now.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.775
They're sending in the cavalry.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.111
Then let's go hunting.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.123
FOREMAN:
Everybody to the 23rd floor.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.224
23rd floor.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.425
Guys, we got to go.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.560
Crom, stay here.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.664
Go!
KENSI:
They're getting skittish.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.166
They're moving manpower a lot
faster than they should.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.568
Sam must have found Callen.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.571
Well, the good news is
there's only one terrorist

18:26.573 --> 18:27.772
watching the hostages.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.841
And the bad news is
he's a walking WMD.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.275
(sighs)

18:31.277 --> 18:32.743
There's got to be
a way to disarm the wiring

18:32.745 --> 18:34.712
in the support beams.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.848
I would take a closer look
at the wiring,

18:36.850 --> 18:38.616
upload some pictures to Ops

18:38.618 --> 18:40.284
and see if they got someone
to walk me through the disarm.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.220
Okay, go now, go now.
You gonna wish me luck?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.588
(grunts)

19:00.240 --> 19:02.406
(wire clicks)

19:02.408 --> 19:03.608
(gasps)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.778
(indistinct shouting)

19:13.520 --> 19:16.354
(rapid gunshots)

19:25.698 --> 19:27.865
Keep it moving!

19:32.572 --> 19:34.539
Sit your ass down.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.477
(shutter clicking)

20:06.439 --> 20:08.506
¶ ¶

20:13.780 --> 20:16.614
Yes, I dated Tom Blanchard.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.583
No, I didn't really like him.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.984
Well, speaking ill of the dead
ain't a great way

20:19.986 --> 20:21.786
to make a first impression,
Ms. Welsley.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.621
I didn't like Tom,

20:23.623 --> 20:24.722
but most people despised him.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.757
So it was actually
a compliment.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.759
Why was he despised?

20:28.761 --> 20:31.862
Everyone despises success
if it's not their own.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.365
He got rich selling weapons
to drug cartels

20:34.367 --> 20:36.534
and sex traffickers.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.904
You didn't know that?

20:39.906 --> 20:43.241
I know the places he took me
and the gifts he bought me.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.409
I know I make plenty
of money on my own,

20:45.411 --> 20:47.378
but getting courted
by a mysterious man?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.447
It's always a fun ride.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.650
Well, it says here you were
Blanchard's real estate agent.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.452
Yeah, met him
about a month ago.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.786
He was looking
for office space.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.521
He ever mention his work?

20:57.523 --> 20:58.723
Project he was working on?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.358
Deal he was looking to close?
No.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.426
Tom never talked about his work.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.528
But you're not sad.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.397
I guess I'm more...

21:06.399 --> 21:07.732
chilled.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.868
Tom coveted that office
and then he died there.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.338
(chuckles) He was a classic
pain-in-the-ass client.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.906
The only lease
he'd even consider

21:15.908 --> 21:17.541
was that exact spot.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.543
Wyatt Tower?

21:19.545 --> 21:21.746
No, even more specific
than that.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.948
He had to have an office on
the 19th floor of Wyatt Tower.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.720
(line ringing)

21:29.722 --> 21:32.089
ERIC:
<i> The only other business</i>

21:32.090 --> 21:34.457
on the 19th floor of Wyatt Tower
is Gamma Grade Pharmaceuticals.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.860
They maintain a storage lab

21:35.862 --> 21:37.461
right next
to Blanchard's office.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.563
Now, why would

21:39.565 --> 21:42.566
a La Perla-buying arms dealer
move right next door?

21:42.568 --> 21:44.635
Let me call Callen and Sam.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.705
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Satellite signal unavailable.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.873
The customer
you are trying to reach

21:48.875 --> 21:50.975
is out of service range.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.810
Satellite signal unavailable.
Great.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.527
Damn.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.895
Come on, baby.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.963
Come on.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.503
Come on.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.905
Damn it.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.579
Yeah, that's a terrible idea,
let's do that.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.423
Come on.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.961
Come on.

22:43.963 --> 22:44.929
MAN:
Check that one.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.097
MAN 2:
Yeah.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.365
Son of a bitch.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.002
All right.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.671
Come on, baby.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.139
Come on, technology.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.546
Hey.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.881
Are you okay?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.616
Yeah, I'm okay.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.988
Bastard's got to weigh
270 pounds.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.559
I was thinking
more 280.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.561
You got sharp
eyes there, Don.

23:17.563 --> 23:21.565
Put in 18 years
at the Detroit PD.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.168
Moved to L.A.
for the weather.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.171
This happened
on my watch.

23:28.674 --> 23:29.974
This isn't your fault.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.810
These guys are
professionals.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.712
You are, too,
I reckon.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.714
You're too squared away
to be LAPD,

23:36.716 --> 23:38.949
so I figure
some kind of Fed.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.556
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.558
Listen, I understand
you can't tell me.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.193
Just know that
I'm here to help.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.997
Anything else those sharp eyes
see that I should know about?

23:52.999 --> 23:55.166
Yeah, big man
limps slightly.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.734
Probably an old
football injury.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.837
Blew out his right knee,
never healed properly.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.841
Thank you.

24:03.842 --> 24:06.009
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.018
The rest of the floor's clear.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.753
Don't know where else
they could be.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.089
(phone rings)

24:24.597 --> 24:27.465
(phone rings)

24:27.467 --> 24:29.600
What the hell?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.671
Thought we jammed
all the phones.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.006
Check that out.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.975
It's a timer.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.644
It's not an incoming call.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.680
(screams)

24:49.655 --> 24:51.055
This one's
still alive.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.138
Who are you?

25:08.140 --> 25:10.875
This wasn't what we thought.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.776
What was "this" supposed to be?

25:12.778 --> 25:15.579
Corporate hostages,
corporate ransom.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.715
Get in, get out.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.116
What about Blanchard?

25:19.118 --> 25:23.120
They didn't tell us.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.189
This wasn't what was
supposed to happen.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.227
Northern Irish.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.997
It's an Ulster brogue.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.065
(phone rings)

25:37.003 --> 25:38.769
Damn it, there's
barely a signal. Eric?

25:38.771 --> 25:39.770
ERIC (broken connection):
Sam.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.838
Signal's cutting out.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.072
Eric?!

25:42.074 --> 25:43.807
I've got new intel.

25:43.809 --> 25:44.975
Gamma Grade Pharmaceutical...

25:44.977 --> 25:46.644
19th floor storage lab...

25:46.646 --> 25:48.646
Blanchard's been targeting it
all along.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.215
Roger. I'm gonna try to upload
a pic for facial rec now.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.818
Let's go.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.758
Whew.
(line ringing)

26:00.760 --> 26:02.092
Oh, my God.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.794
NELL: Deeks?
Nell?!

26:03.796 --> 26:04.929
(breaking in and out):
Nell... hear me...

26:04.931 --> 26:06.163
Deeks, is that you?

26:06.165 --> 26:07.932
(phone beeps)
Can you hear me now?!

26:07.934 --> 26:10.935
Yeah, roger that,
we can hear you.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.803
(laughs)

26:12.805 --> 26:14.805
Hey, I'm uploading some pics.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.808
I need you to, uh... oh, my God.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.777
I need you to walk me
through a disarm.

26:19.779 --> 26:20.911
We got some explosive wire.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.246
I'm on it.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.681
MAN: Check it.
(door opens)

26:24.884 --> 26:26.884
Son of a... okay.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.359
MAN:
You hear the traffic?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.694
Someone shot out a window here.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.362
MAN (over radio):
I need backup on 21.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.731
We're losing too many men.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.166
(with brogue):
Forget this.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.767
We got to move.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.306
Only one of us needs
to get out of here alive.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.975
You remember that.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.810
Sir...

26:54.780 --> 26:58.349
Don't nag me
about the bloody accent.

26:58.351 --> 27:01.218
It's a little late for that now.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.287
(watch beeps)

27:06.058 --> 27:07.725
Tool's almost rebooted.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.793
We can get back to work
in a few minutes.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.128
Right.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.630
Let's go.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.667
(phone buzzes)

27:19.872 --> 27:21.939
Oh, nice work, Nell.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.077
SAM:
Clear.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.918
Clear.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.224
SAM: This is a serious piece
of hardware.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.030
Looks like someone tried

27:46.032 --> 27:48.732
to bypass the biometrics
with brute force.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.317
It was working.

27:50.318 --> 27:51.901
They're just waiting
for the diamond drill bit

27:51.904 --> 27:54.204
to cool down so they can
come back and finish the job.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.374
I saw this type of glass years
ago at a basement in Langley.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.376
It's a palladium
micro-alloy.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.345
Chemically-sealed
metallic glass.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.847
It's a dead end, G.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.282
(door beeps)

28:22.835 --> 28:24.968
Thanks for saving
my life, Jimmy.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.370
Name's not Jimmy.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.871
It's Callen.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.106
Is that a first
or last name?

28:29.108 --> 28:30.274
It's a long story.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.442
Why are you here, Karen?

28:31.444 --> 28:33.110
I work here.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.295
Not during a hostage crisis.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.479
Why'd you risk your life
to come back?

28:35.481 --> 28:39.149
I know why they
seized the tower.

28:39.151 --> 28:42.152
From the moment it happened, I
knew it could only be one thing.

28:42.154 --> 28:45.823
When they caught me sneaking
out, I wasn't trying to escape.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.725
I was trying to
make it back here.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.394
We're federal agents,
we need to know what's here.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.931
It was supposed
to be a vaccine.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.933
I helped create it.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.968
I'll die before I
let anyone take it.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.204
Gamma Grade was
developing a vaccine,

29:00.206 --> 29:01.872
then there was an accident
along the way.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.807
Instead, they got a virus.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.442
I wish it was
only a virus.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.145
It's a bioweapon.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.226
NELL:
Dr. Ward's story checks out.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.394
Gamma Grade
Pharmaceuticals reported

29:24.396 --> 29:27.030
that their vaccine
research went wrong.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.167
Project's in-house
name was "SPIRAL."

29:30.169 --> 29:33.303
ERIC: They were scheduled to
deliver all 25 vials of SPIRAL

29:33.305 --> 29:35.139
to the CDC
tomorrow morning.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.074
The heist had
to go down today.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.409
Blanchard had sources.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.945
By the time the news about
SPIRAL reached the CDC,

29:41.947 --> 29:43.347
could have been a dozen leaks.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.315
NELL: Well, thanks
to the photo you sent us,

29:45.317 --> 29:48.318
we have a pretty good idea
of who he was working with.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.154
Name is Liam Boyle.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.288
He's suspected
of two unsolved murders

29:51.290 --> 29:53.323
on behalf of the Celtic Militia.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.309
They're a fringe sect

29:55.310 --> 29:57.294
that broke off from the
Irish Republican Army in 2011.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.396
Why'd they split?

29:59.397 --> 30:01.497
The IRA deemed the Celts
"too radical."

30:01.500 --> 30:03.333
So Blanchard had
a buyer for SPIRAL,

30:03.335 --> 30:04.868
but then they turned on him.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.037
Cut out the middleman,
went for the heist instead.

30:07.039 --> 30:10.440
Threw up a jihadist smoke screen
to cover their tracks.

30:10.442 --> 30:14.178
We can't allow SPIRAL
to leave that lab, gentlemen.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.846
How bad is it?

30:15.848 --> 30:18.081
Think Ebola
on steroids.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.184
Be more specific.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.353
After exposure, it's fatal
within 72 hours.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.490
But unlike Ebola,
SPIRAL's an airborne contagion.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.592
It can be passed on
like the common cold.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.594
Any word from Kensi and Deeks?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.129
They're gonna make a play

30:32.131 --> 30:34.431
at disarming the explosives
threatening the tower.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.368
Well, we did send Deeks
to that EOD course

30:38.370 --> 30:40.103
at Quantico last month.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.072
How'd he do?

30:42.074 --> 30:45.976
You failed that EOD test
at Quantico last month.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.145
That was just practice.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.414
Deeks doesn't even show up
until game day.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.483
I got this.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.485
Just make sure Bane's
looking the other direction.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.321
Oh, really?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.156
And who has your back
while I'm doing that?

30:59.158 --> 31:01.358
His buddies could show up
through the door any minute now.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.960
I can help.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.195
You can help? Who are you?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.330
I'm head of security.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.198
I know everyone
in this room.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.333
I owe them this much.

31:09.335 --> 31:12.202
I just need, like, 90 seconds.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.504
I'll cover the door.

31:19.478 --> 31:20.477
Get back!

31:20.479 --> 31:21.478
Everyone, back!

31:21.480 --> 31:23.113
Get back!

31:25.084 --> 31:26.083
(groans)

31:26.085 --> 31:27.217
Oh, my chest.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.086
Oh, God.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.487
Oh, my God, I
need some air.
Don?!

31:30.489 --> 31:33.357
(groans)

31:33.359 --> 31:34.558
Don!
Oh, my God.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.261
Don't! Stop right there!

31:37.263 --> 31:38.328
Sit down!

31:38.330 --> 31:39.363
Sit down!

31:39.365 --> 31:41.231
(groaning):
My chest.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.366
I think he's having
a heart attack.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.067
He needs help.
No one moves!

31:44.069 --> 31:45.469
Or I'll blow
this place up!

31:45.471 --> 31:47.271
WOMAN:
Do something, please!

31:51.110 --> 31:53.377
All right--
red, yellow, black, right?

31:53.379 --> 31:55.279
Is it yellow, red, black?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.613
What are you just standing
there for? He's dying!

31:56.615 --> 31:58.499
Can you just
do something?!

31:58.500 --> 32:00.384
Yellow, red, black. Yellow, red,
black. Yellow, red, black.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.985
Son of a bitch.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.656
Trust your training.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.494
Come on, baby.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.664
Oh, thank God.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.502
Get back in there
with the others!

32:22.274 --> 32:24.141
I was briefed
on the plane.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.475
Good, because I need
to make a call...

32:25.477 --> 32:27.110
I disagree.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.012
You didn't even
let me finish.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.014
You need to call
SECNAV, right?

32:31.016 --> 32:32.983
And tell her
about SPIRAL.

32:32.985 --> 32:36.053
Then SECNAV will call
the White House,

32:36.055 --> 32:38.388
and they'll
scramble F-35s

32:38.390 --> 32:42.659
to incinerate that virus
with Hellfire missiles.

32:42.661 --> 32:46.096
There is a bioweapon
inside that tower.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.335
Neutralizing SPIRAL means
sacrificing everyone in there.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.203
I know.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.705
Then, what do you disagree with?

32:54.707 --> 32:57.274
It's my team

32:57.276 --> 32:59.509
in the tower, Owen.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.445
And if anyone

33:01.447 --> 33:04.281
is going to make
that phone call,

33:04.283 --> 33:06.516
I am.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.461
How long would it take you to
get rid of every vial of SPIRAL?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.996
Uh, longer than you think.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.630
It's not like tossing out
the trash.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.432
(clattering)

33:22.434 --> 33:24.167
MAN: Move it now!
They're coming.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.435
Don't bother.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.636
Another five minutes
of drilling,

33:26.638 --> 33:27.571
they'll be inside anyway.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.206
You want to leave it open?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.142
Destroy as many vials as
you can.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.543
We'll take care of the rest.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.050
CROM:
That's enough!

33:40.052 --> 33:42.085
Back to the other room now,
you heard me!

33:43.589 --> 33:45.389
Explosion chain defused.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.158
Get out of the way!
Okay, sir, please don't kill me.
Sir.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.493
Quit whining, old man!
Please.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.660
Let's make sure
that suicide vest

33:50.662 --> 33:52.195
doesn't take out
the whole floor.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.397
Crush Crew on deck?

33:53.399 --> 33:54.765
Mm-hmm.
Rock and roll.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.700
One, two, three.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.103
(gunshot)

34:21.427 --> 34:23.193
DON:
Hey!

34:28.667 --> 34:30.534
(beeping, screaming)

34:34.640 --> 34:37.274
Was that Crom?

34:37.276 --> 34:39.810
Focus on SPIRAL.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.645
Wait.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.480
The door's already open.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.683
(gunshots)

34:57.763 --> 35:00.230
Call it in before an F-35 drops
a bomb on our heads.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.699
(line ringing)

35:02.701 --> 35:04.167
Sam?

35:04.169 --> 35:06.103
Sam, we've been trying
to reach you.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.671
I've got some new intel...
SPIRAL is secure.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.705
I say again,

35:08.707 --> 35:09.706
SPIRAL is secure.
We're good.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.542
I'll tell Hetty and Granger.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.144
Phew.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.745
For a moment there, I thought
you guys were going to, uh...

35:15.747 --> 35:17.214
What's the other intel?

35:17.216 --> 35:18.515
Um, yeah.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.501
Dr. Karen Ward.

35:20.502 --> 35:22.486
She's worked at Gamma Grade
for the past two months.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.522
Uh, facial rec
on her Wyatt ID card

35:25.524 --> 35:28.358
shows a near match
to a woman arrested

35:28.360 --> 35:29.726
at a Celtic Militia protest

35:29.728 --> 35:31.695
in Ulster four years ago.

35:31.697 --> 35:35.132
Sam? Sam?

35:39.438 --> 35:43.173
(with brogue):
Looks like your partner's
figured some things out, Jimmy.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.311
Put the case down,

35:48.313 --> 35:50.147
or there's gonna be
three dead bodies in here.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.249
Good lads.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.317
But expendable.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.522
Shoot me,

35:58.524 --> 36:01.358
and SPIRAL kills everybody
in this building.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.394
They weren't even
told about my role.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.264
Never knew their real mission

36:07.266 --> 36:09.332
was buying me
enough time to get out.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.273
SAM:
G.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.874
G?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.710
We're all expendable.

36:20.712 --> 36:24.181
Just some of us are
more expendable than others.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.623
Sorry, Jimmy.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.896
(coughing)

37:08.493 --> 37:10.460
Finish it.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.232
(coughing)

37:22.541 --> 37:24.441
You all right?

37:24.443 --> 37:25.609
(groans)
You okay?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.744
Yeah, I survived.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.846
You just saved everybody here.

37:29.848 --> 37:30.947
You know that, right?

37:30.949 --> 37:32.515
(sighs)

37:32.517 --> 37:34.651
What I know is that...

37:34.652 --> 37:36.786
whatever agency you work for
owes me free drinks for life.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.955
Yeah, well,
the first round's on me.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.390
Let's get you
against the wall.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.791
Thank you.
KENSI: Everyone's doing okay?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.426
(groans)

37:43.428 --> 37:45.562
So, I shut off
the jamming systems.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.431
Communications are back online,
and, uh, LAPD is pulling up now.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.333
(phone rings)
Nice work.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.335
Sam?

37:52.337 --> 37:54.471
Kens, I need a CDC unit for
Callen on the 19th floor now.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.705
Nobody leaves this tower.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.007
I want the ground floor
locked off.

37:57.009 --> 37:58.942
LAPD is on it. Where are you?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.011
The roof.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.751
(gunshots)

38:09.421 --> 38:11.054
(helicopter blades whirring)

38:22.934 --> 38:24.434
SAM:
Drop the case!

38:25.437 --> 38:27.437
(grunting)

38:54.499 --> 38:56.499
He didn't even
think twice

38:56.501 --> 38:58.568
about locking
himself inside.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.840
You'd have done the same thing.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.710
All of you.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.779
I didn't think
it would end like this.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.816
I've seen the end, Mr. Hanna.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.920
This is not the end.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.130
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

39:27.132 --> 39:29.399
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

39:35.941 --> 39:38.975
WOMAN (quietly):
You can see quite an improvement
just in the last two days.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.610
Right here,
if you look on the chart.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.982
Where are we?

39:46.952 --> 39:48.952
Excuse me.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.488
(sighs)

39:51.490 --> 39:53.523
Druid Hills, Georgia.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.859
CDC headquarters.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.798
How...?

40:01.800 --> 40:04.968
Blanchard told the Celtic
Militia about SPIRAL.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.003
He didn't tell them
Gamma Grade Pharmaceuticals

40:07.005 --> 40:09.072
already had an antidote.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.907
Can't sell a bioweapon
with a cure.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.142
He tried to
double-cross them,

40:12.144 --> 40:15.178
but Karen's people
crossed him first.

40:16.148 --> 40:17.747
Everyone okay?

40:17.749 --> 40:20.450
Yeah.

40:21.753 --> 40:25.054
The last thing I remember
seeing back there was Hetty.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.492
And now...

40:29.494 --> 40:33.129
I wake up and... here you are.

40:37.702 --> 40:41.805
All those things I thought
I regretted, you know...

40:41.807 --> 40:44.574
your singing in the car,

40:44.576 --> 40:47.911
pretending to like Michelle's
Sunday night casserole.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.679
I can sing, G.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.514
Don't make me prove it.

40:51.516 --> 40:55.218
I will fill the CDC halls
with the sound of music.

40:58.590 --> 41:02.058
I regret giving up on believing

41:02.060 --> 41:05.728
that I might meet
my dad someday.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.199
You still got time.

41:09.201 --> 41:12.502
Life's too short to regret.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.239
Thanks, Sam.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.475
For what?

41:19.945 --> 41:23.580
For making sure I didn't wake up
in Druid Hills, Georgia alone.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.150
That's what family's for.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.753
Also for not following through
on your threat

41:30.755 --> 41:34.791
to fill these halls
with the sound of your voice.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.994
Don't thank me for that
because I'm warmed up, baby.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.829
No.
(clears throat)
Yeah, yeah, I'm so warmed up

41:39.831 --> 41:41.097
right now.
No.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.932
¶ I... ¶

41:42.934 --> 41:45.168
DEEKS:
Om...

41:45.170 --> 41:46.669
There it is.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.705
That's right.
That's it.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.039
What?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.674
I'm feeling it.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.109
Feeling what?

41:53.111 --> 41:55.211
Zen, baby,
and I like it.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.880
You're disgusting.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.114
What?

41:58.116 --> 41:59.916
Why do you have to bring
sex into everything?

41:59.918 --> 42:00.984
I don't know what you're
talking about with sex.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.852
I'm talking about Zen.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.687
I'm talking about being one
with the universe here.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.189
"Zen," he says. Zen?

42:06.191 --> 42:08.758
I think I know a metaphor
when I hear one.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.993
Oh, you'll know my metaphor
when I whip it out.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.694
And there it is again.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.062
DEEKS:
I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.764
(Eric clears throat)

42:14.766 --> 42:17.066
Hi.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.601
This is not
what it looks like.

42:19.738 --> 42:20.837
What does this
even look like?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.071
You know exactly
what this is.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.741
Kensi loves whipping
out her metaphor.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.242
NELL (chuckles):
Okay. Well...

42:26.244 --> 42:28.177
good news is, Callen is going
to make a full recovery

42:28.179 --> 42:29.746
and he should be home soon.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.281
That's wonderful.
That's great news.
That's awesome.

42:31.283 --> 42:32.982
Hey, have you ever
tried group Zen?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.217
I'm sorry, what?

42:34.219 --> 42:35.985
I love group Zen.

42:35.987 --> 42:36.953
Do you?

42:36.955 --> 42:39.188
Shall we?
We shall.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.325
This might get sweaty
with multiple partners.

42:42.327 --> 42:45.061
Please stop saying things
that I can't un-see.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.596
(sighs, sputters)

42:46.598 --> 42:47.964
That's a weird way to start it.

42:47.966 --> 42:49.098
Oh, yeah, I'm in the mood.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.633
I'm totally feeling it.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.101
How you feeling, Kens?

42:52.103 --> 42:53.870
I hate you a lot.

42:53.872 --> 42:55.672
Yeah, but it's opposite day
so you love me.

42:55.674 --> 43:01.244
Om...

43:01.246 --> 43:03.246
(Kensi sighs, clears throat)

43:03.248 --> 43:05.248
ALL:
Om...
