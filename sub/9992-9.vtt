00:00.003 --> 00:04.731
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young maiden named Sara who lived in a castle far, far away.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.345
Every morning, young Sara would awaken

00:08.411 --> 00:11.949
and set about cooking and cleaning and taking care of the whole castle,

00:12.615 --> 00:15.319
and every night, she'd sit by the castle window

00:15.687 --> 00:19.194
and secretly dream of someday returning home.

00:20.361 --> 00:24.689
You see, her real home lay at the far end of the kingdom

00:24.950 --> 00:29.905
where friendly dragons still roamed the earth and rainbows appeared whether it rained or not,

00:30.285 --> 00:34.908
but deep in her heart, young Sara knew she would probably never again see her real home,

00:35.492 --> 00:38.094
for the evil ogre who held her captive,

00:38.175 --> 00:41.288
whose castle she cleaned, whose food she made,

00:41.492 --> 00:43.841
had vowed that if she ever tried to escape...

00:46.160 --> 00:48.954
he, himself would come after her.

00:49.813 --> 00:52.579
And he swore that no matter how fast she ran...

00:54.447 --> 00:56.121
or how well she hid,

00:56.751 --> 00:57.907
he would find her...

00:58.830 --> 00:59.737
and kill her.

01:01.017 --> 01:01.860
Mom?!

01:02.342 --> 01:03.238
Mom!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:51.208 --> 01:53.905
- And there was this dragon, and this rainbow.
- What's your day look like?

01:53.962 --> 01:55.596
Mom? Are you even listening to me?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.078
Just a second.

01:58.157 --> 02:00.676
Once I drop the kids off at school, I'm heading to work. Why?

02:00.741 --> 02:02.626
I was just wondering if you'd be anywhere near the cleaners, that's all.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.402
- Drop off or pickup?
- Mom!

02:04.459 --> 02:06.471
- Pick up. I'm out of clean shirts.
- Mom!

02:06.542 --> 02:08.687
- What? What is it?
- I'm trying to tell you about...

02:08.764 --> 02:10.192
I know-- your dream and I'm listening.

02:10.253 --> 02:12.523
- No, you're not.
- Yes. I am.

02:13.075 --> 02:14.842
So can you do it, or should I?

02:15.016 --> 02:16.409
- I can do it.
- Are you sure?

02:16.455 --> 02:18.063
Because I'm totally out of clean shirts.

02:18.247 --> 02:20.536
- Heard it. Got it. No clean shirts.
- Thank you.

02:22.799 --> 02:24.514
You know, if you're really worried about it,

02:24.576 --> 02:26.260
maybe you should take care of it yourself.

02:26.973 --> 02:30.484
This is completely unfair! I had her first, Dad!

02:30.557 --> 02:33.238
No. In point of fact, I did, or you wouldn't be here.

02:33.791 --> 02:36.348
You know, I would, but the dry cleaners is totally in the opposite direction

02:36.403 --> 02:38.369
from my work, and it's right on the way to yours.

02:38.431 --> 02:41.144
Yeah, I know, that's why I was thinking of changing jobs.

02:41.789 --> 02:43.663
- It's no trouble, I'll get them.
- Thank you.

02:43.741 --> 02:47.032
Okay. That's it. I'm resigning from this family.

02:47.816 --> 02:51.067
I had a dream, too. It was about animals.

02:51.144 --> 02:54.385
They were eating people. For fun.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.886
Honey, okay, there's no need to resign. I'm all yours.

02:58.266 --> 03:00.272
And that sounds like a terrible dream, sweetie.

03:00.355 --> 03:02.761
Mother, you are not listening to me at all.

03:02.838 --> 03:06.082
Yes, I am. I am listening to you and everybody else,

03:06.151 --> 03:09.248
but what I'm really worried about is we're not going to get out of here on time,

03:09.305 --> 03:11.957
and if we don't get out of here on time, you're going to miss your field trip

03:11.987 --> 03:14.648
to the Native American Museum, and we wouldn't want that, would we?

03:14.809 --> 03:15.505
Fine.

03:15.607 --> 03:17.973
Don't forget to let me sign that permission slip.

03:18.284 --> 03:19.816
I don't care.

03:19.971 --> 03:22.079
I don't care about anything!

03:22.826 --> 03:24.320
I care, Mom.

03:27.167 --> 03:28.780
Hey, you. Hey!

03:29.650 --> 03:33.050
Hey, it's a dream. This is real life. Now let's go.

03:33.158 --> 03:35.381
Wow. Send that to Ripley. He wouldn't believe it.

03:44.105 --> 03:46.573
All ashore that's going ashore.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.318
Love you, Mom.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.085
I love you, wild thing.

03:51.258 --> 03:51.989
Ariel?

03:53.722 --> 03:55.425
Why don't you believe me?

03:56.005 --> 03:57.386
But I do believe you.

03:57.678 --> 03:58.856
You had a dream.

04:00.351 --> 04:01.525
But you're awake now.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.242
There's no castle, there's no ogre.

04:06.935 --> 04:09.328
So you're telling me it doesn't mean anything.

04:09.591 --> 04:11.642
I have no way of knowing that.

04:12.132 --> 04:12.946
It's just...

04:14.257 --> 04:15.316
Most dreams...

04:16.483 --> 04:18.845
Most dreams don't mean anything.

04:19.916 --> 04:23.442
Once in a great while, certain people will have a dream, and...

04:24.246 --> 04:28.654
and then when they're awake, they'll see things in their life that remind them of their dream.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.800
Has that ever happened to you?

04:30.974 --> 04:33.017
Sure, once in a while, I'll...

04:33.252 --> 04:34.763
I'll dream something, and...

04:35.833 --> 04:37.072
it'll puzzle me.

04:37.859 --> 04:40.195
And then I'll either realize that it's nothing,

04:40.723 --> 04:46.544
or I'll start seeing things in my life that tell me this is a dream I shouldn't ignore.

04:46.651 --> 04:48.598
This is a dream that's important.

04:49.607 --> 04:50.420
Really?

04:51.026 --> 04:54.040
Really, but it's very rare.

04:55.775 --> 04:56.594
Now go.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.303
I love you, Mom.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.933
I love you, kitten.

05:04.598 --> 05:05.871
Bye, baby.

05:07.409 --> 05:11.868
Okay, gang, we're only a couple of blocks from the Native American History Museum.

05:12.974 --> 05:14.566
Now  let's go over the rules.

05:15.584 --> 05:18.760
The most important thing is that everybody stay together.

05:18.830 --> 05:21.223
Do not wander off on your own.

05:21.319 --> 05:24.715
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young maiden named Sara

05:24.771 --> 05:27.529
who lived in a castle far, far away.

05:33.884 --> 05:35.763
All right, everybody, let's go.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.737
Quickly and quietly. Follow me.

05:40.263 --> 05:44.105
Take everything off the bus. Do not leave your possessions behind.

05:44.221 --> 05:44.830
Come on.

05:47.755 --> 05:50.800
Come on. Honey, you're gonna need that jacket. It's still chilly.

05:51.036 --> 05:52.997
Okay, let's move out.

06:16.790 --> 06:17.763
Damn!

06:27.541 --> 06:29.934
- As soon as you can, and I mean first thing in the morning.
- Sorry I'm late.

06:30.062 --> 06:31.197
Did they get you on the cell?

06:31.712 --> 06:34.167
What? Who? I was in the parking structure and the elevator...

06:34.224 --> 06:35.120
Call the school.

06:44.755 --> 06:46.773
This is a dream that I shouldn't ignore.

06:47.269 --> 06:49.077
This is a dream that's important.

06:51.867 --> 06:53.357
Hey! Watch it!

06:57.566 --> 07:02.045
But deep in her heart, young Sara knew she would probably never again see her real home.

07:07.551 --> 07:11.217
How come you're standing on my property and just staring at my house?

07:12.230 --> 07:13.372
This is your house?

07:14.866 --> 07:16.189
How come you're not in school?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.251
How come you're not in school?

07:18.476 --> 07:19.603
I'm home-schooled.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.201
My mom took me out two years ago.

07:22.404 --> 07:24.164
It sucks, and I hate it.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.314
What's your excuse?

07:27.835 --> 07:29.274
So why aren't you in school?

07:30.432 --> 07:33.136
Uh, I'm, uh, looking for somebody.

07:33.273 --> 07:35.080
A... a girl.

07:35.192 --> 07:36.135
What girl?

07:38.360 --> 07:39.633
Uh,  Sara.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.658
I think that's what her name is. Sara.

07:44.559 --> 07:46.129
That's my sister's name.

07:59.899 --> 08:02.780
Okay, here's her most recent school picture. I have another one.

08:05.854 --> 08:07.225
Oh, my God.

08:07.646 --> 08:08.771
Are you all right?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.843
Did somebody hurt you? Did somebody touch you?

08:11.940 --> 08:12.912
Are you okay?

08:13.733 --> 08:15.855
Nobody touched me, nobody hurt me. I'm fine.

08:15.914 --> 08:16.769
You're fine?

08:17.644 --> 08:18.934
Where did you go?

08:19.098 --> 08:23.450
Don't you ever do that again. Do you have any idea how upset I was?

08:23.532 --> 08:26.829
And Daddy was, and Mrs. Lockhart? And the principal?

08:27.327 --> 08:30.352
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

08:35.107 --> 08:36.322
I don't understand.

08:36.394 --> 08:39.700
You told me that if I ever saw something in my life that reminded me of my dream,

08:39.756 --> 08:41.770
then it's probably a dream that I shouldn't ignore.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.595
That's the dragon. That's him.

08:44.929 --> 08:48.979
I saw him from the bus, and I just knew I was supposed to come back here.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.696
Okay, I know. I got it, okay?

08:51.824 --> 08:54.774
But you know there's a lot of reasons why you could have dreamt about this dragon.

08:54.872 --> 08:56.612
Maybe you passed this advertisement.

08:56.679 --> 08:58.472
Maybe you saw it in a magazine.

08:58.532 --> 09:02.221
Maybe it got stuck in your subconscious, and that's why you dreamt about it.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.434
That can happen, you know.

09:03.503 --> 09:05.309
Okay. Then what about the house?

09:05.372 --> 09:06.355
What house?

09:08.316 --> 09:09.166
See?

09:09.494 --> 09:10.508
She lives here.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.453
Lived here.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.601
I'm confused. I thought you said that you were the girl in the dream trapped in the castle.

09:17.609 --> 09:20.836
It was me, but... it wasn't.

09:22.101 --> 09:24.910
My name in the story was Sara.

09:24.957 --> 09:27.261
And you're telling me that the real Sara lives here?

09:27.340 --> 09:28.336
This is her home?

09:28.968 --> 09:30.647
That's what her brother said.

09:32.228 --> 09:34.030
What else did her brother say?

09:35.381 --> 09:39.831
That she died two years ago, and that I was mean to ask him about her.

09:41.024 --> 09:42.882
Oh, baby.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.292
Mommy,

09:47.557 --> 09:51.571
why am I dreaming about a dead girl that I don't even know?

09:58.626 --> 10:01.586
So am I really grounded for the rest of my life?

10:01.805 --> 10:02.737
I don't know.

10:03.394 --> 10:08.729
So you do understand how ridiculously dangerous it is to trick your teachers and your class and...

10:08.790 --> 10:10.827
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.317
Okay then. All right.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.859
So maybe we'll reduce your sentence by a couple of years or so.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.851
I have to talk to your father first.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.984
So in the meantime, let's get some rest.

10:24.242 --> 10:25.968
I don't want go to sleep.

10:27.416 --> 10:29.449
I'm afraid of what I might dream.

10:29.592 --> 10:30.898
You're in Mommy's bed.

10:31.251 --> 10:33.581
Nothing bad can happen in Mommy's bed.

10:33.703 --> 10:34.574
Hey, honey.

10:34.963 --> 10:36.971
That visitor you were expecting is here.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.296
Is everybody else asleep?

10:38.384 --> 10:40.575
Marie's in her crib and Bridgette's out like a light.

10:41.171 --> 10:41.805
Okay.

10:43.108 --> 10:45.516
You're not going to leave me, are you?

10:45.571 --> 10:46.893
Just for a little while.

10:47.175 --> 10:49.423
Then I'm going to get into bed next to you

10:49.540 --> 10:52.182
and we're going to dream happy dreams together.

10:54.988 --> 10:55.735
Love you.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.394
Love you, too.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.150
You know I normally don't make house calls, but...

11:12.299 --> 11:14.531
Thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate it.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.706
Well, I heard the panic in your voice when you called.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.229
By the way, I asked a friend to join us. I hope you don't mind.

11:21.538 --> 11:23.516
I got a video. You got any popcorn?

11:29.769 --> 11:30.824
Oh, I remember this.

11:31.894 --> 11:33.152
I saw this on the news.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.961
After you called, I ran a check on every "Sara" between the ages of eight and 12

11:44.021 --> 11:48.231
reported missing or murdered within 100 miles of here in the last five years.

11:48.481 --> 11:51.893
Once you subtract the custody-nappings and the false alarms,

11:52.103 --> 11:55.147
the one case you're really left with is Sara Crewson,

11:55.368 --> 11:58.092
a  case Detective Scanlon here helped investigate.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.192
Halloween night, two years ago, Sara Crewson is out

12:00.243 --> 12:02.986
with a group of friends trick or treating, decides to go home early.

12:03.632 --> 12:07.109
A man named, uh, Darrell Yellen, convicted child molester, grabbed her

12:07.146 --> 12:10.400
as she was cutting through a convenience store parking lot two blocks from her house.

12:10.779 --> 12:12.466
The security camera's got the whole thing.

12:12.546 --> 12:14.165
Yeah, I remember this case.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.826
Cops caught him two days later on the run to Mexico.

12:16.893 --> 12:21.102
He  confessed to raping and murdering Sara, along with two other girls.

12:21.444 --> 12:25.361
In exchange for his confession, and for telling the police where to find the bodies,

12:25.530 --> 12:28.056
we took the death penalty off the table.

12:28.572 --> 12:30.855
Yellen's serving a life sentence in Springville.

12:30.934 --> 12:33.882
I know, because I cut the deal.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.471
Do you mind if I ask what's all this about?

12:37.521 --> 12:40.292
Why this sudden fascination with young girls named "Sara"?

12:45.924 --> 12:47.184
No, that's okay.

12:47.404 --> 12:49.344
I just had a dream.

12:49.487 --> 12:51.981
I'm not sure what it means, or if it even means anything at all.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.248
Your dream?

13:01.606 --> 13:03.122
I didn't know what else to say.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.280
Well, for the record, and nobody asked, I hate this.

13:07.356 --> 13:08.278
You hate what?

13:08.569 --> 13:12.907
I hate that when my little girl has a bad dream I can't just give her a hug and a piece of cake.

13:12.978 --> 13:15.339
I have to expect visits from the cops and the D.A.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.829
What did you want me to do?

13:16.911 --> 13:19.168
- I had to see if there was something to it.
- Why?

13:19.379 --> 13:21.765
Because she thinks there's something to it.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.590
Look, all over the world, kids have dreams about the boogeyman,

13:25.636 --> 13:29.220
and all over the world, parents tell them it's going to be okay in the morning.

13:29.306 --> 13:32.041
Well, our kids aren't like other kids. And I know you hate that, too.

13:32.094 --> 13:34.273
I didn't say that. It's just... God.

13:34.359 --> 13:38.476
There's enough death and darkness out there waiting for her when she's an adult.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.300
She's ten, for crying out loud.

13:40.391 --> 13:43.060
It's one night. It's one dream.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.650
It could pass. She's still young.

13:45.818 --> 13:48.743
I give you my word. I'm not putting her in the middle of all this.

13:48.845 --> 13:51.825
As far as everyone is concerned, it's me, it's my dream.

13:51.907 --> 13:55.644
So if we need to get the District Attorney's office and the police involved,

13:55.721 --> 13:58.174
they'll think it's me. Let them deal with me.

13:59.050 --> 14:00.002
Okay?

14:32.856 --> 14:35.627
What are you doing? It's the middle of the night.

14:35.688 --> 14:36.841
Do you want to wake everyone up?

14:41.264 --> 14:44.341
You have the coolest house. If I had this much food in my house,

14:44.428 --> 14:48.617
I would do nothing but eat and watch TV all day and all night.

14:49.984 --> 14:53.132
I want to check out your room. I want to check out your clothes.

14:53.245 --> 14:54.427
Wait, you can't go in there.

14:54.551 --> 14:56.517
My sister's sleeping in there.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.584
I want this, and this and this.

15:05.963 --> 15:08.605
Those are mine. You can't have that. You can't take that.

15:08.692 --> 15:09.860
What gives you the right?

15:10.393 --> 15:12.803
What gives me the right?

15:13.951 --> 15:18.006
I came to you, I asked you for your help,

15:18.308 --> 15:22.255
and you didn't do anything. That's what gives me the right.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.002
You okay, sweetie? Did you have another bad dream?

15:34.694 --> 15:35.771
I don't know.

15:36.331 --> 15:37.650
She's mad, Mommy.

15:37.989 --> 15:39.868
She's mad that I haven't helped her.

15:40.196 --> 15:43.862
Oh, she's not mad at you, sweetie. How could she be?

15:43.949 --> 15:45.101
How do you know?

15:46.847 --> 15:50.415
Well, it has to do with the kind of dream that you're having.

15:52.089 --> 15:56.771
It's really just Sara remembering something that happened when she was alive.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.393
And she's trying to tell you about it, but she's telling you

16:01.315 --> 16:03.323
in a kind of code.

16:03.642 --> 16:04.706
What do you mean?

16:05.085 --> 16:08.849
Like that dragon was really that billboard.

16:09.463 --> 16:12.724
And  the castle is probably just a house somewhere.

16:13.871 --> 16:17.517
And I'm guessing that the monster was really this bad man

16:18.069 --> 16:21.547
that I found out about who took Sara away from her family.

16:21.813 --> 16:23.801
It's okay, sweetie.

16:24.018 --> 16:25.304
He's in prison.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.985
He's locked up where he can never hurt anyone ever again.

16:29.743 --> 16:32.318
Again? What do you mean again?

16:32.421 --> 16:34.500
Well, it's like her brother told you.

16:37.249 --> 16:39.404
Sara has passed on.

16:39.860 --> 16:44.843
And where she is, no one can hurt her. Not any more.

16:44.914 --> 16:48.686
No, I don't think that's right, Mommy.

16:51.005 --> 16:53.223
What do you mean? Why not?

16:53.327 --> 16:56.286
Because I don't think Sara is dead.

16:57.469 --> 16:59.143
I think she's alive.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.466
And she really wants my help.

17:04.503 --> 17:06.511
So there's no question in your mind that it was him?

17:06.583 --> 17:07.984
Allison, he confessed.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.146
What was this dream you had anyway?

17:10.233 --> 17:13.961
It's nothing, I just... I'm worried that this Crewson girl might need our help.

17:14.037 --> 17:17.545
Again, as part of his confession, Darrell Yellen told the police where to find the bodies.

17:17.627 --> 17:20.202
He took us right to them. It was all part of the plea agreement.

17:20.262 --> 17:23.666
Okay, you took him out there, you found her, you...

17:25.066 --> 17:26.940
You did find her, right?

17:27.340 --> 17:29.893
Her clothes? Her bones? Something?

17:30.545 --> 17:34.778
Actually, we found the partial remains of his first two victims, um,

17:35.956 --> 17:37.922
Mindy Atwater and Elizabeth Cale.

17:37.983 --> 17:40.502
But now that you mention it, no.

17:40.558 --> 17:43.078
No physical remains of the Crewson girl were ever discovered.

17:43.144 --> 17:45.474
It was the assumption that an animal probably...

17:45.634 --> 17:47.681
Oh, my God, she might still be alive somewhere?

17:48.265 --> 17:49.135
Hang on.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.964
Let's think about this for a minute.

17:51.532 --> 17:55.008
Why would this man confess to a crime he didn't commit?

17:55.095 --> 17:57.229
I don't know, maybe someone should ask him.

18:09.883 --> 18:12.918
My name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the District Attorney's office.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.977
I need to ask you some questions about Sara Crewson.

18:17.515 --> 18:19.503
Do you remember Sara Crewson?

18:20.655 --> 18:21.551
Of course.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.284
Okay, so take me through it. Um...

18:30.771 --> 18:32.737
you snatched her on Halloween.

18:34.015 --> 18:36.132
And then how long until you killed her?

18:38.473 --> 18:39.584
The next day.

18:41.016 --> 18:45.179
They had that videotape of me in the parking lot on the news.

18:45.255 --> 18:47.569
I knew it was only a matter of time, so...

18:50.469 --> 18:52.050
I took her out to the desert.

18:53.085 --> 18:53.832
And?

18:56.669 --> 18:57.683
I killed her.

19:12.556 --> 19:13.417
That it?

19:15.716 --> 19:16.457
We done?

19:18.474 --> 19:19.370
Anything else?

19:25.786 --> 19:28.162
That's plenty. Thanks.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.492
One night when the ogre wasn't looking, Sara made a break for it.

19:38.423 --> 19:44.014
And just when she was certain she was safe, there he was.

20:00.153 --> 20:03.209
I just don't believe it happened the way he said it did. I just, I don't.

20:04.418 --> 20:06.824
- Why do you think he confessed?
- Because he did it.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.034
Because he wanted to live. He made a deal.

20:10.106 --> 20:13.163
Confessing meant life in prison instead of death by injection.

20:15.303 --> 20:19.203
I'm really struggling with trying to understand what your position is here.

20:19.469 --> 20:23.034
Are you trying to tell me that you think this man confessed to something he didn't do?

20:23.100 --> 20:25.584
I sat with him yesterday. I looked him in the eye.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.902
And I'm here to tell you, Sara Crewson is still alive.

20:28.963 --> 20:30.556
She was abducted over two years ago.

20:30.628 --> 20:33.751
I don't care. He gave her to someone. He made a gift of her.

20:34.057 --> 20:36.178
- She's still out there.
- He told you that?

20:36.249 --> 20:39.122
No. He told me what he told you. He told me he killed her.

20:40.340 --> 20:45.332
Okay, you and I have a history. You tell me that this girl is alive, I'm tempted to believe you.

20:46.505 --> 20:48.496
Where is she? We'll go pick her up.

20:50.335 --> 20:51.173
I don't know.

20:51.369 --> 20:53.836
Then what is it that you'd like me to do?

20:54.036 --> 20:58.199
Assuming what you're saying is true, this little girl could be anywhere in the world.

20:58.593 --> 21:01.388
Darrell Yellen is already in prison for the rest of his life.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.414
How would you have me compel him to tell us where she is...

21:04.501 --> 21:06.099
assuming that he even knows?

21:07.594 --> 21:11.397
Frankly, your theory doesn't make much sense, Allison. Think about it.

21:11.506 --> 21:16.144
Let's say Sara was alive and let's say he actually did give her to someone.

21:16.216 --> 21:18.382
Why didn't he share that with us when he confessed?

21:18.541 --> 21:20.118
I mean, he was trying to make a deal.

21:20.199 --> 21:22.892
Why didn't he use her safe return for a bargaining chip?

21:22.979 --> 21:28.265
Instead  of life without parole, insist on the possibility of parole in 50 years.

21:28.346 --> 21:29.042
Something.

21:29.902 --> 21:31.346
- Or...
- Or?

21:32.467 --> 21:36.999
Or Darrell Yellen chose not to use his trump card because whoever he gave that little girl to

21:37.064 --> 21:40.112
was more important to him than the dim possibility of parole.

21:40.188 --> 21:40.869
Allison...

21:40.972 --> 21:45.657
I mean, think about it, we find this important person, we find Sara.

21:48.089 --> 21:48.897
Excuse me.

21:52.927 --> 21:53.700
Hello?

21:54.975 --> 21:56.552
Yes. This is her mother.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.164
I'll be right there.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.216
I'm sorry.

22:14.389 --> 22:17.924
Don't apologize if you haven't done something to be sorry for.

22:18.726 --> 22:20.462
You want to tell me what happened?

22:21.467 --> 22:23.191
I was in the library,

22:24.078 --> 22:25.706
and I fell asleep.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.260
And I had another dream.

22:34.385 --> 22:36.219
And I woke up screaming.

22:38.993 --> 22:41.623
Why did Sara choose me?

22:42.070 --> 22:44.798
I mean, why is she talking to me?

22:45.495 --> 22:48.618
Maybe because she knew that you would listen.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.269
Hey, what you doing?

22:56.581 --> 22:58.444
You were supposed to come to bed an hour ago.

22:58.684 --> 23:03.308
I know. I just... keep thinking that the answer is in here somewhere.

23:04.766 --> 23:09.595
You know, this crime solving thing is much harder when it isn't you having the dream.

23:10.882 --> 23:12.866
Why is everyone awake?

23:12.990 --> 23:15.170
Sweetie, did you have another bad dream?

23:18.068 --> 23:20.787
Good. I'm glad you're not having those spooky dreams.

23:20.885 --> 23:24.140
I'm not having the dreams because I'm trying to stay awake.

23:24.243 --> 23:27.470
But, honey, that's why you're falling asleep at school.

23:30.987 --> 23:31.913
Mommy?

23:32.368 --> 23:34.719
Why do you have a picture of the ogre?

23:34.858 --> 23:36.055
What are you talking about?

23:37.013 --> 23:39.905
This man? Is he the evil ogre?

24:10.370 --> 24:13.027
Sara, it's Wednesday.

24:20.727 --> 24:21.460
Come on.

24:21.886 --> 24:22.783
I got to go.

24:23.442 --> 24:24.942
Can't I stay out here?

24:26.026 --> 24:28.097
I won't go anywhere, I promise.

24:28.561 --> 24:31.767
You know Darrell's rules. I can't go till you're in there.

24:35.719 --> 24:37.864
Can I take the castle with me?

24:38.760 --> 24:41.991
- Can I play with the castle?
- Sara, stop it!

24:43.014 --> 24:46.404
No. It-It's dark in the closet. You know that.

24:46.728 --> 24:50.348
Now... and no, this is my castle.

25:04.655 --> 25:06.859
Do you want candy?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.623
I'll bring you candy?

25:13.203 --> 25:14.160
Thank you.

25:22.158 --> 25:24.140
Henry Yellen is Darrell Yellen's older brother.

25:24.596 --> 25:26.991
When he was 18 months old, he had a fever, and no one noticed.

25:27.267 --> 25:31.476
Went to his brain, and he's been, I don't know, slow ever since, but he's got no criminal record.

25:31.548 --> 25:34.277
And there is certainly nothing to suggest that he's a pedophile.

25:34.349 --> 25:35.614
How'd he get that scar?

25:35.705 --> 25:38.799
Ah. When they were kids, the father went after Darrell with a knife.

25:38.865 --> 25:41.434
Henry wanted to protect his younger brother and got between them.

25:41.522 --> 25:42.203
God.

25:42.316 --> 25:44.685
Father went to prison, died there two years later.

25:45.126 --> 25:50.001
Darrell's pretty much taken total responsibility for Henry ever since their mother passed away in '98.

25:50.078 --> 25:53.098
So what are you saying? You think that Darrell gave Sara to his brother?

25:53.742 --> 25:56.268
You're the one who said that whoever he gave her to

25:56.325 --> 25:58.741
was even more important than the possibility of parole.

25:59.156 --> 26:01.619
Henry's his blood. Henry saved his life.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.059
And apparently he does need a certain level of care.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.314
Perhaps when Darrell realized he was going to prison for a long, long time,

26:09.371 --> 26:12.139
he made arrangements for someone else to take care of Henry.

26:12.226 --> 26:14.962
So what are we doing here? Why aren't we out looking for this guy?

26:15.033 --> 26:16.840
To start with, we don't know where to find him.

26:16.932 --> 26:19.457
When their mother died, Henry was the sole beneficiary,

26:19.529 --> 26:21.746
and he's lived off the life insurance ever since.

26:21.822 --> 26:23.742
No credit cards. No driver's license.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.842
No property in his name. No taxes filed.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.069
Henry Yellen is untraceable. He could be anywhere.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.186
In fact, the only person we know who's seen him...

26:31.278 --> 26:33.757
is you... in your dreams.

26:34.372 --> 26:37.797
Is there anything you can tell us to begin? A place to start to look?

26:42.430 --> 26:44.633
Actually, it-it's not my dream.

26:46.046 --> 26:46.870
Excuse me?

26:48.580 --> 26:50.304
It's someone else's dream.

26:50.655 --> 26:51.448
What?

26:51.568 --> 26:54.786
Well... then whoever this someone is, let's get them down here.

26:54.837 --> 26:58.036
- Maybe they can shed some light on...
- Oh, no, no. I don't think I can do that.

26:58.446 --> 26:59.234
Allison?

27:02.676 --> 27:04.028
I'll have to get back to you.

27:10.387 --> 27:11.307
Gas 'N Go.

27:12.387 --> 27:13.600
Yeah? I'll accept.

27:14.129 --> 27:15.029
It's your call.

27:20.299 --> 27:21.072
Darrell?

27:21.307 --> 27:21.987
Hey.

27:23.053 --> 27:24.637
You didn't call last week.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.524
Lost my phone privileges.

27:27.119 --> 27:28.798
I waited two hours.

27:29.443 --> 27:31.474
I ate four Slim Jims,

27:32.577 --> 27:36.594
and I, uh, I won $5 on the scratchers cards.

27:36.673 --> 27:37.414
Henry.

27:38.716 --> 27:42.289
You remember the present I gave you, before I went away?

27:43.754 --> 27:45.458
Yeah, I love my present.

27:46.251 --> 27:48.310
Yeah, well, you got to get rid of it.

27:54.503 --> 27:57.588
Uh, Darrell, uh, no. I...

27:57.649 --> 28:00.758
What did I say when I gave it to you? What did I say, Henry?!

28:01.017 --> 28:03.768
I said you might have to throw it away sometime, didn't I?

28:04.337 --> 28:06.364
You promised me you'd do what I said.

28:06.890 --> 28:08.581
I thought you kept your promises.

28:09.174 --> 28:11.715
I do keep my promises, but...

28:13.378 --> 28:14.238
Why?

28:14.975 --> 28:17.050
People are asking questions about it.

28:17.427 --> 28:19.895
Bad people. And they're gonna come looking for it.

28:21.262 --> 28:23.653
They can't come and take my present.

28:23.757 --> 28:24.797
Sure they can.

28:25.257 --> 28:28.579
They'll take the present away, and then they'll take you away.

28:29.111 --> 28:30.443
And we don't want that.

28:31.193 --> 28:32.542
So you got to get rid of it.

28:34.176 --> 28:35.066
Darrell...

28:37.499 --> 28:40.351
I'm gonna be all by myself again.

28:40.448 --> 28:42.880
I don't know what to tell you, Henry. You want to go to jail?

28:43.724 --> 28:45.910
You'll have more company than you can stand.

28:52.727 --> 28:54.989
Does it have to be today?

28:55.096 --> 28:58.475
'Cause I promised her candy already.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.435
Doesn't have to be today.

29:02.669 --> 29:03.933
You could do it tomorrow.

29:04.793 --> 29:06.258
But you have to do it.

29:06.895 --> 29:09.049
Yeah, I'll do it tomorrow.

29:10.128 --> 29:11.610
I'll keep my promise.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.589
So, it's the woods. So that must mean something rural.

29:32.114 --> 29:33.399
And there's a castle?

29:34.634 --> 29:37.715
It's... like a toy castle.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.373
It's a dream, so...

29:41.829 --> 29:45.237
Well, I don't know that there are many toy castles in rural Arizona.

29:45.672 --> 29:47.961
Maybe it's an amusement park or a miniature golf course.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.881
We'll check.

29:51.426 --> 29:52.890
We know who the ogre is.

29:53.628 --> 29:55.615
The blue and white house is where Sara lived.

29:57.808 --> 29:59.373
Is there anything else?

30:00.092 --> 30:02.190
No, I don't think so.

30:03.154 --> 30:06.710
You really think all this stuff is going to save Sara?

30:07.330 --> 30:08.286
We hope so.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.597
Well, I've got my homework.

30:12.472 --> 30:15.000
Very nice meeting you, Ariel. I know it's way past your bedtime.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.505
I appreciate you staying up for me.

30:16.571 --> 30:18.952
Uh, don't worry, I'll let myself out. I'll see you tomorrow.

30:19.392 --> 30:20.054
Okay.

30:24.252 --> 30:26.105
- Night, Mommy.
- Night, baby.

30:31.594 --> 30:33.253
Is Daddy okay?

30:34.635 --> 30:36.633
Why is he sitting outside alone?

30:38.235 --> 30:39.750
He's disappointed.

30:40.231 --> 30:44.800
I made him a promise, and I couldn't keep it, and I feel very badly about it.

30:46.712 --> 30:50.047
But he'll forgive you eventually, won't he?

30:51.347 --> 30:52.764
He always does.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.190
This thing you did tonight?

30:56.856 --> 30:59.914
I am very proud of you for trying to help this girl.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.642
But I also want you to know...

31:03.046 --> 31:07.106
having special dreams... knowing things that people are thinking...

31:08.044 --> 31:11.176
Sometimes when people grow up, that goes away,

31:11.494 --> 31:14.209
and that's okay, too, okay?

31:14.817 --> 31:16.671
- Okay.
- Love you.

31:16.922 --> 31:18.780
- Good night, Mom.
- I love you.

31:28.919 --> 31:29.798
He just left.

31:35.384 --> 31:36.701
She was wonderful.

31:38.661 --> 31:41.239
I think it's going to be fine. I really do.

31:42.788 --> 31:47.385
And I believe it could still all go away-- the dreams, the prescience.

31:48.750 --> 31:51.124
I mean, what choice did we have?

31:51.217 --> 31:53.546
A little girl's life might be at stake.

31:53.664 --> 31:54.779
I know you're right.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.735
I know we had no choice.

31:57.719 --> 32:00.985
It's just that two days ago, she didn't know there really were monsters...

32:02.610 --> 32:05.736
grown men who snatch little girls and keep 'em...

32:07.713 --> 32:08.731
or kill 'em.

32:10.425 --> 32:11.557
And now she does,

32:12.771 --> 32:14.005
and I hate that.

32:18.193 --> 32:19.781
Go on; I'll be in in a minute.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.987
Every morning young Sara would awaken

32:35.049 --> 32:38.561
and set about cooking and cleaning and taking care of the whole castle.

32:38.715 --> 32:41.566
And every night, she'd sit by the castle window

32:41.693 --> 32:44.136
and secretly dream of someday

32:44.710 --> 32:46.000
finding a gun

32:46.754 --> 32:49.236
and blowing her captor's brains out.

32:55.514 --> 32:57.889
Springville? Why Springville?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.599
Your daughter said woods. Woods means rural,

32:59.650 --> 33:02.709
so as a matter of course, I got the prison to check Darrell's phone records.

33:02.794 --> 33:04.664
Who's he calling? Where do they live?

33:05.686 --> 33:09.352
Pretty much every week, Darrell uses his phone privilege to call this number in Springville.

33:09.424 --> 33:10.214
You're kidding.

33:10.409 --> 33:12.963
Wouldn't happen to be the home phone at some castle, would it?

33:14.908 --> 33:16.164
No such luck.

33:33.238 --> 33:34.082
Good morning.

33:34.784 --> 33:37.550
I'm Detective Scanlon with the Phoenix Police Department.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.265
Okay.

33:38.327 --> 33:40.262
I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?

33:40.627 --> 33:41.390
Okay.

33:42.312 --> 33:45.066
You behind this counter most Wednesdays between 3:00 and 4:00?

33:46.191 --> 33:49.249
We're investigating a series of telephone calls that you've been receiving

33:49.295 --> 33:52.689
on a fairly regular basis from Springville State Penitentiary.

33:53.636 --> 33:54.906
Are the calls for you?

34:00.279 --> 34:01.055
Sir?

34:02.354 --> 34:04.434
The calls come here, but they aren't for me.

34:04.721 --> 34:08.652
This fellow Henry comes in every Wednesday, waits for his brother to call.

34:08.735 --> 34:10.081
I accept the charges.

34:10.277 --> 34:12.612
Then he pays me cash for the calls at the end of month.

34:12.678 --> 34:13.768
Henry Yellen.

34:14.737 --> 34:16.123
I don't know his last name.

34:16.697 --> 34:17.797
He's got a...

34:18.397 --> 34:19.349
That's our guy.

34:21.985 --> 34:23.665
Has he ever come in here with anyone else?

34:24.351 --> 34:25.525
A little girl, maybe?

34:25.612 --> 34:27.547
No, never seen a girl. Just Henry.

34:27.685 --> 34:29.513
You wouldn't happen to know where he lives, would you?

34:29.594 --> 34:31.591
No. I'm sorry.

34:31.841 --> 34:34.663
He doesn't have an account here? You never delivered groceries to his place or anything?

34:35.036 --> 34:35.717
No.

34:36.649 --> 34:39.516
What if I get a warrant, search your records? Would that change anything?

34:45.886 --> 34:48.001
Incredible what a memory jogger a warrant is, huh?

34:53.900 --> 34:54.627
What?

34:55.168 --> 34:56.071
Castle Road.

35:15.302 --> 35:16.402
Someone's coming.

35:16.818 --> 35:18.767
Oh, my gosh, someone's coming!

35:19.874 --> 35:20.928
It's not a castle.

35:22.095 --> 35:23.974
Well, it's the only house on the road.

35:27.948 --> 35:29.765
Don't let 'em see you! Get away!

35:33.814 --> 35:35.741
Coming to take my present.

35:38.912 --> 35:40.210
Get in the closet.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.383
No...

35:42.689 --> 35:45.746
I don't want to lose my present. Now get in the closet.

35:45.817 --> 35:47.502
Please don't make me.

35:49.376 --> 35:51.782
Mr. Yellen, I'm with the Phoenix Police.

35:52.038 --> 35:54.095
If you're in there, you want to open up, please?

36:02.298 --> 36:05.463
Good morning, Officer. I'll be right down.

36:13.241 --> 36:15.775
Come on, hurry up and get in the closet.

36:30.268 --> 36:32.174
Mr. Yellen, we haven't got all day!

36:32.635 --> 36:34.922
Sara! Shh!

36:35.957 --> 36:37.208
They're going to hear you.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.630
Then let me out!

36:40.232 --> 36:43.454
I'll be quiet! Just let me out!

36:43.706 --> 36:44.620
Mr. Yellen?

36:52.270 --> 36:53.100
Mr. Yellen?

36:53.437 --> 36:55.259
You promise not to make a sound?

36:57.174 --> 36:58.219
I promise.

37:03.073 --> 37:04.717
I love my present.

37:06.227 --> 37:08.097
I don't want to hurt my present.

37:11.343 --> 37:12.340
No sound.

37:13.744 --> 37:14.772
No sound!

37:15.848 --> 37:17.020
No noise.

37:18.536 --> 37:19.467
Mr. Yellen?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.206
I'm coming!

37:24.214 --> 37:26.349
Here I... here I come!

37:33.371 --> 37:34.665
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.641
Ariel?

37:35.821 --> 37:38.181
I woke up this morning, and you had already left.

37:38.300 --> 37:40.993
I had to come out to the country with Detective Scanlon. What is it, baby?

37:41.048 --> 37:42.559
I just... I had another dream.

37:43.835 --> 37:44.929
Hello, Officer.

37:45.963 --> 37:49.775
Took me a minute to, uh, tie my shoes.

37:49.845 --> 37:51.826
- You Henry Yellen?
- Yeah, that's right.

37:52.662 --> 37:54.505
Honey, I didn't get that.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.900
What-what did you say about your dream?

37:57.003 --> 37:59.000
I said, "I had another dream".

38:03.766 --> 38:06.624
We're investigating the disappearance of a little girl named Sara Crewson.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.229
It was another dream where I was Sara.

38:09.404 --> 38:11.063
Do you have a problem if we look around your house?

38:14.355 --> 38:15.946
Ariel, this is important.

38:16.151 --> 38:18.896
- Tell me, what happened?
- I don't see how I could do that, be...

38:19.065 --> 38:24.425
Uh, I mean, this is my house, and, uh, I don't think I have to let you in my house.

38:24.497 --> 38:28.701
Well, I was sitting in the Castle again, and you were telling the story...

38:32.561 --> 38:36.780
I can go to my car, call the local courthouse and get a piece of paper that'll make you let me in your house.

38:37.410 --> 38:40.010
- Only this time...
- Going to make me do that, Henry?

38:41.010 --> 38:43.892
That's not true. Uh, this is my house,

38:43.963 --> 38:46.411
- and you can't just come in here.
- What? Damn! I can't hear!

38:46.463 --> 38:48.486
You can't just come and take my present.

38:48.557 --> 38:50.451
Mr. Yellen, I don't think you're understanding me.

38:50.538 --> 38:54.428
I'm going in there-- it's a matter of whether you're going to be smiling or frowning when I do.

38:58.833 --> 39:01.714
Okay, Henry, I'm going back to my car. I'm going to call the judge.

39:07.005 --> 39:10.240
I had a gun, and I shot him.

39:10.332 --> 39:11.054
A gun?!

39:14.070 --> 39:14.894
Mom?!

39:16.758 --> 39:17.597
Mom?

39:18.751 --> 39:19.544
Sara!

39:20.827 --> 39:22.190
Put that gun down!

39:22.256 --> 39:22.984
Mom?

39:23.102 --> 39:25.498
Can you come down here?! Are you locked up there?!

39:25.580 --> 39:26.644
I'm coming to get you!

39:27.356 --> 39:29.993
- Ariel, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- We need an ambulance at Castle Road in Springville.

39:30.209 --> 39:33.337
You did it! We got her! She's okay!

39:36.905 --> 39:37.780
Mom?

39:37.927 --> 39:39.031
My present.

39:39.808 --> 39:42.169
You'll take away my present.

39:42.353 --> 39:43.951
She's not a present.

39:47.723 --> 39:49.158
I'm okay, I'm okay.

39:49.947 --> 39:52.265
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, baby, bye.

39:56.404 --> 40:00.120
Here, sweetie. It's okay, it's okay. It's going to be okay.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.831
It's okay. It's okay. It's going to be okay.

40:10.071 --> 40:11.183
Mom?

40:12.670 --> 40:13.554
Mom?

40:15.849 --> 40:18.213
Slept through the night in my own room.

40:18.634 --> 40:19.723
No dreams?

40:21.070 --> 40:22.141
Just one.

40:24.035 --> 40:26.119
Nothing much happened in it, though.

40:26.421 --> 40:30.655
It was just about how I lived here with you and Daddy

40:30.809 --> 40:34.382
and Bridgette and Marie and we all lived happily ever after.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.178
Wow, that sounds like a fairy tale.

40:37.895 --> 40:39.796
You still believe in fairy tales?

40:42.831 --> 40:45.601
Good. I'll tell Daddy. It'll make him very happy.

40:46.154 --> 40:50.060
Fee, fi, fo, fum...

40:50.506 --> 40:54.162
I smell the blood of a Dubois young'un.

40:54.275 --> 40:55.650
What's going on here?!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
