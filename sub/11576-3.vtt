WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:10.458
Ahhhhh!

00:10.678 --> 00:11.633
What is this place?

00:11.846 --> 00:12.335
Grrr--

00:12.555 --> 00:13.305
What's wrong with me?!

00:13.514 --> 00:14.594
Hey, hey, hey, here--

00:14.807 --> 00:16.798
It's just a little bit
of transcendental sickness.

00:17.018 --> 00:17.973
Look...

00:18.686 --> 00:19.766
Okay...

00:25.318 --> 00:25.773
Argh!

00:25.985 --> 00:26.610
Stop!

00:28.988 --> 00:29.773
Sorry.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.199
What the hell was that?

00:32.408 --> 00:34.023
| just saved your life!

00:34.493 --> 00:36.779
Non-Elemental boys
like yourself can't pass

00:36.996 --> 00:39.112
from one plane to the
next without getting sick.

00:39.332 --> 00:41.948
Next stop same as the last!

00:42.168 --> 00:44.159
Last stop same before next!

00:44.378 --> 00:46.790
Get your tickets ready please!

00:48.841 --> 00:49.500
Hey!

00:51.677 --> 00:52.462
Hey!

00:53.471 --> 00:54.051
We're looking for a woman.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.218
Her name is Bo.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.967
(train shaking)

00:57.183 --> 00:58.172
Whoa!

01:00.019 --> 01:01.975
Nothing to worry about, folks!

01:02.188 --> 01:07.433
The engineer must have
forgotten his glasses!

01:11.155 --> 01:12.065
Hey!

01:15.826 --> 01:18.112
Is it me or did this
entire train just shake

01:18.329 --> 01:19.785
at the mention of Bo's name?

01:20.331 --> 01:25.291
(grinding metal)

01:25.503 --> 01:26.117
Woah--

01:29.507 --> 01:30.622
The screams...

01:31.634 --> 01:34.046
Damned souls are trapped
and they're trying to get out.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.298
We gotta get out of
here and find your girl.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.300
Come on.

02:11.173 --> 02:17.635
(heavy breathing)

02:21.600 --> 02:23.136
Would you please
stop with the attitude?

02:23.352 --> 02:24.137
I hate this place.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.433
There's no WlFl or anything,

02:25.646 --> 02:26.431
and it's a shit-hole!

02:26.647 --> 02:28.353
lt'sjust gonna
be for one night.

02:28.983 --> 02:29.438
(crash)

02:29.650 --> 02:30.355
Ahhhh!

02:35.823 --> 02:36.858
Stay here.

02:50.004 --> 02:50.834
Home?

02:54.633 --> 02:55.292
(clang)

02:55.509 --> 02:56.134
(thud)

02:58.679 --> 02:59.509
What?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.717
Someone had to do something.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.310
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.063
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.940
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:14.820 --> 03:19.610
I was lost for years...
Searching, while hiding.

03:19.825 --> 03:23.113
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.452
I won 't hide anymore.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.121
I will live the life I choose.

03:35.508 --> 03:39.467
(humming)

03:39.678 --> 03:40.804
Lefty loosey.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.219
Rig hty tig hty.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.844
Seen your mother in her nighty.

03:47.937 --> 03:50.428
Oh, there's the
little trouble maker.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.824
Can I help you, young lady?

04:02.660 --> 04:04.241
You miss the
piano that you left

04:04.453 --> 04:06.409
back in Poland, don't you?

04:07.665 --> 04:08.620
Pity.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.955
I could have made you a star.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.202
Ow!

04:29.603 --> 04:30.809
Holy crap!

04:31.397 --> 04:32.432
What did you do?

04:32.648 --> 04:34.104
A little reorganizing.

04:34.859 --> 04:35.598
Is it okay?

04:35.818 --> 04:37.058
Okay?

04:37.278 --> 04:39.610
This place is more organized
than my shitty apartment.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.441
Um...

04:41.657 --> 04:43.238
Sugar is with salt and pepper.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.281
Obviously.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.115
And, um, vinegar is with
Ketchup and other condiments.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.458
Oh! And no longer directly
next to the baking soda,

04:51.667 --> 04:54.283
you can imagine my
surprise when I saw that,

04:54.503 --> 04:56.459
actually everybody's
surprised if those two decide

04:56.672 --> 04:58.628
to mix it up
and have a partay.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.962
Carbonic acid is
actually very unstable,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.464
kind of like this place,

05:04.680 --> 05:05.965
and Ronald.

05:07.016 --> 05:07.801
You're hilarious.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.132
Am I?

05:10.352 --> 05:11.307
So?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.475
You like?

05:12.688 --> 05:13.643
Yeah.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.562
I do like.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.774
| just need some sugar.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.120
Crystal--

05:32.333 --> 05:33.288
I can't.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.126
(bell dinging)

05:38.339 --> 05:40.330
Break's over!
Break's over!

05:40.549 --> 05:41.299
See?

05:42.343 --> 05:43.628
Unstable.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.126
See.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.301
Funny.

06:08.827 --> 06:09.953
Were you on the train?

06:10.162 --> 06:11.117
What train?

06:11.330 --> 06:12.160
Mom--

06:12.373 --> 06:13.783
"Train" is obvi
slang for heroin.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.614
I mean, just look at her.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.617
Hi, my name is Kathy.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.546
And this is my...
energetic daughter, Julia.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.797
BO: Why is he
walking like that?

06:32.017 --> 06:35.259
Oh, it's an old Jenkins
family superstition.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.514
Makes for a fun weekend.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.470
Where did all the smoke go?

06:38.691 --> 06:39.931
Somebody broke
all those glasses.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.936
Bitch, I think
your brain broke.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.107
Julia!

06:43.320 --> 06:45.060
Does this have something
to do with Lauren?

06:45.281 --> 06:45.895
Oh, god--

06:46.115 --> 06:47.605
Why can't I remember, |--

06:48.826 --> 06:49.781
Ow!

06:51.328 --> 06:52.613
Did somebody hit me?

06:52.830 --> 06:53.785
Mom did.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.453
Oh, god--

06:57.001 --> 06:58.286
Oh, god, I am so hungry.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.787
Would you like
something to eat?

07:00.004 --> 07:01.790
Oh, please do not ask me that.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.127
WOMAN'S VOICE: Kill them...

07:03.340 --> 07:04.090
Kill them all...

07:04.300 --> 07:05.335
Kill them.

07:05.551 --> 07:06.165
Oh...

07:06.385 --> 07:08.000
Keep it together, Dennis.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.134
Okay.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.256
Shoes are all hung.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.131
lan!

07:11.348 --> 07:12.463
Our guest is awake.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.267
Uh, can you
not look at my dad

07:21.483 --> 07:23.690
like he's made
out of hotdogs?

07:23.902 --> 07:24.766
Young lady--

07:24.987 --> 07:26.352
It's okay.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.608
She reminds me
of my best friend.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.277
lt's comforting.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.777
Look, I don't mean to be
rude, but you need to go--

07:34.997 --> 07:35.452
Dad.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.950
She's practically
a dead person. Jesus.

07:38.167 --> 07:39.156
She needs to go.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.081
Now.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.124
Ian, she hasn't had anything--

07:41.337 --> 07:41.746
Girls!

07:46.842 --> 07:48.127
Now!

07:53.515 --> 07:55.301
Can I use the
ladies room first?

07:59.730 --> 08:01.061
This was her room.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.013
She was here.

08:09.156 --> 08:09.781
Hey!

08:09.990 --> 08:10.945
Wake up!

08:11.992 --> 08:13.607
The girl that
did this to you--

08:13.827 --> 08:16.284
She's such a good kisser...

08:17.498 --> 08:18.783
Where is she?!

08:18.999 --> 08:19.954
Where's Bo?!

08:20.501 --> 08:24.289
(screeching)

08:24.672 --> 08:28.881
He's gonna be so angry
when he finds out she's gone.

08:32.346 --> 08:32.960
Bo!

08:44.817 --> 08:46.057
This was hers.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.443
If she jumped from
the sickness that you had

08:49.655 --> 08:51.941
a minute ago, it's just
the tip of the iceberg.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.864
The delirium and the stomach
cramps are gonna lead to death.

08:55.077 --> 08:55.987
But I'm fine!

08:56.203 --> 08:57.943
Because you're
with me, an Elemental.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.699
And this train is special.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.284
If you leave or enter
without an invitation,

09:02.501 --> 09:03.616
or at least an anchor.

09:03.836 --> 09:04.700
But you could save her, right?

09:04.920 --> 09:05.955
I don't know.

09:06.171 --> 09:06.751
Maybe.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.295
You can do this, come on.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.222
Fasten your
seat belt, Lover Boy.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.859
(door creak)

10:18.285 --> 10:19.650
(click)

10:22.998 --> 10:25.034
What the hell are
you doing down here?

10:25.834 --> 10:27.620
Not so much
father of the year,

10:27.836 --> 10:28.951
are we, Ian?

10:32.841 --> 10:35.127
You think you can just hold
people against their will?

10:35.344 --> 10:36.254
Huh?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.461
You're keeping
your daughter prisoner?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.216
You don't know
anything about me.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.592
We are protecting Julia.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.095
I don't need
you to protect me.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.426
Protect her from what?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.011
A stupid ghost!

10:48.315 --> 10:49.270
Come again?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.101
My family's haunted.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.775
Every year on this
exact day it comes for us.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.447
That's why we come out here.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.695
We get away from neighbors,

11:00.911 --> 11:02.276
we get away from families.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.112
We lock ourselves in
these cells until morning.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.948
Until it's gone.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.037
Why is a ghost
haunting your family?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.459
I don't know.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.627
| just inherited
the damn thing.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.378
Everyone in my family died
before they could tell me why.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.468
Well, you know
dealing with "weird shit"

11:19.680 --> 11:20.965
is kinda what I do.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.471
I can help.

11:23.809 --> 11:26.596
O-M-G, help what?

11:26.812 --> 11:30.100
There is no frigging
ghost, you psychos!

11:30.566 --> 11:32.852
Every year you lock me
up in this stupid house,

11:33.068 --> 11:35.104
and l have never
even once seen a ghost!

11:35.320 --> 11:36.776
You can't keep
jailing me away!

11:37.322 --> 11:38.277
All right, it's time.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.650
Dad! No!

11:40.492 --> 11:42.778
And it's time for
you to leave my house.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.327
If I'm locked up,
then she's locked up too.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.905
You both can't be
in the same cell, Julia.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.080
You know that!

11:49.293 --> 11:51.705
Ian, what if she goes outside
past the shoes and the knots?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.707
I am not risking
my daughter's life!

11:55.173 --> 11:57.789
And you need to leave now.

11:58.010 --> 11:58.294
Dad!

11:58.510 --> 11:59.465
It's okay.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.503
I'll go.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.176
Thank you for everything.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.938
ln. ln.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.413
No phone calls, no letters.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.966
No correspondence of any kind.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.793
For five long years.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.595
And now all of a sudden,
you can't live without me.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.933
What can I say?

12:47.142 --> 12:48.097
I'm touched.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.016
If there's one thing
that life has taught me,

12:52.731 --> 12:53.516
But, I agree.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.767
You are touched.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.850
Now, there is something
different about you.

12:58.070 --> 12:58.775
Evony.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.022
Did you dye your hair?

13:00.238 --> 13:01.444
Yes.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.272
Thank you for noticing.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.783
The color is called
Grow-My-Eyeball-Back-

13:06.995 --> 13:09.907
Or-You-Will-Be-Growing-
Back-A-Ball-of-Your-Own.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.117
That's catchy.

13:11.333 --> 13:11.913
Isn't it just?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.160
Yeah.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.493
You sing Soprano in your
church choir don't you?

13:17.673 --> 13:18.412
Alto.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.293
Oh.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.131
My child...

13:26.848 --> 13:28.930
| see you still have
a way with children.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.599
Hazard of the
profession, I suppose.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.428
When you've been in
power as long as l have,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.058
everyone is your child.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.599
Like it or not,

13:38.819 --> 13:41.811
one day you just wake
up and you're a mother.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.940
And Druid.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.027
Don't disappoint me like
"Chanel Number Goo" did.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.704
My eyes are brown.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.622
Actually, they're
imperial brown

13:54.835 --> 13:56.291
with a slight flare of green

13:56.503 --> 13:57.959
in the rim of the cornea.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.213
Just don't screw this up.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.933
Dad? Dad, I'm sorry--

14:14.146 --> 14:14.601
Hey.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.928
You came back.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.392
You need a cell mate?

14:19.818 --> 14:20.603
Ugh.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.020
Ugh.

14:22.237 --> 14:22.771
Are you okay?

14:22.988 --> 14:23.773
Ugh.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.776
You kind of look like
that girl from that video

14:27.993 --> 14:29.449
in health class
giving gross birth.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.197
It's fine, Kenz, really.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.706
Uh, who's Kenz?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.207
Somebody I obviously
miss very much.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.128
Look, um, Julia...

14:42.340 --> 14:43.671
What is going on?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.799
I've been to my share
of bad family reunions,

14:47.012 --> 14:49.469
believe me, but
this is crazy town.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.134
Um, can I show you something?

14:52.350 --> 14:53.100
WOMAN'S VOICE: Kill them...

14:53.310 --> 14:54.425
Kill them all.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.929
Kill them...

14:59.316 --> 15:01.147
People in my family, keep--

15:01.359 --> 15:02.485
They keep dying.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.776
Murder.

15:04.988 --> 15:05.943
Suicide.

15:07.491 --> 15:10.198
My great grandfather he poisoned
his whole family, almost,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.116
and then...

15:12.329 --> 15:14.786
posed them like dolls
that are at a tea party.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.038
Um, and then there's--

15:18.502 --> 15:19.491
There's this.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.622
That little boy, right there?

15:21.838 --> 15:22.918
That's my dad.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.498
He saw his father
shoot his entire family.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.797
You know how he talked
about inheriting this ghost?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.470
What if what he actually
inherited is this thing?

15:32.682 --> 15:34.013
This...

15:34.226 --> 15:36.808
...thing that keeps making
them do all this horrible stuff.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.098
You've never seen anything
out of the ordinary?

15:39.314 --> 15:41.430
He locks me in a box, okay?

15:41.650 --> 15:43.481
He's sick.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.111
I'm just scared that
one day he's gonna hurt us.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.950
Well, I guess
there's nothing I can do.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.451
Except get you out of here.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.963
Oh, thank you.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.460
Thank you for listening to me.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.213
You know, for a
totally loco chick

16:10.428 --> 16:11.634
breaking in
our house, you're--

16:11.847 --> 16:13.132
you're actually pretty cool.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.304
Come on.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.147
We've lost her scent.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.569
No, no, relax.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.317
I know these woods.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.491
My friend Lazy John
was buried out here.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.787
He fell asleep
against a tree and then...

16:39.833 --> 16:41.289
Monkeys buried him.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.790
Monkeys?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.792
John”.

16:49.009 --> 16:49.714
John!

16:52.846 --> 16:53.631
John”.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.132
Uh huh...

16:56.099 --> 16:57.214
Hi, John.

16:58.185 --> 16:58.765
Hello.

16:58.977 --> 16:59.341
Hi.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.926
Hi, Clio.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.098
John”.

17:03.315 --> 17:06.273
I would like you to
meet my business associate.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.269
John.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.442
Business Associate.

17:09.654 --> 17:13.442
Have you seen a succubus
running through these woods?

17:13.658 --> 17:16.616
Your Succubus ran
through last night.

17:17.495 --> 17:18.280
But--

17:18.997 --> 17:21.033
What direction did she go?

17:21.416 --> 17:22.041
Hm.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.789
Okay.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.711
Don't judge me.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.218
You can lick one toe.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.298
No!

17:37.515 --> 17:38.300
Him.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.760
Come again?

17:39.976 --> 17:42.092
Do you want to find
your Succubus or not?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.177
Business associate.

17:47.150 --> 17:47.935
Man!

17:48.151 --> 17:49.937
You must really love this girl.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.064
We shall never
speak of this again.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.947
So what's the real story
with this voodoo juju?

18:00.163 --> 18:01.699
Apparently the stupid
ghost can't come inside

18:01.915 --> 18:03.451
'til she tries
on all the shoes

18:03.667 --> 18:04.952
and unties all
the knots. Lame!

18:05.168 --> 18:05.998
And walking backwards?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.792
Oh, a ghost can't
jump inside your body

18:08.004 --> 18:09.869
if you're walking
backwards, I mean, duh.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.296
'Cause that makes sense.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.630
That's not a ghost.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.797
That's a body jumper!

18:14.010 --> 18:14.965
BO: Julia!

18:15.512 --> 18:16.547
Julia, no!

18:29.442 --> 18:30.773
You see--

18:30.986 --> 18:32.772
I told you not to interfere!

18:32.988 --> 18:33.647
Look, I'm sorry.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.114
l was just trying to help.

18:35.323 --> 18:35.857
Help?!

18:36.074 --> 18:36.984
I had this under control!

18:37.200 --> 18:37.985
lan!

18:44.165 --> 18:45.621
Where did Julia collapse?

18:45.834 --> 18:46.573
Outside.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.782
(gaSP)

18:48.003 --> 18:49.539
Past the shoes and knots.

18:58.972 --> 18:59.586
(gun cocking)

19:00.515 --> 19:02.096
Ian, what are you doing?!

19:02.309 --> 19:04.015
We said if this
thing entered one of us,

19:04.227 --> 19:05.467
we would kill
whoever that was!

19:05.687 --> 19:06.437
But not Julia!

19:06.646 --> 19:09.979
I will not let her live...

19:10.191 --> 19:11.772
with what I had to live with.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.270
Ian! Please!

19:13.486 --> 19:14.646
She's our baby!

19:14.863 --> 19:17.149
I know what happened to
you when you were young,

19:17.365 --> 19:19.071
but there is
always another way.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.616
You don't know anything!

19:21.828 --> 19:26.788
You don't know what this
thing did to my family.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.366
To my... to my brother,
to my... my sister,

19:29.586 --> 19:31.497
my mother, my father!

19:33.423 --> 19:36.085
What it made me do.

19:37.010 --> 19:37.965
You?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.761
You told me that
was your father!

19:43.391 --> 19:46.883
|f Julia ever had
to do what I did...

19:49.522 --> 19:50.978
You don't know
what it's like

19:51.191 --> 19:53.352
to have something
inside of you!

19:53.568 --> 19:56.230
To have something
you just can't control.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.812
Actually, yeah, I do.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.317
I can fix this.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.273
Fix it?

20:03.661 --> 20:06.494
I can still hear
that thing laughing...

20:09.250 --> 20:12.413
while I butchered
everybody that I loved.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.714
You can't fix pure evil.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.885
(lights bursting)

20:27.060 --> 20:28.516
(posessed) He's right.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.934
(possessed) I am pure evil.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.558
(possessed) And I
ain't never felt better.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.484
(neck cracking)

20:37.695 --> 20:38.559
Go! Hide!

20:38.780 --> 20:39.405
I won't let anything happen!

20:39.614 --> 20:40.273
Not without our daughter!

20:40.490 --> 20:41.525
I've got this.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.027
Come on, let's go!

20:59.217 --> 21:00.673
Tips.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.083
Thanks.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.918
Mmhmm.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.342
| just have a lot on my mind.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.393
It's okay.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.721
Really, I... | get it.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.605
Why are you here?

21:19.821 --> 21:21.686
Uh... | work here?

21:21.906 --> 21:23.316
Yeah, I know.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.114
It's just that--

21:26.870 --> 21:29.077
I know why Ronald is here.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.952
And I'm still kinda
working on why I'm here--

21:33.168 --> 21:36.001
Oh, that "why are you here."

21:36.212 --> 21:36.792
You know what,

21:37.005 --> 21:38.461
if it's too
personal a question...

21:39.591 --> 21:41.047
It's okay.

21:42.010 --> 21:42.999
Um...

21:44.304 --> 21:46.420
Well, I guess...

21:50.393 --> 21:54.682
she can... start to feel
like she's the one causing it.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.889
She is bad luck.

21:58.568 --> 22:02.186
And that's when you
start to accept things.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.770
Like how being
the best singer in town

22:03.990 --> 22:07.482
doesn't really mean
very much in the big city.

22:07.702 --> 22:13.197
And how sometimes big
dreams will swallow you whole.

22:14.542 --> 22:19.081
If you don't turn 'em
into small ones instead.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.212
Small ones like this.

22:27.013 --> 22:27.877
Farm for sale?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.349
Small farm for sale.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.469
Just under ten acres.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.641
Couple of chickens. Pigs.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.140
An old Palomino named Duke.

22:37.982 --> 22:41.850
Work hard all day and just sit
and watch the stars at night.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.894
Little heaven right there.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.071
See you tomorrow.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.402
Mmhmm.

22:52.914 --> 22:56.122
Listen, I know
you're not on the market

22:56.334 --> 22:59.701
but if you ever wanna
grab some beer and...

22:59.921 --> 23:01.707
a pizza and vent...

23:02.590 --> 23:04.455
you know where | live.

23:04.676 --> 23:07.338
l have no idea
where you live.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.109
Ugh!

23:23.194 --> 23:24.695
(possessed)
What the hell are you?

23:25.154 --> 23:26.280
Awesome on two legs.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.275
And what type of
Fae might you be?

23:28.491 --> 23:29.947
(possessed) Jumbee,
Jumbee, Jumbee, Jumbee...

23:30.159 --> 23:31.945
Oh, I don't want
to hurt you Julia,

23:32.161 --> 23:33.947
but this bitch
ain't making it easy.

23:37.834 --> 23:38.698
Ahhhh!

23:38.918 --> 23:39.953
Who the hell are you?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.375
Dyson!

23:42.463 --> 23:43.293
His name is Dyson.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.712
It's okay.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.920
Oh, god.
How did you find me?

23:52.140 --> 23:54.131
I had a little help.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.933
(possessed) Jumbee,
Jumbee, Jumbee, Jumbee...

23:59.689 --> 24:01.429
Bo, meet Clio.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.980
(knocking)

24:10.658 --> 24:11.408
(knocking)

24:15.663 --> 24:19.781
The beer and the
pizza and the venting.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.286
|s right now too soon?

24:22.003 --> 24:23.288
Of course not.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.290
Come on in.

24:32.889 --> 24:33.503
Ugh!

24:33.723 --> 24:34.508
We know you can body-jump,

24:34.724 --> 24:36.009
but what else you got?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.681
Huh...

24:37.894 --> 24:40.055
Did ljust
agree to a threesome?

24:46.444 --> 24:47.854
Mama!

24:48.071 --> 24:49.777
Mama, they're hurting me!

24:49.989 --> 24:50.444
Baby!

24:50.657 --> 24:52.022
Mom!

24:54.077 --> 24:55.032
Kathy, no!

24:55.328 --> 24:56.443
(choking)

25:01.626 --> 25:03.332
Kathy!

25:03.544 --> 25:04.374
No--

25:04.587 --> 25:05.702
Oh, god--

25:05.922 --> 25:06.502
Oh, god--

25:06.714 --> 25:08.250
The-- The-- The Peony plant.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.216
What?

25:09.425 --> 25:10.005
It's gonna stop the bleeding.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.207
It's the healing
plant of the gods.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.212
And it grows in the forest.

25:12.428 --> 25:12.757
Go!

25:12.970 --> 25:13.880
Okay.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.388
Ahhhhh!

25:17.600 --> 25:18.350
Bo...

25:18.559 --> 25:19.423
I've got to
get you out of here.

25:19.644 --> 25:20.508
You're dying.

25:20.728 --> 25:21.717
This woman is dying.

25:21.938 --> 25:22.472
No you don't understand.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.974
When you jumped from
that train, you got sick.

25:24.190 --> 25:24.975
You need help.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.180
No. She needs help, Dyson.

25:26.401 --> 25:26.981
And it's my fault!

25:27.193 --> 25:28.899
Help me fix this, okay?

25:29.112 --> 25:29.692
I can wait.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.110
Just keep pressure on the wound.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.152
Go!

25:32.365 --> 25:32.979
Get my Julia!

25:33.199 --> 25:34.234
I can't lose them both!

25:34.450 --> 25:35.565
Ah!

25:36.411 --> 25:38.572
On death's door,
and still helping humans.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.369
At least you're still you.

25:40.581 --> 25:41.411
Stay with me--

25:41.624 --> 25:43.410
Stay with me, stay with me--

25:43.626 --> 25:44.615
(laughing) Oh, man.

25:44.836 --> 25:47.794
Wh-Why can't we just...
erase everything.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.212
All the bad shit that's
ever happened to us,

25:50.425 --> 25:51.414
or that we've done.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.420
and just forget it all.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.677
Forget that horny boss
that kept grabbing my ass.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.342
Forget the wedding
dress and combat boots

25:59.559 --> 26:02.050
that I wore all the
way through freshmen year

26:02.270 --> 26:03.100
as a "statement."

26:03.312 --> 26:04.438
Yeah.

26:04.647 --> 26:05.727
Forget that--

26:05.940 --> 26:08.056
Forget that car that
I hit and then sped away,

26:08.276 --> 26:09.356
and didn't tell anyone.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.934
Until now.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.360
Actually it was three.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.357
What?

26:13.573 --> 26:14.358
(laughing) Go, go!

26:14.574 --> 26:15.063
Okay, okay, okay!

26:15.283 --> 26:17.023
Uh, forget the Master
I had for five years

26:17.243 --> 26:19.074
who kept me in
indentured servitude...

26:20.246 --> 26:21.201
What?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.538
It's probably
the beer talking.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.538
I guess I ran out
of bad shit to forget.

26:32.884 --> 26:37.093
Imagine we could really
forget all that stuff.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.767
What would we have left?

27:29.565 --> 27:30.850
Oh, my god...

27:35.238 --> 27:36.102
You know, I would
have been fine

27:36.322 --> 27:37.858
with just beer
and pizza, right?

27:38.074 --> 27:39.689
(laughing)

27:39.909 --> 27:41.524
Now she tells me.

27:48.668 --> 27:56.416
(Julia screaming)

27:56.634 --> 27:57.168
Grrrr!

27:58.970 --> 28:00.176
So, what's the plan?

28:00.388 --> 28:02.845
It's time for me to introduce
myself to this Jumbee.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.572
Wait...

28:23.578 --> 28:24.567
You?

28:24.787 --> 28:26.527
You shouldn't have done that.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.204
You shouldn't be meddling in
things that don't concern you!

28:29.417 --> 28:31.203
Clearly, you haven't
been out in the world

28:31.419 --> 28:34.877
for a while, so let
me get you up to speed.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.002
Hi, I'm Bo, the
unaligned Succubus,

28:39.218 --> 28:39.843
how are you?

28:40.052 --> 28:41.258
Just a couple
things about me...

28:41.470 --> 28:43.006
I like leather,
having a good time,

28:43.222 --> 28:44.803
and in case
you haven't noticed,

28:45.016 --> 28:47.428
| always meddle in things
that don't concern me.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.679
And if you don't stop
torturing these innocent people

28:49.896 --> 28:52.353
I'm gonna crack my foot
off in your retro ass!

28:52.565 --> 28:54.271
Torturing them?!

28:59.739 --> 29:01.525
They thought I was a witch.

29:02.992 --> 29:03.856
Hey, hey--

29:04.076 --> 29:06.533
Come on, boys,
we talked about this.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.280
Take your hands off her!

29:10.499 --> 29:11.830
Don't you hurt her!

29:13.753 --> 29:14.833
Get your hands off me!

29:15.046 --> 29:15.876
Let her go!

29:16.088 --> 29:16.998
(crying)

29:17.214 --> 29:18.829
John! Jesse!

29:19.050 --> 29:20.415
Noah!

29:21.218 --> 29:24.506
And they wanted
my fiancé, my Noah,

29:24.722 --> 29:26.462
to see me proved a witch.

29:26.682 --> 29:31.767
(struggling)

29:31.979 --> 29:33.264
Don't do this!

29:33.940 --> 29:34.554
Please!

29:34.774 --> 29:36.765
An elemental ain't no witch!

29:53.417 --> 29:57.410
My Noah saw what I really
was and he still loved me.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.164
No!

30:01.384 --> 30:01.918
(gun firing)

30:22.822 --> 30:25.313
They left us separate forever.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.671
And I ain't never gonna
stop until every last one

30:42.883 --> 30:44.794
of them Jenkins' is dead!

30:49.890 --> 30:50.675
(gaSP)

30:53.728 --> 30:55.514
They killed her.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.846
Your ancestors killed her.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.683
Her and her fiancé;
also a Jenkins, murdered her!

31:01.902 --> 31:02.527
Oh, god!

31:02.737 --> 31:03.101
So much anger!

31:03.320 --> 31:04.275
So much pain!

31:04.488 --> 31:06.194
She's never gonna stop!

31:06.407 --> 31:07.066
Ahhhhh!

31:07.283 --> 31:10.025
Why are they making
me pay for what they did?

31:10.244 --> 31:10.744
Ugh!

31:10.953 --> 31:12.363
Because the past
always comes calling.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.116
She's trying to take over!

31:14.331 --> 31:14.706
Ugh!

31:14.915 --> 31:15.574
Fight her, Bo!

31:15.791 --> 31:17.577
(groaning)

31:25.718 --> 31:27.174
Not bad.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.671
For a human.

31:28.888 --> 31:32.176
Well, I am always
at your disposal.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.175
Disposal?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.010
I like that.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.187
What was that?

31:47.406 --> 31:50.523
When I was in that
cell behind Vex's desk,

31:50.743 --> 31:52.699
I had a lot of time to think.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.200
I realized something
very important.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.201
Oh?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.248
What did you realize?

32:01.921 --> 32:04.333
That I've been far too nice.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.085
I know that Succubus was
somehow behind my capture.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.667
It's time somebody
finally put her in her place.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.718
I already did.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.056
Excuse me?

32:17.228 --> 32:18.343
She's gone.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.177
I helped Tamsin
get rid of her.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.523
For you.

32:21.899 --> 32:22.979
You know, I've been thinking,

32:23.192 --> 32:24.853
maybe I should come back here.

32:25.069 --> 32:26.855
I could live
here with you again.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.359
Oh...

32:29.406 --> 32:30.691
Honey...

32:31.909 --> 32:34.321
But then where
would I keep the dogs?

32:37.414 --> 32:38.870
What are you gonna do now?

32:41.418 --> 32:42.954
With Bo gone?

32:48.050 --> 32:49.665
Everything.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.351
(groaning)

33:04.567 --> 33:05.773
Separate forever!

33:05.985 --> 33:06.394
What?

33:06.610 --> 33:07.269
Separate forever.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.475
That's what the Jumbee said!

33:08.696 --> 33:10.232
I know what we have to do!

33:10.447 --> 33:12.278
Before they were married,
they were killed!

33:12.491 --> 33:13.867
They were buried separately!

33:14.076 --> 33:14.360
If we--

33:14.577 --> 33:15.191
If we what?

33:15.411 --> 33:16.321
No, no, I know, I know!

33:16.537 --> 33:18.744
Um, if we bury them
together then it will end

33:18.956 --> 33:20.537
the Jumbee's
need for vengeance.

33:20.749 --> 33:21.454
Ugh!

33:21.667 --> 33:23.123
Come on, you've been
around for a thousand years,

33:23.335 --> 33:24.871
and you've never
read a romance novel?

33:25.087 --> 33:26.827
Wow, you are a lucky girl.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.663
Take Kathy downstairs
and lock yourselves up.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.006
Be okay, okay?

33:32.887 --> 33:35.173
Dyson, you have to go
find their remains, okay?

33:35.389 --> 33:36.174
Just please hurry.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.425
I'm not leaving you, Bo!

33:37.641 --> 33:38.426
ljust found you!

33:38.642 --> 33:40.018
There's no way in hell I'm--

33:44.899 --> 33:45.854
Do you trust me?

33:46.066 --> 33:46.521
Yes.

33:46.734 --> 33:47.689
Then trust this.

33:47.902 --> 33:50.018
I can fight her, Dyson,
but you have to go.

33:50.237 --> 33:51.022
You have to hurry!

33:51.238 --> 33:52.523
Please, just go!

33:52.740 --> 34:00.533
(groaning and crying)

34:16.889 --> 34:19.471
0k, is this his leg bone
or the Jumbee's leg bone?

34:19.683 --> 34:20.388
Doesn't matter.

34:20.601 --> 34:21.716
It's all going
in the same place.

34:21.936 --> 34:24.018
Is this how your
dates with Bo usually go?

34:24.230 --> 34:26.516
Digging up graves, and
trying to save human lives?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.768
I'd be lying if I
said this didn't have

34:28.984 --> 34:30.360
some semblance of nostalgia.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.399
Okay, that's it.

34:31.612 --> 34:35.525
Are all of his
bits with her bits?

34:35.741 --> 34:36.275
Yeah, they are.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.284
Help me hold her down.

34:41.038 --> 34:41.993
Arhhhh!

34:43.374 --> 34:44.489
(snarling)

34:44.708 --> 34:45.618
(laughing)

34:45.834 --> 34:48.416
Oh, I'm gonna
enjoy killing you both.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.789
Hold her still--

34:50.381 --> 34:50.995
(groaning)

34:51.215 --> 34:52.045
They were never married!

34:52.258 --> 34:53.998
That's why she's
still stuck in limbo.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.091
If we marry them...

34:56.303 --> 34:58.089
maybe it will end the pain.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.263
Where did you find these?

35:03.811 --> 35:06.598
I take you to be
my lawfully wed wife

35:06.814 --> 35:08.930
to have and hold, in
sickness and in health,

35:09.149 --> 35:10.434
and even in death.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.185
Do you take me to be your--

35:14.405 --> 35:15.315
Noah...

35:18.242 --> 35:20.949
Do you take Noah to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

35:21.161 --> 35:24.073
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

35:24.290 --> 35:25.405
even in death?

35:26.625 --> 35:27.410
Yes.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.620
I do.

35:29.837 --> 35:42.261
if};

35:42.474 --> 35:44.430
What are you
guys looking at?

35:45.644 --> 35:46.850
You can't see them?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.041
Wait...

36:14.798 --> 36:16.754
(chuckling) Are we...?

36:16.967 --> 36:18.582
Ready to go home?

36:18.802 --> 36:20.633
Oh, hells yes.

36:21.555 --> 36:22.840
Yeah.

36:35.152 --> 36:38.235
(phone ringing)

36:38.447 --> 36:40.028
Good morning, Ronny!

36:40.240 --> 36:41.525
Grab the phone, would ya?

36:41.742 --> 36:44.028
Some yahoo's been calling
every ten minutes or so,

36:44.244 --> 36:46.200
asking about some "Karen."

36:46.413 --> 36:46.822
What?

36:47.039 --> 36:49.496
Yeah. Said there's a
big reward for information.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.414
Hardly had
time to do my prep.

36:51.627 --> 36:54.164
(phone ringing)

36:54.380 --> 36:56.086
You gonna answer it, Red?

36:56.882 --> 36:58.747
I actually have
to go to the washroom.

36:58.967 --> 37:05.338
(phone ringing)

37:08.394 --> 37:11.352
Uh, your kicks
have gone all ghetto.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.849
Oh, you want to borrow
my kitten heel Fly boots.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.852
They are tres
gorge and they might make

37:16.068 --> 37:19.731
this, um, homeless-persons-
nighty-thing you're rockin'

37:19.947 --> 37:21.528
look like an
actual fashion choice.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.776
You know how I know
you're gonna be okay?

37:23.992 --> 37:27.530
Because you've got balls
as big as my best friend.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.496
Who is a girl?

37:28.705 --> 37:29.694
Oh.

37:31.375 --> 37:32.330
Bye, babe.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.491
And don't be so hard on them.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.578
One day you might have to
face down your own demons...

37:37.798 --> 37:39.413
and they might come in handy.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.170
But if you ever need me,

37:43.387 --> 37:44.672
come find me.

37:53.981 --> 37:54.686
(knocking)

37:57.818 --> 37:58.898
(knocking)

38:01.989 --> 38:02.774
I need to leave.

38:02.990 --> 38:03.604
What?

38:04.158 --> 38:04.772
Town.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.072
I need to leave town.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.320
What are-- What are
you talking about?

38:07.536 --> 38:07.945
Leave when?

38:08.162 --> 38:09.072
Now!

38:09.288 --> 38:10.277
Look, I can't really explain--

38:10.497 --> 38:11.998
Look, I... will
come with you, okay?

38:12.207 --> 38:12.992
I can help--

38:13.208 --> 38:14.744
No! Look, just promise me,

38:14.960 --> 38:15.824
if anybody comes
looking for me,

38:16.044 --> 38:17.750
you'll pretend that
you never knew me.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.836
Where are you going? Just--

38:20.048 --> 38:21.174
Promise me.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.211
Promise.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.088
For luck.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.177
I really hope
you find some soon.

38:33.061 --> 38:33.766
Wait, wait, wait--

38:33.979 --> 38:35.560
Is there another
way outta here?

38:35.772 --> 38:36.352
Yeah.

38:36.565 --> 38:37.350
Come on.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.691
You're in an awful
rush for a sick girl?

38:40.903 --> 38:42.689
| just can't wait
to get into bed.

38:42.905 --> 38:44.190
(laughing)

38:44.406 --> 38:45.862
First thing's first.

38:49.244 --> 38:51.200
Clio, you wanna
do that ear thing?

38:54.708 --> 38:55.993
What do you think you're doing?

38:56.210 --> 38:57.825
Taking what's mine.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.081
Money talks,
and your buddy, Vex,

39:00.297 --> 39:01.662
has got boat loads of it.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.419
Do you really think you're
just gonna walk away with her?

39:04.635 --> 39:05.920
Let me put it this way.

39:06.136 --> 39:08.297
If you follow us
or try to stop me,

39:08.514 --> 39:10.846
then I'm gonna let the
transcendental sickness

39:11.058 --> 39:14.391
eat her insides and
then I'm gonna leave her

39:14.603 --> 39:18.642
in a hot and
bloody succubus mess.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.064
I don't mean
walk away from me.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.857
I mean walk away from her.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.153
What?

39:24.363 --> 39:26.900
Last time I checked,
Jumbees were elementals, too.

39:27.115 --> 39:27.740
Ahhh!

39:29.159 --> 39:31.195
See, that's the thing
about helping people, Clio.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.153
Sometimes you get paid back with
a little thing called Karma.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.078
Ow!

39:35.290 --> 39:36.370
Jumbee already healed me...

39:36.583 --> 39:37.743
and when she
was inside of you

39:37.960 --> 39:39.746
she saw exactly
what you were up to.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.372
This is just professional--

39:41.588 --> 39:44.170
Do you have any idea
how sick and tired I am

39:44.383 --> 39:46.169
of being double
crossed and lied to

39:46.385 --> 39:47.841
and generally dicked around!

39:48.720 --> 39:50.585
You picked the wrong
girl to screw over.

39:50.806 --> 39:54.515
Because I like to
make everything personal.

39:55.727 --> 39:56.352
(whack)

39:58.105 --> 39:58.560
(whack)

40:00.065 --> 40:00.599
(whack)

40:02.234 --> 40:02.893
Ow--

40:05.237 --> 40:06.192
What are you?

40:06.572 --> 40:08.108
She's your worst nightmare.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.701
Dying with a smile...

40:14.913 --> 40:18.622
That is much too
good a fate for you.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.663
Did you get a little medieval
while you were away?

40:26.883 --> 40:28.339
I don't know?

40:28.552 --> 40:29.507
Maybe.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.175
Oh...

40:30.387 --> 40:31.376
Hey...

40:33.390 --> 40:35.005
So...

40:35.225 --> 40:36.431
Vex, huh?

40:36.643 --> 40:38.349
Man, can that guy
pick a team already?

40:38.562 --> 40:39.517
You're one to talk.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.641
God, I missed you.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.520
I missed you too.

40:48.572 --> 40:49.687
Take me home?

40:50.407 --> 40:51.192
You got it.

40:51.408 --> 40:52.193
Yeah.

41:06.715 --> 41:08.330
I can't wait
to see everyone.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.166
Kenzi and Hale...

41:12.095 --> 41:14.051
Trick and...

41:14.723 --> 41:16.429
You know, some day
we're gonna have to talk

41:16.642 --> 41:18.098
about what happened
on that train.

41:20.646 --> 41:21.977
What train?

41:24.733 --> 41:26.189
I don't know.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.187
I don't know
why I said that...

41:30.072 --> 41:31.187
Don't worry.

41:33.033 --> 41:35.991
I will figure out
what happened to me.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.319
One way or another.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.369
You can be sure of that.

42:12.406 --> 42:13.270
(laughing)

42:13.490 --> 42:15.446
I'm not gonna
get rid of you, am |?

42:15.659 --> 42:17.445
Not that easy,
hop in, partner.

42:24.543 --> 42:25.658
You know what?

42:27.045 --> 42:28.831
I am really
happy to see you.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.259
And I'm really sorry.

42:33.468 --> 42:34.253
Why?

42:43.395 --> 42:46.137
You think we should stop
and see if they need help?

42:46.565 --> 42:47.520
Sorry, Bo.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.018
Gotta get you home.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.772
Whoever that is can
fix their own flat tire.
