Will?

00:55.447 --> 00:57.817
Will! Kate!

01:02.289 --> 01:04.290
Henry?

01:55.739 --> 01:57.741
Kate?

02:26.570 --> 02:28.471
Bloody hell!

02:47.323 --> 02:48.423
Henry!

02:53.398 --> 02:54.697
Henry, are you all right?

02:54.699 --> 02:56.432
Oh, head...

02:56.434 --> 02:57.600
Ow.

02:57.602 --> 02:59.903
Head. Ow...

02:59.905 --> 03:01.438
Oh, take it easy.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.940
You've had
a nasty blow.

03:02.942 --> 03:05.575
I think you have
a concussion.

03:05.577 --> 03:08.045
Henry, what the hell happened,

03:08.047 --> 03:10.013
and where are
the others?

03:10.015 --> 03:11.615
Uh..

03:11.617 --> 03:14.618
I don't remember...

03:14.620 --> 03:15.819
Henry!

03:44.536 --> 03:45.402
Welcome back.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.638
Wow.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.574
At least I only see
one of you now.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.343
Making progress, then.

03:52.345 --> 03:54.378
How are you feeling?
Any nausea?

03:54.380 --> 03:55.914
No, but I do have

03:55.916 --> 03:57.582
the entire cast of
<i>Stomp</i> in my head,

03:57.584 --> 03:59.184
and they're not happy.

03:59.186 --> 04:01.120
Ah, gently,
gently...

04:02.223 --> 04:03.456
Here.

04:05.192 --> 04:06.693
Take these for the pain.

04:06.695 --> 04:08.662
Thanks, Doc.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.034
Holy crap!

04:14.036 --> 04:15.969
Yeah, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

04:15.971 --> 04:17.271
What happened?

04:17.273 --> 04:18.338
Well, you tell me.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.373
The place
is a shambles,

04:20.375 --> 04:21.408
the front door
was unlocked,

04:21.410 --> 04:22.675
the alarms were off.

04:22.677 --> 04:24.210
There's no sign of Will,
or Kate, or--

04:24.212 --> 04:26.346
Let me think
for a second.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.217
What day is it?

04:30.219 --> 04:31.552
It's Tuesday.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.154
No, wait,

04:33.156 --> 04:34.555
you're here.

04:34.557 --> 04:36.557
I just got back
from the conference.

04:37.626 --> 04:38.760
So it's Thursday?

04:40.096 --> 04:41.463
What the hell happened
to Wednesday?

04:41.465 --> 04:42.331
What's your name?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.532
Henry Foss.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.466
And mine?

04:44.468 --> 04:45.567
Helen Magnus.

04:45.569 --> 04:47.336
All right,
so not total amnesia.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.338
Probably just
short-term memory loss

04:49.340 --> 04:51.073
resulting from
the blow to your head.

04:51.075 --> 04:53.341
Ah! Look at me.

04:53.343 --> 04:54.409
I'm bleeding.

04:54.411 --> 04:56.243
All right, all right,
take it easy.

04:56.245 --> 04:57.344
Think back.

04:57.346 --> 04:59.546
What's the last thing
you remember?

05:02.083 --> 05:04.050
Uh, it's Tuesday afternoon...

05:04.052 --> 05:06.486
<i>You called me into your office.</i>

05:06.488 --> 05:07.921
I'm just about to leave
for a conference.

05:07.978 --> 05:10.078
I won't be back
until the day after.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.346
<i>Then I'll fly in Thursday,</i>

05:11.348 --> 05:12.514
<i>meet you</i>
<i>in the afternoon.</i>

05:12.516 --> 05:13.782
Perfect.
I'll have my car

05:13.784 --> 05:14.817
pick you up
at the airport.

05:14.819 --> 05:16.185
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>you understand</i>

05:16.187 --> 05:17.620
<i>this is just</i>
<i>a pro forma inspection,</i>

05:17.622 --> 05:18.955
<i>but in light of several events</i>
<i>this past year--</i>

05:18.957 --> 05:20.056
Understood,

05:20.058 --> 05:21.458
and it's perfectly fine.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.959
I look forward to welcoming you
to the Sanctuary.

05:22.961 --> 05:25.329
<i>Until Thursday afternoon,</i>
<i>then. Goodbye.</i>

05:25.331 --> 05:27.231
Bye.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.900
Wow, who's the hottie?

05:28.902 --> 05:32.169
She is the chief of
the U.N. security team.

05:32.171 --> 05:34.037
She also speaks
four languages,

05:34.039 --> 05:36.973
was the American envoy
at the G-20 Summit,

05:36.975 --> 05:38.274
and has three PhDs

05:38.276 --> 05:39.976
in international law
and finance.

05:39.978 --> 05:41.277
Oh, my apologies.

05:41.279 --> 05:42.378
"Dr. hottie."

05:42.380 --> 05:43.846
Her name is
Lilian Lee,

05:43.848 --> 05:46.882
and I trust you'll be
on your best behavior?

05:46.884 --> 05:48.850
You need
to work on your jump.

05:48.852 --> 05:50.385
Dude, you're
seven feet tall!

05:50.387 --> 05:51.519
That's an unfair
advantage.

05:51.521 --> 05:52.521
Sore loser.

05:53.857 --> 05:55.390
I've got a plane to catch,

05:55.392 --> 05:56.792
but when I get back,

05:56.794 --> 05:58.260
I want this place
in tiptop shape

05:58.262 --> 05:59.628
for Dr. Lee's
inspection.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.130
You have a sizable amount
of paperwork

06:01.132 --> 06:02.865
on your desk.

06:02.867 --> 06:04.199
Yes, more filing.

06:04.201 --> 06:05.667
It's my favorite thing
in the world.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.869
Could you please
have it done by tomorrow?

06:07.871 --> 06:09.304
I want to be ready
in case of an audit,

06:09.306 --> 06:10.705
and Henry,

06:10.707 --> 06:12.140
the new abnormal
that arrived this morning?

06:12.142 --> 06:13.608
One cuddly little mollox
ready for intake.

06:13.610 --> 06:14.609
I am on it.

06:14.611 --> 06:16.512
Check security protocols,

06:16.514 --> 06:18.380
and make sure that the armory
is in proper order.

06:18.382 --> 06:20.283
No stray grenades.
Check.

06:20.285 --> 06:21.551
And I think
we should lock down

06:21.553 --> 06:23.053
some of the more
aggressive residents.

06:23.055 --> 06:24.221
Especially the Kryton
on Level Four.

06:24.223 --> 06:25.989
You know how nervous she gets
with new faces.

06:25.991 --> 06:27.324
You think
the U.N. Inspector

06:27.326 --> 06:28.625
would object to
being pelted

06:28.627 --> 06:30.594
with acidic
bile sacs?

06:30.596 --> 06:33.963
I think it's best
if we play it safe.

06:33.965 --> 06:36.065
Right, then, I'm off.

06:36.067 --> 06:39.101
Cell phone reception
can be a bit spotty in Gstaad.

06:39.103 --> 06:40.936
Oh, poor you.

06:40.938 --> 06:42.504
But I will be
briefing the other heads

06:42.506 --> 06:43.738
on hollow earth,

06:43.740 --> 06:45.306
so you can reach me
on a land line.

06:45.308 --> 06:46.440
Doc, don't worry
about it.

06:46.442 --> 06:48.309
We've got everything
under control.

06:48.311 --> 06:49.344
We're going to
pass this inspection

06:49.346 --> 06:50.345
with flying colors.

06:50.347 --> 06:51.379
Absolutely.

06:51.381 --> 06:52.380
You won't
recognize this place

06:52.382 --> 06:54.483
when you get back.

06:57.654 --> 06:59.221
Great.

06:59.223 --> 07:00.456
See you
in a day and a half, then.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.427
Bye!

07:04.429 --> 07:08.064
<i> After you left,</i>
<i>I went down to the intake area.</i>

07:08.066 --> 07:11.333
One mollox...

07:11.335 --> 07:16.271
Country of origin,
Sri Lanka.

07:16.273 --> 07:20.642
Date of birth, unknown.

07:20.644 --> 07:23.611
Name...

07:23.613 --> 07:26.446
Let's go with "Skippy."

07:28.484 --> 07:31.218
All right, Skippy,

07:31.220 --> 07:33.721
I think it's lunch time.

07:38.328 --> 07:39.728
Okay...

07:39.730 --> 07:41.630
Hey, you must be hungry,
little dude.

07:48.506 --> 07:50.039
Holy hell!

08:05.587 --> 08:06.719
Ah!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.062
Will, Kate, help!

08:19.033 --> 08:21.068
Come on!

08:29.577 --> 08:30.644
Oh, God...

08:31.646 --> 08:33.313
"Skippy," my ass.

08:36.318 --> 08:39.053
And then after that,
bupkiss.

08:39.054 --> 08:40.288
Odd.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.222
Yeah, tell me
about it.

08:42.225 --> 08:43.691
The mollox isn't
a violent creature.

08:43.693 --> 08:45.193
It's not even a carnivore.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.062
Then why did it try
to take a bite out of me?

08:47.064 --> 08:48.564
Good question.

08:48.566 --> 08:51.200
Perhaps it's a virus
of some kind.

08:51.202 --> 08:53.369
It might have been infected
during transport.

08:55.039 --> 08:56.039
Containment?

08:56.041 --> 08:58.175
Perimeter sensors are intact.

08:58.177 --> 08:59.676
I noticed that on the way
through the main gates.

08:59.678 --> 09:04.682
Okay, so nothing's escaped.

09:04.684 --> 09:06.016
I need to find that mollox,

09:06.018 --> 09:07.351
find the others,

09:07.353 --> 09:08.652
and find out what on earth
happened around here

09:08.654 --> 09:10.253
while I was gone.

09:12.490 --> 09:13.557
Damn.

09:13.559 --> 09:15.592
Security cameras
are down.

09:15.594 --> 09:16.660
What?

09:16.662 --> 09:18.194
That's impossible...

09:20.030 --> 09:21.297
Oh, what the hell?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.765
That video could've answered
a lot of questions.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.634
It's probably
just a glitch.

09:25.636 --> 09:27.035
Let me try a hot patch.

09:27.037 --> 09:27.835
Maybe that'll
reconnect the server.

09:27.837 --> 09:29.203
I'm going to check on the shoe,

09:29.205 --> 09:32.040
make sure all the habitats
are secure.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.242
All right.

09:33.244 --> 09:34.710
Here we go.

09:40.284 --> 09:41.218
Excuse me?

09:47.193 --> 09:49.227
Oh, come on, what do you mean
"access denied"?

09:49.229 --> 09:51.396
I'm the guy
that wrote your code!

09:58.089 --> 10:01.592
Will? Kate?

10:25.585 --> 10:27.219
I found our mollox.

10:27.221 --> 10:29.054
Yeah, deadly little
bastard, isn't he?

10:29.056 --> 10:30.055
Quite the contrary.

10:30.057 --> 10:31.923
He's his usual
docile self,

10:31.925 --> 10:34.326
not showing any signs
of viral infection.

10:34.328 --> 10:35.861
What?

10:35.863 --> 10:37.896
Why'd he go all Tasmanian
Devil on me, then?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.131
I'm running
some tests,

10:39.133 --> 10:40.466
but it's too early
to tell.

10:40.468 --> 10:42.167
I also called Declan.

10:42.169 --> 10:43.269
He's alerting the other
Sanctuary heads

10:43.271 --> 10:44.236
that we have a breach,

10:44.238 --> 10:46.305
and back-up
is standing by.

10:46.307 --> 10:47.239
How are you coming?

10:47.241 --> 10:49.140
Okay.

10:49.142 --> 10:50.875
I had to do a little
backdoor double-clutching

10:50.877 --> 10:52.344
to reset everything,

10:52.346 --> 10:53.578
but this should gain me access

10:53.580 --> 10:55.613
to the new passcode.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.249
Which is right...

10:58.251 --> 10:59.350
Right there.

10:59.352 --> 11:00.618
"Geddy Lee?"

11:00.620 --> 11:02.086
Yeah, it's the lead singer
of Rush.

11:02.088 --> 11:05.157
Isn't that
Will's favorite band?

11:05.159 --> 11:06.558
You don't suppose
it was Will who--

11:06.560 --> 11:08.461
locked me out?

11:08.463 --> 11:09.528
Hmm.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.897
Know what else
he did?

11:10.899 --> 11:12.932
He tried to wipe
the server hard drive.

11:12.934 --> 11:13.966
It's a good thing

11:13.968 --> 11:16.136
he didn't do
a final delete pass.

11:16.138 --> 11:17.471
This doesn't make
any sense.

11:17.473 --> 11:19.406
Why would Will compromise
our own security system?

11:19.408 --> 11:20.908
I don't know,

11:20.910 --> 11:22.443
but I'll tell you what,

11:22.445 --> 11:23.277
when I find him,
I'm gonna rip him a new--

11:23.279 --> 11:26.547
Whoa, hang on.
There we go.

11:26.549 --> 11:27.882
Can you clean up that image?

11:27.884 --> 11:29.918
No, not without doing
a full recovery,

11:29.920 --> 11:31.686
which will take some time.

11:31.688 --> 11:32.787
Hey, there's Will.

11:32.789 --> 11:34.322
Clearly being
pursued by someone.

11:34.324 --> 11:35.723
Or something.

11:35.725 --> 11:37.492
Or me!

11:37.494 --> 11:40.294
Why am I chasing Will?

11:42.964 --> 11:44.998
Why am I pointing a gun
at Will?

11:47.669 --> 11:49.203
I shot him?

11:49.205 --> 11:53.007
Oh, my God.

11:53.009 --> 11:54.675
I shot Will!

12:07.360 --> 12:08.861
What's wrong with me, Doc?

12:08.863 --> 12:09.895
Am I going crazy?

12:10.941 --> 12:12.674
Highly doubtful.

12:12.676 --> 12:14.309
I have a feeling

12:14.311 --> 12:15.644
there's a far more
prosaic reason

12:15.646 --> 12:16.878
for what's going on here.

12:17.947 --> 12:19.514
Yeah.

12:19.516 --> 12:21.349
Huh, okay...

12:22.585 --> 12:23.852
Why don't I remember
shooting Will, then?

12:23.854 --> 12:26.022
Huh?

12:26.024 --> 12:27.456
I know I forget
my cell phone number

12:27.458 --> 12:28.424
sometimes,

12:28.426 --> 12:29.492
or my Warcraft
passcode,

12:29.494 --> 12:30.527
but shooting Will

12:30.529 --> 12:32.795
should kinda
stick out in my memory.

12:32.797 --> 12:35.431
That's the residential
corridor.

12:35.433 --> 12:37.935
I passed by that
broken vase earlier.

12:37.937 --> 12:39.536
Will wasn't there anymore.

12:39.538 --> 12:41.572
I don't think
you killed Will, Henry.

12:41.574 --> 12:42.974
I think you just
stunned him.

12:42.976 --> 12:44.042
How do we know?

12:44.044 --> 12:45.043
Maybe I just stunned him

12:45.045 --> 12:45.944
so I could go back
for the kill

12:45.946 --> 12:47.379
and then hide the body.

12:47.381 --> 12:48.347
He's not
answering his radio.

12:48.349 --> 12:49.481
If will's alive, where is he?

12:49.483 --> 12:51.517
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

12:51.519 --> 12:53.652
I'm going to start
a systematic search

12:53.654 --> 12:54.753
of this facility,

12:54.755 --> 12:55.787
top to bottom.

12:55.789 --> 12:56.688
All right.

12:56.690 --> 12:57.989
Let me see

12:57.991 --> 12:59.858
if I can recover
some more video footage.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.359
Let's find out
what else I've done

13:01.361 --> 13:03.528
that I don't remember.

13:06.498 --> 13:07.565
Oh, come on!

13:09.734 --> 13:11.669
I have to go back to my lab

13:11.671 --> 13:13.337
and do a sector-by-sector
recovery of these files.

13:13.339 --> 13:14.838
Before you do,
just give me one second.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.673
Why? What
are you doing?

13:16.675 --> 13:19.543
I need to take
a sample of your blood.

13:19.545 --> 13:20.878
Aw, yeah, see,

13:20.880 --> 13:21.946
there is something
wrong with me.

13:21.948 --> 13:23.681
The mollox isn't
showing any signs

13:23.683 --> 13:25.016
of viral infection,

13:25.018 --> 13:27.319
but that doesn't mean
we can't rule out

13:27.321 --> 13:29.755
any airborne contaminants

13:29.757 --> 13:32.792
that might have slipped past
our quarantine protocols.

13:45.573 --> 13:47.574
No blood.

14:02.891 --> 14:04.859
Kate!

14:09.733 --> 14:12.902
I'm going to kill them!

14:12.904 --> 14:14.237
Who?

14:14.239 --> 14:16.172
Whoever did this to me!

14:16.174 --> 14:18.174
You don't know?

14:18.176 --> 14:21.477
No.

14:21.479 --> 14:24.781
I just woke up and...

14:24.783 --> 14:28.050
I found myself
lying here.

14:28.052 --> 14:29.185
God, my head...

14:29.187 --> 14:31.087
I'm beginning to detect
a pattern.

14:31.089 --> 14:33.189
All right.

14:33.191 --> 14:34.790
Tell me what you do remember.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.725
Um...

14:36.727 --> 14:41.129
Uh... I don't know, I...

14:41.131 --> 14:46.334
I... I just finished
organizing the armory

14:46.336 --> 14:48.502
and I passed by
Will's office...

14:48.504 --> 14:49.904
Hey, I'm gonna get a sandwich.

14:49.906 --> 14:50.838
You want anything
from the kitchen?

14:50.840 --> 14:53.073
Uh, yeah, um,

14:53.075 --> 14:55.810
how about something sharp
so I can slit my wrists?

15:00.249 --> 15:03.952
Uh... I don't suppose
you want--

15:03.954 --> 15:05.354
Yes! Yes, thank you.

15:05.356 --> 15:08.758
You can take
"A" through "L",

15:08.760 --> 15:11.195
and, Kate, I really
appreciate this.

15:11.197 --> 15:12.963
Oh, my pleasure.

15:12.965 --> 15:14.965
<i>Will, Kate, help!</i>

15:16.101 --> 15:17.334
The new intake.

15:17.336 --> 15:19.169
Henry?

15:21.907 --> 15:24.008
What the hell?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.043
Empty.

15:29.849 --> 15:32.017
There's
a walkie's gone.

15:32.019 --> 15:33.419
So is his stunner.

15:33.421 --> 15:34.353
I'll scope out
the upper levels.

15:34.355 --> 15:35.821
You take the lower.

15:35.823 --> 15:37.222
All right, let
the big guy know,

15:37.224 --> 15:39.091
and stay in radio contact.

15:39.093 --> 15:41.828
<i> So I headed onto</i>
<i>the residential corridors...</i>

15:41.830 --> 15:43.129
Hank?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.868
Hey, will,
I've got nothin' so far.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.136
How about you, any luck?

15:52.507 --> 15:55.242
Yo?
Come in, William.

15:57.512 --> 15:58.846
Weird.

15:58.848 --> 15:59.880
What's weird?

15:59.882 --> 16:01.548
First Hank
puts out a 911,

16:01.550 --> 16:03.283
and then disappears,

16:03.285 --> 16:04.451
and now will's gone awol.

16:04.453 --> 16:06.019
Have you seen
either of them?

16:06.021 --> 16:07.920
No, but let's check
the cameras.

16:13.994 --> 16:15.260
There he is.

16:15.262 --> 16:18.931
Hank, come in.
You okay?

16:18.933 --> 16:21.500
Dude, I can see you
on the monitor.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.602
Maybe his radio's off.

16:23.604 --> 16:25.370
No, he just used it
to call for help.

16:25.372 --> 16:27.439
Something <i> is</i> wrong.

16:31.010 --> 16:31.976
Keep an eye on him.

16:38.884 --> 16:40.951
Hey!

16:43.055 --> 16:44.488
You okay?

16:44.490 --> 16:46.089
Get the hell away!

16:46.091 --> 16:48.392
Okay, rewind.

16:48.394 --> 16:50.394
You're the one who called us
for help, remember?

16:50.396 --> 16:51.295
You almost gave Will
and me a heart--

16:54.899 --> 16:57.234
Holy crap, Hank!
Are you nuts?

17:17.523 --> 17:19.058
<i>The next</i>
<i>thing I know...</i>

17:19.060 --> 17:22.428
I wake up in the closet,
and you're...

17:22.430 --> 17:24.564
You're back early.

17:26.199 --> 17:28.601
It's Thursday.

17:28.603 --> 17:30.235
No, but that means...

17:30.237 --> 17:31.403
You lost a day.

17:31.405 --> 17:34.005
You and Henry both.

17:34.007 --> 17:35.640
Oh, my God...

17:35.642 --> 17:36.975
Hank tried to shoot me!

17:36.977 --> 17:38.644
He-he probably
doesn't remember it.

17:38.646 --> 17:41.046
He certainly doesn't remember
shooting Will.

17:41.048 --> 17:43.448
Will got shot too?

17:43.450 --> 17:44.682
Yeah, and I've yet
to find him.

17:44.684 --> 17:47.651
This is giving me
an ice cream headache.

17:47.653 --> 17:49.052
Join the club.

17:49.054 --> 17:50.554
It seems like everything
went pear-shaped

17:50.556 --> 17:52.622
shortly after Henry
processed the new intake.

17:52.624 --> 17:55.125
You think an abnormal
did this to us?

17:55.127 --> 17:56.526
I've checked the mollox.

17:56.528 --> 17:58.362
There's no sign
of any viral infection,

17:58.364 --> 18:00.631
and Henry's bloodwork
came back clean.

18:00.633 --> 18:03.333
Slight spike in adrenaline,
but that could be due to stress.

18:03.335 --> 18:05.636
So it's not contagious.

18:05.638 --> 18:07.637
And it's not
an airborne pathogen.

18:07.639 --> 18:10.173
But something clearly
altered our behavior

18:10.175 --> 18:11.307
and messed with
our heads, right?

18:11.309 --> 18:12.542
What does Biggie have to say?

18:13.977 --> 18:15.511
I haven't found him
yet either.

18:18.382 --> 18:20.549
Okay.

18:20.551 --> 18:22.518
What about the
surveillance videos?

18:22.520 --> 18:24.152
As a matter of fact,
I'm expecting an update.

18:24.154 --> 18:27.555
Henry, how
are you coming?

18:28.624 --> 18:30.257
Henry, come in.

18:31.593 --> 18:32.693
Dammit.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.161
I know, I shouldn't
have left him alone.

18:35.564 --> 18:37.331
I'm gonna kill you!

18:37.333 --> 18:38.432
Come on, come on!

18:41.605 --> 18:42.537
Bloody hell.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.438
You son of a bitch!

18:44.440 --> 18:45.722
I'm gonna kill you!

18:49.392 --> 18:50.726
Stop it!

18:50.730 --> 18:52.898
Stop it, both of you!

18:52.900 --> 18:53.865
Get off him!

18:55.703 --> 18:57.102
Will, enough!

18:57.104 --> 18:58.604
I have business
with him!

18:58.606 --> 19:00.706
I said time out!

19:03.412 --> 19:05.346
Somebody start talking,
and it better be good!

19:07.350 --> 19:08.282
--Tried to shoot me!

19:08.284 --> 19:11.485
One at a time!

19:11.487 --> 19:12.552
You first.

19:12.554 --> 19:15.422
No, no, no, me?

19:15.424 --> 19:17.557
No, I'm not the one
you should be concerned with.

19:17.559 --> 19:19.125
It's these two who
need to be locked up.

19:19.127 --> 19:19.960
Me? What'd I do?

19:20.388 --> 19:21.588
Nobody is doing
anything

19:21.590 --> 19:25.592
until I get
some answers.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.664
Now, it is obvious

19:27.835 --> 19:29.301
that the three of you
have fallen victim

19:29.303 --> 19:30.937
to some sort of
hallucinogenic pathogen.

19:30.939 --> 19:33.072
I do not know the method
of transmission,

19:33.074 --> 19:34.207
but I do know this--

19:34.209 --> 19:37.077
we will only solve
this problem

19:37.079 --> 19:38.946
if we approach it
scientifically,

19:38.948 --> 19:40.881
and not emotionally.

19:40.883 --> 19:41.816
All right.

19:41.818 --> 19:43.651
Fine.

19:43.653 --> 19:44.718
Fine.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.619
Fine.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.088
Now..

19:48.090 --> 19:49.556
Henry and Kate

19:49.558 --> 19:50.624
lost a sizable chunk of time,

19:50.626 --> 19:52.025
and I suspect you did as well.

19:53.027 --> 19:55.395
They were able to
tell me what happened

19:55.397 --> 19:56.229
up until the time
they blacked out.

19:56.231 --> 19:58.030
Now to you.

20:00.234 --> 20:02.068
I was in my office...

20:02.070 --> 20:04.170
<i>Sitting at my desk...</i>

20:04.172 --> 20:06.873
<i>Filing.</i>

20:06.875 --> 20:07.707
Level Four
and the shoe,

20:07.709 --> 20:08.775
all secure.

20:08.777 --> 20:09.710
Good.

20:09.712 --> 20:11.946
Oh, hey, uh...

20:11.948 --> 20:13.815
Does that mean
you're free?

20:13.817 --> 20:15.316
Why?

20:15.318 --> 20:19.254
Well, I could really use a hand
with all this paperwork.

20:19.256 --> 20:21.591
I'd love to, really,
but my hands...

20:23.994 --> 20:25.595
What about your hands?

20:25.597 --> 20:28.130
Too big and hairy.

20:28.132 --> 20:29.698
That's why
I gave up needlepoint.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.899
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

20:30.901 --> 20:32.734
so microsurgery
you can handle, it's fine--

20:32.736 --> 20:33.768
I've dusting to do.

20:33.770 --> 20:34.936
But filing is...

20:38.641 --> 20:42.242
He's a big hairy liar.

20:42.244 --> 20:44.644
Hey, I'm gonna get
myself a sandwich.

20:44.646 --> 20:45.946
Need anything from the--

20:45.948 --> 20:46.813
<i>I'm going to stop you there.</i>

20:48.917 --> 20:50.317
Kate, you said

20:50.319 --> 20:51.853
that Henry
called for help,

20:51.855 --> 20:54.089
and the two of you
came down here.

20:54.091 --> 20:55.857
Yes!

20:55.859 --> 20:57.125
Yes, he was missing,

20:57.127 --> 20:58.994
and the two of us
went looking for him

20:58.996 --> 21:00.729
because we care!

21:00.731 --> 21:02.397
I started on
the lower levels,

21:02.399 --> 21:03.231
and then worked my way up
to the residential area.

21:05.101 --> 21:07.669
Henry?

21:11.874 --> 21:13.207
Henry?

21:14.410 --> 21:16.811
Henry, come in.

21:19.181 --> 21:20.348
Hey,

21:20.350 --> 21:21.149
where you been, man?

21:23.452 --> 21:24.285
What the f--

21:24.287 --> 21:25.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

21:25.888 --> 21:27.020
Hey, hey...

21:27.022 --> 21:28.455
Hey, it's me!

21:29.146 --> 21:30.679
Dude, it's me, okay?

21:30.681 --> 21:31.680
Don't make me--

21:31.682 --> 21:32.414
Ah!

21:51.700 --> 21:52.600
<i> And after that?</i>

21:52.602 --> 21:54.035
<i> Well, I don't know,</i>

21:54.037 --> 21:55.404
because after that,

21:55.406 --> 21:57.106
I woke up on the floor
with a splitting headache!

21:57.108 --> 21:58.607
How many times do I
gotta say I'm sorry?

21:58.609 --> 22:00.676
I radioed for Kate,
no answer.

22:00.678 --> 22:03.512
Probably because he
had already taken me out.

22:03.514 --> 22:04.780
Guys, I'm sorry!

22:04.782 --> 22:06.715
I got in touch
with the big guy,

22:06.717 --> 22:10.186
and the two of us
went looking for him.

22:10.188 --> 22:11.520
Aw, dude...

22:11.522 --> 22:14.490
No, no, no, do not
"dude" me, okay?

22:14.492 --> 22:15.724
Do not use
the word "dude"

22:15.726 --> 22:16.758
in reference to me

22:16.760 --> 22:18.060
ever again!

22:18.062 --> 22:19.094
Will!

22:19.096 --> 22:20.062
Come on.

22:20.064 --> 22:23.031
It's obvious
Henry was not himself,

22:23.033 --> 22:25.934
and he has
apologized...

22:25.936 --> 22:28.503
For shooting you.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.106
The shooting?

22:32.108 --> 22:33.908
Oh, I'm all
over that.

22:33.910 --> 22:36.509
No, the shooting
was amateur hour

22:36.511 --> 22:38.178
compared to
what happened next.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.145
You want to
sweep the north wing,

22:39.147 --> 22:40.212
and I'll check out
the lab level?

22:40.214 --> 22:41.681
Sounds good.

22:41.683 --> 22:42.848
Okay, we'll meet back
in Magnus's office.

22:42.850 --> 22:43.949
Stay sharp.

22:43.951 --> 22:44.850
Yeah.

22:46.185 --> 22:47.886
Kate, come in.

22:47.888 --> 22:48.886
Kate!

22:50.624 --> 22:52.757
Whoa!

23:31.799 --> 23:32.865
Seriously?

23:32.867 --> 23:34.033
Ah!

23:35.603 --> 23:38.170
I'm not your lunch!

23:48.047 --> 23:50.849
Thanks.

23:54.621 --> 23:56.889
De nada.

24:00.194 --> 24:01.495
What is that smell?

24:01.497 --> 24:03.998
Uh... me.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.332
Why?

24:05.334 --> 24:06.866
Garbage compactor
tried to eat me.

24:06.868 --> 24:08.168
You're being attacked too?

24:08.170 --> 24:09.169
Uh-huh.

24:09.171 --> 24:10.536
Have you
called Magnus?

24:10.538 --> 24:13.105
Tried. All the com
systems are down.

24:13.107 --> 24:15.074
What about her cell phone?

24:15.076 --> 24:16.642
The em shields
are at full strength.

24:16.644 --> 24:17.843
Signal's scrambled.

24:20.147 --> 24:22.113
Come on.

24:25.984 --> 24:28.186
What?

24:28.188 --> 24:29.554
I'm not getting
in that elevator.

24:31.190 --> 24:32.291
This building's possessed,
again.

24:32.293 --> 24:34.660
It's not the building
this time.

24:34.662 --> 24:36.296
I got a good idea
who it is.

24:36.298 --> 24:39.232
<i> So we headed down</i>
<i>to the mainframe.</i>

24:39.234 --> 24:41.001
Henry!

24:41.003 --> 24:42.903
Stay away from me!

24:52.947 --> 24:54.948
Henry, this is crazy!

24:54.950 --> 24:56.049
Henry...

24:56.051 --> 24:57.116
What the hell's
the matter with you?

25:08.596 --> 25:09.796
Nice.

25:13.001 --> 25:15.703
I'm shutting down security.

25:15.705 --> 25:16.571
There's no telling
what kind of death trap

25:16.573 --> 25:18.306
he's put on auto-pilot,

25:18.308 --> 25:19.741
and just to be safe,

25:19.743 --> 25:21.076
I'm locking him out
with a new passcode.

25:21.078 --> 25:22.978
He'll have to be restrained.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.246
Yeah, go ahead.

25:24.248 --> 25:26.015
Where the hell is Kate?

25:33.756 --> 25:35.290
Hey, there you are!

25:35.292 --> 25:36.692
How come you haven't
answered your--

25:37.694 --> 25:38.694
Keep away from me.

25:38.696 --> 25:41.330
Don't come any closer.

25:42.699 --> 25:44.766
Oh, come on.

25:44.768 --> 25:45.734
First him and now you?

25:45.736 --> 25:47.135
I'm warning you.

25:47.137 --> 25:50.906
It's me, Will.

25:50.908 --> 25:52.974
Why don't you just
put the gun down--

25:54.210 --> 25:55.043
or not!

26:07.789 --> 26:09.357
Can somebody
please tell me

26:09.359 --> 26:12.360
what the hell's going on
with everyone around here?

26:18.667 --> 26:19.900
<i> That's when</i>
<i>it all goes blank.</i>

26:19.902 --> 26:21.202
A few minutes ago,

26:21.204 --> 26:22.870
I woke up
in the basement,

26:22.872 --> 26:24.272
I realized that
Benedict Arnold here

26:24.274 --> 26:26.874
had hacked back into
the security system,

26:26.876 --> 26:28.309
and since I didn't
feel like

26:28.311 --> 26:29.811
being sliced apart
by a laser--

26:29.813 --> 26:31.212
Look, I said
I was sorry, okay?

26:31.214 --> 26:32.380
I wasn't myself
at the time,

26:32.382 --> 26:34.649
and I don't remember
doing those things to you.

26:35.818 --> 26:38.052
Or you.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.723
What's a little gunfire
between friends?

26:41.725 --> 26:44.059
Will, Henry is fine now,
I assure you,

26:44.061 --> 26:45.894
as is Kate,

26:45.896 --> 26:48.263
and you seem to have
stabilized as well.

26:48.265 --> 26:49.298
Pfft.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.333
So, what are we
supposed to do?

26:51.335 --> 26:52.968
Just wait around

26:52.970 --> 26:54.870
until one of us
snaps again?

26:54.872 --> 26:56.838
We're obviously dealing
with an abnormal attack,

26:56.840 --> 26:59.107
some creature, or energy,

26:59.109 --> 27:01.076
determined to pit us
against each other.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.211
But to what end?

27:02.213 --> 27:03.579
Yeah, but what
kind of abnormal

27:03.581 --> 27:06.115
gets its rocks off
wanting to see us fight?

27:06.117 --> 27:09.184
None that I can think of,
and that's the problem.

27:09.186 --> 27:10.952
There's obviously
a deeper purpose

27:10.954 --> 27:12.754
to this whole scenario.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.456
Somebody who wants
to eliminate us,

27:14.458 --> 27:16.824
or take over
the Sanctuary,

27:16.826 --> 27:18.326
again.

27:18.328 --> 27:20.294
Ethernet connection
is up again.

27:20.296 --> 27:21.829
Good, I want
a video conference

27:21.831 --> 27:22.797
as soon as possible--

27:22.799 --> 27:23.931
Uh-oh.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.800
Emails are
coming through,

27:25.802 --> 27:28.202
and there's one from
Lilian Lee's office.

27:28.204 --> 27:29.371
"My afternoon flight
was canceled."

27:29.373 --> 27:30.973
Ah, thank God.

27:30.975 --> 27:34.244
"I will be taking
an earlier flight."

27:34.246 --> 27:37.280
"Will be arriving
Thursday at 11:00 a.m."

27:37.282 --> 27:40.251
That was like
three hours ago.

27:42.721 --> 27:44.388
You don't think
she's...jere?

27:44.390 --> 27:46.490
Did any of you...

27:46.492 --> 27:48.125
No!

27:49.161 --> 27:52.163
But we wouldn't
remember anyway.

27:52.165 --> 27:54.065
Ah, we are screwed.

27:54.067 --> 27:56.167
All right, let's not panic.

27:56.169 --> 27:57.167
Really?

27:57.169 --> 27:59.503
Because we have
trashed the place,

27:59.505 --> 28:00.770
we've attacked
each other,

28:00.772 --> 28:03.073
there's a psychosis-inducing
abnormal on the loose,

28:03.075 --> 28:05.041
we may have killed
the U.N. Security Inspector.

28:05.043 --> 28:06.209
Call me crazy,

28:06.211 --> 28:08.211
but this seems like
a pretty excellent time

28:08.213 --> 28:09.779
to panic.

28:09.781 --> 28:11.115
You guys hear that?

28:11.117 --> 28:12.316
No, I don't
hear anything.

28:12.318 --> 28:13.284
What are you picking up?

28:14.454 --> 28:15.320
A bell.

28:15.322 --> 28:17.356
In the south corridor.

28:17.358 --> 28:18.524
All right,
we'll check it out.

28:18.526 --> 28:20.192
You stay here,
get that video restored.

28:37.045 --> 28:39.012
It's coming
from in here.

28:42.049 --> 28:44.383
Henry hasn't got
the systems online yet.

28:44.385 --> 28:45.952
All right,
let's do it manually.

28:52.859 --> 28:54.960
Took you long enough.

29:01.389 --> 29:02.423
Hang on.

29:02.425 --> 29:05.092
Whoa, dizzy.

29:05.094 --> 29:07.995
Yeah, it's all the blood
rushing from your head.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.897
How long were you
hanging up there?

29:09.899 --> 29:12.533
I don't know.

29:12.535 --> 29:14.402
Who did this to you?

29:14.404 --> 29:16.137
It must have
been something big.

29:16.139 --> 29:18.572
Can't...Remember.

29:18.574 --> 29:19.540
I thought
all the abnormals

29:19.542 --> 29:21.909
were secured.

29:21.911 --> 29:24.178
You...

29:24.180 --> 29:25.913
Whoa-ho, whoa!

29:25.915 --> 29:27.481
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:27.483 --> 29:28.515
What did I do?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.630
You stay away from me!

29:53.043 --> 29:54.677
Oh... Henry.

30:01.317 --> 30:02.651
Enough.

31:14.789 --> 31:16.390
And then nothing.

31:16.392 --> 31:19.226
Two minutes ago
I woke up in the elevator.

31:19.228 --> 31:20.527
You locked me
in the closet.

31:20.529 --> 31:21.394
Had to.

31:21.396 --> 31:22.262
And you
drugged us.

31:22.264 --> 31:23.229
For your own safety.

31:24.498 --> 31:26.332
Can we just declare
complete amnesty

31:26.334 --> 31:27.934
for all past
transgressions?

31:27.936 --> 31:29.402
Please.

31:29.404 --> 31:32.772
The last thing I need right now
is a bunch of in-fighting.

31:36.576 --> 31:38.044
Fine.

31:39.581 --> 31:41.581
Do you think we'll ever
get back our memories?

31:41.583 --> 31:42.783
With time,
I hope so.

31:42.785 --> 31:43.984
If we could fill in
those lost hours,

31:43.986 --> 31:45.619
we could answer
a lot of questions.

31:45.621 --> 31:46.653
Exactly.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.155
For example,

31:48.157 --> 31:50.725
if everyone was knocked out
by the sleeping gas,

31:50.727 --> 31:52.427
who strung you up
in the elevator?

31:52.429 --> 31:53.795
<i>Hey, Doc, come in.</i>

31:53.797 --> 31:55.297
Go ahead, Henry.

31:55.299 --> 31:56.731
<i>Think I've finally</i>
<i>got something.</i>

31:56.733 --> 31:58.066
<i>It ain't perfect, but--</i>

31:58.068 --> 31:59.802
I'll take it.
We're on our way.

32:03.406 --> 32:04.506
Thanks.

32:32.502 --> 32:34.603
Stop right there.

32:34.605 --> 32:35.638
Isn't that--

32:35.640 --> 32:37.239
Dr. hottie.

32:37.241 --> 32:38.340
The U.N.
Security Chief?

32:38.342 --> 32:40.442
Carrying a stunner.

32:40.444 --> 32:42.577
Oh, this is
not good.

32:50.554 --> 32:51.754
How did she get in?

32:52.268 --> 32:54.002
Will shut down all
the security protocols.

32:54.092 --> 32:56.125
Because they were
trying to kill me.

32:56.127 --> 32:57.560
Where is she?
I haven't seen her.

32:57.562 --> 32:58.462
None of us have.

32:58.464 --> 33:00.163
You think she's infected?

33:00.165 --> 33:01.465
Well, why else
would she shoot Biggie?

33:01.467 --> 33:03.567
Self defense?

33:03.569 --> 33:05.369
I didn't touch her.

33:05.371 --> 33:06.404
I don't think.

33:08.807 --> 33:10.208
Henry, can you rewind the video

33:10.210 --> 33:12.610
back to the part where will
was lying on the floor?

33:12.612 --> 33:14.212
You
spotted Dr. Lee?

33:14.214 --> 33:16.581
No, but something,
perhaps.

33:34.801 --> 33:35.633
Nice.

33:35.635 --> 33:37.869
Don't mention it.

33:39.339 --> 33:41.239
Henry, go back again.

33:41.241 --> 33:43.309
And slow it down this
time, frame by frame.

33:51.151 --> 33:51.818
There!

33:51.820 --> 33:52.652
Magnify.

33:55.455 --> 33:56.422
Ugh!
What was that?

33:56.424 --> 33:57.590
Aw, gross.

33:57.592 --> 33:58.724
Doesn't even begin
to cover it.

33:58.726 --> 34:00.192
Don't worry.

34:00.194 --> 34:01.026
Don't worry, it's
not on you anymore.

34:01.028 --> 34:02.294
How do you know?

34:02.296 --> 34:03.696
Because you're not
trying to kill us.

34:03.698 --> 34:05.330
Do you know
what this is?

34:05.332 --> 34:06.799
It's called a Pinnepex,

34:06.801 --> 34:08.600
a creature so incredibly ugly

34:08.601 --> 34:10.503
that it's developed
a unique defense mechanism.

34:10.505 --> 34:11.771
It makes you
crazy?

34:11.773 --> 34:12.871
It releases

34:12.873 --> 34:14.674
a powerful pheromone
into the bloodstream

34:14.676 --> 34:16.409
that compels stronger
creatures to protect it.

34:16.411 --> 34:17.543
It must have come in

34:17.545 --> 34:18.744
hitching a ride
on the mollox.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.646
Oh, that's why
skippy attacked me.

34:20.648 --> 34:22.447
Skippy?

34:22.449 --> 34:24.583
On Tuesday, when Henry
uncrated the mollox,

34:24.585 --> 34:26.418
the Pinnepex must have
jumped over to him.

34:26.420 --> 34:30.357
So, then what, I'm just
under its spell after that?

34:30.359 --> 34:31.458
One of the side effects
of the pheromones

34:31.460 --> 34:33.393
is rapid adrenaline production,

34:33.395 --> 34:34.460
which would account for

34:34.463 --> 34:35.896
your increased strength
and aggression.

34:35.898 --> 34:37.397
Okay, so any time

34:37.399 --> 34:38.966
any one of us was
shot or taken out--

34:38.967 --> 34:40.501
it jumped over to
the next protector.

34:40.503 --> 34:41.835
Exactly.

34:41.837 --> 34:43.937
So you knew about
the roofie monster?

34:43.938 --> 34:46.672
Well, this creature was
supposed to have been extinct

34:46.675 --> 34:47.908
for the last 50 years.

34:47.909 --> 34:49.243
I'm guessing
that's why

34:49.245 --> 34:50.411
its biological
signature

34:50.413 --> 34:51.378
never registered.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.913
It was never
in our database.

34:52.915 --> 34:54.415
Oh, guys, I think
I've found our Pinnepex.

34:57.419 --> 34:58.886
She's headed for
the catacombs.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.588
We can't go
in there unprotected.

35:00.590 --> 35:01.890
If that creature
were to jump

35:01.892 --> 35:03.392
onto one of us...

35:03.394 --> 35:04.794
Yeah, we could
turn on each other.

35:04.796 --> 35:06.295
Again.

35:08.298 --> 35:12.035
I think I may have
a solution.

35:12.037 --> 35:15.605
The sex inhibitor pheromone
of the red bollworm.

35:15.607 --> 35:17.273
Pfft. Why didn't I
think of that? Ow.

35:17.275 --> 35:20.009
Obviously this is a hastily
engineered synthetic,

35:20.011 --> 35:21.811
but it should do the trick.

35:21.813 --> 35:23.279
No sex?

35:23.281 --> 35:24.680
I don't need
a shot for that.

35:24.682 --> 35:27.783
It should provide us
with temporary immunity

35:27.785 --> 35:31.553
to the Pinnepex.

35:31.555 --> 35:34.056
Three of us will enter
via the basement tunnels.

35:34.058 --> 35:35.391
Henry, Kate,

35:35.393 --> 35:36.325
go in through the vaults
under the courtyard.

35:36.327 --> 35:37.626
Check.

35:37.628 --> 35:38.727
And let's try it
the easy way first.

35:38.729 --> 35:39.829
Failing that,

35:39.831 --> 35:41.597
standard
3-2 formation

35:41.599 --> 35:42.865
with defensive
extraction.

35:42.867 --> 35:44.533
And stun only, please.

35:44.535 --> 35:45.934
I want to capture
both the Pinnepex

35:45.936 --> 35:48.002
and the U.N.
Security Chief alive.

35:48.004 --> 35:50.806
Tranqs it is.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.544
So far, so good.

35:55.546 --> 35:57.279
Do you see her?

35:57.281 --> 35:58.280
I'll hit the end
of the basement

35:58.282 --> 35:59.515
by the boilers.

35:59.517 --> 36:01.016
Maybe I'll go wide,
do an end run...

36:07.491 --> 36:08.692
On second thought...

36:08.694 --> 36:10.327
Cover me.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.031
Whoo!

36:18.090 --> 36:19.325
Dr. Lee!

36:19.391 --> 36:21.558
Lilian! We're not here
to hurt you!

36:22.727 --> 36:23.760
Oh!

36:23.762 --> 36:25.095
Back off!

36:25.097 --> 36:27.231
Don't come any closer!

36:27.233 --> 36:28.299
So much for
the easy way.

37:02.234 --> 37:03.535
Will...

37:11.344 --> 37:13.512
Well done, everyone.

37:13.514 --> 37:14.713
It's ugly.

37:14.715 --> 37:17.549
Well, I'd rather be
ugly than extinct.

37:17.551 --> 37:18.417
You--

37:18.419 --> 37:21.253
nah, too easy.

37:22.423 --> 37:23.923
Don't you listen to them.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.625
I think you're beautiful.

37:29.130 --> 37:31.265
Okay, well, that's half
our problem solved.

37:31.267 --> 37:33.467
What about miss
united nations over here?

37:33.469 --> 37:35.135
Well, luckily,
like the rest of you,

37:35.137 --> 37:36.169
she won't remember a thing.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.537
That's
the final stage

37:37.539 --> 37:39.038
of the creature's
defense system.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.207
Once the pheromone wears off,

37:41.209 --> 37:44.176
the predator doesn't remember
that the Pinnepex ever existed,

37:44.178 --> 37:45.544
so it doesn't
go looking for it.

37:45.546 --> 37:47.279
It's rather ingenious, really.

37:48.414 --> 37:50.348
Right.

37:50.350 --> 37:51.550
While she's sleeping this off,

37:51.552 --> 37:54.920
we've got some
cleaning up to do.

37:59.893 --> 38:00.960
...And so I
agree with you,

38:00.962 --> 38:02.629
these new quarantine
protocols are--

38:04.032 --> 38:06.900
oh, dear, not again.

38:06.902 --> 38:08.369
What..?

38:08.371 --> 38:09.737
Where..?

38:09.739 --> 38:11.172
I'm afraid you've had
another episode.

38:11.174 --> 38:12.907
Dr. Magnus?

38:12.909 --> 38:14.442
I was really hoping

38:14.444 --> 38:17.546
these little blackouts
had stopped.

38:17.548 --> 38:19.114
W-what blackouts?

38:19.116 --> 38:21.984
How did I..?

38:21.986 --> 38:23.419
You honestly don't remember?

38:25.122 --> 38:27.157
Well, at least your pulse
is back to normal.

38:27.159 --> 38:28.358
Now, tell me,

38:28.360 --> 38:30.560
what's the last thing
you can recall?

38:31.562 --> 38:34.664
When I landed, I called.

38:34.666 --> 38:37.266
I couldn't get an answer,
so I took a cab over here.

38:37.268 --> 38:38.634
And that's when
you hit your head.

38:38.636 --> 38:39.669
I what?

38:39.671 --> 38:41.137
Getting out of the cab.

38:42.339 --> 38:43.272
I came down
to the gate

38:43.274 --> 38:44.607
to meet you.

38:44.609 --> 38:46.475
I apologized for
not getting your earlier email,

38:46.477 --> 38:47.643
otherwise of course
my car would have been

38:47.645 --> 38:49.377
waiting for you
at the airport.

38:49.379 --> 38:50.678
You were stepping
out of the cab,

38:50.680 --> 38:52.313
and you struck your head
on the door.

38:52.315 --> 38:53.748
I did?

38:53.750 --> 38:55.450
Caused a total
blackout.

38:55.452 --> 38:56.918
You came to
a few seconds later,

38:56.920 --> 39:00.288
but there have been
a couple of recurrences.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.289
It's all very odd.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.091
Here you go,
Dr. Lee.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.427
Milk, no lemon,
just like you asked.

39:06.429 --> 39:08.696
Uh, doctor..

39:08.698 --> 39:10.164
Zimmerman.

39:14.703 --> 39:16.470
I'm afraid we've had
another blackout.

39:17.973 --> 39:19.207
Okay.

39:19.209 --> 39:20.976
I know you
only asked for

39:20.978 --> 39:22.544
the last six months
of security logs,

39:22.546 --> 39:25.214
but it was just as easy
to pull the entire year,

39:25.216 --> 39:26.649
and besides,

39:26.651 --> 39:28.051
we've got
nothing to hide.

39:28.053 --> 39:30.120
You're telling me
we've met?

39:30.122 --> 39:31.622
And I asked for those?

39:31.624 --> 39:34.057
Oh, another blackout.

39:34.059 --> 39:35.592
Minor one.

39:35.594 --> 39:37.061
I'm hoping it's the last.

39:37.063 --> 39:38.462
In fact, I anticipate
a full recovery --

39:38.464 --> 39:40.731
just hang-
hang on.

39:40.733 --> 39:42.533
Something's not right here.

39:42.535 --> 39:44.268
How about
a sip of tea?

39:44.270 --> 39:45.370
What about
a cookie?

39:45.372 --> 39:47.205
You may have
low blood sugar.

39:47.207 --> 39:48.607
It's starting to
come back to me now.

39:48.609 --> 39:49.441
It is?

39:49.443 --> 39:51.209
Yes.

39:51.211 --> 39:52.577
Yes, the front door
was unlocked.

39:53.747 --> 39:54.646
The front door
is never unlocked.

39:54.648 --> 39:55.814
I walked inside.

39:55.816 --> 39:57.515
On your own,

39:57.517 --> 39:58.649
without entering
the security code?

39:58.651 --> 40:00.317
There was a chair overturned

40:00.319 --> 40:01.552
on the floor,

40:01.554 --> 40:03.387
and some crates

40:03.389 --> 40:04.555
stacked up high,

40:04.557 --> 40:08.124
and then a big, furry Sasquatch

40:08.126 --> 40:10.193
came straight at me,
and-and...

40:10.195 --> 40:12.228
That's it.

40:12.230 --> 40:14.563
Well, sometimes
the mind can play tricks--

40:14.565 --> 40:17.500
don't patronize me,
any of you.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.235
Do you think I got
to where I am

40:20.237 --> 40:22.738
by being an idiot?

40:22.740 --> 40:25.507
No, we don't,
I assure you.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.177
Then please have the decency
to be honest with me.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.114
You're right.

40:33.516 --> 40:34.717
The truth is,

40:34.719 --> 40:36.519
there was a situation

40:36.521 --> 40:38.054
with our most
recent intake.

40:38.056 --> 40:39.756
Which
inadvertently admitted

40:39.758 --> 40:42.326
a psychosis-inducing
abnormal

40:42.328 --> 40:43.627
into the Sanctuary.

40:43.629 --> 40:45.262
Basically,
we all went postal

40:45.264 --> 40:46.197
and trashed the place.

40:46.199 --> 40:47.298
You came in

40:47.300 --> 40:48.566
at the tail end
of the event,

40:48.568 --> 40:50.468
and were temporarily
infected yourself.

40:50.470 --> 40:51.569
But you're fine now.

40:51.571 --> 40:52.603
We all are.

40:53.638 --> 40:55.272
You realize, Dr. Magnus,

40:55.274 --> 40:56.706
that this is
a very serious event.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.174
I do,

40:58.176 --> 41:00.877
but there's something
you must understand.

41:00.879 --> 41:02.645
Our perimeter security
was never compromised--

41:02.647 --> 41:04.713
this time.

41:08.083 --> 41:10.452
Dr. Lee...

41:10.454 --> 41:11.853
This is a Sanctuary.

41:11.855 --> 41:13.455
It's not a zoo.

41:13.457 --> 41:15.090
We deal with
abnormal creatures,

41:15.092 --> 41:17.560
and, yes, sometimes
they're dangerous.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.529
That's why we're here.

41:19.531 --> 41:21.230
It's what we do,
it's our job,

41:21.232 --> 41:24.267
and quite frankly,
we're good at it.

41:24.269 --> 41:27.103
We've been good at it
for 149 years.

41:29.139 --> 41:30.773
I see.

41:34.144 --> 41:36.613
So tell me...

41:36.615 --> 41:38.648
What exactly did happen to me?

41:40.551 --> 41:42.352
Come take a look.

41:49.794 --> 41:51.828
This is
Henry shooting me.

41:51.830 --> 41:55.198
There's Will
going after me.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.767
Will, crashing
through a table.

41:57.769 --> 42:00.537
What the
hell am I doing?

42:00.539 --> 42:02.372
Well...

42:03.508 --> 42:05.275
I believe

42:05.277 --> 42:08.378
you're trying to
kill my colleagues,

42:08.380 --> 42:11.381
but I'm willing
to overlook it.

42:12.616 --> 42:14.617
Dr. Lee, in my work,

42:14.619 --> 42:16.218
the United Nations
has always been

42:16.220 --> 42:18.520
a very powerful ally.

42:18.522 --> 42:19.955
I hope you'll
think of me

42:19.957 --> 42:22.390
in the same way.

42:25.227 --> 42:28.562
Please,
call me Lilian.

42:28.564 --> 42:30.931
Thank you.

42:30.933 --> 42:33.234
Now, if you're
still interested,

42:33.236 --> 42:34.502
we'd be delighted
to give you

42:34.504 --> 42:37.572
a proper tour
of the Sanctuary.

42:37.574 --> 42:40.374
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

42:41.510 --> 42:42.910
This way.

42:48.484 --> 42:50.318
You've done this
before.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.854
Once or twice.
