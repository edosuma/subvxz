00:42.875 --> 00:44.583

of pioneers

00:44.667 --> 00:46.458

on the frontier.

something else?

00:52.041 --> 00:55.458

a certificate.

00:55.542 --> 00:56.625
Toshi got one.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.750
Carries it in his wallet
instead of a condom.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.333
He's been drowning in muff.

01:00.417 --> 01:03.250
Well, he's straightedge,

01:03.333 --> 01:06.417
Oh, here we go.
Time to hit the trail!

01:09.375 --> 01:11.250

11:05.917 --> 11:06.834
Stoive?!

11:06.917 --> 11:09.250
Roiger!
I knew you were alive!

11:09.333 --> 11:12.375
Why'd you do this?
Roger, we're your family.

11:12.458 --> 11:13.917
Well, it's better
if you're not!

11:14.000 --> 11:15.375
Because when you
love something

11:15.458 --> 11:17.542
and you know you're gonna
lose it, it hurts!

11:17.625 --> 11:18.875
And I can't keep doing it!

11:18.959 --> 11:22.208
Keep doing it?
I loved another family once.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.709
As much as you guys.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.333
They were pioneers...

11:25.417 --> 11:26.709
Wait a minute.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.291
I thought you landed in Roswell
in the '40s.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.542
The second time.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.208
The first time,
I was with my Aunt Carolynn.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.959
She had always been
a bad driver.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.250
A little thing like
her nephew's Nerf football

11:36.333 --> 11:38.000
bouncing on
the light-speed button

11:38.083 --> 11:40.750
and she was all, "Blaah!
Brace for impact!"

11:40.834 --> 11:42.625
She was killed instantly.

11:42.709 --> 11:44.709
Oh, my God.
That's terrible!

11:44.792 --> 11:47.166
Oh! Are we --
Are we both telling this story?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.417
No?
Okay, then.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.583
Now, without further
interruption --

11:50.667 --> 11:54.583
Where was I?
Damn. Enh, forget it!

11:54.667 --> 11:56.500
Nah, nah. It's a good story.
I'm gonna finish it.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.208
Anyway, that's when I met
the Meekers,

11:59.291 --> 12:01.875
a family of fur trappers.

12:02.834 --> 12:06.125
They took me in, treated me
as one of their own,

12:06.208 --> 12:09.375
and I joined them
on their trip to Oregon.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.959
♪♪

12:12.041 --> 12:13.291
Things were going great

12:13.375 --> 12:15.625
till one of our wagon wheels
popped off.

12:15.709 --> 12:21.333
♪♪

12:21.417 --> 12:25.000
That was an incredibly
long hill.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.291
And I was exhausted,

12:26.375 --> 12:28.625
but I was in better shape
than the Meekers.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.667
♪♪

12:40.291 --> 12:41.792
Roger, I'm so sorry.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.792
Now it makes sense
why you're out here

12:43.875 --> 12:45.583
retracing
the Oregon Trail.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.083
I am?
I had no idea.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.125
I thought I was just following
Soul Asylum

12:50.208 --> 12:52.125
from county fair
to county fair.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.959
But playing Oregon Trail
with you

12:55.041 --> 12:57.000
stirred up memories
of the Meekers.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.709
And I realized I-I'm gonna
outlive the Smiths, too.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.917
That's why I faked my death,
hit the road,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.500
and became
a famous renegade.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.166
But, Roger, people live
so much longer now.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.375
I mean, with advancements
in technology,

13:09.458 --> 13:11.250
who knows how long
we'll be together.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.208
Technology, huh?

13:13.291 --> 13:14.709
Hadn't really thought
about that.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.417
It's a big deal these days,
isn't it?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.834
What do you say?
Ready to come home?

13:18.917 --> 13:21.083
Stop fretting about the time
we don't have

13:21.166 --> 13:23.291
and start enjoying
the time we do.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.458
Technology, baby!

13:28.291 --> 13:30.083
Look who I found!

13:30.166 --> 13:31.333
Yeah!

13:31.417 --> 13:32.667
Roger!
You're alive!

13:32.750 --> 13:35.333
Mah-zurrah!
I'm sorry I left you guys,

13:35.417 --> 13:37.166
and I can't give you back
the last year,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.333
although it looks like
you all were doing great.

13:39.417 --> 13:42.542
What I can do is pick up
right where we left off.

13:42.625 --> 13:43.875
The car accident?

13:43.959 --> 13:46.417
No, silly!
Jerking off at our sleepover!

13:46.500 --> 13:48.125
I don't think that we agreed
on that.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.583
All right, Steve.
Play it cool for your parents.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.000
I thought we could start
with a little Motorcycle Mayhem.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.542
Nah! Come on, big daddy.
Let's fire up that Dutch oven.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.458
Roger, I thought
you'd never ask.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.875
Oh, this boy
is so strong!

14:08.959 --> 14:10.208
Roger, help!

14:10.291 --> 14:11.667
Hold on, buddy!

Oh, good. You're all awake.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.417
Stan: What the hell?
You were right, Steve.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.500
With technology,
I'll never have to worry

14:30.583 --> 14:31.959
about outliving you guys.

14:32.041 --> 14:35.208
You'll be safe and sound
inside my Macintosh.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.125
You mean our Macintosh?!

14:37.208 --> 14:40.083
Seriously? That's your biggest
concern right now?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.417
Roger, get us out
of this computer!

14:46.500 --> 14:47.834
I'm putting my foot down!

14:47.917 --> 14:49.250
That's cute.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.667
But your foot's over here.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.750
Why are you doing this to us?!

14:53.834 --> 14:55.083
It's for your own good!

14:55.166 --> 14:57.291
You used to live
in these vulnerable bodies.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.250
Bodies break down.
Look!

15:01.500 --> 15:03.000
Ugh!
I'm gonna be sick.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.542
No.
That's the point.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.250
You're never gonna be sick
again.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.834
Thanks to technology,
you'll live as long as me.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.792
Roger, this is not
what I meant.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.250
You're so humble, Steve.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.667
But when you started blabbing
about technology this

15:14.750 --> 15:17.250
and technology that,
it dawned on me.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.333
If the CIA can put
Klaus' mind

15:19.417 --> 15:21.417
in a fish's body
or Stan's car,

15:21.500 --> 15:23.875
they should be able to put
the family in a computer.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.792

to this?

15:25.875 --> 15:27.125
Not at first.

15:27.208 --> 15:30.458
But it turns out Dr. Weitzman
is a big fan of $20.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.250
Just my luck.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.000
Another scumbag thief.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.417
Do you have any bags
of marshmallows

15:42.500 --> 15:44.166
that aren't
all melted together?

15:44.250 --> 15:45.667
No!
That's fine.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.208
Probably packing heat.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.000
Getting robbed at gunpoint

15:49.083 --> 15:51.542
would be hell
on my profit margins.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.834

in the house.

into MacPaint,
