WEBVTT

00:00.894 --> 00:03.960
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:04.200 --> 00:06.200
- Brian, Spaz is dead!
- I don't know who

00:06.202 --> 00:08.269
that is.
Oh, no!

00:08.271 --> 00:11.439
No...
Hey!

00:11.441 --> 00:13.441
- Well...
- All right.

00:13.443 --> 00:15.476
- There we go.
- What's going on, guys?

00:15.478 --> 00:17.478
Just Rafi being Rafi.
Guys, I got bad news.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.480
I got to go deal with a case in
Houston again, tomorrow.

00:19.482 --> 00:21.482
Aw.
These shrimp fishermen are

00:21.484 --> 00:23.384
suing an oil company, and I'm
like, "What are you gonna cook

00:23.386 --> 00:26.988
your shrimp in?" Is that your
opening argument? Basically.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.623
Fishermen are such
dicks.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.625
Well, if you're gonna be in
Houston, you should hit up J.J.

00:30.627 --> 00:32.327
Watt.
I keep calling him.

00:32.329 --> 00:34.329
I guess he changed his number.
His Twitter must be broken,

00:34.331 --> 00:36.064
too.
I've been DM'ing him. Nothing.

00:36.066 --> 00:38.066
You know what, you have not
invited us to your house in a

00:38.068 --> 00:40.068
while.
I want to make sure that the

00:40.070 --> 00:42.070
Ruxin is proudly displayed on
your mantel.

00:42.072 --> 00:44.138
You talking about the Sacko?
I am talking about the trophy

00:44.140 --> 00:47.342
formerly known as the Sacko, now
called the Ruxin.

00:47.344 --> 00:49.677
Exhibit "A": your address.
Don't you worry your cute

00:49.679 --> 00:51.679
little pancake face about it.
It's there, it's up.

00:51.681 --> 00:53.681
I'm not buying it.
Something's fishy, man.

00:53.683 --> 00:55.783
What we should be worrying
about is people changing team

00:55.785 --> 00:57.785
names mid-season.
Well, I had to.

00:57.787 --> 00:59.787
Ellie was asking too many
questions about "The Pleasures

00:59.789 --> 01:01.789
of Andre's Sister."
Well, we have all the answers

01:01.791 --> 01:03.858
for her, just...
Yeah, that's what I'm trying

01:03.860 --> 01:05.492
to avoid.
So we just changed it to

01:05.495 --> 01:08.029
something a little more G-rated.
"Too Hot to Handle"?

01:08.031 --> 01:10.031
Yeah, I like it.
This is something you're

01:10.033 --> 01:12.200
gonna have to worry about once
Geoffrey starts asking questions

01:12.202 --> 01:14.202
about <i>your</i> team name.
Oh, "Pete Top/Kevin Bottom"?

01:14.204 --> 01:16.270
No, I didn't have to explain it
to him.

01:16.272 --> 01:18.106
He intuitively understood that
you were the submissive.

01:18.108 --> 01:21.876
Now that everyone's here,
I have a big announcement to make...

01:21.878 --> 01:24.645
Uncle Frank died.
What?

01:24.647 --> 01:30.718
But the good news is he left me...
his van. Whoa, rapist van!

01:30.720 --> 01:32.720
You got the van?
It's like brand-new.

01:32.722 --> 01:34.722
When he became handicapped, he
couldn't drive it anymore.

01:34.724 --> 01:36.724
Which means Taco Corp finally
has a headquarters.

01:36.726 --> 01:38.726
Y'all know that was the only
thing holding me back.

01:38.728 --> 01:40.561
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You were right there, you

01:40.563 --> 01:44.198
know? I have so many plans for this thing.
Let us know when you're gonna

01:44.200 --> 01:46.200
do the anniversary of you
getting molested in there.

01:46.202 --> 01:48.302
I wasn't molested.
It was "Secret Wrestling Camp."

01:48.304 --> 01:50.405
Okay, I'm out.
So much fun.

01:50.407 --> 01:52.183
Ah... whoa!

01:52.303 --> 01:59.025
"<font color=""#ec14bd"">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color=""#ec14bd"">www.addic7ed.com</font>"

02:00.369 --> 02:02.919
What's going on up here?
I am cleaning out the guest

02:02.921 --> 02:04.921
bedroom while you're out of
town, so if there is anything

02:04.923 --> 02:07.490
you want to save, you better
grab it now because it is going

02:07.492 --> 02:09.481
in the trash if not.
Okay, babe.

02:11.153 --> 02:14.125
Oh.

02:14.242 --> 02:18.444
This can go.
Later, buddy.

02:18.446 --> 02:26.552
Pete's records... can go.
Whoa, the old porn stash.

02:26.554 --> 02:29.489
What was I doing buying this?
Oh, 'cause of her.

02:29.491 --> 02:31.123
Rodney?
Yeah, babe!

02:31.125 --> 02:32.758
How's it going?
Good.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.794
Okay, I'm gonna empty out the
closet.

02:34.796 --> 02:38.798
I'm gonna continue to do
things that are normal.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.833
Hey.

02:40.835 --> 02:42.835
You still good to drive me to
the airport tomorrow?

02:42.837 --> 02:44.504
Yeah, I'll pick you up on the
way.

02:44.506 --> 02:46.506
Okay, we need to leave a few
minutes early so I can throw

02:46.508 --> 02:48.508
some stuff away in a Dumpster.
What did you do, Ruxin?

02:48.510 --> 02:50.510
I didn't do anything.
I just have some old porn that

02:50.512 --> 02:52.512
I need to get rid of.
You don't want it?

02:52.514 --> 02:54.514
No, I don't want your porn.
I've got the Internet and my

02:54.516 --> 02:56.516
dark thoughts, thank you.
I guess it is a little "Too

02:56.518 --> 02:58.284
Hot to Handle."
Road trip!

02:58.286 --> 03:00.286
Did you hear that?

03:00.288 --> 03:02.088
So you got me tomorrow morning?

03:02.090 --> 03:04.156
I will be at your house in
the morning.

03:04.158 --> 03:06.592
Okay, thanks. I love you.
Don't... say that.

03:06.594 --> 03:09.161
Hey, babe?
I'm gonna take one of these

03:09.163 --> 03:11.163
boxes to the bathroom and
just sort through it.

03:11.165 --> 03:14.000
Bye.
Honey?

03:14.002 --> 03:16.002
What are you doing out here?
I-I'm waiting for Kevin to

03:16.004 --> 03:18.337
pick me up.
He's late.

03:18.339 --> 03:20.473
Uh, what's in the box?
Oh, it's, uh, work stuff.

03:20.475 --> 03:23.276
Ah! It's, uh, evidence.
I don't want to implicate you.

03:23.278 --> 03:25.344
I... love you too much.
Okay.

03:25.346 --> 03:26.979
Thanks, babe.

03:26.981 --> 03:32.051
Oh, this-this better be Kevin.
Hi. Where are you?

03:32.053 --> 03:34.787
I'm late for the airport.
My car is gone, Ruxin!

03:34.789 --> 03:37.023
It's gone!
And judging by the hot steamer

03:37.025 --> 03:39.458
that someone left in my bushes
with Hubba Bubba in it, I think

03:39.460 --> 03:41.460
Rafi stole it.
Yeah, well, what about my

03:41.462 --> 03:43.129
ride?
It's too late to call a cab now.

03:43.131 --> 03:45.131
Your ride?
I'm dealing with a crime scene

03:45.133 --> 03:46.832
on my driveway, Ruxin.
There are dolls with syringes

03:46.834 --> 03:48.701
in it.
When are you picking me up?

03:48.703 --> 03:50.703
What about my car?!
Airport.

03:50.705 --> 03:52.338
Car!
Airport!

03:52.340 --> 03:56.208
Car! Ah... Babe, I can take you.
Oh, okay, great.

03:56.210 --> 03:58.210
Uh, let me just, uh, throw this
away real quick and...

03:58.212 --> 04:03.749
What? No, that is evidence.
Right, it's... evidence.

04:03.751 --> 04:09.155
Oh, what have you seen?
Jenny!

04:09.157 --> 04:11.157
Thank you for forgiving me.
You're very welcome.

04:11.159 --> 04:13.159
All right.
Made it on time.

04:13.161 --> 04:14.994
Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.
Text me when you get in.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.596
Call you as soon as I get
there.

04:16.598 --> 04:18.697
I love you, babe. Bye.
I love you, too. Bye.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.000
I love you.
Love you! Bye!

04:21.002 --> 04:22.602
I got to get rid of this porn.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.604
All right.
Hey, what's up, man?

04:24.606 --> 04:26.505
How you doing? Good to see you.
Here, take this. Just take it.

04:26.507 --> 04:28.507
You want me to take your box?
Yeah.

04:28.509 --> 04:30.110
What is it?
It doesn't matter what it is.

04:30.111 --> 04:33.779
Just take it. I want to know what's in that box.
Fine, it's-it's porn.

04:33.781 --> 04:35.781
Check it out.
It's, like, dirty stuff, too.

04:35.783 --> 04:37.783
Like "choke 'em out" stuff.
God, you're freaking me out,

04:37.785 --> 04:39.785
man.
No, there's, like, "really

04:39.787 --> 04:41.420
hairy bush" stuff.
Use the Internet like the

04:41.422 --> 04:43.422
rest of us, pal.
Some of us like vintage

04:43.424 --> 04:45.591
stuff, bro!
Never forget your roots!

04:45.593 --> 04:49.028
Goddamn it. I just need to get
on my flight.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.030
Sir?
You can't leave this box here.

04:51.032 --> 04:53.032
I can't hear.
No, sir, you need to take the

04:53.034 --> 04:54.800
box with you.
No, it's cool, man.

04:54.802 --> 04:56.869
No, no, it's not cool.
It's cool, bro.

04:56.871 --> 04:58.471
Sir, this box cannot stay here.

04:58.473 --> 05:00.473
Okay, you know what, man?
It's filled with porn.

05:00.475 --> 05:02.475
You can have all of it.
What do you think?

05:02.477 --> 05:04.644
I don't want your porn, sir.
Well, what about some, like,

05:04.646 --> 05:06.379
"hood rat" shit?
Is that what you want?

05:06.381 --> 05:08.381
Listen, I see something, I
have to say something.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.383
If you see an interracial
gang bang, you could say you

05:10.385 --> 05:12.385
want it.
Now you're offending me.

05:12.387 --> 05:14.587
Take the box and go.
There's gay stuff.

05:14.589 --> 05:16.656
I don't even know how it ended
up in the box!

05:16.658 --> 05:18.290
Taxi!
Hey.

05:18.292 --> 05:20.159
Hey, man, where you going?
Uh, just the box, actually.

05:20.161 --> 05:22.161
Huh? No, I don't want this
box.

05:22.163 --> 05:24.096
Just drive it to the city
limits-- that's all I'm asking.

05:24.098 --> 05:25.931
Hey! Hey, get out of my cab.
I don't want that box...

05:25.933 --> 05:27.933
I'm not getting in your cab.
There's no need for this.

05:27.935 --> 05:29.802
Is there a problem here?
This terrorist is trying to

05:29.804 --> 05:31.804
give me this box.
Terrorist?

05:31.806 --> 05:33.572
I'm not a terrorist.
Sir, what's in the box?

05:33.574 --> 05:35.574
Nothing's in the box.
I'm just running late for my

05:35.576 --> 05:37.476
flight.
It's filled with porn.

05:37.478 --> 05:39.478
It's not like it's a bomb.
Bomb! He said "bomb"!

05:39.480 --> 05:41.647
No, not a bomb!
On the hood of the car now!

05:41.649 --> 05:43.482
No, not a bomb! I'm say...
Spread 'em!

05:43.484 --> 05:45.651
I'm saying "Not a bomb"!
Stop saying "bomb," sir.

05:45.653 --> 05:47.653
I'm not saying "bomb"!
You hold on to that box, you

05:47.655 --> 05:49.321
sick son of a bitch.
There's no bomb in here.

05:49.323 --> 05:51.157
Stop saying "bomb"!
I'm not saying "bomb"!

05:52.987 --> 05:57.242
Behold, Taco Corp's latest
venture, Taco's Truck.

We even have a patio where
you can sit back, relax and

enjoy some ice-cold Three Penis
Wine Coolers alfresco.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.445
Oh, get out of here, you little

06:46.447 --> 06:49.314
bastard.
Get out! Oh.

06:49.316 --> 06:52.117
Think his special sauce is
bug spray?

06:52.119 --> 06:54.586
Taco's Truck has earned four
Michelin tires.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.588
Ooh, that's interesting.
No, it's not.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.624
Nothing says "classic
American fare" like "Taco's

06:58.626 --> 07:03.095
Truck."
Ow! You... Ah, son of a bitch!

07:03.097 --> 07:05.497
Oh, sweet Jesus.
You guys really needed four

07:05.499 --> 07:08.233
hours to prove that a box of
porn was, in fact, a box of

07:08.235 --> 07:10.402
porn?
I take my job very seriously.

07:10.404 --> 07:12.604
Don't forget your filth.
"Don't forget your

07:12.606 --> 07:15.007
filth."
Adios, wanker.

07:20.147 --> 07:22.581
Hey, babe.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.650
I haven't heard from you.
How's Houston?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.819
Oh, how's Houston?
You're not gonna believe...

07:26.821 --> 07:29.488
how hot and muggy it is here.
I miss you.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.490
I miss <i>you.</i>
<i>It's gonna be so hard to be</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:33.492
<i>away from you for the whole</i>
<i>week.</i>

07:33.494 --> 07:35.494
<i>But I love you.</i>
<i>I'm gonna miss you so much.</i>

07:35.496 --> 07:37.629
<i>Mwah.</i>
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

07:37.631 --> 07:39.698
<i>So, Sofia still thinks</i>
<i>you're in Houston?</i>

07:39.700 --> 07:42.167
<i>Yeah, I decided it was a bad</i>
<i>idea to tell her that I was</i>

07:42.169 --> 07:47.306
<i>busted at the airport for 23</i>
<i>pounds of vintage pornography.</i>

07:47.308 --> 07:49.641
<i>Look, all I got to do is cover</i>
<i>a few hours of videoconferencing</i>

07:49.643 --> 07:51.844
<i>to Houston, and then the rest of</i>
<i>the week is mine.</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:53.846
<i>Oh, Ruxin's got himself a</i>
<i>little bye week.</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:55.848
<i>Sofia gets Terrific Lady</i>
<i>Days-- I'm gonna get myself a</i>

07:55.850 --> 07:57.850
<i>Terrific Ruxin Week.</i>
<i>Yeah! Sounds like somebody's</i>

07:57.852 --> 07:59.551
<i>gonna have an affair.</i>
<i>You want me to go have an</i>

07:59.553 --> 08:01.553
<i>affair?</i>
<i>Sounds like you want to have</i>

08:01.555 --> 08:03.222
<i>an affair.</i>
<i>Sounds like you</i> want to have

08:03.224 --> 08:05.224
an affair.
I would never have an affair.

08:05.226 --> 08:06.992
Why?
Fear.

08:06.994 --> 08:09.061
Look, as long as Sofia and
Rafi don't see me, I am good

08:09.063 --> 08:11.163
to go.
You don't have to worry about

08:11.165 --> 08:13.165
Rafi-- Rafi's off in California
committing crimes with my

08:13.167 --> 08:15.167
vehicle.
Hello, boys.

08:15.169 --> 08:17.169
You no longer have to eat this
garbage because Taco's Truck is

08:17.171 --> 08:19.238
up and running.
Great.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.306
Sign me up for some nachos.
No, we don't sell those.

08:21.308 --> 08:22.908
Why does everyone keep asking
that?

08:22.910 --> 08:24.910
Anyway, I'd love for you guys to
come by, sample some food.

08:24.912 --> 08:26.712
And like us on "MyFace"-- we're
trying to spread the word

08:26.714 --> 08:28.714
off-line.
Absolutely not.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.516
I got to get out of here.
I got to get back to work.

08:30.518 --> 08:32.417
Before you guys go, can I
crash at one of your places this

08:32.419 --> 08:36.054
week? Why don't you just get a hotel?
No paper trail-- can't use a

08:36.056 --> 08:37.688
credit card, no ATM machines,
nothing.

08:37.691 --> 08:41.326
Can't stay at my place. Yeah, it's
too soon after Trixie. Who's Trixie?

08:41.328 --> 08:43.061
I have a date this week, so
you're out of luck.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.063
I guess you could stay with
me-- I'm only using two thirds

08:45.065 --> 08:47.166
of my bed right now.
It's not gonna be a free ride,

08:47.168 --> 08:49.168
though-- you're gonna work with
me on the truck.

08:49.170 --> 08:50.769
Or go back to your wife and
kids.

08:50.771 --> 08:54.573
Mmm. Think I'll work for this
bucket of meat loaf. Meat loaf.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.575
We should serve that.
That's a good idea.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.610
Honestly, doing menial labor
is like spring break compared to

08:58.612 --> 09:01.046
taking care of my child.
All right, let's get to work.

09:01.048 --> 09:03.048
Grab all of this stuff.
Mmm.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.050
I don't have any plates.
Here, Ruxin, why don't you

09:05.052 --> 09:06.685
take this with you.
Cutlery.

09:06.687 --> 09:08.687
Enjoy yourself.
I don't regret my decision.

09:08.689 --> 09:12.391
Get to work! Let's go!
Hi.

09:12.393 --> 09:14.393
Hi. Is your husband home?
No.

09:14.395 --> 09:16.395
I thought you already knew.
He's in Houston.

09:16.397 --> 09:20.399
Houston. Well, do you mind if we come
in and have a look around? Uh...

09:20.401 --> 09:24.069
Just a few questions.
Lovely home.

09:24.071 --> 09:26.071
It'd be a shame to lose it.
I'm really sorry for the

09:26.073 --> 09:28.073
mess.
It's really difficult having a

09:28.075 --> 09:29.708
baby...
Did you have to wear the hat?

09:29.710 --> 09:31.710
What? I never get a chance to
wear it.

09:31.712 --> 09:37.649
God. So...  So...
Sofia.

09:37.651 --> 09:39.985
Is that a hearth?
That's a hearth.

09:39.987 --> 09:42.254
Ever put anything on that
hearth?

09:42.256 --> 09:44.256
Plants.
Hmm.

09:44.258 --> 09:46.391
Andre.
One second.

09:46.393 --> 09:48.393
Got to talk to my partner.
What's up?

09:48.395 --> 09:52.397
Mmm. Can I get you guys anything to drink?
No, I think we'll ask the

09:52.399 --> 09:58.437
questions from here. We'll ask
the questions... from here. Go.

09:58.439 --> 10:00.439
- Go ahead.
- What do you mean,

10:00.441 --> 10:02.074
"go ahead"?
I thought you had a question.

10:02.076 --> 10:04.643
I just teed you up.
That was for you.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.346
How's your day?
Oh, God. Okay.

10:07.348 --> 10:09.348
Have you seen a large, mounted
bust of Ruxin?

10:09.350 --> 10:11.083
No, I haven't.
<i>Never</i> seen it?

10:11.085 --> 10:12.684
No.
Never ever?

10:12.686 --> 10:14.686
No.
Never ever, ever?

10:14.688 --> 10:16.788
No.
So you never ever, ever,

10:16.790 --> 10:19.791
ever, never ever, ever, ever,
ever, forever ever saw it?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.793
No.
Ever.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.862
No.
Oh, I eat people like you for

10:23.864 --> 10:26.932
breakfast and shit you out
before I'm even done with my

10:26.934 --> 10:29.534
first cup of coffee.

10:29.536 --> 10:31.770
So if that's your story and
you're sticking to it...

10:31.772 --> 10:33.805
Mm-hmm.
...then you'd have no problem

10:33.807 --> 10:35.807
having us take a look around the
house.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.809
That's right.
I'll start in the kitchen.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.512
Uh-uh. I don't think so.
Ow, ow...

10:40.514 --> 10:42.881
You and that stupid, ugly
hat, get out of my house.

10:42.883 --> 10:44.883
I never get a chance to wear
it.

10:44.885 --> 10:47.552
Man, she's mean.
Yeah.

10:47.554 --> 10:50.889
Holy shit.
She threw it away.

10:50.891 --> 10:54.326
Uh-uh. <i>He</i> threw it out.
That is low.

10:54.328 --> 10:56.695
Oh, my God.
My Shore record.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.363
I was looking for this.
Wait a second.

10:58.365 --> 11:00.399
This is a jacket that I gave
Ruxin for his birthday.

11:00.401 --> 11:04.069
And a matching hat. Here, you hold
this, I'll get that, okay. Okay.

11:04.071 --> 11:05.804
Let's get out of here.
All right.

11:05.806 --> 11:11.901
Okay. I need two orders of chicken
wings and a lemonade at table three.

11:11.903 --> 11:13.769
Two order chicken wings,
lemonade, coming at table three.

11:13.771 --> 11:15.605
All right, hurry it up!
Hey.

11:15.607 --> 11:18.741
Hi. Welcome to Taco's Truck.
I'm Taco. What can I get you?

11:18.743 --> 11:21.477
I'd like a chicken burrito.
No, we don't do burritos.

11:21.479 --> 11:23.613
Oh, chicken nachos.
No, no chicken nachos.

11:23.615 --> 11:25.615
It's just American food.
Well, it's a taco truck.

11:25.617 --> 11:28.451
It's <i>Taco's</i> Truck.
Read the menu.

11:28.453 --> 11:31.454
It's "T-A-C-O-
uppercase comma-S."

11:31.456 --> 11:33.289
Yeah, all right, uh, uh,
cheeseburger.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.291
Thank you. It's about time.
Cheeseburger!

11:35.293 --> 11:37.226
Hamburger with cheese coming
up.

11:37.228 --> 11:39.795
And where are those fries?
Table three's waiting.

11:39.797 --> 11:41.631
Sorry, he's new.
I'll be right back.

11:41.633 --> 11:44.767
Yeah.
Ow... ow.

11:44.769 --> 11:46.602
Hey, shit-sipper, you're six
orders behind.

11:46.604 --> 11:48.504
What's going on?
I'm cooking as fast as I can.

11:48.506 --> 11:50.439
You got a tiny hibachi here.
You're not supposed to cook

11:50.441 --> 11:52.174
all the way through the meat.
Yeah, you are.

11:52.176 --> 11:53.943
Leave it raw on the inside.
You're wasting heat.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.745
By the way, you don't have
any soap left.

11:55.747 --> 11:57.647
I can't wash my hands with
anything.

11:57.649 --> 11:59.615
Oh, princess wants me soap.
Ruxin, I don't think you realize

11:59.617 --> 12:01.350
this, but the stuff I steal
costs money.

12:01.352 --> 12:03.319
Yeah.
And why aren't you wearing

12:03.321 --> 12:05.154
the hairnet I gave you?
'Cause the hairnet you gave

12:05.156 --> 12:08.090
me is just a lacy thong, and
from how stiff it is, I believe

12:08.092 --> 12:10.092
it's been used.
Of course it's used.

12:10.094 --> 12:13.029
That helps it catch the hair.
Just... hurry up.

12:13.031 --> 12:14.964
Sorry about that.
Can I add a churro, please?

12:14.966 --> 12:16.766
No, we don't serve Italian
food, either.

12:16.768 --> 12:18.534
The only non-American item we
have is Three Penis Wine, and

12:18.536 --> 12:20.202
that's Chinese.
Three Penis Wine?

12:20.204 --> 12:22.138
Three Penis Wine!
No, no, no, I don't want one.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.040
Three Penis Wine coming up.
No.

12:24.042 --> 12:27.710
Thank you. No refunds, sir. I don't
want a Three Penis Wine. Another one?

12:27.712 --> 12:29.478
Two Three Penis Wines!
No, no, no, no, not two...

12:29.480 --> 12:33.316
Six Penises Wine. I don't want any
Three Penis Wine. Curly fries are up.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.184
About time.
What are you doing in there?

12:35.186 --> 12:37.653
Been drinking some of the
Three Penis Wine.

12:37.655 --> 12:39.789
Can't blame you for that.
All right, hurry up.

12:39.791 --> 12:41.624
You're drinking that?
Yeah, I'm flipping the

12:41.626 --> 12:44.026
burgers with my donger; it's
rock-hard.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.962
Okay, I'll try one, then.
Can you believe these idiots?

12:45.964 --> 12:47.863
Everyone keeps ordering Mexican
food.

12:47.865 --> 12:49.999
I swear, I'm just gonna shut
this truck down and open a food

12:50.001 --> 12:51.701
stand instead.
Taco stand.

12:51.703 --> 12:53.636
<i>Taco's</i> stand.
Hmm, I think you'll find

12:53.638 --> 12:55.638
you'll have a similar problem.
I don't follow.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.306
Why would you?
Where's my sandwich?

12:57.308 --> 12:59.175
All right, tuna melt's coming.

12:59.177 --> 13:00.843
Hamburger with cheese.
Great, thanks.

13:00.845 --> 13:02.678
Just keep it, man.
Oh, keep the change.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.513
All right.
Still no Mexican?

13:04.515 --> 13:06.349
No, but the wings are
delicious.

13:06.351 --> 13:08.150
Yeah, I thought at least
they'd have a chalupa, right?

13:08.152 --> 13:11.754
Oh, shit, I have to put Chalupa down
before Jenny gets home. I got to go.

13:11.756 --> 13:13.422
I'll see you guys later.
All right.

13:13.424 --> 13:15.591
Well, now that I've made my nut
for the day, I think I'm gonna

13:15.593 --> 13:17.259
take off.
You know what?

13:17.261 --> 13:18.928
You're in trouble.
You have not been proudly

13:18.930 --> 13:20.763
displaying the Ruxin on your
mantel.

13:20.765 --> 13:22.698
Busted.
Oh, wait, did Sofia try to

13:22.700 --> 13:24.567
throw that out?
Bullshit. Don't give me that.

13:24.569 --> 13:26.335
You orchestrated this whole
thing so she would throw it

13:26.337 --> 13:28.404
away.
I don't know, it was on the

13:28.406 --> 13:30.172
mantel when I left.
You know how those Latin ladies

13:30.174 --> 13:32.942
are.
They got a mind in their own.

13:32.944 --> 13:35.411
Look, I'm gonna get out of here,

13:35.413 --> 13:38.581
go drink a good bottle of red
wine, watch an action movie, and

13:38.583 --> 13:41.384
rosterbate to my lineup till the
sky rains yogurt.

13:41.386 --> 13:46.222
Peaces. Ruxin, you forgot to clock out.
Ugh, he's the worst, and I'm

13:46.224 --> 13:48.591
pretty sure he's stealing some
of my stolen stuff.

13:48.593 --> 13:51.060
Oh, he's gonna get it.

13:51.062 --> 13:55.131
Hey, I'm home.

13:55.133 --> 14:03.539
Happy sexiversary. Yeah, I know,
that-that's why I rushed home. Good.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.741
I'm glad you did.
Wow, you look amazing.

14:05.743 --> 14:07.410
Thank you.
Come here.

14:07.412 --> 14:10.880
Yeah.
Mmm.

14:10.882 --> 14:13.149
Let's go upstairs.
Mmm, let's do it here.

14:13.151 --> 14:16.419
Okay, yeah, let's do it here.
Yeah.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.088
Your team name, by the way, it's
so lame.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.924
Well, you never know.
I could be too hot to handle.

14:21.926 --> 14:24.860
Really?
Okay, let's just...

14:27.433 --> 14:29.158
Mommy, I'm hungry.

14:29.398 --> 14:30.397
I want food.

14:30.399 --> 14:31.298
Just a minute, honey.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.132
It's coming, okay?

14:32.134 --> 14:32.966
It's almost ready.

14:32.968 --> 14:34.735
It is an unseasonably warm
autumn day here in Chicago...

14:34.737 --> 14:37.204
I got your macaroni and cheese,
hot dogs-- no ketchup,

14:37.206 --> 14:40.407
just like you like it-- and I got a
couple apple slices for you, too.

14:40.409 --> 14:44.912
Whether they are boating or playing sports...
You like that, huh?

14:44.914 --> 14:46.647
Yeah.

14:46.649 --> 14:47.881
It's almost ready, I promise.

14:47.883 --> 14:49.116
Who can say I blame 'em?

14:49.118 --> 14:52.452
This could be the last warm
weekday we get until next spring.

14:52.454 --> 14:53.587
Back to you, Bob.

14:53.589 --> 14:57.457
It's gonna be a hot one today.

14:57.459 --> 15:00.093
There she is.

15:00.095 --> 15:03.163
My little sexy dynamo.
Mmm.

15:03.165 --> 15:06.667
How are you doing?
Uh, I honestly am in a lot of

15:06.669 --> 15:08.669
pain.
Bam! You're welcome.

15:08.671 --> 15:10.771
I call that move "the kidney
shifter."

15:10.773 --> 15:14.141
Mmm, no, things are just not
good down south.

15:14.143 --> 15:18.111
It's like <i>Mississippi Burning.</i>
<i>I never saw that movie.</i>

15:18.113 --> 15:21.448
<i>Well, it's not a comedy.</i>
<i>Is there anything I need to know</i>

15:21.450 --> 15:24.484
<i>about?</i>
<i>Has your... been cleared to</i>

15:24.486 --> 15:27.154
<i>play?</i>
<i>Wha-- uh, no, I don't have</i>

15:27.156 --> 15:29.423
<i>anything.</i>
<i>Well, I don't have anything,</i>

15:29.425 --> 15:31.358
<i>either, but something set fire</i>
<i>to these crosses.</i>

15:31.360 --> 15:33.293
<i>Uh, I don't know what to tell</i>
<i>you, sweetheart.</i>

15:33.295 --> 15:35.028
<i>How about tell me the truth?</i>
<i>Fine. You want the truth?</i>

15:35.030 --> 15:36.964
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Uh, okay, I have been using</i>

15:36.966 --> 15:38.865
<i>your toothbrush for the last</i>
<i>three weeks 'cause I can't find</i>

15:38.867 --> 15:40.934
<i>mine, and I left CB at a grocery</i>
<i>store once. There.</i>

15:40.936 --> 15:42.836
<i>Me, too.</i>
<i>But I am as clean as a</i>

15:42.838 --> 15:44.771
<i>mountain stream.</i>
<i>I am as pure as the driven</i>

15:44.773 --> 15:46.606
<i>snow.</i>
<i>I'm spotless.</i>

15:46.608 --> 15:48.608
<i>Impeccable.</i>
<i>Unsoiled.</i>

15:48.610 --> 15:50.544
<i>Unsullied.</i>
<i>Unstained, and I'll piss in</i>

15:50.546 --> 15:52.646
<i>every glass that we own to prove</i>
<i>it.</i>

15:52.648 --> 15:54.381
<i>This isn't a lab, Kevin.</i>
<i>That's just ruining our</i>

15:54.383 --> 15:57.017
<i>glassware.</i>
<i>Will you just get your equipmunk</i>

15:57.019 --> 15:59.786
<i>checked?</i>
<i>Don't start equipmunk stuff.</i>

15:59.788 --> 16:01.621
<i>Jenny, don't do that.</i>

16:01.623 --> 16:04.791
<i>Equipmunk wrong.</i>
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

16:04.793 --> 16:07.361
<i>Equipmunk dirty!</i>
<i>Stop it.</i>

16:07.363 --> 16:10.497
<i>Equipmunk make my downstairs</i>
<i>hurty.</i>

16:10.499 --> 16:12.466
<i>She's saying I gave her an STD.</i>

16:12.468 --> 16:14.468
<i>I mean, I couldn't possibly give</i>
<i>her something if I don't have</i>

16:14.470 --> 16:16.136
<i>it, right?</i>
<i>Well, maybe you did.</i>

16:16.138 --> 16:18.305
<i>Have you had unprotected sex</i>
<i>with a stranger-- a woman or a</i>

16:18.307 --> 16:20.307
<i>man?</i>
<i>No.</i>

16:20.309 --> 16:22.209
<i>A prostitute?</i>
<i>Okay, look, do you have any open</i>

16:22.211 --> 16:24.044
<i>sores or lesions on your penis?</i>
<i>Why don't we ask patient</i>

16:24.046 --> 16:25.879
<i>zero?</i>
<i>Shut up.</i>

16:25.881 --> 16:27.881
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Cheeseburger!</i>

16:27.883 --> 16:29.883
<i>Ow!</i>
<i>What?</i>

16:29.885 --> 16:31.818
<i>Ow, I got the wing sauce in</i>
<i>my eye.</i>

16:31.820 --> 16:33.653
<i>Wait, wait a second.</i>

16:33.655 --> 16:35.489
<i>It burns, right?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

16:35.491 --> 16:37.324
<i>And you were eating here</i>
<i>before your sexiversary, right?</i>

16:37.326 --> 16:40.927
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Did you wash your hands?</i>

16:40.929 --> 16:42.929
<i>Oh, you pig!</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

16:42.931 --> 16:45.365
<i>I didn't have a chance.</i>
<i>She was on top of me as soon as</i>

16:45.367 --> 16:47.200
<i>I walked in the door.</i>

16:47.202 --> 16:49.703
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and</i>
<i>Mrs. Firecrotch.</i>

16:49.705 --> 16:51.772
<i>You are too hot to handle.</i>
<i>No, stop.</i>

16:51.774 --> 16:53.540
<i>Best team name ever.</i>
<i>How could we have ever doubted</i>

16:53.542 --> 16:55.542
<i>you?</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

16:55.544 --> 16:57.277
<i>Nobody</i> is ever gonna tell
Jenny about this.

16:57.279 --> 16:59.079
We could at least tell her
what to do.

16:59.081 --> 17:02.215
Get a celery swab, get some blue
cheese, and stick it right in

17:02.217 --> 17:04.084
that muffalo sauce.

17:04.086 --> 17:06.086
Whoa, Jesus!
Oh, Jesus. Taco.

17:06.088 --> 17:08.088
Jesus. Ooh.
Oh, Taco.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.257
Oh, my God.
Taco!

17:10.259 --> 17:14.694
There we go. Today's special: mesquite burgers.

17:14.695 --> 17:18.298
Shh, shh.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.733
Okay, I think we're good.
Are we <i>good</i> good?

17:20.736 --> 17:26.205
Stop with the good, good.
Jesus, come on.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.608
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
We put it inside the fireplace,

17:28.610 --> 17:31.044
okay, 'cause if we can't get
this thing <i>on</i> the mantel, we'll

17:31.046 --> 17:33.413
have it <i>in</i> the mantel.

17:33.415 --> 17:35.816
Okay. Oh, oh, oh.
Shh!

17:35.818 --> 17:38.151
Go, go, go!

17:38.153 --> 17:41.621
Oh, my God, no, what is that?

17:41.623 --> 17:43.623
What are you guys doing here?
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

17:43.625 --> 17:45.826
What's <i>that</i> doing here?
It lives here.

17:45.828 --> 17:50.130
I do, too. Yeah, but you're on a bye week.
So? I had to come home.

17:50.132 --> 17:52.299
Why?
Taco's got no shampoo, and I

17:52.301 --> 17:54.301
wanted to pick up my box set
of <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

17:54.303 --> 17:56.236
<i>I never knew what happened.</i>
<i>I keep lying about it.</i>

17:56.238 --> 17:58.305
<i>I just say that, "Oh ,the guy</i>
from <i>Malcolm in the Middle's</i> a

17:58.307 --> 18:00.507
bad guy."
Well, he starts nice.

18:00.509 --> 18:02.275
He does become bad.
Oh, spoiler alert!

18:02.277 --> 18:04.010
We had a 45-minute
conversation about it.

18:04.012 --> 18:05.846
No, you had a 45-minute
conversation.

18:05.848 --> 18:07.914
I zoned out and pretended to
<i>play Tetris</i> in my head.

18:07.916 --> 18:10.283
Hello? Hello?
Shit!

18:10.285 --> 18:13.854
Shit!
Hello?

18:13.856 --> 18:25.599
Oh, God.

18:25.601 --> 18:30.604
Geoffrey got this one, too?
Oh, disgusting.

18:30.606 --> 18:34.141
Nothing.
Nothing's happening.

18:34.143 --> 18:39.479
Oh, I need some tea.

18:39.481 --> 18:56.029
Get that back.
Get that back.

18:56.031 --> 19:00.300
No. God!

19:00.302 --> 19:02.669
Hey, babe.
Hey.

19:02.671 --> 19:04.871
Ooh, spicy!
Mmm, I know.

19:04.873 --> 19:06.873
It's burning my mouth.
Hey, the doctor called.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.075
I'm clean as a whistle.
I am medically cleared to play.

19:09.077 --> 19:11.511
See? Who knows what that was?
Forget about that.

19:11.513 --> 19:13.513
I mean, what the heck?
All right, everyone, there's

19:13.515 --> 19:15.916
a new menu.
It says "Taco's Truck, No

19:15.918 --> 19:18.318
Tacos."
You have any questions, ask me,

19:18.320 --> 19:20.720
Taco.
Also, Taco's special today is

19:20.722 --> 19:22.923
the wings.
They come in three flavors:

19:22.925 --> 19:25.325
mild, spicy and
too hot to handle.

19:25.327 --> 19:27.327
No, no, no, no! Taco!
Be careful with those.

19:27.329 --> 19:29.529
They are dangerously hot.
Taco!

19:29.531 --> 19:34.501
Oh, T... Your dickis clean, but your
fingers are filthy.

19:34.503 --> 19:38.104
You went all up in my biz, you
burnt down Mississippi!

19:38.106 --> 19:40.507
That hot sauce is so hot, it
made me think I had something

19:40.509 --> 19:42.876
worse than the clap!
Oh, that's disgusting.

19:42.878 --> 19:45.278
No, no, no.
Gross.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.681
The clap's not that bad.
It's very treatable.

19:47.683 --> 19:50.083
Just, come on, it's like a "B"
rating.

19:50.085 --> 19:52.452
We're leaving.
Just don't touch your vagina

19:52.454 --> 19:54.888
after you eat the wings.
It's not that complicated.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.286
Oh.
Wait... sir.

19:56.406 --> 20:02.195
Let's get out of here.
This is not good for business, you shit-pig.

20:04.822 --> 20:07.604
- Honey, I'm home.
- Hi!

20:07.997 --> 20:09.629
- Missed me?
- Yes.

20:10.022 --> 20:13.439
- How are you?
- Oh, God, I missed you so much.

20:13.559 --> 20:15.011
Yeah, missed you too.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.274
This place isn't the same without you.

20:17.727 --> 20:18.937
Yeah.

20:19.057 --> 20:21.960
- Muah. Can we have sex?
-Yeah. But first,

20:22.398 --> 20:23.948
I want to see my son.

20:24.068 --> 20:26.354
- You're a great dad.
- You're a great wife.

20:26.474 --> 20:28.552
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.

20:31.737 --> 20:33.879
Oh.
Oh, my God.

20:33.999 --> 20:38.079
Pete! Why is our son holding a
statue of Joe Paterno? Sacko.

20:38.388 --> 20:42.967
Oh, baby Geoffrey. Sleeping so close
to that scrotum, forever unclean.

20:43.277 --> 20:53.573
