11:39.900 --> 11:41.831
down the left side

11:41.832 --> 11:44.174
to just above the
pubic symphysis.

11:45.806 --> 11:50.079
Note... presence of
placental parenchyma.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.781
This girl was pregnant?

11:51.782 --> 11:54.483
That cut is a crude c-section,

11:54.484 --> 11:57.046
and from the lack
of tissue reaction,

11:57.047 --> 11:58.387
I'd say it's postmortem.

11:58.388 --> 12:01.420
Okay, so someone shot
her, waited for her to die,

12:01.421 --> 12:04.253
cut the baby out. Could
this baby still be alive?

12:04.254 --> 12:06.355
I'll have Ethan
check the hospitals.

12:06.356 --> 12:08.858
There's a small window of
time once the mother is dead

12:08.859 --> 12:11.060
that the baby can
survive in utero.

12:11.061 --> 12:13.002
The baby's father
could be the killer.

12:13.003 --> 12:15.134
Tried to hide his identity
by killing his own child.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.966
No baby, no d.N.A.
Evidence it's his.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.908
Too bad he's dead wrong.

12:18.909 --> 12:21.210
The father of the
baby is our killer?

12:21.211 --> 12:23.472
I know how to I.D. Him.

12:23.473 --> 12:25.444
You want to do what now?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.417
Get the d.N.A. From
the chorionic villi.

12:28.418 --> 12:31.380
It's fetal in origin. It's like
having the baby right here.

12:31.381 --> 12:34.083
Then we just match
it to the father's d.N.A.

12:34.084 --> 12:35.384
If this fool is crazy
enough to kill a girl

12:35.385 --> 12:37.356
and cut her baby out,

12:37.357 --> 12:39.328
you know this isn't his
first time at the show.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.290
He'll be in codis.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.332
What's Ethan doing?

12:43.333 --> 12:46.435
Attempting to unravel
the mystery that is oksana

12:46.436 --> 12:48.367
via her stomach contents.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.240
As far as last meals go,
it's... it's a weird one...

12:51.241 --> 12:54.273
Black caviar and French fries.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.504
Weird and good.

12:55.505 --> 12:57.346
(Imitates Russian accent)
Maybe Sergei can come,

12:57.347 --> 12:59.478
interpret this for us as well.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.811
(Chuckles)

13:01.812 --> 13:04.183
Well, there is not much here.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.916
It's a rough translation.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.219
(Laughs)

13:10.220 --> 13:11.520
I have often found

13:11.521 --> 13:14.193
that people who work in
close proximity to death,

13:14.194 --> 13:17.868
they have a more
passionate take on life.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.371
You are dangerous.

13:22.372 --> 13:23.502
(Clears throat)

13:23.503 --> 13:25.074
No. No. No. I am honest.

13:25.075 --> 13:26.936
I know time is short,

13:26.937 --> 13:29.538
and when something
extraordinary crosses your path,

13:29.539 --> 13:33.382
you must drink deep
and enjoy the taste.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.044
(Door opens)

13:35.045 --> 13:37.486
Oh. I'm sorry. Are we
interrupting? (Clears throat)

13:37.487 --> 13:39.418
We have something
for you. What's up?

13:39.419 --> 13:40.489
Got a match on
the baby's father...

13:40.490 --> 13:42.321
Arco starkovich,
Ukrainian-American.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.353
Big in import-export business.

13:44.354 --> 13:45.824
Tommy and I are heading
over there right now.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.827
I don't suppose you'd
want to go with us?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.160
Keep me from saying
anything inappropriate?

13:51.161 --> 13:52.531
Nope. Thanks. No? Sure?

13:52.532 --> 13:54.533
Let me know what you
find out. Better yet, text me.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.106
Okay? Bye. (Curtis
speaks indistinctly)

13:57.107 --> 13:58.567
(Chuckles)

13:58.568 --> 14:00.269
Let's get out of here.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.311
(Dog barking in distance)

14:02.312 --> 14:04.473
Arco starkovich, a
moment of your time, please.

14:04.474 --> 14:07.546
Camille, take mama to the car.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.418
What is this all about, arco?

14:09.419 --> 14:15.254
It's okay, mama. Everything
is fine. Go to the car.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.327
My wife and I were just going to
celebrate my mother's birthday.

14:18.328 --> 14:19.488
What's this about?

14:19.489 --> 14:21.430
Your dead teenage girlfriend.

14:21.431 --> 14:23.963
Look, she's not my girlfriend.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.435
I met her at a club
about a year ago. Okay?

14:26.436 --> 14:27.566
What club?

14:27.567 --> 14:28.398
Club tatyana.

14:28.399 --> 14:30.169
Tatyana?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.971
Tatyana caters to men
from the Czech Republic.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.403
How'd you meet a
Ukrainian call girl there?

14:34.404 --> 14:36.505
I was surprised to
hear a Ukrainian accent.

14:36.506 --> 14:37.576
We started to talk.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.608
I didn't know she
was a prostitute.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.580
I think you did more than talk.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.153
She was pregnant
with your child.

14:44.154 --> 14:45.554
I don't know
anything about that.

14:45.555 --> 14:48.017
I, uh, broke up with her
six, seven months ago.

14:48.018 --> 14:49.959
Or maybe you did it
last night, the hard way.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.222
Last night? No, it wasn't me.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.224
I have an alibi, witnesses,

14:55.225 --> 14:56.465
the mayor of Philadelphia.

14:56.466 --> 15:00.069
Oh! You were at the trade gala.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.401
Yes. I, my wife, my mother...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.974
We sat right next to the mayor.

15:04.975 --> 15:08.077
I made sure to stick with
him all night for publicity.

15:08.078 --> 15:09.338
(Camera shutter clicks)

15:09.339 --> 15:11.080
What was that for?

15:11.081 --> 15:12.611
You want publicity?
You're gonna get publicity.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.613
That's it. You can go.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.287
Tell mom I said happy birthday.

15:19.349 --> 15:20.419
Did you buy that?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.491
Kate was at that gala, too.

15:22.492 --> 15:23.652
I'm sending her arco's picture,

15:23.653 --> 15:26.495
asking her to check
with her p.R. Contacts,

15:26.496 --> 15:28.327
confirm his alibi.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.429
Since when are you so big on
keeping your boss in the loop?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.062
Since I realized it was
bugging the crap out of her.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.433
Where to next?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.565
Well, starkovich said that
he met oksana at club tatyana.

15:36.566 --> 15:38.407
I know tatyana. Really?

15:38.408 --> 15:41.210
Yeah. Let's see if we can get
a line on who her pimp was.

15:41.211 --> 15:42.571
(Cell phone alert chimes)

15:42.572 --> 15:43.943
Mm.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.615
Hmm.

15:46.616 --> 15:48.577
The girl was
pregnant by this man?

15:48.578 --> 15:49.519
Yeah.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.581
Starkovich. Who is he?

15:52.582 --> 15:54.583
Some rich, well-connected
businessman

15:54.584 --> 15:57.526
who thinks he can
get away with it.

15:57.527 --> 16:00.129
The rich always get
away with it, Katya,

16:00.130 --> 16:02.561
unless someone richer
doesn't wish them to.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.732
Mm-hmm.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.734
Mm.

16:05.735 --> 16:09.568
So your people... they
think that this starkovich

16:09.569 --> 16:11.170
killed the girl?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.741
Yeah, I shouldn't really
talk about anything more.

16:12.742 --> 16:15.544
It's still an open case.

16:15.545 --> 16:16.645
(Laughs)

16:16.646 --> 16:18.277
That's fine with me.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.349
The last thing I wish
to do is talk about work.

16:20.350 --> 16:21.450
(Laughs)

16:21.451 --> 16:22.511
Mm?

16:22.512 --> 16:23.582
(Cell phone buzzes)

16:23.583 --> 16:24.983
(Laughs)

16:24.984 --> 16:26.285
Wish denied. (Clears throat)

16:26.286 --> 16:32.591
(Buzz)

16:32.592 --> 16:35.595
(Speaking Ukrainian)

16:40.730 --> 16:42.171
Da. Spasibo.

16:42.172 --> 16:45.504
Spasibo.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.407
Who was that?

16:50.140 --> 16:53.482
The job. Sadly, I
must be the one to...

16:53.483 --> 16:55.614
Cut this evening short.

16:55.615 --> 17:00.489
(Electronic music playing)

17:00.490 --> 17:02.491
Adam!

17:02.492 --> 17:04.653
You brought me a present.

17:04.654 --> 17:06.525
Tatyana, this is Megan.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.298
Megan, tatyana.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.161
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.463
Hi. I'm Tommy.

17:14.464 --> 17:18.407
Uh, we were
hoping we could talk.

17:18.408 --> 17:19.809
With pleasure.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.521
Does this girl look
familiar to you?

17:34.084 --> 17:37.786
I've never seen this girl,
but this Mark I have seen.

17:37.787 --> 17:40.389
I hope I never see it again.

17:40.390 --> 17:43.692
I don't know who's behind
it, and I don't want to.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.195
My girls...

17:46.196 --> 17:47.296
They have good life.

17:47.297 --> 17:48.697
They make good money.

17:48.698 --> 17:50.599
Legal money.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.501
They get nice
clothes, apartment.

17:52.502 --> 17:54.843
They meet a nice guy,
maybe they get more.

17:54.844 --> 17:57.776
But these Ukrainian girls...

17:57.777 --> 17:59.778
The branded ones...

17:59.779 --> 18:01.410
Are stolen girls.

18:01.411 --> 18:03.412
What do you mean "stolen"?

18:03.413 --> 18:05.514
Girls who get snatched
from some village

18:05.515 --> 18:08.357
on the other side of the
world and dragged here.

18:08.358 --> 18:11.320
They are kept
sometimes in cages.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.292
So we're not talking
about prostitution.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.264
This is sex trafficking.
Yes. They suffer

18:15.265 --> 18:16.595
in ways you have never heard of,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.867
then thrown away
if cause trouble.

18:18.868 --> 18:20.769
Trouble like getting pregnant?

18:20.770 --> 18:22.100
How much?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.202
About eight and a half months.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.573
Hmm.

18:24.574 --> 18:27.206
No one will let girl get that
pregnant in this business.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.507
I'll ask around.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.480
If any of my girls seen
your girl, I call you, yes?

18:31.481 --> 18:32.741
Uh, one thing.

18:32.742 --> 18:37.416
Her final meal was black
caviar and French fries.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.617
Any ideas?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.589
Borscht Bob's
over in east Philly.

18:40.590 --> 18:44.493
He calls that meal the
sacred and the profane.

18:44.494 --> 18:46.295
(Chuckles)

18:46.296 --> 18:50.729
Next time, come back
without your friends.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.563

(Ring)

18:58.638 --> 19:00.409
(Megan) Hello?

19:00.410 --> 19:03.472
Looks like we won't be accusing
arco starkovich of murder.

19:03.473 --> 19:05.143
If these photos are
anything to go by,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.845
it looks like he's the
mayor's new best friend.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.747
Well, could he have
slipped out, killed oksana,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.519
and then rejoined the party?

19:10.520 --> 19:11.780
Mm, be cutting it pretty close.

19:11.781 --> 19:13.352
The killer would
be covered in blood.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.254
This guy doesn't have
a hair out of place.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.386
It's fine. I already
have a new theory.

19:17.387 --> 19:19.828
Unfortunately, these
girls are disposable.

19:19.829 --> 19:22.231
What if a client, say arco,

19:22.232 --> 19:24.493
complains about a
girl, and the handler

19:24.494 --> 19:28.497
hires somebody to
get rid of the problem?

19:28.498 --> 19:30.899
Kate? Hello?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.542
Yeah, um, yeah, I heard you.

19:33.543 --> 19:36.174
You know what? It's... it's late.
I'll talk to you in the morning.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.377
(Hangs up receiver)

19:44.714 --> 19:46.256
(Knock on door)

19:47.387 --> 19:49.918
(Knock)

19:49.919 --> 19:52.861
Hi. I've been trying
to call you all morning.

19:52.862 --> 19:54.863
I was working late.

19:54.864 --> 19:55.964
Hmm. (Door closes)

19:55.965 --> 19:58.397
And exactly who is
it that you work for?

19:58.398 --> 19:59.728
(Cell phone rings)

19:59.729 --> 20:01.400
I don't want to lie to you.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.871
You already did.

20:02.872 --> 20:06.705
(Ring)

20:06.706 --> 20:08.437
Do you want to get that?

20:08.438 --> 20:09.878
It might be your
buddy arco starkovich.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.610
What exactly am I
being accused of?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.782
The man in this picture... the one
that you pretended not to know...

20:13.783 --> 20:17.346
Is connected to the girl that
you stood over in my morgue,

20:17.347 --> 20:19.648
the girl who's 16
and a sex slave

20:19.649 --> 20:21.590
and pregnant and dead.

20:21.591 --> 20:23.452
So I wanted to give
you a chance to explain

20:23.453 --> 20:24.793
before I bring in the cops.

20:24.794 --> 20:26.555
I can't tell you who I
work for. This is private.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.727
But this man...

20:28.728 --> 20:31.800
I met this man first time at
the gala. I don't know him.

20:31.801 --> 20:33.962
Hmm. Look pretty friendly
for somebody you just met.

20:33.963 --> 20:36.335
If someone had taken a
photo of us the same night,

20:36.336 --> 20:38.407
they could say the same
thing. Not good enough.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.809
(Groans)

20:40.810 --> 20:42.671
I'm not lying to you.

20:42.672 --> 20:45.243
In Ukraine, every other man,

20:45.244 --> 20:46.915
after two drinks, wants
to be your best friend.

20:46.916 --> 20:51.350
Why do you think I was hiding in
the back room when you met me?

20:51.351 --> 20:54.523
Okay. If you must go to
the authorities, I understand,

20:54.524 --> 20:56.655
but please, let me take shower.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.458
Let me take you to lunch.
I will tell you all about

20:59.459 --> 21:04.493
my 5-minute conversation
with arco starkovich.

21:04.494 --> 21:05.695
Please.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.041
Three hospitals had
babies dropped off

21:13.042 --> 21:14.743
on their doorsteps last night.

21:14.744 --> 21:16.805
None of their d.N.A.
Matches oksana's.

21:16.806 --> 21:19.478
She's a baby herself.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.649
Yeah. She's barely
older than Lacey.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.811
She had to hide a
letter to her mother

21:22.812 --> 21:24.583
in the hem of her nightgown.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.485
Her mother doesn't
even know she's dead.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.487
No luck in finding the parents?

21:28.488 --> 21:29.588
No.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.589
So I was looking at the receipts

21:30.590 --> 21:31.890
for borscht Bob last night,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.022
and only one person ordered
the sacred and profane.

21:34.023 --> 21:35.364
It was an address
about a block away,

21:35.365 --> 21:36.765
so I thought I'd take a look.

21:36.766 --> 21:38.897
Now the place is a dump.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.068
It's the perfect place to hide

21:40.069 --> 21:42.571
if you're on the run
from your pimp/abductor.

21:42.572 --> 21:45.574
Now I thought it was
gonna be a rat's nest,

21:45.575 --> 21:46.835
but look at this.

21:46.836 --> 21:47.906
Looks more like a love nest.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.878
Yeah. That's what
I thought. But look.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.741
Triple look on the bedroom
door on the outside.

21:52.742 --> 21:55.884
There's no phone and the
windows were all nailed shut.

21:55.885 --> 21:57.716
It's not a love
nest. It's a prison.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.749
Somebody was keeping
her inside, under lock and key.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.852
All right. Let's go find
out who's paying rent.

22:09.499 --> 22:11.860
(Shower running in
distance) (Telephone rings)

22:11.861 --> 22:19.861
(Ring)

22:21.411 --> 22:22.841
Hello?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.744
(Woman, Ukrainian accent)
Sorry. Wrong number.

22:25.745 --> 22:30.379
(Line disconnects)

22:30.380 --> 22:32.121
(Hangs up phone)

22:53.773 --> 22:55.405
(Gasps)

23:04.383 --> 23:07.085
Did I hear the phone ring?

23:07.086 --> 23:09.888
Uh, it... that was my
cell phone. It was work.

23:09.889 --> 23:10.960
I have to go.

23:12.722 --> 23:14.022
Are you okay?

23:14.023 --> 23:16.495
I'm fine.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.527
Are we okay?

23:18.528 --> 23:20.098
We're fine. I'll call you later.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.870
Katya.

23:21.871 --> 23:24.403
(Door opens and closes)

23:36.986 --> 23:39.818
(Cell phone rings)

23:39.819 --> 23:42.120
(Ring)

23:42.121 --> 23:43.892
Megan hunt.

23:43.893 --> 23:46.895
It's tatyana.

23:46.896 --> 23:49.858
I talked to some of my girls,
and they have information.

23:49.859 --> 23:51.560
If you want to hear it,

23:51.561 --> 23:52.931
come alone.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.103
(Line disconnects)

24:25.595 --> 24:29.067
♪♪♪

24:29.068 --> 24:31.500
Now tell her what you told me.

24:31.501 --> 24:33.041
(Czech accent) A
man come to club,

24:33.042 --> 24:37.075
uh, two weeks ago asking
for girl with this Mark.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.178
We ask him how many
girl he want with that Mark.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.010
We know at least, uh, two.

24:42.011 --> 24:44.082
Was one of these girls oksana?

24:44.083 --> 24:46.715
(Czech accent) No, we
do not know this oksana.

24:46.716 --> 24:48.256
Two different girls with Mark.

24:48.257 --> 24:50.589
Mystery man says if we
see any girl with Mark,

24:50.590 --> 24:51.920
give them his number.

24:51.921 --> 24:53.862
When I see marked
girls two day later,

24:53.863 --> 24:55.924
I say, "there is handsome
man looking for you.

24:55.925 --> 24:58.226
Will pay good money
if you contact him."

24:58.227 --> 25:00.929
Then I gave them
one of his cards.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.872
This is his card?

25:04.103 --> 25:05.734
And they called that number?

25:05.735 --> 25:07.005
Yes.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.777
Then I never saw them again.

25:08.778 --> 25:12.211
Neither of them?

25:13.713 --> 25:14.843
Can you describe this man?

25:14.844 --> 25:17.846
Very handsome, tall,

25:17.847 --> 25:19.187
Russian.

25:19.188 --> 25:20.949
No Ukrainian.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.792
Um, with a small
scar right here.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.660
(Whirring)

25:32.832 --> 25:34.003
(Beep)

25:37.306 --> 25:39.537
(Knock on door)

25:39.538 --> 25:42.270
What are you doing here?

25:42.271 --> 25:48.718
Looking for you.

25:49.779 --> 25:50.979
How did you get past
the security guard?

25:50.980 --> 25:52.921
I did not see one.

25:52.922 --> 25:57.026
Looks like it is
just the two of us.

25:58.888 --> 26:00.729
You look nervous.

26:00.730 --> 26:04.092
Mm. Just a long day.

26:04.093 --> 26:05.563
I bet.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.935
So what are you doing here?

26:06.936 --> 26:08.336
I leave tomorrow.

26:08.337 --> 26:10.740
I would like to
ask you to dinner.

26:12.802 --> 26:15.343
I would have
called first, but...

26:15.344 --> 26:18.677
You dropped this
in my hotel room.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.879
Hey, buddy.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.081
You didn't sign in.

26:23.212 --> 26:26.354
He okay, Dr. Murphy?

26:26.355 --> 26:28.256
Yeah.

26:28.257 --> 26:31.290
Yeah, he's fine. Thank you.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.996
You know what? Um...

26:37.997 --> 26:40.729
Why don't I meet
you back at the hotel?

26:40.730 --> 26:42.100
Give me an hour or so.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.172
I have some things
to finish up here.

26:44.173 --> 26:45.875
I'll see you in an hour.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.914
(Cell phone rings)

26:55.915 --> 26:57.986
(Ring, beep)

26:57.987 --> 26:59.287
Oh, my god.

26:59.288 --> 27:01.119
Megan, I've never been
so happy to hear your voice.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.823
According to tatyana,
Sergei's been here two weeks.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.394
Looking for oksana.

27:06.395 --> 27:07.796
Yep.

27:07.797 --> 27:10.258
He found her the
night of the gala.

27:10.259 --> 27:14.202
And killed her after
spending the night with me.

27:14.203 --> 27:16.004
(Scoffs)

27:16.005 --> 27:17.405
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?

27:17.406 --> 27:20.909
You know, I haven't even
gone near a man in months,

27:20.910 --> 27:25.113
and the first guy I like
turns out to be a murderer.

27:25.114 --> 27:27.776
Maybe multiple murderer. What?

27:27.777 --> 27:30.118
Sorry. Tatyana said that two
other girls with the same Mark

27:30.119 --> 27:32.350
have gone missing
in the last two weeks.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.822
They haven't turned up
here. No, they wouldn't.

27:33.823 --> 27:34.983
Apparently, these
people Bury their secrets

27:34.984 --> 27:36.685
and Bury them deep.

27:36.686 --> 27:39.958
And if Sergei's the enforcer
for these sex traffickers,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.659
then...

27:41.660 --> 27:42.731
Yeah.

27:42.732 --> 27:45.964
(Exhales deeply)

27:45.965 --> 27:47.265
What am I gonna do?

27:47.266 --> 27:50.699
Okay, I'm flattered
that I'm your go-to guy

27:50.700 --> 27:52.741
for off-the-book advice,
but do you realize

27:52.742 --> 27:56.074
you completely screwed us
on a key piece of evidence?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.075
So much for a sympathetic ear.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.107
Megan, she went
to the guy's room,

27:59.108 --> 28:00.278
took the shirt
without a warrant.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.379
It's completely inadmissible.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.051
So she wasn't thinking clearly.

28:03.052 --> 28:05.053
Her job is to think clearly.

28:05.054 --> 28:07.716
Look, she should've
come to us first.

28:07.717 --> 28:10.218
This is a piece of evidence
we could've nailed this guy with,

28:10.219 --> 28:12.121
and now it's off the table.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.163
What if I just put it back?

28:15.164 --> 28:17.165
What?

28:17.166 --> 28:21.300
What if I put the shirt back?

28:25.234 --> 28:26.875
It's not a bad idea.

28:26.876 --> 28:29.037
I get a warrant. I
call it in right now.

28:29.038 --> 28:32.040
Meanwhile, you go back to
your room, you put the shirt back

28:32.041 --> 28:33.742
exactly where you
found it, then you leave.

28:33.743 --> 28:37.115
We bust in, we collect
the evidence legitimately,

28:37.116 --> 28:38.917
Boris the butcher goes to jail.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.389
What if the maniac already
knows his shirt's gone?

28:41.390 --> 28:42.991
I told Kate to come
to you for help,

28:42.992 --> 28:46.124
not help in getting
killed. No. No.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.256
You do not do this. Mnh-mnh. No.

28:48.257 --> 28:51.099
(Tommy) With this Mike, I'll
be able to hear everything,

28:51.100 --> 28:53.802
so all you have to
do is go to his room,

28:53.803 --> 28:55.303
put the shirt back,

28:55.304 --> 28:57.735
and get the hell
out. You got it?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.138
Now if anything goes wrong,
the code is "it's getting late."

29:00.139 --> 29:01.339
You say that, I come running.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.071
You're not alone. I'm
only two doors down.

29:03.072 --> 29:04.173
The warrant's on the way.

29:05.274 --> 29:07.976
Keep this in your purse.

29:07.977 --> 29:09.878
You don't have to do this.

29:09.879 --> 29:12.321
Yes, I do.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.988
I'm heading up to his room now.

29:19.989 --> 29:21.290
(Clears throat)

29:23.132 --> 29:24.132
Katya.

29:26.996 --> 29:29.497
(Under breath) Damn it. He's
in the lobby. What do I do?

29:29.498 --> 29:30.799
(Normal voice) Hi.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.771
I thought I was
meeting you upstairs.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.444
I know what hard time we
will have leaving the room.

29:36.445 --> 29:41.850
So perhaps we
should have dinner first.

29:41.851 --> 29:43.051
Hmm?

29:43.052 --> 29:44.983
I'd rather have room service.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.856
This sounds like a good idea.

29:47.857 --> 29:50.018
(Laughs)

29:50.019 --> 29:51.189
You look beautiful.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.361
Thank you.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.793
Why don't you see

29:55.794 --> 29:57.927
if they can track down a
bottle of that honey vodka?

29:59.298 --> 30:01.831
I will see if they have it.

30:09.038 --> 30:12.480
Hello. This is room 5-4-9.

30:12.481 --> 30:16.115
Yes, I would like...
(Speaks indistinctly)

30:22.451 --> 30:26.125
Is there something else
of mine you'd like to steal?

30:27.426 --> 30:29.157
Hmm?

30:29.158 --> 30:30.959
It's getting late.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.960
What?

30:31.961 --> 30:34.063
It's getting late.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.276
As soon as he saw the wire,

30:48.277 --> 30:50.949
he grabbed his keys
and a gun and took off.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.252
Adam, he's on the run. Have
them lock the hotel down.

30:54.223 --> 30:55.954
You okay?

30:55.955 --> 30:57.125
Yeah.

30:57.126 --> 30:59.227
God, I'm such an idiot.

30:59.228 --> 31:01.159
Don't be so hard on yourself.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.490
You put the shirt back.
We can use it as evidence.

31:02.491 --> 31:04.632
They're shutting down the
hotel. Looks like he's gone.

31:04.633 --> 31:06.235
You okay?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.470
Whoa. Whoa. I
got something here.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.042
This guy's definitely a hit man.

31:14.043 --> 31:15.573
This is a dossier on oksana.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.874
This look like a
flight number to you?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.446
Uh, let me check.

31:18.447 --> 31:22.650
Are there any other victims
mentioned in there? None that I can see.

31:22.651 --> 31:26.284
Uh-huh. There's an air
Ukraine flight nonstop to Kiev.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.587
Departs Philly
international in two hours.

31:29.959 --> 31:32.221
Go. I'm fine. Go.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.127
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.130
So nobody by the
name of Sergei damanov

31:42.131 --> 31:43.501
has checked in yet.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.233
(Static hisses) (Man)
Suspect spotted at arrivals,

31:45.234 --> 31:46.374
not departures.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.436
Okay. Copy.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.342
Sergei damanov. Freeze!

31:54.343 --> 31:55.343
(Crowd screams)

31:55.344 --> 31:58.016
Turn around.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.049
Slowly.

32:01.050 --> 32:04.352
(Grunts)

32:04.353 --> 32:08.026
(Adam) Drop it, Sergei!

32:08.027 --> 32:09.657
Drop the gun! Put it down!

32:09.658 --> 32:12.200
Put it down on the ground.

32:12.201 --> 32:13.701
Sergei damanov,
you're under arrest

32:13.702 --> 32:17.365
for the murder of
oksana svetlova.

32:17.366 --> 32:21.509
Has he said anything since
they brought him in last night?

32:21.510 --> 32:24.512
So I did a little
checking up on you.

32:24.513 --> 32:26.214
It turns out you're a badass.

32:26.215 --> 32:28.216
Spetsnaz, Ukrainian
special forces,

32:28.217 --> 32:31.179
you fought with the
Russians in Afghanistan,

32:31.180 --> 32:33.281
against the
Russians in chechnya.

32:33.282 --> 32:35.953
In Croatia, you fought
against the Serbs. Now look,

32:35.954 --> 32:37.125
I'm not that good at geography,

32:37.126 --> 32:39.557
but what this
itinerary does tell me is

32:39.558 --> 32:41.589
that you like to
fight, you like to kill,

32:41.590 --> 32:43.331
and you like to get paid for it.

32:43.332 --> 32:44.732
But what I can't figure
out is how do you go

32:44.733 --> 32:47.265
from killing bad guys to
carving up a pregnant girl

32:47.266 --> 32:49.398
in a back alley?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.972
Maybe you wanna tell us
about the other missing girls?

32:54.973 --> 32:57.275
You know, the ones with
the bar code, like oksana's.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.248
Were you just passing the
time with a few recreational kills

33:00.249 --> 33:02.280
until you found the
girl you really wanted?

33:02.281 --> 33:05.113
Or did your employer
hire you to kill them, too?

33:05.114 --> 33:06.314
Yeah. That brings
up a good point.

33:06.315 --> 33:08.156
At the airport, you
were in arrivals,

33:08.157 --> 33:09.287
not departures.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.288
You were there to
meet your employer,

33:10.289 --> 33:11.489
weren't you?

33:11.490 --> 33:13.362
Uh, Kate, I wouldn't...

33:14.423 --> 33:16.064
(slams door)

33:16.065 --> 33:17.295
Yes, I would.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.167
You sliced up a pregnant girl

33:19.168 --> 33:21.199
and left her to
bleed out in an alley,

33:21.200 --> 33:23.171
and then you crawled
into bed with me.

33:23.172 --> 33:26.034
So I just have a few questions,
as you can probably imagine.

33:26.035 --> 33:27.475
Like what kind of person
could do something

33:27.476 --> 33:29.207
like that and why?

33:29.208 --> 33:30.638
Tell me the truth.

33:30.639 --> 33:34.212
Katya, I have told
you all I can tell you.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.584
(Scoffs)

33:36.585 --> 33:39.587
So why remove her baby
and just leave her there?

33:39.588 --> 33:41.689
What... what did
you do with the baby?

33:41.690 --> 33:44.152
Where are these
other missing girls?

33:44.153 --> 33:46.424
Mr. Damanov, you are free to go.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.197
Whoa. What? Hey.
You can't do that.

33:49.198 --> 33:50.198
There are six guys outside

33:50.199 --> 33:52.060
from the Ukrainian consulate.

33:52.061 --> 33:56.604
As a member of the consulate's
"technical adjunct staff,"

33:56.605 --> 33:58.706
Sergei has full
diplomatic immunity.

33:58.707 --> 34:00.508
His limo is waiting
for him downstairs

34:00.509 --> 34:01.810
to take him to the consulate.

34:03.212 --> 34:05.314
Speak to you in the hall?

34:11.280 --> 34:14.422
(Exhales deeply)

34:14.423 --> 34:15.583
What are you doing?

34:15.584 --> 34:17.555
No. What are you doing?

34:17.556 --> 34:20.388
What part about being
discreet didn't you get?

34:20.389 --> 34:23.060
The Ukrainian ambassador
calls the governor

34:23.061 --> 34:24.132
and then the governor calls me.

34:24.133 --> 34:26.234
That's how I find out.

34:26.235 --> 34:27.595
I meant to tell you.
Really? When?

34:27.596 --> 34:30.299
Before or after you
went to his hotel room?

34:31.440 --> 34:34.172
My god, I've endorsed you, Kate,

34:34.173 --> 34:36.304
which means we're
joined at the hip.

34:36.305 --> 34:39.147
We don't get to make
mistakes like this.

34:39.148 --> 34:42.581
In one fell swoop, you've
destroyed both of our careers.

34:48.287 --> 34:51.389
I did not mean
to hurt you, Katya,

34:51.390 --> 34:53.292
but the truth is
not mine to tell.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.831
Looks like your boyfriend
just got away with murder.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.341
None of this adds up.

35:13.342 --> 35:15.383
All right, if he's had immunity
all along, why did he run?

35:15.384 --> 35:16.814
Because the police
were chasing him?

35:16.815 --> 35:21.819
Or maybe he's not done with
whatever he came here to do.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.621
Wait.

35:23.622 --> 35:27.395
Look at these. Look what
they all have in common.

35:27.396 --> 35:28.896
A necklace.

35:28.897 --> 35:30.558
She's wearing it in every photo.

35:30.559 --> 35:32.301
It's like she never
took it off. Right.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.805
But she wasn't wearing
it when we found her.

35:37.806 --> 35:39.507
That abrasion on her neck.

35:39.508 --> 35:43.211
What do you bet the links on
this necklace match those marks?

35:43.212 --> 35:44.712
That the killer
snatched it off her neck?

35:44.713 --> 35:46.674
Yeah, we didn't find anything
like it in Sergei's things.

35:46.675 --> 35:49.277
Maybe he took it as a trophy
to give it to his employer.

35:49.278 --> 35:51.279
Proof that mission
was accomplished.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.880
We find this necklace,
maybe we can find out

35:52.881 --> 35:55.783
who hired the
international man of misery.

35:55.784 --> 35:58.726
I-I've seen this
necklace before.

35:58.727 --> 35:59.927
(Megan) Yeah.

35:59.928 --> 36:02.690
So have I.

36:02.691 --> 36:05.533
Where did you get that necklace?

36:05.534 --> 36:08.436
Dr. Murphy noticed
that you were wearing it

36:08.437 --> 36:10.468
the night of the trade gala,

36:10.469 --> 36:11.499
and I saw that
you were wearing it

36:11.500 --> 36:13.871
the day we came
to talk to your son.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.503
Did he give it to you?

36:15.504 --> 36:16.844
Why, yes.

36:16.845 --> 36:21.209
It was an early birthday
present from arco.

36:21.210 --> 36:22.580
Hmm.

36:22.581 --> 36:23.752
Why?

36:24.753 --> 36:27.615
So we finally found out

36:27.616 --> 36:30.258
who owned oksana's
love nest/prison.

36:30.259 --> 36:31.819
Stark star enterprises...

36:31.820 --> 36:34.922
It's a company owned by a
company that's owned by you.

36:34.923 --> 36:37.825
They also own some
warehouses down on the docks.

36:37.826 --> 36:41.800
Oh, you'll never guess what
we found inside warehouse 44.

36:47.536 --> 36:49.337
So...

36:49.338 --> 36:51.679
You didn't innocently meet
her in some club, did you?

36:51.680 --> 36:54.512
You put oksana to work.

36:54.513 --> 36:55.843
Only at first.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.245
Only at first, yeah?

36:57.246 --> 36:59.817
Then you started dipping
into the merchandise.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.849
Oksana got pregnant,
started making demands.

37:01.850 --> 37:03.821
Then what? You
had to get rid of her?

37:03.822 --> 37:06.294
No.

37:06.295 --> 37:07.895
I loved oksana.

37:07.896 --> 37:10.428
I wanted her to have our baby.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.959
I was gonna leave
my wife for her.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.462
You loved her? You
locked her up in a cage.

37:14.463 --> 37:15.703
I only locked her up

37:15.704 --> 37:18.366
to keep her away from
this horrible business.

37:18.367 --> 37:19.807
A business that you started.

37:19.808 --> 37:21.339
I didn't start anything.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.672
I wasn't even born when
this business started.

37:25.414 --> 37:27.845
It's my mother who
brings them here.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.778
My mother...

37:32.881 --> 37:35.354
Is the one who killed oksana.

37:38.557 --> 37:42.490
My son broke the golden rule.

37:42.491 --> 37:44.432
Don't... touch...

37:44.433 --> 37:47.565
The merchandise.

37:47.566 --> 37:51.869
Do you have any idea what
goes into bringing these girls here?

37:51.870 --> 37:55.843
Well, all that money
and hard work went down

37:55.844 --> 37:57.975
the drain when
oksana went missing.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.308
First I thought she had run off,

38:00.309 --> 38:05.513
but I soon found out my son
had stashed her in a love nest.

38:05.514 --> 38:07.485
Unacceptable.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.857
I can understand.

38:09.858 --> 38:11.559
Your son makes a big mess.

38:11.560 --> 38:15.693
You want to hire a big man
to come in and clean it up.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.964
Finds her, finishes her off,

38:16.965 --> 38:19.597
and gives you a nice
necklace as a souvenir.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.629
Hire a man?

38:21.630 --> 38:25.833
When a woman wants something
done right, she does it herself.

38:25.834 --> 38:28.676
So...

38:28.677 --> 38:30.908
I shot the girl

38:30.909 --> 38:34.912
and I left her and
her bastard to die.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.844
I wear her necklace

38:36.845 --> 38:38.786
as a warning to my son...

38:38.787 --> 38:45.523
This is what happens when
you mess with my business.

38:45.524 --> 38:48.526
All right, then how the
hell does Sergei fit into this?

38:48.527 --> 38:50.958
He's got something
to do with it.

38:50.959 --> 38:53.331
Oksana's blood
was all over his shirt.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.034
(Ukrainian accent) Oh, my god.

39:27.035 --> 39:31.098
(Speaking Ukrainian)

39:31.099 --> 39:32.871
(Baby coos)

39:48.857 --> 39:52.760
They're oksana's
parents, aren't they?

39:52.761 --> 39:54.892
And that's her baby. Yes.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.926
When oksana was taken
from the streets of Kiev,

39:58.927 --> 40:02.830
her family hired me to find her.

40:02.831 --> 40:04.532
I followed her here.

40:04.533 --> 40:07.835
She had been sold
into prostitution.

40:07.836 --> 40:09.707
So I went to the
underground clubs.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.838
Like tatyana's.

40:10.839 --> 40:13.080
Yes. I tell girls I meet,

40:13.081 --> 40:14.842
"if you see her, you call me,

40:14.843 --> 40:19.447
and if you call me, I get
you out of the life as well."

40:19.448 --> 40:23.851
And finally two girls...

40:23.852 --> 40:25.022
They called.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.694
Right after we were together?

40:26.695 --> 40:27.995
Yeah.

40:27.996 --> 40:30.528
I immediately went to
find her, but I was too late.

40:30.529 --> 40:34.562
I tried to save her, but
she died in my arms.

40:34.563 --> 40:35.863
She was pregnant.

40:35.864 --> 40:37.705
This baby was alive.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.967
So my job was not done.

40:39.968 --> 40:43.671
Getting the baby
to oksana's parents.

40:43.672 --> 40:47.575
As I said, this story
was not mine to tell.

40:47.576 --> 40:50.679
Not until I unite them.

40:54.953 --> 40:59.456
I have extracted, uh,
many bullets in my years,

40:59.457 --> 41:02.891
but little Katya...

41:04.793 --> 41:07.636
This was my first
delivery. (Chuckles)

41:09.798 --> 41:11.499
You had quite a night. (Laughs)

41:11.500 --> 41:13.501
Yes, I did.

41:13.502 --> 41:15.803
You called her Katya?

41:15.804 --> 41:19.877
Two extraordinary females...

41:19.878 --> 41:24.852
They come into
my life in one night.

41:24.853 --> 41:27.586
One should be
named after the other.

41:36.825 --> 41:38.026
My Katya.

41:41.930 --> 41:45.002
This probably
should be good-bye.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.736
Yeah.

41:48.737 --> 41:50.679
Probably.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.223
(Sergei speaks indistinctly)

42:08.997 --> 42:10.729
(Sergei speaks Ukrainian)
