00:31.248 --> 00:32.967
Oi! Slow down!

00:41.040 --> 00:45.239
Wake up. Shirley Redmond's gone
into labour. I'm coming with you.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.360
Best be safe,
under the circumstances.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.000
Come on!

01:03.680 --> 01:05.919
Don't leave me, Mum.
Where am I going to go?

01:05.920 --> 01:07.880
No-one's going anywhere.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.260
All fine, love?

01:14.261 --> 01:16.779
Yeah, she's all right.
Going like clockwork.

01:16.780 --> 01:18.300
Towels.

01:19.740 --> 01:20.819
Thank you.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.565
Squeeze my hand. Good girl

01:29.580 --> 01:30.980
All right, boy?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.659
Everything's perfect.

01:34.660 --> 01:38.139
It's not going to be born dead like
the last time, is it, Sister?

01:38.140 --> 01:40.499
You're doing everything
you should be doing,

01:40.500 --> 01:42.739
so stop wasting
all this energy worrying.

01:47.380 --> 01:51.219
The head is crowned, so the next few
contractions are really important.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.019
I need you to do exactly as I say,
all right?

01:54.020 --> 01:56.179
Keep panting for me, Shirley.

01:58.620 --> 02:02.140
Lord, I'm coming, Shirl. Hang on,
love! Hang on, I'm on my way.

02:03.660 --> 02:06.059
Here we are.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.540
Shirl?

02:09.192 --> 02:12.272
You have a beautiful little girl,
Mr Redmond.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.939
Listen to her.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.179
Listen to her!

02:23.180 --> 02:26.780
She's got a set of lungs on her,
hasn't she?

02:30.300 --> 02:34.259
'During my years in the East End,
I cycled through sunny streets.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.179
'Mothers were safely
delivered of their babies

02:37.180 --> 02:39.659
'and the whole world
seemed to shine.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.779
'It was easy to forget the sparks
of darkness in the diamond,

02:42.780 --> 02:45.419
'the shadows in the corners
of the brightest day.'

02:45.420 --> 02:48.139
You still managing to keep up,
Nurse Lee?

02:48.140 --> 02:50.579
Absolutely, Sister Evangelina.

02:52.220 --> 02:55.859
Oi! Watch yourself, or I'll shove
that aspidistra up your...

03:06.300 --> 03:08.980
So much space after our little flat.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.819
Now, now, now, now, now.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.539
If you go down there,
we'll never get you back up again.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.899
I am starting to resemble some sort of
disgusting, beached mammal, aren't I?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.060
I don't know how you can bear
to look at me.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.299
I deserve the George Cross.

03:26.300 --> 03:31.819
I suppose the thought of making love
to me again is unbearable.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.979
I couldn't even begin to explain.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.660
Have you started to think
about other women?

03:35.661 --> 03:37.340
Every moment of the day.

03:40.260 --> 03:45.899
You regret ever setting eyes on me,
don't you? Isn't it apparent?

03:45.900 --> 03:48.499
You're planning your escape
as we kiss.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.420
Why do you think
I haven't unpacked yet?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.419
Jenny, are you naked and indecent?

03:58.420 --> 04:00.659
Yes, come in.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.499
I've got lacquer in my eye.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.259
Hurry up and get it out. There's
someone on the telephone for you.

04:06.260 --> 04:09.619
Sympathy wouldn't go amiss. You poor
thing Everything all right?

04:09.620 --> 04:11.560
Just an overreaction
to a teensy spot

04:11.561 --> 04:13.499
of hair lacquer.
Shall I take a peek?

04:13.500 --> 04:17.539
No time! She has an important
call waiting. How exciting!

04:17.540 --> 04:20.779
It's Jimmy.
We'd never have guessed.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.819
Wouldn't a spot of privacy
be more appropriate?

04:32.820 --> 04:34.819
It would, thank you, Chummy.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.740
Right, well, I'll leave you to it.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.620
Please hold the line for one moment.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.579
Sorry, Jimmy, I was doing my hair.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.579
'I just wondered if you fancied
going up West tomorrow night?'

04:55.580 --> 04:59.020
We could go to the cinema,
that Elvis Presley film is playing.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.059
'Come on, what do you say?'

05:04.060 --> 05:05.939
All right. What time?

05:05.940 --> 05:09.339
I'll call round about six.
Have a drink first. How's that?

05:09.340 --> 05:13.259
All right. Bye. Doesn't anyone else
feel a bit childish?

05:13.260 --> 05:16.339
That's the point, Cynthia.
It's supposed to be fun.

05:16.340 --> 05:20.179
We're trying to find out exactly
what's going on with Jimmy.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.979
What, alone? For the whole weekend?
Jimmy, we couldn't!

05:24.980 --> 05:28.099
You are a terrible actress,
Jenny Lee.

05:28.100 --> 05:33.019
And you are all terrible spies.
Especially you, Sister Bernadette.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.740
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:39.860 --> 05:43.139
So apart from the tiredness...
I'm fine.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.699
I didn't think it was possible
after last time,

05:45.700 --> 05:48.019
but I've never felt happier.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.660
Or felt better.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.340
I'm glad.

05:57.380 --> 06:01.419
I think you're well enough to visit us
at the clinic from now on, Mrs Redmond.

06:01.420 --> 06:04.340
Good. I'm dying to show her off.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.459
Something wrong?

06:09.460 --> 06:14.820
Ron's keen to know when
we can, you know...

06:16.620 --> 06:18.540
Resume marital relations?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.419
Things are different with this one.
Everything is new.

06:23.420 --> 06:28.540
Last time I... I wasn't myself,
was I? Not for a while.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.780
As long as there's no pain
or discomfort...

06:37.380 --> 06:40.139
proceed with caution
would be my advice.

06:40.140 --> 06:41.979
I'll use them exact words!

06:41.980 --> 06:44.619
Bring the baby through, Mum.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.619
Nurse is ready for her now.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.659
She's woken up in perfect time.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.059
Doesn't she look lovely
with her matching outfit?

06:54.060 --> 06:57.619
You won't get one of them
in the shops. Mum made it for her.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.100
Wait! Wait!

07:46.100 --> 07:49.979
That was exquisite.
You should be in the Albert Hall.

07:49.980 --> 07:52.099
I've told you a million times,

07:52.100 --> 07:56.099
I'm only average, David.
Always been too lazy to practise.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.419
You all right, darling?

07:59.420 --> 08:03.380
Just a bit light-headed.
I stood up too quick.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.539
Are you sure you'll be all right?

08:06.540 --> 08:08.539
I don't have to go.

08:08.540 --> 08:14.099
Go and drink beer and talk cricket with
your cricket bores and stop fussing.

08:14.100 --> 08:18.939
We can always ring Dr Carlton, you don't
have to wait for your next appointment.

08:18.940 --> 08:23.019
It's just a slight headache, David,
perfectly normal.

08:23.020 --> 08:27.219
There's a National Health clinic
at the Parish Hall tomorrow,

08:27.220 --> 08:29.939
if I still feel out of sorts
by then, I'll pop in.

08:29.940 --> 08:35.140
Promise? Promise.
Now do stop fussing and go.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.539
How was Elvis Presley?

08:47.540 --> 08:51.459
Not my cup of tea,
but I can see the attraction.

08:51.460 --> 08:54.619
His moves are interesting,
to say the least.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.219
I know. Marvellous, isn't it?

08:56.220 --> 08:58.699
He's absolutely gorgeous.
I'd die for him.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.619
Obviously. He's male and under 30.

09:00.620 --> 09:04.979
An interest in the opposite sex
is perfectly natural.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.340
Sorry, Peggy.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.659
Hello.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.859
I'd like to speak
to someone in charge, please.

09:26.860 --> 09:30.379
Nurse Miller, duty midwife.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.699
How may I help?

09:32.700 --> 09:35.259
Would it be possible
to see the doctor?

09:35.260 --> 09:37.659
Is this your first visit?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.379
Obviously not my first ever visit.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.139
I'm registered with Dr Carlton,
south of the river.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.939
We recently moved here, but my next
appointment isn't until next week and...

09:47.940 --> 09:54.099
Name? Margaret Jones.
Mrs Margaret Jones.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.960
Please take a seat, Mrs Jones.

09:56.961 --> 09:59.819
I'll be back as soon as I
can to take your details.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.339
Don't worry, Mrs Blake,
your turn next.

10:02.340 --> 10:05.060
Marie O'Connor?

10:08.300 --> 10:11.939
She's adorable. What's her name?
Gillian.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.019
You wouldn't say that at two in the
morning. I could throttle her then!

10:15.020 --> 10:18.179
How long have you got to wait?
A few months yet.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.899
It's lovely being a mum.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.940
Stop it! Come here!

10:25.860 --> 10:28.220
Stop it!

10:31.780 --> 10:37.260
Patricia! Patricia, get back here
now before I lamp you one an' all.

10:38.340 --> 10:41.860
What you turning your nose up at?

10:43.300 --> 10:44.379
Excuse me?

10:44.380 --> 10:49.179
Did you see that? She was only
having a gawp at her beads.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.420
Just a little kid an' all, in't she?

10:54.220 --> 10:57.859
Eileen Blake,
she lives in my street.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.939
A right troublemaker!

10:59.940 --> 11:01.979
Just ignore her.

11:01.980 --> 11:05.939
Here, what you saying about me,
Shirley Redmond?

11:05.940 --> 11:07.460
Say it to my face.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.100
Stuck up bitch.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.260
I've got to go.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.660
Margaret Jones?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.779
Fancy bumping into you.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.800
Well, I was passing
Nonnatus House earlier

11:38.801 --> 11:40.819
and I stole a
glance at the rota.

11:40.820 --> 11:42.900
I've been hanging
around here for half an

11:42.901 --> 11:44.979
hour or so, waiting
for you to come past.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.460
I see. Any particular reason?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.699
A most particular one, actually.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.459
I was thinking what a nice time
we had at the pictures

11:54.460 --> 11:56.320
and how it seems daft
not to do it again.

11:56.321 --> 11:58.179
Well, sooner rather than later.

11:58.180 --> 12:02.259
So... what do you say?

12:02.260 --> 12:06.099
I'd say it seems worse than daft.
It seems positively idiotic.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.540
Well, there we go then.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.419
It's only an early supper
before the cinema,

12:24.420 --> 12:26.219
not dinner at the Dorchester.

12:26.220 --> 12:29.979
But things are progressing, Chummy,
so it may as well be.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.859
You have to think strategically.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.819
This could be a pivotal moment.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.499
Do you really think so?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.379
Absolutely no idea.

12:39.380 --> 12:43.419
Sit up and follow me.
Imagine you're at the Dorchester.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.780
But we aren't going...
Shut up and do as I say.

12:47.820 --> 12:51.060
Ready? Like this.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.419
Excuse me!

12:56.420 --> 13:01.779
Remember, he'll be watching
your every move.

13:01.780 --> 13:06.179
So when he pulls the chair out
for you, take your time.

13:12.780 --> 13:15.979
When he sits opposite,
lean in slightly

13:15.980 --> 13:17.979
and tilt your head

13:17.980 --> 13:21.859
so that you have to look at him
through your eyelashes.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.939
Hold that pose for quite a while.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.539
It could give one's neck
an awful crick.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.699
Obviously, it's a pose
you'll have to get used to.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.740
Thank you!

13:33.980 --> 13:37.499
You are a woman
comfortable with making decisions.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.299
Look at him directly in the eyes

13:47.300 --> 13:53.100
and say it like it's the naughtiest
thing you've EVER said in your life.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.859
Fish and chips, please.

13:58.860 --> 14:01.259
And can you put the vinegar
on first?

14:01.260 --> 14:03.340
Chummy!

14:21.620 --> 14:25.059
Come out here for a bit,
get some fresh air to her legs.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.459
What's Mummy saying?
What's Mummy saying?

14:27.460 --> 14:31.300
Shall we go and see her?
Come on then. Come on.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.819
Stick with the job in hand, you...

14:35.820 --> 14:39.139
me and my girl are having
a little dance to ourselves.

14:39.140 --> 14:43.500
Ain't we, sweetheart?

14:54.700 --> 14:57.460
All right now.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.180
Gently does it.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.619
You should have called my secretary,
I'd have come home earlier.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.659
I can't remember
if I locked the back door.

15:12.660 --> 15:14.459
Don't worry about that, darling.

15:14.460 --> 15:18.779
We'll only be gone an hour. Besides,
it's a pretty decent neighbourhood.

15:18.780 --> 15:21.899
Margaret? Margaret?

15:21.900 --> 15:24.860
Margaret!

15:26.140 --> 15:27.420
Ma...?

15:29.460 --> 15:31.059
Help, help me!

15:31.060 --> 15:33.300
Help me, please!

15:38.620 --> 15:40.540
We were on our way to the doctor's,

15:40.541 --> 15:42.900
and my wife had a
fit of some sort.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.259
She's been complaining of
headaches for the last few days.

15:45.260 --> 15:47.059
When's the baby due?

15:47.060 --> 15:49.460
She's 27 weeks.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.499
You need to get her to the hospital
as soon as possible.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.819
Will you be all right
to drive her there?

15:55.820 --> 15:58.179
It'd be quicker
than waiting for an ambulance.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.979
Yes... yes.

16:00.980 --> 16:04.579
You carry on to Mrs Weston's
and I'll stay to help. All right.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.419
You must hurry.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.819
What's her name?

16:08.820 --> 16:12.860
Margaret... Jones.
Is she going to be all right?

16:13.980 --> 16:16.459
Mrs Margaret Jones.

16:16.460 --> 16:22.260
I'll warn the hospital
that you're on the way. Now, go.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.579
Nurse, it was eclampsia.
Baby didn't make it.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.419
Mrs Jones hasn't got long.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.340
I see.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.380
Mr Jones?

16:49.940 --> 16:51.580
I got here as soon as I could.

16:54.820 --> 16:55.980
It was a little girl.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.660
I'm so sorry.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.820
She was too small.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.618
They say her lungs weren't...

17:07.619 --> 17:11.460
Is there someone
you'd like me to call?

17:13.660 --> 17:16.539
There's no-one else.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.659
Just the two of us.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.140
Margaret and I.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.499
We were going to call her Helen.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.660
Thomas, had he been a boy.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.579
What will I tell Margaret?

17:36.580 --> 17:39.899
The doctor did explain
the situation?

17:39.900 --> 17:42.020
Your wife's condition?

17:44.820 --> 17:49.539
He said it's... toxaemia.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.340
It can also be called eclampsia.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.019
When she's stable,
I'll be able to see her.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.740
Talk to her about the baby.

18:04.020 --> 18:08.139
I need to be strong for her,
don't I? Mr Jones...

18:08.140 --> 18:10.179
We've only been married six months.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.500
Barely known each other a year.
I don't feel strong at all.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.339
It's a really good opportunity

18:24.340 --> 18:26.579
to have first hand experience,
sister.

18:26.580 --> 18:32.339
If you can arrange it, I could
follow this case to its conclusion.

18:32.340 --> 18:34.659
I'd learn so much by being there.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.139
It will be distressing. Are you sure
you'll be able to handle it?

18:39.140 --> 18:43.579
Of course.
I want to be a good nurse.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.980
Whatever it takes.

18:53.100 --> 18:56.419
'Help had come too late
for Margaret,

18:56.420 --> 19:00.179
'so her eclampsia
was a death sentence.

19:00.180 --> 19:06.820
'All her husband could do was watch
and wait.'

19:09.780 --> 19:14.019
Ann Whelan's baby's
an odd-looking little thing.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.780
And Ann's quite pretty, really.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.859
Well?

19:19.860 --> 19:22.060
Fish and chips, then High Society.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.459
What did you talk about?

19:25.460 --> 19:27.299
Horses. His uncle has a farm.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.539
What else? We need details.
Preferably more exciting ones.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.939
Grace Kelly. She's awfully good.
And so attractive.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.939
Stop teasing. I've been working.
You've waited up especially.

19:37.940 --> 19:42.659
I can't believe my intensive course
in the art of seduction failed.

19:42.660 --> 19:45.780
Sit down and have some Horlicks,
Chummy.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.499
He was the perfect gentleman,
actually.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.459
Damn! How disappointing.

19:51.460 --> 19:55.219
Trixie! But...
you are a woman, Chummy,

19:55.220 --> 19:58.019
and Constable Noakes is a man.

19:58.020 --> 20:01.379
So I imagine that the natural
progression of this relationship...

20:01.380 --> 20:06.459
Steady on! ..Will eventually entail
some sort of flirtatious behaviour,

20:06.460 --> 20:10.579
outside the realms of what is
considered gentlemanly conduct.

20:10.580 --> 20:13.939
Were there any other future outings
planned at all?

20:13.940 --> 20:18.099
He did ask if I'd like to accompany
him to the dance next week.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.859
But one has so many
horrific memories.

20:20.860 --> 20:24.059
I couldn't bear to embarrass myself.
I used to feel the same

20:24.060 --> 20:27.819
but I've been with Trixie a few
times and I actually enjoyed it.

20:27.820 --> 20:31.379
I think it depends on the company.
So why don't we all go?

20:31.380 --> 20:35.299
Yes. Let's go dancing.
That's a splendid idea.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.139
I promised Jimmy we'd do something
together at the weekend.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.340
He could come too.

20:40.341 --> 20:42.539
You'll have a wonderful time!

20:42.540 --> 20:45.059
All right, I'll ask him.

20:45.060 --> 20:49.740
Gosh, it seems I'm going
to a dance. Voluntarily.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.379
"Look at me now, Ma."

20:53.380 --> 20:57.099
I take it Constable Noakes is
the source of all this excitement?

20:57.100 --> 20:59.139
It's true what they say, then.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.540
There is a sock
for every old slipper.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.380
How did you meet?

21:36.940 --> 21:38.740
She's a violinist.

21:39.860 --> 21:43.699
Some friends of mine took me
to a concert to hear her play.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.539
I've always admired musicians.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.419
The Swan, by Saint Saens.

21:49.420 --> 21:53.219
That's what she was playing
when I first saw her.

21:53.220 --> 21:58.139
So? After the concert,
you swept her off her feet?

21:58.140 --> 22:01.059
Hardly. We barely spoke.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.419
I've never been very good
around women, I'm rather shy.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.699
But that smile kept me going
for weeks. Look at me.

22:07.700 --> 22:12.699
Headmaster, smitten with a woman
half my age in less than a minute.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.659
Ludicrous, isn't it?

22:14.660 --> 22:16.300
Obviously not.

22:18.820 --> 22:24.099
When I saw her again, near
Lyon's Corner House in Islington,

22:24.100 --> 22:26.579
I couldn't believe my luck.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.299
The first thing she said was,
"What took you so long?

22:29.300 --> 22:31.339
"I'm fed up waiting."

22:31.340 --> 22:34.900
We've been together ever since.
It's been glorious.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.420
You all right?

23:07.180 --> 23:12.019
Aren't you attempting a medical
and physical impossibility, Trixie?

23:12.020 --> 23:14.540
Just takes practice.

23:19.620 --> 23:21.419
Aren't they terribly painful?

23:21.420 --> 23:27.099
Excruciating. Why don't you try
some of my new lipstick, Cynthia?

23:27.100 --> 23:32.099
My lips are too thin.
I'd look silly. There.

23:32.100 --> 23:36.459
How civilised.
It's Pa's favourite tipple.

23:36.460 --> 23:41.539
Maybe it will stop some of us
from being so bloody miserable.

23:41.540 --> 23:44.500
I'm not miserable, I'm tired.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.739
I'll be all right once I get there.

23:50.740 --> 23:53.979
Right. Lawks help me.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.300
Chin chin!

24:05.020 --> 24:06.820
Quick, the gin!

24:13.380 --> 24:17.459
There's a gentleman at the door.

24:17.460 --> 24:21.219
You all look very nice.
Have a lovely evening.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.659
Come on!

24:22.660 --> 24:25.179
Come along, Cynthia.
Good night, Sister.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.460
Hurry up!

24:32.220 --> 24:33.939
Good evening.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.539
Ladies.

24:36.540 --> 24:40.339
We thought, we'd go down
together. Sorry I'm late.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.619
I'd say your timing is perfect,
Jimmy.

24:42.620 --> 24:45.340
Aren't we the lucky fellows?
Don't worry.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.179
Gosh, they're terribly energetic!

26:05.500 --> 26:07.099
Excuse me.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.620
More drinks, gang? Thanks.

26:17.621 --> 26:21.659
Gosh, I've never seen anything
quite like it.

26:21.660 --> 26:24.979
Certainly not at any of the dos
Mother forced me to attend.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.179
This place is positively savage
in comparison.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.139
Well, how about a dance, then?

26:30.140 --> 26:33.579
Good gracious, I'm no dancer.
Neither am I,

26:33.580 --> 26:37.019
but I wouldn't mind giving it a go.
If you promise not to laugh?

26:37.020 --> 26:41.019
Well, if you promise not
to arrest me for common assault

26:41.020 --> 26:44.579
when I tread all over your toes.
I might be some time.

26:44.580 --> 26:46.939
TTFN!

26:52.460 --> 26:55.259
Don't look now. Blond, six four,

26:55.260 --> 26:58.299
dark jacket,
over by the door at ten to twelve.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.460
I'm in love.
I'll be back in five minutes

27:00.461 --> 27:02.619
when I've seduced him
into asking me out.

27:02.620 --> 27:06.539
But you agreed to a date with that
dark-haired chap you danced with.

27:06.540 --> 27:09.139
Obviously I'll be careful not to
overbook myself.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.020
Come in.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.339
I can't sleep.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.220
The toxaemia case?

28:01.180 --> 28:06.099
I haven't mentioned it before
but she came into the clinic,

28:06.100 --> 28:09.939
last week, before her regular
doctor's appointment.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.180
I was a bit short with her

28:11.181 --> 28:13.419
and she left before I had time to
book her in.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.659
That would have made no difference.

28:15.660 --> 28:19.459
I know, but I can't help thinking...
Then don't.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.300
Who knows why these things happen?

28:25.460 --> 28:26.939
Her poor husband, David.

28:26.940 --> 28:28.900
He's so devoted to her.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.539
You have to be brave to be in love,
don't you?

28:33.540 --> 28:37.660
I mean, knowing your heart may get
broken at some point along the way.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.939
Yes, I suppose so.

28:42.940 --> 28:45.659
He spent years being frightened
and lonely

28:45.660 --> 28:47.979
because he's much older than her.

28:47.980 --> 28:50.379
They hardly had any time together

28:50.380 --> 28:54.379
and yet he said that she made
his life truly meaningful.

28:54.380 --> 28:57.579
Love doesn't seem to adhere
to time or boundaries, does it?

28:57.580 --> 29:00.300
It just is.

29:02.860 --> 29:04.980
I didn't know
you were such a romantic.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.740
Neither did I.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.380
Jenny...

29:13.700 --> 29:15.019
What?

29:15.020 --> 29:19.179
We have a duty to live every moment
the best we can.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.979
I mean really live it.

29:21.980 --> 29:24.179
Even if it means getting hurt.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.500
Otherwise, what's the point?

29:28.580 --> 29:31.700
We mustn't let fear stop us.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.220
No.

29:41.820 --> 29:44.299
I'm back, Shirl.
Where's my girl, then?

29:44.300 --> 29:46.579
Did you remember to get the milk?
Course I did.

29:46.580 --> 29:49.979
I called in at the allotments to say
hello to Arthur. How's he doing?

29:49.980 --> 29:53.099
Good. He was asking all about
the baby. Where is she?

29:53.100 --> 29:54.699
Out in the pram in the fresh air.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.220
You passed her on your way in,
you great daft sod.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.819
Mum, is she with you? Who?

30:03.820 --> 30:05.659
The baby, have you got the baby?

30:05.660 --> 30:07.859
What are you talking about?
The baby, Mum!

30:07.860 --> 30:11.859
Have you seen my baby? She was
in her pram. No, love, sorry.

30:11.860 --> 30:15.659
Please, someone help us.
Someone's taken our baby.

30:17.820 --> 30:20.580
Gillian! Gillian!

30:22.900 --> 30:23.940
Police!

30:29.420 --> 30:33.499
Excuse me, stop.
Sorry, have you seen...?

30:33.500 --> 30:37.700
I need to ask your thoughts on
Shirley Redmond's mental state.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.459
She's been ill recently, hasn't she?

30:41.460 --> 30:44.499
I'm not exactly sure
what you're getting at, Constable?

30:44.500 --> 30:48.819
There have been a few questions
raised, I'm afraid.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.579
About what, specifically?

30:51.580 --> 30:53.660
Her behaviour as a mother.

30:53.661 --> 30:55.739
According to a neighbour,
she's been acting strange

30:55.740 --> 30:59.139
since she suffered a stillbirth
two years ago. Eileen Blake!

30:59.140 --> 31:02.299
If she's not careful, she'll feel
the toe of my boot right up...

31:02.300 --> 31:05.619
Sister Evangelina
delivered that poor child.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.819
Shirley suffered
as any mother would.

31:07.820 --> 31:11.419
She wasn't herself for a while.
I assure you, Constable Noakes,

31:11.420 --> 31:13.779
that you are wasting your time

31:13.780 --> 31:15.419
following that line of enquiry.

31:15.420 --> 31:19.499
She was overheard stating
she wanted to hurt her baby.

31:19.500 --> 31:23.779
Rubbish!
That's utterly ridiculous!

31:23.780 --> 31:27.939
You were heard at the clinic saying
you wanted to throttle your child.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.619
I didn't mean it! I love her.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.900
I wouldn't hurt her for the world.

31:42.580 --> 31:45.899
How are we? Bearing up.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.339
Thank God Margaret's a fighter.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.939
Could I ask you a favour, nurse?

31:50.940 --> 31:53.019
A favour?

31:53.020 --> 31:55.379
I need some things from home.

31:55.380 --> 32:00.179
A razor, a few toiletries,
a clean shirt, that sort of thing.

32:00.180 --> 32:02.019
I don't want to leave her.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.659
Please.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.619
If I make a list and write down
the address, could you?

32:06.620 --> 32:09.739
Yes. Yes, of course.

32:09.740 --> 32:11.780
Thank you.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.540
Thank you very much, madam.

33:09.340 --> 33:13.419
Best get these
out of the way before she wakes.

33:13.420 --> 33:18.019
Are you sure you'll be able to
carry them back to Nonnatus, Sister?

33:18.020 --> 33:19.700
I'll be absolutely fine, Nurse Lee.

33:19.701 --> 33:22.579
When they're dry,
Sister Evangelina will pick them up.

33:22.580 --> 33:25.459
I've never seen her so upset.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.020
You must remain strong
if you're to stay

33:28.021 --> 33:30.579
here for the night and
give some comfort.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.539
The situation can only be served

33:32.540 --> 33:35.339
by someone with a clear head
and an open heart.

33:35.340 --> 33:39.539
You are a good nurse. I trust
you will rise to the occasion.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.619
I'll do my best, Sister.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.340
I have every faith in you.

33:46.740 --> 33:51.580
If you hear any news, call
Nonnatus House right away. I will.

33:54.340 --> 33:58.379
Ron? Have you found her?
Have you brought her back?

33:58.380 --> 33:59.860
No, love.

34:01.500 --> 34:06.180
I want her back home, now.
I want my Gillian back home.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.659
She's alive.

34:16.940 --> 34:18.580
I know she is.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.179
Her milk.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.580
Come with me, Shirley.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.659
Come on.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.699
Gladys, can you see that Ron gets
a hot drink inside him?

34:44.699 --> 34:46.219
Of course I will. Yeah.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.499
Take it.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.899
Take it.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.499
The pains will stop if you take it.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.899
I know how it feels, see.

35:18.900 --> 35:22.939
You're not sick, you're just hungry!

35:22.940 --> 35:25.900
Now take the bloody milk, will ya!

35:27.860 --> 35:30.739
Peggy, is Fred here?
I've got a ghastly puncture.

35:30.740 --> 35:32.379
He's in the garden, I think.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.659
Righty-ho.
Any news on the Redmond baby?

35:36.660 --> 35:38.420
I'm afraid not.

35:39.860 --> 35:42.819
"The worldly life grows down apace:

35:42.820 --> 35:47.739
"But does the milk that's drawn from
the cow go back to the bullock?"

35:47.740 --> 35:50.499
Sorry, Sister?

35:50.500 --> 35:54.499
Sister Monica Joan has been talking
about the mystic poets.

35:54.500 --> 35:58.979
What's all this for? People have
been out searching for that baby

35:58.980 --> 36:03.059
the moment they get home from work.
We thought we'd offer refreshments.

36:03.060 --> 36:06.179
"A barren cow
gives birth to a bullock..."

36:06.180 --> 36:10.060
Sister Monica Joan, please!

36:16.180 --> 36:18.059
They're all talking about me.

36:18.060 --> 36:20.379
They think I've done something bad.

36:20.380 --> 36:23.819
Let 'em. We know the truth, love.

36:23.820 --> 36:27.300
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

36:30.540 --> 36:33.579
Try and stay with it, Shirl.

36:33.580 --> 36:35.419
Please. For me.

36:46.580 --> 36:49.019
Thought you might need a few things.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.539
You didn't have to go
to all that trouble, nurse.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.820
I didn't. It was Sister Julienne.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.300
Besides, I wanted to come.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.780
She doesn't like it
when I haven't shaved.

37:40.660 --> 37:45.899
There, darling,
smooth enough for you?

37:45.900 --> 37:47.340
Do I pass the test?

37:52.300 --> 37:56.019
They want your permission
to take Margaret's wedding ring off.

37:56.020 --> 37:59.619
I've already told them
she'd never forgive me.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.180
She swore to never take it off.

38:03.180 --> 38:06.540
I can do it, if you prefer. No.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.539
The doctor doesn't seem
to think you understand

38:10.540 --> 38:12.500
the severity of the situation.

38:14.500 --> 38:19.179
Please, listen to me.
We can only make her comfortable.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.300
Nothing more.

38:21.980 --> 38:24.740
She is dying, Mr Jones.

38:25.820 --> 38:29.259
You don't know my wife.
You don't know her strength.

38:29.260 --> 38:33.779
Her body is failing
and it will keep on failing.

38:33.780 --> 38:38.140
I'm sorry but nothing can prevent
that from happening.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.460
I want to look after her.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.100
I want to do everything for her.

38:48.900 --> 38:52.419
She's my soulmate.
That's why she's still here with me.

38:52.420 --> 38:55.140
But she's suffering, Mr Jones.

39:00.700 --> 39:05.819
Some people need permission
to die...

39:05.820 --> 39:08.260
from those that they love the most.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.380
Do it now, then.

39:48.700 --> 39:50.580
Cut the ring off now.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.579
I've found something.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.180
I've found something.

40:37.500 --> 40:40.980
It's Gillian's. I know it.

40:46.540 --> 40:51.339
I'm sorry,
but I need you to tell me.

40:51.340 --> 40:52.820
Is it hers?

40:54.940 --> 40:57.340
It's the one you made her, isn't it?

41:01.100 --> 41:03.220
It's part of a matching set.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.900
You've got to stay here for a while.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.699
Mammy has to go to work, my angel.

41:31.700 --> 41:35.340
Otherwise we'll starve, won't we?

41:39.460 --> 41:41.899
You looking for company, mister?

41:41.900 --> 41:45.620
I'm very reasonable... honest.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.259
Sorry to hear about
your toxaemia patient, Cynthia.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.579
It's an awful way to go. Yes.

42:50.580 --> 42:54.019
How's the husband?
As you'd imagine.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.579
They were soulmates.
You don't actually believe

42:56.580 --> 42:58.420
in the notion of soulmates, do you?

42:58.421 --> 43:00.899
Yes, I think I do.

43:00.900 --> 43:05.579
You are kidding me?
What romantic tosh! Do be quiet!

43:05.580 --> 43:07.459
Not everyone feels as you do.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.979
All right?

43:11.980 --> 43:16.419
Yes, we were just talking about
soulmates.

43:16.420 --> 43:20.100
"Soulmates."
Rather like the sound of that.

44:02.740 --> 44:03.859
Any news?

44:03.860 --> 44:09.139
No. It's Shirley. We've had the
doctors out, but... What's happened?

44:09.140 --> 44:11.979
Well, she's stopped talking again.
She's had a funny turn.

44:11.980 --> 44:15.460
Just stares.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

44:25.100 --> 44:29.220
Blaming yourself won't do any good.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.740
Now, listen to me.

44:34.380 --> 44:38.179
Ron is not strong.
That's why he chose you.

44:38.180 --> 44:40.980
You won't do anybody any good
like this.

44:45.820 --> 44:49.659
It was love that brought Gillian
to you, remember?

44:49.660 --> 44:54.619
Whatever happens,
you will only find peace

44:54.620 --> 44:58.940
by loving those that need you
and Ron needs you.

45:01.660 --> 45:05.379
Am I going to have to whisper
in your ear until the sun goes down?

45:05.380 --> 45:08.340
Because my backside
is starting to go numb.

45:38.540 --> 45:40.819
Oi! Oi! Stop her!

45:40.820 --> 45:43.780
Oi! Oi! Stop her!

45:46.220 --> 45:49.620
Police! Police! Police!

45:55.300 --> 45:57.699
Don't you people
have any sense of decency?

45:57.700 --> 46:01.619
Go away. Go on, go away.

46:01.620 --> 46:04.219
It's Nurse Lee.

46:04.220 --> 46:08.219
Mrs Redmond, what can you tell us
about the missing baby?

46:08.220 --> 46:12.739
I should take the dog out
when your mum gets back.

46:12.740 --> 46:15.699
Poor thing doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

46:15.700 --> 46:20.740
I could stay for another
ten minutes, if it's any help?

46:30.220 --> 46:33.220
I really can't imagine
what you're going through.

46:36.020 --> 46:38.379
If there was anything I could do...

46:38.380 --> 46:42.700
You know, I didn't realise how much
my mum loved me till I was a mum.

46:44.780 --> 46:48.019
It's the kind of love
that only goes one way.

46:48.020 --> 46:52.939
Forward. Only realise that
when you have your own.

46:52.940 --> 46:56.180
When it's too late
to change your mind.

46:59.260 --> 47:03.019
I know what they mean now,
when they say love hurts.

47:03.020 --> 47:06.659
Can't have one without the other.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.940
Not ever.

47:09.820 --> 47:14.220
Yet we keep on doing it again
and again.

47:15.580 --> 47:17.140
I wonder why?

47:25.500 --> 47:27.640
Before you turn off
towards Market Street.

47:27.641 --> 47:29.780
That's where she is.
Right. Come on.

47:37.900 --> 47:42.220
We've got to stay strong now,
Kathleen, it's the only way.

47:43.220 --> 47:48.540
We've only got each other. It'll be
all right now we're together again.

47:49.740 --> 47:51.540
She doesn't look right in the head.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.540
How was the baby?
I only got a quick look.

47:53.541 --> 47:56.300
I don't know if it's alive.
There's one way to find out.

47:58.460 --> 48:02.139
'I didn't know it, but as I walked
into the warehouse,

48:02.140 --> 48:04.780
'I stepped through a door
into the past.

48:07.180 --> 48:09.340
'There were ghosts in these shadows.

48:10.900 --> 48:12.619
'The ghosts of an encounter

48:12.620 --> 48:16.900
'where love had tried and failed.'

48:20.380 --> 48:21.500
Hello there?

48:22.860 --> 48:24.180
Get away.

48:29.660 --> 48:31.900
Don't be afraid. I'm a nurse.

48:34.420 --> 48:37.219
If you or your baby are hurt,
I can help.

48:37.220 --> 48:41.259
Get away. My Kathleen is back safe
where she belongs now.

48:41.260 --> 48:44.300
(Oh, my God. I know her.)

48:49.380 --> 48:50.420
Stay here.

48:52.820 --> 48:54.379
Who's there?

48:54.380 --> 48:57.339
Don't come any closer.

48:57.340 --> 49:00.019
Mary?

49:00.020 --> 49:03.380
Mary, it's Jenny Lee. Remember?

49:05.460 --> 49:09.739
You stay away from us, you hear me?

49:09.740 --> 49:12.540
I swear I won't get too close.

49:15.460 --> 49:18.940
I'd like to see your face.
And the baby's.

49:20.380 --> 49:22.660
To make sure you're both well.

49:31.980 --> 49:38.860
Mary? I won't let anyone take
her again. I'll die first.

49:40.620 --> 49:42.899
Let me see her face.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.540
I'll stay right here.

49:57.180 --> 50:00.860
Can you see how she's
a little floppy in your arms?

50:03.180 --> 50:05.019
That's because she needs water.

50:05.020 --> 50:08.979
We have to get some liquids into her
very soon, or she might die.

50:08.980 --> 50:12.859
I can take care of Kathleen
better than anyone. I love her.

50:12.860 --> 50:15.299
Yes.

50:15.300 --> 50:17.980
I only want to be a good mother.

50:20.380 --> 50:23.699
It's something I can be good at.

50:23.700 --> 50:27.540
It's my real purpose.
I'm sure of it.

50:30.220 --> 50:34.300
Mary, please listen to me.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.900
That baby isn't yours.

50:40.340 --> 50:42.180
Look at the way she looks at me.

50:44.700 --> 50:47.380
Isn't that the way
a child looks at its mother?

50:52.260 --> 50:56.139
Remember how much it hurt when
Kathleen got taken away from you.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.860
Stop saying such terrible things.
That baby's mother

50:58.861 --> 51:01.579
is going through exactly
the same thing right now.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.499
I'll kill myself,

51:03.500 --> 51:05.660
as God is my judge.

51:07.380 --> 51:11.460
Mary, your baby is safe.

51:12.940 --> 51:16.220
It's well looked after. She's loved.

51:17.660 --> 51:19.660
This baby could die now.

51:30.980 --> 51:32.580
What's her name?

51:33.900 --> 51:35.339
Gillian.

51:35.340 --> 51:37.820
Gillian Redmond.

51:38.860 --> 51:42.619
She doesn't look like
a Gillian to me.

51:42.620 --> 51:45.339
And the mammy?

51:45.340 --> 51:47.220
Is she a nice woman?

51:48.780 --> 51:50.300
She is.

51:51.580 --> 51:54.220
She's in a terrible state.

51:55.860 --> 51:59.020
Does she have a decent husband
with a good job?

52:00.180 --> 52:03.020
This "Mammy in a terrible state"?

52:05.100 --> 52:06.219
Yes.

52:06.220 --> 52:11.340
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
she's got it all, hasn't she?

52:12.820 --> 52:14.499
Lucky bitch!

52:14.500 --> 52:18.699
That baby's mother is pining
after her child.

52:18.700 --> 52:21.579
You know what a terrible feeling
that is.

52:21.580 --> 52:25.460
I knew all along this wasn't
my Kathleen, I did. I knew.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.300
My Kathleen's prettier.

52:32.820 --> 52:36.100
But this one's got something
about her too.

52:38.020 --> 52:40.380
Let me have her.

52:42.260 --> 52:44.379
She needs water.

52:44.380 --> 52:46.420
Just one more minute.

52:49.540 --> 52:53.380
Let me take enough
to help me through the rest of it.

54:44.940 --> 54:46.220
Mary...

54:57.220 --> 54:58.459
How is she?

54:58.460 --> 54:59.539
Pitiful.

54:59.540 --> 55:02.339
I understand what Mary did
was an awful thing

55:02.340 --> 55:05.659
but if she goes to prison
she won't get any help at all.

55:05.660 --> 55:09.459
And worse, she'll have never had
anyone to speak for her.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.700
Not in the whole of her life.

55:14.700 --> 55:17.779
Let me get this straight, Sister.

55:17.780 --> 55:21.019
You want us to ask for leniency
for the evil that stole our baby?

55:21.020 --> 55:22.659
Mary is a very sick young woman.

55:22.660 --> 55:25.100
Well, she'd swing
if I had anything to do with it.

55:25.101 --> 55:28.019
I'd put the noose around her neck
myself. She's barely 16.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.859
Her own baby was taken for adoption

55:30.860 --> 55:33.380
and her mental health broke down.

55:34.380 --> 55:38.500
I think you'd best leave
before I say something out of turn.

55:40.780 --> 55:42.579
Ron's right.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.699
Of course it's only you here
that knows the weight of such pain.

55:45.700 --> 55:48.619
There's no words can describe it.

55:48.620 --> 55:52.099
Some say it's a kind of madness.
And, I would have thought,

55:52.100 --> 55:55.259
worthy of anyone's compassion.
All right, that's enough.

55:55.260 --> 55:57.180
Leave.

56:06.660 --> 56:09.700
Sister Evangelina?

56:11.060 --> 56:13.660
What do you want me to say
to the police?

56:22.740 --> 56:24.060
Nurse Miller.

56:29.740 --> 56:34.259
'Nurses often receive
tokens of appreciation from patients

56:34.260 --> 56:36.139
'or their loved ones.

56:36.140 --> 56:39.299
'David Jones sent Cynthia a note

56:39.300 --> 56:41.580
'and a long playing record.'

57:02.860 --> 57:08.139
'The exquisite music was heard
throughout Nonnatus House.

57:08.140 --> 57:11.339
'And its message touched
our whole community,

57:11.340 --> 57:13.539
'for just as the swan's last song

57:13.540 --> 57:16.339
'is the sweetest of its life,

57:16.340 --> 57:21.619
'so loss is made endurable by love

57:21.620 --> 57:27.700
'and it is love
that will echo through eternity.'

57:49.140 --> 57:52.740
Fancy getting out of the East End
for a bit? What do you think?

57:55.580 --> 57:59.619
You've got a lot more pig than you
bargained for. She's pregnant.

57:59.620 --> 58:01.459
Give me strength, oh, Lord.

58:01.460 --> 58:03.299
Frank?

58:03.300 --> 58:05.899
It's my Frank. He's took bad.

58:05.900 --> 58:08.699
Please, Sister, please come quick.

58:08.700 --> 58:12.979
My mother insists on meeting the
woman I can't stop talking about.

58:12.980 --> 58:17.699
What do I do, Sister?
How do I be without him?

58:17.700 --> 58:20.300
He was everything to me,
except mine.

58:21.380 --> 58:25.739
You look at me and there's
someone else you want to see.
