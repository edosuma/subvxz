Miss Crawford, I have always
wanted to meet you.

Ah, exactly the person
I've come to see.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.700
This paper has a rather tiresome
policy of asking new people

01:59.733 --> 02:02.066
to write something for
The Sunday Magazine.

Well, excellent, why don't you
come up with a couple of ideas

02:14.333 --> 02:15.800
and we'll see
if something is suitable.

such marvelous muscles?

I suppose.

Very vivid.

from home, Balki.

Don't you get homesick
sometimes?

06:24.733 --> 06:27.100
Yes sometimes, but I bring
some things with me

06:27.133 --> 06:28.233

to Halsted

happened that... I don't
understand.

to come over to your house

09:26.533 --> 09:29.133
to see your tapestry...

09:29.166 --> 09:31.300
Does that mean
what I think it means?

09:33.833 --> 09:35.666
Well...

09:37.533 --> 09:40.466
...it could mean she's just
interested in tapestries.

What about if you're
alone with a woman

09:49.066 --> 09:52.166
that your eyeballs roll back
up into your head?

to hurt your feelings.

Well, what if she wants
to see more?

11:08.700 --> 11:11.400

this is nothing.

Even if it were,
you can take care of yourself.

with women before.

were all over you.

them off with a crook.

snow, aren't you?

feel better...

Maybe we should open the door.

‐ Oh... Larry.
‐ Hello, Miss Crawford.

12:24.533 --> 12:27.600
Hello, Larry. I‐I wasn't
expecting you here.

I live here.
Balki and I are cousins.

12:30.466 --> 12:33.000
Oh... how nice.

Hello, Miss Crawford.

12:35.366 --> 12:36.433
Hello, Balki.

12:36.466 --> 12:37.766
Won't you come in?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.733
Yes. Uh, actually I was supposed
to be at the mayor's

12:40.766 --> 12:42.366
for cocktails 15 minutes ago.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.766
I wonder
if you would mind terribly

12:44.800 --> 12:47.100
if I just took a quick look
at the tapestry

12:47.133 --> 12:49.366
and then hit the road?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.633
Well... you should have called.

12:51.666 --> 12:53.566
I would have run it down
to your car.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.500
I'll go get it.

12:57.366 --> 13:01.466
Balki, I think Miss Crawford
just wants to look

13:01.500 --> 13:02.733
at the tapestry.

13:02.766 --> 13:04.466
Call me embarrassed.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.133
I... I did not understand
why she came.

13:09.166 --> 13:12.066
I have so much to learn about
American women.

Look, if I leave right now

13:16.433 --> 13:18.766
I can till get some research
done at the library.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.733
‐ Can I go?
‐ Yes, yes, cousin.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.466
And thank you, thank you
for showing me how wrong I was.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.033
Hey, it's why
I'm here.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.233
Well, I'm sorry
I can't stay, Miss Crawford.

13:34.266 --> 13:36.166
Oh! Aw...

13:37.266 --> 13:38.600
I have to go to library.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.766
Uh, I hear the editor
of the Sunday Magazine

13:40.800 --> 13:43.300
is tough on people who don't
make their deadlines.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.333
Hmm, they tell me,
she's hell on wheels.

13:46.466 --> 13:48.133
Well, don't just
stand there grinning.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.700
Get out there
and get me a story.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.500
I'm going.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.200
[humming]

14:07.733 --> 14:10.466
[coughs]

14:12.200 --> 14:14.600
Cousin Larry should go easy
on the cheap cologne.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
Here it is.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.433
Oh, Balki,
this is exquisite.

14:21.466 --> 14:23.266
‐ Do you like it?
‐ Oh, yes!

14:23.300 --> 14:25.033
Oh, I'm so glad.

14:25.066 --> 14:27.400
This is a very, very
special tapestry.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.766
It show the entire history
of the island of Mypos.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.533
For instance,
this represents Ferdinand Mypos

14:35.566 --> 14:37.600
discovering that
Mypos is an island.

14:39.133 --> 14:41.766
Oh, you mean, this little man
who appears to be drowning?

14:43.433 --> 14:46.433
Yes, he made the discovery when
he was trying to walk to Italy.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.633
And this over here...

14:51.066 --> 14:54.666
...this represents
the great tomato famine.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.466
It was terrible.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.166
Thousands and thousands
of tomatoes died.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.600
Fascinating.

15:02.633 --> 15:06.233
Listen, Miss Crawford,
I‐I‐I just want to tell you

15:06.266 --> 15:07.700
I have to get something
off my chest.

15:07.733 --> 15:09.166
What, Balki?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.266
I...

15:11.366 --> 15:13.100
...well, when...

15:13.133 --> 15:15.600
...when, when you kissed me

15:15.633 --> 15:18.100
I thought
for just a second

15:18.133 --> 15:20.366
that‐that maybe it wasn't
a "Hello, Balki

15:20.400 --> 15:22.366
how are you today" kiss,

15:22.400 --> 15:26.333
I thought it might
have been a... whatever

15:26.366 --> 15:29.066
"Hi, sailor, new in town?"
kind of a kiss.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.333
Well, you don't feel
bad now, do you, Balki?

15:33.366 --> 15:36.233
Well, of course. Now,
don't be ridiculous.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.300
Well, tell me, um...

15:40.533 --> 15:42.500
...what do you
feel like now?

15:42.533 --> 15:46.100
Well, I feel perfect comfortable
just like I'm home with mama.

15:48.766 --> 15:49.766
[clears throat]

15:51.700 --> 15:53.600
Well, I‐I'm very glad, Balki

15:53.633 --> 15:56.600
because I‐I certainly wouldn't
want you to be afraid of me.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.733
You see,
it's‐it's very rare

15:59.766 --> 16:02.733
for the person such yourself
comes into one's life...

16:02.766 --> 16:07.366
A complete, innocent,
pure and unsullied.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.266
A blank page
upon which someone...

16:10.300 --> 16:13.400
...perhaps someone
like myself...

16:13.433 --> 16:16.233
...can write a tale
of searing passion.

16:18.766 --> 16:19.766
Aw...

16:19.800 --> 16:21.300
No...

16:22.633 --> 16:24.133
Ee‐eh...

16:30.100 --> 16:31.566
M‐mama never did that.

16:33.466 --> 16:35.466
‐ Miss Crawford?
‐ Yes?

16:37.433 --> 16:39.466
Miss Crawford,
Miss Crawford

16:39.500 --> 16:41.566
‐ I‐I don't approve of this.
‐ Oh.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.566
You see, you see,
I‐I‐I come from...

16:45.600 --> 16:46.800
...from a country
where

16:46.833 --> 16:48.633
where, where people believe that

16:48.666 --> 16:50.700
that they should get married
before they do

16:50.733 --> 16:53.433
some of the things that
you and I have already done.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.100
Balki...

16:55.133 --> 16:56.500
Oh...ah!

17:00.700 --> 17:02.066
[keys jingling]

17:10.099 --> 17:11.566
I forgot my library card.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.566
Oh!

17:20.532 --> 17:22.099
What's going on here?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.033
Are you blind?

17:35.233 --> 17:37.500
Don't you have
someplace to go?

17:37.533 --> 17:39.266
No, he doesn't.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.200
Cousin...

17:41.233 --> 17:43.333
...she's all over me
like a wet t‐shirt.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.733
Well, this doesn't seem
like a very good time.

17:49.766 --> 17:52.133
Oh, if I hurry, I can still make
it to the mayor's.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.500
Now, Balki, why don't
we continue this

17:55.533 --> 17:57.533
some other time
in some other place

17:57.566 --> 18:00.600
someplace where we can have,
a little privacy.

18:00.633 --> 18:05.033
What do you say to Mickey's
Hideaway, Tuesday evening?

18:05.066 --> 18:06.633
Mickey's hideaway?

18:06.666 --> 18:08.100
Isn't that
the adult motel

18:08.133 --> 18:10.766
with the waterbeds
and the mirrors and the movies?

18:14.500 --> 18:15.533
I've seen the ads.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.100
Miss Crawford...

18:20.133 --> 18:22.233
...I don't want to hurt
your feelings

18:22.266 --> 18:25.400
but I'm busy Tuesday nights
for the rest of my life.

18:28.533 --> 18:31.433
Balki, let me try
and say this in a way

18:31.466 --> 18:33.500
which even you will understand.

18:34.700 --> 18:37.433
I am Olivia Crawford.

18:37.466 --> 18:39.566
I am an extremely
powerful woman

18:39.600 --> 18:41.100
at The Chronicle.

18:41.133 --> 18:44.200
And, "Goodbye, Olivia,"

18:44.233 --> 18:47.300
means..."Hello, unemployment."

18:49.366 --> 18:51.733
You can't get away
with this.

18:51.766 --> 18:55.066
You'd be surprised
what I can get away with.

18:56.566 --> 18:57.533
Ciao.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.666
Goodbye, Olivia.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.566
Hello, unemployment.

19:09.766 --> 19:11.500
Don't you worry, buddy.

19:11.533 --> 19:14.666
I'm not going to let you take
this lying down.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.266
Well, you know what I mean.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.233
[instrumental music]

19:29.700 --> 19:31.733
Cousin, do you think
we're doing the right thing?

19:31.766 --> 19:33.666
Yes. We're doing
the right thing.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.033
She can't get away
with sexual harassment.

19:37.066 --> 19:38.800
I don't want you
to lose your job.

19:38.833 --> 19:42.166
Balki, we've built
a very strong case here.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.033
Frank Cublic from classified
lost his job because of her.

19:46.066 --> 19:48.400
So did Tommy Dugan
in security

19:48.433 --> 19:50.700
and Jeff Maxwell
on the loading dock.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.733
This lady has got to be stopped.

19:52.766 --> 19:54.500
And this is the right way
to do it.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.566
When do you think
Olivia will hit the fan?

20:05.566 --> 20:07.266
Any minute now.

20:10.966 --> 20:12.233
Look out, baby.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.400
What do you call this?

20:17.433 --> 20:20.200
It's a copy of a complaint
I sent to the managing editor.

20:20.233 --> 20:22.066
We're charging you
with sexual harassment.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.766
[laughs]
You're bluffing.

20:28.033 --> 20:31.600
I carried it up to him
in my very own muscular arms.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.000
Well...

20:35.033 --> 20:37.366
...it's not going
to work, you know.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.600
Oh, Olivia,
I'm glad you're here.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.366
Appleton,
I read your memo.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.900
You make some very damaging
allegations in here.

20:48.933 --> 20:50.833
Everything I wrote
is true.

20:50.866 --> 20:53.033
I even have photocopies of the
registration cards

20:53.066 --> 20:54.833
from Mickey's Hideaway.

20:54.866 --> 20:56.700
Miss Crawford has a suite
named after her.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.400
And if you don't believe him

21:03.433 --> 21:06.133
you can dust my body
for her fingerprints.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.666
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

21:10.866 --> 21:12.866
Olivia, what do you
have to say about this?

21:13.266 --> 21:14.266
Wha...

21:17.266 --> 21:19.066
I mean, look at him!

21:19.100 --> 21:21.766
You don't seriously think
I'd throw myself

21:21.800 --> 21:23.200
at a mail boy, do you?

21:23.233 --> 21:26.700
Three people say they lost
their jobs because of you.

21:26.733 --> 21:29.766
Well, Jack, Jack, Jack.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.033
When people get fired,
they've got to blame somebody.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.333
Now, these kids,
whom I scarcely know

21:35.366 --> 21:36.666
are trying
to slander me.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.233
God knows what I ever did
to them.

21:39.266 --> 21:40.233
I know.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.900
Olivia, give me
a little credit.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.666
I'm a newspaper man.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.833
I checked
Appleton's sources.

21:46.866 --> 21:48.333
And they confirm the rumors

21:48.366 --> 21:50.666
I've been hearing about you
for years.

21:50.700 --> 21:54.200
Now, I'd like to give you
the opportunity... to resign.

21:54.233 --> 21:57.866
Oh, I have no intention
of resigning.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.833
I was hoping
you would say that.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.155
That way I can
say this, you're fired.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.422
That felt good.

22:15.989 --> 22:18.855
What do I need with this two‐bit
paper, anyway?

22:18.889 --> 22:22.155
I think it's time I took a bite
out of the big apple.

22:24.189 --> 22:26.989
No way, lady.
Employees only.

22:33.055 --> 22:35.355
Oh, that does
feel good.

22:37.155 --> 22:40.489
You two should feel
proud of yourselves.

22:40.522 --> 22:41.955
[Jack]
Lot of people wouldn't have
had the guts

22:41.989 --> 22:43.855
to blow the whistle on her.

22:43.889 --> 22:45.889
Weren't you afraid
of losing your jobs?

22:45.922 --> 22:48.422
We decided we'd rather
not work for a newspaper

22:48.455 --> 22:51.022
that would fire it's employees
for telling the truth.

22:51.055 --> 22:53.489
How about that?

22:53.522 --> 22:57.155
I have Woodward and Bernstein
in my basement.

22:57.189 --> 22:58.389
Not bad.

23:00.189 --> 23:01.322
Well, Balki...

23:01.355 --> 23:04.389
...Olivia Crawford didn't get
away with it that time.

23:04.422 --> 23:05.422
Oh, cousin...

23:05.455 --> 23:06.389
[dramatic music]

23:06.422 --> 23:09.855
I‐I'm sorry that means you don't
get an article

23:09.889 --> 23:11.089
in The Sunday Magazine.

23:13.422 --> 23:14.389
You're right.

23:15.955 --> 23:17.089
I won't.

23:17.122 --> 23:21.389
Cousin... don't think I don't
appreciate it because I do.

23:21.422 --> 23:24.222
And the future woman
of my dreams thanks you, too...

23:25.855 --> 23:27.289
...because thanks to you

23:27.322 --> 23:29.155
she'll be able to spend her
wedding night

23:29.189 --> 23:31.089
the way it was meant to be...

23:31.122 --> 23:34.322
...with a husband who has
absolutely no idea

23:34.355 --> 23:35.755
of what he's doing.

23:45.422 --> 23:47.355
[theme music]
