00:15.958 --> 00:17.958
[somber piano theme playing]

00:18.041 --> 00:21.041
[water flowing]

00:21.125 --> 00:22.875
[birds singing]

00:28.083 --> 00:31.583
[seagulls crying]

00:35.916 --> 00:38.875
-Well, I expect it'll cloud over later on.
-[ferryman] Aye.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.250
What's going on at Sutton Hoo, then?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.416
[man] There's a lady
who's got an excavating job.

00:49.125 --> 00:52.125
-Ah, thank you kindly. Mind how you go.
-Thank you.

01:06.708 --> 01:09.416
[birds calling]

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
[music swells]

01:27.208 --> 01:28.250
[sniffles]

01:29.458 --> 01:30.416
[exhales deeply]

01:33.250 --> 01:34.583
[doorbell clicks, rings]

01:39.541 --> 01:42.166
Mornin'. Mrs. Pretty, please.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.250
Basil Brown.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.083
Wait here.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.041
[piano theme fades]

02:06.250 --> 02:08.791
-Should we take a look at them, then?
-[Brown] Right.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.500
Things like this
are usually done through museums.

02:17.541 --> 02:20.333
[Pretty] Yes.
But when I approached Ipswich,

02:20.416 --> 02:22.208
Mr. Reid Moir said
that, with the war coming,

02:22.291 --> 02:24.291
they couldn't embark upon
any new ventures.

02:24.375 --> 02:27.458
[Brown] Well, they have their hands full
with a Roman villa.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.208
-Yes. He said you were working on it.
-[Brown] I am.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.416
He told me you were a difficult man.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.791
[chuckles] Did he, now?

02:34.875 --> 02:38.000
Unorthodox… and untrained.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.125
[Brown] Hmm.
So that's his reference, is it?

02:40.208 --> 02:42.875
[chuckles] Well, I'm… I'm not untrained.

02:42.958 --> 02:46.083
I've been on dig
since I was old enough to hold a trowel.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.375
[sighs] My father taught me.

02:49.875 --> 02:52.458
Perhaps Reid Moir
just wants to keep you for himself.

02:52.541 --> 02:54.916
-[Brown] I don't know about that.
-[both chuckle]

02:55.875 --> 02:59.208
[Brown] I've always had a curiosity
to see these here mounds.

03:00.166 --> 03:03.750
-Henry VIII came here to dig.
-[Pretty] So I'm told.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.208
[Brown] Well, no record of what he found.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.125
[Pretty]
My husband and I bought this land,

03:08.208 --> 03:10.041
with the hope of exploring
what was under there.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.708
-But… Well, best-laid plans.
-[Brown chuckles]

03:14.208 --> 03:16.791
[Pretty] What are they?
Would you hazard a guess?

03:17.291 --> 03:19.291
[Brown] Burial mounds, I expect.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.458
We're standing
in someone's graveyard, I reckon.

03:24.875 --> 03:25.708
Viking…

03:27.958 --> 03:29.208
or maybe older.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.666
Apparently, local girls used to lie down
on them in the hope of falling pregnant.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.625
[Brown chuckles]

03:34.708 --> 03:37.083
I've heard plenty of legends.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.208
Is that why you want to dig, Mrs. Pretty?

03:41.458 --> 03:42.958
Tales of buried treasure?

03:45.750 --> 03:48.000
My interest
in archaeology began like yours,

03:48.083 --> 03:50.250
when I was scarcely old enough
to hold a trowel.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.833
My childhood home
was built on a Cistercian convent.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.791
I helped my father excavate the apse.

03:58.458 --> 03:59.916
That speaks, don't it?

04:01.625 --> 04:02.541
The past.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.458
You have rabbits, Mrs. Pretty.

04:07.541 --> 04:09.958
Yes, I am aware of that. [chuckles]

04:10.041 --> 04:11.500
[Brown] Rabbits burrow.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.250
They're bad for excavations.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.375
I'd like to start with this one.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.625
[Brown] Ah, I wouldn't start
with this one, Mrs. Pretty,

04:18.708 --> 04:20.250
not personally speaking.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.083
-[Pretty] Why not?
-'Cause that dips in the middle, see?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.041
And the soil feels-- That's compacted.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.000
Thieves used to sink shafts in.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.416
Robber's flutes, they're called.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.166
Anything they found
would've been melted down

04:36.250 --> 04:37.708
and sold long ago.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.458
I expect you might be better off with…

04:41.250 --> 04:42.166
one of these.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.458
But I have a feeling about this one.

04:45.541 --> 04:47.250
[Brown]
Well, that's your money, Mrs. Pretty,

04:47.333 --> 04:48.958
but I'd base your dig on evidence,

04:49.041 --> 04:50.625
not feeling.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.583
[Pretty] As for money,
would 1 pound, 15 shillings,

04:56.666 --> 04:58.333
and 6 pence a week be acceptable?

04:58.833 --> 04:59.666
Oh…

05:00.416 --> 05:03.875
-No.
-[Pretty] I asked Reid Moir what he pays.

05:03.958 --> 05:06.291
-That was his reply.
-Well, he don't pay enough.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.166
-[footsteps approach]
-[Pretty] All right.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.541
I'm afraid that's all
I can reasonably afford to spend.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.500
-[boy shouting]
-[Brown] Right, then. Understood.

05:12.583 --> 05:16.583
Robert, where did you get that gas mask?
Take it off.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.833
-Sorry, I didn't realize you were--
-This is not a toy.

05:19.916 --> 05:21.375
Robert, this is Mr. Brown.

05:21.875 --> 05:25.333
-Hello there, young man.
-[Robert] Robert Pretty. How do you do?

05:25.416 --> 05:26.333
Who's coming after you?

05:26.416 --> 05:29.250
-Captain Laska and his gangsters.
-[Brown] Oh!

05:29.333 --> 05:33.083
-[Pretty] Mr. Brown is an archaeologist.
-Well, I'm an excavator.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.625
-You've come to dig up the mounds?
-[Brown] Well…

05:36.500 --> 05:38.541
I'm afraid not. Uh, not today.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.500
Excuse me.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.666
[Robert sighs]

05:44.166 --> 05:48.208
-Good luck with your gangsters, Robert.
-[Robert chuckles] Thank you.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.750
[Brown] And you, with your dig, ma'am.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.541
-[wind whistling]
-[birds calling]

06:01.583 --> 06:02.708
[Brown sighs]

06:09.083 --> 06:10.208
Ah, blast.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.750
[car approaching]

06:20.208 --> 06:21.916
[brakes squeak]

06:26.291 --> 06:27.541
-Mr. Brown?
-Yes?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.666
Billy Lyons. Uh, uh, from Mrs. Pretty.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.541
All right.

06:33.791 --> 06:34.666
Hmm.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.916
[sighs, clicks tongue]

06:41.000 --> 06:43.791
[bright orchestral music playing]

06:43.875 --> 06:47.000
Tell her Monday, 8:00 sharp.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.333
[Brown] I won't work
for less than two pound a week.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.125
And it's too far to bike,
if you want a day's digging.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.916
[Pretty] You could lodge with the Lyonses
in the coach house.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.333
Mr. Lyons is my chauffeur,

06:58.416 --> 07:00.416
and Mrs. Lyons
is in charge of the kitchen.

07:01.791 --> 07:05.583
-[Brown sighs] Well, I'll need help.
-[Pretty] I could let you have one man.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.291
[Brown] Two would be better.

07:09.333 --> 07:12.041
[Pretty] I'm glad we could come
to an arrangement after all, Mr. Brown.

07:15.708 --> 07:18.666
John Jacobs and Mr. Spooner
are bringing the shepherd's hut.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.958
I thought it might be useful
in case of inclement weather.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.958
Oh, that's very considerate.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.791
My son Robert
is keen to assist you in any way.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.916
If you find his presence irksome--

07:33.000 --> 07:34.583
Oh, no, no, no. He can come.

07:35.750 --> 07:36.916
You'll start with this one?

07:38.916 --> 07:39.791
[Brown] Yeah.

07:40.958 --> 07:44.291
I reckon we can forget
that larger mound, Mrs. Pretty.

07:44.875 --> 07:48.083
This one here,
that's where we'll find something.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.750
Well, shan't hold you up.
[chuckles softly]

07:54.250 --> 07:55.625
[Brown] Thank you kindly.

08:02.125 --> 08:05.958
If you ask me, the man should leave
Mrs. Pretty's mounds well alone.

08:17.958 --> 08:18.833
[Brown grunts]

08:32.541 --> 08:33.708
[panting]

08:42.958 --> 08:44.958
[seagulls crying]

08:57.791 --> 09:00.250
-[maid] Thank you, ma'am.
-[Pretty] Great, dear. Thank you.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.958
Darling, please be gentle.
You'll knock me down.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.375
[Robert]
I'm sorry. Mr. Brown says to come.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.583
-Now?
-[Robert] Yes.

09:10.708 --> 09:11.958
Well, thank you for the message.

09:12.041 --> 09:15.666
Well, it looks like the kind of tray
you get at a butcher's.

09:15.750 --> 09:20.166
And there's some blackness here,
maybe indicating a fire was made.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.458
Who are those men?

09:22.041 --> 09:25.208
[Pretty] They're from the Ipswich Museum.
Mr. Reid Moir telephoned me.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.083
He wanted to see how things
were progressing, so I invited him.

09:28.166 --> 09:32.208
Mrs. Pretty,
this is Guy Maynard, our new curator.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.666
-How do you do?
-[Pretty] Hello.

09:33.750 --> 09:34.583
Hello, Brown.

09:34.666 --> 09:38.000
Maynard. Can I borrow you,
please, for this here corner?

09:38.666 --> 09:39.500
Jolly good.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.333
[Brown] One.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.500
-You have it? Two.
-[Maynard] Yeah.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
-[Brown] Three! Blast.
-[Maynard grunts]

09:48.791 --> 09:50.333
Is that the sum of your labors?

09:52.791 --> 09:53.833
[Brown] Excuse me.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.375
[tool clatters]

10:02.041 --> 10:04.041
[somber orchestral music playing]

10:10.083 --> 10:12.916
[indistinct chatter]

10:13.750 --> 10:18.041
[Reid Moir] I must urge you, Mrs. Pretty,
to support our Roman villa.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.291
War is looming.

10:19.375 --> 10:23.083
All hands are on deck
to excavate before hostilities begin.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.125
And so,
we must ask you to return Mr. Brown.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.333
I'd like him to finish what he's started.

10:30.416 --> 10:34.083
[Reid Moir chuckles] We may have found
the largest Roman villa

10:34.166 --> 10:35.166
north of Felixstowe.

10:35.250 --> 10:39.458
It's of far greater import,
if… if you'll forgive me, than this…

10:40.083 --> 10:41.083
minor venture.

10:42.291 --> 10:45.166
-Then the choice is Mr. Brown's.
-Excuse me.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.416
Time had altered that piece of wood

10:48.500 --> 10:49.833
to compacted sand.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.583
I didn't guess its age correctly.

10:53.208 --> 10:56.166
I speculated Viking,
but I think that's older.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.583
-Anglo-Saxon.
-That's most unlikely, Brown.

10:59.666 --> 11:03.458
We should-- We need you back at the villa.
That's what I'm here to say, and…

11:03.541 --> 11:05.875
and Mrs. Pretty has released you.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.833
I have said it is your choice.

11:10.666 --> 11:11.958
Well, then I'll stay.

11:12.791 --> 11:14.250
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

11:16.791 --> 11:17.625
Excuse me.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.250
Now, look here, Brown.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.583
You've made your point.
You can have two pounds a week.

11:21.666 --> 11:23.375
We'll give you a few days
to finish off here,

11:23.458 --> 11:25.708
and then,
as we're the only museum in the area,

11:25.791 --> 11:28.500
I'd carefully consider
where your future lies.

11:32.041 --> 11:32.875
Understood.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.375
[Robert] Mr. Brown's been telling us
all sorts of things.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.833
For instance,
what's the most important part

11:37.916 --> 11:39.375
of an archaeologist's body?

11:39.458 --> 11:42.208
-I don't know.
-[clock chiming]

11:42.291 --> 11:43.250
His nose.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.833
If there's something there,
he'll know it by the smell.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.208
You're going to see your father
this afternoon?

11:58.375 --> 12:00.500
I… I'm afraid I'm needed here.

12:01.333 --> 12:05.416
-Um, please, may I get down?
-If you're quite sure you've finished.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.541
[sighs deeply]

12:13.625 --> 12:16.291
[somber piano music playing]

12:23.916 --> 12:26.333
[takes a deep breath]

12:32.833 --> 12:35.208
[indistinct chatter]

12:35.291 --> 12:39.416
[soldiers clamoring, muffled]

13:28.666 --> 13:30.083
[Pretty sighs]

13:32.375 --> 13:35.041
[breathing heavily]

13:36.375 --> 13:37.541
[man] Boiled beef…

13:38.500 --> 13:42.125
on a hot day like this is unlikely
to agree with anyone, Mrs. Lyons.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.208
[Pretty] It was exactly like last time.

13:45.291 --> 13:49.916
[doctor] Mrs. Pretty, you produce
all this acid because you're a worrier.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.625
We've spoken on this subject before.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.708
-You must learn to stop worrying.
-[sighs]

13:56.791 --> 13:59.458
[doctor]
Otherwise, you'll give yourself an ulcer.

13:59.958 --> 14:02.583
-Well… if that's what you think.
-[doctor] Mm-hmm.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.291
[clock ticking]

14:21.458 --> 14:23.458
[gentle piano music playing]

14:45.291 --> 14:47.291
[grass rustling]

14:50.625 --> 14:52.500
[insects chirping]

15:21.375 --> 15:24.541
Oh, you don't wanna be down there,
Mrs. Pretty. That ain't safe.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.083
Spooner and John Jacobs
are making supports.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.375
We can't continue without them now.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.416
I was reading Howard Carter's account

15:32.500 --> 15:35.000
of his excavation
of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

15:35.083 --> 15:35.916
[Brown] Oh?

15:38.833 --> 15:41.625
He stood at the threshold
of the burial chamber,

15:42.208 --> 15:45.125
the first man to do so for 3,000 years,

15:45.208 --> 15:48.375
and he saw finger marks
still on the paint.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.666
He say, "Time lost its meaning."

15:56.000 --> 15:59.500
It occurs to me
that you might unearth human remains.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.833
[Brown] Yeah, that's possible.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.333
[Pretty]
We're digging down to meet the dead.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.250
Disinterring them, in fact.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.416
[Brown] There's always coroner's inquests
when remains are found.

16:13.125 --> 16:17.750
The dead still get that courtesy,
no matter how many centuries they've lain.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.958
We can't dig down into the earth
without considering that--

16:22.041 --> 16:22.875
Oh!

16:22.958 --> 16:24.708
-[soil rustles]
-[sound muffles]

16:29.916 --> 16:31.166
[Pretty, muffled] Brown?

16:34.291 --> 16:36.291
-[soil shifting]
-[Pretty gasps]

16:38.500 --> 16:39.875
Mr. Brown?

16:42.041 --> 16:45.416
Spooner! Jacob! Get help!

16:46.291 --> 16:49.208
-[sound fades]
-[tense orchestral music playing]

17:22.958 --> 17:25.541
[orchestral music swells]

17:28.583 --> 17:30.250
[man] There! There! There!

17:31.958 --> 17:32.875
Come on, Basil!

17:33.958 --> 17:36.166
[group clamoring indistinctly]

18:00.541 --> 18:02.166
[Pretty cries out indistinctly]

18:19.750 --> 18:21.708
[Pretty] Careful with his head.

18:21.791 --> 18:23.708
[group grunting]

18:23.791 --> 18:26.208
[tense orchestral music continues playing]

18:32.708 --> 18:34.958
[Pretty] Mr. Brown! Mr. Brown!

18:35.041 --> 18:36.291
Mr. Brown!

18:47.583 --> 18:48.791
Mr. Brown?

18:51.208 --> 18:52.500
[sputters]

18:52.583 --> 18:54.750
-[Pretty] That's it.
-[Jacobs] That's it.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.708
-[Brown gasps]
-Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.208
-[groans]
-[Pretty breathing shakily]

19:04.291 --> 19:07.958
You're all right now.
You're all right. You're all right.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.416
[sighs, chuckles] You're all right.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.250
Into the library, Grateley.
Lay him on the sofa.

19:18.541 --> 19:20.875
[somber piano music playing]

19:31.041 --> 19:32.625
[sighs tremulously]

19:35.041 --> 19:36.583
[Pretty] Did you see something?

19:38.958 --> 19:39.833
[Brown] See something?

19:41.041 --> 19:42.166
When you were gone.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.291
Oh…

19:46.083 --> 19:48.000
Something did come into my head.

19:48.875 --> 19:49.875
What was it?

19:50.791 --> 19:53.958
[clicks tongue] My, uh… my grandfather.

19:55.916 --> 19:57.000
I have his name.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.416
Basil Brown.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.083
Farming man.

20:03.791 --> 20:06.583
Taught me everything I know
about Suffolk soil.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.166
And you saw him?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.791
[Brown] Oh, I saw nothing at all.
I was just…

20:13.583 --> 20:16.875
I just thought of him. [sighs]

20:18.000 --> 20:21.916
Well… perhaps he saw you.
[chuckles softly]

20:22.000 --> 20:24.250
-Excuse me.
-Mr. Brown, are you all right?

20:24.333 --> 20:25.333
[Pretty] Mr. Brown!

20:26.291 --> 20:27.916
Mr. Brown, you have to rest!

20:28.000 --> 20:32.375
See, Mrs. Pretty…
this one is the one you like.

20:32.458 --> 20:35.416
It's the one you wanted me to start on.
It's oval.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.375
Like a hog's back.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.000
[both panting]

20:40.083 --> 20:44.541
-See? All the others, circular.
-Yes.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.083
Now,
this land's been plowed for 1,000 year.

20:48.416 --> 20:51.458
Now, supposing whoever plowed here…

20:52.458 --> 20:54.166
gradually knocked a bit off.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.125
So, by the time robbers come along,

20:56.208 --> 20:59.625
they'd have sunk the flute
into what they thought was the center.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.041
-[Pretty] But it might not have been.
-[Brown] That's right.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.250
East to west, that's my feeling.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.208
[chuckles] You say the word…

21:09.208 --> 21:10.708
[laughs]

21:11.625 --> 21:13.333
…and I'll dig.

21:13.416 --> 21:15.000
[Pretty chuckles]

21:16.958 --> 21:19.833
[energetic instrumental music playing]

21:42.375 --> 21:45.125
[Robert] My plane crashed
into the Arctic waste, you see.

21:45.708 --> 21:49.375
And when I woke up, 500 years had passed.

21:49.458 --> 21:53.250
-So, now I'm stuck in the 25th century.
-[Brown] What's that like, then?

21:53.333 --> 21:55.541
Well,
the Earth is controlled by Killer Kane,

21:55.625 --> 21:57.083
who's an extremely evil man.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.250
[Brown] Like Hitler?

21:58.333 --> 22:01.083
[chuckles]
Yes, with an even worse mustache.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.000
Did the people

22:02.083 --> 22:04.583
who made these burial mounds
have mustaches?

22:04.666 --> 22:05.791
[Brown] And beards.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.458
They were a very beardy lot.

22:08.541 --> 22:12.083
Not like them there Romans.
Now, they liked the close shave.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.958
The Vikings and the space pilots
are the same, really, aren't they?

22:16.458 --> 22:19.791
They explore new lands
and have battles in ships.

22:19.875 --> 22:25.250
Yeah, when you put it like that,
I suppose they might be the same.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.500
[warplanes roaring]

22:27.583 --> 22:31.000
[Robert] They come over all the time.
There's an RAF base nearby.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.166
[imitates weaponry firing]

22:35.791 --> 22:37.708
Would you like to fly, Mr. Brown?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.041
[Brown] Oh, but I do.

22:39.625 --> 22:43.833
All over the cosmos,
every time I look through my telescope.

22:44.583 --> 22:45.958
You… You have a telescope?

22:46.041 --> 22:48.375
-I do.
-[Robert] Did you bring it with you?

22:48.458 --> 22:49.625
[Brown] I did.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.375
Well, will you show me?

22:52.541 --> 22:53.500
I might.

22:53.583 --> 22:54.916
[Robert chuckles softly]

22:56.166 --> 22:57.833
[imitates weaponry firing]

22:58.333 --> 23:00.583
Cor! He likes to natter, he does.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.916
What was all that about space travel?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.791
[Robert panting]

23:05.875 --> 23:08.333
[maid]
Mr. Brown had an awful lot of books.

23:08.833 --> 23:11.333
Came on his bike
with a great parcel of them.

23:11.916 --> 23:13.875
Sloan says some are in Norwegian.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.916
Shall we try the green silk?

23:16.416 --> 23:18.666
-It's an old favorite, isn't it?
-[Pretty] No.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.708
The velvet with the lace.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.791
[birds singing outside]

23:32.500 --> 23:34.500
[clock chiming]

23:41.583 --> 23:45.041
[footsteps approach]

23:46.791 --> 23:48.666
[Grateley] Mrs. Lyons hopes it will agree.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.125
[Pretty] How's your leg, Mr. Grateley?

23:51.208 --> 23:54.208
Oh, much better, ma'am.
Thank you for inquiring.

23:55.625 --> 23:56.875
Would you like the wireless?

23:56.958 --> 23:59.666
-[Pretty] Yes, please.
-[clicks on]

23:59.750 --> 24:02.291
[radio announcer] …the Air Guard
under the age of 32

24:02.375 --> 24:04.041
are now being asked to stand by

24:04.125 --> 24:07.125
for further training
as RAF pilots or crew.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.166
[Mrs. Lyons] She's only been here 12 year.

24:09.250 --> 24:12.083
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-Came down from Cheshire.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.875
Then she married the colonel.

24:15.375 --> 24:19.333
He first met with Edith
when she was still at school.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.916
And on his 17th birthday,
he asked her to marry him.

24:23.666 --> 24:25.458
-She turned him down.
-[Billy] Mm.

24:25.541 --> 24:28.333
She say
she can't possibly leave her father.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.791
[Billy grunts softly]

24:31.291 --> 24:36.541
[Mrs. Lyons] She cared for her father
another 13 year, until he died.

24:36.625 --> 24:37.875
[Billy] After 13 years.

24:38.375 --> 24:42.000
[Mrs. Lyons] She finally accepted
the colonel's proposal.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.916
He been asking every year on her birthday.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.125
[Billy] On her birthday.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.250
[Mrs. Lyons] Just after they had Robert…

24:51.208 --> 24:52.958
her husband went and died too.

24:53.041 --> 24:54.708
-[Billy] Mm-hmm.
-[Pretty kisses]

24:56.041 --> 24:57.541
[Mrs. Lyons] Imagine that.

24:57.625 --> 24:59.833
[men laughing]

25:00.583 --> 25:05.250
[chattering indistinctly]

25:05.333 --> 25:07.250
[Brown]
Do any of you want to look through this?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.125
-[man] I thought we'd sit down on that.
-[Brown] You have a go.

25:13.958 --> 25:14.791
That's right.

25:15.625 --> 25:19.041
-[Jacobs] I'm gonna follow you back home.
-[group laughing]

25:19.666 --> 25:21.958
[Brown] Wait! Wait, for Christ's sake!

25:23.541 --> 25:25.500
[seagulls crying]

25:27.458 --> 25:28.416
[exhales]

25:28.916 --> 25:30.166
[Brown] Come on.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.333
[grunts]

25:31.416 --> 25:33.541
[church bell ringing]

25:33.625 --> 25:35.500
[ship horn blows]

25:35.583 --> 25:37.666
[seagulls crying]

25:37.750 --> 25:39.625
-[bicycle bell rings]
-[brakes squeak]

25:40.291 --> 25:42.291
[Brown panting]

25:43.041 --> 25:44.916
[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

25:45.000 --> 25:49.916
They found an iron rivet
at the burial mound at Snape, didn't they?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.208
[Maynard] Snape?
Basil, what have you found?

25:56.375 --> 25:57.750
My goodness, Basil.

26:01.125 --> 26:04.041
-[Spooner] Right. Any joy, Basil?
-[Brown] Coming along together.

26:04.625 --> 26:07.500
Mr. Spooner, will you bring
my tape measure from the hut?

26:07.583 --> 26:09.666
One of you best get Mrs. Pretty down here.

26:09.750 --> 26:13.375
-[Jacobs] She's gone up to London.
-She what? How long?

26:13.458 --> 26:16.041
[Jacobs] London, with Robert.
Couple of days.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.958
[sighs] Blast.

26:19.166 --> 26:22.083
Right, boys. Here we go. Come on together.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.541
Better have something to show
Mrs. Pretty when she get back.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.416
-[knocking on door]
-[Grateley] And the crystal glasses!

26:29.458 --> 26:31.208
No, no, no. Side door, please.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.416
-Mrs. Pretty back from London yet?
-Mrs. Pretty's about to dine.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.833
[Brown] I told you it was urgent.

26:35.916 --> 26:38.833
[Grateley] Mr. Brown, I'm sure
you wouldn't like to interfere with--

26:38.916 --> 26:40.583
[Pretty] It's all right, Mr. Grateley.

26:41.083 --> 26:44.041
-Is it Mr. Brown?
-[Pretty] Yes, darling. Darling

26:46.541 --> 26:48.541
I think you'd better come and see.

26:49.333 --> 26:51.333
[soaring orchestral music playing]

27:06.250 --> 27:07.416
[Brown] That's a ship.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.041
[Robert] How do you mean, a ship?

27:11.791 --> 27:14.916
[Brown] Oh, well, that's a ship
that's been buried in the mound.

27:15.958 --> 27:18.375
[Robert]
Why would anyone want to bury a ship?

27:18.458 --> 27:21.083
[Brown] Well,
I expect because that's a grave.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.375
[Robert] Whose grave?

27:23.875 --> 27:27.041
[Brown] Well, I'd expect
this is a grave of a… a great man.

27:27.791 --> 27:28.791
A warrior…

27:30.125 --> 27:31.208
or a king.

27:31.958 --> 27:37.125
They must have pulled his ship all the way
up that there hill from the river.

27:38.125 --> 27:42.208
Now, they'd have put it on ropes,
and they'd have hauled it over logs.

27:42.916 --> 27:47.083
Men, horses. It must have taken
hundreds of 'em. [chuckles]

27:47.166 --> 27:50.500
I don't expect them to go
to all this trouble for any little squirt.

27:51.208 --> 27:54.208
Can you imagine
the send-off they'd be giving him?

27:54.875 --> 27:57.500
The songs they'd be singing. [laughs]

27:57.583 --> 27:59.958
They'd have drunk Mr. Spooner
under the table.

28:00.041 --> 28:01.833
-[Brown and Pretty laugh]
-[Robert] Vikings?

28:01.916 --> 28:04.375
[sniffles] Well, I… I think that's older.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.791
Maynard disagrees,
but I think it's Anglo-Saxon.

28:08.458 --> 28:12.250
Now, this is your doing, John Jacobs,
'cause you found the first rivet.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.041
-[Jacobs chuckles]
-That's right, Mrs. Pretty. He did.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.791
Congratulations, Mr. Brown.

28:18.875 --> 28:21.666
[Brown chuckles] Well, you thought
there was something, didn't you?

28:21.750 --> 28:23.250
I had my feeling.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.750
That you did, Mrs. Pretty. That you did.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.208
[Pretty] Oh, John.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.583
-Congratulations, Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Thank you, ma'am.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.625
[Brown] We couldn't have done it
without this young man here.

28:34.375 --> 28:35.625
[kisses] Psst.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.791
[softly] Robert, a ship!

28:38.916 --> 28:39.791
[kisses]

28:40.916 --> 28:42.416
[Robert] Thank you. Mr. Brown.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.916
[Brown] Well,
there's a lot of earth to… to shift now.

28:47.166 --> 28:48.250
But who knows?

28:49.333 --> 28:51.791
I'm pretty sure it continues further.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.250
[music and sound fade]

29:10.916 --> 29:13.333
[wind blows softly]

29:20.125 --> 29:21.250
[hatch squeaks]

29:22.875 --> 29:24.083
[man] Evening.

29:24.666 --> 29:25.666
Evening.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.208
[birds singing]

29:36.958 --> 29:38.666
[Reid Moir]
Do you realize what this means?

29:39.166 --> 29:41.125
It's going to change everything
for Ipswich.

29:41.625 --> 29:44.333
We'll be the envy
of every museum in the country.

29:47.333 --> 29:50.583
-You're gonna get wet, Mrs. Pretty.
-[Pretty] I'm afraid I already am.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.208
[Brown grunts]

29:54.291 --> 29:57.541
[Pretty] Mr. Reid Moir has kindly offered
to take charge of the dig.

29:59.583 --> 30:01.750
I turned his generous offer down.

30:02.541 --> 30:04.083
-You didn't.
-[Pretty] I did.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.583
[chuckles, splutters] What did he say?

30:07.166 --> 30:10.375
He said I couldn't keep it to myself,
which is true.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.708
[chuckling] I bet he blew his gasket.

30:12.791 --> 30:15.791
In the meantime, I've asked my cousin,
Rory Lomax, to come.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.833
-[Brown] Right.
-I can see you need another pair of hands.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.541
He's only an amateur,
but then, so is Mr. Reid Moir.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.666
-[both chuckle]
-[thunder rumbling]

30:23.750 --> 30:26.583
-Mrs. Pretty, you better go in the shed.
-Oh, yes.

30:26.666 --> 30:29.208
-[Brown] You're gonna get very wet here.
-[Pretty] I will.

30:31.875 --> 30:33.875
[soothing instrumental music playing]

30:37.291 --> 30:38.375
[Brown sighs]

30:42.708 --> 30:44.250
[Brown panting]

30:44.333 --> 30:47.916
[Pretty] I wanted to thank you
for your patience with Robert.

30:48.416 --> 30:50.333
He can hardly wait to see you
in the mornings.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.916
[Brown] Well, keeps me on me toes,
having him around.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.625
Do you have children?

30:56.291 --> 30:58.916
No, uh, we, uh…

31:03.625 --> 31:04.708
No.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.250
[Brown sniffles]

31:09.166 --> 31:11.583
[Pretty] The servants tell me
you've studied everything,

31:11.666 --> 31:13.208
from Latin to geology.

31:13.791 --> 31:16.833
[Brown] Well, a little education
is a dangerous thing.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.916
[Pretty] Hmm.
Apparently, you've written a book.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.041
[Brown] I have.

31:20.666 --> 31:23.708
A guide to astronomical maps and charts,

31:24.208 --> 31:27.500
to make them accessible to ordinary men.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.750
[Brown] I left school when I was 12.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.750
Always had a hunger to study.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.541
[Pretty] I got a place
at London University.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.458
My father wouldn't hear of it.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.666
[birds singing]

31:56.750 --> 31:58.291
Would you have dinner with me?

32:00.250 --> 32:03.583
Well… thank you. Yes.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.000
[Pretty exhales]

32:26.041 --> 32:27.166
[Brown] Evening, Vera.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.875
Surprise for you, Basil, in your room.

32:31.875 --> 32:32.708
[Brown] Right.

32:40.041 --> 32:40.958
May.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.625
I brought you some fresh shirts.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.333
-[Brown chuckles]
-About time, I say.

32:50.625 --> 32:53.208
-Are you pleased to see me?
-Of course I am.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.125
[sighs, chuckles softly]

32:55.208 --> 32:58.666
-You didn't know I was coming, did you?
-[Brown] No. No, I didn't.

32:59.416 --> 33:00.583
I did tell you.

33:01.625 --> 33:03.000
In my last letter.

33:04.708 --> 33:07.250
[Brown] Oh,
I was saving them for the weekend.

33:07.333 --> 33:10.083
I've been working every hour.
You know what I'm like. [chuckles]

33:10.166 --> 33:12.750
Yes… I do.

33:16.458 --> 33:17.666
[Brown] I'm very busy.

33:17.750 --> 33:21.291
-It looks like it. Nowhere to sit in here.
-[Brown] There's a lot going on here.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.708
-What's that?
-I said there's nowhere to sit down.

33:23.791 --> 33:26.166
[Brown] Yeah. Sorry about that.
It's all-- So much going on.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.166
You got something to show me?
I think you have.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.708
I can see it in your eyes.

33:29.791 --> 33:31.208
I'm not saying anything.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.041
[indistinct chatter]

33:33.125 --> 33:35.458
[maid] There's Mr. Brown with a woman.

33:38.166 --> 33:41.416
I suppose it's his wife.
You know, she writes to him every day.

33:44.958 --> 33:45.958
[knocking on door]

33:46.041 --> 33:46.916
Come in.

33:50.583 --> 33:53.291
Mr. Brown sends his apologies, ma'am.

33:58.416 --> 34:01.375
That's all. Thank you, Ellen. [sighs]

34:03.708 --> 34:06.458
[Brown] A man could dig the earth
his whole life through

34:06.958 --> 34:09.375
and not find anything
like I've discovered here.

34:09.458 --> 34:12.666
-[May] She's beautiful, all right.
-[Brown] Yeah, she's beautiful.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.541
[May] You'll have to watch your back
with a thing like this.

34:15.625 --> 34:16.625
[Brown] What do you mean?

34:16.708 --> 34:19.916
[May] Everyone's gonna want a piece
of this here ship, and this is your find.

34:20.000 --> 34:20.833
[Brown] Oh, May…

34:20.916 --> 34:23.291
[May] Don't let Ipswich Museum
take your glory.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.833
-[Brown] He's not gonna take--
-[May] Or that lady at the manor.

34:25.916 --> 34:28.416
-She should be upping your wages again.
-[Brown] She's supportive.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.541
-[May] You asked?
-[Brown] I ain't gonna ask for more.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.958
[Brown] Well, she's very, very gracious,
Mrs. Pretty.

34:33.041 --> 34:36.125
[May] Your heart's lost
to this Viking maiden, I can tell.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.125
Innit?

34:39.208 --> 34:42.291
[Brown] Ah, May, you sure you don't want
to stay the night?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.916
I'll miss my lift back.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.583
[Brown] Right, yeah, um…

34:48.291 --> 34:50.916
Well, thanks for coming, May.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.958
[sighs] I do miss you.

34:55.708 --> 34:58.583
-I've been reading your books for company.
-You haven't.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.750
-[May] I have.
-[scoffs]

35:00.833 --> 35:03.041
[laughing] Hell,
it's not much company, is it?

35:03.125 --> 35:06.000
-[May] No, they're hard work, I tell you.
-They are.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.000
[both laughing]

35:08.083 --> 35:10.083
Right. Well,
it's good of you to bring my shirts.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.583
-[May] Yeah.
-[Brown grunts]

35:12.666 --> 35:13.541
All right.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.500
[Brown] I'll read them letters tonight.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.791
-[May] Bye, then.
-[Brown] Bye.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.125
[engine rumbles]

35:22.750 --> 35:24.750
[Brown breathing deeply]

35:32.583 --> 35:35.208
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Brown gasps, sighs]

35:38.458 --> 35:39.708
Blast!

35:39.791 --> 35:41.333
[rain pattering]

35:46.916 --> 35:48.083
Ah!

35:48.166 --> 35:49.625
[groans]

35:51.708 --> 35:54.833
[grunting and panting]

35:58.666 --> 35:59.875
[grunts]

36:01.625 --> 36:03.291
-[strains]
-[young man yelps]

36:03.375 --> 36:04.500
[Brown gasps, grunts]

36:05.208 --> 36:07.250
-Let me help.
-[Brown] Right.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.916
Right, then.
Get around that side and take this tarp.

36:14.541 --> 36:17.791
That's… That's right. That's right.
There's a stake there behind you.

36:18.875 --> 36:19.750
Pull it hard.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.208
[Brown] Where in God's name
did you come from?

36:24.291 --> 36:25.708
[young man] I rode, actually,

36:25.791 --> 36:28.083
on my motorbike from Ipswich. [sniffles]

36:28.166 --> 36:29.625
I'm Rory Lomax.

36:29.708 --> 36:32.333
[Brown] Aye. Did Reid Moir send you?

36:33.208 --> 36:35.458
-From the museum?
-[thunder rumbles]

36:35.541 --> 36:37.416
I'm Edith Pretty's cousin.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.166
She telephoned, asked me to come.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.625
-Said you needed an extra pair of hands.
-All right.

36:41.708 --> 36:45.583
I pointed out my general lack of skill,
but she was undeterred.

36:46.708 --> 36:47.583
Right. Well…

36:47.666 --> 36:51.666
no doubt you'll hear
that my name is Brown. Basil Brown.

36:51.750 --> 36:52.750
[Rory] Good to meet you.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.041
[Brown] Now,
it's gonna be raining for a while,

36:55.125 --> 36:57.375
so go on and take a seat. [sniffles]

36:57.458 --> 37:00.666
I expect you'd, uh, be wet,
coming from Ipswich on a motorbike.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.416
-[Rory] I was, rather.
-[Brown] Yeah.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.708
-[Rory] Just caught me at the end.
-[Brown] Right.

37:04.791 --> 37:07.625
Well, I'll light the stove.
Would you like some tea?

37:07.708 --> 37:09.083
[Rory chuckles] Yes, please.

37:09.166 --> 37:12.875
[Brown] I think we may have found, um,
an old, uh, Anglo-Saxon ship.

37:13.625 --> 37:16.666
When this rain clears tomorrow,
maybe you can see what we're doing.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.833
-Yeah?
-How very exciting.

37:20.333 --> 37:21.750
Yeah, it's all right.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.291
[thunder rumbles]

37:28.958 --> 37:31.208
-[Jacobs] Not gonna cover it.
-[Brown] Get the second tarp.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.000
-Pass me the hammer, please.
-[Jacobs] Right.

37:33.583 --> 37:34.625
[Spooner] All right, then.

37:35.833 --> 37:36.708
[Brown] Lift up.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.958
-[panting]
-[Brown] That's right.

37:39.041 --> 37:41.916
[indistinct chatter]

37:45.208 --> 37:46.125
Rory!

37:47.041 --> 37:48.208
Hello, Spud.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.333
[grunts] Arrived in the night.
Didn't want to wake you.

37:51.416 --> 37:52.333
Where's your mother?

37:52.416 --> 37:55.541
-[steam engine approaching]
-[Robert] Oh, she's gone to London.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.041
[train whistle blows]

37:57.125 --> 38:00.333
[passengers clamoring]

38:04.458 --> 38:06.666
[somber piano music playing]

38:13.791 --> 38:16.166
[man] Who knows
if we'll still be alive in a year?

38:19.708 --> 38:23.250
[announcer on loudspeaker]
The yellow and green balls denote gas.

38:23.333 --> 38:26.125
-Red denotes high explosives.
-[children laughing]

38:26.208 --> 38:29.166
[announcer]
Red stripes are incendiary bombs.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.708
If you are caught on the streets
during an air raid,

38:32.791 --> 38:37.333
you must know the appropriate response
to each form of attack.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.708
No, don't throw them about!

39:01.958 --> 39:03.958
[Pretty] I was rushing
to get here on time.

39:05.666 --> 39:07.416
Might that have affected the results?

39:08.541 --> 39:12.333
[doctor] Possibly, but the,
uh, underlying condition is there.

39:12.416 --> 39:15.750
The pneumatic fever
you had as a child, it, uh,

39:15.833 --> 39:17.833
damaged the valves of your heart.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.875
Irreparably, I'm afraid.

39:20.583 --> 39:23.958
Another attack
is likely to be much… more serious.

39:25.375 --> 39:26.666
Possibly even fatal.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.791
-Is there nothing else that can be done?
-[doctor] I'm sorry. I… I…

39:30.875 --> 39:32.375
I wish I had better news.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.958
[continues speaking indistinctly]

39:51.708 --> 39:52.916
[Pretty sighs deeply]

40:00.083 --> 40:02.541
[somber piano music swells]

40:02.625 --> 40:05.708
[bells tolling]

40:28.666 --> 40:31.250
[indistinct chatter]

40:59.833 --> 41:00.791
[parking brake clicks]

41:01.375 --> 41:03.958
[Grateley] Mr. Reid Moir is here, ma'am,
with some other gentlemen.

41:04.041 --> 41:05.791
They wouldn't stop to give me their names.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.625
Then they're trespassing. Where are they?

41:07.708 --> 41:09.708
-On their way to the mounds.
-Fetch them, quickly.

41:09.791 --> 41:12.166
-Right.
-[Pretty] Lyons?

41:16.083 --> 41:17.125
[sighs]

41:18.750 --> 41:21.500
[Brown] Now, I've been reading up
about the Oseberg Ship.

41:21.583 --> 41:24.375
That's a Viking ship they found in Norway.

41:24.875 --> 41:28.583
There was a burial chamber
in the center, roofed.

41:28.666 --> 41:31.250
It's a bit like we imagine Noah's Ark.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.833
Course, any roof here
would have caved in long ago.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.750
See, this line here.

41:37.833 --> 41:41.416
The ground is higher,
but this soil is darker.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.500
So you think there's something beneath?

41:44.291 --> 41:47.791
Well, we may know by the end of today.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.416
Ye gods!

41:51.250 --> 41:52.625
This is incredible!

41:53.125 --> 41:56.333
[Reid Moir] We at the Ipswich Museum
pride ourselves on our work,

41:56.416 --> 42:00.041
and I… I think you'll agree
that it's rock solid.

42:00.125 --> 42:03.458
-[Brown] You… You need to stop there.
-I beg your pardon?

42:03.541 --> 42:05.791
This is a very delicate site,
and it ain't safe.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.708
Uh, not for a man of your size.

42:10.291 --> 42:11.166
Is this your work?

42:11.250 --> 42:14.625
Uh, yes. I'm Basil Brown, excavator.

42:16.833 --> 42:20.375
[clears throat]
Well, Basil Brown, excavator…

42:21.166 --> 42:24.083
I am Charles Phillips, archaeologist,

42:24.833 --> 42:27.416
and I'm here to tell you that,

42:27.500 --> 42:30.458
as this is a find of national interest,

42:30.541 --> 42:33.791
the British Museum will be taking charge.

42:34.458 --> 42:35.458
Your work…

42:36.583 --> 42:38.541
looks, thankfully, decent,

42:39.333 --> 42:42.791
but your excavating service
is no longer required.

42:42.875 --> 42:47.166
Am… Am I to understand
that you will be personally taking over?

42:47.791 --> 42:50.791
Grimes,
I have never seen anything like it.

42:50.875 --> 42:52.666
-Quite, sir.
-Brailesford.

42:52.750 --> 42:55.416
-Sir.
-[Phillips] Cancel everything I've got.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.458
Find out who's free. We need Piggott.

42:58.541 --> 43:01.208
-Find us lodgings, as near as you can.
-[Brailesford] Yes, sir.

43:01.708 --> 43:04.583
[Reid Moir] That dark soil in the middle,
C.W., looks very promising.

43:04.666 --> 43:08.250
You men, finish up,
and don't move another pebble!

43:08.333 --> 43:09.708
[Brown] Excuse me, Mr. Phillips.

43:09.791 --> 43:13.000
[splutters] I'm not employed by you.

43:13.083 --> 43:15.125
I'm employed by Mrs. Pretty,

43:15.208 --> 43:18.083
and I'll keep on working
until she tells me different.

43:18.166 --> 43:23.166
An ad hoc team from a provincial museum
cannot be left in charge.

43:23.875 --> 43:26.250
Mrs. Pretty must see that.

43:29.708 --> 43:30.833
[lock clicks]

43:30.916 --> 43:31.916
[doorbell ringing]

43:32.000 --> 43:35.541
John, a minute is all I need.
I… I know she'll want to hear this.

43:35.625 --> 43:37.958
-All right, all right. Wait here.
-Right.

43:41.250 --> 43:42.750
[muttering softly]

43:43.833 --> 43:46.500
[Grateley] She'll see you tomorrow morning
at 10:30.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.375
She must know what I found.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.708
-[Grateley] Don't push it, old boy!
-[Brown] She must know!

43:50.791 --> 43:51.791
-[slams]
-[Brown] John!

43:52.375 --> 43:55.000
[door rattles, creaks open]

43:55.083 --> 43:56.333
[door closes]

43:56.416 --> 44:00.000
-Is he gone, Mr. Grateley?
-[Brown] It's not Grateley.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.541
[Pretty gasps]

44:01.625 --> 44:04.875
I… I'm sorry for disturbing you,
but I believe…

44:05.625 --> 44:08.625
we may have found
a burial chamber in the ship.

44:10.666 --> 44:14.041
-Does Mr. Phillips know?
-[Brown] I don't work for Mr. Phillips.

44:14.125 --> 44:15.458
What are your wishes?

44:21.125 --> 44:25.041
I, uh… He just informed me that,
by order of the Ministry of Works,

44:25.125 --> 44:27.250
the site must be placed under his control.

44:31.916 --> 44:33.083
Well, uh… [sighs]

44:34.833 --> 44:35.916
…that's that, then.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.416
[sound fading]

44:37.500 --> 44:40.208
[Brown, muffled] Well, I…
I can carry on for one more day…

44:40.708 --> 44:41.875
if that's what you'd like.

44:41.958 --> 44:43.875
[somber instrumental music playing]

44:46.291 --> 44:48.458
Are… Are you poorly, Mrs. Pretty?

44:50.250 --> 44:51.500
Um… [sighs]

44:53.458 --> 44:54.791
Perhaps you might, um…

44:55.791 --> 44:57.208
might ring the bell for me.

44:57.958 --> 44:58.791
Right.

44:59.291 --> 45:00.500
[bell rings]

45:01.000 --> 45:03.083
He's got no right to dictate to you.

45:03.583 --> 45:05.750
This ship's only appearing because of you.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.708
Don't forget why you wanted it begun.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.958
Now, you said that was a feeling.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.875
Your feeling is right.

45:12.958 --> 45:14.166
[door creaks open]

45:17.166 --> 45:20.875
-Mr. Brown seems to have found his way in.
-[Grateley] Mr. Brown.

45:26.750 --> 45:27.625
All right.

45:33.166 --> 45:35.166
[Pretty breathing shakily]

45:36.541 --> 45:38.416
[Grateley] Is there anything
I could bring you?

45:38.500 --> 45:39.958
Fetch Ellen for me, please.

45:43.916 --> 45:45.416
[sighs deeply]

45:54.916 --> 45:56.125
[sniffles]

45:57.833 --> 45:59.833
[somber music swells]

46:23.083 --> 46:24.083
[lighter clicks]

46:27.166 --> 46:28.500
[Pretty sighs]

46:32.333 --> 46:33.500
[exhales deeply]

46:43.708 --> 46:45.708
[wind whistles]

47:01.083 --> 47:03.750
[Phillips]
Mrs. Pretty is keen to keep you on,

47:04.250 --> 47:06.916
so we'll make good use of you.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.166
Your primary task
will be to keep the site in order.

47:10.250 --> 47:15.750
So, I want the tumulus dug back
to an area of four feet on either side,

47:15.833 --> 47:18.708
and I want those spoil heaps removed.

47:19.250 --> 47:20.083
From now on,

47:20.166 --> 47:24.708
you're not to set foot in the body
of the ship without my express permission.

47:24.791 --> 47:25.791
Carry on.

47:26.791 --> 47:28.750
[Jacobs]
Are you gonna put up with that, Basil?

47:38.666 --> 47:39.583
[Brown sighs]

47:47.416 --> 47:48.750
[Robert] Hello, Mr. Brown.

47:49.250 --> 47:53.208
-My mother's got her heartburn.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

47:53.291 --> 47:56.083
She has to have peace and quiet.
I made her this.

47:56.166 --> 47:59.958
-[Brown] Well, that's a very fine rocket.
-Where are you going?

48:00.041 --> 48:02.250
Oh, I… Oh, I have to go home now.

48:02.916 --> 48:04.375
When will you be back?

48:05.750 --> 48:08.166
Well, uh… I'm sorry, Robert. I…

48:09.375 --> 48:10.333
I am.

48:14.333 --> 48:16.041
Uh, but, Mr. Brown…

48:16.541 --> 48:17.791
Mr. Brown!

48:19.375 --> 48:22.416
-Mr. Brown!
-[Rory] It seems I'm out of a job.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.833
[Rory] Phillips won't let us in his ship.

48:26.083 --> 48:28.125
His ship? Really?

48:28.708 --> 48:31.500
I thought I might take some photographs.
It could make a useful record.

48:31.583 --> 48:33.416
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.

48:33.500 --> 48:36.041
-As long as they're not of me.
-[camera clicks]

48:37.125 --> 48:38.750
Can't say I blame Brown.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.125
Such a decent man
doesn't deserve Phillips.

48:42.208 --> 48:43.458
Blame him?

48:43.541 --> 48:45.208
Well, he left this morning.
Didn't you know?

48:46.750 --> 48:47.875
Where's Robert?

48:50.208 --> 48:51.250
[water pours]

48:52.041 --> 48:54.041
[Robert panting]

48:59.250 --> 49:01.000
[horn blares]

49:09.000 --> 49:10.750
You don't have another job?

49:12.500 --> 49:15.416
I'll write to Maynard,
and he'll give me something.

49:17.250 --> 49:19.666
[May]
Did you tell Mrs. Pretty you were leaving?

49:20.166 --> 49:22.375
[Brown]
I thought I'd let her work it out herself.

49:22.458 --> 49:23.625
And that's the thanks she gets

49:23.708 --> 49:25.708
for giving you the opportunity
in the first place?

49:25.791 --> 49:28.708
Mark my words, May,
I won't receive any credit.

49:28.791 --> 49:31.416
-I won't even be a footnote.
-[May] Is that why you took the job?

49:31.500 --> 49:32.833
-For credit?
-How can I stay on?

49:32.916 --> 49:35.416
Is that why you've been digging
your whole life for barely enough

49:35.500 --> 49:36.416
to cover our rent?

49:36.500 --> 49:39.708
No, May. I do it 'cause I'm good at it.

49:39.791 --> 49:42.750
'Cause that's what my father taught me,
and what his father taught him.

49:42.833 --> 49:46.000
'Cause you can show me a handful of soil
from anywhere in Suffolk,

49:46.083 --> 49:48.708
and I can pretty much tell you
whose land it's from.

49:48.791 --> 49:49.791
There you go.

49:51.291 --> 49:53.041
[gentle instrumental music playing]

49:53.791 --> 49:55.916
-[bicycle bell rings]
-[Robert panting]

49:56.416 --> 49:58.958
[Robert] Excuse me.
Do you know Basil Brown?

49:59.041 --> 50:01.250
-Do you know where he lives?
-Yes, I know Basil.

50:01.333 --> 50:03.666
He lives on a farm outside of the village.
Carry on that way.

50:03.750 --> 50:04.875
Thank you so much.

50:11.416 --> 50:12.583
[groans]

50:27.750 --> 50:29.208
I found that ship.

50:31.083 --> 50:35.083
I may not be a fellow at Cambridge,
but I worked out what was down there.

50:35.666 --> 50:39.208
And Jacobs and Spooner, too,
and nobody'll remember that.

50:39.291 --> 50:40.708
You don't know that.

50:41.583 --> 50:43.458
And if you're not around
to see it to the end,

50:43.541 --> 50:44.750
there's even less chance.

50:46.708 --> 50:49.750
You always told me your work
isn't about the past or even the present.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.000
It's for the future.

50:51.708 --> 50:55.541
So that the next generations
can know where they came from.

50:56.583 --> 50:58.833
The line
that joins them to their forebears.

50:58.916 --> 51:00.333
Isn't that what you always say?

51:03.958 --> 51:05.416
Yeah, something like that.

51:05.916 --> 51:08.208
[May] Why else would the lot of you
be playing in the dirt

51:08.291 --> 51:10.708
while the rest of the country
prepares for war?

51:12.291 --> 51:14.791
-Because that means something, innit?
-[Brown sighs]

51:15.750 --> 51:19.416
Something that'll last longer
than whatever damn war we're heading into.

51:24.041 --> 51:25.166
Good hell.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.416
That's Robert.

51:28.291 --> 51:29.791
-Robert?
-[Robert panting]

51:30.291 --> 51:31.875
-[bicycle brakes squeak]
-Robert!

51:32.375 --> 51:33.625
[Robert] Mr. Brown!

51:34.166 --> 51:37.000
[Brown]
Robert, have you cycled all this way?

51:37.083 --> 51:38.083
You promised.

51:38.958 --> 51:39.916
May! May!

51:40.375 --> 51:43.541
You said you'd show me the cosmos.
You promised.

51:43.625 --> 51:46.791
-Good heavens! Who have we here?
-[Brown] This is Robert Pretty.

51:46.875 --> 51:48.166
[May] Robert, I'm Mrs. Brown.

51:49.041 --> 51:51.458
I bet you have a rare thirst
after that long ride, don't you?

51:51.541 --> 51:53.583
-[Robert] Mm-hmm.
-Come you here.

51:53.666 --> 51:55.958
-Let's get you a cup of milk.
-[Brown] That's a long way.

51:56.041 --> 51:57.666
Does your mother know you're here, Robert?

51:57.750 --> 51:59.916
-[May] How'd you find your way?
-She know you cycled?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.541
-[May] Should I take your bike for you?
-[Robert] Yes, please.

52:02.625 --> 52:04.916
I better find a telephone, May.
Call Mrs. Pretty.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.875
[car approaching]

52:15.833 --> 52:16.666
[Brown] Ah.

52:17.625 --> 52:19.583
-[Pretty] Thank you.
-[Brown] He's all right.

52:19.666 --> 52:22.666
-He's inside. Uh, come this way.
-[Pretty] Thank you.

52:22.750 --> 52:25.125
-We were obviously very worried.
-Yes. He's… He's…

52:25.208 --> 52:27.250
Uh, this is May, my wife.

52:27.333 --> 52:29.458
-Mrs. Pretty.
-Thank you very much.

52:30.041 --> 52:32.833
He's been no trouble. A lovely boy.

52:33.375 --> 52:35.458
Mrs. Brown has a music box from Whitby

52:35.541 --> 52:37.666
covered in all manner of shells.

52:37.750 --> 52:38.875
Would you like to see?

52:38.958 --> 52:42.083
Uh, no.
We've imposed on your kindness enough.

52:42.583 --> 52:44.166
What were you thinking?

52:45.291 --> 52:47.125
You could have been lost or killed.

52:47.208 --> 52:51.416
-Robert… what were you thinking?
-[Robert] I'm sorry, Mother.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.875
Uh, Robert came to remind me
of a promise that I made.

52:55.375 --> 52:58.458
I said I'd show him the stars
through my telescope.

52:59.125 --> 53:00.041
Didn't I?

53:00.833 --> 53:02.125
Then you're returning?

53:03.333 --> 53:05.291
I am. Yes.

53:09.958 --> 53:11.416
Thank you. [sighs]

53:22.375 --> 53:23.208
[Rory] Morning!

53:24.000 --> 53:24.875
[Brown] Morning.

53:24.958 --> 53:29.458
Mr. Grimes. I've been, uh… taking notes.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.333
-Ah!
-If they be of any use.

53:32.416 --> 53:34.291
Why, they'd save me days.

53:35.916 --> 53:39.500
-You must have suspected what was here.
-[Brown] Well, you've made good progress.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.166
[Grimes] As did you.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.250
Thank you kindly.

53:43.333 --> 53:46.708
-[Grimes] It's fine work, Mr. Brown.
-[Brown] Yeah. Well, we made a start.

53:47.291 --> 53:50.541
-Phillips.
-[Phillips] Our excavator has returned.

53:50.625 --> 53:51.458
[Brown] Morning.

53:51.541 --> 53:53.541
[Phillips] There's a sign
in the bottom of the ship

53:53.625 --> 53:56.125
that there could be an intact chamber.

53:56.208 --> 53:57.916
[Piggott] Tremendously exciting.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.166
[warplanes roaring overhead]

54:03.625 --> 54:04.791
[Phillips grunts]

54:04.875 --> 54:07.208
[Piggott] What about events
in the wider world, C.W.?

54:07.708 --> 54:09.166
How do you think it will affect us?

54:09.250 --> 54:11.250
[Phillips] Judging by last night's news…

54:12.166 --> 54:14.833
I think we could be at war
in a matter of weeks,

54:15.333 --> 54:18.166
and every excavation
in the land will stop.

54:18.666 --> 54:21.916
-So, it's up to us. [clears throat]
-[Piggott sighs]

54:22.000 --> 54:23.666
-Oh, good lord. [gasps]
-Gosh.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.250
-[Piggott] Jim! Billy Grimes!
-Stuart!

54:28.333 --> 54:30.416
-How the devil are you?
-[Piggott chuckles] Very well.

54:30.500 --> 54:33.625
-This is my wife, Margaret.
-Peggy.

54:33.708 --> 54:35.916
[Brailesford] Mrs. Piggott,
a pleasure to meet you.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.541
[Peggy] Mr. Phillips, I-- um,
I wanted to say how pleased I was

54:39.625 --> 54:41.291
that you specifically asked
for me to come.

54:41.375 --> 54:43.875
I know Stuart sent you my paper
on Bosnian Lake villagers.

54:43.958 --> 54:46.500
It was awfully good of you to read it.

54:48.083 --> 54:50.500
Ah, yes. Um, very stimulating.

54:50.583 --> 54:54.000
[Peggy chuckles] I hope
I'll be able to repay your faith in me.

54:54.083 --> 54:55.458
[Phillips] I have no doubt.

54:55.541 --> 54:58.458
It's just that I haven't done
much actual fieldwork yet.

54:58.541 --> 55:01.833
Uh, so I wouldn't want you to think
I'm more experienced than I really am.

55:01.916 --> 55:04.875
[Phillips]
Ah, you have all the key attributes.

55:05.833 --> 55:06.833
[Peggy] Do I?

55:06.916 --> 55:08.875
-This ship is very delicate.
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm.

55:08.958 --> 55:12.291
One could say, it,
um, scarcely exists at all.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.083
Too much weight, it disintegrates.

55:15.166 --> 55:20.416
You're probably less than nine stone,
so I'll supervise from here

55:20.500 --> 55:23.458
while you light things
get on with the digging.

55:25.666 --> 55:28.208
Am I to understand
you only asked for me because of my size?

55:28.291 --> 55:30.000
Uh, lucky guess, actually.

55:30.500 --> 55:34.041
[chuckles] Yeah, thank God
Piggott didn't marry a piglet.

55:34.125 --> 55:36.583
[group laughs]

55:36.666 --> 55:38.208
[Phillips] Carry on!

55:38.291 --> 55:40.291
[somber instrumental music playing]

55:49.833 --> 55:53.000
-[Phillips] How does it look to you?
-[Brailesford] Sir?

55:54.125 --> 55:56.291
-[camera clicks]
-[crew chattering]

56:00.625 --> 56:02.291
[Phillips] What have you got there?

56:02.375 --> 56:03.458
[camera clicks]

56:06.041 --> 56:10.000
-[seagulls crying]
-[Robert imitating weaponry firing]

56:15.375 --> 56:16.625
[camera clicks]

56:23.000 --> 56:24.291
[Brailesford] All right, then.

56:32.041 --> 56:33.291
[camera clicks]

56:38.083 --> 56:39.500
[indistinct chatter]

56:40.375 --> 56:43.625
-[Piggott] First round's on me, chaps!
-[Phillips] Very nice of you.

56:43.708 --> 56:46.125
[group continues chattering indistinctly]

56:54.666 --> 56:56.000
[Peggy laughing]

56:57.500 --> 56:59.750
[coughs] Do they not have a… a double?

56:59.833 --> 57:02.250
[Piggott] Sorry, darling, no.
This is fine, though, isn't it?

57:02.333 --> 57:05.166
We don't…
We don't want to start by making a fuss.

57:05.250 --> 57:07.000
Oh, no. Of course not.

57:08.541 --> 57:11.375
We're so lucky to be part of this. [sighs]

57:12.208 --> 57:13.041
[Peggy] Yes.

57:13.916 --> 57:17.166
-[exhales] Yes, it's going to be amazing.
-Mm.

57:20.875 --> 57:22.000
[exhales]

57:22.625 --> 57:24.625
Would you prefer this bed…

57:25.791 --> 57:27.291
or… or… or that one?

57:27.375 --> 57:29.250
I'll… I'll take this one, shall I?

57:30.916 --> 57:31.791
[Peggy sighs]

57:33.458 --> 57:37.958
[Brown] You need to find a star
and identify its direction of travel.

57:38.625 --> 57:41.541
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-[Brown] Good evening, Mrs. Pretty.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.583
-Hello, Mother.
-[Pretty] Hello, darling.

57:44.666 --> 57:45.958
Ah!

57:47.125 --> 57:49.625
[Robert]
Do space pilots navigate using the stars?

57:49.708 --> 57:51.583
[Brown] Oh, most certainly, they do.

57:53.916 --> 57:56.916
Ten more minutes, Commander. Then, bed.

57:57.958 --> 57:59.958
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

58:08.500 --> 58:09.750
[Robert] I see a star.

58:11.166 --> 58:13.875
[group singing indistinctly]

58:26.291 --> 58:28.291
[birds singing]

58:31.750 --> 58:32.833
[Brown] All right.

58:34.958 --> 58:37.625
[Peggy grunting]

58:38.333 --> 58:39.500
[screams]

58:39.583 --> 58:41.666
-Oh, God!
-[Phillips] What's going on?

58:41.750 --> 58:44.333
-[Peggy] It just gave way.
-[Phillips] Get her off there!

58:44.416 --> 58:46.916
-Piggott, get her off!
-Oh, I'm so sorry!

58:47.000 --> 58:49.666
-I didn't mean to damage anything.
-[Piggott sighs] Oh, you…

58:49.750 --> 58:52.083
-What you got, Brailesford?
-[Brown] You all right?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
[Brailesford] Sort of rusted lumps.

58:55.083 --> 58:56.916
[Phillips] Come on, man.
Where's your training?

58:57.000 --> 59:00.041
[Brailesford] Uh, an amorphous mass
of corroded objects, sir.

59:00.583 --> 59:03.541
You, get your camera down there.
Photograph it.

59:03.625 --> 59:05.791
That's… That's very hot in the full sun.

59:05.875 --> 59:08.458
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

59:08.958 --> 59:12.250
Watch your step there.
This could well be our chamber.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.958
[Pretty] Some barley water, Mrs. Piggott?

59:15.041 --> 59:18.708
-[sighs] Thank you. So clumsy.
-[Pretty] Oh, not at all.

59:19.666 --> 59:22.125
-[flies buzzing]
-[Peggy exhales] Oh.

59:22.208 --> 59:24.041
-That's a very lovely skirt.
-[Peggy] Oh.

59:24.125 --> 59:28.541
[chuckles] Completely useless.
I don't have anything more suitable.

59:28.625 --> 59:31.083
-We came straight from our holiday.
-Did you really?

59:31.166 --> 59:33.750
-[Peggy chuckles] Yes.
-[Pretty] Well, come to the house.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.916
Let's see what we can find.

59:39.666 --> 59:41.333
Is Mrs. Pretty still poorly?

59:44.125 --> 59:46.833
She says she's perfectly fine, but…

59:47.666 --> 59:49.333
[whispering] …that's typical of her.

59:51.791 --> 59:54.250
[men hollering, laughing]

59:54.333 --> 59:56.041
Damn this weather.

59:57.291 --> 59:59.125
Losing a whole day.

1:00:00.041 --> 1:00:03.791
So little time before world events…

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.208
confound us.

1:00:06.291 --> 1:00:07.916
[men continue laughing]

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.833
[Phillips] It's a race, an absolute race.

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:14.666
[Pretty] Then you are wasting
the talents of Mr. Brown.

1:00:15.791 --> 1:00:17.625
Well, that's an excellent idea.

1:00:18.125 --> 1:00:21.875
Stuart couldn't fault his work.
Could he not be unearthing the stern?

1:00:22.375 --> 1:00:24.416
[Phillips] Mr. Brown isn't qualified.

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:27.625
Well, that's just snobbery,
isn't it, Mr. Phillips?

1:00:30.375 --> 1:00:33.625
[Brailesford and Piggott
chuckling and chatting]

1:00:34.375 --> 1:00:36.000
-[Phillips] Brown!
-[Peggy clears throat]

1:00:37.958 --> 1:00:38.875
[Phillips] Brown!

1:00:40.083 --> 1:00:41.875
Brown, come here, man!

1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:52.750
[footsteps approaching]

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:56.041
[Piggott gasps] Oh my God, Margaret.

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:00.666
[Peggy sighs]

1:01:02.083 --> 1:01:03.291
[exhales]

1:01:03.375 --> 1:01:04.875
Sorry. I forgot to lock the door.

1:01:04.958 --> 1:01:08.416
[chuckles] No, you see,
we… we… we share that bathroom

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:12.500
with… with four other rooms,
and, you know, I could have been anyone.

1:01:12.583 --> 1:01:15.916
-Um, I could've been Grimes or Phillips.
-[Peggy scoffs]

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.500
But you're not. You're my husband.

1:01:17.583 --> 1:01:20.458
[chuckles] Yes,
but how… how do you think I'd feel

1:01:20.541 --> 1:01:22.583
if… if one of them saw you in that state?

1:01:22.666 --> 1:01:26.125
[scoffs] Oh! In what state?

1:01:26.208 --> 1:01:27.875
[laughs]

1:01:27.958 --> 1:01:29.750
[giggles] In this state?

1:01:30.833 --> 1:01:32.625
Christ, I-- Stop.

1:01:32.708 --> 1:01:35.208
You should be more careful. It's…

1:01:35.291 --> 1:01:40.416
You know, now, after… after waiting eons,
I shall… I shall go and have my bath.

1:01:41.708 --> 1:01:44.958
[door opens, closes]

1:01:46.458 --> 1:01:47.458
[Peggy sighs]

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:54.875
[birds chirping]

1:02:06.208 --> 1:02:08.333
-[Grimes] Mr. Spooner.
-[Spooner] Right.

1:02:16.083 --> 1:02:18.541
-Morning, Mr. Piggott.
-[chuckles nervously] C.W.

1:02:21.666 --> 1:02:22.583
[sighs]

1:02:22.666 --> 1:02:26.083
-[whispers] You might have woken me.
-I didn't like to.

1:02:27.333 --> 1:02:28.750
You made me appear late.

1:02:33.625 --> 1:02:37.125
-[Pretty reading indistinctly]
-[crew chattering and laughing]

1:02:38.333 --> 1:02:41.750
[Piggott whispering] Careful, Stuart.
You've got a delicate line now, man.

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:43.458
-Very delicate.
-You ready?

1:02:43.541 --> 1:02:44.791
-Yeah.
-[Phillips] Just a moment.

1:02:44.875 --> 1:02:47.791
You have to be very careful now.
No cavalier lifting.

1:02:47.875 --> 1:02:49.666
[both laughing]

1:02:49.750 --> 1:02:51.125
-[Phillips] Very gently.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:51.208 --> 1:02:55.291
[Phillips] On my count. One, two, three.

1:02:56.041 --> 1:02:57.958
[softly] And we do it this way.

1:03:11.708 --> 1:03:12.750
[Peggy gasps]

1:03:14.958 --> 1:03:16.083
[Rory] Don't move.

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:17.166
[camera clicks]

1:03:19.916 --> 1:03:23.416
-[Peggy breathing shakily]
-[Brailesford] Piggott, look.

1:03:27.125 --> 1:03:29.291
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

1:03:29.875 --> 1:03:33.666
[Piggott] Where did you find it, darling?
You clever girl.

1:03:35.791 --> 1:03:36.791
Phillips!

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:43.333
-Look at this, sir.
-Look. Look!

1:03:44.083 --> 1:03:45.916
-[Phillips] Ah, good Lord.
-[Piggott] His face!

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.333
[crew laughing]

1:03:47.416 --> 1:03:48.416
Phillips.

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:52.125
-Mrs. Pretty, there's more.
-[Brown] And here. And here too.

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:54.541
[Peggy] There's much more.

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:58.250
[energetic instrumental music playing]

1:04:09.041 --> 1:04:11.041
[crew chatting indistinctly]

1:04:28.333 --> 1:04:30.791
[excited chatter]

1:04:30.875 --> 1:04:33.791
[Brown] Could you both, uh,
cast your eyes on this, please?

1:04:34.875 --> 1:04:37.500
I, uh, found it down between the strikes.

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.791
I believe that's a Merovingian tremissis.

1:04:40.875 --> 1:04:43.583
-Late 6th century.
-[Phillips scoffs] Can't be.

1:04:44.416 --> 1:04:48.791
Viking East Anglia didn't have
a coin-based economy till the 9th century.

1:04:48.875 --> 1:04:52.291
[Brown] Well,
I think that the ship is older.

1:04:52.375 --> 1:04:54.000
Mr. Brown has always said so.

1:05:05.333 --> 1:05:06.708
This is Anglo-Saxon.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:10.208
Piggott! Grimes!

1:05:10.291 --> 1:05:12.791
It's Dark Age, by Jupiter!

1:05:12.875 --> 1:05:14.250
Sixth century!

1:05:14.333 --> 1:05:16.583
This changes everything.

1:05:16.666 --> 1:05:20.875
These people
were not just marauding barterers.

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:22.375
They had culture!

1:05:23.125 --> 1:05:24.125
They had art!

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:26.125
They had money!

1:05:26.208 --> 1:05:27.833
[Grimes] Well, Vikings are out the window.

1:05:27.916 --> 1:05:28.750
[Piggott gasps]

1:05:28.833 --> 1:05:30.875
-C.W., look.
-[Peggy] God's sake.

1:05:30.958 --> 1:05:32.208
Oh, good God.

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:34.000
[crew laughing]

1:05:34.083 --> 1:05:38.791
[Phillips] Brown has just shown me
a Merovingian tremissis.

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:40.666
[Piggott exclaims]

1:05:41.416 --> 1:05:43.333
-[crew laughs]
-That's Anglo-Saxon.

1:05:43.416 --> 1:05:45.750
[Phillips] It's incredible!

1:05:51.583 --> 1:05:52.541
[blows]

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:57.041
[camera clicks]

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.500
[birds singing]

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:06.958
[Peggy] Hello.

1:06:07.041 --> 1:06:08.541
Are you camping out here?

1:06:09.708 --> 1:06:12.125
[Robert]
No. That's where my cousin Rory sleeps.

1:06:12.958 --> 1:06:14.583
[Peggy] Is he not allowed indoors?

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:18.458
[Robert] No, he…
he thinks the house is too hot.

1:06:19.083 --> 1:06:22.333
-[Peggy chuckles] I can imagine.
-[Robert] He's going to join the RAF.

1:06:22.875 --> 1:06:25.500
-Is he?
-They're sending his papers any day.

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:27.250
He's going to get his wings.

1:06:27.958 --> 1:06:28.833
Huh.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:37.000
Well done, everybody,
on a splendid effort.

1:06:37.750 --> 1:06:39.208
Brailesford, Piggott,

1:06:39.708 --> 1:06:42.083
if you'll start loading the gold
into the car,

1:06:42.166 --> 1:06:44.083
we'll get it
straight to the British Museum.

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:45.791
[Pretty] I beg your pardon?

1:06:45.875 --> 1:06:47.500
[seagulls crying]

1:06:47.583 --> 1:06:50.625
Well, it's the obvious place for it,
Mrs. Pretty.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:55.291
[Pretty]
London is preparing for air raids.

1:06:55.791 --> 1:06:58.958
The British Museum is currently
being emptied of its treasures, isn't it?

1:06:59.041 --> 1:07:02.250
[Phillips] Uh, yes,
but, um, it… it'll go to the lab.

1:07:03.250 --> 1:07:05.583
[Pretty] This treasure came
from someone's grave.

1:07:06.708 --> 1:07:10.041
There'll be an inquest, as you know,
and its fate will be decided there.

1:07:10.833 --> 1:07:12.333
Until then, Mr. Brown…

1:07:13.416 --> 1:07:15.000
as the finder of this magnificent ship,

1:07:15.083 --> 1:07:17.166
would you please take the treasure
up to the house?

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:19.083
Uh, yes, Mrs. Pretty.

1:07:19.166 --> 1:07:20.666
Thank you all very much.

1:07:21.375 --> 1:07:26.000
[Brown] Right, uh, gentlemen,
I'll need some assistance. Mr. Lomax?

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.875
[Phillips] This is most irregular.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:30.625
[Grimes] It all belongs to Mrs. Pretty,
doesn't it?

1:07:30.708 --> 1:07:32.208
It's found on her land.

1:07:32.291 --> 1:07:34.375
[Piggott] Well, surely,
the inquest will decide

1:07:34.458 --> 1:07:37.166
whether the treasure
belongs to Mrs. Pretty or the Crown.

1:07:37.250 --> 1:07:40.333
[Phillips] Piggott, do you want
this treasure to go to the Ipswich Museum?

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.041
[Pretty] Am I doing the right thing?

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:46.000
It's someone's grave.

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000
[Brown] No, that's…
that's life what's revealed.

1:07:52.291 --> 1:07:53.791
And that's why we dig.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.208
[Pretty] Just in here.
I think that's best.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:25.500
They're like emissaries
from another world.

1:08:33.166 --> 1:08:36.083
[Rory] I used to camp
with Robert's father, you see.

1:08:36.166 --> 1:08:39.083
[Rory] I remember him telling me the calls
of all the birds.

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:42.791
Now, whenever I hear nightingales,
I think of these woods.

1:08:42.875 --> 1:08:45.583
-[Peggy] Are there nightingales?
-Haven't you heard them?

1:08:45.666 --> 1:08:46.666
[Peggy] No.

1:08:47.666 --> 1:08:51.125
Never heard a nightingale at all.
Only on the wireless.

1:08:51.625 --> 1:08:54.500
There's a wonderful cellist
called Beatrice Harrison.

1:08:54.583 --> 1:08:57.750
In the summer evenings,
she used to practice in the garden, and…

1:08:58.250 --> 1:09:01.708
one night, she was playing a scale,
and a… a nightingale joined in.

1:09:02.791 --> 1:09:05.250
At first, she couldn't believe it.
She started playing a sonata,

1:09:05.333 --> 1:09:08.041
and the nightingale accompanied her.

1:09:08.791 --> 1:09:10.333
-[Rory] Really?
-[Peggy] Mm-hmm. Yes.

1:09:10.416 --> 1:09:13.333
[chuckles] Yes. It happened again
the next night and next night.

1:09:13.416 --> 1:09:14.916
Miss Harrison was so excited about it,

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.791
she went to the BBC
and told them all about it.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:17.708
[Rory] And?

1:09:17.791 --> 1:09:20.000
[Peggy] So, a few evenings later,

1:09:20.083 --> 1:09:22.291
the BBC came
and put their recording equipment

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.875
in Miss Harrison's garden.

1:09:24.375 --> 1:09:28.916
She started to play,
and they waited and, um, waited…

1:09:30.250 --> 1:09:31.125
and…

1:09:32.250 --> 1:09:35.000
and at last,
the nightingale began to sing.

1:09:37.416 --> 1:09:39.791
Went on for about 15 minutes…

1:09:40.666 --> 1:09:42.875
rising and falling with the cello.

1:09:45.416 --> 1:09:47.333
-No.
-[both laughing]

1:09:47.416 --> 1:09:48.791
-Yes.
-Wow.

1:09:49.541 --> 1:09:51.291
I know. Hmm.

1:09:53.458 --> 1:09:54.500
[sighs]

1:09:55.583 --> 1:09:59.958
But…
the really extraordinary thing is that…

1:10:00.833 --> 1:10:05.000
other people who'd been listening
to the broadcast in their gardens

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:09.625
reported that other nightingales
also started to sing.

1:10:10.625 --> 1:10:11.958
Well, that's wonderful.

1:10:13.833 --> 1:10:16.750
Yes, it was. It was wonderful.

1:10:16.833 --> 1:10:17.791
[Piggott] Margaret!

1:10:19.583 --> 1:10:22.375
-Come on!
-[Peggy sighs] All right. Hmm.

1:10:26.583 --> 1:10:29.416
Well… good night.

1:10:31.875 --> 1:10:34.291
I shall listen out
for cellos in the woods.

1:10:35.125 --> 1:10:36.166
[Peggy chuckles]

1:10:37.083 --> 1:10:38.000
[Rory scoffs]

1:10:39.041 --> 1:10:40.083
"Cellos." [mumbles]

1:10:46.375 --> 1:10:49.083
[crowd chattering]

1:10:58.333 --> 1:11:01.500
-[Brailesford] Here we are, chaps.
-[Phillips] All right.

1:11:01.583 --> 1:11:03.666
[Brailesford] Well,
we are unburying a legend.

1:11:03.750 --> 1:11:06.166
-Beowulf.
-Arthur, King of the Britons.

1:11:06.250 --> 1:11:07.291
Cheers.

1:11:07.375 --> 1:11:11.291
Talk about Dark Ages.
I can hardly see my pint.

1:11:11.375 --> 1:11:12.750
What actually is that?

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:15.083
[Piggott] It's the,
uh, trial blackouts, C.W.

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:16.333
[Phillips] Ah.

1:11:16.416 --> 1:11:19.875
So Germans will be coming by air
this time, will they?

1:11:20.791 --> 1:11:22.916
Last time, they came by the river.

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.250
In AD 600.

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:26.875
[group laughing]

1:11:26.958 --> 1:11:29.708
You know, I'm…
It's been a big day. I'm quite done in.

1:11:29.791 --> 1:11:31.625
Um, will you all excuse me?

1:11:31.708 --> 1:11:34.833
-Aw.
-Well done, Mrs. P, on a marvelous find.

1:11:34.916 --> 1:11:36.791
[Brailesford] Yes.
Cheers to your clever wife!

1:11:36.875 --> 1:11:39.291
-Yeah. No, I'll come with you, darling.
-No.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:42.625
No, no. Um, surely you want to celebrate.

1:11:42.708 --> 1:11:47.583
-Stay for another, Piggott.
-My round. Set them up again, would you?

1:11:47.666 --> 1:11:52.291
I say, C.W., ask him
if he'll take a Merovingian tremissis.

1:11:52.375 --> 1:11:54.541
[group laughing]

1:11:54.625 --> 1:11:56.458
[radio announcer] …the press campaign,

1:11:56.541 --> 1:12:00.416
the menacing statements of the statesmen
leading the policy of Germany,

1:12:00.916 --> 1:12:03.791
the systematic provocation
of frontier incidents,

1:12:03.875 --> 1:12:06.958
and finally,
the constantly increasing concentrations

1:12:07.041 --> 1:12:08.541
of mobilized armed forces

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:13.000
at the Polish frontiers
constitute an obvious proof of this.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:16.208
A Labour deputation called on
the Prime Minister last night,

1:12:16.291 --> 1:12:20.083
requesting the immediate evacuation
of women, children, and cripples

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:22.041
as precaution
against the sudden outbreak of war.

1:12:22.125 --> 1:12:25.083
[man 1 in film] He'll find Buck Rogers
if anybody can.

1:12:25.166 --> 1:12:27.166
[ships whirring]

1:12:28.791 --> 1:12:30.875
[man 2 in film] Get the guards, you fools!

1:12:30.958 --> 1:12:33.500
If they get away, I'll put every man
of you in the robot battalion!

1:12:34.791 --> 1:12:36.208
[somber piano music playing]

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:37.500
[whispering] Not yet.

1:12:39.625 --> 1:12:41.333
Not yet. [sniffles]

1:12:45.375 --> 1:12:51.125
Darling, C.W. wants me to take
some of the corroded iron to the lab.

1:12:51.208 --> 1:12:53.000
Uh, we think it might be fragmented armor,

1:12:53.083 --> 1:12:55.875
and I… I badly want
to start cleaning it up. So…

1:12:57.666 --> 1:12:58.666
Am I to come with you?

1:12:58.750 --> 1:13:03.458
No, because C.W. needs
all the hands he can get here, so, uh…

1:13:03.541 --> 1:13:05.500
And he's very pleased with you.

1:13:05.583 --> 1:13:07.041
-Is he?
-[Piggott] Mm.

1:13:07.875 --> 1:13:11.958
Uh, so I'm taking Brailesford
because the lab's really his thing.

1:13:12.041 --> 1:13:15.375
-You know.
-Ah. Oh.

1:13:16.250 --> 1:13:18.333
You're going to have
to be a brick about it, Margaret.

1:13:18.416 --> 1:13:19.291
[Peggy] Peggy.

1:13:21.083 --> 1:13:22.250
My name's Peggy.

1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000
[warplanes roaring]

1:13:30.625 --> 1:13:31.500
[Peggy sighs]

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:33.708
[mutters]

1:13:39.125 --> 1:13:42.666
I'll… I'll…
I'll miss you very much, Peggy.

1:13:47.583 --> 1:13:49.333
Sorry to take him away from you.

1:13:49.916 --> 1:13:52.666
-[engine starts]
-[Peggy sighs]

1:13:56.250 --> 1:13:58.500
[Peggy] It was very kind of you
to invite me, Mrs. Pretty.

1:13:58.583 --> 1:14:01.375
[Pretty] You can't possibly stay
in that pub without your husband.

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:03.791
Mr. Phillips
would bore you quite to death.

1:14:04.416 --> 1:14:08.208
Um, have you developed any
of your photographs yet, Mr. Lomax?

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:12.041
I've made a start. I've got a mountain
to do, and I better get through them.

1:14:12.125 --> 1:14:13.916
I could get my papers any day.

1:14:14.541 --> 1:14:16.791
Rory has been accepted into the RAF.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.541
Should I congratulate you?

1:14:20.041 --> 1:14:22.625
I don't know. Cousin Edith didn't.

1:14:26.333 --> 1:14:27.416
This looks delicious.

1:14:30.041 --> 1:14:31.125
[Pretty] Bon appétit.

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:35.083
[Pretty] Don't be too long, now, darling.
It's late.

1:14:35.166 --> 1:14:37.875
[Brown] And now,
that's a partial eclipse of the moon.

1:14:38.375 --> 1:14:39.833
[Pretty] And don't run.

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:40.833
[Pretty] Oh, dear.

1:14:40.916 --> 1:14:42.083
[Pretty] Wait for us.

1:14:42.166 --> 1:14:46.333
-[Pretty] Isn't that a bad omen?
-[Brown] Well, they used to think so.

1:14:49.666 --> 1:14:52.208
[Pretty] It does make you feel
the gods are angry.

1:14:52.291 --> 1:14:54.333
The people who buried that ship…

1:14:55.958 --> 1:14:57.291
What did they believe?

1:14:57.916 --> 1:15:01.625
[Brown] Well… they were sailing somewhere,
weren't they?

1:15:02.875 --> 1:15:06.083
Down to the underworld or up to the stars.

1:15:08.666 --> 1:15:10.541
[Pretty] Wherever we go when we die.

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:17.083
[Phillips] So we're rather coming
to the dregs, aren't we?

1:15:17.916 --> 1:15:20.000
The coroner has been in touch.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.416
An inquest has been called for Friday,
and your presence is required.

1:15:26.541 --> 1:15:29.458
There's been quite
a lot of public interest in our ship.

1:15:29.541 --> 1:15:32.541
So afterwards,
I've invited everyone to come and see it.

1:15:32.625 --> 1:15:34.208
Uh… everyone?

1:15:34.916 --> 1:15:38.125
[Pretty] The villagers are coming
and my friends from the county.

1:15:38.791 --> 1:15:44.083
May I remind you
just how fragile this site is?

1:15:45.291 --> 1:15:48.541
Please feel free
to invite your families and friends.

1:15:50.125 --> 1:15:51.291
Mrs. Pretty…

1:15:51.375 --> 1:15:54.291
[warplane sputtering]

1:15:56.708 --> 1:15:57.916
Good God.

1:15:59.750 --> 1:16:00.833
[Pretty] Robert?

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.541
[warplane engine stops]

1:16:12.125 --> 1:16:13.083
[loud crashing]

1:16:13.166 --> 1:16:14.458
[water splashes]

1:16:14.958 --> 1:16:18.041
Don't let anyone swim!
It's tidal. The current is fierce!

1:16:18.125 --> 1:16:19.000
Darling.

1:16:19.083 --> 1:16:20.583
[dramatic music playing]

1:16:43.250 --> 1:16:44.458
[inhales deeply]

1:17:27.625 --> 1:17:29.666
[Rory panting and grunting]

1:17:39.291 --> 1:17:42.416
They train these boys
on rickety planes from the Great War.

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:46.000
My husband said,
"If you want your son to die,

1:17:46.083 --> 1:17:48.000
then let him join the Air Force."

1:17:50.166 --> 1:17:52.875
[Peggy] They say
this war will be fought in the air.

1:17:54.583 --> 1:17:56.166
[Robert] What happened, Mother?

1:17:56.958 --> 1:17:58.375
Is he all right?

1:17:59.083 --> 1:18:02.083
-I must get Robert up to the house.
-Shall I take him for you?

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:05.791
-He won't want to go.
-Uh, I'll ask him to look after me.

1:18:07.458 --> 1:18:08.583
[Pretty] Thank you.

1:18:09.083 --> 1:18:09.916
[Peggy] Robert!

1:18:10.625 --> 1:18:13.416
-[Robert] Yes?
-[Peggy sighs] I… I feel rather faint.

1:18:14.166 --> 1:18:17.541
Oh, well, when I feel faint,
I have a good lie-down

1:18:17.625 --> 1:18:18.958
and a big glass of water.

1:18:19.083 --> 1:18:21.041
-[Peggy] Do you?
-[Robert] And that does the trick.

1:18:21.125 --> 1:18:22.166
[Peggy] That's what I need.

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:24.083
-Will you take my hand?
-[Robert] Sure.

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:29.000
[seagulls screeching]

1:18:52.625 --> 1:18:54.458
[Pretty exhales deeply]

1:19:04.083 --> 1:19:08.916
[Peggy] His name was David Atkinson.
It was his second solo flight.

1:19:10.750 --> 1:19:15.708
Police and the coroner are here.
I brought you some dry things.

1:19:19.583 --> 1:19:22.875
[Rory] I've got some coffee
back at my tent.

1:19:26.458 --> 1:19:27.750
Would you like some?

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:33.000
[Peggy] My father drowned…

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:36.000
on a holiday in Cornwall.

1:19:36.541 --> 1:19:38.541
He was taken by the current.

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.708
-[Rory] I'm sorry.
-[Peggy] Oh, no.

1:19:41.791 --> 1:19:43.333
It was a long time ago.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:45.958
He had epilepsy.

1:19:49.833 --> 1:19:51.750
So, what drew you to photography?

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:54.083
[Rory] Oh, I suppose it's, um…

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:57.541
It's just a way
of trying to fix things as they…

1:19:58.291 --> 1:19:59.208
as they go past.

1:19:59.291 --> 1:20:02.833
-[Peggy] Mm.
-[Rory] Keep what's vital from being lost.

1:20:03.916 --> 1:20:07.583
My father once gave me an old coin…

1:20:09.083 --> 1:20:12.166
and he said it was
from the time of Caesar Augustus.

1:20:13.875 --> 1:20:18.583
And I knew the story from the Bible
where Jesus showed the disciples a coin.

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:21.541
"Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar's."

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:25.625
-[chuckles lightly]
-Yes.

1:20:26.208 --> 1:20:27.583
And I… [sighs]

1:20:27.666 --> 1:20:31.083
…well, I… I became convinced
that the coin I had

1:20:31.166 --> 1:20:34.125
was the one that Jesus
had actually shown the disciples.

1:20:34.625 --> 1:20:38.750
I used to marvel that I could hold it.

1:20:43.125 --> 1:20:44.750
What happened to your coin?

1:20:45.916 --> 1:20:47.125
Oh…

1:20:49.708 --> 1:20:50.708
Uh…

1:20:54.083 --> 1:20:56.041
-I wear it. [chuckles]
-[Rory gasps]

1:21:02.041 --> 1:21:03.750
I thought it might bring me luck.

1:21:06.666 --> 1:21:07.583
And has it?

1:21:16.666 --> 1:21:18.041
If 1,000 years…

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.875
were to pass in an instant…

1:21:25.791 --> 1:21:27.333
what would be left of us?

1:21:29.458 --> 1:21:30.291
[Peggy] This.

1:21:34.333 --> 1:21:35.833
And parts of your watch.

1:21:36.791 --> 1:21:37.916
Torch.

1:21:39.833 --> 1:21:41.125
Fragments of the mug.

1:21:42.958 --> 1:21:47.583
[Rory] But every last scrap
of you and I would… disappear.

1:21:48.833 --> 1:21:50.666
-[Rory] Listen.
-[nightingales singing]

1:21:50.750 --> 1:21:51.583
[Peggy] What?

1:21:56.125 --> 1:21:59.416
[both gasp, laugh]

1:22:00.958 --> 1:22:02.625
[Pretty sighs]

1:22:07.375 --> 1:22:09.500
[Robert] The pilot died, didn't he?

1:22:10.250 --> 1:22:11.666
Yes, darling.

1:22:16.875 --> 1:22:17.833
Wait.

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:22.666
-[sighs, breathing shakily]
-[Robert] Rory won't die, will he?

1:22:23.166 --> 1:22:24.166
I'm sorry.

1:22:24.958 --> 1:22:25.916
No.

1:22:35.666 --> 1:22:36.791
You won't die?

1:22:47.791 --> 1:22:51.250
[breathing shakily]

1:23:01.875 --> 1:23:03.875
[Pretty gasping]

1:23:05.791 --> 1:23:06.833
[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty?

1:23:06.916 --> 1:23:09.541
[Pretty continues gasping]

1:23:10.458 --> 1:23:12.833
-[Peggy] Are you unwell?
-I've, um…

1:23:12.916 --> 1:23:16.791
-Perhaps you might lead me to my room.
-Yes, of course. Of course.

1:23:17.625 --> 1:23:21.208
-[groaning]
-[Peggy] Are you all right?

1:23:21.291 --> 1:23:23.083
[Pretty laughing weakly] Yes! Yes.

1:23:23.166 --> 1:23:25.541
-[Peggy] Should I call a doctor?
-[Pretty] No, no, no. It's…

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:27.208
It's heartburn. It's…

1:23:27.291 --> 1:23:29.875
[muffled] No, I don't want to wake him.

1:23:30.708 --> 1:23:31.708
[Robert gasps]

1:23:32.666 --> 1:23:35.750
-[Pretty gasping]
-[Peggy] Mrs. Pretty, are you all right?

1:23:37.208 --> 1:23:38.541
[Pretty] I'm such a bore.

1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:42.791
Would you mind…
Would you mind getting me some milk?

1:23:42.875 --> 1:23:44.041
-[Peggy] Yes.
-Thank you.

1:23:44.125 --> 1:23:46.416
-[Peggy] Are you sure?
-[sobbing] Yes, thank you.

1:23:50.250 --> 1:23:52.291
-[Peggy] Oh.
-Robert! Darling…

1:23:52.375 --> 1:23:53.833
[moans]

1:23:57.666 --> 1:23:58.875
[Robert panting]

1:23:58.958 --> 1:24:00.833
-[grunts]
-[Brown] Oh! Robert.

1:24:01.541 --> 1:24:03.333
-[Robert groans]
-[Brown] You all right?

1:24:03.416 --> 1:24:04.333
[Robert shouts]

1:24:05.875 --> 1:24:07.083
[Brown] Robert?

1:24:07.166 --> 1:24:11.250
I know she's sick. I know it!
There's nothing I can do!

1:24:11.333 --> 1:24:14.458
Why is there nothing I can do?
I should be able to make her better.

1:24:14.541 --> 1:24:16.833
You do. You do make her better.

1:24:17.458 --> 1:24:20.125
[Robert]
No, she's worse. She is, I can see it!

1:24:20.875 --> 1:24:22.875
[sobbing]

1:24:23.916 --> 1:24:24.958
She is.

1:24:29.250 --> 1:24:30.958
When… When my father died…

1:24:31.041 --> 1:24:32.500
[sobs heavily]

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:33.666
[Brown] Mm.

1:24:33.750 --> 1:24:36.500
…everyone said
I had to look after my mother.

1:24:37.041 --> 1:24:39.875
[sniffles] And I failed.

1:24:39.958 --> 1:24:41.291
I failed.

1:24:45.750 --> 1:24:46.625
Robert…

1:24:46.708 --> 1:24:48.708
[gentle instrumental music playing]

1:24:50.916 --> 1:24:51.958
…we all fail.

1:24:54.375 --> 1:24:55.458
Every day.

1:24:56.916 --> 1:24:59.708
There are some things
we just can't succeed at…

1:25:01.208 --> 1:25:03.833
no matter how hard we try.

1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:11.750
I know it's not what you want to hear.

1:25:12.416 --> 1:25:15.000
I… I'm stronger than she thinks I am.

1:25:16.125 --> 1:25:19.583
[Brown] I know. Perhaps you'll show her.

1:25:22.791 --> 1:25:23.625
Now…

1:25:24.666 --> 1:25:27.708
we should get you inside, Robert.

1:25:28.791 --> 1:25:29.708
Come on.

1:25:30.666 --> 1:25:33.083
I think it's time for your bed, you know.
Come on, then.

1:25:33.875 --> 1:25:36.333
[Pretty breathing steadily]

1:25:36.416 --> 1:25:39.958
[Brown and Robert speaking indistinctly]

1:25:43.166 --> 1:25:44.500
[Phillips laughing]

1:25:45.458 --> 1:25:47.708
[Phillips] Apparently,
there's a whole convoy

1:25:47.791 --> 1:25:49.333
of hacks on the way.

1:25:50.208 --> 1:25:54.541
I already have some joker
from the Sunday Mirror asking me

1:25:54.625 --> 1:25:57.083
if the ship is still seaworthy.

1:25:57.166 --> 1:26:01.416
So, what happens to the treasure?
That's the real question.

1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:03.333
[radio announcer]
Germany has invaded Poland…

1:26:03.416 --> 1:26:04.666
[Piggott] Have you seen my wife?

1:26:04.750 --> 1:26:06.166
…and has bombed many towns.

1:26:06.250 --> 1:26:10.625
Orders completing the mobilization
of the Navy, Army, and Air Force

1:26:10.708 --> 1:26:14.458
were signed by the King at a meeting
this afternoon of the privy council.

1:26:14.958 --> 1:26:16.833
[radio announcer 2]
The King and Queen decided...

1:26:16.916 --> 1:26:18.125
[Phillips sighs] Well.

1:26:19.750 --> 1:26:20.875
Here we go, then.

1:26:20.958 --> 1:26:24.958
The Queen drove from the palace to visit
the Westminister ARP headquarters.

1:26:27.541 --> 1:26:29.541
[somber instrumental music playing]

1:26:54.708 --> 1:26:56.250
[Rory] I've just received this.

1:27:00.416 --> 1:27:03.041
I'm to report
to RAF Martlesham this morning.

1:27:03.750 --> 1:27:05.166
There's the inquest.

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:09.625
[scoffs] It's my medical assessment.
I can't… I can't bunk it. Sorry.

1:27:09.708 --> 1:27:13.166
I put some photographs
in the dining room for your guests.

1:27:14.333 --> 1:27:16.333
Rory, I'm telling you
in no uncertain terms

1:27:16.416 --> 1:27:17.833
that you cannot possibly die.

1:27:17.916 --> 1:27:18.916
[scoffs]

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.625
[Pretty] I'm saying this most seriously.
Don't you dare put yourself in danger.

1:27:24.791 --> 1:27:29.000
Well… I'm not sure
I shall have much choice. [chuckles]

1:27:30.375 --> 1:27:32.083
Robert is going to need you.

1:27:34.416 --> 1:27:35.666
Do you understand?

1:27:36.416 --> 1:27:37.875
[Brown] Good morning, Robert.

1:27:38.416 --> 1:27:41.458
-Today's the day.
-I want to take my mother sailing.

1:27:41.541 --> 1:27:43.333
I don't think
that ship is sailing anywhere.

1:27:43.416 --> 1:27:45.708
You know, it's just compacted sand.

1:27:46.375 --> 1:27:49.291
There's nothing holding it, except time.

1:27:49.375 --> 1:27:52.916
-That won't matter. Not where we're going.
-Now, where's that, then?

1:27:53.416 --> 1:27:57.375
-Will you come?
-[Brown] Well, if I'm invited, I'll come.

1:27:59.625 --> 1:28:00.833
-Morning.
-[Rory] Hello.

1:28:03.833 --> 1:28:04.916
Those for me?

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.875
[laughs] No, I'm looking for my wife.

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.958
Well, perhaps you'd say goodbye for me.

1:28:11.958 --> 1:28:13.375
I've been called up.

1:28:13.458 --> 1:28:14.458
Oh.

1:28:15.166 --> 1:28:16.250
Of course.

1:28:17.333 --> 1:28:19.500
Well, best of British.

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.458
Stuart.

1:28:22.291 --> 1:28:23.708
[Piggott] I… I bought you these.

1:28:26.083 --> 1:28:26.916
How lovely.

1:28:32.250 --> 1:28:35.583
Um, Lomax was just telling me
that he's been called up.

1:28:39.041 --> 1:28:40.000
Oh.

1:28:41.250 --> 1:28:43.625
-Uh, well, it…
-[Rory] Um…

1:28:44.791 --> 1:28:45.958
[Peggy] Well, I…

1:28:46.958 --> 1:28:49.250
Uh, I'd better go. Goodbye.

1:28:57.833 --> 1:28:58.875
Uh…

1:29:13.458 --> 1:29:15.458
[radio announcer]
According to an official telegram,

1:29:15.541 --> 1:29:19.125
Warsaw has been bombed six times today.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:23.291
The telegram adds that fighting
of a most serious nature continues

1:29:23.375 --> 1:29:24.875
on the whole length of the front.

1:29:24.958 --> 1:29:27.125
We're in for another bloody mess.

1:29:27.750 --> 1:29:30.291
[reporter 1] Oh, here we go.
Did you hear the results?

1:29:30.375 --> 1:29:33.583
[people and reporters clamoring]

1:29:33.666 --> 1:29:36.291
-[reporter 2] I just want a quick photo!
-[woman] Mrs. Pretty!

1:29:36.375 --> 1:29:37.666
[officer] Please, make way.

1:29:37.750 --> 1:29:39.750
[crowd clamoring]

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:43.458
[Brown] Make way, please.

1:29:45.791 --> 1:29:48.208
-Do you want me in the car with you?
-[Pretty] Yes.

1:29:48.291 --> 1:29:49.750
[Brown] Maynard! Maynard!

1:29:50.500 --> 1:29:53.958
Maynard? Can you make sure
my wife gets in the house?

1:29:54.041 --> 1:29:56.041
[crowd continues clamoring]

1:29:57.666 --> 1:30:02.125
[Phillips] I… I hope I have
the opportunity to speak to you later.

1:30:03.833 --> 1:30:06.000
-[woman 2] Mrs. Pretty?
-[woman 3] Mrs. Pretty!

1:30:08.541 --> 1:30:09.958
[car horn honking loudly]

1:30:10.041 --> 1:30:11.625
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1:30:13.791 --> 1:30:16.541
[reporters shouting]

1:30:22.208 --> 1:30:24.208
[Pretty breathing shakily]

1:30:28.750 --> 1:30:31.083
[sobbing] I'm terribly sorry.

1:30:38.791 --> 1:30:41.291
Thank you. Thank you.

1:30:42.291 --> 1:30:47.333
[Phillips] These people
were not savage warriors.

1:30:48.291 --> 1:30:49.750
These… These… These were…

1:30:49.833 --> 1:30:54.708
These were sophisticated people
with incredible artistry.

1:30:56.708 --> 1:31:00.375
The Dark Ages are no longer dark.

1:31:00.958 --> 1:31:03.083
[brass band playing fanfare]

1:31:03.166 --> 1:31:05.125
[indistinct chatter]

1:31:09.250 --> 1:31:10.708
[glasses clink]

1:31:10.791 --> 1:31:12.666
This is sherry.
I suppose it's sherry, is it?

1:31:12.750 --> 1:31:13.875
[May] I don't know.

1:31:14.958 --> 1:31:17.291
Should we drink it now,
or is there going to be a toast?

1:31:17.375 --> 1:31:18.958
What's everyone else doing?

1:31:19.041 --> 1:31:21.208
[glass clinks repeatedly]

1:31:23.166 --> 1:31:25.166
[fanfare ends]

1:31:25.708 --> 1:31:29.333
[Pretty] The artifacts discovered here
have caused a national sensation.

1:31:30.333 --> 1:31:31.708
[Pretty] You must all know by now

1:31:31.791 --> 1:31:34.708
that they were recovered
from a chamber in the middle of a ship…

1:31:35.500 --> 1:31:39.291
a burial ship, engineered from oak.

1:31:40.750 --> 1:31:44.333
In my opinion, the greatest
and most beautiful treasure of all.

1:31:45.708 --> 1:31:49.125
Ninety feet long, lying east to west.

1:31:50.541 --> 1:31:53.625
Found and excavated by Mr. Basil Brown.

1:31:53.708 --> 1:31:54.916
[guests applaud]

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:56.333
-To Basil!
-Mr. Brown!

1:31:56.416 --> 1:31:59.458
[guests cheer]

1:32:03.750 --> 1:32:05.875
[sound fades]

1:32:05.958 --> 1:32:07.958
[engine running]

1:32:13.250 --> 1:32:15.250
[Pretty sobbing, sniffling]

1:32:16.041 --> 1:32:17.208
I'm terribly sorry.

1:32:19.833 --> 1:32:23.583
I thought you'd be pleased
with the verdict.

1:32:30.791 --> 1:32:32.166
[Pretty] We die.

1:32:34.625 --> 1:32:36.541
We die and we decay.

1:32:38.375 --> 1:32:39.791
We don't live on.

1:32:43.958 --> 1:32:45.833
I'm not sure I agree.

1:32:47.250 --> 1:32:50.708
From the first human handprint
on a cave wall…

1:32:51.833 --> 1:32:55.208
we're part of something continuous.

1:32:56.500 --> 1:32:59.916
[Brown] So, we… don't really die.

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:02.000
[gentle piano music playing]

1:33:21.333 --> 1:33:23.333
[Peggy cries softly]

1:33:30.833 --> 1:33:34.041
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Pretty] Rory put these out this morning.

1:33:35.666 --> 1:33:37.333
It completely slipped my mind.

1:33:41.750 --> 1:33:43.750
[Peggy sobbing]

1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:53.500
Sit down.

1:33:55.208 --> 1:33:57.000
[Peggy continues sobbing]

1:34:00.541 --> 1:34:03.708
[Pretty] I'm sure
work like yours is very sustaining…

1:34:05.458 --> 1:34:06.916
but it's not enough.

1:34:10.416 --> 1:34:11.875
Life is very fleeting.

1:34:13.583 --> 1:34:14.666
I've learnt that.

1:34:16.041 --> 1:34:18.166
It has moments you should seize.

1:34:25.041 --> 1:34:28.208
It could not be a better result,
Mrs. Pretty.

1:34:28.791 --> 1:34:30.541
The whole of Suffolk
has been on your side.

1:34:30.625 --> 1:34:32.666
-[Pretty] Yes.
-I saw you in her car.

1:34:33.958 --> 1:34:36.666
Did she mention her intentions?

1:34:36.750 --> 1:34:39.833
-About the tea?
-[scoffs] About the treasure, man.

1:34:39.916 --> 1:34:42.166
-Oh.
-Yes, what's she planning?

1:34:42.250 --> 1:34:44.416
We hope that you'll agree
that the Ipswich Museum

1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:45.541
is the perfect place for--

1:34:45.625 --> 1:34:49.041
-Can we talk another time? Excuse me.
-Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes.

1:34:49.125 --> 1:34:51.000
[Phillips] She trusts you, man.

1:34:51.083 --> 1:34:52.791
Don't let her give it to Ipswich.

1:34:53.416 --> 1:34:55.541
The British Museum would buy everything.

1:34:55.625 --> 1:34:59.625
It's priceless, of course,
but she'll have to be reasonable.

1:34:59.708 --> 1:35:01.916
Are you asking me to plead your case?

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:03.500
[Phillips sighs forcefully]

1:35:03.583 --> 1:35:06.166
Have some lemon drizzle cake,
Mr. Phillips.

1:35:06.250 --> 1:35:07.750
It is most refreshing.

1:35:07.833 --> 1:35:09.458
[Phillips sighs]

1:35:09.541 --> 1:35:12.500
Thank you so much for what you said.
I could have cheered.

1:35:12.583 --> 1:35:13.416
[Pretty] Mm-hmm.

1:35:14.125 --> 1:35:15.125
[May sighs]

1:35:16.583 --> 1:35:18.958
[Pretty]
My son has formed a strong attachment.

1:35:19.625 --> 1:35:21.541
[May] Basil's very fond of him, too.

1:35:23.833 --> 1:35:26.291
Perhaps you might let him visit you
from time to time.

1:35:27.333 --> 1:35:28.333
Of course.

1:35:29.166 --> 1:35:30.541
We'd be glad to.

1:35:33.791 --> 1:35:35.958
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Piggott laughing]

1:35:36.375 --> 1:35:38.333
-[Piggott] Back in a tick.
-[Brailesford] Right.

1:35:38.416 --> 1:35:40.416
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1:35:44.041 --> 1:35:47.041
C.W.'s suggesting
we make a move to the ball.

1:35:48.583 --> 1:35:52.291
Hmm. Well, I think
that you should go on… [clears throat]

1:35:52.791 --> 1:35:54.125
…uh, without me.

1:35:55.041 --> 1:35:56.000
So, will…

1:35:56.791 --> 1:35:57.875
will you follow us?

1:35:58.583 --> 1:35:59.583
[Peggy sighs] Uh…

1:36:01.208 --> 1:36:02.291
I…

1:36:03.416 --> 1:36:04.625
I don't think so.

1:36:07.541 --> 1:36:08.541
[sighs]

1:36:10.791 --> 1:36:11.750
No.

1:36:13.291 --> 1:36:17.000
We both have our own paths
to, um, follow, don't we?

1:36:17.083 --> 1:36:19.708
And I've seen you when you're happy.

1:36:20.625 --> 1:36:21.916
You're rather beautiful.

1:36:22.583 --> 1:36:24.500
-I'm happy with you.
-[sighs lightly]

1:36:29.666 --> 1:36:32.166
-I could… I could learn to be.
-[Peggy sighs]

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.250
I think that would be an awful shame.

1:36:36.833 --> 1:36:38.833
[Brailesford] Stuart! Shall we wait?

1:36:40.250 --> 1:36:42.208
[Phillips] Let's… Let's go. Come on.

1:36:44.416 --> 1:36:45.333
Go on.

1:36:54.250 --> 1:36:55.333
Go on.

1:37:23.125 --> 1:37:24.250
[Brown] Hmm.

1:37:26.458 --> 1:37:28.708
May… [clicks tongue]

1:37:29.208 --> 1:37:32.583
That site, it needs to be made safe
for the future,

1:37:32.666 --> 1:37:35.166
so it… it don't further decay. So…

1:37:36.541 --> 1:37:38.208
that's another week's work.

1:37:40.208 --> 1:37:43.041
[May]
You say your goodbyes to the old girl.

1:37:44.416 --> 1:37:45.958
Do you take care of her.

1:37:52.375 --> 1:37:54.458
You… You don't want to stay the night?

1:37:55.125 --> 1:37:57.041
I'll see you next week.

1:37:57.125 --> 1:37:58.500
[Brown exhales]

1:38:09.958 --> 1:38:13.125
[warplanes humming]

1:38:13.208 --> 1:38:15.458
[Brown] I'll line the hull with hessian…

1:38:16.583 --> 1:38:19.500
and cover that
with a… a layer of branches…

1:38:20.916 --> 1:38:23.000
to protect it
from the weight of the earth.

1:38:23.083 --> 1:38:25.083
All this soil's got to go back in.

1:38:26.708 --> 1:38:28.250
Leave it as we found it.

1:38:30.708 --> 1:38:33.208
I'm giving the treasure
to the British Museum.

1:38:35.166 --> 1:38:36.375
As a gift.

1:38:39.250 --> 1:38:42.625
It should be where the greatest number
of people can freely see it.

1:38:45.333 --> 1:38:46.750
I haven't told them yet.

1:38:48.041 --> 1:38:49.500
I wanted to tell you.

1:38:50.666 --> 1:38:53.208
[clicks tongue] Well, that's a…
That's a hell of a big gift.

1:38:53.291 --> 1:38:57.625
[chuckles softly] I don't know
anyone's ever made a gift as big as that.

1:38:58.333 --> 1:38:59.875
Apparently, they haven't.

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:07.750
I also told Mr. Phillips that I expect
your work to receive proper recognition.

1:39:13.708 --> 1:39:14.666
Thank you.

1:39:19.375 --> 1:39:21.375
[birds calling]

1:39:23.875 --> 1:39:25.875
[somber piano music playing]

1:39:26.458 --> 1:39:28.333
[Brown humming]

1:39:38.625 --> 1:39:40.125
[Peggy takes a deep breath]

1:39:44.625 --> 1:39:45.708
[sighs]

1:40:06.541 --> 1:40:08.541
[birds singing]

1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:14.958
[branches rustling]

1:40:16.541 --> 1:40:17.625
[Peggy gasps]

1:40:27.041 --> 1:40:29.958
-[Robert] Steer it steady, Mr. Brown.
-[Brown] Aye, aye.

1:40:30.041 --> 1:40:32.000
We're coming towards the edge
of the atmosphere.

1:40:32.083 --> 1:40:33.625
Can you see it, Mother?

1:40:33.708 --> 1:40:35.750
We're sailing into the cosmos.

1:40:36.250 --> 1:40:39.250
Yes, I can. Where are we heading?

1:40:39.333 --> 1:40:42.500
Orion's Belt, to take the Queen home.

1:40:43.083 --> 1:40:44.458
[Pretty] Which Queen?

1:40:44.541 --> 1:40:49.041
This boat's hers. Her people gave
her treasure for her home voyage.

1:40:53.333 --> 1:40:56.083
[Robert] And she was sad
when the ship came…

1:40:57.375 --> 1:41:01.291
because she knew
she'd be leaving everyone behind.

1:41:02.750 --> 1:41:04.625
And she was worried

1:41:05.583 --> 1:41:08.375
that they wouldn't get on
very well without her…

1:41:09.833 --> 1:41:13.041
but she knew
she had to follow the King into the sky.

1:41:14.041 --> 1:41:15.541
And so, she set off…

1:41:16.541 --> 1:41:19.750
through the Earth and up into the cosmos.

1:41:20.958 --> 1:41:23.458
-Space is a funny thing.
-[Pretty chuckles]

1:41:23.541 --> 1:41:28.875
Time operates quite differently up there,
and 500 years can pass in a flash.

1:41:31.083 --> 1:41:33.458
And the Queen looked back down to Earth.

1:41:34.166 --> 1:41:38.791
She could see that her son had grown up
and that he was now a space pilot.

1:41:38.875 --> 1:41:40.041
[Pretty laughs]

1:41:43.041 --> 1:41:47.250
[Robert] And she knew that when he made
his first journey up to the stars,

1:41:48.125 --> 1:41:50.166
she would be there to meet him.

1:41:51.125 --> 1:41:53.541
[Peggy panting, sobbing]

1:41:56.250 --> 1:41:58.250
[seagulls crying]

1:41:59.541 --> 1:42:00.791
[Peggy moans]

1:42:03.500 --> 1:42:06.000
[Chamberlain on radio]
This morning, the British ambassador

1:42:06.083 --> 1:42:10.708
in Berlin handed
the German government a final note…

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:17.125
stating that,
unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock,

1:42:17.625 --> 1:42:22.708
that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1:42:22.791 --> 1:42:26.166
a state of war would exist between us.

1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:28.750
I have to tell you now

1:42:29.250 --> 1:42:32.041
that no such undertaking
has been received,

1:42:33.041 --> 1:42:38.333
and that, consequently,
this country is at war with Germany.

1:42:38.416 --> 1:42:40.875
-Good night, sir.
-Good night to you.

1:42:40.958 --> 1:42:42.958
[indistinct chatter]

1:42:43.041 --> 1:42:47.416
[Chamberlain] You can imagine
what a bitter blow it is to me

1:42:47.916 --> 1:42:51.250
that all my long struggle
to win peace has failed.

1:42:51.333 --> 1:42:53.125
-Good night to you.
-Good night.

1:42:53.208 --> 1:42:55.208
[somber piano music playing]

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:58.750
[Chamberlain]
The government have made plans

1:42:59.250 --> 1:43:02.916
under which it will be possible
to carry on the work of the nation

1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:06.625
in the days of stress and strain
that may be ahead…

1:43:07.291 --> 1:43:09.166
[coin jingles]

1:43:09.250 --> 1:43:11.500
…but these plans need your help.

1:43:15.416 --> 1:43:16.458
[Peggy sighs]

1:43:17.125 --> 1:43:20.333
[Chamberlain] You may be taking your part
in the fighting services

1:43:20.833 --> 1:43:22.250
or as a volunteer.

1:43:24.083 --> 1:43:26.375
If so, you will report for duty

1:43:26.458 --> 1:43:29.250
in accordance
with the instructions you receive.

1:43:29.333 --> 1:43:30.458
[Peggy sighs]

1:43:39.083 --> 1:43:43.083
[Chamberlain] It is of vital importance
that you should carry on with your jobs.

1:43:46.791 --> 1:43:49.166
Now, may God bless you all.

1:43:56.708 --> 1:43:58.291
[thunder rumbling in distance]

1:44:00.708 --> 1:44:04.625
-[rain pattering]
-[wind whipping]

1:44:10.833 --> 1:44:14.166
[Brown takes a deep breath, sniffles]

1:44:43.625 --> 1:44:44.500
[Brown grunting]

1:44:53.666 --> 1:44:55.166
[men grunting lightly]

1:46:11.958 --> 1:46:13.708
[crew speaking indistinctly]

1:48:01.541 --> 1:48:03.541
[energetic orchestral music playing]

1:50:29.625 --> 1:50:32.416
[somber instrumental music playing]
