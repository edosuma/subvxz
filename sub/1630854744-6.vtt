00:19.061 --> 00:20.646
<i>Just make sure you send somebody.</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:26.443
<i>Fast.</i>

00:28.654 --> 00:29.821
It's okay.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.740
You're safe.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.742
- <i>...tell us anything?</i>
- <i>How long...</i>

00:35.577 --> 00:37.913
- <i>How long were you up there?</i>
- Are you in any pain?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.083
Do you know what happened to you?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.254
Do you know your assailant?

00:46.463 --> 00:48.090
Just lie back for me, honey.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.261
Can you point to where it hurts?

00:52.845 --> 00:54.680
- <i>Do you remember...</i>
- <i>...any others...</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:56.557
<i>How do you feel?</i>

00:56.557 --> 00:58.392
Just relax.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.436
Have you or your family been threatened?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.564
Take this, honey.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.693
Can you identify
the person who assaulted you?

01:11.697 --> 01:14.199
...but we can only get
the bastards with your help.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.493
Can you remember anyone's face?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.350
In here is all I got
in this world right now.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.144
I never unpack my bag. You?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.652
So you a neo at this. Okay.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.154
Low-key, they be stealing
in these foster homes.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.783
I had this halter top from Macy's once
that just vanished.

03:19.783 --> 03:23.120
An older girl in the home used to jack
everybody for they shit.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.456
Plus, we move around so much,
it's like why bother unpacking?

03:30.002 --> 03:31.003
Oh, God, no.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.172
They gave us candy corn
in our treat boxes.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.886
Yo. I know these taste like wax,
but they remind me of my mom.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.014
At Easter, she would fill
my whole basket with it,

03:42.014 --> 03:43.682
and we'd eat it till we threw up.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.984
Today was crazy, right?

03:55.986 --> 03:56.987
We're lucky.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.032
If we was 18, we'd be in jail right now.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.329
Although
this all kind of feels like jail anyway,

04:06.663 --> 04:08.457
being kept away from our families.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.921
Next month is gonna be two years for me.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.255
How long you been in the life?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.968
What? You don't talk?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.226
I miss my mom.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.398
I know she's gonna flip out
when she sees how much taller I've gotten.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.197
What about you?
Did you miss your family too?

04:54.753 --> 04:57.548
- Does Trini have a curfew?
- Yeah.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.384
It's ten o'clock on school nights

05:00.384 --> 05:02.261
- and midnight on weekends.
- Yeah.

05:03.512 --> 05:06.348
Has she missed curfew?
Hung out with friends you haven't met?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.810
No. We know all of her friends.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.312
We thought we knew her boyfriend.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.233
We're good parents, all right?

05:17.067 --> 05:17.901
We just...

05:21.238 --> 05:23.490
What about your finances? Any debt?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.658
What does that have to do--

05:24.658 --> 05:29.746
She's trying to figure out
if we were involved in trafficking Trini.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.124
If we used her to pay off a debt.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.210
Oh, my God. We would never.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.464
I can't believe you'd think that we would
do something like that to our child.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.677
Anything is possible of anyone.
And, unfortunately, I've seen it all.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.470
What's next?

05:46.805 --> 05:51.018
No alcohol on the premises.
No indications of illegal drug use.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.897
One registered firearm in a lockbox
located in detached garage.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.525
Premises clear of food waste,
dust and debris.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.652
So far, so good.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.446
That means she's coming home now?

06:03.405 --> 06:04.406
I still can't say.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.201
Your daughter was trafficked.

06:07.201 --> 06:11.163
The state needs to be sure that Trini's
homelife neither contributed to

06:11.163 --> 06:14.166
nor will further affect
her mental and physical health.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.251
Now, I'll be in touch.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.929
<i>Following Rachel McKegney's announcement
that she is dropping out</i>

06:26.929 --> 06:28.722
<i>of Oakland's mayoral race,</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:32.434
<i>front-runner Andrew Finney's lead
has increased by seven points.</i>

06:32.434 --> 06:34.853
<i>Right now, he looks unstoppable. Now--</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:36.271
He isn't.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.274
His political career will be over
once he's arrested.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.276
From your lips.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.739
There's nothing concrete
linking Finney to the mixers yet,

06:45.739 --> 06:50.118
but almost all of the johns were
on the donor list that we got from Alicia.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.496
One of these guys has to have
more to do with Finney

06:52.496 --> 06:54.957
than just campaign donations.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.837
Maybe it's quid pro quo.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.340
So we just pinpoint
which john helped Finney the most

07:03.340 --> 07:06.176
and who has the most to lose.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.554
Maybe we get him to flip.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.972
A john's testimony,

07:09.972 --> 07:12.099
coupled with the chains
from the Gilded Karat,

07:12.099 --> 07:14.184
might be enough to open a grand jury.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.144
We're close. I can feel it.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.357
Unfortunately,
we're no closer to Emily than we were.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.235
The intel that we've received,
it didn't lead to Emily

07:23.235 --> 07:26.280
or to any evidence of her whereabouts.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.323
How do you know she wasn't
at that mansion?

07:28.323 --> 07:31.159
Could they have moved
Emily before OPD arrived?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.078
Maybe you just got there too late.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.122
I know you wanted us
to find your daughter,

07:35.122 --> 07:38.917
but in a way,
it is a very good thing she was not there.

07:38.917 --> 07:43.422
Poppy Scoville's podcast gave us hope.
A sign that Emily was alive.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.507
She's just a podcaster.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.217
But one you work closely with.

07:51.430 --> 07:55.267
Look. If there is anything there,
we will find it.

07:55.267 --> 07:59.021
Believe me. We're kicking over every rock,
every pebble, every stone.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.272
We should up the reward.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.358
- No, I don't recommend you up the reward.
- I'm calling our accountant.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.494
There is one rock I kicked over
that I wanna speak to you about.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.456
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:18.332 --> 08:23.170
We found cocaine at Victor's cabin,
hidden in deodorant bottles.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.797
Large amounts of cocaine, Peter.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.425
Victor says it's yours.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.136
Of course he said it belongs to me.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.179
He's trying to cover his own ass.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.390
Talk to me
about your offshore bank accounts.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.144
The ones that are being managed by Victor

08:39.144 --> 08:42.606
in exchange for felony-sized cocaine
that isn't yours.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.984
You think I had something to do
with Emily's disappearance?

08:48.570 --> 08:49.863
I get it.

08:50.364 --> 08:54.618
I'm your scapegoat now that your
solid lead turned out to be bullshit.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.371
- Admit it. You fucked up.
- Hey.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.500
I told you, we investigate
every lead no matter how uncomfortable.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.544
The only thing you should
feel uncomfortable about

09:04.044 --> 09:06.296
is your job security, Detective.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.059
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.189
- Des, my diamond.
- Hey.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.149
I thought our falafel run was next week.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.777
Yeah, my father told me about the raid.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.947
I thought the girls could use some clothes

09:31.947 --> 09:34.032
and maybe some toiletries.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.410
I adore you for this.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.912
But most of the girls have been
processed out of this facility,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.956
either to their families or a foster home.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.170
That's Melanie Sanchez.

09:46.170 --> 09:50.674
I've been trying to contact her family,
but I don't think anyone's coming.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.052
Unfortunately, she's been
in and out of our system before.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.097
So where will she go?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.765
An emergency placement.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.770
Between her age and trafficking history,
it's gonna be tough.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.190
We are so low on homes right now.

10:13.405 --> 10:18.952
Your numbers are unreal.
l-- a live podcast.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.664
I had to stop my racquetball game
right then and there just to listen.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.249
Thanks.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.712
There is still a harrowing journey
ahead for those girls.

10:29.922 --> 10:33.050
It's not over until I take down
the head of the trafficking ring.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.470
Your investigative prowess
never ceases to amaze.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.558
There is one thing, though. Emily Mills.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.894
Her parents reached out to me.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.104
Apparently,
they contacted you about your source.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.857
The one who claimed Emily
was at that house?

10:49.775 --> 10:51.068
But they haven't heard back.

10:53.946 --> 10:58.617
Ezra, I can't compromise my sources,

10:58.617 --> 11:00.786
even for worried parents.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.211
If you were back at <i>The New York Times</i>,

11:09.211 --> 11:11.380
you'd be disclosing your sources
to your editor.

11:12.548 --> 11:18.512
No disrespect,
but <i>The New York Times</i> has 132 Pulitzers.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.889
How many does Boisterous have?

11:22.432 --> 11:25.978
I will handle Emily's parents.

11:26.562 --> 11:27.771
But moving forward,

11:27.771 --> 11:32.192
Boisterous will have editorial
oversight of <i>Reconsidered</i>,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.152
and that's including fact-checking.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.529
That wasn't our deal.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.198
Our deal is your contract
has a morals clause

11:38.699 --> 11:41.451
that you agreed to with your signature.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.456
Hey, sweetheart.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.417
Come on in.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.961
Honey, you're home.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.882
- Baby.
- You're home, baby.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.227
She's experienced heavy trauma,
Mr. Killebrew.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.897
- She'll need a gentle approach.
- All right.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.566
Her exam showed signs of sexual assault.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.860
She's also been tattooed.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.988
Probably a result
of her trafficker branding her.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.323
Did she say who raped her?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.992
She identified her assailant
as Bill Ochoa.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.952
He's in custody.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.413
Best believe that motherfucker's
gonna be prosecuted.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.707
What else can you tell us?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.417
I'm sorry, that's all I know.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.129
And I have 19 more cases today,
so I have to get going.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.634
Just know it's gonna take Trini some time
to adjust to being out of the life.

12:40.469 --> 12:44.014
Trini was kidnapped and raped.
She was never in the life.

12:45.474 --> 12:49.394
The life for Trini began
the moment they started grooming her.

12:50.312 --> 12:53.023
And here's the thing you both need
to understand.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.609
Mentally, she's still in it.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.529
Call me with any questions.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.405
Thank you.

13:09.248 --> 13:13.001
Hey, I just got a phone alert
about a press conference.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.837
What's going on?

13:17.381 --> 13:18.590
Aames.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.676
You lied.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.513
I trusted you, and you lied.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.182
I thought you were above that.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.563
I thought if it meant saving them,
we needed to.

13:32.563 --> 13:33.981
We or you?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.859
That wasn't a victimless lie.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.112
I had to look Joana Reynolds in the eye

13:40.112 --> 13:43.574
and tell her that her missing daughter
wasn't there.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.078
Do you want me to tell her
that Emily was just a chess piece

13:48.078 --> 13:50.455
in your larger social fight?

13:50.455 --> 13:52.124
I hate to say it,

13:53.125 --> 13:56.378
but I'd do it again
if it meant saving Trini.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.546
In a heartbeat.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.885
I'm glad Trini's home.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.596
But now she is, we're done.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.849
I'm putting everything into finding Emily.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.226
Aames. Aames.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.145
Excuse me.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.357
Good day.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.237
I want to start by saying congratulations
and thank you to the officers

14:22.237 --> 14:25.490
involved in the rescue
of 15 underage victims

14:25.490 --> 14:27.326
from what appeared to be a sex party.

14:27.993 --> 14:31.371
Unfortunately,
one young girl remains missing.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.664
She was not at the raid,

14:33.332 --> 14:36.084
nor have we recovered evidence
that she was there.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.754
That girl is Emily Mills.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.257
Additionally, because of the rogue actions

14:42.257 --> 14:47.095
of a criminal gang known as the Capstones,
our investigation is facing challenges.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.349
But OPD's investigators
will work tirelessly

14:50.349 --> 14:53.018
to pursue justice
for the girls who were rescued.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.145
Until that time,

14:55.145 --> 14:59.191
the persons arrested in connection
with the alleged crimes at the sex party

14:59.191 --> 15:00.484
have been released on bail.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.695
We won't be taking
any questions right now. Thank you.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.698
They've all lawyered up.

15:06.698 --> 15:11.203
Without a john's testimony,
the DA will be reluctant to bring charges.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.330
What about evidence from the house?

15:13.330 --> 15:17.251
I heard the cops say something
about finding a hidden security camera,

15:17.251 --> 15:19.628
but they haven't been able
to trace where the feed went.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.381
- What about the rape kits?
- Not enough DNA.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.133
The johns must have worn condoms.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.677
So Finney wins.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.146
You know,

15:39.982 --> 15:42.401
these paths to Finney

15:43.610 --> 15:47.364
all focus on the victimizers.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.741
But nothing...

15:51.743 --> 15:54.079
is as powerful as a victim's voice.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.665
But making the girls
testify retraumatizes them,

15:56.665 --> 15:59.376
- so we can't do anyth--
- No. I agree.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.836
They need time to heal.

16:02.671 --> 16:08.218
That's why I'm hoping you might
tell your story on air.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.387
- Me?
- Yes.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.016
You're strong. Smart.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.227
An admired force for good in Oakland.

16:17.227 --> 16:21.315
Coming forward might help open up
an official investigation.

16:21.315 --> 16:24.443
No, honestly, Poppy,
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

16:24.443 --> 16:28.363
I'm still processing. I'm raw. I'm numb.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.451
So much still
doesn't even make any sense to me.

16:33.869 --> 16:36.455
Have you written
about what happened to you?

16:37.372 --> 16:41.460
Putting it all down on paper
might offer you some clarity.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.464
Think about it.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.473
Hey. I got your message. You all right?

16:55.057 --> 16:58.685
How in the fuck is Bill Ochoa released?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.063
I need to know what
that sick bastard did to my daughter.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.649
I want to see his statement.
I want to see his interrogation.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.609
There's nothing to see.
He denied everything.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.070
Then give me his arrest file then.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.449
- For what?
- The fucking guy is a predator, a monster.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.618
And he needs to be dealt with accordingly.
Right the fuck now.

17:15.618 --> 17:18.329
Markus, just go home. Go home.
Be with your family, please--

17:18.329 --> 17:21.290
If you don't have a problem
with these fuckers

17:21.290 --> 17:24.294
who rape kids and just get to make bail,

17:25.587 --> 17:27.839
then OPD really is the place for you.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.721
I don't even know where to start.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.390
What am I supposed to say?

17:36.390 --> 17:40.811
"Once upon a time, there was a dumbass
who gave the best BJs in the Bay."

17:41.478 --> 17:44.064
This only works if you take it seriously.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.525
I just don't think that recording
my messy life is the answer.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.987
Okay, so why don't you start
with a success story?

17:51.864 --> 17:53.740
Do I have one from back then?

17:56.076 --> 17:56.910
Debate Club.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.163
I watched you kick the living shit

18:00.163 --> 18:02.958
out of some skinny white boy's
pro-death penalty platform.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.459
Spencer Loeb.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.589
His argument was unfounded.
The death penalty is not a deterrent.

18:08.589 --> 18:13.760
Point is you slayed him
and every other smug-ass boy in the Bay.

18:14.595 --> 18:16.221
God. That was so long ago.

18:17.181 --> 18:21.059
You are still the same strong girl
that I met back in the day.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.816
But we both know that some memories,

18:27.816 --> 18:31.945
some mistakes are better left
in the rearview.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.906
- But Finney i--
- All that I'm saying

18:34.489 --> 18:39.453
is that if you are gonna do this,
it's gotta be about you, Eva.

18:39.453 --> 18:40.871
Nobody else.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.132
The agency is reaching out to your mom.

18:52.716 --> 18:57.012
But I thought until then,
we'd make you comfortable.

18:59.556 --> 19:03.310
All yours.
I want you to feel at home, Melanie.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.062
This ain't my home.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.397
- You're right.
- Yeah. I just--

19:07.397 --> 19:10.025
I wanna keep my stuff in my bag,
in case my mom comes.

19:11.527 --> 19:12.528
Absolutely.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.744
I love and miss my mom too.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.373
She passed when I was younger than you.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.795
And if I sit still long enough
and close my eyes,

19:29.795 --> 19:31.588
I can smell her perfume.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.967
Gives me comfort.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.679
There's nothing like the love
between a mother and a daughter.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.889
Can I get ready for bed?

19:44.726 --> 19:47.020
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Yep.

21:22.616 --> 21:23.617
God!

21:24.910 --> 21:26.245
God!

21:29.081 --> 21:30.332
Trini. Baby.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.750
- No. Hey!
- No!

21:36.588 --> 21:37.422
Baby.

21:38.215 --> 21:43.178
It's me, okay? It's Daddy. I'm here.

21:45.556 --> 21:50.811
Please. Let me help you. Okay? Please.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.110
Lennon, I don't have time for this.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.153
Make some time.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.699
Your vice principal
filed an official complaint

22:03.699 --> 22:05.742
with me because of your absences.

22:06.243 --> 22:07.411
Can you blame her?

22:07.411 --> 22:11.123
She's had to pick up the slack
every time you run away from campus.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.959
I'm not running away.
I'm trying to help our students.

22:13.959 --> 22:18.505
You mean you're not running away
with Poppy Scoville all this time?

22:18.505 --> 22:21.675
Her podcast is making the school look bad.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.012
What do you want, Lennon?
Why are you here?

22:26.054 --> 22:28.307
Distance yourself from Poppy.

22:29.808 --> 22:33.645
If not,
I may not be able to protect your job.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.314
Hey, sweetheart. It's Dad.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.527
You don't have to let me in
or anything like that.

23:23.904 --> 23:27.032
But I just want you
to know how much I love you.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.871
And I would do anything for you.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.917
Anything in this world.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.379
I just want you to be okay.

23:48.345 --> 23:49.346
All right.

23:52.975 --> 23:53.976
Come here.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.021
Come here. I know.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.242
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.578
I have worked so hard to get where I am.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.705
No. I gotta protect that.

24:14.705 --> 24:16.707
If I talk to the police, lawyers,

24:16.707 --> 24:20.085
anybody about Finney,
I could lose everything.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.879
I already got the superintendent
threatening my job.

24:21.879 --> 24:23.714
You don't have to explain yourself.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.429
My students.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.723
God, my faculty.

24:37.186 --> 24:39.438
All the world will see is a dirty ho.

24:39.438 --> 24:40.939
Eva, don't worry.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.400
Look at all we've done.

24:45.152 --> 24:48.363
If there's another way to get Finney,
we'll find it.

24:49.198 --> 24:50.991
It's like he's always one step
ahead of us.

24:52.451 --> 24:56.705
I come from a long line of fighters.
It's in my blood.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.708
We're a long way from being done.

25:00.417 --> 25:01.877
A long way.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.134
So how's Trini?

25:12.554 --> 25:15.724
Tell you the truth,
I got no clue. You know?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.810
She hasn't said a word
to either one of us.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.773
It's like she's still trapped
in that house,

25:24.274 --> 25:25.609
and I just can't get to her.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.861
I'm so sorry.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.988
Look...

25:34.034 --> 25:36.036
This is Chheng Sok.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.330
She's a social worker

25:38.330 --> 25:41.416
who specializes in trafficking survivors.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.876
Maybe she can help.

25:45.921 --> 25:48.674
- Thanks, Pop. Really.
- Of course.

25:49.925 --> 25:50.968
Of course.

25:53.387 --> 25:54.972
Can I ask you something?

25:55.472 --> 25:56.807
Andrew Finney?

25:56.807 --> 26:01.103
How is it that
that man ran a whole trafficking ring

26:01.103 --> 26:04.189
and there's never even been
a whisper of a charge against him?

26:04.189 --> 26:05.607
It's corruption.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.652
These cats, they create these foundations,

26:08.652 --> 26:12.239
and they funnel money
to the police department.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.490
And in return?

26:14.449 --> 26:16.493
They get to do whatever they want.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.746
Some of the cops,
they tamper with evidence.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.456
They manipulate witnesses.

26:22.791 --> 26:26.295
It's damn near impossible
to prosecute a case

26:26.295 --> 26:27.921
if the cops are working against you.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.300
We need to find someone
who can get into OPD.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.761
Someone trustworthy,

26:34.761 --> 26:38.849
but someone they'd underestimate.

26:50.277 --> 26:53.780
It's a gray sweater with a flower
on the right shoulder.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.034
It's my daughter's.

26:57.534 --> 27:02.206
I was told I could retrieve it now
that her case is closed.

27:03.665 --> 27:08.462
Okay, here we go. Drea Spivey.
Case number 0071721.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.547
Sign there.

27:45.958 --> 27:47.668
You got beets on your salad?

27:47.668 --> 27:50.504
Excuse you, it's healthy.

27:50.504 --> 27:53.924
Whatever. I hope you don't
force Melanie to eat that too.

27:53.924 --> 27:55.175
I might.

27:56.468 --> 27:59.638
And how is she? Since, you know?

28:00.931 --> 28:01.807
I can't tell yet.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.143
It's tough,
but I think she's just sussing me out.

28:05.978 --> 28:07.855
And I couldn't sleep at all last night.

28:08.522 --> 28:10.607
I kept sneaking in to check on her.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.151
- Is that crazy?
- No.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.571
I just want her to like me.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.823
Okay. But those beets not gonna help.

28:19.116 --> 28:23.078
- Hey, Mel. You can get anything you want.
- Anything?

28:24.288 --> 28:26.665
Avoid the wings. You'll thank me later.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.086
- By the way, Lillian called me.
- Yeah.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.589
- Okay.
- She said Daddy's not taking his meds.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.135
He'll take them if he needs to.

28:41.471 --> 28:42.514
He's fine.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.893
He does things his way.
That's why he's a leader.

28:45.893 --> 28:48.729
Yeah and that's why his CTE
is getting worse.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.772
Trust me. I got him.

28:51.273 --> 28:52.900
You just worry about that new child.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.528
I know.

28:57.654 --> 28:58.697
You still got my number?

28:58.697 --> 28:59.615
What the fuck?

29:00.490 --> 29:01.742
- Is--
- Oh, my God.

29:02.868 --> 29:05.454
- Excuse me? Hey! Get away from her.
- I--

29:05.454 --> 29:08.248
- She's just a kid, you bitch-ass pervert.
- Yo, yo--

29:08.248 --> 29:10.000
- Are you okay?
- In the food court?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.669
- Really? Where's security?
- I'm so sorry, Melanie.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.922
I took my eyes off you for one second
and this guy came--

29:14.922 --> 29:18.133
He was gonna pay me double. Okay?
You know what that means, right?

29:18.133 --> 29:22.554
Listen to me.
That dude does not determine your worth.

29:22.554 --> 29:25.516
That's right.
You have so much more to offer.

29:25.516 --> 29:28.727
Just stop. Okay? You're not my mom.

29:36.985 --> 29:40.822
The needle and floss
from the motel was signed in as evidence,

29:40.822 --> 29:44.576
checked out two hours later,
but it was never checked back in.

29:46.370 --> 29:50.374
OPD has a dirty cop. Maybe more than one.

29:52.251 --> 29:54.753
Drea always said
she didn't trust the police.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.505
Now I know why.

29:59.883 --> 30:01.301
Is everything okay?

30:02.094 --> 30:04.721
I may have
to do something I didn't want to do.

30:05.514 --> 30:07.975
I need to talk to one
of the girls from the mixer.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.609
Look at what he's done to her!

30:17.609 --> 30:19.361
You have got to stop obsessing over him!

30:19.361 --> 30:21.029
He needs to pay for what he did!

30:22.739 --> 30:24.116
Honey.

30:24.116 --> 30:25.284
Hey, sweetheart.

30:26.118 --> 30:29.413
- I'm sorry for yelling like that.
- Got all your favorites for dinner.

30:29.413 --> 30:31.248
- A little bit more in the oven.
- Yeah.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.000
What do you think? You hungry?

30:35.002 --> 30:37.880
I don't know what you just heard.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.550
I just don't want you to be scared.

30:43.385 --> 30:45.012
And I want you to trust me.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.806
We're gonna get the guy
that did this to you,

30:48.599 --> 30:50.392
and we're gonna put him away.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.687
- Sweetheart. Baby.
- Hey.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.107
You really shouldn't have done that.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.193
- She doesn't wanna hear about that man.
- Z,

30:59.193 --> 31:01.862
the best shot we have at moving on begins

31:01.862 --> 31:04.615
with Bill behind bars,
and that's it, period.

31:04.615 --> 31:07.284
You're doing it again.
You're going into action mode.

31:07.284 --> 31:10.913
The caseworker told us
that we need to approach Trini gently.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.415
That is how we get her
to connect with her emotions.

31:15.751 --> 31:18.003
But how do we get her to connect with us?

31:24.927 --> 31:26.803
I don't know what to do.
She's not answering her phone.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.388
Okay, calm down. What happened?

31:28.388 --> 31:30.974
We went to bed, and then I woke up.

31:30.974 --> 31:32.768
When I went to check on Melanie,
she was gone.

31:32.768 --> 31:34.478
- So she snuck out?
- Cy,

31:34.478 --> 31:37.439
what if she's with that guy?
The dude from the food court?

31:37.439 --> 31:39.233
Let's not assume shit right now.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.985
Maybe she went to hang with some friends.

31:41.985 --> 31:43.445
But you heard her.

31:43.445 --> 31:46.990
She was
proud of how much he was offering her!

31:46.990 --> 31:48.325
Yeah, I know.

31:49.368 --> 31:52.496
It's just gonna take some time for her
to stop thinking of herself like that.

31:53.163 --> 31:54.790
Time and therapy.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.167
I couldn't even keep her safe for one day.

31:58.335 --> 32:00.629
Oh, my God! Where have you been?

32:00.629 --> 32:02.798
Des, chill. Just give her a minute.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.509
I wasn't with that dude
if that's what you thought.

32:05.509 --> 32:09.388
She did.
I thought you were with some friends.

32:09.388 --> 32:13.058
I told you. Before foster care,
I lived with my mom and her boyfriend.

32:13.559 --> 32:19.147
So I went home, back to our house,
but wasn't nobody there.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.400
It was all boarded up.

32:26.029 --> 32:27.489
I'm so sorry, Melanie.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.786
Where'd she go? Where's my mom at?

32:33.996 --> 32:34.997
I don't know.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.833
But you don't have
to worry about that right now.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.710
Okay? We'll figure that out.

32:41.837 --> 32:45.132
I ain't never had someone
step up for me the way you guys did.

32:48.385 --> 32:51.346
My mom's boyfriend
the one who got me into the life.

32:54.224 --> 32:55.434
And when I told her...

32:58.645 --> 33:00.272
she didn't even believe me.

33:06.862 --> 33:10.073
My mom's not coming back for me, is she?

33:11.950 --> 33:13.619
I can't answer that.

33:20.209 --> 33:22.211
I don't got no-fucking-body.

33:22.211 --> 33:25.714
No. You got me.

33:26.882 --> 33:31.803
And I'm not going anywhere.
Okay? I promise.

33:36.308 --> 33:41.647
You got me too.
And I'm a damn good auntie.

33:47.444 --> 33:50.906
I have seen tremendous recovery results

33:50.906 --> 33:54.243
for trafficking survivors
through inpatient residential treatment.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.120
Wait. She'd have to leave us again?

33:57.120 --> 33:58.830
How long would she have to stay?

33:59.498 --> 34:01.667
That would depend on Trini.

34:01.667 --> 34:05.420
But I can tell you
that the primary benefit

34:05.420 --> 34:08.340
is removing the survivor
from active triggers.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.717
Social media, her trafficker.

34:10.717 --> 34:15.054
Being away from all that would
give her distance and space to heal.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.931
Where is this recovery program?

34:16.931 --> 34:19.393
Personally,
I think the best treatment center

34:19.393 --> 34:22.521
for Trini is in Jackson, Wyoming.

34:25.774 --> 34:28.527
- Is there a website we can look at?
- Yeah.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.579
Pop, I don't want you questioning her.

34:38.579 --> 34:41.498
I'm just trying to create
a safe space for Mel here.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.125
I wanna talk.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.418
I feel bad I didn't help before.

34:46.837 --> 34:49.380
<i>After the raid,
the police asked me questions.</i>

34:50.215 --> 34:54.344
And I kept saying I didn't know.
But I do know.

34:58.599 --> 35:00.434
I was afraid that if I said anything,

35:01.185 --> 35:02.394
they would tell their friends.

35:02.978 --> 35:05.606
Their friends? You mean other cops?

35:07.357 --> 35:09.902
How do you know cops
were involved in the mixers?

35:09.902 --> 35:12.946
I would hear my man-- my pimp,

35:13.697 --> 35:16.283
talking on the phone
with some dude about the mixers.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.118
He said he was a cop.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.703
Did you get a name?

35:19.703 --> 35:21.413
They called him Cubo.

35:23.415 --> 35:26.710
One time, I asked him
why they called him that,

35:26.710 --> 35:29.004
and he told me the dude was a dirty cop.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.424
I thought that term sounded familiar.

35:32.424 --> 35:36.678
"Conduct Unbecoming of an Officer."
That's what CUBO means.

35:36.678 --> 35:38.847
Can you tell us anything else?

35:44.728 --> 35:45.771
Trains.

35:46.605 --> 35:49.608
Trains? What do you mean, honey?

35:49.608 --> 35:53.070
Cubo lived by a BART station.

35:53.070 --> 35:55.280
I could hear it sometimes on speaker.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.284
That probably
doesn't help you, though. So...

35:59.284 --> 36:02.538
No, it could, Melanie. Thank you.

36:03.455 --> 36:07.709
- You are so brave. Truly.
- She's right.

36:08.293 --> 36:11.797
I've interviewed firefighters,
Marines and others,

36:11.797 --> 36:15.217
and they didn't have half your courage.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.052
I'm trying.

36:18.929 --> 36:21.306
It's been really hard, you know?

36:21.807 --> 36:26.436
But Desiree's been helping me.

36:31.942 --> 36:34.152
I'm just so sick of being scared.

36:45.330 --> 36:47.416
Hey. Beignets?

36:47.416 --> 36:49.376
You're trying to bribe me
with fried dough?

36:49.376 --> 36:50.794
Cold fried dough?

36:50.794 --> 36:53.922
I know you hate me right now,
but I really need to tell you something.

36:53.922 --> 36:55.007
Please.

36:57.426 --> 37:01.847
I think OPD may be involved
with this new trafficking ring.

37:01.847 --> 37:03.098
Unbelievable.

37:03.098 --> 37:07.686
Evidence went missing. From Drea's case.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.359
The needle and floss we found
at the motel, it's gone.

37:15.444 --> 37:17.821
I'm sure there is a simple explanation

37:17.821 --> 37:20.824
that doesn't involve
multi-level conspiracy theories.

37:20.824 --> 37:22.159
Melanie said cops--

37:27.331 --> 37:30.167
Melanie said the cops knew
about the mixers.

37:30.167 --> 37:34.087
At least one did.
You know what CUBO means?

37:34.087 --> 37:36.215
Conduct Unbecoming of an Officer.

37:36.757 --> 37:40.260
That was her pimp's nickname
for a guy he used to talk to.

37:41.303 --> 37:43.430
He may live near a BART station?

37:47.184 --> 37:48.393
You okay?

37:49.478 --> 37:54.233
No, I'm not okay.
I got that sick feeling in my gut.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.443
That same one I had at SFPD.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.445
God, I'm sorry.

37:59.863 --> 38:03.951
I really am. I will make this up to you.

38:04.618 --> 38:08.080
And Emily's family. I promise.

38:09.831 --> 38:10.916
We okay?

38:14.878 --> 38:17.089
These are a pretty decent start.

38:23.554 --> 38:24.888
Thank you all for coming.

38:25.931 --> 38:28.392
The Golden State Originals

38:28.392 --> 38:31.854
and the PCH Riders
are all feeling the squeeze

38:31.854 --> 38:35.107
from this anti-gang initiative
Finney's running on,

38:35.107 --> 38:36.859
giving OPD reason to lock us down.

38:37.651 --> 38:39.778
Now, his grip is only
gonna get tighter if he wins.

38:40.362 --> 38:41.989
Now what can we do?

38:41.989 --> 38:43.991
I need y'all to dip into your pockets.

38:43.991 --> 38:46.660
We gotta post bail,
get our brothers back on the streets.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.788
OPD holding them
on some trumped-up bullshit.

38:50.998 --> 38:53.417
- Can we help you with something?
- I'm with Building and Safety.

38:53.417 --> 38:56.044
- What is this?
- It's a notice of noncompliance

38:56.044 --> 38:57.629
on your ramp and handrails.

38:57.629 --> 39:00.632
If your building isn't ADA certified
in 45 days,

39:00.632 --> 39:02.634
- we'll shut it down.
- Is this a joke?

39:03.218 --> 39:04.553
You can't do that!

39:05.596 --> 39:07.973
There's been a squad car
out front all day.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.766
Y'all are harassing us.

39:09.766 --> 39:13.896
You can take this bullshit fine
and get the hell out of our bar!

39:13.896 --> 39:15.314
Bye-bye.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.026
Greedy motherfucker.

39:21.987 --> 39:25.324
Daddy? Daddy?

39:26.450 --> 39:27.284
Yeah.

39:29.912 --> 39:33.916
Y'all see that?
Finney's coming for The Knock.

39:33.916 --> 39:38.253
Our business.
The heartbeat of the Capstones.

39:38.837 --> 39:43.550
And he'll come for all of us.
So let's go, dip into them pockets!

39:50.224 --> 39:52.518
Your father and I contacted

39:52.518 --> 39:55.062
the treatment center
recommended by Ms. Sok.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.898
We bought tickets
for a flight out tomorrow.

39:59.858 --> 40:03.320
It's called Bloom House.
It's a ten-week program.

40:04.071 --> 40:07.699
We get two visitation weekends.
And as soon as we're allowed,

40:07.699 --> 40:10.285
we'll be on the first flight out
to see you in Wyoming.

40:12.996 --> 40:14.206
This'll be good.

40:15.374 --> 40:19.127
I looked online, and the pictures... beautiful.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.255
Right on a lake.

40:23.966 --> 40:26.552
The time will fly by, you'll see.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.222
You'll be feeling better in no time.

40:41.483 --> 40:44.653
Are you ashamed of me?
Is that why you're sending me away?

40:44.653 --> 40:47.447
What? No. No!

40:47.447 --> 40:49.449
You don't trust me now.

40:50.284 --> 40:52.327
You look at me differently. I can tell.

40:52.327 --> 40:57.541
You think that I'm... dirty.

40:57.541 --> 41:00.085
Hey. I don't think that at all.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.632
But I do look at you differently.

41:06.216 --> 41:07.801
Because you are different.

41:09.595 --> 41:12.055
When somebody goes through
what you went through, it changes them.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.265
It has to.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.559
But you know what doesn't change?

41:16.143 --> 41:21.273
What will never change is my love for you.

41:24.151 --> 41:26.403
Okay, you don't know what happened.

41:26.403 --> 41:29.156
No. No, I don't.

41:31.074 --> 41:32.826
But here's what I do know.

41:36.246 --> 41:39.875
God gave you to me and your dad,

41:41.627 --> 41:43.754
and I am forever grateful.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.342
Then why all of the locks and sensors?

41:48.342 --> 41:50.344
Honey, we don't know how to help you.

41:51.762 --> 41:54.598
But I wanna help. Tell me how.

41:56.350 --> 41:57.809
Don't send me away.

42:00.354 --> 42:03.273
I want to stay home with you, please.

42:03.273 --> 42:05.651
Okay. That's what we'll do.

42:06.777 --> 42:09.446
We're gonna do this together, as a family.

42:11.156 --> 42:14.159
Okay? Okay. Come here.

42:14.826 --> 42:16.870
Come here, honey. Yeah.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.665
I got you, baby.

42:20.582 --> 42:21.583
I got you.

42:34.346 --> 42:37.015
Admit it. The peanut butter bomb

42:37.015 --> 42:39.351
added to the pomegranate-oat dream
is on point.

42:41.311 --> 42:43.480
I really missed
these insightful conversations

42:43.480 --> 42:44.898
when you were on leave.

42:49.862 --> 42:51.238
It's definitely suss Peter has time

42:51.238 --> 42:53.657
to hit the weights
while his stepdaughter's missing.

42:58.912 --> 43:01.039
- Hey, Peter. What the fuck, man?
- What the hell?

43:01.039 --> 43:04.084
- I want my money. I mean it.
- Yeah, you'll get your money.

43:04.084 --> 43:06.587
- I mean it. Don't walk away from me.
- Get out of my way.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.046
Don't fuck with me.

43:11.967 --> 43:13.093
Who the fuck was that?

43:13.594 --> 43:14.761
No idea.

43:15.762 --> 43:16.972
Asshole.

43:18.098 --> 43:19.558
Did you get the make of the car?

43:20.058 --> 43:24.021
Silver Hyundai. First letters, 8XW.

43:24.021 --> 43:26.565
Let's run it through the system.
May get lucky.

43:27.191 --> 43:30.235
- Can we swing by my place first?
- Yeah, sure. Where is it?

43:30.235 --> 43:31.486
Mandela and Seventh.

43:34.531 --> 43:36.617
- Is that near a BART station?
- Yeah.

43:37.326 --> 43:39.828
Horns blaring and wheels squealing
all the damn time.

43:40.329 --> 43:43.123
But I got a sweet deal on my condo,
so I ain't movin' anytime soon.

43:45.334 --> 43:46.835
Fucking trains, huh?

44:00.057 --> 44:05.854
<i>After the storm.
From darkness to light. Post trauma.</i>

44:05.854 --> 44:11.401
<i>All of these could describe the period
following rescue from sex trafficking.</i>

44:12.319 --> 44:13.779
<i>The girls recently rescued</i>

44:13.779 --> 44:17.282
<i>from sex traffickers
in Claremont Hills are victims.</i>

44:17.991 --> 44:20.536
<i>They are also survivors.</i>

44:21.370 --> 44:24.748
<i>But in order to heal, they'll need support</i>

44:24.748 --> 44:29.878
<i>from family, friends, teachers--
from all of us.</i>

44:29.878 --> 44:32.673
<i>We need to do our part</i>

44:32.673 --> 44:38.011
<i>in ensuring that these children
not only survive but thrive.</i>

44:38.720 --> 44:44.434
<i>That means comforting, encouraging,
listening to and believing in them.</i>

44:45.018 --> 44:48.856
It's said, "The truth is like a lion.

44:49.982 --> 44:53.694
Let it loose, and it will defend itself."

44:55.571 --> 44:59.199
I say, except when it can't.

45:00.450 --> 45:04.872
<i>As you've learned in the news,
15 young girls were rescued</i>

45:04.872 --> 45:08.208
<i>from an underage sex party
here in Oakland.</i>

45:09.459 --> 45:14.339
<i>Powerful men, leaders even,
are the victimizers involved.</i>

45:14.339 --> 45:19.428
<i>And as of this moment,
not a single one remains in jail.</i>

45:19.428 --> 45:21.180
Daddy!

45:21.180 --> 45:24.016
<i>There may be no lion here.</i>

45:25.642 --> 45:31.190
<i>Only young girls who,
in addition to support, deserve justice.</i>

45:31.190 --> 45:37.196
<i>And the only way they're going to get it
is if the truth is defended.</i>

45:38.363 --> 45:42.910
The question remains,
if it's not all of us,

45:43.660 --> 45:46.872
who will defend the truth in the wake

45:46.872 --> 45:51.210
of the atrocities inflicted
on these young girls?

46:04.723 --> 46:09.436
Aames and I are working to uncover
who at OPD is in Finney's pocket.

46:10.896 --> 46:13.023
We got a case if we can get them to talk.

46:18.946 --> 46:20.322
I'm ready to talk.

46:20.906 --> 46:22.991
The ones who go before us make us brave.

46:22.991 --> 46:25.285
Oprah, Michelle Obama, Kamala.

46:25.285 --> 46:28.288
They all talk about standing
on the shoulders of their ancestors.

46:30.624 --> 46:34.336
I guess I never expected to be standing
on the shoulders of children.

46:35.337 --> 46:36.755
Drea and Melanie.

46:37.381 --> 46:39.758
There's no way in hell
I could ask them to speak up

46:41.218 --> 46:42.511
if I couldn't.

46:43.095 --> 46:45.222
What about the school? Your job?

46:47.432 --> 46:50.644
It's worth it if I can get him
to stop hurting

46:50.644 --> 46:52.646
any other girl the way that he hurt me.

46:55.357 --> 46:57.109
I do have to warn you, Poppy...

46:59.695 --> 47:01.280
I'm not the perfect victim.
