For instance, you.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.754
You seem way too intelligent

25:38.798 --> 25:41.496
to be taking so much lip
off your crew.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.151
They know who calls the shots.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.893
-[slurps]
-I'm sure they do.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.590
[Remy grunts softly]

25:48.634 --> 25:51.245
Maybe instead of focusing on me,

25:51.288 --> 25:53.813
you should focus on what's gonna
happen to your crew

25:53.856 --> 25:55.989
if you don't give us
the codes we want.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.513
Look, I don't want to tell you
how to do your job. It...

26:00.471 --> 26:02.082
Okay.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.214
Come here.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.177
The Federation
is perfectly happy to ignore

26:10.220 --> 26:12.222
whatever happens
outside of Federation space,

26:12.266 --> 26:15.530
but then you go
and you hijack their flagship?

26:15.574 --> 26:18.925
You just know the entire fleet's
coming after you.

26:18.968 --> 26:22.493
Before they catch us,
we'll have sold your ship.

26:22.537 --> 26:26.541
A lot of people in the quadrant
who'd pay a high price for it.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.631
Do those people really want the
Federation coming after them?

26:29.675 --> 26:32.982
-'Cause that's
what they'd be buying, too.
-No.

26:33.026 --> 26:36.638
-The ship
isn't all we have to sell.
-PIKE: Mm?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.988
Wonder what the Klingons
would pay

26:39.032 --> 26:41.164
for some Federation slave labor?

26:43.036 --> 26:45.125
The Klingons.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.606
Yeah,

26:47.649 --> 26:50.652
well, you know
why people like you

26:50.696 --> 26:53.089
don't get into deals
with the Klingons.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.352
It's 'cause they tend
not to get out alive.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.573
I know what I'm doing.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.009
PIKE:
Okay.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.194
[Aspen exhales]

27:12.587 --> 27:14.197
Thank you.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.808
You are fortunate
their weapon was set to stun.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.679
They clearly want
to capture us alive.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.073
I guess they'd rather ransom us
than kill us.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.651
The commander's security
lockdown is still in place.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.870
However, our invaders
have secured access

27:34.914 --> 27:37.220
-to all ship levels.
-What about the escape pods?

27:37.264 --> 27:40.136
Abandoning a ship as powerful
as the Enterpriseto criminals

27:40.180 --> 27:41.660
is not an acceptable option.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.183
We must retake the ship.

27:43.226 --> 27:46.577
You do not want to get captured
by these people.

27:49.145 --> 27:52.192
Your affect suggests
a more personal connection

27:52.235 --> 27:54.542
to our adversaries
than previously disclosed.

27:56.109 --> 27:59.852
My husband directed
refugee relocation efforts

27:59.895 --> 28:01.375
to Federation colonies.

28:02.898 --> 28:05.771
The Squall
raided one of his transports.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.339
He fought back. He lost.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.211
It's why I left Starfleet.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.648
You entered your current line
of work to honor your husband.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.086
He was Vulcan.
Skipped his Kolinahr.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.567
He was torn.

28:19.610 --> 28:23.614
I'd tell him to stop worrying
if he was being too emotional,

28:23.658 --> 28:25.616
too logical.

28:25.660 --> 28:28.750
Logic probably told him
to fight back that day.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.187
I wish

28:31.231 --> 28:34.016
he would've let himself
be scared.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.894
We need to abandon ship.

28:46.028 --> 28:48.770
-SPOCK: The Jefferies tubes
will get us to Engineering.
-[door whooshes open]

28:48.814 --> 28:52.078
-[door whooshes shut]
-From there, I can override
the security lockdown

28:52.121 --> 28:53.601
and redirect ship systems

28:53.644 --> 28:56.038
in order to send a distress call
to Starfleet.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.565
I'm not a fighter, Spock.

29:01.609 --> 29:04.046
Based upon what you just shared,
Counselor,

29:04.090 --> 29:06.222
I believe you
to be wholly incorrect.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.975
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

29:21.847 --> 29:24.153
Oh, hey, guys.
[grunts]

29:24.197 --> 29:25.589
[indistinct chatter]

29:25.633 --> 29:28.810
-[grunts]
-[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

29:28.854 --> 29:31.291
[groans]
How's everybody doing? You good?

29:31.334 --> 29:32.683
M'BENGA:
Let me examine you.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.904
Good news.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.341
-Your head is not scrambled.
-Yeah, well, more good news.

29:38.385 --> 29:41.170
I convinced these guys
to sell us to the Klingons.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.825
You sure
that thing's not broken?

29:43.869 --> 29:46.262
-Let me check.
-N-No, I'm-I'm fine. Trust me.

29:46.306 --> 29:48.351
The captain thought
selling us to the Klingons

29:48.395 --> 29:50.789
was a great idea.
Rest of the crew?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.268
Not so much.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.706
Oh, Chris.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.013
Oh, no.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.668
-Not Alpha Braga IV.
-[Pike chuckles]

30:00.711 --> 30:02.017
Oh, yeah.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.150
-Alpha Braga IV.
-LA'AN: Um,

30:04.193 --> 30:07.066
what's Alpha Braga IV?

30:07.109 --> 30:10.721
We're starting a mutiny.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.429
-[beeping]
-COMPUTER: Access denied.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.304
Access denied.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.831
[Chapel exhales]

30:33.832 --> 30:35.398
Happy to see you, too.

30:35.442 --> 30:36.791
Your handiwork?

30:37.792 --> 30:39.402
You seem surprised.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.841
I've been trying to send
a distress call to Starfleet,

30:42.884 --> 30:45.539
-but it won't let me.
-SPOCK: I can lift the lockdown

30:45.582 --> 30:48.107
so we may command the ship
from Engineering.

30:48.150 --> 30:51.588
It'll buy us some time
for Starfleet to send backup.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.069
Computer, this is
ranking officer Lieutenant Spock

30:54.113 --> 30:55.592
commanding you
to override security lockdown.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.768
Access code
Spock gamma-delta-two.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.858
COMPUTER:
Access granted.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.860
Transfer all command systems
from Bridge to Engineering.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.862
COMPUTER:
Command systems transferred.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.254
-Seal Engineering doors.
-[doors lock]

31:06.255 --> 31:08.127
COMPUTER:
Engineering sealed.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.042
I will scan the area for the
location of the Serene Squall.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.305
Nurse Chapel,
can you access communications?

31:12.348 --> 31:14.873
-Working on it.
-Dr. Aspen, can you check
the transporter system?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.700
I want to know if we can bring
the crew back to Enterprise

31:16.744 --> 31:18.311
before they realize
we're in control.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.921
-Checking.
-Wait.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.923
Comms just rerouted back
to the bridge.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.969
Not just comms. All systems.

31:24.012 --> 31:26.319
CHAPEL:
Engineering doors
are no longer sealed.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.842
What?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.021
Dr. Aspen?

31:33.065 --> 31:34.980
Angel, actually.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.330
Captain Angel.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.681
The Serene Squallis your ship.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.204
[chuckles]

31:42.248 --> 31:45.120
And now so is the Enterprise.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.306
Your deception
was quite thorough.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.308
Oh, no, you feel betrayed.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.006
I hate it when that happens.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.572
You're so cute, too.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.661
Feelings are not my concern.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.447
-Only the safety
of the Enterpriseand her crew.
-No feelings

32:07.490 --> 32:09.666
even without a Kolinahr.
Impressive.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.407
Where's the real Dr. Aspen now?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.409
Probably still wandering around

32:13.453 --> 32:15.194
the uninhabited planet
I dumped them on.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.631
What?
It's not like I killed them.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.111
-Where are the colonists?
-Oh.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.156
Them? Imaginary.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.811
I made them up.
I told a nice, little story

32:23.854 --> 32:25.508
that I knew
would bring you out here,

32:25.552 --> 32:26.640
and you believed me.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.903
Frankly, that's on you.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.775
[exhales]
All right.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.603
[neck pops]

32:33.647 --> 32:35.736
Let's see
what this thing can do.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.695
Fire phasers.

32:39.696 --> 32:42.351
-[whoops, laughs]
-[pirates laugh]

32:42.395 --> 32:44.353
Oh, this is fun.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.964
SPOCK:
What is your objective?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.226
You have control of the ship.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.358
-Why are we still alive?
-Spock.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.056
I have
an extremely logical reason.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.971
I'm enjoying your fancy ship,

32:53.014 --> 32:56.278
but I didn't actually come here
for the Enterprise.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.628
I came for you, Spock.

32:58.672 --> 33:01.501
Whatever information you want,
I will not provide it.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.677
I don't need any information.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.941
All I need is for you to just...

33:06.985 --> 33:08.421
keep being you.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.000
STONN:
T'Pring.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.177
A subspace transmission for you
from the Enterprise.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.961
Thank you, Stonn.

33:30.051 --> 33:31.792
Who are you?

33:31.835 --> 33:34.925
T'Pring. Nice to meet you.

33:34.969 --> 33:38.364
Got to say,
you are very attractive

33:38.407 --> 33:39.669
for a prison guard.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.193
Ankeshtan K'til is not a prison.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.933
It's a rehabilitation center.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.371
Whatever. Pok tar, pok tah.
Gonna cut to the chase.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.981
I've got a captive here.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.896
Spock. I...
[gasps]

33:48.939 --> 33:50.550
I think you know him.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.166
Conveniently,

33:58.210 --> 34:00.690
you are holding
a friend of mine prisoner.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.083
A Vulcan named Xaverius.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.303
How about an even trade?

34:04.346 --> 34:06.131
Vulcan for Vulcan?

34:06.174 --> 34:08.568
I am sure you are aware
that if I were to free him,

34:08.611 --> 34:10.744
the high council
would revoke my position,

34:10.787 --> 34:12.267
I would face criminal charges

34:12.311 --> 34:14.182
and disgrace my family.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.836
But you are bonded to Spock
by ritual engagement,

34:15.879 --> 34:19.492
are you not? Which makes him
your responsibility.

34:19.535 --> 34:22.538
So, you can endure

34:22.582 --> 34:25.454
the stigma
of losing a prisoner...

34:26.455 --> 34:29.937
...or the stigma of letting
one of Vulcan's favorite sons,

34:29.980 --> 34:33.549
your one true love, die.

34:33.593 --> 34:36.204
Like I said, potato, po-tah-toe.

34:36.248 --> 34:39.164
Intimidation will not influence
my decisions.

34:39.207 --> 34:41.905
Okay. I'm transmitting
coordinates anyway.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.821
The Enterprisewill meet you
at the edge of Federation space

34:44.865 --> 34:46.649
to make the exchange.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.261
Oh, and if you choose
to involve the Federation...

34:49.304 --> 34:51.915
[chuckles]

34:51.959 --> 34:53.395
Trust me,

34:53.439 --> 34:55.963
you won't have a fiancé left
to rescue.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.577
Set a course.

35:01.621 --> 35:04.580
We've got a date
with Mr. Spock's girlfriend.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.278
She just told you
she's not gonna do it.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.888
She'll comply.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.412
Vulcans are not swayed
by emotions.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.067
Seriously?

35:13.111 --> 35:17.071
I've been using emotion
to sway you all day.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.421
Oh, those poor,

35:19.465 --> 35:22.294
sick colonists.
[gasps]

35:22.337 --> 35:24.513
My tragic love lost in battle.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.125
[cries mockingly]

35:30.128 --> 35:33.174
Stories, emotions

35:33.218 --> 35:36.830
compelled you
to do exactly what I wanted.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.184
I don't know if it's
because you're part Vulcan,

35:43.228 --> 35:45.012
part human or both.

35:45.055 --> 35:48.494
When you figure out who you are,
maybe you could fill me in.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.974
I must point out the irony

35:51.018 --> 35:53.063
of you questioning my identity.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.978
Oh, come on.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.285
I may have fudged
a detail or two,

35:57.329 --> 35:59.461
but I never lied about who I am.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.507
I lost the man I loved,
even if it was

36:01.550 --> 36:04.031
to a Vulcan prison, not pirates.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.033
You stole a Federation ship

36:06.076 --> 36:09.079
and are blackmailing Vulcans

36:09.123 --> 36:10.646
for love?

36:10.690 --> 36:13.258
My friend,
let me tell you something

36:13.301 --> 36:15.695
that, from those rock-hard eyes
of yours,

36:15.738 --> 36:17.610
I think you know.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.438
Love is the only thing

36:19.481 --> 36:23.050
that makes the cold loneliness
of space bearable.

36:23.093 --> 36:26.140
That's why T'Pring
will make the deal.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.456
-[feedback squeals]
-REMY: Attention.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.936
We are charting a course
for the colony of Qu'Vat.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.417
We have some cargo
to sell to the Klingons.

36:42.461 --> 36:45.159
All crew remain on standby.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.553
You really think
Remy has what it takes

36:47.596 --> 36:49.424
to negotiate with the Klingons?

36:49.468 --> 36:50.904
He can't even make
a decent gruel.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.340
As a medical professional,

36:52.384 --> 36:54.516
I do see signs of malnourishment
in the crew.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.084
Uh, well, he is captain.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.304
I guess they have to do
what he says.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.044
He's not the captain.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.311
All he's saying is
if Remy's willing

37:06.354 --> 37:08.704
to change plans unilaterally,
who else will he turn on

37:08.748 --> 37:10.010
if things go south
with the Klingons?

37:10.053 --> 37:11.925
Whenthings go south.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.797
I can protect myself.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.452
But what about the rest
of the crew?

37:17.496 --> 37:20.194
You are the only person
thinking about them.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.198
That makes you captain material
in my book.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.070
-Remy has friends.
-ORTEGAS: Mm.

37:27.114 --> 37:29.290
I've tasted his cooking.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.858
How many friends
does he really have?

37:31.901 --> 37:34.121
PIKE:
Bet you have friends, too.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.993
And if you needed backup, I...

37:37.037 --> 37:41.650
I might know where you can find
some more friends.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.699
Eat your gruel.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.185
-Alpha Braga IV.
-UNA: Mm.

37:55.229 --> 37:58.014
-Works every time.
-[Una chuckles]

37:58.058 --> 37:59.973
[indistinct chatter]

38:00.016 --> 38:01.322
Look who showed up.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.281
-Open a channel.
-PIRATE: Aye, Captain.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.893
T'Pring, you made
a very logical decision.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.547
Keep Spock alive.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.244
I sympathize
with your predicament.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.855
Now, let's get
those transporters hot

38:12.899 --> 38:15.510
and trade lovers.
[chuckles]

38:15.554 --> 38:18.078
Not that mine cares at all
about logic.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.561
Of course. I believe

38:22.604 --> 38:24.302
I have deduced
who this prisoner is.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.305
This is me waiting.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.611
-Preparing to send the...
-SPOCK: T'Pring, do not do this.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.788
You cannot give them a starship.
You must destroy this vessel.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.137
CHAPEL:
Spock.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.100
You have ten minutes
to hand over Xaverius,

38:40.143 --> 38:42.581
or next time, I set it to kill.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.680
Wait, don't sit up so quickly.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.117
T'PRING:
If I assure
Xaverius's safe transport,

38:57.160 --> 38:58.379
you will not harm Spock?

38:58.423 --> 39:00.250
You have my word.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.296
T'PRING:
Deliver Spock
to the transporter room.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.169
I apologize in advance
for any liberties I take.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.390
-Please follow my lead.
-Okay.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.436
T'PRING:
I will give you the transport
codes for the prisoner's cell.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.481
Wait. T'Pring.

39:13.525 --> 39:16.484
I owe you an apology.
You were right.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.094
Right?

39:18.138 --> 39:19.531
About what?

39:19.574 --> 39:22.229
I have been giving in
to my human side.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.405
More so than I wish to admit.

39:24.449 --> 39:28.061
I cannot deny the emotions
within me any longer.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.063
Spock, you are failing
to communicate effectively.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.156
Nurse Chapel and I...

39:36.199 --> 39:38.550
He's trying to tell you
that we're having an affair.

39:39.551 --> 39:40.726
What?

39:42.292 --> 39:44.817
-We're in love. I'm sorry.
-[Angel laughing]

39:46.471 --> 39:49.430
You're kidding, right?
You expect her

39:49.474 --> 39:50.736
to believe this?

39:50.779 --> 39:52.999
Obviously, it's entirely a ruse

39:53.042 --> 39:55.393
to convince you
not to make the transfer.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.438
No. I...

40:00.789 --> 40:03.401
♪

40:31.037 --> 40:32.821
Oh, you guys are fun.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.823
T'Pring,
feel free to beam over here.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.303
I feel like you could probably

40:36.346 --> 40:38.000
straighten things out
in about a minute.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.568
T'PRING:
In light
of this new information, Spock,

40:40.612 --> 40:42.396
it is only logical
that we terminate

40:42.440 --> 40:43.876
our mating bond.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.791
I understand.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.097
-And I agree.
-Wait, what are you doing?

40:49.098 --> 40:52.624
T'Pring.
Parted from me and never parted.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.887
Never and always touching
and touched.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.498
-I sever what was.
-T'PRING: With these words,
Spock,

40:57.542 --> 41:00.283
you are freed of our bond.

41:00.327 --> 41:03.504
I hold it broken, T'Pring.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.463
-You know
I'm still going to kill him.
-T'PRING: He has made

41:05.506 --> 41:08.030
his choice,
and I have made mine.

41:08.074 --> 41:10.468
[sighs]

41:11.512 --> 41:14.123
Goodbye, Spock.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.995
Goodbye, T'Pring.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.174
Are you kidding me?

41:23.437 --> 41:25.439
Destroy that ship.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.441
Powering up phasers.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.443
[beeping]

41:29.487 --> 41:30.923
Something happened.

41:30.966 --> 41:33.795
-Uh, weapons are immobilized.
-[whirring]

41:33.839 --> 41:37.016
-Shields just went down, too.
-What is going on?

41:43.196 --> 41:45.111
[grunts]

41:45.154 --> 41:47.983
Incoming transmission
from the Serene Squall.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.942
On screen.

41:53.728 --> 41:56.252
I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

41:56.296 --> 41:59.255
Get the hell out of my chair.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.744
UNA:
Our backdoor codes

42:09.788 --> 42:12.225
have successfully paralyzed
weapons and defense systems.

42:13.226 --> 42:15.533
Fire to disable
impulse thrusters.

42:15.576 --> 42:16.664
But gently.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.361
Aye, sir.

42:19.449 --> 42:21.887
PIKE:
Hey. I...

42:22.975 --> 42:24.716
I said gently.

42:24.759 --> 42:27.370
What does firing gently
even mean?

42:28.371 --> 42:30.504
PIRATE:
Impulse power is gone.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.288
We can't get to warp, either.

42:33.246 --> 42:36.118
The logical move
would be to surrender.

42:36.162 --> 42:38.599
I think there's more to life
than logic.

42:40.166 --> 42:41.863
And so, I suspect, do you.

42:45.084 --> 42:48.522
For what it's worth, I did
enjoy meeting you, Mr. Spock.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.178
Xaverius always talked
about you.

42:57.662 --> 43:00.447
I urge you to consider
that you do not need to be

43:00.490 --> 43:02.623
either Vulcan or human.

43:02.667 --> 43:06.758
That is and always has been
a false choice.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.847
The question isn't

43:08.890 --> 43:11.153
what you are.

43:11.197 --> 43:13.460
It's who you are.

43:15.767 --> 43:17.986
See you later.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.104
Did we win? What happened?

43:49.148 --> 43:51.585
Pike to Enterprise.
Everything okay over there?

43:51.629 --> 43:54.588
Yes, Captain.
The pirates have surrendered.

43:54.632 --> 43:57.373
We are preparing to beam
the crew back toEnterprise.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.724
-[indistinct shouting]
-Oh! Uh, before you do,

43:59.767 --> 44:01.508
any chance you could get us
out of here first?

44:01.551 --> 44:03.118
SPOCK:
Sir?

44:03.162 --> 44:05.468
We might have taken over
the bridge a little prematurely.

44:05.512 --> 44:07.427
Our mutiny is still in progress.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.734
Sure would be easier to deal
with this crowd from over there.

44:11.344 --> 44:12.432
Right away, Captain.

44:22.442 --> 44:24.400
PIKE:
Captain's log, supplemental.

44:24.444 --> 44:26.838
Starfleet has taken
theSerene Squall

44:26.881 --> 44:28.883
and its colorful crew
into custody,

44:28.927 --> 44:32.800
although the whereabouts
of Captain Angel remain unknown.

44:35.237 --> 44:37.718
[imitating pirate]:
Argh, me mateys.

44:37.762 --> 44:40.199
If we ever catch Angel,

44:40.242 --> 44:43.681
we should make them
walk the plank. Argh.

44:43.724 --> 44:45.726
Please stop.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.739
[door whooshes open]

45:11.404 --> 45:14.712
-I wasn't sure you would come.
-I was in the vicinity.

45:15.713 --> 45:19.107
I apologize for the...

45:19.151 --> 45:21.675
incident on the bridge
between Nurse Chapel and I.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.764
Why apologize?

45:23.808 --> 45:26.724
It was an impressive gambit
to protect both my reputation

45:26.767 --> 45:27.899
and my patients' safety.

45:27.942 --> 45:30.597
-You knew?
-Of course.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.381
I never actually believed
you could have feelings

45:32.425 --> 45:33.818
for Nurse Chapel.

45:35.820 --> 45:37.343
Of course not.

45:37.386 --> 45:40.259
I assumed it was part
of some greater plan.

45:40.302 --> 45:42.174
And I was right.

45:45.786 --> 45:47.614
I was also right
about something else.

45:47.657 --> 45:49.485
-What?
-Your human side

45:49.529 --> 45:51.574
can be a source of strength.

45:51.618 --> 45:53.751
There is no way
you could have sold the passion

45:53.794 --> 45:55.753
of that kiss without it.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.406
Thank you.

45:58.799 --> 46:00.540
You know me well.

46:12.291 --> 46:14.728
Perhaps we should perform

46:14.772 --> 46:16.948
a rebonding ritual.

46:16.991 --> 46:19.080
That seems logical.

46:43.888 --> 46:45.541
I came here to thank you.

46:47.108 --> 46:50.546
And to applaud your performance
on the bridge.

46:52.070 --> 46:54.202
Yeah, well,

46:54.246 --> 46:57.423
lying isn't your strong suit,
so I just did what I could.

46:58.380 --> 46:59.817
We don't have to talk about it.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.646
I thought,
because you are human,

47:03.690 --> 47:05.648
you might need to discuss
your feelings.

47:05.692 --> 47:07.912
Spock,

47:07.955 --> 47:09.914
like I said earlier,
I like Vulcans.

47:09.957 --> 47:11.611
I know where I stand with you.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.440
You're an honest man.

47:14.483 --> 47:16.703
You're not the guy who would
chase after another woman

47:16.746 --> 47:18.879
while you have a girlfriend.

47:18.923 --> 47:20.446
So...

47:20.489 --> 47:22.883
I know for certain...

47:24.058 --> 47:26.104
...there's no feelings
between us.

47:28.062 --> 47:30.151
I'm glad to hear that.

47:30.195 --> 47:31.892
You know me well.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.373
You're a good friend, Mr. Spock.

47:35.330 --> 47:37.811
As are you, Nurse Chapel.

47:39.944 --> 47:42.381
Spock, one last thing.

47:42.424 --> 47:44.905
You said that on the bridge,

47:44.949 --> 47:47.168
you suddenly realized

47:47.212 --> 47:49.605
the identity of the prisoner
that Angel was trying to free.

47:49.649 --> 47:51.999
Yes.
Things they say were specific

47:52.043 --> 47:54.784
to one Vulcan in particular.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.786
Who?

47:56.830 --> 47:59.093
Ambassador Sarek
had a child out of wedlock.

47:59.137 --> 48:01.052
He, although full Vulcan,

48:01.095 --> 48:03.489
has rejected
the teachings of logic.

48:03.532 --> 48:05.578
-He's one of the V'tosh ka'tur?
-Yes.

48:05.621 --> 48:08.407
CHAPEL:
Isn't Ambassador Sarek

48:08.450 --> 48:10.931
-your father, as well?
-SPOCK: Yes.

48:10.975 --> 48:13.586
I believe Xaverius
to be an assumed name.

48:15.022 --> 48:18.286
I believe the Vulcan
Angel was attempting to free

48:18.330 --> 48:21.333
is someone I was told
to avoid at all costs...

48:23.857 --> 48:25.685
...my half brother, Sybok.
