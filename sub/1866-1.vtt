01:18.080 --> 01:19.279
Hi, Sweetheart.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.581
Hey, Daddy.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.199
You know, you don't have to
pick me up, I can find a ride.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.199
Yeah, I know, that's
what worries me.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.239
What is that on the back
of your hand, Caitlin Maguire?

01:31.240 --> 01:34.039
Relax, Dad, it's henna, okay?

01:34.040 --> 01:37.719
Padma's mom did it for the girls in
class, we're studying Indian culture.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.626
Indian Culture,
it washes-off, right?

01:40.720 --> 01:43.022
Sort of, it will wear off.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.550
I got these, the girl at the store
said they were the best ones.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.279
Jeez, thank you, Dad.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.739
You know, I don't... I don't
take the SAT's until next year.

01:57.740 --> 02:00.666
It's never too early to
start preparing, right?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.019
Oh, hey, can we stop at the
store for a couple of snacks?

02:04.020 --> 02:06.319
The boys are coming over
after Mikey gets off work.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.429
So, Mikey has a job, huh?

02:08.759 --> 02:13.384
Yeah, not everyone at my
school is a rich snob, Dad.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.664
Mikey's on scholarship and
he washes dishes at Denny's.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.870
Have you finished
with your term paper?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.304
- Totally.
- Totally.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.999
All right, it's almost done, I just
have to proof it and print it.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.279
I want that paper done before your
two little buddies come over,

02:31.280 --> 02:32.945
otherwise you'll never finish.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.910
Alea est iacta.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.749
What?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.744
The die is cast.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.702
It's from "Julius Caesar", you know that thing
I've been working on for the past six weeks.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.984
The die is cast.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.150
It's impressive.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.031
You got the date locked?

02:55.680 --> 02:57.119
Next Saturday,

02:57.120 --> 02:59.239
Caitlin's gonna love it,
the band's booked.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.499
- She's got the whole place to herself.
- Good.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.759
Caitlin's Sweet Sixteen,
damn, makes me feel old!

03:05.760 --> 03:08.359
What are we gonna
do with the... those?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.599
Don't worry about it,

03:09.600 --> 03:12.599
I'll tell the bartenders
and waitresses, "No booze".

03:12.600 --> 03:13.521
Not a drop,

03:13.522 --> 03:14.599
Oh, okay.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.029
Did you talk to the doorman,
"no meth at the door"?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.666
- Your doormen sell meth?
- Don't worry about it.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.999
If I hear of anyone even
looking at Caitlin's friends funny,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.679
I'll kick their asses myself.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.779
No, no, no, wait a minute,

03:28.780 --> 03:32.159
these are sixteen year-old kids.
Kane, I don't want any incidents.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.359
We're not sixteen year-olds,
drinking and doing drugs,

03:35.360 --> 03:37.150
like we're role models.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.139
How much trouble did we used to
get into when we were their age?

03:40.140 --> 03:42.679
You know, I seem to remember
you double-dipping Betsy,

03:42.680 --> 03:44.119
the one with those wavy eyes.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.212
That's right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

03:47.213 --> 03:49.179
Wasn't she your girl for a while?

03:49.180 --> 03:53.999
She was for a while until I found-out that
this bad-ass was knocking his bot dong around.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.919
Well, hey, we shared the
same honey-pot, right?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.599
- It makes us milk-brothers.
- Romulus and Remus.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.759
Well, this is what I
don't understand,

04:01.760 --> 04:03.779
how would you remember who you bang,

04:03.780 --> 04:07.079
I mean, you've been drinking a fifth
of Scotch a day since you were born?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.701
About a bad-ass,
mean-ass man you was.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.265
I'm gonna throw a great party,
you're a great dad.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.186
I gotta run.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.070
Take it easy, Paulie.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.988
Oh, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!

04:25.480 --> 04:28.959
Can you please tell us how many jobs
will be provided on this project?

04:28.960 --> 04:33.119
Yes... Phase One has already
created more than a hundred jobs,

04:33.120 --> 04:34.959
local jobs, for this community.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.279
And today we begin Phase Two.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.639
And Phase Two means
that we'll have a park,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.359
- as well as a river-walk.
- Mr. Maguire!

04:43.360 --> 04:45.359
What do you intend to
do with the profits?

04:45.360 --> 04:46.479
Thank you, Frank.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.879
The Mayor and I feel
that this project will

04:48.880 --> 04:51.379
certainly stimulate the economy and

04:51.380 --> 04:55.541
we intend to put the money back into
education and medical, thank you.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.071
Thank you all for coming.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.094
Hey, are you almost ready? We're gonna be late
for dinner with the Thompsons and Dean White.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.668
What does Dean White do exactly?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.639
He works for the governor.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.839
I think he's gonna run
for State Controller.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.959
Good guy to know.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.109
We're gonna need a
few extra contacts.

05:24.135 --> 05:26.888
Do you prefer the Noir
tonight, or the Portofino?

05:27.040 --> 05:27.989
Noir.

05:28.500 --> 05:33.064
You know Princeton's nearly 40,000 a year
and that's not including room and board?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.839
I know, can we swing it?

05:35.840 --> 05:37.266
I got it covered.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.279
We've got it covered.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.799
We're a team here, right?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.599
Yes, we are a team, but...

05:43.600 --> 05:47.621
No, no buts! None of this "She's
my daughter" bullshit, all right?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.667
I love the two of you, and I'm here
for you both, you got it?

05:51.320 --> 05:55.039
You know, you're very sexy
when you put me in my place.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.229
Is this you changing the subject?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.462
I don't think we have time for this.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.982
You are SUCH a tease.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.422
I'm not gonna shit on no hellion.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.147
Caitlin, your gonna be
staying home tonight, right?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.599
Yeah, we just hanging-out here.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.719
Good, because you have a lot of homework
that needs to be done by Monday,

06:25.720 --> 06:28.000
- and you need to focus on your work.
- Okay, Dad.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.148
I'm serious.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.039
Dad, I know. Listen, we're
just gonna hang-out here,

06:33.040 --> 06:34.719
watch TV or something.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.102
Lisa might stop by, but that is it.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.670
Michael, I hear you're a working man.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.061
- Yes, sir.
- And how's that working out for you?

06:44.640 --> 06:45.639
It sucks.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.659
But it's nice for a buck or two,
and it's pretty flexible, you know?

06:48.660 --> 06:51.239
This summer if you wanna make
some real money, you let me know,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.239
I can put you on one of my crews.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.539
Swinging a hammer pays a hell of a
lot more than working at Denny's.

06:56.540 --> 06:57.492
You'd do that for me?

06:57.493 --> 07:00.545
Yeah, if you give me a hand with
one of these boxes over here.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.782
Okay.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.906
- This?
- Yeah.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.942
So, you gonna ask my daughter out?

07:12.840 --> 07:13.823
What?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.148
I see the way you're lookin' at her.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.388
I didn't think you'd
let her go out, you know?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.742
- You smoke weed?
- No.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.461
- No drugs at all?
- No.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.679
Well, then, I... I might....

07:29.680 --> 07:32.790
be willing to make an exception.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.342
Do you think she'd say, "Yes"?

07:36.160 --> 07:38.719
The mind of a woman is
a mysterious thing.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.399
I can't tell you
what she'll say, but...

07:41.400 --> 07:44.067
"Fortune favors the bold."

07:45.800 --> 07:47.261
You ready?

07:48.160 --> 07:51.589
Yeah, I'm almost there, go start
the car, I'll be right there,

07:54.960 --> 07:56.419
Caitlin, I 'm not your mother,

07:56.420 --> 07:58.959
I'm not going to lecture
you about smoking,

07:58.960 --> 08:00.439
although you shouldn't be smoking,

08:00.440 --> 08:03.319
but the last time you and
your friends hung-out,

08:03.320 --> 08:05.719
Paul found cigarette
butts in the back yard

08:05.720 --> 08:08.759
- and I took the heat for it.
- He believe you?

08:08.760 --> 08:12.239
Probably not, but
that's not the point.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.987
- The look he gave me...
- I know the look.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.759
- So, you understand?
- Yeah.

08:18.760 --> 08:23.588
Yeah, Vanessa, I'll
be good, I promise.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.351
Thank you.
You guys have a good night.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.066
She's so hot.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.022
Dickhead!

08:46.200 --> 08:49.039
I think the dock area is the
perfect place to build,

08:49.040 --> 08:51.319
that part of town is just
screaming for re-development.

08:51.320 --> 08:56.230
Uh-huh, I heard you got a lot
going on in re-development.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.759
How'd you get started in
the business, Mr. Maguire?

08:58.760 --> 09:02.701
Oh, it's getting late, it's
already past midnight.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.419
I'm sure everybody'd like
to go home and get some rest.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.679
Paul doesn't like to brag,

09:07.680 --> 09:11.063
but the truth of the matter is he
built his first development himself.

09:11.440 --> 09:14.279
- A lot of hard work.
- That's what I've heard.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.839
Well, I had a full crew
with me, but yeah...

09:16.840 --> 09:19.653
my first job was swinging a hammer,

09:20.079 --> 09:22.779
tends to drive my
foremen all crazy, but,

09:22.780 --> 09:27.039
there's nothing that satisfies like a...
an honest day's work.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.422
Love a guy that's not afraid to roll his
sleeves up and get his hands dirty.

09:30.423 --> 09:32.307
Here's to an honest day's work!

09:33.720 --> 09:35.545
To an honest day's work!

09:35.880 --> 09:38.581
They're coming to get you, Barbara!

09:39.520 --> 09:40.582
Stop it!

09:41.040 --> 09:43.991
Hey, my dad kinda likes you.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.439
It's funny.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.239
Yeah, Mike go work for The Big Guy,
get in with the family,

09:50.240 --> 09:52.719
next thing ya know,
you're marryin' Caitlin,

09:52.720 --> 09:56.024
takin' over the business,
you'll be a made man in no time.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.705
Cut it out, man!

10:18.720 --> 10:21.239
Detective, you here for dinner?

10:21.240 --> 10:23.999
- Paul, we need to talk.
- What seems to be the problem?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.679
- I'm sorry, but it's urgent.
- This is not the time or the place.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.719
Whatever this is, surely we can
discuss it in the morning.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.439
Paul, listen to me,
this is not about you.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.026
It's about Caitlin.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.839
They called it in about an hour ago,

10:46.840 --> 10:48.919
Michael and that other boy, Evan,

10:48.920 --> 10:51.679
they sent him to the hospital
and got him a sedative.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.879
He was really shaken-up.
What this Michael kid told us

10:54.880 --> 10:58.399
was that all three of them
were together when it happened.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.217
They were playing video games,
had a few drinks.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.359
He said that Caitlin
tried to get away.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.759
They say that she put
up a helluva fight.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.585
This can't be happening.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.659
Wha... wha... what about the
neighbors, did they see anything?

12:21.660 --> 12:22.879
No, nothing.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.559
I mean, who would break
into your house, grab your daughter,

12:25.560 --> 12:27.739
there's no ransom demands, nothing.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.919
I don't know, I don't have a problem
with anyone right now.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.959
Right now, but think
about your past.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.879
Who would have the
inclination to do this?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.839
I know you still talk to O'Connell.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.710
This is my daughter!

12:39.960 --> 12:43.469
I would tell you if I had
any idea who was behind this.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.399
Would you?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.559
Pete, I 'm out of the
game, you know that!

12:46.560 --> 12:49.799
- How long have we known each other?
- Since the massacre at the Four P's...

12:49.800 --> 12:52.799
- Yes, fifteen years, Pete.
- Yeah, I know you.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.399
Right! You do, you know me.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.759
I just don't want you fallin' back
on any of the old habits.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.359
Let us handle this our way,
all right, Paul?

13:00.360 --> 13:03.545
Okay, fine, what's your way?

13:03.840 --> 13:05.559
Well, we drop it on
the News right away.

13:05.560 --> 13:09.639
Within, if it sits on your history.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.341
How many times do we
have to tell you, that he's clean?

13:12.360 --> 13:14.639
One of two things
is going-down here,

13:14.640 --> 13:16.659
the kidnappers either
know you or they don't.

13:16.660 --> 13:20.539
If they don't, then the fear of who
they're messin' with is our best asset.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.827
Once they hear, they'll probably drop
her off at a gas station somewhere

13:23.828 --> 13:26.387
and she's back by lunch tomorrow.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.820
And if they know me?

13:28.880 --> 13:32.707
They'll be in contact,
and we'll be there.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.879
We have a top on your phone.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.868
Either myself or Detective
Hansen will be here at all times.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.902
Paul, we'll find her.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.981
You better.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.261
Why, Paul?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.386
Why Caitlin?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.224
- You didn't...?
- You, too?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.382
I'm sorry.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.199
- I just...
- If I had any idea

14:09.200 --> 14:11.261
who did this...

14:12.560 --> 14:14.828
just one...

14:16.680 --> 14:18.311
You find her.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.025
Do what you have to do.

14:22.400 --> 14:27.547
Whatever it takes,
you just bring her home.

14:36.360 --> 14:40.319
Two unidentified male classmates
were injured in that home invasion

14:40.320 --> 14:42.679
they're expected to
make a full recovery.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.679
Caitlin Maguire is five-six,
one hundred and five pounds,

14:45.680 --> 14:48.079
with long brown hair and blue eyes.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.339
If you have any information that
could help in the investigation

14:50.340 --> 14:54.703
and search for Caitlin...

15:42.700 --> 15:44.745
Move! Let's go!

15:44.960 --> 15:47.069
Go, go, Danny, go!

15:57.540 --> 16:00.079
- I'm gonna go out.
- Go out?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.499
I can't just sit here,

16:01.500 --> 16:05.159
waiting for the phone to ring, knowing
she's out there somewhere, scared.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.679
And I'm supposed to
stay here all by myself?

16:07.680 --> 16:09.919
There's cops all over the house.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.745
That's not what I meant.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.028
Please.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.631
Be safe, okay?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.500
Where are we off to?

16:28.600 --> 16:29.549
Hey!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.059
It'd be best if you just
stay here by the phone.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.237
Shouldn't you be out somewhere
looking for my daughter?

16:34.380 --> 16:37.347
- We're doin' everything we can.
- So am I.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.149
Paul!

16:55.000 --> 16:56.586
I'm so sorry,

16:57.400 --> 17:01.750
Eleanor, please, I need
to speak with your son.

17:08.599 --> 17:09.502
Wow!

17:10.540 --> 17:12.710
You got all these awards.

17:16.240 --> 17:20.439
You know, I started dating
Mary when I was seventeen.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.146
That was Caitlin's mom, Mary.
Your seventeen, right?

17:24.548 --> 17:25.763
Yeah.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.704
I remember once we were
on this date down by the shore...

17:30.640 --> 17:32.465
summertime,

17:32.880 --> 17:37.071
hot as shit, just wouldn't cool off.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.999
Anyway, this Puerto Rican looking shithead
comes walking down the beach, and

17:42.000 --> 17:44.143
calls Mary a slut.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.946
You believe that shit?

17:48.280 --> 17:52.944
Calling a nice, Irish, Catholic girl
like that a slut, well...

17:53.160 --> 17:55.439
needless to say, I had
to defend her honor,

17:55.440 --> 17:59.583
because that's what gentlemen do,
they protect women.

18:00.520 --> 18:05.938
So I went and I got the tire iron out of the
trunk of my car and I broke both of his legs.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.103
I'm not like that anymore.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.789
No, I've changed,

18:15.720 --> 18:19.103
See, 'cause when Mary got sick...

18:20.920 --> 18:23.382
stage four breast cancer...

18:23.940 --> 18:27.254
swore I'd go legit, so there'd
always be at least one...

18:27.255 --> 18:30.869
one parent around to
take care of Caitlin.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.079
They each had guns!

18:33.080 --> 18:38.261
I would expect you to get SHOT...
trying to protect her.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.508
Now, I want you to think hard,

18:43.240 --> 18:44.985
what did they sound like?

18:45.840 --> 18:46.823
What?

18:47.120 --> 18:50.071
The kidnappers,
did they have an accent?

18:51.920 --> 18:53.904
Did they sound Russian?

18:54.240 --> 18:55.871
Puerto Rican?

18:55.880 --> 18:59.184
Did they use any words? Slang?
Did they sound like greenbahs?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.399
I... I don't know.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.750
Wha... what did they smell like?
Spicy food, too much cologne?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.439
Come on, Mike,
you have to give me something.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.779
If anything happens to my daughter,

19:09.780 --> 19:14.990
- I'm holding you personally responsible.
- I don't know, I'm sorry, I don't know!

19:17.400 --> 19:20.510
It was all so fast, I
messed up, ya know.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.025
I wish I coulda done something,
I wish I'd been braver.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.548
I wish it was me, okay?

19:32.800 --> 19:37.185
If you remember anything,
you give me a call, you got it?

19:37.600 --> 19:39.140
Yes, sir.

19:52.520 --> 19:57.064
Yeah, it's me, I need some help, will
you meet me at the construction site?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.105
We're sorry,

20:15.260 --> 20:18.227
We'll find this roach
who did this, Paulie.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.470
You got my word on it.

20:23.440 --> 20:27.347
I know you're still in
with O'Connell, right?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.021
- Yep.
- Right.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.902
You remember that stink that
Golden syphed not too long ago?

20:34.480 --> 20:38.546
Did my time, kept my mouth
shut, roughed me up.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.308
I need guys I can trust.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.239
The cops are keeping
very close tabs on me, so...

20:46.240 --> 20:50.545
I... I understand if you don't want
to get involved with this, but I...

20:52.960 --> 20:55.991
I do need some help.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.951
Say the word.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.706
I want to find her.

21:04.680 --> 21:10.191
- I want to find who took her, and...
- They're dead, Paulie.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.907
They just don't know it yet, right?

21:13.920 --> 21:15.759
There's two hundred thousand.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.906
Use what you need to get any
information, just keep the rest, okay?

21:21.720 --> 21:23.545
We really can't take that.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.706
We're family.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.587
You'd do the same
thing for us, Paulie.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.827
- We'll do anything you ask.
- I know.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.226
This could get dirty, so, just
how deep do you want this to go?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.705
How deep is hell?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.830
I know just where to look.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.719
The guy's a rat but he knows me.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.785
Just hang back and follow
my lead, all right?

22:02.880 --> 22:05.626
Jesus, an elevator woulda been nice.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.190
Knock, knock, asshole!

22:10.840 --> 22:12.525
Oh, shit!

22:13.680 --> 22:16.399
No, no, no, no!
I didn't steal anything, man!

22:16.400 --> 22:18.939
I swear! You know I wouldn't
mess with you guys! C'mon!

22:18.940 --> 22:23.192
Relax, relax, I know you wouldn't do that,
all right, you're too smart for that.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.159
I got one question to
ask you, all right?

22:26.160 --> 22:28.542
Who kidnapped Paul
Maguire's daughter?

22:29.240 --> 22:32.571
Take a good look,
you heard anything?

22:33.200 --> 22:35.839
Nothing! I swear!
If I knew, I would tell you! C’mon!

22:35.840 --> 22:37.949
Now, who would mess
with Maguire anyway?

22:49.440 --> 22:51.822
My, my, my.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.100
I'm not happy with what
I see here, Oliver.

22:59.880 --> 23:05.061
I'll bet you were a sweet little BL,
huh, before he got you all jacked-up?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.540
Come here, honey, come here honey.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.030
That's it, easy now.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.719
Put her down, put her down.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.419
- What are you doing?
- Come on, my Little Princess.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.231
Am I your Little Princess?

23:19.560 --> 23:23.239
I got a pretty little
Princess Necklace here for you, too.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.759
You don't know anything about
the girl, huh, Oliver?

23:25.760 --> 23:28.919
- Nothing, I swear!
- Start talking, Oliver!

23:28.920 --> 23:35.119
Please! Please! Look! Whatever it is you
about to do... don't, please, don't, no.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.039
Tell me about the girl, Oliver.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.708
Please, if I knew, I would tell you.
C'mon, don't hurt her, c'mon, man.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.144
Please don't, don't.
No, no! Don't Doherty!

23:44.800 --> 23:46.261
Listen to me,

23:47.560 --> 23:50.279
If there a girl being
held somewhere?

23:50.280 --> 23:54.187
I don't know, I don't know! No idea!
Just tell him! I don't know!

24:00.400 --> 24:03.180
- No, no, no, no!
- Talk to me, Oliver!

24:04.600 --> 24:06.709
No, please! Don't!

24:08.680 --> 24:11.711
- I love her, no, I don't know!
- What's that?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.625
I love her, man!

24:17.240 --> 24:21.319
No, no, no, no! Lisa, come here.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.479
I need you to breathe.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.863
Now I believe you.
See you around, Oliver

24:26.440 --> 24:28.799
Jesus, I can't believe
I hit that rope.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.599
What, you've never
done that shit before?

24:30.600 --> 24:33.919
Hell no, I thought she was going
for a two-story swan dive.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.588
- You're one harmful guy.
- Right, right, you're a saint, huh?

24:39.120 --> 24:43.186
- Nobody's seen or heard anything.
- How is that possible?

24:43.320 --> 24:46.199
Paul, we've been rattling
jaws all night long.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.559
Whoever took her, is
keeping their shit tight.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.664
Got feelers out everywhere.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.221
Somewhere, someone...
has to mess-up.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.828
Right.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.822
Paul,

25:57.520 --> 25:59.185
We found her.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.061
Thank you for your beautiful soul.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.580
I'm sorry.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.119
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you for coming,

28:33.120 --> 28:35.343
I'm so sorry, my friend,

28:35.600 --> 28:38.119
- Vanessa, this is Francis...
- Francis O'Connell.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.229
Hi, I 'm Vanessa, I'm Paul's wife.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.676
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Frank.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.519
If you don't mind,
Frank, I have a...

28:46.520 --> 28:48.902
some things I'd like to
attend to at the house.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.385
I'll see you later.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.544
Can we take a walk?

28:59.920 --> 29:03.064
You've done really good
for yourself, Paulie.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.185
I 'm proud of you.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.028
Smoke and mirrors, Francis.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.344
That's not what I heard.

29:12.800 --> 29:16.229
You got a nice, big house over
there by the Country Club, eh?

29:17.160 --> 29:19.349
And a beautiful wife.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.628
You know, Paul, the
present situation aside,

29:26.400 --> 29:30.700
you got yourself one helluva life,
don't you agree? Huh?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.710
Is this going somewhere?

29:33.120 --> 29:35.339
Things have settled down,

29:35.340 --> 29:38.519
and the business is more civilized
than it used to be.

29:38.520 --> 29:43.303
In the good old days, you remember,
the gutters were running red. Huh?

29:44.040 --> 29:47.469
You remember that
night at the Four Ps,

29:48.080 --> 29:50.986
and what those Russians
faggots did to me?

29:51.520 --> 29:52.787
Of course.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.299
But do you remember what I told you

29:56.300 --> 30:00.661
because you wanted to
rush-in and kill 'em all?

30:01.400 --> 30:06.183
- You said we lost too many already.
- Exactly.

30:07.520 --> 30:11.222
I don't know what this
has to do with anything.

30:13.400 --> 30:18.439
My neck, it's hurtin' to
look up to you like this.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.822
Do you mind sitting down?

30:25.880 --> 30:29.423
That's better. Eye to eye.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.183
That's the thing I miss
the most, I guess,

30:34.240 --> 30:38.670
to be able to stand over
somebody and stare 'em down.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.345
Those simple, small things in life
that I'm not able to do anymore.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.819
You know, like bangin'
a young broad, or

30:52.820 --> 30:56.661
kicking somebody's teeth
down their throat.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.791
But do I lash out, Paulie?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.866
Do I show my weakness? No.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.790
I bury it a long time ago.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.029
I buried the hurt.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.507
Just like you have to bury yours.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.786
Hey, I'm not finished! Sit down!

31:22.320 --> 31:23.559
Um-huh.

31:23.560 --> 31:27.143
Yeah, you better be listening.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.150
Because I know you,

31:29.280 --> 31:33.199
and know this unpleasantness
is eating at you,

31:33.200 --> 31:36.439
and you're determined to
do something about it.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.141
I'm asking you, don't.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.751
Let the cops do their jobs, huh?

31:44.160 --> 31:47.907
Things are good,
I want 'em to stay that way.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.428
Right?

31:49.880 --> 31:53.707
Things don't look so good
from where I am, Francis.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.702
If you won't listen to reason,
can you listen to a friend.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.319
I did you a big favor
when I let you walk out.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.510
I didn't have to,
you know that, but I did.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.079
I let you walk out.

32:10.080 --> 32:15.639
It's not every day someone can just walk
out of the business, clean, as you could.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.907
But you could, you know why?

32:20.680 --> 32:23.426
Because you came to
me and you asked me.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.719
I did you a favor and now I want

32:27.720 --> 32:31.667
you to repay me by doing nothing.

32:32.400 --> 32:37.661
Let it go away, Paulie,
bury the hurt.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.231
You understand me.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.423
Yeah.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.231
I understand.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.239
Does anyone want cream?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.304
No thanks, I'm good.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.822
Your friend Sheila
still come around?

33:20.320 --> 33:23.271
I don't know what we're
gonna do with all the food.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.508
So...

33:30.160 --> 33:32.030
Honey, do you mind?

33:33.480 --> 33:35.020
I want to know.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.902
No, really, you don't.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.343
Hey.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.319
- She's a peach, that wife of yours.
- So, what's the word?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.507
No word.

33:57.520 --> 34:02.064
O'Connell not only said to stay out of
it, but to keep an eye on you, too.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.226
So what now?

34:08.239 --> 34:12.386
I still have someone inside the Force,
someone who won't report back to your boss.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.668
I do.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.581
I can have him check into the case.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.545
I didn't want to bring
this up, because...

34:25.320 --> 34:26.893
we're not supposed to
bring it up, we...

34:27.040 --> 34:30.984
No, it was a long time ago,
we did everything right.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.906
Are you sure?

34:38.360 --> 34:40.927
- Go, go, Danny, go!
- Go, go!

34:43.480 --> 34:45.659
- Where is the key?
- Where is it?

34:45.659 --> 34:48.359
- I ain't got it.!
- Where is it, asshole?

34:48.360 --> 34:50.742
- No! No! No!
- Give me his gun.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.460
Shit, no, no, no, no!

34:57.400 --> 35:00.021
It's your nasty, clean it up!

35:42.840 --> 35:45.541
No, we... we did everything right.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.821
Jesus!

36:05.240 --> 36:07.269
Tell me about it.

36:08.240 --> 36:12.306
How is it that a man with this
many past criminal associations

36:12.320 --> 36:17.421
can turn legitimate businessman and I
can't get a re-file on my mortgage?

36:18.120 --> 36:21.959
I mean, look at this!
Irish mob, Russian mob.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.627
Twenty suspects, no leads.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.079
When have you ever known
a criminal to just go clean?

36:28.080 --> 36:30.621
No arrest doesn't mean no activity.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.719
Maybe he's just been careful.

36:32.720 --> 36:37.070
No, I just talked with him
a few days ago, he's a wreck.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.942
If he was still dirty,
he'd know who did this.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.627
This ought to narrow-down
the suspect list.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.099
It's the ballistics
on the Maguire girl.

36:47.100 --> 36:52.301
A 7.62 millimeter, fired from
a Soviet made Tokarev TT-33.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.479
Well, it gets worse.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.670
It crossed against three hits
tied to the Chernov family.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.024
One in 1983, and two in 1988.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.999
What does that tell you?

37:03.000 --> 37:07.271
That whoever killed her,

37:08.154 --> 37:12.540
hadn't killed anyone
for a long, damn time.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.868
At least not with that gun.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.868
This stays here.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.941
Mr. Maguire.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.391
I'm really very sorry for your loss.

38:22.640 --> 38:27.787
Caitlin was... she was
really something else.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.186
Yes, she was.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.159
She worked really hard on that,
and I just thought that...

38:40.160 --> 38:42.940
Of course, I'll read it tonight.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.421
Mr. Maguire,

38:49.440 --> 38:52.664
Would you like to collect Caitlin's
belongings from her locker?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.959
Are you sure it's Chernov?

39:34.960 --> 39:36.705
No, I'm not sure.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.519
But whoever did it
used a Russian gun.

39:39.520 --> 39:42.630
It was 20 years ago,
how could they know about us?

39:42.840 --> 39:43.868
How?

39:45.360 --> 39:48.470
They took his daughter,
and you think that's coincidence.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.465
Yeah, well, I never talked.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.665
And you never talked.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.867
And I'm certain Paul never talked.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.989
So, how would anybody know?

40:05.240 --> 40:07.429
This whole mess just stinks,

40:09.760 --> 40:11.550
Do you want me to tell him?

40:13.480 --> 40:15.111
No, I'll tell him.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.831
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.861
Is he in?

40:23.120 --> 40:24.945
Maybe he'll talk to you.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.706
Are you okay?

40:30.800 --> 40:31.749
Fine.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.311
I know it's hard.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.199
Just because she wasn't my blood,

40:38.200 --> 40:41.424
doesn't mean she wasn't
my daughter, you know.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.861
She loved you,

40:45.520 --> 40:46.582
Thank you.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.541
Stay strong.

40:52.480 --> 40:53.906
He's upstairs.

41:00.080 --> 41:00.983
Hey.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.265
It was when she was four.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.750
What have you heard?

41:10.920 --> 41:13.348
- Ballistics.
- Yes?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.185
Wanna get out of here?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.062
So, what does that mean exactly?

41:19.280 --> 41:24.295
How's someone like you get as far in your
organization without knowing his guns?

41:24.520 --> 41:27.119
Knives are quiet, I like knives.

41:27.120 --> 41:30.071
Tokarev. TT-33.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.905
It's an old army sidearm, HL clip.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.613
And it's favored in
the Russian mafia.

41:40.114 --> 41:42.032
Jesus.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.544
Yeah, the Russians.
Coulda been a hit.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.279
It coulda been a smaller faction
just lookin' for some ransom money.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.670
Not one of 'em takes a shit
without Chernov's permission.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.679
We never asked permission
to rob the Russians.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.505
We don't talk about that.

42:02.720 --> 42:07.579
I keep trying to get Vanessa to stay
someplace safe, but she won't listen.

42:07.580 --> 42:11.186
- She won't go.
- So, what do you wanna do?

42:13.920 --> 42:15.301
Call Danny.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.828
Like old times, fellas.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.511
Let's do this, huh?

42:47.120 --> 42:48.299
You're not understanding,

42:48.300 --> 42:52.519
as we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.

42:52.520 --> 42:56.063
Clearly you have a problem understanding
English, we want to play cards.

42:56.064 --> 42:59.119
- We want to play cards.
- Nyet! Private!

42:59.120 --> 43:01.519
No, no, that is NOT what I said,
what I said is

43:01.520 --> 43:05.063
we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.186
Okay, let us in.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.383
Private.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.559
Rivet?

43:10.560 --> 43:13.784
Hey, hey, hey!
We need you to move, pardner!

43:22.040 --> 43:23.944
Speak English!

43:25.320 --> 43:27.861
I speak three languages.

43:30.080 --> 43:34.271
How many you speak?
Stupid Americans?

44:32.160 --> 44:34.189
That got their attention.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.064
- They're gonna come gunnin' for us.
- No shit!

44:40.200 --> 44:44.027
Always the best way to get information
when it's hard to come by.

44:44.280 --> 44:47.679
You stir the pot,
they'll come lookin' for you.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.665
- Just be ready.
- We're ready.

44:51.680 --> 44:55.946
Now, Danny, this shit's about to get
radical, you gotta cover each other.

44:56.800 --> 45:00.439
- Relax! All right, we got this.
- Not one of your cocaine parties.

45:00.440 --> 45:03.471
Really? You gotta go there, Paulie?

45:04.760 --> 45:07.381
What is it with you and
my partying anyway, huh?

45:08.360 --> 45:10.919
All right, let's just relax, okay?

45:10.920 --> 45:11.903
All right?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.386
Jesus, Paulie.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.239
- What is this?
- You know exactly what this is.

45:23.240 --> 45:26.559
It is not safe for you
to be here anymore.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.839
Tell me what happened?

45:27.840 --> 45:30.799
Please don't shut me out,
I want to know.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.042
What? What would you
really want to know? Huh?

45:34.240 --> 45:35.785
What do you want to know? You
want to know how many people

45:35.786 --> 45:38.431
I jacked-up last night,
how loud the screams were?

45:38.680 --> 45:40.584
- No, I...
- Then what!?

45:42.360 --> 45:43.786
Is it over?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.904
It 's just beginning,

45:50.080 --> 45:53.519
What do you think?
I need you, you need me.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.419
You told me to do
whatever it takes, right?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.779
Well, this is what it takes,
pack your bags.

45:57.780 --> 46:00.719
Nothing was wrong, maybe I should've
kept my mouth shut.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.159
But you didn't.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.079
Now I'm in this.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.303
I'm sorry if it upsets you.

46:07.240 --> 46:10.385
Yeah, that upsets me.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.829
My husband is a killer.

46:16.520 --> 46:20.383
I think you're enjoying this.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.839
Say, "My husband's a killer."

46:22.840 --> 46:25.819
Come on, repeat after me,
"My husband is a killer."

46:25.820 --> 46:29.479
You've always known it,
you just haven't seen it until now.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.989
Huh? Is that what's going on? Is that why
you're still here? 'Cause it turns you on?

47:12.800 --> 47:14.704
- Anything?
- Nothin'.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.821
All right, we up the stakes.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.145
What are you thinkin'?

47:21.520 --> 47:23.345
We need a vory.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.584
Let me make a quick call.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.547
Beautiful.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.879
Yeah, just take him into the back room,
keep him occupied for us, sweetheart.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.341
We'll be right over.

47:45.320 --> 47:47.748
Yeah, me too, easy now.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.699
Amber's got a vory over at the Club,

47:49.700 --> 47:52.302
she's gonna take him to
the back room for us.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.222
Just in case the bot can.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.918
All right, all three of us go in here,
it's gonna look suspicious as hell.

48:01.919 --> 48:05.343
All right, so, you two sit tight,
and I'll go in and get this prick out.

48:06.160 --> 48:07.700
I got this.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.868
I shoot people in the street.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.306
Do you know who I am?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.342
- What? You are nothing to me.
- Hey!

51:05.890 --> 51:08.199
Do you know me? Huh?

51:08.200 --> 51:11.319
Nineteen years ago I
threw you from a car,

51:11.320 --> 51:14.385
and stole your boss' money,
do you remember that?

51:15.500 --> 51:17.261
In the mask.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.981
Chernov thought I took the money.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.071
He tortured me, you're too late.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.425
I lost these fingers because of you.

51:29.080 --> 51:33.669
Someone put a bullet
in my daughter's head,

51:34.160 --> 51:36.383
with a Russian handgun.

51:38.840 --> 51:40.426
Who did it?

51:41.200 --> 51:43.025
Was that Chernov?

51:44.120 --> 51:46.900
Someone had to have a turn?
Who was it?

51:48.640 --> 51:49.702
Who did it?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.279
Who did it?

51:52.280 --> 51:57.791
No, no, no, no! Don't die.
No, no! Don't die!

51:58.200 --> 52:01.059
Who did it? Who did it? Who did it?

52:01.280 --> 52:06.507
Who did it? Who did it?
Who did it? Who did it?

53:04.120 --> 53:05.990
A cup of coffee, please.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.982
Thank you.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.828
I 'm here, what do you want?

53:17.520 --> 53:21.586
You can't go around tearing-up the
city, this isn't good for anyone.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.789
Don't know what you're talkin' about.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.505
Look, man,

53:28.014 --> 53:29.980
this isn't gonna bring your kid back.

53:31.200 --> 53:34.026
I feel you, what
you're goin' through.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.279
But if this keeps up,

53:36.280 --> 53:41.142
I promise you I'm gonna find a way to
put you and your crew away for good.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.029
Shit, Paul!

53:48.200 --> 53:51.359
A few years ago, my kid, Robbie,

53:51.360 --> 53:55.426
was ridin' his bike on 6th Street,
got hit by a car.

53:55.800 --> 53:59.300
I get to emergency and
it's touch and go.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.429
Yeah.

54:03.680 --> 54:07.063
The poor kid is.. is in surgery.

54:08.200 --> 54:12.264
I felt I needed to do
something, anything.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.662
Found out where the guy lived.

54:16.800 --> 54:21.708
I see his fender, mangled,

54:23.480 --> 54:25.544
where he hit my boy.

54:26.120 --> 54:32.029
I must've stood an hour
at the edge of that driveway,

54:33.240 --> 54:35.190
with the gun in my hand.

54:36.240 --> 54:40.631
Then, finally I cooled myself down
and I go back to the hospital,

54:41.520 --> 54:43.788
Robbie pulls through.

54:44.400 --> 54:47.095
A few days later, I went
down to 6th Street,

54:47.320 --> 54:49.384
there was construction going on,

54:49.960 --> 54:51.625
there was a blind spot.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.746
And I realized, in that moment,

54:56.240 --> 54:59.146
that that accident coulda
happened to anyone.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.948
If I had killed that man,

55:03.320 --> 55:05.463
it wouldn't've changed a thing.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.625
Your kid is still alive.

55:12.920 --> 55:14.506
Anything else?

56:04.040 --> 56:06.024
C'mon, bitch!

56:38.080 --> 56:38.759
You!

56:38.760 --> 56:41.239
Put you weapon down,
on the floor now!

56:41.240 --> 56:42.348
Down!

56:42.640 --> 56:43.668
All right!

57:48.760 --> 57:50.391
Andrei!

57:53.480 --> 57:55.191
Andrei!

57:58.440 --> 58:00.071
Andrei!

59:06.760 --> 59:09.619
It's okay, you'll be dead soon.

59:10.320 --> 59:11.746
But first...

59:15.200 --> 59:16.831
you're gonna talk.

59:30.720 --> 59:34.079
Somebody put one helluva dent
in Chernov's drug operation.

59:34.080 --> 59:38.799
Yeah, and I haven't even started thinkin'
about the mess at the Russian joint.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.379
Six skull cross, Chernov's men, huh?

59:41.380 --> 59:43.982
Meet Sasha Barad.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.349
Rap sheet as long as my dick.

59:46.920 --> 59:48.359
Cutting-off fingers.

59:48.360 --> 59:50.679
Somebody's trying to
sniff-out a secret.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.028
I have a pretty good idea who.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.599
What's is it?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.786
Someone went into our house,
Victor and Sasha are dead

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.830
Find whoever did this.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.069
And bring them directly to me.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.228
What's this world comin' to, huh?

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.509
When I was a young man, we used to
settle our disputes with this.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.342
Words were exchanged,
before gun shots.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.484
People KNEW what was coming
to them... and why.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.186
These days, they shoot first.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.879
There's no rationale, no protocol,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.228
nothing but blood and confusion.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.340
How are we supposed to know
what these men want?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.382
Oh, shit!

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.703
Hello?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.039
There should be almost three, big bunch
of Russian guys had just gotten out.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.759
How long will it take you
and Doherty to get over?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.030
- I thought he was with you.
- No, man, he's not with me.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.026
Just make it fast.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.030
Hang-up and try...

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.708
Come on!

01:03:57.381 --> 01:04:00.106
God damn it, Danny, take
it off, they got Kane!

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.103
Danny!

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.147
Go, go, go!

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.039
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Me!? What the hell is wrong with you?

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.024
- Cuff him!
- Come on!

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.708
Get off him!

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:36.797
Get off!

01:06:36.811 --> 01:06:39.759
Are you tryin' to kill everyone
in this city? Look at me!

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.959
Go to hell!

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.299
What the hell's goin' on, Maguire?

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.759
This asshole let the
kidnappers get away.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.870
I'd like to ask you a few questions
concerning your whereabouts last night.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.119
I'm trying to help you here,
you got clean once,

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.581
do it again.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.149
Walk away, let us do OUR job.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.979
We'll find who killed your daughter,
I promise you, Paul.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.151
- It's a top priority.
- Bullshit.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.359
I knew you heard about
the ballistic report.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.904
Personally, a couple of
dead vory brightens my day.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.505
So, why are they after you?

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.303
What did you do?
Did you piss someone off?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.061
Can I go now?

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.319
Sir, are you serious?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.987
- I'll take care of this.
- You gonna let him walk?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.746
Thanks, Peter, I owe you one.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.988
Hey, Paul.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.585
Watch your back, man.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.461
Mr. Kane, you know, who I am, right?

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.062
Not personally, no.
We've never met.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.944
Your name is Chernov,
and you're the bad guy.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.825
That is quite funny,

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.519
coming from someone who's responsible
for the death of several of my men.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.879
Can you offer me an explanation
for your behavior, please.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.859
Explanation, I should be
asking you the same thing.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.461
Anton, please,
allow me to handle this.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.823
Maybe a little water will
help loosen your belt up.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.106
Drink up.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.867
There.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.148
That'll not explain things.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.024
Others don't explain.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:13.064
I ask questions,

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.424
you answer them, understand?

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.319
That's sexy, I like that.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:37.067
- I taught you to do that.
- Tell the stripper to leave, Danny.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.984
- Paulie, what's up, buddy?
- Where were you, Danny?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.301
Get out, grab your stuff, get out.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.902
What's up?

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.024
You didn't check your phone?

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.020
I was just blowing-off a
little steam with Amber.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.059
Why aren't you at your house?

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.067
'Cause you don't bang strippers in
your home. What's going on?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.947
- They got Kane.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.623
And you didn't answer your phone.

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.021
I told you, I was havin' fun, I...

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.199
All this action, I couldn't
wind-down, I needed a release.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.999
While you were gettn' high,
and getting your dick wet,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.029
they got Kane.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.585
Paulie, let me get you
a drink, all right?

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.750
How's the old bladder feeling?

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.267
Is it full?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.070
Why are you killing my men?

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.519
Why would you be so stupid, huh?

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.221
What could you
possibly have to gain.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.261
I can do it much longer than you can.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.666
- Caitlin Maguire.
- Who?

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.902
You killed Caitlin Maguire, Paul
Maguire's daughter, that's the truth.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.106
The former criminal,
who lost his daughter?

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.181
- He thinks I did it?
- He knows you did it.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.551
That is a terrible accusation.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.941
Why would I kill the little girl?

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.863
Why would I do such a thing?

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.345
She was killed with that
Russian gun, a Tokarev.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.428
You're not looking so good, Mr. Kane.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.023
I can stop if you like.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.661
Why?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.582
Revenge.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.200
We hit the bank guard for the money.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.665
We cut his hand off, we killed him.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.865
We were kids.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.826
You killed Ivan?

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.948
You killed my brother?

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.262
You started that war.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.982
Call that gimp O'Connell.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.950
When was your stint?

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.199
Four years ago I got out.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.679
- And how long were you inside?
- What difference does it make?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.665
Just answer the question, how long?

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.747
Five years on an eight year sentence.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.799
Aggravated assault, possession.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.309
Right, yeah, I remember
when it went down.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.224
All over the papers.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.789
A crate full of Israeli sub-machine
guns and all you got was possession.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.739
- Plea bargain?
- No!

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.239
- And I don't like what you're gettin' at.
- What am I getting at?

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.319
- Paulie...
- No one has one clue who killed my daughter.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.335
Not one.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.219
Took-up all those Russians last night,
not a single one of them knew anything,

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.159
if they did, they woulda
cracked, so YOU tell me.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.979
Paulie, I did not rat and you know
I wouldn't rat, it was the driver.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.839
He didn't know shit! Never saw our
faces, never knew what hit him.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.759
- Paulie, listen to me.
- But you shot him!

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.710
So, now, we'll never know.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.519
Paulie, you gotta listen to me, all right?
Just listen to me.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.600
- The whole reason I'm back with O'Connell?
- Uh-huh?

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.919
Is because I didn't
drop a dime on nobody!

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.379
I got a light rap because they
misplaced some of the evidence.

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.799
How about, still, you went down
nine years ago, so that was what?

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.319
What? That was two, three years
after we split the cash?

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.359
So, what are you getting at?

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.599
The weapons you got caught with, did you use
the money to buy them, and don't lie to me.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.790
Yeah, of course I did. What the hell?
What's the big deal?

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.479
What's the big deal?

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.902
They took Caitlin and they shot her.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.719
Maybe... maybe that's not a big deal to you,
but it's a pretty fuckin' big deal to me.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.476
And the only reason they would do
something like that is if someone talked.

01:15:06.477 --> 01:15:09.279
No one asked you, no one asked you where
you got the money for those guns.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.799
O'Connell didn't want to know how you knew how you
could pull-off something like that on your own?

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.959
- Paulie!
- Yeah?

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.991
- I've always been loyal.
- You've always been an idiot!

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.999
Screw you, Paulie!

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.239
Nothing's ever your fault.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.659
There's always someone else to blame,

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.279
always someone there
to bail you out.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.719
Who... who's bailing you out now?
Who's man are you now?

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.999
Are you my man?
Are you Chernov's man?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.923
- Are you O'Connell's man?
- Take it easy, Paulie! Easy!

01:15:32.924 --> 01:15:36.223
- Knock it off!
- You talked!!!!!

01:15:36.224 --> 01:15:36.999
I didn't talk!

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:37.879
Someone got to your boss.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.019
- They take care of you, make those guns go away.
- That's not what...

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.079
O'Connell talked,
and now my daughter's dead!

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.759
We swore not to talk about it,

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.639
not to spend the money,
not to draw attention to ourselves!

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.399
- I'm not a rat!
- You are a rat!

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.271
- Rat! Rat! Rat!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.387
You... you swore it!

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.862
Paulie, shit, man!

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.345
I loved you, and you swore.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.183
Danny, come on, Danny.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.988
Danny.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.661
You got to get up, Man.
Get up, Danny!

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.028
Danny.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.429
I 'm with you, bro.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.630
What is so damned important you had to pull
me away from my nephew's football game?

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.389
Anton.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.630
I believe that belongs to you.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.388
No, hasn't been mine
for many, many years.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.749
- I have no responsibility.
- Responsibility, huh?

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.903
When I was nineteen years old,

01:17:36.038 --> 01:17:37.308
I was the number one,

01:17:37.334 --> 01:17:42.265
light heavyweight champion in the Soviet
Olympic Boxing Team, did you know this?

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.742
No, I don't like sports.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.421
And especially not Soviet Sports.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.119
I had a shot at number one.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.643
I could have been the champion, except
my father had a little problem.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:01.259
He was a pathetic gambler,

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:04.399
and he could no longer pay his debt.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.899
The Russian Mob, the Brita,
placed the burden on my shoulders.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:14.622
I could clear his debt by taking a
fall by losing to the champion.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.469
What do you think I did?

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.119
- I don't know, I don't have a clue, fill me in.
- Doesn't have a clue.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.505
I took a beating for my father,
I lost for him.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.662
No child should have to pay
for their father's sins.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:33.384
But the Bratwa took me in,

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.279
gave me new life.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.119
When my father fell
for the debt again,

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.582
who do you think they
sent to collect?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.063
Me.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.302
My father failed, just as
your man here failed you.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.188
I told you he's not mine any longer,
are you deaf?

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.107
You know the Maguire fellow,
the one in the news?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.985
The one whose daughter'd
been killed, huh?

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.146
What about him?

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.101
He was the one who
killed my brother.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.470
He was the one who started
the war between us.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.199
The one who landed
you in that chair.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.911
So you see...

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.946
I invited you here to ask
you to do one thing for me.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.938
Take responsibility.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.222
Let me make one thing clear,

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.159
I don't take orders
from people like you.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.189
Russian scumbag!

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.623
Do what you have to do.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.471
Whatever it takes.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.707
Tokarev,

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.711
TT-33.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.066
It's an old army sidearm.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.908
It's a favorite of the Russian Mafia.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.546
No, no, do not!

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.389
Evan!

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.663
Evan!

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.506
What was so important?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.864
I'm sorry, Mike.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.989
What?

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.467
Sorry.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.991
It was an accident...

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.226
No! Please!

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:40.380
I didn't mean to! C'mon, you have to
believe me! No, no, please, please no.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.229
Okay,

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.171
We... we... we were hanging out,
and drinking, as normal,

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.670
and... and... and talking about...
about how you used to be a gangster.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.584
So, where does he
keep the loot, huh?

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.759
Shut up!

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.399
C'mon, how many times do I have
to tell you guys, my dad is a...

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.782
A legitimate businessman.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.679
Yes.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.028
Yeah, has he ever been arrested?

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.679
Maybe YOU should ask
him when he gets home.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.199
No... Honestly, he kinda
scares the shit outta me.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.308
Pussy.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.943
Have you ever seen
or heard anything?

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.586
Like secret phone calls
or wads of cash lying around?

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.599
- Wait, did you see that?
- Totally.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.799
- Did you see that?
- Come on, you know something,

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.908
something cool.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.029
Come on, spill it.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.827
Caitlin, please...

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.829
All right.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.548
Serious?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.868
Yeah, yeah, I'll show you something.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:48.989
Yes...

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.030
We went upstairs, she... she said
she had something cool to show us.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.071
I'd never held a gun
before, you know.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.759
It... it... it was
scary and cool and,

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.950
I know I shoulda put it down.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.505
But I didn't.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.628
Take some of this, you assholes!

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.439
Evan, come on,
don't make me chase you!

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.742
- Come on, let's go!
- It's raining.

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.941
So what, it's rain.
Are you gonna melt?

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.239
All right, come on, Evan,
we gotta put it back.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.919
- No! It's not even loaded!
- Don't be an asshole, c'mon.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.429
- Give it over.
- Fine, buzzkill, jeez.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.910
Jesus, you, too?

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.110
All right, hand it over.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.790
Oh God! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.471
Is she dead?

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.503
No!

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.224
I didn't hear her coming.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.079
I wasn't paying attention,

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.779
I was a little drunk, and... and...
and the gun was so cool, you know.

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.679
And it felt...

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.586
I didn't know she was
gonna be right behind me!

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.709
I...

01:25:46.973 --> 01:25:50.239
It was an accident.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.110
I didn't know what to do.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.866
We dragged her into the woods.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.346
We put the guns back,

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.059
we trashed the house to make
it seem like a home invasion.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.142
I figured... with your history,

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.663
the cops would think it was
a mob hit or something.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.789
I'm so sorry,

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.790
I didn't want to kill her.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.119
I was scared. I was scared!
I loved her,

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.991
I swear to God, I loved her so much.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.710
Please say something!

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.583
Just end this.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.468
Please.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.829
I can't take it anymore.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.668
Please.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.181
Hey, baby.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.703
Hi.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.671
It's okay now.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.071
It's all over.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.383
It's good to hear your voice.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.279
Come home, know you'll be safe now,

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.503
Are you okay? You sound so...

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.383
I killed a man,
when I was seventeen.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.425
Caitlin's age.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.744
I got into a fight.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.701
Someone handed me a knife.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.146
Sometimes I dream about that night.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.229
In the dream I see myself,

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.141
and I try to stop it, but I can't.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.903
Then I wake up,

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.907
and I wonder what
would have happened,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.621
if no one handed me that knife.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.626
What my life,

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.145
what our lives,

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.711
might have been.

01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:35.312
Paul.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.066
I'm sorry I let you down.

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.469
Paul?

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.143
Paul!
