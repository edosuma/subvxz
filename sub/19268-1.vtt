01:18.080 --> 01:21.310
Things that should be remembered are forgotten.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.790
Things that should be forgotten are remembered, the irony.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.190
Thus, the past is still our homework.

01:29.930 --> 01:33.360
Like the unspoken promise of a year ago...

01:33.360 --> 01:35.010
...the story of that winter...

01:35.010 --> 01:37.130
...the warehouse incident from before.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.320
It all starts from somewhere.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.539
<i>Last season... </i>

02:08.539 --> 02:10.539
<i>What's happening? </i>

02:10.539 --> 02:12.790
<i>This is the same crime. </i>

02:12.790 --> 02:14.080
<i>Do you think it's another imitation? </i>

02:14.840 --> 02:15.750
<i>I'm not sure... </i>

02:16.490 --> 02:18.480
<i>From her eyes to her lips... </i>

02:18.480 --> 02:20.970
<i>...the culprit placed the tape very strategically. </i>

02:20.970 --> 02:23.160
<i>It's the same crime from 7 years ago. </i>

02:23.160 --> 02:25.500
<i>This time, it's the original. </i>

02:26.210 --> 02:29.240
<i>Stop getting distracted and just drag his neck over here! </i>

02:29.980 --> 02:33.110
<i>Chief. I can't do it. </i>

02:33.840 --> 02:36.140
<i>I just wanted to become a monster. </i>

02:36.140 --> 02:39.340
<i>So, that I could catch the monster. </i>

02:42.240 --> 02:44.710
<i>Hiding after the case comes out... </i>

02:44.710 --> 02:48.950
<i>How is this case related to the Director? </i>

02:48.950 --> 02:51.380
<i>Why Yeo Ji Hoon is hiding... </i>

02:51.380 --> 02:53.010
<i>What happened then? </i>

02:53.010 --> 02:54.880
<i>Who the culprit is... </i>

02:55.910 --> 02:58.270
<i>All those answers are in the past. </i>

03:00.770 --> 03:01.980
<i>What is this? </i>

03:02.710 --> 03:03.830
<i>The past. </i>

03:03.830 --> 03:05.500
<i>The so-called F cases. </i>

03:05.500 --> 03:07.740
<i>What exactly is this F case? </i>

03:07.740 --> 03:10.080
<i>It's the case that the Director was obsessed with. </i>

03:10.080 --> 03:12.650
<i>It seems like it was related to his past somehow. </i>

03:12.650 --> 03:14.080
<i>But why is it F? </i>

03:14.080 --> 03:16.490
<i>All the cases happened on a Friday... </i>

03:16.490 --> 03:19.820
<i>The culprit was obsessed with faces... </i>

03:19.820 --> 03:21.730
<i>All the victims are females. </i>

03:21.730 --> 03:23.460
<i>Friday! </i>

03:23.460 --> 03:25.390
<i>Face! </i>

03:26.010 --> 03:26.990
<i>Female! </i>

03:26.990 --> 03:29.810
<i>Do you think she'll remember in that condition? </i>

03:29.810 --> 03:32.500
<i>Just sit tight.
It'll be over soon. </i>

03:34.580 --> 03:35.580
<i>She took the bait. </i>

03:35.580 --> 03:36.720
<i>Someone is coming. </i>

03:39.460 --> 03:40.540
<i>Is it you? </i>

03:41.510 --> 03:43.170
<i>Fire! </i>

03:43.170 --> 03:45.680
<i>Room 201! </i>

03:46.700 --> 03:50.410
<i>She disappeared! </i>

03:53.210 --> 03:55.360
<i>How could this have happened? </i>

03:55.800 --> 03:57.530
<i>It was a false alarm. </i>

03:58.600 --> 04:00.050
<i>You should see this. </i>

04:00.690 --> 04:01.760
<i>Go in. </i>

04:10.610 --> 04:14.030
<i>Hee Joo! Hee Joo! </i>

04:21.269 --> 04:24.410
<i>Why is the F man making another appearance after 7 years? </i>

04:24.410 --> 04:27.440
<i>Another team is on this case. </i>

04:27.440 --> 04:29.940
<i>Go back to your original place. </i>

04:31.940 --> 04:33.710
<i>Look at this. </i>

04:38.550 --> 04:40.270
<i>Second wind? </i>

04:40.270 --> 04:43.620
<i>If this message was meant for us,
what does that mean? </i>

04:47.410 --> 04:49.030
[Episode 1]

04:49.030 --> 04:51.580
If the Director asked us to run with him...

04:51.580 --> 04:54.430
Shouldn't he tell us how we're supposed to be running?

04:56.860 --> 04:58.160
Yeo Ji Hoon...

04:58.680 --> 05:00.190
Yeo Ji Hoon...

05:03.240 --> 05:05.880
What could he be thinking?

05:07.630 --> 05:09.850
Yeh Ri!
Have you found anything?

05:09.850 --> 05:13.210
Were there any more messages left at the Director's house?

05:13.210 --> 05:16.540
The recorded address on file is at the Police Training Institute.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.480
But they wiped it clean.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.810
Let alone, a message...

05:22.800 --> 05:24.480
Let's just give up!

05:24.940 --> 05:26.270
This isn't a joke.

05:26.270 --> 05:28.740
Tell him to deal with whatever he's doing alone!

05:28.740 --> 05:31.220
Let's just disband. Okay?

05:31.220 --> 05:33.860
This is great.
We had some great times.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.500
Yes?

05:48.430 --> 05:50.430
Min Ho, how did you become a part of the Ten team?

05:52.450 --> 05:54.480
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.100
- Nam Yeh Ri?
- Yes?

05:58.340 --> 05:59.330
Well, I...

06:02.740 --> 06:04.330
There's no particular reason.
Both of you.

06:06.590 --> 06:07.900
As for me...

06:07.900 --> 06:10.550
I stuck around because Yeo Ji Hoon promised that...

06:10.550 --> 06:13.260
...he'd introduce me to a marriage counselor.

06:13.260 --> 06:16.020
He said he'd give me plenty of vacation if we didn't have a case.

06:16.660 --> 06:20.080
Why are you bringing that up right now?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.230
I want to say that things just ended up like this somehow.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.670
But I don't think that's it.

06:28.670 --> 06:32.030
Seo Eun Bi, Kim Eun Young Imitation Tape Murder Case.

06:32.030 --> 06:33.960
Why is this here?

06:34.610 --> 06:37.860
Inside this box full of F files?

06:38.370 --> 06:42.250
That's because... it's an imitation of the F case... for reference...

06:42.250 --> 06:43.610
Why is this a reference?

06:45.050 --> 06:47.110
What did Yeo Ji Hoon contribute to this case?

06:47.980 --> 06:50.730
Whether it was Eun Young or Eun Bi...

06:50.730 --> 06:54.220
Finding out that the younger twin was putting on an act? That's it.

06:54.220 --> 06:55.610
That's true...

06:56.870 --> 06:58.140
Actually...

06:58.140 --> 07:01.240
If it weren't for us, he'd still be wandering around.

07:02.020 --> 07:02.980
Then...

07:03.700 --> 07:06.720
So, he put that into the F files...

07:06.720 --> 07:09.170
There's something he missed.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.210
Even if he was obsessed with this for 7 years...

07:12.210 --> 07:14.280
There could be something he missed.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.250
That's what he realized.

07:17.250 --> 07:21.030
If he has us here,
he'd be able to see it?

07:21.830 --> 07:23.770
What does that mean?

07:23.770 --> 07:28.310
The reason why the Director is holding onto the Ten team...

07:29.360 --> 07:32.860
This jerk didn't care about the Ten team at all in the beginning.

07:33.590 --> 07:37.120
He's just using us to find this F or whatever it is.

07:43.770 --> 07:48.100
I now know why he left this here.

07:49.690 --> 07:54.880
He wants us to find the hidden picture while he goes into hiding.

07:56.200 --> 08:01.380
The hidden picture he couldn't find for the past 7 years.

08:03.230 --> 08:07.000
[Finding the Hidden Picture]

08:57.530 --> 08:59.790
Wow, this is impressive.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.090
This is the last 7 years for Yeo Ji Hoon.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.490
Can we find anything else?

09:05.490 --> 09:07.760
Director Yeo already found this much.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.420
Hey! What do you mean?

09:10.420 --> 09:13.330
To be honest, Yeo Ji Hoon talks loud but there's nothing else.

09:13.330 --> 09:17.210
The person responsible for taking us in the new direction is...

09:17.210 --> 09:18.370
Nam Yeh Ri!

09:19.930 --> 09:22.030
Then, what about you?

09:22.030 --> 09:25.860
Thanks to you we were able to dig into those cases at its core.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.280
If we put all of our strengths together...

09:28.280 --> 09:32.670
It's only a matter of time before we catch that F guy!

09:35.220 --> 09:36.680
But...

09:36.680 --> 09:40.160
I know why the Director chose you two.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
But, why did he choose me?

09:43.490 --> 09:46.460
There must be a big reason.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.150
Was it because I'm good looking?

09:50.790 --> 09:53.370
Where should we start first?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.100
Ah! Yes... Well...

09:57.300 --> 09:58.790
Let's start with the clown murder.

09:58.790 --> 09:59.810
Yes!

10:00.670 --> 10:02.710
There has to be a reason!

10:02.710 --> 10:04.920
Just think about it!

10:13.830 --> 10:20.470
[November 14, 2003, Friday
Victim: Moon Hye Jin]

10:22.310 --> 10:26.580
Moon Hye Jin was with a man that night.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.090
The bastard that sold her a ticket that Friday night.

10:29.090 --> 10:32.010
The way I saw it, it was definitely that guy.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.610
People start going crazy once it hits Friday night.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.540
I was totally out of it today.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.400
You too?

10:49.710 --> 10:52.320
Is your blood rising?

11:02.450 --> 11:03.630
Do you drink coffee?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.970
But no matter how hard we look,
there's nothing there.

11:06.970 --> 11:10.780
This bastard is the first in my 10 years of police work.

11:11.510 --> 11:15.910
No one else saw his face except for the dead Moon Hye Jin.

11:15.910 --> 11:20.270
When we finally found his identity,
we realized it was forged.

11:21.420 --> 11:25.660
First F case
< Clown Murder >

11:27.490 --> 11:30.410
He came in like a ghost and left like a ghost.

11:32.670 --> 11:35.940
Has it been 3 months since I've tried to find the guy?

11:36.580 --> 11:38.230
He never showed up.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.030
Looks like you went everywhere...

11:41.030 --> 11:42.740
Wait but...

11:42.740 --> 11:44.780
His identity verification isn't in the investigation records.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.400
- It's not?
- No.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.640
It should be in there.

11:48.650 --> 11:50.080
Did it fall out?

11:51.030 --> 11:55.140
I even looked through Chinese deliverymen and old store owners...

11:56.080 --> 11:57.900
Wait! Then, is it in here?

11:59.270 --> 12:02.010
I think I saw it here.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.100
Didn't a young Detective from the Regional Investigation Unit come just for this case?

12:15.980 --> 12:17.290
Regional Investigation Unit?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.810
Oh, right!

12:20.810 --> 12:22.720
Someone from there did come.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.760
Smacking on his gum...

12:24.760 --> 12:27.300
Did he come just for fun?

12:27.300 --> 12:28.620
Crazy bastard.

12:29.650 --> 12:32.830
The Director has the identity verification in here.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.150
Senior!

12:37.990 --> 12:40.350
We'll be on our way.

12:41.050 --> 12:42.390
- Thank you.
- Really?

12:43.800 --> 12:47.370
This data doesn't look like it's been here that long.

12:47.370 --> 12:49.250
When did you close the case?

12:51.280 --> 12:55.660
Because bar girls do this kind of stuff often...

12:56.500 --> 13:00.290
When I ask for the killer,
they say there's no evidence...

13:00.290 --> 13:03.100
They say there's no witnesses.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.680
It just sounds like there's nothing all together.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.640
When I look at those Detectives...

13:11.640 --> 13:14.140
I can tell they're not going to catch anybody.

13:18.250 --> 13:22.370
This really shows her worth in this country.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.120
Miss Detective?

13:33.450 --> 13:35.420
Let me ask you one thing.

13:36.830 --> 13:39.140
Because she was a girl who sold drinks and her body for money.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.470
Is that why no one's looking for the culprit?

13:45.260 --> 13:48.090
Looks like the Director already made his mark here.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.930
Wait, but it's not like there's anything else to investigate.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.420
Why does he keep the files like that?

13:52.420 --> 13:56.260
He's not just keeping it.
He's burying it, you punk.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.900
No matter how great of a Detective you are...

13:58.900 --> 14:02.530
If there's a case you never solved,
you keep it buried in your heart until you die.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.660
Remember that.

14:15.890 --> 14:22.300
June 4, 2004, Friday
Victim: Song Mi Joo

14:25.990 --> 14:28.260
Oh! Mi Joo...

14:28.260 --> 14:31.810
Always smiling brightly and so polite...

14:31.810 --> 14:35.210
Who could have imagined she would be doing those things?

14:43.600 --> 14:46.780
No one in her family even knew.

14:46.780 --> 14:52.220
Everyone in the neighborhood was saying "No way, no way" for awhile.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.860
Second F case
< Wrap Murder >

14:56.610 --> 15:02.600
They accused the mom of forcing her daughter to work at a bar.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.050
The whole family ran away overnight and that's it.

15:05.050 --> 15:07.120
Instead of someone dying...

15:07.120 --> 15:11.230
It seems like they were more interested in what the girl did.

15:11.230 --> 15:14.620
Well... that's how it came on the news.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.130
I'm not sure about that but...

15:17.130 --> 15:21.780
After they found out the daughter had a man, people went crazy.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.780
Ah! Yes!

15:26.710 --> 15:28.740
There was a man...

15:35.810 --> 15:38.710
After the incident, people kept saying they'd never come back.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.590
But they did.

15:40.590 --> 15:44.660
Has it been 2 years now?
Since this came in?

15:47.270 --> 15:50.930
Song Mi Joo was reported missing
June 4, 2004.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.690
But her body was found on August 21.

15:53.690 --> 15:56.360
If you calculate from the day she was missing, then that means...

15:56.360 --> 15:58.750
...the body was abandoned for 2 months?

15:58.750 --> 16:02.600
This place is too remote and smelly for people to come here often.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.980
Is the place where her body was found far from here?

16:04.980 --> 16:08.100
Over there across the bridge.
5 minutes by car.

16:22.820 --> 16:25.260
The body was intentionally left out in the open.

16:25.260 --> 16:29.850
With this place, there was no intention of covering up the murder.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.360
This bastard is really something!

16:32.360 --> 16:35.450
This guy seems crazy enough to want to advertise his murder.

16:35.450 --> 16:38.710
He was never caught so he must be skilled, bastard...

16:55.210 --> 16:56.210
Detective Baek!

16:58.580 --> 17:00.600
This was the next F case, right?

17:01.660 --> 17:04.060
The murder with the black vinyl.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.260
Probably?

17:06.260 --> 17:10.430
I think I know where that incident took place.

17:13.109 --> 17:14.520
Detective Park!

17:27.000 --> 17:28.099
Hey!

17:34.350 --> 17:36.680
Where are we going?

17:52.420 --> 17:54.460
Here!

17:54.460 --> 17:56.310
The body was right here.

17:57.070 --> 17:58.980
How do you know?

17:59.650 --> 18:05.160
I was here before.
7 years ago.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.780
It's a murder case, isn't it?

18:11.780 --> 18:13.460
Come with me, you punk!

18:20.960 --> 18:23.520
September 10, 2004, Friday
Victim: Choi Hyun Jung

18:23.520 --> 18:26.950
Their only daughter went to Seoul University.

18:26.950 --> 18:32.560
She gave her parents allowance through her part time job.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.320
Her mother went around bragging.

18:38.540 --> 18:44.140
One day, the allowance stopped coming.

18:44.140 --> 18:46.310
They couldn't get in touch with her.

18:46.310 --> 18:51.220
So the mother and aunt went to go look for her.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.050
Where did you buy these roses at this hour?

19:04.840 --> 19:07.600
She was recorded absent at school.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.550
She was never in the dormitories.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.730
The mother reported her as missing.

19:20.730 --> 19:24.250
Two months went by without a word.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.160
The mother went to go see if she was dead.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.800
Third F case
< Black Vinyl Murder >

19:30.870 --> 19:36.940
The mother who loved the money her daughter was making at a bar...

19:36.940 --> 19:39.560
How shocked must the father have been!

19:39.560 --> 19:41.530
How humiliating.

19:44.210 --> 19:47.240
Then, what about Choi Hyun Jung's mother?

19:47.240 --> 19:51.330
Her mother is still in denial...

19:51.330 --> 19:54.070
She still waits by the police office everyday.

19:54.070 --> 19:57.120
For them to find her daughter's murderer.

19:59.170 --> 20:01.080
Detective Baek! Look here.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.600
X is the murder site.
O is where the body was abandoned.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.670
The police region is different but...

20:07.670 --> 20:10.660
The murder site and the site of abandonment are only a few km apart.

20:12.560 --> 20:16.450
This bastard must know this are like the back of his hand.

20:16.450 --> 20:17.920
Kinda like you.

20:18.830 --> 20:22.760
That's why he was able to move the body around without anyone noticing.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.040
Director Yeo had this in his memo.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.160
"F is an expert in this home ground."

20:30.160 --> 20:32.510
Ah! Damn...

20:32.510 --> 20:35.800
I'm having a hard time following along let alone this hidden picture.

20:38.310 --> 20:40.690
You're going to the Regional Police District, right?

20:40.690 --> 20:42.790
I'll meet you after I stop by somewhere else.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.450
Where are you going?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.850
This kid is getting excited!

20:49.450 --> 20:51.280
Regional Police...

21:02.870 --> 21:04.820
Wow! White Viper!

21:04.820 --> 21:08.580
You're getting more bald!

21:09.190 --> 21:11.130
How long has it been?

21:11.130 --> 21:14.200
The last time was when your wife ran away so 7 years, you bastard.

22:09.010 --> 22:12.780
Why are you looking for this old case all of a sudden?

22:12.780 --> 22:15.890
Too long to explain...

22:16.890 --> 22:18.530
2004...

22:19.520 --> 22:22.610
Victim was Choi Hyun Jung.

22:22.610 --> 22:23.980
Here it is.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.870
Let's see who the Detective in charge was...

22:27.870 --> 22:29.070
Who is it?

22:31.370 --> 22:34.080
- What?
- You little...

22:34.080 --> 22:36.150
Why? What is it?

22:53.930 --> 22:54.980
<i>I'm tired of this... </i>

22:54.980 --> 22:56.690
<i>I'm not going to Kwang Won Do. </i>

22:56.690 --> 22:58.690
<i>I'm never going back. </i>

22:58.690 --> 23:03.390
<i>I'm just going to live there. </i>

23:10.680 --> 23:12.430
It's you!

23:12.430 --> 23:14.900
How could you forget your own case?

23:14.900 --> 23:17.190
Especially an unsolved one...

23:18.010 --> 23:20.280
And I call myself a Detective...

23:21.790 --> 23:24.090
And I call myself a Detective...

23:36.690 --> 23:40.580
<i>Her mother is still in denial... </i>

23:40.580 --> 23:44.040
<i>She still waits by the police office everyday </i>

23:44.040 --> 23:47.740
<i>for them to find her daughter's murderer. </i>

24:06.340 --> 24:07.760
That flier...

24:52.520 --> 24:58.490
Friday... Face... Female...

24:58.490 --> 25:03.720
These cases had another thing in common.

25:03.720 --> 25:07.310
They were forgotten memories.

25:07.310 --> 25:11.180
For me... for Detective Baek...

25:11.180 --> 25:13.180
And for Min Ho...

25:25.280 --> 25:28.520
Wow! The three of us-

25:28.520 --> 25:32.590
- including the Director were all related to this crime somehow.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.810
It's kind of creepy.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.910
This case wasn't unresolved because I couldn't solve it.

25:40.910 --> 25:44.540
It would be an unresolved crime once the public forgot about it.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.250
I was the Detective in charge.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.600
I guess the person who made things turn out this way was me.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.440
While we just forgot...

25:52.440 --> 25:56.110
The victim's families were living alone in pain.

25:56.110 --> 26:00.130
No one to tell them how their daughter died, who killed her...

26:00.130 --> 26:02.990
And now...

26:02.990 --> 26:06.900
There's no one left that knows.

26:08.460 --> 26:09.760
One person.

26:10.840 --> 26:14.150
There's still one person that remembers.

26:22.230 --> 26:24.740
Regional Investigation Unit's Ace,
Yeo Ji Hoon.

26:24.740 --> 26:26.930
Gum-smacking Yeo Ji Hoon.

26:28.310 --> 26:34.650
This monster was some people's last hope of catching the culprit.

26:37.760 --> 26:42.430
From now on, this isn't Yeo Ji Hoon's game anymore.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.590
It's our problem now.

26:44.590 --> 26:50.990
Since this is his home ground,
I don't think we'll find anything else.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.020
Then, is it time for the away game?

27:22.620 --> 27:25.720
The Dae Jeon Tape Murder was on September 24th.

27:25.720 --> 27:29.000
Since the Il San police couldn't find anything for 2 months,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.450
it got moved to the Special Investigation Bureau.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.130
They too couldn't find anything.

27:33.130 --> 27:35.750
They brought in Yeo Ji Hoon from Seoul.

27:35.750 --> 27:39.450
Since Yeo Ji Hoon already came in knowing about the F case.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.580
Let's investigate from here.

27:42.580 --> 27:46.090
Yeh RI, let's take the first train to Dae Jeon.

27:46.090 --> 27:47.270
Okay.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.050
What about me?

27:49.050 --> 27:50.490
You!

27:52.160 --> 27:54.860
Just stay here.
The ticket is too expensive.

27:54.860 --> 27:58.040
Just find anything.
Anything!

27:58.040 --> 27:59.150
What?

27:59.150 --> 28:01.670
I've been watching over you and...

28:02.370 --> 28:06.450
You have a cow's reverse luck.

28:06.450 --> 28:08.380
Cow's reverse luck?

28:08.380 --> 28:10.000
What is that?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.810
Finding something by luck.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.010
Do what you can to find the hole.

28:17.010 --> 28:18.930
The hole that Yeo Ji Hoon missed.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.370
Let's go.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.540
Dae Jeon Tape Murder
Victim: Song Kyung Mi, Location

28:31.540 --> 28:34.190
Sorry for bothering you so early in the morning.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.520
Wow, this place is pretty wide.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.470
Does the hot water work well?

28:48.510 --> 28:52.270
I've never been this humiliated since the day I was born.

28:52.270 --> 28:55.000
Coming from an old, bald man.

28:56.330 --> 28:57.550
What?

28:57.550 --> 28:59.360
Cow's reverse luck?

29:01.070 --> 29:05.790
I'll show you how fast this cow will find this hole!

29:17.030 --> 29:18.410
Great coffee!

29:18.410 --> 29:22.890
But it's better than the people who listen but don't do anything.

29:22.890 --> 29:24.120
That's right.

29:24.120 --> 29:30.590
If you're a real Detective you'd want to check the scene of the crime yourself.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.290
It's just a habit.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.600
Has he stopped now?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.180
Does it seem like he did?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.100
This little bastard...

29:43.100 --> 29:47.540
The victim opened the door because she didn't expect trespassing.

29:47.540 --> 29:50.050
The first thing in front of him?

29:50.050 --> 29:51.770
The back of her head.

29:51.770 --> 29:58.780
That means the woman turned around without any hesitation.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.120
Acquaintance?

30:01.120 --> 30:03.100
The funny thing is...

30:03.100 --> 30:07.320
This should've been solved in 3 days but no one knew for a month.

30:08.970 --> 30:10.820
I heard she was dating someone at the time.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.620
I'm sure she did.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.890
But he's a ghost.

30:14.890 --> 30:17.790
There were a lot of rumors but he never existed in reality.

30:17.790 --> 30:21.830
There's no one who actually saw his face in months.

30:25.770 --> 30:28.700
Even when I think about it now,
I'm still shocked.

30:28.700 --> 30:34.070
She was completely smitten and only talked about her boyfriend.

30:34.070 --> 30:37.890
But, no one could ever find the guy.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.560
So, I just looked like a crazy person.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.820
Did you know she had a younger sister?

30:43.820 --> 30:47.860
She has no address and we couldn't find her no matter who we asked.

30:47.860 --> 30:50.180
I know. The college student.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.750
It was just her and her sister.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.980
Well, you know what I mean...

30:54.980 --> 30:57.490
She ruined her life so she wanted to take care of her sister.

30:58.820 --> 31:03.970
After the funeral, she came asking if her sister really worked there.

31:03.970 --> 31:07.090
She couldn't stop crying.
She really had no idea.

31:07.090 --> 31:10.500
I don't know anything after that.
Nothing really happened.

31:12.190 --> 31:15.800
What kind of person was Kyung Mi?

31:21.920 --> 31:25.790
There are 2 kinds of people who work in this business.

31:25.790 --> 31:28.670
Girls who look like they would.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.720
And girls that don't.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.430
Kyung Mi was the latter.

31:33.460 --> 31:42.700
<i>The police have still not found the suspect in this bizarre murder. </i>

31:42.700 --> 31:49.460
<i>Meanwhile, we've received a tip from the police about a serial killer... </i>

31:53.440 --> 31:58.910
Since this case has been going on for so long, there should be new hunches.

32:00.230 --> 32:02.710
What kind of person could he be?
That guy...

32:03.920 --> 32:06.160
Now that I think about it...

32:06.160 --> 32:09.730
This guy's main strength was camouflage.

32:09.730 --> 32:10.840
Camouflage?

32:10.840 --> 32:13.090
He appears, then disappears...

32:13.090 --> 32:14.790
He makes a mess, then cleans it up...

32:14.790 --> 32:16.790
Says something, changes it...

32:18.770 --> 32:20.520
Do you know the Mafia game?

32:20.520 --> 32:23.050
All the kids are playing it these days.

32:23.050 --> 32:27.050
It's just a simple game where the citizens catch the Mafia.

32:27.050 --> 32:32.590
But, the Mafia drive around the good citizens too.

32:32.590 --> 32:37.760
Once they plant the lie,
the innocent citizens start dying off.

32:37.760 --> 32:43.200
Then, the Mafia must have had to have a good camouflage.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.260
There's another thing.

32:45.260 --> 32:48.410
They need to be close to the people.

32:48.410 --> 32:50.270
Acting like a citizen.

33:01.710 --> 33:06.140
What's with your form? Did you drink?

33:10.060 --> 33:14.000
<i>The recent Dae Jeon bizarre murder case in September... </i>

33:14.000 --> 33:21.090
<i>The police have still not found the suspect in this bizarre murder. </i>

33:21.090 --> 33:23.330
<i>While it's been a week... </i>

33:23.330 --> 33:28.530
<i>Meanwhile, we've received a tip from the police about a serial killer... </i>

33:30.230 --> 33:32.980
The tip about the serial killer...

33:32.980 --> 33:36.570
...was released by the police,
making the situation grow bigger.

33:42.790 --> 33:46.490
The tip that there might have been a serial killer...

33:46.490 --> 33:49.370
...was released from the police...

33:51.180 --> 33:53.610
You still don't get it?

33:55.700 --> 33:59.310
The suspect that no one could ever find anything about...

33:59.310 --> 34:03.380
The tip that made everyone go nuts in just one day was...

34:03.380 --> 34:06.900
...from the police to the media.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.550
It took half a day...

34:12.920 --> 34:15.510
According to the information I found in half a day...

34:15.510 --> 34:18.690
The first news to report was Dae Jeon's...

34:18.690 --> 34:21.520
Han Beat News,
Reporter Heo Ji Woo.

34:21.520 --> 34:26.639
"Bizarre Tape Incident,
Police leave empty handed, become silent"

34:26.639 --> 34:32.030
The second news to report is Seoul YTN News, Reporter Park Soo Jin.

34:32.030 --> 34:36.810
"Dae Jeon Tape Crime,
Police reveal serial killer"

34:39.159 --> 34:43.340
More important than this is...

34:43.340 --> 34:49.560
...the fact that the Director didn't have this on his wall.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.770
It's the hole. Hole!

34:51.770 --> 34:54.690
The hole that the Director could never find!

34:58.370 --> 35:00.270
But... Min Ho...

35:00.270 --> 35:04.230
Why do we need that to find F?

35:08.480 --> 35:10.230
Yeh Ri, you don't know?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.290
Yes...

35:12.290 --> 35:14.130
Yeh Ri, you really don't know?

35:17.980 --> 35:19.770
Detective Baek?

35:19.770 --> 35:21.540
This isn't important?

35:25.780 --> 35:27.650
- Min Ho?
- Yes?

35:28.940 --> 35:33.680
You worked this hard not even knowing if it's needed?

35:33.680 --> 35:35.140
Yes.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.540
Of course!

35:43.540 --> 35:46.340
You definitely have cow's reverse luck!

35:46.340 --> 35:48.900
Right! This is important, right?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.180
But who gave that tip?

35:53.180 --> 35:58.130
Well, I requested the search but they said it would take some time.

35:58.130 --> 36:01.030
That's what's important.

36:01.030 --> 36:04.070
Who gave the tip.

36:05.570 --> 36:11.120
What Director Yeo hid was the fact that F could've been close to the police.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.510
There were only 2 people in this world who knew about the serial killer.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.260
Yeo Ji Hoon and F.

36:19.260 --> 36:24.750
Then, the tip about the serial killer came from the police...

36:24.750 --> 36:27.950
There's a good chance that the tip was F himself!

36:27.950 --> 36:29.500
That's right.

36:29.500 --> 36:33.110
In the wrap case and also in the black vinyl case...

36:33.110 --> 36:38.070
...the culprit was practically showing off the body and bragging.

36:38.070 --> 36:42.320
Even this time, he alerted the media and grabbed everyone's attention.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.810
Doesn't that mean he wanted to exhibit his crime once again?

36:45.810 --> 36:49.850
Moreover, since that fact is not in the Director's collection of data...

36:49.850 --> 36:53.240
He either missed that fact or hasn't disclosed it yet.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.430
It's one of those two.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.430
It's definitely worth looking into.

37:00.250 --> 37:03.170
I told you! You're a cow!

37:05.380 --> 37:06.670
I am!

37:09.160 --> 37:10.670
They must've found something.

37:10.670 --> 37:11.770
Really?

37:12.310 --> 37:13.530
Follow me.

37:25.980 --> 37:29.050
Out of all the people the reporters talked to...

37:29.050 --> 37:31.060
...they narrowed it down to those connected with the police.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.320
- But...
- But what?

37:32.320 --> 37:35.970
There are no two names overlapping on the list.

37:37.250 --> 37:41.180
So, that could mean that the second tip was a different person.

37:44.790 --> 37:45.980
Wait.

37:47.410 --> 37:48.640
Who's this?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.150
I've seen this name before.

37:51.150 --> 37:52.490
Who?

37:53.380 --> 37:54.280
This!

37:57.680 --> 38:00.470
This is getting weird again.

38:01.420 --> 38:02.720
Nam Yeh Ri?

38:03.910 --> 38:06.630
It doesn't seem like F is hiding his identity.

38:06.630 --> 38:09.070
I told you that it seems like he's deceiving people with it.

38:12.770 --> 38:15.000
Nam Yeh Ri, I think you're going to have to come with me.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.450
- Min Ho?
- Yes?

38:16.450 --> 38:19.390
- Do what you can to find the second tip.
- Yes.

38:38.630 --> 38:41.070
Long time no see, Chief.

38:45.660 --> 38:46.980
Detective Baek!

38:48.170 --> 38:49.870
What are you doing here?

38:50.960 --> 38:55.040
I've been wanting to ask some things but it's so hard to meet up.

38:56.360 --> 39:00.940
As far as I know, everyone went back to their original job.

39:00.940 --> 39:07.020
011-765-9871.
You remember this number, right?

39:08.640 --> 39:10.940
You only changed the beginning.

39:10.940 --> 39:12.950
It's the same number you still use.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.160
That's my old number.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.650
But what about it?

39:20.490 --> 39:22.890
Why did you leak the story to the press?

39:22.890 --> 39:28.060
Why would the Investigation Director leak this secret case to the press?

39:28.060 --> 39:32.580
Then and even now,
I'm responsible for that case.

39:32.580 --> 39:33.990
One more thing.

39:33.990 --> 39:38.120
The day of Yeo Ji Hoon's fake operation on Yoo Hyun Kyung 7 years ago...

39:39.020 --> 39:40.950
Someone died, right?

39:41.750 --> 39:43.130
What were you doing on that night?

39:43.130 --> 39:45.880
Since you were the Director in charge of the operation that night,

39:45.880 --> 39:48.000
you should have been in command.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.050
Baek Do Shik...

39:53.050 --> 39:54.500
Is this fun?

39:54.500 --> 39:57.100
You're having fun playing Detective, aren't you?

39:57.100 --> 40:02.310
That's why you're playing around this late at night, huh?

40:10.120 --> 40:12.540
I didn't expect you to answer.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.780
But since this is all I've prepared for today...

40:15.780 --> 40:17.860
Why don't you head back now and we'll do the same?

40:17.860 --> 40:19.220
Don't leak info anywhere else.

40:20.230 --> 40:21.580
Let's go, Yeh Ri.

40:24.710 --> 40:26.480
But...

40:27.800 --> 40:30.330
Did you always speak that casually with me?

40:30.330 --> 40:32.330
Makes me pissed off just hearing it.

40:43.050 --> 40:44.950
He's hiding something.

40:47.260 --> 40:47.440
What did you think?

40:47.440 --> 40:49.190
Min Ho?
What did you think?

40:49.190 --> 40:49.290
Min Ho?

40:49.290 --> 40:50.380
Really?

40:51.800 --> 40:53.340
Okay, got it.

40:54.530 --> 40:57.340
The second tip was from Detective Choi Min Hee.

40:57.940 --> 41:01.640
Let's go to YTN.
We need to confirm if that's true.

41:14.490 --> 41:16.060
Detective Baek Do Shik?

41:17.640 --> 41:20.110
- Reporter Park Soo Jin?
- Yes.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.250
Have a seat.

41:27.130 --> 41:29.320
Detective Baek Do Shik.

41:31.720 --> 41:35.350
What kind of relation do I have with the Police Internal Investigation?

41:40.480 --> 41:44.740
For the sake of the matter,
I'll get right to the point.

41:44.740 --> 41:48.730
You were involved in the leakage of top secret information...

41:48.730 --> 41:52.020
...from the National Police Agency Internal Security Department.

41:52.020 --> 41:55.740
You were somehow related to the 2004 Dae Jeon Tape Murder-

41:55.740 --> 42:00.910
I've been convicted twice for protecting my sources.

42:00.910 --> 42:03.180
Looks like you're talking to the wrong person.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.350
You know Detective Choi from the Regional Investigation Unit, right?

42:07.350 --> 42:11.330
I heard you met with him often while covering the 2004 Dae Jeon Murder.

42:11.330 --> 42:13.000
Even talking on the phone.

42:18.310 --> 42:20.580
There's suspicion of an alleged bribery.

42:20.580 --> 42:23.520
If this is true, you won't get away with just disciplinary action.

42:23.520 --> 42:24.580
Of course...

42:25.880 --> 42:29.360
If you were involved, I have no choice but to arrest you for bribery.

42:35.090 --> 42:38.600
It's true that I met up with Detective Choi often.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.550
Ever since I started my job, we've always had a brother-sister relationship.

42:42.550 --> 42:45.820
But, I didn't receive that tip from Detective Choi.

42:45.820 --> 42:46.900
Reporter Park!

42:46.900 --> 42:48.370
It's true.

42:48.370 --> 42:50.450
Although I do have relations with Detective Choi...

42:50.450 --> 42:52.650
...I heard all of that by chance.

42:55.790 --> 43:00.410
I meet with Detective Choi often but there was someone else that day.

43:00.410 --> 43:04.930
<i>There was a serial killer involved with the Dae Jeon Tape Murder? </i>

43:04.930 --> 43:08.180
<i>I've never heard this case be presented in that way. </i>

43:11.870 --> 43:14.920
Was the other person who accompanied him...

43:14.920 --> 43:17.170
A police officer by any chance?

43:17.170 --> 43:18.450
Yes.

43:18.450 --> 43:20.930
Do you remember that officer's name?

43:20.930 --> 43:21.820
Yes.

43:21.820 --> 43:24.970
Only because I heard his name a lot afterwards.

43:25.930 --> 43:28.200
What's his name?
That officer?

43:41.580 --> 43:44.740
Why?
What happened?

43:44.740 --> 43:47.100
She didn't hear the tip from Choi Min Hee.

43:48.050 --> 43:51.230
She heard it accidentally from the other police who was there.

43:53.820 --> 43:55.790
That policeman's name is...

43:55.790 --> 43:57.570
Chief Jung Woo Shik?

43:59.290 --> 44:00.910
It was Yeo Ji Hoon.

44:01.540 --> 44:04.000
What?!
Yeo Ji Hoon?!

44:09.130 --> 44:12.540
Everything was going smoothly.
Why does Yeo Ji Hoon's name come out now?

44:12.540 --> 44:15.440
Choi Min Hee is Yeo Ji Hoon's senior.

44:15.440 --> 44:20.200
That means he used Choi Min Hee to leak the information to Reporter Park.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.200
Then what?

44:22.200 --> 44:26.100
He cornered the National Police Agency and leaked top secret information.

44:26.100 --> 44:28.390
Then, barged in saying that he'd solve everything.

44:28.390 --> 44:30.390
Did he make up this whole scenario?

44:30.390 --> 44:33.690
So, when they did media play for the Yoo Hyun Kyung operation...

44:33.690 --> 44:35.570
Was it Reporter Park who wrote the work?

44:35.570 --> 44:37.520
Or the great Yeo Ji Hoon?

44:37.520 --> 44:39.420
Wait a minute.

44:39.420 --> 44:44.330
So, aren't the stories from Han Beat Daily and Chief Jung the same?

44:44.330 --> 44:46.790
The media messes with the existing investigative team...

44:46.790 --> 44:48.220
And intercepting the breaking news...

44:48.220 --> 44:50.810
No... no...

44:50.810 --> 44:54.880
His face just screamed that there was something more than just that.

44:57.730 --> 45:00.260
This is getting interesting.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.510
The unsolved case that no one could ever resolve...

45:03.510 --> 45:06.620
Right when the gum-smacking Detective joins the case...

45:06.620 --> 45:11.210
The media goes crazy...
The police get nervous...

45:11.210 --> 45:13.780
It's enough to catch your attention.

45:13.780 --> 45:17.580
The victim's family, who was longing for them to catch the culprit...

45:17.580 --> 45:19.640
...was probably very hopeful.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.540
Hope?

45:21.540 --> 45:25.150
Then, what do we do?
Did you forget?

45:26.510 --> 45:28.390
That was the next case.

45:30.430 --> 45:32.290
That's right.

45:32.290 --> 45:34.290
Room 101 case.

45:35.990 --> 45:37.520
But here's the thing...

45:41.430 --> 45:44.910
This case should've been the most important to Yeo Ji Hoon.

45:46.040 --> 45:48.090
Why is this so empty?

45:59.600 --> 46:03.010
<i>Hee Joo! Hee Joo! </i>

46:13.370 --> 46:17.410
Death and the Maiden

46:31.440 --> 46:35.490
Did a bald Detective already go in?

46:35.490 --> 46:37.830
No one has gone in today.

46:37.830 --> 46:39.030
Thank you.

46:39.970 --> 46:42.730
I almost had it in for being late.

47:37.550 --> 47:39.320
Stop right there!

47:40.200 --> 47:41.930
You're here?

47:45.670 --> 47:48.160
You scared me!

47:48.160 --> 47:49.980
Detective Baek!

47:49.980 --> 47:51.880
What are you doing in here?

47:51.880 --> 47:55.170
Lower your volume.
I can't hear the music.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.230
Wait.

48:00.230 --> 48:02.370
How did you get in?

48:02.370 --> 48:04.870
They said no one came in.

48:04.870 --> 48:07.430
How I came in is not important.

48:08.510 --> 48:10.990
It's when I came in that's important.

48:12.470 --> 48:14.540
On the day of the crime,
the police put up cameras in...

48:14.540 --> 48:17.980
...the 2 exits, hallway, and even the stairs.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.620
They didn't miss an inch.

48:20.620 --> 48:24.630
The only way to get into Room 101 without getting caught by the cameras...

48:28.530 --> 48:29.980
Time delay!

48:33.550 --> 48:37.630
He was already inside with Jung Hee Joo the night before.

48:37.630 --> 48:38.840
Like me today.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.720
What-

48:40.720 --> 48:45.240
So you were here by yourself during  the 12 hours she was dead since last night?

48:47.510 --> 48:51.170
When Yoo Hyun Kyung arrived,
that's when the operation started.

48:51.170 --> 48:54.630
That day, a classical music broadcast was playing on this TV.

48:55.910 --> 48:58.630
The quiet music was playing...

48:58.630 --> 49:02.460
Jung Hee Joo's body was laying here just like this...

49:02.460 --> 49:07.200
Then, all of a sudden!The fire alarm... blackout... chaos!

49:09.110 --> 49:12.550
He just slipped away during that time...

49:21.120 --> 49:22.360
But...

49:24.500 --> 49:27.400
I understand how he didn't get caught going in.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.920
But how did he get out?

49:32.690 --> 49:35.100
Did he escape through one of the exits during the power outage?

49:36.540 --> 49:39.900
Then, he would have been caught by one of the guards outside.

49:40.530 --> 49:41.900
That's right.

49:41.900 --> 49:45.620
That's night his style.
He's a specialist in disguise.

49:48.660 --> 49:51.210
Maybe he disguised himself amongst the guests during the chaos?

49:52.500 --> 49:55.510
That or he disguised himself with the Detectives.

50:00.840 --> 50:02.770
They call this a ghost crime, right?

50:03.400 --> 50:04.480
Min Ho!

50:04.480 --> 50:09.920
Go and get alibis from everyone who was here that night.

50:10.450 --> 50:12.000
Detectives and guests!

50:12.540 --> 50:13.900
Something will come up.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.280
Yes, I got it.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.610
I need to stick around and do more ghost play.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.860
<i>Yes, who is it? </i>

50:32.410 --> 50:35.590
Is this the resident of Direct Jung Yoon Soo?

50:35.590 --> 50:38.130
I'm Detective Nam Yeh Ri,
the one who called you.

50:54.020 --> 50:56.470
Are you here for Hee Joo?

51:09.390 --> 51:12.140
It might be painful to remember...

51:13.590 --> 51:18.650
Please tell me if your remember anything from the day before her death.

51:21.890 --> 51:22.970
That day...

51:23.710 --> 51:28.320
There was a concert at the volunteer organization she regularly attended every Thursday.

51:29.110 --> 51:32.590
It was getting colder so I told her to dress warmly and she wouldn't listen.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.960
We had a small argument in the morning.

51:37.120 --> 51:40.510
I made her wear a red scarf and sent her on her way.

51:41.340 --> 51:46.060
I got a call around the evening saying she had dinner plans with Ji Hoon.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.220
And then...

51:50.400 --> 51:52.630
Was it 11 PM?

51:52.630 --> 51:54.060
I got a text.

51:55.210 --> 51:59.030
Telling me she had other plans and would be home late,

51:59.030 --> 52:00.630
and not to wait up for her.

52:03.580 --> 52:05.210
Other plans?

52:07.210 --> 52:10.280
Not a phone call but a text message?

52:10.280 --> 52:11.370
Now that I think about it...

52:12.590 --> 52:16.230
Her last message to me was to not wait for her.

52:17.110 --> 52:18.730
"Don't wait for me..."

53:05.270 --> 53:06.500
Han-eul?

53:46.570 --> 53:48.240
"Death and the Maiden"

54:29.500 --> 54:32.450
- Did you find anything?
- There's nothing.

54:32.450 --> 54:35.630
The Director has the same alibi from the day before.

54:35.630 --> 54:39.050
I looked through a week's worth of alibis already!

54:39.050 --> 54:40.340
Hey kid.

54:40.340 --> 54:43.780
Don't be so careless and make sure we didn't miss anything!

54:43.780 --> 54:47.000
<i>Are you eating something?
I can hear you chewing. </i>

54:47.000 --> 54:49.660
Jjajangmyun!

54:50.930 --> 54:55.230
I was too busy to eat anything!

54:55.230 --> 54:56.630
<i>Do you think I'm eating because I'm hungry? </i>

54:56.630 --> 54:59.030
The kids guarding the hotel are hungry.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.880
There should be something from the 1st floor guests.

55:03.670 --> 55:05.240
There was a dead body in 101.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.340
Does it make sense that there was no suspicious person there?

55:08.300 --> 55:10.830
If I find that you missed something, you're dead!

55:16.600 --> 55:19.040
1st floor, 2nd floor.
Done.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.480
2nd Floor,
Room 202, Stakeout.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.710
Room 208, Stakeout.

55:22.710 --> 55:24.850
1st floor, 2nd floor.
Guests, done.

55:25.730 --> 55:27.540
See! I did everything!

55:33.470 --> 55:35.320
Whatever. I'm going to eat.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.410
There is someone without an alibi.

55:48.920 --> 55:52.480
Viper... Viper...
One more time.

55:53.140 --> 55:55.880
Let's focus one more time.

55:55.880 --> 55:59.750
There was a blackout.
Then, the fire alarm rang.

56:00.490 --> 56:02.900
The Detectives thought something happened to Yoo Hyun Kyung.

56:02.900 --> 56:06.410
They searched the 2nd floor hallway and all the 2nd room floors.

56:06.410 --> 56:08.220
If he was a Detective...

56:08.220 --> 56:10.960
He would have hidden on the 2nd floor with everyone else.

56:12.180 --> 56:13.250
No, wait.

56:14.570 --> 56:18.890
If they were in the middle of an operation, how did he get into 101?

56:21.100 --> 56:22.880
If he's not a Detective...

56:23.950 --> 56:27.480
He would have had to hide with the guests on the 1st floor.

56:28.730 --> 56:30.730
But there were no suspects on the 1st floor...

56:36.170 --> 56:39.990
There's no way he could've escaped from 101...

56:43.750 --> 56:45.200
Another time delay!

56:47.170 --> 56:50.490
If he wasn't in 101 when the fire alarm went off...

56:51.540 --> 56:54.470
And he escaped before the security cameras were installed...

56:57.380 --> 56:58.670
Then the fire alarm...

57:17.430 --> 57:20.020
Two at both ends of every hallway.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.870
And there's a smoke alarm in every room.

57:23.690 --> 57:27.110
Running around this motel like a rat...

57:27.110 --> 57:30.710
Setting off the fire alarm was pretty easy then.

57:34.150 --> 57:35.900
I caught you.

57:35.900 --> 57:38.060
You ghost bastard!

57:38.060 --> 57:43.220
During the chaos, you weren't in 101!
You were somewhere else!

57:46.740 --> 57:51.540
We parted ways after the concert.

57:51.540 --> 57:53.510
Ji Hoon was really busy.

57:53.510 --> 57:56.630
So, she was excited that he made room to eat with her.

57:56.630 --> 58:01.420
They were supposed to prepare for study abroad together...

58:02.590 --> 58:07.450
So, she was always complaining that he was too busy for her.

58:07.450 --> 58:11.230
This volunteer organization...
What do they do there?

58:12.140 --> 58:17.110
It's a victim support group gathering run by the Catholic Church.

58:17.110 --> 58:20.470
The victims' families get together to talk and eat.

58:20.470 --> 58:22.840
We volunteered once a month so we did a service concert.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.460
It seems like Hee Joo really liked the song, "Death and the Maiden."

58:28.460 --> 58:31.150
Her room was filled with records and drawings.

58:31.850 --> 58:34.360
Schubert's "Death and a Maiden"?

58:34.360 --> 58:35.820
No.

58:35.820 --> 58:40.340
Hee Joo wasn't the one who liked the song, it was Ji Hoon.

59:01.670 --> 59:03.050
What are you doing?

59:03.660 --> 59:05.320
Wait a minute...

59:05.320 --> 59:07.780
The ghost bastard will appear any minute.

59:20.870 --> 59:24.910
The guests are running with blankets.

59:24.910 --> 59:28.120
The Detectives are holding flashlights.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.690
But you run out empty handed, huh?

59:32.840 --> 59:35.290
He came in at 8:33.

59:36.110 --> 59:38.500
Since the fire alarm went off at 8:54...

59:40.650 --> 59:45.960
What were you doing for 21 minutes with the same outfit on?

59:47.250 --> 59:48.470
And alone!

59:50.380 --> 59:53.380
If a man is at a motel on a Friday night, he's either with a girl...

59:53.380 --> 59:55.690
Or taking his clothes off to shower...

59:55.690 --> 59:59.550
If that's not it, then he's laying down watching porn.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.140
Whatever he was up to, he must've been really busy, huh?

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:10.180
3rd floor, 3rd floor, 3rd floor.

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:14.830
Room 303,
Kim Joo Suk, Min Ji Soon.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.030
Room 305, Baek Ji Min was alone.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.820
Room 308, Song Kyung Tae was alone too.

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:33.120
This floor is stranger than the other ones.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.560
Everyone please come here.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.080
Min Ho, I'm doing something really important right now.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.620
This is probably more important.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.120
What is that?

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.840
From the alibis of the people who were at the motel that night...

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.730
The one person whose alibi I never got.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:57.610
No, the person who didn't try to give an alibi...

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.790
Yeo Ji Hoon?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.430
Are you kidding with me right now?

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.070
Why do you need Yeo Ji Hoon's alibi?

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.220
I thought it was a joke at first too.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.900
But after looking into it,
it's not a joke.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:20.250
I couldn't confirm his alibi for the day before the incident.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.010
Except one thing!
The evening before the incident-

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:24.510
He met Jung Hee Joo.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.720
I confirmed it with her friends and family.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.420
You know what's more weird?

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.640
Looking through Director Yeo...

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:39.080
I mean, Regional Investigation Unit's Ace, Yeo Ji Hoon's records...

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.030
He took a lot of breaks outside of work on Fridays.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.120
Hey, Park Min Ho!

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:47.180
What are you trying to say?

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.850
That's probably because he was trying to catch F.

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:54.520
I don't know! That's what you said!

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.420
The Detective who doesn't have a good alibi is probably F!

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.570
What's this?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.270
"A Night of Classical Music?"

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:06.700
There's phone records from 5 days before the incident.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.110
It's a program where viewers can request certain classical songs.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.330
What kind of serial killer would listen to classical music?

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.020
Wait. The day of Jung Hee Joo's murder...

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.360
Wasn't there a classical music station playing on TV?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.550
Wait a minute.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.780
It's "Death and the Maiden."

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.900
The music that was playing on the day Jung Hee Joo died.

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:54.310
What about it?

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.670
That was Director Yeo's favorite song.

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:04.210
Using "Death and the Maiden" to tempt...

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:07.950
What does that mean?

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:11.110
So, the day of the murder...

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.030
No, no, no.

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:16.470
Director Yeo requested that song to play on the night of the murder?

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:17.870
Wait.

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:29.150
Camouflage.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.620
The best camouflage.

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.680
A murderer who kills people...

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.290
Disguises himself as a Detective who chases after murderers...

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:48.040
What is this?
How did you get in here?

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.950
I'm Kim Yoon Chul from the National Police Agency.

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:55.840
The three of you need to come with me.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.960
This snow is crazy!

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:44.270
Have you heard the news?

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.990
It snowed over 1m in Gangwondo.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:48.590
Snow is snow.

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.160
We have to keep on with this investigation, don't we?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.330
Detective Baek.

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:56.510
How much confidence do you have in your skills as a Detective?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.090
Have you ever been curious?

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:03.280
Why Yeo Ji Hoon would've chosen you on his Ten team?

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.510
If that was me...

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.140
I would've asked, "Why me?"

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:16.100
Okay... Detective Nam Yeh Ri.

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.830
How much do you think you know about Yeo Ji Hoon?

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.920
Do you know this?

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.530
That Yeo Ji Hoon did a background check on all the Ten members.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.460
Family background, work experience...

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.440
Even your property assets.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.640
You didn't know?

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.520
Your director...

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.140
You've heard the rumors that he killed his girlfriend, right?

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.550
What do you think?

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:50.580
When you work together,
you get a feeling!

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.960
"Oh! This guy is kind of weird."

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.500
"He must be crazy."

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:58.120
Things like that.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.990
You were aware that Yeo Ji Hoon
was the leading suspect from 7 years ago?

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.100
That guy was laughing after his girlfriend's death.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.350
Cackling like a crazy man.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.100
Ah! Yeo Ji Hoon!

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.870
I have some memories with that guy.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.320
When Jung Hee Joo was found in Room 101...

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.630
The alibi that he was conducting the Yoo Hyun Kyung operation in 202,

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.230
that's the only thing that freed him from the suspicions.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:30.590
Then we stopped the investigation right away.

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:33.720
What do you think from a Detective's perspective?

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.750
Doesn't something seem wrong?

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.550
<i>I caught you! </i>

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:41.630
<i>You ghost bastard! </i>

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.810
<i>During the chaos, you weren't in 101!
You were somewhere else! </i>

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:48.420
<i>The best camouflage. </i>

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.690
Ever since this case opened,
Yeo Ji Hoon has been gone for days.

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:01.600
No matter how busy, he isn't the type to be this irresponsible.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.510
Right?

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:08.640
As soon as the case breaks out, his alibi is unclear.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.140
Isn't that strange?

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:17.800
Hey.

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:22.380
Can't you change this to mixed coffee?

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.160
This doesn't suit my taste.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.550
Yeo Ji Hoon... this guy sure is interesting, isn't he?

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.040
Is Yeo Ji Hoon the suspect for the murder in Room 101?

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:42.780
Just like how you interrogate suspects...

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.640
It's our job to interrogate Detectives like you.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.960
Do you understand?

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.470
You aren't here to ask questions.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:53.450
You're here to answer the questions I ask.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.220
Where is he?
Yeo Ji Hoon?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.310
You guys are the ones who investigate.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.790
If you're asking for help because you're not capable,

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:12.760
then ask as a favor.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.010
Using threats...

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.220
And let's talk from a distance.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.819
Your breath smells like pizza.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:24.830
Okay then.

01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:28.710
Let's watch a movie together.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.840
What is this?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.250
This is a video taken by Kim Min Hee,
a victim from the 101 incident.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.729
Date and time, December 24, 3:46 PM.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:57.729
The day before the body was found.

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.630
You know who that is, don't you?
That person.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:38.660
Subtitles provided by CJ Entertainment

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:46.979
He could've been there to look for F!

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:49.880
He told us a big, fat lie!

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.819
Yeo Ji Hoon, you bastard.
Who are you?

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:55.730
7 years ago, Yeo Ji Hoon,
Jung Hee Joo, Kim Min Hee...

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:57.480
...were all at the same place.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.650
Detective Baek, look at this.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:02.340
Don't we know this person?

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.650
I think we finally caught F!

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:07.070
Did this person come in here?

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.370
Yes! It's him!

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeo Ji Hoon!
You son of a bitch!

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:14.070
Yeo Ji Hoon!
I'm going to kill you!

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:21.010
From now on... Yeo Ji Hoon...
is the devil.
