34:27.364 --> 34:29.719
Tomorrow, and they'll be here.

34:33.045 --> 34:36.242
Hey, hey, hello.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.123
-What did it feel like?
-Leave her alone. Go away!

34:39.205 --> 34:43.277
-They said the same thing here.
-Piss off, you perv.

34:43.364 --> 34:45.196
Yeah, okay, bye.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.081
It happened to David and Mica.

34:47.165 --> 34:49.679
What is it? What is it?

34:49.764 --> 34:52.438
I don't know. But this is what we do.
We deal with things like this.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.004
So deal with it. Stop it.

34:54.085 --> 34:56.553
-I need to find Jack. Give me that.
-How will this help?

34:56.645 --> 34:58.681
I took the number of the van
they put him in.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.756
You can track any vehicle
with the right computer programs.

35:00.845 --> 35:02.836
-Really?
-Yeah. Give me the car keys.

35:02.925 --> 35:05.439
Oh, Johnny'll do his nut!

35:05.525 --> 35:08.119
Please, we've got no time to spare.

35:09.965 --> 35:11.398
A ''thank you'' would be nice.

35:11.485 --> 35:14.397
Look, I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Thanks for all this.

35:18.605 --> 35:20.118
Be careful!

35:26.405 --> 35:27.440
LOIS: Hold the line, please.

35:27.525 --> 35:30.119
BRIDGET: Hello, I'll put you on hold,
if that's all right

35:30.205 --> 35:32.082
Mr Frobisher will be back in a moment.

35:32.165 --> 35:34.520
I'll have to put you on hold.

35:34.605 --> 35:37.961
WOMAN ON TV: <i>''We are coming tomorrow. ''</i>
<i>Repeated in total, 38 times.</i>

35:38.045 --> 35:41.276
Hello? I'm sorry. It's a bit hectic here
at the moment with the children thing...

35:41.365 --> 35:44.357
<i>And reports from all around the world</i>
<i>confirm that every single child</i>

35:44.445 --> 35:46.720
<i>said the same thing,</i>
<i>from France to South Africa.</i>

35:46.805 --> 35:48.955
Give me the name, and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

35:49.045 --> 35:50.160
Get my daughters on the phone.

35:50.245 --> 35:52.475
Ring the school office if you have to.
Drag them out of their lessons.

35:52.565 --> 35:55.477
I want to speak to them.
Then get me the Prime Minister.

35:55.565 --> 35:56.759
There's a call waiting, sir.

35:56.845 --> 35:59.882
-Take a message.
-It's the Home Secretary.

35:59.965 --> 36:02.763
-And your wife wants you to call her.
-Okay.

36:02.845 --> 36:04.995
<i>The United Nations has yet</i>
<i>to make a statement...</i>

36:05.085 --> 36:06.234
Hello, John Frobisher's office.

36:06.725 --> 36:08.317
Can I speak to Mr Frobisher, please?

36:09.005 --> 36:11.394
He's not available at the moment.
Can I take a message?

36:11.845 --> 36:13.756
It's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.

36:13.845 --> 36:16.962
<i>I need to see him urgently.</i>
<i>Can you set up a meeting?</i>

36:18.325 --> 36:21.874
Um, I'm not sure.

36:22.285 --> 36:25.083
-Just put me straight through, then.
-He's very busy.

36:25.165 --> 36:28.601
<i>-Yeah. He would be. Who is this?</i>
-Lois. Lois Habiba.

36:29.205 --> 36:30.354
What happened to Bridget Spears?

36:30.885 --> 36:32.523
She's on another line.

36:32.605 --> 36:35.165
<i>-Do you know what Torchwood is, Lois?</i>
-Yes.

36:35.245 --> 36:38.123
Then you should know that right now,
you lot need us.

36:38.205 --> 36:39.638
The whole world needs us.

36:39.725 --> 36:41.204
We can help.
But someone's trying to kill us,

36:41.285 --> 36:43.355
someone who claims to be
working for the government.

36:43.445 --> 36:45.322
Why would the government want to
kill people who can help?

36:45.405 --> 36:47.999
Yeah, exactly. That's what I have to
find out. That's why I need to see him.

36:48.085 --> 36:50.645
Look, I know all this sounds mad.
You have to believe me.

36:50.725 --> 36:53.603
I do. I do believe you.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.843
Hold the line, please.

36:55.925 --> 36:59.759
Call my wife, I'm in a meeting
with the PM. I'll ring as soon as I can.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.563
-I'm putting the school through.
-Ah.

37:02.285 --> 37:04.435
-If you're tracing this call...
<i>-I'm not.</i>

37:05.765 --> 37:07.164
So you can set up a meeting, then?

37:07.845 --> 37:11.838
Lilly, is Holly there?
They're both all right.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.637
-You're sure?
-Yes.

37:18.125 --> 37:20.400
The Prime Minister's on his way.
He'll be there in 1 0 minutes.

37:20.485 --> 37:22.680
Okay, thanks. Ring ahead.
Let them know we're coming.

37:22.765 --> 37:26.155
-Right.
-Simon, I'm going back to Thames House.

37:39.805 --> 37:42.638
-Can you trust this guy?
-He's our man in the government.

37:42.725 --> 37:44.681
If we can't, we really are in trouble.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.483
Gwen, we really are in trouble.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.362
Yeah, we've got to
trust someone, Rhys, okay?

38:00.445 --> 38:03.994
-Hi. I'm Lois.
-Where's Frobisher?

38:06.045 --> 38:08.354
-He's not coming.
-Why not?

38:08.445 --> 38:11.881
My God, this is probably
the worst mistake of my life.

38:13.205 --> 38:15.594
I've read your files.

38:15.685 --> 38:17.915
Some of the stuff you've done,
you're like unsung national heroes.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.314
Listen, I don't do autographs
and I don't want to be rude.

38:20.405 --> 38:23.715
But why am I taking to you
and not your boss?

38:23.805 --> 38:26.877
Because if he knew you were here,
you'd be dead.

38:30.205 --> 38:32.639
He gave the order to have
Jack Harkness killed.

38:34.925 --> 38:36.836
You sure?

38:36.925 --> 38:39.280
I've seen it with my own eyes.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.723
We really are in trouble.

38:42.805 --> 38:45.524
-Do you know a Captain Andrew Staines?
-No.

38:45.605 --> 38:48.165
-A Colonel Michael Sanders? Ellen Hunt?
-No.

38:51.365 --> 38:53.083
They're all dead.

38:53.965 --> 38:57.355
They were killed on the same day
as Jack Harkness.

38:57.445 --> 39:00.721
I didn't sign the Official Secrets Act
to cover up murder.

39:01.925 --> 39:06.077
But then, I didn't take the job
to commit treason on my second day.

39:06.165 --> 39:08.998
-What am I doing here?
-You tell me, Lois.

39:10.045 --> 39:13.515
If you're the bad guys,
why doesn't it say that on your file?

39:13.605 --> 39:17.234
And if you're the good guys,
who am I working for?

39:17.325 --> 39:18.883
And why do they want you dead?

39:18.965 --> 39:22.401
Listen, this is a lot to talk about.

39:23.725 --> 39:26.364
And we're going to arouse suspicion.

39:26.445 --> 39:28.515
And we haven't ordered.

39:30.165 --> 39:33.635
When we went on the run,
we didn't have any money, see.

39:35.325 --> 39:38.635
And we put the last of the coins
in the phone box to get through to you.

39:38.725 --> 39:40.761
So, is there any chance you could...

39:45.125 --> 39:46.638
Thank you.

39:46.725 --> 39:49.193
Oh, great. Thanks. That's magic.

39:49.285 --> 39:51.480
I'll have a steak pie
and chips and a cup of tea.

39:51.605 --> 39:53.357
-Yeah.
-Just a latte for me.

39:53.445 --> 39:56.403
Okay. Won't be a second.
I'll leave you to it.

39:58.565 --> 40:01.204
Thanks, we owe you one, a big one.

40:01.285 --> 40:03.924
Everyone in the office seems to think
what's happening with the kids

40:04.005 --> 40:06.394
is all to do with aliens.

40:06.485 --> 40:08.760
And that they'll be here tomorrow.

40:08.845 --> 40:11.518
And there's something big being built
on the top floor of the MI5 building.

40:11.605 --> 40:14.563
-Okay, what do you mean ''something''?
-I don't know.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.237
But it's like they're getting ready.

40:16.325 --> 40:20.716
And if you lot, Torchwood,
if you're the alien experts,

40:20.805 --> 40:23.797
and they really are coming tomorrow,

40:23.885 --> 40:27.082
why does Mr Frobisher want you
out of the way all of a sudden?

40:27.165 --> 40:29.963
I've no idea, but I'm going to find out.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.723
Can you tell me anything about
Jack Harkness or Ianto Jones?

40:33.805 --> 40:35.477
Jones is missing.

40:36.445 --> 40:38.800
I've been told Captain Harkness is dead.

40:38.885 --> 40:41.240
-Well, that can't be true.
-Well, that's what I thought.

40:41.325 --> 40:44.317
I overheard Mr Frobisher say
to keep him under surveillance.

40:44.405 --> 40:47.078
I mean, why do that to a dead person?

40:48.485 --> 40:50.635
(JACK SHOUTING)

40:51.005 --> 40:54.520
JACK: Come on! Who's the genius
behind the camera?

40:55.685 --> 40:58.245
<i>Come on, come on, take your bow.</i>

40:58.325 --> 41:01.237
Show yourself. Face me like a man!

41:09.765 --> 41:11.483
I'm not a man.

41:12.965 --> 41:14.444
Who are you?

41:15.885 --> 41:16.954
What's all this about?

41:17.045 --> 41:21.436
Apparently you can't die. So it would be
foolish to tell you anything.

41:21.565 --> 41:24.363
But I will say this,
if I can't kill you,

41:25.365 --> 41:27.117
I can contain you.

41:42.485 --> 41:44.874
(SCREAMING)

41:52.725 --> 41:55.034
JACK: Nooo!

41:59.245 --> 42:01.281
GWEN: <i>Do you know</i>
<i>where they're keeping him?</i>

42:01.365 --> 42:03.799
I've got a floor plan in my bag.

42:07.165 --> 42:11.716
-Steak pie and chips twice?
-Oh, thank you.

42:11.805 --> 42:15.764
It's a... It's a military compound.

42:15.845 --> 42:17.039
Are you sure?

42:17.125 --> 42:19.320
That's where Mr Frobisher
told them to take him.

42:19.405 --> 42:20.599
-Salt?
-Thanks.

42:20.685 --> 42:23.119
This is brilliant work, Lois.

42:23.205 --> 42:24.923
Can you... Oh.

42:25.005 --> 42:26.324
Only problem is, how do we get inside?

42:26.405 --> 42:27.599
Well, um,

42:27.685 --> 42:31.803
Mr Frobisher's just authorised
the release of a body from Ashton Down.

42:31.885 --> 42:35.434
This is Rupesh Patanjali.

42:35.525 --> 42:37.595
They must have thought he was one of us.

42:37.685 --> 42:39.676
Well, the undertaker's name is
Richard Rossiter,

42:39.765 --> 42:42.438
and he's got an appointment
to pick him up at 5:30 today.

42:42.525 --> 42:44.914
And I was thinking,
access to a funeral director

42:45.005 --> 42:47.565
would be easier than access
to a secure military compound.

42:47.645 --> 42:51.399
So, he'd have to pass through here
sometime between

42:51.485 --> 42:54.636
5:00 and 5:1 5 to get to Ashton Down
for 5:30.

42:54.725 --> 42:56.556
And there'd be no witnesses.

42:56.645 --> 43:00.081
The name of the contact at the compound
is a Corporal Camara.

43:00.165 --> 43:03.714
His number's on there
and he'll be expecting you. Sugar?

43:08.645 --> 43:10.795
I'm a PA, it's what I do.

43:11.925 --> 43:15.361
When this is all over
and you want a job, come see me.

43:27.965 --> 43:29.444
I'm sorry.

43:30.605 --> 43:32.721
I don't suppose you'd believe it,

43:32.805 --> 43:35.638
but this is all
in the national interest.

-We're ready?

44:17.285 --> 44:18.684
Let's go.

44:20.405 --> 44:22.714
Have they sent us
any further information?

44:22.805 --> 44:26.036
Not since they sent us the designs
for this thing.

44:33.045 --> 44:35.275
I've got two radio operators
working round the clock.

44:35.365 --> 44:38.118
They're sending out continuous messages
on the 456 wavelength,

44:38.205 --> 44:39.433
but we're getting nothing back.

44:39.525 --> 44:42.085
Carry on, don't mind me.
What's the latest from Jodrell Bank?

44:42.165 --> 44:46.317
-Any signs of their approach?
-No, but then there wasn't last time.

44:51.325 --> 44:52.917
What's that for?

44:56.445 --> 44:58.037
It's for them.

45:26.125 --> 45:29.356
Uh, hi. Um, we're here
to pick up a body.

45:29.445 --> 45:32.437

45:32.525 --> 45:35.358
Kodak's dead?
When did that happen?

45:36.245 --> 45:40.397
No, he's the contact.
The name of the deceased is Patanjali.

45:40.925 --> 45:43.393
-Rupesh Patanjali.
-Jesus!

45:43.525 --> 45:46.756
Shit meself, then. He owes me money.

45:47.365 --> 45:49.515
-I'm sorry.
-I'll have to look in the back.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.803
Kodak, got a couple of body snatchers
down at the gate for you.

46:00.885 --> 46:04.400
<i>-Over.</i>
-Okay, let them in. Over.

get away with this.

46:29.765 --> 46:31.403
You really shouldn't be here, Rhys.

46:31.485 --> 46:33.203
Oh, I shouldn't? Hello?

46:34.405 --> 46:37.124
If Jack needs carrying,
you're gonna need me here.

46:53.445 --> 46:56.005
See that fire exit?
Do you want to back up to that?

46:56.085 --> 46:58.041
Save you having to

Not usually.
But we've got in three at the moment.

47:25.005 --> 47:28.395
-Do I know you?
-No, I don't think so.

47:32.805 --> 47:35.000
You don't look like an undertaker.

47:35.085 --> 47:36.882
If more undertakers looked like you,

47:36.965 --> 47:39.763
there'd be more of a demand
for bereavement.

49:41.125 --> 49:43.685
Move it, Rhys, out of the way.

49:48.005 --> 49:49.961
What the hell is that?

49:51.605 --> 49:53.880
Move! Move! Move! Positions!

50:02.005 --> 50:03.916
We have to surrender.

50:09.085 --> 50:11.440
I'd lay down your weapons if I were you.

50:11.525 --> 50:15.598
You're as trapped and helpless
as the man in the concrete cell.

50:18.365 --> 50:20.196
Put the guns down!

50:27.685 --> 50:28.879
Okay.

50:37.725 --> 50:39.317
(ALL CLAMOURING)

50:43.645 --> 50:46.796
-Run, run!
-Positions, positions, come on!

50:46.885 --> 50:49.035
Come on, get on.

50:49.125 --> 50:51.400
Ah, Ianto. You took your time.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.558
The roof's collapsing. Come on!

51:01.365 --> 51:02.957
-Go!
-Move it!

51:03.045 --> 51:04.842
Take your positions.

51:07.645 --> 51:09.601
Go after them, all of you!

51:10.525 --> 51:14.313
-They're gonna catch up.
-Rhys, get out and move that truck.

51:16.645 --> 51:18.158
Hold on tight.

51:32.805 --> 51:34.204
Move, Rhys!

51:39.965 --> 51:41.364
Come on!

51:53.085 --> 51:54.643
We've got a problem.

51:54.725 --> 51:56.841
Cooper and Jones stalled us
at a roadblock.

51:56.925 --> 51:58.040
How did that happen?

51:58.125 --> 52:01.640
I'm sorry, there's a chopper on the way.
But they've got a head start on us now.

52:01.725 --> 52:04.159
If he talks we're in deep, deep shit.

52:04.245 --> 52:06.042
<i>I'll have to call you back.</i>

52:09.245 --> 52:12.396
RHYS: Where the hell
are you taking us, Ianto?

52:18.485 --> 52:19.634
What are we doing?

52:19.725 --> 52:21.636
You'll see in a moment.
Get the car started.

52:21.725 --> 52:24.364
We've only got a few minutes, come on.

52:32.805 --> 52:34.636
Come on, come on.

53:29.565 --> 53:31.362
(GASPING)

53:50.725 --> 53:54.081
-Told you I'd be back.
-With a little help from us.

53:54.165 --> 53:56.395
-What the hell's going on?
-Don't know yet.

53:56.485 --> 53:59.158
But the latest from the kids is
that it's happening tomorrow.

53:59.245 --> 54:00.234
Just in time, then.

54:00.325 --> 54:03.397
Get in the car.
Come on, we've got work to do.

54:16.045 --> 54:19.560
REPORTER: <i>The United Nations has issued</i>
<i>a statement asking parents...</i>

54:19.645 --> 54:21.715
REPORTER 2: <i>The question still remains</i>
<i>why every child in the world</i>

54:21.805 --> 54:24.319
<i>is giving their statements</i>
<i>in the English language.</i>

54:24.405 --> 54:28.159
REPORTER: <i>...no theories as to why</i>
<i>or how the children...</i>

54:28.245 --> 54:30.759
REPORTER 3: <i>Our focus now,</i>
<i>is on tomorrow.</i>

54:30.845 --> 54:34.315
<i>With every child in the world claiming</i>
<i>that tomorrow is the day,</i>

54:34.405 --> 54:37.158
<i>the world is left wondering.</i>

54:43.805 --> 54:45.523
Mr Frobisher, sir.

54:47.085 --> 54:50.157
Seals locked and...

54:51.685 --> 54:53.357
-release.
-Sir.

55:03.365 --> 55:06.277
As per the 456 instructions.

55:06.365 --> 55:10.244
A combination of 25percent  nitrosyl chloride,

55:10.325 --> 55:15.524
22percent  hydrogen chloride, 20percent  nitrogen,
1 2percent  fluorine,

55:15.605 --> 55:20.440
9percent  hydrogen cyanide,
6percent  acetone, 6percent  phosgene.

55:21.685 --> 55:25.280
In short, poison.

55:26.725 --> 55:29.000
I'd hold onto your nose, Bridget.

55:30.325 --> 55:32.475
Though come to think of it,
you've been doing that for years.

55:32.565 --> 55:36.558
-And that's what they breathe?
-Breathe? Eat? Fart?

55:37.605 --> 55:41.200
-(CHUCKLES) We know nothing about them.
-Excuse me.

55:41.285 --> 55:43.480
If we know the composition of that gas,

55:43.565 --> 55:46.602
can't we work out what sort of creature
could live inside it?

55:46.685 --> 55:49.438
Could do.
If we had all the time in the world.

55:49.525 --> 55:52.597
So they arrive, and then what?

55:53.805 --> 55:56.717
The whole room's laid out
according to 456 instructions.

55:58.005 --> 56:01.156
Something of
an ambassadorial suite, I'd say.

56:01.245 --> 56:04.123
Or a throne room. Who knows?

56:04.845 --> 56:06.597
Maybe a slaughterhouse.

56:08.885 --> 56:11.524
But if they arrive tomorrow, then how?

56:11.605 --> 56:14.677
How do they arrive inside that?

56:14.765 --> 56:17.154
No idea.

56:17.245 --> 56:19.679
Who else knows about this?

56:19.765 --> 56:20.834
Well, for all we know,

56:20.925 --> 56:23.393
they've sent the same instructions
to every country in the world.

56:23.485 --> 56:24.918
We've said nothing.

56:25.005 --> 56:26.961
Maybe everyone else
is keeping quiet, too.

56:27.045 --> 56:30.799
Oh, I don't think so. Whoever they are,
they're coming for Britain.

56:30.885 --> 56:32.477
-But why?
-Exactly.

56:33.885 --> 56:36.319
Why is that, Mr Frobisher?

57:15.005 --> 57:19.123
John Frobisher's a good man.
And better than that, he's expendable.

57:20.285 --> 57:22.879
If anybody finds out what I'm doing,
it's treason.

57:23.005 --> 57:24.563
You're the only friend
we've got left, Lois.

57:24.645 --> 57:26.317
CHILDREN: <i>We are coming.</i>

57:26.405 --> 57:27.679
<i>We are coming.</i>

57:27.765 --> 57:29.517
It's them, it's all of them. The kids.

57:29.645 --> 57:31.601
CHILDREN: <i>We are here.</i>
