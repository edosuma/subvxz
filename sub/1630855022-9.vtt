WEBVTT

00:51.176 --> 00:54.263
Hey, Mr. Johnson. Are you still open?

00:57.975 --> 01:01.645
You're the kid that tried to crack open
the machine with a screwdriver.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.232
Yeah, I'm Xander.
I didn't know if you'd remember me.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.317
I got "Gum" from the MORPHO.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.572
And you took my photo, but then
you never put it on your wall.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.576
Sweet sword, Mr. Johnson.

01:17.995 --> 01:18.996
Yeah.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.789
I bought it off Giorgio,

01:20.789 --> 01:25.127
thinking I could maybe use it
to saw people in half, but...

01:25.711 --> 01:28.005
Right.
You had your big magic show tonight.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.883
Sorry.
I wanted to come, but I was working.

01:30.883 --> 01:34.178
Well, you didn't miss much.
Most of my tricks didn't work.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.974
I'm starting to think
I might not be a magician after all.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.435
Maybe this will cheer you up.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.649
The antenna was busted when I found it,

01:47.649 --> 01:49.610
but I figured out how to fix it.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.613
You know what I used?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.282
Gum.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.163
You thought this would cheer me up?

02:01.997 --> 02:04.750
Well, I thought you might want it,
to go with the other one.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.710
- The other what?
- The other machine.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.258
- What makes you think this goes with that?
- Look inside.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.174
What are you thinking about?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.219
Are you thinking about
how your mother betrayed you

02:57.219 --> 02:59.054
and tried to turn the whole town
against you?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.515
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.394
Yeah, that's what I thought
you might be thinking about.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.565
- What are you thinking about?
- I'm thinking about that too, yeah.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.444
And just feeling utterly enraged
on your behalf.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.991
See, I think after this,
I'm gonna have to cut your mother off.

03:18.991 --> 03:23.203
Not have her around for dinner
or talk to her at all anymore, maybe.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.788
You'd do that for me?

03:24.788 --> 03:28.792
It would be a great sacrifice
but I'd be willing to try.

03:28.792 --> 03:33.130
I've also been thinking about
this minor revelation that I had tonight.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.552
When Mr. Johnson had me up on stage

03:38.552 --> 03:42.806
and was making me remember what
it felt like to be skiing at Whistler,

03:42.806 --> 03:45.184
it was like something shifted inside me.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.229
So? What does that mean?

03:50.272 --> 03:51.815
You wanna go back to Whistler?

03:51.815 --> 03:54.193
No. I don't know what it means.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.531
What did it mean to you
when you got "Royalty"?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.325
You wanna ask me now?

04:01.325 --> 04:03.452
I am. I'm asking you now,

04:03.452 --> 04:06.663
which I know is very late,
but I do wanna know.

04:08.999 --> 04:15.297
I think I just felt like
I had some value or something.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.341
You didn't feel like you had any value?

04:18.634 --> 04:20.427
No. No, I did.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.515
Something shifted in me too,

04:25.974 --> 04:31.188
and I felt like maybe it was okay
to wanna be...

04:32.898 --> 04:33.899
seen.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.694
It's-- That's pathetic, but--

04:37.694 --> 04:39.530
No. No, that's not pathetic.

04:40.614 --> 04:45.035
It's not. Hey, you wanna talk pathetic?
Let's talk about Giorgio, huh?

04:45.035 --> 04:48.705
Swanning around in his big wig
like a porno John Travolta,

04:48.705 --> 04:50.624
stuffing God-knows-what
down his underpants.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.292
Wait. Giorgio wears a wig?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.503
Yes! I've been dying to tell you

04:54.503 --> 04:57.214
but so much other stuff
has been happening.

04:57.214 --> 05:01.343
Just FYI, I still sleep next door.
You guys literally couldn't be any louder.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.469
Sorry, sweetie. We'll shut up.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.513
Yeah,
we were just talking revelations, honey.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.265
Is your revelation that it's 2:00 a.m.?

05:06.849 --> 05:08.934
No. No, I was just saying to your mom

05:08.934 --> 05:13.355
that maybe everything is
not quite as it seems.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.440
Yeah, that's deep.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.403
You know what? Yeah, I changed my mind.
I'm actually glad you woke me up for this.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.613
No. Listen, listen. What I'm saying is,

05:21.613 --> 05:24.825
what if "Teacher/Whistler"
doesn't really mean "Teacher/Whistler"?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.453
Just like "Royalty"
doesn't literally mean "Royalty."

05:28.453 --> 05:30.664
Maybe "Potter"
doesn't literally mean "Potter."

05:30.664 --> 05:34.751
I didn't get "Potter." I got "Liar,"
which I'm assuming had to do with the fact

05:34.751 --> 05:37.254
that I was cheating on Kolton
with his twin brother before he died

05:37.254 --> 05:40.174
and lying to him about it
and lying to everyone about it,

05:40.174 --> 05:43.594
and I've been seeing Jacob and lying
to everyone about that ever since.

05:43.594 --> 05:48.849
But if you have a different interpretation
of what "Liar" could mean,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.601
I would love to hear it.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.524
I would have to have a think about that.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.817
Oh, my God.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.029
Trina, I'm so sorry.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.031
Why are you sorry?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.158
Because--

06:06.158 --> 06:09.328
I'm sorry that you felt like you couldn't
come and talk to us about this.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.081
I just feel like, "Oh, fuck.
We really dropped the ball on this."

06:14.124 --> 06:18.045
It's okay. I'm, like, fine.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.388
You know,
I don't know if now is the right time,

06:28.388 --> 06:32.643
but I've always thought that Jacob
was a better fit for you, as it happens.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.188
I'd say that
now's not the right time to say that.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.397
I would agree.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.196
"This is a new day in Deerfield,"
Mayor Izzy proclaimed

06:44.196 --> 06:47.407
while fixing my gaze with a roguish smile.

06:47.407 --> 06:52.037
I took another sip of my ashwagandha tea
as I waited for her to continue.

06:52.037 --> 06:56.542
"Apparently," she sputtered,
"the silent majority of MORPHO Mistrusters

06:56.542 --> 06:58.877
has called for a return to normalcy..."

06:58.877 --> 07:00.295
Nobody is calling for that.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.756
"...which is why she feels
she has no other choice

07:02.756 --> 07:04.675
but to continue on as mayor

07:04.675 --> 07:08.136
and proceed with preparations
for this year's Deerfest.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.931
Natalie Pearl, <i>Deerfield Digest</i>."

07:12.683 --> 07:14.226
- Yeah, but...
- Thank you.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.437
...I would rather eat Giorgio's wig
than attend this year's Deerfest.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.232
And you can print that as my response.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.860
Okay, I don't know if you're joking,
but if Giorgio has a wig,

07:22.860 --> 07:25.362
I will print that
because that's a huge story.

07:25.362 --> 07:29.157
And secondly, yes,
you will go to Deerfest. We always go.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.993
I can't go anywhere
without people looking at me

07:30.993 --> 07:32.911
like I'm some kind of fraud
or scam artist,

07:32.911 --> 07:36.498
and I refuse
to let Izzy rub that in my face.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.333
Well, you know she's going to, right?

07:39.001 --> 07:41.128
Most people still believe in the machine,
and they know

07:41.128 --> 07:42.379
you had nothing to do with it.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.173
Excuse me. Cass?

07:44.173 --> 07:47.050
I heard that you're giving people
money back for their sweatshirts.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.094
Yes, Sheila.
Anything that is MORPHO-related

07:49.094 --> 07:51.054
that people wanna give back, they--

07:51.054 --> 07:52.890
Are you taking that off right now?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.100
- Do you have something on under there?
- No.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.560
So, what is the play here?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.854
Also, I don't think
that's one of your sweatshirts.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.440
The letters are all wrong,
and they're peeling.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.860
Yeah, and I don't even think
you got "Rockstar," Sheila.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.738
You were painting rocks
way before the machine arrived.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.450
Okay, Sheila,
let my friends enjoy their dinner.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.077
- Sheila! What the--
- Bye, Sheila.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.664
Can I take the opportunity,
with all of you here,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.583
just to say sorry again

08:19.583 --> 08:22.878
about trying to win Cass's heart
and break up your <i>famiglia</i>?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.505
- Yeah, you can.
- We've talked about it.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.216
- Wait a minute. What happened?
- I was in a really weird place.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.967
Yeah, you were on a gondola
trying to fuck my mom.

08:28.967 --> 08:34.181
But I think I'm finally almost ready
to open my heart up to new adventures.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.142
That's not as conclusive
as I'd like it to be.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.645
I've been getting a lot of guidance
from someone

08:39.645 --> 08:41.563
that I would love
for you to meet, actually.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.482
Cary. Cary, get over here.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.442
<i>Buona sera</i>, everyone.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.611
- Grandpa!
- Hello, Dad.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.655
That's right, D.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.699
- I almost forgot Cary's also your dad.
- Did you?

08:52.699 --> 08:55.452
Ever since we collabed on that video
for Cass's fundraiser,

08:55.452 --> 08:57.871
I've been having Care Bear over here
model some of my merch

08:57.871 --> 08:59.331
with his insanely jacked body.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.750
Giorgio, come on. I'm not insanely jacked.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.086
I just move a little weight around,
that's all.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.130
Nah, you've been moving me
with your wisdom of life, Mr. C.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.549
That's not his name.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.052
I guess you could say that Big C
has become a bit of a male model for me

09:12.052 --> 09:14.179
in my life in more ways than one.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.849
Male model? Dad,
that's kind of like you and "Whistler."

09:16.849 --> 09:19.476
See? Like, they mean different things.

09:20.269 --> 09:24.857
Okay. So, what pearls of wisdom
have you shared with our Giorgio, Dad?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.652
Well, nothing
I haven't tried to instill in our Dust.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.572
Face your fear.
Don't dwell in the "what-ifs."

09:31.572 --> 09:34.908
You know, "What if people laugh at me
for trying to be a male model at my age?"

09:34.908 --> 09:36.869
"What if I lose my accounting firm?"

09:36.869 --> 09:40.539
Or, "What if my wife meets another man
in Europe and never comes back?"

09:41.290 --> 09:42.875
"What if the whole town hates me?"

09:42.875 --> 09:44.293
Yeah. You gotta face your fear.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.754
Otherwise, you'll never know
what's on the other side of it.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.593
<i>Good morning, Deerfield Hooves.</i>

09:52.593 --> 09:55.596
<i>This is Axel the "Meteorologist"
with your daily weather report.</i>

09:55.596 --> 09:57.389
<i>I know some of you
might not pay attention to this,</i>

09:57.389 --> 09:59.641
<i>depending on how you feel about
the whole MORPHO controversy.</i>

09:59.641 --> 10:00.851
<i>But for those of you who do,</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:02.978
<i>there's a cold front
coming in from the northwest.</i>

10:02.978 --> 10:06.315
<i>High pressure mixing with warm winds
from the east means a storm's coming.</i>

10:06.315 --> 10:07.566
A serious storm,

10:07.566 --> 10:10.027
which could really put a damper
on the opening of Deerfest tonight,

10:10.027 --> 10:11.653
so make sure you pack your umbrellas.
Make--

10:11.653 --> 10:12.946
What are you doing?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.198
Jacob and I are dating.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.784
We've been dating for a really long time,
even before Kolton died and ever since.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.787
<i>I mean, we did break up for a bit,
and now we're back together.</i>

10:20.787 --> 10:23.582
But the point is that we're dating,
and we don't wanna keep it a secret.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.418
What the hell is going on in here?
You just can't jump on the PA!

10:26.418 --> 10:29.630
I know, and I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to do something really brave.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.215
I'm facing my fear.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.637
Okay. Well, get on with it, then.

10:40.474 --> 10:44.102
This is Trina, by the way. Trina Hubbard.

10:45.938 --> 10:49.691
I probably should've said that before,
and it's okay if you all hate me now.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.611
<i>Although, I'd really be much happier
if you didn't hate Jacob</i>

10:52.611 --> 10:54.112
<i>because he's a very good boy.</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:57.407
<i>And the only person
we really owe an apology to is Kolton,</i>

10:58.158 --> 10:59.493
<i>but he's not here,</i>

11:00.494 --> 11:01.912
which means he can't hate us

11:02.829 --> 11:06.250
and hate us less over time
and then forgive us, hopefully,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.252
which really fucking sucks,

11:08.252 --> 11:11.547
because I don't want to be a "Liar"
forever.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.063
Also, there is a meeting
of the junior jazz band after school

11:28.063 --> 11:29.481
<i>in Room 206.</i>

11:29.481 --> 11:32.860
<i>According to this piece of paper,
they are performing at Deerfest tonight</i>

11:32.860 --> 11:35.487
<i>in the arts-and-crafts tent,
so check 'em out.</i>

11:38.448 --> 11:40.075
Yeah, some hero, man.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.368
I never said I was a hero.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.996
You should've said something.
You knew that I liked you.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.540
And you made me feel like
there was something wrong with me.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.876
Yeah, because this is about you, Savannah.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.170
I can't believe Trina would do this.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.796
She's such a skanky little bitch.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.382
Hey, maybe you're the skanky little bia--

11:55.883 --> 11:57.634
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

11:57.634 --> 12:01.138
That was a mistake, and that's okay.
We are allowed to make mistakes.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.475
Trina and Jacob just made a mistake,
and they are owning that mistake, so...

12:05.475 --> 12:06.935
She's owning it.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.938
Sorry?

12:10.439 --> 12:11.440
Thanks for the heads-up.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.942
It would have been really awesome
to have talked about this earlier.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.652
We did talk about it.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.488
We agreed
that it sucked not being together.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.201
First you told me not to say anything.
Then you went and told my dad first.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.328
Then you told your parents.
Now you've told the entire school.

12:24.328 --> 12:28.373
And it's just-- It's always on your terms,
and I have no part in it at all.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.541
That's not true.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.919
He was my brother, you know.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.630
- I know that.
- I'm sorry. You told Jacob's dad first?

12:34.630 --> 12:35.714
I didn't mean to.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.882
It just kind of came out

12:36.882 --> 12:40.594
that night that you and Mom were
at the cruise thing having your threesome.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.389
Hold on. We weren't--
No, it wasn't a threesome.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.143
No-- We were
on a normal, romantic, marital getaway

12:48.143 --> 12:49.937
until some bodily mishaps

12:49.937 --> 12:52.356
and some emotional surprises
got in the way.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.441
I told you
it would spice up your marriage.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.818
- You use the coupon?
- Course I used the coupon.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.571
But I don't think any of that is
appropriate in front of the students.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.281
Well, your daughter started this.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.244
Yeah. I'm really surprised
that you told Beau before me.

13:05.244 --> 13:08.705
And, Jacob, it feels like we had bonded,
you know?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.416
- Could've mentioned it then when we were--
- Smoking weed?

13:11.416 --> 13:15.045
When we were talking about relationships
at the store that time,

13:15.045 --> 13:17.256
which I now realize was me
giving you advice

13:17.256 --> 13:19.049
about how to get with my own daughter.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.467
You were smoking weed with a student?

13:22.678 --> 13:24.805
People make mistakes.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.558
It's called being human.

13:27.558 --> 13:31.478
We need to make mistakes,
especially when we're young.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.939
I'm not just saying this.
This isn't a lecture.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.860
If there was one thing
that I could say to you as your dad,

13:38.443 --> 13:42.573
and to all of you as your "Teacher,"
it would be this:

13:42.573 --> 13:44.867
don't be afraid to make mistakes.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.412
Look at all the fully-grown people
out there who have suddenly,

13:48.412 --> 13:49.538
because of a machine,

13:49.538 --> 13:52.124
decided that they don't like what they do
for a living,

13:52.124 --> 13:57.337
or they don't like their garage
or their partner or themselves.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.007
You know what?
I wish I had made more mistakes.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.926
Wish I'd taken bigger swings.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.053
I don't know what the MORPHO means,

14:05.053 --> 14:08.390
but I do know
that it has made a lot of people realize

14:08.390 --> 14:12.769
that they want change
and that they can still change.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.565
And once you see the potential of that,
there's no going back.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.360
Well, I know I don't wanna go back.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.655
I mean, I wouldn't get much trade-in value
on my Harley,

14:23.655 --> 14:25.407
especially after the accident.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.911
And I don't wanna think I wasn't meant
to be with Farid.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.079
But I have a neighbor

14:31.079 --> 14:34.124
who's been practicing the bow and arrow
for a month,

14:34.124 --> 14:37.294
and she shot an arrow clean
through her husband's shoulder.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.420
She all right.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.925
But now she doesn't know if it means
her potential isn't really "Archer,"

14:43.592 --> 14:45.302
or if she's just in her head about it.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.386
That's it.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.351
That's it! Yes, sir!

14:52.351 --> 14:53.852
Oh, my God.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.854
- That's so clear now.
- Is everything okay in here?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.814
Yeah, he's just having another revelation.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.527
I've been trying to think of the word
for it, and that's it.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.571
The thing that's written on the card,
your "life potential."

15:05.155 --> 15:07.157
That's not the job you're meant to have,

15:07.157 --> 15:09.952
or the destiny, or your goals,
or whatever.

15:09.952 --> 15:14.665
It's not the end of the road.
It's a turn. It's an arrow.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.043
It's a thing you need to be told
about yourself

15:18.043 --> 15:19.628
to point you in the right direction.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.591
Sweetheart, you needed to be told
that you could be a "Liar"

15:24.591 --> 15:26.218
in order to tell the truth.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.973
And Jacob, who is filled
with this constant anxiety

15:30.973 --> 15:34.142
because he thinks he can't live up
to the reputation of his "Hero" brother,

15:34.142 --> 15:37.145
is then given a card
that says he, too, can be a "Hero,"

15:37.145 --> 15:38.939
and he has to confront that.

15:41.525 --> 15:46.446
And Axel,
you got "Meteorologist" in order to...

15:47.739 --> 15:51.618
I don't know. Maybe it was just
to help you believe in yourself,

15:52.494 --> 15:53.704
which is exactly what your mom said

15:53.704 --> 15:55.789
on the first night
that we ever talked about this.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.418
Or maybe you're gonna be really good
at predicting storms. I don't know.

16:00.169 --> 16:03.463
But what I do know is that we have been
asking the wrong questions.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.008
We've been asking
where the MORPHO came from,

16:06.008 --> 16:08.010
and what's inside it,
and how does it work.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.680
But what we should have been asking is,
"What's inside of us? How do we work?

16:11.680 --> 16:14.433
And why, of all places in this big world,

16:14.433 --> 16:17.352
did the MORPHO machine come
to fucking Deerfield?"

16:17.352 --> 16:18.437
That's what I wanna know.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.522
I'm proud of you.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.613
I have not even started this lesson.
Do you mind?

16:27.613 --> 16:29.865
- Okay. You got that.
- I'm sorry.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.327
For a guy who knows jack shit
about basketball

16:33.327 --> 16:36.205
and is a mediocre boxer at best,

16:36.705 --> 16:38.874
it sounds like
Dusty's not a terrible teacher.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.375
He made some interesting points.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.837
Did he actually say the thing
about people changing their garages?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.923
Because that feels like
it was directed at me specifically.

16:45.923 --> 16:47.090
It definitely was.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.221
Well, I don't care.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.056
I like this saloon.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.392
I like it too.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.353
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:59.937 --> 17:02.564
For a while, I thought nothing
would ever make you happy again.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.483
Also, I like how you can close the door

17:05.483 --> 17:08.487
and kind of imagine
that you're somewhere else.

17:09.738 --> 17:13.450
We can go somewhere else if you want.
Have you thought of that?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.535
What, like running away?

17:15.285 --> 17:17.704
If we do it together,
I think it's called moving.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.083
I know that's kinda the opposite
of Dusty's thing

17:21.083 --> 17:22.917
about owning your mistakes,

17:22.917 --> 17:26.046
but I also know things
can really stick to you in a small town.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.716
I threw up once on a ninth-grade
field trip to the botanical gardens,

17:29.716 --> 17:32.135
and people have called me
"Barfy Beau" for 20 years.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.512
I've never heard anyone call you that.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.597
It's pretty much all I'm known for.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.727
And now they'll probably call me
"sad cowboy" or some shit.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.898
And they'll call you "the twin brother
of the dead basketball star

17:44.898 --> 17:47.442
who cheated with his girlfriend,"
or I don't know.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.612
They'll come up with something catchier
and more hurtful, probably.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.158
Okay, fine.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.119
Let's do it. Let's--

17:58.036 --> 18:00.414
Let's run away.
Let's light out for the territories.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.124
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.711
Okay, you got it.

18:05.711 --> 18:06.879
I'll start packing.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.090
What do we need?
The throat roaster, obviously.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.800
Obviously, yeah.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.429
And the chainsaw.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.139
In what scenario
would we need to take the chainsaw?

18:17.139 --> 18:19.725
In what scenario
would we not take the chainsaw?

18:19.725 --> 18:21.310
Yeah, good point. Yeah.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.065
You know,

18:27.774 --> 18:31.361
I didn't realize that Trina told me
before she told anyone else.

18:32.738 --> 18:33.864
That's pretty cool.

18:34.406 --> 18:38.118
I mean, not cool, but ballsy.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.372
That girl's got a real pair of nuts
on her, doesn't she?

18:44.499 --> 18:47.628
Yeah. She does.

18:50.506 --> 18:54.009
I don't know why you're doing this.
Is this, like,

18:54.009 --> 18:56.929
a "thank you for being an absent,
shitty mother" present?

18:56.929 --> 18:59.348
No, it's just a little thing.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.099
There's, like, zero chance

19:01.099 --> 19:03.227
that this won't make me feel worse
about myself.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.269
Open it.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.525
Look at that. It's a pretty vase.
It's so beautiful.

19:09.525 --> 19:11.401
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.363
And it's actually more of a chalice.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.866
Kind of like
what a queen would drink out of.

19:18.450 --> 19:22.746
All right. That's cool.
And yeah, I was right.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.999
It's also 99% sure to fall apart
at any second, so...

19:25.999 --> 19:27.835
Cool. Same.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.129
- When did you make this?
- I don't know.

19:31.672 --> 19:35.884
Kinda just whenever I have the time
to take my mind off of things.

19:40.514 --> 19:46.436
Trina, sweetie, I know
that I have not been paying attention

19:46.436 --> 19:48.522
to everything
that you've been going through lately.

19:48.522 --> 19:52.734
I was at the magic show
and at Giorgio's before with Grizzy,

19:52.734 --> 19:55.946
and I saw what she did to you.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.367
Your mom is way more fucked up
than my mom.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.451
Don't worry. I'll get it!

20:01.451 --> 20:04.121
I mean, I'm upstairs,
and you two are right there.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.831
But no, makes more sense for me to get it.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.833
Geez Louise.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.586
- Eat chainsaw, asshole!
- For God's sake.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.087
Yeah, I'm here to murder you,

20:12.087 --> 20:14.715
because your daughter hooked up
with both my sons!

20:14.715 --> 20:16.508
Okay. Jesus. Okay, chill. Chill.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.385
I'm really sorry.
I told him I was coming here.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.430
And he said he had a "killer joke idea,"
which I guess is what that was.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.141
- Did you see that, Jacob? His face.
- Yeah, I saw his face, Dad.

20:24.141 --> 20:25.225
Is it okay if I...

20:25.225 --> 20:26.435
Yeah, please come in.

20:27.644 --> 20:28.812
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.940
- I'm sorry I called you an asshole.
- Yeah, I know, it was really funny.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.318
Hey.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.363
Hey. What's up?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.656
Hi, Mrs. Hubbard.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.741
Hi, Jacob.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.367
Cool.

20:43.702 --> 20:47.581
I was wondering if you wanted
to go with me to Deerfest tonight?

20:47.581 --> 20:50.209
Like, on a date.
Like, yeah-- Like a first date.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.128
You know that Cass and I's first date,
we went to Deerfest.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.296
- Dusty...
- Yeah.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.215
We can talk about it a different time.
Go on.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.926
Well, I was just thinking,
now that everyone knows everything,

20:58.926 --> 21:01.178
- we could--
- I'm sorry I didn't talk to you first.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.679
It's okay.

21:02.679 --> 21:06.892
I'm glad you had the courage
to go and do that.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.228
And now maybe we can, like,
try to get to know each other

21:09.228 --> 21:11.021
and see if we actually like each other.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.524
Again, maybe not the time,
but I've always thought that you two--

21:13.524 --> 21:15.108
- Dad.
- Dusty.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.528
So, do you wanna go to Deerfest?

21:18.445 --> 21:19.446
Can my parents come?

21:21.114 --> 21:22.908
- Trina with the jokes.
- No, I'm not joking.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.868
It's like--
We used to go together all the time,

21:24.868 --> 21:27.538
and, I don't know, I just kinda want
something normal right now.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.291
Going to a deer-themed festival
on your first date with your parents?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.584
I know you don't wanna go.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.045
Grizzy will be there,
and it's, like, a whole thing--

21:35.045 --> 21:38.924
Oh, no. I'll go.
I don't care if she's there.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.218
And people are definitely
gonna give you looks

21:41.218 --> 21:42.719
because of the fake card thing.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.847
- Well, I think we're gonna get more looks.
- Fair.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.932
- So...
- We're gonna get a lot of looks.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.852
I am okay with that, seriously,
if that's what you wanna do.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.104
All right, Beau.

21:52.104 --> 21:55.649
Baby girl wants to go to Deerfest,
so wanna go to Deerfest?

21:55.649 --> 21:57.442
Does this answer your question?

21:59.695 --> 22:00.988
Deerfest!

22:00.988 --> 22:02.531
- That's not funny!
- Yeah!

22:03.282 --> 22:04.825
- Not in the house!
- Sorry.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.827
- Not in the house, Beau!
- Sorry!

22:13.834 --> 22:14.918
Excuse me.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.045
Sorry to interrupt your socializing,

22:17.045 --> 22:19.798
but maybe you've noticed
we're about to open Deerfest,

22:19.798 --> 22:22.885
and I'm just curious about
when you plan to finish the hay maze?

22:22.885 --> 22:23.969
It is finished.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.053
Is it?

22:25.554 --> 22:27.514
Then why can I see
right over the hay bales?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.975
It needs to be twice as high as this.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.226
It's for kids.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.437
And you assume a child
won't appreciate a challenge.

22:33.437 --> 22:36.523
- Excuse me, Mayor Fontaine?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

22:36.523 --> 22:40.068
- You know there's a storm coming?
- I know there's a storm forecasted.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.362
Why do you think we have ponchos?

22:42.905 --> 22:45.616
I suppose you'd be happier
if everybody just stayed home.

22:45.616 --> 22:46.700
Well, I think I would.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.119
If there's lightning,
the hay bales will go up like a torch.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.330
What qualifications do you have
to make this assessment?

22:51.330 --> 22:54.750
Well, I did get a card that said
"Sole Survivor" from the MORPHO machine.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.503
It's my first time being out the house
in a month.

22:57.503 --> 23:00.005
So I'm still a bit nervous
about things I could survive.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.089
Honey, please.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.383
You don't know the first thing
about survival.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.440
What was that? Sounded like thunder.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.109
It was probably just one of the rides.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.947
Trina, if you get scared,
you know that you can hold Daddy's hand.

23:24.947 --> 23:27.533
- Or we can link arms...
- God.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.076
- ...like <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.
- Yes! Yes.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.703
Okay, I already regret inviting you.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.541
Hey, Father Reuben! Deerfest is that way!

23:36.917 --> 23:39.878
I told Father Reuben
about my whole arrow theory.

23:39.878 --> 23:41.255
He was very impressed.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.715
Seems the teacher
has become the "Teacher."

23:43.715 --> 23:46.218
Yeah, I've been thinking about that
a lot actually.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.594
It's pretty good, right?

23:49.221 --> 23:50.389
Yeah.

23:50.389 --> 23:51.557
What?

23:51.557 --> 23:53.016
- Nothing.
- What?

23:55.143 --> 23:56.144
No, I--

23:57.479 --> 23:59.565
I guess I'm just wondering if--

24:00.732 --> 24:03.944
if this is all about a turn in the road
like you said,

24:03.944 --> 24:06.446
then what if we don't turn together?

24:08.073 --> 24:09.324
How do you mean?

24:10.826 --> 24:14.580
What if our arrows don't point
in the same direction?

24:18.542 --> 24:19.668
I don't know.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.646
Hello?

25:02.419 --> 25:03.420
Hana.

25:04.922 --> 25:06.089
What you doing?

25:07.216 --> 25:11.345
Just trying to fix this hole in the roof
before the big storm comes.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.680
So, you've been listening
to Axel's weather reports, huh?

25:13.680 --> 25:17.309
I don't know who Axel is,
but I've been listening to the news.

25:17.309 --> 25:18.894
What do you normally do when it rains?

25:18.894 --> 25:21.188
I have an elaborate system
called a bucket.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.398
But I don't think it's gonna cut it
for this one,

25:23.398 --> 25:26.193
and I don't wanna wake up
in six feet of water, so...

25:26.777 --> 25:28.695
Wait, what do you mean "wake up"?

25:30.280 --> 25:31.657
Yeah, this is my room.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.452
I'm sorry. I--

25:36.662 --> 25:38.330
I didn't realize you slept here.

25:40.249 --> 25:43.710
It looks more like the room
of a small child who died 80 years ago.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.338
Thanks.
That's the aesthetic I was going for.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.924
- Where's all your things?
- I like to travel light.

25:48.924 --> 25:51.552
Actually got rid of a bunch of stuff
right when I got here.

25:52.845 --> 25:54.179
Why did you come here?

25:57.474 --> 25:58.684
What do you mean?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.937
What led you to this town, of all places?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.400
I could ask you the same thing.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.152
I came because there was an opening
at the high school for a chaplain.

26:09.152 --> 26:13.240
- Same. But I guess you got it.
- Hana, I'm serious. I wanna know.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.243
Why did you come here now?

26:18.495 --> 26:19.955
What are you doing here, Father?

26:25.210 --> 26:26.920
I don't wanna be a priest anymore.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.186
Well, this could be a problem.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.388
Abracadabra.

27:38.617 --> 27:39.993
Mr. Johnson?

27:59.054 --> 28:00.055
Mr. Johnson!

28:08.730 --> 28:09.731
Oh, shoot.
