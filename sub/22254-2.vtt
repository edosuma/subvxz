WEBVTT

00:11.345 --> 00:12.555
So, at the end of the day,

00:12.638 --> 00:15.224
I'm just a regular guy trying
to live a regular life.

00:15.307 --> 00:18.477
Remember that time you peed
in Drew Barrymore's car?

00:18.561 --> 00:21.522
Uh, yes, I remember that.
Why do you remember that?

00:21.606 --> 00:23.023
It was in your book.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.026
-You should do that to someone here.
-What? No.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.906
Well, anyway, I can't believe
I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

00:29.989 --> 00:33.033
I feel like that anonymous girl
from Chapter 8 of your book

00:33.158 --> 00:35.995
mixed with the pluck and determination
of that anonymous girl

00:36.078 --> 00:39.123
-from Chapter 12.
-We don't need to dwell on the past.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.417
Wait, shut up.
Is this the restaurant you bought

00:41.500 --> 00:44.503
when you were trying
to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

00:44.587 --> 00:47.214
-Uh... No.
-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.300
Want to yell at the waiter
and make a scene?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.970
-No, I don't need--
-Come on, do that BoJack thing

00:52.052 --> 00:54.263
where you make a big deal
and everyone laughs,

00:54.346 --> 00:55.848
but at the same time we relate,

00:55.932 --> 00:58.559
because you're saying
the things polite society won't.

00:58.643 --> 00:59.644
That's not-- Ugh...

00:59.727 --> 01:03.230
-Is everything all right over here?
-No, everything is not all right.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.316
This table's been wobbling all evening.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.945
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick
for an hour, I'd call your mother.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.906
-Something in that area or...?
-Take me home now

01:11.990 --> 01:15.367
and don't let me get out of bed
until I turn horse-colored.

01:16.995 --> 01:19.079
-What are you doing?
-Did you want me to stay?

01:19.163 --> 01:20.999
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.417
Some of us here are trying
to forget you exist.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.837
"Forget you exist."
Classic BoJack. Love it.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.338
[BoJack sighs]

01:27.546 --> 01:30.633
[Claire] Oh, my God, are you Todd?
[Todd] Uh, yes.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.051
[Claire] "Shut up, Todd!"

01:32.134 --> 01:33.552
[Claire laughs]

01:33.761 --> 01:35.387
[Todd] Aw, okay.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.725
[♪♪]

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.612 --> 02:35.781
Hey, Todd, can you drive me
to get my car?

02:35.865 --> 02:38.617
I wanted to be responsible last night,
so I Ubered home

02:38.701 --> 02:40.953
-and left my car in the fountain.
-Sorry, BoJack.

02:41.079 --> 02:46.375
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.
It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.712
I realize that by saying "what"
I might set off a chain of events

02:49.795 --> 02:52.256
whereby we continue this conversation,
but what?

02:52.339 --> 02:55.093
Well, remember when I first moved in
and I kept asking

02:55.175 --> 02:57.177
-if we could go to Disneyland?
-I do not.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.889
And then you said
that there was no Disneyland.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.725
-No.
-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

03:02.808 --> 03:06.145
like the tooth fairy, that parents use
to get their kids to behave.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.814
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.
-Sure did.

03:08.898 --> 03:12.401
But then I thought,
why isn't there a Disneyland?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.652
People would love it!

03:13.736 --> 03:15.947
So, I took matters into my own hands,

03:16.030 --> 03:19.700
and over the last five years,
I built my own Disneyland.

03:19.784 --> 03:23.328
You've been doing this for five years?
How have you never mentioned it?

03:23.454 --> 03:27.458
I bought that cheap plot of non-arable
dirt by the toxic waste dump

03:27.541 --> 03:30.419
-up the hill from the old fire station.
-Okay, Todd.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.547
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.
-Sounds great, champ.

03:33.631 --> 03:36.134
If it wasn't for that,
she never would've gotten sober.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.804
Just finished drawing up blueprints
for that Disneyland I'm building.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.139
Kind of busy here, Todd.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.891
So, it turned out to be a good thing
I peed in her car.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.893
Sorry for all the noise.

03:45.977 --> 03:49.814
Got this crew of worker bees
to help me build my Disneyland.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.400
Okay, I get it. You are building
your own Disneyland.

03:53.484 --> 03:57.571
-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.
-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

03:57.655 --> 04:02.118
Finally, people will have a place to go
after they win the Super Bowl.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.578
But you do know
that there already is a Disneyland?

04:04.703 --> 04:07.706
-Yeah, I built it.
-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.793
You mean, the one in the hearts
and minds of children everywhere?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.671
-The one in Anaheim!
-I think we're saying the same thing.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.089
Are we?

04:17.632 --> 04:20.761
Well, I think it's safe
to take the cone off.

04:20.845 --> 04:23.181
I can do it for a small co-pay.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.640
Can't say I'll miss it,

04:24.723 --> 04:29.103
but we did have some crazy adventures
together these last few weeks.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.192
Honey, would you rub my chin for me
so I can remember things?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.194
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

04:36.777 --> 04:38.821
Yeah, memories.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.074
Hey, where should we go for my first meal
after the operation?

04:42.158 --> 04:44.785
It's not an operation,
but we could go to Storky's again.

04:44.869 --> 04:48.080
Oh, yeah! We're finally due
for our free sub.

04:48.206 --> 04:51.542
"Storky's,
where your 81st sandwich is free."

04:51.625 --> 04:54.920
We've been there 80 times?
It just opened last month.

04:55.004 --> 04:58.716
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever
you suggest it, I always say yes.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.385
Yeah, but 80 times?

05:02.053 --> 05:05.347
Well, that'll be $6000.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.267
Good thing you're getting
a free sandwich, huh?

05:11.062 --> 05:12.271
What the...?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.900
Huh?

05:16.192 --> 05:20.320
Okay, you guys. [yells]
You vultures are killing me!

05:20.404 --> 05:22.948
I'm sure he's talking about
other vultures.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.536
Ah, the Valley.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.414
Because sometimes you wanna go
where no one knows your name.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.418
-[Pinky] BoJack Horseman!
-Pinky? Hey, how are you?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.003
[stammers]

05:36.128 --> 05:37.296
Oh, great!

05:37.379 --> 05:39.173
-How's the book biz?
-Who knows?

05:39.257 --> 05:43.219
I jumped off that burning ship.
Print media? What a joke.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.471
Now I got a job
in broadcast network television,

05:46.555 --> 05:50.893
a booming industry
with nowhere to go but up.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.228
Oh, God.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.980
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, my boss loves this place.

05:55.064 --> 05:57.149
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

05:57.233 --> 06:00.236
Wanda just got named head
of programming at MBN.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.653
We're here to celebrate.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.782
Well, that and she just woke up
from a 30-year coma.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.201
Wait, she just got out
of a 30-year coma

06:07.285 --> 06:10.454
and she's the head of programming
at a major broadcast network?

06:10.579 --> 06:14.666
She's been with the company 30 years.
Everyone above her kept getting fired.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.086
Besides, she's got
some really fresh ideas.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.047
I am really feeling
The Kirk Cameron Show.

06:20.131 --> 06:23.092
I don't even need a pilot.
Let's just order 22 episodes.

06:24.135 --> 06:27.596
How about a new show
where celebrities try to guess

06:27.679 --> 06:29.348
whether or not people have talent?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.058
We'll air it three nights a week.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.310
[all gasp]

06:32.392 --> 06:36.272
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar
David Copperfield

06:36.355 --> 06:39.691
to make
the World Trade Center disappear?

06:40.484 --> 06:43.112
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

06:43.195 --> 06:46.531
but David Copperfield really isn't
a big draw anymore.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.034
Actually, everything feels fresh

06:49.118 --> 06:51.662
if you just forget
the last 30 years ever happened.

06:51.787 --> 06:52.871
Huh.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.665
[woman over PA]
And here's a special request.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.125
I've never even heard of this song,

06:56.208 --> 06:59.086
but let's give it a spin:
"Special Feeling."

06:59.170 --> 07:02.756
Wanda, meet
the one and only BoJack Horseman.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.300
-Who?
-BoJack.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.884
-Who?
-BoJack Horseman.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.095
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

07:08.220 --> 07:14.059
[light rock ballad playing over speakers]

07:14.143 --> 07:16.812
-Do you want to go skate?
-Nah. You know what they say,

07:16.895 --> 07:19.690
you can lead a horse to roller,
but you can't make him rink.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.150
[laughing]

07:21.275 --> 07:23.902
-What?
-That's really funny.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.279
-You're funny.
-Really?

07:25.363 --> 07:27.447
Oh, my God. You should be on TV,

07:27.531 --> 07:29.783
[gasps]
which, holy shit, they're flat now.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.412
Actually, I was on. You know what,
I'm sick of talking about me.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.664
Let's talk about you.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.922
[Wanda] Next thing I know,
I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.343
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,
but it's not ideal.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.137
She's molting.
You know how sisters are.

07:50.221 --> 07:53.682
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here
with the regulars.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.476
How hard is it to look
before they bring it out?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.896
-Excuse me, miss?
-I know, isn't it cool?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.273
-Like we're getting away with something.
-What?

08:01.357 --> 08:04.526
Don't you love it when appetizers have
a little crossover episode?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.446
It's like when you're watching
Happy Days and Mork shows up.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.989
Oh, yeah, I guess.

08:09.073 --> 08:11.158
Or like when Kramer was
on Murphy Brown.

08:11.242 --> 08:14.578
-Who?
-Hey, you want to get out of here?

08:17.998 --> 08:22.420
I don't want MBN to just be another boring
old network, you know what I mean?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.504
-Yes, totally.
-I want to take risks.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.550
I want to swing for the fences, you know?
Otherwise, what are we doing?

08:28.633 --> 08:31.553
Oh, my God, is it morning?
We stayed up all night talking,

08:31.636 --> 08:34.765
-and we didn't even have sex.
-Well, it's not too late.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.849
Oh!

08:40.354 --> 08:43.023
-That was fantastic.
-Oh, yes.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.193
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.
I hope.

08:46.277 --> 08:47.736
-Something's wrong.
-What is it?

08:47.819 --> 08:51.198
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want
to spend more time with you

08:51.282 --> 08:54.076
-even though I know we just had sex.
-Oh, okay.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.453
No, you don't understand.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.039
We already had sex,
but I still want to spend time with you.

08:59.164 --> 09:03.294
Is that normal? Am I normal?
What is happening to me?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.087
We can spend more time together.

09:05.170 --> 09:10.509
I want to do things with you.
Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.677
-Okay.
-I don't understand these feelings.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.890
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

09:16.974 --> 09:19.643
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.647
-Do you want to go to Disneyland?
-Okay.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.987
[carnival music playing over speakers]

09:31.489 --> 09:33.198
[child crying]

09:33.740 --> 09:37.369
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires
and loose nails than I remember.

09:37.453 --> 09:40.247
Please hold your questions
until the end of the tour.

09:40.372 --> 09:44.209
Here we have
Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.586
The name is a work in progress,

09:46.670 --> 09:50.007
but we wanted to work "death"
into the title for liability reasons.

09:50.090 --> 09:55.220
And this is Gabe Jr.,
the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

09:55.304 --> 10:00.267
-This is boring. I want to go home.
-Vincent, be nice!

10:00.351 --> 10:02.978
He's a little cranky
because he just got adult braces.

10:03.061 --> 10:07.232
-You mean, braces.
-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

10:07.316 --> 10:08.150
Ugh.

10:08.233 --> 10:13.947
And here we have Cinderella's
magical pile of used mattresses.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.032
[child] Help!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.201
Is it a good idea
to keep all those mattresses

10:17.284 --> 10:21.455
-so close to an active grease fire?
-Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

10:21.580 --> 10:25.334
-Your friend is really negative.
-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.211
-What?
-You know I hate negativity.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.922
I mean, I don't hate it because
that's also negative, but you know.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.717
[quacks, then yells]

10:33.800 --> 10:34.843
[children laughing]

10:34.926 --> 10:39.306
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.
-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

10:39.390 --> 10:42.518
It's like some sort of Disney version
of Knott's Berry Farm.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.978
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going for!

10:45.062 --> 10:46.605
I can't wait to get involved

10:46.688 --> 10:49.858
and really spray the old
Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

10:49.941 --> 10:55.155
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this
as kind of just my thing.

10:55.239 --> 10:59.577
Well, technically, you did build this
while working for P.B. Livin,

10:59.659 --> 11:03.038
so I have the blah-blah-blah
of first refusal or whatever.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.748
Oh, uh, okay.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.666
I mean, that's just good business.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.212
We're in this together now, Todd,
and nothing will distract me from--

11:10.295 --> 11:14.007
Erica! You can't be here.
This place is filled with children.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.137
Coach said he saw you headed
to the visitor's locker room

11:19.221 --> 11:20.472
with a steel pipe.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.350
You really think I'm the guy
who busted that pinto's leg?

11:23.434 --> 11:27.145
'Cause if I am, you should be
a lot more goddamn scared of me.

11:27.229 --> 11:31.650
Hey! My girlfriend's here.
Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

11:31.733 --> 11:33.110
Sure. We'll cut there.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.695
The middle of your line
is as good a place as any.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.073
-What are you doing here?
-Just wanted to stop by.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.076
We're filming Hey, I Think
You Can Dance! next door.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.287
Look at you, all professional.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.415
Like Natalie Portman in that movie
where she was a professional.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.750
Who? [giggles]
People are watching.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.668
Ugh.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.087
The first time BoJack dates a woman
his own age,

11:52.170 --> 11:54.298
she's basically just
a stunted 20-year-old.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.092
Well, BoJack's stunted, too.
He got famous in his twenties,

11:57.175 --> 11:58.802
so he'll be
in his twenties forever.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.430
After you get famous, you stop growing,
you don't have to.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.974
Every celebrity has
an age of stagnation.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.601
I'm glad I never got famous.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.770
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,
but I'm not famous-famous.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.814
It doesn't just happen
when you get famous.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.108
Your age of stagnation
is when you stop growing.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.944
For most, it's when they get married,
settle into a routine.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.238
You meet someone
who loves you unconditionally

12:18.322 --> 12:21.032
and never challenges you
or wants you to change,

12:21.116 --> 12:23.034
and then you never change.

12:23.118 --> 12:26.371
But mostly it's just the famous people,
right?

12:29.374 --> 12:32.794
Stella! Stella!

12:32.877 --> 12:34.296
Corona Light.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.423
This place is incredible.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.634
I wanted to make you feel at home,

12:38.717 --> 12:42.053
and nothing was bigger in the '80s
than '50s nostalgia.

12:42.137 --> 12:46.224
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,
feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.561
It's like if Back to the Future
and Peggy Sue Got Married got married.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.438
[man over radio]
Okay, teenyboppers,

12:51.522 --> 12:54.608
let's take things back
to the '50s, '50s style,

12:54.692 --> 12:58.737
with this classic '50s hit
that everybody remembers:

12:58.820 --> 13:01.906
"I Just Met My Perfect Match."

13:01.990 --> 13:04.535
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

13:08.955 --> 13:12.376
Wanda, these last few days
have been so amazing.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.461
You've given me a fresh start.

13:14.545 --> 13:17.881
In fact, it almost feels like
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.925
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up
from a 30-year coma?

13:21.009 --> 13:23.428
-Oh, no, not me. Her.
-That's insane.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.263
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.431
[record stops]

13:26.515 --> 13:28.850
Whoa!
Sorry about that needle skip, folks.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.437
Let's start that song again
from the beginning.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.191
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

13:39.403 --> 13:40.696
I'm Alex.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.573
-Wanda.
-And I'm BoJack.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.033
It's been really tough for me
these last few weeks.

13:45.116 --> 13:48.870
I've never seen Home Alone and everyone
makes me feel like a freak because of it.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.498
-You've never seen Home Alone?
-I've never seen it!

13:51.582 --> 13:54.793
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.
-Neither do I!

13:54.918 --> 13:59.089
-No one does. It's just a magic box.
-Wanda, we have so much in common.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.591
Really it's just one thing.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.802
You can't count each individual thing
as a different thing.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.471
That's like saying I have a lot
in common with Kanye West

14:06.555 --> 14:07.931
because we both breathe air.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.475
[both]
Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.686
What's a Coke Zero?
I have no idea.

14:12.770 --> 14:13.812
[both laughing]

14:13.895 --> 14:17.190
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know
there was anyone else like me.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.360
Give me your fax and pager number
so I can add them to my Rolodex.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.653
Tubular.

14:21.737 --> 14:22.821
[BoJack sighs]

14:23.697 --> 14:27.200
I don't trust that guy.
I bet he's seen Home Alone.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.161
BoJack, I'm starting to lose
the thread of your character.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.957
You think you can drop the jealous
boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.460
You're right, I'm sorry.
Call me Snoop Dogg

14:36.543 --> 14:39.671
-because I will drop it like it's hot.
-BoJack, I don't--

14:39.755 --> 14:43.675
I got that one! Snoopy the dog.
From "Peanuts." Okay.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.433
I got here as fast as I could.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.060
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

14:54.144 --> 14:56.396
-That was a lie to get you here.
-Aw, fish.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.691
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.
-And there never will be.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.611
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd
running his own Disneyland

15:02.694 --> 15:04.613
and actress Margo Martindale
in prison

15:04.696 --> 15:07.783
for some reason I don't remember,
you're the best friend I've got.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.119
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt
on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.204
No, BoJack. What's the play here?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.582
You'll find one little imperfection
and harp on it

15:15.666 --> 15:17.041
like you do with my boyfriend?

15:17.167 --> 15:19.961
You do understand what my "thing" is
with your boyfriend?

15:20.044 --> 15:22.506
You'll just push her
into this other guy's arms.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.425
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

15:27.302 --> 15:30.555
This is Comrade Alexander
calling KGB High Command.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.850
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.352
and I still have not been contacted
by my handlers.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.730
I am awaiting orders to take down
the American dogs and pigs

15:38.814 --> 15:42.066
and other various animals and humans.
Come in, KGB High Command.

15:42.150 --> 15:46.196
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.870
Hey, what's going on here?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.206
You've been served
with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

15:56.289 --> 15:57.833
the Walt Disney Company.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.085
I wanted to make sure what we were
doing here was 100 percent legal,

16:01.169 --> 16:03.046
-so I called a lawyer.
-Wait, what?

16:03.129 --> 16:06.591
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.
Who knew?

16:06.675 --> 16:10.261
-Mr. Peanutbutter.
-We'll see you in court.

16:10.345 --> 16:13.849
-The food court?
-No. Regular court.

16:13.932 --> 16:18.978
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might
just stop by the food court first.

16:20.564 --> 16:25.903
Let the record show, this is the single
dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.029
-Mr. Chavez?
-Okay.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.823
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

16:29.907 --> 16:34.285
Is it possible maybe when the other guys
tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

16:34.369 --> 16:36.663
they wrote down something else
by mistake,

16:36.747 --> 16:38.998
so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

16:39.082 --> 16:44.713
Okay, well, let's have a look
at the Articles of Incorporation to see

16:44.838 --> 16:49.551
if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked
the wrong name. I'm sure these--

16:49.634 --> 16:50.635
[stammers]

16:50.761 --> 16:54.639
-What?
-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

16:54.723 --> 16:59.143
With two "i"s. That son of a gun
trademarked the wrong name.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.312
May I, counselor?

17:01.396 --> 17:04.900
D-I-I-S.
This is unambiguous.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.612
-I find in favor of the defendant.
-Aw, shit.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.196
-You're the defendant.
-Aw, sweet!

17:11.281 --> 17:14.992
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage
of justice.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.913
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

17:21.332 --> 17:27.130
And that's how I turned my dream into
what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

17:27.255 --> 17:30.634
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom
I added to the Disney canon.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.262
-Americans, they like this theme park?
-Oh, they love it.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.473
It represents everything
America stands for.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.849
Da.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.435
-I mean, yeah.
-We did it, buddy!

17:40.518 --> 17:42.604
Actually, I did it.

17:42.687 --> 17:49.027
I had the idea to build a park,
I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

17:49.110 --> 17:54.407
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?
-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

17:54.491 --> 18:00.330
And unlike that other Disneyland,
this Disneyland only has one "i".

18:00.413 --> 18:01.665
What are you saying?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.501
You're not welcome
at my theme park anymore.

18:04.626 --> 18:09.547
There's only room for one goofy dog there
and his name is Pluto.

18:09.631 --> 18:10.924
Todd, no.

18:11.008 --> 18:14.845
I've told the bees
if they see you to sting you on sight.

18:14.928 --> 18:19.599
You understand. It's nothing personal.
It's just good business.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.060
And that's how we do business on Urf.

18:22.143 --> 18:26.397
-I don't like you like this.
-I learned it from you.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.608
If I could get everyone's attention.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.778
You're probably wondering
why I invited you all here tonight.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.364
You said it was to celebrate
Todd's legal victory.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.491
Right, but obviously,
I don't care about that,

18:36.574 --> 18:38.618
so you're probably wondering
the real reason.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.245
[Princess Carolyn]
No, we just took you at face value.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.331
We have a special guest here tonight.

18:43.414 --> 18:46.668
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

18:46.835 --> 18:48.461
[BoJack gasps]

18:48.795 --> 18:52.298
-Why would you say "comrade"?
-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

18:52.382 --> 18:55.969
Alex is a KGB agent
bent on destroying America.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.054
[all gasp]

18:57.136 --> 19:00.807
-It truly is a small world after all!
-Alex, is that true?

19:00.891 --> 19:03.601
Okay, yes. It's true.

19:03.685 --> 19:07.022
I was a deep-cover KGB operative
before I went into my coma.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.607
I've been trying to contact
my handler in Russia,

19:09.691 --> 19:12.527
but I can't reach him
and I don't know if I ever will.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.653
[all] Aww!

19:13.737 --> 19:16.197
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

19:16.280 --> 19:20.201
He's a soviet sleeper-agent
who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.954
I felt totally alone in this world
before I met Wanda.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.749
And then I met all of you, my friends.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.500
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

19:27.584 --> 19:30.003
just because I think
you're all capitalist swine

19:30.128 --> 19:33.381
and want to see your way
of life destroyed, well, so be it.

19:33.464 --> 19:38.177
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.
-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.681
-That's not even good wordplay.
-Wait, how did you know all this?

19:41.765 --> 19:45.769
-BoJack, were you spying on him?
-He is literally a spy

19:45.852 --> 19:48.605
trying to destroy America,
the country we all live in.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.898
How am I the bad guy here?

19:49.981 --> 19:54.069
BoJack, I am really bumping on
the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.654
-You told me you were going to drop it.
-Yeah, but--

19:56.738 --> 19:58.322
I don't care about Alex.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.575
I want to know what happened
to the amazing guy

20:00.658 --> 20:03.954
I spent the last few days with,
because if this is who you are,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.496
I don't think I like it.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.874
Alex, would you take me back
to my sister's place?

20:07.958 --> 20:10.752
Sure thing, Wanda.
And I can get you there fast

20:10.877 --> 20:12.378
because I'm always Russian.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.546
[all] Aww!

20:13.630 --> 20:14.756
Seriously?

20:18.135 --> 20:20.095
[BoJack sighs]
[Princess Carolyn gasps]

20:20.178 --> 20:23.264
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's the next Dakota Fa--?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.975
Oh, I get what happened.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.145
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?
I didn't want to stand up.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.438
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.316
You called me all the way over here
to not get you a beer?

20:33.399 --> 20:36.736
Why do I always do this?
I push away everyone I care about.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.905
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.783
Look, you obviously really care
about this girl

20:41.866 --> 20:44.452
and that scares you,
so you sabotage yourself.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.413
That's my problem.
I'm too good at sabotage.

20:47.497 --> 20:51.375
-Why am I so good at everything I do?
-Hey, I got a crazy idea.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.671
How about you just stop sulking
and go win her back, dummy?

20:54.796 --> 20:58.675
You're right. I gotta win her back,
put it all on the line. You know what?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.302
I think I will have that beer,
can you get it for me?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.345
[sighs]

21:02.428 --> 21:05.098
-Why do I bother?
-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

21:05.182 --> 21:06.808
Actually, I want both beers!

21:13.898 --> 21:16.026
-Wanda.
-What do you want, BoJack?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.069
There's something I gotta say.
When I was--

21:18.153 --> 21:21.781
-Todd! There's something I gotta say!
-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

21:21.865 --> 21:24.534
I never should have tried
to make your thing my thing!

21:24.617 --> 21:28.621
I just got excited and wanted to smear
Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

21:28.705 --> 21:32.167
I should have been supporting you,
like this support beam.

21:34.211 --> 21:37.964
-Or a different support beam.
-It's my fault.

21:38.048 --> 21:41.676
The point of Disneyland isn't
to make money and win lawsuits.

21:41.759 --> 21:42.969
But I forgot that.

21:43.094 --> 21:47.098
So, these two were so consumed
by greed that it destroyed them.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.600
You know, I came here today
to blow up Disneyland.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.352
-You what?
-But now I realize,

21:51.435 --> 21:53.354
I don't need to take down capitalism.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.274
Capitalism sows the seeds
for its own destruction.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.527
It's a snake that eats itself.
It's only a matter of time.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.904
[whistling]

22:01.196 --> 22:03.240
Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

22:03.948 --> 22:07.118
Oh, no, no, no. No!

22:07.202 --> 22:08.828
Gabe Jr.!

22:08.912 --> 22:10.788
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

22:10.872 --> 22:13.958
Jump to safety! No!

22:14.042 --> 22:16.920
Bees, help!
Your queen commands you!

22:20.882 --> 22:25.262
No! Bees! Come on!

22:25.344 --> 22:26.679
[groaning]

22:26.763 --> 22:29.933
-You gotta-- Over the--
-What is it, boy? What's wrong?

22:30.016 --> 22:33.978
-Hey, there's trouble.
-Did some kid fall down a well?

22:34.062 --> 22:35.396
No, no, no! Listen.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.648
He's trying to tell us
a kid fell down a well.

22:37.732 --> 22:40.777
-Let's go, go, go! Come on!
-Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

22:40.860 --> 22:43.280
No, no, no, listen!

22:44.739 --> 22:46.365
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.576
-But the fire.
-I don't care about that.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.704
Look, the great guy you've been
getting to know, that's me.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.623
That other guy,
the guy from the party,

22:53.706 --> 22:57.752
that's me too and you need
to know that. I'm not perfect.

22:57.835 --> 23:01.505
I'm cynical and I'm possessive
and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.926
I'm not always the best
at being not terrible.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.304
I gotta say,
I'm not loving this pitch so far.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.973
But I want to be better,
I'm trying to be better.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.642
And when I'm around you,
for the first time in 30 years,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.227
I feel like I can be.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.604
Wanda, you make me want
to be a better man.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.773
Wow. That's a great line.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.525
-Did you just come up with that?
-Yes.

23:21.609 --> 23:25.113
Hey, boys and girls,
this is your park DJ speaking.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.116
And as the Titanic's band played on
as the ship sank,

23:28.199 --> 23:33.330
so too will I spin one last record
as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.333
[slow rock ballad playing over speakers]

23:44.007 --> 23:46.217
[both grunting]

23:56.686 --> 23:58.271
Hooray!

24:04.027 --> 24:05.528
Mr. Peanutbutter.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.238
-You saved me!
-No.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.241
I saved us.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.244
Woo-hoo!

24:13.328 --> 24:16.206
-I want to give this a real shot.
-I don't know, BoJack.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.167
I just got out of my coma,
and I don't have time to waste

24:19.250 --> 24:21.252
if you're still figuring your shit out.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.214
Plus, it's hard to think straight
with this fire everywhere.

24:24.339 --> 24:26.132
-Move in with me.
-What?

24:26.216 --> 24:28.426
I know it feels fast.
We barely know each other.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.095
It's crazy, but I like you.

24:31.179 --> 24:34.307
And sometimes you gotta swing
for the fences, right?

24:34.391 --> 24:36.351
-Okay.
-Yeah?

24:36.434 --> 24:39.437
Yeah. Let's move in together.
Let's do it.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.232
It's crazy, but let's do it!
