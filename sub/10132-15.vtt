08:53.908 --> 08:56.953
lunch with Kimmy tomorrow.

08:56.995 --> 09:01.041
No problem. I'll bring

08:56.995 --> 09:01.041
a friend, we'll double.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.751
- See ya, honey.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.751
- Oh, Harold, honey?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.379
- Harold?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.379
- Bye, chief.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.339
Don't call me chief.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.261
You rat! You skunk!

09:13.303 --> 09:15.763
You skunky rat!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.849
You stole my man!

09:19.893 --> 09:23.146
Man? I have Ken dolls

09:19.893 --> 09:23.146
bigger than him.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.024
[whistling]

09:30.320 --> 09:32.739
Danny, come on. Gumby doesn't

09:30.320 --> 09:32.739
stretch as much as you do.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.535
Proper warm-up prevents injury.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.412
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.289
- Play ball.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.289
- Alright.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.252
Hey, look, the girls

09:43.458 --> 09:45.252
locker room's open.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.006
The only reason I still fall

09:48.338 --> 09:50.006
for that

09:50.048 --> 09:52.675
is because the one time

09:50.048 --> 09:52.675
it really was open.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.344
- Okay, your ball out.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.344
- Okay.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.143
Oh! Look, a glacier

09:59.140 --> 10:02.143
passed by the window.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.861
Isn't this great?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.861
It's just like the old days.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.239
I'm still taller then you.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.574
Remember the last

10:14.281 --> 10:15.574
time we played?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.910
July 29th, 1972.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.910
It was raining.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.870
You got mad because

10:18.952 --> 10:20.870
I fouled you with my umbrella.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.747
[chuckles]

10:22.789 --> 10:24.583
- Joseph.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.583
- Hey, Jess, what's up?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.084
Guys, we're in the middle

10:24.624 --> 10:26.084
of a game.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.794
Traveling. My ball.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.923
Great news, pal.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.923
We saved the cookie account.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.258
That is great news.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.426
Danny, uh, my mom's

10:33.300 --> 10:34.426
watching the girls.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.136
I'm going over to Hippo's.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.929
A bunch of us from the agency

10:36.177 --> 10:37.929
are gonna celebrate the way

10:37.971 --> 10:40.348
we turned Chippy Chunk-nuts

10:37.971 --> 10:40.348
into Nutty-Chewy Chunk Chips.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.767
Hey, I'm your partner.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.767
I'm going with you.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.062
- Bye, Danny.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.062
- Uh, Jesse.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.897
I promised Danny

10:46.104 --> 10:47.897
that I'd play basketball--

10:47.939 --> 10:50.525
Oh, no, no.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.525
Don't let me ruin your fun.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.693
Go, party with strangers.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.655
Hold on, Jesse.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.655
Danny, we'll play sudden death.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.199
We'll finish the game.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.199
Next basket wins.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.909
Thanks for squeezing me in, pal.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.078
- Hurry up. I'll wait for you.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.078
- Alright. Here we go.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.419
Foul on the big man.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.419
I got wristing.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.671
Wristing? What the heck

11:09.461 --> 11:11.671
is wristing?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.090
You hit me on the wrist.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.090
You got a better name for it?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.716
I hit all ball.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.719
Jesse, you saw it.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.719
Did I wrist him?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.096
Pal, you did hit

11:18.761 --> 11:20.096
him on the wrist.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
So if there's such

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
a thing as wristing

11:22.223 --> 11:23.724
I'd have to say,

11:22.223 --> 11:23.724
yes, you wristed him.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.977
Oh, okay, fine. Take his side.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.854
What else is new?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.854
Thanks for the game.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.023
It's nice hanging out with you.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.023
Real quality time.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.942
Danny, we'll play later.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.942
What's the big deal?

11:32.984 --> 11:35.195
If I have to explain it,

11:32.984 --> 11:35.195
then, I don't know

11:35.236 --> 11:37.238
why we were friends

11:35.236 --> 11:37.238
in the first place.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.366
Danny, you're acting

11:37.280 --> 11:39.366
like a little kid.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.369
I am not. Now, give

11:39.407 --> 11:42.369
me back my ball.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.830
[instrumental music]

11:48.833 --> 11:50.377
[instrumental music]

11:53.796 --> 11:55.006
Hi, D.J.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.759
Michelle, what are you

11:56.174 --> 11:58.759
doing in here?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.428
I don't know.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.098
Here's the rest

12:02.055 --> 12:04.098
of your stuff, Michelle.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.226
Thanks for switching rooms

12:04.140 --> 12:06.226
with me.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.312
Stephanie, there's no way

12:07.561 --> 12:09.312
I'm sharing a room

12:09.354 --> 12:10.897
with a two-year-old.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.567
There's no way<i> I'm</i> sharing

12:10.938 --> 12:13.567
a room with a no-good

12:13.608 --> 12:17.862
skunky, ratty, rotten,

12:13.608 --> 12:17.862
lame-oid boyfriend stealer.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.782
Would you get off this?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.618
Harry's a first-grade kid

12:21.824 --> 12:23.618
with a crush

12:23.660 --> 12:25.412
on an attractive older woman.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.249
Watch out, Michelle.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.210
She'll be your best buddy until

12:29.290 --> 12:32.210
you've got something she wants.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.046
And then nothing is safe.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.387
Michelle, don't believe her.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.387
You know you can trust me.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.930
My bunny.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.310
[buzzing]

12:57.776 --> 12:59.070
Well, it had to happen.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.821
The vacuum cleaner

12:59.112 --> 13:00.821
finally turned on him.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.533
[laughing]

13:03.575 --> 13:04.743
Danny, what's going on with you?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.537
Why'd you walk off

13:04.783 --> 13:07.537
the court today?

13:07.579 --> 13:11.207
Oh, no, you don't. Don't give me

13:07.579 --> 13:11.207
the vacuum treatment.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.961
Hey, never pull my plug

13:11.249 --> 13:14.961
when I'm cleaning.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.672
Never point your finger at me

13:15.002 --> 13:17.672
unless I've food on my face.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.259
- Never tell me what to do--

13:17.714 --> 13:21.259
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:21.301 --> 13:22.552
Fred, Ethel.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.097
Look, man, are you guys gonna

13:24.053 --> 13:26.097
let a basketball game

13:26.139 --> 13:27.806
break up a 20 year friendship?

13:27.848 --> 13:29.601
The only reason we became

13:27.848 --> 13:29.601
friends in the first place

13:29.643 --> 13:31.894
was because the day we met,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.894
I saved his butt.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.898
Oh, you got that all backwards,

13:31.936 --> 13:35.898
Jack. I saved your butt.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.651
Excuse me,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.651
but if my memory serves me

13:37.692 --> 13:40.737
and it always does,

13:37.692 --> 13:40.737
it happened exactly like this.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.573
We were in the fifth grade.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.573
We just finished lunch.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.660
I remember, it was macaroni

13:43.615 --> 13:46.660
and cheese and Jell-O cubes.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.953
No, wait a second, I traded

13:46.701 --> 13:48.953
the Jell-O cubes for succotash.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.664
I don't like Jell-O cubes

13:50.705 --> 13:52.206
'cause they got pieces of fruit,

13:50.705 --> 13:52.206
they get stuck in your teeth.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.292
Just tell the story, huh?

13:55.376 --> 13:58.171
Okay. The year was 1968.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.507
We were sitting

13:58.212 --> 14:00.507
in front of school on a bench.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.050
<i>(Danny) </i>

14:00.548 --> 14:03.050
<i>My nose was bleeding...again.</i>

14:04.636 --> 14:08.014
Off to a bad start at your

14:04.636 --> 14:08.014
new school, Joseph Gladstone.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.351
Clowns belong in the circus,

14:08.055 --> 14:11.351
not in the schoolyard.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.354
Now, unless you wanna be

14:11.392 --> 14:14.354
suspended on your first day

14:14.395 --> 14:17.940
sit right here

14:14.395 --> 14:17.940
and don't move a muscle.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.737
How's that nosebleed, Daniel?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.448
Clotting nicely.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.448
Thank you, Miss Borland.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.788
Who wants a kiss?

14:31.830 --> 14:33.206
(together)

14:31.830 --> 14:33.206
Ew.

14:34.833 --> 14:39.295
[chuckles]

14:34.833 --> 14:39.295
What's the matter?

14:34.833 --> 14:39.295
Doofy Danny got a boo-boo?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.548
You threw the ball at my head

14:39.337 --> 14:41.548
when I wasn't looking.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.091
Oh, well, you're looking now.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.760
Made you flinch.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.764
Hey, I, uh, like your hair.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.559
- Thanks.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.559
- Who cuts it, Roto-Rooter?

14:55.353 --> 14:58.939
- Oh, yeah?

14:55.353 --> 14:58.939
- Good comeback.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.695
Is that your head,

15:00.441 --> 15:03.695
or did your neck blow a bubble?

15:05.946 --> 15:09.283
Hey, thank you,

15:05.946 --> 15:09.283
thank you. Cut it out.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.748
Where'd you get

15:11.578 --> 15:14.748
all those great jokes?

15:14.789 --> 15:16.875
This book,

15:14.789 --> 15:16.875
"A Thousand and One Insults."

15:16.916 --> 15:18.125
Pretty groovy, huh?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.671
Hey, one at a time.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.675
There's the kid

15:23.464 --> 15:25.675
who was picking on me.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.010
That's it.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.010
I'm calling your parents.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.970
- But--

15:28.052 --> 15:29.970
- Wait, Miss Borland.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.057
That boy's lying.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.057
Joseph has been a perfect angel.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.934
Tanner's the liar.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.895
That's not possible.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.980
Daniel Tanner's never been

15:36.936 --> 15:39.980
in trouble a day in his life.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.735
Let's you and I visit

15:41.274 --> 15:43.735
the principal, Sheldon.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.697
(together)

15:45.986 --> 15:47.697
Sheldon?

15:47.739 --> 15:49.073
[laughing]

15:50.408 --> 15:52.577
Thanks, man.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.577
You saved my life.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.538
- You saved me first.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.538
- We saved each other.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.582
That means we're soul brothers.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.042
To make it official,

15:57.624 --> 16:00.042
we each have to bury

16:00.084 --> 16:02.503
something real important to us.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.631
Bury something?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.674
Won't we get dirty?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.426
It's okay,

16:06.716 --> 16:08.426
I'll be careful.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.595
Good. Let's do the soul shake.

16:19.145 --> 16:23.316
Until you learn to stop chasing

16:19.145 --> 16:23.316
the girls, Jesse Katsopolis..

16:25.526 --> 16:28.696
...you're gonna sit

16:25.526 --> 16:28.696
right here with me.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.032
Have mercy.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.746
I remember that teacher.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.957
I used to have fantasies

16:36.788 --> 16:38.957
about Miss Borland dancing

16:38.998 --> 16:41.584
on "Laugh-In" with sock it

16:38.998 --> 16:41.584
to me painted on her tummy.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.132
Sorry. Anyway.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.132
That was a beautiful story, man

16:48.174 --> 16:50.426
you guys were there

16:48.174 --> 16:50.426
for each other.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.428
<i>Were</i> there for each other.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.181
I should have

16:52.470 --> 16:55.181
let Sheldon cream you.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.600
Come on, guys, don't you

16:55.222 --> 16:57.600
realize how lucky you are?

16:57.642 --> 16:59.811
I mean, I wish I had one

16:57.642 --> 16:59.811
good friend all these years.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.689
You have history. You guys

16:59.853 --> 17:02.689
buried something together.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.273
You're soul brothers.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.859
All in the past.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.735
I'm gonna dig up that box

17:05.900 --> 17:07.735
we buried

17:07.777 --> 17:09.487
'cause I don't want

17:07.777 --> 17:09.487
my stuff resting next to yours

17:09.529 --> 17:11.071
for all eternity.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.826
Well, I'm going with you

17:12.573 --> 17:14.826
because I want my stuff too

17:14.868 --> 17:16.953
and I don't remember

17:14.868 --> 17:16.953
where we buried it.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.580
Well, that just says it all.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.380
Miss Borland. I wonder

17:23.877 --> 17:27.380
if I still have her number.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.801
Sorry, Michelle,

17:29.173 --> 17:31.801
but you can't live here.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.845
Now, go back to your room.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.768
No, this is my room.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.768
You live with D.J. now.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.730
Michelle, don't listen to her.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.730
Go back to your room.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.105
What a day?

17:47.191 --> 17:50.236
Hi, Steph. Hi, honey.

17:50.277 --> 17:54.032
- Your boyfriend's here.

17:50.277 --> 17:54.032
- He is not my boyfriend.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.450
All I did was teach him

17:54.073 --> 17:56.450
how to subtract.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.077
You hypnotized him with oranges

17:58.118 --> 18:01.121
and you put him

17:58.118 --> 18:01.121
in a love trance.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.249
Alright. Enough of this.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.249
Everybody step into my room.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.377
We're gonna play a game of

18:03.290 --> 18:06.377
Junior Love Connection. Come on.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.129
I'd rather play Divorce Court.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.470
Michelle, what are you doing?

18:13.092 --> 18:16.470
Don't read my mail.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.599
That's personal.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.599
What am I saying?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.185
Alright. Come on, now. You go

18:19.640 --> 18:23.185
to your own little room, okay?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.312
What room?

18:25.354 --> 18:28.691
Oh! First she reads my mail,

18:25.354 --> 18:28.691
then she gives me lip.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.193
Come on, get out of here.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.237
Alright. D.J., Harry, come here.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.949
Now, D.J., as nicely

18:33.279 --> 18:35.949
as you can tell Harry

18:35.990 --> 18:37.366
how you really feel about him.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.286
Kid, you don't have a prayer.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.582
Nicer, huh?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.043
Look, Harry,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.043
don't blow a good thing.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.922
You already have a great girl

18:47.085 --> 18:50.922
right here, Stephanie Tanner.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.800
Sorry, chief. Forgive me?

18:53.841 --> 18:55.259
In your dreams.

18:56.761 --> 19:01.557
What Harry is trying to say is,

18:56.761 --> 19:01.557
I've made a big mistake.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.810
The biggest mistake of my life.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.647
Come on, chief. Don't forget

19:03.851 --> 19:07.647
the good old days. Kindergarten.

19:07.688 --> 19:12.693
Please, I'm begging you.

19:07.688 --> 19:12.693
Take me back. Take me back.

19:13.736 --> 19:17.448
Oh, Harry, I forgive you.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.994
Oh, I'm so happy. Shake.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.746
There you go.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.290
Okay, you're my boyfriend again.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.251
Great. Aw.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.251
What was that for?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.837
You're it!

19:34.090 --> 19:35.716
Love is weird.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.428
Trust me, babe.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.428
It gets a lot weirder.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.974
Danny, come on, you dig slower

19:39.470 --> 19:42.974
than you play basketball.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.559
There goes that glacier again.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.814
You think you can do better?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.814
Here. You dig.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.067
Okay. I hit something.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
I don't believe this.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.823
- Wow.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.823
- This is it.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.533
Oh, man.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
It's my old Giants cap.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.293

20:12.712 --> 20:14.088
What's this?

20:15.422 --> 20:19.301
That's the pledge.

20:15.422 --> 20:19.301

20:43.576 --> 20:46.620
this pledge, didn't we?

It's amazing.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.875

20:50.917 --> 20:52.877
Man, we did everything together.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.921

20:56.214 --> 20:59.050
Yeah, but...Joey..

21:00.176 --> 21:01.343
it's not the same.

21:02.636 --> 21:06.390
I feel really stupid

21:02.636 --> 21:06.390
saying this, but, uh..

21:06.432 --> 21:09.602
...ever since you and Jesse

21:06.432 --> 21:09.602
became good buddies..

21:09.643 --> 21:10.978
...and now you're partners..

21:12.271 --> 21:16.567
...I don't know,

21:12.271 --> 21:16.567
I feel...left out.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.653
Is that what this is all about?

21:19.695 --> 21:22.281
Why didn't you just

21:19.695 --> 21:22.281
tell me this in the first place?

21:22.322 --> 21:24.366
I didn't want you

21:22.322 --> 21:24.366
to get the wrong idea.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.953
I'm glad

21:33.834 --> 21:35.044
your best friend

21:35.086 --> 21:36.921

21:35.086 --> 21:36.921
be your best friend.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.551

21:42.593 --> 21:45.096
No. Yes, you have.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.849
But you had a good reason.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.143
Danny, I'm sorry,

21:48.891 --> 21:50.143
I've been taking

21:50.184 --> 21:51.644
our friendship for granted.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.105

22:10.037 --> 22:13.207
Yeah, by then,

22:10.037 --> 22:13.207
