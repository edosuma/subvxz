00:02.025 --> 00:04.526
So, you know in horror movies
when the girl's like,

00:04.595 --> 00:06.968
"Oh, my god.
There's something in the basement."

00:07.037 --> 00:08.904
"Let me just run down there
in my underwear

00:08.989 --> 00:10.622
and see what's going on
in the dark."

00:10.690 --> 00:12.408
And you're like,
"What is your problem?

00:12.492 --> 00:14.410
Call the police."
And she's like, "Okay,"

00:14.494 --> 00:16.996
but it's too late, because
she's already getting murdered?

00:17.047 --> 00:20.165
Well, uh, my story's
kind of like that.

00:21.716 --> 00:23.368
<i>It's a surprise for Spencer.</i>

00:23.420 --> 00:24.720
I'm just gonna walk in,
and I'm gonna

00:24.804 --> 00:26.005
drop my coat on the ground.

00:26.556 --> 00:27.973
<i>He says he has this fantasy</i>

00:28.041 --> 00:30.476
that I'm a stripper
with a heart of gold

00:30.543 --> 00:32.728
and he's helping me
put myself through college.

00:33.612 --> 00:35.147
He didn't say the college part,
did he?

00:35.198 --> 00:38.516
Um, no. I wanted to create a
three-dimensional sex character.

00:38.567 --> 00:39.151
<i>Really?</i>

00:39.202 --> 00:41.069
<i>What's your stripper name?</i>

00:42.153 --> 00:43.739
Rebecca Johnson.

00:43.823 --> 00:46.407
Your stripper name's
Rebecca Johnson?

00:46.492 --> 00:48.076
Boobies Johnson.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.627
Two Boobs Johnson.

00:49.695 --> 00:52.714
Look at you, in the back
of a cab, totally naked.

00:52.798 --> 00:54.883
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

00:58.888 --> 01:01.139
Hello.

01:01.206 --> 01:02.707
I came home early.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.259
Jess! What...

01:04.343 --> 01:07.095
Who's Jess?

01:07.179 --> 01:10.431

02:06.338 --> 02:07.639
You know what's funny?

02:07.706 --> 02:09.723
When I saw your ad
on Craigslist,

02:09.792 --> 02:12.410
I thought you were women.

02:12.461 --> 02:14.445
(laughter)
We're all... that's...

02:14.496 --> 02:15.863
Why would you think that?
That's crazy.

02:15.931 --> 02:17.048
I mean, what...

02:17.115 --> 02:19.133
Schmidt wrote the ad.
Oh, I guess,

02:19.218 --> 02:20.802
it was something about
the words you used.

02:20.886 --> 02:25.790
It was like, uh, like,
"sun-soaked" and "beige-y."

02:25.841 --> 02:27.926
(laughter)

02:27.977 --> 02:28.810
What are you doing?

02:29.862 --> 02:31.012
What about these?

02:31.096 --> 02:32.296
These look beige-y to you?

02:32.348 --> 02:33.932
Sorry.

02:33.983 --> 02:34.999
I'm his trainer, so, uh,

02:35.067 --> 02:35.984
it's kind of the house

02:36.068 --> 02:37.185
that Coach built right here.

02:37.269 --> 02:38.302
What are we
looking at here?

02:38.354 --> 02:39.287
That's baby smooth.

02:39.355 --> 02:40.605
This is LLS.

02:40.656 --> 02:41.706
Ladies Love Schmidt.

02:41.774 --> 02:43.908
What?! What did you just say?

02:43.976 --> 02:45.743
Go put a dollar
in the jar right now.

02:45.811 --> 02:47.261
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Now.

02:47.329 --> 02:48.479
Damn it.

02:48.530 --> 02:49.664
LLS?

02:49.748 --> 02:51.032
What is wrong
with you?

02:51.116 --> 02:53.551
This place is beautiful.

02:53.619 --> 02:54.802
Got so much light.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.488
Spencer hated light.

02:57.539 --> 02:58.923
It's hard to say his name.

02:58.991 --> 02:59.824
SCHMIDT:
It's okay.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.442
Nick knows. He got dumped.

03:01.510 --> 03:02.794
(scoffs):
Dumped.

03:02.845 --> 03:04.495
Yeah, I got dumped.

03:04.546 --> 03:06.264
I can't hear you! That means
we're not breaking up!

03:06.331 --> 03:07.765
Yes, we're
breaking up.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.183
- No! La-la-la-la-la!
- I'm breaking up with you.

03:09.268 --> 03:10.184
I need some
time away...

03:10.252 --> 03:12.720
Yeah, I got dumped.

03:12.805 --> 03:14.105
She dumped me.

03:14.172 --> 03:15.373
And I'm over it.

03:15.441 --> 03:16.975
Okay, it was
six months ago, guys.

03:17.026 --> 03:18.843
Get past it.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.645
I don't even know why we're
still talking about it.

03:20.713 --> 03:22.346
Why's everybody looking at me?

03:26.617 --> 03:28.403
You know what,
I want to live here.

03:28.487 --> 03:30.538
Actually, I-I still
have some questions.

03:30.622 --> 03:32.857
I mean, like, no offense, you
know, but we barely know you.

03:32.908 --> 03:33.908
Yeah, okay, yeah.

03:33.993 --> 03:36.260
So, um, full disclosure,

03:36.328 --> 03:39.330
I'm kind of emotional right now
'cause of the breakup,

03:39.381 --> 03:41.582
so I'll probably be
watching <i>Dirty Dancing</i>

03:41.667 --> 03:43.001
at least six
or seven times.

03:43.052 --> 03:44.135
A day.

03:44.202 --> 03:45.720
Um, I'm a teacher,

03:45.804 --> 03:47.805
so I bring home a lot
of popsicle sticks,

03:47.873 --> 03:49.590
stuff like that.

03:49.658 --> 03:52.143
Also, I like to sing
to myself, a lot.

03:54.263 --> 03:56.764

All her friends are models.

03:59.651 --> 04:01.552
Uh, how soon can you move in?

04:01.603 --> 04:03.021
- Actually, Schmidt, slow up.
- Not happening.

04:03.072 --> 04:04.772
Okay, uh, could you
give us a second?

04:04.857 --> 04:06.908
I just got to... got
to talk to my boys.

04:06.975 --> 04:08.276
"My boys"
is not a thing.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.727
- My bros, okay?
- Okay, douche bag jar.

04:09.778 --> 04:11.162
SCHMIDT:
What? You're my bros.

04:11.229 --> 04:12.113
I'm gonna say yes.

04:12.197 --> 04:13.581

04:13.665 --> 04:15.566
Okay, you guys? Models.

04:15.617 --> 04:17.035
I say no.

04:17.086 --> 04:18.920
I need to be able
to come home from work,

04:19.004 --> 04:20.571
sit on my couch
and let my beans out,

04:20.622 --> 04:21.906
let them breathe.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.541
Nick, it's all
you, buddy.

04:23.592 --> 04:25.176
Well, first let me say,

04:25.243 --> 04:27.345
I think you guys make
some really interesting points,

04:27.412 --> 04:29.514
points that I respect,
but I will say this.

04:29.581 --> 04:31.582
I have lived with a woman--
Caroline, as you guys know--

04:31.633 --> 04:33.134
and so I know
that there are pros

04:33.218 --> 04:34.852
and I know that there
are real cons, guys.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.304
- Nick, you're weak!
- Okay, pro...

04:36.388 --> 04:37.438
they smell nice.

04:37.523 --> 04:38.856
Cons...

04:38.924 --> 04:41.059
every once in a while,
the mood changes

04:41.110 --> 04:42.443
and you're not sure why.

04:42.528 --> 04:44.112
They'll ruin your life
if you let them.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.813
They'll break down
your will to live.

04:45.898 --> 04:47.598
Pros-- they're really
good at folding.

04:47.649 --> 04:49.367
- Make a decision!
- I'm sorry, you know.

04:49.434 --> 04:50.568
But, like, another pro, like...

04:50.619 --> 04:51.769
- Oh, don't do it.
- I'm gonna.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.122

Don't hood me.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.940

what you're talking about.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.458
- Please don't hood me.
- I know what I'm talking about.

04:57.543 --> 04:58.943
Okay.
Pushed him too hard.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.578

07:55.805 --> 07:57.522
Knowing every year
that I will be

07:57.606 --> 07:59.340
going to the Wild Wild West
Charity Auction for Poverty

07:59.391 --> 08:00.441
reminds me that

08:00.509 --> 08:01.559
I'm still a man,

08:01.644 --> 08:03.611
and I can still
motorboat a hot girl

08:03.679 --> 08:06.314
who is also a member
of the Cherokee Nation,

08:06.365 --> 08:09.400
which is not racist,
because it is for a good cause.

08:09.485 --> 08:11.152
JESS: Somebody's in here.
- We're leaving in ten minutes.

08:11.203 --> 08:12.120
Did you shave your legs?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.855
I will now.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.757
Front and backs?

08:15.825 --> 08:17.125
- Yes.
- Thank you.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.543
I'm gonna kill
myself now.

08:18.627 --> 08:19.494
Just call Caroline.
You call her

08:19.545 --> 08:20.995
all the time when you're drunk.

08:21.046 --> 08:22.497
I don't know to what
you are referring.

08:22.548 --> 08:25.667
(Cockney accent):
Hello, Caroline.

08:25.718 --> 08:27.752
I still love you.

08:27.837 --> 08:30.338
So much.

08:30.389 --> 08:33.591
So... much.

08:33.676 --> 08:35.376
I'm not calling her.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.378
Schmidt, I know you really
want to go to this party,

08:37.429 --> 08:39.264
but wouldn't it be better

08:39.347 --> 08:42.900
to find a girl who you really
care about to motorboat?

08:42.985 --> 08:45.887
Then maybe, if
you're super lucky,

08:45.938 --> 08:49.557
you might find a girl who'll
motorboat you right back.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.825
I don't think she knows
what motorboating is.

08:53.028 --> 08:54.829
SCHMIDT:
Jess, we are
leaving in five.

08:54.897 --> 08:55.997
Hey.

08:56.064 --> 08:58.065
Hey, Coach, what's...
(gasps)

08:59.201 --> 09:02.086
Sorry.

09:02.171 --> 09:06.007
Uh, my boss says that I don't
know how to talk to women,

09:06.074 --> 09:07.175
which is ridiculous.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.877
Spin, woman! Spin!

09:08.928 --> 09:10.211
(yells)
I am spinning!

09:10.262 --> 09:12.213
- Go!
- You're so mean!

09:12.264 --> 09:13.965
I'm not mean, I'm
trying to help you!

09:14.049 --> 09:15.767
(sobbing)
I'm trying
to help you!

09:15.851 --> 09:18.920
So I was wondering if you could,
uh, help me out with that.

09:18.971 --> 09:20.939
Sure, sure, absolutely.

09:21.023 --> 09:24.309
Um, well, first of all,

09:24.393 --> 09:26.477
maybe think about what women
like to talk about,

09:26.562 --> 09:28.980
you know, like...
use me for practice.

09:29.064 --> 09:31.933
All right, um...
(clears throat)

09:31.984 --> 09:33.651
Shopping.

09:33.736 --> 09:36.621
Is that fun... for you guys?

09:36.705 --> 09:38.539
Yeah. Shopping's fun.

09:38.607 --> 09:41.075
Uh, the other day,
I bought a pair of jeggings.

09:41.126 --> 09:44.445
They look like jeans,
but they're really leggings.

09:44.496 --> 09:47.498
Uh, uh...

09:47.583 --> 09:50.084
You... I...

09:51.620 --> 09:53.304
Who cares?!

09:53.389 --> 09:54.422
Sorry.

09:55.473 --> 09:57.842
Um, good job.

09:57.927 --> 10:00.895
A couple things
you could work on.

10:00.963 --> 10:02.096
Uh, one,

10:02.147 --> 10:03.765
lowering your voice.

10:03.816 --> 10:05.149
(whispers):
Right on.

10:05.234 --> 10:06.633
Um, two, listening.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.854
Uh, three, rage.

10:09.939 --> 10:11.138
Absolutely.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.473
Um, four...

10:12.524 --> 10:14.575
Your hair is on fire.

10:14.643 --> 10:17.345
(sizzling)

10:19.365 --> 10:21.248
Beers and a rosé.

10:21.816 --> 10:25.202
Pink wine makes me slutty.

10:25.838 --> 10:28.289
Whoa, cute guy alert.

10:28.340 --> 10:31.009
(imitating cartoon
sound effects)

10:31.093 --> 10:32.827
SCHMIDT:
Okay, Jess, game time.

10:32.878 --> 10:34.379
Let's do this.

10:34.463 --> 10:35.430
You want to forget
about Spencer,

10:35.497 --> 10:36.497
you're gonna have to

10:36.548 --> 10:40.018
do some very, very bad things...

10:40.102 --> 10:42.003
with that man right over there.

10:42.054 --> 10:43.554
How bad?

10:43.639 --> 10:45.172
Real bad, Jess.

10:45.724 --> 10:46.690
Real bad.

10:46.775 --> 10:48.676
Like a make out sesh,
no tops?

10:49.227 --> 10:52.030
Okay, this is what,
this is what's gonna happen.

10:52.114 --> 10:54.816
You're gonna go over there and
you're gonna stand next to him

10:54.867 --> 10:55.850
and you're gonna smile.

10:57.536 --> 10:58.953
You're not gonna smile
like that.

11:00.521 --> 11:02.789
You look like
a hungry badger.

11:03.742 --> 11:04.742
Stop that.

11:04.827 --> 11:06.210
Okay, I got this, I got this.

11:06.295 --> 11:07.662
You-you got it. Just
go make it happen.

11:07.713 --> 11:08.796
COACH:
Game on! Grind it out!

11:08.864 --> 11:10.048
SCHMIDT: Go do it!
Grind it out!

11:10.132 --> 11:11.365
(laughs)

11:14.553 --> 11:16.037
Hey, sailor.

11:18.307 --> 11:19.757
Oh, all right.
All right.

11:19.842 --> 11:20.708
That's okay. Maybe
he didn't hear that.

11:20.759 --> 11:21.726
You can come back from that.

11:21.810 --> 11:22.727
You're all good.

11:22.811 --> 11:25.430
Holy Schmidt! It's Schmidt!

11:25.514 --> 11:27.648
Oh, it is all about
the Benjamin!

11:27.716 --> 11:29.017
- That's right.
- What's up?!

11:29.068 --> 11:30.234
- What's up, man?
- All right.

11:30.319 --> 11:31.319
P-Funk, what's up, dude?

11:31.886 --> 11:32.820
This is Coach.

11:32.887 --> 11:33.887
What's up, Coach?

11:39.394 --> 11:40.894
You like parties?

11:40.946 --> 11:42.029
(chuckles)
Don't talk to me.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.531
Yeah, okay.

11:43.582 --> 11:44.832
You know who likes
to party hard, right?

11:44.899 --> 11:46.400
Yeah. So you coming on Saturday?

11:46.451 --> 11:48.402
I hear there's gonna be
some fine ladies there.

11:48.453 --> 11:49.954
Ah, maybe, yeah. I heard

11:50.038 --> 11:51.372
it's not gonna be
that good this year. No?

11:51.423 --> 11:52.540
Are you not on the list?

11:52.591 --> 11:53.757
Man, I'm on the list.

11:53.842 --> 11:54.792
- You know that.
- Ah.

11:54.876 --> 11:55.926
That sucks, man.

11:57.011 --> 11:58.261
Keep your head up, all right?

11:58.346 --> 11:59.430
All right, player.

11:59.514 --> 12:00.914
Do your thing, man.
It was good seeing you.

12:00.966 --> 12:01.682
Take the
sleazy, man.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.917
All right, man.
P-Funk always.

12:03.969 --> 12:06.420
- Nick, please.
- Why are you friends with those guys?

12:06.471 --> 12:08.439
Nick, please get me in the
party. I'm begging you. Please.

12:08.523 --> 12:09.807
No, I'm not calling Caroline.

12:09.891 --> 12:11.008
Do you know what a cute
cowboy I am?

12:11.076 --> 12:12.142
Do you have any idea?

12:14.112 --> 12:16.480
Well, I guess
I can't hide my crazy.

12:16.565 --> 12:18.932
I don't think
you're trying that hard.

12:18.984 --> 12:22.236
Well, I've never really been
great at this stuff, so...

12:22.287 --> 12:25.489
♪ What if God was one of us ♪

12:25.574 --> 12:27.825
Make it stop!

12:28.409 --> 12:30.160
♪ Just a slob
like one of us... ♪

12:31.245 --> 12:32.296
Look at us.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.780
Couple of losers.

12:33.832 --> 12:36.283
We both got dumped. Geesh.

12:36.334 --> 12:37.784
I'm fine.

12:37.836 --> 12:39.587
Six months ago, so...

12:39.638 --> 12:41.121
Do you know why she dumped you?

12:41.172 --> 12:42.673
I mean, she must have hurt you
pretty bad.

12:42.757 --> 12:44.174
No, no. It made no difference
to me.

12:44.259 --> 12:45.809
I just wanted
to set her trash cans on fire.

12:45.894 --> 12:47.261
So you were always just, like,

12:47.312 --> 12:49.013
wondering, like, "What was it?

12:49.097 --> 12:50.464
Was there something
I could have done differently?"

12:52.567 --> 12:54.902
You know what happens to people
who keep it all inside.

12:54.969 --> 12:58.238
They get old, and they get sad,
and they get weird,

12:58.306 --> 12:59.857
and then you're the old man,
and you're yelling at the kids

12:59.924 --> 13:01.475
who are running
across your yard.

13:01.526 --> 13:02.977
And you're telling them,

13:03.028 --> 13:05.579
"Don't run across my yard.
My life's filled with regret."

13:06.447 --> 13:07.498
You know, you
can't just

13:08.582 --> 13:09.483
pretend like it didn't happen.

13:09.534 --> 13:12.169
Or I could pretend
to be more like you,

13:12.253 --> 13:15.155
Jess, and live
on a sparkly rainbow

13:15.206 --> 13:18.825
drive a unicorn around,
and just sing all the time.

13:18.877 --> 13:21.011
Yeah, I think you should
sing all the time.

13:21.096 --> 13:23.097
No, I was being mean.
I'm not gonna do that, Jess.

13:23.164 --> 13:25.015
Why not? It's fun.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.667
Because I have a penis.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.269
♪ My name is Nick,
I have a penis ♪

13:29.337 --> 13:32.839
♪ And I'm not gonna let
any feelings out. ♪

13:32.891 --> 13:35.008
Okay, Jess,
your left boob is resting

13:35.060 --> 13:36.677
on a plate of chicken wings.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.679
Yeah. I know.

13:40.231 --> 13:41.398
Hey.

13:41.483 --> 13:43.317
I'm Peter.

13:43.385 --> 13:45.486
What are you drinking?

13:45.537 --> 13:47.237
Oh, I'll have
another pink wine.

13:47.322 --> 13:48.872
PETER:
I like your glasses.

13:48.957 --> 13:50.457
JESS:
They help me see.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.077
(laughing)

13:53.161 --> 13:55.245
She's doing all right, hmm?

13:55.330 --> 13:56.714
Schmidt stain!

13:56.798 --> 13:58.699
Hey, man, I was thinking,

13:58.750 --> 14:00.534
it's probably better that
you don't come to the party.

14:00.585 --> 14:02.202
That means more breasts for me.

14:02.253 --> 14:03.220
(laughs)

14:03.304 --> 14:05.089
You better step down, son.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.557
You're taking this whole thing
too far. I'm ser...

14:06.641 --> 14:08.008
Hold me back, Coach.
I'm-I'm ser...

14:08.059 --> 14:09.760
Hold me back. Hold me back!

14:09.844 --> 14:12.045
- Coach, would you <i>please</i>
hold me back?     - No.

14:12.097 --> 14:13.814
Schmidt, we're going
to the party. Relax.

14:13.881 --> 14:15.215
Nice. See you there, Schmitty.

14:15.266 --> 14:16.734
Ah, totally, bro.

14:16.818 --> 14:18.318
Yeah, I texted Caroline.

14:18.386 --> 14:19.520
You texted Caroline?

14:19.571 --> 14:21.221
It's no big deal.
It's behind me.

14:21.272 --> 14:22.723
It's in the past, so...

14:22.774 --> 14:24.908
Thank you.
I love you, bro.

14:24.993 --> 14:27.227
Yeah, there it is.

14:27.278 --> 14:28.996
- Did you just kiss my arm a little?
- You bet I did. It felt right.

14:29.063 --> 14:30.664
So, I'll see you
tomorrow, sailor.

14:30.732 --> 14:34.334
Yeah, cool.
Call... Cool.

14:34.402 --> 14:36.236
What's happening
tomorrow, sailor?

14:36.287 --> 14:38.255
You know what?
You guys were totally right.

14:38.339 --> 14:40.457
I talked in short sentences,
I didn't sing,

14:40.542 --> 14:43.410
I laughed, I smiled,
I said I needed rebound sex,

14:43.461 --> 14:46.130
and it totally worked.
He asked me out.

14:46.814 --> 14:47.848

15:04.282 --> 15:05.482
All right,
should we tell her?

15:05.567 --> 15:07.100
I think we let her
have her moment.

15:19.971 --> 15:21.171
JESS:
I'm okay.

15:21.239 --> 15:23.140
What, are you
a model or something?

15:23.208 --> 15:25.075
Yeah.

15:25.143 --> 15:28.679
Yes. Mostly print
right now, so...

15:28.747 --> 15:30.130
What is it, Cece?

15:30.198 --> 15:32.066
Cecilia?

<i>Checilia?</i>

Tell me, what are
your hopes and dreams?

15:36.054 --> 15:37.521
You know, are you warm?
I'm a little...

15:37.589 --> 15:38.955
(laughs)
I'm a little warm right now.

15:39.007 --> 15:40.841
- Don't, Schmidt.
- All right.

15:40.925 --> 15:42.309
Oh, yeah.
There it is.

15:42.394 --> 15:43.644
(inhales deeply)

15:43.728 --> 15:45.312
Please put your shirt back on.

15:45.397 --> 15:47.564
Please don't make me laugh
at you.

15:47.632 --> 15:49.349
Can I hit you up
with some tea?

15:49.417 --> 15:51.485
A little herb tea.
(moans)

15:51.569 --> 15:53.136
SCHMIDT:
Oh, my God.

15:53.188 --> 15:54.971
How good is that?
For real? What?

15:55.023 --> 15:56.740
Little p-mint tea?

15:56.808 --> 15:58.141
Yum, right?

15:58.193 --> 16:00.360
Hot, sweet.

16:00.428 --> 16:02.029
Little tea bag action.

16:03.131 --> 16:05.499
And, I wasn't...

16:05.583 --> 16:07.017
I wasn't talking about...

16:07.085 --> 16:08.535
There it is.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.120
Douche bag.

16:10.171 --> 16:11.872
Listen to me, you guys.

16:11.956 --> 16:13.841
Jess is by far
the best person that I know,

16:13.925 --> 16:16.460
so, if you guys let anything
happen to her, I'm gonna

16:16.511 --> 16:18.929
come here and crazy murder you.

16:20.398 --> 16:22.599
I'm gonna be honest with you.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.335
I did not hear a word
that you just said,

16:25.403 --> 16:26.970
'cause I can kind of see
your party hats right now.

16:27.038 --> 16:29.556
- There you go.
- Jess!

16:29.641 --> 16:31.024
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, man...

16:31.109 --> 16:33.110
Why are you
talking like this?

16:35.846 --> 16:37.565
I fell off my heels.

16:37.632 --> 16:40.067
Okay, all right.
Now, come on.

16:40.151 --> 16:42.202
- Get up.
- Oh, what am I doing?

16:42.287 --> 16:44.071
I can't go on a date.
What if it's horrible?

16:44.155 --> 16:46.523
What if I have nothing
to talk about?

16:46.574 --> 16:47.958
Then you go to the bathroom,
and you call me,

16:48.025 --> 16:49.710
and you tell me all about it.

16:49.794 --> 16:52.279
Maybe I just shouldn't go.

16:52.347 --> 16:53.997
Babe, you got hurt.

16:54.048 --> 16:55.666
That doesn't mean
you stop trying.

16:55.717 --> 16:57.334
Okay?

16:57.385 --> 16:58.635
Yeah, okay.
Okay, let's go.

16:58.703 --> 16:59.870
Come on.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.007
(sighs)

17:04.058 --> 17:05.976
You got to take off
those overalls.

17:06.042 --> 17:08.211
I was going for, like, a...

17:08.262 --> 17:11.064
like, a hot farmer's daughter
kind of thing.

17:11.148 --> 17:15.102
You know, like, "Oh,
I'm going to go milk my cows

17:15.185 --> 17:17.104
with my bucket."

17:17.188 --> 17:18.605
Take 'em off.

17:18.690 --> 17:21.558
Okay. What am I gonna wear?

17:32.704 --> 17:33.787
Wow!

17:35.323 --> 17:37.257
Thanks, Coach.

17:37.842 --> 17:40.511
(beatboxing)

17:40.578 --> 17:42.296
And then she
does that.

17:42.380 --> 17:45.299
I'm gonna text him, tell
him I'm headed over.

17:45.383 --> 17:47.050
Wait. Have you been texting him?

17:47.101 --> 17:48.302
Is that bad?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.588
No. It's nice.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.274
Have a good night.

17:54.359 --> 17:57.060
This is gonna be great.

17:57.111 --> 17:59.746
SCHMIDT:
Coach, you don't look anything
like an Indian.

17:59.814 --> 18:01.932
Look, man, I got your back.
You got to have mine, too.

18:01.983 --> 18:03.400
Coach, I got
your back.

18:03.451 --> 18:05.068
No, Nick. I want
to hear it from him.

18:05.119 --> 18:06.937
Coach, what sort of
Indian wears bike shorts?

18:06.988 --> 18:09.289
Excuse me. Is, uh...? Caroline.
I'm looking for Caroline.

18:09.374 --> 18:10.908
We're supposed to
be on some list.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.326
Hey, Nick.

18:13.711 --> 18:14.828
Thanks.

18:15.913 --> 18:17.914
Sorry I'm wearing
this stupid thing.

18:18.082 --> 18:19.967
Schmidt made me do it.

18:20.051 --> 18:22.586
- Thank you so much for getting us in.
- Yeah. No problem.

18:22.637 --> 18:25.889
- Maybe to pay me back you can
stop prank calling me.  - What?

18:25.957 --> 18:28.425
(Cockney accent):
Uh... "Hello... Caroline.

18:28.476 --> 18:30.627
I still loves you, I do."

18:30.678 --> 18:31.929
Yeah, you got to
figure that out.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.230
Some crazy person's
calling you.

18:33.297 --> 18:34.464
(laughs)
You look nice.

18:34.515 --> 18:36.099
It's good to see you.

18:36.150 --> 18:40.354
Um, I-I think I'm almost
finished out here if you...

18:40.438 --> 18:43.323
Do you want to go
grab a drink?

18:43.908 --> 18:45.475
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:45.526 --> 18:47.077
Sure. Yeah. Let's

18:47.144 --> 18:49.363
- You and I just get a drink.
- Let's get a drink.

18:49.447 --> 18:50.447
- Just be normal about it.
- Okay.

18:50.498 --> 18:51.698
Actually, hold on.
I'm sorry.

18:51.783 --> 18:53.500
I just... I have
to ask you something

18:53.585 --> 18:56.420
so that one day I'm not an
old man filled with regret.

18:56.487 --> 18:58.589
But why did you dump me?

18:58.656 --> 19:01.825
Um... Do... Okay.

19:01.876 --> 19:05.295
Are we doing this here,
like, now?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.564
Yeah.

19:07.831 --> 19:09.216
Why did you dump me?

19:09.500 --> 19:13.520
Um... honestly,

19:13.605 --> 19:15.973
I... I didn't even realize

19:16.057 --> 19:18.942
that you cared about me
until we broke up.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.313
Okay.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.366
Let's get that drink.

19:26.451 --> 19:27.651
BENJAMIN:
Get along, little doggy.

19:27.702 --> 19:30.737
Well, howdy there,
muchachos.

19:30.822 --> 19:32.239
NICK:
Hey,

19:32.323 --> 19:33.991
where's Jess?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.043
Oh, dude, she texted
me seven times.

19:36.127 --> 19:38.462
Like, long ones.
I just want to hook up.

19:38.529 --> 19:42.215
So, is she waiting for you
to show up, or did you call her?

19:42.300 --> 19:44.584
Yeah, that's what
I did. I called her.

19:44.669 --> 19:47.304
(laughter)

19:47.371 --> 19:49.640
See you inside, Schmidt.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.226
CAROLINE:
Nick?

19:53.311 --> 19:54.728
Want to get that drink?

19:57.649 --> 20:00.350
No. I got to go help
a friend, Caroline.

20:01.101 --> 20:03.236
No, no, no, no, no.
Guys, this is

20:03.321 --> 20:04.188
the party of the year,
you guys.

20:04.239 --> 20:05.722
This is our night.
This is our night!

20:05.774 --> 20:06.907
I'm going with Nick, man.
You coming?

20:06.992 --> 20:08.409
I thought you guys
were my boys!

20:08.493 --> 20:11.862
"My boys" is not a
thing, Schmidt. Stop.

20:11.913 --> 20:14.081
COACH:
We're coming, Jess!

20:25.927 --> 20:27.761
Oh!

20:36.521 --> 20:40.140
Do you have anything else
that is free,

20:40.224 --> 20:42.025
but also has bread in it?

20:42.093 --> 20:43.944
Because the-the... the, like,
good bread I ate, and the...

20:44.028 --> 20:45.779
All that's left is, like, a...

20:45.863 --> 20:47.947
It's, like... it's kind of
like a health bread.

20:48.032 --> 20:49.282
I'm sorry.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.535
We're going to have to ask you
to give up the table.

20:53.938 --> 20:57.824
Um, can I please just stay
just a little bit longer?

20:58.409 --> 20:59.826
NICK:
We're here.

21:00.010 --> 21:00.777
Yup.

21:00.828 --> 21:02.412
We're here, Jess.
We're here.

21:02.463 --> 21:03.797
We're here
for the date.

21:03.881 --> 21:05.298
- Date thing.
- Whew.

21:05.383 --> 21:06.383
You're all
on a date?

21:06.450 --> 21:07.334
NICK:
Yeah.

21:07.402 --> 21:08.835
We, uh... we're her boyfriends.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.637
We are reverse Mormons.

21:10.722 --> 21:12.172
- One man just isn't enough for her.
- Okay.

21:14.175 --> 21:16.643
Hey, Jess,
that guy was a jerk.

21:16.728 --> 21:19.295
- Yeah.
- He was a clown.

21:19.347 --> 21:24.101
You guys missed your party
to come here and... see me?

21:24.152 --> 21:27.137
Yeah. We, uh...
we care about you.

21:27.688 --> 21:28.772
We like you.

21:28.823 --> 21:30.490
(crying):
That's so nice.

21:30.575 --> 21:32.025
What is that?
Don't start crying.

21:32.110 --> 21:33.493
Come on.

21:33.578 --> 21:34.995
It's cool. It's very, very cool.

21:35.079 --> 21:36.363
NICK: Come on, Jess.
Come on.

21:36.447 --> 21:37.814
- Please?
- Stop it!

21:37.865 --> 21:38.749
- Coach.
- All right.

21:38.816 --> 21:40.167
It's okay. Hey.
