<i> Really?</i>
<i>When it comes to Milk and her,</i>

<i>You weren't expecting that.</i>

<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:59.751
<i> Well, um, my parents</i>
<i>actually came up on the</i> <i>untucked</i>
<i>screen today.</i>

01:59.753 --> 02:02.921
<i>It was just kind of a hard</i>
<i>moment 'cause, like, the girls</i>
<i>just, like, kind of jumped in</i>

02:02.923 --> 02:04.756
<i>immediately and started talking</i>
<i>over me.</i>

<i>know that they support me 100%.</i>

<i> I think your parents are</i>
<i>absolutely lovely.</i>
<i>The only thing I disagree with</i>

02:14.201 --> 02:17.402
<i>is that they think you're gonna</i>
<i>win.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

02:17.404 --> 02:21.773
<i> [Sighs]</i>
<i>I feel hurt that you guys would</i>
<i>take advantage of this moment</i>

02:21.775 --> 02:27.045
<i>for yourselves because this was</i>
<i>about me.</i>
<i>It was hard for me, 'cause I</i>

02:27.047 --> 02:31.483
<i>needed to take that moment to</i>
<i>just breathe and really take it</i>
<i>in before I-I could speak, and</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:34.753
<i>i just--I felt like I didn't</i>
<i>really get that.</i>
<i>Bianca's like, "well, I agree</i>

02:34.755 --> 02:39.258
<i>with everything, but you're not</i>

<i> Bitch, it was a fucking joke.</i>

02:39.260 --> 02:40.559
<i>Take all that weepy bullshit,</i>

02:40.561 --> 02:41.860
<i>take all that attention that you</i>

<i>Snatch Game!</i>
<i>[Contestants exclaiming]</i>

<i> I am so fucking excited.</i>

04:57.665 --> 05:01.366
<i>This is the reason why I came</i>
<i>into this competition, is to</i>
<i>snatch Snatch Game and snatch</i>

05:01.368 --> 05:07.406
<i>the title.</i>
<i> Now, you'll need to bust out</i>
<i>your best celebrity</i>

05:07.408 --> 05:14.946
<i>impersonation.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>
<i>And may the best woman win.</i>

05:14.948 --> 05:15.914
<i> Snatch Game is a really</i>

05:15.916 --> 05:17.115
<i>important challenge.</i>

05:17.117 --> 05:18.016
<i>It's one that everybody knows</i>

<i>is coming.</i>

<i>And everybody's kind of waiting</i>
<i>all season to see what you pull</i>
<i>out.</i>

05:23.023 --> 05:28.427
<i>But I don't do impersonations.</i>
<i>That's not ever a part of my</i>
<i>deal.</i>

05:28.429 --> 05:33.432
<i> This challenge is the one</i>
<i>that's gonna separate the</i>
<i>talented from the...Other ones.</i>

05:33.434 --> 05:38.303
<i> What are you going for there,</i>
<i>hon?</i>
<i> Teresa giudice, from Jersey.</i>

05:38.305 --> 05:41.340
<i> Who are you doing, baby?</i>
<i> I'm gonna be Rachel Zoe.</i>
<i> I can see that.</i>

05:41.342 --> 05:45.043
<i> You know, when tay-tay was</i>
<i>her assistant, before she</i>
<i>turned bitch.</i>

05:45.045 --> 05:48.580
<i>I think the key to a good</i>
<i>impersonation is not only</i>
<i>looking like the character,</i>

05:48.582 --> 05:53.085
<i>but speaking in their voice.</i>
<i>[Imitating zoe] "it's maj.</i>
<i>I'm not worried."</i>

05:53.087 --> 05:55.887
<i> Now, who are you doing,</i>
<i>miss Bianca Del Rio?</i>
<i> Can you tell from this</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:58.890
<i>hairdo?</i>
<i> Let's guess.</i>
<i> She's my favorite person</i>

05:58.892 --> 06:00.992
<i>in the world.</i>
<i> I'm just gonna go with</i>
<i>judge Judy.</i>

06:00.994 --> 06:04.696
<i> Judge Judy, ding ding ding!</i>
<i>I love her.</i>
<i>I want to be her.</i>

06:04.698 --> 06:09.234
<i>The reason why I'm choosing</i>
<i>judge Judy is because she's</i>
<i>smart, she's sensible, and she's</i>

06:09.236 --> 06:12.170
<i>a fucking bitch.</i>
<i>I love her.</i>
<i>I watch all the time 'cause</i>

06:12.172 --> 06:15.874
<i>she makes me laugh.</i>
<i> And RuPaul loves her so much.</i>
<i> Oh, she does?</i>

06:15.876 --> 06:21.079
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> So I had no idea that</i> <i>judge</i>
<i>Judy</i> is RuPaul's favorite TV

06:21.081 --> 06:24.783
show.
Heh--pressure?
So it either could be really

06:24.785 --> 06:28.453
good or a hot mess.
Yeah, you could fall flat on
your face and go home.

06:28.455 --> 06:32.557
[Dramatic drumbeat]
[Chuckles sarcastically]
Bianca is a little bit

06:32.559 --> 06:34.760
I haven't seen her at all

06:34.762 --> 06:36.027
sweat in the competition.

06:36.029 --> 06:42.934
And it's interesting seeing her
kind of wriggle a little.
Hello, hello, hello.

06:42.936 --> 06:47.339
[Overlapping greetings]
[Cockney accent] No more fun 'n'
games of the mind.

Adore Delano, darling.
Hi, Ru.

06:50.077 --> 06:54.679
Okay, that is a blonde wig.
Yeah!
I'm doing Anna Nicole Smith.

06:54.681 --> 06:58.550
Anna Nicole Smith.
I love her.
Like, kids had spice girls on

06:58.552 --> 07:02.521
their folders, and I literally
would have, like, the <i>playboy</i>
<i>cutout, 'cause I would steal--</i>

07:02.523 --> 07:06.124
<i>no, really.</i>
<i>I think I identified with the</i>
<i>fact that she was just very</i>

07:06.126 --> 07:09.194
<i>crazy, and she inspires Adore</i>
<i>a lot too.</i>
<i> Can you do a Southern accent</i>

07:09.196 --> 07:11.663
<i>like her?</i>
<i> I can.</i>
<i> Let me hear it.</i>

07:11.665 --> 07:17.836
<i> [Imitating smith] "I was</i>
<i>honored to be in our next</i>

<i> Hi, Ru.</i>
<i> It looks like you're doing</i>
<i>someone older.</i>

07:43.430 --> 07:48.033
<i> It is.</i>
<i>I will be doing Maggie Smith.</i>
<i></i> <i>Downton abbey</i> Maggie Smith.

07:48.035 --> 07:52.704
Yes.
How will you make Maggie
Smith funny?

07:52.706 --> 07:58.343
Well, I think Maggie Smith
is already such a character.
Mm.

07:58.345 --> 08:03.381
And just, sort of, she's been
in the business so long.
Yeah.

08:03.383 --> 08:10.422
Now, you do an English accent?
Um, you know, I don't know
how to do one, if I'm honest.

08:10.424 --> 08:15.660
What other choices were you
mulling over before you settled
on Maggie Smith?

08:15.662 --> 08:19.397
Um, well, I was initially
thinking about one of my
favorite queens from last

08:19.399 --> 08:23.735
season, miss Alyssa Edwards.
Can I see a little bit of
your Alyssa Edwards?

08:23.737 --> 08:29.040
[Smacking]
G-g--
[Choking]

08:29.042 --> 08:32.577
[Clicks tongue]
Wow.
All right.

08:32.579 --> 08:35.881
Well, you've got a lot of
competition.
They're very talented girls

08:35.883 --> 08:39.484
here.
Ru does not seem into my
idea.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.521
I'm shaken.
My confidence is definitely
shaken.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.557
But I, uh...

08:45.559 --> 08:52.163
Coming up...

08:52.165 --> 08:53.098
I'd rather you have low

08:53.100 --> 08:54.199
expectations so I can blow you

08:54.201 --> 08:55.066
away.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.836
Well, you've succeeded.

Snatch Game, where you
impersonate one of your favorite

celebrities.
Laganja, girl.
Hey, mama Ru.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.622
And what's with this
headpiece you have on?
Oh, this old thing?

09:17.624 --> 09:20.659
[Laughs]
So who you gonna do?
I'm going to be playing

09:20.661 --> 09:23.328
Rachel Zoe.
[Imitating zoe] "She's bananas!"
[Laughs]

09:23.330 --> 09:28.433
I know she's got some key
phrasing--"li-ter-a-lly."
And "I die" and "maj!"

09:28.435 --> 09:31.636
Now, are you quick on your
toes?
I'm very quick on my toes.

09:31.638 --> 09:35.674
And I must say, your outfit is
just to <i>die</i> for.
Li-ter-a-lly?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.410
Li-ter-a-lly!
[Laughs] All right.
Get back to work.

09:38.412 --> 09:42.247
Thanks, Ru.
Well, hello, Milk.
Hi.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.551
Who are you going to do?
The chef that brought French
cooking to the American kitchen.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.187
Oh, wow.
[Imitating child] "Julia
child."

09:49.189 --> 09:52.223
So how are you gonna make her
funny?
Um, she's already over the

09:52.225 --> 09:57.996
top because of her size, but I'm
going to bring that over-the-top
sort of personality that--

09:57.998 --> 10:04.703
I-I mean, she wrote a 730-page
book about French cooking,
and, I mean, so she--

10:04.705 --> 10:09.874
I mean, she--she's sm--
she's a smart girl.
Have you seen Snatch Game

10:09.876 --> 10:15.113

What show?
[Bell dings]

Well, you've succeeded.
Well, well, well.

10:23.357 --> 10:29.160
Hello, Mr. RuPaul.
Oh, my goodness, I just saw
the judge's robe right there.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.397
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Judge Judy.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.333
Judge Judy, yes.
Only Judy can judge me.
Exa--[Laughs]

10:35.335 --> 10:38.670
And I'm sure she would.
You know how I love--
I just found out that you

10:38.672 --> 10:43.308
actually love her.
I gotta tell you, I watch
<i>judge Judy</i> every single day.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.811
Are you kidding me?
I've seen every episode.
So, you know, the heat is on

10:46.813 --> 10:52.183
you to pull this off.
You better do my judge Judy
proud.

10:52.185 --> 10:56.755
Fuck.
G-g-g-Gia.
Hi, Ru.

10:56.757 --> 11:00.058
Now, you know Snatch Game.
Yes.
How are you gonna do?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.927
Well, I'll not only be
snatched...
Uh-huh.

11:02.929 --> 11:06.765
But I'm going to do Selena.
Selena.
Yes.

11:06.767 --> 11:10.702
Not Selena Gomez.
No.
Quintanilla.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.972
So s--
a little beedee-beedee.
Is she funny, though?

11:13.974 --> 11:18.343
I mean, how are you gonna make
her funny?
So...You know, she cracked,

11:18.345 --> 11:23.281
like, a few jokes here and
there.
But also, you know, referring to

11:23.283 --> 11:29.387
other things.
I just, you know, I'm very
flappy at the jaw.

11:29.389 --> 11:33.692
I'm very used to, like, you
know, coming back with reads
and--

11:33.694 --> 11:37.495
I'm not buying this, Gia.
[Laughs] I'm not buying it.
Give me a little Selena.

11:37.497 --> 11:43.768
Can you give me a little Selena?
Uh-huh.
<i>"Hola. Tienen preguntas?"</i>

11:43.770 --> 11:47.839
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i> Girl, Selena?</i>

11:47.841 --> 11:50.875
<i>What are you gonna do with that?</i>
<i>"I love pizza.</i>
<i>I got shot by yolanda."</i>

11:50.877 --> 11:57.148
<i>Like, what I--what's funny?</i>
<i>Like--it's the truth, gurr.</i>
<i> All right, ladies, gather</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:23.475
<i> Are you still doing Selena?</i>

12:23.477 --> 12:25.844
<i> I'm not sure.</i>

12:25.846 --> 12:31.883
<i>I have the Selena costume ready</i>
<i>on my mannequin, but I'm now</i>
<i>processing Ru's comments and</i>

12:31.885 --> 12:35.353
<i>kind of now thinking maybe</i>
<i>this isn't the best choice.</i>

12:35.355 --> 12:36.387
<i> Who else are you thinking</i>

12:36.389 --> 12:39.457
<i>about?</i>

12:39.459 --> 12:43.895
<i> You're planning on changing</i>
<i>it?</i>
<i> I mean, I'm thinking</i>

12:43.897 --> 12:47.465
<i>about it.</i>
<i> Can you change it?</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

12:47.467 --> 12:51.703
<i> So Gia's putting on makeup</i>
<i>and doesn't know who the [Fuck</i>
<i>she's gonna be.</i>

<i>Hey, girl.</i>

15:24.391 --> 15:26.758
<i> Do you know how to pronounce</i>
<i>my last name?</i>
<i> I don't.</i>

15:26.760 --> 15:31.496
<i>I had a hard time with it.</i>
<i> Well, it was "joo-dice."</i>
<i> Uh-huh.</i>

15:31.498 --> 15:34.832
<i> And then I realized it was</i>
<i>"joo-Dee-chay."</i>
<i> Uh-huh.</i>

15:34.834 --> 15:40.238
<i> But we went all the way back</i>
<i>to the old country, and it's</i>
<i>actually pronounced--</i>

15:40.240 --> 15:44.809
<i>let me see if I can get it--</i>
<i>"John-son."</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

15:44.811 --> 15:51.916

16:02.729 --> 16:07.632
<i> [Laughing] Yes.</i>
<i>Yes, Maggie Smith.</i>
<i> For now, let's just keep it</i>

<i> Coming up...</i>

16:35.128 --> 16:36.094

16:36.096 --> 16:37.195
<i>humpin' in a wool sock right</i>

<i>now.</i>

16:37.931 --> 16:38.663
<i>[Laughter]</i>

16:38.665 --> 16:40.131
<i> Not a match, your honor.</i>

16:40.133 --> 16:41.366
<i> Baloney!</i>

16:41.368 --> 16:42.333
<i> That's really rude.</i>

16:42.335 --> 16:45.336
<i> I'm talking!</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:46.004
<i>[Engine revs]</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.271
<i> [Laughing]</i>

<i> [Laughing]</i>

16:51.544 --> 16:55.747
<i>[Jazzy music]</i>
<i>Welcome back to Snatch Game!</i>
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>

16:55.749 --> 16:58.416
<i>Now, here's how the game works,</i>
<i>ladies.</i>
<i>I ask a question.</i>

16:58.418 --> 17:03.554
<i>Our celebrity contestants fill</i>
<i>in the blanks, and you give an</i>
<i>answer that you think will</i>

17:03.556 --> 17:08.960
<i>match.</i>
<i>First up, Heather McDonald.</i>
<i>"Cher is completely addicted</i>

17:08.962 --> 17:13.398
<i>to social media.</i>
<i>Even her 'blank' has a Twitter</i>
<i>account."</i>

17:13.400 --> 17:18.069
<i> I said even her wig has</i>
<i>a Twitter account.</i>
<i> Let's go to the stars and</i>

17:18.071 --> 17:21.873
<i>find out what they wrote down.</i>
<i>Judge Judy?</i>
<i> Her old nose.</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:25.643
<i> Not a match, unfortunately,</i>
<i>but--</i>
<i> she--it has been, like,</i>

17:25.645 --> 17:28.179
<i>three or four.</i>
<i> Yeah, she's been touched</i>
<i>by an angel.</i>

17:28.181 --> 17:30.982
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> And she looks great.</i>
<i> I agree, and you know, I</i>

17:30.984 --> 17:35.319
<i>agree, and so does officer byrd.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>[Imitating byrd] "of course,</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:39.357
<i>judge Judy."</i>
<i> Not a match, your honor.</i>
<i> Baloney!</i>

17:39.359 --> 17:42.927
<i>Baloney, sir!</i>
<i> I'm ready for a fried baloney</i>
<i>sandwich myself.</i>

17:42.929 --> 17:46.664
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>
<i> Let's move on down to Anna</i>
<i>Nicole Smith.</i>

17:46.666 --> 17:51.135
<i> I see that her hair changes</i>
<i>all the time.</i>
<i> Yes, it does.</i>

17:51.137 --> 17:54.872
<i> And it has, like, a mind of</i>
<i>it's own.</i>
<i> Yes, it does.</i>

17:54.874 --> 18:00.711
<i> So I put "hair," and I think</i>
<i>i won something.</i>
<i> [Laughing] Yes, you did.</i>

18:00.713 --> 18:04.682
<i>That's a match.</i>
<i> Yes, yes.</i>
<i> What do I win?</i>

18:04.684 --> 18:07.685
<i> Well, we'll tell you in a</i>
<i>minute, Anna Nicole.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

18:07.687 --> 18:12.290
<i> Let's move on down to Rachel</i>
<i>Zoe.</i>
<i> I wrote "shoes" because shoes</i>

18:12.292 --> 18:17.295
<i>are the most important</i>
<i>accessory to a women's outfit.</i>
<i>And you can actually see me,</i>

18:17.297 --> 18:20.231
<i>Rachel Zoe, to get your shoes</i>
<i>styled.</i>
<i> Uh, Ru...</i>

18:20.233 --> 18:22.433
<i> Yes?</i>
<i> Is this girl over there a</i>
<i>robot?</i>

18:22.435 --> 18:26.037
<i>Why does she sound like that?</i>
<i>Is somebody pushing a button?</i>
<i> I'm actually overworked--</i>

18:26.039 --> 18:29.307
<i> I'm talking! I'm talking!</i>
<i> And I think that's really</i>
<i>rude.</i>

18:29.309 --> 18:32.543
<i> Is that really how Rachel</i>
<i>Zoe talks?</i>
<i>No?</i>

18:32.545 --> 18:37.815
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>That's unfortunate.</i>
<i> All right, dame Maggie Smith.</i>

18:37.817 --> 18:42.086
<i>Cher, completely addicted to</i>
<i>social media.</i>
<i>Even her "blank" has a Twitter</i>

18:42.088 --> 18:44.755
<i>account.</i>
<i> Well, "ruple"--</i>
<i>"ruple," is it?</i>

18:44.757 --> 18:49.894
<i> Yes, absolutely.</i>
<i> Ruple, I understood virtually</i>
<i>none of the words that left your</i>

18:49.896 --> 18:54.232
<i>lips moments ago.</i>
<i>But I did hear the term</i>
<i>"Twitter," and I assumed that</i>

18:54.234 --> 18:58.369
<i>it's some sort of a songbird.</i>
<i> Very close.</i>
<i>Not a match.</i>

18:58.371 --> 19:02.106
<i> Am I to understand that</i>
<i>one yanks one's telephone right</i>
<i>out of the wall and carries it</i>

19:02.108 --> 19:05.510
<i>with them?</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> Ru, can you get people that</i>

19:05.512 --> 19:09.447
<i>speak normal English next time</i>
<i>for the show?</i>
<i> Excuse me, we originated</i>

19:09.449 --> 19:13.851
<i>the language.</i>
<i> Oh, okay.</i>
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>

19:13.853 --> 19:17.855
<i> All right, up next, Gillian</i>
<i>Jacobs.</i>
<i>"The city of San Francisco</i>

19:17.857 --> 19:24.595
<i>is so gay, instead of horses,</i>
<i>their mounted police ride</i>
<i>'blank.'"</i>

19:24.597 --> 19:28.499
<i> I said "bears."</i>
<i> Why not ride a bear?</i>
<i> I know you like a bear.</i>

19:28.501 --> 19:31.235
<i> I love a bear!</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I'm sweating like two rats</i>

19:31.237 --> 19:33.938
<i>humpin' in a wool sock right</i>
<i>now.</i>
<i> Oh, dear.</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:36.807
<i> Oh, my.</i>
<i> Let's see if you got any</i>
<i>matches with our stars.</i>

19:36.809 --> 19:41.846
<i>Julia child.</i>
<i> I had always heard that</i>
<i>San Francisco was--there was</i>

19:41.848 --> 19:46.150
<i>a sausage fest all year round.</i>
<i> Year-round.</i>
<i> And so they must have all</i>

19:46.152 --> 19:49.320
<i>these trucks to deliver these</i>
<i>sausages.</i>
<i> Sure, they must, yes.</i>

19:49.322 --> 19:59.063
<i> So I'd say sausage trucks.</i>
<i>[Audience ohhs]</i>
<i> Milk ain't no meryl streep.</i>

19:59.065 --> 20:03.100
<i> All right, Kim Kardashian.</i>
<i>"San Francisco is so gay,</i>
<i>instead of horses, the mounted</i>

20:03.102 --> 20:07.171
<i>police ride--"</i>
<i> well, like I always say, you</i>
<i>never put a tattoo on a Bentley.</i>

20:07.173 --> 20:09.540
<i>And I hope that I...</i>
<i> A Bentley.</i>
<i> Spelled it right.</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:14.078
<i> You probably didn't.</i>
<i> Beauty fades.</i>
<i>Dumb is forever!</i>

20:14.080 --> 20:17.381
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Up next, we've got Teresa</i>
<i>from</i> <i>the real housewives of</i>

20:17.383 --> 20:21.252
<i>New Jersey.</i>
<i>What do they ride?</i>
<i> Prostitution whoreses.</i>

20:21.254 --> 20:27.124
<i> Prostitution whoreses.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, not a match.</i>
<i> Can I have a Pinot grigio?</i>

20:27.126 --> 20:31.229
<i> Pinot grigio coming right up.</i>
<i>All right, Nicki minaj, oh, my</i>
<i>goodness.</i>

20:31.231 --> 20:33.931
<i>You've got a hairstyle change.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> Love it. That's gorgeous.</i>

20:33.933 --> 20:36.968
<i> Oh, my God, I didn't get a</i>
<i>chance to write anything down</i>
<i>'cause I was trying to change</i>

20:36.970 --> 20:39.604
<i>my wig.</i>
<i>[Audience ohhs]</i>
<i> oh, okay.</i>

20:39.606 --> 20:42.773
<i> Wig changes.</i>
<i>How original.</i>
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>

20:42.775 --> 20:45.243
<i>How many years ago?</i>
<i> You didn't write down</i>
<i>anything.</i>

20:45.245 --> 20:47.979
<i> No.</i>
<i> Perhaps she needs another</i>
<i>pot of ink to replenish her</i>

20:47.981 --> 20:51.349
<i>quill.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

20:51.351 --> 20:55.853
<i> All right, Heather.</i>
<i>"That Chelsea handler is so</i>
<i>wrong.</i>

20:55.855 --> 21:01.359
<i>She's launching a new vodka.</i>
<i>It's flavored with 'blank.'"</i>
<i> Xanax.</i>

21:01.361 --> 21:05.730
<i> Xanax!</i>
<i>What a great idea!</i>
<i>Okay, let's go on over to</i>

21:05.732 --> 21:09.867
<i>Anna Nicole Smith to see if she</i>
<i>matched you.</i>
<i> Well, I'm not really a</i>

21:09.869 --> 21:14.405
<i>drinker.</i>
<i> Right.</i>
<i> But I've tasted vodka a</i>

21:14.407 --> 21:19.977
<i>couple of times in my life,</i>
<i>and I like it by itself.</i>
<i> [Laughing] Uh-huh.</i>

21:19.979 --> 21:25.549
<i> So I just put "vodcah."</i>
<i> Unfortunately, it's not a</i>
<i>match, but it's a good answer,</i>

21:25.551 --> 21:29.920
<i>Anna Nicole.</i>
<i> Kimmie!</i>
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>

21:29.922 --> 21:34.759
<i> Fran drescher.</i>
<i>Chelsea handler's launching a</i>
<i>new vodka flavored with--</i>

21:34.761 --> 21:38.896
<i> I said "alcohol."</i>
<i>[Laughs nasally]</i>
<i> I know I can do a better</i>

21:38.898 --> 21:42.466
<i>Fran drescher than Courtney.</i>
<i>[Imitating drescher] "oh,</i>
<i>Mr. sheffield."</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:48.072
<i>[Laughs nasally]</i>
<i> Let's move on to Kim</i>
<i>Kardashian.</i>

21:48.074 --> 21:52.076
<i>New vodka.</i>
<i>Favored with "blank."</i>
<i> I'm gonna have to go with</i>

21:52.078 --> 21:56.113
<i>"big black dick."</i>
<i>[Dramatic drumbeat]</i>
<i>[Audience oohs]</i>

21:56.115 --> 21:58.716
<i> Kardashian, you want to date</i>
<i>him?</i>
<i> Yes, dear--</i>

21:58.718 --> 22:02.887
<i>oh!</i>
<i> She's a real keeper.</i>
<i>As in "keep 'er in a cage."</i>

22:02.889 --> 22:06.424
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> All right, Teresa.</i>
<i>It's flavored with "blank."</i>

22:06.426 --> 22:10.361
<i> "Cumm-in."</i>
<i> Oh, oh, you mean "cue-min."</i>
<i> "Cumm-in."</i>

22:10.363 --> 22:14.398
<i> Y-yeah, it's pronounced</i>
<i>"cue-min."</i>
<i> "Cumm-in."</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:17.868
<i> Okay, all right.</i>
<i>Let's move on down to dame</i>
<i>Maggie Smith.</i>

22:17.870 --> 22:23.307
<i> Well, I'm unfamiliar with the</i>
<i>work of lady handler.</i>
<i>However, I did think that it</i>

22:23.309 --> 22:27.678
<i>would be rather amusing if there</i>

<i>[Chortles]</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>can you imagine such a thing?</i>

22:32.051 --> 22:37.922
<i>[Giggles]</i>
<i> That is really new-fangled.</i>
<i>I can't imagine such a thing.</i>

22:37.924 --> 22:41.592
<i> Yes.</i>
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>
<i> oh, I'm sorry.</i>

22:41.594 --> 22:46.430
<i>Time is up, which means</i>
<i>our winner is...</i>
<i>[Drumroll]</i>

22:46.432 --> 22:50.768
<i>Who cares?</i>
<i>[Laughter, applause]</i>
<i>this is RuPaul, reminding you</i>

22:50.770 --> 22:54.905
<i>to spay and neuter your friends</i>
<i>and neighbors.</i>
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

22:54.907 --> 22:58.042
<i>Say good-bye, stars.</i>
<i> All: Bye!</i>
<i> Y'all come back now,</i>

22:58.044 --> 23:01.345
<i> coming up...</i>

23:01.347 --> 23:03.047
<i>She was really channeling her.</i>

23:03.049 --> 23:03.748
<i> Yes.</i>

23:03.750 --> 23:04.982
<i> It was a perfect choice for</i>

23:04.984 --> 23:05.750
<i>her.</i>

23:05.752 --> 23:07.151
<i> It's the tightest snatch</i>

23:07.153 --> 23:08.486
<i>game in history.</i>

23:08.488 --> 23:11.255
<i>[Laughter]</i>

23:11.257 --> 23:15.493
<i> [Laughing]</i>

23:15.495 --> 23:16.727
<i>[Dramatic dance music]</i>

23:16.729 --> 23:18.162
<i> Meow.</i>

23:18.164 --> 23:19.630
<i> Tonight's runway theme is</i>

23:19.632 --> 23:21.665
<i>"night of a thousand rus."</i>

23:21.667 --> 23:25.636
<i>We have to dress up as RuPaul,</i>
<i>which is exciting.</i>
<i>But RuPaul's gonna be in the</i>

23:25.638 --> 23:30.941
<i>room, so--</i>
<i> am I the only one that's,</i>
<i>like, having a problem with,</i>

23:30.943 --> 23:34.779
<i>like, my body?</i>
<i>My friends and I kid around</i>
<i>about--like, we call it "hog</i>

23:34.781 --> 23:37.314
<i>body."</i>
<i>Just, like, we're really thick</i>
<i>in the midsection.</i>

23:37.316 --> 23:40.451
<i> Do you feel overweight?</i>
<i> I just feel like I have a</i>
<i>weird-proportioned body.</i>

23:40.453 --> 23:44.121
<i> Well, maybe you do.</i>
<i>And so what?</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

23:44.123 --> 23:49.693
<i> I have lots to say about</i>
<i>weight.</i>
<i>I was very heavy all through</i>

23:49.695 --> 23:57.635
<i>middle school, and I was teased</i>
<i>mercilessly about it,</i>
<i>for being gay and being fat.</i>

23:57.637 --> 24:03.040
<i>It affected my self-confidence</i>
<i>so profoundly.</i>
<i>I just felt completely unlovable</i>

24:03.042 --> 24:06.310
<i>for so many years because of</i>
<i>that.</i>
<i>[Tender music]</i>

24:06.312 --> 24:07.878
<i>My mom, she'd been sort of</i>

24:07.880 --> 24:09.547
<i>the big proponent of me being</i>

24:09.549 --> 24:12.316
<i>myself and that I was beautiful.</i>

24:12.318 --> 24:16.921
<i>And then, when I was 13, my</i>
<i>mom died.</i>
<i>I just...</i>

24:16.923 --> 24:25.529
<i> </i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>that really threw me into a</i>

24:25.531 --> 24:30.201
<i>tailspin.</i>
<i>I didn't have that voice saying</i>
<i>that who I was was okay anymore.</i>

24:30.203 --> 24:34.371
<i>I just had a lot of voices at</i>
<i>school saying that everything</i>
<i>about me was wrong.</i>

24:34.373 --> 24:41.312
<i>Too fat, too gay, too weird.</i>
<i>Something I never expected to</i>
<i>happen was that I learned a lot</i>

24:41.314 --> 24:45.616
<i>from my drag character that I</i>
<i>could bring to my boy self.</i>
<i> Right.</i>

24:45.618 --> 24:51.222
<i> I haven't forgotten anything</i>
<i>that's happened to me in those</i>
<i>years, but I have learned to</i>

24:51.224 --> 24:56.961
<i>use the hardship to get</i>
<i>stronger.</i>
<i> Adore.</i>

24:56.963 --> 25:00.130
<i> Yes, baby?</i>
<i> If you don't want to get</i>
<i>yelled at by Michelle--'cause</i>

25:00.132 --> 25:02.833
<i>didn't she tell you last time</i>
<i>that you needed to be cinched?</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

25:02.835 --> 25:06.971
<i> I--and don't tell anybody</i>
<i>that I'm being kind--but I have</i>
<i>another cincher, if you want me</i>

25:06.973 --> 25:09.673
<i>to lace you in it.</i>
<i> I'm down.</i>
<i> Okay, we'll do it.</i>

25:09.675 --> 25:10.541
<i> I'm really grateful for</i>

25:10.543 --> 25:11.842
<i>Bianca's motherly kind of</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:12.877
<i>instinct.</i>

25:12.879 --> 25:18.415
<i>She's kinda my step-mom right</i>
<i>now.</i>
<i>I'm a foster child.</i>

<i>[Applause]</i>

25:45.845 --> 25:48.846
<i>Welcome to the main stage</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:51.015
<i>Michelle Visage, you've never</i>

25:51.017 --> 25:51.849
<i>looked so beautiful.</i>

25:51.851 --> 25:53.817
<i>[Laughter]</i>

25:53.819 --> 25:56.554
<i>Santino Rice, if you looked any</i>

25:56.556 --> 26:00.624
<i>better, I'd have to blank you.</i>

26:00.626 --> 26:02.726
<i>Funny lady Heather McDonald,</i>

26:02.728 --> 26:04.061
<i>did my queens snatch your</i>

<i>attention?</i>

26:04.931 --> 26:06.797
<i> Yes, and you look stunning.</i>

26:06.799 --> 26:07.665
<i> Thank you.</i>

26:07.667 --> 26:10.935
<i>And super fan Gillian Jacobs.</i>

<i>This week, my queens were</i>

<i>the category is...</i>
<i>Me.</i>

26:25.217 --> 26:31.255
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>
<i>And may the best woman win.</i>
<i>  now, sissy that walk </i>

26:31.257 --> 26:32.022
<i>[RuPaul's</i> <i>sissy that walk]</i>

26:32.024 --> 26:33.958
<i> First up, Joslyn Fox.</i>

26:33.960 --> 26:35.926
<i>Yes, mama.</i>

26:35.928 --> 26:37.127
<i> Serving slit.</i>

26:37.129 --> 26:41.765
<i> Girl, why it gotta be black?</i>
<i> I am serving evening glam</i>
<i>RuPaul.</i>

26:41.767 --> 26:46.437
<i>I'm feeling fabulous, fishy,</i>
<i>and fierce.</i>
<i> I like the little swivel she</i>

26:46.439 --> 26:49.506
<i>does with her arms.</i>
<i> I think, Heather, she just</i>
<i>passed gas.</i>

26:49.508 --> 26:51.709
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> [Snorts]</i>

26:51.711 --> 26:54.178
<i> Next up, Gia Gunn.</i>

26:54.180 --> 26:55.446
<i> Bitch stole your look.</i>

26:55.448 --> 27:00.651
<i> That's my dress.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I'm serving my RuPaul gown</i>

27:00.653 --> 27:05.022
<i>that is very iconic, and I'm</i>
<i>eating it up.</i>
<i> And this is the back.</i>

27:05.024 --> 27:07.257
<i> Mm.</i>
<i> I love a nude illusion.</i>

27:07.259 --> 27:09.293
<i> Dip into the waters</i>

<i> Oh.</i>

27:12.298 --> 27:16.734
<i> Rowr.</i>
<i> The masquerade ball.</i>
<i> Yes, all-star.</i>

27:16.736 --> 27:21.972
<i> I'm giving RuPaul my version</i>

<i>[Purrs]</i>
<i></i> <i>Eyes wide shut.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

27:34.520 --> 27:40.090
<i> Fembots have feelings too.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> I am serving season four</i>

27:40.092 --> 27:44.595
<i>"start your engines" mama Ru.</i>
<i>And I'm feelin' it, girl.</i>
<i>I'm plummeting the runway and</i>

27:44.597 --> 27:49.500
<i>dropping it like it's hot.</i>
<i> Such a good body.</i>
<i>I wish her hair was Fuller.</i>

27:49.502 --> 27:52.903
<i>That's the only thing.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

27:52.905 --> 27:55.172
<i> Bianca Del Rio.</i>

27:55.174 --> 27:56.674
<i>Cover girl.</i>

<i>I'm giving Ru realness now,</i>

<i> She sparkles just like</i>

<i>I look fucking cool.</i>

28:26.405 --> 28:30.274
<i> She's cinched for the gods.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> Work that body.</i>

28:30.276 --> 28:33.143
<i>Work that body.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

28:33.145 --> 28:35.979
<i>Trinity K. Bonet.</i>

28:35.981 --> 28:38.549
<i>Foxy lady,</i> out of sight.

28:38.551 --> 28:44.855
Get your rebel on, gurrl.
I am serving up illusion of
RuPaul, and I look absolutely

28:44.857 --> 28:48.358
amazing.
Birds of a feather.
Didn't know that birds came

28:48.360 --> 28:51.562
in that color.
[Laughs]
Work it, mama.

28:51.564 --> 28:55.766
Up next, Ben de LA creme.

28:55.768 --> 28:56.934
Wait a minute.

28:56.936 --> 29:00.871
That is my dress!
[Laughter]
I'm giving some contemporary

29:00.873 --> 29:06.043
RuPaul.
I'm working that runway, and
I feel great in my dress.

29:06.045 --> 29:09.847
This is like identity theft.
First she steals Michelle's
identity.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.783
Now she steals mine.
You'll be hearing from my
lawyers.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.652
Thunder from down under.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.054
Courtney Act.

29:17.056 --> 29:17.821
Ohh.

29:17.823 --> 29:18.622
Oh, my goodness.

29:18.624 --> 29:22.326
I mean, the legs are the best
legs I've ever seen in my life.
Oh, wait, hold up, now.

29:22.328 --> 29:27.197
Wait a minute.
Besides you, besides you.
I am possessed by the spirit

29:27.199 --> 29:33.704
of RuPaul, and I can hear Ru's
voice in my head saying,
<i>"supermodel of the world!"</i>

29:33.706 --> 29:37.841
<i> I wore this outfit to the</i>
<i>vh1 fashion awards.</i>
<i> Yes, you did.</i>

29:37.843 --> 29:42.346
<i>Milk.</i>

29:42.348 --> 29:45.415
<i> Oh!</i>

29:45.417 --> 29:51.889
<i> Hello, hello, hello!</i>
<i>It's workroom Ru.</i>
<i>No one has ever seen this on</i>

29:51.891 --> 29:56.760
<i>the runway.</i>
<i>I am working my ascot off.</i>
<i> Is that a klein Epstein</i>

29:56.762 --> 30:02.633
<i>Parker suit?</i>
<i>Lady looks like a dude.</i>
<i>  now, sissy that walk </i>

30:02.635 --> 30:03.767
<i> coming up...</i>

30:03.769 --> 30:05.369
<i>A lot could be forgiven if you</i>

30:05.371 --> 30:06.503
<i>were funny, but you were not</i>

30:06.505 --> 30:07.871
<i>funny.</i>

30:07.873 --> 30:09.406
<i> I'm extremely offended that</i>

30:09.408 --> 30:11.008
<i>you would come out on the runway</i>

30:11.010 --> 30:14.011
<i>in pants.</i>

30:14.013 --> 30:15.512
<i> [Laughing]</i>

30:15.514 --> 30:19.750
<i> [Laughing]</i>

30:19.752 --> 30:25.589
<i> Welcome, ladies.</i>
<i>I've made some decisions.</i>
<i>Courtney Act,</i>

30:25.591 --> 30:32.563
<i>Darienne Lake,</i>
<i>Joslyn Fox,</i>
<i>Trinity K. Bonet,</i>

30:32.565 --> 30:38.402
<i>you're safe.</i>
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>

30:38.404 --> 30:46.009
<i>Ladies, it's time for the</i>
<i>judges' critiques.</i>
<i>Let's start with Gia Gunn.</i>

30:46.011 --> 30:48.512
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> Let's talk about the snatch</i>
<i>game.</i>

30:48.514 --> 30:54.117
<i>This is season six.</i>
<i>You don't pick a celebrity with</i>
<i>not a big personality.</i>

30:54.119 --> 30:58.121
<i>It was flat.</i>
<i> When I spoke with you in the</i>
<i>workroom, you were gonna do</i>

30:58.123 --> 31:02.726
<i>Selena.</i>
<i>Why'd you change your mind?</i>
<i> Because she is not a comedy</i>

31:02.728 --> 31:06.997
<i>character.</i>
<i> But that just dawned on you</i>
<i>in the workroom?</i>

31:06.999 --> 31:11.435
<i>Listen, a lot could be forgiven</i>
<i>if you were funny, but you were</i>
<i>not funny.</i>

31:11.437 --> 31:16.473
<i>Next up, Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i> Hi, mama Ru.</i>
<i> Rachel Zoe.</i>

31:16.475 --> 31:18.942
<i>You were playing, like, the</i>
<i>chicken lady from</i> <i>kids in the</i>
<i>hall.</i>

31:18.944 --> 31:21.078
<i>There was a lot--of this--</i>
<i>kind of--</i>
<i> I agree.</i>

31:21.080 --> 31:25.315
<i> It didn't work.</i>
<i> Rachel Zoe is known for so</i>
<i>many catchphrases that I might</i>

31:25.317 --> 31:28.318
<i>write a cheat sheet.</i>
<i> I did.</i>
<i> You did?</i>

31:28.320 --> 31:31.221
<i> I definitely got in my head</i>
<i>in this one.</i>
<i>I saw my sisters really</i>

31:31.223 --> 31:34.558
<i>succeeding, and instead of</i>
<i>pushing more forward, I sunk</i>
<i>back.</i>

31:34.560 --> 31:39.029
<i> You're talented, so it hurts</i>
<i>to see it.</i>
<i> It hurts me too.</i>

31:39.031 --> 31:43.767
<i> Up next, Bianca Del Rio.</i>
<i>Love that dress.</i>
<i> You can borrow it.</i>

31:43.769 --> 31:47.871
<i> I have been waiting for a</i>
<i>queen to do judge Judy!</i>
<i>It was brilliant.</i>

31:47.873 --> 31:50.240
<i> Well, it does help that I'm</i>
<i>a judgmental bitch too.</i>
<i>That does kind of help.</i>

31:50.242 --> 31:53.710
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> You were able to interact</i>
<i>with the other queens.</i>

31:53.712 --> 31:57.915
<i>It was fabulous.</i>
<i> Next up, Adore Delano.</i>
<i> There is nothing RuPaul</i>

31:57.917 --> 32:02.719
<i>about that wig.</i>
<i>Nor the look, quite honestly.</i>
<i> I was doing Adore inspired</i>

32:02.721 --> 32:06.390
<i>by RuPaul.</i>
<i> Yeah, you were doing Adore.</i>
<i>And I think this length is gonna</i>

32:06.392 --> 32:11.328
<i>be a running theme for you.</i>
<i>But I can't thank you enough for</i>
<i>cinching your waist.</i>

32:11.330 --> 32:15.699
<i>It changes your body completely.</i>
<i>You need to start doing this</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

32:15.701 --> 32:19.503
<i> I can feel my heart in my</i>
<i>throat, and it tastes amazing.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

32:19.505 --> 32:24.675
<i> Your Anna Nicole Smith,</i>
<i>guess ad '94 realness was</i>
<i>performance art.</i>

32:24.677 --> 32:29.780
<i> Up next, de LA.</i>
<i> I love this yellow look.</i>
<i>It's really well done.</i>

32:29.782 --> 32:33.350
<i> I don't even watch</i> <i>downton</i>
<i>abbey,</i> and I was dying over
Maggie Smith.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.053
Yeah, like when you said...
[British accent] "Originated
the language,"

32:36.055 --> 32:39.423
that was, like, one of the
funniest things I heard all day
yesterday.

32:39.425 --> 32:43.260
[Laughs]
And I think I said it about
six times after I left.

32:43.262 --> 32:48.532
Last, but not least, Milk.
Hello, hello, hello!
Part of me, Milk, is

32:48.534 --> 32:53.136
extremely offended that you
would come out on the runway
in pants.

32:53.138 --> 32:57.941
Part of me thinks it's genius
because it is RuPaul.
Well, that's sort of what I

32:57.943 --> 33:02.079
love.
I love going for the unexpected.
But this doesn't shock me,

33:02.081 --> 33:05.716
really.
What would shock me is if you
had come out here and done

33:05.718 --> 33:09.753
something so amazingly glam,
'cause we really haven't seen
you like that.

33:09.755 --> 33:14.691
I could go more glam, but
it wouldn't be staying true
to my aesthetic.

33:14.693 --> 33:19.696
But I would love to see you
as <i>glamazon.</i>
<i> Honestly, sometimes I do feel</i>

33:19.698 --> 33:24.534
<i>that if I were to put on a</i>
<i>beautiful dress like these girls</i>
<i>and beautiful hair like them,</i>

33:24.536 --> 33:30.007
<i>i would stand out for the wrong</i>
<i>reasons, and people would just</i>
<i>laugh at me, and I wouldn't be</i>

33:30.009 --> 33:34.311
<i>able to laugh at myself.</i>
<i> But it's hard to fall in</i>
<i>love with someone who doesn't</i>

33:34.313 --> 33:38.915
<i>show that vulnerability that</i>
<i>you're afraid of.</i>
<i>Ladies, thank you.</i>

33:38.917 --> 33:42.853
<i>While you unwind in</i>
<i>the untucked lounge,</i>
<i>the judges and I will</i>

33:42.855 --> 33:46.423
<i>deliberate.</i>
<i>[Engine revs]</i>
<i>all right, just between us</i>

33:46.425 --> 33:51.294
<i>RuPaul impersonators, what do</i>
<i>you think?</i>
<i>It's the tightest snatch</i>

33:51.296 --> 33:54.765
<i>game in history.</i>
<i> I agree, and I should know</i>
<i>about tight snatch games.</i>

33:54.767 --> 34:00.804
<i> I don't think so, Michelle.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>let's start with Bianca Del Rio.</i>

34:00.806 --> 34:04.908
<i> Her judge Judy was well</i>
<i>researched.</i>
<i>She stayed in character.</i>

34:04.910 --> 34:09.780
<i>It was a perfect choice for her.</i>
<i> But I didn't think that she</i>
<i>was the best Ru look.</i>

34:09.782 --> 34:12.983
<i>You didn't look at it and go,</i>
<i>oh, my God, that just reminds me</i>
<i>so much of RuPaul.</i>

34:12.985 --> 34:18.522
<i> All right, let's move on to</i>
<i>Laganja Estranja.</i>
<i> What she was giving is your</i>

34:18.524 --> 34:22.225
<i>fembot, you know, intergalactic</i>
<i>look.</i>
<i>Yeah, it wasn't all gold.</i>

34:22.227 --> 34:26.296
<i>It was purple and black.</i>
<i>But I didn't mind her look</i>
<i>tonight on the runway.</i>

34:26.298 --> 34:30.200
<i> For me, her Rachel Zoe was</i>
<i>more William shatner than</i>
<i>Rachel Zoe.</i>

34:30.202 --> 34:33.103
<i> Ooh, that's hot.</i>
<i> Right?</i>
<i> I really think the nerves</i>

34:33.105 --> 34:37.140
<i>got the best of her.</i>
<i> All right, let's move on</i>
<i>down to Adore Delano.</i>

34:37.142 --> 34:41.878
<i>That Anna Nicole Smith--I was</i>
<i>hypnotized.</i>
<i>I knew Anna Nicole Smith,</i>

34:41.880 --> 34:45.949
<i>and she was really channeling</i>
<i>her.</i>
<i> But when she came out</i>

34:45.951 --> 34:50.387
<i>supposedly being you, I thought</i>
<i>she was kind of still doing</i>
<i>a little bit of Anna Nicole.</i>

34:50.389 --> 34:52.989
<i>Like--</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I think she really has been</i>

34:52.991 --> 34:56.860
<i>acting like Anna Nicole her</i>
<i>whole life, and then I didn't</i>
<i>think the impression was as</i>

34:56.862 --> 35:00.063
<i>amazing as I thought it was</i>
<i>the other day.</i>
<i> All right, let's move on to</i>

35:00.065 --> 35:05.102
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> I think she was superior</i>
<i>in the look of Ru and also in</i>

35:05.104 --> 35:09.406
<i>the character of Maggie Smith.</i>
<i> I would agree.</i>
<i>Her comebacks were so funny.</i>

35:09.408 --> 35:12.776
<i> But the con for me was it</i>
<i>was another old lady.</i>
<i> Ah, that's right.</i>

35:12.778 --> 35:15.245
<i>That's her forte.</i>
<i> Not that it wasn't brilliant,</i>
<i>but I felt like we saw it</i>

35:15.247 --> 35:18.582
<i>already.</i>
<i> All right, let's move on down</i>
<i>to Gia Gunn.</i>

35:18.584 --> 35:23.453
<i> You wanna talk about a</i>
<i>Halloween costume in a bag--</i>
<i>that wig and the wonky eye with</i>

35:23.455 --> 35:25.722
<i>the eyelash?</i>
<i> Crack ho.</i>
<i> [Snickers]</i>

35:25.724 --> 35:29.426
<i> And couldn't have picked</i>
<i>a worse character to do</i>
<i>on Snatch Game.</i>

35:29.428 --> 35:32.762
<i> You could do Kim Kardashian.</i>
<i> If you played it up.</i>
<i> If you played it up.</i>

35:32.764 --> 35:35.999
<i> I concur.</i>
<i>Where were the boobies?</i>
<i>Where was the ass?</i>

35:36.001 --> 35:39.369
<i>She could've started every</i>
<i>sentence with a "k".</i>
<i> That is a brilliant idea.</i>

35:39.371 --> 35:42.639
<i>That would've been funny.</i>
<i> She just didn't really go</i>
<i>for it.</i>

35:42.641 --> 35:48.245
<i> All right, next up, Milk.</i>
<i> Well, I could see the wheels</i>
<i>turning every moment of the</i>

35:48.247 --> 35:53.116
<i>Julia child.</i>
<i> I think she made a really</i>
<i>poor choice being boy Ru</i>

35:53.118 --> 35:58.622
<i>because we're here to see</i>
<i>all different sides of a queen.</i>
<i> But I see this conflict in</i>

35:58.624 --> 36:03.827
<i>Milk between wanting to stay</i>
<i>true to this gender-bending,</i>
<i>which I respect.</i>

36:03.829 --> 36:07.998
<i>But I feel like every time I've</i>
<i>heard a drag queen on this show</i>
<i>say, "I need to stay true to my</i>

36:08.000 --> 36:13.603
<i>drag," they go home very</i>
<i>shortly thereafter.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

36:13.605 --> 36:17.541
<i> Silence.</i>
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
<i>[British accent] bring back</i>

36:17.543 --> 36:20.710
<i>[engine revs]</i>

36:20.712 --> 36:22.179
<i>[Laughing]</i>

36:22.181 --> 36:26.750
<i> [Laughing]</i>

36:26.752 --> 36:31.588
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>I've made some decisions.</i>
<i>[Dramatic drumbeat]</i>

36:31.590 --> 36:37.194
<i>Tonight...</i>
<i>It's the prime of</i>
<i>miss Ben de LA creme.</i>

36:37.196 --> 36:40.230
<i>Condragulations, you are the</i>
<i>winner of this challenge.</i>
<i>[Applause]</i>

36:40.232 --> 36:47.704
<i> Thank you so, so much.</i>
<i> You've won two couture</i>
<i>outfits from syren latex,</i>

36:47.706 --> 36:52.409
<i> I'm the first one to win</i>

36:52.411 --> 36:53.543
<i>two challenges.</i>

36:53.545 --> 36:58.114
<i>And this is the challenge that</i>
<i>i was most terrified about,</i>
<i>and I won it!</i>

36:58.116 --> 37:02.586
<i> Bianca Del Rio,</i>
<i>you're safe.</i>
<i> [No audio]</i>

37:02.588 --> 37:10.560
<i> Adore, you're safe.</i>
<i> [Silently] Thank you.</i>
<i> Milk, your Julia child</i>

37:10.562 --> 37:22.038
<i>impersonation was half-baked.</i>
<i>Gia Gunn, as Kim Kardashian,</i>
<i>you fell flat on your ass.</i>

37:22.040 --> 37:29.546
<i>Laganja Estranja, your Rachel</i>
<i>Zoe was</i> <i>so...</i>
<i>Fashion-weak.</i>

37:29.548 --> 37:37.354
<i>Li-ter-a-lly.</i>
<i>Milk...</i>
<i>You are safe.</i>

37:37.356 --> 37:41.258
<i>[Tense music]</i>
<i> </i>

37:41.260 --> 37:42.592
<i> this is some bullshit.</i>

37:42.594 --> 37:49.232
<i>Milk belongs in the bottom.</i>
<i> But just by the seat of my</i>
<i>pants.</i>

37:49.234 --> 37:55.572
<i>Gia and Laganja,</i>
<i>I'm sorry, my dears, but you</i>
<i>are up for elimination.</i>

37:55.574 --> 38:05.015
<i>Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Ladies, this is your last chance</i>
<i>to impress me and save yourself</i>

38:05.017 --> 38:10.987
<i>from elimination.</i>
<i>The time has come...</i>
<i>[Thunder rumbles]</i>

38:10.989 --> 38:16.926
<i>To lip-synch...</i>
<i>For your life!</i>
<i>[Dramatic music]</i>

38:16.928 --> 38:20.063
<i> </i>
<i> I can't believe I'm in the</i>
<i>bottom two.</i>

38:20.065 --> 38:23.900
<i>And I'm up against one of my</i>
<i>best friends in this</i>
<i>competition.</i>

38:23.902 --> 38:26.236
<i>And that really sucks.</i>

38:26.238 --> 38:27.971
<i> Good luck.</i>

38:27.973 --> 38:30.173
<i>And don't fuck it up.</i>

38:30.175 --> 38:34.010
<i> </i>

38:34.012 --> 38:38.148
<i>  head to toe </i>

38:38.150 --> 38:45.422
<i> I know </i>
<i>  today started </i>
<i> with a crazy kiss </i>

38:45.424 --> 38:49.793
<i> on our way home </i>
<i> girl, I'm giving it</i>
<i>everything I've got--</i>

38:49.795 --> 38:54.331
<i>toe-touch into the splits,</i>
<i>death drops right off the bat.</i>
<i>I don't want to go home.</i>

38:54.333 --> 38:59.035
<i>  Who would have known? </i>
<i> I'm showing the judges that</i>
<i>i love to perform.</i>

38:59.037 --> 39:02.906
<i>I love to vogue.</i>
<i>I'm giving face, and that's</i>
<i>usually what counts.</i>

39:02.908 --> 39:07.944
<i>  From head to toe </i>
<i> 14 karat love </i>
<i> you are my jewel of the nile </i>

39:07.946 --> 39:13.350
<i> when we make love </i>
<i> diamonds are forever </i>
<i> top to bottom </i>

39:13.352 --> 39:20.857
<i> I love you </i>
<i> I will leave you never </i>
<i> I got to, got to tell you </i>

39:20.859 --> 39:23.793
<i> rule number one: You're gonna</i>
<i>do a reveal, get out of the</i>
<i>dress.</i>

39:23.795 --> 39:25.495
<i>We all know "reveal" in French</i>

39:25.497 --> 39:27.130
<i>means "take the shit off."</i>

39:27.132 --> 39:32.936
<i>  But my angel </i>
<i> you forget your wings </i>
<i> tonight </i>

39:32.938 --> 39:39.109
<i>  heaven up above </i>
<i>  baby, you got the love </i>
<i> I can see the difference in</i>

39:39.111 --> 39:43.380
<i>their styles.</i>
<i>Gia's a lot more controlled.</i>
<i>Laganja is giving everything.</i>

39:43.382 --> 39:47.650
<i>The jump split is pretty</i>
<i>impressive.</i>
<i>  you got to know </i>

39:47.652 --> 39:49.719
<i>[applause]</i>

39:49.721 --> 39:56.259
<i> Ladies, I've made my</i>
<i>decision.</i>
<i>[Dramatic music]</i>

39:56.261 --> 40:05.068
<i> </i>
<i>Laganja Estranja,</i>
<i>shante, you stay.</i>

40:05.070 --> 40:11.508
<i> Thank you so much.</i>
<i> You may join the other girls.</i>
<i>G-g-g-Gia.</i>

40:11.510 --> 40:20.250
<i>My pet, make no mistake.</i>
<i>I love you from head to toe.</i>
<i>Now sashay away.</i>

40:20.252 --> 40:27.390
<i> You guys are all still dudes.</i>

40:27.392 --> 40:28.224
<i>I'm upset that there's other</i>

40:28.226 --> 40:29.726
<i>cross-dressers still in there</i>

40:29.728 --> 40:30.760
<i>that fucking came to a drag</i>

40:30.762 --> 40:32.796
<i>show dressed as boys.</i>

40:32.798 --> 40:34.431
<i>I mean, if you look up "drag,"</i>

40:34.433 --> 40:36.299
<i>drag means dressing up as girls,</i>

40:36.301 --> 40:38.201
<i>not re-enhancing what you</i>

40:38.203 --> 40:39.536
<i>already are, which is a fucking</i>

40:39.538 --> 40:43.473
<i>big man.</i>

40:43.475 --> 40:46.242
<i> My nine ladies prancing,</i>

40:46.244 --> 40:47.544
<i>remember, if you can't love</i>

40:47.546 --> 40:48.912
<i>yourself, how in the hell you</i>

40:48.914 --> 40:49.979
<i>gonna love somebody else?</i>

40:49.981 --> 40:51.281
<i>Can I get an "amen" in here?</i>

40:51.283 --> 40:52.549
<i> All: Amen!</i>

40:52.551 --> 40:54.117
<i> Now let the music play.</i>
