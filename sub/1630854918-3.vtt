WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.820
HARRY: <i>I'm Harry Tasker,</i>
<i>husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

00:05.020 --> 00:07.950
<i>and for 17 years the most</i>
<i>important person in my life</i>

00:08.150 --> 00:10.040
<i>didn't know</i>
<i>I was also something else.</i>

00:11.040 --> 00:13.330
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

00:13.530 --> 00:14.960
HELEN:
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:16.730
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

00:16.930 --> 00:18.560
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:21.100
<i>where I found out</i>
<i>our whole life was a lie,</i>

00:21.300 --> 00:23.820
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

00:24.690 --> 00:26.640
HARRY:
<i>Honey, all those things</i>
<i>are true.</i>

00:26.840 --> 00:28.340
<i>They're just, you know...</i>
HELEN: <i>What?</i>

00:28.540 --> 00:31.060
HARRY:
<i>True lies.</i>

00:33.960 --> 00:36.470
* *

00:39.300 --> 00:44.320
COMPUTER:
The 2017 Zurich terrorist
attack killed 180 people,

00:44.520 --> 00:45.920
destroying several city blocks.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.190
The weapon was purchased
from an arms dealer

00:48.390 --> 00:50.160
known only as the Engineer,

00:50.360 --> 00:51.930
who disappeared without a trace.

00:52.130 --> 00:54.930
In 2019, Omega Sector
joined forces

00:55.130 --> 00:57.540
with MI6 lead operative
Ian Young,

00:57.740 --> 00:59.270
tracking the Engineer to Prague

00:59.470 --> 01:01.510
for an undercover
arms purchase called...

01:01.710 --> 01:04.180
<i>Operation: Mousetrap.</i>

01:04.380 --> 01:06.560
* *

01:08.160 --> 01:09.150
* Ooh... *

01:09.350 --> 01:10.480
Okay, Ian,

01:10.680 --> 01:12.150
we're gonna review
this one last time.

01:12.350 --> 01:13.520
You're gonna be meeting on

01:13.720 --> 01:14.820
the fifth floor of that
building down there.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.620
We'll be monitoring
via the radios.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.190
You go in, make contact
with the Engineer...

01:19.390 --> 01:21.360
And as soon as I confirm
he's got the nuke, you come in.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.000
Just remember,
be careful.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.200
The Engineer only
works alone, okay?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.530
So, if we spook him,

01:26.730 --> 01:27.970
this could be the...
I will be extra charming.

01:28.170 --> 01:29.500
You sure you don't want me
in there with you?

01:29.700 --> 01:30.940
IAN:
Appreciate it, but

01:31.140 --> 01:32.610
MI6 has been after the Engineer
for over a year.

01:32.810 --> 01:37.360
Can't let you Omegas swoop
in and steal all the glory.

01:42.130 --> 01:43.570
Okay, team,
let's get ready.

01:46.670 --> 01:48.320
HARRY:
All right, I got eyes on Ian.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.710
He's going in.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.390
GIB:
Maria? Luther? You ready?

01:53.590 --> 01:55.380
LUTHER: Ready steady.
MARIA: Best team ever.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.910
You guys know you're still
on the radios, right?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.270
IAN:
Made it to the lift.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.540
Copy that.

02:03.740 --> 02:06.510
He's almost in, guys.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.690
When we hear the word
"nuclear," we move.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.480
I repeat, "nuclear"

02:10.680 --> 02:12.550
is our go term.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.410
IAN:
Going up the hall.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.080
Approaching door.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.680
Hello? Hello, is anyone...?

02:18.880 --> 02:20.120
What the hell do you
think you're...?

02:20.320 --> 02:21.120
No, no.
Ian?

02:21.320 --> 02:22.160
No, don't!
(static)

02:22.360 --> 02:23.220
(Ian grunts)

02:23.420 --> 02:25.160
Ian, this is Gib. Report. Ian.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.330
(gunshot)

02:26.530 --> 02:27.690
Ian's down.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.530
Guys, Ian is down.
I repeat, Ian's down.

02:29.730 --> 02:30.950
Go now, go now!

02:33.080 --> 02:34.400
(grunting)

02:34.600 --> 02:35.930
HARRY:
Go, go, go.

02:36.130 --> 02:37.600
Watch the corners.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.940
MARIA:
Clear.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.490
Clear.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.180
(groans)

02:48.380 --> 02:49.820
HARRY:
Gib, we're too late.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.000
Ian's dead.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.160
(both groan)

03:04.360 --> 03:05.400
(rumbling)

03:05.600 --> 03:06.830
Wait...

03:07.030 --> 03:09.000
Is that the dishwasher?
I think it's the dishwasher.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.870
That can't be good.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.100
(whirring)

03:12.310 --> 03:14.290
(burbling)

03:15.060 --> 03:17.740
That's where the
water's coming from.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.910
Okay, I'm calling
the repair guy.

03:20.110 --> 03:21.150
That's so expensive.

03:21.350 --> 03:22.420
We kept this
thing together

03:22.620 --> 03:23.920
with duct tape
and a prayer for a year.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.920
We can just patch it up
or something.
Honey,

03:26.120 --> 03:27.590
we're a little beyond patching.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.590
Harry, between
the dishwasher

03:28.790 --> 03:30.320
and the pipes,

03:30.520 --> 03:31.760
that's easily
$8,000 to $10,000.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.430
Are you sure we can't ask
Omega Sector for help?

03:34.630 --> 03:36.060
Honey, you know the regulations.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.230
We have to get paid exactly
like a regular computer salesman

03:39.430 --> 03:40.930
and a professor--
it's our cover ID.

03:41.130 --> 03:42.770
I know, I read
the training manual, yes.

03:42.970 --> 03:44.640
All I do is read
training manuals,

03:44.840 --> 03:46.140
but I genuinely
don't understand

03:46.340 --> 03:48.510
how we're supposed to
focus on saving the world

03:48.710 --> 03:50.540
if we're stressed
about paying for plumbing.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.710
We talked
about this.

03:51.910 --> 03:53.450
Now that you're with Omega,

03:53.650 --> 03:55.950
we have to keep our work life
and our personal life separate.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.520
It's all about
compartmentalizing.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.720
Okay, well, that might be
easy for you.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.520
No one said it was easy,
but trust me, babe,

04:01.720 --> 04:02.820
this is the only way
to keep you sane.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.190
You have to put
your homelife here

04:05.390 --> 04:06.390
and your
work life here.

04:06.590 --> 04:08.430
And you shake it all about.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.860
I get it,
Harry, I do,

04:11.060 --> 04:12.130
in theory,

04:12.330 --> 04:13.330
but you were able
to compartmentalize

04:13.530 --> 04:14.400
me for 17 years.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.340
And you went
to work-life,

04:16.540 --> 04:19.070
but I was here
with sink blobs.

04:19.270 --> 04:21.010
And, meanwhile, I
have to grade papers,

04:21.210 --> 04:23.510
I have to pick up Dana
and Jake from school,

04:23.710 --> 04:25.740
and now apparently
I have to go to training

04:25.940 --> 04:28.550
at 4:00 at Omega Sector.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.420
Well, you know, this
is an adjustment period.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.070
(phone buzzing)

04:33.070 --> 04:36.860
I assume that's
work-life calling?
Yes.

04:37.060 --> 04:38.040
I'm sorry.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.290
No, go save the world.

04:40.490 --> 04:41.980
I'm gonna battle the sink blob.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.000
No!

04:45.200 --> 04:46.720
No.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.990
* *

04:58.660 --> 05:00.900
* *

05:03.900 --> 05:06.490
Doughnuts?
What's the occasion?

05:06.690 --> 05:08.590
GIB:
This is a big one, guys.

05:08.790 --> 05:09.760
We got a lead on the Engineer.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.860
MARIA: The Engineer?
You're serious?

05:12.060 --> 05:14.590
HARRY: I've waited a long
time to hear those words.

05:14.790 --> 05:15.760
When do we leave?

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
GIB: We're not
that far along.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.130
At the moment,
all we know is,

05:18.330 --> 05:19.430
he's selling
nukes again.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.230
Some sort of ultra
portable high-yield

05:21.430 --> 05:23.100
device that we do not want
floating around.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.870
Who's the buyer?

05:25.070 --> 05:26.810
We're working on that.
But believe me,

05:27.010 --> 05:29.340
this is a priority
for everyone.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.440
We all want payback
for what happened to Ian.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.950
Bottom line--
you'll know when I do.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.450
In the meantime,

05:35.650 --> 05:37.020
I need you guys
to run up to

05:37.220 --> 05:39.100
Telonyx and file your
monthly sales reports.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.950
We already did 'em.

05:41.150 --> 05:41.920
Last month.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.320
Now you do them
this month.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.490
That's what
monthly means.

05:45.690 --> 05:46.890
Remember, guys,

05:47.090 --> 05:48.460
we maintain our cover IDs
as computer salespeople

05:48.660 --> 05:50.300
by actually working at
the computer company upstairs.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.130
So...

05:52.330 --> 05:54.650
take a doughnut
and get to work.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.090
What?
Nothing.

06:21.710 --> 06:24.400
If you make a sale, but it's
not delivered in six months,

06:24.600 --> 06:25.910
what quarter does that go in?

06:28.820 --> 06:30.470
Come on, dude.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.270
You note it in
the sales column,

06:32.470 --> 06:33.670
but the revenue
doesn't get booked

06:33.870 --> 06:35.340
until the sale goes through.
(beep)

06:35.540 --> 06:38.690
Stupid printer is jammed.

06:42.530 --> 06:45.350
Hey. You okay?

06:45.550 --> 06:46.720
Yeah. I'm fine.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.960
Luther, I saw you eat
six doughnuts

06:50.160 --> 06:52.060
when we found out we're going
after the Engineer.

06:52.260 --> 06:56.060
You remember how I was dating
Maria during that op?

06:56.260 --> 06:57.430
Everyone does.

06:57.630 --> 06:59.210
You guys know you were
on the radios, right?

07:00.620 --> 07:03.000
Well, right after that,
she broke up with me.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.500
We were on the tarmac
and she just goes,

07:05.700 --> 07:08.270
"Dude. You and me, this?

07:08.470 --> 07:10.110
We're just not
working well together."

07:10.310 --> 07:11.290
Hmm.
What?

07:12.330 --> 07:15.580
You're not looking to get
back together again, are you?

07:15.780 --> 07:16.680
No, no.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.050
That'd be... That's stupid. No.

07:19.250 --> 07:22.720
This mission just brought
back some feelings.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.490
I get it. I do.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.220
But we have
a mission to do.

07:26.420 --> 07:30.130
So put those feelings
in a box and put it away.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.060
I tried.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.230
For four years the
feelings went in the box.

07:34.430 --> 07:37.200
Now this happens,
and the box just kind of...

07:37.400 --> 07:38.870
pops back open.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.440
Luther. We are
about to go after

07:40.640 --> 07:43.910
the Engineer and prevent him
from selling a nuke.

07:44.110 --> 07:46.850
Put your feelings and
the doughnut back in the box

07:47.050 --> 07:49.130
and put it away.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.250
Something wrong?

07:53.450 --> 07:57.010
Luther was just upset
about the printer.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.530
Well, you're just gonna have
to stay at your <i>lola</i> and <i>lolo's</i>

08:05.730 --> 08:07.270
until all the repairs are done.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.070
For how long?
Grandma keeps trying to

08:09.270 --> 08:10.840
make me eat weird stuff that's

08:11.040 --> 08:12.300
"good for my bowels,"

08:12.500 --> 08:14.510
and Dana is locked in the
bathroom with her phone.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.240
Well, at least the bathroom
there works, honey, okay?
(door opens)

08:17.440 --> 08:19.010
(door closes)
You're just gonna
have to sit tight

08:19.210 --> 08:20.650
until all the plumbing
is done, all right?

08:20.850 --> 08:22.380
I love you.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.720
Huh? Hmm?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.720
Honey...

08:24.920 --> 08:26.720
it smells like mildew.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.060
Yes. Everything
smells like mildew.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.760
The entire first floor
plumbing is shot.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.330
And I sent the kids
to my parents.

08:34.530 --> 08:35.430
Wow. That bad, huh?

08:35.630 --> 08:37.130
Mm-hmm.
And the plumber says,

08:37.330 --> 08:39.730
"Y'all should've fixed
this a year ago."

08:39.930 --> 08:42.740
What I want to know is,
who's the genius

08:42.940 --> 08:44.140
who decided
to put plumbing

08:44.340 --> 08:45.140
inside of walls?

08:45.340 --> 08:46.170
How are you
supposed to know

08:46.370 --> 08:47.510
if the pipes aren't working

08:47.710 --> 08:48.670
if you can't even
see them, Harry?

08:48.870 --> 08:50.280
Harry? How are you
supposed to know?

08:50.480 --> 08:51.940
I'm doing a rant. What's
the deal with pipes?
I'm sorry.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.510
I'm sorry, I'm just...
It's a big day at work.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.520
This arms dealer that
we went after before,

08:56.720 --> 08:57.950
the Engineer?

08:58.150 --> 08:59.690
He's selling a miniaturized
nuclear weapon.

08:59.890 --> 09:01.390
(laughs)

09:01.590 --> 09:02.860
What?

09:03.060 --> 09:04.760
No, I'm just realizing it's
hard for me to rant about

09:04.960 --> 09:06.860
black mold in the walls
when you're dealing with

09:07.060 --> 09:08.330
stray nukes.

09:08.530 --> 09:09.510
(phone buzzes)

09:11.450 --> 09:12.630
What is it?

09:12.830 --> 09:15.430
I guess I get to practice
that separate work life,

09:15.630 --> 09:16.670
homelife thing.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.450
Gib wants me
at the meeting tomorrow.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.210
The Engineer
did all of this?

09:22.410 --> 09:25.410
HARRY:
Well, he built and sold
the weapons. Yeah.

09:25.610 --> 09:27.410
HELEN:
I don't get it,
he wants me to help?

09:27.610 --> 09:28.410
How?

09:28.610 --> 09:29.850
Don't worry.

09:30.050 --> 09:30.980
You're-you're probably
here just to

09:31.180 --> 09:33.890
translate documents
or something.

09:34.090 --> 09:36.220
Listen up. We got
the intel we were waiting on.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.940
And I think we finally got
our shot at the Engineer.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.290
COMPUTER:
Omega Sector sources

09:42.490 --> 09:45.030
have determined that the rogue
weapons dealer the Engineer

09:45.230 --> 09:48.200
is selling a portable
nuclear device.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.870
The buyers are
a South African fascist group

09:51.070 --> 09:53.020
known as The Noble Cross.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.110
Their representative Pieter Voss

09:56.310 --> 09:57.640
will arrive in Salzburg, Austria

09:57.840 --> 10:00.080
tomorrow to make the purchase.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.750
He will be staying
at the Luxus Resort Casino

10:02.950 --> 10:06.270
with his companion
Tiffany Mills.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.390
LUTHER:
This guy Pieter?

10:08.590 --> 10:10.890
Can we turn him,
get him to work for us?

10:11.090 --> 10:11.890
GIB:
It's not that simple.

10:12.090 --> 10:13.590
We got no leverage.

10:13.790 --> 10:14.830
So, if we try to strong-arm him,

10:15.030 --> 10:16.960
we might lose our chance
at the Engineer.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.230
We got to drive a wedge

10:18.430 --> 10:19.500
between him and
his people first.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.930
Now, Voss has a weakness
for gambling.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.470
Does he like it enough

10:23.670 --> 10:25.400
to gamble with somebody
else's nuclear bomb money?

10:25.600 --> 10:28.370
It's our job to make sure
the answer's yes.

10:28.570 --> 10:30.180
Luther, Maria?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.380
You two are our sleight
of hand experts.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.480
We'll get you into
the casino as dealers.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.510
Nice.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.480
Are you excited?
I'm excited.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.250
Your job is to make sure

10:39.450 --> 10:41.590
Voss loses the money
he needs to buy the nuke.

10:41.790 --> 10:44.420
We need him in trouble,
looking for a way out.

10:44.620 --> 10:45.590
Which bring us

10:45.790 --> 10:46.890
to Harry and Helen.

10:47.090 --> 10:49.060
What? Me? Why me?

10:49.260 --> 10:50.160
The psych guys seem to think
that we'll have

10:50.360 --> 10:51.460
better luck with a couple.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.600
So, you two go in
as rich gamblers,

10:53.800 --> 10:54.870
make friends,

10:55.070 --> 10:56.170
and when Voss is
at his most desperate,

10:56.370 --> 10:58.000
you use him to bring
us to the Engineer.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.270
Wheels up in two hours.

11:00.470 --> 11:01.410
Let's do it.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.180
Undercover? Salzburg?

11:03.380 --> 11:05.480
You know, an hour ago,
I was just plunging the sink.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.850
I got it.
Okay.

11:07.050 --> 11:07.780
Hey-hey, Gib.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.180
Gib, wait up.
(sighs)

11:09.380 --> 11:11.720
Are we sure we want to use
Helen as an undercover?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.250
We need a
convincing couple.

11:13.450 --> 11:14.490
Helen has
been training

11:14.690 --> 11:16.220
to be your wife
for 17 years, buddy.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.860
Yeah, I know she
can do it, but...

11:18.060 --> 11:19.560
No, no, there
is no "but."

11:19.760 --> 11:24.300
This is the Engineer.
This guy single-handedly gave us

11:24.500 --> 11:26.160
the biggest failure
of our careers.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.030
And a damn good MI6 agent
didn't make it

11:29.230 --> 11:30.440
home to his family.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.570
Bottom line:

11:31.770 --> 11:32.710
I'm starting to believe
in Helen.

11:32.910 --> 11:33.970
And I believe in you.

11:34.170 --> 11:36.520
And I believe
we got a plane to catch.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.360
* Power *

11:43.470 --> 11:44.920
* Yeah *

11:45.120 --> 11:45.950
* That I got that juice *

11:46.150 --> 11:47.550
* I got that plug *

11:47.750 --> 11:49.150
* I got that thunder, boom,
I'll make 'em jump *

11:49.350 --> 11:50.790
* I got that hurricane,
I make it flood *

11:50.990 --> 11:53.260
* I got that source
of power that you want, yeah *

11:53.460 --> 11:54.630
* Whoo, I got that buzz *

11:54.830 --> 11:55.830
* I got that coldest
adrenaline rush *

11:56.030 --> 11:56.830
* I got that fire *

11:57.030 --> 11:58.460
* I got that sound *

11:58.660 --> 12:00.770
* I got that new kind of power,
new kind of power *

12:00.970 --> 12:02.630
* I got that new kind of power *

12:02.840 --> 12:04.440
* Whoo, whoo *

12:04.640 --> 12:07.470
* I'm turning it louder,
louder, louder *

12:07.670 --> 12:09.570
* I got that new kind of power *

12:09.770 --> 12:11.180
* Whoo *

12:11.380 --> 12:13.110
* I got that new kind of power *

12:13.310 --> 12:15.110
* That new kind of power *

12:15.310 --> 12:16.720
* Whoo, whoo *

12:16.920 --> 12:18.720
* Power, power *

12:18.920 --> 12:20.720
* I got that new kind of power *

12:20.920 --> 12:22.540
* That new kind of power. *

12:31.510 --> 12:32.660
Hi, it's Mom.

12:32.870 --> 12:34.230
I'm sure you're out
having fun with Lola

12:34.430 --> 12:36.870
and Lolo. I just wanted
to let you know that

12:37.070 --> 12:40.340
we had to check into a motel
until all the plumbing is done.

12:40.540 --> 12:42.240
So, you know...

12:42.440 --> 12:45.190
we're roughing it, too.
Okay, love you, bye.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.600
This was on the cover of <i>Vogue.</i>

12:49.900 --> 12:51.280
Where does all this stuff
come from?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.480
The undercover guys.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.790
They do a profile
on who we should be

12:53.990 --> 12:56.450
and they buy all
the clothes and stuff.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.820
Two pairs of Louboutins?

12:59.020 --> 13:01.060
Harry, we could sell these
and pay for the plumbing.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.900
Yeah, one of these is worth
more than the dishwasher.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.500
Honey, we're spies
and now we're gonna run

13:05.700 --> 13:06.870
a secondhand shoe store?

13:07.070 --> 13:08.870
Harry, you can't, like, act

13:09.070 --> 13:10.400
like this is nothing.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.210
I mean, maybe you're used
to wearing Brioni suits...

13:13.410 --> 13:16.270
Think of it as a...
work uniform.

13:16.470 --> 13:19.510
A $10,000 work uniform. Harry,

13:19.710 --> 13:21.680
I'm buying 20-pack
chicken thighs

13:21.880 --> 13:23.750
and Mr. Freezey ice
cream to save some money

13:23.950 --> 13:25.020
to put back
for retirement.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.650
How am I just supposed
to put these on?

13:27.850 --> 13:28.950
Well, here.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.010
Let me show you.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.860
(laughing):
Oh!

13:34.060 --> 13:35.190
They hurt

13:35.390 --> 13:37.180
so bad.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.260
Aah!

13:39.460 --> 13:42.070
But they look so good.
(Harry chuckles)

13:42.270 --> 13:44.140
* *

13:44.340 --> 13:45.800
Luther, Maria,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.240
you guys on the casino roof?

13:47.440 --> 13:49.840
I need access to those
security cameras.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.880
MARIA:
Yeah, we made it up.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.480
LUTHER:
Hey, so, with us going

13:53.680 --> 13:55.580
after the Engineer...

13:55.780 --> 13:56.780
I've kind of been
thinking about

13:56.980 --> 13:58.150
when you and
I were dating.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.320
Remember how you used to
say we were a good team?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.150
We were, right?

14:02.350 --> 14:03.220
We were a good team.

14:03.420 --> 14:04.590
How come you never
say it anymore?

14:04.790 --> 14:06.220
You know we're still

14:06.420 --> 14:07.490
on the radios, right?

14:07.690 --> 14:08.890
Gib, confirm you've
just received

14:09.090 --> 14:10.300
that awkward interaction?

14:10.500 --> 14:12.180
Yep, still here.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.070
Sorry to put you
through that, Gib.

14:15.270 --> 14:19.690
Moving for the casino's
security access point now.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.140
Harry, Helen? Luther and Maria

14:23.340 --> 14:25.580
are up on the roof breaking
into the casino system.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.210
Are you two set for the initial
approach to the target?

14:29.410 --> 14:32.180
Entering the casino now.

14:32.380 --> 14:35.240
* *

14:37.010 --> 14:38.340
MAN:
Thank you, sir.

14:41.910 --> 14:43.600
Oh, you just tipped
that man 100 Euros.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.500
Did you want
to wait for change?

14:45.700 --> 14:47.000
We're rich people,
remember?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.470
I've seen rich people
get change.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.040
Don't worry
about the money.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.840
I'm not worried about
the money thing,

14:52.040 --> 14:54.870
but it's this whole
work life/homelife thing.

14:55.070 --> 14:57.240
I have ten casino chips
in my purse

14:57.440 --> 15:00.350
that could pay for
the kids' college.
Just breathe.

15:00.550 --> 15:02.250
Let's go get a drink.

15:02.450 --> 15:04.780
Two glasses of
Armand De Brignac.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.330
Of course.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.530
Okay, so, just to be clear,

15:13.730 --> 15:15.890
when you're rich,
everything costs 100 Euros?

15:16.090 --> 15:20.000
Honey, just think of it as a
fantasy that we get to live in.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.570
I'm a billionaire
shipping magnate

15:21.770 --> 15:24.500
and you're my
gorgeous trophy wife.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.940
You remember when we met?

15:26.140 --> 15:27.270
(laughs)

15:27.470 --> 15:29.440
(with European accent):
Yes, Milan.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.540
I was a swimsuit model.
(chuckles nervously)

15:32.740 --> 15:34.680
(in regular voice):
Harry, who comes up
with these scenarios?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.680
This is an HR nightmare.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.720
Remember, it's just
a story we're using

15:38.920 --> 15:40.190
to get to Voss.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.690
Speaking of...

15:41.890 --> 15:43.510
there's our boy.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.890
Hey, Harry,

15:50.100 --> 15:51.330
what if I can't do it?
What if I screw up?

15:51.530 --> 15:52.330
You won't.

15:52.530 --> 15:53.570
You're gonna do great.

15:53.770 --> 15:54.570
Shall we?

15:54.770 --> 15:57.040
Uh-huh. Hi.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.640
MARIA:
<i>All right, we are on the roof</i>

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
of the casino, drilling in now.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.640
(whirring)

16:03.840 --> 16:04.640
Looks right.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.980
GIB:
Okay.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.680
You're looking for
the main data cable.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.750
Copy that.

16:08.950 --> 16:09.980
Let you know
when we're in.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.350
I'm sorry to bring
this up again,

16:11.550 --> 16:13.590
but I just want you to
admit we were a good team.

16:13.790 --> 16:16.490
You know we're not getting
back together, right?

16:16.690 --> 16:17.790
I know that.

16:17.990 --> 16:19.690
I dated like a million
people since you.

16:19.890 --> 16:21.490
Okay, I think you mean
like three.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.730
Okay, that's not...
Oh, hey, look.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.300
There's the main data cable.

16:25.500 --> 16:29.030
Gib, we're into the data line.
You getting a signal?

16:29.230 --> 16:30.220
Boom.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.410
And we are in the corporate
system. Hey, nice work, guys.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.240
All right, showtime.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.710
Remember, we only get
one shot at this,

16:39.910 --> 16:41.930
so make it a good one, huh?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.500
CROUPIER:
Five, no field five.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.860
25 grand on hard eight.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.980
I'm feeling lucky.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.430
Here we go.
Be lucky, huh?

16:56.630 --> 16:58.050
(Helen giggles)

16:59.750 --> 17:01.930
Easy eight, easy eight.

17:02.130 --> 17:03.640
Hard eight loses.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.640
Maybe next time.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.200
(group cheering)

17:06.400 --> 17:09.120
(with accent):
Fun crowd. (laughs)

17:10.530 --> 17:11.510
It's okay.

17:11.710 --> 17:13.080
If I see
one more rich man

17:13.280 --> 17:15.300
with his trophy wife,
I'm going home.

17:16.660 --> 17:21.440
(laughs) I know.
Those girls are the worst.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.890
I make my own money.
In shipping.

17:26.090 --> 17:29.060
I'm Gloria.

17:29.260 --> 17:30.830
And this
is Marcus.

17:31.030 --> 17:34.170
He's a swimsuit model.

17:34.370 --> 17:37.540
"Mature men's sportswear,"
technically. (laughs)

17:37.740 --> 17:38.770
GIB:
Harry, Helen just

17:38.970 --> 17:40.190
switched cover IDs.
Go with it.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.480
Isn't he delicious?

17:46.680 --> 17:47.810
(Helen and Harry chuckle)

17:48.010 --> 17:49.650
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Marcus.

17:49.850 --> 17:52.380
Is this the, uh,
sexy lady section?

17:52.580 --> 17:53.650
(Helen laughs)

17:53.850 --> 17:57.270
Isn't he terrible?

17:58.140 --> 18:01.290
Pieter, Pieter. Finally
some interesting people.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.760
Gloria, Marcus, this is Pieter.

18:03.960 --> 18:04.760
I'm Tiffany.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.060
Good to meet you.

18:06.260 --> 18:07.830
Good to meet you, too.
Vacationing, huh?

18:08.030 --> 18:09.630
Little bit. Gloria's
got some work to do.

18:09.830 --> 18:10.640
How about you?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.740
Yeah, little work, too.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.470
Where you from?

18:15.670 --> 18:17.510
South Africa.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.480
That's awesome. Amazing country.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.250
We should take the jet
there sometime, kitten.

18:22.450 --> 18:25.780
I call him kitten
'cause he's so cute.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.420
That's what she calls me.
(laughs)

18:28.620 --> 18:31.190
Kitten.
(cheering)

18:31.390 --> 18:32.290
Yes!

18:32.490 --> 18:33.560
Well, let's play.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.060
Come on, shooter.
Hope you are lucky!

18:37.260 --> 18:38.330
Eh, this took a turn
for the worse.

18:38.530 --> 18:39.960
Hey, why don't we get
a drink at the bar?

18:40.160 --> 18:42.170
No, I think we're done
for the night, thanks.

18:42.370 --> 18:43.540
Got to keep 'em
on the hook, guys.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.870
Get another meeting.

18:46.070 --> 18:47.770
Oh, you're going?

18:47.970 --> 18:50.710
But everyone else
here is so boring.

18:50.910 --> 18:52.490
Do you want to meet up
tomorrow night?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.880
TIFFANY:
Please, baby, can we?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.180
Oh, fine. Why not,
for you, huh?

18:58.380 --> 18:59.750
See you.
(laughs)
Ciao.

18:59.950 --> 19:00.920
GIB:
Perfect!

19:01.120 --> 19:04.070
Helen, I could kiss you.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.030
But, uh, Luther, Maria,
a security guard's

19:08.230 --> 19:09.090
heading up to the roof
for a smoke.

19:09.290 --> 19:10.300
Get out of there.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.300
What?

19:11.500 --> 19:13.500
Go. Go. Get out of there now.

19:13.700 --> 19:14.670
Go where?

19:14.870 --> 19:16.030
I don't know, just don't
let him see you,

19:16.230 --> 19:17.370
or the op is blown.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.500
Over the side.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.000
Interesting choice.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.090
MARIA:
There's a ledge.

19:29.930 --> 19:32.420
<i>Zurück in zwei Minuten.</i>

19:32.620 --> 19:34.920
Uh, if my German translator
program is right,

19:35.120 --> 19:38.410
you got to hang on
for about two minutes.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.790
(grunts) We'll be fine.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.230
(grunts)
See?

19:44.430 --> 19:46.760
Pretty good
team, right?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.020
Depends if you fall.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.180
I just remembered that the test
comparing German and Latin

19:59.380 --> 20:00.310
declensions and conjugations

20:00.510 --> 20:02.680
will be on Tuesday.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.850
Hopefully, I'll be better
by then.

20:05.050 --> 20:08.020
Thanks for bearing with me.
Goodbye.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.290
(computer chimes)

20:09.490 --> 20:11.420
Hey, sorry to rush, but
Gib's getting anxious

20:11.620 --> 20:12.890
about us getting
down to the casino.

20:13.090 --> 20:16.080
Oh, that's okay. I'm all ready.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.270
Do I look like a billionaire?

20:21.470 --> 20:23.030
A beautiful billionaire.

20:23.230 --> 20:24.240
(laughs)

20:24.440 --> 20:26.220
Thank you, kitten.
Meow.

20:35.430 --> 20:38.770
Whoops.
Oh, I got you, kitten.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.190
It's go time, guys.

20:41.390 --> 20:43.790
I hacked into the casino
employee records and schedule.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.490
So, I got Maria and Luther
in as dealers.

20:46.690 --> 20:49.160
Harry, Helen, you're on Voss.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.730
Now, make sure you
get him betting big.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.600
But more importantly,
make sure he loses big.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.530
We need Voss nice and desperate.

20:56.730 --> 20:58.700
So he needs our help.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.690
And we can use that
to get to the Engineer.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.440
Everybody set?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.110
All set, Gib.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.930
* *

21:10.370 --> 21:11.420
(with accent):
Hey!

21:11.620 --> 21:12.980
Hey.

21:13.180 --> 21:13.990
The party people

21:14.190 --> 21:15.150
are here!

21:15.350 --> 21:16.820
Finally.
(laughs)

21:17.020 --> 21:19.260
MAN:
Now, that is the thing

21:19.460 --> 21:20.590
about valve sales is,

21:20.790 --> 21:23.360
everybody needs valves.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.800
We were going crazy without you.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
These people are so annoying.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.700
Ooh, we should
play baccarat.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.100
I'm teaching
kitten to play.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.670
Oh, honey, can we?

21:33.870 --> 21:35.010
Yeah, sure.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.610
Welcome.

21:36.810 --> 21:38.210
* Let me show you something *

21:38.410 --> 21:39.910
* Let me show you something,
it's a good life *

21:40.110 --> 21:41.880
* It's a good vibe,
it's a good time, uh *

21:42.080 --> 21:43.480
* We live it up,
let me show you something... *

21:43.680 --> 21:45.120
Come on, guys. You got this.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.080
* Little shocker with
the booty and a thong like *

21:47.280 --> 21:49.050
* Let me show you something,
looking cute as a button, yeah *

21:49.250 --> 21:50.890
* I got what they want, uh,
the boys, yeah, they love it *

21:51.090 --> 21:53.830
GIB: Remember, guys,
we need Voss to lose big.

21:54.030 --> 21:55.090
Yes, that's it!

21:55.290 --> 21:56.630
We got him!

21:56.830 --> 21:58.430
* Let's go *
* Let me show you something *

21:58.630 --> 22:00.600
* *

22:00.800 --> 22:02.600
The banker needs to make
nine to win.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.740
You need to palm that next card.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.670
* *

22:05.870 --> 22:07.470
* Here, let me
show you something *

22:07.670 --> 22:09.240
* Yeah *

22:09.440 --> 22:11.110
(groans)
Ah!

22:11.310 --> 22:13.430
* *

22:14.400 --> 22:15.910
* Yeah, let me show you
something *

22:16.110 --> 22:18.050
* Everything that you want,
yeah, I got it *

22:18.250 --> 22:19.920
* Another shot on the rocks,
yeah, I'm turning up *

22:20.120 --> 22:21.320
* Let me show you something *
All right,

22:21.520 --> 22:23.520
it looks like the draw
is gonna be a face card.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.290
* Let me show you something,
I'm about to hit that spot... *

22:26.490 --> 22:28.290
97% chance he busts.

22:28.490 --> 22:29.430
Oh, come on.

22:29.630 --> 22:30.700
GIB: Yes, that's it.

22:30.900 --> 22:31.700
Nice.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.060
* Let me tell you what *

22:33.260 --> 22:34.270
* Like this or that,
tit for tat *

22:34.470 --> 22:35.630
* I'm about to say *

22:35.830 --> 22:37.150
* Let's go, let's go *
* Yeah. *

22:42.660 --> 22:45.680
Another half-million, please.
Of course, sir.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.680
I'm worried
about Pieter.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.010
He's had
a bad run.

22:49.210 --> 22:52.450
(laughs) It happens
to everybody.

22:52.650 --> 22:55.620
That man has been at the
cashier's as much as Pieter.

22:55.820 --> 22:58.390
He can't be as
unlucky as him.

22:58.590 --> 23:01.190
I mean, look
at his hair. Wow.

23:01.390 --> 23:04.260
GIB: Okay, okay, okay, guys,
this is good.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.100
This is the third time Voss has
gone back for more cash.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.970
He's got to be down
at least a couple mil.

23:09.170 --> 23:12.020
We got to hit him hard, now.

23:14.090 --> 23:15.070
Hey.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.110
Are you sure you
want to keep playing?

23:16.310 --> 23:18.210
I have to.
I need to win.

23:18.410 --> 23:19.240
You're already down.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.080
Nobody asked you.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.950
So you keep your
stupid mouth shut, huh?

23:23.150 --> 23:24.350
Fine.

23:24.550 --> 23:26.370
I'm leaving.

23:27.970 --> 23:31.420
She'll be back
once you're up again.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.760
Why don't I let you
borrow my good luck charm,

23:33.960 --> 23:37.130
kitten, at the
blackjack table?

23:37.330 --> 23:40.050
That's where he's
his best. Come on.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you care to place a bet?

23:45.370 --> 23:46.750
(laughing)

23:47.960 --> 23:50.830
* *

23:51.990 --> 23:53.340
HARRY:
Hey, hey!

23:53.550 --> 23:54.680
Blackjack, see?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.310
Thank you.

23:56.510 --> 23:57.580
Come on, make a bet.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.720
You do bring a bit of luck, huh?

23:59.920 --> 24:00.850
Go ahead.

24:01.050 --> 24:02.970
Excellent, sir.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.520
HARRY:
Wow, that's crazy.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.030
You got to split.

24:08.230 --> 24:10.140
You always
split eights.

24:15.650 --> 24:17.030
Sir, would you care to split?

24:17.230 --> 24:19.390
This is where you make all
your money back, right here.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.860
I can feel it. Come on.
I'm a good luck charm.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.090
I will split.

24:28.630 --> 24:29.680
HARRY:
That's 11.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.980
You got to double down.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.830
(crowd gasping)

24:39.170 --> 24:40.220
The gentleman has doubled down.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.430
(crowd gasps)

24:41.630 --> 24:42.630
That's 18.

24:42.830 --> 24:44.410
HARRY:
There you go.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.420
Damn! That's a ten!

24:49.950 --> 24:52.290
You got to double down again.

24:59.730 --> 25:00.750
You're gonna win it all back,

25:00.950 --> 25:02.830
right here.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.200
LUTHER:
The gentleman has 17.

25:14.940 --> 25:17.110
MAN: No, dealer has 11,
that's not good.

25:21.450 --> 25:24.050
* *

25:28.820 --> 25:30.470
LUTHER:
21. The house wins.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.860
(crowd gasping)

25:33.900 --> 25:36.300
Better luck next time, sir.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.590
Hey, buddy, you, uh...

25:41.790 --> 25:44.790
Want to get some air outside?

25:44.990 --> 25:48.040
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'll get some air.
Yeah.

25:55.580 --> 25:57.300
GIB: All right, Harry,
we've got a lot civilians

25:57.500 --> 25:59.740
in the area and security
is manning the perimeter.

25:59.940 --> 26:03.540
Hey, Pete, buddy, we got to
talk about your situation.

26:03.740 --> 26:08.400
Yes. I think we should talk.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.120
Put the gun down, Pete.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.950
Everyone has bad
luck sometimes.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.420
I think you are my bad luck.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.820
Ever since I met you,
every bet I place I lose.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.790
It's impossible!

26:21.990 --> 26:23.660
I would never have made
those bets.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.860
We can work this out.
No, no.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.730
No, the money's gone.

26:27.930 --> 26:29.270
(gun clicks)

26:29.470 --> 26:30.470
It's over.

26:30.670 --> 26:33.490
GIB: Harry!
Harry, you all right?

26:39.490 --> 26:40.480
Bro, this is crazy.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.210
I don't control
the cards.

26:43.410 --> 26:44.350
It's just money.

26:44.550 --> 26:45.720
Only money?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.220
That money wasn't mine to lose.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.220
It was for a deal.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.490
All right.

26:51.690 --> 26:52.720
How much did you lose?

26:52.920 --> 26:54.260
Almost three million.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.530
Really? I didn't even notice.

26:56.730 --> 26:57.630
Do you know how loaded
Gloria is?

26:57.830 --> 26:58.960
She spends that on handbags.

26:59.160 --> 26:59.900
Do you think I care?

27:00.100 --> 27:01.430
The people
that I work for

27:01.630 --> 27:03.480
will kill me
for losing their money.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.200
GIB: Harry...

27:05.400 --> 27:06.770
Somebody just called security.

27:06.970 --> 27:09.440
Your man's making a scene.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.860
Get him someplace private.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.180
HARRY:
All right, listen.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.380
If I do this,
we need to trust each other.

27:17.580 --> 27:19.380
Do what?
Gloria.

27:19.580 --> 27:20.750
I wasn't kidding about her

27:20.950 --> 27:22.590
spending that kind
of dough on handbags.

27:22.790 --> 27:23.890
But if I help you,

27:24.090 --> 27:25.190
this could really
screw me over.

27:25.390 --> 27:26.260
I could lose
my meal ticket.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.890
So I need something in return.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.260
I need three million U.S. now.

27:30.460 --> 27:31.900
I'll tell her
some sob story

27:32.100 --> 27:33.930
that it was my fault that you
lost the money, blah-blah.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.900
We'll ask her
for six million.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.740
You get three and
then I get three.

27:37.940 --> 27:39.970
And you're able to do this?
Yes, absolutely.

27:40.170 --> 27:41.540
Unless you shoot me

27:41.740 --> 27:43.620
in front of all
these people.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.100
One hour.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.720
Room 566.
Yeah.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.770
All right. You got it.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.890
So, Gib...

27:59.090 --> 28:01.560
I hope you can get us
another three million in cash.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.430
Already on it,
but you're gonna be the one

28:03.630 --> 28:05.010
talking to accounting
when we get back.

28:07.010 --> 28:09.580
* *

28:13.720 --> 28:14.870
You guys ready?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.440
I got Harry and
Helen the cash for Voss.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.810
They're going to see him now.

28:18.010 --> 28:18.810
I'll let you know when
the meeting

28:19.010 --> 28:20.440
with the Engineer is set.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.050
Standing by.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.180
GIB: Also, you guys resolve
this relationship issue

28:24.380 --> 28:26.380
you've been having?
We got work to do.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.720
MARIA:
I didn't have an issue.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.090
Luther? Do you have an issue?

28:30.290 --> 28:32.120
LUTHER: No. No issue.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.660
I would just like to hear you
say that we were a good team.

28:34.860 --> 28:36.060
MARIA:
Negative on the issue
resolution, Gib.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.000
Someone can't move on.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.830
LUTHER:
Not true. Issue resolved.

28:41.030 --> 28:42.570
I've moved on.
I've totally moved on.

28:42.770 --> 28:44.070
Okay.

28:44.270 --> 28:46.440
I think we put this
on hold until

28:46.640 --> 28:48.070
we recover
that nuclear bomb.

28:48.270 --> 28:49.960
You're right, I'm sorry.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.160
Let's just go.

28:53.830 --> 28:55.850
HELEN: Voss had a
gun to your head?

28:56.050 --> 28:57.920
So what happened to the plan?
Shh, it's all the same.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.480
He just needed to
calm down a little.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.890
But he tried to shoot you.

29:01.090 --> 29:02.750
It's fine.
He lost the Noble Cross's money

29:02.950 --> 29:04.690
he was gonna use
to buy the nuke.

29:04.890 --> 29:06.790
He's afraid of his
own buddies now.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.290
He has to work with us
or he's a dead man.

29:09.490 --> 29:12.260
He leads us to the Engineer,
we're done.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.800
Oh, it's that simple?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.530
Harry, I've been doing
my best Godfather impression

29:15.730 --> 29:17.370
(phone dings)
for the past 48 hours...

29:17.570 --> 29:19.400
What is it?
It's the plumber.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.610
Okay, I'm compartmentalizing,
okay?
Okay. All right.

29:22.810 --> 29:24.180
I'm compartmentalizing.
Once he's on the hook,

29:24.380 --> 29:27.030
you're done, I'll
take care of the rest.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.950
Pieter, buddy.

29:32.150 --> 29:33.730
Hey, we're here.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.110
Pieter?

29:40.010 --> 29:42.160
Something's wrong.
I'm going in.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.460
(beeping)

29:43.660 --> 29:45.060
(door unlocks)

29:45.260 --> 29:46.910
Stay here.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.230
Okay.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.600
HARRY:
Pieter?

29:50.800 --> 29:51.600
Buddy?

29:51.800 --> 29:52.800
I think we got a problem.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.270
What? What's up?
Did Voss skip out?

29:54.470 --> 29:55.340
HARRY: No.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.040
He's dead.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.840
GIB: What?
What do you mean he's dead?

30:00.040 --> 30:02.150
Well, he's got a hole in him.
And he's not breathing.

30:02.350 --> 30:04.950
Okay... That is not good.

30:05.150 --> 30:08.050
HELEN:
No, that's really bad.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.050
His friends.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.520
The Noble Cross.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.930
They must've found out
that he lost all of their money.

30:14.130 --> 30:15.630
No, I don't think it
was the Noble Cross.

30:15.830 --> 30:17.460
We're a long way
from Cape Town.

30:17.660 --> 30:18.460
(groans)
Gib?

30:18.660 --> 30:19.560
I think he's here.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.950
Who?

30:22.250 --> 30:24.240
The Engineer.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.340
Harry, you're right.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.610
I just checked
all the outgoing emails

30:28.810 --> 30:30.070
from that room's IP address.

30:30.270 --> 30:32.830
One went out less
than ten minutes ago.

30:34.630 --> 30:37.610
It says, "Your representative
is short on funds.

30:37.810 --> 30:40.050
"I am terminating
our arrangement.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.820
And his life."

30:42.020 --> 30:43.450
Signed it, the Engineer.

30:43.650 --> 30:44.690
If he knew what happened

30:44.890 --> 30:46.090
he must've been in
the casino somewhere.

30:46.290 --> 30:47.620
Yeah, but there was a hundred
people in there.

30:47.820 --> 30:48.990
How would we know
which one he was?

30:49.190 --> 30:50.560
It had to be somebody who
knew Voss was losing.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.060
A cashier.

30:52.260 --> 30:53.830
Yeah, but the cashier can't
just run out of the cage

30:54.030 --> 30:56.470
and run upstairs
and shoot a guy.

30:56.670 --> 30:57.600
Harry, Harry.

30:57.800 --> 30:58.670
Hear my thing.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.170
What thing?

31:00.370 --> 31:01.610
The annoying guy.

31:01.810 --> 31:03.110
You know, with the combover?
Do you remember him?

31:03.310 --> 31:04.910
No. Helen,
what are you talking about?

31:05.110 --> 31:06.480
You were instructed
to watch Pieter

31:06.680 --> 31:07.510
so I was watching everyone else.

31:07.710 --> 31:08.810
You were?

31:09.010 --> 31:10.550
Yeah, it's in the
training manual. Anyways,

31:10.750 --> 31:12.380
he was at the table

31:12.580 --> 31:13.780
when we first went to meet them.

31:13.990 --> 31:15.920
And he was always
staring at Pieter

31:16.120 --> 31:17.220
every time that he was playing.

31:17.420 --> 31:19.460
Harry. He was with Pieter
at the cashier

31:19.660 --> 31:21.860
every single time that Pieter
went and got more chips.

31:22.060 --> 31:24.500
Kind of looking over
his shoulder...?

31:24.700 --> 31:25.930
I thought, "This
guy's kind of nosy."

31:26.130 --> 31:28.400
But he would've known
exactly how much money

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
Pieter lost.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.870
GIB: Running the facial
recognition now.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.540
(electronic trilling)

31:34.740 --> 31:38.010
Boom. Wow. Half a dozen hits.

31:38.210 --> 31:41.650
Perth, Zurich, Venice.

31:41.850 --> 31:43.510
See?

31:43.710 --> 31:44.950
All of these were MI6 missions.

31:45.150 --> 31:48.000
And he was following Ian
in Prague four years ago!

31:49.140 --> 31:51.410
This is him.
He's the Engineer!

31:59.950 --> 32:03.770
Okay, I'm searching the hotel's
security cameras now

32:03.970 --> 32:06.690
to see if the Engineer
is still here.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.340
Okay, he's at the valet now.

32:12.540 --> 32:14.210
He's got the nuke with him. Go.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.900
Heading down to the valet now.
Come on!

32:18.800 --> 32:20.820
GIB: Maria, Luther,
get over there.

32:21.020 --> 32:21.890
We're on our way.

32:22.090 --> 32:24.070
(tires squealing)

32:31.480 --> 32:33.930
Honey, this is
gonna be dangerous.

32:34.130 --> 32:35.100
Stay here.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.700
Harry, wait.

32:36.900 --> 32:38.570
You shouldn't drive and
shoot at the same time.
What?

32:38.770 --> 32:40.970
It's in the
training manual.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.460
I'll drive.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.760
(car alarm chirps)

32:46.530 --> 32:49.100
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

32:51.230 --> 32:55.250
Okay, he's busting a left
on the Hafnerstrasse.

32:55.450 --> 32:56.450
Am I pronouncing that right?

32:56.650 --> 32:58.020
GIB: Hafnerstrasse? Haf...?

32:58.220 --> 32:59.020
Close enough!

32:59.220 --> 33:00.710
(tires squealing)

33:02.640 --> 33:04.650
I got a visual
on the target.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.800
He saw us. He's speeding up.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.170
Do not let him crash.
There's a nuclear bomb on board.

33:14.370 --> 33:15.940
I got it!

33:16.140 --> 33:17.590
<i>We can't let him crash.</i>

33:19.190 --> 33:21.130
* *

33:24.630 --> 33:26.020
LUTHER:
The truck!

33:26.220 --> 33:28.050
The truck has a green
light, he's not gonna stop!

33:28.250 --> 33:29.500
(engine revs)

33:31.170 --> 33:32.120
Stop the truck!

33:32.320 --> 33:33.390
What?
LUTHER: Maria, go!

33:33.590 --> 33:34.490
There's a nuke in there!

33:34.690 --> 33:36.140
(tires squealing)

33:52.360 --> 33:53.310
(chuckling)

33:53.510 --> 33:55.580
Aah! Are they alive?

33:55.780 --> 33:56.950
GIB: They're alive.

33:57.150 --> 33:59.800
I got heartbeats.
Get to the Engineer.

34:06.470 --> 34:07.920
Maria? Luther?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.230
I hit my head.

34:09.430 --> 34:10.530
MARIA: We'll be fine.

34:10.730 --> 34:12.030
Just don't let the
Engineer get away.

34:12.230 --> 34:13.950
(engine revving)

34:15.150 --> 34:17.730
Harry, Helen.
How close are you?

34:17.930 --> 34:19.650
Approaching the target now.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.430
(exclaims)

34:30.330 --> 34:31.570
Aah!

34:33.700 --> 34:34.820
Harry, if something

34:35.020 --> 34:35.990
goes wrong,
you're gonna take out

34:36.190 --> 34:37.020
five miles of Salzburg!

34:37.220 --> 34:38.190
No shooting!

34:38.390 --> 34:39.820
No shooting?

34:40.020 --> 34:41.490
What are we supposed to do, Gib?

34:41.690 --> 34:43.030
Follow him until
he runs out of gas?

34:43.230 --> 34:45.500
You're the field op,
I just assess the threat.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.580
Figure it out!

34:49.980 --> 34:51.340
Can you get alongside the car?

34:51.540 --> 34:52.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you gonna do?

34:52.940 --> 34:55.520
You don't want to know.
What?

34:58.160 --> 34:59.240
Turns, aah!

34:59.440 --> 35:02.010
I can't do this!
I can't do this!

35:02.210 --> 35:04.050
Just get as close as you can.
You're doing great.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.570
I'm proud of you, honey.
Okay, thanks.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.520
Harry, my peripheral vision

35:09.720 --> 35:11.470
sees your feet getting
out the window!

35:13.610 --> 35:14.890
(gunshots)

35:15.090 --> 35:16.190
Aah!

35:16.390 --> 35:18.150
(gunfire continues)

35:18.980 --> 35:20.250
Harry, get down.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.130
Get down. Get down.

35:23.330 --> 35:24.520
Harry, get down.

35:27.350 --> 35:28.790
Aah!

35:31.190 --> 35:32.890
Oh, my God!

35:35.360 --> 35:36.830
(tires squealing)
(grunting)

35:45.410 --> 35:46.840
(tires squealing)

35:50.880 --> 35:52.180
(grunts)

35:54.280 --> 35:56.020
Nice try.

35:57.350 --> 35:58.950
(shaky breath)

35:59.890 --> 36:02.090
(indistinct radio chatter)

36:03.890 --> 36:05.280
I'm dizzy.
(laughs)

36:05.480 --> 36:07.210
They gave you some drugs, so...

36:07.410 --> 36:08.380
Yeah, they did.

36:08.580 --> 36:09.910
(laughs)

36:10.110 --> 36:11.880
The bomb didn't go off, right?

36:12.080 --> 36:13.620
No, the bomb didn't go off.

36:13.820 --> 36:16.350
Because you figured out that we
should crash into that truck.

36:16.550 --> 36:19.320
That was dangerous.
Yeah.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.860
It was.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.290
Maria...

36:23.490 --> 36:24.630
I'm sorry.

36:24.830 --> 36:27.030
I'm sorry I couldn't
let the team thing go.

36:27.230 --> 36:31.740
Thing is, I just miss
the old days.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.040
And I know
you don't.

36:34.240 --> 36:38.680
I'll be honest, it makes me sad
in here, in my heart.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.210
But I accept it.

36:40.410 --> 36:44.920
I was just stupid.
I was being stupid. I'm stupid.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.700
You're not...

36:47.470 --> 36:49.300
...stupid.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.820
We were a good team.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.330
Oh.
There, I said it.

36:56.530 --> 36:58.350
I knew it.

37:00.810 --> 37:03.180
That's why I broke up with you.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.600
When Ian got killed,

37:07.800 --> 37:10.070
I realized...

37:10.270 --> 37:14.140
you were supposed
to be with him.

37:14.350 --> 37:18.130
You would've died too.
So, that...

37:20.070 --> 37:23.300
I can't lose someone I care
about like that, I...

37:24.610 --> 37:26.270
(snoring)

37:34.520 --> 37:36.700
Nice work, guys.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.200
That one was for Ian
and our friends at MI6.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.410
We got a nuclear bomb
off the streets.

37:42.610 --> 37:45.380
And the Engineer's gonna spend
the next several decades

37:45.580 --> 37:48.230
in a nice, cozy cement box.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.030
Let's pack it up and get home.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.570
I'm gonna miss you.

38:11.770 --> 38:13.740
And you.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.110
And you most of all. (chuckles)

38:16.310 --> 38:17.540
You okay?

38:17.740 --> 38:19.080
Yeah, no, I'm good.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.060
I get it more now, you know?
Separating work and life.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.880
You can't jump
out of a car

38:25.080 --> 38:26.550
to stop a guy with a nuclear
bomb if you're worried

38:26.750 --> 38:29.090
about the slime that's growing
underneath your floorboards.

38:29.290 --> 38:30.370
(chuckles)

38:31.270 --> 38:35.560
You just have to do the job,
stuff it away, and...

38:35.760 --> 38:37.430
zip it all up.

38:37.630 --> 38:39.100
Yeah, about that.

38:39.300 --> 38:42.870
The only reason why I was good
at compartmentalizing

38:43.070 --> 38:44.500
is because you were at home

38:44.700 --> 38:46.300
in the other
compartment,

38:46.500 --> 38:47.770
handling things.

38:47.970 --> 38:50.570
It's time I started worrying
about the dishwasher.

38:50.770 --> 38:52.110
What does that mean?

38:52.310 --> 38:53.810
I called Omega.

38:54.010 --> 38:55.680
I pointed out how
our little slime problem

38:55.880 --> 38:57.910
could ruin our $30
million security system.

38:58.110 --> 38:59.480
Mm-hmm.
So they're
sending a team out

38:59.680 --> 39:03.150
and they're replacing the
pipes and the dishwasher.

39:03.350 --> 39:05.090
Oh, my gosh!

39:05.290 --> 39:06.940
That's amazing.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.890
As long as we're
mixing our work life

39:11.090 --> 39:12.430
