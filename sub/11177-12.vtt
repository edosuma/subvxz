00:02.080 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:21.840 --> 00:24.560
<i>It was Michael's sister's anniversary.
- Hi.</i>

00:24.640 --> 00:27.200
<i>He'd convinced his mother
to throw a party for her.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:29.120
Lindsay, how's this for
an anniversary cake?

00:29.200 --> 00:32.960
Anniversary? You asked me
to throw a Valentine's Day party.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.200
- Did I?
- You tricked me.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.659
<i>I deceived you, Mom. Tricked makes</i>

00:36.660 --> 00:38.360
<i>it sound like we have
a playful relationship.</i>

00:38.440 --> 00:41.680
TouchÃ©. Lupe, untie the balloons!

00:44.160 --> 00:46.600
<i>Michael, all alone
on Valentine's Day?</i>

00:46.720 --> 00:48.600
How's that possible?

00:48.680 --> 00:50.520
You seem like such a romantic to me.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.520
<i>I- I-I can just see you showing up
on some lucky girl's porch...</i>

00:54.640 --> 00:57.600
in a tuxedo
with a bottle of champagne.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.600
Yeah. Well, if I show up
with all that stuff...

00:59.680 --> 01:01.760
I could probably just get away
with shorts and a T-shirt, right?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.760
Which is good
'cause I don't even have a tuxedo.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.680
So you're saying there's no one
you're even interested in?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.000
<i>In fact,
Michael had become enamored of Marta...</i>

01:09.120 --> 01:12.040
<i>when Gob was having second thoughts
about the relationship.</i>

01:12.160 --> 01:15.080
<i>- I've made a huge mistake.
- But when Gob recommitted to her...</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:16.400
<i>- I've made a huge mistake.</i>

01:16.401 --> 01:18.680
- Michael decided to do the
noble thing and let her go.

01:18.760 --> 01:23.000
There was somebody for a while,
but it was too much of a brother... bother.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.040
<i>That can't feel good.</i>

01:32.160 --> 01:34.400
It's fine. I'm over it.
I'm okay by myself, you know?

01:34.520 --> 01:37.280
I really just want to focus
on my family's happiness.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.160
That's why I threw this party.
I mean, 14 years, huh?

01:40.280 --> 01:42.080
You've got to be doing
somethin' right.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.720
Well, if you call not filing
for divorce "something right. "

01:44.800 --> 01:46.800
- But I guess we keep it interesting.
- Where's Tobias?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.240
He's on the balcony having margaritas
with Carl Weathers.

01:49.320 --> 01:53.120
<i>Tobias had recently
hired actor Carl Weathers as a drama coach.</i>

01:53.240 --> 01:55.400
Do you see me more as
the respected dramatic actor...

01:55.520 --> 01:57.520
or more the beloved comic actor?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's still plenty of meat on that bone.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.520
You take this home, throw it in a pot.
Add some broth, a potato...

02:03.600 --> 02:06.040
Baby, you got a stew goin'.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.039
Yes, that's fine. But I would like to focus
on my acting, Mr. Weathers.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.360
I did give you my last $1,100.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.280
Let me tell you a little story
about acting.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.600
<i>I was doing this Showtime movie,
Hot Ice, with Anne Archer.</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:20.120
Never once touched my per diem.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.560
I go to craft service, get some raw veggies,
bacon, cup of soup...

02:23.680 --> 02:26.080
Baby, I had a stew goin'.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.280
I think I'd like my money back.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.240
<i>Like his father, George Michael
had been nursing an impossible crush.</i>

02:38.360 --> 02:40.160
<i>It was on his cousin, Maeby.</i>

02:40.280 --> 02:44.040
<i>And with no one to talk to,
he was looking for some kind of direction.</i>

02:44.160 --> 02:46.640
just give me a sign.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.920
First one's obvious. Okay.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.480
<i>He continued to look for a sign.</i>

02:55.560 --> 02:58.320
<i>- Until finally...
- "Maybe tonight. "</i>

02:58.400 --> 03:00.320
What are the chances?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.440
<i>Actually, "Maybe Tonight"
was a very popular candy slogan...</i>

03:03.520 --> 03:05.360
<i>and the chances were one in eight.</i>

03:05.440 --> 03:06.280
- What are you doin'?

03:06.281 --> 03:08.280
- Just tryin' to throw
stuff at my dad's head...

03:08.360 --> 03:10.560
- but the wind keeps taking it.
- Oh, cool.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.480
So, I, uh... I found this.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.357
I thought it was like a
one-in-a-million thing.

03:14.358 --> 03:15.480
It just made me think of you.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.520
- Oh, perfect.
- Trying to make my relation...

03:19.640 --> 03:21.720
<i>- I saw that.
- And Lucille...</i>

03:21.800 --> 03:24.400
<i>found a way to force a wedge
into her son's relationship.</i>

03:24.480 --> 03:27.480
Lucille, guess who's coming to dinner?

03:27.560 --> 03:30.920
I've invited Carl
to dine with us next Tuesday.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.120
Mother, you know
I have class on Tuesday.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.880
Oh, how silly of me.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.160
Well, then perhaps the two of you
can have dinner alone.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.720
Oh, well, I never say no to dinner,
with a beautiful lady that is.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.880
- Do you like ham?
- No. I love it.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
<i>And the family gathered
to watch a videotape...</i>

03:53.720 --> 03:56.880
<i>George Sr. had sent Lindsay and Tobias
for their anniversary.</i>

03:56.960 --> 03:59.800
Hello, I'm George Bluth...

03:59.880 --> 04:02.280
and for the next 45 minutes...

04:02.400 --> 04:04.640
let me take you on a journey...

04:04.760 --> 04:07.800
Good grief. He sent us
one of his idiot videotapes.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.720
<i>First this...
- You've seen George Bluth on videotape.</i>

04:10.800 --> 04:13.680
You have got to learn
to be alone.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.120
I cheated and I lied.
And I whored around.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.240
<i>Caged Wisdom changed my life.</i>

04:20.320 --> 04:23.400
<i>Now is your chance to own the entire
George Bluth Caged Wisdom library...</i>

04:23.520 --> 04:25.320
for only four payments of 19.95.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.497
- This was supposed to
be my anniversary toast.

04:27.498 --> 04:27.840
- Yeah.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.920
And this was supposed to be
my Valentine's Day party.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.840
Speaking of which...

04:32.960 --> 04:34.880
Lupe, where are those balloons?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.960
<i>You want balloons?</i>

04:38.880 --> 04:41.600
Speech, speech, speech...

04:41.720 --> 04:45.680
{Joining In]
Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech...

04:45.760 --> 04:48.640
speech, speech, speech speech...

04:48.760 --> 04:50.760
- Come on, speech.
- Speech, speech, speech, speech...

04:50.880 --> 04:54.160
<i>The family continued
to chant, "Speech, speech, speech'...</i>

04:54.240 --> 04:56.480
<i>for no one in particular.</i>

04:56.600 --> 04:58.760
- Speech, speech...
- All right.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.680
Speech.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.520
After all that, I was kinda hoping
somebody would make a speech.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.537
- Speech, speech, speech...

05:06.538 --> 05:08.480
- All right, all right, all
right. I'll say something.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.080
<i>- Typical.
- We've all had a tough couple of months.</i>

05:11.200 --> 05:13.640
I think we're all really
figuring out who we are...

05:13.760 --> 05:15.560
and what we really need in life.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.240
<i>And that can be painful.</i>

05:18.360 --> 05:21.920
However, you can't really heal yourself
until you stop living a lie, you know.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.760
<i>But, uh, I-I promise that we're all
gonna be a lot happier in the long run.</i>

05:25.880 --> 05:28.000
So, on a very unusual
Valentine's Day...

05:28.080 --> 05:32.360
cheers to Mom and Dad,
to Buster and Lucille...

05:32.480 --> 05:35.560
- Don't forget my girlfriend.
- That's who I meant.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.080
To Lindsay and Tobias,
to George Michael and...

05:39.200 --> 05:41.840
I almost said George Michael and Maeby.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.040
- Oh.
- Um, to Gob and Marta.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.200
<i>- Mmm.
- To love and happiness.</i>

05:47.320 --> 05:50.000
I love you all, Marta.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.560
<i>And Marta realized it
was Michael, not Gob...</i>

05:52.640 --> 05:55.600
<i>who had everything
she had been looking for in a man.</i>

05:55.680 --> 05:58.240
I made a huge mistake.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.480
<i>I was thinking about that toast
you gave at my anniversary party.</i>

06:06.560 --> 06:09.480
- So, I want to get a divorce.
- What?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.365
Do you think I should
use our attorney, Barry,

06:11.366 --> 06:12.680
or just kind of bolt in the night?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.600
I'm leaning toward bolt
in the night, but...

06:14.720 --> 06:17.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lindsay,
I wasn't talking about getting a divorce.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.920
<i>Oh, Michael.
It's time.</i>

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
The man's psychologically incapable
of taking all of his clothes off.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.400
<i>In fact,
Tobias was a never-nude.</i>

06:26.480 --> 06:29.600
<i>As of yet, the D.S.M. -IV
has not acknowledged the affliction.</i>

06:29.720 --> 06:32.680
I don't know, Lindsay.
I mean, who am I to judge?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.640
On the other hand,
I am doing it anyway...

06:34.720 --> 06:38.560
so let me suggest before you talk divorce,
at least consider a separation.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.480
- You know, you do have a kid.
- I know.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.080
I was gonna take her with me in the night.
She's part of the bolt.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.000
Lindsay.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.160
All right. I'll think about it.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.360
- Hello?
- Hey, brother.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.400
I just want to tell you how much
I enjoyed your speech yesterday.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.440
You know, about family and...
and being true to ourselves.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.840
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm glad it made an impact.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.040
Yeah. I never want
to look at Mom again.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.960
What happened?

07:05.080 --> 07:08.640
Well, I can't really talk.
She might be listening in.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.680
<i>Do you know she tried to set up
my girlfriend with a man?</i>

07:11.800 --> 07:14.200
This has to stop.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.160
You know, that's not really
what I was going for.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.840
I'm a man, Mike!
I'm a man.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.760
Can I throw out this yogurt?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.680
Buster, two things.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.120
First of all, I think it might be time
for you to move out, you know?

07:26.240 --> 07:29.720
Secondly, you don't want to take any chances
with yogurt, Mom. Just let her throw it out.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.760
- He-Hello? Who's on this phone?
- Hey. Huh?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.240
<i>- Michael?
- Hey.</i>

07:36.320 --> 07:37.416
<i>- Great speech last night.</i>

07:37.417 --> 07:39.720
- Oh, really? What did it
inspire you to do, kill somebody?

07:39.840 --> 07:41.640
<i>Getting there.
Marta's cheating on me.</i>

07:41.760 --> 07:43.880
- What?
- Yeah, can you believe that?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.839
That's crazy, Gob. She's not a cheater.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.480
If she were to cheat, I'd
like to think she'd cheat...

07:48.600 --> 07:50.800
- You're the cheater.
- That's how I know all the signs.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.040
Last night she was all distant and weird.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.120
Wouldn't let me make love to her
on Mom's bed.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.520
I don't even want to tell you what she
wouldn't let me do to her in the car.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.640
And then today, I overhear her talking on
the phone about somebody all super silently.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.560
All in Spanish.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.720
<i>In fact, Marta was on the phone
with her mother talking about Michael.</i>

08:11.600 --> 08:13.640
<i>Hermano.</i>

08:13.760 --> 08:17.080
She kept using this guy's name,
like, "Hermano. "

08:17.200 --> 08:18.217
Let me tell you something.

08:18.218 --> 08:20.800
We're gonna track this "Hermano"
down, and we're gonna nail him.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.484
'Cause if anyone's gonna
go out with that girl,

08:22.485 --> 08:23.320
it's gonna be one of us.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.840
- Right. Me.
- And I'm okay with that.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.320
I don't get it.
Why do we have to change rooms?

08:30.400 --> 08:33.280
Cousins of the opposite gender
shouldn't be sharing a room.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.424
But that's just the point.
I mean, we're cousins.

08:35.424 --> 08:36.799
Gender has nothing to do with it.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.679
I mean, cousins can bunk together.
That's why they call it "bunkin' cousins. "

08:39.760 --> 08:43.039
- "Kissin' cousins. "
- We're not kissing! That's the point!

08:43.120 --> 08:45.920
<i>George Michael was concerned
that Tobias had seen the candy heart...</i>

08:46.040 --> 08:49.360
<i>that said "Maybe Tonight"and had figured out
that he had a crush on his cousin.</i>

08:49.440 --> 08:52.560
Besides, I don't even care. You said share
a room with her, I shared a room with her.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.301
Now you're saying don't
share a room with her.

08:54.302 --> 08:55.680
Fine. I'm just doing whatever you say.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.072
You know, the adults making
all the decisions around here.

08:58.073 --> 08:58.880
Why am I in trouble?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.077
You're not in trouble.

09:00.078 --> 09:02.720
We're all just gonna have
a more normal arrangement.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.040
I'm gonna sleep with my daughter,
and you're gonna sleep with my husband.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.320
<i>Buster had taken Michael's advice
and decided to confront his mother.</i>

09:13.440 --> 09:16.720
"Because you know I don't
appreciate how you treat me.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.640
I am not a child, Mother. "

09:22.000 --> 09:24.440
Blow.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.200
No, Mother!
I can blow myself.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.320
And you have interfered
for the last time.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.600
Fine. Go! Move out.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.640
<i>So, Buster loaded up his possessions...</i>

09:44.720 --> 09:46.760
<i>and emancipated himself
from his mother.</i>

09:55.160 --> 09:57.520
Oh, hey, Buster.
I thought you had class.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.320
I thought you had class.
My brother-in-law fires you...

10:00.440 --> 10:02.760
- and you move in on my girlfriend?
- Come on now. Wait a minute.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.560
This is purely a social call. You know,
just two adults gettin' a stew on, man.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.760
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds disgusting.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.520
Hey, Buster.
Gee, I thought you had class.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.840
<i>I thought you had class!</i>

10:16.280 --> 10:18.080
I want to move in with you.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.960
I'm tired of my mom
trying to control me.

10:21.040 --> 10:21.831
Wait a minute.

10:21.832 --> 10:25.560
Are you sure you're doing this
because you want to be with me...

10:25.640 --> 10:28.261
- and not because you want
to get even with your mother?

10:28.262 --> 10:29.640
- This isn't about my mother.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.400
Besides, it's the only way
I'm ever gonna get her to respect me.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.160
Buster, this is exactly why
our relationship does not work.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.480
- Our relationship doesn't work?

10:37.481 --> 10:40.000
- Not as long as you keep getting
me mixed up with your mother.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.200
It is exactly the opposite.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.480
<i>I'm leaving my mother for you.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:46.960
You're replacing my mother.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.960
You need some time.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.880
Huh?

11:09.840 --> 11:13.240
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was
following Marta to confirm...</i>

11:13.360 --> 11:15.320
<i>Gob's suspicions about her affair.</i>

11:15.440 --> 11:18.360
<i>First, he saw her buy a present
at an exclusive men's store.</i>

11:18.480 --> 11:23.280
<i>The trail then led Michael to the set
of Marta's Spanish language soap opera.</i>

11:23.360 --> 11:25.520
Excuse me. I'm looking for "Hermano. "

11:25.600 --> 11:27.114
<i>- ? Mi hermano? Ahi.</i>

11:27.115 --> 11:27.640
- Mmm.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.760
<i>- There, in the green?
Great, thanks. Gracias.</i>

11:30.761 --> 11:31.360
- Mm
-hmm.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.120
"Hermano. "

11:35.200 --> 11:36.258
<i>- Are you "Hermano"?</i>

11:36.259 --> 11:37.040
- ? Mi hermano?

11:37.120 --> 11:39.080
<i>Es ahi.</i>

11:39.200 --> 11:41.760
- That's the guy who just...
- Mm-hmm.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.280
Son of a bitch.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.720
Hey.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.040
Marta.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.280
<i>I had to see you.
He moved out.</i>

12:04.360 --> 12:06.400
Moved out? Buster did?

12:06.520 --> 12:08.452
- I know it's for his
own good, but I'm worried.

12:08.453 --> 12:09.320
- He's gonna be fine.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.040
I'm not worried about him.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.520
I've never lived
in the apartment alone.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.720
- I'm not sure I'm up to this.
- All right. Shh, shh, shh.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.880
Listen. I know you think
I'm going after the $49...

12:20.000 --> 12:23.640
<i>but I want... I want you to watch
a little Caged Wisdom.</i>

12:23.720 --> 12:27.560
- Not this garbage again.
- There is joy in solitude, Lucille.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.640
Try being alone.
I- I-It just might make you happier.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.360
Honey, my happiest times here
are alone.

12:36.360 --> 12:40.640
Hey, Bruno, any chance that the hole
is available between 4:00 and 6:00?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.160
I don't even want to know
what that means.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.640
<i>With nowhere else to go,
Buster arrived at the model home.</i>

12:45.760 --> 12:48.320
- Buster Bluth.
- Hey, Brother-in-law.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.520
Good news.
Carl got me an audition.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.368
- Carl Weathers?

12:52.369 --> 12:54.720
- I think the world is
about to fall in love...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.720
with "Frightened Inmate #2."

12:57.840 --> 13:01.200
Well, at least he gave you something.
Carl Weathers took everything from me.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.880
My entire life just came crashing down,
and it's all his fault.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.080
I will never love again.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.120
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.560
<i>- Is everything okay?
- And suddenly...</i>

13:11.680 --> 13:14.880
<i>Buster realized Marta was
the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:16.800
I've been dating an old lady.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.680
Is Michael here?

13:18.760 --> 13:21.400
<i>- I-I don't... I don't know where he is.
- In fact...</i>

13:21.480 --> 13:23.880
<i>Michael was just returning
from his day of following Marta.</i>

13:24.000 --> 13:26.080
<i>Well, I lost her.</i>

13:26.200 --> 13:28.440
<i>- Michael.
- Marta.</i>

13:28.520 --> 13:31.200
- I'm so glad I caught you.
- You caught me?

13:31.280 --> 13:33.120
- Yes.
- Oh.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.640
First of all, thank you so much
for the lovely party...

13:35.720 --> 13:38.600
and for making me feel
so welcome in your family.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.000
- Yeah, sure.
- We love you!

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
Can I... Can I stay here
for a little while?

13:44.680 --> 13:46.560
Everybody's already sharing
a bedroom but me, Buster.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.080
Oh, perfect.

13:49.160 --> 13:53.360
So, I was hoping you might
have some time to talk.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.680
There's something I need...

13:55.800 --> 13:58.200
- Maybe we could have dinner?
- Hello.

13:58.280 --> 14:02.080
She's at the house.
She's at the house!

14:02.160 --> 14:02.812
- One second.

14:02.813 --> 14:05.720
- I'm gonna speak very
carefully in case she's with you.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.000
- You're right.
- Right about what? She's there?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.680
What's going on? Who's with you?
If it's Marta, say "nobody. "

14:10.760 --> 14:12.720
- Nobody.
- Well, now I don't know what's going on.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.160
So, did you find out anything?
I- I'm dying here, Michael.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.680
- D-Did you find that guy? What's his name?
- "Hermano. "

14:18.760 --> 14:20.760
- "Hermano. "
- Is that your brother?

14:20.840 --> 14:22.600
Hmm? No. He's upstairs, remember?

14:22.720 --> 14:25.720
Listen, I gotta go. Somebody wants
to take me out to dinner.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
- Somebody?
- Nobody.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.893
- Why don't I just come
in? I'm right outside.

14:29.894 --> 14:31.320
- No, no. Not... Not a good idea.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.920
Somebody wants to talk to me
about something.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.200
Ah, she wants
to talk to you. Got it.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.360
For some reason
women feel safe around you.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.320
Maybe because you've only
had sex four times.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.360
Four women! Not four times!
And they talk to me because I talk to them.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.320
Look, go to dinner. Let's get to
the bottom of this "Hermano" stuff, brother.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.760
- Yep. Great.
- Great.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.760
Hey, about dinner,
I'd love to.

14:56.040 --> 15:00.920
<i>Tobias arrived at his audition
for "Frightened Inmate #2."</i>

15:03.840 --> 15:05.616
<i>The competition frightened Tobias,</i>

15:05.617 --> 15:07.920
which he felt he could
use in his performance.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.160
<i>Unfortunately this made him
more confident...</i>

15:10.240 --> 15:12.800
<i>which frightened him again.</i>

15:12.920 --> 15:14.720
I'm ready.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.960
<i>That night, Maeby moved
in to Lindsay's room.</i>

15:17.080 --> 15:20.280
Isn't this fun?
It's like a slumber party.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.560
Hmm.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.840
That's it! Tell me what's up
with you and Dad.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.880
Nothing. Nothing's wrong
with your father and me.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.720
We have a... a wonderful,
close relationship.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.880
Can I let you in
on a little secret?

15:33.960 --> 15:38.520
Hmm? Having him in the next room
makes me miss him all the more.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.680
Mom, please. He's got a big-boy crush
on Action Jackson.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.000
I know. How can I compete with that?

15:45.120 --> 15:49.600
Okay. We're having
a little fight right now.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.320
But don't worry, darling. Okay?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.280
Mommy and Daddy
aren't going anywhere.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.560
Okay. I'm gonna go
unpack my suitcase.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.320
No! We may have to bolt.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.840
<i>Tobias moved in to George Michael's room.</i>

16:02.920 --> 16:05.400
Maeby and I were cool with each other.
And you must miss your wife.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.320
It's practically still
your anniversary.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.760
Fourteen years of lies.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.640
Yes, I'm the doctor.
The perfect husband.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.720
The big manly man.
The big strong daddy.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.680
Do you know the last time
that I made love to my wife?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.520
- No.
- I'll tell you when.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.880
- No, don't.
- See, nothing has ever been easy for us.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
<i>I mean, the only reason she went out with me
was to piss offher boyfriend.</i>

16:26.080 --> 16:29.280
The only reason she ever married me
was to piss off her mother.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.520
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive.
So there was that famous ordeal.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.200
Wh-What do you mean you couldn't
conceive? Was Maeby adopted?

16:36.320 --> 16:39.320
What? Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

16:39.400 --> 16:42.920
Ah, it's Carl Weathers.
Yes, Carl Weathers.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.600
I did? That's... That's wonderful.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.760
<i>That's...</i>

16:48.880 --> 16:51.400
Huh! I booked it!
I booked the acting job!

16:51.520 --> 16:52.826
Did you hear that, Lindsay?

16:52.827 --> 16:55.680
You could have been sleeping
with "Frightened Inmate #2."

16:58.720 --> 17:02.360
<i>And Lucille was experiencing
being alone for the first time.</i>

17:03.920 --> 17:06.800
<i>Unable to sleep,
she decided to watch TV.</i>

17:06.880 --> 17:09.880
You have got to learn to be alone.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.319
<i>Then she remembered
that with no one to disturb...</i>

17:12.400 --> 17:14.520
<i>she could turn up the volume
as loud as she wanted.</i>

17:14.599 --> 17:18.720
<i>Caged Wisdom teaches you that you
have to find thejoy within yourself.</i>

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
<i>And that's when Lucille realized...</i>

17:23.520 --> 17:26.560
<i>that shejust might like
being alone after all.</i>

17:30.920 --> 17:34.360
<i>The next night, Michael had
dinner with Marta at her house...</i>

17:34.440 --> 17:37.440
<i>hoping to finally get
the answers he was looking for.</i>

17:37.560 --> 17:40.920
So, um, about Gob.
How's that goin'?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.560
Well, as you said...

17:43.680 --> 17:46.280
finding out who you really are,
it can be painful.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.120
- But you can't live a lie.
- No, I can't.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.520
But some people find a way
to make that work.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.640
Yes, but sometimes
working at something...

17:54.720 --> 17:57.120
it's a way to not deal
with some other thing.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.080
But he who often suggests...

18:01.160 --> 18:03.000
uh, working on another thing...

18:03.080 --> 18:05.760
- which when the first thing is not...
- Will you excuse me for a moment?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.280
Yes. Sure.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.680
- What the hell is he talking about?
- What is she talking about?

18:11.760 --> 18:14.680
<i>- Can I have a piece of cake?
- And Michael saw an opportunity...</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.960
<i>to get the information
he wasn't getting from Marta from her son.</i>

18:18.080 --> 18:20.760
I'll tell you what.
I got... I got a deal for you, partner.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.800
I'll give you what you want...

18:24.920 --> 18:26.840
if you give me what I want.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.320
Tell me everything
you know about... "Hermano. "

18:31.400 --> 18:34.040
<i>- ? Hermano?
- Does your mother love "Hermano?"</i>

18:34.120 --> 18:36.480
<i>Si, mi hermano.</i>

18:36.560 --> 18:39.560
- He's here?
- Shh. He's sleeping.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.449
- Don't go in there.

18:42.450 --> 18:45.440
- Why? Is there something
you don't want me to see?

18:45.560 --> 18:48.120
- What are you talking about?
- We can keep going around in circles...

18:48.200 --> 18:50.680
but maybe one of us should just come out
and say what it is we want to say.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.640
You're right.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.120
- It's not working with Gob.
- Why doesn't he know that?

18:56.200 --> 18:58.200
You know you could have
just come out and told him...

18:58.280 --> 19:01.120
you know, instead of lying and sneaking
around, moving on to the next guy.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.099
I didn't think you were
that kind of a person.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.840
I thought you and I
shared the same values.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.240
I thought you and I
could've been, uh...

19:09.240 --> 19:13.000
No, forget it. Eh... I don't know
how I had you so wrong.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.520
You're right.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.920
I should have told him
before I invited you here.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.400
This can never be.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.960
<i>Then he noticed the
gift he had seen her buy.</i>

19:41.160 --> 19:44.200
- What does "te amo" mean?
- I love you.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.600
Hmm.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.120
And who's in there?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.560
<i>Mi hermano.</i>

19:54.600 --> 19:57.160
Brother.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.960
I've made a huge mistake.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

20:02.760 --> 20:05.120
<i>George Michael

20:05.200 --> 20:08.040
So, you wanna go
to the movies? Ow!

20:08.160 --> 20:10.680
I'll let you know when I get back
from the lab.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.640
<i>Tobias faces his greatest
acting challenge.</i>

20:12.760 --> 20:14.880
There's a shower scene?
I have to be nude.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.400
Well, you don't shower
with your clothes on, now, do ya?

20:18.760 --> 20:21.440
<i>And Buster rebounds
from Lucille 2.</i>

20:21.520 --> 20:24.440

<i>Te amo, Marta.
Te amo.</i>
