00:34.100 --> 00:37.469
And on this fateful day,
by harnessing the power

00:37.471 --> 00:42.674
of electricity, Rallo Tubbs
will transform himself into...

00:42.676 --> 00:46.545
Electro-Boy!

00:46.547 --> 00:48.213
CLEVELAND:
Kids! Dinner!

00:48.215 --> 00:50.449
Coming!

00:50.451 --> 00:53.552
Ahh!

00:57.457 --> 00:58.857
Donna?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.292
Donna!

01:00.294 --> 01:01.360
Where's dinner?

01:01.362 --> 01:04.296
Donna!

01:04.298 --> 01:05.664
Donna?

01:05.666 --> 01:09.168
She's gone. There's...
there's... nothing!

01:09.170 --> 01:10.302
No dinner?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.471
(high-pitched screaming)

01:12.473 --> 01:13.872
(screams)

01:13.874 --> 01:15.340
(all screaming)

01:21.514 --> 01:23.482
(screaming weakly)

01:23.484 --> 01:25.284
Sweet mayhem and...

01:25.286 --> 01:26.285
(sighs)

01:26.287 --> 01:28.020
I'm about done with these.

01:28.022 --> 01:29.088
What the hell happened?!

01:29.090 --> 01:31.290
It was 6:00 and
there was no dinner.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.459
It's only 6:15!

01:33.461 --> 01:35.294
We eat at 6:00.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.295
Where were you?

01:36.297 --> 01:37.830
At my woman's
group meeting.

01:37.832 --> 01:42.801
You know, Nags Against
Global Sexism, or NAGS.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.870
Kendra, Arianna, and I are
doing some amazing things

01:44.872 --> 01:47.473
to help women help women
help women all over the world.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.308
Bitches should
help themselves.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.477
I worked for
everything I got.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.812
You can be
truly appalling.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.782
Well, something the ladies
and I agreed on tonight

01:56.784 --> 01:59.251
is that once in a while, our
husbands should make dinner.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.652
But that...

02:00.654 --> 02:01.653
that's mad!

02:01.655 --> 02:03.455
Well, we're trying
it tonight.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.523
(laughs)

02:04.525 --> 02:06.091
Cleveland's gotta make dinner!

02:06.093 --> 02:07.459
Gotta preheat the oven!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.461
Stir fry vegetables!

02:09.463 --> 02:12.531
Drink a whole bottle of wine
when he thinks no one's looking!

02:12.533 --> 02:15.701
I have to make dinner
for everyone?! No way!

02:15.703 --> 02:19.671
We're going to a mediocre
Italian chain restaurant!

02:19.673 --> 02:22.040
(laughing)

02:22.042 --> 02:24.042
CLEVELAND:
<i>Here, they treat you</i>
<i>like family.</i>

02:24.044 --> 02:28.680
<i>Which is why I was surprised</i>
<i>when they gave me a bill.</i>

02:28.682 --> 02:30.449
Mm-hmm.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.451
Could I get
more salty salad?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.519
Sure.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.255
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:41.094 --> 02:42.661
All right, you got me.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.863
I'm reading
<i>Farts</i> magazine.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.298
For the farticles.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.867
And the fartoons.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.636
Good night.
Um, no.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.037
I'm still reading.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.840
Donna, I gotta be at work
in 12 hours.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.976
You think you get to decide our
bedtime because you're the man?

02:57.978 --> 03:01.313
CLEVELAND:
<i>The correct answer is probably</i>
<i>"yes."</i>

03:01.315 --> 03:02.681
Yes?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.483
What? I don't think so!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.118
CLEVELAND:
<i>Oh-for-twelve on the day.</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:07.519
<i>I'm no good at this.</i>

03:07.521 --> 03:08.820
This is exactly
what we were talking

03:08.822 --> 03:10.088
about at my
women's group.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.857
The girls all agree
that you can't make

03:11.859 --> 03:13.358
all the decisions without me.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.459
Oh, do they? Huh?

03:14.461 --> 03:16.962
Do the girls all agree on that?
Really? Do they?

03:16.964 --> 03:19.298
Things are going to
change around here.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.535
Now, Nicole Richie wrote this
novel, and I intend to read it.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.307
Don't tell me
to go fish, Larry.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.309
I can see you have
a two right there.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.378
You're not a leopard,
you're a damn cheetah!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.680
(giggles)

03:34.682 --> 03:36.281
Junior, I need you
to watch Rallo.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.483
I'm on my way to another
woman's group meeting,

03:38.485 --> 03:40.452
and it's my turn to pick up
the pints of ice cream

03:40.454 --> 03:43.522
we won't be able to believe
we each ate a whole one of.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.492
Oh, cool!
What's this?

03:47.494 --> 03:50.529
Hey! Stay out of my
disaster preparedness kit!

03:51.864 --> 03:54.866
(laughing)

03:54.868 --> 03:56.468
Look at me, I'm Wall-E!

03:56.470 --> 04:00.005
I go on and on, no matter
how much you wish I would end!

04:00.007 --> 04:01.873
(laughing)

04:01.875 --> 04:03.375
That's it.

04:05.511 --> 04:06.878
Wait!
What are you doing?!

04:06.880 --> 04:08.880
I'm putting you
in Larry's Baby Bjorn.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
It always settles him down.
Put me down!

04:10.618 --> 04:12.084
Shh, shh.
What is this thing?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.919
It's called a joey.
I ain't no kangaroo baby.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.188
Come on, man...

04:16.856 --> 04:17.923
(snores)

04:17.925 --> 04:19.858
There we go, little guy.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.327
Boing! Boing! Boing!

04:24.664 --> 04:25.864
(slight groan)

04:25.866 --> 04:26.865
What happened to
the 'bow, bro?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.200
Donna hit me.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.835
With a list of chores!

04:29.837 --> 04:32.137
It's all because
this guy's wife

04:32.139 --> 04:35.107
told Donna I need to help
around the house more.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.110
She even made me drive
three-quarters of a mile

04:38.112 --> 04:40.612
to return our DVDs
to Blockbuster!

04:40.614 --> 04:42.347
Couldn't you just wait till
they go out of business?

04:42.349 --> 04:44.816
Thank you.
But she said no.

04:44.818 --> 04:48.854
Yeah, well Donna told Arianna I
should know to be more romantic.

04:48.856 --> 04:52.858
So I text her, "Hey, Goldilocks,
I got something for you

04:52.860 --> 04:57.296
that's not too hard and not
too soft, it's just right,"

04:57.298 --> 04:59.264
and she says that
that's not romance.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.467
Well, both your hens told Kendra
I should appreciate her more.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.469
You try telling
a six-hundred pound woman

05:04.471 --> 05:06.305
she doesn't look fat in jeans.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.274
It's literally impossible
without sounding sarcastic.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.876
You see what's going on?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.878
When our wives go to
that women's group,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.479
there're no men
around to shoot down

05:14.481 --> 05:16.448
their legitimate grievances!

05:16.450 --> 05:19.851
If only we had someone who
could infiltrate their group

05:19.853 --> 05:21.920
and convince them to
get off our backs.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.488
But it's a women's group.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.090
And we don't know any women.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.491
Nope.
Negatory.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.693
Well, that's the
end of that story.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.094
(all sigh)

05:29.096 --> 05:30.696
(TV news theme playing)

05:30.698 --> 05:32.297
Hi, I'm Dwayne Meighan.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.465
News Flash!

05:33.467 --> 05:36.501
There had had been a protests
in the street of

05:36.503 --> 05:41.106
a Middle East country called
foreign land as seen in Aladdin.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.309
Women had burqa for
the sheet over their face

05:44.311 --> 05:48.280
look like ghost but you can
see eyes peek-a-boo...

05:48.282 --> 05:49.348
Sweet! That's it!

05:49.350 --> 05:50.482
Hmm...

05:50.484 --> 05:52.317
So he starts reading me
this "farticle"--

05:52.319 --> 05:54.486
it's sort of like an
article about farts--

05:54.488 --> 05:56.655
$4.99 an issue,
by the way,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.490
yet refuses to get
a subscription!

05:58.492 --> 06:00.525
(doorbell rings)

06:02.462 --> 06:04.463
Can I help you?

06:04.465 --> 06:07.866
(falsetto, accented voice):
My name is Fatima,
thank you very much.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.868
I come looking for
your women's group

06:09.870 --> 06:11.870
because I am
in need of help.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.873
Thank you very much.

06:14.875 --> 06:19.544
(sotto voce):
It's really me.
Cleveland. Shh!

06:25.518 --> 06:29.821
I'm just saying, if Lester
wasn't too lazy to take out

06:29.823 --> 06:32.657
the garbage, I wouldn't be
so tempted to eat out of it.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.093
This is how
you help women?

06:35.095 --> 06:38.463
You sit around and drink wine
and complain about husbands?

06:38.465 --> 06:40.465
Mm-hmm.
Oh, that reminds me.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.467
Cleveland never puts
down the toilet seat.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.870
I must've fallen in
six times yesterday.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.672
Couldn't you just put
the seat down yourself?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.508
(laughs)

06:49.510 --> 06:50.642
You're funny, Fatima.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.943
(laughing)

06:51.945 --> 06:53.478
Women aren't funny.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.680
You all have it so easy.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.683
Fatima's husband drag
her here from Yemen

06:58.685 --> 07:01.853
so he could become pushy
electronics salesman,

07:01.855 --> 07:04.523
but then had affair
with LeAnn Rimes.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.491
So did Lester!

07:06.493 --> 07:09.861
Then he go back to Yemen
with my children.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.098
He say, "Me no wanty Fatima."

07:13.100 --> 07:16.868
Now I all alone,
stranded in U.S.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.137
So your husband is slob?

07:19.139 --> 07:20.672
Boo hoo!

07:20.674 --> 07:23.308
You have man,
you have everything!

07:23.310 --> 07:26.511
Appreciate husband,
especially you, Donna!

07:26.513 --> 07:28.346
You're right.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.282
We are so lucky.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.084
Oh, Fatima.
I'm so ashamed.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.286
Should be.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.654
Cleveland's not so bad.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.656
I'm sure he wonderful.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.292
Would love meet
him sometime.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.660
How about dinner
tomorrow night?

07:41.662 --> 07:42.828
I'd love to!

07:42.830 --> 07:43.862
(whistling)

07:43.864 --> 07:45.130
(doorbell rings)

07:45.132 --> 07:47.466
DONNA:
Cleveland, can you get that?

07:47.468 --> 07:50.635
(normal voice):
I did not think this through.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.871
You're gonna love Cleveland.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.506
He's no Old Spice Guy,

07:54.508 --> 07:57.142
but keep in mind I was
41 with two kids.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.878
I think stability is sexy.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.880
You can talk
yourself into it.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.281
Where is he?

08:03.283 --> 08:04.449
Cleveland!

08:04.451 --> 08:06.451
Donna, may I
use the restroom?

08:06.453 --> 08:07.853
Sure, it's that way.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.655
(Roberta screams)

08:10.657 --> 08:11.957
ROBERTA:
A black ghost!

08:11.959 --> 08:13.492
Ghosts are white!

08:13.494 --> 08:14.493
All right!

08:14.495 --> 08:16.495
Big dinner party!
Let's eat!

08:16.497 --> 08:18.096
Cleveland!
Don't be rude.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.297
Wait for Fatima.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.465
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.701
That'll give me a chance
to check... myself...

08:22.703 --> 08:24.102
for lumps.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.975
Is bathroom to the left
or to the right?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.042
The left.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.779
CLEVELAND:
Oh! You must be Fatima.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.681
(as Fatima):
And you must be Rallo.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.450
Ha, ha. I'm kidding.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.285
You must be Cleveland.
Ha, ha.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.288
CLEVELAND:
There's that famous
Middle-Eastern sense of humor.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.457
(as Fatima):
Donna she told me
so much about you.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.293
Donna so lucky to have you.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.662
CLEVELAND:
Oh, no. I'm the lucky one.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.930
(another voice):
Telegram for Mr. Brown.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.466
CLEVELAND:
Telegram? I didn't know
they still had those.

08:54.468 --> 08:55.467
(as clerk):
They do.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.468
CLEVELAND:
Where?

08:56.470 --> 08:57.702
(as clerk):
In town.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.304
CLEVELAND:
What street?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.540
(as clerk):
Stewart Street.
It's a real street.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.475
(as Fatima):
Sounds like a real street.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.143
CLEVELAND:
Says here there's
a cable emergency.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.479
I gotta go. Nice
meeting you, Fatima!

09:07.481 --> 09:09.848
(as Fatima):
Nice meeting you,
too, Cleveland!

09:09.850 --> 09:11.449
(as clerk):
Hey, how about a tip, buddy?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.852
CLEVELAND:
Sure! Coming up!

09:13.854 --> 09:15.453
Donna, I'm sorry,
I have to go.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.289
There's a cable emergency.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.991
And do you have five dollars
to tip the telegram guy?

09:21.861 --> 09:22.861
CLEVELAND:
Here you go.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.095
(as clerk):
Two dollars?!

09:24.097 --> 09:25.897
CLEVELAND: Take it or leave it!
(door slams)

09:29.502 --> 09:31.303
What the...

09:31.305 --> 09:33.171
Where am I?
What's going on?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.973
Look who's wakies!

09:34.975 --> 09:36.875
Put me down.
I don't want to...

09:36.877 --> 09:39.144
Wow, I've never
been up this high.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.479
Paul Newman's blood in a jar?

09:41.481 --> 09:42.847
Gimme some!

09:42.849 --> 09:43.915
Whoa.

09:45.451 --> 09:46.451
(giggles)

09:46.453 --> 09:48.954
I can control you.
Like in <i>Avatar.</i>

09:48.956 --> 09:50.922
Now if I kick you
with my right leg

09:50.924 --> 09:52.624
while simultaneously
pinching your...

09:52.626 --> 09:53.692
Yeah, yeah.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.494
This isn't my first
time playing Avatar.

09:56.496 --> 10:01.399
(makes electronic noises)

10:03.302 --> 10:06.471
Now that I'm up chest high,
let's go see Big Boob June.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.673
I know she works here.
Where she at?

10:08.675 --> 10:10.875
Two o'clock.
And four o'clock.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.310
Nice.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.712
(laughing)

10:16.349 --> 10:18.850
Thank you, Cleveland.
And thanks, Fatima.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.454
Our wives now appreciate
the below-average spouses

10:22.456 --> 10:26.424
they settled for and it's all
because of you two, blink-blink.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.093
Now, if you give
me the burqa,

10:28.095 --> 10:30.595
I've still got a couple of
days to get my deposit back.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.097
Yeah. You should quit
while you're ahead.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.331
Like Sarah Palin.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.000
She fixed Alaska,
got the hell out of there.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.469
Nevah!
I may be done with Fatima,

10:37.471 --> 10:40.472
but she is not yet
done with me!
Oh, dear.

10:40.474 --> 10:44.309
She can convey a thousand
emotions, just with her eyes.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.111
Men desire her eyes.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.279
Women want to be her eyes.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.282
I've taken it this far,
and I'm not going to stop

10:51.284 --> 10:54.552
until I have Donna
at my beck and call.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.289
Donna!

10:58.291 --> 10:59.491
Yes, Cleveland?

10:59.493 --> 11:00.759
Nothing.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.162
(kids shouting playfully)

11:04.164 --> 11:05.864
WALT:
Rodney, cut it out!

11:05.866 --> 11:07.632
Cut it out!

11:07.634 --> 11:11.369
Oh, so you want
to go the other way?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.104
(screams)
(laughs)

11:13.106 --> 11:14.606
That's not what
I meant at all!

11:14.608 --> 11:15.540
I think you are

11:15.542 --> 11:18.109
willfully misinterpreting
what I said!

11:18.111 --> 11:19.911
(thunderous footsteps)

11:20.846 --> 11:24.015
Can... you... dig it?!

11:25.084 --> 11:26.718
(grunting)

11:32.458 --> 11:33.858
(kids cheering)

11:35.261 --> 11:37.796
Lock target
on punk-ass bully.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.930
(robotic voice):
Target-locked.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.032
Bidi-bidi-bidi,
bidi-bidi-bidi.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.634
Stop!

11:42.636 --> 11:43.968
Put me down!

11:43.970 --> 11:45.537
Everybody start
throwing dollars,

11:45.539 --> 11:49.040
'cause this bitch looks good
on a pole. (laughs)

11:49.042 --> 11:50.742
(all cheering)

11:54.613 --> 11:56.081
CLEVELAND (normal voice):
Thank you very much.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.482
(as Fatima):
Thank you very much.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.483
(with thick accent):
Thank you very much.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.418
(doorbell rings)
There it is.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.120
KENDRA: She's here!

12:02.122 --> 12:04.355
We have a surprise
for you, Fatima!

12:05.491 --> 12:07.592
(as FATIMA):
Such terrible noise!

12:07.594 --> 12:09.661
Are we at Nickelback concert?!

12:11.197 --> 12:13.465
Okay, what are we doing?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.767
We've been looking a long
time for a woman to help,

12:15.769 --> 12:18.169
and we realized she
was here all along

12:18.171 --> 12:19.804
right under this
dumb black sheet.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.507
We love you, Fatima.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.775
Good-bye.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.943
Good-bye?!

12:24.945 --> 12:26.111
(door closes)

12:26.113 --> 12:28.646
KENDRA: We forgive
you for 9-11!

12:28.648 --> 12:30.615
(over P.A.):
This is your captain speaking.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.251
Fatima, your friends want you
to be reunited

12:33.253 --> 12:35.954
with your children,
so sit back, relax,

12:35.956 --> 12:38.590
and enjoy this 18-hour flight
to Yemen.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.291
(normal voice):
Yemen?!

12:40.293 --> 12:41.826
(groans)

12:47.767 --> 12:50.135
CAPTAIN:
Okay, we're making
our final descent.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.805
Temperature on the ground
is a crisp 119.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.707
Wha-What's happening?!

12:55.709 --> 12:59.744
Oh, my God, I slept
for 18 hours straight?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.447
(snoring)

13:02.449 --> 13:04.182
Fatima?
What?!

13:04.184 --> 13:06.618
Ma'am, just wanted you
to know, you're minutes away

13:06.620 --> 13:07.819
from being reunited
with your children.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.921
Listen, man, you got to help me.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.456
My name is Cleveland Brown.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.957
I pretended to be an Arab woman

13:12.959 --> 13:14.859
so my wife would stop
nagging me.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.529
Because, you know,
women are annoying.

13:17.531 --> 13:21.032
My entire professional life
is devoted to helping women.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.300
So then you know.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.802
(yelling)

13:23.804 --> 13:26.237
That's no way to treat a lady!

13:29.708 --> 13:32.844
Yem-in big trouble now!

13:39.018 --> 13:41.019
All right, Cleveland,
just find a McDonald's,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.288
and they'll know how
to get you home.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.322
Hubba-hubba!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.623
I'd stone that!

13:45.625 --> 13:49.160
I am so jihad
right now!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.496
A girl could get used to this.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.797
Don't stray
from the group!

13:52.799 --> 13:55.333
Come, our husband
is expecting us!

13:55.335 --> 13:56.467
Our husband?

13:56.469 --> 13:59.270
You best not be talking
'bout my man!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.854
(as Fatima): Just gonna take
a little disco nap.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.155
But don't worry,
I'll rally.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.156
No rest!

14:18.158 --> 14:20.091
There is so much
work to do!

14:20.093 --> 14:21.526
Why do I have to work?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.095
I'm the wife of a
very rich man.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.830
(sotto voce):
Do we know how rich, by the way?

14:25.832 --> 14:28.600
Get to work!

14:28.602 --> 14:32.637
I wish I could make
this work go away. (sighs)

14:32.639 --> 14:41.079
♪ Oh-oh, oh... oh, oh...

14:45.851 --> 14:49.320

15:20.987 --> 15:21.920
Junior?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.655
Hi.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.090
(kids shouting playfully)

15:26.092 --> 15:28.493
Look around, Rallo.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.661
<i>You</i> did this.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.196
You restored peace
to the playground.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.499
The children
of Stoolbend
have erected

15:34.501 --> 15:36.434
this monument
in your honor.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.903
It-It's beautiful.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.005
(foot stomping)

15:41.007 --> 15:42.807
(kids screaming)

15:42.809 --> 15:45.043
(feet stomping)

15:47.980 --> 15:50.915
Looks like you're not the only
one who has a socially awkward,

15:50.917 --> 15:53.985
pre-diabetic older brother
with a baby carrier.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.653
Junior...?

15:55.655 --> 15:57.855
(snoring)

15:57.857 --> 15:59.257
(both laugh)

15:59.259 --> 16:02.360
Initiate attack
protocol 28 bravo.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.764
(yells, gasps)

16:07.700 --> 16:12.170
(mimics robotic whirring)

16:14.974 --> 16:18.309
You're gonna wish
you were never Bjorn.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.544
Battle mode!

16:28.020 --> 16:29.554
Hmm.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.668
(kids screaming)

16:43.670 --> 16:45.036
(gasps)

16:45.038 --> 16:47.772
(both grunting)

16:48.974 --> 16:50.675
Whoa!

16:50.677 --> 16:52.577
(boy screaming)

16:58.784 --> 17:00.985
Want to play some kickball?

17:00.987 --> 17:03.654
(groaning)

17:03.656 --> 17:06.524
I'd rather play handball.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.393
(groans)

17:14.133 --> 17:16.000
(grunting)

17:19.271 --> 17:22.206
(all yelling)

17:27.446 --> 17:28.646
(clanking)

17:28.648 --> 17:31.349
(groans) Junior?

17:31.351 --> 17:32.650
Junior?

17:32.652 --> 17:33.951
(robotic whirring)

17:33.953 --> 17:35.019
Malfunction!

17:35.021 --> 17:37.588
Gyroscopic sensors at 20%.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.158
Vrr! Vrr! System failure.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.361
Backup generator unresponsive.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.631
You know, in all
the excitement,

17:46.633 --> 17:48.199
I think I kind of forgot

17:48.201 --> 17:50.101
that my stepbrother's
a little Gumpy.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.602
Yeah, mine, too.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.937
But why is yours smoking?

17:52.939 --> 17:55.506
(hissing)

17:55.508 --> 17:57.341
He's not on a healthy diet.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.310
Rallo Tubbs, by the way.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.612
Rodney King.
No relation.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.513
No relation to who?

18:02.515 --> 18:03.514
I don't know.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.650
My mama just told me
to always say that.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.651
I like you, Rodney.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.586
I want you to be
my new friend.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.854
Walt, you're out.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.122
(gulps)

18:11.124 --> 18:12.490
Come on, Rodney.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.593
You gotta see this lady June
at the grocery store.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.928
Oh, you mean
Big Boob June?

18:16.930 --> 18:17.929
My man!

18:17.931 --> 18:19.697
(Rodney chuckles)

18:24.670 --> 18:26.504
(toilet flushes)

18:26.506 --> 18:29.507
(sotto voce):
Hmm, he didn't even lower
the seat.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.276
Haven't even worn
the jacket I bought you.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.511
(as Fatima):
Maybe you could wear it

18:33.513 --> 18:35.646
when you take me out
to dinner tonight.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.416
Nah.
Just ate a big bowl of cereal.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.285
Oh, wha?!
You know how hard it is

18:41.287 --> 18:43.788
to get reservation at
Thank Allah It's Friday's?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.623
Wasn't listening, don't care.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.191
Dance for me!

18:47.193 --> 18:49.660
Dance like Bill Cosby
in opening credits!

18:49.662 --> 18:52.797
(humming show theme)

18:52.799 --> 18:54.031
Yes, good!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.299
More mugging.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.501
Take more credit.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.703
Now pass judgment
on own race.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.339
No! No more dance!

19:01.341 --> 19:03.141
(normal voice):
Because I am a man.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.476
What? Really?

19:05.478 --> 19:09.013
But your hands are so feminine,
and your hips are so wide.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.616
Ooh, you smooth.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.651
But you listen to me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.520
Me and my sister-wives
have been working

19:15.522 --> 19:17.255
our fingers
to the bone for you!

19:17.257 --> 19:20.491
And you have the nerve
to ask me to dance?!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.860
Well, mister,
I don't have the energy.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.463
Oh, my God, that's what Donna
says when I try

19:25.465 --> 19:27.265
to honk 'em while
she's washing dishes.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.501
To think, it took
being a wife

19:30.503 --> 19:31.601
to a husband like you

19:31.603 --> 19:35.606
to learn how to be a husband
to a wife like me.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.809
You know, you made me realize
something very important.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.811
I should probably
do a dude check

19:40.813 --> 19:42.246
on the rest
of my wives.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.314
Dude check!

19:43.316 --> 19:44.582
(male voice):
Uh-oh.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.146
Must be so, so tough
with Cleveland gone,

20:15.148 --> 20:18.149
but, uh, you know,
maybe letting go

20:18.151 --> 20:20.518
is opening yourself up
to something new.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.620
(panting)
Cleveland!

20:22.622 --> 20:24.255
Oh, he's alive.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.823
Uh, yay!

20:25.825 --> 20:28.092
Uh, well, uh, I should go.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.594
I'll, uh, see you
around, Cleveland.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.262
Uh, happy you're back.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.665
I, uh... Yeah.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.001
Cleveland, where
have you been?

20:37.003 --> 20:39.870
It's not where I've been,
it's what I've been.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.606
A terrible husband.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.775
And I haven't appreciated you
and the hard work you do--

20:44.777 --> 20:46.777
you're a mother,
you're a maid,

20:46.779 --> 20:48.913
you're a cook,
you're a lover.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.948
You are my queen
and sometimes I forget

20:50.950 --> 20:53.684
that I'm here
to serve you.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.419
Oh, Cleveland,
that's sweet.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.822
Well, you're just in time
to help me with dinner.
No.
