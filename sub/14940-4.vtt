Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:02.292 --> 00:03.693
You're Alpha secret agents.

00:03.760 --> 00:05.361
You want me on your team.
I'm awesome.

00:05.429 --> 00:07.124
- What's all this?
- Dr. Rosen said

00:07.192 --> 00:08.514
that I should find
a way to scream

00:08.582 --> 00:10.151
without terrifying you,
so I did.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.519
I'm moving out. I'm gonna go
and live at my office.

00:12.586 --> 00:14.833
Do you like Italian?

00:14.900 --> 00:16.464
Rachel, if we're gonna be
working together--

00:16.532 --> 00:18.534
Right.
Forget I mentioned it.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.465
Nina, your life
is out of control.

00:20.533 --> 00:24.575
No pushing
unless absolutely necessary.

00:24.642 --> 00:26.511
I'm done.

00:26.578 --> 00:27.479
- You're what?
- I'm done.

00:35.361 --> 00:37.762
Why don't you
get the hell out?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.231
That's what
you always wanted.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.369
Believe me,
nothing would make me happier!

00:41.437 --> 00:42.971
You never wanted
to be here!

00:43.038 --> 00:46.508
Is that the best you can do--
run away?

00:46.575 --> 00:49.710
Go ahead.
Get the hell out.

00:49.778 --> 00:52.514
Abandon your family.

00:52.582 --> 00:54.649
We don't want you anyway.

00:54.717 --> 00:56.250
No, no!
Daddy, please don't go!

00:56.318 --> 00:58.686
Nina, sweetie,
I'm sorry.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.287
I'll call you soon.
I promise.

01:00.355 --> 01:03.290
- No, you can't leave.
- Sweetie.

01:03.358 --> 01:05.861
You can't leave.

01:05.928 --> 01:10.068
- I can't leave.
- Mm-mm.

01:11.838 --> 01:12.972
I can't leave.

01:15.243 --> 01:19.213
Thank you, Daddy.

01:21.485 --> 01:23.786
Hey, this trip down
memory lane is killing my buzz.

01:23.854 --> 01:27.858
Let's go have some fun.

01:27.926 --> 01:29.593
Let's go, babe.

01:29.661 --> 01:31.362
Come on.

01:31.430 --> 01:32.797
Let's go!

02:00.095 --> 02:02.297
I'm bringing her back

John said
he didn't want to have dinner

02:58.123 --> 02:59.756
because we work together,
but when he said it,

02:59.824 --> 03:01.959
his heart rate went up,
and his pupils dilated.

03:02.026 --> 03:05.162
Wait, you lie-detected the guy
with your ability

03:05.230 --> 03:06.731
just because
he turned you down for a date?

03:06.799 --> 03:08.166
- Maybe. Yes.
- Rachel--

03:08.234 --> 03:09.768
- Don't judge me.
- Rachel, you can't do that.

03:09.835 --> 03:11.036
I'm a freak.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.337
- Yeah.
- It's 'cause of my ability,

03:12.405 --> 03:13.605
right?
No.

03:13.673 --> 03:15.708
You are a freak
for a million different reasons.

03:17.844 --> 03:19.245
What?
We have rules, right?

03:19.312 --> 03:20.513
No cursing me out
in foreign languages.

03:20.581 --> 03:21.848
I didn't agree to any--

03:21.916 --> 03:23.349
Don't look at me.
I'm not ready yet.

03:23.417 --> 03:24.517
Gary?

03:24.585 --> 03:25.886
Gary, what the hell
are you doing?

03:25.953 --> 03:27.721
Gary!
- What the hell are you doing?

03:27.789 --> 03:29.056
- Gary?
- Don't--no. Guys, hold on.

03:29.124 --> 03:30.457
Gary, why aren't you dressed?

03:30.525 --> 03:32.760
Yeah, I know.
I should be dressed by now.

03:32.828 --> 03:34.829
But the alarm clock
didn't go off.

03:34.897 --> 03:35.930
This is a cheap alarm clock.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.833
I'm supposed to get up at 7:42.

03:37.901 --> 03:40.636
I call my mom at 8:00,
then I have my breakfast.

03:40.704 --> 03:41.837
It didn't happen.

03:41.905 --> 03:43.239
Bill, it's 9:03.
- Gary.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.408
- This is chaos.
- Gary, why are you taking

03:45.476 --> 03:47.444
a shower in the office?

03:47.512 --> 03:49.747
Oh, Dr. Rosen said
that I could stay here

03:49.814 --> 03:53.184
till I find an apartment.
But-is that my blanket?

03:53.252 --> 03:54.886
- Yeah.
- There's hair and skin

03:54.954 --> 03:56.354
on my blanket.

03:56.422 --> 03:59.758
Gary, were you naked
on my blanket?

03:59.826 --> 04:01.660
Yeah, because
this gets sticky.

04:01.728 --> 04:03.362
This is all sticky on my skin.

04:03.430 --> 04:05.564
And Dr. Rosen said that I should
make myself comfortable.

04:05.632 --> 04:08.201
Come on, guys, get out.
This is inappropriate.

04:08.269 --> 04:10.337
You're right--this is
definitely inappropriate.

04:10.404 --> 04:11.738
I'm gonna have to take off
my towel.

04:11.806 --> 04:13.306
- No, no, don't, Gary--
- And you're gonna see my fruit.

04:13.374 --> 04:14.841
- No!
- His fruit.

04:14.909 --> 04:16.343
Yeah, I call it my fruit.

04:16.411 --> 04:18.812
- Gary--
- Uh, morning.

04:20.415 --> 04:23.450
Hey.
Casual mondays?

04:23.518 --> 04:24.718
No, I took a shower.
Get out.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.086
- Excuse me.
- Unless, of course,

04:26.154 --> 04:29.289
you want to see his fruit.
No, no, I'll pass.

04:29.357 --> 04:31.658
I got to talk
to Dr. Rosen, so...

04:31.725 --> 04:33.393
Welcome to the party, son.

04:33.460 --> 04:36.163
Rosen's in with Kat.
What's up?

04:40.067 --> 04:41.601
And bolt.

04:43.871 --> 04:46.272
Bolt.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.308
Data port.

04:48.376 --> 04:51.311
Data port. Done.

04:51.379 --> 04:53.580
Two carburetors
in less than a minute--

04:53.648 --> 04:54.681
very impressive.

04:54.749 --> 04:56.917
Yep, I watched the video.

04:56.985 --> 04:59.487
Yeah, once...
Yesterday.

04:59.555 --> 05:04.525
Your neurons must myelinate
at an astounding rate.

05:04.593 --> 05:06.728
Oh, sorry. It's commonly
called muscle memory.

05:06.795 --> 05:08.296
Ah.

05:08.364 --> 05:10.598
Which might explain why you
can almost instantly acquire

05:10.666 --> 05:13.534
complex physical skills
that normally would take

05:13.602 --> 05:15.336
years to master.

05:15.404 --> 05:17.472
Yeah, well, all I know
is I can do a bunch of stuff,

05:17.540 --> 05:19.140
but I just can't remember
how I learned it.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.509
Yes, that does seem to be
the tradeoff, doesn't it?

05:21.576 --> 05:25.847
Rapid learning at the cost
of long-term memory.

05:25.914 --> 05:28.115
What's most intriguing
is how you retain

05:28.183 --> 05:30.384
the skills
in your muscle memory

05:30.452 --> 05:31.819
even if the experience
of learning

05:31.887 --> 05:35.056
is completely forgotten.

05:35.124 --> 05:37.158
So...

05:37.226 --> 05:40.729
basic electronics,
various martial arts, violin,

05:40.797 --> 05:43.332
and now you can add
motorcycle mechanic to the list.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.867
So...

05:44.935 --> 05:46.970
when do I get to do
the cool stuff--

05:47.037 --> 05:49.272
you know, like track a perp,
shoot a gun,

05:49.339 --> 05:50.907
rappel out of a helicopter?

05:50.974 --> 05:52.275
Well, fortunately,
none of us

05:52.342 --> 05:53.576
have had to jump
out of a helicopter yet.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.644
Come on, Doc.

05:55.712 --> 05:57.713
I got, like,
six weeks of memory, max.

05:57.781 --> 05:59.649
So, technically,
I've spent a third of my life

05:59.716 --> 06:00.783
auditioning for you.

06:00.851 --> 06:03.152
Kat, you're not auditioning.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.187
I'm trying to help you.

06:05.255 --> 06:06.389
It's my hope
we can find a way

06:06.456 --> 06:08.958
of counteracting
your memory loss.

06:09.025 --> 06:11.060
Counteract it?
Why would I want to do that?

06:11.128 --> 06:13.195
I like it the way it is--
no rearview mirror.

06:13.263 --> 06:15.030
Well, wouldn't you like
to at least know

06:15.098 --> 06:16.966
what your favorite song is?
Or was?

06:17.033 --> 06:20.236
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

06:20.304 --> 06:22.471
Almost every one of these albums
takes me back

06:22.539 --> 06:24.006
to a specific moment
in my life,

06:24.074 --> 06:25.308
so, whenever I play one,

06:25.376 --> 06:28.311
I'm flooded
with all sorts of memories.

06:28.379 --> 06:30.781
I guess you could say I'm
reliving my personal history.

06:32.451 --> 06:33.885
Excuse me, Dr. Rosen.

06:33.952 --> 06:37.956
Um, we got another one
for you.

06:38.024 --> 06:39.624
Uh, I'll be right there, John.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.160
Thanks.

06:42.228 --> 06:44.362
All right, so, Kat,
I want you to have this.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.898
This takes video.
Really?

06:46.966 --> 06:49.301
What do you want me
to record?

06:49.369 --> 06:50.903
Whatever you want.

06:50.971 --> 06:52.438
Start collecting
your memories.

06:52.505 --> 06:54.707
We'll talk about this more
at our next session.

06:54.774 --> 06:57.743
Okay.

06:57.811 --> 06:59.678
- Robert Lewis...
- Mm-hmm.

06:59.746 --> 07:03.315
Branch manager of the Liberty
Citizen Bank over on 43rd...

07:03.383 --> 07:05.350
He tried to steal 500 grand
from his own bank.

07:05.418 --> 07:07.853
Claimed he was saving a baby.

07:07.921 --> 07:10.189
We got him
in the MRI room now.

07:11.525 --> 07:13.292
Same symptoms
as all the others--

07:13.360 --> 07:16.095
hallucination and confusion.

07:16.163 --> 07:18.331
Two jewelry stores,
that state trooper,

07:18.398 --> 07:20.666
and now a bank,
all within 72 hours.

07:20.734 --> 07:24.003
It's got to be
an Alpha, right?

07:24.070 --> 07:25.237
What are you saying?

07:25.305 --> 07:27.039
You saying
Nina pushed this guy?

07:27.107 --> 07:29.441
I'm just saying
that Mr. Lewis' MRI results

07:29.509 --> 07:31.477
are consistent
with her ability.

07:31.545 --> 07:33.045
The robbery
took over an hour.

07:33.113 --> 07:35.080
Nina's ability
doesn't last that long.

07:35.148 --> 07:37.516
Unless she's increased
the intensity and duration

07:37.584 --> 07:39.518
of her inductions,
which she could do.

07:39.586 --> 07:41.286
Yeah, when we were together,

07:41.354 --> 07:45.491
near the end,
she pushed me once.

07:45.558 --> 07:47.826
Now, I lost half a day.

07:47.894 --> 07:49.361
She said it was an accident.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.129
For her own safety,
we need to bring her in.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.265
"For her own safety"?

07:53.332 --> 07:55.233
Rachel,
the government fears Nina.

07:55.301 --> 07:57.469
They always have.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.037
And if and when
they find out about this,

07:59.104 --> 08:00.671
guilty or not,
she'll be a suspect.

08:00.739 --> 08:02.072
And I think we all know
what the government

08:02.140 --> 08:04.508
does to Alphas
when they get scared.

08:04.576 --> 08:07.111
Does Cley know?
Not yet.

08:07.179 --> 08:08.880
And I'm gonna do my best
to keep it off his radar

08:08.947 --> 08:11.282
for another day or two.
So how do we even find her?

08:11.350 --> 08:15.119
Gary said her phone's
been dead for over a week.

08:15.187 --> 08:17.489
Well, will you work
with Gary, then?

08:17.556 --> 08:20.525
And see if you can compile
a list of the places

08:20.593 --> 08:22.694
that she frequents and then
go over them one by one.

08:22.762 --> 08:24.763
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get on that.

08:31.271 --> 08:33.405
Doc, maybe you want to let
Bill take point on this, okay?

08:33.474 --> 08:35.073
I don't think Nina's
gonna want to see me.

08:35.142 --> 08:37.477
Despite what you believe,
Cameron, she trusts you.

08:37.544 --> 08:40.279
What if she doesn't want
to come in?

08:40.347 --> 08:41.981
I think we both know

08:42.049 --> 08:45.552
Nina doesn't do anything
she doesn't want to do.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.821
Bring her in,
whatever it takes.

08:54.681 --> 08:56.815
John.

08:56.883 --> 09:00.184
Look...

09:00.252 --> 09:02.219
I'm smart
and kind of cute.

09:02.287 --> 09:04.989
I'm nice.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.991
And if you don't want to go out
with me, I totally get it,

09:08.059 --> 09:11.327
but at least have the decency
to give me the real reason.

09:14.063 --> 09:15.997
We work together,
like I said.

09:21.935 --> 09:24.003
Yeah, you see,
your heart rate is up,

09:24.071 --> 09:26.104
and you're sweating.

09:26.172 --> 09:29.407
It was a lie then,
and it's a lie now, so...

09:34.812 --> 09:36.379
It's not you.

09:36.447 --> 09:38.347
Really?
That's all you got?

09:40.450 --> 09:42.651
Enjoy your eggs.

09:42.719 --> 09:46.021
Rachel, wait.

09:46.088 --> 09:47.922
Okay, I'm waiting.

09:49.925 --> 09:51.492
I don't talk about this...

09:51.560 --> 09:54.461
ever.

09:54.529 --> 09:57.464
Two years ago, I was deployed
in Kandahar province.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.066
Our convoy--
it was hit by an I.E.D.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.601
My Stryker caught on fire.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.838
I got out,
but not fast enough.

10:06.906 --> 10:10.208
It covers about 35% of my body.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.710
Oh, God.

10:13.778 --> 10:15.612
- Wow.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. I--

10:15.680 --> 10:16.846
No, it...

10:16.914 --> 10:18.581
- No, John.
- No, no, it's okay.

10:18.649 --> 10:21.383
I think I'll go out
for breakfast.

10:25.721 --> 10:27.822
Are you okay?

10:27.889 --> 10:29.856
Come on,
let's go find Nina.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.206
It's the next place
on the list.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.708
Why can't Nina
ever go anyplace quiet?

10:51.776 --> 10:53.243
Nina dragged me here
a couple times,

10:53.310 --> 10:54.744
but it was never crazy
like this.

10:54.811 --> 10:57.913
You don't even want to know
what I'm smelling.

11:02.585 --> 11:05.553
Clive Christian perfume--
it might be Nina.

11:05.621 --> 11:06.788
All right, let's split up
and look around.

11:06.855 --> 11:09.456
Hey, hey, you find her,
you come get me, okay?

11:09.524 --> 11:10.791
- Okay.
- All right.

11:10.859 --> 11:13.093
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, excuse me.

11:16.230 --> 11:21.300
♪ ♪

11:21.368 --> 11:24.136
Nina.

11:24.204 --> 11:25.137
Hey, Rache.

11:25.205 --> 11:26.305
Hello, beautiful.

11:26.372 --> 11:29.375
You lost?
No, I'm not.

11:31.078 --> 11:32.912
What are you doing here?

11:32.980 --> 11:34.747
Dr. Rosen needs to see you,
Nina--come on, let's go.

11:34.814 --> 11:36.015
Yeah, well,
I don't want to see him.

11:36.082 --> 11:37.549
- Nina--
- and if you know

11:37.617 --> 11:40.252
what's good for you, Rachel,
you'd leave before you get hurt.

11:40.319 --> 11:41.886
Rachel--
you're that senses girl, right?

11:41.954 --> 11:45.123
Cool.
How do you know who I am?

11:45.190 --> 11:47.325
Nina, who is this guy?

11:47.392 --> 11:49.260
Is it true
you can actually get off

11:49.328 --> 11:50.561
by someone kissing you?

11:53.532 --> 11:54.966
You told him that?

11:55.034 --> 11:56.702
No, relax.
No judgment here.

11:56.769 --> 11:57.969
Nothing to be ashamed of.

11:58.037 --> 11:59.938
You know, he's right.

12:00.006 --> 12:02.574
You need to learn
how to enjoy what you can do,

12:02.642 --> 12:04.443
what makes you special.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.779
In fact...

12:06.846 --> 12:09.948
You want to kiss me...

12:10.016 --> 12:14.320
Right...now.

12:14.387 --> 12:16.422
Yeah, I do.

12:23.497 --> 12:24.431
Oh.

12:29.203 --> 12:31.138
Nina, what the hell
are you doing?

12:31.206 --> 12:33.908
Rachel, don't--hey!

12:33.976 --> 12:35.577
I'm just helping Rachel
have some fun.

12:35.644 --> 12:37.345
- Just let the girls enjoy-
- Shut up.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.084
Rachel!

12:42.152 --> 12:43.386
Nina, stop.

12:43.453 --> 12:46.623
That's nice, Rachel.
You can stop now.

12:46.690 --> 12:48.691
Hicks.

12:48.759 --> 12:50.926
Let him go.
You know I don't need to ask.

12:52.729 --> 12:54.063
- Hoo. Hoo. Whoo.
- Ooh!

12:54.130 --> 12:57.600
Sorry, honey.
Oh, Hicks, right?

12:57.667 --> 12:58.935
Nina told me all about you.

12:59.002 --> 13:00.336
She's right.
You are uptight.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.438
But, hey, I used to be
the same way,

13:02.506 --> 13:06.810
and now life is good,
and I'm just enjoying the ride.

13:06.878 --> 13:08.913
So it was you that tried
to rob the bank, huh?

13:08.980 --> 13:11.115
Girl needs
a little pocket money.

13:11.183 --> 13:13.050
No, this isn't you, Nina.

13:13.118 --> 13:15.653
You know me so well, right?

13:15.720 --> 13:19.624
Hicks, you have no idea.
You never did.

13:19.692 --> 13:23.295
With Tommy,
I don't have to pretend.

13:23.362 --> 13:25.664
He makes me happy.

13:25.731 --> 13:27.966
- What did you do to me?
- Hey.

13:28.034 --> 13:29.301
I did warn you, Rachel.

13:29.368 --> 13:31.202
Look, we're here
to help you.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.370
She doesn't need your help.

13:38.478 --> 13:41.246
No, Hicks.
Hicks! Put me down!

13:41.314 --> 13:44.884
Okay, she's getting away.
Hicks!

13:44.951 --> 13:46.952
Hicks, put me down.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.421
Come on, let me down.
We gotta go!

13:49.489 --> 13:51.356
Hicks, snap out of it!

13:55.162 --> 13:56.662
Wait.
W-where'd she go?

13:56.730 --> 13:58.531
She's gone.

14:12.469 --> 14:13.670
A little reality.

14:13.737 --> 14:15.605
All right, what did you give me
this time, Doc?

14:15.673 --> 14:18.174
Risperidone.
It helps ameliorate the effects

14:18.242 --> 14:19.842
of an induction.

14:19.910 --> 14:22.578
Oh, this is
just as I feared.

14:22.646 --> 14:24.713
Her ability
has grown significantly,

14:24.781 --> 14:28.650
so her pushes are gonna last
that much longer.

14:28.718 --> 14:31.520
Are you all right?

14:31.588 --> 14:33.955
I'm great.

14:34.023 --> 14:37.625
Rachel, would you ask Gary
to join us, please?

14:37.693 --> 14:40.361
I still cannot believe
that Nina did that to Rachel.

14:40.429 --> 14:41.930
I mean, she knows
how sensitive that woman is.

14:41.997 --> 14:44.933
I mean, that's just cold.
Okay, who's the guy?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.101
Well, Nina mentioned

14:47.169 --> 14:49.504
a "Tommy" a few times
in her therapy.

14:49.572 --> 14:52.474
Now, if it's the same Tommy,
he was her first boyfriend.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.075
He was pretty important to her
at a younger age.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.944
And obviously
not a very good influence.

14:56.011 --> 14:58.914
And the "bad ex-boyfriend"
defense is no defense.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.382
There's no excuse.

15:00.449 --> 15:02.684
Listen, we, uh...

15:02.752 --> 15:05.053
we need to think of Nina
as an addict now.

15:05.121 --> 15:08.056
The more she uses her ability,
the more she needs it.

15:08.123 --> 15:09.457
The more she needs it,

15:09.525 --> 15:11.192
the more she uses it
to make herself feel better

15:11.260 --> 15:13.461
and the more powerless
she is to control it.

15:13.529 --> 15:16.731
So we have to get back out there
and find her again.

15:16.799 --> 15:19.467
Look, Cley knows we're working
on the bank robbery, okay?

15:19.535 --> 15:21.970
Look, he's already asking
for MRI results on Lewis.

15:22.037 --> 15:23.771
Well, I hope you told him
the situation's under control.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.973
I lied spectacularly,

15:26.041 --> 15:27.274
but that doesn't mean
that we have to--

15:27.342 --> 15:28.542
The clock is ticking.
All right, we get it.

15:28.610 --> 15:30.811
Hey, hey, hey.
We need to lock Nina up.

15:30.878 --> 15:33.146
Her office is my man cave,

15:33.214 --> 15:35.449
unless she starts
using another office,

15:35.517 --> 15:37.017
then she doesn't have
to go to jail.

15:37.084 --> 15:38.351
Thank you, Gary.

15:38.419 --> 15:40.353
Listen, Tommy is still
our best lead, right?

15:40.421 --> 15:41.888
So, Gary, I need you to check
all high-school yearbooks

15:41.955 --> 15:44.123
from Greenwich, Connecticut
from what, year 1990--?

15:44.191 --> 15:45.491
- '95.
- No, no, Greenwich.

15:45.559 --> 15:46.626
No.
Yeah, Greenwich, Connecticut.

15:46.693 --> 15:48.361
- Gary.
- It's North Shore, Long Island.

15:48.429 --> 15:49.796
Gary...
What are you talking about?

15:49.863 --> 15:51.097
Pull all the yearbooks
from all the high schools

15:51.164 --> 15:54.200
in Castle Hill--the Bronx.

15:54.268 --> 15:56.369
Nina tends to embellish
her past.

16:01.575 --> 16:03.075
Pushing me like that!

16:03.143 --> 16:05.344
I am not pushing!
I'm just asking for more!

16:05.412 --> 16:07.246
All you ever do
is you push and push!

16:07.314 --> 16:09.416
I'm just asking
for a little more!

16:09.483 --> 16:11.485
I can't stand it here
anymore!

16:14.222 --> 16:15.823
Sorry.
Just cutting through.

16:15.890 --> 16:18.426
Whatever.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.335
You should hear my parents
go at it--way louder.

16:27.402 --> 16:30.071
Good for you.

16:30.139 --> 16:33.108
I'm Tommy.
I just moved into 286.

16:33.175 --> 16:34.943
Nina.

16:35.010 --> 16:39.847
Cool.
Like Nina Simone?

16:39.915 --> 16:43.684
I know you're having a blast
listening to your parents fight,

16:43.751 --> 16:45.652
but you want to maybe go
for a slice?

16:47.989 --> 16:51.024
I can't. I gotta...
keep an eye out.

16:51.092 --> 16:53.160
Sometimes their fights
get a little crazy.

16:53.227 --> 16:57.565
Well, then why don't I go grab
a couple slices, bring 'em back?

16:57.632 --> 16:59.901
Yeah, sure.
A slice sounds good.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.077
Nina Simone.

17:10.145 --> 17:13.948
Hot chocolate, extra whip,
little bit of cinnamon--

17:14.016 --> 17:15.983
just the way you like it.

17:16.050 --> 17:18.452
What's wrong?

17:18.520 --> 17:20.387
Nothing. I'm fine.

17:20.454 --> 17:23.156
Don't let what happened
at the club rattle you.

17:23.223 --> 17:26.226
Trust me,
everything's gonna be okay.

17:26.294 --> 17:27.560
I know.

17:27.628 --> 17:31.332
You're not very convincing.

17:31.399 --> 17:34.268
I just--
I think I screwed up.

17:34.336 --> 17:37.839
Hey, I love you.

17:37.907 --> 17:40.275
You know that, right?

17:40.343 --> 17:42.478
I love you too.

17:49.386 --> 17:53.689
I don't know where Tommy is,
and I don't want to.

17:53.757 --> 17:56.759
He never cared about us.
He wasn't happy.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.360
He wanted to go,
so I let him go.

17:58.428 --> 18:01.730
And Lucas and I--
we are better off without him.

18:01.798 --> 18:03.098
Is there anyone else
you'd think he'd contact--

18:03.165 --> 18:05.600
family, friends?
- He's gone.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.069
That's all I care about.
We are better off without him.

18:08.137 --> 18:10.438
- Okay, we get it.
- If you think of anything else,

18:10.506 --> 18:13.941
here's my card.
Give me a call.

18:14.009 --> 18:17.945
"Department of Defense."
Whatever.

18:22.551 --> 18:24.285
Put it back, kid.

18:24.352 --> 18:26.921
Come on,
you can't be cool?

18:26.989 --> 18:28.723
It's just a beer.

18:28.791 --> 18:31.826
Get out
before I call the cops.

18:31.894 --> 18:36.164
Come on, Nina.
Let's go.

18:36.232 --> 18:38.634
You can sell me the beer.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.969
I'm 21.

18:45.007 --> 18:47.042
Girls have it so easy.

18:47.110 --> 18:50.445
All you got to do is smile,
and you get what you want.

18:50.513 --> 18:53.849
No, that's not it.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.284
Why else do you think
he sold it to you?

18:55.351 --> 18:58.721
I can control people--

18:58.788 --> 19:01.390
like, I don't know,
in vampire movies?

19:01.458 --> 19:04.159
"Look into my eyes."

19:04.227 --> 19:05.260
All that?

19:05.328 --> 19:07.395
Yeah.
Here, hold my beer.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.132
Hey.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.667
Stand on one foot.

19:15.670 --> 19:18.172
Jump up and down.

19:20.341 --> 19:21.608
Stop.

19:21.676 --> 19:23.677
You can go now.

19:23.745 --> 19:27.381
It only lasts
a couple of minutes.

19:27.449 --> 19:29.517
That was awesome.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.589
It's beautiful here.

19:35.657 --> 19:39.694
Pizza at sea--
classic combination.

19:39.761 --> 19:40.695
Do you have any red pepper
on board?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.364
No, sir.
I'm sorry.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.333
Oh, steward,
bring us some red pepper.

19:49.972 --> 19:51.706
That never stops being amazing.

19:55.211 --> 19:57.245
You know what we should do?

19:57.313 --> 19:59.681
This--just sail away.

20:02.051 --> 20:04.286
- Sail away where?
- Wherever.

20:04.354 --> 20:06.489
We'll sail around the world
maybe--who cares?

20:06.557 --> 20:09.125
Well, I don't know anything
about boats and neither do you.

20:09.192 --> 20:11.227
No, I do.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.896
Couple of summers I worked
at the Baywood Marina.

20:13.964 --> 20:16.766
That's where I met Becky.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.535
Oh, hey, you know what?
Just forget Becky.

20:19.603 --> 20:21.637
Let's just sail away to Bermuda
and get married.

20:24.441 --> 20:25.875
- You serious?
- Yeah.

20:25.943 --> 20:28.411
I mean, we'll--
we'll have to get a sailboat

20:28.479 --> 20:30.146
and then get it ready.

20:30.214 --> 20:31.581
But then, you know,
we'll go to Bermuda,

20:31.648 --> 20:34.784
and it'll be
a permanent honeymoon.

20:34.852 --> 20:36.152
No one
will ever bother us again.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.756
It sounds nice, but...

20:39.824 --> 20:41.625
Rosen will never
stop looking for me.

20:41.693 --> 20:45.429
You're gonna let one guy
stand between us and our dreams?

20:45.496 --> 20:46.696
You can fix this.

20:46.764 --> 20:49.065
You can fix anything.

20:52.470 --> 20:55.405
Last week we started to talk
about your father.

20:55.472 --> 20:57.206
Would you like
to continue that?

20:57.274 --> 21:01.777
Would you like me to make you
jam that pen in your eye?

21:01.845 --> 21:04.613
Nina, I'm on your side.

21:04.681 --> 21:08.584
And remember,
you came here for my help.

21:08.651 --> 21:11.687
It was either you or jail.

21:11.754 --> 21:16.125
Hey, Doc. What is going on?
What's happening?

21:16.193 --> 21:17.527
It's a little early
for our session.

21:17.594 --> 21:19.829
What is the deal, huh?

21:19.897 --> 21:21.998
I've been talking to this
stupid phone for two days now,

21:22.066 --> 21:23.699
and you are in your own world.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.934
I'm not feeling the love.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.938
Would you like to say anything
about that?

21:30.006 --> 21:33.341
I'm sorry, Kat.
I've been preoccupied.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.309
Nina, right?

21:35.377 --> 21:38.012
It's cool. Gary told me
she's been off the rez.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.347
- Gary told you what?
- Don't worry about it.

21:40.415 --> 21:44.117
I'm gonna keep it on the D.L.--
not for government ears.

21:44.185 --> 21:46.753
Yes, I'd hope
you appreciate that fact,

21:46.821 --> 21:48.922
if for no other reason
than Nina's sake.

21:48.989 --> 21:53.226
She's, um--she's a bit
troubled these days.

21:53.294 --> 21:55.461
You're the one
who looks troubled to me.

21:58.265 --> 22:01.667
Do you want to talk about it?

22:01.735 --> 22:04.770
Uh, no, thank you,
but I appreciate your concerns.

22:04.838 --> 22:08.041
That's interesting, 'cause
I have to spill my guts to you,

22:08.108 --> 22:10.944
but you get a free pass--that
doesn't seem very fair, does it?

22:11.012 --> 22:12.946
Sharing is good.

22:13.014 --> 22:14.448
I mean, that's what
you're always saying, right?

22:14.515 --> 22:17.584
- May I see that?
- Yes.

22:20.521 --> 22:23.290
Kat, the reason I'm taking it
relatively slow with you

22:23.358 --> 22:26.594
is because I don't want
to overlook anything,

22:26.661 --> 22:29.129
and there have been times
in my past

22:29.197 --> 22:34.034
when, frankly, my passions
have overtaken my practice,

22:34.102 --> 22:35.770
and I wouldn't want that
to happen...

22:35.837 --> 22:36.904
for either of us.

22:36.972 --> 22:38.139
Okay.

22:38.207 --> 22:39.407
- Fair enough?
- Yeah.

22:39.475 --> 22:41.076
But what's going on with Nina?

22:41.144 --> 22:44.012
You shouldn't put that all
on yourself.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.249
She's a big girl.

22:47.317 --> 22:50.552
- Am I interrupting something?
- Yeah, just one second.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.922
Yeah, so I'll get that
to you right away.

22:53.990 --> 22:56.325
- Thank you, Kat.
- Yeah.

22:56.392 --> 22:58.527
Nice tie.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.197
You weren't returning
my calls.

23:02.265 --> 23:05.534
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I've been exceedingly busy.

23:05.602 --> 23:07.871
The attempted robbery
at Liberty Citizen--

23:07.939 --> 23:10.006
any progress
finding the Alpha responsible?

23:10.074 --> 23:11.375
Uh, we're working on it.

23:11.442 --> 23:13.376
Anything I can do to help?

23:13.444 --> 23:17.180
Uh, no, no, not at the moment.
Thanks.

23:17.248 --> 23:19.650
Um, anything else?

23:19.717 --> 23:22.920
Oversight committee
is asking for updates

23:22.988 --> 23:24.255
on the Building Seven
escapees.

23:24.322 --> 23:26.557
Our highest priority.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.493
I'll have the files downloaded
for you in a day or two.

23:28.561 --> 23:30.462
A day.

23:30.530 --> 23:32.097
You got a day, Lee.

23:38.497 --> 23:39.764
Nathan, I realize that,

23:40.060 --> 23:43.262
but there are only
so many hours in the day.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.532
No, you don't need to drag

23:45.600 --> 23:47.968
the oversight committee
into this.

23:48.036 --> 23:50.537
Listen, you'll have your reports
by the end of the day tomorrow.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.573
Doc, we got a lead on Nina.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.641
Cameron, I'm not sure we can
proceed with the whole thing.

23:55.709 --> 23:57.142
Oh, no, it's a good one.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.578
They found a man swimming
in Long Island Sound

23:59.646 --> 24:02.047
in his clothes,
and he had hypothermia,

24:02.115 --> 24:03.982
and he almost drowned,
and he kept trying

24:04.050 --> 24:06.819
to get back into the water,
and he couldn't even say why,

24:06.886 --> 24:09.822
and then--oh, and he had
red pepper in his pockets.

24:09.889 --> 24:11.256
Yeah, it's okay to laugh,

24:11.324 --> 24:12.858
'cause--
'cause he didn't die.

24:12.926 --> 24:14.693
This guy works on a yacht
anchored off Oyster Bay.

24:14.761 --> 24:17.296
Oh, Hicks, come on,
I was gonna say that next.

24:17.364 --> 24:18.898
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Thank you, both of you.

24:18.966 --> 24:21.000
But I'm afraid we're gonna have
to put that investigation

24:21.067 --> 24:23.336
on hold--
orders from upstairs.

24:23.403 --> 24:25.604
We need to go through the
Building Seven escapees again,

24:25.672 --> 24:27.373
so, uh, all hands.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.108
No, we can't just drop this.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.944
Orders from upstairs,
Cameron.

24:35.949 --> 24:38.984
I got the watercooler

24:39.051 --> 24:43.054
and the ever-important
break room, snacks.

24:43.122 --> 24:45.723
There he is--it's Harken,
the muscle of the outfit,

24:45.791 --> 24:47.892
although I kicked his ass
at the Alpha fights,

24:47.960 --> 24:49.627
which is interesting.
You know what?

24:49.695 --> 24:51.196
Since you're filming this,
get the facts straight, right?

24:51.263 --> 24:52.597
- Whatever.
- That's not how it happened.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.332
You are such a sore loser.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.700
There is someone here
to see you.

24:55.768 --> 24:57.870
- Who's that?
- Seems real confused.

24:57.937 --> 24:59.972
Her name's Becky.
She's out front.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.576
- Oh, thank you.
- Uh-huh. I'm number one.

25:03.643 --> 25:07.680
I'm the winner--
number one.

25:07.748 --> 25:09.616
Hey, how's it going?

25:09.683 --> 25:11.385
After you left, I was...

25:11.452 --> 25:14.722
thinking about what I said--

25:14.789 --> 25:16.924
you know, that I never
wanted to see Tommy again,

25:16.991 --> 25:18.492
and...

25:18.560 --> 25:21.396
it didn't make sense.

25:21.463 --> 25:23.164
Tommy and me--
we had our problems,

25:23.232 --> 25:27.401
but we were making it work
for Lucas.

25:27.469 --> 25:30.270
I didn't want him to go.

25:30.338 --> 25:32.439
I didn't.

25:35.343 --> 25:37.343
Well, I could hear
Becky's heart racing every time

25:37.411 --> 25:38.945
she tried to remember
what happened to her.

25:39.013 --> 25:40.413
Obviously,
Nina pushed her.

25:40.481 --> 25:42.215
If we're lucky,
Nina may still be in Oyster Bay.

25:42.283 --> 25:44.517
Listen, I think I've been
more than clear about this.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.820
We need to be focused
on the Building Seven escapees.

25:46.888 --> 25:48.622
- What?
- Doc, Nina needs us.

25:48.690 --> 25:50.158
And I need you to be focused.

25:50.225 --> 25:51.559
It's orders from upstairs.

25:51.627 --> 25:52.927
Why do you keep saying that?

25:52.995 --> 25:55.363
Doc, what the hell
are you talking about?

25:55.431 --> 25:59.267
Well, listen,
it's--

25:59.335 --> 26:02.537
- Oh, he's been pushed.
- What?

26:02.604 --> 26:03.738
What?

26:03.806 --> 26:06.074
Dr. Rosen,
you've been pushed.

26:07.843 --> 26:10.912
- Hello, Lee.
- Oh, no.

26:16.018 --> 26:18.220
What if we get caught?

26:18.288 --> 26:20.055
Come on, Nina.
It's Pearl Jam.

26:20.123 --> 26:22.158
You can get us backstage.

26:25.295 --> 26:27.230
Uh...

26:27.298 --> 26:29.699
Dad, why aren't you at work?

26:29.767 --> 26:33.337
I tried to go,
but I couldn't leave.

26:33.405 --> 26:35.339
I'm not supposed to leave.

26:35.407 --> 26:38.575
Oh, my head hurts.

26:38.643 --> 26:40.711
Is he okay?

26:40.779 --> 26:42.413
Yeah, he--he's fine.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.583
Um, Dad, you can go to work
whenever you want.

26:46.651 --> 26:49.720
Just come back
when you're done, okay?

26:49.788 --> 26:52.723
Right. I come back
when I'm finished.

26:52.790 --> 26:54.758
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

26:54.825 --> 26:56.293
Go, Dad.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.027
Hey, Tommy.
How's it going?

26:58.095 --> 26:59.696
- Good. Thanks.
- Good.

27:02.767 --> 27:05.769
- What the hell was that?
- Nothing.

27:09.307 --> 27:12.209
Tommy...

27:12.277 --> 27:13.743
All these docks
look the same to me,

27:13.811 --> 27:16.112
so, uh, give me a shout

27:16.180 --> 27:20.450
and tell me where the boat's
parked or whatever.

27:42.641 --> 27:44.809
It's Clive Christian perfume.

27:44.877 --> 27:46.678
You see her?

27:51.151 --> 27:53.919
No.

27:53.987 --> 27:56.522
All right.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.925
Nina told me
all about you, Lee.

27:59.993 --> 28:02.494
You only care
about her ability,

28:02.562 --> 28:05.130
and you only want her around
when you need something.

28:05.198 --> 28:08.968
So the party
at the club and the yacht--

28:09.035 --> 28:11.270
that wasn't exploiting
her ability?

28:11.338 --> 28:13.539
It was all just for her?

28:13.606 --> 28:15.407
I love Nina.
I always have.

28:15.475 --> 28:17.910
More than your wife and son?

28:17.978 --> 28:19.378
I never wanted that life.

28:19.446 --> 28:21.847
All I want
is to make Nina happy.

28:21.915 --> 28:23.916
Well, if you care so much
about her,

28:23.984 --> 28:25.285
then perhaps
you'll help us find her.

28:26.687 --> 28:28.087
She's in serious trouble.

28:28.155 --> 28:32.325
Seems to me she's only
in trouble if you find her.

28:32.393 --> 28:33.660
Well, perhaps
there's someone else

28:33.727 --> 28:36.529
who can convince you.

28:39.867 --> 28:42.135
Want to see your daddy?

28:42.202 --> 28:44.403
Daddy!

28:44.471 --> 28:46.739
Hey, little man.

28:55.849 --> 28:57.984
Here we go--
coffee, black, for me

28:58.051 --> 28:59.586
and chamomile tea
for the lady.

28:59.653 --> 29:01.287
Ah, that never gets old,
does it?

29:01.355 --> 29:03.656
Mmhmm. What the hell's
going on in there?

29:03.724 --> 29:04.724
He's been in there
for over an hour.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.426
We wouldn't even be here

29:06.493 --> 29:08.294
if you didn't bang that guy's
head against the cabinet.

29:08.362 --> 29:09.395
- He tripped.
- Yeah.

29:09.463 --> 29:12.631
- Mostly.
- Right, right.

29:12.699 --> 29:14.867
Which one of you
is Harken?

29:14.935 --> 29:16.302
I need some help
with my incident report

29:16.369 --> 29:17.769
out at my cruiser.

29:17.837 --> 29:20.806
That's Harken.

29:20.873 --> 29:22.674
Thanks a lot, Hicks.

29:27.079 --> 29:29.848
You want to help me.

29:31.152 --> 29:32.806
This is so far beyond
what Nina's ever done.

29:32.906 --> 29:34.406
Nina does
whatever she wants.

29:34.474 --> 29:37.276
Don't move,
either one of you.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.414
Thanks, Cam.
Wait here.

29:42.482 --> 29:43.949
Sure.

29:44.017 --> 29:46.318
What are you doing, Nina?
You've gone crazy.

29:46.386 --> 29:47.953
Shut up.

29:48.021 --> 29:49.788
Nina.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.325
Just go outside, please.

29:55.629 --> 29:57.095
Nina, you don't have
to push me.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.097
I'm not gonna try
and stop you.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.566
Will you please just
have Cameron put the gun down?

30:01.634 --> 30:04.569
No one needs to get hurt here.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.572
Put the gun down.

30:16.283 --> 30:19.053
Hey, Tommy.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.522
Let's go.
We got to get you out of here.

30:21.590 --> 30:22.656
Nina, how could you
do this to me?

30:22.724 --> 30:24.325
No, I know.
I know. I know.

30:24.393 --> 30:27.962
I never should have let them
arrest you, but I'm here now.

30:30.966 --> 30:34.402
Nina, there's
no relationship here.

30:34.470 --> 30:35.970
It's not real.

30:36.038 --> 30:38.940
You've been pushing Tommy
the whole time.

30:45.581 --> 30:48.184
No, but...

30:48.251 --> 30:51.187
you weren't happy with them.

30:51.255 --> 30:54.190
You want to be with me.
You love me.

30:54.258 --> 30:56.392
No, I don't.
You know that.

31:01.599 --> 31:03.801
Hey, Tommy.

31:03.869 --> 31:06.236
Nina.

31:10.275 --> 31:14.211
I told you
to stay away from me.

31:14.279 --> 31:17.214
Listen, I've been thinking.

31:17.282 --> 31:20.451
We should tell someone
about what you can do.

31:20.518 --> 31:23.421
What you're doing to your dad--
it's not right.

31:23.488 --> 31:27.024
Okay. I know all this
is hard for you to understand,

31:27.092 --> 31:28.425
but I'm helping him.

31:28.493 --> 31:31.429
No, you're not.
The guy is severely messed up.

31:31.496 --> 31:35.800
No, he's--he's fine,
and he's happy.

31:35.868 --> 31:39.037
If you don't tell someone
about this, I will.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.139
No, you won't.

31:41.207 --> 31:43.642
I won't let you.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.310
Oh, no.
Tommy, I'm sorry.

31:45.378 --> 31:46.778
You know
I wouldn't do that to you.

31:46.846 --> 31:48.113
You know I wouldn't do that
to you.

31:48.181 --> 31:49.381
Tommy, look at--
look at me!

31:49.449 --> 31:50.649
Stay away from me.

31:50.717 --> 31:52.117
Tommy, look at me!

32:01.361 --> 32:03.295
Bill, John,
take it easy.

32:03.363 --> 32:06.765
Cam, help.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.701
Cameron, no!

32:13.907 --> 32:15.874
Bill, Bill, go.

32:15.941 --> 32:18.676
I'll see to him.

32:18.744 --> 32:20.078
John.

32:20.145 --> 32:22.880
- John, you all right?
- The vest caught the bullet.

32:22.948 --> 32:24.948
I'm fine.
Go after Nina. I'm fine.

32:32.490 --> 32:33.556
Move!

32:41.332 --> 32:42.398
Come on, come on.

32:47.805 --> 32:51.474
Stop!

32:51.542 --> 32:53.043
Come on.

32:53.111 --> 32:55.379
Lock the exits!
I'll take the roof.

32:55.446 --> 32:57.514
Go!

33:12.364 --> 33:13.898
What the hell?

33:13.966 --> 33:16.001
Next one's
at your head, Bill.

33:16.069 --> 33:18.570
Hicks, come on,
snap out of it.

33:18.638 --> 33:21.140
Come on, man.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.175
Doc, careful.

33:25.445 --> 33:29.481
Nina!
Nina, it's Lee!

33:29.549 --> 33:32.918
I want to talk with you.

33:32.986 --> 33:34.820
Please, that's all.
I just--

33:34.887 --> 33:37.088
I just want to talk with you
for a moment.

33:37.156 --> 33:39.757
Hicks...

33:39.825 --> 33:42.626
let Rosen through,
but only him.

33:42.694 --> 33:45.062
Just you, Rosen.

33:47.866 --> 33:49.367
Yeah, I got him.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.964
It's quite a remarkable view,
isn't it?

34:18.032 --> 34:21.100
What do you want to do, Nina?

34:24.004 --> 34:27.840
Tommy and I were gonna
sail away together...

34:27.908 --> 34:29.775
just the two of us.

34:31.645 --> 34:35.848
When we were kids,
he made me so happy.

34:35.916 --> 34:39.552
You're happy.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.154
This is everything
you've always wanted.

34:43.491 --> 34:46.259
He really loved me.

34:46.326 --> 34:49.161
I know.

34:49.230 --> 34:52.764
Nina, I understand that--
that you're feeling

34:52.833 --> 34:54.534
very much alone right now,

34:54.601 --> 34:57.203
so you pushed Tommy,

34:57.271 --> 35:00.139
hoping to fill the void.

35:00.207 --> 35:02.942
You want him to be
that teenage boy again,

35:03.010 --> 35:05.411
the one who cared for you
and the one who made you happy.

35:05.479 --> 35:06.746
I understand.

35:06.814 --> 35:09.449
Yeah,
but look what I did to him.

35:09.516 --> 35:11.851
I pushed him
just like I pushed my dad.

35:11.919 --> 35:13.186
You can't leave.

35:13.254 --> 35:15.955
Oh, Nina.
That was not your fault.

35:16.023 --> 35:19.392
He wanted to leave,
and I wouldn't let him.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.428
You know, Tommy was right.

35:21.495 --> 35:24.030
You were a child then.

35:24.098 --> 35:25.966
Of course you didn't want
your father to leave.

35:26.034 --> 35:28.902
What child does?

35:28.970 --> 35:30.304
I wouldn't let him go.

35:39.247 --> 35:40.281
No!

35:40.348 --> 35:42.816
Daddy!

35:42.884 --> 35:45.419
I'm tired
of hurting people.

35:47.122 --> 35:49.189
Nina.

35:49.257 --> 35:51.758
Cameron.

35:51.826 --> 35:54.127
You're free.

35:54.195 --> 35:57.197
Do whatever you want.

36:00.535 --> 36:02.770
Thank you, Nina.

36:02.837 --> 36:03.771
Bill.

36:03.838 --> 36:06.474
I'm sorry...

36:06.542 --> 36:08.776
- Nina, no!
- For everything.

36:14.249 --> 36:16.383
I'm sorry
for everything.

36:16.451 --> 36:17.718
Nina, no!

36:30.163 --> 36:31.530
Bill!

36:46.779 --> 36:49.781
- Let me go.
- No!

36:54.988 --> 36:57.923
No, Hicks, you're slipping.
Let me go.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.101
Hold on!

37:14.206 --> 37:16.808
Ahh.

37:16.876 --> 37:18.677
Come on.

37:41.668 --> 37:44.803
Good morning, Kat.
Hey, Gary.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.973
The guy's turned
into a frickin' rooster.

37:48.041 --> 37:50.509
Day doesn't start
until Gary's crowing.

37:50.577 --> 37:53.045
It's therapeutic.
I get it.

37:53.113 --> 37:55.814
Hey, so, uh,

37:55.882 --> 37:59.385
is Nina gonna be okay?

37:59.452 --> 38:00.820
I don't know.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.155
Her past seems
pretty messed up.

38:03.223 --> 38:07.827
Makes me wonder,
if I keep working with Rosen,

38:07.894 --> 38:09.929
what I'm gonna find.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.664
It's not all bad stuff,
you know.

38:11.732 --> 38:13.766
It can be some good stuff too.

38:13.834 --> 38:16.402
Yeah, I guess.

38:16.470 --> 38:19.873
Look, I remember when,

38:19.941 --> 38:23.010
uh, my wife, Jeannie--

38:23.077 --> 38:24.845
I picked her up
to go to the Junior prom,

38:24.913 --> 38:28.649
and it was a setup,
so I'm sweating through my tux,

38:28.717 --> 38:33.221
and then here she comes
in this purple dress, and..

38:33.288 --> 38:37.426
it was--it was over for me then,

38:37.493 --> 38:41.863
and those are the memories
that can last a man a lifetime.

38:41.931 --> 38:45.900
Well, I'm betting I didn't go
to prom with Jeannie.

38:45.968 --> 38:47.969
What if I don't have a memory
like that?

38:48.036 --> 38:50.371
Well, you won't know
until you try.

38:50.438 --> 38:54.342
Look, one good memory
is worth all the bad ones.

38:57.479 --> 38:59.513
Like the time I kicked
your ass--remember that?

38:59.581 --> 39:02.183
Yep. That's not a memory.
It's made up.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.618
It's head trauma.

39:30.046 --> 39:32.615
Shouldn't you be
in the hospital?

39:32.682 --> 39:34.584
Oh, it's just a bruised rib.

39:34.651 --> 39:35.818
Oh.

39:35.886 --> 39:37.687
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

39:37.755 --> 39:41.257
Yeah, I wouldn't call her
my friend anymore, but thanks.

39:41.325 --> 39:44.160
You know, getting shot

39:44.227 --> 39:46.562
always makes me really hungry.

39:46.630 --> 39:49.665
I was gonna head out to, uh--
to a coffee shop.

39:49.733 --> 39:51.067
You want to join me?

39:51.135 --> 39:54.003
Are you asking me out
on a date?

39:54.071 --> 39:55.905
Breakfast
doesn't really count.

39:55.972 --> 39:57.206
Oh.

39:57.274 --> 39:59.509
I didn't know that.

39:59.576 --> 40:01.244
Yeah.

40:01.311 --> 40:04.313
Look, um, Rachel,

40:04.381 --> 40:08.351
about before, I was the one
who overreacted.

40:08.418 --> 40:11.253
Your vision, how it works--
I get it.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.822
You're not the only one
who's sensitive.

40:13.890 --> 40:16.425
The idea of being touched--

40:16.492 --> 40:20.896
I haven't been with anyone
since my injury.

40:20.964 --> 40:24.767
So, if we want to try this,

40:24.835 --> 40:26.802
we're gonna need
to take it slow.

40:26.870 --> 40:28.972
Slow is good.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.974
Good.

40:32.977 --> 40:35.278
You worked out
a pretty sweet deal for Nina--

40:35.346 --> 40:36.880
released into your custody,
no charges.

40:36.948 --> 40:39.583
- Nina's valuable.
- Yeah.

40:39.651 --> 40:41.685
You're lucky
she didn't kill somebody.

40:41.753 --> 40:44.755
You should've let me in.

40:44.822 --> 40:47.858
Nathan,
I couldn't take that chance.

40:47.926 --> 40:50.728
This is the last freebie
you get.

40:50.795 --> 40:53.497
Next time you shut me out,

40:53.565 --> 40:56.333
I'm throwing your ass
under the bus.

41:09.614 --> 41:11.214
How is she?

41:11.282 --> 41:14.851
Uh, it's hard to tell.

41:14.919 --> 41:18.021
You know all that stuff
with her dad?

41:18.089 --> 41:21.258
She never told me.

41:21.326 --> 41:24.461
How do you even begin to get
past something like that?

41:24.529 --> 41:27.164
With a great deal of help.

41:31.302 --> 41:34.104
Nina, it's Lee.

41:38.743 --> 41:40.977
I'm sorry about these--
these restraints.

41:41.045 --> 41:42.812
It's, uh...

41:42.880 --> 41:45.282
It's okay.

41:45.350 --> 41:48.719
I'm dangerous.

41:48.786 --> 41:52.623
No, don't, okay?
You can't trust me.

41:52.691 --> 41:54.525
Nina...

41:57.662 --> 42:00.463
look at me.

42:03.434 --> 42:05.635
Hi.
