00:02.003 --> 00:03.868
Previously on Lost:

00:03.963 --> 00:07.626
This is your daughter.
Her name's Clementine.

00:07.717 --> 00:10.254
- Those are fake.
- I'll take the one on the end.

00:11.095 --> 00:14.587
- Why'd you help me?
- One girl watching another girl's back.

00:18.603 --> 00:21.515
- Why are you telling me this?
- Just do it, Freckles.

00:24.317 --> 00:28.026
- I think we should say he's mine.
- There's other ways to do this.

00:28.112 --> 00:32.196
After everyone we've lost...
I can't lose him, too.

00:32.283 --> 00:38.199
My client insists we handle
the exchange of custody quietly.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.575
You are going to lose the boy.

00:41.334 --> 00:42.744
That's Claire's mother.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.369
Everything Kate and l have done,
it was for Aaron.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.830
Who's Aaron?

00:55.139 --> 00:58.427
- l'm Ben.
- It's nice to meet you, Ben.

01:00.436 --> 01:03.394
lfl let you out,
will you take me with you,

01:03.481 --> 01:05.972
- to your people?
- That's why I'm here.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.400
- Jin.
- What are you doing here?

01:25.169 --> 01:28.252
Hello, Jin? Are you there?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.377
Jin, can you hear me?

01:34.345 --> 01:37.178
- Hello?
- Jin? It's Phil, man!

01:37.265 --> 01:41.349
Where have you been?! The Hostile
escaped. We 're searching the east grid.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.303
- He's headed north.
- How the hell do you know that?

01:45.398 --> 01:47.514
Because he attacked me.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.644
What? Where are you?

01:52.989 --> 01:55.901
Jin, are you still there? Jin?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.906
Jin!

01:59.912 --> 02:02.073
Help...

02:02.164 --> 02:05.122
Please help.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.301
OK, everybody, listen up.

02:21.392 --> 02:24.475
We don't know yet
if another attack is coming.

02:24.562 --> 02:27.804
Everybody needs to be ready
for your security assignments.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.731
Make sure you're in contact
with your team leaders.

02:31.444 --> 02:36.984
LaFleur's got search parties out,
but the Hostile's got a good jump on us.

02:37.074 --> 02:41.033
We're pretty sure he used this fire
as a diversion in order to escape.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.241
Is he talking about Sayid?

02:45.583 --> 02:48.325
If he was locked up,
how could he start the fire?

02:49.628 --> 02:53.746
- Who are you?
- Jack... Shephard. I'm new.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.675
Well, Jack, the way he started the fire
is he had help, OK.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.627
Somebody torched that van.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.963
Then that somebody
let him out of his cell.

03:02.099 --> 03:06.513
Since the security cameras didn't pick
up any Hostiles crossing the perimeter,

03:06.604 --> 03:08.595
that means it was one of us.

03:11.609 --> 03:15.227
Baxter, I want a full report
on clean up, ASAP.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.777
You got it, Horace.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.859
Hey, you.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.452
Yeah, you.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.789
- You're in the motor pool, right?
- Yeah.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.832
You mind running that winch for me?

03:32.797 --> 03:36.460
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
do you? OK. No worries.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.051
Throw this lever,
when | tell you to stop, pull it up.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.388
- All right.
- Simple.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.337
- Don't do it till I'm ready.
- OK.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.965
All right, crank her up.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.268
So they stuck you in the motor pool
when you got here?

03:56.362 --> 03:59.229
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- Same thing happened to me.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.907
Hold it, that's good. Right there.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.450
They couldn't sucker anybody
into that sub

04:05.538 --> 04:08.530
if they told us we were gonna be
grease monkeys and janitors.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.990
- You got to start somewhere, right?
- Yeah.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.581
- What's your name?
- l'm Kate.

04:15.214 --> 04:18.547
Welcome aboard, Kate.
l'm Roger. Roger Linus.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.678
It's nice to meet you, Roger.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.776
That's my kid.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.163
That's my kid!

05:19.403 --> 05:21.314
Hi, handsome.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.396
Did you have a good sleep?

05:23.491 --> 05:26.107
Yeah, that's my boy.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.260
- Hi.
- Oh, my God!

05:50.351 --> 05:51.807
Hey, Cassidy.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.601
Oh, my God. I saw you on the news.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.020
I told all my friends,
"I know that woman."

05:57.107 --> 05:59.439
- Hi.
- This is Aaron.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.109
- Hi, Aaron?
- Say, "hi."

06:02.196 --> 06:03.732
You survived a plane crash.

06:05.157 --> 06:09.196
It's amazing. I never thought I'd see
you again, what are you doing here?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.072
Sawyer sent me.

06:38.190 --> 06:42.684
Sawyer. So that son of a bitch
is still alive?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.405
He was when I left.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.323
And he asked you to come here and
give me an envelope full of money?

06:49.868 --> 06:53.235
Well, he told me
where to find you, and...

06:54.707 --> 06:56.868
...said to take care of Clementine.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.748
- His daughter.
- She's asleep in her crib right now.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.045
Want me to wake her up?

07:07.136 --> 07:09.593
I... shouldn't have bothered you.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.887
I could've sent it.
I probably should...

07:11.974 --> 07:14.886
Why did you tell me all this?

07:14.977 --> 07:16.638
Why do you trust me?

07:17.813 --> 07:20.850
Because your daughter had a right
to know her father cared.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.187
Why didn't he come back
with the rest of you?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.692
The helicopter we were on
was running out of gas, so...

07:28.782 --> 07:31.899
...he jumped so that
we could make it to the boat.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.909
What a coward.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.793
- He was trying to do the right thing.
- He was trying to get away from you.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.584
I told him he had a daughter,

07:46.675 --> 07:49.838
he never so much as lifted a finger
to try to call her.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.386
I'm supposed to think he's a hero
because he told you to help us?

07:53.474 --> 07:55.886
Hell, I'll bet this money
isn't even his, is it?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.936
They gave us a settlement,
I didn't need...

08:01.023 --> 08:03.890
You don't have to explain it, Kate.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.734
You got the same look on your face
I did when he ditched me.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.608
All l have for you is sympathy.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.153
- Is it his?
- What?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.624
Your son.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.412
Is it Sawyer's?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.416
No. No, l was...

08:27.633 --> 08:29.999
...pregnant before I met him.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.429
That's not your baby, is it?

08:43.524 --> 08:46.231
Kate, you just told me
you and your friends

08:46.318 --> 08:50.436
cooked a story for the whole world
about what happened on that island.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.442
So you tell me the truth about that.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.945
Why are you lying to me about him?

08:59.790 --> 09:01.781
Because I have to.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.894
- What happened?
- What the hell are you doing here?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.822
That was Ben.
That kid who was shot was Ben.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.321
- Was it Sayid? Did he shoot him?
- Here's what you need to do:

09:38.412 --> 09:41.119
Keep your mouth shut
and stop asking questions.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.698
Any attention on yourself
is the last thing I need. Now scram.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.626
- | just want to know what's going on.
- LaFleur!

09:48.380 --> 09:52.669
What... What's she doing here?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.258
- This is...
- l'm Kate.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.506
Kate. She's new over at the motor pool.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.886
l was seeing if she saw
anything suspicious, but she didn't.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.341
You can run along. Thanks.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.730
Have you checked the Hostile's cell yet?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.354
l was busy trying to keep
the town from burning.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.310
OK, then let's do it.

10:19.203 --> 10:22.491
He didn't break out.
Somebody let him out.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.991
These are janitor's keys.

10:24.082 --> 10:28.121
We've only got three janitors:
there's Roger, Willie

10:28.212 --> 10:32.125
and that new guy.
I just met him. His name's Jack.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.628
I brought him in from the sub.
I'll talk to him.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.460
- Miles, you wanna come with me?
- Yeah, sure, boss.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.971
I want you to find Jack and Hurley
and Kate quick as you can.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.473
- Put them in a house and sit on them.
- What for?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.726
I don't want them talking to anybody
Things are out of control.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.682
- All right. I got it.
- All right, go.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.864
Who did this?
Do you know who did this to my son?

10:59.952 --> 11:02.819
- We're working on it. How's he doing?
- I don't know.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.949
Juliet told me to wait out here.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.406
- Let me see if I can get an update.
- Thanks, Jim.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.455
Roger, you have your keys with you?

11:11.547 --> 11:13.208
Yeah. Why, what do you need?

11:16.885 --> 11:21.299
- I must have left them at the house.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.139
More gauze.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.021
- Here's some gauze.
- ln here.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.848
Here you go.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.276
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging,
we're gonna have to pack the tract.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.443
OK.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.023
- Where's the doctor?
- The Looking Glass station till Friday.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.279
- How's he doing?
- Not well.

11:43.370 --> 11:47.363
Hold on. He's still bleeding in there
somewhere, and I can't fix it.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.199
- It's all right.
- No, it is not all right.

11:50.294 --> 11:54.162
Someone needs to get in there, find
the damage that bullet did and fix it.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.587
He needs a real surgeon.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.798
You're telling us...
we're under house arrest?

12:05.893 --> 12:08.509
No. You're all free to leave
whenever you want.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.265
But I'll shoot you in the leg.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.273
- Whose idea was this?
- Who do you think?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.686
Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.907
- What the hell are you doing, Tubby?
- Checking to see if I'm disappearing.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.489
- What?
- Back to the Future, man.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.792
We came back in time to the island
and changed stuff.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.996
So if little Ben dies,
he'll never grow up to be big Ben,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.251
whose the one who made us
come back here.

12:39.343 --> 12:43.962
Which means we can't be here.
And therefore, dude? We don't exist.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.139
You're an idiot.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.888
- Am I?
- Yeah. It doesn't work like that.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.970
You can't change anything.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.933
Your maniac lraqi buddy shot Linus.
That is what always happened...

12:57.027 --> 13:00.940
It's just... we never experienced
how it all turns out.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.527
- That was really confusing.
- Yeah, well... get used to it.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.952
But the good news is
that Linus didn't die,

13:13.043 --> 13:16.126
so that means the kid can't either.
He'll be fine.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.455
Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.
What if you're wrong?

13:19.549 --> 13:22.677
Well, if I'm wrong then
I guess we all stop existing,

13:22.761 --> 13:25.377
and none of it
matters anyway then, does it?

13:29.559 --> 13:33.427
- Doc, I need you to come with me.
- Come with you where?

13:33.522 --> 13:36.264
Kid's losing blood,
we ain't got none to put in him,

13:36.358 --> 13:39.145
so we need you to show us
where he sprung a leak.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.522
No.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.243
- What?
- No. I'm not coming with you.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.705
If you don't come with me,
that kid's gonna die.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.046
Then he dies.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.278
What are you doing?

14:27.951 --> 14:31.864
I'm making sandwiches. Figured
everybody'd be getting hungry by now.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.913
He's just a boy, Jack.
You can'tjust let him die.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.459
You heard Miles. We can't change
what's already happened.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.630
- This has nothing to do with me.
- Unless you're supposed to save him.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.384
Thirty years from now
that boy is going to be a man

14:47.471 --> 14:50.133
that locks me in a cage
because he needs surgery.

14:50.223 --> 14:54.216
Then you're going to come in and
you're going to beg me to operate on him

14:54.311 --> 14:56.802
because he's threatening
to murder Sawyer.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.808
I've already done this once.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.313
I've already saved Benjamin Linus.
And I did it for you, Kate.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.730
I don't need to do it again.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.904
This is our fault.

15:11.995 --> 15:15.362
We brought Sayid back.
We caused this.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.245
When we were here before, I spent
all of my time trying to fix things.

15:19.336 --> 15:24.000
But did you ever think that maybe the
island just wants to fix things itself?

15:25.884 --> 15:29.547
That maybe I was just...
getting in the way?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.351
You know, I don't like the new you.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.266
I liked the old you...

15:37.354 --> 15:40.812
...who wouldn't just sit around
and wait for things to happen.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.900
You didn't like the old me, Kate.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.866
Hey, where are you going?

16:04.381 --> 16:07.669
Just try to relax. You're OK.

16:10.345 --> 16:14.054
I'm sorry... Juliet?
One of the new people is here.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.508
She heard Ben needed blood,
says she's a universal donor.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.940
This might hurt for a second.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.903
Good, very brave.

16:36.079 --> 16:40.869
So James told me that Jack
wouldn't help, but he didn't say why.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.918
If I understood why Jack does what
he does, I wouldn't be sitting here.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.706
Off-island did something happen
with you two?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.086
We were engaged.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.752
Does that count?

16:57.642 --> 17:00.349
- What's going on?
- | asked you to wait outside...

17:00.437 --> 17:03.224
- What's going on with my kid?
- Kate is giving blood

17:03.315 --> 17:04.851
SO WE can transfuse Ben...

17:06.651 --> 17:10.189
- Well, I'm not waiting outside.
- He can stay with me.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.066
Then you could check on Ben,

17:12.157 --> 17:15.695
and Roger here could keep me company,
make sure I don't pass out.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.075
OK. Roger, have a seat.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.795
- Thanks.
- Sure.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.552
- He stole my keys.
- Sorry?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.972
LaFleur asked me where my keys were.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.890
That bastard doesn't ask any questions
he doesn't know the answers to.

17:43.980 --> 17:48.474
Which means my son stole my keys so
he could bust that animal out ofjail.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.434
Why would he do that?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.480
Because of me.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.736
You got kids?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.448
No.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.541
I thought I was going to be
the greatest father ever.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.677
I guess it didn't work out that way.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.215
What about his mother, she still around?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.890
No, she's dead.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.348
She died the day he was born.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.106
Sorry.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.185
Yeah... me, too.

18:35.407 --> 18:38.365
I tried to do what I thought
she would want me to.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.859
But...

18:41.830 --> 18:43.866
I guess a boy just needs his mother.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.296
- What's going on?
- He's going into hypoxic shock.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.046
- What does that mean?
- He needs oxygen. Roger, out of here.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.252
- What?
- Get him out!

18:58.346 --> 19:00.723
- Wait! What...
- Please, Roger, just wait outside.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.138
Wait a minute.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.895
Let me get this straight.

19:08.982 --> 19:13.146
- All this already happened?
- Yes.

19:13.236 --> 19:17.354
So this conversation we're having
right now, we already had it?

19:17.449 --> 19:20.532
- Yes!
- Then what am I gonna say next?

19:21.661 --> 19:25.324
- I don't know.
- Then your theory is wrong!

19:25.415 --> 19:29.749
For the thousandth time, you dingbat,
the conversation already happened,

19:29.836 --> 19:34.580
but not for you and me. For you and me,
it's happening right now.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.841
OK, answer me this:

19:37.927 --> 19:40.760
If all this already happened to me,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.338
then... why don't I remember any of it?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.516
Because once Ben turned that wheel,

19:46.603 --> 19:51.267
time isn't a straight line
for us anymore.

19:51.358 --> 19:55.226
Our experiences
in the past and the future

19:55.320 --> 19:59.438
occurred before
these experiences right now.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.401
Say that again?

20:09.459 --> 20:12.371
Shoot me. Please. Please?

20:12.462 --> 20:15.704
I can't shoot you
because if you die in 1977,

20:15.799 --> 20:19.291
you'll never come to the island
on the freighter 30 years from now!

20:19.386 --> 20:23.629
I can die! Because I've already come
to the island on the freighter.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.341
Any of us can die,
because this is our present.

20:27.435 --> 20:31.053
You said Ben couldn't die because
he has to become leader of the Others.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.933
Because this is his past.

20:33.024 --> 20:37.233
But when we first captured Ben
and Sayid, like, tortured him,

20:37.320 --> 20:42.155
then why wouldn't he remember getting
shot by that same guy when he was a kid?

20:52.127 --> 20:53.833
I hadn't thought of that.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.518
- How is he?
- He's stable.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.594
Is he gonna be OK?

21:13.690 --> 21:16.102
He's got fresh blood,
which is a good thing.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.353
Roger, go out to the medical station.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.107
There's supplies there
that we don't have here.

21:21.197 --> 21:25.031
OK. Hey... ljust want to say...

21:25.118 --> 21:28.360
I want to say thanks.
I know you're doing everything you can.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.821
To save him.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.533
All right, I'm going to go, OK?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.296
Is he any better?

21:45.763 --> 21:47.219
He is stable now.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.966
But I can't...

21:51.060 --> 21:53.472
- I can't fix it...
- What about the sub?

21:53.563 --> 21:55.144
- Can we take him somewhere?
- No.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.598
- It's gone, won't be back for months.
- But he can't die, right?

21:58.693 --> 22:03.904
He is going to die. He's in a
medical situation that's not resolvable.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.651
We can't sit and do nothing.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.234
There's got to be someone
who can help him. We have an entire...

22:14.459 --> 22:15.699
What?

22:21.341 --> 22:25.425
- Maybe there's something they can do.
- "They"?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.129
The Others.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.687
- You got him?
- Yeah.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.023
Ready? One, two, three, go.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.034
OK, let's go.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.921
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no, no.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.876
If something goes wrong it doesn't
matter for me. You got a life here.

23:07.971 --> 23:11.088
Besides, if Sawyer knew
I got you involved, he'd kill me.

23:11.808 --> 23:15.517
- How are you going to manage?
- l'll manage. Don't worry.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.471
Kate... Sawyer's going to find out
Ben's gone,

23:20.567 --> 23:23.183
and when he does,
I have to tell him what happened.

23:23.278 --> 23:26.691
But I'll give you as much
of a head start as I can.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.146
Good luck.

23:38.668 --> 23:43.207
There is someone,
someone here in Los Angeles.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.630
- Let me take you to them.
- Who?

23:45.717 --> 23:48.675
The same person that's going
to show us back to the island.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.259
Is that what this is about?

23:54.350 --> 23:56.306
- You knew?
- No, l was...

23:56.394 --> 23:59.557
You're pretending to care about Aaron
to convince me to go back?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.434
- I wasn't pretending!
- This is insane. You are crazy.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.026
- Kate...
- Jack! Don't!

24:15.038 --> 24:18.747
Mommy, l'm thirsty. I need some milk.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.703
Price check on two.
Need a price check on two.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.382
- You want chocolate milk or regular?
- Juice box.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.008
- You don't want milk anymore?
- Juice box.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.638
Excuse me, where are yourjuice boxes?

24:39.729 --> 24:42.436
- Aisle five.
- Thank you very much.

24:43.149 --> 24:47.563
No waiting on checkstand three.
No waiting on checkstand three.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.947
Aaron?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.579
Here you go. Thanks.

25:04.796 --> 25:07.128
- Excuse me, have you seen my son?
- Sorry?

25:07.215 --> 25:09.046
Little three-year-old blond kid...

25:10.093 --> 25:13.631
Aaron! Aaron!

25:15.056 --> 25:16.091
Aaron!

25:18.726 --> 25:20.262
Aaron!

25:29.362 --> 25:32.695
Excuse me, I've lost my son.
He's three, he's a blond boy...

25:32.782 --> 25:36.149
- We'll make an announcement.
- No. You have to seal the store.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.123
Aaron?

25:41.207 --> 25:43.493
- Hey!
- Is this your mommy?

25:43.584 --> 25:46.747
Honey, is this your mommy?
I found him in the fruit section.

25:46.838 --> 25:50.126
He looked lost. I was
getting ready to make an announcement.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.175
Thank you. Thank you very much.

25:55.263 --> 25:56.673
Sure.

25:59.767 --> 26:03.601
It's OK, honey. Mommy's got you.
Mommy's got you.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.292
Tell my...

26:33.801 --> 26:37.089
- Tell my...
- Try not to talk, OK?

26:37.180 --> 26:40.343
Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.

27:05.291 --> 27:09.876
I know you got to stop me,
but I can'tjust let that kid die.

27:12.673 --> 27:15.460
Damn it, Freckles,
I ain't here to stop you...

27:17.887 --> 27:19.548
I'm here to help you.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.857
- Hi, Auntie Kate!
- Hi, Clementine.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.238
- Is your mommy home?
- Sure, I'll get her.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.364
OK.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.871
They're going back to the island?

27:48.543 --> 27:51.660
- Why in God's name would they do that?
- I don't know.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.746
Jack says that
we weren't supposed to leave.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.249
Well, Jack sounds like a piece of work.

27:58.886 --> 28:01.172
You look exhausted. Drink this,

28:01.264 --> 28:04.552
curl up on my bed, take a nap.
I'll watch your fella.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.847
I lost him.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.145
- What?
- I don't know what happened.

28:15.236 --> 28:18.694
We were in the supermarket and
I turned around for one second,

28:18.781 --> 28:20.612
and he was gone.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.986
And you know,
the crazy thing is, is that...

28:27.039 --> 28:29.291
As scared as l was...

28:31.335 --> 28:33.246
...I wasn't surprised.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.918
All I could think was...
"It's about time."

28:41.470 --> 28:43.847
Why would I feel that way?

28:43.931 --> 28:45.967
Why would I expect him to be taken?

28:48.811 --> 28:50.847
Because you took him, Kate.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.102
No, l...

28:57.403 --> 28:59.439
Claire was gone.

29:00.114 --> 29:04.073
She left him.
I had to take him. He needed me.

29:07.705 --> 29:09.912
You needed him.

29:14.170 --> 29:17.503
Sawyer broke your heart.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.503
How else were you supposed to fix it?

29:35.107 --> 29:38.440
Figure out how you were gonna
carry him out there by yourself?

29:38.527 --> 29:40.108
The line's right over there.

29:40.196 --> 29:43.688
- Others are on the other side?
- They ain't right on the other side.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.691
- We better get moving.
- Hey.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.699
Why are you doing this?
Why are you helping me?

29:52.833 --> 29:56.872
When I found out Ben was gone
and Juliet told me what you were up to,

29:56.963 --> 29:59.079
| asked that exact damn question.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.209
Why are you helping Ben?

30:03.552 --> 30:05.964
And she said...

30:06.055 --> 30:09.968
...no matter what he's gonna grow up
to be, it's wrong to let a kid die.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.726
So...

30:16.649 --> 30:18.514
...that's why I'm doing this.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.561
I'm doing it for her.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.461
Where's Jack?

30:41.549 --> 30:44.507
- He's in the shower.
- Is he in trouble?

30:44.593 --> 30:46.379
| just need to talk to him.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.426
You two mind giving us some privacy?

30:53.144 --> 30:56.261
Hey. Ask me more questions
about time travel.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.865
- I needed you.
- I'm sorry?

31:08.951 --> 31:13.536
That kid was bleeding out,
you're a surgeon, and I needed you.

31:13.622 --> 31:17.080
- That kid is Ben.
- It's not Ben yet. He's just a kid.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.792
Juliet, I'm sorry, I can't help you.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.793
I'm not asking for your help. You made
it clear you weren't interested.

31:26.510 --> 31:30.298
- It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.
- What?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.004
She's trying to save him.

31:32.099 --> 31:36.718
And I sent James after her to help,
because they actually care.

31:37.605 --> 31:41.393
I came back here because I care, Juliet.
l was trying to save you.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.691
We didn't need saving!

31:43.778 --> 31:46.485
We've been fine for three years.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.314
You came back here for you.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.492
At least do me the courtesy
of telling me why.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.244
I came back...

32:05.007 --> 32:06.998
...because I was supposed to.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.631
Supposed to do what?

32:12.223 --> 32:13.713
I don't know yet.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.641
Well, you'd better figure it out.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.941
I can take him for awhile.

32:34.537 --> 32:35.993
Sure you can.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.744
His father said
you think Ben broke Sayid out.

32:43.420 --> 32:47.333
A kid will do almost anything if
he's pissed off enough at his folks.

32:48.217 --> 32:51.254
Is that why you asked me
to take care of your daughter?

32:57.268 --> 32:59.725
- Did you?
- Of course I did.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.934
- Go ahead and take a sip.
- What's she like?

33:05.025 --> 33:06.981
Clementine?

33:07.069 --> 33:11.733
- Yeah. Clementine.
- Oh, she's beautiful.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.780
Looks just like you when she smiles.

33:14.785 --> 33:18.824
She's growing up fast.
Already has a little attitude.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.873
Bet you and Cassidy
had a lot to talk about.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.994
She had an interesting theory
on why you jumped off the chopper.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.296
Yeah? What's that?

33:29.925 --> 33:33.088
You were worried about
what would happen if you didn't.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.729
You and me would have
never worked out, Kate.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.027
I wasn't any more fit
to be your boyfriend

33:49.111 --> 33:51.443
than I am to be
that little girl's father.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.564
You seem to be doing
all right with Juliet.

33:57.703 --> 34:01.571
Yeah. I've done a lot of growing up
in the past three years.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.699
Hands up!

34:06.962 --> 34:08.543
Do not move!

34:10.424 --> 34:13.666
I said don't move.
This is a violation of the truce.

34:13.761 --> 34:15.797
- You're over the line!
- We know.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.378
This kid's been shot.

34:17.473 --> 34:20.886
That's both of our problem,
so unless you want to go to war...

34:20.976 --> 34:23.809
...you're gonna take us
to Richard Alpert.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.682
And you're gonna do it now.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.825
Mrs. Littleton... l'm Kate Austen.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.958
I know who you are.

34:55.678 --> 34:57.088
Come in.

34:57.638 --> 34:58.673
Thank you.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.596
Your friend, Dr. Shephard,
came here last night,

35:08.691 --> 35:12.024
going on and on about
some person named Aaron.

35:13.696 --> 35:16.153
When I asked him who that was,

35:16.240 --> 35:18.731
he ran out of here
like the room was on fire.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.532
He's your grandson.

35:29.545 --> 35:31.627
And your daughter, Claire...

35:32.881 --> 35:34.087
...is alive.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.263
What are you talking about?

35:40.347 --> 35:43.931
- Claire died in the plane crash.
- No. She survived.

35:44.018 --> 35:47.681
When we crashed,
your daughter was eight months pregnant.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.022
She's the one who
gave birth on the island, not me.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.645
We lied.

35:53.736 --> 35:56.944
There were other survivors, too.
We just left them behind.

35:58.073 --> 36:02.737
Why? Why would you leave her there?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.702
Because she disappeared, and...

36:05.789 --> 36:09.247
...she left the baby behind.
We looked everywhere, but...

36:11.587 --> 36:14.203
That's when I started
taking care of Aaron.

36:17.051 --> 36:21.420
When we were rescued, we didn't...
We had to decide what to do with him.

36:22.598 --> 36:25.840
I knew she had wanted him
to be adopted, but I couldn't...

36:28.103 --> 36:32.267
I had to protect him.
So I said he was mine.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.308
Why did you lie?

36:36.403 --> 36:38.940
Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

36:43.452 --> 36:45.192
Because I needed him.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.662
I'm sorry.

36:56.256 --> 37:00.465
You're gonna see that he's so sweet,
and kind and good.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.553
Where is he?

37:10.145 --> 37:13.353
I checked in two doors down.
He's asleep.

37:14.108 --> 37:17.316
I know that this is a lot
for you to handle.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.769
But...

37:20.989 --> 37:24.322
...when you're ready,
he's waiting for you.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.323
I told him you're his grandmother...

37:30.332 --> 37:33.369
...that you'll take care of him
while I'm gone.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.621
And that I'll be back soon.

37:38.048 --> 37:39.959
Where are you going?

37:42.511 --> 37:45.173
I'm going back to find your daughter.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.075
Bye-bye, baby.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.843
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

39:15.938 --> 39:19.180
- Shut up and keep moving.
- What's it look like I'm doing?

39:19.274 --> 39:20.730
Hello there, James.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.523
Where'd you come from?

39:25.614 --> 39:28.276
You asked my people to bring you to me.
Here I am.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.536
Is that Benjamin Linus?

39:32.913 --> 39:34.574
You two know each other?

39:38.043 --> 39:40.625
- What happened to him?
- He was shot.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.620
- And who might you be?
- She's with me.

39:45.342 --> 39:48.630
- And why are you here?
- Because we need you to save his life.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.930
Can you?

40:03.151 --> 40:06.735
If I take him, he's not ever
going to be the same again.

40:07.531 --> 40:08.896
What do you mean by that?

40:08.991 --> 40:11.403
What I mean is that...

40:11.493 --> 40:14.326
...he will forget this
ever happened, and that...

40:15.497 --> 40:17.863
...his innocence will be gone.

40:22.129 --> 40:24.120
He will always be one of us.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.839
Do you still want me to take him?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.465
Yes.

40:42.524 --> 40:43.764
Richard...

40:45.485 --> 40:48.101
You shouldn't do this
without asking Ellie.

40:50.407 --> 40:54.400
- I don't answer to either of them.
- Where are you taking him?

40:58.498 --> 40:59.704
Come on.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.936
Hello, Ben.

42:15.701 --> 42:18.363
Welcome back to the land of the living.
