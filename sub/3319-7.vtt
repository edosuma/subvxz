00:01.914 --> 00:04.526
[phone rings]

00:04.613 --> 00:05.962
[moans softly]

00:07.398 --> 00:08.312
Hello?

00:08.399 --> 00:09.313
Are you awake?

00:11.011 --> 00:11.881
At 2:30 in the morning?

00:11.968 --> 00:14.971
You betcha.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.886
I think I'm pregnant.

00:16.973 --> 00:20.020
Oh, God, can I not be awake?

00:22.761 --> 00:24.285
How is that even possible?

00:24.372 --> 00:26.461
What kind of question is that?

00:26.548 --> 00:29.507
I happen to be in
the bloom of my life.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.683
Half the men in Napa Valley

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
have been in
the bloom of your life.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.037
What?

00:37.124 --> 00:38.647
Nothing.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.430
Did you take a test?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.911
I don't need to.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.478
I've got all the signs.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.783
I missed my period, I'm moody,

00:44.870 --> 00:47.047
my nipples are
incredibly angry.

00:47.134 --> 00:50.224
Trust me, there's fruit
in these loins.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.358
No, no, no.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.968
My daughter and my mother

00:56.056 --> 00:58.319
cannot be pregnant
at the same time.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.147
I don't have the strength.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.018
Please don't make
this about you.

01:04.325 --> 01:07.241
Okay, look, maybe we're
worrying for no reason.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.720
First thing tomorrow morning,

01:08.807 --> 01:10.070
we'll get you
a doctor's appointment

01:10.157 --> 01:11.593
just to be sure.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.812
Oh, God, why is
this happening to me?

01:13.899 --> 01:15.249
Honestly?

01:15.336 --> 01:18.861
Do we need to have
the talk again?

01:18.948 --> 01:21.603
I devoted the best years
of my life

01:21.690 --> 01:23.170
to loving and nurturing a child.

01:23.257 --> 01:26.651
This was supposed to be my time.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.393
Boy, I would love
to meet that child.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.353
Look, I gotta
go back to sleep.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.268
But what am I supposed to do?

01:34.355 --> 01:35.356
I don't know.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.792
Grab your calendar

01:36.879 --> 01:37.923
and see if you can figure out

01:38.010 --> 01:40.012
who the father is.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.579
Oh...

01:41.666 --> 01:43.103
[crying loudly]

01:43.190 --> 01:46.062
BONNIE:
Are you freakin' kidding me?!

01:46.149 --> 01:49.196
You're a lying son of a bitch!

01:49.283 --> 01:53.417
You shouldn't even be allowed
to practice in this country!

01:53.504 --> 01:55.158
Menopause, my ass.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.470
Hate to be her daughter.

02:19.922 --> 02:23.273
[sighs]

02:23.360 --> 02:24.579
What are
you doing?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.276
I'm hot.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.756
Get back
in the car.

02:27.843 --> 02:28.800
You look like
a Labradoodle.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.325
Ugh...

02:31.412 --> 02:33.718
I think I just ate a bug.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.503
[gags]

02:35.590 --> 02:36.678
You know, menopause
isn't the end of the world.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.810
Easy for you to say.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.899
You can still provide
a king with an heir.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.466
Oh, get real.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.685
The only king
you've got a shot with

02:43.772 --> 02:45.469
is the King of Big Screens.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.037
All I am saying is

02:48.124 --> 02:49.604
what if I were to meet someone?

02:49.691 --> 02:50.692
Maybe a young guy
who wants a family.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.998
You have a family.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.175
That doesn't mean I can't try
for a better one.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.743
Want to know what I have
to look forward to?

02:58.830 --> 02:59.788
Ah...

02:59.875 --> 03:02.443
Hot flashes, weight gain,

03:02.530 --> 03:03.922
decreased sex drive,

03:04.009 --> 03:05.794
incontinence.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.884
What kind of man is gonna want
a piece of that action?

03:08.971 --> 03:10.581
I'm sure there's a Web site

03:10.668 --> 03:11.756
for guys who are into fat,
sweaty bed-wetters.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.935
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this fun for you?

03:17.022 --> 03:19.634
Oh, come on, I'm just
trying to lighten the mood.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.244
And yes.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.420
Oh, look.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.380
A tester tube
of vaginal lubricant.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.468
Why don't
they just put

03:27.555 --> 03:29.296
a gun in here?

03:31.167 --> 03:32.603
Instead of focusing
on all the cons,

03:32.690 --> 03:34.562
why don't we try
to make a list of the pros?

03:34.649 --> 03:35.780
Like...

03:35.867 --> 03:37.260
no more birth control worries.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.914
Right. If I were worried

03:39.001 --> 03:40.872
about birth control,
you wouldn't exist.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.397
Okay, pro:

03:43.484 --> 03:44.920
no more PMS.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.749
So now when I'm a bitch
I'm just a bitch?

03:47.836 --> 03:50.186
All righty.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.709
Pro...

03:51.796 --> 03:53.668
you're entering
the time in your life

03:53.755 --> 03:54.973
when you give back

03:55.060 --> 03:56.453
to loved ones
and community.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.195
Oh, please, now you're
just making stuff up.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.240
Oh, God,

04:00.327 --> 04:01.850
where did the years go?

04:01.937 --> 04:02.894
You wasted 'em.

04:03.939 --> 04:04.940
I mean...

04:05.027 --> 04:06.855
it's gonna
be okay.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.335
[sobbing]

04:08.422 --> 04:10.989
No, it's never
gonna be okay again.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.078
[sobbing]

04:16.908 --> 04:17.909
Mom. Three o'clock.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.526
Are you okay?

04:25.613 --> 04:26.744
No, not really.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.704
Would a ride cheer you up?

04:29.791 --> 04:31.923
Don't you dare.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.274
I deserve this.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.973
Yeah, I think it would.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.063
All right.
Hop on.

04:42.325 --> 04:45.023
I'll call you later.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.026
Stop, you're making
a terrible mistake!

04:48.113 --> 04:48.897
Don't worry about me.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.073
Worry about him.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.162
I was talking to him!

04:57.166 --> 04:58.298
Hey.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.864
Mom, do you like
circumcised men?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.435
Um, can I put my purse down

05:05.522 --> 05:07.916
before we have
this conversation?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.352
Well, if we
have a boy,

05:09.439 --> 05:10.875
Luke wants to get
the baby snipped.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.921
Not snipped,
streamlined.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.011
Tell him it's not necessary.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.621
Oh, God.

05:17.708 --> 05:18.579
Luke, why don't you
have this conversation

05:18.666 --> 05:20.058
with your own parents?

05:20.145 --> 05:22.060
'Cause his parents
don't know I'm pregnant.

05:23.018 --> 05:23.932
Wait, what?

05:24.019 --> 05:24.976
You told me

05:25.063 --> 05:26.108
they were thrilled

05:26.195 --> 05:27.239
and totally supportive.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.807
Yeah, well...

05:29.894 --> 05:30.982
that was sort of a...

05:31.069 --> 05:34.899
you know, lie.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.467
Luke, why didn't you tell them?

05:37.554 --> 05:38.425
He's scared of 'em.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.643
No, I'm not scared.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.253
It's just...
complicated.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.254
They're not
cool like you.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.431
My mother's not cool.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.345
Hang on.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.043
Let the boy talk.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.306
I was just waiting
for the right time.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.699
Which would be when?

05:51.786 --> 05:54.571
I don't know.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.312
They're old,
they could die soon.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.096
Problem solved.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.882
Oh, sweetie, don't
wish for that.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.840
Besides,
it doesn't work.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.668
If anything, the
parent lives longer.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.193
You need to
tell your folks

06:08.280 --> 06:09.891
and you need to
do it immediately.[moans]

06:09.978 --> 06:11.283
Oh, sack up.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.894
Did they snip off
all of your penis?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.854
Violet, be nice.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.813
Go ahead.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.858
You can do it.

06:23.861 --> 06:24.993
Would you maybe
come with me?

06:27.256 --> 06:29.606
This is something
you have to do yourself.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.565
Encourage him.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.130
Oh, be a man.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.658
Seriously?

06:40.661 --> 06:42.967
The chef is especially happy
with the catch of the day,

06:43.054 --> 06:45.013
which is a Copper River
salmon, and...

06:45.100 --> 06:46.971
Psst.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.887
Need to talk.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.802
Sorry. Uh...

06:51.889 --> 06:53.325
the salmon is pan-seared

06:53.413 --> 06:55.502
with fingerling potatoes
and savoy spinach.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.199
BONNIE:
Fingerling...

06:57.286 --> 07:00.724
Uh, the other specials
are heritage pork chop,

07:00.811 --> 07:02.683
Kobe beef
and Maine lobster,

07:02.770 --> 07:04.249
which is flown in daily from...

07:04.336 --> 07:06.034
Anyone? Anyone?

07:06.121 --> 07:07.209
[imitates buzzer]
Maine.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.385
Okay, uh, I'll be right back.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.908
Mom.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.910
What's going on?

07:12.997 --> 07:15.260
My vagina is dead.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.830
What the hell are
you talking about?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.615
That motorcycle guy.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.443
I took him back to my place,
stripped off his clothes,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.357
ran my tongue up and down
his gorgeous body

07:25.445 --> 07:26.794
and felt nothing.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.230
It was like I was
licking a rock.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.233
I'm confused.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.321
Did you sleep
with him or not?

07:32.408 --> 07:34.410
Not. I mean, I tried,

07:34.497 --> 07:36.238
but it was like
I-I couldn't get it up.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.765
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was
Take Your Mother to Work Day.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.854
Yeah, it comes
right after

07:43.941 --> 07:46.117
Sleep with Your
Married Boss Week.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.033
Carry on.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.516
Well, well.

07:53.603 --> 07:56.127
Who's this beautiful,
wounded bird?

07:56.214 --> 07:58.434
Don't waste your time.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.914
I'm numb from the neck down.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.611
Hmm.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.787
So the head's still in play?

08:09.097 --> 08:11.012
[frantic knocking,
doorbell ringing wildly]

08:11.099 --> 08:14.798
Hold your horses,
I'm coming.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.626
Ta-da!

08:20.195 --> 08:21.544
I figured it out.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.328
I'm not giving up.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.113
If I'm gonna go down,
I'm gonna go down fighting.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.246
If it stands up to pee,
I'm banging it.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.685
Glad to hear it.

08:31.772 --> 08:32.903
Let me introduce you

08:32.990 --> 08:34.948
to Luke's parents.

08:35.035 --> 08:38.692
Nathan and Mary, this
is my mother, Bonnie.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.217
Howdy-do.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.795
I just want to thank
both of you

08:54.882 --> 08:56.536
for coming over so we can
discuss the, uh...

08:56.623 --> 08:58.538
Child conceived
in sin?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.540
[sobbing]

09:03.586 --> 09:05.632
You're right,
I am the cool parent.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.679
Luke, did you

09:09.766 --> 09:11.159
learn nothing

09:11.246 --> 09:12.464
from your father's
Bible class?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.641
I'm sorry, what?

09:14.728 --> 09:16.338
Bible class?
MARY:
Yes.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.774
Nathan is
the head pastor

09:17.861 --> 09:19.254
at the Baptist Church
in Santa Rosa.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.518
[laughing]:
Oh, that's just hilarious.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.694
[laughing]:
Right?

09:26.217 --> 09:27.915
I'm so sorry, Father.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.658
All right,
I just want to say

09:31.745 --> 09:33.877
that we've all really
come to love your son

09:33.964 --> 09:35.705
and I know that my daughter
is crazy about him,

09:35.792 --> 09:37.315
so I'm sure there's

09:37.402 --> 09:39.100
a happy ending
in here somewhere.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.667
If Violet just gave him
a happy ending, we...

09:40.754 --> 09:42.712
Mom!

09:45.019 --> 09:49.110
I'm sorry, I-I'm about
a quart low on the estrogen.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.633
Ah.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.939
You know what
I'm talking about, right?

09:54.028 --> 09:55.116
NATHAN:
Look...

09:55.203 --> 09:56.639
here's what's
going to happen.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.598
All of this nonsense
about these two kids

09:58.685 --> 10:00.034
getting married
after high school

10:00.121 --> 10:01.513
is just that,
nonsense.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.863
It is not
going to happen.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.213
Now, as far as
the child is concerned,

10:05.300 --> 10:06.606
Luke will provide
financial support,

10:06.693 --> 10:07.650
if in fact it turns
out to be his.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.783
What?

10:09.870 --> 10:11.001
Violet, I got this.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.612
What?

10:12.699 --> 10:13.743
We don't know for sure

10:13.830 --> 10:16.180
that our son
is the only boy

10:16.267 --> 10:17.791
your little temptress
has been with.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.880
Okay, buddy.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.316
Let's get
something clear...

10:21.403 --> 10:23.797
Christy, I got this.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.668
Here's all you need to know
about this family.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.670
With every generation,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.846
we are getting better.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.543
That's right.

10:33.763 --> 10:37.288
So, I may have been
a drunken slut...

10:37.375 --> 10:39.595
She was.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.684
...and my daughter may have been
a drunken slut...

10:41.771 --> 10:42.772
Hang on a second.

10:42.859 --> 10:43.860
What?

10:43.947 --> 10:45.819
Never mind.
Go on.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.735
...but my granddaughter,
this tender angel,

10:48.822 --> 10:52.173
she was pure
as the driven snow

10:52.260 --> 10:54.218
until she smoked your son's
weed, drank his tequila,

10:54.305 --> 10:57.657
and then made passionate love
with him for about two minutes.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.791
Am I telling it
right, honey?

11:01.878 --> 11:04.141
Yeah, sorta.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.666
So don't you take the
high road with us, Pastor.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.015
I know your type.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.625
I have bedded
my share of clergy.

11:09.712 --> 11:10.800
[clicks tongue]

11:17.024 --> 11:18.808
Mary, Luke, let's go.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.332
No, I love Violet
and I'm gonna stick by her

11:21.419 --> 11:23.204
for as long as she'll have me.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.074
Get in the car.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.033
I'll call you later.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.340
CHRISTY:
Hey, Pastor?

11:29.427 --> 11:30.777
I just want you to know,

11:30.864 --> 11:31.821
we're gonna raise
the baby Jewish.

11:34.302 --> 11:37.435
And we're not Jews!

11:38.698 --> 11:41.439
Shalom, bitch!

11:48.838 --> 11:51.928
[knocking]

11:52.015 --> 11:52.842
Um, it-it's open.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.239
How ya doin'?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.154
Okay.

12:00.241 --> 12:03.853
I'm sorry about all that.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.289
I guess you can see

12:05.376 --> 12:08.640
why we don't do a lot
of entertaining.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.251
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.035
You and Grandma
were great today.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.384
You think?

12:13.471 --> 12:14.995
Yeah. For the first time
in my life

12:15.082 --> 12:16.953
I felt like we were
the normal family.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.130
Me, too! It's so weird.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.610
[sighs]

12:21.697 --> 12:23.220
So, are you in touch with Luke?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.526
No.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.962
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.834
I know what
you're going through.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.792
When I was your age,
I had a boyfriend

12:29.879 --> 12:31.751
whose parents
just hated my guts.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.362
Really?
Yeah.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.059
To be fair,
we were on pretty good terms

12:36.146 --> 12:40.324
until I got drunk and burned
their garage down.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.673
They were really judgey
about it.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.327
[giggles]

12:43.414 --> 12:44.807
Luke's parents were always
really nice to me,

12:44.894 --> 12:47.114
I mean, until today.

12:47.201 --> 12:51.596
Well, until today, you were
his high school sweetheart.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.077
Now you're his
white trash baby mama.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.994
Guess it doesn't matter anyway

12:58.081 --> 12:59.735
'cause I think
we should break up.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.911
I'm gonna tell Luke to start
dating other people.

13:01.998 --> 13:06.002
Oh, honey, are you sure
that's a good idea?

13:06.089 --> 13:09.876
I mean, he is the baby's father,

13:09.963 --> 13:12.443
and more importantly,
he thinks I'm cool.

13:12.530 --> 13:15.098
BONNIE:
Christy!

13:15.185 --> 13:17.187
Call 911!
I'm having a heart attack!

13:17.274 --> 13:21.017
No, you're not.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.977
It might be a stroke!
I smell toast!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.284
I'm here if you need me.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.633
Thanks.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.852
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

13:29.939 --> 13:32.289
Shouldn't you hurry?

13:32.376 --> 13:34.901
False alarm, just gas!

13:38.513 --> 13:40.080
There you go.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.170
A good night's sleep
gonna make all the difference.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.214
Thanks.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.826
Am I pretty?

13:49.002 --> 13:50.699
What?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.744
Yes, of course.
You're beautiful.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.182
I don't feel beautiful.

13:55.269 --> 13:59.273
I feel like a man trapped
in a man's body.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.144
Stop it.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.278
All the stuff you're
worrying about is in your head.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.583
It's not really happening.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.672
Are you saying I'm crazy?

14:07.759 --> 14:10.893
No. I mean, not in thiscontext.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.765
Is Violet mad at me?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.552
Quite the contrary,
she's actually proud of you.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.162
Really?
Yeah!

14:19.249 --> 14:21.643
She thought you were awesome
with Luke's dad.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.863
And get this, she called us
the normal family.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.387
Shut up!

14:26.474 --> 14:28.911
Yeah, that's a first.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.218
Oh. [chuckles]

14:31.305 --> 14:33.263
Okay, let's get some
shut-eye.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.396
I'm sure everything will look
better in the morning.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.050
I hope so.

14:37.137 --> 14:37.964
I'll tell you one thing
I'm not imagining.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.270
I am losing my hair.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.056
Oh, Mom, please,
don't be ridiculous.

14:43.143 --> 14:43.883
Your hair is amazing.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.798
Now go to sleep.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.201
Sweet dreams.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.295
Mom.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.862
What?

15:06.949 --> 15:08.864
Something's wrong with Grandma.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.737
You're late to the party, dude.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.919
Mom?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.095
Good morning, loved ones.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.881
See?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.928
You... feeling okay?

15:29.015 --> 15:29.929
Never better.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.539
Come, sit, enjoy.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.671
I've made scrambled eggs,
pancakes, bacon,

15:33.758 --> 15:35.499
hash browns,
toast, oatmeal.

15:35.586 --> 15:39.721
All sprinkled with a healthy
dollop of Grandmama's love.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.944
Mom, let go of his cheek.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.685
Oh, sorry, he's
just so pinchable

15:47.772 --> 15:49.992
and so, mmm, kissable

15:50.079 --> 15:52.952
and so, ooh, squeezable.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.345
Help me.

15:55.432 --> 15:58.522
Yeah, yeah-yeah,
we all love him.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.524
Come on. Sit down.

16:00.611 --> 16:04.615
Wow, this is
really quite a spread.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.227
What brought this on?

16:07.314 --> 16:09.316
Well, I woke up in
the middle of the night

16:09.403 --> 16:10.970
and realized, since I'm
clearly no longer

16:11.057 --> 16:13.668
a sexual being, I needed
to find a new identity.

16:13.755 --> 16:17.541
Okay, I get that.

16:17.628 --> 16:20.544
So...

16:20.631 --> 16:22.068
what'd you settle on?

16:22.155 --> 16:24.984
Well, isn't it obvious?

16:25.071 --> 16:26.202
I'm the mother.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.160
The-the caregiver.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.118
The nurturing crone.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.861
Who's got your nose?!

16:32.948 --> 16:34.863
Put the nose down, Mom.

16:34.950 --> 16:35.907
[knocking]

16:35.995 --> 16:37.039
I'll get it.

16:37.126 --> 16:40.434
I'm scared.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.479
You should be.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.180
Where's my son?

16:47.267 --> 16:49.138
[Southern accent]:
I haven't the faintest clue.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.707
Are you mocking me?

16:52.794 --> 16:55.101
Well, whatever do
you mean, sir?

16:55.188 --> 16:56.624
Mom, please.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.191
What's going on?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.454
Luke has disappeared.
I assumed he'd be here.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.629
Well, he's not.

17:01.716 --> 17:02.934
Would you mind checking?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.241
Sure.

17:11.030 --> 17:16.122
♪ The only one who could
ever teach me ♪

17:16.209 --> 17:18.298

17:27.959 --> 17:29.483
Violet's gone, too.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.181
Luke told me he was going
to end the relationship.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.835
She told me
the same thing.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.097
It appears
they've run off.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.751
You think?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.448
Stop!

17:44.019 --> 17:46.587
I suppose both of us
bear some responsibility

17:46.674 --> 17:47.805
for this turn of events.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.546
I don't think so.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.939
Those kids were loved and
accepted in my house!

17:51.026 --> 17:52.549
You drove them away!

17:52.636 --> 17:55.683
I was trying to keep my son
from ruining his life.

17:55.770 --> 17:59.208
Okay, do you see how
that's a little offensive

17:59.295 --> 18:00.992
when the thing ruining his
life is my daughter?!

18:01.080 --> 18:04.387
That's not what I meant.

18:04.474 --> 18:05.823
Could you help me
out here?

18:05.910 --> 18:08.957
Sorry, I'm the crazy one.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.092
Look, I'm not thrilled
about this pregnancy either,

18:13.179 --> 18:15.442
but that doesn't
really matter.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.270
All we can do
at this point

18:17.357 --> 18:19.359
is keep loving them,

18:19.446 --> 18:23.972
even though they
make it so hard!

18:24.059 --> 18:27.628
All right, perhaps I haven't
handled this very well.

18:27.715 --> 18:28.846
Haven't handled it well?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.587
You screwed the pooch, Pastor.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.765
The question is,
what are we gonna do now?

18:34.852 --> 18:37.203
What do you suggest?

18:39.118 --> 18:42.295
I suggest we come
together as adults

18:42.382 --> 18:45.385
and help these kids
who love each other

18:45.472 --> 18:47.996
do whatever the hell it is
they're gonna do!

18:49.302 --> 18:52.435
Well, I think that's very wise.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.829
Welcome to the dark side.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.138
Ooh, Virginia's alive!

VIOLET:
What kind of idiot changes
his Facebook status to single?!

19:06.623 --> 19:09.452
LUKE:
Hey, it was your idea we should
start seeing other people!

19:09.539 --> 19:11.150
That was just to trick
our parents

19:11.237 --> 19:13.326
so we could run away
to Vegas and get married!

19:13.413 --> 19:15.328
LUKE:
Well, you should've
made that clear!

19:15.415 --> 19:17.721
Well, I shouldn't have to!

19:22.204 --> 19:25.294
So, as you may have heard,
change of plans.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.436
This is nice, all of us
having dinner together.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.265
It is nice.
Mm-hmm.

[text alert sounds]

19:40.483 --> 19:42.790
Do you need to answer that?

19:42.877 --> 19:44.705
No, it's just a text from Luke.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.925
So, what's going on
with you two?

19:48.012 --> 19:49.536
He wants us
to get back together.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.580
[text alert sounds]

19:50.667 --> 19:51.973
And he loves me.

[text alert]A lot.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.498
Shouldn't you text him back?

19:55.585 --> 19:57.413
No, not yet.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.068
Let him sweat for awhile.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.417
Speaking of which,
guess who stopped sweating?

20:01.504 --> 20:04.551
The estrogen patch is helping?

20:04.638 --> 20:07.510
I am happy to report
that I'm dry

20:07.597 --> 20:08.685
in all the right places now.Good.

20:08.772 --> 20:12.123
And conversely...
Got it.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.170
How about the mood swings?

20:15.257 --> 20:18.782
Much improved, thanks
to hormone therapy.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.132
Ugh, I don't really like
these vegetables.
