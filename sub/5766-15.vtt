WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.768
No.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.290
Let me try that again.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.592
No.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.437
You're 59 cute _
when you're being emphatic.

00:08.470 --> 00:10.199
Your brow gets all...

00:10.240 --> 00:11.332
And the key word
here is "emphatic."

00:11.370 --> 00:12.473
Mom said yes.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.273
Because Mom likes to make
me the mean divorced Dad.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.436
I say no.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.141
Why?
Why do I say no?

00:17.180 --> 00:18.499
Because I do not want
some Palestinian ver5ion

00:18.550 --> 00:19.471
of yourself blowing you up.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.714
(laughs)

00:20.750 --> 00:22.581
Dad, it's a kibbutz.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.417
Unless one of
the tractors blows up,

00:24.450 --> 00:25.587
I'm going to be fine.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.757
And do you know how
hypocritical this is?

00:26.790 --> 00:30.157
You're the one who always
pushed me towards religion.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.748
Of course I know how
hypocritical this is.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.189
I'm a parent.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.492
It's my prerogative.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.191
And now I have to go
and save a campaign.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.822
Are we having dinner
on Thursday night?

00:37.870 --> 00:39.167
Unless you back out.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.236
You look happy.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.532
Are you seeing someone?

00:42.570 --> 00:43.764
Yes.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.607
My pollster.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.675
(chuckles)

00:48.510 --> 00:49.647
I'm the pollster.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.102
I'm the daughter.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.549
Good-bye.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.317
Uh, she's 18.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.612
No. I didn't say anything.

00:57.650 --> 00:59.083
Is it good?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.156
It's a silver bullet.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.750
Wendy Scott-Carr,
the untouchable candidate,

01:03.790 --> 01:05.280
just became touchable.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.548
What's her name?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.090
Natalie Flores.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.620
A student at DePaul,
in Economics.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.819
How long was she with Wendy?

01:11.870 --> 01:13.758
Five years.
Judge Adler

01:13.800 --> 01:14.892
was doing her usual vetting

01:14.940 --> 01:17.738
and Wendy Scott-Carr tried
to hide everything about her.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.773
Flores's address.

01:20.810 --> 01:24.268
Well, I'll just go and
complete the vetting.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.244
You, uh, might get to the
candidate's wife first.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.248
This hits, the press will go
right to her for comment.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.747
Alicia won't help.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.509
As long as she doesn't hurt.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.154
DIANE:
No, I don't want a debate
on it. Just fix it.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.657
And don't look to Derrick.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.123
BP is all our concern now.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.297
Get me citings by 5:00.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.627
Alicia, you sit with them.

01:40.660 --> 01:43.265
You're doing a great
job on Cowley.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.461
Okay?

01:45.500 --> 01:46.637
I just got off with her.
You got any more...

01:46.670 --> 01:47.637
DERRICK:
We've got a problem.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.308
She's on to us.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.807
I'll call back.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.671
She's on to us?
Who's on to us?

01:54.710 --> 01:57.247
The way she's dealing
with the equity partners,

01:57.280 --> 01:59.316
The way she's
isolating my people.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.544
She's gearing up for a fight.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.542
(laughing)

02:03.590 --> 02:04.887
Get the judge

02:04.920 --> 02:07.150
back on the phone.
You think I'm wrong?

02:07.190 --> 02:10.728
I think I am surrounded
by paranoid people.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.796
I calmed the waters.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.593
I stopped her defection.

02:14.630 --> 02:16.291
Diane's behaving as
any other name partner would,

02:16.330 --> 02:17.297
as you should.

02:17.330 --> 02:20.197
I think I made a mistake
firing one of my people.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.936
I lost one of my votes.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.460
I'm going to hire him back.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.808
You got to do
what you got to do.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.609
DIANE:
Look, I don't give
a damn who's wrong.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.345
Kalinda, you sit with them.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.608
Where's Blake?

02:34.650 --> 02:36.618
Uh, I heard he's out sick.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.186
Okay. You sit with them.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.687
Help them prepare questioning,

02:39.720 --> 02:43.827
because honestly, what I
give a damn about is...

02:45.460 --> 02:47.553
Is...

02:47.600 --> 02:49.625
What I give a
damn about...

02:49.670 --> 02:50.864
Uh...

02:50.900 --> 02:53.460
It's just...

02:53.500 --> 02:56.298
It's not... It's not just, uh...

02:56.340 --> 02:58.467
It's just...

02:58.510 --> 03:00.501
One minute.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.968
Hello.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.715
Hi.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.508
Been a while.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.585
Yes. Quite a while.

03:14.620 --> 03:15.757
Where have you been?

03:15.790 --> 03:16.882
Here, there.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.727
You?

03:18.760 --> 03:20.523
Here.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.892
(soft laugh)

03:22.930 --> 03:25.262
I need your help.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.734
Ms. Clinton seems to be
d0ing qUIte well for herself.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.876
Yes. So's your
girl Palin.

03:33.910 --> 03:34.934
2012, huh?

03:34.980 --> 03:36.538
That's the hope.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.445
(laughs)
Dear God.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.708
Couldn't be worse
than your man Barack.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.717
Really?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.684
I'm always astounded

03:42.720 --> 03:45.439
when a man like you expresses
such unadulterated drivel.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.754
Funny. I'm never
astounded when you do.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.354
I'm being sued for $36 million.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.259
(intercom beeps)

04:02.310 --> 04:04.369
See if Will will take my 11:00.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.308
Thank you.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.774
I'm just listening. That's all.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.539
Who's suing you?

04:09.580 --> 04:10.808
Jason Beltran.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.818
You know who that is?

04:12.850 --> 04:14.044
I do.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.877
He just had his
life sentence overturned.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.989
He did.

04:17.020 --> 04:19.557
A mistake was made at the
Cook Country Crime Lab,

04:19.590 --> 04:20.716
and that's why he was freed.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.715
I think he was freed

04:21.760 --> 04:23.557
because he was innocent,
and the cops set him up.

04:23.590 --> 04:26.798
He was freed because a crime
lab tech made a mistake.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.627
Manufactured evidence.
And misrepresented facts.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.729
Lied under oath.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.736
Anyway, I didn't
lie under oath,

04:33.770 --> 04:36.068
and I didn't
manufacture evidence.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.900
But my trial testimony supported
the lab tech's findings.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.704
Now, Mr. Beltran shot and
killed a police officer

04:42.750 --> 04:43.774
during the commission
of a bank robbery

04:43.810 --> 04:46.517
and my ballistics testimony
helped convict him.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.370
That's why he's
coming after me.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.344
Beltran says he was an
innocent bystander at the bank,

04:51.390 --> 04:53.517
and the cops came after him
because he was black.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.709
He's lying.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.853
I have to think about it.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.957
No. Kurt...

05:03.600 --> 05:05.090
Our firm benefited

05:05.130 --> 05:07.667
from this Cook County Crime Lab
malfeasance.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.339
We had two criminal
cases overturned,

05:10.370 --> 05:11.837
so I need to think about it.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.508
It's not a brush-off.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.471
You should have called me.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.819
When you got back
from your case in Florida.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.841
You're right.
I should have.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.429
I'm sorry.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.937
Hey.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.063
Bond thinks you're on to him,
so can you stop

05:42.100 --> 05:43.761
showing so much intensity

05:43.810 --> 05:46.370
in_ the staff
meetings, please?

05:46.410 --> 05:48.105
Diane?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.846
What?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.802
You look happy.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.910
I am happy. I've decided
I'm good at my job.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.747
You are good
at your job.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.087
I've always said it.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.519
What is it?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.619
We have a silver bullet.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.128
Something that will destroy
Wendy Scott-Carr,

06:04.160 --> 06:07.755
but when we fire it,
the press will come for you.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.667
And I will send them to you.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.826
No, it's not
what you're thinking.

06:11.870 --> 06:15.829
Later today, I'm meeting with
a woman named Natalie Flores

06:15.870 --> 06:19.135
who worked for five years
as Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.001
That's your silver bullet?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.974
Yes.
She had a nanny?

06:23.010 --> 06:26.002
It's never the big things
that bring politicians down.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.848
She is an illegal alien.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.711
Wendy wants
to be state's attorney,

06:30.750 --> 06:32.183
and for five years,
she broke the law.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.017
And not just any law.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.426
People do not like
iHegalaHens.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.985
And why would the press
come to me?

06:39.030 --> 06:41.498
You were a stay-at-home mom.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.896
(laughing)

06:43.930 --> 06:45.921
Isn't it great?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.062
You were June Cleaver.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.863
For 15 years,
you raised the kids,

06:48.900 --> 06:51.869
no nannies,
noiHegalaHens.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.935
You're as American
as apple pie.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.949
I'm so glad those 15
years weren't wasted.

06:56.980 --> 06:59.619
Yeah, don't say anything
like that to the press, okay?

06:59.650 --> 07:01.447
You're the good mom.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.984
My staff will send over
some brownie recipes.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.783
GRACE (on ringtone):
Hey, Mom. Pick up the phone.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.855
Hey, Mom.
Pick up the phone.

07:07.890 --> 07:09.983
Well, I have to go and do
some good mothering now.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.021
Grace.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.051
You need a what?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.692
A T-shirt.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.891
It's not my fault, Mom.
The school's fascist.

07:18.930 --> 07:21.069
They won't let me
go back to class

07:21.100 --> 07:22.533
unless I change my T-shirt.

07:25.810 --> 07:26.936
Hello?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.504
Hmm?
Tommy.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.201
Hmm.
What a surprise.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.899
Would you like
to sit down?
No, no.

07:31.950 --> 07:35.147
I'd like you to know that
Kurt McVeigh is the enemy.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.114
So imagine my surprise
when I discovered

07:37.150 --> 07:39.687
who's representing him.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.211
Your information
is premature.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.989
I haven't decided yet.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.986
Good, good.
Then let me help you out.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.590
The cops set up
Jason Beltran.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.495
They got the crime lab
to fake the evidence,

07:50.530 --> 07:51.758
and they got your
ballistics expert

07:51.800 --> 07:52.767
to change his testimony.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.960
Why are you suing, Tommy?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.797
He's free.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.501
Your client's free.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.905
To teach
the authorities a lesson.

07:58.940 --> 08:01.101
I get a big award
from McVeigh,

08:01.140 --> 08:02.801
that will scare the _
state attorney into settling.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.240
We've worked on a_ lot
of cases together, Diane.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.078
The grocer's union,
the Houston squatters.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.940
This goes against
everything you stand for.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.083
You don't know
everything I stand for.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.917
They want to use you, Diane,

08:14.960 --> 08:15.949
a known and respected liberal.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.526
They want to put a pretty face
on a racist defense.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.619
Don't you see that?

08:19.660 --> 08:21.025
You know what?

08:21.060 --> 08:24.029
Thanks for helping
me decide.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.560
I'll see you in court.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.830
Oh...

08:32.070 --> 08:33.970
You're going to lose a lot
of friends over this one.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.637
Then they weren't friends
to begin with.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.874
I'll go after you hard.

08:36.910 --> 08:38.639
Looking forward to it.
Do your worst.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.911
Good-bye.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.926
ALICIA:
I'm sorry.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.597
It's what?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.789
The saying.
It's not allowed.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.938
It's a Christian saying, right?

09:04.970 --> 09:06.130
It doesn't matter.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.138
We've restricted all
sayings on shirts.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.047
Uh, and you don't think
you'll have a problem

09:11.080 --> 09:12.047
with the First Amendment?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.217
A month ago, some kids

09:13.250 --> 09:15.878
wore pro-gay T-shirts to school.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.888
Then other kids wore
anti-gay shirts.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.854
This is not about
the First Amendment.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.017
I understand you have
some issues here, ma'am.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.984
But you don't circumvent
those issues

09:25.030 --> 09:27.225
by infringing
on my daughter's rights.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.296
You open yourself up
to a lawsuit.

09:29.330 --> 09:33.096
My firm is fighting
a case like this, and...

09:34.640 --> 09:35.868
(sobbing):
I'm...

09:35.900 --> 09:37.800
I'm sorry. I just can't.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.205
Ijust...

09:39.240 --> 09:41.936
You have no idea
how hard it is.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.845
Everyone's threatening me.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.040
Everyone's threatening to sue.

09:46.110 --> 09:47.611
You should sue.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.117
It's the First Amendment.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.287
So, are we Christians now?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.345
No. They weren't
letting Shannon wear it,

09:52.390 --> 09:53.652
so I decided
to wear it, too.

09:53.690 --> 09:54.714
(cell phone rings)

09:54.760 --> 09:55.784
Can you just go to school

09:55.820 --> 09:57.185
and get an education, please?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.652
Yes, I am on my way in.
Everything all right?

09:58.690 --> 09:59.896
But what if this were
a different time

09:59.930 --> 10:01.352
and they weren't letting kids
wear Martin Luther King shirts?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.061
I'll be right there.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.829
What Martin Luther
King shirts?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.667
Grace, honey, I know
you want a cause,

10:06.700 --> 10:08.236
but this isn't
your cause.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.828
Why not?

10:09.870 --> 10:10.962
Because Christians
are in no danger

10:11.010 --> 10:12.409
of becoming a
minority class.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.135
We'll talk. I got
to go to work.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.671
Go to school.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.311
WILL: I need you to help Diane
with this law suit.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.749
He just got dropped
by his insurance,

10:23.790 --> 10:24.848
and he's pushing
for a quick trial.

10:24.890 --> 10:25.914
My only worry

10:25.950 --> 10:28.180
is that Diane will lose
her perspective on this one.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.289
And you want me to...

10:29.320 --> 10:31.129
Keep that perspective.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.094
Okay.
How you doing?

10:33.130 --> 10:35.189
I...

10:35.230 --> 10:37.027
Never better.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.697
Good.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.828
Clearly,
the most complicated

10:43.870 --> 10:45.098
crime scene
of the year.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.170
500 rounds fired.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.940
Over 55 weapons.
A shootout that lasted

10:52.980 --> 10:55.210
three min_utes._
One police officer killed

10:55.250 --> 10:57.047
Four ban_k robbers.
Five.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.412
Four bank robbers were killed
at the crime scene,

11:00.460 --> 11:02.109
and a suspected fifth,
Jason Beltran,

11:02.160 --> 11:04.128
was arrested.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.924
I feel like I'm
being handled here.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.053
We intend to pursue
the same strategy

11:09.100 --> 11:10.419
as your
insurance company.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.062
Which was?

11:12.100 --> 11:13.260
You made a mistake.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.689
(scoffing chuckle)

11:15.740 --> 11:17.037
What mistake?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.264
Strategically,

11:18.310 --> 11:19.937
the only way we win the suit

11:19.980 --> 11:21.402
is to admit
to an honest mistake.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.839
KALINDA: They need to
prove collusion

11:22.880 --> 11:24.177
between you and
the crime lab.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.245
They need to prove

11:25.280 --> 11:26.816
that you wanted to get Beltran

11:26.850 --> 11:28.249
and... they can't.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.010
What they can do
is play off your ego.

11:31.050 --> 11:33.280
It's well known
you only take cases

11:33.320 --> 11:34.856
you believe are...

11:34.890 --> 11:36.187
true.

11:36.220 --> 11:39.018
They'll try to show
that you skewed the evidence

11:39.060 --> 11:40.459
to make the case true.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.456
Ms. Sharma,
call for you.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.865
Who is it?

11:43.900 --> 11:45.197
He won't say.
He said you'd know

11:45.230 --> 11:46.219
what it's regarding.

11:47.470 --> 11:50.007
Um, just take a number,
and I'll call back.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.929
I understand that you have
to fight the best case,

11:52.980 --> 11:55.198
not the truest case, but why...

11:55.240 --> 11:58.175
isn't my strongest defense
that there was no mistake?

11:58.210 --> 11:59.916
Because the court

11:59.950 --> 12:02.316
has determined that_Beltran
was wrongly conVIcted,

12:02.350 --> 12:03.908
and we can't refight that.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.748
That's why I need you
to swallow your pride,

12:06.790 --> 12:08.257
so we can win.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.523
I determined

12:11.560 --> 12:14.324
the direction and the
caliber of the bullet

12:14.360 --> 12:15.952
that killed Officer
Walter, that's all.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.366
I can't lie
on the stand

12:18.400 --> 12:21.289
about a mistake
that doesn't exist.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.399
It's just...

12:23.440 --> 12:25.203
Thank you.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.379
(sighs)

12:27.410 --> 12:29.947
(door closes)
Find his mistake.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.174
And if there isn't one?

12:31.210 --> 12:32.199
He supported
the lab tech--

12:32.250 --> 12:34.013
there has to be one.

12:34.050 --> 12:35.517
Will wants you on this?

12:35.550 --> 12:36.448
Yeah.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.244
Okay. Help Kalinda.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.518
He didn't want to
leave a message.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.380
He said he'd
try later.
Okay.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.320
Anything you
want to share?

12:44.360 --> 12:45.952
No.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.021
You're the mustard seed?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.994
You have a
problem with that?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.336
ELI:
Ms. Flores?
Is it time?

12:58.370 --> 12:59.974
Is it...

13:00.010 --> 13:01.978
Oh, no, uh, um,
I-I'm Mr. Gold.

13:02.010 --> 13:03.409
We talked on the phone.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.179
Victoria Adler
referred me.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.245
Oh, yeah, uh, Vicki.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.340
I just, I just have to get...
to get this trade off.

13:10.350 --> 13:11.487
The stock market?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.851
Shenzhen Exchange.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.016
It just opened.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.415
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.223
Come on, come on, come on.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.329
Yes.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.191
My senior project.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.028
I'm trying to prove that
the next great financial bubble

13:24.070 --> 13:25.264
is in pharmaceuticals.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.393
Foreign money flooding
into CDOs,

13:27.440 --> 13:31.331
based on FDA clearances
of drug studies.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.509
Don't worry, I'm a nanny, too.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.407
But if you want,

13:35.440 --> 13:36.304
I can manage your money.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.876
Oh, I...

13:37.910 --> 13:39.104
I'm joking.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.310
And...

13:42.050 --> 13:44.086
I just shorted MRG.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.886
Okay, uh, Mr. Gold,
uh, what can I do for you?

13:52.190 --> 13:55.455
Well, as I said on the phone,
I have two children.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.922
Ages...?
Six and eight.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.939
Names?
Peter... and Alicia.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.437
And you want tutoring, too?

14:01.470 --> 14:03.165
I... No.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.461
Yeah. I guess.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.307
If-if that's possible.
It would have

14:06.340 --> 14:08.035
to work around
my graduate degree.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.069
Oh, I understand.

14:09.110 --> 14:10.304
Can I ask you

14:10.350 --> 14:12.443
about your most
recent employment?
You can.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.539
I worked for
the same family

14:14.580 --> 14:16.548
for the last five years--
two daughters.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.946
Okay. And, um...

14:18.990 --> 14:20.412
(exhales)

14:20.460 --> 14:22.416
I hate to_ have to ask
you this, but, uh,

14:22.460 --> 14:24.519
you know...
Um... it's okay.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.290
Vicki said that
I could talk to you.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.390
Um, I was born
in Nayarit, Mexico.

14:30.430 --> 14:32.489
My parents came here
when I was two.

14:32.530 --> 14:35.931
But I am working
with a lawyer on my citizenship.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.359
All I've ever_
known is America.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.208
Can I have the lawyer's name,
just to check details?

14:41.240 --> 14:43.174
Sure. Um...

14:43.210 --> 14:47.146
he says it could be a year
before I get my citizenship,

14:47.180 --> 14:49.341
but, um...

14:49.380 --> 14:51.610
I will let him know
that you're calling.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.413
Give me a call,
Mr. Gold.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.280
I'm very good
with kids.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.629
Oh, I don't doubt that
for a second,

14:57.660 --> 14:59.321
Ms. Flores.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.453
Oh, and good luck
with your thesis.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.626
I did mine

15:02.660 --> 15:04.389
on the savings and
loan meltdown,

15:04.430 --> 15:06.625
a long time...
1986.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.331
You were an economics major?

15:08.370 --> 15:10.258
I was, many a moon ago.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.629
Do you miss it?

15:11.670 --> 15:14.309
Uh, economics, no, no.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.205
It's too messy for me.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.379
So, you went into...?

15:18.410 --> 15:20.571
Party planning.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.269
(laughs)

15:22.320 --> 15:23.947
I would think
that party planning

15:23.990 --> 15:25.343
could get pretty darn messy.

15:25.390 --> 15:26.482
Depends on the party.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.317
(laughs)

15:28.360 --> 15:30.453
Uh, a-anyway, I got to go.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.119
KALIN DA:
The center camera?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.569
Bank robber shot it out,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.488
so I synched up
the two outlying cameras.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.338
So, the front of
the bank is here?

15:46.710 --> 15:49.178
Oh, come on, will you two
just bury the hatchet?

15:49.210 --> 15:50.541
What hatchet?

15:50.580 --> 15:53.413
I was considering
Mrs. Florrick's fine question.

15:53.450 --> 15:56.988
Look, Childs wants me to
show you guys everything

15:57.020 --> 15:59.409
because Beltran's lawyers
are coming after us next.

15:59.450 --> 16:01.953
So, yes.

16:02.790 --> 16:04.451
Bank was here,

16:04.490 --> 16:05.980
Mrs. Florrick.

16:06.030 --> 16:07.429
It was well organized.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.121
They had assault
weapons-- they tried

16:09.160 --> 16:10.991
to make off with $800,000.

16:11.030 --> 16:12.691
Now, there's Beltran.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.177
And there's Officer Walter.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.646
12-year veteran,
father of five.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.671
Here it comes.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.515
The bullet went
through his body.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.312
McVeigh discovered
the nine-millimeter

16:35.360 --> 16:36.486
bullet fragment there

16:36.520 --> 16:37.589
on the facing wall.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.824
He determined

16:38.860 --> 16:42.057
from direction of fire that only
Beltran could have fired it.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.328
So...

16:43.370 --> 16:45.099
either you're looking
at an innocent man,

16:45.130 --> 16:47.667
or someone who just
got away with murder.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.636
Think of ballistics
as both a science and an art.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.672
See, that's what I
say to a jury first.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.339
They love it when I compare
it to something they know.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.439
You see, an artist works
with paints and brushes.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.549
A ballistics expert

17:00.580 --> 17:03.185
works with direction and metal.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.448
Bullets.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.446
_ MAN: _
You see, it's not so Simple,

17:06.490 --> 17:08.082
over 500 rounds.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.227
Most crime scenes, they are
two rounds, five rounds,

17:12.260 --> 17:13.329
what have you.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.429
Not so hard.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.597
You disagree?

17:17.630 --> 17:20.497
I just need to get some air.
No.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.269
You think I am unworthy of you.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.766
I think you have a gimmick.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.732
I think you play up
the whole...

17:26.770 --> 17:29.102
ancient Chinese wisdom thing

17:29.140 --> 17:30.277
to deflect

17:30.310 --> 17:32.198
from your lack of ability.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.717
Okay, I don't think that...

17:33.750 --> 17:36.275
My lack of ability
is willing to help you.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.641
Do you not want my help?

17:38.690 --> 17:39.782
We want your help.

17:41.590 --> 17:44.423
* Ever since I was born
people try to control me *

17:44.460 --> 17:46.849
* Sell me a bill of goods,
model and mold me *

17:46.890 --> 17:50.291
* But all I ever ended up
was lost in the shuffle... *

17:50.330 --> 17:51.592
Hey, Jimmy Patrick
back with you,

17:51.630 --> 17:54.463
with my main man,
J.T., behind the camera.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.639
We are the mustard seeds.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.160
Deal with it. Hey!

17:58.210 --> 17:59.302
Time to get real here.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.602
Because Jesus

18:00.640 --> 18:02.198
didn't come to bring peace,

18:02.240 --> 18:04.242
he came to bring a sword.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.599
Jesus says,

18:05.650 --> 18:08.141
"For I came to set a man

18:08.180 --> 18:09.374
against his father,

18:09.420 --> 18:11.718
and a daughter
against her mother.

18:11.750 --> 18:15.413
He who loves mother and father
more than me

18:15.460 --> 18:16.449
is not worthy.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.525
PEOPLE:
Amen!

18:17.560 --> 18:20.427
Last week I told you
that Jesus is

18:20.460 --> 18:22.826
(braying)
not a Republican or a Democrat,

18:22.860 --> 18:25.420
he hates global warming,

18:25.470 --> 18:27.199
he hates polluters.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.561
Jesus doesn't want you
to stay off drugs

18:29.600 --> 18:31.238
or get an "A."

18:31.270 --> 18:32.532
He could give a crap.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.673
He's the first rebel.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.429
He wants you to question
your parents.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.209
He wants you to get in the face

18:38.250 --> 18:39.569
of authority.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.612
He wants anarchy.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.738
Okay, thank you. Bye.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.610
Was that her lavwer?

18:46.650 --> 18:49.357
Natalie's lavwer, yes.
And?

18:49.390 --> 18:50.755
He's toying with her.
It's a citizenship mill.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.553
He's trying to make
money out of her.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.659
But that's good,
right? I mean,

18:53.700 --> 18:56.624
it's better for the story
if she's not a citizen.

18:56.660 --> 18:58.719
She'll be deported.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.761
Right, back to Mexico. And?

19:02.870 --> 19:04.701
You're right.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.731
Do the polling;
get it ready.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.609
(gunshot echoes)

19:17.320 --> 19:19.379
They'll put you
on the stand first,

19:19.420 --> 19:22.548
because they want
to play on your ego.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.821
They want you to
defend your findings.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.829
Just allow for doubt in your
investigations, that's all.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.919
You don't have to
say you were wrong.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.369
Just say there was

19:32.400 --> 19:35.289
an 80% probability or
something like that.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.365
I know this is hard.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.783
You want to fire it?

19:54.820 --> 19:57.527
I was a pretty good shot.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.686
Fire it.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.721
No.

20:04.730 --> 20:07.267
Why is there this
attraction to guns?

20:07.300 --> 20:09.234
(sighs)
Hmm?

20:09.270 --> 20:11.568
I don't understand it.

20:11.610 --> 20:16.479
This is an Austrian bullpup
5.56-millimeter assault rifle.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.205
Here, try.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.517
It's just so base.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.915
Now, brace it
against your shoulder.

20:24.950 --> 20:28.249
It's a two-stage trigger,
half for semi-automatic,

20:28.290 --> 20:29.882
full for automatic.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.492
(quietly):
I can't sleep with you.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.869
Okay.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.892
I'm your lavwer;
it's unethical.

20:43.540 --> 20:47.032
What's that
piece of paper?

20:47.070 --> 20:48.674
The retainer agreement.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.575
I haven't signed it.

20:50.610 --> 20:53.408
Not yet.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.839
Ms. Lockhart?

20:58.890 --> 21:00.551
The retainer?

21:00.590 --> 21:03.650
Oh. Oh,
did you sign it?

21:05.490 --> 21:06.889
Not yet.

21:17.070 --> 21:19.538
Have you ever met
my client, Mr. Jason Beltran?
No, I saw him in court,

21:19.570 --> 21:21.401
but that's about it.
At his criminal trial,

21:21.440 --> 21:23.544
the trial that's
since been overturned.
But to be accurate,

21:23.580 --> 21:25.707
I believe the verdict
was vacated,

21:25.750 --> 21:28.014
and the state's attorney
declined to reprosecute.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.314
TOMMY:
Then you don't agree with
the vacating of that sentence?

21:30.350 --> 21:31.908
No, I think that
the legal process

21:31.950 --> 21:33.986
was... probably just.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.658
Because of this woman.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.351
If that's Rosalie
Torrance, yes,

21:37.390 --> 21:39.085
I think you're right.
Then you've
never met her,

21:39.130 --> 21:41.496
The lab tech that falsified
evidence against my client.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.395
No, I talked
to her on the phone.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.591
TOMMY:
But you know that
she accidentally destroyed

21:45.630 --> 21:47.063
forensic evidence collected
at the crime scene

21:47.100 --> 21:49.398
and then later fa|_sified it
to frame my client.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.931
I do know that, and I do know
that she's being prosecuted

21:51.970 --> 21:53.062
for those falsifications.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.601
And isn't it true
that when she called you

21:55.640 --> 21:58.473
to tell you about her findings,
you changed your own findings?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.774
No.
No? So why'd you
change your findings?

22:00.820 --> 22:01.809
Objection!

22:01.850 --> 22:04.785
Huh? On what grounds?

22:04.820 --> 22:06.048
Argumentative?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.811
Because Mr. McVeigh was asked

22:08.860 --> 22:10.748
whether he changed his findings,

22:10.790 --> 22:13.350
but that has not yet
been determined by the facts.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.493
Uh-huh, I see. Sustained.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.669
TOMMY:
But you originally concluded

22:17.700 --> 22:20.999
that my client
did not fire the gun.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.769
Isn't that correct,
Mr. McVeigh?
No.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.109
I try to avoid
early conclusions.

22:25.140 --> 22:28.928
In all my investigations,
there is an element of doubt.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.642
I'm only 80%

22:31.680 --> 22:32.806
sure of anything.

22:32.850 --> 22:33.942
TOMMY:
Mr. McVeigh,

22:33.980 --> 22:35.516
are you a member
of the Tea Party?

22:35.550 --> 22:37.142
Objection, Your Honor.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.045
Your Honor, it is our contention
that my client's prosecution

22:39.090 --> 22:40.216
was racist. We believe

22:40.250 --> 22:42.787
that Mr. McVeigh's membership
in a racist organization...

22:42.820 --> 22:44.924
DIANE:
Oh, come on.
The Tea Party

22:44.960 --> 22:45.984
is racist?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.759
Let Mrs. Lockhart
argue the opp05ite.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.419
Yeah, what did I say?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.563
Mrs.
My apologies.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.864
I was confused.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.637
Your Honor?

22:58.740 --> 23:01.174
I'm thinking!

23:01.210 --> 23:04.099
Overruled.
Proceed.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.948
Is that a photo of you
at a Tea Party

23:06.980 --> 23:09.847
rally in Milwaukee
last January?

23:09.880 --> 23:11.017
Yes, it is.

23:11.050 --> 23:12.085
Would you read to us
the sign

23:12.120 --> 23:13.758
that that man is holding
next to you?

23:13.790 --> 23:16.509
Your Honor, my client
is not holding that sign,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.926
and I would contest
that he is next to him.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.054
I think, uh, the jury
can see that, Mrs. Locker.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.829
McVEIGH:
That sign?
Mm-hmm.

23:23.870 --> 23:24.996
It appears

23:25.030 --> 23:26.827
to read,
"Go back to the jungle."

23:26.870 --> 23:28.633
And that refers
to our current preSIdent?

23:28.670 --> 23:30.194
I can't say that for certain.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.764
I assume that's correct.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.163
Mm-hmm. How many
African-Americans

23:33.210 --> 23:34.632
have you
testified against,

23:34.680 --> 23:36.033
Mr. McVeigh?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.638
How many accused?

23:37.680 --> 23:39.500
Yeah.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.643
I can't speak accurately
to that.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.682
Oh. Well, I can.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.119
Eighty-nine.

23:45.150 --> 23:46.947
Would you believe that?

23:46.990 --> 23:49.083
I would believe that.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.122
And how many white accused
have you testified against?

23:51.160 --> 23:54.027
My guess is that
it would be less.

23:54.060 --> 23:56.096
It is less. 22.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.064
An even 22.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.125
So, I would guess that

24:00.170 --> 24:01.239
my client never had a chance.

24:01.270 --> 24:02.692
Objection, Your Honor!

24:06.770 --> 24:08.738
I heard you.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.975
Sustained.

24:13.050 --> 24:14.847
MA'I'I':
You need to talk

24:14.880 --> 24:16.108
to the nanny again.
Why?

24:16.150 --> 24:18.186
There's sympathy
for Wendy needing a nanny

24:18.220 --> 24:20.211
among women 18 to 49.

24:21.890 --> 24:24.552
Then we can't use it.

24:24.590 --> 24:27.024
No, we can use it,
but we need to find out

24:27.060 --> 24:29.096
if Wendy fired the nanny
because of the campaign.

24:29.130 --> 24:29.926
Voters lose sympathy

24:29.960 --> 24:32.121
if she fired her
for political reasons.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.159
See?
Mm-hmm.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.633
That's the silver bullet.

24:34.670 --> 24:35.932
It's always the same.

24:35.970 --> 24:37.904
It's not the act.
It's the cover-up.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.999
You need to go back
to the nanny

24:40.040 --> 24:42.099
and find out
why she was let go.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.040
I'll go ask.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.173
Mr. McVeigh,

24:47.210 --> 24:48.871
tell me about the Tea Party.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.842
It's a political
movement made up of

24:50.890 --> 24:54.053
conservatives and libertarians
intending to apply pressure

24:54.090 --> 24:56.081
to the government
to reduce spending.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.758
Is it racist?

24:57.790 --> 24:58.779
No.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.081
Are there racists

25:00.130 --> 25:01.529
and extremists
within it?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.289
Yes.
Are there racists

25:03.330 --> 25:05.798
_ _ and extremists
Within the Democratic Party?

25:05.830 --> 25:07.127
Objection. Relevance.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.296
I'm sorry. What?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.659
TOMMY:
The question of whether

25:09.700 --> 25:10.837
there are racists
in the Democratic Party

25:10.870 --> 25:12.701
is not relevant, Your Honor.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.708
Sustained.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.708
But I, uh...

25:16.740 --> 25:20.176
Yeah, okay, go ahead.

25:20.210 --> 25:23.611
Why do you belong
to the Tea Party?

25:23.650 --> 25:24.981
I think the government

25:25.020 --> 25:27.682
is encroaching too
much into my life.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.881
Isn't the Tea Party
primarily anti-Obama?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.785
McVNEIGH:
0.
Then why wasn't it formed

25:31.830 --> 25:33.024
under George W. Bush?

25:34.060 --> 25:36.028
There was hope

25:36.060 --> 25:38.267
that President Bush
would cut spending.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.892
Really?

25:40.940 --> 25:42.896
I would acknowledge

25:42.940 --> 25:45.306
that it was a slim hope
and a thwarted hope,

25:45.340 --> 25:47.228
but the Tea Party
is not about Obama.

25:47.270 --> 25:49.909
It's about putting pressure
on both parties to reduce.

25:49.940 --> 25:52.704
Because we're being bankrupted?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.149
Yes.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.171
That's all, Your Honor.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.587
Well, I think
that worked.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.078
I mean, it was painful,
but it worked.

26:04.260 --> 26:05.784
What's wrong?

26:12.330 --> 26:14.298
(knocking on door)

26:14.340 --> 26:15.830
Go away!

26:18.140 --> 26:20.165
But she hasn't
lost perspective?

26:20.210 --> 26:22.770
No. She's fighting harder.

26:22.810 --> 26:25.244
Unfortunately, I need her to
fight harder at work, too.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.816
(sighs)

26:35.120 --> 26:37.281
Why do you hate Jesus?

26:37.320 --> 26:39.288
I don't hate Jesus.

26:39.330 --> 26:43.027
I think Jesus is someone
who lived 2,000 years ago

26:43.060 --> 26:45.199
and has very little
to do with me.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.228
I think you either hate Jesus,
or you love him.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.101
I don't think there's
an in between.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.664
And why do
you need wine

26:52.710 --> 26:53.972
to discuss this?

26:55.010 --> 26:56.978
I don't need wine.

26:57.010 --> 26:59.046
I like wine.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.412
I like a glass of wine
after work.

27:01.450 --> 27:02.712
But you talk to me

27:02.750 --> 27:04.183
all the time about drugs.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.778
Wine is a drug.

27:10.390 --> 27:11.982
Very adult.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.281
Yup.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.354
Over 21, that's me.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.389
You treat me like a kid.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.091
You are a kid.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.028
I'm not thinking like a kid.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.288
So you're a mustard seed?

27:22.200 --> 27:25.203
I think Jesus is someone
I want to know more about.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.731
I think science isn't taking
prayer seriously enough.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.077
I think global
warming's real.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.203
And I don't think
believing in Jesus means

27:31.250 --> 27:32.706
believing global warming
doesn't exist.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.953
Just taking another hit
off the crack pipe.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.754
I liked it more
when you didn't work.

27:43.790 --> 27:45.223
Okay, that's enough.

27:45.260 --> 27:46.818
I'm not not going to work.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.122
What is this about-- Shannon?

27:48.160 --> 27:50.196
Why does this have to be
about Shannon?

27:50.230 --> 27:51.891
I'm a thinking person.

27:51.930 --> 27:55.058
I'm thinking about Jesus, okay?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.738
So, you're becoming a Christian?

27:56.770 --> 27:58.067
No.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.465
I don't know.

28:00.510 --> 28:03.331
I just don't like the
way that you smirk at it.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.769
I don't think I do smirk at it.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.277
I just can't figure out

28:07.310 --> 28:10.074
when one cause begins with you
and another ends.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.485
Jesus is not a cause.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.408
He's the source of causes.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.418
Okay.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.916
You're rebelling.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.019
That's what this is about.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.425
So, when you can figure out

28:20.460 --> 28:22.394
what it is you believe in,

28:22.430 --> 28:25.194
let me know,
and we'll talk, okay?

28:25.230 --> 28:27.391
Well, Jesus was
the first rebel.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.399
Well, then, maybe Jesus
can pay the rent every month.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.362
Consider the lilies
of the field.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.731
They neither toil...
(door closes)

28:37.950 --> 28:39.042
(phone ringing)

28:39.080 --> 28:40.502
Yeah?

28:40.550 --> 28:42.518
CARY:
All right, so,
you're not gonna like this.

28:42.550 --> 28:44.939
A month before
the back robbery shootout,

28:44.990 --> 28:47.754
there was this attempted
suicide-by-cop.

28:47.790 --> 28:50.384
A bank customer took a shot
at a cop

28:50.420 --> 28:52.854
to try and get the cop
to kill him.

28:52.890 --> 28:54.391
(knocks)
Uh, hang on, Cary.

28:54.430 --> 28:56.250
That_man-- he's
calling again.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.393
Tell him this.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.467
If he leaves me a number,
I'll call him back.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.434
And if he doesn't
leave me a number,

29:03.470 --> 29:04.937
then I won't call him back.

29:05.970 --> 29:08.131
Yeah.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.069
The cop didn't return fire.
That's why he didn't report it.

29:11.110 --> 29:13.476
I only found out about it
when something seemed weird

29:13.510 --> 29:15.512
about this nine millimeter
shell fragment.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.245
McVeigh included
this nine millimeter

29:17.280 --> 29:18.417
shell fragment in his analysis.

29:18.450 --> 29:19.519
He thought it was part
of the bullet

29:19.550 --> 29:20.881
that went through the officer.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.080
So he screwed up?

29:22.120 --> 29:23.348
Yeah.

29:23.390 --> 29:25.858
Now, on the bright side,
it wasn't his screwup.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.529
He was never told of this
attempted suicide-by-cop.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.926
Thanks, but I don't think
this is a guy

29:30.970 --> 29:32.426
who can deal with a bright side.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.335
See you.

29:34.370 --> 29:36.361
His number.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.508
Hey.

29:47.610 --> 29:50.408
We found your mistake.

29:50.450 --> 29:53.419
The nine millimeter
fragment you found

29:53.450 --> 29:56.089
was from an earlier crime.

30:05.130 --> 30:08.839
So, what are we
shorting today?

30:08.870 --> 30:11.259
A new biomed IPO
out of Boston.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.062
I want to talk to you.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.578
And I have a few
questions for you, too.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.548
Natalie!

30:27.220 --> 30:29.484
Is everything okay?

30:29.520 --> 30:32.557
What are you really after?

30:32.590 --> 30:33.898
What am I...?

30:33.930 --> 30:35.557
You don't
want a nanny.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.421
Why would you say that?

30:38.470 --> 30:40.859
You called my lavwer,
and you scared him.

30:40.900 --> 30:44.961
He says now he's serious about
working on my citizenship.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.932
I thought he was
serious before.

30:46.970 --> 30:51.077
He says, now it's
gonna take two months.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.271
Not a year.
I felt he was cheating you.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.143
When I called him,
and I told him that he should

30:56.180 --> 30:57.909
not cheat you, and I told him

30:57.950 --> 31:00.009
that he should not
tell you I called.

31:00.050 --> 31:03.258
Yes, well, he doesn't
seem quite trustworthy.

31:03.290 --> 31:07.522
So... what is it
you want from me?

31:07.560 --> 31:10.028
I don't know.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.163
I have a boyfriend.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.033
Or I had a boyfriend.

31:16.070 --> 31:17.162
He joined a circus.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.431
A Cirque du
Soleil circus.

31:20.470 --> 31:21.676
He's a contortionist.

31:21.710 --> 31:22.529
(laughs)

31:22.580 --> 31:26.175
He's a French-Canadian
contortionist.

31:26.210 --> 31:27.438
(laughs)

31:27.480 --> 31:30.347
He gets very angry
when I laugh at him.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.587
But, um...

31:32.620 --> 31:34.588
thank you for helping me,

31:34.620 --> 31:36.656
but I...

31:36.690 --> 31:38.521
You know, I'm in a very
precarious position,

31:38.560 --> 31:39.925
and I can't...
(phone ringing)

31:39.960 --> 31:42.099
No, no, no. I-I don't...

31:42.130 --> 31:44.667
Would you wait just one moment?

31:44.700 --> 31:46.395
Hello?

31:46.430 --> 31:48.193
Oh, yeah?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.265
Yeah. Uh, no, no,
don't worry.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.133
Next time. Okay.

31:53.170 --> 31:54.637
You have to go?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.705
No, no. I-I...

31:56.740 --> 31:59.049
Someone's canceling
dinner plans.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.638
Look, I get it.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.979
Uh, you have a boyfriend,
and I am much older than you.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.181
And I have

32:06.220 --> 32:09.553
a dinner reservation
that I really should cancel.

32:09.590 --> 32:13.720
And I know I can't...

32:13.760 --> 32:15.455
I'm sorry.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.024
That was me trying to do
a contortionist thing.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.115
(phone ringing)

32:34.150 --> 32:35.344
Yup.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.473
KALINDA:
It's a downloaded file, right?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.317
The DVD you made
for the Beltran case?

32:39.350 --> 32:40.749
The DVD the cops gave
to McVeigh--

32:40.790 --> 32:42.212
it's from a digital file.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.478
Uh... yeah, I guess. Why?

32:44.530 --> 32:47.988
Can you get me the original
analogue surveillance footage?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.495
It's late, Kalinda.

32:50.530 --> 32:51.428
Why would I do that?

32:51.470 --> 32:55.190
Because a compressed file
drops frames,

32:55.240 --> 32:57.458
and I need to see every frame.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.762
Thank you for coming.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.368
Why wouldn't I?

33:00.410 --> 33:02.002
You're young.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.179
(chuckles)

33:04.210 --> 33:05.438
Yep.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.742
The future.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.577
I want to understand the young.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.678
(laughs)

33:09.720 --> 33:11.608
You talk like a newspaper.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.481
Oh, and that's the worst
thing to be, right?

33:13.520 --> 33:14.657
Someone who talks
like a newspaper?

33:14.690 --> 33:15.782
Well, it's not good.

33:15.820 --> 33:16.787
MARISSA:
Hello, there.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.721
Well, hello, Marissa.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.320
I thought you
couldn't make it.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.396
Change of plans, Dad.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.421
How are you?

33:26.470 --> 33:28.563
I'm Natalie.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.760
Hi, Natalie.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.767
Hi.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.270
So, you're the reason
my dad sounds so happy.

33:34.310 --> 33:35.334
Marissa...

33:35.380 --> 33:37.439
Yeah, I guess I am.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.038
And how old are you?

33:39.080 --> 33:41.469
(laughs)
I'm young.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.545
I'm, oh, so young.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.047
And how old are you?

33:45.090 --> 33:48.753
I am so going to Israel.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.283
Do you want to join us?
We could get another chair.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.696
Oh, no.
I'll let you two eat in peace.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.618
Love you, Dad.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.127
Don't forget protection.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.196
(groans)

34:04.270 --> 34:05.669
Well, wasn't that fun?

34:05.710 --> 34:08.702
Yep.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.447
So is—is that
your Six-year-old?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.242
Sorry.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.748
No. I Googled you

34:18.790 --> 34:20.439
after you left.

34:20.490 --> 34:23.584
You work
for Peter Florrick.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.726
And my old boss
is Wendy Scott-Carr,

34:26.760 --> 34:29.854
and your questions
about me being a nanny?

34:29.900 --> 34:32.198
Those are for this campaign.

34:32.230 --> 34:35.290
Not party planning.

34:35.340 --> 34:38.400
Yes.

34:38.440 --> 34:42.103
What I don't understand is,

34:42.140 --> 34:46.679
why would you pressure
my lavwer into helping me

34:46.710 --> 34:49.747
if the whole point
was to expose me?

34:53.250 --> 34:54.888
Because I'm a hypocrite.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.388
It would have been nice

34:57.420 --> 34:59.422
if you were a party planner.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.748
I really liked
the idea of that.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.160
You don't have to go.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.387
All right.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.819
So that's the original.

35:26.850 --> 35:29.751
What are you looking for?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.291
What?

35:47.310 --> 35:49.369
There.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.604
DIANE:
A ricochet.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.947
How did I miss it?

35:53.980 --> 35:57.245
The police gave you a copy
of the surveillance tape

35:57.280 --> 35:59.282
from a compressed file.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.811
A truck was passing
behind the police officer

36:01.860 --> 36:03.680
and a ricochet is visible.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.449
You had the right
conclusion,

36:05.490 --> 36:06.787
but the wrong bullet.

36:06.830 --> 36:08.195
A ricochet to where?

36:08.230 --> 36:09.891
I don't know.

36:09.930 --> 36:11.818
I thought you
could find out.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.896
When this is over,
let's go away.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.966
Away? What? To where?

36:21.010 --> 36:22.875
Costa Rica.

36:22.910 --> 36:24.502
I like it.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.676
(chuckles)

36:25.710 --> 36:27.405
No, I can't do that.

36:27.450 --> 36:28.474
You can.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.613
Well, no. I mean, not now.

36:30.650 --> 36:31.878
I have a fight at work.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.319
I can't give up on it.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.784
If we don't do it now,
we never will.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.685
And...

36:37.720 --> 36:39.779
what would we do?

36:39.830 --> 36:41.559
Make a life.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.192
Put our lives first.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.929
Was that a proposal?

36:47.970 --> 36:51.406
I would like to go away
for a while with you.

36:52.470 --> 36:55.303
If it sounds better
as a proposal,

36:55.340 --> 36:57.433
then it's a proposal.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.619
That is a gunshot.

37:09.660 --> 37:13.619
It distorts all sound around it.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.628
Now imagine 500.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.868
And then this is
what is surprising.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.460
Through all that...

37:21.500 --> 37:24.799
Your Honor, may I see
the new evidence?

37:24.840 --> 37:28.469
Of course.
Uh, Sheriff?

37:31.080 --> 37:34.516
Through all that,
Mr. McVeigh could determine

37:34.550 --> 37:37.348
the entry wound
was nine millimeters.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.019
ALICIA:
You're holding the bullet that
was just discovered yesterday?

37:40.050 --> 37:41.017
Yes.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.483
Nine millimeters.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.956
It ricocheted
off passing truck.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.719
And where was it discovered?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.057
In drywall.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.692
Covered in new plaster.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.960
And this bullet was determined

37:53.000 --> 37:55.389
to have been fired _from
Mr. Beltran's p05ition?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.737
Yes.

37:56.770 --> 37:59.705
Only direction
it could be fired from.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.038
Excuse my accent.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.570
When I get passionate,

38:03.610 --> 38:06.340
my accent comes out more.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.371
(soft chuckling)

38:12.820 --> 38:14.811
No. You drop the case.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.919
That won't happen.
It will happen.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.484
Your client's luclq
he's not back in prison.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.622
It's not luck.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.651
It's the Bill of Rights.
Double jeopardy.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.055
And so he should count himself
luclq and go home and watch TV.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.625
Because he pushes this trial,
he's not only going to lose,

38:26.670 --> 38:28.490
he's going to have the police
making his life hell.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.065
You want to say that again
so I can get that on tape?

38:31.100 --> 38:31.964
No, I want to say it again

38:32.010 --> 38:33.807
so you can understand
my words. You lost.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.434
Huh.
Beltran is guilty
and he's not going

38:36.480 --> 38:37.504
to make any money from this,

38:37.540 --> 38:38.746
because I will make it
my life's work

38:38.780 --> 38:40.475
to keep him from
making money from this.

38:40.510 --> 38:41.841
Do you understand me?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.768
This is not the Diane I know.

38:43.820 --> 38:44.980
You're right about that.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.681
Nice to meet you.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.521
(people talking indistinctly)

39:03.000 --> 39:05.662
(whistles and applause
from other room)

39:08.540 --> 39:10.132
It's out.
I see that.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.033
It's even better.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.707
She took a friend's
Social Security number

39:12.750 --> 39:13.876
to get into school.

39:13.910 --> 39:16.117
Wendy might have
helped her.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.744
MAN (in other room):
That is awesome.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.052
It was the right thing
to do, Eli.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.552
I'll go crack open
the champagne.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.020
(whistling and cheering
in other room)

39:33.070 --> 39:34.799
REPORTER:
A hobbled Wendy Scott-Carr

39:34.840 --> 39:37.695
can clearly revive
the lagging campaign prospects

39:37.740 --> 39:40.038
of ex-state's attorney
Peter Florrick.

39:40.070 --> 39:41.879
The once incorruptible image
of the populist saint

39:41.910 --> 39:44.174
hell-bent on cleaning
has given way...

39:44.210 --> 39:46.007
What do you want?

39:46.050 --> 39:48.177
What do you mean?

39:48.210 --> 39:50.144
Religion--
what do you want from me?

39:53.050 --> 39:55.814
Um, you and Dad
don't go to church.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.054
I don't go to church.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.479
Dad has Pastor Isaiah.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.623
Yeah, but I want
to go to church.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.493
Okay. Which one?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.129
Um, I don't know.

40:08.170 --> 40:11.435
I want to help you here, Grace,

40:11.470 --> 40:14.803
but this is a new area for me.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.707
And I don't know
why it makes me uncomfortable,

40:17.740 --> 40:20.903
but it makes me uncomfortable.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.577
It's because_
of your generation.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.118
Okay. Maybe.

40:28.150 --> 40:31.119
Do you want me to drive you
to church on Sunday?

40:32.160 --> 40:34.128
Okay.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.491
Sure.

40:35.530 --> 40:36.724
Okay.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.228
You pick a church,
and I will take you.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.726
And here.

40:40.770 --> 40:43.159
I thought if you were going
to be serious about it,

40:43.200 --> 40:44.861
you should read up.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.798
I'm going to bed.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.831
After I score some crack.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.576
(chuckles)

40:58.120 --> 40:59.940
Are you sure?

40:59.990 --> 41:01.582
Yes.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.508
I can't leave here now.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.187
Then you'll never leave here.

41:05.230 --> 41:08.051
Maybe.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.695
But I made that decision
a long time ago.

41:10.730 --> 41:12.823
Come on.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.861
Let's go.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.475
Then I have to go.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.241
Kurt.

41:41.860 --> 41:43.828
Palin 2012.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.862
(chuckling)

41:54.980 --> 41:56.971
You're my hero.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.181
(talking indistinctly)

42:15.600 --> 42:17.329
We need all
the equity partners there.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.828
Everybody on the same page.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.338
Mm-hmm.

42:22.370 --> 42:24.065
Hello, Diane.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.261
Derrick.

42:26.310 --> 42:29.302
We were talking about the equity
partners getting together.

42:29.340 --> 42:31.274
Nothing important.

42:31.310 --> 42:32.675
Just the usual
house-cleaning.

42:32.710 --> 42:34.575
Good. I think
that's a good idea.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.269
Then next week?

42:36.320 --> 42:38.117
You all right with next week?

42:38.150 --> 42:40.345
I am. I'm here.

42:40.390 --> 42:42.255
Good.

42:42.290 --> 42:45.225
Then I'll send out notices.

42:45.260 --> 42:46.852
We'll go over the financials,
new clients,

42:46.890 --> 42:48.255
discuss the general direction...
