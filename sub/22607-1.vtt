The burden of governance is ours,

25:03.752 --> 25:06.588
so you are free of it.

25:06.589 --> 25:09.540
You will address your Pharaoh
properly, General Horemheb,

25:09.541 --> 25:13.211
and your thousand troops moving
to the village of El Hiba

25:13.212 --> 25:17.382
will not move or engage
without my permission,

25:17.383 --> 25:19.613
nor the remainder of your 5,000 men

25:19.614 --> 25:21.669
who wait outside Memphis.

25:21.670 --> 25:26.190
I'm sorry, you've been
misinformed, My King.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.476
Tell me, who deceived you?

25:28.477 --> 25:30.694
You, General.

25:34.049 --> 25:38.177
It is no secret that you
covet the opportunity

25:38.178 --> 25:41.956
to conquer the Mitanni lands
and the lands beyond that.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.059
If it were up to you, you
would seek an endless war

25:45.060 --> 25:47.261
where the Egyptian empire stretched

25:47.262 --> 25:49.597
from horizon to horizon.

25:49.598 --> 25:51.866
My Lord, the General has yet to finalize

25:51.867 --> 25:53.868
any plans to deal with the Mitanni.

25:53.869 --> 25:55.470
The General does not have the authority

25:55.471 --> 25:56.971
to wage war as he pleases.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.705
The Vizier and I agree.

25:58.706 --> 26:03.444
Neither does the Vizier.

26:03.445 --> 26:06.200
With all due respect, we are already...

26:06.201 --> 26:09.217
At war. Yes.

26:09.218 --> 26:12.086
Amurru is not peaceful.

26:12.087 --> 26:15.238
The Mitanni have already encroached.

26:15.592 --> 26:17.392
They pillage our villages
near the borderlands.

26:17.393 --> 26:21.063
They... they rape our women.
They take our children.

26:21.064 --> 26:23.482
And now they send their spies
to the gates of Thebes.

26:23.483 --> 26:26.235
This kingdom is on the
verge of being overrun!

26:26.236 --> 26:28.371
Why wasn't this dealt with sooner?

26:28.372 --> 26:30.339
The Mitanni are crafty.

26:30.340 --> 26:34.709
No, General, they are not.

26:37.748 --> 26:39.482
And so now...

26:39.483 --> 26:41.684
now we have panic.

26:41.685 --> 26:46.289
The people have been made
fearful and desperate.

26:46.290 --> 26:47.690
They need a savior.

26:47.691 --> 26:50.292
They crave a hero,

26:50.293 --> 26:52.595
and they will worship the man
who can bring them to victory,

26:52.596 --> 26:54.363
a man who would then have cause

26:54.364 --> 26:56.265
to march to the ends of the Earth.

26:56.266 --> 26:59.535
I serve only the greater good of Egypt.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.403
No, General, you serve me.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.276
You have positioned your men well.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.079
The time to attack is now.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.015
But we will expel the Mitanni
from our borderlands,

27:13.016 --> 27:14.572
nothing more.

27:14.573 --> 27:18.596
A protracted war could draw
other nations to their cause.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.924
Continue with your preparations.

27:40.255 --> 27:43.223
It doesn't matter who strikes
first, but who strikes last.

27:43.224 --> 27:46.126
You're too predictable. You don't listen.

27:46.127 --> 27:48.795
Man against man is no different
than army against army.

27:51.166 --> 27:53.133
Deception is key.

27:53.134 --> 27:54.902
You're impatient with me today, Ka.

27:54.903 --> 27:57.538
You might as well have accused
General Horemheb of treason.

27:57.539 --> 28:00.708
He's the greatest general
Egypt has ever known.

28:00.709 --> 28:02.609
Is that how you earn the army's trust?

28:02.610 --> 28:04.011
No.

28:04.012 --> 28:06.213
I do so on the battlefield
with you by my side.

28:06.214 --> 28:07.815
You steal his glory.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.882
I claim what is rightfully mine.

28:11.319 --> 28:13.386
Do you claim what is mine as well?

28:21.730 --> 28:24.897
You're right. Deception is key.

28:26.434 --> 28:28.502
Free her from your heart,

28:28.503 --> 28:30.737
so the gods will grant
me an heir that lives.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.918
You no longer need my lessons.

28:45.887 --> 28:48.255
You've been away.

28:48.256 --> 28:50.791
To Edfu.

28:50.792 --> 28:52.359
Without telling me.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.562
You mean without your permission.

28:55.563 --> 28:59.199
You don't control me. I'm not the Pharaoh.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.701
It's only because I worry.

29:00.702 --> 29:02.369
You're still young to travel alone.

29:02.370 --> 29:05.873
I'm not a child anymore, Father.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.542
Besides, I brought two guards.

29:10.578 --> 29:11.879
You're sick.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.748
It's just a cough from the desert.

29:14.749 --> 29:16.583
You're the one that looks weary.

29:16.584 --> 29:18.886
From many things.

29:18.887 --> 29:22.055
The Pharaoh?

29:22.056 --> 29:24.525
Palace is full of quiet whispers

29:24.526 --> 29:28.112
saying that he resists your counsel.

29:28.113 --> 29:29.629
He'll learn.

29:31.533 --> 29:35.369
And one day there will be a new dynasty,

29:35.370 --> 29:36.637
new blood on the throne.

29:36.638 --> 29:39.272
Except I'm not your blood.

29:42.110 --> 29:45.245
That doesn't matter.

29:45.246 --> 29:46.859
As I promised your mother

29:46.860 --> 29:49.616
before she passed from this world,

29:49.617 --> 29:53.620
a promise I've kept.

29:53.621 --> 29:56.757
Along with other promises that you haven't.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.526
The gods dictate these things.

29:59.527 --> 30:03.130
They will speak, and we
will follow their commands.

30:03.131 --> 30:06.833
Until then, we are loyal servants.

30:18.346 --> 30:21.114
The General is a man of battle.

30:21.115 --> 30:23.717
He has no tolerance for politics,

30:23.718 --> 30:26.787
no desire for the throne.

30:26.788 --> 30:30.324
His desire is to conquer
the civilized world.

30:30.325 --> 30:34.160
Putting himself on the throne
ensures him that opportunity.

30:37.131 --> 30:39.666
He cannot easily be removed.

30:39.667 --> 30:42.803
The army's first allegiance is to him.

30:42.804 --> 30:46.340
To them, you're just a name, a cipher.

30:46.341 --> 30:50.043
You need to be prudent, find
ways to earn their trust.

30:50.044 --> 30:52.712
Which I intend to do.

30:55.717 --> 30:57.650
I will not allow it.

31:00.655 --> 31:03.824
The General is indispensable.
I understand that.

31:03.825 --> 31:08.695
But if he's the one to defeat the Mitanni,

31:08.696 --> 31:10.998
he'll be worshipped as a god,

31:10.999 --> 31:13.066
and then...

31:13.067 --> 31:16.169
then he will make his move.

31:16.170 --> 31:19.039
See, I have no choice.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.075
You're not ready to lead
these men into battle.

31:22.076 --> 31:25.112
A Pharaoh who does not
lead his men into battle

31:25.113 --> 31:28.448
is at the mercy of his generals.

31:28.449 --> 31:31.184
A Pharaoh who risks his own blood, who...

31:31.185 --> 31:33.754
Who inspires by his very presence,

31:33.755 --> 31:36.405
cannot be separated from his people.

31:55.877 --> 31:58.045
You sent for me.

III was crowned as a child

33:32.807 --> 33:34.641
like myself.

33:34.642 --> 33:39.646
His rule was peaceful, prosperous.

33:39.647 --> 33:42.816

33:47.155 --> 33:50.824

No, My Lord.

56:46.318 --> 56:49.119
It was Tutankhamun who
helped lead us to victory.

He is as much the victor
as myself or Horemheb.

but this is our fate.

fate is not what you are
given, it's what you take.

57:26.224 --> 57:28.859

57:45.877 --> 57:48.244
Come, Cousin.

57:55.820 --> 57:58.389
The Queen must marry...

57:58.390 --> 58:01.425
to keep her family's dynasty intact,

58:01.426 --> 58:04.428
and she will fall openly for Ka.

58:04.429 --> 58:06.897
His ear will belong to the General,

58:06.898 --> 58:09.667
who shows nothing but
contempt for the priests.

58:09.668 --> 58:13.170
He's a threat to everyone
who now holds power.

58:13.171 --> 58:15.406
He's a threat to all of Egypt.

58:15.407 --> 58:18.475
His military ambitions are no secret.

58:18.476 --> 58:21.679
Your ambitions are no
secret either, Vizier.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.582
Only in circumstance.

58:24.583 --> 58:26.150
I'm a servant of Egypt.

58:26.151 --> 58:29.553

58:29.554 --> 58:33.123
They control all things.
They speak through me.

58:33.124 --> 58:35.159
They will give blessing to your position

58:35.160 --> 58:39.630
if I am to retain mine
without interference.

58:39.631 --> 58:41.432
As agreed.

58:41.433 --> 58:44.602
Then proceed cautiously.

58:44.603 --> 58:46.836
Do not overwhelm her.

59:10.362 --> 59:12.763
Tell me...

59:12.764 --> 59:16.800
how long have you coveted being Pharaoh?

59:16.801 --> 59:18.214
I've never wished it.

59:20.805 --> 59:24.340
I am a loyal servant to
this palace, nothing more.

59:27.479 --> 59:31.482
You're a man of internal frustration,

59:31.483 --> 59:34.318
born of common blood,

59:34.319 --> 59:38.055
who's all but ruled the kingdom...

59:38.056 --> 59:39.890
yet forced to remain in the shadows

59:39.891 --> 59:43.227
while sons are born.

59:43.228 --> 59:46.196
Except now there is no heir.

59:46.197 --> 59:49.732
Instead there's opportunity.

59:51.536 --> 59:54.004
This...

59:54.005 --> 59:57.141
opportunity...

59:57.142 --> 59:59.009
would secure your position as well

59:59.010 --> 01:00:00.977
before others take it from us both.

01:00:03.048 --> 01:00:06.183
I wouldn't claim your heart, my lady.

01:00:06.184 --> 01:00:08.185
I know it belongs to another,

01:00:08.186 --> 01:00:12.956
one you've been denied these many years.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:16.592
How considerate of you.

01:00:37.415 --> 01:00:40.750
I haven't yet buried my first husband, Ay.

01:00:42.454 --> 01:00:45.927
Give me time before I decide on my next.

01:01:20.414 --> 01:01:24.030
Please. Here!

01:01:31.893 --> 01:01:33.300

I cannot... I cannot be found.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.282
He's no longer breathing.

01:02:04.019 --> 01:02:05.687
These dead are Mitanni.

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:08.389
We're looking for an Egyptian soldier.

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.691
I've seen no Egyptians here.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:24.032
You'll be safe here.

It's you.

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:48.756
Rest.

01:03:48.757 --> 01:03:52.126
I can't be in your village.

01:03:52.127 --> 01:03:54.262
They will be looking for me.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.165
We're not in the village.
No one will find you here.

You're just a soldier.

Thebes. I must return to Thebes.

You will do as I say.

01:04:25.627 --> 01:04:28.262
Why didn't you bring me
these seeds yourself?

01:04:30.332 --> 01:04:33.433
Well, the war is an
inconvenience for some things.

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:50.351
What is this?

01:04:50.352 --> 01:04:54.654
It's to soothe your mind,
help you heal faster.

01:04:55.991 --> 01:04:58.325
Thank you.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.503
What is your name?

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:11.672
Suhad.

01:05:11.673 --> 01:05:13.474
Suhad...

01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:15.810
that's not an Egyptian name.

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:18.146
It's Mitanni.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:19.947
But you're not Mitanni.

01:05:19.948 --> 01:05:22.483
My grandmother was,

01:05:22.484 --> 01:05:25.553
and she was raped by an Egyptian invader.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.755
So, in the eyes of the Pharaoh,

01:05:27.756 --> 01:05:30.591
I wouldn't be considered
a true Egyptian either.

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:34.061
You are an Egyptian as long as
you are loyal to the Pharaoh.

01:05:34.062 --> 01:05:37.465
My allegiance is to my family

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:41.035
and to my people here.

01:05:41.036 --> 01:05:44.405
Pharaoh, who sits on a throne
far across the desert,

01:05:44.406 --> 01:05:46.874
is of no more consequence
to me than I am to him.

01:05:48.343 --> 01:05:50.745
The Pharaoh might have your
tongue cut out for that.

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.580
From what I've heard of our Pharaoh,

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.248
he wouldn't know what to do
with my tongue if he had it.

01:06:00.522 --> 01:06:02.055
I'll get you some water.

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:21.908
You've been at prayer since
you and Ka returned.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:30.218
You've never been a devoted
man of the temple, General.

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:33.888
I am pleased.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.457
I'm here to seek clarity.

01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:39.560
Clarity?

01:06:39.561 --> 01:06:44.282
Or forgiveness?

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:46.801
Being unable to find your Pharaoh's body

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:51.105
must ravage you with guilt.

01:06:51.106 --> 01:06:54.408
I, too, hoped for clarity

01:06:54.409 --> 01:06:56.577
on your return,

01:06:56.578 --> 01:06:58.079
but you didn't witness the man

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.848
whose blade took Pharaoh's breath, did you?

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:05.485
Such a man would be a fool, High Priest.

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:14.095
To use one's own blade against the Pharaoh

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:17.148
would only bring the wrath of Osiris

01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:20.146
and an eternity of
darkness in the afterlife.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:25.339
Yes.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:30.144
But even with a clean blade,
such a man might still have

01:07:30.145 --> 01:07:34.027
the stain of Pharaoh's blood on his hands.

01:07:54.494 --> 01:07:56.328
I know what you want.

01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:58.597
And I know where your heart lies,

01:07:58.598 --> 01:08:01.600
but we cannot risk so much change.

01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:03.769
If Ka is placed in power,

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.971
it is the General who
will rule this country.

01:08:14.414 --> 01:08:17.383
When I was a little girl,

01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:19.430
I wanted to believe that marriage was more

01:08:19.432 --> 01:08:22.087
than just an arrangement of convenience.

01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:25.122
Survival, My Queen.

01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:39.939
Vizier.

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:42.774
Tell me when you saw her differently,

01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:45.676
the first time you looked on her
in a way you hadn't before.

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:51.216
As long as I can remember.

01:08:51.218 --> 01:08:53.786
When did you see her differently?

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:58.124
When did you see her as
your last opportunity?

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:01.861
Your father was a hero to Akhenaten.

01:09:01.862 --> 01:09:04.162
He bled and died for him,

01:09:04.163 --> 01:09:06.599
which is why you were
brought into this palace,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.102
raised as a brother, as a son.

01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:13.706
Which is why you'll be a loyal
servant when I'm Pharaoh.

01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:15.707
The General is not your friend, Ka.

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:19.645
- Neither are you.
- No, but I am hers.

01:09:19.645 --> 01:09:23.916
She had a brother, Vizier.
She had a friend.

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:26.004
Doesn't she deserve more than that?

01:09:54.714 --> 01:09:57.351
What is this?

01:09:57.352 --> 01:09:58.986
If they're looking for an Egyptian soldier,

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.520
it's better you don't look like one.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.128
Come on.

01:10:26.715 --> 01:10:29.717
Do you need help with the rest?

01:10:29.718 --> 01:10:31.384
Yes, please.

01:10:39.061 --> 01:10:42.195
I think you're old enough
to dress yourself.

01:10:49.171 --> 01:10:52.340
You've gained great strength
in such a short time.

01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:54.275
The gods have imposed their will.

01:10:54.276 --> 01:10:56.210
Was it the gods who dragged
you from the riverbed,

01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:59.947
stopped your bleeding
wound, kept you hidden?

01:10:59.948 --> 01:11:02.683
You mock the gods while they're
the proof that I still breathe.

01:11:02.684 --> 01:11:05.186
I do not mock the gods,

01:11:05.187 --> 01:11:08.122
but I see how they impose
their power over people.

01:11:08.123 --> 01:11:10.758
The greatest strength we
have is our own will.

01:11:10.759 --> 01:11:14.128
That is how I know you
are an important man.

01:11:14.129 --> 01:11:18.199
You would not let yourself die.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.601
Does your Mitanni grandmother
teach you these thoughts?

01:11:20.602 --> 01:11:23.204
I'm free to think for myself.

01:11:23.205 --> 01:11:26.006
You're wise to use caution.

01:11:26.007 --> 01:11:30.577

01:11:36.985 --> 01:11:41.122
This is my village.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.927
They can be trusted.

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:49.096
I cannot trust anyone, Suhad.

01:11:49.097 --> 01:11:52.400
The offering is not negotiable.

01:11:52.401 --> 01:11:55.202
The Temple of Sobek protects your land.

01:11:55.203 --> 01:11:58.038
His Holiness was lenient on my last visit.

01:11:58.039 --> 01:12:00.841
- He will not be again.
- We had a poor yield.

01:12:00.842 --> 01:12:03.511
- Father!
- Provide me with what I ask...

01:12:03.512 --> 01:12:05.413
Wait. Suhad, wait.

01:12:05.414 --> 01:12:06.781
Or I will take it all.

01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:08.182
You have no right to do this.

01:12:08.183 --> 01:12:10.584
Suhad! Go into the house.

01:12:10.585 --> 01:12:12.620
You speak to the Priest of Sobek,

01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:15.122
the God of Water, with cursed words?

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:18.159
Please, my daughter doesn't know her place.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.592
Then I will show it to her.

set the gods upon us.

01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:33.473
Please.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.951
You were once a man of the palace,

01:12:43.952 --> 01:12:46.487
a man of some importance.

01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:50.157
Why do you now hide when a new
Pharaoh is soon to be crowned?

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.126
What new Pharaoh?

01:12:52.127 --> 01:12:55.062
Pharaoh Tutankhamun did
not return from battle.

01:12:55.063 --> 01:12:57.598
His body was never found.

01:12:57.599 --> 01:13:00.701
And now they are looking for
a spy who betrayed them.

01:13:00.702 --> 01:13:02.470
Describe these men.

01:13:02.471 --> 01:13:03.921
The General's Guard.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:05.906
The palace is purging its enemies.

01:13:05.907 --> 01:13:07.507
He's not the enemy, Mother.

01:13:09.978 --> 01:13:12.011
How can this be?

01:13:17.235 --> 01:13:19.303
Wait!

Wait. You're really him?

01:13:27.512 --> 01:13:30.414
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:13:30.415 --> 01:13:32.382
Why didn't you tell me?

01:13:32.383 --> 01:13:34.184
Because I did not want you looking at me

01:13:34.185 --> 01:13:35.886
the way you do now,

01:13:35.887 --> 01:13:38.255

01:13:38.256 --> 01:13:41.023

even allowed to touch you.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.228

01:13:51.869 --> 01:13:54.204
They'll be waiting for you in Thebes.

01:13:54.205 --> 01:13:58.383
I cannot return alone. I
know a man that I can trust.

01:13:58.384 --> 01:14:00.952
He saved my life, but he was
captured by the Mitanni.

01:14:00.953 --> 01:14:03.688
Now, you know these lands.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:05.657
Can you tell me how to find him?

01:14:05.658 --> 01:14:08.393

they're only in one place,

01:14:08.394 --> 01:14:10.295

01:14:10.296 --> 01:14:11.796

No, it is too dangerous for you.

01:14:13.332 --> 01:14:16.801
It would be impossible for you
to get there on your own.

Mitanni know how to get there.
