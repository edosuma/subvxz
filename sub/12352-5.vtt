WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.633
Previously on Greek...

00:01.634 --> 00:03.869
They pulled me off the project.
I lost my wire.

00:03.903 --> 00:06.638
I can't apologize for being
confident in my abilities.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.575
Being confident is one thing.
But disparaging my work?

00:09.609 --> 00:11.143
It's like you have
no respect for me.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.112
We broke up.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.047
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Ash?

00:15.081 --> 00:16.081
Yeah?

00:16.116 --> 00:17.216
Tonight's all about
pledge presents.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.884
If it's ok with you,
I might skip tonight.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.219
- Do you mind?
- Totally get it.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.887
Will you be my date
for pledge presents?

00:21.921 --> 00:23.155
And what about your boyfriend?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.923
He can't be bothered
with a sorority party.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.159
Not when there's a law school
study group to go to.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.494
Why are you wearing
an Omega chi pledge pin?

00:28.528 --> 00:30.062
Because I'm pledging Omega chi.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.730
I know this is a 180 for me,

00:31.764 --> 00:33.465
but that doesn't have
to be a bad thing, right?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.767
Isn't that why you joined
kappa tau? To change?

00:35.802 --> 00:39.204
I'd kill to be a kt.
Even if I wasn't a legacy.

00:43.643 --> 00:47.079
Homecoming is
an epic kt tradition,

00:47.113 --> 00:50.349
steeped in the ancient lore
of the mighty, beer-raining,

00:50.383 --> 00:52.484
and yet,
dearly departed, vesuvius.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.486
A moment of silence, please.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.256
Last year, we mourned vesuvius
instead of throwing a party,

00:57.290 --> 00:59.658
and guess what happened?

00:59.692 --> 01:03.629
A&m knocked CRU out of the
top ten best party schools,

01:03.663 --> 01:05.297
according to
collegepartymonster.org.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.133
And dot-org's never lie.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.570
But all is not lost.
Because this year, we will reclaim our throne

01:11.604 --> 01:15.641
with a party so epic,
it'll defy belief.

01:15.675 --> 01:19.044
A party so elevated,
it'll defy gravity.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.647
A little party
I like to call...

01:21.681 --> 01:24.383
Everest!

01:24.417 --> 01:26.818
We will transform our house

01:26.853 --> 01:29.821
into the biggest series
of ice luges...

01:29.856 --> 01:32.057
Luges? Lugi? Lugie?

01:32.091 --> 01:33.358
Ever constructed!

01:33.393 --> 01:35.494
And by "we,"
I mean our pledges.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.962
- Pledges!
- Yeah, cap?

01:38.231 --> 01:41.867
Oh, right. Uh...
Sole pledge, spidey.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.635
Tools are in the shed,
good luck!

01:44.704 --> 01:45.337
Go on!

01:47.173 --> 01:49.374
Meeting adjourned!

01:49.409 --> 01:54.046
I am so glad to have my happy-go-lucky
spitter back. I missed him.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.616
Losing Dana and the wire at once
sucked, but no wallowing.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.452
And I'm pretty excited for spidey.
It's his first homecoming.

02:00.486 --> 02:02.254
I'll bet the alumnis are
gonna be super impressed

02:02.288 --> 02:04.356
when they see their old house
covered in ice, huh, cap?

02:04.390 --> 02:07.960
Our alums possess neither the will nor
wherewithal to find their way back here.

02:07.994 --> 02:11.496
Which is for the best, since no one
wants a bunch of old guys hanging out,

02:11.531 --> 02:13.865
reliving their
lost kt glory days.

02:15.768 --> 02:19.238
- Looks like kt never changes.
- Can we help you, sir?

02:19.272 --> 02:22.241
- Guys, I've got this.
- No, you get back to work, pledge!

02:22.275 --> 02:23.875
Everest isn't gonna
build itself.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.611
And this what I'm spending

02:25.645 --> 02:28.814
seven grand a month
on dues for, huh, kiddo?

02:28.848 --> 02:32.818
- Kiddo? 
- Guys, this is my dad, Lasker Parkes.

02:32.852 --> 02:36.021
Take a break, pledge!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.557
Welcome back to kt!

02:38.591 --> 02:41.560
Thank you.
That's my boy!

02:41.594 --> 02:42.661
- You having fun?
- Yeah!

02:42.695 --> 02:43.829
Everybody good to you?

02:48.468 --> 02:50.602
- Oh, gosh!
- Oh, sorry!

02:50.637 --> 02:52.037
The only outlet's
next to your desk.

02:52.071 --> 02:55.007
It's fine. I'm just
looking for my cell phone.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.110
Hey! So, I can't believe
it's homecoming already.

02:58.144 --> 03:01.013
- Crazy, right?
- I can't believe we're alumni.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.414
It feels like
we just graduated.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.383
I mean, I've been back
for five weeks,

03:04.417 --> 03:08.220
- but it feels like five days.
- More like five seconds.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.023
You sure it's ok, right?
Me staying here so long?

03:11.057 --> 03:13.292
- Oh, it's fine.
- I know it's an imposition.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.794
You are my best friend.
You can't be an imposition.

03:15.828 --> 03:19.498
Ok. Who knew looking
for a job would take so long?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.400
It happens so fast
in movie montages.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.201
What happened with
the office temp job?

03:23.236 --> 03:26.505
Uh, nothing. I can't even
get hired temporarily.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.274
But I do have a second interview
for a marketing firm today.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.309
I'm trying not
to get too excited.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.943
Oh, no, you should be excited.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.746
Who cares about a temp job
that was below you, anyway?

03:34.781 --> 03:37.649
- Oh! Well, thank you, case.
- Yeah.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.319
Hey, at least if I never get
hired for any job, like, ever,

03:40.353 --> 03:42.621
- I'll always have you by my side.
- Oh!

03:44.691 --> 03:46.658
Um, so...

03:46.693 --> 03:49.561
Flat irons in the bathroom only.
New rule!

03:49.595 --> 03:52.731
It's... fine.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.867
Sorry, sorry.

04:00.842 --> 04:04.734
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

04:09.013 --> 04:10.981
As I'm sure you remember,

04:11.015 --> 04:14.885
this is the game room,
where we...

04:14.919 --> 04:17.019
Play games,
as the name might suggest.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.990
You know, I think I was here
when we got this video game.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.192
Is this where you came up
with Joshua whopper?

04:22.227 --> 04:24.394
I... we all love him.
We're big fans.

04:24.429 --> 04:26.063
Is that what made you
wanna be an inventor?

04:26.097 --> 04:29.533
You know, I wouldn't call what my
company does "inventing," per se.

04:29.567 --> 04:33.804
- It's more... tech development.
- Oh, um...

04:33.838 --> 04:36.707
Well, have you "tech developed"
anything lately?

04:36.741 --> 04:39.176
Ooh, have you figured out
how to make a robot

04:39.210 --> 04:42.346
that can fall in love
and also experience fear?

04:42.380 --> 04:44.481
No, not yet.

04:44.516 --> 04:46.416
I work at a more macro level:

04:46.451 --> 04:50.020
Business strategy, boardroom
politics. That sort of thing.

04:50.054 --> 04:54.024
Well. That sounds... neat.

04:54.058 --> 04:58.028
We also have bathrooms,
where we... bathe.

04:58.062 --> 05:01.999
- Peter, wanna show your papa?
- Sure, yeah. Come on, dad.

05:02.033 --> 05:04.134
I'll show you the
downstairs one first.

05:06.204 --> 05:10.807
Wow, the Lasker Parkes, our most
prestigious alum, in the flesh.

05:10.842 --> 05:13.944
Depressing, huh? He's just
another corporate drone.

05:13.978 --> 05:16.513
It's like finding out
Santa claus left the north pole

05:16.548 --> 05:18.782
to sit in a cubicle
and listen to npr.

05:18.816 --> 05:21.218
He's the ceo of
a fortune 500 company,

05:21.252 --> 05:22.819
using his corporate drone money

05:22.854 --> 05:25.289
to pay enough dues to cover
a full pledge class.

05:25.323 --> 05:28.792
Exactly. Which means, as dull as he
may be, we gotta keep him happy,

05:28.826 --> 05:32.062
and make sure he knows we're
making his son happy, too.

05:32.096 --> 05:34.565
Hey, that one was taken.

05:34.599 --> 05:36.099
You want me to show you
the upstairs one?

05:36.134 --> 05:37.534
No, not really,

05:37.569 --> 05:39.403
I want to know what
it's like for you as a kt.

05:39.437 --> 05:42.706
- Who's your big brother?
- My big what?

05:42.740 --> 05:46.577
Really... you haven't had
your big/little weekend yet?

05:46.611 --> 05:48.378
- No... we're gonna...
- We... we're gonna...

05:48.413 --> 05:50.714
We're sorting through data
and we were gonna...

05:50.748 --> 05:54.218
We wanted it to
be a surprise. Surprise!

05:54.252 --> 05:57.454
We're gonna do the bigúbro
ceremony tomorrow at the party.

05:57.488 --> 06:01.225
The party. We are. Absolutely.
That is and was always our plan.

06:01.259 --> 06:03.760
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I can't wait to see that.

06:03.795 --> 06:07.097
No, I can't wait
for you to see that!

06:11.502 --> 06:15.172
You totally shot me down in front of the entire
class before I was finished making my point.

06:15.206 --> 06:18.342
You can't just claim negligence,
all right? Listen...

06:18.376 --> 06:21.578
- If you can't take the heat...
- Speak in clichés?

06:21.613 --> 06:24.848
- You are extra irritable today.
- I haven't been sleeping well.

06:24.882 --> 06:27.818
- Ashleigh has started snoring.
- She's still staying with you?

06:27.852 --> 06:30.254
I love Ash.

06:30.288 --> 06:34.758
And yes, it is the most depressing time to
find a job since the actual depression.

06:34.792 --> 06:38.428
But we're in this room that can
barely hold all of our appendages.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.664
Look, case, you just
gotta be honest with her.

06:40.698 --> 06:42.833
- Tell her to find her own place.
- I can't. She's my best friend.

06:42.867 --> 06:46.937
Well, she won't be for long, if
you let things continue this way.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.939
- Just give her a little push.
- Maybe you're right.

06:48.973 --> 06:53.010
Wow, this is not going to be
an easy conversation to have.

06:53.044 --> 06:56.413
Huh? Right. Yeah, just...
You know, do it.

06:56.447 --> 06:59.583
It's like ripping off a band-aid.
Save the friendship. It's great.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.052
Oh, hell, no.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.123
- Hi, Professor Segal!
- Professor Segal, hi!

07:06.157 --> 07:09.526
- Miss Cartwright. Mr. chambers.
- Great class today.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.329
- The discussion of transferred intent was...
- Incredibly stimulating.

07:12.363 --> 07:15.766
Stimulating. Well, I'm late for lunch
but you're both more than welcome

07:15.800 --> 07:19.303
to continue sucking up to me
tomorrow at the alumni reception.

07:19.337 --> 07:20.337
You're both CRU alums, right?

07:20.371 --> 07:21.571
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

07:21.606 --> 07:23.273
- Great job in class today.
- Thanks!

07:23.308 --> 07:25.175
Thank you so much. Bye.

07:31.616 --> 07:33.350
Kappa tau!

07:34.819 --> 07:36.987
I'm so excited for this weekend
I can barely eat!

07:37.021 --> 07:40.257
Good, you'll avoid bloating.
I want my favorite pledge to have a memorable weekend.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.292
And by "memorable",
you mean...?

07:42.327 --> 07:44.561
Helping Heather seduce
the entire CRU Greek system.

07:44.595 --> 07:47.197
- Ah, yes. - Rebecca, you know
hee-ther's my little sister, right?

07:47.231 --> 07:49.833
Well, you can help Heather, too,
but that's kinda creepy.

07:49.867 --> 07:53.603
Just make sure you show up to the kt homecoming
party tomorrow night after the pep rally.

07:53.638 --> 07:56.173
- It's gonna be awesome.
- You know, the last kt homecoming that I went to

07:56.207 --> 07:58.508
- was when your brother and I first
started dating. - [Heather] Cute!

07:58.543 --> 08:00.277
- Can we go?
- It wouldn't be a homecoming

08:00.311 --> 08:02.279
without a wild,
out-of-control kt party.

08:02.313 --> 08:05.048
Well, don't stay too long...
Whatever your name is.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.584
'Cause you'll literally feel
your brain cells start to die.

08:07.618 --> 08:10.887
Whatever, bing. We're building
a complex Mountain of luges.

08:10.922 --> 08:14.191
<i>It's an everwood theme party, because of
the Mountain and the snow, you know?</i>

08:14.225 --> 08:17.994
Everest, heath.
You know, like the Mountain?

08:19.030 --> 08:20.897
Yeah, that makes
a lot more sense.

08:20.932 --> 08:24.334
Oh, by the way, I can't make
the pep rally tomorrow night.

08:24.369 --> 08:27.537
I've got this alumni event, and my torts
Professor is gonna be there, so...

08:27.572 --> 08:30.207
I gotta kinda...
That's cool, right?

08:30.241 --> 08:31.942
Why wouldn't it be?

08:31.976 --> 08:34.144
I'll focus my energy
on Heather and the pledges.

08:36.447 --> 08:38.849
- Yikes, I'm late for class.
- Oh, I'll walk you.

08:38.883 --> 08:41.485
I have to get to my "history of
soap operas" seminar....

08:41.519 --> 08:43.186
- See you around.
- Bye.

08:46.124 --> 08:49.092
<i>- Everwood? - Oh, come on.
He just misunderstood.</i>

08:49.127 --> 08:51.228
- He must be really good in bed.
- Yeah, he is.

08:51.262 --> 08:55.465
But he's also kind and he's
funny, he's incredibly sweet...

08:55.500 --> 08:57.667
You don't have to justify
your relationship to us, Cal.

09:00.538 --> 09:02.506
He's a good dancer.

09:04.509 --> 09:07.711
The woman was just so uptight.

09:07.745 --> 09:09.780
I mean, "hi, can you smile?"

09:09.814 --> 09:13.116
Then she just stopped abruptly and was like,
"thanks for coming in. We'll call you."

09:13.151 --> 09:15.318
She said she'll call you.
That's good news.

09:15.353 --> 09:18.655
They all say that. It's not my first
time to the job interview rodeo.

09:18.689 --> 09:22.492
Maybe she liked you.
Some people just don't smile!

09:25.263 --> 09:27.030
Well, you're smiling a lot.
What's up, case?

09:27.064 --> 09:31.601
Nothing's up, it's just... I was thinking
about what we discussed this morning...

09:31.636 --> 09:33.370
How you've been living with me
for five weeks.

09:33.404 --> 09:35.038
Yeah, and how awesome
you've been about it.

09:35.072 --> 09:39.543
Right. I was just thinking
that maybe it is time for you

09:39.577 --> 09:42.879
to start looking for your own place.
You know, to live. Like an apartment. Or something.

09:42.914 --> 09:47.350
Uh-huh. Absolutely.
An apartment would be... Uh-huh.

09:47.385 --> 09:50.654
I just have to figure out the whole
paying rent to a landlord thing.

09:50.688 --> 09:53.190
- Yeah, that...
- Yeah.

09:53.224 --> 09:55.091
Maybe you could live
with rusty for a while.

09:56.427 --> 09:59.863
No, I can't live with rusty.
No. He's so...

09:59.897 --> 10:02.899
Yeah, right, that was
a stupid idea, I know.

10:02.934 --> 10:04.534
You know I love
living with you, right?

10:04.569 --> 10:07.871
- Yeah, of course.
- Ok. So...

10:07.905 --> 10:11.141
So, I will get an apartment.
As soon as I get a job.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.210
Great.

10:16.347 --> 10:18.615
So, we have to stop partying
at the party

10:18.649 --> 10:21.184
to have a big bro ceremony?
Just to impress some old guy?

10:21.219 --> 10:23.019
An old guy whose old guy money

10:23.054 --> 10:25.388
is financing many of our
young guy activities.

10:25.423 --> 10:27.624
Do we really have to do
that whole boring process

10:27.658 --> 10:29.226
where the pledge
writes down three names?

10:29.260 --> 10:33.129
Well, I think we all know who
Peter's big brother should be.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.702
- Me, I'm talking about me.
- Oh...

10:40.705 --> 10:42.539
I'm happy for you, Rus.

10:42.573 --> 10:44.541
We both know what
it's like to...

10:44.575 --> 10:46.243
Lose a little brother.

10:46.277 --> 10:48.945
Me with Scooby and you
with Andylicious.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.047
Now you're getting
the second chance that I never had.

10:51.082 --> 10:53.517
Will you guys excuse me?
I've got something in my eye.

10:56.554 --> 11:00.090
I'm gonna do it right this time.
I'm gonna Bond, have long talks...

11:00.124 --> 11:02.259
Scooby!

11:02.293 --> 11:05.695
Well, you're both big-brained,
yet spindly in stature.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.765
You both speak fluent nerd.
Spidey & spitter...

11:08.799 --> 11:11.568
Well, that's fun to say. Looks like
you've got yourself a new little brother!

11:11.602 --> 11:14.037
There you go, spidey.
I'll help you unload the rest of that ice.

11:14.071 --> 11:17.741
- Oh, thanks.
- So, is papa parkes having fun?

11:17.775 --> 11:20.043
Oh, loads! Yeah. Um...

11:20.077 --> 11:21.611
I had a question about
the big brother ceremony.

11:21.646 --> 11:24.481
You don't have to do it naked.
Heath was just messing with you.

11:24.515 --> 11:28.485
No, actually, I was wondering...
Would you be my big brother?

11:28.519 --> 11:32.455
Me? Don't you think rusty
would be a better match?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.926
Rusty's great, but you're
Cappie! I mean...

11:35.960 --> 11:40.530
You're just so awesome, and
cool, and funny and... Cappie!

11:40.565 --> 11:43.567
- Yes, that is my name. - Look, I know
you can't tell me until the ceremony,

11:43.601 --> 11:45.602
but I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't hoping it was you.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.705
You're not holding out
for someone else, are you?

11:49.840 --> 11:52.342
You get it?
'Cause I'm the only pledge...

11:52.376 --> 11:55.345
Oh, I got it. See, you don't even need me.
You're funny already!

11:55.379 --> 11:57.747
Now get that ice out of here.

11:57.782 --> 11:59.482
All right.

12:06.081 --> 12:09.450
You're so lucky to have Evan.
He's like one of those shirtless greeters

12:09.485 --> 12:12.720
at the Abercrombie stores,
but like, romantic and smart.

12:12.755 --> 12:14.155
You'll have your own
Evan some day.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.824
Some day might be sooner
than you think.

12:15.858 --> 12:18.293
Heath promised to find me
a boyfriend at the kt party.

12:18.327 --> 12:20.161
Heather, you're my
number one pledge.

12:20.196 --> 12:22.530
You can't be bogged down
by a boyfriend right now.

12:25.801 --> 12:31.206
Hey, becks.
I have a tiny favor...

12:31.240 --> 12:33.875
Could you possibly, maybe...

12:33.909 --> 12:36.945
Consider...

12:36.979 --> 12:38.813
Giving Ash and me
our old room back?

12:38.848 --> 12:41.683
Heather, the help made a funny.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.385
Fine. What if she
stayed here with you?

12:44.420 --> 12:47.088
- Just for a little bit.
- But where would I put my exercise center?

12:47.122 --> 12:49.123
I'm sure she'll
find something soon.

12:49.158 --> 12:51.926
Experts say the economy should be
back on its feet any year now.

12:51.961 --> 12:54.362
Would you excuse us?
We're talking about homecoming.

12:54.396 --> 12:56.731
And all the hot guys I'm gonna meet
at the kt party tomorrow night.

12:56.765 --> 12:59.167
Oh, Rebecca, you know
the rules from nationals.

12:59.201 --> 13:01.336
Only university-sponsored events
during homecoming.

13:01.370 --> 13:03.805
- But everyone goes to the kt party.
- Not us, not this year.

13:03.839 --> 13:07.809
Nationals is cracking down.
You can't go to that party. Ok?

13:09.011 --> 13:10.712
- Ok.
- Really mean it.

13:10.746 --> 13:14.883
- Ok. - You can't just say
"ok" and then do it, anyway.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.718
- Rebecca?
- Ok.

13:19.755 --> 13:20.588
Ok.

13:27.029 --> 13:28.897
- We're still going, right?
- Obviously.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.902
Hey! Check it out!

13:33.936 --> 13:38.506
<i>Ah, George Orwell's classic dystopian
novel, nineteen eighty-four.</i>

13:38.540 --> 13:40.141
Isn't it supposed
to be "watching you?"

13:40.175 --> 13:42.076
Well, it's for Peter.
We're having our big bro ceremony

13:42.111 --> 13:44.445
at the party tomorrow night.
I'm gonna give it to him after.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.647
You haven't matched up yet?

13:45.681 --> 13:47.415
Me and my big, trip,
are already besties.

13:47.449 --> 13:48.650
Trip's your big brother?

13:48.684 --> 13:50.385
Yeah, you know, I never
thought I could be friends

13:50.419 --> 13:53.755
with a red-top, either. But, he's the Prez.
Only the best for me.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.257
<i>- Hey, what are you watching?
- Thomas crown affair,</i>

13:56.292 --> 13:59.060
the sub-par remake with that
pretty boy Pierce Brosnan.

13:59.094 --> 14:00.495
If you don't like it,
why are you watching it?

14:00.529 --> 14:02.397
I don't know.
Because I am.

14:02.431 --> 14:04.132
What's with the third degree?

14:04.166 --> 14:07.001
I don't... I didn't mean...
You don't have to be so...

14:07.036 --> 14:09.037
- Hi! -
Hey, what's up, cap?

14:09.071 --> 14:11.806
Daley, you coming to our already
legendary Everest party?

14:11.840 --> 14:14.442
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
I'm the enemy now, remember?

14:14.476 --> 14:17.512
Oh, of course.
I guess that means I hate you.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.717
So, what's Omega chi
doing for homecoming?

14:22.751 --> 14:25.720
- A Jack Johnson sing-a-long?
- No. Why?

14:25.754 --> 14:26.788
Who's asking?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.525
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, so listen...

14:30.559 --> 14:31.960
I was, uh...

14:31.994 --> 14:35.096
I was talking to spidey earlier and...
Yeah?

14:35.130 --> 14:41.102
He may have asked me
to be his big brother.

14:41.136 --> 14:44.305
Oh. Wow. Ok.

14:44.340 --> 14:47.075
Pledges are an impressionable
bunch, if you recall.

14:47.109 --> 14:50.111
No, I get it. Hey, it's not
like I can blame him.

14:50.145 --> 14:51.713
You're a pretty
great big brother.

14:51.747 --> 14:55.950
And I guess the big bro thing
isn't meant for me.

14:55.985 --> 14:57.685
Isn't this supposed
to be "watching you?"

14:58.754 --> 15:02.523
Oh, this was for spidey.
You know what?

15:02.558 --> 15:05.393
Why are we letting Peter decide?
He's a pledge. We're actives.

15:05.427 --> 15:07.495
- We decide stuff.
- I don't wanna force him.

15:07.529 --> 15:10.498
The ceremony isn't until
tomorrow. Nothing's final yet.

15:10.532 --> 15:14.702
That's true. Maybe I can make
Peter want me as his big brother.

15:14.737 --> 15:16.571
Seduce him with your big-ness.

15:17.606 --> 15:18.906
You know what I mean.

15:23.812 --> 15:25.413
Knock, knock! Can I come in?

15:25.447 --> 15:27.715
As long as you're not here to say
more mean things about hfath.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.050
I said he must be good in bed.

15:30.486 --> 15:31.919
What's up, Rebecca?

15:31.954 --> 15:34.188
I was wondering if you could
ask your sex-machine boyfriend

15:34.223 --> 15:35.990
if he could not set Heather
up with a guy tomorrow.

15:36.025 --> 15:38.359
Oh, so, you're worried
that heath is too dumb

15:38.394 --> 15:40.628
to pick a guy
that's up to your standards.

15:40.662 --> 15:42.330
Don't go all
oversensitive gay on me.

15:42.364 --> 15:44.599
I just think you and heath
have an interesting dynamic.

15:44.633 --> 15:47.735
You're smart, ambitious, and
heath's the hottie on your arm.

15:47.770 --> 15:50.038
I see. Because you and Evan
are so perfect, right?

15:50.072 --> 15:52.673
Despite the fact that
last week, you told hee-ther

15:52.708 --> 15:56.878
to tell heath to tell me that you were
taking cappie to pledge presents?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.447
No one's perfect,
but we are equals.

15:59.481 --> 16:02.116
Heath clearly needs you
more than you need him.

16:02.151 --> 16:04.085
You're the mount Everest
to his bunny slope.

16:07.923 --> 16:11.192
I've been going through some stuff lately.
Some personal and academic dilemmas.

16:11.226 --> 16:13.728
- You name it, I got it.
- Wow, I'm surprised he hasn't dumped you by now.

16:13.762 --> 16:15.263
What? No. He doesn't
even know about it.

16:15.297 --> 16:17.398
Because you don't talk about
that serious, deep stuff, right?

16:17.433 --> 16:20.268
We talk about deep stuff.
All the time.

16:20.302 --> 16:22.537
Great, so during these
profound explorations of self,

16:22.571 --> 16:24.972
could you ask him to ease up
on the matchmaker business?

16:27.810 --> 16:30.478
Oh, I am so glad that
we decided to do this.

16:30.512 --> 16:32.680
Titan spirit is in the air!

16:32.714 --> 16:35.683
And I'm buying you a drink tonight
as a thank you for being so great.

16:35.717 --> 16:37.752
- No, you don't need to...
- No, it's fine. We just have to order

16:37.786 --> 16:39.554
before the end of
three-dollar happy hour.

16:39.588 --> 16:41.889
- Um, can we have two beers please?
- You got it.

16:41.924 --> 16:44.025
Uh-oh. Look who's here.

16:44.059 --> 16:47.762
- Happy homecoming.
- Good to see you. Hi.

16:47.796 --> 16:49.097
Cappie.

16:50.499 --> 16:53.234
Just putting up a poster for
our big Everest party tomorrow.

16:53.268 --> 16:57.939
- You gals should stop by.
- Oh, I have an alumni barbeque that night.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.475
- But thanks.
- Yeah, 'cause we're alums, so...

17:00.509 --> 17:03.044
How's the post-college job hunt
treating you, ashleigh?

17:03.078 --> 17:06.214
Oh, it's treating me well.
I've got some jobs in my sights.

17:06.248 --> 17:07.714
Following the scent on a few.

17:07.749 --> 17:09.983
You know, I heard they're
hiring a barback position here,

17:10.018 --> 17:12.286
if you're in need
for some extra cash.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.156
- She does need that.
- No, I'm focusing on a career right now.

17:15.190 --> 17:19.660
Well, good luck. I'm off
to tend to my blowtorch.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.770
You know, that barback
thing didn't sound completely awful.

17:29.805 --> 17:31.806
Ah, it's not really
what I'm looking for.

17:33.609 --> 17:35.943
And you're really gonna
need that at some point. Soon.

17:35.978 --> 17:39.413
Like, now. For an apartment.

17:39.448 --> 17:42.917
You know what I need right
now, case, is just some time.

17:42.951 --> 17:46.087
But, hey, maybe I could go with you
to that barbeque thing tomorrow?

17:46.121 --> 17:49.524
- There could be some alums there hiring.
- Yeah. Sure.

17:49.558 --> 17:51.626
Great. Cheers!

17:55.764 --> 18:01.235
So, we're running down the street and then
I hear this Omega chi start screaming,

18:01.270 --> 18:04.505
"hey! Who day-glowed
that onto my swatch?!"

18:06.208 --> 18:09.844
Hey, isn't it a weird coincidence
that 80s Omega chi sucked, too?

18:09.878 --> 18:11.946
Maybe the house is evil and turns
them all into Brody Jenners.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.714
Ooh, maybe there's
a preppy ghost

18:13.749 --> 18:16.684
and he forces them to pop their
collars and wear ugly ties.

18:16.718 --> 18:19.854
Preppy ghost.
That's a good one, cap.

18:19.888 --> 18:22.423
Yeah, and then the ghost
tells them to vote republican.

18:24.459 --> 18:28.196
Uh, ok, no more story time.
We don't wanna wear out poor Mr. parkes.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.965
No! Tell us a homecoming story.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.434
Oh, well, I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

18:33.468 --> 18:36.737
There are very few pranks
we left unexplored.

18:36.772 --> 18:39.874
If you could go back to school, like
Rodney dangerfield in that movie...

18:39.908 --> 18:44.045
What was it called? I forget.
Anyway, what would you do?

18:44.079 --> 18:48.115
Uh... the biggest thing
nobody ever pulled off?

18:48.150 --> 18:51.485
Stealing the a&m goat
before homecoming.

18:51.520 --> 18:56.357
Every farmhand with an ounce of school
pride guards that thing in shifts.

18:56.391 --> 19:00.127
- It's impossible. - Why haven't we
ever tried to steal the goat, cap?

19:00.162 --> 19:01.729
You heard the man.
It's impossible.

19:01.763 --> 19:03.164
Nothing's impossible.

19:10.034 --> 19:13.369
So I'm thinking we start by casing
the a&m agricultural building.

19:13.404 --> 19:16.406
Then, we come back here and formulate
the perfect goat-stealing plan.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.242
- And then we steal the goat?
- You learn fast, young padawan.

19:19.276 --> 19:21.411
I forgot to put sunscreen on
my face. I'll be right back.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.016
Hey, where you going with
that backpack, spitter?

19:27.051 --> 19:29.152
One of your nerd classes meeting
during homecoming again?

19:29.186 --> 19:31.988
Sure, if it's a class
on goat stealing!

19:32.022 --> 19:34.557
Spidey and I are gonna
go steal the a&m goat tonight.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.126
- The impossible to steal a&m goat?
- Not after we're done with it.

19:37.161 --> 19:39.362
This is my chance to show Peter
I can be a cool big brother.

19:39.396 --> 19:41.931
Why can't you just buy him some porn
and a lap dance and call it a day?

19:41.965 --> 19:46.436
Peter has brittle bones. An aggressive
lap dance could paralyze him for life.

19:46.470 --> 19:49.038
Good point, but what if your plan
fails and Peter is disappointed?

19:49.073 --> 19:51.641
Cap, you've given me the best two
years of my life as big brother.

19:51.675 --> 19:54.010
You made me who I am,
someone I'm proud to be.

19:54.044 --> 19:57.513
And I want to be that person for someone,
and I think it could be Peter.

19:57.548 --> 20:01.417
Fine. Go. I'll stay here and
keep our benefactor happy.

20:01.452 --> 20:03.853
- Good luck.
- You think we can pull it off, right?

20:03.887 --> 20:05.621
I hope that goat
packed his bags.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:14.665 --> 20:17.166
Can we talk about something
a little bit more serious?

20:17.201 --> 20:19.335
Yeah.

20:19.369 --> 20:23.172
You know how sometimes people
have another side to themselves,

20:23.207 --> 20:24.874
that they keep secret?

20:24.908 --> 20:27.610
Yeah, like super heroes. Or...

20:30.114 --> 20:34.717
Yeah, so... the thing is, they don't want to
really reveal the truth about themselves,

20:34.751 --> 20:38.087
because, well,
because they kind of like

20:38.122 --> 20:41.457
how people view them
in a certain way.

20:41.492 --> 20:44.527
Beaver told you about me stripping
at the Rio nightclub, didn't he?

20:44.561 --> 20:46.796
Stripping? As in, a stripper?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.398
- You? For money?
- You didn't know?

20:49.433 --> 20:51.367
Then what were
you talking about?

20:51.401 --> 20:53.769
Oh God, did Casey tell you about the
whole test-paper selling thing?

20:53.804 --> 20:55.972
- What? - What the hell do you
want to talk to me about?

20:56.006 --> 21:00.309
Stop talking. I was gonna tell
you that I don't have a major.

21:00.344 --> 21:02.845
Really?
Why'd you never tell me?

21:02.880 --> 21:05.081
Does it really matter now?

21:15.959 --> 21:17.927
Welcome, fellow titan alums!

21:17.961 --> 21:21.998
I'm just moseying around this little
shindig, taking some donations.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.934
So, can I get you
to give back to CRU?

21:24.968 --> 21:27.970
- Oh, uh... go titans.
- Go titans!

21:30.707 --> 21:32.441
Oh, I can smell the free buffet.

21:32.476 --> 21:35.711
- Oh, there's Segal.
- He's handsome.

21:35.746 --> 21:37.880
Ew. And he's with Evan.
I have got to get over there.

21:37.915 --> 21:41.350
Go network!
You're gonna be great.

21:50.394 --> 21:53.296
Hi, fellow titan alums.
I'm ashleigh Howard.

21:53.330 --> 21:54.697
We were just talking about
the big game tomorrow.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.133
Ready to watch the titans
whoop some a&m ass?

21:57.167 --> 22:00.169
Yeah! Hell, yeah! I love watching
them throw around that lambskin.

22:00.204 --> 22:04.373
So, what do
you do... Joe Lysacek?

22:04.408 --> 22:06.842
- I'm a dental surgeon.
- Oh, teeth. Fun.

22:06.877 --> 22:10.546
Well, I'm looking for work in
marketing and trend forecasting.

22:10.581 --> 22:13.649
Trend forecasting?
In this economy?

22:13.684 --> 22:16.485
- Ouch. - It's hard out
there right now, huh?

22:16.520 --> 22:18.454
Uh, yeah, but I'm
hanging in there.

22:18.488 --> 22:21.424
I read that average starting
salaries are down from last year.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.993
- Uh-huh. - The jobless rate
amongst college graduates

22:24.027 --> 22:26.562
hanging just over 18 percent.

22:26.597 --> 22:28.531
So many kids are just
going to grad school.

22:28.565 --> 22:30.199
Uh-huh, I heard that, too.

22:30.234 --> 22:32.401
- I'm actually looking to hire someone.
- Really?

22:32.436 --> 22:35.304
Yeah. I need a part-time
nanny for my two boys.

22:35.339 --> 22:37.473
Oh, wait.
Do you know cpr?

22:40.811 --> 22:43.346
That is one
heavily-guarded goat.

22:47.184 --> 22:48.985
I bet you and cappie pulled off
cool pranks like this

22:49.019 --> 22:51.454
- when you were a freshman, huh?
- A few, I guess.

22:51.488 --> 22:54.056
So if cappie becomes my
big bro, that'll make us...

22:54.091 --> 22:57.260
- ...Half little bros, right?
- Yeah, something like that.

22:57.294 --> 23:00.696
I don't know. You seem pretty set
on cappie becoming your big bro.

23:00.731 --> 23:03.132
Yeah, it'd be awesome.
We'll see.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.102
What is it about that cappie guy
that you want him so bad?

23:06.136 --> 23:09.272
- As opposed to the other brothers.
- He's just... confident.

23:09.306 --> 23:12.742
And... he takes risks
without worrying.

23:12.776 --> 23:14.844
Pretty much the opposite of me
in about a million ways.

23:24.955 --> 23:27.023
- Rusty?
- Dale?

23:29.660 --> 23:30.860
Go, go!

23:30.894 --> 23:33.663
Is this why you were acting
all paranoid yesterday?

23:33.697 --> 23:35.665
No such thing as paranoia
when you sleep with the enemy.

23:35.699 --> 23:37.667
I knew you were trying
to suss out my plan.

23:37.701 --> 23:42.004
I was not trying to suss out anything.
We decided to steal the goat this morning.

23:42.039 --> 23:44.940
Besides, I don't think the
Bible would approve of you

23:44.975 --> 23:46.642
stealing thy neighbor's goat.

23:46.677 --> 23:49.378
The Bible doesn't say zip about
kidnapping thy neighbor's goat

23:49.413 --> 23:51.347
to psych out thy neighbor
before a big game.

23:51.381 --> 23:52.748
And I've had this planned
for weeks.

23:52.783 --> 23:55.484
My pledge bros jumped at the
chance to help me make history.

23:55.519 --> 23:58.921
- Do I look like Michelle Obama?
- Well, you and your pledge bros

23:58.955 --> 24:02.391
- won't be making any history
tonight, bro. - Says who?

24:02.426 --> 24:05.761
- You and tiny Tim here? - Whoa!
I once ran an eight-and-a-half minute mile!

24:05.796 --> 24:08.331
- In jeans!
- So did my alcoholic aunt Trudy.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.566
- And she didn't even remember it.
- Back off, Dale, all right?

24:10.600 --> 24:13.235
This goat has kt written
all over it. Just go home.

24:13.270 --> 24:16.305
Sorry, Rus. I got a plan so sweet,
it'll give you a toothache.

24:16.340 --> 24:19.342
We're going in there.
Now, if I were you,

24:19.376 --> 24:21.010
I'd leave now before
you embarrass yourself.

24:21.044 --> 24:24.013
- Seriously? Dude, seriously...
- All right?

24:25.349 --> 24:26.515
Oh, great.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.619
I guess it was a long shot
for us anyways, huh?

24:34.725 --> 24:36.792
- We're going in too.
- Without a plan?

24:36.827 --> 24:38.894
Shouldn't we call for
reinforcements, like cappie?

24:38.929 --> 24:42.832
Pledge, there's no time!
Are you in or out?

24:46.169 --> 24:47.203
I'm in.

24:48.405 --> 24:51.440
And so I went!
It was a cool summer experience.

24:51.475 --> 24:54.910
- Dc is fun. So much energy.
- It must've been inspiring

24:54.945 --> 24:57.346
- to see Paula Baker in action
on the house floor. - Hm.

24:57.381 --> 25:00.349
- Talk about tenacious.
- Oh, it was. And, she is.

25:00.384 --> 25:03.252
I can't wait to get back
to dc after law school.

25:03.286 --> 25:06.989
You know, Professor, I
was planning on going to DC, too,

25:07.023 --> 25:10.526
but after taking classes, I don't know,
I think I might want to practice.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.296
Well, I've been studying law half my life,
and I still learn something new every day.

25:14.331 --> 25:17.633
Although, the dead lawyer jokes
do start to grate after a while.

25:18.468 --> 25:20.970
I love the law, too.

25:21.004 --> 25:23.639
I love the law so much
I wanna make new laws.

25:23.673 --> 25:27.710
I think politicians are more famous for
breaking laws than making new ones.

25:27.744 --> 25:29.779
Touché, Mr. chambers.

25:29.813 --> 25:31.580
Sorry to interrupt.

25:31.615 --> 25:34.316
Um, I'm all schmoozed-out, so
it's time to raid the buffet.

25:34.351 --> 25:35.684
Would you like me
to get you anything?

25:35.719 --> 25:40.356
Oh, no, I'm good. Professor,
this is ashleigh Howard.

25:40.390 --> 25:41.424
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.491
Ashleigh, this is
Professor Segal.

25:42.526 --> 25:44.026
I'm sorry you're
not having any fun.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.895
Yeah, that's ok.

25:45.929 --> 25:48.197
Any chance you're looking
to hire a trend forecaster?

25:48.231 --> 25:52.535
- Ah, I am a law Professor.
- The law has its trends, doesn't it?

25:52.569 --> 25:54.103
It certainly does.

25:55.572 --> 25:56.872
Hi, titan alums!

25:56.907 --> 25:59.141
Would any of you like
to donate to your Alma mater?

25:59.176 --> 26:01.143
No, not right now.
Thank you, though.

26:01.178 --> 26:04.079
Oh, come on! Don't you want
to give something to the school

26:04.114 --> 26:05.247
that gave you four great years?

26:05.282 --> 26:06.849
Well, I already gave
four years of my life.

26:06.883 --> 26:08.884
And what good did that do me?
I might as well have gone

26:08.919 --> 26:10.553
to the Hogwarts school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

26:10.587 --> 26:12.388
So, you know what?
You can just give me that clipboard,

26:12.422 --> 26:14.690
because I should be the one
asking you to donate money to me.

26:17.761 --> 26:19.161
Go titans!

26:20.163 --> 26:21.430
Professor, wanna
join me at the bar?

26:21.465 --> 26:23.232
- Yeah.
- Ok.

26:26.837 --> 26:28.871
We should go hit up
that buffet, huh?

26:34.217 --> 26:36.919
I don't get it.
What have I done wrong?

26:36.953 --> 26:41.557
- Why can't I find a job?
- Well, you could've gotten one job.

26:41.591 --> 26:43.092
Don't say dobler's.

26:43.126 --> 26:44.960
It's a job that pays
real money.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.995
You were the one that made me
want more for myself.

26:47.030 --> 26:48.797
Why are you asking me
to give it all up now?

26:48.832 --> 26:51.700
I'm not asking you to give anything up,
I'm just asking you to be practical.

26:51.735 --> 26:55.070
I don't know why I ever thought you'd
understand how hard it is out there.

26:55.105 --> 26:58.407
That is so not fair. You know how hard I've
had to fight to survive in law school.

26:58.441 --> 27:00.776
Not to mention I'm
the house mother to 50 girls.

27:00.810 --> 27:02.144
I get it. You're busy!
Your life is full.

27:02.178 --> 27:04.213
And my life is
empty and pathetic.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.015
- I never said that! - The minute you
told me to wash dishes at dobler's,

27:07.050 --> 27:08.450
it was pretty clear
what you thought.

27:08.485 --> 27:11.653
Taking a job doesn't mean you
have to stop pursuing a career.

27:11.688 --> 27:14.656
I've been in school for 16 years and
now I have nothing to show for it

27:14.691 --> 27:16.892
except maybe a chance
to wash dishes in a bar?

27:16.926 --> 27:19.728
You have a path. Three years of
school, then you move to Washington.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.997
I don't have one road
with easy turns.

27:22.031 --> 27:25.434
- All I have are... forks!
- Ok, well, that's just the way it is!

27:25.468 --> 27:27.202
Thousands of people
graduated in may,

27:27.237 --> 27:28.470
and none of us
are owed anything.

27:28.505 --> 27:30.539
You have to think short-term
as well as long.

27:30.573 --> 27:32.808
Oh, I think about it, trust me.
Every time I get rejected

27:32.842 --> 27:34.276
from yet another job,
I think about it.

27:34.310 --> 27:36.211
Really? Because it seems more
like you're wasting your time,

27:36.246 --> 27:38.447
stuck on some post-grad fairy tale
that's not happening right now!

27:38.481 --> 27:40.916
Oh, yes, please teach me
about fairy tales and reality.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.519
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Cappie.

27:43.553 --> 27:46.421
I'm not even with cappie!
I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.792
How much more time are you gonna
waste on that stupid fairy tale?

27:49.826 --> 27:51.794
I can't believe I wasted
my time trying to help you.

27:51.828 --> 27:55.464
Well, I'm freeing you
of your obligation. Go!

28:12.882 --> 28:15.184
Everest!

28:27.263 --> 28:30.799
I'm impressed. We never could've pulled
off a party like this in my day.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.570
Darn. I was hoping for another one of
your wild stories from your lost youth.

28:34.604 --> 28:37.739
When I was your age,
I would've thought a guy like me

28:37.774 --> 28:42.511
- was a total douchebag.
- Never crossed my mind.

28:42.545 --> 28:45.247
You probably think every office
is like a dilbert cartoon.

28:45.281 --> 28:48.417
I have a recurring nightmare where I'm
at a computer typing really fast,

28:48.451 --> 28:50.752
with drool running down my face.

28:50.787 --> 28:53.121
I've had the same nightmare.
So, when I graduated,

28:53.156 --> 28:56.425
I promised myself that I would make the
campus of Lasker Parkes incorporated

28:56.459 --> 29:00.028
- a lot like kt.
- You have a campus?

29:00.063 --> 29:03.031
Yeah. It's on our own lake,
amongst the evergreens.

29:03.066 --> 29:06.935
Baseball diamond, basketball courts,
foosball, ping pong, video games.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.971
Wait, wait, wait.
They let you call that work?

29:09.005 --> 29:12.808
Creative people need to relax,
recharge throughout the day.

29:12.842 --> 29:16.278
So no drooling. Unless of course
you're getting a massage.

29:16.312 --> 29:18.480
- That sounds like a fairy tale.
- But it works.

29:18.514 --> 29:23.318
We create technology to fuel scientific
progress, we're hired by biotech firms,

29:23.353 --> 29:25.220
we're constantly
challenging ourselves.

29:25.255 --> 29:28.323
- Last year, I climbed Everest.
- The actual Mountain?

29:28.358 --> 29:31.460
Yeah. But, hey, you did a really
good job replicating this.

29:31.494 --> 29:35.631
I saw the imax movie. But, if you
could be off climbing real mountains,

29:35.665 --> 29:37.499
what are you doing here
staring at a fake one?

29:37.533 --> 29:41.270
I just wanna make sure my son
is having a good time.

29:41.304 --> 29:44.039
- And he is.
- Well, he's a good kid.

29:44.073 --> 29:46.642
Thanks. He's got
kt in his blood.

29:46.676 --> 29:48.810
Here, here.

29:52.215 --> 29:53.916
Something classy for the luge?

29:57.420 --> 29:59.021
You should probably
head to the party without us.

29:59.055 --> 30:00.289
We're still waiting
on a few girls.

30:00.323 --> 30:03.258
I was hoping to get some
scantily-clad ZBZ cover

30:03.293 --> 30:05.627
so I wouldn't have to run
into heath right away.

30:05.662 --> 30:07.729
Things have been a little
bit awkward since he told me

30:07.764 --> 30:11.633
- he takes his clothes off for money.
- Heath's a stripper? Hot!

30:11.668 --> 30:14.236
I don't know.
Maybe you're right about us.

30:14.270 --> 30:18.006
I'm just not sure I wanna
give up on another relationship.

30:18.041 --> 30:22.344
I'm sorry, Cal.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.

30:22.378 --> 30:24.913
- You're completely responsible.
- Vodka?

30:28.084 --> 30:29.985
Case! What happened
to your alumni thing?

30:30.019 --> 30:32.621
Stupid ashleigh happened.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.556
Why do you have
a bottle of vodka?

30:34.590 --> 30:38.226
I... confiscated it.
Just helping out my house mom.

30:38.261 --> 30:41.697
Want some? You look like you
need a drink....

30:46.069 --> 30:49.938
Now, what happened
with ashleigh?

30:49.973 --> 30:53.175
I go out of my way
to be a good friend,

30:53.209 --> 30:56.778
and she has the gall
to attack me about my life!

30:56.813 --> 30:59.548
That's awful!

31:02.719 --> 31:06.321
She said that
I think her life is pathetic,

31:06.356 --> 31:08.190
which wasn't true,
but it is now!

31:08.224 --> 31:10.559
And that my life is so easy,

31:10.593 --> 31:12.294
and I'm living this
fairy tale... ugh!

31:12.328 --> 31:14.096
She wasn't even
making any sense!

31:14.130 --> 31:16.131
She rarely does. More?

31:16.165 --> 31:20.569
I am supposed to be the house mother.
I'm supposed to be taking care of you.

31:20.603 --> 31:25.107
We're fine, case. Relax. Let me
help you for a change. More?

31:27.643 --> 31:30.779
Maybe Ash is right.
Maybe I don't know what I'm doing.

31:30.813 --> 31:35.584
Life was so much easier when all
your decisions were made for you.

31:37.687 --> 31:41.790
I know what you mean.
Sometimes I wish I was still a pledge.

31:41.824 --> 31:44.993
I was young. Carefree.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.429
I'd go out and use
my hot body as a weapon.

31:47.463 --> 31:49.097
Yeah, because so much
has changed.

31:49.132 --> 31:52.467
Hey, it's homecoming,
and I'm having fun.

31:52.502 --> 31:54.269
Don't you deserve
to have fun, too?

31:54.303 --> 31:59.474
Yeah.
I do deserve to have fun!

32:00.877 --> 32:02.477
But right now, I deserve to...

32:03.980 --> 32:06.248
Go to the bathroom.
I have to pee.

32:11.621 --> 32:13.321
House mom's been neutralized.
Let's roll.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.996
We're surrounded by a bunch of farmhands
who can bench press each other.

32:21.030 --> 32:23.865
- What are we doing? - You're going right
through that door where the goat is.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.100
- No, what?
- Yes.

32:25.134 --> 32:26.835
Go stand over there.
All right.

32:26.869 --> 32:29.571
Uh, can I get everyone's
attention, please?

32:29.605 --> 32:33.775
Yeah. Cyprus-rhodes
football rules!

32:35.611 --> 32:37.312
Get him!

32:58.201 --> 32:59.501
This way! Let's go!

33:00.369 --> 33:02.471
- No!
- Shh! Shush!

33:02.505 --> 33:05.340
- Hey, how did you get in?
- I lost 'em.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.342
Now let's do this before
they realize we're here.

33:13.883 --> 33:14.883
Oh, no.

33:19.889 --> 33:21.356
Omega chi got here first.

33:22.172 --> 33:24.057
We took the goat.
Good luck at the game. CRU.

33:40.377 --> 33:41.444
Settle, bitch. Save some
for the rest of us.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.982
- Heather's the belle of the ball.
- You must be so proud.

33:47.918 --> 33:49.419
Cal.

33:51.755 --> 33:55.124
Ooh, right. See ya!

33:57.862 --> 34:00.029
Look, I know you're still probably
freaking out about the whole stripper,

34:00.865 --> 34:01.998
- test-seller thing.
- A little bit.

34:02.967 --> 34:04.434
I'm sorry, I just
didn't know how to react.

34:05.135 --> 34:06.169
I get it.
I should've told you.

34:07.505 --> 34:10.572
I was just afraid you'd break up
with me if you found out about it.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.244
Are you gonna break up with me?

34:15.612 --> 34:17.112
- I don't want to, heath.
- Then, don't.

34:18.181 --> 34:21.016
Look, I know you're this
smart, amazing, together guy,

34:21.385 --> 34:22.719
and I'm... me,

34:23.920 --> 34:25.955
<i>the guy who likes twilight
and the berenstain bear books.</i>

34:27.091 --> 34:29.525
But that doesn't mean we can't
enjoy being together, right?

34:30.561 --> 34:32.728
You know, I'm not as together
as you think I am.

34:34.264 --> 34:36.165
The reason I didn't tell you I didn't have
a major was because I was embarrassed.

34:37.134 --> 34:39.569
I didn't want you
to think I was a... loser.

34:40.337 --> 34:42.105
I could never think
that about you.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.806
And for the record,
I think you're a great guy.

34:46.010 --> 34:49.746
Then let's both be honest, about it all.
The good, the bad...

34:50.080 --> 34:51.447
I love you.

34:54.118 --> 34:56.920
I love you, too.

34:57.955 --> 34:59.055
Wow, this honesty thing
is awesome!

35:00.391 --> 35:06.930
Yeah, I love my big, gay,
test-selling, ex-stripper boyfriend.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.166
And I love my boyfriend
with no major.

35:11.135 --> 35:13.536
Yeah, mine's much worse.

35:15.673 --> 35:19.976
- How the hell did Dale do it? - Have I ever
told you about my irrational fear of baby cows?

35:20.377 --> 35:21.844
You mean calves?

35:23.747 --> 35:26.649
Dale must've had help.
You think he had an inside man?

35:27.818 --> 35:31.020
Rusty, they're gone.
Let's just leave before we get caught.

35:32.523 --> 35:34.023
You're right. And you're right
to want cappie as a big brother.

35:35.426 --> 35:37.026
When I was a freshman, cappie gave
men amazing college experience.

35:38.495 --> 35:43.032
You deserve that, too.
You deserve the original, not the second-rate...

35:43.934 --> 35:45.868
<i>...The remake.
The Thomas crown affair.</i>

35:46.870 --> 35:48.004
The one with Pierce Brosnan?
I kinda like that movie.

35:48.806 --> 35:51.007
Yeah, Dale was watching
that earlier.

35:52.109 --> 35:55.178
Pierce Brosnan got the
painting out of the museum...

35:55.846 --> 35:57.413
By hiding it in plain sight.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.856
Jackpot. Ok, it's ok!

36:07.124 --> 36:08.758
It's ok.

36:09.059 --> 36:10.026
Come on.

36:10.628 --> 36:11.628
Come on!

36:11.795 --> 36:13.663
Out of the way, out of the way.

36:15.265 --> 36:16.599
- Right out this door.
- Hey!

36:17.768 --> 36:18.935
- Hey, that's our goat!
- Hey, that's our goat!

36:19.603 --> 36:22.038
Get the goat!

36:27.044 --> 36:28.111
Get 'em!

36:29.380 --> 36:30.446
If you add up all
my CRU tuition money,

36:31.515 --> 36:36.452
you actually owe me, like,
thousands of gin and tonics.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.854
All right.

36:38.622 --> 36:39.055
- Whoa! Sorry.
- Oh! Oh, my God!

36:40.024 --> 36:41.157
I'm so sorry.
That was my totally my fault.

36:42.359 --> 36:46.062
- It's all right.
- Oh, you're Casey's scary Professor.

36:46.764 --> 36:49.132
- Scary?
- I mean... scary smart.

36:49.967 --> 36:52.769
Ok. Um...
Well...

36:53.637 --> 36:54.771
Whatever happened
to miss Cartwright?

36:55.539 --> 36:57.206
Um, well, we kind of
got in a fight.

36:58.575 --> 37:02.545
She wants me to take this crappy job
and face my reality, or whatever.

37:03.514 --> 37:06.282
You know, when I left
college back in 1990,

37:07.084 --> 37:08.885
- I was in construction.
- Oh, really?

37:09.820 --> 37:11.820
- I was two.
- You work construction, too?

37:11.822 --> 37:14.791
No. I was... two years old.

37:15.726 --> 37:16.959
Right. Anyway, it was
a tough time for me.

37:18.262 --> 37:21.798
I'd invested in this big education,
so why was I shoveling cement?

37:22.566 --> 37:25.334
- So, why were you?
- Survival.

37:26.570 --> 37:29.205
People who can survive are ready
when obstacles come their way.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.675
Like my father said,
"never look down into the chasm.

37:33.310 --> 37:34.377
Keep your eyes
on the horizon."

37:35.879 --> 37:38.881
He also said, "never
leave a party before the bartender."

37:39.616 --> 37:41.984
Can I buy you a drink?

37:42.519 --> 37:44.520
Yeah, I would love one.

37:45.155 --> 37:46.122
- Professor.
- Call me Simon.

37:46.790 --> 37:50.293
Ok. Simon.
Thanks.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.963
Hey, you seen cappie?
Where's cappie?

37:54.465 --> 37:56.532
- Oh, cap!
- Yo!

37:57.367 --> 38:00.036
Well? Really?

38:03.373 --> 38:04.240
Oh!

38:04.775 --> 38:06.676
- Oh, my...
- Wow.

38:07.811 --> 38:09.579
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

38:11.515 --> 38:15.318
I am proud to announce that our
very own spitter and pledge spidey

38:16.587 --> 38:20.957
have successfully stolen the a&m goat!

38:21.825 --> 38:25.495
- So? What do you think?
- Not bad, kiddo.

38:29.099 --> 38:32.969
So now that we have our pledge back, it's
time for the kt big brother ceremony!

38:38.642 --> 38:41.844
For his big brother,
pledge spidey has chosen...

38:44.681 --> 38:47.650
Rusty Cartwright.

38:49.419 --> 38:51.419
- Was this because of the goat?
- No.

38:51.555 --> 38:54.757
Cappie's cool, but you're cool,
and a nerd. You're the...

38:55.325 --> 38:56.625
- The amalgam?
- Yes!

38:57.060 --> 38:58.194
- Like I hope to be some day.
- Ah, man, that's cool.

38:59.263 --> 39:01.164
I won't let you down.
You're well on your way, pledge.

39:02.099 --> 39:03.933
- All right.
- Let's go find that ice luge.

39:04.468 --> 39:06.202
Let's get belligerent.

39:12.142 --> 39:13.209
Hey, Casey.
Looking for cappie?

39:14.378 --> 39:19.015
No, I'm looking for this.
Ooh...

39:20.150 --> 39:20.950
- Hey, someone turn
the music back on! - Wow.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.787
Gettinthis, man?

39:25.522 --> 39:27.123
They're gonna be so mad.
What's up?

39:28.325 --> 39:31.327
Suck on this, a&m! I'm sending
this to collegepartymonster.org.

39:31.829 --> 39:33.329
Oh, that's a good one.

39:34.231 --> 39:35.865
I love your mouth right now!

39:37.501 --> 39:39.735
I really need a boyfriend, asap.

39:40.604 --> 39:42.238
I already have one,
so why am I here?

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
I'm not this person anymore.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.342
I'm gonna go see
my awesome boyfriend.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.946
I'm gonna go
cry myself to sleep.

39:54.818 --> 39:57.019
Wow! That doesn't go down
like it used to.

39:57.921 --> 40:00.723
Oh, you're doing fine.
Wow...

40:01.558 --> 40:01.858
- How do you do it, anyway?
- What?

40:03.160 --> 40:06.028
How does a middle-aged man drink
really cheap Tequila without dying?

40:06.997 --> 40:11.701
No, how do you exist
in the real world without...

40:12.636 --> 40:14.237
Yes, dying, inside.
Metaphorically speaking.

40:15.372 --> 40:19.542
Cappie, the real world is
just a place with people in it.

40:20.077 --> 40:21.277
It's not out to get you.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.880
You're smart,
you know who you are.

40:24.681 --> 40:25.948
So have a little faith
in yourself, ok?

40:27.017 --> 40:30.486
Here is my card. Whenever you
do leave this backyard,

40:31.121 --> 40:32.621
it'd be good to have a friend.

40:32.656 --> 40:37.460
Think of me as your
real world big brother.

40:45.903 --> 40:46.569
Casey?

40:48.071 --> 40:52.241
- What are you doing here? - I'm having fun.
What's it look like, slappy?

40:53.443 --> 40:55.711
- Maybe you're having too much fun.
- I deserve this.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.880
Even Rebecca agrees.
Now, where's the keg?

40:58.982 --> 41:00.716
Ok, no more kegs.
Let me take you home. Come on.

41:01.485 --> 41:03.853
- Oh, come on.
- No, no. Come on.

41:04.187 --> 41:05.955
Oh, fine.

41:16.266 --> 41:19.502
Wow, I cannot believe you wasted
that outfit on a kt party.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.103
How was it?

41:22.005 --> 41:23.973
- Heather did not disappoint.
- Mm-hmm.

41:25.108 --> 41:29.879
- But... I missed my boyfriend.
- I missed my girlfriend.

41:33.317 --> 41:36.619
- How was your night?
- It was incredible.

41:38.221 --> 41:40.122
- That's great. - Yeah.
Segal and I bro'd out like crazy.

41:41.358 --> 41:43.326
He even introduced me to an
Ohio state supreme court judge.

41:44.594 --> 41:46.629
I felt like a
real lawyer the whole night.

41:47.898 --> 41:51.367
Hm. Maybe we can play a little
lawyer interrogating his witness.

41:52.469 --> 41:57.506
Uh, not tonight,
babe. I'm just so exhausted.

41:58.175 --> 42:00.576
You mind if we just go to bed?

42:10.887 --> 42:12.121
Ash? I thought
of another thing!

42:13.190 --> 42:16.425
- Ok, whoa, whoa. Come on.
- Whoa. She's not here.

42:16.994 --> 42:17.893
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

42:18.562 --> 42:20.196
There we go.

42:31.708 --> 42:32.808
Wait.

42:40.517 --> 42:42.485
Wh...?

42:49.760 --> 42:52.395
- We can't. We're drunk.
- Shh...

42:56.533 --> 42:59.368
What are we doing?
What is this?

43:01.004 --> 43:03.072
It's a fairy tale.
