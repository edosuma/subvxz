Nah. Must have been another
handsome guy with great hair.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.797
I wouldn't say that, no.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.133
-Come on in, Glen.
-It's Ben.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.843
-Ben?
-It's Ben.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.595
Well, let's compromise.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.138
Pete. Come on in, Pete.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.976
[vocalizing]

12:54.565 --> 12:56.484
Kimmy, what are all the medical files
doing out?

12:56.901 --> 13:00.446
Oh, I've reorganized all the pets
according to adorability.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.698
Obviously, Cosmo's the cutest,

13:02.823 --> 13:05.034
and then it works
all the way down to Muffin,

13:05.367 --> 13:06.952
with the unfortunate underbite.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.836
Uh, Kimmy, you...
you can't change the filing system.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.963
Matt and I like things the way they are.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.759
You need to get out of your comfort zone.
A to Z is so last year.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.307
Sharon, this will be a day
you will never forget.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.100
What's going on?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.853
Schlomo is turning 13,

13:32.937 --> 13:36.232
so we're throwing him a "bark mitzvah"
here on Saturday.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.611
Oh, look at this shayna punim. Oh!

13:42.112 --> 13:44.532
Bye, Schlomo. Mazel tov.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.616
See you Saturday.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.662
Saturday? Kimmy, that's our busiest day.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.081
Oh, don't worry,
I canceled all of your appointments.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.960
We can't have customers
blocking the ice cream sundae bar.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.172
No, Kimmy, we can't close for a dog party.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.091
It's totally worth it.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.968
It will be excellent word-of-mouth.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.929
I promise it will be
the "bark mitzvah" of the century.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.889
The Goldsteins are gonna plotz.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.477
-Hey, Deej.
-Hi.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.271
How's Comet Jr., Jr.?

14:15.354 --> 14:17.481
She's great.
Dipped, dried, and ready to go.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.733
Yo, Steve-O.
Hey, Deej, I've got a question.

14:19.817 --> 14:24.613
Did you know that we are hosting something
called a "bark mitzvah" this Saturday?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.240
Oh, good, the Evite went out.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.034
I'm a definite yes.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.537
Comet Jr., Jr. will not leave
the dance floor.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.789
I'll update the guest list.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.549
Yeah, that is Kimmy making great happen.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.386
Deej, we are overworked as it is.
Now we're hosting parties for dogs?

14:47.469 --> 14:49.346
No, it's totally worth it.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.931
It's excellent word-of-mouth,

14:51.015 --> 14:54.143
and I promise, it will be
the "bark mitzvah" of the century.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.562
The Goldsteins are gonna plotz!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.690
Oy vey, I'm shvitzing already.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.066
Next!

15:03.277 --> 15:05.404
So, uh, Kimmy's working here?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.323
How's that going?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.575
-It's great. It's great.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.327
-That bad, huh?
-Worse.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.206
That makes sense 'cause Kimmy is,
you know, Kimmy.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.585
Kimmy's my best friend.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.337
I mean, I can't get rid of her and...

15:21.712 --> 15:24.256
Besides, she's only had one boss
who hasn't fired her.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.883
-Who's that?
-Herself.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.095
I just-- I can't let her go.
She would be devastated,

15:30.179 --> 15:31.931
and I can't do that to her.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.058
[phone ringing]

15:34.767 --> 15:35.726
Kimmy!

15:38.938 --> 15:40.064
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.066
What are you doing answering the phones?

15:42.149 --> 15:46.236
Oh. Well, Saturday,
a dog's becoming a man, and it's...

15:46.320 --> 15:48.072
Long story. What's up, Steph?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.450
I've really slacked off
in the fiancée department.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.577
I want Jimmy to know how much I care.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.664
You just need to make him feel special.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.958
When was the last time you made dinner?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.335
When I drove a car through the kitchen.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.171
Yeah, don't do that.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.216
But do make him dinner.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.308
[Jesse hums, imitates rattle]

16:16.642 --> 16:17.685
What do ya got?

16:19.269 --> 16:21.230
Well, we've come to a conclusion.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.314
You found the biter?

16:22.398 --> 16:23.232
No.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.818
But we found out it's not easy
taking a cookie from a kid.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.073
And we also found out
that none of the kids

16:31.156 --> 16:32.866
match the bite marks on Pamela's arm.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.203
There's five cookies here
and there's six kids.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.288
What kind of shoddy detective work
is this?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.916
The kind that's free and against our will.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.877
Okay, I'll take care of this myself.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.423
Hi, kids, which one of you
didn't get a cookie, huh?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.299
Cookie? Cookie? Cookie?
Cookie? Cookie? Cookie?

16:49.883 --> 16:53.012
Not for Finn, because he knows better
than to have processed sugar.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.096
Oh.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.391
You're one of those
hipster helicopter parents, I got it.

16:59.393 --> 17:03.522
Finn, how would you like
a nice, sweet apple slice?

17:03.897 --> 17:05.149
Is it organic, or...

17:05.482 --> 17:07.234
Yeah, let's go with that. Sure.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.362
Did I say "organic"?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.865
I meant it's lathered in
bug-killing chemicals.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.286
-That was close. Good looking out.
-Yeah. Hey.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.539
Where's Pamela?

17:20.622 --> 17:22.166
In the kitchen watching Aunt Steph cook.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.250
Okay.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.710
Aunt Steph's cooking?

17:25.335 --> 17:26.628
Thank God I parked in front.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.089
Hey. [stammers]

17:35.345 --> 17:36.513
Why are you dressed like that?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.891
Why are you snatching cookies
from children?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.895
I am trying to solve a crime.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.730
I think you're committing one.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.736
Let me just see this real fast.

17:50.819 --> 17:51.779
Let me see here.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.698
Ah-ha!

17:56.033 --> 17:59.161
A perfect match.  We got ourselves
a biter. Come on, come on.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.665
You're going down Glen, or Gwen,
or whatever your name is.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.335
Hey, Pocket Papa, get your app over here.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.422
'Sup, bro?

18:11.131 --> 18:12.800
Your son bit my daughter.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.594
Are you sure?
He doesn't have a history of biting.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.472
Misusing gender pronouns, sure,
but biting, no.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.060
The bite mark on this apple
matches perfectly with the bite mark

18:23.143 --> 18:24.728
that my daughter got yesterday at school.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.438
-Oh, that's not possible.
-Why?

18:26.522 --> 18:29.399
Because you gluten-intolerant,
participation-trophy-givin'...

18:29.483 --> 18:31.819
-No. He couldn't have.
-...third-party-- He couldn't have?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.779
Any problem with your kid is somehow
our problem?

18:33.862 --> 18:36.740
No, he wasn't at school.
We were at Disneyland!

18:39.910 --> 18:41.370
-What?
-I know.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.914
I know. I gave my money
to a faceless corporate conglomerate.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.165
I'm so ashamed.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.752
-You were at Disneyland?
-We had a great time. I had a churro.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.087
Be better, Ben!

18:51.797 --> 18:54.091
Wait a minute, if your kid
didn't bite my kid, then who did?

18:55.050 --> 18:55.968
Oh.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.053
Pamela, what are you doing?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.681
Why are you biting yourself?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.182
I like Band-Aids.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.185
You like Band-Aids?
That's why you were biting yourself? Oh.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.772
Sweetie, just ask for a Band-Aid.
I'll give you a hundred Band-Aids.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.941
Please don't bite yourself anymore.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.067
Okay, Daddy.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.122
Ben, is it?

19:26.165 --> 19:29.668
Do you have something to say
about us new age hipster parents?

19:29.751 --> 19:33.213
Yes, I'm sorry for being the jerk
that I thought you were.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.382
I forgive you.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.926
Because forgiveness is a hug
you give to your soul.

19:38.010 --> 19:38.886
Mm-hmm.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.139
Now, how about a real one, bud?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.017
Well, the soul hug was enough, wasn't it?
No?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.819
This is why I never called you back.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.448
[vocalizing]

20:02.034 --> 20:04.203
-Honey, you're home!
-[Jimmy] Wow.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.413
This is quite a welcome.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.916
Wait, why are you wearing that?

20:11.627 --> 20:12.669
Is it Halloween?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.296
Am I dying? Who's dying?

20:15.923 --> 20:18.050
Honey, nobody is dying.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.509
I'm just happy you're home.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.637
Now, have a seat.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.555
I've got all of your favorites.

20:24.473 --> 20:29.061
Fried chicken, Sunny D,
and even a word jumble.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.312
Oh, wow.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.065
This is amazing,
or as word jumble would say,

20:33.148 --> 20:34.107
"Zingama."

20:36.151 --> 20:39.821
I even did some laundry today and you'll
never guess what I stumbled across.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.575
The baseball T-shirt that you were wearing
the first time we kissed.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.578
What? I've been looking for that
for months. How did you find it?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.997
Well, turns out I stole it from you.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.002
But I'm so considerate that I returned it,
washed and ready to go.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.922
Oh, my gosh, Stephanie, you're the best!

20:57.839 --> 20:58.966
Ta-da!

21:02.761 --> 21:03.887
Oh, no.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.306
I must have shrunk it in the dryer.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.976
Oh, I can't do anything right.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.312
Oh, no, no, it's okay.
I'm sure it will stretch. Let me just...

21:12.396 --> 21:14.398
give it the old Jimmy try here.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.111
Um...

21:19.486 --> 21:20.862
Yeah, it's perfect.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.826
I, uh, I liked it as a shirt,
but I love it as a hat.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.830
I'm sorry I ruined it.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.416
But I do have one more
surprise for you.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.251
I made you a very special dessert.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.795
-Oh, pie?
-No.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.838
Mud pie?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.464
-No.
-Apple crumble?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.716
I'm gonna get the cake.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.387
Ooh, I made it just for you.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.097
It is red velvet.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.474
Now,
you know I'm allergic to red food dye?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.853
Of course. That's why this one
is completely organic and dye-free.

21:52.936 --> 21:53.937
[Jimmy] Ah!

21:55.897 --> 21:56.732
Mmm!

21:57.399 --> 21:59.693
Delicious.
How'd you get it red without the dye?

21:59.776 --> 22:00.736
I used beets.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.738
Oh.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.906
I'm very allergic to beets.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.454
Maybe that's why I can't feel
the left side of my face.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.873
[stammering]
You can't feel your what?

22:12.956 --> 22:14.499
[slurring]
Oh, there goes the other side.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.211
No, no, no, Jimmy, just put it down.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.005
[slurred] But you made it with love.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.510
[phone ringing]

22:27.179 --> 22:28.680
Kimmy, can you answer the...

22:28.764 --> 22:29.931
[phone continues ringing]

22:31.558 --> 22:33.602
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care,
can you please hold?

22:34.811 --> 22:37.230
-Kimmy?
-[Matt] Kimmy, can you grab Buster's file?

22:37.314 --> 22:39.483
You bet she can!

22:47.407 --> 22:48.325
Kimmy!

22:49.743 --> 22:50.702
Hey, Deej.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.289
I'm drumming up more customers
with my sweet sign-spinning skills.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.877
[groans] You are killing me, Gibbler.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.464
What's happening? Where's Kimmy?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.882
Um, she's...

23:04.633 --> 23:08.720
she's in the bathroom crying
because you are not being very supportive,

23:08.804 --> 23:12.224
and she cares so much.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.185
Is that her in a dog suit spinning a sign?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.650
If you're wearing a dog suit,
you gotta spin something, right?

23:22.359 --> 23:24.528
Deej, come on.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.489
We all love Kimmy,
but you know this isn't working out.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.866
Yeah, fine.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.743
I know, I'll take care of it.
You were right.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.995
[gasps] Yes, I knew it.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.165
It only took five years,
but DJ Fuller said I was right.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.333
[Matt chuckles]

23:38.417 --> 23:39.459
Ooh.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.378
Gia owes me 20 bucks.

23:42.963 --> 23:43.880
Come on.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.136
Kimmy!

23:49.761 --> 23:50.637
Can we talk?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.432
Oh, sure. I could use a bowl of water.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.272
What's up, Deej?

24:00.772 --> 24:02.732
I have good news for you.

24:02.816 --> 24:06.319
You are too talented for this place.
We do not deserve you.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.363
Oh, no.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.450
That's what they said when they canned me
at Hot Dog on a Stick.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.952
You're firing me.

24:14.035 --> 24:18.790
No, no, I'm setting you free to pursue
greater opportunities.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.460
That's what they said
at Bed Bath & Beyond

24:21.543 --> 24:24.796
when they told me to go
beyond the entrance and never come back.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.635
Why can't I keep a job
for even one day?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.971
Because you're Kimmy.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.016
You weren't meant to have a regular job.
You were meant...

24:36.475 --> 24:38.935
to be your own self-employed
party planner.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.521
I have been pretty successful.

24:42.189 --> 24:47.235
The things that make you not so good here
are what make you great in your real job.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.613
Now that you mention it,

24:49.696 --> 24:53.450
I have been suffocating
in this rigid corporate environment.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.079
You're not a filer or a phone answerer.

24:58.163 --> 25:02.959
You are a dog-suit-wearing,
party-planning boss lady.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.003
That's me in a nutshell.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.215
But you were still willing to help me out,

25:08.298 --> 25:10.091
and that's why you're my best friend.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.302
Thanks, Deej.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.263
You're a wonderful friend, too.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.264
[phone ringing]

25:16.348 --> 25:19.017
-Want me to get that for old times' sake?
-No.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.356
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.066
Steph?

25:26.149 --> 25:27.817
[gasps] I'll be right there.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.987
-I'll be back as soon as I can.
-What's wrong?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.280
Stephanie tried to cook.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.833
Hey, Steph, we got here soon as we could.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.502
Oh, thank you. This is so nice of you,

25:45.585 --> 25:47.087
but you guys both didn't have to come.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.631
Oh, it's okay. I had to get out of
a weird playdate, anyway.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.010
You know, in a past life,
I was an ER doctor, so...

25:55.929 --> 25:56.888
How's Jimmy?

25:57.222 --> 26:00.225
[stammers] He's fine.
They're taping up his toe right now.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.726
It's just a minor fracture.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.729
Wait, a fracture?
I thought you poisoned him.

26:06.523 --> 26:09.109
Well, Benadryl took care of that, but...

26:09.568 --> 26:12.320
when I was rushing to get it,
I knocked over a chair and broke his toe.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.532
You are literally loving him to death.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.285
I know.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.245
He deserves better.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.956
Just... I have so much on my plate
right now, you know,

26:23.039 --> 26:25.542
with the baby and my music career.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.128
I feel like Jimmy's getting lost
in the shuffle.

26:28.795 --> 26:32.549
That's just part of being a couple.
You always wonder if you're doing enough.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.051
I just messed it all up.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.347
I don't know, maybe I'm just not good
at taking care of people.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.933
What are you talking about?

26:42.892 --> 26:45.186
You gave up your whole life

26:45.270 --> 26:49.399
to come and move in and take care of me
and the kids when I needed you the most.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.361
So, you're saying there's still hope
for me yet?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.196
Oh, come on. Jimmy adores you.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.866
You see the way he looks at you
when you hold that baby?

26:59.909 --> 27:00.744
He's right.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.540
Steph, before I met you,

27:05.624 --> 27:09.127
I was just living in an RV
in a Walmart parking lot,

27:09.210 --> 27:11.004
eating nothing but french fries.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.965
And now, my life is even better.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.428
I've got a baby, a fiancée, a home,

27:18.720 --> 27:22.140
and a business,
and that's... that's all because of you.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.017
Oh.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.895
You said I'm better than
french fries. [chuckles]

27:28.772 --> 27:31.191
Hey, maybe that's what makes us work.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.194
It's that we're both just so happy
to have found each other.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.196
Mmm.

27:38.948 --> 27:39.908
I love you, Jimmy.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.701
I love you too, Steph.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.580
[DJ, Jesse] Aww.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.167
You get the feeling we should have left
a while ago?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.251
One hundred percent.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.178
All right, come on, ladies
and Uncle Jesse. Don't slow down.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.430
We have to eat this cake
before Jimmy does.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.723
For Jimmy!

28:05.058 --> 28:07.102
See, Steph,
this was very thoughtful of you.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.436
[Jesse] Mm-hmm.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.523
Jimmy is very lucky to have you.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.028
And I'm lucky to have a friend
who isn't afraid to tell me the truth.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.698
Aww, so no hard feelings about today?

28:19.781 --> 28:20.740
Not at all.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.285
I talked Schlomo's family into moving
the "bark mitzvah" to his house,

28:24.369 --> 28:25.829
so I still got the job.

28:27.914 --> 28:31.626
Well, I guess I gotta get used
to this new school style of parenting.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.086
You know, you were right, DJ.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.338
I should have done the opposite
of everything that I did.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.590
Yeah, but that's what makes you you.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.634
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.553
I am perfect.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.640
[DJ, Stephanie, Kimmy] Meh.
