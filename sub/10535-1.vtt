Another Terry Leather
low-mileage gem.

01:49.916 --> 01:52.251
Got your glad rags sorted out
for your wedding tomorrow?

01:52.293 --> 01:54.378
Yeah, course, Terry. New suit...

01:54.420 --> 01:56.255
two buttons,
nine-inch bum flaps.

01:56.297 --> 01:58.591
Nice. Ingrid will like that.

01:59.759 --> 02:01.594
So you're getting
married tomorrow, Ingrid?

02:01.636 --> 02:03.721
I hope so.

02:03.763 --> 02:05.681
Go on. Get off home.
Go and make yourself

02:05.765 --> 02:07.475
look more beautiful
than you already are.

02:08.935 --> 02:10.436
If that's possible.

02:11.521 --> 02:12.980
Terry.

02:13.064 --> 02:15.525
Promise you won't get Eddie
too legless tonight, will ya?

02:15.608 --> 02:17.527
- At his stag do.
- Just going round to pub.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.070
Couple of pints and a sing-song.

02:35.711 --> 02:37.713
Fucking what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

02:38.798 --> 02:40.174
I've got Jessell's money!

02:41.259 --> 02:43.302
The problem is
it's tied up in these cars

02:43.344 --> 02:45.054
and you wankers want
to trash the lot of them.

02:45.096 --> 02:47.557
Mr. Jessell doesn't care
about your inventory.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.517
Mr. Jessell wants to know
when he's getting paid.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.144
Any day, I swear, Perky.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.481
- What did you call me?
- I called you Perky, Perky.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.276
Everyone calls you Perky
and him Pinky.

02:58.359 --> 03:00.319
- Pinky and Perky?
- Yeah.

03:00.403 --> 03:02.113
They're fucking cartoon pigs
on the telly.

03:02.196 --> 03:04.157
What, people call us that
behind our backs?

03:04.198 --> 03:05.950
Well, they're not gonna
say it to your face, are they?

03:05.992 --> 03:07.535
Well, you just bloody did.

03:09.036 --> 03:11.706
Yeah, well, you got me rattled.

03:11.789 --> 03:13.332
You're very intimidating.

03:19.964 --> 03:21.716
Don't make us come back again.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.602
Not every customer's
a satisfied customer.

03:34.645 --> 03:36.439
What are you doing
around here, Martine?

03:36.522 --> 03:38.149
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

03:39.609 --> 03:41.819
Tonight Eddie's stag do.
I'm taking him out for a drink.

03:41.861 --> 03:44.947
- Why?
- I've got a proposition for you, Terry.

03:45.031 --> 03:46.657
A proposition?

03:46.741 --> 03:48.951
Can you meet me at the Player's Club
before you see the boys?

03:48.951 --> 03:51.245
And I'll fill you in on the details.

03:51.287 --> 03:52.789
Make it 9:00.

03:57.168 --> 03:59.086
- Morning, Gale.
- Morning, Tim.

03:59.128 --> 04:00.671
Top floor.

04:00.755 --> 04:03.382
- Summoned by the gods?
- Something like that.

04:03.466 --> 04:05.259
Get up to any mischief
this weekend?

04:05.301 --> 04:06.803
Don't know
what you're talking about.

04:06.886 --> 04:08.763
I'm a married man.

04:10.389 --> 04:12.809
What do you think,
am I presentable?

04:12.892 --> 04:15.311
Not sure about the tie, darling.

04:15.394 --> 04:16.853
Oh, what's this?

04:16.938 --> 04:18.648
Peace and love?

04:18.731 --> 04:20.858
Too much of that nonsense,
we'll both be out of a job.

04:22.735 --> 04:25.696
Michael Abdul Malik.

04:25.738 --> 04:28.491
Calls himself "Michael X"
in homage to Malcolm X,

04:28.533 --> 04:30.326
his American counterpart.

04:30.368 --> 04:32.161
The pinko press
would have us believe

04:32.245 --> 04:34.205
this... Michael X

04:34.247 --> 04:36.707
is a crusading champion
of the poor and oppressed.

04:36.791 --> 04:39.418
And the black Robin Hood
of Notting Hill.

04:39.502 --> 04:41.379
The richer, whiter
and more famous,

04:41.462 --> 04:42.922
the more they fawn over him.

04:43.005 --> 04:44.715
The truth is,
he's a slum landlord,

04:44.799 --> 04:46.259
a drug dealer and a vicious pimp

04:46.342 --> 04:47.927
who should have been
imprisoned years go.

04:49.804 --> 04:51.514
Are you not charging
outrageous rent

04:51.597 --> 04:54.600
to my brothers and sisters,
Mr. Brown?

04:54.684 --> 04:57.770
I'm charging the same as your
slumlord friend, Lew Vogel.

04:57.854 --> 05:00.022
10 quid a week is too much
for this shithole.

05:01.899 --> 05:03.443
You know...

05:03.526 --> 05:05.153
I always wanted to meet a white man

05:05.236 --> 05:07.572
by the name of Brown.

05:08.823 --> 05:11.159
You know what this is?

05:11.242 --> 05:13.578
It is a slave collar,
and the white man

05:13.619 --> 05:15.371
made my mothers and fathers

05:15.455 --> 05:17.457
wear this to bend them
to his will.

05:20.751 --> 05:24.213
Can I bend you
to my will, Mr. Brown?

05:24.297 --> 05:26.382
He's your faithful dog
now, Michael.

05:29.135 --> 05:32.263
Michael, I don't think we should
get our hopes up here.

05:32.346 --> 05:33.723
Kidnapping, extortion,

05:33.806 --> 05:35.391
assault on this man Brown here,

05:35.475 --> 05:37.727
as well as your previous
problems with the law...

05:37.810 --> 05:40.605
I mean, you could be looking
at 10 to 20 years for this.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.649
I don't think so. I am smarter

05:43.733 --> 05:45.568
and better protected
than whitey thinks.

05:45.651 --> 05:47.278
All rise.

05:49.739 --> 05:53.201
It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail

05:53.284 --> 05:55.912
by threatening to release
damning photographs

05:55.995 --> 05:58.831
of a certain royal personage.

06:03.669 --> 06:06.506
Until we get our hands
on these snaps, the police can't move.

06:06.589 --> 06:08.007
The public prosecutor won't move

06:08.049 --> 06:09.842
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

06:09.884 --> 06:11.636
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

06:11.677 --> 06:15.515
Yes. But at the moment
I'm not at the liberty

06:15.556 --> 06:17.391
to say who that person is.

06:17.475 --> 06:20.186
We've had Michael X under
surveillance for quite a while.

06:20.269 --> 06:22.855
He keeps a safe deposit box
at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone.

06:22.939 --> 06:25.441
We believe that's
where the photos are located.

06:26.818 --> 06:29.612
Well, seems
straightforward enough.

06:29.695 --> 06:31.531
I'll send a team into this bank

06:31.572 --> 06:33.282
and take whatever he's got
in the safe deposit box.

06:33.282 --> 06:35.910
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level.

06:35.993 --> 06:39.122
- And that's not going to happen.
- Ah.

06:39.205 --> 06:41.290
Do you see our problem?

06:41.374 --> 06:43.793
There can be
no connection to 506.

06:43.876 --> 06:46.045
So you want me
to come up with something

06:46.087 --> 06:48.172
that avoids any
accountability for anyone.

06:48.256 --> 06:50.424
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

06:50.508 --> 06:52.927
And if it all goes pear-shaped,

06:52.969 --> 06:54.595
I assume it's my ass on the line.

06:54.679 --> 06:56.264
You're young and ambitious, Tim.

06:56.347 --> 06:59.392
Chance to make
a name for yourself.

06:59.434 --> 07:00.935
Thank you, sir.

07:01.102 --> 07:04.856
Passengers arriving on flight 47...

07:08.067 --> 07:10.319
Excuse me there, miss.
Can I have a word?

07:10.403 --> 07:12.280
Yes.

07:12.321 --> 07:14.740
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

07:17.577 --> 07:19.662
I'll have to check
your underwear.

07:19.745 --> 07:21.330
Be my guest.

07:22.415 --> 07:24.417
- We found what we were looking for.
- Found what?

07:24.500 --> 07:26.502
What were you looking for?

07:29.088 --> 07:31.424
Oh, Tim, thank God.

07:31.507 --> 07:33.009
I'm in a spot of bother.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.263
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

07:37.346 --> 07:39.265
I was in Morocco recently.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.310
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

07:43.436 --> 07:45.062
Drinks are on me.

07:47.148 --> 07:51.027
So are we gonna sit here all night
making small talk?

07:52.570 --> 07:54.113
I know you, Terry.

07:54.197 --> 07:56.365
And I know your mates.

07:56.449 --> 07:58.493
You've always been looking
for the big score,

07:58.576 --> 08:00.661
the one that makes
sense of everything.

08:01.996 --> 08:04.499
I have it for you.

08:04.582 --> 08:07.210
- What?
- A bank.

08:08.419 --> 08:10.213
A bank? As in rob?

08:13.382 --> 08:15.551
How would you know about a bank?

08:15.635 --> 08:18.012
I've been seeing this guy,
runs his own business...

08:18.054 --> 08:20.515
security systems.

08:20.556 --> 08:24.143
Next month, they're installing
new alarms at a bank in Marylebone.

08:24.227 --> 08:26.687
Seems like the trains have been
setting off the trembler alarms

08:26.729 --> 08:28.773
in the vault
and they've had to turn them off.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.734
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

08:33.653 --> 08:35.696
Now why would he tell you all this?

08:36.780 --> 08:38.616
We were having a laugh about it.

08:38.698 --> 08:42.410
"Imagine if half the villains in London
knew about this," he said.

08:42.495 --> 08:45.373
And I thought, "I know
half the villains in London."

08:45.456 --> 08:47.500
I grew up with some of them."

08:47.583 --> 08:49.585
Look, me and my mates
might have been involved

08:49.669 --> 08:51.754
with the odd bit of skullduggery,

08:51.796 --> 08:54.924
but can you see us tooled up
taking on a bank like the James gang?

08:55.007 --> 08:57.760
No, this isn't about waving
a water pistol at a cashier's head.

08:57.844 --> 09:01.389
This is about getting into the basement
where the deposit boxes are...

09:01.472 --> 09:03.599
hidden, secret wealth.

09:03.683 --> 09:05.726
Money and jewels
that are safe to steal

09:05.810 --> 09:07.270
'cause people won't report it.

09:07.353 --> 09:10.898
Hold on, hold on.
We can't talk about this here.

09:10.982 --> 09:13.609
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.111
We can't pass it up.

09:17.530 --> 09:20.658
I didn't expect this
from you tonight, Martine.

09:20.741 --> 09:22.994
What did you expect?

09:30.418 --> 09:32.044
I'll have to think about it.

09:33.421 --> 09:36.048
Better get off to your stag party.

09:36.132 --> 09:37.842
Thanks for the drink.

09:42.054 --> 09:44.223
Eddie tells me his brother
invited you to the wedding.

09:45.558 --> 09:47.143
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

09:57.904 --> 09:59.947
- Can I get a Campari and soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

10:05.661 --> 10:08.539
Thank you. Well, Tim sweetie,
what do you think?

10:09.582 --> 10:11.125
Is he up for it?

10:11.209 --> 10:12.919
Maybe.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.545
Cheers, gorgeous.

10:35.441 --> 10:38.069
- So, are you coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

10:38.152 --> 10:41.572
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

10:41.656 --> 10:43.157
I guess I've got time.

10:59.298 --> 11:01.008
What exactly do you do?

11:02.301 --> 11:03.970
Bit of this, bit of that.

11:04.053 --> 11:05.680
How did you and Hakim meet?

11:05.763 --> 11:08.516
I met Hakim in Los Angeles last spring.

11:08.599 --> 11:10.768
He was raising money
for a black Montessori school

11:10.852 --> 11:12.395
and writing his life story.

11:12.478 --> 11:15.481
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

11:15.565 --> 11:19.277
The book is called "From the Dead Level:
Malcolm X and Me."

11:19.360 --> 11:22.113
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet,

11:22.196 --> 11:23.823
the voice of the black soul.

11:23.865 --> 11:26.367
Our friend is throwing a thing
next week to celebrate

11:26.409 --> 11:27.910
the launch of brother Hakim's book.

11:27.994 --> 11:30.163
And you are all invited.

11:30.246 --> 11:32.832
Hakim, tell us more
about your book.

11:35.918 --> 11:38.254
It's about being born
black in America.

11:38.337 --> 11:41.507
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

11:43.885 --> 11:47.472
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

11:47.555 --> 11:49.474
to bring a black baby
into this world?

12:16.626 --> 12:18.753
Evening, sir.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.260
Go on! Come on!

12:29.514 --> 12:30.973
Yeah!

12:32.016 --> 12:33.184
What are you thinking?

12:33.267 --> 12:35.269
Why are we even
having this conversation?

12:35.353 --> 12:36.479
We're not...

12:36.562 --> 12:38.272
Here's your beer.

12:41.609 --> 12:43.236
We are not bank robbers.

12:43.319 --> 12:45.655
Maybe that's why we could
get away with it.

12:45.696 --> 12:47.949
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

12:48.032 --> 12:49.492
Do you know what scares me more?

12:49.575 --> 12:51.536
Living and dying
with nothing to show for it.

12:53.329 --> 12:55.998
Do you know how old Mozart was
when he composed his first minuet?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.542
- No.
- Five.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.210
Five... a fucking minuet.

12:59.293 --> 13:01.254
And how would
you know that fact, Terry?

13:01.337 --> 13:04.757
Because it's tattooed
on that stripper's ass, Kevin.

13:04.841 --> 13:06.634
What the fuck's it matter how I know?

13:06.717 --> 13:09.011
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

13:09.053 --> 13:11.347
What I'm trying to say is,
it's time we stop fucking about

13:11.389 --> 13:13.349
and stop picking the shit
from under our fingernails.

13:13.391 --> 13:15.685
Shtum, lads. Coppers at 12:00.

13:31.117 --> 13:33.453
Oh, what are you two
doing here personally?

13:33.536 --> 13:36.497
I thought you were way past
being your own bagman, Gerry.

13:36.581 --> 13:39.250
Your associate, Sonia Bern,
has raised prices

13:39.333 --> 13:41.127
at that knocking shop of hers.

13:41.210 --> 13:43.754
- 120 quid, up from 100.
- And your point?

13:43.796 --> 13:46.716
A rising tide lifts all ships, mate.

13:46.799 --> 13:49.594
I think we're owed some money.

13:49.635 --> 13:52.305
- 'Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you'd do that, wouldn't you?

13:52.305 --> 13:54.015
You'd kill the goose
that lays your golden egg.

13:54.056 --> 13:55.725
Well, that would be dumb,
wouldn't it?

13:55.808 --> 13:58.352
But then again, everyone knows
coppers are dumb.

13:59.812 --> 14:01.898
Well, you can do
one thing for me.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.068
You can stop your colleagues

14:06.152 --> 14:08.488
from having their
boys' night out in my clubs.

14:11.866 --> 14:14.660
They're loud, they're lewd

14:14.744 --> 14:16.621
and they expect free oral sex.

14:16.662 --> 14:18.581
Do you know what?
That's disgusting.

14:18.664 --> 14:20.625
I mean, most of them
have families.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.587
We'll pass the word along.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.520
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies

14:40.561 --> 14:42.355
to go and find
their perks elsewhere.

14:42.396 --> 14:44.023
No one's gonna bother me.

14:44.065 --> 14:47.693
My patrons could have a lot of these
bent coppers put out to pasture.

14:47.735 --> 14:49.821
Well, I say spread the wealth around
and keep the peace.

14:49.862 --> 14:52.156
Five quid a week extra.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.242
That's all it's worth.

14:54.325 --> 14:56.077
I'll pass it on.

15:06.921 --> 15:09.340
Drysdale.

15:09.423 --> 15:10.842
Urquhart.

15:12.635 --> 15:14.595
Lord Drysdale,

15:14.637 --> 15:17.390
can I offer you a drink
before your session?

15:17.432 --> 15:18.933
Very kind of you, Sonia.

15:21.436 --> 15:22.895
Good to see you.

15:22.937 --> 15:24.647
As well, Urquhart, as well.

15:31.779 --> 15:33.739
Good girl.

15:35.575 --> 15:37.827
Tighter! Yes.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.412
That's a good girl.

15:40.955 --> 15:42.748
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

15:42.832 --> 15:44.459
You have been
a very naughty boy.

16:00.057 --> 16:02.852
Louder. Louder!

16:16.199 --> 16:19.535
- I can't.
- Come on.

16:19.577 --> 16:21.204
Give him a snog, Ingrid!

16:30.171 --> 16:31.672
Come on.

16:31.756 --> 16:33.549
Nice work, Eddie! Nice work.

16:39.764 --> 16:42.558
- Hello.
- Saw you in a magazine the other day...

16:42.600 --> 16:44.435
Campari ad on the beach.

16:44.519 --> 16:46.270
- Nice.
- Must have been an old one.

16:46.354 --> 16:48.481
- I'm not modeling anymore.
- I don't know why.

16:49.774 --> 16:52.443
- Still a knockout.
- What are you doing these days, Dave?

16:52.527 --> 16:55.738
Me? Bit of film work.

16:55.822 --> 16:57.573
- Extra, you know.
- And you, Kevin?

16:57.615 --> 16:59.283
You're still snapping, I see.

16:59.367 --> 17:01.661
The wedding photos... no no.
It's just a favor for the family.

17:01.661 --> 17:04.122
Fashion's my game,
fashion and passports.

17:04.163 --> 17:06.207
And the odd snap
of a wayward husband.

17:06.290 --> 17:09.252
- Thank you, Dave.
- So what's the verdict, boys?

17:10.336 --> 17:11.963
We're interested.

17:12.046 --> 17:13.881
First thing we should do
is take a look at the place,

17:13.923 --> 17:16.217
suss it out,
maybe open a box of our own.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.886
I've already done that.
We can go and have a look tomorrow.

17:20.847 --> 17:22.807
Tomorrow it is.

17:22.848 --> 17:25.518
- Heads up, lads.
- All right?

17:25.601 --> 17:28.604
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She's off.

17:28.688 --> 17:31.023
What a gorgeous flower girl
your eldest made.

17:31.107 --> 17:34.152
- Thanks, Catherine.
- I do envy you.

17:35.528 --> 17:37.613
- Kev, want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

17:37.697 --> 17:39.198
It was lovely to see you all. Ciao.

17:39.282 --> 17:41.284
- Ciao.
- All right, Wen?

17:41.367 --> 17:42.827
All right.

17:44.287 --> 17:45.746
She envies me.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.291
She being sarcastic?

17:48.374 --> 17:50.793
I suppose what she meant was
money can't buy what we have.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.380
Didn't you used to go out with her?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.549
No, love, that was Kevin.

17:56.632 --> 17:58.593
He had this big thing for her.

17:58.676 --> 18:01.679
- And you didn't?
- No.

18:02.847 --> 18:04.599
Not like me and you...
love at first sight.

18:04.682 --> 18:06.684
Oh yeah.

18:06.726 --> 18:10.021
I remember that night. You was
with your mate Audrey at that disco.

18:10.062 --> 18:13.858
Saw this gorgeous little bum
in a pencil skirt.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.402
I thought, "I've got to have that."

18:16.486 --> 18:19.071
But Audrey, she already had a bloke,
so I pulled you.

18:19.155 --> 18:21.324
- Cheeky sod.
- Daddy!

18:21.407 --> 18:23.075
Daddy, come and dance with me.

18:23.159 --> 18:24.786
Come on, Dad!

18:42.053 --> 18:44.764
- I'll just shoot it.
- Piss off, Kevin.

19:09.872 --> 19:11.958
Good morning. I'd like to access

19:12.041 --> 19:13.960
my safe deposit box, please.

19:14.001 --> 19:16.045
Martine Love. L-O-V-E.

19:16.129 --> 19:17.839
Certainly, madam.

19:27.515 --> 19:29.016
Taxi!

19:34.188 --> 19:35.898
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

19:35.982 --> 19:38.860
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

19:40.069 --> 19:41.529
Yeah, right.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.364
Where to, guv?

19:45.783 --> 19:47.827
So what were these
films you were in?

19:47.910 --> 19:50.204
- Forget about it.
- Go on.

19:52.039 --> 19:54.375
Technically, it's what you call...

19:54.417 --> 19:56.127
pornography.

19:56.210 --> 19:58.629
- You're joking.
- No.

19:58.713 --> 20:01.090
So you've been going round town
with a 12-inch mutton dagger

20:01.174 --> 20:02.842
hanging down your pants?

20:02.925 --> 20:04.385
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

20:39.253 --> 20:41.088
Nice.

20:41.172 --> 20:44.717
Fake. Got a posh party
at the weekend.

20:59.732 --> 21:01.734
This is the one.
The lease is available.

21:12.036 --> 21:13.621
Finally.

21:13.704 --> 21:15.665
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.877
Here we go.

21:19.961 --> 21:22.421
So how come you got the inside dope
on this place, Martine?

21:22.505 --> 21:25.007
She knows this bloke...
runs a security company.

21:25.091 --> 21:27.468
Bloke? Is it serious?
Are you getting married?

21:27.552 --> 21:29.345
He is married.
All the better ones are.

21:31.889 --> 21:33.766
Here we go.
Marylebone Road and Baker Street.

21:33.850 --> 21:35.768
On the corner here's the bank,

21:35.852 --> 21:39.188
next door is the Chicken Inn
and at 189... Le Sac.

21:39.272 --> 21:40.815
In the back here
is an underground car park

21:40.857 --> 21:43.192
with direct access
to the shops' basements.

21:43.276 --> 21:46.112
We can pull in here
from Glentworth Street

21:46.195 --> 21:47.780
into the car park
for drop-offs and pick-ups

21:47.780 --> 21:49.532
without being seen
from the street.

21:49.615 --> 21:51.742
We'll dig a tunnel
from the basement of the shop

21:51.826 --> 21:55.413
under the Chicken Inn and pop up
in the safe deposit vault.

21:55.455 --> 21:57.123
I got a question.

21:57.206 --> 21:58.875
What do us lot know
about digging tunnels?

21:58.958 --> 22:02.295
Nothing.
But I know a man who does.

22:02.378 --> 22:04.088
So what do you reckon, Bambas?

22:04.130 --> 22:06.174
What do I reckon?

22:06.257 --> 22:08.134
I reckon I know you guys.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.470
But I don't know her.

22:10.511 --> 22:12.221
Don't worry about Martine,
she's solid.

22:12.305 --> 22:13.765
We go way back.

22:13.848 --> 22:16.392
Terry, you have been
up to some mischief in your time.

22:16.476 --> 22:18.686
But this... this is
serious shit, my friend.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.022
Don't you think it's a little
out of your league?

22:21.105 --> 22:23.149
Maybe it's time we stepped
up to the first division.

22:28.863 --> 22:31.324
There's going to be reinforced
concrete under the vault.

22:31.365 --> 22:33.534
You're going to need
a thermic lance, a jackhammer,

22:33.618 --> 22:36.662
a generator, lights,
ropes, cables, the works.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.207
About 40 feet of digging
before we're under the bank.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.834
Hey, we could hire some micks
from Camden Town to do the digging.

22:41.876 --> 22:43.503
That's brilliant, Dave.
Why don't we just

22:43.586 --> 22:46.047
pay their National Insurance
contributions?

22:46.130 --> 22:48.591
And then you won't have to get dirt
on your Tommy Nutter suit.

22:48.591 --> 22:50.676
This way, Michael.
One more shot. This way.

22:52.011 --> 22:53.513
Thank you, that's great.

22:55.264 --> 22:58.768
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad

22:58.851 --> 23:01.270
to liberate my brothers and sisters

23:01.354 --> 23:04.774
from the enslavement
of the British colonialists.

23:04.857 --> 23:06.692
What about the charges
you are facing?

23:06.734 --> 23:09.237
- How can you leave England?
- They are liars and cowards.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.824
If they had anything against me
but their fear of me,

23:12.907 --> 23:15.118
I'd be tried and jailed.

23:15.201 --> 23:18.246
- See you later, Bambo.
- We're gonna need a front-man on this,

23:18.329 --> 23:21.374
someone who can sign the lease
on the shop and look the business.

23:21.457 --> 23:23.209
I know someone... Guy Singer.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.753
Calls himself "the Major."
It's a load of bollocks,

23:25.795 --> 23:28.089
but he's got this right posh accent

23:28.172 --> 23:30.091
if anyone comes nosing about.

23:33.136 --> 23:35.179
A bit tight under the arms,
don't you think?

23:35.263 --> 23:37.348
Traditional fit, sir.

23:37.432 --> 23:39.183
If one can't raise
one's hands above one's head

23:39.225 --> 23:41.853
it tends to inhibit
any impulsive acts of surrender.

23:46.274 --> 23:48.109
I'll be right back, sir.

23:48.192 --> 23:50.778
What on earth
are you doing here?

23:50.820 --> 23:52.447
Got a bit of business
for you, Guy.

23:52.530 --> 23:53.990
You might be tempted.

24:02.832 --> 24:03.958
Sit down, love.

24:05.209 --> 24:06.586
What do you think you're doing?

24:07.712 --> 24:09.797
Taking the E for a test drive.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.507
Tell your boss he can
have his inventory back

24:11.507 --> 24:13.259
when he settles
Mr. Jessell's debt.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.802
And it'd better be soon

24:14.886 --> 24:16.721
or we'll be back
to tap Terry's kneecaps.

24:20.975 --> 24:22.977
If I was you two,
I'd be looking for another job.

24:30.485 --> 24:32.570
- Lovely. Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:36.365 --> 24:38.326
So, come on then,
what don't I know?

24:38.409 --> 24:40.203
Romantic dinner
on a Monday night?

24:45.374 --> 24:46.834
Look, honey...

24:48.753 --> 24:50.713
I'm gonna be working
some strange hours

24:50.797 --> 24:52.548
over the next week or two.

24:52.590 --> 24:55.218
Don't ask me what I'm doing
because I don't want to lie to you.

24:57.053 --> 24:58.638
What are you doing?

25:01.390 --> 25:03.643
Look, I know I've
caused us a few problems,

25:03.726 --> 25:06.646
but those cars aren't selling.

25:06.729 --> 25:09.107
All I was trying to do
is get out of the game.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.528
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- Will it?

25:13.611 --> 25:15.321
Yeah.

25:15.404 --> 25:17.573
In a better place.

25:17.657 --> 25:20.159
It's for all of us...

25:21.452 --> 25:23.329
for you and the kids.

25:23.412 --> 25:25.873
And how afraid do
I have to be, Terry?

25:32.505 --> 25:35.216
Maybe it'd be a smart thing
if you went and stayed with your aunt...

25:36.759 --> 25:38.678
in case things turn to custard.

25:48.521 --> 25:51.023
So we are settled...
25% to run my girls

25:51.107 --> 25:53.151
till I return from Trinidad.

25:53.192 --> 25:55.153
It's all right,
you don't have to worry.

25:56.529 --> 25:59.782
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

25:59.866 --> 26:02.827
So long as you remember
they are not your own.

26:02.869 --> 26:05.663
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,
I can arrange for a shipment

26:05.746 --> 26:07.206
of some high-grade ganja.

26:07.290 --> 26:10.251
Not interested.
You want my opinion?

26:10.334 --> 26:12.753
I think drugs are responsible
for the moral decay

26:12.837 --> 26:14.589
of this country's young.

26:14.672 --> 26:16.841
No, smut smut and more smut...

26:16.883 --> 26:19.010
that's my special area of interest.

26:19.051 --> 26:20.303
You should think about it.

26:20.386 --> 26:22.013
With these goodies you could make
a lot of dough,

26:22.054 --> 26:23.723
especially with the police
in your pocket.

26:23.806 --> 26:25.641
No, I'm paying enough bung as it is,

26:25.725 --> 26:28.352
but probably not as much
as you're donating

26:28.394 --> 26:30.271
to be permitted
to leave our fair shores.

26:30.354 --> 26:33.024
Not a shilling.
I have something so special,

26:33.107 --> 26:34.650
I don't need to pay anyone.

26:34.734 --> 26:36.569
And what would that be, Michael?

26:36.652 --> 26:39.197
Sorry, Lew.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.449
Well...

26:41.532 --> 26:44.076
whatever it is, you crafty bugger,
I hope you're keeping it safe.

26:44.118 --> 26:46.537
Yes, as safe as it can be in the place
that you recommended.

26:49.624 --> 26:52.627
- You're late.
- Sorry.

26:54.128 --> 26:56.464
This is the Major...
Major Guy Singer,

26:56.547 --> 26:58.049
the final member of our team.

26:58.132 --> 27:00.051
I don't know this man.

27:00.134 --> 27:01.761
- Who are you?
- None of your business.

27:01.803 --> 27:04.472
No secrets around here.
The Major's a con artist.

27:04.555 --> 27:06.641
Usually elderly widows.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.726
There's no need
to bring that up.

27:08.810 --> 27:10.812
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

27:10.895 --> 27:13.648
Handbags and leather accessories
for the discerning lady.

27:13.731 --> 27:15.024
Nice.

27:15.108 --> 27:18.111
I told the district planner's office
about the remodeling.

27:18.152 --> 27:20.279
They gave me the specs
for the sewage, drainage,

27:20.363 --> 27:22.156
gas and power lines.

27:22.198 --> 27:24.242
We'll have to go deep
to miss that lot.

27:25.660 --> 27:28.663
- What's this for?
- That is the thermic lance.

27:28.746 --> 27:30.665
It cuts through
concrete and metal.

27:30.748 --> 27:33.417
We're doing this, eh?

27:33.501 --> 27:35.503
I mean,
we're bloody going for it.

27:35.586 --> 27:37.797
- Let's see what this thing can do.
- Good idea, Kev.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.340
Give us a demonstration, Bambo.

27:39.382 --> 27:41.259
Okay, hold this. Hold it. Here.

27:41.342 --> 27:44.053
Kevin, go stand
over there by the oxygen.

27:44.137 --> 27:46.097
Here we go.

28:01.571 --> 28:04.157
- Turn it off!
- Off off off off!

28:04.240 --> 28:06.993
- Right off!
- Loco!

28:07.076 --> 28:09.120
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

28:09.162 --> 28:11.873
Oh, absolutely.
Professional criminals.

28:11.914 --> 28:14.167
What's the worst-case scenario?

28:14.250 --> 28:16.836
They get caught and go to jail.
No possible connection to us.

28:16.919 --> 28:18.963
What about this model
you're screwing?

28:19.046 --> 28:21.215
What promises have you made
to keep her in line?

28:21.257 --> 28:23.092
None that can't be broken.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.428
Look, she's our only tie
to the bank operation.

28:25.511 --> 28:27.805
If things do go belly-up,
it'll only take one cut

28:27.889 --> 28:29.891
to sever the knot.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.142
What's Gale Benson up to?

28:31.225 --> 28:34.937
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

28:35.021 --> 28:36.314
Could you sign my book please?

28:39.108 --> 28:40.568
Daddy!

28:42.153 --> 28:44.864
I am so glad you decided to come.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.951
This is my father,
Sir Leonard Plugge.

28:48.993 --> 28:50.787
Always happy to meet
Gale's new friends.

28:50.870 --> 28:52.455
Her new name is Hale Kimga.

28:52.497 --> 28:56.793
It's an anagram of the letters
of our names... Hakim and Gale.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.962
- And your name is?
- Hakim.

29:00.004 --> 29:02.173
- Hakim Jamal.
- Right.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.676
Excuse me.

29:10.973 --> 29:12.475
Hello, gorgeous.

29:12.558 --> 29:14.519
So, where's the author?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.771
He's over there
signing his masterpiece.

29:16.854 --> 29:18.856
Why don't you both drop
by the house this weekend

29:18.940 --> 29:20.983
and introduce Mr. Jamal to mother?

29:21.067 --> 29:22.860
Sorry, Daddy, can't do that.

29:22.944 --> 29:25.238
We're popping on down
to the islands for a while.

29:25.321 --> 29:26.948
Let me get you a drink.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.866
Good luck with your book.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.039
So have you read
this book of his?

29:35.123 --> 29:37.333
- You must be joking.
- Right.

29:37.416 --> 29:39.377
You're probably undercover

29:39.460 --> 29:42.922
spying on black power's insidious threat
to the British way of life.

29:43.005 --> 29:44.632
That's very funny.

29:44.715 --> 29:47.176
Tell me, is our little enterprise
still shipshape?

29:47.260 --> 29:49.053
We're currently on schedule, Tim.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.931
We're taking over the shop
on Friday afternoon.

29:52.014 --> 29:55.476
I know if this stuffs up,
I'm in poo-poo land.

29:59.856 --> 30:02.400
We have a blue transit van
just pulled up,

30:02.483 --> 30:04.777
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

30:05.945 --> 30:07.905
And we have one man
entering the shop.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.669
Construction crew for Le Sac.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.412
I've got a question.

31:38.496 --> 31:40.957
What do we do with all the dirt
we're gonna dig out the hole?

31:41.040 --> 31:42.583
It's all been worked out, Dave.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.419
We'll dig another hole in that corner
over there and put it in that.

31:45.461 --> 31:46.921
Over.

31:48.005 --> 31:50.341
If we're to get the job done before
the bank opens on Monday morning,

31:50.383 --> 31:53.594
- we'd better get a wriggle on.
- Want to do the honors, Martine?

31:53.678 --> 31:55.346
This is it. Here we go.

31:58.099 --> 32:00.268
Watch your nails, Martine.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.603
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

32:02.645 --> 32:04.814
Let's get this show on the road.

32:26.085 --> 32:27.545
Some racket there, Alf.

32:27.628 --> 32:29.505
Bloody hell! What's going on?

32:43.978 --> 32:45.646
Kev!

32:48.024 --> 32:49.692
Dave, come on, mate.

32:57.033 --> 32:59.160
Dave, you need a break.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.579
- I'll take over.
- Cheers, Major.

33:04.123 --> 33:05.583
Heads up!

33:12.090 --> 33:14.258
Where's Dave?

33:14.342 --> 33:16.219
No idea.

33:19.972 --> 33:22.892
- Where'd you get to?
- Just checking the door was locked.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.560
Of course it's locked, Dave.

33:24.644 --> 33:27.230
I locked it.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.694
Hang on. What have we got here?

33:36.364 --> 33:37.824
What does this copper want?

33:37.907 --> 33:40.118
Christ, he's not
going in there, is he?

33:42.787 --> 33:45.248
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, get back here.

33:45.331 --> 33:47.959
Stop! Hold it down!
Someone's knocking.

33:48.042 --> 33:50.086
Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop!

33:50.169 --> 33:51.963
- There's somebody...
- Bambas!

33:53.339 --> 33:55.591
Bambas! Hold on.

33:56.676 --> 33:58.678
There's somebody at the door.

34:02.390 --> 34:04.308
- I don't mind going.
- It's my job.

34:13.443 --> 34:15.945
- Coppers.
- It's the Old Bill!

34:25.288 --> 34:27.998
Good evening.
You're working late.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.126
Around the clock, Officer.

34:30.208 --> 34:33.045
Expanding our storage, trying
to complete renovations for the grand...

34:33.087 --> 34:34.547
If you don't mind, sir.

34:37.341 --> 34:38.801
Excuse me!

34:41.344 --> 34:43.222
You using a jackhammer
down there?

34:44.556 --> 34:46.058
Yeah, you had
some complaints, Officer?

34:46.100 --> 34:47.685
Yeah, from some
of your neighbors.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.815
We'll try to keep it down, all right?

34:54.442 --> 34:56.652
Right.

35:00.406 --> 35:02.492
I wonder how they talked
their way out of that one.

35:03.576 --> 35:05.661
Tim, Quinn here.

35:05.745 --> 35:08.122
Yeah, we just had a copper
go into the shop.

35:08.164 --> 35:10.625
We're not sure why.
He's gone now.

35:13.836 --> 35:15.463
All clear.

35:15.546 --> 35:18.424
We need a lookout,
someone on a roof somewhere.

35:18.466 --> 35:20.593
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

35:20.676 --> 35:22.762
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

35:22.804 --> 35:24.180
No, look, we're not
cutting anyone else in.

35:24.180 --> 35:27.183
We won't cut him in on the loot.
Give him the car lot.

35:27.266 --> 35:29.936
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

35:31.479 --> 35:33.481
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.108
Cover that up!

35:41.948 --> 35:43.157
It's not the coppers.

35:49.914 --> 35:53.084
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

35:53.167 --> 35:54.585
- What is it?
- Chicken and chips.

35:56.129 --> 35:57.630
I see.

36:04.387 --> 36:06.764
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

36:08.391 --> 36:09.976
You can't be serious?

36:10.059 --> 36:11.853
I was starving.

36:12.019 --> 36:14.772
Mind the gap.

36:24.991 --> 36:27.285
Radio's in the bag,
binocs as well.

36:27.368 --> 36:29.745
There's a bed-sit
on the top floor of this building

36:29.787 --> 36:32.957
paid for the week.
The ladder will get you to the roof.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.251
You're in from Liverpool
looking for work.

36:35.293 --> 36:36.794
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

36:36.878 --> 36:38.463
Then don't talk to anyone, Eddie.

37:21.547 --> 37:23.508
I'm up on the roof and...

37:23.549 --> 37:26.511
I got a good view
in all directions, over.

37:26.594 --> 37:28.513
Are you in position, Nightjar?

37:28.596 --> 37:30.264
Command HQ, here. Acknowledge.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.809
Yeah, I'm in position.

37:32.892 --> 37:35.645
I can see the front of the bank...
Marylebone Road,

37:35.686 --> 37:38.606
Baker Street.
I can see everything really well.

37:38.689 --> 37:42.110
All clear on
the western front, Guy. Over.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.695
- No names, Eddie.
- Sorry, Dave.

37:46.239 --> 37:48.574
Hey, you delinquents,
what have I told you?

37:48.658 --> 37:50.535
No idle chitchat.

37:50.576 --> 37:52.578
Sorry... over.

37:52.620 --> 37:54.080
Fucking hell.

38:00.128 --> 38:01.879
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

38:01.921 --> 38:03.589
I'll keep an eye
on the shop from here on.

38:03.631 --> 38:05.341
You two go around
to Glentworth Street,

38:05.425 --> 38:07.051
cover the parking garage exit.

38:07.093 --> 38:08.970
Okay.

38:27.572 --> 38:30.950
Nightjar, here. There's some
fella looking through the window.

38:32.618 --> 38:34.537
Oh, hang on.

38:36.289 --> 38:39.083
Wait, hang on, he's going.
He's going.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.002
Yeah, he's gone. Over.

38:43.379 --> 38:45.423
Roger, Nightjar. Over and out.

38:47.008 --> 38:49.302
I'm gonna go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

38:49.385 --> 38:50.928
Do you want anything?

38:51.012 --> 38:53.639
Ooh, packet of Seniors.

38:53.681 --> 38:55.433
There you go, sir.

38:56.726 --> 38:58.853
Two packets of Rothmans,
two Senior Service

38:58.936 --> 39:01.147
- and eight bags of crisps.
- Okay.

39:01.230 --> 39:04.567
Hello, gorgeous.
We still on track?

39:04.650 --> 39:07.278
We had a scare last night.
The cops came around.

39:07.361 --> 39:09.572
Can't you pull rank and make sure
it doesn't happen again?

39:09.572 --> 39:13.034
No. We can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

39:13.075 --> 39:15.578
- Wish I was.
- What about your friend, Terry?

39:15.661 --> 39:18.164
Where's he planning
to carve up the proceeds?

39:20.333 --> 39:21.584
Shit.

39:24.378 --> 39:27.090
- Pint here, chief.
- What's wrong?

39:27.173 --> 39:29.842
I had to take a break.

39:29.884 --> 39:32.095
Who's that you was talking to?

39:32.178 --> 39:34.680
I wasn't.
He was trying to chat me up.

39:35.932 --> 39:37.517
It does happen you know.

39:38.851 --> 39:40.812
- Right.
- There you are, love.

39:40.895 --> 39:42.730
- Cheers. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

39:42.772 --> 39:45.525
Anyway, what you doing here?
You following me?

39:47.443 --> 39:49.237
No.

39:49.278 --> 39:50.738
Just wanted a pint.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.366
Then enjoy it.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.397
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

40:24.480 --> 40:27.233
You're rather impressed
with our friend Hakim, aren't you?

40:27.316 --> 40:29.277
I know. Rule number one...

40:29.360 --> 40:31.529
don't get emotionally involved.

40:31.612 --> 40:33.197
Doesn't mean
I can't enjoy my work.

40:34.323 --> 40:36.033
You certainly do.

40:37.410 --> 40:40.580
What's your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

40:40.663 --> 40:42.582
We are not amused.

40:42.665 --> 40:44.834
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

40:44.917 --> 40:46.627
- he'd have a heart attack.
- Yeah.

40:47.712 --> 40:51.340
Here you are.
Credit cards and cash.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.093
If he does have copies of the photos
and negatives there, they'll be hidden.

40:54.135 --> 40:57.472
Find them, destroy them
and then get out.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.349
Michael X thinks he's safe
tucked away in Trinidad.

41:00.433 --> 41:03.436
That'll all change
if we're successful here.

41:03.519 --> 41:05.730
Just remember, Gale,
he's a nasty piece of work.

41:05.813 --> 41:07.857
He's a crazy, dope-smoking,

41:07.899 --> 41:10.985
lunatic, pimp extortionist
is what he is.

41:13.196 --> 41:16.073
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

41:16.115 --> 41:18.534
Yeah, everything's
all right, mate.

41:19.744 --> 41:22.079
Listen, what if I want
to go for a pee up here?

41:22.163 --> 41:24.207
I don't know,
use your imagination.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.752
Stay off the radio unless
you see any Old Bill, all right?

41:29.712 --> 41:31.672
Yeah, all right. If I see the Old Bill,
I'll let you know.

41:31.714 --> 41:34.092
I'll speak to you in a bit.

41:34.175 --> 41:35.927
Over.

41:42.225 --> 41:44.102
Hey, Bambas!

41:44.185 --> 41:46.145
What's all this brickwork?

41:46.229 --> 41:48.439
I don't know,
it wasn't on the plans.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.904
- Terry!
- Fucking hell!

41:54.987 --> 41:57.198
Terry! Bambas!

41:57.281 --> 41:58.866
Terry, talk to me!

42:01.160 --> 42:03.162
Tell!

42:03.246 --> 42:04.914
Fuck.

42:04.997 --> 42:06.999
Terry! Talk to me!

42:10.837 --> 42:12.547
- You all right?
- I think so, yeah.

42:13.756 --> 42:15.550
What happened?

42:15.633 --> 42:17.885
The floor just caved in.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.762
Bloody hell, Terry,
don't do that to me.

42:19.846 --> 42:21.639
I thought you was a goner.

42:21.681 --> 42:23.391
Give us a light, Dave.

42:25.476 --> 42:26.978
What's down there?

42:28.813 --> 42:30.314
It's a pile of skeletons.

42:30.356 --> 42:33.151
You're joking.
Let's hope they're not the last gang

42:33.192 --> 42:34.777
who tried to take this bank.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.578
Latin, roughly translated...

42:43.661 --> 42:45.538
"Lamb of God,
forgive us our sins."

42:45.580 --> 42:47.373
How do you know Latin?

42:47.415 --> 42:48.916
Catholic school.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.335
The Bleeding Heart Sisters
of Eternal Misery.

42:51.419 --> 42:53.379
Interesting date, 1665.

42:53.421 --> 42:55.214
You know what year
that was, don't you?

42:55.256 --> 42:57.467
The last time
West Ham won the Cup.

42:57.550 --> 42:59.719
It was the Great Plague
of London.

42:59.761 --> 43:02.305
This must be a burial chamber,

43:02.388 --> 43:04.056
the crypt where
they dumped the bodies.

43:04.098 --> 43:06.392
What, all these poor bastards
had the plague?

43:06.434 --> 43:08.060
It could be infectious.

43:08.144 --> 43:09.729
I don't think so, Dave.

43:09.812 --> 43:12.148
This crypt goes
all the way under the bank.

43:12.231 --> 43:15.109
- It could put us in the vault quicker.
- Well, how are we gonna do that?

43:34.128 --> 43:35.546
Concrete.

43:35.630 --> 43:37.256
Floor of the vault.

43:38.674 --> 43:40.843
- Time to get paid for all our work.
- Right.

43:40.927 --> 43:43.930
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

43:45.014 --> 43:46.724
I'll be happy if
we don't hit the sewage.

44:36.065 --> 44:38.943
When are you guys gonna hit the vault?
I'm freezing my tits off up here.

44:38.943 --> 44:40.570
Over.

44:40.653 --> 44:42.530
In the army, soldiers would
pull on their puds

44:42.572 --> 44:44.907
to keep their blood flowing.
Over.

44:44.949 --> 44:47.869
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

44:48.953 --> 44:51.873
- Over.
- Yes. We welcome new members.

44:51.956 --> 44:54.542
Roger. Over and out.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.794
Emergency operator,
which service do you require?

44:56.878 --> 44:58.379
The police, please.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.339
Putting you through.

45:00.423 --> 45:02.258
- Police here, can I help you?
- Yes.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.801
I'm a ham radio operator

45:03.885 --> 45:06.220
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

45:20.568 --> 45:23.529
We're in. Dave, get the ladder.

45:59.774 --> 46:02.693
We'll make the move
into the vault after we take a break.

46:02.735 --> 46:04.862
Need to let the fumes clear out.

46:04.946 --> 46:06.989
You're having a laugh, isn't you?
Let's go in now.

46:07.073 --> 46:09.367
Dave, nothing's going nowhere.

46:09.450 --> 46:11.911
You can hardly breathe in there.

46:11.953 --> 46:14.288
Nightjar, are you there? Over.

46:14.372 --> 46:16.374
Nightjar here. Over.

46:16.457 --> 46:17.959
We're in. Over.

46:19.168 --> 46:22.046
- What, in the actual vault?
- Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

46:22.088 --> 46:24.632
Great. Great.
That's great news. Over.

46:26.092 --> 46:28.136
We're taking a break.
We're knackered.

46:28.219 --> 46:30.388
We need to get some sleep,
get a bit of shuteye

46:30.430 --> 46:32.223
while the fumes clear out. Over.

46:32.265 --> 46:33.391
Oh, lucky you.

46:33.474 --> 46:36.769
My eyes are like
organ stops. Over.

46:36.811 --> 46:39.480
We can smell the money though.
Over.

46:39.564 --> 46:42.442
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

46:42.483 --> 46:45.069
I want a warm bath
and a cup of tea. Over.

46:46.112 --> 46:48.698
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just you hold tight.

46:48.781 --> 46:52.452
Oh, lucky you.
My eyes are like organ stops. Over.

46:52.535 --> 46:54.579
We can smell the money though.

46:54.662 --> 46:56.914
I rang four other
police stations before you,

46:56.998 --> 46:58.541
but nobody took me seriously.

46:58.624 --> 47:00.793
Said it was probably a hoax.

47:00.835 --> 47:02.754
How strong was the signal,
Mr. Addey?

47:02.837 --> 47:05.173
I'd say they were
within a 10-mile radius.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.091
There must be
a ton of banks in that area.

47:08.384 --> 47:10.344
And when was the last time
you picked them up?

47:10.386 --> 47:12.972
They've been quiet
for about an hour.

47:13.055 --> 47:15.516
What about releasing
the tapes to the radio and TV?

47:15.558 --> 47:17.185
Maybe somebody can
recognize the voices.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.728
No no.

47:18.811 --> 47:20.855
They hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

47:20.938 --> 47:22.482
No, we should keep listening.

47:22.565 --> 47:24.859
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.

47:24.901 --> 47:27.445
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I'm going back to the station.

47:27.487 --> 47:29.489
You call me if you hear anything.

48:31.551 --> 48:33.094
Hey.

48:36.013 --> 48:37.974
You scared the piss out of me.

48:41.436 --> 48:43.896
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

48:46.899 --> 48:49.152
Yeah, a bit jangly myself.

48:49.235 --> 48:51.070
I just had to come and have a look.

48:52.155 --> 48:53.614
Our future's in those boxes.

48:57.201 --> 48:59.787
So what you gonna
do with your share?

49:01.122 --> 49:02.582
Vanish.

49:02.665 --> 49:04.167
Martine Love will cease to exist.

49:08.463 --> 49:10.715
Why, you think if you vanish
you'll become someone else?

49:11.799 --> 49:13.885
At least no one
will know who I was.

49:15.219 --> 49:16.554
Why'd you pick Kev and me?

49:16.637 --> 49:19.432
You could've
found better thieves.

49:20.892 --> 49:22.351
Old times' sake.

49:25.605 --> 49:28.983
Most of your old times
were spent with Kevin, not me.

49:29.066 --> 49:31.819
And Kevin has it in his mind
we had this passionate affair.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.448
The truth is, it came down
to four Chinese meals

49:35.531 --> 49:37.033
and a roll in the hay.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.912
And that was a long time ago.

50:24.330 --> 50:26.624
All right.
Let's make some money.

50:44.684 --> 50:46.269
Pull it out. Pull it out.

50:46.352 --> 50:47.812
Look at this!

50:49.689 --> 50:51.441
Look at all this cash.

50:51.524 --> 50:53.860
- Wads of it.
- Fantastic.

50:53.943 --> 50:56.154
Guys, gold bars.

50:56.237 --> 50:58.489
Diamonds. Diamonds!

51:07.039 --> 51:09.208
Guys, what's going on?

51:10.918 --> 51:13.546
How'd your wife fancy a tiara?

51:13.588 --> 51:15.131
Too bloody right.

51:17.592 --> 51:20.178
- Get the cash. The cash!
- Look at the quality.

51:20.261 --> 51:23.097
- Emeralds.
- This is better than winning the pools.

51:36.652 --> 51:38.780
Dave, give us
a hand with this one.

51:40.782 --> 51:42.325
What's so special
about this box?

51:42.408 --> 51:43.951
It's my lucky number.

51:50.792 --> 51:53.044
All yours, me lovely.

51:53.127 --> 51:54.879
- Here you are.
- Cheers.

52:17.693 --> 52:20.613
Holy shit. You know who that is.

52:20.696 --> 52:22.323
That's Princess Margaret.

52:22.365 --> 52:24.909
Terry, anything
for the widows and orphans fund?

52:26.661 --> 52:28.204
Will that do?

52:28.287 --> 52:30.581
God bless you, guv'ner,
very generous.

52:30.665 --> 52:32.458
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

52:32.542 --> 52:34.544
You don't know what you're
throwing and what you're keeping.

52:34.544 --> 52:36.087
Yeah, well, we know
what money looks like

52:36.129 --> 52:37.880
and we're not throwing
that away, are we?

52:46.889 --> 52:48.474
How long does it take
to rob a bank?

52:51.477 --> 52:54.147
We've just about
cleaned this joint out, eh?

52:54.230 --> 52:55.940
More cash.

52:56.023 --> 52:57.775
Look at this.

53:13.875 --> 53:16.294
- No, nothing.
- No, still nothing.

53:17.378 --> 53:19.505
Sarge, what we need is something
that will motivate the robbers

53:19.547 --> 53:22.008
to go on air,
give away their location.

53:22.091 --> 53:25.511
Right. Bait to lure the fish.

53:29.015 --> 53:30.433
No, they're not there.

53:30.475 --> 53:32.643
- Not transmitting.
- They're not there, sir.

53:32.727 --> 53:34.854
Move to the next bank,
Sierra Lima Two.

53:42.987 --> 53:44.322
No.

53:44.363 --> 53:46.949
We're still getting nothing, Sarge.

53:47.033 --> 53:50.536
Okay, Sierra Lima Two,
move to the next location.

53:53.247 --> 53:56.084
My God, the stuff
that some people collect.

53:57.502 --> 53:59.879
- What you got there, Terry?
- '47.

53:59.962 --> 54:02.215
- '47?
- Sounds like a good year to me.

54:02.298 --> 54:04.634
- Three cheers.
- Hurray!

54:05.718 --> 54:08.638
Pass 'em around.
Come on, Terry, give us some!

54:20.775 --> 54:22.068
Dave!

54:24.695 --> 54:26.364
Here, Major! Get it down ya!

54:26.447 --> 54:28.116
Fellas, they're onto you.

54:28.199 --> 54:30.284
- Listen, they're onto you.
- Fuck.

54:30.368 --> 54:32.370
Coppers right on your doorstep.

54:38.334 --> 54:39.961
Speak to me, Nightjar.

54:40.044 --> 54:41.671
Coppers right on your doorstep!

54:41.754 --> 54:43.756
Listen, hang on. Hang on.
They're not going in

54:43.840 --> 54:46.175
but they're not going away.
Wait, wait.

54:46.259 --> 54:47.885
Sarge, we just heard.

54:47.927 --> 54:51.180
The thieves' lookout says there are
police outside the bank right now.

54:51.264 --> 54:53.433
- Which bank?
- I haven't got a clue.

54:53.516 --> 54:56.060
We've got patrols outside
half the banks in the West End.

54:56.102 --> 54:58.729
Keep listening. We need to pinpoint
exactly where they are.

55:00.106 --> 55:02.775
Wait, hang on.

55:05.820 --> 55:08.906
Guys, you got a car
just pulled up, some bloke.

55:11.033 --> 55:12.827
He's going up
to the front door with the cops.

55:16.873 --> 55:18.750
Guys, he's unlocking
the front door.

55:20.042 --> 55:23.504
They're going in. Shit. Over.

55:23.546 --> 55:26.299
- Oh no.
- Shit.

55:28.593 --> 55:30.303
- Where's the vault?
- Downstairs.

55:36.225 --> 55:37.435
Follow me.

55:59.082 --> 56:00.374
Looks fine.

56:04.337 --> 56:06.547
- I want to look inside.
- It's on a time lock.

56:06.589 --> 56:08.591
It can't be opened
until tomorrow morning.

56:08.674 --> 56:10.176
Mm-hmm.

56:11.636 --> 56:13.805
Well, it isn't my bank being robbed.

56:23.106 --> 56:24.565
Thank you.

56:26.317 --> 56:28.277
Fellas, I think they're going away.

56:36.327 --> 56:37.912
They're gone.

56:46.129 --> 56:47.839
We should get out of here.

56:47.922 --> 56:49.465
- They could be coming back.
- Yeah, all right.

56:49.465 --> 56:52.385
- We need to let Eddie know.
- Nightjar.

56:55.138 --> 56:57.390
Nightjar!

56:57.473 --> 57:00.268
No! Fuck.

57:01.310 --> 57:04.021
Shit. Fuck.

57:04.105 --> 57:05.648
Shit. Oh, shit.

57:05.731 --> 57:07.775
Are you there, Nightjar?

57:10.027 --> 57:13.030
The ambulance reports it's outside
the Lloyds Bank on Baker Street.

57:13.114 --> 57:15.324
Nightjar, can you hear me?

57:16.451 --> 57:18.369
Have you gone asleep, Nightjar?

57:29.380 --> 57:31.174
Nightjar, are you there?

57:31.215 --> 57:33.718
Look, if he's not picking up,
something's wrong.

57:33.760 --> 57:37.013
You're right. Let's grab all the cash
and jewels and get the fuck out of here.

57:37.096 --> 57:39.599
What about our gear? We can't leave
anything that might incriminate us.

57:39.599 --> 57:41.934
- We'll come back for it if we can.
- What about all the other boxes?

57:41.976 --> 57:44.896
Doesn't matter, Dave.
Put everything in a bag and let's go.

57:44.979 --> 57:46.606
He's right, let's move. Come on!

57:49.400 --> 57:51.736
- No.
- There's nothing there, Sarge.

57:51.778 --> 57:53.237
You sure?

57:53.321 --> 57:55.656
There's no mention
of the ambulance.

57:55.740 --> 57:57.283
Nothing, move on,
Sierra Lima Two.

58:11.506 --> 58:13.341
- That's them.
- Finally.

58:13.424 --> 58:14.967
Come on, let's go.

58:16.344 --> 58:18.513
The van is leaving.
We will follow them. Over.

58:18.596 --> 58:20.431
Stop them as soon as possible.

58:32.360 --> 58:33.820
Open the door!

58:33.903 --> 58:35.780
What have I done, guv'ner?

58:35.822 --> 58:38.157
Open the back door. Come on.

58:38.241 --> 58:40.660
Some fella paid me 50 quid
to pick up his van

58:40.743 --> 58:42.203
and drop it at Heathrow Airport.

58:44.455 --> 58:46.374
Jesus Christ.

58:48.543 --> 58:50.253
- Where's the van?
- Change of plan.

58:50.336 --> 58:52.255
Precautionary measure.

58:52.338 --> 58:54.173
I've organized
alternative transport.

58:54.215 --> 58:57.176
- Why?
- None of us have met your boyfriend,

58:57.260 --> 58:59.470
the alarm bloke
who clued you up about the job.

58:59.554 --> 59:00.888
Could have set us up.

59:06.727 --> 59:08.813
We bloody well pulled it off!

59:08.896 --> 59:10.773
Done with military
precision, hey, Major?

59:10.857 --> 59:13.693
Now, that I'm physically secure,
I think I'll promote myself to Colonel.

59:15.069 --> 59:17.071
Hey, do you know
what I'm gonna do?

59:17.113 --> 59:19.657
Buy me mum a new house,
something with a garden.

59:19.740 --> 59:21.868
I thought you'd be
off to Copenhagen, Dave.

59:21.951 --> 59:24.412
- Why would I go to Copenhagen?
- Have your cock shortened.

59:25.913 --> 59:28.207
Yeah, well, maybe
what they chop off of mine,

59:28.249 --> 59:30.960
they can add
onto your little pinkie.

59:57.445 --> 59:59.280
How'd you find this place, Terry?

01:00:00.323 --> 01:00:02.700
Bloke I know used to run
a chop shop here.

01:00:02.784 --> 01:00:04.285
He's in the nick now.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:07.580
How could you lose control
of the operation?

01:00:07.663 --> 01:00:09.665
I thought you were
on top of this thing.

01:00:09.749 --> 01:00:11.959
Sir, it worked. They did the job.
They robbed the vault.

01:00:12.001 --> 01:00:15.379
And we have no idea
where the fuck they are.

01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:18.091
Do you know,
an ugly thought has just occurred.

01:00:18.174 --> 01:00:20.635
Lots of money in that vault...
jewelry, bonds.

01:00:20.676 --> 01:00:23.304
You and your sweetie haven't cooked up
something between you, I hope.

01:00:23.346 --> 01:00:25.848
- You think I'd betray you?
- There are precedents.

01:00:25.932 --> 01:00:28.476
Two of our former colleagues
now live in bloody Moscow.

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.478
Let's hope they don't
have another bidder.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.522
She won't cross us.
She knows what we're capable of.

01:00:32.522 --> 01:00:35.233
How does she even know
who the hell we are?

01:00:35.316 --> 01:00:38.319
I'm sure she'll contact me
when she comes to her senses.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:40.488
Going anywhere else
would be a death sentence.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.658
You'd better hope
she does, Everett...

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.701
or it may be yours.

01:00:57.004 --> 01:00:58.923
Here you go, Bambas.
That's your lot.

01:01:01.384 --> 01:01:05.012
"Never washed after
our magic moment. Snooky."

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:14.689
Hey, Dave. Look at this.

01:01:15.898 --> 01:01:19.110
I've seen this bloke on the TV.

01:01:19.193 --> 01:01:20.695
The old perv!

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:24.073
I've seen this face before.
He's an MP.

01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:26.284
Lord what's his name? You know.

01:01:26.367 --> 01:01:28.327
Always wears
those poncey bowties.

01:01:28.411 --> 01:01:30.747
Not in that picture he's not.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.623
Maybe this is one
of your old movies, Dave.

01:01:32.707 --> 01:01:34.208
Piss off, Kev.

01:01:34.292 --> 01:01:35.710
Timely suggestion.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.087
I believe I'll take my share

01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:40.339
and be on my way

01:01:40.423 --> 01:01:43.342
before the bank opens in the morning
and the shit hits the proverbial fan.

01:01:43.384 --> 01:01:45.344
I'm with you, Guy.

01:01:45.428 --> 01:01:47.388
I don't have to remind you,
keep a low profile.

01:01:47.472 --> 01:01:48.931
No buying Aston Martins, Bambas.

01:01:48.973 --> 01:01:52.101
The only thing I'm buying
is a one-way ticket back to Cyprus.

01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:53.853
I'm never coming back.

01:01:53.936 --> 01:01:56.105
We should have a reunion
in 20 years.

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.982
The Savoy Grill.

01:01:58.024 --> 01:02:00.067
Yeah, right. Maybe for you, Guy.

01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:01.903
They still wouldn't
let us lot in.

01:02:04.113 --> 01:02:05.907
- Bambo.
- Goodbye, my friend.

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:07.617
Take care of yourself, mate.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.160
And Major.

01:02:13.915 --> 01:02:16.292
Be lucky.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:18.086
Bambas...

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:19.754
goodbye, old chap.

01:02:26.219 --> 01:02:28.513
Okay, what's going on?
You two have been staring daggers

01:02:28.554 --> 01:02:30.723
at each other since you left the bank.

01:02:30.807 --> 01:02:32.433
What is it, lovers' tiff?

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.984
I think Martine's
got something to tell us.

01:02:47.073 --> 01:02:50.201
Hang about,
that's Princess Margaret.

01:02:50.284 --> 01:02:52.078
Fuck me.

01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:56.165
Where'd these come from?

01:02:56.249 --> 01:02:59.585
You knew the exact box
this stuff was in, Martine.

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:02.922
You better come clean
and tell us what this is really about.

01:03:05.633 --> 01:03:07.635
About a month ago,
I got busted at Heathrow

01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:09.929
on a drug charge.

01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:12.849
This guy I know said he'd
fix it to keep me out of jail

01:03:12.932 --> 01:03:15.351
if I do him a favor.

01:03:15.435 --> 01:03:16.894
He knew I knew some villains.

01:03:16.978 --> 01:03:18.688
He wanted to set up
a robbery to get these.

01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:21.607
Fucking hell.

01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:24.569
That would be the bloke you met
in the Player's Club?

01:03:24.652 --> 01:03:27.113
Same guy you said was trying
to pick you up in the club, right?

01:03:27.196 --> 01:03:29.323
- Yeah.
- So who is he?

01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:31.617
He's a guy I met
at the Sombrero Club.

01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:33.828
He works for some
shady outfit in Whitehall.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:36.122
Hold on, hold on.
What, you mean MI fucking 5?

01:03:36.164 --> 01:03:37.665
Or 6?

01:03:37.707 --> 01:03:40.168
We could get
seriously nicked here, Martine.

01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:43.713
No, we couldn't. All Tim wants
is the contents of box 118.

01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:46.883
The deal with him
is we get to keep everything else.

01:03:48.217 --> 01:03:49.802
And you believed that?

01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:52.180
You put your trust in some prick
we've never even met?

01:03:52.221 --> 01:03:53.890
You lied to us, Martine.

01:03:53.973 --> 01:03:55.641
We were sitting ducks
right from the start.

01:03:55.683 --> 01:03:56.934
Thank you very much.

01:03:57.018 --> 01:03:59.896
You think it's a coincidence
that you get busted for drugs

01:03:59.979 --> 01:04:02.398
and your Tim just happens
to have a plan to rob a bank?

01:04:02.482 --> 01:04:04.150
This can work out.

01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:06.277
We give them the photos
and everything else in that box

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.321
and we get to keep the rest
and we're free and clear.

01:04:08.362 --> 01:04:10.198
These people aren't
regular cozzers, Martine.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:12.658
They're above that.
They do things coppers can't.

01:04:12.742 --> 01:04:16.162
If they think we've seen these photos,
we're as expendable as dogshit.

01:04:17.246 --> 01:04:19.791
Do you know what?
I've seen those shots.

01:04:19.874 --> 01:04:21.542
And I know we're either dogshit

01:04:21.584 --> 01:04:23.711
or about to be dogshit.
I'm out of here.

01:04:24.754 --> 01:04:26.506
I'm not waiting for a load
of spooks and coppers

01:04:26.547 --> 01:04:29.425
to come cracking my head.
I'm splitting like Guy and Bambas.

01:04:29.509 --> 01:04:31.969
- Be better if we stuck together, Dave.
- Why, Tell?

01:04:32.053 --> 01:04:34.972
'Cause we've been so truthful
with each other so far? Eh?

01:04:35.056 --> 01:04:37.850
- Hey, come on.
- No, I'm going home, Kev,

01:04:37.934 --> 01:04:40.895
to see me mum.
And then I'm going far away,

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:43.272
as far as I can get away from here.

01:04:47.652 --> 01:04:49.237
We'd better get out of here too

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.114
in case Guy or Bambas
get picked up.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:53.241
Better take the lot of this.

01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:56.828
There might be someone else in this
shit to cause us some more grief.

01:05:00.832 --> 01:05:02.792
One of those, mate.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:05.002
Here you go, guv'ner.

01:05:05.086 --> 01:05:06.671
- Keep the change.
- Cor, thanks.

01:05:14.679 --> 01:05:16.889
They overheard our radio chat.

01:05:16.973 --> 01:05:18.391
Fucking hell.

01:05:21.769 --> 01:05:23.688
"Police last night
were trying to home in

01:05:23.729 --> 01:05:26.691
on a £300,000 bank raid."
They still don't know what bank it was.

01:05:26.774 --> 01:05:28.151
300 grand?

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:30.820
It was a bit more than that.
More like three million.

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:06.773
- Hello?
- Martine Love.

01:06:06.856 --> 01:06:08.733
Thank God.
Put her through, then run a trace.

01:06:10.193 --> 01:06:12.320
- It's me.
- What happened?

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.946
- Where the hell are you?
- London.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:16.699
- I know, of course. I mean where?
- I know what you mean.

01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:18.576
- Martine, we have to meet.
- I agree.

01:06:18.618 --> 01:06:22.038
Why don't you come over to my place?
I'll make you a cocktail.

01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:24.624
We'll have a roll in the hay
for old times' sake.

01:06:24.707 --> 01:06:27.710
Oh, right. You've already
been there, haven't you?

01:06:27.794 --> 01:06:30.421
Probably have your men
keeping lookout for me now.

01:06:30.463 --> 01:06:32.965
You're not in a position
to play games, Martine.

01:06:33.007 --> 01:06:35.510
No threats, please, Tim.

01:06:35.593 --> 01:06:38.012
Why didn't you tell me what it was
I was set up to get for you?

01:06:38.054 --> 01:06:39.764
For your own good.

01:06:39.806 --> 01:06:41.474
I care about your safety, Martine.

01:06:41.557 --> 01:06:43.101
Right.

01:06:44.852 --> 01:06:47.647
I suppose I give you what you want,
we go our separate ways.

01:06:47.688 --> 01:06:49.732
- Well, that's what I promised.
- Okay.

01:06:49.816 --> 01:06:53.111
Today, Tottenham Court Road tube,
northern line, northbound platform.

01:06:53.152 --> 01:06:54.654
10:30 sharp.

01:06:54.695 --> 01:06:56.989
Tottenham Court Road, 10:30.

01:06:57.031 --> 01:06:58.616
Good.

01:06:58.658 --> 01:07:01.285
"London vaults checked
after radio ham

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:03.287
tunes in to a crime."

01:07:03.329 --> 01:07:05.915
Christ! What a fiasco!

01:07:05.998 --> 01:07:08.626
And now the particular bank
has been identified,

01:07:08.709 --> 01:07:10.211
the story will be
all over the news.

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:12.046
We've heard it already is.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.217
If we don't get
onto the case quickly,

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.885
the police will have
nabbed these robbers

01:07:17.969 --> 01:07:20.471
and God knows what
will happen to our photographs.

01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:22.432
Phillip, get over to the bank.

01:07:22.515 --> 01:07:24.517
Take control of the situation.

01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:27.520
Gentlemen.

01:07:27.562 --> 01:07:30.481
I've just had a conversation
with one Martine Love.

01:07:30.565 --> 01:07:32.984
- Where is she?
- Call was traced to a public phone box

01:07:33.067 --> 01:07:36.154
in Earls Court. The good news is,
she's arranged to meet.

01:07:36.237 --> 01:07:37.822
That is good news.

01:07:37.905 --> 01:07:39.574
I'll be better off going alone.

01:07:39.657 --> 01:07:41.200
Yeah.

01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:43.828
- Tim's agreed to meet.
- It's all over the news.

01:07:44.954 --> 01:07:47.290
They found the location
of the bank.

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:48.875
So what?

01:07:51.127 --> 01:07:53.129
Stand back. Please stand back.

01:07:54.422 --> 01:07:55.965
Keep the change.

01:07:57.967 --> 01:08:00.094
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't go in.
There's been a robbery.

01:08:00.094 --> 01:08:02.388
We know there's been a robbery.
That's why we're all here.

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:18.446
Everybody that works here...
that means everybody...

01:08:18.488 --> 01:08:19.988
speak to them.

01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:22.283
Gerald!

01:08:22.325 --> 01:08:24.285
You work in robbery now, then?

01:08:24.327 --> 01:08:25.870
You're a long way
off your patch.

01:08:25.953 --> 01:08:28.163
Regional Crime Squad now.

01:08:28.247 --> 01:08:30.416
Just dropped by to see
what all the fuss is about.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.960
Pretty cheeky, that radio bit.

01:08:33.044 --> 01:08:35.671
These walkie-talkie robbers certainly
caught your lot on the hop.

01:08:35.755 --> 01:08:37.673
Makes us all look stupid.

01:08:37.715 --> 01:08:40.885
Yeah, well, you're pretty chummy
with all the villains around town.

01:08:40.968 --> 01:08:43.554
You got any idea
who could've done this?

01:08:43.638 --> 01:08:45.807
None of my informants.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.102
We have been waiting here
quite some time

01:08:49.185 --> 01:08:51.270
and so far you people
have told us absolutely nothing.

01:08:51.312 --> 01:08:54.816
If you would like to give us an itemized
list of the contents of your boxes,

01:08:54.857 --> 01:08:56.526
we may be able to ascertain
what's missing.

01:08:56.526 --> 01:08:59.529
Are you mad? The whole point
of having a safe deposit box

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:02.115
is so that people like you
don't know what's in it.

01:09:04.117 --> 01:09:07.161
- I want to speak to a Roy Given.
- Yeah, that's me.

01:09:07.245 --> 01:09:10.206
This robbery's now a matter of
national security. I want everybody out.

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:12.250
This is a police investigation.

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.461
Not anymore.
Call your superiors.

01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:19.756
Who the bloody hell
does he think is?

01:09:19.841 --> 01:09:22.218
Spooks. 5 or 6,

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.054
I can never tell the difference.
They all go to the same tailor

01:09:25.138 --> 01:09:27.432
and they all went
to the same bloody school.

01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:29.809
Let's get some copies
of the walkie-talkie tapes

01:09:29.892 --> 01:09:32.228
out to the news boys.

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.397
Maybe the public
can help identify the villains.

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:37.942
So tell me...

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:39.527
which of the boxes
were ransacked?

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.654
The lot: 100s through the 400s.

01:09:45.742 --> 01:09:48.411
Well, we're in the crapper, Gerry.
Both of us.

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:50.912
Both? Why is it my problem?

01:09:50.955 --> 01:09:52.957
Accounts have to be balanced,
records kept.

01:09:52.999 --> 01:09:55.710
And I wouldn't likely keep the books
around here, now would I?

01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:58.588
Spell it out, Lew.
Be more specific.

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.467
I have a ledger...

01:10:02.508 --> 01:10:04.802
a record of every payment
I've ever made

01:10:04.886 --> 01:10:06.429
to you and your colleagues.

01:10:06.512 --> 01:10:09.307
It was in my safety deposit box.

01:10:09.348 --> 01:10:12.435
And I think we can safely assume it's
now in the possession of the robbers.

01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:14.353
Jesus wept.

01:10:14.437 --> 01:10:16.397
And I think you'll agree,
we have to find those villains

01:10:16.439 --> 01:10:17.857
before your honest
colleagues do.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.317
For fuck's sake.

01:10:28.076 --> 01:10:30.536
- Who is this?
- Lew Vogel.

01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:32.705
Hold on. Get up.

01:10:32.789 --> 01:10:34.332
Go on. Wake up.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.712
What you want, Lew?

01:10:39.796 --> 01:10:43.633
I'm afraid I've got some potentially
bad news for you, Michael.

01:10:43.716 --> 01:10:47.011
Your safety deposit box
at the Baker Street bank...

01:10:47.053 --> 01:10:49.305
- what's its number?
- Why do you ask?

01:10:49.388 --> 01:10:52.517
Well, over the weekend some thieves
broke into the bank vault and robbed it.

01:10:52.558 --> 01:10:55.770
So if your box is
in the 100 to 400 numbers,

01:10:55.853 --> 01:10:58.731
I'm afraid all your stuff will be gone.
Mine too, unhappily.

01:10:58.815 --> 01:11:00.608
What? How can this
happen in London?

01:11:00.691 --> 01:11:02.360
Well, I promise you,
it has happened.

01:11:02.401 --> 01:11:05.738
And I promise you, these thieves
will be found and dealt with.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.324
You can rely on it.
I'll keep you informed.

01:11:08.408 --> 01:11:09.951
Thank you.

01:11:51.159 --> 01:11:53.244
Mind the gap, please.

01:12:16.476 --> 01:12:17.977
Anyone touches me, follows me,

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.396
Martine takes your snaps
right to Fleet Street, understood?

01:12:27.904 --> 01:12:30.114
You want box 118, Tim.

01:12:30.198 --> 01:12:32.909
You have no idea the danger you
and your chums are in, do you?

01:12:32.992 --> 01:12:34.827
Is that right?
And why would that be?

01:12:34.911 --> 01:12:37.080
You've opened Pandora's Box,
you dumb prick.

01:12:37.163 --> 01:12:39.582
- That's why.
- I know what's at stake.

01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:41.709
And I know how
expendable we are.

01:12:41.793 --> 01:12:43.503
- So I'm changing the deal.
- Is that right?

01:12:43.544 --> 01:12:46.881
Yeah.
You get all your nasty pictures,

01:12:46.923 --> 01:12:48.591
but here's the twist:

01:12:48.674 --> 01:12:50.927
We get indemnity...
fresh passports,

01:12:50.968 --> 01:12:53.429
safe passage out of the country
for the whole team,

01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:55.765
and an official signed
document guaranteeing

01:12:55.807 --> 01:12:57.809
we won't be prosecuted
and we won't be pursued.

01:12:57.892 --> 01:13:01.270
- You can't be serious.
- You can bet your bollocks I'm serious.

01:13:01.354 --> 01:13:03.523
And we want it signed,
sealed and delivered

01:13:03.606 --> 01:13:06.067
by a public figure
of substantial authority.

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.236
- How about the Prime Minister?
- Yeah, he'll do.

01:13:08.277 --> 01:13:11.072
If you can drag him off his yacht.

01:13:11.155 --> 01:13:12.949
You mess with us, Tim...

01:13:14.242 --> 01:13:16.369
we can drip-feed
pictures like this to the press.

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.334
We've got a stack of 'em.

01:13:25.169 --> 01:13:27.088
Oh, dear.

01:13:29.132 --> 01:13:31.509
You've got until 4:00 p.m.
To confirm we have a deal.

01:13:31.592 --> 01:13:33.094
We'll be in touch.

01:13:38.766 --> 01:13:41.477
- Some photographs.
- Well done, Tim.

01:13:55.241 --> 01:13:56.701
Do you have any more?

01:13:56.743 --> 01:13:58.745
Apparently, there was
a whole rogue's gallery

01:13:58.828 --> 01:14:00.830
stored in one of the boxes.

01:14:08.379 --> 01:14:10.631
If Lord Drysdale is up
to his usual hanky-panky,

01:14:10.715 --> 01:14:12.550
that's his problem.

01:14:12.592 --> 01:14:16.220
This operation is about recovering
the photos from Michael X.

01:14:16.304 --> 01:14:18.222
Might it not be prudent to get
the committee

01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:21.392
to consider issuing a D-Notice

01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:24.645
to protect everyone potentially
embarrassed by this criminal activity?

01:14:24.729 --> 01:14:26.272
Which we instigated.

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:34.739
Very nice. Very nice indeed.

01:14:35.823 --> 01:14:38.409
When I came out, there were
a couple of lads taking some photos.

01:14:39.952 --> 01:14:41.245
Photos of him.

01:14:41.287 --> 01:14:43.372
Now he was standing
right outside the bank

01:14:43.456 --> 01:14:45.166
just a few days
before it was robbed.

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:48.127
I thought at the time
he looked a bit shifty.

01:14:49.962 --> 01:14:51.547
Oh my God!

01:14:52.632 --> 01:14:54.258
Christ, is that thing real?

01:14:55.718 --> 01:14:57.762
I've got it: Dave Shilling.

01:14:57.804 --> 01:14:59.806
That's his name.

01:15:01.641 --> 01:15:03.351
- Ta-ta, Mum.
- Look after yourself, love.

01:15:05.144 --> 01:15:07.188
Go and get yourself inside,
you'll catch your death.

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.364
- Dave Shilling?
- Yeah?

01:15:16.447 --> 01:15:18.658
I wonder if we could have a word?

01:15:19.742 --> 01:15:21.786
- About what?
- About a bank.

01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:32.130
I want to tell you something,
Mr. Shilling, 'cause it'll save time.

01:15:33.589 --> 01:15:35.633
You see...

01:15:35.716 --> 01:15:37.593
I have a very
jaundiced view of life.

01:15:38.886 --> 01:15:42.348
From what I see, most of it's corrupt,
venal and vile.

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:45.268
And I'm just saying this so that you
know that I don't have

01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:47.979
a better nature to appeal to
or a compassionate streak.

01:15:48.062 --> 01:15:50.273
You do understand, don't you?

01:15:50.356 --> 01:15:52.358
- I think so, Mr. Vogel.
- Good.

01:15:56.863 --> 01:15:59.240
I have a kidney stone.

01:15:59.323 --> 01:16:01.492
I don't seem to be able to pass it.
I'm on painkillers.

01:16:03.119 --> 01:16:05.455
I could use a couple of those myself.

01:16:11.961 --> 01:16:13.880
You stole from me...

01:16:14.964 --> 01:16:17.175
and from friends of mine.

01:16:19.469 --> 01:16:22.180
- Where's my stuff?
- I don't know.

01:16:22.263 --> 01:16:25.433
Look, I don't know anything
about any bank robbery. Honest.

01:16:25.516 --> 01:16:28.436
Still an unconvincing actor,
Mr. Shilling.

01:16:37.403 --> 01:16:39.614
I would love to say
this is not going to hurt,

01:16:39.697 --> 01:16:42.116
but it is.

01:16:51.626 --> 01:16:53.127
What are you going to do?

01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:56.255
No no!

01:16:56.339 --> 01:16:58.257
No! Stop!

01:16:58.341 --> 01:16:59.801
Please!

01:16:59.842 --> 01:17:01.594
Don't! Please!

01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:11.354
- Well, they were here.
- Well, they ain't here now.

01:17:14.357 --> 01:17:15.858
Why is the door open?

01:17:21.572 --> 01:17:23.241
Who are you?

01:17:23.324 --> 01:17:25.118
I could ask the same thing.

01:17:25.201 --> 01:17:27.120
Better run along, eh?

01:17:27.203 --> 01:17:29.497
Get yourselves a cup of tea
or something.

01:17:40.758 --> 01:17:42.552
We're looking for Terry Leather.

01:17:42.593 --> 01:17:44.137
Terry said he won't be
coming in this week.

01:17:44.137 --> 01:17:46.514
- He's supposed to call in.
- Ah.

01:17:46.597 --> 01:17:48.224
So you'd be Eddie, right?

01:17:48.266 --> 01:17:51.477
- Uh, yeah.
- Well, you're coming with me.

01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:54.480
Leave him alone.
What do you want with my Eddie?

01:17:54.564 --> 01:17:56.232
- Shut your noise.
- Leave her alone!

01:17:56.315 --> 01:17:58.192
We want to talk to him
about a bank robbery.

01:17:58.276 --> 01:18:00.403
- Don't you touch her!
- If you want to see your Eddie

01:18:00.486 --> 01:18:02.655
or his mate Dave again, make sure
Terry Leather calls that number.

01:18:02.655 --> 01:18:04.031
What?

01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:06.743
Walkie-Talkie Gang takes it all!

01:18:06.826 --> 01:18:08.870
Read all about it!

01:18:08.953 --> 01:18:11.164
Walkie-Talkie Gang takes it all!

01:18:11.247 --> 01:18:13.166
That's great news. Over.

01:18:13.249 --> 01:18:15.960
We're taking a break.
We need to get some sleep,

01:18:16.002 --> 01:18:17.837
get a bit of shuteye
while the fumes clear out.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.298
- Over.
- Oh, lucky you.

01:18:20.339 --> 01:18:21.799
My eyes are like organ stops...

01:18:21.883 --> 01:18:24.343
Mummy, Daddy's on the radio.

01:18:24.427 --> 01:18:26.429
- Oh, don't be so silly, darling.
- He is!

01:18:27.889 --> 01:18:29.599
Is he?

01:18:29.682 --> 01:18:31.976
I want a warm bath
and a cup of tea. Over.

01:18:32.059 --> 01:18:35.188
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just you hold tight. Over.

01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:37.190
See, it is Daddy.

01:18:37.231 --> 01:18:38.816
Authorities have
released this recording

01:18:38.858 --> 01:18:40.359
of the walkie-talkie
communications

01:18:40.443 --> 01:18:42.904
between the robbers
of Lloyds Bank in Marylebone

01:18:42.987 --> 01:18:44.739
in the hopes that their voices
may be identified

01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:46.699
by members of the public...

01:18:46.783 --> 01:18:49.202
- Hello?
- Wendy?

01:18:50.328 --> 01:18:52.497
We heard you on the radio, Terry.
You're famous, you know?

01:18:52.538 --> 01:18:55.333
You robbed that bank, didn't you?
The one in the news?

01:18:55.374 --> 01:18:58.377
Oh God, you could go
to jail for years

01:18:58.461 --> 01:19:00.338
for something like that, Terry.
I couldn't stand it.

01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:03.424
No one's going to jail.
I've got it all under control.

01:19:03.508 --> 01:19:06.219
Just stay put,
keep the kids inside.

01:19:08.346 --> 01:19:10.264
I love you, Wendy.

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:12.892
I've got to go.

01:19:14.018 --> 01:19:16.104
- You be careful, Terry.
- What's the matter, Mum?

01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:19.273
Nothing, darling.

01:19:22.652 --> 01:19:25.988
Terry, they took Eddie.

01:19:26.072 --> 01:19:28.408
- Oh God, who?
- They weren't thieves or...

01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:32.328
I don't know, they could have been cops.
They left a phone number for you.

01:19:32.412 --> 01:19:34.122
They said if I wanted to see Dave

01:19:34.205 --> 01:19:36.457
or Eddie again
then you have to call.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.668
Listen to me, Ingrid.
I swear to you I'll get him back.

01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:41.087
- Don't you worry, darling.
- Have you got a pen?

01:19:41.129 --> 01:19:43.464
Yeah.

01:19:43.548 --> 01:19:46.634
- 0-1-9-4-6...
- Hold on, say it again.

01:19:46.717 --> 01:19:49.262
- 0-1-9-4-6...
- Yeah.

01:19:53.474 --> 01:19:55.935
- Michael, it's Lew Vogel.
- Yes?

01:19:55.977 --> 01:19:57.645
Well, we've identified the villains.

01:19:57.728 --> 01:20:01.149
And believe it or not,
they're amateurs. Part-timers.

01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:04.152
They were put up to the job by a woman
named Martine Love.

01:20:04.235 --> 01:20:06.320
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of her.

01:20:06.404 --> 01:20:07.822
Well, we paid a visit to her flat

01:20:07.864 --> 01:20:10.742
and some chaps
from Ml5 were already there.

01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:13.119
Pulled rank on my tamed copper.

01:20:14.662 --> 01:20:17.248
Why do you suppose these people
would be interested in the robbery

01:20:17.331 --> 01:20:19.000
of a minor neighborhood
bank, Michael?

01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:21.335
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

01:20:21.419 --> 01:20:24.922
And I'm guessing
that your box is number 118.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:28.968
I think what these robbers
were really after were photographs.

01:20:29.051 --> 01:20:31.471
Photographs
of a certain Royal Princess.

01:20:31.554 --> 01:20:33.264
How you know that?

01:20:33.347 --> 01:20:35.850
Because on this point
I believe my captive.

01:20:35.933 --> 01:20:38.394
No man could withstand
the pain we inflicted on him.

01:20:38.436 --> 01:20:41.063
So don't take me
for a fool, Michael.

01:20:41.147 --> 01:20:43.065
You've instigated this calamity

01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:45.359
by storing your blackmail materials
in this bank.

01:20:45.443 --> 01:20:47.653
Which you recommended.
I will not be lectured

01:20:47.737 --> 01:20:50.031
by the porn king of Soho.
Get my pictures back

01:20:50.073 --> 01:20:53.284
or you will never see a black man
on the streets of London

01:20:53.367 --> 01:20:55.661
without wondering if he's
been sent to kill you.

01:21:17.642 --> 01:21:20.103
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hello, Michael.

01:21:20.186 --> 01:21:22.605
Hakim was looking
for a copy of his book.

01:21:24.273 --> 01:21:27.026
I know what you've been looking for,
bird, and you won't find it.

01:21:28.319 --> 01:21:29.946
What are you talking about?

01:21:31.697 --> 01:21:34.117
Hakim, I found your book.

01:21:34.158 --> 01:21:36.369
You don't understand.

01:21:36.452 --> 01:21:38.871
My box and those of my friends

01:21:38.955 --> 01:21:41.374
may have been rifled.

01:21:41.457 --> 01:21:42.959
Surely you can pull some strings.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.128
You're a minister in the government,
for God's sake.

01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:47.755
Sonia, I really don't think
I'm able to help here.

01:21:47.839 --> 01:21:49.465
Perhaps you don't
fully comprehend.

01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:52.677
I have photographs,

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.387
compromising photographs,

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:56.973
live film of you,

01:21:57.014 --> 01:21:59.642
Miles Urquhart, all my regulars,

01:21:59.725 --> 01:22:02.520
in this safe deposit box.

01:22:02.562 --> 01:22:05.565
You all know each other,
if that's any consolation.

01:22:05.648 --> 01:22:07.817
You've got photographs of me?

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.236
You conniving cunt!

01:22:14.031 --> 01:22:16.534
You be a big boy.

01:22:16.617 --> 01:22:19.829
Now's the time to talk to
your Whitehall chums, don't you think?

01:22:22.248 --> 01:22:23.833
That's him. I'm sure that's him.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:27.587
Guy Arthur Singer.

01:22:27.628 --> 01:22:29.630
Con man and petty criminal.

01:22:29.714 --> 01:22:31.549
Did a stretch in the Scrubs
a few years back.

01:22:31.632 --> 01:22:34.093
Thought he was a wanker.
Spoke with some poncey accent.

01:22:36.179 --> 01:22:37.930
Thank you, sir, very much.

01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:47.231
- Hello?
- Who am I talking to?

01:22:47.273 --> 01:22:50.068
Oh, Terry Leather,
Kevin Swain, Martine Love,

01:22:50.151 --> 01:22:51.611
Eddie Burton.

01:22:51.694 --> 01:22:53.988
Yeah, Mr. Shilling was kind enough
to speak with me about this.

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:55.740
You put Dave on the phone, eh?

01:22:55.782 --> 01:22:57.909
Well, I would but...

01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:59.827
he seems a bit
indisposed at the moment.

01:23:00.912 --> 01:23:02.080
What do you want?

01:23:02.121 --> 01:23:04.248
Just a couple of things
from what you stole.

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:07.043
A ledger with a dark red cover.

01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:10.338
And some photos that I'm sure
Ml5 is interested in.

01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:13.007
The Royal Portfolio.

01:23:14.175 --> 01:23:16.135
All we got is money and jewels.

01:23:16.219 --> 01:23:18.429
Then I suggest you look again.

01:23:18.513 --> 01:23:20.681
Speak to your friends.

01:23:20.765 --> 01:23:23.184
- Hello. Who's this?
- Eddie? It's Terry.

01:23:23.267 --> 01:23:25.978
Terry. Terry, fucking hell.

01:23:27.146 --> 01:23:29.982
Dave's all messed up and they're
going to do the same to me.

01:23:30.066 --> 01:23:32.693
- You've got to help.
- Listen to me, Eddie.

01:23:32.777 --> 01:23:34.987
I don't have what he wants.

01:23:35.071 --> 01:23:36.864
What? No!

01:23:36.948 --> 01:23:39.659
No you've got to have
what they want, you've got to.

01:23:39.742 --> 01:23:41.285
You've got to help.

01:23:41.369 --> 01:23:44.080
Eddie, what am I supposed to do?
You tell him we don't have it.

01:23:44.163 --> 01:23:46.374
No, Terry!
Terry, you've got to help.

01:23:46.457 --> 01:23:49.085
Eddie, you tell him I don't
have his fucking ledger!

01:23:49.168 --> 01:23:51.671
You tell that cunt now.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.674
He doesn't have it.

01:23:54.715 --> 01:23:56.592
Right.

01:23:58.302 --> 01:24:00.763
What are you going to do?
No, don't!

01:24:00.847 --> 01:24:03.224
No! No!

01:24:03.266 --> 01:24:04.434
They shot Dave!

01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:06.144
- Eddie?
- Dave's dead.

01:24:06.227 --> 01:24:08.938
- Eddie! Eddie!
- They shot Dave.

01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:13.776
I'll give you one hour
to find what I want

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.737
or I'll kill this man too.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.213
Fuck.

01:24:34.297 --> 01:24:36.174
This is it.

01:24:38.301 --> 01:24:40.094
Lew Vogel.

01:24:40.178 --> 01:24:42.221
That's who this bastard is.

01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:47.477
Payments made
to Soho West End Division Officers.

01:24:50.021 --> 01:24:52.565
They're the weekly payouts.

01:24:52.648 --> 01:24:55.318
50 quid here, 20 there.

01:24:56.652 --> 01:24:58.488
Probably every
bent copper in London.

01:24:59.822 --> 01:25:01.908
Nothing like this
was supposed to happen.

01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:04.619
- No one was supposed to get hurt.
- It's not your fault.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.996
We've still got our own necks
to think about and Eddie.

01:25:07.038 --> 01:25:09.874
Look, we give the photos to Vogel,
all bets are off with Tim.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:13.336
We deliver them to Tim,
it's Eddie's neck,

01:25:13.419 --> 01:25:14.962
Vogel and his lot are after us.

01:25:15.046 --> 01:25:17.340
Either way, we are fucked.

01:25:21.177 --> 01:25:23.805
Miles, we've got a problem,

01:25:23.888 --> 01:25:25.431
a serious problem...

01:25:25.515 --> 01:25:27.141
something Sonia Burn
kept in the bank

01:25:27.225 --> 01:25:29.102
that was robbed
over the weekend.

01:25:29.185 --> 01:25:31.104
She is concerned
that her safe deposit box

01:25:31.187 --> 01:25:32.688
may have been plundered.

01:25:32.772 --> 01:25:35.608
I'm afraid her fears
are well justified.

01:25:36.943 --> 01:25:38.903
Oh my God.

01:25:38.945 --> 01:25:41.989
I really thought Sonia was a woman
of more discreet character.

01:25:43.825 --> 01:25:45.743
So...

01:25:45.827 --> 01:25:47.537
the genie is out
of the bottle then.

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.080
For both of us, eh?

01:25:49.163 --> 01:25:52.041
Not quite yet.
My operatives tell me

01:25:52.083 --> 01:25:55.628
that the thieves are using
the photographs as a bargaining chip.

01:25:55.711 --> 01:25:58.798
- Then give them what they want.
- Already in motion.

01:25:58.881 --> 01:26:00.341
And the committee
have it in the works

01:26:00.425 --> 01:26:03.511
to issue a D-Notice
on the whole business...

01:26:04.595 --> 01:26:06.472
muffle the press,

01:26:06.556 --> 01:26:08.182
put a lid on it.

01:26:17.191 --> 01:26:18.735
What?

01:26:47.388 --> 01:26:49.140
Be a pity, wouldn't it?

01:26:49.182 --> 01:26:52.727
I mean, if your mates abandoned
you over a few photographs and...

01:27:00.318 --> 01:27:03.863
- Hello.
- You listen to me, Mr. Vogel,

01:27:03.946 --> 01:27:06.699
or whatever your fucking name is.
You go ahead and kill him.

01:27:06.783 --> 01:27:08.951
See if we give a shit.
We got our loot.

01:27:09.035 --> 01:27:12.872
Your ledgers and your photos, you can
pick them up from Scotland Yard.

01:27:12.955 --> 01:27:15.166
- We're sending them over.
- Don't do that.

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:18.086
Well, if you want your
book of payoffs back,

01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:20.880
be at Paddington Station
in person tomorrow 11:00 a.m.

01:27:20.963 --> 01:27:22.423
Platform one.

01:27:22.507 --> 01:27:26.385
There's a news stand
near the statue of the soldier.

01:27:26.427 --> 01:27:28.805
Have Eddie with you,
hale and hearty.

01:27:28.888 --> 01:27:31.140
This is your one
and only chance, Vogel.

01:27:31.224 --> 01:27:32.725
Don't blow it.

01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:53.621
Don't answer it! Catherine!

01:27:53.704 --> 01:27:56.124
- Daddy!
- Hello, you. Come here.

01:27:59.585 --> 01:28:01.963
Here look, I got you a present.

01:28:02.004 --> 01:28:03.965
- You been good for Mummy?
- Yeah.

01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:12.515
I need to talk to Mummy about something,
so give us a minute, okay?

01:28:12.598 --> 01:28:14.559
- Go on.
- Go on.

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:28.281
So do you want to tell me
what's been going on?

01:28:30.074 --> 01:28:31.617
Some bloke's worked over Dave.

01:28:31.701 --> 01:28:33.619
How bad?

01:28:34.746 --> 01:28:36.497
He's dead.

01:28:36.581 --> 01:28:39.250
Oh my God almighty, Terry!

01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:40.793
What have you done to us?

01:28:40.877 --> 01:28:43.296
Wendy, I promise,

01:28:43.379 --> 01:28:44.797
I'm going to work this out.

01:28:44.881 --> 01:28:46.674
And when I do,
we're going to leave England

01:28:46.758 --> 01:28:48.301
and it is all going
to change for us.

01:28:50.678 --> 01:28:52.430
If anything goes wrong, use this.

01:28:52.513 --> 01:28:54.056
There's plenty of cash...

01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.267
pounds, francs, dollars.

01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:59.020
You can leave the country,
start a new life for you and the girls.

01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:01.189
You can do this
if you have to, Wendy.

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.733
- Promise me.
- That from the robbery, is it?

01:29:05.818 --> 01:29:07.111
My share, yeah.

01:29:07.195 --> 01:29:09.822
The papers said
that there was a woman in the vault.

01:29:09.906 --> 01:29:12.241
Martine was it,
was she involved?

01:29:12.283 --> 01:29:14.744
Yeah, she brought us
the job in the first place.

01:29:14.786 --> 01:29:16.788
Oh, and did you
sleep with her, Terry?

01:29:25.922 --> 01:29:29.092
Do you know what?
From day one it was always you.

01:29:29.175 --> 01:29:31.594
The first day we met,
I said to my friend Audrey,

01:29:31.636 --> 01:29:33.930
I said,
"I am going to marry him.

01:29:34.013 --> 01:29:36.432
And I am going to have his kids."

01:29:36.516 --> 01:29:38.559
And I have stuck by you.

01:29:38.643 --> 01:29:40.895
I have stuck by you no matter what!

01:29:40.978 --> 01:29:42.897
You bastard!

01:29:46.943 --> 01:29:48.611
Fuck.

01:29:56.619 --> 01:29:58.287
You can throw me over.

01:29:59.497 --> 01:30:01.040
I deserve it.

01:30:02.708 --> 01:30:04.877
I've brought you more grief
than happiness.

01:30:04.961 --> 01:30:08.089
But I love you and the kids.

01:30:10.633 --> 01:30:13.553
That's the reason I did this, to get us
out of this life once and for all.

01:30:14.595 --> 01:30:16.264
Mummy, open the door!

01:30:20.226 --> 01:30:21.978
- Mummy, Mummy!
- We'll work the rest out later.

01:30:22.019 --> 01:30:23.771
Go and play in your room!

01:30:26.941 --> 01:30:28.484
If you'll still have me.

01:30:52.967 --> 01:30:54.427
She takes a good picture, eh, Tim?

01:30:56.345 --> 01:30:58.181
Lord Mountbatten has
graciously agreed to represent

01:30:58.222 --> 01:31:00.016
the interests of the Crown
in this matter.

01:31:00.099 --> 01:31:02.977
- He high enough up the tree?
- Lord Mountbatten?

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.812
I've always wanted
to meet that bugger.

01:31:04.896 --> 01:31:06.981
Yes. Well, I'm sure he'll be
very pleased to meet you too.

01:31:06.981 --> 01:31:08.900
He has to be under the main clock,
Paddington Station,

01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:10.318
11:00 a.m. Or no deal.

01:31:10.401 --> 01:31:13.613
11:00 a.m. On the knocker with your
new passports and documents.

01:31:13.654 --> 01:31:15.865
He'll hand them over
as soon as he sees the photos.

01:31:15.948 --> 01:31:17.450
There's another problem.

01:31:17.533 --> 01:31:19.619
This robbery has pissed off
some local villains.

01:31:19.702 --> 01:31:21.412
The guts come with the glory, eh?

01:31:21.496 --> 01:31:23.790
One of our mates has been killed.

01:31:23.873 --> 01:31:26.084
It's hardly surprising
considering the roster of reprobates

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:28.961
who are the bank's
deposit box customers.

01:31:29.003 --> 01:31:30.671
Listen, Terry, our commitment
is for the recovery

01:31:30.671 --> 01:31:32.465
of the royal portraits only.

01:31:32.507 --> 01:31:35.134
The proceeds and the piss-offs
are both yours to deal with.

01:31:39.597 --> 01:31:42.475
11:00 a.m., Paddington Station.

01:31:55.029 --> 01:31:56.823
Gale,

01:31:56.906 --> 01:31:59.075
Michael wants
to see you in the garden.

01:31:59.158 --> 01:32:00.660
- What for?
- I don't know.

01:32:06.999 --> 01:32:08.501
Gale, come.
Come and look at this.

01:32:09.794 --> 01:32:11.546
Come.

01:32:13.047 --> 01:32:16.008
- I want to show you something.
- What's this for?

01:32:18.219 --> 01:32:20.471
It's for you.

01:32:20.555 --> 01:32:22.682
What have I done to deserve this?
What have I done?

01:32:22.723 --> 01:32:25.226
You're a spy
sent to steal from me.

01:32:25.309 --> 01:32:28.855
And nobody steals from Michael X!
No one!

01:32:32.817 --> 01:32:34.861
See if it mentions
the copper in charge.

01:32:38.114 --> 01:32:39.907
Here it is. "Heading the case"

01:32:39.949 --> 01:32:43.244
is Detective Sergeant Roy Given
of Marylebone Lane Police Station."

01:32:45.079 --> 01:32:46.539
Roy Given.

01:32:47.623 --> 01:32:49.459
No Roy Given mentioned.

01:32:50.543 --> 01:32:52.170
Let's hope that means he's straight.

01:32:52.253 --> 01:32:54.672
And that he'd be interested
in the names of some bent coppers.

01:32:54.756 --> 01:32:56.632
Yeah, bit of a long shot.

01:32:59.802 --> 01:33:01.387
- Fuck it.
- Nothing in that one?

01:33:01.471 --> 01:33:02.930
No.

01:33:04.891 --> 01:33:06.684
What, we don't rate a mention?

01:33:06.768 --> 01:33:08.269
Strike you as strange?

01:33:08.311 --> 01:33:09.937
It's kind of scary actually.

01:33:10.021 --> 01:33:12.273
If that news could disappear,
so could we.

01:33:13.566 --> 01:33:15.693
Next stop, Edgeware Road.

01:33:15.777 --> 01:33:17.904
Well, here's to us.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.367
See you, mate.

01:33:23.451 --> 01:33:25.328
Look after yourself. Take care.

01:33:26.454 --> 01:33:28.206
Good luck, Kev.

01:33:38.091 --> 01:33:40.718
So where are you headed
if everything goes to plan?

01:33:43.554 --> 01:33:45.598
I'll tell you
if you're coming with me.

01:34:03.908 --> 01:34:06.536
Morning.
I'm looking for a Mr. Roy Given.

01:34:06.577 --> 01:34:09.205
- It's very important.
- Roy Given?

01:34:09.288 --> 01:34:10.957
Yeah.

01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:14.127
Yeah, well, can I ask
what it's concerning?

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:15.753
No, I prefer to tell him myself.

01:34:15.837 --> 01:34:17.964
Look, all I'm saying is
if you're interested

01:34:18.047 --> 01:34:20.591
in the rest of this book of payoffs,
the author's going to be

01:34:20.675 --> 01:34:23.344
at Paddington Station, 11:00 a.m.,
platform one.

01:34:23.428 --> 01:34:26.389
And how exactly did this
come into your possession?

01:34:26.472 --> 01:34:28.099
Next stop, Paddington Station.

01:34:28.182 --> 01:34:30.268
Change here
for the Bakerloo Line.

01:34:30.351 --> 01:34:32.645
Let's hope no one turns up
fashionably late.

01:34:47.994 --> 01:34:50.121
- There's your friend Tim.
- Good luck.

01:35:03.551 --> 01:35:05.470
It's good to see you in one piece.

01:35:05.511 --> 01:35:07.513
You were worried
for your own ass, Tim,

01:35:07.597 --> 01:35:09.265
not for mine.

01:35:17.857 --> 01:35:19.400
You're a prick, Tim.

01:35:19.484 --> 01:35:21.652
You set this whole thing up
from the start, didn't you?

01:35:21.694 --> 01:35:23.362
Come on, you get to be rich,
free and clear.

01:35:23.362 --> 01:35:25.698
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:35:48.971 --> 01:35:51.140
- You stay here with the car.
- Right.

01:35:51.224 --> 01:35:54.102
Oh, bloody kidney stone.

01:35:54.143 --> 01:35:55.645
It's got to pass soon.

01:36:42.942 --> 01:36:45.403
Haven't had this much
excitement since the war.

01:36:45.486 --> 01:36:46.946
We're a little late, milord.

01:36:58.166 --> 01:36:59.625
So where's your mate?

01:36:59.709 --> 01:37:01.794
That's Terry there
by the news stand.

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:10.845
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys
before at the girl's flat.

01:37:10.887 --> 01:37:13.222
- It's a trap. They're Ml5.
- Terry!

01:37:13.264 --> 01:37:14.724
Terry!

01:37:24.067 --> 01:37:25.818
- Lord Mountbatten?
- Yes.

01:37:25.902 --> 01:37:27.945
You know the arrangement?
And you agreed

01:37:28.029 --> 01:37:30.573
to our new identities
and immunity from prosecution?

01:37:30.656 --> 01:37:33.284
You have my word that the Crown
will honor this commitment.

01:37:33.367 --> 01:37:35.244
Your documentation
and guarantees.

01:37:38.998 --> 01:37:41.250
If I were you I'd keep them
in a very safe place.

01:37:41.334 --> 01:37:44.087
Yeah, well you can bet
it won't be a safe deposit box.

01:37:52.804 --> 01:37:55.556
She is a scallywag. Thank you.

01:38:01.813 --> 01:38:03.815
Martine...

01:38:03.898 --> 01:38:05.358
it wasn't all business for me.

01:38:10.279 --> 01:38:12.573
- What's happening? Where's the book?
- Just open the door.

01:38:12.657 --> 01:38:14.200
- No!
- Get in there.

01:38:14.283 --> 01:38:16.119
Stay there or you're dead meat.

01:38:20.665 --> 01:38:22.542
Where you going, old man, eh?

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.422
- This one's for Dave.
- No.

01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:30.675
Here, you fucker!

01:38:32.093 --> 01:38:33.719
Not so fucking smug now are you?

01:38:40.768 --> 01:38:42.311
Oi, you sod...

01:39:20.099 --> 01:39:22.602
- Eddie, get out.
- That's the bloke that killed Dave.

01:39:22.643 --> 01:39:24.228
Get your hands off me!

01:39:25.396 --> 01:39:27.106
Arrest them.
They're the bank robbers.

01:39:27.148 --> 01:39:28.733
- Fuck!
- This bloke killed our friend.

01:39:28.816 --> 01:39:30.860
- Shit.
- We're innocent.

01:39:41.746 --> 01:39:43.456
So are we seriously
assholed now, Terry?

01:39:43.498 --> 01:39:46.000
Well, at least we're not dead
like poor old Dave.

01:39:49.253 --> 01:39:52.006
- Get up, you filthy bastard.
- I want...

01:39:52.090 --> 01:39:53.883
You're under arrest.

01:39:53.966 --> 01:39:55.968
- Take him away.
- Right. Come on you.

01:39:57.011 --> 01:39:58.554
Get in the car.

01:40:04.268 --> 01:40:05.520
I tried, mate.

01:40:13.945 --> 01:40:15.696
I wonder if that's Roy Given.

01:40:19.033 --> 01:40:20.660
Who's he?

01:40:20.701 --> 01:40:23.371
We was hoping
he was a straight copper.

01:40:25.164 --> 01:40:27.041
We've got a nice collar here, Roy.

01:40:27.083 --> 01:40:29.877
You know these two are part
of the Baker Street bank robbery gang?

01:40:29.961 --> 01:40:31.712
- Place this man under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

01:40:31.754 --> 01:40:34.424
What are you talking about?
They're part of the Baker Street firm.

01:40:34.507 --> 01:40:36.509
I don't know about them,
but I know about you,

01:40:36.592 --> 01:40:38.386
you corrupt bastard. Cuff him...

01:40:38.469 --> 01:40:40.555
and the one over
by the wall as well.

01:40:40.596 --> 01:40:42.598
But they're the robbers.

01:40:43.891 --> 01:40:45.393
No robbers in here.

01:40:45.476 --> 01:40:47.103
Watch your head.

01:40:47.186 --> 01:40:48.521
Now...

01:40:48.604 --> 01:40:51.899
I believe you have
a certain Mr. Vogel's book of shame.

01:40:51.941 --> 01:40:54.444
Well, if you'll let me out,
I'll go get it for you.

01:40:58.614 --> 01:41:00.450
That belongs to me.

01:41:06.664 --> 01:41:08.207
There's your book.

01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:10.877
Terry, we were thinking,
a smart fellow like you

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.628
might have kept mementos
of the event just in case.

01:41:12.628 --> 01:41:15.965
In case what?
Things didn't turn out so nicely?

01:41:16.007 --> 01:41:17.717
If they should ever
see the light of day,

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.260
don't think we can't find you.

01:41:26.601 --> 01:41:29.062
Out! Go on, piss off!

01:41:30.146 --> 01:41:31.689
And you, go on.

01:41:31.773 --> 01:41:33.649
- How did that happen?
- Fucked if I know.

01:41:33.691 --> 01:41:35.318
Just keep walking.

01:41:45.203 --> 01:41:47.246
Michael! Michael!

01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:52.710
What's going on?

01:41:52.794 --> 01:41:54.712
What do you want in my place?

01:41:54.754 --> 01:41:56.798
- What do you want?
- We are placing you under arrest.

01:41:56.839 --> 01:41:58.299
What am I charged with?

01:41:58.382 --> 01:42:00.551
Conspiracy to import drugs
into the United Kingdom.

01:42:00.635 --> 01:42:02.637
Will that do?
But you could still help yourself.

01:42:03.888 --> 01:42:05.598
There's a British national
staying with you,

01:42:05.681 --> 01:42:09.102
- a certain Gale Benson.
- She was here but she's gone on.

01:42:13.815 --> 01:42:15.400
All right.

01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:27.662
Over here, sir.

01:42:46.472 --> 01:42:49.517
Burn the house down. I want
nothing of this place left standing.

01:43:10.997 --> 01:43:13.833
We knew him
in a professional capacity.

01:43:14.834 --> 01:43:16.210
He was one of our favorites.

01:43:17.253 --> 01:43:19.213
See you later.

01:43:20.298 --> 01:43:22.049
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:43:22.133 --> 01:43:24.844
So where are you off to, Kev?

01:43:24.886 --> 01:43:26.721
Anywhere you want to go.

01:43:26.804 --> 01:43:29.223
Sorry, I'm doing a solo
from now on.

01:43:30.349 --> 01:43:32.226
Yeah, well it was worth a try.

01:43:33.311 --> 01:43:34.812
Do you want another one?

01:43:34.896 --> 01:43:36.898
Yeah, go on. One for the road.

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.025
Ta, mate.

01:43:42.236 --> 01:43:44.280
I just wish Dave
could have seen all this.

01:43:44.363 --> 01:43:45.740
Yeah, here's to Dave.

01:43:45.823 --> 01:43:47.241
To Dave.

01:43:55.333 --> 01:43:57.794
What do you want, Martine?

01:43:57.877 --> 01:44:00.213
I'm sorry I've caused you
this upset, Wendy.

01:44:00.254 --> 01:44:02.256
Well, apparently we're rich.

01:44:04.342 --> 01:44:07.637
I know the business is finished,
but are the cars really ours?

01:44:11.099 --> 01:44:12.934
Yeah.

01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:17.063
They're all yours.

01:44:17.146 --> 01:44:18.731
Jessell's been paid off.

01:44:20.608 --> 01:44:23.736
I won't lie to you.
I'd have gone with him.

01:44:24.862 --> 01:44:27.156
And I'd have shut you
out of my mind.

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.325
But he didn't want to know.

01:44:34.831 --> 01:44:36.624
I'm sorry.

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:41.337
Your wife's talking to Martine.

01:44:41.421 --> 01:44:43.131
I know, Kev.

01:44:43.172 --> 01:44:44.841
I know.

01:44:47.343 --> 01:44:49.053
Good luck.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.862
It was always you, Terry.

01:45:35.224 --> 01:45:37.060
Go, Daddy!

01:45:38.186 --> 01:45:40.146
Oh my God, Terry,
it's a big one.

01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:42.356
Last us a few chips, that one.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.400
Don't, Mom.
