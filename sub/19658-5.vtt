WEBVTT

00:02.028 --> 00:04.955
Good news, Grand Commissioner.
We have located the target.

00:04.981 --> 00:08.826
<i>I remind you, Peter Quill,
that this "target" is my daughter.</i>

00:08.851 --> 00:10.826
<i>And she must arrive on Rigel-3</i>

00:10.851 --> 00:13.102
<i>in time for her
coming-of-age ceremony.</i>

00:13.127 --> 00:16.709
<i>I expect you to treat her with the
respect that befits her station.</i>

00:16.734 --> 00:18.194
Ha, don't worry.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.146
Drax and Gamora will flush her out.

00:20.171 --> 00:21.583
And then...

00:22.940 --> 00:27.015
Rocket, the Rigellian Grand Commissioner
is paying us four million units

00:27.047 --> 00:31.431
to escort his daughter,
the princess, home.

00:31.456 --> 00:34.492
Yeah? This is my fanciest sack!

00:34.517 --> 00:36.197
I am Groot!

00:36.222 --> 00:38.412
Good point, bud.
She ain't gonna care.

00:38.437 --> 00:40.436
Rigellians got no emotions!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.055
Stop, Princess.
I mean you no harm.

00:49.523 --> 00:51.746
Who... Who are you?

00:51.771 --> 00:53.681
I am Drax the Destroyer.

00:54.224 --> 00:55.690
"Destroyer"?

00:56.683 --> 00:59.278
Uh, but perhaps you should
address me as simply Drax.

00:59.303 --> 01:03.012
Oh, hey, Drax? Don't forget,
Rigellians are telekinetic.

01:03.995 --> 01:07.207
She is making that fact
extremely difficult to forget.

01:15.305 --> 01:17.117
Quill, we have a problem.

01:17.142 --> 01:19.753
<i>Princess Tana has taken
refuge in the one place</i>

01:19.778 --> 01:22.020
<i>even Drax the Destroyer dare not enter.</i>

01:22.358 --> 01:25.076
Yo, Quill!
What's the deal? Huh?

01:25.111 --> 01:27.687
Trying to snatch my best customer?

01:27.713 --> 01:31.220
Lu! Hey!
Long time no see, buddy.

01:31.254 --> 01:32.931
Don't "buddy" me!

01:33.127 --> 01:37.015
That wrecking ball you call
Drax is trashing my club!

01:37.040 --> 01:38.738
You want Princess T?

01:38.771 --> 01:41.405
You're gonna have to go through me!

01:41.549 --> 01:42.781
Works for me.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.690
Works for me, too.

01:44.715 --> 01:46.396
And so does he!

01:47.763 --> 01:49.683
Okay, this doesn't work for me.

Yo, Draxy! We could use
your destroying skills out here!

02:08.860 --> 02:11.386
I have a delicate situation in here.

02:13.924 --> 02:16.246
Never mind.
We'll just come to you.

02:18.956 --> 02:21.229
Princess Tana, I presume?

02:22.019 --> 02:23.069
What...

02:23.592 --> 02:25.481
Who... How...

02:25.997 --> 02:28.994
Think you're the first club-crawler
to sneak out a bathroom window?

02:29.019 --> 02:31.526
Let go! I have a right to party!

02:31.551 --> 02:33.192
You remind me of Peter Quill.

02:33.217 --> 02:35.468
- Who?
- It's not a compliment.

02:39.557 --> 02:42.286
- Quill, she's on the move!
- I am Groot!

02:44.196 --> 02:45.332
I saw nothing!

02:45.943 --> 02:47.710
Please resume powdering your noses.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.841
Or other breathing appendages.

02:50.172 --> 02:52.182
I am Groot!

02:58.356 --> 03:01.991
If you do not cooperate, you will miss
your coming-of-age ceremony.

03:02.016 --> 03:02.816
Well, duh!

03:02.841 --> 03:05.116
Why do you think I'm on
Conjunction in the first place?

03:05.141 --> 03:08.863
Apparently, to behave monstrously
and spend your father's money.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.292
And in two days, I will
officially be an adult.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.912
Then nobody can make me
go through the Centering!

03:16.162 --> 03:17.207
Huh?

03:18.347 --> 03:21.402
Then it is fortunate we will
get you home before that time.

03:25.175 --> 03:27.011
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

03:33.253 --> 03:36.211
Behold! Your transport
home has arrived.

03:39.730 --> 03:42.580
Know what would've been helpful,
El Commissioner Grand-a-mentay?

03:42.999 --> 03:45.137
Warning us the princess
is a hard-partying,

03:45.162 --> 03:47.231
ship-stealing,
out-of-control brat!

03:47.256 --> 03:48.607
I mean, respectful.

03:48.632 --> 03:52.562
<i>Admittedly, she is rather an
embarrassment to the royal family.</i>

03:52.587 --> 03:55.613
<i>But I dispense information
on a need-to-know basis.</i>

03:55.638 --> 03:58.875
<i>Speaking of which,
a group of Rigellian rebels,</i>

03:58.900 --> 04:01.047
<i>calling themselves "The Empathetics"</i>

04:01.072 --> 04:02.671
<i>are based somewhere in the system,</i>

04:02.696 --> 04:05.424
<i>so do try to avoid contact with them.</i>

04:05.576 --> 04:10.496
<i>It is imperative that Tana be home
in time to undergo the Centering.</i>

04:10.521 --> 04:13.470
- Anything else?
- <i>Try not to antagonize her.</i>

04:13.495 --> 04:16.916
<i>Negative emotions will
manifest in unfortunate ways.</i>

04:21.440 --> 04:22.966
I hate you!

04:22.991 --> 04:24.379
Leave me alone!

04:28.474 --> 04:33.442
Hey! I don't take kindly to temper tantrums
that cause explosive decompression!

04:33.467 --> 04:37.271
So, knock it off, or spend the rest
of the trip in a pocket dimension.

04:38.586 --> 04:40.525
That will not be necessary.

04:40.793 --> 04:42.301
Please, don't take me home.

04:42.326 --> 04:45.426
You don't understand what it's
like to deal with a strict father.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.857
I was raised by the Mad Titan, Thanos.

04:47.882 --> 04:50.672
I helped bury him
at the center of a planet.

04:51.655 --> 04:54.016
That is awesome.

04:54.303 --> 04:56.961
But, look. I can make it
worth your while.

04:56.986 --> 04:58.502
Enough talk of escape.

04:58.527 --> 05:00.683
We swore an oath
to the Grand Commissioner.

05:00.708 --> 05:02.392
I am Groot.

05:02.417 --> 05:03.906
Go that right, bud.

05:03.931 --> 05:07.445
We didn't swear no oath.
What ya offering?

05:07.573 --> 05:10.057
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double.

05:10.082 --> 05:11.229
Oh.

05:11.254 --> 05:12.769
He closed my account!

05:12.794 --> 05:15.812
Oh, well. Plan "A" it is.

05:15.837 --> 05:18.035
Back to Daddy's lovin' arms.

05:18.132 --> 05:20.005
If you try to force me home,

05:20.030 --> 05:24.043
I'll make your lives so miserable
you'll have to get rid of me.

05:24.068 --> 05:27.668
We've faced some of the
worst lowlifes in the galaxy.

05:27.693 --> 05:29.576
Nothing you can do can faze us.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.974
Worry not.
I will watch over her.

05:37.219 --> 05:38.122
Oh!

05:39.848 --> 05:41.555
Who's gonna watch over you?

05:52.315 --> 05:54.661
I am Groot.

06:02.031 --> 06:03.740
I will clean that up for you.

06:05.547 --> 06:07.236
Perhaps you can reuse them.

06:09.872 --> 06:12.572
Oh! Come on, Princess!

06:12.606 --> 06:15.265
- Time to get off the throne!
- My eyeballs are floatin' here!

06:16.696 --> 06:17.460
Let me in!

06:20.545 --> 06:22.469
Out, now.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.433
I will handle this.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.437
- Out of my way, Quill!
- I gotta go!

06:30.725 --> 06:31.991
But I gotta go more!

06:36.441 --> 06:37.397
Whoa!

06:39.997 --> 06:41.252
Hey! Hey!

06:41.277 --> 06:43.445
Those are my grenades you're juggling!

06:48.638 --> 06:52.549
Princess, you should not tamper
with dangerous explosives, or rodents.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.802
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

07:08.140 --> 07:11.059
You did that on purpose!

07:11.156 --> 07:12.353
Allow me.

07:12.783 --> 07:15.940
I have observed you perform
this Earth ritual many times.

07:20.972 --> 07:22.914
Your actions toward us are hostile,

07:22.949 --> 07:24.746
but your face displays fear.

07:24.885 --> 07:28.028
Is this related to the Centering
ceremony you wish to avoid?

07:28.063 --> 07:29.779
What do you know about it?

07:29.920 --> 07:32.452
My people also have
a coming-of-age ritual.

07:32.549 --> 07:35.092
One my own daughter would
be undertaking about now.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.002
She would be roughly your age.

07:37.255 --> 07:39.707
So what? Am I supposed to care?

07:39.874 --> 07:42.392
That's it! You're nothing
but a spoiled brat.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.965
And you, a spineless coddler!

07:44.990 --> 07:47.633
I was raised by Thanos, you
little <i> gronkah.</i>

07:47.658 --> 07:51.459
You're a princess! You're supposed
to set an example for your people!

07:51.484 --> 07:52.626
But you can't,

07:52.651 --> 07:55.903
because you don't care about
anyone's feelings but your own!

07:56.684 --> 07:58.399
Well, they're my feelings!

07:58.424 --> 08:00.216
You can't take them from me!

08:00.241 --> 08:03.028
Ship's hull can't take
much more of this stress!

08:04.022 --> 08:07.416
I hate you! Leave me alone!

08:09.258 --> 08:11.456
I am Groot!

08:11.525 --> 08:13.534
Never having kids.

08:17.357 --> 08:19.671
Yo, Groot, put a cork
in that hull breach!

08:26.094 --> 08:29.577
I remember what Yondu would tell me
whenever I put a hole in his ship.

08:29.841 --> 08:32.482
"You need to go nighty-night,
boy-o."

08:36.344 --> 08:38.543
Oh, man! Blew right back in my face.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.403
I won't let you take me home.

08:45.428 --> 08:47.689
I'll wreck your whole
ship if I have to!

08:48.093 --> 08:49.667
Not gonna happen.

08:49.704 --> 08:51.313
Groot, uncork!

08:56.701 --> 08:59.393
Rocket, you just sent
the princess into space!

08:59.677 --> 09:02.639
We don't get paid if she
explodes in a vacuum.

09:02.824 --> 09:05.835
That's why I got the sack.

09:17.021 --> 09:18.544
Ah, you have awakened.

09:20.799 --> 09:23.572
- What happened?
- You threw a tantrum,

09:23.861 --> 09:26.402
as would my own daughter when
she was tired or hungry.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.360
This is Mr. Rhinopus.

09:28.528 --> 09:30.241
He belonged to my Camaria.

09:30.697 --> 09:32.867
She would've been
around your age had she...

09:34.490 --> 09:37.140
I thought perhaps he would
make you feel better.

09:42.486 --> 09:44.965
You have rested.
Now you must eat.

09:48.431 --> 09:50.586
Why are you being nice to me?

09:50.622 --> 09:52.818
I am concerned
for your well-being.

09:52.987 --> 09:54.136
I'm not hungry.

09:54.259 --> 09:55.997
Your behavior suggests otherwise.

09:56.022 --> 09:57.480
Don't tell me what to do!

10:00.236 --> 10:03.825
Why is a nearly-adult Rigellian
so unable to control herself,

10:03.860 --> 10:05.935
or her telekinetic abilities?

10:06.514 --> 10:08.731
You sound just like my dad!

10:09.824 --> 10:11.934
Your father sounds like a wise man.

10:11.968 --> 10:13.622
Well, he's not, okay?

10:13.730 --> 10:16.486
And I don't care what he says.
I won't do the Centering.

10:16.511 --> 10:18.339
Just... Just let me go.

10:18.364 --> 10:19.875
You could say I knocked you out.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.211
Drax the Destroyer does not
lie, or get knocked out.

10:23.236 --> 10:25.261
I thought you cared about me.

10:25.286 --> 10:28.367
This is why I will not let you run
out on your responsibilities.

10:28.392 --> 10:29.843
Just like your father will not.

10:29.868 --> 10:32.878
Right. Like you're
such a great dad.

10:32.914 --> 10:35.717
Where's your precious
little Camaria now?

10:35.742 --> 10:39.677
- Oh, that's right. She's...
- You do not speak her name!

10:39.712 --> 10:43.357
She was taken from me by Ronan!

10:43.435 --> 10:47.317
And this is all you have
to remember her by?

10:52.207 --> 10:54.425
No!

10:57.168 --> 10:59.039
Drax, are you all right?

10:59.482 --> 11:01.998
I am unharmed, physically.

11:04.441 --> 11:05.854
The princess flew the coop.

11:05.889 --> 11:07.372
We are not letting all those units...

11:07.407 --> 11:09.820
I mean, "Tana" get away.

11:09.845 --> 11:11.131
I will retrieve her.

11:11.156 --> 11:13.297
I am at fault for letting her escape.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.841
Yeah. And how'd that happen?

11:18.570 --> 11:20.735
I am Groot!

11:20.839 --> 11:22.931
Not Mr. Rhinopus!

11:23.799 --> 11:25.214
I'm going with you.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.410
That brat will pay for this.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.751
Her pod signal's this way.

11:38.002 --> 11:40.911
Empathetics, ready...

11:42.359 --> 11:46.285
Aim and fire!

11:50.002 --> 11:53.309
Aw, come on! You
can do better than that!

11:53.344 --> 11:55.630
Let's bring some pain!

12:00.985 --> 12:04.241
This is not what I expected.

12:04.302 --> 12:08.031
I can see why the Grand Commissioner
wants Tana to control her powers.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.704
So good! So good!

12:12.739 --> 12:15.357
- Oh, yeah! Oh, I love it!
- Excuse me.

12:15.382 --> 12:18.240
- What did I tell you? That girl is crazy!
- Excuse me!

12:18.265 --> 12:20.386
- She's nuts! I love her!
- Have you seen...

12:20.411 --> 12:22.498
- Hey!
- Back off!

12:36.625 --> 12:38.300
What is so funny?

12:40.688 --> 12:44.778
That was awesome for a flatliner.

12:44.803 --> 12:47.365
You know, a non-TK-er.

12:48.818 --> 12:52.079
Who are you people, and why
the random destruction?

12:52.162 --> 12:54.730
Name's Jukka. We're Empathetics.

12:54.849 --> 12:59.283
And this is hardcore training for,
like, revolution and whatnot.

12:59.319 --> 13:02.853
You overgrown children
are the Rigellian rebels?

13:02.888 --> 13:05.906
Flarg, yeah, we're rebels!
Fight the power!

13:05.931 --> 13:08.546
And, oh, you might wanna look down.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.325
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

13:17.682 --> 13:19.724
Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!

13:34.110 --> 13:37.240
It is unsportsmanlike to crush
your friend when he is down.

13:37.268 --> 13:39.108
Whatever, Grandpa.

13:42.568 --> 13:43.336
Whoo-hoo!

13:43.361 --> 13:44.813
- Tana!
- Whoo!

13:44.839 --> 13:46.923
Why would you endanger
your life like this?

13:46.948 --> 13:49.836
I'm having fun.
Lighten up. Whoo!

13:49.869 --> 13:52.844
I would never allow my daughter
to behave so irresponsibly.

13:52.868 --> 13:57.347
I am not your daughter!

14:02.198 --> 14:05.023
- This geezer bothering you, Tana?
- Yeah.

14:05.059 --> 14:07.264
He's ruining everything.

14:07.595 --> 14:09.612
This does not concern you.

14:09.647 --> 14:11.236
I think it does.

14:11.349 --> 14:15.456
Empathetics, you know what to do.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.642
Now that we got
ourselves an easy target,

14:21.315 --> 14:23.427
time to bring on the pain.

14:24.203 --> 14:25.879
Lots of pain!

14:26.322 --> 14:30.135
Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.558
Let's crush this flatliner!

14:35.790 --> 14:37.709
Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!

14:49.545 --> 14:51.295
Yeah! All right!

15:00.617 --> 15:03.023
Let's toss 'em in the proton drive.

15:03.048 --> 15:06.410
It'll make a great light show
when they vaporize.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.175
Wait. Stop!

15:13.201 --> 15:14.872
Step away, Tana.

15:14.897 --> 15:17.083
We just want a little entertainment.

15:17.108 --> 15:19.583
No, Jukka. This isn't right.

15:24.972 --> 15:26.561
I'll let you go,

15:26.857 --> 15:29.511
if you swear to leave me alone.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.642
You cannot demand promises
under threat.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.023
I have responsibilities,
as do you to your people.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.611
Even these people.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.003
Oh, no.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.627
How did they find us?

15:52.031 --> 15:54.427
We tracked your pods and
gave the Commish a heads-up.

15:54.452 --> 15:55.588
You're welcome.

15:55.613 --> 15:57.780
<i>Attention, disorderly rabble.</i>

15:57.805 --> 16:02.486
<i>Return Princess Tana immediately,
or face the consequences.</i>

16:02.511 --> 16:04.760
You're not the boss of us, old man!

16:04.787 --> 16:06.558
Empathetics rule!

16:10.319 --> 16:11.692
<i>Ready weapons.</i>

16:11.717 --> 16:13.949
<i>Telekinetic cannons online.</i>

16:14.141 --> 16:16.459
Father, don't do this!

16:16.871 --> 16:18.822
I will not harm them, daughter,

16:18.847 --> 16:21.568
if you agree to come along peacefully

16:22.030 --> 16:24.448
<i>and return home for your Centering.</i>

16:25.313 --> 16:26.943
Don't listen to him, Tana!

16:26.975 --> 16:28.490
You know what they'll do to you!

16:28.515 --> 16:30.896
Yes. They will help you
control your powers.

16:30.921 --> 16:32.364
Don't you get it, man?

16:32.389 --> 16:37.358
The Centering helps Rigellians control
their powers by stripping them of emotions.

16:37.421 --> 16:42.249
She'll never feel anger,
or joy, or fear, or love.

16:44.727 --> 16:46.964
I am Groot?

16:46.989 --> 16:50.143
Eh, probably just rebel propaganda.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.951
<i>Uh, excuse me, Your Grand
Commissioner-ness,</i>

16:52.976 --> 16:55.861
<i>but, like, is that really
what the Centering does?</i>

16:56.267 --> 16:59.798
Telekinetic powers require
great discipline and judgment.

16:59.823 --> 17:02.079
Emotions interfere with that.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.277
<i>And a princess rejecting our ways</i>

17:04.301 --> 17:07.570
<i>poses a threat to the
stability of our society.</i>

17:07.596 --> 17:11.045
That's what you meant when you said
we couldn't take your feelings.

17:12.540 --> 17:15.462
This is no different from
what Thanos did to me,

17:15.506 --> 17:19.371
wiping my family from my memories so
I could serve him without question.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.714
I can't let that happen to anyone else.

17:21.896 --> 17:23.723
Even a spoiled brat.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.233
No.

17:27.259 --> 17:30.175
As Tana pointed out,
she is not my daughter.

17:30.521 --> 17:33.575
Her family has the right to do
what they feel is best for her.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.154
Family without emotion, without love,

17:37.179 --> 17:39.432
is nothing but imprisonment.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.854
<i>Look at those you stand with.</i>

17:42.068 --> 17:45.871
<i>Their unfiltered emotions
cause wanton destruction.</i>

17:47.642 --> 17:50.785
I am trying to ensure
my daughter's safety,

17:50.810 --> 17:52.959
and that of all my people.

17:52.979 --> 17:55.377
Is that not love?

17:55.656 --> 17:59.766
That said, if Tana will not
come of her own choosing,

17:59.791 --> 18:03.831
<i>then I will have no choice
but to take her by force.</i>

18:07.449 --> 18:08.336
Tana!

18:10.254 --> 18:12.413
Force this, bubble-heads!

18:12.438 --> 18:14.512
Fire up the proton drive!

18:33.543 --> 18:34.892
Here's an idea, Quill.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.739
Why don't ya steer us
out of the line of fire?

18:42.636 --> 18:43.295
Look!

18:43.320 --> 18:45.253
<i>Order will be maintained.</i>

18:45.278 --> 18:47.212
<i>Neutralize the rebels.</i>

18:57.100 --> 19:00.046
Drax, what would you want for Camaria?

19:00.475 --> 19:03.561
Wouldn't you want her to be
able to make her own choices?

19:08.227 --> 19:09.977
Help me!

19:11.546 --> 19:13.129
You may not be my daughter,

19:13.154 --> 19:15.115
but I will protect you as if you were.

19:18.732 --> 19:20.754
No harm will come to you, Tana,

19:20.779 --> 19:22.966
so swears Drax the Destroyer.

19:27.286 --> 19:28.586
What is that?

19:32.134 --> 19:34.158
Yes! It's my birthday!

19:34.183 --> 19:35.872
It is indeed.

19:35.897 --> 19:37.467
Release them.

19:39.694 --> 19:43.735
<i>Tana, I now
recognize you as a legal adult.</i>

19:43.760 --> 19:46.312
<i>And though I believe you
have made a grave error,</i>

19:46.337 --> 19:48.644
<i>you are free to decide your fate.</i>

19:48.948 --> 19:51.568
I hope you will do so wisely.

19:58.311 --> 19:59.287
So...

20:00.064 --> 20:02.591
Uh, no revolution?

20:02.933 --> 20:04.588
Apparently not today.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.056
Okay.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.510
Well, at least, we got
the princess on our side.

20:09.806 --> 20:12.089
That's a win! Whoo!

20:17.720 --> 20:21.246
Actually, I think I need to go
back to Rigel-3.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.307
You were right, Drax.

20:23.332 --> 20:25.640
I have a responsibility to my people.

20:26.465 --> 20:28.106
All of my people.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.281
And while it is true
that young Rigellians

20:34.306 --> 20:37.073
must learn discipline
and self-control,

20:37.522 --> 20:40.686
<i>it is also true that emotions
and feelings have value</i>

20:40.721 --> 20:45.292
<i>in shaping a just society
with empathy and compassion.</i>

20:45.317 --> 20:48.106
<i>We will find a way together.</i>

20:48.600 --> 20:51.797
I could not be more pleased
if she were truly my own daughter.

20:51.822 --> 20:55.610
I could, if we truly got
the units we're owed.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.297
Yeah, about that.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.183
Uh, since we technically missed the
deadline to deliver the princess,

21:00.208 --> 21:02.422
we're not, you know,
actually getting paid.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.527
I am Groot!

21:05.552 --> 21:07.513
But we did get a package.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.742
It is from Tana.

21:10.981 --> 21:12.436
"Dear Mr. Destroyer,"

21:12.461 --> 21:14.737
"thank you for taking
an interest in my well-being."

21:14.762 --> 21:17.450
"I know that any girl
would be proud and lucky"

21:17.654 --> 21:21.153
"to have you as a father."

21:21.243 --> 21:23.868
Ha! She is an excellent diplomat.

21:27.605 --> 21:29.285
And a fine seamstress.
