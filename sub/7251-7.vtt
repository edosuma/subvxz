WEBVTT

00:08.619 --> 00:10.522
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:11.326 --> 00:13.763
Hey, would you be horrified if I started clipping coupons again?

00:14.227 --> 00:16.697
- Yes.
- Oh, well, then, I won't.

00:16.954 --> 00:19.329
- Wait, did you say again?
- I meant ever.

00:19.416 --> 00:22.007
- When did you clip coupons before?
- I didn't. I misspoke. Whoops.

00:22.879 --> 00:27.880
Hey, how is it that your dirty laundry has increased exponentially since you started Yale?

00:27.951 --> 00:29.713
'Cause I'm a dirty, filthy Yale girl now.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.852
- I told you I'm not gonna clip them!
- Then I don't see the problem.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.689
Just for the Fig Newtons, please!

00:35.324 --> 00:37.588
- Whoa! That is...
- Sucks.

00:37.659 --> 00:39.620
That is totally sucks.

00:39.717 --> 00:42.052
And they're like on their two hundredth guitarist audition.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.673
Well, they must be down to the deaf, dumb, and blind ones.

00:46.788 --> 00:48.944
- Ah, he found it.
- Found what?

00:49.005 --> 00:50.428
The lost chord.

00:52.231 --> 00:53.403
So, the washer's broken.

00:53.501 --> 00:57.612
You didn't mention that when you saw me walk out with my exponential amounts of laundry.

00:57.677 --> 00:58.457
Sorry.

00:58.693 --> 01:01.790
Or when I called from Yale to say that I had exponential amounts of laundry to do.

01:01.908 --> 01:03.460
You've totally co-opted my word.

01:03.531 --> 01:07.535
Okay, plethora - that's my word. I have a plethora of dirty laundry and nowhere to do it.

01:07.601 --> 01:11.231
But you don't come home to do your laundry. You come home to see your mama.

01:11.319 --> 01:13.356
No, this time I came home to do my laundry.

01:13.714 --> 01:15.768
All right. I'll call the repairman A.S.A.P.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.339
- Hey, you hear that?
- What?

01:17.422 --> 01:19.588
- No music.
- And the band stopped playing, too.

01:20.361 --> 01:22.177
- Hi, Lane.
- How's it going there?

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.786 --> 01:38.398
You think she can hear us?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.542
I think out of self-defense her ears have become vestigial organs.

01:42.074 --> 01:44.461
- I'm not clipping coupons!
- Then I don't see the problem.

02:43.218 --> 02:46.358
- Hey, it's your friendly neighborhood Lorelai.
- I'm in the kitchen!

02:46.684 --> 02:48.179
- Good morning.
- Is it?

02:48.738 --> 02:51.436
Just spreading that love and sunshine around, huh, buddy?

02:51.574 --> 02:55.210
Lorelai, this is Beau, Jackson's brother. Beau, this is our friend Lorelai.

02:56.820 --> 02:59.413
Come on. Let's leave Oscar Wilde here to his reading.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.327
- What's with the 'tude?
- Jackson asked Beau to be here for the birth.

03:02.408 --> 03:04.696
Which was supposed to happen a week ago.

03:05.182 --> 03:09.043
So Beau's missing way more work than he thought he would, and he's letting me know it.

03:09.158 --> 03:11.379
Yeah, it would be nice if God gave us women a pop-up thing

03:11.444 --> 03:14.681
when a baby's done like on a turkey, but he chose not to. Hey, Jackson.

03:14.743 --> 03:17.866
Hi. This extra time is great, huh? I'm getting so much done.

03:18.055 --> 03:20.497
I know. I'm still storing meals. I've got two weeks worth.

03:20.589 --> 03:22.391
- Hey, Jackson?
- {111}{000}Yeah, Beau?

03:22.479 --> 03:24.757
- What day is it today?
- It's Saturday, Beau.

03:24.849 --> 03:26.628
I get time and a half on Saturdays.

03:27.015 --> 03:30.211
It gets me my fun things. Otherwise, it's all just bill paying.

03:30.288 --> 03:33.297
- Have I apologized to you enough?
- Yes, Daddy, you have.

03:33.405 --> 03:35.771
So, I got the plastic sheet on the bed. It fits perfectly.

03:35.863 --> 03:37.234
- Excellent.
- What's that for?

03:37.322 --> 03:38.606
- She doesn't know?
- Know about what?

03:38.693 --> 03:40.864
You ready? This is big. It's really good,

03:40.947 --> 03:43.174
and I want you to slowly drink it in. No big gulps.

03:43.251 --> 03:44.291
I'm ready to take a sip.

03:44.388 --> 03:46.404
We're skipping the hospital and having the baby here.

03:46.584 --> 03:48.458
- Here in your house?
- In our bed.

03:48.568 --> 03:50.506
- Hence the sheet.
- Got a honey of a sheet.

03:50.588 --> 03:55.046
It's the top of the line. The little thing will come out and carom right down into the catcher's arms.

03:55.140 --> 03:56.911
While we all yell, "hey, batter, batter, batter"?

03:57.024 --> 03:59.885
He means the midwife. Got the best one on the eastern seaboard.

04:00.105 --> 04:02.564
- You look mystified.
- No, it's just...

04:02.835 --> 04:04.863
you guys have done a lot of research on this, right?

04:05.051 --> 04:07.012
Millions of babies have been born this way.

04:07.171 --> 04:08.487
It's a great tradition.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.576
And hospitals are so cold, you know, so full of infections.

04:11.713 --> 04:14.943
- And dead people.
- And sometimes the dead people have infections.

04:15.062 --> 04:17.548
- And if they're not dead yet, they die.
- All true.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.182
But the best thing about having little Davey or Colgate here...

04:20.303 --> 04:22.587
zero chance of bringing home the wrong baby.

04:22.711 --> 04:26.208
What comes out of her here, stays here. Oh, I got something for you.

04:26.796 --> 04:29.818
It's a baby pager. It'll go off when Sookie's close.

04:30.344 --> 04:34.097
- Oh, cute.
- Scott Joplin seemed appropriately sunny.

04:34.215 --> 04:36.526
I want you to be here even if home birth disgusts you.

04:36.622 --> 04:38.819
Of course I'll be here. Nothing could keep me away.

04:39.003 --> 04:41.968
Extra buckets - I gotta put it on the list.

04:42.105 --> 04:44.605
Extra buckets? What's that... Never mind.

04:47.937 --> 04:50.778
Excuse me. Can my girlfriend and I sit here? This is my girlfriend.

04:51.837 --> 04:54.978
- My girlfriend and I appreciate it.
- Yes, thank you.

04:55.214 --> 04:56.687
I got a pretty polite girlfriend.

04:57.148 --> 04:59.570
- Should we be nervous about this?
- I don't know.

04:59.682 --> 05:02.156
Did Taylor tell anyone why he called an emergency meeting?

05:02.280 --> 05:04.219
He said nothing to me or my girlfriend.

05:04.398 --> 05:07.680
I can't remember the last town emergency meeting he called.

05:07.819 --> 05:10.086
- Me and my girlfriend can't either.
- Home birth?

05:10.191 --> 05:12.309
I was horrified and I hid it horribly.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.064
I wanted to be supportive but throw up at the same time.

05:15.201 --> 05:17.311
- A plastic sheet?
- I saw it.

05:17.444 --> 05:21.934
It was the same one that boy who couldn't hold it had to use in that after-school special.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.305
- What was that called?
- "It's Not Benny's Fault."

05:24.407 --> 05:27.157
Oh, God. It was so insane. It's what hospitals are for.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.674
- Hey, Lane, there's a seat behind my girlfriend.
- That's okay, Kirk.

05:33.712 --> 05:38.518
Get this. I just found the most amazing guitarist - a phenom.

05:38.627 --> 05:41.078
He was cool on the phone, and we're meeting him tomorrow.

05:41.181 --> 05:43.423
- That's great.
- I'm trying not to get my hopes up,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.605
but I've already figured out that our Spin cover

05:45.697 --> 05:49.199
should be against a bloodred backdrop with a skull hovering over us.

05:49.305 --> 05:53.086
- Oh, well, very Norman Rockwell.
- That woman's staring at me.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.973
Oh, Mrs. Van-uppity? Well, maybe you're just her type.

05:56.209 --> 06:00.222
People, thank you for assembling on such short notice.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.948
What's up, Taylor?

06:02.071 --> 06:03.805
My girlfriend was wondering that, too.

06:04.108 --> 06:08.353
As you know, every year, one lucky town in Connecticut

06:08.446 --> 06:11.306
gets to host "The Festival of Living Pictures,"

06:11.393 --> 06:17.073
a show which presents onstage recreations of famous works of art,

06:17.154 --> 06:23.441
statues, paintings, et cetera, with real people posing as the figures in the art.

06:23.566 --> 06:27.369
We hosted it seven years ago - successfully, I might add.

06:27.486 --> 06:29.320
- Yeah, it was a blast.
- Definitely.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.117
My girlfriend's gonna love this.

06:31.231 --> 06:34.240
The town of Woodbury was supposed to host it this year,

06:34.332 --> 06:38.075
but because of recent flooding, they canceled at the last minute,

06:38.224 --> 06:43.748
and I offered Stars Hollow to be the host. How does that sound?

06:44.055 --> 06:46.104
- Cool.
- Yeah, sign us up.

06:46.236 --> 06:48.659
Yeah, Taylor, you finally did something right.

06:50.287 --> 06:52.524
- Your beard is so sexy.
- How much time do we have?

06:52.769 --> 06:58.642
One week. And as per tradition, we need to come up with one original recreation

06:58.741 --> 07:01.519
to go with all the others that are in the show every year.

07:01.653 --> 07:04.480
- Well, that's not a lot of time.
- Yeah, Taylor, is it even possible?

07:04.586 --> 07:06.486
Well, it'll have to be.

07:06.625 --> 07:10.433
I've already assured Hank, who is the Taylor Doose of Woodbury,

07:10.542 --> 07:16.399
that we'd take it over successfully. It's a challenge, people, but doable.

07:16.608 --> 07:20.397
Now, I would like to introduce you to a key player

07:20.501 --> 07:23.106
in our execution of this endeavor,

07:23.217 --> 07:27.684
the head of the Connecticut Arts Council, Buff Otis.

07:29.122 --> 07:31.477
- Hey, it's your future wife.
- Shut up.

07:31.594 --> 07:33.239
Would you like to say a few words, Mrs. Otis?

07:34.319 --> 07:38.564
Your enthusiasm... shocks me.

07:40.303 --> 07:42.573
- Is that good?
- Hard to tell.

07:42.673 --> 07:44.420
- It might be.
- Scary broad.

07:44.559 --> 07:47.476
I will be managing the event and emceeing.

07:47.575 --> 07:50.338
Miss Patty, you will be stage-managing.

07:50.549 --> 07:53.438
Lorelai, if you could help organize the costumes?

07:53.548 --> 07:56.207
I'm here for you and your sexy beard, Taylor.

07:57.215 --> 08:01.834
Everyone should sign up now if you want to be considered to be cast in one of the recreations.

08:01.926 --> 08:04.322
Mrs. Otis and I will make the final decisions.

08:04.843 --> 08:08.224
Hey, you're gonna be the girl in that Renoir painting again, right?

08:08.337 --> 08:09.862
You were such a doll in that.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.625
Oh, I'm sure I can be persuaded.

08:11.937 --> 08:14.517
This is an enormous challenge, people,

08:14.620 --> 08:19.605
but I say we do it and do it well. Meeting adjourned.

08:21.858 --> 08:23.359
- Wait.
- Why?

08:23.482 --> 08:24.787
I want to see if she asks you out.

08:25.795 --> 08:29.058
I wonder if I want to be something other than the Renoir girl.

08:29.181 --> 08:32.356
I'm sorry, the audience has come to expect you in the role of Renoir girl.

08:32.442 --> 08:34.162
You can't disappoint them. It's a plum role.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.236
True, true.

08:35.412 --> 08:38.955
Sorry I took so long. I was dealing with more divorce-lawyer stuff.

08:39.037 --> 08:41.486
Good Lord, is Nicole's lawyer still harassing you?

08:41.591 --> 08:46.287
No, mine was. And please don't point out the irony of my paying a lawyer to work for me.

08:46.383 --> 08:49.508
Okay, but then you're gonna owe me something else I can ironically comment on.

08:49.621 --> 08:52.005
Fine. Hey, what was that emergency meeting all about?

08:52.098 --> 08:54.065
We're hosting "The Festival of Living Pictures" again.

08:54.176 --> 08:57.545
- Oh, joy.
- His lack of enthusiasm shocks me.

08:57.658 --> 09:00.209
You're involving yourself in this thing? It's such a stupid waste of time.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.216
I just thought of the perfect painting for Luke to be in. "Cranky Guy in Baseball Cap."

09:04.289 --> 09:05.676
Was that Manet or Monet?

09:05.773 --> 09:07.877
That was mustard on my hamburger and a side of fries, please.

09:07.934 --> 09:10.258
- She's the queen of segues.
- She's the queen of something.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.718
- You want your usual?
- Yes, please.

09:13.239 --> 09:16.464
Maybe I'll just be a backstage person this year. There's less pressure.

09:16.537 --> 09:17.949
You don't have to get made up, and...

09:18.779 --> 09:22.399
- What are they doing?
- Well, I bet she's coming to...

09:22.486 --> 09:25.343
Hey, and no more inappropriate lesbian references, please.

09:25.424 --> 09:26.331
All right.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.488
Oh, you know what? I bet you're in line for the new painting they're cooking up.

09:30.877 --> 09:32.203
I feel like a used car.

09:33.514 --> 09:35.189
- Turn to the side.
- What?

09:35.347 --> 09:37.815
Turn to the side. We need to see your profile.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.595
- Just what I thought.
- This is a violation of my civil rights.

09:40.692 --> 09:43.324
You better do what John Ashcroft says or they may just follow us home.

09:43.447 --> 09:44.650
Unbelievable.

09:46.862 --> 09:50.160
Other way. Other way.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.290
I'm a Yale student, for God's sake.

09:53.119 --> 09:54.275
Thank you.

09:56.150 --> 09:58.135
- Crazy, doofus town.
- Yeah.

10:00.978 --> 10:04.767
Let's not loiter around the cast sheets, people. Find your name and then move on.

10:04.869 --> 10:06.825
Oh, cool. I'm gonna be some statue.

10:07.219 --> 10:09.323
You're "The Reaper," Andrew...

10:09.411 --> 10:13.302
a prize work at Versailles and a prize role, not some statue.

10:13.727 --> 10:15.580
So I get to be painted all white, huh?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.089
Yes, that's what that means.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.665
Hi, Taylor. When are the costumes getting here?

10:20.982 --> 10:23.235
Hank in Woodbury swears they're en route,

10:23.327 --> 10:25.887
but you gotta double and triple-check with that guy.

10:26.076 --> 10:27.403
Hank's the you in Woodbury.

10:27.535 --> 10:30.997
A real ninny. He's praying we don't pull this off,

10:31.063 --> 10:34.243
- but that only inspires me to work harder.
- I need to see the list.

10:35.032 --> 10:38.726
- Watch the elbows, Kirk.
- I just need to see the list.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.499
He's going to be very happy.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.206
- What'd you get, Kirk?
- Christ in "The Last Supper."

10:44.324 --> 10:46.504
- The big kahuna.
- I'm gonna do it right, too.

10:46.586 --> 10:49.942
- Lots of research. What's a good book to read?
- The bible?

10:50.058 --> 10:52.761
Right. Yo, where are my apostles? Where are my homeboys?

10:52.937 --> 10:55.542
- James, son of Alpheus, give me five.
- All right.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.917
Simon, the Canaanite, don't leave me hanging.

10:58.404 --> 11:01.097
- I say we go celebrate. How 'bout Shakey's?
- All right.

11:01.609 --> 11:04.968
- That is one happy Christ.
- Well, it was nice of you guys to give him that.

11:05.106 --> 11:08.025
Oh, I wanted to show you this. It's our original picture.

11:08.137 --> 11:14.497
We think Rory would be perfect for it. It's called "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."

11:14.609 --> 11:17.308
- Wow, that's Rory.
- Do you think she'll do it?

11:17.415 --> 11:20.395
- Well, you got some sway with me.
- Good, good.

11:20.651 --> 11:23.128
- Okay, I'm confused.
- I should go make my calls.

11:23.257 --> 11:28.730
- I'm not the... Renoir girl.
- Oh, really? I didn't realize that...

11:28.817 --> 11:30.953
Patty, I'm the spitting image of the Renoir girl.

11:31.070 --> 11:34.936
I played her seven years ago and received the proper accolades. This is a mistake.

11:35.059 --> 11:35.852
Maybe.

11:36.743 --> 11:38.735
- Taylor?
- Yes, Lorelai?

11:38.877 --> 11:42.421
I'm not listed as the Renoir girl. Is that a mistake?

11:42.621 --> 11:45.857
- Frankly, no, it's not.
- Okay, I'm not listed as anything else, either.

11:45.990 --> 11:48.372
That's also correct. You'll be helping with costumes.

11:48.479 --> 11:50.824
I don't get it. Why am I not the Renoir girl? I'm the spitting image.

11:50.941 --> 11:52.621
You are. Your look is perfect.

11:52.723 --> 11:54.193
Then why am I not the Renoir girl?

11:54.313 --> 11:56.236
- I really have to tell you why?
- Yes, you do.

11:56.389 --> 11:58.381
- You flinched.
- I what?

11:58.503 --> 12:00.311
Seven years ago, the curtain opened.

12:00.434 --> 12:04.244
You were posed in the painting, then you flinched noticeably.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.029
- I did not flinch.
- We thought you were having an attack.

12:07.203 --> 12:10.792
- I did not flinch!
- You almost knocked Terrence over.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.516
- I did not!
- The whole town saw it.

12:13.623 --> 12:18.298
And with Hank from Woodbury looking over my shoulder, I'm not taking any risks.

12:18.380 --> 12:22.041
- Patty, please, back me up here.
- Honey, I'm sorry, you flinched!

12:22.148 --> 12:24.468
- Big-time.
- You almost knocked Terrence over.

12:24.548 --> 12:27.012
Yeah, you screwed the pooch, so you're out. I'm sorry.

12:27.467 --> 12:30.198
So, you'll ask Rory about the painting?

12:33.741 --> 12:37.677
- It's humiliating!
- You and the Renoir girl - it was a lock.

12:37.786 --> 12:39.463
Yeah, until this smear campaign.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.392
- There's a lot of tension in the air here.
- Well, it's midterms.

12:46.503 --> 12:48.798
- You seem calm.
- Well, on the outside.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.102
Is this what you're using, Dream Fresh laundry powder?

12:51.210 --> 12:53.186
- It's a new brand.
- It's an off-brand.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.153
It leaves your clothes with that Dream-Fresh scent.

12:55.434 --> 12:56.703
You used a coupon, didn't you?

12:56.812 --> 13:00.285
Thirty-five cents off or not, I still would have chosen Dream Fresh.

13:00.882 --> 13:03.758
- So, who'd they pick for the Renoir girl?
- Carol Dandridge.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.304
- Carol Dandridge?
- Carol Dandruff from now on!

13:06.432 --> 13:09.667
Okay, now, don't take it out on poor Carol. It's not like she lobbied for it.

13:09.759 --> 13:13.384
I bet she did. That would be just like that old porky, doody-dridge.

13:13.482 --> 13:15.536
Oh, wow. You're really bummed about this, aren't you?

13:15.658 --> 13:20.195
On the outside, I am a mature adult who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place,

13:20.260 --> 13:22.494
and on the inside, I just wanna wear that pretty dress again!

13:22.559 --> 13:24.807
- You will.
- Yeah, if a brick lands

13:24.879 --> 13:28.034
on Taylor's head and he suddenly likes me again. Oh, a brick.

13:28.135 --> 13:30.301
You don't need a brick. You have me. I'll take care of it.

13:30.373 --> 13:33.322
- What are you talking about?
- You are going to be the Renoir girl. End of story.

13:33.414 --> 13:35.360
How?
- Well, if they want an Anthea

13:35.426 --> 13:39.378
for "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea," then they're going to have to have you for the Renoir girl.

13:39.471 --> 13:43.078
Well, look at you folding your laundry all haughty and powerful.

13:43.183 --> 13:45.621
Bada-bing all over his nice ivy-league suit.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.001
Rory, you couldn't do that. Come on.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.875
It would be embarrassing, it would be manipulative, and can you do it tonight?

13:50.940 --> 13:54.238
I think I'll wait until the Anthea costume is perfectly fitted to my specifications.

13:54.312 --> 13:57.663
- Then we won't have no surprises.
- I am in awe.

13:57.735 --> 13:59.737
- Pass me the Dream Fresh?
- I wouldn't dare not to.

14:01.264 --> 14:03.858
I don't know about you, but I'm completely jazzed about this.

14:03.940 --> 14:07.019
This is the first time I've been excited about playing since Dave.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.259
If he's half as good as this tape, I'm gonna plotz.

14:10.761 --> 14:13.039
- Can we help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Lane.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.872
- I'm Lane.
- Am I late?

14:14.954 --> 14:16.408
- For?
- The audition.

14:16.509 --> 14:18.249
- For?
- I'm Gil!

14:21.867 --> 14:25.306
Gil. No, you're right on time. Come on in.

14:29.325 --> 14:30.960
Primo space.

14:31.855 --> 14:33.519
- Primo.
- How you guys doin'?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.998
- I'm Brian.
- Zach.

14:36.315 --> 14:38.894
- Where do you guys want me?
- Right there's good.

14:42.828 --> 14:44.830
How's your research coming along, Kirk?

14:44.920 --> 14:47.306
Good, although I got off to a slow start.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.541
I didn't realize Jesus wasn't in the Old Testament 'til I hit page 368.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.592
- Hey, Taylor.
- Hello.

14:54.931 --> 14:58.270
I took a quick survey of the costumes. Looks like everything's here and accounted for.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.450
- And the Renoir girl dress still fits you?
- Like a glove.

15:01.807 --> 15:05.162
So help me, if you make me look bad in front of Hank from Woodbury,

15:05.252 --> 15:06.912
there is gonna be hell to pay.

15:07.813 --> 15:08.754
Sorry.

15:09.389 --> 15:10.593
Hey, I'm here for a fitting.

15:10.748 --> 15:12.376
You've come to the right place. What are you in?

15:12.466 --> 15:15.969
- "The Last Supper."
- Oh, you must be one of my missing apostles.

15:16.051 --> 15:19.291
- Still haven't met them all. I'm Christ.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun, huh?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.985
- Definitely. Which apostle are you?
- Judas.

15:22.334 --> 15:25.308
- Judas.
- So, where do I go for my fitting?

15:25.415 --> 15:27.453
Oh, I think you know where you're going, pal.

15:27.613 --> 15:29.245
Right through that flap. I'll meet you back there.

15:29.332 --> 15:32.641
Thanks. So I heard you and all the apostles are going to Shakey's later.

15:32.752 --> 15:34.908
You heard wrong, friend. We're not going to Shakey's.

15:35.031 --> 15:37.130
Oh, okay. Maybe some other time.

15:37.243 --> 15:38.978
Yeah, some other time.

16:22.352 --> 16:26.832
- Man, you guys are fantastic!
- Yeah, you too.

16:26.919 --> 16:31.009
- Really good, Gil.
- I mean it's tight, you know. It feels right.

16:31.085 --> 16:33.128
- Definitely.
- It's got a feel that...

16:33.207 --> 16:35.238
- Feels right.
- You want to do another one?

16:35.319 --> 16:36.063
Sure.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.929
Just give me one minute to call work.

16:39.210 --> 16:43.977
I own a sandwich shop in Salisbury and I gotta check in every once in a while or it's chaos.

16:44.085 --> 16:47.336
I'll be right back. Awesome, guys! Really!

16:47.762 --> 16:48.729
Back at ya!

16:53.803 --> 16:56.302
He's... he's...

16:56.393 --> 16:59.102
Old. Just say it, dude. Grandpa's old.

16:59.190 --> 17:01.534
- He's not a grandpa.
- Did you know how old he was?

17:01.612 --> 17:05.492
- He sounded young on the phone.
- Right here, he's got some lines.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.169
- That blows my mind.
- What is he, late thirties?

17:08.271 --> 17:09.681
- Approaching forty.
- Forty?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.994
He was alive before man walked on the moon.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.598
Don't do that, man. You're freaking me out.

17:13.665 --> 17:17.935
Let's not be over-dramatic, guys. I mean, he is an incredible guitarist.

17:18.010 --> 17:21.529
- He's had a lot of time to practice.
- And the bicentennial - he was alive for that.

17:21.589 --> 17:24.202
This is the best we've sounded since Dave, and he's really...

17:24.262 --> 17:25.792
- Elderly.
- Excited.

17:25.946 --> 17:29.577
- He was our age when we were born.
- He thinks we're great

17:29.648 --> 17:32.495
- There were no cd's when he was born.
- Stop it, man. I mean it.

17:32.577 --> 17:34.369
Maybe there's a way to offset his oldness.

17:34.466 --> 17:38.142
Put a hat on him. Dress him up like Angus Young in AC/DC - that schoolboy outfit.

17:38.214 --> 17:40.325
He could have seen AC/DC with their original lead singer.

17:40.398 --> 17:43.996
And 1980 is when that guy choked on his own vomit. That's old.

17:44.072 --> 17:45.971
- You want to stop the audition?
- We shouldn't be rude.

17:46.053 --> 17:47.784
- Good.
- Fine, we'll keep going,

17:47.867 --> 17:50.902
but remember, any new member has to be approved by all of us.

17:50.963 --> 17:53.278
- So one vote against, and he's back at bingo.
- I know.

17:53.549 --> 17:57.901
Cindy knows where the extra prosciutto is, Kevin. Ask her.

17:57.988 --> 18:02.350
Come on, I've told you before, when I'm not there, Cindy is me, okay?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.557
I'll check in later. Bye.

18:06.135 --> 18:09.401
Kids, man. In one ear and out the other.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.425
Come on. Let's rock!

18:15.997 --> 18:20.163
Ooh, balloons! Sad, little, droopy balloons.

18:20.926 --> 18:23.952
- We got 'em too soon.
- Oh. Hey, you feeling okay?

18:24.085 --> 18:26.732
Fine. Bruce just suggested a little afternoon rest.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.231
- Bruce? Who's he?
- She.

18:28.325 --> 18:29.866
- It's a last name.
- Who's she?

18:29.952 --> 18:31.867
Best midwife on the eastern seaboard.

18:32.687 --> 18:36.071
So it's gonna be another fifty bucks to change the flight again?

18:36.246 --> 18:39.938
That's six and a half hours take-home after taxes, disability, and FICA.

18:39.999 --> 18:42.994
And the Oscar for biggest blubber baby goes to...

18:43.294 --> 18:47.120
No, no, go ahead. Put me down for it. I got no choice.

18:48.766 --> 18:50.326
She sounded hot.

18:50.416 --> 18:54.017
Hey, Beau, why don't you go take a little walk? You know, go do something.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.062
Yeah, good idea.

18:56.151 --> 18:59.527
But there's nothing to do in this hick town, not like back in Bogalusa.

18:59.613 --> 19:02.153
Hey, Beau, why don't you come help me pick the zucchini in the back?

19:02.229 --> 19:07.165
I got a couple of giant Miracle Gro ones out there. Huh? It'll tickle you.

19:07.257 --> 19:08.451
That might be something.

19:08.994 --> 19:12.739
- Wow, you can cut the sexual tension with a knife.
- Don't joke.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.280
The bedroom is now prepared for the baby.

19:15.372 --> 19:17.718
Your husband tried, but he screwed up, so I fixed it.

19:17.821 --> 19:19.294
Thank you, Bruce.

19:19.607 --> 19:23.539
- There's someone new here.
- Bruce, this is my best friend I was telling you about, Lorelai.

19:25.022 --> 19:30.006
I heard you were the best midwife on the eastern seaboard. May I call you Bruce?

19:30.078 --> 19:31.808
- Everyone does.
- Then I will call you Bruce.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.862
- You're anti-midwife.
- Pardon me?

19:33.943 --> 19:37.358
There's anti-midwife energy in this room and it wasn't here when I left it.

19:37.466 --> 19:41.403
- Well, it's not coming from me.
- Yeah, Bruce, Lorelai is pro-you, all the way.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.389
I'll be in the bedroom.

19:46.242 --> 19:49.656
Wow, that woman's got strong hands.

19:49.769 --> 19:51.988
She ate a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter in one sitting.

19:52.068 --> 19:54.557
I would want a woman just like that yanking the baby out of me.

19:54.649 --> 19:57.750
- Please lay on your side, Sookie.
- Yeah, sorry.

19:58.162 --> 20:01.530
This is the position I'm going to be in for the baby. She wants me to get used to it.

20:01.607 --> 20:04.540
- Less tearing this way.
- Oh, smack that image right out of my head.

20:04.613 --> 20:07.750
- I beg your pardon?
- Hey, you know, Bruce spent two years

20:07.801 --> 20:10.454
in China educating poor villagers on female issues.

20:10.531 --> 20:12.374
Oh, I hear they got great Chinese food there.

20:13.897 --> 20:15.037
A card.

20:15.164 --> 20:17.274
You're the friend who's going to be there, right?

20:17.371 --> 20:20.751
- With rings on my fingers and bells on my toes.
- You'll leave the negativity at home?

20:20.832 --> 20:23.607
Bruce, I swear, I am Miss Positivity.

20:23.715 --> 20:28.513
I swear, I am not anti-midwife. I mean, that would be as dumb as being,

20:28.589 --> 20:30.413
I don't know, anti-best friend. Don't you think?

20:30.515 --> 20:34.934
- You're the one who asked me out to pick zucchinis.
- Right. Pick them, not kick them.

20:35.015 --> 20:38.405
- You used to be fun. Now you're just a big-city phony.
- Beau!

20:38.497 --> 20:41.333
- What did I say before?
- I wasn't listening.

20:41.425 --> 20:45.394
The baby will come when the baby comes. We're all here to serve the baby. Jackson!

20:45.486 --> 20:47.262
- What?
- How are you serving the baby?

20:47.549 --> 20:49.608
- I could go get more balloons?
- Good.

20:49.709 --> 20:53.279
- And, Beau, how are you serving the baby?
- I could help Jackson with balloons.

20:53.381 --> 20:56.073
- You need two men for that?
- I could get... flowers.

20:56.151 --> 20:56.985
Good!

20:59.165 --> 21:02.395
Okay, we're going to get balloons and flowers.

21:06.129 --> 21:07.788
She didn't give me any instructions.

21:07.981 --> 21:10.374
- Should I move?
- I wouldn't yet.

21:15.079 --> 21:17.179
- This is nice.
- It is a beautiful day.

21:17.311 --> 21:19.939
- Good suggestion.
- You think Bruce was just trying to get rid of us?

21:20.055 --> 21:23.333
You, yes. But Bruce is there for the baby, and I've got the baby.

21:23.512 --> 21:25.381
- Have you checked that recently?
- What?

21:25.489 --> 21:29.441
Are you sure she hasn't taken the baby and shoved a pillow under there when you weren't looking?

21:29.507 --> 21:31.065
- Oh my God!
- What?

21:31.177 --> 21:33.260
- You haven't popped yet.
- Not yet.

21:33.414 --> 21:35.211
It's like an elephant's gestation.

21:35.519 --> 21:38.448
Thanks for the very welcome perspective on that, Andrew.

21:39.788 --> 21:41.572
Hey, how's the research going, Kirk?

21:41.678 --> 21:46.558
Good. I'm using the clothing to get into character and I've been focusing on historical foods.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.871
- Christ ate a lot of lentils.
- No utensils back then?

21:50.015 --> 21:55.201
- No, they had utensils.
- This is a disaster, an unmitigated disaster!

21:55.287 --> 21:58.794
- What happened?
- We're missing half the table for "The Last Supper."

21:58.861 --> 22:01.699
- Drag.
- This is Hank from Woodbury's doing.

22:01.780 --> 22:06.010
- That little fink only shipped half the table on purpose.
- No, I just talked to him, Taylor,

22:06.112 --> 22:10.580
- and he swears he shipped everything they had.
- Let's think here. There's gotta be a way to do this.

22:10.633 --> 22:15.301
Just add a card table to the end or some TV trays. It'll be like a funky Last Supper.

22:15.363 --> 22:17.595
"The Last Supper" cannot be funky.

22:17.708 --> 22:21.359
Or we could just make do with what we have and crowd all the apostles around it.

22:21.447 --> 22:24.594
- Or eliminate some of the apostles.
- This is not going to work.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.434
- I think we're just gonna have to throw in the towel.
- I think you might be right, Taylor.

22:28.496 --> 22:31.942
- This just might be a sign to pack it in.
- So no festival?

22:32.108 --> 22:34.809
- No festival.
- I have to keep moving.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.089
- Okay, start packing it up, people.
- You would fold?

22:39.392 --> 22:40.472
What was that, Kirk?

22:41.121 --> 22:44.235
You would fold due simply to hardship?

22:44.369 --> 22:47.938
Not now, Kirk. Keep everything where it is, guys.

22:48.024 --> 22:49.468
No reason to unload it just to load it again.

22:49.621 --> 22:52.979
Would you follow blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel?

22:53.098 --> 22:56.046
Oh, that's your blood sugar talking, sweetie. Eat a candy bar.

22:56.128 --> 22:59.120
- This is but a crisis of faith.
- I said not now, Kirk.

22:59.201 --> 23:01.946
- Let him talk. What's the harm?
- When the road to your destination

23:02.021 --> 23:06.026
is revealed to be long and dusty, is your destination's value so diminished?

23:06.686 --> 23:11.049
- Well, I suppose not, but still...
- If a storm mars your camp for the night,

23:11.101 --> 23:15.600
is it wise to search for high ground or hold your camp 'til the light of new day?

23:16.118 --> 23:18.729
Well, it's something to think about.

23:18.827 --> 23:22.524
A crisis of faith can be delivered, but one must believe to be delivered.

23:22.624 --> 23:25.810
No way am I building that table out for them, no way.

23:25.897 --> 23:28.733
- Anyone ask you to, Jose?
- Nope, but they're going to.

23:28.816 --> 23:32.892
- They'll just get Tom to do it.
- The contractor? No, he's too busy with his own stuff.

23:33.450 --> 23:34.602
- You having twins?
- No.

23:34.688 --> 23:38.016
- You sure?
- Let me think about it for another millisecond - no!

23:38.087 --> 23:40.954
- It looks like you're having twins.
- You're gonna make me fall in love with you, Luke.

23:41.006 --> 23:43.086
- It would take me hours.
- What would?

23:43.142 --> 23:46.895
The table. It's gotta be built out in forced perspective. It's complicated.

23:46.961 --> 23:49.045
Throw a stick and you can find someone to fix that table.

23:49.118 --> 23:51.426
So grab a stick and throw it because I'm not doing it.

23:51.508 --> 23:53.900
- No one asked you to.
- Not yet.

23:56.561 --> 24:00.613
- I'm hungry. Let's get something.
- Whoa, check out the group.

24:02.183 --> 24:05.516
- There might be loaves and fishes.
- I had fish last night.

24:06.745 --> 24:10.851
Do not heed the naysayers. They will not lead you down the proper road.

24:11.097 --> 24:14.323
Hey, Rory. Dig the sounds coming from that garage.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.606
- They sound amazing.
- I was over there before.

24:16.693 --> 24:20.806
- That new guitarist - yum yum, like a long-haired cake.
- Sounds like a winner.

24:20.889 --> 24:23.006
- You gonna check him out?
- Yeah, Lane called and asked me to come down

24:23.108 --> 24:27.105
- and drink in the whole picture.
- I got dibs on the new hunk. Rrrr!

24:58.802 --> 25:01.000
Really tight, guys, but it's getting late. I gotta go.

25:01.100 --> 25:05.850
- Go rest.
- Hey, Gil, this is my friend Rory. It's her house.

25:05.950 --> 25:07.801
- Hey, you guys sound great.
- Don't you think?

25:08.078 --> 25:11.904
- These guys are gonna be as good as Pink Floyd.
- Nice topical reference.

25:12.008 --> 25:14.852
- Lane, you got my number?
- Yeah, Gil, I've got your number.

25:14.949 --> 25:17.145
- Great. So, we'll talk later?
- We'll talk later.

25:17.402 --> 25:18.307
Take it easy.

25:19.230 --> 25:20.171
Bye.

25:22.910 --> 25:26.555
Okay, Zach, shut up for a minute. I want to hear what Rory has to say.

25:26.685 --> 25:29.992
I didn't tell her what she was walking into, so she's our fresh eyes here.

25:30.141 --> 25:32.199
- He's great.
- And...

25:32.368 --> 25:36.923
Experienced. And... Babette thinks he's really cute,

25:37.036 --> 25:41.026
so she's got dibs, and... he moves great. The jump was cool.

25:41.113 --> 25:43.924
- I was afraid he was gonna break a hip.
- Well, he's our only prospect.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.914
And maybe that schoolboy outfit's worth a shot.

25:46.013 --> 25:48.321
Look, you're all fooling yourselves here.

25:48.404 --> 25:52.515
Bottom line - dude rocks, but dude's too old. I vote "no."

25:52.756 --> 25:56.161
- Okay, I guess that's that, then.
- That's that.

25:56.278 --> 25:58.644
- And that could be that for the band.
- That could be that, too.

25:58.730 --> 25:59.586
Okay.

26:07.014 --> 26:09.227
- Identify yourself!
- It's me!

26:09.360 --> 26:10.931
- Who?
- Me!

26:11.086 --> 26:13.282
- Sookie?
- It's not coming out!

26:13.472 --> 26:15.058
My God, it's one in the morning.

26:15.417 --> 26:20.352
It's lodged in there! It's stuck, for God's sake! It's not coming out!

26:20.567 --> 26:23.235
- You're insane.
- And it's growing all the time,

26:23.343 --> 26:26.979
just getting bigger and bigger. I've forgotten what it's like not to be expanding.

26:27.095 --> 26:30.531
I'll get so huge, I'll be the fat guy in "Monty Python's Meaning of Life."

26:30.613 --> 26:33.911
I'll explode and slime the whole room. People could die.

26:34.034 --> 26:37.013
- Honey, sit down, wrap this around you.
- Ooh! That Andrew.

26:37.116 --> 26:39.850
- I hate that he was right, that pasty-faced bastard!
- Right about what?

26:39.938 --> 26:43.921
- Oh, no, I can't sit.
- Right about what?

26:44.119 --> 26:47.228
I looked up an elephant's gestation period - 22 months!

26:47.320 --> 26:49.368
- You're not an elephant.
- But Baby doesn't know that.

26:49.481 --> 26:52.537
- Why would Baby think you're an elephant?
- Because he's tiny and stupid

26:52.624 --> 26:57.120
and floating around in a sack of fluid. He doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground.

26:57.192 --> 27:00.796
- What happened?
- You know, an elephant squirted me once at the zoo.

27:00.858 --> 27:04.073
Maybe it shot something on me - some kind of elephant-gestation juice.

27:04.251 --> 27:06.915
Honey, I mean tonight. What happened? You were fine when I left you.

27:07.006 --> 27:10.596
- Where did the freak-out come from?
- Are you listening? It's not coming out!

27:10.739 --> 27:14.829
- The ship's too big and the bottle's too small!
- You have to sit down and rest.

27:14.938 --> 27:18.446
For two hours, I've been doing everything I can to make it come out.

27:18.532 --> 27:23.106
- I mean, I've jumped, jiggled, shimmied.
- Add a feather boa and I could book you on the burlesque circuit.

27:23.170 --> 27:26.008
- My pain is funny to you.
- No, but you should not be hopscotching

27:26.108 --> 27:28.403
all around town trying to get the baby out. That's not how it works.

27:28.470 --> 27:33.160
This is my mother's fault. She fed me too much roughage as a kid. Bran and granola and rapini.

27:33.216 --> 27:38.510
And now my insides are all rough and grabby, and Davey can't work his way out of my sandpaper innards.

27:38.587 --> 27:45.580
I want booze. I want a Manhattan and a scotch and a beer and a Rob Roy and a sidecar.

27:45.838 --> 27:50.451
But I can't, and I'm mad about that. I want to give birth!

27:50.521 --> 27:53.271
I would give you a hug if you would sit still for one second.

27:53.348 --> 27:55.657
- Yours came out. How'd you get yours out?
- I swallowed a map.

27:55.729 --> 28:00.787
Cut the freaking vagueness. Why is it you mothers don't want to pass down your wisdom to other mothers?

28:00.844 --> 28:02.927
- You're selfish.
- Please, stop jiggling.

28:02.995 --> 28:06.831
- Not 'til I'm skinny.
- All right, bouncy San Pedro, can I just show you something here?

28:06.961 --> 28:09.896
You can show me your sweet tokus as long as I can keep jiggling.

28:09.976 --> 28:13.748
Fine, keep jiggling. I was just going through something,

28:13.826 --> 28:16.527
I thought you might be interested. It's from 1984.

28:16.587 --> 28:18.908
- The book?
- No, the year.

28:19.040 --> 28:25.215
It's my baby box. It's full of all these little things, mementos and stuff from the night Rory was born.

28:25.282 --> 28:29.691
- I haven't taken it out in ages.
- Mine's not getting a box because mine's not coming out.

28:29.823 --> 28:34.851
My walkman with the homemade compilation tape still in it. "99 Luft Balloons,"

28:34.928 --> 28:37.181
- some R.E.M., some Thompson Twins.
- I never cared for them.

28:37.242 --> 28:40.181
The magazine I was reading that night,

28:40.279 --> 28:44.011
with a special feature on who's hotter - Andrew McCarthy or Emilio Estevez.

28:44.093 --> 28:48.997
- They're both dogs.
- My Bubblicious-gum necklace, my Chunky wrapper.

28:49.079 --> 28:52.859
Oh, I do like the Chunky's. I'd like bourbon better, but I do like the Chunky's.

28:52.935 --> 28:54.722
- John's digits.
- John who?

28:54.804 --> 28:56.847
He was volunteering at the hospital for high school credit.

28:56.930 --> 28:59.964
- He said, "Call me when you get your figure back."
- Sweet-talker.

29:00.919 --> 29:05.572
And for me, it was always Emilio 'cause he was kind of nasty.

29:05.663 --> 29:06.826
Same here.

29:08.050 --> 29:11.614
- Rory's first jumper.
- Bananarama?

29:11.860 --> 29:15.816
I made it out of one of my t-shirts. It was the first thing I ever made her - ever made, ever.

29:15.909 --> 29:18.690
It was post-Gilmore economy. Look how tiny.

29:19.284 --> 29:21.931
- Tiny.
- She was the most beautiful pink all over.

29:22.042 --> 29:28.275
She even smelled pink. That sounds weird. I can't describe it - that little, pink, baby smell.

29:28.820 --> 29:35.694
The first time her eyes focused on me and her little fingers reached out...

29:35.806 --> 29:38.826
I was someone new. She had me.

29:39.266 --> 29:41.909
- Emilio.
- Rory.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.647
We're five minutes away from the starting gate, people. Five minutes.

30:02.143 --> 30:05.804
Oh, my God, you guys look so cute. You know, it was just seven short years ago

30:05.875 --> 30:08.554
- that I was a little Chinese acrobat just like you.
- You smell!

30:09.055 --> 30:12.056
And we respected our elders when I was a little Chinese acrobat.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.547
- I hate kids.
- Lookin' good, lookin' good.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.497
Hey everybody, big night, huh?

30:18.641 --> 30:21.312
- Anyone sitting here?
- Yes. You have to go somewhere else.

30:21.395 --> 30:23.708
- But Miss Patty said I...
- You have to go somewhere else!

30:24.206 --> 30:29.729
Perhaps there's an empty chair next to one of your friends, say, the high priest Caiaphas?

30:29.825 --> 30:33.037
- Maybe he can accommodate you, hm?
- I guess so.

30:33.288 --> 30:37.578
Hey, Rory, one of those little acrobat boys told me my breath smells stinky.

30:37.646 --> 30:39.621
- They're running wild.
- Acro-brats, I call them.

30:39.699 --> 30:40.882
- Ha, nice!
- Thank you.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.838
- Got your ferret.
- Oh, he looks mean.

30:42.914 --> 30:46.503
I don't think there's any such thing as a friendly ferret and definitely not a cute one.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.075
Yeah, they got dealt a rough card, those ferrets.

30:49.165 --> 30:51.162
Oh, hey, art nouveau clock girl, hands off the face.

30:51.249 --> 30:55.407
What? Art nouveau clock girl touched her face? This place is bedlam.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.755
Oh, relax, Taylor. We're right on schedule. Have a cigarette.

30:58.838 --> 31:01.520
- I don't smoke.
- Could you start?

31:01.884 --> 31:04.772
Taylor, look, your cousin came to visit you backstage to say hello.

31:04.839 --> 31:09.611
Oh, hello! What a pretty night it is for a festival! Do you have a mouse? I'm feeling a bit peckish.

31:09.692 --> 31:12.457
- Put that down.
- Just trying to lighten the mood.

31:12.533 --> 31:18.182
It's too late. That Hank from Woodbury is sitting front-row center just trying to psych me out.

31:18.258 --> 31:22.333
- Everybody's ready, Taylor, really.
- I hope everybody is ready.

31:22.425 --> 31:24.422
Hey, let's all be friends. Can I nibble your neck?

31:24.561 --> 31:28.012
- He's really got his knickers in a twist tonight.
- Hey, talk more like a ferret.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.503
- Sorry, time to attach it.
- So, is Sookie okay?

31:31.620 --> 31:34.672
Oh, she's great. Still big, still waiting, but she's fine.

31:34.744 --> 31:35.595
Oh, good.

31:35.722 --> 31:38.594
Was she the one shaking me in the middle of the night yelling,

31:38.672 --> 31:40.770
"what motivated you to come out of your mother" over and over?

31:40.847 --> 31:43.295
She got a little spooked. There.

31:43.444 --> 31:46.485
- Wow. You're beautiful, Anthea.
- I feel very painty.

31:46.644 --> 31:49.475
- I gotta go change. Freeze good.
- I will.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.542
The time approaches. I am ready.

31:52.654 --> 31:55.660
You might want to check that Gumby/Pokey watch, Kirk.

31:56.049 --> 31:58.896
Right. Sorry. And it's a collectible, not a toy.

31:58.997 --> 32:01.221
It's an adult... it's very valuable.

32:05.285 --> 32:09.785
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Taylor Doose.

32:10.026 --> 32:15.808
Welcome to the 43rd annual Connecticut Festival of Living Pictures.

32:18.860 --> 32:23.379
As you may know, the town of Woodbury was supposed to host this year's festival,

32:23.467 --> 32:27.746
but due to their recent flooding, Woodbury backed out.

32:27.910 --> 32:34.178
They got a little moisture over there and basically said, "Oh, well, whatever, never mind."

32:34.254 --> 32:38.297
But the town of Stars Hollow was happy to step in

32:38.372 --> 32:42.555
because this vital tradition must continue.

32:44.403 --> 32:48.131
"The Festival of Living Pictures" has a storied history...

32:48.232 --> 32:51.377
Cecilia - that's a very pretty name. Very pretty.

32:51.464 --> 32:53.158
Keep it in your pants, Andrew.

32:53.378 --> 32:57.270
Okay, listen up, people. The fire department is out here

32:57.356 --> 33:02.327
because some dingbat parked in the red zone. Now, I warned you guys about parking there.

33:02.446 --> 33:07.454
So, who is it? Come on, speak up or you're gonna be towed. Who is it?

33:07.555 --> 33:09.957
I saw it when I came in, I think that's Kirk's.

33:10.105 --> 33:13.371
- You Judas!
- Go move it, Kirk!

33:13.515 --> 33:16.914
- Just trying to help.
- Shouldn't you kiss me on the cheek before you betray me?

33:16.977 --> 33:19.075
- You're gonna get towed.
- Just keep away from me, pal!

33:19.167 --> 33:21.477
You know, I'm getting a little tired of this holier-than-thou attitude of yours.

33:21.569 --> 33:24.349
- I mean it.
- Rory, go, go, you're on.

33:24.764 --> 33:27.764
Hey, art nouveau clock girl, you got your Zippo on you?

33:27.877 --> 33:33.064
Our first tableau was created by the talented craftsmen in our little town.

33:33.161 --> 33:38.537
It is a painting by the Italian master Girolamo Parmigianino.

33:38.681 --> 33:44.992
He was born in Parma and was of the mannerist school, becoming a master portraitist,

33:45.091 --> 33:50.093
blending the sensual style with the classical style of Raphael,

33:50.196 --> 33:56.622
as you can see in his "Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."

34:11.668 --> 34:14.864
Five minutes to "The Last Supper", people, five minutes.

34:17.967 --> 34:21.661
Oh, my God! Christ, Judas, stop fighting!

34:22.005 --> 34:25.176
Shame you apostles, why couldn't you get in there and stop 'em?

34:28.641 --> 34:32.339
If I've re-pulled my calf muscle, you are so getting it!

34:32.415 --> 34:35.159
So perform a miracle and unpull it, you jerk!

34:35.268 --> 34:38.186
You're a blasphemer! You're a blasphemer and a traitor!

34:38.333 --> 34:41.329
- And let's face it, you're unattractive.
- Okay, we got no time for this.

34:41.409 --> 34:46.869
Get your butts on that stage! And, apostles, keep Christ and Judas apart!

34:47.145 --> 34:53.654
Da vinci's "Last Supper" has become one of the most revered masterpieces in the world.

34:53.775 --> 35:02.229
This majestic fresco was completed in 1498 and its prestige has never diminished.

35:02.332 --> 35:05.669
You've been a jerk from the start! What about Shakey's?

35:05.757 --> 35:07.963
- You all went out without me, and you lied about it.
- You're imagining things.

35:08.066 --> 35:12.894
Well, Simon Peter said so. James, the son of Alpheus, Lebbeus - they all said so.

35:12.966 --> 35:16.662
- When did you speak with Lebbeus?
- God help me, if you two don't shut up,

35:16.740 --> 35:22.136
I'm gonna stick these papier-mché rolls down your throats! That's it! That's it! Curtain!

35:22.915 --> 35:27.522
And so now may we present "The Last Supper."

35:49.164 --> 35:50.992
So I was good? The ferret didn't upstage me?

35:51.095 --> 35:52.616
The ferret underplayed it nicely.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.709
Hey, isn't that that guitarist?

35:55.519 --> 35:59.624
It is. It's Gil. Rats, I was gonna call him tomorrow with the bad news.

35:59.753 --> 36:01.499
Well, you could just walk away rudely.

36:01.703 --> 36:04.084
I'll say a quick hello and tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

36:06.676 --> 36:08.801
Hey, Lane. Trippy, huh?

36:08.923 --> 36:10.925
Totally. How you doin', Gil?

36:11.155 --> 36:13.633
Great. I saw the flyers, I thought I'd come check it out.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.501
Cool, great, yeah.

36:16.573 --> 36:19.061
- Hey, don't sweat it, okay?
- What do you mean?

36:19.358 --> 36:21.729
It's okay. I know I'm not in the band.

36:21.923 --> 36:27.625
I picked up the vibe. The age difference... it doesn't bother me, but it's a little weird, I know.

36:27.749 --> 36:29.832
- Maybe a little.
- It's cool, really.

36:30.073 --> 36:34.241
Good. Well, you're a great guy, Gil, and a great guitarist.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.510
- Someone's gonna scoop you up quick.
- I hope so.

36:36.642 --> 36:39.844
- I'm gonna keep going no matter what, not like last time.
- Last time?

36:39.971 --> 36:44.656
Yeah. I had another band, a great band, the hottest band in L.A.

36:44.804 --> 36:49.632
We sold out all the clubs - The House of Blues, The Whiskey. A&R guys were hanging out.

36:49.843 --> 36:52.765
We had an awesome demo with tunes. Then we got our big break -

36:52.893 --> 36:56.380
an opening slot on a national tour with Quiet Riot.

36:56.933 --> 37:01.341
But we blew it. We were fighting all the time over money, over chicks.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.046
- We broke up before the tour even started.
- Oh no.

37:04.256 --> 37:09.237
It killed me. I didn't touch my Axe for years. I just got a day gig and lived my life.

37:09.775 --> 37:13.414
Then a few months ago, I picked up my guitar, and I realized how much I missed it.

37:13.553 --> 37:15.631
So I went out looking again, and that's how you got my tape.

37:16.569 --> 37:18.755
But I'm not stopping this time for anything.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.973
I'm gonna keep going until it happens.

37:21.996 --> 37:25.842
But thanks for letting me play with you guys. It was a blast. You're fantastic.

37:27.757 --> 37:31.637
Well, get used to playing with us, Gil, 'cause you're in the band.

37:31.857 --> 37:33.122
- Really?
- Really.

37:33.296 --> 37:34.883
- No way!
- Way.

37:35.551 --> 37:38.253
Oh, my God! This is so cool! I can't believe it.

37:38.369 --> 37:41.135
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

37:41.601 --> 37:44.559
Honey, kids, I am in the band!

37:47.001 --> 37:50.306
- Our guitarist is married.
- You made his kids happy, too.

37:56.695 --> 37:59.479
You guys watched the first two "Matrix"s on DVD together, too.

37:59.706 --> 38:01.906
- I heard all about it.
- Get away from me.

38:02.214 --> 38:06.750
"The Last Supper," ladies and gentlemen. Serene, wasn't it?

38:10.155 --> 38:11.850
Better order quick. We're closing...

38:13.744 --> 38:16.073
- Soon.
- Surprise.

38:16.207 --> 38:17.109
I'll say.

38:17.851 --> 38:22.756
- Lots of nuttiness going on out there.
- Yeah, it's the festival of nutty pictures, so...

38:23.191 --> 38:27.681
- You successfully avoid the nuttiness?
- Yeah, for the most part, yeah.

38:27.921 --> 38:31.507
Christ's table was broken, so I fixed it.

38:31.788 --> 38:34.353
- He's a carpenter, he should have fixed it himself.
- Yeah, well...

38:34.645 --> 38:39.098
Speaking of nutty... all this, you and me.

38:39.985 --> 38:44.126
- If it were happening to anyone else, I'd laugh.
- About what?

38:44.275 --> 38:48.439
Well, getting married is what broke us up. You gotta love the irony.

38:48.679 --> 38:50.742
Yeah, it is a little ironic.

38:52.093 --> 38:55.924
Luke, I'm not gonna say that getting married on that ship like we did wasn't wrong.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.606
We should have thought more about it, but...

38:58.842 --> 39:02.195
maybe rushing into divorce would be just as wrong.

39:02.534 --> 39:04.724
- What are you talking about?
- Well, we're still you and me.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.821
- Why can't we have what we had before?
- Which was?

39:08.985 --> 39:12.314
- Two people who loved being together.
- We're in the middle of a divorce.

39:12.446 --> 39:14.744
- We can postpone it.
- We can?

39:14.852 --> 39:16.352
I'm a lawyer, I know these things.

39:17.596 --> 39:19.778
- Postpone it and do what?
- Date.

39:19.956 --> 39:22.471
- Date?
- Remember? That was the fun part.

39:23.371 --> 39:26.567
So what you're saying is we get back together,

39:26.690 --> 39:31.395
- not divorced, but not be married, either?
- I guess.

39:32.219 --> 39:37.385
I know it sounds stupid, but it doesn't feel stupid, does it?

39:40.852 --> 39:45.593
Picasso's "Guernica," everybody. Wasn't that something?

39:46.023 --> 39:53.288
Our next work is found in the gardens of Versailles in the country of our former ally, France.

39:53.401 --> 39:59.603
It is one of more than two thousand sculptures to be found in that famed garden.

39:59.970 --> 40:06.381
I'd like to turn your attention now to our town's beloved gazebo for "The Reaper."

40:19.135 --> 40:21.675
Okay, our statue's done. Stamp it, ship it.

40:21.798 --> 40:25.718
Terrence and Lorelai, our Renoir couple, you're up next. Be ready.

40:25.821 --> 40:28.023
Okay, I'm just about done here, Patty. Just give me one second.

40:28.145 --> 40:31.950
Okay, I'm just saying, two-minute warning. Terrence, get into place.

40:32.067 --> 40:34.055
My aching feet will never forgive me.

40:34.863 --> 40:37.106
- You ready for your close-up, Miss Desmond?
- Just about.

40:37.239 --> 40:39.123
Grand finale. It's a great way to close this thing.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.294
You know, I don't know why everybody's rushing me like this.

40:41.580 --> 40:44.791
- Mom... you okay?
- Yeah.

40:45.836 --> 40:47.264
- No.
- No?

40:47.520 --> 40:50.801
My heart is going a million miles a second. I feel hot. Is my makeup running?

40:50.909 --> 40:52.368
No, Mom, you look great. What's wrong?

40:52.809 --> 40:55.461
- I flinched.
- What?

40:55.666 --> 40:58.635
Seven years ago on this very stage in this very costume, I flinched.

40:58.743 --> 41:00.437
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

41:00.601 --> 41:05.834
You weren't watching. I was in denial. I just didn't want Taylor to be right, but he was. I flinched.

41:05.936 --> 41:09.249
Well, so what? You flinched a little. I bet most people didn't see it.

41:09.337 --> 41:11.497
Stevie Wonder could have seen it. I almost knocked Terrence down.

41:11.570 --> 41:15.112
- I flinched. I am a big, fat flincher!
- But that was a long time ago.

41:15.195 --> 41:17.579
- Once a flincher, always a flincher.
- No, no, Mom.

41:17.661 --> 41:22.055
- That was seven years ago. You're different now.
- Yeah, I am. I'm less stable.

41:22.156 --> 41:25.455
My muscles are weaker and my bones are more fragile.

41:25.556 --> 41:30.072
There are a dozen more ways for me to wobble now. I'm a Weeble, and Weebles wobble.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.294
- I'm gonna blow the whole finale and the town is gonna hate me.
- Mom, listen.

41:33.366 --> 41:37.312
You are in amazing physical shape. This is mental. You can beat it.

41:37.420 --> 41:38.786
How?

41:38.880 --> 41:40.456
'Cause you can.

41:41.408 --> 41:43.543
- No specifics?
- Not really.

41:44.123 --> 41:45.585
I need something.

41:46.178 --> 41:49.478
- Close your eyes and think of England.
- Okay.

41:49.770 --> 41:54.336
And know that I love you no matter what happens up there and go be still.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.098
- England, England.
- England.

41:58.151 --> 42:01.883
She's not gonna flinch, is she? Is she?

42:02.329 --> 42:07.367
... made Pierre Auguste Renoir one of the world's most beloved painters.

42:07.644 --> 42:17.019
So to close our triumphant evening, we give you his incomparable "Dance at Bougival."

42:27.540 --> 42:29.384
Good girl. Keep it up.

42:35.784 --> 42:40.268
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

42:40.387 --> 42:42.567
- What the hell is that?
- It's Sookie's baby pager.

42:43.226 --> 42:44.805
Oy to the vey!

42:48.600 --> 42:52.050
- I can't look.
- Keep frozen. Keep frozen.

42:52.116 --> 42:53.187
What's happening?

42:59.336 --> 43:01.957
That's it. Curtain!

43:12.534 --> 43:18.561
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making tonight such a success.

43:18.977 --> 43:22.355
On behalf of the town of Stars Hollow,

43:22.432 --> 43:27.997
we bid you adieu from "The Festival of Living Pictures."
