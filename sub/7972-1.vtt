from this moment of crisis
triumphant.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.964
His middle period
is characterized
by a heroic tone,

15:32.799 --> 15:34.801
as in his opera, Fidelio,

15:37.370 --> 15:41.541
where a wife
saves her imprisoned husband
from murder

15:41.608 --> 15:43.643
at the hands of his enemy.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.582

Don't be scared,

I stopped seeing you
after your mom died.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.895
I always wanted a sister.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.298
You know,
maybe if you would have had a
female influence in your life,

16:05.398 --> 16:07.734
you wouldn't
look like a janitor.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.339
There, looks perfect.

Now you actually
look like a woman.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.473
After that,
my father became my world.

When I was little,
even if I was just
practicing scales,

17:47.867 --> 17:49.602
my father
would press his back

17:49.702 --> 17:52.872
against the base
of our upright piano
with his eyes closed

17:52.905 --> 17:56.243
so that he could
feel the vibrations
of the piano strings.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.846
It was his way of listening.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.963

18:19.932 --> 18:22.802
I was playing with
the ketchup on my plate.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.442
My father told me he had to
run across the street
to the bank.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.246
I said
I had to go to the bathroom.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.485
He told me to meet him
in front of the restaurant.

By the time I got there,
there were people everywhere.

18:50.230 --> 18:54.000
My father had run
in front of a truck
and was killed.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.951
The police officer told me
that he probably
died on impact.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.321
It was fast,
there was no pain.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.625
I'm supposed to
find comfort in that.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.696
For the record,
he had looked both ways,

19:23.796 --> 19:27.133
but he couldn't
hear the truck's horn
honking at him.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.470
No one ran to save him.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.341
No one bothered
to run out and grab him.

19:34.474 --> 19:38.144
If I had been there with him,
it would have been different.

But now that I feel
like I know you again,
all that's changed.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.762

that there's someone

36:03.829 --> 36:05.664
whose life sucks
more than mine.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.702
I'm gonna kill my dad, Dot.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.673
Tonight.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.846
I hate him, you know.

36:20.946 --> 36:23.982
I hate him but I love him.

36:24.049 --> 36:26.552
I hate it when he
won't let me go out
with my friends,

36:26.652 --> 36:29.888
but I love it
when he fucks me.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.558
I hate when he
fucks me, too, though.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.125
You see how that works?

36:34.159 --> 36:35.661
It doesn't make any sense.

36:40.499 --> 36:43.535
He likes it when
I bite on his nipples, though.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.174
I stick the tip of his nipple
between my teeth

36:49.241 --> 36:53.579
and I rub my tongue
back and forth on it,
like a windshield wiper.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.985
It drives him wild.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.354
I made him come once
just by sucking
on his nipples.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.756
I didn't even have to touch
his dick once.

that I can tell you this shit.

it's off my chest,

you know?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.610
I know where it is.

it'd be too gross.

53:43.588 --> 53:45.222
I didn't see you there.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.827
I suck at basketball and...

54:00.871 --> 54:02.106
CONNOR: You know,
usually when we win,

54:02.206 --> 54:03.341
there's a whole
bunch of people

54:03.408 --> 54:05.576
waiting outside
of our locker room,

54:05.676 --> 54:07.211
cheering us on.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.782
Got out fast today.

54:17.288 --> 54:19.023
Nobody likes a loser.

54:28.633 --> 54:31.268
You know,
I was thinking
about you last night.

54:34.805 --> 54:36.541
I was thinking that

54:38.309 --> 54:41.111
if we went on a road trip,
how quiet it would be.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.951
You know,
we could go all the way

54:47.051 --> 54:49.420
through Long Island, to, uh,
to Pennsylvania.

54:49.487 --> 54:52.323
You know,
that's where they make
Hershey's chocolate.

54:52.423 --> 54:53.824
Pennsylvania.

54:53.924 --> 54:57.662
And, uh, all the lamp posts
look like Hershey's Kisses.

54:59.163 --> 55:01.666
They give you free M&M's
at the factory.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.271
I can smell your hair.

55:08.773 --> 55:10.775
It smells like cucumbers.

55:16.080 --> 55:20.317
I--I got really,
really hard last night.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.988
I had to beat off.

55:26.691 --> 55:30.695
And my mom
was just outside of my room,
putting the towels away.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.663
You know, I could hear her,

55:34.799 --> 55:36.601
but I couldn't help myself.

55:38.869 --> 55:41.472
I mean, I came four times.

55:44.308 --> 55:46.844
I mean, four times,
that--that isn't normal,
is it?

55:57.388 --> 55:58.889
What am I gonna do?

56:02.827 --> 56:05.129
I'm this sex addict
with a learning disorder

56:05.195 --> 56:08.132
who forgot
how to play basketball.

56:08.198 --> 56:11.368
OLIVIA: The landscaper's
coming at noon tomorrow.

56:12.637 --> 56:14.138
You told me already.

56:15.172 --> 56:18.643
Is Nina
at the basketball game?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.711
She's your daughter.
You don't know where she is?

56:20.811 --> 56:24.214
Well, of course I know
where she is,
she's at the basketball game.

56:24.314 --> 56:27.418
That boy that came
over the other night
was on the basketball team.

56:27.518 --> 56:28.653
I thought he was very cute.

56:28.719 --> 56:29.754
Cute?

56:29.854 --> 56:31.088
OLIVIA: For Nina.

56:36.093 --> 56:37.695
PAUL: Careful, Olivia.

56:39.029 --> 56:42.032
What with all
these music videos
and magazines,

56:42.099 --> 56:43.333
do you really
think she needs you

56:43.400 --> 56:45.770
to push her into dating
and dressing like a slut?

56:52.910 --> 56:54.011
Paul?

56:55.112 --> 56:57.114
Have I gotten fat?

56:57.214 --> 56:58.616
She's only 17.

56:58.716 --> 57:00.518
When you were 17,
you were still a virgin.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.091
Come on, just look.
You didn't even look.

57:07.124 --> 57:09.026
Come here,
see if you can pinch an inch.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.394
See if you can pinch an inch.

57:10.461 --> 57:11.629
Good night.

57:14.298 --> 57:17.101
OLIVIA: You're mean.
I'm sleeping on the floor.

57:28.245 --> 57:30.247
PAUL: Get into bed, Olivia.

57:30.314 --> 57:32.282
I don't want to,
I'm comfortable here.

57:32.783 --> 57:33.951
Get into bed.

57:34.051 --> 57:35.486
Leave me alone!

57:35.586 --> 57:38.255
Olivia, get into bed.
You're gonna catch a cold.

57:38.322 --> 57:40.224
Yeah,
it'll be all your fault.

57:50.568 --> 57:53.137
(CHUCKLES) See, I'm still
as light as a feather.

57:56.173 --> 57:58.809
You know, I've kissed
a bunch of girls before.

58:00.144 --> 58:01.746
It's all right.

58:03.848 --> 58:06.651
But I've never done it,
you know, the it.

58:08.786 --> 58:10.354
Stuck it inside.

58:16.293 --> 58:17.361
What?

58:19.163 --> 58:20.497
What is it?

58:49.894 --> 58:51.528

Where's Dot?

59:26.430 --> 59:28.432
How am I supposed to know?

59:32.436 --> 59:33.537
How was the game?

59:33.604 --> 59:34.605
It sucked.

59:36.173 --> 59:37.374
We lost.

59:41.612 --> 59:43.714
Don't get it on my uniform.

59:44.949 --> 59:47.718
I've got something
that might make
you feel better.

59:47.785 --> 59:48.886
What?

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.767
Daddy!
Open it.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:06.370
What? Oh, my God!

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.438
I told you
I got you a present.
I love it!

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:10.641
You really like it?
Yes, I love it.

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:13.711
I love it, Dad.
It's so great.

01:00:13.778 --> 01:00:16.280
(GIGGLING) Wait a minute,
Dad, wait a minute.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.782
What's the matter?

01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:19.717
Stop.

01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:23.620
Gosh. I gotta iron my uniform
before I go to bed.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.091
So...

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.460
I'll be in my room.

Oh, shit.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.634
Do you think
I have a big dick, Dot?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.103
I mean, I've measured it.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:16.206
It's pretty small
when it's soft,

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.643
but when it gets hard,
it's--it's pretty big.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.287
Wait.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.222

I knocked
and waited this time.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.439
Don't do that,
I can't see what I'm doing.

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.574
I'll burn myself
and be disfigured.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.181
Dad, I gotta do this.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.449
Iron it before the next game.

I like to iron it

Dad, I have a secret for you.

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:48.899
You do?
Yeah.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.935
A surprise.
Really?

gonna yell at her

No, no, no, no, no.
Not right now. I'm still

Yeah.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:17.287
I have to tell you something,
but you have to promise
not to get angry.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:20.457
Of course, of course, honey,
anything. Anything.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.460
You have to promise first.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:25.896
Just tell me.

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.465
Do you promise?
I promise.

How do you know?
I took a test!

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.556
Those tests aren't accurate.

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:55.092
They're 97% accurate, Daddy,

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:57.894
and I haven't had
a period in six weeks.

gonna do about it?

No, I mean,

she's not right for you.

what's right for me?

01:09:37.874 --> 01:09:39.676
I could work at a bar

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:43.279
or be a stripper.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:47.317
I saw this show on MTV
about strippers.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:50.554
They make a lot of money
and it's easy, I guess.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.122
Some of them
even become famous,
like Courtney Love.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.359
She--She was a stripper.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.796
I could be like her, maybe.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.031

I wouldn't really care,

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:04.200

looking at my tits.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.573
Wouldn't matter,
at least I'd be getting paid.

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.046
It was so hard

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.817
to lie to my dad
about being pregnant

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.886
that I think
a part of me thinks it's true.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:27.757
Is that crazy?

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.335
I'll have $1,000, though.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:42.071
That'll be enough
to get me started in New Haven
before I have to get a job.

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.507
It'll be perfect.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.744
You know, I am not letting you
go to the dance
without lipstick,

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:50.246
I just can't do it.

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:53.016
This one
smells like strawberries.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.019
Connor will go crazy
when you go to kiss him.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.290
Perfect.

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.127
Now you almost look human.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:32.322

the loudest silence
in history.

the dance like this.

should be pumping gas.

He's totally hot for you!

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.148

on your secret?

DOT: They say that the truth
can set you free.

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:23.339
That's a lie.

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:28.678
The truth is,
lies can protect us.

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:32.348
Lies keep us safe

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.819

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:27.771
PAUL: $1,000,
isn't that what you said?

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:30.339
$1,000, right.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.575
So you can fix the problem.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.443
Right. Fix.

01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:36.279
Because you're pregnant,
I went to
the bank and got cash.

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:38.548
Great.
Because you're pregnant.

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:40.617
Dad, I really wish
that you would
stop saying it.

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.218
That you're pregnant?
Stop it!

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:44.353
What?
You're pregnant, aren't you?
Dad.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.556
I can keep saying it.
Well,
I really wish you wouldn't!

No!

I can say it
over and over again.

how many times
I repeat it,

no matter how many times
I repeat it,

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.606
it still
doesn't make it true,
isn't that right, Nina?

01:14:02.706 --> 01:14:03.740

As a present.
And this is how you repay me?

to hide your lies?

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.554
NINA: Where are we going?
DOT: Follow me.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.837
DOT: Here.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.541
I think that's deep enough.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:28.991
I never got
to bury my father.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.067
Your father must have known

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:41.670
that you could hear.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.310
It was our secret.

01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:58.354
Why did you do it?

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:04.493
Because you wouldn't.

01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:14.437
No, I mean,

01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:17.673
why did you pretend
you were deaf
in the first place?

01:26:22.144 --> 01:26:23.379
I just...

01:26:25.448 --> 01:26:27.616
I wanted to be closer to him.

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:35.958
And invisible
to everyone else.

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:43.299
Well, you can't now.

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:46.302
Why?

01:26:46.335 --> 01:26:48.237
Because then
we'll both be alone.

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:24.840
Let's go home.

Mom!
Where are they taking you?

01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:01.777
Nina, hold on,
I'm going to go away
for a little while, okay?

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:03.712
I'm not--I'm not well.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.815
I did a terrible,
terrible thing.

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:08.717
I killed your father.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.655
He went crazy.
He was throwing things,

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.990
and breaking things,
and he told me he hated me.

01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:17.926
And I--I took a piano wire

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:21.397
and-- and I strangled him
with it.

01:28:21.464 --> 01:28:22.765
POLICE OFFICER: Okay,
time's up.

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:25.468
Hold on one second!
Just let me finish.

01:28:25.568 --> 01:28:27.503
I didn't want
him to hurt you.

01:28:27.603 --> 01:28:29.505
Nina, I never
wanted him to hurt you.

01:28:32.174 --> 01:28:34.977
I'm sorry, Nina.
Can you ever forgive me?

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.415
I am so sorry.

about the quiet
before the storm

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:10.112
but no one talks
about the quiet after.

(PIANO PLAYING)

01:29:22.658 --> 01:29:24.660
At least after the storm

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:28.664
you know it's really over.

01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:52.220
When Beethoven died in 1827,

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:54.857
over 10,000
people came to mourn.

01:29:59.595 --> 01:30:02.931
DOT: From the beginning.

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:07.169
DOT: I used to fantasize
that when I died
there wouldn't be a funeral.

01:30:09.037 --> 01:30:13.075
Having led my life invisibly,
no one would come to mourn.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:27.856
But being invisible
isn't worth it in the end.

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:32.928
Because when you're invisible,
other people may not see you

01:30:33.028 --> 01:30:35.698
but you can't help
seeing other people.
