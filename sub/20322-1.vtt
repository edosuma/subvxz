00:59.660 --> 01:01.560
- Here we go.
- Where's your smile?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.162
Where's your smile?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.096
Aww. She was laughing.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.965
What an angel!

01:07.000 --> 01:10.502
Well, you should have seen her at four
o'clock in the morning making a fuss.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.504
Ohhh. Honestly,

01:12.572 --> 01:14.740
I never could have imagined
this a few months ago.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.909
This can't be as awesome
as running around with me

01:16.943 --> 01:18.876
chasing bad guys, though, right? Well...

01:18.944 --> 01:21.580
Hey, hey. Don't tempt
her. You're a bad man.

01:21.647 --> 01:24.416
- No, no, no, not me.
- Cheers.

01:24.483 --> 01:26.418
The club's been getting busy,

01:26.485 --> 01:29.787
so... it's a luxury having
one of us at home. A few more

01:29.855 --> 01:33.758
weeks of Adam's cooking, and I'm not
gonna be able to chase anyone anywhere.

01:33.826 --> 01:35.601
- Nice.
- Guilty as charged.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.342
Hey speaking of home, how's the new place?

01:38.343 --> 01:39.670
It's great. The painting's almost done,

01:39.798 --> 01:42.734
we've got the furniture in, and we
just gotta put stuff up on the walls.

01:42.801 --> 01:44.936
Must be different decorating for two.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.527
Tia's been doing most of the work.

01:46.528 --> 01:48.820
She's got great taste.
Maybe not in men, but...

01:48.833 --> 01:51.074
- Come on.
- Makes me feel a bit grown up, though.

01:51.142 --> 01:54.177
- Why don't you try one of these on for size?
- Yeah!

01:54.246 --> 01:56.247
That's right. Hey.

01:56.314 --> 01:59.250
- Yeah, I gotta take this. Excuse me.
- Ok.

01:59.317 --> 02:01.017
Hey.

02:01.085 --> 02:03.787
What's up?

02:03.855 --> 02:05.789
When did it happen?

02:05.823 --> 02:07.791
I'll be right there.

02:07.825 --> 02:09.359
What do you see?

02:09.425 --> 02:12.695
I, uh, actually I've got
to get going. That was Dev.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.697
- What's going on?
- A homicide.

02:14.732 --> 02:17.768
- He said I had to see it to believe it.
- Sounds interesting.

02:17.835 --> 02:18.833
I'll message you later.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.750
- Adam, good to see you.
- You too, Toby.

02:24.941 --> 02:27.243
I wonder what's up.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.555
Someone had a bad day.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.157
Yeah, the worst.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.261
Vic was Sandra Perry.

02:45.328 --> 02:47.562
She was a partner here
at Carver Communications,

02:47.597 --> 02:49.564
one of the biggest ad agencies in the city.

02:49.599 --> 02:51.366
- Enemies?
- According to our employees,

02:51.401 --> 02:53.568
- everybody loved her.
- Well, not quite everybody.

02:53.603 --> 02:55.097
So, why is this on our radar?

02:55.098 --> 02:56.645
Well, there's something you should see.

02:56.673 --> 02:58.307
Oh, that's creepy.

02:58.341 --> 03:00.241
- Yeah.
- She was bitten?

03:00.276 --> 03:02.243
No, shot.

03:02.278 --> 03:04.979
The snakes were put on her after the fact.

03:05.014 --> 03:06.682
Whoa.

03:06.716 --> 03:08.517
Yeah.

03:08.551 --> 03:10.018
But, um...

03:10.052 --> 03:11.620
Yeah.

03:15.724 --> 03:18.193
Can you give us a minute with the room?

03:18.227 --> 03:21.029
And, uh, keep all this
under wraps, please...

03:21.063 --> 03:24.565
no talking to the media.

03:24.599 --> 03:27.235
So, you asked why we caught the case.

03:27.269 --> 03:29.035
There were three identical
murders four years ago.

03:29.036 --> 03:30.036
Snakes were present on the scene.

03:30.238 --> 03:32.340
It was all over the
internet. The Serpent Murders.

03:32.374 --> 03:35.943
Right? Did they ever
figure out why the snakes?

03:35.977 --> 03:38.813
Well, best guess was
that snakes are a symbol

03:38.847 --> 03:41.382
of vengefulness in some
mythologies. You know,

03:41.416 --> 03:43.718
Satan was portrayed by a snake
in the Garden of Eden, etc.

03:43.752 --> 03:45.553
Right. They caught the guy, though.

03:45.587 --> 03:48.222
That's why they called us.

03:48.256 --> 03:51.391
The man who committed the
murders, Samuel Murley,

03:51.425 --> 03:53.393
was arrested and convicted three years ago.

03:53.427 --> 03:55.262
He's currently playing
house in a federal prison.

03:55.296 --> 03:58.565
- So what's this, a copycat?
- That or...

03:58.632 --> 04:00.533
we caught the wrong guy.

04:00.568 --> 04:03.470
A mistake like that would bring a lot
of heat onto the arresting officer.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.238
That arresting officer is

04:05.305 --> 04:07.841
our very own Sergeant Michelle McCluskey.

04:13.180 --> 04:19.202
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:24.047 --> 04:26.015
It's days like this that
make living worthwhile.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.017
The thrill of hunting a killer?

04:28.085 --> 04:29.652
No.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.358
- Snake poop.
- You're going somewhere with this?

04:35.426 --> 04:39.262
I was able to determine what the snakes
ate the last few days before they died.

04:39.330 --> 04:42.031
- And that's important because?
- The snakes are exotics, but

04:42.099 --> 04:43.108
we couldn't track them
through local stores,

04:43.109 --> 04:45.069
which means that the
killer bred them himself.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.771
- So they're a dead end?
- That's where the rat poop comes into play.

04:48.839 --> 04:51.707
The snakes were fed standard rats
like you'd buy in a pet store,

04:51.775 --> 04:55.144
but the killer probably bred them
as well so as to not leave a trail.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.779
But the rats were fed dog food...

04:57.847 --> 05:00.081
specifically, according to the
levels of copper proteinate,

05:00.116 --> 05:02.817
fishmeal, and cracked barley, Tipper brand.

05:02.852 --> 05:05.954
♪ Your best friend's best meal ever ♪

05:06.022 --> 05:07.956
I love that... I love that commercial.

05:07.990 --> 05:10.492
I know, right? Uh, Tipper was

05:10.560 --> 05:13.128
also fed to the rats
in the original murder.

05:13.162 --> 05:15.664
I'm gonna track listings
of local pet food retailers

05:15.731 --> 05:17.666
that stock the brand. I may
be able to track the killer

05:17.733 --> 05:20.487
- through atypical purchases.
- Here's another interesting detail.

05:20.535 --> 05:22.503
The victim's tongue was slit.

05:22.538 --> 05:25.306
Just like the three original
victims of the Serpent Murders.

05:25.374 --> 05:27.742
The split tongue was made
public during the trials,

05:27.810 --> 05:30.077
but the brand of dog food wasn't.

05:30.111 --> 05:32.413
Did you run the bullet used to kill her?

05:34.349 --> 05:37.785
Nine millimetre, same calibre as used
in the original murders, and it appears

05:37.819 --> 05:41.121
- to be from the same weapon.
- Which we still haven't retrieved.

05:41.156 --> 05:43.123
What do we know about Murley?

05:43.158 --> 05:45.125
Well, he's a top-flight plastic surgeon.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.194
Rosedale, Forest Hill clientele.

05:47.261 --> 05:50.597
Michelle originally made the connection
that all three of those original victims

05:50.631 --> 05:53.433
consulted with him about
their plastic surgery, and

05:53.467 --> 05:55.635
all three of them went
elsewhere to get their work done.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.638
All right, so, seeing as Michelle
is so zoned in on this case,

05:58.673 --> 06:00.640
don't you think we should bring her in?

06:00.675 --> 06:03.443
Someone leaked the details of
Sandra's murder to the media,

06:03.477 --> 06:05.445
and they're already
making a circus out of it.

06:05.479 --> 06:07.681
I think we should leave
her out of it for now.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.350
I want to hit this case hard.

06:10.384 --> 06:12.051
I want fresh eyes.

06:12.086 --> 06:14.721
I just got a text.

06:14.755 --> 06:17.790
Looks like the victim's husband's
upstairs. They need us up there ASAP.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.726
Mr. Perry?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.728
We're sorry for your loss.

06:21.762 --> 06:24.230
I want to know why someone killed my wife.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.132
Are you sure that she
didn't have any enemies?

06:26.166 --> 06:28.300
This is a woman who
volunteered for charities.

06:28.335 --> 06:29.969
Everybody loved her...

06:30.003 --> 06:32.238
her employees, friends...

06:32.272 --> 06:35.141
Sandra.

06:35.175 --> 06:37.142
What am I gonna do?

06:37.176 --> 06:39.811
Were there any new people in her life?

06:39.846 --> 06:42.314
What, you mean like lovers?

06:42.349 --> 06:44.783
We mean people she may
have done business with.

06:44.851 --> 06:48.053
People who called at home. People
who may have become fixated on her.

06:48.121 --> 06:49.588
No, nothing like that.

06:49.623 --> 06:52.323
Your wife ever have cosmetic surgery done?

06:52.358 --> 06:55.360
She was comfortable with her looks.
She would never go in for surgery.

06:55.427 --> 06:59.131
TV said that there were snakes there.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.500
Her tongue was cut.

07:02.568 --> 07:05.637
Just like the women that
were killed a few years ago.

07:05.704 --> 07:07.405
There were snakes,

07:07.473 --> 07:09.840
but as far as a connection
goes, we're not sure of that yet.

07:09.908 --> 07:11.752
You don't want to admit you
didn't catch him the last time.

07:11.755 --> 07:14.267
Mr. Perry, we are very confident
that we put away the right man.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.268
You have to say that.

07:16.448 --> 07:18.916
Protecting your own.

07:18.950 --> 07:22.920
But we all know... my wife

07:22.954 --> 07:25.555
died because you let the real killer walk.

07:31.263 --> 07:35.632
Mr. Pelc, taking into account the snakes
found at the scene of this most recent crime...

07:35.667 --> 07:38.202
Wait, go back for a sec.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.204
It should be clear to everyone

07:40.272 --> 07:42.406
that this validates our contention

07:42.473 --> 07:44.808
that Dr. Samuel Murley did not commit

07:44.875 --> 07:47.143
the so-called Serpent Murders.

07:47.211 --> 07:50.480
The IIB imprisoned the
wrong man, and what's worse,

07:50.548 --> 07:54.083
allowed the real killer to walk free,
giving them the opportunity to kill again.

07:54.151 --> 07:57.487
The IIB must be held accountable.

07:57.522 --> 07:59.622
That's what this is about,
folks. That's all for now.

07:59.690 --> 08:01.390
Thank you very much.

08:01.425 --> 08:03.392
- We got the right guy.
- I know you did.

08:03.427 --> 08:05.561
But they're saying I could
have put away an innocent man.

08:05.629 --> 08:07.630
Toby and the guys, they can handle this.

08:07.698 --> 08:09.632
I know the case better than anyone else.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.968
And if they need you, they'll call you.

08:12.002 --> 08:15.103
You don't have to be Superwoman right now.

08:15.171 --> 08:17.206
You just have to be Supermom.

08:23.112 --> 08:26.615
Your junk is a lot classier than Toby's.

08:26.683 --> 08:28.617
Thanks. Do you think?

08:28.685 --> 08:30.786
I think he should read an
interior decorator's mind

08:30.854 --> 08:32.787
from time to time, you know? Get some tips.

08:32.856 --> 08:35.957
- Well, I like his taste.
- Yeah, but you have to say that.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.626
- And you don't?
- No. As his good buddy,

08:38.660 --> 08:41.864
it's my sworn duty to bust
his cojones any chance I get.

08:41.931 --> 08:46.134
- Oh. Well, I'm glad I made the cut, then.
- You know, where is this guy?

08:46.169 --> 08:49.136
I'm supposed to be here helping
you. Here I am doing all the work.

08:51.039 --> 08:52.741
A child did this?

08:56.712 --> 08:58.212
You guys have been busy.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.281
You suggested we all do dinner
and you're the one who's late.

09:00.315 --> 09:02.283
Right, yeah, ok. I'm sorry.

09:02.317 --> 09:03.818
I just, um...

09:03.853 --> 09:06.287
A homicide came up.

09:06.321 --> 09:08.856
Actually, something kinda creepy, so...

09:08.891 --> 09:11.859
Oh, my God. You pulled
the Serpent Murder case.

09:11.894 --> 09:14.828
Is that true? Jeez, it's like
a house full of mind readers.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.864
We don't know if it's connected.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.023
I remember it now. It
was an IIB case, right?

09:18.024 --> 09:19.510
Yeah, Michelle made the bust.

09:20.335 --> 09:23.670
Jeez, and now with this new murder, they're
gonna put her whole case under a microscope.

09:23.705 --> 09:25.305
You think it's the same guy?

09:25.339 --> 09:27.340
Some of the details are
the same, but there are

09:27.375 --> 09:31.412
inconsistencies, like, um, the first three
victims were all patients of this guy Murley,

09:31.446 --> 09:34.415
the one Michelle brought
down, but this new one wasn't.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.483
- Do you have any theories?
- Could be a copycat.

09:36.518 --> 09:40.153
Someone inspired by his infamy.
Michelle should be on this case.

09:40.187 --> 09:42.588
You know what? That's a tomorrow problem.

09:42.623 --> 09:47.060
For now, you just need to worry about getting
some dinner going so that somebody doesn't starve.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.262
- Thank you.
- Ok,

09:49.297 --> 09:51.606
starvation is not on the menu
tonight. Steaks, however, are.

09:51.607 --> 09:53.050
I'll put 'em on the grill, stat.

09:56.202 --> 09:59.138
Another call from Command came in a few
minutes ago. I told them you were in the field.

09:59.172 --> 10:00.470
That's the third call this morning.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.275
I'm trying to dodge them until
I can feed them some good news.

10:03.343 --> 10:06.643
Hey, Dev, you got any more info
on the pet food used for the rats?

10:07.345 --> 10:09.551
Yeah, I found out that it's sold
in over 50 stores around the city.

10:09.556 --> 10:12.284
And if this guy is as
smart as we assume he is,

10:12.319 --> 10:14.727
then they'll have moved around
and kept the buys low key.

10:14.736 --> 10:17.058
Yeah, we still haven't been
able to make a connection

10:17.059 --> 10:18.770
between Samuel Murley and the victim.

10:18.781 --> 10:20.960
According to the husband,
she wouldn't even think about

10:21.027 --> 10:22.084
getting plastic surgery.

10:22.085 --> 10:24.444
What about the surveillance
logs from the office building?

10:24.531 --> 10:27.266
The killer went in through a service
door, went up the fire stairs,

10:27.270 --> 10:31.135
- so there's no video and no fingerprints.
- So we're flying blind.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.604
Yeah.

10:32.672 --> 10:34.906
- Hey! Hi!
- Maybe not.

10:44.649 --> 10:46.717
This is an unexpected surprise.

10:46.785 --> 10:48.786
I'm back on the Murley case.

10:48.854 --> 10:50.955
I don't think that's a good idea.

10:51.023 --> 10:53.324
- Why is that?
- I think if you handle

10:53.342 --> 10:55.410
the case, it might be perceived
that we're covering our asses

10:55.477 --> 10:58.846
rather than launching a fresh
investigation into a homicide.

10:58.914 --> 11:02.149
There are people who will leverage this to
get Murley a new trial, and I'm not gonna

11:02.216 --> 11:04.752
let him out on the street to kill again.

11:04.820 --> 11:08.689
This is her case. If she wants
back on it, I'm all for it.

11:08.757 --> 11:10.691
Where would you start?

11:10.759 --> 11:14.127
First, I need someone to fill me
in, and then we go talk to Murley.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.063
You think he'd actually help us?

11:16.130 --> 11:18.265
No, but with Toby, that
might not be so important.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.327
You know, my guess is,

11:19.328 --> 11:21.738
he's in communication with whoever
picked up where he left off.

11:24.105 --> 11:25.705
Tread lightly.

11:25.773 --> 11:27.540
This case is a minefield.

11:27.575 --> 11:30.643
- Ok.
- Welcome back.

11:30.711 --> 11:35.114
Not quite the way I expected it, but, uh...

11:35.148 --> 11:37.484
Will you contact the prison and
let them know we're on our way?

11:37.551 --> 11:40.252
- So, we're on the road?
- Let's go.

11:56.636 --> 11:58.204
Michelle.

12:00.374 --> 12:01.840
I've kept up on you.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.942
Congratulations on your new baby.

12:06.980 --> 12:10.115
Well, I assume you feel you
haven't taken enough from me,

12:10.149 --> 12:12.450
so what else have you come to collect?

12:12.485 --> 12:14.920
We're investigating a murder very
similar to the ones that you committed.

12:14.954 --> 12:17.088
You say I committed.

12:17.123 --> 12:19.525
What has your partner told you about me?

12:19.559 --> 12:22.193
That I'm a monster, that I'm
psychotic, that I butchered people?

12:22.228 --> 12:24.496
She found proof that you're a murderer.

12:24.530 --> 12:27.298
Because I happen to have met
those three women that died?

12:27.333 --> 12:30.768
- Well, there was also snakes in your house, your car was...
- I've always had snakes.

12:30.802 --> 12:34.105
My father was a herpetologist.
Did that make him a killer too?

12:34.173 --> 12:36.141
Did your partner tell you
that they were different kinds

12:36.175 --> 12:38.343
of snakes than the ones
found with those women?

12:38.377 --> 12:41.378
I had nothing against them.

12:41.413 --> 12:44.982
I'm a physician. I wanted nothing
more than to help my patients.

12:51.056 --> 12:53.024
But it was the ones

12:53.091 --> 12:56.560
who didn't want your help that you killed.

12:56.594 --> 13:00.330
- Janice, Paula, Marta.
- I tried to help them, and they didn't want it.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.332
That's not something I can control.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.068
Why is she doing this to me?

13:04.102 --> 13:06.103
Everything I did for them.

13:06.171 --> 13:09.673
Have you been in contact with anyone
who'd want to commit more murders?

13:09.707 --> 13:12.008
Do you think I'm trying to convince
someone to kill innocent people?

13:12.076 --> 13:14.611
The prison says that you
get an awful lot of fan mail.

13:14.679 --> 13:16.613
I see.

13:16.681 --> 13:19.549
You believe that one of these

13:19.617 --> 13:22.485
might have done this new murder,
and you think I can help you.

13:22.553 --> 13:24.721
Well, if they did the original murders,

13:24.789 --> 13:26.957
you could help us prove your own innocence.

13:26.991 --> 13:29.858
- Their letters disgust me.
- Were there any from somebody

13:29.893 --> 13:32.195
you believe capable of committing murder?

13:32.262 --> 13:35.098
I have no idea. I threw all
those letters out, unread.

13:35.165 --> 13:37.400
To love someone for
killing. God, that's so...

13:37.468 --> 13:40.703
so misguided. Who would do that?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.905
Mr. Murley,

13:42.939 --> 13:45.107
if anything comes to you,

13:45.174 --> 13:47.943
you get the prison to contact us.

13:48.011 --> 13:50.079
If we can find proof of your innocence,

13:50.146 --> 13:52.014
we'll work to set you free.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.550
I wonder if your partner
feels the same way.

13:59.455 --> 14:02.557
- You're a beautiful woman.
- Excuse me?

14:04.527 --> 14:07.162
You're a beautiful woman.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.237
One day soon, my innocence will be proven,

14:15.304 --> 14:17.405
and I'll be back at work.

14:17.473 --> 14:20.374
The Buddha says, the best
way to overcome ill will

14:20.442 --> 14:24.245
is to present a gift to one's rival.

14:24.312 --> 14:28.916
So, to show you I have no bad feelings...

14:28.984 --> 14:31.919
I'd love to offer my services.

14:31.987 --> 14:34.022
With some work, you'd be perfection.

14:38.793 --> 14:41.462
I'll work with what I have, thanks.

14:41.496 --> 14:43.063
Get him out of here.

14:51.973 --> 14:54.875
Tell me you got something.

14:54.909 --> 14:58.478
He seemed disgusted with the
idea of someone being a groupie.

14:58.546 --> 15:00.714
Ok, then we're just not
asking the right questions.

15:00.782 --> 15:02.883
Look, he's guilty, ok?
And he knows something

15:02.917 --> 15:05.952
- about how did this latest...
- Honestly, Michelle, you know what?

15:05.987 --> 15:09.656
From what I read, I'm not so sure that
he did the original murders either.

15:17.473 --> 15:19.441
I'm telling you, Murley is guilty.

15:19.475 --> 15:22.077
No, I read he considered himself innocent.

15:22.111 --> 15:24.079
Yeah, but if his thinking
is disordered, you could have

15:24.113 --> 15:26.915
just as easily seen the sky being green.

15:26.949 --> 15:29.117
Michelle, or he could be innocent.

15:29.151 --> 15:32.120
At the time of his arrest, he passed
a polygraph test with flying colours.

15:32.154 --> 15:33.846
Yeah, as do half of the true psychotics,

15:33.847 --> 15:34.847
because they can control their emotions.

15:35.157 --> 15:37.092
Look, where are you going with this, Toby?

15:37.159 --> 15:39.194
Do you want to open up my
original investigation too?

15:39.228 --> 15:41.129
I'm saying, whoever did the new killing

15:41.163 --> 15:43.998
followed details that were
never released to the media.

15:44.066 --> 15:46.267
And we've got to be open
to the fact that maybe

15:46.301 --> 15:48.402
the original killer is still out there.

15:48.470 --> 15:50.872
Look, my case against Murley was solid.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.873
He knew the women, he
wrote letters to them,

15:52.941 --> 15:55.710
asking them to reconsider
letting him do the surgery.

15:55.744 --> 15:57.612
He kept snakes.

15:57.646 --> 15:59.714
His car was found close to the
scene of one of the murders.

15:59.781 --> 16:01.415
This is a different killer.

16:01.483 --> 16:03.417
Michelle, I read him. I read him thinking

16:03.485 --> 16:05.786
he doesn't communicate
with murder groupies.

16:05.820 --> 16:07.788
Well, then he talked to someone else...

16:07.822 --> 16:10.858
someone he didn't even know he
was giving the information to.

16:19.934 --> 16:22.335
Here's a list of the visitors
he's had since he's been in.

16:22.370 --> 16:24.337
There haven't been many.

16:24.405 --> 16:27.807
- So, what, he's had his visitations restricted?
- No.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.809
There's a lot of people
who want to talk to him...

16:29.877 --> 16:32.712
reporters, TV people. He just
doesn't want to see any of them.

16:32.780 --> 16:36.082
There's a number of visits here from
Ken Pelc from the Freedom Project.

16:36.116 --> 16:39.519
Yeah, they've been fighting
for him since he went inside.

16:39.553 --> 16:42.054
- What about his cellmates?
- Dr. Murley's had

16:42.122 --> 16:44.190
one cellmate for most of his time inside...

16:44.224 --> 16:48.194
a badass ex-biker named Noah
Barnes, in for manslaughter.

16:48.262 --> 16:50.396
Well, we'd like to see Noah Barnes, please.

16:50.463 --> 16:53.099
You'll have to look him up on your
own. He got out three weeks ago.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.500
Thank you.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.336
- Ok. If you'll excuse me.
- Yeah.

17:00.072 --> 17:03.342
So, if this Noah Barnes
guy has killed before,

17:03.376 --> 17:05.511
could he be out there
killing to free his buddy?

17:05.545 --> 17:07.512
They had nothing but
time in here to plan it,

17:07.547 --> 17:10.516
so he's been out long enough to
source the snakes and the victim.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.718
Let's see if Dev can get us an address.

17:18.089 --> 17:21.193
- Is Klein in?
- Oh. Uh, actually,

17:21.260 --> 17:23.594
he said he had a meeting,
which is probably a good thing,

17:23.662 --> 17:26.097
'cause the superintendent's been
calling like every 30 minutes.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.098
I mean, this Murley
case is just blowing up.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.101
Did you check in to Murley's cellmate?

17:30.136 --> 17:33.070
Actually, Barnes went off
his parole officer's radar,

17:33.104 --> 17:35.072
but I managed to dig up one of his friends,

17:35.106 --> 17:37.074
who told me that Barnes
was staying with his sister

17:37.108 --> 17:39.477
at a place just off Carlaw.
I'll text you the address.

17:39.511 --> 17:41.145
Let's go talk to him.

17:41.179 --> 17:43.448
Then I want to talk to
whomever's in charge.

17:43.482 --> 17:45.916
Sergeant McCluskey. Can I help you?

17:45.951 --> 17:48.414
I know who you are, Sergeant.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.369
I'm Ken Pelc, director
of the Freedom Project.

17:51.422 --> 17:54.125
This is Lucy Carnevale, our legal intern.

17:54.159 --> 17:56.660
Yes, I followed your work.
Your advocacy has helped

17:56.694 --> 17:59.997
many people, and helped direct the
investigation towards finding the real killer.

18:00.031 --> 18:02.233
I didn't come here to be praised, Sergeant.

18:02.267 --> 18:04.029
I got a call from Samuel Murley.

18:04.030 --> 18:06.419
You've just been at the prison
attempting to implicate him

18:06.420 --> 18:07.947
- in this fresh murder.
- Why don't we continue

18:07.948 --> 18:10.099
this conversation in our conference room?

18:12.209 --> 18:14.378
We went to visit Dr.
Murley because we believe

18:14.412 --> 18:16.580
he may have some insight
as to who the killer is.

18:16.614 --> 18:21.084
Dr. Murley had no idea who the Serpent
Killer was three years ago, and he has

18:21.118 --> 18:23.086
no idea of who they are now.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.721
You should understand that we are currently

18:25.756 --> 18:28.758
preparing fresh legal
action against the IIB

18:28.793 --> 18:30.260
and you personally

18:30.294 --> 18:32.862
for false arrest and malicious prosecution.

18:32.897 --> 18:35.331
Malicious prosecution demands
that there must be an absence

18:35.365 --> 18:37.933
of probable cause at the
time of the officer's arrest.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.369
We did our job, and we did it well.

18:40.404 --> 18:42.500
Guilt was proven to the
satisfaction of the court.

18:42.505 --> 18:45.775
That guilt was based on
circumstantial evidence.

18:45.809 --> 18:48.010
A murder weapon was never presented.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.512
He's an innocent man.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.214
Of course, any help the IIB could provide

18:52.248 --> 18:54.582
in effecting Dr. Murley's release will be

18:54.650 --> 18:57.219
taken into account as
we proceed in our suits.

18:57.253 --> 19:00.655
Yes, I know how you would take
our cooperation as an admission

19:00.690 --> 19:03.258
of false arrest. No, we
are not in the business

19:03.293 --> 19:05.260
of freeing the guilty, so
you're gonna have to carry out

19:05.295 --> 19:07.462
this crusade of yours on your own.

19:16.605 --> 19:19.073
Pelc finds out we're
talking to Murley's friends,

19:19.107 --> 19:21.376
he's gonna have a field day with us.

19:21.444 --> 19:24.412
All the more reason to get this
dealt with as quickly as possible.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.013
Yes.

19:39.394 --> 19:42.463
- Noah Barnes?
- Don't tell me. You're cops.

19:42.497 --> 19:45.432
Ah, you're perceptive. Maybe you
can tell us what we're doing here.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.435
Since when do you need an excuse to
hassle somebody who's been inside?

19:48.503 --> 19:50.804
You were cellmates with
Samuel Murley, right?

19:50.872 --> 19:53.273
- You two were pretty close?
- He was a solid guy.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.843
- Didn't belong in there.
- Yeah? Is that why you tried to help him get out?

19:55.910 --> 19:57.678
- What?
- Where'd you put the gun, Noah?

19:57.712 --> 19:59.946
I don't know anything about any gun.

20:00.014 --> 20:03.250
- I gotta get rid of it.
- That's not true, is it?

20:03.317 --> 20:04.817
You're crazy.

20:04.852 --> 20:06.319
I got somewhere to be.

20:06.387 --> 20:09.622
No, you have to be where we tell you to be.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.124
Yeah.

20:11.192 --> 20:13.293
Look what we got here.

20:13.361 --> 20:15.561
And that would be under arrest.

20:19.024 --> 20:21.526
I didn't even know that the gun was there.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.528
That's gonna be pretty tough
to sell once the lab results

20:24.562 --> 20:26.530
come back with your prints all over it.

20:26.564 --> 20:29.133
Out of prison for three weeks
and you're already in possession

20:29.167 --> 20:31.936
of an illegal weapon. That
alone will put you back in prison

20:31.970 --> 20:33.437
for a few years.

20:33.471 --> 20:35.505
- What do you want from me?
- We want to know about

20:35.573 --> 20:38.242
- your deal with Murley.
- I told you I didn't make any deal.

20:38.276 --> 20:41.044
He needed someone to make it look like
the real killer was still out there.

20:41.078 --> 20:43.112
Think I'd kill somebody for him?

20:43.180 --> 20:45.949
Crazy. Get out of my life.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.218
He was a good guy.

20:48.252 --> 20:50.454
Spiritual.

20:50.488 --> 20:52.823
He wouldn't have killed
the people they said he did,

20:52.857 --> 20:55.491
and I sure as hell wouldn't
have killed anyone for him.

20:55.525 --> 20:58.094
We know that he told
you where he hid the gun.

20:58.128 --> 21:00.864
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:10.274 --> 21:11.907
All right, so,

21:11.941 --> 21:14.343
you want us to believe that
you're not working with Murley.

21:14.378 --> 21:17.580
Fine. What prisoners was he close to?

21:17.614 --> 21:19.715
None. He kept to himself.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.717
No, there must have been someone.

21:21.752 --> 21:24.754
You want to take a look at people
that were jammed up with Murley?

21:24.788 --> 21:27.390
Take a look at the head guard, Halloran.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.925
Halloran was real close with Murley.

21:29.959 --> 21:31.960
He used to sneak stuff in for him.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.835
Barnes was shocked that we
thought he would kill for Murley.

21:40.870 --> 21:43.805
- What about the gun?
- Ah, he got it from a biker.

21:43.839 --> 21:45.912
My bet is ballistics will
prove it's not our weapon.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.110
You read Murley thinking

21:47.119 --> 21:49.277
he wouldn't get someone to murder for him

21:49.311 --> 21:51.312
and his cellmate thinking he was innocent.

21:51.346 --> 21:52.673
Maybe it was someone who
did it without being asked,

21:52.674 --> 21:54.075
someone that Murley didn't even know.

21:54.216 --> 21:57.419
Who happened to know unpublished details
of the case, like the brand of dog food?

21:57.486 --> 21:59.168
Well, if Halloran is
sneaking things in for Murley,

21:59.169 --> 22:01.021
maybe he's sneaking information out too.

22:01.323 --> 22:04.292
- You really think a guard would broker a hit?
- Anything is possible.

22:04.359 --> 22:06.727
Murley seems to have everyone he
needs under some kind of spell.

22:06.795 --> 22:08.729
If Halloran is a big
enough fan, he could have

22:08.797 --> 22:11.332
even done it himself. I think
we should get him in here.

22:11.366 --> 22:13.796
Look, you asked me to come in, I came in,

22:13.799 --> 22:18.038
- but I want to know what this is all about.
- You lied to us about who helped Murley.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.340
- What do you mean?
- You were helping him.

22:20.408 --> 22:23.043
You smuggled things in for him. No.

22:31.385 --> 22:33.620
We know about the cell phone.

22:37.124 --> 22:39.225
Look...

22:39.293 --> 22:40.726
Murley's a good guy.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.796
Who killed three women.
You have one chance here

22:43.831 --> 22:46.366
of keeping your job, Mr. Halloran.

22:46.434 --> 22:48.634
Tell us the truth.

22:50.604 --> 22:52.972
He said he didn't do it. I believe him.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.075
Yeah, so it's ok then?

22:56.109 --> 22:58.644
He helped me.

22:58.712 --> 23:02.147
He gave me some medical
advice when my wife was sick.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.484
I told him what she was complaining about,

23:04.518 --> 23:08.220
and he figured out it was cancer
even before her doctor spotted it.

23:08.288 --> 23:11.190
- He saved her life.
- Right, so you owed him.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.192
Did you go as far as killing for him?

23:13.259 --> 23:15.127
No. No.

23:15.195 --> 23:18.030
Sam's no killer. You're
gonna try and blame me.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.932
- Never hurt anyone.
- All right, so all you did was

23:20.967 --> 23:23.502
get him his cell phone. Who paid for it?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.507
The people at the Freedom
Project gave it to me.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.876
Who?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.111
Mr. Pelc.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.614
I know that Murley's a
high-profile case for Pelc,

23:35.648 --> 23:37.616
but do we really think he's a killer?

23:37.650 --> 23:40.451
- It's worth looking into.
- Yeah, well, in the meantime,

23:40.486 --> 23:43.121
Pelc got to a judge. They're
reopening Murley's case.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.123
- No, they can't do that.
- They can and they will,

23:45.157 --> 23:47.791
and the only support we're gonna
get from the IIB is throwing you

23:47.826 --> 23:49.793
and the rest of the unit under the bus.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.796
Come on. With Michelle's record,
this is the thanks they give her?

23:52.864 --> 23:54.798
No, this is how they cover their asses.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.800
We need to clean this up quickly.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.802
The first thing we need to do
is find out what Murley told

23:58.837 --> 24:02.372
Pelc, and more importantly,
what Pelc did for him.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.545
I'm looking for Mr. Pelc.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.314
Thank you.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.752
Sergeant McCluskey.

24:15.786 --> 24:18.922
If you've come here to try to intimidate us

24:18.956 --> 24:20.823
into stopping our campaign

24:20.858 --> 24:22.926
to free Samuel Murley,
you're wasting your time.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.794
We know you snuck a phone into the prison.

24:24.828 --> 24:27.797
- Ken, this interview is over.
- We have testimony from the guard

24:27.831 --> 24:29.766
who helped you, so we can carry on here,

24:29.800 --> 24:31.668
or down at our office, whatever you prefer.

24:31.702 --> 24:34.604
The man's cut off in there.
If we're gonna help him,

24:34.638 --> 24:36.940
we need access to coordinate our strategy.

24:36.974 --> 24:38.908
Yeah, would that strategy
involve killing an innocent

24:38.943 --> 24:40.910
person to cast doubt on Murley's guilt?

24:40.945 --> 24:43.312
Do you know how insane that sounds?

24:43.346 --> 24:47.616
This organization represents
scores of falsely accused inmates.

24:47.684 --> 24:50.186
If I were to commit crimes
to get all of them out,

24:50.220 --> 24:52.521
I'd be the biggest mass
murderer in history.

24:52.556 --> 24:55.657
Insane! Grasping at straws.

24:55.692 --> 24:58.360
I'm afraid any further communication

24:58.395 --> 25:00.796
will have to be conducted
through Miss Carnevale.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.865
I trust you'll make a
note of their accusations.

25:06.502 --> 25:09.838
Well, the IIB is certainly
making our job easier.

25:12.909 --> 25:15.010
Please tell me you got something.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.945
I think he's telling the truth.

25:16.980 --> 25:20.215
- All right, let's head back to the office...
- Let's call it a day, Michelle.

25:20.282 --> 25:22.783
- I think the bad guys can wait.
- Ok.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.523
You know, I am sorta getting
used to living out of boxes.

25:28.591 --> 25:31.859
It's kinda romantic. Well, there
would be a hell of a lot more romance

25:31.893 --> 25:34.496
if we could find a clear
path to the bedroom.

25:34.563 --> 25:37.031
Lot to be said for unpacking.

25:37.099 --> 25:40.001
So, how's Michelle doing?

25:40.035 --> 25:43.104
It's one hell of a way for
her to return to the job.

25:43.171 --> 25:45.405
Can we go off the record?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.708
Reporter mode: disabled.

25:47.776 --> 25:51.512
Look, all the evidence we're finding,

25:51.546 --> 25:53.547
it looks more and more
like Murley never did it.

25:53.615 --> 25:56.316
The brass is looking to
throw her under the bus.

25:56.384 --> 25:58.318
Yep, that doesn't surprise me.

25:58.386 --> 26:00.320
Organizations protect the organization

26:00.388 --> 26:02.992
ahead of its members, no matter
how honourable the member is.

26:03.158 --> 26:06.893
Yeah, well, it's making me rethink my
ideas about loyalty, that's for sure.

26:06.961 --> 26:09.529
But you were inside his head
and you didn't read any guilt.

26:09.596 --> 26:12.431
It's great that you're
loyal to your partner,

26:12.466 --> 26:15.501
but there's a chance Murley
really might not have done it.

26:15.569 --> 26:17.460
Look, she brought me into the
unit. If they're gonna burn her,

26:17.461 --> 26:18.811
I can't see myself staying.

26:21.575 --> 26:23.543
You know what?

26:23.577 --> 26:26.045
- That's tomorrow's problem.
- Are we done?

26:26.112 --> 26:28.614
- Yeah.
- Good.

26:28.649 --> 26:30.916
The only problem we have
now is finding that path

26:30.950 --> 26:33.386
- to the bed.
- Hey,

26:33.420 --> 26:36.789
- what makes you think we'll get there?
- Oh, hey.

26:36.823 --> 26:39.091
- Hey.
- Sorry to interrupt.

26:39.159 --> 26:41.126
I, uh, had to go out
and get some wall filler.

26:41.161 --> 26:44.129
- Wall filler?
- Yeah, yeah, I was putting up a painting upstairs,

26:44.164 --> 26:46.699
and I, uh... kinda made a mistake.

26:46.733 --> 26:47.290
You made a hole?

26:47.291 --> 26:49.502
Well, I don't know at what point it
technically qualifies as a window,

26:49.602 --> 26:51.570
but, hey, nothing I can't fix

26:51.604 --> 26:55.074
with some wall filler and a lot of paint.

26:55.108 --> 26:57.442
I'll be right back.

26:57.476 --> 27:00.378
Mr. Fox?

27:00.413 --> 27:02.714
No? Ok, how about...

27:02.748 --> 27:04.316
how about your bottle?

27:04.350 --> 27:06.818
Are you hungry? No?

27:06.852 --> 27:09.321
Ok, ok, all right, it's ok.

27:09.355 --> 27:11.923
- Just talk to me.
- She's not buying it, huh?

27:11.957 --> 27:13.925
- You want to see Daddy?
- Yeah, let me give it a try.

27:13.959 --> 27:17.161
Come here, you. What's up,
babes? What's up? What's up?

27:17.196 --> 27:19.163
You just want to look around,

27:19.198 --> 27:21.498
right? Yeah, you want to go to the park

27:21.533 --> 27:24.102
or something? Hmm? Are
you giving Mom a hard time?

27:24.136 --> 27:27.304
Hmm? Look, Mom's under a lot of stress.

27:27.339 --> 27:28.773
It's gonna be ok, babe.

27:28.807 --> 27:30.241
You got the right guy.

27:30.308 --> 27:32.809
Even my partners aren't
sure of that right now.

27:32.844 --> 27:36.913
You know, if Murley gets
out, my career is over.

27:36.948 --> 27:39.450
- They're not gonna fire you.
- No, worse. They'll put me

27:39.484 --> 27:42.319
at some desk job with low-priority cases.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.655
That's how they deal
with their dirty laundry.

27:44.689 --> 27:46.890
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad thing, huh?

27:46.958 --> 27:49.726
Get you off the front lines,
keep you at home a little bit.

27:51.695 --> 27:54.765
I've worked for 10
years to build my career.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.667
I can't just...

27:57.701 --> 27:59.770
throw it away like that.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.538
Ohhh.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.309
We're here for you, babe.

28:13.917 --> 28:16.185
Hey. Any news?

28:16.219 --> 28:18.187
I keep ducking calls from Command,

28:18.221 --> 28:20.956
but this isn't going away.
If Sandra Perry was targeted

28:21.024 --> 28:22.958
for a reason, we need to know what it is.

28:23.026 --> 28:26.461
We still have no idea if or when
this killer is gonna strike again.

28:26.529 --> 28:28.697
Uh, guys, I think I came up with something.

28:28.765 --> 28:31.500
Unfortunately, Michelle,
you might not like this.

28:33.436 --> 28:35.171
I've been checking connections

28:35.238 --> 28:37.506
of the three previous
victims and Sandra Perry.

28:37.573 --> 28:39.012
When I ran the credit card purchases,

28:39.013 --> 28:41.600
I found that they were all clients
of a place called Calla Spa,

28:41.626 --> 28:44.846
and all four of them were getting
treatments from the same man,

28:44.914 --> 28:47.516
Terrence Fellows. He's the owner.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.095
But if he's been out there
for the last three years,

28:49.096 --> 28:50.806
why would he start killing again now?

28:51.053 --> 28:53.588
That's what we're gonna
find out. Toby, Dev,

28:53.656 --> 28:55.857
you go pick him up. I'll
arrange for a search warrant.

28:55.925 --> 28:58.860
- What do you want me to do?
- You go home.

28:58.928 --> 29:01.296
- What?
- You're off the case for now.

29:01.363 --> 29:03.531
Continue with your mat leave
like you originally planned.

29:03.598 --> 29:05.533
Hey, hold it. What are you doing here?

29:05.600 --> 29:07.535
Pressure from the Freedom Project

29:07.602 --> 29:08.717
is bringing down too much heat,

29:08.718 --> 29:10.469
and you're a little too
close to this right now.

29:10.972 --> 29:12.906
I was afraid the bosses would shut me down

29:12.974 --> 29:15.676
to cover their asses, but I
never expected it from you.

29:15.711 --> 29:18.212
Sorry.

29:21.650 --> 29:25.152
- We'll fight this, Michelle.
- What if he's right?

29:28.456 --> 29:29.990
Let's go.

29:44.025 --> 29:46.026
Excuse me. IIB. Who's in charge here?

29:46.060 --> 29:48.763
Welcome to Calla Spa,
gentlemen. How can I help you?

29:48.830 --> 29:50.297
- Yeah, you in charge?
- Yes, I am.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.799
We've got a few questions for
you about some of your clients.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.835
Wow, I hope nobody went on a crime
spree. Who are you interested in?

29:55.870 --> 29:58.882
- Sandra Perry is one of them.
- Oh, I heard what happened. I'm so sorry.

29:58.886 --> 30:01.469
She was a nice woman. But I'm
not sure how I can help you.

30:01.470 --> 30:03.158
You can tell us about
your relationship with her

30:03.160 --> 30:04.500
and the three other clients of yours

30:04.501 --> 30:05.861
who were murdered over the past few years.

30:06.794 --> 30:09.395
Are you accusing me of something?

30:09.429 --> 30:11.397
Well, seeing as we just
found this in your car,

30:11.431 --> 30:13.699
- I'm afraid we are.
- I don't have a gun.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.802
Let's go on back for a chat.

30:17.437 --> 30:19.572
Come on.

30:19.607 --> 30:21.073
We found the gun in your car.

30:21.108 --> 30:23.075
What's gonna happen when
ballistics comes back and says

30:23.110 --> 30:25.644
it's the same weapon
used in all four murders?

30:25.678 --> 30:27.713
Did they plant it? Did someone else?

30:27.747 --> 30:29.281
Who'd do this to me?

30:29.316 --> 30:32.084
Come on, you didn't find it
odd that three of your clients

30:32.119 --> 30:34.653
were killed within a
space of a couple months?

30:34.687 --> 30:37.423
Hold on. When was I supposed
to have committed this murder?

30:37.457 --> 30:39.258
Between eight and 10 the night before last.

30:39.326 --> 30:42.060
Well, I was at an event with
a client the whole night,

30:42.094 --> 30:44.563
and I stayed at her
house. You can call her.

30:44.597 --> 30:47.666
All right. Give us her name and number.

30:49.969 --> 30:52.504
Can I talk to you?

30:55.808 --> 30:57.676
Ok, so, assuming Michelle's right

30:57.710 --> 30:59.777
and the new murder was done by a copycat,

30:59.811 --> 31:01.779
the new killer would have had to have
done the same research that we did,

31:01.813 --> 31:04.649
and found someone who was also
connected to the original Murley victims.

31:04.716 --> 31:06.684
Right, and then he picked a
random woman who was connected

31:06.718 --> 31:08.686
- only to Fellows.
- Ok, well, whoever they are,

31:08.720 --> 31:10.955
they're clearly focused on
their mission to get Murley out,

31:11.023 --> 31:14.792
so... unfortunately, that doesn't
help us get any closer to who they are.

31:14.860 --> 31:16.827
We gotta see Murley.

31:16.862 --> 31:18.328
I asked the guards

31:18.363 --> 31:20.242
to contact the Freedom Project
to let them know you're here.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.600
Oh, that's fine. We won't be here long.

31:22.668 --> 31:24.602
I told you I can't help
you, and that hasn't changed.

31:24.670 --> 31:27.738
But ask me anyway. What
must happen must happen.

31:27.806 --> 31:30.942
Everything will unfold as it is intended.

31:31.009 --> 31:32.387
I don't think you're gonna be so...

31:32.388 --> 31:34.333
zen when you hear what we have to tell you.

31:34.712 --> 31:37.614
You see, we found the murder weapon.

31:42.554 --> 31:44.488
You hid it inside the Buddha.

31:44.556 --> 31:47.524
The Buddha is about perfection, not death.

31:47.592 --> 31:49.525
Yeah, this is starting to make sense,

31:49.560 --> 31:52.361
'cause this isn't about you
claiming to be Buddhist, is it?

31:52.429 --> 31:55.665
See, we thought the snakes represented
revenge, but that's not it, is it?

31:55.700 --> 31:59.368
The serpent transforms, rebirths,

31:59.403 --> 32:01.972
- perfects itself.
- In your twisted mind,

32:02.039 --> 32:03.974
you actually believe that
you're helping these women,

32:04.041 --> 32:07.176
that you're perfecting
them, transforming them.

32:07.244 --> 32:10.413
I offered them beauty.

32:10.447 --> 32:12.281
They rejected it.

32:12.349 --> 32:14.550
I bore them no ill will.

32:14.618 --> 32:18.921
So, you wanted whoever killed
Sandra Perry to continue your work.

32:18.989 --> 32:21.023
Why are they doing this?
What about my things,

32:21.057 --> 32:23.258
- my Buddha?
- Don't worry, they're safe.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.427
Everything is safe.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.099
Dev.

32:33.970 --> 32:36.672
I think I know who had the gun,
and she might be our killer.

32:40.702 --> 32:42.669
Yeah, I read Murley again.
He still doesn't see himself

32:42.704 --> 32:45.338
as guilty, but I saw him with the gun.

32:45.372 --> 32:48.307
He had it hidden inside of
a Buddha. You were right.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.977
Ok, well, now we just need to prove
it. Uh, who had access to his things?

32:52.011 --> 32:54.447
- The Freedom Project people.
- Yeah, but you read Pelc

32:54.481 --> 32:58.150
- and felt that he was innocent.
- I did, but I also read Murley speaking to Pelc's legal intern

32:58.184 --> 33:02.354
Lucy Carnevale. She said that she
had his stuff and that it was safe.

33:02.388 --> 33:05.357
Do we buy a law student committing
murder to get her client off?

33:05.391 --> 33:06.992
Well, I think it might be more than that.

33:07.026 --> 33:09.627
I think she might be fan. I
pulled up her school records.

33:09.662 --> 33:13.031
In university, she was a legal
prodigy, specializing in serial killers.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.167
She even kept up correspondence
with a few of them.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.757
One of her professors noted that

33:16.758 --> 33:19.903
her fascination with serial
killers bordered on the morbid.

33:19.905 --> 33:23.040
So, why now, and why
does she choose Murley?

33:23.075 --> 33:26.143
Sometimes serial killers are just
waiting for a catalyst, right? Maybe...

33:26.211 --> 33:28.847
maybe Murley's insanity
is in tune with her own.

33:28.914 --> 33:31.883
Well, she'd been offered other
interning positions for much higher pay.

33:31.917 --> 33:33.885
I can only think that
maybe she took the position

33:33.919 --> 33:36.320
at Freedom Project just
to be closer to Murley.

33:36.355 --> 33:39.891
So, she's looking for a
partner, a mentor, a lover?

33:39.925 --> 33:43.027
- Maybe all of the above.
- Well, I checked with Pelc's office, and Lucy isn't in.

33:43.061 --> 33:44.862
But I did manage to get a home address,

33:44.930 --> 33:46.898
which I am texting to you as we speak.

33:46.932 --> 33:48.900
I also spoke to Klein
and secured a warrant.

33:48.934 --> 33:51.702
We don't want this one
getting off on a technicality.

33:51.770 --> 33:55.338
Michelle, this is your
case. You belong there.

33:55.373 --> 33:57.674
I'll meet you there.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.247
I have to go.

34:06.717 --> 34:08.385
But you be safe, ok?

34:08.418 --> 34:09.953
I will.

34:23.099 --> 34:25.266
Dev, you go left. Toby, take right.

34:25.335 --> 34:26.869
Ok.

35:18.854 --> 35:21.222
You ruined everything.

35:21.256 --> 35:24.959
Why is that? Because we found out
that you killed an innocent woman?

35:25.027 --> 35:26.961
Put your gun down.

35:27.029 --> 35:28.496
Put it down!

35:32.166 --> 35:34.201
Kick it away.

35:37.639 --> 35:40.774
You think you're so smart.
You're nothing compared to Samuel.

35:40.809 --> 35:43.811
Well, that's not really a
competition that I want to play in.

35:43.845 --> 35:48.781
You know in university I carried
around a murder kit that I made?

35:48.816 --> 35:51.118
Some knives,

35:51.152 --> 35:53.953
a hammer,

35:53.988 --> 35:56.289
duct tape,

35:56.324 --> 35:58.458
gloves,

35:58.493 --> 36:00.960
a mask.

36:00.995 --> 36:02.795
I tracked winos in alleys,

36:02.830 --> 36:04.898
but I never made my move.

36:06.834 --> 36:09.135
I studied killers, those
who had the strength

36:09.169 --> 36:11.404
to follow through on what they had to do.

36:11.438 --> 36:14.473
I... dreamed of being like them.

36:14.508 --> 36:18.344
Dr. Murley gave me the
inspiration to actually do it.

36:18.378 --> 36:20.446
Just put the gun down, Lucy.

36:22.382 --> 36:25.584
There's no walking out
of here, ok? It's over.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.420
But I have you.

36:27.454 --> 36:30.756
We'll walk out together,
and I'll let you live.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.758
You really think you can do that,

36:32.792 --> 36:36.728
after you've had a taste of what
it feels like to really kill?

36:36.763 --> 36:38.263
Maybe you are smart.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.199
Lucy.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.869
Don't do it. Don't do it.

36:43.903 --> 36:48.040
You die here, Murley will never
know what you did for him -

36:48.074 --> 36:49.474
how much you loved him.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.509
You have no idea.

36:51.577 --> 36:56.281
I understand his need for perfection.

36:56.348 --> 36:59.884
You understand his commitment

36:59.918 --> 37:03.088
to the spiritual aspect
of physical perfection.

37:03.122 --> 37:05.056
It's like you're inside his head.

37:05.124 --> 37:07.258
And that's why you knew
he'd still have a gun

37:07.293 --> 37:08.926
'cause there's work to do.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.895
But you couldn't share that
with him, because he threw your

37:10.929 --> 37:13.197
letters out like he did with
all the other murder groupies.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.400
- That's not what I am!
- It's not what you are. You're committed.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.569
That's why you volunteered

37:18.637 --> 37:21.038
for the Freedom Project so
you could be closer to him,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.574
so you could free him.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.542
You want to help continue his mission.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.811
It was splitting the
women's tongues that told me.

37:27.878 --> 37:31.348
Perfection, rebirth through
pain. Beauty through death. Pure.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.685
When I read the Buddhist myths of
the Nagas, the serpents, I understood.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.622
I wanted to be a part of his work.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.624
I wanted him to offer me
the gift of his beauty.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.626
Kill for him, kill with him, together.

37:42.660 --> 37:46.462
- I wouldn't reject him like they did.
- It's not too late. You guys could still be together.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.898
If I did here, they can
say I did all the killings.

37:48.966 --> 37:52.068
He can still be free.

37:52.136 --> 37:55.138
Don't make me shoot.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.473
Stay down! Don't move.

37:57.541 --> 38:00.510
Don't move.

38:29.605 --> 38:31.573
That was a nice move.

38:31.607 --> 38:34.075
A little rusty, but did the trick.

38:34.109 --> 38:35.677
Welcome back.

38:49.792 --> 38:52.626
Is it time? Have you come to release me?

38:52.661 --> 38:55.629
We caught the woman who
was copying your crimes.

38:55.664 --> 38:58.132
She worked for the Freedom Project.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.434
Then you caught your killer.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.103
She told us everything...

39:02.137 --> 39:05.706
Where you hid the gun, how she got it.

39:07.642 --> 39:09.476
Then why are you here?

39:09.511 --> 39:12.045
Because I wanted to look you
in the eyes when I told you

39:12.080 --> 39:14.381
that you are never getting out of here.

39:19.987 --> 39:22.622
I won't be in here forever, Michelle.

39:22.656 --> 39:25.458
And my offer still stands.

39:25.492 --> 39:28.128
I would love to work on you

39:28.162 --> 39:30.731
when I'm free.

39:54.788 --> 39:57.556
Pelc and the Freedom Project
have been strangely silent

39:57.624 --> 40:00.025
- for the last 24 hours.
- Well, I can't imagine

40:00.093 --> 40:02.027
they have too much to
say when it turned out

40:02.095 --> 40:04.563
that their lawyer was the
one who was the killer.

40:04.597 --> 40:07.767
She got herself put away, and she
cemented your case against Murley, though.

40:07.801 --> 40:09.568
You know, I have to admit,

40:09.636 --> 40:12.271
it was pretty smart, the
way that she figured out

40:12.338 --> 40:15.574
the secondary connections
to the spa and those women.

40:15.642 --> 40:17.576
I mean, she could have killed
any one of the spa's clients

40:17.644 --> 40:20.211
as a decoy. Sandra Perry was just unlucky.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.082
How are you? That was
one hell of a takedown.

40:24.116 --> 40:26.050
Yeah, I made my move out of instinct,

40:26.118 --> 40:28.052
but when she had that gun to
me, all I could think about was

40:28.120 --> 40:30.354
how Carrie was gonna grow up without a mom.

40:35.527 --> 40:37.461
Superintendent congratulating you?

40:37.529 --> 40:41.032
Not quite. The Commissioner
of National Security

40:41.100 --> 40:43.701
has just assigned me a
posting with Interpol.

40:43.735 --> 40:46.604
- Oh.
- What?

40:46.672 --> 40:48.739
You're not gonna take it, are you?

40:48.807 --> 40:51.609
I tried to decline, but
apparently that's not an option.

40:51.677 --> 40:56.246
They have committed my services to
the Paris office. I leave in five days.

40:56.281 --> 40:58.316
For how long?

40:58.383 --> 41:01.819
I don't know.

41:01.886 --> 41:03.987
For what it's worth, I've suggested

41:04.055 --> 41:06.290
that you'd make a great
candidate to lead the team.

41:06.324 --> 41:07.791
I... I mean,

41:07.826 --> 41:09.993
I'm just getting used
to being back at work.

41:10.028 --> 41:12.562
Oh, come on. You know you want it.

41:12.630 --> 41:14.898
I would make a great boss.

41:14.933 --> 41:17.634
So, where does that leave
us? Where do we go from here?

41:17.668 --> 41:20.537
In the short term, I'm
gonna search out a bar,

41:20.571 --> 41:23.072
and anyone is welcome
to join me if they care.

41:23.106 --> 41:26.075
I can do one drink and then
I have to put a baby to bed.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.777
One drink. Babies to bed.

41:27.812 --> 41:29.979
- Let's go.
- All right, let's do this.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.084
Hey.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.053
Mm, hey.

41:39.823 --> 41:41.790
How did it go?

41:41.825 --> 41:43.759
We got the bad guys.

41:46.897 --> 41:48.864
And now you're home.

41:48.898 --> 41:50.966
Now I'm home.

41:58.341 --> 42:00.409
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:04.848 --> 42:07.815
So, I heard about Lucy Carnevale
being arrested for the Perry murder.

42:07.850 --> 42:11.953
Yes. Yes, even serial
killers have their fans, huh?

42:13.890 --> 42:15.857
- And Michelle's ok?
- Yeah.

42:15.892 --> 42:17.859
She came through like a pro.

42:17.894 --> 42:19.861
It might take her a little while

42:19.896 --> 42:22.196
to get adjusted to being back, but...

42:22.230 --> 42:24.031
good to have her back.

42:25.967 --> 42:28.770
You read my mind.

42:28.804 --> 42:32.273
That is a curse I would
not... be able to live with.

42:32.307 --> 42:34.174
Tell me about it.
