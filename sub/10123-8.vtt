WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:01.700
HEY, CORY.

00:01.700 --> 00:04.600
BROUGHT YOU A GREAT
ARTICLE ON BARRY BONDS.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.734
AH, THE $43-MILLION MAN.

00:07.734 --> 00:08.967
WHY DO THEY
CALL HIM THAT?

00:08.967 --> 00:10.200
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
HE'S GETTING PAID

00:10.200 --> 00:11.867
TO PLAY BASEBALL
FOR 6 YEARS.

00:11.867 --> 00:14.200
7.16 MILLION A YEAR?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.967
IF THAT'S WHAT IT
COMES OUT TO, YEAH.

00:16.967 --> 00:20.033
HE HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF
THE TOP GUYS IN BASEBALL.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.033
WELL, I HAPPEN TO
THINK MR. FEENY IS

00:22.033 --> 00:23.667
ONE OF THE TOP GUYS
IN TEACHING,

00:23.667 --> 00:26.800
AND HE MAKES ABOUT
40,000 A YEAR.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.200
THAT STINKS.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.400
FINALLY.
SOMETHING WE AGREE ON.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.467
YEAH.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.600
FEENY AIN'T WORTH
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.400
YOU THOUGHT I MEANT
HE WAS OVERPAID?

00:37.400 --> 00:39.100
I MEANT THAT MR. FEENY

00:39.100 --> 00:41.767
IS GROSSLY AND
TRAGICALLY UNDERPAID.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.767
MINKUS--MAY I
CALL YOU MINKUS?

00:43.767 --> 00:45.700
DOES SPELLING
EVER CHANGE? NO.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.233
DOES HISTORY
EVER CHANGE? UH-UH.

00:48.233 --> 00:50.300
DOES FEENY EVER
CHANGE? NEVER.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.367
KNOW WHY?
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.200
KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE NOTHING ABOUT

00:54.200 --> 00:56.400
TEACHING SIXTH GRADE
EVER CHANGES.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.867
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:57.867 --> 00:59.200
WELL, I THINK I'M RIGHT.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.500
I THINK IN ABOUT
5 SECONDS,

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
FEENY WALKS IN HERE,

01:01.500 --> 01:03.233
TAKES A SIP FROM
THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN,

01:03.233 --> 01:05.934
FLICKS HIS MUSTACHE,
GOES TO THE COFFEE MACHINE,

01:05.934 --> 01:08.667
SEES ME, AND SAYS,
"GOOD MORNING, MR. MATTHEWS.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.200
I TRUST YOU'VE DONE
THE HOMEWORK."

01:10.200 --> 01:12.300
EVERY DAY
THE SAME THING.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.400
HE'S SO PREDICTABLE.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.200
GOOD MORNING,
MR. MATTHEWS.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.900
I TRUST YOU'VE DONE
THE HOMEWORK.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.000
YES, I DID, SIR.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.100
Both:
BUT MY LITTLE SISTER ATE IT.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.200
YOU ARE SO PREDICTABLE.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.467
THIS WEEK
IN SOCIAL STUDIES,

02:33.467 --> 02:35.900
WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT PREJUDICE.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.900
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M PREJUDICED
AGAINST THE SCUNGY FOOD

02:38.900 --> 02:40.567
IN THE CAFETERIA.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.300
[CLASS LAUGHS]

02:43.367 --> 02:45.467
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING
BLACK SLAVERY

02:45.467 --> 02:47.133
IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH,

02:47.133 --> 02:49.300
THE JEWS IN NAZI GERMANY,

02:49.300 --> 02:51.600
AND SEVERAL EXAMPLES
OF PREJUDICE

02:51.600 --> 02:52.667
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

02:52.667 --> 02:53.800
TONIGHT YOUR ASSIGNMENT

02:53.800 --> 02:57.200
IS TO READ THE FIRST
30 PAGES OF THAT BOOK.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.100
AW, MAN, IT'S A BOOK
ABOUT SOME GIRL.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.600
[BELL RINGS]

03:02.600 --> 03:04.367
MR. MATTHEWS.

03:04.367 --> 03:05.700
I'LL READ IT ANYWAY.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.467
I'LL DO MY HOMEWORK,
REALLY.

03:08.467 --> 03:10.400
I NOTE AN
ESCALATING TENDENCY

03:10.400 --> 03:12.300
FOR YOU TO MAKE
HUMOROUS COMMENTS

03:12.300 --> 03:14.834
ABOUT THE THINGS
I'M TEACHING, MR. MATTHEWS.

03:14.834 --> 03:17.300
YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB
VERY DIFFICULT.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.400
WELL, WE BOTH KNOW

03:18.400 --> 03:19.667
IT'S NOT VERY HARD
TO TEACH SIXTH GRADE,

03:19.667 --> 03:21.400
SO I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU SECRETLY LIKED

03:21.400 --> 03:23.600
THAT I MAKE IT
A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.033
OH, SO THAT'S IT.
MY JOB IS EASY.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.934
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SAME STUFF EVERY YEAR.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.200
THE ONLY THING THAT
CHANGES IS THE STUDENTS.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.867
YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

03:32.867 --> 03:34.300
YOU HAD THE EASY JOB,

03:34.300 --> 03:37.400
JUST SITTING IN CLASS,
LISTENING.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.500
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.667
35 HOURS A WEEK
IN HERE WITH YOU?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.200
MAJOR HOMEWORK
EVERY NIGHT?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.400
IT NEVER STOPS,
MR. FEENY.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.300
AND WANT TO KNOW WHAT
I GET FOR ALL THAT?

03:46.300 --> 03:48.000
5 MEASLY BUCKS A WEEK.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.400
YOU PROBABLY MAKE
THAT IN AN HOUR.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.033
YES, I DO.
THAT'S WHY I CAN AFFORD

03:53.033 --> 03:55.133
THAT FERRARI
IN MY DRIVEWAY.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.133
YOU DON'T DRIVE
A FERRARI.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.767
OH, RIGHT.
IT'S A GREMLIN.

04:00.834 --> 04:01.834
IN ANY EVENT,

04:01.834 --> 04:03.600
PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN
UNDERESTIMATING

04:03.600 --> 04:06.467
THE DIFFICULTY OF YOUR
JOB AS A SIXTH-GRADER.

04:06.467 --> 04:09.100
WELL, PERHAPS
YOU HAVE, MR. FEENY.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.300
MMM.
WHAT?

04:10.300 --> 04:14.567
I COULD GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO PROVE YOUR THEORY.

04:14.567 --> 04:16.233
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:16.233 --> 04:18.834
I MEAN, WHY DON'T
WE TRADE JOBS

04:18.834 --> 04:20.800
FOR THE REST
OF THE WEEK?

04:20.800 --> 04:23.000
BECAUSE YOU
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.100
OH, YES, I WOULD.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.100
YOU MAY TEACH ONE OF
MY CLASSES UNTIL FRIDAY,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.000
AT WHICH POINT, YOU WILL
ADMINISTER A TEST

04:30.000 --> 04:31.100
THAT I HAVE PREPARED.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.033
WILL I HAVE
TO TAKE IT?

04:33.033 --> 04:35.934
YOU'LL BE THE TEACHER,
MR. MATTHEWS.

04:35.934 --> 04:38.734
YOU'LL BE HAVING
THE EASY JOB--

04:38.734 --> 04:40.000
GIVING THE TEST.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.600
AND IF MORE STUDENTS
THAN NORMAL PASS,

04:43.600 --> 04:44.700
YOU WIN.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.867
AND IF MORE
STUDENTS FAIL, I WIN.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.300
SO WHILE I'M
DOING YOUR JOB,

04:50.300 --> 04:51.700
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.600
WELL, SINCE YOU'LL BE
SITTING IN MY SEAT,

04:54.600 --> 04:55.734
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

04:55.734 --> 04:59.000
THAT I SHOULD BE
SITTING IN YOURS.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.700
YOU MEAN, YOU'D BE,
LIKE, MY STUDENT?

05:02.700 --> 05:05.400
LIKE...YEAH.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.300
YES!

05:07.300 --> 05:08.567
WOULD YOU ENJOY THAT?

05:08.567 --> 05:09.734
YEAH, THAT'D BE OK.

05:09.734 --> 05:12.400
AND YOU'D BE TAKING
THE TEST, RIGHT?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
RIGHT.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.900
OK. DEAL.
JUST HOW YOU SAID.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.233
NO TAKE-BACKS.

05:18.233 --> 05:19.300
NO TAKE-BACKS.

05:19.300 --> 05:23.300
BUT WHY DON'T WE MAKE
THIS EXPERIMENT...

05:23.300 --> 05:25.934
A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.867
HI, MOM, HEY, WEEZ.

05:34.867 --> 05:35.867
HEY, ERIC.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.367
HI, NEW GIRLFRIEND.

05:38.367 --> 05:41.300
OH, IGNORE HER.
WHEN SHE WAS BORN,

05:41.300 --> 05:43.600
THE DOCTOR HAD TO PRY
HER LITTLE FOOT

05:43.600 --> 05:45.800
OUT OF HER BIG MOUTH.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.934
HI, I'M THE MOM.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:48.934 --> 05:50.033

SOMETHING TO EAT?

SURE.
COULD YOU, UH...

06:02.300 --> 06:03.500
UH, MORGAN, HONEY,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.200
I COULD REALLY, REALLY USE
YOUR HELP IN THE KITCHEN.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.100
WELL, YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO HAVE

06:07.100 --> 06:08.700
TO BE
MORE INDEPENDENT

06:08.700 --> 06:13.233
'CAUSE I WANT TO STAY
AND TALK TO LINDA.

06:13.233 --> 06:14.867
I TRIED.

06:14.867 --> 06:18.000
SO...YOU THINK I'M
A NEW GIRLFRIEND, DO YOU?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.200
UH-HUH.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.400
UH, GUYS, COULD WE TALK
ABOUT, LIKE, ANYTHING ELSE?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
ARE THERE A LOT OF
OLD GIRLFRIENDS?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
BILLIONS.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.500
DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE
THAT REAL SHARP PAIN

06:27.500 --> 06:29.600
BEHIND THEIR EYES?
I KNOW I DO.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.200
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I'M A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
YOUR BROTHER TOLD ME

06:32.200 --> 06:34.500
THAT HE JUST WANTED
TO STUDY WITH ME.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
OH, PLEASE.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.100
YOU'RE GOING TO FALL
FOR THAT ONE?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.000
MAJOR SNACKAGE
IS NOW BEING SERVED

06:42.000 --> 06:44.033
IN THE MAIN DINING ROOM.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.834
COME ON, IT'S
GETTING COLD.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.100
IT'S ICE CREAM.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.567
COME ON,
IT'S GETTING WARM.

06:48.567 --> 06:52.767
SO, ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME
MORGAN GOT HER OWN APARTMENT?

06:57.100 --> 06:58.967
WHOA! THAT BIKE IS FAST.

06:58.967 --> 07:00.667
I HEARD
YOUR ENGINE GROANING

07:00.667 --> 07:02.467
ON THAT LAST HILL,
DAD.

07:02.467 --> 07:03.667
WERE YOU TWO RACING?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.867
NO, NO. I WAS
JUST RUSHING HOME,

07:05.867 --> 07:06.900
AND DAD HAPPENED
TO SEE ME

07:06.900 --> 07:08.400
AND TRIED
TO CATCH UP.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
RACING.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.000
HURRYING IN
A MANLY FASHION.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.600
NOW, WHY WERE YOU
RUSHING TO GET HOME?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.100
I THINK YOU'D HANG
AROUND SCHOOL A WHILE

07:15.100 --> 07:16.300
AND SHOW OFF
YOUR NEW BIKE.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.300
OH, I COULDN'T WAIT
TO TELL YOU.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.567
MR. FEENY AND I
MADE A BET

07:19.567 --> 07:22.200
THAT I COULD TEACH SOCIAL
STUDIES BETTER THAN HE CAN.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.367
I'M GONNA BE THE TEACHER
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

07:25.367 --> 07:26.400
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.000
CORY, YOU BARELY
MANAGE A C-PLUS

07:28.000 --> 07:30.133
IN SOCIAL STUDIES.
HOW YOU GONNA TEACH IT?

07:30.133 --> 07:33.100
HEY, MOM. THE BOOK
DOES ALL THE TEACHING.

07:33.100 --> 07:37.200
FEENY'S JUST VANNA WHITE
POINTING TO THE LETTERS.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.100
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU
TWO HIGH ROLLERS BET?

07:41.100 --> 07:42.734
WELL, I PUT UP MY BIKE.

07:42.734 --> 07:45.467
WHAT? I JUST BOUGHT
YOU THAT BIKE!

07:45.467 --> 07:46.600
RELAX, DAD.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
FEENY'S THE ONE WHO'S
GOING TO LOSE BIG.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.500
WHAT DID MR. FEENY
PUT UP AGAINST YOUR BIKE,

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
HIS GARDEN WEASEL?

07:52.500 --> 07:56.100
1/5 OF HIS
WEEKLY PAYCHECK

07:56.100 --> 07:58.934
'CAUSE I'M TEACHING
ONE OF HIS FIVE CLASSES.

07:58.934 --> 08:01.567
AND COME FRIDAY,
I'M RICH!

08:02.600 --> 08:05.367
WHY DOES FEENY
WANT THAT BIKE?

08:05.367 --> 08:07.867
OH, ALAN, OBVIOUSLY,

08:07.867 --> 08:09.667
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
MR. FEENY LESSON THINGS.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.000
WELL, WHAT IF
THE LESSON IS...

08:12.000 --> 08:14.500
"I WANT THAT BIKE"?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.400
NOW, I'M REALLY
IN CHARGE.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.100
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO CALL THE BET OFF

08:24.100 --> 08:26.300
IF I DO THINGS
A TEENSY BIT DIFFERENT

08:26.300 --> 08:27.667
FROM THE WAY YOU WOULD?

08:27.667 --> 08:29.500
WE MADE A BET,
MR. MATTHEWS.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.300
IT'S YOUR CLASS.
THEY ARE YOUR MINDS TO MOLD.

08:33.300 --> 08:36.934
COOL!

08:36.934 --> 08:39.000
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.734
FOR THE REST
OF THE WEEK,

08:40.734 --> 08:43.734
I'M GOING TO BE
YOUR SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER.

08:43.734 --> 08:47.467
MR. FEENY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:49.367 --> 08:51.934
DON'T ASK ME.
HE'S THE MAN IN CHARGE.

08:51.934 --> 08:54.600
THAT'S RIGHT,
MINKUS, MY BOY. ME.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.400
I'M YOUR NEW TEACHER,
AND MY NAME IS...

09:02.200 --> 09:03.900
HEY...

09:06.233 --> 09:08.600
DUDE.

09:10.367 --> 09:14.500
THAT ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU...GEORGE?

09:14.500 --> 09:17.867
<i>MI CLASE ES SU CLASE.</i>

09:18.934 --> 09:20.800
AND YOU GUYS KNOW THAT RULE

09:20.800 --> 09:23.867
ABOUT NO BASEBALL CAPS
IN CLASS?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.300
HISTORY!

09:25.300 --> 09:27.200
YEAH!
YEAH!

09:29.100 --> 09:30.200
YEAH, TOPANGA.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.967
IF WE'RE GOING TO
ELIMINATE THE CAP RULE,

09:31.967 --> 09:35.400
CAN WE ALSO DISCARD
THE DRESS CODE IN ITS ENTIRETY?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.567
WHY? YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT SHOWING UP...

09:38.567 --> 09:41.133
LIKE, NAKED
TOMORROW, ARE YOU?

09:41.133 --> 09:42.300
OOH!
OOH!

09:42.300 --> 09:45.500
NO. ALTHOUGH I FIND NOTHING
SHAMEFUL ABOUT NUDITY.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.400
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WEARING GARMENTS

09:47.400 --> 09:50.200
FROM CULTURES MORE
IN TUNE WITH THE GODDESS.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.500
A SARI, PERHAPS,
OR A PAREO.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.700
YEAH, FINE. AS LONG AS
YOU'RE COVERED UP.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.200
PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.900
ARE WE GOING TO DO OUR
SOCIAL STUDIES WORK TODAY?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.734
MINKUS, MINKUS, MINKUS.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.133
SHUT UP.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.500
OK, GUYS,
FOR HOMEWORK TONIGHT,

10:08.500 --> 10:11.834
READ THE FIRST 30 PAGES
IN WHATEVER THAT BOOK WAS

10:11.834 --> 10:13.867
THAT GEORGE ASSIGNED US
YESTERDAY.

10:13.867 --> 10:15.734
BUT THAT WAS
THE ASSIGNMENT LAST NIGHT.

10:15.734 --> 10:20.800
MINKUS! NOT LONG AGO,
I WAS A STUDENT MYSELF,

10:20.800 --> 10:23.400
AND I REMEMBER
THAT SIXTH-GRADERS

10:23.400 --> 10:25.100
DON'T ALWAYS DO
THEIR HOMEWORK,

10:25.100 --> 10:27.867
SO THIS WAY, EVERYONE
GETS A SECOND CHANCE.

10:27.867 --> 10:33.700
EXCUSE ME, MR. HEY DUDE,
BUT I DID MY HOMEWORK.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.133
MINKUS, GET A LIFE.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.000
THAT'S YOUR
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.967
GET A LIFE.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.900
HEY, DAD.
HEY, WEEZ.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.300
HEY, WEASEL,
CHECK IT OUT.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.100
LOOK WHAT LINDA
SENT FOR YOU.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.500
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT IS IT?

10:49.500 --> 10:52.734
THIS IS A GENUINE
JAPANESE LANTERN.

10:52.734 --> 10:53.867
THAT WAS VERY NICE
OF LINDA.

10:53.867 --> 10:55.200
YEAH. SHE BROUGHT IT ALL
THE WAY BACK FROM TOKYO

10:55.200 --> 10:56.367
AND SHE WANTS YOU
TO HAVE IT.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.734
LOOK, YOU PUT IT OVER THE LAMP
YOU HAVE IN YOUR ROOM,

10:58.734 --> 11:00.900
ALL THE PRETTY COLORS
WILL SHINE THROUGH.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.600
I'M GONNA TRY IT
RIGHT NOW.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
ALL RIGHT.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.700
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

11:04.700 --> 11:06.400
I CAN'T TALK, DAD.
I GOT TO GO CALL LINDA.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.367
DIDN'T YOU JUST
LEAVE HER HOUSE?

11:08.367 --> 11:10.600
THAT WAS
10 MINUTES AGO.

11:12.567 --> 11:16.500
I'M THE GREATEST TEACHER IN
THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.700
IT WENT
THAT WELL, HUH?

11:17.700 --> 11:20.967
BY THE END OF THE DAY,
IT WAS ONE BIG CLASS PARTY.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.200
WELL, WHAT WAS MR. FEENY
DOING DURING THIS PARTY?

11:23.200 --> 11:26.600
SHAWN WAS TEACHING HIM
HOW TO PLAY POKER FOR GUM.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.500
WELL, WHEN DID YOU ACTUALLY
TEACH THE LESSON?

11:29.500 --> 11:30.600
I TOLD YOU, DAD.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.300
THE TEACHER DOESN'T
REALLY DO ANYTHING.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.600
YOU READ THE BOOK,
YOU PASS THE TEST.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.200
DID YOU READ THE BOOK?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.467
I SKIMMED IT.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.467
WELL, WHAT
WAS IT ABOUT?

11:39.467 --> 11:42.300
IT WAS ABOUT
THE NAZIS AND THE JEWS

11:42.300 --> 11:43.467
A LONG TIME AGO.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.200
WHEN THERE WAS
PREJUDICE AND STUFF.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.233
A LONG TIME AGO.

11:46.233 --> 11:49.367
YEAH. THE STUFF
<i>IS </i>HISTORY, DAD.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.400
CORY, NOT THAT
I SUDDENLY THINK

11:51.400 --> 11:52.967
YOUR BIKE IS IN,
LIKE...

11:52.967 --> 11:56.100
REAL SIGNIFICANT
DANGER HERE, BUT...

11:56.100 --> 11:57.100
COULD YOU GIVE ME

11:57.100 --> 11:58.900
THE DETAILS OF
THIS BET AGAIN?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.500
OK. BASED ON
THE WAY HE GRADES,

12:01.500 --> 12:03.700
IF MORE STUDENTS THAN
USUAL PASS THE TEST,

12:03.700 --> 12:04.700
THEN I WIN.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.367
BASED ON THE WAY
HE GRADES.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.367
RIGHT.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.400
HOW DOES HE GRADE?
HUH?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.500
DOES HE GRADE ON A CURVE?
HUH?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.667
FEENY'S GONNA SCORE
PRETTY HIGH, RIGHT?

12:11.667 --> 12:12.734
HE WROTE THE TEST.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.867
CORY, FIGURE IT OUT.
HE GRADES ON THE CURVE.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.967
THE HIGHER HE SCORES,
THE MORE KIDS WILL FAIL.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.400
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:19.400 --> 12:22.934
THAT MEANS
YOUR BIKE IS GONE.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.700
<i>Cory: LOOK,</i>
<i>YOU HAVE TO HELP ME</i>

12:31.700 --> 12:33.300
GET THE CLASS
BACK UNDER CONTROL.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.200
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
LET IT GET OUT OF CONTROL.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.800
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
PLAYING POKER WITH FEENY.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.900
LIGHTEN UP, MAN.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.233
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
LIKE A TEACHER.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.767
[BELL RINGS]

12:42.767 --> 12:45.934
UH, TOPANGA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:45.934 --> 12:47.500
MOVING MY DESK
OUT OF THE WAY.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.133
I'VE DECIDED I'D RATHER SIT ON
A TRADITIONAL YOGA CUSHION.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.967
OH, COME ON, MINKUS,
DON'T TELL ME

12:58.967 --> 13:02.100
YOU WANT TO SIT ON
A YOGURT CUSHION!

13:02.100 --> 13:04.467
NO. YOU TOLD ME
TO GET A LIFE.

13:04.467 --> 13:08.500
NOW I'M GOING TO BE
AS FUN AS THE NEXT GUY.

13:09.767 --> 13:13.600
OK. I KNOW THINGS GOT A
LITTLE LOOSE HERE YESTERDAY,

13:13.600 --> 13:16.133
BUT WE'VE GOT A TEST
DAY AFTER TOMORROW

13:16.133 --> 13:19.200
AND IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.500
LET'S START
WITH THE ROLL CALL.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.600
UH, LAWRENCE, TOPANGA.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.800
I'M CHANNELING.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.000
I WILL ONLY ANSWER
TO THE NAME...

13:32.000 --> 13:35.600
[GROWLS]

13:44.100 --> 13:47.800
OK. PRESENT,
BUT NOT ALL HERE.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.500
UH, HUNTER, SHAWN.

13:52.567 --> 13:54.100
HUNTER, SHAWN.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.967
OUT OF MY FACE.
I'M STACKING THE DECK.

13:56.967 --> 14:00.767
HEY. WHERE'S MR. FEENY?
I MEAN, GEORGE.

14:00.767 --> 14:04.300
HEY, DUDE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

14:04.300 --> 14:08.033
I WAS CHILLIN'
WITH MY HOMIES.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.834
I'M IN.

14:13.100 --> 14:16.133
MINKUS,
THIS IS SOCIAL STUDIES.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.667
STOP MAKING
THOSE PAPER TURKEYS.

14:18.667 --> 14:19.800
THEY'RE FLAMINGOES,

14:19.800 --> 14:21.500
AND QUIT
CALLING ME MINKUS.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.300
YOU CALL EVERYONE ELSE
BY THEIR FIRST NAME,

14:24.300 --> 14:28.100
SO START
CALLING ME STUART.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.900
I SEE YOUR JUICY FRUIT,

14:30.900 --> 14:34.500
AND I RAISE YOU
A CHICLET.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.100
STILL READING
THAT BOOK, HUH, COR?

14:48.100 --> 14:50.600
JUST TRYING TO
PREPARE FOR CLASS.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.233
YOU KNOW,
THIS TEACHING STUFF

14:52.233 --> 14:54.033
ISN'T AS EASY
AS IT LOOKS.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.200
IT'S NOT, HUH?

14:55.200 --> 14:58.000
NOPE. NOBODY IN CLASS WILL
PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ME.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.934
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU TRIED TO BE THEIR PAL

15:00.934 --> 15:02.400
INSTEAD OF THEIR TEACHER.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.000
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SET YOURSELF
APART FROM THE CLASS,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.600
BE MORE AUTHORITATIVE.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
HOW DO I DO THAT?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.700
HOW DOES FEENY DO IT?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.600
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER PAID ATTENTION.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.400
COME ON, LET'S GO SIT
ON THE COUCH, ALL RIGHT?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.233
ERIC?

15:21.233 --> 15:22.500
I GOT IT, COR.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.500
[CRYING]

15:23.500 --> 15:27.200
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE OK, ALL RIGHT?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.800
ERIC?

15:28.800 --> 15:32.100
I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER, COR.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.600
OH, IT'S GETTING
CHILLY OUT THERE.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.300
LINDA! LINDA!

15:37.400 --> 15:39.734
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH LINDA?

15:39.734 --> 15:43.200
SOME JERK AT THE MALL
CALLED HER A BAD NAME.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.233
WHERE? OUR MALL?

15:45.233 --> 15:47.400
WHAT DID
HE CALL YOU?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.834
OH, IT'S NOT
IMPORTANT, MORGAN.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.600
IN OUR MALL
RIGHT HERE?

15:51.600 --> 15:52.734
THANK YOU.

15:52.734 --> 15:58.000
A BOY AT DAYCARE ONCE
CALLED ME POO-POO HEAD.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.066
THANKS, MORGAN.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.000
MOM.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.100
COME ON, MORGAN.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.500
LET'S MAKE SOME
HOT COCOA FOR EVERYBODY.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.300
MAN, SOMETIMES PEOPLE
CAN BE TOTAL IDIOTS.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.967
THIS HAPPENED TODAY?

16:19.500 --> 16:25.200
Shawn: HEY, MR. GQ.
NICE NECKWEAR.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.400
EXCELLENT WINDSOR KNOT.
DID YOUR MOM TIE IT?

16:28.400 --> 16:32.367
MINKUS--STUART,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.100
YOU'RE THE SMARTEST
KID IN CLASS,

16:34.100 --> 16:35.800
AND MAYBE IF YOU PAY
ATTENTION TO ME,

16:35.800 --> 16:37.000
SOME OF
THE OTHER KIDS WILL.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.600
WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU?
YOU MADE FUN OF MR. FEENY

16:40.600 --> 16:43.133
AND SAID HE GETS
PAID TOO MUCH.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.500
[BELL RINGS]

16:44.500 --> 16:45.567
HEY, DUDE.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.400
OOH, THAT SUIT.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.600
IT'S NOT COOL.

16:52.133 --> 16:56.100
CLASS, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO
YOU TODAY ABOUT PREJUDICE

16:56.100 --> 17:00.200
AND HOW IT STILL EXISTS
IN TODAY'S WORLD.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT
TILL LAST NIGHT

17:03.000 --> 17:06.967
WHEN I SAW A REAL SMART,
TOTALLY COOL ASIAN GIRL

17:06.967 --> 17:11.500
CRYING HER EYES OUT BECAUSE
SOME IDIOT AT THE MALL

17:11.500 --> 17:14.033
CALLED HER A BAD NAME.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.400
MY LESSON FOR TODAY

17:16.400 --> 17:20.033
IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE TREAT
OTHER PEOPLE BADLY

17:20.033 --> 17:24.867
BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR
OR THEIR RELIGION

17:24.867 --> 17:26.600
OR WHERE THEY COME FROM,

17:26.600 --> 17:29.500
THEN REAL SMART,
TOTALLY COOL PEOPLE

17:29.500 --> 17:31.467
CAN REALLY SUFFER.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.767
Shawn: HEY, GEORGE,
THIS ISN'T GUM.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.567
THESE ARE ROLAIDS.

17:35.567 --> 17:39.300
DEAL ME OUT OF
THIS ONE, MR. HUNTER.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
WHAT? WHY?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.100
OK. YOU WIN.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.400
I'M A CRUMMY TEACHER,
AND I RESIGN.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.934
HEY, SHAWN, BEFORE
YOUR MOTHER GOT MARRIED,

17:57.934 --> 17:59.700
WHAT WAS HER NAME AGAIN?

17:59.700 --> 18:00.867
CORDINI.

18:00.867 --> 18:01.800
CORDINI.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.467
SO, THAT WOULD MAKE
YOU A WOP, RIGHT?

18:06.467 --> 18:08.233
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

18:08.233 --> 18:10.700
YOU HEARD WHAT
I CALLED YOU.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.300
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
HE CALLED ME?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.667
I HEARD WHAT
HE CALLED YOU.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
HE'S THE TEACHER.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.867
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

18:18.867 --> 18:20.500
I'M GONNA KNOCK
HIS HEAD OFF!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.600
WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.900
WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.100
WHAT?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.200
WHAT IF YOU LIVED IN A COUNTRY
WHERE I COULD KILL YOU

18:28.200 --> 18:30.467
JUST BECAUSE OF
YOUR MOM'S LAST NAME?

18:30.467 --> 18:32.700
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:32.700 --> 18:37.500
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL
IS DEAD!

18:39.934 --> 18:42.300
DOESN'T ANYBODY CARE?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.867
CORY...

18:44.867 --> 18:49.033
SHE WAS REAL SMART
AND TOTALLY COOL.

18:49.033 --> 18:51.700
SHE WROTE THIS BOOK.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.734
HER NAME
WAS ANNE FRANK.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.100
THEY SAY
SHE DIED OF TYPHUS,

18:58.100 --> 19:00.300
BUT THEY KILLED HER

19:00.300 --> 19:03.500
BECAUSE HER NAME
WAS ANNE FRANK.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.767
ANNE FRANK WAS A VICTIM
OF ANTISEMITISM.

19:08.767 --> 19:11.467
ANTI-SEMITISM.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.400
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.967
YOU HAVE TO READ
THIS BOOK,

19:17.967 --> 19:21.800
AND YOU HAVE
TO PASS THIS TEST

19:21.800 --> 19:23.300
NOT BECAUSE OF ME,

19:23.300 --> 19:24.800
BUT BECAUSE
WHEN SOMEONE

19:24.800 --> 19:27.667
CALLS SOMEONE ELSE
A BAD NAME,

19:27.667 --> 19:28.667
IT'S NOT GOOD

19:28.667 --> 19:31.967
THAT JUST THAT
ONE PERSON JUMPS UP.

19:31.967 --> 19:34.667
WE ALL HAVE TO JUMP UP.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.500
"IN SPITE
OF EVERYTHING,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.867
"I STILL BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE

19:45.867 --> 19:48.667
ARE REALLY
GOOD AT HEART."

19:53.400 --> 19:55.300
SO, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

19:55.300 --> 19:57.300
AM I RIDING THE BUS
TO SCHOOL FROM NOW ON?

19:57.300 --> 19:58.900
NO. THE SAME NUMBER
OF STUDENTS

19:58.900 --> 20:00.600
PASSED THE TEST
AS USUAL.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.100
IT'S A DRAW. YOU GET
TO KEEP YOUR BIKE.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.233
GOOD.

20:04.233 --> 20:07.500
YOU MEAN SOME PEOPLE
STILL FAILED?

20:07.500 --> 20:10.834
IT HAPPENS NO MATTER
HOW GOOD A TEACHER YOU ARE.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.200
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.834
I GUESS I DIDN'T DO
SUCH A GOOD JOB.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.934
ON THE CONTRARY,
MR. MATTHEWS,

20:16.934 --> 20:18.900
YOU DID
AN EXCELLENT JOB.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.033
MR. HUNTER,
FOR INSTANCE,

20:20.033 --> 20:22.900
GOT A FULL GRADE HIGHER
THAN HE USUALLY DOES.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.767
SOMEHOW YOU MUST HAVE
GOTTEN HIS ATTENTION.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.200
SHAWN GOT A "B"?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.400
MM-HMM.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.133
AT LEAST ONE GUY LEARNED
SOMETHING FROM ME THIS WEEK.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.967
TWO.
TWO? WHO ELSE?

20:33.967 --> 20:35.400
YOU, MR. MATTHEWS.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.233
