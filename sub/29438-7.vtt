WEBVTT

00:00.898 --> 00:02.915
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.916 --> 00:04.845
Hey, Cindy. You're exhausted.

00:04.846 --> 00:07.156
Red Rock can schedule more
operations and make more money.

00:07.157 --> 00:09.158
I'm pulling rank. Go home.
There's got to be someone

00:09.159 --> 00:11.160
- who can swap with you.
- Me. I got you covered.

00:11.161 --> 00:13.162
You just finished
back-to-back surgeries, too.

00:13.163 --> 00:16.091
Well, then I'll be in
back-to-back-to-back surgeries.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.520
They are still working

00:19.521 --> 00:22.463
on my request for Hemopleatin data.

00:22.464 --> 00:24.247
The more time, the
more patients could die.

00:24.248 --> 00:25.585
We need help with something.

00:25.586 --> 00:27.423
We're doing a little research on a drug.

00:27.424 --> 00:30.039
An exclusive with DiaCure renal services

00:30.040 --> 00:31.164
would help us all out.

00:31.964 --> 00:34.323
Chastain uses the drug

00:34.324 --> 00:36.349
Hemopleatin to treat anemia.

00:36.350 --> 00:38.402
Nic's sister, Jessie... she was on it.

00:38.403 --> 00:40.496
She died of a massive
pulmonary embolism,

00:40.497 --> 00:43.815
just like five more of our
patients on Hemopleatin.

00:43.816 --> 00:46.576
I think this drug is causing
these fatal blood clots.

00:46.577 --> 00:48.504
Get to the point. I have a busy day.

00:48.505 --> 00:50.530
Well, you're familiar
with the company DiaCure?

00:50.531 --> 00:52.982
The biggest dialysis
provider in the country.

00:52.983 --> 00:54.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I-I met their CEO at their annual

00:54.968 --> 00:56.499
shareholders' meeting last night.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.089
He agreed to give us access
to all their patient records...

00:59.090 --> 01:02.709
in exchange for an
exclusive deal with Chastain.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.882
Since when did you start
doing business deals?

01:04.882 --> 01:06.436
I didn't agree to anything, obviously.

01:06.437 --> 01:07.894
- Well...
- Yeah, it's your call.

01:07.895 --> 01:10.230
But bottom line, if
Hemopleatin is killing people,

01:10.231 --> 01:12.628
and Chastain can prove it,

01:12.629 --> 01:14.068
- we're saving lives.
- I'm, uh...

01:14.069 --> 01:16.006
I'm not gonna go into
business with anyone

01:16.007 --> 01:17.645
on the basis of your wild hunches.

01:17.646 --> 01:19.944
Take my wild hunch out of the equation.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.396
DiaCure is still an excellent
partner for Chastain,

01:22.397 --> 01:24.756
regardless.

01:28.916 --> 01:31.081
It's Jessica.

01:31.082 --> 01:33.938
Car versus tree. GCS 7 on arrival.

01:33.939 --> 01:36.014
Head trauma with
positive seat belt sign.

01:36.015 --> 01:38.374
- BP 60 over palp.
- Okay. How long was she out there?

01:38.375 --> 01:40.043
Took an hour to extricate
her. Not sure how long

01:40.044 --> 01:41.882
Jessica was waiting
before she was found.

01:41.883 --> 01:44.747
Oh, my God. Jess. Jess!

01:44.748 --> 01:46.266
- Oh, my God.
- You're home now, sweetie.

01:46.267 --> 01:48.276
Jess!

01:49.424 --> 01:51.166
- How is she?
- We don't know yet,

01:51.167 --> 01:52.266
but we got her.

01:53.353 --> 01:56.021
Unhook her. Let's move her.

01:56.022 --> 01:57.931
And on my count, let's go.

01:57.932 --> 01:59.782
One, two, three.

02:02.096 --> 02:05.195
- What happened?
- Don't know. Nobody around, no skid marks.

02:05.196 --> 02:06.890
Might have fallen asleep at the wheel.

02:06.891 --> 02:08.199
Oh, my God.

02:08.201 --> 02:11.853
What's her access? She needs volume now.

02:11.854 --> 02:14.173
One 22-gauge in her thumb.

02:14.174 --> 02:15.831
We're trying to get a bigger peripheral,

02:15.832 --> 02:17.150
but her veins are all collapsed.

02:17.151 --> 02:19.903
She was tired. She was
coming off a double shift.

02:19.904 --> 02:21.288
You need to leave, Dr. Feldman.

02:21.289 --> 02:23.549
Give me an introducer.
I will get access.

02:23.550 --> 02:25.884
Nurse, hold her C-spine.

02:25.885 --> 02:28.235
Abdomen's soft. I got the FAST.

02:28.236 --> 02:30.055
I'll do it. I have to do something.

02:30.056 --> 02:31.942
- You need to let us take care of her.
- What?

02:31.943 --> 02:34.560
You need to let us take
care of her. We got this.

02:34.561 --> 02:37.587
We got it.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.306
No.

02:39.307 --> 02:40.899
- Pravesh, Pravesh. Pravesh!
- No!

02:40.900 --> 02:42.292
- Whoa, whoa.
- Pravesh, get him out of here!

02:42.293 --> 02:44.255
- Get him out of here now!
- No! Get off of me!

02:44.256 --> 02:46.071
- Go.
- No! Get your hands off of me!

02:46.072 --> 02:49.074
- Wait. Wait.
- Let me stay! I want to stay in the room.

02:49.075 --> 02:50.317
I've got to stay in the room.

02:50.318 --> 02:51.577
Now anything?

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074

- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

03:17.294 --> 03:20.255
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- She's been down too long.

03:20.256 --> 03:22.608
- How much more time?!
- Another 20 seconds.

03:22.609 --> 03:24.777
- Where's that introducer?
- Happening as fast

03:24.778 --> 03:26.803
- as superhumanly possible.
- Ah.

03:26.804 --> 03:28.321
Come on.

03:29.857 --> 03:33.619
All right, and we... are... in.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.196
Get that blood in her now
and add an amp of bicarb.

03:40.276 --> 03:42.393
Two minutes. Pulse check.

03:45.281 --> 03:47.877
- -I got a pulse. We got a pulse.
- All right. All right.

03:47.878 --> 03:49.617
All right. All right.

03:49.618 --> 03:52.161
- It's thready, but it's there. Jess?
- Okay. All right.

03:52.162 --> 03:53.830
- It's thready, but it's there.
- Here we go.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.164
Jess. Jess, welcome back.

03:55.165 --> 03:56.883
Now stay with me. Stay with me!

03:56.884 --> 03:59.719
Okay, come on. All right.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.815
Abdomen's not so soft now.

04:05.009 --> 04:06.984
Come on.

04:10.064 --> 04:13.066
It's full of blood. It's full of blood.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.160
We got to find the
bleeding and stop it now.

04:15.161 --> 04:16.970
Hundley, call the OR.

04:17.980 --> 04:19.998
Hundley!

04:19.999 --> 04:23.001
- Page Neuro.
- How are the pupils?

04:23.002 --> 04:24.126
They're reactive, but...

04:26.447 --> 04:28.197
We need Neuro. Let's go. Come on.

04:28.198 --> 04:30.342
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

04:30.343 --> 04:32.660
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:32.661 --> 04:34.254
How is she?

04:34.255 --> 04:36.497
Massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.758
- She's in good hands now.
- I got the page.

04:38.759 --> 04:40.710
What's with the audience?

04:40.711 --> 04:43.720
She's one of your scrub
nurses... Jessica Moore.

04:43.721 --> 04:45.715
She's been in nearly
half of your surgeries.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.772
She needs a head CT.

04:47.773 --> 04:49.848
No time. She'll bleed out
on the CT table.

04:49.849 --> 04:52.034
- We do this now.
- I'll just put in an extraventricular drain

04:52.035 --> 04:53.435
to measure pressure and
control the swelling.

04:53.436 --> 04:55.641
- I can do that blind.
- Well, that's quite reassuring.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.102
My job isn't to reassure you.

05:00.689 --> 05:03.041
So, that's where we are.
Thanks for checking in.

05:03.042 --> 05:04.951
- I'll keep you posted.
- Dr. Bell?

05:04.952 --> 05:07.044
- Yeah?
- How is she?

05:11.533 --> 05:13.551
They're taking her for
an emergency ex-lap.

05:17.798 --> 05:19.424
This is on Red Rock.

05:19.425 --> 05:21.042
- I...
- They cut staff,

05:21.043 --> 05:23.395
overscheduled the OR, and
now Jessica's paying for it.

05:23.396 --> 05:25.972
- We need more nurses.
- Can we just talk about this later?

05:25.973 --> 05:28.091
No!

05:28.092 --> 05:30.477
We lost some of our
best due to the hours

05:30.478 --> 05:32.653
and salary cuts that
Red Rock instituted.

05:32.654 --> 05:35.073
- Uh...
- I have people working a double shift right now.

05:35.074 --> 05:37.058
- Do you want more Jessicas?
- No, of course not.

05:37.059 --> 05:39.745
I'm devastated by this. I...
You have... you have any idea

05:39.746 --> 05:41.535
how many hours I've spent
in an OR with Jessica?

05:41.536 --> 05:44.082
How many times she's had
my back in a tough surgery?

05:44.083 --> 05:47.118
Don't suggest that I don't
care what's happening to her.

05:48.362 --> 05:50.446
She's not just a member of my team.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.341
She's like... She's family to me.

05:57.579 --> 05:59.580
Look...

05:59.581 --> 06:01.958
I have one nurse today,
and she's a student.

06:01.959 --> 06:05.011
Even if she was fully trained,
that's not nearly enough.

06:05.012 --> 06:07.897
We can't keep doing this. We need help.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.301
I'll see what I can do
about getting more nurses.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.236
Okay.

06:19.527 --> 06:21.144
Hey.

06:21.145 --> 06:22.870
Hey, how is she?

06:26.275 --> 06:28.125
Cain and Raptor are
just getting started.

06:31.134 --> 06:32.984
Did you get ahold of her parents?

06:34.375 --> 06:36.993
They're on their way.

06:36.994 --> 06:38.453
From Europe.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.341
They go twice a year...
Bordeaux and Tuscany.

06:42.342 --> 06:44.667
This is their, uh, Bordeaux trip.

06:44.668 --> 06:47.503
Apparently, they're really into wine.

06:47.504 --> 06:50.398
She was going to introduce
me to them at Thanksgiving.

06:54.487 --> 06:57.972
Um... they're getting
on a plane right now.

06:57.973 --> 07:00.349
No contact for several hours.

07:00.350 --> 07:03.786
Have they designated a health
care proxy until they get here?

07:05.481 --> 07:07.332
Yes. Me.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.192
Good. Good choice. You're a doctor.

07:09.193 --> 07:10.693
Let me help you start
that paperwork, okay?

07:10.694 --> 07:13.246
No. No, no, no, no.

07:13.247 --> 07:15.490
I'm not leaving her.

07:15.491 --> 07:19.344
Irving, I know that you are scared.

07:19.345 --> 07:21.204
Scared?

07:21.205 --> 07:23.331
Scared does not cover it.

07:23.332 --> 07:24.683
This is all my fault.

07:24.684 --> 07:27.710
How is this your fault?

07:27.711 --> 07:30.263
She's been pulling doubles for days.

07:30.264 --> 07:33.716
And then, we had that game night.

07:33.717 --> 07:35.384
I knew she was exhausted.

07:35.385 --> 07:38.554
And... yesterday,

07:38.555 --> 07:40.531
she was heading out, and I...

07:49.208 --> 07:52.860
Okay. Five seconds of action,
and then I'm on the road.

07:52.861 --> 07:55.321
Oh. Mmm.

07:57.074 --> 07:58.458
Usually, it's at least

07:58.459 --> 08:00.385
- ten seconds.
- Well...

08:00.386 --> 08:03.371
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

08:03.372 --> 08:05.057
It's totally what a girl wants to hear

08:05.058 --> 08:07.208
from a guy whose scrubs
she wants to get into.

08:07.209 --> 08:09.061
No, no, no. You know I
always think you're beautiful.

08:09.062 --> 08:11.087
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm just wondering if you need a ride home.

08:11.088 --> 08:13.732
Okay, least sexy
supply closet time ever.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.258
I'm sorry.

08:15.259 --> 08:18.052
- Okay. Much better?
- Mm-hmm.

08:18.053 --> 08:20.238
I let her go.

08:20.239 --> 08:22.390
No. No.

08:22.391 --> 08:24.409
You did not let her do anything.

08:24.410 --> 08:26.936
This is not on you or her.

08:26.937 --> 08:30.865
If you want to blame
someone, blame Red Rock.

08:30.866 --> 08:32.958
Assigning blame doesn't help Jessica.

08:35.236 --> 08:37.280
Focus on what you can do now.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.423
Okay?

08:43.504 --> 08:45.505
I will stay on the OR floor.

08:45.506 --> 08:48.508
I will be right here to get updates.

08:48.509 --> 08:53.438
I will let you know as
soon as I hear anything.

08:53.439 --> 08:56.440
I will meet up with you in the ICU.

09:00.354 --> 09:02.363
Go.

09:08.437 --> 09:10.646
Before we begin, a quick gut check.

09:10.647 --> 09:12.273
One of our own is on the table.

09:12.274 --> 09:14.292
Anyone too tired... physically

09:14.293 --> 09:16.628
or emotionally... should step out now.

09:16.629 --> 09:18.446
Should I step out?

09:18.447 --> 09:20.656
I worked two 30-hour shifts this week.

09:20.657 --> 09:24.118
Oh, wait. I'm the brain surgeon.
I should probably stay.

09:24.119 --> 09:27.639
It's important that we are all
in tip-top shape for Jessica.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.057
So again, are we good?

09:31.719 --> 09:33.720
Nurse,

09:33.721 --> 09:35.815
how many shifts have you had this week?

09:35.816 --> 09:38.132
Not as many as Jessica.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.600
She, um...

09:41.303 --> 09:43.804
She covered for me yesterday.

09:43.805 --> 09:47.734
Then I'm going to have
to ask you to step out.

09:47.735 --> 09:49.577
For Jessica.

09:51.739 --> 09:53.080
Okay.

09:56.076 --> 09:58.745
That's a nice plan. Now
we're down a scrub nurse

09:58.746 --> 10:00.279
without enough time to replace her.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.573
- I'll do it.
- Aren't you a resident?

10:02.574 --> 10:05.920
I'm a surgeon. Surely I can
handle scrub nurse duties.

10:05.921 --> 10:07.703
Well, then it's settled.

10:07.704 --> 10:11.974
Nurse/Doctor Mina Okafor
is on the case. Let's go.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.342
How long have you
been in nursing school?

10:21.343 --> 10:22.871
Uh, two years. I'm so excited

10:22.872 --> 10:24.696
to finally be here in a real hospital.

10:24.697 --> 10:27.014
Can't wait to get into
the trenches, you know.

10:27.015 --> 10:29.711
Really start practicing medicine.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.537
Good, 'cause you're about
to hit the ground running.

10:32.538 --> 10:35.398
We're working general
medicine and the ICU today.

10:35.399 --> 10:37.290
Wow. Is that, is that normal?

10:37.291 --> 10:38.451
No. It's a disaster.

10:38.452 --> 10:41.862
We're shorthanded, and we're
down one very important woman.

10:41.863 --> 10:43.239
I heard about the scrub nurse

10:43.240 --> 10:45.217
while I was filling out my paperwork.

10:45.218 --> 10:48.053
- I'm sorry. I hope she's okay.
- Me, too.

10:48.054 --> 10:49.721
I'll be going between
our patients and checking

10:49.722 --> 10:53.061
on Jessica today, so... I
need you to keep up with me.

10:53.062 --> 10:54.366
Oh, yeah. I'll try.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.586
- Oh, my God.
- Dad.

10:56.587 --> 10:58.879
Ah. Oh, I heard there was an accident,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.257
a Chastain nurse. I was terrified.

11:01.258 --> 11:02.717
Well, I'm fine.

11:02.718 --> 11:04.310
Okay, you can let go now.

11:04.311 --> 11:05.570
All right.

11:05.571 --> 11:07.430
I'm okay. Uh, this is,

11:07.431 --> 11:09.315
uh, Clara. She's our student nurse.

11:09.316 --> 11:10.467
- Hi.
- That's my dad, Kyle Nevin.

11:10.468 --> 11:11.951
I will update you on Jessica later,

11:11.952 --> 11:13.078
but right now I got to go.

11:13.079 --> 11:15.271
Hey, hey, hey. I can help.

11:15.272 --> 11:16.915
Uh...

11:16.916 --> 11:19.036
Isn't it pretty great?

11:19.037 --> 11:21.086
First day on the job as a volunteer.

11:21.087 --> 11:24.780
Well, I guess I will be training
you both simultaneously.

11:24.781 --> 11:26.590
Go Team Nevin.

11:35.768 --> 11:38.727
Thank you. Thank you.

11:40.578 --> 11:41.595
Hi.

11:43.776 --> 11:45.359
How is she?

11:46.445 --> 11:48.596
Um...

11:48.597 --> 11:51.178
she had massive internal
injuries from the accident.

11:51.179 --> 11:53.768
But Austin and Mina were
able to repair everything

11:53.769 --> 11:56.295
- in her abdomen.
- It's her brain that's the issue.

11:57.773 --> 11:59.791
She was showing signs of increased

11:59.792 --> 12:02.109
intracranial pressure, so...

12:02.110 --> 12:03.794
Cain put a drain in.

12:04.797 --> 12:07.874
Have they done a post-op CT?

12:07.875 --> 12:10.043
Yeah, and there was no bleed.

12:10.044 --> 12:11.434
That's good news.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.244
But there are signs of swelling.

12:19.011 --> 12:20.614
Keeping an eye on her.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.341
And being positive.

12:26.343 --> 12:28.135
Here, let me do that.

12:28.136 --> 12:30.846
I'm her health care
proxy and a doctor, so...

12:30.847 --> 12:32.473
I'm responsible.

12:32.474 --> 12:34.517
We're all here for you.

12:34.518 --> 12:36.661
So we're all responsible.

12:36.662 --> 12:39.188
No matter how busy it gets,
Jessica is the priority.

12:41.575 --> 12:44.026
Right. Good.

12:44.027 --> 12:45.653
The post-op labs.

12:45.654 --> 12:47.413
- I got to check to see if they're back.
- Yep.

12:47.414 --> 12:48.581
I'm on them.

12:48.582 --> 12:50.083
You stay here with Jessica.

12:50.084 --> 12:52.535
We'll all be here as much as we can.

12:52.536 --> 12:54.720
You're gonna be sick
of seeing our faces.

12:56.137 --> 12:57.470
Thank you.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.100
Both of you.

13:16.202 --> 13:17.451
Can I help you?

13:18.871 --> 13:20.913
You must be Dr. Bell.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.542
Yeah, that's the name on the door.

13:24.543 --> 13:25.710
You are?

13:25.711 --> 13:28.713
Logan Kim. Exec VP of Red Rock.

13:28.714 --> 13:30.239
You left a message with my office.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.032
I left a message with Emma O'Neil.

13:32.033 --> 13:34.560
Emma is head of Red
Rock's transition team.

13:34.561 --> 13:35.870
Transition's over.

13:35.871 --> 13:38.247
I'll be overseeing the
day-to-day operations

13:38.248 --> 13:40.800
of the hospital now.

13:40.801 --> 13:42.918
I oversee the day-to-day.

13:42.919 --> 13:44.853
It's a partnership.

13:44.854 --> 13:46.472
No.

13:46.473 --> 13:48.880
We have distinct duties.

13:48.881 --> 13:52.052
You make payroll. I'm CEO.

13:52.053 --> 13:56.407
Let-Let's avoid a-a
pissing contest, shall we?

13:58.744 --> 14:01.044
Sorry. Yeah.

14:01.045 --> 14:03.729
Um... we've had a rough morning.

14:03.730 --> 14:05.566
One of our best nurses
fell asleep at the wheel,

14:05.567 --> 14:07.585
and her life is hanging
by a thread. She's...

14:07.586 --> 14:11.164
she's working double shifts
due to our nursing shortage.

14:11.165 --> 14:13.949
Let's-let's walk that
back, uh, immediately.

14:13.950 --> 14:17.077
A single car accident doesn't
mean that she was asleep

14:17.078 --> 14:19.001
at the wheel. Could have
been a suicide attempt.

14:19.002 --> 14:20.673
Maybe she was texting.

14:20.674 --> 14:23.751
Well, when she wakes up, we'll...

14:23.752 --> 14:25.419
Well, if she wakes up. If she doesn't,

14:25.420 --> 14:27.272
we may never know for sure.

14:27.273 --> 14:29.356
Did PR feed you that?

14:30.776 --> 14:32.685
I know exactly what happened.

14:32.686 --> 14:35.328
She was overworked. She was exhausted.

14:35.329 --> 14:36.909
She had a long drive home,

14:36.910 --> 14:38.269
and she fell asleep at the wheel.

14:38.270 --> 14:41.718
You could spin it that way,
which might lead the press

14:41.719 --> 14:43.844
to investigate other
overworked employees,

14:43.845 --> 14:46.941
like a resident who fell through
a skylight on your watch.

14:46.942 --> 14:49.535
I-I'm not pointing any fingers,
and I hope no one else will,

14:49.536 --> 14:53.631
but one CEO could easily be made
a scapegoat for both incidents.

14:53.632 --> 14:54.823
Are you threatening me?

14:54.824 --> 14:56.301
Absolutely not.

14:56.302 --> 14:58.158
But I'm trying to make you see

14:58.159 --> 14:59.568
how much smoother things will run

14:59.569 --> 15:02.790
if we're both playing for the same team:

15:02.791 --> 15:06.226
the shareholders of Red
Rock Mountain Medical.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.107
Anything?

15:13.652 --> 15:15.487
Post-op blood tests aren't back yet.

15:15.488 --> 15:18.197
Yeah. Come on.

15:27.938 --> 15:30.539
I take it all that optimism
was for Irving's sake.

15:32.171 --> 15:34.154
I'm scared to death.

15:34.155 --> 15:35.915
For both of them.

15:35.916 --> 15:37.917
If something happens to her...

15:37.918 --> 15:39.426
Don't even say it.

15:42.998 --> 15:45.766
If it had been you, I would be...

15:48.162 --> 15:50.963
- I have no idea what I'd be.
- Hey.

16:00.015 --> 16:02.574
I'm fine. Okay?

16:04.394 --> 16:06.520
But we have to do something.

16:06.521 --> 16:08.281
This is on Red Rock.

16:08.282 --> 16:09.690
Jessica was overworked.

16:09.691 --> 16:11.692
We're all overworked.

16:11.693 --> 16:13.681
It's this system. It's not right.

16:13.682 --> 16:14.787
What do you want to do?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.791
Today,

16:18.792 --> 16:20.743
we focus on Jessica.

16:20.744 --> 16:22.128
We make sure she's okay.

16:22.129 --> 16:24.538
We make sure Irving's
okay. But tomorrow?

16:24.539 --> 16:26.057
Tomorrow we keep fighting.

16:29.252 --> 16:30.895
Oh, sorry.

16:30.896 --> 16:33.472
I was just looking for an extra pillow.

16:33.473 --> 16:35.257
Jessica.

16:35.258 --> 16:37.476
Top shelf, Dad.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.269
Yeah. Sorry.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.109
Why don't you figure this out.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.750
- Look at the...
- I-I'm sorry, sir.

16:52.751 --> 16:55.262
- I don't know anything about the TV.
- I'm gonna take this to 921.

16:55.263 --> 16:56.570
Hey.

16:56.571 --> 16:59.907
Hey! Hey, how do you... how
do you change the channel?

16:59.908 --> 17:01.575
Because the-the TV's just showing birds.

17:01.576 --> 17:03.577
Well, that's a nature channel. I think

17:03.578 --> 17:05.454
- it's meant to keep you calm.
- Yeah, well-well,

17:05.454 --> 17:07.598
I hate birds, and it's driving me crazy.

17:10.126 --> 17:12.961
Uh, see, I'll just, uh...

17:12.962 --> 17:15.013
I'll just...

17:15.015 --> 17:17.132
I'll get a new one.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.942
Thank you.

17:22.034 --> 17:24.560
Her ICP has been increasing
over the last few hours.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.934
We need to get her back into
surgery to control the swelling.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.786
Well, she's still recovering
from the last surgery.

17:28.787 --> 17:30.479
I'd advise we go forward
with nonsurgical care

17:30.480 --> 17:32.608
- while she's still fragile.
- We've already been doing that.

17:32.609 --> 17:34.650
Medical management is not cutting it.

17:34.651 --> 17:36.332
We need to move on to surgical options.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.484
Now, you want her to have
irreversible brain damage?

17:38.485 --> 17:40.049
Hey. A little sensitivity.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.950
The next step is a
decompressive hemicraniectomy.

17:42.951 --> 17:45.211
Temporarily pop off a piece of her skull

17:45.212 --> 17:47.138
and allow her brain room to expand.

17:47.139 --> 17:49.164
She's febrile.

17:49.165 --> 17:50.833
In renal failure.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.960
And have you seen her post-op CBC?

17:52.961 --> 17:54.962
Her platelets are critically low,

17:54.963 --> 17:56.889
which makes a craniectomy far riskier.

17:56.890 --> 18:00.059
I think we still have time left
to optimize her the best we can

18:00.060 --> 18:01.894
before going back in
for another surgery.

18:01.895 --> 18:04.322
All right, so, everyone listen
to the third-year resident

18:04.323 --> 18:06.014
and follow him anywhere.

18:06.015 --> 18:08.762
- I'm the attending.
- I'm also the attending,

18:08.763 --> 18:10.853
and Irving asked Conrad
to coordinate care.

18:10.854 --> 18:13.239
All right, so why don't we
just go find the nursing student

18:13.240 --> 18:14.481
who's been bumbling
around the floor somewhere?

18:14.482 --> 18:15.974
Maybe she would like a say, as well.

18:15.975 --> 18:17.192
Conrad has the last word.

18:17.193 --> 18:19.219
Right, Irving? He's making the call.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.246
Let's get this straight.

18:20.247 --> 18:21.580
I'm a neurosurgeon.

18:21.581 --> 18:24.940
This woman is in need of neurosurgery.

18:24.941 --> 18:27.679
If her brain continues to
swell, she's gonna herniate.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.388
She's either gonna die
or have zero chances

18:30.389 --> 18:32.708
of waking up tomorrow
as anything more than...

18:32.709 --> 18:34.543
why don't we all say
this one together...

18:34.544 --> 18:36.837
a vegetable.

18:36.838 --> 18:40.279
We can place her in a barbiturate coma.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.480
That'll give us a chance
to control the swelling

18:42.481 --> 18:44.440
while she recovers from
the trauma of the surgery

18:44.441 --> 18:45.588
she just went through.

18:45.589 --> 18:47.604
Look, we've all been
here before in medicine

18:47.605 --> 18:49.119
where there is no clear-cut answer.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.445
- We need to work together...
- Now an intern speaks. Really?

18:52.446 --> 18:54.287
Why don't we just poll all of Atlanta.

18:54.288 --> 18:56.122
Maybe everyone should
have a voice at Chastain.

18:56.123 --> 18:57.691
Jessica's only in this
situation because you

18:57.692 --> 18:59.133
- overworked her for weeks.
- Oh, right.

18:59.134 --> 19:00.569
So now I'm responsible for a nurse

19:00.570 --> 19:02.547
who didn't know enough to call an Uber.

19:02.548 --> 19:05.124
No. But you will be responsible

19:05.125 --> 19:07.868
if she arrests on the table
because her body can't handle

19:07.869 --> 19:09.094
another invasive surgery.

19:11.578 --> 19:13.237
Conrad makes this call.

19:15.227 --> 19:17.803
Some medical proxy you are.

19:17.804 --> 19:20.306
When she dies,

19:20.307 --> 19:22.366
it's gonna be on you.

19:41.768 --> 19:44.446
Look, I didn't want to
contradict you in front of Cain,

19:44.447 --> 19:47.074
but I'm not 100% about
waiting to address

19:47.075 --> 19:48.242
Jessica's intracranial pressure.

19:48.243 --> 19:49.988
I know. I feel the same way.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.865
But it is a judgment call,
and I don't want to send her

19:51.866 --> 19:54.006
back to the OR with a
dropping platelet count

19:54.007 --> 19:56.175
that we can't explain when
there are other medical options.

19:56.176 --> 19:57.517
Are you sure that continuing

19:57.518 --> 19:59.292
with conservative management
is gonna help her ICP?

19:59.293 --> 20:01.105
It's worth a try,
particularly in this case.

20:01.106 --> 20:02.769
If she doesn't clot
in surgery, she dies.

20:02.770 --> 20:03.799
Okay, I'm on board.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.685
But a word of caution.

20:06.686 --> 20:09.805
You know Cain has the
juice with Red Rock, right?

20:09.806 --> 20:11.974
You know he is their
cash register, Hawkins.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.601
I am well aware. Since he came here,

20:14.602 --> 20:17.288
invasive brain and spine
surgeries are up 49%.

20:17.289 --> 20:19.671
Now, you ask yourself, how
many of those are necessary?

20:19.672 --> 20:21.817
Cain cuts when no one else would.

20:21.818 --> 20:24.987
So, you think he might be
doing it again with Jessica?

20:24.988 --> 20:28.156
I think he's a cowboy.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.875
I love surgeons with attitude

20:29.876 --> 20:31.877
- and even a healthy ego.
- Hmm.

20:31.878 --> 20:34.830
If they put patients first, like you do.

20:34.831 --> 20:36.623
Well, I don't mind
residents with cojones.

20:36.624 --> 20:38.476
But you tread lightly.

20:38.477 --> 20:41.102
You just made a dangerous enemy.

20:50.113 --> 20:51.656
How-how about bald

20:51.657 --> 20:53.307
but still banging with the best of them.

20:53.308 --> 20:54.502
Hey, Nic.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.243
Hi. Uh, this is my daughter.

20:56.244 --> 20:58.803
She's a nurse practitioner
here. Nic, this is Jackie,

20:58.804 --> 21:01.031
a 70-year-old woman with
congestive heart failure

21:01.032 --> 21:02.357
here for IV diuretics,

21:02.358 --> 21:05.138
which requires monitoring
throughout the day.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.246
Well done, Dad, but I know.
Jackie's my patient.

21:07.247 --> 21:08.864
Did you know that Jackie

21:08.865 --> 21:10.991
and her daughter Leslie here
have a business together?

21:10.992 --> 21:13.994
They cross-stitch pillows
with risqué phrases on them.

21:13.995 --> 21:16.018
- Mm, I did not.
- Did you know that?

21:16.019 --> 21:18.373
- I did not. I need one of those.
- Oh.

21:18.374 --> 21:20.518
- Um, did you get Jackie's lunch?
- Uh...

21:20.519 --> 21:22.836
I came to take her
order. We got to talking.

21:22.837 --> 21:24.430
I'm-I'm on it.

21:27.216 --> 21:29.026
Uh, does he like older women?

21:29.027 --> 21:30.177
Mom.

21:30.178 --> 21:32.054
What? He's adorable.

21:32.055 --> 21:35.015
Okay, this isn't the bar.

21:35.016 --> 21:37.534
This is Clara. She'll be
starting your IV today.

21:38.871 --> 21:40.446
Have you ever done this before?

21:40.447 --> 21:42.206
On a, uh, mannequin.

21:42.207 --> 21:44.900
But I always won when
we did IV races in class.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.693
- Clara's in training.
- Ow.

21:46.694 --> 21:48.070
Nic, she's gonna kill me.

21:48.071 --> 21:49.146
She's not gonna kill you.

21:49.147 --> 21:50.238
Listen to your patient.

21:50.239 --> 21:51.798
The band's too tight.

22:01.468 --> 22:02.968
Got it.

22:02.969 --> 22:04.378
Oh, pro tip, girlie.

22:04.379 --> 22:07.272
Real people feel more
pain than mannequins.

22:11.686 --> 22:12.761
She's stable.

22:12.762 --> 22:13.762
She's resting.

22:13.763 --> 22:15.314
Buddy, you need to eat something.

22:15.315 --> 22:17.650
- I'm not leaving her.
- You need to take care of yourself

22:17.651 --> 22:19.197
in order to take care of Jessica.

22:19.198 --> 22:20.885
Come to the cafeteria.
We're gonna get you some food.

22:20.886 --> 22:22.896
Conrad ordered more labs. I'm
waiting until they come back.

22:22.897 --> 22:24.287
They're not gonna be
back for another hour.

22:24.288 --> 22:25.882
Come on. It's tri-tip sandwich day.

22:25.883 --> 22:27.251
You love tri-tip sandwich day.

22:27.252 --> 22:29.328
I'm not hungry.

22:29.329 --> 22:30.779
You need to eat anyway.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.114
Don't make us drag you.

22:32.115 --> 22:35.334
Dr. Feldman.

22:35.335 --> 22:36.952
I'd like to spend a few
minutes with Jessica,

22:36.953 --> 22:38.029
if that's all right.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.413
See?

22:39.414 --> 22:41.098
She's not gonna be alone.

22:41.099 --> 22:43.391
Everyone loves her.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.294
I think she'd be honored, Dr. Bell.

22:46.295 --> 22:47.615
I know how much she respects you.

22:52.468 --> 22:54.402
All right.

23:09.461 --> 23:10.877
Hey.

23:22.975 --> 23:25.392
What can I get you, Dr. Feldman?

23:28.403 --> 23:29.978
Uh, his usual.

23:29.979 --> 23:31.481
Tri-tip sandwich coming up.

23:32.675 --> 23:34.676
You don't look so good.

23:34.677 --> 23:35.802
Go sit.

23:35.803 --> 23:37.862
Grab that free table, okay?

23:40.693 --> 23:43.336
We may need to get a social
worker to come talk to him.

23:44.496 --> 23:46.813
Get him something for his anxiety.

23:46.814 --> 23:49.500
He needs to keep a clear head.

23:49.501 --> 23:50.835
Let's get some food in him.

23:50.836 --> 23:52.336
We're out of tri-tip.

23:52.337 --> 23:54.079
Tuna salad?

23:54.080 --> 23:57.082
It's tri-tip day.

23:57.083 --> 24:00.678
The man needs a tri-tip sandwich.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.370
He doesn't like tuna salad.

24:02.371 --> 24:03.922
Do you understand?

24:03.923 --> 24:06.766
So go back there and get some tri-tip!

24:11.339 --> 24:13.273
We're all having a bad day.

24:16.028 --> 24:17.719
That was uncalled for.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.887
I'm sorry.

24:18.888 --> 24:20.347
It's okay.

24:20.348 --> 24:22.700
I heard about Jessica.

24:22.701 --> 24:24.035
I understand.

24:24.036 --> 24:26.870
We're all in it together.

24:35.696 --> 24:37.239
What's going on?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.407
Got more labs back.

24:39.408 --> 24:41.067
Platelets are still falling,

24:41.068 --> 24:43.258
and now she's anemic, so I paged Austin.

24:43.259 --> 24:44.889
That doesn't make any sense.

24:44.890 --> 24:47.818
She's gotten over 20 units PRBCs,

24:47.819 --> 24:50.097
15 FFPs, ten units of platelets...

24:50.098 --> 24:51.378
Yeah, well, you better keep 'em coming.

24:51.379 --> 24:52.471
You think she's still bleeding?

24:52.472 --> 24:53.826
I don't see anything in her chest.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.237
Her belly's nice and soft.

24:55.238 --> 24:56.641
Well, where's all the blood going?

24:58.144 --> 24:59.886
We're working on that.

24:59.887 --> 25:02.147
You're sure you didn't
miss a bleed somewhere?

25:02.148 --> 25:04.469
Maybe the retroperitoneum
or pleural cavities?

25:04.470 --> 25:05.620
No, I didn't miss anything.

25:05.621 --> 25:07.912
You can't know that. Maybe, this time,

25:07.913 --> 25:10.050
you missed something and that's
why Jessica's still too sick

25:10.051 --> 25:11.865
for surgery. And now
she's running out of time.

25:11.866 --> 25:14.085
Hey. Remember, we are on the same side.

25:14.086 --> 25:17.112
I'll take her for another CT,

25:17.113 --> 25:19.541
just to make sure we're
not missing anything.

25:19.542 --> 25:22.000
I didn't miss anything.

25:22.001 --> 25:24.911
But let's get another
CT, so we can be certain.

25:24.912 --> 25:26.764
I'm sorry I left you, babe.

25:26.765 --> 25:28.807
I'm sorry.

25:40.779 --> 25:43.321
What's going on?

25:44.449 --> 25:46.117
She's still anemic

25:46.118 --> 25:49.167
and thrombocytopenic despite
multiple transfusions.

25:49.168 --> 25:51.288
- Why?
- I'm working on it.

25:53.649 --> 25:55.868
Honestly, I don't know.

25:55.869 --> 25:57.319
There's nothing on the CT?

25:57.320 --> 25:58.820
No.

26:04.452 --> 26:06.303
I called the CEO of DiaCure.

26:06.304 --> 26:07.954
We made a deal.

26:07.955 --> 26:11.182
We're gonna use their
dialysis equipment exclusively.

26:13.812 --> 26:16.563
You can get the data you need.

26:17.482 --> 26:19.466
I-I just, uh...

26:19.467 --> 26:22.193
just felt like I had to
do something positive.

26:24.513 --> 26:28.233
J-Jessica's...

26:28.234 --> 26:32.871
She's my favorite of the OR nurses.

26:32.872 --> 26:34.314
You know, she's a... she's a pistol.

26:34.315 --> 26:37.817
You know. And...

26:37.818 --> 26:40.746
sweet.

26:40.747 --> 26:42.922
And a lady.

26:46.702 --> 26:49.345
So this one's for her.

26:52.684 --> 26:56.169
Wish it were more.

26:56.170 --> 26:58.479
It's all I got.

27:00.508 --> 27:02.567
Thank you.

27:08.003 --> 27:10.153
Your dressing needs to be changed.

27:10.154 --> 27:11.559
Get me a real nurse.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.061
He's been picking at his cellulitis.

27:13.062 --> 27:15.113
Yeah, bec... I can't help
it, because it itches.

27:15.114 --> 27:16.927
All right? So why don't...
why don't you give me something

27:16.928 --> 27:18.411
in-instead of getting in my face?

27:18.412 --> 27:20.193
That sounds like drug
seeking to me, and...

27:20.194 --> 27:22.404
- Sir, you can't-can't do that.
- Steve.

27:22.405 --> 27:23.422
Sir.

27:23.423 --> 27:25.216
- Sir...
- You need to get back in bed. Hey, hey.

27:25.217 --> 27:27.218
Steve, come on.
You got to get back in bed.

27:27.219 --> 27:29.939
Nic!

27:29.940 --> 27:31.913
The meth head is trying
to kill your father!

27:31.914 --> 27:33.748
The meth head is trying
to kill your father!

27:33.749 --> 27:35.875
Help! Hey, hey, hey!

27:39.006 --> 27:40.714
Code gray!

27:44.477 --> 27:46.570
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:46.571 --> 27:48.763
- Ow! Oh!
- Hey! Hey!

27:48.764 --> 27:50.557
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

27:50.558 --> 27:52.267
Hold him down!

27:52.268 --> 27:53.601
Let go of me!

27:57.323 --> 27:59.274
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah. He bit me.

27:59.275 --> 28:00.734
Is that bad?

28:00.735 --> 28:02.361
He didn't break the skin,
but we'll take a look at it,

28:02.362 --> 28:05.497
just in case.

28:05.498 --> 28:07.340
- It's okay.
- Oh, it's a good...

28:07.341 --> 28:09.860
it was a good thing I was here.
Right place at the right time.

28:09.861 --> 28:12.429
He could've hurt... uh, Clara.

28:12.430 --> 28:15.148
Clara, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have left you alone.

28:15.149 --> 28:16.174
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

28:16.175 --> 28:17.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:17.251 --> 28:18.585
Ooh, ooh.

28:18.586 --> 28:20.512
He s-spit on me.

28:20.513 --> 28:23.022
Oh, God.

28:33.526 --> 28:34.768
You okay?

28:34.769 --> 28:36.787
Yeah, it's fine. I'm fine.

28:36.788 --> 28:39.698
It's okay not to be fine.

28:39.699 --> 28:41.983
Nursing school doesn't prepare
you for a day like this.

28:41.984 --> 28:42.984
I quit.

28:52.378 --> 28:53.378
You can't.

28:53.379 --> 28:55.121
I'm sorry.

28:55.122 --> 28:58.666
I'm short of nurses, and I
need everybody that I can get.

29:00.836 --> 29:03.296
Plus...

29:03.297 --> 29:04.890
you can do this.

29:04.891 --> 29:06.725
I don't want to.

29:06.726 --> 29:09.486
I mean...

29:09.487 --> 29:12.806
it was one thing when it was on paper.

29:12.807 --> 29:16.207
What are the warning
signs of heart failure?

29:16.208 --> 29:18.019
How many milliliters?

29:19.121 --> 29:21.029
I liked studying medicine.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.240
But when it comes to this...

29:22.241 --> 29:26.170
Look, you've had a seriously
difficult first day.

29:26.171 --> 29:29.030
But, hey, at least no
one threw up on you.

29:29.031 --> 29:31.199
No one pulled a chunk
of hair out of your head.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.659
That happened to you?

29:32.660 --> 29:34.252
First day.

29:34.253 --> 29:36.929
God, why do you do this?

29:38.257 --> 29:41.259
Look, we don't have to
like all of our patients.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.503
But we do have to take care of them.

29:43.504 --> 29:45.764
Because, whoever they are,

29:45.765 --> 29:48.359
they're sick and in pain.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.052
And it's our job to deal with it.

29:51.053 --> 29:54.347
And sometimes, yes, it is so hard.

29:54.348 --> 29:56.441
But...

29:56.442 --> 30:00.871
not many people get a
chance to make a difference.

30:00.872 --> 30:03.207
A good nurse can.

30:05.901 --> 30:08.286
You've invested...

30:08.287 --> 30:10.572
two years in this?

30:10.573 --> 30:13.125
Student debt, I imagine?

30:13.126 --> 30:16.294
You can always quit on your second day.

30:17.296 --> 30:19.873
Come on.

30:19.874 --> 30:21.224
You got this. Let's go.

30:25.584 --> 30:27.700
You figure out what's going
on with her blood counts?

30:27.701 --> 30:29.537
- No.
- Her ICP keeps going up.

30:29.538 --> 30:31.217
We don't have any more time.

30:31.218 --> 30:33.305
You delayed this surgery
for no good reason.

30:33.306 --> 30:34.414
You failed.

30:34.415 --> 30:35.739
Self-important neophyte,

30:35.740 --> 30:37.508
you don't even know
how much you don't know.

30:37.509 --> 30:39.434
I'm gonna remove the
pressure from her brain

30:39.435 --> 30:41.561
and hope it's not too
late. So, congratulations.

30:41.562 --> 30:44.497
Your narcissism almost
killed your patient.

30:53.782 --> 30:55.758
Saw to me.

31:05.496 --> 31:07.187
Are you sure you're okay to be here?

31:07.188 --> 31:08.930
This is the last place
on earth I want to be,

31:08.931 --> 31:10.189
and I won't be anywhere else.

31:25.606 --> 31:26.873
Scalpel.

31:32.655 --> 31:35.466
Lap pads. Cautery.

31:35.467 --> 31:37.507
- There's too much blood.
- Get suction in, damn it.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.719
Suction.

31:41.380 --> 31:42.806
Oh, my God. No.

31:42.807 --> 31:45.809
This is exactly what
Conrad said would happen.

31:45.810 --> 31:47.682
Why isn't she clotting?

31:48.471 --> 31:51.493
Hey, man, we didn't
have a choice anymore.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.260
When you wait too long, her brain swells

31:53.261 --> 31:55.190
and she dies. You go back in there

31:55.191 --> 31:58.155
without correcting her
coagulopathy, she bleeds out.

31:58.156 --> 31:59.847
It was my job to figure it out.

31:59.848 --> 32:01.407
Maybe we still can.

32:02.994 --> 32:05.019
Let's work on the differential.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.454
Together.

32:07.481 --> 32:08.839
Okay.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.742
All right, she's bleeding.
It won't stop.

32:11.743 --> 32:12.819
Why?

32:12.820 --> 32:14.097
And where does the blood go?

32:14.098 --> 32:15.391
Into the body or onto the floor.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.483
In this case, neither.

32:16.484 --> 32:18.669
Jessica's not losing platelets.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.233
Her body is destroying them.

32:20.234 --> 32:22.662
Hemolysis, low platelets,

32:22.663 --> 32:24.372
renal dysfunction, fever.

32:24.373 --> 32:26.499
- It's got to be TTP.
- Oh, God.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.835
If she has TTP, her platelet
count will just keep dropping.

32:28.836 --> 32:30.448
She'll never clot.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.089
This surgery is going to kill her,

32:32.090 --> 32:33.840
and I gave the okay to go ahead with it.

32:33.841 --> 32:35.732
Now that we know what it is,

32:35.733 --> 32:37.132
we can treat it.

32:37.133 --> 32:39.284
So you're gonna start plasmapheresis

32:39.285 --> 32:40.296
while she's in surgery?

32:43.896 --> 32:45.979
Hell yeah, he is.

32:48.906 --> 32:50.448
Move faster. Get that bleeder.

32:50.449 --> 32:53.067
I'm moving as fast as I
can. It's oozing everywhere.

32:53.068 --> 32:54.228
Keep hanging those platelets.

32:55.621 --> 32:57.669
Get out of my OR! Now!

32:59.717 --> 33:01.218
I'm chief of surgery.

33:01.219 --> 33:03.744
Every OR in Chastain is my OR.

33:03.745 --> 33:04.796
Hawkins stays.

33:04.797 --> 33:07.186
- What's happening?
- Jessica has TTP.

33:07.187 --> 33:09.682
- Giving her more platelets won't help.
- Scrub nurse, ignore him.

33:09.683 --> 33:12.587
- I need you with me on this cautery.
- All you.

33:12.588 --> 33:15.006
- Conrad, I'll get access.
- Thank you.

33:15.007 --> 33:16.933
You can do that plasmapheresis
when I'm done.

33:19.737 --> 33:21.558
You have no idea even if you're right,

33:21.559 --> 33:23.517
let alone if it's gonna help.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.803
Okay, now we can cauterize.

33:39.665 --> 33:41.258
Now she has a chance.

33:49.767 --> 33:53.086
Dr. Bell, just wanted
to congratulate you.

33:53.087 --> 33:54.629
What for?

33:54.630 --> 33:56.846
Heard you made a very
lucrative deal today.

33:56.847 --> 33:58.907
- DiaCure Dialysis Centers.
- Yeah.

33:58.908 --> 34:00.944
They gave us a great
price for exclusivity.

34:00.945 --> 34:03.805
That deserves an "attaboy"
from the new veep.

34:03.806 --> 34:06.508
What kind of kickback did
they offer us for the contract?

34:06.509 --> 34:09.643
Some data we required
for patient safety,

34:09.645 --> 34:11.938
and they committed to help
us with the money we need

34:11.938 --> 34:13.606
- to fill out our nursing staff.
- Whoa.

34:13.607 --> 34:15.626
Punching above your weight there.

34:15.627 --> 34:17.472
I'll make the call on
where the money goes.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.777
I'm thinking Neuro.

34:18.779 --> 34:20.947
Barrett's got a laundry
list of line items.

34:20.947 --> 34:22.489
Barrett?

34:22.491 --> 34:24.759
You on a first-name basis with Dr. Cain?

34:24.760 --> 34:27.120
We go way back. He's the
one who got me this job.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.639
Lured me away from a hedge
fund on the West Coast.

34:31.809 --> 34:34.668
You have no background in health care.

34:34.670 --> 34:37.897
I have a background... in profits.

34:39.842 --> 34:42.009
Well, this profit goes for more nurses.

34:42.010 --> 34:44.126
It's... it's part of the agreement.

34:44.127 --> 34:45.185
It can't be undone.

34:46.824 --> 34:49.699
No more deals like this
again without my input.

35:01.195 --> 35:03.845
Hey. I'm just gonna change the dressing.

35:07.202 --> 35:09.887
All right, let's see what we have.

35:19.691 --> 35:23.435
There isn't very much
blood around the incision.

35:23.436 --> 35:24.777
It's starting to clot.

35:26.439 --> 35:28.030
We'll get another CBC.

35:30.776 --> 35:33.945
Yeah, well, we can send it
in, but this is good news.

35:33.946 --> 35:36.039
The plasmapheresis is working.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.666
She still might not wake up.

35:39.877 --> 35:42.287
And if she does,

35:42.288 --> 35:44.548
we have no idea what kind
of shape she'll be in.

35:44.549 --> 35:47.550
We'll know more in 24 hours.

35:58.086 --> 36:02.381
- Hey, Dad, wait.
- Oh, Nic. I just finished my shift.

36:02.382 --> 36:05.426
- You need something?
- Look, um...

36:05.427 --> 36:07.237
Thanks for being here today.

36:08.722 --> 36:10.489
I love volunteering.

36:13.986 --> 36:17.062
I know you were scared that
it was me when you heard

36:17.063 --> 36:19.022
about the accident this morning.

36:19.976 --> 36:21.518
I brushed you off.

36:21.519 --> 36:23.520
I'm sorry I did that.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.801
You're all I got, kid.

36:40.179 --> 36:41.979
We're Team Nevin now.

37:04.370 --> 37:06.962
Still no change in Jessica.

37:11.118 --> 37:12.384
What's this?

37:14.138 --> 37:16.381
DiaCure records.

37:16.382 --> 37:19.125
You got them.

37:19.126 --> 37:20.309
Yeah.

37:21.837 --> 37:23.671
It's worse than we thought.

37:23.672 --> 37:26.649
20% higher complication
rate with Hemopleatin.

37:28.319 --> 37:29.652
Look at all these PEs.

37:31.897 --> 37:34.324
This drug is probably
what killed Jessie.

37:34.325 --> 37:35.975
I think so.

37:37.736 --> 37:40.663
What do you think the next step is?

37:42.443 --> 37:44.393
Tomorrow I go in to
see Bell and Red Rock,

37:44.394 --> 37:46.244
and get this drug
pulled off the shelves.

37:46.245 --> 37:48.413
Permanently.

37:48.414 --> 37:51.430
You know how dangerous that is, Conrad?

37:51.431 --> 37:53.306
Big Pharma is ruthless.

37:53.307 --> 37:54.827
They could go after you.

37:54.828 --> 37:57.371
They always like to
discredit the messenger.

37:57.372 --> 37:58.682
The numbers don't lie.

37:58.683 --> 38:00.258
We'll make sure what happened to Jessie

38:00.259 --> 38:02.059
doesn't happen to anyone else.

38:05.005 --> 38:07.064
Her death could save lives.

38:18.536 --> 38:21.745
As awful as this is, I
learned something today.

38:25.359 --> 38:27.785
I really love her.

38:27.786 --> 38:29.621
I don't think I realized how much

38:29.622 --> 38:31.463
until I thought I might lose her.

38:36.036 --> 38:40.097
If she comes back to me, I'll tell her.

38:43.561 --> 38:46.103
Please come back to me.

38:47.899 --> 38:50.925
We all see how much you
guys love each other.

38:50.926 --> 38:52.718
You know, I beat myself up

38:52.719 --> 38:54.929
about leaving Priya at the altar.

38:54.930 --> 38:58.650
But now I know it was right.

38:58.651 --> 39:03.154
Because what we had... it wasn't this.

39:03.155 --> 39:06.422
Don't make this about you, Pravesh.

39:07.734 --> 39:08.734
Hey.

39:11.830 --> 39:13.422
Thank you.

39:14.741 --> 39:16.075
Oh!

39:16.076 --> 39:17.761
- Um, okay.
- It's happening.

39:17.762 --> 39:19.262
Give into it.

39:19.263 --> 39:21.455
- Oh, that's tight. But...
- Yeah.

39:21.456 --> 39:23.675
Come on. There you go.

39:23.676 --> 39:24.767
Oh, buddy.

39:28.922 --> 39:32.350
Hmm, you're certain you have
enough patient information

39:32.351 --> 39:36.762
to prove that Hemopleatin
is causing sudden death

39:36.763 --> 39:38.472
in a significant number of patients?

39:38.473 --> 39:39.950
Yes.

39:39.951 --> 39:42.818
We need to pull it immediately
and warn the FDA.

39:42.819 --> 39:45.271
No, I've looked over the
data; Dr. Hawkins is right.

39:45.272 --> 39:48.124
The complication rate is off the charts.

39:48.125 --> 39:50.794
I'll-I'll have my people
go over the figures,

39:50.795 --> 39:52.462
and if this checks out,

39:52.463 --> 39:55.448
we'll use it to make a PR splash.

39:55.449 --> 39:59.135
Chastain catches a deadly drug

39:59.136 --> 40:01.287
- and saves patients.
- And in the meantime,

40:01.288 --> 40:04.290
we can go back to using an older
drug that we know to be safe.

40:04.291 --> 40:06.000
And, more good news,
it's actually cheaper.

40:06.001 --> 40:09.554
Well, that's a huge win on all fronts.

40:09.555 --> 40:12.339
- Really nice work.
- All right.

40:12.340 --> 40:13.649
Thank you.

40:14.652 --> 40:16.394
That info...

40:16.395 --> 40:19.897
was part of the DiaCure deal.

40:19.898 --> 40:21.640
So you helped him?

40:21.641 --> 40:23.401
Yeah. Yeah.

40:23.402 --> 40:26.912
But I'm happy to let the
hospital take the credit.

40:28.982 --> 40:31.875
Okay.

40:55.541 --> 40:56.891
Wake up.

40:59.554 --> 41:00.721
Me or her?

41:00.722 --> 41:02.056
Both, I think.

41:02.057 --> 41:04.275
- Mm.
- Jess? Honey?

41:04.276 --> 41:05.702
- Jess?
- Mm.

41:05.703 --> 41:08.020
Can you hear me?

41:08.021 --> 41:09.057
Mm.

41:09.058 --> 41:10.373
- Can you hear me?
- Hey. Hey.

41:10.374 --> 41:12.542
- Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Careful, careful.

41:12.543 --> 41:13.901
Shh, shh. No, don't do that.

41:13.902 --> 41:15.402
- You're okay. Hey.
- Hey, Jess.

41:15.403 --> 41:16.788
Honey.

41:16.789 --> 41:18.122
Hey. You're okay.

41:18.123 --> 41:19.631
You're fine. You're fine.

41:21.701 --> 41:25.804
It's a long story, but
everything's gonna be just fine.

41:31.062 --> 41:34.397
Okay. Here we go. Here we go.

41:34.398 --> 41:36.396
You could use some vittles in ya.

41:36.397 --> 41:37.475
All right. I'll eat now.

41:37.476 --> 41:40.036
- This is a mess.
- Do the honors.

41:40.037 --> 41:41.813
- This looks good.
- Yeah, this is not from the cafeteria.

41:41.814 --> 41:43.788
Okay, I want the
little baby one over here.

41:43.789 --> 41:45.724
I heard the good news.

41:45.725 --> 41:48.702
- Dr. Hawkins, a word?
- Yeah, sure thing.

41:54.401 --> 41:57.570
I just want to say, I, uh,
appreciate what you did,

41:57.571 --> 41:59.664
and I actually regret that we had words.

41:59.665 --> 42:01.615
It-it was an emotional
day for all of us.

42:01.616 --> 42:04.335
No doubt. No doubt.

42:04.336 --> 42:06.887
But don't ever question
my decision again.

42:09.617 --> 42:11.826
Well, when I'm wrong,

42:11.827 --> 42:13.252
I've learned to listen to my colleagues.

42:13.253 --> 42:14.771
You're not a colleague.

42:14.772 --> 42:16.595
You're a subordinate
and I don't give a damn

42:16.596 --> 42:17.774
what your process is.

42:17.775 --> 42:19.817
You're not invincible, you know.

42:21.687 --> 42:23.946
No one is.

42:25.524 --> 42:27.199
You sure about that?

42:43.116 --> 42:44.716
We on the same page?

42:45.711 --> 42:47.912
You tell me.

42:47.913 --> 42:50.974
Hawkins is a whistleblower.

42:50.975 --> 42:55.311
My concern is him deciding
in his self-righteous way

42:55.312 --> 42:59.006
that Red Rock is doing
something he doesn't like.

42:59.007 --> 43:01.525
That's not something I can live with.

43:03.136 --> 43:04.570
Then there's our answer.

43:06.681 --> 43:08.907
He's a threat to the hospital.

43:10.068 --> 43:12.087
I'll handle it.
