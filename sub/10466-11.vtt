UPSIDE DOWN...

18:29.717 --> 18:31.980
THE BOW'S

18:31.980 --> 18:34.025
NO! YOU CAN'T
JUST...MOVE IT!

18:34.025 --> 18:36.202
THAT'LL LEAVE A TAPE MARK.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!

18:38.073 --> 18:39.422
I'M SORRY. IF
YOU'LL JUST LET ME--

18:39.422 --> 18:41.772
NO! NEVER MIND.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.774
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.950
THANK YOU FOR

18:45.950 --> 18:47.517
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.129
UH, WELCOME TO TAYLOR'S
COMPLIMENTARY GIFT WRAP.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.348
MAY I HELP YOU
SELECT A PRESENTATION?

18:52.348 --> 18:53.958
WHY WOULD
HE FIRE YOU?

18:53.958 --> 18:55.743
BECAUSE HE CAUGHT ME
SCHEDULING INTERVIEWS

18:55.743 --> 18:57.136
FOR MY ADJUSTER JOBS.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.573
HE WAS SUCH AN ASS
ABOUT IT.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.878
OK.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.185
JUST TRY NOT TO...

19:03.185 --> 19:04.969
MAYBE
THIS ISN'T THE END
OF THE WORLD.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.928
NO, I DON'T HAVE
AN INCOME, BAILEY.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
NO SAVINGS.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.452
NOTHING.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.106
NOTHING
BUT A 7-YEAR-OLD

19:11.106 --> 19:14.022
WHO IS ACTUALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO CHRISTMAS.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.371
OK, WELL, MAYBE
NOW YOU HAVE TIME

19:15.371 --> 19:16.851
TO GO ON INTERVIEWS
FOR OTHER JOBS.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.027
NOBODY'S HIRING
UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAYS,

19:19.027 --> 19:22.596
AND I NEED A PAYCHECK
WHILE I'M LOOKING.

19:22.596 --> 19:23.727
[SIGHS]

19:23.727 --> 19:24.728
OK, LOOK.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.687
MAYBE...

19:26.687 --> 19:28.036
MAYBE THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE...

19:28.036 --> 19:29.646
BLESSING-IN-DISGUISE
THINGS.

19:29.646 --> 19:30.604
OH, PLEASE.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.648
NO.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.868
THINK ABOUT IT.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.783
YEAH, IT'S
GONNA BE TIGHT FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

19:35.783 --> 19:38.089
BUT NOW YOU HAVE
A CHANCE TO GO LOOK
FOR A BETTER JOB.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.004
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

19:40.004 --> 19:44.052
THIS IS NOT LIKE
GETTING KICKED OUT
OF SOME CLASS, OK?

19:44.052 --> 19:46.097
OR GETTING A "C"
IN SOCIOLOGY.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.187
THIS IS MY LIFE HERE!

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
I KNOW THAT, ANNIE.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.843
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY
I'M TRYING TO HELP
YOU FIGURE OUT--

19:52.843 --> 19:54.802
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN'T.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.021
OK? BECAUSE YOU DON'T
EVEN UNDERSTAND.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.415
I MEAN, AND I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT, OK?

19:59.415 --> 20:01.069
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME
I LISTENED TO YOU,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.158
IT GOT ME INTO THIS MESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

20:03.158 --> 20:05.465
WAIT A MINUTE--NO, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOU PUSHING ME

20:05.465 --> 20:07.641
TO TAKE THAT TEST,
I WOULD STILL HAVE A JOB!

20:07.641 --> 20:09.077
WAIT A SECOND, ANNIE,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.122
JUST DO ME A FAVOR, OK?

20:11.122 --> 20:14.082
PLEASE, JUST GO PLAY
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.535
HEY, YOU'RE
JUST IN TIME.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.408
I'VE DRASTICALLY REDUCED
MY ENTIRE INVENTORY.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.105
GREAT.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.150
WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY COATS, WOULD YOU?

20:39.150 --> 20:41.196
YOU ARE IN SO MUCH LUCK.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.067
AND IS THERE
ANY PLACE TO EAT?

20:43.067 --> 20:45.244
WELL, THEY GOT
MAD COW BURGERS DOWN
BY THE INTERSTATE.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.549
IT'S ABOUT
2 HOURS AWAY.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.811
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS CLOSED,

20:47.811 --> 20:49.160
WHICH NOBODY
BOTHERED TO TELL ME

20:49.160 --> 20:50.684
WHEN I BOUGHT
THIS PLACE.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.033
HERE, TRY THAT.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.122
I HAVE A FEELING
IT'S YOU.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.472
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
IT'S NICE.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.300
UH, THE SEA,
PROBABLY,

20:58.300 --> 20:59.649
AND PIPE TOBACCO.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.477
IT WAS MY UNCLE'S.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.263
HE WAS A STEWARD
ON THE QUEEN MARY
OR SOMETHING.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.613
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE
KIND OF IN A HURRY,

21:06.613 --> 21:08.919
SO, UH...HOW MUCH
FOR THE COAT?

21:08.919 --> 21:10.834
OH, UH...

21:10.834 --> 21:14.273
5 BUCKS OUGHT TO DO IT.SOLD.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.753
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.
YOU BUY THE COAT,

21:16.753 --> 21:18.886
YOU HELP ME MOVE
ALL THIS JUNK INSIDE,

21:18.886 --> 21:21.018
AND YOU CAN BE
THE FIRST TO TRY
MY NEW LAMB STEW.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.064
THE B&amp;B ISN'T
REALLY TAKING OFF,

21:23.064 --> 21:25.893
SO I'M TRYING
TO MAKE A GO OF
THE RESTAURANT.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.112
REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.549
MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME POINTERS.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.202
WAIT A MINUTE. UH...

21:31.202 --> 21:34.945
THAT'S--THAT'S
SWEET, BUT... WE CAN'T.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.165
THIS TRIP IS ALREADY
OUT OF CONTROL,
CHARLIE.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.907
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS LIKE THE UNIVERSE
SPEAKING OR SOMETHING.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.343
WE'RE LOST, COLD,
AND HUNGRY,

21:41.343 --> 21:44.085
AND THE ANSWER
JUST FALLS IN OUR LAP?

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
COME ON,
HOW CAN WE SAY NO?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.134
ALL RIGHT.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.398
BUT AFTER THAT,
WE'RE GOING HOME.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.138

23:41.985 --> 23:44.988
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT I DID
WITH THOSE KEYS.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.512
UNLESS I DROPPED

24:51.577 --> 24:53.927
IT'S...

24:53.927 --> 24:54.928
NOTHING.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.669
IT'S NOTHING.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.323
I'LL GO MAKE UP A ROOM.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.530
I...I LOVE VANILLA.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.619
I'M THINKING
IT'S THE RUM.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.229
I DIDN'T PUT
ANY RUM IN THIS.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.101
NO, BUT THOSE GUYS DID.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.581
