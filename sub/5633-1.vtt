DR. HIBBERT:
<i>Yet again,</i>

01:15.176 --> 01:16.575
Homer will be fine.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.280
Mm. He's been sleeping
an awful lot.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.715
Look at these
vacation photos.

DR. HIBBERT: Oh, my!

01:25.519 --> 01:27.186

01:27.188 --> 01:30.089
Man, you people sure
take a lot of vacations.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.458
MARGE: That's just to remind me
where I parked.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.028
Hmm. I think I have an idea
of what might be going on.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.396

Huh? What?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.531

01:41.702 --> 01:43.202

Aren't you supposed
to give him anesthetic?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.940
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.280

01:56.382 --> 01:58.917
Oof. Very low levels
of hypocretin.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.386
I'm afraid Homer has...
narcolepsy.

02:01.388 --> 02:04.123
Doctor, is it time
to pull the plug on my father?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.492
No, wait. I'll spare you
that painful decision.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.127
HOMER: No, Bart!
That's the TV!

02:08.129 --> 02:09.728
Ha-ha!
That's the other guy.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.729
Stop that!

02:10.731 --> 02:11.930
(laughs)

02:11.932 --> 02:14.133
Narcolepsy's merely
sleeping sickness,

02:14.135 --> 02:15.968
and many narcoleptics
do lead normal lives

02:15.970 --> 02:18.170
by avoiding
stressful triggers

02:18.172 --> 02:20.572
like, uh, oh, let's say...

02:20.574 --> 02:22.407
Helping with the laundry?
Exactly.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
Having to pay my doctor's bill?

02:24.411 --> 02:25.777
Don't play with me, man.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.613
I will mess you up.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.016
Here's a signed certification
of your condition.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.985
This is a bona fide
medical excuse

02:32.987 --> 02:35.254
from doing anything
you find taxing.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.788
But you only use that

02:36.790 --> 02:39.424
when absolutely necessary,
right, Homie?

02:39.426 --> 02:41.026
Marge, please!

02:41.028 --> 02:42.995
I'll probably <i>never</i> use it.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.997
Dad, can you drive me
to Milhouse's?

02:44.999 --> 02:46.098

02:46.100 --> 02:47.766
There's a spider
in my room!

02:47.768 --> 02:49.101
Narcolepsy.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.336
Dr. Hibbert called in a
prescription for you to pick up.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.337
Narcolepsy.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.373
Yes, <i>for</i> narcolepsy,

02:54.375 --> 02:55.974
which you should get now.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.177
You can't spend
half your life napping.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.445
Maggie does, and you
think she's adorable.

03:00.447 --> 03:03.549
Yes, because babies
are always cute.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.617
(snoring)

03:06.786 --> 03:08.187
(coughing)

03:08.189 --> 03:11.390
(sniffs) Oh, that baby
needs a diaper change.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.392
Nar-co-lep-sy.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.560
(groans)

03:14.562 --> 03:16.695
Homie, you have no idea
what it's like

03:16.697 --> 03:18.463
being married to you.

03:18.465 --> 03:22.067
Me being married to me, eh?

03:23.236 --> 03:25.204
("Bridal Chorus" playing)

03:25.206 --> 03:27.406
HOMER:
Stop the wedding!

03:27.408 --> 03:28.907
What about our child?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.242
(baby whimpers)

03:30.244 --> 03:31.243
(dog barks)

03:31.245 --> 03:32.811
Don't forget me.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.447
Now I've seen everything.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.384
A window that talks?!

03:41.254 --> 03:44.223
Okay, can you explain again
how I take this medication?

03:44.225 --> 03:45.524
One a day with food.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.260
Yeah, but what kind
of food, girly?

03:48.262 --> 03:50.529
Stuffed cabbage,
a nice bowl of soup?

03:50.531 --> 03:53.865
(sighs) Any idea
when you'll get to me?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.534
Well, there's four
old people ahead of you,

03:55.536 --> 03:57.502
so how's Thursday at 1:00?

03:57.504 --> 03:59.738
Oh, you know it's funny
that you should say one,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.407
'cause that's how many
grandchildren that I have.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.042
I'm gonna have grandchildren

04:04.044 --> 04:06.078
by the time I get
through this line.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.346
Oh, that's so nice.
Isn't that interesting?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.447
Oh, well,
congratulations.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.715
(giggles)

04:09.717 --> 04:11.950
Narcolepsy, take me away!

04:11.952 --> 04:13.352
Oh! (grunts)

04:14.287 --> 04:15.754
(groans)
(toy squeaks)

04:19.525 --> 04:20.859
(sniffing)

04:20.861 --> 04:22.461
I smell beer.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.629
Did you go to Moe's?

04:23.631 --> 04:26.064
Every time I have beer
on my breath,

04:26.066 --> 04:27.633
you assume I've been drinking.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.901
(groans loudly)

04:29.903 --> 04:31.470
Oh, that's a long one.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.305
Did you at least get
the medicine?

04:33.307 --> 04:35.941
I tried, and I failed.
Miserably.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.543
But I'm willing to work
this out in counseling.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.312
(groans) We've been
to every counselor

04:40.314 --> 04:42.748
from Avery to Zabinsky.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.316
But not Zilowitz.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.319
HOMER: <i>And that's why</i>
<i>there'll never be</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:50.222

as Chi-Chi Rodríguez.

04:50.224 --> 04:53.325
The name and the game,
he had it all.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.295
Okay, I think we got
a little off-track here.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.996
I know this marriage
isn't perfect,

04:57.998 --> 05:01.500
or even great,
but now I treasure the moments

05:01.502 --> 05:02.901
where it's just so-so.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.470
(snoring)
I'd kill for "okay."

05:05.472 --> 05:08.507
Please, please,
just tell me what to do.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.908
I've never said this--

05:09.910 --> 05:11.743
and I don't even know
if I'm supposed to say this--

05:11.745 --> 05:14.946
but this marriage is rotting
with the stench of death.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.949
Oh, that seems a little strong.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.585
How about reeking like
a trashcan in a dog park?

05:20.587 --> 05:23.488
Does my marriage have to be
something you can smell?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.757
(snoring)

05:25.759 --> 05:27.759
You see, Marge? You see?

05:27.761 --> 05:30.362
The only way you and Homer
will ever be happy

05:30.364 --> 05:32.331
is to spend a little time apart,

05:32.333 --> 05:34.166
followed by more time apart,

05:34.168 --> 05:35.701
followed by a divorce.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.469
What?!

05:37.471 --> 05:38.937
What is... What,
what's going on?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.439
Wait, no, no, no,
I remember.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.441
Happy anniversary.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.975
Homer, Homer, listen to me.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.944
There's just so much
I can take.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.546
No, we can save this.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.147
We'll go to a therapist.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.382
We're <i>at</i> a therapist!

05:50.384 --> 05:52.451
How you doin'?

05:52.453 --> 05:55.354
What's going on here?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.456
(sobbing)

05:57.458 --> 05:58.557
Nothing.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.825
Everything's fine.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.560
See? (sobbing continues)

06:01.562 --> 06:04.162
I'll love you forever.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.031
Kids, a professional felt

06:06.033 --> 06:07.733
the best way
for your father and me

06:07.735 --> 06:09.401
to work on our relationship

06:09.403 --> 06:11.069
was to give up on it.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.572
But after a while,
Dad's coming back?

06:13.574 --> 06:14.639
Oh, yeah, of course.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.074
Maybe not.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.642
Oh, Marge,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.811
after all my divorce-worthy
statements and actions,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.580
many of which
you don't know about,

06:21.582 --> 06:24.483
how can you kick me out
now that I'm sick?

06:24.485 --> 06:26.818
Narcolepsy is a serious thing.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.455
Maybe because you didn't take it
seriously enough.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.427
I pity you!

Just kidding.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.000
If Marge is in play,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.435
I'm cleaning up.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.604
♪ Got a date with an angel

09:32.606 --> 09:35.507
♪ Got to meet her at 7:00.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.775
(belches)

09:36.777 --> 09:38.610
Hey, guys, knock it off, huh?

09:38.612 --> 09:41.846
I'm sure Homer and Midge just
need to talk things out there.

09:41.848 --> 09:42.781
(phone rings)

09:42.783 --> 09:44.683
And there she is now.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.451
Hello, baby.

09:46.453 --> 09:49.621
Y... Oh, it's the pharmacy.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.291
They want me to pick up
my prescription. (sighs)

09:53.293 --> 09:54.859
Well, that man just won

09:54.861 --> 09:57.262
the Saddest Man
in the Bar competition.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.764
I was so damn close!

10:03.302 --> 10:05.704
Whoa, nice fill.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.641
You've got amphetamines,
anticataplectics and GHB,

10:09.643 --> 10:12.711
also known as Georgia Homeboy
or Liquid Ecstasy.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.646
Do not take these with alcohol.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.815
What if I've already
been drinking,

10:16.817 --> 10:18.083
and I don't plan to stop?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.451
Are you asking me out?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.785
I mean, you're not,

10:20.787 --> 10:22.654
but it seems like
you'd be fun to hang with,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.456
and I'm pretty fascinating
myself; I'm an author.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.224
I thought you worked
in a drugstore?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.259
Tennessee Williams worked
in a shoe factory.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.462
Boy, you're pretty
fast with that fact.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.796
You want to go out or not?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.898
Well, I don't know
what you see in me.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.067
I'm just a lonely guy
with a bag full of drugs.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.837
Huh! Come with <i>moi.</i>

10:38.839 --> 10:40.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:40.841 --> 10:42.807
You're moving way
too fast for me.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.476
I get that a lot.
(sighs)

10:44.478 --> 10:45.844
No, what I'm saying is

10:45.846 --> 10:49.080
you're walking faster
than I can walk.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.915
How fast can you go?

10:50.917 --> 10:54.753
Pretend you're walking
a very slow old dog.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.722
(both growling, barking)

10:59.925 --> 11:01.993
(rock music playing)

11:05.665 --> 11:07.165
No autographs.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.967
I just need you
to sign your bill.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.669
The monkey
made the reservation.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.737
He pays.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.675
I think it's cool
how you owned your own baldness

11:16.677 --> 11:18.109
by shaving your head.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.779
Well, I saw a picture of
Jeffrey Katzenberg once,

11:20.781 --> 11:22.681
and said,
"Yes, that's for me."

11:22.683 --> 11:24.849
Okay, listen,
I'm just floating this,

11:24.851 --> 11:26.551
but have you ever thought

11:26.553 --> 11:28.687
that it might be a good thing
Marge dumped you?

11:28.689 --> 11:29.888
What are you saying?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.856
You guys were so young
when you met.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.692
She was your first girlfriend.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.560
I've dated
more girls than you,

11:35.562 --> 11:37.729
but now you're free
to try something new.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.364
Uh...

11:39.366 --> 11:40.865
it's... getting late.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.900
I should go.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.802
The donut shop
will be...

11:43.804 --> 11:46.838
throwing out their...

11:46.840 --> 11:49.074
unsold donuts.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.644
You can buy them... cheap.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.946
Don't you want
to finish your drink?

11:56.749 --> 11:59.384
Eh, you're the pharmacist.

Why would you do
that to your body?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.278
I thought you had one, too.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.446
Those are stretch
marks, young lady.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.448
I've had three children.

every Christmas I ask
for size 36 pants,

and I still buy Beanie Babies.

(phone beeps, line rings)

13:52.632 --> 13:54.032
Hello, Homer.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.934
Marge is getting ready
for a date.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.969
Marge? On a date?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.838
Yep, but I'll make you a deal.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.873
I will try to save your marriage

14:01.875 --> 14:04.008
if you can guess which one I am.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.643
Patty?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.851
I'm gonna get one, two, three,
four, five scones.

14:12.853 --> 14:13.885
You guys want anything?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.019
We're fine.
No, thanks.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.020
We're all right.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.223
Candice, what is his deal?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.491
(gasps)
Is he paying your rent?
No.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.861
Is he giving a kidney
to your mother?
No.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.063
Is he good at sitting on
suitcases that are too full?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.898
Yes, but no.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.167
Is he your guest
at a dinner for schmucks?
No.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.870
(gasps) Are you a
Humpty Dumpty catcher?

14:31.872 --> 14:33.071
Be honest.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.672
All no.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.141
Does her remind you
of a childhood snowman?

14:37.143 --> 14:39.177
Yes, that's it!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.980
And the great thing is
he will never melt.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.083
Man, I would love to get back
into snowman shape.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.418
I can't even fit
in my scarf anymore.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.555
Whoa, this is serious.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.357
Complimentary tattoos.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.326
Yeah, I've always been looking
for the very special lady

14:55.328 --> 14:56.928
who would match up with this.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.564
(whinnying)

14:59.566 --> 15:00.698
All right, very funny.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.000
You two celebrating or what?

15:02.002 --> 15:03.735
Two Scorpinos, Moe.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.103
Scorpinos, you got it.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.171
And those are served in, uh...

15:07.173 --> 15:08.373
Champagne flute.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.908
Champagne flute, got it.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.709
And that is a...

15:11.711 --> 15:14.712
Glass! A clean glass.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.015
Ah, coming right up there,
Your Highness.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.016
Nut case.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.084
(engine revs, tires squeal)

15:24.556 --> 15:26.858
Wow, Homer,
you really stuck the landing

15:26.860 --> 15:28.359
after your separation.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.561
Yeah, it's great.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.797
Except her friends
are always over.

15:32.799 --> 15:37.201
I've been there for three weeks,
and I can't find the TV.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.603
And no one has any problems,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.571
except they talk
about them endlessly.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.140
Kind of like
you're doing now?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.375
And the weirdest
thing of all is

15:44.377 --> 15:46.411
now she wants me
to meet her dad.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.313
Wow, who pays for that dinner?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.114
I plan to pretend
there's a bug in my food

15:50.116 --> 15:51.549
and get the meal for free.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.817
Smooth.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.320
H-Hello, sir.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.388
Thank you for inviting me
to dinner, sir.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.990
Homer, relax.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.558
I have no problem
with the age difference

16:00.560 --> 16:02.327
between you and my daughter.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.996
In fact, I've been dating a
much younger woman myself.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.798
Oh, here she comes now.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.167
(humming happily)

16:09.169 --> 16:10.635
(gasping)

16:11.804 --> 16:14.172
Okay, okay,
we can be adults about this.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.240
Waiter, champagne?

16:18.610 --> 16:21.012
(sputtering)

16:26.852 --> 16:28.353
So I can't date
an older man,

16:28.355 --> 16:30.188
but your girlfriend can?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.190
She's not my girlfriend.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.425
Candice and I don't use labels.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.595
Mm, doesn't look like she uses
that much shampoo, either.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.997
Lay off my girlfriend!

16:38.999 --> 16:41.099
Roger is great
with the kids.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.001
He even taught
Bart how to bunt.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.936
Oh, so now you're super dad?

16:44.938 --> 16:46.804
When I was a kid,
you were never around.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.272
You missed
my high school play.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
You told me not to come.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.210
You're supposed
to fight me on that!

16:52.212 --> 16:53.211
Well, Marge,

16:53.213 --> 16:56.014
your Roger's
not so perfect now.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.450
He's got a screwed up daughter
with a pathetic boyfriend.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.386
Candice, dear, I apologize.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.122
I'm trying so hard
to set my life right.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.024
Oh, speaking of which.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.192
Marge, I am going to do
something I should've done

17:08.194 --> 17:10.061
three weeks ago
when I met you.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.396
Will you marry me, Marge?

17:11.398 --> 17:12.497
Yes.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.632
As soon as my divorce is final.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.235
Then you can put a ring
on my finger, Homer.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.636
I'm already pregnant.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.871
You're pregnant?!

17:19.873 --> 17:21.639
But I kept my shirt on!

17:21.641 --> 17:23.474
(echoing):
No!

17:24.543 --> 17:25.877
(snoring)

17:25.879 --> 17:27.745
Huh?
What am I doing here?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.148
Sleeping through
our therapy session.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.351
Dreaming only about you.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.919
So none of it happened?

17:34.921 --> 17:36.154
We're still together?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.189
Somehow.
Whoo-hoo!

17:38.191 --> 17:41.159
And you thought our only
option was to break up.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.894
I never said that.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.729
If I told people
that didn't belong together

17:44.731 --> 17:47.698
they shouldn't be together,
I'd be out of a job.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.734
Huh, I must have
dreamed that, too.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.737
Okay, why don't you tell us more
about this dream?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.572
All you need to know
about my dream

17:54.574 --> 17:58.109
is that Marge and I have been
completely turned around by it,

17:58.111 --> 17:59.911
and like Scrooge,
I will demonstrate

17:59.913 --> 18:01.579
I have learned my lesson

18:01.581 --> 18:03.281
by making a boy run to the store

18:03.283 --> 18:05.349
and buy me a goose.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.086
I think you're going to have
to do a little more, Homer.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.455
Oh, I'll do a lot more
than a little more!

18:10.457 --> 18:12.557
I'll do some.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.525
If you could just be good
for a month,

18:14.527 --> 18:16.561
that would really
show me something.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.129
Absolutely.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.231
Can the month be February?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.199
Okay, March.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.736
You did it, Homie!

It means,
like all married women,

sometimes you're sick
of your husband,

so I can tie it in a bow.
