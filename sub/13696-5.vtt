WEBVTT

00:36.122 --> 00:37.165
(ANIMALS CHIRPING)

00:47.508 --> 00:48.801
Dr McRae?

00:49.969 --> 00:51.512
That's right.

00:51.596 --> 00:53.765
I got here early.
Thought I'd take a look.

00:53.848 --> 00:55.767
I'm really grateful
you could come.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.769
You caught me
at Glasgow airport.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.395
I was off to Peru,

00:59.479 --> 01:01.397
but I'm a sucker
for a sick tree.

01:01.981 --> 01:03.191
And is it?

01:03.274 --> 01:04.858
Only tests will tell.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.402
You see,
there's a million fungi

01:06.486 --> 01:08.821
whose only ambition is to
settle down somewhere nice,

01:08.905 --> 01:11.741
and get pan-fried in butter
with a bit of Ayrshire bacon.

01:12.825 --> 01:14.077
Then there's the bad guys.

01:14.994 --> 01:16.746
Well, how bad can it be?

01:16.829 --> 01:19.165
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, Mr MacDonald,

01:19.248 --> 01:22.293
I've plenty of tests to do.

01:22.377 --> 01:25.296
I'll get these labelled up,
and then I need to find
a bed for the night.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.716
It's Paul, and you
must stay with us.

01:29.384 --> 01:30.510
Huh, thanks.

02:09.674 --> 02:11.050
(SCREAMING)

02:19.767 --> 02:20.768
Amy?

02:23.312 --> 02:24.522
Bad dream, dear?

02:24.605 --> 02:26.566
It was the week
before the college interview,

02:26.649 --> 02:28.151
and I hadn't done
any work for it,

02:28.234 --> 02:30.360
and I had to do a still life,
a landscape, and an abstract,

02:30.445 --> 02:31.738
and I didn't know
where to start.

02:31.821 --> 02:33.573
There, there.
It's just a bad dream.

02:33.656 --> 02:36.868
No! It is a week
to the interview,
and I haven't done anything,

02:36.951 --> 02:40.580
and I have to do a still life,
and a landscape,
and an abstract,

02:40.663 --> 02:42.582
and I don't know
where to start.

02:45.418 --> 02:47.170
Forgive me, but how
is it worth it flying you

02:47.253 --> 02:49.922
all the way around the world
just to look at a tree?

02:50.006 --> 02:52.342
Most of my work's
in developing countries.

02:52.425 --> 02:54.677
One sick tree can wipe out
all their woods.

02:54.761 --> 02:58.222
Local economy collapses,
kids go hungry,
I've seen it happen.

02:59.682 --> 03:01.434
Makes our problem
seem a bit paltry.

03:01.517 --> 03:02.935
No, not at all.

03:03.019 --> 03:04.854
Your woodland's really
important around here.

03:04.937 --> 03:06.064
Always has been.

03:07.648 --> 03:09.317
You've looked us up,
haven't you?

03:09.400 --> 03:13.071
Yeah, I did a job nearby
two years ago.

03:13.154 --> 03:14.614
I was here a couple of months.

03:14.697 --> 03:16.741
A couple of months?

03:16.824 --> 03:19.118
It must have been something
dramatic to keep you off
an aeroplane that long.

03:19.202 --> 03:23.289
Yeah, it was.
Didn't work out though.
Goes with the territory.

03:28.086 --> 03:29.128
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:29.212 --> 03:30.463
Come in.

03:33.299 --> 03:35.385
I brought your book back.

03:40.222 --> 03:42.100
You didn't need to do that.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.268
Well, I did.

03:54.112 --> 03:55.363
You got everything unpacked?

03:55.446 --> 03:57.490
Nearly.

03:57.573 --> 03:59.659
I'm really grateful
for your help.

03:59.742 --> 04:01.994
And for lending
me the furniture.

04:02.078 --> 04:04.330
I burnt everything
you had to a crisp.

04:04.414 --> 04:05.498
It's the least I could do.

04:05.581 --> 04:06.582
(LAUGHS)

04:13.006 --> 04:14.757
Paul, I need one or two
odds and ends,

04:14.841 --> 04:15.883
is there a shop
in the village?

04:15.967 --> 04:18.219
Oh, sorry, I didn't...

04:18.302 --> 04:20.137
PAUL: Oh Malcolm, hi. Um...

04:20.221 --> 04:22.974
Dr McRae,
this is Iona MacLean,

04:24.224 --> 04:25.517
one of my tenants.

04:26.144 --> 04:27.477
Iona.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.189
Dr McRae and I have met.

04:31.441 --> 04:32.775
Dr McRae, is it?

04:34.068 --> 04:36.195
Well, it's been a while.

04:36.279 --> 04:39.157
-Two years.
-Mmm.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.160
Uh, Dr McRae is just checking
out some of our trees

04:43.703 --> 04:45.371
enroute for Peru.

04:45.455 --> 04:47.081
Mmm. Still on the move, then?

04:47.749 --> 04:49.167
You look great.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.169
What kind of shop, Malcolm?

04:53.504 --> 04:54.797
I'm going to leave you to it.

04:57.050 --> 04:58.508
I'll see you.

04:59.719 --> 05:01.554
Well, it's a small place.

05:02.513 --> 05:04.390
-Bye, Paul.
-Bye, Iona.

05:14.317 --> 05:16.944
It was Iona that kept you
off planes that long.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.532
We had a few weeks of
something very close to bliss.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.788
Then a month in Ecuador,

05:26.871 --> 05:29.290
a couple of weeks in Congo,

05:29.374 --> 05:31.501
New Zealand, I think.

05:31.584 --> 05:32.585
Bit of a blur.

05:35.505 --> 05:37.674
-Do you mind?
-No.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.013
Sounds like quite a holiday.

05:44.889 --> 05:47.141
I was working.

05:47.225 --> 05:49.560
Business with pleasure.
Except Brazil.

05:50.853 --> 05:53.648
That was just the pleasure.

05:53.731 --> 05:57.402
There's this hotel, you see,
way up in the canopy
of the rainforest.

05:57.485 --> 05:59.028
I say hotel.

05:59.112 --> 06:01.906
I mean, it's more like
a collection
of tiny treehouses

06:01.989 --> 06:04.701
set amongst some
of the wildest nature
on the planet,

06:04.784 --> 06:07.620
but with every comfort
you can imagine.

06:08.496 --> 06:09.914
I mean the bed, Paul...

06:10.331 --> 06:12.375
Ah!

06:12.458 --> 06:16.921
It was like lying naked
on a cloud surrounded
by all the birds of paradise.

06:17.005 --> 06:18.381
Ah!

06:18.464 --> 06:20.633
Iona enjoy it, did she?

06:22.010 --> 06:24.429
We'd gone there
to get married.

06:24.512 --> 06:27.932
They do a ceremony there
which is recognised here.
Up in the trees.

06:30.643 --> 06:33.438
It's a vast green cathedral,

06:33.521 --> 06:36.482
sunlight shafting through...
Ah!

06:37.608 --> 06:38.651
What went wrong?

06:40.153 --> 06:41.154
Me.

06:42.655 --> 06:45.616
Me. Cold feet.

06:47.201 --> 06:50.329
Absolutely at the
last possible minute.

06:52.331 --> 06:54.125
Completely inexcusable.

06:56.794 --> 06:58.420
I'm a bit of a shark
you see, Paul.

06:58.504 --> 07:01.090
Not the killing bit, you know.

07:01.174 --> 07:03.551
But when a shark
stops moving it dies.

07:06.762 --> 07:09.890
Must have been terrible
for both of you.

07:10.683 --> 07:11.975
(DISHES CLATTERING)

07:12.060 --> 07:13.394
EWAN: This do you?

07:14.645 --> 07:16.272
Have you never
seen a still life?

07:17.023 --> 07:18.358
EWAN: Dish, you said.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.692
That's a dish.

07:19.776 --> 07:20.777
Amy?

07:21.652 --> 07:23.112
I'm Danny.

07:23.196 --> 07:24.697
I'm all yours for the week.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.077
EWAN: Who's this guy?

07:31.245 --> 07:33.122
Er, can I help you, mate?

07:38.252 --> 07:40.380
Hang on. Who the hell are you?

07:40.463 --> 07:41.506
MOLLY: Ah, good!

07:41.589 --> 07:43.216
You've found each other.

07:43.299 --> 07:46.177
MOLLY: Danny's agreed
to spend a few days,
one-to-one with you,

07:46.260 --> 07:48.554
to help you prepare
for your college interview.

07:48.638 --> 07:49.806
Are you a painter?

07:49.889 --> 07:51.808
The best the glen
has ever produced.

07:51.891 --> 07:53.476
Well, it's a very small glen.

07:55.103 --> 07:56.562
That's a dish.

07:56.646 --> 08:00.358
A leading West End gallery
is interested in Danny's work.

08:00.441 --> 08:03.361
Mrs MacD's got the
wood on the owner.

08:03.444 --> 08:06.489
Well, he may be a crook
but he's a good judge
of modern art.

08:06.572 --> 08:08.825
Ah, you're very good
to me, Mrs MacD.

08:09.617 --> 08:11.869
Now, Amy...

08:12.912 --> 08:14.163
Let's go draw.

08:26.426 --> 08:28.928
GOLLY: So, do you
remember what I did?

08:29.012 --> 08:31.472
I tied the thread onto
the eye section,

08:31.556 --> 08:33.933
a whip finish, and cast off.

08:35.893 --> 08:37.979
And then your father's
own wee secret.

08:39.938 --> 08:41.607
Just a blob...

08:42.692 --> 08:44.360
...of nail varnish.

08:46.112 --> 08:47.280
There.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.159
You remember all that, my lad

08:52.535 --> 08:54.953
and you'll land yourself
many a fine trout.

08:55.705 --> 08:57.749
Ha!

08:57.831 --> 09:00.084
The fence up at
Dunnoch's sorted.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.420
Thanks, lass.

09:02.502 --> 09:05.006
The bracing on the bridge
is all rotten.

09:05.089 --> 09:08.343
I'm gonna have to fit new
and cut some fresh poles
for the handrails.

09:08.426 --> 09:09.469
Okay.

09:11.512 --> 09:14.390
So, loads of grouse chicks
coming back.

09:14.474 --> 09:17.643
The burning off
worked brilliantly. It's gonna
be a fantastic season.

09:17.727 --> 09:18.770
Yeah?

09:19.228 --> 09:20.271
Yeah.

09:21.064 --> 09:22.565
Pheasant too.

09:22.648 --> 09:26.235
That new winter feed mix
has upped the numbers
amazingly.

09:26.319 --> 09:27.820
Hmm, would you hear that,
Cameron?

09:28.780 --> 09:30.531
Hmm? Do you hear that?

09:30.615 --> 09:34.327
It's all in good hands until
you're ready to take over.

09:35.203 --> 09:36.371
GOLLY: Yes, it is.

09:36.996 --> 09:38.456
Yes, it is.

09:39.999 --> 09:42.543
One day you'll be doing this.

09:42.627 --> 09:44.295
You'll be doing it
a lot better than me.

09:45.797 --> 09:47.215
Hmm?

09:47.298 --> 09:51.386
Try and concentrate on
the spaces around things.

09:51.469 --> 09:54.430
You know, they're just
as important as
the objects themselves.

09:55.348 --> 09:57.266
AMY: Yours is so full of life.

09:57.350 --> 09:58.893
Mine's all flat and boring.

09:58.976 --> 10:00.395
(CHUCKLING)

10:00.478 --> 10:02.939
DANNY:
It's not just looking, Amy.
It's seeing.

10:03.022 --> 10:04.941
Tea up, Rembrandt. (EXHALES)

10:06.776 --> 10:09.153
We'd soon as not bother
right now.

10:09.237 --> 10:11.531
Ah, no trouble,
the kettle was on.

10:13.324 --> 10:14.992
(PANTING)

10:19.539 --> 10:21.791
There's my tatty dishcloth!

10:21.874 --> 10:24.627
Ha! I'd no idea
it was artistic.

10:24.711 --> 10:25.837
You live and learn, eh?

10:27.088 --> 10:28.256
So, milk?

10:28.339 --> 10:29.590
I take it with lemon, thanks.

10:29.674 --> 10:31.426
No bother.

10:31.509 --> 10:32.969
BOTH: Ewan!

10:33.052 --> 10:34.804
What do you take me for?

10:38.099 --> 10:40.226
Oh no, that's Molly's stuff!

10:41.811 --> 10:43.688
BOTH: No!

10:51.070 --> 10:52.238
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

10:52.989 --> 10:53.990
More tea?

11:06.544 --> 11:09.756
Of all the
tree health specialists
in all the world...

11:10.840 --> 11:13.509
Yeah, it was quite a surprise.

11:13.593 --> 11:16.846
The bloke who walks out
on your wedding day in the
Brazilian jungle turns up,

11:16.929 --> 11:18.723
and it's quite a surprise?

11:18.806 --> 11:19.974
What would it take
to shock you?

11:20.058 --> 11:22.310
Well, I see you two
made progress.

11:22.393 --> 11:24.103
Whereas you never thought
to mention it.

11:25.438 --> 11:27.607
Paul, please don't
take that tone with me.

11:27.690 --> 11:30.777
-What tone?
-Your military voice.
I don't like it.

11:30.860 --> 11:34.864
Sorry, I don't want to
make a big deal out of it,
I'm just interested.

11:34.947 --> 11:36.908
Well, it was...

11:36.991 --> 11:39.577
...just something between us,
and it was quite a while ago.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.497
So, can we just drop it?

11:42.580 --> 11:44.082
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

11:44.165 --> 11:47.293
Look, it's none
of my business.

11:47.377 --> 11:50.129
Malcolm is part of my life
that I've moved on from.

11:50.922 --> 11:52.674
Understood.

11:52.757 --> 11:55.593
So, there's nothing to stop us
having dinner together then?

11:57.011 --> 11:58.221
What, the three of us?

11:58.304 --> 11:59.347
Yeah, why not?

12:01.683 --> 12:02.725
No reason.

12:03.935 --> 12:05.103
Great.

12:06.354 --> 12:07.522
I'll see you later.

12:09.565 --> 12:10.566
(SIGHS)

12:13.236 --> 12:15.446
The Army? That's a fairly
nomadic lifestyle, isn't it?

12:16.572 --> 12:17.907
I got around, yeah.

12:17.990 --> 12:19.450
How much of a wrench was it
giving all that up?

12:20.410 --> 12:21.828
Not much.

12:21.911 --> 12:24.455
We didn't do so much
lying about naked on clouds.

12:24.539 --> 12:27.625
More like getting soaking wet
under a bivouac in Bosnia.

12:27.709 --> 12:30.044
-So you don't miss it?
-No, not at all.

12:31.254 --> 12:32.755
But we're all different,
aren't we?

12:32.839 --> 12:37.510
As you say, some of us
have to keep moving
to stay alive.

12:37.593 --> 12:41.055
It's just a bit sad, though,
travelling the world
caring for trees.

12:42.807 --> 12:45.351
They can't put their arms
around you and care back.

12:46.978 --> 12:48.604
No, I guess not.

12:48.688 --> 12:50.356
But here I am with
a second chance.

12:52.025 --> 12:53.234
At what?

12:53.317 --> 12:55.153
When you phoned
in the airport,

12:55.236 --> 12:58.114
and I realised who you were,
where you were.

12:58.197 --> 13:01.826
I don't believe in signs,
Paul, but if you'd made
that call one minute later,

13:01.909 --> 13:05.246
I'd have been through
those barriers and gone.

13:05.329 --> 13:07.832
I think this'll turn out
to have been a
life-changing moment.

13:11.627 --> 13:13.671
-To you.
-Don't mention it.

13:15.798 --> 13:17.216
And here she is.

13:26.225 --> 13:27.310
Good evening.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.355
I hope you like this.

13:32.023 --> 13:33.066
Pecharmant.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.694
Personally, I think
Bordeaux's unbeatable.

13:36.778 --> 13:39.739
So do I. Course,
this is a Bergerac.

13:39.822 --> 13:41.532
What's a few miles
between friends, eh?

13:42.450 --> 13:43.451
I like Bergerac.

13:44.702 --> 13:47.246
Mmm. This one's delicious.

13:48.539 --> 13:50.750
It goes with the territory,
I suppose.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.502
Oh, life wasn't
always like this.

13:52.585 --> 13:55.380
No, I wasn't born
with a silver spoon.
Far from it.

13:55.463 --> 13:58.174
Well, my father was
out of work throughout
most of my childhood.

13:58.257 --> 14:02.762
I never knew mine. I had to be
the man of the house
from about five years old.

14:02.845 --> 14:04.055
MALCOLM: When I say father...

14:05.682 --> 14:07.266
But these things
make you stronger, eh?

14:07.350 --> 14:08.393
PAUL: They do.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.521
-When I was in Bosnia...
-MALCOLM: When I
was in Borneo...

14:11.604 --> 14:13.314
Oh, go on.

14:13.398 --> 14:14.899
No, no, please.

14:14.982 --> 14:16.943
What does a girl have to do
to get a drink around here?

14:17.026 --> 14:19.404
I'm sorry, Iona.
You should have said.

14:19.487 --> 14:21.364
My fault.
Monopolising our host.

14:21.447 --> 14:23.700
No, no. My fault entirely.

14:37.005 --> 14:38.131
Mmm.

14:38.214 --> 14:40.258
Sirloin is delicious, Paul.

14:40.341 --> 14:41.759
As a matter of fact,
it's rib eye.

14:55.064 --> 14:57.859
(WHISPERING)
Iona, I think we should just
sit down and talk about this.

14:57.942 --> 14:59.736
I don't want to sit down
and talk about it.

14:59.819 --> 15:02.280
I'm glad to see
you haven't lost your flair
for perfect timing.

15:02.363 --> 15:03.573
MALCOLM: Iona, wait!

15:03.656 --> 15:05.783
Have you any idea
how much you hurt me?

15:05.867 --> 15:07.160
I'm a different guy now.

15:07.243 --> 15:10.288
Well, I'm different too.
I've moved on.

15:10.371 --> 15:13.416
Aye, and I can guess who with.

15:19.547 --> 15:21.049
Oh, not staying on for one?

15:21.132 --> 15:23.092
No, thanks.
I've a heavy day tomorrow.

15:27.305 --> 15:28.389
Iona?

15:28.473 --> 15:30.266
-(DOOR SLAMS)
-Iona?

15:40.568 --> 15:43.154
(ENGINE WHIRRING)

15:49.452 --> 15:50.870
(CUTS ENGINE)

16:02.965 --> 16:05.009
Careful, Jess,
you'll hurt yourself.

16:06.844 --> 16:08.971
What brings you
up here, Robbie?

16:09.055 --> 16:12.475
(SIGHS) Just left your dad.
I'm drumming up entries
for the Ghillies' Challenge.

16:12.558 --> 16:14.143
And he sent you up here?

16:14.227 --> 16:15.728
Told me where I'd find you.

16:15.812 --> 16:17.313
So Dad's not
entering this year?

16:17.397 --> 16:20.274
Time for the
younger generation to
come to the fore, eh?

16:20.358 --> 16:24.821
It's a great contest, Jess.
The battle for
the Cuach na Cuiraidh.

16:24.904 --> 16:26.572
It's not just the winning.

16:26.656 --> 16:29.409
It's the respect of
your fellow Ghillies.

16:29.492 --> 16:31.536
The chance to be a leader
in your calling.

16:31.619 --> 16:33.204
Yeah, it's a great
opportunity.

16:33.287 --> 16:35.498
Aye, it's a mighty challenge.

16:35.581 --> 16:37.333
I'm really pleased you
want me to be involved.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.669
(LAUGHS) It's a great honour
for you, Jess.

16:39.752 --> 16:40.878
It would make me really happy.

16:40.962 --> 16:42.338
Make you happy?

16:42.422 --> 16:45.008
-Why wouldn't it?
-Because I might win.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.134
Win?

16:46.217 --> 16:47.468
The Ghillies' Challenge.

16:47.552 --> 16:50.930
You? Enter the challenge?

16:51.014 --> 16:54.058
Aye, good one, Jess, good one.

16:54.142 --> 16:56.811
No, no. I just need a date
for the winner's party.

16:57.812 --> 16:58.896
A what?

17:00.356 --> 17:03.276
So this, however you
pronounce it,

17:03.359 --> 17:05.611
could have infected
more trees by now?

17:05.694 --> 17:08.031
Not could. Will.
You need to deal with it.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.781
Well, can't we wait
to see if it's spread?

17:09.866 --> 17:11.200
By the time trees
show symptoms,

17:11.284 --> 17:12.702
they're already
infecting others.

17:12.785 --> 17:13.828
So what do I have to do?

17:16.664 --> 17:18.958
Look, this particular strain
is windborne, right?

17:19.041 --> 17:22.962
Now, according to this,
you've had fairly consistent
south easterlies this month.

17:23.046 --> 17:24.130
Meaning?

17:24.213 --> 17:25.798
Meaning hopefully,

17:25.882 --> 17:28.009
only the trees in the
north-west quadrant
will have to come down.

17:28.092 --> 17:29.886
-How many?
-To the edge of the wood.

17:29.969 --> 17:31.387
(LAUGHS)

17:31.471 --> 17:33.348
You can't be serious.

17:33.431 --> 17:36.309
We're talking about acres of
woodland that'll take
years to replace.

17:36.392 --> 17:38.936
Then with any luck,
the rest of your forestry
will test clear.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.313
Well, there must be
something you can do.

17:40.396 --> 17:41.439
Sorry.

17:43.566 --> 17:44.692
I want a second opinion.

17:44.776 --> 17:45.943
You can do what you like.

17:46.027 --> 17:47.904
But delay and you'll
lose more woodland.

17:50.990 --> 17:54.035
Look, I can recommend
a contractor who'll do it
at a reasonable price,

17:54.118 --> 17:56.120
but it still won't be cheap.

17:56.204 --> 17:58.121
What about the timber?
Is it saleable?

17:58.206 --> 17:59.706
Get it done now, yeah.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.876
Any delay, no.
No one will touch it.

18:06.506 --> 18:09.300
MOLLY: Jess,
how are you feeling?

18:09.384 --> 18:11.552
Robbie Rintoul stopped
by today.

18:11.636 --> 18:13.763
Have you heard of
the Cuach na Cuiraidh?

18:13.846 --> 18:16.307
The Cup of the Strong Man.

18:16.391 --> 18:18.267
Your father won
three times in a row.

18:18.351 --> 18:19.977
Still holds the record,
I believe.

18:20.061 --> 18:22.438
Aye, that's the one.
The Cup of the Strong Man.

18:22.522 --> 18:24.315
Guess what he wanted?

18:24.399 --> 18:25.483
Who, dear?

18:25.566 --> 18:27.068
The Rintoul creature.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.946
Me, the Glenbogle Ghillie
to take part in the challenge?

18:30.029 --> 18:32.031
(IMITATING ROBBIE)
No, don't be silly, Jess.

18:32.115 --> 18:34.367
He wanted a date for
the party afterwards.

18:34.450 --> 18:36.119
Oh, what are you
going to wear?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.164
-Molly.
-Sorry, just slipped out.

18:40.248 --> 18:43.543
I can't believe the man.
He knows I'm competent!

18:43.626 --> 18:45.628
No, I'm better than that.

18:45.712 --> 18:47.714
I'm as good as any Ghillie
on any estate around here
and he knows it.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.590
He's spoken to your
father, I suppose.

18:49.674 --> 18:51.968
-He's busy, obviously.
-Obviously.

18:52.051 --> 18:54.929
Jess, if you want to do it,
don't wait to be asked.

18:55.013 --> 18:56.681
I'm sure your father
will support you.

18:56.764 --> 18:59.684
No. I'm not asking Dad.
Excuse me.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.728
Then I'll help.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.605
No, thanks anyway.
I've got far too much to do.

19:22.331 --> 19:25.460
Another day,
another masterpiece, eh?

19:25.543 --> 19:28.296
I don't know how you do it.
I can barely handle
a toothbrush.

19:28.379 --> 19:30.214
Danny says
it's a state of mind.

19:30.298 --> 19:33.885
Daring to be different.
Embracing new ideas.

19:33.968 --> 19:36.346
Embracing, eh?
Aye, that figures.

19:36.429 --> 19:38.765
Hey, come on,
I've got a surprise.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.892
I've got to finish this
before Danny comes.

19:40.975 --> 19:42.810
Listen, listen,
art is like cooking.

19:42.894 --> 19:44.687
The trick is to know
when it's done.

19:45.730 --> 19:46.731
Come on.

19:53.446 --> 19:55.573
What is it they say about
all work and no play?

19:58.076 --> 19:59.619
(LAUGHING)

19:59.702 --> 20:01.120
Come here.

20:01.204 --> 20:03.081

20:25.269 --> 20:26.270

20:27.438 --> 20:29.774
-Comfortable?
-EWAN: Very, thanks.

20:29.857 --> 20:31.109
Did you find it?

20:31.192 --> 20:32.235
Is it finished?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.653
It's... Well...

20:34.320 --> 20:35.405
Isn't it?

20:35.947 --> 20:37.156
What?

20:37.240 --> 20:39.450
What do you want?

20:39.534 --> 20:43.246
To be comfortable
or to make good art?

20:43.329 --> 20:47.291
Because if you stay here
in your big house
with your comfortable life,

20:47.375 --> 20:50.336
then this is as good
as you'll ever get.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.005
Don't listen to him, Amy.
It's good.

20:52.088 --> 20:55.216
The artists in my studio
live and breathe their work.

20:55.299 --> 20:58.261
I mean, they can barely
scratch a living,

20:59.762 --> 21:01.556
but you should see
what they paint.

21:03.057 --> 21:06.102
So, Amy...

21:08.062 --> 21:09.397
What do you really want?

21:09.480 --> 21:10.690
To make good art.

21:19.490 --> 21:21.451
We suffer here too, you know!

21:25.496 --> 21:26.497
(SIGHS)

22:39.445 --> 22:41.197
Call it off.
We can't start felling yet.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.949
I've just booked the
contractors for tomorrow.

22:43.032 --> 22:44.158
No sawmill. Sold up.

22:44.242 --> 22:45.910
Shut down.
Kit to the scrappers.

22:45.993 --> 22:47.704
The only one?

22:47.787 --> 22:48.955
MALCOLM: You can't delay.

22:49.038 --> 22:50.206
Well, I've got nowhere
to process this stuff.

22:50.289 --> 22:52.000
And not a single tree
comes down until I have.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.835
Not good enough.

22:53.918 --> 22:55.837
Excuse me, this is my timber.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.630
No one tells me
when I can and can't fell it.

22:57.714 --> 22:58.923
You haven't time.

22:59.007 --> 23:01.009
I need this timber
sawn and sold

23:01.092 --> 23:02.593
or the contractors' bill
will finish us off.

23:02.677 --> 23:03.970
The Highlands is in
the middle of a massive

23:04.053 --> 23:05.346
replanting programme.

23:05.430 --> 23:07.682
Every day you delay
you put at risk years of work

23:07.765 --> 23:09.851
and tens of thousands
of young trees.

23:09.934 --> 23:11.352
Yeah, and if I go ahead,
I put at risk

and everyone in it.

two of you just...

Ha! I won't have anything left
to sue you with!

before Malcolm got here.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.282
Don't shoot the messenger.

23:24.365 --> 23:27.160
Oh sorry. Sorry,
I thought I was trying
to save my estate.

trying to be fair.

23:30.371 --> 23:31.748

give it a go.

for 40 years in case
the other one turned up.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.136
Or he lost a leg.

I don't know, Molly.

They're big strapping blokes,
these Ghillies,
and I've been in better shape.

24:33.309 --> 24:35.269
Then we've got
our work cut out.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.318
We're a man short, still.

24:43.444 --> 24:45.405
You all know we need six.

24:45.988 --> 24:47.573
Come on.

24:47.657 --> 24:50.493
Someone make up the numbers.

24:50.576 --> 24:55.540
As well as the Cuach na
Cuiraidh here, there's a cask
of our very own Lagganmore.

24:55.623 --> 25:00.336
Now you're talking.
Glenbogle will be represented,
and by its Ghillie.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.964
I've already spoke to him,
and he said no.

25:04.674 --> 25:06.050
I'm the Ghillie at Glenbogle.

25:06.134 --> 25:09.721
(LAUGHING) Nobody's
disputing that, Jess.

25:09.804 --> 25:11.681
So accept my entry.

25:11.764 --> 25:14.308
Look, Jess, I'll have a
word with the lads,

25:14.392 --> 25:19.272
and we'll look at instituting
a women's challenge
this time next year.

25:19.355 --> 25:21.649
-What do you say, lads?
-(MURMURING)

25:21.733 --> 25:23.359

as if we're out of date.

So, you know...

25:34.912 --> 25:36.039
The offer still stands.

25:37.540 --> 25:40.293
Oh, a date? Aye.

25:40.376 --> 25:42.420
I'm gonna have to
turn you down, Robbie.

25:42.503 --> 25:45.173

Didn't want you to
feel left out.

Oh, I won't feel left out,
Robbie, because I'm entering.

Oh, but listen...

MOLLY: No buts, Robbie.

25:55.391 --> 25:57.685
There's nothing against it
in the rules.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.646
(SIGHS)

26:02.106 --> 26:05.109
Okay, Jess...

26:05.193 --> 26:08.946
Your skean-dhu in the cask,
if you please.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.282
I don't have one on me,
funnily enough.

26:11.366 --> 26:15.078
ROBBIE: Oh, dear, well,
it's in the rules.

26:15.161 --> 26:17.663
No skean-dhu, no entry.

26:17.747 --> 26:20.333
I know I have one somewhere.

26:32.637 --> 26:34.013
And I want that back.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.795
Have you found a sawmill?

Yeah, from the wood
as far as the northern

28:16.699 --> 28:18.659
And?

28:18.743 --> 28:20.620
So far, it looks like the

within this wood.

28:20.703 --> 28:22.163

28:22.246 --> 28:23.664

have turned up.

I actually came to apologise
about the spat yesterday.

Well, I'm sure that Malcolm
won't hold it against you.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.751
That's very generous of him.

29:49.834 --> 29:53.921
It wasn't his fault, Paul.
He was only doing his job.
He didn't ruin your woods.

29:54.005 --> 29:56.966
Yeah, I know.
It won't happen again.

some time to myself.

for you, turning up like this.

-Do you?
-Yeah.

30:12.815 --> 30:15.943

you first meet him, but...

-Shocking.

Paul, don't. Stop it.

30:23.993 --> 30:27.288
Regardless of what
you think of him,
I loved the guy.

30:27.372 --> 30:30.291
We went through
a lot together.
He's part of my past.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.835

you know?

47:48.788 --> 47:50.581
(SIGHS) I don't know
what to say.

47:52.875 --> 47:59.841
Except... Where you got
that stubborn streak from...
I just do not know.

48:02.010 --> 48:03.261
(LAUGHS)

48:05.680 --> 48:07.390
I couldn't be more proud.

48:09.142 --> 48:10.643
But you're not finished yet.

48:12.061 --> 48:14.856
-Not by a long chalk!
-JESS: Really?

48:16.107 --> 48:17.567
(BANGING CASK)

48:19.569 --> 48:21.487
MAN: Go on, Jess!

48:21.571 --> 48:22.572
GOLLY: Here you go.

48:30.830 --> 48:32.582
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

48:33.624 --> 48:35.001
To us.

48:35.084 --> 48:36.544
Get it down you, Jess!

48:38.296 --> 48:39.630
(CHEERING)

48:43.301 --> 48:45.428
To the best job in the world!
(COUGHS)

48:46.012 --> 48:48.473
(CHEERING)

48:48.556 --> 48:53.353
Right, which one of you is man
enough to share the Cuach
with my daughter?

48:55.730 --> 48:57.315
I'll take a cup with you,
Jess.

49:00.735 --> 49:02.070
(CHEERING)

49:08.868 --> 49:10.203
(CHEERING)

49:12.538 --> 49:13.539
(SHOUTING)

49:41.234 --> 49:44.696
(SLURRING) The thing
about trees... They're
absolutely magnif...

49:44.779 --> 49:47.156
See if you get up one of
those trees and you
look out...

49:51.327 --> 49:55.707
The views of the forest...
Absolutely brilliant.
You should try it. Honestly.

49:55.790 --> 49:58.710
Give up. Become an
arboculturalist.

49:58.793 --> 50:01.129
-You found Danny's studio?
-Aye.

50:01.212 --> 50:03.798
It's not like him to
leave a job halfway through.

50:03.881 --> 50:06.718
Well, maybe that was my fault.
I acted the fool a bit.

50:06.801 --> 50:09.429
Perhaps it's time to stop
playing that part.

50:17.437 --> 50:19.355
-Hey.
-Hi.

50:19.439 --> 50:22.442
-How did it go?
-It was fantastic. Thanks.

50:22.525 --> 50:24.819
-You gave me the chance.
-Eventually.

50:24.902 --> 50:26.863
You gave me it.
That's what matters.

50:39.375 --> 50:44.005
(SLURRING) It's beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.
Honestly, you want to try it.

50:44.088 --> 50:45.089
Great.

50:53.014 --> 50:54.140
Hi.

50:55.266 --> 50:56.434
Hi.

51:00.480 --> 51:03.024
The trees are all
healthy and happy.

51:03.107 --> 51:05.109
That's great news.

51:05.193 --> 51:07.862
The first of the timber from
the Glenbogle sawmills
is loaded on the trucks.

51:10.990 --> 51:14.577
Paul, did you really
mean what you said earlier,
about Malcolm?

51:16.245 --> 51:18.373
You see, it's just because...

51:18.456 --> 51:21.000
Well, when he first arrived,

51:21.084 --> 51:24.420
you seemed to take it
a bit badly.

51:24.504 --> 51:29.217
Yeah, sorry, I often
react in ways that
don't make any sense.

51:29.300 --> 51:31.427
What can I say?
I'm complicated.

51:31.511 --> 51:33.429
Well, sometimes that's
excusable, if...

51:35.556 --> 51:37.892
If there's a lot
at stake, say.

51:37.975 --> 51:39.560
What do you mean?

51:39.644 --> 51:41.562
Malcolm's asked me
to marry him.

51:43.231 --> 51:46.651
Really? Uh, rainforest again,
is it?

51:46.734 --> 51:48.611
Or somewhere different
this time?

51:48.695 --> 51:50.488
He's serious, Paul.

51:54.033 --> 51:55.952
What did you tell him?

51:56.911 --> 51:59.706
Iona, come and dance with me.

52:15.179 --> 52:16.222
Paul.

52:16.305 --> 52:19.434
I know. None of my business.
