out of the complex this afternoon.

tomorrow morning at dawn.

What's our target?

00:09.593 --> 00:10.886
We won't know until we go.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.055
"We" won't know,
or you're not telling me?

00:13.264 --> 00:15.307
It's standard military procedure.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.643
You evaluate your target options
till the last minute

00:17.852 --> 00:19.729
and then you go with the best one.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.772
We've got all our eggs
in this basket, Dan.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.567
What if this weapon doesn't work?
Or what if it does?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.444
How do we know the Volm
won't turn it on us

00:26.652 --> 00:28.029
after they've
used it against the Espheni?

00:28.237 --> 00:29.947
- We don't.
- And you're okay with that?

00:30.156 --> 00:32.825
Madam President, you've seen
those streaks in the sky.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.952
The enemy defense grid
is already online.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.871

00:38.039 --> 00:40.332
If we don't knock out that grid,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.293
we're gonna be dead
in three months.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.296
The human race will cease to exist.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.715
Will the Volm weapon work?
I don't know.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.050
Will they end up being the friends

00:49.258 --> 00:50.426
we need them to be?
I don't know.

00:50.634 --> 00:54.180
All I know is that weapon represents
our only chance to win this war.

00:56.182 --> 00:57.308
If it works.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.769
I'll wait to cry until it doesn't.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.688
Meantime, my job is to get
these people ready for battle.

01:27.213 --> 01:30.174

an extraordinary visual palette.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.802
Too bad they're irradiating us.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.401
I heard you came strolling in.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.486
Good to see you.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.369
We need to talk.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.872

a good story to tell.

- I got a story.
- BEN: Dad.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.042
- It's not good.
- HAL: Dad!

02:47.251 --> 02:49.003
- Ben. Hal.
- You're not hurt?

02:49.211 --> 02:50.421
No.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.299
It's about time.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.183
Just give me a second, Dan.

We'll talk later.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.106
We waited for you
at Mechanicsville.

03:09.315 --> 03:10.482
You never showed.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.615
The Skitters were there at
the Picketts' farm when I went back.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.033
What happened to the Picketts?

03:19.450 --> 03:20.951
I don't know. They were gone.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.703
How come they didn't kill you?

03:22.912 --> 03:24.872
I wasn't part of the plan.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.168
They put me on a ship
and flew me to a tower.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.128
Karen.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.132
She's running the war from there.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.427
Is that where she took
Anne and Lexie?

03:40.387 --> 03:41.680
Yes.

Are they with you?

There's us. We're left.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.545

about Anne and Lexie?

04:13.754 --> 04:14.838
Yes.

you let me do the honors.

That's good. Use that.
That'll see you through.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.907
I got to go talk to Colonel Weaver.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.370
Dad, what are you saying?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.913
You told me that
if all we had left was hate,

04:48.080 --> 04:49.540
they'd already changed us.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.126
I know, Ben,
but that was a long time ago.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.086
Right now, all I've got is hate,

04:54.295 --> 04:56.171
and I don't plan on wasting it.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.550
We never even
considered Boston a target, Tom.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.719
We move out tomorrow.
Changing our plans now

05:01.927 --> 05:04.388
- would put us behind the eight ball.
- I understand your concerns, Dan,

05:04.596 --> 05:05.681
but until Karen took me there,

05:05.889 --> 05:07.433
we didn't know
she was headquartered in Boston.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.476
But we take out the Boston tower,

05:09.685 --> 05:11.812
we knock out the grid,
and we get Karen.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.231
- That tower's pretty well defended.
- It's surrounded by Mechs.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.358
There's a lot less resistance
at our current target.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.776
But we don't get Karen.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.113
We don't need to get Karen
to accomplish this objective.

05:21.322 --> 05:25.284
Gents, I damn near met my maker
trying to take that tower once.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.454
The thought of having a second shot
at it sort of makes me think

05:28.662 --> 05:30.622
it's not such a bad idea.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.003
A day and a half to get there,
at least.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.963
And we're gonna need a lot more
firepower to take on those Mechs.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.549
See, I don't think so. Since we took
out the Wakonda reactor,

05:40.758 --> 05:41.967
the Espheni are short on fuel.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.094
When I made my escape,
I saw their defenses.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.637
Those Mechs
are mostly inoperable.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.682
They're just standing there
like the Emperor's Terra Cotta army.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.893
You know,
I see the tactical advantages.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.395
We know that Karen controls
the Espheni defenses

05:53.604 --> 05:54.980
up and down the eastern seaboard.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.066
We take her out,
we cut the head off the snake.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.777
See, that's right.
That's exactly right.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.613
Tempting proposition,
Tom, but...

06:03.405 --> 06:04.740
I need a little time
to think about it.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.450
Whatever the target is,
I'd like to come along.

I'd like more, Tom.

You're worried.
Okay. I... I understand that.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.759
Let's lay our cards on the table.
For all you know,

06:23.967 --> 06:26.428
- Karen put a bug in me.
- She did it to you before.

06:26.637 --> 06:30.182
And I knew something was wrong,
and I told you that straight up.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.433
This is different.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.811
After what happened with Hal,
we can't take any chances.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.437
Well, just keep your eye on me.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.481
You know, if I do anything
even slightly abnormal,

06:37.689 --> 06:40.150
- put a bullet in my head.
- Tom, I don't want to.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.486
What we want and what we need
are two different things!

06:42.694 --> 06:45.489
We need to take out the grid,
and I need to get Karen!

06:45.697 --> 06:47.950
For Anne and for Lexie, please!

06:48.158 --> 06:49.701
And if I have to take a bullet,
I would rather...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.286
PORTER: That's enough!

06:51.495 --> 06:53.539
Now, Tom, thanks for
the updated intelligence,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.542

You're dismissed.

take a step back here.

we're going to find it,

and he's telling us the truth...

the key to victory.

continues to haunt me.

love gave me an edge.

that clouds our thinking.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.707
and I could not hold them.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.625
I cannot hold them in death.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.254
Hey, I'm here.
I'm... I'm right here with you.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.964
Listen, you can't let loss
break you, right?

11:54.172 --> 11:55.882
That's what you were
trying to tell me before.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.759
Hope is stronger than loss.

(GASPING)

12:00.762 --> 12:02.973
And the human spirit

12:03.181 --> 12:06.393
remains the most powerful
weapon on this planet.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.730
That is a gift.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.066
If you do not
allow it to be extinguished,

12:13.275 --> 12:15.652
it will carry you to victory.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.487
Let it carry you.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.494
In a short time, if not disturbed,

12:24.703 --> 12:27.456
my body will regenerate itself.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.458
You need do nothing.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.002
Okay, we'll make sure
you're not disturbed.

I... I hope we may restore...

12:44.014 --> 12:46.892
each other's hearts, Professor.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.729
I look forward to that day.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.870
Hey, everybody, get away from him.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.789
Let's keep everybody
away from him, too.

(DEVICE TICKING)

13:37.984 --> 13:39.945
Better get back below.
We're liable to have more casualties

13:40.153 --> 13:42.280
- before this is over.
- Yes, sir.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.535
MARINA: What happens
to the mission now?

13:46.743 --> 13:47.994
First, we got to put out the fires,

13:48.203 --> 13:50.121
get into the Volm complex,
see what's left of the weapon.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.957
And if you recover it,
have they picked a target?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.333
Has there been
a change of plans?

13:53.542 --> 13:54.876
Is it policy now that
my commanders

13:55.085 --> 13:56.378
convene a meeting
and I'm not involved?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.755
Keeping it close to the vest because
there's another mole on the loose.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.090
If it makes you feel any better,

14:00.298 --> 14:01.424
I don't know if there's been
a change of plans.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.135
I shared some information.
They sent me on my way.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.221
What will you do now?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.390
I don't want my old job back,
if that's what you're asking.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.850
If you did, I'd be
tempted to give it to you.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.560
The big chair's tough to fill.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.108
Hi. Thank you.

- Hey-
- Hey-

14:26.199 --> 14:29.160
Seems like this explosion
knocked over an anthill.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.495
Yeah.

14:30.704 --> 14:34.249
Everybody on the northern perimeter's
screaming for extra ammo

14:34.457 --> 14:36.209
in case we're
being set up for an attack.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.503
Yeah, same with
my guys on the east.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.590
Last I heard, though, no contact.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.344
Hey, uh...

14:47.554 --> 14:50.181
Did you hear about
Anne and my sister?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.310
Yeah.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.730
I'm sorry.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.026

- Where are you?
- I'm over here. I'm over here.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.032
- I'm over here.
- Hang on.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.954
Oh, you got a cut on your head.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.747
- I can't see.
- Hang on.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.333
Any better?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.294
Yeah, it's a little better.
You're still really blurry, though.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.546
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah, I think I... I think so.

16:03.755 --> 16:04.547
- Come on. Easy.
- Okay.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.926
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.803
- What happened?
- I don't know.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.305
Let's get you to the infirmary.
Can you walk?

16:12.514 --> 16:13.765
- (COUGHING) Yeah. I think so.
- Okay. Hang on to me.

Thanks.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.994
What did you hear?

16:34.202 --> 16:36.037
I don't know.
I can't tell if it's people.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.580
The sound bounces around
a lot down there.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.792
Well, that you can hear through
40 feet of rock is miracle enough.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.502
The key is we stay methodical.

how we could get a better picture

18:00.455 --> 18:02.290
- of what's going on below.
- Speak up, son.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.209
Well, I thought that maybe
if we went through the storm drains,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.961
- then Ben could hear better.
- Good idea. Make it happen.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.588
- Okay. Come on.
- Okay.

work so hard.

get this Volm show on the road,

we're all gonna be maggot meat
in three months.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.890
What did the, uh, spikeboy say?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.517
Probably more survivors
down there.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.143
Most likely, it's the cafeteria.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.271
Well, that's good, right?
That's where they all congregate.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.400
Listen. If it held up,
I'm sure your daughter,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.319
she's down there
with that bunch.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.073
Look easy, all right.
We don't need to borrow any trouble.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.450
Now, if the kid's right,
we are 20 feet away

18:37.659 --> 18:39.410
from that northern stairwell,
all right?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.704
And if that's clear,
then it's straight down,

18:41.913 --> 18:43.206
straight shot, 30 feet.

- Right.

- She's still alive.
- Thank God.

- How bad is it?
- I don't know.

Your dad's a survivor.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.441
Wherever he is,
he's just as worried about you.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.443

We'll get out of this.

- The floor plan.

totally blocked with rubble.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.410
We can't get through.
Now, I've sent people to take a look

20:02.619 --> 20:05.580
at the elevator shafts here,
here, and here.

20:05.788 --> 20:06.998
What about these north exits?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.708
I haven't had the people
to get over there, Tom.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.668
Well, we could do that.
Find me a weapon, would you?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.253
Yeah.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.964
- How is she?
- Probable concussion.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.507
- What about Lourdes?
- Same.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.259
All we can do is
monitor her till she wakes up.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.552
- Go.
- Okay.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.762
- Go.
- Here.

- Hmm.

lock me in a dark closet for hours.

- We're not letting it stop us.

You're gonna need a forklift
to clear this out.

their way to us as we speak.

way more than that.

isn't gonna remove this problem

23:26.656 --> 23:28.741
That was family. I had to go.

brought me with you.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.775
You are one of the wounded.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.736
I don't want you leaving that bed.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.321
Don't worry. We've got it covered.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.739
He's right.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.825
You should get some rest. We'll get
you out of here as soon as we can.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.577
Tom, was the mole behind this?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.538
(SIGHS) It's possible.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.582
So many people killed.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.083
Everything we worked
for destroyed.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.836
We don't know that. It could
look a lot worse from down here.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.215
Tom, I'm...

25:08.132 --> 25:11.052
I'm really sorry
about Anne and Lexie.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.889
I guess everyone's
been saying that to you.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.808
That... That's okay.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.646
I... I can't help feeling that
it's my fault somehow.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.065
I... You asked me to
keep an eye on them.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.108
Don't do that to yourself.
There's no way you could have

25:26.317 --> 25:28.027
anticipated what happened.
Nobody could have.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.655
It's just Anne gave me so much,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.699
and to think that after
everything we went through,

25:33.908 --> 25:35.993
she died alone
right back where we started.

25:36.369 --> 25:37.662
After all we went...

25:40.581 --> 25:43.167
Yeah, you can't
dwell on that, though.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.379
Anne wouldn't want you to.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.090
(SNIFFLING) Yeah, you're right.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.300
Good. Get some rest.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.403
(BOTH GRUNTING)

26:22.415 --> 26:23.749

26:23.958 --> 26:26.877
All this work, and we're
right back where we started.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.090
Just like this whole damn war.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.925
That's funny to you?

26:35.595 --> 26:38.514
(DRY CHUCKLE) Come on, Hal.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.100
It's not that bad.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.729
You think it hurts to be dead?

26:46.522 --> 26:48.816
It's living that hurts.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.279
Dead is easy.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.489
I can't let that happen, Maggie.

26:56.324 --> 26:57.825
I got to stop it.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.829
Some things
are out of our control.

27:04.415 --> 27:05.791
Yeah.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.210
And I can't stand it.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.673
(LAUGHING)

27:12.882 --> 27:14.925
This is my fault.
You understand?

27:17.428 --> 27:20.765
(GASPING) Out of my control...
Maybe.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.601
Sure, I had a bug.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.897
And I don't remember it.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.941
But I could have
planted a bomb...

27:32.735 --> 27:34.111
Or bombs.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.033
Whether I was
in control or not...

27:41.786 --> 27:43.537
I betrayed
everybody I cared about.

27:46.582 --> 27:50.294
All these people died...
because of me.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.924
You...

27:55.132 --> 27:56.842
You're gonna die...

27:58.886 --> 28:00.388
Because of me.

That's funny.

28:22.618 --> 28:26.122
- Hey-
- Hey-

28:27.540 --> 28:29.875
Nobody ever cared about me.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.796
Not like you do.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.678
If this is my time...

28:43.222 --> 28:46.392
(WHISPERING) ...I can't think of
anyone else I'd rather go outwith.

- You almost done?

29:09.623 --> 29:11.459
Yeah. Just about.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.754
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

29:15.504 --> 29:18.883
There's a crack in the support beam
right over my head.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.303
- Is that a problem?
- It depends on whether

29:22.511 --> 29:24.555
its load-bearing capacity's
been compromised.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.724
Our explosion could punch right
through to the stairwell

29:26.932 --> 29:29.602
or it could collapse the ceiling
and bury the hall in rubble.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.898
We'll need to rethink this,
perhaps find another location.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.902
Great. We're right back
where we started.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.200
What did you just say?

29:44.408 --> 29:46.660
I said, "We're right back
where we're started."

30:03.010 --> 30:04.261
- What are you doing?
- I was just checking.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
Never mind that. Anthony's hurt.
I need your help.

- Oh, okay.
- Come on.

Get up. Slowly.

- Tom, what is this?
- Do it.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.870
I don't understand.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.497
- I want to see that med pack.
- Why, Tom?

30:31.705 --> 30:33.582
'Cause it's just like the one
you sent with us to Keystone,

30:33.791 --> 30:35.209
and I think you put
a tracking device in it.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.920
No, I...
It was just a med pack, Tom.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.130
- You're acting crazy.
- Am I?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.633
You said it was sad that
Anne died back where she started.

30:42.842 --> 30:43.884
Yes, it was the thought of her...

30:44.093 --> 30:45.469
- You meant Boston.
- Of course. I was just...

30:45.678 --> 30:47.346
I told Porter and I told Weaver
where she died!

30:47.555 --> 30:49.765
I didn't tell anybody else.
How did you know?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.058
(STAMMERING) I just assumed...

30:51.267 --> 30:53.727
Why weren't you in the infirmary
when the blast went off?

30:53.936 --> 30:55.479
Were you trying to get out
after you planted the bomb?

30:55.688 --> 30:57.439
No! I was... No.
What...

30:57.648 --> 30:59.358
Tom, you're frightening me.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.485
What were you doing in Cochise's room
when I explicitly said

31:01.694 --> 31:04.154
- that everybody should stay out?!
- He's a patient! I'm a doctor!

31:04.363 --> 31:05.406
Then show me what's in that pack!

31:05.614 --> 31:07.283
Don't you see
what the mole is doing to us?

31:07.491 --> 31:08.701
You're the mole!

31:08.909 --> 31:10.452
I asked you to
keep an eye on Anne and Lexie,

31:10.661 --> 31:12.955
and you delivered them
right to Karen!

31:29.471 --> 31:30.723
BEN: Okay.

31:35.853 --> 31:38.564
I thought I'd hear more down here,
but I'm getting nothing.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.236
I'm worried.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.114
So am I. They...
they could all be dead.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.200
Maybe that wouldn't be so bad.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.789
Dad's lost it. I don't know
what Karen did to him.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.250
But she did something.
It changed him.

you'd change, too.

to die down here, not like this.

she can't kill.

of something like that.

Of course not.
It wasn't her.

get an implant in her.

are gonna be able to forgive her
for all the people she's killed?

haven't even forgiven me.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.210
As a team.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.921
Yeah. As a team.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.647
TOM: It's good to see you
back on your feet, my friend.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.652
My comrades... gone.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.615
Like me, they never
laid eyes upon their homeland.

39:28.325 --> 39:31.953
And now to die here
in a strange land.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.414
- Forgotten.
- I won't forget them.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.709
Or why they gave their lives.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.962
We'll make sure
they didn't die in vain.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.091
It is too late.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.097
You built your weapon in a bunker

39:50.305 --> 39:52.474
designed to withstand
a Beamer attack.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.601
Isn't it possible that it survived?

39:55.519 --> 39:57.020
It most certainly did.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.816
But it is buried
beneath that wreckage,

40:01.024 --> 40:03.944
and all of my engineers are dead.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.614
I do not possess the technical
expertise to operate it.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.367
Well, maybe Dr. Kadar could help.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.995
He's a very quick study.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.873
I think he'd see it
as a bit of a challenge.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.042
It is a long shot, at best.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.712
What's the alternative?

40:24.047 --> 40:25.298
Come on.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.010
First, we bury our dead,

40:29.219 --> 40:31.346
and then we start digging
like there's no tomorrow.
