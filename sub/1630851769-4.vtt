WEBVTT

00:13.179 --> 00:14.514
- When I look at you,
I see your mother.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.182
Hopefully his hardship
at a moment's notice.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.767
- I wanted him to kiss me.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.686
Now whenever I try
to touch him, he goes cold.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.854
You're my sync bait.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.147
- Okay.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.524
- You sure she's not
in your house?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.026
- Your friend shows his face
on our block again,

00:26.067 --> 00:27.444
I'll rip his gay
little earring off.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.529
- Told you what I'd do--
- Stop!

00:29.571 --> 00:31.322
- There is something
out in those woods

00:31.364 --> 00:32.574
hunting for livestock.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.617
- I'll be the lure.
Let's kill this thing.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.495
- This is not gold.
It's the only way to kill them.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.581
Remember how I said
that the wrong person

00:39.622 --> 00:41.750
could open up a new door,
let all the nightmares out.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.711
Well, I think it might
have done just that.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.594
- This is nuts.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.388
- Take his mask off.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.558
- You take his mask off,
bro.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.686
I'm your superior.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.905
- Whoa-ho-ho!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.494
That's crazy!

01:18.620 --> 01:19.871
- Sick.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.500
You think he's from the Colony?

01:23.541 --> 01:25.710
- I don't know.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.297
- Damn.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.111
- Yo, yo!

01:51.152 --> 01:52.862
Check this out.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.324
That's gold, dude.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.541
- No, what--

02:06.835 --> 02:10.380
- Hey, let's move this body
before the cops get here.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.466
All right? If we can keep
this thing a secret...

02:13.508 --> 02:16.261
we might have just found
our retirement savings.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.847
Grab his legs.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.224
- Yeah. Let's move him
so nobody finds the gold.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.143
- Yeah. Yeah, bud.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.622
- She was a boss, right?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.084
- She's beautiful.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.378
- Miss her every day.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.547
- Me too.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.759
Mine left when I was five,
so...

04:19.801 --> 04:22.137
she's sort of faceless
in my memories.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.972
- You know where she went?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.309
- I know she stopped in Salem.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.229
- Oh. Puzzle comes together.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.107
- So you think
you're pretty smart, huh?

04:34.149 --> 04:37.152
- Yeah. I do. I am.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.279
- Hey, kids,

04:39.320 --> 04:42.032
it's chaos at the mine.
Chaos.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.325
You should see these photos
my people sent.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.161
- Airdrop them to me.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.537
- Oh, rhetorical, baby.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.040
I'm not trying to give you
more PTSD. Carrie--

04:50.081 --> 04:53.126
- I'd like to stay
a few more days anyway.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.878
For the pancakes.

04:54.919 --> 04:58.590
- Ten points.
New favorite daughter.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.802
- He can close access
to that tear in the mine.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.764
- If he finds out that we were
down there, he'll murder us.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.682
Straight up.
Like, worse than the--

05:07.724 --> 05:09.309
- The Bloodherd of Gehenna.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.643
We need to close it.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.146
If that crack grows big enough

05:13.188 --> 05:15.482
for the Herd to slip through,

05:15.523 --> 05:18.193
that would be the end...

05:18.234 --> 05:20.820
of at least West Pine.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.824
- Well, there are worse fates.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.535
Kidding. All right. Sorry.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
Hi.
Hello, how's your family?

05:48.306 --> 05:49.516
- Nana's always cleaning up

05:49.557 --> 05:50.892
in her new white people
Mahjong league.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.436
Oh, sorry. You meant
the kidnapped, tortured ones?

05:53.478 --> 05:55.355
- You don't have to
always deflect.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.648
- They're delusional.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.941
Feverish. Shaking.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.984
They don't remember
their names, they...

06:00.026 --> 06:01.611
keep waking up screaming.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.406
- It'll get better.
- I worship your optimism.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.451
- Hey.
- Just--

06:09.411 --> 06:10.537
Sorry. I just--

06:10.578 --> 06:12.455
- You're in your no touch zone.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.790
- I don't have
a "no touch zone."

06:13.832 --> 06:17.377
Y-you just don't need to
pet me like a sad cat, I--

06:17.419 --> 06:19.462
Grr. Right?
Big dog alpha dog.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.256
Strong for Tasha.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.590
- Why do you think I need that?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.342
- I don't know.
You're your dad's daughter.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.428
- Dude, I only have care for
you, but this hot-cold thing

06:26.469 --> 06:29.723
is making me feel like my head
is cafeteria clam chowder.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.766
Just tell me your boundaries,
and I'll act the part.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.977
- I don't have boundaries.
- Okay. Sure.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.771
I'm gonna go see what I can
find on my dad's computer.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.921
- So, any thoughts
on closing the Door?

07:07.635 --> 07:10.722
So, Armageddon.
Glad to see it.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.643
- At the Colony, we were made
to repress our nature.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.979
Our worth was defined

07:18.021 --> 07:21.941
by how much we aligned
with their teachings.

07:21.983 --> 07:26.112
- Bleak, Carrie.
That's terrible.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.448
- Tasha's not like that.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.576
You can tell her
whatever it is you're hiding.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.411
- Are you like, the Terminator,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.789
sent here
to like, blow up my spot?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.750
- You like each other.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.217
- She's perfect.
I just...

07:47.258 --> 07:50.595
I feel like sometimes she...
wants me to like

07:50.637 --> 07:52.222
play this role of like

07:52.263 --> 07:57.102
a made-for-TV boyfriend
or something.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.440
Sorry, this isn't
Colony-ripe material.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.734
- I'm listening.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.032
- There are good guys
in the world.

08:11.074 --> 08:18.206
But...when I think of manhood
when it comes to me...

08:18.248 --> 08:23.670
God, I just see this big agro
muscly troll that's like--

08:23.712 --> 08:27.549
like wrastling
with the other boys or--

08:27.590 --> 08:30.760
and I visibly
don't relate to that.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.681
I like...I don't know.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.225
I like laying in the rain,

08:37.267 --> 08:41.604
listening to a sad song
like some small-town clichÃ©.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.276
W-we do that stuff together,

08:46.317 --> 08:52.657
and it's the most at home
that I could feel.

08:52.699 --> 08:57.162
So, when she treats me like...

08:57.203 --> 09:00.874
like boyfriend material,
it just--it makes me...

09:00.915 --> 09:03.084
wanna sprint for the hills.

09:05.879 --> 09:11.134
- I have to cross
my eyes to see you as a boy.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.178
Hey, no offense.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.806
At the Colony,
we judge on spirit, not on sex.

09:16.848 --> 09:21.936
- No, the--thank you.

09:23.438 --> 09:28.318
I can't imagine
telling a West Piner that...

09:31.613 --> 09:33.782
I'm non-binary.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.912
They...

09:38.953 --> 09:41.623
they hate me
and my family anyway.

09:41.664 --> 09:46.086
So, Tasha deserves better
than my problems.

09:46.127 --> 09:50.840
- Sometimes I feel like
I exist too much.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.259
It makes me bitter.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.387
- Me too.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.433
So let's not be bitter.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.938
- Guys, you should see this.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.904
- Good job. Keep it up.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.623
- I don't think Carrie
killed the disciples.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.834
One of the Bloodherd escaped
with her.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.920
She must have stayed behind
in West Pine to stop it.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.256
And even if she never
comes back,

10:31.297 --> 10:33.675
it won't stop our numbers
from dwindling.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.515
- It's an orgy of vanity
out there.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.517
There's no discipline.

10:42.559 --> 10:47.647
And without discipline,
we fall prey to the Herd.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.650
They need us
to be what they can't.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.485
That's why we remain vigilant.

10:52.527 --> 10:57.365
The disciples alone
must carry the light.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.619
Let the council
worry about the Herd.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.622
You bring me my daughter.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.792
I'm losing patience.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.919
- I just ask you to
spare her the worst.

11:12.130 --> 11:16.509
- She's a traitor like her mom.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.845
She deserves no mercy.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.601
- Look at these photos
that were sent to my dad.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.810
- This isn't a monster.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.978
- So who did we kill?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.855
- You both saw it.
It was a beast.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.816
- I personally was
tripping face. So--

11:31.858 --> 11:33.443
- I've seen them dead before.
In Gehenna.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.487
It was a beast.
This makes no sense.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.780
- And listen to this.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.033
"DNA of kidnapper
linked to a cold case suspect

11:40.075 --> 11:42.160
from 60 years ago."

11:42.202 --> 11:43.703
- I don't--I don't understand.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.372
- Sounds like no one does.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.749
But we're with you
either way, Carrie.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.209
- More importantly,
on to the tear.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.170
This guy's been trying to
get into my pants forever.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.882
- We love that for you.
- And oh, boy, lucky for me,

11:55.924 --> 11:57.550
he's our key
to closing this crack

11:57.592 --> 11:59.803
before anything else gets out.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.432
- Ha ha.
I didn't wear my helmet.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.059
- Yo!

12:13.900 --> 12:17.362
Yo, check it out.
Gallery eight.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.408
I know it's a no-drill site,
but this vein, buddy.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.368
- Geologist verify this?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.994
- That's gold, Khal.

12:25.036 --> 12:29.708
Yo, if we keep this hush,
Jeff's mortgage, your debt--

12:29.749 --> 12:31.626
Right?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.254
Come on,
the boys need this, bro.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.759
- Keep access tight.
Don't tell anybody.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.177
We gotta play this smart.
Understand?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.595
- Mm-hmm.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.180
- All right.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.772
- Ha ha ha.
I didn't wear my helmet.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.861
Yo, yo.
What up? What up?

12:57.902 --> 13:01.406
Like an angel dropped in.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.408
- Yo, my dad says
you were the one

13:03.450 --> 13:04.451
who found
the drifter in the mines.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.995
- I mean, hey,
they don't call me

13:07.037 --> 13:09.289
Big Dick Boy
for nothing, right?

13:09.330 --> 13:11.624
- Well, I definitely
need the scoop.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.964
Hey, you there?

13:21.718 --> 13:25.638
Spoons, hello?
- Uh...

13:25.680 --> 13:28.141
Yo, I'm at work, mama.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.977
Dance with me
at O'Malley's bonfire tonight

13:31.019 --> 13:32.854
and I'll give you
the juice, okay?

13:32.896 --> 13:35.190
- Whatever. Just be there.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.116
- No.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.681
- All right, folks.
We earned this.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.558
- I don't know
if I should be here.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.018
- Yeah, I don't think that
I should--

14:12.060 --> 14:13.353
- Don't wanna hear it.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.188
Nolan, the reason
they're so hard on you

14:15.230 --> 14:17.232
is because they think
you're way better than them.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.610
Carrie, suck it up
and pour it down. To us.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.866
- Mm--
- Mm...

14:26.908 --> 14:28.034
- Ugh!
- Oh!

14:28.076 --> 14:29.369
both: Burns so good.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.455
- Oh my God, oh my God.
- No.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.623
- Show me your moves!
- No, no, no, no.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.208
- Show me a little bit
of your moves.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.876
- But I don't know if West
Piner's ready for the...

14:36.918 --> 14:38.670
the fire hydrant freak.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.380
- Oh, West Pine. pump it up!

14:40.422 --> 14:43.675
- I think we should go talk
to your friend.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.511
- He's not here yet.
Join us.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.014
- I don't know how.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.473
- One of us!
- Neither do we.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.475
- One of us!
- Carrie, you can do it.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.311
- Like a...
- Like a...like a...like a...

14:55.353 --> 14:58.064
Oh! Okay.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.900
Oh!
- Oh!

15:00.942 --> 15:02.277
- Whoa--oh my God.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.113
Yeah, okay.
- Keep going, keep going.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.407
- Tasha.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.034
- The Colony
doesn't use phones.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.121
- Do it...
- Like a...

15:58.291 --> 16:01.419
- Tasha.
Baby, you home?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.346
Babe?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.620
- Like, actually--actually
move your hips.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.665
Here. Like, like--
Yeah, like that.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.667
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.585
You gotta get into it.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.675
- Spoons.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.682
- Damn.
Hey, if I told you

16:55.724 --> 16:59.352
you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

16:59.394 --> 17:02.272
- Your boss, my dad, might.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.190
- He would hold your beautiful
body against me?

17:04.232 --> 17:05.775
- Ew.
Why haven't they shut down

17:05.817 --> 17:07.318
Gallery eight at the mine?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.737
It was flagged for closure.

17:08.778 --> 17:12.532
- Why don't you ask your pops?
- I'm asking you.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.201
- I think you
might owe me a dance

17:15.243 --> 17:16.995
for that kind of information.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.080
- She was asking about
the gallery.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.042
- And who are you?

17:22.083 --> 17:25.628
- She's my cousin.
Step-cousin.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.506
- Right. Well, look.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.676
Normally, we do control blasts
to cave in a stripped tunnel.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.345
We can't do that
with Gallery eight

17:33.386 --> 17:35.555
'cause we'd risk caving
in the creek bed above.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.557
I thought you wanted juice
on the dead body--

17:37.599 --> 17:39.726
- So, how do we close it then?

17:39.768 --> 17:41.227
- We don't.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.937
If we collapse it,
we flood the whole mine.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.356
So it's just sitting there.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.775
Why? What, are you doing,
re-con for the Frisks?

17:50.445 --> 17:53.156
- There's dark stuff
going on down there,

17:53.198 --> 17:54.783
and you have to close it
or more people

17:54.824 --> 17:57.160
are going to be hurt.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.412
Didn't you feel it
when you were down there?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.331
There's something's off.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.628
- Nah.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.130
Look, I don't know what kind of
fufi shit you're on about,

18:09.172 --> 18:12.759
but between us, that tunnel
has a vein worth some money.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.261
No one's shutting that puppy,
all right?

18:15.303 --> 18:17.764
Lawsuit or otherwise.

18:17.806 --> 18:23.019
Now, I am gonna get cleaned up,
and I'd love that dance.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.355
Hmm?

19:39.679 --> 19:40.805
Aah!

20:17.425 --> 20:19.427
- Aah!

20:30.522 --> 20:33.817
- Easy, girl.
You'll regret it tomorrow.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.738
- I have to go back.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.700
I have to get the Ledger.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.911
- Where? What's the Ledger?

20:44.953 --> 20:49.541
- It's this book of terrible
secrets kept behind the Door.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.252
Since we can't close down
the mine, I've gotta get it.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.421
It'll tell us
how to close the tear.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.301
Will you dance with me?

21:03.638 --> 21:07.976
I might die tomorrow.
I probably will.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.940
- Keep drinking like this,
you will.

21:16.651 --> 21:20.613
- Come on. Dance with me.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.493
- You ever slow-danced before?
- Mm-mm.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.341
- I'm gone.
- Stay. Please.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.845
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry
about your family, man.

21:43.887 --> 21:47.474
Really. I don't like 'em,
but the news is rough.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.478
- Thanks, I guess.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.980
- You paint your nails
yourself?

21:54.022 --> 21:56.941
Is that--
what shade do you call that?

21:58.109 --> 22:02.489
- Mint sorbet.
- Pretty.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.742
You know what that is?
I got that helping

22:05.784 --> 22:09.037
Gavin Keen sand the molding
in his new garage.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.290
You see that?

22:14.042 --> 22:19.381
That's West Piners look out
for each other for life.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.550
I'm still here being like
my dad and his dad

22:22.592 --> 22:26.971
and his dad's dad's dad's,
all the way back...

22:27.013 --> 22:30.433
while you can do
whatever you want.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.729
You're free.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.148
- We all help our friends out.

22:37.190 --> 22:41.569
And I promise you, I'm not
living some liberated life.

22:41.611 --> 22:45.865
- I admire it, honestly.

22:48.118 --> 22:50.829
- My parents would trade me in
for a model like you.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.622
- Model like me?

22:53.915 --> 23:00.046
- Like...a guy.
They don't get me.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.007
- No, I hear that.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.055
Can I read you a poem I wrote?

23:09.097 --> 23:14.561
These guys don't understand,
but...maybe you might.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.153
"Sometimes my parents
make me sad" by Rhys Whelan.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.199
"Sometimes my parents
make me sad.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.369
"And when I'm sad, I feel bad.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.706
"I poop my pants and do a dance
and then I get real glad.

23:34.748 --> 23:37.167
Buddy. Sit the fuck down.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.252
You know what my dad would do
if I came home

23:39.294 --> 23:41.046
with mint sorbet nails?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.964
Know what he'd do?

23:43.006 --> 23:45.133
He would make me
feel bad about it.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.097
- You wanna act pretty
like your mom?

23:51.139 --> 23:52.849
Faggot.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.144
Don't scream for your friends
or I'll fuck you up.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.774
- You're not supposed to look
this sad while slow-dancing.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.109
- You look so serious.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.570
- You did say
you might die tomorrow.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.530
- It's just another day
in my life.

24:07.572 --> 24:10.700
- Mm! Typical morning.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.453
Squat Challenge.
Yogurt parfait. Shower.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.247
Die.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.292
- It's dark.
- So dark.

24:22.629 --> 24:26.341
There you go.
So, you have done this before.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.760
- You just make it easy.

24:28.802 --> 24:32.138
- Well, I feel safe with you.

24:32.180 --> 24:35.141
- You are safe with me.

24:45.193 --> 24:48.279
- One day, you're gonna tell
all the people you meet

24:48.321 --> 24:49.489
about your shit little town

24:49.531 --> 24:51.908
and how your mom
did a good thing once.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.912
Go home.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.211
- Uhh--

25:34.284 --> 25:36.745
- Nolan, I'm sorry.
I've got no excuse.

25:36.786 --> 25:40.749
Nolan, please come back.
I--

25:49.174 --> 25:50.675
Nolan?

25:53.178 --> 25:54.763
Nolan?

26:00.226 --> 26:04.314
Nolan? Guys?

26:12.864 --> 26:17.243
Spoons, what?
Did the toilet eat you up?

26:17.285 --> 26:18.661
Hello?

26:23.083 --> 26:26.002
- Oh, God,
Are you getting off right now?

26:30.965 --> 26:31.925
- Hello?

26:45.313 --> 26:47.148
- I'm sorry.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.030
Nolan.

26:57.617 --> 27:01.079
Nolan, I'm sorry--

27:01.121 --> 27:04.249
- It's over, Carrie.
You lost.

27:13.008 --> 27:16.094
- Spoons, you in here?

27:37.073 --> 27:38.992
Spoons?

27:46.416 --> 27:49.753
- Aah!

28:00.638 --> 28:01.890
Help me!
