00:55.109 --> 00:58.242
Ah. Here's a new specimen.

00:58.342 --> 01:00.042
Dinobot, come on.

01:00.142 --> 01:02.542
You're supposed to be assisting.

01:02.642 --> 01:05.543
Of course.

01:05.643 --> 01:10.044
Pardon my lack of enthusiasm for a bunch of worthless weeds.

01:10.144 --> 01:13.478
You realize that we are targets out here?

01:13.578 --> 01:14.878
Targets!

01:14.978 --> 01:19.712
And still you stop to smell the roses.

01:19.812 --> 01:21.213
Oh, whatever.

( exhales )

01:23.313 --> 01:24.546
( sighs )

01:24.646 --> 01:28.581
Dinobot, I signed on for this mission as an explorer.

01:28.681 --> 01:30.781
Just because we bumped into Predacons

01:30.881 --> 01:33.848
is no reason to stop learning new things.

01:33.948 --> 01:37.949
Well, if we encounter any of Megatron's forces,

01:38.049 --> 01:42.449
you may learn that it is unwise to dally with plants.

01:42.549 --> 01:45.883
We should be devising battle strategies.

01:45.983 --> 01:47.584
Knowledge of the territory

01:47.684 --> 01:49.917
can be an advantage in battle, Dinobot.

01:50.017 --> 01:51.951
You're a soldier, you should know that.

01:52.051 --> 01:56.385
I somehow doubt this plant will be a turning point.

01:56.485 --> 01:58.419
But very well.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.219
If have it you must, stand aside.

02:01.319 --> 02:03.453
I'll blast it out.

02:03.552 --> 02:07.353
Dinobot, maxim--

02:07.453 --> 02:10.954
Hold on. Hold on.

02:17.589 --> 02:19.889
( grunts )

02:22.256 --> 02:24.623
You see, it is possible

02:24.723 --> 02:27.357
to look for non-violent solutions first.

02:27.457 --> 02:29.424
Perhaps.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.691
But I think you've lost your battle edge, Optimus.

02:32.791 --> 02:35.058
In our fight against Megatron,

02:35.158 --> 02:37.859
there is nothing you can learn

02:37.959 --> 02:40.559
from this worthless weed.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.326

02:50.094 --> 02:52.395
Get this thing off me!

02:52.495 --> 02:54.061
I can't reach it.

02:54.161 --> 02:56.762
Get it off!

02:57.895 --> 03:01.629
Hold on. Hold on.

03:01.729 --> 03:03.696
( chuckling )

03:03.796 --> 03:08.463
Got you right in the one place you can't reach, didn't it?

03:12.498 --> 03:16.198
You see, that's how it spreads its seed.

03:16.298 --> 03:17.865
We've learned something.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.866
Yes.

03:20.966 --> 03:24.967
From now on, I shoot my dinner salad before I eat it.

03:25.066 --> 03:27.533
Hm. We'll need to find another specimen.

03:27.633 --> 03:28.633
( both gasp )

03:28.733 --> 03:31.834
How about an arachnid?

03:33.968 --> 03:35.934
Optimus, maximize!

03:36.034 --> 03:39.435
Dinobot, maximize!

04:04.839 --> 04:06.340

04:06.440 --> 04:10.408
I have a special cyber bee just for you, Optimus Primal.

04:10.508 --> 04:13.141
Enjoy!

Optimus.

04:35.811 --> 04:37.812
( grunting )

04:43.279 --> 04:45.880
You were supposed to be his backup.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.580
We were ambushed.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.814
And don't tell me my duty, fur ball,

04:51.914 --> 04:56.982
or you shall soon be occupying several recycling bins.

04:57.082 --> 05:00.382
Grr, wanna try it now, lizard lips?

05:00.482 --> 05:03.416
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, here.

05:03.516 --> 05:07.250
As much as I'd love to see youse scrap yourselves,

05:07.350 --> 05:09.817
eh, save it for my birthday.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.785
Right now we got bigger concerns.

05:12.885 --> 05:14.851
( ominous theme playing )

05:17.885 --> 05:20.752
Rhinox, what's the sitch?

05:20.852 --> 05:25.219
Looks like a viral mine has fused with his net core.

05:25.319 --> 05:28.620
He can't transform while the thing's attached.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.554
Well, then let's get it off.

05:30.654 --> 05:34.121
He took enough energon damage just getting back here.

05:34.221 --> 05:35.688
Can't be done.

05:35.788 --> 05:39.588
The mine's rerouted all his life support functions to itself.

05:39.688 --> 05:43.723
We yank it, he lives for less than a minute.

05:43.823 --> 05:45.923
Whoa, that's bad.

05:46.023 --> 05:47.323
Gets worse.

05:47.424 --> 05:50.057
Right after that, the mine explodes,

05:50.157 --> 05:53.391
taking out everyone within sprinting distance.

05:53.491 --> 05:56.158
Man, I don't get it.

05:56.258 --> 05:58.259
Why? For what?

05:58.359 --> 06:02.526
A viral mine, you say?

06:02.626 --> 06:05.193
I know Scorponok's creations.

06:05.293 --> 06:09.393
This one is intended to turn our leader into a coward.

06:09.493 --> 06:12.161
One who'll lead us to defeat.

06:12.261 --> 06:15.895
Only Scorponok will have the anti-virus.

06:15.995 --> 06:18.562
There's gotta be a way to put the skids on.

06:18.662 --> 06:20.328
( thudding ) Huh?

06:20.429 --> 06:22.430
( thudding )

06:23.663 --> 06:25.029
( gasps )

06:27.296 --> 06:28.696
Ah.

06:31.631 --> 06:35.031
All right. Who wants some?

06:35.131 --> 06:36.998
( dramatic theme playing )

06:39.665 --> 06:44.065
Nobody takes it off. Understand?

06:45.499 --> 06:47.067
You hear me?

06:47.167 --> 06:49.967
I'll blow your slagging heads off!

06:50.066 --> 06:52.467
Hm... No, big bot!

06:52.567 --> 06:53.667
( gasps )

06:53.767 --> 06:54.901
( grunts )

06:55.001 --> 06:56.468
Hold on there.

06:56.568 --> 06:57.835
( grunting )

06:57.935 --> 06:59.436
Get off of me!

06:59.536 --> 07:03.469
Yes. Listen to him.

07:03.569 --> 07:07.336
I don't fear you.

07:07.437 --> 07:09.670
I don't fear any of you!

07:09.770 --> 07:11.104
I thought that thing

07:11.204 --> 07:13.471
was supposed to turn him into a coward.

07:13.571 --> 07:16.638
No doubt that was its intention.

07:16.738 --> 07:20.906
But Scorponok is notoriously incompetent.

07:21.006 --> 07:26.072
I would say instead that we have a berserker.

07:26.173 --> 07:28.606
Interesting.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.374
Optimus can beat it.

07:30.474 --> 07:32.908
Come on, big bot. Fight against it.

07:33.008 --> 07:35.608
You can do it. Please.

07:35.707 --> 07:40.042
It's too much. I can't-- Can't fight it.

07:40.142 --> 07:42.142
Disarm my weapons.

07:42.242 --> 07:43.609
Lock me up.

07:43.709 --> 07:45.177
( gasps )

07:45.276 --> 07:46.876
( dramatic theme playing )

07:53.211 --> 07:54.344
( gasps )

07:54.445 --> 07:56.211
Ah, Scorponok.

07:56.311 --> 07:59.379
Yes. I've been waiting for your report.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.146
Uh, I stuck it to him, Megatron.

08:03.245 --> 08:04.779
And good.

08:04.879 --> 08:07.013
Hm, excellent.

08:07.113 --> 08:09.080
And the anti-virus?

08:09.181 --> 08:11.947
Just one. Like you said.

08:12.047 --> 08:13.414
Right behind you.

08:13.514 --> 08:15.347
Ah.

08:15.448 --> 08:17.382
( chuckling )

08:17.482 --> 08:19.615
By now, Optimus Primal

08:19.715 --> 08:23.483
has most assuredly exchanged his courage

08:23.582 --> 08:26.383
for a nice cowardly yellow stripe.

08:26.483 --> 08:27.917
Yes.

08:28.017 --> 08:30.317
But he will not want to stay that way.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.617
No.

08:31.717 --> 08:34.784
So when he leads his misguided mechanoids

08:34.884 --> 08:36.784
on a futile raid for this anti-virus,

08:36.884 --> 08:41.553
it will be their final battle in the Beast Wars.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.719
( grunting )

08:43.820 --> 08:45.820
( dramatic theme playing )

08:49.020 --> 08:51.987
What do you want?

08:52.087 --> 08:53.421
Cheetor.

08:53.521 --> 08:55.354
Cheetor.

08:55.455 --> 08:59.022
I'm sorry. It's hard to control.

09:01.689 --> 09:04.656
Is there any of the old Optimus left?

09:04.756 --> 09:07.356
Yes. Some.

09:07.457 --> 09:09.091
Don't let it go, big bot.

09:09.190 --> 09:12.224
Don't let this thing tweak you out of control.

09:12.324 --> 09:14.658
I don't know

09:14.758 --> 09:18.125
if I can beat it.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.459
But I think I can adapt to it.

09:21.559 --> 09:24.093
Maybe hold this aggression down.

09:24.193 --> 09:27.393
Even use it to our advantage.

09:27.493 --> 09:29.593
Really? I knew it.

09:29.693 --> 09:33.194
You hang too tough to be dropped by any techno flu.

09:33.294 --> 09:34.694
Let's do it.

09:34.794 --> 09:39.195
What do you mean, use it to our advantage?

09:39.295 --> 09:42.296
Optimus is a war machine.

09:42.396 --> 09:44.930
I say we point him in the right direction,

09:45.030 --> 09:46.996
give him full armament,

09:47.097 --> 09:49.831
and then unleash him upon the Predacons.

09:49.930 --> 09:54.931
If we want the anti-virus, that is the only way to get it.

09:55.031 --> 09:56.965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:57.065 --> 09:59.531
Yeah, normally, I would love to see the Preds

09:59.631 --> 10:02.165
get their little scheme tossed right back at 'em,

10:02.265 --> 10:04.933
but you're forgetting just one little thing.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.100
Oh?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.166
And that would be?

10:09.266 --> 10:12.167
Optimus would get blown to scrap.

10:12.267 --> 10:14.234
Big problem.

10:14.334 --> 10:18.368
Well, that depends on your viewpoint.

10:18.469 --> 10:20.402
Hey, hey, hey, shut up.

10:20.502 --> 10:23.169
Actually, ahem,

10:23.269 --> 10:25.336
that's not a bad idea.

10:25.436 --> 10:27.603
Cheetor, what have you done?

10:27.703 --> 10:29.337
It's gonna be okay.

10:29.437 --> 10:31.604
Optimus has got it under his thumb.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.437
Tell 'em, big bot.

10:33.537 --> 10:34.671
( groans )

10:34.771 --> 10:37.338
I-- I think I can do this.

10:37.438 --> 10:40.072
By channeling this new fighting instinct,

10:40.172 --> 10:42.072
we can storm their base.

10:42.172 --> 10:45.006
And with your help,

10:45.106 --> 10:47.440
obtain the anti-virus.

10:47.539 --> 10:49.540
Yeah, piece of basic programming.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.841
We blast our way into Scorponok's lab

10:51.941 --> 10:53.274
for the anti-virus.

10:53.374 --> 10:56.241
All we want is to get big bot here back to normal.

10:56.341 --> 11:01.175
Yeah, and what if he goes ape slag on us?

11:01.275 --> 11:03.976
Hm, fine by me.

11:04.076 --> 11:08.210
Hey, they made me what I am today,

11:08.310 --> 11:12.211
so I figure it's time to say thank you.

11:12.311 --> 11:13.411
Now.

11:13.511 --> 11:16.711
Yeah!

11:16.811 --> 11:18.111
( gasps )

11:18.212 --> 11:19.945
( alarm blaring )

11:20.045 --> 11:22.046
( dramatic rock theme playing )

11:22.146 --> 11:23.779
( yells )

11:23.879 --> 11:27.646
Stupid slagging circuit systems!

11:27.746 --> 11:29.080
Shut up!

11:29.180 --> 11:30.646
( gasps )

11:47.083 --> 11:48.383
( yells )

11:48.484 --> 11:50.884
Well, stop him before he hurts himself.

11:50.984 --> 11:54.084
Him? Try us.

11:54.184 --> 11:56.184
( grunts )

12:01.285 --> 12:04.086
Keep his arm down.

12:04.186 --> 12:05.686
Watch that laser.

12:05.786 --> 12:07.787
( grunting )

12:09.220 --> 12:10.954
( grunts )

12:11.054 --> 12:13.187
( Optimus yells )

12:13.287 --> 12:16.055
( panting )

12:16.155 --> 12:18.222
You don't understand.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.021
It's like Dinobot says,

12:20.121 --> 12:23.223
we gotta hit the Preds the only way they understand.

12:23.323 --> 12:27.990
Hard, fast and right where it hurts.

12:28.090 --> 12:31.624
But if your caution circuits are overriding your courage,

12:31.724 --> 12:33.023
let's melt you all.

12:33.123 --> 12:34.958
I don't need you.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.958
I'll handle this myself.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.792
( gasps )

12:43.092 --> 12:44.559
Optimus!

12:44.659 --> 12:46.659
( dramatic theme playing )

12:48.659 --> 12:52.260
Big bot. No.

12:52.360 --> 12:56.428
This is not the way, Cheetor.

12:56.528 --> 12:58.261
We gotta back him up.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.462
It is a doomed mission.

13:00.561 --> 13:04.762
There's no strategy, just blind aggression.

13:04.863 --> 13:06.363
Maybe that's what we've been needing.

13:06.463 --> 13:09.163
A little less brain and a little more guts.

13:09.263 --> 13:12.663
We must try to think what Optimus,

13:12.763 --> 13:17.065
the old Optimus, would do.

13:17.165 --> 13:19.131
And that would be...?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.098
Hm...

13:21.198 --> 13:24.266
Negotiate.

13:24.366 --> 13:28.067
Got a Maximal tight beam transmission coming in.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.833
It's a little garbled by the energon fields, but--

13:30.933 --> 13:32.767
Bring it up. Yes.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.034
CHEETOR: Predacon base, come in.

13:36.134 --> 13:39.301
Hm, pussycat. Yes.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.335
State your business.

13:41.435 --> 13:44.202
Listen up you mis-wired metal heads.

13:44.302 --> 13:47.803
You botched up your little attitude adjustment on Optimus.

13:47.903 --> 13:50.770
He's flaming towards you on the red eye express,

13:50.871 --> 13:53.370
and he's loaded for mainframe combat.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.271
So what do you say you fork over that anti-virus

13:56.371 --> 13:57.972
before you get vaped?

13:58.072 --> 14:02.205
Any renegade Maximal who blunders into our base

14:02.305 --> 14:04.372
will not survive.

14:04.472 --> 14:05.973
Megatron out.

14:06.073 --> 14:07.839
Incompetent bug.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.773
( gasps )

14:11.373 --> 14:12.740
Beast mode.

14:17.674 --> 14:19.975
Eh. Well?

14:20.075 --> 14:21.375
It didn't work.

14:21.475 --> 14:22.809
All we did was tip 'em off,

14:22.909 --> 14:24.842
and now they're gonna be waiting for him.

14:24.942 --> 14:27.910
You and your bright ideas.

14:28.010 --> 14:30.910
It would appear that only Optimus

14:31.010 --> 14:33.344
can truly think like Optimus.

14:33.444 --> 14:35.078
And for the rest of us,

14:35.178 --> 14:40.045
we must now think on our own.

14:40.144 --> 14:42.512
( dramatic theme playing )

14:50.580 --> 14:52.247
Report.

14:52.347 --> 14:53.881
Three direct hits.

14:53.981 --> 14:56.014
Outer hull has been breached.

14:56.114 --> 14:59.215
Tarantulas, destroy the intruder.

( growls )

15:42.022 --> 15:44.289
( groans )

15:48.357 --> 15:49.590
He's inside.

15:49.689 --> 15:51.790
And the other Maximals are coming.

15:51.891 --> 15:54.324
Take Terrorsaur and defend the perimeter.

15:54.423 --> 15:57.658
Waspinator, stop Optimus now.

15:57.758 --> 16:01.992
Ooh, Waspinator get him.

16:05.759 --> 16:07.493
( distant scream )

16:07.593 --> 16:09.426

( Waspinator grunts )

16:35.164 --> 16:37.331
( dramatic rock theme playing )

16:54.034 --> 16:57.034
CHEETOR: Is there any of the old Optimus left?

16:57.134 --> 16:58.902
Don't let it go, big bot.

16:59.002 --> 17:02.035
Don't let this thing tweak you out of control.

17:02.135 --> 17:05.369
Cheetor. Cheetor.

17:05.469 --> 17:07.236
Cheetor, now.

17:10.703 --> 17:12.904
Beast mode.

17:29.373 --> 17:30.606
Ah.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.175
( Optimus grunting )

17:45.342 --> 17:48.609
Looking for this, perhaps?

17:48.709 --> 17:49.843
( groans )

17:49.943 --> 17:51.910
Gorilla warfare suits you.

17:52.010 --> 17:55.278
The old Optimus would've never made it this far.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.745
Unh. What is it you want?

17:58.845 --> 18:03.412
Your allegiance in exchange for this anti-virus. Yes.

18:03.512 --> 18:06.246
And if I refuse?

18:06.345 --> 18:09.013
You cannot refuse. No.

18:09.113 --> 18:11.313
Not if you want to survive.

18:11.413 --> 18:13.880
Join me or perish.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.980
( groaning )

18:18.347 --> 18:24.216
Oh, yes. Then why not end this here and now, Megatron?

18:24.315 --> 18:29.283
Ugh, you fool! You'll destroy us all.

18:29.383 --> 18:34.684
Just a little trick I learned from a flower, Megatron.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.784
( yells )

18:40.919 --> 18:44.019
Scorponok!

OPTIMUS: Spark fading.

18:52.220 --> 18:56.021
Hang on, big bot. Got the anti-virus right here.

18:57.655 --> 18:59.454
( groans )

19:02.888 --> 19:05.055
Yes. We're online.

19:05.155 --> 19:07.622
Let's bail before that thing blows.

19:07.722 --> 19:09.190
( panting )

19:10.623 --> 19:13.224
Get this thing off of me. Now.

( dramatic rock theme playing )

19:15.491 --> 19:17.691
Time to fade, heroes.

Bedside vigil, Dinobot?

19:47.930 --> 19:49.829
Not like you.

19:49.930 --> 19:53.597
It was my shift.

19:55.264 --> 19:57.798
Well, ahem,

19:57.897 --> 20:02.865
it's good to have you back.

20:04.532 --> 20:08.166
Back home? Or back to normal?

20:11.533 --> 20:13.433
Both.
