00:08.472 --> 00:11.623
(Niles)
Calm down, dear. Listen.

00:11.936 --> 00:16.930
Take a left, then the second right,
then a left again.

00:17.319 --> 00:20.595
- OK. Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Is Maris lost again?

00:20.909 --> 00:23.104
She wandered
into the kitchen by mistake.

00:23.371 --> 00:26.363
I had to talk her back to the living room.

00:28.839 --> 00:31.034
Any chance of getting a table?

00:31.301 --> 00:34.611
No. They got their check
five minutes ago,

00:34.932 --> 00:36.888
but they've been
sitting there ever since.

00:37.144 --> 00:40.819
- I shoot them dirty looks, all in vain.
- Show me the look.

00:43.363 --> 00:46.116
They're there for a while.

00:46.409 --> 00:48.400
- Shall we order?
- Why not?

00:48.663 --> 00:51.416
- What are your coffees today?
- Zimbabwe and Kenya.

00:51.710 --> 00:55.862
- Ooh, I'll have a Zimbabwe latte.
- I'll have a Kenya cappuccino.

00:56.218 --> 00:58.049
So what's new?

00:58.304 --> 01:01.262
The gardener finally won
the battle of the wills.

01:01.559 --> 01:06.314
He got Maris to dig up her camellias
so he could put in that Zen garden.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.728
- How did it turn out?
- It's beautiful.

01:08.988 --> 01:10.944
The perfect place for meditation.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.113
Yesterday I found Maris
sitting in the lotus position.

01:15.457 --> 01:18.449
Good for her.
It's bringing out her spiritual side.

01:18.754 --> 01:21.188
She was reading Danielle Steele

01:21.467 --> 01:25.460
and making a nail appointment
on her phone.

01:25.808 --> 01:28.925
Do you realise that it's a year
since I moved from Boston?

01:29.230 --> 01:33.746
Really? A year? It seems like yesterday
Dad moved in with you.

01:34.113 --> 01:37.822
People can have opposite impressions
of the same event.

01:38.162 --> 01:41.871
Look at them. Sitting there
like they own that table.

01:42.209 --> 01:45.406
- Let's both give them the look.
- It's worth a try.

01:48.011 --> 01:51.083
- It worked!
- Niles, I'll never doubt you again!

01:58.612 --> 02:02.002
Try the look on that table.
I'm going to the men's room.

02:05.247 --> 02:07.203
- Maddening!
- What?

02:07.460 --> 02:12.295
The moisturiser dispenser in the gents.
The cream is too oily, so I re-washed.

02:12.676 --> 02:15.474
And then the hand dryer breaks down.

02:15.765 --> 02:18.677
How do you get through the day?

02:18.978 --> 02:22.175
- Here you go, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
- Thank you.

02:22.485 --> 02:24.680
- Did I say decaf?
- No.

02:24.947 --> 02:27.302
Oh, I'm sorry. If I drink the regular stuff,

02:27.576 --> 02:31.091
it'll keep me tossing and turning
through my brother's conversation.

02:31.415 --> 02:33.690
(Waitress) 'No problem.'
(Frasier) 'Thank you.'

02:33.962 --> 02:36.601
Nobody's leaving.
Let's take a table outside.

02:36.883 --> 02:39.317
Why not? I'm feeling al fresco.

02:39.596 --> 02:43.032
Oh, how does Mrs Fresco
feel about that?

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.247 --> 02:57.397
Must be a riot on camping trips.

02:59.170 --> 03:02.082
- Would you like a...?
- No.

03:03.927 --> 03:08.364
Now that chapter two of your life is in
full swing, can I ask you something?

03:08.728 --> 03:11.401
- Sure.
- Are you happy?

03:13.986 --> 03:16.898
- Did you hear the question?
- Yes, I'm thinking.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.873
- It's a complex question.
- No, it's not.

03:20.163 --> 03:22.358
- It is.
- Either you're happy or not.

03:22.626 --> 03:26.460
- Are you?
- No, but we're not talking about me.

03:26.798 --> 03:32.111
Let's not gloss over that. You have
just told me you're not happy. Why?

03:33.477 --> 03:37.152
I was watching PBS the other night -
a documentary

03:37.483 --> 03:39.792
on the Great Depression.
Vintage Steinbeck.

03:40.071 --> 03:42.539
Poor people escaping the Dust Bowl,

03:42.826 --> 03:49.095
their meagre possessions on rickety,
old trucks heading to their "salvation".

03:49.545 --> 03:53.936
You see this scruffy little boy
being handed a new pair of shoes.

03:54.302 --> 03:58.693
Frasier, if you could have seen
the look on that boy's face.

03:59.060 --> 04:02.814
It was a look
of pure and utter happiness.

04:03.985 --> 04:07.694
I have never experienced
that kind of happiness in my life.

04:08.033 --> 04:11.912
Not even when I bought
these $400 Bruno Maglis.

04:13.459 --> 04:15.415
- Do you like them?
- Very nice.

04:15.671 --> 04:18.469
- What about the tassels?
- I'm not a tassel guy.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.319
Neither am I.
Nevertheless, there they are.

04:24.811 --> 04:28.645
I have no reason to be unhappy.
I have my health.

04:28.985 --> 04:31.180
I have a wonderful home,
a beautiful wife.

04:31.447 --> 04:34.166
- Did your eyebrow just move?
- No.

04:35.454 --> 04:37.410
I have my practice.

04:37.665 --> 04:40.543
But I've lost the ideals that led me
to psychiatry in the first place.

04:40.837 --> 04:45.308
Who am I talking to? Psychiatry's
answer to the drive-through window.

04:48.016 --> 04:51.929
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm not just in it for the money.

04:52.273 --> 04:55.982
Oh, I wouldn't say that's true.
If it were... Oh.

04:56.321 --> 04:58.915
- What were you going to say?
- I'd rather not.

04:59.201 --> 05:03.194
There's no need to. I know what
you've wanted to ask me for years:

05:04.377 --> 05:06.891
did I marry Maris for the money?

05:08.299 --> 05:11.848
I resent that!
I did not marry Maris for the money.

05:12.181 --> 05:16.413
- It was just a delightful bonus.
- So you really do love her?

05:16.772 --> 05:20.242
Of course I love her!
But it's a different kind of love.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.720
You mean, it's not human?

05:25.369 --> 05:29.806
No. I mean, it doesn't burn
with the passion of a Tristan and Isolde.

05:30.168 --> 05:34.286
It's more comfortable, more familiar.
Maris and I are old friends.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.750
We can spend an afternoon together,

05:37.014 --> 05:41.565
me at my jigsaw puzzle,
she at her Autoharp,

05:41.938 --> 05:45.613
not a word spoken between us,
and be perfectly content.

05:46.905 --> 05:51.695
I'm told it was a lot like that
near the end in the Hitler household.

05:53.165 --> 05:55.759
Let's shift the subject
back to where it belongs.

05:56.045 --> 05:59.355
I asked you whether you were happy.
Just answer.

05:59.676 --> 06:02.554
- Well...
- (Roz) Hey, guys.

06:02.848 --> 06:05.237
- Hi, Roz.
- What are you doing here?

06:05.518 --> 06:07.588
I always wanted to fly a jet,

06:07.856 --> 06:11.929
and today they're offering
a special on jet-flying lessons.

06:13.824 --> 06:16.975
I came here to get coffee.

06:17.288 --> 06:20.644
Thanks for stopping by.
I'd have been mad if you didn't.

06:20.961 --> 06:23.031
I'm also meeting someone here.

06:23.298 --> 06:25.050
Oh, let me guess. A man?

06:25.301 --> 06:27.053
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:27.305 --> 06:31.856
The new guy from the news department
caught me checking him out.

06:32.230 --> 06:36.348
- He was bent over the water fountain.
- Love at first sight.

06:36.696 --> 06:40.006
He said, "Let's get some coffee
and get acquainted."

06:40.326 --> 06:44.365
I've got a strange feeling
that this guy might be the one.

06:44.709 --> 06:50.466
You say that about every guy you meet.
Let's just see if this one calls back.

06:52.096 --> 06:55.452
Yeah, I guess.
You know, I don't think he's here yet.

06:55.768 --> 06:58.521
- I'll go snag a table.
- Good luck.

06:58.815 --> 07:02.285
- Bye, Roz.
- Yeah.

07:02.614 --> 07:06.209
- I don't think she likes me.
- It isn't a question of liking or not liking.

07:06.536 --> 07:10.370
- She despises you.
- Really?

07:10.710 --> 07:14.180
I warrant such strong emotions?
I barely acknowledge her existence.

07:14.507 --> 07:17.067
You may be
on to something there, Sherlock.

07:23.773 --> 07:27.288
She is comely
in a back-alley sort of way.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.569
She's very attractive.

07:29.824 --> 07:33.339
- Did you ever think about you two...?
- Roz and me? Oh, no.

07:33.665 --> 07:35.895
Oh, come on! Never fantasised

07:36.168 --> 07:38.557
about stealing away
to a motel with her?

07:38.839 --> 07:43.276
I'm a man with normal urges,
and she has a silk blouse

07:43.639 --> 07:46.711
that opens a bit when she leans over
the cart rack, but...

07:47.019 --> 07:50.694
Oh, mixing work with romance...
Is it ever worth it?

07:51.026 --> 07:55.099
Don't ask me. You're the one
that looked down her blouse.

07:55.450 --> 07:58.681
- Decaf Zimbabwe latte.
- Is that non-fat milk?

07:58.998 --> 08:00.989
- No.
- I hate to be a bother.

08:01.252 --> 08:03.846
It's just that I'm watching my fat intake.

08:05.341 --> 08:07.093
Is that rain?

08:07.345 --> 08:10.940
- No, God is crying.
- Can't I ask a simple question?

08:11.268 --> 08:13.657
Do you ask any other kind?

08:15.442 --> 08:18.559
Hey, how the hell did she get a table?

08:19.907 --> 08:22.023
Oh, Frasier, Frasier! There!

08:23.371 --> 08:25.327
(Frasier)
Oh!

08:25.583 --> 08:28.051
- Frasier!
- Oh, Niles, Niles!

08:28.338 --> 08:30.488
Oh, good block!

08:30.759 --> 08:32.953
Sorry!

08:33.220 --> 08:35.176
Good work there.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.788
I just wanted it a little more than he did.

08:40.732 --> 08:42.962
Oh, boy, it's really coming down.

08:47.745 --> 08:49.497
What?

08:49.748 --> 08:51.864
Something happened
the other morning.

08:52.169 --> 08:56.003
I asked Dad to pass me a bran muffin.
You know what he said?

08:56.342 --> 08:59.857
- He said, "What's the magic word?"
- You're kidding!

09:00.182 --> 09:03.379
He didn't find it amusing
when I said "rest home".

09:10.616 --> 09:15.895
Oh, oh, oh! Look, look!
That must be Roz's coffee companion.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.805
Wow, he's really handsome, isn't he?

09:19.088 --> 09:21.397
"Wow"? Did you say "wow"?

09:21.676 --> 09:23.632
Good Lord, I did.

09:23.887 --> 09:27.436
I don't think I've ever said "wow"
describing another man before.

09:27.769 --> 09:29.760
Does that mean something?

09:30.022 --> 09:32.138
It means you're a gay man.

09:33.821 --> 09:37.018
Your life with Maris is a charade.
Come out of the closet.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.716
You want to tell Dad or shall l?

09:42.501 --> 09:46.574
This was stupid!
This whole idea was stupid! Admit it.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.200
No! You needed exercise.

09:49.472 --> 09:52.509
It was stupid to come out
without your bumbershoot.

09:52.810 --> 09:55.119
It's an umbrella! Speak English!

09:55.398 --> 09:57.354
Sorry, no dogs allowed.

09:57.610 --> 10:00.522
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.789
It's OK.

10:06.041 --> 10:09.750
- Oh, Niles?
- Hello, Dad.

10:10.089 --> 10:14.287
- What are you two doing here?
- I felt we needed some exercise.

10:14.638 --> 10:18.108
I had to pick up some beans anyway,
so we walked.

10:18.436 --> 10:20.870
Well, one of us
was dragged by his collar.

10:21.148 --> 10:25.426
I told you I didn't want to come.
Look at me, I'll die of pneumonia.

10:25.781 --> 10:28.500
You'll outlive us.
The cranky ones always do.

10:28.786 --> 10:33.143
Let's get you something hot to drink.
You want a cappuccino or...?

10:33.503 --> 10:37.018
- Can I help you?
- Coffee, black, nothing fancy in it.

10:37.342 --> 10:39.697
We have two special coffees today...

10:39.972 --> 10:42.202
I'll surprise you.

10:44.729 --> 10:48.358
Oh, joy. There's nothing like
the smell of a wet dog

10:48.694 --> 10:50.650
to work up the appetite for supper.

10:52.033 --> 10:55.867
- We're soaked to the skin!
- You're in a fine mood today!

10:56.206 --> 10:58.879
- You left a mess in the kitchen.
- I had toast!

10:59.170 --> 11:02.003
Yeah, and you buttered it
on the counter.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.690
I know because you left
crumbs and toast sweat there!

11:06.015 --> 11:08.654
- Toast sweat?
- Yes, yes.

11:08.936 --> 11:13.214
When you put hot toast on any surface,
it leaves drops of dew.

11:13.569 --> 11:16.527
Haven't you heard Dad's lecture
on the evils of toast sweat?

11:16.824 --> 11:19.657
It's the scourge of our times!

11:21.373 --> 11:23.125
One coffee, black.

11:25.213 --> 11:28.808
And a decaf, non-fat Zimbabwe latte.

11:29.136 --> 11:31.570
Oh, dear,
is that cinnamon on that foam?

11:34.895 --> 11:38.012
As long as we're picking
each other's scabs here,

11:38.318 --> 11:41.196
I found Eddie's chew toy
in my sweater cubby.

11:41.490 --> 11:44.766
Hair all over my favourite pullover!
He sleeps in there!

11:45.079 --> 11:47.752
Because you keep sweaters
in a "cubby".

11:48.042 --> 11:51.830
Oh! Well, my bedroom
is off-limits to this flea bag.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.768
- He's not a flea bag!
- How about those Mariners?

11:55.053 --> 11:57.362
Shut up, Niles!

11:57.641 --> 12:00.599
If my hip's good enough to get me here,

12:00.896 --> 12:03.854
maybe it's time
I found a place of my own!

12:04.152 --> 12:07.110
- Where will you go?
- Don't worry. I'll find a place.

12:07.408 --> 12:10.878
I've got a little money saved up.
I never wanted to move in with you.

12:11.205 --> 12:14.675
(Dad and Frasier) "l don't want
to be a burden to anybody!"

12:15.003 --> 12:18.200
That's Frasier's smartass way
of telling me he's heard this.

12:18.509 --> 12:22.627
You won't have to hear it again.
Tell Daphne to catch up with us.

12:22.975 --> 12:27.253
We go through this melodrama
every week! Sit down!

12:27.608 --> 12:30.600
- No. How much for the coffee?
- $1.50.

12:30.905 --> 12:34.341
For coffee?
What kind of world are we living in?

12:42.089 --> 12:44.080
You were in that bathroom forever.

12:44.344 --> 12:48.895
I tried that damn hand cream.
I'm so oily, I couldn't grip the doorknob.

12:50.019 --> 12:54.615
When some guy came in,
I said, "Am I glad to see you!"

12:55.862 --> 12:59.252
I can't even begin to describe
the look he gave me.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.123
There it is.

13:09.093 --> 13:12.005
So, I'm told you and your dad
are at it again.

13:12.306 --> 13:14.262
What's new?

13:14.518 --> 13:18.511
Lately, he's had a face
as long as a wet weekend.

13:18.859 --> 13:21.817
Yesterday, when I insisted
he do his stretching exercises,

13:22.114 --> 13:25.265
he told me to stick me feet
behind me head and spin like a top.

13:25.578 --> 13:28.809
The best thing to do
is to ignore him when he's like that.

13:29.126 --> 13:32.243
Isn't that right, Niles? Niles?

13:36.137 --> 13:39.493
I'm sorry. For some reason,
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.695
- I'll go after him.
- Oh, here.

13:45.903 --> 13:48.736
- Take my bumbershoot.
- That's nice.

13:49.034 --> 13:51.502
At least someone
appreciates my mother tongue.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.743
I've always had an ear for your tongue.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.752
Oh, Niles!

13:58.131 --> 14:00.122
What did I say?

14:01.471 --> 14:06.147
- Want another coffee?
- Not until I've had my first one, thanks.

14:10.736 --> 14:13.967
Why is it always so difficult
between me and Dad?

14:14.283 --> 14:16.433
Look at it from Dad's point of view.

14:16.703 --> 14:20.059
As a policeman, he had authority.
That's been taken away.

14:20.377 --> 14:25.053
Criticising the world, he controls
his shrinking sphere of influence.

14:25.426 --> 14:28.384
I do empathise with him. It's just...

14:28.682 --> 14:32.994
I can't help wishing to kick that cane
out from under him sometimes

14:33.356 --> 14:35.916
and that he would land on Eddie.

14:37.989 --> 14:41.698
- It's hard. I know you're trying.
- I am.

14:42.037 --> 14:44.471
Sometimes,
I see the fruits of my labour.

14:44.750 --> 14:48.823
The other night, Dad was watching TV.
I'd fallen asleep on the couch.

14:49.174 --> 14:52.166
Suddenly I stirred.
I felt something on my head.

14:52.471 --> 14:54.860
Dad was standing there,
stroking my hair.

14:55.142 --> 14:56.894
Dad?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.732
Did he say anything?

14:59.984 --> 15:04.102
Yeah, he said, "Don't you think it's time
for a haircut? You look like Bozo."

15:05.994 --> 15:08.713
I know he was covering.
What do you think?

15:08.998 --> 15:12.513
- Wouldn't hurt to get a trim.
- No...

15:12.838 --> 15:16.547
- Do you think he was covering?
- Of course. You know Dad.

15:16.887 --> 15:21.199
Tough as nails on the outside,
but on the inside, one giant spike.

15:23.564 --> 15:26.124
- Grazie.
- Excuse me. What about mine?

15:26.402 --> 15:29.280
We have a team of specialists
working on it.

15:34.624 --> 15:38.663
Let's change the subject from Dad
and talk about something else.

15:39.006 --> 15:43.477
- Yes, about something light and frothy.
- I agree.

15:43.847 --> 15:45.963
Are you in love with Daphne?

15:49.315 --> 15:52.591
That's a little frothier than I had in mind.

15:54.323 --> 15:59.033
That is preposterous! I refuse
to dignify that question with an answer.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.532
I don't know.
There, I said it! Are you happy?

16:07.846 --> 16:11.361
Why did you have to hire
Venus herself?

16:11.685 --> 16:16.679
Why not a beefy, Eastern-European
scrubwoman who reeked of ammonia?

16:18.905 --> 16:22.580
I asked, but it was an Olympic year.
The agency was fresh out.

16:28.796 --> 16:31.833
Frasier, I can't get her out of my mind.

16:32.135 --> 16:36.572
Daphne stirs a passion in me
I've never known before.

16:36.935 --> 16:41.053
- You're not considering leaving Maris?
- No.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.834
I suppose the situation you're in is

16:44.113 --> 16:48.106
that you'd like to stay with Maris
but have an affair with Daphne.

16:48.454 --> 16:51.287
- Yes. Can I do that?
- No, you can't.

16:55.341 --> 17:00.096
I thought that I couldn't, but you
got my hopes up there for a minute.

17:00.474 --> 17:04.022
Oh, it's easy for you.
You're free, you're happy.

17:04.355 --> 17:06.868
You haven't answered
that question yet.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.984
- I haven't?
- No, you haven't. Are you happy?

17:11.325 --> 17:15.637
Well, I guess the best way
I could think of saying it is...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.515
- This sucks.
- What's the matter?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.955
You're having coffee
with a man and think he might

17:23.303 --> 17:28.252
lead you to something like,
oh, I don't know, a life?

17:28.645 --> 17:33.844
Suddenly, the trapdoor opens
and you're right back in Roz's world.

17:34.238 --> 17:36.752
- How did it go so wrong so quickly?
- Simple.

17:37.035 --> 17:39.151
He just wanted to convert me.

17:39.413 --> 17:44.931
I have nothing against religious people.
I'm ecumenical.

17:45.339 --> 17:47.807
I embrace men of all faiths.

17:49.972 --> 17:52.691
If only it stopped there.

17:55.815 --> 17:59.569
He pretended it was a date. Isn't there
a commandment against that?

17:59.905 --> 18:03.978
No, they didn't go into dating
until the New Testament.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.923
Roz, I'm sorry. Why don't you join us?

18:07.209 --> 18:11.885
No, thank you. There's a cute
new handyman in my building.

18:12.259 --> 18:16.810
I'll just go home, slip into a negligee
and rip out my faucet.

18:18.728 --> 18:21.640
You think she's kidding, don't you?

18:23.361 --> 18:27.240
I think about Roz's life,
and it makes me wonder about my own.

18:29.871 --> 18:32.669
I haven't been exactly
burning up the social scene lately.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.032
- You'll find somebody.
- But what if I don't?

18:36.340 --> 18:39.457
What if I end up old and alone?

18:39.762 --> 18:44.756
I might have to buy a funny little dog
and move in with Frederick.

18:45.147 --> 18:47.581
I don't have to worry
about that for a while.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.579
No. Frederick should worry about that.

18:53.118 --> 18:57.396
You might try answering
my original question: are you happy?

18:57.751 --> 18:59.946
I guess I'd have to say...

19:00.213 --> 19:02.602
- Hello, boys.
- Oh, for Pete's sake.

19:02.884 --> 19:06.923
- Dad, what are you doing back here?
- I don't know, I...

19:07.266 --> 19:12.818
I've been acting like a jerk lately,
and taking it out on you and Daphne.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.794
All that stuff I said earlier,
forget about it.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.701
- I already have.
- Come on, Eddie.

19:20.038 --> 19:25.032
Dad, listen, has something been
bothering you the last few days?

19:25.421 --> 19:27.616
- No, no.
- Come on.

19:27.884 --> 19:29.920
- Nothing.
- Is something bothering you?

19:30.179 --> 19:32.613
- Just tell us.
- Just say it.

19:33.852 --> 19:35.808
OK.

19:36.064 --> 19:38.862
Last Sunday was my birthday.

19:42.366 --> 19:46.917
Of course it was. Frasier and l
planned a big surprise party,

19:47.290 --> 19:50.088
but on your birthday
it wouldn't have been a surprise.

19:50.379 --> 19:53.610
Thus we waited a week.
So, surprise!

19:56.722 --> 19:59.077
Oh, if you could see
the look on your face.

20:00.312 --> 20:04.225
Just give it up, Niles.
Dad, I'm sorry.

20:04.569 --> 20:06.924
- Oh, no.
- Come and have a seat.

20:07.198 --> 20:10.156
You know, I don't know
why I let it bother me.

20:10.454 --> 20:15.130
All those years on the force,
I missed enough of your birthdays.

20:15.504 --> 20:21.500
You know what? We can still celebrate.
We'll take you out to dinner tonight.

20:21.931 --> 20:25.162
- You don't need to do that.
- Absolutely. You name the place.

20:25.479 --> 20:27.231
OK.

20:27.482 --> 20:32.237
- How about Hoppy's Old Heidelberg?
- Oh, great! Great!

20:32.616 --> 20:35.255
They were voted
best bratwurst in town.

20:35.537 --> 20:37.493
Ach du lieber!

20:39.335 --> 20:42.054
I've been on Third Street
looking for you.

20:42.340 --> 20:46.379
I was on Fourth Street.
Eddie had smelled everything on Third.

20:46.722 --> 20:50.795
- How did you know I was here?
- One of me psychic flashes.

20:51.146 --> 20:54.536
Bang! There you were walking
into Café Nervosa.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.057
You were apologising for the way
you've treated me this week.

20:58.366 --> 21:01.438
I'm sorry about that.
Just forget about it, all right?

21:01.747 --> 21:05.535
And something about a raise...

21:07.047 --> 21:09.925
- You're winging it now.
- Am I that transparent?

21:10.219 --> 21:12.574
No, I'm psychic.

21:12.849 --> 21:17.604
The boys are taking us out
to Hoppy's Old Heidelberg for dinner.

21:17.982 --> 21:20.371
Oh, great. German food!

21:20.653 --> 21:25.773
We whip the Jerries twice this century,
and they still have the last laugh.

21:26.162 --> 21:27.914
Dad, sorry, I can't give you a ride.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.309
- I'll give him a lift.
- Ah.

21:32.423 --> 21:35.859
I've enjoyed
getting together with you for coffee.

21:36.179 --> 21:40.377
- What do you talk about all the time?
- Sports, chicks, monster truck rallies.

21:40.728 --> 21:43.083
OK, don't tell me.

21:45.736 --> 21:51.094
Zimbabwe, decaf, non-fat milk,
no cinnamon in sight. Now...

21:51.495 --> 21:53.213
Are you happy?

21:55.794 --> 22:00.584
You know, in the greater
scheme of things, yes, I'd say I am.

22:12.906 --> 22:16.979
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:18.582 --> 22:19.810
# Quite stylish

22:20.042 --> 22:25.719
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.221 --> 22:30.896
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.106 --> 22:35.415
# They're calling again #

22:35.694 --> 22:38.413
See you next year! We love you!
