About a week ago.
I've been doing it
for about a week.

Why would you do that?
Well, because, you know,
electricity's so expensive, man.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.114
So I figured let's
get a generator and,
you know, run the bar on it.

that basic dynamic, right?

Yes. Right?

00:58.692 --> 01:02.928
Our problem
is that we don't stick
to that basic format,

and it gets us into trouble.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.465
So what you're saying
is that by breaking
from that format,

01:06.467 --> 01:08.834
we're actually limiting
our ability to be
as successful...

01:08.836 --> 01:11.703

ass-plowing hearts.

01:19.413 --> 01:23.615

It involves pulling up our
bootstraps,

01:25.686 --> 01:30.189

Yes.
We go to a bank.

02:16.570 --> 02:21.173

We get a hefty loan to buy
a bunch of gasoline.

skyrocket, we sell it,

You gotta have customers to
have a working business, right?

I for one suggest me blowing
fireballs to get that attention.

coming from? No.
