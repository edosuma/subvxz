WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:04.772
Hanna: DOLLS?

00:07.275 --> 00:09.277
THIS IS THE POLICE!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

00:09.310 --> 00:10.744
THEY SET US UP!

00:10.778 --> 00:13.481
Jenna: I WISH I COULD SEE
 THOSE BITCHES RIGHT NOW.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.449
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO LINK US TO THAT NIGHT.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.685
WHAT I WANT IS FOR
YOU TO FORGET ABOUT ME.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.420
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY,

00:19.453 --> 00:20.688
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR SISTER

00:20.721 --> 00:22.156
AND THAT COP
BOYFRIEND OF HERS.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.491
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.427
THIS WAS GOING ON
WHILE YOU WERE
HER TEACHER?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.528
YOU ARE GONNA LEAVE
THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.363
DAD!

00:29.397 --> 00:30.564
WE'RE MOVING BACK
TO ROSEWOOD--

00:30.598 --> 00:32.700
ME, ISABEL, KATE.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.335
I WANT THE BOX
THAT JASON GAVE ARIA.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.170
WELL, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET IT.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.738
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MAKING
ANY KIND OF A DEAL WITH "A."

00:37.771 --> 00:39.840
"A" TOOK THE BAIT.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.342
"WANT TO MAKE A DEAL?"

00:41.375 --> 00:42.676
YOU'RE AFRAID
WE FOUND SOMETHING,

00:42.710 --> 00:44.412
SOMETHING IN THIS BOX.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.515
( grunts and groans )

00:47.548 --> 00:49.283
NO! EMILY!

00:49.317 --> 00:51.085
( glass shatters )

00:56.124 --> 00:57.358
THAT'S "A's" CELLPHONE!

01:00.594 --> 01:03.464
HOW HARD DID YOU HIT
HIM-- HER-- IT?

01:03.497 --> 01:04.831
DIDN'T RUN LIKE A HER.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.400
I THOUGHT
IT WAS AN ANIMAL.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.202
IT WAS. IS.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.270
OKAY, WHERE IS THE BOX?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.372
YOU GUYS,
THIS PHONE IS LOCKED.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.873
AND WHERE WERE YOU GUYS?
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET UP HERE.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.742
WASN'T THAT THE PLAN?
I'M SO SORRY, EM.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.777
I-I DROPPED
A HUGE BOMB AT HOME.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.346
MY PARENTS WON'T
LET ME GO ANYWHERE.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.547
I HAD TO CRAWL
THROUGH MIKE'S WINDOW.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.349
AND TOBY CAME IN
AND TOTALLY CORNERED ME

01:21.382 --> 01:23.384
WITH ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHY I WAS ACTING THIS WAY,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.219
AND HE WOULD NOT LEAVE
WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.121
KATE'S MOVING TO ROSEWOOD.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.456
All: WHAT?!

01:28.489 --> 01:29.857
YEAH.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.859
YEAH, MY DAD
AND ISABEL GOT MARRIED,

01:31.892 --> 01:35.529
AND NOW THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR A HOUSE
HERE IN ROSEWOOD.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.531
SO NOW I HAVE MORE THAN
ONE MONSTER IN MY LIFE.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.267
OKAY? I WIN.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.335
NO, YOU DON'T!
I WAS ALMOST KILLED!

01:41.369 --> 01:42.703
THESE ARE NOT
HIGHLIGHTS, HANNA.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.173
THIS IS GLASS IN MY HAIR!

01:45.206 --> 01:47.475
YOU GUYS, CAN YOU TALK
TO ME FOR A SECOND?

01:47.508 --> 01:50.211
I'M HOLDING "A's" PHONE
IN MY HAND. WHAT ARE WE
DOING WITH IT?

01:50.244 --> 01:52.413
SOMETHING, BEFORE "A"
KNOWS WE HAVE IT.
STAND STILL.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.648
HANNA, CALL CALEB!
WHY?

01:54.682 --> 01:56.350
HE'S THE BEST WAY THAT
WE CAN GET INFORMATION
OFF OF THIS.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.152
LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.187
BUT HE'S OUR BEST SHOT AT
TRACING THIS BACK TO "A."

01:59.220 --> 02:00.554
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.922
WE'LL TAKE IT TO
THE PHONE STORE TOMORROW.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.657
THE-- THE PHONE STORE?!

02:03.691 --> 02:05.259
WELL, THEN,
CALL TECHNICAL SUPPORT!

02:05.293 --> 02:07.228
WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE
IN PAKISTAN DO IT!

02:07.261 --> 02:08.596
HANNA!

02:08.628 --> 02:09.930
THIS CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.532
ONCE "A" REALIZES
IT'S MISSING--!

02:11.565 --> 02:12.900
I GET IT, OKAY?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.835
BUT THIS PHONE
IS CONNECTED TO JENNA

02:14.868 --> 02:16.670
AND OFFICER GARRETT.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.206
CALEB ALREADY HAS
BAD HISTORY WITH HER
AND THE POLICE.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.440
WE'RE NOT GOING THERE!

02:19.473 --> 02:21.175
OKAY, BUT IF HE
CAN FIND SOMETHING

02:21.209 --> 02:22.710
THAT FINALLY NAILS
THE TWO OF THEM
TOGETHER--

02:22.743 --> 02:24.345
AT LEAST CONSIDER IT.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.913
HANNA, COME ON,
THINK THIS THROUGH.
I AM.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.481
OKAY, YOU DONE THINKING?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.617
'CAUSE WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME HERE.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.519
WAIT, IS CALEB STILL
CRASHING WITH LUCAS?

02:31.552 --> 02:32.653
WHERE'S LUCAS' HOUSE?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.222
SPENCER,
STOP GIVING US ORDERS!

02:34.255 --> 02:35.823
WE'RE NOT
YOUR WINGED MONKEYS!

02:35.856 --> 02:37.758
GUYS, STOP!

02:37.791 --> 02:40.894
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A WAY THAT WE CAN GET
CALEB TO HELP WITHOUT--

02:40.928 --> 02:44.198
( telephone ringing )

02:44.232 --> 02:45.599
ANSWER IT.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.967
( ringing )

02:47.000 --> 02:48.469
ANSWER IT. ANSWER IT!

02:48.502 --> 02:49.937
WHY ME? I'VE GOT
GLASS IN MY HAIR!

02:49.970 --> 02:51.905
I'LL ANSWER IT!
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.474
SHOULD WE TELL THEM
THAT WE HAVE THE PHONE?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.509
THEY'LL KNOW THAT
WHEN YOU SAY HELLO.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.478
( ringing )

02:57.511 --> 02:59.347
IT'S BLOCKED.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.550
( glass shatters )

03:02.583 --> 03:04.285
I'VE GOT CALEB'S NUMBER!
I'M CALLING HIM!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.354
GO!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.863
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:15.896 --> 03:18.332
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:18.366 --> 03:20.701
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:20.734 --> 03:23.471
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:23.504 --> 03:26.240
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:26.274 --> 03:28.542
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:28.576 --> 03:33.381
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:37.785 --> 03:39.553
WHAT'S THAT NUMBER?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.789
TELLS ME HOW MUCH DATA IS
CURRENTLY LOADED ON THE PHONE.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.258
IT'S A LOT.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.394
YOU MEAN LIKE PHOTOS,
VIDEOS...?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.761
DEFINITELY MORE
THAN ANGRY BIRDS.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.797
AND HOW LONG WILL IT
TAKE TO DOWNLOAD?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.500
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.734
HANNA.
HM?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.035
YOU ALL RIGHT?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.304
YEAH.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.042
ALL RIGHT, CAN SOMEBODY
TELL ME WHOSE PHONE THIS IS?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.677
WE CAN'T. YET.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.514
THE LESS YOU KNOW
RIGHT NOW, THE BETTER.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.316
O-KAY.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.850
WELL, THEN, CAN SOMEBODY
AT LEAST TELL ME WHY

04:09.883 --> 04:11.419
EMILY SMELLS LIKE
A BAG OF MULCH?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.786
WAIT.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.355
SOMETHING JUST CAME UP.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.689
CRAP.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.024
PHONE GOT BRICKED.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.392
TRANSLATE, PLEASE.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.660
THE OWNER
SHUT DOWN THE PHONE

04:19.692 --> 04:21.362
FROM THEIR COMPUTER.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.564
SO WE LOST EVERYTHING?
WE NEVER HAD EVERYTHING.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.733
I HAVE SOME FILES,
BUT THEY'RE LOCKED

04:25.766 --> 04:27.635
AND THEY'RE
PROBABLY CORRUPTED.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.371
( disappointed sighs )

04:30.404 --> 04:32.406
I CAN TRY AND RETRIEVE
WHAT I HAVE,

04:32.440 --> 04:34.342
BUT IT'S
GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.743
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT ME TO WORK ON THIS?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.045
YES!
YES!
YES!

04:38.078 --> 04:42.049
HANNA, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT WITH THIS?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.396
'MORNING.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.898
UM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.467
SCHOOL.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.102
WEARING THAT?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.837
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.973
WELL, THAT'S NOT
APPROPRIATE FOR SCHOOL,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.509
SO... CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.446
( chuckles )
SINCE WHEN HAVE I
HAD A DRESS CODE, DAD?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.882
SINCE WE BECAME AWARE
OF WHO YOU MIGHT BE
DRESSING FOR,

05:14.915 --> 05:16.384
SO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.088
OKAY, WELL, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO WEAR,
A DOWN PARKA?

05:21.121 --> 05:24.324
BYRON, I'VE--
I'VE GOT THIS.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.961
( sighs )

05:33.534 --> 05:36.537
IF I WERE YOU, I'D PICK
AND CHOOSE MY BATTLES.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.872
SINCE WHEN DID WEARING
KNEE-HIGHS BECOME A BATTLE?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.874
TODAY IS NOT THE DAY
TO QUESTION YOUR FATHER.

05:40.908 --> 05:44.144
WHY? HE, OF ALL PEOPLE,
COMING DOWN ON ME

05:44.177 --> 05:45.746
FOR AN INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIP?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.347
ARIA!

05:48.449 --> 05:49.783
I'M SORRY.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.525
I JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE AT LEAST...

05:57.558 --> 05:59.693
YOU WOULD...
THAT I WOULD WHAT?

05:59.727 --> 06:01.128
THAT I WOULD GIVE
MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER

06:01.161 --> 06:04.131
AND MR. FITZ
MY BLESSING?

06:04.164 --> 06:07.601
YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE IN AGREEMENT HERE

06:07.635 --> 06:09.136
BECAUSE WE WERE LIED TO
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME

06:09.169 --> 06:11.772
BY YOU AND BY A COLLEAGUE.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.140
WELL,
I DIDN'T TELL YOU GUYS

06:13.173 --> 06:16.577
BECAUSE I WAS SCARED
THAT YOU WOULD REACT--

06:16.610 --> 06:18.579
REACT LIKE THIS.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.714
YEAH, WELL, EVIDENTLY
YOU KNOW US A LOT BETTER

06:20.748 --> 06:22.850
THAN WE KNOW YOU,
BUT THAT'S GONNA CHANGE

06:22.883 --> 06:24.852
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA BE SPENDING

06:24.885 --> 06:26.420
A LOT MORE TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY

06:26.454 --> 06:28.155
AND A LOT LESS TIME
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.458
WHAT DOES EZRA HAVE TO DO
WITH MY FRIENDS?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.860
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
CUTTING HIM OFF COMPLETELY,

06:32.893 --> 06:34.928
AND THAT MEANS NOT
EVEN SAYING GOODBYE.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.797
IS THAT CLEAR?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.004
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

06:45.138 --> 06:47.107
WHAT?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.842
DO YOU LIKE HIM?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.611
I DID.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.157
HI.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.762
HEY, COULD WE TALK?

07:11.699 --> 07:14.167
CAN WE DO IT SOMEPLACE
A LITTLE BIT MORE PRIVATE?

07:20.974 --> 07:24.011
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU WANT ANSWERS,

07:24.044 --> 07:25.613
AND I'M CLOSE,

07:25.646 --> 07:29.249
I'M SO CLOSE
TO GIVING THEM TO YOU,

07:29.282 --> 07:32.653
BUT IT'S...
IT'S JUST STILL NOT SAFE.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.223
THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.761
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.798
SHUTTING YOU OUT
IS KILLING ME.

07:44.832 --> 07:48.536
SO YOU CAME HERE
TO TELL ME YOU
 CAN'T BE HERE.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.576
( chuckles )

08:07.287 --> 08:09.122
HEY!

08:09.156 --> 08:11.091
HEY, YOU.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.693
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.995
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
GAVE ME HOMEWORK,
REMEMBER?

08:15.028 --> 08:16.997
YOU'RE DOING THAT HERE?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.732
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT I'M WORKING ON.

08:18.766 --> 08:24.538
SO, UH, WHEN DO I GET
INDUCTED INTO THIS
SECRET SOCIETY?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.840
HEY, I LIKE PLAYING
 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY,

08:26.874 --> 08:29.877
BUT, UH, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY
DOESN'T TRUST ME.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.679
WHO?

08:31.712 --> 08:32.946
ME?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.881
CALEB! COME ON,
I TRUST YOU.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.552
BUT... NOT WITH THIS.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.654
WE HAVE GOTTEN NAKED
TOGETHER IN MORE WAYS
THAN ONE, HAN.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.655
WHY ARE WE
SUDDENLY STRANGERS

08:42.690 --> 08:44.024
WHEN IT COMES
TO A STOLEN PHONE?

08:44.057 --> 08:47.127
IT WASN'T STOLEN;
WE FOUND IT.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.563
WHY DON'T I BELIEVE THAT?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.133
OH, HEY, LUCAS!

08:57.370 --> 08:59.673
ARE WE STILL ON
FOR AFTER SCHOOL?

08:59.707 --> 09:02.175
OH, UM...
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT BE...

09:02.209 --> 09:04.244
PLEASE DON'T BAG ON ME.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.880
OKAY, IF I DON'T GET
AT LEAST A B-PLUS
ON THIS TEST...

09:06.914 --> 09:08.281
PLEASE.
PLEASE PLEASE.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.850
FINE.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.852
I CAN GIVE YOU,
LIKE, AN HOUR.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.321
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, LUCAS.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.824
MM-HM.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.028
SO, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS PHONE STUFF LATER?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.997
MAYBE. SEE YOU AT LUNCH.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.004
I DON'T-- I DON'T GET IT!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, JENNA!

09:33.106 --> 09:35.342
HEY, HEY! CAN WE NOT
DO THIS ON THE PHONE, PLEASE?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.344
PLEASE, I'M OUTSIDE
YOUR HOUSE.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.313
STOP PUNISHING ME
AND JUST OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

09:42.716 --> 09:44.084
PLEASE!

09:44.117 --> 09:46.353
( pounding on door )
WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:46.386 --> 09:49.089
IT'S BEEN LIKE FIGHT CLUB
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.691
THEY WERE
ARGUING ON THE PORCH.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.092
SHE SLAMMED THE DOOR
IN HIS FACE.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.695
THIS STARTED LAST NIGHT?
I THINK IT'S NERVES.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.697
JENNA PLAYS IT COOL,
BUT SHE'S FREAKING

09:56.730 --> 09:58.365
ABOUT HAVING
THE EYE OPERATION.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.267
YEAH? WELL,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

10:00.300 --> 10:01.969
WHEN IT'S NOT JUST
THE TWO OF US.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.738
NO, NO, THE MISTAKE
WAS PULLING IN SOMEBODY ELSE.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.741
ASKING HIM TO HELP US
WAS A BAD IDEA, JENNA.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.277
IT WAS A BAD MOVE.
NO, NO, I WARNED YOU. NO.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.079
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.413
THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
IT'S ABOUT AN EYE OPERATION.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.416
WHO IS "HE"?
WHO ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.719
JUST-- CAN YOU--
CAN YOU WAIT JUST A SECOND?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.888
JENNA, DON'T HANG UP.
ANSWER THE DOOR!

10:20.921 --> 10:22.890
UH... JENNA, NO, WAIT.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.291
JUST WAIT A SECOND.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.326
DON'T HANG UP,
JUST COME TO THE DOOR.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.696
JENNA?

10:28.729 --> 10:29.997
JENNA?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.266
DAMN IT!

11:01.261 --> 11:03.931
EMILY, YOU'VE GOT
ABOUT FIVE MORE MINUTES.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.202
IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN TAKE THIS ON MONDAY?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.705
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO FINISH THE LAST
FEW CHAPTERS.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.306
IT'S A MAKEUP TEST,
EMILY.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.409
THE CLASS HAS MOVED ON
TO ANOTHER BOOK.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.448
WHAT ABOUT
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.016
I CAN'T.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.384
I HAVE COMMUNITY SERVICE.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.887
THEY GAVE ME
ADDITIONAL HOURS FOR...

11:26.920 --> 11:28.756
UM... FIGHTING WITH SPENCER.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.457
ARE YOU STILL
PICKING UP TRASH?

11:30.490 --> 11:33.026
PHONE CALLS.
IT'S A COMMUNITY
CRISIS HOTLINE,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.862
AND TODAY IS MY FIRST DAY.

11:34.895 --> 11:39.032
WELL, YOU GIRLS
SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF
EXPERIENCE WITH CRISES.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.401
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP SOMEONE
LEARN HOW TO AVOID THEM.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.006
HOW 'BOUT AFTER SCHOOL
ON MONDAY?

11:56.116 --> 11:59.219
EMILY.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.355
WHAT ELSE DO I NOT KNOW
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?

12:02.389 --> 12:05.192
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.463
WASN'T FAIR OF ME
TO ASK THAT. SORRY.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.835
ARIA'S THE SAME PERSON
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN,

12:14.868 --> 12:16.837
SOMEONE YOU CAN BE PROUD OF.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.138
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.850
HEY, THERE, IT'S EZRA.
 CAN'T TALK, BUT YOU CAN,

12:29.883 --> 12:32.986
SOON AS YOU HEAR
 THE... ( beep )

12:33.020 --> 12:34.387
HI, IT'S ME.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.123
UM, I'M USING HANNA'S PHONE

12:36.156 --> 12:37.490
'CAUSE I'M SCARED
MY DAD'S GONNA START

12:37.524 --> 12:40.393
COMBING THROUGH
MY PHONE BILLS.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.130
IT'S STILL
PRETTY INTENSE, BUT...

12:43.163 --> 12:44.865
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT CAN'T CHANGE.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.834
THEY'RE GONNA COME AROUND.
I-I KNOW THAT THEY WILL.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.003
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.005
I HATE NOT BEING ABLE
TO SEE YOU.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.306
( beep )

13:00.080 --> 13:02.115
THANKS.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.592
HEY. HOW WAS YOUR TEST?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.461
I'M DOING A MAKEUP
OF A MAKEUP.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.330
I'VE GOT TO RUN.
COMMUNITY SERVICE STARTS
AT FOUR P.M., SHARP.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.233
WAIT. YOURS IS TODAY?
I WAS HOPING YOU'D BE ABLE

13:20.267 --> 13:22.035
TO COME SNOOP AROUND
JASON'S HOUSE WITH ME.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.871
JASON'S? WHY JASON?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.305
WELL, IF JENNA
AND GARRETT HAVE A HELPER,

13:25.338 --> 13:27.074
AND IT'S A HE,
WHERE DOES YOUR MIND GO?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.076
IT'S GOING TO
COMMUNITY SERVICE.
ASK ARIA.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.178
I DID. SHE'S
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.579
AND BESIDES,
SHE REALLY BELIEVES

13:32.612 --> 13:34.347
THAT JASON'S BEEN
OUT OF TOWN FOR WEEKS.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.050
THEN ASK HANNA.
HANNA SPENT
ALL OF CHEM CLASS...

13:37.084 --> 13:38.418
DRAWING PICTURES OF ME
IN A POINTY HAT

13:38.451 --> 13:39.987
AND A WART ON MY NOSE.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.121
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.555
OFFER HER YOUR LAKE HOUSE.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.557
SHE NEEDS SOME SERIOUS
FACE TIME WITH CALEB.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.894
MY LAKE HOUSE?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.396
I'VE ALREADY MADE SOME
MEMORIES ON THAT COUCH
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.067
SHE-- SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

13:59.907 --> 14:01.508
THAT WAS MY NANA'S COUCH.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.312
SO, WHO DITCHED
THE UNION FIRST?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.880
SOUTH CAROLINA?

14:06.914 --> 14:10.017
DID WE MAKE
A CARD FOR THEM?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.252
GEORGIA, ALABAMA...

14:13.921 --> 14:16.289
HELLO? WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:16.323 --> 14:19.392
UM, SORRY, I WAS JUST...

14:19.426 --> 14:20.994
UH, THINKING
ABOUT LOUISIANA.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.096
PLEASE DON'T
CHECK OUT ON ME.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.465
OKAY, I NEED YOU.
I CAN'T EVEN SPELL
"LOUISIANA."

14:25.498 --> 14:27.200
( telephone rings )

14:27.234 --> 14:29.269
IS THAT CALEB?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.038
SPENCER.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.442
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A CARD FOR MARYLAND?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.511
BORDER STATE--
DIDN'T SECEDE UNTIL
AFTER THE WAR BEGAN.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.353
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

14:46.386 --> 14:49.489
UH, SHE OFFERED ME
AND CALEB HER LAKE HOUSE.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.692
AND YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.694
OH, I'M INTERESTED,
BUT IF I WAIT AN HOUR,

14:54.727 --> 14:58.231
SHE MIGHT THROW IN
MAID SERVICE, AND IF
I WAIT TWO HOURS,

14:58.265 --> 15:00.367
SHE MIGHT SEND A HELICOPTER
TO TAKE US THERE.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.036
UM... I'M GONNA MAKE
A NEW CARD FOR VIRGINIA.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.105
OR IF I WAITED THREE HOURS,

15:05.138 --> 15:07.374
SHE MIGHT LET ME HAVE
CALEB'S BIRTHDAY PARTY THERE.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.410
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S AWESOME--

15:10.443 --> 15:12.179
A SURPRISE PARTY
AT THE LAKE HOUSE!

15:12.212 --> 15:14.181
OH, LOOK. WE
HAVE TWO CARDS
FOR NORTH CAROLINA.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.083
LUCAS, YOU COULD HELP ME.
WE COULD DO IT TOGETHER.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.219
( chuckles ) NO, NO,
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.453
OF COURSE I NEED YOU.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.222
YOU'RE, LIKE,
HIS BEST FRIEND.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.491
YOU'RE ROOMIES.
YOU'RE LIKE PATRICK
AND SPONGEBOB.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.294
LOOK, HANNA,
IF WE'RE NOT GONNA STUDY,

15:27.327 --> 15:28.695
I REALLY
NEED TO GET GOING.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.597
THAT LAKE HOUSE
IS PERFECT.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.566
IT'S SECLUDED.
THERE'S A DOCK,
A ROWBOAT, A PIER,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.668
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD HANG
A BIG SIGN THERE.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.705
THAT SOUNDS REALLY
FUN... AND PRICEY.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.441
I'M NOT REALLY IN
A POSITION TO PITCH IN.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.410
NO. NO, I'LL PAY
FOR EVERYTHING.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.213
I JUST NEED YOUR HELP.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.616
CALEB'S PROBABLY NEVER
EVEN HAD A BIRTHDAY
PARTY BEFORE.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.085
AND IF WE DO THIS,

15:52.119 --> 15:53.586
IT WOULD MEAN
A LOT TO HIM.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.462
YOU'LL FIND A CONTRACT
IN THE BACK OF THE PACKET.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.497
EVERY VOLUNTEER
MUST SIGN IT.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.167
THIS PROTECTS YOU
AND THE CALLER.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.670
THERE MUST BE
ANONYMITY ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE PHONE.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.373
YOU LOOK OVERWHELMED.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.642
RELAX. NONE OF YOU
WILL BE ANSWERING
ANY CALLS

16:15.675 --> 16:18.045
UNTIL YOU'VE HAD
SOME TRAINING.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.779
KEEP IN MIND,
MOST OF THE TIME

16:19.812 --> 16:23.116
THEY REALLY JUST NEED
SOMEONE TO LISTEN.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.320
SO, WHO WANTS TO
READ WITH ME? EMILY?

16:27.354 --> 16:30.023
HERE. HELP ME OUT.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.426
THIS IS A TRANSCRIPT
OF A CALL THAT CAME
IN LAST NIGHT.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.162
READY?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.430
( clears throat )
UM...

16:37.464 --> 16:39.599
"CRISIS HOTLINE.
CAN I HELP YOU?"

16:39.632 --> 16:41.368
"I NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.670
"I'M IN A BAD PLACE,
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.672
I ALMOST GOT CAUGHT
TONIGHT."

16:45.705 --> 16:47.240
"WELL, CALLING HERE
IS A GOOD START.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.509
UH, LET'S
TALK THIS THROUGH ."

16:49.542 --> 16:51.178
"I WAS ASKED TO DO
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

16:51.211 --> 16:54.147
AND I TRIED MY BEST,
BUT I SCREWED IT UP."

16:54.181 --> 16:56.716
"OKAY. BUT MAYBE WE
CAN FIGURE THIS OUT,
AND THE SITUATION--"

16:56.749 --> 17:00.153
"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S GONE, AND I CAN'T
GET IT BACK.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.821
ALL I COULD DO
IS SHUT IT DOWN."

17:01.854 --> 17:04.723
"SHUT WHAT DOWN?
CAN YOU TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE LOST?"

17:04.757 --> 17:06.459
"THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA FORGIVE ME.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.127
"THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
MY LIFE A LIVING HELL.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.297
I MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD."

17:12.531 --> 17:15.468
DID THIS PERSON
CALL HERE LAST NIGHT?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.337
AND WAS IT
A MAN OR A WOMAN?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.605
NOT RELEVANT.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.074
LET'S CONTINUE.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.612
EMILY...

17:25.645 --> 17:27.780
YOU OKAY?

17:29.682 --> 17:31.251
WHAT?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.420
OH. SORRY.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.392
( pounding on door )

17:53.506 --> 17:56.276
MAY I COME IN?

17:56.309 --> 17:59.446
ELLA AND I ONCE WENT
TO A PARTY IN THIS BUILDING,

17:59.479 --> 18:02.582
BACK IN GRAD SCHOOL DAYS.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.851
OH.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.387
DO YOU WANT SOME WATER,
OR A-- A BEER?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.088
NO, NO THANKS.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.860
I, UH, I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT

18:13.893 --> 18:16.163
SINCE YOU CAME
OVER TO OUR HOUSE.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.564
YEAH, YEAH, BYRON, I--

18:17.597 --> 18:20.433
NO, LET--
LET ME GET THIS OUT.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.470
I'VE BEEN TEACHING
FOR 17 YEARS.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.338
I KNOW
HOW TRICKY IT CAN BE

18:25.372 --> 18:30.410
TO NAVIGATE SOME
TEACHER/STUDENT
RELATIONSHIPS,

18:30.443 --> 18:33.346
AND I HAVE MADE
SOME BAD CHOICES

18:33.380 --> 18:35.915
THAT I LATER REGRETTED,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.817
THOUGH IT DIDN'T
INVOLVE A MINOR.

18:39.886 --> 18:44.857
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT
MY DAUGHTER WENT THROUGH
A VERY TRAUMATIC YEAR...

18:44.891 --> 18:46.926
AND THAT YOU WERE
THERE FOR HER...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.895
IN A WAY HER PARENTS
COULDN'T BE.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.768
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT OKAY.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.807
SO, BEFORE I LEAVE
HERE TONIGHT,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.276
I WANT YOUR ASSURANCE
THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE,

19:03.310 --> 19:04.944
AND THAT IT'S OVER,

19:04.977 --> 19:07.947
AND THAT YOU WILL
NEVER SEE ARIA AGAIN.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.418
LOOK, AS SOON
AS I REALIZED
SHE WAS MY STUDENT,

19:11.451 --> 19:15.555
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG.
IT COULDN'T GO ON.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.790
WHICH IS WHY I TOOK
THE JOB AT HOLLIS.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.727
YOU GIVING THAT TO ME
WAS AN INCREDIBLE GIFT,

19:20.760 --> 19:22.229
AND I...

19:24.331 --> 19:26.299
HAS SHE BEEN HERE?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.700
SORRY, WHAT?

19:27.734 --> 19:30.737
IS THIS WHERE YOU
SPENT YOUR TIME TOGETHER?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.339
BYRON, AS I SAID--

19:32.372 --> 19:34.541
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.943
I DON'T THINK
YOU HEARD ME.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.246
YOU'RE NEVER
SEEING ARIA AGAIN.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.514
EVER.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.584
AND I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT THE POLICE SEE TO THAT.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.432
OKAY, SO, CLARIFICATION:

19:59.466 --> 20:01.501
IS OUR INVITATION
COMING BY SNAIL-MAIL?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.869
WHAT?

20:02.902 --> 20:05.538
DID YOU SEND IT TO
MY ADDRESS OR HERS?

20:05.572 --> 20:08.508
OH, UH... I DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D WANT TO COME.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.911
TO A ROCKIN' PARTY
AT SPENCER'S LAKE HOUSE?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.646
I CAN SEE WHERE
YOU'D BE CONFUSED.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.814
WE'LL BE THERE.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.016
YEAH, UM,
IT'S A SURPRISE PARTY.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.718
FOR... CALEB.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.287
SURPRISE!

20:20.320 --> 20:22.889
HE AND I ARE FRIENDS NOW.
ALL IS FORGIVEN.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.263
"I ALMOST
GOT CAUGHT TONIGHT.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.664
"IT'S GONE,
AND I CAN'T GET IT BACK.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.032
I MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD."

20:33.065 --> 20:35.001
TELL ME THAT DOES NOT
SOUND LIKE "A's" HELPER.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.370
THEY LET YOU KEEP THIS?
NO! THEY DON'T
KNOW I HAVE IT.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.772
OKAY, SO I HAVE GOOD NEWS
AND I HAVE BAD NEWS.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.974
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.476
I WOKE UP TO IT.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.877
EMILY TAPED IT TO OUR
BATHROOM MIRROR.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.379
WE KNEW THAT IT WASN'T
JENNA IN THE GREENHOUSE,

20:46.413 --> 20:47.647
BUT NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE IT WASN'T--

20:47.680 --> 20:49.582
IT WAS HER DRONE.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.818
OKAY, I THINK THAT WE
SHOULD ALL BE WORKING
AT THIS CRISIS HOTLINE.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.820
I MEAN, IF "A's" HELPER
CALLS BACK, WE CAN--

20:53.853 --> 20:55.455
NNNN...NO.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.524
I CAN'T WORK AT A HOTLINE.
I'M ON LOCKDOWN.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.892
I CAN BARELY EVEN PEE
WITHOUT A CHAPERONE.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.894
WAIT, YOU'RE COMING TO
MY SURPRISE PARTY, RIGHT?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.030
NOPE, NOT UNLESS YOU'RE
THROWING IT IN MY CLOSET.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.600
HEY, GUYS,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.275
I FINALLY CRACKED
ONE OF THESE FILES...

21:22.749 --> 21:24.684
BUT I'M GUESSING THAT
WASN'T WHAT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.322
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
NO, THIS IS--

21:29.356 --> 21:30.690
THIS IS REALLY GREAT.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.660
COULD YOU PLEASE FORWARD
THIS PICTURE TO ALL OF US?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.762
I REALLY HAVE
TO GET TO CLASS.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.864
THANKS, CALEB.
YEAH, THANK YOU.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.770
HANNA, WHAT ELSE HAPPENED
WHEN I WAS IN CALIFORNIA?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.772
YOU, YOUR FRIENDS,
EVERYONE'S ACTING
REALLY STRANGE--

21:45.805 --> 21:46.906
EVEN LUCAS.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.608
NO ONE'S LOOKING ME
IN THE EYE.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.877
WELL, I'M LOOKING AT YOU,

21:50.910 --> 21:53.880
AND I'M WONDERING WHAT
TO GET YOU FOR YOUR
BIRTHDAY DINNER.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.983
WE CAN GET TAKEOUT,
JUST FOR THE TWO OF US.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.618
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.654
HOW 'BOUT A BIG,
STEAMING PLATE
OF THE TRUTH,

22:01.688 --> 22:03.122
STARTING WITH
THIS FOUND PHONE.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.824
NO, CALEB, I DIDN'T
LIE ABOUT THAT.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.460
I JUST CAN'T SAY ANYMORE.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.828
AND YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR US?

22:08.861 --> 22:11.097
NO, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.965
WE DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM, DO WE?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.967
WE DO IF YOU'RE HOLDING
BACK THE IMPORTANT STUFF.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.704
THAT'S NOT
THE IMPORTANT STUFF.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.672
THIS IS
THE IMPORTANT STUFF.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.386
I MEAN, HE ACTUALLY
STOOD THERE IN FRONT OF ME
JUSTIFYING HIS BEHAVIOR.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.522
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.
YES, I SHOULD HAVE.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.425
WELL, I FOLLOWED AN--
AN IMPULSE, ELLA.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.892
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

22:39.926 --> 22:42.629
AN ASPIRIN!
HOW DID THIS FAMILY GO

22:42.662 --> 22:44.497
FROM A HAPPY CHRISTMAS
CARD IN EUROPE

22:44.531 --> 22:46.899
TO THIS FRACTURED,
DECEITFUL MESS?

22:46.933 --> 22:48.501
ELLA, DON'T GIVE
ME THAT. STOP.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.470
YOU KNOW, "GREETINGS
FROM DYSFUNCTION
JUNCTION."

22:50.503 --> 22:52.739
THAT ONE CAN'T GO
TO SCHOOL BECAUSE
HE'S TOO DEPRESSED,

22:52.772 --> 22:55.041
AND THIS ONE ONLY
GOES SO SHE CAN
DATE HER TEACHER.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.909
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.979
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
WHY NOT?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.448
BECAUSE WE HAVE
A DAUGHTER WHOSE
REPUTATION

23:01.481 --> 23:03.182
WILL BE RUINED
JUST AS MUCH AS HIS.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.586
SHE JUST GOT DONE
DOING COMMUNITY
SERVICE LAST WEEK!

23:06.619 --> 23:08.187
ELLA, I REALLY THINK--
NO! STOP!

23:08.220 --> 23:10.790
IT IS HARD ENOUGH FOR HER
TO WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.059
THE BELL TOWER,
AND THEN THE SHOVEL.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.163
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO SUBJECT YOUR DAUGHTER
TO MORE POLICE SCRUTINY?

23:17.196 --> 23:18.798
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS?

23:18.831 --> 23:20.633
OF COURSE NOT.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.201
BUT BEFORE WE
PICK UP OUR TORCHES
AND PITCHFORKS,

23:22.234 --> 23:25.538
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT
AND FIGURE IT OUT.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.207
I WANT TO PROTECT ARIA.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.978
WE RAISED HER
TO BE INDEPENDENT
AND OPEN-MINDED,

23:32.011 --> 23:35.848
AND WE DON'T GET TO BE
SHOCKED IF THAT IS NOW
WHO SHE IS.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.859
MR. FITZ?

23:46.893 --> 23:50.563
HANNA. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.164
OH, I PICKED UP
A BIRTHDAY CAKE

23:52.198 --> 23:55.101
FROM THE BAKERY
AROUND THE CORNER.

23:56.703 --> 23:59.539
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU
PLEASE LEAVE THAT OPEN?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.741
UM...

24:01.774 --> 24:04.110
YEAH, SURE.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.915
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING DOWN WITH
ARIA'S PARENTS,

24:08.948 --> 24:11.784
AND...

24:11.818 --> 24:14.587
I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT THE REST OF US
DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.458
TWO PEOPLE WHO LOVE
EACH OTHER THAT MUCH
SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

24:29.736 --> 24:33.740
( telephone rings )

24:33.773 --> 24:35.007
( ring )

24:36.142 --> 24:38.945
CRISIS HOTLINE.
CAN I HELP YOU?

24:38.978 --> 24:43.950
YES, WE DID.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.952
I'M GLAD YOU
REACHED OUT AGAIN.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.655
HAS THE SITUATION
GOTTEN WORSE?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.657
Young Man: MUCH.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.661
I'M IN WAY TOO DEEP.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.130
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.866
I-I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.868
WE ALWAYS HAVE CHOICES.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.302
NO, NO. I SHOULD HAVE
 KNOWN BETTER.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.905
I JUST...
 I JUST GOT SUCKED IN,

25:05.938 --> 25:08.608
AND IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE...

25:08.641 --> 25:11.010
LIKE I FINALLY
 HAD SOME POWER,

25:11.043 --> 25:14.213
AND NOW I-I JUST
 CAN'T MAKE THIS GO
 AWAY WITHOUT...

25:14.246 --> 25:16.015
That's Lucas!

25:16.048 --> 25:18.751
I NEVER WANTED
 TO HURT ANYBODY,
 BUT NOW I HAVE TO.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.587
TAKE A BREATH.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.121
MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU COME UP
WITH A SOLUTION.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.724
NO, THERE IS ONLY
 ONE SOLUTION,

25:24.757 --> 25:27.026
AND IT'S NOT
 GONNA BE PRETTY.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.028
I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.764
I JUST... HATE TO DO IT.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.065
( click )

25:39.606 --> 25:40.973
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN A PERFECT BOW.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.709
JUST LISTEN TO US.
WE BOTH HEARD THE VOICE.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.243
IT WAS DEFINITELY LUCAS
ON THE OTHER END.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.646
NO, YOU BOTH HEARD
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.048
LUCAS MAY BE ABLE
TO GET HIS HANDS ON
ILLEGAL FIRECRACKERS,

25:49.081 --> 25:51.250
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S "A's" EVIL ELF.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.985
HANNA, YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT, OKAY?

25:53.019 --> 25:55.087
LUCAS HATED ALISON
JUST AS MUCH AS
JENNA DID.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.723
SHE COULD HAVE
EASILY RECRUITED HIM.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.190
IT WOULDN'T TAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF PERSUASION.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.326
NO. HE HAS BEEN
AN INCREDIBLE FRIEND TO ME.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.894
HE BROUGHT
CALEB BACK TO TOWN.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.763
HE'S NOW HELPING ME
THROW THIS PARTY.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.633
SO HE CAN PLAY YOU.
SO HE CAN GAIN YOUR TRUST.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.669
I MEAN, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE STILL SEES ALISON
WHENEVER HE LOOKS AT US.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.070
NO, HE'S OVER THAT.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.872
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE "A"
IS PRESSURING LUCAS

26:12.905 --> 26:14.607
JUST LIKE
"A" DID WITH US.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.775
I MEAN, IF "A" HAS
SOMETHING ON HIM--

26:15.808 --> 26:17.810
DID YOU RECORD
THIS CONVERSATION?

26:17.844 --> 26:19.145
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER PROOF?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.047
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.715
WELL, THEN, DROP IT.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.050
HANNA! IT WAS LUCAS
THAT WAS IN THE GREENHOUSE.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.652
THAT'S WHO DROPPED
THE PHONE.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.086
THAT'S WHO YOU HIT
WITH YOUR CAR.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.655
REALLY?

26:28.688 --> 26:30.723
DID YOU SEE BRUISES
THROUGH THE TELEPHONE TOO?

26:30.757 --> 26:35.094
LUCAS HAS HAD MY BACK
FOR A LONG TIME, OKAY?

26:35.127 --> 26:36.763
HE MAY HAVE HAD AN AXE
TO GRIND WITH ALISON,

26:36.796 --> 26:39.131
BUT WHICH ONE OF US DIDN'T?

26:40.332 --> 26:43.770
HANNA.
NO. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.005
HE'S TOO EASY OF A TARGET.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.910
( telephone ringing )

26:56.849 --> 26:59.318
( cellphone ringing )

27:01.754 --> 27:02.989
HELLO?

27:03.022 --> 27:04.390
EZRA.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.393
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
 CALLING HERE.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.730
NO, I-I KNOW.
I REALLY NEEDED
TO HEAR YOUR--

27:10.763 --> 27:12.732
I KNOW.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.033
ME TOO.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.137
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL
HERE ANYMORE.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.442
WAS SHE ALONE?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.479
WAS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
IN THAT CAR

28:00.512 --> 28:02.148
GOING TO BOSTON
WITH JENNA?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.283
I HAVE NO IDEA.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.722
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ME IN THAT CAR WITH HER.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.090
WHAT HAPPENED?

28:11.123 --> 28:12.959
I DON'T KNOW.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.961
SHE TURNED ON ME, TOBY.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.063
SHE DOES THAT.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.165
ALL I EVER DID

28:19.198 --> 28:21.433
WAS EVERYTHING
SHE ASKED ME TO DO,

28:21.467 --> 28:24.103
AND ONE DAY, SHE DECIDES
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

28:24.136 --> 28:28.140
WHEN JENNA DOESN'T
NEED PEOPLE ANYMORE,

28:28.174 --> 28:30.109
SHE GETS RID OF THEM.

28:30.142 --> 28:33.512
ALL I SAID WAS,
THIS TOWN IS NOT
GOOD FOR HER,

28:33.545 --> 28:35.081
AND I JUST WISH
WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE--

28:35.114 --> 28:37.416
Y-YOU KNOW, MOVE ON.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.753
MAYBE SHE'S
HAVING TOO MUCH
FUN SETTLING SCORES.

28:40.787 --> 28:43.289
HEY, YOUR STEPSISTER'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
ALL RIGHT?

28:43.322 --> 28:46.292
IF IT WERE ME AND I HAD
TO LEARN EVERYTHING
ALL OVER AGAIN,

28:46.325 --> 28:47.894
I'D BE CURLED UP
IN SOME CORNER.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.395
SHE MAKES THE REST OF US
LOOK LIKE COWARDS.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.998
I NEVER QUESTIONED
HER STRENGTH,

28:52.031 --> 28:54.100
JUST HOW SHE USES IT.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.467
YEAH, WELL,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HER.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.137
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.340
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE FOUND SOME NEW
FRIENDS WHO DO.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.842
OH, YEAH?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.114
WHO ARE HER FRIENDS?

29:08.147 --> 29:11.517
YOU COULD JUST WALK
AWAY, GARRETT. I DID.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.821
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.524
AND IF I HAVE TO
KEEP PROVING THAT
TO HER, I WILL.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.105
ARE YOU SURE
THEY'RE UP HERE?

29:33.139 --> 29:34.974
YES. MY MOM BOUGHT,
LIKE,

29:35.007 --> 29:37.509
A ZILLION TIKI TORCHES
FOR MY DAD'S 40th,

29:37.543 --> 29:39.846
SO THEY'VE GOT TO BE
UP HERE SOMEWHERE.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.147
UGH.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.317
IS IT WORTH TAKING
A SECOND SHOWER FOR?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.553
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

29:47.586 --> 29:50.422
WELL, THE FURNITURE
IS MY NANA'S,

29:50.456 --> 29:53.893
AND THE SPIDERS,
THEY CAME WITH THE HOUSE.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.895
( doorbell rings )

29:55.928 --> 29:57.830
THAT'S THE FOOD.
KEEP LOOKING,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.198
OKAY.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.430
HANNA?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.467
OH, MY GOD.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.036
"A's" BEEN UP HERE.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.476
( creaking sound )

30:47.146 --> 30:48.647
HANNA, IS THAT YOU?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.283
IT'S ME.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.419
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:53.452 --> 30:56.522
LOOKING FOR SOME TOOLS.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.124
WHY?

30:58.157 --> 31:01.160
TO HANG THE BIRTHDAY BANNER.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.963
YEAH, BUT...
WHY UP HERE?

31:03.996 --> 31:07.199
HOW DID YOU... EVEN
KNOW TO COME UP HERE?

31:07.233 --> 31:10.402
I JUST...
FIGURED THEY WOULD
BE STORED UP HERE.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.674
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE...

31:15.707 --> 31:17.409
( trips over object )

31:17.443 --> 31:20.012
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO STORE
THEIR TOOLS IN THE ATTIC.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.248
YEAH.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.384
WE DON'T.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.591
DID MIKE NEED US
TO PICK HIM UP?

31:32.624 --> 31:35.327
NO. GAVIN'S MOM
WAS GONNA TAKE HIM HOME.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.163
THEY WERE GONNA STOP
AND GET A PIZZA.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.173
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.307
WE'LL EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.508
BYRON.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.477
NO, THERE ARE
OTHER RESTAURANTS.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.213
ARIA, COME ON,
WE'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.447
MOM.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.217
LET'S JUST GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.987
Byron: ARIA.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.390
ARIA.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.691
COME ON, WE'RE WALKING.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.535
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.371
I'M HERE IF YOU NEED
TO SPEAK AGAIN.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.509
BYE-BYE.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.445
DID YOU SIGN UP
FOR AN EXTRA SHIFT?

32:26.478 --> 32:28.047
I COULD USE THE HELP.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.983
NO, I'M... ON MY WAY
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.752
BUT I GOT YOUR
MESSAGE ABOUT A MISSING
TRANSCRIPT PAGE,

32:33.785 --> 32:37.056
AND TURNS OUT I DID
STICK IT IN MY FOLDER,

32:37.089 --> 32:39.058
BY ACCIDENT.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.292
WOW.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.995
WOW, I'M GLAD
YOU FOUND IT.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.131
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

32:45.164 --> 32:48.334
( telephone rings )

32:48.367 --> 32:50.136
CRISIS HOTLINE.
CAN I HELP YOU?

32:50.169 --> 32:53.472
( telephone rings )

32:53.505 --> 32:55.241
CAN YOU SPEAK UP, PLEASE?

32:55.274 --> 32:57.576
( telephone rings )

32:59.511 --> 33:02.014
( telephone rings )

33:03.782 --> 33:06.485
CRISIS HOTLINE.
CAN I HELP YOU?

33:06.518 --> 33:10.222
Lucas: I-I CALLED
 THERE YESTERDAY.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.124
WERE YOU THE PERSON
 WHO I SPOKE TO?

33:13.525 --> 33:14.760
YES.

33:16.262 --> 33:19.398
WELL... I'VE MADE
 A DECISION,

33:19.431 --> 33:21.600
AND-- AND I'M NOT WAITING.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.635
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS TONIGHT.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.241
BUT I JUST...

33:32.311 --> 33:35.414
KEEP SEEING HER FACE

33:35.447 --> 33:38.684
AND HOW HARD
 IT'S GONNA BE...

33:38.717 --> 33:40.386
TO LOSE HER...

33:41.487 --> 33:42.821
FOREVER.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.257
Hanna: LUCAS!
ARE YOU UP THERE?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.332
Byron: WE WILL
FIND SOMEWHERE.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.467
IT'S A SMALL TOWN,
BYRON.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.170
WHERE DO YOU WANT US
TO GO FOR A BOWL
OF PASTA, DELAWARE?

33:58.204 --> 33:59.705
LISTEN, IF YOU WOULD
LET ME GO TO THE POLICE,

33:59.738 --> 34:01.707
WE COULD EAT ANYWHERE
WE WANTED TO.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.709
CAN WE NOT HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION

34:03.742 --> 34:06.178
RIGHT HERE
ON THE TOWN SQUARE?

34:06.212 --> 34:07.579
BYRON? ELLA?

34:07.613 --> 34:09.081
HEY!
HEY, RON!

34:09.114 --> 34:10.282
HOW ARE YOU?
HI.

34:10.315 --> 34:13.185
WE THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE STILL OVERSEAS.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.187
OH, YEAH, WE JUST
GOT BACK LAST WEEK.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.655
THE KIDS HAVE BEEN
CRAVING CHEESESTEAKS

34:16.688 --> 34:18.724
EVER SINCE WE HIT
THE TARMAC, SO...

34:18.757 --> 34:22.393
BOY, ARIA, YOU--
YOU'VE REALLY GROWN UP!

34:22.428 --> 34:25.264
NO.
WELL, APPARENTLY
NOT THAT MUCH.

34:25.297 --> 34:29.268
HOLDEN, HEY,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.636
HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?

34:30.668 --> 34:32.271
GOOD.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.772
AT LEAST
SAY IT IN PORTUGUESE.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.373
PRETEND YOU
LEARNED SOMETHING.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.309
OH, NO, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO IMPRESS US.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.877
YOU TAUGHT ARIA
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.
THAT'S PLENTY.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.813
UH... NO, HE...
DIDN'T TEACH ME, ACTUALLY.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.815
TRUE, I... BROKE
HER TRAINING WHEELS

34:44.850 --> 34:47.152
AND THEN SHE
FIGURED OUT THE REST.

34:47.186 --> 34:51.157
HEY, WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE
TO COME OVER FOR DINNER
NEXT WEEKEND?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.791
WE CAN ALL COOK TOGETHER.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.826
YEAH. THAT'LL GIVE
ARIA AND HOLDEN

34:54.860 --> 34:58.330
SOME TIME
TO GET CAUGHT UP.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.171
HANNA.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.438
HANNA!

35:06.472 --> 35:08.440
OH, UM, HAN,
DID YOU REALLY ORDER

35:08.474 --> 35:10.442
12 PIZZAS WITH
GREEN PEPPERS ON 'EM?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.178
NO. WHY?

35:12.211 --> 35:13.612
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT.
AND NOEL'S ALLERGIC.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.414
( text indicator plinks )
CALEB'S ALMOST HERE!

35:15.447 --> 35:16.815
HE'S EARLY!

35:16.848 --> 35:19.185
WHO COMES TO THEIR OWN
SURPRISE PARTY EARLY?

35:19.218 --> 35:20.686
I HAVEN'T EVEN HUNG
THE BANNER YET!

35:20.719 --> 35:23.222
HEY, I'LL DO IT.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.890
HANNA, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.892
"A" HAS BEEN HERE.
"A" HAS BEEN IN THIS HOUSE.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.494
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.362
WHY IS THIS PHONE
NOT WORKING?

35:30.396 --> 35:31.863
THE DOLLS WERE UP THERE!

35:31.897 --> 35:33.732
MY ATTIC MIGHT BE
"A's" SECRET HEADQUARTERS.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.734
PLEASE JUST GO UPSTAIRS,
LOOK AT THAT WALLPAPER--

35:35.767 --> 35:38.304
THAT WALLPAPER HAS BEEN
UP THERE FOR 200 YEARS.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.239
IT CAN WAIT ANOTHER DAY.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.521
HEY.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.589
DID YOU JUST GET HERE?

36:03.529 --> 36:05.297
CHECK OUT THIS CAKE.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.367
HANNA REALLY WENT ALL OUT.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.504
WHEN SHE LOVES SOMEBODY,
SHE DOESN'T HOLD BACK.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.676
YEAH. I KNOW.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.881
CALEB'S
A REALLY LUCKY GUY.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.383
SO ARE YOU.

36:26.352 --> 36:29.421
WHEN YOU'RE
HANNA'S FRIEND,
SHE FORGIVES A LOT.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.826
PLEASE DON'T DO
SOMETHING YOU'RE
GONNA REGRET, LUCAS.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.479
FINALLY! YOU'RE HERE!
YOU HAVE TO COME UP
TO THE ATTIC WITH ME.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.248
WAIT. I THINK I JUST
MADE THINGS WORSE
WITH LUCAS.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.750
I THINK HE KNOWS
THAT I KNEW IT WAS
HIM ON THE PHONE.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.786
OKAY, WE'VE GOT
TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.921
WILL YOU PLEASE SPEAK
TO HANNA? SHE'S NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.523
WHERE IS SHE?

37:04.556 --> 37:06.658
MONA. HEY.
HAVE YOU SEEN HANNA?

37:06.692 --> 37:08.360
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.828
YEAH, SHE AND LUCAS
JUST WENT TO SET UP
THE FIREWORKS.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.630
WHAT? WHERE?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.832
AT THE PIER
ACROSS THE LAKE.
THEY TOOK THE BOAT.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.234
DID THEY NEED PERMISSION?

37:56.508 --> 37:58.610
YOU KNOW, WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.313
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST HANG THE SIGN
AND FORGET THE FIREWORKS.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.318
HANNA.
WHAT?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.455
LUCAS.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.525
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
WHY DID YOU STOP?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.401
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:22.434 --> 38:24.936
DO YOUR ARMS HURT?

38:24.970 --> 38:27.439
HERE, SWITCH WITH ME.
I'LL ROW.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.375
SIT DOWN.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.514
Spencer: HANNA!

38:35.547 --> 38:36.882
WHERE ARE YOU?

38:36.915 --> 38:38.884
DO YOU THINK
CALEB'S HERE?

38:38.917 --> 38:40.686
COME ON,
LET'S JUST GO BACK.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.821
WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.556
LET'S JUST
FORGET THE SIGN.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.558
OKAY, I'M GETTING
REALLY COLD.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.859
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.528
CAN YOU PLEASE
TURN THIS AROUND?

38:49.561 --> 38:51.129
Spencer: HANNA,
ANSWER ME!
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.499
Emily: HANNA!
Spencer: HANNA!

38:56.502 --> 38:58.103
LUCAS, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST TURN THIS AROUND?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.105
DAMN IT, HANNA,
THIS IS HARD ENOUGH
FOR ME TO DO,

39:00.138 --> 39:02.007
AND I NEED TO DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.376
FORGET THE FIREWORKS,
FORGET THE SIGN,
FORGET EVERYTHING.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.911
OKAY,
IF I ASKED TOO MUCH,

39:05.944 --> 39:07.513
IF I TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF YOU, I'M SORRY...!

39:07.546 --> 39:10.015
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
THE STUPID FIREWORKS, HANNA!

39:10.048 --> 39:11.817
AAH!

39:21.893 --> 39:23.795
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.664
NO, I CAN HEAR THINGS,
AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.933
HANNA! ANSWER US!

39:27.966 --> 39:29.835
LET'S GET IN THE CAR.
THEY'RE PROBABLY
AT THE PIER.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.036
NO, EMILY,
IT'S A WINDING ROAD.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.538
BY THE TIME THAT
WE GET AROUND--

39:32.571 --> 39:34.406
WELL, WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING, OKAY?

39:43.715 --> 39:44.783
( Hanna cries out )

39:52.458 --> 39:53.692
AAH!

39:55.126 --> 39:57.095
HANNA!

39:58.229 --> 40:00.866
HANNA, ANSWER US!

40:00.899 --> 40:02.000
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.603
GO INSIDE. GO!

40:04.636 --> 40:06.572
HANNA!

40:06.605 --> 40:07.839
HANNA!

40:09.875 --> 40:11.443
HANNA!

40:11.477 --> 40:13.545
( telephone rings )

40:16.515 --> 40:18.684
( ring )

40:18.717 --> 40:20.552
( machine clacks )
 HEY, THERE, IT'S EZRA.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.954
CAN'T TALK, BUT YOU CAN,
 SOON AS YOU HEAR THE..

40:22.988 --> 40:24.523
( beep )

40:24.556 --> 40:27.593
Aria: Hi, it's me.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.160
So, I still don't know
what to say about my dad,

40:29.194 --> 40:32.498
but... I think that my mom
might be coming around.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.932
She stopped my dad
from calling the cops.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.668
That's-- that's a good
sign, right?

40:36.702 --> 40:39.070
This is not
a goodbye call,

40:39.104 --> 40:42.508
this is just a please
be patient call. I miss--

40:42.541 --> 40:44.676
( knock on door )

40:44.710 --> 40:45.944
HEY.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.613
WHAT'S UP?

40:47.646 --> 40:50.916
WELL, YOUR FATHER
AND I INVITED HOLDEN
AND HIS FAMILY

40:50.949 --> 40:53.184
OVER FOR DINNER SUNDAY.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.654
OH. GREAT.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.923
I WAS ACTUALLY
JUST ON THE PHONE
WITH HOLDEN.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.958
REALLY?
Yep.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.860
DID HE CALL YOU?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.695
NO. I CALLED HIM.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.697
WE WERE JUST THINKING
ABOUT MAYBE GETTING
TOGETHER

41:05.731 --> 41:08.266
AND SEEING A MOVIE
OR SOMETHING.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.936
BUT IF
I'M STILL GROUNDED...

41:10.969 --> 41:14.540
WELL, LET ME TALK
TO YOUR DAD ABOUT IT.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.242
IT IT'S HOLDEN, YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT BE OKAY.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.757
( onlookers murmuring )

41:31.790 --> 41:35.561
Man: ...a couple
were missing, they said.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.909
Girl: OH, LOOK!
Boy: WHO'S OUT THERE?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.277
Spencer: OH, MY GOD!

41:52.310 --> 41:54.179
HAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

41:54.212 --> 41:56.047
HANNA, COME HERE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

41:56.081 --> 41:57.616
WHERE'S LUCAS?

41:57.649 --> 41:59.618
Boy: WHERE'S LUCAS?

41:59.651 --> 42:03.154
SOMEBODY GET A BLANKET!
HURRY!

42:03.188 --> 42:05.657
I'VE GOT YOU.
IS SHE OKAY?

42:05.691 --> 42:07.025
SHE SWAM BACK!

42:07.058 --> 42:08.660
Mona: WHAT'S GOING ON?

42:08.694 --> 42:10.061
WHY IS EVERYBODY
OUT HERE?

42:10.095 --> 42:12.063
Spencer:
WHERE WERE YOU?

42:12.097 --> 42:13.699
WE TOOK A DIP.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.200
WHAT?!

42:15.233 --> 42:17.803
NICE NIGHT FOR IT.

42:17.836 --> 42:20.572
( sighs )
IS LUCAS STILL OUT THERE?

42:24.710 --> 42:25.644
Caleb: HANNA.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.549
WHAT'S GOING ON?

42:32.751 --> 42:34.019
SURPRISE.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.789
Girl: OH, MY GOSH.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.128
Boy: NO, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.631
( onlookers murmuring )
