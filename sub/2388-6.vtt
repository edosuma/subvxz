00:01.460 --> 00:03.128
<i>In the fall of 2012,</i>

00:03.212 --> 00:05.506
<i>Nick and Robin
were going strong.</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:07.633
<i>Sometimes it's hard to say
what it is exactly</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:08.926
<i>that makes a couple click.</i>

00:10.469 --> 00:12.304
Wow.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.723
Bravissimo!

00:14.723 --> 00:16.058
<i>Whatever it was,</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:19.394
<i>kids, Nick and Robin
really connected at first.</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:21.855
Hey, you know,
I think I'm really starting

00:21.939 --> 00:24.399
to feel something here...

00:24.483 --> 00:27.903
<i>But then, as often
happens, they started to drift apart.</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:29.154
<i>Why?</i>

00:29.238 --> 00:30.531
<i>Who can say?</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:32.950
Nick and I haven't
had sex in three days.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.535
And it's your fault.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.745
Nick won't have sex
because he pulled his groin muscle,

00:36.745 --> 00:39.248
all 'cause you made him join
your stupid basketball team.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.583
Did you say
"stupid basketball team"?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.544
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh, guys,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.712
we have to rush Robin
to the hospital.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.131
Because somehow,
she swallowed her vocal cords

00:48.215 --> 00:49.925
and they got lodged
in her rectum,

00:49.925 --> 00:52.344
because she's
talking out of her ass.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.346
<i>Over the summer,
Marshall had joined</i>

00:54.346 --> 00:56.390
<i>a midtown professionals
basketball league.</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:59.935
<i>His team of lawyers was called
The Force Majeurs.</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:01.979
<i>Ever since they lost
to a group of accountants,</i>

01:01.979 --> 01:04.106
<i>he'd started getting
a little intense about it.</i>

01:04.106 --> 01:06.775
You sure you didn't have
a ringer or two out there, Joel?

01:06.859 --> 01:08.485
Don't know
what you're talking about.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.612
Good hustle out there,
Aboubakar!

01:13.824 --> 01:16.618
If Joel can use ringers,
then so can we.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.161
And Nick is our best player.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.329
So as far as I'm concerned,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.290
you can both
keep your groins on ice.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.875
Groins on Ice.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.586
Least popular Madison Square Garden
holiday show ever.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.713
Why are you so
into this basketball league?

01:27.713 --> 01:30.174
Robin, it's the Little Ivies
Professionals Over 30

01:30.174 --> 01:31.884
Who Work In Midtown League.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.218
It's The Show!

01:34.428 --> 01:38.432
You know, it's kind of funny,
imagining people icing their groins.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.309
I mean, first they'd be all cold,

01:40.309 --> 01:43.520
and then the ice
would start to melt,

01:43.604 --> 01:48.108
and things would get
all wet and... steamy.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.113
Okay, Lily.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.323
Look, buddy,

01:54.323 --> 01:55.741
I'm also the captain of a team

01:55.741 --> 01:58.619
in the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30
Who Work In Midtown League.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.163
I'm addicted
to the adrenaline, too.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.207
Still, don't you think you're getting
a little obsessive about...

02:03.207 --> 02:04.541
Uh, hold up, hold up.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.629
Are you suggesting that you are
a member of a sports team

02:08.629 --> 02:11.590
and you're the captain?

02:11.590 --> 02:15.677
So says the "C"
I personally sewed onto my jersey.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.722
After Victoria and I broke up,
I had some free time.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.766
So, called up
a few architect friends

02:20.766 --> 02:24.811
and put together a little team
called the T-Squares.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.567
See that?
The floor's uneven.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.986
And that window placement
is rubbish.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.072
You know, if a genie
gave me one wish,

02:35.072 --> 02:37.991
I would knock down that wall
and create a nice flow.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.535
Great wish.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.412
I mean, there's too
much hardwood, right?

02:42.496 --> 02:45.541
Did you nerds actually play
any basketball?

02:45.541 --> 02:51.547
Um, us nerds focused on something
far more important: bonding.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.674
You guys are going to get pounded.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.092
And I am not.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.719
Oh, come on. You can't go
a couple weeks without sex?

02:57.803 --> 03:00.848
Our point guard's a 52-year-old virgin,
happy as a clam.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.724
I'm sure he's quite
a ball handler.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.269
The problem is,
now that we're not having sex,

03:05.269 --> 03:06.478
we're talking more,

03:06.562 --> 03:10.107
and I'm realizing
that Nick is kind of...

03:11.358 --> 03:12.484
dumb.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.777
- Really?
- News to me.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.153
I hadn't noticed that.
- No.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.282
Oh, my God.
You guys think that he's dumb, too?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.741
- So dumb.
- Air bags are sharper.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.452
Hot as lava
but just as thick.

03:35.507 --> 03:39.761
Wow. When did you guys start to notice
that he was kind of dumb?

03:39.845 --> 03:43.765
Well, there was that time
Nick was doing the crossword.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.351
Hey, what's a four-letter word for cut?

03:46.435 --> 03:48.312
- "Nick."
- Yeah?

03:48.312 --> 03:51.440
- Is a four-letter word for cut.
- What is?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.775
- "Nick."
- What?

03:53.859 --> 03:55.694
Oh. I got it.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.322
"Shave."

03:58.322 --> 04:01.742
And there was the comment
about Gypsies.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.954
No, no. I think Gypsies prefer
to be called Romani now.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.957
Do they? Really?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.752
And what do unicorns
and, uh, elves

04:11.752 --> 04:13.754
and leprechauns
prefer to be called?

04:15.506 --> 04:16.924
You do know, uh,

04:16.924 --> 04:20.052
Gypsies are a real ethnic group
that actually exists?

04:20.052 --> 04:24.139
Oh, you guys,
I feel terrible now.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.599
I always thought
they were just made up,

04:25.599 --> 04:29.520
like goblins or trolls or dolphins.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.064
And then there's that story
you told about how you and Nick

04:32.064 --> 04:34.024
picked up
that Danish exchange student

04:34.024 --> 04:35.943
and you all
took a shower together.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.445
I never told a story like that.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.155
Well, no time like the present.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.407
Let's give this
Danish ho a name.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.867
I'm thinking Nadia.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.454
Yeah, she sounds slutty
and bi-curious.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.623
What is wrong with you?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.292
Your kid is right there.
Maybe want to clean it up a lit...

04:53.794 --> 04:55.838
You're wearing a baby
and you're doing pull-ups?

04:55.838 --> 04:58.799
No, Ted, I'm sitting around
getting soft,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.009
'cause that's what champions do.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.680
You know, the problem is,
now that I know how dumb Nick is,

05:04.680 --> 05:07.641
it's kind of making me
reconsider the relationship.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.519
Why? Eventually,
Nick's groin will heal

05:10.519 --> 05:12.229
and you'll be back in Sexville,

05:12.229 --> 05:15.399
where all the crossword puzzles
only have one box to fill.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.276
Talk about
a double standard.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.821
Every time I go after a busty
dullard who can't tell time

05:20.821 --> 05:24.741
or thinks I'm the ghost
of Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm shallow.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.577
But somehow it's okay
for Robin to date a guy

05:26.577 --> 05:28.871
who can't be trusted
around outlets.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.038
Dump him!

05:30.122 --> 05:32.708
Okay, that is ridiculous.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.544
Is Nick a genius? No.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.297
But does he have
average intelligence?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.548
No.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.176
But he is a human being,
with a heart!

05:42.176 --> 05:45.220
And you're afraid if I dump him,
it'll throw off his game.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.056
Robin, he got 36 points
and 17 rebounds last week.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.142
And that was with his shoes
on the wrong feet.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.980
Well, you're probably
all wondering

05:54.980 --> 05:57.441
how the T-Squares' practice
went today.

05:57.441 --> 06:01.278
- The T-What?
- We played up here.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.530
Basketball,
people don't realize,

06:03.614 --> 06:06.116
is all geometry,
physics and engineering.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.035
If you think
like an architect,

06:08.035 --> 06:11.747
you could win a thousand games
without ever touching a ball.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.499
What happened
to your ball?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.251
Some kids from the Hebrew school
next door took it

06:16.335 --> 06:17.794
- and wouldn't give it back.
- Oh.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.963
- Oy.
- Hey.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.173
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.383
- Oh, thanks.
- How'd the breakup with Nick go?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.260
Well...

06:25.344 --> 06:26.887
So, I went to this
fortune teller today

06:26.887 --> 06:28.889
and she said there was
a curse on me.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.518
Did she sell you something
to ward off the curse?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.770
It's like you're
a fortune teller, too.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.732
Nick, um...

06:38.732 --> 06:40.651
- I think we need to talk.
- Yeah.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.612
Uh, it's just...

06:43.612 --> 06:46.156
whoa, these are hard.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.826
Anyway, this $500 bracelet will ward
off evil till the end of the week, so...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.286
Do you think that
you could do,

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
uh, sit-ups or something
while you talk?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.749
Yeah.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.876
Anyway, this fortune teller,

06:57.960 --> 07:00.754
she was able to tell me
all sorts of stuff about my future,

07:00.838 --> 07:04.466
just from my credit cards
and my social security number,

07:04.550 --> 07:06.385
my driver's license...

07:06.385 --> 07:07.845
I knew you'd cave.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.764
Which is why I came up
with a little extra incentive

07:10.848 --> 07:13.183
to break up with Nick.
End it by 8:00 p.m. tonight

07:13.267 --> 07:15.561
or this invite goes live.

07:17.396 --> 07:21.358
"Robin and Patrice's
BFF Fun Day?"

07:21.358 --> 07:24.152
<i>Kids, Patrice
was a coworker of Robin's</i>

07:24.236 --> 07:26.822
<i>who'd become
sort of obsessed with her.</i>

07:26.822 --> 07:28.824
<i>Robin had managed, until now,</i>

07:28.824 --> 07:32.661
<i>to keep Patrice at arm's length.</i>

07:32.661 --> 07:34.872
<i>But if Patrice were invited
to something called</i>

07:34.872 --> 07:37.583
<i>Robin and Patrice's
BFF Fun Day,</i>

07:37.583 --> 07:40.210
<i>she'd latch onto Robin
and never let go.</i>

07:40.294 --> 07:43.172
- Why would you do that?
- Delete that right now!

07:43.172 --> 07:45.132
No! If I don't give you
a little push,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.676
you'll let this drag on
until Nick can have sex again,

07:47.676 --> 07:51.513
and then you'll be right back
to procrastinating on all fours.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.765
I hate to admit it, but the
man in the suit has a point.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.475
Ugh!

07:55.559 --> 07:57.769
Fine, but the playoffs
are coming up soon,

07:57.853 --> 08:00.147
and I can't have this
guy an emotional wreck.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.983
If you do dump him,
at least let him down easy.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.027
Yeah, take him
to a nice restaurant.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.904
Preferably a dessert place.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.405
That way, you won't have
to sit through a whole meal

08:08.405 --> 08:09.865
- before you get to...
- Splitsville.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.783
- Exactly.
- No, Splitsville.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.368
It's a dessert place
right around the corner.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.914
<i>It's sort of the place
to end a relationship.</i>

08:21.919 --> 08:24.171
Uh, Nick, listen.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.590
You are awesome

08:26.590 --> 08:28.842
- and totally sweet...
- Uh-hmm.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.053
But we're just not...

08:32.596 --> 08:34.389
You know where I'm going
with this, right?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.934
No. No clue.

08:36.934 --> 08:40.812
Okay, um...

08:40.896 --> 08:44.024
I don't know if we should
keep seeing each other.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.026
You want to start turning off
the lights during sex?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.653
No. God, no.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.279
No! No.

08:49.363 --> 08:54.201
I am just worried that,
as a couple, we're not working out.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.662
You want to start
going to the gym together?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.747
Okay, no, Nick,
here is the deal.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.165
Okay...

09:00.249 --> 09:03.252
Sorry, babe. I got to take this.
Excuse me.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.254
Hello.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.423
Hey, what's up?

09:08.507 --> 09:10.634
You...

09:10.634 --> 09:12.344
What? I...

09:12.344 --> 09:14.513
I don't understand.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.057
But you...
okay, um, you know what?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.393
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.646
What happened?

09:22.646 --> 09:25.691
I...

09:25.691 --> 09:27.609
I, um...

09:27.693 --> 09:30.612
uh, I'm sorry,
I can't talk about this.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.118
Anyway,

09:36.118 --> 09:38.871
what were you going to say?

09:38.871 --> 09:41.081
Uh...

09:41.081 --> 09:45.627
I was gonna say,
order whatever else you want.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.087
It's on me.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.298
Well, thanks,
but I think I'd just rather

09:49.298 --> 09:50.966
eat it out of a bowl.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.764
Well, no doubt
you're all wondering

09:57.848 --> 09:59.683
how the T-Squares' first game went.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.018
What Squares?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.895
Picture a well-oiled machine.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.271
Your sewing machine?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.982
There were two seconds
left on the clock.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.193
<i>Aboubakar was all over me.</i>

10:09.193 --> 10:11.737
<i>And that's when all my years
of architectural training</i>

10:11.737 --> 10:13.655
<i>came to my aid.</i>

10:13.739 --> 10:17.743
<i>I saw the space in a way
my opponents never would.</i>

10:31.965 --> 10:33.592
Yes!

10:33.592 --> 10:36.386
I told you guys
I'd make one of these!

10:36.470 --> 10:38.305
Turns out, those two points
were taken away

10:38.305 --> 10:41.183
because apparently
the ball went "out of bounds."

10:41.183 --> 10:42.351
But don't worry,

10:42.351 --> 10:44.269
I'm appealing
to the league office.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.606
This Aboubakar, I'm assuming
you showered with the guy?

10:47.606 --> 10:49.983
Paint me a word picture.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.570
- Hello.
- Lil, is Barney there?

10:53.654 --> 10:54.780
He's not answering his phone.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.823
Mm, he's a little busy right now.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.660
- It's Robin.
- Thirty-seven, thirty-eight...

10:59.660 --> 11:01.328
put her on speaker. Thirty-nine...

11:01.328 --> 11:02.913
when did you start being able
to do stuff like this?

11:02.913 --> 11:04.623
A few months ago,
you had to catch your breath

11:04.623 --> 11:06.500
after making a sandwich.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.462
<i>Barney, delete the Robin
and Patrice's BFF Fun Day invite!</i>

11:10.546 --> 11:11.672
Did you break up with Nick yet?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.674
<i>I can't!
He just got some horrible call.</i>

11:13.674 --> 11:15.926
I think a family member might
have died or something.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.513
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

11:19.513 --> 11:21.473
I mean, good that Robin
can't dump him.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.684
The death part,
less good.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.811
Robin, if you dump Nick,

11:25.811 --> 11:28.689
he could get mad
and tear your blouse off.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.315
And then he bites
you on the neck,

11:30.399 --> 11:32.192
not super hard,
just on the brink

11:32.276 --> 11:33.569
between pleasure and pain.

11:33.569 --> 11:36.655
And then that Danish slut Nadia
bursts in...

11:36.655 --> 11:39.616
You can't wait.
His groin will heal

11:39.700 --> 11:41.827
and then before you know it,
you'll be marrying a man

11:41.827 --> 11:44.413
who once ate
a vanilla-scented candle!

11:44.413 --> 11:45.789
That was on me.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.250
I shouldn't have left it
in the kitchen.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.794
Though, it was lit.
Man, he dumb.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.754
The invite goes live
in five minutes.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.922
<i>What?</i>

11:54.006 --> 11:55.883
It goes out automatically
unless I stop it,

11:55.883 --> 11:58.218
and that only happens
if I hear you dump Nick

11:58.302 --> 12:00.554
on speakerphone
before then.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.972
Fine.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.144
Hey, Nick. I'm
sorry about that.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.022
Um, listen,

12:10.022 --> 12:12.316
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

12:12.316 --> 12:16.695
No, Robin, I'm sorry.
I'm like half here.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.780
That phone call, it just...

12:18.864 --> 12:20.824
I got some really bad news.

12:22.034 --> 12:25.370
My doctor did an MRI...

12:25.454 --> 12:28.248
and...

12:28.332 --> 12:32.503
Oh... oh, God.
What... what is it?

12:32.503 --> 12:34.755
My groin injury is worse
than they thought.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.049
I can't play basketball
for weeks.

12:37.049 --> 12:40.177
Thank God. I thought he was
dying or something.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.263
How many weeks?
How many weeks?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.265
Please tell me
it's not a tear

12:45.349 --> 12:46.767
in the iliolumbar ligament.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.478
It's a tear in the
"libioflumflar linament."

12:49.478 --> 12:51.647
If it's a small tear,
he can still make playoffs.

12:51.647 --> 12:52.773
It's a big tear.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.316
He better not be out
for the season.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.527
- I'm out for the season.
- Damn it!

12:56.527 --> 12:58.987
They're going up against The
Number Crunchers without me.

12:59.071 --> 13:02.658
It's an after-work basketball
league for lawyers

13:02.658 --> 13:05.410
and accountants
and architects who sew.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.829
I mean, who takes it
that seriously?

13:07.913 --> 13:12.417
No!

13:13.502 --> 13:16.755
I just hate
letting Coach Eriksen down.

13:16.839 --> 13:20.926
I would follow that man
through the gates of hell!

13:20.926 --> 13:22.427
Winning.

13:22.511 --> 13:26.723
What do we win when we beat
those Number Crunchers

13:26.807 --> 13:28.559
a few short weeks hence?

13:28.559 --> 13:30.394
A game? Sure.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.354
A trophy? Sort of.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.690
We win a $25 gift card
to Bennigan's,

13:34.690 --> 13:37.150
but what is it
that we really win?

13:37.234 --> 13:38.861
The game!

13:38.861 --> 13:39.945
Yes, I said that Nick.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.405
Right.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.323
But we also win

13:43.407 --> 13:44.825
the right to walk tall.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.034
Oh!

13:46.118 --> 13:49.079
- The right to call ourselves champions.
- Yeah.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.747
So we are gonna
go out and we are

13:50.831 --> 13:52.833
gonna wipe the floor
with those accountants!

13:52.833 --> 13:55.961
And afterwards,
we will feast like kings

13:55.961 --> 13:58.922
on Southwest Fajitas
and Cajun shrimp!

13:59.006 --> 14:03.552
And that check, that check will
be marginally less expensive!

14:03.552 --> 14:05.637
Yeah! Yeah!

14:05.721 --> 14:09.683
Now, they're probably gonna have
to pay full price for that meal.

14:10.851 --> 14:14.897
Nick, you are so sweet,
but I just...

14:14.897 --> 14:16.231
Good news is

14:16.315 --> 14:18.192
it doesn't really matter
if it takes my groin pull

14:18.192 --> 14:19.359
a little longer to heal,

14:19.443 --> 14:22.738
so I may as well start
having sex again.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.156
Listening.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.240
Sickening.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.825
Exiting.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.831
- Nick...
- Huh?

14:32.915 --> 14:33.916
I just...

14:33.916 --> 14:37.252
ah... I...

14:37.336 --> 14:38.337
- Hmm?
- Um...

14:38.337 --> 14:39.421
Mm-hmm?

14:39.505 --> 14:42.049
Oh...

14:42.049 --> 14:45.469
What do you think?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.930
I think I am suddenly
in the mood

14:47.930 --> 14:49.431
for something hot.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.142
I see. Sounds like I should
order some cappuccinos.

14:52.226 --> 14:55.145
Don't talk till
tomorrow morning.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.897
She can't go home
with you, Nick.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.358
- Barney?
- Why not?

14:59.358 --> 15:01.735
Because Robin and I are in love.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.160
Barney, what are
you doing here?

15:10.244 --> 15:11.245
Taking care of something

15:11.245 --> 15:12.663
you clearly can't do
on your own.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.082
I'm sorry,
but you and Robin are done.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.583
What? Robin, what is this?

15:16.667 --> 15:19.044
Barney, look, I-I know
what you're doing, okay?

15:19.044 --> 15:20.420
Please stop.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.880
Robin doesn't want
to hurt your feelings

15:21.964 --> 15:23.006
because you're a nice guy,

15:23.090 --> 15:24.132
but she thinks

15:24.216 --> 15:25.759
you're stupid and she hates you.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.719
- You're welcome.
- Stop doing this.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.179
I love her, Nick.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.722
Look, he doesn't
love me.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.099
He's just saying this because he thinks...

15:32.099 --> 15:34.017
I love everything about her,

15:34.101 --> 15:35.769
and I'm not a guy
who says that lightly.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.272
I'm a guy who has faked love
his entire life.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.023
I thought love
was just something

15:40.107 --> 15:41.275
idiots thought they felt,

15:41.275 --> 15:43.527
but this woman has
a hold on my heart

15:43.527 --> 15:45.445
that I could not break
if I wanted to,

15:45.529 --> 15:47.531
and there
have been times

15:47.531 --> 15:49.783
that I wanted to.

15:49.867 --> 15:53.579
It has been overwhelming
and humbling

15:53.579 --> 15:58.292
and even painful at times,
but I could not stop loving her

15:58.292 --> 16:00.043
any more
than I could stop breathing.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.340
I am hopelessly, irretrievably
in love with her.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.303
More than she knows.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.184
Robin,

16:15.184 --> 16:16.560
is this true?

16:18.937 --> 16:21.815
You heard him.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.026
Oh, wow, it feels
like I have

16:24.026 --> 16:27.321
a pulled groin muscle
in my heart.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.156
Nick, I... I'm so sorry.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.450
I just think that maybe...

16:31.450 --> 16:33.243
Pardon me.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.079
But did you just also get
your heart broken?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.582
- Yes.
- I just got

16:38.582 --> 16:42.211
my heart broken, too!

16:42.211 --> 16:45.047
Well, do the...
the two of you...

16:45.047 --> 16:46.882
want to come back
to my place?

16:46.882 --> 16:48.383
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.635
Come on.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.224
<i>Thus concluded
the Autumn of Breakups.</i>

16:55.224 --> 16:56.725
Wow.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.977
Crazy, right?
Yeah,

16:59.061 --> 17:00.646
you know what would be
really crazy?

17:00.646 --> 17:01.730
If all of 'em

17:01.730 --> 17:06.777
got it on... Barney, Robin, Nick,
and those two women,

17:06.777 --> 17:09.530
and you just know
Nadia's watching in the corner

17:09.530 --> 17:10.989
with her pet snake.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.908
Okay, why aren't
you two having sex?

17:12.908 --> 17:14.284
What?

17:14.368 --> 17:15.786
Excuse me?

17:15.786 --> 17:18.372
Lily has been slobbering
over Robin's sex life

17:18.372 --> 17:21.708
like a cartoon hobo watching
a pie cool on a windowsill,

17:21.792 --> 17:22.793
and you...

17:22.793 --> 17:25.546
the only other time you've ever
exercised this seriously

17:25.546 --> 17:27.589
was when Lily had mono
freshman year

17:27.673 --> 17:29.091
and I caught you doing
one-armed push-ups

17:29.091 --> 17:31.802
with your genitals
over a bowl of ice.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.972
So, when did
you stop doing it and why?

17:35.973 --> 17:38.267
It was, you know,

17:38.267 --> 17:40.644
before Marvin was born.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.229
What?
Th-that's insane.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.940
Well, you have to wait a while
after having a kid,

17:44.940 --> 17:47.901
and... and then you're exhausted
from being up all night.

17:47.985 --> 17:51.238
And then this uncanny
phenomenon began.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.261
Wow,

18:14.261 --> 18:15.804
you guys got to fix this.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.639
It's not that easy.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.145
Ted, having a kid
changes things.

18:23.145 --> 18:27.649
You don't have the time
or energy, you're never alone.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.485
Come here.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.820
What are you doing?

18:31.904 --> 18:33.614
Taking Marvin
for a walk

18:33.614 --> 18:36.074
so you guys can
have some privacy.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.826
Oh, Ted, come on,

18:37.910 --> 18:39.703
that's... that's just not
the way that it works.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.414
Yeah, it's not
like we can have sex on cue.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.416
Yeah, I'll give you
guys plenty of time.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.501
Maybe I'll even

18:45.501 --> 18:47.503
swing by the gym, show Marvin

18:47.503 --> 18:49.630
where his Uncle Ted
made "the shot."

18:49.630 --> 18:50.797
If I'm late,

18:50.881 --> 18:52.758
it's 'cause I've been delayed
by autograph seekers.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.803
Oh, forgot Marvin's diaper bag.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.222
Yowza!

18:58.222 --> 19:00.140
Okay.

19:00.224 --> 19:03.477
And the Oscar for Best
Fake Romantic Speech

19:03.477 --> 19:05.562
goes to Barney Stinson.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.731
I'd like to thank all
the ladies over the years

19:07.731 --> 19:09.775
with whom I've practiced
fake romantic speeches

19:09.775 --> 19:11.610
and, of course,
Robin Scherbatsky

19:11.610 --> 19:13.820
for being so
hypnotized by hog

19:13.904 --> 19:15.614
that she needed me
to come and save her.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.908
You know what?
I didn't need your help.

19:17.908 --> 19:21.870
You were this close to ripping
off his misbuttoned shirt

19:21.954 --> 19:24.164
and pulling down his
inside-out underpants.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.585
I'll give you this,
you were pretty convincing.

19:28.669 --> 19:31.338
Hey, tricking good-looking
idiots is kind of my thing.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.173
No.

19:34.633 --> 19:38.136
I mean, you were
really convincing.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.432
Please.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.060
I was bro-ing you out.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.937
I'm just glad
he bought it so quick.

19:46.937 --> 19:50.232
Any longer, I'd have had
to kiss you.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.657
Hello.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.701
<i>Whoo, oh, my God,
Robin, BFF Fun Day!</i>

20:00.701 --> 20:02.160
<i>That's the most
amazing thing ever.</i>

20:02.244 --> 20:04.955
<i>- Like, you totally read my mind...</i>
- Hey, Patrice.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.749
Oh, you got the
invite, great.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.918
Uh, yeah, uh, let
me call you back.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.628
<i>This is so fantastic,
I can't even catch my breath.</i>

20:11.712 --> 20:14.173
Mm-hmm, yeah.
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

20:14.173 --> 20:16.466
You know
what I forgot to do?

20:17.843 --> 20:21.972
<i>Like a fool,
I went and stayed too long</i>

20:21.972 --> 20:25.434
<i>Now I'm wondering
if your love's still strong</i>

20:25.434 --> 20:28.395
<i>Ooh, baby, here I am</i>

20:28.395 --> 20:31.523

Hey, T-Squares.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.781
Well, bad news.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.783
Heard back
from the league office.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.411
My shot is not going to count.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.997
But onwards and upwards, right?

20:46.997 --> 20:49.583
What do you cats want
to rap about, huh?

20:49.583 --> 20:52.503
Listen, Coach... you're great.

20:52.503 --> 20:56.256
And we all really
want to stay friends.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.678
I can change, I can...

21:01.762 --> 21:04.389
come on, we...
we had some good times.

21:04.473 --> 21:07.601
Things have been
weird lately and...

21:07.601 --> 21:10.187
is there another
architect? Just tell me.
