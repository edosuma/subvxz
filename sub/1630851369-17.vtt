A little pressure.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.971
All right, any underlying
medical conditions?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.973
Just the scarring
in my original uterus.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.278
They called it
Asherman's Syndrome.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.845
Is that acquired or genetic?

11:55.889 --> 11:56.890
Acquired.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.500
I can have kids.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.980
Do you know anything about
your donor?

12:00.023 --> 12:02.243
Just it was someone who died.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.548
- Dr. Marcel?
- Yeah?

12:05.246 --> 12:08.075
I'm seeing a severe thickening
of the endometrial stripe.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.467
Well, what does that mean?

12:09.511 --> 12:11.513
The lining of Claire's uterus
is too thick,

12:11.556 --> 12:13.733
causing her
to bleed uncontrollably.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.995
Can you fix it?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
I can't lose this uterus.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.259
Let's give the medicine
some time to work.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.610
And if it doesn't,
can you do another transplant?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.481
First let's send Claire
for a hysteroscopy

12:23.525 --> 12:24.439
to get a closer look.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.527
And then
we'll have a better idea

12:25.570 --> 12:26.876

12:26.920 --> 12:28.356
Okay.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.705
- We'll be right back, okay?
- Yes.

- Mm.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.369
Makes sense
she's having trouble.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.675
A uterus from a cadaver
can be unpredictable.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.243
It's much better to get one
from a living donor.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.549
How bad's the bleeding?

12:47.592 --> 12:49.029
Yeah, pretty heavy.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.204
What do you think?

12:50.247 --> 12:51.553
If she does need
a hysterectomy,

12:51.596 --> 12:52.859
could you do another
transplant?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.512
Yeah, it's certainly
something to consider.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.036
I don't like it.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.081
Prolonged bleeding makes her
a poor surgical candidate.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.475
And I'm not gonna give her
another cadaveric organ.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.433
But she's young
and otherwise healthy.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.044
Maybe it'd be worth
working her up

13:04.087 --> 13:05.480
just to keep our options open.

13:05.523 --> 13:08.004
