Most of these, I don't think
are drawings, back in here.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.364
I don't know how many I got.
More drawings.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.403
But there are a few.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.412
See? And this is what
they wouldn't like,

00:29.696 --> 00:31.369
because you see all this stuff.

00:31.657 --> 00:35.412
Why somebody who is supposed to
be thinking about driving cars

00:35.702 --> 00:37.500
and what they're gonna
do in their life

00:37.788 --> 00:40.041
mes-sing around,
putting-pasting pictures

00:40.332 --> 00:42.585
of random dogs into a notebook?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.628
So, that's why things
are better these days,

00:44.920 --> 00:48.015
because now you can point
anybody to of

00:48.298 --> 00:50.767
on the net,
and they'll say, "hey."

00:51.051 --> 00:53.850
You know, even if your
teacher doesn't know about it,

00:54.137 --> 00:55.423
you can say, "well, I'm a furry."

00:55.430 --> 00:56.750
I like animals
'cause I'm a furry.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.176
I'm in... you know,
I draw this stuff.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.777
It's not because
I'm totally weird.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.439
I just draw this stuff
'cause I'm,

01:03.730 --> 01:04.730
you know, into this group

01:04.982 --> 01:08.327
"and into
this kind of scene."

01:08.610 --> 01:09.782
A lot of double takes,

01:10.070 --> 01:11.731
downtown Pittsburgh,
this weekend, Janelle.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.191
Yeah, there are a lot
of business suits,

01:13.198 --> 01:14.198
and people going to work,

01:14.449 --> 01:16.292
and then, you see
folks like this.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.296
Yes, the of have arrived.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.060
Folks who have never
seen them before,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.208
don't be scared if you see
a six-foot tall raccoon

01:23.458 --> 01:26.507
walking by your window. No, you're
not going crazy, it's just us.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.835
A lot of people might ask,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.635
why is it so popular?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.802
Why is...
what's the draw here?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.140
Everybody loves animals.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.680
Everybody loves costumes.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.099
We are all about creativity.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.269
We are all about imagination.
We are all about dreaming.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.600
This weekend is our chance

01:42.853 --> 01:44.213
to say to the people
of Pittsburgh,

01:44.229 --> 01:47.278
we want to share
our dreams with you.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.477
If somebody comes up and wants
to know what it's about,

01:49.484 --> 01:51.327
tell 'em what it's about.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.239
Cartoon animals, costumes.

01:54.698 --> 01:58.953
Drawing, art, performance.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.544
Creativity, dreaming.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.085
Every single one of you
in here is a creative.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.470
Every one of you is an artist.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.631
We are all dreamers here.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.425
This is a remarkable family,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.640
a unique community.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.021
There is so much
it has to offer,

02:18.305 --> 02:20.228
so many beautiful things.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.610
Don't describe us
by what we are not.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.818
Use positive imagery.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.449
Don't act like
you have something to hide,

02:29.733 --> 02:31.811
('cause quite frankly, I don't
think we have anything Tc) Hide.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.786
This is a magnificent we,

02:34.071 --> 02:37.075
and to me, there is nothing
at all to be ashamed of.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.722
Do you cover

02:53.006 --> 02:55.304
just what furries do
that's furry

02:55.592 --> 02:57.435
that people don't see
in the background?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.563
Or what if they're into,
like, sports cars,

03:00.847 --> 03:03.191
or you know,
fast cars or whatever...

03:03.475 --> 03:06.149
what other activities...
like, anything?

03:06.436 --> 03:09.861
Or are you trying to keep it mainly
to the fur scene, do you think?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.617
We're trying to go beyond
the scene as well,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.869
because it's
portraits of people,

03:15.153 --> 03:16.780
ultimately,
it's more about even people

03:17.072 --> 03:19.291
than it is about furries,
'cause we're all just people,

03:19.574 --> 03:21.952
just from different backgrounds,
into different stuff, so-

03:22.244 --> 03:25.498
definitely, any tangents
that goes on is where we go.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.895
I have called myself a furry,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.231
but I never really understood it

03:47.519 --> 03:49.738
until I was about 17 years old.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.614
I went to work as a mascot

03:51.898 --> 03:53.400
for a single-a baseball team,

03:53.692 --> 03:55.410
surprisingly, as a raccoon.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.493
And the first time I got in
that suit and that mascot

03:58.780 --> 04:01.283
was just completely surreal.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.875
I mean, Will was gone.
I mean, he was gone.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.539
I didn't know
who he was anymore,

04:06.830 --> 04:08.423
and I was performing
in this character,

04:08.707 --> 04:11.051
and I just felt nobody could
see me, nobody knew who I was,

04:11.334 --> 04:13.928
so I could be
as energetic, as happy,

04:14.212 --> 04:16.714
as crazy as I could be,
and people loved it.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.367
And after that
first time I did it,

04:18.507 --> 04:20.510
I really felt,
it's like-

04:20.802 --> 04:22.804
this is what it feels like.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.271
This one, as you can see,
is totally different.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.441
And it's different because it's
made by a different suit-maker.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.492
Any suit-maker has
their own different style,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.987
this was specifically
was made by Cody.

04:38.278 --> 04:43.660
He kind of has more of a cartoony
kind of look, more energetic look,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.499
and that's what
I wanted to go for

04:46.787 --> 04:50.508
and why I commissioned him
to make Diezel 2.0.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.418
I try to be
as creative as I can,

04:52.709 --> 04:55.303
and a lot of people come up to
me every time and say to me,

04:55.587 --> 04:57.589
"man, there's not
many raccoons in the fandom.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.849
Your suit is, like,
the best one I've ever seen."

05:00.133 --> 05:01.293
And of course, I'm just like,

05:01.384 --> 05:03.227
"stop, come on.
You're making me blush."

05:03.512 --> 05:06.356
Of course, I am blushing
inside when they say that.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.314
But, you know,
and I try to add-

05:09.601 --> 05:11.103
you know, like,
I squeak-talk a lot,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.613
and that's one thing
a lot of people view me for.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.915
It's all of...
it's kind of like a brand,

05:17.025 --> 05:18.197
really, is what it is.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.863
Everybody tries to find
their own unique style

05:21.154 --> 05:22.246
on what they do.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.874
They try to bring it to life,

05:24.157 --> 05:27.627
and that's what people
can get to know you for.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.414
You know, they'll hear me
squeak-talking,

05:30.705 --> 05:32.116
but they'll be out of view,
and they're like,

05:32.123 --> 05:33.921
"oh, my god, I hear Diezel. Is
he here?"

05:34.209 --> 05:35.756
And sure enough, it's me.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.222
Everybody has a unique story.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.136
The more and more
you get involved,

05:44.427 --> 05:47.021
you'll see that it is so easy
to get to meet people,

05:47.305 --> 05:48.397
who they are specifically,

05:48.682 --> 05:51.356
and how...
who's behind that character.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.923
I mean, who's behind
that fursona

05:52.978 --> 05:54.651
or that pursuit,
if they have one.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.445
All right.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.785
DOM, if you will...

06:05.073 --> 06:09.078
This little part ends up being on
the inside when you flip it over.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.873
When I first started,
very few people had a suit.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.088
Only if you had tons of money
did you have one,

06:16.376 --> 06:20.381
and only if you were really
hardcore furry did you have one.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.892
It's almost a rite of passage,
if you will,

06:24.175 --> 06:25.472
for people to get a suit,

06:25.760 --> 06:28.980
'cause it really lets them
put on their persona,

06:29.264 --> 06:31.483
live it, and do what
they wanna do,

06:31.766 --> 06:35.487
and see themselves
how they wanna be seen.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.634
Because I wanted to be able
to hear some stuff,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.671
that's why the other one
is not floppy,

07:00.962 --> 07:03.590
but it means a lot to me

07:03.882 --> 07:06.556
to be able to even do this,

07:06.843 --> 07:09.938
and to be able to walk around

07:10.221 --> 07:13.270
and be something different,

07:13.558 --> 07:18.815
and something that
I wanted to do.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.700
So, it's important that I'm
even able to do this for you,

07:22.984 --> 07:27.205
and show you
my floppy ear of cuteness.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.129
Have you ever
come out here in these woods,

07:31.326 --> 07:32.828
like, with your pursuit before?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.666
This is a first.

07:34.955 --> 07:39.802
I've been in the woods,
but not these woods.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.258
This Will be interesting.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.298
They said that
there was hunters around,

07:45.590 --> 07:46.967
to be honest, I've gotta say,

07:47.258 --> 07:50.182
they're probably not gonna
shoot a six-foot tall fox,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.938
but you never know.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.566
It may be a short season.

07:54.849 --> 07:55.896
Maybe they need a trophy.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.814
And, come on, this is a trophy.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.699
Oh, my back.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.856
I would say that I'm very rare.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.821
I'm not the norm.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.951
Yeah, you do see a lot of guys,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.829
and a lot of times,
when I say I'm a mother,

08:50.113 --> 08:51.615
people are like,
"whoa, really?',"

08:51.906 --> 08:54.125
like it's taboo or something
to be a mother,

08:54.409 --> 08:56.161
and I don't think
that's the case at all.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.822
I think it's really
awesome to have kids.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.909
I think it's really awesome

08:59.080 --> 09:01.833
to have kids exposed
to furry fandom.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.423
It's just a great experience
for them, too.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.929
All right, there you go.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.809
You guys
have a lot of fun, okay?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.439
I don't think it'll
be confusing for her at all,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.980
I actually think
it's something that she might

09:23.271 --> 09:25.319
actually be interested in
when she's older.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.656
I've already seen her...
she likes animals a lot.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.493
She likes to wear Halloween
costumes that are animals.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.159
And that's just so cool

09:35.450 --> 09:37.794
to have that experience
with her, too,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.796
and see her grow up like that.

09:43.708 --> 09:47.963
My fursona is basically
to memorialize my dog.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.884
He was bouncy and fun
and loving.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.645
And I guess whenever
I'm wearing bandit,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.523
I'm a little him.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.730
I could say
it's opposite my life,

10:01.017 --> 10:04.612
because I'm a pretty
laid back guy out of suit.

10:04.896 --> 10:09.743
And I get in suit
and I get party-fun,

10:10.026 --> 10:13.371
if that's a word.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.040
This guy down here
cutting a tree down.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.672
You said your neighbors...

10:30.964 --> 10:32.500
what were you saying
about your neighbors,

10:32.507 --> 10:33.747
that they knew about your suit?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.969
Oh, my next door neighbors,

10:36.261 --> 10:37.387
they knew about the suit,

10:37.679 --> 10:40.057
and their grandchildren
were over one day.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.022
I put bandit on
and I walked over,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.687
and they just loved it.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.028
What's the color that's
underneath there on the arms?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.363
- What?
- You have the color on the arms.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.780
Oh, that's the rainbow flag.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.200
If I turn my arms up...

10:58.491 --> 11:01.244
It's in the correct order.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.538
Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, purple.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.550
It angers me when I
find people that say,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.091
"oh, all you do
is dress up in those suits,"

11:14.382 --> 11:16.851
and party and carry on

11:17.135 --> 11:19.763
and have sex in them suits,"
and all that.

11:21.806 --> 11:26.528
If you've ever
had vigorous sex naked,

11:26.811 --> 11:28.438
you know how much you sweat.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.404
Can you imagine doing that
in a full pursuit?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.659
You would die.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.664
It can quickly get over
100 degrees inside the head.

11:37.947 --> 11:42.623
So, no, that's...
that's a false statement

11:42.911 --> 11:46.165
to even think
that that's all it does.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.881
Yes, there's sex
that happens in the fandom.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.341
I remember
when I was in my twenties-

11:52.629 --> 11:54.723
okay.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.977
But, uh, sex...

11:59.260 --> 12:04.608
the fursona fandom thing
is, um...

12:06.351 --> 12:09.230
I think it's about
helping other people

12:09.520 --> 12:11.022
to put a smile on people's face,

12:11.314 --> 12:13.316
and let them,
even for a few minutes,

12:13.608 --> 12:16.487
forget about the real world
and all the troubles.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.582
<i>Jâ we don't even have to try I</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:23.334
âŞ it's always a good time âŞ

12:23.618 --> 12:27.464
âŞ Whoa, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh âŞ

12:27.747 --> 12:29.920
âŞ Whoa, oh, oh,
it's always a good time I

12:30.208 --> 12:31.786
A lot of furry conventions
have dance competitions

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
'cause there's
a big dancer community

12:34.087 --> 12:35.885
in the furry fandom.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.641
It's different than I would say,
like, a normal competition.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.553
Because here
no one cares who wins.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.437
Everyone supports everyone

12:43.721 --> 12:46.190
and it's just a big family,
which is what I love.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.074
And a lot of times,
I know that I've gone

12:48.101 --> 12:49.603
to meet people at a convention

12:49.894 --> 12:51.305
and then we'll all just
go to lunch together

12:51.312 --> 12:53.064
after meeting each other
for 10 minutes,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.324
and that's how you make friends.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.270
Jâ do our thing, do our thing I

13:04.450 --> 13:08.296
Jâ and the wonder girls
are back âŞ

13:19.382 --> 13:20.884
âŞ Watching âŞ

13:21.175 --> 13:23.644
Jâ 'cause you've got me
patiently waiting jâ

13:23.928 --> 13:25.601
<i>jâ I think you're amazing,
baby I</i>

13:25.888 --> 13:28.266
âŞ it's okay,
you're worth the wait I

13:28.558 --> 13:31.232
âŞ but I just can't no more âŞ

13:31.519 --> 13:35.069
Jâ dreaming of you every night,
and I'm praying âŞ

13:35.356 --> 13:36.699
âŞ Will you hold me tight âŞ

13:36.983 --> 13:40.032
Jâ and just wrap those arms
around me, boy? âŞ

13:40.320 --> 13:43.494
Jâ I really wanna feel
you in my soul jâ

13:43.781 --> 13:45.408
<i>I never really
told anyone about it,</i>

13:45.700 --> 13:47.668
it was just kind of
something I did.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.796
But then my friend
discovered it by himself,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.923
and then, he, like...

13:53.207 --> 13:54.550
he kept saying all these things,

13:54.834 --> 13:57.087
mentioning fursuits
and anthrocon and stuff.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.658
His name is Jake,
and I was like,

13:58.796 --> 13:59.843
"Jake, are you a furry?"

14:00.131 --> 14:02.099
And he was like,
"I don't think so."

14:02.383 --> 14:04.932
And I was like, "you talk about
fur suits and blah, blah, blah."

14:05.219 --> 14:06.505
And he was like,
"well, maybe I am."

14:06.512 --> 14:07.764
And I was like,
"I am, too!"

14:08.056 --> 14:09.603
So, that was kind of cool.

14:26.741 --> 14:27.958
Boomer the dog

14:28.242 --> 14:30.586
out in the middle
of the woods right now.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.713
And he can hear
the wind in the trees

14:32.997 --> 14:35.671
on a nice fall day,
the day before Halloween.

14:38.086 --> 14:42.091
And I just got back yesterday

14:42.382 --> 14:44.134
from the final sections
of the appeal,

14:44.425 --> 14:47.804
getting it into the court.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.643
So, hopefully,
we're gonna do well,

14:49.931 --> 14:51.774
and the judges are gonna
have to get back to me

14:52.058 --> 14:56.939
on whether I can get the name
"boomer the dog" or not.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.198
So, we'll see.
I mean, it is my name.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.572
It's always been my name,
for many years.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.037
And I believe in the spirit

15:09.325 --> 15:11.453
of what "here's boomer"
was all about-

15:11.744 --> 15:13.792
you know, the TV show.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.378
I mean, I love that show.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.010
See, I didn't see every
episode of "here's boomer,"

15:19.293 --> 15:22.263
but the show went off the air,

15:22.547 --> 15:26.222
and then after that,
I kind of was-I was sad,

15:26.509 --> 15:27.709
because I really liked the dog

15:27.969 --> 15:30.597
and I liked the show.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.858
And I thought, well...

15:34.142 --> 15:35.519
What am I gonna do?

15:35.810 --> 15:38.563
How do I keep this spirit alive?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.232
Because it's so good to me,

15:40.523 --> 15:43.447
just at this right time
in my life.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.408
How do I keep this going?

15:54.036 --> 15:57.836
Okay, and here's...
this is how I do it.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.467
And I always have a shirt on.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.252
And a lot of furries-

16:01.544 --> 16:04.343
a lot of costumers will
work with a shirt on

16:04.630 --> 16:06.473
'cause it absorbs sweat,

16:06.757 --> 16:08.680
so it doesn't actually go
into their costume.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.891
I mean, there are a lot
of manufacturing methods.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.728
I just have the benefit of
clothes, and that's it.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.894
So, I just use this
as a covering,

16:17.185 --> 16:19.279
and sometimes
you'll have fine satin

16:19.562 --> 16:21.235
or mesh under a lot of costumes.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.069
But I just did it cheap,

16:23.357 --> 16:27.157
like, seven dollars
to make the whole thing,

16:27.445 --> 16:28.662
and all of that was for paper,

16:28.946 --> 16:32.041
'cause I just used
old clothes that I had.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.544
So, there's my paw shoes.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.250
I mean, I think
for a lot of furs,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.961
it's a weekend
release sort of thing,

16:40.249 --> 16:42.343
and then others,
it's a lifestyle

16:42.627 --> 16:44.800
where you have it
around you all the time,

16:45.087 --> 16:46.680
and kind of think in that mode.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.513
'Cause I like to
think like I'm a dog,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.393
and I'm looking out at the world

16:51.677 --> 16:55.352
with canine-type eyes
and seeing things that way.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.360
I could change my name,
but it's pretty wild

16:57.642 --> 16:59.895
to change my name to "boomer,"
or "boomer the dog."

17:00.186 --> 17:02.564
How could I go
through this process?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.949
I went down to the courthouse,

17:05.233 --> 17:07.656
got the paperwork,

17:07.944 --> 17:09.320
filled it out,
and got-

17:09.612 --> 17:12.707
they had to do fingerprints
and get those taken.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.709
And then I submitted,

17:15.992 --> 17:17.336
and I went to court,

17:17.619 --> 17:18.872
and I lost my case.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.415
And then also he said,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.334
"even though the petitioner"

17:23.626 --> 17:25.502
may wish it were otherwise,

17:25.795 --> 17:27.888
"the petitioner
is not a dog."

17:28.172 --> 17:32.018
That was the final words
in that document.

17:34.262 --> 17:38.187
My friend actually
told me about the people,

17:38.474 --> 17:40.772
you know, that there were
furry people on the computer.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.939
(And they said they're into
the kind of drawings you DC)

17:44.230 --> 17:45.652
And stuff like that.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.318
And he says, "but I think
they're mostly foxes."

17:48.609 --> 17:50.361
But they weren't actually,
you know?

17:50.653 --> 17:51.950
And I was like,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.036
"wow, I have to get
the Internet right away."

18:10.673 --> 18:12.175
So, then I found them,
and I was like,

18:12.466 --> 18:14.764
"wow, there's other people
like me-â others like me."

18:19.557 --> 18:20.917
You shouldn't
be asking who we are.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.356
You should ask who we were.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.444
We... we...
we were the fat kid.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.860
We were the brainy kid.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.323
We were the bookish kid,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.291
we were the kid with
the big thick glasses.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.416
We were the kid concerned
about his sexual identity.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.499
We were the kid who
couldn't throw a baseball.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.624
We were the kid,
who for whatever reason,

18:40.911 --> 18:44.381
all the other kids said,
"you don't belong with us."

18:44.665 --> 18:49.171
Now, human beings as social
animals, crave companionship.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.681
And denied companionship
by our peers,

18:51.964 --> 18:54.433
we sought it out the next
best place we could find it.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.890
Some of us look to the stars,

18:57.178 --> 19:00.773
others to the far past
of human history.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.607
We looked to the happy, smiling,

19:04.894 --> 19:09.616
accepting faces that we saw
on Saturday morning cartoons.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.278
Now, to answer your question,
"who are we?"

19:13.569 --> 19:18.450
We are adults who never
forgot our old friends.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.256
Hello, everybody.
I am Diezel raccoon,

19:33.547 --> 19:36.050
here at McDonald's
across the street

19:36.342 --> 19:38.015
from one of the best
ever conventions-

19:38.302 --> 19:39.849
furry connection north.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.390
Uh, I'm partially drunk, I know.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.777
I don't know about the public
intoxication laws here,

19:46.060 --> 19:48.279
whatever the fuck
you wanna call it.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.564
I can say that
furry connection north 2013

19:50.856 --> 19:53.234
Will be my last convention
for a little while.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.497
(I had Tc) Make some life
changes with my career.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.908
I'm going to a different
shift, different job.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.076
It was for the best.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.745
My life comes first.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.709
Furry does come second.

20:05.996 --> 20:09.045
So, I mean, I won't
be doing a con every month.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.131
I'll be doing one
every so often.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.887
I'm gonna try as hard as I can

20:13.170 --> 20:14.638
to attend as many as I can,

20:14.922 --> 20:18.677
because all of you out there
are my friends...

20:18.968 --> 20:21.721
the people
that see these videos,

20:22.012 --> 20:26.688
uh, my friends
that watch the videos,

20:26.976 --> 20:28.102
just everybody.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.237
You all are big family to me,

20:30.521 --> 20:32.865
and that's why I go
to conventions.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.402
<i>How can I
move back in with those people?</i>

20:35.693 --> 20:36.740
Please, tell me.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.950
They're insane.
You know that.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.162
[Jerry Seinfeld on I TV hey, my parents
are just as crazy as your parents.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.209
This is what I think
people perceive it as.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.720
They perceive it as...

20:55.004 --> 20:56.347
some folks may perceive it as,

20:56.630 --> 20:58.553
"this is how they live it
day to day,"

20:58.841 --> 21:00.343
yeah, I come in my house,

21:00.634 --> 21:01.851
I put my fursuit head on,

21:02.136 --> 21:04.639
and I literally live
this way all my life.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.728
I go over here and make dinner

21:07.016 --> 21:08.768
on my 400-degree stove,

21:09.059 --> 21:10.732
I mop the floors,

21:11.020 --> 21:14.274
I clean the refrigerator...
all with this on.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.533
My ass.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.576
Remember how mommy
wears this sometimes?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.369
You like when mommy
wears her, huh?

21:26.660 --> 21:30.710
'Cause you can play with her?

21:34.001 --> 21:37.596
Um, is mommy going to wear this?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.598
Yep.

21:39.882 --> 21:40.804
It's a lot of fun, huh?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.171
Do you wanna wear it again?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.182
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.596
Here.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.238
It's hard, isn't it?

21:57.817 --> 22:00.411
- Can you see?
- Mm-hmm.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.823
Okay. It's tough to see
through that, isn't it?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.410
Ah!

22:08.702 --> 22:09.624
Hey!

22:11.831 --> 22:12.627
Hey!

22:29.640 --> 22:31.017
You know,
I've been married before.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.310
My ex-husband
was not a furry,

22:33.602 --> 22:39.450
and that kind of made things
really hard sometimes

22:39.733 --> 22:42.031
because he just didn't
get the fandom at all

22:42.319 --> 22:43.662
and I was really into it.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.449
And, you know,
he just-

22:46.740 --> 22:48.020
I think that's
part of the reason

22:48.200 --> 22:49.918
why we ended up
separating-

22:50.202 --> 22:51.545
part of the big reason why.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.048
Um, and, you know,

22:54.331 --> 22:55.958
I think that
I would still love Ryan

22:56.250 --> 22:58.594
if he weren't a furry,

22:58.878 --> 23:01.097
but because he is, it
just makes the experience

23:01.380 --> 23:05.476
so much better for both of us.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.056
I saw her for the first time,

23:07.344 --> 23:09.024
and she was this, tiny,
little, unimposing,

23:09.179 --> 23:10.681
cute, you know...

23:10.973 --> 23:12.520
she almost looked like
the human form

23:12.808 --> 23:13.808
of a plushy or something.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.253
I just wanted to hug her,
you know?

23:15.311 --> 23:16.911
And she came up to me
and she did hug me,

23:17.021 --> 23:18.022
and it was just...

23:18.314 --> 23:19.634
she was so forward
and so natural,

23:19.815 --> 23:21.988
and it really did
just feel right.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.823
- Porcupine.
- Porcupine.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.829
Porcupines sleeping

23:26.113 --> 23:27.911
Porcupines sleeping.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.707
I love how she makes
the little noises

23:31.994 --> 23:33.371
like we do with the animals.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.585
Here.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.500
Here. Don't...

23:37.791 --> 23:39.543
don't let them jump on you.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.553
Part of my family is native,

23:45.841 --> 23:48.310
and in our culture,

23:48.594 --> 23:49.720
there are spirit animals...

23:50.012 --> 23:53.061
having phantom ears,
phantom tail, you know?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.852
Having dreams about being feral,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.237
having dreams about, you know,

23:58.520 --> 24:00.057
just romping through the
woods, kind of thing,

24:00.064 --> 24:03.568
and I've definitely
always felt that way.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.578
Even when I was a young
child, I felt that way.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.739
I mean, we have a friend who,

24:09.031 --> 24:12.205
um, you know,
he wants to be an elf.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.245
Like, literally,
that's his life,

24:14.536 --> 24:17.961
and he wears elf ears
all the time.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.744
He wore prosthetic ears to a session
of congress, I think it was?

24:20.751 --> 24:23.095
Yeah, I mean, that's just,

24:23.379 --> 24:26.553
and we're all like,
more power to you.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.683
- It's great.
- If you want to do that-

24:28.968 --> 24:31.096
he's one of
the greatest guys we know.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.230
He's just, you know, wonderful,

24:33.514 --> 24:35.187
and he really thinks
he should be an elf.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.566
Yeah, and it's good,

24:36.850 --> 24:38.261
because people like that
often are so nice,

24:38.268 --> 24:39.986
because they're
they're true to themselves.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.443
- You have to be true to yourself.
- Yeah, absolutely.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.359
It's hard, the way we're primed
to interact with society,

24:45.651 --> 24:46.994
and, like I said,
filter yourself

24:47.277 --> 24:50.372
it's beaten into you
from almost the time

24:50.656 --> 24:53.375
you're aware
of your surroundings.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.582
It looks like
a house in Greentree.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.917
But it's actually
a radio station.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.880
And you might confuse this for
some kite string caught in a tree,

25:02.167 --> 25:04.261
but it's really an antenna
leading from the house

25:04.545 --> 25:06.764
specially elevated
for signal strength.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.501
Did you climb that tree in order
to get it all the way up there?

25:09.508 --> 25:12.853
Nope, just took a bow and
arrow and shot it up.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.229
And this gentleman,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.936
he's 22-year-old
Gary Mathews,

25:17.224 --> 25:18.897
vice president
and general manager

25:19.184 --> 25:22.108
of radio station WKND,

25:22.396 --> 25:25.900
a small pirate station
Gary put on the air himself.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.411
<i>N</i>

25:29.695 --> 25:30.912
Funkadelic...

25:31.196 --> 25:35.576
Right here at 1620 WKND.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.370
You know,
I'm just a radio freak...

25:37.661 --> 25:38.833
a radio animal.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.561
That's what my name
says right there.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.833
<i>N</i>

25:43.125 --> 25:44.627
yeah, I'm not gonna
start barking yet,

25:44.918 --> 25:46.716
but since it's close.

25:47.004 --> 25:50.224
All right, let me see
the listeners are doing.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.850
Check my stats.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.851
There's six people
already listening.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.647
<i>âŞ Testing 1, 2, 3 âŞ</i>

26:00.934 --> 26:02.732
This is just a loop.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.772
And it goes...
repeats over and over,

26:05.064 --> 26:07.317
and it kinda builds tension
or suspense maybe.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.612
<i>âŞ Testing 1, 2, 3 âŞ</i>

26:10.903 --> 26:12.871
This is
the Barenaked ladies-

26:13.155 --> 26:14.077
beginning of the song,

26:14.364 --> 26:16.082
I think it's
"testing 1, 2, 3."

26:16.366 --> 26:17.663
<i>âŞ Testing 1, 2, 3 âŞ</i>

26:17.951 --> 26:19.203
And it just repeats.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.749
Other stations don't do
stuff like this,

26:23.040 --> 26:25.384
so we do it.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.511
I just played music
and I barked on the air,

26:28.796 --> 26:30.093
and I was a dog.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.633
And this was at a time
when I was having trouble

26:32.925 --> 26:35.929
with a lot of people
in my life about being a dog,

26:36.220 --> 26:38.700
because it was like-it was
interfering with things supposedly,

26:38.931 --> 26:40.774
and getting a career.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.026
That was a really strong
push at that time

26:43.310 --> 26:45.187
by everybody around me,

26:45.479 --> 26:47.481
so, I felt since
they were saying,

26:47.773 --> 26:49.491
"you can't.
You just can't be a dog."

26:49.775 --> 26:51.948
They would tell me all the time

26:52.236 --> 26:53.829
"dogs don't go to jobs,"

26:54.113 --> 26:58.664
or "you're hardcore
unemployable like this."

26:58.951 --> 27:00.794
I was trying to do it,

27:01.078 --> 27:03.080
and I was, you know,
being pushed back,

27:03.372 --> 27:06.125
and one of the places
I could actually go

27:06.416 --> 27:10.011
and be a dog and let it out
was on the radio.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.719
My mom signed it with
a "G" name back then-

27:17.010 --> 27:18.478
1982.

27:18.762 --> 27:22.608
And then we go way back
to me as a young pup.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.011
And I don't know what I have

27:24.226 --> 27:26.274
that I'm holding and showing,

27:26.562 --> 27:28.564
but that's me as a young pup

27:28.856 --> 27:30.950
in 1968, November.

27:31.233 --> 27:35.409
I was about three years
old right there.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.243
This one...

27:37.531 --> 27:40.535
this has where my mom
signed the back of the picture

27:40.826 --> 27:42.169
on her own free will...

27:42.452 --> 27:44.329
she signed it "boomer."

27:44.621 --> 27:46.965
That's 1998 there.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.002
I did have my family here,

27:50.294 --> 27:54.174
and I lived with my family
till I was almost 40 years old.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.341
A family is like giving...

27:56.633 --> 27:59.978
or having a mate is like giving

28:00.262 --> 28:03.061
yourself to one person,
more or less.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.191
That part of you

28:05.475 --> 28:09.070
is wrapped up
in your love for your mate.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.857
And I feel like I'd like
to give the friendship

28:12.149 --> 28:16.370
out to a wider group,
people who'll-

28:16.653 --> 28:18.371
make them happy by being a dog,

28:18.655 --> 28:21.124
showing them that you can have
a different lifestyle,

28:21.408 --> 28:23.911
and a different outlook,
and things like that.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.204
So, I'm kind of in a role

28:25.495 --> 28:26.792
of maybe putting that out there,

28:27.080 --> 28:29.503
teaching that it's possible.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.919
I kind of think
that's my role in life,

28:32.211 --> 28:35.841
rather than just
making one person happy

28:36.131 --> 28:37.599
or a small group.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.806
I'd like to spread it around.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.858
I made the mistake
of talking about it

28:47.142 --> 28:50.692
in my old facility I came from.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.609
It started off by...

28:54.900 --> 28:56.311
Kind of introducing it
to my managers.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.896
They would always ask,
"where do you go every month?

28:57.903 --> 28:58.904
What do you do?"

28:59.196 --> 29:01.164
And I had a good
relationship with them

29:01.448 --> 29:02.825
and they didn't harass me

29:03.116 --> 29:06.245
or gang up on me in any way.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.323
They actually were kind of
intrigued by it a little bit.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.048
They kind of tossed
jokes around.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.834
They say jokes like,

29:12.125 --> 29:14.005
"why don't you become
a porcupine or something?"

29:14.127 --> 29:16.004
I don't want to.
A raccoon is like-

29:16.296 --> 29:17.616
"well, a porcupine
would be funny.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.307
You'd be the first one"
I'm like, no.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.935
So, then I thought to myself,

29:22.219 --> 29:24.938
maybe I'll share it with a
couple (lo-workers that I trust.

29:25.222 --> 29:29.352
But understand that
in the work environment,

29:29.643 --> 29:32.271
don't place too much
trust in people,

29:32.562 --> 29:34.682
even the people that you think
you can trust the most,

29:34.856 --> 29:36.483
because eventually
people do talk.

29:36.775 --> 29:41.656
Something you don't want
to be let out or told?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.915
Don't say anything at all.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.746
Well, I did,

29:46.034 --> 29:50.380
and it got out to some
of the wrong folks.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.144
They started looking
at things online,

29:52.374 --> 29:54.092
searching the name,

29:54.376 --> 29:56.595
finding stuff, finding artwork,

29:56.878 --> 30:00.007
um, finding journals.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.848
Um, eventually got
to the point where

30:03.135 --> 30:04.055
comments would be said.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.850
I kinda rolled it off.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.685
Things would be written about me

30:07.973 --> 30:10.692
on the bathroom stalls
and in these freight elevators

30:10.976 --> 30:13.104
on the walls there
in permanent marker.

30:13.395 --> 30:16.490
Um, so, it wasn't
a fun experience.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.367
So the simple answer of how I keep
it separate from my work life

30:19.651 --> 30:22.200
is I don't talk about it.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.114
I think it goes to show

30:24.406 --> 30:28.001
that people really
aren't ready for that stuff.

30:28.285 --> 30:31.380
The fandom, as you can see,
if very accepting.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.634
People in general,

30:35.917 --> 30:38.511
they accept what they think
is the norm.

30:38.795 --> 30:42.095
What is the norm?
I don't know what it is.

30:44.301 --> 30:45.928
Not really my place to say.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.018
What feels normal to me
may not be normal to you.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.906
We're just
trying to get together

30:58.190 --> 31:00.909
and let our hair down and have
some fun for the weekend.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.538
We're not doing it to be
entertainment fodder for you.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.164
That's not what we're here for.

31:06.448 --> 31:10.203
These people don't want
to have to hide in their rooms

31:10.494 --> 31:12.292
because you're going
to destroy their lives.

31:15.499 --> 31:16.842
See, and that's
the kind of thing,

31:17.125 --> 31:19.753
not everybody gets
to break the barrier either.

31:20.045 --> 31:23.390
Maybe it's their approach
or something.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.223
I mean, you guys seem
to understand what it's about

31:27.511 --> 31:31.391
and why furries would want
to be private and public.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.399
And I'm glad you did this study

31:33.683 --> 31:36.812
because sometimes producers
come on strong, I think,

31:37.104 --> 31:38.606
to the community,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.991
and they've, like,
alienated people.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.821
And maybe it's
the wrong kind of media

31:43.110 --> 31:44.862
or something like that,

31:45.153 --> 31:47.622
but you guys
have the understanding

31:47.906 --> 31:51.001
of what, you know,
the furry scene is like more.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.004
So, I think you can connect
a little better,

31:53.078 --> 31:54.295
and that's good.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.298
Yeah, I just feel like
other things about it,

31:57.582 --> 31:59.244
they're trying to give
you an answer for it

31:59.251 --> 32:01.162
and trying to make it
really simple and cut and dry

32:01.169 --> 32:02.872
so that way, you don't
have to think about it anymore.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.290
But for me it's like,
the more people you meet

32:04.297 --> 32:05.337
the more interesting it is

32:05.590 --> 32:07.558
'cause there's
no one answer and stuff.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.561
Yeah, that's-â wow.
It's great.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.392
I'm really happy
about "fursonas."

32:11.680 --> 32:14.229
I hope I see...
I get to see it,

32:14.516 --> 32:16.393
you know, in its full glory
and all that.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.025
Take one.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.236
This is a picture
of me and my friends.

32:25.527 --> 32:29.828
That's me and my boyfriend,
obviously.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.715
Someone would have
to be really accepting

32:31.741 --> 32:34.620
if they weren't a furry
for me to date them.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.231
And it's definitely
a lot more fun

32:36.329 --> 32:37.907
to date someone, I think,
who is a furry,

32:37.914 --> 32:39.576
because then you can go
to conventions together

32:39.583 --> 32:41.301
and do things like that.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.758
I don't understand
where the correlation is

32:44.045 --> 32:46.173
between, like, making an
animal character for yourself

32:46.465 --> 32:47.808
and liking men.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.434
I don't...
I don't understand

32:49.718 --> 32:51.265
where that comes from.

32:51.553 --> 32:54.056
People have told me that

32:54.347 --> 32:57.692
Tc create an animal
character for yourself,

32:57.976 --> 33:01.901
you have to
appreciate cuteness more

33:02.189 --> 33:06.740
than, I don't...
maybe, I don't know,

33:07.027 --> 33:10.156
more than like a blatantly
straight man would be like.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.495
"I'm gonna make a
little puppy character of myself."

33:12.782 --> 33:15.285
I don't think that would happen.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.500
But, I mean, I don't know.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.084
I think about that often.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.500
I don't understand
where that comes into play.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.510
I feel like 80%
of furries are males,

33:24.794 --> 33:26.888
and then 80%
of those males are gay,

33:27.172 --> 33:28.094
and I don't know why.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.542
And then the other ones are bi.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.669
Like, no one...
I don't know.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.518
Oh, you.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.152
<i>N</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:00.963
you want to know my theory

34:01.248 --> 34:05.503
on why there was
an uprising of furries

34:05.794 --> 34:07.717
through the late '90s,
early 2000s?

34:08.004 --> 34:08.755
Yes.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.766
Okay, so, you were saying

34:12.050 --> 34:13.266
there was a lot of furries

34:13.552 --> 34:16.351
that joined the community
around the 20005...

34:16.638 --> 34:18.356
late '90s, early 2000s,

34:18.639 --> 34:22.565
and the reason for that
possibly stems from the fact-

34:22.851 --> 34:23.978
uh, two reasons.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.399
One is that
a Disney movie came out.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.614
"The lion king" came out
in 1995, I believe?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.527
I want to say 1993.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.572
- 1994.
- It came out-1994.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.366
- Split the difference. -"The
lion king" came out in 1994.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.587
Ha! Pinned ya.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.871
And that proved to be
an extremely popular film.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.585
Especially in the furry world,

34:44.873 --> 34:47.422
that became a very popular film.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.179
At the turn of the millennium,

34:49.462 --> 34:51.590
basically you had
all these people

34:51.880 --> 34:53.882
who grew up knowing
these very iconic

34:54.175 --> 34:56.393
Disney anthropomorphic movies

34:56.678 --> 34:58.680
as well as getting
very involved in the Internet.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.270
Yeah, and I think
world communication

35:01.558 --> 35:04.903
allowed the globalization
of furry.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.405
<i>N</i>

35:08.940 --> 35:11.944
all right, if they
wanna get-

35:12.235 --> 35:13.828
they wanna get a fox on film

35:14.112 --> 35:17.116
smoking some...
smoking some ganja.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.546
Yeah!

35:27.208 --> 35:29.631
It's people in action,
if you think about it.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.013
Because we're part
of this fandom

35:32.297 --> 35:33.799
that is so accepting.

35:34.090 --> 35:37.219
And we accept
transsexuals and gays

35:37.510 --> 35:41.435
and people that
can't talk to anybody else,

35:41.723 --> 35:43.225
and all these crazy things.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.644
But if you show furries
what I'm about to do,

35:45.935 --> 35:48.358
more than 70%
of them would be like...

35:57.864 --> 36:00.663
However, the ones that
we have met that do smoke

36:00.950 --> 36:02.827
tend to be the most accepting
out of all of 'em

36:03.119 --> 36:05.213
and the coolest and easiest
to get along with.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.216
They kind of can see things
a little bit more

36:08.500 --> 36:12.300
for the reality
rather than the spectacle.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.554
Whoo!

36:26.976 --> 36:27.818
Shit.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.496
âŞ âŞ

36:46.788 --> 36:49.132
I don't know
who that border collie is.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.884
That's a bad suit.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.213
âŞ Santa baby âŞ

36:58.925 --> 37:01.223
âŞ Light blue âŞ

37:01.511 --> 37:04.060
âŞ I'll wait up
for you, dear I

37:04.347 --> 37:06.475
âŞ Santa baby âŞ

37:06.766 --> 37:08.689
Right there.

37:08.977 --> 37:12.106
This is Garador.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.320
I don't know who the otter is.

37:14.607 --> 37:18.783
Jâ think of all
the fun I've missed âŞ

37:19.070 --> 37:21.619
- This is Brody. -.Lâ think
of all the fellas jâ

37:21.906 --> 37:24.659
âŞ that I haven't kissed âŞ

37:24.951 --> 37:27.500
His name on F.A.
Is "Wooley."

37:27.787 --> 37:29.664
W-o-o-l-e-y.

37:29.956 --> 37:35.087
âŞ If you check off
my Christmas list jâ

37:35.378 --> 37:36.095
Is there anybody

37:36.379 --> 37:37.623
that you think
we should talk to?

37:37.630 --> 37:39.177
Other suiters or furries?

37:43.970 --> 37:46.348
I would say uncle Kage.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.822
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Sam Conway.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.630
I'm known in this fandom
as uncle Kage.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.231
I'm the chairman
of this organization.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.775
I want to thank
each and every one of you

38:03.782 --> 38:05.329
for being here tonight.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.793
I've got
a professional reputation

38:11.080 --> 38:12.377
that I have to maintain.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.168
I am a well-known
public figure

38:15.460 --> 38:17.633
in my hometown
of Malvern, Pennsylvania.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.173
I am a borough official,

38:19.464 --> 38:21.091
I am a scientist,

38:21.382 --> 38:23.305
I am...

38:23.593 --> 38:26.517
I am somebody that is
what some people would call

38:26.805 --> 38:28.182
a pillar of the community.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.397
He loves the fandom.
He loves all of us.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.028
He portrays us very well,

38:34.312 --> 38:36.690
he's just very good
with his words,

38:36.981 --> 38:38.858
uses the right words,

38:39.150 --> 38:41.278
is very cautious about

38:41.569 --> 38:44.914
what he says, who he says it to,

38:45.198 --> 38:49.374
to what media outlet
may be trying to get in

38:49.661 --> 38:51.959
and try to film us
or film anthrocon.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.247
He's very protective of it,
which I highly respect.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.411
We have had a few black eyes

39:30.702 --> 39:32.625
given to us by the media.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.461
We've had some very,
very good reporting,

39:35.748 --> 39:38.467
and we've had some reporting
that, shall we say,

39:38.751 --> 39:41.049
focused on aspects of the fandom

39:41.337 --> 39:43.214
that we really try to minimize.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.062
"We understand that furries

39:57.353 --> 40:00.072
have been treated unfairly
by the media, but we..."

40:01.691 --> 40:03.318
Uh-huh. Yeah.

40:03.610 --> 40:09.333
I have probably
600 emails in my archive

40:09.616 --> 40:11.744
that all have
that phrase in 'em,

40:12.035 --> 40:13.127
and they're all lying.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.732
When we were
at anthrocon, as you know,

40:35.016 --> 40:37.986
we got into some trouble
because we're the media.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.749
Can you tell me about
the relationship

40:40.021 --> 40:41.819
of furries to the media?

40:42.106 --> 40:46.657
Um, it's not very good
for two reasons.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.666
One, the media oftentimes

40:50.949 --> 40:53.077
over-exaggerates things,

40:53.368 --> 40:54.745
and I guess you could
say in a way

40:55.036 --> 40:56.754
they maybe make some stuff up

40:57.038 --> 40:58.991
and dig into things that
really shouldn't be dug into.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.547
They care more so about
their ratings

41:01.834 --> 41:04.929
than the truth.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.307
You have people
who are, you know,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.137
they've heard the stereotypes

41:09.425 --> 41:12.554
or they're apprehensive
about people in fur suits,

41:12.845 --> 41:15.769
and, you know,
a lot of people thinking

41:16.057 --> 41:17.934
it's a sexual thing
when it's not.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.571
Furries are just
into sexual acts.

41:21.854 --> 41:25.404
They do it inside of
their fursuits.

41:25.692 --> 41:28.036
They're a bunch of perverts.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.196
The list goes on,

41:30.488 --> 41:33.583
and it's absolutely not true.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.585
How much of a part of the fandom

41:36.869 --> 41:38.792
is sexual for you?

41:39.080 --> 41:42.380
Well, that I...

41:42.667 --> 41:44.010
that I probably
really won't say,

41:44.293 --> 41:45.454
because I feel
that that's something

41:45.461 --> 41:48.010
that's personal to myself

41:48.297 --> 41:50.015
and to whomever it may be.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.633
If your back is to the wall

43:13.925 --> 43:15.142
and you got no better answer,

43:15.426 --> 43:16.769
play dumb.

43:17.053 --> 43:18.173
That's always worked for me,

43:18.221 --> 43:19.939
and I'm real good at it.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.436
What is this all about?

43:25.728 --> 43:27.071
Nothing.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.073
That's a lie.
They know that.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.906
What are you hiding?
What don't you want us to see?

43:32.193 --> 43:34.193
What is going on here?
What's really going on here?

44:07.228 --> 44:08.354
I mean, okay,

44:08.646 --> 44:10.006
there are some people
in the fandom

44:10.189 --> 44:14.535
that they're just known
for their sexual aspects,

44:14.819 --> 44:16.821
their porn of their character
and things like that,

44:17.113 --> 44:19.115
and I don't want
to be anywhere near that.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.159
I want people to know me for me

44:21.450 --> 44:23.919
and not what my character
looks like naked.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.080
You can't talk about
the furry community

44:26.372 --> 44:29.342
without talking
about sexual things.

44:29.625 --> 44:33.346
I mean, the two go
basically hand in hand.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.974
It's not so overt,
not everybody's into it,

44:37.258 --> 44:40.979
but it's certainly a very large
presence in the community,

44:41.262 --> 44:46.769
and to say that there is not
that presence would be remiss.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.232
I mean, it's obviously there

44:49.520 --> 44:50.772
and it's obviously a big part.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.986
I don't really look
at erotic art.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.197
I see it online

44:55.484 --> 44:57.782
and I know that
is a big part of the fandom,

44:58.070 --> 45:00.198
but it's not something
I actually look at.

45:00.489 --> 45:03.208
And on furry affinity,
I have the kid filter on.

45:03.492 --> 45:04.994
I never specified age.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.584
I don't even see
the adult stuff on it.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.192
Where's the best place
to look at,

45:09.415 --> 45:11.088
- you or the camera? Okay.
- At me.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.299
So, my name's Varka.
My real name's Jan.

45:14.587 --> 45:18.637
I am a cocksmith by trade.

45:18.925 --> 45:22.020
I work for Bad dragon,

45:22.303 --> 45:25.523
and Bad dragon makes
fantasy-themed toys.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.780
The human condition
of where we're at

45:33.064 --> 45:36.238
in terms of accepting
adult things in our lives

45:36.525 --> 45:37.993
is kind of depressing.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.746
I hate to say it,
but particularly in America,

45:41.030 --> 45:44.000
this was stuff that was
the foundation of religion.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.411
It was stuff to do with

45:46.702 --> 45:49.672
what is the socially-accepted
norm, right?

45:49.956 --> 45:51.833
What are things that are,
you know,

45:52.124 --> 45:53.592
that are considered good or bad?

45:53.876 --> 45:55.378
And I don't think masturbation

45:55.670 --> 45:58.048
should ever be an acceptable
dinner table conversation ever

45:58.339 --> 46:00.637
because everybody
should have standards.

46:00.925 --> 46:03.128
And I think that's something
very important to emphasize,

46:03.135 --> 46:05.058
is any community
needs standards,

46:05.346 --> 46:08.566
and there needs to be certain
topics that are not on the table.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.567
But at the same time,

46:10.851 --> 46:14.401
I feel that people should be
comfortable enough with themselves

46:14.689 --> 46:17.238
and with their close-knit
group of friends

46:17.525 --> 46:20.153
to be able to be honest
with themselves

46:20.444 --> 46:21.741
about what they really want.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.532
What we've got is...
it's called a come tube.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.747
And so what you do
is you have this stuff

46:27.034 --> 46:28.862
which looks like come,
and you put it in a syringe,

46:28.869 --> 46:30.997
and you run it, and you
squirt it down the tube,

46:31.289 --> 46:33.007
and it comes out the end.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.634
Just a tube down the middle.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.670
This is one we found
in fantasy-themed fan-fiction

46:37.962 --> 46:39.305
and furry porn and stuff,

46:39.588 --> 46:42.467
the jizz always looks
like this stuff does.

46:42.758 --> 46:44.556
It's always everywhere, right?

46:44.844 --> 46:47.563
And we were like, "oh, if
we're doing fantasy toys",

46:47.847 --> 46:49.394
let's make fantasy lube
to go with it,

46:49.682 --> 46:51.229
'cause lube is expensive.

46:51.517 --> 46:52.970
If you go and buy it
from the pharmacy.

46:52.977 --> 46:55.856
It's six bucks
for a tube, right?

46:56.147 --> 46:58.070
And it doesn't work
very well with toys

46:58.357 --> 46:59.779
because it goes away a lot.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.240
It's designed for sex,
it's not designed for,

47:02.528 --> 47:04.246
you know, your own use.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.248
And so we made this stuff

47:06.532 --> 47:09.661
which we called come lube

47:09.952 --> 47:13.957
because it's
your idealized fantasy...

47:15.708 --> 47:17.802
Fantasy come.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.009
And it's all stringy,

47:21.297 --> 47:22.594
and it's white tinted,

47:22.882 --> 47:24.225
and it makes a huge mess.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.636
But it's...
I think it's hot.

47:26.927 --> 47:28.349
In the right context,

47:28.637 --> 47:30.105
I think this stuff's amazing.

47:43.152 --> 47:47.953
I have worked very,
very, very hard

47:48.240 --> 47:52.416
to foster good relationships
with the local media

47:52.703 --> 47:55.422
and with the city of Pittsburgh.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.629
The city of Pittsburgh loves us.

47:57.917 --> 47:59.840
The media likes us.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.595
I want to keep it that way.

49:01.313 --> 49:02.280
A Pittsburgh man,

49:02.565 --> 49:03.737
we're gonna start with him.

49:04.024 --> 49:07.244
He believes his spirit
is more dog than human.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.871
Take a look at this guy.

49:09.155 --> 49:10.372
That's why he wanted

49:10.656 --> 49:12.401
to legally change his name
to boomer the dog.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.661
But a judge won't
let him change his name.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.296
These are my puppy ears
right here.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.799
And I have a dog tag.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.632
Do you consider
yourself what's called a furry?

49:23.919 --> 49:25.045
I do.

49:25.337 --> 49:27.760
I feel that
I'm a dog by default,

49:28.048 --> 49:31.973
but furry is the scene
that I'm in.

49:32.261 --> 49:35.481
I found it after I
discovered that I was a dog.

50:23.312 --> 50:25.314
Oh, well, I love the media.

50:25.606 --> 50:28.325
I'm in the media in my own way

50:28.609 --> 50:30.111
with my little radio station

50:30.402 --> 50:32.746
and podcasts
and stuff like that.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.748
I really do like cameras.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.751
I like to be on the other
side of the camera,

50:38.035 --> 50:39.537
the lens side of the camera,

50:39.828 --> 50:43.583
and to just do productions
of any kind.

50:43.874 --> 50:46.468
I really like media,
just all in general.

50:46.752 --> 50:48.470
I've been holding it in
for a long time,

50:48.754 --> 50:50.472
you know, being canine.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.259
It was something
I was put down for

50:53.551 --> 50:55.679
back in my early days.

50:55.970 --> 50:58.723
When I first started out,
people didn't get it.

50:59.014 --> 50:59.981
So, I like to do media,

51:00.266 --> 51:01.786
and I kind of feel like
it's an answer,

51:02.017 --> 51:05.146
some of this,
to what people said,

51:05.437 --> 51:07.155
or they didn't want me
to do this stuff,

51:07.439 --> 51:09.079
or thought it wouldn't
amount to anything.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.576
And it's kind oe like,

51:10.859 --> 51:13.112
I'd like the people
in my school to see this,

51:13.404 --> 51:14.781
and my teachers and everything,

51:15.072 --> 51:19.498
to see the media and,
yes, I'm still out there.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.708
Oh, god.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.919
He made his suit
out of shredded paper.

51:24.206 --> 51:26.334
- Mm-hmm.
- And he was on "Dr. Phil."

51:26.625 --> 51:27.968
Oh, god.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.380
What a bad representation
of the furry community.

51:30.671 --> 51:33.800
So are a lot of
furries upset about that?

51:34.091 --> 51:36.640
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, when it first aired,

51:36.927 --> 51:39.055
oh, my god.
F.A. Just blew up.

51:41.974 --> 51:43.692
It was unbelievable.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.320
Anyone who's outside
the fandom looking in,

51:46.604 --> 51:48.527
and they see
a person like boomer

51:48.814 --> 51:51.158
and they say, "oh,
what the heck is he doing?"

51:51.442 --> 51:55.197
And a group of furs,
who naturally should be

51:55.487 --> 51:56.727
accepting people to begin with,

51:56.989 --> 51:58.616
are like, "oh, boomer."

51:58.907 --> 52:01.147
And I just don't think that
should be the way that it is.

52:01.327 --> 52:02.920
I think, you know,

52:03.203 --> 52:05.126
like, look at yourself.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.963
I mean, you're the one...
you're dressing up in a suit.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.594
You're running around town
and barking.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.097
How are you any different
than boomer is?

52:13.380 --> 52:15.724
You're always gonna have
a small portion of folks

52:16.008 --> 52:18.727
that stand out
in a negative way,

52:19.011 --> 52:20.729
especially to the media.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.937
I just personally felt that

52:24.224 --> 52:26.147
that was possibly one individual

52:26.435 --> 52:29.154
that didn't really represent

52:29.438 --> 52:32.112
the true meaning of the fandom.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.652
I mean, what makes his opinion

52:34.943 --> 52:36.445
more valuable than boomer's?

52:36.737 --> 52:40.833
Sure, and there are things
that Diezel likes

52:41.116 --> 52:43.244
that other people
consider to be,

52:43.535 --> 52:45.663
you know, taboo,

52:45.954 --> 52:48.503
or not a good representation
of the community.

52:48.791 --> 52:50.509
So, we each have our own things

52:50.793 --> 52:52.511
that we like and don't like.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.513
However, it's all part
of one community

52:54.797 --> 52:57.266
and you should talk to everybody

52:57.549 --> 52:58.721
to get the extremes of it.

52:59.009 --> 53:02.559
I do think that boomer
is one extreme,

53:02.846 --> 53:04.189
and I think that we are another.

53:04.473 --> 53:07.192
You know,
we are much unlike boomer,

53:07.476 --> 53:09.478
and even Diezel...

53:09.770 --> 53:11.147
but two sides of the same coin.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.940
Boomer is a little,

53:13.232 --> 53:14.434
I mean,
I don't want to say that.

53:14.441 --> 53:17.285
That sounds so bad,
but he-

53:17.569 --> 53:19.412
yeah, I mean, his fursuit's
made out of paper

53:19.697 --> 53:21.415
and it's a little sketchy,

53:21.699 --> 53:23.246
and he tried to change his name.

53:23.534 --> 53:24.694
And I am not about that life.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.833
âŞ All my love âŞ

53:32.042 --> 53:34.761
See, there it is.

53:35.045 --> 53:37.343
Listen to my monitor.
From the A.M., there's delay.

53:37.631 --> 53:40.305
There's a lot of delay in this.

53:40.592 --> 53:42.094
âŞ What am I supposed to do âŞ

53:42.386 --> 53:43.888
âŞ What am I supposed to do âŞ

53:44.179 --> 53:45.522
âŞ What am I supposed to do âŞ

53:45.806 --> 53:48.229
âŞ What am I supposed to do âŞ

53:48.517 --> 53:50.144
Isn't that weird?
That's through A.M.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.609
It's going... 'cause there's
delay through everything.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.115
It's streaming down there and...

53:55.399 --> 53:56.651
âŞ what can I do for you âŞ

53:56.942 --> 53:58.660
âŞ What can I do for you âŞ

53:58.944 --> 54:01.288
A lot of the times
on TV shows-

54:01.572 --> 54:02.915
like, it's been on "Tyra banks"

54:03.198 --> 54:04.916
and it's been on...

54:05.200 --> 54:06.747
Lots of shows,

54:07.035 --> 54:10.539
and they bring in
that type of...

54:10.831 --> 54:12.879
Bad, like, typical furry.

54:13.167 --> 54:14.767
Or they might just
tell 'em to ham it up.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.295
I don't know what happens.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.557
But they always end up
saying not good things

54:19.840 --> 54:21.387
and making everyone else
look bad.

54:27.347 --> 54:28.439
Okay.

54:29.892 --> 54:33.112
Tell me about what a furry does.

54:33.395 --> 54:35.113
Well, we are furries.

54:35.397 --> 54:37.525
Furries are people

54:37.816 --> 54:41.616
who have an inner animal
that they like to celebrate.

54:41.904 --> 54:43.451
- Okay.
- And we celebrate it

54:43.739 --> 54:47.539
through drawing ourselves
and wearing costumes.

54:47.826 --> 54:49.703
Do you have sex
when you have the costume on?

54:49.995 --> 54:51.338
Yes.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.169
And I've heard that that person,

54:57.461 --> 54:58.587
I don't know who it is,

54:58.879 --> 55:00.597
but, like, people don't
talk to her anymore

55:00.881 --> 55:02.000
and she feels bad or something,

55:02.007 --> 55:04.009
but I don't know how it went.

55:04.301 --> 55:05.928
I haven't looked up
on it, so-

55:06.220 --> 55:07.563
oh!

55:09.223 --> 55:11.317
Did you really?
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.726
Shit.

55:15.479 --> 55:18.779
This bitch
so crunchy right here.

55:21.068 --> 55:22.866
Oh, wait a minute.
Hey, how's it going?

55:23.153 --> 55:25.497
- I know, right?
- I just realized.

55:25.781 --> 55:28.330
- Takes a while.
- I was like, "cl-l, wait a minute."

55:28.617 --> 55:31.587
I've got, like, my little
missiles targeting it.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.213
Fuck it!
You caught me!

55:34.832 --> 55:37.176
Jesus.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.120
"I don't know really
what to say about chew fox"

55:39.127 --> 55:40.288
that hasn't already been said.

55:40.295 --> 55:42.673
Suffice to say, she...

55:42.965 --> 55:46.890
she sold out the fandom
for her own personal gain.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.020
She got her 15 minutes
on national TV

55:49.304 --> 55:51.932
by showing herself
to be the very kind of person

55:52.224 --> 55:54.318
"we all like to pretend
doesn't exist."

55:54.601 --> 55:56.361
And that's that point
you were talking about.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.740
Everyone likes to pretend
that it doesn't exist at all.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.742
Like, no, it doesn't
happen at all.

56:03.026 --> 56:06.656
And that's just
a wretched way to think.

56:06.947 --> 56:09.200
"She did it by
taking a collective shit"

56:09.491 --> 56:11.414
on the rest of us
for a few dollars- âŞ

56:11.702 --> 56:12.828
Which I didn't make...

56:13.120 --> 56:15.043
"and her moment
in the limelight."

56:15.330 --> 56:16.456
I was less embarrassed

56:16.748 --> 56:19.251
over the Alan panda
pedophilia issue

56:19.543 --> 56:20.669
"than I am this shit."

56:20.961 --> 56:22.053
Isn't that, like...

56:22.337 --> 56:23.930
I am more insulting
than a pedophile.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.932
I'm more insulting than someone

56:26.216 --> 56:28.890
who was found sexually
assaulting children.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.929
I am more offensive than that.

56:37.477 --> 56:38.899
See? "Great.
Just what we need."

56:39.187 --> 56:40.689
We were almost forgotten."

56:42.482 --> 56:43.722
So, what?
This is something that

56:43.984 --> 56:47.488
we have to feel ashamed
about, apparently.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.281
There will be people
who will hate you

56:49.573 --> 56:51.166
for this documentary.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.293
There will be people
who will dislike me,

56:53.577 --> 56:57.081
and you, and anyone
involved in this project.

56:57.372 --> 57:02.253
One of the best pieces of
artwork I saw in my honor

57:02.544 --> 57:03.921
was a picture
of someone holding me

57:04.212 --> 57:06.260
by the scruff of my shirt,

57:06.548 --> 57:09.722
and all it said was,
"You told."

57:11.637 --> 57:12.684
That says it.

57:12.971 --> 57:14.251
That's all
that needs to be said.

57:14.389 --> 57:15.732
It's not what we say,

57:16.016 --> 57:17.518
it's that we said it at all.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.366
You guys might wanna get
a picture of this one.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.590
More interesting sex
partners when we come back.

57:40.874 --> 57:42.474
We'll be right back.
We'll keep guessing.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.719
Oh. "Uncle Kage's furries
in the media" next.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.349
- Look at that.
- Don't.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.180
Suggested?

57:51.468 --> 57:55.564
Suggested to play
immediately afterwards.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.815
Let me guess,
it's probably about me.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.980
So, reporters would come to me and
they would say, "Will you talk to us?"

58:01.269 --> 58:03.442
I'd say,
"I'd rather not. No."

58:03.730 --> 58:05.858
So, they would go and find
someone who would.

58:08.193 --> 58:10.821
Well, we can go on and on
with many examples.

58:11.113 --> 58:12.313
I'm not going to name names...

58:12.447 --> 58:13.369
Like chew fox.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.785
I'm not gonna name that name...

58:16.076 --> 58:17.953
Little fucking bitch.

58:18.245 --> 58:19.963
He just uses diversion tactics.

58:20.247 --> 58:22.591
He knows... he knows
how to manipulate

58:22.874 --> 58:24.376
a conversation in his favor.

58:24.668 --> 58:27.012
And that is a very
valuable skill,

58:27.295 --> 58:29.593
and that's probably a skill
I don't necessarily have.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.007
Maybe a little.
I don't know.

58:31.299 --> 58:33.427
But I don't like that approach.

58:33.719 --> 58:35.437
I'm gonna be up front with you,

58:35.721 --> 58:38.065
I think fursuits
can be very attractive.

58:38.348 --> 58:42.023
I would still have sex
with someone in a fursuit.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.187
I prefer to have sex
with someone in a fursuit

58:44.479 --> 58:46.902
than to be in suit...
it's very hot.

58:47.190 --> 58:49.284
Um, you know, really hot.

58:49.568 --> 58:50.615
When we went on the show,

58:50.902 --> 58:52.825
they kind of lied to us
to get in there,

58:53.113 --> 58:54.410
but that's what
a lot of them do.

58:54.698 --> 58:58.373
They said hype up the story
and make it real.

58:58.660 --> 59:01.209
So, they said,
"hey, you're gonna be paired"

59:01.496 --> 59:04.215
with these two other peopl...
these two other couples,

59:04.499 --> 59:09.505
and you guys are gonna be the people
who have sex in their fursuits.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.514
And we're like,
"we don't do that."

59:11.798 --> 59:13.516
"No, but we want you
to say you do that."

59:13.800 --> 59:15.473
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- But I don't do that.</i>

59:15.761 --> 59:17.213
- Well, the thing...
- no, we haven't.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.938
- We did a little bit.
- No, we didn't.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.145
- Little bit.
- No.

59:21.433 --> 59:25.233
Anyways, um, so...

59:25.520 --> 59:26.646
At that time, we just said,

59:26.938 --> 59:27.978
"you know what?
Forget it."

59:28.148 --> 59:29.365
Let's just go on there

59:29.649 --> 59:31.369
"and try to portray it
the best way we can."

59:31.610 --> 59:32.987
And it totally backfired.

59:33.278 --> 59:36.202
And looking back at it,
we shouldn't have done it,

59:36.490 --> 59:38.242
but hindsight is 20/20.

59:38.533 --> 59:39.659
What's done is done.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.669
As I've told him,
I don't regret it.

59:41.953 --> 59:43.500
I don't.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.325
I don't think we personally
did anything that wrong.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.675
And what I had
told them yesterday

59:46.958 --> 59:49.837
is that anything
that I said-

59:50.128 --> 59:52.256
the first question
was directed at the fandom.

59:52.547 --> 59:53.541
"What is the furry fandom?"

59:53.548 --> 59:54.674
And I answered that.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.606
But any question
that was asked after that

59:56.760 --> 59:58.933
was purely about
what goes on between us.

59:59.221 --> 01:00:02.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah, really.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.031
I think furries tend
to become very defensive

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:12.113
if they feel attacked,
regardless of the situation.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.119
It's very common for one person

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.531
to say something,
and then a group...

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:19.700
a mob Will just form
and attack that person.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.585
Which isn't good, but...

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:26.715
<i>N</i>

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.409
There's a really
interesting dichotomy,

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:29.696
I think, in the furry community,

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.055
because on one hand,
you have a lot of people

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.091
who... they're comfortable
with themselves,

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.002
they're comfortable
with their interests, right?

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.103
And to each other,
it's accepted and understood-

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:41.764
well understood.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.400
And then whenever
media gets involved,

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:46.936
everyone's terrified.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.524
Everyone is terrified.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.156
And I think
it's a mistake for furries

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:55.239
to try and hide behind,

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.355
"oh, I don't want anything
to do with the media

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:00.707
because they might expose me
to be a pervert."

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.709
Everybody's a pervert
in some way.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.336
The real question is

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.899
what is the intent of the person

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.756
that's looking to do
the expose, right?

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.168
You need to be sensible.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.757
But also along
the lines of, you know,

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.725
what does it say about you
if you're afraid

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:19.343
to stand up for what
you believe in, right?

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.558
And I think it's...

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.065
that's part of the reason
why I'm doing this interview,

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.271
is because I think that, um,

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.106
the furry fandom
has a long way to go

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.772
in terms of accepting itself.

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.986
Do you know who Varka is?

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:36.368
He's the CEO of Bad dragon.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:39.154
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.789
So you've heard of Bad dragon?

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.798
Unfortunately, Bad dragon

01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:52.960
has been taken away
from anthrocon.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.471
It used to be an actual store.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:02:01.101
They had things covered
so that minors couldn't view.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.011
However, they were taken away

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:06.728
because uncle Kage wanted
nothing to do with that.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:09.359
So, that was
uncle Kage's decision

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.943
to boot Varka and Bad dragon.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.624
Okay, you can mute it.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.038
He's right.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.844
- What was that?
- I said he's right.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.721
It does take years
to build a reputation

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.303
and ten seconds to destroy it.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.310
People would not be
totally accepting

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.268
of the full truth.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:49.273
It's like a white lie.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.855
You're telling them
part of the truth,

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.771
so that they'll understand it,

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.407
but they don't need
to know everything.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:01.867
If something really bad happened

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:07.284
and it was exploited
by the media to the public,

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:11.296
do you think that families
would bring their children

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.879
to the Westin hotel lobby

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.510
to get hugs from furries?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.138
No.

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.702
Right now,
my daughters too young

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.970
to understand any
of the porn side of it.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:29.105
Obviously, we don't show
her that kind of stuff.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:33.690
And when she's old enough
to make her own decision,

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.479
she can decide
whether she thinks

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.397
that it's okay or not okay.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.612
But we're going to raise her

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.618
as this is perfectly acceptable

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:45.325
and that everyone
is their own person

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:48.241
and you should accept people
for who they are.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.128
<i>Did I say that out loud?
I'm terribly sorry.</i>

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:53.572
I'm very, very...
I apologize.

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.068
It is the wine,
I blame the wine.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.966
They put something in it...
alcohol.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.877
That's all.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.889
<i>I really didn't
know I was doing this panel,</i>

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.631
- hon est.
- Wow.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.142
<i>I feel like
even politicians, though,</i>

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.549
- that's what bothers me.
- I never heard a politician

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:13.934
call someone a fucking bitch.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.569
I mean, okay,

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.981
maybe in the privacy
of their own home,

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:23.402
but I've never blatantly heard
someone on camera say that.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.822
If you have
a reputation to preserve,

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.662
don't call people
"fucking bitches."

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.748
That's really sad.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.754
I don't know, I mean,

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:38.167
that you have to be that
insecure about yourself

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.553
to call someone out like that.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.342
- Kato, get over here.
- What's up'?

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.181
Okay, so any of that-

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:52.188
do you feel like that's
surprising to you in any way?

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.772
You're free to judge me,
but I agreed with 85% of it.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.403
And with the maybe 15% left,

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.814
content-wise,
only 5 of it.

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:02.934
Most of it's just in the way
you say something.

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:05.021
A politician should never
get caught saying his mind.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.573
But, I mean, aside from that,

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:10.286
I don't really disagree
with what he's got to say.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.201
<i>I think it's a difficult...</i>

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:15.791
I don't know, it's...
do you-

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.119
fuck, dude, really?
Really?

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.688
You don't like
that there are people

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:19.993
who are gonna agree with it.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.586
But, I mean, I don't know,

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:25.221
it just doesn't seem
that hyperbolic to me.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:26.927
The way in which
he says it, sure,

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:29.809
but I do think most people
are too inept

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.562
to articulate
their own standpoints,

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.816
let alone someone else's,
or a group's identity.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:39.444
So, yeah, I think
that the guy who is

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:41.604
most able to do so
probably should.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.068
But, you guys, you know,

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:44.767
I've been working on this
for three years.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.374
You guys have been
communicating with me.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:49.037
You guys are people who
know how to speak English.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.243
Right, and I guess that's
what I would caution.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.891
I mean, not to sound
condescending,

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:55.074
'cause I'm not here to tell
you how to do your job.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.042
But, I guess, make sure
that you spend more time

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.729
bringing to light those voices
who can articulate themselves,

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.369
rather than bringing down someone
who attempts to do it for them

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.424
even if, perhaps, not in a
way that you approve of.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:07.331
I don't know, maybe a lot
of furries are stupid.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.541
Maybe we're the only smart ones.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:09.549
I don't know.
I don't-

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.127
it's not that
they're stupid, I think.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.454
I just think that
they're just not

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.637
held to a high enough
standard of behavior.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:18.229
They don't think about their
conduct in a larger sense,

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.553
and I think that's what Kage's
trying to impose on people.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.346
Whether or not he's going
to be successful at that,

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.447
whether or not he can be
successful at that,

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.903
that's up for debate.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:28.285
But I think that people
do need to think about

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.286
how they are perceived
by other people.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:34.416
It's an important part
of personal responsibility.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.667
And I think as soon
as someone like Kage gets up

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.669
and says, "be this, be this",

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.500
not this, and do this,"

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.961
it takes anything valid in
the fandom that we've done

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.672
and just flushes it
right down the toilet.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.133
Because if we are
all about acceptance,

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.675
if we all are
about individuality,

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.515
who's to say that
he can say that to anybody

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.242
and that people should
listen to him?

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:58.515
I think it's common knowledge

01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:01.685
over people who have
the Internet and cable-

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.104
everyone's like,
"oh, yeah, furries."

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.523
They dress up as animals
and have sex with each other,

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:08.726
"or they go in the woods
and have sex with animals,"

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:12.533
or things like that,
and then they move on.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.020
But then the furries are like,

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:17.121
"no, we cannot
let this happen!"

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:18.250
It already happened.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.536
You can't change it back.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:21.750
Like, so...

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.915
Do you worry that
if you say the wrong thing

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.926
that you're gonna get
in trouble with furries?

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.555
Do I worry a little bit?

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.340
Sure.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.350
But I've made
the conscious decision

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.728
to step in front
of this camera right here

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:40.561
and speak my mind on it.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.408
Could there be
some repercussions of it?

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:43.939
Sure.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.355
At the end of the day,
I've still got my friends

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:49.365
and that's all
that matters to me.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.572
I'm not out here
to defame anybody.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:54.237
I'm not out here to throw
the fandom under the bus.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.952
I'm not out to change the world.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.583
I'm not out
to change the fandom.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.914
I'm just out there to be me.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.530
Once again, I'm going to
reiterate this point

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.585
because it is very important.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:06.169
You're not representing you,

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.175
you're representing all of us.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:09.756
I think what he's getting at

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.718
is when you decide to get
in front of a camera,

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.179
you're not representing
just you at that time.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.594
You're representing the fandom.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:18.761
And I think, again,

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.395
a lot of people try to do that,

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.059
but they don't say it
in the right way.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:25.602
Is that tough for when

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:27.611
you feel like
your only responsibility

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.988
should just be to be you, right,

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.268
instead of somebody who
just got into an interview?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.620
Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes
sense to what he's saying

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.951
at this point in time right now.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.207
I'm not just representing me,

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:44.792
I'm representing the fandom.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.627
The people that like him,
do they actually like him?

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.212
Because now I'm a little...

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.870
sort of the way
your interview went,

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.580
it was, like, not that
you were supporting him,

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.009
but at first
you didn't necessarily

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.640
want to speak too ill of him.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.800
So, I almost wonder
if it's maybe because

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.685
they feel like
they have to support him,

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.643
or at least not be detractors,

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.773
or if they genuinely like him.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:08.437
Basically, he's got
connections to the other...

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.651
the other higher...

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.032
if you would even
call them higher up furs,

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:16.240
as in dragoneer
who runs fur affinity

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.807
and some of the other web sites.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.265
And I think
there's a general fear

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.830
that his cronies
or his followers

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.528
are going to
beat the shit out of you

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:27.037
because you spoke ill of Kage,

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.673
when I think the reality is

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:32.881
he thinks he speaks
for the masses,

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.968
and I just think
he speaks for some.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.475
And I think a lot of people
won't talk ill of that

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.261
because they don't
want to be shown

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:42.952
as someone who's
against the fandom,

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.439
and some people think
if you don't agree with Kage,

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.725
you're against the fandom.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.270
I feel you're a little biased

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.438
in your interviewing.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.482
Just a little bit.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.276
Poquito.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.864
<i>Well, I mean, it's like...</i>

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.950
where's the other...
where's Kage's side?

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.707
Fucking, I would love it.
I would love that side.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.082
You can't get Kage's side

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.040
without Kage's approval
on Kage's edit.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:07.920
Didn't he deny doing this?

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.922
Yeah, he said...

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.422
sure, yeah.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.091
A lot of other communities

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.305
don't really have
the same problems

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.720
that the furry community does.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.451
But I feel that a lot
of the problems

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.314
that the furry community has

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.647
are brought on
by themselves-

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:34.155
mainly trying to spin
themselves in a good light

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.112
when it not necessarily is.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.618
I'm not saying that things
are bad or wrong

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.118
with the furry community,

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:44.749
but they are certainly not
portrayed real.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:47.831
It's just what
they want you to see,

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:49.666
and that comes off...

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.752
people take that
and spin that even.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:54.838
- So...
- It's an unnecessary cover-up.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.343
If you just let things be,

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.129
it might be a Niger place.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:02.301
People might actually accept
furries for who they are.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.392
And here's the thing, too,
let me add to that,

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.353
and why he...

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.731
I believe he tries
to help the fandom

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.358
and here's one reason why.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:13.941
What is the age majority
in the fandom?

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.150
It's very young.
It's a very young fandom.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:22.321
As I get older, the fandom
continues to stay young

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.785
and get younger.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:28.952
A lot of young people
in this generation,

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:31.166
they don't always
know what to say.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:35.834
They're very stubborn.
They have a lot of pride.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.924
They don't think about
the repercussions of things,

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:42.933
and you have to be careful
with people like that.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.607
So, uncle Kage's
doing a "winestream,"

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:56.521
which is a livestream.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.191
If you're unfamiliar
with what that is,

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.200
it's just him
at his computer at his house

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.533
taking questions for hours
and getting drunk.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:07.991
Is this controlling these?

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.829
<i>You don't hear an echo?
I don't care.</i>

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:10.993
I have an idea.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.780
For those of you
who say you hear an echo,

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.915
fuck you! Okay, now!

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:19.006
We're getting going because
I've not been able to drink

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:22.012
while Jack has been screwing
around with the damn server!

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.639
Now it's my turn.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.550
- So!
- Shit.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.586
I'd like to welcome you all
to the winestream.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:28.845
I apologize.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.548
We had a very,
very lovely intro set up,

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:31.852
but, oh, well.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:32.856
Maybe next time.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.268
I apologize,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.234
I don't like
north Carolina wines.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.865
It's a lovely state, and I'm
sure they make lovely wines,

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.445
but they're not to my taste,

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.270
I prefer Columbia valley,
Washington state,

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.245
or Mosel valley of Germany.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.031
Um, Dominic.
"Do we really need

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.042
the anthrocon media policy
to be so strict?"

01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:52.660
Fuck, yes!

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:55.046
Um, okay, cook away.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:57.673
"The elevators will hold up.
What about the escalators?"

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:01.461
- One thing at a time.
- One, two, now.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.971
Somebody asked me a
question, it went away.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.053
I'm gonna start at the bottom.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.684
"Do you ever feel you're going
too far calling furries out

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.963
that screw up in the media, like
boomer the dog and chew fox?"

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.690
No! No, they're a bunch
of fucking asswipes.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.015
I don't feel I'm going too far.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.587
I want them Tc shut the hell up.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.569
They're not representing me!

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:19.570
Mmm.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.697
Cool.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.699
I think what you said
is probably absolutely true.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.743
I think he probably indulges
in some of the same shit

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.787
that he sees other people...

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.922
and that he doesn't want to be
identified with the same thing,

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.709
he wants his own image saved.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:46.723
Um, and it's purely
for his own...

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:50.134
I think. It's...

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.928
it's for him.

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:56.941
The people that are enjoying

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.271
the fandom the most,

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:01.278
the people that get
fandom the most

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.485
and get the most out of it

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.946
are the ones that basically say,

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.530
"I don't give a fuck."

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.536
I don't give a fuck
what dragoneer says.

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.948
I don't give a fuck
what uncle kage says.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:15.209
"I don't give a fuck
about any of that shit."

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.996
<i>N</i>

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:22.758
âŞ like magic he appears âŞ

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:26.763
âŞ A hero to save the day âŞ

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:31.142
âŞ and just when you think
he's here for good âŞ

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:36.147
âŞ That's when he goes away âŞ

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:39.354
âŞ 'Cause he's boomer âŞ

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:40.768
âŞ Boomer âŞ

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.438
âŞ Boomer âŞ

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:47.150
So, this is all about-

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.785
and you can see
it's still in German.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:53.619
The titles are still in German
and stuff like that.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.374
See, and when I would hear him,

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.786
I would tape record
these barks-

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.171
the pieces,
the parts of the show

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.054
where he was barking
and stuff like that.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:03.381
And then I'd play it back

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:07.170
and I would try
to learn his bark.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:08.428
And that's how I got

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.010
the "here's boomer" bark for me.

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.174
I'd just listen over and over

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.514
and then try to bark like that.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.349
That's the
only way to shut him up.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:17.881
You figured it out for yourself.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:20.607
Good for you, boomer.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.394
The thing ls,
ls why did that hit me

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:27.031
when it could've been
just as much the human world?

01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:29.032
Because I was
in the human world.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:30.488
So, why would the dog, like,

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:31.618
step out, you know,

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:36.533
and get me so much

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.826
when it could've been
any number of factors

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.540
or anything else?

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:42.626
But somehow I was different,

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.007
and then somehow
the dog was there,

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:49.216
and then somehow I kept on
being canine all this time,

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:51.426
whatever it's been now.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.840
I don't know how long,

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.652
like, 40 years
or something ridiculous?

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.928
I don't know.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:00.063
I just go right across here.
You don't mind?

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:01.439
Okay.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:12.076
There's kind of a way
of doing things

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:14.236
in the furry scene now

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.371
that I think allows
less expression

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.874
than it did when
I first came on the scene.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.535
You didn't have
that kind of-

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:25.047
there wasn't a social pressure
to conformity as much.

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.254
Which is weird
to be even saying,

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:30.260
because furry is this different
thing to begin with.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.888
So I kind of don't understand...

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:36.267
I don't understand some
of the modern philosophy.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:38.427
But I kinda do,
because, like, I bark.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.097
People come into the scene
and that's all they know,

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:44.688
so they expect other people
to be similar.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.522
I love furries so much.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.905
I want to see all kinds
of people have it

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:50.485
and enjoy it if they'd like to.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.899
And I'd like them to see

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.285
all the sides of furry,
you know,

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:55.728
good and bad, whatever it is.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.954
I don't think
there's much bad to it.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.709
It's people trying to discover
themselves in different ways.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.296
Right away when I did this,
I was told,

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:14.680
"why don't you just keep your
regular name like the rest of us?"

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.307
And I was like...
I almost, like-

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:18.934
I was angry, but I was
laughing at the same time

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:20.310
because I was like,

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:22.312
"that's not what
it's about for me."
