00:14.243 --> 00:17.590
- I said, no.
- A sapphire waterfall!

00:17.690 --> 00:19.574
It's a waterfall, made of sapphires!

00:19.849 --> 00:21.480
<i>This enormous jewel,
size of a glacier,</i>

00:21.580 --> 00:24.660
reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, then
shatters into sapphires at the edge,

00:24.760 --> 00:27.581
they fall 100,000 feet
into a crystal ravine.

00:27.681 --> 00:31.755
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- Oh, come on, they're boarding now.

00:31.855 --> 00:34.250
It's no fun on my own.
Four hours, that's all it takes.

00:34.657 --> 00:38.889
<i>No, that's four hours there and four
hours back, that's like a school trip.</i>

00:38.989 --> 00:41.116
- I'd rather go sunbathing!
- You be careful.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.016
<i>That's X-tonic sunlight.</i>

00:43.116 --> 00:47.475
Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure,
this glass is 15-feet thick.

00:47.575 --> 00:48.680
<i>All right, I give up.</i>

00:48.780 --> 00:51.504
Back for dinner, we'll try that
antigravity restaurant. With bibs.

00:51.604 --> 00:52.355
<i>That's a date.</i>

00:52.641 --> 00:53.767
Well, not a date.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.739
Oh, you know what I mean.
Oh, get off!

00:55.977 --> 00:57.120
- See you later.
- Oy!

00:57.220 --> 00:59.589
- And you be careful, all right?
- Naaah.

00:59.689 --> 01:00.690
Taking a big space truck

01:00.790 --> 01:03.346
with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?

01:03.446 --> 01:04.985
What could possibly go wrong?

and complimentary...</i>

01:45.424 --> 01:47.235
<i>Just the headphones, please.</i>

01:47.695 --> 01:48.934
There you go.

01:50.063 --> 01:52.560
That's the headphones
for Channels 1 to 36,

01:59.571 --> 02:01.545
I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.

02:01.814 --> 02:03.290
That'll be the peanuts.

02:03.935 --> 02:07.019
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait! Allons-y!

02:07.708 --> 02:10.550
- I'm sorry?
- It's French, for let's go!

02:10.815 --> 02:12.070
Fascinating.

02:13.439 --> 02:15.948
- Headphones for channels 1-36...
- No thank you! Not for us!

02:16.048 --> 02:18.133
- Earplugs, please.
- There you go.

02:18.233 --> 02:21.755
They call it a sapphire waterfall,
but it's no such thing,

02:21.855 --> 02:24.040
sapphire's an aluminium oxide,

02:24.140 --> 02:27.664
but the glacier is just a compound
silica with iron pigmentation!

02:27.764 --> 02:30.361
<i>- Have you got that pillow for my neck?
- Yes, sir.</i>

02:30.461 --> 02:31.555
<i>And the pills?</i>

02:31.655 --> 02:34.889
Yes, all measured
out for you, there you go.

02:35.527 --> 02:36.220
Hobbes!

02:36.320 --> 02:38.190
Professor Winfold Hobbes!

02:38.290 --> 02:40.718
- I'm the Doctor, hello!
- It's my 14th time!

02:40.937 --> 02:42.165
Oh! My first.

02:42.265 --> 02:44.117
And I'm Dee Dee, Dee Dee Blasco.

02:44.217 --> 02:47.332
Don't bother the man!
Where's my water bottle?

02:47.432 --> 02:50.142
<i>Complimentary slippers,
complimentary juicepack,</i>

02:50.242 --> 02:51.731
<i>and complimentary peanuts,</i>

02:51.831 --> 02:54.750
<i>I must warn you some
products may contain nuts.</i>

02:55.010 --> 02:59.395
Don't be silly, come and sit with us.
Look! We get slippers!

02:59.495 --> 03:01.779
- Jethro! Do what your mother says.
- I'm sitting here.

03:01.879 --> 03:04.683
Oh, he's ashamed of us.
But he doesn't mind us paying, does he?

03:04.783 --> 03:07.993
Don't you two start. Should I save
the juicepack or have it now?

03:08.093 --> 03:09.870
Look, it's peach and clementine!

03:10.545 --> 03:12.862
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

03:12.962 --> 03:16.709
welcome on board the Crusader 50,
if you would fasten your seatbelts,

03:16.809 --> 03:18.670
we'll be leaving any moment.

03:19.335 --> 03:19.990
Doors!

03:23.020 --> 03:23.910
Shields down!

03:28.770 --> 03:32.138
I'm afraid the view is shielded
until we reach the Waterfall Palace.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.161
Also, a reminder, Midnight has no air,

03:35.261 --> 03:38.440
so please don't touch
the exterior door seals.

03:38.909 --> 03:41.119
Fire exit at the rear,
and should we need to use it...

03:41.388 --> 03:42.550
you first.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.531
Now I will hand you
over to Driver Joe...

03:47.107 --> 03:48.145
<i>Driver Joe at the wheel!</i>

03:48.550 --> 03:50.765
<i>There's been a diamondfall
at the Winter Witch Canyon,</i>

03:50.865 --> 03:54.025
<i>so we'll be taking a slight detour,
as you'll see on the map.</i>

03:54.438 --> 03:57.391
<i>The journey covers 500
kliks to the Multifaceted Coast,</i>

03:57.710 --> 04:00.400
<i>duration is estimated at four hours.</i>

04:00.726 --> 04:02.215
<i>Thank you for travelling with us,</i>

04:02.315 --> 04:05.420
<i>and as they used to say
in the olden days, wagons roll!</i>

04:13.239 --> 04:14.341
<i>For your entertainment,</i>

04:14.441 --> 04:18.394
we have the Music Channel
playing retrovids of Earth Classics.

# "Do It Do It Again" #
by Raffaella Carra

04:21.974 --> 04:25.710
Also, the latest artistic
installation from Ludovic Klein.

04:28.082 --> 04:30.887
<i>Plus, for the youngsters,
a rare treat : </i>

04:30.987 --> 04:32.470
the Animation Archives.

04:33.176 --> 04:36.530
Four hours of funtime!
Enjoy!

05:05.430 --> 05:06.687
Well, that's a mercy!

05:06.787 --> 05:11.274
I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon.

05:11.374 --> 05:13.822
We seem to have had a failure
of the Entertainment System...

05:14.010 --> 05:14.735
Aw...

05:14.835 --> 05:17.513
- But what do we do?!
- We've got four hours of this!

05:17.613 --> 05:19.634
Four hours of just sitting here!

05:19.734 --> 05:23.270
Tell you what! We'll have to talk
to each other instead!

05:28.292 --> 05:30.883
98 KLIKS LATER...

05:33.659 --> 05:35.129
<i>So Biff said, "I'm going swimming".</i>

05:35.229 --> 05:38.501
Oh, I was all ready,
trunks and everything! Nose plug!

05:38.601 --> 05:40.929
He had this little nose plug,
you should've seen him.

05:41.029 --> 05:43.112
I went marching up to the lifeguard,

05:43.212 --> 05:46.256
and he was a Shamboni,
you know, those big foreheads?

05:46.413 --> 05:47.727
<i>Great big forehead!</i>

05:47.827 --> 05:49.779
And I said, where's the pool?

05:49.879 --> 05:52.632
And he said, "The pool is abstract!"

05:54.763 --> 05:56.128
It wasn't a real pool!

05:56.228 --> 05:58.625
- It was a concept!
- And you wore a nose plug!

05:58.725 --> 06:01.146
I was like this!
Mmm... where's the pool?

06:04.591 --> 06:07.594
150 KLIKS LATER...

06:08.100 --> 06:09.721
<i>I'm just a second-year student,</i>

06:09.821 --> 06:12.240
but I wrote a paper on
the Lost Moon of Poosh,

06:12.506 --> 06:15.600
Professor Hobbes read it, liked it,
took me on as a researcher.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.406
Just for the holidays. Well...

06:17.506 --> 06:21.317
I say researcher, most of the time
he's got me fetching and carrying.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.066
- But it's all good experience!
- And did they ever find it?

06:24.166 --> 06:26.355
- Find what?
- The Lost Moon of Poosh!

06:26.887 --> 06:28.213
No! Not yet!

06:28.313 --> 06:32.395
Well, maybe that'll be your great
discovery, one day. Here's to Poosh!

06:32.715 --> 06:33.777
Poosh!

06:34.233 --> 06:35.891
209 KLIKS LATER...

06:35.991 --> 06:38.560
No, no, I'm with this
friend of mine,

06:38.725 --> 06:41.435
Donna, she stayed behind
in the Leisure Palace. You?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.000
No, it's just me.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.075
Oh, I've done plenty of that.

06:45.348 --> 06:46.960
Travelling on my own.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.309
I love it.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.243
- Do what you want! Go anywhere!
- I'm still getting used to it.

06:51.987 --> 06:55.235
I've... found myself single,
rather recently. Not by choice.

06:55.427 --> 06:57.550
- What happened?
- Oh, the usual.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.350
She needed her own
space, as they say.

07:01.038 --> 07:02.845
A different galaxy, in fact.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.147
I reckon that's enough space, don't you?

07:05.489 --> 07:06.149
Yeah.

07:07.501 --> 07:09.528
I had a friend who went
to a different universe.

07:11.089 --> 07:13.789
Oh, what's this, chicken or beef?

07:14.450 --> 07:15.780
I think it's both.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.359
251 KLIKS LATER...

07:20.459 --> 07:22.686
<i>So this is Midnight, d'you see?</i>

07:22.786 --> 07:28.315
Bombarded by the sun!
X-tonic rays, raw Galvanic Radiation...

07:28.994 --> 07:30.395
<i>Dee Dee, next slide!</i>

07:31.437 --> 07:33.000
<i>It's my pet project.</i>

07:33.465 --> 07:36.937
Actually, I'm the first person
to research this.

07:37.037 --> 07:38.500
Because you see...

07:41.270 --> 07:43.117
..the history is fascinating,

07:44.038 --> 07:46.200
because there is no history.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.720
There's no life in this entire system,
there couldn't be.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.449
Before the Leisure Palace
Company moved in,

07:52.549 --> 07:56.275
no-one had come here in all eternity.

07:56.668 --> 07:58.703
No living thing...

08:01.775 --> 08:03.080
But how d'you know?

08:03.486 --> 08:05.197
I mean, if no-one can go outside...

08:05.297 --> 08:06.924
Oh, his imagination! Here we go!

08:07.024 --> 08:08.911
- He's got a point, though.
- Exactly!

08:09.011 --> 08:13.529
We look upon this world through glass.
Safe inside our metal box.

08:13.629 --> 08:16.830
Even the Leisure Palace
was lowered down from orbit.

08:17.245 --> 08:20.075
And here we are now,
crossing Midnight...

08:20.648 --> 08:22.556
but never touching it.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.110
We've stopped.

08:30.729 --> 08:31.980
<i>Have we stopped?</i>

08:33.212 --> 08:34.001
<i>Are we there?</i>

08:34.101 --> 08:35.440
We can't be, it's too soon.

08:35.539 --> 08:38.626
<i>They don't stop,
Crusader vehicles never stop.</i>

08:38.982 --> 08:42.830
If you could just return to your seats,
it's just a small delay.

08:47.630 --> 08:49.510
- Maybe just a pit stop.
- What's going on?

08:49.610 --> 08:52.898
There's no pit to stop in, I've been
on this expedition 14 times,

08:52.998 --> 08:53.824
they never stop.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.967
Evidently, we have stopped,
so there's no point in denying it.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.191
- We've broken down!
- Thanks, Jethro.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.486
- In the middle of nowhere!
- That's enough, stop it!

09:02.586 --> 09:05.369
Ladies and gentlemen
and variations thereupon,

09:05.469 --> 09:08.050
we're just experiencing a short...

09:08.288 --> 09:11.642
delay, the driver needs
to stabilise the engine feeds.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.613
Perfectly routine, so if you could
just stay in your seats...

09:14.713 --> 09:16.659
- No, I'm sorry sir...
- There you go,

09:16.759 --> 09:20.075
- engine expert Two ticks!
- Sorry, sir, if you could sit down!

09:20.277 --> 09:22.298
- You're not supposed...
- If you could return...

09:22.398 --> 09:24.310
Company insurance,
let's get an assessment...

09:24.410 --> 09:26.421
So, what's the problem, Driver Joe?

09:26.521 --> 09:28.880
We're stabilising the engine feeds,
won't take long.

09:28.980 --> 09:32.431
Um, no, cos that's the engine feed,
that light there, and it's fine,

09:32.531 --> 09:35.259
and it's a micropetrol engine,
so stabilising doesn't make sense?

09:35.359 --> 09:38.282
Soory, I'm a doctor. I'm very clever.
So what's wrong?

09:38.460 --> 09:41.286
We just stopped, look, all systems fine
and everything's working,

09:41.386 --> 09:42.900
but we're not moving.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.017
You're right.
No faults. And who are you?

09:46.398 --> 09:48.990
Claude, I'm the mechanic. Trainee.

09:49.402 --> 09:50.734
Nice to meet you.

09:50.834 --> 09:54.127
I've sent a distress signal. They should
dispatch a rescue truck, top speed.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.395
- How long till they get here?
- About an hour.

09:56.692 --> 09:58.731
Well, since we're waiting...

09:59.570 --> 10:01.223
shall we take a look outside?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.600
Lift the screens a bit?

10:04.908 --> 10:07.840
It's 100% X-tonic out there,
we'd be vaporised.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.878
No, those windows are Finitoglass,
give you a couple of minutes. Go on!

10:12.591 --> 10:13.910
Live a little!

10:28.584 --> 10:30.075
<i>That is beautiful...</i>

10:30.808 --> 10:32.360
<i>Look at all those diamonds!</i>

10:32.647 --> 10:35.094
<i>Poisoned by the sun.
No-one can ever touch them.</i>

10:35.194 --> 10:36.962
Joe, you said we took a detour?

10:37.062 --> 10:39.992
- Just 40 kliks to the west.
- Is that a recognised path?

10:40.092 --> 10:43.022
No, it's a new one, the computer
worked it out, on automatic.

10:43.316 --> 10:44.786
So we're the first?

10:45.412 --> 10:46.757
<i>This piece of ground.</i>

10:47.364 --> 10:49.175
<i>No-one's ever been here before.</i>

10:50.845 --> 10:53.198
<i>Not in the whole of recorded history.</i>

10:53.298 --> 10:54.355
Did you just...?

10:56.119 --> 10:58.995
- No, sorry. Nothing.
- What did you see?

10:59.095 --> 11:00.560
Just there. That ridge.

11:01.085 --> 11:03.799
<i>Like... a shadow. Just for a second.</i>

11:04.056 --> 11:05.350
What sort of shadow?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.632
X-tonic rising!

11:07.871 --> 11:09.041
Shields down.

11:11.024 --> 11:13.520
Look, there he is, look, there!
- Where ?

11:15.130 --> 11:16.029
What was it?

11:16.129 --> 11:19.428
Like, just, something...
shifting, something sort of... dark.

11:19.848 --> 11:21.343
Like it was... running.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.235
Running which way?

11:23.583 --> 11:25.110
Towards us.

11:25.210 --> 11:29.355
Doctor, back to your seat
and not a word, rescue's on its way.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.825
<i>If you could close the door,
thank you.</i>

11:35.883 --> 11:38.586
What did they say? Did they tell you?
What is it, what's wrong?

11:38.686 --> 11:40.720
Oh, just stabilising,
happens all the time.

11:40.957 --> 11:42.177
I don't need this.

11:42.384 --> 11:44.705
I'm on a schedule.
This is completely unnecessary!

11:44.805 --> 11:46.516
Back to your seats, thank you.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.646
Excuse me, Doctor,

11:52.719 --> 11:54.560
but they're micropetrol
engines, aren't they?

11:54.660 --> 11:57.027
- Now, don't bother the man.
- My father was a mechanic.

11:57.739 --> 12:00.671
Micropetrol doesn't stabilise,
what does 'stabilise' mean?

12:01.004 --> 12:03.510
Well. Bit of flim-flam.
Don't worry, they're sorting it out.

12:03.610 --> 12:06.243
- So it's not the engines?
- Just a little pause, that's all.

12:06.537 --> 12:07.729
<i>How much air have we got?</i>

12:07.829 --> 12:08.717
Professor, it's fine.

12:08.817 --> 12:10.025
- What did he say?
- Nothing!

12:10.125 --> 12:12.421
- Are we running out of air?
- I was just speculating...

12:12.521 --> 12:15.312
- Right miss? Are we running out of air?
- Is that the Captain said?

12:15.412 --> 12:16.588
If you could remain calm...

12:16.688 --> 12:18.465
- How much air have we got?
- Mum, stop it.

12:18.565 --> 12:20.825
- Everything's under control.
- Doesn't look like it!

12:20.925 --> 12:21.601
He said it.

12:21.701 --> 12:23.622
Fine, the air is on a circular filter...

12:23.722 --> 12:26.115
- He started it!
- Everyone...

12:27.935 --> 12:29.360
QUIET!

12:34.252 --> 12:35.147
Thank you.

12:36.079 --> 12:38.982
Now, if you'd care to listen
to my good friend Dee Dee...

12:40.909 --> 12:41.585
Oh!

12:42.369 --> 12:43.214
Um...

12:43.558 --> 12:44.609
It's just that...

12:44.709 --> 12:48.795
Well, the air's on a circular filter so,
we could stay breathing for ten years.

12:49.545 --> 12:50.465
<i>There you go!</i>

12:51.032 --> 12:54.780
And I've spoken to the Captain,
I can guarantee you, everything's fine.

13:01.630 --> 13:02.769
What was that?

13:02.869 --> 13:05.378
It must be the metal.
We're cooling down,

13:05.678 --> 13:07.990
- it's just settling...
- Rocks. Could be rocks falling.

13:08.090 --> 13:10.477
What I want to know is,
how long do we have to sit here.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.329
- What is that?
- Someone's out there!

13:14.429 --> 13:16.744
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Like I said, it could be rocks.

13:16.844 --> 13:19.630
We're in the open.
Nothing could fall against the sides.

13:21.555 --> 13:22.790
Knock knock.

13:23.332 --> 13:24.552
Who's there?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.241
<i>Is there something out there?</i>

13:33.140 --> 13:35.194
Well? Anyone?

13:36.695 --> 13:38.184
What the hell is making that noise?

13:38.284 --> 13:41.137
I'm sorry, but the light
out there is X-tonic,

13:41.607 --> 13:45.788
<i>that means it would destroy
any living thing, in a split-second.</i>

13:45.888 --> 13:50.149
<i>It is impossible for
someone to be outside.</i>

13:54.672 --> 13:56.203
What the hell is that, then?!

13:56.773 --> 13:58.972
Sir! You really should
get back to your seat.

14:04.484 --> 14:05.460
Hello?

14:09.410 --> 14:10.340
It's moving...

14:16.380 --> 14:17.400
It's trying the door.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.717
There is no 'it',
there's nothing out there. Can't be.

14:37.014 --> 14:38.659
That's the entrance. Can it get in?

14:38.759 --> 14:40.993
No, that door's on 200
weight of hydraulics.

14:41.093 --> 14:44.515
- Stop it. Don't encourage them.
- What do you think it is?

14:44.809 --> 14:46.675
- Biff, don't...
- Mr Cane, better not...

14:47.829 --> 14:49.078
It's cast iron, that door...

14:53.344 --> 14:56.033
Three times! Did you hear that,
it did it three times?!

14:56.133 --> 14:57.775
- It answered!
- It did it three times!

14:57.875 --> 14:59.364
All right, everyone, calm down.

14:59.464 --> 15:04.145
No, but it answered, don't tell me
that thing's not alive, it answered him!

15:05.253 --> 15:08.480
I really must insist,
you get back to your seats...

15:08.580 --> 15:10.902
No! Don't just stand there
telling us the rules!

15:11.002 --> 15:12.153
You're the hostess,

15:12.253 --> 15:14.275
you're supposed to do something!

15:25.441 --> 15:27.362
What the hell's making that noise?

15:27.556 --> 15:31.799
She said she'd get me. Stop it,
make it stop, somebody make it stop!

15:31.899 --> 15:35.013
Don't stand there looking at me, not
my fault, he started it with stories.

15:35.113 --> 15:36.839
- Calm down!
- He made it worse.

15:36.939 --> 15:39.699
- Why couldn't you leave it alone?
- Stop staring at me!

15:39.799 --> 15:42.080
- Just tell me what it is.
- Calm down!

15:45.349 --> 15:46.697
It's coming for me,

15:47.579 --> 15:50.538
it's coming for me,
it's coming for me...

15:51.464 --> 15:55.424
It's coming for me!
It's coming for me.

15:57.930 --> 15:59.070
Get out of there!

16:20.620 --> 16:21.190
OK?

16:27.460 --> 16:29.441
Arms. Legs. Neck.
Head. Nose. I'm fine...

16:30.717 --> 16:32.019
Everyone else?

16:34.225 --> 16:36.990
How are we?
Everyone all right?

16:37.422 --> 16:39.286
<i>Earthquake, must be...</i>

16:39.386 --> 16:42.427
But that's impossible,
the ground is fixed, it's solid.

16:42.527 --> 16:46.589
Got torches, everyone take a torch,
they're in the back of the seats.

16:50.406 --> 16:53.248
Oh, Jethro, sweetheart, come here...

16:53.348 --> 16:55.344
Never mind me, what about her?

16:58.090 --> 16:59.961
<i>- What happened to the seats?
- Who did that?</i>

17:00.061 --> 17:01.365
<i>They've been ripped up.</i>

17:03.821 --> 17:06.387
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right, it's over.

17:06.819 --> 17:08.027
We're still alive...

17:08.290 --> 17:10.067
<i>Look, the wall's still intact.
D'you see?</i>

17:10.166 --> 17:12.069
- Joe, Claude?
- We're safe.

17:12.170 --> 17:13.801
Driver Joe, can you hear me?

17:14.296 --> 17:17.239
I'm not getting any response,
the intercom must be down.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.439
What happened? What was that?

17:26.539 --> 17:28.590
Is it the driver?
Have we lost the driver?

17:29.323 --> 17:31.294
- The cabin's gone.
- Don't be ridiculous.

17:31.394 --> 17:34.216
- It can't be gone, how can it be gone?
- Well, you saw it!

17:34.316 --> 17:36.872
There was nothing there,
like it was ripped away.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.090
What are you doing?

17:38.190 --> 17:40.130
That's bit of light, thank you.
Molto bene!

17:40.230 --> 17:42.995
- You know what you're doing?
- Cabin's gone, leave that wall alone.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.272
The cabin can't be gone!

17:44.372 --> 17:47.720
No, it's safe, any rupture
would automatically seal itself...

17:49.935 --> 17:51.518
But something sliced it off.

17:53.428 --> 17:56.150
- You're right. The cabin's gone.
- But if it gets separated...

17:56.250 --> 17:57.577
<i>It loses integrity.</i>

18:00.668 --> 18:02.745
I'm sorry. They've been reduced to dust.

18:03.990 --> 18:05.349
<i>The driver and the mechanic.</i>

18:06.882 --> 18:08.503
But they sent a distress signal.

18:08.603 --> 18:10.311
Help is on its way.
They saved our lives!

18:10.411 --> 18:12.350
We're gonna get out of here, I promise.

18:12.751 --> 18:14.870
<i>We're still alive,
and they're gonna find us.</i>

18:14.970 --> 18:16.262
Doctor. Look at her.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.474
Right, yes, sorry...
Have we got a medical kit?

18:21.774 --> 18:23.006
Why won't she turn around?

18:25.896 --> 18:30.030
- What's her name?
- Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.472
Sky?

18:33.629 --> 18:34.655
Can you hear me?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.557
Are you all right?

18:39.310 --> 18:40.411
Can you move, Sky?

18:42.395 --> 18:43.358
Just look at me.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.926
That noise, from outside...

18:49.860 --> 18:51.749
- it's stopped.
- Well, thank God for that.

18:51.849 --> 18:53.718
But what if it's
not outside any more?

18:55.370 --> 18:57.900
- What if it's inside?
- Inside? Where?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.200
It was heading for her.

19:01.530 --> 19:02.241
<i>Sky...</i>

19:03.461 --> 19:04.700
it's all right, Sky.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.460
I just want you to turn around,

19:08.967 --> 19:09.830
face me.

19:47.165 --> 19:47.947
Sky?

19:50.491 --> 19:51.317
Sky?

19:53.268 --> 19:55.539
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

19:55.721 --> 19:57.630
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.676
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to talk.

20:01.051 --> 20:03.110
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm trying to help.

20:03.404 --> 20:05.899
- My name's the Doctor.
- My name's the Doctor.

20:06.231 --> 20:08.596
- OK, can you stop?
- OK, can you stop?

20:08.696 --> 20:10.756
- I'd like you to stop.
- I'd like you to stop.

20:10.856 --> 20:13.035
- Why's she doing that?
- Why's she doing that?

20:13.135 --> 20:14.621
- She's gone mad.
- She's gone mad.

20:14.721 --> 20:16.930
- Stop it. I said stop it!
- Stop it. I said stop it!

20:17.030 --> 20:19.070
- I Don't think she can.
- I Don't think she can.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.503
- Stop it, this isn't funny.
- Stop it, this isn't funny.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.592
- Sh, sh, all of you.
- Sh, sh, all of you.

20:23.692 --> 20:25.322
- My name's Jethro!
- My name's Jethro!

20:25.422 --> 20:28.195
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!
- Jethro, leave it, shut up!

20:34.474 --> 20:37.452
- Why are you repeating?
- Why are you repeating?

20:40.324 --> 20:42.750
- What is that, learning?
- What is that, learning?

20:43.356 --> 20:45.081
- Copying?
- Copying?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.479
- Absorbing?
- Absorbing?

20:52.438 --> 20:54.922
- The square root of pi is...
- The square root of pi is...

20:55.022 --> 21:00.315
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...
- 1.77245385090551602729816748...

21:00.415 --> 21:02.750
- 3341. Wow!
- 3341. Wow!

21:07.775 --> 21:09.766
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

21:09.866 --> 21:11.618
- She couldn't repeat all that.
- She...

21:11.718 --> 21:13.032
"Tell her to stop!"

21:13.132 --> 21:14.810
"She's driving me mad."

21:14.910 --> 21:16.187
"Make her STOP!"

21:16.287 --> 21:18.833
"Stop her staring at me, shut her up..."

21:20.698 --> 21:22.437
"Telling you, whatever your name is."

21:22.537 --> 21:23.974
"Stop it..."

21:24.900 --> 21:27.227
"What's wrong with her eyes?"

21:33.650 --> 21:35.506
"Six, six, six."

21:45.607 --> 21:47.910
- That's the back-up system.
- Well!

21:48.604 --> 21:49.530
That's a bit better.

21:49.693 --> 21:53.184
- What about rescue, how long's?
- About 60 minutes, that's all.

21:54.016 --> 21:57.030
Then I suggest we all calm down.

21:57.445 --> 21:59.178
<i>This panic isn't helping.</i>

21:59.791 --> 22:04.311
<i>That poor woman is evidently
in a state of self-induced hysteria,</i>

22:04.411 --> 22:06.153
- we should leave her alone.
- Doctor...

22:07.030 --> 22:07.834
I know.

22:08.575 --> 22:10.447
Doctor, now step back,

22:11.122 --> 22:13.030
I think you should leave her...

22:14.054 --> 22:14.831
Alone.

22:18.426 --> 22:19.723
What's she doing?

22:21.264 --> 22:22.531
How can she do that?

22:22.631 --> 22:25.670
She's talking with you...
and with me!

22:26.180 --> 22:27.211
Oh, my God!

22:28.022 --> 22:28.963
Biff, what's she doing?

22:29.063 --> 22:30.091
She's repeating...

22:31.307 --> 22:34.037
- At exactly the same time.
- That's impossible.

22:34.137 --> 22:37.430
-There's not even a delay.
- Ohh man, that is weird.

22:37.615 --> 22:41.275
I think you should all be very,
very quiet, have you got that?

22:41.375 --> 22:43.488
- How's she doing it?
- Mrs Cane, please, be quiet.

22:43.588 --> 22:46.743
But how can she do that?
She's got my voice, she's got my words!

22:46.843 --> 22:49.055
Sweetheart, be quiet, just...
hush now. Hush.

22:50.138 --> 22:52.219
- She's doing it to me!
- Just stop it, all of you.

22:52.319 --> 22:53.372
Stop it. Please.

23:00.710 --> 23:03.340
Now then, Sky. Are you Sky?

23:04.395 --> 23:05.928
Is Sky still in there?

23:06.028 --> 23:07.364
Mrs Silvestry?

23:10.504 --> 23:13.900
You know exactly what I'm going to say,
how are you doing that?

23:16.974 --> 23:18.154
Roast beef!

23:19.086 --> 23:20.062
Bananas!

23:21.013 --> 23:22.765
The Medusa Cascade.

23:25.899 --> 23:26.688
Bang!

23:27.057 --> 23:29.512
Rose Tyler, Martha Jones,
Donna Noble, TARDIS!

23:32.359 --> 23:35.099
Shamble bobble dibble dooble.

23:36.432 --> 23:38.836
Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome.
Yes, I am, thank you.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.980
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

23:51.054 --> 23:54.195
First she repeats. Then she catches up.
What's the next stage?

23:54.295 --> 23:55.671
Next stage of what?

23:55.771 --> 23:59.229
But that's not her, is it?
That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.

23:59.666 --> 24:01.434
I don't think so, no.

24:04.913 --> 24:05.902
I think...

24:06.878 --> 24:09.224
the more we talk,
the more she learns.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.758
Now, I'm all for education,
but in this case...

24:13.003 --> 24:16.491
maybe not. Let's just... move back.
Come on. Come with me.

24:16.591 --> 24:18.635
Everyone, get back,
all of you, as far as you can.

24:18.735 --> 24:20.136
Doctor, make her stop.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.654
Val, come on,
come to the back, stop looking at her,

24:22.754 --> 24:25.150
come on, Jethro, you too,
everyone, come on...

24:25.910 --> 24:27.393
50 minutes. That's all we need.

24:27.493 --> 24:29.520
50 minutes till
the rescue arrives. And...

24:29.814 --> 24:33.080
she's not exactly strong, look at her,
all she's got is our voices.

24:33.455 --> 24:35.333
I can't look at her.
It's those eyes.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.353
We must not look at goblin men.

24:45.505 --> 24:49.078
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a poem. Christina Rossetti.

24:54.878 --> 24:57.803
We must not look at goblin men.
We must not buy their fruits.

24:57.903 --> 25:01.526
Who knows upon what soil they fed.
Their hungry, thirsty roots?

25:03.103 --> 25:04.304
I don't think that's helping.

25:04.404 --> 25:08.150
She's not a goblin, or a monster,
she's just a very sick woman.

25:08.410 --> 25:11.349
- Maybe that's why it went for her.
- There is no 'it!'

25:11.449 --> 25:14.040
Think about it. That knocking,
went all the way round the bus.

25:14.140 --> 25:15.209
Till it found her.

25:15.491 --> 25:17.682
And she was the most scared,
out of all of us.

25:18.971 --> 25:21.590
Maybe that's what it needed.

25:22.224 --> 25:24.527
- That's how it got in.
- For the last time!

25:25.050 --> 25:28.027
Nothing can live
on the surface of Midnight.

25:28.127 --> 25:31.093
Professor, I'm glad you've got
a definition of life in the universe,

25:31.193 --> 25:33.696
but perhaps the universe
has got ideas of its own, mm?

25:33.796 --> 25:35.543
Now trust me. I've got previous!

25:35.932 --> 25:37.633
I think there might well be some...

25:37.839 --> 25:41.049
consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry,
but maybe SHE's still in there.

25:41.149 --> 25:44.046
- It's our job to help her.
- You can help her, I'm not going near.

25:44.146 --> 25:45.378
No, I've got to stay back.

25:45.478 --> 25:48.188
If she's copying us,
maybe the final stage is becoming us.

25:48.288 --> 25:51.038
I don't want her becoming me,
or things could get a lot worse.

25:51.138 --> 25:54.013
- Oh, like you're so special.
- As it happens, yes, I am.

25:54.113 --> 25:56.478
So that's decided.
We stay back. And we wait.

25:56.710 --> 25:58.975
When the rescue ship comes,
we can get her to hospital.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.710
We should throw her out.

26:04.456 --> 26:05.839
I beg your pardon?

26:07.847 --> 26:09.580
- Can we do that?
- Don't be ridiculous.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.282
That thing, whatever it is,

26:11.382 --> 26:14.479
killed the driver, and the mechanic,
and I don't think she's finished yet.

26:14.579 --> 26:17.132
- She can't even move!
- Look, look at her eyes!

26:17.501 --> 26:20.670
She killed Joe,
and she killed Claude, and we're next.

26:20.770 --> 26:23.061
She's still doing it. Just stop it!

26:23.161 --> 26:24.710
Stop talking!! STOP IT!!!

26:24.810 --> 26:27.471
- Biff, don't, sweetheart!
- She won't stop!

26:28.506 --> 26:31.027
We can't throw her out though,
we can't even open the doors.

26:31.127 --> 26:32.992
No-one is getting thrown out!

26:40.639 --> 26:41.646
Yes, we can.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.804
<i>Cos there's an air pressure seal.</i>

26:44.125 --> 26:45.439
Like when you opened cabin door,

26:45.539 --> 26:47.534
you weren't pulled out,
you had a couple of sec,

26:47.634 --> 26:50.119
<i>cos it takes the pressure-wall
about six seconds to collapse.</i>

26:50.219 --> 26:52.127
Well, six seconds exactly.

26:52.796 --> 26:54.942
That's enough time to throw someone out.

26:55.418 --> 26:58.421
- Thanks, Dee Dee, just what we needed.
- Would it kill her? Outside?

26:58.521 --> 27:01.513
I don't know, but she's got a body now,
it would kill the physical form.

27:01.613 --> 27:03.760
No-one is killing anyone!

27:03.860 --> 27:06.465
I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice.
But we've got that one.

27:06.565 --> 27:08.898
All we need to do is grab hold
of her and throw her out.

27:08.998 --> 27:11.878
Now, listen! For all we know,
that's a brand new lifeform over there.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.555
And if it's come inside to discover us,
than what's it found?

27:14.962 --> 27:18.147
This little bunch of humans,
what d'you amount to?

27:18.891 --> 27:21.507
A murder? Cos this is where you decide.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.309
You decide who you are.

27:23.503 --> 27:26.475
Could you actually murder her?
Any of you?

27:26.981 --> 27:27.632
Really?

27:29.791 --> 27:31.470
Or are you better than that?

27:40.098 --> 27:40.950
I'd do it.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.113
- So would I.
- And me.

27:42.451 --> 27:43.765
- I think we should.
- What?!

27:43.865 --> 27:45.560
- I want her out.
- You can't say that!

27:45.660 --> 27:48.714
I'm sorry, but you said it yourself,
Doctor, she is growing in strength.

27:48.814 --> 27:51.082
- That's not what I said!
- I want to go home.

27:51.514 --> 27:53.835
I'm sorry. I want to be safe.

27:53.935 --> 27:56.288
You'll be safe,
the rescue truck is on its way.

27:56.388 --> 27:57.827
<i>What happens then, Doctor?</i>

27:58.389 --> 28:00.514
If it takes that thing back to
the Leisure Palace,

28:00.614 --> 28:03.074
if that thing reaches civilisation,
what if it spreads?

28:03.174 --> 28:05.579
When we get back to the base,
I'll be there to contain it.

28:05.679 --> 28:08.480
- You haven't done much so far!
- You'r standing with the rest of us!

28:08.580 --> 28:09.706
<i>She's dangerous.</i>

28:10.132 --> 28:13.230
It's my job to see this vessel is safe.
We should get rid of her.

28:13.330 --> 28:17.132
Now hang on, I think, perhaps,
we're all going a little bit too far.

28:17.232 --> 28:20.197
- At last! Thank you.
- Two people are dead!

28:20.297 --> 28:21.731
Don't make it a third!

28:25.303 --> 28:26.674
Jethro, what d'you say?

28:27.043 --> 28:28.651
- I'm not killing anyone.
- Thank you.

28:28.751 --> 28:30.634
- He's just a boy!
- What, I don't get a vote?

28:30.734 --> 28:32.710
There isn't a vote,
it's not happening! Ever.

28:34.206 --> 28:37.362
If you try to throw her out that door,
you'll have to get past me first.

28:40.878 --> 28:42.993
- OK.
- Fine by me.

28:43.093 --> 28:45.572
Oh, now you're being stupid.
Just think about it!

28:45.672 --> 28:48.306
Could you take someone
and throw them out of that door?

28:48.406 --> 28:49.235
Calling me a coward?

28:49.335 --> 28:51.230
- Who put you in charge?
- I'm sorry, but...

28:51.490 --> 28:53.333
you're a Doctor of what, exactly?

28:53.433 --> 28:54.684
He wasn't even booked in.

28:54.784 --> 28:58.532
Rest of you, tickets in advance.
He just turned up, out of the blue.

28:58.732 --> 28:59.807
<i>Where from?</i>

29:00.201 --> 29:01.490
I'm just... travelling,

29:01.590 --> 29:03.435
- I'm a traveller..
- Like an immigrant?

29:03.535 --> 29:06.952
Who were you talking to?
Before you got on board, who was that?

29:07.052 --> 29:08.042
Just Donna, my friend.

29:08.142 --> 29:10.364
- What were you saying her?
- Hasn't told us his name.

29:10.464 --> 29:12.810
Thing is, Doctor,
you've been loving this.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.437
Oh, Jethro, not you.

29:14.537 --> 29:17.396
No, but ever since all the trouble
started, you've been loving it.

29:17.496 --> 29:21.155
It has to be said,
you do seem to have a certain...glee.

29:21.255 --> 29:23.781
All right, I'm interested,
yes, I can't help it,

29:23.881 --> 29:26.152
cos whatever's inside her,
it's brand new,

29:26.252 --> 29:28.730
- and that's fascinating.
- What, you wanted this to happen?

29:28.830 --> 29:29.265
No!

29:29.365 --> 29:31.743
You were talking to her,
on your own, before the trouble,

29:31.843 --> 29:34.465
right at the front, you were
talking to that Sky woman,

29:34.565 --> 29:36.713
- the two of you together, I saw you.
- We all did!

29:36.813 --> 29:38.784
- You went in the cabin!
- What you said to her?

29:38.884 --> 29:40.333
- I was talking!
- Saying what?

29:40.433 --> 29:42.372
You called us humans
like you're not one of us.

29:42.472 --> 29:44.525
- He did! That's what he said!
- And the wiring,

29:44.625 --> 29:46.645
he went into that panel
and opened up the wiring.

29:46.745 --> 29:47.640
That was after.

29:47.740 --> 29:50.645
- But how did you know what to do?
- Because I'm clever.

29:55.675 --> 29:57.685
I see. Well.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.649
That makes things clear.

29:59.749 --> 30:01.695
And what are we, then? Idiots?

30:01.795 --> 30:02.765
That's not what I meant.

30:02.865 --> 30:04.154
If you're clever what are we?

30:04.254 --> 30:06.510
You've looked down on us
from the moment we walked in.

30:06.610 --> 30:08.882
Even if he goes,
he's practically volunteered.

30:08.982 --> 30:11.948
Oh come on,
just listen to yourself, please!

30:12.048 --> 30:12.839
D'you mean...?

30:13.540 --> 30:14.897
We throw him out as well?

30:22.847 --> 30:23.747
If we have to.

30:24.892 --> 30:25.806
Look, just...

30:26.744 --> 30:28.820
Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just...

30:30.010 --> 30:33.819
I know, you're scared,
and so am I, look at me, I am.

30:34.135 --> 30:38.155
But we have all got to calm down
and cool off and think.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.232
Perhaps you could tell us your name.

30:40.332 --> 30:42.252
- What does it matter?
- Then tell us.

30:43.935 --> 30:45.692
- John Smith.
- Your real name.

30:45.792 --> 30:48.270
He's lying, look at his face.
His eyes are the same as hers.

30:48.370 --> 30:50.222
- Tell us?!
- He's been lying to us,

30:50.322 --> 30:51.254
right from the start.

30:51.354 --> 30:52.737
No-one's called John Smith!

30:52.837 --> 30:54.583
Now listen to me right now!

30:54.683 --> 30:58.239
You need me, all of you, if we're going
to get out of this, then you need me.

30:58.339 --> 31:00.830
So you keep saying!
You've repeated yourself more than her.

31:00.930 --> 31:03.651
If anyone's in charge, it should be
the Professor, he's the expert!

31:03.751 --> 31:05.559
Stop, just look...

31:05.735 --> 31:07.658
- You keep out of this, Jethro.
- Look at her!

31:08.071 --> 31:09.210
She's stopped...

31:14.672 --> 31:17.619
When did she...?
No, she hasn't, she's still doing it.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.270
<i>She looks the same to me...</i>

31:19.641 --> 31:21.875
No, she's stopped!

31:22.707 --> 31:24.673
<i>Look, I'm talking, and she's not!</i>

31:24.773 --> 31:25.956
<i>What about me? Is she?</i>

31:26.056 --> 31:29.790
Look! Look at that!
She's not doing me, she's let me go!

31:30.050 --> 31:31.405
Mrs Silvestry?

31:33.573 --> 31:35.219
Nor me! Nothing!

31:36.495 --> 31:37.427
Sky?

31:38.622 --> 31:39.555
What are you doing?

31:39.655 --> 31:41.112
She's still doing him!

31:42.370 --> 31:45.232
Doctor. It's you.
She's only copying you.

31:46.477 --> 31:48.867
Why me? Why are you doing this?

31:48.967 --> 31:52.827
She won't leave him alone!
D'you see? I said so, she's with him.

31:52.927 --> 31:55.046
- They're together!
- How d'you explain it, Doctor?

31:55.215 --> 31:57.399
- If you're so clever.
- I don't know.

31:58.575 --> 31:59.882
Sky, stop it.

32:00.783 --> 32:02.854
I said stop it. Just stop it!

32:02.954 --> 32:04.414
<i>Look at the two of them...</i>

32:07.008 --> 32:09.950
Mrs Silvestry. I'm trying to understand.

32:10.937 --> 32:13.484
<i>You've captured my speech, what for?</i>

32:14.729 --> 32:16.111
What d'you need?

32:19.243 --> 32:21.721
You need my voice in particular.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.823
The cleverest voice in the room.

32:24.279 --> 32:27.316
Why? Cos I'm the only
one who can help?

32:28.154 --> 32:31.102
Oh, I'd love that to be true.
But your eyes.

32:32.034 --> 32:33.520
They're saying something else.

32:34.618 --> 32:38.278
Listen to me.
Whatever you want, if it's life,

32:38.378 --> 32:43.337
or form, or consciousness,
or voice, you don't have to steal it.

32:43.437 --> 32:46.090
You can find it
without hurting anyone.

32:47.148 --> 32:48.530
And I'll help you.

32:49.231 --> 32:50.729
That's a promise.

32:51.323 --> 32:52.012
So.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.425
What d'you think?

32:55.701 --> 32:57.891
- Do we have a deal?
- Do we have a deal?

33:02.661 --> 33:05.145
- Hold on, did she...?
- She spoke first.

33:05.245 --> 33:06.130
She can't have.

33:06.230 --> 33:08.020
<i>- She did!
- She spoke first!</i>

33:10.784 --> 33:16.377
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.
Oh, look at that, I'm ahead of you.

33:16.477 --> 33:20.675
Did you see? She spoke
before he did! Definitely!

33:20.900 --> 33:22.117
He's copying her.

33:23.249 --> 33:25.170
<i>Doctor? What's happening?</i>

33:25.270 --> 33:28.531
- I think it's moved.
- I think it's moved.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.597
- I think it's letting me go.
- I think it's letting me go.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.822
<i>What do you mean?
Letting you go from what?</i>

33:35.922 --> 33:38.510
<i>But he's repeating now,
he's the one doing it! It's him!</i>

33:39.266 --> 33:40.398
<i>They're separating.</i>

33:41.136 --> 33:42.431
<i>Mrs Silvestry?</i>

33:43.432 --> 33:44.567
Is that you?

33:44.780 --> 33:48.578
Yes, yes, it's me.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.179
Yes, yes, it's me...

33:50.279 --> 33:52.357
I'm coming back, listen.

33:52.457 --> 33:53.788
- I'm coming back...
- It's me!

33:53.888 --> 33:55.659
Listen. It's me!

33:56.110 --> 33:59.363
Like it's passed into the Doctor.
It's transferred. Whatever it is,

33:59.855 --> 34:01.110
it's gone inside him.

34:01.753 --> 34:04.281
No, that's not what happened.

34:08.844 --> 34:10.126
But look at her!

34:12.792 --> 34:15.607
Look at me, I can move...

34:15.706 --> 34:17.735
- Look at me...
- I can feel again...

34:17.911 --> 34:20.025
- I'm coming back to life.
- I can move...

34:20.126 --> 34:21.161
I can feel again.

34:21.262 --> 34:23.183
- And look at him.
- I'm coming back to life.

34:23.283 --> 34:26.699
- He can't move.
- And look at him, he can't move.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.283
- Help me.
- Help me.

34:33.382 --> 34:35.010
- Professor?
- Professor?

34:35.204 --> 34:38.188
<i>- Get me away from him.
- Get me away from him.</i>

34:38.370 --> 34:40.634
- Please.
- Please.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.645
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

34:56.745 --> 34:58.610
Oh, thank you.

34:58.710 --> 34:59.948
<i>They've completely separated.</i>

35:00.048 --> 35:03.270
It's in him, d'you see?
I said it was him all the time.

35:03.370 --> 35:05.643
She's free! She's been saved!

35:05.743 --> 35:08.840
- Oh, it was so cold.
- Oh, it was so cold.

35:09.103 --> 35:11.483
- I couldn't breathe.
- I couldn't breathe.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.280
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

35:13.380 --> 35:15.136
I must've scared you, so much.

35:15.236 --> 35:17.032
<i>I must've scared you, so much.</i>

35:17.132 --> 35:20.645
No, no, it's all right,
I've got you, ooh, there you are,

35:20.745 --> 35:23.148
my love, it's gone,
everything's all right now.

35:23.248 --> 35:24.195
I wouldn't touch her.

35:24.295 --> 35:26.230
But it's gone, she's clean,
it passed into him.

35:26.330 --> 35:27.492
That's not what happened.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.344
Thank you for your opinion, Dee,

35:29.444 --> 35:32.590
but clearly, Mrs Silvestry
has been released.

35:32.690 --> 35:34.539
- No.
- Just leave her alone!

35:34.764 --> 35:36.484
She's safe, isn't she?

35:37.047 --> 35:40.350
- Jethro? It's let her go, hasn't it?
- I think so, yeah.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.990
Looks like it. Professor?

35:43.658 --> 35:45.873
I'd say, from observation...

35:46.286 --> 35:48.200
the Doctor can't move,

35:48.463 --> 35:51.510
and when she was possessed,
she couldn't move, so...

35:51.610 --> 35:52.814
Well, there we are then!

35:53.452 --> 35:56.180
Now the only problem
we've got is this Doctor.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.783
- It's inside his head.
- It's inside his head.

36:02.175 --> 36:04.728
- It killed the driver.
- It killed the driver.

36:04.828 --> 36:07.001
- And the mechanic.
- And the mechanic.

36:07.101 --> 36:08.618
And now it wants us.

36:08.718 --> 36:11.055
- And now it wants us.
- I said so!

36:11.217 --> 36:14.189
- He's waited so long.
- He's waited so long.

36:14.289 --> 36:15.922
- In the dark.
- In the dark.

36:16.022 --> 36:18.055
- And the cold.
- And the cold.

36:18.155 --> 36:20.520
- And the diamonds.
- And the diamonds.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.867
- Until you came.
- Until you came.

36:22.967 --> 36:24.644
Bodies so hot.

36:24.744 --> 36:25.802
Bodies so hot.

36:25.902 --> 36:27.723
- With blood.
- With blood.

36:27.823 --> 36:29.549
- And pain.
- And pain.

36:29.649 --> 36:30.751
Someone make him stop.

36:30.851 --> 36:32.984
- But she's saying it!
- And you can shut up!

36:33.084 --> 36:35.687
It's not him, it's her,
he's just repeating!

36:35.787 --> 36:37.577
But that's what the
thing does, it repeats!

36:37.677 --> 36:39.748
- Let her talk.
- What do you know?

36:39.980 --> 36:41.131
Fat lot of good you've been!

36:41.231 --> 36:43.002
Just let her explain.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.747
I think...

36:45.398 --> 36:47.022
I mean, from what I've seen...

36:47.122 --> 36:49.967
it repeats, then it synchronises,
then it goes on to the next stage

36:50.067 --> 36:51.950
that's exactly what
the Doctor said would...

36:52.050 --> 36:53.866
- What, and you're on his side?
- No!

36:53.966 --> 36:56.505
- The voice is the thing!
- And she's the voice!

36:56.694 --> 36:58.950
She stole it! Look at her!

36:59.484 --> 37:01.793
It's not possessing him,
it's draining him!

37:02.106 --> 37:03.163
She's got his voice...

37:03.263 --> 37:05.322
<i>That's not true,
I saw it pass into him,</i>

37:05.422 --> 37:07.311
- I saw it with my own eyes!
- So did I!

37:07.411 --> 37:09.570
- You didn't!
- It went from her, to him.

37:09.933 --> 37:11.172
You saw it, didn't you?

37:11.272 --> 37:13.018
- I don't know.
- Don't be stupid, Jethro,

37:13.118 --> 37:14.076
of course you did!

37:14.295 --> 37:16.630
- I suppose he was right next to her.
- Everyone saw it!

37:16.730 --> 37:18.512
<i>But you're just making it up!</i>

37:18.612 --> 37:22.152
I know what I saw,
and I saw her stealing his voice.

37:22.252 --> 37:24.079
She's as bad as him,
someone shut her up.

37:24.179 --> 37:25.612
I think you should be quiet, Dee.

37:25.712 --> 37:27.608
- I'm only saying...
- And that's an order!

37:28.139 --> 37:29.803
<i>You're making a fool of yourself!</i>

37:29.903 --> 37:32.806
Pretending you're an expert
in mechanics and hydraulics,

37:32.906 --> 37:37.511
<i>when I can tell you, you are
nothing more than average, at best!</i>

37:37.692 --> 37:39.445
Now shut up!

37:39.545 --> 37:41.769
- That's how he does it.
- That's how he does it.

37:41.869 --> 37:44.071
- He makes you fight.
- He makes you fight.

37:44.171 --> 37:47.130
- Creeps into your head.
- Creeps into your head.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.363
- And whispers.
- And whispers.

37:49.463 --> 37:50.670
- Listen.
- Listen.

37:50.940 --> 37:52.548
- Just listen.
- Just listen.

37:52.648 --> 37:54.663
- That's him.
- That's him.

37:54.763 --> 37:56.709
- Inside.
- Inside.

37:56.809 --> 37:59.230
- Get him out of my head!
- Yeah, we should throw him out!

37:59.330 --> 38:01.221
Don't just talk about it!
Don't be so useless!

38:01.321 --> 38:03.636
- Do something!
- I will! You watch me!

38:03.736 --> 38:04.875
<i>I'm gonna throw him out!</i>

38:04.975 --> 38:06.277
- Yes!
- Yes!

38:06.377 --> 38:08.023
- Throw him out!
- Throw him out!

38:08.123 --> 38:10.219
- Get rid of him!
- Get rid of him!

38:10.319 --> 38:11.871
- Now!
- Now!

38:13.691 --> 38:15.418
- Don't!
- It'll be you next!

38:16.557 --> 38:18.064
I don't think we should do this.

38:18.164 --> 38:20.492
It was your idea!
Professor, help me.

38:20.592 --> 38:21.475
I can't...

38:21.575 --> 38:24.246
- I'm not...
- What sort of a man are you? Come on!

38:24.346 --> 38:27.430
Throw him out!
Just do it, throw him out!

38:27.878 --> 38:29.423
- Professor, help me.
- Get him out!

38:29.523 --> 38:31.801
Grab hold of him...
Not like that!! Are you stupid?!!

38:31.901 --> 38:33.627
- Cast him out!
- Cast him out!

38:33.727 --> 38:35.580
- Into the sun!
- Into the sun!

38:36.690 --> 38:38.820
- And the night!
- And the night!

38:39.690 --> 38:42.153
Come on.
Don't just stand there!

38:42.253 --> 38:44.431
- Do something say!!
- Get him out!

38:44.531 --> 38:45.663
- Do it!
- Do it!

38:45.763 --> 38:47.488
- Do it now!
- Do it now!

38:47.588 --> 38:49.353
- Faster!
- Faster!

38:49.530 --> 38:50.280
Just do it!

38:50.380 --> 38:52.700
- That's the way!
- That's the way!

38:52.800 --> 38:54.950
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

38:55.678 --> 38:59.731
- Molto bene!
- Molto bene!

38:59.831 --> 39:00.535
<i>Get him out!</i>

39:00.635 --> 39:03.667
- Allons-y!
- Allons-y!

39:03.905 --> 39:05.375
That's his voice.

39:05.475 --> 39:08.155
- The starlight waits!
- She's taken his voice.

39:08.462 --> 39:10.789
- The emptiness!
- Get him out!

39:10.889 --> 39:12.716
The Midnight sky!

39:12.816 --> 39:14.211
<i>The Midnight sky!</i>

39:14.311 --> 39:15.337
It's her.

39:21.514 --> 39:23.430
She's taken his voice!

39:27.360 --> 39:32.790
One, two, three, four, five, six.

39:37.699 --> 39:39.782
It's gone, it's gone...

39:41.140 --> 39:42.998
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

39:43.455 --> 39:44.415
It's gone.

39:44.913 --> 39:45.910
It's gone...

39:48.845 --> 39:50.430
<i>It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...</i>

39:51.129 --> 39:53.040
It's gone, it's gone, it's gone...

40:29.400 --> 40:30.600
I said it was her.

40:47.025 --> 40:50.630
20 MINUTES LATER...

40:52.466 --> 40:57.972
<i>Repeat, Crusader 50, rescue vehicle
coming alongside in three minutes,</i>

40:58.478 --> 41:00.793
<i>door-seals set to automatic.</i>

41:01.331 --> 41:05.800
<i>Prepare for boarding,
repeat, prepare for boarding.</i>

41:06.866 --> 41:07.870
The Hostess...

41:10.464 --> 41:11.915
what was her name?

41:22.549 --> 41:23.619
I don't know.

41:56.553 --> 41:57.798
<i>What d'you think it was?</i>

42:00.588 --> 42:01.583
No idea.

42:02.985 --> 42:04.486
D'you think it's still out there?

42:08.744 --> 42:10.371
Well, you'd better tell 'em.

42:10.971 --> 42:12.630
- This lot.
- Yeah.

42:12.999 --> 42:15.163
They can build a Leisure
Palace somewhere else.

42:15.929 --> 42:17.649
Let this planet keep on turning.

42:17.749 --> 42:19.770
Round an X-tonic star.

42:20.615 --> 42:21.866
In silence.

42:23.893 --> 42:25.783
Can't imagine you, without a voice.

42:27.134 --> 42:28.430
Molto bene.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.150
Molto bene!

42:31.532 --> 42:33.090
No, don't do that.

42:35.003 --> 42:35.800
Don't.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.434
Don't.

42:47.582 --> 42:49.722
Found a body, sir.
The Doctor is dead.

42:49.972 --> 42:52.406
<i>How could anything...
be worse than this?</i>

42:52.825 --> 42:54.646
What happened, what did they find?

42:54.746 --> 42:57.335
Oh, my God. The stars are going out.

42:57.435 --> 43:00.023
- Who are you?
- I was like you.

43:00.123 --> 43:03.295
- Turn around... show me your back.
- I've been pulled across

43:03.451 --> 43:06.273
from a different universe because
every single universe is in danger.

43:06.373 --> 43:08.708
There's something on your back.

43:09.058 --> 43:11.842
- What am I supposed to do?!
- Powering up...

43:12.650 --> 43:15.671
None of this... was meant to happen.
You're going to die.
