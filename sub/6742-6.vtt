01:50.043 --> 01:52.446
- Joe.
- * Pretty teeth, dear *

01:53.547 --> 01:54.382
Sieg heil.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.916
Sieg heil.
Glad you could make it.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.452
Saw you in the parade on TV.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.354
- It was really something.
- Oh, yes, it was.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.822
Hey, Harry.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.858
- Sieg heil.
- Sieg heil.

Honey, Joe's here.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.204
Hi, Joe.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.605
My wife Helen.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.207
I'm so glad
you could join us.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.574
Thank you for
inviting me, ma'am.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.378
I'm not your mother.
You can call me Helen.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.279
Kids?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.814
Girl: Yes, Mother.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.115
Oh, these are for you.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.584
Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.619
Oh.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.888
Joe, this is Thomas
and Amy and Jennifer.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.457
Hi, guys. Sieg heil.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.392
- Sieg heil.
- Hi.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.060
You forgot
our fourth again.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.762
This is Max.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.964
Hey, buddy.
I always wanted a dog.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.899
Max is very much
part of the family.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.901
It's what VA Day's
all about.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.570
You make yourself
at home, Joe.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.240
Come on, Joe. I'll
show you around.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.072
Hey.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.707
Hey.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.277
I was trying not to wake you.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.712
I didn't know
if you got much sleep.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.449
No, I was, uh, I was
looking at drawings,
you know.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.786
How was the memorial?

03:42.189 --> 03:43.824
It was fake.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.698
You look nice.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.366
Thanks.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.468
We should spend
some time together.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.137
I don't want to make you
late for the dojo.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.739
How about dinner?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.008
Yeah.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.315
Was that the phone before?

04:07.315 --> 04:09.917
Yeah. It was the wrong number.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.719
I'll see you later.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.630
Embarrassing, right?

04:22.696 --> 04:25.699
[chuckling]
Hey, don't knock it.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.503
So your dad doesn't mind
you being in here?

04:29.570 --> 04:32.340
He trusts us
to be responsible.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.773
[rifle cocks]

05:05.839 --> 05:07.708
Hey, Joe.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.079
Dad collects them.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.048
He likes to hunt.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.384
I guess that's security cover.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.586
Come on.
I'll show you outside.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.155
- Want to play catch?
- Sure.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.691
So how'd you get to be
working with my dad?

05:57.758 --> 06:00.428
He decided
to give me a shot.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.596
Just lucky, I guess.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.498
Where'd you go to college?

06:04.565 --> 06:07.000
Uh, I went straight to work.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.569
In the SS?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.038
In a factory.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.142
But you were
in the Hitler Youth.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.644
Sure.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.480
Right up until
they kicked me out.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.017
You want to join the SS?

06:24.084 --> 06:27.254
There are so many things
I'd like to do,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.757
places I'd like to go.

06:29.823 --> 06:30.824
But sure.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.893
I want to make
my country proud.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.761
And your dad, right?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.129
Smith:
What's this?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.666
You've been keeping
the secrets from me, Joe.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.569
You never told me
your middle name
was di Maggio.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.473
Didn't know you were
a baseball fan, sir.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.574
Well, once.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.208
It's a lazy sport

06:48.275 --> 06:51.144
compared to track or soccer.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.548
I got to pick up Helen's
mother from the airport.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.850
Okay.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.653
Actually, this is
where you offer

06:59.720 --> 07:01.121
to ride along with me,

07:01.188 --> 07:02.490
help draw
some of her fire.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.691
Right. Sorry.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.094
Hey, Dad, come on.
Throw it here.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.631
No such thing
as a free lunch, Joe.

I'm Juliana Crain.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.883
Kotomichi.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.602
Only speak
to the Trade Minister
when he speaks to you.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.558
Hello again, Miss Crain.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.561
I am Trade Minister Tagomi.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.700
The Trade Department has
many Aryan visitors.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.635
Often they feel
more comfortable

08:21.702 --> 08:23.904
if they are greeted by
an agreeable white face.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.739
The more comfortable
they feel,

08:25.806 --> 08:27.340
the easier it is
to do business.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.910
Your job will be
to serve tea,

08:29.977 --> 08:32.746
fill water glasses,
and smile politely
at all times.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.816
You're giving me a job?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.118
That is why you were
here yesterday,

08:38.185 --> 08:39.152
isn't it?

08:41.789 --> 08:42.723
Yes.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.726
I got the details
from Mr. Eto.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.430
There is an opening here

08:50.497 --> 08:52.600
if you so wish,
Miss Crain.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.603
Hai.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.971
Arigato.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.640
Mr. Tagomi expects

08:59.707 --> 09:01.341
complete loyalty
and discretion.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.644
You will not speak
of anything you hear or see,

09:03.711 --> 09:05.012
and you will not
leave this level

09:05.078 --> 09:06.680
without
my express permission.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.782
This is a government
building, Miss Crain,

09:08.849 --> 09:10.684
patrolled
by armed soldiers.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.320
Do not go anywhere
without prior authorization.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.321
[elevator door dings]

09:28.101 --> 09:30.037
You contacted the Trade
Minister's office?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.372
Yes, sir.
They're expecting you.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.976
You have read the preliminary
ballistics report, Inspector?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.344
Inconclusive.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.547
The man and boy
who described

09:40.648 --> 09:42.182
the bespectacled
gunman in the crowd

09:42.249 --> 09:44.652
believe this resembles
the weapon they saw.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.688
Compile a list
of antique dealers

09:47.755 --> 09:49.890
with a permit
to sell firearms.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.830
[knock on door]

09:59.733 --> 10:01.635
Frank,
I'm glad I caught you.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.270
I'm kind of late for work.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.606
Oh, yeah. I just finished.
Night shift.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.775
Oh, yeah?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.342
I just thought
I'd stop in

10:09.409 --> 10:10.944
on the way home.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.580
So, uh, Juliana,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.215
she came by yesterday.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.856
Frank, I never did say
I'm sorry for...

10:24.124 --> 10:25.625
what happened.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.731
That's uh, that's kind
of you, Arnold.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.967
Anne already passed on
your regards.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.806
So what is it really?
Juliana?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.409
She wasn't herself,
Frank.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.778
You know, she only stayed
for five minutes.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.479
Her mind was clearly
somewhere else.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.848
Now, if her sister
was around,

10:47.915 --> 10:49.082
I wouldn't worry,
but I--

10:49.149 --> 10:50.417
Well maybe Juliana
doesn't need us

10:50.483 --> 10:52.419
to worry about her as much
as we think she does.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.022
But, Frank, we're--

10:55.088 --> 10:56.890
we're the type of guys
who worry,

10:56.957 --> 10:59.659
whether people
need us to or not.

10:59.727 --> 11:03.831
We stand quietly
in the back,

11:03.897 --> 11:07.034
and we make the hard
decisions if we have to.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.804
You're a good guy.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.007
I'm glad Jules
can count on you.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.145
I'm glad that you can count
on each other, you know?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.884
Okay. I'm going to go.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.053
I'll see you later.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.824
[airplane soars]

11:30.891 --> 11:34.094
** [lively]

11:38.298 --> 11:40.934
There she is!

11:44.604 --> 11:48.008
** ["Runnin' Wild"]

11:53.513 --> 11:55.849
- Bad news, sir?
- For Helen.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.485
They canceled
her mother's flight.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.254
I think the rest of us will
get over it pretty quickly.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.796
Rudolph?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.297
Rudolph Wegener.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.868
Hello, John. Sieg heil.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.237
Sieg heil.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.374
What are you doing here?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.642
Trying to leave.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.078
Connecting flights to Berlin
have been delayed for hours.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.447
Now they're saying it could
be some time tonight.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.182
So where you been?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.151
On assignment
in the Pacific States.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.052
Uh-huh.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.453
I was already
marooned there

12:33.520 --> 12:35.655
due to the security
situation.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.125
Any word
on the Crown Prince?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.093
They're saying he survived.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.862
The FÃ¼hrer
will be relieved.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.397
It's a day
to count blessings.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.266
Speaking of which,

12:46.333 --> 12:49.269
my mother-in-law's flight
has also been affected.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.371
We have a spare seat
at our table.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.705
Oh, no, John, I--

12:52.840 --> 12:54.541
Oh, why not?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.209
How long since we
saw each other?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.145
- Nonetheless--
- 15 years?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.113
It's VA Day.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.215
I insist.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.285
Just like the old days,

13:05.352 --> 13:07.654
being bullied
by ScharfÃ¼hrer Smith.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.156
What do you say?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.658
Thank you.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.261
I'm sorry.
This is Joe Blake.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.863
Rudolph Wegener.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.933
An old colleague,
close friend.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.668
Good to meet you, sir.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.871
Rudolph. Likewise.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.472
Let's get you fed.

13:31.678 --> 13:35.482
We are particularly concerned
on behalf of Mr. Matsuni,

13:35.548 --> 13:38.886
given the scope of his
automotive operation

13:38.919 --> 13:41.721
and the importance
to the economy.

13:41.788 --> 13:44.191
But before we wade too deeply

13:44.257 --> 13:46.426
into the somewhat
choppy waters

13:46.493 --> 13:48.495
of piracy in
the south China Sea,

13:48.561 --> 13:51.064
may I ask, Trade Minister,
how is the Crown Prince?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.600
Very kind of you
to ask, Ambassador.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.237
As for my part,
please excuse me

13:57.304 --> 14:00.173
for forgetting
to congratulate you
on VA Day.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.775
Very gracious of you,
Minister Tagomi.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.312
Particularly since
the Pacific States

14:05.378 --> 14:08.015
choose to not formally
mark the occasion.

14:08.081 --> 14:12.385
We celebrate our
shared victory fully

14:12.452 --> 14:13.686
on Army Navy Day.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.122
And I'm delighted to say,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.823
since we are
among friends,

14:16.924 --> 14:20.427
that His Highness
the Crown Prince

14:20.493 --> 14:23.430
will lead those
celebrations in Tokyo.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.698
I saw him
first thing this morning.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.001
He looked remarkably well.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.038
And what of
the investigation,
Trade Minister?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.605
How is it progressing?

14:32.672 --> 14:37.277
That discussion is not
for this room, OberfÃ¼hrer.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.980
If you will all
turn to page 2

14:40.047 --> 14:42.382
of the Trade Security's
discussion document.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.726
Does life in Berlin
still suit you, Rudolph?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.495
Hmm. Yes.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.397
Except for the politics.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.800
Whispers about the future
of the Reich

15:00.968 --> 15:03.303
and its leadership
grow louder by the day.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.238
And I grow pessimistic,
I'm afraid.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.307
I think that's called
getting old, my friend.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.143
Perhaps. The thirst for power

15:10.210 --> 15:12.679
brings out the worst
in some of our comrades.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.782
What about here?

15:15.848 --> 15:17.517
Heydrich reports

15:17.584 --> 15:21.054
that you continue
to keep order

15:21.121 --> 15:22.589
with effortless efficiency.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.858
Nothing is without effort.
You know that, Rudolph.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.295
There are those
with short memories

15:28.361 --> 15:30.263
who seek to drag us
all backward.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.701
I thought insurgency had
all but been eradicated.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.737
Those with strong hearts
and soft heads have not.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.807
Ask Joe. He spent
most of last week

15:40.873 --> 15:42.375
tracking the Resistance

15:42.442 --> 15:44.711
in a covert mission
in the Neutral Zone.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.279
Successful, Joe?

15:48.181 --> 15:50.050
I learned a lot.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.452
Hmm. You're lucky.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.422
You couldn't hope for
a finer mentor than John.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.559
[door opens]

15:59.626 --> 16:01.261
Helen?

16:01.328 --> 16:03.663
I bring an old friend
from the Fatherland.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.864
Hi.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.533
You remember
Rudolph.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.268
Please stop
using the word "old"

16:08.335 --> 16:10.037
when you introduce me.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.338
[chuckling]

16:11.404 --> 16:13.373
I believe we met a few
times in Cincinnati.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.276
I never forget
a beautiful woman.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.710
It's good to see you again.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.679
I'm a poor substitute
for your mother,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.081
but I did
manage to stop off

16:21.148 --> 16:22.915
and pick up
a formidable Riesling.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.717
Oh. Well, then you can stay.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.818
Thank you.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.154
Come meet the family,

16:27.220 --> 16:28.355
and lunch is almost ready.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.057
Okay.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.469
[dialing]

16:48.475 --> 16:50.543
[ring]

16:50.610 --> 16:51.678
[ring]

16:53.746 --> 16:55.282
[ring]

16:56.983 --> 16:57.917
Hello.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.087
Uh, Mrs. Kasoura?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.354
Yes?

17:01.421 --> 17:04.091
Konnichiwa.
It's Mr. Childan.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.960
From American
Artistic Handcrafts?

17:08.095 --> 17:09.562
Yes?

17:09.629 --> 17:11.264
Yes. Uh, how are you?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
I'm fine, thank you.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.368
Um, you had asked me

17:15.435 --> 17:18.105
to advise you
of any new pieces

17:18.105 --> 17:19.606
that might be of interest,

17:19.672 --> 17:21.641
and I've come across
one or two things, so

17:21.708 --> 17:24.311
when do you think you might
be able to visit the shop?

17:27.214 --> 17:28.615
I'm not sure.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.184
Um, I will need to check
with my husband.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.985
[speaking Japanese]
Of course. Certainly.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.154
I just-- I--

17:34.221 --> 17:35.988
I would hate
for you to miss out.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.224
[door opens]

17:41.661 --> 17:43.996
Uh, I'll call you back.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.299
[click, dial tone]

17:50.370 --> 17:52.038
[speaking Japanese]

17:52.139 --> 17:53.473
Chief Inspector Kido.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.475
You have a special permit
to sell firearms.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.744
I would like to see
your sales ledger now.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.312
Of course.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.448
[speaking Japanese]
Certainly.

18:04.317 --> 18:07.154
Have you sold any late
19th century revolvers

18:07.220 --> 18:09.156
recently, Mr. Childan?

18:09.189 --> 18:12.159
Uh, no, sir.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
It is not an area
of specialization
for me.

18:14.661 --> 18:18.698
I normally
deal with pre-19th
century armaments.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.038
.45 caliber bullets times 3.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.708
Sold three days ago.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.449
Do you recall
this transaction?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
Oh, hai, of course.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.421
Uh, Mr. Satoshi Matsuda.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.591
Satoshi Matsuda?
He is Japanese?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.826
Oh, hai, hai,
as the law demands.

18:46.893 --> 18:50.263
Uh, in fact,
the vast majority of my
customers are Japanese,

18:50.330 --> 18:51.531
many of them placed.

18:51.598 --> 18:54.767
Which gun would these
bullets fit?

18:56.903 --> 18:58.205
Truthfully, Inspector,

18:58.238 --> 19:00.207
it's not my area
of expertise.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.574
Easy to check.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.842
And the address.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.515
Matsuda resides in Tibet?

19:08.581 --> 19:11.484
He was passing through,
I believe.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.457
Sergeant,
you have been to Tibet.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.692
I'm familiar
with it, sir.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.397
It's a small village,
quite remote.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.402
You are granted
a special license

19:29.469 --> 19:32.605
on condition that
the authorities are able

19:32.672 --> 19:35.742
to reach people who buy
prohibited items easily.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.611
Yes, sir, and I am
very sorry, truly,

19:38.678 --> 19:41.548
but Matsuda-san is
a trusted customer, uh--

19:41.614 --> 19:46.453
Who you trust is of no
consequence, Mr. Childan,

19:46.519 --> 19:49.256
whereas who I trust...

19:50.457 --> 19:52.659
that is of every
consequence.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.726
You understand?

19:55.495 --> 19:58.298
I do, sir. Hai.
Very much so.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.473
** [classical violin, piano]

20:11.511 --> 20:13.646
[laughing] Let me get this
straight, Rudolph.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.981
He stole them?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.249
I did not steal a boat.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.251
I temporarily
misplaced my own boat,

20:18.318 --> 20:19.419
and I took
another boat that--

20:19.486 --> 20:21.087
that belonged
to someone else,

20:21.153 --> 20:22.289
which looked very similar.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.523
A hovercraft would have
looked similar

20:23.590 --> 20:24.924
after all we had drunk.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.227
And I can't have one glass
of wine on VA Day?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.965
All right, under
the strict understanding

20:33.032 --> 20:35.668
that this goes no further
after today.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.205
- [children giggle]
- No.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.708
- Want a drink?
- Wegener: No.

20:43.476 --> 20:47.013
This is truly
a wonderful meal, Helen.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.849
To the most important
job in the Reich.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.463
I hope you find yourself
a good woman, Joe.

21:04.897 --> 21:05.765
And until then,

21:05.832 --> 21:08.401
find as many bad ones
as possible.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.836
[laughter]

21:11.471 --> 21:13.940
Are you married, Rudolph?
I noticed your ring.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.678
Married, but we spend
a lot of time apart.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.348
I try and see my children
as much as possible.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.949
You remember Catherine.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.420
You're still sailing,
I trust.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.122
No.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.558
What?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.760
I assumed that's why
you lived on an island.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.228
You spent as much time
on the Ohio river

21:36.363 --> 21:37.764
as you did on dry land.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.500
I-- I-- I stopped

21:40.567 --> 21:42.735
right about the time
I left Cincinnati.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.276
I hope you all saved
room for apple pie.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.844
Yeah?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.159
Hey, does the phrase "To life"
means anything to you?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.596
No. Why?

22:31.884 --> 22:34.887
Uh, I need you to check over
some employee details

22:34.954 --> 22:36.122
for you, Frank.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.028
Can I ask why,
Mr. Wyndam-Matson?

22:44.497 --> 22:46.232
Because they've
been requested,

22:46.298 --> 22:48.801
so they need to be right.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.603
Requested? Why?

22:50.670 --> 22:53.606
It's not a question either
of us should be asking.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.207
Everything correct?

22:55.274 --> 22:56.308
Yeah.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.644
Good.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.179
Helen:
So is there a girl, Joe?

23:00.246 --> 23:01.548
Someone special?

23:01.614 --> 23:02.849
Oh, careful.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.017
Uh, no.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.287
Well, there is a--

23:08.354 --> 23:10.590
a girl, but it's--

23:10.657 --> 23:12.091
it's complicated.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.662
Well, nothing worth having
comes easy.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.330
You know, when John
and I first met,

23:18.465 --> 23:21.033
you wouldn't have given
us much of a chance.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.604
We had nothing.
We had less than nothing.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.206
His family started
with money,

23:27.273 --> 23:29.075
but then the Crash.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.679
You know, John believes

23:32.745 --> 23:34.481
that a man determines
his own worth.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.816
Looks like you've done
pretty well.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.386
You could have all this,
Joe.

23:40.487 --> 23:42.655
I see a lot of John
in you.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.794
It was-- It's, uh--

23:47.860 --> 23:51.063
It's been really great
being here.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.699
- Yes.
- Just, uh--

23:54.233 --> 23:55.568
It's been really great.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.739
You know, it's a long way
back to the city.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.774
Why don't you stay over?

24:01.841 --> 24:04.210
Oh, no. I wouldn't want
to put you to any trouble.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.978
Well, we have room.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.115
It's up to you.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.650
Smith:
It's coming!

Oh. It must be

Trade.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.072
Can't talk about it?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.611
I can talk to you
about anything, my friend.

24:38.678 --> 24:42.982
It just doesn't warrant
discussion. Routine.

24:46.553 --> 24:50.156
A long way to go for
a routine trade mission,

24:50.222 --> 24:53.726
especially when we have
senior people there.

Fellow citizens,

25:45.411 --> 25:49.616
I stand before you today
a proud man.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.251
On this day in 1947,

25:52.318 --> 25:55.187
two years after
the capitulation

25:55.254 --> 25:58.357
of the government of the
United States of America,

25:58.424 --> 26:02.161
the bloody struggle
to liberate America

26:02.228 --> 26:05.965
was finally and
comprehensibly won.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.244
Sakura Iwazaru.

26:23.750 --> 26:29.722
And on this day
our true quest began

26:29.789 --> 26:33.559
to make a proud
but demoralized people--

26:33.660 --> 26:36.562
Can we get some snacks,
maybe? Pretzels?

26:36.663 --> 26:37.930
Yeah.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.999
I'll go.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.669

of humankind.

...criminality,

What? Yes. I'm here

Uh, no. Actually,
maybe you can help.

You do remember me? Right?
From yesterday?

28:34.280 --> 28:37.549
I'm looking for someone,
someone who works here.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.319
The Trade Minister sent you
to get an employee file?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.854
Yeah.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.023
Well, no, not Mr. Tagomi
personally,

28:44.090 --> 28:45.257

28:45.324 --> 28:46.658
I should ask
since I was down here.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.195
I think
it's kind of urgent.

looking for is Iwazaru--

You're sure about that?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.192
It's a pretty common name.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.895
Who asked you to get it?
I can call--

29:22.962 --> 29:25.464
Uh, no, that's fine.
Don't. No need.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.733
Sounds like they're playing
a trick on the new girl.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.201
New white girl, maybe.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.524
Back to work.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.401
Rudolph Wegener.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.770
A senior Nazi from Berlin.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.772
And at some point yesterday,

30:06.839 --> 30:08.740
he vanished
from his hotel room.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.378
Well. Thank you for
informing me, Inspector.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.814
You had no suspicion?

30:15.882 --> 30:17.683
Of what?

30:17.749 --> 30:20.219
The high-ranking Nazi
insinuated his way

30:20.286 --> 30:22.889
into the center of our
Crown Prince's visit,

30:22.955 --> 30:25.557
a visit during which
His Highness was shot.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.326
He was on the same podium.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.862
I did not come with
accusations, Minister.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.199
At this stage,
only suspicion.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.502
Do you have any idea

30:36.568 --> 30:40.306
how or why Colonel Wegener
fled from his hotel?

30:40.372 --> 30:44.043
I'm sure that there's
an innocent explanation.

30:46.112 --> 30:49.215
Yesterday you issued
a diplomatic visa.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.883
Yes, I did.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.319
May I ask who to?

30:53.385 --> 30:56.355
You may, but I believe
all you need to know

30:56.422 --> 31:00.993
is that it wasn't Mr. Baynes
or your Colonel Wegener.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.333
I will need you to share
everything you have on this man

31:07.399 --> 31:08.734
with my office.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.170
Yes, of course.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.542
Thank you for your
cooperation, Trade Minister.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.957
** ["FÃ¼r Elise"]

31:30.957 --> 31:32.758
Smith:
...drinking nothing but
Polish vodka.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.360
Have you ever had
Polish vodka?

31:34.426 --> 31:35.661
It's not good.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.297
Thank you, son.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.309
I think this
occasion calls for

31:50.376 --> 31:52.011
the really good stuff,
gentlemen.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.818
I've never been to the
Pacific States, Rudolph.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.988
What are people
doing there today?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.155
Business as usual.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.757
They don't celebrate VA Day.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.459
- Really?
- Hmm.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.561
I thought the FÃ¼hrer
made them honorary Aryans.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.165
It doesn't mean they value
their people, Joe.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.102
Here the worker is honored,

32:16.168 --> 32:18.337
not a means to an end.

32:18.404 --> 32:22.708
There's a great deal to admire
about the Japanese, Joe,

32:22.774 --> 32:25.011
not least their work ethic.

32:25.011 --> 32:28.114
There's no shortage
of admiration as far as
your concerned, Rudolph.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.049
I simply agree
with the FÃ¼hrer.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.318
Continued peaceful
relations with Tokyo

32:32.384 --> 32:34.553
is in everybody's
interest.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.556
You have a family now, John.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.560
Surely you agree that we must
do whatever it takes

32:41.627 --> 32:42.694
to avoid war.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.798
Perhaps.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.435
Some wars are necessary.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.237
We fought in one.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.072
And you still believe

32:53.139 --> 32:56.042
that everything we did
back then

32:56.075 --> 32:58.044
was necessary?

33:03.582 --> 33:05.751
You wait till you see
Berlin, Joe.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.119
The scale of--

33:07.186 --> 33:08.654
You know what nobody
talks about

33:08.720 --> 33:10.689
on VA Day, Joe?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.724
Nobody talks
about the camps.

33:12.791 --> 33:16.262
Nobody talks about
how many we exterminated.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.064
We got commendations
for it.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.731
[chuckling]

33:19.798 --> 33:21.333
But nobody talks about it.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.402
What's there to say,
Rudolph?

33:25.137 --> 33:28.074
It was necessary work.
We did it.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.109
In war as in life, Joe,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.444
sacrifices
have to be made.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.346
You never
think about it, John?

33:34.413 --> 33:35.547
I prefer to look forward.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.749
- That's not what I asked.
- Rudy.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.188
This is beneath you.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.990
When you went out
sailing on your boat

33:45.091 --> 33:47.326
all those nights,
alone but for a bottle--

33:47.393 --> 33:49.861
I was trying to find
some perspective.

33:49.928 --> 33:53.099
And yet you no longer sail.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.201
Why is that?

34:03.109 --> 34:06.578
Well, at least now
we have better whiskey.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.615
Now we have
a better world.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.588
Ahem. Sieg heil.

34:19.658 --> 34:20.992
Sieg heil.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.728
Sieg heil.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.245
Miss Crain,

34:39.311 --> 34:41.947
Mr. Tagomi would like
to talk with you

34:42.013 --> 34:43.549
privately.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.556
[knock on door]

34:58.264 --> 35:00.065
Konnichiwa, Mr. Frink.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.800
What do you want?

35:01.867 --> 35:04.336
I was visited
by the Kempeitai today.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.205
They have
a particular interest

35:06.272 --> 35:08.707
in antique firearms
and ammunition.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.178
I don't need to know what you
did with those bullets--

35:12.244 --> 35:13.345
Yeah,
I didn't do anything.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.780
I'm no fool, Mr. Frink.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.082
Do not make the mistake
of underestimating me.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.551
I didn't do anything,
and I'm busy right now.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.552
So please leave.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.953
I simply
need your assurance

35:22.020 --> 35:23.189
that they won't be found.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.456
If official inquiries
come to nothing,

35:24.523 --> 35:26.225
the only way this gets
back to me is through you.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.859
I just asked you
to get out, okay?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.428
And I warn you
I will not die

35:29.495 --> 35:31.363
as the result
of gaijin stupidity.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.066
And don't underestimate
me, either,

35:35.201 --> 35:37.203
you fucking
Nip-loving prick!

35:37.236 --> 35:39.205
I talk, and we both die,

35:39.205 --> 35:41.240
and believe me, you've
got a lot more to lose

35:41.307 --> 35:42.741
than me right now.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.112
We seem to have no choice

35:47.213 --> 35:49.781
but to trust each other,
Mr. Frink.

36:10.336 --> 36:13.305
Miss Crain,
I won't keep you long.

36:13.372 --> 36:17.909
I merely want to thank you
for your diligence today.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.246
The cultures
we were born into

36:20.279 --> 36:23.615
mean that we do things
differently.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.752
And yet I suspect
that we also hold

36:26.818 --> 36:30.922
many of the same things
in the highest esteem.

36:32.991 --> 36:38.063
You've seen we don't have
many white faces here.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.466
It will be assumed
by your appointment

36:40.532 --> 36:42.768
that you can be
depended upon.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.538
Trust--

36:46.605 --> 36:48.774
very important to me,
Miss Crain.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.911
I understand, Mr. Tagomi.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.688
Uh--

37:05.090 --> 37:09.094
Aikido teaches
the significance of reaction,

37:09.160 --> 37:10.896
reading an opponent's
intentions

37:10.962 --> 37:12.764
through physical response.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.367
OberfÃ¼hrer Diels,

37:15.434 --> 37:16.635
at the meeting today,

37:16.702 --> 37:19.971
kept touching his throat
when he spoke.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.441
I do the same thing
sometimes

37:22.508 --> 37:24.876
when I'm trying
to hide something.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.951
Aikido is a noble pursuit.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.321
Good evening, Miss Crain.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.903
I'm sorry.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.004
Frank.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.476
I'm so sorry.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.345
I got held up.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.983
This looks beautiful.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.055
I called your mother

38:10.121 --> 38:11.690
to see
if you were there.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.191
Then I, uh,

38:13.258 --> 38:16.695
then, uh,
then I called the dojo.

38:16.762 --> 38:17.929
Okay, Frank--

38:17.996 --> 38:20.366
Okay, whatever you do,
don't say sorry again.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.374
I didn't want to put you
in more danger.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.610
It's about the films, Frank.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.881
I'm not giving up on this.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.018
- I can't.
- No. No, no, no.

38:40.085 --> 38:41.587
- No. Don't do that.
- If I stop now,

38:41.653 --> 38:43.121
I betray everyone
we've lost, Frank.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.390
This is me
you're talking to,

38:44.390 --> 38:45.657
the guy who pulled you
off that street

38:45.724 --> 38:47.759
all busted up.
It's not about them.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.595
Yeah, it's-- it's--
it's about you.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.397
That is not true.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.731
And why even mention
the accident?

38:52.798 --> 38:56.001
How can you still not see
what you've done?

38:56.067 --> 38:58.069
You know?

38:58.136 --> 38:59.405
You know what? I--

38:59.471 --> 39:01.907
I didn't ask for any
of this, Juliana.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.108
I was happy.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.211
How happy?

39:06.277 --> 39:07.779
Huh?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.114
I was happy.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.649
Yeah.

39:10.716 --> 39:13.785
We were only ever as happy
as they allowed us to be.

39:16.087 --> 39:20.125
Frank, what if there's--
what if it's true?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.493
What if there's
a way out, Frank?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.728
- What if there is?
- Yeah, well, what--

39:22.794 --> 39:24.162
For you, for me,
for everyone?

39:24.229 --> 39:25.564
What makes you think
you wouldn't lie

39:25.631 --> 39:27.065
to everyone there, too?

39:27.132 --> 39:28.800
I didn't ask for this,
either, Frank.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.235
- Come on!
- Fine. Fine.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.303
But just so you know,
I am not that guy

39:32.438 --> 39:34.606
who found you
on the street anymore.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.575
Where in the fuck
have you been?

39:37.709 --> 39:40.612
What have you been doing,
Juliana?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.482
I got a job.

39:46.452 --> 39:47.553
What?

39:49.455 --> 39:51.857
At the Nippon.

39:54.593 --> 39:55.794
You're working
for the government?

39:55.861 --> 39:58.096
- For Trudy.
- They killed Trudy.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.669
Wow.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.607
You know, they took my, uh,

40:08.674 --> 40:10.809
they took my sister...

40:12.243 --> 40:14.980
my niece, my nephew...

40:16.081 --> 40:17.148
and now you.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.584
God damn it, Frank!

40:18.650 --> 40:20.285
Whatever happened
and whoever's to blame,

40:20.351 --> 40:21.753
I can't unsee that film
any more

40:21.820 --> 40:23.722
than I can unkill
that man in Canon City.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.725
What did you say?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.000
You killed someone?

40:35.066 --> 40:37.035
- Okay.
- Who?

40:41.206 --> 40:42.608
There was a--

40:43.742 --> 40:45.944
a Nazi agent who--

40:47.713 --> 40:49.447
who tried to kill me.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.085
And, uh, someone--

40:54.152 --> 40:57.556
someone from the East Coast
Resistance helped me.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.390
East Coast Resistance?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.692
A man?

41:00.759 --> 41:02.528
Oh, come on, Frank.
What difference--

41:02.594 --> 41:04.095
- Was he a man?
- Does it matter, Frank?

41:04.162 --> 41:05.897
Was he a fucking man?

41:07.165 --> 41:09.167
Get the fuck away from me.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.902
Frank.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.237
Frank!

41:12.303 --> 41:14.005
There's a curfew, Frank.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.718
[clatter]

41:43.234 --> 41:44.770
[sighs]

41:48.574 --> 41:49.841
Is everything all right, sir?

41:54.045 --> 41:56.582
Helen tells me
you're staying the night.

41:58.449 --> 41:59.751
Is that okay?

41:59.818 --> 42:00.852
Yeah.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.159
Hey, tell me.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.130
What do you make of Rudolph?

42:14.866 --> 42:17.603
He seems like a good man.

42:18.503 --> 42:19.771
Why?

42:22.173 --> 42:23.742
He's lying.

42:23.809 --> 42:28.914
There was no trade assignment
in the Pacific States.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.283
He was identified
on a diplomatic ticket.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.985
Gave a false name.

42:35.821 --> 42:38.223
Rudolph's flight
wasn't delayed.

42:39.324 --> 42:41.292
He was.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.265
So you've known all day?

42:47.332 --> 42:48.700
Yeah.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.470
What about Helen's mother?

42:52.537 --> 42:55.807
Dead two years.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.676
She was a great lady.

42:59.711 --> 43:03.481
I felt certain that he
would confide in me

43:03.548 --> 43:05.784
at some point today.

43:05.851 --> 43:08.920
Maybe I don't know people
as well as I think.

43:14.392 --> 43:16.928
So Helen knew about Rudolph.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.667
You must trust
the woman in your life

43:21.733 --> 43:23.368
with your life, Joe.

43:25.203 --> 43:29.307
And the less you knew,
the less he'd suspect.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.211
Are you going to question him?

43:35.681 --> 43:37.082
Me and Rudolph, we--

43:37.148 --> 43:42.888
we performed duties
together that--

43:43.755 --> 43:45.390
bond men.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.294
They bond men forever.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.130
I have no objectivity here.

43:52.197 --> 43:54.399
My heart tells me
he's a good man.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.034
He's a--
He's a brave man who--

43:56.101 --> 43:59.204
who must have
good reason for...

43:59.270 --> 44:02.007
betraying his people.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.942
But my head?

44:04.009 --> 44:06.344
My head says we should
take him out in the woods,

44:06.411 --> 44:09.047
interrogate him,
shoot him in the fucking face.

44:12.617 --> 44:15.553
How do you justify this, Joe?

44:15.620 --> 44:18.556
He's lied all day in my home.

44:18.623 --> 44:22.627
Enjoyed
my family's hospitality.

44:22.728 --> 44:23.862
You tell me.

44:23.929 --> 44:27.565
I'm asking for your counsel.

44:27.632 --> 44:30.201
What would you do?

44:32.570 --> 44:34.239
[horn honks]

44:34.305 --> 44:35.807
Oh, my taxi.

44:37.743 --> 44:39.010
Thank you.

44:41.446 --> 44:43.114
Good night.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.251
John, Joe,

44:46.317 --> 44:48.419
a real pleasure.

44:48.486 --> 44:50.155
For me, too, Rudolph.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.296
I wish we hadn't
left it so long.

45:17.382 --> 45:20.085
You always were
too smart for me, John.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.506
You were right, Joe.

45:44.442 --> 45:48.179
Emotions can't be
allowed to interfere
with what is right.

45:50.849 --> 45:53.184
And sacrifices
have to be made.

46:35.961 --> 46:37.562
[speaking Japanese]

46:50.608 --> 46:52.110
What the hell
are you doing?

46:52.177 --> 46:54.880
The meeting room
on the trade floor

46:54.880 --> 46:57.115
is called Bara--
rose.

46:57.182 --> 46:58.950
- Right?
- You can't be here.

46:59.017 --> 47:00.218
Sakura
means cherry blossom.

47:00.285 --> 47:02.187
Did you hear me?
You have to go.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.889
Listen, I think
Sakura is a room

47:03.889 --> 47:05.656
somewhere in this building,
and I need to find it.

47:05.723 --> 47:07.225
I don't know what it is
you're doing.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.759
I need a floor plan,
Christine.

47:08.894 --> 47:11.262
Or why you think
you can come to me,
but I need this job.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.264
I promise this will
never get back to you.

47:13.331 --> 47:16.067
But the next time that bastard
demands personal services,

47:16.134 --> 47:18.469
at least you'll know you
screwed him a little, too.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.088
[knock on door]

47:43.228 --> 47:47.265
I-- I, uh-- I didn't know
where else to go.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.514
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have come here.

48:03.581 --> 48:04.983
But you did.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.020
You did, Frank.

48:09.955 --> 48:12.690
"To life."
Why did you say that?

48:12.757 --> 48:14.092
Why?

48:14.159 --> 48:16.127
Well, why do you think?

48:21.967 --> 48:25.370
I think I remember
hearing it as a kid.

48:28.673 --> 48:30.608
My grandfather, maybe.

48:30.675 --> 48:32.810
Yeah.

48:32.877 --> 48:33.979
I'm not Jewish.

48:34.045 --> 48:35.580
[chuckle]

48:35.646 --> 48:36.982
That's okay.

48:37.015 --> 48:39.317
We won't hold it against you.

48:40.051 --> 48:42.620
It's okay.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.889
Frank, this is Charlie,
Clara.

48:44.990 --> 48:47.092
Kids, this is Frank.

48:53.131 --> 48:55.366
Yeah, it's the three
of us now.

48:59.004 --> 49:01.172
Losing people is one thing.

49:01.239 --> 49:05.176
Not being allowed to grieve
for them, it's, uh...

49:05.243 --> 49:07.378
well, that's another.

49:10.115 --> 49:13.118
Frank, would you mind
if-- if we said a prayer--

49:13.184 --> 49:15.020
uh, the kids and me--

49:15.886 --> 49:18.556
for Laura and John and Emily?

50:21.119 --> 50:23.488
[saying Kaddish in Hebrew]

50:24.755 --> 50:26.057
- Amen.
- Amen.

50:26.124 --> 50:30.061
[continuing]

50:47.845 --> 50:49.280
Clara, Charlie: Amen.

50:50.548 --> 50:54.285
[various voices chattering]

50:58.256 --> 51:01.426
[voices continue]

51:03.428 --> 51:05.430
[Kaddish continues]

51:10.535 --> 51:12.503
[various voices continue]

51:12.570 --> 51:14.239
Man:
Heard the Crown Prince
isn't gonna make it.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.241
Got to be the Nazis.

51:16.307 --> 51:19.577
[voices continue]

51:25.883 --> 51:27.552
[Kaddish continues]

51:52.743 --> 51:53.744
Clara, Charlie: Amen.

52:06.257 --> 52:08.226
[Kaddish continues]

52:15.566 --> 52:16.767
Amen.

52:42.227 --> 52:44.762
[Kaddish continues]

52:51.669 --> 52:52.870
Amen.

52:57.542 --> 52:58.776
Amen.
