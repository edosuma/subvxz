00:02.770 --> 00:05.404
- Of course, we have
this Angelina and Mike drama.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.873
- Our drama is not over.

00:07.942 --> 00:08.941
- How are you gonna
do the reveal?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.075
- We have no idea.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.777
- This guy wants
to do this gender reveal.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.479
- Operation jump
out of a plane.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.513
- Stop it!

00:14.582 --> 00:15.814
<i> - I'm so drunk.</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:18.617

00:31.465 --> 00:33.699
<i> - On the seventh day,</i>

00:54.588 --> 00:55.621
Come on, girl.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.689
I was so busy
with running around,

00:57.758 --> 00:59.658
<i> sports stuff, my store,</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:01.193
<i> that I got</i>
<i> the frickin' date wrong.</i>

01:01.262 --> 01:02.795
I have to poop really bad.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.263
I feel like
a complete asshole...

01:04.331 --> 01:05.664
Is this the right way?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.733
Because I'm the one
that missed the first full day.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.169
[sighs] I'm tired.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.740
- [gagging]

01:14.809 --> 01:16.842
I remember bits and pieces
from last night,

01:16.911 --> 01:19.611
but really nothing much.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.447
Every time I think
that I don't have

01:21.515 --> 01:23.649
any more left in me
to throw up,

01:23.717 --> 01:24.983
there's more that comes out...

01:25.052 --> 01:26.051
[gagging]

01:26.153 --> 01:27.052
And more that comes out.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.420
[gagging]

01:28.489 --> 01:29.888
[whimpers]

01:29.957 --> 01:31.990
- What the [bleep] is this?

01:32.059 --> 01:35.027
Oh, my little--
sweet little room.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.162
Crocodilly!

01:37.231 --> 01:39.064
Hi, Crocky.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.732
All right, I really have
to poop, so...

01:40.801 --> 01:41.900
[line trilling]

01:41.969 --> 01:44.336
- Yo, is this
the dancing chooch?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.337
<i> - Not anymore.</i>

01:45.406 --> 01:46.872
- Yes, you are.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.807
Still a dancer,
still a stripper.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.075
<i> Bro, we need to focus today.</i>

01:50.177 --> 01:51.710
<i> It's gender reveal time.</i>

01:51.779 --> 01:53.946
- Me and Pauly decided
today is the day

01:54.014 --> 01:55.614
of Mike's gender reveal.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.216
<i> He has no idea</i>
<i> what's about to happen,</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:59.218
but Mike will actually
jump out of a plane.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.285
- We gotta take the reins
on this.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.587
Do you remember
he said he wanted

02:01.655 --> 02:03.021
to jump out of a plane?
Why don't we do that?

02:03.090 --> 02:04.823
- He's gonna tell Lauren,
and Lauren's not gonna

02:04.892 --> 02:06.125
let him do it.
- Right.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.126
All right,
let's figure this out.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.293
I'm gonna come to you.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.328
- Friends?

02:09.396 --> 02:10.762
Where's my friends?

02:10.831 --> 02:11.763
Hello?

02:11.832 --> 02:12.865
Friends?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.767
Cool, there's no
[bleep] friends.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.603
Sick suite.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.738
Oh, you are creepy
as [bleep], sir.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.141
You're weird and freaky.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.142
Who is this man?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.610
I don't like your face.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.545
Mama's here, bitches!

02:26.614 --> 02:27.980
I don't like you.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.114
<i> - Hello?</i>

02:29.216 --> 02:31.383
- Deener!
<i> - Hey!</i>

02:31.452 --> 02:33.318
- I'm in the cast suite.
No one's here.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.753
<i> - I'll be right there.</i>
- OK.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.888
- Yo.
- Yo, what up?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.222
- Are you decent?
Ah, [bleep], you are.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.624
- Sorry to disappoint.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.626
- Um, what we gotta do, man,
we got to focus.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.728
- We cannot tell him,
because he's gonna tell Lauren.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.530
- She can't know. The other
girls can't even know either.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.065
- So we keep Lauren separate
from Mike today.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.300
- Yes.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.668
The only way this is gonna
actually work

02:49.737 --> 02:52.037
is if Mike gets up in the air
before Lauren finds out.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.038
She's not gonna let it go down.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.039
How do we distract the girls?

02:54.108 --> 02:55.040
- Alcohol.
- Wine.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.042
- Brunch.
- Yeah, they got mimosas.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.744
- They can do mimosas.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.045
- Ooh, we're sneaky.

03:00.114 --> 03:01.113
We got this.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.848
- We gotta figure out a way

03:02.917 --> 03:05.684
to get this [bleep] jumping
out of a plane.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.319
- Yes.
- But don't tell him

03:07.388 --> 03:08.720
that he's gonna jump
out of a plane.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.322
What are we gonna say,
let's go get breakfast?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.323
Like, we need to do...
- No.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.791
- Something that's, like, big.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.393
- Is there something--I know
they got pizza around here.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.595
- Mm-hmm. Let's look up, like,
Italian New Orleans food.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.298
- All right.
- Muffaletta sandwich.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.465
- It's a muffa-what-a?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.934
- Muffaletta.
- Muffa-who?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.435
What'd you just call me?
- Oh, you know the Muffalettas?

03:23.504 --> 03:24.670
- Oh, I know Muffaletta, he
used to live down the street.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.938
- Yeah, he lived
down the street.

03:26.006 --> 03:26.972
- Yeah, he owes me money.
- In Staten Island, yeah.

03:27.041 --> 03:27.940
- What the [bleep]
is a muffaletta?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.374
- Well, we gonna find out.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.410
I have no idea of what
a muffaletta sandwich is.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.712
<i> It sounds like one of</i>
<i> Angelina's future ex-husbands,</i>

03:33.781 --> 03:34.913
Chris Muffaletta.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.848
"A muffaletta
is a deli sandwich topped

03:36.917 --> 03:38.817
"with fresh olive salad,

03:38.886 --> 03:40.452
"browned Italian bread,

03:40.521 --> 03:41.853
salami..."
- Bro, it's an Italian--

03:41.922 --> 03:43.455
- "Mortadella..."
- It's an Italian sub.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.523
- What, are we
in Staten Island?

03:44.592 --> 03:45.991
- I'm with it.
- That looks bomb.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.426
We're gonna go eat
some Italian sandwiches.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.627
- Gonna go eat some muff.
- We're gonna--

03:48.696 --> 03:51.530
[laughs] We're gonna
go eat some muffalettas.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.664
- Girls are gonna
do their brunch.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.234
- Eventually,
Mike is gonna find out

03:55.302 --> 03:57.236
that he's jumping out
of an airplane.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.837
No big deal.
both: No big deal.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.205
- All right, so we'll do--throw
food in front of his face.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.907
He won't even think about it.
- This is too easy.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.175
- Hello?
- [gasps]

04:03.244 --> 04:04.309
Thank God!

04:04.378 --> 04:05.978
both: Mm.
- You look cute.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.179
I feel like
I have to go get ready.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.513
How was yesterday?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.048
- Ange was all over the place,

04:10.117 --> 04:11.850
still spiraling
about the Twitter.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.452
- Mike has been
coming at me on Twitter.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.520
He said I had--
I should have been a felon.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.923
- But then they were
in the car in the back,

04:17.992 --> 04:19.258
and one of them brought it up.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.392
And they weren't fighting.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.327
Jenni was the mediator
in the back.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.662
- Listen--
- Told her to come in positive.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.997
- No, she is--she is--no.
- I said, if you're being

04:25.065 --> 04:26.298
positive...
- I'm trying to be--

04:26.367 --> 04:27.733
- She'd be positive.
- I'm--I'm being positive.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.069
- I think another conversation
is gonna have to be had

04:31.138 --> 04:33.538
because it was, like,
in the car, and then it got,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.774
like, stopped short because
we got to the restaurant.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.510
- I don't want any drama
like San Diego.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.645
- To a cheater.
What?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.146
- I'm a cheater?
- Yeah, you are.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.147
- God forbid.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.715
Is Ange alive?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.651
- I don't know, actually.
Let me call her.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.754
<i> - Gold Coast Skydiving.</i>
- Hey, how you doing?

04:48.822 --> 04:52.124
I'm actually doing a big gender
reveal for a buddy of mine.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.293
We need for him
to jump out of a plane.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.161
<i> - All right, can we do,</i>

04:56.230 --> 04:58.230
<i> you know, detection smoke</i>
<i> from one of my guys.</i>

04:58.299 --> 04:59.798
- Actually,
that's a great idea.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.733
- Do you have pink smoke?
'Cause we all know it's a girl.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.035
Look, we all know it's a girl,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.870
but I still want to see
Mike jump out of a plane.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.104
<i> - We don't have the smoke.</i>

05:06.173 --> 05:07.572
<i> - Oh, damn,</i>
<i> I didn't realize that.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:09.274
I gotta figure
something else out here.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.209
- Yeah, and he's
a big boy too, so--

05:11.278 --> 05:12.477
- He's a big boy.
Is there a weight limit?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.680
- [laughs]
<i> - Hang on.</i>

05:14.748 --> 05:16.014
<i> Hang on now.</i>
<i> How big we talking now?</i>

05:16.083 --> 05:17.683
- Nah, not that big.
- Two...

05:17.751 --> 05:19.184
- He's, like, doughy.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.986
He has really small legs
though.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.054
- He's top-heavy.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.022
- Like, abnormally big biceps.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.158
<i> - So he's skipping leg day</i>
<i> kind of deal?</i>

05:26.226 --> 05:27.159
- Oh, yeah, every day.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.329
[laughing]

05:30.397 --> 05:31.496
We'll see you there.
- All right, we're gonna

05:31.565 --> 05:33.198
see you in a little bit.
Thank you so much.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.966
- She's probably not alive,
I'm telling you.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.234
<i> - Hello?</i>
- Oh!

05:36.303 --> 05:38.036
- [bleep], you sound horrible.
- Are you OK?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.005
- Ange, I'm here.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.107
- Who--Nicole?

05:42.176 --> 05:43.842
- Are you OK?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.644
- I've been hugging
the toilet bowl all day.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.678
- Me and Chris were--
- Aw.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.213
I think you were
Brenda last night.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.815
- At the end of the night,
you threw

05:49.883 --> 05:51.550
<i> Vinny's cake on the floor,</i>

05:51.618 --> 05:54.619
and then you were on your knees
squishing the cake.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.954
<i> - Wait, when?</i>

05:56.023 --> 05:57.689
- [gasps] She blacked out.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.091
- Whoo!

05:59.159 --> 06:00.158
- No, not funny.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.159
- [babbling]

06:01.228 --> 06:02.861
[laughter]

06:02.930 --> 06:04.730
- ♪ What a waste of cake ♪

06:04.798 --> 06:06.598
- Now I have
to [bleep] do this.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.533
- Bro, you're a weirdo.
- All right, well, get ready.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.868
- Get your [bleep] together.
I'm here.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.137
- We're going--
we're going out.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.138
Yikes.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.373
- Woof.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.507
<i> - Listen to this.</i>

06:15.576 --> 06:18.343
We have Zack and Chris.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.845
What I'm gonna tell them is,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.179
guys, here's what
I need you to do.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.281
Hang back.
I'm gonna text you an address

06:23.350 --> 06:24.282
to pick up a box.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.584
Don't ask what's in that box.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.619
Don't look what's in that box.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.454
- Because otherwise,
I'm gonna [bleep] kill you.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.223
- I'm gonna [bleep] kill you.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.292
Have Zack and Chris ever really
been put to the test?

06:34.361 --> 06:35.494
They play an essential role

06:35.562 --> 06:36.495
because you know
what's in that box, right?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.663
- Mm-mm.
- The smoke,

06:38.732 --> 06:39.965
the pink smoke.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.199
[laughter]

06:41.268 --> 06:42.868
So why not put them
to the test now?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.970
<i> I'm gonna tell them</i>
<i> to go see my guy</i>

06:45.038 --> 06:46.238
and don't ask any questions.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.573
I got a guy for them
to go see, that's it.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.608
See, I have a guy
for everything.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.742
<i> If they look in that box,</i>

06:50.811 --> 06:51.843
they're gonna see my other guy,

06:51.912 --> 06:53.011
the guy they don't want to see.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.346
- Knock, knock.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.614
- Come in, come in.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.815
- Chris and Zack have been
just kind of

06:56.884 --> 06:59.117
on the outskirts
of the circle of trust.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.919
- Draw that curtain, Vin.
- All right.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.354
- What's going on?
- What is happening?

07:02.423 --> 07:03.955
- Yeah, they got married
and engaged,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.057
and, you know,
Zack raises Jenni's kids,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.993
but this is the ultimate test.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.530
- Fellas, we got a little, uh,
project for you guys.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.031
- [deep voice] Yeah.
- I'm gonna

07:13.100 --> 07:14.299
text you an address.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.268
You're gonna pick
something up, OK?

07:16.336 --> 07:17.402
Don't ask me what it is.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.737
Don't ask me
who you're gonna see.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.272
Don't look in that box.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.807
And I'm gonna text you another
address of where to bring it.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.642
The thing is, you cannot
let your wives know.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.976
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't ask me any questions.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.845
- No speaking?
- And do not look in that b--

07:26.914 --> 07:28.346
what happens
if you look in that box?

07:28.415 --> 07:30.916
- We'll [bleep] kill you.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.552
- Meet this guy
in this unknown location

07:33.620 --> 07:35.720
and pick up
this unknown package.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.955
- For something important.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.757
- See this right here?

07:38.826 --> 07:41.460
This is the circle of trust.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.161
This is our family.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.563
This is you guys.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.864
- We're outside the circle?
- We're still outside

07:45.933 --> 07:47.365
of your trust.
- You're close to it, you know?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.834
You're, like,
creeping on the outside.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.036
But if you want to be inside
the circle of trust,

07:51.104 --> 07:52.404
you gotta complete this.
- Mmm. It's nice in there.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.405
It's nice and warm.
- Yeah.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.073
If Chris and Zack want to be

07:55.142 --> 07:56.208
in the circle of trust,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.543
they're gonna have
to do this mission

07:58.612 --> 08:00.245
because if they [bleep] around,
they're gonna find out.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.646
- Yeah, they're gonna
[bleep] around and find out.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.048
And you see that little circle?
You know where they are?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.616
Outside of it.
- Outside of the circle.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.884
We want you guys right here.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.385
- In the warm center.
- Can we count on you?

08:07.454 --> 08:09.120
- Yeah, for sure.
- Appreciate it, man.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.655
- I feel like
we're in a mob movie.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.191
- So do not let the wives know.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.926
- Don't let
the wives know what?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.127
- Exactly.
I like that answer.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.295
- Yeah.
- I like that.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.296
I like that.
- That's right.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.998
We are,
except we're on the side

08:20.067 --> 08:20.999
that doesn't end well.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.400
- Don't look in the box.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.569
both: We won't look in the box.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.972
- Trust.
- We'll take care of it.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.006
- Thank you.

<i> [smooth hip-hop music]</i>

08:29.643 --> 08:31.243

- I'm a little upset

08:31.311 --> 08:32.611
we're outside the circle.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.446
- [bleep] around, and...
both: You'll find out.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.481
- My wife is going to flip out.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.416
- If my husband's in a plane,
I'll lose it.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.417
- Oh, [bleep].

08:39.486 --> 08:40.919
- They're in the air!
- No.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.855
I can't get my right leg out.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.507
- Doesn't this remind you
of "The Shining"?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.575

So proud of you.

- Thanks.
You're my number one fan.

- Hi.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.688
I'm good. How are you?

09:16.757 --> 09:17.689
- Muah.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.823
What did I miss?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.058
- Is Ange OK?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.660
- She was throwing up
all morning,

09:21.728 --> 09:23.094
probably from drinking all day.
- Aw.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.496
- She was barhopping
by herself?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.031
- She was.
- She was, like,

09:26.099 --> 09:27.399
talking to you, but, like--

09:27.501 --> 09:29.267
- She was going--[laughing]

09:29.336 --> 09:30.602
- Something--something
was malfunctioning.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.170
- Yeah.
- She wasn't--in the van.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.772
- I was like,
yo, amazing vibe out here.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.006
She's like,
but I have to talk to you.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.174
- We'll talk.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.010
- Yeah.
No, I know, I know.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.713
- Earlier that night,
she came into my room,

09:41.782 --> 09:44.482
and she did have a discussion
with me and Chris about it.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.684
- Calm or not calm?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.485
- I thought
I was gonna go [bleep]

09:47.554 --> 09:49.521
Karate Kid
on some mother[bleep].

09:50.924 --> 09:52.190
- She wasn't calm.
[laughter]

09:52.259 --> 09:53.658

09:53.727 --> 09:55.293
<i> "If there's</i>
<i> anything disrespectful,</i>

<i> "The girls can't take it,</i>
<i> I can."</i>

10:01.335 --> 10:02.434

10:02.536 --> 10:03.969
- These girls can take a lot--

10:04.037 --> 10:05.837
a lot of [bleep].

10:05.906 --> 10:06.871
- Disgusting.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.840
- No. No-Nut November.
- No-Nut.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.277
- I am on day eight
of No-Nut November.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.112
[laughter]

10:14.181 --> 10:15.380

then, like,

10:15.449 --> 10:17.048
why did I come?
- Yeah.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.618
- Last night I came close,
no pun intended.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.019
- Where?
- When?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.420
- With myself.
- With himself, with himself.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.155
- Oh, OK.
- You're teasing yourself?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.457
- Yeah, I'm like, ooh.
- You know what?

10:25.559 --> 10:26.992
both: Ew!

10:27.060 --> 10:29.194
- It's funny you say that.
A lot of the times on vacation,

10:29.262 --> 10:31.229
I get a little, like, horny.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.330
- OK.
- I do.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.431
- All right.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.868
Ew.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.069
- You guys liked

10:38.138 --> 10:39.337
the reservations I did
last night, right?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.972
- Yeah, can we go back?
- We should go back.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.574
- Girls, I have something set
up for you you're gonna love--

10:42.643 --> 10:43.842
brunch and mimosas.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.977
both: Ooh!
- [laughing]

10:46.046 --> 10:46.945
It's working.

10:47.014 --> 10:47.979
And for us,

10:48.048 --> 10:49.280
you ever heard
of a muffaletta?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.715
- No.
- What's that?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.883
- It looks like
an Italian sandwich--

10:51.952 --> 10:53.218
Italian meat.
- Oh, [bleep].

10:53.286 --> 10:54.252
- Ooh!

10:54.321 --> 10:55.253
- We're gonna go
try all that out.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.589
- Muffins?
Muffaletta?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.324
Murf?

10:59.393 --> 11:00.692
Murffles?

11:00.761 --> 11:02.427
Never heard that word before.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.695
Muffs.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.131
- Can you bring us home
a sandwich to try?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.565
- When you guys are
going to brunch?

11:07.634 --> 11:09.701
- When Angelina rises
from the dead.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.902
- Yeah, right.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.303
- Yeah, we're gonna
be here all day.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.973
- [gagging]

11:15.042 --> 11:16.474
[sighs]

11:16.543 --> 11:19.244
I need help this morning
so bad, so [bleep] bad.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.512
Hi, guys.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.547
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nice to meet you.

11:22.616 --> 11:25.984
So I called this company
that does emergency IVs.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.252
All righty.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.454
I need the biggest
hangover bag they have.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.790
I've been hugging
a [bleep] toilet bowl all day.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.159
How much [bleep] food is in me
that I keep throwing up,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.493
like, chunks of [bleep]?

11:35.562 --> 11:36.828
Not [bleep].
You know what I'm saying.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.630
Imagine people actually
throw up [bleep].

11:38.699 --> 11:40.465
What would you do?

11:40.534 --> 11:41.633
- All right,
you girls have fun.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.134
- Bye.
Thank you for setting this up.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.169
- You're welcome.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.504
MVPK for muffalettas!

11:46.606 --> 11:47.906
Do you know where
the muffaletta is?

11:47.974 --> 11:48.907
I'll check it out.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.041
all: Muffaletta!

11:50.110 --> 11:51.042
- King didn't do it.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.777
Which way is the muffaletta?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.012
[person squeals]

11:54.081 --> 11:56.081
They act like they ain't
never seen guidos before.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.215
What's up? What's up?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.684
- It's a vibe,
MVP on Bourbon Street.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.519
- You guys know
where the muffalettas are?

12:01.588 --> 12:03.354
- I can smell the mortadella
from here, man.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.689
- Oh, word?
- I can smell the muff.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.057
- Where's the moofalinis?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.358
<i> - They're known</i>
<i> for sandwiches here,</i>

12:07.427 --> 12:09.260
<i> like, good muffalettas.</i>

12:09.329 --> 12:11.930
- Yeah, give me
that muffaletta.

12:11.998 --> 12:12.931
You're Italian.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.165
- Yep.
- I could tell.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.767
- So y'all have to do
the muffaletta.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.569
- Yeah, that's what I was told.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.104
So all right,
we're gonna try this thing.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.505
I told you.
- All right, cool.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.875
Are you having a little
"DWTS" withdrawal right now?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.043
- I don't know what I'm having.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.578
- Listen, you might have
side effects

12:26.680 --> 12:28.046
from No-Nut November.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.547
- Because your pee-pee shrinks
if you don't use it.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.749
- One full month, 30 days.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.083
Your pee-pee--
- Your pee-pee shrinks.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.318
- Your pee-pee shrinks.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.319
- I need that.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.520
My [bleep] is [bleep] huge.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.888
- If you don't use it...

12:36.957 --> 12:38.456
- You lose it.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.824
- That's it.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.359
- Ange, are you alive?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.128
- Angeliners?
- No, I'm not alive.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.362
I'm gonna die.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.098
- You are the most
dramatic of dramatics.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.266
- It's--girl.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.468
- Pauly set up a mimosa day.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.003
- A mimosa honestly
might help you.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.371
<i> You need a mimosa.</i>

12:53.440 --> 12:54.706
You need a Bloody Mary.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.774
<i> We're on vacation.</i>

12:55.842 --> 12:56.941
Get your [bleep] together.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.376

28:01.380 --> 28:04.448
both: Oh!

28:04.517 --> 28:06.116
- All right,
I guess we doing it.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.851
- He's signing it.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.987
Let's get that will out
so he can sign that too.

28:10.089 --> 28:10.988
- I want the house.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.389
- Oh, my God, is he Bill Gates?

28:12.458 --> 28:14.358
- I want that new pool.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.659
- I want that Versace shirt.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.262
- [mumbling indistinctly]

28:18.330 --> 28:19.263
- Vinny's gonna have to inherit

28:19.331 --> 28:20.297
the beef with Angeliner.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.032
- She had texted me

28:22.134 --> 28:24.234
a couple weeks prior.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.936
- Kitchen to Pauly D.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.443
- Is this, like,
an alligator place?

28:35.748 --> 28:37.614
- What is happening?
I don't trust it.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.119
- Yo, my wife's gonna
go crazy, man.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.887
- I had nothing
to do with this, Laurens.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.389
- Y'all think
this was a good idea?

28:45.458 --> 28:46.457
- This was your idea.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.471
- This is lit.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.705
- I don't know how
I'm gonna get this done,

29:01.774 --> 29:02.906
but I'm gonna get it done

29:02.975 --> 29:05.642
because I have that faith
in myself.

29:05.711 --> 29:06.643
- The smoke should be here
any minute.

29:06.712 --> 29:07.745
- OK.
- I got, uh--

29:07.813 --> 29:09.012
I got it being delivered.
I got a guy.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.514
- Oh, damn.
- We got a guy.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.683
- It says "regional airport."

29:14.286 --> 29:17.020
- This is definitely cr--
this is definitely crazy.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.689
- We gotta get you a harness,
get you strapped up.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.823
I'm gonna give you
some brief instructions.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.525
- I'm not getting on a plane.

29:21.594 --> 29:22.860
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Proud of you, brother.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.094
He doesn't think about things.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.496
He's so stupid,
it works for him.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.297
He's like, yeah, whatever,
we're going on a plane.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.398
- What?

29:28.467 --> 29:29.867
- Oh--
- Nothing.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.635
- I will let
the circle of trust go,

29:31.704 --> 29:33.270
along with the box.
- Yep.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.343
- What's this guy doing?
This guy's parachuting?

29:41.781 --> 29:43.180
- Fellas.
- Oh, they got the box.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.348
- What is going on here?

29:44.416 --> 29:45.682
- Fellas.
- Yo, you got the goods?

29:45.751 --> 29:46.750
- We got the box.
- How you making out?

29:46.819 --> 29:47.918
- Yo, you didn't
open the box, right?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.186
- Did you open that?
- No.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.654
- What is going on?
- Yes, my man.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.055
Appreciate you.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.657
All right,
circle of trust, right?

29:53.726 --> 29:55.826
- The box doesn't look
tampered with.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.361
They are now
in the circle of trust.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.463
You guys are now
in the circle of trust.

29:59.532 --> 30:00.898
- This is a gender reveal.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.499
This guy's jumping
out of a plane,

30:02.568 --> 30:04.601
and what's in here
is the reveal.

30:04.670 --> 30:05.602
- What?
- Yeah.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.371
Yup.
- This is insanity.

30:07.439 --> 30:09.339
- Yo, my wife's gonna
kill me, man.

30:09.408 --> 30:12.109
I'm more scared of what
the wifey's gonna do right now

30:12.211 --> 30:13.343
than jumping out of this plane.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.344
She's gonna start crying.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.946
I guarantee you, flipping out.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.348
- Bro, you better be in the sky
already when she gets here.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.450
- The chute better
be [bleep] deployed...

30:20.519 --> 30:22.085
- Red or blue smoke.
- When she gets here.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.121
- And not for nothing, he
didn't know he was coming here,

30:24.223 --> 30:26.456
and we passed, like,
14, like...

30:26.525 --> 30:27.591
- Airports.
- Airport signs.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.992
He didn't realize
what was going on.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.427
- All he was talking about was
Angelina's text messages.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.929
He's gonna be up in the air,
talking to the guy.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.998
He'll be like, you know,
"I don't what got into her!

30:35.067 --> 30:36.433
She said I could do it!"

30:36.502 --> 30:38.535
- "She told me to go hard
on Twitter."

30:38.604 --> 30:40.737
- "She told me to tweet."

30:40.806 --> 30:41.939
- Let's get it.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.273
- Bye, Mike!

30:43.342 --> 30:44.875
Saying goodbye feels
kind of sketchy.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.076
- Yo, this is crazy.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.044
- I don't want it to be the
last time

30:47.112 --> 30:48.278
I say bye to Mike.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.913
- Let's get it in.
- Yo, let's get it in!

30:49.982 --> 30:51.582
Let's get it!
- Let's get it, boys!

30:51.650 --> 30:53.317
- Let's [bleep] go!
- "Gender reveal" on three.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.319
- "Gender reveal" on three.
- Wait, "It's a girl."

30:55.387 --> 30:57.521
- Oh. "It's a girl" on three.
- Oh, [bleep], now he knows.

30:57.590 --> 31:00.023
- You just revealed it again
before the reveal.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.359
[overlapping chatter]

31:02.428 --> 31:03.460
- Oops.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.995
"Gender reveal."
- "Gender reveal."

31:05.064 --> 31:06.063
- Yo, we're turning,
we're turning.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.431
What is that?
Read the sign.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.899
- Airport?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.067
- What?
- We're leaving?

31:10.135 --> 31:11.969
[overlapping chatter]

31:12.037 --> 31:13.937
- We're at an airport.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.305
- Are we going
in a [bleep] plane?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.473
- Are you [bleep] me?

31:16.542 --> 31:17.908
- I'm not going
in a little plane.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.376
Like, what is happening?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.911
- Is Pauly flying?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.880
- Oh, I won't do that. No.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.648
- What is happening?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.183
- One, two, three.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.218
all: Gender reveal!

31:28.320 --> 31:30.087
- This right here is XXL.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.455
<i> This is magnum.</i>

31:31.523 --> 31:33.357
This is go big or go home.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.392
- Yo, this is crazy!

31:35.461 --> 31:36.827
He's in the plane.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.562
- Are we getting pranked?
- What is going on?

31:38.631 --> 31:39.563
- What is that?

31:39.632 --> 31:41.031
- Yo, those tires need air.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.633
- Damn, that's a G right there.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.334
- What's happening?
- I don't [bleep] know.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.502
- What the [bleep]
are they doing?

31:45.571 --> 31:46.737
- Oh, now it's getting real.
- Oh, wow.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.171
- Now it's getting real.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.840
- Our top speed is
120 miles an hour.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.075
[indistinct]
- [indistinct]

31:52.144 --> 31:54.111
- What is this?
- Can we go skydiving?

31:54.179 --> 31:55.312
- Oh, this is wild.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.847
- I still can't believe
he's up there.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.148
- Who's doing this?

31:58.217 --> 32:00.050
If my husband's in a plane,
I'll lose it.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.018
- What the [bleep]
is happening?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.052
- Chris and Zack are here.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.353
- Oh, [bleep].
- Oh, [bleep].

32:03.422 --> 32:04.788
This is not gonna be good.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.423
- I think the boys went
skydiving.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.991
- No.
- They have to.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.593
They're in the air.
- No.

32:09.662 --> 32:10.794
- What?
- You're lying.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.764
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

32:13.832 --> 32:15.766
<i> Where's Mike?</i>
<i> Where is he?</i>

32:15.834 --> 32:17.267
I will kill Mike.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.069
<i> No. No.</i>

32:23.108 --> 32:24.074
<i> - ♪ I'm like a bird ♪</i>

<i> ♪ But, baby,</i>
<i> all I need for you to know ♪</i>

32:33.018 --> 32:35.452
- I'm really at peace
for this gender reveal.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.487
<i> I'm cruising at 10,000 feet,</i>

32:37.556 --> 32:40.324
but I'm looking out the window
like a little kid, like--

32:40.392 --> 32:41.825
<i> the adrenaline's pumping,</i>

32:41.894 --> 32:43.694
but there's nothing
but positive vibes.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.232
<i> [music distorts and stops]</i>

32:49.301 --> 32:50.767
- I think the boys went
skydiving.

32:50.836 --> 32:51.735
- I will kill Mike.

32:51.804 --> 32:52.970
- Oh, [bleep].

32:53.038 --> 32:54.571
- Oh, [bleep].
- I gotta go do something.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.707
- The girls pull up, and they
have no idea what's going on.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.141
I'm just focused on Laurens.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.510
- This is a skydiving place.
- No.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.511
- This is not gonna be good.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.646
<i> I don't wanna be the one</i>

33:02.715 --> 33:03.647
that tells Laurens
what's going down.

33:03.716 --> 33:04.681
You guys got this, right?

33:04.750 --> 33:05.649
- Yeah--yo, oh.

33:05.718 --> 33:06.917
[laughter]

33:06.986 --> 33:08.719
<i> - I'd 100% rather be</i>
<i> up in the sky</i>

33:08.787 --> 33:09.786
about to jump out of a plane.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.154
- I didn't think
this far ahead.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.723
- My nipples are cold.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.291
- Should we tell her
Mike's in the bathroom?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.826
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What is happening?

33:15.894 --> 33:16.893
- This is weird.
- Where's Mike?

33:16.962 --> 33:18.195
- I'm not doing this.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.262
<i> My husband's there.</i>

33:19.331 --> 33:20.397
- Hi, babe.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.099
- My husband said
that he was at the hotel.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.467
<i> So why are you lying?</i>

33:23.535 --> 33:25.502
I don't like this [bleep],
Christopher.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.037
- Where's Mike?

33:27.106 --> 33:28.772
- I'm not doing this.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.341
- If he's in a plane,
I'm gonna murder all of you

33:31.410 --> 33:32.843
one at a time.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.277
- I didn't do anything.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.912
- I know what this is.

33:35.981 --> 33:37.481
- [distorted]
Can I jump out of a plane?

33:37.549 --> 33:38.648
- [distorted] No!

33:38.717 --> 33:40.484
[normal]
And I did not approve it.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.585
You're dead.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.487
- Me? I didn't do anything.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.988
- Is this the baby reveal?

33:45.057 --> 33:47.557
- Laurens, I just wanted
to say, we love you so much.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.159
<i> - I hope I'm wrong.</i>

33:49.228 --> 33:50.160
I don't know.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.528
I'm gonna kill both of you.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.063
- I didn't do anything.
- Vinny!

33:53.132 --> 33:54.398
- What is really happening?

33:54.466 --> 33:55.632
- Where is he?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.202
Pauly's going like this,

33:59.304 --> 34:00.303
and, I'm like--[gasps]

34:00.372 --> 34:01.471
- Yeah.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.572
- Yo.
- Oh, my...

34:02.641 --> 34:06.410
- You have to be [bleep]
kidding me.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.311
- She's calling him.
- [imitating Mike] Hi, honeys.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.312
- Hi, where are you?

34:09.381 --> 34:11.148
- I love you so much.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.150
[laughter]

34:13.218 --> 34:15.685
- No!
- Oh, my God.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.987
- Yo, take my phone.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.023
- I thought he'd answer!

34:20.092 --> 34:23.360
- If Mike doesn't die
from jumping out of a plane,

34:23.429 --> 34:26.396
he's gonna die when Lauren
beats his ass when he lands.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.431
- Are you OK?

34:27.499 --> 34:28.665
- Yeah, I have to pee so bad.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.133
- I don't know if you want
to go right now.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.501
- Where is he?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.005
- OK, yeah, yeah.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.409
- OK.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.646
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.116
- Are we--are we--

34:46.185 --> 34:47.951
are we tightened in now?
- Yeah.

34:48.020 --> 34:51.154
- At 10,000 feet
looking down at the runway...

34:51.223 --> 34:52.456
Oh, [bleep].

34:52.524 --> 34:54.191
There's not any looking back.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.095
- Who came up with this?

35:00.499 --> 35:02.065
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.301
- Is he really doing it,
or is someone else doing it?

35:04.369 --> 35:05.469
Because we talked about
someone else doing it.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.736
- In the middle of nowhere.
- Yeah.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.073
- Oh, [bleep], let's get it.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.209
- Yeah, [indistinct].

that means do tricks.

And if he goes like this,
it means no tricks.
