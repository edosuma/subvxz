01:27.060 --> 01:29.980
He had no idea how to take care of himself.

01:30.063 --> 01:31.899
He used to condition, then shampoo.

01:31.982 --> 01:33.733
He didn't even know how to change a diaper.

01:33.817 --> 01:35.068
How could I leave my baby with that?

01:35.152 --> 01:36.486
Hey, maybe nobody taught him.

01:36.569 --> 01:37.821
And maybe he's a dumbass.

01:39.239 --> 01:43.869
But still, I feel really bad
for missing her first birthday.

01:43.952 --> 01:45.913
It's a big one, you know?

01:47.414 --> 01:49.624
- Hurry up.
- Can I rinse off?

01:49.707 --> 01:52.002
They used to hold an empty one for Red.

01:53.211 --> 01:56.214
- Move it! Do it in the fucking sink.
- Ow! That hurts!

01:56.298 --> 01:57.590
Gracias.

02:00.177 --> 02:01.178
What the f...

02:03.471 --> 02:04.848
Aw, man!

02:06.349 --> 02:07.475
Ew...

02:07.559 --> 02:10.270
All right, everybody out now! Let's go!

02:14.649 --> 02:19.571
All right, listen up! We got
plumbing issues in Spanish Harlem.

02:19.654 --> 02:22.074
Shit's flooded and we gotta get to work.

02:22.157 --> 02:24.159
- So?
- So they wanna cut.

02:24.242 --> 02:25.786
Aw, man! No, fuck that.

02:25.869 --> 02:28.121
You want breakfast? That's how it is.

02:28.205 --> 02:29.206
The fuck?

02:29.289 --> 02:34.044
Excuse me! But my girls are not
inclined to offer special privileges.

02:34.127 --> 02:35.628
Not in our bathroom.

02:35.712 --> 02:39.216
Your girls? When did that happen?

02:39.299 --> 02:41.844
Ladies? Get on line.

02:41.927 --> 02:42.928
Yeah.

02:43.011 --> 02:46.264
You violatin' an unspoken
social contract, bitch.

02:46.348 --> 02:48.391
_

02:48.475 --> 02:50.518
- What the fuck you call me?
- Stop it!

02:50.602 --> 02:54.982
Hey! Cut it out! Cut it out! Settle down!

02:56.066 --> 02:58.526
- What is going on here?
- She fucking punched me.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.779
I didn't punch. Man, I
pushed her, like this.

03:01.864 --> 03:02.906
Oh!

03:04.407 --> 03:05.825
- Did you see that?
- Dramatic.

03:05.909 --> 03:08.661
- Oh, come on, sister!
- Don't "sister" me.

03:10.705 --> 03:12.082
- I'm writing you a shot.
- What?

03:12.165 --> 03:13.166
- Officer, please. This...
- Come on!

03:13.250 --> 03:16.503
- No! This ain't even their bathroom!
- What? You want a shot, too?

03:20.173 --> 03:22.842
Don't ever call a black guard "sister."

03:22.926 --> 03:24.552
You know that.

03:25.345 --> 03:26.429
Go.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.604
Get out.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.258
_

05:31.972 --> 05:34.891
Sorry. You can't buy beer with food stamps.

05:34.975 --> 05:36.101
Just take it.

05:37.477 --> 05:38.478
Excuse me?

05:38.561 --> 05:41.023
It's a $100 EBT card. Just give me $50.

05:41.106 --> 05:42.315
Come on, everybody knows you do this shit.

05:46.569 --> 05:48.946
- Forget it.
- Yeah.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.201
Take a hike!

05:53.285 --> 05:56.871
We don't do that shit here.
You got the wrong store.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.292
Fifty.

06:02.169 --> 06:04.003
Minus the cost of the beer.

06:37.537 --> 06:39.331
_

06:43.835 --> 06:44.836
_

06:45.378 --> 06:47.797
All of the girls must want to have sex.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.966
Yes, Chang, we know.
It's not a rape contest.

06:50.049 --> 06:52.635
- What contest?
- We're having a Bang-Off.

06:52.719 --> 06:56.514
All the girls must be here on camp.

06:56.598 --> 06:59.309
Really? You mean we can't
pull from the local bars?

06:59.392 --> 07:01.853
Yeah, how about, "All girls must be human"?

07:01.936 --> 07:03.813
Or would that be a problem for you, Boo?

07:03.896 --> 07:05.898
That happened one time.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.443
We were drunk.

07:08.526 --> 07:10.570
So, do they have to come for it to count?

07:10.653 --> 07:11.988
Excellent question.

07:12.072 --> 07:16.409
Have to? Son, with me, they always come.

07:16.493 --> 07:19.036
Oh, only once? That's so sad.

07:19.121 --> 07:20.913
Hey, Chang, can we get
extra points for multiples?

07:20.997 --> 07:22.039
I'm the queen of excess.

07:22.124 --> 07:26.919
No. No double points but different
girls worth different points.

07:28.838 --> 07:30.590
- What is that?
- Score sheet.

07:31.883 --> 07:35.512
Trim, six. Chapman, three.

07:35.595 --> 07:38.348
I don't wanna play the
game. Don't put me in that.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.227
- Three out of what?
- Ten.

07:42.310 --> 07:47.315
Ten's like a guard, right?
And one's like that girl.

07:47.399 --> 07:50.735
I am so more than a three. I am not easy.

07:50.818 --> 07:54.197
You're slutty, not easy. There's
a difference, semantically.

07:54.281 --> 07:56.032
Yeah, you're not easy.

07:56.116 --> 07:57.950
You only fucked your worst enemy.

07:58.034 --> 08:02.455
Alex was not my enemy
at the time. That I knew.

08:04.374 --> 08:05.625
It was complicated.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.045
She has that effect on me.

08:09.129 --> 08:11.673
Me, too. Love to get my dick in her mouth.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.218
Maybe she'll come back
in time for the game.

08:17.011 --> 08:18.221
Don't count on it.

08:19.889 --> 08:20.973
Hey.

08:22.934 --> 08:25.478
- What y'all playing?
- Nothing.

08:25.562 --> 08:27.605
A game as old as time.

08:27.689 --> 08:30.024
Oh, yeah? What's it called?

08:30.483 --> 08:31.568
Exclusion.

08:32.777 --> 08:34.736
Cool. How do you play it?

08:40.284 --> 08:42.578
Man, it's bullshit, man.

08:42.662 --> 08:45.332
I already got two shots for
being late to the warehouse.

08:45.415 --> 08:47.875
And now I got another for
trying to keep from being late?

08:47.959 --> 08:49.252
This is our bathroom.

08:50.503 --> 08:53.047
- When I was here last time...
- Oh, God!

08:53.130 --> 08:54.131
We've heard.

08:54.216 --> 08:55.925
That was back in the good ol' days,

08:56.008 --> 08:58.470
when you could stab a bitch in
her sleep and nobody said nothin'.

08:58.553 --> 09:01.389
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you like
being another woman's doormat?

09:02.599 --> 09:04.684
Look, who said anything
about being a doormat, man?

09:04.767 --> 09:06.478
Shit. I'm my own doormat.

09:06.561 --> 09:09.439
Yes, but a doormat to where?

09:09.522 --> 09:10.857
I am telling you,

09:10.940 --> 09:14.026
unless we do something now, this
is gonna become the way it is.

09:15.445 --> 09:17.364
Spanish running things.

09:17.447 --> 09:19.282
And we can't look to the screws for help.

09:19.366 --> 09:22.076
"Screws"? Man, you are old.

09:23.536 --> 09:25.913
I'm just saying those girls
need to learn some manners.

09:27.207 --> 09:28.458
I know what you sayin'.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.542
Do you, baby?

09:30.877 --> 09:37.008
Fork on the left. Knife on the
right. Little fork on the outer left.

09:37.091 --> 09:38.218
It's cold out here.

09:38.718 --> 09:40.387
You'll warm up once we get working.

09:40.470 --> 09:43.931
Irma, you and Frieda start
pulling weeds out of the floor.

09:44.015 --> 09:46.976
Taslitz and Jimmy and I will
start clearing out this junk.

09:47.059 --> 09:48.853
Oh, I can't stay long.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.898
- Jack is taking me to the movies tonight.
- Okay.

09:51.981 --> 09:55.735
We need to get there early. There'll
be a huge line for Easter Parade.

09:55.818 --> 09:58.238
Jimmy, maybe you help pull weeds?

09:58.321 --> 10:00.031
All right. But I have to go soon.

10:00.114 --> 10:02.033
Girls, give me a hand with this, huh?

10:03.410 --> 10:04.577
What?

10:04.661 --> 10:06.996
You said this greenhouse
club would be relaxing.

10:07.079 --> 10:08.581
Give us time away from the noise.

10:08.665 --> 10:10.500
You didn't say nothing about hauling wood.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.669
You wanna get warm or not?

10:14.921 --> 10:17.048
- Morning, ladies.
- Morning, Mr. Healy.

10:17.131 --> 10:18.132
Is that Jack?

10:19.259 --> 10:20.427
Oh.

10:21.928 --> 10:24.013
Quite a little challenge
you've set for yourself, Red.

10:24.096 --> 10:26.641
Yes, I'm getting that feeling.

10:26.724 --> 10:29.519
Ladies, would you mind if
I spoke to Red for a minute?

10:29.602 --> 10:32.605
Uh, not at all. We'll
go help pulling weeds.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.699
So, they're putting up a production
of Our Town at Litchfield High tonight.

10:42.782 --> 10:45.868
Do you think maybe that'd be a
good thing to take Katya to see?

10:45.952 --> 10:50.290
I don't know. I'm not familiar with the
actors at that particular high school.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.711
I thought maybe a little
culture would be nice.

10:54.794 --> 10:58.298
Mostly, I just wanna get away
from her mother for the evening.

10:59.799 --> 11:01.718
Or we could just go to dinner.

11:01.801 --> 11:03.553
They just opened an Italian
place. What do you think?

11:03.636 --> 11:05.305
Healy,

11:07.307 --> 11:10.560
we had an agreement back
when I ran the kitchen.

11:10.643 --> 11:14.481
You scratched my back, and I told you
when it was time to trim your ear hairs.

11:15.732 --> 11:18.192
But I don't need my back scratched anymore

11:18.275 --> 11:19.944
and I'd rather be left alone.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.489
I'm just asking your opinion.

11:25.116 --> 11:27.494
Skip the play. Take her to dinner.

11:27.577 --> 11:31.623
- Italian?
- What, romantic Indian? Come on.

11:31.706 --> 11:33.500
All right. Thank you.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.503
Hey, Healy, can we get
a space heater in here?

11:36.586 --> 11:38.170
I'll look into it.

11:38.254 --> 11:39.381
Probably not.

11:40.673 --> 11:42.174
Shit licker.

11:43.092 --> 11:44.260
Can we grow pot?

11:45.803 --> 11:49.140
So I heard from my cousin that the
whole front of the building on the corner

11:49.223 --> 11:51.768
fell off and crashed onto the sidewalk?

11:51.851 --> 11:54.020
Yeah. Boom.

11:55.522 --> 11:57.314
Hey.

11:57.399 --> 12:00.151
Check out the anti-suicide poster.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.614
You think someone tried to
do it in, like, right in here?

12:05.698 --> 12:07.825
- Maybe right where you're sitting?
- Oh, Cal!

12:07.909 --> 12:09.536
What? It's just a question.

12:10.995 --> 12:13.665
Oh, Piper! Oh, what a relief.

12:15.750 --> 12:16.751
What?

12:16.834 --> 12:20.046
Oh. She was worried that you
wouldn't be pretty anymore.

12:20.129 --> 12:22.006
- Hey! Mmm.
- Hey.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.175
I told you. She won the fight.

12:24.258 --> 12:27.219
That's right. I kicked ass.

12:27.303 --> 12:29.556
I spent three weeks in solitary confinement

12:29.639 --> 12:31.474
just thinking, "Winner!"

12:31.558 --> 12:35.895
- Yeah!
- Oh, Piper. Did Larry come to visit you?

12:37.229 --> 12:40.692
No. And he won't be coming to visit me.

12:40.775 --> 12:43.861
I told you. We broke up.

12:43.945 --> 12:46.489
Well, his earning
potential was questionable.

12:46.573 --> 12:49.325
I was hoping that you would
have, like, a gnarly scar.

12:49.408 --> 12:51.786
Add character and mystery.

12:51.869 --> 12:53.538
There's still time.

12:53.621 --> 12:56.583
You'll find another man. I can help you.

12:56.666 --> 12:59.210
- There's no need for that.
- No, I want to.

12:59.293 --> 13:01.463
Wasn't Neri supposed to come?

13:01.546 --> 13:02.839
Yes. They wouldn't let her in.

13:02.922 --> 13:05.382
There was some issue with her
background check. She's in the lobby.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.926
I tell you what I find most disturbing

13:07.009 --> 13:09.929
is that it looks almost exactly
like my old high school in here.

13:11.097 --> 13:12.724
Same cinder block construction,

13:12.807 --> 13:16.435
low ceilings, oppressive
fluorescent lighting.

13:16.519 --> 13:21.190
I wonder if that's intentional.
Like part of the punishment?

13:21.273 --> 13:25.945
If so, kudos to the
government, because it's genius.

13:28.615 --> 13:30.617
And where's Daddy?

13:32.159 --> 13:33.244
He didn't wanna see me?

13:33.327 --> 13:37.081
Of course he did,
darling. Something came up.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.166
Nothing came up. You
don't have to lie to me.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.543
He doesn't wanna see me in here.

13:40.627 --> 13:44.213
- That's right.
- No, Cal. That is not right.

13:44.296 --> 13:45.757
You can't let her think that.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.842
- Well, it's better than the other thing.
- No.

13:47.925 --> 13:50.386
- What other thing?
- It's nothing.

13:50.469 --> 13:54.223
Well, then if it's nothing, can you
at least tell me what it is? Cal?

13:54.306 --> 13:55.642
We agreed that we shouldn't tell you.

13:57.143 --> 13:58.645
But you can guess.

13:58.728 --> 14:01.731
Oh, no. Is it bad?

14:01.814 --> 14:04.025
Oh, stop it, Cal. This is not appropriate.

14:04.108 --> 14:05.401
What is not appropriate?

14:05.484 --> 14:08.571
I am an adult who is in
prison! I can handle things.

14:09.781 --> 14:12.992
You have to tell me
what it is. God damn it!

14:13.075 --> 14:15.077
Did Daddy lose his job?

14:15.161 --> 14:17.163
- Did your house burn down?
- No.

14:17.246 --> 14:18.831
Did my house burn down?

14:18.915 --> 14:22.251
- No, darling, it isn't property.
- No hints, please.

14:22.334 --> 14:24.211
- So it's a person?
- Yeah.

14:24.295 --> 14:27.256
Is Daddy sick? Dead? Is Daddy dead?

14:27.339 --> 14:29.551
Darling, Daddy is fine.

14:29.634 --> 14:32.970
Aside from his cholesterol, but
he's taking fish oil for that.

14:33.054 --> 14:35.389
Keep going. You're getting
warmer. Daddy's fine, but...

14:35.472 --> 14:39.310
Danny? Polly? Larry? Grandmother!

14:39.393 --> 14:41.688
Grandmother's dead! Grand...
Dying! Grandmother's dying!

14:41.771 --> 14:43.773
Yes! Grandmother's dying!

14:43.856 --> 14:46.150
Grandmother's dying!

14:51.823 --> 14:53.199
Oh, no.

14:56.703 --> 14:58.037
Oh, my God.

15:01.708 --> 15:06.546
Mendoza, your people are not
authorized to use the B-Dorm bathroom.

15:06.629 --> 15:07.922
You have your own bathroom.

15:08.005 --> 15:11.092
Is that what you call that
place with the fountains of caca?

15:11.175 --> 15:13.928
- I'm getting a plumber.
- When?

15:14.011 --> 15:17.139
When I get authorization from Fig
when she gets back from Albany.

15:17.223 --> 15:18.432
Well, in the meantime,

15:18.515 --> 15:21.102
don't you think your kitchen workers
should have a sanitary place to go?

15:21.185 --> 15:24.772
Especially since they're the ones
taking the crust off your sandwiches?

15:26.899 --> 15:29.276
You didn't even ask. You just stormed in.

15:31.362 --> 15:36.075
Mr. Caputo, can my people use
the B-Dorm bathroom? Please?

15:37.368 --> 15:40.412
Fine. You can share it. For now.

15:41.455 --> 15:45.167
Thank you. By the way, can I
have a candle for my office?

15:45.251 --> 15:46.961
You wanna light a candle,

15:47.044 --> 15:50.923
go to church on Sunday, use
one of the electric ones.

15:51.007 --> 15:53.425
Don't get cocky with me, Mendoza.

15:53.509 --> 15:57.429
You're important, but you're
replaceable. Don't forget that.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.060
_

16:03.144 --> 16:05.229
_

16:05.312 --> 16:06.939

16:07.023 --> 16:10.026

16:10.109 --> 16:12.028

16:12.111 --> 16:13.529

16:19.076 --> 16:20.077

16:20.161 --> 16:22.664
_

16:22.789 --> 16:24.165
Gloria.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.127
_

16:29.003 --> 16:30.630
_

16:31.588 --> 16:32.589
_

16:33.590 --> 16:34.591
_

16:35.176 --> 16:37.469
_

16:38.512 --> 16:40.807
_

16:40.890 --> 16:42.266

16:43.184 --> 16:46.395
_

16:46.478 --> 16:48.815
_

16:49.523 --> 16:50.858
Arturo!

16:53.527 --> 16:54.821
Benito! Julio!

16:54.904 --> 16:55.905
_

17:02.995 --> 17:04.163
Florecita!

17:08.084 --> 17:09.085
_

17:09.167 --> 17:12.003
_

17:12.714 --> 17:14.506
_

17:14.674 --> 17:15.717
_

17:18.344 --> 17:19.846
_

17:26.935 --> 17:28.730
_

17:28.813 --> 17:33.025
_

17:33.109 --> 17:34.711
_

17:34.712 --> 17:36.859
_

17:38.823 --> 17:41.868
_

17:42.201 --> 17:44.078
Who are you praying for, tía?

17:45.621 --> 17:47.039
Tu mamá.

17:48.332 --> 17:49.917
Excellent. Now, you're gonna cook this

17:50.001 --> 17:54.964
very slowly for a couple hours, make
sure the meat is very tender. So...

17:55.047 --> 17:56.632
Gruber's out of play.

17:56.716 --> 17:58.968
Who's Gruber? Oh!

17:59.051 --> 18:01.262
Like the freckly girl
with the giant forehead?

18:01.345 --> 18:04.015
In the woodshed. Behind the band saw.

18:04.098 --> 18:08.770
Everybody else was making a
shelf, and we were making L-O-V-E.

18:08.853 --> 18:10.938
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm not sure
that's how you spell "gross."

18:11.022 --> 18:14.901
But congratulations, Boo. You
got yourself a one-pointer.

18:14.984 --> 18:17.111
Boob in the hand is worth two in the bush.

18:17.194 --> 18:19.238
Yeah, well, it's only the bush that counts.

18:20.656 --> 18:21.991
But, hey! Keep it up.

18:22.074 --> 18:25.870
There's plenty of other nickel
slots in Low Self Esteem City.

18:25.953 --> 18:29.874
You want me, I'll be playing
for big money at a private table.

18:29.957 --> 18:32.168
Well, by that, you must
mean playing with yourself,

18:32.251 --> 18:34.586
'cause I don't see you
playing with anybody else.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.047
Oh, no?

18:37.298 --> 18:39.341
Hey, Officer Fischer?

18:39.425 --> 18:42.219
Hey, would you mind turning the
volume up for me on the television?

18:42.303 --> 18:43.637
It's just that it's kind of low.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.597
Sure, Nichols.

18:46.933 --> 18:47.975
the vegetables, the garlic adds...

18:48.059 --> 18:49.518
Hey, thanks.

18:49.601 --> 18:52.438
Hey, you look lovely today, by the way.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.524
Well, thank you.

18:55.607 --> 18:56.733
Sure.

18:59.403 --> 19:03.991
See, I'm not interested in running
some sweaty fallopian relay race.

19:04.075 --> 19:06.911
I look at this like an art form.

19:06.994 --> 19:08.704
You're out of your depth.

19:10.289 --> 19:12.541
My depth has no depth.

19:13.542 --> 19:17.463
I am a sexual Steve Jobs. And
that bitch is worth 10 points.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.592
But I made reservations
at the Spaghetti Factory.

19:21.675 --> 19:24.971
You should have asked me.
I made plans with Ulya.

19:25.054 --> 19:27.723
Well, I'd really appreciate
it if you could reschedule.

19:27.807 --> 19:28.808
What?

19:29.016 --> 19:30.267
_

19:30.642 --> 19:32.019
_

19:32.186 --> 19:33.270
_

19:33.980 --> 19:35.564
_

19:36.065 --> 19:37.984
_

19:38.067 --> 19:40.486
_

19:40.569 --> 19:43.239
_

19:43.322 --> 19:44.866
_

19:45.324 --> 19:49.495
_

19:50.329 --> 19:54.083
Can you please speak English?

19:54.166 --> 19:57.044
Why we speak English?
Why not you speak Russian?

19:57.128 --> 19:59.046
Why? Because you live in America now!

19:59.130 --> 20:02.549
And I don't think it's so horrible for
me to want to do something nice together!

20:02.633 --> 20:04.218
You can see Ulya any day of the week.

20:04.301 --> 20:07.138
It's not like you have to
go to a job or anything!

20:14.353 --> 20:15.479
I'm sorry.

20:18.983 --> 20:20.860
I didn't mean to lose my temper.

20:29.118 --> 20:33.039
_

20:37.709 --> 20:40.504
Maybe we could all go
out some place together.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.340
Or if you don't feel like
eating, we can go see a play.

20:44.716 --> 20:47.344
I want to spend time with my friend.

20:48.387 --> 20:52.599
Right. Which is why I said
Ulya's welcome to come.

20:59.941 --> 21:03.569
_

21:04.653 --> 21:08.532
_

21:09.408 --> 21:12.078
You don't have any friends, Sam.

21:18.292 --> 21:21.963
Yo, the water pressure is
so much better in the ghetto.

21:22.046 --> 21:23.214
I know, right?

21:23.297 --> 21:24.840
It's fucked up.

21:24.924 --> 21:27.426
It's like they're
getting special privileges

21:27.509 --> 21:29.011
and we're the black people.

21:29.095 --> 21:31.055
Hey, wait. Where the fuck are my shoes?

21:31.138 --> 21:33.265
Where are my fucking shoes?

21:35.267 --> 21:36.810
This was in my bed.

21:36.893 --> 21:39.605
Hey, ladies, you better get to moving.

21:39.688 --> 21:43.192
If you don't hurry, you
gonna be late for work.

21:43.275 --> 21:44.526
Gank!

21:48.114 --> 21:51.658
Oh, fuck. It's on.

21:51.742 --> 21:53.995
Somebody start untangling this shit.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.294
What's the matter with you?

22:04.338 --> 22:05.965
Nothing.

22:09.301 --> 22:10.886
My grandmother is sick.

22:10.970 --> 22:12.554
Oh...

22:12.638 --> 22:14.806
I thought maybe I caught you with a porn.

22:15.724 --> 22:18.727
A sick babushka is
nothing to be ashamed of.

22:18.810 --> 22:21.105
I don't wanna bore anyone with my problems.

22:21.188 --> 22:23.899
All problems are boring
until they're your own.

22:26.610 --> 22:27.611
Count time.

22:27.694 --> 22:28.862
You must stand at count.

22:28.945 --> 22:32.658
Repeat, you must stand
at count under code 320.

22:34.035 --> 22:35.119
What happened?

22:36.495 --> 22:39.498
She scraped her foot
turning laps in the pool.

22:40.832 --> 22:42.834
When it wasn't healing, she
went in to see the doctor

22:42.918 --> 22:46.004
and it turns out her kidney
levels were off the charts.

22:46.088 --> 22:49.258
So they put her on dialysis,
and then she got an infection.

22:49.341 --> 22:50.759
That's how it happens.

22:50.842 --> 22:54.763
It all goes at once. Like
internal organ dominoes.

22:54.846 --> 22:57.641
I'm sorry. That's probably
not what you want to hear.

22:57.724 --> 23:01.103
It's all right. I'm not
looking for sympathy.

23:01.187 --> 23:06.775
I'm trying to follow your lead,
actually. Be strong. Suffer in silence.

23:06.858 --> 23:08.860
I like the silent part.

23:08.944 --> 23:11.405
She might pull through.

23:11.488 --> 23:15.617
Anyhow, what is it that they say?

23:15.701 --> 23:17.744
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.

23:17.828 --> 23:18.870
What?

23:18.954 --> 23:21.582
It's something that Clive Owen
says in the movie Croupier.

23:21.665 --> 23:23.459
Is it supposed to be comforting?

23:23.542 --> 23:26.962
It probably would be comforting
if Clive Owen were here to say it.

23:27.045 --> 23:30.382
Fuck Clive Owen. Don't ever let go.

23:31.883 --> 23:33.969
Not until they make you.

23:38.474 --> 23:42.811
All the water from this bathroom goes
out this pipe under the floor here.

23:42.894 --> 23:46.190
Until it's cleared, you're gonna
have all of the water and effluvia.

23:46.273 --> 23:49.318
It's gonna be comin' out of the pipe
every time you have the showers going.

23:49.401 --> 23:51.778
Well, why? What's the actual problem?

23:51.862 --> 23:53.822
Depends. The snake's not
long enough to reach it, so...

23:53.905 --> 23:54.906
It's probably roots.

23:54.990 --> 23:58.119
Mr. Caputo, may I speak
to you for a moment?

23:59.495 --> 24:00.537
What the hell do you think you're doing?

24:00.621 --> 24:02.123
I didn't sign off on an outside contractor.

24:02.206 --> 24:03.790
I made an executive decision

24:03.874 --> 24:07.669
when you decided not to come to
work yesterday or this morning.

24:07.753 --> 24:10.506
I had a press conference.

24:10.589 --> 24:13.259
My husband is running for state Senate.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.843
Well, this is Jeremy.

24:14.926 --> 24:17.888
He's running for Plumber of
the Prison, where we work.

24:17.971 --> 24:20.056
There's a CO trained in plumbing.

24:20.141 --> 24:21.975
His name is Kanarick.
He's been here already.

24:22.058 --> 24:23.059
And?

24:23.144 --> 24:24.728
To be honest, this isn't
gonna get unclogged.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.355
You're gonna have to
remove the whole exit pipe.

24:26.438 --> 24:28.690
How much is that gonna cost?

24:28.774 --> 24:30.192
Okay, it's embedded in the concrete,

24:30.276 --> 24:34.530
so I gotta get a jackhammer, I gotta
get my pipe fitting crews in here.

24:34.613 --> 24:35.864
How much?

24:35.947 --> 24:37.491
80 grand, minimum.

24:37.574 --> 24:40.536
Jesus Christ on a crutch. And
there's no other alternative?

24:40.619 --> 24:42.913
You can always have the
girls take shorter showers.

24:44.456 --> 24:46.375
Well, that seems like
a reasonable solution.

24:46.458 --> 24:49.586
Solution? That's not a solution.
It's a bullshit stopgap.

24:49.670 --> 24:51.963
- This needs to be addressed.
- And it will be.

24:52.047 --> 24:55.384
But we are dealing with a very
serious deficit at the moment!

24:55.467 --> 24:56.843
As you know.

24:56.927 --> 24:59.971
Besides, there is an approved
list of vendors that we work with.

25:00.055 --> 25:03.267
It's a security issue. You understand.

25:03.350 --> 25:05.561
Shit, why fix the plumbing at all?

25:05.644 --> 25:09.565
Let's just cut their food rations
so they don't shit as much.

25:09.648 --> 25:13.235
I will crunch the numbers
and get back to you on that.

25:13.319 --> 25:15.862
Hey, who's gonna pay
me for coming out here?

25:23.287 --> 25:25.581
- Chapman.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

25:25.664 --> 25:28.209
Sure. Close the door.

25:34.798 --> 25:36.383
Glad to see you're looking well.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.594
Are you?

25:38.677 --> 25:42.138
- Excuse me?
- Nothing. Thank you.

25:44.683 --> 25:45.767
What can I do for you?

25:45.851 --> 25:48.186
My grandmother is very ill.

25:49.688 --> 25:51.022
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:51.106 --> 25:55.361
I know that you probably don't
grant furlough for things like this.

25:55.444 --> 25:59.197
And even if you did, I don't
expect you would ever give it to me.

25:59.281 --> 26:03.869
But I could not live with
myself if I did not at least ask.

26:03.952 --> 26:08.290
Could you please give me
furlough to see my grandmother?

26:08.374 --> 26:09.541
Furlough?

26:10.834 --> 26:13.337
Furlough is like the Loch Ness Monster.

26:14.630 --> 26:17.424
Much discussed and rarely seen.

26:18.675 --> 26:20.511
But don't you have the
power to at least apply?

26:20.594 --> 26:23.639
I'm sorry. There's nothing
I can do to help you.

26:29.353 --> 26:31.104
Is there something else?

26:31.187 --> 26:32.856
No. No. That's it.

26:39.195 --> 26:41.532
- You just stood there.
- What?

26:41.615 --> 26:43.158
You stood there...

26:44.660 --> 26:46.161
while she attacked me!

26:47.579 --> 26:50.248
And then you gave her new teeth.

26:50.332 --> 26:54.670
I was nowhere near the incident, as
Doggett will corroborate, I assure you.

26:54.753 --> 26:58.507
I know that I overstepped my bounds,

27:00.634 --> 27:02.303
but I could've been killed!

27:02.386 --> 27:05.306
Were I there to intervene,
I most certainly would have.

27:05.389 --> 27:09.017
I'm sorry about your grandmother.
Thanks for stopping by.

27:13.689 --> 27:18.360
What do you mean? He's quitting?
Because of the Black Scarecrow?

27:18.444 --> 27:21.863
The Black Scarecrow isn't
even in his weight class,

27:21.947 --> 27:25.241
and even if he was, he has a weakness.

27:25.326 --> 27:27.744
He has a weakness...

27:27.828 --> 27:30.038
What is it this time, you think?

27:30.121 --> 27:32.123
I don't know. I try not to listen.

27:32.207 --> 27:35.293
Ah, come on, there's no
shame in being curious.

27:35.377 --> 27:36.545
I wouldn't want people thinking

27:36.628 --> 27:38.839
I'm sticking my nose
where it doesn't belong.

27:38.922 --> 27:40.341
Yeah, but she could be in trouble.

27:40.424 --> 27:43.719
Hey, the Black Scarecrow could be trying
to extort her for money or something.

27:43.802 --> 27:46.388
No, the Black Scarecrow's a wrestler.

27:46.472 --> 27:48.682
He was supposed to wrestle her
son, but he's chickening out.

27:48.765 --> 27:51.142
I thought you didn't listen.

27:51.226 --> 27:52.853
I couldn't help it.

27:52.936 --> 27:55.939
She was talking about
wrestling while crying!

27:56.022 --> 27:57.232
It doesn't take much.

27:57.315 --> 27:59.901
I once saw her crying
reading a Garfield comic.

27:59.985 --> 28:03.864
I wish I could give her her privacy,
but it's my job to stand here.

28:03.947 --> 28:07.743
It's fine. I mean, not
everybody wants their privacy.

28:07.826 --> 28:09.077
I know I don't.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.579
Yeah?

28:10.662 --> 28:14.875
Yeah, well, you know, I like
privacy, but not alone privacy.

28:16.502 --> 28:18.086
I'm not sure what that means.

28:18.169 --> 28:19.546
It means I work in electrical,

28:19.630 --> 28:21.715
so I know all the spots
where the cameras don't work.

28:21.798 --> 28:25.176
You know, if you're ever feeling
curious about other things.

28:30.098 --> 28:33.894
Do you have a phone call to make?
Because if not, I suggest you move on.

28:33.977 --> 28:37.313
- Hey, now, Fischer...
- Now, inmate!

28:37.398 --> 28:38.732
Heh?

28:38.815 --> 28:40.817
All right. Jeez.

28:40.901 --> 28:44.946
But if he brings his own
chair, he can really hurt him.

28:45.030 --> 28:46.907
He can win!

28:46.990 --> 28:51.286
And return glory to our family.

28:55.331 --> 28:56.667
Ugh.

28:56.750 --> 29:00.003
- Oh, man!
- What is it?

29:00.086 --> 29:04.841
Salt. They gave us special
trays. Chili shittin' bitches!

29:04.925 --> 29:06.802
Man! They fuckin' with us
this way 'cause they know

29:06.885 --> 29:09.095
our people's predisposition
for hypertension.

29:09.179 --> 29:11.181
Man, they tryin' to kill us.

29:11.264 --> 29:14.601
Well, what do y'all expect?
Don't fuck with the cooks.

29:17.062 --> 29:18.397
What?

29:18.480 --> 29:20.899
Hey! Why I got it like that?
I didn't even do nothing.

29:20.982 --> 29:22.984
They're grouping us all together!

29:23.068 --> 29:26.572
It's called racism, slow bird.
What, was you just born or something?

29:26.655 --> 29:27.656
Shut up!

29:27.739 --> 29:31.618
The secret is pretend the salt is sugar.

29:34.287 --> 29:35.371
So, Bennett, I got a question.

29:35.456 --> 29:38.083
Would you rather live in a
house with a cracked foundation

29:38.166 --> 29:41.252
or one across from a parking lot
where the lights never go off?

29:42.337 --> 29:43.338
Neither.

29:43.422 --> 29:45.298
But what if nothing else
is in your price range?

29:46.299 --> 29:48.176
Hey! I want a new tray.

29:48.259 --> 29:50.804
Sorry. You get what you get.

29:50.887 --> 29:53.932
Bullshit! You can't mess with my
food! I wasn't part of that shit!

29:54.015 --> 29:55.016
Janae, calm down.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.393
Inmate. Hey!

29:57.478 --> 29:58.937
You cannot do that!

29:59.020 --> 30:00.105
Fuck!

30:00.188 --> 30:03.358
Get off me! Shut up!

30:03.442 --> 30:06.487
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.154
Get him off me!

30:08.238 --> 30:10.699
- You wanna go down the hill?
- No.

30:10.782 --> 30:12.951
Then you cut that shit out.

30:13.952 --> 30:16.329
You just lost commissary
for a month, inmate.

30:35.015 --> 30:38.101
You got a plan or are you
only trying to start shit?

30:38.184 --> 30:39.561
I'm handling it.

30:39.645 --> 30:42.689
You better. That's my
granddaughter in there.

30:50.572 --> 30:52.574

32:16.992 --> 32:18.994
_

32:19.494 --> 32:21.830
- Gloria Mendoza?
- Yeah.

32:21.913 --> 32:24.332
- This is your business?
- Yeah.

32:25.416 --> 32:28.378
Miss Mendoza, I have a
warrant for your arrest.

32:28.461 --> 32:30.463
You're under arrest for fraud.

32:30.546 --> 32:32.423
- What?
- Put your hands behind your back.

32:32.507 --> 32:33.675
_

32:33.800 --> 32:34.801
Get her out of here.

32:37.971 --> 32:40.348

_

32:42.851 --> 32:46.437

_

32:58.700 --> 33:02.871
_

33:02.954 --> 33:07.834
_

33:09.502 --> 33:11.212
_

33:21.139 --> 33:22.849
Give me a shot and a beer.

33:25.936 --> 33:27.478
It's $10.

33:50.501 --> 33:53.629
All right. Thank you. Thank you.

33:53.714 --> 33:55.590
We've got Gabe Ronley on drums.

33:57.008 --> 33:59.094
Got Joe Caputo on bass.

33:59.177 --> 34:01.137
John Glickman on guitar.

34:01.221 --> 34:04.808
I'm Albert Roth and we are Side Boob.

34:04.891 --> 34:09.437
This next song is called The Sorcerers.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.523
Otherwise known as John
Glickman is a Pedophile.

34:28.581 --> 34:32.627
We go to prison 20% longer for
the same crimes as white people.

34:32.710 --> 34:34.713
They can stop and frisk
us whenever they want,

34:34.795 --> 34:37.132
and now, when some bitch
fucks with our food,

34:37.215 --> 34:38.759
I'm the one who gets thrown on the ground?

34:38.842 --> 34:39.842
This shit ain't right.

34:39.926 --> 34:41.762
And don't forget they took your commissary.

34:41.844 --> 34:43.847
Be angry. Y'all need to be angry.

34:43.929 --> 34:48.309
Man, I would say we go on hunger strike,
but that shit's already happening.

34:48.393 --> 34:50.061
Yo, tortilla chick!

34:50.145 --> 34:51.478
Oh!

34:51.562 --> 34:54.315
Look like somebody took a wrong
turn on the way to the barrio.

34:54.399 --> 34:56.275
You and me in the bathroom, now.

34:58.694 --> 35:01.072
- I'll come with you.
- I got this.

35:02.365 --> 35:04.284
No, she shouldn't go alone.

35:04.367 --> 35:06.327
No, she'll be fine. Heel.

35:06.411 --> 35:10.791
Yeah, I put money on our girl
over that beanbag bitch any day.

35:10.874 --> 35:14.085
I don't know, man. Mendoza
be on that coconut magic.

35:14.169 --> 35:15.670
She's like a bruja and shit.

35:15.754 --> 35:18.173
I'll show her some coconut magic.

35:18.256 --> 35:22.510
Put a coconut in my sock.
Wham! Sock a nut, bitch!

35:25.931 --> 35:27.766
I'm just playing.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.561
You must got some real big feet.

35:31.644 --> 35:35.899
The fucking best song
in this fucking band...

35:35.982 --> 35:37.358
You wanna know what it is?

35:37.442 --> 35:41.487
Is the one with the guys
working in the fucking mine.

35:42.655 --> 35:46.534
That fucking song is like
a classic fucking song.

35:46.617 --> 35:52.290
That fucking song is a song
you hear on the fucking radio.

35:52.373 --> 35:57.212
Actually, that song is not
about workers in the mine.

35:57.295 --> 35:59.547
- What do you mean?
- No, it's a metaphor.

35:59.630 --> 36:02.175
Al wrote it about his vasectomy reversal.

36:02.258 --> 36:03.927
- No shit!
- Seriously.

36:06.137 --> 36:10.725
Hey, you guys got a CD? Please
tell me you got a fucking CD.

36:10.809 --> 36:11.893
Look at this.

36:11.977 --> 36:14.645
What do you look for in a state senator?

36:14.729 --> 36:17.315
- Mr. Fig.
- Mr. Fig.

36:20.193 --> 36:22.487
"Look, the reason I'm
the only one with a helmet

36:22.570 --> 36:24.906
"is 'cause I'm richer than you."

36:27.158 --> 36:30.786
"Hammering that nail was hard. I'm pooped."

36:30.871 --> 36:32.580
"Whee!"

36:32.663 --> 36:34.165
There she is.

36:34.249 --> 36:38.711
Behind every strong man is a
strong, cunt-faced witch monster.

36:38.794 --> 36:40.421
Let's get to work!

36:40.505 --> 36:42.257
"Let's get to work."

36:43.799 --> 36:45.593
Let me ask you something.

36:45.676 --> 36:48.096
When you first started,
Fig wasn't there, right?

36:48.179 --> 36:50.765
You talked directly to the warden?

36:50.849 --> 36:53.351
Yeah. It was great.

36:53.434 --> 36:55.561
Actually, he was fucking terrifying.

36:55.645 --> 36:57.898
But at least when you talked to
him, you were talking to a guy.

36:57.981 --> 37:00.650
I hate talking about
women's issues to women.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.443
It's creepy.

37:02.527 --> 37:05.030
When you talked to him, did he give a shit?

37:05.113 --> 37:07.615
Because I would really
like to report to someone

37:07.698 --> 37:12.037
who I felt gave a shit about these
women we're meant to be taking care of.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.414
- You want a tissue?
- No, I don't want a fucking tissue.

37:14.497 --> 37:16.291
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?

37:16.374 --> 37:17.542
All right.

37:18.709 --> 37:21.754
I mean, think about the
fucked up year we're having.

37:21.837 --> 37:24.132
We are failing here.

37:24.215 --> 37:27.969
I can't even get approval
to fix the fucking toilets.

37:30.096 --> 37:32.390
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's all right.

37:34.559 --> 37:40.106
I mean, the least we should do is
keep these women safe and clean.

37:40.190 --> 37:42.483
You know, you're right.

37:42.567 --> 37:43.609
You're right.

37:43.693 --> 37:45.820
- At least clean.
- At least clean.

37:45.904 --> 37:47.488
At least the women in the kitchen.

37:47.572 --> 37:50.783
At least those women in the
kitchen. Keep 'em fucking clean.

37:51.993 --> 37:54.996
Fuckin' A. Keep them fucking clean.

38:00.751 --> 38:02.337
Gloria, I was hoping
that we could be friends.

38:02.420 --> 38:06.299
You wanna fuck with me? You
don't wanna fuck with me.

38:06.382 --> 38:07.383
I gave you cigarettes.

38:07.467 --> 38:10.470
And I gave you cake. But that
don't mean that we're friends.

38:10.553 --> 38:12.722
And those cigarettes?
They were fucking stale.

38:12.805 --> 38:14.933
Listen, can we just talk
about this like responsible...

38:15.016 --> 38:18.979
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not
talking to you. I'm telling you.

38:19.062 --> 38:21.397
If any of your girls touches any of mine,

38:21.481 --> 38:23.816
there's gonna be more than
salt in your food next time.

38:23.899 --> 38:28.154
- Gloria...
- You understand me?

38:32.783 --> 38:34.119
Gloria, I don't want any trouble with you.

38:34.202 --> 38:36.662
I've been telling them, "Let's
just go use the Spanish bathroom."

38:36.746 --> 38:38.789
Suzanne can clean it.
And then she'll like that.

38:38.873 --> 38:42.002
And then you and your girls could
just take the ghetto bathroom.

38:42.085 --> 38:43.086
I'm on your side.

38:43.169 --> 38:46.047
Oh, you were gonna give us the bathroom?

38:47.090 --> 38:51.636
Bullshit, mama! Because you? You
don't got no bathroom to give.

38:55.640 --> 38:58.226
Oh, no, man. What the
fuck is wrong with you?

38:58.309 --> 38:59.644
I'm too old for this shit.

38:59.727 --> 39:03.023
I'm just too old for this shit.
That's what's wrong with me!

39:04.315 --> 39:05.941
Listen, hey, I don't even
know these girls, okay?

39:06.026 --> 39:07.986
And they want me to be some
kind of den mother, right?

39:08.069 --> 39:11.990
And I'm trying to work with you and
all you're trying to do is run over me.

39:12.073 --> 39:15.910
I'm trying to give you the
bathroom, okay? I'm a good talker...

39:17.287 --> 39:19.539
but I can't sell this shit
unless you give me something.

39:19.622 --> 39:22.542
- You gotta give me something.
- Like what?

39:22.625 --> 39:28.714
Taystee and Watson have been talking about
wanting to get transferred to custodial.

39:28.798 --> 39:30.258
- Custodial?
- Yeah.

39:30.341 --> 39:33.344
They wanna be with their girl,
that girl Cindy. I mean, you...

39:33.428 --> 39:35.888
There're a couple of
Spanish girls in custodial.

39:35.971 --> 39:38.433
Maybe you could talk
to Caputo and, you know,

39:38.516 --> 39:41.227
have them transferred to the kitchen.

39:42.437 --> 39:44.022
Maybe I could work with that.

39:45.356 --> 39:46.857
Huh?

39:46.941 --> 39:48.609
Oh, fuck, come on, man.

39:50.695 --> 39:51.862
Fine.

39:54.407 --> 39:56.576
Show me you could clear the bathroom,

39:58.119 --> 39:59.954
and then I'll talk to Caputo.

40:03.541 --> 40:07.128
And get yourself together 'cause,
Jesus, I didn't even fucking hit you.

40:20.391 --> 40:21.934
Mr. Healy, you wanted to see me?

40:22.017 --> 40:23.478
Door.

40:29.900 --> 40:33.363
I'm submitting you for
a three-day furlough.

40:33.446 --> 40:37.492
There are no guarantees, but I'm gonna
do my best to try to push it forward.

40:38.284 --> 40:40.661
I'm assuming that you're gonna
be staying with your fiancé.

40:40.745 --> 40:42.622
I need to write down an address.

40:43.956 --> 40:45.625
Yes. Of course.

40:48.378 --> 40:50.380
Would you like to call him to make sure?

40:50.463 --> 40:51.964
I'll call right away.

40:53.258 --> 40:55.510
Thank you, Mr. Healy.

40:55.593 --> 40:58.513
I think it's only fair we give it a shot.

40:58.596 --> 41:00.681
It's the least we can do.

41:04.352 --> 41:06.812
And, Chapman.

41:06.896 --> 41:08.773
I'm responsible for you.

41:16.114 --> 41:17.948
Hey! Joe!

41:18.032 --> 41:19.159
What's up, Healy?

41:19.242 --> 41:21.702
I had a lot of fun last
night. You guys were amazing.

41:21.786 --> 41:23.538
Right, thanks for coming out.

41:23.621 --> 41:25.165
I need you to sign this work transfer.

41:25.248 --> 41:27.542
I'm moving a couple of
girls from custodial.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.960
Flores and Sanchez.

41:30.044 --> 41:33.589
Okay. But won't that leave
custodial shorthanded?

41:33.673 --> 41:37.260
Yeah, we'll figure that out.
Mendoza needs help in the kitchen.

41:37.343 --> 41:38.386
Okay.

41:39.929 --> 41:42.265
I'm already looking
forward to next Tuesday.

41:42.348 --> 41:44.434
- Right.
- Side Boob Tuesdays.

41:44.517 --> 41:47.395
- Thanks, Healy.
- Good seeing you, Capu dawg.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.195
Chang, are you confirming these bangs,
or are you just taking her word for it?

41:55.278 --> 41:58.573
I don't smell fingers.
I just write numbers.

41:58.656 --> 42:01.492
She got five points. You, zilcho.

42:01.576 --> 42:03.035
All right, it's been three days.

42:03.118 --> 42:05.746
I mean, unless she's cloning
herself, that seems highly unlikely.

42:05.830 --> 42:06.914
It's just a game, Nichols.

42:06.997 --> 42:09.875
Yeah, but it's not a game
unless it's being played fairly.

42:09.959 --> 42:11.377
What's that smell?

42:11.461 --> 42:13.713
Nichols, you got a new fragrance?

42:13.796 --> 42:16.090
Oh, yeah, it's desperation.

42:16.174 --> 42:19.844
You might wanna wash because girls
turn right off when they smell that.

42:22.222 --> 42:24.307
My finger smells like an old tennis ball.

42:24.390 --> 42:28.644
God, I screwed myself. I mean, two
days I wasted on Officer Twat Tease.

42:28.728 --> 42:31.272
- You were too ambitious.
- I was arrogant.

42:31.356 --> 42:32.607
It's a classic story of hubris.

42:32.690 --> 42:35.651
I'm like Icarus whose wings melted
before he could fuck the sun.

42:35.735 --> 42:38.196
You could always tell
people she got herpes.

42:39.489 --> 42:41.115
It's good, isn't it? Eh?

42:41.199 --> 42:45.286
People always forget to
remember I'm tricksy, huh?

42:45.370 --> 42:46.621
It ain't over yet.

42:46.704 --> 42:49.332
- Ah, it's not over till it's over.
- Oh, I love that song.

42:49.415 --> 42:51.626
But herpes is way too pedestrian.

42:51.709 --> 42:53.628
Maybe I'll say it's
that new super gonorrhea.

42:53.711 --> 42:55.588
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

42:57.047 --> 42:59.509
- Excuse me, sir?
- Oh, Fischer. Good morning.

42:59.592 --> 43:01.427
Good morning, sir. Do you
mind if I ask you a question?

43:01.511 --> 43:02.595
Of course.

43:02.678 --> 43:04.472
It's about our surveillance.

43:06.891 --> 43:10.520
If it's about our video
cameras, they all work.

43:10.603 --> 43:12.563
That's what you should tell the inmates.

43:12.647 --> 43:14.315
Oh, no, it's about our phones.

43:14.399 --> 43:16.359
Do we have anyone who
monitors inmate calls?

43:16.442 --> 43:22.782
Well, it's all recorded in a computer.
We only review it when there's a reason.

43:22.865 --> 43:25.368
Don't you think we should
do random check-ins?

43:26.286 --> 43:27.995
Yes. And we do.

43:30.290 --> 43:34.669
Again, they should think we do.
But it's not exactly a priority.

43:34.752 --> 43:36.962
And half of those
conversations are in Spanish.

43:40.591 --> 43:47.139
Yo hablo español muy bueno, sir.

43:58.776 --> 43:59.819
Hello?

43:59.902 --> 44:03.281
An inmate from Litchfield Federal
Prison is attempting to contact you.

44:03.364 --> 44:05.741
To accept this call, please press "One."

44:08.619 --> 44:11.539
- Larry?
- Yes. Is everything all right?

44:11.622 --> 44:13.708
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.377
Is this a good time?

44:16.461 --> 44:18.128
Of course.

44:19.254 --> 44:23.426
My dad, he told me about
Chicago and the SHU.

44:24.552 --> 44:27.262
God, Piper, I'm so sorry.

44:27.347 --> 44:29.390
It's not your fault.

44:29.474 --> 44:32.518
Are you sure that this is a good time?
It sounds like you're going somewhere.

44:32.602 --> 44:34.269
No, no. I'm heading home.

44:34.354 --> 44:38.023
I was with Polly. We
finally had a bag-nut.

44:38.107 --> 44:39.734
What's a bag-nut?

44:39.817 --> 44:41.611
It's like a bagel crossed with a donut.

44:41.694 --> 44:44.780
It's this big craze right now.

44:44.864 --> 44:48.158
We had to wait in line
for, like, two hours for it.

44:48.242 --> 44:50.202
Turns out it's a bagel with frosting on it.

44:50.285 --> 44:53.038
I forgot what's it like to
have all that freedom to waste.

44:53.122 --> 44:57.126
Yep. I waste my freedom, but I
bring my own cup to Stumptown.

45:03.173 --> 45:05.676
Piper, why didn't you call sooner?

45:05.760 --> 45:07.177
We broke up?

45:09.930 --> 45:15.019
And I guess I've been imagining I could be
this person who doesn't depend on anybody.

45:16.437 --> 45:18.648
Or lets anybody depend on me.

45:23.110 --> 45:24.862
It's nice to hear your voice.

45:26.030 --> 45:28.533
Yeah, it's nice to hear your voice.

45:30.826 --> 45:32.745
I've missed you.

45:35.498 --> 45:37.207
I've missed you, too, Larry.

45:43.213 --> 45:44.840
Oh...

45:44.924 --> 45:46.258
It's not that bad.

45:46.341 --> 45:47.718
Man!

45:47.802 --> 45:49.512
Now we don't have to share with anyone.

45:49.595 --> 45:53.390
Segregation. Awesome.
Separate, but way shittier.

45:53.474 --> 45:58.145
Well, this is better in the long
run. Our own bathroom that we control.

45:58.228 --> 46:01.356
"Showers will be limited to 30 seconds"?

46:01.441 --> 46:04.026
Man, I can't even wash my
twat in that amount of time.

46:04.109 --> 46:06.446
- What? Vee!
- Trust me, baby girl.

46:06.529 --> 46:07.988
Man, I don't care.

46:08.072 --> 46:10.240
As long as I don't have
to wait in line anymore.

46:10.324 --> 46:13.160
I get one more shot for
being late, I'm back in SHU.

46:13.243 --> 46:14.829
I can't fucking handle that.

46:14.912 --> 46:16.121
You late, I'm late.

46:16.205 --> 46:19.625
Maybe black folk do got a
problem with bein' punctual.

46:19.709 --> 46:23.838
Taystee, Watson, about
your work assignments.

46:23.921 --> 46:25.255
Gonna be a little change.

46:31.721 --> 46:33.681
- So she's one today?
- Yeah.

46:33.764 --> 46:35.349
Why don't nobody bring her to visit?

46:35.432 --> 46:37.017
What, from Massachusetts? Forget it.

46:37.101 --> 46:40.145
You see, I told you you're
lucky your boyfriend's so close.

46:40.229 --> 46:41.396
Her kids are in Massachusetts

46:41.481 --> 46:43.315
and Gloria's kids is all
the way in fucking Florida.

46:43.398 --> 46:44.650
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:44.734 --> 46:47.069
Two boys are with their tía. Two
older girls are still in New York.

46:47.152 --> 46:48.821
But they never visit.

46:48.904 --> 46:50.490
- You guys wanna see this?
- Yeah.

46:50.573 --> 46:53.784
All right. I got the
wax from melting crayons

46:53.868 --> 46:55.786
and Dayanara drew the
picture of St. Anthony.

46:55.870 --> 46:58.789
You pray to him for protection
and strength and justice.

46:58.873 --> 47:00.332
For us and for baby.

47:00.415 --> 47:01.751
Juliana-Fernanda.

47:01.834 --> 47:04.211
- What's the orisha name for Saint Anthony?
- Orisha?

47:04.294 --> 47:07.673
You know, all the saints had, like,
stage names for the booga-booga gods,

47:07.757 --> 47:09.299
'cause, you know, the plantation owners,

47:09.383 --> 47:12.011
they didn't want the
slaves worshipping no more.

47:12.094 --> 47:14.013
The orisha is named Eleggua.

47:14.096 --> 47:16.807
- Yo, how'd you make the wick?
- I'll give you one guess.

47:17.975 --> 47:20.603
Do you really, like, believe
in this? Like, for real?

47:20.686 --> 47:22.730
- You Catholic?
- Yeah.

47:22.813 --> 47:24.231
Well, this is Catholic plus.

47:24.314 --> 47:25.608
Look, my tía says

47:25.691 --> 47:29.069
it doesn't matter if you're praying to
a giant cross or to a itty bitty stick,

47:29.153 --> 47:32.114
it's the faith that you
put in it that counts.

47:32.197 --> 47:35.576
Yeah, but do you believe in,
like, spells and magic and shit?

47:35.660 --> 47:39.246
I believe I can use all the help I can get.

47:39.329 --> 47:40.873
You're getting new girls in the kitchen?

47:40.956 --> 47:43.834
- You're not allowed back here.
- Did you put in a request?

47:43.918 --> 47:47.087
What if I did? We need the extra
help to keep up with the demand.

47:47.171 --> 47:48.505
She put you up to this.

47:48.589 --> 47:50.966
- She?
- Vee.

47:51.050 --> 47:53.093
You got the scuttlebutt ass backwards, Red.

47:53.177 --> 47:55.638
Gloria went in there and
told that bitch what's what.

47:55.721 --> 47:57.097
She played you.

47:57.181 --> 48:00.225
You have no idea what you've done.

48:14.531 --> 48:16.366
We're gonna start prepping for dinner.

48:17.367 --> 48:19.328
Wait. Aren't you supposed to keep it lit?

48:19.411 --> 48:20.580
You kidding?

48:21.872 --> 48:23.916
This shit is dangerous.

49:33.903 --> 49:36.155
No. No, no, no, no!

49:37.907 --> 49:42.286
No! No! No, no! Fuck! Fuck!
