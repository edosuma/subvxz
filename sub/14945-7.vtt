Wow, that's a neat trick.
What's the angle?

14:07.556 --> 14:10.343
Dead time travelers,
mysterious body snatchers,
you know, the usual.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.474

Carson Hirsch. Married,
with a daughter.

Works in real estate,
member of the Rotary Club...

14:22.112 --> 14:24.353
That doesn't exactly
scream Liber8 sympathizer.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.688
I agree.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.690
Is this where you call
Section 6?

Yep.

Well, he's good,
I'll give him that!

15:02.569 --> 15:04.400
What do you
make of his info?

15:04.488 --> 15:09.027
(SIGHS) We've got
a nervous juror, we got no
online presence,

15:09.117 --> 15:10.778

at the house...

15:11.620 --> 15:13.406

his family?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.373
If Carson's family
has been kidnapped,

15:18.460 --> 15:20.371

only one thing...

were sequestered.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.188

to check his e-mail.

Then we have to find out
what was in his inbox.

prior to being

16:09.177 --> 16:11.213

they sent the threat.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.823
It came from
a public hotspot in

17:20.373 --> 17:21.988
Yeah! You got it.
Thanks.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.040
That should get
us started.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.288
I should probably brief

do you think are moored
in Vancouver?

17:30.175 --> 17:33.042
(LAUGHING) Thousands.
Great.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.881
We have to inform
the court that the jury
has been compromised.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.299
I wouldn't do that.

17:37.933 --> 17:38.922
Why not?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.386
If the court dismisses
the jury for tampering,

17:41.478 --> 17:43.264

of no use to Liber8.

where they're keeping
the family.

All right, do it. Find
them before it's over,

17:54.324 --> 17:56.110
or I'll have no
choice but to report
to the judge.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.692

to go off the rails.

Detective Fonnegra do next,
Mrs. Randol?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.657

became very agitated.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.748
He said that Roland
was hiding things
from him.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.459
Julian heard the shouting,
and came running.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.503
And then, when he tried
to intervene,

18:15.011 --> 18:16.547
that's when the detective
drew his weapon.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.671

defending himself,

up a building!

hooked up to it,

you should?

initial tests on that

is advanced enough

19:40.180 --> 19:41.670
to shoulder the load
so to speak.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.427
So how is this going
to help us find
the family? The boat?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.550
There are too many images
of boats, schematics

19:48.605 --> 19:50.516
But hooked up
to my Arc program,
and this slice,

19:50.607 --> 19:52.313

able to motor through

of the ransom video,

is find a match.

One of your Section 6
body snatchers.

41:47.464 --> 41:50.376
I put him into
our database of over
170 countries.

41:50.801 --> 41:52.587
He's a ghost.
All right, maybe we can...

41:52.678 --> 41:55.590
No! Itracked that
ghost to a car
rental agency.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.172
There's only five
packing agencies
in the lower mainland

41:58.266 --> 42:01.474
that use that particular
model of compact
refrigeration vehicle.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.635
And you've
narrowed it down.

42:04.815 --> 42:06.271
I've even got an address.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.607
(INHALES) So...

42:13.198 --> 42:14.438
Are we gonna do this?

42:16.702 --> 42:18.283
You and me,
working together?

42:19.538 --> 42:20.778
Mmm-hmm.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.535
What have we
got to lose?

42:36.805 --> 42:37.794
Can I have a word?

42:37.973 --> 42:39.554
Sheriff, please remove
this young lady.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.303
I only wanted
to thank you
for your service.

42:42.978 --> 42:44.309
I don't know
what are you
talking about.

42:44.438 --> 42:46.099
Your sacrifice
for the cause.

42:46.690 --> 42:47.896
The movement?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.568
Get her out of here.

42:54.489 --> 42:55.649
(JUDGE GAGGING)
