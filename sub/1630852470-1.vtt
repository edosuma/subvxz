00:29.429 --> 00:30.797
Sonny...

00:30.830 --> 00:32.298
It's Christmas Eve,
you gotta stop

00:32.332 --> 00:33.166
rearranging the tree.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.167
I know, I know.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.435
I just--
[grunts]

00:35.468 --> 00:36.936
I want it to be perfect

00:36.970 --> 00:38.705
when we take our Christmas
Morning pictures.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.074
I don't know who's more
obsessed with Christmas,

00:41.107 --> 00:42.108
you or Ari.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.277
Oh! Speaking of,
is she's sleeping?

00:44.310 --> 00:45.645
Yeah, finally.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.579
Okay, great.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.580
I can start wrapping gifts.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.049
Okay, wait,
hold on, let me--

00:49.082 --> 00:50.383
Let me check something quick.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.021
Oh, boy.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.323
What?
What is it?

00:57.357 --> 00:59.159
You know how that
streaming service

00:59.192 --> 01:00.093
bought the rights
to my article

01:00.126 --> 01:01.361
about The Alamainian Peacock?

01:01.394 --> 01:02.696
[chuckles]
Of course.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.930
How can I forget?

01:03.963 --> 01:05.065
You helped them turn it
into a miniseries.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.132
Yeah, I also agreed

01:06.166 --> 01:07.901
to do a one episode special
for them.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.070
Oh, my God, honey.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.204
That's great.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.739
Well, yeah, I mean,
it would be, except

01:12.772 --> 01:14.307
um, I was expected
to turn in a draft

01:14.341 --> 01:17.344
by midnight tonight
and I haven't written a word.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.611
Oh, my God, what?
Why not?

01:18.645 --> 01:20.180
Well, I got

01:20.213 --> 01:21.381
deadlines at the paper,

01:21.414 --> 01:22.816
and there's chaos back home.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.551
I mean, can you ask
for an extension?

01:24.584 --> 01:25.618
I tried.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.153
And according the e-mail,

01:27.187 --> 01:28.588
they didn't buy my grandmother

01:28.621 --> 01:30.090
is possessed
by the devil excuse.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.827
I-- I'm afraid they're not gonna
want to work with me again.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.931
I mean, you still have a couple
of hours left until midnight.

01:37.964 --> 01:41.735
I can't write a whole movie
in that time.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.703
I mean, what if I help you?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.238
I don't even have a story idea!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.809
What about a Christmas movie?

01:51.644 --> 01:53.179
* *

02:58.278 --> 02:59.612
- Where would we start?
- Okay, well--

02:59.646 --> 03:02.048
All the best Christmas movies

03:02.048 --> 03:05.485
always take place in quaint
little towns,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.721
full of mom-and-pop shops,

03:07.754 --> 03:10.557
and lots of holiday cheer.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.126

TIS THE SEASON
THANK YOU

03:22.068 --> 03:22.736
SALEM INN

03:26.072 --> 03:28.441
Christmas cookies,
get your free sam--

03:28.475 --> 03:30.343
Hey, you!
One per customer!

03:30.377 --> 03:32.145
Uh, enjoy it, sir,

03:32.178 --> 03:33.346
and merry Christmas.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.148
Don't be a Scrooge, Dupree.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.751
What? I'm just saying
we have a business to run.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.586
- Come on, come on!
- Let-- just wait, just wait.

03:39.619 --> 03:42.088
- What?
- These cookies smell really,
really, really good.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.490
- No, no, no, no.
- Really good.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.425
Excuse me, oh, we have
so much work to do, come on.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.659
Gabi!

03:48.094 --> 03:49.195
Dear.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.431
It's my order ready?

03:51.464 --> 03:52.832
Oh, yes, uh...
Your order.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.735
I'm so sorry, I have been
swamped and...

03:55.769 --> 03:57.604
I've been going crazy
trying to find

03:57.637 --> 03:59.739
those VR goggles
that Ari wants from Santa so...

04:01.941 --> 04:04.477
I will have those dresses
to you by Christmas.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.047
Well, hopefully you do.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.616
Or I'll have to take
my business elsewhere.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.086
[people chattering]

04:18.425 --> 04:19.626
[sighs]

04:21.428 --> 04:23.129
Hey, honey, I was thinking.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.165
You know, might just
increase our business

04:25.198 --> 04:28.234
if we were to decorate a little
bit more for the holidays.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.070
Make it more festive.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.872
Mom, you know
how I hate Christmas.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.774
Okay, wait, why do
she hates Christmas?

04:34.808 --> 04:38.445
Because there's always
some tragic backstory,

04:38.478 --> 04:40.447
like someone she loved

04:40.480 --> 04:42.982
died on Christmas
many years ago.

04:43.083 --> 04:43.883
[chuckles]

04:43.917 --> 04:45.819
Someone she loved...

04:55.228 --> 04:56.262
[sighs]

04:57.764 --> 05:02.035
You know, your dad would hate it
if he knew he was the reason

05:02.035 --> 05:04.070
for you losing
your Christmas spirit.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.206
It's not just that,

05:06.239 --> 05:08.375
um, Christmas is not
the way it used to be.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.177
It's all been coopted
by big businesses now,

05:11.211 --> 05:14.080
it's all about materialism
and greed.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.448
Doesn't have to be.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.818
It can be about...

05:18.852 --> 05:21.321
love, caring.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.922
Merry Christmas.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.958
Oh, Sydney, merry Christmas!

05:25.058 --> 05:26.226
- Look at you--
- Oh.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.394
Can I have a hug?

05:27.427 --> 05:28.361
- Sure.
- Oh!

05:30.296 --> 05:31.364
Hello, Samantha.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.566
Merry Christmas, EJ.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.701
[chuckles]

05:35.969 --> 05:37.704
Aw, look at you.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.072
Mm.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.473
What a pretty dress you have.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.642
Thanks, my mommy
bought it for me.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.412
[sing-song]
Custom made for her in Italy.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.215
Hi, sweetheart.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.451
[kiss]

05:51.484 --> 05:52.652
Sorry I'm late.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.453
[chuckles]

05:53.486 --> 05:54.521
Looks like you bought out

05:54.554 --> 05:55.889
the entire haul
in town square.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.357
Oh, well, what can I say,

05:57.390 --> 05:58.958
I was in the holiday spirit.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.494
I mean, who doesn't
love Christmas?

06:01.528 --> 06:02.562
Oh, sorry.

06:03.630 --> 06:07.534
I mean, I know it's a hard
time of the year for you.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.070
If I remember correctly,

06:10.103 --> 06:12.706
Sami, your father died
on Christmas,

06:12.739 --> 06:15.475
and, Marlena,
your beloved husband.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.180
[laughing]

06:20.213 --> 06:21.815
Merry Christmas, kids!

06:21.848 --> 06:23.116
How's the cookie business?

06:23.149 --> 06:24.384
Well, dad,
you gotta try these.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.086
These are fantastic, right here.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.487
Maybe later, son.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.457
I have got an inn to run.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.065
[phone ringing]

06:46.339 --> 06:47.474
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa...

06:47.507 --> 06:49.542
[phone ringing]

06:49.576 --> 06:52.078
Salem Inn,
John Black speaking.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.420
Sure, I think we may have an
opening for that weekend.

07:00.453 --> 07:03.456
Just a second,
hold on a second.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.794
Honey, do you know where the
reservation book is?

07:07.827 --> 07:10.096
WOMAN: Hold your horses,
I've got it right here.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.699
Ah...

07:14.200 --> 07:16.436
What would I do without
my darling wife?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.282
* *

07:31.518 --> 07:34.387
WOMAN: Like sands
through the hourglass,

07:34.421 --> 07:37.190
so are the Days of Our Lives.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.628
A VERY SALEM CHRISTMAS

07:43.563 --> 07:47.334
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho!

08:01.014 --> 08:04.884
Okay, so,
EJ is married to Nicole...

08:04.918 --> 08:06.019
Mm-hm.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.554
And then John
is married to Kristen

08:07.587 --> 08:09.089
and your grandma Marlena is...

08:09.122 --> 08:10.490
Is the lonely widow.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.093
Are you intentionally
trolling your family?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.627
Is for the benefit
of the story.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.262
Yeah, but all these
Christmas movies,

08:16.296 --> 08:18.131
they're about, you know, love.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.666
Yeah, what's a good love story

08:19.699 --> 08:21.701
without some twist
and turns?

08:21.735 --> 08:22.502
Mm-hm.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.236
Those look good.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.575
Hey, you're eating
all of our samples.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.677
I'm so sorry.
They're just really good.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.813
Okay, why don't you come inside
and buy a dozen or so?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.682
I should, but I'm--

08:35.715 --> 08:37.283
I'm actually late for something,
I gotta go.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.185
Take this one for the road.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.854
Merry Christmas, thank you,
these are so good.

08:40.887 --> 08:43.256
- Hey--
- Cheap-ass mother...

08:43.289 --> 08:45.058
Eh-eh-eh... Mm.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.627
Hey, look, it is your boyfriend.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.863
Ah, what happened
to all the samples?

08:49.896 --> 08:51.698
Brady cleared us out.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.266
- Oh, that's cold.
- Yeah.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.569
But, don't worry, I saved
something sweet...

08:56.603 --> 08:58.405
for my man.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.643
[sighs]

09:03.677 --> 09:04.811
Gross.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.646
You said it, sis.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.152
You'd think Sydney
doesn't have any dresses.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.820
Did you see how many
bags Nicole had with her?

09:13.853 --> 09:15.055
Lot of bags.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.122
All right.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.257
Cappuccino?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.526
With a touch of cinnamon.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.895
- Oh...
- Just the way you like it.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.897
You're a lifesaver.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.031
What are best friends for?

09:25.031 --> 09:26.199
Mm.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.500
Ah...

09:27.534 --> 09:30.036
Wait, okay, I'm-- um...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.338
Gabi and Nick?

09:31.371 --> 09:32.839
- They're best friends?
- Yeah.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.208
Why is Nick even
a character in the story?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.711
Well, because he's part
of the family, you know?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.146
And, uh, he moved back
to get to know us Hortons

09:40.180 --> 09:43.416
and I saw a kinder,
gentler side of him.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.885
Before he tormented
you and Gabi

09:45.919 --> 09:47.587
and completely went
over the edge?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.823
Yes, obviously before that.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.825
Okay, you--
you are the writer.

09:51.858 --> 09:55.395
Yes, I am the writer
who's on a roll thanks to you.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.564
Thank you, okay, so,
moving right along.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.566
Okay, so, uh...

09:59.599 --> 10:03.069
This new and improved
and sweeter and gentler Nick

10:03.103 --> 10:04.938
is secretly in love
with his best friend.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.474
Yes, and even though
he's perfect for her

10:07.507 --> 10:10.443
and he's right under
her nose, she can't see it.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.345
Because...

10:12.379 --> 10:15.548
Because she has a crush
on someone else.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.052
Christmas greetings one at all.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.521
- Brady, you're here!
- Why, why--

10:21.554 --> 10:22.822
Why are you here?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.091
Oh. I'm here for my fitting,
of course.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.593
I'm making him
a bespoke suit.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.294
- Oh, now?
- Mm-hm.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.130
Well, no, it's just, um...

10:30.163 --> 10:31.631
She was just--
she was talking about--

10:31.664 --> 10:33.600
You were talking
about how swamped--

10:33.633 --> 10:34.868
We're really swamped.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.003
No, I always have time
for my favorite customer.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.104
Are you kidding me?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.305
Oh, you're gonna look
so handsome.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.407
Even more handsome.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.308
I don't even know
if that's possible.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.643
You....

10:43.677 --> 10:44.811
You're so kind.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.613
Ah, let me get
my measuring tape.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.348
- Thanks.
- Okay.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.056
Sydney, I was cleaning
out some closets upstairs.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.793
I found all these supplies
for making homemade ornaments.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.327
I'm not gonna
have a Christmas tree

11:01.361 --> 11:03.630
so I thought
you might like them.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.597
Thank you, Sami.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.832
Okay...

11:07.600 --> 11:09.636
Is there a problem?

11:09.669 --> 11:13.073
Oh, we don't have room
for homemade ornaments.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.574
Mom.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.076
Honey, you know
how we feel about glitter

11:16.076 --> 11:18.078
and it takes
months to clean it up.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
Oh, the horror.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.448
[chuckles]

11:21.481 --> 11:22.749
Sorry.
[clears throat]

11:22.782 --> 11:24.417
I-- I should have asked first.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.254
Uh, how's-- how's business?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.724
Oh, um, yeah.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.359
Well, um, you know,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.094
it's just hard staying
afloat these days.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.098
I'm so sorry, I know how much
this pub means to you.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.100
Yeah.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.469
Yeah, my grandparents
built it from nothing and...

11:42.502 --> 11:44.137
passed it on to my dad.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.438
[clicks tongue]

11:45.472 --> 11:47.607
It must be rough.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.610
Letting down multiple
generations of your family.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.277
Nicole.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.512
I'm just saying,

11:52.545 --> 11:55.115
you must feel an enormous
amount of pressure.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.150
Ooh.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.687
You know what?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.623
Sami's been doing
a fabulous job

12:03.656 --> 12:05.425
and-- and Sean, Caroline,

12:05.458 --> 12:07.394
even Roman would be so
proud of you.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.195
Thanks, mom.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.364
Oh, I found this outside,

12:11.398 --> 12:12.799
it's-- it's got
your name on it.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.401
Oh, I'm sure
it's just a bill.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.468
[chuckles]

12:19.172 --> 12:20.407
The heck is this?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.644
What the heck is this?

12:26.446 --> 12:27.781
The heck is this?

12:29.616 --> 12:31.351
What the heck is this?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.486
Wait, what the heck is it?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.221
It's an eviction notice.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.590
What?

12:40.126 --> 12:42.595
It says that I have
to close up the pub.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.264
I have to be outta here
before Christmas.

12:46.099 --> 12:46.833
[breathing heavily]

12:48.335 --> 12:49.536
SONNY: Mm, okay.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.738
Okay, harsh,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.006
but I see what you were doing.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.508
The eviction connects
the stories together.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.543
Exactly.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.713
So who is the big bad Scrooge?

12:59.746 --> 13:03.283
The evil villain trying
to toss our heroes

13:03.316 --> 13:04.884
out onto the streets?

13:04.918 --> 13:06.786
Well, it needs
to be a total diva.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.588
[laughing]

13:08.621 --> 13:09.889
I know who it should be.

13:10.957 --> 13:11.958
Wow, wow.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.328
[chuckles]

13:15.362 --> 13:16.796
Watch out, Salem.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.099
Price Town is back.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.402
It'll be
the best Christmas ever.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.604
[laughing]

13:32.912 --> 13:35.081
Mary, I need you
in my office now.

13:36.182 --> 13:41.354
1001, 1002, 1003, 1000--

13:41.388 --> 13:42.355
Yes, Miss Price.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.656
You're not Mary.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.358
You fired Mary last week.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.460
I'm Leo, her replacement.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.662
Wait, okay, I'm sorry.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.898
Leo Stark is in the story?

13:51.931 --> 13:53.366
Yeah.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.102
Every villain needs
a weaselly henchman, right?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.838
And they don't make 'em
any weasellier

13:58.872 --> 14:00.273
than Leo Stark.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.843
No lies detected, proceed.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.345
- Mary!
- [gasps]

14:05.378 --> 14:06.746
Leo, ma'am.

14:06.780 --> 14:07.947
Whatever.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.150
Did you deliver
all the eviction notices?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.651
- I did.
- [chuckles]

14:11.685 --> 14:13.687
Wish I could've seen
the look

14:13.720 --> 14:16.556
on the faces
of all those losers.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.825
Wah, wah!

14:18.858 --> 14:19.826
[laughing]

14:19.859 --> 14:20.960
Ah, once they're out,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.462
there will be nothing
to stop me

14:22.495 --> 14:25.365
from leveling this town
and achieving my dream.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.768
'Cause who doesn't love
a big impersonal discount store?

14:28.802 --> 14:30.670
[laughing]

14:30.704 --> 14:33.440
You silly little elf,

14:33.473 --> 14:36.910
Price Town isn't just
a store anymore,

14:36.943 --> 14:38.578
it's a concept.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.148
It's luxury condos,
exclusive restaurants,

14:42.182 --> 14:43.817
a whole new way of life,

14:43.850 --> 14:47.587
not just rinky-dinky
mom-and-pop shops.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.924
Price Town is going
to reinvent Salem, USA.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.792
And make me hella rich
in the process.

14:52.826 --> 14:55.995
That does sound fabulous, boss.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.566
But if I may, there's just
one teeny tiny hiccup.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.435
You're going to give me bad
news?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.104
'Cause I don't like
bad news, Mary.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.240
Leo, and it seems
that the property

15:07.273 --> 15:08.575
stretching from the Horton
Town Square

15:08.608 --> 15:09.776
all the way to the Brady Pub

15:09.809 --> 15:12.245
sits on specially
designated land.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.047
Designated by whom?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.049
The Office
of Historic Preservation?

15:16.049 --> 15:19.419
That doesn't sound like
a teeny tiny hiccup.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.055
That sounds like a biggie,
largie hiccup.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.156
Well, I'm sorry, but I--

15:23.189 --> 15:25.125
[grunts]
Ow!

15:25.158 --> 15:26.426
What was that for?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.361
I don't like hearing problems!

15:28.395 --> 15:30.230
I like hearing solutions!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.064
Fix it, Mary!

15:31.097 --> 15:32.799
- How?
- Well, uh--

15:32.832 --> 15:37.070
By doing what I do
with everything.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.341
Throw money at it.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.112
EVICTION NOTICE

15:46.146 --> 15:48.114
Why would your mother
be shutting us down?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.617
Ever since Abe ended things
with her,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.086
Mom has gone
full blown Cruella.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.855
We put our heart and
soul into that bakery.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.424
I'm sorry, guys.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.092
I mean, this is just--

15:59.092 --> 16:00.226
This is devastating.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.029
Is it though?

16:03.029 --> 16:04.097
What do you mean?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.565
Look, don't get me wrong,

16:05.598 --> 16:08.535
opening the bakery with
you has been amazing, but...

16:08.568 --> 16:11.237
I don't know, I--
Real talk?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.107
I'm tired of waking up at the
butt crack of dawn every day?

16:14.140 --> 16:17.043
And, I don't, know I've been
itching to travel again.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.646
You know the, uh, Italian Alps

16:19.679 --> 16:21.247
are breathtaking
this time of year.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.784
Ooh, I've always
wanted to go there.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.686
I'm not sure if I can
get time off.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.655
I understand.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.123
They must really
rely on you

16:30.156 --> 16:31.391
down at the free clinic

16:31.424 --> 16:32.359
you're helping
so many people.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.960
For free.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.762
Aw, it's not
about the money.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.564
Mm, kinda is, though.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.233
I mean, I-- I just want
the world to acknowledge you

16:40.266 --> 16:41.468
for your talents.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.069
You know, the way I do.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.337
Aw.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.107
- Thanks, pookie
- Of course, pookie.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.077
I think I'm gonna pukie.

16:51.077 --> 16:52.445
You and me both.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.084
I think I'm going to throw up.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.619
There must be
some way to fight this.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.655
Miss Price owns this property.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.656
I don't know what I can do.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.925
We, Gabi, all right?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.862
No matter what happens,
we're in this together.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.297
Yep.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.235
Look at me.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.037
You're a talented,

17:17.070 --> 17:18.438
bright young woman.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.040
Okay?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.074
You have so much promise,

17:21.107 --> 17:22.409
you're gonna
weather this storm.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.344
You really think so?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.847
I know so and I'm rarely
if ever wrong, okay?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.082
All right.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.417
Um, about my fitting,
can we?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.818
You know what?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.354
I'm just thinking
the timing on that

17:34.387 --> 17:37.057
might not be perfect.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.459
Yeah, I noticed the mood
has changed a little bit,

17:39.492 --> 17:41.361
Oh, do you really know
how to read a room?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.264
We'll reschedule.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.699
I-- I'll call you, yes,

17:45.732 --> 17:46.800
I will call you,

17:46.833 --> 17:48.234
so we can figure out
the fitting.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.836
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to get it done

17:49.869 --> 17:50.904
by Christmas Eve, though?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.539
I mean, just in case
you close--

17:52.572 --> 17:55.408
Okay, that's like
a week from now.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.844
[laughing]
I mean, it's just--

17:57.877 --> 18:00.513
There's-- there's higher things
on-- on your priority list.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.315
Okay, no problem,
I'll get it done.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.251
Gabi.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.753
Yes?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.321
You are the best.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.589
Oh...

18:14.894 --> 18:17.497
JOHN: Booted out at Christmas?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.532
Honey, I know how much
you love our little inn.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.901
We still have each other.

18:23.036 --> 18:25.305
And we'll get through it.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.706
Together.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.047
Oh, get a room you two,

18:34.047 --> 18:35.648
but you got plenty
to choose from.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.117
Not for long.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.685
We just found out
we're getting evicted.

18:39.753 --> 18:40.920
You too.

18:40.954 --> 18:41.821
What do you mean?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.189
I just heard that Gabi,

18:43.223 --> 18:45.925
she and Sweet Bits,
they got eviction notices too.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.129
Seems Paulina Price is dumping
all of her tenants at once.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.697
I wonder if that means

18:50.730 --> 18:52.298
the pub is getting
shut down too.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.368
I'm so sorry, Samantha.

18:56.770 --> 18:58.204
Bad things happen at Christmas.

18:58.238 --> 18:58.972
You know?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.006
It's when my dad died.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.741
It's when Lucas ran off

19:01.775 --> 19:04.444
with a drippy Chloe
to Antarctica.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.415
Well, I for one, love Christmas,

19:08.448 --> 19:10.417
the extravagant parties,

19:10.450 --> 19:12.018
the lavish gifts.

19:12.052 --> 19:13.920
That's not really
what it's about, mommy.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.456
I can't wait to see
what EJ gets me this year.

19:17.791 --> 19:22.128
Oh, I have my eye on this
exquisite sapphire necklace.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.564
Nicole, maybe we should
be a little more sensitive

19:24.597 --> 19:26.466
to what Samantha and
Marlena are going through?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.668
I'm sorry,
am I being insensitive?

19:28.702 --> 19:32.272
Yes, I love the pub and I don't
want it to go away.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.808
Oh, neither do I, Syd.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.243
Excuse me, I'm--

19:37.277 --> 19:39.279
I'm gonna make a call

19:39.312 --> 19:42.782
and see if I can get
some help with this.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.319
[sighs]

19:49.255 --> 19:51.891
Oof, oof!

20:02.302 --> 20:05.005
We're going to need
some help down here.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.909
Maybe even a Christmas miracle.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.253
John.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.756
Hello, Marlena.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.826
Oh, I see.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.094
You got the same eviction.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.229
Yeah.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.466
Certainly was
a kick in the gut, but...

20:33.500 --> 20:37.504
thankfully, I have
Kristen lean on.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.675
KRISTEN: Brady.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.983
I thought you left
with your father.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.886
I forgot
that I have a gift for you.

20:54.888 --> 20:56.589
You wanna open it?

21:08.335 --> 21:09.903
[moaning]

21:17.444 --> 21:19.546
* *

21:28.755 --> 21:30.590
SALEM INN

21:34.260 --> 21:36.296
ONE WEEK LATER...

21:36.329 --> 21:37.597
[door opens]

21:37.630 --> 21:38.431
MARLENA: Oof!

21:40.367 --> 21:41.935
Good morning, Marlena.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.005
John.

21:45.105 --> 21:47.173
What brings you
by the Salem Inn?

21:47.207 --> 21:51.478
Uh. Oh, I was in
the neighborhood and...

21:51.511 --> 21:53.146
I-- I thought I would drop off

21:53.179 --> 21:55.248
your Christmas card in person.

21:56.316 --> 21:56.950
Oh, thank you.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.018
That's so nice.

21:58.118 --> 21:59.119
Yeah.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.257
Kristen and I
have one for you also.

22:06.126 --> 22:08.061
Oh, thanks.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.631
Where is your wife
this morning?

22:11.664 --> 22:12.799
She wasn't feeling well.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.100
Took the morning off.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.469
Nothing serious, I hope.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.671
No, no.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.272
I'm sure she'll be
feeling much better

22:19.305 --> 22:21.174
after she spends
some time in bed.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.411
[moaning]

22:24.444 --> 22:28.548
Merry freaking Christmas!

22:29.749 --> 22:31.251
[Brady laughing]

22:31.284 --> 22:34.354
And happy freaking New year.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.857
[moaning]

22:39.526 --> 22:40.694
You know what?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.662
I know Christmas Eve
isn't till tomorrow.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.366
I think now is a good time
to give you your gift.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.535
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

22:48.568 --> 22:53.106
You have been giving me
fantastic gifts all week long,

22:53.139 --> 22:55.141
not to mention the amazing
gift you just gave me.

22:55.175 --> 22:56.343
- You know--
- Just, please,

22:56.376 --> 22:57.677
let a girl catch her breath?

22:57.711 --> 22:59.245
I'm talking--

22:59.279 --> 23:00.480
I'm talking about...

23:00.513 --> 23:02.315
an actual

23:02.349 --> 23:03.516
gift.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.386
[sniffles]

23:06.419 --> 23:09.222
- What's that?
- Open it and find out.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.490
No.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.293
What do you mean "no"?
Why not?

23:13.326 --> 23:15.295
Because...

23:15.328 --> 23:18.631
our relationship
is built on lust.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.968
And, um, romantic
gestures just...

23:22.068 --> 23:23.403
complicate things.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.804
[sighs]
Look.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.272
Kristen, I know that's
where we started.

23:26.306 --> 23:28.875
John is my husband
and I love him.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.878
Do you?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.813
I mean, do you?
Do you really?

23:33.847 --> 23:35.682
He makes me feel safe.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.983
Safe.

23:38.218 --> 23:40.687
When did safe become
a priority of yours?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.755
Come on, what about--

23:41.788 --> 23:43.423
What about passion?
What about--

23:43.456 --> 23:44.924
I like things
the way they are.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.529
Are you really ever
going to be content

23:49.562 --> 23:52.098
with just being
an innkeeper's wife, Kristen?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.733
I mean, come on,
you want more.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.901
Don't you want more?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.202
Not from you.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.105
I'm sorry.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.376
I just don't want your gifts.

24:03.410 --> 24:04.477
I don't want your money.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.646
I don't want anything else

24:06.680 --> 24:08.081
that's going on
in that brain of yours.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.849
- I see.
- All I want is this.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.321
So, basically, what I am
to you is just a hard...

24:15.355 --> 24:16.656
Body.

24:16.690 --> 24:17.857
Yeah.

24:20.060 --> 24:21.261
And if you can't accept that,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.430
then I guess you're just
gonna have to move on.

24:32.072 --> 24:34.274
- Looks pretty good.
- Yeah.

24:37.344 --> 24:38.578
How you doing?

24:40.113 --> 24:42.082
I-- I mean,
I know this is a...

24:43.516 --> 24:46.086
a rough time of year for you.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.226
Well, I miss Roman.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.463
I guess they always will.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.166
May I ask you something?

25:01.201 --> 25:02.535
Of course.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.637
Why haven't you moved on?

25:06.039 --> 25:08.441
I mean, I'm--
I'm sure there are...

25:10.310 --> 25:13.713
Must be someone out there
for you somewhere.

25:16.216 --> 25:17.584
[door slams]

25:17.617 --> 25:19.853
[laughing]
Good morning people.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.721
How we feeling today?

25:21.755 --> 25:23.857
Well, not great,
Miss Price.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.692
Fabulous, fabulous.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.827
Just passing through
with a friendly reminder

25:27.861 --> 25:29.462
that you need
to be out by Christmas.

25:29.496 --> 25:31.531
We hadn't forgotten.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.899
Mm-hm, good, good.
[chuckles]

25:32.932 --> 25:35.402
You know, Paulina.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.437
You can evict us.

25:37.470 --> 25:38.972
You can...

25:39.072 --> 25:40.173
throw us out on the street,

25:40.206 --> 25:42.075
but the city will never
let you destroy

25:42.075 --> 25:44.544
these historic sites
for your precious Price Town

25:44.577 --> 25:45.578
and that's a fact.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.946
[chuckles]
Well...

25:46.980 --> 25:50.083
I wouldn't
be too sure about that.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.456
OFFICE OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION

26:00.827 --> 26:02.162
MAN: Come in.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.032
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.834
My name is Leo Stark
and I was hoping

26:07.867 --> 26:09.035
we could have a little chat.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.240
Hello, Mr. Stark.

26:15.275 --> 26:16.409
How can I help you?

26:20.447 --> 26:22.115
Oh, so, so, Xander

26:22.148 --> 26:23.783
runs the Office
of Historic Preservation.

26:23.817 --> 26:26.519
- Yeah, I like casting its type.
- Mm.

26:26.553 --> 26:29.155
Plus, Leo's always
had a crush on Xander

26:29.189 --> 26:30.390
and I thought

26:30.423 --> 26:32.392
it might be fun for those
two to cross again.

26:32.425 --> 26:35.061
- Yeah, fun for Leo anyway.
- Yeah.

26:45.572 --> 26:46.606
[sighs]

26:51.678 --> 26:52.879
There's something wrong,
Mr. Stark?

26:52.912 --> 26:55.482
No, it's just--

26:55.515 --> 26:57.484
Office of Historic Preservation,

26:57.517 --> 27:00.020
I was expecting
some old creaky relic,

27:00.020 --> 27:02.155
not a big strapping hunk.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.356
Is there something
I can do for you?

27:04.657 --> 27:06.526
I want to answer that
in so many ways.

27:06.559 --> 27:07.727
I'm sorry?

27:08.928 --> 27:10.130
Let me start over.

27:10.163 --> 27:11.798
My boss, Paulina Price--

27:11.831 --> 27:13.133
Oh, you work for
Miss Price.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.768
Yes, and she submitted

27:14.801 --> 27:16.736
a proposal for new construction?

27:16.770 --> 27:18.638
Mm, I'm-- I'm aware,

27:18.672 --> 27:22.409
I'm afraid that
I'm going to have to...

27:22.442 --> 27:23.810
decline her request.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.078
What, why?

27:25.111 --> 27:26.813
Why?

27:26.846 --> 27:30.550
Your boss's plans for Salem
are unethical and offensive.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.452
She'd be tearing out
the very heart of this town.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.787
Okay.

27:35.055 --> 27:38.058
So what if she made
a donation to your office?

27:38.091 --> 27:39.826
A very generous one.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.593
Cash.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.431
Is this a bribe?

27:44.464 --> 27:46.099
More like an incentive?

27:46.132 --> 27:48.368
A gift for a job well done?

27:49.469 --> 27:51.071
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

27:51.071 --> 27:52.605
It's a lot of money.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.309
Some things are
more important than money.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.079
Like what?

27:59.079 --> 28:01.448
Are you aware that some
of these businesses

28:01.481 --> 28:03.016
have been around for over
50 years?

28:03.049 --> 28:05.018
Then isn't it time
for a change?

28:05.018 --> 28:06.486
New businesses
can be cheaper to run.

28:07.587 --> 28:10.457
Look, I'm all for progress
and innovation.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.826
But it must honor the--
the history of this town.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.929
These places that your boss
wants to tear down,

28:16.029 --> 28:19.165
they aren't...
just relics of the past.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.934
They're the soul of Salem.

28:21.034 --> 28:23.103
They're bringing
the community together,

28:23.136 --> 28:26.072
uniting people from
all walks of life

28:26.106 --> 28:29.242
and those experiences
and traditions are

28:29.275 --> 28:31.544
passed down from
one generation to the next,

28:31.578 --> 28:33.380
providing a common
thread for all the people

28:33.413 --> 28:34.814
that live in this town.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.453
So your boss wouldn't
just be tearing down buildings,

28:40.487 --> 28:41.721
she would be demolishing

28:41.755 --> 28:44.057
the connective tissue
of Salem itself.

28:47.527 --> 28:49.229
So...

28:49.262 --> 28:50.897
Is that a definite no?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.069
DENIED

29:03.643 --> 29:05.178
NICOLE: Sydney, honey don't run,

29:05.211 --> 29:06.746
you're gonna ruin your shoes

29:06.780 --> 29:09.282
EJ can you please
talk to your daughter

29:09.315 --> 29:11.618
and ask her to please
act more like--

29:11.651 --> 29:13.019
What?

29:13.053 --> 29:14.821
What are you doing?

29:14.854 --> 29:16.456
EJ.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.491
I'm just helping
the poor man out.

29:18.525 --> 29:21.327
He's just gonna spend it
on drugs and alcohol.

29:21.361 --> 29:22.862
You don't know that.

29:24.664 --> 29:26.232
Where's your Christmas spirit?

29:27.300 --> 29:29.269
Or perhaps I would be
more festive

29:29.302 --> 29:30.670
if we didn't have to keep coming

29:30.704 --> 29:32.472
to this dreadful hole
in the wall

29:32.505 --> 29:35.108
that is run by her ex.

29:36.810 --> 29:38.244
Sydney loves it here

29:38.278 --> 29:40.480
and she loves spending time
with Samantha.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.216
Sydney.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.187
Santa pancakes!

29:47.220 --> 29:48.688
I made them especially
for you.

29:48.722 --> 29:50.190
Okay...

29:51.424 --> 29:53.126
You got this, and we have--
That's for you.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.227
[Nicole gasps]

29:54.260 --> 29:56.396
Sydney DiMera
put that fork down.

29:57.697 --> 29:59.065
What's the problem?

29:59.065 --> 30:02.268
Uh, it's loaded with sugar
and carbs is the problem.

30:02.302 --> 30:03.737
Sweetheart, it's almost
Christmas

30:03.770 --> 30:05.572
and Samantha already went
through all that trouble.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.342
Well, she could have asked me.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.312
Come on, Sydney,
honey come over here

30:12.345 --> 30:14.280
and we'll get you
something healthy to eat.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.449
Good girl.

30:19.152 --> 30:21.154
Uh, sorry...

30:21.187 --> 30:22.689
about overstepping again.

30:22.722 --> 30:24.424
No, no, you didn't do
anything wrong.

30:25.425 --> 30:26.793
You're wonderful with her.

30:28.728 --> 30:29.863
I just think Nicole gets

30:29.896 --> 30:30.964
a little threatened
by that sometimes.

30:34.768 --> 30:35.969
What is it?

30:37.203 --> 30:40.473
It's-- it's just sometimes
when I look at the date.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.108
Can't help but think about...

30:42.142 --> 30:43.843
Our daughter?

30:45.879 --> 30:47.647
Grace would have been
the same age.

30:48.982 --> 30:50.383
I'm so sorry, Samantha.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.253
I miss her too.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.802
SWEET BITS BAKERY
CLOSED

31:10.170 --> 31:12.772
Hey, isn't it a little early
to pack it in?

31:12.806 --> 31:15.342
Well, we're getting
evicted anyway

31:15.375 --> 31:17.310
so I was in the mood
for some shopping.

31:17.344 --> 31:19.379
That is an excellent idea.

31:19.412 --> 31:21.948
I have my eye on this new watch.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.117
Ooh, I want a new watch too.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.352
It's Christmas.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.220
You're supposed to get gifts
for other people.

31:27.253 --> 31:30.857
Okay, but isn't loving yourself
the greatest gift of all?

31:30.890 --> 31:33.760
See?
Now, she gets me.

31:33.793 --> 31:36.796
How about we go
ice skating at the park?

31:36.830 --> 31:37.964
Ooh, yes, yes.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.366
I like the way you think.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.534
Okay, but I don't want
to miss the last minute sales.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.370
Well, we can do both, pookie.

31:43.403 --> 31:45.105
Okay, pookie.

31:45.138 --> 31:46.573
But shopping first.

31:49.175 --> 31:50.844
All right, we'll
catch up with you later.

31:50.877 --> 31:51.611
Mm-hm.

31:52.712 --> 31:54.481
Drives me crazy.

31:54.514 --> 31:55.615
What?

31:55.648 --> 31:58.685
Tripp putting
Chanel's needs above his.

31:58.718 --> 32:00.720
Just so typical of him, right?

32:00.754 --> 32:03.523
So kind and unselfish.

32:03.556 --> 32:04.657
Wait.

32:05.825 --> 32:07.460
Are you in love with Tripp?

32:07.494 --> 32:10.897
What no,
no he's my BFF's boyfriend

32:10.930 --> 32:12.899
Look, Allie, it's okay,
no one's judging you.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.634
I--

32:14.668 --> 32:17.504
If I'm being honest, uh...

32:17.537 --> 32:18.638
I'm kind of in the same boat.

32:18.672 --> 32:21.074
Are you in love with trip?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.275
No.

32:23.677 --> 32:26.312
But I'm totally
in love with Chanel.

32:30.684 --> 32:31.851
PAULINA: Denied?

32:31.885 --> 32:33.653
Nobody denies me.

32:33.687 --> 32:35.655
He wouldn't take the money.

32:35.689 --> 32:37.657
You're a disgrace,
get out of my office!

32:37.691 --> 32:38.625
Ay!

32:38.658 --> 32:41.094
I'm sorry, Miss Price,
I tried!

32:41.094 --> 32:43.229
But did you know that some
of these buildings

32:43.263 --> 32:45.632
have been here for over 50 years

32:45.665 --> 32:48.802
and Mr. Cook he made this
impassioned speech about--

32:48.835 --> 32:50.570
Out, I said.

32:52.739 --> 32:54.207
Wait!

32:54.240 --> 32:55.575
Where's my money?

32:57.777 --> 32:59.012
Oh, right.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.049
[thud]

33:05.085 --> 33:06.453
Hm.

33:06.486 --> 33:08.388
Textbook Mary.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.057
Oh, well, if you want
something done right,

33:11.057 --> 33:12.559
do it yourself.

33:13.593 --> 33:16.496
At least find
the right partner in crime.

33:18.832 --> 33:22.369
Hello, this is Paulina Price.

33:22.402 --> 33:23.937
We need to talk.

33:32.712 --> 33:34.547
You cannot be serious.

33:34.581 --> 33:36.383
"Die Hard" can't be the best
Christmas movie ever.

33:36.416 --> 33:37.984
Well, it takes
place on Christmas Eve.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.653
But it's about
a guy killing terrorists.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.355
To save the woman
that he loves.

33:42.389 --> 33:44.424
It's about family
and friendship...

33:44.457 --> 33:46.426
- And bloodshot...
- And bloodshed?

33:46.459 --> 33:47.794
Yes, okay...

33:47.827 --> 33:48.828
Okay, what's a better
Christmas movie?

33:48.862 --> 33:50.363
Oh, I don't know.

33:50.397 --> 33:51.398
"It's a Wonderful Life," maybe?

33:51.431 --> 33:54.801
Oh come on, boring,
so boring.

33:54.834 --> 33:55.935
Basic.

33:55.969 --> 33:57.003
"Home Alone"?

33:57.103 --> 33:58.705
"Home Alone" is--
is just "Die Hard"

33:58.738 --> 34:00.173
for-- for kids.

34:00.206 --> 34:03.043
Okay, "National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation."

34:03.043 --> 34:04.511
Everybody loves the Griswolds.

34:04.544 --> 34:06.212
Griswolds, brilliant.

34:06.246 --> 34:07.447
Absolutely brilliant.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.349
Cousin Eddie,
obviously the best character

34:09.382 --> 34:11.351
"Save the neck
for me, Clark."

34:11.384 --> 34:12.886
[laughing]

34:12.919 --> 34:14.921
What do you--
what are you doing tonight?

34:14.954 --> 34:18.224
Uh. Nothing.

34:18.258 --> 34:19.659
Literally nothing, why?

34:19.693 --> 34:21.594
Do you wanna go to the pub?

34:21.628 --> 34:22.762
There's this cookie
decorating thing.

34:22.796 --> 34:24.864
- Be my partner.
- Yes.

34:24.898 --> 34:26.399
Absolutely, you're on.

34:26.433 --> 34:28.768
I knew I could count on you
to be my bestie.

34:29.836 --> 34:31.104
Yeah.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.075
Actually Gabi, there's--

34:35.108 --> 34:37.677
there's something that I
wanted to talk to you about.

34:37.711 --> 34:39.913
Ah, good.
They didn't close it down yet.

34:39.946 --> 34:41.348
Brady!

34:41.381 --> 34:43.083
Is the suit-- is it ready?

34:43.083 --> 34:45.385
Oh, yeah, just right here.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.386
[chuckles]

34:46.419 --> 34:48.221
Oh, God, it looks great.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.222
I knew I could count on you.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.295
Hot date tonight?

34:56.563 --> 34:58.965
Uh, sadly, no, no.

34:58.998 --> 35:02.435
The woman I'm into
is not into me the same way.

35:02.469 --> 35:05.138
Are you sure, have you--

35:05.171 --> 35:07.040
Who told her how you feel?

35:07.040 --> 35:08.808
No, I don't know.

35:08.842 --> 35:10.410
I mean, I-- I hate rejection.

35:10.443 --> 35:13.046
I'm not used to it, so I'm--

35:13.046 --> 35:15.248
not really great
at expressing my feelings.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.150
I tend to trip over
my words a little bit.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.686
Maybe you can, uh,
write her a letter.

35:21.254 --> 35:22.789
That's--

35:22.822 --> 35:24.257
Actually a great idea.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.158
[zipping]

35:25.191 --> 35:26.259
- I like that.
- Yeah.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.327
Oh, this suit looks great.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.828
How much do I owe you?

35:28.862 --> 35:30.663
Oh, we're-- you know what?
It's nothing.

35:30.697 --> 35:32.665
Gift for Christmas.

35:32.699 --> 35:34.167
- Really.
- NICK: Really?

35:34.200 --> 35:35.869
Yeah, you've been such
a wonderful customer

35:35.902 --> 35:37.871
and the store is gonna
close down anyway.

35:39.339 --> 35:40.740
Well, at least let me--

35:40.774 --> 35:43.443
let me send you a
little something in return.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.245
Can I have your address?

35:45.278 --> 35:47.647
Oh, yeah, kidding me?

35:47.681 --> 35:49.282
Of course you have...

35:49.315 --> 35:50.417
my address.

35:50.450 --> 35:51.718
Thanks, thanks.

35:51.751 --> 35:54.587
Um, suit looks great.

35:54.621 --> 35:55.588
Thank you.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.030
[exhales]

36:05.832 --> 36:07.767
You think
he was talking about me?

36:09.536 --> 36:10.470
What do you mean?

36:10.503 --> 36:12.072
The woman

36:12.105 --> 36:13.940
that he said
he has feelings for,

36:14.040 --> 36:15.675
that he's afraid
to open up to.

36:15.709 --> 36:17.177
He said he might
write her a letter and

36:17.210 --> 36:18.845
then he asked me for my address.

36:18.878 --> 36:21.848
To thank you for the suit.

36:21.881 --> 36:24.651
I don't know, I just, I--

36:24.684 --> 36:27.087
I kind of feel a vibe.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.356
I don't know if it's
the Christmas spirit but...

36:30.423 --> 36:32.359
Kind of feel like all
my dreams are coming true.

36:34.661 --> 36:36.296
[steps receding]

36:36.329 --> 36:37.230
[sighs]

36:38.431 --> 36:40.767
PAULINA:
Yes, well, thank you.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.203
I'm glad we could
come to an understanding.

36:43.236 --> 36:45.071
Oh, yeah, be in touch.

36:45.071 --> 36:47.073
[laughing]

36:47.073 --> 36:49.909
Well, Mary,

36:49.943 --> 36:51.411
I did it.

36:51.444 --> 36:54.647
The city has approved
the construction of Price Town,

36:54.681 --> 36:57.150
But Hottie McHotFace
wouldn't accept the bribe.

36:57.183 --> 36:58.518
[laughing]

36:58.551 --> 36:59.719
Oh, I found a way around that.

36:59.753 --> 37:01.054
It's all happening.

37:01.087 --> 37:02.222
Nothing could stop me now.

37:02.255 --> 37:03.623
Are you sure about this, boss?

37:03.656 --> 37:05.225
Those places, they mean
a lot to this town.

37:05.258 --> 37:07.127
This calls for a celebration

37:07.160 --> 37:09.462
of epic proportions,
steak, lobster, champagne.

37:09.496 --> 37:11.398
Well, that does
sound divine.

37:11.431 --> 37:13.299
Shall I make a reservation
at the Penthouse Grill?

37:13.333 --> 37:14.668
Yeah, for one,

37:14.701 --> 37:16.036
since it was a little old me

37:16.069 --> 37:18.405
who sealed the deal and you,
you did diddly squat.

37:18.438 --> 37:19.873
So you know what?
You get to stay here

37:19.906 --> 37:21.207
and clean up my office.

37:22.909 --> 37:25.278
And don't forget
to email one last reminder

37:25.311 --> 37:26.780
about the evictions.

37:26.813 --> 37:28.348
Ta-ta, Mary.

37:28.381 --> 37:29.649
It's Leo.

37:39.559 --> 37:41.561
It was so good of you
to think of this.

37:41.594 --> 37:44.330
Oh, wow, I may not
like Christmas but

37:44.364 --> 37:46.766
I do enjoy spending time
with my family and friends

37:46.800 --> 37:49.069
and it's nice to be able
to lift their spirits,

37:49.069 --> 37:51.271
especially given
the circumstances

37:51.304 --> 37:53.940
that we're about
to lose everything.

37:55.075 --> 37:57.444
Snazzy shirt I bought him, huh?

37:57.477 --> 37:59.079
Looks a little tight.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.614
It's fine, as long
as I don't exhale.

38:03.049 --> 38:06.653
I love the way it shows off
your muscles, pookie.

38:06.686 --> 38:07.921
Well, hey, if
he doesn't want it.

38:08.021 --> 38:10.056
Looks like it might
fit me, so...

38:10.090 --> 38:13.460
See, now Johnny here
has excellent taste.

38:18.031 --> 38:21.668
I feel like you're more
of a flannel kind of guy,

38:21.701 --> 38:23.036
maybe a size too big.

38:23.036 --> 38:24.738
I do enjoy breathing.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.876
[indistinct chatter]

38:31.644 --> 38:34.147
Oh, look who's here!

38:34.180 --> 38:37.250
Oh, mom, we have a real life
princess here tonight.

38:37.283 --> 38:39.619
We just got back from seeing
The Nutcracker, didn't we?

38:39.652 --> 38:41.087
Did you like it?

38:41.121 --> 38:42.188
Boring.

38:42.222 --> 38:43.490
Nobody even talks.

38:43.523 --> 38:45.058
- [laughing]
- Oh, dear.

38:45.058 --> 38:47.260
Nicole stayed behind
for the official gala.

38:47.293 --> 38:49.629
I thought this
might be more Sydney's speed.

38:50.697 --> 38:52.499
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, yeah, good, you can--

38:52.532 --> 38:53.633
You can be a team.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.535
I want Sami on our team.

38:55.568 --> 38:56.670
It's pairs of two, honey.

38:56.703 --> 38:59.239
Oh, wait, wait,
I'm judging.

38:59.272 --> 39:01.374
I think I can make an exception.

39:01.408 --> 39:02.809
- SAMI: Yay!
- Yay!

39:02.842 --> 39:04.010
[laughing]
Why don't--

39:04.010 --> 39:06.012
Why don't you find a place?

39:06.012 --> 39:07.747
We're about to get started.

39:07.781 --> 39:10.684
Yeah, uh, all right,
why don't you go there?

39:10.717 --> 39:12.018
I'll meet you in a minute.

39:12.052 --> 39:13.653
Take your coat off.

39:21.494 --> 39:23.596
[inaudible]

39:30.904 --> 39:31.571
Something wrong?

39:31.604 --> 39:33.106
Oh, no.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.142
No, I-- I was just...

39:37.510 --> 39:39.579
hoping John might
be coming by.

39:45.385 --> 39:47.187
Now, are you sure

39:47.220 --> 39:49.923
that you don't want to go
to Marlena's party?

39:49.956 --> 39:53.126
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,
I'm just really--

39:53.159 --> 39:55.095
I'm just really
not in the mood tonight.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.131
It's all right.

39:58.164 --> 40:01.434
Hey, maybe we can
just snuggle up in bed,

40:01.468 --> 40:03.303
watch a holiday movie,

40:03.336 --> 40:06.373
Maybe the one with
Hugh Grant when he plays

40:06.406 --> 40:08.975
the Prime Minister and
a guy from the zombie show.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.311
I just love it when
he comes to the door holding

40:11.344 --> 40:12.979
those big signs.

40:13.013 --> 40:14.681
Really?

40:14.714 --> 40:17.250
Don't you think
it's just a little sappy and...

40:17.283 --> 40:18.585
kind of stalkery.

40:18.618 --> 40:21.554
No, it is romantic
and it's sweet.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.223
Oh, come on, give it another
chance,

40:23.256 --> 40:24.924
I guarantee...

40:24.958 --> 40:27.160
it will melt your heart.

40:37.470 --> 40:38.872
[sighs]

40:49.215 --> 40:50.216
[clicks tongue]

40:50.250 --> 40:51.718
This is interesting.

40:54.287 --> 40:55.622
[paper rustling]

40:57.657 --> 40:58.658
Yeah.

41:04.731 --> 41:05.799
Yeah.

41:08.435 --> 41:10.070
[laughing]

41:10.070 --> 41:11.738
- I think this border--
- There, there.

41:11.771 --> 41:12.772
Yeah, what do you think?

41:13.773 --> 41:15.141
[indistinct chatter]

41:18.211 --> 41:19.312
Is it too much?

41:19.346 --> 41:20.647
[sighs]
Damn it.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.715
What?

41:23.216 --> 41:25.151
- What's wrong?
- I just--

41:25.185 --> 41:27.220
I lost another bid
for the VR goggles

41:27.253 --> 41:28.555
that Ari wants
for Christmas.

41:28.588 --> 41:30.256
What am I gonna do?
They're sold out everywhere.

41:30.290 --> 41:32.826
- Really? Hmm.
- Yeah.

41:32.859 --> 41:34.994
Well, that might be because

41:35.095 --> 41:36.896
I bought the last pair?

41:36.930 --> 41:38.998
Wait, you bought them?
Why?

41:39.099 --> 41:40.734
For you to give to Ari.

41:40.767 --> 41:41.968
I mean, I heard you
talking about

41:42.002 --> 41:44.170
how hard it was
to find them and...

41:45.772 --> 41:47.507
And you did that for me?

41:47.540 --> 41:49.442
Of course I did.

41:49.476 --> 41:51.378
Gabi, I'd--

41:51.411 --> 41:53.279
I'd do anything for...

41:53.313 --> 41:55.115
Um, uh...

41:56.416 --> 41:58.752
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:58.785 --> 42:00.653
children of all ages,

42:00.687 --> 42:03.056
I have made my decision

42:03.056 --> 42:06.960
but first let me say that you
are all winners in my book.

42:07.060 --> 42:08.361
[laughing]

42:08.395 --> 42:12.198
I should say on these
very trying times,

42:12.232 --> 42:14.467
you brought Christmas cheer.

42:14.501 --> 42:16.202
And that fills us all with joy.

42:18.071 --> 42:20.106
- Hear, hear!
- [cheering]

42:20.140 --> 42:22.809
Now, there can
only be one champion.

42:24.477 --> 42:26.446
So the winners of this year's

42:26.479 --> 42:30.083
Brady Pub Christmas
Cookie Decorating...

42:31.217 --> 42:33.086
is...

42:33.119 --> 42:34.120
Nick and Gabi!

42:34.154 --> 42:35.522
Ooh!
Nick, we won!

42:35.555 --> 42:36.756
[overlapping chatter]

42:36.790 --> 42:37.757
[laughing]

42:37.791 --> 42:40.627
- We did it.
- We sure did.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.295
And you make quite a team.

42:43.663 --> 42:44.698
[laughing]

42:47.300 --> 42:48.201
[sighs]

42:48.234 --> 42:49.903
Yeah, yeah.

42:49.936 --> 42:51.438
I'll give it to him.

42:51.471 --> 42:53.106
Hey, what kind
of devilish judge

42:53.106 --> 42:54.874
doesn't pick
her own grandkids?

42:54.908 --> 42:57.110
Well, I calls them
like I sees them.

42:58.345 --> 43:00.780
In fact,

43:00.814 --> 43:04.551
Allie's gingerbread man
looks a lot like Tripp's.

43:04.584 --> 43:08.088
And yours looks
a lot like Chanel's.

43:09.189 --> 43:10.490
Hm.

43:10.523 --> 43:13.593
Maybe y'all should
have switched partners, hm?

43:33.747 --> 43:36.282
Let me help you with this,
you got a little--

43:36.316 --> 43:38.485
- [laughing]
- [door closes]

43:38.518 --> 43:40.120
[Nicole clears her throat]

43:40.153 --> 43:41.721
Look, Mommy,
we made a gingerbread man.

43:41.755 --> 43:43.089
Oh, wow.

43:43.089 --> 43:46.426
Oh, and got frosting
all over your new dress.

43:47.727 --> 43:48.461
I'm sorry.

43:48.495 --> 43:49.329
EJ: It's okay, honey.

43:49.362 --> 43:50.430
It'll come out in the wash.

43:50.463 --> 43:53.233
That is her answer
for everything.

43:53.266 --> 43:54.934
Can we talk about this
in private, please?

43:58.538 --> 44:00.106
Be right back, Syd.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.541
Daddy is in trouble, ugh.

44:01.574 --> 44:02.776
[chuckles]

44:02.809 --> 44:03.910
You know what?

44:03.943 --> 44:05.345
I think I can get it out.

44:05.378 --> 44:07.681
Let me just see if
I can fix this real quick.

44:07.714 --> 44:08.715
Yeah, look, see?

44:08.748 --> 44:10.083
Yeah, ha! Perfect.

44:10.116 --> 44:12.285
Perfect.

44:12.318 --> 44:16.056
Sami, can I tell you a secret?

44:16.056 --> 44:17.424
Of course you can.

44:19.059 --> 44:20.860
I wish you were my mommy.

44:22.228 --> 44:23.730
Oh...

44:29.069 --> 44:31.171
JOHN: Kristen,
what are you doing in there?

44:31.204 --> 44:33.073
My favorite scene
is coming up.

44:33.073 --> 44:34.374
Be right there!

44:34.407 --> 44:35.542
God, I'm gonna need this

44:35.575 --> 44:37.310
to get through the rest
of that movie.

44:37.344 --> 44:38.745
[knocking on door]

44:46.953 --> 44:47.921
[mouthing]
Shh.

44:55.562 --> 44:57.630
What the world?

44:57.664 --> 44:59.232
JOHN: Who's at the door?

45:00.467 --> 45:01.601
SAY IT'S CAROLERS

45:01.634 --> 45:02.635
It's carolers!

45:08.742 --> 45:13.380
* O holy night, the stars
are brightly shining *

45:13.413 --> 45:16.316
I'M SHOPPING AROUND
FOR A GIRLFRIEND

45:16.349 --> 45:19.853
* It is the night
of out dear Savior's birth *

45:19.886 --> 45:23.123
HERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS

45:23.156 --> 45:26.393
* Long lay the world *

45:26.426 --> 45:30.897
* In sin
and error pining *

45:30.930 --> 45:33.333
* 'Til He appeared and
the spirit felt its worth *

45:33.366 --> 45:35.802
I'D RATHER BE WITH YOU

45:37.537 --> 45:40.707
* A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices *

45:40.740 --> 45:42.442
BUT TO YOU,
I'M JUST A HARD

45:44.711 --> 45:47.580
* For yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn *

45:47.614 --> 45:49.416
BODY (WHICH, FINE,
I'M OBVIOUSLY HOT)

45:52.285 --> 45:55.188
* Fall on your knees *

45:55.221 --> 45:57.223
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS

45:58.591 --> 46:03.063
* O hear the angel voices *

46:03.096 --> 46:06.366
I LOVE YOU, KRISTEN

46:06.399 --> 46:09.903
* O night *

46:09.936 --> 46:13.039
* Divine *

46:13.039 --> 46:16.443
PERHAPS ONE DAY
YOU'LL LOVE ME BACK?

46:16.476 --> 46:20.313
* When Christ was born *

46:20.347 --> 46:21.414
* O night... *

46:21.448 --> 46:23.049
I'm sorry,

46:23.049 --> 46:24.217
just can't.

46:24.250 --> 46:27.721
* Divine *

46:27.754 --> 46:30.924
* O night *

46:30.957 --> 46:33.293
* O night divine *

46:33.326 --> 46:35.762
YOU MADE ME
THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE!

46:35.795 --> 46:40.800
* [vocalizing] *

46:40.834 --> 46:42.869
I UNDERSTAND

46:42.902 --> 46:47.440
* [vocalizing] *

46:47.474 --> 46:49.943
GOODBYE

46:49.976 --> 46:57.083
* Fall on your knees *

46:57.117 --> 47:00.153
* Oh, hear the angel voices *

47:00.186 --> 47:04.557
[sighs]

47:04.591 --> 47:08.094
* O night *

47:08.128 --> 47:11.031
* Divine *

47:11.064 --> 47:14.567
* O night *

47:14.601 --> 47:18.505
* When Christ was born *

47:18.538 --> 47:22.709
* O night *

47:22.742 --> 47:25.912
* Divine *

47:25.945 --> 47:29.249
* O night *

47:29.282 --> 47:33.787
* O night divine *

47:37.624 --> 47:39.492
[yawning]

47:41.895 --> 47:43.263
[sighs]

47:43.296 --> 47:44.731
Wow.

47:44.764 --> 47:46.066
That was fun,
wasn't it?

47:48.101 --> 47:49.436
I think I'm gonna go upstairs

47:49.469 --> 47:51.371
and wash my face,
put on some flannels

47:51.404 --> 47:53.940
and watch my favorite
Christmas movie.

47:53.973 --> 47:57.077
The-- the one with Hugh Grant.

47:57.077 --> 47:58.912
Oh, my God.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.282
What is it?

48:02.315 --> 48:03.450
Mom.

48:04.851 --> 48:08.254
I think I have a way that I can
save the business after all.

48:15.362 --> 48:19.032
* *

48:28.441 --> 48:31.311
How did they find out
about that damn loophole?

48:31.344 --> 48:32.746
No idea, boss.

48:32.779 --> 48:33.847
Explain it to me again.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.315
[grunts]

48:35.348 --> 48:39.052
Apparently,
a Salem law from 1965

48:39.052 --> 48:42.455
states that any small
business owner

48:42.489 --> 48:44.758
operating in
an historic district

48:44.791 --> 48:46.493
for at least a year

48:46.526 --> 48:47.927
has the right to buy out
their lease.

48:49.129 --> 48:50.330
So that's it?

48:50.363 --> 48:51.731
Price Town is dead
in the water?

48:51.765 --> 48:54.868
Oh, hell, no, hell, no, Mary,

48:54.901 --> 48:57.203
they only have until
midnight tonight

48:57.237 --> 48:58.471
to raise the money

48:58.505 --> 49:00.006
and those deadbeats
over there

49:00.006 --> 49:01.374
they're barely
making ends meet.

49:01.408 --> 49:05.478
So if they can't
scrounge up the cash,

49:05.512 --> 49:07.247
it's eviction time in Salem.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.214
[laughing]

49:08.248 --> 49:09.816
Full speed ahead!

49:09.849 --> 49:12.185
[chuckling]

49:12.218 --> 49:13.820
Oh, a Christmas Eve deadline.

49:13.853 --> 49:15.121
Just like your script.

49:15.155 --> 49:16.423
- Very meta.
- Yeah.

49:16.456 --> 49:17.791
Gotta push on the climax,

49:17.824 --> 49:19.526
Our characters
are running out of time.

49:19.559 --> 49:20.727
Ooh, and so are we.

49:22.195 --> 49:24.030
SAMI: [clears throat]
Okay, everybody,

49:24.030 --> 49:25.899
thank you all for coming.

49:25.932 --> 49:28.335
I know you'd rather
spend Christmas Eve

49:28.368 --> 49:31.037
with your families but, um...

49:31.037 --> 49:33.306
but we are running out of
time to save our businesses.

49:34.908 --> 49:38.044
John, have you been
able to pull together enough

49:38.078 --> 49:39.913
money to buy our leases?

49:39.946 --> 49:41.614
Even pulling our resources

49:41.648 --> 49:43.516
we're coming up short.

49:43.550 --> 49:44.951
So pooling was a mistake.

49:45.051 --> 49:45.919
But maybe we can still save

49:45.952 --> 49:47.220
a couple
of the businesses, right?

49:47.253 --> 49:48.688
MARLENA: No, no.

49:48.722 --> 49:51.057
We have to stick together.

49:51.057 --> 49:53.059
It's all or nothing.

49:53.059 --> 49:54.728
I have to agree with Marlena.

49:56.296 --> 49:58.932
Couldn't you ask your mom to
give us an extension?

49:58.965 --> 50:00.934
I can try.

50:00.967 --> 50:02.602
But I doubt
she'll change her mind.

50:02.635 --> 50:04.137
GABI: Damn it, you guys,
I mean,

50:04.170 --> 50:06.573
there must be a way to get
that money by midnight, we--

50:06.606 --> 50:07.774
we can't just give up.

50:07.807 --> 50:08.675
SAMI: You're right.

50:08.708 --> 50:10.543
You are right, Gabi, we can't.

50:11.678 --> 50:12.912
So...

50:14.614 --> 50:15.949
I have an idea.

50:21.521 --> 50:23.590
CHRISTMAS EVE
TALENT SHOW FUNDRAISER

50:27.394 --> 50:29.162
So, what do you think?

50:29.195 --> 50:30.397
How's it look?

50:30.430 --> 50:31.998
Perfect.

50:32.032 --> 50:33.700
You know, for someone
who's not a fan of Christmas,

50:33.733 --> 50:35.068
you've certainly
gotten into the spirit.

50:35.101 --> 50:36.136
[laughing]

50:36.169 --> 50:37.570
I know, right?

50:37.604 --> 50:38.772
I don't know
what's come over me.

50:38.805 --> 50:40.206
[chuckles]

50:40.240 --> 50:42.208
So, do you think
this fundraiser

50:42.242 --> 50:43.510
will get you over the line?

50:43.543 --> 50:46.746
I hope so, that's our
last best shot.

50:46.780 --> 50:49.115
I talked to WXIR and
they're going to broadcast

50:49.149 --> 50:51.317
the whole thing, so that'll
bring a lot more eyeballs too.

50:51.351 --> 50:53.119
- That's great!
- Yeah.

50:53.153 --> 50:54.854
And I'll donate
as much as I can.

50:54.888 --> 50:56.690
Oh, no, EJ.
I'm not asking that.

50:56.723 --> 50:58.858
No, no, no, it's my pleasure,

50:58.892 --> 51:01.528
but unfortunately

51:01.561 --> 51:05.165
all of DiMera's assets
are now temporarily frozen.

51:05.198 --> 51:06.599
What?

51:06.633 --> 51:08.234
What happened this time?

51:08.268 --> 51:09.769
The SCC is after us again.

51:09.803 --> 51:10.904
I'm sure it will blow over,

51:10.937 --> 51:13.373
but not in time to donate
to your cause.

51:13.406 --> 51:14.974
I see.

51:15.075 --> 51:16.810
But I'm willing to do

51:16.843 --> 51:18.712
whatever I can to--
to help out.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.781
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

51:21.815 --> 51:25.852
Well, I'm really glad
that you say that because, um...

51:25.885 --> 51:27.287
Do have a costume for you.

51:27.320 --> 51:29.122
Uh-- Costume?

51:29.155 --> 51:30.423
[laughing]

51:38.598 --> 51:41.101
I was told to pick up
my costume for the show.

51:43.336 --> 51:46.106
We have to stop
meeting like this.

51:46.106 --> 51:48.308
- What?
- Because of the suit and now--

51:48.341 --> 51:50.243
- Here it is.
- Okay.

51:50.276 --> 51:51.678
Uhm, you know?

51:51.711 --> 51:53.513
I thought about what you said.

51:53.546 --> 51:55.482
About, um,
expressing my feelings

51:55.515 --> 51:56.950
for the woman that I love.

51:56.983 --> 51:58.284
Yes.

51:58.318 --> 52:00.820
BRADY: And I decided
to take your advice.

52:01.888 --> 52:03.089
And?

52:03.123 --> 52:04.891
And she turned me down.

52:06.393 --> 52:07.560
Flat.

52:09.229 --> 52:11.965
Oh, I see, I'm so sorry.

52:12.065 --> 52:13.967
Thank you.

52:14.067 --> 52:16.803
I guess it's time for me
to just, you know, move on.

52:18.271 --> 52:19.639
Yeah, but then you know, maybe

52:19.673 --> 52:21.808
you and I
can hang out sometime.

52:23.476 --> 52:24.644
BRADY: Oh, um...

52:26.146 --> 52:28.882
Thanks, I'm--
I'm flattered, Gabi, but...

52:28.915 --> 52:31.951
I really think we should keep
our relationship professional.

52:31.985 --> 52:35.388
I mean we work for
rival companies, right?

52:35.422 --> 52:37.157
Yeah, right, yeah, of course.

52:37.190 --> 52:38.825
But thank you, thank you.

52:38.858 --> 52:40.226
Yeah.

52:48.768 --> 52:49.969
Oh, my God.

52:50.003 --> 52:51.471
I'm such an idiot.

52:51.504 --> 52:52.372
Ugh!

52:54.507 --> 52:56.343
No.

52:56.376 --> 52:57.811
Gabi, you're wrong.

52:57.844 --> 53:00.213
Brady Black is the idiot.

53:01.548 --> 53:03.183
He doesn't deserve you.

53:09.756 --> 53:10.890
[sighs]

53:10.924 --> 53:12.459
[guitar music playing]

53:12.492 --> 53:13.760
[applause]

53:13.793 --> 53:15.261
[laughing]

53:15.295 --> 53:16.663
Wow.

53:16.696 --> 53:19.065
Everybody,
this is Allie and Chanel.

53:19.065 --> 53:21.534
Co-owners of Sweet Bits.

53:21.568 --> 53:23.436
Wow, that was fantastic.

53:24.971 --> 53:27.307
What an interesting choice
to cover the Indigo Girls.

53:28.775 --> 53:30.977
Well, I want to thank
all of you so much.

53:31.077 --> 53:33.913
All of you out there
for being so generous.

53:33.947 --> 53:35.415
[applause]

53:35.448 --> 53:37.550
[chiming]
GOAL

53:37.584 --> 53:39.986
But, as you can see, we haven't
reached our goal yet,

53:40.086 --> 53:42.422
so, please keep
those donations coming.

53:42.455 --> 53:44.691
Oh, give it up, honey!

53:44.724 --> 53:46.459
It's almost midnight

53:46.493 --> 53:48.661
and that meter is about
as dead as this mink.

53:48.695 --> 53:51.231
You are never gonna stop
Price Town from happening.

53:51.264 --> 53:53.400
Oh, the show isn't over yet.

53:53.433 --> 53:54.668
PAULINA: I beg your pardon?

53:55.735 --> 53:56.803
There's still one more act.

53:56.836 --> 53:59.005
How do you know that?

53:59.105 --> 54:00.040
Because I booked it.

54:00.040 --> 54:01.241
You did what?

54:02.342 --> 54:03.943
Who do you think
tipped everyone off

54:04.044 --> 54:06.146
about the loophole in the law?

54:06.179 --> 54:09.249
You? How could you stab
me in the back, Mary?

54:09.282 --> 54:11.685
After everything I've done
for you, Mary!

54:11.718 --> 54:13.653
For the last time
my name is--

54:13.687 --> 54:14.854
You know what?

54:14.888 --> 54:17.357
Let's go with Mary,
but with an E and two Rs

54:17.390 --> 54:19.459
as in Merry Christmas.

54:21.261 --> 54:22.328
If you don't mind...

54:22.362 --> 54:23.329
- I don't mind at all.
- Thank you.

54:23.363 --> 54:26.232
Ladies, gentlemen...

54:26.266 --> 54:29.069
or however you identify,

54:29.102 --> 54:30.337
I would like to present

54:30.370 --> 54:31.738
our grand finale,

54:31.771 --> 54:34.607
the incomparable
We Three Queens.

54:34.641 --> 54:36.876
[cheering and applause]

54:38.678 --> 54:40.914
Please welcome to the stage

54:40.947 --> 54:43.083
Miss Sunny Delight.

54:44.117 --> 54:45.352
[cheering and applause]

54:45.385 --> 54:46.486
Ow!

54:48.855 --> 54:50.423

Wilhelmina Shakespeare!

54:53.660 --> 54:55.161
[applause]

54:55.195 --> 54:57.497
Oh, okay, okay,
nice- nice try.

54:57.530 --> 54:58.264
Yeah.

54:58.298 --> 54:59.299
What?

54:59.332 --> 55:00.800
We need a grand finale.

55:00.834 --> 55:02.869
That's not what I meant
and you know it.

55:04.571 --> 55:05.839
Fine.

55:07.607 --> 55:09.042
Here you go.

55:13.079 --> 55:16.383
Amanda Bottom!

55:16.416 --> 55:17.917
[cheering and applause]

55:20.053 --> 55:21.321
[laughing]

55:22.655 --> 55:26.493
And last
but certainly not least,

55:26.526 --> 55:28.628
the belle of the ball

55:28.661 --> 55:30.196
with the big blue eyes

55:30.230 --> 55:33.233
Miss Bullinda Chinashop.

55:33.266 --> 55:35.168
[cheering and applause]

55:40.440 --> 55:42.242
Take it away.

57:04.257 --> 57:05.925
[cheering and applause]

57:10.563 --> 57:13.466
Ha, close, but no cigar.

57:18.104 --> 57:20.540
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

57:20.573 --> 57:22.275
No, we are not finished yet,

57:22.308 --> 57:24.144
So, you got a gander
at us girls

57:24.177 --> 57:26.746
but now it's time for you
to check out the boys,

57:26.780 --> 57:28.815
ladies and gentlemen,

57:28.848 --> 57:32.419
give it up for
Salem's Sexy Santa.

57:32.452 --> 57:34.387
[cheering and applause]

57:36.756 --> 57:41.628
* We Three Kings
of Orient are *

57:41.661 --> 57:45.532

* I like it *
* Join the party *

58:50.697 --> 58:52.499
You know, you should know
that I always wondered

58:52.532 --> 58:54.401
why aren't the two
of you a couple.

58:54.434 --> 58:56.903
What? No, Nick is my
friend, I don't--

58:56.936 --> 58:57.904
I don't see him like that.

58:57.937 --> 58:59.072
[laughing]

* Join the party *

Nick.

[inaudible]

59:09.749 --> 59:11.117
I can't believe
that perfect guy

59:11.151 --> 59:13.086
has been under
my nose the whole time.

59:14.821 --> 59:16.222
* [vocalizing] *

59:17.657 --> 59:19.626
CHANEL: Horton,
I-- I was thinking

59:19.659 --> 59:22.362
that maybe Johnny and me...

59:22.395 --> 59:24.097
I know.

59:24.130 --> 59:25.265
* Come on *

59:25.298 --> 59:27.200
* [vocalizing]
Come on *

59:27.233 --> 59:30.036
* Come on, you faithful *

* Oh, come on,
you faithful *

* Join the party *

59:35.208 --> 59:37.177

1:00:11.444 --> 1:00:12.212
JOHN: Great job!

1:00:12.245 --> 1:00:14.114
SAMI: We did it!

1:00:14.147 --> 1:00:16.349
Mom, we got enough to save
the Horton Town Square

1:00:16.383 --> 1:00:18.418
and the Brady Pub is saved!

1:00:18.451 --> 1:00:19.185
Oh!

1:00:21.321 --> 1:00:23.056
Thank you,
thank you so much!

1:00:28.128 --> 1:00:29.496
What the--?

1:00:46.079 --> 1:00:48.248
I can't believe
she pulled this off.

1:00:48.281 --> 1:00:50.183
Oh, you've got to be
so proud of your daughter.

1:00:50.216 --> 1:00:52.152
I am, I am, I am.

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.890
Don't you-- don't you want
to go find Kristen?

1:00:56.923 --> 1:00:58.224
I'm not sure where she is,

1:00:58.258 --> 1:00:59.859
but you'd want to tell her
the good news, won't you?

1:00:59.893 --> 1:01:02.295
Well, to be honest,

1:01:02.328 --> 1:01:04.597
I'm beginning to wonder
if she even cares.

1:01:06.766 --> 1:01:09.502
* O holy night *

1:01:09.869 --> 1:01:14.307
* The stars are
brightly shining *

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:15.508
* It is the night
of our dear Savior's birth *

1:01:15.542 --> 1:01:18.812
I LOVE YOU, KRISTEN

1:01:21.348 --> 1:01:23.650
John was right.

1:01:23.683 --> 1:01:25.251
This is the best part.

1:01:25.285 --> 1:01:28.588
* Sin and error pining *

1:01:28.621 --> 1:01:30.090
[indistinct chattering]

1:01:32.258 --> 1:01:35.095
Oh, my God.

1:01:35.095 --> 1:01:36.563
You were amazing.

1:01:42.836 --> 1:01:44.604
[chuckling]

1:01:45.839 --> 1:01:47.874
Gabi.

1:01:47.907 --> 1:01:49.275
Is this real?

1:01:50.877 --> 1:01:53.480
I've been pining for
the wrong Santa the entire time.

1:01:53.513 --> 1:01:55.248
I don't know
what I've been thinking.

1:01:59.953 --> 1:02:00.820
EJ: You did it, Samantha.

1:02:00.854 --> 1:02:01.955
This is all because of you.

1:02:02.055 --> 1:02:03.823
Well, I had a lot of help

1:02:03.857 --> 1:02:05.725
and I'm just so grateful.

1:02:05.759 --> 1:02:08.895
I mean, you know, to everyone.

1:02:08.928 --> 1:02:11.865
Oh, I should give you
back your pants.

1:02:11.898 --> 1:02:12.799
[laughing]
Thank you.

1:02:12.832 --> 1:02:15.402
And you should be happy too,

1:02:15.435 --> 1:02:17.070
because you deserve it.

1:02:17.070 --> 1:02:18.304
Thank you, EJ.

1:02:18.338 --> 1:02:19.606
Thank you so much.

1:02:19.639 --> 1:02:21.207
You're welcome.

1:02:32.452 --> 1:02:35.722
You know, I don't think this
night could be any more perfect.

1:02:38.858 --> 1:02:41.094
John, it's snowing.

1:02:41.094 --> 1:02:42.595
- What?
- [gasps]

1:02:51.905 --> 1:02:54.708
Doesn't this place have a roof?

1:02:56.810 --> 1:02:59.145
It's a Christmas miracle.

1:03:22.569 --> 1:03:24.270
Well, Dad, we did it.

1:03:24.304 --> 1:03:26.406
I wired the money
just in time.

1:03:26.439 --> 1:03:28.308
The Brady Pub is here to stay.

1:03:29.709 --> 1:03:31.778
But you know that, don't you?

1:03:31.811 --> 1:03:33.213
Because you were here

1:03:33.246 --> 1:03:35.215
looking out for me
the whole time, weren't you?

1:03:35.248 --> 1:03:36.616
[door opens]

1:03:38.918 --> 1:03:41.421
Sami Brady, you and I are going
to get something straight.

1:03:41.454 --> 1:03:42.989
What now, Nicole?

1:03:43.089 --> 1:03:45.358
I saw you uglying
my husband earlier.

1:03:45.392 --> 1:03:46.693
Uglying, really?

1:03:46.726 --> 1:03:49.329
Yes and you're gonna
stay away from him.

1:03:49.362 --> 1:03:50.597
And while you're at it,

1:03:50.630 --> 1:03:52.799
stay away from my daughter, too.
[door slams]

1:03:52.832 --> 1:03:54.200
EJ: Except she isn't
your daughter, is she, Nicole?

1:03:55.168 --> 1:03:56.302
What?

1:03:56.336 --> 1:03:57.804
What are you
talking about?

1:03:57.837 --> 1:03:59.806
I just had a talk
with Rafe Hernandez.

1:03:59.839 --> 1:04:01.941
The man is a self-righteous
Neanderthal

1:04:02.042 --> 1:04:03.543
but he uncovered
a great injustice.

1:04:05.278 --> 1:04:06.179
What are you saying?

1:04:06.212 --> 1:04:07.580
Samantha.

1:04:08.948 --> 1:04:11.084
Our child didn't die
all those years back.

1:04:13.186 --> 1:04:14.888
Nicole switched the babies.

1:04:14.921 --> 1:04:16.523
What?

1:04:16.556 --> 1:04:18.792
Sydney is your daughter,

1:04:18.825 --> 1:04:20.894
not Nicole's.

1:04:20.927 --> 1:04:22.162
My daughter.

1:04:22.195 --> 1:04:24.731
No, no, that is not true.

1:04:24.764 --> 1:04:26.633
Sydney is my daughter.

1:04:28.902 --> 1:04:30.370
She's my daughter.

1:04:32.072 --> 1:04:33.239
No.

1:04:33.273 --> 1:04:34.441
Oh!

1:04:37.577 --> 1:04:39.412
Say it.

1:04:39.446 --> 1:04:41.815
Sydney...

1:04:41.848 --> 1:04:44.718
is EJ's and my daughter,

1:04:44.751 --> 1:04:46.086
isn't she?

1:04:48.421 --> 1:04:49.356
No.

1:04:49.389 --> 1:04:50.690
Oh!

1:04:50.724 --> 1:04:51.958
Say it, Nicole!

1:04:53.193 --> 1:04:55.362
"She's Sami's child."

1:04:55.395 --> 1:04:57.163
Sydney is mine

1:04:57.197 --> 1:05:00.033
and I'm gonna
make you say it.

1:05:06.106 --> 1:05:07.374
Sydney...

1:05:09.075 --> 1:05:10.043
[sniffles]

1:05:10.043 --> 1:05:11.778
Sydney is yours.

1:05:15.482 --> 1:05:16.649
[gasps]

1:05:18.585 --> 1:05:20.553
[breathing heavily]

1:05:22.555 --> 1:05:23.923
Horton's winding down?

1:05:23.957 --> 1:05:25.425
Is it?

1:05:25.458 --> 1:05:26.960
I barely noticed.

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:28.361
What do you want to do now?

1:05:29.329 --> 1:05:30.663
We could, uh...

1:05:31.664 --> 1:05:33.333
Go back to my place

1:05:33.366 --> 1:05:36.369
and watch the Griswolds

1:05:36.403 --> 1:05:38.405
or we could
watch Bruce Willis

1:05:38.438 --> 1:05:40.407
kill a bunch of terrorists
in his bare feet.

1:05:42.642 --> 1:05:46.446
I thought "Die Hard"
wasn't Christmas movie.

1:05:46.479 --> 1:05:48.081
You know, I'm starting
to see things

1:05:48.081 --> 1:05:49.482
in a whole new light.

1:05:54.087 --> 1:05:57.157
So, this is...

1:05:57.190 --> 1:05:58.792
Awkward?

1:05:58.825 --> 1:06:00.226
It doesn't have to be.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:01.828
Yeah, she's right, you know?

1:06:01.861 --> 1:06:04.030
I-- I think we'll
all be happier this way.

1:06:04.064 --> 1:06:05.465
TRIPP: I mean, we're finally
matched with the person

1:06:05.498 --> 1:06:07.734
we're meant to be with,
don't you think?

1:06:10.070 --> 1:06:11.204
Uh-huh.

1:06:12.272 --> 1:06:13.340
Right, Dupree?

1:06:14.874 --> 1:06:16.343
Yeah, Horton.

1:06:16.376 --> 1:06:17.510
Totally.

1:06:18.878 --> 1:06:21.081
LEO: Hello, Historical
Society guy.

1:06:24.250 --> 1:06:27.053
Mr. Stark, you know you did
a wonderful thing tonight.

1:06:27.053 --> 1:06:29.556
I was pleasantly surprised
to see you in the show.

1:06:29.589 --> 1:06:31.191
Really, why?

1:06:31.224 --> 1:06:32.826
Paulina convinced
somebody from the City

1:06:32.859 --> 1:06:34.627
to approve her plans,
I was worried it was you.

1:06:34.661 --> 1:06:36.062
No, not me.

1:06:36.062 --> 1:06:37.364
Mm.

1:06:37.397 --> 1:06:38.865
I wonder who helped her, then.

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:43.403
If that wasn't so
humiliating,

1:06:43.436 --> 1:06:45.271
my plans foiled

1:06:45.305 --> 1:06:48.441
by a drag show,
of all things.

1:06:48.475 --> 1:06:50.677
WOMAN: I gave it my best shot.

1:06:50.710 --> 1:06:52.245
I called in all my favors

1:06:52.278 --> 1:06:53.980
to get that variance for you.

1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:56.082
Too bad it was all for nothing.

1:06:56.116 --> 1:06:59.519
Well, at least you don't have
to keep running that stupid inn.

1:06:59.552 --> 1:07:01.021
Not to mention,
I think I've blown

1:07:01.021 --> 1:07:03.723
my one chance
to real happiness.

1:07:06.126 --> 1:07:08.461
Seems I had
you pegged all wrong.

1:07:08.495 --> 1:07:10.430
You and the rest
of the human race.

1:07:10.463 --> 1:07:12.932
Seriously, you should
be proud of yourself.

1:07:13.033 --> 1:07:14.401
You helped to save the town.

1:07:14.434 --> 1:07:16.169
I did, didn't I?

1:07:16.202 --> 1:07:18.738
May I ask, what made you
change your tune?

1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:23.643
Honestly, it was that
passionate speech you gave me

1:07:23.677 --> 1:07:27.414
about tradition and some things
being more important than money.

1:07:27.447 --> 1:07:29.082
I didn't think
you were listening.

1:07:29.115 --> 1:07:30.517
Not listening?

1:07:30.550 --> 1:07:33.720
Honey, I'm gonna needlepoint
that speech into a pillow.

1:07:33.753 --> 1:07:36.056
[laughing]
Well, I'm flattered.

1:07:37.090 --> 1:07:38.224
Somehow you got through to me

1:07:38.258 --> 1:07:40.593
in a way nobody else ever has.

1:07:40.627 --> 1:07:42.228
Can't quite explain why.

1:07:43.296 --> 1:07:44.898
Merry Christmas, Leo.

1:07:54.541 --> 1:07:56.343
This town doesn't deserve you.

1:08:02.449 --> 1:08:04.084
You came here to gloat?

1:08:04.117 --> 1:08:07.821
I came here to invite you
to Christmas brunch.

1:08:07.854 --> 1:08:11.624
Me and Johnny
and Allie and Tripp

1:08:11.658 --> 1:08:14.060
we're calling it
"A Very Swappy Christmas."

1:08:15.161 --> 1:08:17.897
You want me there
after I tried to evict you?

1:08:19.199 --> 1:08:21.701
Well, you're an awful Grinch.

1:08:21.735 --> 1:08:23.803
But you're still my mom.

1:08:23.837 --> 1:08:26.239
And I know there's a great
big heart in there somewhere.

1:08:27.674 --> 1:08:28.708
I love you, baby.

1:08:28.742 --> 1:08:30.310
[chuckles]

1:08:30.343 --> 1:08:31.478
I love you, too, Mama/

1:08:31.511 --> 1:08:33.046
- Oh...
- Merry Christmas.

1:08:33.046 --> 1:08:35.882
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:08:38.318 --> 1:08:40.053
Did Santa come?

1:08:40.053 --> 1:08:41.621
Is it time to open presents?

1:08:41.654 --> 1:08:42.589
[chuckles]

1:08:42.622 --> 1:08:43.857
Oh, yeah, my darling.

1:08:47.327 --> 1:08:51.064
But we do have a gift for you.

1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:54.868
SYDNEY: Sami?

1:08:54.901 --> 1:08:57.337
What are you doing
in my room?

1:08:57.370 --> 1:08:58.838
Well.

1:09:01.107 --> 1:09:02.676
Sydney...

1:09:02.709 --> 1:09:04.911
your Christmas wish...

1:09:05.011 --> 1:09:06.079
has come true.

1:09:08.314 --> 1:09:09.783
I'm your mommy.

1:09:09.816 --> 1:09:11.785
What?

1:09:11.818 --> 1:09:13.520
You are?

1:09:13.553 --> 1:09:14.888
She is?

1:09:14.921 --> 1:09:15.822
She is.

1:09:17.223 --> 1:09:19.526
Nothing could make me happier.

1:09:19.559 --> 1:09:22.295
I love Christmas, mommy.

1:09:22.328 --> 1:09:23.730
And I love you.

1:09:23.763 --> 1:09:26.232
Oh, sweetheart,
I love you so much.

1:09:28.234 --> 1:09:29.369
[sniffles]

1:09:31.204 --> 1:09:32.405
[laughing]

1:09:36.309 --> 1:09:37.577
- Excuse me.
- Uh, wait.

1:09:41.581 --> 1:09:42.449
Hi.

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:43.516
Hi.

1:09:45.919 --> 1:09:47.654
I can't stop
thinking about that...

1:09:47.687 --> 1:09:49.656
little performance
you gave last night.

1:09:52.625 --> 1:09:54.961
Well, we've already
established that you...

1:09:55.061 --> 1:09:57.931
like my hard body.

1:09:57.964 --> 1:09:59.666
- I do.
- Hm.

1:09:59.699 --> 1:10:02.802
I do, but it-- no,
it was more what you said.

1:10:02.836 --> 1:10:04.704
Actually, what you wrote.

1:10:04.738 --> 1:10:05.839
And...

1:10:07.307 --> 1:10:09.175
I just want to tell you
that I love you, too.

1:10:12.812 --> 1:10:15.448
- You do?
- I do.

1:10:15.482 --> 1:10:17.150
I mean,
I really, really do.

1:10:18.752 --> 1:10:21.121
And I want to be with you.

1:10:21.154 --> 1:10:22.355
For real.

1:10:23.890 --> 1:10:25.458
If you still have me.

1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:28.695
Oh, God, Kristen.

1:10:41.975 --> 1:10:43.076
Come on.

1:10:43.109 --> 1:10:44.344
[grunts]

1:10:44.377 --> 1:10:46.212
Such a big girl!

1:10:46.246 --> 1:10:48.648
Hold on, let me
get the bed ready.

1:10:48.682 --> 1:10:50.417
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1:10:50.450 --> 1:10:51.918
Let's take those slippers

1:10:55.288 --> 1:10:57.090
There you go.

1:10:57.123 --> 1:10:58.858
Now...

1:10:58.892 --> 1:11:00.493
You close your eyes

1:11:00.527 --> 1:11:03.063
so that Santa
can deliver your presents.

1:11:04.364 --> 1:11:05.832
And we'll see you
in the morning.

1:11:09.336 --> 1:11:10.503
[sighs]

1:11:16.076 --> 1:11:17.544
[EJ exhales]

1:11:29.422 --> 1:11:30.957
I can't believe it.

1:11:30.990 --> 1:11:33.560
I can't believe
she's really mine.

1:11:33.593 --> 1:11:36.363
She's our child, Samantha.

1:11:38.098 --> 1:11:39.466
I meant to be a family.

1:11:41.801 --> 1:11:45.305
When I fix all this mess
with Nicole,

1:11:45.338 --> 1:11:46.806
maybe you and I can...

1:11:49.676 --> 1:11:52.278
Maybe you and I could...

1:12:11.064 --> 1:12:12.565
What a Christmas.

1:12:15.869 --> 1:12:17.671
And the awful truth came out.

1:12:19.239 --> 1:12:20.407
Oh, God.

1:12:21.408 --> 1:12:23.376
Please, forgive me.

1:12:28.081 --> 1:12:30.183
You know what?
I take that back.

1:12:30.216 --> 1:12:33.286
After what I did to Sydney
and EJ and Sami,

1:12:33.319 --> 1:12:35.088
I don't deserve forgiveness.

1:12:55.475 --> 1:12:57.410
MAN: Everyone
deserves forgiveness.

1:13:03.883 --> 1:13:05.218
[gasps]

1:13:15.495 --> 1:13:16.629
[door opens]

1:13:19.299 --> 1:13:20.567
Oof.

1:13:22.068 --> 1:13:23.069
Oh...

1:13:23.069 --> 1:13:24.270
John?

1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:28.508
Ah, hey.

1:13:31.978 --> 1:13:33.880
Is everything all right?

1:13:40.787 --> 1:13:42.355
Kristen and I we're...

1:13:43.957 --> 1:13:45.558
We're gonna get a divorce.

1:13:46.826 --> 1:13:49.229
Oh.

1:13:49.262 --> 1:13:51.131
I'm so sorry.

1:13:53.967 --> 1:13:55.168
Thank you, Doc.

1:13:58.204 --> 1:13:59.673
Doc.

1:14:02.275 --> 1:14:03.943
You haven't
called me that in years.

1:14:06.713 --> 1:14:08.815
No, I guess I haven't.

1:14:14.554 --> 1:14:16.856
Would you like to sit
with me for a little bit?

1:14:19.959 --> 1:14:21.294
I would.

1:14:49.089 --> 1:14:50.857
[clock chiming]

1:14:55.395 --> 1:14:57.097
Well, look at that.

1:14:59.265 --> 1:15:00.500
All right...

1:15:04.437 --> 1:15:06.272
Merry Christmas, Doc.

1:15:11.077 --> 1:15:12.712
Merry Christmas, John.

1:15:29.596 --> 1:15:32.332
WILL: "And as they nuzzle up
in front of the roaring fire,

1:15:32.365 --> 1:15:34.801
"snow falling gently outside,

1:15:34.834 --> 1:15:36.936
"the clock chimes midnight

1:15:36.970 --> 1:15:39.072
and we fade to white."

1:15:39.105 --> 1:15:42.075
"The end."

1:15:42.108 --> 1:15:44.077
And?

1:15:44.077 --> 1:15:46.246
Just under the wire.

1:15:46.279 --> 1:15:48.448
All that's left
is to hit "send."

1:15:48.481 --> 1:15:49.349
Shall we--

1:15:49.382 --> 1:15:50.083
Shall we do it together?

1:15:50.083 --> 1:15:51.418
Yes, please.

1:15:53.119 --> 1:15:54.454
[chuckles]
Okay.

1:15:54.487 --> 1:15:55.722
Thank you so much.

1:15:55.755 --> 1:15:57.157
Thank you so much for
helping me with this.

1:15:57.190 --> 1:15:58.291
Of course.

1:15:58.324 --> 1:16:00.193
We just, like,
completed a miracle.

1:16:00.226 --> 1:16:01.428
Yeah, and you know what?

1:16:01.461 --> 1:16:04.564
We got to spend
Christmas in Salem.

1:16:06.032 --> 1:16:07.734
Even if we couldn't
actually be there in person,

1:16:07.767 --> 1:16:10.170
You know,
writing all that...

1:16:10.203 --> 1:16:11.771
it made me miss it.

1:16:11.805 --> 1:16:12.839
You know?

1:16:12.872 --> 1:16:14.074
Miss them.

1:16:15.141 --> 1:16:16.376
Yeah, me, too.

1:16:17.477 --> 1:16:18.678
We'll have to visit soon.

1:16:21.414 --> 1:16:22.549
Hm.

1:16:22.582 --> 1:16:23.850
It's midnight here, too.

1:16:26.353 --> 1:16:28.254
Merry Christmas, honey.

1:16:28.288 --> 1:16:29.789
Merry Christmas...

1:16:29.823 --> 1:16:30.924
pookie.

1:16:30.957 --> 1:16:31.891
[laughing]

1:16:44.904 --> 1:16:48.441
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!

1:17:04.124 --> 1:17:04.224
