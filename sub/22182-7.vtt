WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.238
You're the first Special
Ops chick I ever met.

00:04.272 --> 00:06.140
How do you control yourself
around so many hot, sweaty men?

00:06.174 --> 00:07.608
The only hard part's
the smell, sir.
(laughs)

00:08.442 --> 00:09.810
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:09.843 --> 00:11.112
They have the package.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.817
The prisoner who got away
is Davis Goundry.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.885
We stumbled onto something here.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.554
What if we made a mistake
that night in Somalia?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.256
What if we let a terrorist
go free?

00:22.290 --> 00:23.457
Davis Goundry is still alive.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.426
MAGNUS:
You recruited him into the CIA.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.460
You know how he thinks
better than anyone.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.628
I want you to bring him in.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.829
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam has been captured

00:28.862 --> 00:30.264
along with Sergeant Hendrix,

00:30.298 --> 00:31.832
and we are
assembling a team

00:31.865 --> 00:33.234
to execute a rescue mission.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.535
In your work
at the newspaper,

00:34.568 --> 00:35.536
have you ever been involved

00:35.569 --> 00:37.205
in leaking
classified information?

00:37.238 --> 00:38.839
If you decide to go down
this road, call me.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.142
Where do you think
they're taking us now?
I don't know,

00:41.175 --> 00:42.243
but they should've used
more than one guard.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.112
Now.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.779
(grunting)

00:46.847 --> 00:50.151
(both shout)

00:50.184 --> 00:51.319
(groaning)

00:51.352 --> 00:54.155
Hey, you with me?

00:54.188 --> 00:55.289
Not for much longer.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.164
* Oh, yeah

01:04.898 --> 01:07.301
* Oh, yeah

01:07.335 --> 01:11.339
* It's been blood, sweat,
tears and pain *

01:11.372 --> 01:14.675
* Waiting so long
for the glory days *

01:14.708 --> 01:17.678
* Slave my life away

01:17.711 --> 01:21.149
* Working so hard
for the glory days *

01:21.182 --> 01:23.651
* Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

01:23.684 --> 01:27.155
* Working so hard
for the glory days. *

01:27.188 --> 01:29.523
What's wrong?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.794
Sergeant Hendrix is dead.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.167
What about Jimmy?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.170
It says they believe
he's still alive.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.871
How do they know any of this?

01:43.904 --> 01:46.907
An anonymous source leaked
that there are POWs.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.877
Paper started digging.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.214
They found out that the
military just notified

01:53.247 --> 01:57.185
Sergeant Hendrix's family and
they... they ran with it.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.586
Press found out
before we did.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.329
*

02:15.303 --> 02:17.705
(reporters clamoring)

02:17.738 --> 02:19.340
REPORTER:
Congresswoman Porter,

02:19.373 --> 02:20.708
did you know
about the POWs?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.511
Why did the army
cover it up?

02:26.247 --> 02:29.283
I'm sorry it happened like this.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.520
My intention was to tell you
about Sergeant Hendrix's death

02:32.553 --> 02:34.888
after his family
had been notified.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.591
The Honorable Simone Porter
would like to say a few words.

02:40.328 --> 02:44.732
The loss of Sergeant Hendrix
is a great tragedy.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.201
Nearly as upsetting is the fact

02:47.235 --> 02:50.738
that someone leaked classified
information to the press.

02:50.771 --> 02:55.243
The House Intel Committee
chose you for this mission,

02:55.276 --> 02:57.578
but due to this security breach,

02:57.611 --> 03:00.548
our confidence has been
severely damaged.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.352
If we learn that one of you
leaked this story,

03:04.385 --> 03:07.321
we will assign a new unit
to bring Sergeant Kam home.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.894
Army CID is investigating
the leak.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.398
So, if you know anything,
you better speak up.

03:17.431 --> 03:21.402
In the meantime, the best way to
honor Sergeant Hendrix's memory

03:21.435 --> 03:23.637
is to focus on the mission
at hand.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.740
Tonight, you will take the C-17
to Camp Lemonnier,

03:26.774 --> 03:29.343
then deploy to Ethiopia
to chase an illegal arms deal

03:29.377 --> 03:31.812
between Khalid Samatar
and an ISIS cell.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.947
Recent chatter
indicates the deal

03:33.981 --> 03:35.916
is for arms
and one package.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.318
We believe the package is Jimmy

03:37.351 --> 03:39.420
and the arms
are enriched uranium.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.655
Ma'am, where'd
Khalid get uranium?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.823
Somalia has
one of the largest

03:42.856 --> 03:43.957
uranium black markets
in the world.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.626
We knew Khalid had a stash,

03:45.659 --> 03:46.960
thought we'd find
it in the hospital

03:46.994 --> 03:48.028
after the prisoner swap.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.397
No such luck.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.964
We believe ISIS wants to use it

03:50.998 --> 03:52.433
to build a dirty bomb.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.503
We can't let that happen.
Porter.

03:55.536 --> 03:59.440
The sale is being brokered by an
arms dealer named Orson Lavoy.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.709
He is a U.S./France dual citizen

04:01.742 --> 04:04.678
and has arrest warrants here
and in four other countries.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.714
Once you recover Jimmy
and the uranium,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.916
you'll detain Mr. Lavoy and
bring him in for questioning.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.953
Sergeant Darzi is
still in recovery,

04:12.986 --> 04:15.523
so, Renegade One-Two,
you'll have a new crew chief.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.325
Sergeant Cho.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.429
Takeoff is
in two hours.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.297
Dismissed.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.765
OTHERS:
Hooah!

04:29.970 --> 04:31.539
I hope this isn't weird.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.542
The mission or...
the other thing?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.644
(chuckles):
The other thing.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.945
I mean, we're cool.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.380
It was fun, right?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.948
Hell, yeah.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.317
SMITTY:
That's a lot of estrogen

04:43.351 --> 04:44.552
in one bird.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.354
Well, they'll
probably sync up

04:46.387 --> 04:47.455
their periods.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.756
Ain't that right, Cho-Cho?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.425
Biologically,
menstrual synchrony

04:51.459 --> 04:53.461
is a protective mechanism,

04:53.494 --> 04:56.430
so the female can't
be taken advantage of
by the dominant male.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.499
And since we don't have
any dominant males,

04:58.532 --> 05:00.434
I think we're safe.
(chuckles)

05:02.069 --> 05:03.604
*

05:07.608 --> 05:09.643
Everything all right?

05:09.677 --> 05:12.079
No. This leak could mean

05:12.112 --> 05:13.514
we're off this operation.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.083
Who would do that?
Eye on the prize, Madani.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.085
This is your
first mission clean.

05:19.853 --> 05:20.921
No room for mistakes.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.357
Then I won't make any.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.028
WOMAN: I'd be a mess
if this happened to me, but...

05:28.061 --> 05:29.663
Mm.
you look like
you're doing okay.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.699
Oh, I think I'm still in shock.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.701
Well, of course.
Your husband's face
was plastered

05:33.734 --> 05:35.403
all over America,
and you had

05:35.436 --> 05:37.705
no say in the matter.
We're all praying

05:37.738 --> 05:39.139
for Sergeant Kam.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.375
Well, I'm grateful for that.
Thank you.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.410
(knocking)

05:45.078 --> 05:47.748
Congresswoman Porter.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.784
Uh... come in.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.053
Thank you.
Um, ladies.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.757
I can't stay long,
Mrs. Kam.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.460
I just...
came to express

05:59.493 --> 06:01.962
my profound concern
about your husband's situation.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.764
I appreciate that, ma'am.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.466
I'm so sorry

06:05.499 --> 06:06.834
you're having to deal
with this media circus.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.502
The leak has shown me

06:08.536 --> 06:10.971
I need to rethink
the entire rescue operation.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.542
Rest assured,
we are handling it.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.611
I will make certain that your
husband is not forgotten in D.C.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.580
We'll get him home.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.024
*

06:33.494 --> 06:36.063
MADANI: Anchor Zero-Six,
this is Renegade One-Two.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.631
We're in position.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.200
Renegade One-Two,
Reaper confirms target. Verify?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.168
No joy.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.004
Confirm coordinates. Over.
MADANI: Stand by,

06:44.037 --> 06:45.038
Anchor Zero-Six.
We have confirmation

06:45.072 --> 06:46.807
on a visual, three o'clock.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.208
Large black van.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.677
Signage says something
in Arabic.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.844
Sparrow?

06:51.879 --> 06:53.914
THEA:
"Erasto's Funeral Home."

06:53.947 --> 06:56.684
Plate is 2-7-1-niner-1-3.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.152
PORTER:
Company is legit.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.654
But wait.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.456
The license plates
aren't registered to it.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.892
PORTER:
Renegade One-Two,

07:04.925 --> 07:05.959
that van is your target.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.728
Roger that, Anchor Zero-Six.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.834
"There's no place
like home," sir?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.236
Go for it, Madani.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.905
You have the controls.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.841
I have the controls.
Hey, Renegade One-One,

07:20.874 --> 07:24.945
you ever see The Wizard of Oz?
Yes, ma'am, I take it
there's a tornado coming.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
Affirmative.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
Renegade One-One
moving into position.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.487
*

07:54.975 --> 07:56.577
How am I doing, Tin Man?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.778
You're nailing
it, Dorothy.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.747
Now, let's just hope
Jimmy's in there.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.825
GALLO:
He's got a gun!

08:18.666 --> 08:20.968
Orson Lavoy, get out of the van!

08:21.001 --> 08:23.036
Hands where we can see them!

08:23.070 --> 08:25.639
Whoa. Okay. Okay.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.815
LAVOY:
What seems to be the problem?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.950
Okay. Okay.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.652
Not smart.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.554
You should've let me
take that shot.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.655
I saw the opening,

08:41.689 --> 08:43.090
so I took it.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.558
You could've killed Lavoy.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.626
Sidestep again,

08:45.659 --> 08:46.727
and I'll make...
COOGAN: Hey!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.662
Hey! She didn't do it
by the book,

08:48.696 --> 08:50.631
but she handled it, Smitty.
Relax.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.566
Coogan, with me.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.908
This is Anchor Zero-Six.
Confirm. Do you have

09:00.941 --> 09:02.743
Sergeant Kam?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.744
Stand by, Anchor Zero-Six.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.814
Sergeant Kam!

09:06.847 --> 09:09.750
Sergeant Jimmy Kam!

09:13.721 --> 09:15.188
All we have

09:15.222 --> 09:18.058
is a coffin in here.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.059
You don't think
that's...?

09:19.092 --> 09:20.227
No, it's how Lavoy's

09:20.260 --> 09:21.695
transporting the uranium.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.663
He had to cross borders,

09:22.696 --> 09:24.097
pass checkpoint inspections.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.099
Right, and who's
gonna open a casket?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.267
We are.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.680
Anchor Zero-Six,
we have the body

09:39.713 --> 09:41.715
of Sergeant Hendrix.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.620
What?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.722
Oh, God.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.624
No, that makes no sense.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.759
Gallo, what are you doing?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.397
Captain, what are you doing
outside the helo?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.966
No! Stop!
I want to see for myself.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.702
*

10:20.320 --> 10:22.322
Delta Force!

10:22.355 --> 10:25.225
Sound off for roll call
when I call your name.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.426
Sergeant Smith!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.295
Here, Sergeant Major!

10:28.328 --> 10:29.730
Sergeant Coogan!

10:29.763 --> 10:31.231
Here, Sergeant Major!

10:31.264 --> 10:32.833
Sergeant Hendrix!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.138
Sergeant Shane D. Hendrix.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.711
Sergeant Shane Dylan Hendrix.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.782
Present arms.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.721
("Taps" playing)

11:22.382 --> 11:26.019
HASKINS:
I know it's been
a rough few days.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.456
And even though
we didn't get Jimmy yet,

11:29.489 --> 11:31.458
you have brought
a sense of closure

11:31.491 --> 11:34.261
to the Hendrix family
by bringing his body home.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.796
Thank you.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.300
His wake will be this Friday.
The family has asked me

11:40.333 --> 11:42.135
to extend an invitation
to all of you.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.106
Grief will hit you.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.275
And when it does,
don't be proud.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.810
Reach out.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.946
All right. Intel.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.148
We gather that Khalid intended

11:55.182 --> 11:56.817
to sell Sergeant Hendrix's body

11:56.850 --> 11:59.820
as part of the deal with ISIS;
he was the package.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.389
A dead U.S. soldier is
Internet gold for our enemies.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.457
HASKINS:
We believe Sergeant Kam

12:04.491 --> 12:06.827
is still alive.
The question is: where?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.461
We have Orson Lavoy
in custody.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
We're hoping he'll have
some answers.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.867
Lieutenant Porter and I
will run that interrogation.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.335
HASKINS: As soon as they get
intel out of Lavoy,

12:15.368 --> 12:18.338
you'll be back in the air,
so rest up and be ready.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.774
Dismissed.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.909
Hooah!

12:25.345 --> 12:28.982
We're counting on you to
crack him, Lieutenant Porter.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.184
You got this.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.221
I hope she's right.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.890
'Cause this is the only lead
we have right now.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.792
I'm well aware of that, Captain.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.961
Excuse me.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.933
JESS:
Reporters keep calling.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.935
And I sent Max to
my parents' house,

12:47.968 --> 12:49.369
because there's press at
the front gates every day.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.171
Next time you
need to leave,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.206
I can go with you
if that'd help.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.942
Thank you.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.376
So is there any news
you can share?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.545
About Jimmy?

12:58.578 --> 13:02.582
No, just that we're
working on it, but...

13:02.615 --> 13:04.852
they think this came
from the inside.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.319
Seriously?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.888
Yeah. They're even talking about

13:07.921 --> 13:09.356
taking the Shadow Raiders
off the mission.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.291
That's not right.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.893
Then they'd bring in
a new unit,

13:12.926 --> 13:14.594
which would take, what?
A couple weeks

13:14.627 --> 13:16.596
to catch up to speed.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.298
And every second counts.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.133
If you hear anything

13:20.167 --> 13:22.135
that could help catch
who did this,

13:22.169 --> 13:24.571
let me know.
Of course.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.109
Is it weird that part of me

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
is glad that all of this
is finally out there?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
Yes.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.515
What good has it done, Jess?

13:35.548 --> 13:37.184
Simone Porter came by
here the other day.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.552
And she said that
she would make sure

13:39.586 --> 13:40.888
that Jimmy wasn't
forgotten and...

13:40.921 --> 13:42.856
We haven't forgotten Jimmy
either.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.858
Of course.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.559
I just meant that...

13:46.593 --> 13:48.095
No. I-I know.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.867
We're just all under
a lot of stress lately.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.640
You think we got all the uranium
from Khalid's stash?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.377
There's reason to
believe he kept some.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.447
If he did, it's likely the same
place he's keeping Jimmy.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.950
All the more reason we got
to get this guy to talk.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.919
Mm-hmm.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.221
You ever done this before?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.956
Only in training.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.126
Never for real.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.962
Okay.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.500
Uh, Orson Lavoy, welcome.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.940
I will say nothing
without a lawyer.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.242
See, we're trying
to find someone

14:35.275 --> 14:36.643
willing to take your case.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.946
Surprise, surprise.
Not a lot of lawyers

14:38.979 --> 14:41.014
want to represent
an arms dealer responsible

14:41.048 --> 14:42.983
for countless
innocent deaths,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.617
so until somebody
steps forward,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.119
you're stuck with us.

14:46.153 --> 14:49.489
So let's try this
the easy way.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.324
You had one American POW
in the back of your van.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.160
There are two.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.528
Where's the other American,
Lavoy? Where's Jimmy?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.966
(speaking French)

15:03.971 --> 15:05.072
He doesn't want the easy way.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.541
Charming.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.077
Oui.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.979
The hard way it is, then.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.983
Rest up, Lavoy. This is as good
as it's gonna get.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.692
I got here as fast
as I could, but you
shouldn't have called me.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.061
I used the burner phone.
And I had to sign
in at the gate.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.063
I'll tell them that
you were bringing Max's...

15:30.097 --> 15:32.532
Jess, we need to cover
our tracks, not make new ones.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.135
The deal was I give you
the POW story,

15:35.168 --> 15:37.104
and you keep me in the loop.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.639
Why didn't you tell me
Sergeant Hendrix was dead?

15:39.672 --> 15:40.573
Because I didn't know.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.210
After I sent your
story to the Ledger,

15:43.243 --> 15:44.644
they found that out
on their own.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.079
Apparently,

15:46.113 --> 15:47.447
they might take
the Shadow Raiders

15:47.480 --> 15:50.150
off the rescue mission
because of the leak.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.253
I never would have done any
of this if I would have known

15:53.286 --> 15:54.654
that could happen.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.423
I warned you.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.125
Once it's out there, you
can't control what happens.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.728
Maybe I should just come clean.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.230
No.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.065
If anyone finds
out you did it,

16:05.098 --> 16:06.366
you'll be in a
mess of trouble.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.302
You're all your
son has right now.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.238
You need to protect
yourself, for him.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.140
All right?

16:15.075 --> 16:17.077
And we shouldn't
meet again.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.806
Colonel says he's still waiting
for the mission write-up.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.375
What's the holdup?

16:48.408 --> 16:51.044
Yeah, doesn't
seem too pressing

16:51.078 --> 16:54.581
now this whole thing's
gone sideways.

16:54.614 --> 16:58.118
We're back to square one
with Jimmy.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.053
We have Lavoy.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.388
They think he might
have answers.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.091
Yeah, if your boyfriend
can get it out of him.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.296
Look, we made
two failed rescue attempts.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.298
Darzi got injured.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.833
Sergeant Hendrix is dead.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.103
Could be Jimmy is, too.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.172
You can't think that.
Well, I am thinking it.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.210
Tell me this.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.848
Why does a guy who's
been to hell and back

17:28.881 --> 17:31.084
suddenly start
questioning everything?

17:33.753 --> 17:36.289
I guess everybody's
got a breaking point.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.159
Right.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.827
I'm gonna go see Jess.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.329
(sighs)

17:42.362 --> 17:45.765
Don't give her any false hope,
Madani.

17:48.901 --> 17:54.574
This...
is Field Manual 2-22.3,

17:54.607 --> 17:57.677
the army's guidelines
for interrogation.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.679
Uh-huh.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.714
Oh, look.
It says we can do

18:01.748 --> 18:05.152
the "Emotional Love Approach."

18:05.185 --> 18:06.886
I still can't believe
they really call it that.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.123
Or... Here's a memo

18:10.157 --> 18:11.724
from the CIA
that says we can do

18:11.758 --> 18:16.129
whatever we want so long
as we get intel on Jimmy.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.730
This is
a legal minefield.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.467
Yeah, that's why the CIA
has really good lawyers.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.138
The Senate report
on CIA methods

18:25.172 --> 18:28.475
said enhanced interrogation
has never gotten reliable intel.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.344
You're well read, Lieutenant,
what's your point?

18:31.378 --> 18:33.246
My point is,
this is an army base.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.282
We need to
follow army regs

18:35.315 --> 18:36.783
and the laws of war.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.252
Do you think

18:39.286 --> 18:43.290
Orson Lavoy cared about the laws
of war when he armed terrorists?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.427
We need to do whatever it takes
to get him to talk.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.730
Don't tell me you've
never bent the rules.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.835
Quick time march!

18:57.470 --> 18:59.172
Class...

18:59.206 --> 19:00.307
halt.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.276
Wilton!

19:03.310 --> 19:04.444
You cheated back there on the
rope climb, didn't you?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.347
No, Sergeant.
Show me your hands!

19:09.349 --> 19:10.550
Thought so.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.885
I just found this
in your locker.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.687
Squad!

19:14.721 --> 19:17.524
Thanks to Sergeant Wilton,

19:17.557 --> 19:19.292
you're all doing The Push Up.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.494
ALL:
The Push Up!

19:22.662 --> 19:23.896
We need to recycle him.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.732
It's only his
second infraction, sir.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.234
Seems a little early.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.436
He's not responding
to the training.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.938
Either you show him the door
or exercise some discipline.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.407
I've used all the disciplinary
methods approved by Army.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.410
Okay, then use
another one.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.980
Freshman year at West Point,
we had to recite

19:41.013 --> 19:42.782
the entire menu
to the upperclassmen.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.318
If we missed a single word,

19:45.352 --> 19:47.554
they'd drag us out of bed
in the middle of the night

19:47.587 --> 19:49.422
and they'd beat your ass.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.392
One time through that,
I never screwed up again.

19:54.327 --> 19:58.298
Do what you have to do
to make a soldier out of him.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.799
Yes, sir.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.568
Wilton!

20:01.601 --> 20:03.336
Since your hands

20:03.370 --> 20:06.373
are so tough, why don't you
low-crawl back to the dorms?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.840
Sergeant, that's
a mile away.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.941
Move!

20:08.975 --> 20:11.744
(grunts)

20:11.778 --> 20:14.647
Lower!

20:16.616 --> 20:18.718
I have bent the rules before,
ma'am.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.290
But it doesn't always work out
the way that you want.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.692
Okay.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.494
We'll try it your way,
Lieutenant Porter.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.762
But the longer it takes,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.398
the farther away
from Jimmy we get.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.802
Thank you, ma'am.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.273
(indistinct chatter)

20:43.443 --> 20:44.544
Have you heard
from your husband?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.313
I cannot believe
these people.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.680
It's okay, we're
almost through.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.881
How's your son doing?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.049
Mrs. Kam, can you give
us an interview?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.618
I'm such an idiot.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.487
It's not your fault.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.838
Why do you blame yourself?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.706
What do you mean?

21:13.740 --> 21:17.410
For the leak. It sounded
like you blame yourself.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.379
Oh, I don't know.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.647
I...
(laughs)

21:20.680 --> 21:22.882
I'm just frustrated.
That's all.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.884
Jess.

21:26.085 --> 21:29.656
Jess, don't
lie to me.
I'm not!

21:29.689 --> 21:31.691
Jess, I know you. I can
tell when you're lying.

21:31.724 --> 21:32.925
Look at me.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.062
Did you leak the story?

21:42.569 --> 21:44.937
Yes.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.682
Jess, how could you do this?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.550
I thought it would help.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.587
And I didn't want
to lie to my son anymore.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.355
Well, you had no
problem lying to me.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.557
Now you know how it feels!

22:04.591 --> 22:07.059
Sucks to be kept
in the dark, doesn't it?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.729
Keeping you in the dark
is not meant to hurt you.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.764
We can carry
out a rescue

22:11.798 --> 22:13.366
way more safely in secret.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.436
I did what I thought was best.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.671
You signed an NDA. Do you know
they can prosecute you for this?

22:18.705 --> 22:20.072
I didn't know what I was signing

22:20.106 --> 22:21.774
when they shoved those papers
in front of me.

22:21.808 --> 22:25.745
Look, I held on
as long as I could,

22:25.778 --> 22:27.547
but the army did not move
fast enough.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.081
(scoffs)

22:29.115 --> 22:31.150
I'm sorry the army didn't move
fast enough for you.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.786
Clearly it didn't move fast
enough for Sergeant Hendrix!

22:33.820 --> 22:36.423
(scoffs)

22:37.524 --> 22:39.892
I'm sorry.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.965
Because of you,

22:45.998 --> 22:48.468
the Shadow Raiders could be
taken off the operation.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.102
I know, and I...

22:50.136 --> 22:52.772
But if I tell them
that it wasn't one of us

22:52.805 --> 22:55.642
who leaked,
that it was you,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.910
then we'll still be on.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.548
So what are you gonna do?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.618
Are you gonna tell?

23:05.652 --> 23:08.555
I don't know, but you should
find yourself another ride back.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.728
I'm gonna ask you this
one more time.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.431
Where is Khalid
keeping Jimmy Kam?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.507
Khalid sent us
this photo.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.875
Do you know
what the domino means?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.477
I'm a busy man. I'm not a child.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.744
I don't play dominoes.

23:31.778 --> 23:32.745
I didn't ask you that.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.046
Do you know what it means?

23:34.080 --> 23:36.583
I have no idea.
I just talk

23:36.616 --> 23:39.586
to him. I don't play
games with him, okay?

23:39.619 --> 23:40.887
So you did talk to Khalid?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.557
We now have you on tape
admitting that.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.759
(laughs)

23:46.793 --> 23:49.496
All right, that's enough.
Let's call it a night.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.465
PORTER:
What are you doing?

23:52.499 --> 23:55.468
I just got him to...
Yeah, after eight hours.
That's not enough.

23:55.502 --> 23:58.671
We're switching gears. Tomorrow,
we start doing things my way.

23:58.705 --> 24:01.708
It's your choice if you
want to participate.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.050
I needed a drink.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.854
You mind if I... join?

24:14.887 --> 24:17.990
How was your day
at work... dear?

24:18.024 --> 24:19.526
* And in the morning light...

24:19.559 --> 24:23.830
My coworker is a stickler
for the rules.

24:23.863 --> 24:28.167
Mm. Lieutenant Porter
is Mr. By-the-Book.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.539
Mm, yes. Yes, he is.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.542
* As long as my blood is warm

24:35.575 --> 24:38.277
* I need you...

24:38.310 --> 24:40.947
It's kind of hard to make
small talk with a spy.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.015
(laughs)

24:43.049 --> 24:45.585
Okay, well, then,
why don't you tell me

24:45.618 --> 24:48.120
about your day
at the office... dear?

24:48.154 --> 24:52.792
Well, Haskins wants my
post-mission report, and...

24:52.825 --> 24:54.260
I haven't started it yet.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.563
Why not?
Here's my report.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.065
We didn't get Jimmy...

24:59.098 --> 25:02.034
again, and...

25:02.068 --> 25:06.673
oh, yeah, I-I flew home
with a dead man on my bird.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.577
So... that about
sums it up.

25:10.610 --> 25:11.878
Where were you last week?

25:11.911 --> 25:15.147
On an assignment abroad.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.683
Did you get an "A"?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.718
(laughs softly)

25:18.751 --> 25:20.720
Epic fail, but thank you
for asking.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.755
* I need you...

25:24.323 --> 25:26.125
Yeah?

25:26.158 --> 25:29.829
* I need you, I need you...

25:29.862 --> 25:31.731
Want another one?

25:31.764 --> 25:35.635
* I need you.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.070
(crickets chirping)

25:39.839 --> 25:41.741
Hey.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.042
Hey.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.812
Sorry. Did I wake you?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.814
No.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.682
I can't sleep.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.984
What's wrong?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.886
Just thinking
about Jess.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.756
What about her?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.925
I don't know.

25:58.958 --> 26:02.094
What's with you?

26:02.128 --> 26:04.330
I need to decide how far I'll go

26:04.363 --> 26:06.666
to get an answer out of Lavoy.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.901
He's a thug.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.637
You go all the way.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.773
I can't stop thinking
about Sergeant Wilton.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.808
Wait.

26:15.842 --> 26:18.110
Wilton from... Air Assault?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.747
Back when we met?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.181
Yeah.

26:28.020 --> 26:33.259
Lavoy is responsible
for hundreds of deaths.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.829
Wilton was just a kid
trying to cheat the system.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.931
This is way different.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.267
Is it?

26:41.300 --> 26:44.270
After Wilton, I swore

26:44.303 --> 26:47.774
I would never resort
to violence if I could help it.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.876
Ian,

26:49.909 --> 26:52.278
there are times...

26:52.311 --> 26:55.915
when right and
wrong are clear.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.652
And then there
are other, more...

26:59.686 --> 27:02.822
in-between times.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.226
This is that type.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.197
So how do you choose?

27:11.230 --> 27:14.266
When it isn't clear
what's right?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.869
I don't know.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.942
I guess I just ask myself
how I want it to turn out.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.413
I want to bring Jimmy
and his family back together.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.751
Me, too.

27:31.784 --> 27:36.388
So... I think
the answer is...

27:36.422 --> 27:39.258
do whatever you think
has the best chance

27:39.291 --> 27:41.794
of making that happen.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.902
Thank you
for talking it through.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.806
Of course.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.408
It helped me, too.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.410
(both laughing)
* Picks me up
at half past ten... *

27:58.444 --> 28:00.479
Oh, man.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.850
* I sneak out the back
with my Bible and gin... *

28:03.883 --> 28:06.252
Well, I guess we are
closing this place down.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.721
Hmm.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.489
* Liftin' up my veil
so delicately... *

28:10.522 --> 28:12.191
Sorry. (laughs)

28:12.224 --> 28:14.493
I'm tra... I'm trashed.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.162
You're not
the only one.
Mm.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.164
* In the back of the bar...

28:18.197 --> 28:22.268
So, you and Zoe...
still a thing?

28:22.301 --> 28:24.403
Yeah, that wasn't a thing.

28:24.436 --> 28:29.408
It was fun, but it's a little
tricky for me to have things.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.811
Well, look at that.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.880
We got something
in common.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.748
Oh, yeah?

28:35.782 --> 28:37.850
Emotionally withholding?
Questionable choices?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.119
Reckless and heartless?

28:40.152 --> 28:42.922
Mm. Not heartless.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.925
I think, every once
in a while,

28:45.958 --> 28:48.928
though, we do need
to blow off some steam.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.262
Yeah.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.031
* So she married God
and made me, too *

28:52.064 --> 28:54.767
* But, Devil, I can't stop
thinkin' 'bout you... *

28:54.801 --> 28:57.269
I'm just gonna...

28:57.303 --> 29:00.306
ask this in my
reckless way.

29:00.339 --> 29:03.475
In a world where
you were into men...

29:03.509 --> 29:05.845
* I took it off
and let my convent down... *

29:05.878 --> 29:07.847
...what's your type?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.916
What makes you think
I'm not into men?

29:09.949 --> 29:11.984
I...

29:12.018 --> 29:13.519
Hmm?

29:13.552 --> 29:16.222
(both laugh softly)

29:20.860 --> 29:22.895
So...

29:22.929 --> 29:24.897
all systems are go?

29:24.931 --> 29:27.033
* Why does it feel like hell?

29:27.066 --> 29:28.968
Why not?

29:30.336 --> 29:32.839
* Why does it feel
like hell with you? *

29:32.872 --> 29:34.506
Questionable choices?

29:34.540 --> 29:36.943
I don't care.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.847
* Sister, I can't help it

29:40.880 --> 29:44.483
* It's too hot under the habit

29:44.516 --> 29:50.422
* I took it off
and let my convent down. *

30:01.467 --> 30:02.969
THEA:
You had

30:03.002 --> 30:04.570
one American POW in your van.

30:04.603 --> 30:05.972
Where is the other one?

30:07.073 --> 30:08.174
How did you contact Khalid

30:08.207 --> 30:09.408
to arrange the pick-up?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.077
Where did you meet Khalid

30:11.110 --> 30:14.180
to get the casket
with Sergeant Hendrix, huh?

30:14.213 --> 30:17.917
Did you have any knowledge
about another American POW?

30:17.950 --> 30:19.886
Did Khalid mention
another soldier

30:19.919 --> 30:21.954
besides Sergeant Hendrix?

30:21.988 --> 30:23.255
You need to tell me right now.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.925
Where is the other American?!

30:25.958 --> 30:27.894
Again.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.596
(blow lands, Lavoy groans)

30:30.629 --> 30:34.200
Ms. Madani, what
are you doing here?

30:34.233 --> 30:36.903
Came to see
Sergeant Wilton.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.471
Hope that's okay.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.075
It's from all of us recruits.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.143
I said I'd bring it.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.946
It's very thoughtful of you.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.418
We, uh...

30:53.652 --> 30:55.922
We heard he tried to end it?

30:55.955 --> 30:58.290
That is right.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.061
Sir,

31:02.094 --> 31:04.430
I can't help but feel like,

31:04.463 --> 31:05.965
maybe if he had had
a different instructor,

31:05.998 --> 31:07.399
this wouldn't have happened.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.672
What do you mean?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.174
Sergeant Wilton's
third generation Army.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.576
He's under crazy pressure
from his family.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.079
You coming down so hard on him
just made things worse.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.414
Perhaps if you had
shown him some kindness,

31:22.448 --> 31:25.284
would have turned out
a hell of a lot better.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.058
THEA:
Listen, we will work you over
until you break.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.692
(gasps)

31:33.725 --> 31:36.095
Mr. Lavoy,
you need to tell me right...

31:38.130 --> 31:40.166
(sighs)

31:40.199 --> 31:41.934
THEA:
Lieutenant Porter.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.002
You decided to join us.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.336
Yes, ma'am.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.072
You can take five.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.274
So far he's said
nothing useful.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.056
Why arms dealing?

32:04.090 --> 32:05.524
Why get into this life?

32:05.557 --> 32:08.360
What made you stop caring
about people's lives?

32:08.394 --> 32:12.264
I'm a businessman.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.300
That is all.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.039
Lieutenant Porter,
what the hell do you...?

32:20.072 --> 32:22.941
Just give me a second.

32:28.214 --> 32:31.650
At one point you were
a family man, though.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.053
Right, Alexandre?

32:34.086 --> 32:37.523
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.092
Orson Lavoy has no family,

32:40.126 --> 32:42.261
but Alexandre Guillaume...

32:44.096 --> 32:46.532
...he was a family man.

32:46.565 --> 32:50.136
And that was your
name once, right?

32:55.441 --> 32:59.678
"Lucas, you are the most
beautiful Christmas gift."

33:04.550 --> 33:06.652
I did some digging.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.154
15 years ago--

33:08.187 --> 33:10.056
before you changed your name,

33:10.089 --> 33:11.657
before you chose this life--

33:11.690 --> 33:14.660
your wife and your son,

33:14.693 --> 33:17.429
Lucas, were killed

33:17.463 --> 33:19.165
in a home invasion robbery.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.268
Jimmy Kam,

33:22.301 --> 33:24.236
the man that we are
trying to find,

33:24.270 --> 33:28.140
he has a wife and a son.

33:28.174 --> 33:30.609
I want to bring
them back together.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.127
What if we can protect you?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.129
We have ways of making
people disappear.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.630
New identities.

33:51.663 --> 33:54.366
Please. Just-just
tell us what you know.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.468
Help us find Jimmy Kam

33:56.502 --> 33:58.104
before Khalid kills him.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.671
His son needs a father.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.308
You can't bring
your family back,

34:02.341 --> 34:04.210
but you can help this one.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.446
(groans)

34:09.481 --> 34:13.119
I don't know where
this Jimmy is, but...

34:16.122 --> 34:18.257
...I know someone
who might help you.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.725
Who?

34:19.758 --> 34:21.593
He's Khalid's right-hand man.

34:21.627 --> 34:22.861
He's an American.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.563
He goes by the name of Bucky.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.432
Bucky?
What kind of name is that?

34:26.465 --> 34:27.566
I'm pretty sure

34:27.599 --> 34:30.469
it's not his real one.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.605
But he would know
all of Khalid's safe houses.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.141
The places he would keep someone

34:35.174 --> 34:37.276
as valuable
as an American soldier.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.280
Khalid said

34:41.313 --> 34:43.149
that he and Bucky
had a falling out,

34:43.182 --> 34:46.152
and it got so bad
that Khalid tried to kill him,

34:46.185 --> 34:47.553
but Bucky escaped.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.489
Khalid thought
that he might be headed here.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.158
Here?

34:52.191 --> 34:54.226
In the U.S.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.229
If you can find Bucky,

34:57.263 --> 35:00.166
he might help you find your man.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.504
Is that Bucky?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.407
That's him.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.412
You did good work in there.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.716
So, who is he?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.685
In the photo.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.254
His real name is Davis Goundry.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.855
He used to work for us.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.225
For the CIA?
Mm-hmm.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.659
Did you know him?

35:27.693 --> 35:29.895
That, Lieutenant Porter,

35:29.928 --> 35:31.597
is not a question
I'm gonna answer.

35:44.210 --> 35:47.313
To, uh, Sergeant Hendrix.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.181
Sergeant Hendrix.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.849
Hey, hey.
Whoa, hey.

35:50.882 --> 35:51.983
You're drunk, man.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.186
Maybe you should get some food,
soak up that booze, huh?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.187
How about you

35:55.221 --> 35:57.656
bite me?
Okay.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.359
Captain Gallo, bartender
says your burger's ready.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.362
There you go.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.406
Hey.
Hey.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.708
Ladies, do you mind
excusing us for a second?

36:16.742 --> 36:19.311
Okay, sure.

36:22.581 --> 36:26.352
I'm glad you came.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.621
I was not expecting you
to say that.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.323
Well, even though

36:31.357 --> 36:34.426
I'm breaking, like,
six dozen rules,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.662
I'm not gonna tell what you did.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.332
I asked myself

36:40.366 --> 36:43.402
how I wanted this
to turn out, and...

36:43.435 --> 36:47.339
the answer is with you
and Jimmy and Max together.

36:47.373 --> 36:51.009
And if I tell, who knows
what happens to you?

36:51.042 --> 36:53.412
Kind of defeats
the purpose, huh?

36:53.445 --> 36:55.981
Thank you.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.450
I still think it was wrong.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.389
But I understand.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.696
Hey.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.997
I'll get two Irish whiskeys.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.265
Neat.

37:13.299 --> 37:16.034
(laughs) Go easy.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.304
The guy's a lightweight.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.573
Do me a favor.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.375
Put this one behind the bar

37:23.409 --> 37:24.543
for Sergeant Hendrix.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.314
To Sergeant Hendrix.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.350
A good man who will live on
in our hearts.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.684
Sergeant Hendrix.
Sergeant Hendrix.

37:32.718 --> 37:33.719
PORTER:
Cheers.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.558
You didn't know him, man.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.893
Why are you acting
like you knew him?

37:41.927 --> 37:45.063
I know that he was
a great soldier.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.734
Right.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.538
And what would you know
about that?

37:52.571 --> 37:55.073
'Cause the closest thing
you ever got

37:55.106 --> 37:58.777
to a battlefield is
a PowerPoint presentation.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.412
Man, you are way out
of line, Captain.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.647
You better check yourself.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.782
Screw you, man.
You...

38:03.815 --> 38:05.451
Hey, buddy.
Hey!

38:05.484 --> 38:06.918
Hey, what the hell, man?
Come on!

38:06.952 --> 38:07.853
Easy, easy.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.388
Easy.
Come on!

38:09.421 --> 38:11.657
Hey, you're all right.
HASKINS: Captain Gallo.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.025
You just shoved
a fellow officer?
Sir...

38:14.059 --> 38:16.662
You are grounded from flying,
effective now.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.464
You are lucky I'm not giving you

38:18.497 --> 38:19.898
an Article 15.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.867
(sighs)
Get the hell out of here.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.606
(clicks tongue)

38:41.420 --> 38:45.123
What's wrong with you?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.626
I screwed up.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.365
You want to get out of here?

38:55.401 --> 38:57.536
Uh-uh. No. No.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.605
Tonight I'm your taxi driver.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.573
We promised
it was a onetime thing.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.676
I meant onetime thing

39:04.710 --> 39:06.678
for that night.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.548
(chuckles)

39:11.550 --> 39:14.853
* Your face like porcelain

39:14.886 --> 39:18.089
I thought you said you
were just my taxi driver.
(chuckles)

39:18.123 --> 39:20.392
I was.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.860
I drove you
straight to my bed.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.995
(chuckles)
(panting)

39:24.029 --> 39:25.531
* Eyes like daggers

39:25.564 --> 39:27.966
That didn't seem a good time
to leave you alone.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.170
See? I'm not heartless.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.472
* Where do I begin?

39:33.505 --> 39:34.473
Hmm.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.174
You got any beer

39:36.207 --> 39:37.676
in this place?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.044
Yeah, it's in the fridge.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.412
Help yourself. I'm good.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.120
* She's a wild one

39:49.154 --> 39:53.191
* She's a wild one next to me

39:53.224 --> 39:56.495
* She's a wild one,
she's a wild one *

39:56.528 --> 39:58.497
* In the land
that's supposedly free *

39:58.530 --> 40:00.566
* Supposedly me...

40:08.940 --> 40:10.842
(door opens)

40:12.478 --> 40:14.513
(clears throat)

40:14.546 --> 40:17.583
Is everything okay?

40:17.616 --> 40:19.585
Yeah. Yes. I'm looking for a...

40:19.618 --> 40:21.453
bottle opener.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.723
Got it.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.159
Come back to bed, then.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.096
(exhales)

40:33.098 --> 40:35.501
So, uh...

40:35.534 --> 40:37.035
you and Gallo

40:37.068 --> 40:39.037
really weren't arguing
about anything?
No.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.573
No, one minute I was
just toasting Sergeant Hendrix,

40:41.607 --> 40:43.174
the next he was...

40:43.208 --> 40:46.111
Well, you saw him.
He was wasted.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.013
I don't know what's going on.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.582
He's been a mess
since the mission.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.752
People deal in different ways.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.254
Oh.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.657
I have good news.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.760
We got enough intel from Lavoy

41:01.793 --> 41:03.695
to keep D.C. happy.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.697
We're staying on Perseus.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.132
Thank God.

41:07.165 --> 41:08.934
It's official.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.101
So, what's the intel?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.637
You will be fully read in

41:11.670 --> 41:14.640
tomorrow.
Oh, come on.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.009
We're going after
Khalid's right-hand man.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.712
And get this--
he used to work for the CIA

41:20.746 --> 41:22.280
till Khalid turned him.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.550
What's his name?

41:24.583 --> 41:26.251
Davis Goundry.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.559
If we find him,

41:33.592 --> 41:37.195
Lavoy thinks that Goundry
can lead us to Jimmy.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.598
Any idea

41:39.631 --> 41:40.732
where Goundry is?

41:40.766 --> 41:43.001
Apparently he's on his way here.
