WEBVTT

00:03.334 --> 00:04.968
JJ: PREVIOUSLY
ON "CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:05.033 --> 00:06.767
THE BUREAU THINKS
THAT MY ABILITY 
TO LEAD THIS TEAM

00:06.834 --> 00:08.032
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.501
I'M RESIGNING AS UNIT CHIEF
AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

00:10.567 --> 00:12.334
WHAT?!
I'M NOT LEAVING THE TEAM.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.801
I'M JUST NO LONGER
IN CHARGE.

00:13.868 --> 00:15.667
YOU ARE.
ME?

00:15.734 --> 00:18.334
MS. BARNES, I'M SORRY FOR
YOUR BROTHER'S DEATH.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.467
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING PEOPLE SAY,

00:20.534 --> 00:23.400
BUT I TRULY AM SORRY.

00:23.467 --> 00:27.834
THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME
THROUGH THIS.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.801
OF COURSE.

00:30.868 --> 00:33.367
I THINK YOU NEED
TO CUT CONTACT
WITH TAMARA BARNES.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.200
PENELOPE, SHE LOST HER BROTHER.
SHE JUST WANTS ANSWERS.

00:35.267 --> 00:36.200
I'M NOT INVOLVED.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.601 --> 01:50.501
Man: LET'S GO.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.367
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

02:04.434 --> 02:05.367
WE ARE.

02:05.434 --> 02:07.100
IT'S 10 MINUTES
BEFORE CURFEW.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.533
I'LL GET YOU THERE.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.734
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH BEN?

02:30.801 --> 02:32.534
IT WAS JUST A PECK.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.133
ONLY BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T ALONE,
BUT NEXT TIME--

02:34.200 --> 02:35.801
[GASPS]

02:46.400 --> 02:48.367
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO
TEXT HIM TONIGHT?

02:48.434 --> 02:49.667
MAYBE.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.133
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.167
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE
HOMEWORK TO DO STILL.

02:53.234 --> 02:54.334
SO WHAT?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.667
I GUESS HE IS
PRETTY CUTE.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.100
UM, YEAH.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.434
MEGAN!

03:00.501 --> 03:01.801
NO! NO! PLEASE!

03:01.868 --> 03:03.934
STOP! STOP! AAH!

03:12.400 --> 03:14.968
I DON'T KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A PROMOTION TO ME.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.934
WELL, YEAH, IT--

03:17.000 --> 03:18.400
IT'S COMPLICATED.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.434
WHAT ISN'T?

03:19.501 --> 03:20.467
HMM.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.801
YEAH.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.601
IT'S JUST EVERYTHING'S
HAPPENED SO FAST,

03:23.667 --> 03:25.300
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T
EVEN HAD A CHANCE

03:25.367 --> 03:27.834
TO TELL THE REST
OF OUR TEAM YET.

03:27.901 --> 03:31.234
YOU KNOW, I WANTED
TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR...

03:31.300 --> 03:33.167
COMING TO THE HEARING.

03:33.234 --> 03:36.601
I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS
FAIR TO ASK YOU.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.000
TAMARA, I'M GLAD I COULD
BE THERE FOR YOU.

03:40.601 --> 03:44.334
I THINK THAT THE ONLY TIME
THAT I HAVE FELT SANE AT ALL

03:44.400 --> 03:48.267
IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS
IS WHEN I'VE TALKED TO YOU.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.467
REALLY? I...

03:50.534 --> 03:53.400
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN DOING
ALL THE TALKING HERE.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.367
YOU'VE HELPED ME
RECONNECT TO MY JOB.

03:56.434 --> 03:58.167
TO MYSELF, REALLY.

03:58.234 --> 04:00.567
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

04:00.634 --> 04:03.234
IT'S REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

04:04.801 --> 04:06.534
SO, LISTEN,

04:06.601 --> 04:09.701
I KNOW THAT YOUR NEW JOB
IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY

04:09.767 --> 04:12.601
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COMMIT A HUNDRED PERCENT,
AND YOU SHOULD.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.567
BUT MAYBE WHEN THINGS
CALM DOWN,

04:14.634 --> 04:16.466
I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK?
FAIR?

04:16.534 --> 04:19.000
YEAH. IT'S MORE THAN FAIR.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.667
ALSO, I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.868
IT WAS WILLIAM'S.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.200
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.100
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
PLEASE.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.567
FOR BEING THERE FOR ME.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.300
WHEN YOU LOSE A BROTHER
THE WAY THAT I DID,

04:38.367 --> 04:41.501
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU AT MY SIDE.

04:51.167 --> 04:54.767
SO, DID ANYONE EXPLAIN
WHY HOTCH IS STEPPING DOWN?

04:54.834 --> 04:58.634
ALL MORGAN SAID THIS MORNING
IS THAT IT'S HAPPENING.

04:58.701 --> 05:00.434
 AND IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.434
SO, WE'RE JUST
SUPPOSED TO MOVE FORWARD
WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSION?

05:03.501 --> 05:06.467
AFTER FOYET, I THINK
WE'D HAVE TO BE READY
FOR ANYTHING.

05:06.534 --> 05:07.901
Strauss:
DID YOU PICK A CASE?

05:07.968 --> 05:09.934
AGENT JAREAU AND I REVIEWED
THE REQUESTS THIS MORNING,

05:10.000 --> 05:11.934
AND I'VE DECIDED
ON OKLAHOMA CITY.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.434
WHY THIS ONE?

05:13.501 --> 05:15.701
LOCALS HAVE MORE
EVIDENTIARY INFORMATION
IN OTHER PRIORITIES.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.367
THIS ONE, THEY HAVE NOTHING.

05:17.434 --> 05:18.667
THEY NEED US THE MOST.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.200
GOOD.

05:20.267 --> 05:23.400
IF THAT'S ALL,
I'D LIKE TO GATHER THE TEAM.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.901
I'LL BE CHECKING IN.
I EXPECT TO BE BRIEFED.

05:25.968 --> 05:27.534
YES, MA'AM.

05:27.601 --> 05:29.267
IF YOU NEED PRIVACY,
PLEASE USE MY OFFICE.

05:29.334 --> 05:30.701
THAT'S OK. WE'RE DONE HERE.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.067
AND WHEN WE GET BACK,
I'LL CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT

05:32.133 --> 05:33.133
AND IT'LL BE ALL YOURS.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.767
HOTCH, I DON'T WANT
YOUR OFFICE.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.334
 I AGREE WITH AGENT HOTCHNER.
 THE TEAM LEADER NEEDS
 A PROPER OFFICE.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.667
ALL DUE RESPECT,
MS. STRAUSS,

05:38.734 --> 05:39.901
BUT BOTH OF YOU
HAVE TRUSTED ME

05:39.968 --> 05:41.133
TO STEP IN
AS ACTING UNIT CHIEF.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.000
I'M ASKING THAT YOU
RESPECT MY DECISION.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.501
I'VE DECIDED THAT
I DON'T WANT HOTCH'S OFFICE.

05:44.567 --> 05:45.767
THAT'S WHERE HE BELONGS.

05:45.834 --> 05:48.167
IF NECESSARY, WE CAN DISCUSS
THIS AGAIN AT A LATER DATE,

05:48.234 --> 05:51.267
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY
NEED TO GET STARTED
ON THIS CASE.

05:51.334 --> 05:52.467
GUYS.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.067
GRAB ROSSI.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.667
THIS IS MEGAN CHERTOW
AND HER FRIEND
BINA SUKARTO,

05:56.734 --> 06:00.334
BOTH 17, FOUND 2 NIGHTS AGO
IN A PARKING GARAGE,

06:00.400 --> 06:02.000
CAROTIDS SEVERED.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.834
THIS IS JOHN O'HERON, 61.

06:03.901 --> 06:06.300
HE WAS FOUND DEAD
IN A WOODED AREA 4 DAYS AGO,

06:06.367 --> 06:08.267
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

06:08.334 --> 06:09.734
DIFFERENT M.O.

06:09.801 --> 06:11.133
AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
VICTIMOLOGY.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.534
Rossi: HOW ARE
THE CASES LINKED?

06:12.601 --> 06:14.234
JJ: THEIR EYES
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.534
OH, HE'S AN ENUCLEATOR.

06:15.601 --> 06:16.734
THERE'S A NAME FOR THIS?

06:16.801 --> 06:19.033
IT'S A RARE SUBSET
OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR,

06:19.100 --> 06:21.801
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN
CASE STUDIES OF
ASSAULTIVE ENUCLEATORS.

06:21.868 --> 06:25.467
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
OF THEM SUFFER FROM
DIAGNOSED MENTAL DISORDERS.

06:25.534 --> 06:26.834
Reid: AND THEY'RE
USUALLY MALES,

06:26.901 --> 06:27.934
LACK SOCIAL SKILLS,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.367
THEIR KILLS ARE
DISORGANIZED AND SLOPPY.

06:29.434 --> 06:31.601
THE TYPICAL ENUCLEATOR
GOUGES THE EYES OUT,

06:31.667 --> 06:33.400
BUT HE DOESN'T NORMALLY
TAKE THEM WITH HIM.

06:33.467 --> 06:34.467
THIS GUY DID?

06:34.534 --> 06:36.067
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.567
THERE ARE
NOTICEABLE SHIFTS

06:37.634 --> 06:39.133
FROM THE FIRST
TO SECOND MURDER.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.767
HE GOES FROM KILLING
IN SECLUSION

06:40.834 --> 06:42.100
TO A PUBLIC PLACE.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.834
AND HE ESCALATED
FROM ONE VICTIM TO 2.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.601
WHAT CONCERNS ME MOST IS
THERE'S LESS THAN 48 HOURS

06:46.667 --> 06:49.067
BETWEEN THE MURDERS.
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE
THIS CASE.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.467
Hotch: AND FROM WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT ENUCLEATORS,

06:51.534 --> 06:53.567
THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS
MULTIPLE REPEAT OFFENDERS.

06:53.634 --> 06:55.467
EXACTLY. WHICH MEANS
HE'S GOING TO NEED
TO KILL AGAIN SOON.

06:55.534 --> 06:58.701
ALL RIGHT. LET'S MEET
ON THE PLANE IN 30.

07:14.701 --> 07:15.767
AAH!

07:15.834 --> 07:16.834
AAH!

07:52.534 --> 07:54.567
Morgan: "AND IF THY RIGHT EYE
OFFEND THEE,

07:54.634 --> 07:57.100
PLUCK IT OUT
AND CAST IT FROM THEE."

07:57.167 --> 07:59.901
MATTHEW 5:29.

07:59.968 --> 08:02.667
THE COLOR OF ALL THE VICTIMS'
EYES ARE DIFFERENT,

08:02.734 --> 08:04.434
SO THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T
FACTOR IN TO VICTIMOLOGY.

08:04.501 --> 08:06.234
IT'S MORE LIKELY WHAT
HE SEES IN THE EYES.

08:06.300 --> 08:07.701
CASE STUDIES SHOW
THAT MOST ENUCLEATORS

08:07.767 --> 08:09.100
SUFFER FROM DELUSIONS.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.067
THEY HEAR VOICES
AND SEE THINGS
IN PEOPLE'S EYES.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.467
USUALLY SOMETHING EVIL.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.934
THEY'RE DRIVEN TO ENUCLEATE
TO DESTROY THE DEVIL.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.868
IT POINTS TO SOMEONE WHO MAY
HAVE BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED

08:16.934 --> 08:18.033
AND RECENTLY RELEASED.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.400
I'LL HAVE GARCIA
START LOOKING.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.300
ALL RIGHT, SO TALK TO ME.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.100
WHAT MAKES THESE ATTACKS
SO DIFFERENT?

08:23.167 --> 08:25.601
WITH VICTIM ONE, THERE WERE
MULTIPLE BLUNT FORCE STRIKES
TO THE HEAD--

08:25.667 --> 08:26.934
A MORE PERSONAL KILL.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.400
AND HE DISPOSED OF THE BODY,

08:28.467 --> 08:30.300
MAYBE AS A FORENSIC
COUNTERMEASURE.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.299
THE NEXT MURDERS SEEMED
LESS PERSONAL,

08:32.366 --> 08:33.501
MORE OPPORTUNISTIC.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.967
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK
AT WHY THE FIRST VICTIM

08:35.033 --> 08:36.133
WAS BLUDGEONED AND DUMPED.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.200
PERHAPS THE UNSUB
KNEW HIM.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.701
PRENTISS, I WANT YOU TO GO
TO THE DISPOSAL SITE,

08:40.767 --> 08:42.833
 SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
 WHY HE WAS DUMPED THERE.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.834
ROSSI, YOU AND I ARE
GONNA GO TO LAST NIGHT'S
CRIME SCENE.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.701
ACTUALLY, UH,
THE GIRLS' FAMILIES

08:47.767 --> 08:49.834
ASKED TO SPEAK
TO OUR TEAM LEADER.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.167
ALL RIGHT. UM...

08:56.234 --> 08:59.334
OK, IN THAT CASE,
ROSSI, YOU CAN HANDLE
THE CRIME SCENE SOLO.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.534
JJ, YOU'RE WITH ME,

09:01.601 --> 09:02.801
AND, HOTCH, REID,

09:02.868 --> 09:04.601
I WANT YOU TO GET INTO
JOHN O'HERON'S LIFE,

09:04.667 --> 09:07.901
SEE IF ANYTHING AT ALL
POINTS TO A PERSONAL MOTIVE.

09:12.367 --> 09:13.801
HEY. PHIL BRANTLEY.
APPRECIATE Y'ALL COMING.

09:13.868 --> 09:15.567
AGENT HOTCHNER.
THIS IS DR. REID.

09:15.634 --> 09:17.100
YOU'LL MEET THE REST
OF THE TEAM LATER.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.300
EXCELLENT.
EXCELLENT.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.033
OK, HERE'S WHERE
THE FIRST BODY
WAS FOUND,

09:20.100 --> 09:21.367
JUST OUTSIDE
OF TOWN.

09:21.434 --> 09:23.501
AND LAST NIGHT'S
MURDERS WERE HERE.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.667
 AND THAT'S ABOUT
 22 MILES APART.

09:25.734 --> 09:27.901
THAT'S UNUSUAL.
WHAT?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.667
SERIAL KILLERS USUALLY HAVE
A SMALLER KILL ZONE.

09:29.734 --> 09:31.367
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

09:31.434 --> 09:33.133
IT'S OUR TECHNICAL ANALYST.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.767
HEY, GARCIA,
YOU'RE ON SPEAKERPHONE.

09:34.834 --> 09:38.934
SO, I LOOKED UP
RECENTLY RELEASED
MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS

09:39.000 --> 09:41.100
WHO HAVE A HISTORY
OF EYE GOUGING,

09:41.167 --> 09:43.033
EYE ASSAULT,
AND OTHER GROSS THINGS

09:43.100 --> 09:45.400
 YOU CAN DO TO EYES
 AND SOCKETS.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.767
AND THERE'S NO BINGO
FOR OKIE CITY RESIDENTS.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.501
ANY OTHER RECENT ATTACKS
INVOLVING ASSAULTS ON EYES?

09:50.567 --> 09:53.400
THERE'S ONE 9 MONTHS AGO.
HE'S NOT YOUR GUY,
'CAUSE HE'S IN JAIL.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.667
WE'LL CALL YOU LATER.

09:54.734 --> 09:55.934
10-4, BREAKER BREAKER.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.234
BYE.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.767
YOU THINK HE'S FRESH OUT
OF AN ASYLUM?

09:58.834 --> 10:01.133
EITHER THAT OR HE'S BEEN HELD
SOMEWHERE AND HE'S NOW FREE.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.601
WE'VE SEEN EYE ASSAULTS
BEFORE,

10:02.667 --> 10:05.400
YOU KNOW, BAR BRAWLS, RAPES,
DOMESTIC ABUSE CASES.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.167
BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.

10:07.234 --> 10:09.133
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING WITH THE EYES?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.501
HE COULD BE COLLECTING THEM
AS A TROPHY OF SOME SORT.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.434
Reid: THEY WOULDN'T
KEEP LONG AS TROPHIES.

10:13.501 --> 10:15.133
EYES ARE 80% VITREOUS HUMOR,

10:15.200 --> 10:16.701
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WATER.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.968
AFTER A FEW HOURS, THEY BEGIN
TO GET CLOUDY AND WILT.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.534
ANY OTHER THEORIES?

10:20.601 --> 10:22.367
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES
WHERE AFTER ENUCLEATION,

10:22.434 --> 10:25.467
MENTAL PATIENTS
HAVE CONSUMED THE EYEBALLS.

10:25.534 --> 10:27.701
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:52.934 --> 10:54.868
THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE.

10:54.934 --> 10:56.267
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

10:56.334 --> 10:57.868
WE CAN'T LEAVE OUR HOUSE.

10:57.934 --> 10:59.467
WE HAVE TO MOURN FOR 3 DAYS.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.300
BUDDHIST RITUALS?

11:01.367 --> 11:03.133
YES.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.634
DID YOUR SISTER CALL YOU

11:04.701 --> 11:06.467
WHILE SHE WAS OUT
LAST NIGHT?

11:06.534 --> 11:08.100
NO. I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.467
SHE ALWAYS COMES HOME
BY CURFEW.

11:10.534 --> 11:13.100
DOES THIS MAN LOOK
FAMILIAR TO YOU?

11:13.167 --> 11:14.834
NO.

11:14.901 --> 11:16.300
WHY DO YOU ASK?

11:16.367 --> 11:17.801
WE BELIEVE
HE AND YOUR SISTER

11:17.868 --> 11:19.367
WERE KILLED
BY THE SAME PERSON.

11:19.434 --> 11:21.834
IT HELPS US TO RULE OUT
ANY CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS,

11:21.901 --> 11:23.868
AND IT TELLS US
THAT YOUR SISTER
WAS MOST LIKELY

11:23.934 --> 11:25.267
ATTACKED AT RANDOM.

11:27.567 --> 11:30.033
OH, THANK YOU.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.467
THANK YOU.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.067
I ASKED TO SPEAK TO YOU

11:35.133 --> 11:37.567
BECAUSE WE NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR US.

11:44.868 --> 11:46.801
[TAKES BREATH] MM.

11:46.868 --> 11:48.334
IT'S OK.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.467
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:52.434 --> 11:55.467
GRANDMA SAID SHE SAW
BINA'S GHOST LAST NIGHT.

11:57.868 --> 12:01.601
HER EYES WERE JUST
BIG BLACK HOLES.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.501
BINA WAS LOOKING
FOR HER EYES.

12:10.434 --> 12:12.701
SHE SAYS BINA'S CURSED.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.567
SHE CAN'T REST.

12:17.634 --> 12:19.801
SHE'S STUCK FOR ETERNITY

12:19.868 --> 12:22.601
LOOKING FOR HER EYES.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.901
WE WANT TO CREMATE HER.

12:25.968 --> 12:28.834
 BUT WE NEED ALL OF HER.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.467
CAN YOU FIND HER EYES
FOR US?

12:35.534 --> 12:38.501
WE WILL TRY.

12:38.567 --> 12:41.367
BUT REALISTICALLY,
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.267
THEN SHE WILL BE CURSED
FOREVER.

12:50.167 --> 12:53.801
SHE MAY NEVER REST IN PEACE.

12:59.634 --> 13:02.467
O'HERON'S FRIENDS SAY
HE HAS A HISTORY
OF DRUNKEN BEHAVIOR,

13:02.534 --> 13:04.734
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM.

13:04.801 --> 13:06.100
HE WAS LAST SEEN
LEAVING A BAR.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.801
BARTENDER ON DUTY SAID
HE LEFT WITHOUT INCIDENT.

13:07.868 --> 13:09.501
WHERE DID HE GO
AFTER THAT?

13:09.567 --> 13:10.868
I CHECKED OUT
THE DISPOSAL SITE

13:10.934 --> 13:12.334
WHERE JOHN O'HERON'S BODY
WAS DUMPED.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.667
IT'S A REMOTE FARM ROAD.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.801
THE UNSUB DIDN'T JUST
STUMBLE ON IT. HE KNOWS IT.

13:15.868 --> 13:18.000
WE NEED A LIST OF PEOPLE
WHO WORK OR LIVE
NEAR THE AREA.

13:18.067 --> 13:20.234
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS GUY.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.434
WHY IS THAT?

13:21.501 --> 13:22.934
HE CHOSE
THAT PARKING GARAGE.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.133
HE WAS PATIENT.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.801
HE HID AND WAITED
FOR THE RIGHT VICTIMS

13:25.868 --> 13:27.434
AND THE RIGHT TIME
AND PLACE.

13:27.501 --> 13:28.634
HE BLITZED THEM.

13:28.701 --> 13:30.601
IT WAS ALL STRATEGIC.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.534
THAT SOUNDS WAY TOO ORGANIZED
FOR A TYPICAL ENUCLEATOR.

13:33.601 --> 13:35.968
ADD TO THAT HIS LACK
OF A COOLING-OFF PERIOD
BETWEEN KILLS,

13:36.033 --> 13:37.634
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
TO GET AHEAD OF HIM.

13:37.701 --> 13:39.734
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE M.E.

13:39.801 --> 13:41.901
SHE SAYS THERE'S
SOMETHING WE SHOULD SEE.

13:41.968 --> 13:43.701
THE EYEBALL IS HELD
IN THE SOCKET

13:43.767 --> 13:45.701
BY 6 DIFFERENT MUSCLES,
FATTY TISSUE,

13:45.767 --> 13:47.334
AND THE OPTIC NERVES.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.934
THESE ARE PICTURES OF
JOHN O'HERON'S EYE SOCKETS.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.801
SEE THE OPTIC NERVES
PROTRUDING?

13:51.868 --> 13:53.334
TRAUMA. THEY WERE RIPPED OUT.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.934
MAYBE WITH FINGERS.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.434
NOW COMPARE THIS
TO MY BODY ON THE TABLE.

13:57.501 --> 14:01.133
SMOOTH INSIDE, NO BRUISING,
NO SIGN OF TRAUMA.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.133
OPTIC NERVES RETRACTED
INTO THE MUSCLE

14:04.200 --> 14:05.968
AND THEY HAVE
A CLEAN EDGE.

14:06.033 --> 14:08.200
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
THESE WERE CUT OUT.

14:08.267 --> 14:09.801
WITH A SHARP-EDGED TOOL.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.701
HE MANAGED TO AVOID
CUTTING THE SOCKETS

14:11.767 --> 14:12.868
OR THE EYELIDS.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.634
THIS WAS PRECISE WORK.

14:14.701 --> 14:17.033
THE KIND OF WORK
ONLY A DOCTOR COULD DO?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.467
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
WITH BOTH OF THESE GIRLS,

14:19.534 --> 14:21.334
IT WAS A CLEAN EXCISION.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.767
OK, SO HE WAS CRUDE
WITH THE FIRST VICTIM,

14:24.834 --> 14:26.300
SURGICAL WITH THE OTHERS.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.968
THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT
HE'S GOING THROUGH

14:28.033 --> 14:31.033
 TO REMOVE THE EYES NOW,
 HE WOULDN'T DESTROY THEM.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.200
HE'S KEEPING THEM.

14:59.801 --> 15:02.367
[PANTING]

15:04.467 --> 15:06.400
[RUSTLING]

15:19.133 --> 15:20.234
OHH!

15:47.934 --> 15:50.801
IT'S SECLUDED, BUT HE
CHOSE A PUBLIC SPOT AGAIN.

15:50.868 --> 15:53.200
HE'S NOT AFRAID
TO GET CAUGHT.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.200
THIS IS FAR FROM
THE OTHER CRIME SCENES.

15:55.267 --> 15:56.534
WHAT BROUGHT HIM HERE?

15:56.601 --> 15:59.234
WELL, HE ONLY KILLED
ONE PERSON THIS TIME.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.868
IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE.

16:00.934 --> 16:02.234
HEY, WE FOUND A CAR
PARKED NEARBY.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.701
I.D.'d HER FROM
A DMV PHOTO.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.901
TRACY COPPER, 32.
HUSBAND SAID SHE WAS
AN AVID JOGGER.

16:06.968 --> 16:08.801
SINGLE KNIFE WOUND
TO THE NECK,
EYES ARE MISSING.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.734
CUT OUT AS CAREFULLY
AS THE LAST ONES.

16:14.033 --> 16:16.601
HEY, GARCIA. SO, WE HAVE
THE LIST OF LOCAL DOCTORS,

16:16.667 --> 16:18.534
BUT WE NEED TO BACK IT UP
ONE STEP.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.267
WHERE SHALL I SPLICE,
MY PRETTIES?

16:20.334 --> 16:21.934
GIVE ME A LIST
OF ALL DOCTORS

16:22.000 --> 16:24.534
WHO'VE HAD INFRACTIONS
LIKE MALPRACTICE SUITS.

16:24.601 --> 16:25.934
GOT IT. BOUNCING YOUR WAY.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.501
NARROW IT DOWN
TO EYE SPECIALISTS.

16:27.567 --> 16:28.834
WHOO, THAT'S STILL
A LOT OF NAMES.

16:28.901 --> 16:30.234
WE'LL CHIP AWAY
WHEN WE KNOW MORE.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.434
HEY, WAIT.
BEFORE YOU HANG UP,

16:31.501 --> 16:32.834
HOW'S MY MORGAN DOING?

16:32.901 --> 16:33.934
FINE.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.167
I KNOW THE MAN IS FINE.

16:35.234 --> 16:37.267
HOW'S HE HOLDING UP
AS HEAD HONCHO?

16:37.334 --> 16:39.901
WELL, HE'S STRESSED,
BUT HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

16:39.968 --> 16:41.467
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.934
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO FOR HIM.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.267
NAME IT.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.334
HE MUST HAVE HIDDEN
IN THESE TREES
LYING IN WAIT AGAIN.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.100
SO, HE PICKED HIS LOCATION
AND THEN WAITED FOR
A VICTIM OF OPPORTUNITY.

16:54.167 --> 16:57.367
 HE BLITZES HER BECAUSE
 HE LACKS THE SOCIAL
 SKILLS TO CHARM.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.901
THAT FEELS LIKE
THE SAME PATTERN

16:58.968 --> 17:00.400
AS THE GIRLS
IN THE PARKING LOT.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.267
BUT HE WAS QUIET
IN THE PARKING LOT.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.334
IF HE HID IN THESE TREES,
THERE'S TOO MUCH DRY BRUSH.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.934
HE WOULD HAVE MADE NOISE.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.400
NO, IT'S TOO SLOPPY FOR HIM.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.067
SHE WAS A SERIOUS JOGGER.
IF SHE'D HEARD HIM,

17:09.133 --> 17:11.400
 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE
 TO OUTRUN HIM.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.534
UNLESS HE SURPRISED HER
SOME OTHER WAY.

17:13.601 --> 17:15.067
GUYS.

17:15.133 --> 17:16.467
WHAT IS THAT?

17:16.534 --> 17:18.200
TRIPWIRE?

17:18.267 --> 17:20.367
WE NEED TO LOOK
AT HER ANKLES.

17:24.834 --> 17:27.367
HE USED THE TRIPWIRE
TO GET HER OFF HER FEET.

17:27.434 --> 17:29.467
SHE'S STUNNED
AND SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TIME TO RUN AWAY.

17:29.534 --> 17:31.334
HE LAID A TRAP FOR HER.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.534
ALL THIS, PLUS THE WAY
HE BLEEDS HER AT THE NECK.

17:34.601 --> 17:37.267
IT'S THE BEHAVIOR
OF A GAME HUNTER.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.334
HUNTING'S A BIG PART
OF THIS CITY'S CULTURE.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.167
YEAH, HUNTING ANIMALS IS.

17:53.234 --> 17:55.100
WHAT TRIGGERED HIM
TO START HUNTING HUMANS?

17:55.167 --> 17:57.534
THIS GUY IS TAKING
PEOPLE'S EYES,

17:57.601 --> 17:59.534
SO HE'S DEFINITELY
DISTURBED.

17:59.601 --> 18:01.868
WHAT BUGS ME IS THAT
PEOPLE LIKE THIS

18:01.934 --> 18:04.701
USUALLY UNRAVEL,
GET SLOPPY.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.801
AND THIS GUY'S
ONLY GETTING BETTER.

18:07.968 --> 18:09.267
THEY'RE BACK.

18:11.701 --> 18:14.367
MORGAN, I'M FIELDING CALLS
LEFT AND RIGHT HERE.

18:14.434 --> 18:16.300
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
CASE MADE NATIONAL NEWS.

18:16.367 --> 18:19.167
THEY'RE STARTING TO CALL
HIM THE EYE SNATCHER.

18:19.234 --> 18:21.000
ALL RIGHT, UM,

18:21.067 --> 18:23.234
YOU'RE GONNA HOLD A SMALL,
CONTROLLED PRESS CONFERENCE.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.267
ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS,
BUT TRY TO SQUASH THAT NAME.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.334
I WANT THE PEOPLE TO BE AWARE,
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
A BOGEYMAN OUT OF THIS GUY.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

18:29.467 --> 18:30.567
YEAH. YEAH.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.067
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

18:32.133 --> 18:34.200
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
STRAUSS' CALLS.

18:34.267 --> 18:37.334
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO KEEP TABS. SHE CAN WAIT.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.467
MORGAN, I THINK
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TIME
TO FIELD THE CALL.

18:40.534 --> 18:42.767
HOTCH, WE HAVE TO SET UP
A TIP LINE.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.567
WE HAVE TO GO OVER
JJ's TALKING POINTS.

18:44.634 --> 18:46.367
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THE PROFILE OUT YET.

18:46.434 --> 18:48.567
ALL OF THAT TAKES PRIORITY
OVER DEALING WITH STRAUSS.

18:48.634 --> 18:49.934
I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.968
LET US HELP YOU
SET UP STRATEGY
WHILE YOU TALK TO HER.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.968
WE'LL REGROUP WITH YOU
BEFORE WE PROCEED.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.968
WE HAVE ENOUGH BATTLES.
BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT HER, TOO.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.534
LET ME GET THIS PROFILE OUT,

18:58.601 --> 19:00.434
AND THEN I'LL GO TALK
TO STRAUSS.

19:04.868 --> 19:06.434
HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB.

19:06.501 --> 19:07.901
HE IS.

19:07.968 --> 19:09.901
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
HOW THIS IS GOING TO END?

19:09.968 --> 19:11.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:12.067 --> 19:15.634
MORGAN AS OUR UNIT CHIEF
IS A TEMPORARY THING.

19:15.701 --> 19:17.567
IT IS.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.934
HE'S A NATURAL LEADER.
HE'LL EXCEL.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.968
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
HE'S ASKED TO STEP DOWN?

19:26.901 --> 19:28.567
[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]

20:01.334 --> 20:02.934
WE BELIEVE THAT OUR UNSUB

20:03.000 --> 20:04.767
MAY HAVE KNOWN
HIS FIRST VICTIM,

20:04.834 --> 20:06.601
YET THE REST WERE RANDOM.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.000
MOST ENUCLEATORS
HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER

20:09.067 --> 20:11.801
AND ARE FRENZIED AND SLOPPY
WHEN THEY ATTACK.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.767
THIS ONE HAS MORE CONTROL.

20:13.834 --> 20:16.434
WE ARE NOT CALLING HIM
BY ANY NICKNAME.

20:16.501 --> 20:19.801
HE IS SIMPLY A MURDERER
THAT THE FBI IS TRYING
TO APPREHEND.

20:19.868 --> 20:22.133
HE LAYS IN WAIT
TO KILL HIS VICTIMS,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.300
KNOWS HOW TO CUT THEM
SO THEY BLEED OUT.

20:24.367 --> 20:27.367
THIS INDICATES HE MIGHT
HAVE A HUNTING BACKGROUND.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.267
WE'RE URGING CITIZENS
TO BE HYPERVIGILANT
AT NIGHT.

20:30.334 --> 20:33.667
HE IS KILLING IN DIFFERENT
AREAS OF THE CITY

20:33.734 --> 20:35.334
IN PUBLIC PLACES.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.300
HIS LARGE KILL ZONE
COULD BE RELATED

20:37.367 --> 20:39.367
TO SOME TYPE
OF TRAVEL PATTERN
IN HIS LIFE,

20:39.434 --> 20:41.334
WHICH INDICATES A COMFORT
WITH THESE NEIGHBORHOODS.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.667
WHY, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IS HE KILLING PEOPLE
EVERY DAY?

20:43.734 --> 20:45.400
THE ESCALATION
MIGHT BE CAUSED

20:45.467 --> 20:47.734
BY A SELF-IMPOSED
TIME LINE.

20:47.801 --> 20:50.467
HE HAS TO MURDER
SO MANY PEOPLE,

20:50.534 --> 20:53.167
TAKE THIS MANY EYES,
TO ACCOMPLISH A TASK.

20:53.234 --> 20:56.067
SO, HE'S CRAZY,
BUT HE'S GOT A MISSION?

20:56.133 --> 20:57.234
ACTUALLY, YES.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.901
HE'S ACTING
ON A DELUSION

20:58.968 --> 21:00.868
THAT'S FUELING
THIS MURDER SPREE.

21:00.934 --> 21:01.901
FOR EXAMPLE,

21:01.968 --> 21:03.434
A MAN NAMED HERBERT MULLIN.

21:03.501 --> 21:06.434
HE HAD A FEAR OF A CATASTROPHIC
EARTHQUAKE HITTING CALIFORNIA.

21:06.501 --> 21:08.667
NOW, HE BELIEVED
THAT BY KILLING PEOPLE

21:08.734 --> 21:11.334
AND OFFERING THEIR BLOOD
AS A SACRIFICE TO THE EARTH,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.400
HE COULD PREVENT
AN EARTHQUAKE.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.000
 HE WAS A PARANOID
 SCHIZOPHRENIC,

21:15.067 --> 21:16.934
AND HIS DELUSION LED HIM
TO KILL 13 PEOPLE.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.734
UH, WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR
WHEN WE'RE ON THE STREETS?

21:18.801 --> 21:21.801
WE BELIEVE HE'S
A WHITE MALE, 27 TO 35.

21:21.868 --> 21:24.701
WE BELIEVE HE IS DRIVING
A VAN OR A PICKUP TRUCK

21:24.767 --> 21:26.234
WITH A REMOVABLE CAB.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.434
SOMETHING UTILITARIAN
THAT CAN GET BLOODY
AND WASH OUT EASILY.

21:29.501 --> 21:31.701
HE MAY ALSO HAVE APPLIED
FOR HUNTING LICENSES.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.634
HE HAS SOME SORT OF MEDICAL
OR SURGICAL TRAINING

21:34.701 --> 21:37.601
BUT FELL SHORT OF MAKING
A CAREER OUT OF IT.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.467
JJ: HE MAY HAVE BEEN
IN A HALFWAY HOUSE

21:39.534 --> 21:42.133
OR HAVE BEEN GRANTED LEAVE
FROM A TREATMENT FACILITY.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.467
MAYBE HIS FAMILY MOVED HIM
AWAY AND NOW HE'S BACK.

21:44.534 --> 21:47.467

UNTIL HE CAN BE ALONE

UNDERSTAND HOW BUSY WE WERE.
