WEBVTT

00:50.092 --> 00:51.135
Shh!

01:34.428 --> 01:37.932
One Dog Night and Creedence Shaggy
are rocking tonight!

01:38.140 --> 01:44.146
Listen, don't wear yourselves out
before we get to the rock festival!

01:47.233 --> 01:48.776
Groovy, guys! Really!

01:50.444 --> 01:54.532
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

01:55.491 --> 02:00.997
I wish I could find a groovy
road sign to tell us where we are!

02:02.331 --> 02:03.874
There's some kind of sign!

02:04.041 --> 02:06.961
I hope it's not an ad
for shaving cream!

02:07.128 --> 02:10.298
- Let's have a look!
- Right!

02:10.798 --> 02:14.218
- Well, that's a big help!
- I wonder what it says.

02:14.427 --> 02:20.016
It says, "24,000 miles to China!
Thataway!"

02:20.433 --> 02:24.603
Be serious! We could be in
trouble if we don't know where we are!

02:25.146 --> 02:28.316
I think we're in trouble already!
Look!

02:29.608 --> 02:31.986
- Yipes!
- And double yipes!

02:34.822 --> 02:38.159
- What's that?
- Yeah! What?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.661
It's a guy with a lantern, silly.

02:40.828 --> 02:45.166
- Excuse me, sir, but-
- Name's Asa Shanks. Why are you here?

02:45.333 --> 02:49.462
Nice to meet you. We're on our way
to a music festival.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.631
You better be on your way,
quick as possible!

02:52.840 --> 02:56.302
- That's it, sir, I think we're lost.
- Lost?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.429
Cool it, Scoob, it'll be okay.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.599
Could you direct us to
Interstate <i>5</i> please?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.851
Straight ahead to the fork.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.021
Which way do we go
at the fork in the road?

03:07.188 --> 03:11.108
Left fork is the long way around,
right fork's the short.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.570
- Good, we'll take the right!
- Right! Right!

03:14.862 --> 03:16.947
I'd go the long way if I were you.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.867
But you said the right way's
the short way!

03:20.034 --> 03:23.537
Also takes you past the
haunted mansion!

03:23.871 --> 03:25.873
Haunted mansion?

03:27.458 --> 03:29.543
And the Headless Specter!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.587
Headless?

03:32.963 --> 03:37.301
- What do you mean, "Headless Specter"?
- Yes, who is it?

03:37.468 --> 03:42.223
Ain't no one never met the
Headless Specter and lived to tell it!

03:47.978 --> 03:51.232
- He's disappeared!
- That's the best idea I've heard!

03:51.440 --> 03:54.318
- What idea?
- Let us disappear!

03:54.610 --> 03:55.986
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:59.115 --> 04:02.910
There's the fork in the road,
just like our friend said.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.997
What's it to be, gang?
The short right way or the long left way?

04:07.415 --> 04:08.499
Right!

04:08.666 --> 04:09.792
- The left!
- The left!

04:10.668 --> 04:12.670
It seems we have a tie vote!

04:13.087 --> 04:16.132
- Let's flip a bologna slice to decide!
- What?

04:16.340 --> 04:19.760
Heads, right, and I eat it!
Tails, left, and I eat it!

04:19.927 --> 04:23.431
How can you have heads and tails
on a slice of bologna?

04:23.597 --> 04:27.101
Heads is the mustard side,
tails is plain.

04:27.268 --> 04:31.355
Of all the ridiculous... Oh, all right!

04:42.450 --> 04:46.120
Scooby ate our last piece
of bologna. Now which way?

04:46.287 --> 04:50.124
We go the short route.
We're low on gas!

04:52.251 --> 04:54.795
Haunted mansion, here we come!

05:02.178 --> 05:04.263
Wow, is this car overheating!

05:04.472 --> 05:07.141
Like, I thought we had a built-in
steam room!

05:07.308 --> 05:08.976
Me too!

05:09.602 --> 05:13.439
Shag and Scoob! How about finding
water for the van?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.025
Where are we going to find water?

05:16.233 --> 05:19.445
- I saw a well over by the house.
- Gotcha!

05:20.529 --> 05:22.865
- Ain't seen any haunts yet!
- Nope.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.159
And let's keep it that way!

05:31.582 --> 05:33.876
- Was that you, I hope?
- Uh-uh.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.468
- Yipes!
- And triple yipes!

05:50.518 --> 05:52.853
What happened? Where's the water?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.480
Ghosts!

05:54.855 --> 05:57.441
- Ghosts! Where?
- Back there!

05:57.608 --> 06:00.361
Let's have a look at those ghosts!

06:01.320 --> 06:02.947
Ghosts! Ghosts!

06:03.197 --> 06:07.576
We might have known.
A Scooby ghost, that's all it is!

06:07.826 --> 06:10.204
But I tell you...!

06:10.371 --> 06:14.667
Shaggy, the nonmaterial embodiment,
or essence or organism...

06:14.875 --> 06:18.671
that's seen as a specter,
wraith or apparition...

06:18.879 --> 06:22.299
has been scientifically
proven to be a sheer myth.

06:22.466 --> 06:27.846
- In other words, ghosts don't exist!
- Yeah, but does the ghost know that?

06:28.305 --> 06:32.309
- We have a problem, friends. No bucket!
- No bucket, no water.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.896
Look, guys! There's a light in that
old haunted mansion!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.065
That's our cue to light out of here!

06:38.232 --> 06:39.733
And now!

06:39.900 --> 06:42.236
Just hold it a minute, you two.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.698
- It's probably the Headless Specter!
- Or a ghost!

06:46.282 --> 06:49.577
Like your ghost in the well, Scooby?

06:50.286 --> 06:52.955
We need water for the Mystery Machine.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.583
- Let's go borrow a bucket.
- Right.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.168
A light means people, I hope.

07:15.728 --> 07:18.230
Somebody's here!
Look, there's a candle!

07:18.397 --> 07:23.611
- Bet it's ghosts again, or worse!
- Ghosts don't need candles.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.404
Oh, no? Look!

07:27.406 --> 07:30.075
Oh, no! A floating candle!

07:30.534 --> 07:32.161
Ghosts!

07:41.712 --> 07:45.174
Wow! What a spooky old room!

07:45.674 --> 07:48.093
Hey! I wonder who this guy is.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.554
"Jefferson Stillwall."

07:50.763 --> 07:54.016
He must have owned this old place
at one time.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.518
I wonder what he's pointing at.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.481
Where's his head?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.777
Oh, my gosh! I don't believe it!

08:05.569 --> 08:08.614
Look at that picture, you guys!

08:08.781 --> 08:11.450
What? It's a picture of a guy
pointing.

08:11.617 --> 08:15.621
- A minute ago, the head was missing!
- Yeah! Yeah!

08:20.000 --> 08:24.963
I think we've stumbled onto some kind
of kooky mystery. Let's look around.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.803
- Maybe it's us!
- Yeah.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.473
Yipes! It did it again!

08:36.809 --> 08:38.686
Shh.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.398
It seems to be coming from that
direction!

08:56.829 --> 08:59.748
I thought we came here to
borrow a bucket.

08:59.957 --> 09:04.044
- Don't you sense a mystery?
- I sure do. Like, why are we here?

09:05.421 --> 09:06.505
There it goes again.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.466
- And here we go again!
- Wait, Shag!

09:09.633 --> 09:14.054
Seems like the sounds are coming
from behind that door.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.477
It's empty. Let's go.

09:20.686 --> 09:25.649
- No, it isn't! Look!
- Now, there's a clue. Come on!

09:26.525 --> 09:28.527
Well, who wants to do the honors?

09:30.738 --> 09:34.491
A volunteer! Good boy, Scooby!

09:34.658 --> 09:39.747
Good boy! You're our hero!
Hooray for Scooby!

09:42.374 --> 09:47.713
Now, there's nothing wrong with your
paw, Scooby. Just open the box.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.717
It's Jefferson Stillwall!

09:53.218 --> 09:57.556
- It's only a wooden dummy.
- Somebody wanted to scare us!

09:57.723 --> 10:00.058
And they did a good job too.

10:00.225 --> 10:04.062
A Scooby Snack will bring him around.
Scooby?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.568
He's going to be difficult, I see!

10:13.405 --> 10:15.908
That face-in-the-box doesn't scare me.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.870
I know, but we still need a clue
as to what's going on.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.622
A clue! A clue!

10:21.830 --> 10:24.750
- Hey, Scooby's found a clue!
- Footprints!

10:24.958 --> 10:26.251
Let's follow them.

10:26.418 --> 10:30.130
You guys go ahead.
We'll stay with old face-in-the-box!

10:30.339 --> 10:35.969
- Aren't you curious?
- Not a bit. Scared, yes. Curious, no.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.429
Come on, Shaggy!

10:37.596 --> 10:40.682
Look! The tracks go different
directions!

10:40.933 --> 10:44.311
I've seen guys do splits,
but this is ridiculous!

10:44.520 --> 10:47.105
We should split to follow the tracks!

10:47.314 --> 10:51.860
Daphne and I will take this set
of tracks. You guys follow the other.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.906
- If you find anything, give the signal!
- Like this?

10:57.616 --> 11:00.285
Yeah, that's it. Let's go!

11:07.125 --> 11:12.881
- There's that funny pounding again.
- And it's coming from inside.

11:13.131 --> 11:18.595
- I ain't going in there! No way!
- How about that way?

11:20.305 --> 11:24.101
It's as if I've been dipped
in ink and put in a coal mine!

11:24.309 --> 11:26.186
Hold hands so we don't separate.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.023
For a girl you sure got cold,
clammy hands, Velma.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.443
Your hands are like fish
right out of a lake.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.529
I think I feel a doorknob.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.241
- Open it and let's get out of here!
- Yeah, out!

11:45.455 --> 11:47.916
Yikes! There is a Headless Specter!

13:59.798 --> 14:03.427
Help! I'm drowning!
Call the Coast Guard!

14:04.136 --> 14:07.597
Stand up, the water's only knee-deep.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.394
Well, what do you know?

14:12.686 --> 14:16.440
- Look, Scooby, a secret tunnel.
- Uh-oh.

14:16.606 --> 14:21.111
Let's explore this. It could
be a solution to the whole thing.

14:21.278 --> 14:25.866
Yeah, right back into the arms of
that Headless Specter thing!

14:27.409 --> 14:30.203
Look! An old book of some kind.

14:30.370 --> 14:36.877
Old is right. It's a diary, and the
last entry was dated July 12th, 1822.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.130
- What's it say?
- It doesn't make much sense.

14:40.338 --> 14:44.259
"Marching men in single file hide the
secret. Stillwall shows the way."

14:46.094 --> 14:50.307
Thumping noises again! Let's get out
of here and find the others.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.560
They've been gone for a long...
Oops. Hey, look!

14:53.769 --> 14:57.481
- A trap door!
- Let's take a look. And be careful.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.649
Oops.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.279
- I said be careful.
- Sorry.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.822
It's a fruit cellar.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.450
Freddy, someone's coming.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.205
Get ready.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.583
Yipes! Hold it!

15:16.875 --> 15:19.544
Shaggy! Velma! Scooby!

15:19.878 --> 15:21.505
Oh, thank goodness, it's you!

15:21.671 --> 15:24.382
Thank goodness it's you, with food.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.345
My stomach's emptier than a piggy bank
after Christmas.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.263
Me too.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.812
Huh?

15:36.978 --> 15:41.441
- What's the matter?
- Balloons! Rubber balloons!

15:44.986 --> 15:48.323
- Why would anyone can balloons?
- Wait a minute.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.618
Does this helium gas spark an idea?

15:51.827 --> 15:54.496
It sure does! I think I've got it now!

16:00.669 --> 16:04.923
This sheet with eyeholes
over the helium balloon will float.

16:05.132 --> 16:09.594
- Is this your ghost, guys?
- Anybody could make a mistake, even us.

16:12.222 --> 16:16.309
Never mind that. Velma,
what do you make of this entry?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.605
"Marching men in single file..."
Could a column...?

16:20.814 --> 16:24.234
This place is filled with
columns. But which one?

16:24.442 --> 16:27.195
Of course! Stillwall shows the way!

16:27.404 --> 16:30.866
Remember that picture of Stillwall?
He's pointing!

16:31.283 --> 16:34.953
Find the column
he's pointing at, and we'll solve it.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.039
He seems to be pointing out
that window!

16:40.667 --> 16:43.461
There's nothing but a greenhouse.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.006
And there aren't any columns.

16:46.173 --> 16:50.385
Shaggy, why don't you
and Scoob take a look to make sure.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.639
Don't seem to be anything in here
at all, especially no columns!

16:56.099 --> 17:01.479
What do you know? A flytrap lily.
Let's give it a Scooby Snack.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.073
Yipes!

17:16.578 --> 17:18.121
Yipes!

17:23.168 --> 17:27.214
Why did we run in here again?
Now he's got us for sure!

17:27.631 --> 17:29.466
Like, here he comes now!

17:29.925 --> 17:32.177
- Balloons!
Balloons?

17:32.427 --> 17:35.931
Oh, I get it. We'll up, up, and away!

17:37.933 --> 17:41.478
Let's see old Headless Harry
get us now!

17:42.520 --> 17:43.563
Uh-oh.

17:49.361 --> 17:54.991
Hey, you guys! Do something! Help!

17:55.450 --> 17:58.787
Holy smoke, there really is a
Headless Specter!

17:58.954 --> 18:00.789
I tried to tell you!

18:00.956 --> 18:03.458
But what can we do to help them?

18:06.795 --> 18:08.463
Hey, watch it!

18:13.885 --> 18:15.220
No, Scoob!

18:18.807 --> 18:22.727
Look out below!

18:26.773 --> 18:28.108
Are you all right?

18:28.316 --> 18:31.569
We had a soft landing,
thanks to the feathers.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.446
Hey, what's this?

18:33.613 --> 18:36.700
Oh, my aching head!

18:36.992 --> 18:38.493
Hey! You really have a head!

18:38.660 --> 18:41.329
Who are you? What's all this about?

18:41.496 --> 18:44.332
I'm Penrod Stillwall. Great-great-...

18:44.499 --> 18:47.002
great-grandson
of Jefferson Stillwall.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.338
- Why be headless?
- I invented the legend of the...

18:50.505 --> 18:54.551
Headless Specter to scare people.
I rigged the floating...

18:54.759 --> 18:56.803
candle and the headless picture.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.348
But why, man? You scared us
half to death.

19:00.515 --> 19:04.853
There's a hidden treasure in that
house that's rightly mine. I was...

19:05.020 --> 19:07.522
afraid someone would
find it and steal it!

19:07.856 --> 19:10.817
- We don't want it!
- We'll even help you look for it.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.863
The thumping noises.
We thought it was you!

19:15.071 --> 19:16.573
I thought it was you!

19:16.781 --> 19:19.826
- Sounds like a ghost in the attic.
- Let's get him out!

19:19.993 --> 19:22.203
I get dizzy in high places.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.416
Shag and I will see what it is.
The rest of you be ready.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.209
Here's what we'll do.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.837
Look!

19:33.506 --> 19:38.011
- What is it?
- I don't know! But we'll find out!

19:42.182 --> 19:44.893
- Get a head start!
- He spotted us!

19:48.021 --> 19:51.066
Get ready! He's right behind us!

19:57.364 --> 20:00.533
Let's see who our phony phantom
really is.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.577
It's Asa Shanks!

20:02.994 --> 20:04.496
My greedy neighbor!

20:04.704 --> 20:09.000
Trying to steal the treasure.
If there is a treasure, that is!

20:10.877 --> 20:14.047
That's it! It was supposed to be
in a carpetbag.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.217
Like, wow! You're rich, Mr. Stillwall!

20:17.384 --> 20:20.387
I'd have found it if it wasn't
for you snoopers!

20:20.553 --> 20:25.392
- How can I thank you?
- Point us to a pizza parlor...

20:25.558 --> 20:28.603
before Scoob and I collapse
from starvation.

20:30.146 --> 20:34.359
I don't get it. The money
was in the column as Velma figured?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.445
But the picture pointed
to the greenhouse.

20:37.654 --> 20:43.034
- Someone must have moved it.
- It would have pointed at the column.

20:43.243 --> 20:48.790
End of mystery, end of pizza. On to
the rock music festival! Right, Scoob?

20:49.374 --> 20:52.043
Yeah! Scooby-Doo!

21:45.472 --> 21:46.514
Shh!
