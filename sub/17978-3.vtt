WEBVTT

00:10.833 --> 00:11.533
PREVIOUSLY ON THE L WORD...

00:11.567 --> 00:12.400
THIS IS MAX SWEENEY.

00:12.433 --> 00:13.133
NICE
TO MEET YOU.

00:13.167 --> 00:14.033
THAT'S SWEET.

00:14.067 --> 00:15.300
LET ME TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE BAD.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.200
YOU GET TO STAY.

00:19.233 --> 00:20.867
I NEED YOU TO DO
ONE LAST THING FOR ME.

00:20.900 --> 00:23.133
HE SENT YOU TO FIRE ME?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.167
IT WAS A POWER TRIP.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.200
HE'S A SCUMBAG.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.467
I'VE NEVER HAD
AN ABORTION.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.367
IT MUST BE REALLY HARD.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.367
I FEEL SO SAD FOR ANGUS.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.633
YOU CAN BE SAD
FOR YOURSELF, TOO.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.100
YOU'RE PAPI.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.367
ACTUALLY,
IT'S PRONOUNCED PAH-PI.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.700
I CAN MAKE A WOMAN COME
JUST BY KISSING HER.

00:39.733 --> 00:41.367
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU WERE GOING TO GO?

00:41.400 --> 00:43.300
HOME.
I'M YOUR HOME NOW, OKAY?

00:43.333 --> 00:44.767
IT'S ILLEGAL TO KEEP
A CHILD OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.033
WELL, LET THEM ARREST ME.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.400
YOU PICK A T.A. YET?

00:47.433 --> 00:48.467
NADIA. NADIA KARELLA.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.300
YOU'RE THE MOST GLAMOROUS DEAN

00:49.333 --> 00:50.567
THEY'VE HAD IN YEARS.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.200
WE CALL HER
"HEADS-WILL-ROLL KROLL",

00:52.233 --> 00:53.533
BECAUSE SHE FIRES
AT LEAST ONE DEAN A YEAR.

00:53.567 --> 00:54.867
I THINK I'M A LESBIAN, BETTE.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.133
OH.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.133
I ONLY CHOOSE BOOKS TO REVIEW

00:57.167 --> 00:59.533
THAT HOLD
SIGNIFICANCE TO ME.

00:59.567 --> 01:00.600
WHY DOES
SOME OF HER PARTS

01:00.633 --> 01:02.267
HOLD SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU?

01:02.300 --> 01:03.767
MY PARTNER'S A SURVIVOR.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.600
"SELF-INDULGENT
AND SELF-PITYING"?

01:06.633 --> 01:08.700
FUCK YOU, STACEY MERKIN!

01:08.733 --> 01:10.367
FUCK YOU!

01:10.400 --> 01:13.500

02:00.067 --> 02:06.800

* THIS IS THE WAY
IT'S THE WAY THAT WE LIVE *

02:26.900 --> 02:28.200

LOVING, BREATHING *

02:28.233 --> 02:30.133
* FIGHTING, FUCKING
CRYING, DRINKING *

02:30.167 --> 02:31.500

LOSING, CHEATING *

02:31.533 --> 02:33.200

02:35.233 --> 02:38.067

02:53.433 --> 02:55.667
MM-HMM.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.067
OOH! THIS IS THE ONE.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.867
ASSOCIATION OF
AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES

02:58.900 --> 03:00.500
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
CONFERENCE.

03:00.533 --> 03:01.733
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST...

03:01.767 --> 03:03.467
TAKE THAT WITH YOU.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.533
JUST FIND OUT
WHO TOOK PART IN THE MEDIA LAB

03:05.567 --> 03:06.667
AND MAKE ME A LIST

03:06.700 --> 03:08.600
WITH THE BIOS
AND CONTACT INFORMATION, OKAY?

03:08.633 --> 03:09.600
DO YOU HAVE A KNOT?

03:09.633 --> 03:11.067
DO YOU NEED ME TO UNLOCK IT?

03:11.067 --> 03:12.233
IT'S-- IT'S OKAY.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.333
NO, REALLY.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.333
IT'S FINE.

03:14.367 --> 03:15.667
OH, WOW.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.367
YOU ARE REALLY TIGHT.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.433
GOD, DO YOU FEEL THAT?

03:19.467 --> 03:20.467
NADIA, PLEASE--

03:20.500 --> 03:21.733
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

03:21.767 --> 03:22.767
DO YOU WANT ME TO
FIND YOU A BODYWORKER,

03:22.800 --> 03:24.100
BECAUSE, OH, MY GOSH,

03:24.133 --> 03:26.500
I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING
AYURVEDIC HEALER,

03:26.533 --> 03:27.700
AND HE WENT SO DEEP--

03:27.733 --> 03:29.067
I-I-I PREFER A WOMAN.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.233
WELL...

03:34.267 --> 03:36.800
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED,
DEAN PORTER.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.933
ACTUALLY, I'M FINE, NADIA.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.067
I JUST, UH...

03:48.100 --> 03:49.333
I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT

03:49.367 --> 03:51.133
WHAT CONFERENCES

03:51.167 --> 03:52.200
C.U. HAS HOSTED.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.567
I KNOW THAT WE DID

03:53.600 --> 03:55.667
THE GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
LAST AUGUST.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.667
WHERE DR. GORSHAM

03:56.700 --> 03:58.067
SUSTAINED MULTIPLE HICKEYS

03:58.067 --> 03:59.900
FROM HIS TWO
TEACHING ASSISTANTS.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.967
YOU MEAN HE SLEPT
WITH BOTH OF THEM?

04:04.067 --> 04:05.167
DON'T BE SHOCKED.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.800
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.733
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE.

04:08.767 --> 04:11.167
NO, BUT WE'RE ALL ADULTS,
BETTE.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.900
I MEAN, IN A CLOISTERED
ENVIRONMENT

04:12.933 --> 04:14.300
LIKE A UNIVERSITY,

04:14.333 --> 04:16.700
IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO THINK

04:16.733 --> 04:19.700
THAT THERE WEREN'T RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN FACULTY AND STUDENTS.

04:19.733 --> 04:24.067
I HADN'T GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT,
TO BE HONEST, NADIA.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.533
WELL...

04:25.567 --> 04:27.200
I KNOW THE STUDENTS
IN YOUR COLLEGE HAVE.

04:27.233 --> 04:31.067
I KNOW AT LEAST 20
WHO WOULD LOVE TO BE WITH YOU.

04:37.467 --> 04:40.333
THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.900
I HATE
THAT I'M JUST ONE OF THE PACK.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.933
ALL RIGHT.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.900
LET'S DO THIS.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.400
[MAN]:
I AM GOING TO NEED TO SEE

05:18.433 --> 05:19.400
SOME KIND OF PAPERWORK.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.067
I DON'T HAVE
A BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.433
L.A.U.S.D. REQUIRES

05:22.467 --> 05:23.867
COMPLETE HEALTH
AND IMMUNIZATION RECORDS.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.567
HAS SHAY BEEN VACCINATED?

05:27.100 --> 05:28.533
HAVE YOU BEEN
VACCINATED?

05:28.567 --> 05:29.967
I THINK SO.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.467
DO YOU KNOW THE NAME
OF YOUR DOCTOR?

05:31.500 --> 05:32.967
NO.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.567
DID YOU GO
TO A PUBLIC CLINIC?

05:36.067 --> 05:39.067
DOES HE HAVE ANY, UH...
ANY ALLERGIES?

05:39.067 --> 05:42.933
ANY LEARNING DISABILITIES,
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.067
DO YOU?

05:44.067 --> 05:45.600
NAH. DOUBT IT.

05:45.633 --> 05:47.200
LISTEN TO ME.
OVER HERE.

05:47.233 --> 05:48.733
HOW DID HE DO
ON HIS STANFORD 9?

05:48.767 --> 05:50.467
I DON'T HAVE
ANY OF THIS INFORMATION, SO--

05:50.500 --> 05:51.933
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU DO KNOW--

05:51.967 --> 05:53.067
I'M SORRY
WE'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

05:53.100 --> 06:02.867
YOU'RE NOT WASTING--
GET YOUR STUFF.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.633
MY MOM WAS PROUD OF ME
FOR MY SCORE ON THAT TEST.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.667
HOLD ON.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.200
MR. PETERSEN.

06:17.233 --> 06:18.433
LOOK, I'M NOT A--

06:18.467 --> 06:20.667
OKAY, I DON'T...
I DON'T KNOW THAT KID.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.933
I MEAN, HE'S MY HALF-BROTHER,
BUT...

06:22.967 --> 06:24.300
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.333
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE PARENTS ARE?

06:26.367 --> 06:28.700
YEAH, OUR, UH...

06:28.733 --> 06:33.300
OUR FATHER BAILED ON HIM,
WHICH HE ALSO DID TO ME,

06:33.333 --> 06:37.367
AND HIS MOTHER
IS MENTALLY UNFIT.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.267
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

06:38.300 --> 06:39.200
NO.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.400
AND BEFORE YOU ASK,

06:40.433 --> 06:41.433
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
SHE'LL BE COMING BACK.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.600
BUT LISTEN,
I KNOW THIS.

06:44.633 --> 06:46.600
I'M NOT GOING TO LET SHAY
LIVE IN SOME HOMELESS SHELTER

06:46.633 --> 06:48.600
THE WAY I DID WHEN I WAS A KID.

06:48.633 --> 06:49.600
OKAY?

06:49.633 --> 06:50.767
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
THE TRUTH IS

06:50.800 --> 06:52.433
HE'S--

06:52.467 --> 06:54.633
HE'S IN A NICE HOUSE
IN SPAULDING SQUARE,

06:54.667 --> 06:56.767
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER
FROM THIS NICE SCHOOL,

06:56.800 --> 06:58.467
AND HE NEEDS TO BE HERE.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.933
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:00.967 --> 07:02.700
I MEAN, LISTEN...

07:02.733 --> 07:04.833
I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL--

07:04.867 --> 07:06.333
I'LL GET YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED.

07:06.367 --> 07:07.333
I SWEAR IT.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.933
BUT I'M BEGGING YOU

07:09.967 --> 07:12.400
TO PLEASE JUST LET HIM
GO TO SCHOOL HERE.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.833
PLEASE.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.133
THAT IS SO FUCKING GROSS.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.800
SO I FOUND
AN S. MERKIN.

07:21.833 --> 07:22.833
TUNA.

07:22.867 --> 07:23.900
EW.

07:23.933 --> 07:24.900
IN VAN NUYS,

07:24.933 --> 07:26.067
WHICH, OF COURSE,

07:26.067 --> 07:27.400
IS WHERE THAT VAGINA WAG'S
GOING TO LIVE.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.433
SO--

07:28.467 --> 07:29.433
"VAGINA WAG"?

07:29.467 --> 07:30.433
MERKIN.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.933
OH, MERKIN.
STACEY MERKIN.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.300
SO, UM, I GO
TO THE HOUSE,

07:34.333 --> 07:36.067
AND I'M STANDING
OUT FRONT,

07:36.067 --> 07:38.100
AND I'M, LIKE,
"YO, STACEY!

07:38.133 --> 07:39.700
"COME HERE AND SAY IT
TO MY FUCKING FACE,

07:39.733 --> 07:41.300
YOU FUCKING VAGINA!"

07:41.333 --> 07:43.700
AND SO GUESS WHO
COMES DOWN.

07:43.733 --> 07:45.833
IT'S, LIKE,
THIS LITTLE, LIKE,

07:45.867 --> 07:47.433
90-YEAR-OLD
KOREAN LADY

07:47.467 --> 07:50.067
THAT'S, LIKE,
"LOOK WHAT TIME IT IS.

07:50.067 --> 07:51.367
"IT IS 4:00
IN THE MORNING.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.700
I'M GOING TO CALL
THE POLICE ON YOU!"

07:52.733 --> 07:53.767
YOU WERE YELLING
UNDER HER BALCONY

07:53.800 --> 07:55.067
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING?

07:55.067 --> 07:56.367
I WAS, BUT DID YOU
READ THE REVIEW?

07:56.400 --> 07:57.733
YES.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.067
IT WAS FUNDAMENTALLY
DISHONEST, SO...

07:59.067 --> 08:00.933
OH, YEAH. I MEAN, YEAH.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.400
I MEAN, LESBIANS
LOVE TO EAT THEIR OWN.

08:02.433 --> 08:03.967
IT'S TRUE.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.233
AND THE THING IS,

08:05.267 --> 08:07.267
THE VAGINA'S GIRLFRIEND
WAS MOLESTED,

08:07.300 --> 08:08.867
AND NOW SHE'S, LIKE,
THIS PERFECT SAINT,

08:08.900 --> 08:10.167
WHICH IS AWESOME,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.667
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS ABUSED,

08:11.700 --> 08:14.200
AND I'M, LIKE,
THIS FUCKED-UP NITWIT.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.900
BUT THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE,
AND THAT'S MINE,

08:16.933 --> 08:18.633
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE'S SLAMMING ME

08:18.667 --> 08:20.567
FOR MY OWN EXPERIENCE,
YOU KNOW?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
RIGHT. I GET IT.

08:21.633 --> 08:22.767
I TOTALLY GET IT.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.933
I'M JUST SAYING
I THINK YOU SHOULD LET IT GO.

08:23.967 --> 08:24.933
IT'S A TINY MAGAZINE.

08:24.967 --> 08:25.900
I MEAN, WHO READS IT?

08:25.933 --> 08:27.233
I WILL LET IT GO.

08:27.267 --> 08:28.667
AND DIDN'T ELLE
SAY SOMETHING GREAT

08:28.700 --> 08:31.400
ABOUT, WHAT,
"REFRESHINGLY LITERATE"?

08:31.433 --> 08:32.433
THAT'S HUGE.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.767
THAT'S ELLE.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.933
CONCENTRATE
ON THAT.

08:34.967 --> 08:35.933
RIGHT.

08:35.967 --> 08:36.933
I'LL LET IT GO.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.067
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

08:38.067 --> 08:39.933
WHAT?

08:39.967 --> 08:41.067
I MET PAPI.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.667
NO! WHAT HAPPENED?

08:42.700 --> 08:44.667
OH, THE LEGEND TRANSCENDS.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.733
SHE'S A WALKING,
LIVING, BREATHING LOTHARIO.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.067
AND?
AND I TOTALLY FELL FOR IT.

08:48.067 --> 08:48.967
WHAT DID YOU DO?

08:49.067 --> 08:50.200
UM, WELL, YOU KNOW--

08:50.233 --> 08:51.333
DID YOU FUCK HER?

08:51.367 --> 08:52.233
YEAH--
OH, MY GOD.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.367
OKAY, WE WERE IN THE BACK

08:53.400 --> 08:54.667
OF THIS
SUPER-TRICKED-OUT STRETCH.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.833
UH-HUH.
IT WAS HOT.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.267
SHE WAS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.400
WAS SHE GOOD?
YEAH.

08:58.433 --> 08:59.667
SHE'S BEEN WITH
A LOT OF GIRLS, SO--

08:59.700 --> 09:00.833
LIKE SHANE?

09:00.867 --> 09:02.300
NO, MORE THAN SHANE.
OH, MY GOD.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.800
OKAY, TO GIVE YOU
AN EXAMPLE...

09:03.833 --> 09:05.633
I WASN'T SURE
IF I SHOULD TELL YOU,

09:05.667 --> 09:08.967
BUT SHE WAS, UH,
WITH HELENA THE SAME DAY.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.167
WELL, THE MORNING
OF THE NIGHT AFTER

09:10.200 --> 09:11.833
THAT WE HAD--

09:11.867 --> 09:13.933
SHE FUCKED HELENA
RIGHT AFTER SHE FUCKED YOU?

09:13.967 --> 09:15.333
YOUR ROOMMATE?

09:15.367 --> 09:16.633
THAT'S SO RUDE.
