it's terrible.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.918
How is she?
Does she like Washington?

01:58.985 --> 01:59.953
She says it's awesome.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.557
It sounds like
Maria's going to
fit in perfectly.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.959
Sounds like it.

02:09.429 --> 02:14.234
Luke, I know it's hard
when a really good friend,

02:14.300 --> 02:17.637
someone you really care about,
moves out of your life,

02:17.704 --> 02:19.339
but you'll see her again.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.574
Well, she's coming back
for her mum's wedding,
isn't she?

02:21.641 --> 02:24.444
-I'm sure we'll all
meet up then.
-It won't be the same.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.413
Maybe not, but you know,
that's not always so bad.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.084
One of the best
things about life
is it's always surprising us.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.057
Morning, people.
This is Clyde Langer reporting
live from Bannerman Road,

02:38.124 --> 02:41.895
where at this precise moment
there's a new family moving
in at number 36.

02:48.067 --> 02:50.870
Boy, they've no idea
what they're moving in
over the road from.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.039
No, and they're never
going to find out,
do you hear?

02:53.106 --> 02:56.142
Both of you, promise me
you'll never breathe
a word about what we do.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.878
-Mr Smith, any of it.
-Why would we?

02:58.945 --> 03:00.079
It's not like
it's Maria, is it?

03:01.414 --> 03:04.651
-Come on,
we're going to be late.
-Yeah, sure.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.922
Don't worry.
We won't say anything.

03:08.988 --> 03:12.158
We'd just better hope Maria
never left anything
lying around when she went.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.761
-What do you mean?
-Oh, you know,
we've been hanging out

03:14.827 --> 03:17.564
with some pretty random
intergalactic sorts.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.066
Who knows what
might have rubbed off
and still be over there?

03:25.738 --> 03:29.142
-I did not fancy Maria.
-Boy,
I taught you well, didn't I?

03:29.208 --> 03:32.145
Clyde's Cool Rule Number Two,
deny all emotion,

03:32.211 --> 03:34.714
-especially when
involving girls.
-I just miss her,

03:34.781 --> 03:36.382
okay? Don't you?

03:36.449 --> 03:39.385
'Course I miss her.
But people move on, Luke.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.589
-Ask my mum and dad.
-I've never
lost anyone before.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.425
Well, it's not going to be
the same without her
that's for sure.

-Don't... Don't mention it.
It's no problem.
-Sorry.

-I'm looking for
Mr Cunningham's form.
-That's our class.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.815
-I start today.
-And you run into me.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.284
-Now that's what
I call a start.
-Yeah.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.587
Like starting the 100 metres
in the Olympics
and tripping over your laces.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.589

He thinks he's cool.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.358
-I'm Luke.
-Who isn't.

My family just moved into
Bannerman Road.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.298
-Bannerman Road?
-Of course. Where else?

04:25.365 --> 04:28.668
Sarah Jane's right.
The universe
never stops weirding you out.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.105
-Sarah who?
-Never mind. Come on,
I'll take you to class.

not to play about.

since your last Head Teacher
Mr Blakeman disappeared,

05:45.511 --> 05:49.716

standards around here
vanished with him.

on the bridge now.

sinking feeling.

but, believe me,
I run a very tight ship.

to be this funny.
-No, Langer.

to shut up and listen.

give in to chaos.

-We can be friends.
-Yeah.
But it wouldn't be the same.

-No.
I didn't mean it like that.

mind me telling you,

but you do know

don't you?

I think you're all right.
Just a bit strange.

I'm not strange,
I'm just different.

-There's a difference.
-Yeah. I suppose.

though, that is weird.

don't have a clue.

13:06.652 --> 13:07.887
There it is!

13:08.621 --> 13:09.722
Where?

13:10.222 --> 13:11.190
Come on!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.911
He's there! Come on.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.663
-Where is he?
-Search me.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.933
But he was here.

13:57.536 --> 13:58.604
Look.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.474
-Don't touch it!
-Why?

14:02.541 --> 14:05.044
I don't know why. Just don't!

14:05.110 --> 14:07.613
(LAUGHS)

14:07.680 --> 14:10.482
-But you didn't tell anyone?
-What am I supposed to say,

14:10.549 --> 14:12.151
"Look, Mum and Dad,
I don't want to worry you,

14:12.218 --> 14:14.987
"but I'm seeing clowns
that no one else can see?"

14:15.054 --> 14:17.623
-Why not?
-Do you want them
to get me locked up?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.192
-Why would they do that?
-What planet is he from?

14:20.259 --> 14:23.028
Oh, Earth. Mostly.

14:23.095 --> 14:26.732
(SIGHS) Yeah, you're so funny,
Clyde. No wonder,
the Head Teacher loves you.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.271
Look, Rani,
whatever this clown thing is,

14:32.338 --> 14:34.440
I think we should leave it
to the police, don't you?

14:34.506 --> 14:36.675
They don't even
believe it exists,
you know that.

14:36.742 --> 14:38.577
Clyde's right.
It's nothing to do with us.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.980
There's something happening
here that doesn't make
everyday sense.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.949
Maybe you can ignore it as
it doesn't go
with your mp3 player

14:44.016 --> 14:46.619
or your designer trainers,
but I can't.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.220
-I've got to know what's
going on.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.155
-Sarah Jane's going to love
this one.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.959
Look, there's something
I've got to tell you.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.828
Something about me
you ought to know.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.963
You're from another planet.
I already guessed.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.732
Actually, Clyde,
it's worse than that.

15:01.767 --> 15:04.837
Oh, no. Rani, please tell me
there's a good reason

15:04.903 --> 15:07.539
why our new
Head just pulled up
outside your house

15:07.606 --> 15:09.174
that doesn't
involve the word "dad".

15:09.241 --> 15:11.110
Honestly,
he's all right, really.
It's just his job.

15:11.176 --> 15:14.179
Yeah, that they said
about Doctor Frankenstein.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.115
-Rani.
-Hi, Dad.

15:16.181 --> 15:20.986
Haresh! Don't worry,
there's still plenty of boxes
for you to open.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.889
Rani, how was your
first day at school?

15:23.956 --> 15:26.258
-Did your dad go all
Captain Bligh again?
-(BOTH LAUGH)

15:26.325 --> 15:28.394
I do not go Captain Bligh.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.896
Yeah, just a bit.
This is Luke and Clyde.

15:30.963 --> 15:33.599
-Luke Smith.
Pleased to meet you.
-Oh.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.702
-Luke Smith?
-He's my son.
I'm Sarah Jane Smith.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.104
I've been
looking at his results
for the past year.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.540
Very, very impressive.
Remarkable, in fact.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.777
Yes, well, he's very gifted.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.645
-Sarah's a journalist.
-For real?

15:46.712 --> 15:49.114
I'm really interested
in becoming a reporter.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.516
Maybe I can
come over some time?

15:50.582 --> 15:52.718
-Oh, well,
I really am rather busy.
-Oh.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.588
Clyde Langer, the joker
in the pack, apparently.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.891
Oh, and I see
clowns that don't exist.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.962
Of course your
Head Teacher was never
going to believe you, Clyde.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.333
Nor would the police.
Children don't
vanish out of closed rooms.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.735
It's impossible
as far as they are concerned.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.071
But what about the clown?

16:12.137 --> 16:16.241
If it's an alien taking these
kids, a clown disguise isn't
exactly low-profile, is it?

16:16.308 --> 16:18.110
But it might know that
kids are supposed to
like clowns.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.546
Personally, they always
gave me nightmares.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.314
Clourophobia,
it's the fear of clowns.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.949
Johnny Depp has it.

16:24.016 --> 16:27.119
-What encyclopaedia
did you find that in?
<i>-Heat.</i>

16:27.186 --> 16:30.389
Now we need to talk to someone
close to this boy
that went missing today.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.825
His parents will be too busy
with the police by now.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.259
What about any of his friends?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.495
It's Monday so they'll be
at football training.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.831
What about Rani?
She's been seeing
the clown too.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.866
I don't want her involved.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.468
Well, she seems
pretty determined
to find out what's going on.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.036
And she might be in danger.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.604
You're right.
Someone should keep
an eye on her.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.473
Yeah! Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll do that.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.908
Only I don't think her dad
would let you go
anywhere near her.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.145
(CHUCKLING)

16:56.215 --> 16:59.084
So, it looks as if
the boy disappeared
like the others.

16:59.151 --> 17:02.855
Oh. His poor parents must be
going out of their minds.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.223
(SHUDDERS)

17:04.289 --> 17:06.425
Makes me ill,
just thinking about it.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.294
-You watch yourself,
won't you, Rani?
-She'll be fine,

17:09.361 --> 17:11.997
as long as she stays away
from that Langer boy.

17:12.064 --> 17:17.002
David Finn is one of Clyde's
best friends, Dad.
He wasn't making it up.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.038
Clyde saw a clown.
Why would he lie?

17:20.105 --> 17:23.075
I don't know.
But a clown, it's ridiculous.

17:23.142 --> 17:26.345
I was thinking I should let
the police take a look
at Finn's school books.

17:26.412 --> 17:29.081
There's still a chance that
something was worrying him
and he ran away.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.116
If so, there may be
a clue there.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.385
Before that,
you can help me move the bed.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.321
Those removal men
didn't listen to
a word I said.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.691
-And they got out alive?
-Come on, I'll show you.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.049
No. You're not there.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.822
(LAUGHING)

18:11.056 --> 18:13.559
Rani, you've got a visitor.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.093
Thought you might
need a hand unpacking.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.697
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

18:18.764 --> 18:21.033
My dad says
journalists are scum.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.635
They're like crows
picking at roadkill.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.138
Well, I guess he only
buys a newspaper
to look at the pictures then.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.707
(LAUGHS)

18:28.774 --> 18:31.543
Oh, come on, Steve.
Sarah Jane is trying
to help find Finney.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.080
-I don't know anything.
-Well, had he been acting
strangely recently?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.749
-No, not that I saw.
-What about clowns?

18:37.816 --> 18:39.184
Did he ever say
anything about clowns?

18:39.251 --> 18:40.686
(LAUGHING) No.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.490
Hang on.

18:46.125 --> 18:51.063
<i>There was this clown</i>
<i>handing out</i>
<i>tickets by the station.</i>

18:51.129 --> 18:52.898
(LAUGHING)

18:56.168 --> 18:59.805
Oi, take a hike, Krusty.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.875
So, Tony Warner,
the boy that went missing
in the park,

19:02.941 --> 19:04.710
-he took a ticket, as well?
-Yeah.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.578
But they were just
tickets from a clown.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.614
-It doesn't mean anything,
does it?
-What were the tickets for?

19:08.680 --> 19:12.217
Just a minute.
I'd forgotten all about this.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.454
My mum picked it up
for me at the shops.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.657
SARAH JANE: Spellman's Magical
Museum of the Circus.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.459
Like I'd want to go.

19:23.428 --> 19:26.865
It was in the kitchen, Luke.
It's getting closer to me.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.401
Don't worry, it's gone now.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.503
There's more. Look at this.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.308
Dad's taking Finney's books
to the police.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.110
They're looking for clues,

19:38.176 --> 19:40.879
but I don't think
they'll be looking
for size 20 footprints.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.814
If they do
take this seriously,

19:42.881 --> 19:44.583
there might not be
anything they can do.

19:44.650 --> 19:48.020
You see, this isn't natural.
None of it.
It's supernatural!

19:48.086 --> 19:50.656
-I doubt it's supernatural.
-You've got
such a closed mind!

19:50.722 --> 19:53.659
The supernatural
is only science
we don't know yet,

19:53.725 --> 19:55.894
-like life on other planets.
-That's different.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.230
I've got to do something,
Luke. Look at those pictures.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.300
Finney was seeing the
clown the same as I am.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.936
"Spellman's Magical Museum
of the Circus"?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.473
People were handing these out
by the Tube.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.108
I think you
should talk to my mum.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.443
But I can't talk to anyone,
Luke.
Don't you get it?

20:11.510 --> 20:13.478
You haven't seen the clown.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.148
I think only kids
that get one of these
can see it.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.317
-And then they disappear!
-Clyde saw it.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.852
-Then he must have a ticket.
-Believe me, Mum
understands things like this.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.220
Oh, Luke,
whatever's going on here,

20:22.287 --> 20:24.556
no one understands
things like this.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.892
But this ticket,
it's got to be a clue.
Are you coming?

20:32.230 --> 20:35.467
CLYDE: Welcome to
the Circus of Horrors.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.336
You know, Clyde, occasionally,
your sense of humour

20:37.402 --> 20:39.204
really leaves
something to be desired.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.472
Who said I was joking?

20:42.341 --> 20:43.875
Are you all right?

20:43.942 --> 20:45.911
Clowns make my skin crawl.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.681
Come on.

20:54.252 --> 20:56.521
(LAUGHING)

21:03.895 --> 21:07.499
Like, museums don't
normally creep me out,

21:08.967 --> 21:10.936
all those stuffed animals,

21:12.070 --> 21:14.906
old bones and mummies,

21:16.508 --> 21:19.778
but this place doesn't just
take the biscuit,

21:19.845 --> 21:22.314
this place gets
the whole Christmas tin.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.750
SPELLMAN: Welcome, welcome

21:24.816 --> 21:28.787
to Spellman's Magical Museum
of the Circus

21:28.854 --> 21:34.960
and the story of the most
wondrous family
entertainment in the world.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.964
From the tumblers and jugglers
of Ancient Rome

21:41.366 --> 21:44.836
to the father of
the modern circus.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.339
Believe it or not,

21:47.406 --> 21:51.910
a sergeant-major
in the 15th Light Dragoons.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.746
Mr Spellman, I presume.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.984
Elijah Spellman
at your service.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.787
My name is Sarah Jane Smith.
I'm a journalist.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.260
This is my friend, Clyde.

22:08.326 --> 22:11.029
-We're here to talk
to you about clowns.
-Ah.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.532
The princes of
the sawdust ring!

22:15.267 --> 22:16.401
This way, please.

22:20.772 --> 22:26.144
Mankind has
always needed someone
to make them laugh,

22:26.745 --> 22:29.414
slave or king.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.149
Can you do me a favour
and drop a note
to my Head Teacher?

22:33.552 --> 22:38.457
The Pharaohs had fools,
so did the Native Americans.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.625
We had harlequins.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.063
And in the Middle Ages,
the jester.

22:45.130 --> 22:49.000
It's not
the clown's showbiz history
that I'm interested in

22:49.067 --> 22:51.536
as their reputation
for scaring people.

22:51.603 --> 22:55.841
The fear of the painted smile.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.546
It's not as simple as that,
Mr Spellman.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.982
They used to paint clowns
on the walls
of children's wards,

23:04.049 --> 23:07.152
but, when they were asked,
every child said
the pictures scared them.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.687
Children sense things.

23:10.622 --> 23:12.023
I know.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.426
-Come on!
-I really don't think
we should be doing this.

23:14.493 --> 23:17.629
Okay. We won't.
I'll go in on my own.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.268
Sarah Jane, look at this.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.670
These are the same colours
as the clown I saw.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.340
-Red, yellow and blue.
-This isn't a clown.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.975
This is the Pied Piper.

23:30.041 --> 23:33.378
The story goes
he rid Hamelin
of its plague of rats,

23:33.445 --> 23:35.013
then when the town
refused to pay him,

23:35.080 --> 23:37.883
he came back and
took all their children.

23:37.949 --> 23:42.420
The oldest and
most accurate picture
of the Pied Piper.

23:42.487 --> 23:45.457
The colours of
his costume signify

23:45.524 --> 23:50.695
he was
a travelling entertainer,
but I'm afraid,

23:50.762 --> 23:53.498
(WHISPERS) even clowns have
their dark days.

23:55.734 --> 23:59.037
And that's exactly
the sort of clown I'm
interested in, Mr Spellman.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.639
One that makes
children disappear.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.441
But the Pied Piper
was a fairy tale.

24:03.508 --> 24:06.912
Myths, legends, fairy tales.
Every story has
its inspiration, Clyde.

24:08.246 --> 24:09.781
(RATTLING)

24:11.183 --> 24:13.285
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)

24:13.351 --> 24:15.520
-Mr Spellman?
-Where did...
Where did he go?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.522
I don't know.

24:17.589 --> 24:18.890
But something tells me
we should get out
of here, too quickly. Come on!

24:20.192 --> 24:21.393
-Luke!
-Mum!

24:21.459 --> 24:23.862
-What are you doing here?
-What are we doing here?

24:23.929 --> 24:26.798
-What are you doing here?
-You told me to stay with her.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.433
Am I missing something?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.703
-Yeah, and keep her
out of the action.
-What action?

24:31.770 --> 24:33.138
(SCREAMING)

24:33.205 --> 24:35.907
-What's happening?
-RANI: They're moving!

24:37.809 --> 24:39.511
LUKE: Something's animating
the clowns.

24:39.578 --> 24:42.113
SARAH JANE:
Look out, all of you.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.882
-They're alive!
-Run!

24:49.187 --> 24:51.590
-What happened to Spellman?
-He's controlling them.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.392
I think they're like puppets,
probably under some
sort of telekinetic control.

24:54.459 --> 24:56.228
Walking puppets?

24:56.294 --> 24:58.964
-Telekinetic control?
-He's controlling
them with his mind.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.968
-I know what it means, Luke.
Who's Spellman?
-Probably an alien.

25:10.008 --> 25:10.909
Stand back.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.814
-What was that?
-Sonic lipstick.

25:15.881 --> 25:17.015
Never leave home without it.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.818
I've seized up their joints.

25:19.885 --> 25:20.986
Should hold them up
while we get out of here.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.224
Aliens.

25:26.291 --> 25:30.061
-Luke said aliens.
-Actually, he said alien.

25:30.128 --> 25:32.230
And it will
still be around here
somewhere. Come on.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.899
There's no time
for explanations.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.137
She's right.
And from what I've seen,

25:39.204 --> 25:42.440
one alien can be
as much trouble
as a whole invasion.

25:43.441 --> 25:44.843
Come on.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.226
-He's sealed the doors.
-Telekinesis.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.296
The same way he animated
the clown mannequins.

26:04.362 --> 26:07.032
Whatever we're
dealing with here,
it's extremely powerful.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.301
-What did I tell you?
-And it's got us trapped!

26:09.367 --> 26:13.972
-No, Rani.
It just thinks it has.
-Oh, no, Miss Smith.

26:14.039 --> 26:17.242
-I'm convinced of it.
-Are you really an alien?

26:17.309 --> 26:20.545
Stay back, Rani.
Leave this to me.
Who are you?

26:20.612 --> 26:22.847
-And what do you want?
-Who am I?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.550
I am the Pied Piper,

26:25.617 --> 26:28.620
who conjured away
a whole town's infants

26:28.687 --> 26:31.222
and has chilled
the hearts of parents

26:31.289 --> 26:32.958
for more than seven centuries.

26:35.660 --> 26:39.965
And now I am
Odd Bob the Clown,

26:40.165 --> 26:46.037
who snatches
children in the heartbeat
their mother's back is turned.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.908
I am the thing that lives
in the darkest corners.

26:51.242 --> 26:54.879
I am all these
things and more.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.984
I am all that
you fear the most.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.488
And you are mine to feed on!

27:08.960 --> 27:10.428
Mum, I think you have
to tell her everything.

27:10.495 --> 27:11.796
I want to know the truth.

27:11.863 --> 27:14.699
This is a Vorgatt
defence field emitter.

27:14.766 --> 27:15.900
Morning.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.704
I'm going to find
out what you are,
Odd Bob.

27:19.771 --> 27:22.040
We're only scared of
what we don't understand.

27:22.107 --> 27:25.243
I will chill
the blood of a nation.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.146
And millions will shudder,

27:28.213 --> 27:31.983
sleepless with
a bone-gnawing fear.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.085
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)

27:35.920 --> 27:37.922
-Help!
-No!
