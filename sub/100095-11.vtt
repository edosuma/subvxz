If they fooled me,
they've fooled others.

whoever's responsible

11:57.750 --> 12:00.014
so you can get
your casket back.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.848
Forged or stolen art
and antiquities

12:02.890 --> 12:04.517
represent up to 10%

12:04.550 --> 12:08.418
of an art market
valued at over $50 billion.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.189
That's $5 billion.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.427
And, yes, I have a stake
in your finding this forger,

12:13.460 --> 12:16.429
but if they're as good
as I believe them to be,

12:16.460 --> 12:20.396
I'm giving you the tip
of an enormous iceberg.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.762
Reddington actually
underestimated
the problem here.

12:23.810 --> 12:28.509
It turns out that up to 20% of
the art-and-antiquities market
is made up of forgeries.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.670
That's almost $10 billion
worth of counterfeits
being passed off as real

12:32.710 --> 12:35.247
to governments, museums,
and individuals.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.838
$10 billion's
a lot of fakes.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.141
Can it be
that easy to do?

12:38.190 --> 12:40.055
These are great
pieces of art.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.957
Forgers don't have to be great
artists, just great engineers.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.719
What do you mean?
No matter how good
a forger is,

12:44.760 --> 12:46.523
he's basically
copying, right?

12:46.560 --> 12:49.028
And there are technical ways
of doing that,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.494
like camera obscura.

12:51.530 --> 12:54.567
By using mirrors,
you can project an image
onto a canvas,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.205
and if you project that image
in small sections,

12:57.240 --> 12:59.708
you can essentially do a
paint-by-numbers masterpiece.

Reddington and his pals
lifted the caskets
from the Olympian Gallery.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.378
SO he's an art thief now.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.388
He thinks
that if the person
we're looking for

13:13.420 --> 13:16.878
was able to forge
one piece of art there,
he forged others.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.659
Yeah, but there's thousands
of pieces in the museum.

13:18.690 --> 13:19.759
Where would we start?

13:22.330 --> 13:23.467
He thinks it's a fake.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.365

and see if he's right.

off the coast of Maine here.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.778
Architectural drawings
for an estate there.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.812
SO he_ hits museums
and prIvate reSIdences.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.715
And law firms, apparently.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.451
We have proof
it's Vitaris.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.650
And we have motive.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.749
Vitaris is the lead plaintiff
in a class-action lawsuit

22:13.800 --> 22:16.553
against
a pharmaceutical company
owned by the Fenbergs.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.261
Now, if the lawsuit
is to be believed,

22:18.300 --> 22:20.291
then they are as bad
as the Sacklers...

22:20.330 --> 22:22.139
Misleading the public
and the FDA

22:22.170 --> 22:23.865
on how addictive
theIr drugs are.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.799
Did Vitaris get addicted?
No, his son did.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.876
That's right.
After a football injury,

22:28.910 --> 22:30.138
he was prescribed
painkillers,

22:30.180 --> 22:31.875
got hooked,
overdosed a year later.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.810
What does any of this
have to do with the forgeries?

22:33.850 --> 22:35.010
LIZ: The counterfeit Leyster?

22:35.050 --> 22:36.938
The real one belonged
to the Fenbergs.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.709
SO did
Red's nesting casket.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.115
We need to warn
the Fenberg family

22:40.150 --> 22:42.289
they and their art
are being targeted.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.686
Keen, Aram,
get to the Fenberg estate.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.789
Ressler, Park,
bring in the evidence

22:46.830 --> 22:49.526
_ so that we_ can start

22:49.560 --> 22:50.766
Past and future.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.591
First, Vitaris
slanders me in court,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.892
and now you're telling me
he's stealing from me,
as well?

22:55.940 --> 22:57.965
It appears so, yes.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.035
All right,
I've asked my family
to be here for this,

23:00.070 --> 23:01.628
because they are every bit
the victims that I am.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.739
This is my wife, Sue,
and our daughter, Victoria.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.179
SUE: Have you
identified the thief?

23:05.210 --> 23:06.541
We've identified a suspect,

23:06.580 --> 23:08.343
but we're not sure
what role he played

23:08.380 --> 23:10.018
or if he was acting alone.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.143
We believe that he may
have an accomplice.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.418
Have you identified him?

23:13.960 --> 23:16.554
Not yet, but we will.

23:16.590 --> 23:19.150
You sound awfully confident.
Yes, we are.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.658
Well, please, come in.
Tell us what you know.

23:30.570 --> 23:33.061

That's impossible.

23:33.110 --> 23:35.772
MR. FENBERG: Victoria manages
our family collection.
She knows her work.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.347
Every piece in our collection
has been authenticated.

23:38.380 --> 23:40.348
The work you acquired
was real.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.018
The forgeries came later.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.689
The Leyster was taken
three months after you loaned
it to the Olympian Gallery.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.540
But you can get it back.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.387
The suspect must know
where it is.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.217
He may, but we don't
know where he is.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.581
Well, how hard
can he be to find?

23:52.630 --> 23:55.098
He's the lead plaintiff
in the lawsuit against us.

23:55.130 --> 23:57.769
You'd think trying
to destroy us in court
would be enough.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.722
He lost his son.
I don't think he thinks

23:59.770 --> 24:00.964
anything would be enough.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.560
SO you're saying
we're responsible
for his loss?

24:03.610 --> 24:04.668
You're taking his side?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.962
No, of course
she's not taking his side.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.272
Are you, sweetheart?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.902
I'm just saying
it's a stressful time,

24:11.950 --> 24:13.872
for all of us.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.114
Tell us how we can help.

24:15.150 --> 24:16.219
One thing you can do

24:16.250 --> 24:17.911
is to go through
your entire collection.

24:17.950 --> 24:20.214
Now, I know that is
a logistical nightmare,

24:20.250 --> 24:21.956
but if you have
pieces on loan,

24:21.990 --> 24:25.084
get them back,
and authenticate everything.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.927
All right, you've told us
what we can do.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.894
Now I'm gonna tell you
what you're gonna do...

24:28.930 --> 24:30.420
Find Vitaris.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.269
And if he has
an accomplice,
find him.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.063
And when you do,

24:34.100 --> 24:36.068
despite my daughter's
misplaced sympathies,

24:36.100 --> 24:38.705
I'm gonna use
my considerable power

24:38.740 --> 24:41.800
to make sure they pay
for what they've done.

our biggest take yet.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.918
The FBI came to our home.
To warn us about you.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.929
They searched your property.
It's... It's over.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.554
Okay, hang on. We need that
money to keep the suit going.

You're going to be arrested.

They're crating it up.

They're putting it
in secure storage.

There's no way
we can make the swap now.

a distraction at the house?

26:24.650 --> 26:26.299
Wait. I have
a lead on that.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.143
Okay, so, looking at
the previous forgeries

26:31.190 --> 26:32.612
from the Fenberg collection,

26:32.650 --> 26:34.459
it seems that _ _
the counterfeIter speCIaIIzes

26:34.490 --> 26:37.584
in replicating pieces
from the 19th century
or before.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.359
Now, according to
the Fenbergs' portfolio,

26:39.390 --> 26:41.620
the only painting left
in their collection

26:41.660 --> 26:43.628
that matches that description

26:43.670 --> 26:47.162
is a Hoogstraten

it's safe to assume

that Vitaris is going
after the Hoogstraten.

we're after him,

He's gone.

The only way to make sure
others don't die like him

30:47.210 --> 30:48.302
is to see this through,

30:48.340 --> 30:49.409

30:49.440 --> 30:50.737
you're gonna make the swap.

to keep doing that.

37:24.570 --> 37:26.538

on the Hoogstraten.

Ah, I can't say
I'm surprised.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.769

who took it,
who his accomplice is.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.779
I didn't at first.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.879
I mean, we inspected
everybody,

No one we_ checked C_ould've
pOSSIbly taken It.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.085
And then it hit me.

we didn't check...

37:47.560 --> 37:50.199

your mother, and you.

37:50.230 --> 37:52.494

from ourselves?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.504
I think it was for you.
Don't be ridiculous.

inside your briefcase,

38:03.610 --> 38:04.975

38:30.770 --> 38:33.432
It really is exquisite
in its way.

38:33.470 --> 38:36.678
It's exquisite because of
what you know about it,

38:36.710 --> 38:38.974
where it came from,
who made it.

38:39.010 --> 38:40.841
It's intellectual.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.576
I like art
that's more emotional.

38:45.020 --> 38:48.319

played on our emotions.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.657

38:53.130 --> 38:57.453
The counterfeits are nearly
flawless, which is enough,

38:57.500 --> 39:01.869
because our desire
for them to be real

39:01.900 --> 39:04.334
obscures any imperfection,

39:04.910 --> 39:07.401
much like your desire

39:07.440 --> 39:09.635
for the woman in Paris
to be your mother

39:09.680 --> 39:13.707
blinded you to the fact
that she wasn't.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.045
It wasn't just my desire.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.617
SO she told you
she was Katarina?

39:19.650 --> 39:21.515
She did.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.427
And it's difficult for me
to believe she wasn't.

39:24.460 --> 39:28.851
I was convinced my casket
was authentic.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.427
It was nearly impossible
for me to believe it wasn't.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.734
But it was a fake.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.764
And she was, too.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.668
Is that why
you gave us this case?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.700
To show me how easy it is

39:43.740 --> 39:45.446
to mistake
something that's fake

39:45.480 --> 39:46.799
for something that's real?

39:46.850 --> 39:47.908
No, I gave you the case

39:47.950 --> 39:49.713
so I could get my hands
on the casket

39:49.750 --> 39:53.686
and sell it for an obscene
amount of money.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.085
You got it
just so you could sell it?

39:55.120 --> 39:59.227
Yes. And the buyer
is apparently
very impatient.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.057
Is there somewhere
we can drop you?

40:01.090 --> 40:03.558
We're wheels-up

Uh, wherever you're going,

40:08.540 --> 40:09.939
I'd like you to be back
in time...

We'll be back

40:13.370 --> 40:15.907

I'd like to know.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.271
He was right.

(CHUCKLES)

40:26.750 --> 40:28.115
SO are you.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.084
Well, not really.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.884
But you think so.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.922
We think so about each other,
which is, well...

40:38.100 --> 40:39.169
Amazing.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.190
Great.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.561
Now that that's settled,
do you want to come in?

40:44.610 --> 40:46.566
No. I want to break up.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.873
I don't want to.

40:49.910 --> 40:53.448
I mean,
it's the last thing I want.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.573
It's just, we should.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.612
That is, we have to.

40:58.650 --> 41:01.585
**

41:01.620 --> 41:02.917
I don't understand.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.518
What do we do
when we're together?

41:04.560 --> 41:06.949
We trespass. We...

41:06.990 --> 41:08.821
We crash weddings.

41:10.030 --> 41:11.520
We break the law.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.265
_ We made love
In the GemInI capsule

41:13.300 --> 41:15.336
John Glenn
took into space.

41:15.370 --> 41:16.632
Exactly, yes,

41:16.670 --> 41:19.798
which I still_ can't believe
how small It was, rIght?

41:21.210 --> 41:23.474
Scratch that.
That's off-topic.

41:23.510 --> 41:24.977
Okay.

41:25.010 --> 41:27.945
My point,
such that I have one,

41:27.980 --> 41:29.015
is this.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.948
Making love in a rocket ship
is one thing,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.982
one... _
One amaZIng thIng,

41:36.020 --> 41:37.885
but, Elodie,

41:37.920 --> 41:39.626
hoping your
husband dies,

41:41.600 --> 41:43.659
there is nothing amazing
about that.

41:48.700 --> 41:49.928
How is he?

41:49.970 --> 41:51.460
He's on a ventilator.

41:53.870 --> 41:55.178
I am so sorry.

41:55.210 --> 41:56.632
SO am I.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.945
**

42:03.020 --> 42:04.885
This is
a really bad idea.
