00:06.407 --> 00:08.640
(Tim) Yes, um, I was
wondering, we're looking

00:08.709 --> 00:11.910
for accommodations for
five children... okay.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.145
He's been on the phone for a long time.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.279
Who's he talking to?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.414
Who knows?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.716
Splitting is up is pretty complicated.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.786
They probably have to find five
different families to take us.

00:20.855 --> 00:21.854
Four families.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.557
They're sending me to the
orphanage, remember?

00:25.626 --> 00:26.859
Sorry, Max.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.560
You know, I'm actually going.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.796
I mean, I'd rather join the French
Foreign Legion instead of that.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.432
What's that? I'm not really sure.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.967
But it's in a lot of movies.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.568
As far as I can tell, it's
this French army unit

00:36.637 --> 00:37.736
that'll take anybody.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.605
They take you in when
you don't have, like,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.106
a bunch of private islands or...

00:41.175 --> 00:42.908
(Tim) Thank you so much, yeah, thanks.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.443
Thanks, bye, bye.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.612
Guys? I think I might have a plan.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.981
(all talking at once)

00:49.050 --> 00:51.784
Nobody's going anywhere!

00:51.852 --> 00:53.285
It wasn't easy,

00:53.354 --> 00:54.987
but I figured out a way how everybody

00:55.056 --> 00:57.189
can stay together until
Erik and Kate get back.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.625
I do really need to
have a word with them.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.261
Anyway, why didn't you guys tell me

01:02.329 --> 01:03.862
about your real aunt and uncle?

01:03.931 --> 01:05.164
(all) Aunt Hedwig?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.166
Yeah, and Uncle Eugene.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.667
They're gonna come and
stay with you guys

01:08.736 --> 01:10.169
so everybody can stay together.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.737
Isn't it fantastic?

01:13.908 --> 01:16.809
I expected a more... positive reaction.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.044
(weakly) Great... Yay...

(tires screech)

01:23.617 --> 01:24.750
(horn honks)

01:24.819 --> 01:27.052
I don't want to sleep in this house.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.153
It's haunted.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.122
Oh, get a grip, Hedy.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.724
You've been a fraidy cat
ever since we were kids.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.060
It's not haunted.

01:35.129 --> 01:40.165
But it is Hunter property.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.468
Our property.

(doorbell chimes)

01:44.572 --> 01:45.604
(Daniel) What are we worried about?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.940
We already got rid of Hedwig once.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.776
Oh, oh... (maniacal laughter)

01:50.845 --> 01:51.844
We could do it again.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.146
No, we're not.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.814
We're gonna be perfect angels.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.183
We are? Yeah, why?

01:58.252 --> 02:00.486
All Hedwig cares about
is stealing the diamond.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.788
And I bet old Gene is
in on it with her.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.724
Okay, we have to pick up the
fake diamond from Magpie

02:05.793 --> 02:07.025
and deliver it to Saganash.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.560
If we start making trouble,

02:08.628 --> 02:11.163
Hedwig and Eugene will
make trouble for us.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.165
That's the last thing we need.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.167
Exactly. We have to be smart.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.368
But I don't want that witch

02:16.437 --> 02:17.669
sleeping in Erik and Kate's bed.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.505
It's like they're taking their place.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.607
No one's taking Erik and Kate's place.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.709
They'll be back soon. (sighs)

02:23.777 --> 02:25.978
All we have to do is wait
for Saganash to call.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.814
In the meantime, we all need
to be on our best behavior.

Exactly, yeah, he was the gemstonium.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.730
Dominus, it's Latin for,
uh, gemstone master.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.366
I guess that explains his outfit.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.567
(Tess) I know, right?

13:22.636 --> 13:25.403
Who else in Amsterdam
wears a hood and cape?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.738
I'm gonna take this fake

13:26.807 --> 13:28.473
to the police station for safekeeping.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.375
Well, there's no need, I mean... No...

13:30.443 --> 13:32.443
We can... we can take care of that.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.812
Yes. I assure you.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.648
You're here to watch the
kids, not their belongings.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.882
Any questions?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.152
I guess it's good night, then.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.125
(door closes) How dare
you steal from us.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.560
You will pay for this.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.928
Keep the change.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.305
(phone sounds)

14:09.749 --> 14:11.182
(sighs)

14:11.251 --> 14:13.818
Texting, when you should be working.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.855
Where do you think you are?

14:16.923 --> 14:18.389
Hanging out with your friends?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.824
Definitely not.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.626
Well, maybe this will teach you

14:21.695 --> 14:24.329
not to steal valuables from our house.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.464
This isn't your house.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.933
It's Erik and Kate's house.
It's our house!

14:29.002 --> 14:30.802
Oh, what are you gonna do?

14:30.871 --> 14:32.971
Attack me with a toothbrush?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.874
One more stunt like that, brat,

14:35.942 --> 14:40.378
and you will end up in...
the orphanage.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.846
Now get back to work.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.725
(birds chirping)

14:56.263 --> 14:58.129
(whispering) So now what?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.331
We give 'em the real diamond.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.168
Ugh, no, Kate and Erik
specifically use a fake.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.870
We're gonna do what they say.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.839
(snoring)

15:07.908 --> 15:11.776
Okay, so we have to get the
fake diamond back from Simone.

15:11.845 --> 15:15.113
Sounds like a job for
the man of her dreams.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.481
Tim? How's he gonna help?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.750
Anika! Simone's crazy about Tim.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.518
I can't be the only one who's noticed.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.086
It's true.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.489
There's no point in lying to myself.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.556
(whistle blows)

15:25.625 --> 15:26.891
Silence!

15:26.960 --> 15:30.028
All present and accounted for.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.298
We'll start this morning
with calisthenics.

15:33.366 --> 15:38.403
Shake out the cobwebs before
your morning gruel, huh?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.571
What don't you shake
your own cobwebs, Gene?

15:40.640 --> 15:42.774
Maximilian?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.609
The latrine.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.445
With your toothbrush.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.613
On the double!

15:48.682 --> 15:50.481
(snickers)

15:50.550 --> 15:53.151
Joke's on you... Gene.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.586
My toothbrush is officially retired.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.822
Oh, I see.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.490
We do have a problem.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.493
So I guess I'm... off the hook.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.829
Tess?

16:04.898 --> 16:09.767
Am I correct that you wear
eye makeup sometimes?

16:09.836 --> 16:12.236
Um, yes, why?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.309
♪♪

16:20.780 --> 16:23.314
Hi, Daniel, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.718
Tim wants to see me?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.720
Simone wants a what?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.955
How do you... She told you.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.459
Wait, why are <i> you</i> telling me this?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.461
<i>(distant voice over phone)</i>

16:39.165 --> 16:40.832
He is kind of shy, isn't he?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.734
Police station, tonight, right.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.003
Got it. I'll be there.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.405
Well, thanks for calling, Daniel.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.640
<i>Thanks.</i> Yes, yeah...

16:49.709 --> 16:50.842
<i>Bye. (beeping)</i>

16:50.910 --> 16:53.644
Okay, bye, Simone.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.948
That was awful.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.649
You were so good.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.051
Yeah.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.555
Look who I found sound asleep
with his head on the toi...

17:04.624 --> 17:06.424
toilet seat. (clears throat)

17:06.492 --> 17:08.492
We wanted to give you your brush back.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.261
(Max) Thanks, Tess.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.662
Oh, thanks.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.232
The plan is working, you guys.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.566
Daniel set up a date for Simone

17:15.635 --> 17:17.734
so we can steal the fake diamond back.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.569
Great, Anika.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.707
But, uh, I think you
should do it without me.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.510
Gene and Hedy are gonna be
watching me like a movie.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.744
Until Erik and Kate come back,

17:27.814 --> 17:30.081
I'm gonna do everything they want.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.475
Shh.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.883
Seriously?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.654
Very seriously.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.458
No one's taking any valuables...

18:13.526 --> 18:14.959
<i>Our</i> valuables.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.494
...from this house.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.895
(door opens)

18:17.964 --> 18:19.297
(Eugene) What was that?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.039
(door squeaks open)

18:30.677 --> 18:32.310
(Hedwig) Be careful, Eugene.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.313
Oh, whoever's in there
better be careful.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.382
These hands are deadly weapons.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.187
(Tess laughs)

18:46.259 --> 18:47.425
Good evening, Gene.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.794
You insolent brat!

18:51.131 --> 18:52.797
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

18:52.866 --> 18:53.898
Oh, Eugene!

18:53.967 --> 18:56.067
Oh!

18:56.136 --> 18:57.268
(all laughing)

18:57.337 --> 19:00.605
(Eugene and Hedwig groaning)

19:00.673 --> 19:01.806
(all laughing)

19:01.875 --> 19:04.842
You wanted a clean floor.
How's that for clean?

19:04.911 --> 19:07.044
You little monster!

19:08.548 --> 19:09.780
Enjoy your evening.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.915
You're finished!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.550
You're going to Blackfriars.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.285
Do you hear me?!

19:14.354 --> 19:15.520
I thought you'd given up.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.921
Hunters never give up.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.923
Yeah, they don't. Whoo!

19:18.992 --> 19:21.425
Eugene, my back!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.027
My back!

19:25.665 --> 19:27.698
(Simone) Thanks for the invitation.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.867
No, thank you.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.370
Wait, you invited me, right?

19:32.438 --> 19:33.871
I did?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.541
I know, Daniel actually
made the call, but you...

19:36.609 --> 19:39.443
I thought it was a great idea.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.979
Whose idea?

19:42.048 --> 19:43.447
Your idea.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.317
You mean your idea.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.585
(chuckles)

19:47.654 --> 19:50.188
So... wanna grab a bite to eat?

19:50.256 --> 19:51.422
Definitely.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.424
When do you get off duty?

19:53.493 --> 19:56.360
Right... now.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.397
(both chuckling)

19:59.465 --> 20:01.866
There they go. Ahh... yes.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.769
(Sal) Yup, yup, yup, wait.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.103
(Anika) I have an idea how to get in.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.471
(Daniel) Wait, wait, go no, go now.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.945
Right there, it's right
there, right there.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.348
(Max) Where is it?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.157
(Sal) Hurry, somebody might be coming.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.225
(crosstalk) There it is.
Oh, there it is.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.826
She's got it. Yes.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.027
(Sal) Come on, please be the
diamond, please be the diamond.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.062
(all) Yes!

20:31.130 --> 20:32.096
Go, go, go, quick, quick.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.955
First you tell us where
our parents are.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.206
It's today's paper.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.278
It's definitely them.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.598
Wait, when do we get our parents back?!
