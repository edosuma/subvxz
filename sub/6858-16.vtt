00:17.684 --> 00:19.268
NARRATOR: Mystery on Mortis!

00:19.769 --> 00:22.771
Sent to discover the origin
of a mysterious distress call,

00:23.106 --> 00:26.775
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.736
are stranded on a distant planet.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.781
There, they discover three beings
more powerful with the Force

00:32.866 --> 00:35.242
than any Jedi have seen before.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.537
A father keeps a fragile balance
between his daughter,

00:38.621 --> 00:39.705
who allies with the light side,

00:40.206 --> 00:42.958
and the son,
who drifts ever closer to the dark.

00:44.294 --> 00:48.255
With his strength failing, the father asks
Anakin to stay and take his place,

00:48.715 --> 00:51.383
preserving the balance
between light and dark.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.304
But after passing a perilous test,
Skywalker refuses.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.349
Now, we find our heroes
about to depart for their journey home.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.518
Or so they think.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.493
SON: Anakin.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.661
Anakin.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.330
Anakin?

01:21.664 --> 01:22.664
(GASPING)

01:35.053 --> 01:37.346
It's true, what they say.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.140
You are the Chosen One.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.477
Join me.

01:44.020 --> 01:48.023
Together we can change
the balance of the universe,

01:48.650 --> 01:51.235
my friend.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.155
You must know
I will never join the dark side willingly.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.866
How simple you make it.

01:58.326 --> 02:03.038
Light and dark,
as if there is one without the other.

02:04.082 --> 02:09.336
Aligned, you and I can restore balance
wherever we go.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.256
Peace to the universe.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.007
By becoming a Sith?

02:14.384 --> 02:15.509
Never!

02:16.719 --> 02:19.721
We will destroy the Sith!

02:20.431 --> 02:22.558
And the Jedi.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.812
(ROARING)

02:32.569 --> 02:34.319
-Were you having a nightmare?
-(SIGHING)

02:34.946 --> 02:36.572
Something like that.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.784
If you're done napping,
I could use a little help here.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.952
I'm coming.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.412
(AHSOKA GRUNTING)

02:47.125 --> 02:48.750
Leaving so soon?

02:49.419 --> 02:51.128
Not without this, you won't.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.424
Ahsoka!

02:55.967 --> 02:56.967
(SCREAMING)

02:59.762 --> 03:02.139
-What's going on?
-The son took Ahsoka.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.099
What in the blazes are you talking about?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.434
Move! Let me fly!

03:51.189 --> 03:52.439
Look out!

04:12.835 --> 04:14.086
I didn't think you saw it.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.089
It was a giant tower! Of course I saw it!

04:24.013 --> 04:25.514
Any sign of him?

04:26.182 --> 04:30.060
No. But I think it's obvious
where he's taken her.

04:34.857 --> 04:38.318
-We must hurry.
-Anakin, this wasn't a mistake.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.863
He brought us here for a reason.
We must not get involved.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.659
Any conflict here could have dramatic
repercussions for the universe at large.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.746
I don't care. He's too powerful for Ahsoka.
I won't leave her alone.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.625
We are in the middle of something
we don't truly understand.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.836
We'd be wise
to confer with the father first.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.504
There's no time.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.090
This is what he wants, to divide us.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.301
It's my fault he took her!

05:02.385 --> 05:06.096
You must feel how strong this part
of the planet is with the dark side.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.098
The father will know what to do.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.933
He can't help us.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.525
You cannot keep me here!

05:19.485 --> 05:20.569
You hear me?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.112
Save your energy.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.407
You have been left to die.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.243
Then I will escape!

05:28.494 --> 05:29.828
Impossible.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.708
I have been here for more years
than I care to remember.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.754
I am a Jedi. We don't give up easily.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.797
Jedi?

05:40.882 --> 05:41.882
Hm.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.552
But so young. Where is your master?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.265
He will come for me.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.810
And if he does not?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.187
He will!

05:55.688 --> 05:57.939
What makes you so sure?

06:02.111 --> 06:03.487
Thank you.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.364
The chains.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.866
The chains are the easy part.

06:08.659 --> 06:12.371
It's what goes on in here that's hard.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.748
Don't you see, child?

06:15.166 --> 06:18.126
You are alone now.

06:18.669 --> 06:23.965
If you are to survive,
you must forget your master.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.300
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

06:25.510 --> 06:26.885
I don't think I...

06:27.970 --> 06:28.970
Ow!

06:30.056 --> 06:31.390
What have you done?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.851
You are mine now.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.292
Anakin, always on the move.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.295
How do I even find the father?

07:20.022 --> 07:22.691
You are growing stronger, my son.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.068
Am I, Father?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.114
Vanity, however,
is getting the better of you.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.949
How so?

07:31.617 --> 07:34.202
You have done what is forbidden.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.374
You have chosen the dark side

07:39.500 --> 07:43.003
and allowed it to feed your anger
and desire for power.

07:43.087 --> 07:46.965
By bringing the Chosen One here,
you've shown me my potential.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.925
You've only yourself to blame.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.635
Do not do this, Son.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.180
Do not become what you should not.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.140
Be strong, I implore you,

07:55.808 --> 07:58.310
or else I will be forced to contain you.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.396
You look frail, Father.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.732
I am not dead yet.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.321
Well, perhaps I am tired of waiting!

08:11.949 --> 08:14.201
I hate you!

08:21.501 --> 08:22.918
DAUGHTER: Father!

08:47.109 --> 08:48.485
We will leave him to rest.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.237
I must talk to him.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.740
-Not until he's stronger.
-But your brother is losing himself

08:53.824 --> 08:55.075
to the dark side.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.660
He's taken our friend.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.745
Then he must have his reasons.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.207
The same reason he had for
attempting to murder your father?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.917
He would never do such a thing.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.460
But I saw him.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.045
It is not his fault.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.798
My nature is to do what is selfless,

09:09.924 --> 09:12.634
but my brother's will always be
to do what is selfish.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.387
Then know you must help us.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.557
I cannot interfere
with the ways of the Force.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.891
My father forbids it.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.813
Your brother will flee this place
and wreak havoc on the universe.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.441
You and Anakin combined
have the power to stop him.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.737
Come with me.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.784
I can go no further.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.288
When you reach the altar,
it will give you what you need.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.915
I don't understand.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.462
He who wields the blade
will be able to control my brother.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.349
Ahsoka.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.644
Ahsoka!

11:27.853 --> 11:29.896
It's me. You're safe now. Let's go.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.234
Are you proud of me, Master?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.319
What?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.531
Of course, Snips.
Of course I'm proud of you.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.907
Now let's get out of here.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.868
He's right.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.829
Right about everything.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.248
You must join him.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.710
He only wants what's best for the universe.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.087
Hey, what's wrong with you?

11:54.422 --> 11:57.340
Always with the criticism, Master.

11:57.675 --> 12:01.803
Never really believing in me, trusting me.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.348
Well, I don't need you anymore.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.309
Ahsoka. Ahsoka, listen to me.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.979
He has done something to you.
Snap out of it!

12:11.063 --> 12:13.356
-This isn't you, Ahsoka!
-Isn't it?

12:14.024 --> 12:16.526
I feel more like myself than I ever have.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.571
He asked me to give you a message.

12:20.364 --> 12:23.199
He said if you don't join him,

12:23.534 --> 12:25.285
he will kill me.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.120
I won't let him.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.831
Then you will be forced to kill me!

12:56.734 --> 13:00.403
Sister! What a pleasant surprise.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.655
And you brought a friend.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.783
What have you done, Brother?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.367
Done?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.537
I have done what is right.

13:10.414 --> 13:14.125
Or what is wrong,
depending on your point of view.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.877
Our father is dying.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.712
Did you do it?

13:18.255 --> 13:22.842
He is just so selfish
and was taking too long to die,

13:23.928 --> 13:26.095
so I decided to move things along.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.724
Now, why are you here?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.935
I won't let you leave this planet.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.271
You are not strong enough
to keep me here.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.232
Not alone, she isn't.

13:37.566 --> 13:42.070
Are you referring to your friend,
the Chosen One?

13:42.863 --> 13:44.823
You might want to check up on him.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.534
He's a little preoccupied right now.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.331
I don't want to fight you, Ahsoka.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.091
And now the student will kill the master.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.933
Getting ahead of yourself,
aren't you, Snips?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.685
Don't call me that!

14:13.936 --> 14:15.270
I hate it when you call me that!

14:26.782 --> 14:29.784
Two Jedi. Finally, a challenge.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.794
Can you feel it, Sister?

14:40.629 --> 14:43.631
Can you feel the anger?

14:44.091 --> 14:47.552
The hate? The fury?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.471
Their conflict is feeding you, isn't it?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.473
I must stop them.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.225
No!

15:06.155 --> 15:08.323
If you will stand in my way,

15:09.116 --> 15:10.992
then I guess we must fight.

15:31.513 --> 15:35.016
-Any suggestions?
-Yes! We cut her free!

15:37.186 --> 15:39.562
-What is that?
-It can kill the son.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.523
Where did you get that?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.068
Give it to me!

16:04.213 --> 16:05.672
You don't have to do this!

16:06.256 --> 16:07.882
Then stand aside!

16:11.929 --> 16:13.096
I can't.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.555
I won't!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.930
Stop this!

17:05.441 --> 17:08.568
So glad you could make it
to our little party, Father.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.655
You will stop this!

17:14.408 --> 17:16.993
You are too weak for me, old man.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.454
You mean nothing to me anymore.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.348
Anakin! Now!

17:48.150 --> 17:52.695
Everything has transpired
exactly as I planned.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.824
You showed them the altar?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.871
I am sorry, Father.
I didn't know how else to stop him.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.332
Give it to me, child.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.668
Ahsoka, no.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.011
Thank you.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.514
Your usefulness has come to an end.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.349
(WHOOSHING)

18:23.977 --> 18:25.520
No!

18:27.648 --> 18:30.358
The Jedi have brought me the dagger,

18:30.484 --> 18:33.319
and you have brought yourself.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.571
Now, Father,

18:36.698 --> 18:38.366
you will die.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.535
Father!

18:46.875 --> 18:47.875
(GASPING)

18:48.001 --> 18:49.502
Why?

19:05.352 --> 19:08.271
My daughter, what have I done?

19:10.607 --> 19:12.233
Do not hate him, Father.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.779
It is his nature.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.573
No!

19:19.283 --> 19:20.700
All is lost.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.120
The balance has been broken.

19:25.038 --> 19:28.082
I thought by bringing you here I would...

19:29.042 --> 19:30.918
But I have destroyed everything.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.965
Can you help her?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.259
There is no light.

19:38.427 --> 19:42.889
The evil has been unleashed,
and the dark side shall consume her.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.599
You must help her!

19:45.100 --> 19:46.934
I cannot undo what is done.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.478
There is no hope.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.939
Yes, there is! There's always hope!

20:17.841 --> 20:19.800
Then let my daughter's last act

20:21.261 --> 20:23.471
be to breathe life into your friend.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.658
(COUGHING)

20:48.747 --> 20:49.956
Hey, Snips.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.667
What's going on?

20:54.962 --> 20:55.962
Uh...

20:56.255 --> 20:57.463
Not much.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.798
It's good to see you.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.471
As the balance in this world crumbles,

21:06.014 --> 21:08.683
so shall war escalate in your galaxy.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.646
As my son has descended
into the dark side,

21:14.022 --> 21:16.357
so have the Sith gained strength.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.859
-We will stop your son.
-No!

21:19.486 --> 21:21.195
You must go, now!

21:21.822 --> 21:23.990
