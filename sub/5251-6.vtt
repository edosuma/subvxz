WEBVTT

00:03.767 --> 00:04.767
>> WOMAN: Who's more attracted

00:04.767 --> 00:06.233
to men?

00:06.233 --> 00:08.233
Raise your hand.

00:08.233 --> 00:09.233
>> JENNY: Is that a hand?

00:09.233 --> 00:10.500
>> CAITLYN: I-I don't know.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.767
You would feel so much more

00:11.767 --> 00:13.233
feminine if you were with a guy,

00:13.233 --> 00:14.233
you know?

00:14.233 --> 00:15.500
>> WOMAN 2: Wait, what?

00:15.500 --> 00:16.767
>> CAITLYN: I can appreciate the

00:16.767 --> 00:18.233
male form.

00:18.233 --> 00:19.233
You gonna date women?

00:19.233 --> 00:20.500
You gonna date men?

00:20.500 --> 00:24.233
I don't know.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.233
Candis and I are leaving

00:25.233 --> 00:26.233
together.

00:26.233 --> 00:27.233
(laughter)

00:27.233 --> 00:28.233
But we'll see you back in L.A.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.233
>> CANDIS: Love you, girls.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.233
>> ZACKARY: Bye.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.233
>> CHANDI: Bye, baby.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.233
Candis and Caitlyn in the tree,

00:33.233 --> 00:35.200
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

00:41.067 --> 00:44.067
(footsteps approaching)

00:44.067 --> 00:45.067
>> COURTNEY: All right, Johnie's

00:45.067 --> 00:46.733
coming to pick me up.

00:46.733 --> 00:47.733
Go easy on him.

00:47.733 --> 00:49.400
(Caitlyn laughs)

00:49.400 --> 00:51.733
If you know how to do that.

00:51.733 --> 00:52.733
Have you ever gone easy on

00:52.733 --> 00:53.733
anyone?

00:53.733 --> 00:54.733
>> CAITLYN: I, uh... No,

00:54.733 --> 00:55.733
actually, I haven't.

00:55.733 --> 00:56.733
>> COURTNEY: Oh.

00:56.733 --> 00:57.733
Well, it's... you know, you're

00:57.733 --> 00:58.733
doing new things now, so that

00:58.733 --> 00:59.733
might be one of them.

00:59.733 --> 01:00.800
>> CAITLYN: I know.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.133
(door opens, closes)

01:02.133 --> 01:03.133
(footsteps approaching)

01:03.133 --> 01:04.133
Uh-oh.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.133
>> JOHNIE: Hello.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.133
>> COURTNEY: Babes.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.133
>> CAITLYN: He's here.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.133
>> JOHNIE: I made it.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.133
>> CAITLYN: How you doing?

01:09.133 --> 01:10.133
>> JOHNIE: Good, how are you

01:10.133 --> 01:10.800
doing again?

01:10.800 --> 01:11.733
>> CAITLYN: I'm good.

01:11.733 --> 01:12.467
I'm doing good. How are you?

01:12.467 --> 01:13.467
>> JOHNIE: I'm fantastic.

01:13.467 --> 01:14.133
>> CAITLYN: Well, good.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.067
>> COURTNEY: Uh, hi.

01:15.067 --> 01:15.800
>> JOHNIE: What's been happening

01:15.800 --> 01:16.733
lately?

01:16.733 --> 01:17.467
>> CAITLYN: You came to pick her

01:17.467 --> 01:18.467
up?

01:18.467 --> 01:19.133
Oh, hi, yeah.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.133
Remember her?

01:20.133 --> 01:21.133
>> COURTNEY: Yeah, do you

01:21.133 --> 01:21.800
remember?

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
I think he's forgotten about me

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
since I haven't been around so

01:23.800 --> 01:24.467
much.

01:24.467 --> 01:25.467
>> CAITLYN: Really, you haven't

01:25.467 --> 01:26.133
been around much lately?

01:26.133 --> 01:27.133
>> JOHNIE: Yeah, she used to be

01:27.133 --> 01:28.133
home a few days a week, and now

01:28.133 --> 01:28.800
she's never home.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
>> CAITLYN: Never home?

01:29.800 --> 01:30.800
Well, you've got a working

01:30.800 --> 01:31.467
woman.

01:31.467 --> 01:32.467
Now, how did you two meet?

01:32.467 --> 01:34.133
>> COURTNEY: One of my good guy

01:34.133 --> 01:35.467
friends that I've known since

01:35.467 --> 01:38.467
third grade knows him, and he

01:38.467 --> 01:39.467
set us up.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.800
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, in the

01:40.800 --> 01:44.133
heterosexual dating world, it is

01:44.133 --> 01:46.467
nothing compared to what it is

01:46.467 --> 01:47.800
for people in the trans

01:47.800 --> 01:49.467
community.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.133
>> COURTNEY: Babe, what if you

01:51.133 --> 01:53.467
met someone, and you, like, were

01:53.467 --> 01:56.133
super into them, and you found

01:56.133 --> 01:58.800
out they were trans?

01:58.800 --> 02:01.533
>> JOHNIE: Like, how... how soon

02:01.533 --> 02:03.200
into the, you know, like,

02:03.200 --> 02:04.533
relationship courting does that

02:04.533 --> 02:05.533
come up?

02:05.533 --> 02:06.533
Because I believe that should be

02:06.533 --> 02:07.533
something that's kind of more

02:07.533 --> 02:08.533
up-front, otherwise it's sort

02:08.533 --> 02:10.200
of deceptive.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.200
>> COURTNEY: Why?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
Would it change?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
>> CAITLYN: You would have to be

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
honest right from the beginning.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
>> JOHNIE: Yeah, right from the

02:15.200 --> 02:15.867
start, you know?

02:15.867 --> 02:16.667
'Cause not telling someone...

02:16.667 --> 02:17.733
>> COURTNEY: Like, if I told you

02:17.733 --> 02:19.400
right now that I was trans, then

02:19.400 --> 02:20.533
you'd be like...

02:20.533 --> 02:21.533
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, what would you

02:21.533 --> 02:23.500
do?

02:26.867 --> 02:28.533
>> COURTNEY: Would it change us?

02:28.533 --> 02:30.200
>> JOHNIE: Yeah, but then, you

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
know, we can choose to continue

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
to be friends.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
>> COURTNEY: And would you

02:33.200 --> 02:33.867
continue?

02:33.867 --> 02:34.867
Oh, and be friends.

02:34.867 --> 02:35.867
You would continue and be

02:35.867 --> 02:36.867
friends.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.200
>> CAITLYN: He would dump you

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
like a hot potato, girl.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.200
>> JOHNIE: No. Well...

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
>> COURTNEY: Basically.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
Basically.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
>> CAITLYN: Who are you worried

02:43.200 --> 02:43.867
about?

02:43.867 --> 02:44.867
Is it other people, what

02:44.867 --> 02:45.867
their... they would think about

02:45.867 --> 02:46.867
you?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.533
>> JOHNIE: No, it's how you...

02:48.533 --> 02:50.500
how I perceive y-you.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.200
>> CAITLYN: I really appreciate

02:55.200 --> 02:57.533
Johnie's honesty, but this is a

02:57.533 --> 02:59.867
problem in the trans community.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.600
A lot of people are supportive,

03:01.600 --> 03:02.933
but when it starts to get a

03:02.933 --> 03:04.600
little too close, they have a

03:04.600 --> 03:06.267
hard time dealing with that.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.267
It's a big issue, if you...

03:07.267 --> 03:08.267
>> COURTNEY: What is the best

03:08.267 --> 03:09.267
way to go about it then if...

03:09.267 --> 03:10.267
>> CAITLYN: If you look at

03:10.267 --> 03:11.267
all of the girls, you know...

03:11.267 --> 03:12.600
>> COURTNEY: Right.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
>> CAITLYN: ...every one, hard

03:14.600 --> 03:16.267
time finding a date.

03:16.267 --> 03:18.267
I really can't even imagine

03:18.267 --> 03:19.267
dating or doing something like

03:19.267 --> 03:20.267
that.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.933
Uh, to me, it's absolutely

03:21.933 --> 03:23.600
overwhelming.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.267
It might be too much.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.267
>> JOHNIE: Well, as time goes

03:26.267 --> 03:27.700
on, more and more people will be

03:27.700 --> 03:29.600
open to that and understand that

03:29.600 --> 03:32.267
this is normal, this isn't some,

03:32.267 --> 03:34.600
you know, freaky thing, and a

03:34.600 --> 03:35.933
lot of people are like this, so,

03:35.933 --> 03:37.600
you know... but right now, it's

03:37.600 --> 03:38.933
still, it's an awkward

03:38.933 --> 03:40.900
situation.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.567
>> CAITLYN: Ta-da.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.533
Let's go get something to eat.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.900
>> CANDIS: Why, thank you.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.233
>> CAITLYN: You got it.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.567
With us, whose job is that?

04:03.567 --> 04:04.567
>> CANDIS: I-I think we have to

04:04.567 --> 04:05.567
trade off and on.

04:05.567 --> 04:06.567
>> CAITLYN: Uh, we trade off?

04:06.567 --> 04:07.567
Okay.

04:07.567 --> 04:08.567
>> CANDIS: We're out, and we're

04:08.567 --> 04:09.367
hungry.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.200
>> CAITLYN: I know.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.567
How exciting is this?

04:11.567 --> 04:12.267
>> CANDIS: I'm starving.

04:12.267 --> 04:12.967
>> CAITLYN: I know.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.900
Actually, I am starving too.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.233
>> WAITER: Here you go, ladies.

04:16.233 --> 04:19.233
>> CANDIS: That's perfect.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.233
>> CAITLYN: To a girls' lunch

04:20.233 --> 04:21.233
and, yeah.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.233
>> CANDIS: To a girls' lunch, my

04:22.233 --> 04:23.567
darling.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.567
(laughs)

04:25.567 --> 04:27.233
Thank you for picking me up.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.567
My car is on the fritz.

04:28.567 --> 04:29.900
Like, the computer and the dash

04:29.900 --> 04:31.567
completely went dead on me, and

04:31.567 --> 04:33.233
so, like, there's no blinker.

04:33.233 --> 04:34.233
>> CAITLYN: No way.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.233
>> CANDIS: So I have to, like,

04:35.233 --> 04:36.567
do hand signals. Yeah.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.567
>> CAITLYN: I think that's

04:37.567 --> 04:38.567
funny.

04:38.567 --> 04:39.567
>> CANDIS: It's, like, a

04:39.567 --> 04:40.567
ten-year-old car.

04:40.567 --> 04:41.567
I-I'm trying to decide if I want

04:41.567 --> 04:42.567
to fix this car...

04:42.567 --> 04:43.233
>> WAITER: Here you go.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.233
>> CAITLYN: You need, like, a

04:44.233 --> 04:44.900
Porsche or something.

04:44.900 --> 04:45.900
Maybe something hot.

04:45.900 --> 04:46.900
>> CANDIS: Can't really do that

04:46.900 --> 04:47.900
on my budget right now.

04:47.900 --> 04:48.900
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.233
Ooh, what do we got?

04:50.233 --> 04:52.567
>> CANDIS: So I have an audition

04:52.567 --> 04:53.567
coming up for a movie.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.567
Like, that's what I've been

04:54.567 --> 04:55.233
studying.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.200
>> CAITLYN: You do?

04:56.200 --> 04:56.900
>> CANDIS: Yeah. Katie Holmes.

04:56.900 --> 04:57.900
Do you know Katie Holmes?

04:57.900 --> 04:58.900
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

04:58.900 --> 04:59.900
>> CANDIS: Put in a good word.

04:59.900 --> 05:00.967
>> CAITLYN: Tom Cruise.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.300
(Candis laughs)

05:02.300 --> 05:03.633
In my minimal experience with

05:03.633 --> 05:04.633
acting...

05:04.633 --> 05:05.633
>> CANDIS: Yes.

05:05.633 --> 05:06.933
>> CAITLYN: ...I actually

05:06.933 --> 05:08.633
enjoyed the process.

05:08.633 --> 05:09.967
What I didn't enjoy is the

05:09.967 --> 05:11.633
process of getting the work.

05:11.633 --> 05:12.967
That sucked.

05:12.967 --> 05:13.967
>> CANDIS: It does suck.

05:13.967 --> 05:14.967
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

05:14.967 --> 05:15.967
>> CANDIS: It's nerve-racking,

05:15.967 --> 05:16.967
having people judging you, and

05:16.967 --> 05:18.300
being trans and judging you...

05:18.300 --> 05:19.133
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

05:19.133 --> 05:19.900
>> CANDIS: ...there's always

05:19.900 --> 05:23.300
that little extra...

05:23.300 --> 05:25.067
you know...

05:25.067 --> 05:27.967
insecurity there, you know?

05:27.967 --> 05:28.967
>> CAITLYN: You were the only

05:28.967 --> 05:29.967
reason I watched Dirty Sexy

05:29.967 --> 05:31.967
Money.

05:31.967 --> 05:32.967
>> CANDIS: Thanks.

05:32.967 --> 05:33.967
>> CAITLYN: I said, "Who is this

05:33.967 --> 05:34.967
little trans girl?"

05:34.967 --> 05:35.967
(Candis laughs)

05:35.967 --> 05:37.633
It was a big deal that... Billy

05:37.633 --> 05:38.633
Baldwin, right?

05:38.633 --> 05:39.633
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

05:39.633 --> 05:40.633
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, he

05:40.633 --> 05:41.633
kissed the trans woman.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.633
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.633
>> CAITLYN: I...

05:43.633 --> 05:44.967
You were hot as hell.

05:44.967 --> 05:45.967
Why wouldn't he?

05:45.967 --> 05:46.967
(Candis laughs)

05:46.967 --> 05:49.300
>> CANDIS: I've never not been a

05:49.300 --> 05:51.300
performer; it's part my soul,

05:51.300 --> 05:52.300
you know, and it's something

05:52.300 --> 05:53.633
that I have to do.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.300
However, it's been a struggle to

05:56.300 --> 06:00.700
get the respect, um, from...

06:00.700 --> 06:02.700
producers, directors, casting

06:02.700 --> 06:04.233
agents.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.067
And I put up this front

06:06.067 --> 06:09.067
all the time because I have to

06:09.067 --> 06:11.700
be the one on top who people

06:11.700 --> 06:14.067
look up to for my community, and

06:14.067 --> 06:16.333
it's been hard, it's been hard.

06:18.367 --> 06:19.367
>> CAITLYN: Going over to the

06:19.367 --> 06:20.067
health center?

06:20.067 --> 06:21.067
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:21.067 --> 06:21.700
>> CAITLYN: After this?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.600
That should be good.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.367
That'll be very interesting.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.367
>> CANDIS: I got an

06:24.367 --> 06:25.067
appointment; it was, like, a

06:25.067 --> 06:26.067
three-month wait, and so I was

06:26.067 --> 06:26.700
like...

06:26.700 --> 06:27.700
>> CAITLYN: Get out of here.

06:27.700 --> 06:28.367
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.367
And so, um, I mean, I have a

06:29.367 --> 06:32.067
family doctor, but, uh, I find

06:32.067 --> 06:33.700
it really hard to get the right

06:33.700 --> 06:36.367
medication, so I just want to go

06:36.367 --> 06:37.367
to somebody that knows what

06:37.367 --> 06:38.367
they're doing, you know...

06:38.367 --> 06:39.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, right.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.067
>> CANDIS: ...when it comes to

06:40.067 --> 06:40.700
our issues.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.633
>> CAITLYN: I'd like to see it.

06:41.633 --> 06:42.367
>> CANDIS: I would love for you

06:42.367 --> 06:43.367
to come with me.

06:43.367 --> 06:44.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.067
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:45.067 --> 06:48.067
So who gets the check?

06:48.067 --> 06:49.067
>> CAITLYN: Here's the deal.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.067
(Candis laughs)

06:50.067 --> 06:51.067
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.067
(Caitlyn chuckles)

06:52.067 --> 06:53.067
>> CAITLYN: I opened the door

06:53.067 --> 06:54.067
for you coming in...

06:54.067 --> 06:55.067
(Candis laughs)

06:55.067 --> 06:56.067
>> CANDIS: Damn!

06:56.067 --> 06:57.067
Okay, I'll get the check, then

06:57.067 --> 06:59.067
you get the car.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.100
>> CAITLYN: Well, no.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.767
No.

07:01.767 --> 07:04.433
So, actually, if I got the door,

07:04.433 --> 07:05.433
I opened the door for you.

07:05.433 --> 07:06.433
>> CANDIS: Right.

07:06.433 --> 07:07.433
>> CAITLYN: That means that I

07:07.433 --> 07:08.767
should also pick the check up.

07:08.767 --> 07:09.767
>> CANDIS: No.

07:09.767 --> 07:10.767
>> CAITLYN: Why not?

07:10.767 --> 07:11.767
>> CANDIS: Because you're used

07:11.767 --> 07:12.767
to picking up the check.

07:12.767 --> 07:13.767
Just once you should have the

07:13.767 --> 07:15.100
check picked up for you.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.100
>> CAITLYN: This whole dating

07:16.100 --> 07:17.100
thing is getting so complicated.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
>> CANDIS: It's so confusing

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
with two girls.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
>> CAITLYN: It's so confusing.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.100
I just don't know how to do it

07:21.100 --> 07:23.067
all.

07:26.733 --> 07:27.733
>> RECEPTIONIST: Welcome to the

07:27.733 --> 07:28.567
L.A. LGBT Center.

07:28.567 --> 07:29.400
How can I help you?

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
I just need to register.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.400
>> RECEPTIONIST: Just go ahead

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
and start filling out this piece

07:33.400 --> 07:34.067
of paperwork.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.067
Have a seat, and the doctor will

07:35.067 --> 07:36.067
be with you soon, okay?

07:36.067 --> 07:37.067
>> CANDIS: Okay. Thank you.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.067
>> CAITLYN: There's always

07:38.067 --> 07:39.067
paperwork, isn't there?

07:39.067 --> 07:40.633
>> CANDIS: Always paperwork.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.400
"Emergency contact."

07:42.400 --> 07:45.400
Ouch.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
>> CAITLYN: Put me down.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.733
>> CANDIS: Okay.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.067
The lover.

07:49.067 --> 07:51.067
(both laugh)

07:51.067 --> 07:53.067
>> CAITLYN: "I consider myself

07:53.067 --> 07:55.400
gay, bisexual, heterosexual,

07:55.400 --> 07:56.733
lesbian, questioning."

07:56.733 --> 07:57.733
Questioning.

07:57.733 --> 07:58.733
(Candis laughs)

07:58.733 --> 07:59.733
>> CANDIS: Questioning.

07:59.733 --> 08:00.800
>> NURSE: Candis?

08:00.800 --> 08:01.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.467
>> NURSE: Come on back.

08:02.467 --> 08:03.133
>> CANDIS: Okay, great.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.133
>> NURSE: Come on in.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.133
First stop is gonna be, uh, on

08:05.133 --> 08:05.800
the scale.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
>> CANDIS: Oh, God, no, not the

08:06.800 --> 08:07.467
scale.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.467
>> NURSE: The scale.

08:08.467 --> 08:09.467
>> CANDIS: Don't you dare film

08:09.467 --> 08:11.133
this goddamn scale.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.133
Don't say it out loud.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.133
>> NURSE: Okay, perfect.

08:13.133 --> 08:16.800
(Candis laughs)

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
>> CAITLYN: I won't tell.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
>> CANDIS: I caught you.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.133
>> NURSE: So come on in.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.800
>> CANDIS: I'm a good 15 pounds

08:22.800 --> 08:24.800
heavier than I want to be.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
>> NURSE: I'll have the doctor

08:25.800 --> 08:26.800
come right in.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
>> CANDIS: Okay, thank you so

08:27.800 --> 08:29.467
much.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.800
>> CAITLYN: The doctor's coming

08:30.800 --> 08:31.800
in; shouldn't you, like, put a

08:31.800 --> 08:32.800
gown on?

08:32.800 --> 08:34.133
(Candis laughs)

08:34.133 --> 08:36.133
Yeah, that green thing.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.133
>> CANDIS: I remember when I

08:37.133 --> 08:38.800
first started transition, it was

08:38.800 --> 08:40.800
like, you'd go to these doctors,

08:40.800 --> 08:41.800
and nobody... You'd have to,

08:41.800 --> 08:43.800
like, sit in a room and say,

08:43.800 --> 08:45.800
"I'm trans," and half of them

08:45.800 --> 08:47.133
would be like, "Oh, I'm sorry,"

08:47.133 --> 08:48.133
and the other half would be

08:48.133 --> 08:49.133
like, "Well, I need to do a

08:49.133 --> 08:50.133
physical on you right now."

08:50.133 --> 08:51.133
>> CAITLYN: Oh, wow.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.133
>> CANDIS: And I was like,

08:52.133 --> 08:52.800
"Okay," you know?

08:52.800 --> 08:53.800
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, what do you

08:53.800 --> 08:54.467
know?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.467
>> CANDIS: And I got totally

08:55.467 --> 08:56.900
fondled by some doctor.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.633
>> CAITLYN: It's shocking to me.

08:58.633 --> 09:00.100
I can't believe some people

09:00.100 --> 09:01.800
would act that way.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.533
Especially a person in the

09:03.533 --> 09:04.833
medical field.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.100
>> CANDIS: The good old days.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.300
>> CAITLYN: Nasty.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.300
(knocking)

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
>> CARPENTER: Hello.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
>> CANDIS: Hi.

09:10.300 --> 09:10.967
>> CARPENTER: How are you?

09:10.967 --> 09:11.700
I'm Dr. Carpenter.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.700
>> CANDIS: Good. Candis.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.700
Nice to meet you.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.567
>> CARPENTER: Hi. How are you?

09:14.567 --> 09:15.233
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn.

09:15.233 --> 09:16.233
Dr. Carpenter, how are you?

09:16.233 --> 09:17.233
>> CARPENTER: So nice to meet

09:17.233 --> 09:18.233
you.

09:18.233 --> 09:20.100
So, in terms of your treatment,

09:20.100 --> 09:21.933
do you feel like things are...

09:21.933 --> 09:23.500
have been going well for you?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.500
>> CANDIS: I have a doctor that

09:24.500 --> 09:25.900
I've been like, "Oh, I'm a trans

09:25.900 --> 09:27.533
woman," and, you know, tests my

09:27.533 --> 09:29.633
hormones and makes sure I'm, you

09:29.633 --> 09:31.267
know, on the right dosage and

09:31.267 --> 09:32.667
stuff, but he doesn't really

09:32.667 --> 09:33.900
come from a place of knowledge

09:33.900 --> 09:34.967
in that, so...

09:34.967 --> 09:36.167
>> CARPENTER: Right.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.267
>> CANDIS: Dosing myself for so

09:37.267 --> 09:38.533
many years, I've come to an idea

09:38.533 --> 09:39.533
of what I'm supposed to take,

09:39.533 --> 09:40.533
you know?

09:40.533 --> 09:41.533
>> CARPENTER: And you shouldn't

09:41.533 --> 09:42.200
have to.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.200
>> CANDIS: And I shouldn't

09:43.200 --> 09:43.867
have to.

09:43.867 --> 09:44.867
>> CARPENTER: Because you should

09:44.867 --> 09:45.867
have doctors who are able to

09:45.867 --> 09:47.200
take care of you and know how to

09:47.200 --> 09:49.067
help you and know where you are.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.600
And, you know, it's a big

09:50.600 --> 09:52.067
problem between surgeons and

09:52.067 --> 09:54.067
hormone doctors, there aren't a

09:54.067 --> 09:55.833
lot of people who do it.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.633
Here we have people coming from

09:57.633 --> 09:59.200
sometimes Las Vegas, sometimes

09:59.200 --> 10:01.167
Phoenix, driving in because Los

10:01.167 --> 10:02.900
Angeles is the closest place

10:02.900 --> 10:04.033
they can come.

10:04.033 --> 10:05.100
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.100
And for somebody in Oklahoma,

10:06.100 --> 10:07.700
they probably don't have...

10:07.700 --> 10:08.900
>> CARPENTER: There's nobody.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.100
>> CANDIS: There's nobody.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.100
>> CARPENTER: There's nobody.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.067
There is literally nobody.

10:23.700 --> 10:24.867
(ringtone playing)

10:24.867 --> 10:25.867
>> CAITLYN: Well...

10:25.867 --> 10:26.867
>> MAN: Who's that?

10:26.867 --> 10:27.867
>> COURTNEY: Your girlfriend.

10:27.867 --> 10:28.867
>> CAITLYN: (laughs) Yeah.

10:28.867 --> 10:29.867
>> CANDIS: Hello, gorgeous.

10:29.867 --> 10:30.867
>> COURTNEY: Hi, Candis.

10:30.867 --> 10:31.867
>> MAN: Candis!

10:31.867 --> 10:32.867
>> CAITLYN: Hey, how are you

10:32.867 --> 10:34.033
doing?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.700
>> CANDIS: Hey, I'm doing good.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.533
I was about to go do some

10:37.533 --> 10:38.967
errands and stuff like that and

10:38.967 --> 10:40.500
I was just thinking, like, what

10:40.500 --> 10:42.100
you were doing this weekend.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.533
We could have, like, a girls'

10:43.533 --> 10:45.367
night, but not, like, at the

10:45.367 --> 10:46.900
house, but, like, get you out

10:46.900 --> 10:47.900
maybe.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.900
>> COURTNEY: Yes!

10:48.900 --> 10:49.900
>> MAN: I like the way this

10:49.900 --> 10:50.900
sounds, Candis!

10:50.900 --> 10:51.900
>> CAITLYN: What are we

10:51.900 --> 10:52.900
talking-- "out"?

10:52.900 --> 10:53.900
>> CANDIS: Let's go to The Abbey

10:53.900 --> 10:54.900
in the middle of...

10:54.900 --> 10:56.167
>> MAN: Oh, my God, yes!

10:56.167 --> 10:57.233
>> CANDIS: I think it will be

10:57.233 --> 10:58.400
fun, because it's kind of like

10:58.400 --> 10:59.567
it's a mixed night where

10:59.567 --> 11:01.300
there's, like, gay and lesbian

11:01.300 --> 11:02.700
and straight people there.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.400
>> MAN: That sounds perfect.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.933
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.533
That's awfully public.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.733
>> MAN: But that's, like, the

11:08.733 --> 11:09.767
perfect place to go.

11:09.767 --> 11:10.767
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.133
>> COURTNEY: You might find a

11:12.133 --> 11:13.433
girlfriend, a boyfriend.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.567
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no, that is not

11:14.567 --> 11:16.067
where I'm going here.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.500
They have to realize that it's

11:17.500 --> 11:18.900
been, like, a month or two now

11:18.900 --> 11:20.400
that I've been out, so I

11:20.400 --> 11:22.233
honestly haven't even thought or

11:22.233 --> 11:24.867
been approached or been tempted

11:24.867 --> 11:27.800
in any direction.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.367
Scares me to death.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.867
It's kind of like getting fed to

11:30.867 --> 11:32.500
the wolves.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.667
>> COURTNEY: When have you ever

11:33.667 --> 11:35.633
not just gone for it?

11:35.633 --> 11:37.567
Candis, she'll be there.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.533
>> CANDIS: All right.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.100
>> CAITLYN: This place really

11:52.100 --> 11:54.100
scares me.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.100
Hey!

11:55.100 --> 11:56.100
>> JEN: Whew!

11:56.100 --> 11:57.100
Look at that dress!

11:57.100 --> 11:58.333
>> CAITLYN: Hi, baby.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.333
>> JEN: I love that dress.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.467
>> CAITLYN: I'm trying to keep

12:00.467 --> 12:01.533
up with you.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.467
How are you, baby?

12:03.467 --> 12:04.533
>> WOMAN: Oh, good to see you.

12:04.533 --> 12:05.533
>> COURTNEY: Wait a minute!

12:05.533 --> 12:06.533
>> CAITLYN: What? What? What?

12:06.533 --> 12:07.533
>> COURTNEY: We're moving to the

12:07.533 --> 12:08.533
dance floor.

12:08.533 --> 12:09.533
>> CANDIS: We're making a move,

12:09.533 --> 12:10.800
Cait.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
>> COURTNEY: Candis has you.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.067
She's a professional.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.500
>> CAITLYN: You've got my back?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.533
It's hard for me to go to a

12:15.533 --> 12:16.900
place like The Abbey and have

12:16.900 --> 12:18.733
"fun," you know?

12:18.733 --> 12:19.900
I-I always feel like I'm on

12:19.900 --> 12:21.400
display.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.467
And I know what they're gonna

12:22.467 --> 12:23.467
try to do.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.600
They'll try to get me to dance.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.633
You know, it's just not

12:26.633 --> 12:28.133
comfortable.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.167
Oh, no!

12:29.167 --> 12:30.400
This is horrible.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.067
>> CANDIS: No, it's fabulous.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.133
Just go with it.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.133
>> CAITLYN: Those guys aren't

12:34.133 --> 12:35.133
dressed.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.567
>> CANDIS: Go with it.

12:36.567 --> 12:37.933
(Caitlyn sighs)

12:37.933 --> 12:39.067
>> CAITLYN: It's not really my

12:39.067 --> 12:40.367
style.

12:40.367 --> 12:41.467
The girls, they say, "Come on,

12:41.467 --> 12:42.700
you got to do it," but it just

12:42.700 --> 12:44.233
like, oh, God.

12:44.233 --> 12:45.267
I don't think I need this in my

12:45.267 --> 12:46.533
life.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.267
*

12:50.267 --> 12:51.667
>> CAITLYN: I think all the guys

12:51.667 --> 12:52.900
are stuffing.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.400
(laughter)

12:54.400 --> 12:56.067
>> CANDIS: Oh, we got one girl.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.833
>> MAN: There are a lot of

12:57.833 --> 12:59.200
penises and boobs.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.400
>> COURTNEY: Oh, my God!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.067
Look at her!

13:02.067 --> 13:03.200
>> CAITLYN: Whoa!

13:03.200 --> 13:05.167
>> MAN: She's going for it.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.733
>> CANDIS: I think that Cait is

13:10.733 --> 13:13.700
probably... my gut says that she

13:13.700 --> 13:15.300
is attracted to women.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.300
>> COURTNEY: There goes your

13:16.300 --> 13:18.267
girlfriend!

13:22.067 --> 13:23.867
>> CANDIS: I think she's

13:23.867 --> 13:25.633
attracted to women, because

13:25.633 --> 13:27.133
she's been married to a woman

13:27.133 --> 13:28.867
three times and she's lived her

13:28.867 --> 13:30.833
whole life with women.

13:30.833 --> 13:33.067
I can't imagine Cait deciding to

13:33.067 --> 13:34.633
transition and then go with

13:34.633 --> 13:36.367
guys.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.567
Your sexuality and your gender

13:37.567 --> 13:38.567
are two totally different

13:38.567 --> 13:39.567
things.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.800
Although, if she decides to

13:40.800 --> 13:42.200
venture off, it's nobody's

13:42.200 --> 13:43.933
(bleep) business but hers.

13:43.933 --> 13:45.067
>> CAITLYN: I love you.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.067
>> CANDIS: I love you.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.067
>> CAITLYN: Ah, good job

13:47.067 --> 13:49.067
tonight.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.600
Little Miss Jenny.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.600
>> JENNY: Hello.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.667
>> CAITLYN: Hey, babe.

14:00.667 --> 14:01.667
>> JENNY: I love the dress.

14:01.667 --> 14:02.567
>> CAITLYN: How you doing?

14:02.567 --> 14:03.267
>> JENNY: I'm really good.

14:03.267 --> 14:03.933
>> CAITLYN: Are you enjoying

14:03.933 --> 14:04.767
your time out here?

14:04.767 --> 14:05.433
>> JENNY: Oh, I love it.

14:05.433 --> 14:06.200
I love coming out here.

14:06.200 --> 14:06.867
>> CAITLYN: What are you

14:06.867 --> 14:07.700
reading?

14:07.700 --> 14:08.700
>> JENNY: Uh, this is a

14:08.700 --> 14:09.700
collection of short stories.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.700
My mother collected books, and,

14:10.700 --> 14:11.700
uh, it's a book that I actually

14:11.700 --> 14:12.700
found in her library and I'm

14:12.700 --> 14:13.700
like, "Huh."

14:13.700 --> 14:14.700
>> CAITLYN: Well, here's to our

14:14.700 --> 14:15.367
friendship.

14:15.367 --> 14:16.100
>> JENNY: Here's to our

14:16.100 --> 14:16.767
friendship.

14:16.767 --> 14:17.533
>> CAITLYN: We've come a long

14:17.533 --> 14:18.500
way, haven't we?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.500
>> JENNY: You know, I have to

14:19.500 --> 14:20.900
say, you seem different to me

14:20.900 --> 14:23.167
than when I first started

14:23.167 --> 14:24.367
getting to know you.

14:24.367 --> 14:25.533
>> CAITLYN: Absolutely.

14:25.533 --> 14:27.367
>> JENNY: You seem so much more

14:27.367 --> 14:28.667
confident, comfortable.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.667
>> CAITLYN: Right now, I still

14:29.667 --> 14:30.667
have a lot of firsts, yes.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.667
>> JENNY: Yeah.

14:31.667 --> 14:32.667
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, but I'm

14:32.667 --> 14:33.667
getting there.

14:33.667 --> 14:34.667
That first trip to San Francisco

14:34.667 --> 14:35.667
was the first time in my life I

14:35.667 --> 14:36.667
ever packed a bag with just

14:36.667 --> 14:37.667
Caitlyn clothes.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.067
>> JENNY: I know. Pretty cool.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.133
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

14:40.133 --> 14:41.400
>> JENNY: Speaking of the, um,

14:41.400 --> 14:42.967
uh, the road trip crew, I

14:42.967 --> 14:44.167
understand that you all were out

14:44.167 --> 14:45.267
at The Abbey?

14:45.267 --> 14:46.267
>> CAITLYN: Yes, well...

14:46.267 --> 14:47.267
>> JENNY: Tell me about it.

14:47.267 --> 14:48.267
Was it good?

14:48.267 --> 14:49.867
>> CAITLYN: Um...

14:49.867 --> 14:51.067
>> JENNY: Did you feel

14:51.067 --> 14:52.267
uncomfortable?

14:52.267 --> 14:53.100
>> CAITLYN: A little bit

14:53.100 --> 14:54.100
uncomfortable, yes.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.100
They had guys dancing all over

14:55.100 --> 14:56.100
the place, yeah.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.100
Could I, like, stare at the

14:57.100 --> 14:58.767
guy? No.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.600
Plus, they were all packing.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.133
(Jenny laughs)

15:02.133 --> 15:03.733
You know, The Abbey, they're

15:03.733 --> 15:04.833
all packing.

15:04.833 --> 15:05.833
You know, you go, "Oh, my God."

15:05.833 --> 15:06.833
Yeah.

15:06.833 --> 15:07.833
>> JENNY: Well, you know, some

15:07.833 --> 15:08.833
people would think guys...

15:08.833 --> 15:09.833
>> CAITLYN: You know, honestly?

15:09.833 --> 15:10.833
>> JENNY: ...seeing guys packing

15:10.833 --> 15:12.067
would be an exciting thing.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.400
>> CAITLYN: That may be...

15:13.400 --> 15:14.667
That's very true.

15:14.667 --> 15:15.733
>> JENNY: It can be hard for

15:15.733 --> 15:16.967
some people to understand that

15:16.967 --> 15:18.567
who you love is different from

15:18.567 --> 15:19.867
who you are.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.367
This is a thing she's-she's got

15:21.367 --> 15:23.100
to make... to get over.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.600
It's a funny place for her to be

15:25.600 --> 15:28.233
conservative, considering how

15:28.233 --> 15:29.933
much progress she's made.

15:29.933 --> 15:31.767
Um, when I went through what

15:31.767 --> 15:33.200
you're going through right now,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.600
I wasn't sure that I was gonna

15:34.600 --> 15:36.367
remain attracted to women.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.867
I thought I can prove to

15:37.867 --> 15:39.133
everyone I'm really a woman by

15:39.133 --> 15:40.433
now I'll be with guys, which is

15:40.433 --> 15:41.800
a messed-up thing to think.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.867
>> JENNY: But at a certain

15:43.867 --> 15:44.933
point, I realized the needle of

15:44.933 --> 15:46.600
my compass kept pointing back

15:46.600 --> 15:48.933
not only to women, but also

15:48.933 --> 15:50.067
to-to my wife.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, you lucked out

15:51.067 --> 15:52.067
on that one.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.333
>> JENNY: Yeah. So...

15:53.333 --> 15:54.733
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, 'cause it's

15:54.733 --> 15:55.800
more fun to go through life with

15:55.800 --> 15:56.867
somebody else.

15:56.867 --> 15:57.867
>> JENNY: And that's the thing

15:57.867 --> 15:58.900
that I... that I want for you.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.333
And I know that you've said

16:00.333 --> 16:01.733
many, many times that thinking

16:01.733 --> 16:03.467
about who you want to be in love

16:03.467 --> 16:04.467
with is the last thing on your

16:04.467 --> 16:05.567
list.

16:05.567 --> 16:06.733
But humor me.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.800
Think about it.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.067
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I will.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.133
Oh, I definitely am.

16:10.133 --> 16:11.400
I always have my... I am.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.467
I've got the biggest open mind

16:12.467 --> 16:13.733
in the world.

16:13.733 --> 16:14.967
>> JENNY: So, who's that open

16:14.967 --> 16:18.600
eye looking at?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.333
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

16:20.333 --> 16:22.333
right now, I'm just kind of so

16:22.333 --> 16:24.533
obsessed with educating people.

16:24.533 --> 16:25.700
>> JENNY: Yeah, but you're not

16:25.700 --> 16:27.267
answering my question.

16:27.267 --> 16:28.267
>> CAITLYN: But wait, wait,

16:28.267 --> 16:29.100
wait, wait. You're, uh...

16:29.100 --> 16:29.900
I'm getting to it.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.867
I'm getting to the answer.

16:30.867 --> 16:31.700
>> JENNY: Okay, all right.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.700
>> CAITLYN: Uh, I'm so excited

16:32.700 --> 16:33.700
about this, I'm really not

16:33.700 --> 16:34.700
thinking about stuff on the

16:34.700 --> 16:35.700
outside.

16:35.700 --> 16:36.767
>> JENNY: Caitlyn Jenner, you're

16:36.767 --> 16:37.967
pulling back on me.

16:37.967 --> 16:40.067
To... to run away from the

16:40.067 --> 16:41.533
issues of gender...

16:41.533 --> 16:42.533
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.633
>> JENNY: ...you became an

16:43.633 --> 16:45.167
Olympic champion and then you

16:45.167 --> 16:46.833
became a great parent.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.433
You're throwing yourself into

16:48.433 --> 16:49.567
your work again, and it's the

16:49.567 --> 16:51.433
best work in the world, but

16:51.433 --> 16:54.467
you're running away from it.

16:58.933 --> 16:59.800
>> JENNY: You're throwing

16:59.800 --> 17:00.833
yourself into your work again,

17:00.833 --> 17:01.967
and it's the best work in the

17:01.967 --> 17:04.133
world, but you're running away

17:04.133 --> 17:06.100
from it.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.667
>> CAITLYN: Well, uh, probably,

17:09.667 --> 17:11.067
yeah. I would say so, yeah.

17:11.067 --> 17:12.300
>> JENNY: So, so let's take...

17:12.300 --> 17:13.500
>> CAITLYN: But, honestly, I've

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
only been divorced two... two

17:15.500 --> 17:16.767
years, you know.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.167
It's not like I wasn't in a

17:18.167 --> 17:19.367
relationship for a long time.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.367
>> JENNY: So, you can see

17:20.367 --> 17:21.367
yourself with a woman?

17:21.367 --> 17:22.367
>> CAITLYN: Uh, well, I've

17:22.367 --> 17:23.367
always been with women.

17:23.367 --> 17:24.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.367
I-I don't have a problem with

17:25.367 --> 17:26.367
that.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.367
I can have my choices now.

17:27.367 --> 17:28.367
Yeah.

17:28.367 --> 17:29.767
It would... it would be very

17:29.767 --> 17:34.733
attractive to me to have a guy

17:34.733 --> 17:36.867
treat me like a woman.

17:39.133 --> 17:42.700
>> JENNY: What does that mean?

17:42.700 --> 17:44.800
>> CAITLYN: Uh, that you would

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
be treated like a normal woman,

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
okay?

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
>> JENNY: What do you mean, "a

17:47.800 --> 17:48.800
normal woman"?

17:48.800 --> 17:49.967
>> CAITLYN: Like any other woman

17:49.967 --> 17:51.467
on the street and not make it

17:51.467 --> 17:53.100
this big trans thing or this or

17:53.100 --> 17:54.633
that, just a normal

17:54.633 --> 17:56.367
relationship.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.433
>> JENNY: So, you know what,

17:57.433 --> 17:59.200
Caitlyn Jenner, you are a normal

17:59.200 --> 18:01.767
woman right now, today.

18:01.767 --> 18:04.333
A man is not...

18:04.333 --> 18:07.333
You don't need a man to make you

18:07.333 --> 18:08.533
a woman.

18:08.533 --> 18:09.533
Um...

18:09.533 --> 18:10.367
>> CAITLYN: Oh, now that's true.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.100
>> JENNY: A woman can make you a

18:11.100 --> 18:11.967
woman.

18:11.967 --> 18:12.967
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:12.967 --> 18:13.900
>> JENNY: I mean, I think it's a

18:13.900 --> 18:14.700
thing, I mean, it's a thing that

18:14.700 --> 18:15.400
women do.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.667
We look, we look to men to give

18:16.667 --> 18:18.600
us self-worth, and it's a thing

18:18.600 --> 18:19.933
that we need.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.100
I think, now that you're in the

18:22.100 --> 18:24.300
sisterhood, um, you know, you

18:24.300 --> 18:26.067
have gone to such trouble

18:26.067 --> 18:27.633
to become a woman, don't be

18:27.633 --> 18:28.633
a stupid one.

18:28.633 --> 18:29.667
Be a smart one.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.667
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I'm trying to

18:30.667 --> 18:31.667
be.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.667
Haven't I proved myself yet?

18:33.667 --> 18:35.333
>> JENNY: You don't need to

18:35.333 --> 18:36.333
prove yourself to me.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.333
You need to prove yourself to

18:37.333 --> 18:38.600
you.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.833
It's a process that people go

18:40.833 --> 18:42.700
through, accepting who they are

18:42.700 --> 18:44.800
sexually in this new world.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.367
Cait is not gonna find someone

18:46.367 --> 18:48.933
until she looks, and she can't

18:48.933 --> 18:51.267
look until she accepts herself.

18:51.267 --> 18:54.133
We all deserve love, and I-I

18:54.133 --> 18:55.733
worry for you, Caitlyn, that,

18:55.733 --> 18:58.167
um, you're-you're not letting

18:58.167 --> 19:00.333
yourself be loved.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.967
>> CAITLYN: I'll play that card

19:01.967 --> 19:03.933
someday.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.633
Hey, baby!

19:26.633 --> 19:29.633
How's everybody doing?

19:29.633 --> 19:30.633
All my traveling buddies are

19:30.633 --> 19:31.633
here.

19:31.633 --> 19:32.533
>> ZACKARY: Let me take your

19:32.533 --> 19:33.067
purse.

19:33.067 --> 19:33.700
>> CAITLYN: How are you?

19:33.700 --> 19:34.800
>> VAN: Hi, I'm Van.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.067
I'm Zackary's rotten sister.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.067
>> CAITLYN: No way.

19:37.067 --> 19:38.333
>> VAN: Yes, it's true.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.333
>> CAITLYN: The dirty one?

19:39.333 --> 19:40.333
>> VAN: To the core.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.167
>> CAITLYN: Of course.

19:41.167 --> 19:41.900
>> ANNABELLE: I'm Annabelle,

19:41.900 --> 19:42.667
Chandi's coworker.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.467
>> CAITLYN: Hi. Nice to see you.

19:43.467 --> 19:44.333
>> ANNABELLE: Nice to meet you.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.100
>> CAITLYN: Doesn't everybody

19:45.100 --> 19:46.133
look so nice?

19:46.133 --> 19:47.133
>> ZACKARY: Why don't we, uh,

19:47.133 --> 19:48.133
head on over.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.267
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

19:49.267 --> 19:50.633
Ever since the road trip, I

19:50.633 --> 19:51.900
really haven't had a chance to

19:51.900 --> 19:53.067
spend any time with the girls.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.967
I am so looking forward to

19:54.967 --> 19:56.767
having a great dinner and honest

19:56.767 --> 19:57.933
conversation.

19:57.933 --> 19:59.333
>> VAN: Thank you so much.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.167
>> CAITLYN: Where do you live?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.000
>> VAN: I live in the foothills

20:03.000 --> 20:04.467
of the Ozarks outside of St.

20:04.467 --> 20:05.800
Louis, Missouri, about an hour.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.933
>> ZACKARY: She also works in

20:06.933 --> 20:07.933
Hollywood.

20:07.933 --> 20:09.000
>> VAN: Well, I commute.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.033
>> ZACKARY: Halftime.

20:10.033 --> 20:11.267
Half of the year.

20:11.267 --> 20:12.267
>> CAITLYN: That's a long

20:12.267 --> 20:13.500
commute.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.667
>> ZACKARY: She survived all my

20:14.667 --> 20:15.800
boyfriends.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.467
>> VAN: And she survived all my

20:17.467 --> 20:18.533
plane wrecks.

20:18.533 --> 20:19.700
(Zackary laughs)

20:19.700 --> 20:21.667
>> CANDIS: It's so hard to meet

20:21.667 --> 20:24.267
somebody who is normal.

20:24.267 --> 20:25.833
It's a lot of work.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.833
>> CAITLYN: It's a lot of work.

20:26.833 --> 20:27.833
>> CANDIS: Having a relationship

20:27.833 --> 20:28.900
is a lot of work.

20:28.900 --> 20:29.900
>> TRACE: I gave up.

20:29.900 --> 20:30.900
>> VAN: How many guys have ever

20:30.900 --> 20:32.033
stood you up before?

20:32.033 --> 20:33.433
(Trace scoffs)

20:33.433 --> 20:34.567
You lost count?

20:34.567 --> 20:35.467
>> TRACE: Lost count.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.133
>> VAN: Me, too.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.233
>> TRACE: I met a guy, and we

20:37.233 --> 20:38.867
were texting and I was like,

20:38.867 --> 20:40.700
"Oh, by the way, uh, I'm TS."

20:40.700 --> 20:42.867
He was like, "Well, I've never

20:42.867 --> 20:43.900
dealt with that before, but

20:43.900 --> 20:45.033
okay."

20:45.033 --> 20:46.267
So then we were getting ready to

20:46.267 --> 20:47.533
meet up for a date, and I was

20:47.533 --> 20:48.933
like, "You know, are you sure

20:48.933 --> 20:49.933
you're good with my gender

20:49.933 --> 20:51.200
history and everything?"

20:51.200 --> 20:53.433
And he was like, "Wait, your

20:53.433 --> 20:55.800
gender history?"

20:55.800 --> 20:58.233
And I'm like, "Transsexual or

20:58.233 --> 20:59.200
transgender."

20:59.200 --> 21:00.567
"Oh, I thought you had Turner

21:00.567 --> 21:01.567
syndrome."

21:01.567 --> 21:02.567
(laughter)

21:02.567 --> 21:03.567
>> VAN: What's that?

21:03.567 --> 21:04.600
>> TRACE: And he was like, "Oh,

21:04.600 --> 21:05.833
I'm sorry.

21:05.833 --> 21:07.867
I can't deal with transsexual."

21:07.867 --> 21:09.833
And I was like, "Okay, so..."

21:09.833 --> 21:12.067
>> VAN: Well, he just passed up

21:12.067 --> 21:13.600
the best ice cream in the world,

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
honey.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
>> TRACE: Yeah, he called me,

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
like, two months later for a

21:16.600 --> 21:17.700
hookup, which they always do.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.133
>> CANDIS: Of course.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.133
>> TRACE: But, uh...

21:20.133 --> 21:21.267
>> CHANDI: It's crazy that once

21:21.267 --> 21:22.333
we share that information

21:22.333 --> 21:24.367
with-with them, how quickly that

21:24.367 --> 21:26.467
conversation goes from being a

21:26.467 --> 21:27.933
nice "I want to take you out and

21:27.933 --> 21:29.567
get to know you" to strictly

21:29.567 --> 21:31.600
sex, just instantly.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.833
>> CAITLYN: Really?

21:32.833 --> 21:33.833
>> CHANDI: Yes, Cait.

21:33.833 --> 21:34.867
>> WOMAN: Oh, definitely.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.100
>> ZACKARY: Basically, we're

21:36.100 --> 21:37.233
living in a world that has no

21:37.233 --> 21:38.400
place for us.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.367
>> CHANDI: Right.

21:42.967 --> 21:44.367
>> ZACKARY: Stick with women,

21:44.367 --> 21:45.700
Caitlyn-- much easier.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.433
>> VAN: Trans men though,

21:47.433 --> 21:48.467
they're good.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.500
Why don't you tell us about

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
that, Zackary.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.200
>> ZACKARY: They already know

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
about it.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.300
I love trans men.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.333
>> WOMAN: I do, too.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.333
>> CAITLYN: Really?

21:55.333 --> 21:56.333
>> VAN: There's a lot of trans

21:56.333 --> 21:57.333
on trans relationships though.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.333
>> ZACKARY: There really are.

21:58.333 --> 21:59.333
>> VAN: It's becoming a lot

21:59.333 --> 21:59.900
more popular.

21:59.900 --> 22:00.767
>> CAITLYN: Do you think it's

22:00.767 --> 22:01.467
good?

22:01.467 --> 22:02.167
>> VAN: Yes. They understand

22:02.167 --> 22:03.067
each other.

22:03.067 --> 22:03.900
>> ZACKARY: When we're dating

22:03.900 --> 22:05.067
cis people, we're really aware

22:05.067 --> 22:06.533
of the fact that we're trans,

22:06.533 --> 22:08.167
and when you're with another

22:08.167 --> 22:09.967
trans person, it's a completely

22:09.967 --> 22:11.333
free space.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.200
>> VAN: The trans man doesn't

22:13.200 --> 22:14.633
come with the shame that a cis

22:14.633 --> 22:16.267
male comes with, because it's

22:16.267 --> 22:18.533
been projected upon them if they

22:18.533 --> 22:20.067
love trans women that it's

22:20.067 --> 22:21.500
gonna, like, really box them

22:21.500 --> 22:22.733
into this "homosexual" style.

22:22.733 --> 22:24.867
>> CAITLYN: Right.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.100
>> VAN: So I think we should all

22:26.100 --> 22:27.433
just date trans men and get over

22:27.433 --> 22:28.700
it.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.867
>> TRACE: I think you're right.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.067
>> CAITLYN: To the trans men.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.767
>> VAN: May you all experience

22:32.767 --> 22:34.267
one in your lifetime.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.233
(laughter)

22:44.267 --> 22:46.067
>> CAITLYN: My God, it's like

22:46.067 --> 22:47.367
climbing Mount Everest!

22:47.367 --> 22:48.400
(Candis laughs)

22:48.400 --> 22:49.500
>> CANDIS: Hi, honey.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.800
>> CAITLYN: Oh, wait, wait,

22:50.800 --> 22:51.900
wait, color coordinated!

22:51.900 --> 22:52.900
(Candis laughs)

22:52.900 --> 22:53.900
That's so scary.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.067
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

22:56.067 --> 22:57.133
Are you kidding?

22:57.133 --> 22:58.933
>> CAITLYN: Where's a mirror?

22:58.933 --> 23:00.067
Where's a mirror?

23:00.067 --> 23:01.067
Of course there's a mirror in

23:01.067 --> 23:02.067
your house.

23:02.067 --> 23:03.067
>> CANDIS: We're wearing the

23:03.067 --> 23:03.800
same color.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.400
>> CAITLYN: We are.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.967
That's funny.

23:06.967 --> 23:08.267
>> CANDIS: Well, thank you for

23:08.267 --> 23:09.267
coming over.

23:09.267 --> 23:10.267
>> CAITLYN: My pleasure.

23:10.267 --> 23:11.267
What's the deal with your car?

23:11.267 --> 23:12.767
>> CANDIS: My air conditioning

23:12.767 --> 23:13.933
doesn't work.

23:13.933 --> 23:14.600
>> CAITLYN: No way.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.267
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

23:15.267 --> 23:16.100
>> CAITLYN: What year is the

23:16.100 --> 23:16.667
car?

23:16.667 --> 23:17.767
Let's go down and see the car.

23:17.767 --> 23:18.533
>> CANDIS: Okay.

23:18.533 --> 23:19.567
Be careful, because these have

23:19.567 --> 23:21.300
no traction, so walk sideways.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.633
>> CAITLYN: I got flats on.

23:22.633 --> 23:23.633
You got a bigger problem than

23:23.633 --> 23:24.467
me.

23:24.467 --> 23:25.467
>> CANDIS: If you were to kill

23:25.467 --> 23:26.267
yourself on these stairs, I

23:26.267 --> 23:26.933
would...

23:26.933 --> 23:27.667
>> CAITLYN: When are you gonna

23:27.667 --> 23:28.867
put an elevator in this place?

23:28.867 --> 23:30.200
Volvo?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.233
(Candis laughs)

23:31.233 --> 23:32.333
>> CANDIS: You don't see me in a

23:32.333 --> 23:33.333
Volvo?

23:33.333 --> 23:34.333
>> CAITLYN: No, I don't see you

23:34.333 --> 23:35.600
in a Volvo.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.633
What do you got for miles?

23:36.633 --> 23:38.233
>> CANDIS: 200,000.

23:38.233 --> 23:39.900
>> CAITLYN: You put 200,000

23:39.900 --> 23:40.567
miles on...

23:40.567 --> 23:41.533
>> CANDIS: Or is it 100,000?

23:41.533 --> 23:42.367
>> CAITLYN: Where the hell are

23:42.367 --> 23:42.867
you going?

23:42.867 --> 23:43.767
>> CANDIS: Maybe it's 100,000

23:43.767 --> 23:45.933
miles. (laughs)

23:45.933 --> 23:47.200
>> CAITLYN: It's 100,000.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.167
You're only off by 100,000.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.267
(bumper scrapes)

23:52.267 --> 23:53.300
Does it always do that?

23:53.300 --> 23:54.267
>> CANDIS: When there's more

23:54.267 --> 23:55.300
than one of us...

23:55.300 --> 23:56.200
>> CAITLYN: In the car?

23:56.200 --> 23:57.067
>> CANDIS: In the car.

23:57.067 --> 23:57.833
>> CAITLYN: Where's your

23:57.833 --> 23:59.900
backup video?

23:59.900 --> 24:01.333
>> CANDIS: See?

24:01.333 --> 24:03.200
Like, it just goes on.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.600
What is going with this car?

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
>> CAITLYN: Why did your

24:05.600 --> 24:07.067
blinkers go on for no reason?

24:07.067 --> 24:10.133
That's strange.

24:10.133 --> 24:11.567
>> CANDIS: I love that I have

24:11.567 --> 24:13.967
Caitlyn pumping gas.

24:13.967 --> 24:15.233
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

24:15.233 --> 24:17.433
It's what I do, girl.

24:17.433 --> 24:18.467
(Candis laughs)

24:18.467 --> 24:19.467
Yeah, I don't want you to break

24:19.467 --> 24:20.633
a nail.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.767
I've been doing that kind of

24:21.767 --> 24:23.567
stuff all my life, so I can help

24:23.567 --> 24:24.833
Candis out, you know, find a

24:24.833 --> 24:26.733
garage, get her car fixed,

24:26.733 --> 24:27.800
'cause it's got to be in working

24:27.800 --> 24:29.067
order.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.067
The electrical keeps, like,

24:30.067 --> 24:31.300
going crazy.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.300
>> MECHANIC: All right.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.300
>> CAITLYN: There's a

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
thud-thud-thud-thud-thud.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.300
>> MECHANIC: Okay.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.167
>> CAITLYN: Maybe a bad tire.

24:36.167 --> 24:37.200
>> MECHANIC: Check tires and a

24:37.200 --> 24:38.267
thumping noise.

24:38.267 --> 24:39.100
>> CAITLYN: And the air

24:39.100 --> 24:40.167
conditioning's not working now.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.400
>> MECHANIC: I'll give it a

24:41.400 --> 24:42.500
once-over, give it a safety

24:42.500 --> 24:43.433
check.

24:43.433 --> 24:44.267
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, that's

24:44.267 --> 24:45.300
exactly what it needs.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.200
>> MECHANIC: Okay, early next

24:46.200 --> 24:47.067
week, we'll get it all done.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.133
>> CANDIS: Thank you so much.

24:48.133 --> 24:48.900
>> MECHANIC: No problem.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.133
Done deal. Okay.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.133
>> CAITLYN: You kind of, like,

24:51.133 --> 24:52.200
need somebody in your life to

24:52.200 --> 24:53.467
take care of you, and most

24:53.467 --> 24:54.867
people take that for granted.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.467
And-and I-I never have.

24:57.467 --> 24:58.833
>> CANDIS: You know, the car

24:58.833 --> 25:00.067
thing has really bummed me out,

25:00.067 --> 25:01.700
because I don't feel in control,

25:01.700 --> 25:03.333
and I've always been somebody

25:03.333 --> 25:05.467
who's always been in control of

25:05.467 --> 25:06.667
my life and my career.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.967
And after moving out to

25:08.967 --> 25:10.333
Hollywood and having the market

25:10.333 --> 25:12.067
crash and everything kind of

25:12.067 --> 25:14.500
melted away and not working as

25:14.500 --> 25:17.067
much, it was a tough few years,

25:17.067 --> 25:18.067
you know?

25:18.067 --> 25:19.233
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

25:19.233 --> 25:20.467
I think one of the worst things

25:20.467 --> 25:22.900
you can do is not feel excited

25:22.900 --> 25:26.067
about the future, you know?

25:26.067 --> 25:27.933
>> CANDIS: It's been a long

25:27.933 --> 25:29.100
time.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.333
>> CAITLYN: Really?

25:30.333 --> 25:32.300
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.367
I-I moved out here with a guy,

25:38.367 --> 25:39.633
and...

25:39.633 --> 25:40.900
>> CAITLYN: Is this the same one

25:40.900 --> 25:42.067
you had had for years?

25:42.067 --> 25:43.200
>> CANDIS: Yeah, seven years.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.567
>> CAITLYN: Seven years

25:44.567 --> 25:45.567
together.

25:45.567 --> 25:47.100
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.133
A little over seven years.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.300
Then when things got rough, he

25:52.300 --> 25:55.333
was abusing, kind of abusing.

25:55.333 --> 25:58.333
I am a person who sees red

25:58.333 --> 26:00.433
flags but keeps going.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.367
>> CANDIS: Then when things got

26:09.367 --> 26:12.100
rough, he was abusing, kind of

26:12.100 --> 26:14.233
abusing.

26:14.233 --> 26:17.333
I am a person who sees red

26:17.333 --> 26:19.300
flags but keeps going.

26:24.367 --> 26:25.933
Like, my... one of my boyfriends

26:25.933 --> 26:27.467
ripped a sink out of the wall,

26:27.467 --> 26:29.800
in a rage.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.500
I allowed the men I choose to

26:32.500 --> 26:36.967
date in the past to treat me the

26:36.967 --> 26:39.133
way no woman should be treated.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.600
I played it off like, "Oh, it's

26:40.600 --> 26:41.800
okay; he was just having a bad

26:41.800 --> 26:43.167
night."

26:43.167 --> 26:44.767
Like, red flag.

26:44.767 --> 26:45.933
You know what I mean?

26:45.933 --> 26:46.900
>> CAITLYN: Major red flag.

26:46.900 --> 26:47.667
>> CANDIS: All of my

26:47.667 --> 26:49.367
relationships, every single one,

26:49.367 --> 26:50.633
I look back and I think, I

26:50.633 --> 26:54.133
should have gotten out or-or had

26:54.133 --> 26:57.833
a more finite, uh, line that you

26:57.833 --> 27:00.333
can't cross.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.300
It took me two years to break

27:02.300 --> 27:04.067
up, even though I knew that it

27:04.067 --> 27:05.400
wasn't right.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.633
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

27:06.633 --> 27:07.567
How long ago was this?

27:07.567 --> 27:09.267
>> CANDIS: This was, like, I

27:09.267 --> 27:11.400
don't know, three years ago.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.300
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

27:12.300 --> 27:13.067
>> CANDIS: And I've dated off

27:13.067 --> 27:15.433
and on, but... you know.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.300
>> CAITLYN: Anybody special?

27:16.300 --> 27:17.300
>> CANDIS: No.

27:17.300 --> 27:17.967
>> CAITLYN: No?

27:17.967 --> 27:18.733
>> CANDIS: No. I don't think

27:18.733 --> 27:19.967
I... I don't think I could go

27:19.967 --> 27:21.467
there anymore.

27:21.467 --> 27:22.967
I just, honestly, I don't trust

27:22.967 --> 27:24.533
the process. You know?

27:24.533 --> 27:27.200
Like, I-I... my whole life, I've

27:27.200 --> 27:29.133
wanted that, you know.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.800
Like, you've been so fortunate.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.567
You've had wives...

27:31.567 --> 27:32.267
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I've had

27:32.267 --> 27:32.767
those, yes.

27:32.767 --> 27:33.667
>> CANDIS: ...and you have kids.

27:33.667 --> 27:34.567
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. So fortunate.

27:34.567 --> 27:35.500
>> CANDIS: Like, I've... I've

27:35.500 --> 27:36.700
had failed relationship after

27:36.700 --> 27:38.300
failed relationship, and I can't

27:38.300 --> 27:39.500
figure out why.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.233
You know?

27:42.233 --> 27:43.967
It makes no sense, because I-I

27:43.967 --> 27:45.900
think of myself as, like, a-a

27:45.900 --> 27:47.267
good person.

27:47.267 --> 27:49.400
I'm really nice to the people

27:49.400 --> 27:50.567
that I'm with.

27:50.567 --> 27:53.600
But, um, it just... I have this,

27:53.600 --> 27:56.500
like, this relationship idea on

27:56.500 --> 27:58.067
a pedestal, because my parents

27:58.067 --> 27:59.467
have been married for 50 years,

27:59.467 --> 28:04.367
and-and I just let things go.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.267
I-I think it also... like, just

28:06.267 --> 28:07.367
being trans and trying to date

28:07.367 --> 28:08.367
is-is...

28:08.367 --> 28:09.533
>> CAITLYN: Tough.

28:09.533 --> 28:10.533
>> CANDIS: Tough, because you

28:10.533 --> 28:11.300
don't find a guy that's...

28:11.300 --> 28:12.067
>> CAITLYN: You're limited.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.200
>> CANDIS: You're limited.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.200
I want, with all my heart, what

28:17.200 --> 28:18.800
my parents have.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.700
But your pool of men, it gets

28:21.700 --> 28:23.500
thinner as you... once you, you

28:23.500 --> 28:26.167
know, tell them that you're...

28:26.167 --> 28:27.533
you're trans.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.233
>> CAITLYN: It's gonna be okay.

28:29.233 --> 28:30.333
It's gonna be okay.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.067
(Candis sniffles)

28:31.067 --> 28:31.867
>> CANDIS: But I, you know...

28:31.867 --> 28:33.067
>> CAITLYN: The last two years,

28:33.067 --> 28:33.900
you didn't have me, hanging out,

28:33.900 --> 28:35.667
to hang out with, right?

28:35.667 --> 28:36.600
>> CANDIS: I know.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.633
I just don't think it's ever

28:37.633 --> 28:38.600
gonna happen in the love

28:38.600 --> 28:40.700
department.

28:40.700 --> 28:41.700
>> CAITLYN: You can't think

28:41.700 --> 28:42.367
that way.

28:42.367 --> 28:43.500
(dog barks)

28:43.500 --> 28:45.367
You just can't think that way.

28:45.367 --> 28:46.533
(barking)

28:46.533 --> 28:47.733
Your dogs love you.

28:47.733 --> 28:49.200
(Candis laughs)

28:49.200 --> 28:50.200
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.233
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, it's gonna

28:51.233 --> 28:52.333
be okay.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.367
Got to be excited about the

28:53.367 --> 28:54.367
future.

28:54.367 --> 28:55.367
(Candis sniffles)

28:55.367 --> 28:57.333
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

29:03.133 --> 29:05.167
>> CHANDI: Hey, sister.

29:05.167 --> 29:06.067
Look at you.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.167
>> CANDIS: Hi.

29:07.167 --> 29:08.167
You look so pretty.

29:08.167 --> 29:09.200
>> CHANDI: Mm, don't you look

29:09.200 --> 29:10.200
gorg.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.167
>> CANDIS: We're both kind of

29:11.167 --> 29:12.467
flowy, salon mamas.

29:12.467 --> 29:13.267
>> CHANDI: A little flowy and

29:13.267 --> 29:14.100
fun and...

29:14.100 --> 29:15.067
>> CANDIS: I love the hair.

29:15.067 --> 29:15.933
>> CHANDI: Thank you.

29:15.933 --> 29:16.767
You know, another one of my

29:16.767 --> 29:17.667
hats.

29:17.667 --> 29:21.133
(Candis laughs)

29:21.133 --> 29:22.133
>> CANDIS: So...

29:22.133 --> 29:22.933
>> CHANDI: So what's going on,

29:22.933 --> 29:24.367
mama?

29:24.367 --> 29:25.900
>> CANDIS: Just, you know...

29:25.900 --> 29:28.867
I've been trying to date online,

29:28.867 --> 29:29.833
and that's just not really

29:29.833 --> 29:30.833
working, you know?

29:30.833 --> 29:32.800
>> CHANDI: Mmm...

29:34.967 --> 29:38.100
For us, it's just... the hardest

29:38.100 --> 29:39.833
thing.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.767
But the killer part is that some

29:41.767 --> 29:43.067
guys just think that we'll go

29:43.067 --> 29:44.133
for anything.

29:44.133 --> 29:44.933
>> CANDIS: Mm.

29:44.933 --> 29:45.933
>> CHANDI: You know what I mean?

29:45.933 --> 29:47.100
As if we don't have standards or

29:47.100 --> 29:48.100
morals...

29:48.100 --> 29:49.100
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.233
>> CHANDI: ...or a type or any

29:51.233 --> 29:52.233
of those things.

29:52.233 --> 29:53.533
They just think we want anything

29:53.533 --> 29:55.100
that's moving, and that's not

29:55.100 --> 29:56.400
the case.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.833
>> CANDIS: A lot of us girls...

29:57.833 --> 29:58.833
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm?

29:58.833 --> 29:59.900
>> CANDIS: ...tolerate a whole

29:59.900 --> 30:01.033
bunch of (bleep).

30:01.033 --> 30:04.800
Because they feel like they...

30:04.800 --> 30:08.167
you know, have to deal with the

30:08.167 --> 30:09.467
crap that men, you know, dish

30:09.467 --> 30:10.133
out.

30:10.133 --> 30:10.833
>> CHANDI: Because of who they

30:10.833 --> 30:11.500
are.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.200
>> CANDIS: Because of who and

30:12.200 --> 30:13.367
what they are.

30:13.367 --> 30:14.933
>> CHANDI: I say no to that.

30:14.933 --> 30:16.167
>> CANDIS: No.

30:16.167 --> 30:17.733
>> CHANDI: And finding men who

30:17.733 --> 30:20.567
are willing to commit, you know,

30:20.567 --> 30:22.367
that's the challenge.

30:22.367 --> 30:23.933
>> CANDIS: I don't think it's

30:23.933 --> 30:25.367
gonna happen.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.833
Because of that fact, you know?

30:27.833 --> 30:29.200
No, I don't.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.933
Like, I-I put in, I put in all

30:30.933 --> 30:33.300
my hopes and my dreams in a

30:33.300 --> 30:34.867
bunch of relationships that went

30:34.867 --> 30:35.700
nowhere.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.500
>> CHANDI: I don't want to hear

30:36.500 --> 30:37.300
you say that.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.167
(Candis chuckles)

30:38.167 --> 30:39.433
We just have to maintain that

30:39.433 --> 30:40.200
hope.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.967
We have all the goods.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.733
Why they can't see that yet--

30:43.733 --> 30:45.067
that's not our problem.

30:45.067 --> 30:46.133
>> CANDIS: Right.

30:46.133 --> 30:49.000
>> CHANDI: Somebody will get it.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.400
>> CANDIS: Maybe I should just

30:50.400 --> 30:51.700
date Cait.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.633
(laughs)

30:52.633 --> 30:53.467
>> CHANDI: Well, why not?

30:53.467 --> 30:54.500
Why not?

30:54.500 --> 30:56.300
It's all over the papers anyway.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.233
>> CANDIS: It is.

30:57.233 --> 30:57.967
I mean, everybody thinks we are

30:57.967 --> 30:58.800
anyway.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.600
>> CHANDI: And who would be more

30:59.600 --> 31:00.933
perfect for Cait than someone

31:00.933 --> 31:02.533
who understands her?

31:02.533 --> 31:04.333
Oh, complete journey.

31:04.333 --> 31:05.667
(Candis laughs)

31:05.667 --> 31:07.300
Yes.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.333
>> CANDIS: My gosh.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.300
>> CHANDI: Yes.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.433
>> CAITLYN: Well, you know, my

31:16.433 --> 31:18.467
little Candis, she's been kind

31:18.467 --> 31:19.533
of down.

31:19.533 --> 31:21.267
Down on her love life, down on

31:21.267 --> 31:22.633
work, down on this, down on

31:22.633 --> 31:23.700
that.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.233
I want to cheer her up, and so

31:25.233 --> 31:26.733
I'm gonna invite her to camp

31:26.733 --> 31:27.867
day.

31:27.867 --> 31:29.500
Yes, we're going to a camp that

31:29.500 --> 31:31.933
is all transgender kids.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.633
What a great idea!

31:33.633 --> 31:34.600
One of the big problems with

31:34.600 --> 31:36.333
being trans, especially as a

31:36.333 --> 31:37.967
youth, is you really feel

31:37.967 --> 31:39.067
isolated.

31:39.067 --> 31:40.400
You feel like you are the only

31:40.400 --> 31:41.700
person in the world that is

31:41.700 --> 31:42.700
trans.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.600
To, uh, find people that they

31:44.600 --> 31:45.900
can identify with, that they can

31:45.900 --> 31:47.467
be friends with, it's so very

31:47.467 --> 31:48.533
important.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.933
I hope that this camp will

31:49.933 --> 31:52.233
re-inspire little Candis and get

31:52.233 --> 31:54.067
her going again, because life's

31:54.067 --> 31:56.067
good and it's short.

32:01.767 --> 32:03.067
Hello, everybody.

32:03.067 --> 32:03.633
>> KIDS: Hi.

32:03.633 --> 32:04.200
>> CAITLYN: Caitlyn.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.067
How are you?

32:05.067 --> 32:05.967
>> COUNSELOR: Everyone, this is

32:05.967 --> 32:06.867
Caitlyn and Candis.

32:06.867 --> 32:07.900
>> CANDIS: Hi, you guys.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.667
>> CAITLYN: Good, we'll start

32:08.667 --> 32:09.667
down here. Slide over.

32:09.667 --> 32:10.800
(laughter)

32:10.800 --> 32:12.067
Where do we start?

32:12.067 --> 32:12.967
>> NICK: Well, we want to

32:12.967 --> 32:15.200
welcome everyone to camp, and,

32:15.200 --> 32:16.633
um, welcome many of you back to

32:16.633 --> 32:17.633
camp.

32:17.633 --> 32:19.700
This is our sixth year running.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.467
We started with 40 kids, and

32:21.467 --> 32:22.867
we're serving over 400 campers

32:22.867 --> 32:23.600
this year in different

32:23.600 --> 32:24.267
locations.

32:24.267 --> 32:24.767
>> CANDIS: Wow.

32:24.767 --> 32:25.467
>> NICK: So we're really

32:25.467 --> 32:25.967
excited.

32:25.967 --> 32:26.633
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

32:26.633 --> 32:27.867
>> NICK: Yeah.

32:27.867 --> 32:29.900
I'm transgender, and I felt like

32:29.900 --> 32:31.300
a lot of camps don't know what

32:31.300 --> 32:32.233
to do with trans kids; they

32:32.233 --> 32:33.300
don't know where to house them

32:33.300 --> 32:35.067
or what to do, and I said, "All

32:35.067 --> 32:35.700
right.

32:35.700 --> 32:36.667
We got to start something."

32:36.667 --> 32:37.733
Have kids, you know, go

32:37.733 --> 32:39.100
somewhere and be understood.

32:39.100 --> 32:39.933
>> CAITLYN: What's the best part

32:39.933 --> 32:41.167
about coming to camp?

32:41.167 --> 32:42.600
>> ANYA: Camp isn't really about

32:42.600 --> 32:43.767
being trans.

32:43.767 --> 32:44.600
It's just about having a good

32:44.600 --> 32:45.733
time with people who understand

32:45.733 --> 32:47.367
you and get what you've gone

32:47.367 --> 32:49.067
through.

32:49.067 --> 32:49.700
>> JORDAN: The word "judging"

32:49.700 --> 32:50.600
and "judgment" doesn't even

32:50.600 --> 32:51.333
exist.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.733
I was a super shy and really

32:53.733 --> 32:55.833
self-conscious person before I

32:55.833 --> 32:57.067
went to camp, and it was a

32:57.067 --> 32:58.367
definite confidence-booster to

32:58.367 --> 32:59.767
be able to have that reassuring

32:59.767 --> 33:01.600
feeling that people are in this

33:01.600 --> 33:02.900
world just like me.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.067
>> JUSTIN: When I went to other

33:04.067 --> 33:08.067
camps, I was judged by what I

33:08.067 --> 33:09.867
liked and what I did.

33:09.867 --> 33:12.167
And at Aranu'tiq, being around

33:12.167 --> 33:14.233
friends is really nice when you

33:14.233 --> 33:16.367
haven't been around friends for

33:16.367 --> 33:18.533
most of your life.

33:18.533 --> 33:19.333
>> CAITLYN: Well, you got

33:19.333 --> 33:20.267
friends here.

33:20.267 --> 33:20.967
>> JUSTIN: Yeah.

33:20.967 --> 33:21.633
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.367
>> CANDIS: Wow, I wish I had a

33:22.367 --> 33:24.367
camp like this when I was 14.

33:24.367 --> 33:25.267
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I didn't have

33:25.267 --> 33:26.067
anything like this.

33:26.067 --> 33:26.933
Yes, yes.

33:26.933 --> 33:27.733
>> CANDIS: That's what's so

33:27.733 --> 33:29.167
magical about this, is being

33:29.167 --> 33:30.467
able to share stories with each

33:30.467 --> 33:31.500
other, which is so great at your

33:31.500 --> 33:32.500
age to do that.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.533
It's amazing.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.333
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.467
If I would've had somebody to

33:35.467 --> 33:36.567
open up to at a much younger

33:36.567 --> 33:38.867
age, it would've made me feel a

33:38.867 --> 33:41.900
lot better about myself.

33:41.900 --> 33:42.733
>> CANDIS: I would love to hear

33:42.733 --> 33:43.867
more stories.

33:43.867 --> 33:44.900
>> LILY: Yeah, my parents, uh,

33:44.900 --> 33:45.967
it was quite a shocker, because

33:45.967 --> 33:47.067
I was always the son who played

33:47.067 --> 33:48.133
football, you know?

33:48.133 --> 33:48.933
I was, like, the starting

33:48.933 --> 33:49.667
quarterback.

33:49.667 --> 33:50.933
If I had to say one thing, it's

33:50.933 --> 33:52.700
that I've heard throughout, you

33:52.700 --> 33:54.067
know, my transition and being

33:54.067 --> 33:57.100
trans that, um, you know, "Oh,

33:57.100 --> 33:58.133
maybe you're just confused about

33:58.133 --> 33:59.067
your gender."

33:59.067 --> 33:59.900
And I think that, because we

33:59.900 --> 34:00.800
have to go through this whole

34:00.800 --> 34:01.900
experience and have so many

34:01.900 --> 34:03.067
people doubting our gender, that

34:03.067 --> 34:05.667
it really... it makes us,

34:05.667 --> 34:07.300
ourselves, know it better than

34:07.300 --> 34:08.433
most people do.

34:08.433 --> 34:09.700
I just learned so much from the

34:09.700 --> 34:11.933
campers and the counselors, just

34:11.933 --> 34:13.900
about what it means to be trans

34:13.900 --> 34:15.167
and also what it means to be a

34:15.167 --> 34:16.133
person.

34:16.133 --> 34:17.367
I know a couple people who

34:17.367 --> 34:18.433
haven't had that support and

34:18.433 --> 34:20.100
things are definitely harder.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.933
I just have to say, like, stick

34:21.933 --> 34:23.400
through it, because while you

34:23.400 --> 34:24.533
seem stuck in the moment, and

34:24.533 --> 34:26.500
you kind of are, there's going

34:26.500 --> 34:27.400
to be people who are going to

34:27.400 --> 34:28.600
help you and there's gonna be,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.333
you know, a community that

34:30.333 --> 34:31.767
will support you.

34:31.767 --> 34:32.633
>> JORDAN: If you're questioning

34:32.633 --> 34:34.267
your identity, I think people

34:34.267 --> 34:35.200
should come out.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.433
Even if it's just to, like, a

34:36.433 --> 34:38.167
close friend or to your pet,

34:38.167 --> 34:39.667
at least just saying that,

34:39.667 --> 34:41.433
like, "I'm a boy" or "I'm a

34:41.433 --> 34:43.067
girl," saying that is really

34:43.067 --> 34:45.467
helpful and brightens your soul.

34:45.467 --> 34:48.067
>> CAITLYN: I love that.

34:48.067 --> 34:50.133
>> CANDIS: Being around those

34:50.133 --> 34:52.733
kids, who were so vivacious,

34:52.733 --> 34:54.133
they just feel so good about

34:54.133 --> 34:55.533
themselves and they're so

34:55.533 --> 34:57.267
comfortable in their skin,

34:57.267 --> 34:59.300
really kind of inspires me.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.833
I know I was in a rut for a

35:00.833 --> 35:03.067
while with my career and my

35:03.067 --> 35:05.233
love life, and I realized that

35:05.233 --> 35:07.167
that stuff will come.

35:07.167 --> 35:10.100
It's about me feeling good about

35:10.100 --> 35:11.467
myself and being a good role

35:11.467 --> 35:12.633
model for people like these

35:12.633 --> 35:14.267
kids.

35:14.267 --> 35:15.867
It's the adults versus kids.

35:15.867 --> 35:16.867
>> BOY: We need help.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.700
>> CAITLYN: We'll kick their

35:17.700 --> 35:18.200
butt.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.200
>> COUNSELOR: All right, may the

35:19.200 --> 35:21.267
best team win!

35:21.267 --> 35:24.067
(cheering)

35:24.067 --> 35:26.367
>> CAITLYN: No! Don't let it go!

35:26.367 --> 35:28.667
This camp gives you hope.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.933
You see, at such a young age,

35:30.933 --> 35:32.600
these kids who are dealing with

35:32.600 --> 35:34.733
a very tough issue and dealing

35:34.733 --> 35:37.100
with it with grace and dignity.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.067
(cheering)

35:43.300 --> 35:44.967
>> CANDIS: Olympian, my ass.

35:44.967 --> 35:45.967
>> CAITLYN: I obviously didn't

35:45.967 --> 35:47.067
pick this team.

35:47.067 --> 35:48.167
(laughter)

35:48.167 --> 35:49.600
They're gonna come out the other

35:49.600 --> 35:51.367
side, just, you know, a great

35:51.367 --> 35:53.200
part of society.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.333
Thank you to the camp. Hey!

35:55.333 --> 35:56.367
We're all beautiful!

35:56.367 --> 35:58.333
Hey!

36:04.433 --> 36:06.433
>> CANDIS: Okay.

36:06.433 --> 36:08.467
I kind of had given up a little

36:08.467 --> 36:10.533
bit on love, but I have this

36:10.533 --> 36:12.833
friend who knows a matchmaker,

36:12.833 --> 36:14.767
so I decided just to do it.

36:14.767 --> 36:17.433
I'm really excited, um, to see

36:17.433 --> 36:19.233
if it's even possible for a

36:19.233 --> 36:21.167
matchmaker to match a trans

36:21.167 --> 36:23.133
woman.

36:30.867 --> 36:32.167
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

36:32.167 --> 36:33.633
>> CANDIS: You-you look hot!

36:33.633 --> 36:35.167
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I don't know

36:35.167 --> 36:36.267
how you girls walk in these

36:36.267 --> 36:36.933
shoes.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.267
So, of course, I brought my

36:38.267 --> 36:39.267
sandals.

36:39.267 --> 36:40.400
>> CANDIS: Just in case.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.633
>> CAITLYN: Just in case.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.733
>> CANDIS: That's for the ride

36:42.733 --> 36:43.733
home.

36:43.733 --> 36:44.500
>> CAITLYN: Or down the stairs.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.500
>> CANDIS: Those goddamn stairs.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.533
>> CAITLYN: Are we doing this?

36:46.533 --> 36:47.533
>> CANDIS: We're doing this.

36:47.533 --> 36:48.833
I asked Cait to come over here

36:48.833 --> 36:51.100
and support me, but we both

36:51.100 --> 36:52.733
should utilize the matchmaker's

36:52.733 --> 36:55.133
services, so I'm gonna try to

36:55.133 --> 36:56.533
convince her to go along with

36:56.533 --> 36:57.733
it.

36:57.733 --> 36:59.300
You know, I'm actually excited

36:59.300 --> 37:02.133
about getting you to try to get

37:02.133 --> 37:04.700
matched up also.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.167
>> CAITLYN: Not...

37:06.167 --> 37:07.167
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.333
>> CAITLYN: ...in a million

37:08.333 --> 37:09.633
years.

37:09.633 --> 37:10.633
>> CANDIS: Cait.

37:10.633 --> 37:11.567
>> CAITLYN: No, I-I...

37:11.567 --> 37:13.067
I don't need a matchmaking

37:13.067 --> 37:14.200
service.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.400
>> CANDIS: Well, you don't have

37:15.400 --> 37:16.500
to, like, go out on a

37:16.500 --> 37:17.633
full-fledged date or anything.

37:17.633 --> 37:18.800
They're not gonna put your face

37:18.800 --> 37:19.867
on a...

37:19.867 --> 37:20.933
(Samson howling, barking)

37:20.933 --> 37:21.933
>> CAITLYN: Please.

37:21.933 --> 37:22.933
Please.

37:22.933 --> 37:23.933
>> CANDIS: He's here.

37:23.933 --> 37:25.167
It's okay, Samson.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.433
Samson, really.

37:26.433 --> 37:27.433
Hi. How are you?

37:27.433 --> 37:28.433
>> LOUIE: Good.

37:28.433 --> 37:29.300
How are you?

37:29.300 --> 37:30.100
>> CANDIS: Good. I'm Candis.

37:30.100 --> 37:30.933
>> LOUIE: I'm Louie.

37:30.933 --> 37:31.567
>> CANDIS: Come on in.

37:31.567 --> 37:32.267
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

37:32.267 --> 37:33.067
>> LOUIE: Hi, nice to meet you,

37:33.067 --> 37:34.500
too.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.500
Gorgeous.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.733
You ladies are gorgeous.

37:36.733 --> 37:37.867
>> CANDIS: Why don't we go out

37:37.867 --> 37:38.900
into the backyard? It's nice...

37:38.900 --> 37:39.700
>> CAITLYN: Let's go hit the

37:39.700 --> 37:40.200
backyard.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.067
>> LOUIE: Please, after you.

37:41.067 --> 37:42.067
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

37:42.067 --> 37:43.933
Would you like a glass of wine?

37:43.933 --> 37:45.900
>> LOUIE: Uh, sure.

37:50.933 --> 37:51.933
>> CANDIS: There you go.

37:51.933 --> 37:53.067
>> LOUIE: Awesome.

37:53.067 --> 37:54.100
>> CAITLYN: Tell me a little

37:54.100 --> 37:55.100
bit about what you guys do.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.100
>> LOUIE: Uh, so I've been doing

37:56.100 --> 37:57.300
this for almost 13 years.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.200
>> CAITLYN: Have you really?

37:58.200 --> 37:58.900
>> LOUIE: I have.

37:58.900 --> 37:59.567
>> CAITLYN: My God, how many

37:59.567 --> 38:00.733
successful ones?

38:00.733 --> 38:01.533
>> LOUIE: Thousands.

38:01.533 --> 38:02.200
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

38:02.200 --> 38:02.967
I'm excited now.

38:02.967 --> 38:03.800
>> CANDIS: I know.

38:03.800 --> 38:04.867
>> CAITLYN: I'm excited for you.

38:04.867 --> 38:05.867
>> LOUIE: We typically cater to

38:05.867 --> 38:06.967
high-quality, high-caliber,

38:06.967 --> 38:08.200
well-educated and/or self-made

38:08.200 --> 38:09.833
men and women looking for

38:09.833 --> 38:10.967
long-term relationships.

38:10.967 --> 38:11.900
>> CANDIS: That's perfect.

38:11.900 --> 38:12.700
Sounds like us.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.567
>> CAITLYN: Let's get it going

38:13.567 --> 38:14.633
for her. What?

38:14.633 --> 38:16.300
Well, for you, yeah, you, yeah.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.500
This is all about you tonight.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.500
>> CANDIS: Okay, well, we'll

38:19.500 --> 38:20.500
see.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.767
(laughter)

38:21.767 --> 38:22.767
>> LOUIE: So I've never, um,

38:22.767 --> 38:24.333
actually matched or worked with,

38:24.333 --> 38:26.067
um, trans women, um, or any

38:26.067 --> 38:27.400
trans men.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.900
Um, but I'm excited.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.700
I mean, I see you as a

38:30.700 --> 38:31.867
beautiful, successful,

38:31.867 --> 38:32.967
accomplished woman.

38:32.967 --> 38:34.500
I really feel that I can, I can

38:34.500 --> 38:35.433
match you.

38:35.433 --> 38:36.867
You know, the four elements of

38:36.867 --> 38:37.867
chemistry that most people talk

38:37.867 --> 38:38.933
about, the first one would be

38:38.933 --> 38:40.067
the obvious one, the physical

38:40.067 --> 38:41.067
chemistry.

38:41.067 --> 38:42.133
Next is intellectual,

38:42.133 --> 38:44.333
spiritual and emotional.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.367
So when you think about who you

38:46.367 --> 38:48.067
see yourself for a long-term

38:48.067 --> 38:49.167
relationship, what's the driving

38:49.167 --> 38:50.900
force behind who you see

38:50.900 --> 38:52.067
yourself with long-term?

38:52.067 --> 38:53.367
I'm gonna give you 100% to work

38:53.367 --> 38:55.067
with, but you cannot use the

38:55.067 --> 38:56.167
same percentage twice.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.333
Let's have Caitlyn do it, too.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.667
>> CANDIS: Yeah. Caitlyn.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.067
>> CAITLYN: Why am I doing it?

39:01.067 --> 39:02.267
>> CANDIS: You're doing it just

39:02.267 --> 39:04.133
for fun.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.433
We're not, we're not naming,

39:05.433 --> 39:06.367
we're not naming any names.

39:06.367 --> 39:07.233
>> CAITLYN: We're not putting

39:07.233 --> 39:08.300
names down.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.467
Physically, I don't know where

39:09.467 --> 39:10.600
I'm at.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.067
>> LOUIE: So do you take time to

39:12.067 --> 39:13.100
get to know somebody before you

39:13.100 --> 39:14.100
just determine if you're

39:14.100 --> 39:15.300
attracted to them, or do you

39:15.300 --> 39:16.367
know immediately when you see

39:16.367 --> 39:17.400
them?

39:17.400 --> 39:18.533
>> CAITLYN: God bless it, this

39:18.533 --> 39:19.600
is making me think for a minute.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.767
>> CANDIS: Okay, that's good.

39:22.767 --> 39:24.467
>> LOUIE: Most men that take

39:24.467 --> 39:26.067
this chemistry analysis, they

39:26.067 --> 39:27.367
think more masculine.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.500
They start with the lowest

39:28.500 --> 39:29.967
percentage.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.200
>> CAITLYN: Damn it!

39:32.200 --> 39:33.633
That's what I did.

39:33.633 --> 39:34.667
>> LOUIE: Is it?

39:34.667 --> 39:36.267
>> CAITLYN: Damn!

39:36.267 --> 39:37.700
I thought I had this transition

39:37.700 --> 39:38.967
down.

39:38.967 --> 39:40.067
(laughter)

39:40.067 --> 39:40.800
>> LOUIE: Okay, let me, let me

39:40.800 --> 39:41.667
correct myself.

39:41.667 --> 39:42.667
Most people who have more of

39:42.667 --> 39:43.667
a...

39:43.667 --> 39:44.600
>> CAITLYN: Don't try to back

39:44.600 --> 39:45.233
out of this.

39:45.233 --> 39:45.867
>> LOUIE: No, more of a

39:45.867 --> 39:46.667
masculine thought process.

39:46.667 --> 39:47.333
You know, you just process

39:47.333 --> 39:48.533
information almost like an

39:48.533 --> 39:50.067
engineer, if that makes sense.

39:50.067 --> 39:51.267
You overprocess, overanalyze

39:51.267 --> 39:52.533
information.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.300
You take a little bit more time

39:54.300 --> 39:55.767
to get to know someone, so

39:55.767 --> 39:57.233
you're the type of person that's

39:57.233 --> 39:58.800
gonna date their best friend.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.800
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.033
Well, that's true.

40:01.033 --> 40:03.833
Going through life with a

40:03.833 --> 40:06.300
partner, um, is always more fun.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.767
It's probably a lot more

40:07.767 --> 40:09.467
complicated now that I've been

40:09.467 --> 40:11.100
out, but it's possible.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.167
I never want to give up on love

40:13.167 --> 40:14.433
and partnership.

40:14.433 --> 40:15.633
That would be sad to give up

40:15.633 --> 40:16.567
on that.

40:16.567 --> 40:17.400
>> CANDIS: Come on, girl.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.333
Let's send him home.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.033
>> CAITLYN: Here we are, back

40:19.033 --> 40:20.200
where we started.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.167
>> CANDIS: Right.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.067
>> CAITLYN: Candis is coming

40:28.067 --> 40:29.067
over.

40:29.067 --> 40:31.033
I have a surprise for her.

40:34.133 --> 40:35.133
>> CANDIS: Hi!

40:35.133 --> 40:36.133
>> CAITLYN: Did you bring my

40:36.133 --> 40:37.133
paper?

40:37.133 --> 40:38.200
>> CANDIS: I did.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.767
Did you see them?

40:39.767 --> 40:41.433
This is, like, the Los Angeles

40:41.433 --> 40:43.033
Times  review on I Am Cait.

40:43.033 --> 40:44.700
>> CAITLYN: No, I didn't see it.

40:44.700 --> 40:45.800
>> CANDIS: And a gorgeous,

40:45.800 --> 40:47.033
gorgeous picture of you.

40:47.033 --> 40:48.267
>> CAITLYN: Is it a good shot?

40:48.267 --> 40:49.267
That's all I care about.

40:49.267 --> 40:50.533
>> CANDIS: Great shot.

40:50.533 --> 40:51.867
>> CAITLYN: Ooh!

40:51.867 --> 40:53.200
>> CANDIS: Yes.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.433
>> CAITLYN: "Transcendent TV."

40:55.433 --> 40:56.467
>> CANDIS: "Transforms reality

40:56.467 --> 40:58.600
genre."

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
>> CAITLYN: You know what?

40:59.600 --> 41:00.667
>> CANDIS: So good.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.267
>> CAITLYN: I so, so, so

41:02.267 --> 41:04.067
worried.

41:04.067 --> 41:05.500
Positive press.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
>> CANDIS: My God, positive

41:06.500 --> 41:07.500
press.

41:07.500 --> 41:08.500
>> CAITLYN: Positive press!

41:08.500 --> 41:09.500
>> CANDIS: My God.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.500
>> CAITLYN: I know.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.567
All right, so this is actually

41:11.567 --> 41:13.200
why I wanted you to come over.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.367
Um, I know we took your car the

41:15.367 --> 41:16.867
other day, so I got something

41:16.867 --> 41:18.333
for you to drive, so let's go.

41:18.333 --> 41:19.767
>> CANDIS: Really?

41:19.767 --> 41:21.733
(laughs)

41:24.767 --> 41:27.067
Are you kidding me?

41:27.067 --> 41:29.067
>> CAITLYN: Candis, yeah.

41:29.067 --> 41:31.167
>> CANDIS: I... (laughs)

41:33.200 --> 41:34.467
>> CAITLYN: I just thought you'd

41:34.467 --> 41:35.467
look good in it.

41:35.467 --> 41:36.700
>> CANDIS: I've never seen...

41:36.700 --> 41:38.333
I've never seen such a gorgeous

41:38.333 --> 41:39.333
car.

41:39.333 --> 41:42.367
Are you kidding?

41:42.367 --> 41:44.100
(laughs)

41:44.100 --> 41:45.333
>> CAITLYN: I have friends in

41:45.333 --> 41:46.700
the automotive world and to be

41:46.700 --> 41:48.367
able to get, in this case, a

41:48.367 --> 41:50.067
Lamborghini for a couple of

41:50.067 --> 41:51.867
days is very simple.

41:51.867 --> 41:53.500
And it puts a smile on my face

41:53.500 --> 41:54.867
when my dear friend looks so

41:54.867 --> 41:56.700
happy.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.467
I don't want Candis to give up

41:58.467 --> 42:00.300
on herself or her dreams.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.733
She deserves all the happiness

42:01.733 --> 42:03.800
in the world.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.600
(engine revving)

42:05.600 --> 42:07.300
Let's do it!

42:07.300 --> 42:08.867
Candis in the Lambo!

42:08.867 --> 42:10.233
>> CANDIS: I really could get

42:10.233 --> 42:11.467
used to this.

42:11.467 --> 42:13.433
(laughs)

42:19.200 --> 42:20.267
>> CAITLYN: Surf's up.

42:20.267 --> 42:21.267
>> CANDIS: Gorgeous.

42:21.267 --> 42:22.267
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

42:22.267 --> 42:23.667
Can't you see the two of us

42:23.667 --> 42:24.867
walking down the beach, the sun,

42:24.867 --> 42:26.233
the whole thing?

42:26.233 --> 42:28.200
(Candis laughs)

42:28.200 --> 42:30.933
I have no idea

42:30.933 --> 42:32.333
what the future holds

42:32.333 --> 42:33.733
when it comes to dating and

42:33.733 --> 42:35.067
relationships and all that kind

42:35.067 --> 42:36.267
of stuff.

42:36.267 --> 42:38.567
But I certainly wouldn't say no

42:38.567 --> 42:39.767
to anything.

42:39.767 --> 42:41.200
We don't know what the future

42:41.200 --> 42:42.500
holds, and that's kind of the

42:42.500 --> 42:43.633
exciting part, isn't it?

42:43.633 --> 42:44.667
>> CANDIS: It really is.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.633
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

42:57.967 --> 42:58.967
Yay!

42:58.967 --> 43:00.067
>> ESTHER: Can't believe I got

43:00.067 --> 43:01.067
here!

43:01.067 --> 43:02.067
>> CAITLYN: You made it, Mom!

43:02.067 --> 43:03.067
The ESPY Awards are coming up.

43:03.067 --> 43:04.067
Biggest pressure thing I've ever

43:04.067 --> 43:05.900
done on a subject I have never

43:05.900 --> 43:07.933
talked about in public.

43:07.933 --> 43:09.067
Kris and I haven't talked

43:09.067 --> 43:10.067
in months.

43:10.067 --> 43:12.067
She hasn't called me in a year.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.900
I would like to see you, okay?

43:13.900 --> 43:14.900
Kris is coming over.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.400
I don't think I've been ready,

43:16.400 --> 43:17.700
but I think it's time.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.667
(knocking)

43:21.700 --> 43:22.667
Well, look who's here.

43:22.667 --> 43:24.667
>> KRIS: Hello. Oh, my goodness.
