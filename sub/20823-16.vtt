WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:04.474
- This week
on Breakfast with Becca,

00:04.520 --> 00:06.772
we've got makeover magic
with Emily Fleet and a visit

00:06.830 --> 00:08.821
from nutritionist Bob Leonard.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.088
- OK, great. Let's cue up
the next one.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.608
- Hey, I got your text.
What's up?

00:13.660 --> 00:15.616
- Becca left me a voicemail

00:15.660 --> 00:17.616
saying she needed to see us
after her show.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.924
She seemed upset.
- SHH!

00:19.970 --> 00:21.926
- And be sure to tune in
on Friday when I sit down

00:21.970 --> 00:23.926
for an exclusive chat

00:23.980 --> 00:26.926
with City Councillor Samantha
Bowman. She's running

00:26.980 --> 00:29.585
for mayor and the old boys' club
is running for cover.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.508
See you then, 'cause
no breakfast is complete

00:32.550 --> 00:34.632
without Becca.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.592
- OK, cut! That's a wrap.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.291
- Here you go, Ms. D'Orsay.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.649
- Change this.
- It doesn't seem

00:42.690 --> 00:45.602
like there's a problem.
- Sometimes Becca's idea

00:45.650 --> 00:48.869
of a crisis can
be somewhat overblown.
- Oh, come!

00:48.910 --> 00:52.255
- Becca.
- Matt!

00:52.310 --> 00:54.699
Great to see you!

00:54.750 --> 00:57.264
When are we gonna book you
as a guest on the show?

00:57.310 --> 00:59.619
- I'll have to check
my schedule.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.799
- That's what you said
the last nine times I asked.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.570
I'm gonna make this happen,
Matt. You mark my words!

01:04.620 --> 01:06.838
Great show, Bec.

01:06.890 --> 01:08.926
Where are we with
the Samantha Bowman interview?

01:08.980 --> 01:11.232
- I submitted the interview
questions yesterday.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.236
I'm waiting to hear back.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.190
This isn't "gotcha" TV.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.413
- I gotcha!

01:17.460 --> 01:19.928
- Love this girl!
Love this girl.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.110
- I had to bend over backwards
to get that interview approved.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.126
Maggie's great
but she's never met

01:27.170 --> 01:29.126
a piece of fluff
she didn't like.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.422
- Is she the reason you called
us?

01:31.480 --> 01:33.516
- No. But she is one
of the reasons I need you guys

01:33.570 --> 01:35.526
to keep this to yourselves.
Any hint

01:35.570 --> 01:37.561
of a scandal and Maggie'll
break into a rash.

01:37.610 --> 01:40.693
- Shh!

01:40.750 --> 01:42.786
Follow me.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.878
- Your water, Ms. D'Orsay.
- Thanks, Tina.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.886
And pick up that dry cleaning
for me, all right?

01:51.930 --> 01:55.058
- Already done!
- And I only asked last Tuesday!

01:55.110 --> 01:57.066
Ah, millennials.

01:57.110 --> 02:00.284
Your wish is their
when I feel like it.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.503
- Oh, hey Becster!

02:02.550 --> 02:04.893
Great cooking segment
this morning.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.941
Colour me amazed!

02:06.990 --> 02:09.458
- Thanks, Jeffrey. And may I say

02:09.520 --> 02:11.329
your weather report this morning
made the downpour

02:11.390 --> 02:13.210
seem like a guilty pleasure.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.176
Calls himself a meteorologist.

02:21.220 --> 02:24.223
He wouldn't know a cold front
if it smacked him in the face.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.522
- Becca, as fascinating as it is
to get a glimpse inside

02:26.580 --> 02:28.093
your glamorous world
of sugar-coated insults,

02:28.140 --> 02:30.927
could we get on
with this, please?

02:35.450 --> 02:38.408
- OK, so I got to the studio
this morning as usual.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.416
Came to my room

02:40.460 --> 02:42.849
to leave my things here
and go to hair and makeup...

02:42.900 --> 02:45.505
and then I found this.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.246
- I don't get it.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.427
_ Aren't flowers _
In a dressmg room a good thing?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.697
"You will be mine."

03:08.750 --> 03:10.706
- It's my stalker.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.968
He's back.

03:14.930 --> 03:18.400
- I see you and you see me

03:18.450 --> 03:22.750
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

03:22.810 --> 03:26.371
Oh boy, you've got to know

03:26.420 --> 03:28.547
What my head overlooks

03:28.590 --> 03:32.242
The senses will show
to my heart

03:32.290 --> 03:37.205
When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my

03:37.260 --> 03:40.297
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

03:40.350 --> 03:42.773
Private Eyes

03:42.830 --> 03:45.390
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

03:45.440 --> 03:47.305
Watching you

03:52.270 --> 03:54.261
- You better fill her in.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.966
: Well, Shade and I
had just started dating.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.750
And I had my first
meteorologist position,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.143
delivering the weather
on Channel 3's morning news.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.282
- And that's when the_ flowers
appeared In your dressmg room.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.106
- Always with notes
in powder pink envelopes.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.378
- At first, the messages
were pretty innocent, you know?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.981
Like old-fashioned valentines.
But then they got scarier

04:16.030 --> 04:18.169
and scarier.
- Until they became

04:18.210 --> 04:20.986
outright threats.
- I couldn't sleep,

04:21.040 --> 04:22.814
I couldn't eat. I lost
my concentration at work.

04:22.870 --> 04:25.475
Finally, my doctor had
to prescribe medication.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.306
- It was a pretty horrible time.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.989
- Did the police
finally catch the guy?

04:30.050 --> 04:31.915
- Yeah. His name was Harvey
Stanwell. There was a trial;

04:31.960 --> 04:35.009
he was convicted. They gave him
a restraining order

04:35.050 --> 04:37.393
and some community service.
After making

04:37.450 --> 04:39.395
your life complete hell?
- The prosecutor said we were

04:39.450 --> 04:41.668
luclq to get a conviction
at all.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.178
- I have no idea.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.323
I haven't thought about him
in years... until this morning.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.804
- It's OK. We'll find him.
- We should contact the officer

04:49.850 --> 04:51.806
in charge of the case back then.

04:51.850 --> 04:55.069
- Yeah, Sergeant... O'Donnell.
He worked out of the 57th--

04:55.120 --> 04:57.338
- No. No police.
No one can know about this.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.336
- Becca...
- The last time this happened,

04:59.380 --> 05:01.848
the story was all over
the press. And you've seen

05:01.910 --> 05:05.459
these guys in here! They feed on
gossip like this. Not to mention

05:05.520 --> 05:07.511
I don't want Jules getting upset
right before she's going away

05:07.560 --> 05:09.903
to Italy. No.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.952
No. I just want this guy stopped
and I want to move on

05:13.000 --> 05:14.956
with my life
like nothing happened.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.264
- OK. We'll be discreet.
- Thank you.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.525
- Thank you.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.662
Well, according to
his court-appointed attorney,

05:24.710 --> 05:27.406
Harvey Sandwell completed
his community service

05:27.450 --> 05:29.759
and hasn't been in trouble
with the law since.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.234
- So why is this guy suddenly
stalking Becca again?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.714
- She's back on the air
for the first time in years.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.456
Maybe seeing her
sparked his obsession?

05:37.510 --> 05:39.455
- Did we find a way
to contact him yet?

05:39.510 --> 05:41.546
- His Ameechee page
says he volunteers

05:41.600 --> 05:43.556
at his community centre
Mondays and Wednesdays.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.945
He should be there now.
- All right. Text me
the address. Let's go.

05:46.990 --> 05:49.254
- Zoe, see if you can track down

05:49.300 --> 05:51.256
where the flowers_ were ordered
from and more Importantly--

05:51.300 --> 05:53.211
- Who ordered them. On it.

05:56.530 --> 06:01.001
: I'd been fine
for weeks and then...

06:01.050 --> 06:04.178
one day, I just couldn't stop
thinking about my ex-girlfriend.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.664
So I got in the car.
I was gonna drive

06:06.710 --> 06:09.702
over to her apartment--
- But you called your sponsor.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.320
- He helped me
realign my thinking.

06:12.370 --> 06:15.407
- Good work, Dale. Thanks
for sharing. OK. Let's
take a five minute break.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.107
Which one's our guy?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.287
- The leader of the group.
That's Harvey.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.286
Hey! Harvey!

06:25.340 --> 06:27.240
- Mr. Shade...
what're you doing here?

06:27.290 --> 06:30.032
- I think you know exactly
what I'm doing here.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.641
- Whoa. Whoa. I'm Angie Everett,
a private investigator,

06:33.690 --> 06:37.729
and Mr. Shade is my partner.

06:37.780 --> 06:40.522
- You can start
by leavmg Becca alone!

06:40.570 --> 06:42.879
I haven't had any
contact with her in years.

06:42.920 --> 06:46.048
- So you're denying sending
flowers and a threatening
message this morning?

06:46.100 --> 06:48.967
- It showed up in her dressing
room, just like the old days.

06:49.010 --> 06:52.013
- I had nothing to do with that.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.016
- Because I'm not
that person anymore.

06:54.060 --> 06:57.712
I feel terrible about everything
that I did back then.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.194
But now I take medication

07:00.240 --> 07:02.800
and I'm helping other men
who are struggling

07:02.850 --> 07:04.806
with the same_
obsesswe tendenCIes.

07:04.850 --> 07:07.159
- Where were you
between midnight and 6AM?

07:07.200 --> 07:10.636
- At home... with my wife
and kids.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.375
- Yeah. And I wouldn't

07:13.430 --> 07:15.466
do anything to jeopardize that.
- You know we'll be checking

07:15.520 --> 07:17.476
that alibi, Harvey.
- Please do.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.647
You won't find anything.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.691
Mr. Shade...

07:23.700 --> 07:25.691
I know you don't trust me.

07:25.740 --> 07:28.004
But you have to take
this situation very seriously.

07:28.050 --> 07:30.359
- Not only is this person

07:30.400 --> 07:32.391
stalking your wife,

07:32.450 --> 07:34.350
but they've gone to the trouble
to copy me.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.480
Whoever this person is,

07:36.540 --> 07:38.701
they need help.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.236
- Well, yeah, that's
why they cancelled

07:46.290 --> 07:49.544
Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.
All right. Bye.

07:49.590 --> 07:51.592
Oh, hey! Does one of those

07:51.640 --> 07:53.596
happen to belong to me?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.688
- It could...

07:55.730 --> 07:57.686
if...

07:57.730 --> 07:59.686
you run a credit card
number for me.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.550
- Are you attempting
to bribe a police officer

08:02.610 --> 08:04.510
with a glorified milkshake?

08:04.570 --> 08:07.437
- What if I sweeten
the deal with...

08:09.440 --> 08:11.396
- Oh, I'm going to hell.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.829
OK, I'll do it. Sure.
Do I still get the coffee too

08:13.880 --> 08:15.780
or is it like a trade?
- Yeah.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.183
- Thank you. So what's
the story with this?

08:18.230 --> 08:20.926
- Becca has a stalker. Yeah.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.756
- Hm.
- He left a bunch of roses

08:22.800 --> 08:24.586
in her dressing room
this morning. I tracked down

08:24.630 --> 08:26.586
the florist,
got the credit card number

08:26.630 --> 08:28.939
but it was an online order
and the name was fake.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.585
- Jeez, a stalker.
Serious business.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.596
All right, this'll
just take a second.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.801
- Hey! You didn't tell me
there's a blood drive here.

08:35.860 --> 08:38.556
We should donate!

08:38.600 --> 08:42.297
This actually got cancelled.
I don't know why I had that on
my desk. Hey, the number's up!

08:42.340 --> 08:44.296
- All right.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.422
Let's find
this cardholder's name.

08:49.350 --> 08:52.399
O... M... G.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.170
- After meeting Harvey,
I have a hard time believing

08:58.230 --> 09:00.391
he's stalking Becca again.
He seems to have really

09:00.450 --> 09:02.748
turned his life around.
- A leopard that crazy

09:02.800 --> 09:04.882
can't change his spots.

09:04.930 --> 09:07.797
- There's Becca. This is Zoey.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.750
I'll catch up with you later.
- All right.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.755
- Hey...
- Shadow!

09:11.810 --> 09:14.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.596
I'd like to introduce you
to Councillor Samantha Bowman,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.676
a hero of mine
and this City's next mayor.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.857
- Well, I hope you're right
about that.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.290
- Nice to meet you. Aren't you
the one who got arrested?

09:25.340 --> 09:27.774
- Shadow!
- No, it's fine.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.776
Look, I will take
the recognition

09:29.830 --> 09:32.867
wherever I can get it.
Yes, I was part of the protest

09:32.920 --> 09:35.787
to prevent the destruction
of parkland in my ward.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.435
As you know, the environment's
really important to me.

09:38.490 --> 09:42.267
I've based my entire campaign
around it.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.094
- Samantha stopped by so
we could discuss the interview.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.869
We're gonna go
with a more intimate format

09:45.930 --> 09:47.704
so we can really dig in
to those questions.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.569
- Samantha, we're on
a pretty tight schedule.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.326
- I'm sorry, this is
my campaign manager,

09:52.370 --> 09:55.419
Simon Murphy, also known
as my task master

09:55.460 --> 09:57.974
and my right hand man.
- Nice to meet you.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.986
Now, if you'll excuse us.

10:00.030 --> 10:02.021
- I'll show you
to the board room.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.118
You'll want to follow me.
Jom us, Bec.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.208
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.997
- Well, the jury's still out
on him. We're gonna stay

10:12.040 --> 10:13.996
on top of it.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.905
Hey. What's wrong?

10:15.960 --> 10:17.734
Was Zoey able to find out
who sent the roses?

10:17.790 --> 10:20.475
- Yeah. Let's go talk about it.

10:20.530 --> 10:23.488
Who was it?

10:25.580 --> 10:28.401
- The name on
the credit card was...

10:28.450 --> 10:30.532
Becca D'Orsay.

10:37.980 --> 10:40.676
: I can't believe

10:40.720 --> 10:43.154
you think I'd actually
stoop so low as to pose

10:43.200 --> 10:45.543
as my own stalker? I mean,
for what

10:45.600 --> 10:47.374
- Look, you have to admit
you have been known

10:47.420 --> 10:49.297
to seek attention
from time to time.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.854
- Yes, I can be a bit dramatic.
!

10:51.910 --> 10:55.641
- OK. Even ifI did pull off
a stunt like this to raise

10:55.690 --> 10:58.568
my profile, I wouldn't
be stupid enough to use

10:58.610 --> 11:01.078
my own credit card!
- Yeah, you're right.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.178
I'm sorry.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.521
- OK, look. Someone is obviously

11:08.580 --> 11:10.525
trying to make you look bad
as they drive you crazy.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.400
- You guys really don't think
that Harvey did this?

11:12.450 --> 11:14.406
- He runs a support group
for other stalkers

11:14.450 --> 11:16.361
and he has an alibi.
- Yeah, but all the details

11:16.410 --> 11:19.140
wer_e_the same. _
- The original stalker trial

11:19.200 --> 11:21.327
is the third thing that comes up
if you google your name.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.713
- The roses,

11:23.770 --> 11:25.977
the pink envelope, the note.
It would be really easy

11:26.030 --> 11:28.248
for someone to find out the
details of the original attack

11:28.290 --> 11:30.724
and just mimic them.

11:30.770 --> 11:32.726
- Can you think of anyone
that might have accessed

11:32.770 --> 11:34.726
your credit card information?
- Not at the studio.

11:34.780 --> 11:38.079
I always keep my wallet locked
up in this drawer.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.600
Here's the credit card
right here.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.083
- Any chance you forgot to lock
this drawer yesterday?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.007
- Well, no... I... I guess.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.056
- Well, I...

11:56.100 --> 11:58.443
I had a fling, recently.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.445
It was nothing serious,

12:00.500 --> 12:02.798
it was just a boy at the gym.
!

12:02.850 --> 12:05.068
- He was more of a... boy toy.

12:05.110 --> 12:07.021
He's a personal trainer.

12:07.070 --> 12:08.935
- Better and better.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.726
- Lance Masters.

12:13.770 --> 12:16.944
- I leant him my credit card
because he broke a veneer

12:16.990 --> 12:19.299
and he needed a new one
and he couldn't afford it.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.558
- Can't have a boy toy
with only one front tooth.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.646
- Apparently not.
- I mean, I guess

12:23.690 --> 12:26.124
Lance could've copied
my credit card number.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.523
I broke up with him two weeks
ago and he wasn't

12:28.570 --> 12:30.526
very happy about it.
— He's gonna be less happy

12:30.570 --> 12:34.006
when he talks to us.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.189
- He works out of a gym next
to a vegan juice bar

12:36.230 --> 12:38.266
in Liberty Village.
- Of course he does.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.972
- TINA! Tell Maggie I'm coming!

12:51.900 --> 12:53.856
: I can‘t believe
Becca's dating a gym rat.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.891
- That is such
a double standard,

12:55.940 --> 12:58.158
like you haven't
dated a few... wow!

12:58.210 --> 13:00.075
VVhat

13:00.120 --> 13:02.168
- Nothing. Ijust, uh...

13:02.210 --> 13:04.166
I found Lance's profile picture.

13:04.210 --> 13:07.168
- Let's see. Please.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.120
- Maybe I should get a boy toy.

13:09.170 --> 13:11.650
So much muscle, so little time.
- Do you think you can

13:11.700 --> 13:13.827
pull yourself out of dream land
for five seconds

13:13.880 --> 13:15.916
and come up with a plan?
- Already done.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.837
You search Lance's car and...

13:17.880 --> 13:19.700
I'll search Lance.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.348
: Hey! What are you
doing back here?

13:24.410 --> 13:26.799
I thought we were supposed
to meet at the restaurant.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.149
- I got off work early
and I thought I'd pick you up

13:29.190 --> 13:31.146
this time.
- Oh, wow!

13:31.200 --> 13:33.760
- And I'm glad I did because
it looks like that blood drive

13:33.810 --> 13:36.153
wasn't cancelled after all!
- Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know

13:36.200 --> 13:38.020
what I was thinking.
Oh well! We can do it next time.

13:38.070 --> 13:40.857
I mean, we
still have time to donate blood

13:40.900 --> 13:42.811
before dinner.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.816
- Yeah, I...

13:44.860 --> 13:46.771
I... I can't.

13:49.430 --> 13:51.125
- All right, look. I don't like

13:51.170 --> 13:53.479
to talk about this too much,

13:53.520 --> 13:56.307
but I was on a police exchange
in England

13:56.350 --> 13:58.477
a few years ago back
when there was an outbreak

13:58.530 --> 14:00.919
of mad cow disease.
No, I don't have it.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.915
It's not like...
I wasn't exposed

14:02.970 --> 14:06.576
but the upshot is that...
I can't give blood.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.441
Ever. That's it.
Doctor's orders. For life.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.458
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I know. I mean,

14:12.500 --> 14:15.583
you think I don't wanna donate,
you know, while I can?

14:15.630 --> 14:18.019
It feels good to give!
I'm a charitable guy, right?

14:18.070 --> 14:21.062
So... yeah, it sucks.
- Yeah, I'm sorry I hit

14:21.120 --> 14:23.065
a sore spot.
- Oh, that's OK. Let's just go

14:23.120 --> 14:25.509
to dinner. Strangely, I could
murder a steak right now.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.596
Well, let's get back

14:27.640 --> 14:30.200
into those mad cows!
- Let's!

14:30.260 --> 14:33.423
- Come on, Angie!
Big waves! Slam!

14:33.480 --> 14:35.732
Slam! Slam!

14:38.050 --> 14:40.439
I really need a drink of water.
- Sure, sure.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.698
Absolutely.
- Oh, thanks. You know,

14:42.750 --> 14:44.695
you are really good at this.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.786
- It's a gift.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.740
Well, you're doing really great.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.223
Some of the women I train
aren't half as ripped as you.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.977
- Well, which half would that
be? Because I am sore all over.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.234
So... is there a special someone
in your life?

15:02.290 --> 15:04.929
Guy like you must
get swiped right a lot.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.935
- Oh, you know.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.026
I have my moments.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.594
- Was.

15:13.650 --> 15:15.424
It didn't go so well.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.904
- She was everything

15:17.960 --> 15:20.474
I ever dreamed of, you know?
Pretty, in great shape,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.829
a celebrity...
which could've been great

15:22.870 --> 15:24.735
for my personal training image.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.099
- That is so romantic.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.483
- Yeah. And then
she ruined everything

15:29.530 --> 15:32.055
by DUMPING ME!
- Oh, wow. You're running

15:32.100 --> 15:34.227
a bit hot, huh?
- It's the protein powder.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.443
- Yeah. Sure.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.922
Bingo.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.501
She was gonna introduce me
to her celebrity friends.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.415
I could have really
made something of myself.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.940
- That's just the way
the power bar crumbles.

16:34.990 --> 16:38.551
- Hey, Lance. Does this
look familiar to you?

16:38.600 --> 16:41.205
'Cause it's familiar to _me.
My daughter gave It

16:41.260 --> 16:43.205
to my ex-wife Becca
for Christmas.

16:43.260 --> 16:45.558
- Hey, you're Matt Shade.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.384
Wait.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.216
You two know each other?
- Yeah.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.340
We're private investigators.
We're looking into

16:52.400 --> 16:54.561
a stalking incident directed
at Becca D'Orsay.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.394
- Stalking...

16:56.450 --> 16:58.224
Wait, you think
I'm stalking Becca?!

16:58.270 --> 17:00.226
- Stalkers are known
to covet personal Items

17:00.280 --> 17:02.316
from their victims. _
How do you explaIn thIs?

17:02.360 --> 17:04.237
- But...
- You just admitted you're upset

17:04.280 --> 17:06.271
over Becca dumping you.
- I'm an intense guy!

17:06.320 --> 17:08.584
Women find it sexy.

17:08.630 --> 17:11.975
- No. They don't, Lance.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.066
- OK. OK.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.929
I took the scarf.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.764
The night Becca told me it was
over, I lifted it

17:17.810 --> 17:19.630
from her purse.
But I just wanted to make her

17:19.690 --> 17:21.499
call me looking for it, OK?

17:21.560 --> 17:23.425
Look at me.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.688
I'm not used to rejection.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.778
: Oh, come on!

17:29.830 --> 17:31.775
That guy had motive, opportunity

17:31.830 --> 17:33.786
and he was hoarding a souvenir

17:33.830 --> 17:35.786
of their relationship.
He is suspect number one.

17:35.830 --> 17:37.821
- There's no way that thatguy

17:37.880 --> 17:39.836
had the idea
to look up the details

17:39.880 --> 17:42.098
of Becca's previous stalker
and copy them.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.096
We've gotta
be missing something.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.789
- Well, let's call her and
let her know what's going on.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.886
Ugh! That was couture!

17:50.930 --> 17:53.581
- I... I think you're
missing the point.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.621
We haven't ruled Lance out

17:55.680 --> 17:57.454
as a suspect but he's
definitely not looking

17:57.510 --> 17:59.592
[like a shoe-in
as your stalker.]

17:59.640 --> 18:01.596
I mean, he was

18:01.640 --> 18:03.949
really upset when I told him
that we were through.

18:06.730 --> 18:09.642
Bec?

18:09.690 --> 18:11.476
- Hey!

18:11.520 --> 18:13.476
You OK?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.602
- Inside.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.146
- I feel terrible!

18:30.190 --> 18:33.011
Someone must have stolen
Mrs. D'Orsay's extra fob

18:33.060 --> 18:34.880
when I stepped away
from the security room.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.886
Please, tell her I'm sorry.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.670
- Well, maybe next time
you go for a pee break,

18:39.720 --> 18:41.711
you'll remember to lock the
office. OK? Thanks a lot, Gus.

18:41.770 --> 18:45.285
All right, we're gonna
take the bear and the note

18:45.340 --> 18:47.592
back to the lab, see if we can't
find any trace elements

18:47.640 --> 18:50.689
of the stalker's DNA.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.948
- Seems like he really knew
what he was doing.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.867
Avoided the cameras,
snatched the fob from security.

18:55.910 --> 18:57.958
How's Becca handling this?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.048
- I better go check on her.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.308
- Yeah.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.569
: Mom!

19:05.620 --> 19:07.576
Are you OK?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.394
I can't believe
this is happening.

19:09.450 --> 19:11.350
- I'm fine. Hey, Don.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.184
- Good to see you safe, Becca.

19:13.230 --> 19:15.050
Stay as long as you like.
- Grandpa told me

19:15.110 --> 19:17.362
about the first stalker.
That must have been awful.

19:17.410 --> 19:20.368
- I don't want you to worry
about me. That's my job.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.583
We can talk_about it
In the mornIng, OK?

19:23.640 --> 19:26.541
Right now I just wanna get
some sleep. Put it out
of my mind for a bit.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.114
- OK. Goodnight. Love you.
- Goodnight.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.116
- Night, sweetie.
- Night.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.298
- Hey, this way, honey.
- Thank you.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.729
- Goodnight.
- Night.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.776
- Do you need any help
with those bags?

19:40.830 --> 19:44.345
- No, it's all right, Dad.
I got 'em.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.265
- OK. See you.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.016
A drink, maybe?

19:57.060 --> 20:00.757
- Yeah. Yeah, I could use one.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.986
- You're safe here, Becca.
You know that, right?

20:12.030 --> 20:14.294
- Oh, yeah. I know.

20:14.340 --> 20:17.423
It's not that.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.604
It's just sometimes I wonder
if this is the universe

20:21.650 --> 20:23.993
telling me to get over myself.

20:30.220 --> 20:32.268
- When this happened
the last time,

20:32.310 --> 20:34.835
I was the Channel 3
weather girl.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.314
Perlq and smiling.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.181
Standing in short skirts

20:40.230 --> 20:42.107
next to the big green screen.

20:42.150 --> 20:45.142
And here I am

20:45.200 --> 20:47.498
years later and I'm doing
the exact same thing.

20:49.330 --> 20:51.673
- But you've got
your own show now.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.188
- But is it really
any different?

20:56.860 --> 21:00.159
I try so hard to make it
about real issues, Shadow...

21:00.210 --> 21:03.464
but all anyone wants me to do
is give my opinion

21:03.520 --> 21:05.818
on fashion trends
or workout tIps

21:05.870 --> 21:07.826
or how to stuff a throat pillow.

21:07.870 --> 21:09.826
- But you got
that big interview.

21:09.870 --> 21:11.781
Samantha Bowman's
the real deal, isn't she?

21:11.830 --> 21:14.298
- Yeah.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.487
Yeah, she's amazing.

21:16.530 --> 21:19.226
Did you know that she
implemented a pilot program

21:19.270 --> 21:21.875
in her ward to improve the
quality of curbside recycling?

21:21.930 --> 21:25.013
She held an open bid
and she chose the company

21:25.060 --> 21:28.325
with the greenest profile.
- You did your homework!
- Exactly!

21:28.370 --> 21:30.884
But all Maggie
wants me to ask her

21:30.940 --> 21:33.022
is where she shops
and what she eats

21:33.070 --> 21:35.846
and what the name
of her Labrador retriever is.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.687
How did you do it?

21:42.730 --> 21:45.460
How did you change
who you were and...

21:45.520 --> 21:47.647
and actually make it stick?

21:53.050 --> 21:55.086
- I had help.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.518
- Yeah. Angie's pretty great,
isn't she?

21:59.570 --> 22:02.004
- Don't you dare
tell her I said that.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.703
: OK.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.978
Well, thanks
for letting me know.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.011
Yeah, see you.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.061
Oh, hey! That was Maz.

22:15.110 --> 22:17.419
There was no DNA on
the stuffed animal or the note

22:17.460 --> 22:19.371
left in Becca's apartment.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.240
- So we're back to square one.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.724
- Afraid so.

22:23.770 --> 22:26.421
What's wrong?
- What do you think

22:26.470 --> 22:28.426
the chances are of Maz

22:28.470 --> 22:30.426
actually developing
mad cow disease?

22:30.470 --> 22:33.382
- Well, he told me this story

22:33.430 --> 22:35.386
about him being in the UK
during the epidemic

22:35.440 --> 22:38.170
and I looked it up
and the virus can lay dormant

22:38.220 --> 22:40.085
in your spinal column for years.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.442
What?

22:44.490 --> 22:47.050
- Maz hasn't been
to London, Ontario,

22:47.100 --> 22:48.920
let alone London, England.

22:48.970 --> 22:51.404
He was havin' a laugh,
as they say.

22:51.450 --> 22:53.759
- He lied. Ugh.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.018
I can't believe this.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.153
- Well, what prompted
this little confession of his?

22:59.200 --> 23:02.101
- I went to meet him for dinner.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.628
I suggested we donate blood.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.545
- And he got out
of that one big time.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.727
- Oh, my God.

23:08.770 --> 23:11.238
Is Maz afraid of needles?

23:11.300 --> 23:13.905
- Uh, yeah! Like terrified!

23:13.950 --> 23:15.736
When we were in grade school,

23:15.780 --> 23:19.170
it took both of the gym teachers
and school nurse to wrestle him

23:19.220 --> 23:21.734
into a booster shot.

23:21.790 --> 23:25.009
Mad cow disease.
That's a good one.

23:25.050 --> 23:27.177
- Yeah.

23:27.230 --> 23:30.131
Hilarious.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.709
- Hey. You're up
and dressed early.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.184
- Yeah. Turns out sleeping
wasn't as easy as I thought.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.629
Besides, I have the interview
with Samantha today,

23:40.680 --> 23:42.580
so I wanna get there
and get ready.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.417
- You're gonna get through this,
Becca. You know that, right?

23:45.460 --> 23:48.543
- Of course.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.818
You're trending.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.374
- Yeah, the stalker story.
It's all over

23:53.430 --> 23:56.513
social media.
- Let me see.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.609
- Including the fact that
my previous stalking incident

23:59.650 --> 24:02.039
caused a mental collapse,
forcing me off the air?!

24:02.090 --> 24:05.992
Who would leak
something like that?

24:06.050 --> 24:08.132
- Jules, can you find
who started that?

24:08.180 --> 24:10.228
- Yeah.

24:12.140 --> 24:15.189
Ah, OK. It all started with...
@partlycloudy100.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.753
"Becca D'Orsay has a stalker.
Colour me amazed."

24:26.070 --> 24:28.504
- Take me to the studio. Now!

24:30.460 --> 24:33.247
TINA!

24:33.290 --> 24:35.633
Morning, Hank!

24:35.690 --> 24:38.079
Morning, Missy! Sarah!
Good to see you.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.168
TINA!

24:43.560 --> 24:46.176
What have I told you
about being late, Tina?

24:46.220 --> 24:49.178
- It won't be tolerated,
Ms. D'Orsay.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.092
Ahh.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.395
JEFFREY!
- Ow!

24:58.450 --> 25:01.226
- How dare you expose my
personal struggles on Twitter?!

25:01.280 --> 25:03.316
- I do not know
what you are talking about.

25:03.370 --> 25:06.749
God! You couldn't even

25:06.800 --> 25:08.756
be bothered to come up
with a decent alias?

25:08.810 --> 25:11.893
- Well, I thought you'd
appreciate the shout out.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.067
Every tweet is a good tweet,
as they say.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.894
- Nobody has ever
said that! Ever!

25:15.940 --> 25:17.896
Oh, yeah. If you think

25:17.950 --> 25:19.895
some second-rate
cloud caller lIke you

25:19.950 --> 25:22.464
is gonna rattle my cage
with a cheap move like this?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.647
Did you send the flowers, too?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.681
! Absolutely not.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.822
- But you knew about them.

25:28.870 --> 25:30.735
- Tina told me.
- You're tryIng to wreck

25:30.790 --> 25:32.564
my career because
you're jealous.

25:32.610 --> 25:35.044
Jealous of the big interview,
jealous of the fact

25:35.090 --> 25:37.229
that I made it out of the
weather racket and you didn't.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.784
Oh, please!

25:39.840 --> 25:41.705
- There is a storm front

25:41.750 --> 25:44.662
coming for you, Jeffster.
And it is gonna smack you

25:44.710 --> 25:46.758
right in the...

25:46.800 --> 25:49.883
right in your cheap, little...

25:49.930 --> 25:52.888
- Becca, calm down.
- I can't breathe.

25:52.940 --> 25:55.408
Hey, Becca!

25:55.460 --> 25:57.542
Becca?

25:57.590 --> 25:59.467
Call 911!

25:59.510 --> 26:01.558
Becca? Becca!

26:01.600 --> 26:04.160
Hey! Hey! Look at me! Becca!

26:10.430 --> 26:12.386
- Yes.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.214
This is my ex-husband,

26:14.260 --> 26:16.046
Matt Shade.
- As I suspected, Ms. D'Orsay,

26:16.090 --> 26:18.911
you suffered an anaphylactic
reaction to peanuts.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.781
But that's impossible!

26:21.840 --> 26:23.614
- Becca's known
about her peanut allergy

26:23.660 --> 26:26.094
since she was a little kid.
She's always extremely careful.

26:26.140 --> 26:27.880
_ - And the studio
Is strIctly peanut free.

26:27.930 --> 26:29.886
- Yes, we called them to check
but we also tested the water

26:29.930 --> 26:31.795
you were drinking
before the attack.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.715
It tested positive for peanuts
even though there are none

26:33.760 --> 26:35.716
listed in the ingredients.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.842
- You mean someone laced
my water on purpose?

26:37.900 --> 26:41.245
- The police have been notified.
- Thanks for lettin' us know.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.726
- "If I can't have you,
no one can." Shade...

26:46.770 --> 26:49.295
the stalker's following through
on his promise!

26:49.340 --> 26:51.160
- All right. I'll let Maz know.
Maybe he can

26:51.210 --> 26:53.075
assign an officer to you
at the studio.

26:53.130 --> 26:55.644
!
- Maggie! What are you

26:55.700 --> 26:58.385
doing here?
- Becca! Thank God you're OK.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.170
Oh, I was worried!
- Oh, yeah!

27:01.220 --> 27:04.519
I'm totally fine. And completely
capable to do the show.

27:04.570 --> 27:07.186
- No, no. I just got off
the phone with Simon,

27:07.230 --> 27:10.188
Ms. Bowman's campaign manager.
OK? And given the circumstances,

27:10.230 --> 27:12.016
he thought it best
just to cancel the interview.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.925
- No! No, Maggie, you can't
let them do that!

27:13.980 --> 27:16.847
I've done all this preparation--
- I'm sorry, Becca.

27:16.890 --> 27:18.801
There's nothing I can do.
I scheduled

27:18.850 --> 27:20.806
a rerun for this morning.
Listen, listen.

27:20.850 --> 27:24.195
Down the road, maybe,
if we decide it's a good idea,

27:24.250 --> 27:26.673
we can reschedule it then. OK?

27:26.730 --> 27:29.631
In the meantime, I need you
to rest and look after yourself.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.472
- Becca, this is just temporary.
You know that.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.819
- I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this. I'll call you
when I know somethin'.

27:41.870 --> 27:45.340
- Sure.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.005
- Hey.

27:48.050 --> 27:50.132
- Hey! I got your message.
How's Becca?

27:50.190 --> 27:52.795
- She's demoralized.
Samantha Bowman backed out

27:52.840 --> 27:54.796
of her interview.
- Maz just brought

27:54.840 --> 27:56.796
Becca's_ assistant Tina in
for questIonIng. Zoe's gonna

27:56.840 --> 27:59.491
update us if she hears anything.
- This is serious now, Ange.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.496
We gotta find this guy before
he tries somethin' else.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.065
- I put a timeline together.
It's all the stalker incidents,

28:04.110 --> 28:06.101
people's various alibis,

28:06.160 --> 28:08.765
and any relevant events
in Becca's life.

28:08.810 --> 28:11.506
- So, who's obsessed with Becca
enough to try to take her life?

28:11.550 --> 28:13.506
- I don't think anybody is.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.721
- We already know
the culprit started out

28:17.780 --> 28:20.772
by mimicking the stalker
from years ago. The red roses...

28:20.820 --> 28:22.731
- The pink envelopes,
the notes, yeah.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.953
- So if the new stalker got all
those details off the internet,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.525
they also could have learned
that Becca took time

28:27.570 --> 28:29.526
off work to recover.
- You think the reason

28:29.570 --> 28:31.743
for all this is to try
to keep Becca off the air?

28:31.790 --> 28:34.133
- The Samantha Bowman interview
was scheduled for today,

28:34.190 --> 28:36.613
but now it's canceled.
Check this out.

28:36.670 --> 28:38.615
The flowers showed up
the day after

28:38.670 --> 28:40.922
Becca submitted her questions
for approval.

28:40.980 --> 28:44.279
- Maybe there was somethin' in
those questions the future mayor

28:44.330 --> 28:46.275
didn't want to be asked about.

28:46.330 --> 28:48.412
- We just need to find out what.

28:51.770 --> 28:55.501
- Thank you so much, Detective.

28:55.550 --> 28:58.633
It feels so good to get
all that off my chest.

28:58.690 --> 29:00.817
- It's just part of my job.
It's totally fine.

29:02.430 --> 29:04.773
OK. Yeah.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.775
You take care now.

29:09.130 --> 29:11.086
- That's Becca's assistant.
You're lettIng her go?

29:11.140 --> 29:13.483
- I really should have
been a therapist.

29:13.530 --> 29:15.486
I just spent the last hour
hearing about how Becca

29:15.530 --> 29:17.521
helps her improve
her performance.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.878
- But do you think she had
anything to do with the assault?

29:19.930 --> 29:22.967
- Becca keeps her water in a
mini fridge in her dressing room

29:23.020 --> 29:25.318
with her name on it.
Anybody could have had access.

29:25.370 --> 29:27.326
It's gonna be impossible

29:27.370 --> 29:30.544
to pin somebody down to... that.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.336
What's wrong?

29:37.380 --> 29:40.429
- I'm sorry. I just really wish
we could donate blood together.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.290
I know you're not allowed

29:42.340 --> 29:44.160
and I feel bad

29:44.210 --> 29:47.122
for bringing it up but it's
really important to me.

29:49.350 --> 29:52.865
- Yeah!

29:54.830 --> 29:56.821
In college,

29:56.880 --> 29:58.962
I volunteered at a hospital

29:59.010 --> 30:01.137
and one night, this kid came in

30:01.190 --> 30:03.704
and he'd been in a really bad
car accident and needed blood.

30:03.750 --> 30:06.093
He was 0 negative
and believe it or not,

30:06.150 --> 30:08.106
the hospital was out.

30:08.150 --> 30:11.199
- Oh jeez, that's terrible.
- I know!

30:11.240 --> 30:13.708
But then this guy
in the waiting room

30:13.760 --> 30:15.716
stood up and said,
"I'm 0 negative!"

30:15.770 --> 30:18.284
_ - Wow.
- It's just a SImple act,

30:18.330 --> 30:20.503
but to me, that guy was a hero.

30:20.550 --> 30:23.940
It's not your fault.
I know you'd be a hero

30:23.990 --> 30:28.427
if you could. But... you can't
on account of the cows.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.508
- You know, I actually
talked to my doctor

30:33.570 --> 30:35.868
after we spoke, and...

30:35.920 --> 30:38.434
it turns out they got
the dates wrong. So...

30:38.480 --> 30:40.266
- Well, mad cow disease wasn't

30:40.310 --> 30:42.392
really a thing
when I was in London, so...

30:44.360 --> 30:46.920
Last time I go to that doctor,
right? But, uh...

30:46.970 --> 30:50.269
apparently, uh... I'm good
to go as far as donating.

30:50.320 --> 30:53.232
- That's so great. You know
they're still taking people?

30:53.280 --> 30:56.192
- Great!
- And you even get a free donut
and a glass of orange juice.

30:56.240 --> 30:59.630
- Lucky! OK!

30:59.680 --> 31:01.898
Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! Nice!
Wonderful! Thank you!

31:01.940 --> 31:04.591
- OK.
- All right!

31:06.600 --> 31:08.500
: Turns out politics
isn't very interesting

31:08.560 --> 31:10.983
without the scandals.
- There's gotta be something

31:11.040 --> 31:12.996
in these questions
that made Samantha back out

31:13.040 --> 31:14.905
of the interview.
- Becca wasn't exactly

31:14.960 --> 31:17.906
going for zingers.
Topics of the interview include:

31:17.960 --> 31:20.428
Samantha's love of knitting,

31:20.480 --> 31:22.562
her two dogs, the heartbreak

31:22.610 --> 31:25.170
of selling her family cottage.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.915
The recycling program
that took place in her ward.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.097
- Well, it's not exactly
breaking news. The contract

31:30.140 --> 31:32.051
was awarded six months ago.
- Exactly. No one else

31:32.100 --> 31:34.409
is asking about it
because it's a done deal.

31:34.450 --> 31:36.918
Maybe Becca inadvertently
picked at an old wound.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.448
- Yeah. It may be worth
a fishing expedition.

31:39.500 --> 31:42.060
- It's the only nibble
we've got.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.670
- Let's check out
the recycling company.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.336
- Yeah. Totally. Top notch.

31:54.390 --> 31:57.814
Just marveling
at the intricate process

31:57.870 --> 32:00.122
involved in jabbing
a metal tube in one's arm

32:00.170 --> 32:02.218
and then extracting the fluid
necessary to sustain human life.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.656
Let's not do this.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.656
- Sorry.

32:10.710 --> 32:13.099
Sorry. No, it's fine.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.096
It's important to you.
We can do it.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.448
It's just a needle, right? Takes
30 seconds. Goes in and out.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.445
Right?
- Well, actually it takes

32:19.500 --> 32:21.582
about eight minutes.

32:23.890 --> 32:25.846
- OK, Maz. Really,
we can come back.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.061
- It's fine. Ijust
have to concentrate

32:30.120 --> 32:32.281
on not dying.
- OK.

32:32.340 --> 32:35.764
Next.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.981
Detective?
- Yeah.

32:40.340 --> 32:42.649
- I'm a detective.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.954
- I am a cop and detective.
- OK, wait, stop. Get away

32:45.000 --> 32:48.913
from him. Sorry.
- It's fine.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.611
- I'm sorry!

32:51.660 --> 32:53.616
I knew you lied about mad cow

32:53.660 --> 32:55.571
and I thought I could trick you

32:55.620 --> 32:58.532
into giving blood
and overcome your fear

32:58.580 --> 33:01.140
by telling you
the hospital story.

33:01.190 --> 33:03.146
Which was stupid

33:03.190 --> 33:06.193
because you clearly
do have a phobia

33:06.240 --> 33:08.014
and I totally underestimated it.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.538
- You made up the hospital story

33:10.590 --> 33:13.548
in order to help me get over
my fear of needles?

33:13.600 --> 33:16.376
- I know._I'm the worst
gIrlfrIend ever.

33:16.420 --> 33:18.206
- It's actually kind of sweet.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.718
I mean, I shouldn't
have lied to you

33:20.780 --> 33:22.725
in the first place.

33:22.780 --> 33:25.510
I mean, mad cow disease?

33:25.560 --> 33:27.346
I was dead in the water.

33:27.390 --> 33:29.438
Thank you for letting me
get away with that one.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.529
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.923
You totally do not have
to go through with this.

33:40.970 --> 33:43.404
- No, I... want to.

33:43.450 --> 33:46.499
As long as you're here with me.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.322
I might throw up on you.

33:50.370 --> 33:53.976
- That would be unfortunate.

33:56.070 --> 33:58.026
: According to news
reports from six months ago,

33:58.070 --> 34:00.072
five companies were given
the opportunity to bid

34:00.120 --> 34:03.419
on the recycling contract.
It was eventually awarded

34:03.470 --> 34:05.426
to a newcomer,
Trafalgar Recycling.

34:05.470 --> 34:07.938
- Never heard of 'em.
- The CEO is listed as...

34:08.000 --> 34:09.774
Huh. That's weird.

34:09.830 --> 34:13.049
- Well, back when this was
published, the CEO was this guy,

34:13.090 --> 34:16.605
Jason Phillips, but now he's
not on the website aanhere.

34:16.660 --> 34:19.094
- Well, maybe he got fired.
- Six months after scoring

34:19.140 --> 34:21.529
the largest contract
in the company's history?

34:21.580 --> 34:23.969
- That is a little odd.

34:24.010 --> 34:26.968
- Yeah! Somethin' stinks...
and it ain't the recycling.

34:27.020 --> 34:30.148
- I'm thinkin' maybe we should
have a little chat with
Mr. Phillips.

34:30.190 --> 34:33.535
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:33.590 --> 34:35.490
- Do you know who says
things like that?

34:35.550 --> 34:37.359
People who did something wrong.

34:37.420 --> 34:39.194
- How did you lose your job

34:39.250 --> 34:41.059
as CEO of Trafalgar Recycling?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.634
- I can't talk about it.
- Well, you can talk to us

34:43.690 --> 34:46.113
or you can talk to the cops.
Your choice.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.070
- Look, I was
just the front man.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.907
- All I had to do was smile

34:50.950 --> 34:52.906
and say the right things
on camera and when the deal

34:52.960 --> 34:54.905
was awarded,
I got paid and left.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.916
- You're saying that Trafalgar
paid you to be pretend CEO.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.916
Why would they do that?

34:58.960 --> 35:01.872
- You don't get it.
There is no Trafalgar.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.831
- But their website is--

35:03.880 --> 35:05.700
- Is fake, along with
everything else.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.615
The carbon neutral
processmg plant,

35:07.670 --> 35:09.444
the hybrid electric
recycling trucks,

35:09.490 --> 35:11.538
the forest restoration project,

35:11.580 --> 35:14.014
they just did whatever
they needed to to win the bid.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.494
- Grand Ridge Waste Management.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.508
- I know that name.
They were in the news

35:22.550 --> 35:24.802
for dumping toxic waste
in the lake a couple years ago.

35:24.860 --> 35:26.760
- Who at Grand Ridge
actually hired you?

35:26.820 --> 35:28.594
- It wasn't them.
It was some other guy.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.369
I don't know his name.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.159
He wired me the fee.

35:32.210 --> 35:34.166
- Fine.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.770
Don't leave town.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.732
What do you think?
- I think Samantha Bowman's

35:41.790 --> 35:43.746
got some explaining to do.

35:43.790 --> 35:45.746
- Why would she rig
her own pilot recycling project?

35:45.790 --> 35:49.180
Takes cash_
to run a campaIgn.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.357
- Grand Ridge does
have deep pockets.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.480
- Not to mention it'd give them
an in with the future mayor.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.236
- I'm really starting to regret
admiring that woman.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.060
: You sure about this?
: Sort of.

36:05.110 --> 36:07.112
But we haven't been able
to ﬁnd any concrete eVIdence

36:07.160 --> 36:08.980
that Grand Ridge rigged the bid

36:09.030 --> 36:12.079
or that Samantha took a kickback
from it, but a backroom deal

36:12.120 --> 36:14.202
would explain why she wanted
to cancel the interview.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.946
- I can't believe this.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.809
I was her biggest supporter!

36:18.870 --> 36:21.646
- I'm sorry, Becca.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.645
- Well, this really
changes everything.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.303
- An hour ago I called
Samantha personally

36:28.360 --> 36:30.225
and begged her to reinstate
the interview.

36:30.270 --> 36:33.319
She agreed. We're going live
in 20 minutes.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.227
- Are you planning
on confronting her?
- You're damn right I am!

36:36.280 --> 36:38.089
We don't have any evidence yet.

36:38.150 --> 36:40.755
- And didn't you just say
that Angie's getting some?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.665
- Yeah, but what if she doesn't
get it in time? Think about

36:42.720 --> 36:45.280
this, Becca. If you're wrong,
it could ruin your career!

36:47.370 --> 36:49.418
If she did a dirty deal
with municipal money

36:49.460 --> 36:52.020
to get a kickback for
her campaign and I sat there

36:52.070 --> 36:53.947
with her talking
about fruit smoothies,

36:53.990 --> 36:55.810
I'd look like an idiot.

36:55.860 --> 36:59.079
- Makeup's asking
for you Ms. D'Orsay.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.554
- I'll be right there.

37:09.310 --> 37:12.609
- Welcome to Breakfast
with Becca.We are live today

37:12.660 --> 37:15.390
with an exclusive one_-on-one
WIth mayoral candIdate

37:15.450 --> 37:17.259
Samantha Bowman.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.129
Welcome, Samantha.
- Thank you.

37:19.190 --> 37:21.146
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, isn't that nice

37:21.190 --> 37:23.442
of you to say! Thank you.
- First question.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.104
Who are you wearing?

37:26.850 --> 37:29.102
: Not yet,
but when I was staking out

37:29.150 --> 37:31.232
Grand Ridge, I saw a bunch
of their dump trucks headed

37:31.290 --> 37:33.155
to the Port Lands.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.986
It seemed odd.
I'm following one now.

37:35.030 --> 37:36.895
- Keep me up to date.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.759
- I'd like to talk to you

37:38.820 --> 37:40.811
about the recycling program
in your home ward.

37:40.860 --> 37:43.169
- Yes. Now, that's a cause

37:43.210 --> 37:45.770
that's very near
and dear to my heart.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.993
We engaged a company
called Trafalgar

37:48.040 --> 37:49.735
with a commitment to efficient

37:49.780 --> 37:52.476
and affordable waste management.

37:52.530 --> 37:54.475
- And this is the CEO

37:54.530 --> 37:56.612
of Trafalgar

37:56.660 --> 38:00.187
- I don't know, actually.
I've never met him personally.

38:00.230 --> 38:02.278
: What is
she doing!

38:02.320 --> 38:04.402
: Is there a reason
you brought him up?

38:10.540 --> 38:13.498
- Jason Phillips isn't
who you think he is, Ms. Bowman.

38:13.550 --> 38:16.189
He was hired to pose as the CEO

38:16.250 --> 38:19.060
of Trafalgar just long enough
to win the bid

38:19.120 --> 38:21.020
for the recycling contract
in your ward.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.809
In fact,

38:22.860 --> 38:24.771
Trafalgar doesn't even exist.

38:24.820 --> 38:27.380
It was an elaborate front
for the true reCIpIent

38:27.430 --> 38:31.036
of the contract,
Grand Ridge Waste Management.

38:31.090 --> 38:34.048
Can you explain that?
- I have no idea

38:34.090 --> 38:36.046
what you're talking about.

38:36.090 --> 38:38.877
- No.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.616
As far as I'm aware,
Trafalgar won that bid

38:41.660 --> 38:44.049
fair and square.
If there's any deception,

38:44.100 --> 38:46.739
I certainly don't know about it.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.054
- Please tell me_
you found somethIng.

38:53.110 --> 38:55.066
- You're not gonna believe
what I'm seeing right now.

38:55.110 --> 38:57.806
I'm sending you a video.
Just stand by.

38:57.850 --> 39:01.115
- You said a moment ago that
you never met Jason Phillips.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.118
Why is that?
- Because I wasn't personally

39:04.160 --> 39:06.299
involved in vetting
the candidates.

39:06.340 --> 39:09.685
That was handled by my chief of
staff, now my campaign manager,

39:09.730 --> 39:13.382
Simon Murphy.

39:13.430 --> 39:16.308
- Hey Fred, can you swing
camera two around

39:16.350 --> 39:18.523
to get Mr. Simon Murphy, please?

39:18.570 --> 39:20.265
- What the hell
is happening here?

39:20.310 --> 39:22.358
- Mr. Murphy,
were you responsible

39:22.400 --> 39:24.129
for the backroom deal
that resulted in Grand Ridge

39:24.180 --> 39:26.967
Waste Management being awarded
the recycling contract

39:27.010 --> 39:29.262
in Ward 52? And for posing

39:29.320 --> 39:31.959
as my former stalker
and for trying

39:32.020 --> 39:34.796
to poison me in order to scare
me out of doing this interview?

39:37.200 --> 39:40.670
- That is ridiculous. Samantha,
you know this isn't true.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.371
- You'd better have proof
of this, Ms. D'Orsay.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.638
- OK. OK. Just cut
to a commercial. Right now!

39:45.680 --> 39:48.148
- No. No, wait. Put this
on the screen.

40:05.880 --> 40:09.441
- Oh, my God. Are they just
dumping waste into the woods?!

40:09.490 --> 40:12.129
- That's what it
looks like to me.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.181
Please tell me that what I'm
seeIng and hearIng Isn't true.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.323
- We needed money
for the campaign, Samantha.

40:21.370 --> 40:24.157
Grand Ridge was offering--
- I don't care what they
were offering.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.282
Look at what they're doing.

40:26.330 --> 40:28.286
You took something

40:28.330 --> 40:30.412
that was important to me
and you destroyed it!

40:30.470 --> 40:34.076
- Samantha--
- No! Ms. D'Orsay, I am so,

40:34.120 --> 40:37.419
so, very sorry about this,

40:37.470 --> 40:40.644
and I wanna make it_clear
to everyone watchIng

40:40.690 --> 40:43.432
that I take full responsibility
for what happened.

40:43.480 --> 40:46.654
I will get to the bottom of this
and I will make sure

40:46.700 --> 40:48.565
that it never happens again.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.485
And that's a promise.

40:50.530 --> 40:53.442
- Well, you heard it here first.
We'll be right back

40:53.490 --> 40:55.879
after these very important
messages from our sponsors.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.490
- Well, Maggie looks happy.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.677
- Nothing like a takedown

41:08.720 --> 41:10.984
on live television
to drIve up the ratIngs.

41:11.030 --> 41:13.851
- Simon's denying it, of course,
but with all the execs

41:13.900 --> 41:15.891
at Grand Ridge rushing
to point fingers, the proof

41:15.950 --> 41:18.111
will be out soon enough.
- Plus, there's surveillance

41:18.170 --> 41:20.513
video of Simon's car parked
down the street from your condo.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.380
- You know what I still
can't ﬁgure out? How he got

41:22.430 --> 41:24.386
your credit card number.
- I made a contribution

41:24.430 --> 41:26.648
to Samantha's campaign
three months ago.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.509
He had it the whole time.

41:28.570 --> 41:32.210
- Simon can run... a campaign,
that is, but he can't hide.

41:32.270 --> 41:34.613
- How long you been
sittin' on that one?

41:34.660 --> 41:37.390
- Oh, my God! Bec!

41:37.450 --> 41:39.918
The head of the network
was watching

41:39.970 --> 41:41.881
and she wants to_talk
about tranSItIonIng

41:41.930 --> 41:44.273
Breakfast with Becca
into a mixed-format

41:44.320 --> 41:47.539
of news and talk!

41:47.590 --> 41:50.229
- Yes, I'm serious!
- Look out, Katie Couric!

41:50.290 --> 41:52.508
- And Matt, don't think
that this counts

41:52.550 --> 41:55.246
as an appearance because
I'm still comin' after you.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.556
- Well, congratulations, Becca.
You deserve this.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.592
- Well, none of this would have
happened without the two of you.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.686
And thanks so much
for your help, Shadow.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.733
You were really there for me
when I needed you.

42:07.780 --> 42:11.216
- Yeah. What are ex-husbands
for? I'll tell Jules
everything's OK.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.728
- Well, I better
get back to work!

42:13.790 --> 42:16.350
I'm researching a piece
on climate change called

42:16.400 --> 42:19.619
Don't Sweat It: Fighting Global Warming Through Fashion.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.312
Tina? TINA!

42:29.450 --> 42:31.361
- It looks fine.

42:31.410 --> 42:33.549
- It's not clotting.
What's it called when your blood

42:33.590 --> 42:35.672
doesn't clot?
HemophIIIa?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.676
- Yeah.
- You do not... no, you do not

42:37.720 --> 42:39.631
have hemophilia.
- Well, Maz, did you really

42:39.680 --> 42:42.285
overcome your mortal fear
of needles to give blood?

42:42.340 --> 42:45.298
- He was incredibly brave
and only bit the nurse twice.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.513
- Oh, she had that coming.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.460
- Hey, we're gonna go grab
some food. You guys wanna join?

42:49.520 --> 42:52.387
- No, thanks. I gotta get home.
- I'll take a rain check.

42:52.430 --> 42:54.386
Not hungry?
- EW! '

42:54.440 --> 42:56.476
- All right. See you tomorrow.

43:02.530 --> 43:04.486
- Watching you do hot yoga.

43:04.530 --> 43:08.091
Why would you...
Ah. Where you goin'?

43:08.150 --> 43:10.220
- None of your business!

43:10.280 --> 43:12.669
But don't wait up.

43:15.590 --> 43:18.809
- Wow. I did not
see that comin'.
