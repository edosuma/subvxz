- DEAN: We grab Satan...
- Gents.

up a

(GRU NTS)

00:16.120 --> 00:17.144
Right.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.219

we get Jack, and we get out.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.106

Mary,

29:27.320 --> 29:28.981
your world's got your boys.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.057
This place?

29:31.640 --> 29:32.629
(SIGHS SOFI'LY)

29:33.280 --> 29:34.861
I'm pretty much all it's got.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.501
CHILDREN: Whoa!

29:44.720 --> 29:46.347
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

29:48.280 --> 29:50.783
What is he? A witch? Psychic?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.303
Jack's a Nephilim.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.999
Excuse me?

30:01.240 --> 30:04.380
He's half-angel, half--

30:04.480 --> 30:06.186
I know what it means.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.940
What I don't get is why the hell
you would bring one into my camp.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.425
You know what angels have done to us.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.583
I... I trusted you.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.301
I want him gone by morning.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.022
If he goes,

30:23.360 --> 30:24.543
I go with him.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.620
Well, then that's your choice.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.897
Yeah.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.546
Look, Mary, when this all started,

30:35.720 --> 30:38.985
when Lucifer and his demon army
rose out of hell,

30:40.240 --> 30:42.504
we thought the angels were on our side.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.462
Well, one by one, they turned on us.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.777
He will, too.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.460
It's just a matter of time.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.599
All right, what else do we know

30:57.680 --> 31:01.025
besides all work and no play
makes Donatello a homicidal boy?

31:01.360 --> 31:05.308
Maybe... Well, maybe something
in the tablet snapped him.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.585
No, no. Prophets are conduits.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.501
Whatever's in the tablet
should just flow through them.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.577
I heard of one who was tempted once,
but never fully corrupted.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.179
Well, Kevin translated it,
and it was hard on him, sure,

31:18.280 --> 31:20.066
but he never went full-on psycho.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.340
Okay, so what was different
about Donatello?

31:26.320 --> 31:27.423
He doesn't have a soul.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.509
What?

31:29.960 --> 31:31.029
Is that bad?

31:32.040 --> 31:33.143
Yes, that's bad.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.225
Theoretically, the human soul

31:36.320 --> 31:38.299
would act as a filter,
inoculating the prophet

31:38.400 --> 31:40.743
against whatever darkness
is in the tablet.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.097
All right. Well, how do we fix him?

31:44.960 --> 31:46.097
I don't think we do.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.738
Okay. Hold on.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.269
We were so close.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.665
(SCOFFS) We almost had it.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.457
What are you talkin' about?

31:58.840 --> 32:00.182
Our plan, Dean.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.066
The spell, get Mom back.
Donatello's soul is gone.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.788
That's not just something
you come back from.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.344
- You did.
- Yeah, because you convinced Death

32:08.440 --> 32:10.385
to get my soul back from the cage,

32:10.480 --> 32:13.040
but Amara ate Donatello's soul.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.105
There's nothing to get back. It's gone.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.221
And Donatello's already corrupted.

32:18.320 --> 32:22.825
I... Perhaps the kindest thing to do
would be to end his suffering.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.229
What?

32:25.720 --> 32:26.857
I don't like it either.

32:27.920 --> 32:31.504
But if Donatello's life ends,
then another prophet comes into being

32:31.600 --> 32:33.465
and they can finish the translation.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.300
- So what, you just wanna kill him?
- No! No killing!

32:38.480 --> 32:39.947
We just need the Spell.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.909
What are you doing?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.182
What I have to.

32:54.920 --> 32:55.989
Hey.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.149
Cass!

33:00.360 --> 33:01.384
DEAN: Cass.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.584
- Cass.
- Cass.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.065
Cass! Come on, let us in!

33:06.160 --> 33:07.422
Cass!

33:08.280 --> 33:09.269
Come on.

33:26.760 --> 33:27.943
You really like it here.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.703
These people,

33:30.720 --> 33:32.039
everyone's so brave.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.119
But we can't stay.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.617
Why not?

33:41.200 --> 33:42.462
Because of me?

33:43.320 --> 33:45.880
I'm sorry, Jack. It's not fair.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.741
The spell to open the gate,
you gave us the wrong ingredients.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.299
(HUFFS) Duh.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.707
But you know the right ones.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.519
I might.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.587
But like I told Sam and Dean,
you're wasting your time.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.146
Well, I'm not Sam and Dean.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.097
What are you gonna do?

34:39.600 --> 34:43.582
I am going to do something that
I promised I would never do

34:43.680 --> 34:45.705
to a human being
without their permission.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.504
I'm gonna strip the Spell
from your mind.

34:49.640 --> 34:52.586
(STU'I'I'ERS) You can't.
I've absorbed too much power.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.466
You'll fry us both!

34:55.280 --> 34:56.349
I might.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.547
Must've been how they found us.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.097
I didn't... I didn't mean to.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.100
Well, ain't that just gravy.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.177
What can we do to help?

35:39.280 --> 35:40.907
Here. Take this.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.820
There's a grain cellar,
escape tunnels running underneath.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.338
Round up any kids you can find,
get 'em safe.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.017
I'll come with you.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.668
You've done enough.

Jack, the angels,

35:56.160 --> 36:00.039
we can't let them find you,
so just find some place and hide.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.549
(SOFI'LY) Okay.

Well, I don't know what to say
except thank you.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.664
Jack, what you did was amazing.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.542
I had to come back.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.782
Sam and Dean, they wouldn't run.

38:44.840 --> 38:45.977
They'd stay and fight.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.984
These angels, what they're doing,
they're not gonna stop.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.067
As long as Michael's out there,

38:52.080 --> 38:53.581
this war will never be over.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.587
So what are you saying?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.302
I have to kill him.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.109
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

39:20.480 --> 39:21.663
Well?

39:26.840 --> 39:28.057
SAM: Well...

39:29.720 --> 39:31.699
Guess you could say Donatello is alive.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.839
You told me not to kill him.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.340
Yeah, but, Cass, you turned him in...

39:39.560 --> 39:40.584
He's brain-dead.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.785
Machines keeping him breathing.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.583
What's wrong with you?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.380
- Nothing.
- Cass--

39:48.480 --> 39:50.903
His soul was gone. He was corrupted.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.266
He was a danger to himself
and to you and to all of humanity.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.227
Did you know that he was
working with Asmodeus?

40:01.840 --> 40:04.058
What? No.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.701
Not by choice, but he was.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.026
Some people just can't be saved.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.299
Yeah, but who gets to
make that choice? You?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.937
What exactly gives you the right?

40:18.160 --> 40:21.061
Nothing. I took it.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.659
And if I hadn't acted,
we would still be sitting around

40:23.760 --> 40:25.625
and talking about what to do next.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.585
We would be wasting time.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.459
And it's time we don't have, Dean.

40:30.560 --> 40:33.506
I told you, war is coming.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.577
War.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.222
And I did what soldiers do.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.823
Now we needed the spell
to open the rift,

40:43.400 --> 40:44.537
and I got it.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.427
We need four major ingredients.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.181
The grace of an archangel.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.901
A fruit from the Tree of Life.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.257
The Sea! of Solomon.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.904
And the blood of a most holy man.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.462
We find those things,

41:08.520 --> 41:09.908
we can bring everybody home.

41:10.520 --> 41:14.581
And together, we can beat
Lucifer and Michael.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.839
This is the only way we win,

41:20.280 --> 41:23.465
and this is the only way we survive.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.107
It's like you said, Dean.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.542
Whatever it takes.
