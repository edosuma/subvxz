00:04.046 --> 00:05.923
I will turn myself in.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.676
-I'm looking for Dr. Asher.
-She hasn't come in yet.

00:08.968 --> 00:11.220
My phone crashed on me,
and I had to get it fixed.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.681
-And I caught a flat.
-You expect me to believe that?

00:13.931 --> 00:15.808
HANNAH: You didn't seem to have
a problem last night.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.310
Your patient and her baby
almost died today,

00:18.394 --> 00:19.645
while you were off somewhere getting high.

00:19.729 --> 00:20.896
You think whatever you want to.

00:22.940 --> 00:23.983
-Yeah, what do you need?
-A favor.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.276
(BARKING)

00:25.359 --> 00:27.945
That was a mistake thinking
you'd turn yourself in.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.989
WILL: Hey, how's your
hormone therapy going?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.991
It feels like my skin
is crawling with ants.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.995
How lucky am I to have found you?
You give me hope, Ben.

00:39.874 --> 00:44.253
All right, Maggie, the radiologist should
read your scans sometime today,

00:44.336 --> 00:45.463
so that just leaves your labs.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.465
Come back at 6:00 p.m. for a blood draw.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.842
Okay, yeah. Thanks.
Ooh, Dr. Singh?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.430
The results, how soon?

00:54.513 --> 00:56.432
I'll ask the lab to put a rush on it.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.601
Yeah...

00:58.684 --> 01:01.479
The wait is hell, I know.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.147
-Yeah.
-But I got a good feeling.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.315
Yeah.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.443
I'm not worried.

01:10.946 --> 01:15.117
Hey. I gotta get to work. See you at 6:00.

01:15.201 --> 01:16.452
Okay.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.959
Wait. Your bowling
semi-finals are tonight.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.962
You should go. I can handle this alone.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.132
Nah, I'm gonna skip. I wanna be there.

01:30.216 --> 01:32.802
Are you kidding? Your team needs you.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.304
-Go.
-Baby, don't sweat it.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.847
They'll call in an alternate.

01:36.931 --> 01:40.309
I said I'll be fine. Okay? Just...

01:41.268 --> 01:42.686
What's up?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.688
Why are you boxing me out all of a sudden?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.357
-I'm not boxing you out.
-You are.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.858
Just...

01:49.610 --> 01:51.987
Just, don't miss your game, okay?

01:52.071 --> 01:54.323
I'll be there as soon as I can
after my appointment.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.242
I gotta get back to the ED.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.667
Word is, Doc Crock's fooling around
with Lena Maynor. CT Tech.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.837
Funny, I heard he was hooking up
with Camille in the pharmacy.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.673

02:12.591 --> 02:14.677
Don't you all have anything
better to do?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.221
Morning, Sexton.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.431
Mags, I think I left my badge in the car.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.809
-I'll be right back.
-All right. Make it snappy.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.311
You okay?

02:24.395 --> 02:26.647
Yeah. Why do I care who he sees?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.986
Don't forget, appointment
with Dr. Patchefsky tonight.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.237
See how many eggs fertilized.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.073
You mean if any eggs fertilized.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.659
After, I was thinking we can grab dinner
at Galit,

02:39.243 --> 02:40.244
celebrate.

but I'd call it fate.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.848
Your shift started an hour ago.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.309
What, did you have
one too many bourbons last night?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.060
Didn't know you were
punching my time card,

03:05.144 --> 03:07.313
but no, actually.
Not this time.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.274
Left my badge in the car. Again.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.484
Should probably
super glue it to my forehead.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.320
Stapler would work, too.

She's bleeding real bad!

03:27.166 --> 03:28.292
Yeah. Yeah.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.544
Did she have problems with her pregnancy
before today?

03:30.628 --> 03:32.004
Not sure.

-I said get in!

-Sit down.
-Okay. Easy.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.697
Easy.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.810
-Hand me that paintbrush.
-Okay.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.693
I need you to lift your leg for me, okay?

04:49.665 --> 04:51.333
That's too tight, damn it!

04:51.417 --> 04:53.460
Any looser, and you'll
bleed out in minutes.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.630
Look, if he doesn't get surgery,
he's gonna lose his leg.

up on Cermak, Jimmy?

here to see Dr. Hannah Asher.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.499
What dose of methadone is Dr. Asher on?
She's sick as a dog.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.167
She's being tapered way too fast.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.668

for medical staff.

she's gotta go cold-turkey?

for a living donor transplant next week,

they may move it up to today.

They found you a donor? That's great.

Last time you were here,
you were still waiting on the list.

07:42.087 --> 07:46.466
I found my own, actually.

I didn't know you were adopted.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.209

08:20.292 --> 08:23.337
Because methadone and suboxone
are technically opiates,

08:23.420 --> 08:26.423
the concern is they're gonna
cause impairment on the job.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.885
But doctors can take depression meds
and sleeping pills?

08:29.968 --> 08:32.721
And residents can work 30-hour shifts?
Where's the concern there?

08:32.804 --> 08:35.349

08:35.432 --> 08:37.017
No, you know what? It's inhumane.

because of the stigma.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.746
Okay.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.249
Hi there. So, other than
the dizziness and headache,

09:42.332 --> 09:44.543
anything else bothering you?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.169
Stomach doesn't feel so great.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.715
Heart rate's a bit elevated.
I'm thinking you're dehydrated.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.384
Any chance you had
a few drinks last night?

09:54.261 --> 09:57.931
Maybe a couple. But nothing crazy.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.143
Look, you're in college,
you wanna try new things,

10:01.226 --> 10:02.978
I completely get it, but you know,

10:03.061 --> 10:06.106
you gotta be really careful mixing alcohol
and antipsychotics, right?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.983
-What are you taking right now?
-Nothing.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.152
I'm not taking risperidone anymore.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.862
I haven't taken it for months, actually.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.407
Krista, it's really important
you remain compliant with your meds...

10:15.490 --> 10:18.952
It makes me feel numb. Less creative.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.663
What, so, you're just symptom free?

10:21.747 --> 10:24.708
Yeah, totally. Never felt better.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.171
Okay. I wanna talk about
this more a little later.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.715
But in the meantime,
let's get you feeling better.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.885
Yeah, CBC, BMP,
hang a normal liter of saline,

10:49.107 --> 10:50.734
Fine. You can call her.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.738
Okay. I'll be back in a bit.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.664
All right. Make sure you keep
his leg elevated until I get back.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.124
-Okay.
-DRIVER: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.377
She comes with me, you stay here.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.045
Listen, I'm the surgeon.
I know what to get.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.630
Cuff him. Catch.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.174
Come on, do it!

11:14.800 --> 11:15.801
Okay.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.135
Let's go!

11:18.762 --> 11:19.805
I'm sorry.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.185
No, no. Hands above his head. That bar.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.437
(SIGHS)

11:27.521 --> 11:28.522
Okay.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.737
It's all right.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.825
All right, all right. Cover your hands.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.665
Come on.

11:50.836 --> 11:51.920
Move.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.590
That your boy on your arm?

12:36.673 --> 12:37.716

-You just keep...
-How old is he?

12:56.818 --> 12:57.819
Move!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.866
-What the hell did you do to him?
-Nothing! He just passed out.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.409
What the hell you doing?

13:05.994 --> 13:08.747
See? He's alive, okay?

13:09.539 --> 13:10.540
Bro?

13:13.043 --> 13:15.504
His calf is rock solid. We need to move.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.172
I need my hands to work, man.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.090
Come on. Pull around the corner.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.260
-Over there.
-Okay. Okay.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.769
Hey, Miss Hill. I'm Dr. Choi.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.313
How's my daughter? Is she doing okay?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.732
I told Jasmine
that I would watch the boys,

13:35.815 --> 13:38.527
so she could rest up till the transplant,
but that girl,

13:38.610 --> 13:40.403
she thinks she's superwoman,
I swear.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.532
So, they're getting her ready for surgery?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.075
Yeah, the transplant team is just

13:45.158 --> 13:47.077
running some tests to ensure
everything goes smoothly.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.164
Oh, it's gonna go smoothly.
Been praying on it since I got the call.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.916
I like your attitude.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.460
And while they finish up with Jasmine,

13:55.544 --> 13:57.462
I just need to check your BP,
if you don't mind.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.588
Not at all.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.799
I heard your story.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.301
Pretty incredible being reunited
with your daughter

14:03.385 --> 14:04.678
under the circumstances.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.889
God works in mysterious ways,
and I've learned not to question Him.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.601
Your hard work paid off. BP's improved.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.019
Amen!

14:15.814 --> 14:20.569
Miss Hill, your chart says you had
an episode of malignant hyperthermia?

14:21.403 --> 14:25.574
When I got foot surgery a few years back.
That drug...

14:26.241 --> 14:28.577
I forget the name... Succinylcholine.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.163
I had a real bad reaction to it.

14:32.247 --> 14:35.917
But they said I could still
donate to Jasmine...

14:36.001 --> 14:38.086
I just have to use
a different anesthesia, right?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.047
That's correct. Just double checking.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.384
Excuse me.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.721
I have been calling
and texting you nonstop!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.098
You're supposed to come home every night,
no exceptions...

14:50.181 --> 14:51.808
Mom, chill! I was busy studying.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.060
I was about to call the police.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.395
You see what I'm talking about?

14:55.979 --> 14:58.023
How about we let Krista rest a bit?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.525
-I'm gonna go get you some food.
-Okay.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.902
I bet you've been living
on vending machine crap.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.321
-Don't you know...
-I will be right back.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.655
You know me so well.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.411
Joanne? Look, I don't wanna overstep,

15:11.494 --> 15:13.747
but sometimes, when we loosen
the reigns a bit...

15:13.830 --> 15:16.791
Loosen the reigns, like what?

15:16.875 --> 15:17.876
Let her drink?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.253
Krista's no longer a minor.
I'm not at liberty to discuss...

15:20.337 --> 15:23.965
Don't give me that.
She is a week over 18.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.551
Dr. Charles. Some help in here.

Honey? Oh, my God!

15:30.722 --> 15:33.099
-Two of Ativan.
-What's wrong with her?

15:33.183 --> 15:35.101
Having a seizure.
Has she ever had one before?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.394
No, never.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.229
DANIEL: Okay, so, give me a BMP, a CBC,

15:38.313 --> 15:42.150
a head CT, EKG and a urine tox.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.235
-Copy that. Mmm-hmm.
-Also, an EEG.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.156
-(GRUNTING)
-Shh.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.539
Wait, you don't think Annette is Jasmine's
biological mother?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.917
Malignant hypothermia
is a genetic disorder.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.295
If Annette can't tolerate succinylcholine,
Jasmine shouldn't be able to, either.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.298
But I checked Jasmine's chart,
they used it in her previous surgeries.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.051
Yeah, but look,
the transplant team didn't flag it.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.096
Are we really gonna jeopardize
Jasmine's life over a possibility?

16:13.139 --> 16:16.351
If it were me on that gurney,
I'd at least wanna know.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.477
Look, Ethan, wait.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.938
If Annette changes her mind,

16:20.021 --> 16:23.316
that is it for Jasmine.
She doesn't have any time left.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.485
Think of her boys.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.280
Please, you don't have to do this.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.701
Krista's EEG is normal.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.911
No epileptiform activity.
She didn't have a seizure.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.789
So, we're looking at what, dyskinesia?

16:37.872 --> 16:40.500
Right. CT was normal as well.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.043
No previous signs of strokes.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.003
Yeah, it can also be caused by
a drug interaction.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.464
Urine tox is clean.
It's not dyskinesia.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.007
Unless,

16:49.467 --> 16:50.719
you gave her metoclopramide

16:50.802 --> 16:51.845
-for the nausea, right?
-Yeah.

16:51.928 --> 16:55.223
-How much?
-Two milligrams, why?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.853
I'm gonna order a couple more labs.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.775
Hey, Doris? I got a peds patient
in Treatment 2.

-Peds? Where's Dr. Manning?

and now, Nat's late with no call-in.
It's not like her.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.994

I just passed it.

She's not picking up her phone.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.915
Can you track her location
on "Drop A Pin"?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.041
Yeah.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.588
That's weird.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.841
It says that she's been just outside
of the hospital for the last hour.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.218

17:34.137 --> 17:35.847

right here.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.059

the back end of the south parking lot.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.211

18:48.294 --> 18:50.797
No. There's a blind spot.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.966
Thank you.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.304
Two of my doctors are missing.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.516
Possibly, in grave danger.
What do you have?

19:02.100 --> 19:05.645
Okay, so, the prints were smeared,
but techs were able to lift two partials.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.565
And they're a match for an escaped
convict's brother, Jim Clemons.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.983
And the blood?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.777
It's a DNA match for Tyler Clemons,
convicted murderer.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.362
So, what now?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.072
Now? We don't stop 'til we find them.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.574
I got a BOLO out,
and an investigative alert.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.535
I have officers across the city
sitting on their known associates,

19:20.618 --> 19:22.203
and their family members.
So far, no hits.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.039
Meantime, no one else can know about this.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.876
If the news catches wind
of the kidnapping,

19:27.959 --> 19:29.836
the abductors might
try to cut their losses...

19:29.919 --> 19:32.130
Understood. But please, keep us posted?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.214
Will do.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.008
Yeah.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.471
I'm going to run Tyler and Jim Clemons
through our system,

19:40.555 --> 19:42.682
see if any medical records come up.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.229
What do you mean
Krista didn't have a seizure?

19:48.313 --> 19:49.856
I saw it with my own eyes.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.649
So, the involuntary movements you saw

19:51.733 --> 19:53.651
were caused by something
called dyskinesia.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.695
Is that due to her schizophrenia?

19:55.778 --> 19:56.821
No.

19:56.905 --> 20:00.199
It can be caused by an adverse
drug interaction.

20:00.283 --> 20:04.162
In this case, between the drug
we gave Krista for her nausea,

20:04.245 --> 20:07.665
metoclopramide, and her antipsychotic
medication, risperidone.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.335
But here's the thing,

20:10.418 --> 20:13.838
Krista told us that
she had stopped taking her risperidone,

20:14.422 --> 20:18.092
and yet, the labs showed
a low level of the drug in her system.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.428
Do you have any idea why that might be?

20:20.511 --> 20:21.930
I don't know. What does it matter?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.598
At least, she's taking her medicine again.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.850
I think we can all agree that that's
a good thing. Right?

20:25.934 --> 20:28.144
So, based on the half-life of risperidone,

20:28.227 --> 20:31.814
we know that Krista
hasn't taken the drug in roughly 48 hours.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.026
The amount of time she's been crashing
at her boyfriend's,

20:35.860 --> 20:36.903
away from home.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.281
Joanne, have you been giving Krista
risperidone without her knowledge?

20:42.325 --> 20:44.327
She had been doing so well, I just...

20:47.705 --> 20:50.375
When she told me she was stopping,
I had to do something.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.836
Dr. Charles, please,

20:53.920 --> 20:56.547
you remember her hallucinations,
how bad it got.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.342
You can't say anything.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.969
I'm only trying to protect her.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.845
I am begging you. Please.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.806
Joanne, dosing her without her knowledge

21:04.889 --> 21:07.266
it's just, it's extraordinarily
dangerous.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.811
It's also a direct violation
of her autonomy.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.523
Now the best thing would be
for you to tell her,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.858
but if you're not up for that,

21:15.942 --> 21:18.444
I'm sorry, but it is my duty
to let her know.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.907
Please don't.

I gotta deal with these bleeders
individually.

Come on.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.497
Jasmine did great.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.083
The transplant couldn't have
gone any better.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.209
Thank you.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.129
She's really lucky
to have a friend like you.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.384
Will you excuse me?

22:23.468 --> 22:25.845
I should probably go tell
the boys the good news.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.472
Yeah, of course.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.848
Lauren! Hey!

22:30.600 --> 22:32.643
Hey, April. Was that Lauren Knight?

22:32.727 --> 22:33.728
Do you know her?

22:33.811 --> 22:36.397
Yeah. From when I worked
at Children and Family Services.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.733
Wait. Lauren used to work at DCFS?

22:38.816 --> 22:40.109
Mmm-hmm.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.402
Do you know if she still works there?

22:41.486 --> 22:43.696
Pretty sure, yeah. Why?

22:43.780 --> 22:46.199
No, I just thought she said
she worked at a bank.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.827
Doesn't DCFS keep adoption records?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.537
Mmm-hmm.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.248
Excuse me, Arlene. I need to make a call.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.001
Thank you so much for calling.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.504
Okay.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.591
-Sharon!
-SHARON: Yeah.

23:04.175 --> 23:07.512
A clerk from a local gas station
in the West Loop just called,

23:07.595 --> 23:08.930
said he found Natalie's badge.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.349
Please tell me he laid eyes on her?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.017
He did. She was okay.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.353
Okay, I'll call Detective Halstead,

23:15.436 --> 23:17.855
hopefully, they'll have
security cameras there.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.816
-Yeah. Oh, Sharon.
-Yeah?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.400
Where are we with the medical records?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.069
I'm still working on it.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.237
Okay.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.908
How's my mom?
Any side effects from the anesthesia?

23:29.700 --> 23:34.664
None. She started asking about you
the moment she woke up. Sweet lady.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.500
Yeah, she is.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.462
Jasmine, how could you? Both of you?

23:41.546 --> 23:42.630
April, what are you talking about?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.382
They conned Annette.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.635
She posed as her daughter.
They catfished her for an organ.

23:47.718 --> 23:48.803
That's not true.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.806
Jasmine, yeah, you were adopted,

23:51.889 --> 23:53.641
your biological parents

23:53.724 --> 23:56.978
are Derrick and Janine, both deceased.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.647
You accessed adoption records
to set up Annette?

23:59.730 --> 24:01.440
Of course not. That's ridiculous.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.067
APRIL: Jasmine?

24:03.151 --> 24:04.443
Say something!

24:04.527 --> 24:06.571
Jasmine, don't answer him.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.240
Annette put her life on the line for you!

24:09.949 --> 24:13.035
I know. I know she did.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.538
And I didn't set out
to hurt her, I promise.

24:18.332 --> 24:22.044
It's just, when I found out
that my biological parents were dead,

24:23.504 --> 24:25.256
I had no other option.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.758

24:28.843 --> 24:31.929
I couldn't leave my boys, I couldn't.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.975
What you did is illegal.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.561
Annette could press charges.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.980
APRIL: What was the plan?

24:41.731 --> 24:43.983
Were you gonna ditch her
while she's recovering?

24:44.066 --> 24:46.068
God, no.
(GROANS)

24:46.861 --> 24:47.904
Never.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.699
Annette may not be my biological mom,

24:51.782 --> 24:54.243
but she's become family
to me and the boys.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.538
We love her. We'd never abandon her.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.582
This isn't Jasmine's fault.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.168
Listen, this whole thing was my idea.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.669
Okay, please.

We can't unseal medical records.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.029

27:35.112 --> 27:39.158
Bobby was treated for stage four
brain cancer at East Mercy.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.410
He's terminal.
His grandmother signed him out,

27:41.994 --> 27:43.913
took him home for hospice.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.456

I was hoping you were
Jasmine and my grandbabies.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.356
Annette, that's what we came
to talk to you about.

28:10.940 --> 28:14.193
I'm so sorry, but we have to tell you,

28:14.276 --> 28:17.154
Jasmine is not actually your daughter.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.995
-I already knew.
-What?

28:25.079 --> 28:27.164
My daughter, Zora,

28:28.249 --> 28:30.918
died 12 years ago, in a shelter.

28:31.669 --> 28:34.088
At least, that's what the folks
in the neighborhood tell me.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.466

why didn't you say something?

28:45.850 --> 28:49.728
I made some bad choices
trying to provide for my little girl,

28:49.812 --> 28:51.981
and I ended up doing time.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.858
That's how I lost her.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.070
But I never stopped thinking about her.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.046
To make it up to Zora, somehow.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.966
So, I played along.

29:20.468 --> 29:24.096
I didn't tell Jasmine that someone must've
made a clerical error,

29:24.180 --> 29:26.807
and I wasn't really her mother.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.687
Annette, it wasn't a clerical error.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.900
Jasmine knew you were not her mother.
She conned you.

29:49.747 --> 29:50.831
I don't care.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.668
Miss Hill, what they did was wrong.

For the first time in my life,

29:59.465 --> 30:01.550
I have a family.

30:03.010 --> 30:06.138

or those boys.

If you'd just let me continue

to seek a court order

You should not have to suffer like this.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.783
(WHIMPERS)

37:23.367 --> 37:24.451
First, you snitch on me.

37:24.534 --> 37:28.205
Then, you come in here,
and you jeopardize my recovery.

37:30.123 --> 37:33.210
They catch me,
I will never be able to practice again.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.420
-Hannah, I was just trying to...
-Go.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.923
Go and don't come back again.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.885
Go! Go! Go!

37:41.969 --> 37:46.181
Get out! Get out! Get out, now!

37:46.264 --> 37:47.641
Hannah, is everything okay?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.192
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

38:02.197 --> 38:03.490
Ben. Now, look here.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.033
I know you're used to running things
in the hospital,

38:05.117 --> 38:06.827
but I am my own man.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.705
You do not make decisions for me, okay?

38:12.374 --> 38:14.251
You still waiting for your results?

38:14.751 --> 38:17.671
I'm sorry, babe. I just can't.

38:18.714 --> 38:23.301
What if it's bad news?
What if the hormone therapy isn't working?

38:23.385 --> 38:25.262
Then we'll figure something else out.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.390
I'm gonna be with you
every step of the way.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.684
I know you will.
And that's what scares me.

38:30.767 --> 38:31.852
What's that mean?

38:31.935 --> 38:33.353
-Ben, no!
-Maggie!

38:34.021 --> 38:35.814
You were by my side at my lowest.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.817
And now, you're in remission.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.778
You should be out there, having fun.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.448
Not stuck in the hospital with me.

38:44.531 --> 38:47.534
And there you go again.
Telling me what to do.

38:48.243 --> 38:52.247
You don't get it, do you?
You are my life.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.960
Sorry to interrupt.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.048
I come bearing very good news.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.591
What?

39:03.175 --> 39:05.177
-Do you want to step into my office?
-No.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.804
Please, tell me now.

39:07.888 --> 39:11.141
The radiologist read your scans.
No sign of a mass.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.519
And your blood work,
it was remarkable, really.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.271
No detectable tumor markers.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.565
So, does that mean...

39:20.317 --> 39:22.194
You're officially in remission.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.574

39:28.909 --> 39:30.035
(CHUCKLES)

(SOBBING)

39:35.332 --> 39:37.167
After inseminating the eggs,

39:37.250 --> 39:40.128
unfortunately, we found
that none of them fertilized.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.172
I know this is not the news you wanted,

39:42.255 --> 39:44.299
but it doesn't have to be
the end of the road.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.761
You can start another cycle
in as little as six weeks.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.478
-We'll talk about it, and let you know.
-No. I'll do it.

40:05.195 --> 40:08.406
All right. So, what do you wanna
do to celebrate?

40:08.490 --> 40:11.493
Spa treatment? Dinner?
You name it, I got you.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.663
Just being with you, that's enough.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.457
Oh, come on! Come on, come on, come on.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.709
Weren't you just lecturing me about
having fun?

40:19.793 --> 40:20.794
Yeah!

40:20.877 --> 40:22.546
Go big or go home.

40:22.629 --> 40:26.967
If you had one wish right now,
anything in the world, what would it be?

40:27.050 --> 40:28.760
Honestly?

40:28.844 --> 40:30.220
Mmm-hmm.

40:34.975 --> 40:40.480
If... The only thing I would wish is...

40:43.191 --> 40:45.193
To spend the rest of my life with you.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.281
Are you serious?

40:51.700 --> 40:54.494
You better not be playing with me,
because I'd marry you tomorrow.

40:54.578 --> 40:55.745
I'm not playing.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.290
Oh, baby.
