01:03.439 --> 01:04.897
Are we shooting?

01:05.149 --> 01:06.316
What?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.860
Are we shooting people or what?

01:09.111 --> 01:10.362
Are we shooting?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.697
That's what I'm asking you!

01:12.865 --> 01:14.699
What's the answer?

01:14.951 --> 01:18.828
I don't know the answer!
That's what I'm trying to find out!

01:19.080 --> 01:21.665
- Give me some gum.
- I already gave you some.

01:22.124 --> 01:26.294
I can see a grain of sand in there.
I just can't get it out.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.838
I think this guy has a weapon!

01:32.969 --> 01:34.344
Yeah, he does!

01:50.111 --> 01:54.155
Whoa! Congratulations,
my man, you shot yourself a raghead.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.368
Dag. Didn't think I'd get to see
anybody shot in this war.

01:58.703 --> 01:59.911
Aw, take my picture.

02:07.211 --> 02:10.964
I just want to celebrate another day of livin'

02:11.257 --> 02:16.803
I just want to celebrate another day of life

02:16.971 --> 02:21.641
I put my faith in the people
But the people let me down

02:21.809 --> 02:26.438
So I turned the other way
And I carry on anyhow

02:26.605 --> 02:29.065
That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate

02:30.568 --> 02:31.735
Another day of livin'

02:33.529 --> 02:35.363
I just want to celebrate

02:35.531 --> 02:37.907
Spirits are high,
and the music is boisterous...

02:38.075 --> 02:40.785
...as these young troops...
Shit, hold on a second. Okay.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.539
Music is high, and the spirits
are soaring as these...

02:44.707 --> 02:46.833
Did I just say "soaring"?
How did it sound?

02:47.126 --> 02:50.920
They say you exorcised the ghost of
Vietnam with a clear, moral imperative.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.130
We liberated Kuwait.

02:54.216 --> 02:58.511
If I had to start again
With just my children and my wife

02:58.804 --> 03:02.640
I would thank my lucky stars
To be living here today

03:03.517 --> 03:06.019
Because the flag
Still stands for freedom

03:06.270 --> 03:09.439
And they can't take that away

03:09.648 --> 03:12.734
And I'd gladly stand up next to you

03:12.985 --> 03:15.612
And defend her still today

03:15.863 --> 03:21.326
'Cause there ain't no doubt
I love this land

03:21.494 --> 03:25.455
God bless the U.S.A.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.250
It was you that chose your due

03:29.418 --> 03:31.294
You built a maze you can't get through

03:31.462 --> 03:35.298
I tried to help you all I can
But I can't do nothing for you, man

03:35.466 --> 03:37.759
I can't do nothing for you, man

03:43.474 --> 03:45.433
I can't do nothing for you, man

03:45.601 --> 03:47.477
- Go lean on shells
- Answer man

03:47.645 --> 03:49.104
I can't do nothing for you, man

03:51.649 --> 03:53.650
- Go lean on shells
- Answer man

03:53.818 --> 03:57.612
I can't do nothing for you, man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

03:57.780 --> 04:01.658
Make you love the wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night

04:01.826 --> 04:05.745
The cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls

04:05.913 --> 04:08.456
Oozy down the bullets in the gun

04:08.624 --> 04:10.667
Trained warrior! Trained warrior!

04:10.835 --> 04:12.669
Trained warrior! Oh, my God!

04:12.837 --> 04:16.255
Major Gates, Major Gates, Major Gates!

04:27.435 --> 04:29.102
What's Adriana got?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.312
Just the celebration story.

04:31.564 --> 04:34.274
That's it? That story's evaporating.

04:34.567 --> 04:37.569
The Iraqi POW story's evaporating.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.364
I still have my gold story, though.
Returning the gold to Kuwait.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.032
What do you know about that?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.326
They think it's in
some bunker somewhere.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.164
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:49.415 --> 04:52.250
- What's going on?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

04:52.418 --> 04:56.504
You said he was former Delta, he'd take
great care of me. What a bunch of bullshit.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.923
- Let me handle this.
- Doesn't she have an escort?

04:59.091 --> 05:02.760
- Of course she does. She's right here.
- Find her someone she can fuck...

05:02.970 --> 05:05.597
- ...so she'll leave my escort alone.
- That's unnecessary.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.309
I don't want him going to other
reporters and giving away my stories.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.353
- You don't have any stories.
- You don't tell people that!

05:12.521 --> 05:14.397
Look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.567
Yes, look at me.
I've got my clothes on! I'm dressed!

05:20.863 --> 05:22.697
But I will say you are old, Adriana.

05:22.948 --> 05:26.242
I really don't need this shit, major.
You understand me?

05:26.410 --> 05:28.745
- Yeah.
- This is a media war. A media war...

05:28.913 --> 05:30.330
...and you better get on board!

05:30.498 --> 05:33.291
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
I'm gonna straight you out!

05:33.584 --> 05:35.210
Take a picture!

05:35.377 --> 05:36.419
One more!

05:41.300 --> 05:42.926
- Very handsome.
- All right.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.969
So please stay off my back

05:45.137 --> 05:47.514
Or I will attack
And you don't want that

05:47.765 --> 05:49.641
- Yeah!
- Good shot, Barlow.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.434
Hey, enough!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.444
Captain's coming!

06:07.785 --> 06:10.703
You better move your butts.
He's coming right now.

06:10.955 --> 06:14.958
Goddamn it! Where the hell did this
booze come from? Hey, get rid of it!

06:15.209 --> 06:19.379
We gotta take more Iraqi prisoners
tomorrow! Tomorrow!

06:19.672 --> 06:21.548
Remove the magazine from your weapon.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.841
Sling your weapon over
your left shoulder, muzzle down.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.637
Have both arms raised above your head.

06:27.930 --> 06:31.140
Approach the multinational force's
position slowly...

06:31.350 --> 06:34.060
...with the lead soldier
holding this document...

06:34.311 --> 06:37.772
...above his head. if you do this,
you will not die.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.860
You will be processed
as prisoners of war...

06:43.153 --> 06:45.405
...provided food, shelter and clothing...

06:45.573 --> 06:49.659
...and be treated according to the guidelines
provided by the Geneva Convention.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.078
Do not resist.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.664
If you do this, you get this.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.876
If you surrender,
you will get food and shelter. Okay?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.921
Everything is cool.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Just relax.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.841
Sir, you're gonna have to
take the turban off as well.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.552
Did you rape and torture anyone
in Kuwait, Abdul?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.220
What about you, motherfucker?

07:09.430 --> 07:13.516
Hey, hey. You're making them hysterical.
Stop pointing that. You'll get us in trouble.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.518
Just relax. We want everybody facedown.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.021
- Come on.
- Get down.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.190
Take these things... Hey,
no comprende English, motherfucker?

07:21.358 --> 07:23.318
What is your fucking problem?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.695
Act in a more
professional manner, please.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.656
I wanna be professional.
He wouldn't take his rags off.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.117
Pay attention to how it's done.
Excuse me, sir.

07:31.702 --> 07:35.830
Listen. Sir, we're gonna need you to
disrobe like all the other towelheads, okay?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.712
I hate to see it come to this.
Strip him down.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.589
Come on, motherfucker.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.217
Take your fucking clothes off.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.427
Come on.

07:50.888 --> 07:56.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Troy. Troy.
Troy, come here. Check this out.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.102
Freaky thing here, possibly.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.855
There's a document in that guy's ass.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.732
We got a classified situation.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.734
You think he ate it?

08:04.902 --> 08:07.487
No, it wouldn't come out
perfect like that if he ate it.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.198
- Pull it out, private.
- Back off! Back off!

08:10.366 --> 08:11.407
Pull it out.

08:11.575 --> 08:15.161
Man, I didn't join the Army
to pull paper out of people's asses.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.497
No, sir. Not what I signed up for.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.253
Aw... Aw...

08:24.421 --> 08:25.922
Ugh!

08:26.799 --> 08:28.299
Open it up.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.051
You only gave me one glove.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.428
Sorry, I only have one,
but you have to open it.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.972
That's how the chain of command works.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.229
Ugh.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.440
What is it?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.276
It's important enough
to squeeze your cheeks for.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.407
You're supposed to make her
feel good about stories we want...

08:52.574 --> 08:54.158
...not push stories we don't want.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.328
You don't walk away from her
and go screw another journalist.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.414
I never wanted this job, Ron.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.083
Your work in Iraq was over. Done.

09:02.251 --> 09:05.086
I'm trying to help you out.
If you play your cards right...

09:05.379 --> 09:07.797
...maybe she'll hook you up
with the media at home.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.966
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that?

09:10.134 --> 09:11.175
Where you going?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.010
You got your star clinched.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.305
Oh, so now it's my fault that
you plateaued a long time ago?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.891
- I don't even know what we did here.
- Don't start.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.227
Just tell me what we did here, Ron.

09:21.437 --> 09:24.021
You wanna occupy Iraq
and do Vietnam all over again?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.815
Is that your brilliant idea?

09:26.024 --> 09:29.444
- Fuck it, I'm retiring anyway.
- Until you do, you're an Army officer.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.572
You're still taking care of
that reporter, so do it right.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.951
Let's move this now!

09:53.385 --> 09:55.845
Come on, you've washed your hands
a thousand times.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.639
Lord knows what vermin
live in the butt of a dune coon.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.184
Why do you let this cracker
follow you around, man?

10:01.351 --> 10:04.020
He's got no high school.
He's from a group home in Dallas.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.105
- He doesn't know better.
- Don't say that.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.024
I don't care if he's from Johannesburg.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.778
I don't wanna hear "dune coon" or
"sand nigger" from him or anybody.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.738
Captain uses those terms.

10:14.156 --> 10:17.867
Look, the point is, "towelhead" and
"camel jockey" are good substitutes.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.577
- Exactly.
- I apologize.

10:19.787 --> 10:24.123
A little confusing with all this pro-Saudi,
anti-Iraqi type language and all that.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.375
Did you get the aerials?

10:28.212 --> 10:29.378
How'd you get those?

10:29.546 --> 10:31.964
- Chief is hooked up.
- Hey. Keep Walter on that door.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.133
Would you take
those fucking things off?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
I never got to use night vision.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.137
They do not work during the day.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.680
Yeah, they kind of work.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.934
Just stand outside so Chief
can translate my Iraqi ass map, okay?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.685
Okay.

10:47.523 --> 10:50.024
Are you ready to work with me now?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.152
I'm ready to work with you.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.571
Good. Because I've got an amazing lead.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.032
- It was in his ass.
- That's not the real story.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.576
- What's the real story?
- it was in the guy's dick.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.622
- Had to pull it out with a pair of tweezers.
- A 10-page atlas of Saddam's bunkers?

11:04.790 --> 11:08.835
Yeah. Only real small, like those books
you get in a box of Cracker Jacks.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.421
They pull it out the guy ear.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.465
- What?
- "Out of his ear."

11:14.633 --> 11:15.675
Maybe out the nose.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.593
- What's he talking about?
- "The nose."

11:17.761 --> 11:19.554
- What body part?
- Let me handle this.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.599
- It was stitched in back of his head.
- Stitched in the back of his head.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.059
- The guy's name?
- What guy?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.519
The guy who found it.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.145
- I cannot tell you.
- Fuck that!

11:28.313 --> 11:30.022
- You said you could.
- Sorry, not now.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.859
- This guy doesn't know shit.
- Adriana, come here.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.068
He doesn't know shit.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.197
Listen to me. This guy is French
Special Forces and he can help us.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.907
- He can?
- Yes, and he's my friend.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.493
But he's not gonna talk to me
if you're around.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.537
- Better not be fucking with me.
- I'm not.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.666
- I want the story this time.
- You'll get the story. Okay?

11:49.167 --> 11:52.336
These have got to be Saddam's
bunkers between Karbala and Nazaria.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.546
What's inside?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.799
According to Intel,
Picasso, Sony, Armani, Rolex.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.261
Kuwait was like the Arab Beverly Hills.
Saddam jacked them for it.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.763
Be nice to bring something home
besides sand fleas.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.017
One gold Rolex would get me a very
nice house outside of Garland.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.185
Five would get a Lexus convertible.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.646
- Lexus doesn't make one.
- Yes, they do.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.148
It has room for a kid seat.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.567
- Infiniti has a convertible, not Lexus.
- Wrong.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.613
Either way, the Lord put this map in
our path. I believe we'll find something.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.324
He could also put a land mine
in our path.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.660
I don't think so. I've been fire
baptized, and this feels safe.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.120
What are you talking about?

12:26.330 --> 12:29.123
I have a ring of Jesus fire
to guide my decisions.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.585
- You're putting me on, right?
- Do I look like I'm putting you on?

12:32.836 --> 12:34.420
Okay, ring of Jesus fire.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.963
Halt!

12:36.131 --> 12:37.673
Freeze, motherfucker!

12:38.675 --> 12:41.552
- Sir, this tent is restricted, sir.
- Get out of my way.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.929
Sir! Sir!

12:43.138 --> 12:46.182
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Goddamn it.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.603
Good afternoon.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.940
Would this be the proctology tent?

12:54.191 --> 12:55.524
No, sir.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.402
Maybe it's a urology tent.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.281
Or the neurology tent.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.700
Or the ear, nose and throat tent.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.119
Captain's at a staff meeting, sir.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.704
Captain a proctologist?

13:08.956 --> 13:12.249
- What's a proctologist, sir?
- it doesn't matter.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.586
I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for Barlow.

13:23.762 --> 13:28.015
You're on the path to truth when you smell
shit. Isn't that what they say, sergeant?

13:29.059 --> 13:31.852
I don't recognize you, sir.
Are you in this division?

13:32.104 --> 13:34.855
He's not from this division.
He's Special Forces.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.733
Have you soldiers
presented this map to your captain?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.360
Not yet, sir.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.071
I'll take it to him.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.241
That's not necessary, sir.
He's my CO. I can take it to him.

13:45.701 --> 13:46.951
Don't get grabby, sergeant.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.453
He's our CO, sir.
I'd have to tell him you took it.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.084
That won't do either of us any good,
will it?

13:56.753 --> 13:58.504
No, sir.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.551
Sit down.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.099
- What do you see here?
- Bunkers, sir.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.768
- What are in them?
- Stuff they stole from Kuwait.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.605
Bullshit. I'm talking about
millions in Kuwaiti bullions.

14:16.815 --> 14:20.067
You mean them little cubes
you put in hot water and make soup?

14:20.235 --> 14:23.070
No, not the little cubes
you put in hot water to make soup.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.572
Gold bricks, Conrad.

14:24.740 --> 14:28.951
Saddam stole it from the sheiks.
I have no problem stealing it from Saddam.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.496
My guess is, he's divided these bricks
into several different stashes.

14:32.748 --> 14:37.126
Just one of these stashes would be easy
for us to take from his deserting army.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.795
That would be enough
to get us out of our day jobs.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.548
Unless of course you reservists
are in love with your day jobs.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.940
I don't really have a day job, sir.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.234
First thing we have to do...

15:02.527 --> 15:05.654
...is make sure this is more
than a love letter to an Iraqi.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.157
It's a series of bunkers
outside Karbala, sir.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.493
- Maybe.
- Definitely, sir.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.369
The recon photos match.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.996
We'll see.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.123
Dag.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.335
It's what makes S.F. so badass.
We got the best flashlights.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.670
Still looks like a series of bunkers.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.840
Three villages a little farther
to the east.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.676
- Seventy-five clicks north.
- More like 65.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.512
Way north of any allied troops.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.014
Perfect. We don't want
any troops around.

15:32.182 --> 15:35.184
Yeah. Just us and a Humvee
up by the Euphrates River Valley.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.311
Where they put Moses in the basket.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.646
That's Egypt.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.567
We three kings be stealing the gold

15:43.819 --> 15:44.819
Quiet down!

15:44.986 --> 15:47.196
My friends all drive Porsches
I must make amends

15:47.364 --> 15:50.199
- Hey, just shut up, okay?
- Are you done singing?

15:50.867 --> 15:51.909
What about mines, sir?

15:52.077 --> 15:54.787
Grid was swept by the 82nd.
We'll stick to the roads.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.747
Are we gonna need
a deuce-and-a-half?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.626
- No, it's easier to slip out in a Humvee.
- What if we have a lot to carry?

16:00.836 --> 16:03.504
We'll grab an Iraqi truck.
Better cover if we get stopped.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.215
- We could always say we captured it.
- That's right.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.135
We leave at dawn, back before lunch.
No big deal.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.428
- What's the guy's name outside?
- Walter.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.890
- Bolo! Get in here!
- Who's Bolo, sir?

16:15.100 --> 16:17.059
Bolo is a guy who
doesn't know what he's doing.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.270
- Yes, sir?
- Want you to get this reporter...

16:19.437 --> 16:21.355
...off my back.
Know who Adriana Cruz is?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.399
- Reporter on NBS, sir.
- That's right.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.902
Tell her I'm checking a story
and you're bringing her to meet me.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.654
- In Iraq?
- No.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.365
I'll give you a fake copy of this map.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.659
Take her on a ride
that lasts all morning...

16:33.910 --> 16:36.662
...and goes nowhere near
the villages outside of Karbala.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.916
When you don't find me, it'll be
because you got lost. Is that clear?

16:41.126 --> 16:43.210
- Yes, sir.
- Any other questions?

16:43.378 --> 16:46.589
Yeah. Is it true that to be S.F.,
you gotta cut off an enemy's ear?

16:46.882 --> 16:50.092
- Are you able to control him?
- Yes, sir. He'll be fine, I promise.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.928
Let's get ready to roll in the morning.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.353
All right, here we go, ma'am.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.531
Pull!

17:15.535 --> 17:16.618
Pull!

17:20.790 --> 17:22.415
Pull!

17:23.335 --> 17:24.960
Let me get some, chief.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.755
Pull!

17:30.091 --> 17:31.300
Pull!

17:32.052 --> 17:34.386
- I gave you a better arc!
- What you talking about?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.096
I threw the ball at a higher arc.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.681
- Made it easier.
- Bullshit!

17:37.849 --> 17:39.975
Blacks make better receivers
than quarterbacks.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.227
Stop speaking.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.646
Warren Moon is one of
the best in the league.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.357
Houston's gone nowhere
with Warren Moon.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.984
- Randall Cunningham?
- Don't get in the mud with him.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.820
Eagles'll never make it to
the Super Bowl with Cunningham.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.032
Doug Williams not only took
the Redskins to the Super Bowl...

17:55.200 --> 17:56.992
- ...but they won.
- Yeah, so?

17:57.160 --> 18:00.329
We can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.830
Let's see what you can hit.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.626
Come on, sorry-ass cracker!
You'll never hit no Iraqi!

18:05.835 --> 18:08.212
I'll hit that Iraqi.
I'll blow his fucking head off!

18:08.421 --> 18:11.048
Chief, he talks like that,
ignore him or it'll get worse.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.009
You're right, you're right.
Just can't help myself sometimes.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.344
Watch this.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.847
Whoa! Unh!

18:23.436 --> 18:26.689
- What was that?
- I rigged a football with C4, sir.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.023
Why would you do that?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.943
You said we could fire off
some rounds when we left camp.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.445
I said that you could fire a few rounds.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.531
We didn't get to see any action, sir.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.702
- You wanna see some action?
- Yeah, I do, sir.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.215
Is this what you're after?

18:55.427 --> 18:57.011
We dropped a lot of bombs here.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.472
We also buried a lot of guys alive.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.643
The only action we seen was on CNN,
except for that dude Troy shot.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.187
- Shot him in the neck?
- That's right, sir.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.399
Fucking badass. I was there.
Fucking took him out at 400 yards.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.360
Head popped up 3 feet in the air.
It was a crazy shot, man.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.529
You know anything
about gunshot wounds?

19:15.697 --> 19:17.156
- I don't know.
- Specifically.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.784
The worst thing about a gunshot wound,
provided you survive the bullet...

19:21.036 --> 19:23.579
- ...is something called sepsis.
- infection of the blood.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.247
Right. Say a bullet tears into you...

19:26.583 --> 19:29.418
Creates a cavity of dead tissue.
That cavity...

19:29.627 --> 19:33.464
...it fills up with bile and bacteria.
You're fucked.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.804
But we're gonna do this
without firing any shots...

19:41.056 --> 19:44.266
...and just to be sure,
we're gonna do a dry run.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.143
So get your suits on.

19:46.436 --> 19:50.689
We will say that the cow is
a primary guard outside the bunker.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.442
Pull up fast. Stop short.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.778
Move very aggressively. Got it?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.112
Got it!

19:57.614 --> 19:59.031
Go!

20:20.470 --> 20:21.470
Who's hurt?

20:22.097 --> 20:23.764
It's all cow.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.142
Yeah, it's all cow.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.395
Kaboom!

20:29.562 --> 20:31.688
Y'all see that cow's head shoot up?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.066
Just like a cartoon.
It's fucking crazy.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.068
You said this area was swept for mines.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.405
Wasn't a mine. It was a cluster bomb.
Very hard to see.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.658
Get in the Humvee.
We're moving on.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.327
Round, round, get around
I get around

20:45.495 --> 20:48.038
Yeah, get around
Ooh, ooh, I get around

20:50.875 --> 20:52.334
Round, round, get around

20:52.502 --> 20:53.836
- I get around
- I get around, yeah

20:54.003 --> 20:55.587
Get around

20:55.755 --> 20:56.797
I get around

20:56.965 --> 20:58.757
- I get around
- Get around, round, round

20:58.925 --> 21:00.426
- I get around
- From town to town

21:00.593 --> 21:02.428
We go in fast, leave the safeties on.

21:02.637 --> 21:05.389
Hit them with the blinding power
of American sunshine.

21:05.557 --> 21:09.351
- I'm making real good bread
- Get around, round, round, I get around

21:09.519 --> 21:11.645
I'm gettin' bugged
Driving up and down the same old strip

21:13.440 --> 21:16.024
I gotta find a new place
Where the kids are hip

21:19.737 --> 21:22.573
My buddies and me
Are gettin' real well-known

21:22.740 --> 21:25.868
Yeah, the bad guys know us
And they leave us alone

21:26.035 --> 21:27.077
I get around

21:27.245 --> 21:28.620
Where's the bunker?

21:28.913 --> 21:30.706
There. No, there!

21:30.874 --> 21:31.915
Round, round, I get around

21:32.083 --> 21:34.918
- I'm a real cool head
- Get around, round, round, I get around

21:35.086 --> 21:36.545
I'm making real good bread

21:36.713 --> 21:40.090
Orders from the president
of the United States of America.

21:40.341 --> 21:44.052
Orders from the president
of the United States of America.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.554
- Step aside.
- Get back!

21:45.889 --> 21:47.347
On the ground, right now.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.560
We are the Army
of the United States of America.

21:51.853 --> 21:52.895
Stay back!

21:53.062 --> 21:56.690
We are the Army
of the United States of America.

21:56.858 --> 22:00.068
No milk! Baby milk!

22:00.403 --> 22:02.488
- Baby milk!
- Let's go.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.157
We are here for
your protection and safety.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.910
Stay calm. Lay back. Hey.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.204
Let's go, step aside. Move!

22:10.997 --> 22:14.500
Orders from President Bush.
Part of the ceasefire agreement.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.173
Clear. Let's move.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.844
- United States military!
- United States military!

22:26.012 --> 22:27.346
Everybody out!

22:27.597 --> 22:30.682
We are here for your protection
and safety, all right?

22:32.393 --> 22:35.771
Hey. Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.200
Order from the United States.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.210
Ah. Shit!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.132
Again!

23:06.427 --> 23:08.804
- Freeze!
- I love the United State of freedom.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.973
- I hate Saddam.
- Yah! Yah!

23:11.182 --> 23:13.141
- Yah! Yah! Yah!
- Let him go!

23:15.395 --> 23:17.771
No problem, my friend. No problem.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.064
No problem.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.149
Tell him to shut up. Be quiet.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.151
I am love United State of freedom.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.487
I'm love United States of freedom too.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.865
- Just calm down and be quiet, okay?
- I am friend. Friend.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.742
I am... I am friend. I am friend.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.703
- You look for chemical weapon?
- No.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.038
- We look for the gold.
- No gold here.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.708
No gold.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.334
- What did you say?
- No gold.

23:39.502 --> 23:42.671
- He says there's no gold here.
- Where's the gold?

23:44.173 --> 23:45.966
- Kill him.
- You wanna die?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.552
- Other bunker, other village! Yes.
- Other bunker?

23:48.803 --> 23:51.179
- Not this bunker? Another?
- No. Not this town.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.347
That town? That town?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.891
That town! Yes, yes, yes! That town.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.645
Let's go.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.822
Why you throwing rocks at them?

25:07.256 --> 25:08.757
It's milk.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.018
Please bring us food.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.647
- Please bring medicine.
- Medicine. Medicine.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.608
- Please help us.
- Hey, hey. Hey, come on.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.152
- We need doctors.
- Off the vehicle!

25:29.946 --> 25:32.322
Ma'am, you'll have to step down
from the vehicle.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.616
Hospital! Hospital!

25:34.784 --> 25:36.034
We need your help, please.

25:36.494 --> 25:37.911
Food. Food.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.122
Give them the M.R.E.s. Let's go!

25:43.626 --> 25:44.793
Take that. Take that.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.548
The soldier's taking the water
away from that woman.

25:49.966 --> 25:50.966
Heads up!

25:52.510 --> 25:54.094
Here you go.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.304
Look out! Get off!

25:56.681 --> 25:58.014
Hey.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.434
Hey, give that back to the boy!

26:06.232 --> 26:09.693
- Take me, take me, take me.
- Excuse me. No.

26:09.944 --> 26:12.654
- You can't come with us.
- Please take me. Aah!

26:28.004 --> 26:30.172
Right here, right now.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.260
The fuck was going on back there, major?

26:35.511 --> 26:38.638
Civilians spitting on soldiers.
Soldiers shooting civilians.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.515
Ignoring us like we weren't there.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.976
They surrendered.
Now they're after civilians.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.853
Why'd they blow up that milk truck?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.773
- Trying to starve the people out.
- Why?

26:48.024 --> 26:50.859
Bush told the people
to rise up against Saddam.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.195
They thought they had our support,
they don't.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.363
Now they're getting slaughtered.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.371
So where's the next bunker?

27:03.748 --> 27:06.875
About 20 clicks on the map,
according to what that guy said.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.753
No, it's not.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.340
There was something about that well.

27:13.508 --> 27:16.051
- What well?
- The well in the center of town.

27:16.302 --> 27:20.013
There were soldiers guarding it.
I bet there's a bunker in there.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.057
The guy lied to us.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.643
It's back where we came from.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.400
Hey, I don't know if I can do this, okay?

27:32.902 --> 27:34.736
Hey! I got a family.

27:34.946 --> 27:38.448
If I shit in a bag for life because
I got shot after the war was over...

27:38.699 --> 27:40.742
...that'd be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

27:41.118 --> 27:43.495
What is the most important
thing in life?

27:43.746 --> 27:45.497
What are you talking about?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.500
What's the most important thing?

27:48.668 --> 27:50.836
- Respect.
- Too dependent on other people.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.547
- What, love?
- A little Disneyland, isn't it?

27:54.298 --> 27:55.423
God's will.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.260
- Close.
- What is it then?

27:58.511 --> 27:59.636
Necessity.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.304
As in...?

28:01.472 --> 28:05.016
People do what is most necessary
to them at any given moment.

28:05.268 --> 28:10.105
Now, what's most necessary to Saddam's
troops is to put down the uprising.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.274
We can do what we want.
They won't touch us.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.694
All right. I'll be wearing
fashionable Kevlar.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.113
Me too.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.949
Come on, Conrad.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.661
Where the hell are the bunkers?

28:24.954 --> 28:27.080
Supposed to be right around here.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.040
How about these fires?

28:29.292 --> 28:32.168
I already did this story, goddamn it.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.130
How about a rare pelican
migration out by the marshes?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.549
Fuck that! Stop the car!

28:38.009 --> 28:39.801
I don't see any bunkers. Do you?

28:40.052 --> 28:42.470
We'll find Major Gates, ma'am.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.473
Bullshit. All we're finding
is Ukrainian cranes.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.017
Pelicans.

28:47.226 --> 28:51.479
This story has been so done.
A waste of my fucking time.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.607
Look at these poor fucking birds.

28:53.858 --> 28:58.653
All covered in some kind of fucking oil,
ecological, catastrophic....

28:59.030 --> 29:00.071
Fuck it.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.453
It's so goddamn horrible!

29:09.123 --> 29:11.333
Jesus Christ!

29:16.380 --> 29:18.757
Poor fucking birds.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.717
Look at them.

29:21.552 --> 29:23.386
It's so sad.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.432
You're not gonna fuck me.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.518
I was promised the gold story,
and I'm driving.

29:30.728 --> 29:33.438
Military regulations. You cannot drive.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.607
Step away from the Chenowth, ma'am!

29:35.858 --> 29:37.359
Don't make me shoot you, ma'am!

29:41.739 --> 29:43.448
Ma'am!

29:45.618 --> 29:48.870
Ma'am! Please fucking stop!

30:00.675 --> 30:02.175
You gonna tell me where he is?

30:02.343 --> 30:04.386
- I can't tell you. I can't.
- Bullshit!

30:04.637 --> 30:06.388
- Where is he?
- I can't give you that...

30:06.639 --> 30:09.057
Come on, bitch. Tell me where he is.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.143
- I can't, ma'am.
- You'll die here like these birds!

30:12.395 --> 30:15.105
It's a village near Karbala!

30:17.650 --> 30:20.151
All right. Let's go to Karbala.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.655
Get down! Get down!

30:29.829 --> 30:32.998
- Hey, get down!
- Get down!

30:51.600 --> 30:55.395
Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul.
We're gonna have no nonsense this time.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.486
Hey! You fucking liar!

31:04.030 --> 31:05.655
Hey!

31:09.618 --> 31:10.660
Freeze!

31:10.828 --> 31:13.496
By orders of the ceasefire
signed in Safwan, March 3rd...

31:13.789 --> 31:16.124
...the United States military
hereby confiscates...

31:16.292 --> 31:19.419
...all materials stolen by Iraq
from the state of Kuwait.

31:19.587 --> 31:22.422
That means everything you took
is going back.

31:22.757 --> 31:25.508
Everybody stay calm and
we'll get through this quickly.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.053
Is that clear? Good!

31:28.262 --> 31:30.263
Now... Hey! Grab that...

31:30.431 --> 31:33.349
Hello? Hello? Hello?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.812
Keep your finger off the trigger.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.939
- Sorry about that, sir.
- No.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.649
For wife.

31:42.777 --> 31:43.777
I'm divorced.

31:44.487 --> 31:47.739
Newest and best. Newest and best.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.616
Newest and best has
better noise reduction.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.161
Less distortion. Get on the ground.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.289
This is bad music. This is bad for you.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.335
Now, I want you to tell me
where the gold is.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.420
There's another door over here.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.515
It's okay. He is prisoner. It's okay.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.368
Okay, okay. We take them outside
so we don't bother you, okay?

32:39.792 --> 32:42.877
Hey. You open that door now.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.046
Open that door.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.676
Let's go!

32:59.311 --> 33:01.896
Hey. Get down on the ground.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.566
- The prisoners stay!
- You, soldier.

33:04.733 --> 33:08.027
- Get on the ground!
- The prisoners must stay!

34:11.175 --> 34:12.257
Hey!

34:16.429 --> 34:21.141
Listen to me. Everything you stole from
Kuwait belongs to us now. You understand?

34:22.518 --> 34:23.645
I got him.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.231
- Put it back.
- Why?

34:26.440 --> 34:29.317
We stick to the plan,
plan is for the gold. We're not thieves.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.985
We're returning Kuwaiti bullion, correct?

35:09.650 --> 35:10.858
Full.

35:11.402 --> 35:12.568
Full.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.873
I'm getting a fleet of Lexus convertibles,
every color.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.376
I told you, Lexus don't
make a convertible.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.961
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.214
Okay. You're on, but it won't be
a convertible. I guarantee you.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.676
Ow. Shit! Ah.

35:36.844 --> 35:39.053
- You all right?
- Yeah. It landed on my foot.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.764
They definitely didn't get it here
in these bags.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.392
The tensilary strength in these
is only 200 pounds.

35:44.685 --> 35:46.311
- What?
- Tensilary strength.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.021
He works at an airport.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.233
If we put it in one
of these Vuitton bags...

35:52.484 --> 35:55.236
...they can hold about 65 pounds,
maybe more.

35:55.404 --> 35:56.738
You have any more luggage?

36:27.603 --> 36:30.104
United States military
is in charge here.

36:36.487 --> 36:38.488
I saw a truck out by the gas station.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.866
- What gas station?
- The one upstairs.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.285
Let's see what U-Haul has on the lot.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.918
Conrad. We need a truck.

36:52.086 --> 36:55.254
Did we get it? Did we get it?

36:55.506 --> 36:57.382
- We got it.
- Is it a lot?

36:57.633 --> 37:00.676
Conrad, you have no idea.
Are you cool here?

37:00.969 --> 37:02.470
Yeah. They've been ignoring me.

37:02.679 --> 37:05.807
Don't worry about it. Just stay calm.
I'm gonna find a truck.

37:08.102 --> 37:10.978
Move! Move away from the vehicle!

37:12.314 --> 37:13.314
Let's go!

37:51.937 --> 37:53.521
You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?

37:54.106 --> 37:56.065
We take the Kuwaiti gold, yes.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.485
- Saddam cannot keep?
- No, Saddam cannot keep.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.362
Saddam have too many problem today.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.240
- He certainly does.
- You need help to carry?

38:06.076 --> 38:07.952
I think we'll be all right.

38:13.167 --> 38:15.835
- These men help you.
- Yeah, these men help you.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.629
And then you go away fast
from all this bullshit.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.887
Keep it going, keep it going.

38:48.911 --> 38:51.954
Don't leave. Please don't leave.

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
Don't leave!

38:58.837 --> 39:00.129
Look!

39:02.216 --> 39:03.341
Help!

39:03.509 --> 39:05.801
Look! Look!

39:05.969 --> 39:07.762
Help!

39:08.180 --> 39:09.805
Please!

39:13.143 --> 39:14.727
Don't go. Don't go.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.011
You go now, please.

39:49.763 --> 39:50.972
I don't think so.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.932
This man is leader of uprising.

39:53.183 --> 39:56.185
Major, let's just stick to the plan.
The plan is for the gold.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.313
We can help these people first,
then we'll be on our way.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.857
This is not what we're here for.
Let's go!

40:08.949 --> 40:10.366
Cover me.

40:23.046 --> 40:26.549
No unnecessary shots, Conrad,
because we know what they do.

40:26.842 --> 40:29.010
They make infected pockets
full of bile, sir.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.845
That's right, that's what they do.

41:15.557 --> 41:16.974
I want you to leave this town.

41:18.518 --> 41:21.395
Saddam kill us if we leave.
Kill our family.

41:21.605 --> 41:25.900
We give you the gold.
Now U.S.A. out of Iraq.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.404
No shooting.

41:30.864 --> 41:32.740
Okay. Okay, we work something out.

41:33.784 --> 41:35.284
Easy! Take it easy!

41:41.166 --> 41:42.792
What's happening?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.335
Accident. Stay cool.

41:47.381 --> 41:48.756
No!

42:35.178 --> 42:37.263
Put your hands up.

42:37.931 --> 42:39.557
Troy!

42:54.239 --> 42:55.281
Troy?

42:57.617 --> 42:58.909
I'm okay.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.829
- Chief.
- Get down.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.378
Shut up! Get down!

43:09.880 --> 43:11.630
Get down! Shut up.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.390
- Put the people in the Humvee.
- What?

43:21.641 --> 43:23.642
Put the people in the Humvee.

43:23.894 --> 43:26.187
- There's no room.
- Make room.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.105
What happened to necessity?

43:28.565 --> 43:29.940
It just changed!

43:30.192 --> 43:32.109
Not for me. Let's go!

43:32.360 --> 43:35.279
- What if that was you?
- What if this was you without Kevlar?

43:35.447 --> 43:36.864
Hey! Hey.

43:41.870 --> 43:43.537
Great, a fucking tank.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.372
That should send us on our way.

43:47.876 --> 43:49.084
L.A.W., sir?

43:51.213 --> 43:52.588
No, let's get out of here.

43:52.881 --> 43:54.423
It's about fucking time!

43:56.593 --> 43:59.178
Ride in that Humvee. Let's go!
Let's go! In the Humvee.

43:59.387 --> 44:02.056
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, come on, come on.

44:06.895 --> 44:08.479
Hurry up.

44:10.315 --> 44:11.774
Let's go.

44:32.462 --> 44:34.505
Stupid son of a bitch.
We were home free!

44:34.756 --> 44:36.423
Give me that arm.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.971
What's that tank doing?

44:44.558 --> 44:46.559
I don't know. Looks like it stopped.

45:26.975 --> 45:27.975
Mortar!

45:32.355 --> 45:33.480
It's gas!

45:49.623 --> 45:51.498
Where's my mask?

45:53.293 --> 45:54.877
Where's my fucking mask?

45:58.715 --> 45:59.882
Where's my mask?

46:01.009 --> 46:02.009
Mine!

47:26.886 --> 47:29.263
Hey, stop! Stop!

47:29.597 --> 47:33.058
Hey! Wait! Those are mines!

47:36.229 --> 47:37.938
Come back this way!

47:40.483 --> 47:42.151
Hey, stop!

48:04.674 --> 48:07.426
No, no, no, this isn't sarin.
We'd be dead already.

48:07.594 --> 48:09.970
- What is it, mustard?
- It's C.S. Come on.

48:10.138 --> 48:14.099
- Tear gas?
- Yeah, times 10.

48:18.521 --> 48:21.231
Come here. Come here. Put this on.

48:22.484 --> 48:23.817
Here, you take it.

48:25.445 --> 48:27.362
You see that? That's a mine!
Come here.

48:27.530 --> 48:30.824
Don't step there. Do not step there.
Where's your kids?

48:34.871 --> 48:36.705
Cover your face. Come here.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.999
Where are your children?

48:39.167 --> 48:41.085
What happened to your children?

48:44.839 --> 48:45.839
Watch your back!

48:47.717 --> 48:48.717
Freeze! Don't move!

48:48.968 --> 48:51.303
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

48:56.434 --> 49:00.062
It's okay. They're helping us.
They're with the rebels.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.106
They got a shelter.

49:03.566 --> 49:04.942
Tunnel.

49:09.489 --> 49:11.240
Go, go. Get in!

49:11.491 --> 49:13.492
I gotta look for Barlow.

49:13.701 --> 49:15.077
Where's Troy?

49:15.328 --> 49:17.538
Wait a minute! Where's Troy?

49:17.705 --> 49:20.499
Hey, man. We gotta get out of here.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.042
Where is Troy?

49:22.293 --> 49:23.961
- Come on!
- Get off me!

49:25.213 --> 49:26.630
Let's go.

49:30.844 --> 49:34.805
You motherfucker.
Get the fuck off me!

49:45.733 --> 49:47.734
Barlow?

49:48.653 --> 49:50.320
Barlow?

50:31.654 --> 50:33.989
Get the fuck off me.

50:35.450 --> 50:37.784
We have to go back and get Troy.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.287
He's not out there.
We have to wait till it clears.

50:40.455 --> 50:42.831
You made a choice in the village
and we lost Troy.

50:43.124 --> 50:45.042
- I had no choice.
- You had a choice!

50:45.293 --> 50:47.502
I had no choice.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.549
What about Troy?
What choice does he have now?

51:46.396 --> 51:48.272
Paco, start shooting!

51:48.523 --> 51:51.858
I don't like this. We should go.

51:52.277 --> 51:54.987
Let me handle this.

52:09.043 --> 52:11.795
- Get dressed! Get dressed!
- Okay.

52:12.046 --> 52:13.046
I said okay!

52:36.612 --> 52:38.322
Fuck!

52:47.498 --> 52:50.292
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

52:50.460 --> 52:51.585
- Could you...?
- Yes, sir?

52:51.753 --> 52:52.836
I have a little problem.

52:53.046 --> 52:55.422
I need to know the number.
What number, please?

52:55.590 --> 52:57.174
Operation Desert Storm.

52:57.342 --> 52:59.134
I'm sorry? I need to know the number.

52:59.427 --> 53:01.720
The big Army in the desert.
It's an emergency.

53:01.971 --> 53:04.681
- You'll have to give me more specific...
- Fuck. Maybe...

53:08.478 --> 53:10.771
Come on, come on, come on.

53:24.327 --> 53:25.952
- Hello.
- Honey, it's me.

53:26.162 --> 53:27.371
Troy? Aah!

53:27.538 --> 53:31.124
Oh, my God! Oh, baby,
I was hoping it was you.

53:31.334 --> 53:34.294
- It's me, honey.
- Oh, God, the baby's crying.

53:34.462 --> 53:35.462
How's she doing?

53:35.671 --> 53:40.050
She hasn't slept good, and Mom had to
go back to work, so I'm real tired, baby.

53:40.301 --> 53:44.012
- I wish I was there to help, gooney bird.
- When are you coming home?

53:44.263 --> 53:46.223
Well, I'm working on that right now.

53:46.474 --> 53:49.559
I saw an ad for a computer job.
You want me to set up an interview?

53:49.811 --> 53:52.020
- Listen, honey...
- What date are you coming home?

53:52.271 --> 53:54.189
They haven't given us
an exact date yet...

53:54.440 --> 53:56.316
If I knew,
I could set up this interview...

53:56.567 --> 53:58.610
- Listen to me, please.
- What's happening?

53:59.987 --> 54:02.072
- What was that?
- The wall just exploded.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.490
I thought the war was over.

54:03.658 --> 54:06.243
It is and it isn't.
Could you call the reserve center?

54:06.411 --> 54:07.619
What do you want me to do?

54:07.870 --> 54:11.498
Tell the duty NCO I'm stuck in a bunker
near 223 north outside Karbala.

54:11.666 --> 54:14.751
Two-two-three north outside Karbala.

54:15.044 --> 54:18.004
- You're okay? Everything's okay?
- I don't want you to worry.

54:18.214 --> 54:20.841
I tried to do something
for the family, and....

54:21.092 --> 54:23.427
- I just want you to know...
- Know what?

54:23.636 --> 54:25.095
- I love you.
- What's going on?

54:25.263 --> 54:26.805
- Just tell Krystal.
- Troy.

54:28.182 --> 54:31.518
Tell Krystal I'm a rich man and if things
work out, she'll be taken care of.

54:31.686 --> 54:32.978
What are you talking about?

54:33.187 --> 54:36.189
- I gotta go, gooney bird! I love you!
- What's going on?

54:36.357 --> 54:38.900
Troy? Troy?

54:48.828 --> 54:51.079
Spirits are high
and the music is soaring...

54:51.330 --> 54:54.791
...as these young troops
celebrate the liberation of Kuwait.

54:55.042 --> 54:58.962
The mood here is boisterous and giddy,
as these troops are...

54:59.213 --> 55:02.090
I'm being held by a bunker outside...
Shit! Wait!

55:02.383 --> 55:06.970
I'm being held captive by Iraqi troops
outside a bunker near the gritty city...

55:07.221 --> 55:10.390
Cut, cut! You said "gritty city" again.

55:10.641 --> 55:13.768
Who gives a shit what I said?
These people are dying, for chrissake!

55:14.228 --> 55:17.939
- What about Private Wogaman, Adriana?
- Let's lay one down first.

55:18.149 --> 55:21.318
In three, two....
I'm being held captive by Iraqi troops....

55:21.736 --> 55:25.489
Okay. Okay. Okay.

55:25.656 --> 55:26.907
The rebels have gone down the road....

55:27.074 --> 55:28.074
Okay.

55:35.291 --> 55:39.211
Now, the assault, started by
the rebels from Karbala, came up on...

55:39.462 --> 55:41.505
Hey, back off! Hey, hey! No!

55:41.672 --> 55:44.424
- Sir, that's enough!
- We have a right to be here!

55:45.092 --> 55:46.259
That's mine.

55:46.427 --> 55:47.427
- Yes.
- No.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.429
Yes. Fuck it. Walter?

55:49.597 --> 55:51.973
- Could I have my pants, please?
- Walter?

55:52.141 --> 55:54.059
- My pants, on my legs.
- Go!

55:54.227 --> 55:55.936
Walter?

55:56.979 --> 55:59.022
- Go!
- Out! Get out!

56:01.359 --> 56:03.109
What did you wanna be as a little boy?

56:03.319 --> 56:07.280
As a boy, I wanted to be either
a veterinarian or a CIA sharpshooter.

56:07.448 --> 56:09.866
- Really? That's very complicated.
- Doug?

56:10.034 --> 56:11.409
Yes, colonel.

56:12.119 --> 56:15.288
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm giving an interview to NRG.

56:15.456 --> 56:18.333
- Do you have authorization?
- Yes, sir, I do.

56:23.798 --> 56:24.798
No.

56:24.966 --> 56:26.466
- No?
- No.

56:26.634 --> 56:28.260
- Who gave you this?
- Major Gates.

56:28.511 --> 56:32.222
Archie Gates gave you this?
Jesus Christ, Doug.

56:32.473 --> 56:35.976
- I don't get to do the interview?
- No, you don't get to do the interview.

56:36.143 --> 56:37.435
Come with me.

56:38.854 --> 56:42.566
Tell me where he is, or you're going
back to the hotel in Dhahran.

56:42.817 --> 56:45.277
I don't know. I think
he's helping Adriana Cruz.

56:45.528 --> 56:46.861
- Is she here?
- No, sir.

56:47.071 --> 56:48.363
So who else is missing?

56:48.531 --> 56:50.240
- Chief's not here.
- Chief's not here?

56:50.408 --> 56:52.826
You don't know where
your staff sergeant is, captain?

56:52.994 --> 56:54.578
Barlow and Vig are gone too, sir.

56:54.829 --> 56:57.789
They got a document
out of a guy's ass yesterday, sir.

56:58.624 --> 56:59.666
What?

56:59.834 --> 57:03.587
I don't know what it was. Some map
or secret list. But I saw it happen.

57:03.838 --> 57:06.006
- Did they bring it to you?
- No, sir.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.466
Yeah, see, he's working something.

57:08.843 --> 57:10.844
Get me some maps.
Check radio transmissions.

57:11.012 --> 57:12.929
Maybe we'll get their positions.

58:17.995 --> 58:20.830
What's wrong with him? Is he dead?

58:21.082 --> 58:23.750
Is that guy dead?
Where are you gonna put him?

58:24.168 --> 58:25.919
A shrine.

58:26.128 --> 58:28.755
A shrine? What kind of shrine y'all got?

58:28.923 --> 58:30.465
A shrine near a holy man...

58:30.883 --> 58:34.469
...that gives him comfort
and access to paradise.

58:35.971 --> 58:39.224
Hey, that sounds like
a pretty good shrine, right, chief?

58:40.393 --> 58:43.061
I'm not kidding.
It sounds like a good shrine.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.774
Hey, man, I'm sorry I hit you.

58:48.150 --> 58:51.611
I was just worried about Troy,
you know. He's my friend.

58:52.113 --> 58:53.863
I didn't want nothing
to happen to him.

58:54.615 --> 58:58.785
He's gonna take me to Detroit
with him, hook me up with a job.

58:59.078 --> 59:00.578
Come on, man. Chief.

59:05.418 --> 59:07.460
I know you was coming to help me.

59:14.176 --> 59:16.052
Thanks. I don't wanna hold no grudges.

59:16.929 --> 59:19.639
You got kicked out of that
ring of Jesus fire, huh?

59:19.807 --> 59:21.808
That ain't how it work.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.185
How's it work?

59:24.478 --> 59:27.814
I take care of whatever he puts
in front of me, no questions asked.

59:28.065 --> 59:30.734
He put that gold in front of me,
and I took it.

59:31.026 --> 59:32.902
That's how it works.

59:33.195 --> 59:34.988
What about now?

59:35.614 --> 59:37.991
I don't know. I gotta see.

59:40.995 --> 59:44.247
- How you doing, Conrad?
- I'm fine.

59:48.002 --> 59:49.377
It was my choice today.

59:50.337 --> 59:53.965
You can try and head back if you want.
Take your share and bury it.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.551
I'll find Barlow myself.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.180
I wanna find Troy.

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:02.432
I'm here. I'm ready.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.607
Let's check the suitcases.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.449
I count 79.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.368
That means we're missing 41 bags.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:25.079
That's about $23 million left.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:30.084
Not bad for a disaster, provided we find
Barlow and not get court-martialed.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.253
How is she?

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.173
Hey. How is your little girl?

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.135
She's traumatized.
What do you expect?

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:43.598
I went to B-school
at Bowling Green, okay?

01:00:43.766 --> 01:00:46.893
I came back to open
a couple of hotels near Karbala.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.896
I'm nearly in the black
when this stupid war starts...

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:52.398
...and you guys bomb all my cafÃ©s.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:54.400
Now we try to get rid of Saddam...

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:58.404
...Bush leaves us twisting in the winds.
Unbelievable.

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:05.245
Look at these people.
Where is America now?

01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:07.121
Where is the Army now?

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.961
- Do you have a radio?
- No.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.921
No radio, no water.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.758
- Where's Barlow?
- They got him.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.426
Where would they take him?

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.638
Oasis bunker.
It's full of Saddam's Republican Guard.

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.766
- Where's that?
- Approximately 17, 18 miles from here.

01:01:26.976 --> 01:01:28.977
- Take us there.
- We have no transportation.

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:32.856
- We'll walk till we find some.
- Why don't you call in the Marines?

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.233
- With what? We don't have a radio.
- Okay.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:39.946
We'll find a vehicle, you drive back,
get a helicopter, fly in, get your man.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.824
- We can't do that.
- Why not? You have a huge Army here.

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:44.951
We shouldn't be involved
in the uprising.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.496
We killed Iraqi soldiers,
broke the peace accord.

01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:50.123
You know what I think?

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:54.502
You're stealing gold. We're fighting Saddam
and dying, and you're stealing gold.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.671
You're wrong.

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:58.756
They have half a million men here.

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:02.343
They send four guys
to pick up all this bullion?

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.178
I don't think so.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:09.893
We need to find our man.
How much do you want to take us to him?

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.313
Is this still yours to give? Huh?

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.983
The only reason you have these bags
is my people picked them up.

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:19.068
We'll take our share...

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.988
...and we will help you
carry your share.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.241
And find our man.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:29.871
Amir Abdulah.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:32.999
Archie Gates.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.419
- You'll take us to the Iranian border.
- What?

01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:40.214
If we don't get to a refugee camp,
we are dead. The nearest is in Iran.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.175
You don't need us. Buy your way.

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:45.261
No. Saddam's soldiers
will never take Saddam's gold.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:47.764
Our only chance
is if we are with Americans.

01:02:48.015 --> 01:02:51.309
- We can't take you to the Iranian border.
- Then we don't have a deal.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:54.103
- Give me a fucking break, man.
- We just saved your life!

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:56.564
- And we saved yours.
- We lost a man for you.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:59.984
What good is it if you leave us here
to be slaughtered, huh?

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:04.447
The big Army of democracy beats the ugly
dictator and saves the rich Kuwaitis...

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:09.327
...but you go to jail if you help us
escape the same dictator?

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.540
You saw what happened to my wife.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:16.709
Look at my daughter.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.465
Who's going?

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.218
Everyone but the priests. That makes 55.

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:40.775
Did we save anything from the Humvee?

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:44.237
Yeah. Vig's bag.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:50.785
Lovely.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.248
What is your rank, bro?

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:57.166
Sergeant first class.

01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:58.918
Your company?

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:02.505
437 Civil Affairs Company,
U.S. Army Reserve.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.759
My main man...

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.096
...tell me something, okay?

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.641
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:16.477
What do you mean?

01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:20.106
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:28.072
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.533
You understand my question?

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.119
No, I'm not sure I do.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:37.165
The King of Pop. Woo-hoo. Hee, hee.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:38.624
Yeah, Michael Jackson.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.461
He come to Egypt.
I see picture in newspaper.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:45.381
"Hello," with the white glove.
"I'm Michael Jackson in my hotel room...

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:50.011
...with my chop-up face."
Your country make him chop up his face.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:51.637
I don't think so.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:55.183
Michael Jackson is pop king
of sick fucking country.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.560
That's bullshit. He did it to himself.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.359
You are the blind bullshit, my main man.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.779
It is so obvious a black man...

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:11.657
...make the skin white and the hair
straight, and you know why?

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:13.284
No.

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:16.996
Your sick fucking country
make the black man hate himself...

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:20.792
...just like you hate the Arab
and the children you bomb over here.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.668
I don't hate children.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:26.005
- This is illegal. The war's over.
- That's why you are illegal.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:29.342
You broke the ceasefire,
and I think maybe even you steal the gold.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:33.179
So nobody know where you are, right?
Your Army don't know.

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:37.433
I'm gonna send you to Baghdad
for a long time. Nobody found you.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.190
- Do they care, buddy?
- Does who care?

01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:47.819
Do your Army care about the children
in Iraq? Do they come back to help?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.655
No, they're not coming.

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:06.254
Do your Army...

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.589
- ...come back to help the people?
- No.

01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:11.259
Tell the truth, dude-ski.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:13.261
Save us the big bummer.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:15.221
That's the truth.

01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:47.420
Does it hurt?

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:51.632
I asked you a question, man.
Does it hurt?

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.426
Yes, it hurts.

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.471
You bomb my family. Do you know that?

01:06:58.891 --> 01:07:02.101
You blow up my home. The whole street.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.813
My wife is crushed by
big fucking block of concrete.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.274
She lose her legs.

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:11.152
Those legs cut off now.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.779
- That's horrible.
- What?

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.407
I said that's horrible.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:20.578
Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even
told you the horrible part yet.

01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:25.458
My son....

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.502
My son was killed in his bed.

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:33.466
He is 1 years old.

01:07:33.634 --> 01:07:36.302
He is sleeping with his toy
when the bomb come.

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.308
I have a daughter.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.852
Very nice for you, bro.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.229
She's safe in Arizona...

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.649
...without the bomb, the concrete
and all this shit.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.193
I'm not from Arizona.

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:55.571
How old is she?

01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.532
One month old.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.618
What's her name?

01:08:02.663 --> 01:08:03.871
Krystal.

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:08.000
What make you decide to tell me
about Krystal, my main man?

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.504
Because we're both fathers.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.007
I'm not father no more, dude.
Remember?

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:17.801
My son is dead now.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:23.599
Can you think how it feel
inside your heart...

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.768
...if I bomb your daughter?

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.649
Worse than death.

01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:37.571
That's right. Worse than death.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:11.022
Y'all think America is Satan, right?
America is Satan?

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.234
What'd they say?

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.404
They say he want salon.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.907
- A what?
- A salon. Hair salon.

01:09:22.117 --> 01:09:23.326
You cut hair?

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:25.368
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:30.457
Look, they don't care if they cut
American hair, Shiite hair, Sunni hair.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:36.255
They just want get rid of Saddam
and live life. Make business.

01:09:41.053 --> 01:09:43.595
He wants to know,
do you want to kill every Arab?

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:45.264
That's what I was trained to do.

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:49.352
No. That was not our training.
We got Arab allies, man.

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:51.228
Yeah, well, we got Arab allies.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.276
He says, "So you don't want to
kill every Arab."

01:09:57.444 --> 01:09:59.695
- Well, not...
- He's just had no high school.

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.781
- No high school.
- Don't tell people that.

01:10:06.787 --> 01:10:12.041
- What'd they say?
- He says you have terrible haircut.

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.878
Troy gave me this haircut.
It's a badass haircut.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.255
Yeah!

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.552
America!

01:10:24.096 --> 01:10:27.681
- America!
- America!

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.146
America, welcome.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.970
Welcome, America! Welcome!

01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:15.688
Major Gates.

01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:18.149
- How you doing?
- He says, "How are you?"

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.859
He's happy to welcome America.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.861
- Thank you.
- We welcome America.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:25.573
They're all deserters.
They leave Saddam army.

01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:28.284
- But they help us near Karbala. Good man.
- Karbala.

01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:30.578
Welcome, America.

01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:38.752
No, no, my friend. The man don't do that.
Only the woman.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:44.216
- Why's that?
- Because it's their custom.

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.469
- You have a radio?
- No radio.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:48.971
George Bush get rid Saddams now?

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.807
- Not exactly, no.
- Congratulation!

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.309
Congratulation!

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.062
Would you inform this gentleman
we need a vehicle of some kind?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.250
From Kuwait.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.603
Man, let me ask you a question.

01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:40.606
Does Lexus make this model?

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.525
Infiniti convertible only.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.860
No Lexus convertible. Infiniti only.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:46.445
Infiniti only.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.239
Exactly what I said.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:52.159
Listen. We use these cars
to fight Saddam's soldiers.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.955
What's so funny?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.289
Cannot take.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:01.460
What you mean, cannot take?
We kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely take.

01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:03.379
We are the United States Army.

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:06.632
You are three guys with a bunch
of civilians and no Humvee.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.760
Need money. Have no money.
To eat, to live.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:16.642
"American Army is huge. It has planes
and tanks, and we have nothing."

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:20.312
Listen to me.
We will rise up together. Tell him.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:21.647
Rise up.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.650
Look at us. Many races.

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:28.320
Many nations, many nations.
Working together.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:30.322
- Tell him, chief.
- Yes. We're united.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:31.657
United.

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.243
George Bush. George Bush wants you.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:35.744
You. You.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.162
Stand up for yourself.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.500
- George Bush?
- Wants you!

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:42.793
- You!
- Wants you.

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.003
- You!
- Yes!

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.172
- He wants everybody.
- Yes. Me and you stand up together.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.466
We fight. Kick Saddam's ass!

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:50.676
Huh?

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:54.847
- George Bush wants you.
- Yes.

01:13:55.015 --> 01:13:56.265
- He wants you.
- Yes.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:03.939
He wants you!
Make the fight for freedom on your own!

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.692
- Then America will follow.
- Praise the Lord!

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:09.695
God bless America,
and God bless a free Iraq!

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:19.246
Free Iraq! Free Iraq!

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:23.083
- Free Iraq! Free Iraq!
- Free Iraq!

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.501
Free Iraq!

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:26.462
Now, what do you say, my friend?

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:28.213
Cannot give car. Ha, ha.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.383
Okay. I guess we'll buy them.

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:45.522
Come on, man. This is good music.
Man, Judas Priest will pump you up, man.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:48.776
No! We're not listening to that
headache music. Stop.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:53.447
- Just one song.
- What you need is easy-listening classics.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.532
I do not need that.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.411
- You need something to calm your nerve.
- Not easy-listening classics.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.414
All right, try this.

01:15:11.299 --> 01:15:15.010
Sir, this is from Barlow's wife in Detroit.
They may have a position on him.

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.429
From his wife in Detroit?

01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:20.182
What the hell is this?

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:24.978
The war is over, and I don't fucking know
what it was about. What was this war about?

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:27.481
- I was managed by the military.
- Me too.

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.484
I try to be substance-based,
not style-based.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:32.111
I think you got a lot of style.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.154
That little Cathy bitch says I'm old.

01:15:34.406 --> 01:15:36.115
That's because she's jealous.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:39.827
First of all, you are smarter than her,
and that is a threat.

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:44.498
And second of all, you are beautiful.
You're the most prettiest woman...

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.875
- ...down there at that network.
- Thank you.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:51.588
You got great skin, beautiful hair.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:54.466
That's sweet, but there's
sexual politics in this business.

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:58.095
It's about looks, it's about sex,
it's about style.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.848
Many an anchormen came on to me.
I didn't go for it.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:04.393
I never played that game, never dropped
to my knees for an assignment.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:08.647
Christ, I came out to the desert because
nobody else had the fucking balls to do it.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:16.530
I only joined Saddam Hussein army
to make good living for my family.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.241
Good house.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.618
Now I can't get out.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:25.414
I joined up for the extra cash too.

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.332
Found out I was gonna have a baby.

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:31.712
You know, I got
weapon and training from America.

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.213
Bullshit.

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:35.674
Oh, yeah?
How you think I learned my English?

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.426
Specialist guys come here...

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:40.179
...to train us when we fight Iran.

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:41.847
What'd they train you in?

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.183
Weapons, sabotage...

01:16:44.476 --> 01:16:45.642
...interrogation.

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.145
Great.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:52.691
It was a total waste for your Army
to come to Iraq, right?

01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:55.611
I heard about a lot of bad shit
that happened in Kuwait.

01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.947
Yeah, bad shit happened.
I'm not proud of that.

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:00.699
Who's got the sick country?

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:02.701
Maybe Saddam is very crazy.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.245
And then you are crazy
to bomb all of Iraq.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.540
Too much bombing is crazy,
but not saving Kuwait.

01:17:09.918 --> 01:17:12.336
- You are here for save Kuwaiti people?
- Yes.

01:17:12.504 --> 01:17:15.047
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:18.635 --> 01:17:21.136
A lot of people
in trouble in this world, my man...

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.555
...and you don't fight
no fucking war for them.

01:17:23.723 --> 01:17:27.434
- You invaded another country. Can't do that.
- Why not, dude?

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:30.187
It makes the world crazy.
You need to keep it stable.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.397
For what? Your pickup truck?

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:36.026
No, for stability. Stabilize the region.

01:17:52.085 --> 01:17:54.837
This is your fucking stability,
my main man.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:09.935
We get our man, and then we
come back and pick up the gold.

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.104
- And my people?
- That's right.

01:18:13.773 --> 01:18:15.190
Let's go over the plan.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:18.277
Let's do it.

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:22.865
There's a bunker built into
the side of the cliff face.

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:26.535
It looks like a castle. There's a road
coming there, another one across.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:31.248
It's full of Saddam's Republican Guard.
Now, I don't think we can overpower them.

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:32.666
There's too many.

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:36.461
- But there's one thing they're afraid of.
- What's that?

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:38.130
Saddam.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.841
Then that's what we use.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:43.510
Right. That's what we'll use.

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.971
You stay with me.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.266
You stay with me.

01:18:57.275 --> 01:19:00.611
Wait, hold on a minute. I wanna
go over this plan one more time.

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.321
You're scared, right?

01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:04.406
Maybe.

01:19:04.616 --> 01:19:07.993
The way this works is, you do
the thing you're scared shitless of...

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:11.747
...and you get the courage after
you do it. Not before you do it.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.710
That's a dumb-ass way to work.
It should be the other way around.

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.503
I know.

01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:20.756
That's the way it works.

01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:54.891
If you leave me now

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:59.604
You'll take away the biggest part of me

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:07.154
No, baby, please don't go

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:17.372
You'll take away the very heart of me

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:25.047
No, baby, please don't go

01:21:36.267 --> 01:21:39.227
Ow! I got a splinter.

01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:49.548
How could we let it slip away?

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:18.410
Jesus fire, Jesus fire, Jesus fire....

01:24:09.837 --> 01:24:10.879
Come on.

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:14.382
Quickly, quickly.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.525
Oh, shit.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.678
You all right?

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:02.389
Oh, shit, you're dead.

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.497
Wait! Wait!

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:35.964
Shit.

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.843
Get back. Get back inside.

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:53.440
Come on. Amir, come on.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:27:00.131
- Huh? How you feel?
- Stop!

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:03.259
I told you....

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.769
Let's get out of here.

01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:33.475
Where's Conrad?

01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:40.648
Keep your guard up.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.292
Barlow, are you okay?

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:02.212
Chief. Where's Conrad?
How we getting back, man?

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:04.339
- We got the Rolls.
- You got a Rolls?

01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:08.092
- Yeah.
- Hey. Hey.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.804
This is an Infiniti convertible.

01:29:13.432 --> 01:29:14.891
Man, I think you're in shock.

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:20.605
- It's an Infiniti convertible, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

01:29:20.773 --> 01:29:23.274
Okay, so I owe you a car.
I'm not in shock.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:24.817
You sure you're okay?

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:26.528
Hey, freeze!

01:29:27.947 --> 01:29:29.239
No! He's with us!

01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:31.950
Don't shoot him. He's with us!

01:29:32.535 --> 01:29:35.286
- You're the guy with the little girl?
- That's right.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.704
What are you doing here?

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:39.624
- He helped us find you.
- I came here to help you.

01:29:40.543 --> 01:29:42.961
All right. You're all right, man.

01:29:46.507 --> 01:29:47.924
I see some people.

01:29:48.175 --> 01:29:50.134
I can't see what's happening. Stay put.

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:52.887
- How's your little girl?
- She's safe for now.

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.390
Outstanding, excellent.
How can we help you?

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:59.644
We had a deal to get to the border, but now
we have more people and need vehicles.

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:01.771
That's not a problem.
We'll work it out.

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:04.148
We have to do this.
We can work it out, okay?

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:05.942
I don't know. It's a lot of people.

01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:10.405
Okay, well, then you choose who we take.
Tell the others they're gonna have to die...

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:11.823
...because I can't do that.

01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:15.034
- You're gonna have to do it yourself.
- Okay, okay.

01:30:16.287 --> 01:30:17.328
Okay.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.919
- Troy! You made it, man!
- Conrad!

01:30:25.087 --> 01:30:26.421
I thought that was you.

01:30:27.006 --> 01:30:28.798
Where the fuck have you been?

01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:34.679
Conrad!

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:50.111
- What are you wearing?
- What?

01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:51.613
What is this?

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.657
Oh, it's a suit jacket.
The Iraqis gave it to me.

01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:57.452
- I didn't recognize you in it.
- it fits all right, right?

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.163
- Yeah.
- Hey, chief! We need your help!

01:31:00.998 --> 01:31:03.916
- I'm okay.
- Where's he hit?

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:06.961
It's in and out. I think
it's just above his collarbone.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.839
Where's the Jesus fire?

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:12.717
It's all around you right now.
You're gonna be all right.

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:15.803
- You're gonna be all right, man.
- I'm going to hell.

01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:17.722
You're gonna be fine.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:22.101
Can you take me to a shrine that gives you
comfort and erases the bad things you did?

01:31:22.353 --> 01:31:24.937
- Hey. We made the right choice today.
- Shh, shh.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.815
You stop with that shrine shit.
Everything'll be okay.

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:30.109
- You think so?
- I know so!

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.362
We're getting out of here. Hey, major!

01:31:32.613 --> 01:31:33.905
Would you please fucking help...?

01:31:35.741 --> 01:31:37.784
Goddamn it!

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:43.122
Troy.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.098
What's the matter, man?

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:02.266
Can you breathe?

01:32:03.227 --> 01:32:05.269
Can you breathe?

01:32:35.968 --> 01:32:39.137
There's air in his chest.
It's crushing his lung.

01:33:22.389 --> 01:33:24.265
- Does that feel better, man?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:27.852
- That feel better?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.402
He's gone.

01:33:39.615 --> 01:33:42.325
Air pressure's gonna build up
about every 15 minutes.

01:33:42.493 --> 01:33:44.243
Release the valve
and close it back up.

01:33:45.871 --> 01:33:48.164
- How long can I keep doing that?
- I don't know.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:52.710
Maybe four or five hours, if you're not
bleeding too bad. You don't seem to be.

01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:39.674
He said he wanted
to go to one of those shrines.

01:34:40.259 --> 01:34:42.260
Did he mean that?

01:34:42.427 --> 01:34:44.220
That's what he told me.

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:48.015
Qum in Iran. We can take him with us.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:50.893
Then take him.

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:55.857
All right. We'll take him there.

01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:38.482
We found a radio inside.
You're hooked for that call, major.

01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:52.163
Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

01:35:52.539 --> 01:35:53.998
We're going to jail.

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:58.002
No, we're not. Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:01.005
- This is Bolo. Come in.
- Where are you?

01:36:01.173 --> 01:36:03.507
About two clicks outside of camp.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.384
We're ready for that briar patch.

01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:09.805
- I wanna find out where we're going.
- Ma'am, please. I'm transmitting code here!

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:13.351
- You got me, Bolo?
- I think so.

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:16.020
Who handles the briar patch?

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.189
- You do.
- Oh, okay.

01:36:18.357 --> 01:36:21.233
Tar Baby goes to the briar patch
if everything's okay, right?

01:36:21.526 --> 01:36:23.945
- No, it's the other way around.
- Right.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:27.031
I'm sorry, sir. I don't remember
how the code goes.

01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:30.660
I need four personnel trucks
and a Humvee.

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:33.913
That's a pretty tall order
for a secret operation, sir.

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:38.376
Talk to my friend Teebaux.
Each driver will get 100K.

01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:40.294
Brer Rabbit at 239 north.

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:44.382
Add one medevac pack to the order.
Make sure you bring the reporter.

01:36:44.675 --> 01:36:46.592
Roger. Give me two hours.

01:37:32.806 --> 01:37:34.932
Bury those real good, chief.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:39.937
After we take these people to the border,
we'll figure out a way to get it out of here.

01:37:40.272 --> 01:37:44.108
Two-two-three north is the position his wife
called in. There's an empty bunker.

01:37:44.276 --> 01:37:46.861
Task air recon to cover
223 north to the border.

01:37:47.029 --> 01:37:50.781
- I'll put choppers on standby.
- If they're there, they won't be hard to find.

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:52.783
All the way, sir.

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:22.563
Are you all right?

01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:25.441
It's not me.
Barlow could use some morphine.

01:38:25.692 --> 01:38:27.777
They've got him.
Let's see about you first.

01:38:41.792 --> 01:38:44.543
- Did you get the gold?
- No, but we helped a lot of people.

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:47.505
Right now we have to get them
over the border.

01:38:48.465 --> 01:38:52.301
- They'll be killed without our protection.
- They're gonna bust you for that.

01:38:52.469 --> 01:38:54.512
Then cover it and see what happens.

01:39:06.191 --> 01:39:07.942
Hey.

01:39:08.527 --> 01:39:10.444
- You sure you're not coming with us?
- No.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:12.696
I will stay here to fight Saddam.

01:39:15.325 --> 01:39:16.367
Good luck.

01:39:23.208 --> 01:39:25.209
Sit down. We're gonna pull out fast, okay?

01:39:25.377 --> 01:39:27.211
Everybody sit down. We're pulling off.

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:30.464
- Walter, did you meet everybody?
- Walter, this is Kaied.

01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:32.842
Hi, Kaied.

01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:45.915
What are you thinking?

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:52.713
We walk them past
the Iraqi soldiers. Make sure they're safe.

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:55.466
We walk back to the trucks
and we get out of here.

01:40:55.926 --> 01:40:58.052
All right, let's do it!

01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:05.392
No guns. Only American soldiers
carry guns.

01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:12.983
We are just now about....

01:41:13.235 --> 01:41:17.738
We're getting it now? We're about
25 yards from an Iraqi checkpoint...

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:19.990
...heading into Iran.

01:41:20.492 --> 01:41:24.954
We are just about to move across
the zone up into the Iranian border.

01:41:25.664 --> 01:41:27.289
It's a barbed-wire point.

01:41:27.457 --> 01:41:30.918
We have men, women and children here...

01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:34.964
...assumed to be Iraqi refugees
crossing over into Iran.

01:41:35.215 --> 01:41:38.300
- Make sure they take care of Conrad.
- I will.

01:41:38.802 --> 01:41:42.054
...ally of the United States
would be not an ally of the United States.

01:41:42.222 --> 01:41:46.016
We did see a lot of Iraqi soldiers.
They are here, up in bunkers.

01:41:46.268 --> 01:41:47.977
Keep in a tight group.

01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:52.690
They're going through
some kind of checkpoint.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:55.526
This is a violation of American policy.

01:41:55.694 --> 01:41:59.238
The United States has
withdrawn its support.

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:05.160
- Okay. Let's cut and go again.
- Okay.

01:42:06.538 --> 01:42:11.166
Officially supported by
the United States, they are refugees now...

01:42:11.334 --> 01:42:13.377
...um, trying to escape
from Saddam Hussein...

01:42:16.715 --> 01:42:21.385
The refugees are 150 yards
from the border of Iran.

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:26.890
Uh, the Americans here are not supposed
to be escorting anyone across the border....

01:42:29.686 --> 01:42:33.647
You are AWOL, and you
are in violation of American policy.

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.065
You are under arrest.

01:42:35.275 --> 01:42:37.401
Double-time. Let's go!

01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:39.737
We can make it before they stop us.

01:42:39.904 --> 01:42:44.742
...to make it across the border
before the Americans land and stop them.

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:48.078
Come on. Move, move!

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:53.917
Arrest them. Get them away
from those refugees.

01:42:55.128 --> 01:42:56.337
Let's go!

01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:00.591
Come here. Come here.

01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:02.926
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. Come on.

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:04.595
- Come on.
- Watch out! Unh!

01:43:04.763 --> 01:43:08.682
- You're under arrest!
- Let me just help these people get across!

01:43:12.979 --> 01:43:15.189
Let me get her over! Ah!

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:17.816
- Let me get her over!
- Wait! Wait!

01:43:17.984 --> 01:43:20.861
Just let them get over first! Wait!

01:43:21.029 --> 01:43:23.989
I need to reach this valve in my chest.

01:43:25.158 --> 01:43:27.284
Look what's happening!
Just let them get over!

01:43:27.577 --> 01:43:30.371
Help these people get across
and I'll go with you!

01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:33.040
Let me get them across,
and I'll go right with you.

01:43:33.333 --> 01:43:36.502
- Let's go. You're coming with me!
- Wait. Wait.

01:43:39.422 --> 01:43:41.840
They'll get slaughtered
if we don't help them across!

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:44.385
Why you doing this, man?
They gonna kill them!

01:43:44.761 --> 01:43:49.056
The refugees are not crossing
the border. They have been rounded up....

01:43:52.977 --> 01:43:55.020
- Just let them get over!
- Not our mission!

01:43:55.188 --> 01:43:56.480
You don't belong here!

01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:58.774
What is the matter?
You ought to know better!

01:43:58.983 --> 01:44:01.777
We're not involved in this problem,
Major Gates. Understand?

01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:03.904
You're AWOL, and you're under arrest!

01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:07.658
Are you gonna let them
kill those people? It's not right, Ron.

01:44:13.123 --> 01:44:15.499
- They're arresting them.
- I can't breathe!

01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:18.669
Hey! You fucked me, now you're fucked!
So shut your mouth!

01:44:18.837 --> 01:44:21.004
...of American policy, major.
Do you understand?

01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:24.007
- I need to reach this!
- Give this man medical attention.

01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:26.427
We're not involved in this problem here.

01:44:26.636 --> 01:44:29.930
- You're way out of line, major.
- Look at him!

01:44:30.098 --> 01:44:32.683
- I can't reach the valve!
- He can't breathe!

01:44:32.851 --> 01:44:35.519
- Put the cuffs in the front!
- He'll die if you don't...

01:44:35.687 --> 01:44:37.896
You don't worry about him!
Worry about yourself!

01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:40.023
Damn it, Ron, cut his cuffs!

01:44:41.359 --> 01:44:43.360
He can't breathe! Cut his cuffs!

01:44:43.528 --> 01:44:45.571
What the hell is this?
Turn that camera off!

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:48.657
- Hey, that's a $70,000 camera!
- What are you people doing here?

01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:51.493
- I was authorized to be here.
- You were not authorized.

01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:53.328
He's gonna die!

01:44:53.496 --> 01:44:56.915
- Why aren't you helping them?
- Because it's not our policy!

01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:58.167
Cut his cuffs!

01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:00.335
- I should tell this story!
- Out of the pool!

01:45:00.503 --> 01:45:01.587
- Bullshit!
- You're done!

01:45:23.818 --> 01:45:27.362
All we had to do was help them.
It was less than 100 feet.

01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:52.346
We got the gold.

01:45:53.097 --> 01:45:54.389
What?

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:58.018
- The Kuwaiti bullion. We've got it.
- Bullshit.

01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:02.814
- Hold that bag. Give me that bag!
- Get the bag.

01:46:17.205 --> 01:46:19.873
- How much do you have?
- Twenty-three million.

01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:21.124
- Where's it at?
- No.

01:46:21.376 --> 01:46:23.001
Get those people over first.

01:46:23.169 --> 01:46:25.337
They helped us find it, Ron.

01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:30.509
We made a deal. It's a soldier's honor.
You can't fuck them now.

01:46:32.679 --> 01:46:34.930
Come on. Return the gold.

01:46:35.848 --> 01:46:39.768
Save some refugees. Get that star.

01:46:42.814 --> 01:46:44.690
Let's go, Doug.

01:46:53.741 --> 01:46:56.159
Who's in charge here?

01:47:22.895 --> 01:47:25.188
You're under arrest.
You'll be court-martialed...

01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:27.899
...and you'll show us
where that bullion is right now.
