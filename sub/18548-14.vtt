00:15.920 --> 00:19.920
Oh, look, they must be here
for the antiques marquee.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.880
It's new this year
at the county fair.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.760
They say they may be having
fully qualified experts

00:27.800 --> 00:30.479
coming from London.
Just think of it!

00:30.480 --> 00:34.040
We might have an undiscovered
fortune right under our noses!

00:34.080 --> 00:35.480
Oh, dear.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.759
I fear Mammon is upon us.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.439
Mrs Coombes at the station

00:41.440 --> 00:44.400
said they'd all sorts
in the luggage racks.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.680
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if half the thieves in the county

00:47.720 --> 00:50.520
are making their way
to Kembleford as we speak.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.320
They've already had one theft.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.679
I got one of each kind
so we can test them all.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.000
I'm going to try the
Worcester Pearmain first, I think.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.240
Excellent choice.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.400
Welcome to Kembleford.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.360
Are you here for the county fair?
We are, yes.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.000
I'm sorry, I do apologise,
this is my daughter, Grace.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.760
My wife was Tanganyikan.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.200
Oh.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.240
Father Brown.
Hello.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.840
Aldous, Aldous Kemp.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.759
Africa! You must find everything
here very different.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.760
Are you planning on staying?
I'm going to medical school.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.759
If we can find one
that will have me.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.479
Oh, come on, any medical school
will be proud to have her.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.400
I'm sure they would.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.759
Britain has a fine tradition
of scientists

01:44.760 --> 01:47.400
inspired by apples.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.240
Come on, Grace, let's check in.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.640
And yours is this way, sir.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.480
And that was delivered for you
this morning, sir.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.080
Good day.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.640
Can I come in?

02:29.680 --> 02:30.840
One moment.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.920
You see, it has exactly the same
pattern as that old bracelet

03:27.960 --> 03:29.760
they dug up at Chedworth.

03:32.840 --> 03:38.039
Penelope, do you know anything
about antiquities?

03:38.040 --> 03:41.720
Never get anything valued
unless you can afford the insurance.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.600
Oh, yes, just my luck -

03:43.640 --> 03:45.360
the only two people in Kembleford

03:45.400 --> 03:48.040
with no interest in worldly riches.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.880
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.160
Father, you can't sell that,
it was a gift!

03:56.400 --> 03:58.640
Just curious to see
what it felt like...

04:00.560 --> 04:03.000
..to hold a new church roof
in my hands.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.799
"An early example of Harper's
English futurist style,

04:07.800 --> 04:11.000
"carved in the trenches of Arras."
£300!

04:11.040 --> 04:13.800
300?

04:13.840 --> 04:17.920
Well, I have always said
I thought that oil lamp rather...

04:17.959 --> 04:19.079
ugly.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.000
Clearly, you don't love her enough!

04:38.040 --> 04:41.280
Be careful with that, it's Roman.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.799
I was wondering if it mightn't
date from around the same time

04:43.800 --> 04:46.920
they found all those coins at
Chedworth? We're engravers,

04:46.960 --> 04:50.200
not an auction house. If you
want it cleaned, it's one and six.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.640
It's in lovely condition.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.000
And the pin and hinge fastener has
been in use since Roman settlement.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.920
Well, at least someone knows
what they're talking about.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.439
John here went to art school.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.240
Oh, is that an antique as well?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.399
Oh, yes.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.800
She's a real beauty.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.720
Sorry, no weapons.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.600
How many times do I have to say it?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.679
We do not turn customers away.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.000
If a man wants a sword cleaned,
he gets a sword cleaned.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.319
You think we can afford
to throw money away?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.360
I know how things are.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.080
I came back to help, didn't I?

05:38.160 --> 05:40.360
Let's go back to work, son.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.199
I say, I don't suppose you've come
across the antiques man from London?

05:56.200 --> 06:00.040
The only reason you want to know
is because the innkeeper's wife

06:00.080 --> 06:02.920
has been telling everyone
how dashing he is.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.599
He's staying at the inn!
Thanks, Mrs M! No...!

06:06.600 --> 06:10.520
Hello, may I deposit
an item in your safe?

06:10.560 --> 06:14.080
I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one.

06:18.440 --> 06:23.600
There's woodworm in the bureau and
the sheets have barely been ironed.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.679
Bunty Windermere.
May I assist in any way?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.120
If you know of any alternative
accommodation in Kembleford

06:30.160 --> 06:32.960
other than this hovel,
I'd be most grateful.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.600
Wynford Collins.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.040
From Chapman & Saunders,
the auction house.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.479
Have we met?

06:38.480 --> 06:40.280
You'd remember.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.279
I rather think I would.

06:42.280 --> 06:46.000
So shall I send someone up
to collect your luggage?

06:46.920 --> 06:48.800
Well, you can't stay here.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.159
We'll put you in the Chinese Room.
Wonderful view of the sunken garden.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.280
That's very good of you.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.440
Just give me five minutes to fight
the woodworm off my suitcase,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.440
and I shall return.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.840
You understand?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.320
Look, I'm sorry.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
Goodnight.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.200
Hello?

07:50.400 --> 07:56.480
Papa?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.040
Papa?!

08:17.000 --> 08:20.639
I thought the fair was that way?
Ran out of petrol!

08:20.640 --> 08:22.679
Dodgy ticker, poor thing.

08:22.680 --> 08:26.120
You know, Hornby thinks
she might have been siphoned.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.880
Really?

08:27.920 --> 08:29.360
Riff-raff from the fair.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.280
Can we offer you a lift?

08:31.320 --> 08:35.078
No, I'm afraid I am
on official business.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.880
A death at the inn.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.318
Who?

08:38.320 --> 08:41.399
A man called Aldous Kemp.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.999
How dreadful!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.839
His poor daughter.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.199
Did you know them?

08:47.200 --> 08:49.680
I met them briefly
when I was checking in.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.080
I think I met them, too.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.120
Papa goes off to bed,

08:54.160 --> 08:57.600
but the daughter stays and cries
into the tablecloth.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.559
Something was going on.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.720
Toodle-oo, Father.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.440
Requiescat in pace.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.800
Amen.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.400
Is there anything I can do?

09:26.680 --> 09:28.280
Would you like to pray?

09:29.720 --> 09:31.280
I'm an atheist.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.600
I don't want prayers.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.640
I want to know what happened.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.160
If you're done, Padre...

09:55.880 --> 09:59.880
Looks like he was planning to get
something valued at the fair.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.400
But you found nothing in the room?

10:02.440 --> 10:05.519
Someone could've taken it. There's
only three rooms on the landing.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.840
His daughter's in that one,

10:06.880 --> 10:09.159
and the one at the end
of the corridor is empty.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.960
Wouldn't have been difficult.
Yes, thank you, Goodfellow.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.680
I hope you're not interfering
with a murder weapon, Padre.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.680
I don't think it is
a murder weapon, Inspector.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.160
It hasn't been fired.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.800
And he wasn't struck with it.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.080
But it's rather old.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.080
Perhaps that was what he was
taking to the fair to be valued.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.560
You may know about many things,
Padre, but guns aren't one of them.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.320
Colonial handgun, popular with
civil servants stationed abroad.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.040
Not exactly a surprise,

11:23.080 --> 11:26.880
considering our victim worked for
the East African Postal Service.

11:26.920 --> 11:33.080
But it is a surprise that it's
out here in an herbaceous border.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.240
Goodfellow, collect the evidence
and search the area.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.080
Father.
Thank you, Sergeant.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.840
Have they found something?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.240
Your father's handgun.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.840
My father didn't have a gun.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.560
He abhorred violence.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.440
He threw his in the river
the day we left Tanganyika.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.160
This is all so...

12:12.440 --> 12:16.120
I keep imagining he's simply going
to walk in and sit down beside me.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.959
As long as I don't leave this table,

12:20.960 --> 12:22.800
he's just late for breakfast.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.519
And I can't leave,
because if I leave...

12:28.520 --> 12:30.880
it will make it real.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.320
I said some awful things.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.840
You were angry?
Selfish, stupid.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.119
I just couldn't understand.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.920
How could he suddenly not have
the money for medical school?

12:46.960 --> 12:49.000
It's what we'd come here to do.

12:50.120 --> 12:54.280
We made up before he went to bed.
I managed that much, at least.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.320
I'm so ashamed, I should never
have... No, no - sh, sh.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.400
Keep it safe.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.400
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.240
Just now... I've got to rest.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.280
Did you open the envelope?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.600
Should I have?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.800
Please can I have a hot whisky
with honey and cloves

13:30.840 --> 13:32.840
and two sticks of cinnamon?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.120
Yes.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.839
I asked them to make your drink.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.240
Shall I bring it in?

13:46.760 --> 13:49.120
You don't need to apologise, Grace.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.560
But if you leave it by the door,
I'm sure it'll find a home.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.919
I've put it outside.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.999
Usiku mwema.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.600
Lala salama.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.799
These were found
by your father's bed.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.640
Can you confirm they're his?

14:22.680 --> 14:24.640
They are.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.040
Chloroquine.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.520
He took them for malaria.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.360
Grace Kemp, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Aldous Kemp.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.159
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

14:35.160 --> 14:38.240
but whatever you say may be taken
in writing and given in evidence.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.280
Me?
I've just come from the pathologist.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.239
He believes your father's death
was caused by sleeping pills

14:44.240 --> 14:46.799
interfering with his
malaria medicine.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.679
And what appears to be sleeping pill
residue was found in the drink

14:50.680 --> 14:52.480
beside his bed.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.320
You took him this drink,
did you not?

14:55.360 --> 14:59.200
I did, but...
And you're a student of medicine.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.519
I believe you put those pills
in his drink,

15:02.520 --> 15:05.880
knowing they would react with his
malaria medication and kill him.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
Anybody else could have had
the same opportunity.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.599
Why would I do that?
He's my father.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.760
Several witnesses saw you arguing

15:13.800 --> 15:16.440
shortly before you made him
the drink.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.720
You were reported to be weeping
inconsolably after being told

15:21.760 --> 15:23.919
you couldn't go to medical school.

15:23.920 --> 15:28.240
And we both know how generous
Colonial Service death benefits are.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.839
You think I'd kill my father
for that?

15:30.840 --> 15:34.120
What kind of monster do you think
I am? We'll soon find out.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.840
Inspector! You stick to your
business, Padre, I'll stick to mine.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.159
I placed my salvation
in a rational world,

15:44.160 --> 15:47.159
in books - but now I place it
in the church.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.719
Please, Father, help me find it.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.080
Yes. I will.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.160
"Rational World."

16:59.240 --> 17:01.279
More coffee, please.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.800
And none of that powdered stuff
this time.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.000
Next.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.638
It's real gold.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.559
It came into my family from a doctor
in Blackfriars, but I believe...

17:12.560 --> 17:15.079
It's a mass-produced costume piece.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.480
Worth no more than five shillings,
I'm afraid.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.040
No, no, I think
you must be mistaken.

17:20.079 --> 17:23.200
You see, my grandmother told me
that Great-Grandpa Roberts

17:23.240 --> 17:25.598
sold his best horse to buy that.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.480
Well, then, he was either robbed
or extremely stupid.

17:28.520 --> 17:33.040
That is downright... disrespectful.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.520
They're always the same,
these yokels,

17:37.560 --> 17:39.840
getting worked up over
their cheap trinkets.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.480
Next.

17:41.520 --> 17:45.520
Or they got caught up in an opium
ring at the governor's house?

17:45.560 --> 17:49.000
The colonies are rife
with that sort of thing.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.639
Mm.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.200
Aldous Kemp didn't seem the type.
I suppose you're right.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.920
Blackmail?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.759
Ah, Boudica herself!

18:01.760 --> 18:04.560
Do tell, do we have
a Roman horde on our hands?

18:05.880 --> 18:08.039
Boudica wasn't Roman.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.720
Come on, Mrs M, spill the beans!

18:12.120 --> 18:14.199
I shall be seeking a second opinion

18:14.200 --> 18:17.200
from someone who has time
to examine it properly.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.480
Mrs McCarthy,
can we enlist your help?

18:24.960 --> 18:27.119
Grace Kemp has been arrested.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.400
Oh, now, why doesn't that
surprise me?

18:29.440 --> 18:33.440
I mean, it isn't exactly natural
for a young woman to be interested

18:33.480 --> 18:35.519
in cutting up bodies, now, is it?

18:35.520 --> 18:38.039
And her being godless, too.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.999
But the Father doesn't think
she did it.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.920
Oh?

18:42.960 --> 18:46.639
I have seen many people mourn their
parents. Her grief is genuine.

18:46.640 --> 18:50.200
Her chief defence is the gun.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.400
If Aldous Kemp did not own a gun,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.240
then someone else must have
been involved in his killing.

18:59.200 --> 19:03.760
Someone who owned a Colonial
Civil Service handgun.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.839
Oh, don't mind us.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.599
We can ask the gunsmith.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.080
If it was someone local, then they
would have bought their rounds there

19:14.120 --> 19:16.160
and it's the only one for miles.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.080
Thank you.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.720
Who?
Frank Hammond.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.000
Stuck in his mind because he usually
orders cartridges for his shotguns.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.800
Partial to rabbit stew, apparently.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.040
Duck!

19:38.320 --> 19:39.759
No, rabbit.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.120
Sorry, Father.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.400
Magnificent creatures.

19:50.720 --> 19:55.159
Although I've never understood
how killing them could be a sport.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.560
Me neither.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.800
Though it must take enormous skill
to get close to an animal like that.

20:00.840 --> 20:04.839
Hmm. Rather different than rabbits,
I suppose.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.120
Rabbits can be wily beggars
when you're onto 'em.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.159
Frightful pests, too.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.800
Daddy used to defend our lawn
with a handgun.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.280
I think I've decided on this one.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.560
The Father tells me you have
quite the collection of shotguns.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.239
Have you thought about showing
any of them to the antiques man

20:27.240 --> 20:28.319
at the Fair?

20:28.320 --> 20:31.080
Shouldn't think he'd be that
interested in a load of old guns.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.719
Oh, the older the better.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.319
A farmer brought one in, he was
using it for foxes but turns out

20:37.320 --> 20:39.600
it was a Boswell worth £50!

20:39.640 --> 20:42.680
£50? For an old shotgun?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.120
There are plenty of rich
collectors out there.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.359
I must confess, I'm a bit
of an expert myself.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.760
Would you like me to take a look
at yours?

20:49.800 --> 20:52.200
If it's not too much trouble.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.400
Just through here.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.760
Mr Hammond?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.520
Excuse me. Customer.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.720
Fascinating.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.680
I'd love to talk to your son
about his work.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.200
John's out.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.040
Please.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.040
Thank you.
Not at all.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.880
Well, guilty if ever I saw one.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.440
You forget the giraffe.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.480
A skilled engraver in this family
has spent some time in Africa

21:36.520 --> 21:39.079
and it is not Mr Hammond.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.440
What was all that about, then?

21:42.000 --> 21:47.560
Well, I would imagine that he saw
that his son's handgun was missing

21:47.600 --> 21:51.999
and then discovered that some shells
has been recently ordered

21:52.000 --> 21:53.960
and he's trying to protect him.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.639
John?!

21:55.640 --> 21:58.439
I doubt he'd hit
anything that night -

21:58.440 --> 22:01.760
he was practically on the floor
of the Red Lion when I saw him.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.080
Oh!

22:04.840 --> 22:06.759
We need to find John.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.960
Do you think he knew the Kemps
in Africa? Forbidden romance!

22:14.520 --> 22:16.200
You've got five minutes, Father.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.880
Did you find it? What did it say?

22:36.360 --> 22:37.840
I don't know what it means.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.520
Do you know a man
called John Hammond?

22:43.560 --> 22:45.720
He worked with my father.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.080
Last year, in the
East African Postal Service.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.480
He owned the gun.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.520
The one your father
threw out of the window.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.400
Is the Father here? Not unless
he's hiding under a table.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.479
Which I wouldn't put past him.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.080
Did he go with Grace?

23:07.520 --> 23:11.079
You have released her,
now you know it was John's gun?

23:11.080 --> 23:12.360
Whose gun?

23:14.840 --> 23:20.119
You are aware that withholding
evidence is a criminal offence?

23:20.120 --> 23:25.999
Yes. Which is precisely why
I came to alert you...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.640
after I had ministered
to Grace Kemp.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.079
The atheist.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.119
Of course.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.480
I'll deal with you later.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.280
I've found him.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.000
Bad day?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.080
Busy.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.199
You remind me of another
young person I know.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.959
I think you know her.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.040
Grace Kemp.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.440
You worked with her
father in Tanganyika.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.600
Must have been a surprise... when
he came into the shop yesterday.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.680
I suspect you had
a lot to catch up on.

24:11.720 --> 24:15.399
Or did you wait until later,
when you went to visit him?

24:15.400 --> 24:17.560
Why did you take your gun with you?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.200
N-no...

24:22.240 --> 24:24.640
The police found it. At the inn.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.160
I didn't do it.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.560
I didn't kill him.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.120
He was my friend.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.759
If that's true, you have nothing
to fear by confessing

24:40.760 --> 24:42.720
what happened between you.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.239
Your gun wasn't fired,

24:45.240 --> 24:47.120
it didn't kill him.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.120
It's got my fingerprints on.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.959
It was found where he died.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.160
If they print these...

24:57.200 --> 24:58.400
they'll say I did it.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.719
Ah. Good afternoon.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.519
May I help you, Inspector?

25:16.520 --> 25:17.800
Yes.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.920
By not interfering
with our investigations

25:19.960 --> 25:22.000
and letting our murderer get away.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.040
But we don't know that yet, do we?

25:29.720 --> 25:34.799
The prints we found on his gun
match the ones in Kemp's room.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.920
Your friend was there.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.840
I'm afraid you've let your faith
in people fool you again.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.200
Why did you let him escape?

25:51.840 --> 25:56.080
Oh. You don't think he did it,
do you?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.599
Why did John leave his prints
on the gun

26:00.600 --> 26:02.360
in the room

26:02.400 --> 26:04.880
if he wanted to steal something?

26:04.920 --> 26:06.640
Why not wear gloves?

26:12.760 --> 26:16.759
George, is John a regular here?

26:16.760 --> 26:20.119
Never even seen him
before yesterday morning.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.359
Drinking in the morning?

26:21.360 --> 26:23.840
No, delivers his parcel,
heads back to work,

26:23.880 --> 26:26.360
never even glances at temptation.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.159
Who was the parcel for?

26:28.160 --> 26:29.879
Well, the, uh... You know.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.720
Mr Aldous Kemp?

26:31.760 --> 26:34.960
But the police didn't even find
the parcel in his room.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.320
Or any packaging.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.560
It's just a cat.

26:57.240 --> 27:00.480
Sweet Jesus,
what on Earth are you doing?

27:00.520 --> 27:03.000
Antique hunting.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.120
In a dustbin?

27:05.160 --> 27:07.479
Is that alcohol
I smell on your breath?

27:07.480 --> 27:09.439
It's just the general ambience.

27:09.440 --> 27:13.319
And what exactly are you
expecting to find?

27:13.320 --> 27:15.320
I don't know.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.760
Well, it's just as well
you're both here.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.800
Our so-called antiques expert
told Mrs Trevithick

27:22.840 --> 27:25.079
that her necklace was worthless!

27:25.080 --> 27:27.919
And the same for
Sergeant Goodfellow's sword!

27:27.920 --> 27:30.839
In fact, I've yet to meet anyone

27:30.840 --> 27:33.160
who's been offered more than
a few shillings.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
So it is quite clear!

27:36.840 --> 27:38.719
Wynford Collins is a charlatan!

27:38.720 --> 27:41.280
Oh, well, perhaps we should
call Scotland Yard and set up

27:41.320 --> 27:43.360
a sting operation to expose him(!)

27:43.400 --> 27:46.199
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.600
Well, I can see I am going to have
to find justice on my own.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.639
Gun oil?

28:01.640 --> 28:06.480
Yes, well, that explains how
the gun got into Mr Kemp's room.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.360
But why did John give him a gun?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.000
John?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
John!

28:21.040 --> 28:23.760
What have you done? The police said
that dead man's from Africa!

28:23.800 --> 28:26.280
Just keep yourself out of this.
I warned you, didn't I?

28:26.320 --> 28:29.519
But, no, you had to have
your foolhardy job in Africa!

28:29.520 --> 28:33.520
Which you made me leave to come
back here to save your business!

28:33.560 --> 28:37.919
Like you've spent my entire life
trying to make me stay here,

28:37.920 --> 28:40.600
rather than working on my art,
pursuing a career!

28:40.640 --> 28:43.919
Career?! A career's something
you get paid for!

28:43.920 --> 28:47.400
And that's what it's always about,
isn't it? Money!

28:47.440 --> 28:50.560
Not me. Not even you.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.999
We've spent our entire lives
trapped by it.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.160
And finally - finally! - I get the
chance to pay off the mortgage

28:57.200 --> 28:59.120
on the workshop and free us both.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.720
You killed a man for that?

29:01.760 --> 29:03.599
I'll turn you in myself!

29:03.600 --> 29:05.280
I didn't kill him!

29:05.320 --> 29:07.879
I was protecting him!

29:07.880 --> 29:09.960
And now I have to save myself.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.839
John, no.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.240
Do not come after me!

29:22.480 --> 29:23.840
Excuse me.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.200
Ah, World War I trench art.

29:31.240 --> 29:35.479
Popular way of passing the time
between being shot at.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.719
Not particularly valuable in itself,

29:37.720 --> 29:40.560
but it's an interesting design
and I do collect such pieces.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.520
I could offer you...
15 shillings?

29:43.560 --> 29:45.600
You know very well
it's worth more than that.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.040
£300 more, in fact.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.320
And I am not the only person around
here that you have tried to cheat.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.880
If I could have a penny for
every person who's brought me

29:55.920 --> 29:58.600
the purported "early work"
of a famous artist.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.960
Tell me, have you even
heard of provenance?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.880
Of course I have!

30:02.920 --> 30:05.120
It's in the south of France.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.759
Provenance means a chain of title,

30:08.760 --> 30:11.600
proving that a piece is by
who it claims to be by.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.880
Without proof, a work like this
could be by anyone.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.120
Which, in this case, it probably is.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.320
If you observe...

30:19.360 --> 30:22.360
perfectly reasonable detail
on the front...

30:22.400 --> 30:24.279
Hello, Freya. Hello, Evie.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.840
Hello, Father Brown.

30:25.880 --> 30:28.560
Wherever have you two been?

30:28.600 --> 30:32.519
Penelope, you need to make enquiries
about that man immediately!

30:32.520 --> 30:37.200
What man? He has been swindling
people right, left and centre.

30:37.240 --> 30:40.199
Am I right in thinking
you're referring to

30:40.200 --> 30:44.320
our esteemed antiques expert,
Wynford Collins? Yes, your guest!

30:44.360 --> 30:49.000
And that you have borrowed
our treasured oil lamp

30:49.040 --> 30:51.720
to solicit a valuation.

30:51.760 --> 30:56.200
Well, I didn't think you'd mind,
seeing as criminality was involved.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.400
Well?

31:01.440 --> 31:03.719
He actually tried to cheat me.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.880
He made out that your oil lamp
wasn't by Robert Harper at all,

31:07.920 --> 31:11.799
as if Robert hadn't given it to you
with his own hand.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.000
But no, Mr Collins said there was
an insignia at the back.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.400
Post Office Rifles.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.080
And he was certain of it
because he had started out

31:20.120 --> 31:24.720
as a Postal Services clerk before
he went into the auction business.

31:24.760 --> 31:29.120
And he knew that no Robert Harper
had ever served in that corps.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.439
Then he had the temerity to say

31:32.440 --> 31:36.080
I should check my facts!

31:36.120 --> 31:37.960
Yes.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.280
Postal Service.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.000
I'm sorry, we're closed.
This won't take long.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.880
Very well.

31:52.920 --> 31:56.200
Have you ever been in Tanganyika?

31:56.240 --> 31:57.600
What's this about?

32:00.440 --> 32:04.440
Do you know anything about this
party at the governor's residence?

32:04.480 --> 32:08.039
I've never been to...
whatever country that was,

32:08.040 --> 32:09.920
let alone any party there.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.280
I thought so.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.920
Now, if you'll excuse me.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.640
Turn yourself in!

32:16.680 --> 32:18.960
He's a thief and a liar!

32:19.000 --> 32:21.800
And if the law won't force the truth
from him, then I will!

32:21.840 --> 32:26.800
Father, if you let him
get away, they'll hang me.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.520
You need to tell me the truth.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.040
I've seen your engravings.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.960
You and Mr Aldous Kemp used to work
for the East African Postal Service

32:57.000 --> 32:59.200
in Tanganyika, didn't you?

32:59.240 --> 33:01.240
And you engrave stamps.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.600
Among them the Tanganyika Green
which is worth, well,

33:05.640 --> 33:09.160
enough for one - or two men -

33:09.200 --> 33:11.560
to live comfortably
for the rest of their lives.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.040
How do you...?

33:15.080 --> 33:17.480
Was it yours or Mr Kemp's idea?

33:20.160 --> 33:21.360
It was all for Grace.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.000
He'd never have done it for himself.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.320
He was a clever man,
but his family had modest means.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.960
It was hard for him,
watching lesser men rise above him

33:36.000 --> 33:38.200
because of their money
and connections.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.160
He didn't want to fail her.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.800
But she was set on medical school.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.640
That's the only one?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.560
I've changed the plate
so it's up the right way now.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.200
How much do you think they're worth?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.880
Depends on the collectors.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.120
So...

34:11.840 --> 34:13.280
..four for us.

34:25.560 --> 34:26.639
Good job.

34:29.639 --> 34:33.279
'He said we should wait a year. Sell
them through a provincial dealer

34:33.280 --> 34:35.080
'back here to avoid attention.'

34:36.920 --> 34:40.960
As agreed, Mr Kemp
returns to England,

34:41.000 --> 34:45.040
and after hearing about thefts
at the inn,

34:45.080 --> 34:48.639
you left your gun there
for him to protect himself.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.560
But then something went wrong.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.639
He saw Wynford. At the inn.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.359
And Mr Wynford Collins
recognised Mr Kemp,

35:02.360 --> 35:05.160
because they used to work together
at the British Postal Office.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.439
So...

35:08.440 --> 35:11.039
he cancelled the planned meeting

35:11.040 --> 35:14.119
and came to tell you that
the sale was off.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.159
Listen, their valuer knows
I work for the Postal Service,

35:17.160 --> 35:19.560
so if he catches even
a whiff of that stamp,

35:19.600 --> 35:22.200
he'll know what we've done.
It'll be worthless to us.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.279
Let me sell it to him, then.
Well, that's not suspicious,

35:25.280 --> 35:28.000
me cancelling our meeting one day,
and you offering him

35:28.040 --> 35:31.479
rare stamps the next(!)
No, we'll have to wait.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.600
Find another buyer. I can't wait any
longer. They're going to take this

35:34.640 --> 35:36.600
place unless we pay the arrears
this month.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.440
You're not the only one
letting down someone you love.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.480
Clearly you don't love her enough!

35:45.400 --> 35:47.320
But you went to Mr Collins, anyway.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.080
What sort of stamp is it?

35:55.560 --> 35:57.040
A Tanganyika Green.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.000
Obviously, I'd need to see it.

36:02.040 --> 36:05.079
If it's damaged, that may diminish
the value significantly.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.160
But if you'd like to bring it
along tomorrow,

36:07.200 --> 36:09.480
I'd be happy to examine it.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.439
Ten o'clock?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.000
Ten o'clock.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.799
I couldn't find the stamps.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.400
Codswallop.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.840
So you just sat at the bar

36:42.880 --> 36:46.080
for the rest of the night
while some mystery thief

36:46.120 --> 36:50.240
happened to hear about the stamps
and drug Kemp to get them?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.400
It's the truth.

36:52.440 --> 36:56.880
But there was someone there
who knew about the stamps

36:56.920 --> 36:59.480
and wanted to take them
for themselves.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.400
And knew that his victims
could not complain

37:02.440 --> 37:05.200
for fear of revealing their fraud.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.519
Mr Collins?!

37:12.520 --> 37:15.720
You've gone off the deep end
this time, Padre.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.040
The innkeeper told you that the room
next to Mr Kemp's was empty,

37:21.080 --> 37:25.119
but that was exactly
when Mr Collins was packing,

37:25.120 --> 37:29.360
and when Grace Kemp left her
father's drink outside his door.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.360
Nice try, Padre.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.640
But no sleeping pill I know
would've had time to work

37:34.680 --> 37:36.680
before he'd left for Montague,

37:36.720 --> 37:39.720
where, I have it on good authority,

37:39.760 --> 37:41.719
he stayed that night.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.200
And where Miss Windermere's
car suffered

37:44.240 --> 37:46.599
a mysterious loss of petrol

37:46.600 --> 37:48.040
that night.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.520
Thank you so much for waiting
till now to share this

37:53.560 --> 37:55.560
He'll be miles away.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.440
Inspector, I think
his getaway vehicle is, uh...

38:01.280 --> 38:03.319
..unreliable.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.759
They must have emptied the whole
tank last night, damn them!

38:07.760 --> 38:10.000
Only a woman wouldn't carry
any spare.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.720
There's a garage about
half a mile down the road.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.400
Whatever does he want?

38:23.320 --> 38:25.400
I believe he's coming
for your confession.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.320
Is this some sort of practical joke?

38:29.920 --> 38:31.120
I assure you not.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.960
I urge you to confess
to the murder of Aldous Kemp

38:38.000 --> 38:41.079
and save an innocent young man
from the gallows.

38:41.080 --> 38:45.559
Ah, the drunk with the shotgun.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.560
Provincial fairs. There's always
one disappointed customer

38:48.600 --> 38:50.879
who's spent too long
in the cider tent.

38:50.880 --> 38:54.880
Although I've never been
accused of murder before!

38:57.720 --> 39:02.200
The Tanganyika Green
is a very valuable stamp.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.519
I'd expect any dealer
worth his salt to recognise it.

39:06.520 --> 39:12.319
But when I showed you four
on an envelope, you said nothing.

39:12.320 --> 39:17.600
Because you are the one who broke
into the room to steal the stamps,

39:17.640 --> 39:20.480
and killed Aldous Kemp.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.600
I think your friend's
been in the cider tent, too.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.760
I'll get the garage to send someone.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.200
Sorry, Father.
I don't think I've dented it.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.439
Always happy to help, Inspector.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.319
I-I didn't kill him!

39:47.320 --> 39:49.679
Oh? So what did you do, then?

39:49.680 --> 39:51.760
It was an accident!

39:51.800 --> 39:53.880
They brought me the stamp.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.239
A postal services officer
and an engraver.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.520
Of course I realised
what they'd done.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.680
I didn't plan to take it, but...

40:00.720 --> 40:03.120
I've put it outside.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.360
Usiku mwema.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.000
Lala salama.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.280
What can I say?

40:10.320 --> 40:12.080
All men have their weaknesses.

40:30.160 --> 40:33.000
You waited for the sleeping pills
to take effect....

40:34.440 --> 40:37.279
..and then you returned
in Miss Windermere's car

40:37.280 --> 40:38.680
to fetch the stamps.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.080
He should have been asleep.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.880
What are you doing?

40:53.120 --> 40:55.599
Let's keep this simple.
I know what you did.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.439
So you give me the stamps or I tell
every auction house in the country

40:58.440 --> 41:00.520
and nobody makes any money.
Get out!

41:04.200 --> 41:07.120
They're not there.
I haven't got them.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.120
He was alive when I left him.
That's all I know.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.759
But you did not know
that your sleeping pills

41:38.760 --> 41:41.240
were reacting
with his malaria drugs.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.319
And that would kill him.
You see, it was an accident.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.760
It might not be murder,

41:45.800 --> 41:48.560
but you're still looking at
manslaughter, in my book.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.679
And worse

41:53.680 --> 41:55.879
for his unrepentant soul, I fear.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.640
I don't have them! The priest does!

41:57.680 --> 41:59.720
Yes, he's a big stamp collector.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.040
Your inheritance.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.600
I can't take them.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.680
Those tiny scraps of paper are
the difference between my father

42:22.720 --> 42:24.720
being dead or alive.

42:26.760 --> 42:30.200
Or the difference between
a life fulfilled

42:30.240 --> 42:32.719
and a life frustrated.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.559
Grace, take them.

42:35.560 --> 42:40.640
The patients whose lives
you will save will be glad you did.

42:40.680 --> 42:43.600
But she can't sell them!
I mean, that would be fraud!

42:43.640 --> 42:47.199
Nonsense! They're genuine stamps.
And I could introduce you

42:47.200 --> 42:49.640
to genuine buyers.
If that's what you'd like?

42:52.760 --> 42:57.000
I never imagined I'd be persuaded
of anything by a Catholic priest.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.880
But there's something
I must do first.

42:59.920 --> 43:03.080
I always had my father's
support for my ambitions.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.960
He's come this far with none.

43:13.440 --> 43:18.400
The Lord sets a hard road for those
he entrusts with a talent.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.319
But a hard road

43:22.320 --> 43:24.240
is easier with a friend.

43:26.280 --> 43:29.920
It must be nice,
to excel at something.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.560
You do excel at something -

43:32.600 --> 43:35.120
getting into trouble. Just like him.
