WEBVTT

03:11.729 --> 03:13.597
Everything changes.

03:13.632 --> 03:15.566
It's a fact.

03:15.601 --> 03:19.438
Everything is destined
to undergo a change.

03:19.473 --> 03:24.773
We live to take care of our
children, to protect them,

03:24.808 --> 03:27.644
to make sure that they're well.

03:27.679 --> 03:30.878
We live every day with the
fear that unexpected events

03:30.913 --> 03:33.881
can change our life.

03:33.916 --> 03:38.292
But time, it doesn't stop.

03:38.327 --> 03:40.459
It doesn't wait.

03:40.494 --> 03:42.923
You can't control it.

03:42.958 --> 03:47.961
It's life, a breath, a moment.

04:10.623 --> 04:11.919
Laura?

04:11.954 --> 04:12.788
We better head down.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.021
It's almost dark.

04:15.056 --> 04:15.588
Go ahead.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.695
I'll catch up with you.

04:18.730 --> 04:20.565
I'm heading down with the guys.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.863
Call me when you're on the road.

04:21.898 --> 04:25.438
I'll call you when I'm
back at the lab, Adam.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.704
Oh, leave everything in the car.

04:27.739 --> 04:31.576
Next week, when we get back,
we need to update and analyze

04:31.611 --> 04:33.380
all the data we need to send.

04:33.415 --> 04:35.481
Get some rest over
the next seven days.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.648
We deserve it, right?

04:37.683 --> 04:39.518
I'm not coming back.

04:39.553 --> 04:41.113
Everything's in my notes.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.917
Your tour is over?

04:42.952 --> 04:44.017
Time flies.

04:44.052 --> 04:44.688
I'll call you.

04:44.723 --> 04:45.326
Be careful.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.397
My name is Laura--

04:50.432 --> 04:51.959
Laura Winslet.

04:51.994 --> 04:53.928
I'm a geologist.

04:53.963 --> 04:57.932
I study the seismic
activity of volcanoes.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.836
When I was a kid, while
I was at school on a day

05:00.871 --> 05:05.071
just like any other, an
earthquake rocked our desks.

05:05.106 --> 05:07.645
We looked at each
other, terrified.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.549
Something totally unexpected
had happened from one moment

05:10.584 --> 05:12.584
to another.

05:12.619 --> 05:17.490
Volcanoes, the Earth, time--

05:17.525 --> 05:20.625
life is just one of those things
that you just can't predict.

05:45.487 --> 05:47.113
Are you still there?

05:47.148 --> 05:49.181
Adam, I'm almost home.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.920
What do you want, to hear my
dogs barking or something?

05:51.955 --> 05:54.153
I just need to
park and I'm there.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.087
All right.

05:55.123 --> 05:58.597
I'm taking my son to
the falls tomorrow.

05:58.632 --> 06:04.097
And if you can get in touch
with me or if you need anything,

06:04.132 --> 06:05.505
just leave me a message.

06:05.540 --> 06:05.934
OK.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.872
Listen, you want to--

06:09.907 --> 06:16.043
go-- jeez.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.210
Mommy, when are you coming?

06:18.245 --> 06:22.148
Grandpa says you're
never coming.

06:22.183 --> 06:24.018
Yeah, you've got
to be here, mommy.

06:24.053 --> 06:26.592
Time for a party.

06:26.627 --> 06:27.087
Press off.

06:34.635 --> 06:35.029
Shit.

09:25.234 --> 09:29.775
The worst never ends.

09:29.810 --> 09:34.780
I've heard it said again
and again, but it's a lie.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.683
There is an end.

09:36.718 --> 09:40.148
And it starts when
you hit the bottom.

09:40.183 --> 09:43.283
I had just fallen.

09:43.318 --> 09:44.889
If you're so sure
that I'm not going

09:44.924 --> 09:47.221
to die because I'm the one
telling you this story,

09:47.256 --> 09:50.994
that's a pretty big assumption.

09:51.029 --> 09:55.229
We'll anticipate what
will happen next.

09:55.264 --> 09:58.034
I had been working
there for 30 days.

09:58.069 --> 10:01.202
I was sure of where I was going.

10:01.237 --> 10:03.908
Nothing could surprise me.

10:03.943 --> 10:05.976
But now I'm here.

10:06.011 --> 10:09.243
I'd made the same mistake again.

10:09.278 --> 10:16.250
I'm sure about tomorrow, but
now what have you fallen into?

10:18.859 --> 10:19.957
Nothing but darkness.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.114
I know what you're thinking--

13:30.149 --> 13:34.217
scream, look for
help, do something.

13:34.252 --> 13:37.418
I could yell, cry,
get all worked up--

13:37.453 --> 13:39.926
for what?

13:39.961 --> 13:41.488
I just fell in here
a few minutes ago,

13:41.523 --> 13:45.096
but I am already certain
that there's no way out.

15:47.715 --> 15:51.057
As with all true
beginnings, everything

15:51.092 --> 15:53.224
starts with you trying
to reach something.

15:56.295 --> 15:59.362
I already know what I won't
find in that backpack--

15:59.397 --> 16:03.729
no ladder, no rope,
nothing that I can

16:03.764 --> 16:05.632
use to pull myself out of here.

17:57.746 --> 18:02.782
A half a liter of water, a
pack of gum, nothing to eat.

18:05.424 --> 18:07.688
The others will be
back in a week--

18:07.723 --> 18:10.691
seven days and eight nights.

18:10.726 --> 18:14.332
I skipped lunch today, damn it.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.829
What kind of shitty situation
did I get myself into?

21:59.658 --> 22:02.461
Mommy, wake up.

22:02.496 --> 22:03.429
Wake up.

22:06.093 --> 22:07.631
Wake up.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.033
Mommy, wake up.

22:47.904 --> 22:52.071
Oh, oh, hi.

22:55.648 --> 22:58.044
Mommy, you remember
what day is today.

23:00.950 --> 23:03.984
It is your birthday.

23:04.019 --> 23:07.053
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

23:07.088 --> 23:07.691
Oh--

23:12.995 --> 23:14.027
Uh-huh.

23:14.062 --> 23:17.569
It's at our house.

23:25.777 --> 23:30.912
That's lovely, fantastic.

23:36.150 --> 23:39.250
Adam called a few times.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.625
I want you to call him back.

23:47.931 --> 23:50.030
You're going up to
the volcano, too?

23:50.065 --> 23:51.702
Yeah, I just--

23:51.737 --> 23:54.639
I have to get some
more soil samples.

23:54.674 --> 23:57.202
I understand, I understand.

24:02.176 --> 24:07.014
Hey, that's a
beautiful palm tree.

24:07.049 --> 24:09.280
And all the flowers
outside the house--

24:09.315 --> 24:10.820
that's beautiful.

24:10.855 --> 24:12.624
You're so clever.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.692
I want to color some in.

24:14.727 --> 24:15.495
Lovely windows--

24:20.898 --> 24:22.227
Just step up here.

24:22.262 --> 24:25.065
You don't-- you can put
my hand right there.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.869
All right.

24:26.904 --> 24:29.267
Here we go.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.137
OK.

24:31.172 --> 24:33.271
OK.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.911
Are you sure you want to wait
until later to open it with me?

24:35.946 --> 24:36.578
Yes.

24:36.614 --> 24:38.749
Don't be late for the party.

24:38.784 --> 24:42.016
I won't be-- can't, I promise.

24:46.022 --> 24:47.857
I'm disappointed, Laura.

24:47.892 --> 24:48.990
That's enough, Dad.

24:51.599 --> 24:53.060
If you can't get
through on my phone,

24:53.095 --> 24:55.865
just send me voice messages.

24:55.900 --> 24:59.671
OK, be careful.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.206
We'll going to have a party.

25:07.241 --> 25:08.339
Yay!

25:08.374 --> 25:08.977
Yay!

25:15.854 --> 25:17.018
Laura, about last night.

25:23.224 --> 25:24.762
You don't have to say anything.

25:24.797 --> 25:27.930
You were drinking.

25:27.965 --> 25:31.032
You weren't yourself.

25:31.067 --> 25:37.973
I know I had a couple of drinks,
but everything I said is true.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.543
I feel the same.

25:45.411 --> 25:48.016
Adam, you're my best friend.

25:48.051 --> 25:51.052
We work together.

25:51.087 --> 25:55.320
What happened between us
doesn't change anything.

25:55.355 --> 25:57.058
We're just friends.

26:02.065 --> 26:06.133
You know it's more than that.

26:06.168 --> 26:09.301
I mean, whatever
we do, I feel good.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.204
I want to leave Emily.

26:11.239 --> 26:14.042
I don't love her anymore.

26:14.077 --> 26:15.043
And--

26:44.305 --> 26:46.943
Mommy, when are you?

26:46.978 --> 26:50.683
Grandpa says you're coming.

26:50.718 --> 26:52.344
Yeah, you're got
to be here, mommy.

26:52.379 --> 26:54.346
Time for a party.

26:54.381 --> 26:57.822
Press off.

26:57.857 --> 26:59.219
Sweetheart, I'll be home soon.

28:21.468 --> 28:23.776
Have you ever dreamed
your memories?

28:23.811 --> 28:24.844
I do it all the time.

28:24.879 --> 28:30.475
It's amazing how real they
seem, but I'm still here

28:30.510 --> 28:31.443
in this shit hole.

28:37.286 --> 28:40.221
Mommy, when are you coming?

28:40.256 --> 28:44.390
Grandpa says you're coming.

28:44.425 --> 28:46.293
Yeah, you're got
to be here, mommy.

28:46.328 --> 28:48.999
Time for a party.

28:49.034 --> 28:50.803
Press off.

28:50.838 --> 28:52.200
I told you a lie, Christine.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.222
I get it.

31:26.257 --> 31:27.960
It doesn't seem
that solid, but it's

31:27.995 --> 31:30.358
the best idea I could think up.

34:57.534 --> 35:07.542
Yes, yes, yes-- no, no, no.

35:07.577 --> 35:09.874
On to my phone,
holding the rope--

35:09.909 --> 35:10.908
help me!

35:23.692 --> 35:26.528
Fuck.

35:26.563 --> 35:27.166
Shit.

35:51.291 --> 35:51.685
Help!

36:08.968 --> 36:09.571
Snakes.

38:44.189 --> 38:49.159
Dad, I don't remember what I
said the last time I saw you.

38:49.194 --> 38:53.702
Sometimes we don't recognize
the really important moments.

38:53.737 --> 38:55.440
They slip away
without knowing we

38:55.475 --> 39:01.941
won't have another opportunity
to go back and say, I'm sorry,

39:01.976 --> 39:05.076
I love you, and thanks.

39:07.916 --> 39:10.785
When I was a little girl,
you always found an answer

39:10.820 --> 39:12.919
to all my questions--

39:12.954 --> 39:16.461
or at least I thought you did.

39:16.496 --> 39:20.696
You probably didn't, but
I couldn't understand it.

39:20.731 --> 39:22.863
I thought that as
a parent, I would

39:22.898 --> 39:25.536
have an answer to everything.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.769
I'd like to think so.

39:27.804 --> 39:32.906
Now that I am a parent,
I know that's not true.

39:32.941 --> 39:37.977
There are too many questions,
and new ones never stop coming.

41:06.034 --> 41:08.672
What a way to go--

41:08.707 --> 41:10.839
I never would have guessed it.

41:10.874 --> 41:17.912
The silence, the heat, the cold
at the heart of the volcano--

41:17.947 --> 41:21.146
ending my days in
total agony down here.

41:21.181 --> 41:28.021
I wouldn't wish it upon anybody,
but it's happening to me.

41:28.056 --> 41:30.155
It's like one of those
stories you see in a film

41:30.190 --> 41:33.862
or you hear people talk about.

41:33.897 --> 41:36.799
How long can her body
keep going without eating,

41:36.834 --> 41:40.132
without drinking, in
conditions like this?

41:47.108 --> 41:49.614
I may end up
drinking my pee soon,

41:49.649 --> 41:53.651
because my water is
going to run out.

41:53.686 --> 41:56.214
Yeah, it's something I've
heard of plenty of times,

41:56.249 --> 41:59.184
but I would never
think of doing it.

43:49.901 --> 43:53.199
Hey Laura, it's me.

43:53.234 --> 43:54.904
Call me-- bye.

45:20.959 --> 45:23.322
I'm sorry I'm late, princess.

45:23.357 --> 45:25.159
OK, mommy.

45:25.194 --> 45:27.964
I'm going to go help
Grandpa with the cake, OK?

45:27.999 --> 45:29.394
I want to stay with you.

45:29.429 --> 45:30.065
Oh, I know.

45:30.100 --> 45:31.429
Me too, sweetie.

45:31.464 --> 45:32.697
You know what?

45:32.732 --> 45:35.400
Why don't you go play with the
others, and I'll be right back.

45:35.435 --> 45:36.467
OK, Mommy.

45:36.502 --> 45:37.105
OK.

46:26.453 --> 46:27.892
Thank you, dad.

46:55.053 --> 46:57.548
Christine, Christine,
come here--

46:57.583 --> 46:59.616
it's OK, it's OK.

46:59.651 --> 47:00.518
Come here, breathe.

47:00.553 --> 47:02.190
Mommy's here, OK?

47:02.225 --> 47:03.191
Breathe.

47:03.226 --> 47:09.197
One, two, three, breathe.

47:09.232 --> 47:15.137
One, two, three, breathe.

47:15.172 --> 47:19.108
One, two, three, breathe.

47:22.113 --> 47:26.115
One, two, three, breathe.

48:44.063 --> 48:48.593
Mommy, finish-- I'm better
now, Mommy, all better.

48:48.628 --> 48:50.496
You are better.

48:50.531 --> 48:52.267
Every night, you
and mommy are going

48:52.302 --> 48:55.171
to do these exercises so
we can get better together.

48:55.206 --> 48:57.041
OK?

48:57.076 --> 48:59.274
Mommy, we never opened the gift.

48:59.309 --> 49:02.145
Oh, you're right, honey.

49:02.180 --> 49:02.739
Let's open it.

49:17.558 --> 49:18.656
Who is this?

49:18.691 --> 49:19.998
What's her name?

49:22.596 --> 49:27.170
She is a geologist,
just like mommy,

49:27.205 --> 49:32.043
and her name is Clarissa.

49:32.078 --> 49:33.407
Clarissa.

49:33.442 --> 49:35.178
Yeah.

49:35.213 --> 49:37.114
She goes to study the soil.

49:37.149 --> 49:39.512
And she comes right
back home, because she

49:39.547 --> 49:41.679
knows her daughter
is waiting for her.

51:27.358 --> 51:28.621
It's all right.

51:32.198 --> 51:33.197
It's like Christine.

51:37.962 --> 51:40.600
Mommy's not like Clarissa.

51:40.635 --> 51:42.173
Mommy's always late.

51:46.344 --> 51:53.514
Why can't-- your mommy's
not a good mother.

52:13.305 --> 52:19.243
Oh, god-- help!

52:22.776 --> 52:23.511
Help me!

52:25.878 --> 52:26.481
Help!

52:29.882 --> 52:31.222
Is anybody there!

52:33.952 --> 52:34.654
Help me out.

52:34.689 --> 52:35.721
I'm down here!

54:16.857 --> 54:21.728
One, two, three, breathe.

54:21.763 --> 54:26.997
One, two, three, breathe.

54:27.032 --> 54:31.903
One, two, three, breathe.

54:31.938 --> 54:36.776
One, two, three, breathe.

54:36.811 --> 54:40.582
One, two, three, breathe.

54:43.785 --> 54:51.560
Breathe-- one, two,
three, breathe.

54:51.595 --> 54:53.529
One--

55:54.988 --> 55:55.822
It's not the heat.

55:58.662 --> 56:01.729
It's not the hunger.

56:01.764 --> 56:04.897
It's the silence.

56:04.932 --> 56:08.439
The silence is destroying
my eardrums, my mind.

56:10.971 --> 56:14.071
The black rocks
all around me, all

56:14.106 --> 56:20.176
of my screams, all of my
pleas for help are sucked up.

56:20.211 --> 56:24.455
And I'm stuck here alone,
and nobody will ever find me.

56:26.855 --> 56:28.789
Nobody will ever know
what's happening to me.

56:31.662 --> 56:35.499
They'll think I ran
off because of my life.

56:35.534 --> 56:38.964
Adam didn't get the message.

56:38.999 --> 56:42.506
No one will find me.

56:42.541 --> 56:46.807
I have to get myself
out of here, but how?

56:56.753 --> 56:58.082
Laura?

59:09.413 --> 59:10.621
Sorry, pal.

59:10.656 --> 59:12.117
You're right.

59:12.152 --> 59:14.856
I'm the one that
barged into your house,

59:14.891 --> 59:15.957
but I didn't mean to.

59:15.992 --> 59:20.389
And if you come close again,
I'll have to kill you.

59:20.424 --> 59:23.161
It's just a question
of survival.

59:23.196 --> 59:24.261
It's nothing personal.

1:00:37.105 --> 1:00:37.804
I'm sorry.

1:00:37.839 --> 1:00:39.303
You caught me at
a bad time, man.

1:00:43.078 --> 1:00:44.275
What is it?

1:00:47.412 --> 1:00:50.721
They're checking the areas.

1:00:50.756 --> 1:00:52.987
It's been three days
without any news.

1:00:57.356 --> 1:00:58.289
I won't go there.

1:01:01.162 --> 1:01:04.999
I'm sorry, but I won't.

1:01:47.978 --> 1:01:49.912
Think of something, Laura.

1:01:49.947 --> 1:01:50.341
Think.

1:01:56.349 --> 1:01:58.954
Look at us.

1:01:58.989 --> 1:02:02.254
We put work before
everything, and now what?

1:02:05.556 --> 1:02:09.492
Now, we're all alone.

1:02:09.527 --> 1:02:10.427
I know.

1:02:18.173 --> 1:02:20.074
I'm a lousy mother.

1:02:25.884 --> 1:02:27.048
What's the point in going on?

1:02:31.857 --> 1:02:34.418
Maybe being down here is the
best thing that could happen.

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:44.395
You're right.

1:02:47.136 --> 1:02:52.975
I should probably just let go.

1:02:55.914 --> 1:02:57.309
Give up hope.

1:03:04.549 --> 1:03:07.957
Do it, Laura.

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:08.551
Do it.

1:03:14.262 --> 1:03:18.330
A demon seen-- no.

1:03:18.365 --> 1:03:22.268
Just my lack of a will to
live telling me what to do.

1:03:22.303 --> 1:03:23.973
That can be sweet--

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:26.437
another way of solving
all your problems.

1:03:26.472 --> 1:03:28.274
Is that what you want, Laura?

1:03:28.309 --> 1:03:32.542
Do you really want to
throw in the towel and die?

1:03:32.577 --> 1:03:33.076
OK, ready?

1:03:33.111 --> 1:03:34.577
We can do it again.

1:03:38.550 --> 1:03:40.517
OK, so--

1:05:44.313 --> 1:05:44.712
Good morning.

1:05:44.747 --> 1:05:47.083
Good morning.

1:05:47.118 --> 1:05:49.448
I'm Nick Winslet, her father.

1:05:49.483 --> 1:05:50.614
When news is there?

1:05:50.649 --> 1:05:53.221
Hey, bud.

1:05:58.129 --> 1:05:59.328
Unfortunately, no.

1:05:59.364 --> 1:06:02.098
We are doing everything we can,
but that area is very large.

1:06:02.133 --> 1:06:04.793
How long can she survive?

1:06:07.402 --> 1:06:09.798
We're putting all
efforts in the search.

1:06:27.785 --> 1:06:29.323
Where are you, Laura?

1:06:34.363 --> 1:06:36.693
Where-- where are you?

1:07:31.222 --> 1:07:34.190
My leg doesn't hurt as bad.

1:07:34.225 --> 1:07:37.259
I don't know if
that's a good thing.

1:07:37.294 --> 1:07:38.524
I'm hungry.

1:07:38.559 --> 1:07:41.824
I'm trying not to drink,
but I'm so thirsty.

1:07:41.859 --> 1:07:45.465
I have two swallows of water
left, and then that's it.

1:08:31.711 --> 1:08:33.876
I feel so weak.

1:08:33.911 --> 1:08:35.746
I can't make it.

1:08:35.781 --> 1:08:36.912
I just can't.

1:10:14.352 --> 1:10:16.847
Am I really managing
to climb out?

1:10:16.882 --> 1:10:20.851
I'm going to fall and really
hurt myself this time.

1:10:20.886 --> 1:10:22.985
I have no strength left.

1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:26.054
I've never been able to
get where I want to go,

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:28.023
but now I want to get
to that damn backpack

1:10:28.058 --> 1:10:32.599
so I can rest up
there, catch my breath,

1:10:32.634 --> 1:10:34.370
and try and keep climbing.

1:12:55.139 --> 1:12:56.743
Laura, can you hear me?

1:13:05.688 --> 1:13:06.082
Help!

1:13:17.634 --> 1:13:21.097
My leg is broken, I can't move.

1:13:21.132 --> 1:13:26.003
Just relax, I'll pull you out.

1:13:26.038 --> 1:13:29.743
It hurts like hell.

1:13:56.706 --> 1:14:01.236
If you hadn't shown up,
I'd have died down there.

1:14:04.274 --> 1:14:06.516
You saved my life.

1:14:06.551 --> 1:14:07.748
You held out for four days.

1:14:12.953 --> 1:14:16.218
You would have made it
out of there without me.

1:14:16.253 --> 1:14:16.889
You're wrong.

1:14:19.630 --> 1:14:22.125
I would have died down
there if it weren't for you.

1:14:40.013 --> 1:14:43.553
You figured as much, right?

1:14:43.588 --> 1:14:45.148
It's too easy to
dream that someone

1:14:45.183 --> 1:14:48.987
stretches out their hand to you
and pulls you out of trouble.

1:14:49.022 --> 1:14:50.824
It'd be too sweet--

1:14:50.859 --> 1:14:54.256
too easy to fix
everything like that.

1:14:54.291 --> 1:14:57.567
This time, I really
have to drag myself out

1:14:57.602 --> 1:15:00.999
of this mess on my own.

1:15:01.034 --> 1:15:03.232
I don't want to let
you down, Christine,

1:15:03.267 --> 1:15:06.642
but Mommy is really tired.

1:15:06.677 --> 1:15:08.908
I know I disappointed
you, and that you're

1:15:08.943 --> 1:15:12.615
sure Mommy can get out of
here without any problems--

1:15:12.650 --> 1:15:15.145
just like your Clarissa.

1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:19.116
But I don't have any
strength left, my love.

1:15:19.151 --> 1:15:23.087
I just can't make
it out of this hole.

1:15:23.122 --> 1:15:26.123
It's swallowed me up--

1:15:26.158 --> 1:15:27.597
doesn't want to let me go.

1:15:59.059 --> 1:16:08.902
Dad-- Dad, listen, I want
to tell you something.

1:17:04.025 --> 1:17:06.190
Oh, Christine.

1:17:06.225 --> 1:17:07.730
It's Mommy.

1:17:11.197 --> 1:17:14.968
Just so you know,
I won't be late.

1:17:15.003 --> 1:17:16.002
I'm on my way.

1:17:22.505 --> 1:17:34.284
Christine, Christine,
Christine--

1:17:38.125 --> 1:17:40.895
Talking down here, saying
my daughter's name--

1:17:40.930 --> 1:17:43.799
it helps me feel better.

1:17:43.834 --> 1:17:46.769
It makes me feel at peace.

1:17:46.804 --> 1:17:53.204
Dad, Christine-- naming the
people you love most in life

1:17:53.239 --> 1:17:57.274
can bring you relief, it's true.

1:17:57.309 --> 1:18:01.916
In this place,
there's a choked echo.

1:18:01.951 --> 1:18:07.053
For a split second, I can hear
my voice bounce back to me,

1:18:07.088 --> 1:18:09.990
just as if it were
speaking to me.

1:18:10.025 --> 1:18:12.487
I'm not alone.

1:18:12.522 --> 1:18:12.887
Laura--

1:18:12.923 --> 1:18:13.862
With myself.

1:18:16.999 --> 1:18:18.163
Laura, come on.

1:18:22.268 --> 1:18:24.169
Laura, get up.

1:18:24.204 --> 1:18:24.840
Get up.

1:18:27.471 --> 1:18:29.339
Christine's waiting for you.

1:18:49.064 --> 1:18:51.097
You won't disappoint her again.

1:20:36.138 --> 1:20:37.137
¦

1:27:29.881 --> 1:27:30.484
OK.

1:27:54.136 --> 1:27:56.642
Now what?

1:27:56.677 --> 1:27:59.579
Now you're there, halfway
between the bottom

1:27:59.614 --> 1:28:01.009
and the exit.

1:28:01.044 --> 1:28:03.385
Nobody's going to pull you out.

1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:06.355
You have no idea how
to do it yourself.

1:28:06.390 --> 1:28:10.854
I can try to balance
myself, shimmy out.

1:28:10.889 --> 1:28:12.592
My legs won't hold.

1:28:12.627 --> 1:28:15.892
If I fall this time, the
risk of cracking my skull

1:28:15.927 --> 1:28:18.829
and bleeding to death
is almost a sure thing.

1:28:18.864 --> 1:28:20.963
My friend down there
would be happy.

1:28:20.998 --> 1:28:22.536
He'd have food to eat for weeks.

1:28:36.453 --> 1:28:39.850
The sun is covered.

1:28:39.885 --> 1:28:42.523
Don't faint, Laura.

1:28:42.558 --> 1:28:44.558
Don't faint, or you won't
make it back up again.

1:28:49.730 --> 1:28:51.598
I'm exhausted.

1:28:51.633 --> 1:28:53.160
Being up here makes
me feel safer,

1:28:53.195 --> 1:28:56.834
but I have no strength left.

1:28:56.869 --> 1:29:00.739
I'm far away from that snake,
which might be harmless anyway,

1:29:00.774 --> 1:29:03.808
but I've never been
crazy about snakes.

1:29:45.951 --> 1:29:46.884
I have to drink.

1:29:52.023 --> 1:29:59.061
Adam, you're a good man, and
Emily deserves your love.

1:29:59.096 --> 1:30:03.868
It's clear we have something
special between us, I just--

1:30:03.903 --> 1:30:05.100
I don't want to ruin that.

1:30:10.943 --> 1:30:17.178
If you're still in love with
Eric, I'll stop insisting.

1:30:17.213 --> 1:30:18.652
I don't know what else to say.

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:26.495
Adam, we're just friends.

1:30:26.530 --> 1:30:31.797
That's all I need.

1:30:31.832 --> 1:30:34.195
OK, whatever you want.

1:30:40.577 --> 1:30:45.272
This is how Laura Winslet comes
to an end and makes her exit.

1:30:45.307 --> 1:30:52.081
Adam, he's a good man,
he makes me feel good.

1:30:52.116 --> 1:30:54.688
But he's married.

1:30:54.723 --> 1:30:55.920
He's my friend.

1:30:55.955 --> 1:31:00.155
Friendship isn't
love, right, Laura?

1:31:00.190 --> 1:31:03.796
Why am I thinking about him now?

1:31:03.831 --> 1:31:06.128
They say that before you die,
you think of the people that

1:31:06.163 --> 1:31:11.705
are most important to you,
the ones you'll miss the most.

1:31:11.740 --> 1:31:13.542
He's one of them.

1:31:40.769 --> 1:31:42.197
I have to get down from here.

1:31:44.971 --> 1:31:46.234
What time is it?

1:33:34.146 --> 1:33:36.949
No-- no news yet.

1:33:36.984 --> 1:33:39.314
OK, Adam.

1:33:39.349 --> 1:33:41.690
So we'll talk tomorrow?

1:33:41.725 --> 1:33:42.119
I'm sorry.

1:34:34.503 --> 1:34:35.106
Laura!

1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:48.790
I will find you, Laura.

1:34:48.825 --> 1:34:51.188
I will find you.

1:38:15.328 --> 1:38:15.931
Dad?

1:38:34.644 --> 1:38:36.050
I've been calling you nonstop.

1:38:39.154 --> 1:38:40.087
Why don't you answer?

1:38:52.629 --> 1:38:55.201
I'm not going anywhere.

1:40:13.809 --> 1:40:15.842
Perhaps dying in this
hole is a way to end

1:40:15.877 --> 1:40:21.749
the suffering, a predictable
way to end it all.

1:40:21.784 --> 1:40:25.423
But something inside
me says that this

1:40:25.458 --> 1:40:28.624
can't be the last chapter.

1:40:28.659 --> 1:40:31.198
Something tells me that
I have to keep on living.

1:40:35.369 --> 1:40:37.567
Not for my daughter--

1:40:37.602 --> 1:40:39.800
she's gone.

1:40:39.835 --> 1:40:49.117
Not for my father, not
for Adam, for myself.

1:40:49.152 --> 1:40:51.812
I have to do it for myself.

1:40:51.847 --> 1:40:52.379
,

1:40:52.414 --> 1:40:54.419
Mommy when are coming?

1:40:54.454 --> 1:40:58.588
Grandpa says that you're coming.

1:40:58.623 --> 1:41:01.294
Nobody's going to
pull me out of here.

1:41:01.329 --> 1:41:05.496
Only I can do it, if I
really want to do it.

1:41:05.531 --> 1:41:11.799
Only I can find the strength
inside me to fight back.

1:41:11.834 --> 1:41:14.340
I have to live--

1:41:14.375 --> 1:41:16.408
I want to live.

1:43:37.815 --> 1:43:42.015
Healing from a wound that does
not want to heal takes time.

1:43:42.050 --> 1:43:46.327
Healing can be slow, very slow.

1:43:46.362 --> 1:43:50.826
Months can pass,
sometimes even years.

1:43:50.861 --> 1:43:55.369
But in the end, even after
the deepest darkness,

1:43:55.404 --> 1:43:58.306
the sun always rises again.

1:43:58.341 --> 1:44:02.838
And I start to breathe
again, aware that something

1:44:02.873 --> 1:44:05.313
has changed in me--

1:44:05.348 --> 1:44:08.580
completely, forever.
