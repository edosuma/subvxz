WEBVTT

00:13.181 --> 00:14.348
Huh?

00:52.178 --> 00:53.846
Shh.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.314
Mmm!

01:38.015 --> 01:40.351
Are you sure we took
the right turn, Shaggy?

01:40.518 --> 01:44.522
Sure. We took this road
and turned to the right.

01:44.689 --> 01:49.860
No wonder we're lost. You've been
reading the map upside down.

01:51.237 --> 01:55.741
Here's where we are.
At Gold City, the old ghost town.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.035
- Ghost town?
- Ghost town?

01:58.202 --> 02:00.371
What will we do now?

02:13.384 --> 02:14.593
What's that over there?

02:18.556 --> 02:22.101
"Gold City Guest Ranch. Vacancy."

02:22.268 --> 02:24.145
Maybe we can spend the night there.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.647
- There?
- Yes, there.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.441
Uh-uh.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.070
Go ahead. Ring the bell, Shaggy.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.073
Ring-a-ding-ding, coming up.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.327
Huh?

02:39.577 --> 02:41.912
Welcome, kids. Come on in.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.749
I'm Big Ben, owner of this guest ranch.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.751
Do you happen to have any rooms?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.420
Do I? You're my only guests.

02:49.587 --> 02:52.256
Come on in and register
and I'll call old Hank.

02:52.590 --> 02:56.093
Hank. Oh, Hank.
We have some guests.

03:12.610 --> 03:15.196
Hey, Scooby, come here.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.616
Now, this is Hank,
the caretaker here at the ranch.

03:18.783 --> 03:19.825
Pleased to meet you.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.621
Hank, show the guests to their rooms,
like a good feller.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.498
Follow me.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.334
That will be the girls' room...

03:28.501 --> 03:31.796
and you fellers can bunk in this one,
just across the hall.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.006
These sure are nice rooms.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.801
I can't understand
why the place is empty.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.594
It's the miner.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.514
- The miner?
- The who?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.974
The Miner Forty-Niner.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.853
- Forty-Niner?
- Yes, siree.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.816
He came to Gold City in 1849...

03:52.024 --> 03:56.195
and he can't rest until he finds
the last vein of gold.

03:56.529 --> 03:58.155
1849?

03:58.322 --> 04:01.659
Like, wow, that's what
I call an ancient miner.

04:01.826 --> 04:02.993
That's for sure.

04:03.494 --> 04:06.872
And at night,
you can hear the mine moaning...

04:07.039 --> 04:10.918
- calling for the miner.
- Oh-oh. Oh-oh.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.379
But what has he got to do
with the ranch?

04:13.546 --> 04:14.839
I don't know...

04:15.256 --> 04:20.136
but lately, he's been coming up here
and scaring the guests away.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.347
And I'm going away
in the morning myself.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.517
Man, that's the wildest tale
I ever heard.

04:26.851 --> 04:30.187
Ridiculous.
A 100-year-old miner.

04:30.354 --> 04:33.190
Still, something must have
scared off the guests.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.234
Huh?

04:38.696 --> 04:40.531
Gone!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.533
Well, it's still early.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.245
Why don't we go into the ghost town
and take a look around?

04:48.581 --> 04:51.876
Wonder what it's like
on a Saturday night.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.546
Boy, what a spooky old street.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.720
I've seen enough. Let's go back.

05:06.474 --> 05:10.060
Not until we walk around this
ghost town and see what we can find.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.229
Like, I know what we'll find.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.732
- What?
- Ghosts.

05:30.122 --> 05:34.835
Hey, look, Shaggy.
A real old-time Western saloon.

05:35.002 --> 05:39.423
When you said old,
you just weren't, like, kidding.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.929
- Sarsaparilla, bartender.
- Two.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.019
No wonder this place is empty.

05:52.228 --> 05:56.857
You ask for a sarsaparilla,
and all you get is a glass of spider webs.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.859
Spider webs?

06:04.949 --> 06:08.118
- Zoinks, ghosts!
- Ghosts?

06:11.247 --> 06:15.459
It's not a ghost. It's a player piano.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.336
So Who's playing it?

06:17.503 --> 06:19.046
It's automatic.

06:19.255 --> 06:22.550
It must've turned itself on automatically.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.303
Now, come down out of those draperies.

06:28.681 --> 06:31.809
Like, why couldn't you
have been a poodle?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.982
Did you find any clues?

06:38.148 --> 06:40.401
- Not a one.
- Neither did I.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.653
Let's take a look in this old hotel.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.990
Maybe our mysterious miner
rented a room for the night.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.703
- Oh, go on in, Scooby.
- Yikes!

06:55.666 --> 06:59.503
What a creaky, creepy place.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.508
Hey, Scooby, come on.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.598
Oh, wait for me.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.518
It's lucky for you the room's empty.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.186
Let's get back to the others.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.775
It's got me! Help!

07:39.710 --> 07:43.380
It's only a tree branch.
I knew it all the time.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.971
The only place we haven't looked
is the old mine.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.640
And that's all boarded up.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.060
I'm beginning to think there
really isn't an ancient miner.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.853
Well, let's keep moving.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.271
Keep together, now.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.662
Oh-oh.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.794
Hmm?

08:37.685 --> 08:41.397
Zoinks! The miner's chasing Scooby!

08:48.320 --> 08:52.116
Some miner.
It's only a cigar-store Indian.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.623
Oh, Scooby. Quit clowning.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.750
Who's clowning?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.627
Look. It's hollow.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.672
Hey, what's this inside?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.508
It looks like a map of Gold City.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.968
Look how new it is.

09:11.135 --> 09:14.972
What's a new map like that
doing in an old Indian like this?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.890
It's quite simple.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.769
- Somebody was hiding it.
- Maybe these numbers mean something.

09:21.645 --> 09:26.817
Left 10, right 7, left 4, right 23.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.319
Maybe it's directions
to a buried treasure.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.865
Yeah. Like a fortune in buried
chocolate cheeseburgers.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.369
But those directions don't make sense.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.664
- Then they must mean something.
- But what?

09:41.999 --> 09:43.667
I've got it.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.587
I bet it's the combination of a safe.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.507
And there's an old safe
in the lobby of this hotel.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.184
Shaggy, you work on the combination
as I read off the numbers.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.437
Okay, but I need a moment to warm up.

10:06.398 --> 10:11.320
Now, I must have absolute quiet
while I work.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.534
Huh?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.579
- Oh, Shaggy. Shaggy.
- Quiet.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.583
Look, I have the combination.
Just turn the knob to the right.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.377
Well, why didn't you say so?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.757
It's open.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.594
Stop showing off, Scooby.
I knew it was open all the time.

10:36.512 --> 10:39.765
- Like, wow. Get a load of that.
- A secret elevator.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.559
Well, let's see where it goes.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.061
All aboard.

10:44.603 --> 10:48.816
- Come on, Scooby.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.360
Come on, Scooby. You're not chicken.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.950
Would you come with us
for a Scooby snack?

10:58.909 --> 11:03.080
- Hmm? Two?
- Okay. Two it is.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.915
Well, come on.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.468
Scooby-Doo.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.805
Down.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.645
Wow. Look where we've landed.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.355
A mine tunnel.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.941
It must be the old Gold City Mine.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.987
Well, if there is a miner,
this is where we'll find him.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.905
Come on.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.077
It's sure dark in here.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.704
We could use some light.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.291
Hey, I found some candles.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.961
Shaggy, that's dynamite!

11:52.421 --> 11:54.006
Dynamite?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.188
That's strange.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.691
This end of the mine's lit by lanterns.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.485
Yeah, and I wonder who lit them.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.491
Zoinks. You had to ask.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.453
That must be the moan
that Hank was talking about.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.580
I think we better split up...

12:26.747 --> 12:29.207
and try and find where
that moan came from.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.043
I'll go with Daphne and Velma.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.420
- You go with Scooby-Doo.
- Thanks a lot.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.174
And, Shaggy,
if you find anything, holler.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.719
I'm liable to holler
even if I don't find anything.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.902
Yipe!

13:01.573 --> 13:03.825
What are you trying to do, Scooby?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.873
Well, quit the clowning and come on.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.093
Look at all these doors.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.512
Look in one of those,
I'll look in this one.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.305
Right.

13:25.806 --> 13:26.890
Huh?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.476
Oh-oh.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.568
- You gotta be kidding.
- Uh-uh.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.405
I suppose you want me to look.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.448
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.409
That's what I was afraid of.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.209
- It's empty.
- Huh? Empty?

13:56.253 --> 14:00.007
What are you trying to do,
scare me again?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.520
What now?

14:17.858 --> 14:20.027
Boy, what a scaredy-dog.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.446
You still think there's
something in that closet?

14:22.612 --> 14:25.115
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Okay. We'll switch.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.659
You look in this door,
and I'll look in that one.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.872
And there better be something in it.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.960
Oh, no!

14:37.919 --> 14:41.048
Zoinks! It's the Miner Forty-Niner!

14:48.555 --> 14:51.266
Huh. This must be a storeroom.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.227
Careful. Those old floors look weak.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.562
I know. I know.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.106
- Look out!
- Oh!

14:59.483 --> 15:01.276
Are you all right?

15:01.443 --> 15:02.944
Say something.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.618
I'm all right, just covered with flour.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.996
You wait up there. I'll be right up.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.417
We gotta, like, find a place to hide.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.962
Quick, in here.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.798
Zoinks!

15:22.964 --> 15:26.593
A ghost. Let's get out of here.

15:30.013 --> 15:34.810
Whew! We finally got away
from that goony miner.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.856
It's him!

16:15.058 --> 16:17.060
Look out!

16:23.066 --> 16:25.193
Are you guys all right?

16:25.360 --> 16:26.570
Groovy.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.322
Hey, what happened to Daphne?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.074
I fell down in here.

16:31.408 --> 16:35.537
Wouldn't you know it? Danger-prone
Daphne fell into a mineshaft.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.831
- I'II get her.
- You'll get her?

16:37.998 --> 16:39.207
Uh-huh.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.589
It's the Miner Forty-Niner.

16:47.924 --> 16:51.845
Hey, gang. There's a maze of
secret passages down there.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.930
And guess what I saw in that mine.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.599
Yeah. We saw him too.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.311
I guess Hank wasn't kidding
about that ancient miner.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.942
Do you suppose
that's the miner moaning?

17:06.109 --> 17:10.322
Well, like, if I had a face like that,
I'd moan too.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.574
Hey, look.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.035
I found a Clue.

17:15.202 --> 17:19.915
It seems that this wire
leads up to that speaker.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.626
Now things are beginning
to make a little sense.

17:22.834 --> 17:27.797
And I have a hunch what we'll find
at the other end of this wire.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.594
I was right. A tape recorder.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.263
Well, that accounts
for the mysterious moaning.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.724
Hey, look what I found.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.976
Like, jars of chocolate syrup.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.774
Chocolate syrup, nothing.
That's samples of crude oil.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.151
Oil? In a gold mine?

17:48.360 --> 17:52.489
Hey, this mystery is really
getting mysterious.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.408
And what about our mysterious miner?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.370
I've got a hunch he'll show up soon.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.456
Let's borrow this microphone.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.668
And, Shaggy, we'll need you too.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.150
Listen to that Shaggy go.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.695
And Scooby's great at being a train.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.673
Got him.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.135
Oh, no. Scooby can't stop.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.522
Scooby went right through the shack.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.859
- He's caught him.
- I hope.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.195
Hey, that's gotta be the miner.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.655
But where's Scooby?

19:16.197 --> 19:18.825
Help!

19:25.165 --> 19:28.168
- Huh?
- Look, stilts.

19:28.376 --> 19:31.755
Shaggy's right. He is wearing stilts.

19:32.255 --> 19:35.592
Then this can only be one person.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.386
- Hank.
- Hank?

19:39.095 --> 19:42.223
Oh, dagnabit.

19:43.975 --> 19:47.354
So it was old Hank
who was scaring off my guests.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.481
To force you out of business.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.526
That way, he could buy the guest ranch,
the ghost town-

19:53.693 --> 19:56.780
And, like, the mine for almost nothing.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.949
Then there must still be gold
in that old mine.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.911
Not gold. Black gold.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.705
- You mean oil?
- Like, right.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.504
But how did Hank know about the oil?

20:12.754 --> 20:17.967
He accidentally found the secret
mine entrance in the old hotel safe.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.304
And instead of gold, he found oil.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.432
He had the exact location laid
out on a map.

20:24.599 --> 20:29.270
Then he, like, hid the map in the
cigar-store Indian for safekeeping.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.148
Too bad. We could have been partners.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.609
Now, instead of being rich,
he's in jail.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.113
Hey, like, what happened to Scooby?

20:38.613 --> 20:40.532
There he is.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.536
Scooby, look out for that gopher hole.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.914
Whoa... Whoa... Whoa...

20:53.461 --> 20:55.338
Scooby-Doo!

20:55.547 --> 20:57.674
One of those apples better be for me.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.818
Huh?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.106
Shh.
