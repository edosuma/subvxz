38:25.738 --> 38:29.132
UM, YEAH. YEAH.
UH, I'M SORRY.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.570
CAN WE GIVE JENN

38:31.613 --> 38:34.312
SPENCER: OF COURSE.
CARTER: SPENCER.

38:34.355 --> 38:35.791
CAN I HAVE A WORD?

38:35.835 --> 38:38.533
ACTUALLY, WE WERE
JUST HEADING OUT.

38:38.577 --> 38:39.578
NO, IT'S OK.
GO AHEAD.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.840
WE'LL WAIT
IN THE CAR.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.325
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

38:48.369 --> 38:49.936
JORDAN. HI.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.633
YOU LEFT WITHOUT
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.069
UH, YEAH. I--I GOTTA

38:53.113 --> 38:54.636
FINISH THIS TRACK MIX
FOR A MEETING TOMORROW.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.116
SO, THERE'S
NO CHANCE OF ME

38:56.159 --> 38:57.857
TALKING YOU INTO
GETTING SOME ROSCOE'S?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.206
JORDAN: IT'S MY TREAT.
LAYLA: THANKS. I CAN'T.

38:59.249 --> 39:00.512
I REALLY GOTTA
FINISH THIS.

39:00.555 --> 39:01.861
YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE
ALL GOOD HERE ALONE?

39:01.904 --> 39:03.645
YEAH. I'M GOOD.
BESIDES, I'M NOT ALONE.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.821
JORDAN: YOU'RE NOT?
CLAY: OH, HEY, MAN.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.693
OH, MY BAD.
I WOULD'VE GOT YOU
SOME FOOD, TOO,

39:07.736 --> 39:08.911
IF I'D KNOWN
YOU WERE HERE.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.391
AH, IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.697
UM, I'M ACTUALLY
JUST ON THE WAY OUT.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.090
LAYLA: THANK YOU.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.484
UM, GOOD LUCK WITH

39:20.009 --> 39:21.881
CLAY: LET'S DO THIS.
LAYLA: YEAH.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.668
APPARENTLY, WHEN
BEVERLY HAD THE FLOOD,

39:26.712 --> 39:28.409
UH, THE
CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY

39:28.453 --> 39:29.889
WAS ALSO STOLEN.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.847
AND OUR WI-FI SERVER
DETECTED YOUR PHONE THERE

39:31.891 --> 39:34.372
TONIGHT RIGHT AROUND
THE SAME TIME

39:34.415 --> 39:36.025
THE TROPHY
MAGICALLY REAPPEARED.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.418
CARE TO EXPLAIN HOW
YOU FIT INTO THIS?

39:37.462 --> 39:38.724
AND WHO ELSE
WAS WITH YOU?

39:40.203 --> 39:42.118
I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING FUN FOR THE TEAM.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.557
IT WAS A SENIOR YEAR PRANK.
I'M SORRY.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.167
YOU AND THE
TEAM, RIGHT?

39:48.734 --> 39:51.867
UM...NO, IT WAS JUST ME.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.871
LOOK, THE SPRINKLERS GOING OFF
WAS A COMPLETE ACCIDENT,

39:55.915 --> 39:58.439
BUT I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ALL OF IT.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.049
SPENCER, WE ALL
KNOW THAT

40:00.093 --> 40:02.400
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH STEALING THAT TROPHY.

40:02.443 --> 40:03.662
PUTTING IT BACK,
MAYBE, BUT

40:03.705 --> 40:05.577
YOU CAN TELL
THE TRUTH, SON.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.057
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
YOU SHOULD KNOW THE SCHOOL HAS

40:08.101 --> 40:10.973
ZERO TOLERANCE
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.718
SPENCER: I WAS ALONE.
BILLY: SPENCER.

40:16.762 --> 40:17.937
ARE YOU REALLY
WILLING TO GIVE UP

40:17.980 --> 40:19.417
EVERYTHING FOR
YOUR TEAM?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.593
YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS MEANS EXPULSION.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.465
YOU GUYS GET HOME SAFE.

40:26.075 --> 40:30.950
AHH. DID WE DO THAT
OR WHAT, BABY GIRL? MM!

40:30.993 --> 40:32.952
NOW, HOW DO I GET
THIS MESS OFF MY FACE?

40:32.995 --> 40:35.345
TIME, DAD. HA!
JUST TIME.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.478
[CHUCKLES]
YOUR AUNTIE COOP LOVED

40:37.522 --> 40:39.349
ALL THE PICTURES
I SENT TO HER.

40:39.393 --> 40:40.742
SHE SAID THAT
YOU LOOKED LIKE

40:40.786 --> 40:44.485
YOU WERE READY TO REIGN
YOUR OWN KINGDOM.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.229
PATIENCE SAID
AUNTIE COOP WILL DO

40:49.272 --> 40:51.231
ANYTHING FOR
THE PEOPLE SHE LOVES.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.537
THAT'S TRUE.
YOUR AUNTIE COOP

40:52.580 --> 40:54.452
LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.496
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GET IT.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.802
GET WHAT?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.458
IF SHE LOVES ME,

41:00.501 --> 41:01.894
THEN WHY'D SHE
KILL MY MOM?

41:05.637 --> 41:07.421
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S THE JUNIORS

41:07.465 --> 41:08.814
WHO CAUSED THIS MESS.

41:08.857 --> 41:11.947
YOU JUST GOTTA SAY
EXACTLY WHO DID IT.

41:11.991 --> 41:14.689
CARTER IS--HE'S SERIOUS
ABOUT EXPELLING YOU.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.038
AIN'T NO WAY
CARTER'S KICKING ME OUT

41:16.082 --> 41:17.126
OVER A PRANK.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.912
BILLY: WELL...
SPENCER: RIGHT?

41:27.136 --> 41:29.312
DAD, YOU COULDN'T EVEN
MAKE IT HOME

41:29.356 --> 41:30.836
BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP?

41:33.316 --> 41:34.492
POP.

41:35.928 --> 41:36.972
DAD.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.150
CALL 911.

41:41.194 --> 41:43.979
DAD. DAD?

41:46.155 --> 41:47.983
DAD, WAKE UP.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.768
DAD.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.596
OH, MY GOD, DAD.

42:18.144 --> 42:19.493
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
