I got the ring on my hand.
I met my beautiful wife.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.979
- Ahh!
- [chuckles]

09:33.063 --> 09:34.573
I don't think this could
have gone any better.

09:34.732 --> 09:35.815
Cheers to holding it down.
- New husband.

09:35.899 --> 09:37.817
Oh, my gosh.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.153
<i>[soft music]</i>

09:40.237 --> 09:41.413
<i>- I'm attracted to my wife.</i>

09:41.497 --> 09:43.665
I think she's beautiful.
As far as chemistry goes,

09:43.749 --> 09:45.500
<i>I sense something there,
for sure.</i>

09:45.585 --> 09:47.910
- But you feel good now?
You don't feel nervous at all?

09:47.995 --> 09:49.329
- I feel pretty good.
Yeah.

09:49.413 --> 09:50.747
So if you need some support,
by all means.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.008
- I will need a lot of support.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.427
I actually feel very calm,
now that I've met you, though.

09:55.586 --> 09:57.086
Like, I was saying,
like--I was like,

09:57.171 --> 09:59.255
I have butterflies,
and my stomach is in knots,

09:59.340 --> 10:00.840
and I was having
all this stomach pain.

10:00.924 --> 10:03.426
I was like, "I might need to go
to urgent care or something.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.186
Like, I feel really not well."

10:05.271 --> 10:07.847
Now that I've met you,
I actually feel a lot better.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.857
That's weird.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.025
- Cool. Yeah.
I mean, you know--

10:10.109 --> 10:11.434
- That's a good sign.
- Yeah. I think--

10:11.518 --> 10:12.935
- Yeah.
- I think, you know,

10:13.020 --> 10:14.362
we do definitely have a lot
to learn about each other...

10:14.447 --> 10:16.281
- Yeah.
- In order to get comfortable.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.357
But I already feel like,
you know, we have--

10:17.441 --> 10:18.524
- I know!

10:18.609 --> 10:19.618
- You know, we have
great conversation.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.869
- It's so great.
I mean, we were even

10:20.953 --> 10:22.111
making jokes
with each other at the altar.

10:22.196 --> 10:23.371
- Yeah!
- We barely know each other.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.531
- And the jokes
on both sides of the--

10:25.616 --> 10:29.294
- I know! I was like, what?
This is so crazy!

10:29.453 --> 10:32.797
He's so sweet,
and he's really funny!

10:32.956 --> 10:36.042
And he brought me--
He got me a Ring Pop.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.802
At first, I thought
he bought me two diamond rings,

10:37.887 --> 10:39.554
but when he pulled out
the Ring Pop, I'm like,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.632
"Oh, my God!
I like you even more now!"

10:42.716 --> 10:44.225
- Getting rid
of expectation--like,

10:44.310 --> 10:45.977
we can't predict
what's gonna happen.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.228
We don't know
who each other are.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.305
You know, until we interact,
then it's just...

10:49.390 --> 10:50.231
- Yeah.
- Open-ended.

10:50.391 --> 10:52.308
So...
- I know.

10:52.393 --> 10:54.644

10:54.728 --> 10:56.404

10:56.489 --> 10:58.740
But I think we--we have
a pretty good chance here.

10:58.899 --> 11:01.067

12:35.412 --> 12:36.329
"What do you think
she's gonna look like?"

12:36.422 --> 12:37.756
And I keep saying,
"I'm not thinking

12:37.915 --> 12:38.840
that she's
gonna look like anything."

12:38.924 --> 12:40.166
- Say, "Whatever my wife
looks like."

12:40.259 --> 12:42.835
- Whatever--that's my wife
you're talking about!

12:42.928 --> 12:44.846

12:59.528 --> 13:00.945

you're nervous,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.113

13:11.031 --> 13:13.708
Are you sure?
- Yep.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.877
- We matched Alyssa and Chris

13:15.961 --> 13:18.788
because they're both direct
and honest communicators

getting married today.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.988
