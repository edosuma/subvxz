WEBVTT

01:07.943 --> 01:08.944
Oh, no.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
Mr. Breem. I didn't see you there.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.288
You're sneaky.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.748
Five-second rule, right?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.587
But only if we could eat in here.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.506
Which we can't,
so I'll just put that in there.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.675
How can I help you, sir?

01:32.301 --> 01:35.637
I need a security tape from last night,
camera eight.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.474
Sassy Colors has
some unaccounted for merchandise.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.767
Wait, Sassy Colors got robbed?

01:40.851 --> 01:43.228
We don't wanna jump to conclusions.
It could be anything.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.314
Could be a raccoon.
You know, they can lift objects.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.274
One of them ripped the face
off my buddy's cat.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.067
-Tommy.
-The tape.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.616
Oh, shit.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.994
Someone must've forgotten
to load the tape.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.664
And that someone was trained by me.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.834
Sir, I take full responsibility.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.794
I owe you and the good people
of Sassy Colors a sincere apology.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.464
I fucked up.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.966
Mistakes are how we learn.

02:13.926 --> 02:16.845
Just… don't make the same one twice.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.764
Sir, you have my word on that.

02:23.852 --> 02:24.978
Take care, sir.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.399
All right, let's get back to business.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.491
Holy shit!

02:37.574 --> 02:39.243
Holy shit is right, bro.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.703
Mormon boss man jacking it
in his own mall.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.499
They're not even allowed to jerk off
in their own house.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.000
-What?
-Yeah.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.544
No, that's just cruel.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.128
-You're not even seeing the best part.
-Dude.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.257
Look at the freaky housewife
flicking the bean on this other angle.

02:53.924 --> 02:54.925
See, right there.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.635
Right there.

02:58.929 --> 02:59.930
There.

03:02.850 --> 03:06.144
Wow. That's intimate.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.522
And also, really public.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.731
Why would they do that?

03:10.566 --> 03:14.403
I mean, you know,
maybe they got lost in the moment.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.280
Like, really lost.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.031
Boss man knows where the cameras are.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.408
He put 'em in himself.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.953
He came by to check on 'em this morning,
but sadly…

03:23.036 --> 03:25.289
some stoner forgot to load the tapes.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.000
He was super gracious about that error.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.586
Bet he was.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.255
Hey, good eye, bro.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.424
Thanks, bro. I just look for the story.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.437
Baby.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.524
-This is-- This is--
-Yeah?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.485
-This could save us.
-Yeah?

03:57.821 --> 03:59.072
Oh, my--

04:00.574 --> 04:01.617
Oh, my God.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.368
Oh, my God!

04:05.454 --> 04:06.705
Oh, my God.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.556
Sweetie.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.558
Jesus-- I di--

04:28.227 --> 04:29.228
Good morning.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.104
You scared me.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.356
Where's Daddy?

04:33.649 --> 04:35.234
In the bathroom, I think.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.818
What kind of eggs do you want today?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.070
Daddy's.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.993
Sweetie, I know it was hard
seeing me a little sad and sick,

04:45.077 --> 04:46.495
but I'm better now.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.288
So I can make you whatever you want.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.790
I just want cereal.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.127
Okay. Perfect.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.007
From Daddy.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.010
You think you wanna punish me now?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.930
Just wait. You have no idea.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.559
All right. Good morning.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.062
Sun's up. Mom's up. What's for breakfast?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.147
Cereal. She wants you to make it.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.691
Okay. I can do that.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.318
Let's see how fast I can go.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.945
Daddy lightning!

05:20.028 --> 05:21.488
One! Two!

05:24.074 --> 05:25.742
Just a reminder, I'm out all day.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.745
I have a big meeting in Los Angeles.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.748
Yeah, well,
we have a pretty big day ourselves.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.916
Don't we?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.626
Little Cadets, I signed her up.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.046
Little Cadets? I thought we decided
that was a little paramilitary for us?

05:38.130 --> 05:41.258
Yeah, but, you know, some of the moms
were talking about it at drop-off,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.135
and I kinda thought, "Eh," you know?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.638
-Here you go, sweetie.
-Some moms, huh?

05:47.139 --> 05:48.473
Yeah.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.892
Like Wanda?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.603
Yeah, uh-huh. She was there.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.397
She was one of them. Why? Jealous?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.733
Tell him. Who you are, what you do.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.029
You know, I did scouts when I was a kid,
and I loved it.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.157
They gave us Buck knives. Big ones.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.408
I want a knife.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.744
Yeah, of course you do.
I wish I still had mine.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.245
I kept it in a sheath.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.289
And we got to shoot arrows.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.042
Wait till you get to shoot an arrow.
It feels so good.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.127
You'll have the car today
'cause Greta's driving me.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.712
Where?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.422
-To LA, for the meeting.
-Hey, we gotta eat.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.424
If you wanna go, we gotta eat.
There you go.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.468
He doesn't care. He doesn't need to.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.512
This is your dream, all yours.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.758
You want a cup? Just finished brewing.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.719
Just kidding, I know.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.639
Apologies for coming unannounced.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.352
Your father liked to do that too.

07:16.645 --> 07:21.900
Unplanned visits make us
feel… less guilty, don't they?

07:25.946 --> 07:26.947
Come on in.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.372
I'm not sure about this suit.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.251
I was going for chairman of the board,
but I feel like mother of the bride.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.335
I love this look.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.504
This is the perfect blend of professional,

07:42.588 --> 07:44.256
and, like,
you're so pretty I want to kill you.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.340
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.426
If it isn't the crown princess of cardio.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.055
Looking just as good out of a leotard
as you do in one.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.934
So, we're looking good.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.061
How are we feeling
after everything you've been through?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.189
-Rested.
-Excellent.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.276
I'm, eager to, talk to you

08:04.359 --> 08:06.570
about the ideas I have for steps forward.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.821
I think that's wonderful.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.948
You've taken an interest in strategy.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.992
You know,
not a lot of the talent does that.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.829
I actually prepared a summary sheet.

08:15.913 --> 08:16.997
Firstly,

08:17.080 --> 08:19.249
I love what you have me doing so far.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.628
The trade shows
and the personal appearances.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.255
But I am committed to growing my business

08:25.339 --> 08:29.009
beyond just the how-to market

08:29.092 --> 08:32.346
into more of a lifestyle brand.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.767
Well, we can certainly discuss
what's in store for your next tape.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.686
Maybe a jazzy new font for the sleeve?

08:39.770 --> 08:44.650
What I would love is to expand
into exercise equipment and clothing

08:44.733 --> 08:46.109
and cookbooks.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.736
It's all there on the summary sheet.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.614
A road map to my own lifestyle brand.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.908
Your lifestyle brand?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.410
The way we see it,

08:56.411 --> 09:01.041
you are one important member
of the Stahl/Grunner family of brands.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.794
He's threatened.
Make it sound like his idea.

09:04.628 --> 09:08.465
Well, remember when you talked
about making me a household name?

09:09.341 --> 09:12.010
This is really just a way to do that.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.638
Only maybe a little faster
than you planned.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.224
You know, I'll tell you what.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.603
I'll take a look at your ideas,
and I'll run 'em up the flagpole.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.399
I thought you were the flagpole.
That's why I asked to meet with you.

09:26.650 --> 09:32.531
Well, I am a flagpole,
but the founders weigh in.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.450
They're still alive?

09:35.534 --> 09:38.871
Yes. Mr. Stahl and Mr. Grunner
are still very much alive.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.957
Mr. Stahl a little more so.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.586
He comes in most weeks,
opens his mail, has his soup.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.213
Well…

09:49.715 --> 09:52.885
Are you familiar with Vinnie Green?

09:52.968 --> 09:56.555
He has these long-form television ads.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.432
I'm familiar with infomercials.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.058
I don't sleep.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.685
Well then you must have seen him?

10:01.768 --> 10:04.479
Yes, he's, very memorable.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.816
Lively. A real character.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.027
How many ways are there not to say gay?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
Well, he started with a tape,

10:12.029 --> 10:15.073
and now he's selling a whole weight loss
system direct to consumers.

10:15.157 --> 10:19.453
He's appealing to a very different… sector

10:19.536 --> 10:21.663
of the population than we are.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.999
We are a family company.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.626
If you catch my drift.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.377
If? You'd have to be an idiot.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.507
Well, like it or not,
direct to consumer is the future.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.717
And I'm not talking thousands of units.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.637
I'm talking millions. Millions.

10:37.221 --> 10:39.264
Can you see it, Auggie? Because I can.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.979
You know what I can see?

10:47.231 --> 10:50.567
You signing a contract with us.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.444
Remember that?

10:52.528 --> 10:57.074
Now, I don't wanna say you owe us,
but, well, you do.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.326
You owe us.

10:59.409 --> 11:03.080
And since we're already out-of-pocket
because of your difficulties of late--

11:03.163 --> 11:04.414
I had a medical issue.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.167
-It was completely out of my control.
-We're gonna need you

11:07.251 --> 11:10.462
to stick to the plan. Our plan.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.218
Thanks for stopping by.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.347
Over.

11:22.099 --> 11:25.018
And under.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.397
And now, you guessed it!

11:28.939 --> 11:33.485
Over, and back under again.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.322
I practiced this exact same way
with my mother,

11:37.406 --> 11:41.118
and my mother practiced
this exact same way with her mother.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.536
Can you believe that?

11:42.619 --> 11:43.620
Yes.

11:44.913 --> 11:48.083
-What's next? Over!
-Hey.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.002
That's right.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.045
Under.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.007
I'm sorry, but she's got them sewing.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.301
And not even sewing-sewing.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.428
It's pretend-sewing, and it's pathetic.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.971
It looks like she's having fun.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.182
Yeah, that's 'cause
she doesn't know any different.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.767
God, just seeing these little girls
being trained

12:05.851 --> 12:09.938
for this domestic, submissive behavior
at such a young age-- Just--

12:10.022 --> 12:12.232
You'd prefer they learn it
when they get a bit older?

12:12.316 --> 12:13.817
Like, maybe in their first marriages?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.696
No, I don't want it to happen at all.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.990
That would be great.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.367
Over…

12:22.451 --> 12:24.953
Wow! That is really good.

12:25.037 --> 12:28.123
I'm not even an oatmeal raisin guy,
but that is excellent.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.208
-Wow. Yeah.
-Thank you.

12:31.793 --> 12:35.964
You haven't said anything
about, what happened on television?

12:36.048 --> 12:39.510
I wasn't sure if you were happy
with the PBS SoCal piece.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.094
I hadn't heard from you.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.263
I heard from a lot of other people.

12:43.347 --> 12:47.142
Yeah, this, commercial talent agency
called me and wanted to talk about Leo.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.436
I said,
"My son is not selling hamburgers on TV."

12:49.520 --> 12:51.355
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, it was…

12:52.981 --> 12:55.943
It was, you know, great. It was nice.
And Leo was really great.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.280
Okay.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.867
Honestly?
It was actually really disappointing.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.662
Instead of actually
talking about real issues,

13:06.745 --> 13:08.497
they decided to play the cute kid card.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.666
It was emotional manipulation
over substance,

13:10.749 --> 13:14.503
which is what happens anytime
you combine television and politics.

13:14.586 --> 13:18.340
Okay, so you are jealous of a 12-year-old?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.634
That's a wild oversimplification
of my point.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.220
You know, I had a sense deep down
that you were a jerk.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
Not even that deep down,
come to think of it.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.223
I-- What?

13:27.516 --> 13:28.767
You wanna know what I am?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.519
I'm a straight shooter, okay?

13:30.602 --> 13:33.021
I tell people like it is,
and oftentimes that gets me in trouble.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.607
What do you want me to do?
I can't apologize for having strong views

13:35.691 --> 13:37.568
about an organization that,
let's face it--

13:37.651 --> 13:39.361
Daddy! Do you like mine?

13:42.990 --> 13:43.991
I…

13:45.492 --> 13:47.828
I love you, sweetie.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.413
I love you.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.334
Running it up the flagpole
is just another way of saying no.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.879
Stay the course.
Forget embracing new ideas.

13:56.962 --> 14:00.048
Maybe. But maybe they just need time
to think about it.

14:00.132 --> 14:03.093
Ernie takes his time with new ideas.
Does happen.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.053
They think they're smarter than I am
about this,

14:05.137 --> 14:07.389
-and they're not even--
-No way, Jose.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.224
He kept saying they're a family company.

14:09.308 --> 14:12.936
They don't know anything about families.
And they don't know anything about women.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.855
What we want or how we think and--

14:15.939 --> 14:17.024
I love that bag.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.109
Can you see me with that bag?

14:19.193 --> 14:22.487
Yes, I can.
You should get it. Treat yourself.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.365
I can't. I mean, I can, but I can't.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.034
It's too much.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.287
Not important. Sorry, I'm all yours.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.665
You know, I should just be grateful
that I got to make the tape at all,

14:33.749 --> 14:38.212
and I should just do whatever they tell me
'cause they're the experts.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.880
You don't believe that.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.966
-Buy the purse.
-I can't.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.426
I shouldn't.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.636
It's too much.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.929
You're rich.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.308
It just doesn't feel like me.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.394
Oh, gosh! We should be getting back, yeah?
This was fun.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.564
Would you be okay
with making one more stop?

15:01.151 --> 15:04.947
Only you would sit on this
for four months.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.157
My pure of heart babe.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.788
You know, I don't like to judge people
on their choices.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.414
It's their fucking choice, you know?

15:14.498 --> 15:18.293
And some people make dumb choices
that they pay for.

15:18.377 --> 15:22.381
And ultimately, that's what swayed me.
Actions have consequences.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.716
You create a harbor, you kill the wave.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.969
You steal my girl's moves, you're a poser.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.054
And if you fuck with us, we will f--

15:29.137 --> 15:30.264
Look, he's pulling in.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.103
You're so hot when you're like this.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.981
-All dialed in--
-Don't distract me. We're working here.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.361
We've got a lot to figure out.
We gotta see what we're working with here.

15:47.406 --> 15:51.285
Hang on. It's not Breem. It's…

15:53.245 --> 15:54.413
the wife.

16:30.324 --> 16:31.992
As good as it is to see you,

16:32.743 --> 16:36.788
are we eventually going to get to
what brings you by?

16:40.459 --> 16:41.668
Can't say for sure.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.962
Intriguing start.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.925
Not that I care one way or another.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.636
Human company is always welcomed here.

16:50.719 --> 16:54.389
I've been known to conversate
with seagulls from time to time, so…

16:55.057 --> 16:56.058
How's that go?

16:57.059 --> 16:58.644
Asymmetrically.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.396
They are terrible listeners.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.320
Hey, John.

17:11.448 --> 17:15.202
Due to capital infusions
into the marina project,

17:15.285 --> 17:16.494
your dividend will--

17:16.578 --> 17:20.707
and dividends across the board
for all the original investors

17:20.790 --> 17:23.794
will be less than in quarters passed. So…

17:24.545 --> 17:26.003
Sounds good, John.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.632
Sounds good.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.682
I'm wanting to make the same mistake.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.477
I mean, I do and I don't,

17:41.895 --> 17:43.647
wanna make the same mistake he did.

17:45.148 --> 17:48.151
That… That Dad did.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.739
You're gonna have to be more specific.

18:05.002 --> 18:06.962
-All right. Now's our chance. Come on.
-Okay.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.047
Come on!

18:09.131 --> 18:10.465
Hi, Mr. Green?

18:10.549 --> 18:12.176
Mr. Green, I'm so sorry to bother you--

18:12.259 --> 18:13.719
Oh, no, ladies.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.471
No, we can't do autographs today. No.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.890
But I love you.

18:18.599 --> 18:19.808
That's a great blazer.

18:20.434 --> 18:24.897
Thanks. I need to talk to you.

18:26.690 --> 18:27.816
About what, sweetheart?

18:29.318 --> 18:32.905
Just how you became you.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.198
Nice one, dingbat.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.658
Let us buy you lunch.
We only need an hour.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.369
Whatever his consulting fee is,
we'll double it.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.922
You do think this is what we've
been waiting for?

18:50.005 --> 18:53.050
-I do think it might be.
-Do you know what's waiting for you later?

18:54.676 --> 18:55.886
What is this?

18:56.553 --> 18:58.555
-Oh, babe.
-I would not miss it.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.599
I would not miss it.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.356
Oh, my God.

19:09.483 --> 19:14.279
Over time,
Porter stopped wearing his altogether.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.782
This was his.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.659
No shit.

19:21.662 --> 19:22.704
Sorry.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.501
I wish you two--

19:31.797 --> 19:34.383
I wish he would've
followed the righteous path.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.598
Look, you may know what that is,

19:42.266 --> 19:45.102
but I certainly don't.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.855
Oh, yeah, I certainly do.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.357
Well, congratulations.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.150
-That must be nice.
-It isn't.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.527
Not anymore.

19:53.610 --> 19:58.323
I'm seeing other paths. Other…

20:02.494 --> 20:03.745
I don't know.

20:03.829 --> 20:06.248
I'm not sure what to say, John. Honestly.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.793
But I can tell you
that we were happy with our arrangement.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.545
We were.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.714
A happy man doesn't go and--

20:13.797 --> 20:16.175
He was unhappy for other reasons.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.969
His life didn't give him
all that he needed,

20:20.220 --> 20:25.309
but I've never, not for a second,
felt responsible for what he was lacking.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.560
For what he needed.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.520
And what did he need?

20:30.314 --> 20:31.481
What do you need?

20:32.608 --> 20:35.319
I need someone to tell me
it's okay to leave it all behind.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.865
No one's ever gonna tell you that.

20:40.949 --> 20:41.950
Yeah.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.122
I should go.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.586
But now that you've said it out loud…

21:14.191 --> 21:16.235
She must've dropped a couple thousand
in there.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.195
Money means nothing to these people.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.655
See what I'm talking about?

21:20.572 --> 21:21.907
How much should we ask for?

21:22.407 --> 21:24.201
Sky's the limit, I think.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.870
She can't even carry
all the bags she bought.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.705
Makes me sick.

21:52.187 --> 21:55.774
I always ask for the dressing on the side.
Otherwise, what a waste.

21:55.858 --> 21:59.403
You take a beautiful salad,
and you drown it in sugar and fat.

22:00.571 --> 22:02.489
And don't get me started on Cobb salads.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.616
It's a bacon cheeseburger
without the bun.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.246
You know, we're working
on a line of fat-free salad dressings,

22:09.329 --> 22:10.747
but we're still zhuzhing the flavors.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.709
Marika is very particular about flavors.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.627
And Marika is?

22:15.711 --> 22:17.921
The beautiful woman
I share my home with.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.590
Oh, God.

22:20.424 --> 22:21.425
Well, I was just curious--

22:21.508 --> 22:23.594
My father came to this country
with nothing.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.471
He washed dishes in a restaurant
and slept on the floor.

22:26.555 --> 22:29.600
Worked his way up to owning
40 sandwich franchises all over the South.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.686
And boy, did he want me to walk
in his footsteps, but I had other plans.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.897
This thing doesn't have
a pause button, does it?

22:34.980 --> 22:36.481
On the dance floor.

22:37.316 --> 22:38.901
Dance was my passion.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.279
But nobody was gonna hire me as a hoofer
when I looked like a heifer, you know?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.405
I was a big kid.

22:43.488 --> 22:46.742
Being forced to work all day and night
in a sandwich shop will do that to you.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.911
Well, your father must be
very proud of you now.

22:48.994 --> 22:49.995
We don't speak.

22:50.996 --> 22:52.331
Well, I'm a fitness instructor.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.917
I started in the studio,
and then I made my first--

22:55.000 --> 22:56.585
I know who you are.

22:56.668 --> 22:57.753
I've seen the tape.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.214
The workout.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.633
Wow. Thank you.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.426
For what? He didn't compliment you.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.428
Marika shows me things from time to time

23:06.512 --> 23:08.222
if she thinks
I might find them interesting.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.477
Well, I just fell into it.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.979
I fell in love with aerobics
and what it could do for me,

23:16.063 --> 23:18.315
and I wanted to share that with others.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.525
I danced too.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.153
-Ballet? I'm guessing from your form.
-Yes, that's right.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.239
I could never lift my leg higher
than a footstool.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.450
But you can get away with it
in modern and jazz.

23:28.534 --> 23:32.579
I really was just curious
how you made that transition

23:32.663 --> 23:34.957
from tape to television.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.625
You know, I'm having a hard time

23:36.708 --> 23:38.961
getting my people to really listen
to my suggestions.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.546
Easy.

23:41.088 --> 23:43.215
-I don't have people.
-Okay, but then how do you--

23:43.298 --> 23:45.509
Five years ago,
I was working in a dance studio,

23:45.592 --> 23:48.428
praying for a promotion from desk duty.
And then…

23:50.138 --> 23:51.223
I met Marika.

23:51.974 --> 23:53.934
And she believed in me.

23:54.017 --> 23:57.187
And that's all it took for me
to take control of my life and my future.

23:57.271 --> 24:00.691
One beautiful woman who truly believed.

24:01.275 --> 24:02.526
I control my own name.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.820
I control my own business.

24:04.903 --> 24:07.531
And nobody tells me what to do or say.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.702
Except Marika?

24:13.161 --> 24:15.080
Well, everyone needs a partner.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.541
You two have each other, which is a start.

24:17.624 --> 24:21.253
Oh, no, sorry. We're not together.
We're just friends.

24:21.336 --> 24:25.048
I would love to have more control,
but I'm in a contract with Stahl/Grunner.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.133
I can't just walk away.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.303
Some of us are never ready
to leave Daddy's house,

24:29.386 --> 24:33.265
however unfeeling
or cruel Daddy was to us.

24:33.348 --> 24:34.433
Am I right about that?

24:34.516 --> 24:36.351
Easy guess. He doesn't know you.

24:36.435 --> 24:39.229
I know I am because I had it too.

24:39.313 --> 24:41.815
Don't you get sucked in
by this cheap trick.

24:41.899 --> 24:43.817
Oh, my gosh. I think you are.

24:44.610 --> 24:48.280
Sorry, I just hate seeing you--

24:49.406 --> 24:50.657
You deserve better

24:50.741 --> 24:52.951
than what you settle for, that's all.

24:53.035 --> 24:55.329
Is she right? Is that what you do?

24:56.246 --> 24:57.331
No one's making any decisions.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.624
…mess with people like this.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.959
You know,
I'm starting a line of workout tights

25:01.043 --> 25:02.211
called Vinnie's Skinnies.

25:02.294 --> 25:07.090
It's a patented moisture-wicking fabric
that will revolutionize fitness attire.

25:07.174 --> 25:11.970
I'd love to talk to you about being
one of our sales partners.

25:12.888 --> 25:15.182
Marika can get in touch
if you're interested?

25:15.265 --> 25:17.601
-She just looked so…
-Yeah.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.979
Like my mom when she'd spend
all dinner watching the clock,

25:21.063 --> 25:22.898
just getting tighter and tighter.

25:23.649 --> 25:24.650
Yeah.

25:25.484 --> 25:29.071
This thing,
this could cause a lot of pain.

25:29.154 --> 25:31.240
Like, we could open up a world of hurt.

25:32.115 --> 25:36.078
I don't wanna be the one
that goes around, like, stabbing people.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.873
I especially don't wanna stab kids.

25:39.957 --> 25:43.544
No, I couldn't live with that
on my conscience.

25:43.627 --> 25:45.587
Like, kids are innocent.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.548
The only pure thing in this world.

25:49.258 --> 25:53.512
But in a lot of ways,

25:54.388 --> 25:56.390
we're on the kids' side.

25:59.101 --> 26:00.644
They hurt her.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.731
They hurt them. It's not us.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.777
We made a mistake once.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.947
When we signed up
for that cassette tape club?

26:12.030 --> 26:14.992
When we let Sheila convince us
that she had the power.

26:16.535 --> 26:20.330
But we have righteousness on our side,
and that's something you can't buy.

26:26.670 --> 26:27.754
Hello?

26:34.511 --> 26:37.222
Yeah! Nice.

26:47.191 --> 26:49.693
-Yeah, that's my girl.
-Yay!

26:50.652 --> 26:53.572
-Wha-- Hey, guys.
-Hey.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.741
What's going on out here?

26:55.824 --> 26:59.745
Well, Little Cadets didn't turn out
to be quite what we expected,

26:59.828 --> 27:02.164
so we decided to take matters
into our own hands.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.333
How about you? How was your day?

27:04.416 --> 27:07.669
I-- You know, it wasn't too different
than that.

27:09.505 --> 27:10.839
Is that safe, babe?

27:11.340 --> 27:14.092
No. That's the point.
It's pretty dangerous.

27:14.176 --> 27:16.428
-I mean, it's knives.
-Okay.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.055
Let's do another one. Ready?

27:18.138 --> 27:20.891
You're gonna set your elbow,
you're gonna aim it at the wood

27:20.974 --> 27:23.018
and throw it as hard as you can.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.102
Yeah.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.858
Bunny. Tyler.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.611
I wasn't expecting you guys.

27:34.154 --> 27:37.115
Did you have some questions
on the notes for my routine?

27:37.991 --> 27:41.328
No. I won't be doing your routine.

27:42.246 --> 27:43.705
I thought we had agreed?

27:43.789 --> 27:45.707
Then I looked at the check,
and you were short.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.169
About $24,500 short.

27:49.253 --> 27:52.714
Look… I told you
I was inspired by your class.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.049
I enjoyed your class.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.759
But it was a start, okay?

27:55.843 --> 27:57.219
I don't owe you anything.

27:57.302 --> 27:59.388
What I've created is mine and mine alone.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.265
No, Sheila, it's not.

28:01.348 --> 28:02.891
But that's not why we're here.

28:03.976 --> 28:08.272
We're here because of what you
and that tight-ass Mormon are doing

28:08.355 --> 28:10.482
on this security tape from the mall.

28:12.025 --> 28:14.278
When you were yanking à la mode.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.656
Babe? Who is it?

28:20.158 --> 28:22.035
It's just Avon.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.537
I'll be right in.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.135
You're bluffing.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.887
No, I'm a terrible liar.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.555
He has no poker face.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.183
I always thought you were kinda cold,

28:44.266 --> 28:46.602
but publicly jacking it
with a married man?

28:46.685 --> 28:49.146
Mormons aren't even allowed to jack it.

28:50.230 --> 28:53.275
Who wants to learn how to be healthy
from someone so messed up?

28:54.109 --> 28:55.110
Twenty-five grand.

28:55.194 --> 28:58.614
Or we send it to his wife,
your business partners,

28:59.781 --> 29:00.908
and Danny.

29:00.991 --> 29:02.075
One week.

29:02.576 --> 29:05.829
Either we get money,
or we get to watch you get destroyed.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.916
Either way, we are, like, psyched!

29:15.005 --> 29:16.423
Oh, my God.
