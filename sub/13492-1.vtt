13:31.144 --> 13:33.611
WELL, IT'S QUITE THE SPECTACLE
YOU HAVE TO COVER HERE.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.214

FROM THE RESERVATION.

THE EXPEDITION INTO MEXICO.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.106

FOR GENERAL GEORGE CROOK

14:04.177 --> 14:07.045

THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.512

14:21.261 --> 14:26.864
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN COMPARE NOTES
AS THIS THING GOES ALONG.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.566
I'D LIKE THAT.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.671

INTERVIEWING THE APACHE SCOUTS,

14:33.806 --> 14:36.407
THEY'RE CAMPED BY THEMSELVES
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.142
I WILL.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.614
THEY'RE FRIENDLY, RIGHT?
THEY'RE FRIENDLY APACHES?

14:42.749 --> 14:43.948
WELL, THEY'RE CERTAINLY
FRIENDLIER

14:44.083 --> 14:46.684

15:14.714 --> 15:16.981
OH, I DON'T KNOW...
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

15:16.983 --> 15:21.051
UM... WELL, YEAH,

15:29.796 --> 15:32.196
I WAS HOPING MAYBE
I COULD TAKE YOUR PHOTOGRAPH?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.264
NO.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.800
IF YOU DON'T LEAVE
HERE RIGHT NOW,

15:36.836 --> 15:38.803

WELL,
IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT,

WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

15:52.719 --> 15:53.618
IN THE OLD DAYS,

15:53.753 --> 15:54.819
WE MADE A POINT
OF KILLING WHITE EYES

15:54.954 --> 15:57.555
IF THEY SHOWED FEAR.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.690
WE ENJOYED TORTURING THEM
AND KILLING THEM SLOWLY

15:59.759 --> 16:02.292
IN ORDER TO PROLONG
THEIR SUFFERING.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.294

TO THE INDIAN SCHOOL

16:13.907 --> 16:15.773

16:15.809 --> 16:17.442
BUT NOW THAT HE'S BACK
ON THE RESERVATION,

16:17.444 --> 16:20.912
HE HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO
BESIDES HATE WHITE PEOPLE.

16:23.116 --> 16:23.981
NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS,

16:23.984 --> 16:25.917
HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY
KILLED ONE BEFORE.

AS YOU ARE AWARE,
THIS IS NOT CHICAGO.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.753

WOULD STARVE TO DEATH

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
UNLESS HE FOUND
OTHER EMPLOYMENT,

IN OCTOBER OF 1929.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.299

LOST EVERYTHING.

I PROPOSE YOU LET

25:26.392 --> 25:28.192
TAKE HER BACK
TO HER PEOPLE.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.461
WHEN YOUR TROOPS ARRIVE,
AN EXPEDITION CAN FOLLOW

25:30.596 --> 25:32.396

BEHIND.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.131
<i>WHEN CONTACT WITH HER TRIBE

<i>A TRADE COULD BE EFFECTED:</i>

THE GIRL FOR THE HUERTA BOY.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.469
THE SCOUTS ARE INDIANS,
TOO.

25:38.604 --> 25:40.337
WHAT'S TO PREVENT THEM
FROM LETTING HER GO?

25:40.373 --> 25:42.339
OR JOINING THE BRONCO APACHES
THEMSELVES?

25:42.474 --> 25:43.874
<i>MARGARET:

25:43.943 --> 25:46.209

26:03.095 --> 26:06.030
MARGARET: OH. NED, THEY DON'T
WANT MONEY, THEY WANT A TRIBE.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.764
THEIR PEOPLE ARE
BEING SLAUGHTERED.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.567
ABDUCTING A MALE CHILD...

26:09.702 --> 26:11.569
IN TIME, THE CHILD WILL
FORGET WHO HE WAS,

26:11.704 --> 26:14.638
WILL BECOME ONE OF THEM,
WILL PROCREATE.

26:14.773 --> 26:15.505
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE,

TO SURVIVE.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.444

BEING CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO THIS -

26:20.446 --> 26:21.512
YOU COULD HAVE MATERIAL

26:21.514 --> 26:22.846

26:28.921 --> 26:31.321

26:31.357 --> 26:33.123
IF CONTACT IS MADE
WITH THE BRONCO APACHES,

26:33.125 --> 26:35.326
IT'LL BE AN INCREDIBLE COUP.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.127
RIGHT. YOU COULD GET
THEIR VITAL STATISTICS

26:37.196 --> 26:39.129
WHILE THEY ROAST YOU
OVER THE FIRE.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.465
NO ONE IS GOING TO HARM

26:41.600 --> 26:43.667
THIS IS THE MOST PEACEABLE WAY
TO MAKE CONTACT

37:23.875 --> 37:27.911
MY WHOLE LIFE UNTIL NOW
HAS BEEN LIVED IN SCHOOL.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.245
MY MOTHER DIED
WHEN I WAS SEVEN -

37:29.248 --> 37:32.315
SHE HAD GONE TO SOUTH AMERICA
WITH MY ANTHROPOLOGIST FATHER

37:32.384 --> 37:34.517
AND CONTRACTED MALARIA.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.920
HE STAYED ON AND LIVED THERE
IN THE AMAZON

37:37.055 --> 37:39.789
WITH A PEOPLE
WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS UNKNOWN

37:39.791 --> 37:40.723

37:40.792 --> 37:42.792
UNTIL HE ENCOUNTERED THEM.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.597
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN ALL THIS TIME

37:47.732 --> 37:50.666
AND YET I INVOKED HIS NAME

TO GET ACCEPTED
BY THIS EXPEDITION.

37:53.471 --> 37:57.473
WOMEN AREN'T USUALLY ALLOWED
TO FIELD STUDY.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.276

38:11.657 --> 38:14.090
I WAS SENT TO AN ORPHANAGE,

38:14.159 --> 38:16.158
WHICH WASN'T AS BAD
AS IT SOUNDS.

38:16.194 --> 38:19.095

THEY WERE PRETTY NICE THERE.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.132
UH...

38:24.169 --> 38:27.837
I WENT TO WORK AT 16
AS A DISHWASHER,

38:32.911 --> 38:35.979
AND I SAVED UP
TO BUY A CAMERA.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.648
WHY?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.321
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING,

38:45.057 --> 38:49.225
IT KINDA ISN'T REAL
UNTIL YOU TELL SOMEBODY.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.529
I HAVEN'T HAD ANYONE
TO DO THAT WITH,

38:52.531 --> 38:54.297
SO...

38:55.300 --> 38:59.736
