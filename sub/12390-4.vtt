WHO DIDN'T GO TO PRISON.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE REASON
HE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT

08:50.830 --> 08:52.127
WAS THAT HE DROVE HIS CAR

09:14.620 --> 09:16.315

23:48.660 --> 23:50.116
RAYLENE IS IN AGONY
OVER THIS.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.628
I DIDN'T MEAN HER ANY HARM--

23:52.660 --> 23:53.729

GOING TO TELL HER?
I COULDN'T.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.829

AND THIS GUY'S WIFE?

24:00.070 --> 24:02.038
ARE YOU HAVING FEELINGS
FOR THIS WOMAN?

24:02.070 --> 24:03.196
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.003
NO, GUS.
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.064

24:06.110 --> 24:06.735

24:07.940 --> 24:08.907

24:10.780 --> 24:11.974
SOME SERIOUS CRUSHING HERE.

I AM CLOSE.

24:33.170 --> 24:36.196
I AM SO VERY CLOSE.

INSIDE THE KALISH TRAIL LOOP

TO RETURN THE MONEY

24:46.050 --> 24:47.005
AND GET ON
WITH MY LIFE.

24:49.780 --> 24:50.986
WE HAVE TO THINK THIS THROUGH.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.612
YEAH.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.215

24:56.260 --> 24:58.558
THEY WERE THE LUCKY ONES.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.024

TO PRISON,

25:01.060 --> 25:03.528

25:03.570 --> 25:05.197
I'VE BEEN LIVING AS A DEAD MAN.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.221
IF RAYLENE'S GOING TO
FIND OUT THAT I'M ALIVE,

25:07.270 --> 25:08.737
AT THE VERY LEAST

25:08.770 --> 25:09.794
DON'T LET IT COME
FROM A STRANGER.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.737
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL HE FINDS THAT MONEY.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.577
I DOUBT THAT'LL BE
ANYTIME SOON.

25:18.610 --> 25:20.043
HE DID HAVE COOL HAIR,
THOUGH.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.014
WE'RE MISSING
SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

25:22.050 --> 25:23.142

TO SOLVING THIS PUZZLE.

WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

25:28.190 --> 25:29.111
BECAUSE SHE'S IN DANGER.

WE WEREN'T GOING TO TELL HER?

25:38.670 --> 25:39.694
WE NEVER SAID THAT.

25:41.870 --> 25:42.996
WE FOUND HIM.
HE'S WITH HIS COUSIN.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.803

25:44.840 --> 25:47.206

WE DO HAVE A PLAN.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.282
AND ARE GOING TO STAY
FOR A WHILE.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.077

26:24.110 --> 26:25.600
I MEAN,
WHO SANCTIONED IT?

26:25.650 --> 26:26.947
APPROVED IT.
ABOVE YOU.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.840
I DON'T THINK I LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

HAS TO AUTHORIZE IT.

OH, THAT'S RIGHT,

WELL, IT STATES THAT--

26:46.730 --> 26:47.697

26:47.740 --> 26:48.695

IN THE JURISDICTION

TECH NICALLY,

26:54.680 --> 26:56.375

IN FEDERAL CASES.

26:56.410 --> 26:57.638
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.944

WE COULD SHARE INFO.

27:23.740 --> 27:25.105

AS MUSKETEERS

38:29.370 --> 38:30.962
I DID NOTHING OF THE KIND.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.059
I WAS FOLLOWING THE MONEY
AND PROTECTING RAYLENE.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.668
WHO TURNED OUT TO BE
THE DANGEROUS ONE.

38:34.710 --> 38:35.972
WHICH I PICKED UP

38:36.010 --> 38:37.671
FROM DETECTIVE LASSITER'S
MASSIVE BRAIN.

38:37.710 --> 38:38.677
NOT TRUE.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.974
TRUE.
TR-- NOT.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.011
IT WAS SO.

38:42.050 --> 38:44.416
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

38:44.450 --> 38:45.439
SO WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE THE MONEY IS?

38:46.990 --> 38:48.014
I GOT NOTHING FROM HIM,

38:48.050 --> 38:49.085
BUT IF HE FIGURES
ANYTHING OUT,

38:49.120 --> 38:50.348
I'LL BE THE FIRST
TO KNOW.

38:50.390 --> 38:51.527
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.824
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

38:53.860 --> 38:56.124
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
GIVING YOU CREDIT.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.469
TRYING TO GET ME
TO ADMIT YOU'RE PSYCHIC.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.023
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.094
NO, I HAVEN'T.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.768
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.028
YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY IT.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.061
SPENCER,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

39:05.110 --> 39:06.634
I WILL NEVER...

39:06.670 --> 39:08.433
NEVER, EVER SAY THOSE WORDS.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.469
WHICH WORDS?

39:09.510 --> 39:11.068
YOU KNOW WHICH WORDS.

39:11.110 --> 39:12.668
NO, MAN,
I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.

39:12.710 --> 39:13.699
WHICH WORDS?

39:16.780 --> 39:18.714
OH.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.012
[LOUDLY]:
THAT YOU THINK I'M A PSYCHIC.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.549
[QUIETLY]:
THOSE WORDS?

39:23.590 --> 39:24.955
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL THEM WHERE THE MONEY IS?

39:24.990 --> 39:26.753
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE MONEY IS.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.052
SURE YOU DO.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.921
YOU'RE SEEING...

39:29.960 --> 39:31.052
DIRT.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.398
AM I RIGHT?

39:33.430 --> 39:34.465
NO.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.365
WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY NOW?

39:51.820 --> 39:53.788
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

39:53.820 --> 39:54.809
IT'S SATURDAY.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.509
I THOUGHT WE'D GET
SOME FRESH AIR.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.016
WE DROVE AN HOUR OUT OF TOWN
TO GET SOME FRESH AIR?

39:58.060 --> 39:59.857
WELL, THERE'S THAT...

40:01.900 --> 40:03.720
AND...

40:05.170 --> 40:06.523
AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND

40:06.570 --> 40:08.765
THE DREAD PIRATE WILCROI-T'S
DIRTY BOOTY.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.633
SHAWN, THE GUY'S BEEN DIGGING
FOR FOUR YEARS.

40:11.670 --> 40:12.932
WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT
IN ONE AFTERNOON?

40:12.970 --> 40:14.528
90 MINUTES, TOPS.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.774
AND I BROUGHT
SOME CHICKEN

40:15.810 --> 40:17.038
FOR A HEARTY SNACK.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.446
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON FINDING IT?

40:19.480 --> 40:21.072
WELL, HE SAID HE DUG UP
EVERY INCH OF THE KALISH LOOP

40:21.110 --> 40:22.941
AFTER HE BURIED IT HERE, RIGHT?

40:22.980 --> 40:25.141
YES, THREE MILES' WORTH.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.714
BUT IT WAS DARK,
AND IT HAD RAINED,

40:26.750 --> 40:27.944
AND HE SAID HE THOUGHT
IT WAS RIGHT OFF THE PATH.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.014
HE MAY HAVE GOTTEN LOST.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.482
I HEARD THE STORY, SHAWN.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.021
DID HE REALIZE

40:32.060 --> 40:35.029
THAT THERE IS A "J" KALISH
AND AN "L" KALISH TRAIL?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.791
DUDE, IT'S COMPLETELY DEFUNCT.

40:37.830 --> 40:38.899
CHECK IT OUT.

40:38.930 --> 40:39.919
ONLY USED BY THE RANGERS

40:39.970 --> 40:40.959
FOR BACK FIRES,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.093
MEDICAL ACCESS,

40:43.140 --> 40:44.038
MUD SLIDE
EMERGENCY ROUTES,

40:44.070 --> 40:45.503
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,

40:45.540 --> 40:46.962
DURING A TORRENTIAL RAINSTORM.

40:47.010 --> 40:48.830
OTHERWISE, IT'S GATED,

40:48.880 --> 40:49.835
AND IT LOOKS
COMPLETELY ABANDONED

40:49.880 --> 40:51.108
FROM THE ROAD.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.876
OKAY, I FIND IT,
I GET CREDIT.

40:56.850 --> 40:57.976
I'M THE PSYCHIC.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.089
I HAVE TO GET A VIBRATION.

41:01.150 --> 41:02.754
"CHIEF? YES.

41:02.790 --> 41:06.578
"I'M GETTING A TRAILHEAD,
A PATHWAY...

41:06.630 --> 41:07.756
"AND SOMETHING ELSE.

41:07.790 --> 41:08.893
"WHAT IS IT?

41:08.930 --> 41:10.921
"CHICKEN BONES.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.769
"YES, TAN DOORI STYLE.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.199
"FRESH.

41:14.230 --> 41:16.733
"OH, I BET THEY WERE DELICIOUS.

41:16.770 --> 41:17.998
YES."

41:19.910 --> 41:24.176
[***]

41:27.110 --> 41:30.671
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

41:30.720 --> 41:33.939
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

41:33.990 --> 41:37.289
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

41:37.320 --> 41:42.553
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

41:42.600 --> 41:46.195
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN CRAWL *

41:48.900 --> 41:51.698
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

41:51.740 --> 41:55.039
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

41:55.080 --> 41:58.174
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

41:58.210 --> 41:59.973
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:00.010 --> 42:02.649
* THEY WILL PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:02.680 --> 42:05.911
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:05.950 --> 42:09.181
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *
