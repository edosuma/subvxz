<i>NARRATOR".
Another sparkling day in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:13.515
Look sharp, O'Toole.

00:13.723 --> 00:17.393
With the Queen of Diamonds back in town,
we've gotta be on our toes.

00:19.771 --> 00:23.858
Look up, O'Rourke. The diamond-dizzy dame
has been after the Pretzel Diamond for years.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.194
She's bound to make a go for it.

00:27.612 --> 00:30.240
Goldberg, look alive.

00:30.448 --> 00:35.453
Chief O'Hara's instructions were to stop the
Queen of Diamonds no matter what the cost.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:52.512 --> 00:55.431
- Chief O'Hara.
-At ease, O'Leary.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.975
Any trouble in here?

00:57.183 --> 00:58.893
No, chief. Everything's fine.

00:59.102 --> 01:02.021
- The Pretzel Diamond's still in there, is it?
-Yes, sir.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.607
That's all I wanted to know.

01:09.988 --> 01:11.739
The Queen of Diamonds.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.325
Thank you, darling.

01:14.534 --> 01:16.869
You're doing very well so far.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.039
All I ask is the chance
to be near you, Marsha.

01:20.415 --> 01:22.959
To bask in the light
of your adorable presence.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.794
Yes, yes, darling, later.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.963
Right now the diamond, remember?

01:27.171 --> 01:30.049
Of course, my dear. Uh, oh.
Bring your men and follow me.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.177
Yes, chief.
O'Toole, O'Rourke, Goldberg, follow me.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.023
The Queen of Diamonds.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.567
That's enough of that.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.194
Don't you recognize me?

01:55.283 --> 01:56.784
Why, it's Chief O'Hara.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.995
And she's-- She's...

02:00.663 --> 02:04.417
No guided tours today, darling.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.294
Chief, darling, the diamond.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.670
Oh, yes, my dear.

02:07.879 --> 02:10.006
- Bring us the Pretzel Diamond.
-But--

02:10.214 --> 02:13.509
Or perhaps you want to be arrested
for obstructing the law.

02:23.895 --> 02:25.313
There, my lovely.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.940
Now you can't doubt my sincerity.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.276
This is proof of my devotion.

02:30.485 --> 02:31.903
It's a start.

02:32.445 --> 02:36.449
Alas, 'tis a pale thing
beside your own beauty.

02:36.658 --> 02:41.537
Let's take the rock and let the rhetoric go,
shall we, darling?

02:41.746 --> 02:42.789
Do you have a bag?

02:54.342 --> 02:57.261
O'Leary, see that these two
don't make any trouble.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.513
Yes, chief.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.432
Anything you want in Gotham City
is yours, my lovely.

03:01.641 --> 03:05.478
Take my life. Take my love. Take my all.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.190
Do be careful, sir.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.152
There's no danger
with the power off, Alfred.

03:13.361 --> 03:17.782
- You think we'll have to replace it, Batman?
-I certainly hope not, Robin.

03:21.786 --> 03:24.872
There. You may turn the power on, Alfred.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.220
- Yes, I think it's going to work now.
-Lucky for us.

03:39.429 --> 03:42.598
It takes six months to manufacture
another Bat-diamond that big...

03:42.807 --> 03:45.351
...even with a giant hydraulic Bat-press.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.272
Yes, it would be difficult,
especially since, for our purposes...

03:49.480 --> 03:52.316
...it has to be far more pure
than a natural diamond.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.199
One moment, commissioner.

04:00.408 --> 04:04.537
-It's Commissioner Gordon, sir.
<i>- I'll</i> take it on the Bat-extension up here, Alfred.

04:04.996 --> 04:06.706
Yes, commissioner.

04:08.249 --> 04:12.336
Well, there must be some mistake. We've
all known Chief O'Hara for years. He'd never--

04:13.588 --> 04:14.714
I see.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.966
The Queen of Diamonds.

04:17.175 --> 04:21.512
Yes, it is serious. Perhaps far more serious
than any of us yet realize.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.723
We'll be right down, commissioner.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.767
What's wrong with Chief O'Hara?

04:25.975 --> 04:29.729
That, Robin, is a question
I hope we'll be able to answer.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.240
That's right, commissioner.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.741
Good bye.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.578
Was that all right? Did I do it right?

06:08.786 --> 06:11.831
Just fine, darling.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.876
You're not going to keep me in here,
are you, my love?

06:15.626 --> 06:17.837
Just for a little while.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.006
Please, let me be near you.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.092
I don't mind the cage,
as long as it's near you.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.760
Don't worry, darling.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.470
I'll visit you once a week.

06:26.679 --> 06:29.140
Please, Marsha, it's too cruel.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.892
Don't go, Marsha.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.310
Don't go, Marsha.

06:32.518 --> 06:33.769
It isn't fair, Marsha.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.396
Stay near us, Marsha.

06:35.605 --> 06:37.064
Marsha, please, come back.

06:37.273 --> 06:40.359
- Marsha! Marsha!
- Come back!

06:59.795 --> 07:02.256
Your report, Grand Mogul.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.091
The usual, Your Highness.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.012
One of your admirers attempted suicide
as proof of his devotion.

07:08.220 --> 07:12.892
He threw himself into an automatic dryer
and tried to tumble himself to death, but failed.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.311
How boring.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.605
What have you found out
about the Bat-diamond?

07:17.813 --> 07:18.981
We have ascertained...

07:19.190 --> 07:23.069
...that the Bat-diamond is used
as a power source for the Batcomputer.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.238
It is well over 10,000 carats in size.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.032
Magnificent.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.367
Where is it kept?

07:29.575 --> 07:31.077
In the Batcave, Your Highness.

07:31.285 --> 07:35.873
- But no one knows where the Batcave is.
-I will know where the Batcave is.

07:36.082 --> 07:39.251
In fact, I will be inside the Batcave...

07:39.460 --> 07:42.546
...once I've sprung my little trap.

07:42.755 --> 07:43.965
Is Cupid loaded?

07:44.173 --> 07:46.926
I will attend to that now, Your Highness.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.023
Be quick about it.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.484
We're expecting a guest.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.321
Ready, Your Highness.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.291
Good, good.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.211
Now Cupid will plant his little arrow...

08:22.420 --> 08:24.922
...where it'll do the most good.

08:26.257 --> 08:28.175
Holy Houdini, where's the commissioner?

08:28.384 --> 08:31.595
I don't know, Robin, but it's not like him.
He knew we were coming.

08:31.804 --> 08:35.015
Looks like Queen of Diamonds
is dealing from the bottom of the deck.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.642
I'm afraid you may be right.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.520
But all we can do is wait
till we hear from him...

08:39.729 --> 08:42.313
...and hope that he's not walking into a trap.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.530
Where is Chief O'Hara?

08:49.739 --> 08:52.408
What have you done with him,
you diabolical Mata Hari?

08:52.616 --> 08:54.618
If you've harmed a hair on O'Hara's head...

08:54.785 --> 08:58.581
...I'll have you in jail for the rest of your life.
-Don't be tiresome, darling.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.958
Here, sit down next to me and relax.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.587
Your hanky-panky won't work with me,
young lady. I want O'Hara.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.007
You don't find me the least bit attractive?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.801
Your charms are useless, you evil temptress.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.971
I'm not gonna dance to your little tune.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.724
Really?

09:16.932 --> 09:19.769
My only concern is Chief O'Hara.
Where is he?

09:24.982 --> 09:26.942
Ooh. Oh.

09:28.319 --> 09:29.653
Oh, my...

09:31.822 --> 09:35.201
Oh, my...

09:35.409 --> 09:39.497
You are my only concern, Marsha.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.541
You beautiful creature.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.044
I'm yours to command.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.046
That's better, darling.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.298
Tell me more.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.973
Commissioner Gordon's office.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.977
Yes, commissioner, we'll be right there.
Don't worry.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.981
The Queen of Diamonds
has added Commissioner Gordon to her list.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.526
Holy hypnotism,
what are we getting ourselves into?

10:08.734 --> 10:12.655
I don't know, Robin, but with Chief O'Hara
and Commissioner Gordon in her clutches...

10:12.863 --> 10:14.240
...we have no choice.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.700
Now, don't be difficult,
commissioner, darling.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.077
Don't leave me, Marsha.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.330
I just want to gaze at your beauty.
I'll do anything.

10:21.539 --> 10:24.458
I'll roll myself into a ball,
you can use me as your footstool.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.710
Just don't ever leave me.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.254
I'm sorry, darling.

10:28.462 --> 10:32.466
I have to pay a visit
to my dear old Aunt Hilda in the basement.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.010
She's mine. Mine.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.763
Never, O' Hara! She's mine!

10:37.972 --> 10:40.057
- Come back, Marsha!
-Come back, Marsha!

10:40.266 --> 10:44.937
Double, double, toil and trouble.

10:45.146 --> 10:48.190
Bubble, bubble. Ah. Ha-ha-ha.

10:48.607 --> 10:55.197
A notion, a potion,
for making a commotion. Ha-ha-ha.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.951
I have a potion...

10:59.160 --> 11:04.999
...that will do anything you want it to.

11:05.916 --> 11:10.337
Really, Aunt Hilda? Don't you think
you're carrying this thing a bit too far?

11:10.546 --> 11:12.756
Can't you let an old lady have a little fun?

11:12.965 --> 11:16.719
You go right ahead, darling,
and have all the fun you want to...

11:16.927 --> 11:19.597
...just as long as your potions
keep getting results.

11:19.805 --> 11:26.020
Remember, I was a chemistry professor
at Vassar for 20 years, deary.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.939
I remember. I also remember they fired you.

11:29.148 --> 11:34.195
Yes, I tried one of my potions
in the college cafeteria.

11:34.403 --> 11:40.326
And it turned the entire student body
orange for a week.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.245
That was before I completed my research.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.915
My potions are much better now.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.667
Yes, they have been getting good results...

11:48.876 --> 11:54.340
...but now I need a very special potion
for a very special purpose.

11:54.548 --> 11:58.510
This is my best batch. My very best batch.

11:58.719 --> 12:03.057
It's just lovely, and I've even added
a pound of dugong blubber.

12:03.974 --> 12:07.436
Is it powerful enough to work on Batman?

12:07.603 --> 12:10.481
Ooh. Batman is a special case.

12:10.689 --> 12:14.818
Bats have a very strong resistance
to occult powers.

12:15.027 --> 12:19.240
But if anything will work, this will.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.870
Pass me the salt, deary.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.296
Cupid is loaded, Your Highness.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.465
Good. Leave me now.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.467
I'll clap if I need you.

12:38.676 --> 12:41.095
Yes, Your Highness.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.103
Come in.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.191
<i>Watch</i> out, Batman.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.779
<i>The powers of darkness reside in this room.</i>

13:00.572 --> 13:04.827
Holy harem, Batman. What a nest.

13:06.036 --> 13:10.541
There's more here
than meets the eye, Robin.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.460
Welcome, darling.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.716
Welcome to my little flat.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.801
Sit down. Make yourselves comfortable.

13:21.010 --> 13:24.847
We're not here to be comfortable, Marsha.
This is strictly a business call.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.807
How very rude of you, Batman.

13:27.016 --> 13:29.852
Batman's never rude to a lady,
but you're no lady.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.272
She may not be a lady, Robin,
but she is a woman...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.566
...and as such, she deserves some courtesy.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.152
How very gallant of you, Batman.

13:38.652 --> 13:42.406
Let's dispense with the mutual flattery, Marsha.
Where are Commissioner Gordon...

13:42.573 --> 13:45.784
...and Chief O'Hara?
-How very irrelevant of you, Batman.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.953
They're unimportant.

13:48.162 --> 13:50.331
Let's talk about you and me.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.042
We have nothing to discuss
in that area, Marsha.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.210
We will, darling.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.589
- We will.
-Watch out, Batman, she's up to something.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.344
Ouch.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.179
Unh.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.475
-It's a dart.
-Poison.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.643
Oh, not poison, darling.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.813
Merely a disposition improver.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.942
It's some kind of a drug, Robin.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.862
It's bending my will.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.157
- Batman.
-Marsha.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.868
- Batman.
-Oh, Marsha.

14:28.077 --> 14:31.872
- Batman.
-Marsha.

14:32.081 --> 14:33.248
Fight it, Batman.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.293
Come. I'm trying.

14:36.502 --> 14:42.841
Robin, it's some kind of love-inducing drug.

14:43.050 --> 14:47.388
It's trying to bend my will, Robin.

14:47.971 --> 14:52.684
Ooh. To make me fall in love...

14:53.268 --> 14:55.479
...with Marsha.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.730
Batman.

14:57.398 --> 15:00.734
Holy fate worse than death,
you've got to resist it.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.862
I am trying. I'm trying, Robin.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.032
Don't try to fight it, darling.
Relax and worship me.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.997
Worship me, I said. On your knees.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.382
I prefer to stand, Marsha.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.428
Your drug didn't work.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.513
You did it, Batman.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.181
It wasn't easy, Robin.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.977
It took every last ounce of my willpower.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.854
You mean you're not in love with me?

15:37.396 --> 15:39.773
I'm not even mildly interested.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.651
Outrageous.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.447
How dare you reject Marsha,
Queen of Diamonds?

15:46.655 --> 15:50.909
This is insufferable effrontery. Bah!

15:58.417 --> 16:00.085
Carve them into camel food.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.004
Yes, Your Highness.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.145
No.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.190
He's mine.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.955
You adorable creature.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.958
I'm yours to command.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.670
Oh, no. Robin.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.422
Here's your first command,
my young worshipper.

17:27.631 --> 17:31.343
Stop that annoying fellow in the blue cape.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.310
Stop it, Batman.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.437
Marsha said, stop it.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.064
Do you hear?

17:44.273 --> 17:45.482
Do you hear?

17:45.691 --> 17:47.150
Robin, it's me, Batman.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.821
Batman, Batman. What do I care?
You're annoying Marsha.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.782
I'll fight you to the death.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.162
All right, I'll stop.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.460
Well done, darling.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.338
Grand Mogul,
take him to the suitors' quarters.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.756
- Don't touch him.
-Ah, ah!

18:09.965 --> 18:13.385
One false move and your young friend
remains at my feet forever.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.095
Only I can release him.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.099
If he had more experience,
he might have been able to resist your drug...

18:19.308 --> 18:21.143
...but you took advantage of his youth.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.564
Cooperate or Robin remains
in my power forever.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.234
All right, you win.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.237
No, let me stay near Marsha.
I'm hers to command.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.698
No, let me stay!

18:36.491 --> 18:39.286
Don't worry, Robin,
I'll get you out of this somehow.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.748
Well, Batman, what is he worth to you?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.751
This is not a joke. I'd give my life for that boy.

18:45.917 --> 18:49.338
Oh, the price isn't nearly that high, darling.

18:49.546 --> 18:52.049
I merely want the gigantic Bat-diamond...

18:52.257 --> 18:54.635
...that powers the Batcomputer.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.262
It's yours.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.474
But first you'll have to give Robin
the antidote for that drug.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.893
No, no, no, not so fast.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.021
I want to appropriate that diamond
myself personally.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.523
I wanna go into the Batcave and get it.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.067
That's impossible.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.860
Remember what's at stake.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.029
I couldn't do that, not even for Robin.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.783
I made a sacred vow that no stranger
would ever enter the Batcave.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.662
And knowing you,
you'd never break that vow, would you?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.288
Absolutely not.

19:24.706 --> 19:29.169
In that case, we'll have to figure out a way
to get me into the Batcave...

19:29.378 --> 19:31.254
...without breaking your vow, won't we?

19:32.422 --> 19:34.132
That can't be done.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.802
Oh, where there's a will, there's a way.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.178
Now, let's see.

19:38.387 --> 19:41.807
You made a vow that no stranger
would enter the Batcave.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.519
- What if I weren't a stranger?
-What do you mean?

19:45.727 --> 19:48.438
What if I were Mrs. Batman?

19:49.815 --> 19:51.149
Marry you?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.609
Why not, darling?

19:52.818 --> 19:55.737
As your wife, I'd have every right
to go in the Batcave.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.614
You must be joking.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.701
I never joke, darling.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.371
Besides, one vow deserves another.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.997
Now, think of Robin.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.252
Not to mention Commissioner Gordon
and Chief O'Hara.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.965
Unless we become a happy couple,
those three will spend the rest of their lives...

20:15.173 --> 20:17.384
...following me around on their knees.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.557
I have no choice.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.268
Wonderful, darling.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.109
Yes, Your Highness?

20:34.860 --> 20:37.738
Batman and I are to be married
this afternoon.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.365
Make all the necessary arrangements.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.951
Yes, Your Highness.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.456
Marsha, Queen of Diamonds.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.750
Mrs. Batman.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.419
Ha-ha-ha, how marvelous.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.759
This has been quite a day in Gotham City.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.429
First, the unexplained disappearance
of Police Chief O'Hara.

21:02.637 --> 21:05.307
Followed by the disappearance
of Commissioner Gordon.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.476
And now to top it all off...

21:07.684 --> 21:12.981
<i>...the announcement that Batman will marry
the Queen of Diamonds this afternoon.</i>

21:13.190 --> 21:17.986
<i>Who knows what will happen next
on this strange and baffling day?</i>

21:18.236 --> 21:20.530
Who knows indeed?

21:20.739 --> 21:26.161
As if anything could possibly matter
after Batman has married that woman.

21:26.369 --> 21:30.040
I'd venture to say, madam,
that Batman has been coerced in some fashion.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.918
He'd never submit to such a thing
of his own free will.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.836
Oh, I quite agree with you, Alfred.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.380
I'm sure there's skullduggery afoot.

21:37.589 --> 21:40.842
- Question is, what to do about it.
-You mean we should do something?

21:41.510 --> 21:43.720
Uh-- Why, yes, of course, madam.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.807
After all, we are citizens of Gotham City.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.935
Heaven knows Batman has done enough
for all of us in the past.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.479
Oh, more than enough.

21:52.687 --> 21:56.525
But what can we do
if Batman himself couldn't stop it?

21:56.691 --> 21:59.110
Well, we must try and think of something.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.697
Oh, I wish Bruce were here.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.534
I'm sure he could think of something.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.911
I'm not at all sure that he could.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.338
- I take it you're the best man?
-Yes.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.715
It's time for the groom.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.935
In case you've forgotten the ring,
Batman, I have six extras.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.979
I made a bargain and I'll stick to it.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.857
Anything is better than to let Robin
go through life the way he is.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.679
It's natural to be a little nervous, darling.

23:07.888 --> 23:10.891
Everyone is, the first time.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.310
Robin had better be all right.

23:13.518 --> 23:16.897
Oh, he's perfectly safe
as long as you cooperate.

23:17.105 --> 23:21.985
By the way, have you decided
where we're going to spend our honeymoon?

23:23.028 --> 23:25.780
Not a very cheerful groom, are you?

23:25.989 --> 23:29.576
I'll be perfectly happy to
spend my honeymoon in the Batcave.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.706
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

23:34.915 --> 23:38.001
<i>NARRATOR".
Batman, to become a henpecked husband?</i>

23:38.209 --> 23:42.631
<i>And Mrs. Batman,
Gotham City's arch-criminals?</i>

23:42.839 --> 23:46.009
Do you, Marsha, take this Batman
to be your lawful wedded husband?

23:46.217 --> 23:48.803
To love, honor, and obey
as long as you both shall live?

23:49.012 --> 23:50.430
I do.

23:50.639 --> 23:54.059
And do you, Batman, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

23:54.267 --> 23:58.229
To love, honor, and cherish
as long as you shall live?

23:59.356 --> 24:01.024
<i>I.</i>

24:02.859 --> 24:04.611
-I...
-Say, "I do."

24:06.363 --> 24:07.405
<i>l.</i>
