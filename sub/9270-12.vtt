00:01.200 --> 00:03.880
If it's true what they say...

00:06.240 --> 00:09.640
.. that you have the power
of life and death...

00:13.200 --> 00:15.200
.. I need your help.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.940
Ginnie!

00:23.840 --> 00:26.070
I didn't think that you'd come.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.080
Well, if I can help Freddie and
sort things out between us...

00:33.000 --> 00:34.910
You can't still be angry with me?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.910
~ I don't have eyes in the back of my head...
~ I trusted you.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.950
And now he's sick.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.500
What if he doesn't get
better? If he can't walk?

00:44.840 --> 00:47.180
God forbid, what if he d...

00:48.680 --> 00:52.180
Do you really think I'll
be able to forgive you?

00:52.960 --> 00:56.440
We'd better both pray the Standing
Stones live up to the myth.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.190
It's getting powerful round here now.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.840
And the closer it gets to Midsummer
Night, the stronger they are.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.830
I can feel it. Can you?

01:11.880 --> 01:14.160
Let's just get on with it.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.190
Did you bring the blood?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.310
No, I couldn't cut
him. You can use mine.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.670
I don't know if it'll
work with yours.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.990
And I haven't got a knife.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.430
Do you know the words?

01:36.760 --> 01:38.630
Give me your hand.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.150
Look,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.140
I should have said
this before, but...

02:01.440 --> 02:03.150
You're right.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.670
It WAS my fault.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.150
I'm sorry.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.199
I'd do anything to
turn back the clock.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.550
~ I think you should go.
~ No, Ginnie, I...

02:18.600 --> 02:21.590
~ I've changed my mind. Just go!
~ I want you to forgive me.
~ GO!

02:21.640 --> 02:23.580
FINE! Be like that.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.150
If Freddie does die,
don't come crying to me.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.510
It's not my fault your
son can't do as he's told.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.800
Huh!

03:05.560 --> 03:07.920
Sylvia Swann, 23, barmaid.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.310
Any ideas what lock this belongs to?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.590
We're about to try
her lodgings now, Sir.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.870
Any family?

03:17.920 --> 03:19.750
She turned up about a year ago.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.070
Got some work in the pub.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.350
This can't be anyone
from Standing, Sir.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.470
We stick together here. Specially
in times like these.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.750
What about the woman
who discovered her?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.350
Ginnie Godden?

03:32.400 --> 03:36.350
~ Why didn't she come to you first?
~ Well, she was in shock.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.630
She ran up to the
road, and collapsed.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.030
Lucky someone saw her -
she might've been next.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.870
Any connection to the deceased?

03:43.920 --> 03:47.200
They worked together behind
the bar. Best friends.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.110
Ginnie says she met Sylvia
here, they'd separated,

03:51.160 --> 03:53.670
then she heard a scream.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.910
A bit odd, isn't it, that
she didn't happen to see any

03:56.960 --> 03:59.110
of this murder or whoever
committed it.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.160
What were they doing
all the way out here?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.750
Collecting mushrooms.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.800
Mushrooms? By firelight?

04:09.200 --> 04:13.670
Well, it's certainly not
the sort of place you'd...

04:13.720 --> 04:16.149
happen to be passing.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.550
Inspector.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.920
I was on my way to Standing
and I saw your cars.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.270
~ God rest her soul.
~ It's Sylvia Swann.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.390
Thank you, PC Everett.

04:32.760 --> 04:36.060
I'd like you to leave
my crime scene, please.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.390
That's an interesting key.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.920
~ Sir!>
~ Now!

04:47.160 --> 04:48.760
What's that?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.120
Nothing.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.910
And I thought it was just straws
you grasped at Father,

05:00.960 --> 05:04.150
~ not sticks!
~ This is no stick.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.430
I know a young parishioner
who'd say it's

05:06.480 --> 05:09.390
the beginnings of a
rather fine catapult.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.320
Over here!>

05:15.280 --> 05:17.350
Well, that's curious.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.710
Is that blood?

05:24.880 --> 05:26.550
Sergeant!

05:26.600 --> 05:28.120
Yes, sir.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.830
Send a sample of this to
the laboratory in Oxford.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.190
I thought Mrs Godden said the first
she knew of Miss Swann's injury

05:40.240 --> 05:43.510
was when she heard
her scream over there.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.470
~ She did, Sir.
~ Then why is there blood here?

05:46.520 --> 05:50.110
More importantly, why didn't
Mrs Godden mention it?

05:50.160 --> 05:52.310
This story isn't adding up.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.030
Ginnie Godden?

05:56.120 --> 05:59.110
But she and Sylvia were best friends.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.230
Ginnie wouldn't have any
reason to hurt Sylvia.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.750
Would she?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.990
Late, as usual!

06:15.040 --> 06:17.310
Change of plan. We're not
going to the hospital.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.710
But what about the children?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.190
So I have come all this way...

06:21.240 --> 06:23.790
I've just come from
the Standing Stones.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.910
Sylvia Swann was killed
there last night.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.350
What? At the Stones?

06:30.400 --> 06:32.950
~ You don't think...
~ No, I don't.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.190
But you do know the legend -

06:35.240 --> 06:39.150
that one midsummer midnight,
77 stones got up

06:39.200 --> 06:42.630
and walked, converging
on a glade in the wood,

06:42.680 --> 06:45.830
aligning their entrance
to the midsummer moon.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.990
Yes. That is the legend.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.950
Yes, but they say that
on that one night,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.270
they have the power
over life and death.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.670
I've heard of folk praying to
the Stones to save the sick.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.150
Who's to say it only
works that way round?

07:03.200 --> 07:08.440
What if somebody prayed to the
Stones to have Sylvia killed?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.510
Mrs McCarthy...

07:12.560 --> 07:16.320
I know. I know. "Thou shalt not
have strange gods before me."

07:17.480 --> 07:20.680
Whoever it was was entirely human.

07:21.800 --> 07:27.310
Well, if we don't have to be
here, I'd sooner keep away.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.630
This is not a healthy place.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.480
If we were going to get it,
we'd have got it by now.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.430
There are other unsavoury
elements in Standing

07:36.480 --> 07:38.590
besides the polio, Father.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.040
Malcolm!

07:42.560 --> 07:44.150
Malcolm!

07:44.200 --> 07:48.190
Leave him be, Father. That
one will never see the light.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.110
Anyway, we haven't got time for this.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.830
We need to talk to Ginnie.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.920
Oh, no.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.230
With modern science, there
are tests we can do.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.670
If it's blood, we'll find out.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.110
All right, it's blood.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.030
But it's not Sylvia's. It's mine.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.909
And, er... how did it get there?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.870
I fell...

08:37.919 --> 08:41.350
and cut myself - I must've
leant on the stone.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.350
So why not say this at
the initial interview?

08:44.400 --> 08:47.110
Because I didn't think
it was important.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.310
Is this really appropriate?
Her son's very sick.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.230
Nurse Shipton, a woman's been killed.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.080
Niceties have to be set to one side.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.520
Ah, Freddie!

08:58.640 --> 09:01.630
Don't worry. We'll pump by hand.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.400
All day, if we have to.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.750
Oh, sweet Lord Jesus.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.720
SHE SOBS

09:23.200 --> 09:24.870
POWER RETURNS

09:33.600 --> 09:35.310
Nurse Shipton, I...

09:35.360 --> 09:36.750
I didn't realise.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.190
He's completely dependent
on the machine.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.070
If it stops, he dies.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.350
Tell Mrs Godden we can do
this down at the station.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.150
I don't intend to distress her son.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.590
It's the news of the murder,
more than anything.

09:49.640 --> 09:54.830
Sylvia sit... Used to sit with
Freddie when Ginnie had to work.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.950
He knew her well, then.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.910
We're creating a timeline
of her last hours.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.430
Did she sit with him yesterday?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.950
Ginnie wouldn't let her come.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.920
Inspector, we'd like
to speak to Mrs Godden.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.350
I thought they were best friends?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.190
Last week, Sylvia was supposed
to be watching Freddie,

10:18.240 --> 10:21.430
but he went off playing with
the neighbours' children.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.720
~ Then they fell ill...
~ That's how he caught the polio.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.500
Ginnie and Sylvia fell out over it.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.750
Badly.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.270
Did you know this?

10:37.320 --> 10:40.030
What were you thinking,
keeping it to yourself?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.470
This is a motive. Mrs Godden...

10:42.520 --> 10:44.550
Why didn't you say
you held Miss Swann

10:44.600 --> 10:47.190
responsible for your son's condition?

10:47.240 --> 10:52.310
Inspector, you're making a mistake.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.360
With the evidence as it
stands, I have no choice.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.950
Ginnie Godden, I am arresting
you on suspicion of the murder

11:00.000 --> 11:02.990
~ of Sylvia Swann.
~ No, you can't do this!

11:03.040 --> 11:05.750
Marjorie will sit with your
boy, every second you're away.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.510
You're not obliged to say anything,

11:07.560 --> 11:10.110
but anything you say will be
taken down in writing and may be

11:10.160 --> 11:12.030
given in evidence.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.920
No-one hurts my staff
and gets away with it.

11:17.880 --> 11:21.880
If you saw anything or anyone,
I'm begging you, come forward.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.950
None of that mumbo jumbo, am I clear?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.760
The only way stones can kill someone
is when somebody's holding them.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.350
Miss Swann was stabbed.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.870
I don't think we can
blame a stone for that.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.520
And the inspector's already
made an arrest. Ginnie Godden.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.550
~ That's nonsense! I'll go talk to him.
~ I'm glad you said that.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.990
I find it hard to believe
that Ginnie's a murderer.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.790
Also, I just came from
the cottage hospital.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.950
Little Mary Harris died this morning.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.110
~ What?
~ Another death. Just this morning.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.360
Make sure the children stop indoors.
I'll let you all get home.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.390
If you have any information
on Sylvia's murder,

12:07.440 --> 12:10.040
go see Walt at the police house.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.230
Oi! I live upstairs.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.400
The lavs are THAT way!

12:20.960 --> 12:22.240
Walt.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.870
~ Sid.
~ Ola!

12:38.920 --> 12:41.920
Fancy meeting you here.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.790
Returning lost property.
What's your excuse?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.670
Who loses a stick?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.110
More to the point, who
blinkin' well returns one?

12:52.160 --> 12:54.430
This is not just a stick.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.150
This is a hazel dowsing rod.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.160
It didn't just fall off a
tree and where I found it...

13:02.240 --> 13:04.510
There ARE no hazel trees.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.350
Out at the Stones.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.950
Where that murder
happened last night?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.670
~ You've heard?
~ Everyone's heard.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.040
Sid? What's all the...
Oh, Father Brown.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.510
I'm here to see Malcolm.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.750
I had no idea he was so popular.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.390
Malcolm's my... teacher.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.510
We're studying physical
energy together.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.230
~ First time I've heard it called that!
~ Ley lines, Sid.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.760
Dowsing. I do believe Sidney
thinks I'm having an affair.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.710
No-one would think that
of you, Lady Felicia.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.950
Quite. And in any case...

13:44.000 --> 13:47.230
Malcolm believes that with
purity comes strength.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.840
His chastity allows him to
commune with Higher Powers.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.310
The Father found Malcolm's
stick out at the Stones.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.710
He could have left it there any time.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.990
Anyone who believes in dowsing

14:03.040 --> 14:05.990
wouldn't let their rod
out of their sight.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.110
I saw him with this
around Kembleford...

14:10.160 --> 14:11.830
late yesterday.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.420
Hang about.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.510
So that means it was dropped
sometime between...

14:17.560 --> 14:20.150
then and this morning, which
means that Malcolm could be...

14:20.200 --> 14:21.670
~ A witness.
~ .. the killer.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.720
Felicia? What...?

14:29.840 --> 14:33.070
Is this what you were
looking for, earlier?

14:33.120 --> 14:35.070
Where did you find it?

14:35.120 --> 14:36.790
At the Stones.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
You were there last
night, weren't you?

14:41.880 --> 14:44.020
When Sylvia was killed?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.320
Stupid girl.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.430
Messing with what didn't concern her.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.750
And what exactly was that?

15:02.720 --> 15:04.990
Those stones are powerful.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.540
She should've known better.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.430
'What if Freddie dies?'

15:23.480 --> 15:26.270
If I'm not there with him, he'll
think I've abandoned him.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.950
The Father's working
tirelessly for your release.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.750
If there's anything you can tell
me, no matter how small...

15:33.800 --> 15:35.140
Ginnie.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.670
I've just come back from the meeting.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.190
The whole village knows,
they're all behind you.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.350
You have to do something.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.150
Listen, I'm going to
get you out of here.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.750
I'm still a Standing Bobby,
I've got influence.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.150
It's just wrong. Why
did Sylvia have to die?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.550
Hush, now.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.950
At this rate, you're going
to make yourself sick.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.950
Now, Marjorie's going
to take care of Freddie.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.750
If you need anything,
you let me know.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.750
I can reach you at any time.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.870
I want to see Freddie.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.520
Marjorie will be with him every
second of the day and night.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.470
Oh, now that PC Everett
is here, I'll be off.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.390
But if there's anything
else that I can do...

16:14.440 --> 16:16.640
Yes. Mrs McCarthy, wait.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.350
Would you go and sit
with my son, please?

16:19.400 --> 16:22.510
Well, PC Everett said Nurse
Marjorie will be with him.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.270
Marjorie's not Catholic.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.670
She doesn't understand last rites.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.110
I want someone there from
the church, just in case.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.310
Well, I am very busy, you know.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.870
But I suppose Lady Felicia
has time on her hands,

16:35.920 --> 16:38.310
so I will make sure that
one or other of us

16:38.360 --> 16:40.750
is with him at all times.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.270
Thank you.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.390
Where did you find it?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.230
I was dowsing near the Stones.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.550
It's the most powerful
time of the year.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.990
I was searching for strength
and it lead me to... that.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.630
And?

16:58.680 --> 17:02.600
And then I heard the police bells,
and I realised it was time I left.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.310
Must've dropped the rod as I went.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.829
Did you see anybody? Anything?

17:14.240 --> 17:16.390
We're going to hand it in.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.829
They'll hang, draw and quarter him!

17:18.880 --> 17:21.150
Malcolm didn't have to show
us the knife, he chose to.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.750
That is not the mark of a guilty man.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.200
Are your fingerprints on it?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.110
I was wearing gloves.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.510
I'll tell them it was
found at the church.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.150
In return, anything you find,

17:35.200 --> 17:37.230
make sure you bring it to me.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.950
I WILL get to the bottom of this.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.110
You don't believe all
that guff, do you?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.670
I believe in innocent
until proven guilty.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.790
Oddball does not equal murderer...

17:59.840 --> 18:02.630
or they'd have arrested me.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.430
A bloody murder weapon
present at the scene.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.710
Admittedly no motive, apart
from being a nutter, but...

18:08.760 --> 18:10.150
I'll keep digging.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.200
Meanwhile, the police
can run their tests.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.920
I suspect that this is
what will interest them.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.710
Just in here, sir.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.990
Father.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.710
So... where's this murder weapon?

18:46.760 --> 18:49.110
I took the liberty
of asking the barmaid

18:49.160 --> 18:50.790
to bring out a kitchen knife.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.950
This is the one she brought,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.430
this is the one left at St Mary's.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.110
Identical.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.760
Apart from the blood, of course.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.470
What's going on?

19:03.520 --> 19:07.240
Father Brown's handing over some
rather interesting evidence.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.310
Sergeant, does the key
in that lock match the one

19:13.360 --> 19:16.100
that was found round Sylvia's neck?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.510
You need a search warrant for that.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.070
I can get one.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.150
See if your home's
any more forthcoming.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.040
I'm expecting to learn that Sylvia
had her own key to your lodgings.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.720
If there's something more to
say, I suggest you tell it now.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.950
Father.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.740
All right, yes.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.560
Sylv and me, we had
something going on.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.750
Sylvia was pregnant.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.430
Presumably she wanted
you to marry her.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.880
How did you feel about that?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.430
I wasn't happy about it.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.070
I didn't kill her.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.510
We'll see what the pros
sols think about that.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.550
No, we won't.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.630
~ I've got an alibi.
~ Really?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.710
Ask anyone.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.710
HE SMIRKS

20:21.760 --> 20:22.750
Anyone?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.710
We're in an epidemic.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.190
Folks are taking shifts at the
cottage hospital, round the clock.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.600
I was there most of last night,
along with half the village.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.000
~ We'll check that out.
~ Be my guest.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.590
Isn't this is where you're
supposed to reveal

20:44.640 --> 20:46.980
that Malcolm had the knife?

20:47.760 --> 20:51.060
You're going to regret
covering for that man.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.470
KNOCK AT DOOR

20:55.520 --> 20:57.000
Come!

21:01.880 --> 21:05.120
The villagers who can corroborate
Mr Gastrell's alibi.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.710
But YOU are on this list.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.750
You were at the hospital last night?

21:18.800 --> 21:21.350
Alf can't be the killer.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.400
Inspector, the
fingerprints on the knife.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.110
Two sets of prints on the handle.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.150
The victim's and Mrs Godden's.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.510
No, wait a minute.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.630
The knife came from the pub,
she worked in the pub.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.470
Of course her prints
could be on the knife.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.630
The blood trail suggests Mrs Godden
lied about where she found the body.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.830
Her prints are on the murder weapon.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.000
And we know she held Miss Swann
responsible for her son's illness.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.070
He's close to death.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.460
Means, motive, opportunity.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.870
Inspector, please, I
need to be with my son.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.510
That won't be possible.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.960
Sergeant, get a search
warrant for her cottage.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.260
We're charging you with murder.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.880
Apparently I'm supposed
to talk to you.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.700
I don't know why Mrs
McCarthy sent me.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.110
I'd be no help if you did wake up.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.590
Children and I, we're like...

22:40.240 --> 22:42.510
.. a fish with golf clubs.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.270
As Monty will attest.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.870
Give me a thoroughbred any day.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.390
SHE GASPS

22:51.160 --> 22:53.630
Goodness. You gave me a start.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.190
Peepo.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.660
Peep... Oh!

23:06.320 --> 23:08.430
~ Where's Father Brown?
~ I don't know.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.790
I think I know what
happened. To Sylvia.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.190
~ I think it might happen again.
~ What? Why?

23:13.240 --> 23:14.910
Father Brown will understand.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.560
Help me find him for me? Please!

23:20.360 --> 23:21.790
Blast!

23:21.840 --> 23:23.430
Someone's got here before us.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.950
This warrant's not worth
the paper it's printed on.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.740
~ Put it out, cover it up.
~ Yes, sir.

23:31.760 --> 23:32.910
What are you doing?

23:32.960 --> 23:35.790
I have the same question
for you. Burning evidence.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.790
Burning Freddie's things.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.510
This is polio we're dealing with.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.990
Is there a problem, Inspector?

23:48.040 --> 23:51.190
I might've known you'd get
here before us, Father.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.910
Clean clothes.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.550
Ginnie will need them until
you see the error of your ways

23:55.600 --> 23:56.790
and let her go.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.070
The whole village agrees.
Ginnie didn't kill anyone.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.230
We want you to set her free.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.670
I'm with them, sir. Her son's sick.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.920
She's at breaking point.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.300
Did you want something, PC Everett?

24:12.600 --> 24:15.900
The autopsy results for
Sylvia Swann are back.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.510
Maybe it's just as well
you're here, after all.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.550
I asked the coroner to discover
how far her pregnancy was.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.790
What he's told me is
she wasn't pregnant.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.750
What?

24:32.800 --> 24:34.470
CAR HORN BEEPS

24:37.040 --> 24:38.780
Father, hop in.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.080
~ Um...
~ I need to take you somewhere.
It's important. Please.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.460
~ BANGING ON DOOR
~ Hello!

24:50.800 --> 24:52.940
Somebody, listen to me!

24:57.480 --> 24:59.190
I need to make a confession.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.310
Constable, find the Inspector - now.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.660
Not a police confession.
I need Father Brown.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.030
Hello?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.200
I thought you said he was
going to meet us here.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.030
He's gone ahead... to the Stones.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.550
He says to read from page 79.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.830
"Sacrifice and the Stones."
It talks about healing.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.960
It says, "the only way to
save innocent human lives...

25:44.160 --> 25:47.360
".. is to give another
innocent human life."

25:48.720 --> 25:51.510
So someone wanted to save
the village children

25:51.560 --> 25:54.870
from this frightful epidemic
and made Sylvia the sacrifice -

25:54.920 --> 25:56.990
killing the one to save the many.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.440
Except that, by all accounts, no-one
thought Sylvia Swann was innocent.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.910
Maybe not Sylvia.

26:04.320 --> 26:07.350
But definitely her unborn child.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.560
Well, then we need to find out who
else knew about Sylvia's pregnancy.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.310
Because whoever it is...

26:14.360 --> 26:16.430
is going to try again.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.420
Father, you're needed
at the station. M'Lady.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.150
Thank God, Father.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.040
I see. I see.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.830
Mrs Morris' what?

26:41.160 --> 26:43.790
Oh, Mrs Morris' dog!

26:43.840 --> 26:45.310
I'll make a note.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.230
Yeah, goodbye.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.910
Father.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.990
I'm here to see Ginnie Godden.

26:51.040 --> 26:54.040
Mrs Godden, I've got
the Father here...

27:00.480 --> 27:04.360
Listen, Alf. If my girlfriend
got herself pregnant...

27:05.360 --> 27:09.870
.. I can think of a couple of people
I might want to get on the blower.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.750
I might have mentioned
it to Nurse Shipton

27:12.800 --> 27:18.070
to see if she knew anyone who might...
help with the situation.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.510
~ But she gave me short shrift.
~ Anyone else?

27:20.560 --> 27:22.950
That oddball, the herbalist.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.910
I thought he might know some plants
that could solve our problem.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.270
Though why he would, when
he takes great pleasure

27:29.320 --> 27:31.590
in telling the world he's
pure as the driven...

27:31.640 --> 27:34.950
You told Malcolm Sylvia was pregnant?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.560
PHONE RINGS

27:38.400 --> 27:40.270

Father Brown, for you.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.790
Felicia speaking.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.270
Oh, no.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.830
No.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.030
~ Ginnie Godden's in hospital.
~ What?!

27:55.080 --> 27:57.030
Attempted suicide.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.470
She tried to hang herself.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.470
But why?

28:01.520 --> 28:04.750
Guilty conscience. Maybe she
did kill Sylvia after all.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.110
Who knows? It's the boy I
feel sorry for. Poor lad.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.150
~ What's going to happen to him now?
~ Father, listen...

28:11.200 --> 28:14.140
Malcolm knew about
Sylvia's pregnancy.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.790
What if I was wrong?

28:16.840 --> 28:20.390
If it was him all along
deliberately trying to mislead us.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.630
What if he came to the hospital,
not trying to find me

28:23.680 --> 28:26.670
but looking for another
innocent sacrifice?

28:26.720 --> 28:27.990
'It's getting dark soon.'

28:28.040 --> 28:31.550
If anything will be happening,
it'll be happening at midnight.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.390
I wonder if you could send Sid
to meet me at the police station,

28:34.440 --> 28:36.110
we'll go straight to the Stones.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.750
Then, perhaps, you go
to the cottage hospital

28:38.800 --> 28:41.950
and make sure the children
are safe. Goodbye.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.860
~ So what's the plan?
~ No idea.
~ Brilliant.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.190
~ Tell me everything. When
was the last time he...?
~ Sh!

29:23.240 --> 29:24.990
(When was the last time he was seen?)

29:25.040 --> 29:27.430
Ah, so you didn't get our message.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.350
Of course we did. That's
why we're here.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.990
No, the second message.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.870
Inspector...

29:32.920 --> 29:35.710
It turns out his breathing
improved so much

29:35.760 --> 29:37.830
they took him off the iron lung.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.350
Well, they needed it
for another child.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.870
You didn't think to ascertain
this before you called us?

29:42.920 --> 29:44.830
I'm sorry, Inspector
- we really thought...

29:44.880 --> 29:47.070
Time was of the essence.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.030
Stand down, men. Go
home to your families.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.910
It's about time we called it a day.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.950
Well, what about Father Brown?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.310
He's out in the back of beyond
in the middle of the night.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.550
It'll give him time to reflect
on the repercussions

29:59.600 --> 30:01.470
of his wild accusations.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.030
My bicycle's outside,
I'll go and find him.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.270
We don't need any more accidents.

30:06.320 --> 30:10.320
Unless there are any more
innocents you need me to save?

30:19.640 --> 30:21.550
GROUP: Fowles in the frith,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.550
The fishes in the flood,

30:23.600 --> 30:24.710
And I mon wax wood...

30:24.760 --> 30:26.470
How many of them are there?!

30:26.520 --> 30:30.070
The prospect of saving
all the village's children

30:30.120 --> 30:32.030
is very promising.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.630
Yeah, but to kill
a kid to save a kid?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.550
That doesn't make any sense.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.950
Can you make out which one's Malcolm?

30:38.000 --> 30:41.160
Yes, and they are not
sacrificing a child.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.990
Right - so what're we going to do?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.590
Two of us against all of them?

30:45.640 --> 30:49.310
Well, I have asked
Sergeant Goodfellow

30:49.360 --> 30:50.630
to alert Inspector Sullivan.

30:50.680 --> 30:54.180
Yeah, but if he was coming,
he'd be here by now.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.710
You go in the car and get some help.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.950
What about you?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.140
I'll think of something

31:14.320 --> 31:15.860
PHONE RINGS

31:19.040 --> 31:20.880
Kembleford 769.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.270
Yes. Yes, he does house calls,

31:25.320 --> 31:28.320
but you'll need to
call the presbytery.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.830
Let me get this straight,

31:31.880 --> 31:34.550
he's not answering the telephone?

31:38.840 --> 31:42.470
"I will fear no evils,
for thou art with me.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.620
"Thy rod and thy staff,
have comforted me."

31:51.960 --> 31:54.030
The Police. Thank you.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.990
GROUP CONTINUE RITUAL

32:06.800 --> 32:08.070
(Walt!

32:09.230 --> 32:10.230
(No...)

32:10.280 --> 32:12.470
Silence!

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
Midnight approaches.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.500
GROUP: Much sorwe I walke with.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.670
The Solstice begins.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.920
Much sorwe I walke with.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.740
Is the knife sharpened?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.830
Is the knife-bearer ready?

32:33.280 --> 32:35.640
Is the knife-bearer ready?

32:45.840 --> 32:47.630
(We need you to be ready.)

32:47.680 --> 32:49.790
Are you SURE, this time?

32:49.840 --> 32:52.030
It didn't work before.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.910
Because that was the wrong sacrifice.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.760
This is perfect.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.460
~ And what if...?
~ What if we do nothing?

33:00.040 --> 33:02.590
How many more children have to die?

33:02.640 --> 33:06.710
You told me yourself, you couldn't
bear another child dying young

33:06.760 --> 33:09.100
~ or living maimed!
~ I can't.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.270
Then you know what you have to do.

33:12.960 --> 33:16.350
This is the last death
you need to see.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.470
Everything is in alignment.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.460
It was meant to be.

33:22.280 --> 33:25.280
We're going to be
successful this time.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.280
Word of warning. The priest's about.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.430
Just the priest?

33:37.480 --> 33:39.150
HE CHUCKLES

33:39.200 --> 33:41.470
I think we can handle him.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.750
Is the knife-bearer ready?

33:49.800 --> 33:51.140
She is.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.390
Midnight... begin!

33:55.440 --> 33:56.580
No!

33:59.800 --> 34:02.340
CHUCKLING: Father Brown. Alone?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.909
Don't worry, Malcolm.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.270
They won't kill you.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.750
No cavalry?

34:12.800 --> 34:15.270
How are you going to stop us?

34:18.199 --> 34:20.800
By offering myself in his place.

34:22.199 --> 34:25.199
If you want to sacrifice
an innocent...

34:25.679 --> 34:27.670
.. sacrifice me.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.030
Sergeant, you have
to call the inspector.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.070
I don't care if you wake him up!

34:33.120 --> 34:36.710
The Father went out to
the Stones tonight and...

34:36.760 --> 34:39.150
Would you just be quiet
for one minute?!

34:39.199 --> 34:42.440
He went out and it looks like
he's never made his way back.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.550
No, he cannot be out on a call!

34:46.600 --> 34:49.719
His pyx bag is here on
the table in front of me.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.390
You said you'd let him free.

34:58.440 --> 34:59.710
Later.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.430
We don't want anyone raising
the alarm before we're finished.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.190
This can't be interrupted.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.340
You think peace and
quiet makes it work?

35:08.720 --> 35:12.360
You were right. We didn't get
a true innocent last time.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.350
This time will be different.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.830
Exactly the same.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.680
Another death...

35:21.400 --> 35:24.000
.. and no lives given in return.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.070
We'll see about that.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.750
Is that how you think it works?

35:31.800 --> 35:33.790
It's what you believe, isn't it?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.590
Jesus sacrificed himself
for our sins.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.390
You preach it every Sunday.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.440
Our Gods are just a
bit more... useful.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.230
If you think you'll
be able to convert us,

35:45.280 --> 35:47.430
you've got the wrong men.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.030
Marjorie...

35:50.080 --> 35:51.790
you had a strong faith.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.870
And then I saw child after child die,

35:54.920 --> 35:56.390
or live maimed.

35:56.440 --> 36:01.270
I prayed and I prayed, but if your
Christian God won't save them,

36:01.320 --> 36:03.150
I want no part of him.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.670
We need to save our children.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.790
That's not quite true of
you, Alf, though, is it?

36:08.840 --> 36:12.270
Convenient - get rid
of a pregnant girlfriend

36:12.320 --> 36:14.790
you were tired of, wasn't it?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.150
And Freddie?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.470
No-one's done anything to Freddie.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.720
Yet.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.390
Mrs McCarthy was very impressed
with Walt's support for Ginnie

36:28.440 --> 36:30.670
when she was in custody...

36:30.720 --> 36:32.990
promising you'd be
with her little boy

36:33.040 --> 36:35.840
"every second of the night and day."

36:36.720 --> 36:40.840
With hindsight, that sounds like
a threat, wouldn't you say?

36:43.480 --> 36:45.020
That's low.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.000
Very low.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.200
Even if he did say all
that, it's just words.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.870
~ And Ginnie.
~ Ginnie did that to herself.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.110
Is that what you think?

37:01.160 --> 37:04.030
I think someone tried to shut her up.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.110
And after tonight,

37:07.160 --> 37:09.230
I think they'll try again.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.070
Ginnie was one of us.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.950
Why would we kill her?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.630
She brought Sylvia here.

37:14.680 --> 37:17.190
But she didn't have the strength
to follow it through.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.710
I won't be like that.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.350
And Sylvia.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.340
Killed for nothing.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.870
And now me.

37:25.920 --> 37:29.640
What if I'm killed
and nothing changes?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.310
And Sid's missing, too.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.030
Hornby had to bring me
over in Monty's car.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.070
What do we do?

37:40.120 --> 37:41.830
Sid!

37:41.880 --> 37:43.070
Call the police.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.590
~ Do you think I haven't tried?
~ And Freddie's safe.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.710
But Malcolm isn't. He's
about to be sacrificed.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.710
~ What?
~ And Father Brown's out there by himself.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.920
~ Well, let's go.
~ OK.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.440
Operator? Kembleford
Police Station, please.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.760
Not losing your bottle, are you?

38:03.760 --> 38:05.160
Gag him.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.620
SLICING

38:25.600 --> 38:27.270
We need blood.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.100
It's on me.

38:39.120 --> 38:42.150
As his lifeblood drains...

38:42.200 --> 38:45.030
with our eyes closed...

38:45.080 --> 38:47.680
we perform our final chant.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.950
Fowles in the frith!

38:51.000 --> 38:55.790
The fishes in the flood!

38:55.840 --> 38:58.150
GROUP: And I mon wax wood,

38:58.200 --> 39:00.550
Much sorwe I walke with...

39:00.600 --> 39:02.400
RITUAL CONTINUES

39:15.440 --> 39:17.030
This is her blood!

39:17.080 --> 39:18.950
She's betrayed us.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.350
Go after him. Shut him up.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.110
What about the sacrifice?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.870
We've run out of time.

39:24.920 --> 39:28.020
This dried-up old spinster
will have to do.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.120
Not far now.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.510
Who's that?

39:37.560 --> 39:40.870
The police! Oh, thank God.
Where's Father Brown?

39:40.920 --> 39:43.030
He's... up ahead.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.910
We caught them off-guard.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.390
~ Lady Felicia, is your car nearby?
~ Just down the track.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.310
Could I borrow it?
I'll go and find him.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.510
~ Oh, of course. Sid, the keys.
~ Stop! Police!

39:51.560 --> 39:54.270
Hey, it's all right, Inspector.
I've broken it up.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.390
Everybody's safe now.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.390
Thank you, PC Everett.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.030
All right, men, stand down.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.750
Father Brown!

40:03.160 --> 40:04.830
He's one of Sylvia's killers.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.910
What?!

40:05.960 --> 40:08.560
~ Quick! Get after him!
~ Yes, sir.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.140
What do you mean, "one of"?

40:13.960 --> 40:16.160
Much sorwe I walke with.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.440
Are you really going to stand
there and watch this?

40:22.080 --> 40:24.350
Is this what it's come to?

40:25.800 --> 40:28.230
Josaphat?

40:28.280 --> 40:29.550
Simon?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.520
Much sorwe I walke with.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.990
Moira?

40:38.440 --> 40:39.960
Katherine?

40:45.280 --> 40:48.220
They've followed you
blindly this far.

40:48.640 --> 40:52.110
They won't follow you over the abyss.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.070
Cowards!

40:54.120 --> 40:56.190
COWARDS!

40:56.240 --> 40:57.710
HE GROANS

41:01.200 --> 41:04.910
No more pointless deaths.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.680
WHISTLE BLOWS

41:08.360 --> 41:09.830
No more.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.550
WHISTLE BLOWS

41:13.080 --> 41:15.120
Malcolm!

41:26.320 --> 41:28.790
Father, I wasn't expecting...

41:32.080 --> 41:34.790
Something from Mrs McCarthy's garden.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.440
(Thank you.)

41:37.360 --> 41:40.510
I thought if you came at all, you'd
be bringing the police with you.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.270
You backed out of Sylvia's sacrifice.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.030
You were prepared to tell all.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.550
It's not your fault
that Walt got to you.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.350
But I agreed to the plan
in the first place.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.910
I lured Sylvia out
there to her death.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.270
I was just so desperate.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.420
Standing was a village
of desperate people.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.150
We're just grateful for the
chance to return to normal.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.110
Not that the publican
or the policeman

42:04.160 --> 42:06.550
will be returning any time soon.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.950
Well, at least the polio's
burnt itself out.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.790
No new cases for the last seven days.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.430
Thanks to the Father.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.150
Nonsense. Nothing to do with me.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.710
If I'd just read on a few
more pages, I'd have known.

42:19.760 --> 42:23.630
The only thing more powerful than
an innocent being sacrificed

42:23.680 --> 42:26.190
is an innocent who is willing to be.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.790
Though I wasn't willing
to die for them...

42:29.840 --> 42:33.510
because not for a minute did I think
that it would have an effect.

42:33.560 --> 42:34.880
So...

42:36.760 --> 42:38.230
Malcolm...

42:39.520 --> 42:42.120
.. I was willing to die for YOU.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.920
Every time I see him,
I can't believe it.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.670
Thank you so much for letting
him stay while he recuperated.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.470
Oh, it's nothing.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.190
That's what the staff
are for, after all.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.990
I'm sure Lady Felicia will be
glad of the peace and quiet.

43:12.040 --> 43:14.190
Precisely what I was thinking.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.710
I was saying to Monty
only last night -

43:16.760 --> 43:19.030
if the past few weeks
have shown me anything,

43:19.080 --> 43:22.380
it's how glad I am that
we never had children.

43:27.640 --> 43:31.480
So... are you ready
to take your son home?
