WEBVTT

00:07.411 --> 00:08.611
Ew.

00:08.617 --> 00:09.916
It's the Yellow Pages.

00:10.128 --> 00:11.737
I know. That's what the "ew" was for.

00:11.743 --> 00:13.237
It's stupid and it's ugly and I hate.

00:13.243 --> 00:15.557
I'm in here. Under "Gilded Lotus."

00:15.563 --> 00:18.739
- Ooh, Gilded Lotus.
- It's the name of my business.

00:18.745 --> 00:20.814
It sounds like a vagina-piercing place.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.901
No, it doesn't. It's a
play on "gilding the lily."

00:23.907 --> 00:25.712
So why didn't you just
call it "Gilded Lily"?

00:25.718 --> 00:27.103
Because that name was taken.

00:28.017 --> 00:29.407
By a vagina-piercing place.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.691
You know, when I'm
interested in hiring someone,

00:31.697 --> 00:34.482
- the first thing I do is I get the phone book...
- Yeah.

00:34.488 --> 00:36.082
- and if their name is in here...
- Right?

00:36.088 --> 00:38.503
I don't hire them. It's 2019.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.790
It's all about branding
yourself on social media.

00:40.796 --> 00:43.438
It just so happens I'm in
a ton of Facebook groups.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.735
And I tweet up a storm.
I am on Instagram.

00:46.741 --> 00:48.932
You have 14 followers.

00:48.938 --> 00:51.424
It's not about quantity.
It's about quality.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.882
No, it's about quantity. You're wrong.

00:54.366 --> 00:56.571
Oh god, yeah, e-even
Mae doesn't follow you.

00:56.577 --> 00:59.382
- Mae is a tough nut to crack...
- She follows Arthur.

01:00.686 --> 01:03.097
Okay, don't worry. I'm gonna help you.

01:03.103 --> 01:07.120
If you want your business to blow
up, you have to project success.

01:07.126 --> 01:09.988
- Are you suggesting...
- I think we should buy you some followers.

01:09.994 --> 01:11.417
You can Venmo me back.

01:11.932 --> 01:14.834
I don't have that. I
can write you a check.

01:42.042 --> 01:44.153
Did you say utilities were included?

01:44.159 --> 01:47.120
Yep. And the best part is...

01:47.657 --> 01:49.364
lint time!

You never know what you're

01:55.513 --> 01:57.454
Wow. 25 cents.

01:57.556 --> 01:59.841
You know, just because I
live in the laundry room,

01:59.847 --> 02:02.437
don't expect me to fold
everyone else's clothes.

02:02.443 --> 02:04.068
Learning a trade would be good for you.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.982
Hey, hey! I-I'll take that.

02:07.988 --> 02:10.770
Easy, buddy. What's up
with you and the turtle?

02:10.776 --> 02:13.177
Gee, I don't know. What's
up with you and my mom?

02:14.169 --> 02:15.583
Excuse me? What...

02:15.880 --> 02:17.540
Hey, is everything okay?

02:17.546 --> 02:20.155
Hmm? Is this about the laundry?
Because you don't have to really do it.

02:20.161 --> 02:21.835
It ain't about the laundry.

02:22.113 --> 02:24.373
It's just I don't like prying questions.

02:24.379 --> 02:26.700
And I can see that you don't, either.

02:26.706 --> 02:28.411
So let's just remember that.

02:30.981 --> 02:34.376
Hey, you guys, it's Tamryn
Tomas Vandaloo... TTV.

02:34.493 --> 02:37.499
You guys, is this mole growing?

02:38.711 --> 02:41.176
It's like, "Seriously,
mole? Right now, mole?

02:41.182 --> 02:42.491
You're gonna do this?"

02:42.497 --> 02:45.566
Anyway, I am currently in my
daughter Rabbit's playroom,

02:45.572 --> 02:47.856
and, as you can see, it's really gross

02:47.862 --> 02:49.350
and she never, ever wants to be here.

02:49.356 --> 02:51.658
Does anyone have any pro tips?

02:52.056 --> 02:53.276
"Chair swing.

02:54.369 --> 02:58.335
Massive wall decal with
shelves you can climb.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.614
Hey. You guys grammin'?

03:03.620 --> 03:05.030
Are you just lurkin'?

03:05.036 --> 03:06.636
I used to be a lurker m'self.

03:06.842 --> 03:09.762
Hey, there's a lotta new
content on my page these days.

03:09.768 --> 03:11.068

03:12.683 --> 03:13.958
Oh, schnapp!

03:13.964 --> 03:17.267
Mom's blowin' up! I just
got a reply from TTV.

03:17.369 --> 03:21.272
Stop it. Mason, she loves my
ideas. She wants to discuss.

03:21.651 --> 03:23.565
TTV! So cool.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.552
- Sounds like a bot.
- You're a bot.

03:28.744 --> 03:30.861
- Lena. We have a problem.
- Hey.

03:31.130 --> 03:32.711
I found this in Milo's book bag.

03:32.717 --> 03:35.312
It's the Room Mom sign-up sheet.

03:35.318 --> 03:37.620
Oh, I-I don't think I
can do that this year.

03:37.626 --> 03:39.438
I'm trying to get my
business off the ground.

03:39.444 --> 03:41.131
Oh, yeah. Pink Lotus.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.691
- Gilded Lotus. I'm changing it.
- Oh.

03:43.697 --> 03:45.722
What, are you gonna hang
up your Room Mom Keds?

03:45.728 --> 03:47.018
Turning in your glue gun?

03:47.024 --> 03:50.105
Between Mae, Mason, and the
last four years with Milo,

03:50.111 --> 03:52.222
I've been Room Mom for over a decade.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.122
Come on. You're not seriously

03:55.128 --> 03:56.820
- gonna make me feel bad about this.
- No, no, no...

03:56.826 --> 03:59.808
I'm not trying to make you feel
guilty. I swear it. I-I just...

04:00.210 --> 04:01.706
I'm worried about Milo...

04:01.712 --> 04:04.013
you know? I don't know if it's
a delayed reaction to the divorce

04:04.019 --> 04:07.057
or it's because we've moved
him into the laundry room,

04:07.346 --> 04:09.456
but the kid is just not himself.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.659
Hey! It looks great in here.

04:12.665 --> 04:14.649
Yeah, I love what you've
done with the place, bud.

04:14.771 --> 04:15.971
Oh!

04:17.048 --> 04:19.406
- Oh, thank you for that.
- No problem.

04:19.411 --> 04:21.809
So, um..

04:22.052 --> 04:25.458
it looks like I'm not gonna be
able to be Room Mom this year.

04:25.464 --> 04:27.442
That's fine. I know women everywhere

04:27.448 --> 04:29.966
are counting on you for
their hysterectomies.

04:29.972 --> 04:31.918
Okay, that's not what I do.

04:31.924 --> 04:33.209
- Oh, no?
- No.

04:33.215 --> 04:37.317
I want to help people by
decorating their houses.

04:37.323 --> 04:39.598
Oh, well, that's also important work.

04:39.604 --> 04:41.921
But I wanna make sure
you don't feel neglected.

04:41.927 --> 04:45.263
On the contrary. Don't worry
about me. Please. Carry on.

04:46.897 --> 04:48.097
Ah.

04:48.286 --> 04:50.465
Oh, okay. Maybe...

04:50.471 --> 04:53.475
- there's a way I can figure out how to...
- Ask me to be Room Mom?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.165
No need. I am on it! I'm in!

04:56.171 --> 04:58.263
You're not exactly Room Mom material...

04:58.269 --> 05:01.320
No, I am not, son. I
am Room Dad material.

05:01.326 --> 05:04.609
I'm gonna dad that room until
it forgets it even had a mom.

05:05.310 --> 05:07.711
- Really, Martin? Are you sure?
- Yes.

05:07.919 --> 05:10.416
Yeah, you know what? It's my turn, okay?

05:10.422 --> 05:14.543
I-I-it was probably my turn
a lot of turns ago, so...

05:15.237 --> 05:17.949
I feel like I want to
hug you. Can I hug you?

05:17.955 --> 05:20.347
I'm not in the business
of turning down hugs.

Hi!

06:01.542 --> 06:02.927
Rabbit always wanted a rabbit,

06:02.933 --> 06:06.232
but we were worried it was
gonna be just super confusing,

06:06.238 --> 06:07.834

for your modern aesthetic,

but this playroom needs a serious
dose of warmth and playfulness.

06:47.055 --> 06:50.423
I'm picturing a woodland wonderland,

06:50.429 --> 06:51.802
where the centerpiece

06:51.808 --> 06:55.303
is a giant tree with a hollow center
that doubles as a reading nook,

07:25.654 --> 07:29.354
Oh, helping out with special
projects, overseeing hot lunch.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.167
Oh, and putting together

07:31.173 --> 07:34.321
- our upcoming 100 Days of School party.

07:34.327 --> 07:37.501
- You actually get to help choose the theme.
- Hmm. Oh, okay.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.928
Let's see... Hollywood Nights!

07:39.934 --> 07:43.046
Ooh. How about "Black Panther"?

08:09.982 --> 08:11.965
I-I don't know anything.

08:11.971 --> 08:14.368
I'm the Room Dad. You can talk to me.

08:14.564 --> 08:15.857
I'm too scared.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.163
Scared of what?

08:18.361 --> 08:19.666
Milo.

08:26.243 --> 08:27.848
It's crazy!

08:27.854 --> 08:30.955
Did you hear the rumor that she
dated both Property Brothers?

08:30.961 --> 08:33.756
Everybody heard. She made sure of that.

08:34.061 --> 08:37.164
I don't think I've ever
seen this side before.

08:37.171 --> 08:39.759
- What side?
- You're jealous.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.184
Jealous?

08:44.640 --> 08:47.517
Ooh, you even have a
weird jealous laugh.

08:47.523 --> 08:49.342
I thought you'd be happy for me.

08:49.348 --> 08:50.755
I am happy for you.

08:50.879 --> 08:53.164
- I'm practically elated.
- Ha!

08:54.870 --> 08:56.168
Okay, look,

08:56.174 --> 08:59.185
it's just that I've seen
the way that she operates.

08:59.191 --> 09:01.860
She'll chew you up, she'll
suck out all your content,

09:01.866 --> 09:05.365
and she'll leave you on the side
of the road, gasping for air.

09:05.371 --> 09:07.555
TTV is supportive.

09:07.561 --> 09:09.962
Whereas you made fun of my Yellow Pages.

09:09.968 --> 09:14.389
I bought you followers,
okay? I accepted a check.

09:14.782 --> 09:16.188
I didn't even know I could do that.

09:16.194 --> 09:19.065
TTV accepts me for who I am.

09:19.071 --> 09:22.271
No. She exploits you for who you are.

09:22.868 --> 09:25.736
For Tamryn, this is
just about her increasing

09:25.742 --> 09:28.039
her female followers, okay?

09:28.045 --> 09:30.141
This is not about your design skills.

09:30.147 --> 09:34.119
You're wrong. She hired
me to design her playroom.

09:34.256 --> 09:37.267
Our relationship is
based on mutual respect

09:37.273 --> 09:40.243

10:09.840 --> 10:11.130
Are you a bully?

10:11.136 --> 10:13.529
A bully? Quite the opposite.

10:13.535 --> 10:17.397
Roger was just repaying a few bucks
I loaned him on the bake sale day.

10:17.582 --> 10:18.782
He's a good kid.

10:18.788 --> 10:21.274
Hey, boss. This guy bothering you?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.110
Whoa. Didn't know the
school was K through...

10:24.116 --> 10:26.289
- 30.
- I'm a sixth grader.

10:26.295 --> 10:28.586
It's cool, Owen. This is my dad.

10:29.163 --> 10:30.688
Copy that, boss.

10:36.998 --> 10:40.843
Ah, can I just have all the wine?

10:40.849 --> 10:43.734
Can I have all the wine, please?

10:43.740 --> 10:46.422
Ugh! You even sound like her.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.328
Well, maybe that's why
I had a follow spike.

10:48.334 --> 10:51.529
Baby's first follow spike. 16,000!

10:51.535 --> 10:52.810
Did you see?

10:52.816 --> 10:55.310
I think it's 'cause she
tags me in everything.

10:55.316 --> 10:58.318
Actually, 5,000 of those
followers are from me.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.524
Thank you.

11:00.118 --> 11:04.111
But actually, I don't think
we even needed to buy them.

11:04.117 --> 11:06.531
I'm just... I feel so blessed

11:06.537 --> 11:10.814
to be working with an
influencer who is so influential.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.120
Hmm.

11:12.126 --> 11:15.257
- So how's that playroom coming along?
- Hmm?

11:15.747 --> 11:18.417
The job she actually hired you to do?

11:18.628 --> 11:20.237
Designing the playroom?

11:20.243 --> 11:22.399
Totally. So crazy!

11:22.405 --> 11:24.915
She boomeranged our Vom
Straws, and it went viral.

11:24.921 --> 11:26.798
Look at how many views!

11:26.804 --> 11:29.085
Mm. No, thanks.

11:29.673 --> 11:31.063
Where are you going?

11:31.069 --> 11:33.173
Well, you said you wanted all the wine.

11:34.378 --> 11:35.649
It's all yours!

11:35.655 --> 11:36.954
I should story this.

11:39.663 --> 11:40.876
Wait.

11:47.260 --> 11:50.270
Good morning, Ms. David. Uh, I
just wanted to grab a quick word

11:50.276 --> 11:52.082
- before class. Hi.
- There he is!

11:52.088 --> 11:53.990
Our Room Baba.

11:53.996 --> 11:57.460
"Baba" means "father" in Wakandan.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.927
- Cool.
- Yeah.

11:58.933 --> 12:01.052
Um, so, I'm just a little bit concerned

12:01.058 --> 12:02.857
- about Milo.
- Oh, okay.

12:02.863 --> 12:05.351
Okay, it's starting
to look like he, um...

12:05.357 --> 12:08.197
I'm j... I'm just getting this
feeling that he might be...

12:09.063 --> 12:10.573
I don't know, a bully.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.497
- What? What?
- That's absurd.

12:14.503 --> 12:18.346
Milo is a gorgeous and wildly popular

12:18.352 --> 12:20.238
golden-haired child
who's probably gonna

12:20.244 --> 12:22.056
- out-earn us all.
- Okay, okay, stop.

12:22.062 --> 12:23.934
He's got some goon working for him.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.558
- Goon?
- Yeah, Owen.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.347
He's like a... He's a sixth grader.

12:27.353 --> 12:29.013
Have you been interacting

12:29.019 --> 12:30.404
- with sixth graders?
- No.

12:30.410 --> 12:32.919
Because as a third-grade Room Parent,

12:32.925 --> 12:35.194
that's strictly against school rules.

12:35.524 --> 12:36.730
- There. Did you see that?
- What?

12:36.736 --> 12:37.938
- What?
- Look, look, look, look!

12:38.520 --> 12:39.810
Hello, Ms. David.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.761
Hey, superstar

12:41.767 --> 12:47.119
- You missed it. He... he just did the thing.
- I think I know what's going on here.

12:47.125 --> 12:51.227
Your ex-wife, Lena, she
was Room Parent royalty.

12:51.431 --> 12:53.523
The stuff legends are made of.

12:53.711 --> 12:56.924
Here comes Baba, feeling all threatened.

12:56.930 --> 12:59.135
- No.
- He starts swinging his hose around,

12:59.141 --> 13:01.268
- lookin' for a fire to put out...
- Mnh-mnh.

13:01.274 --> 13:05.658
but there is... no.. fire.

13:05.939 --> 13:08.253
Do I make myself clear?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.254
Yeah?

13:10.338 --> 13:13.635
Ooh! Really good news!

13:13.641 --> 13:15.312
- We did it.
- What did we do?!

13:15.318 --> 13:16.518
We broke through.

13:16.524 --> 13:18.143
Our hashtag "mommyfriendship"

13:18.149 --> 13:20.999
delivered thousands
of unique impressions

13:21.005 --> 13:23.111
in the coveted 47-55 demo

13:23.117 --> 13:25.754
that I was so sorely lacking in.

13:25.919 --> 13:28.561
- My sponsors are so stoked.
- That's amazing!

13:28.567 --> 13:30.756
- I know.
- And they are going to love

13:30.762 --> 13:32.449
that playroom centerpiece
I told you about.

13:32.455 --> 13:34.568
- I found someone who can fabricate...
- Cool, cool, cool.

13:34.574 --> 13:36.733
So, can we put a pin
in this for one second

13:36.739 --> 13:39.131
because I actually need
your design expertise

13:39.137 --> 13:41.043
on a much more pressing project.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.934
Rabbit's seven-month birthday.

13:44.754 --> 13:48.753
You want me to plan your
pet's birthday party?

13:48.759 --> 13:51.145
Oh, you're thinking of
Pamela. Rabbit's my daughter.

13:51.151 --> 13:52.874
I don't know why you
get confused by that.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.533
Yeah. I j... But...

13:55.539 --> 13:59.367
- you know, I'm not really a party planner.
- Supes interesante.

13:59.859 --> 14:01.264
I love that backstory.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.478
So, uh, this, I promise,

14:03.484 --> 14:07.698
will be the only non-playroom
favor that I ask of you. I swear.

14:07.882 --> 14:12.303
Okay. Well, if I do it, will
you at least mention my company?

14:12.309 --> 14:13.710
No can do, baby.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.892
Technically, I can only
mention two companies

14:15.898 --> 14:18.203
and those are MeUndies
and Westside Rentals.

14:18.585 --> 14:21.196
So, I have purchased...

14:24.246 --> 14:25.834
900 balloons.

14:26.019 --> 14:28.223
And I need every last breath

14:28.229 --> 14:30.835
in that adorable little
body to inflate them.

14:32.629 --> 14:34.317
You're a legend!

14:35.044 --> 14:37.359
I'm telling you, man,
the teacher is in on it!

14:37.365 --> 14:40.365
The kids, they're too scared to
even make eye contact with Milo.

14:40.466 --> 14:42.560
I've heard that's what it's
like working for Dr. Phil.

14:42.566 --> 14:45.352
I take the reins for one
minute and this is what happens?

14:45.358 --> 14:47.625
My 8-year-old is shaking kids down?

14:47.631 --> 14:50.395
You know what you have to
do, bro. Toss his room, man.

14:50.401 --> 14:52.026
Full-blown search and seizure.

14:52.032 --> 14:54.330
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:54.336 --> 14:56.113
No, going through his
stuff, that's a violation.

14:56.119 --> 14:58.119
It just means you want to keep him safe.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.119
Same reason why I go through
Camille's purse at night

15:00.125 --> 15:01.838
- while she's sleeping.
- You do?

15:01.844 --> 15:04.750
Yeah, I look at her receipts,
I pay her parking tickets.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.586
I learned all kinds of things about her,

15:06.592 --> 15:08.649
things I would never know otherwise.

15:09.499 --> 15:10.891
She's a bad tipper, bro.

15:10.897 --> 15:13.766
Dude, okay, okay. No, he's... he's...
he is on a field trip right now,

15:13.772 --> 15:16.175
so if we go in there, no
one's gonna even know that...

15:18.512 --> 15:19.712
Goin' in.

15:25.629 --> 15:27.233
- Aha!
- What are you thinking?

15:27.239 --> 15:30.631
Static Touch Plasma Sphere
with Mini Tesla Energy Coil.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me try.

15:33.274 --> 15:35.570
"To William, love Gramma Bea."?

15:38.990 --> 15:42.207
Josh Jr., you sneaky
bastard, you know something.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.659
You want me to slice that turtle?

15:47.668 --> 15:49.558
What the hell, dude?
Where did you get that?

15:49.564 --> 15:52.270
Camille's purse. I told
you. It's treasure trove.

15:52.581 --> 15:53.781
Cut him.

15:58.763 --> 16:00.129
Oh!

16:00.543 --> 16:03.346
What is this golden-haired
Svengali up to?

16:03.352 --> 16:05.356
I don't know, but I want in.

No. No, he does not.

16:56.108 --> 16:58.095
Milo. We need to talk. Now.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.193
We don't talk during "Guess
Who?" unless we're guessing who.

17:01.199 --> 17:02.399
Up.

17:03.085 --> 17:04.298
Fine.

17:04.304 --> 17:06.487
Okay, the jig is up.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.300
I found your stash and your cash.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.689
I cut William a deal, and
he's gonna sing like a bird.

17:10.794 --> 17:13.204
This is your last chance
to come clean with me.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.896
Oh, fine.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.607
I run a very profitable
organization called "Club Milo."

17:18.613 --> 17:20.660
I charge monthly dues, but in exchange,

17:20.665 --> 17:23.520
you get a place at my
lunch table and in my heart.

17:23.808 --> 17:26.693
People want that? What,
they pay for your company?

17:26.699 --> 17:30.185
Premium members get a
T-shirt with my face on it,

17:30.191 --> 17:32.113
- and I'll call you on your birthday...
- Milo.

17:32.425 --> 17:34.304
Friendship isn't commerce, pal.

17:34.609 --> 17:35.912
You can't sell it.

17:36.111 --> 17:38.815
You should try following the
example of your older siblings

17:38.821 --> 17:40.820
who show you kindness
because they love you

17:40.826 --> 17:42.614
- and you're their brother.
- You kidding?

17:42.620 --> 17:44.662
That's why I came up with Club Milo.

17:44.668 --> 17:47.950
- I pay them to spend time with me.
- What?

17:48.359 --> 17:52.138
Mae! Mason! I want you in
Milo's fluff and fold now!

17:52.840 --> 17:54.146
- You shrieked?
- What's up?

17:54.152 --> 17:56.256
Are you two selling
yourselves to your brother?

17:56.262 --> 17:57.722
- Pretty much.
- Yeah, kinda.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.495
What... what is wrong with
you? Have you no decency?

18:00.501 --> 18:02.427
He pays, and he pays well.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.992
I-I don't know whether
to be proud or horrified.

18:07.559 --> 18:09.952
Okay. Okay. You two.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.069
You guys, return all that
money you accepted from Milo.

18:13.075 --> 18:14.275
And you.

18:14.281 --> 18:16.150
You are gonna shut down your club

18:16.156 --> 18:18.468
and refund all of the membership fees.

18:18.474 --> 18:19.854
And furthermore,

18:19.860 --> 18:22.283
the three of you are gonna be
punished if you do not continue to have

18:22.289 --> 18:24.062
a loving relationship with each other.

18:24.068 --> 18:25.479
For free.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.549
Oh, my God. You're finally
here. So, I need a favor, baby.

18:35.869 --> 18:38.630
The clown I hired canceled.

18:39.150 --> 18:41.956
So you need me to find
someone else last minute?

18:41.962 --> 18:43.807
No, I already found someone last minute.

18:45.603 --> 18:48.776
Oh, and I will remember
to shout-out your business.

18:48.782 --> 18:51.196
What is the name of it
again? Golden Cervix?

18:51.993 --> 18:55.007
Here's the thing, Tamryn, and, um...

18:55.221 --> 18:56.737
I've really thought a lot about this,

18:56.743 --> 19:00.708
and even with the shout-out, I
only want to be your designer.

19:00.714 --> 19:03.434
I don't want to do any
of this other stuff.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.510
I feel like you're really
selling yourself short.

19:05.516 --> 19:07.972
You're so much more than a designer.

19:08.089 --> 19:09.768
What does that word even mean?

19:09.774 --> 19:12.393
You're like a mother figure to Rabbit

19:12.399 --> 19:14.694
and totally on-brand friend.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.967
I have my own friends,
and I have my own kids.

19:17.973 --> 19:19.474
I just need a job.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.680
This is the job.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.086
Then I'm not interested.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.970
Well, then, I'm not interested.

19:26.476 --> 19:29.275
You see that, though? How
much we have in common?

19:33.771 --> 19:35.353
Room Baba?

19:35.574 --> 19:38.373
- Hm-hmm.
- This place looks great.

19:38.379 --> 19:40.295
And you cooked dinner?

19:40.476 --> 19:42.874
- It's not even your week.
- Stop it.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.053
I told you it's my turn
to pick up the slack.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.678
Well, speaking of slack,

19:47.684 --> 19:50.379
I missed the 100 Days of School party.

19:50.385 --> 19:52.988
Oh, God. Who cares? How many
times have I missed that thing?

19:52.994 --> 19:55.714
- 79.
- Oh, good.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.721
- So you were counting.
- Mmm!

19:58.726 --> 20:01.000
- This is really good.
- Yeah? Here, here, here.

20:01.006 --> 20:02.524
- Try it with some bread.
- Oh.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.423
- So I have a little update on the Milo front.
- Mm.

20:05.429 --> 20:07.497
His odd behavior
wasn't about the divorce

20:07.503 --> 20:10.193
or the downsizing of his
room, so we're not bad parents.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.912
No, he was just acting weird because
he's running an extortion scheme!

20:14.802 --> 20:16.002
Oh.

20:16.762 --> 20:19.260
Mm. Well, we are bad parents,

20:19.266 --> 20:20.885
just not the way that we thought.

20:20.891 --> 20:22.852
- You know what? I'll take it.
- Hmm?

20:22.858 --> 20:25.985
Oh, and I seized hundreds of dollars

20:25.991 --> 20:29.021
that's he's been
laundering inside Josh Jr.

20:29.692 --> 20:30.895
Wait.

20:31.105 --> 20:34.122
- Did Milo make more money than me this week?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.128 --> 20:36.708
- But I thought we could put it towards college.
- Hmm.

20:36.714 --> 20:38.889
- Or bail. Mm?
- Mm.

20:39.369 --> 20:40.877
- Bail.
- Probably...

20:46.648 --> 20:49.176
You wanna make skinny
margs and drinkstagram?

20:49.182 --> 20:51.162
Not for a million [BLEEP] dollars.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.269
Well, what if I just said... sorry?

20:56.267 --> 20:57.684
I'm sorry, too.

20:57.862 --> 21:01.282
I should have been more
supportive and less threatened.

21:01.288 --> 21:04.064
No, Camille, you were
right. She was using me.

21:04.070 --> 21:05.376
And after we parted ways,

21:05.382 --> 21:07.572
all of her followers unfollowed me.

21:08.263 --> 21:11.189
Now I'm back down to
the 5,000 you bought me.

21:12.537 --> 21:13.935
BFFs again?

21:15.021 --> 21:16.318
I mean,

21:16.427 --> 21:19.119
I've never banged a
Property Brother, but...

21:19.125 --> 21:20.325
sure.

21:20.331 --> 21:25.331
