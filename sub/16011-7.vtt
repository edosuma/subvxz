02:04.800 --> 02:05.840
[door opens]

02:17.240 --> 02:18.320
- You didn't go to math.

02:18.321 --> 02:19.400
- I forgot.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.040
I can see why.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.720
But you can't

02:27.721 --> 02:28.920
just sit here like this.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.160
It could be days before

02:30.161 --> 02:31.360
that thing lights up again.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.480
Or seconds. I can't miss it.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.360
[sighs] You won't miss it.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.320
- But, you're going to
- History class.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.720
- I have to get back there,
- Vincent.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.360
I understand that.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.880
But you don't just

02:50.881 --> 02:52.120
live in that world.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.520
You live in this world too.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.280
I won't tell you again.

03:02.281 --> 03:03.400
You're not gonna miss it.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.080
- I know, I know.
- I'm in this world now.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.880
- And I get it, I'm here.
- Good.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.800
- Now which way
- is unicorn class?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.280
[chuckles] Just kidding.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.200
- You're late
- for your geography quiz.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.440
Right!

03:13.480 --> 03:15.200
We'll talk about this later!

03:20.240 --> 03:22.040
The friend.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.100
I'm sorry,

03:23.101 --> 03:24.120
I don't know your name.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.760
Vincen...

03:26.800 --> 03:29.520
I didn't say I wanted to.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.056
- [laughs nervously] I...
- I... need... Agh...

03:31.080 --> 03:32.680
You have somewhere to be?

03:32.720 --> 03:34.440
I... I gotta...

03:34.480 --> 03:36.480
- Well, I've got
- all the time in the world.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.640
And I really feel like talking.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.800
- So let's talk about
- your little friend,

03:43.880 --> 03:45.000
And her book.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.520
Common, let me go,

03:58.521 --> 03:59.960
what do you need me for?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.900
No, we need to know about

04:01.901 --> 04:03.800
your little friend's book

04:03.840 --> 04:05.720
Let me go. I mean,

04:05.721 --> 04:07.600
what have I done?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.560
[Violetta] You know things.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.040
- You hang out with
- that little elf friend of yours.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.120
[sighs] Okay, read it.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.320
Don't rush, don't rush...

04:41.000 --> 04:42.040
[sighs]

04:42.080 --> 04:43.440
Okay, got it.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.240
Hi Mia. Say your password.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.560
"Wise and weary as you tread,

04:51.600 --> 04:52.800
watch your back,

04:52.801 --> 04:54.000
but look ahead."

05:09.720 --> 05:12.400
[screams]

05:15.760 --> 05:19.240
Uugh! Ugh! Oof!

05:19.280 --> 05:20.560
[Yuko] Onchao...

05:20.600 --> 05:22.520
Doesn't this apple look yummy?

05:23.760 --> 05:25.480
[Yuko] I bet it's delicious...

05:25.520 --> 05:26.640
[Mo] C'mon Onchao!

05:26.680 --> 05:27.840
You love apples.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.640
[Mia] Onchao!

05:29.680 --> 05:32.160
Mia! Are we glad to see you!

05:32.200 --> 05:33.680
Nothing's cheering him up.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.680
He misses his mother.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.280
I know exactly how you feel.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.760
It's going to be okay.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.640
It's good to have you back, Mia.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.760
Yeah! What's the new Oracle?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
I'm not sure what to make of it.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.480
"Wise and weary as you tread;

05:46.520 --> 05:49.040
watch your back but look ahead."

05:49.080 --> 05:51.440
Back and ahead at the same time?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.120
Maybe it means to walk sideways.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.600
This is gonna get old real fast!

05:58.640 --> 06:00.020
Well whatever it means, there's

06:00.021 --> 06:01.400
no use sitting around here.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.700
We've got stuff to do,

06:02.701 --> 06:03.960
right guys?!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.520
- We do?
- Yeah!

06:05.560 --> 06:07.020
Elves are always doing...

06:07.021 --> 06:08.480
elf stuff!

06:08.520 --> 06:10.120
Maybe we could use some help.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.120
To stay busy and distracted!

06:13.160 --> 06:15.080
[Yuko] Ohhh! Right! Distracted!

06:15.120 --> 06:16.880
Come on, Onchao!

06:27.000 --> 06:28.680
[Mo] See? That's our job.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.480
You unicorns make the dust,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.880
- we elves deliver it
- to the plants that need it most.

06:32.920 --> 06:33.960
Partners!

06:35.840 --> 06:37.740
Hey, Yuko,

06:37.741 --> 06:39.640
did you run out of unicorn dust?

06:39.680 --> 06:40.820
Maybe we need Onchao

06:40.821 --> 06:41.960
to make us some more, right?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.600
Oh! Oh yeah! I'm totally

06:44.601 --> 06:47.200
out of unicorn dust!

06:47.240 --> 06:48.760
Go ahead, Onchao!

06:48.800 --> 06:50.200
Make some dust.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.600
We could sure use some.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.860
I think you just scrape

06:52.861 --> 06:54.080
your horn on a tree or a rock,

06:54.120 --> 06:55.440
don't you?

06:59.280 --> 07:01.120
[Mia] C'mon boy, go for it!

07:04.320 --> 07:05.680
Come on Onchao,

07:05.681 --> 07:07.040
keep trying! You'll get it.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.340
Weird. I guess we need a unicorn

07:12.341 --> 07:13.920
to show you how to do that.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.480
[Yuko] The FernGrass Herd grazes

07:15.481 --> 07:17.000
on the other side of the ridge.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.456
- You guys could go meet them and
- we'll catch up when we're done.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.620
[Mia] That's perfect!

07:20.621 --> 07:21.760
Onchao,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.200
- how about we go
- learn from some other unicorns?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.280
[snorts]

07:38.320 --> 07:39.360
Those other unicorns

07:39.361 --> 07:40.400
are gonna love you!

07:43.120 --> 07:44.160
[neighs]

07:45.120 --> 07:46.160
[gasps]

07:48.000 --> 07:49.880
- You know,
- it might be easier if you fly.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.360
You've got wings, you know.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.920
[impact]

08:00.880 --> 08:02.040
Ooh...

08:04.760 --> 08:05.780
Don't worry Onchao,

08:05.781 --> 08:06.800
you'll get better.

08:06.840 --> 08:07.880
[snorts]

08:11.200 --> 08:13.440
The FernGrass Herd! Come on!

08:14.760 --> 08:17.240
[Phuddle] Aww, duddlesnuff.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.440
Oh.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.440
[grunts with effort]

08:20.480 --> 08:22.360
- It's only Phuddle.
- Ugh...

08:22.400 --> 08:23.460
How come nobody ever

08:23.461 --> 08:24.520
says... [gasps]

08:24.560 --> 08:26.440
"Hooray, it's Phuddle!"

08:26.480 --> 08:27.760
[pants]

08:27.800 --> 08:29.760
- Phuddle,
- what are you doing here?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.600
I've been searching

08:31.601 --> 08:33.400
for partridgeberries for my tea.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.120
You haven't seen any, have you?

08:35.159 --> 08:36.280
Tea?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.679
Partridgeberry tea!

08:37.720 --> 08:40.360
It's the King of Pan's favorite!

08:40.400 --> 08:41.539
I'm kinda trying to get back

08:41.541 --> 08:42.679
in his good books,

08:42.720 --> 08:44.680
- and as easy
- "quick fix" ideas go,

08:44.720 --> 08:46.300
A traditional Tea Ceremony's

08:46.301 --> 08:47.880
really not bad.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.940
Well, we're looking for

08:48.941 --> 08:49.960
the FernGrass Herd.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.560
Yeah, great. Unless they're

08:51.561 --> 08:53.120
made of partridgeberries,

08:53.160 --> 08:54.920
I don't wanna hear about it.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.400
There they are!

09:05.401 --> 09:06.800
Aren't they beautiful?!

09:06.840 --> 09:07.920
[neighs affirmatively]

09:07.960 --> 09:09.040
[all neigh nervously]

09:09.080 --> 09:10.840
It's okay! Don't go!

09:10.880 --> 09:11.920
[snorts]

09:15.520 --> 09:18.080
C'mon Onchao. It's okay.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.840
This is Onchao.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.016
- He's young, and he really needs
- to learn your ways.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.400
I'm a whole horn short

09:24.401 --> 09:25.760
of being a unicorn.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.840
[neighs loudly]

09:33.880 --> 09:35.120
[neighs]

09:35.160 --> 09:36.960
You try!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.040
[neighs]

09:41.840 --> 09:43.240
[Mia] That's it, Onchao,

09:43.241 --> 09:44.640
looking good!

09:44.680 --> 09:45.760
- [neighs]

09:45.761 --> 09:46.840
- [snorts]

09:46.880 --> 09:48.200
[Mia] Hahaha!

09:48.240 --> 09:49.720
That was good!

09:49.760 --> 09:51.640
- You just need
- to keep practicing.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.100
[gasps] Look! That's how

09:57.101 --> 09:58.280
you do it!

10:04.160 --> 10:05.320
You did it!

10:05.360 --> 10:06.400
[unicorns neigh]

10:11.680 --> 10:12.720
[snorts]

10:14.680 --> 10:15.720
[neighs]

10:23.600 --> 10:24.660
- It must be your turn!

10:24.661 --> 10:25.720
- [neighs]

10:25.760 --> 10:27.920
There you go! Atta boy!

10:32.680 --> 10:33.840
[shrieking]

10:35.920 --> 10:37.380
Munculus! Oh no!

10:37.381 --> 10:38.840
We should warn the herd.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.720
[snorts]

10:49.600 --> 10:50.900
I didn't even know unicorns

10:50.901 --> 10:52.200
signaled danger like that!

10:52.240 --> 10:53.440
That's probably something

10:53.441 --> 10:54.640
you should learn Onchao.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.800
[neighs]

10:59.760 --> 11:00.960
[snorts]

11:03.560 --> 11:05.440
[neighing fearfully]

11:08.160 --> 11:09.480
Onchao stop!

11:09.481 --> 11:10.800
You're spooking the herd!

11:14.720 --> 11:15.760
[neighs]

11:18.320 --> 11:20.120
What's that you say?

11:20.160 --> 11:21.840
Why yes, your Highness,

11:21.841 --> 11:23.520
it is a lovely day!

11:23.560 --> 11:25.400
- Croak!
- What's that?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.500
You feel terrible

11:26.501 --> 11:27.560
about banishing me?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.240
- Croak!
- Oh!

11:29.280 --> 11:30.500
Try not to be too hard

11:30.501 --> 11:31.720
on yourself. [chuckles]

11:31.760 --> 11:33.640
- Croak croak!
- You know?

11:33.680 --> 11:35.240
You make a pretty good King

11:35.241 --> 11:36.800
of Pans to rehearse with.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.400
Kinda look like him too.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.720
Now, I just need to

11:39.721 --> 11:41.000
balance the teapot

11:41.040 --> 11:42.140
on this incredibly

11:42.141 --> 11:43.240
unsteady rock...

11:43.280 --> 11:44.420
just like

11:44.421 --> 11:45.560
in the real tea ceremony...

11:46.680 --> 11:48.000
[approaching gallop]

11:48.040 --> 11:49.200
Croak!

11:49.240 --> 11:50.280
[gasps]

11:53.080 --> 11:54.440
Whaaa!

11:57.320 --> 11:59.440
[Mia] Onchao, come back!

11:59.480 --> 12:00.700
- Woooaaaahhhhhh!

12:00.701 --> 12:01.920
- Sorry!

12:01.960 --> 12:03.320
Wooo...

12:04.200 --> 12:05.840
Wooo...

12:05.880 --> 12:07.400
Gotcha!

12:07.440 --> 12:09.720
[Phuddle] Phuddle-sticks!

12:09.760 --> 12:11.640
[sighs] So much for making nice

12:11.641 --> 12:13.520
with the King of Pans.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.000
Don't get me wrong,

12:15.001 --> 12:16.440
I like living with the elves,

12:16.480 --> 12:17.760
what with my respected position

12:17.761 --> 12:19.040
and all.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.780
But do you know how it feels

12:20.781 --> 12:22.480
being an outcast?

12:22.520 --> 12:24.400
- More than you know.
- Ugh.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.920
I guess I'm stuck

12:25.921 --> 12:27.400
with the humiliation forever.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.580
Oh come on,

12:28.581 --> 12:29.720
I bet some of the berries

12:29.760 --> 12:31.040
at the bottom are still okay.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.120
[chewing noises]

12:33.720 --> 12:34.680
[snorts]

12:34.720 --> 12:36.560
Okay, well,

12:36.600 --> 12:37.920
that can't be all the

12:37.921 --> 12:39.240
partridgeberries in Centopia.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.400
We'll just find some

12:40.401 --> 12:41.520
that you haven't sat in.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.980
Yeah, well, good luck.

12:43.981 --> 12:46.400
I've looked everywhere.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.500
Huh! Wait a second.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.560
The thorny bushes!

12:50.600 --> 12:52.560
- Hope you haven't
- sat in those too.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.120
Well, yes,

12:54.121 --> 12:55.640
but that's not what I meant.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.480
There's always partridgeberries

12:57.481 --> 12:59.280
down by the thorny bushes!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.840
Let's go! I'll help!

13:02.920 --> 13:04.620
Onchao, you stay with the herd!

13:04.621 --> 13:06.320
I'm not going far!

13:06.360 --> 13:07.400
[neighs]

13:11.200 --> 13:12.360
[muttering] ...isn't even

13:12.361 --> 13:13.520
the right way...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.760
no idea where we are...

13:15.800 --> 13:17.040
Phuddle, are you sure you know

13:17.041 --> 13:18.280
where you're going?

13:18.320 --> 13:19.660
Of course! Why do you

13:19.661 --> 13:21.000
keep asking me that?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.340
Because you keep muttering

13:22.341 --> 13:23.640
that you have no idea

13:21.040 --> 13:23.640
where you're going.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.320
I was saying that out loud?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.000
- I thought
- I was just thinking it.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.560
[Phuddle] Wait!

13:30.600 --> 13:33.040
I know that shortcut!

13:33.080 --> 13:34.360
Phuddle, wait!

13:34.400 --> 13:36.520
[Phuddle] Woooooaaa...

13:36.560 --> 13:37.800
WHOA!

13:37.840 --> 13:39.440
[grunts]

13:39.480 --> 13:41.320
Ugh! Stupid gravity!

13:41.360 --> 13:43.880
I'll get you next time!

13:43.920 --> 13:45.280
- Are you okay?

13:45.281 --> 13:46.640
- I think so.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.560
[grunts] I'm stuck!

13:48.600 --> 13:50.000
What is this stuff?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.040
[Phuddle] It's clinging moss.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.400
It's strong enough

13:53.401 --> 13:54.720
to hold a dragon!

13:54.760 --> 13:58.280
[grunting with effort]

14:01.000 --> 14:02.800
I told you.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.660
Ugh... The perfect ending

14:04.661 --> 14:06.480
to the perfect day.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.080
Onchao! ONCHAO!

14:10.320 --> 14:13.400
[Mia] Onchao? ONCHAO,

14:13.440 --> 14:14.800
ONCHAO, HELP!

14:16.960 --> 14:19.720
[grunting]

14:19.760 --> 14:20.920
Oogh...

14:20.960 --> 14:22.680
Ugh! It's hopeless!

14:22.720 --> 14:24.160
[Mia] Wait! I forgot,

14:24.200 --> 14:25.440
the friendship ring!

14:25.480 --> 14:26.520
DING!

14:31.080 --> 14:33.720
Yuck. Rotten partridgeberries.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.640
Too late for them.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.520
- [ring sounds]
- Look!

14:37.560 --> 14:39.320
- Trouble with
- the FernGrass Herd?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.860
I sure hope not.

14:40.861 --> 14:42.360
We better hurry.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.800
Take us to Mia.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.400
[cries] We'll have to eat leaves

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
and drink rain water.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.096
- Should we take turns
- weeping in dismay?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.040
Or both weep at once?

14:56.480 --> 14:58.020
Oooh...

14:58.021 --> 14:59.560
I shouldn't have done that.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.440
[Mo] Mia!

15:02.480 --> 15:05.760
Oh! Am I glad to see you!

15:05.800 --> 15:07.520
- [Phuddle] You can
- say that again!

15:07.560 --> 15:09.100
Look what somebody's

15:09.101 --> 15:10.640
shortcut got us into!

15:10.680 --> 15:12.620
Somebody? Taking that shortcut

15:12.621 --> 15:14.560
wasn't my idea.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.780
Yeah, well,

15:15.781 --> 15:16.960
let's just get outta here!

15:17.000 --> 15:19.200
[Mo] Okay, ready? PULL!

15:19.240 --> 15:20.600
[all grunt]

15:20.640 --> 15:22.240
Wow, you're really stuck.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.480
[neighing]

15:24.880 --> 15:26.240
Onchao?!

15:26.280 --> 15:28.320
Stay there! It's dangerous!

15:28.360 --> 15:29.440
[neighs]

15:38.080 --> 15:40.240
[Mia] Wow, great idea Onchao!

15:40.280 --> 15:41.920
[Mo] Yuko, give me a hand!

15:45.480 --> 15:47.400
Hold on tight, Phuddle!

15:47.440 --> 15:49.320
- Why do I need to...
- [Mo] NOW!

15:49.360 --> 15:51.680
[all] WWWHHHHOOOOAAAA!!!

15:51.720 --> 15:52.760
AHHH!

15:52.800 --> 15:54.360
Agh! Onchao?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
You saved me!

15:56.440 --> 15:58.680
Oooo... Ah...

15:58.720 --> 16:01.320
[Mia] Ha ha! Look at you!

16:01.360 --> 16:03.840
Whoa. That little guy can fly!

16:05.120 --> 16:07.040
Wow! You've been practicing!

16:08.560 --> 16:10.440
- What were you guys
- doing down here?

16:10.480 --> 16:11.800
It's a long story.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.440
[Phuddle] With a sad ending.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.040
I still don't have

16:15.041 --> 16:16.600
any partridgeberries.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.840
- Partridgeberries?

16:17.841 --> 16:19.040
- [Phuddle] By the way...

16:20.200 --> 16:23.080
I found the thorny bushes

16:25.240 --> 16:26.600
[Yuko] Yuck...

16:26.640 --> 16:28.200
I don't think partridgeberry tea

16:28.240 --> 16:29.920
is supposed to smell like that.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.480
- [Phuddle] Great...
- How many times

16:31.520 --> 16:32.760
Do I have to get my hopes up,

16:32.800 --> 16:34.520
only to have them crushed again

16:34.560 --> 16:35.860
like so many berries

16:35.861 --> 16:37.160
under my butt?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.040
Onchao, you're up!

16:48.240 --> 16:49.380
- [Mia] Um... Phuddle...

16:49.381 --> 16:50.520
- [Phuddle] Forget it.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.080
I'm not getting excited again.

16:52.081 --> 16:53.600
It's hopeless.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.440
- Phuddle...

16:55.441 --> 16:57.240
- Nope. Not gonna happen.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.200
Whoaaaaa!

17:03.320 --> 17:05.359
[Mia] Way to go, Onchao!

17:05.400 --> 17:07.640
Yeah, nice one, little guy!

17:12.079 --> 17:13.839
Can we get this over with,

17:13.880 --> 17:15.079
Phuddle?

17:15.119 --> 17:16.400
Almost ready!

17:18.839 --> 17:20.020
[whispering] I can't see.

17:20.021 --> 17:21.200
Let's go closer!

17:21.240 --> 17:23.720
We can't! We'll scare the Pans.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.280
- [snorts]
- Shh! Onchao,

17:25.319 --> 17:26.640
They'll hear you.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.000
What's gotten into him?

17:28.040 --> 17:29.520
He says he sees something.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.040
Today, Phuddle!

17:32.080 --> 17:33.640
Almost!

17:33.680 --> 17:34.720
[grunts]

17:34.760 --> 17:36.240
All set!

17:36.280 --> 17:37.760
Would you like some tea,

17:37.761 --> 17:39.240
your Highness?

17:39.280 --> 17:41.200
Of course I want some tea!

17:41.240 --> 17:43.200
Why do you think I'm here?!

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
[neighing]

17:45.440 --> 17:46.960
Onchao wait!

17:47.000 --> 17:48.800
AAHHH!!!

17:48.801 --> 17:50.600
Elves! EVERYONE HIDE!

17:50.640 --> 17:52.920
Waaaa. Waaaahaaa!

17:54.160 --> 17:55.880
[Mia] What is it Onchao?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.360
[gasps]

18:00.400 --> 18:01.840
I don't believe it!

18:01.880 --> 18:03.680
[Mia] A piece of the Trumptus?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.560
"Wise and weary as you tread;

18:06.600 --> 18:08.520
Watch your back

18:08.521 --> 18:10.440
but look... a-HEAD!"

18:10.480 --> 18:12.100
That's what the oracle meant!

18:12.101 --> 18:13.720
To look on his head!

18:16.720 --> 18:18.240
[Mia laughs]

18:19.800 --> 18:21.120
Your highness,

18:21.160 --> 18:23.240
I apologize for startling you,

18:23.280 --> 18:24.880
we mean you no harm.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.560
Could we have this piece?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.360
Well... since you asked nicely.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.760
It was just a trinket

18:30.761 --> 18:32.120
I found anyway.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.760
But may I have the rest back?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.160
I'm... very sorry,

18:36.161 --> 18:37.520
your highness.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.600
Worst tea ceremony EVER!

18:40.640 --> 18:42.560
Oh... Don't concern yourself.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.040
Really?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.680
It's the effort that counts.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.780
You are welcome back in

18:47.781 --> 18:49.840
the domain of the Pans!

18:49.880 --> 18:51.320
- I can't believe it!

18:51.321 --> 18:52.760
- Now come!

18:52.800 --> 18:54.860
Hide forever in the woods with

18:54.861 --> 18:56.920
your Pan brothers and sisters!

18:56.960 --> 18:58.740
Never to speak to an elf

18:58.741 --> 19:00.520
for the rest of your days,

19:00.560 --> 19:02.960
forever eating wood chips

19:02.961 --> 19:05.360
and discarded apple cores.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.520
Really? Forever?

19:10.960 --> 19:13.000
Um... are you sure?

19:13.001 --> 19:15.040
I mean, I really messed up bad

19:15.080 --> 19:16.520
bad and chances are

19:16.521 --> 19:17.960
I'm going to mess up again.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.060
Remember the accident

19:19.061 --> 19:20.120
with the acorn pile

19:20.160 --> 19:22.440
or the seven week bonfire?

19:22.480 --> 19:24.600
That is true.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.000
[acting] Please, don't banish me

19:26.001 --> 19:27.360
again.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.000
I would be ever so disappointed

19:30.040 --> 19:31.380
Well you can't live

19:31.381 --> 19:32.720
in both worlds.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.920
You are re-banished!

19:35.960 --> 19:39.480
Forbidden to return to the Pans!

19:39.520 --> 19:41.400
But I'm sure

19:41.401 --> 19:43.280
we'll see you again anyway.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.240
YES! Ha ha. Hey guys, wait up.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.840
[Mia] The oracle was telling us

19:53.841 --> 19:55.720
where to look for this piece of

19:51.960 --> 19:55.720
the trumptus all along.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.056
- They're riddles
- we'll have to solve,

19:57.080 --> 19:58.640
But they're definitely helping.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.320
- They're not
- the only things helping.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.840
That's twice this little guy

20:01.880 --> 20:03.640
- has sniffed one
- of those things out.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.656
- Do you think you can do that
- eighteen more times?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.200
[Onchao neighs]

20:10.280 --> 20:11.840
Now that's the way

20:11.841 --> 20:13.400
a unicorn should walk!

20:13.440 --> 20:15.640
Go on Onchao, fly!

20:16.720 --> 20:20.360
Haha haha.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.840
YA-HOOOO!

20:24.800 --> 20:27.380
Huh? What's this?

20:27.381 --> 20:29.960
A flying unicorn?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.280
Wait until Panthea sees this!

20:33.320 --> 20:34.560
[Yuko and Mo laugh]

20:34.600 --> 20:35.880
[Gargona] Blasted elves.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.560
We'll meet another time,

20:39.600 --> 20:41.520
little winged unicorn.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.320
[dragons growl]

20:45.640 --> 20:47.120
[tinkling]

20:47.160 --> 20:49.040
Oh no, my battery!

20:49.080 --> 20:50.720
Stay safe Onchao!

21:01.720 --> 21:02.760
[sighs]

21:12.840 --> 21:15.720
Common, really?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.960
- Oh common,
- leave m-leave me alone,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.376
- Don't you have
- better things to do?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.960
You're not going anywhere

21:22.000 --> 21:23.416
- until you tell me
- what I want to know.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.080
As long as you keep hanging out

21:25.120 --> 21:26.300
with that cute little

21:26.301 --> 21:27.480
elf friend of yours,

21:27.520 --> 21:28.920
you better get used to being

21:28.921 --> 21:30.320
the center of my attention.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.520
[Mia] Hey Vincent.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.060
I just wanted to let you know

21:35.061 --> 21:36.640
your fungus experiment is ready.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.240
Fungus experiment?

21:39.280 --> 21:41.040
[Mia] Yeah. I checked it myself.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.180
That stuff is spreading

21:42.181 --> 21:43.280
like crazy. And it's itchy.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.280
- You've got some on your hand.
- Isn't it itchy?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.420
- Itchy?

21:51.421 --> 21:52.600
- Yeah...

21:52.640 --> 21:55.200
and contagious too.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.040
[coughs]

21:58.480 --> 22:00.840
[coughs louder]

22:00.880 --> 22:02.400
Aren't we late for something?

22:02.401 --> 22:03.920
I know we are.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.600
[Vincent sighs]

22:08.640 --> 22:10.480
- Good to have you back
- in the real world.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.560
Good to be back.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.936
- How did you know
- about my fungus experiment?

22:14.960 --> 22:16.240
You didn't touch it, did you?

22:17.360 --> 22:18.640
[Mia] Really?

22:18.680 --> 22:19.880
[laughs]

22:22.520 --> 22:23.800
Aren't you late

22:23.801 --> 22:25.080
for your geography test?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.360
AAH!

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
And thanks!
