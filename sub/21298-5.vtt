[ Growling ]
I will return...

10:07.440 --> 10:08.508
What happened?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.911
Thank you for saving us,
Apollo.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.313
Yeah, no,
it was pretty messed up

10:13.346 --> 10:14.782
so, yeah, no,
you're welcome.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.851
Uh, hey, this might be
a bad time,

10:17.885 --> 10:20.988
but I'd love to get
that scone recipe from you.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.690
Wait, we forgot Sammy!

10:22.723 --> 10:26.293
I've abandoned my son,
I've abandoned my bo--

10:26.326 --> 10:27.961
Oh, there he is.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.531
**

10:31.564 --> 10:35.202
Camping...
can be a lot of fun.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.672
I hope this experience
hasn't soured you on it.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.540
"Soured"
is putting it mildly.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.710
I was coerced, drugged,

10:42.743 --> 10:45.345
and possessed
by a demonic ghost!

10:45.378 --> 10:47.480
Apollo: But, aside from that,

10:47.514 --> 10:50.317
uh, it wasn't that bad.

10:52.019 --> 10:55.222
