Duh.

I need that wish.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.357
When I find that Grunicorn,
I'm gonna wish

19:18.423 --> 19:21.426
for him to leave
and never come back.

That's so stupid.

Wishes are stupid.

wanted: a hot dog.

{\an3}Yeah, real good use

{\an3}Why not wish for French fries

could have some of our own.
