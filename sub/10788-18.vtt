WEBVTT

00:26.834 --> 00:28.875
IS IT OVER?

00:28.875 --> 00:32.834
UH, YEAH,
2 HOURS AND 45
MINUTES LATER.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.458
I KNOW.
IT'S THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.
IT'S WAY TOO LONG.

00:34.458 --> 00:35.792
IT'S--IT--

00:36.834 --> 00:38.083
ARE YOU CRYING?

00:38.083 --> 00:39.458
NO.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.000
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN--

00:41.000 --> 00:44.708
OK, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A TEAR SHED OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

00:44.708 --> 00:45.959
YOU WERE CRYING.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.583
THAT'S A GOOD THING,
RIGHT?

00:47.583 --> 00:49.208
NOT UNLESS I WAS
BORED TO TEARS.

00:50.166 --> 00:50.250
SEE, THAT'S JUST MEAN.

00:52.208 --> 00:54.083
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.333
NOTHING BRINGS OUT
THE INNER BULLY IN ME

00:55.333 --> 00:57.333
QUITE LIKE THE SIGHT
OF A NERVOUS FILMMAKER.

01:00.834 --> 01:02.041
[LAUGHS]

01:02.041 --> 01:02.250
WELL?

01:04.208 --> 01:04.834
IT'S GOOD.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.625
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

01:07.625 --> 01:08.834
YOU THINK?
YEAH, I MEAN,

01:08.834 --> 01:12.667
I CAN SEE SOMETHING
ACTUALLY HAPPENING
WITH THIS.

01:12.667 --> 01:13.667
REALLY?

01:13.667 --> 01:15.375
YEAH.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.000
THAT'S WHY
I WAS CRYING.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.917
IT'S A PRETTY
AMAZING THING

01:19.917 --> 01:22.041
TO BE THERE
FOR THE MOMENT
YOUR BEST FRIEND

01:22.041 --> 01:25.083
BECOMES EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S DREAMT ABOUT
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.291
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WAS REALLY SURPRISING?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.834
WHAT?
CHARLIE.

01:32.834 --> 01:33.583
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

01:33.583 --> 01:35.875
HE WAS...
SHOCKINGLY GOOD.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.291
I KNOW. IT KILLS ME!

01:37.291 --> 01:40.083
IN REAL LIFE, THE GUY
BARELY PASSES FOR HUMAN,

01:40.083 --> 01:41.917
BUT ON-SCREEN
HE'S GOT SOMETHING.

01:41.917 --> 01:43.250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT IT WORKS.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.166
HE'S NOT THAT BAD
OF A GUY, DAWSON.

01:45.166 --> 01:48.291
I KNOW HE WAS
A JERK TO JEN,

01:48.291 --> 01:50.875
BUT I THINK THAT WAS
MORE OUT OF FEAR
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.208
UNDERNEATH THE HAIR
AND THE ATTITUDE,

01:53.208 --> 01:54.959
I THINK HE--

01:56.583 --> 01:58.291
HOLY SMOKES, LEERY.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.083
YOU WORK FAST,
DON'T YA?

02:00.083 --> 02:01.625
BREAK UP WITH BETTY,
AND YOU ALREADY GOT
VERONICA IN YOUR BED.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.750
HEY!

02:03.750 --> 02:05.834
HOW'D YOU LIKE THE MOVIE?
DID SHE LIKE THE MOVIE?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.708
IF YOU WOULD
LET ME RESPOND,
I COULD TELL YOU.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.000
I THOUGHT
IT WAS EXCELLENT.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.500
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.959
BUT WAS THERE
EVER ANY DOUBT?

02:14.959 --> 02:16.792
BUT THIS IS
GOOD NEWS, HUH?

02:16.792 --> 02:19.125
BECAUSE IT'S HIGH TIME
WE SCREEN THIS PUPPY.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.000
YEAH, WE STILL
GOT A LOTTA WORK
TO DO.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.125
WELL, THEN YOU BETTER
GET TO WORK, CHIEF.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.834
TOMORROW'S APPROACHING
AWFULLY FAST!

02:24.834 --> 02:26.375
EXCUSE ME?

02:26.375 --> 02:28.000
OOH...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.041
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
DIDN'T I?

02:29.041 --> 02:31.834
SILLY ME.
SILLY WHAT?

02:31.834 --> 02:34.041
WE'RE SCREENING
THE MOVIE TOMORROW
AT SCHOOL

02:34.041 --> 02:36.875
FOR CAST,
CREW, AND ASSORTED
HIGHBROW INTELLECTUALS.

02:36.875 --> 02:37.834
NO, WE'RE NOT.

02:37.834 --> 02:41.083
SEE...I KNEW YOU'D
HAVE THAT REACTION.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.291
THAT'S WHY
I WENT AROUND YOU.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.708
THE TRAIN HAS LEFT
THE STATION.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.375
EXCUSE ME.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.959
OLIVER, HOLD ON!

04:03.875 --> 04:06.208
SERIOUSLY, NOT ONLY
IS THIS THE BEST MOVIE

04:06.208 --> 04:07.333
I'VE EVER BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH,

04:07.333 --> 04:11.250
BUT THIS JUST MIGHT BE
THE BEST MOVIE EVER.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.208
ARE YOU JOKING?

04:13.208 --> 04:15.083
IT'S--
IT'S WAY TOO LONG,

04:15.083 --> 04:17.541
IT'S LIKE
THE ENGLISH PATIENT
WITHOUT THE LAUGHS.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.291
DAWSON, YOU'RE
BEING WAY TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF HERE.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.000
I MEAN,
I'M THE WRITER.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.417
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO
LOATHE MY OWN WORK,

04:24.417 --> 04:25.667
BUT I DON'T.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.083
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT KICKS SOME SERIOUS
DONKEY ASS.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.583
I'M NOT SAYING IT--

04:30.333 --> 04:32.417
NEVER MIND. I'M NOT
SAYING IT'S TERRIBLE.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.208
I'M SAYING IT NEEDS
A HELL OF A LOT OF WORK.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.750
ENTIRE SCENES
NEED TO BE RESHOT.

04:36.750 --> 04:37.542
WHICH ONES?

04:37.542 --> 04:40.083
THE SEX SCENE, FOR ONE.
WHY?

04:40.083 --> 04:41.583
FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE,

04:41.583 --> 04:44.500
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE CHARLIE
IN ALL OF HIS...GLORY.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.083
YOU DON'T SAY.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.417
IS IT SUBSTANTIAL?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.750
IT'S ENOUGH TO WARRANT
ITS OWN CREDIT
IN THE MAIN TITLES.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.583
WHEN THE FILM'S
INEVITABLY ACQUIRED
BY A MAJOR STUDIO,

04:52.583 --> 04:55.959
WE'LL HAVE THE CASH
TO CGI IT OUT OF THERE.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.125
NEXT?

04:57.125 --> 04:59.333
I FEEL LIKE I'M WORKING
WITH GILBERT GODFREY.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.959
THIS IS...I...

05:01.959 --> 05:03.708
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REAL
PROBLEM IS, RIGHT?

05:03.708 --> 05:04.583
[LAUGHS]

05:07.125 --> 05:08.542
PLEASE, ENLIGHTEN ME.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.875
YOU'RE STILL REELING
FROM YOUR BREAKUP
WITH JEN.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.750
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S IT, OLIVER.

05:13.750 --> 05:14.875
COME ON, CAPTAIN.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.458
YOU DATED HER
FOR MONTHS.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.959
SHE HELPED YOU
GRIEVE.

05:17.959 --> 05:21.125
SHE ROBBED YOU
OF YOUR PRECIOUS
FLOWER, RIGHT?

05:21.125 --> 05:24.583
I MEAN, I DON'T CARE
HOW COOL YOU WANNA
PLAY THAT OFF,

05:24.583 --> 05:26.917
BUT THAT MEANS
SOMETHING, BUCKO,
SERIOUSLY.

05:26.917 --> 05:28.542
DO YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT?

05:28.542 --> 05:29.917
NO.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.041
GREAT.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.083
CAN I ASK YOU
ANOTHER QUESTION?

05:33.458 --> 05:33.917
SURE.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.834
WELL...

05:35.834 --> 05:39.708
WOULD IT
BE A PROBLEM
IF I WERE TO, SAY,

05:39.708 --> 05:41.208
ASK HER OUT?

05:46.834 --> 05:49.417
Pacey [panting]:
WHERE...ON EARTH...

05:49.417 --> 05:51.708
DID YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT?

05:51.708 --> 05:53.583
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.667
[BOTH LAUGH]

05:55.667 --> 05:58.500
BUT MOST GUYS
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.333
HOW MANY GUYS
HAVE YOU DONE THAT WITH?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.792
ENOUGH TO KNOW YOU'VE
GOT STAYING POWER.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.417
[GRUNTS]

06:11.000 --> 06:12.583
[CHUCKLES]

06:13.125 --> 06:15.667
I'M REALLY GLAD

06:15.667 --> 06:18.667
THAT BRECHER DECIDED
TO TAKE HIS WIFE
TO THE CARIBBEAN,

06:18.667 --> 06:19.917
AND I AM REALLY GLAD

06:19.917 --> 06:22.708
THAT THEY ASKED YOU
TO STAY HERE
WHILE THEY'RE GONE.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.708
I'M AS GLAD AS YOU ARE.

06:23.708 --> 06:28.583
I AM MORE GLAD.
I AM GLADDER. GLADDEST.

06:28.583 --> 06:31.041
AND I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING
BELOW MY WAIST.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.291
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN?

06:32.291 --> 06:34.417
GIVE ME ANOTHER HOUR,
YOU'LL BE IN A COMA.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.375
HOW MANY IS ENOUGH?

06:38.375 --> 06:40.583
WHAT YOU TALKIN'
'BOUT, WILLIS?

06:40.583 --> 06:42.583
OH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOTHING,

06:42.583 --> 06:45.000
JUST--AHEM--
HOW MANY...GUYS...

06:46.959 --> 06:49.000
IS ENOUGH TO...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.750
HAVE I GIVEN ACCESS
TO MY MOST INTIMATE
OF AREAS?

06:51.750 --> 06:53.542
WELL, YEAH.
RESPECTFULLY, OF COURSE.

06:53.542 --> 06:57.000
YOU'RE REALLY
ASKING ME THIS QUESTION?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.083
NO, BECAUSE
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

06:59.083 --> 07:02.458
FORGET I ASKED.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.458
MM...

07:03.458 --> 07:05.917
HOW MANY GIRLS
HAVE YOU--

07:05.917 --> 07:07.792
6.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.834
7 INCLUDING YOU.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.250
DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG
TO THINK OF THAT ONE.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.458
NOPE. HA HA.

07:17.417 --> 07:20.834
THAT'S NOT...A LOT.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.417
THAT'S NOT A LOT
COMPARED TO WHAT?

07:24.417 --> 07:27.625
COMPARED
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.125
OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

07:29.125 --> 07:30.917
YOU TOTALLY ARE ASKING
ME THAT QUESTION!

07:30.917 --> 07:32.083
I TOLD YOU MINE.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.166
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW

07:33.166 --> 07:36.250
HOW MANY MEN I'VE SLEPT
WITH, PACEY. TRUST ME.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.083
YOU THINK YOU DO RIGHT NOW,
BUT ONCE I'VE TOLD YOU,

07:39.083 --> 07:40.792
YOU'D WISH I HADN'T.
IT'S THAT MANY?

07:40.792 --> 07:42.083
[LAUGHS]

07:42.083 --> 07:43.542
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

07:43.542 --> 07:46.291
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF EMMANUELLE,
LADY CHATTERLEY,

07:46.291 --> 07:47.291
MADONNA?

07:47.291 --> 07:48.291
OH, YEAH.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.166
PRUDES.

08:01.458 --> 08:01.917
HEY.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.667
OH, HI.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.375
NOTHING.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.417
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
ACTUALLY. UH...

08:11.417 --> 08:14.542
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M, UH...

08:14.542 --> 08:16.625
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
THE SCREENING TODAY.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.667
THE MOVIE'S NOT--
IT'S NOT FINISHED.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.125
BUT FROM THE
OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE,

08:21.125 --> 08:22.333
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S FINISHED.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.792
BUT IT'S--
REALLY, IT--

08:25.083 --> 08:26.333
IT'S NOT...FINISHED.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.250
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.667
IT'S OK
IF THIS IS WEIRD.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.458
WHICH THING?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.833
YOU AND ME.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.542
AH. [LAUGHS]

08:36.542 --> 08:37.582
I THINK IT'S OK

08:37.582 --> 08:40.125
IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO THIS NEXT PART.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.332
I THINK IT'D BE ODD
IF WE DID, RIGHT?

08:41.332 --> 08:44.125
RIGHT. RIGHT,
IT'S JUST--

08:45.500 --> 08:46.792
NO.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.625
WHAT?

08:48.625 --> 08:49.750
NO, IT JUST--

08:52.333 --> 08:54.250
THIS IS SUCH A FAMILIAR
SCENE, YOU KNOW?

08:54.250 --> 08:57.333
YOU AND ME IN HERE
JUST KIND OF CHECKING IN
WITH EACH OTHER

08:57.333 --> 09:00.000
BEFORE WE GO OUT
INTO THE WORLD...

09:00.000 --> 09:01.875
IT WAS SUCH A COMFORT.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.875
FOR ME, TOO.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.875
I DON'T THINK
THAT HAS TO STOP.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.542
I HOPE NOT.

09:07.542 --> 09:08.959
RIGHT, BUT...

09:08.959 --> 09:10.959
LAST WEEK YOU WERE
UP AGAINST THE COUNTER

09:10.959 --> 09:13.208
AND I WAS COVERING
YOUR FACE WITH KISSES,

09:13.208 --> 09:15.208
AND NOW...
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.166
I MEAN, IT'S--
THAT'S DONE.

09:22.792 --> 09:26.250
WHO'S TO SAY
WHAT WE CAN
AND CAN'T DO?

09:30.625 --> 09:32.208
YOU SAW THE MOVIE?

09:32.208 --> 09:33.417
MM-HMM. I SAID THAT,
DIDN'T I?

09:33.417 --> 09:34.542
DIDN'T I
JUST SAY THAT?

09:34.542 --> 09:35.875
I WANT YOU TO BE
HONEST WITH ME, JOEY.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.500
FRIENDS ARE HONEST,
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO BE:

09:37.500 --> 09:39.250
HONEST AND UNMERCIFUL.
HOW BRILLIANT WAS I?

09:39.250 --> 09:40.708
YOU WERE HORRIBLE.
GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.

09:40.708 --> 09:41.917
I CAN HANDLE IT.
NO. YOU'RE WASHED UP.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.208
YOU'RE NO GOOD.
STOP SUGARCOATING!

09:43.208 --> 09:44.041
WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE?

09:44.041 --> 09:46.125
AUDREY,
YOU WERE FANTASTIC!

09:46.125 --> 09:49.708
YOU'RE CHARMING AND
FUNNY AND BEAUTIFUL
AND SEXY,

09:49.708 --> 09:51.667
AND YOU HAVE
AMAZING CHEMISTRY
WITH CHARLIE,

09:51.667 --> 09:54.750
WHO, SURPRISINGLY,
IS REALLY GOOD.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.542
CHARLIE? WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT CHARLIE HERE?

09:57.542 --> 09:58.792
THIS IS ABOUT ME:
MY PERFORMANCE,

09:58.792 --> 10:01.083
MY APPEARANCE,
MY FUTURE CAREER.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.917
I'M A NEUROTIC ACTRESS,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
HAVE SOME SENSITIVITY.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.291
AUDREY, YOU'RE
GONNA SEE THE MOVIE
IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.625
STOP INTERROGATING ME.

10:06.625 --> 10:10.708
YOU LOOK HOT.
WHY DO YOU LOOK HOT?

10:11.583 --> 10:14.792
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

10:14.792 --> 10:15.750
WAIT. DO I LOOK HOT?
IN THE MOVIE, I MEAN.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.750
DO I LOOK HOT
OR DO I LOOK SCORCHING?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.959
WHAT SCENE DO I LOOK BEST IN?
IS IT THE END?

10:19.959 --> 10:21.083
I BET IT'S THE END,
ISN'T IT?

10:21.083 --> 10:21.708
AUDREY.

10:21.708 --> 10:25.250
SORRY. SORRY. [SIGHS]

10:25.250 --> 10:28.500
CAN I ASK YOU
ONE MORE QUESTION?
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MOVIE.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.458
WELL, IF IT'S ABOUT YOU,
I GOT NOTHIN' LEFT.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.959
NO. IT'S ABOUT PACEY.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.583
THIS MORNING,
WE WERE TALKING,

10:34.583 --> 10:37.291
AND HE ASKED ME
HOW MANY GUYS I'D SLEPT WITH.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.500
HE DID?
YEAH. WELL...

10:39.500 --> 10:41.166
SORT OF. I DON'T KNOW.
IT CAME UP.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.625
DID YOU TELL HIM?
NO! NO! NOT YET!

10:43.625 --> 10:45.291
I'M DEBATING IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

10:45.291 --> 10:46.625
I DON'T KNOW.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.291
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.417
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY
THAT HONESTY HAS
ALWAYS WORKED FOR ME.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.625
I SHOULD TELL HIM.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.625
HMM, BUT THEN AGAIN,
THE MALE EGO

10:55.625 --> 10:57.125
IS A VERY FRAGILE
AND DELICATE THING,

10:57.125 --> 10:59.041
AND IF HE'S ASKING YOU
THE QUESTION,

10:59.041 --> 11:01.458
IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE HE'S HARBORING
SOME DEEP INSECURITIES,

11:01.458 --> 11:02.458
IN WHICH CASE,
THE ANSWER WOULD DO
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.458
I SHOULDN'T TELL HIM.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.000
IT DEPENDS.
ON WHAT?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.792
ON HOW MANY GUYS
YOU'VE SLEPT WITH.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.834
USUALLY, I DON'T LIKE
TO WATCH THE WORK
THAT I'VE DONE.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.500
I FEEL LIKE IT INTERFERES
WITH MY PROCESS,

11:19.500 --> 11:22.625
BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE
AN EXCEPTION FOR DAWSON.
YOU KNOW, HE'S MY FRIEND.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.000
WELL, THAT'S
GENEROUS OF YOU.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.375
OK. I STILL
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

11:25.375 --> 11:26.542
WHY JOEY
GOT DROPPED OFF FRONT,

11:26.542 --> 11:29.208
BUT I HAVE TO SEARCH FOR
A PARKING SPACE WITH YOU.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.333
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE DEAL.
[LAUGHS]

11:31.333 --> 11:32.375
AND WHAT DEAL
WOULD THAT BE?

11:32.375 --> 11:35.792
YOU KNOW,
OUR ARRANGEMENT
WE GOT GOIN'.

11:35.792 --> 11:39.291
AND WHAT ARRANGEMENT
WOULD THAT BE?

11:39.291 --> 11:41.583
WELL, I MEAN,
I UNDERSTAND

11:41.583 --> 11:42.959
WHERE THERE'S
NO CLEAR DEFINITIONS

11:42.959 --> 11:44.166
TO THE ARRANGEMENT
THAT WE HAVE,

11:44.166 --> 11:45.834
BUT I WAS THINKING,
ACTUALLY, THAT WE--

11:45.834 --> 11:47.291
YOU KNOW,
WE MIGHT WANT TO
GET INTO THAT POINT

11:47.291 --> 11:49.208
WHERE WE
START DEFINING
HOW IT IS THAT--

11:49.208 --> 11:51.667
GOD, MAN,
MY PALMS ARE SWEATY.
WHY IS THAT?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.625
27.
WHOO! WHAT?

11:53.625 --> 11:54.250
27 MEN.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.208
WHAT?!

11:56.208 --> 11:58.250
STOP, PLEASE!

12:04.250 --> 12:07.625
JACK, HURRY UP!
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.291
HI.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.208
HELLO.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.375
CAN I HELP YOU?

12:15.375 --> 12:17.750
JENNIFER. JEN.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.125
YEAH.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.792
I'M CLIFTON.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.375
CLIFTON?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.542
YOUR GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME
YOU WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL,

12:25.542 --> 12:28.792
BUT I GUESS WORDS
CAN'T QUITE CONVEY
A THING LIKE THAT.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.417
THIS IS CLIFTON.

12:34.959 --> 12:36.750
DAWSON.
NO.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.959
IT'S JACK, ACTUALLY.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.834
JACK. THE HOMOSEXUAL!

12:39.834 --> 12:42.250
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.917
YOU, TOO.

12:43.917 --> 12:44.959
I'M A FRIEND OF EVELYN'S.

12:44.959 --> 12:47.417
SHE INVITED ME
TO JOIN YOU ALL THIS EVENING

12:47.417 --> 12:49.792
FOR THE SCREENING
OF DAWSON LEERY'S FILM.

12:49.792 --> 12:51.333
NICE.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.125
AH, MR. SMALLS.

12:54.125 --> 12:57.208
I SEE INTRODUCTIONS
HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.166
[CHUCKLES]

13:00.959 --> 13:03.500
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF,
JENNIFER.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.917
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.917
WHAT WAS THAT
THAT YOU WERE DOING
WITH THE KISSING?

13:08.917 --> 13:14.166
WHY DID YOU--YOUNG LADY,
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

13:14.166 --> 13:16.125
CLIFF, ARE YOU
MY GRAMS' BOYFRIEND?

13:16.125 --> 13:19.291
JENNIFER,
I DON'T THINK--
YES, I AM.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.417
I THINK.
AREN'T I?

13:20.417 --> 13:24.125
YES. YES, YOU ARE.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.166
OH, MY GOODNESS! WHY--

13:26.166 --> 13:27.625
DID THIS
JUST SLIP YOUR MIND?

13:27.625 --> 13:29.834
IS THIS
SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST
FORGOT TO MENTION TO ME?

13:29.834 --> 13:32.000
SHOULD CLIFTON AND I
LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE
FOR A MINUTE?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.250
'CAUSE
WE CAN DO THAT.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.375
CLIFF, WHAT DO YOU DO?

13:34.375 --> 13:35.750
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING!

13:35.750 --> 13:40.041
I TEACH GEOMETRY AT
ST. JUDE'S EPISCOPAL
ON THE EAST SIDE.

13:40.041 --> 13:40.834
ARE YOU MARRIED?

13:40.834 --> 13:43.291
NOT CURRENTLY.
I WAS.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.125
SHE PASSED AWAY.
I'M A WIDOWER.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.458
ALL RIGHT.
DO YOU APPROVE?

13:48.458 --> 13:48.917
MAY WE LEAVE NOW?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.834
YEAH.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.041
YEAH.

13:59.542 --> 14:02.458
GREAT! TERRIFIC!
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:02.458 --> 14:03.500
AS LONG AS WE'RE
SAYING ALL THE THINGS
THAT WE NEVER SAID,

14:03.500 --> 14:05.667
LET ME JUST SAY THIS:

14:05.667 --> 14:08.000
I THINK YOU ARE
A SELF-SERIOUS,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.750
PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL ASS!

14:09.750 --> 14:10.875
NO. I ALWAYS HAVE.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.875
I MEAN, Ph.D. IN
CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.166
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

14:16.166 --> 14:19.291
NO. DON'T YOU DARE!
THOSE CDs ARE MINE!

14:19.291 --> 14:21.625
HELLO?! HEL--GOD--OH!

14:23.250 --> 14:24.667
[SIGHS]

14:24.667 --> 14:27.917
YOU OK?
HELLO? EXCUSE ME?
NOSY?

14:27.917 --> 14:29.708
I'M SORRY. I WASN'T
TRYING TO EAVESDROP.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.000
IT'S JUST YOU TALK
RATHER LOUDLY.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.166
WHY ARE WE TALKING?

14:32.166 --> 14:33.667
WHY ARE WE EVEN HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION?

14:33.667 --> 14:34.875
BEATS ME.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.417
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.041
YOU JUST CAUGHT ME
SMACK-DAB IN THE MIDDLE
OF A VERY UGLY BREAKUP.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.542
I'M SORRY.

14:40.542 --> 14:41.875
WHO DUMPED WHO?

14:41.875 --> 14:43.333
HE'S DUMPING ME,
WHICH REALLY
INFURIATES ME,

14:43.333 --> 14:46.000
BECAUSE I CAN'T SAY
I EVEN LIKE THE GUY.
HE'S AN IDIOT.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.708
HE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE IDIOT,

14:47.708 --> 14:49.792
WHICH INFURIATES ME
EVEN MORE,

14:49.792 --> 14:50.875
BECAUSE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I WAS ABOVE THAT,

14:50.875 --> 14:52.333
WHICH
I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.542
DOES LITVACK
STILL TEACH HERE?

14:55.542 --> 14:57.708
YES, HE DOES.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.083
HE'S TEACHING A CLASS
THIS SEMESTER CALLED
"BOOBS, BOOZE, AND BULLETS:

15:00.083 --> 15:02.208
STYLE AND SUBSTANCE IN
THE AGE OF THE BLOCKBUSTER."

15:02.208 --> 15:05.333
OH, GOD. YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THAT
PHASE, AREN'T YOU?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.458
SHE SAID CONDESCENDINGLY.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.166
OH, COME ON. YOU
KNOW THAT PHASE WHERE
YOU'VE JUST BEEN EXPOSED

15:09.166 --> 15:11.041
TO THE VERY BEST
THE AVANT-GARDE
HAS TO OFFER,

15:11.041 --> 15:13.542
SO, OF COURSE, HOLLYWOOD
SUCKS THE BIG ONE,

15:13.542 --> 15:14.875
AND WOULDN'T IT
BE GREAT IF WE COULD
ALL JUST RUN AROUND

15:14.875 --> 15:16.875
WITH OUR LITTLE
DIGITAL CAMERAS,

15:16.875 --> 15:18.083
FILMING EACH OTHER
GOING TO THE BATHROOM

15:18.083 --> 15:19.959
IN THE NAME OF TRUTH
AND HONESTY?

15:21.166 --> 15:22.583
YOU'RE A HANDFUL.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.542
THAT'S WHAT
THEY TELL ME.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.625
AND YOU'RE QUITE
PRESUMPTUOUS, TOO,

15:24.625 --> 15:25.917
CONSIDERING YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

15:25.917 --> 15:29.083
OH, SURE I DO.
I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

15:29.083 --> 15:29.917
FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE
LAST COUPLE YEARS OFF
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.750
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

15:31.750 --> 15:32.959
RUN LOLA RUN.

15:32.959 --> 15:33.959
LIAR! THAT'S THE MOVIE
YOU WHIP OUT

15:33.959 --> 15:36.208
TO SHOW PEOPLE
HOW COOL YOU ARE!

15:36.208 --> 15:37.458
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN COOL.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.875
I'M INTERESTED IN THE
MOVIE THAT MADE YOU CRY

15:39.875 --> 15:40.875
AND YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHY.

15:40.875 --> 15:41.917
I'M INTERESTED
IN THE MOVIE

15:41.917 --> 15:43.375
THAT YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS

15:43.375 --> 15:45.375
YOU WENT TO GO SEE
ON OPENING NIGHT. WANT
TO KNOW WHAT MINE IS?

15:45.375 --> 15:47.166
PLEASE.
HARDBALL.

15:47.166 --> 15:50.250
KEANU REEVES COACHES
THIS INNER-CITY
LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM

15:50.250 --> 15:52.166
AND, IN THE PROCESS,
CHANGES THEIR LIVES
FOR THE BETTER.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.708
I LOST IT. I MEAN,
I CRIED LIKE A BABY.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.291
I SAW IT IN THE THEATER
5 TIMES.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.250
THAT EXPLAINS THAT, THEN.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.291
WHAT?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.875
WHY YOUR BOYFRIEND
DUMPED YOU.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.083
YOU'RE A SENTIMENTAL
DRAMA QUEEN WITH REALLY
CRAPPY TASTE IN MOVIES.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.875
WOW! WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
LITTLE MAN?

16:05.875 --> 16:09.083
DAWSON. DAWSON LEERY.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.291
OH! [LAUGHS]

16:10.291 --> 16:11.667
WHAT?

16:11.667 --> 16:13.708
NICE TO MEET
YOU, DAWSON.
MY NAME IS AMY LLOYD.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.083
I'M THE FILM CRITIC
FOR THE BOSTON WEEKLY.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.417
I'M HERE
TO REVIEW YOUR MOVIE.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.083
HEY, POTTER.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.250
CHARLIE.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.333
YOU MUST HAVE MOVED
THROUGH THE PAPARAZZI
LINE RATHER QUICKLY.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.708
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHERE'S THE FIANCEE?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.333
WHERE'S GWYNETH PALTROW?
OUT SICK TONIGHT?

16:50.333 --> 16:53.041
[LAUGHS] WELL, I BROKE UP
WITH HER, YOU KNOW.

16:53.041 --> 16:53.291
I MET SOMEONE ELSE.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.208
MUST BE QUITE A GIRL
TO USURP GWYNETH.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.625
AMAZING, ACTUALLY.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.000
MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT
OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.500
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
INSIST ON TEASING ME,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.666
I THINK THAT MEANS YOU'RE
OBLIGATED TO SIT NEXT TO ME.

17:05.666 --> 17:08.375
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT
ABOUT THIS MYSTERY GIRL
YOU'RE WAITING FOR?

17:08.375 --> 17:11.416
WELL, HEY,
IF SHE SHOWS UP,
I'LL JUST MAKE YOU MOVE.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.290
THANKS.

17:25.875 --> 17:29.166
YOU KNOW,
I SAW THE MOVIE.

17:29.166 --> 17:29.708
YEAH?

17:29.708 --> 17:33.083
WAS I ANY GOOD?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.834
PRETTY GOOD.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.959
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
WITH YOU TONIGHT?

17:37.959 --> 17:39.583
NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:39.583 --> 17:41.250
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.375
WELL, YOU SEEM KIND OF,
I DON'T KNOW, DIFFERENT.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.917
DIFFERENT IN A GOOD WAY?

17:45.917 --> 17:47.417
YEAH. PRETTY GOOD.

17:48.959 --> 17:50.166
SO DO YOU.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.708
YEAH?

17:51.708 --> 17:54.667
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GUESS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

17:54.667 --> 17:58.208
TO PLAY THE ROLE
OF A SEXY INDIE ROCKER
24 HOURS A DAY,

17:58.208 --> 18:00.291
7 DAYS A WEEK.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.333
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
THE ACTUAL CHARLIE TODD

18:02.333 --> 18:04.542
REARS HIS LITTLE,
DEFORMED HEAD.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.667
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT AS--

18:05.667 --> 18:08.083
IT'S NICE.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.792
IT'S NICE WHEN
YOU'RE NOT TRYING SO HARD.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.583
KIND OF LIKE HANGING OUT
WITH A REAL PERSON

18:12.583 --> 18:14.250
RATHER THAN
A HIPNESS QUOTATION.

18:14.250 --> 18:18.166
YOU KNOW, CONTRARY
TO POPULAR OPINION,

18:18.166 --> 18:21.041
I MAY NOT ACTUALLY
BE THE DEVIL.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.667
[LAUGHS] DON'T GET
AHEAD OF YOURSELF, SLIM.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.917
THE JURY'S STILL OUT
ON THAT ONE.

18:24.917 --> 18:27.750
HA HA HA HA!

18:27.750 --> 18:29.959
I'M SORRY
I CRASHED INTO YOU.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.583
[SIGHS]

18:40.583 --> 18:43.625
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE WAITED
TILL YOU PARKED?

18:43.625 --> 18:45.208
WELL, NOT IF YOU
WERE GOING FOR EFFECT.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.542
YOU OK?

18:47.542 --> 18:48.542
YEAH, I'M FINE.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.625
MY CAR'S A LITTLE
BRUISED, BUT I'M FINE.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.500
NO. I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE SEX THING.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.542
RIGHT. THAT.

18:55.542 --> 18:56.208
I REMEMBER THAT.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.959
ARE WE, LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

18:58.959 --> 19:00.750
IT'S NOTHIN'.
WE'RE FINE.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.000
[STARTS ENGINE]

19:05.500 --> 19:07.834
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
IT'S "GO" TIME.
YOU READY?

19:07.834 --> 19:08.708
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU INVITED A CRITIC?

19:08.708 --> 19:11.125
I DON'T KNOW.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.667
MAYBE BECAUSE
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE A SURPRISE. HEH!

19:13.667 --> 19:15.834
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
OLIVER, I'M THE DIRECTOR.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.583
YOU HAVE TO CLEAR
STUFF LIKE THAT WITH ME.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.834
OK, WHY IS THIS
A BAD THING?

19:19.834 --> 19:22.625
IN WHAT UNIVERSE IS IT
EVEN REMOTELY A NEGATIVE

19:22.625 --> 19:24.708
TO HAVE A QUALIFIED,
TRAINED PROFESSIONAL

19:24.708 --> 19:26.125
EVALUATE
YOUR MASTERPIECE?

19:26.125 --> 19:28.750
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO
ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO THAT.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.750
OK. WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.667
YOU GEEKS PLANNING
ON SHOWING THIS THING,

19:31.667 --> 19:33.083
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
ACT IT OUT FOR US?

19:33.083 --> 19:37.166
DAWSON, THIS
IS AMY LLOYD OF
THE BOSTON WEEKLY.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.458
YEAH, WE MET.
WE'VE EXCHANGED UNPLEASANTRIES.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.083
LOOK, MISS LLOYD,
UH, AMY.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.208
IF YOU COULD
JUST TAKE YOUR SEAT,

19:48.208 --> 19:49.667
WE'RE STILL WAITING
FOR A COUPLE VIPs
TO ARRIVE,

19:49.667 --> 19:50.834
AND THEN
WE'LL GET STARTED.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.417
LISTEN, FELLAS,
IT'S BEEN A SLICE AND ALL,

19:53.417 --> 19:54.750
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR AMATEUR HOUR,

19:54.750 --> 19:58.875
SO GIVE ME A RING
WHEN YOU GET
YOUR ACT TOGETHER, OK?

20:01.208 --> 20:04.708
DAWSON LEERY,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:04.708 --> 20:07.583
TOLD HER SHE HAD
CRAPPY TASTE IN MOVIES.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.125
OH!

20:10.125 --> 20:11.500
AND I MAY HAVE
CALLED HER A DRAMA QUEEN.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
I...DON'T REMEMBER.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.333
WHY, OH, WHY DID YOU
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.792
IS IT
BECAUSE YOU HATE ME?

20:16.792 --> 20:18.125
WE WERE JUST
HAVING A CONVERSATION.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.208
NINCOMPOOP!
DON'T YOU KNOW

20:19.208 --> 20:20.375
WHO DOUGLAS CAVELL IS?
WHO?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.333
EXACTLY! AND I'LL TELL
YOU WHY YOU DON'T KNOW.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.542
BECAUSE MANY MOONS AGO,
OUR MISS LLOYD

20:24.542 --> 20:26.750
WROTE
SOMEWHAT UNFAVORABLY
ABOUT HIS THESIS FILM

20:26.750 --> 20:28.917
BECAUSE HE SAID
SOMETHING NASTY
ABOUT POINT BREAK.

20:28.917 --> 20:32.583
THESE DAYS,
OLD DOUGIE IS SITTING
BEHIND THE COUNTER

20:32.583 --> 20:35.708
OF THE VIDEO STORE
OF HIS HOMETOWN
OF NOWHERE, USA.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.375
ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.
YOU CALM DOWN.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.375
I'M GONNA FREAK OUT.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.333
THIS IS OUR FUTURE.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.417
THIS IS OUR WHOLE LIVES.
HA HA HA!

20:43.417 --> 20:45.250
[CLEARS THROAT]

20:45.250 --> 20:47.250
OK, THIS IS
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.625
YOU HAVE
TO GO AFTER HER. YOU
HAVE TO GET HER BACK,

20:48.625 --> 20:52.750
APOLOGIZE, KISS HER ASS,
DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO DO,

20:52.750 --> 20:53.917
JUST GET HER BACK.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.500
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

20:58.458 --> 21:02.041
I'M GONNA GO HIT ON
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.250
HEY.
HEY.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.708
HEY, I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
WHO YOU WERE.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.417
OH, AND IF YOU HAD,
YOU WOULD HAVE
KISSED MY ASS?

21:15.417 --> 21:18.166
NO, I--YEAH, PROBABLY.

21:18.166 --> 21:20.917
LISTEN,
YOU'RE A VERY NICE KID,

21:20.917 --> 21:22.458
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I WAS RUDE BEFORE,

21:22.458 --> 21:24.625
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
I'M A HANDFUL,

21:24.625 --> 21:26.708
AND I'M A SENTIMENTAL
DRAMA QUEEN,

21:26.708 --> 21:28.041
SO I'M GONNA GO,
AND YOU, GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR FLICK.

21:28.041 --> 21:31.083
WOULD IT MATTER ONE IOTA
IF I TOLD YOU
I WAS A HUGE FAN?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.208
NOT SO MUCH, NO,
'CAUSE AS A RULE,

21:32.208 --> 21:33.792
FILM CRITICS
DON'T HAVE FANS.

21:33.792 --> 21:38.041
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
ROGER EBERT HAS FANS.
HARRY KNOWLES HAS FANS.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.834
RIGHT. SO GO STALK THEM
AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.917
I'D RATHER STALK YOU
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME.

21:41.917 --> 21:42.959
YOU'RE A LITTLE CUTER
THAN THEY ARE.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.458
AH, I HAVE A SMILE.
OK, CAN I BUILD ON THAT?

21:45.458 --> 21:47.834
UH...IN YOUR REVIEW
OF ALMOST FAMOUS,

21:47.834 --> 21:49.291
YOU SAID IT WAS THE KIND
OF FILM THAT REMINDS US

21:49.291 --> 21:50.792
WHY WE STILL GO
TO THE MOVIES.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.458
THAT WAS LAST FALL.
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

21:54.458 --> 21:56.625
I DO.
IT GAVE ME CHILLS.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.208
ME, TOO,
WHEN I WROTE IT.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.834
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED
THAT REVIEW.

21:59.834 --> 22:00.792
IT WAS A GREAT REVIEW.

22:01.542 --> 22:04.208
YOU REALLY LIKE
MY STUFF?

22:04.208 --> 22:05.417
EVERY THURSDAY,
I HAVE THIS RITUAL.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.625
WHEN THE WEEKLY COMES OUT,
I GRAB IT.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.959
I HEAD OVER TO THE COFFEE SHOP,
AND I SIT THERE

22:08.959 --> 22:10.291
AND I READ YOUR REVIEWS.

22:10.291 --> 22:12.166
I'LL BE HONEST. I DON'T
ALWAYS AGREE WITH YOU.

22:12.166 --> 22:14.375
I MEAN, SOMETIMES
YOU REALLY MAKE ME MAD,

22:14.375 --> 22:15.875
BUT I ALWAYS WANT
TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK,

22:15.875 --> 22:17.083
WHICH IS WHY
THE THOUGHT OF YOU SITTING

22:17.083 --> 22:19.500
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT
SOMETHING THAT I'VE DIRECTED

22:19.500 --> 22:21.834
SCARES THE LIVING
DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.625
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS?

22:24.625 --> 22:27.458
WHY DON'T WE HEAD OVER
TO THAT COFFEE SHOP
AND SEE WHAT'S WHAT?

22:27.458 --> 22:29.417
WHO KNOWS?
YOU MAY GET LUCKY.

22:29.417 --> 22:30.917
I'M IN A STRANGE MOOD.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.792
JOEY, I NEED
A POW-WOW.

22:46.792 --> 22:47.917
NOW?

22:47.917 --> 22:50.500
HELLO? DOES
THE EXPRESSION
"BROS BEFORE HOS"

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.583
YES, PRINCESS.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.500
OK.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.208
SO, IF YOU HAPPEN
TO BE TALKING TO PACEY,

23:02.208 --> 23:04.083
AND IT
HAPPENS TO COME UP,

23:04.083 --> 23:05.041
I SLEPT WITH 27 PEOPLE.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.208
ROCK AND ROLL!

23:06.208 --> 23:08.375
BITE ME, WILL YOU?

23:09.417 --> 23:11.000
YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH
27 DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.583
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

23:13.583 --> 23:14.708
YOU HAVEN'T?
I MAY HAVE
ADJUSTED

23:14.708 --> 23:17.708
THE NUMBER SLIGHTLY.
A LITTLE CREATIVE MATH.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.375
SO, YOU SLEPT
WITH MORE  THAN
27 DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

23:19.375 --> 23:21.917
OK, SEE,
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.667
THE POINT IS THAT
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID THIS MORNING,

23:23.667 --> 23:24.542
AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT MERCEDES LOWENSTEIN

23:24.542 --> 23:26.250
USED TO SAY
ABOUT THESE THINGS--

23:26.250 --> 23:27.708
AND WHAT DID SHE
USED TO SAY?

23:27.708 --> 23:29.625
WELL, SHE SAID THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND SEX,

23:29.625 --> 23:31.291
A SLIGHT VARIATION
ON THE TRUTH

23:31.291 --> 23:32.166
IS ALWAYS PREFERABLE
TO THE ACTUAL TRUTH.

23:32.166 --> 23:33.750
AUDREY,
THAT'S TERRIBLE ADVICE.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.708
MERCEDES LOWENSTEIN
IS AN IDIOT.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.083
NO. MERCEDES LOWENSTEIN
IS A WHORE.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.750
YOU CAN'T DO THESE
KINDS OF THINGS HALFWAY.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.875
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THE WHOLE TRUTH AND
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

23:43.875 --> 23:44.792
SO HELP ME GOD?

23:44.792 --> 23:47.417
I'M SERIOUS, OK?
THINK ABOUT IT.

23:47.417 --> 23:49.583
IF YOU DON'T, IF YOU LET
HIM BELIEVE THIS LIE,

23:49.583 --> 23:51.250
CAN ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

23:51.250 --> 23:53.375
FROM THIS POINT ON BE AS
GREAT AS IT SHOULD BE?

23:53.375 --> 23:56.417
AND NOT FOR HIM,
FOR YOU.

23:56.417 --> 24:00.500
AUDREY, YOU DESERVE
SOMETHING GREAT HERE.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.417
YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE THAT.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.083
NOW, GO DO
THE HARD THING.

24:04.792 --> 24:07.083
OK.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.667
GOOD LUCK.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.500
EVERYTHING COOL?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.291
[SIGHS]

24:22.291 --> 24:25.000
RELATIVELY SPEAKING.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.542
SO, WHEN'S THIS THING
GONNA START, ANYWAY?

24:27.542 --> 24:29.166
WHY? YOU NERVOUS?

24:29.166 --> 24:31.750
MAYBE...A LITTLE.

24:31.750 --> 24:35.792
SEE, THIS GIRL,
THIS MYSTERY GIRL,

24:35.792 --> 24:36.834
WHO'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE,

24:36.834 --> 24:41.375
SHE SHOWED UP, AND
SHE'S IN HERE RIGHT NOW,

24:41.375 --> 24:45.333
AND I REALLY,
REALLY WANT HER
TO BE IMPRESSED.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.500
AND I'M JUST HOPING
THAT THIS AUDIENCE--

24:47.500 --> 24:50.166
THIS AUDIENCE CAN JUST
TOTALLY TAKE ME IN,

24:50.166 --> 24:51.542
AND THEN, MAYBE,

24:51.542 --> 24:55.041
SHE'LL SEE ME THE WAY
THAT I WANT HER
TO SEE ME.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.458
WELL, POINT HER OUT.
I'LL TELL IF YOU
HAVE A PRAYER OR NOT.

24:57.458 --> 25:03.125
[LAUGHS]
WELL...SHE'S, UM...

25:03.125 --> 25:05.542
SHE'S SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.083
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT NEARLY AS COOL

25:09.083 --> 25:10.834
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE,
CHARLIE TODD.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.333
YOU KNOW, ALL EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY,

25:12.333 --> 25:15.125
I'M EXACTLY AS COOL
AS I THINK I AM.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.208
THERE YOU GO.
CASE IN POINT.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.625
SEE, GUYS LIKE YOU
WALK AROUND EVERY DAY

25:19.625 --> 25:20.959
WITH THE ABSOLUTE CONVICTION

25:20.959 --> 25:22.834
THAT YOU'RE THE SMOOTHEST
THING SINCE BUTTER.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.959
IT'S TRUE. I FIND IT
AMUSING, ACTUALLY.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.417
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
WHY?

25:27.417 --> 25:30.875
'CAUSE IN REALITY,
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE
FEELING AND THINKING

25:30.875 --> 25:33.333
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
IS WRITTEN ALL OVER
YOUR FACE.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.792
OH, YEAH?
YEAH.

25:34.792 --> 25:36.375
AH!

25:36.375 --> 25:38.208
OK.

25:38.208 --> 25:41.834
WHAT'S WRITTEN
ALL OVER MY FACE
RIGHT NOW?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.792
MM, YOU'RE THINKING THAT
I'M THE MOST ATTRACTIVE
AND FORMIDABLE WOMAN

25:47.792 --> 25:49.417
YOU'VE EVER BEEN
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.375
THOUGH YOU'RE
TERRIFIED OF REJECTION,

25:52.375 --> 25:56.000
YOU LIKE ME AND
YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
OUT ON A PROPER DATE.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.875
[LAUGHS]

25:58.875 --> 25:59.792
NOPE.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.333
NO?
UH-UH.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.834
ACTUALLY,

26:02.834 --> 26:05.542
I WAS THINKING...

26:05.542 --> 26:06.542
THAT I WANT TO TAKE YOU
INTO THE BATHROOM

26:06.542 --> 26:09.750
AND DO UNGODLY THINGS
TO YOU.

26:12.792 --> 26:13.875
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

26:13.875 --> 26:16.333
NOTHING.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.542
NO. IT WAS A JOKE.
I--I WAS JOKING.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.500
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON DAWSON.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.166
I JUST BLEW IT,
DIDN'T I?

26:26.041 --> 26:29.208
OH! UHH!

26:29.208 --> 26:31.750
I AM THE DEVIL.
[LAUGHS]

26:31.750 --> 26:32.917
WELL, YOU READY?

26:32.917 --> 26:34.583
HELL, YEAH.
YOU SLEEPY?

26:34.583 --> 26:36.542
YEAH. YOU SEE THE
SIZE OF THE SCRIPT
OF THIS MONSTER?

26:36.542 --> 26:37.750
IT'S GONNA TAKE
12 OF THESE THINGS

26:37.750 --> 26:38.959
TO KEEP ME AWAKE
THROUGH THE MOVIE,

26:38.959 --> 26:39.917
WHICH MEANS
I'M PROBABLY

26:39.917 --> 26:41.208
GOING TO HAVE TO PEE
QUITE FREQUENTLY,

26:41.208 --> 26:42.542
WHICH IS
A GREAT EXCUSE
TO LEAVE THE THEATER

26:42.542 --> 26:43.792
WHEN CHARLIE
STARTS MAKING OUT
WITH AUDREY.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.583
OH HO, YOU REALLY HAVE IT BAD
FOR THIS GIRL, DON'T YOU?

26:45.583 --> 26:48.208
YEAH. WELL,
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

26:48.208 --> 26:49.625
SHE'S JUST NOT
LIKE ANY OTHER GIRL
I EVER MET BEFORE.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.667
AND SHE DOES NOT CARE
WHAT ANYBODY THINKS,
AND I DIG THAT, MAN.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.708
I REALLY DO.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S FUNNY,

26:56.708 --> 26:58.667
SHE HAS NO IDEA
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS,

26:58.667 --> 27:00.583
AND SHE'S ALWAYS SAYING
THE THING YOU DON'T
EXPECT, YOU KNOW?

27:00.583 --> 27:03.500
SHE'S CONSTANTLY
SURPRISING ME,
KEEPING ME ON MY TOES.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.500
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
RIGHT NOW,

27:06.500 --> 27:07.291
I BET SHE'S STANDING
RIGHT BEHIND ME,
ISN'T SHE?

27:07.291 --> 27:09.542
YEAH.
GREAT.

27:09.542 --> 27:12.250
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
I WANT TO BE HONEST.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.458
IT'S NOT 27. IT'S 57.

27:20.083 --> 27:24.291
ARE YOU OK? YOU'RE JUST
ACTING REALLY STRANGE.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.750
I'M NERVOUS.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.542
WHY? ABOUT
YOUR SCREENING?

27:28.542 --> 27:32.625
NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S THAT, UH...

27:32.625 --> 27:35.458
WELL...AHEM!

27:35.458 --> 27:38.291
EVER SINCE
YOU BROKE UP
WITH DAWSON,

27:38.291 --> 27:40.375
EVER SINCE
YOU BECAME...

27:40.375 --> 27:43.291
[GULPS]
AVAILABLE...

27:43.291 --> 27:46.959
I FIND THAT
I'M KIND OF...

27:46.959 --> 27:49.166
WELL, NERVOUS
AROUND YOU.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.083
OH.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.625
GOSH.

27:53.625 --> 27:55.458
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

27:55.458 --> 27:58.583
I...

27:58.583 --> 28:01.291
I'M JUST GONNA
GO AHEAD AND SAY THIS--

28:01.291 --> 28:04.041
THAT I DON'T THINK
THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

28:04.041 --> 28:07.875
OF SOMETHING HAPPENING
BETWEEN US RIGHT--EVER.

28:07.875 --> 28:11.083
UM, I'M JUST--
I'M SORRY.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.500
OH, GOD. YOU'RE
NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.875
OK. I'M GONNA GO.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.458
OHH.

28:20.458 --> 28:22.625
I--I KNOW THAT I'M
NOT PARTICULARLY SLICK

28:22.625 --> 28:27.834
OR, SAY, SOCIALLY ADEPT,

28:27.834 --> 28:31.041
AND I KNOW THAT
I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY

28:31.041 --> 28:35.291
THAT WOMEN
LOOK AT AND SAY,
"WHOA. CHECK HIM OUT."

28:35.291 --> 28:40.125
BUT I'M GONNA
BLOW YOUR MIND IN
A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS

28:40.125 --> 28:41.708
THAT YOU'VE
NEVER EVEN IMAGINED.

28:41.708 --> 28:42.625
OK, OLIVER--

28:42.625 --> 28:46.875
YOU KNOW IT, TOO,
AND YOU KNOW THAT

28:46.875 --> 28:49.125
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME,

28:49.125 --> 28:52.125
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT,

28:52.125 --> 28:55.041
WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE NOT TURNING
AROUND RIGHT NOW...

28:55.041 --> 28:58.542
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NERVOUS ABOUT
WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND.

28:58.542 --> 29:01.708
[EXHALES] JEEZ, UH,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

29:01.708 --> 29:03.875
TO YOUR SUDDEN, UM,

29:03.875 --> 29:07.834
AND PLENTIFUL, UH,
ENTHUSIASM AND CONFIDENCE,

29:07.834 --> 29:10.500
I AM GOING TO TURN AROUND
IN 3 SECONDS

29:10.500 --> 29:12.792
JUST TO PROVE THAT
YOU'RE WRONG. 1, 2, 3.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.625
JEEZ.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.917
IS THIS THING
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT?

29:30.917 --> 29:33.291
I DON'T KNOW. I
HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN HIM.

29:33.291 --> 29:33.875
SHOULD WE LOOK FOR HIM?

29:33.875 --> 29:36.041
I DON'T THINK SO.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.834
I'M GONNA GET SOME AIR.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.250
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.750
OK.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.083
JEN.

29:45.083 --> 29:45.500
JOEY.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.250
LINDLEY.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.792
POTTER.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.834
WOULD IT BE AWKWARD
IF I WERE TO ASK YOU

29:50.834 --> 29:52.834
A QUESTION
HAVING TO DO WITH BOYS?

29:52.834 --> 29:55.458
PROBABLY, BUT
DO YOU REALLY CARE?

29:55.458 --> 29:56.291
NO, NOT REALLY.

29:56.291 --> 29:59.083
OK. NEITHER DO I.
OK. UM...

29:59.083 --> 30:01.708
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
THE EXPERIENCE
OF MEETING A GUY

30:01.708 --> 30:05.000
WHO WAS REALLY GOOD-LOOKING
AND, I DON'T KNOW,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.291
KIND OF...

30:07.333 --> 30:08.500
CHARMING?

30:08.500 --> 30:10.375
YES, CHARMING.
VERY, VERY CHARMING,

30:10.375 --> 30:13.750
AND YOU ALMOST GET
HYPNOTIZED BY HOW CHARMING
AND GOOD-LOOKING HE IS,

30:13.750 --> 30:15.708
BUT WHEN YOU
PENETRATE THE SURFACE,
EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT,

30:15.708 --> 30:17.083
YOU FIND THAT HE'S...

30:17.083 --> 30:18.333
A MORON?

30:18.333 --> 30:19.625
I WAS GONNA SAY "LOSER."

30:19.625 --> 30:23.125
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH
EVERY SINGLE GUY
THAT I'VE EVER DATED

30:23.125 --> 30:23.667
WITH THE EXCEPTION--

30:23.667 --> 30:26.625
DAWSON.
YEAH.

30:29.417 --> 30:30.750
[SIGHS]

30:30.750 --> 30:33.500
CAN I SAY
SOMETHING?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.959
OF COURSE.

30:34.959 --> 30:38.333
MY GRAMS IS DATING
A 60-YEAR-OLD
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN

30:38.333 --> 30:39.125
WHOSE NAME
IS CLIFTON SMALLS.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.000
WHAT?

30:43.583 --> 30:44.667
I GUESS
THAT'S A GOOD THING?

30:44.667 --> 30:48.500
IT IS. ACTUALLY,
IT'S A REALLY
GREAT THING.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.834
DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY?

30:49.834 --> 30:51.166
I GUESS SO.

30:51.166 --> 30:53.667
IT'S A GREAT THING
BECAUSE IT MEANS

30:53.667 --> 30:56.500
THAT NO MATTER HOW
MANY GOOD-LOOKING BOYS

30:56.500 --> 30:57.417
CONSISTENTLY
DISAPPOINT US

30:57.417 --> 31:00.458
OR HOW MANY TIMES
WE'RE CONVINCED

31:00.458 --> 31:03.125
THAT THIS UNIVERSE IS
GOING TO BEGIN AND END

31:03.125 --> 31:05.250
WITH ONE OF
THESE MORONIC LOSERS,

31:05.250 --> 31:08.250
THAT SOMEDAY WHEN ALL OF
THIS CRAP IS OVER WITH,

31:08.250 --> 31:12.708
THERE MIGHT BE OUR
VERY OWN CLIFTON SMALLS
WAITING FOR US.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.083
YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.750
THANKS.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.250
I THOUGHT SO.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.625
BUT THAT'S A LONG TIME.

31:23.625 --> 31:26.125
OK, SO TELL ME, DAWSON,

31:26.125 --> 31:28.542
WHY SHOULD I STAY
AND SEE THIS MOVIE
OF YOURS? CONVINCE ME.

31:28.542 --> 31:31.250
HONESTLY, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY YOU SHOULD COME
SEE THIS MOVIE.

31:31.250 --> 31:34.708
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S GOOD OR NOT.
I MEAN, IT'S...

31:34.708 --> 31:38.458
OLIVER LOVES IT,
BUT, LET'S FACE IT:
HE MIGHT BE MILDLY INSANE.

31:38.458 --> 31:40.375
MY BEST FRIEND JOEY
REALLY LIKED IT,

31:40.375 --> 31:43.041
BUT SHE MIGHT
JUST BE IMPRESSED
THAT IT'S IN FOCUS.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.583
WE WORKED HARD ON IT,

31:45.583 --> 31:47.417
REALLY HARD.
THAT MUCH I'M SURE OF.

31:47.417 --> 31:48.125
UM...

31:48.125 --> 31:50.500
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I...

31:50.500 --> 31:52.667
WHAT?

31:53.917 --> 31:56.333
I SHOULDN'T
BE TELLING YOU THIS,

31:56.333 --> 31:59.000
BUT I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE
THAT IT'S DONE.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.208
I MEAN, ALL THE PIECES
ARE THERE.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.291
ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE THERE,

32:02.291 --> 32:05.792
BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT IT JUST KINDA--

32:05.792 --> 32:07.417
IT JUST KINDA
FEELS INCOMPLETE.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.333
LET ME ASK YOU THIS:
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

32:10.333 --> 32:14.917
UM, IT'S A LOVE STORY
ABOUT A GIRL WHO MAY
OR MAY NOT BE A COKE FIEND.

32:14.917 --> 32:16.083
NOT--NOT THE STORY.

32:16.083 --> 32:18.417
WHAT'S IT ABOUT? LIKE,
WHAT'S IT ABOUT TO YOU?

32:21.625 --> 32:23.375
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

32:23.375 --> 32:29.917
I'VE HAD THIS TRULY BIZARRE,
LIFE-ALTERING YEAR. I--

32:29.917 --> 32:32.708
I DROPPED OUT OF USC
TO BE WITH THIS GIRL

32:32.708 --> 32:34.208
WHO I'VE LOVED
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

32:34.208 --> 32:34.875
FOR PRETTY MUCH
MY WHOLE LIFE,

32:34.875 --> 32:37.125
AND THEN MY FATHER DIED,

32:37.125 --> 32:40.542
WHICH COMPLETELY ROCKED
MY UNIVERSE,

32:40.542 --> 32:42.291
AND THEN I JUMPED HEADFIRST
INTO THIS REALLY INTENSE
RELATIONSHIP

32:42.291 --> 32:44.625
WITH THIS OTHER GIRL,
AND WE JUST BROKE UP,

32:44.625 --> 32:49.500
AND--AND THE MOVIE
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF THESE THINGS,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.125
BUT IN A WAY, IT HAS TO DO
WITH ALL OF THEM.

32:51.125 --> 32:55.250
I FEEL LIKE I PUT EVERYTHING
THAT I AM INTO MAKING THIS FILM.

32:57.750 --> 32:58.834
I'M SORRY. I'M RAMBLING.

32:58.834 --> 33:00.250
DON'T BE SORRY.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.208
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A MOVIE I WOULD
REALLY LIKE TO SEE.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.792
REALLY?

33:04.792 --> 33:08.792
YES. ANYTHING IMBUED
WITH THAT MUCH PASSION
AND HEARTBREAK

33:08.792 --> 33:10.750
SOUNDS
FAR MORE INTERESTING
THAN HALF THE DRECK

33:10.750 --> 33:13.792
THAT'S CURRENTLY
TAKING UP SPACE IN OUR
NATION'S MULTIPLEXES.

33:13.792 --> 33:17.166
PLUS, YOU'RE A FAN,
WHICH SATISFIES
MY ENORMOUS EGO.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.208
SHALL WE?

33:20.208 --> 33:21.166
YEAH. LET'S GO.

33:23.792 --> 33:24.792
ALL RIGHT.

33:24.792 --> 33:25.834
OH, MY GOD.

33:25.834 --> 33:26.750
WHAT?

33:26.750 --> 33:27.792
MY BOYFRIEND.

33:27.792 --> 33:28.625
WHERE?

33:28.625 --> 33:29.750
OVER THERE.
UH, DO ME A FAVOR.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.208
SURE.
KISS ME.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.208
WHAT?

33:32.208 --> 33:32.333
KISS ME. KISS ME.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.667
DID HE SEE?

33:49.667 --> 33:50.458
I DON'T KNOW.

33:50.458 --> 33:53.250
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE HE IS.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.375
OH. [LAUGHS]

33:56.375 --> 33:58.583
I'M REALLY SORRY,
DAWSON.

33:58.583 --> 33:59.750
WHY?

33:59.750 --> 34:01.250
WELL, IT'S NOT EVEN HIM.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.834
IT JUST REALLY
LOOKS LIKE HIM.
SAME JACKET, SORT OF.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.041
OH.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.708
REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

34:06.708 --> 34:08.041
DON'T BE.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.542
LET'S...

34:10.542 --> 34:12.083
GO.

34:24.875 --> 34:26.250
SO I'VE
BEEN THINKIN'--

34:26.250 --> 34:28.041
PACEY, BEFORE YOU
SAY ANYTHING--

34:28.041 --> 34:30.375
COULD YOU SHUT UP FOR
JUST A SECOND, PLEASE?

34:30.375 --> 34:31.875
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHAT I'M THINKIN' HERE,

34:31.875 --> 34:33.125
AND IT'S INTERESTING
THIS TIME.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.166
OK. I'M SORRY.

34:35.166 --> 34:38.000
OK.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.208
SO...

34:40.208 --> 34:42.542
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE SLEPT
WITH OTHER MEN.

34:42.542 --> 34:43.667
I KNEW THAT YOU
HAD SLEPT WITH OTHER MEN

34:43.667 --> 34:45.875
BEFORE I STARTED THIS
WHOLE PATHETIC INQUIRY.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.083
I KNEW THAT YOU
HAD SLEPT WITH OTHER MEN

34:47.083 --> 34:48.083
BEFORE YOU AND I STARTED
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.833
SO, FINE. YOU HAVE SLEPT
WITH OTHER MEN.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.291
I CAN ACCEPT THAT.

34:51.291 --> 34:53.583
OF COURSE, I KNOW DEEP
DOWN IN MY HEART THAT
YOU DIDN'T ENJOY IT,

34:53.583 --> 34:54.583
BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

34:54.583 --> 34:55.750
[CHUCKLES]

34:55.750 --> 34:56.958
THE POINT IS--

34:56.958 --> 34:58.583
WHAT'S THE POINT?

34:58.583 --> 35:03.083
THE POINT
IS THAT I HAVE MY FEARS
AND MY INSECURITIES,

35:03.083 --> 35:05.708
BUT THEY'RE MINE,
NOT YOURS.

35:05.708 --> 35:06.875
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.917
THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS IS THIS.

35:08.917 --> 35:10.875
JUST THIS.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.708
JUST THIS.

35:12.708 --> 35:14.583
YES.

35:14.583 --> 35:18.750
I HAVE TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY
FALLEN FOR YOU.

35:20.041 --> 35:23.875
MMM. YOU MOVE ME,
AUDREY.

35:23.875 --> 35:26.458
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.667
5.

35:34.375 --> 35:35.875
WHAT?

35:35.875 --> 35:38.542
I'VE ONLY SLEPT
WITH 5 PEOPLE.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.208
REALLY?

35:41.208 --> 35:42.125
YEAH.

35:42.125 --> 35:44.625
I MEAN, IT'S OK,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

35:44.625 --> 35:46.291
JOEY HAS TOLD ME
A COUPLE OF THINGS,

35:46.291 --> 35:47.708
AND I'VE
ACTUALLY SEEN YOU
WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT--

35:47.708 --> 35:50.542
ALL RIGHT, I MAY HAVE...

35:50.542 --> 35:53.291
AT TIMES, BEEN...

35:53.291 --> 35:55.458
SOMEWHAT
OF A MAKE-OUT SLUT.

35:55.458 --> 35:58.458
I HAVE KISSED
A LOT OF BOYS,

35:58.458 --> 36:01.417
AND I FIGURE
THAT YOU HAVE TO.

36:01.417 --> 36:02.542
YOU KNOW, THAT WAY,

36:02.542 --> 36:04.792
YOU SORTA KNOW WHEN
YOU'VE FOUND THE RIGHT ONE.

36:04.792 --> 36:07.250
I LIKE THAT LOGIC.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.417
YOU WERE TESTING ME.

36:13.417 --> 36:15.959
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
HOW I'D REACT.

36:15.959 --> 36:16.875
YEAH.

36:16.875 --> 36:20.834
MAYBE. A LITTLE.

36:20.834 --> 36:24.375
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY, PACEY.

36:24.375 --> 36:28.250
IT'S JUST I GUESS THAT
I HAVE MY OWN FEARS, TOO,

36:28.250 --> 36:31.208
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK I JUST...

36:31.208 --> 36:33.542
NEEDED TO HEAR IT.

36:33.542 --> 36:34.792
DID I PASS?

36:34.792 --> 36:37.875
WELL, YOU ACED,

36:37.875 --> 36:39.792
AND YOU MAY EVEN
GET A REWARD.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.333
REALLY?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.667
WELL...

36:43.667 --> 36:46.667
SO LONG AS I RETAIN
THE FULL RANGE OF MOTION
FROM THE NECK UP,

36:46.667 --> 36:48.125
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.625
I MEAN, WHY DO I
EVEN CARE?

36:51.625 --> 36:52.917
I DON'T EVEN
LIKE THIS GUY.

36:52.917 --> 36:54.834
I CAN BARELY
HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH HIM

36:54.834 --> 36:55.959
WITHOUT WANTING TO
CLAW HIS EYES OUT.

36:55.959 --> 36:58.917
YOU'RE VERY VIOLENT.
ANYBODY EVER TOLD YOU THAT?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.250
HA HA HA! SHUT UP.

37:00.250 --> 37:04.291
ANY RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT EASY WHEN YOU
KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT.

37:04.291 --> 37:07.625
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
TO BE SAID FOR COMFORT
AND SAFETY.

37:07.625 --> 37:10.208
YOU KNOW, THAT THING
OF JUST HAVING SOMEBODY
AROUND TO COME HOME TO,

37:10.208 --> 37:11.792
TO TALK TO, TO TOUCH.

37:11.792 --> 37:13.041
EVEN IF IT'S NOT
ABOUT THAT PERSON,

37:13.041 --> 37:14.875
BUT HAVING THAT STABILIZING
FORCE IN YOUR LIFE.

37:14.875 --> 37:15.542
I GUESS SO.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.250
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE:

37:17.250 --> 37:23.000
THIS MOVIE, FOR ME,
IT KINDA HELD MY LIFE TOGETHER

37:23.000 --> 37:24.708
AT A TIME
WHEN I NEEDED IT MOST.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.583
IT FORCED ME TO BE BRAVE,
AND IT MADE ME STRONG.

37:27.583 --> 37:29.417
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
AN INSIGHT HERE.

37:29.417 --> 37:30.750
OK.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.083
IT'S NOT
THE MOVIE YOU'RE AFRAID
ISN'T COMPLETE.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.250
IT'S YOU, AND YOU
SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THAT

37:34.250 --> 37:37.208
BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT COMPLETE, NOT YET.

37:37.208 --> 37:39.166
IN FACT,
YOU MAY NEVER BE.

37:39.166 --> 37:41.250
BUT YOU
KEEP LOOKING, AND
YOU KEEP MAKING MOVIES,

37:41.250 --> 37:43.250
AND YOU KEEP
SHOWING THEM TO PEOPLE,

37:43.250 --> 37:45.125
AND THAT'S WHAT
BEING A FILMMAKER IS.

37:45.125 --> 37:46.041
GOOD INSIGHT.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.458
I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.500
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
GO WATCH OURSELVES
A MOVIE?

37:54.250 --> 37:57.583
OK, BUT WHAT IF IT SUCKS?
WHAT IF I COMPLETELY
WASTED MY TIME?

37:57.583 --> 38:00.083
IF IT SUCKS,
I WILL TELL YOU
OVER COFFEE,

38:00.083 --> 38:02.125
AND YOU MIGHT
JUST GET TO MAKE OUT
WITH ME AGAIN.

38:02.125 --> 38:04.667
BY THE WAY,
MINE IS ROAD HOUSE...

38:04.667 --> 38:07.834
WITH PATRICK SWAYZE?

38:07.834 --> 38:09.250
I'VE SEEN IT, LIKE 37 TIMES.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.917
EVERY TIME IT'S ON TV,
I HAVE TO WATCH IT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.708
I OWN THE TAPE. I LOVE IT.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.750
HA HA HA!
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.959
COME ON.

38:24.583 --> 38:28.041
OH, MY GOSH,
YOU DID IT.
YOU GOT HER BACK.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.375
HOW DID YOU
GET HER BACK?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.291
I MADE OUT WITH HER.

38:48.041 --> 38:50.500
I NEED A FAVOR.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.208
WHO'S ASKING?

38:52.208 --> 38:53.792
IS IT THE SLIGHTLY
VULNERABLE,

38:53.792 --> 38:55.500
KIND OF
EMBARRASSING BOY
I SAT DOWN WITH,

38:55.500 --> 38:57.291
OR IS IT THE REALLY
OBNOXIOUS SLEAZEBALL
I WALKED AWAY FROM?

38:57.291 --> 39:00.041
OK, THAT'S FAIR.
I DESERVE THAT.

39:00.041 --> 39:02.125
IT'S NOT AN INSULT.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.000
IT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION.
WHICH GUY ARE YOU?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.917
I'D KINDA
LIKE TO KNOW BEFORE I
ACTUALLY START TO CARE.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.125
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.834
I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

39:09.834 --> 39:13.583
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
WHEN I CAME HERE TONIGHT,

39:13.583 --> 39:17.083
YOU WERE DIFFERENT WITH ME
THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE.

39:17.083 --> 39:19.708
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.

39:19.708 --> 39:23.333
THAT WASN'T YOU.
I WAS...

39:23.333 --> 39:24.291
CONFUSED.

39:24.291 --> 39:25.667
OK, WHATEVER.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.208
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

39:27.208 --> 39:30.667
BECAUSE WHATEVER IT WAS,
I SCREWED IT UP.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.375
I TRIED TO BE FUNNY,
AND I WASN'T.

39:32.375 --> 39:35.750
I MEAN, I WAS COMPLETELY--
I WAS OPPOSITE OF FUNNY,

39:35.750 --> 39:41.125
AND I THINK THE REASON THAT
I WAS SO COMPLETELY UNFUNNY,

39:41.125 --> 39:42.125
IS BECAUSE...

39:42.125 --> 39:45.041
I DO WANNA ASK YOU OUT.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.000
VERY MUCH.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.750
VERY, VERY MUCH.

39:49.750 --> 39:53.166
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU--
[CHUCKLES]

39:53.166 --> 39:55.417
YOU--YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.125
I KNOW I DO.

39:59.125 --> 40:02.000
I WANT TO BE
THAT FIRST GUY, JOEY.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.333
YOU MAKE ME
WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.875
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAVOR?

40:06.875 --> 40:08.875
OK.

40:09.250 --> 40:11.291
[SIGHS]

40:11.291 --> 40:13.583
WELL, I WAS HOPING
THAT MAYBE YOU MIGHT
LET ME SIT NEXT TO YOU,

40:13.583 --> 40:18.417
AND THEN, POSSIBLY,
IF I JUST SAT THERE,

40:18.417 --> 40:20.333
THEN, MAYBE...

40:20.333 --> 40:26.291
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO MAKE YOU LIKE ME, WELL,

40:26.291 --> 40:28.875
MAYBE IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:40.625 --> 40:42.750
DON'T GET
YOUR HOPES UP.

40:42.750 --> 40:43.166
[CHUCKLES]

40:43.166 --> 40:44.542
TOO LATE.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.875
OH, MY GOD.

41:03.875 --> 41:07.000
WHAT?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.125
NOTHING. I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

41:09.125 --> 41:11.125
YEAH, YOU DID.
YOU SAID, "OH, MY GOD."

41:11.125 --> 41:12.542
SHUT UP. I DIDN'T, OK?

41:12.542 --> 41:14.834
I'M JUST SITTING HERE,
QUIETLY WAITING FOR
THE MOVIE TO START.

41:14.834 --> 41:16.291
OK.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.291
AHEM!

41:32.291 --> 41:34.125
Dawson: ALL RIGHT.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.959
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE DELAY, FOLKS.

41:36.959 --> 41:39.458
MY SINCERE APOLOGIES,
BUT I THINK WE'RE READY,

41:39.458 --> 41:41.291
AND WE'RE GONNA
SHOW THIS THING,

41:41.291 --> 41:44.500
SO...HERE'S THE DEAL:

41:44.500 --> 41:46.708
IT'S TOO LONG,
THE MUSIC IS TEMP,

41:46.708 --> 41:49.458
THE MIX IS UNFINISHED,
TRANSFER IS UGLY,

41:49.458 --> 41:52.208
WE STILL DON'T
HAVE A TITLE, BUT, UH...

41:53.875 --> 41:56.959
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
IS A LABOR OF LOVE,

41:56.959 --> 41:58.542
AND NOT JUST
FOR OLIVER AND MYSELF,

41:58.542 --> 41:59.500
BUT FOR EVERYBODY
IN THIS ROOM

41:59.500 --> 42:00.333
WHO GAVE OF THEIR TIME
AND THEIR ENERGY

42:00.333 --> 42:02.000
AND THEIR TALENT.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.959
AND, UH...

42:05.959 --> 42:07.667
WE MIGHT BE THE ONLY PEOPLE

42:07.667 --> 42:09.834
TO EVER SEE THIS THING
UP ON THE SCREEN,

42:09.834 --> 42:11.625
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

42:11.625 --> 42:14.333
BECAUSE IT IS
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE

42:14.333 --> 42:17.083
A SNAPSHOT OF WHO WE ARE
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT
IN TIME.

42:17.083 --> 42:20.000
SO...

42:24.542 --> 42:25.708
BRACE YOURSELVES.

42:28.291 --> 42:28.708
ROLL IT.
