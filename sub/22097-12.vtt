00:02.810 --> 00:05.005
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:36.577 --> 00:37.942
Like my new toy?

00:38.012 --> 00:39.240
It's my very own Cylon Raider.

00:39.347 --> 00:42.976
Boy, when you take a souvenir,
you don't screw around.

00:46.253 --> 00:50.212
Congratulations, Doctor. You've
just uncovered your very first Cylon.

00:50.391 --> 00:52.188
<i>She probably doesn't know.</i>

00:52.593 --> 00:54.493
If something
happened to you...

00:54.562 --> 00:56.359
I wouldn't know
how to deal with it.

00:56.430 --> 00:57.954
I feel the same way.

01:00.801 --> 01:02.029
I'm a Cylon.

01:02.703 --> 01:06.230
Helo, come with me. Helo.

01:07.575 --> 01:09.440
Helo, come with me!

01:09.543 --> 01:12.034
New piece of equipment
that just appeared in CIC.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.740
He had this when we found him.

01:13.814 --> 01:16.078
<i>Send it back to Galactica.
The lab can look at it.</i>

01:16.150 --> 01:17.412
It's a Cylon device.

01:17.585 --> 01:20.918
I'll continue to take the
Chamalla. It has other benefits.

01:21.722 --> 01:23.246
The hallucinations?

01:23.324 --> 01:24.791
You're going to find Kobol.

01:24.892 --> 01:26.757
Birthplace of us all.

01:27.061 --> 01:31.225
He says we're gonna find Kobol, and
that it's gonna lead us to Earth.

02:00.895 --> 02:02.385
You all right?

03:06.594 --> 03:08.152
You all right?

03:26.981 --> 03:29.040
Stop! Don't come any closer.

03:50.337 --> 03:51.736
Just do it.

04:15.196 --> 04:17.596
Oh, Lee!

04:46.493 --> 04:47.653
Oh, God.

05:01.809 --> 05:04.778
<i>Attention.
Pass the word for Lt. Valerii.</i>

05:05.045 --> 05:08.845
<i>Lt. Valerii, report to the Ready
Room for a pre-flight briefing.</i>

05:24.431 --> 05:26.365
You don't lose control.

05:26.533 --> 05:27.761
Thanks.

05:29.403 --> 05:30.427
No.

05:31.405 --> 05:34.932
You got to lose control.
Let your instincts take over.

05:35.109 --> 05:37.407
I thought we were
just sparring.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.373
That's why you don't win.

08:23.342 --> 08:26.675
The doctor said I
have six months at the outside.

08:30.216 --> 08:33.674
He said the cancer's moved
into my lymphatic system.

08:34.754 --> 08:36.722
Aggressively moved in.

08:41.761 --> 08:44.093
I want you to hear me on this.

08:46.332 --> 08:48.892
You made a true believer
out of me.

08:49.235 --> 08:51.931
Strange as that sounds,
considering.

08:52.738 --> 08:54.228
But I believe.

08:55.608 --> 08:58.941
I know you're the one
to lead us to our salvation.

08:59.912 --> 09:03.245
You are going to
guide us to Earth.

09:08.187 --> 09:10.451
Then we better find it soon.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.954
I'm out.
Like it's yours.

09:16.028 --> 09:18.223
I picked up your five.
Frankly, I don't care.

09:18.297 --> 09:21.425
No, thank you, Doctor,
I have a watch later.

09:21.534 --> 09:22.933
Crashdown hits. Davis?

09:23.002 --> 09:24.162
What?

09:24.236 --> 09:27.000
A little bit of this.
A little bit of that.

09:27.073 --> 09:28.802
You guys always play this slow?

09:28.874 --> 09:30.068
What did you say?

09:30.176 --> 09:32.303
Don't distract me.

09:32.378 --> 09:33.811
Uncanny, I know.

09:33.879 --> 09:37.178
All right, 20, I call.
And I raise you another 30.

09:38.551 --> 09:40.712
You can't compete with me.

09:41.854 --> 09:43.344
I always win.

09:43.989 --> 09:45.149
I'm sorry.

09:45.758 --> 09:48.352
Never seen you like this, Gaius.

09:48.728 --> 09:51.026
It's disappointing somehow.

09:51.731 --> 09:53.028
Common.

09:56.736 --> 09:59.330
So sorry to disappoint you.

10:01.474 --> 10:03.305
Disappoint you all.

10:03.876 --> 10:05.138
Thirty.

10:07.146 --> 10:08.636
And I call it.

10:09.448 --> 10:11.313
What do you got, buddy?

10:11.417 --> 10:13.408
Absolutely nothing.
Not bad, Crash.

10:13.486 --> 10:15.078
But not compared to that.

10:15.154 --> 10:16.644
Oh! You are...

10:17.656 --> 10:19.817
No!
You win every time.

10:19.925 --> 10:22.587
Sorry, I have to do it.

10:23.229 --> 10:25.163
Very sorry
to disappoint you.

10:25.264 --> 10:27.630
There's a card game... Hey.

10:27.733 --> 10:30.668
She's back on her feet,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.240
How are you
feeling? Hey, Gaius.

10:36.308 --> 10:37.332
Good.

10:37.409 --> 10:41.106
Mr. Vice President,
if you don't mind, Lt. Thrace.

10:41.547 --> 10:46.507
Some level of decorum must be maintained,
or is it a pirate ship you're running?

10:47.119 --> 10:49.246
No. Just a Battlestar, sir.

10:49.522 --> 10:51.251
All right, let's play.

10:52.124 --> 10:54.024
Would you like to play?

10:54.193 --> 10:57.253
Maybe you'd like to
sit next to Capt. Adama?

10:57.396 --> 11:00.126
Sure, Kara.
Why don't you pull up a pew?

11:00.266 --> 11:03.429
No, that's okay, Lee.
I've got things to do.

11:03.803 --> 11:06.135
Nothing's wild. Here we go.

11:15.781 --> 11:16.975
All right, currency.

11:17.049 --> 11:19.950
While bartering will continue
for the foreseeable future...

11:20.019 --> 11:23.546
we do have a system in place
now to take the economy back...

11:23.622 --> 11:25.214
to a currency-based
standard.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.952
Do you love her?

11:27.760 --> 11:29.125
Did you...

11:31.297 --> 11:32.958
Dr. Baltar...

11:34.567 --> 11:36.330
if something should
happen to me,

11:36.402 --> 11:38.029
it is vital that you
comprehend...

11:38.103 --> 11:42.267
and are familiar with the political
structures beginning to fall into place here.

11:42.374 --> 11:44.968
Do you understand this?
Answer me.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.641
Yes, of course
I understand.

11:48.314 --> 11:49.941
My answer is no.

11:50.115 --> 11:52.481
No, I don't think
I can handle this right now.

11:52.585 --> 11:56.578
The intricacies of the bureaucracy,
I can't get my head around.

11:56.822 --> 11:59.655
This which, with all due
respect, Madam President...

11:59.758 --> 12:04.388
you have spent your entire political
career learning to understand.

12:04.463 --> 12:05.521
More to the point...

12:05.631 --> 12:08.998
how you could think that my head
could be turned so quickly...

12:09.101 --> 12:10.966
by a new thing...

12:13.372 --> 12:15.863
it just astounds me.

12:18.010 --> 12:21.844
How did you seriously think I could
cope with this kind of responsibility?

12:21.947 --> 12:23.278
I don't believe you.

12:23.349 --> 12:25.317
You're a genius,
are you not?

12:25.384 --> 12:28.615
Well, quite frankly,
I don't give a flying frack...

12:28.687 --> 12:32.316
whether you believe me or not.
All right? Because I've had it.

12:32.625 --> 12:37.585
I am tired of being pushed and prodded
around like I'm some kind of toy.

12:37.963 --> 12:40.830
I'm not your plaything.
Plaything?

12:42.067 --> 12:43.625
I don't work for you!

12:43.702 --> 12:46.364
And quite frankly, I don't
have to sit here anymore...

12:46.438 --> 12:49.532
and take this kind of abuse
from either of you!

12:50.042 --> 12:51.100
You either!

12:51.176 --> 12:53.041
Either in here,
either in there.

12:53.112 --> 12:55.080
Wherever it is,
I don't need to take it.

12:55.381 --> 12:57.941
I love you, Gaius.
Do me a favor.

12:58.517 --> 12:59.745
Yeah?

12:59.952 --> 13:03.854
I think perhaps you
need a break from this.

13:04.757 --> 13:06.224
You're right.

13:08.861 --> 13:10.624
We need a break.

13:29.748 --> 13:32.148
I'd like to be alone
if you don't mind.

13:33.519 --> 13:36.488
How can you love her, Gaius?
I don't.

13:36.588 --> 13:40.388
You can't lie to me,
I know everything you know.

13:50.803 --> 13:52.464
That's lovely.

13:53.138 --> 13:54.537
Thank you.

13:55.975 --> 13:57.306
Did you...

13:58.377 --> 14:01.505
Did you want something
in particular this time?

14:01.613 --> 14:03.774
I thought you should know...

14:03.949 --> 14:06.850
<i>that it's not safe
to remain on Galactica.</i>

14:07.987 --> 14:10.148
What are you talking about?

14:11.190 --> 14:12.919
It's a surprise.

14:13.592 --> 14:17.323
Tell me, what is it?
What is it?

14:18.030 --> 14:21.193
Is it a bomb?
Another Cylon bomb, right?

14:23.235 --> 14:24.862
Is it an agent?

14:25.237 --> 14:28.365
Is a Cylon agent
about to be activated?

14:29.341 --> 14:30.740
Tell me!

14:41.286 --> 14:43.117
<i>Galactica, this is Raptor 1</i>

14:43.188 --> 14:44.746
<i>preparing to jump
to Sector 728.</i>

14:45.557 --> 14:47.991
<i>Let's hope we find
some supplies out there.</i>

14:48.093 --> 14:51.062
<i>Roger that.
Good hunting out there.</i>

14:51.163 --> 14:53.290
Crash, counter our spinner.

14:53.499 --> 14:55.296
FTL drive's spun up
and ready.

14:55.401 --> 14:59.599
Jump in five, four,
three, two, one.

15:03.108 --> 15:04.598
Whoa, baby!

15:07.613 --> 15:09.274
Frack me!

15:16.755 --> 15:19.223
Gaeta, the fracking idiot.

15:20.459 --> 15:24.156
You can't plan a jump that close to
a planet. What if we jumped into it?

15:24.263 --> 15:27.528
It was great. It's fine.
We made it. We're cool.

15:42.614 --> 15:45.378
Are you seeing this?
Yeah.

15:50.689 --> 15:52.088
Oceans.

15:52.925 --> 15:54.222
Continents.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.653
No. Let me at this thing.

16:00.032 --> 16:03.968
Okay.
The atmosphere reads as...

16:05.037 --> 16:08.564
Nitrogen, oxygen. Looks like
enough CO2 for green leafy things.

16:08.674 --> 16:11.302
I'm starting to get
excited here, Boomer.

16:11.443 --> 16:12.705
Boomer, this could be it.

16:12.778 --> 16:17.647
This could be the big one. This is the
little planet that solves all of our problems.

16:18.217 --> 16:19.616
Boomer?

16:21.787 --> 16:24.051
Do you think this is Earth?

16:25.090 --> 16:26.887
No. It's not Earth.

16:28.293 --> 16:30.488
It's more important than that.

16:56.687 --> 16:59.485
Doesn't really work
as well as before, huh?

17:03.994 --> 17:06.428
You know, I do get cold.

17:11.735 --> 17:13.532
There's some things
you should know, Helo.

17:13.604 --> 17:15.435
Don't call me that.

17:16.474 --> 17:18.203
You're not even Sharon.

17:18.275 --> 17:20.903
You're not even human. So
don't act like you know me...

17:20.978 --> 17:22.138
because you don't!

17:22.213 --> 17:25.842
But I am Sharon! And that's part
of what you need to understand!

17:28.519 --> 17:30.817
Sharon was a friend of mine!

17:31.489 --> 17:35.687
Whatever twisted thing you are,
you are not Sharon! You got that?

17:36.093 --> 17:40.723
The only thing I want from you is a way
off this fracked up world. That's it!

17:50.674 --> 17:52.266
Going hunting?

17:55.012 --> 17:57.378
I'm adding a gunnery run
to the jump test tomorrow.

17:57.448 --> 18:00.884
See if our boy here, can
shoot anything with our ammo.

18:01.185 --> 18:03.016
So it's a boy now?

18:04.088 --> 18:05.851
I changed my mind.

18:06.190 --> 18:10.524
You ever wonder why everyone calls
it a she, but to you, it's a he?

18:10.761 --> 18:13.855
It's fascinating, Lee.
You should write a paper.

18:14.031 --> 18:16.090
It's not really my scene.

18:16.300 --> 18:20.134
I'm not as smart as,
say, Dr. Baltar.

18:24.408 --> 18:26.433
How is the Vice President,
by the way?

18:26.510 --> 18:28.910
I don't know.
Haven't seen him.

18:32.016 --> 18:35.452
So he's a "love them and leave
them" kind of guy, I guess.

18:35.586 --> 18:36.951
I guess.

18:40.324 --> 18:43.293
Ships just pass in the night.
Yup.

18:45.496 --> 18:47.088
Didn't mean a thing.

18:47.798 --> 18:50.631
Nope. Just bored. Looking
for something to do.

18:50.701 --> 18:54.262
So fracking the Vice President seemed
like a great way to waste some time.

18:54.338 --> 18:56.306
You want something from me?
Not a thing.

18:56.373 --> 18:58.898
I don't owe you anything.
You don't owe me anything.

18:59.009 --> 19:01.170
Because I'm just a CAG,
and you're just a pilot.

19:01.245 --> 19:04.373
Right. A pilot that
can't keep her pants on!

19:05.516 --> 19:06.710
Right.

19:07.451 --> 19:09.442
It's just like old times,
Kara.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.920
Like when you got drunk and couldn't keep
your hands off the major from wherever...

19:16.193 --> 19:17.353
God!

19:23.534 --> 19:26.002
Why did you do it, Kara?
Just tell me why.

19:26.070 --> 19:29.267
Because I'm a screw-up, Lee.
Try and keep that in mind.

19:33.944 --> 19:36.435
Commander Adama is
sending out another Raptor...

19:36.547 --> 19:38.572
to conduct an aerial survey
of this planet.

19:38.682 --> 19:41.879
It appears to have suffered
some sort of calamity...

19:41.952 --> 19:44.614
but it could actually
be inhabitable.

19:45.322 --> 19:48.985
Aerial survey shows evidence of
at least one city on the surface.

19:49.126 --> 19:51.094
It was obviously abandoned
a long time ago.

19:51.161 --> 19:52.753
How old are the ruins?

19:53.063 --> 19:55.327
We won't know for sure
until we send a ground team...

19:55.399 --> 19:57.458
but the initial estimates
have it...

19:57.568 --> 20:00.298
on the order of
approximately 2,000 years.

20:00.404 --> 20:03.737
That's around the time the
13 Tribes first left Kobol.

20:03.907 --> 20:05.704
Let me see.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.009
Ruins? What ruins?

20:15.819 --> 20:18.014
This is an inhabited city.

20:20.090 --> 20:21.614
Look at the buildings.

20:24.795 --> 20:26.285
Buildings?

20:27.798 --> 20:29.231
Look.

20:42.813 --> 20:46.772
What did you see?
Tell me, Laura.

20:57.861 --> 21:02.195
A dome-like structure with six
roads leading out of it like spokes.

21:02.366 --> 21:05.267
With something around it like
columns, like a forum,

21:05.335 --> 21:07.269
like the forum on Caprica,
actually.

21:21.919 --> 21:26.822
The forum in the opera house in
the city of the gods on Kobol.

21:33.263 --> 21:37.199
This planet is Kobol.

21:43.907 --> 21:46.137
Kobol like Kobol?

21:46.376 --> 21:48.401
The birthplace of mankind.

21:48.612 --> 21:50.807
Where the gods and man
lived in paradise.

21:51.048 --> 21:54.245
Until the exodus of
the 13 Tribes.

22:06.396 --> 22:09.126
Madam President,
what's going on?

22:16.740 --> 22:21.336
It's real. The scriptures, the myths,
the prophecies. They're all real.

22:22.646 --> 22:24.773
So say we all.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.497
Hello, Lieutenant.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.300
Hey, Doc.

22:59.983 --> 23:02.110
This is a bad time, right?

23:02.452 --> 23:05.285
No. I'm just cleaning my gun.

23:09.626 --> 23:11.321
What's going on?

23:12.029 --> 23:14.964
I was going to ask you
the same question.

23:15.098 --> 23:18.499
Actually, I was looking
for Lt. Thrace.

23:25.943 --> 23:29.401
But sometimes, it's good
to talk these things over.

23:29.947 --> 23:32.142
Deep down, she
knows she's a Cylon.

23:33.116 --> 23:35.949
But her conscious mind
won't accept it.

23:36.687 --> 23:39.451
Sometimes I have
these dark thoughts.

23:40.991 --> 23:44.358
What kind of dark thoughts?
Her model is weak.

23:46.997 --> 23:48.692
Always has been.

23:49.199 --> 23:51.929
But in the end,
she'll carry out her mission.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.494
I don't know.

23:55.272 --> 23:58.833
But I'm afraid I'm going to hurt
someone. I feel like I have to be stopped.

23:58.909 --> 24:01.776
She can't be stopped.
She's a Cylon.

24:03.847 --> 24:06.008
You can't help her, Gaius.

24:07.684 --> 24:12.621
But you could probably sleep with
her. That's what you want, right?

24:16.126 --> 24:17.718
I'm not sure why...

24:24.434 --> 24:25.924
Sometimes...

24:27.971 --> 24:32.135
we must embrace
that which opens up for us.

24:35.445 --> 24:37.072
Embrace?

24:41.118 --> 24:43.086
Life can be a curse...

24:44.087 --> 24:46.021
as well as a blessing.

24:51.595 --> 24:54.359
You will believe me
when I tell you...

24:55.332 --> 25:00.167
there are far worse things
than death in this world.

25:01.538 --> 25:03.972
So you're saying...
No.

25:07.311 --> 25:11.213
What I say is meaningless.

25:14.084 --> 25:15.984
Listen to your heart.

25:17.321 --> 25:21.382
Embrace that which you know
to be the right decision.

26:08.938 --> 26:11.736
You might be right.
This may be Kobol.

26:13.309 --> 26:17.473
We should seriously consider
permanent settlement on this planet.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.446
The scriptures tell us that
Kobol points the way to Earth.

26:22.651 --> 26:25.848
Organize a ground survey team.
Three Raptors.

26:26.522 --> 26:29.184
I want a complete survey
of the ruins immediately.

26:29.291 --> 26:30.690
Yes, sir.

26:30.793 --> 26:32.454
You should go.

26:34.263 --> 26:38.529
Remember what I said, Gaius? You
don't want to be here when it happens.

26:38.634 --> 26:41.535
When what happens?
What would happen if I go?

26:42.805 --> 26:46.172
In fact, I think I'm going to
volunteer for the survey party.

26:46.242 --> 26:49.370
Your presence won't be
necessary, Doctor. Thank you.

26:49.478 --> 26:52.538
I'm the Vice President of the
colonies, elected in my own right.

26:52.648 --> 26:56.084
And I feel that my presence on the
planet will be necessary, Commander.

26:56.185 --> 26:59.416
As your chief science advisor, I'm
expected to analyze all the samples...

26:59.488 --> 27:01.820
the team bring back, and it
would be more efficient...

27:01.891 --> 27:03.722
if I can gather the samples
by myself.

27:03.826 --> 27:06.818
Unless you have any objection,
Madam President.

27:06.896 --> 27:08.989
No objections. Thank you.

27:09.832 --> 27:11.493
We need to talk.

27:12.768 --> 27:13.928
Sure.

27:26.115 --> 27:27.446
You okay?

27:34.123 --> 27:35.920
What do you think?

27:40.162 --> 27:43.928
I think it's hard to imagine that
you forgot to check the chamber.

27:49.772 --> 27:51.433
I didn't forget.

27:58.981 --> 28:02.280
Sharon, what's going on?

28:03.552 --> 28:05.884
I know things haven't been
so great lately, but...

28:05.988 --> 28:08.183
I wake up in the morning...

28:08.457 --> 28:10.448
and I wonder who I am.

28:13.996 --> 28:17.363
I wake up and wonder
if I'm going to hurt someone.

28:19.201 --> 28:21.192
Sharon, you need help.

28:23.372 --> 28:24.999
Not from you.

28:26.075 --> 28:28.043
You made that clear.

28:30.179 --> 28:32.647
I'm on my own.
No, you're not.

28:35.985 --> 28:38.249
Thanks for coming out, Chief.

28:39.755 --> 28:41.518
You're dismissed.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.403
So according
to the scriptures...

29:01.477 --> 29:04.503
if we had the arrow of Apollo,
we could take it down to Kobol,

29:04.580 --> 29:06.047
and we could use it...

29:06.115 --> 29:10.074
to open the tomb of Athena
and find our way to Earth.

29:13.756 --> 29:16.190
I didn't know
you were that religious.

29:16.325 --> 29:17.883
Neither did I.

29:18.661 --> 29:21.289
Something wrong with that?
No.

29:23.332 --> 29:24.959
It's just new.

29:29.872 --> 29:33.137
There is no Earth.
You understand that.

29:33.809 --> 29:36.277
It would seem that
we were wrong.

29:37.613 --> 29:40.514
Commander, just because you
and I don't know where it is...

29:40.616 --> 29:43.141
it doesn't mean
it doesn't exist.

29:45.821 --> 29:47.516
Madam President...

29:47.957 --> 29:51.893
I am not trying to mock your
faith, so please understand me.

29:52.294 --> 29:56.390
These stories about Kobol,
gods...

29:57.366 --> 29:59.391
the arrow of Apollo...

30:00.069 --> 30:03.129
they're just stories,
legends, myths.

30:05.241 --> 30:08.677
Don't let it blind you
to the reality that we face.

30:09.878 --> 30:14.406
Reality is that the Cylon Raider
has been successfully jump-tested.

30:15.117 --> 30:19.713
Reality is that Cylon technology
obviously outstrips our own.

30:20.089 --> 30:22.580
And reality is
there is a good chance...

30:22.691 --> 30:26.422
the Raider can jump all the way back
to Caprica and retrieve that arrow...

30:26.528 --> 30:29.019
and find our way to Earth.

30:29.398 --> 30:32.595
The real Earth.
The Raider's a military asset.

30:32.901 --> 30:36.200
I'm not gonna use it to go
chasing some mythical arrow.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.572
I'm sorry.

30:41.977 --> 30:43.376
<i>I say we find Kobol,</i>

30:43.445 --> 30:44.969
<i>count our blessings,
and just stay there.</i>

30:45.047 --> 30:46.537
<i>But the sacred scrolls tell us</i>

30:46.615 --> 30:48.640
<i>that this could
guide us to Earth. Right?</i>

30:49.251 --> 30:52.778
Okay. Cut the chatter.
Raptors 2 and 3 on me.

30:52.855 --> 30:54.720
FTL's spun up and ready?

30:54.790 --> 30:57.020
Cally, hold onto your lunch.

30:57.526 --> 30:59.551
Jump in ten...

31:00.095 --> 31:02.188
<i>nine, eight...</i>

31:02.798 --> 31:06.199
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

31:06.869 --> 31:09.133
<i>four, three...</i>

31:09.705 --> 31:11.696
two, one.

31:17.046 --> 31:18.707
Jump complete, gentlemen.

31:18.781 --> 31:22.273
Bring the nose down, we should
see the planet directly ahead.

31:22.384 --> 31:24.113
What the hell is that?

31:25.287 --> 31:26.652
Oh, my, gods!

31:34.196 --> 31:36.426
Get us out of here!

31:49.878 --> 31:52.676
We got a fire in the turbine.
Shutting it down!

31:54.950 --> 31:57.282
Pilot down!

31:57.519 --> 31:59.680
Out of the way! Come on!

32:01.290 --> 32:03.190
Get out of the seat, Doc!

32:08.997 --> 32:11.795
Everybody hang on!

32:12.134 --> 32:13.465
Can you jump us out?

32:13.569 --> 32:15.662
No, FTL drive's been hit.

32:15.804 --> 32:17.465
Socinus, get on the horn now...

32:17.573 --> 32:19.973
<i>and tell Raptor 2 to
jump back to Galactica!</i>

32:20.075 --> 32:21.133
Right now!

32:21.243 --> 32:24.644
<i>Jump back to Galactica!</i>

32:29.918 --> 32:31.852
<i>Jump back to Galactica, over.</i>

32:34.356 --> 32:37.086
<i>You are ordered to
jump back to Galactica.</i>

32:45.868 --> 32:48.393
Whenever they're within a certain
proximity of one another...

32:48.470 --> 32:50.665
they send off
a short IFF burst.

32:51.473 --> 32:53.464
Essentially,
they are Cylon transponders...

32:53.542 --> 32:56.875
programmed to identify themselves
to any other Cylon transponder.

32:57.012 --> 33:00.243
Damn nice work, Lieutenant.
That's very good.

33:01.417 --> 33:04.545
Now that we know what they are,
I want to test one in the Raider.

33:04.653 --> 33:06.245
Dradis contact.

33:06.355 --> 33:08.380
Raptor 275, sir.

33:08.490 --> 33:09.980
Back early.

33:13.028 --> 33:14.723
Something's wrong.

33:18.167 --> 33:19.600
What the hell are you doing?

33:20.769 --> 33:23.169
Oh, God! Hang on!

33:23.338 --> 33:25.067
God! Oh, my God!

33:30.012 --> 33:31.240
Do it!

33:31.346 --> 33:33.405
Everybody hit the deck!

33:42.090 --> 33:43.785
I can't see!

33:43.892 --> 33:46.622
Pull it up!

33:50.432 --> 33:51.626
Watch the hill!

33:51.733 --> 33:53.564
Thanks a lot, Chief!

33:58.907 --> 34:00.602
How many people did we lose?

34:00.675 --> 34:02.973
<i>Ten souls aboard Raptor 3.</i>

34:03.078 --> 34:05.478
<i>Raptor 1, last visual contact
was seen...</i>

34:05.580 --> 34:08.310
under power flight
heading toward the surface.

34:08.416 --> 34:12.182
We need a way to take out the base
ship before we can attempt a rescue.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.117
Starbuck's already working
on a plan...

34:14.189 --> 34:17.852
using the captured Raider to
get a nuke into the base ship.

34:19.694 --> 34:22.185
The Raider?
When did this happen?

34:22.530 --> 34:23.861
About 10 minutes ago.

34:23.932 --> 34:27.800
She said she's working on the details
and we'll have a report at 1400.

34:28.036 --> 34:30.971
Go talk to Starbuck
right away. My pleasure.

34:31.039 --> 34:32.768
And report back to me.
Yes, sir.

34:32.841 --> 34:35.401
Is there something I should be
worried about, Madam President?

34:35.477 --> 34:36.637
Why do you ask that?

34:36.711 --> 34:39.202
That look on your face.
Not now.

34:39.714 --> 34:42.877
Take that out. I know the Chief
said we need it, but I don't.

34:42.984 --> 34:45.316
Lt. Thrace, attention!

34:46.388 --> 34:50.484
I gave you a command.
You will obey it. Attention!

34:54.596 --> 34:58.726
You do not take your
harebrained ideas to the XO...

34:58.800 --> 35:02.099
without going through me
first. Do you understand?

35:04.239 --> 35:05.604
Yes, sir.

35:12.247 --> 35:15.216
At ease. So what's the plan?

35:16.885 --> 35:21.083
I'm putting an autopilot in the
Raider. Jump him to the base ship.

35:21.389 --> 35:25.257
Engage the autopilot, punch
out. Get picked up by a Raptor.

35:25.326 --> 35:26.918
The Raider heads
to the base ship.

35:26.995 --> 35:30.055
Picks up the transponder,
allows the Raider to approach.

35:30.598 --> 35:32.156
Nuke goes off.

35:33.268 --> 35:34.599
Boom, sir.

35:34.969 --> 35:37.836
Might work.
Might get you killed.

35:39.307 --> 35:41.332
Would you miss me, sir?

35:43.211 --> 35:45.372
I need every pilot I have.

35:46.281 --> 35:48.112
Even the screw-ups.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.717
Captain.

35:58.226 --> 35:59.989
I'm really sorry.

36:07.535 --> 36:11.301
If you do this, it could threaten
everything that we've accomplished.

36:11.473 --> 36:14.567
It may bring down the government
and you don't have a right...

36:14.676 --> 36:16.576
to risk that for a...

36:18.580 --> 36:19.740
Go on.

36:20.515 --> 36:23.177
For a drug-induced
vision of prophecy.

36:23.518 --> 36:25.577
I am well aware of that.

36:26.754 --> 36:30.212
But it would seem that the
gods have a different plan.

36:30.625 --> 36:33.526
Would you please
get me Lt. Thrace?

36:36.197 --> 36:37.960
Can I get you some more water?

36:38.099 --> 36:40.260
Yes. Thanks.

36:46.441 --> 36:47.931
You can't be serious.

36:48.042 --> 36:51.409
All of this has happened
before and will happen again.

36:51.546 --> 36:54.947
That Cylon you interrogated,
he quoted that bit of scripture.

36:55.049 --> 36:57.609
He also said that
we would find Kobol...

36:57.719 --> 37:00.745
and Kobol would show us
the way, did he not?

37:01.422 --> 37:02.650
Yes, he did.

37:02.757 --> 37:04.588
We have found Kobol.

37:05.693 --> 37:08.457
Do you believe in the gods,
Lieutenant?

37:11.166 --> 37:15.330
Not that it's any of your
business, but, yes, I believe.

37:15.503 --> 37:19.667
Lieutenant, I am not trying to
put you on the defensive, I just...

37:20.275 --> 37:23.506
I would like you
to think this through with me.

37:24.112 --> 37:26.342
If you believe in the gods...

37:26.648 --> 37:29.208
then you believe in
the cycle of time...

37:29.317 --> 37:32.309
that we are all playing
our parts in a story...

37:32.387 --> 37:36.687
that is told again and again
and again throughout eternity.

37:36.824 --> 37:38.348
That's the way I was raised.

37:38.459 --> 37:40.791
But that doesn't mean
that my part in the story...

37:40.862 --> 37:44.491
is to go off on some crazy-ass
mission against orders.

37:47.235 --> 37:51.797
May I tell you the part of the story
that it would seem I am playing?

37:54.676 --> 37:56.109
I am dying.

37:56.911 --> 38:00.210
What?
I have terminal breast cancer.

38:00.281 --> 38:02.579
I have six months at
the outside to live,

38:02.650 --> 38:04.447
and I have only told
three people...

38:04.519 --> 38:07.784
so I'd appreciate it
if you kept it to yourself.

38:08.122 --> 38:09.521
Of course.

38:10.058 --> 38:11.457
Are you saying that you are...

38:11.526 --> 38:14.552
The scripture tells us
a dying leader...

38:14.629 --> 38:17.291
led humanity to
the promised land.

38:19.234 --> 38:22.635
If you go back to Caprica
and bring me the arrow...

38:23.771 --> 38:25.762
I will show us the way.

38:28.409 --> 38:30.070
This is crazy.

38:30.144 --> 38:34.706
People keep using that word.
It is crazy. Perhaps.

38:35.516 --> 38:38.178
That doesn't mean
it isn't true.

38:40.154 --> 38:42.588
And it may be our only chance.

38:43.491 --> 38:45.891
Our only chance...

38:46.294 --> 38:47.784
to find Earth.

38:47.929 --> 38:50.591
The old man is our last chance
to find Earth.

38:50.765 --> 38:54.064
He knows where it is.
He said so. You were there.

38:54.202 --> 38:58.002
The location is a secret. But
he is going to take us there.

39:09.851 --> 39:13.412
Commander Adama has no idea...

39:13.655 --> 39:16.351
where Earth is. He never did.

39:16.491 --> 39:20.325
He made it up
in order to give people hope.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.062
You're lying.
Go ask him.

39:28.936 --> 39:30.335
I will.

39:41.316 --> 39:43.079
I need one more
in-flight test...

39:43.151 --> 39:46.587
for the autopilot and NAV
systems before I jump for Kobol.

39:46.721 --> 39:47.983
Right.

39:50.158 --> 39:52.558
Can I ask you a question,
boss?

39:52.827 --> 39:54.158
Shoot.

39:56.731 --> 39:59.393
How much longer till
we reach Earth?

40:02.770 --> 40:04.499
It's hard to say.

40:06.107 --> 40:07.836
You got a guess?

40:10.478 --> 40:12.844
You know I don't like
to guess.

40:15.450 --> 40:17.350
Are we getting closer?

40:20.955 --> 40:22.684
I'm sure we are.

40:23.358 --> 40:25.349
Good luck on the next test.

40:41.342 --> 40:43.970
Apollo. Starbuck.
I'm ready over here.

40:50.818 --> 40:53.013
Okay, Starbuck.
The board is green.

40:56.491 --> 40:57.822
Copy that.

40:58.693 --> 41:01.184
Powering up
for the autopilot test.

41:06.501 --> 41:09.766
<i>This is Starbuck, request permission
to speak with Galactica actual.</i>

41:11.072 --> 41:13.438
Starbuck wants
to speak to you, sir.

41:13.574 --> 41:16.042
She's on a scrambled channel.

41:23.885 --> 41:25.216
Go ahead.

41:27.388 --> 41:31.154
I believed you.
Believed in Earth.

41:32.059 --> 41:33.754
What are you doing, Starbuck?

41:34.762 --> 41:36.491
Bringing home the cat, sir.

41:37.899 --> 41:39.890
We can talk about this.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.667
No, I don't think so.

41:44.005 --> 41:46.303
I want you to
remember one thing.

41:46.374 --> 41:48.774
I do not regret anything
that I did.

41:50.244 --> 41:55.011
Be sure that whatever you're going
to do, you don't regret it later.

41:55.383 --> 41:57.283
Do you understand me?

41:59.620 --> 42:01.554
I guess we'll find out.

42:07.728 --> 42:10.891
Commander, she's spinning up
the Raider's FTL drive.

42:10.965 --> 42:12.364
What?

42:12.800 --> 42:15.564
This is an autopilot test,
what the hell is she doing?

42:15.670 --> 42:17.399
What are you doing, Kara?

42:23.144 --> 42:25.271
<i>Galactica. Apollo.
She just jumped away.</i>

42:25.346 --> 42:26.370
Repeat.

42:26.447 --> 42:29.143
<i>Starbuck and the
Raider just jumped away.</i>

42:32.920 --> 42:37.220
She wasn't scheduled for a jump
test. Where the hell did she go?

42:41.462 --> 42:42.827
Home.
