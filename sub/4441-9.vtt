00:12.102 --> 00:15.004
Where's your ex?

00:15.072 --> 00:16.672
She's been out sick all week.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.841
Oh... oh, I get it.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.409
(Chuckles)

00:20.477 --> 00:22.044
She's all embarrassed
to show her face now

00:22.112 --> 00:24.413
'cause you tapped it
and scrapped it, right?

00:24.481 --> 00:26.148
You down with O.P.P.?

00:26.216 --> 00:27.483
Wilfred:
Sorry, sorry...

00:27.551 --> 00:29.552
Sorry I'm late, everyone.
Sorry.

00:29.619 --> 00:30.953
Jen. Hair looks great today.

00:31.021 --> 00:31.872
Whoa...

00:32.072 --> 00:33.639
Scotty boy!

00:33.707 --> 00:35.007
Did you see <i>the bachelorette</i>
last night?

00:35.075 --> 00:36.008
Brutal.

00:36.076 --> 00:37.076
(Laughing)

00:37.143 --> 00:38.244
Jeremy:
Okay.

00:38.311 --> 00:40.646
Listen up.

00:40.714 --> 00:42.414
This morning, Kanner-McKay
announced the results

00:42.482 --> 00:46.252
of their phase three trials
of their cancer drug...

00:46.319 --> 00:48.420
Ahead of schedule, and, uh...

00:48.422 --> 00:50.889
Well, what can I say?

00:50.957 --> 00:52.157
We lost.

00:52.225 --> 00:53.993
(All sighing)

00:54.060 --> 00:55.194
They beat us.

00:55.262 --> 00:57.796
All of our investors have, uh...

00:57.864 --> 00:59.131
Jumped ship.

00:59.199 --> 01:01.734
What?
Oh, no, no..

01:01.801 --> 01:03.035
(Murmuring) We're screwed.

01:03.103 --> 01:05.704
Me, speaking,
you, quieting down.

01:05.772 --> 01:07.006
Go.

01:07.073 --> 01:09.208
(Slurping)

01:09.276 --> 01:12.811
Ah...

01:12.879 --> 01:14.079
Now, I know that you're all
worried about your jobs.

01:14.147 --> 01:16.048
And I understand that.

01:16.116 --> 01:17.283
But my grandfather

01:17.350 --> 01:20.052
was once trapped

01:20.120 --> 01:21.920
inside a mine

01:21.988 --> 01:23.656
for 15 days.

01:25.258 --> 01:26.925
And everyone around him

01:26.993 --> 01:29.628
had lost hope.

01:29.696 --> 01:30.929
But not my pepaw.

01:32.097 --> 01:33.631
He looked at those men,

01:33.699 --> 01:35.967
and he said,

01:36.034 --> 01:38.202
"us.

01:38.270 --> 01:40.872
"Digging out of here.

01:40.939 --> 01:42.440
Go."

01:43.243 --> 01:44.543
And ten years later,

01:44.611 --> 01:46.879
he owned that mine!

01:46.946 --> 01:48.380
(Murmuring)

01:48.448 --> 01:49.915
And my grandfather

01:49.983 --> 01:52.451
never gave up hope,
and neither should you.

01:52.519 --> 01:54.153
You should refuse

01:54.220 --> 01:55.988
to see this situation
as a defeat...

01:56.055 --> 01:58.357
But rather

01:58.425 --> 01:59.858
as an opportunity

01:59.926 --> 02:02.795
to do something even better,
even bigger!

02:02.862 --> 02:05.330
(Excited murmurs)
Because this I know:

02:05.398 --> 02:09.801
You will dig yourselves
out of this mine,

02:09.869 --> 02:12.171
and you will emerge
even stronger,

02:12.238 --> 02:16.608
and you will change the world!

02:16.676 --> 02:18.177
(Cheering)

02:18.244 --> 02:19.711
Baby!

02:19.779 --> 02:22.214
(Whooping)
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:22.282 --> 02:25.551
I need to call the wife.

02:25.618 --> 02:27.019
(Laughing)

02:27.086 --> 02:28.787
Aw, man!

02:28.855 --> 02:31.156
That was some
inspirational shit!

02:31.224 --> 02:34.092
First I'm like, "I cannot afford
to lose this job right now,"

02:34.160 --> 02:36.228
but it's just like Jeremy said,
you know? We gotta...

02:36.296 --> 02:38.030
(Gunshot)

02:38.097 --> 02:40.332
(Radio chatter)

02:41.668 --> 02:43.168
Man.

02:43.236 --> 02:44.770
When someone shoots
themselves in the face,

02:44.838 --> 02:48.273
it's just like... <i>Dude.</i>

02:48.341 --> 02:50.042
I don't want to cast
a darker shadow

02:50.109 --> 02:51.844
on an already tragic day,

02:51.911 --> 02:55.314
but I think someone may have
eaten part of Jeremy's brains.

03:01.988 --> 03:05.457
(Water bubbling)

03:05.525 --> 03:07.793
(Ringtone playing)

03:10.263 --> 03:12.531
(Sighs)

03:13.700 --> 03:16.034
Hey, kristen.

03:16.102 --> 03:17.669
Uh, thanks for ignoring
my calls all morning.

03:17.737 --> 03:19.037
Where have you been?

03:19.105 --> 03:21.507
Oh. Right.
Your checkup thing.

03:21.574 --> 03:23.242
That's right, Ryan,
my checkup thing.

03:23.309 --> 03:25.544
For my pregnancy thing, which
you are now 30 minutes late for.

03:25.612 --> 03:27.579
You said you'd be here, Ryan.
People in the waiting room

03:27.647 --> 03:29.715
were looking at me
like I was a slut.

03:29.782 --> 03:32.684
It's just... I'm not in
a good place right now.

03:32.752 --> 03:34.319
Everything went to shit
two weeks ago, and...

03:34.387 --> 03:35.687
That's right, Ryan.

03:35.755 --> 03:37.256
That was two whole weeks.
Move on.

03:37.323 --> 03:39.124
Scott, that is not
my vagina! Look,

03:39.192 --> 03:40.325
I need you to be here for me.

03:40.393 --> 03:41.493
I do not want to be all alone

03:41.561 --> 03:43.262
in that delivery room.

03:43.329 --> 03:44.963
Can't you just...
Ask someone else?

03:45.031 --> 03:46.164
Thanks for nothing, Ryan.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.368
Uh-oh.

03:49.435 --> 03:51.703
Jenna's out of town.

03:51.771 --> 03:54.740
Two single boys with no jobs
and nothing to do, whoo-hoo!

03:54.807 --> 03:57.509
Come on, let's get started.
I don't feel like going out.

03:57.577 --> 04:00.145
But you've been sitting on your
ass doing nothing all week.

04:00.213 --> 04:01.446
So?

04:01.514 --> 04:03.382
My life sucks right now.

04:03.449 --> 04:05.884
Look, I wish I could press
the reset button, but I can't.

04:05.952 --> 04:07.519
I'm just trying
to take care of myself.

04:07.587 --> 04:09.121
Yeah.

04:09.188 --> 04:10.789
And judging by the rigidity
of your load sock,

04:10.857 --> 04:12.624
you've been taking care
of yourself quite a bit.

04:12.692 --> 04:14.593
What do you want?
Look...

04:14.661 --> 04:16.661
You're depressed.
I get it.

04:16.728 --> 04:18.564
You know what I do
when I'm feeling down?

04:18.630 --> 04:21.266
I get outside myself and
do some good in the world.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.669
(Scoffs) Yeah, right. I do.

04:23.736 --> 04:25.938
Remember when I mauled that black
teenager's face the other day?

04:26.005 --> 04:28.173
You think I did that because
he had ice cream on his cheek?

04:28.241 --> 04:29.942
No. I did it because

04:30.009 --> 04:32.077
I hoped it would help him
go on to be the next seal.

04:32.145 --> 04:34.613
Wait, you did what?
It's called service, Ryan.

04:34.681 --> 04:36.348
And you can start by
making me breakfast.

04:36.416 --> 04:38.517
I usually eat at 9:15 sharp,

04:38.585 --> 04:40.786
and it's already
approaching... 9:17!

04:40.853 --> 04:42.321
Come on, I'm kind of
freaking out here.

04:42.388 --> 04:44.656
(Phone chirps)

04:49.195 --> 04:51.330
(Sighs)

04:51.397 --> 04:54.399
This is why we had
to rush over here... her cat?

04:56.569 --> 05:00.138
I appreciate you both
coming on such short notice.

05:00.206 --> 05:02.207
There, there, mum.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.343
Oh, wilfred.

05:06.779 --> 05:09.881
Uh, okay, the thing is...
and it's not a big deal...

05:09.949 --> 05:12.784
it's just, I like
to have my paw on top.

05:15.388 --> 05:17.556
I know how much
mittens meant to you.

05:17.624 --> 05:20.158
She was my best friend.

05:20.226 --> 05:23.295
Okay, uh, maybe you didn't
hear me the first time.

05:23.363 --> 05:25.263
And again, it's not
a big deal, uh, but...

05:25.331 --> 05:27.265
I usually have my paw on top.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.868
Don't know how I can be
any more clear about that.

05:29.936 --> 05:31.637
(Sobs quietly)

05:31.704 --> 05:34.072
As you can see,
I'm kind of a mess right now.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.108
Look, I...

05:36.175 --> 05:39.544
Be cool, wilfred.
She's grieving.

05:39.612 --> 05:41.613
Sorry for your loss.

05:41.681 --> 05:44.416
Thank you, sweetheart.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.284
You are just glowing

05:46.352 --> 05:48.553
with the spirit of motherhood.

05:48.621 --> 05:50.422
Thanks.

05:50.490 --> 05:52.991
So is the baby a mulatto?

05:53.059 --> 05:55.293
What? No, mom.

05:55.361 --> 05:58.430
So you're no longer
exclusively into black love?

05:58.498 --> 06:00.565
Is that what
you're trying to tell me?

06:00.633 --> 06:02.000
You know what?

06:02.068 --> 06:03.902
Uh, kristen could
really use some help

06:03.970 --> 06:06.104
preparing for the baby.
Ryan.

06:06.172 --> 06:08.907
Ryan: I mean, that's what I
do when I'm feeling down.

06:08.975 --> 06:11.543
I get outside myself and
do some good in the world.

06:11.611 --> 06:13.779
Hey, you stole my line.

06:13.846 --> 06:16.448
You know what I say to people
when they steal my lines?

06:16.516 --> 06:18.250
I say, "hey, hey, hey",

06:18.317 --> 06:20.585
it's fat Albert."

06:22.488 --> 06:24.489
Kristen,

06:24.557 --> 06:28.026
I-I would love to help you
with your baby.

06:29.462 --> 06:31.363
I delivered mitten's kittens.

06:31.431 --> 06:33.298
Most of them lived.

06:33.366 --> 06:36.468
It would be so wonderful
to be there for you.

06:36.536 --> 06:39.271
Um, well...

06:39.338 --> 06:42.007
I could use all the help
I can get.

06:46.479 --> 06:47.612
Watch the baby.

06:50.550 --> 06:52.050
It's a terrible idea.

06:52.118 --> 06:54.252
I wouldn't recommend her
leaving the grounds.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.520
In fact, I think
we should discuss

06:55.588 --> 06:57.522
a more managed care situation.

06:57.590 --> 06:59.124
But I thought she
was getting better.

06:59.192 --> 07:01.226
Well, some people take
a turn for the worse,

07:01.294 --> 07:03.028
especially after losing
someone close to them.

07:03.096 --> 07:04.763
Even if it was a cat.

07:04.831 --> 07:07.466
Mom's gonna be crushed.

07:07.533 --> 07:10.302
Look, she's been
very resistant to this idea.

07:10.369 --> 07:12.337
It would really help
ease the transition

07:12.405 --> 07:14.272
if one of you
could convince her

07:14.340 --> 07:16.374
that this is
in her best interest.

07:19.679 --> 07:21.546
(Scoffs)

07:23.449 --> 07:25.050
I know this is difficult.

07:25.118 --> 07:27.185
And if you need to talk
to someone,

07:27.253 --> 07:29.321
here's the number
of a good therapist.

07:29.388 --> 07:31.156
He really helped me
through a tough time

07:31.224 --> 07:32.891
after I was...

07:32.959 --> 07:35.026
Raped.

07:35.094 --> 07:36.561
(Laughs)

07:39.232 --> 07:41.099
Hmm.

07:43.035 --> 07:44.936
Shall I show you
our managed care facility?

07:45.004 --> 07:46.705
Wilfred:
Ryan, I know the timing

07:46.773 --> 07:48.206
couldn't possibly be any worse,

07:48.274 --> 07:49.775
but I think someone may have

07:49.842 --> 07:52.444
dug up mittens and eaten
part of the corpse.

07:52.512 --> 07:54.112
(Inhales sharply)

07:54.180 --> 07:55.680
Kristen:
Come on, Ryan.

07:55.748 --> 07:56.782
Catherine:
<i>Did Dr. Cahill</i>

07:56.849 --> 07:59.284
talk to you about that...

07:59.352 --> 08:01.553
Managed care thing?

08:01.621 --> 08:03.822
Yeah.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.825
Well, what do you think?
Do you think I'm that crazy?

08:06.893 --> 08:08.860
Of course not.

08:08.928 --> 08:12.430
But he is the doctor, right?

08:15.067 --> 08:16.735
Do you remember that?

08:16.803 --> 08:19.237
When I used to help you paint?

08:19.305 --> 08:20.372
Yeah.

08:20.439 --> 08:21.540
(Both laugh)

08:21.607 --> 08:23.408
You were so talented.

08:23.476 --> 08:26.144
You had such a gift
that I gave you.

08:26.212 --> 08:28.780
And now you kids
are all grown up

08:28.848 --> 08:30.682
and you don't need me any more.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.684
Of course, when you did need me,

08:33.753 --> 08:36.520
I really wasn't there.

08:36.589 --> 08:38.957
I will always regret that.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.525
But...

08:40.592 --> 08:42.928
Taking care of mittens,

08:42.995 --> 08:44.963
that...

08:45.031 --> 08:47.966
Made me feel useful.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.734
And now that she's dead...

08:53.606 --> 08:54.973
Sometimes when

08:55.041 --> 08:56.641
your father was

08:56.709 --> 08:58.910
yelling at me about,

08:58.978 --> 09:02.080
I don't know,
spoons or whatever,

09:02.148 --> 09:04.516
I had this fantasy

09:04.584 --> 09:06.751
of just escaping

09:06.819 --> 09:08.653
and running away from it all.

09:08.721 --> 09:11.723
Like, actually running away.

09:11.791 --> 09:13.658
Just doing something for me.

09:13.726 --> 09:16.127
I've had thoughts like that.

09:16.195 --> 09:18.597
Leaving everything behind.

09:18.664 --> 09:20.365
All the pain, the bad memories.

09:20.433 --> 09:21.933
Yeah.

09:22.001 --> 09:23.869
Just hitting the road,

09:23.936 --> 09:26.104
popping in a bitching-ass
mix tape,

09:26.172 --> 09:28.139
and just being...

09:28.207 --> 09:30.041
Free.
Free.

09:30.109 --> 09:31.309
Have you lost
your mind? Mexico?

09:31.377 --> 09:32.677
You know they eat
dogs down there.

09:32.745 --> 09:34.579
They do not.

09:34.647 --> 09:36.748
What, you don't think
Mexico city has a Koreatown?

09:36.816 --> 09:38.950
Get in. I'm a creature
of habit, Ryan.

09:39.018 --> 09:40.986
I eat, sleep, and shit
on a very rigid schedule.

09:41.053 --> 09:43.588
You can't just take me out of my
routine. I'm not, I'm not going.

09:43.656 --> 09:44.656
(Sighs)

09:44.724 --> 09:47.192
Fine. <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

09:47.260 --> 09:48.827
Bullshit.

09:48.895 --> 09:51.229
We both know you're not
just gonna leave me here.

09:51.297 --> 09:54.232
All talk, just as I suspected.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.867
Now here's what's gonna happen.

09:55.935 --> 09:58.203
We're gonna ditch mom,
pick up some primo,

09:58.271 --> 09:59.638
head back to your place...

10:01.274 --> 10:03.541
Goddamn you, Ryan.
Shotgun.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.444
Catherine:
Whoo!

10:13.512 --> 10:15.546
We're free!

10:15.614 --> 10:18.383
Celebrate through
dance with me, Ryan.

10:18.450 --> 10:19.717
Wilfred:
This is torture.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.052
Long car rides
are animal cruelty.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.754
(Laughs) (Laughs)

10:22.821 --> 10:25.023
Don't think I can be distracted
with all this fun wind.

10:25.090 --> 10:28.226
Yeah! Wind!

10:28.294 --> 10:31.396
Apparently someone doesn't know
the rules of shotgun.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.965
Do you think wilfred's
safe back there?

10:34.033 --> 10:36.167
Wilfred, sit down. I don't need to sit.
Anyone who knows

10:36.235 --> 10:37.835
anything about dogs knows
that we have perfect balance.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.137
In fact,

10:39.204 --> 10:40.738
there is no physical force
that can even...

10:40.806 --> 10:41.539
(Tires squeal) (Grunts)

10:41.607 --> 10:42.774
Ooh, ooh, oh,

10:42.841 --> 10:44.242
there's an organic fruit stand

10:44.310 --> 10:45.910
up ahead that's built
on what I believe to be

10:45.978 --> 10:48.079
a vortex energy field.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.281
Do you mind if we stop there?

10:50.349 --> 10:53.151
Hey, it's not like we've
got anywhere to be.

10:53.218 --> 10:55.219
Wilfred: Oh, hilarious.
I have my regular

10:55.287 --> 10:57.255
sun spot nap at 1:30.
I need to be there

10:57.323 --> 10:58.723
a few minutes early
for pre-nap stretching

10:58.791 --> 11:01.159
and my yawn-squeaks.

11:01.226 --> 11:02.393
This reminds me

11:02.461 --> 11:04.562
of those road trips
we used to take.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.831
Hey, do you remember that time
we drove to lake Tahoe,

11:06.899 --> 11:07.765
and kristen wouldn't speak

11:07.833 --> 11:09.801
to me for two days

11:09.868 --> 11:11.569
because I said
she could be president

11:11.637 --> 11:13.004
of the itty bitty
titty committee?

11:13.072 --> 11:14.806
(Both chuckle)

11:14.873 --> 11:17.642
The kids were
so cute back then.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.277
The kids?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.846
Oh. Uh! Brain toot!
(Blows raspberry)

11:21.914 --> 11:25.383
I meant you and your sister.
(Chuckles)

11:25.451 --> 11:27.685
Ryan, turn this car around now!
Calm down, wilfred!

11:27.753 --> 11:30.221
Don't tell me to calm down!
It's your fault that I'm...

11:30.289 --> 11:31.923
(Tires squeal) Aah!

11:31.991 --> 11:34.892
The energy vortex is
strong here, Ryan.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.061
I have not experienced

11:37.129 --> 11:40.064
geomagnetic rejuvenation
like this since...

11:40.132 --> 11:41.399
I don't know when.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.435
Look at my mom.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.771
She's never been so happy. You really
think you're helping her, Ryan?

11:46.839 --> 11:49.574
Shouldn't your wife
be in managed care?

11:49.641 --> 11:51.009
Whoops! Brain toot!

11:51.076 --> 11:52.977
(Blows raspberry)
I meant your mother.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.580
So she misspoke.
It was nothing.

11:55.647 --> 11:59.083
We got to go back, mate.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.451
No.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.120
All right.

12:02.187 --> 12:04.956
But don't pretend
you're doing this for her.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.991
(Ringtone plays)

12:10.462 --> 12:11.729
Hello.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.364
Kristen:
Where the hell have u been?!

12:13.432 --> 12:15.633
I'm just on a little road trip
with mom.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.268
A little road trip?

12:17.336 --> 12:19.237
You disappeared with our
mentally unstable mother!

12:19.304 --> 12:24.042
She's not mentally unstable.
She's just... eccentric.

12:24.109 --> 12:26.711
Well, imagine how "eccentric"
mom's gonna get

12:26.779 --> 12:28.513
if she doesn't take
her mood stabilizers.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.281
I'll make sure
she takes her meds.

12:30.349 --> 12:31.282
Hang on.

12:37.222 --> 12:39.924
Is that kitty litter?

12:39.992 --> 12:42.360
There's still
turds in it! Dibs!

12:42.428 --> 12:44.062
What the hell, dude?
I called dibs.

12:44.129 --> 12:45.663
She-she doesn't have her
medication with her.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.932
Of course not!
They dispense them here

12:48.000 --> 12:50.568
because... oh, that's right,
she's mentally unstable.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.737
I'll call you back.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.873
Hey, hey, mind if I drive?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.308
Uh... Come on! Get in the car!

12:57.376 --> 12:59.444
If we make it
to Victorville by sundown,

12:59.511 --> 13:02.146
I know a place
that rents stilts... cheap.

13:02.214 --> 13:03.915
(Plays "shave and a haircut")

13:03.982 --> 13:06.851
(Humming)

13:06.919 --> 13:10.354
Uh, listen,
I just talked to kristen,

13:10.422 --> 13:12.423
and she seems pretty worried.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.258
We've had a fun day, right?

13:14.326 --> 13:16.394
Maybe we should just head back.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.362
About time!

13:18.430 --> 13:20.665
Very funny, Ryan.

13:20.732 --> 13:25.002
Oh! Oh... you know where
we should stay tonight?

13:25.070 --> 13:27.905
I know the the most charming
little nudist hostel

13:27.973 --> 13:29.674
just outside Rosarito.

13:29.741 --> 13:30.908
That's it!

13:30.976 --> 13:31.909
I can't take it any more!

13:31.977 --> 13:32.977
Turn this bloody car around!

13:33.045 --> 13:33.978
It's bad enough

13:34.046 --> 13:35.780
mum is losing her mind,

13:35.848 --> 13:37.982
but now little Emily down
the street will go outside

13:38.050 --> 13:40.451
to play at 3:35 and not get
tail-whipped in the face!

13:40.519 --> 13:42.186
Is that what you want,
you sick bastard?!

13:42.254 --> 13:43.321
(Siren wails)

13:43.388 --> 13:44.355
Ah...
Shit.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.424
Thank God!

13:46.492 --> 13:47.458
(Sighs)

13:47.526 --> 13:48.960
Okay, Ryan, be cool.

13:49.027 --> 13:51.229
Just hide the bag of apples
under the seat.

13:51.296 --> 13:54.499
Why? Wait. Did you steal
this fruit?

13:54.566 --> 13:56.334
No, I did not steal the fruit.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.969
Fruit belongs to the
earth, and therefore,

13:58.036 --> 14:00.271
no human being has a right
to put a price on it.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.641
I did however steal this pen
from the cash register.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.343
Afternoon, officer.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.711
Wilfred:
Oh, thank God you're here.

14:06.778 --> 14:08.179
I'm being held hostage.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.480
My name is wilfred
Fazio Mueller,

14:09.548 --> 14:10.815
I live at 2200 ingmar drive...

14:10.883 --> 14:12.116
Cute dog.
Thank you.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.252
License and registration.

14:14.319 --> 14:16.687
Oh, gee, officer,

14:16.755 --> 14:18.789
I left my license at home...

14:18.857 --> 14:21.425
When I left there 20 years ago.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.294
Would you step out of the car,
ma'am?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.529
Ooh...

14:24.596 --> 14:27.598
Of course, officer.
No problem.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.433
Mom, what are you doing?!

14:29.501 --> 14:31.836
(Metal crunching)

14:31.904 --> 14:33.237
Mom!

14:33.305 --> 14:36.707
Victorville stilt shop or bust!

14:36.775 --> 14:38.109
Jesus, mom! Pull over!

14:38.177 --> 14:39.877
Why? This is exciting!

14:39.945 --> 14:43.781
I haven't been hassled
by the man since 1974.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.150
You just ran over
a cop's motorcycle!

14:46.218 --> 14:48.686
You're carrying around a purse
full of kitty litter!

14:48.754 --> 14:51.088
What, because I want
to keep a little piece

14:51.156 --> 14:53.191
of mittens with me,
that makes me crazy?

14:53.258 --> 14:54.792
What's crazy is
you not sharing.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.361
Just stop the car <i>now!</i>

14:57.429 --> 14:59.363
(Brakes squeak, Ryan sighs)

14:59.431 --> 15:01.999
Don't tell me
what to do, Henry.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.634
Henry?

15:03.702 --> 15:06.170
Mom, you know
I'm not dad, right?

15:10.042 --> 15:12.944
Yeah. Yeah, of
course I do.

15:13.011 --> 15:16.080
Mom... you're not well.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.583
Please... let me drive.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.952
Okay.

15:21.019 --> 15:22.453
(Sighs)

15:26.725 --> 15:29.594
You'll never control me, Henry!
Wait.

15:29.661 --> 15:31.395
Buckle up, sneakers! (Engine
revving, tires squealing)

15:31.463 --> 15:33.531
Mom! Wilfred: I'm not
sneakers, you crazy bitch.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.367
Henry, help!

15:36.435 --> 15:38.402
(Tires squealing, Ryan sighs)

15:42.368 --> 15:44.969
Kristen:
I appreciate that, officer.

15:45.037 --> 15:46.871
Like I said,
she's off of her medication.

15:46.939 --> 15:49.407
If you find her first,
will you please let us know?

15:49.475 --> 15:51.309
Thank you so much.
It's a good thing

15:51.377 --> 15:53.211
you're a lawyer,
'cause mom's gonna need one.

15:53.278 --> 15:55.079
I get it. I messed up.

15:55.147 --> 15:57.215
Don't you think
I feel terrible about this?

15:57.282 --> 15:59.117
You should,
because this is a disaster.

15:59.184 --> 16:02.153
Wait. Make a left up here.

16:02.221 --> 16:04.422
(High-pitched mewing
of kittens)

16:10.529 --> 16:12.463
You want to do this?

16:12.531 --> 16:14.432
I... (Scoffs) Wilfred:
You got to help me!

16:14.500 --> 16:17.468
My name is wilfred Fazio Mue...
Oh, it's you.

16:17.536 --> 16:19.037
Hey, mom?

16:19.104 --> 16:20.805
Mom, it's kristen.
I'm gonna...

16:20.873 --> 16:23.641
Hi. I'm gonna need you to
take your medication, okay?

16:23.709 --> 16:26.944
Right. I'm sorry,
but you have to.

16:27.012 --> 16:28.946
You're my helper, remember?

16:29.014 --> 16:30.148
I can't help you.

16:30.215 --> 16:31.849
Ah.
I can't even

16:31.917 --> 16:33.518
help myself.

16:33.585 --> 16:36.988
We should just come up with
some wacky way for me to die.

16:37.056 --> 16:38.890
Okay, here you go,
mom. Take this.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.825
Jesus, mom!

16:40.893 --> 16:42.894
Look, I can't deal
with this right now!

16:42.961 --> 16:45.096
Shut the damn cat up
and take your medicine.

16:45.164 --> 16:46.831
Ow! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:46.899 --> 16:48.032
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

16:48.100 --> 16:50.501
Do I look okay, Ryan?

16:50.569 --> 16:52.136
Oh, God, this is not happening!

16:52.204 --> 16:56.140
No, not now! Not in some
stupid hick's gross backyard!

16:56.208 --> 16:58.109
No offense!

16:58.177 --> 16:59.610
A towel or something?

16:59.678 --> 17:00.945
Shit, here comes the miracle!

17:01.013 --> 17:02.814
I'll-I'll
call 911!

17:02.881 --> 17:04.582
We're 50 Miles
from the nearest hospital, Ryan.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.517
You're gonna have
to help me through this, okay?

17:06.585 --> 17:08.152
(Sighs) Listen,

17:08.220 --> 17:09.720
I deliver babies for a living.

17:09.788 --> 17:11.789
You can do this,
but I need you to... ow!

17:11.857 --> 17:13.290
Did you not hear
what she said?!

17:13.358 --> 17:14.826
She needs your help, mate!

17:14.893 --> 17:16.394
I... I can't.
(Kristen panting)

17:16.462 --> 17:18.863
Ryan, I know you're depressed,

17:18.931 --> 17:21.799
and you don't want to think of
anyone but yourself right now,

17:21.867 --> 17:23.201
but that tainted whore
needs you.

17:23.268 --> 17:24.702
Ryan, please!

17:24.770 --> 17:26.369
For God's sake, go participate

17:26.438 --> 17:29.373
in the most beautiful experience
life has to offer,

17:29.441 --> 17:30.708
even if it means
looking directly

17:30.776 --> 17:32.276
into your own sister's
slop-hole.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.912
God! Oh!

17:34.980 --> 17:37.181
It's okay, kristen.

17:37.249 --> 17:39.083
(Sighs) I'm here.

17:39.151 --> 17:40.985
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:41.053 --> 17:43.988
Here, squeeze my hand, okay?
(Gasping)

17:44.056 --> 17:47.825
You're doing good, mittens.

17:47.893 --> 17:49.527
(Kitten mewing)

17:56.168 --> 17:57.869
(Baby cooing)

17:57.936 --> 17:59.470
Hi.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.640
I'm Ryan.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.976
I'm your Uncle.

18:12.084 --> 18:14.318
Are you feeling better, mom?

18:17.723 --> 18:19.991
(Baby cooing)

18:22.261 --> 18:25.796
You know, kristen's gonna
really need your help.

18:25.864 --> 18:29.200
And I was thinking
that maybe the best way

18:29.268 --> 18:33.404
to do that is for you to go back
and get the help that you need.

18:35.474 --> 18:37.909
I know.

18:37.976 --> 18:40.411
(Baby cooing)

18:43.849 --> 18:46.184
Careful.

18:46.251 --> 18:49.153
(Cooing)

18:52.491 --> 18:54.725
I'm a grandma.

18:54.793 --> 18:56.327
(Laughs)

18:59.031 --> 19:00.932
Listen, I hate
to be a Debbie downer,

19:00.999 --> 19:02.934
especially in the midst
of all this joy,

19:03.001 --> 19:05.937
but I think someone may have
eaten kristen's placenta.

19:06.004 --> 19:08.906
(Sucks in through teeth)

19:08.974 --> 19:10.641
(Cooing)

19:16.200 --> 19:18.368
I won't be too long, I promise.
Take your time.

19:18.436 --> 19:20.670
I was able to get patches
from up the street

19:20.738 --> 19:22.639
to cover Emily's
3:45 face-whipping.

19:22.707 --> 19:25.809
And my 4:30 Jenna
cuddle's been pushed.

19:25.877 --> 19:28.511
But if I'm not back by 6:30 A.M.
to bark at that garbage truck,

19:28.579 --> 19:31.381
I don't even want
to think about it.

19:31.449 --> 19:34.751
Go.

19:38.155 --> 19:39.756
Hey, mom.

19:39.824 --> 19:41.524
Ryan? Hey!
Hey.

19:41.592 --> 19:43.927
Oh, I-I... I don't want
to get paint on you.

19:43.995 --> 19:45.662
Oh, it's okay.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.899
So, how's your new, uh...

19:48.966 --> 19:51.968
Your new situation?

19:52.036 --> 19:54.237
Things are good.

19:54.305 --> 19:57.874
I've got a lot of mileage
out of the cop story.

19:57.942 --> 20:00.977
Um, I made a few
new friends, and

20:01.045 --> 20:02.279
they do everything for me here.

20:02.346 --> 20:04.347
I don't have to lift a finger.

20:04.415 --> 20:08.285
You know, I... I haven't
painted since I was a kid.

20:10.187 --> 20:12.355
You had a great eye.

20:12.423 --> 20:14.524
I had a great teacher.

(soft whimper)

20:43.421 --> 20:45.655
(Whimpering)

20:50.828 --> 20:52.529
(Grunts)

20:52.596 --> 20:54.230
(Panting)

20:54.298 --> 20:56.766
Another hilary swank dream?

20:56.834 --> 20:59.569
She was wearing a g-string
in this one.

20:59.637 --> 21:02.038
(Panting)

21:02.106 --> 21:04.407
(Voice breaking):
Ryan, it was so real.
