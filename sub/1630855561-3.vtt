00:01.126 --> 00:03.128
Just wondering if you could
do something for me.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.337
It depends on what it is.

00:04.337 --> 00:06.214

00:29.070 --> 00:31.072
I don't need you

means buying your own shit.

your ex a car,

01:20.872 --> 01:22.123
can you talk to me first?

01:22.123 --> 01:24.250
She asked for a car.
I got her one.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.502
- That's it.
- Okay, if it's that simple,

01:25.502 --> 01:26.753
I want a bigger place.

It's crazy
seeing this place all empty.

in this motherfucka.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.306
We went through a lot

You look like you goin'
to a meeting or something.

02:48.793 --> 02:52.255
No, I'm just
trying something new.

Well, you look nice.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.723
Thank you.

Mm-hmm.
I invited Malaysia.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.395
Oh, I ain't heard her name

04:30.395 --> 04:34.565
Yeah, after I had the baby,

over the phone

Fine.

Ain't no such thing
as "just a lookout."

to do more than that.

they gonna ask him
to hold something,

make more money off the top

to do it.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.482
What's up, little man?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.362
Nice car.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.616
Girl, please, you got a whole
house out of this nigga.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.037
Come here, EJ.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.876
What up?

10:40.765 --> 10:41.849
Hey.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.018
Ain't you that nigga from IG?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.478
Yeah, it's a lot of us.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.688
You Master Marshawn, right?

10:47.688 --> 10:49.273
The one and only.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.651
Yeah, man, I'd love
to get some of your advice,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.110
you know what I'm saying?
One-on-one.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.028
Oh, fo' sho'.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.405
The Cash App
is in the bio, bro.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.407
I'm kind of low on cash
right now, so...

10:58.407 --> 11:00.451
Damn, I'm kind of low
on advice.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.911
Nice meeting you, though.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.749
Hey, uh, it's kind of crowded
up in here, man.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.459
Look like the only seat...

11:08.459 --> 11:09.460
right here at the bar.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.920
May as well.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.301
You do the challenge?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.929
Shit, man, I was locked away
in the pen for 20 years.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.722
That shit was challenging
enough, you dig?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.224
Damn, I feel you.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.394
Hey, I did read your book, though.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.312
- Hmm.
- Yeah, <i>The Ten Ways to Level Up</i>

11:28.312 --> 11:30.606
<i>for a Real Queen
and How She Can Earn the Keys</i>

11:30.606 --> 11:32.942
<i>- to Your Kingdom.</i>
- Yeah, the title kind of long,

11:32.942 --> 11:34.819
- I know.
- That shit perfect, yo.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.530
Mm.
So you got a woman?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.948
Indeed, I do.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.991
She the breadwinner?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.411
Yeah, that's only
because it's kind of hard

11:43.411 --> 11:44.995
for me to get a gig right now.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.497
Hey, I ain't no bum nigga, though.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.040
Do you think
you gotta explain to me?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.542
You do not, my brother.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.626
You understand?
Look.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.878
We have been taking care
of women forever.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.464
These are reparations now.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.050
Huh, never thought of it
like that.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.927
Chapter nine, my nigga.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.638
I ain't made it that far yet.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.306
What your girl do?

12:04.306 --> 12:07.184
Oh, she's a art curator
for a art gallery downtown.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.352
Fancy.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.729
I know.
She real chill, though.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.646
She cool.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.523
She lets you smoke
in the house?

12:12.523 --> 12:14.650
Hell naw.
Gotta take that shit outside.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.902
Mm, that don't sound
chill to me.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.529
No, it don't.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.780
Damn, I gotta get out of here, man.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.615
Gotta go to nigga housewarming.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.242
Ah, shit, I'm going
to a housewarming too.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.493
Emmett's shit?

12:24.493 --> 12:25.745
Hell yeah, that's my nigga.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.621
I thought
he invited me on accident,

12:27.621 --> 12:29.540
but I'm still riding
through there, you know?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.751
Might be a couple baddies
in there for me.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.794
Shit, you wanna slide
through there together?

12:33.794 --> 12:34.962
You driving?

12:34.962 --> 12:37.173
I got my lady car and shit,
so you know.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.883
Good man, I like it.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.009
Let's go.
Come on.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.635
Think they gonna have
food there?

12:41.635 --> 12:42.887
Gonna have food?
If you wanna take a wing,

12:42.887 --> 12:44.013
- nigga, come on.
- Aw, shit, I can eat

12:44.013 --> 12:47.099
- in your girl car?
- Man, it's cool, come on.

12:50.644 --> 12:55.524
Mm, Kiesha need to package
this cheese dip and sell it.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.776
You ain't lying...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.652
and I don't even eat
dairy like that.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.531
I'm Deondray.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.700
I'm the one that sold
Emmett and Kiesha the house.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.869
Oh, hey.
I'm Emmett's mom, Jada.

13:06.869 --> 13:07.953
It's lovely to meet you.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.079
You're a realtor?

13:09.079 --> 13:10.623
- Yeah.
- Huh.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.957
Do I not look like one?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.794
I'm used to realtors
wearing suits and ties,

13:14.794 --> 13:15.920
flashing they cheesy smiles.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.423
I get it, but I swear
I do well for myself.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.716
A lot of my clients
look like me,

13:20.716 --> 13:22.802
and we speak the same language.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.553
I like that.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.056
I still wanna know
why you sold my son a house

13:27.056 --> 13:28.766
all the way over here
on the West Side.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.726
Come on.
The West Side is great,

13:30.726 --> 13:32.186
and I love living over here.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.021
It's a drive.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.856
It ain't that bad.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.775
I think it's important
we buy up real estate

13:37.775 --> 13:39.610
in our own neighborhoods.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.029
You should just want people
to buy real estate period.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.614
That's how you make your money.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.783
The money's nice,
but I'm a big believer

13:45.783 --> 13:48.661
in Black folks <i>owning</i>
their own homes.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.912
Buying a house
in a Black neighborhood

13:49.912 --> 13:51.705
isn't just an investment
for that family.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.499
It's a contribution
to the community.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.584
And when people
buy a house from me,

13:55.584 --> 13:57.461
they're not just investing
in me.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.339
They're investing into my
mission, my purpose, as well.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.550
Mm.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.551
Are you single?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.511
Naw.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.263
I'm off the market.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.430
Damn.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.104
It's an air fryer.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.898
Yeah, this baby has two baskets

14:17.898 --> 14:19.400
and dual temperature controls,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.569
so you can make two things
at the same time.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.028
- Thank y'all.
- Yeah.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.824
Oh, hell naw.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.784
Now, I know this nigga
did not just come in here

14:28.784 --> 14:30.786
dressed in designer
head-to-toe,

14:30.786 --> 14:31.912
and he still owes me money.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.706
- Let it go, Dre.
- Nah.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.875
I'll be right back.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.959
Hey, cuz.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.127
Hey, hey.
Hey, cuz.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.922
So...

14:41.922 --> 14:43.883
you still good with all this?

14:43.883 --> 14:47.177
Emmett or the house or what?

14:47.177 --> 14:49.847
Both.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.890
Yeah.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.434
I feel good about it.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.687
Well, just keep in mind,
you're raising kids now,

14:56.687 --> 14:59.148
three of which
aren't even yours.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.651
I know.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.988
And buying a house
is a big commitment,

15:05.988 --> 15:07.615
especially
when you're buying it

15:07.615 --> 15:11.327
with someone
you're not married to.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.620
I know.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.373
What if you two separate?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.876
Even Judge Judy won't hear you
if you're not married.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.128
I'm not going on <i>Judge Judy.</i>

15:21.128 --> 15:22.254
You say that now.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.255
Ma, please.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.299
I just want what's best
for you, Kiesha.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.009
I know.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.805
Okay.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.474
If you're happy, I'm happy.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.976
I'm happy.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.436
If you say so.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.450
Damn.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.952
Y'all good?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.752
I guess they don't
need me anymore.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.129
- Now, that's not true.
- Kevin just waved at me

16:04.129 --> 16:05.172
from across the room.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.633
Yeah, bae,
'cause he's with his friends.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.717
Kiesha bought this house

16:08.717 --> 16:10.678
without even
consulting me first.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.221
I can't believe she would do
something like that

16:12.221 --> 16:13.263
without even talking to me.

16:13.263 --> 16:18.185
Honey, your kids
are always gonna need you.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.896
They just gonna need you
in a different way.

16:20.896 --> 16:21.897
- Dre...
- You gotta learn

16:21.897 --> 16:24.108
- to accept that.
- Don't therapize me.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.318
Bae, I'm just trying
to tell you the truth.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.781
Well, I wish you wouldn't.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.825
Come on, now.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.077
Come dance with me.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.912
Don't be a Debbie Downer.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.539
Get yo' ass out there.
Come on.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.332
<i>...smell so good
when I bite that</i>

16:40.332 --> 16:42.042
<i>She a little feisty,

16:42.042 --> 16:44.003
<i>She do her thang

<i>Showin' out

16:45.796 --> 16:47.756
<i>In my ear like, "Girl,
what's your fantasy?"</i>

16:47.756 --> 16:50.175
<i>In her ear like,
"Girl, can you handle me?"</i>

16:51.552 --> 16:54.221
<i>Numb in the brain,
she thinking...</i>

16:54.221 --> 16:55.431
What?
I ain't had a home-cooked meal

16:55.431 --> 16:56.640
in a minute, a'ight?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.267
Then you need to learn
how to cook.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.102
I know how to cook.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.103
What can you cook?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.355
Uh, eggs... and bacon.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.191
So can
my seven-year-old sister.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.110
All right,
we not finna--

17:08.110 --> 17:09.695
why are you not eating?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.031
I went to Smokey's
with Jamal earlier.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.157
Oh, how'd that go?

17:13.157 --> 17:14.700
Good.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.160
He just keep bugging me
about Bakari.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.912
They are just alike,
so they'll probably get along.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.330
Jamal just think

17:20.330 --> 17:21.832
street niggas ain't shit.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.042
Mm, he would know.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.046
Jake almost popped Bakari's ass

17:27.046 --> 17:30.382
- over what happened.
- Then Bakari saved his life.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.760
Guess they even.

17:34.094 --> 17:37.139
<i>uneasy music</i>

17:42.019 --> 17:43.437

17:47.316 --> 17:48.358
Thanks for coming.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.569
Oh, my God.
I wouldn't miss it.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.821
What's this?
A bag of nickels?

17:52.821 --> 17:53.822
Naw.

17:53.822 --> 17:54.990
It's a little deadlier
than that.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.950
Okay.
Yeah, I'll put this in

17:56.950 --> 17:57.951
- with the rest of the gifts.
- No, no, I think

17:57.951 --> 17:59.161
you should open this privately.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.038
Okay, well, I'll just
get to it a little later--

18:01.038 --> 18:02.289
No, no.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.207
Open it now.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.291
All right,
I'll open it.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.502
- I mean, it's nice--
- Wait, just...

18:06.502 --> 18:08.045
not out here.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.838
Where are the drinks?
It's a party.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, there's drinks in here, yo.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.050

18:29.775 --> 18:31.318
You can't smoke that in here.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.904
Damn, Kiesha,
it's cold as fuck outside.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.322
I don't care.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.617
I'll smoke one with you.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.453
A'ight.

to hurt you, they may not
always come for you first.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.620
Who would wanna hurt my family?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.457
Who knows?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.752
- I don't like this.
- Yeah.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.880
I don't like it either, Emmett.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
But you know what?
It comes with the territory.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.634
I don't want it.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.763
Emmett, you can't just start
dressing like a boss.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.474
You have to start
acting like one too.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.979
Bosses got guns?

19:48.979 --> 19:51.315
I never leave home without it.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.237
<i>I set the tone
for the street life</i>

20:03.160 --> 20:05.704
I'm a boss...

20:05.704 --> 20:07.497

20:07.497 --> 20:09.291
Boss...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
I'm a fucking boss.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.253
Back up, boy.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.715
You come in my store?
You come in my store?

Nah, I mean, what you doing

20:52.334 --> 20:54.461

- Oh, I got lost.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.712
I was looking for the washroom.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.256
Oh, it's right here.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.340
- It's right here.
- Oh, okay.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.218
- Yeah, it's right there.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.417
We just sell his shit.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.294
Let me see what's to it.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.138

21:46.138 --> 21:48.265
Damn,

21:48.265 --> 21:49.599
A friend.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.436
A friend?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.438
So niggas keeping secrets now, huh?

21:56.315 --> 21:59.359
We all got our secrets, huh?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.032
Shit, I always keep it

22:05.032 --> 22:07.659
Until it come to my uncle.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.038
That's business, my nigga.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.415
It's family business to me, nigga.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.542
That nigga owe
a bunch of mo'fuckas money.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.252
Ain't no telling
who killed his ass.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.921
Yeah, but did he owe Douda?

22:22.132 --> 22:25.594
Last I heard,
he stole some money from Tracy,

22:25.594 --> 22:28.138
and Victor got real mad
about the shit.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.057
He had to take money
from nobody.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.559
Man, that nigga was
gambling all of his money away,

22:32.559 --> 22:35.103
doing all type
of crazy, weird shit.

22:35.103 --> 22:37.689
So you don't know nothing?

22:37.689 --> 22:38.899
No.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.256

<i>Know that you can pull

Stop being a little bitch.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.343
- Hey!
- Hey!

23:48.343 --> 23:49.636
Where did you hear that word?

23:49.636 --> 23:51.430
In Mom's car.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.563
Look, look, it's all right.
This ain't a big deal.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.440
- Yes, it is.
- No, listen.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.607
EJ just being a big brother,

24:02.607 --> 24:04.484
making sure he don't get punked
when he go to school.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.069
You ain't never have
no brothers.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.029
I know, and I got punked
every day, girl.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.156
That's how I became
a ladies' man.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.407
Emmett, if he's talking
like that at home,

24:10.407 --> 24:12.117
he's talking like that
at school.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.161
You need to talk to Tiff.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.370
Why you can't do it?

24:15.370 --> 24:16.746
Stuff just got
normal between us.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.707
That's gonna make it weird.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.667
And you want shit to be weird
between me and her?

24:20.667 --> 24:24.504
I can't tell her
how to raise y'all's son.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.715
All right, you right.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.841
You right.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.009
I got you.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.719
- It was funny, though.
- It was not funny.

24:30.719 --> 24:34.347
It's funny.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.807
I'm sorry.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.025
Man, what the fuck
you doing here?

24:45.025 --> 24:48.612
Yeah, Emmett
was kind enough to invite me.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.405
Man, don't drag him
in your bullshit.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.449
Naw, I'm investing
in his future.

24:52.449 --> 24:56.077
I invested in yours,
and look where you wound up.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.788
Oh, congratulations,
by the way.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.460
I believe the words you're
looking for are "thank you."

25:03.460 --> 25:04.920
Fuck you.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.048
I think you need to watch
how you talk to me.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.008
I'm the one
with the government seat.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.762
So I think you need to watch
how the fuck you talk to me.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.766
Just stay the fuck
out of my way.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.892
Yeah, you do the same.

a little budget,

Everything is expensive

to each other no more.

47:39.606 --> 47:42.067
Mm.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.570

the housewarming gift.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.572
You don't smoke cigars.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.699
- I do.
- Since when?

48:30.699 --> 48:31.783
Since, like, a week ago.

48:31.783 --> 48:34.870
So it was a gift for you,
not for us?

48:34.870 --> 48:37.080
It's a gift
for the whole family.
