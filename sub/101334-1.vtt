WEBVTT

01:20.328 --> 01:22.163
Mr. Raeburn?

01:22.197 --> 01:24.400
It's Cathy Delano
from Social Services.

01:25.566 --> 01:26.835
We spoke on the phone?

04:03.391 --> 04:06.394
I want it,
I want the house.

04:17.406 --> 04:18.240
I've eaten.

04:19.374 --> 04:21.878
See what you can
find in the kitchen.

04:45.634 --> 04:47.069
You think you know

04:47.101 --> 04:50.072
about the nature of my parental
responsibility towards you

04:50.105 --> 04:53.742
but soon you'll realize that
my parental responsibility

04:53.774 --> 04:54.609
is not the issue.

04:54.642 --> 04:58.713
Food is the issue.

04:58.747 --> 05:01.283
Parental responsibility
construct is irrelevant.

05:02.550 --> 05:04.152
You're still going
to bed hungry.

05:06.420 --> 05:10.793
Do you understand?

05:12.627 --> 05:14.796
Do you finally understand?

05:59.007 --> 06:01.110
You've got an audience.

06:03.345 --> 06:04.714
That's ridiculous.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.826
They look good on you.

06:24.699 --> 06:25.800
Got it, Jo.

06:27.201 --> 06:29.204
Uh, 8.57.

06:32.473 --> 06:34.509
You're those
Raeburn kids, right?

06:34.543 --> 06:36.211
No, we're the other ones.

06:42.983 --> 06:43.818
He likes you.

06:45.086 --> 06:47.288
Couldn't take his eyes off you.

06:47.322 --> 06:48.524
Well, we're the
mysterious recluses

06:48.557 --> 06:50.826
who don't go to school, so.

06:53.028 --> 06:55.864
You gonna
wear those sunglasses

06:55.896 --> 06:57.165
I bought for you or what?

07:15.050 --> 07:16.852
Take functional relationships.

07:16.884 --> 07:19.153
We design the experiments
that define them,

07:19.187 --> 07:20.556
we give them names,

07:20.588 --> 07:22.057
we spend centuries proving
and reproving them,

07:22.089 --> 07:24.192
but we don't create them.

07:24.225 --> 07:27.161
They're invisible machines
existing outside of us.

07:27.194 --> 07:31.433
I am talking, children,
about constants.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.902
Jack, gimme an
example of a constant.

07:34.935 --> 07:37.438
Gravity.

07:37.471 --> 07:39.942
Well, you mighta
been right 60 years ago

07:39.975 --> 07:43.879
before space travel and
experimental antigravity aircraft.

07:43.911 --> 07:45.179
Josephine.

07:45.213 --> 07:46.582
Hook's Law.

07:46.615 --> 07:48.283
Which is?

07:48.315 --> 07:49.584
The ratio of
weight on a spring

07:49.617 --> 07:51.086
to the elongation of a spring.

07:51.119 --> 07:54.123
Good, the relationship
between weight and tension.

07:54.156 --> 07:56.891
Always constant,
always the same.

07:56.925 --> 07:59.795
Nature makes sense, children.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.697
We're the ones who
fucked it all up.

08:01.730 --> 08:04.299
Countries, governments,
all false constructs

08:04.331 --> 08:05.600
created by the human urge

08:05.634 --> 08:07.836
to carve, to parcel, to own.

08:09.137 --> 08:10.105
Josephine.

08:12.473 --> 08:13.608
You're not eating.

08:16.677 --> 08:17.512
Eat.

08:25.187 --> 08:27.256
Three more
days until he's gone.

08:28.189 --> 08:29.625
Two days, one morning.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.799
I think you should make
friends with that kid

08:37.832 --> 08:39.000
from the drugstore.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.169
Why?

08:42.870 --> 08:45.140
To let us sneak that
stuff behind the counter.

08:46.341 --> 08:48.476
Maybe you can even try
your hand at flirting.

08:48.509 --> 08:49.745
Are you kidding?

08:49.778 --> 08:51.113
You know the only boy
that I talk to is you.

08:51.145 --> 08:52.780
No, don't worry.

08:52.813 --> 08:54.382
You can talk circles around him.

08:57.652 --> 08:59.722
I mean, you had him
the moment he saw you.

09:02.190 --> 09:03.025
Consider.

09:04.225 --> 09:07.528
Friday afternoon,
Raeburn comes home

09:07.562 --> 09:09.096
in a foul mood as usual,

09:09.129 --> 09:10.599
ranting and throwing things

09:10.631 --> 09:13.267
and there's you and me in
the middle of it like always.

09:13.301 --> 09:15.838
Except this time, we
dropped a couple Valium

09:15.870 --> 09:18.841
a few hours back, and we're
feeling no pain whatsoever.

09:18.874 --> 09:20.442
And then he
throws a plate at my head

09:20.475 --> 09:21.844
and I'm too doped to duck.

09:23.211 --> 09:25.614
I'll catch it
before it hits you.

09:25.647 --> 09:28.217
Throw it right the
fuck back at him.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.684
Or we could just
drug his coffee

09:29.717 --> 09:32.053
and then he'd leave us alone.

09:45.366 --> 09:46.868
Try again.

09:46.902 --> 09:48.903
Something other
than my old T-shirt.

09:48.937 --> 09:50.538
I like your old T-shirt.

09:50.572 --> 09:52.206
Trust me.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.408
And take down your hair.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.611
It's too fucking hot.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.230
Uh, where's the toothpaste?

10:15.263 --> 10:17.032
Uh, just on your left.

10:22.870 --> 10:23.771
Your name is Jo?

10:25.105 --> 10:26.908
It um, it's Josie.

10:26.942 --> 10:28.243
It's short for Josephine.

10:28.275 --> 10:30.544
I just, I heard your
brother call you Jo

10:30.577 --> 10:31.913
when you guys were here last.

10:31.947 --> 10:32.780
Oh.

10:35.884 --> 10:36.719
I'm Kevin.

10:40.054 --> 10:41.823
So do you go to the movies much?

10:43.124 --> 10:44.125
Not often.

10:45.460 --> 10:47.429
I, well, do you like music?

10:48.629 --> 10:50.432
What's
taking you so long?

10:50.465 --> 10:51.300
Huh?

10:52.167 --> 10:53.100
Hey.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.235
This is Kevin.

10:54.269 --> 10:55.671
We were talking about music.

10:56.638 --> 10:57.940
Oh yeah?

10:57.972 --> 10:59.573
What kind?

10:59.606 --> 11:00.608
We hadn't really got that far

11:00.642 --> 11:02.277
but I'm really

11:02.309 --> 11:06.447
into like early jazz, hard
bop, that kinda stuff.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.982
Oh nice.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.985
I just picked up "Blue Train"
down in Pittsburgh at Eide's.

11:11.019 --> 11:12.287
I haven't been but I hear

11:12.320 --> 11:14.122
that they've got
everything there.

11:14.154 --> 11:15.456
They do.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.759
You wanna come by later,
listen to some Coltrane,

11:17.792 --> 11:19.561
have a couple beers?

11:19.594 --> 11:20.362
Okay.

11:42.649 --> 11:43.451
Hi.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.320
Hi.

11:46.553 --> 11:48.456
Um, I like your dress.

11:49.691 --> 11:51.125
Thanks, it was my mother's.

11:58.832 --> 12:02.670
I've never been in one
of these old houses before.

12:02.703 --> 12:05.039
My mom's crazy about 'em.

12:06.341 --> 12:08.376
She does the historic
homes tour every spring.

12:10.311 --> 12:11.080
Are you on that?

12:12.547 --> 12:16.018
We're not a very open to
the public kind of a family.

12:16.051 --> 12:17.219
Yeah, I guess not.

12:25.826 --> 12:27.995
But I'm sure none of
those other houses

12:28.028 --> 12:30.064
have as much cool
stuff in 'em as yours.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.369
Greetings.

12:34.402 --> 12:35.537
Hey.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.504
Oh, thanks.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.706
Yeah.

12:37.739 --> 12:38.941
This place is amazing.

12:39.874 --> 12:42.177
Looks like it should be haunted.

12:42.210 --> 12:43.711
Is it?

12:43.745 --> 12:44.980
Only by us.

12:45.013 --> 12:46.148
Wait here a minute.

12:46.181 --> 12:47.115
I'll be right back.

12:52.386 --> 12:53.888
I think it's great
that you and your brother

12:53.922 --> 12:55.423
are so close.

12:55.456 --> 12:57.426
If I had to spend more than
15 minutes with my sister,

12:57.458 --> 12:59.427
I think one of us
would kill the other.

13:00.595 --> 13:02.596
I just think it's
different with us.

13:02.629 --> 13:03.966
Yeah, I think so too.

13:07.701 --> 13:10.337
Jesus, do you have any
more tricks up your sleeve?

13:10.370 --> 13:11.505
Josie might have

13:11.538 --> 13:13.274
one or two more
surprises left in her.

13:16.311 --> 13:17.146
Company first.

13:47.841 --> 13:50.211
It's hideous, isn't it?

13:50.245 --> 13:51.746
Looks like a friend of mine.

13:58.452 --> 14:00.488
Why do you call
your dad Raeburn?

14:03.524 --> 14:06.028
I don't know, I guess
we always kinda just have.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.932
Is he gonna be
mad that I was here?

14:10.965 --> 14:13.000
No, he's not gonna
be back for days.

14:15.302 --> 14:17.972
He teaches physics
up at the college.

14:18.005 --> 14:19.140
And he doesn't like the commute

14:19.173 --> 14:20.574
so he just stays
there during the week.

14:20.607 --> 14:22.009
I thought he homeschooled you.

14:22.043 --> 14:23.678
He does, just on the weekends.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.316
What about your mom?

14:28.349 --> 14:29.718
She died when I was a kid.

14:30.684 --> 14:31.686
No, it's fine.

14:33.020 --> 14:35.189
I never met her but Jack did.

15:13.660 --> 15:14.729
I kissed him.

15:16.063 --> 15:18.000
You were supposed to.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.072
Factoring
polynomial equations.

15:25.405 --> 15:26.707
It just all
seems like guesswork,

15:26.740 --> 15:30.044
like there's no process.

15:30.077 --> 15:30.978
You're scared, girl.

15:31.011 --> 15:32.513
You're so paralyzed with fear

15:32.547 --> 15:34.548
that you can't even make
a simple deductive leap

15:34.581 --> 15:36.184
without a process to guide you.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.888
Let's examine a hypothetical.

15:39.921 --> 15:41.590
Say you were given a choice

15:41.623 --> 15:43.557
to study with me here at home

15:43.591 --> 15:44.826
or go to the idiot factory

15:44.859 --> 15:47.429
with all the other kids
and be spoonfed theory

15:47.461 --> 15:49.029
like pureed vegetables.

15:49.062 --> 15:50.064
What do you choose?

15:51.265 --> 15:52.233
Huh?

15:52.267 --> 15:53.501
- I...
- No, you wouldn't go.

15:53.533 --> 15:54.668
You wouldn't dare put
yourself at the mercy

15:54.701 --> 15:55.870
of the outside world.

15:55.903 --> 15:57.872
But let's say that
you were normal, okay?

15:57.904 --> 16:00.207
A normal girl with
a normal upbringing.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.843
Doll houses, ballet, a
mommy who baked cookies,

16:02.876 --> 16:04.578
never an unhappy
day in your life,

16:04.611 --> 16:07.348
never an original
thought in your skull.

16:07.381 --> 16:08.349
What do you choose then?

16:13.921 --> 16:15.090
I don't know.

16:15.123 --> 16:15.958
I guess I've never
been that way.

16:23.965 --> 16:25.399
Well,
thank God for that.

16:29.470 --> 16:31.505
Thinking about
your new boyfriend?

16:32.673 --> 16:33.507
Stop.

16:35.643 --> 16:37.144
Oh shit, you are.

16:37.177 --> 16:38.078
Look at you.

16:38.111 --> 16:39.046
Are you blushing?

16:39.080 --> 16:41.449
No, I'm, no, no.

16:41.481 --> 16:43.317
No, I'm not in love
with him, Jack.

16:44.818 --> 16:46.487
Yeah, but you like him.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.521
He's nice.

16:48.623 --> 16:49.424
He's an idiot.

16:49.456 --> 16:51.293
No, he's not an idiot.

16:51.326 --> 16:52.159
He's normal.

17:00.335 --> 17:02.737
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like

17:02.769 --> 17:03.771
to just be normal?

17:08.509 --> 17:09.845
You'd hate it.

17:17.184 --> 17:19.520
I mean, how high tech
can the security system be?

17:19.554 --> 17:20.788
It's not.

17:20.820 --> 17:22.690
I just think it's more
trouble than it's worth.

17:25.526 --> 17:28.897
Just think about it,
it's all I'm saying.

17:29.797 --> 17:30.798
All right.

17:46.346 --> 17:47.848
He's so beautiful.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.369
No, I can't, I can't do this.

18:07.402 --> 18:08.470
No, I can't do this.

18:08.502 --> 18:09.337
I'm sorry.

18:13.374 --> 18:15.043
I really like you, Josie.

18:16.243 --> 18:18.679
You like this life but
you don't even know me.

18:18.712 --> 18:19.880
You just like the package.

18:19.913 --> 18:22.016
Okay, you have got
me totally wrong.

18:22.048 --> 18:23.718
I like coming here
but, you know,

18:23.750 --> 18:25.886
with my friends, we go to
parties and we go to the mall

18:25.920 --> 18:27.389
and we do things.

18:27.422 --> 18:30.158
And here, all we do is we sit
around in this living room,

18:30.191 --> 18:31.393
we smoke pot with your brother.

18:31.425 --> 18:33.227
And I like him, I
like Jack, but...

18:36.696 --> 18:37.664
It's you, Josie.

18:37.698 --> 18:40.435
I'm here for you.

19:03.924 --> 19:04.725
- Ah, ow!
- Oh.

19:04.759 --> 19:05.626
Are you all right?

19:05.660 --> 19:06.795
You just hurt my hair here.

19:06.827 --> 19:07.461
- Did you hurt her?
- Got my hair.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.596
Did you fucking

19:08.628 --> 19:09.730
- hurt my sister, huh?
- No, no!

19:09.763 --> 19:10.798
- I didn't, she's fine,
- Jack, Jack!

19:10.832 --> 19:11.766
- she's fine.
- I'm fine, look at me.

19:11.798 --> 19:13.902
Let him go.

19:13.934 --> 19:14.769
I'm fine.

19:15.903 --> 19:16.805
He just caught my hair.

19:17.637 --> 19:18.472
It's fine.

19:21.142 --> 19:21.977
Go home.

19:50.704 --> 19:51.705
Josephine!

19:52.539 --> 19:53.974
Jack!

19:54.008 --> 19:55.143
Come in here.

19:55.175 --> 19:56.343
Have a drink.

20:05.051 --> 20:07.521
A toast to the two of you.

20:08.823 --> 20:11.359
You insane fucking
children.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.497
Ah, you're the
world's only hope.

20:16.797 --> 20:17.665
Sit down.

20:26.007 --> 20:29.811
Would you like to hear what
your father did this week?

20:29.844 --> 20:31.179
Sure.

20:31.211 --> 20:32.646
How was the office, Daddy?

20:32.680 --> 20:33.548
Ghastly.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.215
I'm surrounded by idiots.

20:35.249 --> 20:37.352
Professor Ben Sorrells,

20:37.384 --> 20:39.820
rockstar scientist himself.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.156
He's up for tenure.

20:43.190 --> 20:44.558
And he'll get it, too.

20:46.426 --> 20:49.696
May his teeth fall out
and his limbs wither

20:49.730 --> 20:53.300
one by one into uselessness.

20:53.334 --> 20:54.836
I thought
Sorrells was harmless.

20:54.868 --> 20:59.374
Sorrells is a human plague

20:59.406 --> 21:01.509
who spends more time on his hair

21:01.541 --> 21:03.343
than he does his research.

21:03.376 --> 21:04.244
Not to worry, children.

21:04.278 --> 21:05.880
I have a plan.

21:05.913 --> 21:07.781
I have a man on the inside.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.986
Well, a woman.

21:12.019 --> 21:13.421
Margaret Revolt.

21:14.588 --> 21:17.157
She's enrolled in
one of his classes.

21:17.191 --> 21:20.094
Sometimes I think that I
should bring her up here.

21:20.126 --> 21:22.829
You, in particular, Josephine,

21:22.863 --> 21:24.932
you would benefit
from knowing her.

21:24.965 --> 21:27.367
Oh, by all means bring her up.

21:27.401 --> 21:28.870
You'd know I love to meet her.

21:29.737 --> 21:31.906
Margaret would eat

21:31.939 --> 21:34.142
you alive, boy.

21:36.376 --> 21:38.278
I haven't had such
a promising student

21:38.311 --> 21:39.513
since your mother,

21:39.547 --> 21:41.783
for all the good
her promise did her.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.420
All those years under
my careful tutelage,

21:45.452 --> 21:47.622
and what did she give the world?

21:47.654 --> 21:50.291
What is the grand end result?

21:53.126 --> 21:53.961
You.

21:55.630 --> 21:56.464
Vain,

21:58.332 --> 22:01.769
shallow, lazy, superficial.

22:01.801 --> 22:04.138
Put that goddamn thing down!

22:05.905 --> 22:07.442
I'm done with you, both of you.

22:07.474 --> 22:08.942
Get outta here.

22:08.976 --> 22:09.811
Get out.

22:18.184 --> 22:19.419
You sure
you left it unlocked?

22:19.452 --> 22:22.123
I told you, I
taped down the bolt.

22:25.326 --> 22:26.126
There.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.261
Okay.

22:27.294 --> 22:28.229
The camera should be off.

22:28.261 --> 22:30.164
It better be off.

22:37.304 --> 22:39.374
Hey, come on, hurry up.

22:43.344 --> 22:44.612
Remember you promised
you wouldn't go crazy.

22:44.644 --> 22:47.181
Just a couple pills.

22:47.213 --> 22:48.349
Couple, couple dozen,

22:49.215 --> 22:50.350
really what's the difference?

22:50.384 --> 22:51.219
Jack.

22:53.354 --> 22:54.189
Jack, please.

23:07.667 --> 23:09.336
You sure
you don't want any?

23:10.704 --> 23:13.674
I can't risk getting caught
with any of that stuff.

23:13.708 --> 23:14.676
But thanks.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.044
Oh no, thank you.

23:17.711 --> 23:20.749
Admit it, being bad is fun.

23:22.215 --> 23:24.151
I'm not sure that's
the word I'd use.

23:25.986 --> 23:27.889
Kevin, you won't
have to do this again.

23:29.824 --> 23:30.592
Okay.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.463
Hey, Kev, relax, man.

23:36.497 --> 23:37.731
Let's have another drink?

23:51.412 --> 23:52.380
I'll be back.

23:52.413 --> 23:53.248
Okay.

24:00.453 --> 24:02.222
Enjoying yourself?

24:02.256 --> 24:03.691
Yes.

24:03.723 --> 24:04.692
Good.

24:07.528 --> 24:09.163
'Cause this is the last night.

24:09.195 --> 24:10.564
What?

24:10.597 --> 24:12.899
Well, we don't
need him anymore.

24:12.932 --> 24:14.736
Just tell him to take a hike.

24:14.769 --> 24:15.569
No.

24:15.603 --> 24:16.537
Yes.

24:18.471 --> 24:20.075
I like him, Jack.

24:24.111 --> 24:25.346
This was your idea, okay?

24:25.378 --> 24:26.680
All of this was your idea.

24:26.713 --> 24:29.383
It was my idea to
milk him for the drugs.

24:29.415 --> 24:31.918
It was not my idea to sit
upstairs by myself all night

24:31.951 --> 24:35.021
while he fucks my little
sister on the family couch.

24:35.055 --> 24:36.257
Josie.

24:36.289 --> 24:37.557
One second.

24:37.590 --> 24:38.959
Did he tell you
that he loves you?

24:40.294 --> 24:41.095
Hmm?

24:43.230 --> 24:44.531
Did you believe him?

24:47.968 --> 24:50.138
I'm the only person
who's ever loved you.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.109
The only person in
the entire world.

25:06.820 --> 25:07.688
You'll call me?

25:09.490 --> 25:10.825
I said I would, didn't I?

25:39.118 --> 25:40.687
Did you send him packing?

25:45.558 --> 25:46.394
Good girl.

25:50.029 --> 25:52.232
There's a gap
between us and them.

25:53.534 --> 25:54.502
You can't bridge it.

25:54.535 --> 25:56.137
You're not like them.

25:56.170 --> 25:58.006
You're never gonna be.

25:59.472 --> 26:00.808
We're different.

26:02.175 --> 26:03.211
We're better.

27:02.135 --> 27:05.272
The annual faculty
party is next Friday.

27:05.306 --> 27:06.774
It's the sort of
ridiculous event

27:06.807 --> 27:08.075
that I normally try to avoid

27:08.107 --> 27:11.444
but this thing with Sorrells,

27:11.478 --> 27:14.115
I can't afford to be antisocial.

27:15.816 --> 27:17.585
You two will come as well.

27:17.617 --> 27:18.719
We'll put on a show.

27:18.751 --> 27:20.354
Happy, charming family.

27:20.386 --> 27:21.154
No way.

27:25.159 --> 27:26.794
You have somewhere else to be?

27:28.729 --> 27:29.564
Maybe I do.

27:31.131 --> 27:32.233
You do what you like.

27:33.433 --> 27:34.902
But if I don't see
you at that party

27:34.934 --> 27:37.605
then I'd better not see
you back here either.

27:37.637 --> 27:39.072
Do we understand each other?

27:40.673 --> 27:42.042
Go to hell.

27:42.076 --> 27:43.743
So well spoken.

27:43.777 --> 27:45.145
You sound like your mother.

27:46.313 --> 27:47.748
And we all know
how she ended up.

27:49.282 --> 27:52.218
Decomposing in a pool of
her own vomit, wasn't it?

27:52.251 --> 27:54.454
She counted on all the
biological trinkets

27:54.488 --> 27:55.623
that you two see in the mirror

27:55.655 --> 27:56.923
to make her way for her.

27:56.957 --> 27:58.960
You'd find yourself as
lost in the real world

27:58.992 --> 28:00.594
as she did.

28:00.626 --> 28:02.495
I've built you two a
lovely little world

28:02.528 --> 28:04.632
where you won't ever
become what she was,

28:04.664 --> 28:06.133
and all that I ask
is that you show up

28:06.165 --> 28:08.802
at a party and play
nice for my colleagues.

28:08.836 --> 28:09.971
Fuck you!

28:10.003 --> 28:10.837
Jack.

28:50.210 --> 28:52.880
Let's just get this over with.

29:15.335 --> 29:17.171
You must
be Joseph's kids.

29:18.105 --> 29:19.039
Have we met?

29:19.073 --> 29:20.240
Not that you'd remember.

29:20.273 --> 29:22.142
You were only children.

29:22.175 --> 29:23.376
I'm Claire.

29:23.410 --> 29:25.146
My office is down the
hall from your father's.

29:25.179 --> 29:26.680
Chemistry.

29:26.712 --> 29:28.214
I'm not sure if physicists
should be allowed to breed

29:28.248 --> 29:29.917
without prior consent.

29:29.950 --> 29:32.720
But you two seemed to
have turned out all right.

29:33.586 --> 29:35.489
No, we're painfully average.

29:35.521 --> 29:36.758
I'm unconvinced.

29:39.593 --> 29:40.894
We have to get
back to our father.

29:40.928 --> 29:41.862
Excuse us.

29:41.894 --> 29:42.730
I'll join you.

29:42.762 --> 29:43.763
I should say hello.

29:45.365 --> 29:48.036
God, is everyone at this
party gonna hit on us?

29:49.769 --> 29:52.605
Eugene, listen, what
can possibly be left

29:52.638 --> 29:55.075
of quantum mechanics
after being filtered

29:55.108 --> 29:58.578
through a brain raised on
30-second promotional spots?

29:58.612 --> 30:01.048
A pseudo revolution led
by pseudo scientists

30:01.080 --> 30:04.184
whose only hypothesis
is black holes are sexy.

30:04.218 --> 30:06.787
I'm not saying Ben
is a brilliant theorist

30:06.819 --> 30:08.588
but he is a wonderful teacher.

30:08.622 --> 30:10.858
Being popular doesn't make
you a wonderful teacher.

30:10.891 --> 30:12.293
Might make you prom king...

30:12.326 --> 30:14.095
You're only jealous because
you didn't get to stand up

30:14.127 --> 30:16.696
on stage and wear
the crown, Joseph.

30:16.730 --> 30:18.199
Don't worry, dear.

30:18.231 --> 30:20.067
I'll ask you to the next
Sadie Hawkins.

30:29.308 --> 30:31.645
You see how
Margaret Revolt looks at him?

30:33.247 --> 30:34.182
That's pathetic.

30:37.817 --> 30:39.787
I'm drunk and I'm stoned.

30:39.819 --> 30:40.954
Let's just go home.

30:44.124 --> 30:45.492
Gimme five minutes.

30:57.503 --> 30:59.339
Whoa.

30:59.373 --> 31:00.673
Oh, sorry about that.

31:00.707 --> 31:01.642
Sorry about that.

31:01.674 --> 31:02.976
It's okay.

31:03.009 --> 31:04.345
- Okay.
- I am so sorry.

31:04.377 --> 31:05.178
It's okay.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.079
Are you okay?

31:06.113 --> 31:07.315
I'm fine, um...

31:10.951 --> 31:13.120
You're Ben Sorrells.

31:13.153 --> 31:14.521
Yes, I am.

31:15.454 --> 31:16.923
I'm Josie Raeburn.

31:16.957 --> 31:18.926
Oh, right, yes.

31:18.959 --> 31:19.860
I shoulda realized that.

31:19.893 --> 31:21.662
There's a family resemblance.

31:21.694 --> 31:23.329
You know, I've been
hearing about you

31:23.363 --> 31:24.932
since I started teaching.

31:24.964 --> 31:26.500
Not from my father.

31:26.532 --> 31:27.467
No.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.434
From everybody else though.

31:28.468 --> 31:30.171
Every time his name comes up

31:30.203 --> 31:33.173
somebody always says,
"Wait'll you meet his kids."

31:33.207 --> 31:35.676
Wait till you meet
his kids to do what?

31:35.709 --> 31:36.610
Well, they just all, they say

31:36.643 --> 31:37.678
that you're really something,

31:37.711 --> 31:40.014
that you're
good-looking and smart

31:40.047 --> 31:41.214
and all the things that we seem

31:41.248 --> 31:43.084
to really like people
for these days.

31:44.684 --> 31:47.153
You know, your father,
he's brilliant, you know.

31:47.186 --> 31:48.354
Not my...

31:48.387 --> 31:49.856
My father's a raging
son-of-a-bitch.

31:49.890 --> 31:50.691
Excuse me.

31:50.723 --> 31:51.558
Are you okay?

31:55.695 --> 31:56.563
She's okay.

31:56.596 --> 31:57.999
Just steer clear of the shrimp.

31:58.932 --> 32:00.567
You all right?

32:00.601 --> 32:02.002
Wanna get some air?

32:02.035 --> 32:03.037
What's going on.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.003
What's wrong?

32:04.037 --> 32:05.206
She wasn't feeling good.

32:05.239 --> 32:06.507
I can handle it
from here, Sorrells.

32:08.741 --> 32:10.543
In front of my
colleagues, Josephine?

32:10.576 --> 32:11.377
I'm sorry.

32:11.411 --> 32:12.212
Who gave it to you?

32:12.246 --> 32:13.547
Was it Sorrells?

32:13.579 --> 32:15.215
What she didn't get
herself I got for her.

32:15.249 --> 32:16.584
She's sick enough already.

32:16.616 --> 32:17.817
Oh, excellent, boy.

32:17.851 --> 32:19.086
You get your sister drunk,

32:19.118 --> 32:20.320
your 16-year-old sister

32:20.354 --> 32:21.555
drunk in public.

32:21.587 --> 32:23.590
Oh, as opposed to in
private where it's okay?

32:26.759 --> 32:28.395
Well, take her
if you want her.

32:29.262 --> 32:31.432
You've already ruined her.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.236
You're okay now.

32:35.269 --> 32:36.237
You're okay.

32:36.269 --> 32:37.770
I gotcha.

33:14.307 --> 33:15.643
I know you're
in there, Raeburn.

33:15.675 --> 33:18.111
I can fucking smell you!

33:23.450 --> 33:25.586
Goddamn it, Raeburn,
get out here!

33:27.953 --> 33:28.688
Raeburn!

33:30.656 --> 33:32.625
You fucking liar!

33:32.659 --> 33:35.796
Raeburn!

33:35.828 --> 33:37.464
Raeburn, I know you're in there.

33:38.498 --> 33:39.967
Get out here.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.402
Sorrells
is at the door.

33:41.434 --> 33:43.503
Well then, perhaps
we should let him in.

33:47.340 --> 33:48.141
Go get your father.

33:48.174 --> 33:49.109
I know he's in there.

33:52.878 --> 33:54.113
Something I can help you with?

33:54.146 --> 33:56.149
You know damn well
why I'm here, Raeburn.

33:56.182 --> 33:57.518
Tell her to go inside.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.319
Why, will it destroy
her good image of you

33:59.353 --> 34:01.455
to learn that you sleep
with your students?

34:01.488 --> 34:03.824
I didn't sleep with Margaret
Revolt and you know it.

34:03.856 --> 34:06.326
Look, Josephine,
Benjamin just discovered

34:06.359 --> 34:07.994
that life is unfair.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.896
Aren't you glad you
already know that?

34:11.030 --> 34:12.833
You unbelievable bastard.

34:12.864 --> 34:14.201
It's unfortunate.

34:14.233 --> 34:16.603
Perhaps in your next position
you'll be more careful

34:16.635 --> 34:18.471
around your female students.

34:18.505 --> 34:19.273
You can't do this.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.940
You can't do this!

34:20.974 --> 34:21.809
Raeburn!

34:22.842 --> 34:24.545
Raeburn, you fucking liar.

34:24.577 --> 34:28.514
You call them and you
tell them it's not true!

34:28.547 --> 34:29.849
Raeburn, goddamn it!

34:29.882 --> 34:31.650
In place of it.

34:31.684 --> 34:33.652
You have all my backing.

34:35.355 --> 34:37.358
I got something for you.

35:03.784 --> 35:06.387
Josephine, get down here now!

35:16.429 --> 35:18.098
You little ingrates.

35:21.568 --> 35:24.438
He went in my office.

35:27.474 --> 35:28.309
He took

35:30.409 --> 35:32.212
something that belongs to me.

35:34.047 --> 35:34.882
A letter.

35:35.815 --> 35:36.983
Did you help him?

35:38.117 --> 35:39.552
Did you help him?

35:41.420 --> 35:43.289
You stupid little shit!

35:44.123 --> 35:45.291
Goddamn idiot!

35:48.961 --> 35:50.898
Your brother just ruined me.

35:52.766 --> 35:53.601
He's...

35:55.135 --> 35:56.604
This is my house!

35:59.606 --> 36:02.276
You think you count
for something here?

36:02.309 --> 36:03.444
You're nothing.

36:03.476 --> 36:05.645
You're just a couple of viruses

36:05.679 --> 36:09.081
that your mother left
behind for me to deal with.

36:09.114 --> 36:11.217
Everything about you

36:11.251 --> 36:14.121
is a waste of my time.

36:14.153 --> 36:14.989
Please stop.

36:24.797 --> 36:27.500
Oh no, no, he's gone, he left.

36:27.534 --> 36:28.836
He's not coming back.

36:28.869 --> 36:31.838
You, you backed the wrong horse.

36:31.871 --> 36:33.606
Yeah, that's what you did.

36:33.639 --> 36:35.542
You backed the wrong...

36:47.387 --> 36:48.956
Then.

36:48.989 --> 36:49.889
All right.

38:23.148 --> 38:24.351
Hello?

38:24.384 --> 38:27.019
Josie,
it's Ben Sorrells.

38:27.052 --> 38:28.422
Tell your father
that Margaret Revolt

38:28.454 --> 38:31.057
is going to confess
to the false report,

38:31.090 --> 38:31.891
to all of it.

38:32.925 --> 38:33.726
I can't do that.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.595
He'll kill me.

38:35.961 --> 38:38.297
Will you thank
your brother for me?

38:38.331 --> 38:39.132
Jack's not here.

38:39.164 --> 38:40.000
He left.

38:41.735 --> 38:43.470
Why didn't
you go with him?

38:45.304 --> 38:46.673
Josie.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.077
You know this isn't
the way the world is.

38:51.110 --> 38:53.279
People acting like this.

38:53.313 --> 38:54.213
It doesn't matter.

39:03.456 --> 39:04.324
There's
somebody coming

39:04.356 --> 39:05.793
to pick up the truck this week.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.996
I want it gone.

39:10.030 --> 39:11.498
It's been long enough.

39:14.634 --> 39:17.670
Your brother spent eight years
too long with that woman.

39:19.039 --> 39:20.974
He will always try
to charm the world

39:21.007 --> 39:22.643
out of its basket
and he'll die angry

39:22.675 --> 39:24.610
because it doesn't work.

39:24.643 --> 39:25.511
Just like she did.

39:56.208 --> 39:57.043
Hey.

40:03.817 --> 40:04.985
I saw my room.

40:06.351 --> 40:08.688
Guess I'm outta the
family for good now, huh?

40:17.864 --> 40:19.066
Where's the key to this?

40:20.733 --> 40:22.168
Why?

40:22.202 --> 40:23.370
Because I need money.

40:24.436 --> 40:25.672
It's mine, if you needed it,

40:25.704 --> 40:28.141
you should've taken
it when you left.

40:28.173 --> 40:29.208
Trying to make me feel guilty

40:29.242 --> 40:31.411
isn't gonna get you anywhere.

40:31.443 --> 40:33.980
You think I wanted
to leave you here?

40:34.012 --> 40:35.516
You must've because you did.

40:37.416 --> 40:38.251
Josie.

40:40.586 --> 40:41.922
I came back for you.

40:58.070 --> 40:59.172
Whose car is this?

40:59.204 --> 41:00.740
Becka.

41:00.773 --> 41:02.074
You'll meet her.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.753
You can go to sleep if you want.

41:13.786 --> 41:16.456
It's gonna take us a few
hours to get to Erie.

41:47.420 --> 41:48.255
Josie.

41:49.822 --> 41:50.623
We're here.

42:08.507 --> 42:10.176
Becka should be home soon.

42:24.190 --> 42:26.592
Does your pop
know you're here.

42:26.626 --> 42:27.894
It doesn't matter.

42:28.827 --> 42:31.197
Ignore me.

42:31.231 --> 42:32.699
I didn't mean nothin'.

42:32.731 --> 42:34.300
I never mean nothin'.

42:34.333 --> 42:35.201
Half the things

42:35.235 --> 42:36.336
that come out of my mouth

42:36.369 --> 42:37.003
you can't even
listen to.

42:37.036 --> 42:37.938
Hear, hear.

42:47.045 --> 42:48.214
I'm kinda tired.

42:48.248 --> 42:50.684
Is there somewhere
that I can lie down?

42:50.717 --> 42:52.052
Sure thing, sweetie.

42:52.085 --> 42:55.487
This here couch folds out.

42:55.521 --> 42:56.757
We'll just leave you be.

43:42.201 --> 43:44.403
Well, hey there, sweetie.

43:44.436 --> 43:46.373
What do you think
of little ol' Becka?

43:48.440 --> 43:50.242
I think your
accent's bullshit.

43:52.945 --> 43:53.779
I missed you.

44:01.454 --> 44:02.289
Okay.

44:09.795 --> 44:12.231
You didn't tell me this
is a part of the plan.

44:15.635 --> 44:17.304
Look, we'll get
out of here soon.

44:18.271 --> 44:19.139
I promise.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.777
In the meantime,
this is a good setup.

44:24.911 --> 44:26.813
Becka rakes it in down
at the strip club.

44:29.449 --> 44:30.250
How soon?

44:32.751 --> 44:33.585
Soon.

44:38.590 --> 44:40.693
We'll go somewhere good.

44:43.329 --> 44:44.298
Big city.

44:45.597 --> 44:47.833
Nobody to bother us.

44:49.135 --> 44:50.671
Nobody will know
anything about us.

44:56.009 --> 45:00.213
I was just drifting and
this was where I washed up.

45:33.012 --> 45:34.381
You gotta put your hands on.

45:35.514 --> 45:36.315
Let 'em.

45:36.349 --> 45:38.018
You're not playing it.

45:53.900 --> 45:58.171
So, I gotta go
to the mall today.

45:58.204 --> 46:01.875
Figured you'd be tired but if
you wanna come, you could...

46:01.907 --> 46:02.708
It's okay.

46:02.742 --> 46:04.277
I'm fine, thank you.

46:05.744 --> 46:08.313
We should hang out you and me

46:08.347 --> 46:09.883
and get to know each other.

46:09.916 --> 46:12.385
You can tell me all your
brother's dirty little secrets.

46:12.418 --> 46:16.222
Are you
sure you wanna know?

46:16.255 --> 46:19.425
You mean like careful what
you wish for and all that?

46:20.525 --> 46:21.594
Smart girl.

46:22.728 --> 46:24.364
I was mostly
kidding.

46:26.298 --> 46:27.233
I wasn't.

46:29.768 --> 46:30.736
I should be going.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.550
You weren't actually planning
on her staying here, were you?

46:43.583 --> 46:44.851
Like staying staying.

46:44.884 --> 46:46.052
Come on, she's my sister.

46:46.085 --> 46:47.586
I'm not
running a girls' home.

46:47.619 --> 46:49.688
She's taking up my
entire living room.

46:49.722 --> 46:51.391
Couple of weeks, that's it.

46:56.461 --> 46:58.130
We better let
her sit in front.

47:05.771 --> 47:06.773
Hey, gorgeous.

47:06.806 --> 47:07.641
Hey yourself.

47:12.744 --> 47:14.547
Did y'all have a nice night?

47:14.579 --> 47:15.914
Ah, usual.

47:15.947 --> 47:17.416
How was yours?

47:17.449 --> 47:20.619
All I wanna do is
sleep for a hundred years.

47:22.755 --> 47:24.825
Sorry, you have
something to say?

47:26.659 --> 47:27.693
No, I don't.

47:29.128 --> 47:30.463
Yeah.

47:30.496 --> 47:31.664
I bet.

47:31.697 --> 47:33.432
Hey, relax, she
didn't do anything.

47:33.465 --> 47:35.534
No, no, of
course she didn't.

47:47.880 --> 47:48.681
Hey, man.

47:48.713 --> 47:50.083
What's up.

47:50.115 --> 47:50.750
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you doing?

47:50.782 --> 47:51.550
Good.

47:53.518 --> 47:54.620
Where's Becka?

47:54.653 --> 47:55.889
Ah, she's still in bed.

47:57.123 --> 47:58.057
I'll go get her up.

47:59.192 --> 48:00.827
Mark, my sister Josie.

48:23.882 --> 48:25.050
Bad news.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.318
She's tired.

48:26.351 --> 48:27.987
The two of us are just
gonna hang out here.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.856
You two should go though.

48:30.889 --> 48:31.723
Jack.

48:31.757 --> 48:32.659
Go, Josie.

48:34.092 --> 48:35.561
There's no reason for you
to sit around her all day.

48:38.396 --> 48:39.231
Fine.

48:52.545 --> 48:54.180
If you think she
planned this, you're right.

48:54.213 --> 48:55.715
She told me about it yesterday.

48:55.748 --> 48:57.416
Somehow that
doesn't brighten my mood.

48:57.449 --> 48:59.051
Well, I'm
not saying it should

48:59.085 --> 49:00.619
but you can't really blame her.

49:02.221 --> 49:04.157
There she was, living
with your brother

49:04.190 --> 49:05.992
who treats her good mostly.

49:06.025 --> 49:07.360
And then along comes
a 16-year-old sister

49:07.393 --> 49:09.061
and all of a sudden
he hardly gives her

49:09.094 --> 49:11.763
- the time of day anymore.
- Okay, I'm 17.

49:11.797 --> 49:13.699
Not that that's any
of your business.

49:14.934 --> 49:16.336
How old do you think
Jack is anyway?

49:16.369 --> 49:17.870
Listen.

49:17.902 --> 49:19.338
I'm not saying I don't have
opinions about your brother.

49:19.371 --> 49:20.940
I've got plenty of those.

49:24.242 --> 49:25.711
Come on.

49:25.744 --> 49:26.746
I didn't slog all
the way out here

49:26.778 --> 49:27.947
just to sit in the car.

49:55.940 --> 49:59.311
So what did Becka say when
she asked you to do this?

49:59.344 --> 50:00.679
Uh, exact words?

50:02.414 --> 50:05.284
"Mark, sweetie, Jack's weird
little sister's visiting.

50:05.318 --> 50:07.586
"I need to get her outta
my hair for a day or so.

50:07.619 --> 50:09.422
"You think you could
entertain her?"

50:11.356 --> 50:12.824
She called me weird?

50:12.858 --> 50:13.793
She mighta called you a freak.

50:13.826 --> 50:15.094
I can't really remember.

50:18.664 --> 50:20.166
Hey.

50:20.199 --> 50:21.634
She said you're weird.

50:21.666 --> 50:22.501
So what?

50:23.501 --> 50:24.371
She's weird.

50:25.804 --> 50:26.605
I'm weird.

50:26.639 --> 50:27.474
Who fucking cares?

50:38.818 --> 50:40.186
You know I'm underage.

50:40.219 --> 50:41.320
Sorry.

50:41.353 --> 50:42.454
Becka told me you were 30.

50:42.487 --> 50:44.123
I have no updated information.

50:47.059 --> 50:49.528
So Jack says that
you fence things.

50:51.996 --> 50:54.166
From time to time, I
find homes for objects

50:54.199 --> 50:55.701
that have lost their way, yes.

50:56.869 --> 50:59.639
How does one get
into that occupation?

50:59.672 --> 51:01.474
You're asking a
lot of questions.

51:01.507 --> 51:02.307
Well, I am 30.

51:02.340 --> 51:03.175
I should know.

51:04.710 --> 51:06.512
Yeah, I guess you
are, aren't you?

51:23.228 --> 51:24.196
You know something?

51:25.231 --> 51:26.066
What?

51:27.532 --> 51:29.536
I like you more than
I like your brother.

52:12.311 --> 52:15.213
You are quite
something, Josie Raeburn.

52:15.246 --> 52:17.250
Likewise, Mark
last name unknown.

52:17.282 --> 52:18.083
Mmm hmm.

52:24.155 --> 52:26.291
Hello,
ain't you two cute.

52:26.324 --> 52:27.793
See I was going
for more adorable.

52:30.128 --> 52:30.929
We got a table.

52:31.963 --> 52:33.632
I gotta go to the bathroom.

52:33.666 --> 52:34.767
You okay?

52:34.800 --> 52:35.968
Yeah.

52:42.641 --> 52:44.277
You're cute when you're drunk.

52:49.148 --> 52:51.050
Did Mark make a
move on you today?

52:51.083 --> 52:53.885
Did Becka make a
move on you today?

52:53.918 --> 52:55.887
Well, I kept her happy.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.289
In case you haven't noticed,

52:57.322 --> 52:59.491
it's in our best interest
to keep Becka happy.

52:59.525 --> 53:01.260
Yeah, don't I fucking know it.

53:02.994 --> 53:04.130
You didn't answer my question.

53:07.132 --> 53:08.067
Dance with me.

53:09.768 --> 53:12.271
Dance with me please, Jack.

53:12.304 --> 53:13.806
Jack, just dance with me.

53:13.838 --> 53:14.739
- Jack.
- Hey, let's go.

53:14.773 --> 53:15.508
Why don't I

53:15.541 --> 53:16.476
get you home, okay?

53:16.509 --> 53:17.777
- Let's dance.
- Come on,

53:17.809 --> 53:18.643
it's time for you to go home.

53:18.677 --> 53:19.479
Stop.

53:19.512 --> 53:20.513
Stop, all right?

53:21.447 --> 53:22.347
What's going on?

53:22.380 --> 53:23.482
I'm gonna take her home.

53:23.516 --> 53:24.951
She's pissed drunk.

53:24.983 --> 53:25.784
I don't wanna go home.

53:25.818 --> 53:26.619
I wanna stay.

53:26.652 --> 53:27.586
Okay, so stay.

53:27.619 --> 53:28.855
I'll see you back at the house.

53:28.887 --> 53:30.155
Well, why
can't Mark take her?

53:30.188 --> 53:32.157
Mark's not taking
my sister anywhere.

53:33.025 --> 53:34.160
Your sister.

53:34.193 --> 53:36.162
Your fucking sister.

53:36.195 --> 53:37.730
I didn't sign up for this shit.

53:44.068 --> 53:45.304
I'm tired of her.

53:45.336 --> 53:46.838
Her smug little looks
always watching you

53:46.871 --> 53:48.440
like she's so much
better than me.

53:48.474 --> 53:50.009
- Well, she's not.
- Hey, relax, relax,

53:50.041 --> 53:51.177
- relax, relax.
- You see the way she

53:51.210 --> 53:52.311
- wrapped all over Mark?
- Chill out, okay?

53:52.344 --> 53:53.112
Your
precious little sister?

53:53.144 --> 53:54.347
Just calm down.

53:54.380 --> 53:55.481
Don't you
tell me to calm down.

53:55.514 --> 53:56.782
This is my house!

53:56.815 --> 54:00.019
No, oh oh.

54:00.985 --> 54:01.887
Hey!

54:01.920 --> 54:03.188
That's my brother!

54:03.222 --> 54:04.790
- Oh no!
- Lay off!

54:04.822 --> 54:07.993
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

54:08.027 --> 54:09.161
Not going like this!

54:18.170 --> 54:19.338
You asshole.

54:22.074 --> 54:23.709
You're a snake.

54:24.943 --> 54:25.878
You think just because
you're a good fuck

54:25.911 --> 54:27.213
you can walk all over me?

54:28.681 --> 54:29.548
You hitter!

54:33.619 --> 54:34.687
Get the fuck out!

54:39.891 --> 54:40.759
Get your stuff.

54:43.195 --> 54:44.197
Now, Josie.

55:35.014 --> 55:37.316
Can I get ya?

55:37.349 --> 55:39.418
Eggs, toast, two.

55:39.451 --> 55:40.786
Kinda
eggs, kinda toast?

55:40.818 --> 55:42.255
Over hard, white.

55:43.121 --> 55:45.790
All righty.

55:45.824 --> 55:46.659
Here.

55:49.128 --> 55:49.929
This one.

55:53.931 --> 55:57.502
"Alphabet City studio
sublet available immediately."

56:06.344 --> 56:09.280
Right, so,

56:09.313 --> 56:12.851
it's 350 a month,
mattress included.

56:12.885 --> 56:14.153
You pay me in cash.

56:14.186 --> 56:14.987
No bullshit.

56:15.019 --> 56:16.021
You're late, you're out.

56:17.989 --> 56:18.790
We want it.

56:19.657 --> 56:20.826
I'm Luis.

56:20.858 --> 56:22.527
I'm the super, I
live downstairs.

56:23.561 --> 56:24.630
Rent was due on the 1st,

56:24.663 --> 56:27.099
so you're kinda late.

56:27.132 --> 56:28.701
But it's the 11th.

56:28.733 --> 56:29.568
Yeah.

56:30.469 --> 56:31.237
Sorry.

56:54.259 --> 56:56.228
Ooh, fucking battery acid.

56:56.260 --> 56:58.197
We'll drink
champagne next week.

56:58.230 --> 57:00.166
There is
no next week, Josie.

57:03.268 --> 57:04.704
We're outta cash.

57:04.737 --> 57:06.739
You're the one who
wanted to come here, Jack.

57:19.083 --> 57:20.552
Just say it.

57:20.585 --> 57:21.586
I just want you

57:21.619 --> 57:22.887
to fucking say it, okay?

57:22.920 --> 57:24.422
I ruined your life, didn't I?

57:24.456 --> 57:26.659
You were happy as a
little princess with Daddy

57:26.692 --> 57:27.860
and then I waltzed right in

57:27.893 --> 57:30.596
and now you're
living in squalor.

57:30.628 --> 57:31.463
Hmm?

57:36.768 --> 57:38.870
You fucking prima donna.

57:38.903 --> 57:40.039
You prima donna, you fucking...

57:44.777 --> 57:45.610
Fuck.

58:02.126 --> 58:06.132
Write happy birthday,
Josie, from Becka.

58:07.298 --> 58:09.434
I don't think
this is gonna work.

58:09.467 --> 58:11.136
You got a better idea?

58:22.181 --> 58:23.615
Okay, good.

58:23.648 --> 58:25.116
Keep back a little so it doesn't
look like we're together.

58:37.596 --> 58:38.998
Next.

58:42.501 --> 58:46.605
Next.

58:48.507 --> 58:50.809
All right.

58:53.478 --> 58:54.313
Next.

58:55.380 --> 58:56.615
Just this.

58:56.648 --> 58:57.450
2.50.

59:00.786 --> 59:01.787
Next.

59:01.820 --> 59:03.122
I gave you a 50.

59:03.155 --> 59:03.956
It was a five.

59:03.989 --> 59:05.456
No, I gave you a 50.

59:05.489 --> 59:06.758
It was a five, miss.

59:06.791 --> 59:09.360
You put it underneath
your register.

59:09.393 --> 59:13.498
It has a birthday message
from my aunt in purple ink.

59:13.532 --> 59:14.367
Shit.

59:16.534 --> 59:17.469
Sorry about that.

59:17.501 --> 59:18.471
- Thank you.
- Next.

59:30.047 --> 59:31.216
Hmm?

59:40.057 --> 59:41.159
Rookie move.

59:46.063 --> 59:47.298
What?

59:47.331 --> 59:49.367
I saw the ink when you paid.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.202
You shouldn't have used purple.

59:51.235 --> 59:52.704
Too memorable.

59:52.737 --> 59:54.539
Just leave us alone, okay?

59:54.572 --> 59:55.407
Why should I?

59:56.742 --> 59:58.210
Be nice, Jo.

59:58.242 --> 01:00:01.212
Yeah, be nice, Jo.

01:00:01.246 --> 01:00:02.847
Jack, let's just go please.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.714
Jack.

01:00:06.784 --> 01:00:07.619
I'm Lily.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.425
My friend lives right up here.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.594
His parties are amazing.

01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:18.898
You'll just die when
you see his place.

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:20.065
Will I?

01:00:20.097 --> 01:00:21.333
Will I just die?

01:00:21.365 --> 01:00:23.501
I'll have
him buzz us up.

01:00:23.534 --> 01:00:24.569
Maybe you could
be a little bit less

01:00:24.603 --> 01:00:26.171
of a hostile bitch, huh?

01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:27.606
Maybe I should just go home

01:00:27.639 --> 01:00:29.909
and let you guys seal this
whole deal without me.

01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:32.110
We're in.

01:00:32.978 --> 01:00:34.413
Let's go.

01:01:09.114 --> 01:01:10.816
Having a good time?

01:01:12.416 --> 01:01:13.485
Sure, yeah, whatever

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:15.887
Oh good.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.156
"Sure whatever" is exactly
the reaction I look for

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.258
when I throw a party.

01:01:20.525 --> 01:01:21.393
I'm Carmichael.

01:01:22.927 --> 01:01:23.795
Josie.

01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:25.797
So how do you know Lily?

01:01:27.498 --> 01:01:28.833
We met her earlier today.

01:01:29.867 --> 01:01:31.670
Yeah, she does that.

01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:32.672
Meets people.

01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:35.807
And just for my own
personal edification,

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.009
how did she meet you?

01:01:39.344 --> 01:01:42.181
My brother and I were
robbing a sandwich shop.

01:01:42.213 --> 01:01:43.014
Ah.

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:43.848
Your brother.

01:01:43.882 --> 01:01:44.983
That makes more sense.

01:01:46.184 --> 01:01:49.088
Maris,
she's his sister.

01:01:49.121 --> 01:01:51.155
Told you
Lily had it handled.

01:01:51.188 --> 01:01:53.960
That's what Lilys do
after all, handle things.

01:01:54.893 --> 01:01:56.494
What kind of things?

01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:57.695
Fabulous things.

01:01:57.728 --> 01:01:59.431
Like your brother.

01:02:07.304 --> 01:02:08.974
So what do you do?

01:02:10.342 --> 01:02:11.543
Nothing.

01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:17.215
You're one of us.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.898
Think I like her.

01:02:37.369 --> 01:02:38.202
Oh.

01:02:45.876 --> 01:02:48.246
Here, this is for dinner

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.548
and whatever else you may need.

01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:52.183
Where is all this
money coming from?

01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:54.920
Where do
you think, sister of mine?

01:02:58.356 --> 01:02:59.191
Don't wait up.

01:03:17.943 --> 01:03:19.078
Bullshit.

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.911
Bullshit.

01:03:20.878 --> 01:03:22.447
Oh, shit.

01:03:28.753 --> 01:03:30.289
Who is it?

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:31.323
It's Josie.

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:39.597
What's up?

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:42.033
Do you got a light bulb?

01:03:42.067 --> 01:03:42.902
Yeah.

01:03:44.268 --> 01:03:45.437
Yeah, come on.

01:03:49.141 --> 01:03:51.309
The wiring's all fucked up.

01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:54.445
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:54.478 --> 01:03:55.379
What?

01:03:55.413 --> 01:03:58.282
Uh, I shouldn't talk like that

01:03:58.315 --> 01:03:59.817
around a lady.

01:03:59.851 --> 01:04:01.720
At least that's what
my wife says anyway.

01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:03.422
No, it's fine.

01:04:03.454 --> 01:04:05.257
Don't worry about it.

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:07.492
So you live with your brother?

01:04:08.492 --> 01:04:09.728
That's nice.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.663
You know, staying
with family and all.

01:04:13.664 --> 01:04:15.467
He doesn't seem to
like me very much.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.302
He
doesn't like anybody.

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:21.307
Yeah, well, some
people are like that.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.348
What's going on?

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.982
The wiring's all messed up.

01:04:31.016 --> 01:04:32.483
Luis is helping.

01:04:32.516 --> 01:04:34.318
Oh, don't bother.

01:04:34.351 --> 01:04:35.253
We don't need it.

01:04:35.286 --> 01:04:36.020
Maybe you don't.

01:04:36.054 --> 01:04:37.489
You're never here.

01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:40.159
You know, I'll just
come back some other time.

01:04:41.525 --> 01:04:44.096
I left some things in
my tool box anyway.

01:04:44.128 --> 01:04:45.230
Thank you so much.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.199
Not a problem at all.

01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:56.175
God, you're such
an asshole sometimes.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.410
You know you're lucky
I came in when I did.

01:04:59.878 --> 01:05:01.013
What, you think he
was just helping

01:05:01.045 --> 01:05:02.280
out of the kindness
of his heart?

01:05:02.313 --> 01:05:03.114
Yeah, he's the super.

01:05:03.148 --> 01:05:04.016
It's his job, Jack.

01:05:04.048 --> 01:05:05.884
Oh, you're so naive.

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:08.554
Why do I even...

01:05:14.226 --> 01:05:16.228
Look, it doesn't matter.

01:05:17.262 --> 01:05:19.331
It really doesn't matter.

01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:20.231
We're outta here.

01:05:21.398 --> 01:05:22.567
How?

01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:23.802
We're moving in with Lily.

01:05:23.835 --> 01:05:25.237
Christ, Josie.

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.273
What do you think I've been
doing this entire time?

01:05:29.407 --> 01:05:31.043
I told Lily we couldn't
afford our place

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:33.844
and she jumped right on it.

01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:35.480
She said, "Move
in here, darling."

01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:39.884
So I said, "I don't go
anywhere without my sister."

01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:42.153
She said she feels
sorry for you.

01:05:42.186 --> 01:05:43.154
She's a liar.

01:05:43.188 --> 01:05:44.556
I'm sure she is.

01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:45.757
Who cares.

01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:47.558
She's got a two-bedroom
on the Upper West Side

01:05:47.592 --> 01:05:50.662
and the rent comes straight
out of her trust fund.

01:05:51.896 --> 01:05:52.764
You think I can
keep her on the line

01:05:52.797 --> 01:05:53.898
until we get tired of her?

01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:55.833
She's so high half the time

01:05:55.867 --> 01:05:58.903
she doesn't know whether
she's coming or going.

01:05:58.936 --> 01:05:59.871
Or coming.

01:06:01.239 --> 01:06:02.942
You sound like me.

01:06:10.748 --> 01:06:11.916
Jack.

01:06:11.949 --> 01:06:14.619
Come here, come
here, come here.

01:06:15.653 --> 01:06:16.655
Smaller sister.

01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:18.956
This is it.

01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:20.558
Okay?

01:06:20.592 --> 01:06:22.126
This is our chance.

01:06:45.282 --> 01:06:46.150
It's beautiful.

01:06:47.952 --> 01:06:49.121
I like the flowers.

01:06:49.153 --> 01:06:51.056
Lilies obviously.

01:06:51.088 --> 01:06:53.157
My florist delivers
them every week.

01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:56.828
Santa Barbara, Madonna,
science fiction.

01:06:57.795 --> 01:07:00.931
These are my favorites.

01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:02.300
Lilies of the valley.

01:07:03.768 --> 01:07:06.137
When I was a kid I had a cat
that died from eating them.

01:07:07.172 --> 01:07:08.173
So sad.

01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:15.981
This will be like our
own little slumber party.

01:07:19.016 --> 01:07:22.086
I bet you've never even been
to a slumber party, have you?

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:24.322
And Jack told me all
about how your dad

01:07:24.356 --> 01:07:26.825
kept you locked up in
that crazy old house

01:07:26.858 --> 01:07:28.360
all by yourself.

01:07:28.393 --> 01:07:31.295
So "Flowers in the Attic".

01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:34.298
Really.

01:07:34.331 --> 01:07:36.600
It's a wonder you two turned
out as normal as you did.

01:07:36.634 --> 01:07:40.005
Oh, we're
not that normal.

01:07:40.038 --> 01:07:43.442
Well, forgive me if
I hold out a shred of hope

01:07:43.474 --> 01:07:44.710
for your sister.

01:07:45.577 --> 01:07:47.145
Her?

01:07:47.177 --> 01:07:49.347
She's the sick one.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.648
Way worse than me.

01:08:00.858 --> 01:08:02.393
Beloved sister.

01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:06.398
Did you sleep well?

01:08:08.233 --> 01:08:10.335
Is your brother not brilliant?

01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:12.703
Are you not blissfully happy?

01:08:12.737 --> 01:08:13.872
Blissfully.

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.307
Good.

01:08:16.573 --> 01:08:18.210
Lily gets home at seven.

01:08:18.243 --> 01:08:19.644
We're all going out.

01:08:19.676 --> 01:08:21.912
She said to borrow
something from her closet.

01:08:23.715 --> 01:08:24.550
Okay.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.694
Sorry.

01:08:36.728 --> 01:08:38.162
You're home early.

01:08:38.194 --> 01:08:39.729
Jack said that I could
borrow something to wear.

01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:41.899
Yeah, it's fine, of course.

01:08:43.067 --> 01:08:44.737
I just had to get
out of that office.

01:08:46.104 --> 01:08:47.072
My dad's on the board.

01:08:47.104 --> 01:08:48.906
What are they gonna do, fire me?

01:08:50.742 --> 01:08:54.578
You look great.

01:08:54.612 --> 01:08:56.247
When in doubt wear black.

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:01.153
What can we do about
that hair though?

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:09.460
You have great hair

01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:13.732
if you knew what to do with it.

01:09:25.844 --> 01:09:27.645
And here.

01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:41.658
Can I get dressed now?

01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.127
Yeah, thank you.

01:09:56.707 --> 01:09:58.275
Well, well.

01:09:58.309 --> 01:09:59.778
You look as good
as your brother.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:02.680
Guess Lily found her newest
bit of window dressing.

01:10:02.713 --> 01:10:03.948
Window dressing?

01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:05.484
Take advantage of
it while you can.

01:10:05.516 --> 01:10:06.818
She'll drop you
when she gets bored

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.152
like she always does.

01:10:08.185 --> 01:10:09.787
Oh, for fuck sake, Maris.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.989
Stop acting like a
jilted girlfriend.

01:10:12.023 --> 01:10:13.824
It's so unattractive.

01:10:13.858 --> 01:10:15.025
I'm getting a drink.

01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:15.894
Please do.

01:10:18.195 --> 01:10:19.631
Don't mind her.

01:10:19.663 --> 01:10:22.434
She's always like this
when Lily gets a new toy.

01:10:24.668 --> 01:10:25.871
Want a drink?

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.712
How am I supposed to choose?

01:10:34.746 --> 01:10:37.215
I mean, look at you two.

01:10:37.247 --> 01:10:38.682
Honestly.

01:10:38.716 --> 01:10:42.320
Well, one of us
is your sister.

01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:45.323
Mmm.

01:10:46.224 --> 01:10:47.192
Mmm.

01:11:10.381 --> 01:11:11.517
Mmm mmm mmm.

01:11:15.252 --> 01:11:17.988
You out to
lunch with her again?

01:11:18.021 --> 01:11:20.192
Just some old friend
from boarding school.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.929
You know what you
are to her, right?

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.666
The answer to
her wildest fantasies.

01:11:27.698 --> 01:11:29.233
A new toy,

01:11:29.266 --> 01:11:31.936
a pet, the new piece
of window dressing.

01:11:33.604 --> 01:11:35.439
Ah, let her think
what she wants.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:38.644
She's on my hook, not
the other way around.

01:11:43.213 --> 01:11:44.082
You better get going.

01:11:44.114 --> 01:11:44.949
She's waiting.

01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:06.471
Hi.

01:12:06.503 --> 01:12:08.273
God, Lily, what's on your arm?

01:12:10.307 --> 01:12:11.143
Nothing.

01:14:24.609 --> 01:14:25.710
I'm hungry, Jack.

01:14:25.743 --> 01:14:26.911
Can we just...

01:14:26.944 --> 01:14:28.413
No, we're
going out, just wait.

01:14:32.449 --> 01:14:33.617
Well, I could just
make us sandwiches...

01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:35.420
Goddamn it, Josie.

01:14:35.453 --> 01:14:36.321
I told you.

01:14:39.289 --> 01:14:40.625
She'll be home any minute.

01:14:41.458 --> 01:14:42.327
Just wait.

01:14:43.461 --> 01:14:45.396
She is two hours late.

01:14:45.429 --> 01:14:47.731
She got held up at work.

01:14:47.765 --> 01:14:49.234
Yeah, she's famous
for her work ethic.

01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:52.770
Sorry I'm so late.

01:14:52.804 --> 01:14:54.439
Maris and I went to
grab a quick drink

01:14:54.471 --> 01:14:57.108
and then it was like
whoa, look at the time.

01:14:58.074 --> 01:14:59.077
No problem.

01:14:59.109 --> 01:15:01.779
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:15:01.813 --> 01:15:03.381
You smell like beer.

01:15:03.413 --> 01:15:04.948
I hate the smell of beer.

01:15:04.981 --> 01:15:09.988
I brought Thai food.

01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:14.792
I've been meaning to tell you

01:15:14.826 --> 01:15:17.628
I'm heading down to St.
Barts for the long weekend.

01:15:18.796 --> 01:15:19.664
Okay.

01:15:19.697 --> 01:15:20.632
If I don't get out of the city

01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:22.634
every few months, I go nuts.

01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:25.203
But you guys can take
care of everything, right?

01:15:26.037 --> 01:15:27.505
Like it was our own.

01:15:27.537 --> 01:15:28.706
Except it's not.

01:15:30.341 --> 01:15:31.176
Anyway.

01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:34.845
Carmichael is having
a party tomorrow.

01:15:36.012 --> 01:15:38.115
I thought it'd be
fun before I leave.

01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:39.684
Yeah.

01:15:39.716 --> 01:15:41.353
That's probably him right now.

01:15:49.527 --> 01:15:50.328
Hi.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.328
You okay?

01:15:53.463 --> 01:15:54.899
She was supposed
to take me with her

01:15:56.033 --> 01:15:59.237
to St. Barts.

01:16:01.305 --> 01:16:03.341
Maybe she changed her mind.

01:16:29.734 --> 01:16:30.569
Fuck off!

01:16:32.603 --> 01:16:34.305
I want you to stick close
to me tonight, okay?

01:16:34.337 --> 01:16:35.340
Stay where I can see you.

01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:36.240
I don't trust these people.

01:16:36.274 --> 01:16:37.375
Stay where you can see me?

01:16:37.408 --> 01:16:38.576
Why don't you stay

01:16:38.609 --> 01:16:39.377
- where I can see you?
- Well, don't be a bitch

01:16:39.409 --> 01:16:40.211
right now, Josie.

01:16:40.243 --> 01:16:40.744
I'm not in the mood.

01:16:41.612 --> 01:16:42.547
You know what?

01:16:42.579 --> 01:16:44.416
Fuck you, fuck you very much.

01:16:48.452 --> 01:16:50.521
You look
disappointingly sober.

01:16:50.554 --> 01:16:51.355
I am.

01:16:51.389 --> 01:16:52.190
Here.

01:16:53.123 --> 01:16:55.225
Jo, meet Joe.

01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:56.594
Greetings.

01:16:56.627 --> 01:17:01.633
Hi.

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:08.072
So what I hear is that you're

01:17:08.104 --> 01:17:10.574
Lily Carter's new protege, huh?

01:17:10.608 --> 01:17:12.110
I, no, I just stay with her.

01:17:13.577 --> 01:17:16.081
She's, you know, whatever
she is with my brother.

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:18.849
I see, and what are you?

01:17:18.882 --> 01:17:19.783
She's seventeen.

01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:22.519
Is that so?

01:17:22.552 --> 01:17:24.055
Yeah.

01:17:24.087 --> 01:17:28.393
Well, then lets get you
another one of those, huh?

01:17:39.636 --> 01:17:40.804
Where are we?

01:17:40.837 --> 01:17:42.639
Joe's place.

01:17:42.672 --> 01:17:43.474
You drank too much.

01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:44.408
You need to lie down.

01:17:48.813 --> 01:17:50.015
Oh God, Jack.

01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:52.149
Shh shh shh shh.

01:17:52.182 --> 01:17:55.953
Jack said it's okay.

01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:57.454
Jack.

01:17:57.488 --> 01:17:58.490
Shh.

01:18:08.865 --> 01:18:09.801
Jack?

01:18:14.137 --> 01:18:14.972
Jack.

01:18:40.197 --> 01:18:41.199
Where's the bathroom?

01:18:42.565 --> 01:18:43.400
To the left.

01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:05.323
That's Ingrid.

01:19:05.355 --> 01:19:06.623
That's my ferret.

01:19:06.657 --> 01:19:07.592
You wanna hold her?

01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:09.527
- No, I'm fine.
- Come on, come on.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.361
No, she's cool.

01:19:10.394 --> 01:19:11.462
She's super sweet.

01:19:11.494 --> 01:19:12.296
You'll like her.

01:19:12.328 --> 01:19:13.197
Come here, baby.

01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:14.264
Mornin', mornin'.

01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:17.201
Here, here, just hold
her for a second.

01:19:17.234 --> 01:19:18.403
No, I'm fine.

01:19:18.435 --> 01:19:19.369
Ah!

01:19:19.403 --> 01:19:20.338
- Ow, ow, ah!
- No, no don't.

01:19:20.371 --> 01:19:21.204
No, no, you're freaking out.

01:19:21.238 --> 01:19:22.407
Ah ah ah.

01:19:22.439 --> 01:19:23.373
Don't freak out,
don't freak out.

01:19:23.407 --> 01:19:24.976
You're gonna fucking hurt her!

01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:26.743
You fucking hurt her.

01:19:27.778 --> 01:19:29.012
Goddamn it.

01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:30.181
Get the fuck outta
here, all right?

01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:31.582
Just get the fuck out.

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:35.053
It's all right,
baby, it's all right.

01:19:35.086 --> 01:19:35.887
You're okay.

01:20:09.319 --> 01:20:10.654
You're back.

01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:17.461
We tried to find
you before you left.

01:20:19.462 --> 01:20:21.565
Lily said you went
off with Carmichael.

01:20:25.502 --> 01:20:26.737
I just wanna take a bath.

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:28.273
Can you leave me alone please?

01:20:30.274 --> 01:20:31.109
Did you?

01:20:32.143 --> 01:20:33.778
Go off with Carmichael?

01:20:36.346 --> 01:20:37.748
I just wanna take a bath.

01:20:45.488 --> 01:20:47.291
What
happened to your hand?

01:20:51.295 --> 01:20:53.530
Same thing that happened
to the rest of me.

01:21:02.672 --> 01:21:04.474
I told you.

01:21:04.507 --> 01:21:06.476
I told you not to
leave my sight.

01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:15.185
Lily told me she loved me.

01:21:17.154 --> 01:21:18.356
Do you believe that shit?

01:21:20.457 --> 01:21:21.226
No.

01:21:23.327 --> 01:21:24.128
Me neither.

01:21:30.367 --> 01:21:32.369
You're the only one
that's ever loved me.

01:21:33.636 --> 01:21:35.739
And I'm the only one
that's ever loved you.

01:21:37.707 --> 01:21:39.710
That's all there is.

01:21:39.743 --> 01:21:41.079
That's all that matters.

01:21:54.057 --> 01:21:55.859
I wanna
leave New York.

01:21:55.893 --> 01:21:57.494
Leave?

01:21:57.528 --> 01:21:58.363
Why?

01:21:59.563 --> 01:22:00.730
You really wanna give up
everything we worked for

01:22:00.764 --> 01:22:02.266
just because of one bad night?

01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:07.171
Did you talk to Joe
and Carmichael last night?

01:22:07.203 --> 01:22:09.039
Did you say anything to 'em?

01:22:09.073 --> 01:22:10.508
No, I never even met Joe.

01:22:12.275 --> 01:22:14.177
Look, I get it was a bad night.

01:22:14.211 --> 01:22:15.547
But you act like...

01:22:16.947 --> 01:22:19.250
I mean, it's not like
you never had sex before.

01:22:21.085 --> 01:22:22.319
Just forget about it.

01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:23.554
Put it out of your mind.

01:22:23.587 --> 01:22:26.257
It sucked, it's over, move on.

01:22:39.936 --> 01:22:40.904
Josie!

01:22:42.038 --> 01:22:42.873
Come here.

01:22:46.143 --> 01:22:47.578
There you are.

01:22:50.713 --> 01:22:53.050
Where have you
been, sleepy head?

01:22:53.082 --> 01:22:53.951
Nowhere.

01:22:55.786 --> 01:22:57.555
I was wondering
when you'd be up.

01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:00.457
Josie, come here.

01:23:01.292 --> 01:23:02.160
Let me see you.

01:23:08.465 --> 01:23:09.533
What's this?

01:23:09.565 --> 01:23:11.301
I just cut it on a can.

01:23:11.335 --> 01:23:13.069
It was stupid.

01:23:13.103 --> 01:23:14.971
Well, it looks infected.

01:23:15.005 --> 01:23:17.108
You should see a doctor.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.542
Josie's fine,
aren't you, Josie?

01:23:19.576 --> 01:23:20.409
Yeah.

01:23:21.578 --> 01:23:22.947
There's a first aid
kit in my bathroom.

01:23:22.979 --> 01:23:24.114
Would you get it, Jack?

01:23:32.855 --> 01:23:33.824
And the bruises?

01:23:37.094 --> 01:23:38.128
Did Jack do it?

01:23:39.796 --> 01:23:41.164
No.

01:23:41.198 --> 01:23:43.000
Look, I know what
he can be like.

01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:46.271
Okay, I know how he can get.

01:23:47.537 --> 01:23:48.338
Yeah, but unlike you,

01:23:48.372 --> 01:23:49.340
I don't get off on it.

01:23:52.676 --> 01:23:54.345
You're smarter
than that, Josie.

01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:12.864
You got your wish.

01:24:16.399 --> 01:24:17.234
Hmm?

01:24:19.403 --> 01:24:20.538
Why, what's happening?

01:24:22.872 --> 01:24:25.309
She said she
decided when she was away.

01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:28.046
Wants us out by Friday.

01:24:33.417 --> 01:24:35.219
You always hated
her, didn't you?

01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:41.725
I always hated her too.

01:24:44.694 --> 01:24:45.996
From the moment I saw her.

01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:00.078
I have a treat.

01:25:01.712 --> 01:25:04.081
If we don't all set off
with hangovers tomorrow,

01:25:04.113 --> 01:25:05.882
I'll consider my life a failure.

01:25:07.917 --> 01:25:09.886
What should we drink to?

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.755
You tell me.

01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:14.091
To the future.

01:25:22.466 --> 01:25:25.703
And then the cab
driver charged me

01:25:25.735 --> 01:25:28.072
some absurd amount of money

01:25:28.104 --> 01:25:29.639
and she paid for it.

01:25:32.609 --> 01:25:34.545
I mean, the girl's
a complete disaster.

01:25:34.578 --> 01:25:35.446
- She even...
- Would you two

01:25:35.479 --> 01:25:37.081
shut the fuck up?

01:25:39.783 --> 01:25:42.753
So very grouchy.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.956
I said shut the fuck up!

01:25:55.765 --> 01:25:56.933
Fuck you both.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.570
Oh, darling, you already have.

01:26:09.813 --> 01:26:10.981
I'm right, aren't I?

01:26:12.483 --> 01:26:15.653
Oh, I knew it.

01:26:16.787 --> 01:26:18.122
I knew it!

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:22.827
Carmichael had his suspicions

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:25.563
and I mean, I knew,
of course I knew,

01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:27.297
but I didn't know!

01:26:31.502 --> 01:26:34.005
Ooh, I'm, I'm not judging.

01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:37.307
It's kind of romantic.

01:26:37.341 --> 01:26:39.109
I mean, maybe a little sick,

01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:42.479
but who isn't
a little sick sometimes?

01:26:45.615 --> 01:26:48.953
Were you kids when you started?

01:26:48.985 --> 01:26:50.854
Oh my God.

01:26:50.887 --> 01:26:53.256
It's like one of
those British novels

01:26:53.289 --> 01:26:56.359
and the kids are always
fucking each other.

01:28:16.038 --> 01:28:19.109
I think I need to
go to the doctor.

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.454
Lily Carter?

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:37.962
Let's get you comfortable.

01:28:39.595 --> 01:28:42.432
Hey, I gotta go and take
care of some things, okay?

01:28:42.466 --> 01:28:43.701
I'll be by later.

01:28:43.734 --> 01:28:44.535
Go to sleep.

01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:52.275
Dr. Gable, Dr. Gable.

01:28:52.309 --> 01:28:54.278
Chris Corda, 6-3-1-9.

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:56.947
Chris Corda, 6-3-1-9.

01:28:56.979 --> 01:28:58.047
Dr. Hinkle.

01:29:09.659 --> 01:29:11.060
We have to take the bus.

01:29:11.094 --> 01:29:12.229
Every other way leaves a trail.

01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:13.997
I don't wanna leave
a trail, okay?

01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.832
We gotta slip away.

01:29:14.864 --> 01:29:16.166
What do you think?

01:29:17.634 --> 01:29:18.836
Have you been taking
too many of Lily's pills?

01:29:18.868 --> 01:29:21.137
No, no, no, no,
no, not too many.

01:29:21.171 --> 01:29:22.974
I just need to stay
awake and think.

01:29:24.173 --> 01:29:25.976
We're gonna get
away with it, Josie.

01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:29.113
We are.

01:29:29.145 --> 01:29:29.947
You and me.

01:29:33.716 --> 01:29:35.451
You and me.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.555
Okay.

01:29:38.988 --> 01:29:39.989
Okay, yeah, okay.

01:29:40.023 --> 01:29:41.192
Okay.

01:29:44.895 --> 01:29:46.630
Dr. Stanley Gilbert,

01:29:46.662 --> 01:29:48.498
please call Emergency.

01:29:56.707 --> 01:29:58.209
I see the florist came.

01:29:59.542 --> 01:30:01.978
Has the phone been
doing that a lot?

01:30:02.011 --> 01:30:03.014
Afraid so.

01:30:04.381 --> 01:30:06.651
I talked to your old
friend Carmichael.

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:09.719
I told him she headed
up to Maine last minute.

01:30:09.752 --> 01:30:11.988
And then I stopped answering it.

01:30:13.756 --> 01:30:16.393
Her parents left a
message on the machine.

01:30:17.426 --> 01:30:18.628
That's not good.

01:30:18.662 --> 01:30:19.829
Oh we'll, it's not bad.

01:30:19.863 --> 01:30:21.065
I mean, her parents
live in Florida.

01:30:21.097 --> 01:30:23.734
I mean, it'll be weeks
before they figure out

01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:25.001
she's not in Maine.

01:30:29.238 --> 01:30:30.573
I got some wine.

01:30:31.742 --> 01:30:34.344
I figured we'd go all
out, one last night

01:30:34.377 --> 01:30:37.248
before we hit the road.

01:30:38.414 --> 01:30:39.250
And then what?

01:30:40.417 --> 01:30:42.920
And then we find
some other Lily.

01:30:47.457 --> 01:30:48.292
You.

01:30:51.094 --> 01:30:52.262
You never trust me.

01:30:53.462 --> 01:30:55.465
We have this
conversation every time.

01:30:56.766 --> 01:30:57.934
You always have to know

01:30:57.967 --> 01:30:59.502
where we're going
and what we're doing.

01:30:59.536 --> 01:31:02.840
But haven't we always come
out all right in the end?

01:31:02.872 --> 01:31:04.107
We're not at the
end of this yet, Jack.

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:08.278
Smaller sister.

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:09.913
You're always so serious.

01:31:10.881 --> 01:31:12.416
We're free as birds.

01:31:12.448 --> 01:31:14.684
With Lily's ATM card
we have all the money

01:31:14.717 --> 01:31:16.854
we could possibly want.

01:31:16.886 --> 01:31:17.787
That ATM card

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.756
is traceable, Jack, okay?

01:31:19.789 --> 01:31:21.257
We might as well carry her body

01:31:21.291 --> 01:31:23.260
to the police station and
tell them what we did.

01:31:23.292 --> 01:31:24.494
Mmm hmm hmm hmm.

01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:28.666
All right, first of all,

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.669
it's not what we did.

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:34.772
It's what I did.

01:31:34.805 --> 01:31:36.173
And second of all,

01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:38.409
I did it for you.

01:31:40.911 --> 01:31:45.315
I told Lily, if she wanted to
watch me fuck another girl,

01:31:45.347 --> 01:31:47.984
I'd do it but not you.

01:31:51.253 --> 01:31:52.088
Why not?

01:31:56.259 --> 01:31:58.162
Because we belong
to each other in a way

01:31:58.194 --> 01:32:00.130
that nobody else
will ever understand

01:32:00.162 --> 01:32:02.632
and I refuse to share that.

01:32:02.666 --> 01:32:04.268
I refuse to share you.

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.670
Do you know how lucky we
are to have each other?

01:32:08.438 --> 01:32:09.806
We'll always be together.

01:32:10.841 --> 01:32:11.675
Always.

01:32:16.046 --> 01:32:18.649
Well then, I better
start cooking then.

01:32:18.681 --> 01:32:20.483
Why don't you go
turn on some music?

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.889
Coming right up.

01:32:40.502 --> 01:32:42.739
God, I hate all this white.

01:32:46.408 --> 01:32:47.610
When you and I
get our own place,

01:32:47.644 --> 01:32:49.847
let's not have any white
in it at all, okay?

01:32:50.881 --> 01:32:52.349
None.

01:32:52.381 --> 01:32:53.716
Not even white sheets.

01:34:23.806 --> 01:34:26.577
You still feeling bad?

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.582
Yeah.

01:34:57.707 --> 01:34:58.642
I'm sick.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:01.679
Oh, what's wrong?

01:35:02.845 --> 01:35:04.647
Everything.

01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:08.385
My heart is racing.

01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:13.190
Maybe you took too
many of Lily's pills.

01:35:15.324 --> 01:35:16.693
Food musta been bad.

01:35:19.695 --> 01:35:20.898
I can hardly see.

01:35:24.466 --> 01:35:26.903
Food poisoning will only
last till the morning.

01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:29.506
Hmm?

01:35:31.341 --> 01:35:33.677
You think I'll live?

01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:34.645
Doubtful.

01:35:46.555 --> 01:35:47.390
Josie.

01:35:55.398 --> 01:35:56.233
Hey.

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:07.243
When is Raeburn coming home?

01:36:09.179 --> 01:36:10.346
We're in New York, Jack.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.215
We're at Lily's.

01:36:14.417 --> 01:36:15.452
Is she here?

01:36:19.354 --> 01:36:20.189
Lily's dead.

01:36:25.295 --> 01:36:26.529
Josie.

01:36:26.563 --> 01:36:28.532
I'm here.

01:36:28.564 --> 01:36:29.732
Hey, I'm here.

01:36:36.439 --> 01:36:37.941
Knew it was you.

01:36:43.378 --> 01:36:44.213
Don't leave me.

01:36:45.715 --> 01:36:47.684
I won't.

01:36:47.716 --> 01:36:50.554
I won't.

01:37:05.734 --> 01:37:07.304
It's gonna be okay.

01:37:14.243 --> 01:37:15.813
We'll go somewhere new,

01:37:18.948 --> 01:37:20.150
just the two of us.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.856
Like a private island.

01:37:28.992 --> 01:37:30.594
And we'll be happy.

01:37:32.828 --> 01:37:33.764
You and me.

01:37:48.944 --> 01:37:49.846
I love you.

01:37:54.951 --> 01:37:56.686
I love you so much.

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:15.305
Hey.

01:38:16.672 --> 01:38:17.474
Oh, oh.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.515
Oh.
