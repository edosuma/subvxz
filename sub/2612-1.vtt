<i>♪ To get inside my mind
Is this what you wanted</i>

01:25.124 --> 01:29.493
<i>♪ Get me all turned around
Tell me baby</i>

01:40.439 --> 01:42.440
Hello?

03:20.915 --> 03:23.082
No! No!

04:56.384 --> 04:58.352
What's going on in there?

04:58.354 --> 05:02.422
John own memories are intruding.
He's having a seizure.

05:02.424 --> 05:05.592
Marjorie! Get in there! Now!

05:34.992 --> 05:37.861
<i>Senator Rockford has been
identified as the target...</i>

05:37.863 --> 05:41.064
<i>of an FBI investigation, involving
embezzlement and accusations of blackmail.</i>

05:41.066 --> 05:42.999
Senator!

05:43.001 --> 05:47.705
I whole heartedly and emphatically deny any
and all allegations leveled against me.

05:47.707 --> 05:50.775
<i>His attorney has secured the
services of Mindscape...</i>

05:50.777 --> 05:53.077
<i>the world's top memory
detective agency...</i>

05:53.079 --> 05:57.449
<i>to gather information about his past and
help the FBI with the investigation.</i>

05:57.451 --> 05:59.851
<i>Memory detectives, as
they're commonly known...</i>

05:59.853 --> 06:02.387
<i>have experienced a resurgence
in recent years...</i>

06:02.389 --> 06:06.625
<i>thanks to the growing number of cases
solved using the remote viewing technique.</i>

06:06.627 --> 06:10.029
<i>In the early 70 s, the
Defense Intelligence Agency</i>

06:10.031 --> 06:14.367
<i>began conducting top secret experiments
with people with psychic abilities</i>

06:14.369 --> 06:18.137
<i>to help gather intelligence
for modern warfare.</i>

06:18.139 --> 06:20.506
<i>They came across a
group of ESP's...</i>

06:20.508 --> 06:22.910
<i>that had the ability to
access people's memories</i>

06:22.912 --> 06:27.414
<i>and observe them as they were experienced
in the past by the subjects.</i>

06:29.751 --> 06:33.053
<i>The findings of memory detectives do
not yet carry the same weight...</i>

06:33.055 --> 06:34.623
<i>as DNA evidence in court...</i>

06:34.625 --> 06:38.226
<i>but currently prove more
reliable than polygraph tests.</i>

06:38.228 --> 06:41.463
<i>They say, remote viewing is nothing
more than an elaborate scam...</i>

06:41.465 --> 06:44.966
<i>but the reality is, remote viewers
have been solving cases...</i>

06:44.968 --> 06:46.969
<i>that have been cold for years.</i>

06:46.971 --> 06:50.206
<i>Most recently, the murder of
child actress Kate Henderson...</i>

06:50.208 --> 06:52.341
<i>was solved by memory
detective John Washington.</i>

06:55.445 --> 06:57.279
Shit.

07:02.787 --> 07:04.254
Hello?

07:04.256 --> 07:05.622
- <i>Ah, hello!</i>
- <i>Good Morning!</i>

07:05.624 --> 07:07.524
I'm calling about
the house for sale.

07:07.526 --> 07:11.929
No... no... we're not selling
the house anymore, I'm sorry.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.799
Well... the agency listing says
it's still active.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.902
Yeah, I know it's still listed at the
agency, but we're not selling it, okay?

07:17.904 --> 07:19.737
Mr. Washington's own
traumatic memories...

07:19.739 --> 07:21.673
<i>were blending in with
his clients memories...</i>

07:21.675 --> 07:22.974
<i>which impaired his ability
to focus during sessions.</i>

07:22.976 --> 07:25.144
And thank you.

07:25.146 --> 07:29.448
<i>Now it seems, Senator Rockford is betting
his political career on Mindscape...</i>

07:29.450 --> 07:34.119
<i>the prime memory detective
agency in the world.</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:39.659
<i>The rumors that the Mindscape program
is dangerous, are unfounded.</i>

07:58.380 --> 07:59.880
John is here.

07:59.882 --> 08:04.086
John... how are you?

08:04.088 --> 08:06.521
I'm great.

08:06.523 --> 08:08.190
You're still taking the medication?

08:08.192 --> 08:09.558
No, I'm done with all that.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.394
Well, you're lucky
the stroke was mild.

08:12.396 --> 08:15.832
You could be relearning
your abc's right now.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.735
That's true.

08:18.737 --> 08:19.969
Yes?

08:19.971 --> 08:22.972
Uh... I'm good.

08:22.974 --> 08:25.041
Nice.

08:28.379 --> 08:31.448
You met anybody recently?

08:31.450 --> 08:34.451
You know, John, maybe it's time
to get back in the running.

08:34.453 --> 08:35.986
I'm not there yet.

08:35.988 --> 08:37.321
It's been two years.

08:37.323 --> 08:39.691
You should move on from
what happened to your wife.

08:41.494 --> 08:43.828
And you know it wasn't your fault.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.363
Yeah, well...

08:45.365 --> 08:48.199
Oh, shit! Shit! Sorry.

08:48.201 --> 08:50.201
Ah, don't worry about it.
Don't worry!

08:50.203 --> 08:51.771
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry about it.

08:51.773 --> 08:53.405
I'm sorry.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.776
Here... sit down!
Sorry.

08:56.778 --> 08:59.178
I heard Senator Rockford on... TV...

08:59.180 --> 09:02.815
talking about the possibility
of hiring a memory detective.

09:02.817 --> 09:07.220
Oh, yeah, yeah. Peter Lundgren
is already working on the case.

09:07.222 --> 09:09.623
Rockford hired him.
Lundgren?

09:09.625 --> 09:12.826
C'mon! I was better than him
on my worst day!

09:12.828 --> 09:15.428
Yeah, but gifts like
yours need to be used.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.998
You've been out of
the game for months.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.401
And Lundgrens' success nowadays
is close to 100 percent.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.740
What's the matter?

09:29.913 --> 09:32.581
To be honest, I'm
running out of money.

09:34.450 --> 09:37.119
You still have the beach house?

09:37.121 --> 09:38.220
Yeah.

09:38.222 --> 09:39.555
Go ahead. Sell it.

09:39.557 --> 09:44.027
I'm not ready to sell it yet.

09:44.029 --> 09:47.964
What I was wondering was whether I
could do something for Mindscape.

09:47.966 --> 09:51.668
As it happens, I, uh...

09:51.670 --> 09:55.005
I might have something you're
right for, perfect actually.

09:55.007 --> 09:58.275
Her name is Anna.

09:58.277 --> 10:01.245
Oh, you're kidding.

10:01.247 --> 10:04.849
Forget about the name, right?

10:04.851 --> 10:08.186
She used to be my patient
when she was little.

10:08.188 --> 10:10.155
Very special girl...

10:10.157 --> 10:14.426
she's a teenager now, but I don't
think a... a doctor can help.

10:14.428 --> 10:16.428
Maybe a viewer can.

10:16.430 --> 10:18.096
Well, what's her problem?

10:18.098 --> 10:21.767
She's on a hunger strike.
All you have to do is get her to eat.

10:21.769 --> 10:24.370
Just tell the parents to
hide the fashion magazines.

10:24.372 --> 10:28.074
John...

10:28.076 --> 10:32.145
You know, it could be a quick one for you,
if you didn't wanna sell the beach house.

10:49.199 --> 10:52.634
<i>Hi John, I'm so happy
you're back in the saddle.</i>

10:52.636 --> 10:55.737
<i>Anna's still refusing to eat,
trying to pressure them...</i>

10:55.739 --> 10:57.840
into letting her out of the house.

10:57.842 --> 11:01.944
She's very fragile,
so tread carefully.

11:01.946 --> 11:06.515
<i>Try to find a trauma for her</i>
<i>therapist to work on... bye.</i>

12:20.696 --> 12:23.765
Thank you so much for
working on Anna's case.

12:23.767 --> 12:26.002
I'm Michelle.
John.

12:26.004 --> 12:29.505
And this is Anna's
stepfather, Robert.

12:29.507 --> 12:32.208
Sebastian speaks
very highly of you.

12:34.578 --> 12:37.614
Even as a baby, Anna was unusual.

12:37.616 --> 12:41.918
She didn't smile when you smiled at
her, but she didn't cry much, either.

12:41.920 --> 12:47.090
I would say she was unusually
focused for a child, always calm.

12:47.092 --> 12:50.428
She looked at things as if she
already knew what they were.

12:50.430 --> 12:56.401
Later, of course, we took her to a specialist,
and her IQ score came back off the charts.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.636
When was the last time she ate?

12:58.638 --> 13:00.405
She stopped eating one week ago.

13:00.407 --> 13:04.543
She's taking vitamins and
drinking water, but nothing else.

13:04.545 --> 13:09.882
In my opinion, she should be... in a
place that can provide the proper care.

13:09.884 --> 13:13.052
I'm sure Anna can get better here.

13:13.054 --> 13:15.922
Mr. Washington, ah... as I'm
sure you can appreciate...

13:15.924 --> 13:18.558
this is a matter that
requires great discretion.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.860
I will need you to sign a
non-disclosure contract...

13:20.862 --> 13:25.999
that anything revealed in Anna's memories can't
be disseminated beyond Michelle and myself.

13:26.001 --> 13:27.334
Of course.

13:27.336 --> 13:32.039
Anna is so special, she's
so many talents, she's...

13:34.276 --> 13:36.077
Gifted.

13:36.079 --> 13:38.012
Yes, gifted.

13:39.615 --> 13:41.983
I think there are
better words for it.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.052
Such as?

13:44.054 --> 13:46.688
I would say haunted.

13:51.862 --> 13:54.497
What happened to
Anna's real father?

13:54.499 --> 13:57.366
He died... when I was pregnant.

13:57.368 --> 13:58.468
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.436
Does Anna get along with Robert?

14:00.438 --> 14:04.541
Not well, lately... but he's
tried to do his best for her.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.411
I see.
This way.

14:07.413 --> 14:11.415
Is there any specific reason
why Anna is refusing to eat?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.851
She wants to go back to school,
but that's impossible.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.122
I'm sure Sebastian told you
about her cutting herself.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.191
We've had to remove all sharp
objects from her room.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.193
We need to protect her.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.463
From what?

14:25.465 --> 14:28.266
To protect her, from herself.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.923
Sweetie. This is John...

14:49.925 --> 14:52.559
the gentleman I told you
was coming to visit.

14:52.561 --> 14:55.396
Aren't you late for
your AA meeting, Mom?

15:12.515 --> 15:14.383
Can I have a seat?
Can I have a seat?

15:17.420 --> 15:19.656
Do you mind?
Do you mind?

15:19.658 --> 15:23.893
We won't guess the next one for sure,
so go ahead, make yourself comfortable.

15:27.831 --> 15:30.500
That's quite the party
trick you have there.

15:45.318 --> 15:48.286
What's the metronome for?

15:48.288 --> 15:51.456
I like the rhythm when I draw.
It's soothing.

15:58.432 --> 16:00.099
Better?

16:00.101 --> 16:01.467
Much.

16:05.772 --> 16:08.842
Anna, you know what catabolysis is?

16:08.844 --> 16:11.044
If you don't eat, your
organs are gonna fail.

16:11.046 --> 16:13.714
John, do you know what "prana" is?

16:13.716 --> 16:16.917
It's sanskrit, it means vital life.

16:16.919 --> 16:19.119
There are Yogis in
India who rarely eat.

16:19.121 --> 16:22.624
They get all their energy or
"prana" from the air and the sun.

16:22.626 --> 16:24.459
Is that what you're doing?

16:24.461 --> 16:25.827
Are you a doctor?

16:25.829 --> 16:28.496
No, but I do have to ask
you some questions.

16:33.903 --> 16:39.308
I would like you to tell me
what expression you see.

16:39.310 --> 16:44.280
What am I getting in exchange for
making you earn some of Robert's money?

16:44.282 --> 16:47.384
Well, you might get to
know yourself better.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.391
What do you see?

16:58.129 --> 17:00.531
Malice.

17:03.869 --> 17:06.270
I'm kidding.

17:06.271 --> 17:08.973
He's expressing happiness,
maybe even affection.

17:11.743 --> 17:13.578
What about this guy?

17:15.548 --> 17:17.683
That guy's pissed off.

17:17.685 --> 17:19.483
Uh-huh.

17:21.587 --> 17:24.057
What about her?

17:27.194 --> 17:29.996
I think her husband's out late,
and she's wondering where he is.

17:29.998 --> 17:33.833
She's worried he's with someone else, but
she's also glad to have the down time...

17:33.835 --> 17:36.002
'cause he's a loser.

17:40.575 --> 17:42.409
Right.

17:43.945 --> 17:46.347
I'm gonna tell you a story...

17:46.349 --> 17:50.218
and then I'm gonna ask you
a question. Okay?

17:52.555 --> 17:56.124
There's this girl about your
age at her mother's funeral.

17:56.126 --> 18:00.428
At the funeral, she sees this
guy she's never seen before.

18:00.430 --> 18:02.331
She gets to meet him, briefly.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.935
And she thinks he's amazing.
He's everything she's ever wanted.

18:05.937 --> 18:08.971
She falls in love with
him, right there and then.

18:08.973 --> 18:12.341
But, in the crowds at the
funeral, she gets separated...

18:12.343 --> 18:17.080
from him before she has a
chance to ask for his number.

18:17.082 --> 18:21.451
And two days later... this
girl... kills her own sister.

18:23.254 --> 18:26.089
What's her motive for
killing her sister?

18:30.529 --> 18:33.965
Her motive is she wants
to meet the guy again.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.272
Did I get it right?

18:40.274 --> 18:44.410
Oh, there's no right answer.

18:47.046 --> 18:49.481
Depends on what you're looking for.

18:49.483 --> 18:51.283
Why is that?

18:51.285 --> 18:55.522
You're testing me to see if
I think like a sociopath.

18:55.524 --> 18:58.758
Sociopaths sometimes have trouble
reading facial expressions.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.028
With the second test, I gave you
the answer you were looking for...

19:02.030 --> 19:04.765
but, the fact is, that
story has a flawed set up.

19:04.767 --> 19:07.701
The more logical outcome would be
for the girl to kill her father.

19:09.471 --> 19:12.373
Why?

19:12.375 --> 19:15.609
If the girl didn't know the man,
it's unlikely her sister would.

19:15.611 --> 19:19.147
And it was her mother's funeral
where she met this guy...

19:19.149 --> 19:20.849
so it would make more sense
for her to kill her father.

19:20.851 --> 19:23.685
There would be a higher
probability that the...

19:23.687 --> 19:27.355
the mystery stud would
attend her father's funeral.

19:30.093 --> 19:32.395
That's probably true.

19:32.397 --> 19:35.765
I'm not a sociopath, just smart
enough to think like one.

19:42.106 --> 19:44.475
Can I see what you're drawing?

19:54.854 --> 19:58.356
If you're not a doctor,
then what are you?

19:58.358 --> 20:02.227
I take people to their memories.

20:11.771 --> 20:13.339
She's monitored all the time?

20:13.341 --> 20:15.608
24-7.

20:15.610 --> 20:19.813
If you need anything while you're here, you
can ask me or Ralph, we both watch Anna.

20:19.815 --> 20:21.114
I'm John.

20:21.116 --> 20:24.384
Oh, I'm Judith... this is my cell.

20:24.386 --> 20:27.721
Call me, if you can't
make a session.

20:27.723 --> 20:29.322
I will.

20:38.233 --> 20:40.701
You were right about
her, she's smart.

20:40.703 --> 20:44.072
Special kid, lots of problems.

20:44.074 --> 20:47.809
What do you think are
the underlying issues?

20:47.811 --> 20:52.514
Depression, bipolar disorder
with deep-seeded narcissism.

20:52.516 --> 20:56.586
I'm gonna need her full file to
know what memories to target.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.988
Parents don't want full disclosure.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.524
What? Why? I signed an agreement!

21:01.526 --> 21:05.061
She's been in and out of boarding
schools, involved in some incidents...

21:05.063 --> 21:07.063
but you don't need
to get into that.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.233
Just let her take
the lead, you know?

21:09.235 --> 21:12.836
I mean... a few memories where
the parents screw up.

21:12.838 --> 21:17.408
As you know, usually, the dramatic experience
of actually going back into memories...

21:17.410 --> 21:22.013
affects people, gives them perspective
on their present lives...

21:22.015 --> 21:25.317
to stop overeating, stop
smoking... whatever.

21:25.319 --> 21:28.420
Make her eat. Simple case.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.399
Will I know I'm in a memory?

21:40.401 --> 21:43.603
It should feel like it's
happening for the first time...

21:43.605 --> 21:46.974
but it'll be different
from the original event.

21:46.976 --> 21:51.678
Because your unconscious mind will
know that you've been there before.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.580
Also...

21:53.582 --> 21:56.650
me being there makes it different.

21:58.252 --> 22:02.457
The equipment is useful
to record the session.

22:14.270 --> 22:16.672
I will be watching you
for the whole time.

22:16.674 --> 22:21.043
If anything happens, I can bring
you back, right away. Okay?

22:21.045 --> 22:24.914
Now, you may see me in the distance,
but you won't know that it's me.

22:24.916 --> 22:28.752
If I'm next to you, you won't
be able to see me at all...

22:28.754 --> 22:30.020
unless I call you back.

22:30.022 --> 22:31.988
Understand?

22:31.990 --> 22:34.190
Yes.

22:34.192 --> 22:37.328
Please put these in your ears.

22:37.330 --> 22:40.665
They conceal a tone,
hidden in white noise.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.434
It enables the brain to
go into a theta state.

22:43.436 --> 22:45.636
Can we use my metronome as well?

22:45.638 --> 22:47.738
Uh... sure.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.847
Where are we going?

22:55.849 --> 22:57.582
Focus on your first memory.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.751
The further back we
can go, the better.

23:02.022 --> 23:03.890
Give me your hands.

23:07.394 --> 23:09.328
Relax.

23:10.164 --> 23:13.032
Think about that first memory.

23:13.034 --> 23:16.470
At first, your memories will
jump around, but that's okay.

23:26.181 --> 23:28.116
When you're ready...

23:28.118 --> 23:29.417
close your eyes.

23:47.938 --> 23:50.940
Let's begin...

23:57.115 --> 23:58.482
now.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.417
I like you being here with us...

24:00.419 --> 24:02.686
We all know you like girls.

24:05.124 --> 24:07.291
She's just a girl for god sakes!

24:07.293 --> 24:08.793
We have a responsibility!

24:08.795 --> 24:10.027
Let me out!

24:10.029 --> 24:12.363
She needs to be in an institution!

24:12.365 --> 24:14.665
She's my daughter!

24:19.472 --> 24:23.242
This old man, he played three.

24:23.244 --> 24:26.411
He played knick-knack on my knee.

24:26.413 --> 24:28.714
With a knick-knack paddy whack...

24:28.716 --> 24:30.450
give a dog a bone...

24:30.452 --> 24:34.420
this old man came rolling home.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.342
What game are you playing, honey?

24:54.344 --> 24:56.678
Can I play with you?

25:00.483 --> 25:02.717
You have to be quiet.

25:06.456 --> 25:08.658
What are you up to?

25:12.463 --> 25:15.398
Mommy's not feeling well today.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.633
You can't do that!
You can't just...

25:17.635 --> 25:20.604
We have to think about Anna.
Anna is the focus of the attention.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.406
Don't you think I'm
thinking about her?

25:22.408 --> 25:25.075
We have a responsibility!
We are not the right people!

25:25.077 --> 25:27.377
This is not the place
for her, Michelle!

25:40.659 --> 25:44.029
Come with me, young lady! Dad!
Let me down!

25:47.034 --> 25:50.636
I'll let you out when you realize
that spying on people is wrong.

25:50.638 --> 25:52.338
For god's sakes, She's only a girl!

25:52.340 --> 25:54.106
She's different, Michelle.

25:54.108 --> 25:57.911
She's not like other children, she
needs to be in an institution.

26:02.083 --> 26:05.285
Well, why isn't it here, then?
Because I put it in here.

26:08.090 --> 26:09.891
She's my daughter.

26:09.893 --> 26:13.261
She tried to stab you,
for Christ's sakes!

26:13.263 --> 26:14.729
Mom!

26:18.000 --> 26:21.135
And coming back... now.

26:23.974 --> 26:25.841
Ow.

26:25.843 --> 26:28.010
Are you okay?

26:28.012 --> 26:29.511
You were there?

26:29.513 --> 26:31.680
I was right next to you.

26:31.682 --> 26:34.484
Spooky.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.353
Can we do more?

26:37.355 --> 26:38.955
Next time.

26:44.929 --> 26:50.668
Self-involved, emotionally stunted retards
is what one hopes for in parents.

26:50.670 --> 26:52.970
Did you see the letter opener?

26:52.972 --> 26:55.072
I did.

26:55.074 --> 26:58.742
Maybe my stepdad is the one you should
be testing for personality disorders.

26:58.744 --> 27:01.613
Is he why you're on
a hunger strike?

27:07.320 --> 27:10.021
So you married?

27:10.023 --> 27:12.224
I was.

27:12.226 --> 27:14.794
What was her name?

27:14.796 --> 27:16.028
Same as yours.

27:18.932 --> 27:21.000
I like her already.

27:23.370 --> 27:24.705
Show me a picture.

27:24.707 --> 27:27.174
I don't carry one anymore.

27:27.176 --> 27:29.443
C'mon, John.

27:29.445 --> 27:32.746
A guy like you always has
a picture in his wallet.

27:32.748 --> 27:34.748
I'll show you a picture...

27:34.750 --> 27:36.985
if you agree to eat something.

27:41.056 --> 27:43.958
You wanna see her?

27:43.960 --> 27:46.094
It's up to you.

27:54.537 --> 27:56.271
Robert desperately
wants to put me away.

27:56.273 --> 27:59.942
And something like LSD in my
food would make me act crazy.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.014
Well then, let's flip out together.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.149
If I start hallucinating,
you'll demand a drug test...

28:06.151 --> 28:08.651
before they lock me away
in a padded room, right?

28:08.653 --> 28:11.121
I swear.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.856
C mon, let's eat!

28:26.939 --> 28:28.907
She's pretty.

28:38.051 --> 28:41.521
<i>Eat slowly so you don't
make yourself sick.</i>

28:45.459 --> 28:50.730
Why do you wanna see this
antique letter opener?

28:50.732 --> 28:54.334
I like to confirm memories,
just to be sure.

28:54.336 --> 28:56.737
I cut her accidentally.

28:57.572 --> 28:59.840
It's always haunted me.

29:01.509 --> 29:03.577
Is your husband here?
Mm-hm.

29:03.579 --> 29:06.081
Can I talk to you both?

29:06.083 --> 29:08.049
Why?

29:08.051 --> 29:11.719
Anna just started to eat.

29:11.721 --> 29:13.822
So, will I see you at
7:00 to celebrate?

29:13.824 --> 29:16.124
Okay, shall I pick you up then?

29:16.126 --> 29:18.094
Sure, why not?

29:18.096 --> 29:20.162
But only one drink.

29:50.229 --> 29:52.296
So you like being a nurse?

29:52.298 --> 29:54.032
I like helping people.

29:54.034 --> 29:56.502
You take your job
quite seriously, huh?

29:56.504 --> 30:00.205
Well, if you can't do what you love, then
at least make sure you love what you do.

30:00.207 --> 30:01.707
Isn't that what they say?

30:01.709 --> 30:05.344
They do say that, that
is absolutely true.

30:08.082 --> 30:10.783
I think you're doing a
great job with Anna.

30:10.785 --> 30:14.120
Thank you for your confidence.

30:14.122 --> 30:17.323
Sometimes I don't think I'm
gonna be able to help her.

30:17.325 --> 30:18.892
Why?

30:21.429 --> 30:23.864
My wife and I had a baby boy...

30:23.866 --> 30:27.301
who died a few months
after he was born.

30:27.303 --> 30:34.309
My wife kept wanting to go back to the
time when he was still alive, and...

30:34.311 --> 30:36.878
eventually the time came when...

30:36.880 --> 30:41.082
she wasn't happy unless
she was in the memory.

30:41.084 --> 30:43.185
She became obsessed.

30:43.187 --> 30:48.090
So, I refused to take her
to the past anymore.

30:48.092 --> 30:54.997
She... spiraled downward, she...
became depressed and I lost her.

30:57.268 --> 31:00.337
I couldn't help her.

31:00.339 --> 31:05.576
I tried to keep her in the house,
but you can't lock someone up...

31:05.578 --> 31:08.412
just because of your own fears.

31:20.092 --> 31:21.259
I had a great time.

31:21.261 --> 31:22.661
Me, too.

31:22.663 --> 31:25.197
I hope I didn't talk too much.
Oh, you did...

31:25.199 --> 31:26.999
but I liked it.

31:27.001 --> 31:28.867
Thank you.

31:28.869 --> 31:33.907
So, you're not even gonna try
to come up, so I can say no?

31:33.909 --> 31:35.709
Uh...

31:39.013 --> 31:42.015
I gotta go.

31:42.017 --> 31:43.850
Safe home.

31:52.361 --> 31:55.329
It's not your fault, John!

31:57.866 --> 32:00.402
It's not your fault, John!

32:09.213 --> 32:11.848
I'm telling you, Sebastian,
I saw her last night.

32:11.850 --> 32:14.117
That's impossible.

32:14.119 --> 32:16.719
<i>She's under lock and key,
never allowed to leave her room.</i>

32:16.721 --> 32:19.489
I know, but I... I know what I saw.

32:19.491 --> 32:22.558
<i>Do you, John?
Is everything all right?</i>

32:22.560 --> 32:23.626
Everything's fine.

32:50.857 --> 32:54.760
We may have one, because
there are blind spots.

32:54.762 --> 32:56.662
What's happened?

32:56.664 --> 32:59.165
Anna pushed Judith down the stairs.

32:59.167 --> 33:02.969
Judith is in the hospital
with multiple fractures.

33:04.505 --> 33:06.039
Look at this.

33:08.142 --> 33:12.079
Oh, my god!

33:12.081 --> 33:14.449
There's no other angle at
the top of the stairs?

33:14.451 --> 33:18.052
Blind spot.

33:18.054 --> 33:20.755
On Monday, Anna will be
confined to an institution...

33:20.757 --> 33:23.391
that can properly
address her needs.

33:23.393 --> 33:29.531
Fortunately, as a family friend, Judith
will not be pressing any charges.

33:29.533 --> 33:31.567
I didn't do it, John.

33:31.569 --> 33:34.169
Then why would Judith say you did?

33:34.171 --> 33:36.505
Judith always sneaks
back in late at night.

33:36.507 --> 33:39.776
Mom's knocked-out on sleeping pills,
and that's when they have sex.

33:39.778 --> 33:43.012
Who? Robert and Judith?

33:43.014 --> 33:46.182
He always sleeps with the good
looking help. Just ask Jaime.

33:46.184 --> 33:48.017
I mean, you saw what she was doing
with Robert in the library.

33:48.019 --> 33:51.655
I don't believe you.

33:51.657 --> 33:54.859
When she first came here,
Judith had tried to make friends with me.

33:54.861 --> 33:56.694
And she was all like,
"I have no luck with men".

33:56.696 --> 33:58.195
Well, my stepfather moved right in.

33:58.197 --> 34:00.431
You know, maybe... maybe they
had a fight, it got violent...

34:00.433 --> 34:02.400
and now they're trying to cover it
up by blaming it on the sick girl.

34:02.402 --> 34:04.603
Or maybe Robert just
cold-bloodedly pushed her, okay?

34:04.605 --> 34:07.606
This is exactly the kind of thing
he's been hoping for to lock me up.

34:07.608 --> 34:08.907
Oh, c'mon, Anna.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.542
Open your eyes, John!

34:10.543 --> 34:13.844
My mother's family is one
of the richest in America.

34:13.847 --> 34:16.380
And Robert's on an allowance.

34:16.382 --> 34:20.887
If I die, the money goes to a
charitable trust and he gets zilch.

34:20.889 --> 34:22.755
But if I'm committed...

34:22.757 --> 34:25.925
I get the money,
but I have no rights.

34:25.927 --> 34:27.994
Robert controls every penny.

34:27.996 --> 34:30.130
And I'm sure Judith knows this.

34:30.132 --> 34:33.734
Maybe he was afraid that she was gonna tell
you and that you'd find out his secret plans.

34:33.735 --> 34:37.237
And I'm sure he told you, only moments ago,
that they send me to an institution on Monday.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.739
Am I right?

34:38.741 --> 34:42.076
Please, John, you have to help
me prove that I'm innocent.

34:42.078 --> 34:45.447
You're the only person
they're gonna trust.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.681
I... I can't get send away to a
mental institution.

34:47.684 --> 34:49.317
I won't survive that.

34:49.319 --> 34:52.120
I know... I know I'm different,
not like other girls...

34:52.121 --> 34:54.723
but doesn't mean I'm a murderer.

34:54.725 --> 34:57.893
I don't even... I don't even think of doing
half the things they're accusing me of!

34:57.895 --> 34:59.628
Please, John!

34:59.630 --> 35:02.998
Help me figure out what the
hell's going on with me.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.301
I mean, you're all I have.

35:39.772 --> 35:41.373
John.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.277
How do you feel?

35:45.613 --> 35:48.181
Pretty out of it.

35:48.183 --> 35:53.186
Judith, did you see...
Anna push you down the stairs?

35:54.288 --> 35:56.557
Are you here for Anna or for me?

35:56.559 --> 35:59.059
I'm here for you.

35:59.061 --> 36:00.594
But I need to know what happened.

36:02.063 --> 36:05.699
I know I went to
bring her some food.

36:07.502 --> 36:11.573
I thought I locked the door.

36:11.575 --> 36:14.609
Why don't you go to my memory?

36:17.013 --> 36:22.251
Ah... doesn't work like that.

36:22.253 --> 36:25.288
How do you know it wasn't Robert?

36:25.290 --> 36:27.023
Robert?

36:27.891 --> 36:29.959
Judith, I know.

36:29.961 --> 36:32.695
Know what?

36:32.697 --> 36:35.999
I know about you and Robert.

36:36.001 --> 36:39.069
Did he hit on me?

36:41.039 --> 36:43.206
Whatever, doesn't matter.

36:43.208 --> 36:47.078
There's nothing going on
between me and Robert.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.052
Look, I...

36:56.188 --> 36:58.222
I hope you get better soon.

37:08.902 --> 37:11.671
I can't believe that
Anna would hurt Judith.

37:11.673 --> 37:13.840
Can you help my daughter, John?

37:13.842 --> 37:15.875
I believe I can, Mrs. Greene.

37:15.877 --> 37:19.946
I can take her to her traumatic memories,
help her understand her behavior.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.616
And I wanna find out the truth.

37:22.618 --> 37:25.686
My husband wants to send her to
a professional care facility.

37:25.688 --> 37:28.556
I don't want that, but he's already
paid the registration fee...

37:28.558 --> 37:30.558
and they're expecting
her in a week.

37:30.560 --> 37:35.529
As soon as I see that file, I'll
know what I should be looking for.

37:35.531 --> 37:39.534
I'll have Sebastian's assistant
send it to you right away.

37:39.536 --> 37:41.837
Sebastian has it?

37:45.175 --> 37:48.777
<i>You'll see why the family didn't
want you to see the file.</i>

37:48.779 --> 37:50.313
<i>It's strong stuff, John.</i>

37:50.315 --> 37:52.348
You said this was a simple case.

37:52.350 --> 37:54.283
<i>And it should have been, John.</i>

37:54.285 --> 37:56.753
Maybe you're not
ready to come back.

37:56.755 --> 37:59.455
Look... they're gonna put Anna
in an institution.

37:59.457 --> 38:02.993
If you'd sent me the file earlier,
maybe I could have prevented all this.

38:02.995 --> 38:06.830
<i>Are you sure you want to
continue with the case?</i>

38:06.832 --> 38:08.899
I'm Anna's best hope right now.

38:08.901 --> 38:12.603
I'll call you in a couple of days.

38:53.148 --> 38:55.583
<i>Do you know why you're here, Anna?</i>

38:55.585 --> 38:57.852
That's pretty obvious.

38:57.854 --> 39:01.222
<i>For just one day, can we talk</i>
<i>about something other than me?</i>

39:01.224 --> 39:04.526
<i>What made you try to kill yourself?</i>

39:04.528 --> 39:06.695
Red...

39:06.697 --> 39:09.298
<i>it's such a dark, rich color.</i>

39:09.300 --> 39:12.234
<i>Particular shade,
it's hard to come by.</i>

39:14.738 --> 39:17.674
<i>Blood... it's red.</i>

39:17.676 --> 39:19.309
It's kind of beautiful.

39:19.311 --> 39:22.512
<i>Can you tell me about your
relationship with your parents?</i>

39:22.514 --> 39:27.150
<i>My mother's trying harder, I suppose,
but it's still pretty pathetic.</i>

39:27.152 --> 39:32.490
<i>Her heart's like... one of those fancy
ice sculptures they have at parties.</i>

39:32.492 --> 39:36.127
<i>Do you really want to know the answer?</i>
<i>Please.</i>

39:36.129 --> 39:40.264
It's my parents who
are crazy... not me.

39:44.570 --> 39:49.341
<i>Did you have feelings for your teacher?
Mr. Tatum?</i>

39:49.343 --> 39:52.277
<i>That school was depressing.</i>
<i>He was nice.</i>

39:52.279 --> 39:54.280
Did he take pictures of you?

39:54.282 --> 39:55.649
<i>Would you mind if I
take a picture of you?</i>

39:55.650 --> 39:56.883
<i>Yes.</i>

39:56.885 --> 39:59.018
<i>What kind of pictures?</i>

39:59.020 --> 40:01.354
Artistic photos.

40:08.129 --> 40:12.132
It was like a Jackson
Pollock painting...

40:12.134 --> 40:14.868
where the blood sprayed
across the floor.

40:17.772 --> 40:21.242
I can still see the exact
pattern when I close my eyes.

40:21.244 --> 40:24.145
<i>Do you want to die, Anna?</i>

40:24.147 --> 40:26.581
Don't we all die in the end?

40:28.017 --> 40:29.250
It's kind of a freedom.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.152
There are other ways to be free.

40:31.154 --> 40:34.023
Not if you're not
allowed to have it.

40:34.025 --> 40:36.659
Then what do you do?

41:01.486 --> 41:03.521
Will you lift your chin a bit?

41:08.360 --> 41:11.029
How do you feel when you draw?

41:11.031 --> 41:14.132
Like the whole world disappears.

41:14.134 --> 41:17.202
Like nothing else matters.

41:17.204 --> 41:19.104
All right, finished.

41:19.106 --> 41:20.138
Can I see it?

41:20.140 --> 41:24.177
Not yet.

41:24.179 --> 41:25.578
Can I have your bag?

41:32.720 --> 41:35.155
Promise me you'll look
at it when you get home?

41:35.157 --> 41:36.957
I promise.

41:36.959 --> 41:39.894
Are we even now?

41:39.896 --> 41:41.195
Can we start the session?

41:41.197 --> 41:43.530
Yeah, we can.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.011
Mousey?
It's extremely dangerous.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.913
My real name is Megan Scanlon.

41:57.915 --> 42:00.283
Had sex with your teacher?

42:00.285 --> 42:02.018
Who you raping, bitch?

42:30.950 --> 42:33.551
Hi, I'm Mousey.

42:37.057 --> 42:40.092
Mousey?
That's really your name?

42:40.094 --> 42:41.627
It's what the people here call me.

42:41.629 --> 42:45.264
My real name is
Megan, Megan Scanlon.

42:45.266 --> 42:47.032
So Susan Merricks your roommate.

42:47.034 --> 42:48.969
What's she really like?

42:48.971 --> 42:51.738
I heard she was training for the
Olympics, had a nervous breakdown...

42:51.740 --> 42:53.573
beat up a horse or something.

42:53.575 --> 42:57.877
Oh, great!
Frigid and Mousey are here.

42:57.879 --> 43:00.547
Look, just because I've been
assigned to watch over you...

43:00.549 --> 43:04.919
doesn't mean you have to be in
the room all the time, Frigid.

43:04.921 --> 43:06.354
Name's Anna.

43:06.356 --> 43:10.224
Capital A, N, N, A.

43:10.226 --> 43:13.761
Leave.

43:13.763 --> 43:15.097
Now.

43:19.802 --> 43:23.305
Or maybe the reason you won't go is
because you wanna watch me changing.

43:23.307 --> 43:25.774
Right, Frigid?

43:29.713 --> 43:32.915
What are you doing?
No! No! No! Please don't!

43:32.917 --> 43:34.951
No! No! No! Stop!

43:39.992 --> 43:45.562
Cameras will be locked up, and can only
be signed out for a day at a time.

43:49.801 --> 43:53.038
The chemicals you will be
using could be harmful...

43:53.040 --> 43:58.743
and any misuses, however slight,
will end your art privileges.

43:58.745 --> 44:03.882
Now, who here has experience
with the art of photography?

44:32.648 --> 44:34.215
Anna.

44:34.217 --> 44:38.619
Someone broke into the principal's
house and stole all the alcohol.

44:38.621 --> 44:40.621
Do you know who might
have done this?

44:57.408 --> 44:59.142
House Mother, you're
talking to someone...

44:59.144 --> 45:03.513
who takes the harmful effects
of alcohol very seriously.

45:03.515 --> 45:06.149
Drinking is the
Devil's calling card.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.195
Hey, Anna, look.

45:19.699 --> 45:22.367
I'm so, so sorry about
the closet. I...

45:22.369 --> 45:24.970
Oh, don't worry about it.

45:24.972 --> 45:29.307
Some friends are coming over to tea
tomorrow. Do you want to join us?

45:29.309 --> 45:31.711
Can Megan come?

45:31.713 --> 45:35.047
What, Mousey? She's such a retard.

45:35.049 --> 45:36.916
Yeah, she is.

45:53.635 --> 45:57.472
Do you copy your roses from
the rose bushes out there?

45:57.474 --> 46:00.008
Roses don't grow during the winter.

46:02.344 --> 46:06.548
Sometimes we remember things the way we want
to, rather than the way they really were.

46:06.550 --> 46:11.554
I didn't do anything to those girls,
if that's what you're implying.

46:11.556 --> 46:17.193
False memories can have a... a
rushed feeling to them...

46:17.195 --> 46:19.128
a lack of detail.

46:19.130 --> 46:23.466
The windows won't have views or
none of the clocks will work.

46:23.468 --> 46:27.804
Well, if you ever find me, ah,
particularly attractive in a memory...

46:27.806 --> 46:30.240
it's probably because
I'm making it up, too.

46:30.242 --> 46:34.111
I wouldn't picture myself having a bad
skin day if I knew you'd be around.

46:34.113 --> 46:37.982
Hey, I'm not kidding, okay?

46:37.984 --> 46:40.384
I can accept we don't exactly
know what we're looking for...

46:40.386 --> 46:42.353
but your memories have to be real!

46:42.355 --> 46:43.921
You have to be very careful!

46:43.923 --> 46:45.856
Has something told you
I've been making them up?

46:45.858 --> 46:49.661
Yeah, I saw a clock on the wall,
the hands weren't moving.

46:49.663 --> 46:52.364
The one in the dorm hallway, right?

46:52.366 --> 46:54.166
Yeah.

46:54.168 --> 46:56.735
That one never worked.

46:56.737 --> 47:01.107
We used to call our gym teacher, Mr. Pierce
"The Clock", because he didn't work, either.

47:18.226 --> 47:20.661
You never leave the house, right?

47:24.333 --> 47:26.067
Not anymore.

48:09.181 --> 48:11.416
You've got 20 minutes.

48:21.961 --> 48:24.129
Mr. Ortega?

48:24.131 --> 48:27.634
So, what are you?
Some kind of therapist?

48:27.636 --> 48:30.970
Do you know what a
memory detective is?

48:32.206 --> 48:35.075
Somebody who takes
rich people's money.

48:35.077 --> 48:36.943
Well, that's me.

48:36.945 --> 48:40.848
Has Anna's family hired you to
find out if she has a soul?

48:40.850 --> 48:43.284
I'm just here to
find out the truth.

48:43.286 --> 48:46.854
That family is a nightmare.

48:46.856 --> 48:49.590
You dig too deep,
better watch your step.

48:49.592 --> 48:53.028
You're lucky you didn't get 20
years for seducing a minor.

48:53.030 --> 48:57.899
I'm not saying I wasn't at
fault, but that girl...

48:57.901 --> 49:03.905
that girl was everywhere I
turned... flirting...

49:03.907 --> 49:09.712
finding ways to get us alone.

49:09.714 --> 49:11.948
I've lost everything.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.987
My job, my fiance, my freedom...

49:16.989 --> 49:22.126
my entire fucking
life, because of her.

49:22.128 --> 49:25.462
Anna's family throws money
around like confetti.

49:25.464 --> 49:27.631
They can get to anybody.

49:27.633 --> 49:30.802
Cops, district attorneys...

49:30.804 --> 49:34.372
They've covered up all the
bad stuff Anna's done.

49:34.374 --> 49:38.643
Then, had me thrown in here
for something I didn't do.

49:38.645 --> 49:42.915
I'm sure that they even covered
it up when she tried to kill...

49:42.917 --> 49:46.152
those three girls at
school that same year.

49:46.154 --> 49:49.422
Anna blamed it all on
another girl, Mousey...

49:49.424 --> 49:52.425
but no one could find
out who she was.

49:52.427 --> 49:58.064
Not even Susan Merrick s family
was able to take Anna to court.

49:58.066 --> 50:02.369
I'd love that family to finally
get what's coming to them.

50:24.794 --> 50:26.862
Susan Merrick?

50:29.432 --> 50:33.736
My name is John Washington. Can I ask
you a few questions about Anna Greene?

50:33.738 --> 50:37.540
Are you a cop?

50:37.542 --> 50:39.742
No, I'm not a cop, Ms. Merrick.

50:39.744 --> 50:41.478
What? Has she died or something?

50:41.480 --> 50:43.646
No... not at all.

50:43.648 --> 50:48.819
I just want to find out what happened, what
really happened at the Whitten Academy.

50:48.821 --> 50:51.489
You think Anna was responsible.

50:51.491 --> 50:54.859
Of course, she was a total psycho.

50:54.861 --> 50:58.597
There were a lot of other girls there
with problems. Could have been anyone.

50:58.599 --> 51:00.899
I got on with everyone.

51:00.901 --> 51:04.669
Did you have a girl named
Mousey at your school?

51:04.671 --> 51:08.707
No... I don't think so.

51:08.709 --> 51:10.309
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

51:10.311 --> 51:12.378
Miss Merrick, I know what
you've been through.

51:13.714 --> 51:16.249
I know it must have
been extremely painful.

51:16.251 --> 51:19.552
I really need your help.

51:19.554 --> 51:23.123
Do you have any specific memory
of Anna you think I should know?

51:24.926 --> 51:28.495
Yeah... sure I do.

52:03.100 --> 52:08.238
Anna seriously has balls. She was like
"drinking is the Devil's calling card".

52:08.240 --> 52:10.073
It was awesome.

52:13.478 --> 52:17.748
Hey, Anna, do you want a cup?

52:17.750 --> 52:19.150
No, thanks.

52:19.152 --> 52:20.685
You sure?

52:20.687 --> 52:23.054
Yeah.

52:29.462 --> 52:31.196
I like you being here with us.

53:23.820 --> 53:27.157
And coming back... now.

53:37.301 --> 53:41.773
You saw Mousey, right? She did it.

53:41.775 --> 53:45.810
So you didn't poison those girls?
Of course, not.

53:47.279 --> 53:52.584
Your prints were all over the teapot.
Because I picked it up once or twice.

53:52.586 --> 53:55.954
And why would I wipe the poison clean,
but leave my prints on the teapot?

53:55.956 --> 53:59.358
Not to mention hiding the
poison under my bed.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.061
Maybe you're too smart
for your own good.

54:02.063 --> 54:04.064
If you'd wiped the pot,
that would point to you.

54:04.066 --> 54:08.001
Maybe you just didn't have
time to hide the poison.

54:08.003 --> 54:10.070
It was Megan, John.

54:11.072 --> 54:13.139
Why didn't you go to the cops?

54:13.141 --> 54:16.911
What, and tell them that Megan was obsessed
and that she smirked at me as I was led away?

54:16.913 --> 54:18.579
Why not?

54:18.581 --> 54:21.082
You're forgetting what it's
like to be a teenager.

54:21.084 --> 54:25.352
Adults telling you what to do, having opinion
about what you say, before you even say it.

54:25.354 --> 54:29.257
There's no Mousey, Anna.
What?

54:29.259 --> 54:31.960
What are you talking about?
There's no Megan at the school.

54:31.962 --> 54:34.730
Oh, you don't believe me?
Do you blame me?

54:34.732 --> 54:40.068
Megan transferred in during the second
semester and left right after I got expelled.

54:40.070 --> 54:41.470
You know, who the hell
do you think I am?

54:41.472 --> 54:42.939
Please tell me, John!

54:42.941 --> 54:44.674
What... what, you think
I'm some psychopath?

54:44.676 --> 54:47.376
What? This is the second day in
a row you've called me a liar!

54:47.378 --> 54:50.113
I want to know why you're
suddenly turning on me!

54:51.415 --> 54:54.017
Here! My yearbook!

54:54.019 --> 54:55.519
Asshole.

55:10.302 --> 55:13.238
You won't mind if I hang on
to this for a couple of days?

55:13.240 --> 55:16.007
Sleep with it under your
pillow, for all I care.

55:16.009 --> 55:17.842
We don't have much time.

55:17.844 --> 55:22.548
I want you to think about all the key
moments in your life by tomorrow.

55:22.550 --> 55:24.250
Can you do that for me?

55:25.252 --> 55:26.585
Fine.

56:34.695 --> 56:36.394
John...

56:36.396 --> 56:38.296
John, Why don't you help me?

56:38.298 --> 56:40.665
Why don't you wanna help me?

56:40.667 --> 56:42.267
Mom!

56:43.904 --> 56:50.409
This old man, he played three.

56:50.411 --> 56:54.313
He played knick-knack on my knee.

56:54.315 --> 56:56.315
With a knick-knack paddy whack...

56:56.317 --> 56:58.784
give a dog a bone, this old...

56:58.786 --> 57:01.221
Who's there?

57:23.779 --> 57:24.914
Anna?

57:28.518 --> 57:29.852
Anna!

57:37.062 --> 57:38.662
Hello?

58:34.622 --> 58:37.925
Hey!

58:37.927 --> 58:39.260
Wait!

58:51.007 --> 58:53.309
Wait!

59:16.334 --> 59:18.002
Is there somewhere
I can freshen up?

59:18.004 --> 59:21.139
There's a bathroom just down
that corridor on your left.

59:21.141 --> 59:22.740
Oh, thank you.

01:01:05.218 --> 01:01:09.556
What are you doing in here?

01:01:09.558 --> 01:01:12.159
Maybe I'm looking for the
guy from last night.

01:01:14.862 --> 01:01:20.233
You know, Mr. Greene, it really isn't
necessary to have me followed.

01:01:20.235 --> 01:01:23.504
I had you extensively looked
into before you were hired.

01:01:23.506 --> 01:01:26.107
I don't have anyone
following you now.

01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:30.811
And now, if you'd be so kind, your
work in this house is upstairs.

01:02:27.174 --> 01:02:29.008
Very nice, Anna.

01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:34.680
Not just yet.

01:03:17.762 --> 01:03:20.630
Glad you're back from zombie land.

01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:23.199
You okay, want some water?

01:03:27.806 --> 01:03:31.609
Aren't they great?
Better than what you had before.

01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:34.445
How did you do that?

01:03:34.447 --> 01:03:36.714
I just downloaded it.

01:03:36.716 --> 01:03:39.016
No, how did you leave
me alone in the memory?

01:03:39.018 --> 01:03:41.219
I don't know.

01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:45.691
Suddenly I was back here, and our hands
were separated, but you were still under.

01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:48.126
I wasn't sure what to do.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.234
You looked cute while
you were sleeping.

01:04:04.713 --> 01:04:08.082
Anna, do you know
what transference is?

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.718
I do.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.820
Then you'll know it's
perfectly natural to...

01:04:12.822 --> 01:04:16.490
To what? Have strong feelings
for your therapist?

01:04:16.492 --> 01:04:19.594
I just simply said I liked
watching you sleep.

01:04:21.063 --> 01:04:23.832
Your teacher was a lot older
than you, he took advantage.

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:28.002
He was encouraging... that
place was so depressing.

01:04:28.004 --> 01:04:30.039
What about the photos?

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:33.743
He said they were for art, and
at first they were artistic.

01:06:07.778 --> 01:06:09.546
You okay? You don't look too good.

01:06:09.548 --> 01:06:11.982
I'm having trouble
staying grounded.

01:06:11.984 --> 01:06:14.551
Side-effects from the sessions?
Hallucinations?

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:18.222
Yeah... terrible headaches. I
can't sleep... nightmares.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.860
Plus the guy they've hired to follow me...
he's... he is everywhere I go.

01:06:21.862 --> 01:06:27.565
Maybe events have made this case far bigger
than you were ready for when you started.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.667
Maybe we should ask
Lundgren to take over.

01:06:29.669 --> 01:06:32.871
No! No way, no.
I can handle it.

01:06:35.442 --> 01:06:38.244
Did you ever treat
Anna at their house?

01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:39.578
No.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.781
Did you ever have reason to
suspect abuse within the family?

01:06:42.783 --> 01:06:44.316
Nothing with the stepfather?

01:06:44.318 --> 01:06:48.154
Highly unlikely. I mean, look,
Robert's a prominent guy.

01:06:48.156 --> 01:06:51.491
I wouldn't go down that
road based on a hunch.

01:06:51.493 --> 01:06:54.327
Tom Ortega told me Anna's
parents set him up for...

01:06:54.329 --> 01:06:57.097
You went to see Tom Ortega?

01:06:57.099 --> 01:06:59.867
That lowlife took dirty
pictures of Anna.

01:06:59.869 --> 01:07:03.037
You should be focusing on the sessions,
not investigating in the real world.

01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:04.805
You need to be objective, John.

01:07:04.807 --> 01:07:08.776
There is something going on
there behind the scenes...

01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:10.444
I need to find out what it is.

01:07:10.446 --> 01:07:13.782
You need to consider that this job
is too big and too complex...

01:07:13.784 --> 01:07:16.184
and that you are becoming
too personally involved.

01:07:16.186 --> 01:07:19.187
Whatever it is, I'm gonna
find out the truth.

01:07:47.986 --> 01:07:50.322
Do you know where you want to go?

01:07:50.324 --> 01:07:55.126
I went through all the photos and
one of them made me feel something.

01:07:55.128 --> 01:07:56.328
Don't tell me.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:58.797
Don't corrupt the
memory, just go there.

01:08:03.236 --> 01:08:07.106
When you're ready, close your eyes.

01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:13.212
Let's begin... now.

01:08:17.986 --> 01:08:20.720
My parents brought him to me.
Who?

01:08:20.723 --> 01:08:22.389
I don't remember his name.

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:35.203
This old man, he played three.

01:08:35.205 --> 01:08:38.139
He played knick-knack on my knee.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.511
With a knick-knack paddy whack,
give a dog a bone.

01:08:42.513 --> 01:08:46.682
This old man came rolling home.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.274
What are you doing
over there, Anna?

01:09:12.877 --> 01:09:16.881
Why don't you come here...
next to me.

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:21.219
Come here, sweetheart.

01:09:31.832 --> 01:09:33.032
Don't be afraid.

01:09:35.002 --> 01:09:38.970
I won't hurt you.

01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:41.207
And coming back... now!

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:47.548
Anna?

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.283
Anna, can you hear me?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.653
You're okay, you fainted.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:53.921
What happened?

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:56.357
Can you get some water. She's okay.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.993
Yeah, sure.

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.632
Take this.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.702
What is it?

01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:11.040
It's a bit of one of your mom's
sedatives. It'll help you sleep.

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:20.350
So, what happens now?

01:10:20.352 --> 01:10:24.688
Now... you get better.

01:10:41.507 --> 01:10:46.145
This is the key to the house my
parents lived in when I was born.

01:10:46.147 --> 01:10:49.047
I always felt safe there.

01:10:49.049 --> 01:10:51.884
So many times in my life
people have been unkind.

01:10:51.886 --> 01:10:55.754
I can't thank you enough, John.

01:10:55.756 --> 01:10:59.692
Will you keep this
with you at all times?

01:10:59.694 --> 01:11:02.796
If I know you have it, then at least I
know that there's someone out there...

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:04.464
who's on my side.

01:11:04.466 --> 01:11:07.767
I might not be going
to an institution...

01:11:07.769 --> 01:11:10.671
but I still feel trapped.

01:11:10.673 --> 01:11:12.239
Sure.

01:11:29.425 --> 01:11:32.194
Hey! Hey!

01:11:35.766 --> 01:11:38.968
John? What are you doing here? You should
have called, I've got dinner guests.

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:40.803
Why Sebastian?

01:11:40.805 --> 01:11:42.939
Christ! She was just a child.

01:11:42.941 --> 01:11:45.208
What's going on?
You've been drinking?

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:51.415
These were in Anna's memories.
Have you been in my office?

01:11:51.417 --> 01:11:55.519
I've seen you with her, in the
library, in one of the memories.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:57.888
Oh, I might have been
there once, I forgot!

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:59.791
What's this all about?

01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:03.361
You said you never treated her at
the house, but you were there!

01:12:04.964 --> 01:12:07.899
Are you trying to say I
did something to her?

01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:09.901
Think this through, John.

01:12:09.903 --> 01:12:15.107
Why would I ask you to take on a
case, if I was guilty of something?

01:12:15.109 --> 01:12:17.309
Think about what it is
you're accusing me of...

01:12:17.311 --> 01:12:21.247
then, think about who
it is you're accusing.

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:23.249
They wanted to hire Peter Lundgren.

01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:26.386
You brought me in, because I
was down, and I was weak...

01:12:26.388 --> 01:12:29.489
and I was easy to manipulate.
Right?

01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:32.993
And you wouldn't let me see that
file until you absolutely had to.

01:12:32.995 --> 01:12:36.196
You said they didn't want me to see
it, but you had it the whole time!

01:12:36.198 --> 01:12:38.432
I never told you I
didn't have the file!

01:12:38.434 --> 01:12:41.602
I said the family wanted privacy.

01:12:41.604 --> 01:12:44.238
What about the other day? Ah?
You wanted me to drop the case.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.840
I said that because...

01:12:45.842 --> 01:12:48.442
Now... I know what you didn't
want me to find out.

01:12:48.444 --> 01:12:50.946
I said that because I
was worried about you!

01:12:50.948 --> 01:12:54.383
Oh, c'mon, John!

01:12:54.385 --> 01:12:57.352
You've been drinking alone.
Having hallucinations for days!

01:12:57.354 --> 01:12:59.688
You're ignoring me
again, Uncle Sebastian

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:01.290
Hi, sweetheart.

01:13:02.459 --> 01:13:05.128
Sorry. John...

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:09.699
Don't you ever go near
Anna again! You hear me?

01:13:12.836 --> 01:13:15.539
John!

01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:16.807
John!

01:13:20.378 --> 01:13:23.647
Due to Anna's early
overt sexualization...

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.282
she has a need for control...

01:13:25.284 --> 01:13:28.887
which manifests itself in
a variety of disorders.

01:13:28.889 --> 01:13:31.489
She has... significant
difficulty...

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:36.328
in forming and maintaining long-term
relationships with others.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.663
Basically, she has developed
a protective shell...

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:40.166
Do you like it?
Which keeps out the pain...

01:13:40.168 --> 01:13:43.836
and keeps out everything else.
It's great.

01:13:43.838 --> 01:13:47.440
She interacts with the world in a completely
different way than the way we do.

01:13:47.442 --> 01:13:50.676
Locking her up is the worst
possible thing you could do.

01:13:56.551 --> 01:14:00.554
Thank you so much, Mr.
Washington.

01:14:00.556 --> 01:14:02.589
Good luck.

01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:09.796
<i>It's not your fault, John.</i>

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.735
<i>This person...
they lied about everything.</i>

01:15:15.737 --> 01:15:19.506
<i>But just because the lies are shocking
and they attract a lot of attention...</i>

01:15:19.508 --> 01:15:22.209
it doesn't necessarily
make them true.

01:15:22.211 --> 01:15:24.578
It was very important for us to...

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.181
<i>to check the facts and
to question the facts...</i>

01:15:27.183 --> 01:15:29.516
until it was evident
that I was innocent.

01:15:29.518 --> 01:15:33.555
<i>And once we've proven my innocence,
we went back to that proof...</i>

01:15:33.557 --> 01:15:36.991
<i>over and over again, and looked</i>
<i>at it with a fresh set of eyes.</i>

01:15:36.993 --> 01:15:41.362
<i>Because only then, were we able
to actually see the truth.</i>

01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:43.865
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:45.634
How does it feel to be designated?

01:15:45.636 --> 01:15:47.403
<i>That's a good question...</i>

01:15:47.405 --> 01:15:48.938
<i>and I just want to thank
my constituency...</i>

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.624
I just downloaded it.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:12.395
Aren't they great? Better
than what you had before.

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:51.937
Hello?
<i>Can you come over?</i>

01:17:51.939 --> 01:17:53.138
I need to see you, John.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.306
Anna, look, I need to talk to...

01:17:54.308 --> 01:17:56.242
Before it's too late!

01:17:56.244 --> 01:17:58.244
<i>Something terrible has
happened and I need to...</i>

01:17:58.246 --> 01:18:02.616
What?
Hello?

01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:04.918
Hello?

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:10.957
<i>You have reached the
Greene's residence.</i>

01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:14.094
<i>Please leave a message and we'll get
back to you as soon as we can.</i>

01:18:56.442 --> 01:18:59.543
Hello?

01:19:37.418 --> 01:19:40.187
Anna?
<i>John.</i>

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:28.005
Hey!

01:20:28.007 --> 01:20:29.940
Open the door!

01:20:29.942 --> 01:20:34.146
<i>John, there's someone in our house!</i>

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:44.791
Shit!

01:20:44.793 --> 01:20:48.194
Mom? Mom?

01:20:48.196 --> 01:20:49.495
Hello?

01:20:49.497 --> 01:20:50.630
<i>Wh... emergency...</i>

01:20:50.632 --> 01:20:51.764
Hello, can you hear me?

01:20:56.170 --> 01:20:57.671
Shit.

01:20:57.673 --> 01:20:59.193
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

01:21:17.293 --> 01:21:22.131
Hey! Hey! Open the goddamn door!

01:22:07.615 --> 01:22:10.048
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:13.386
I'm at 1103 Bayside.

01:22:13.388 --> 01:22:17.724
I have an intruder and
a serious assault.

01:22:17.726 --> 01:22:19.392
Okay, that's right.

01:22:19.394 --> 01:22:22.495
We already have multiple units
responding to that address, sir.

01:22:44.186 --> 01:22:45.320
Anna!

01:22:47.056 --> 01:22:48.823
Wait!

01:23:01.572 --> 01:23:03.840
Anna!

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:21.626
John.

01:23:21.628 --> 01:23:26.064
Anna! You okay? You hurt?

01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:31.136
Look, we're being followed...

01:23:31.138 --> 01:23:35.674
but the police are here, you stay
with me you're gonna be safe. Okay?

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.014
I'm sorry.

01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:44.784
What?

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.054
There's something over there!

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:56.297
Hey! Hey!

01:23:56.299 --> 01:23:57.999
Over here!

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:04.940
Hey! Stop! Stop!

01:24:04.942 --> 01:24:06.942
Hey! Somebody's broken into
the Greene's house!

01:24:06.944 --> 01:24:08.510
Police!
I'm pretty su...

01:24:08.512 --> 01:24:10.245
Stay where you are!
Stay right where you are!

01:24:10.247 --> 01:24:15.984
Hands up, Mr. Washington!
Hands up, Mr. Washington!

01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:48.753
You're suspected of
murder, Mr. Washington.

01:24:52.091 --> 01:24:55.494
We found hundreds of pictures
featuring underage girls...

01:24:55.496 --> 01:24:58.197
in your computer.

01:24:58.199 --> 01:24:59.699
She set me up.

01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:04.503
A 16 year-old girl.

01:25:04.505 --> 01:25:09.743
Look. We know the parents were constantly
threatening to send the girl to an institution...

01:25:09.745 --> 01:25:12.012
and that you... strongly
disagreed with that.

01:25:12.014 --> 01:25:15.248
So the way I see it, you
got too close to the girl.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.751
You drugged the parents, so
you could take her away...

01:25:17.753 --> 01:25:22.890
but she refused to go and you end up doing
something you'd never think you were capable of.

01:25:22.892 --> 01:25:24.692
The parents are okay?

01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:29.864
Yeah... we found the mother's
sleeping pills in the kitchen, John.

01:25:29.866 --> 01:25:34.903
And I'd be willing to bet that your fingerprints
are all over that prescription bottle.

01:25:34.905 --> 01:25:37.606
We found a letter opener,
covered in blood...

01:25:37.608 --> 01:25:40.909
in the forest, where you were.

01:25:40.911 --> 01:25:43.645
I can explain every peace of
evidence you think you have.

01:25:43.647 --> 01:25:49.052
We're carefully going through
the tapes of you chasing Anna.

01:25:49.054 --> 01:25:50.987
Now obviously you disabled
a number of the cameras...

01:25:50.989 --> 01:25:53.590
and then turned the power
off to cover your tracks.

01:25:53.592 --> 01:25:57.928
I was locked inside the
surveillance room!

01:26:02.567 --> 01:26:04.568
Recognize this?

01:26:06.271 --> 01:26:08.072
Anna gave me that.

01:26:11.244 --> 01:26:15.413
It's the key to the
surveillance room.

01:26:16.883 --> 01:26:19.351
You panicked, needed an alibi...

01:26:19.353 --> 01:26:23.823
so you damaged the interior of
the door, but you forgot...

01:26:23.825 --> 01:26:28.461
that you had the key
in your pocket.

01:26:28.463 --> 01:26:31.063
Do the right thing, John...

01:26:31.065 --> 01:26:34.033
and tell me what you
did with the girl.

01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:37.738
I went to the house,
I was looking for her.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.140
And you got locked in
the surveillance room.

01:26:40.142 --> 01:26:43.043
Exactly. And when I got out,
it was too late.

01:26:43.045 --> 01:26:48.016
And there was blood on the floor in the
hallway, I followed the trail to the forest!

01:26:48.018 --> 01:26:50.218
- And that's how you got the
blood on your shoes? - Yes.

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:55.089
By following the trail of blood from a
16 year-old... in a massive forest.

01:26:55.091 --> 01:26:59.595
Yes, and... she came
out of nowhere.

01:26:59.597 --> 01:27:05.935
She... she grabbed my hands, my
hands had blood on them.

01:27:05.937 --> 01:27:09.338
She ran away.

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:12.142
And was this before or after
she called 911 on her cell...

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:17.347
screaming and crying that you were chasing
her through the house, trying to kill her?

01:27:17.349 --> 01:27:19.649
There is plenty of
evidence to convict you.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:23.653
There was someone else there.

01:27:23.655 --> 01:27:26.424
You're gonna die in jail.

01:27:40.941 --> 01:27:44.877
And coming back... now.

01:28:07.702 --> 01:28:11.572
<i>End of move, end of move!</i>

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.547
Okay, that's it.

01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:22.517
We visited all the necessary
memories together...

01:28:22.519 --> 01:28:27.490
through every aspect of your
involvement in Anna's case.

01:28:27.492 --> 01:28:30.226
I should have realized
what she was doing.

01:28:30.228 --> 01:28:32.495
It's not your fault, John.

01:28:32.497 --> 01:28:35.898
Anna was able to study our protocols
during your time with her...

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.703
and she eventually became strong enough
to control and manipulate the sessions.

01:28:39.705 --> 01:28:46.143
She was even able to figure out that water
triggered the memories of your wife's suicide.

01:28:46.145 --> 01:28:48.545
She needed you to be
responsible for her death.

01:28:48.547 --> 01:28:53.384
If she just ran away, her parents
would just keep searching for her.

01:28:53.386 --> 01:28:56.054
Did you find anything?

01:28:56.056 --> 01:28:58.156
I'll submit our sessions
to the judge...

01:28:58.158 --> 01:29:01.392
specifically highlighting the time you
were locked in the surveillance room...

01:29:01.394 --> 01:29:03.561
and when you spoke to
her in the forest...

01:29:03.563 --> 01:29:07.466
but as you know, our sessions don't
yet carry the same weight...

01:29:07.468 --> 01:29:09.969
as eye witness testimony in court.

01:29:09.971 --> 01:29:14.540
The only irrefutable evidence you could
have is proving Anna's still out there...

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:18.511
but... that's something
beyond my capabilities.

01:29:20.582 --> 01:29:23.116
Mr. Lundgren?

01:29:45.675 --> 01:29:48.210
I'm so sorry.

01:29:48.212 --> 01:29:52.147
I don't know how she
made me believe her.

01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:54.650
She had me completely fooled.

01:29:58.222 --> 01:30:00.490
It's all good, John.

01:30:00.492 --> 01:30:03.459
You've been under a lot
of pressure lately.

01:30:03.461 --> 01:30:05.261
Thank you.

01:30:05.263 --> 01:30:09.400
The judge is gonna consider
Peter's testimony for sure...

01:30:09.402 --> 01:30:11.535
but since you both
work for Mindscape...

01:30:11.537 --> 01:30:15.539
there are some legal issues we need
to get over and that'll take time.

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:16.807
I know.

01:30:16.809 --> 01:30:20.211
Now... the sooner you get rid
of the house the better.

01:30:20.213 --> 01:30:23.448
It won't take long before
the bail will be granted.

01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:26.751
But don't worry, John,
you're not alone.

01:30:26.753 --> 01:30:30.855
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to help you get clear of this.

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:09.298
And you just want to
send a single rose?

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.735
A single rose and...
this photograph.

01:31:17.807 --> 01:31:21.978
Would you be so kind as to remove all
the thorns, before sending it over?

01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.814
You can count on it, yeah.

01:31:44.035 --> 01:31:46.103
<i>The funny thing about memory...</i>

01:31:46.105 --> 01:31:48.840
is that it can't be fully trusted.

01:31:55.848 --> 01:32:01.921
<i>And yet, in the end, it's
the only truth we have.</i>

01:32:01.923 --> 01:32:07.126
<i>And no matter how painful it is,
you gotta look at the truth...</i>

01:32:07.128 --> 01:32:09.495
because sometimes...

01:32:09.497 --> 01:32:12.599
it's the only thing
that can save you.

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:18.105
It's the only thing...

01:32:18.107 --> 01:32:21.241
that can set you free.

01:32:39.896 --> 01:32:42.932
I just thought I'd...

01:32:42.934 --> 01:32:45.467
try to come up so you could say no.

01:32:47.137 --> 01:32:49.206
Come in.
