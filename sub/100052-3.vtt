WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:14.144
You're training
to be a priest?
I am.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.798
Also, an assessor.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.278
My colleague Ben and I are hired

00:17.321 --> 00:18.888
by the Church to investigate

00:18.931 --> 00:19.758
unexplained phenomenon,

00:19.802 --> 00:21.238
and to recommend whether

00:21.282 --> 00:23.197
there should be an exorcism
or further research.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.590
Possession looks a lot
like insanity.

00:25.634 --> 00:28.376
Insanity looks a lot
like possession.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.397
I need someone to help me
distinguish between the two.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.770
I don't believe in all that.

00:31.814 --> 00:32.771
Devils and possession.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.164
That's okay.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.861
You don't care
that I don't believe?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.254
I do not.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.039
We came into
an opportunity overnight.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.998
Another forensic psychologist.
You're just gonna overturn

00:42.042 --> 00:43.869
everything I did
on those two cases?

00:43.913 --> 00:47.221
Argue to release the guilty,
imprison the innocent? Yeah.

00:47.264 --> 00:50.137
Here's the most important thing
to remember about David:

00:50.180 --> 00:52.922
he sells himself
as this good man,

00:52.965 --> 00:55.925
but ask him about
the second time he saw God.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.840
This guy Townsend, you know him?

00:57.883 --> 00:59.798
- I've seen him.
- In other... guises.

00:59.842 --> 01:03.193
I'm sorry. Am I
distracting you?

01:06.936 --> 01:09.069
There are six types
of possession.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.722
First is demonic possession.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.637
It's when a demon takes over
a person's body

01:12.681 --> 01:13.856
without their consent.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.205
It's what you see
in most movies.

01:15.249 --> 01:18.121
It involves speaking in tongues,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.905
sudden personality changes,
sudden violence,

01:19.949 --> 01:21.342
even superhuman strength.

01:23.692 --> 01:26.651
The next type of possession
is physical pain.

01:26.695 --> 01:29.176
This is a sickness
or an injury due to a demon

01:29.219 --> 01:30.525
being inside a person.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.876
It doesn't impact the soul,
just the body.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.139
The third
is diabolic oppression.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.185
This is when a demon torments
a person,

01:38.228 --> 01:40.361
causing tragic events
in their lives...

01:40.404 --> 01:42.232
The loss of a loved one,

01:42.276 --> 01:44.147
the loss of a job,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.366
a home.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.281
Basically, the story of Job.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.458
The fourth type of possession
is diabolical infestation.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.069
It's when demonic entities
take over a house,

01:53.113 --> 01:54.679
an object,

01:54.723 --> 01:57.291
even an animal.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.554
Fifth is diabolical subjugation.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.382
It's when the possessed
invites the demon

02:01.425 --> 02:03.166
into their lives.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.733
They do this through game play

02:04.776 --> 02:06.430
or pledging their soul
to the devil.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.779
That's a real thing?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.389
People pledging their souls?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.392
It's real in that if a human
wants power,

02:11.435 --> 02:14.395
they can trade away their future
for that power.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.502
Oh, so you mean it as metaphor?

02:15.526 --> 02:17.267
No, I think a lot
of what we consider

02:17.311 --> 02:19.356
metaphor is real.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.404
Are you texting?

02:23.447 --> 02:24.492
No, I'm taking notes.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.363
Um, and the last
kind of possession?

02:26.407 --> 02:27.930
That's why we're here.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.845
The monsignor wants us to look
into a case

02:29.888 --> 02:31.412
of diabolical obsession.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.022
It's when a person has constant,

02:33.065 --> 02:34.893
overwhelming
and irrational thoughts,

02:34.937 --> 02:36.678
making them act
in perverse ways.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.724
It's hard to detect because
it's the most

02:39.768 --> 02:41.683
highly functional
of all the possessions.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.859
But it can lead to
suicidal ideation.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.252
And murder.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.446
I mean,
couldn't all these conditions

02:46.470 --> 02:48.168
have a psychological
explanation?

02:48.211 --> 02:51.258
Sure. That's why you're here.

02:51.301 --> 02:54.435
Ready? Yep. I'm ready.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.613
He wasn't like this before.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.093
I mean, he's always been
hard on us, cruel even,

03:01.137 --> 03:04.271
but he's become... violent.

03:04.314 --> 03:07.361
I don't know what to do.
We've tried everything:

03:07.404 --> 03:09.580
therapy, pills, So... Sorry,
I-I don't understand.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.409
Is this your husband? Oh, no.
He's my boss.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.195
Patti is one of our
best parishioners.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.434
I told her we could
look into it. BEN: So you think your boss

03:17.458 --> 03:19.155
is possessed?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.637
I think he does things
he can't control. DAVID: Such as...?

03:24.247 --> 03:26.249
I said to charge it overnight!

03:26.293 --> 03:29.513
This is a lemon poppyseed!
I said blueberry!

03:29.557 --> 03:32.647
I hate fine point!

03:32.690 --> 03:35.040
Medium heavy!

03:35.084 --> 03:38.261
Well, he's fired 67 assistants
in the last six months,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.568
and I have a collection
of cell phones because

03:40.611 --> 03:41.873
he's constantly throwing them.

03:41.917 --> 03:45.355
Patti, I understand
this is unpleasant,

03:45.399 --> 03:47.357
but this doesn't sound
like possession.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.446
It feels like you should be
calling human resources.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.536
Yeah. Well, we're under 50 employees.
We don't have an HR.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.496
Why don't you quit? Well, I hired all
the assistants,

03:55.539 --> 03:57.324
and I feel responsible.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.977
I mean, I believe in the work.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.283
What is the work?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.893
I work for Byron Duke.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.374
The Broadway producer? Yes.

04:04.418 --> 04:08.509
Oh, my God. He's great.
My daughters and I,

04:08.552 --> 04:10.772
we saw the Roald Dahl
musical last year.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.992
It was just... it was amazing. Thank you.
I could get you tickets

04:14.036 --> 04:15.298
for the next one if you want.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.125
Oh, I would want.
That would be great.

04:17.168 --> 04:18.649
Yes, please. Please, yes.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.695
So you can see why
this matters to me.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.738
He's a genius.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.393
Yeah. He is.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.588
I mean, he's always had issues,

04:24.612 --> 04:26.788
but six months ago,
something happened.

04:26.831 --> 04:30.487
He lost the Tony
and he became angrier.

04:30.531 --> 04:33.403
And then things started
to happen.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.536
What kind of things?

04:37.407 --> 04:38.800
Show them the video.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.761
No! Oh, go to hell.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.894
I said go to hell!

04:45.937 --> 04:49.376
No! No, we have got a deal
with the estate, not with you.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.552
What is that?

04:51.595 --> 04:53.380
What is that? KORECKI: Blood.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.730
He's sweating blood.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.994
Also, whenever he enters the
office, it gets colder.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.450
The temperature drops,
like, ten degrees,

05:00.474 --> 05:01.997
and we all have to wear jackets.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.522
And I keep on checking the
thermostat but it's unchanged.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.438
And then when he leaves,
it gets warmer again.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.353
Two physical manifestations.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.486
We only need two
for the Church to act.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.403
Fiona, hi, it's Kristen.
What's up?

05:16.446 --> 05:18.796
They reversed you. They? Who?

05:18.840 --> 05:21.059
This new forensic psychologist.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.844
He reversed your conclusions.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.499
I thought this was settled
weeks ago when you testified.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.502
You said my son was too young
to be tried as an adult!

05:28.545 --> 05:30.373
Well, he is. He's only 15.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.419
This new guy's
saying the opposite!

05:32.462 --> 05:35.639
They're gonna
crucify him, Kristen.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.511
Please help me.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.513
Okay, I'll see you
in ten minutes.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.881
It's a case of anger
management, Monsignor.

05:40.905 --> 05:41.906
Not possession.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.168
Then you'll find that out.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.170
You said yourself,
the Church keeps

05:45.214 --> 05:46.694
focusing on Evil
with a capital "E,"

05:46.737 --> 05:48.391
and not everyday evils.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.089
Well... here's
everyday evil.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.135
Help her.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.400
So it's your recommendation

05:57.444 --> 06:00.185
that Adam Plemmons should be
tried not as a minor,

06:00.229 --> 06:02.666
but as an adult? Yes. The
defendant's score on

06:02.710 --> 06:06.191
the MMPI-A questionnaire
reflected average

06:06.235 --> 06:09.281
or above average
cognitive functioning.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.718
I have to ask you,
Dr. Townsend,

06:10.761 --> 06:13.590
because if I don't,
the defense attorney will.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.593
Your findings are diametrically
opposed to those

06:16.637 --> 06:18.508
of the previous
forensic psychologist.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.423
How do you account for that?

06:20.467 --> 06:23.600
I cannot account for
my predecessor's conclusions.

06:23.644 --> 06:27.299
I do know that
she has a tendency

06:27.343 --> 06:29.824
to let her heart lead her head,

06:29.867 --> 06:32.479
and I think that she was moved

06:32.522 --> 06:34.524
by the mother of the accused.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.613
â™ª

06:36.657 --> 06:39.094
Ms. Jacobs. What do you need?

06:39.137 --> 06:41.052
I want to help. It's a little
late, isn't it?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.314
The judge already ruled.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.640
Tell them you have
a rebuttal witness.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.101
You're bound by your agreement
with the D.A.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.190
You can't testify. I'm not testifying

06:48.233 --> 06:50.671
about the case; I'm testifying
about Dr. Townsend.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.728
Look, I promised to give you
20 minutes so Patti

07:04.772 --> 07:06.513
doesn't drop a â™ªMeToo
dime on me.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.733
So you think you're vulnerable
to the â™ªMeToo issues?

07:09.777 --> 07:11.082
I didn't say that.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.563
Hey, there's a reason
Harvey Weinstein went down.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.522
I-I don't use sex,
and I'm much more talented.

07:15.565 --> 07:16.784
Who's this?

07:16.827 --> 07:18.438
Kristen Bouchard.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.850
Ah, if you're really
Patti's church people,

07:19.874 --> 07:21.441
say some prayers,

07:21.484 --> 07:23.747
sprinkle some holy water.
Come on, get going, get going.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.140
Is that what you want?

07:25.183 --> 07:27.142
What I want is for you
to get this over with

07:27.185 --> 07:29.361
so I can roll my calls, huh?

07:29.405 --> 07:32.016
Do I have anger issues?
Maybe.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.150
But I'm a perfectionist.
I-I'm a demanding person.

07:35.193 --> 07:38.196
And I am surrounded
by millennial nonentities.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.415
Here, look, look.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.331
Two spaces after every period.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.247
How many times do I have
to tell them, one!

07:45.290 --> 07:47.031
Does it matter? Everything matters.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.120
Perfection matters!

07:49.164 --> 07:51.209
Patti said, uh, something
changed six months ago,

07:51.253 --> 07:52.559
when you lost an award.

07:52.602 --> 07:56.432
An award? Oh, holy God!
The Tony!

07:56.476 --> 07:59.391
So, you didchange.No.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.611
I decided that, uh,
rule number 14 made sense:

08:01.655 --> 08:04.614
"Be volatile and torture
your underlings."

08:04.658 --> 08:06.181
Rule number 14 of...?

08:06.224 --> 08:08.313
"The 53 Rules of Dominance."

08:10.315 --> 08:13.710
Ah. Oh, now...

08:13.754 --> 08:15.364
now we are getting somewhere.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.626
You follow it, too, huh?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.106
I know it.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.282
A manual for
hard-driving executives.

08:20.325 --> 08:24.025
"How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Caring."Mm-hmm. Well,

08:24.068 --> 08:25.655
if you know it,
then you know it's not evil.

08:25.679 --> 08:26.723
And what Patti,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.551
in her sweet little
religious heart,

08:28.595 --> 08:30.727
thinks is evil, is just plain

08:30.771 --> 08:34.601
good sense.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.864
You're kind of making
me nervous back here.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.648
You got some blood
on your collar there.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.258
What are you, a dry cleaner?

08:40.302 --> 08:41.956
Go sit down. You're sweating blood.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.238
Why are you sweating blood? What the hell
are you talking about?

08:44.261 --> 08:45.568
Did you have that checked out?

08:45.612 --> 08:48.571
It doesn't need checking.: Oh, my God.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.835
He's going bald.

08:51.879 --> 08:55.535
Get the hell out of my office!

08:55.578 --> 08:58.015
He has hair plugs.
They've become infected,

08:58.059 --> 08:59.582
so he should go to a doctor.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.105
And otherwise, he's got

09:01.149 --> 09:03.064
a narcissistic
personality disorder.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.781
We'll point you toward some
health professionals,

09:04.805 --> 09:07.503
but we don't see any
signs of possession.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.810
Patti?

09:09.853 --> 09:12.377
Can you look at this?

09:12.421 --> 09:14.597
No! I have access to his
webcam so I can track

09:14.641 --> 09:16.164
his blood sugar levels
during meetings.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.644
God, this is your fault!

09:17.687 --> 09:20.385
Who is he talking to?

09:20.429 --> 09:22.431
They know it's you!

09:22.474 --> 09:23.843
This is going on
right now? PATTI: Mm-hmm.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.261
It's in his inner office.

09:27.828 --> 09:31.440
No!

09:31.483 --> 09:35.792
Let go!
Let go or I'll kill you.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.708
Damn you, Joe!

09:38.752 --> 09:40.667
â™ª

09:53.331 --> 09:56.508
A diabolical obsession? We don't know.
He seems like he's just a bad boss.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.728
But we saw him yelling
and fighting with something.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.382
But we don't know what.

10:00.425 --> 10:03.298
Did you have a health care
professional there? Yes.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.232
She thought it was narcissistic
personality disorder,

10:05.256 --> 10:07.389
but then she saw the
video of him fighting.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.651
She's not sure.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.393
So there's video. No, just a webcam.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.873
Not recorded.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.136
Well, then record it.

10:15.179 --> 10:19.096
I've got three exorcisms
in the next two weeks.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.247
I'll need evidence
to justify work

10:20.271 --> 10:22.230
on a mere diabolical obsession.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.189
Understood.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.452
David.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.193
Come here.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.810
There's something else.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.817
I had another vision.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.993
What?

10:47.908 --> 10:50.432
I've been hearing
about "the sixty."

10:50.475 --> 10:52.956
In assessments.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.133
It's some kind of coordination.

10:56.177 --> 11:00.007
Evil becoming organized.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.444
And I thought I saw
something in my vision.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.927
But now it's just a feeling.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.758
Write it down.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.325
Get a notebook, and write down
everything you can remember.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.718
Everything.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.304
As soon as you
write down the first thing,

11:17.328 --> 11:19.853
the next will follow,
and the next.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.463
Symbols matter.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.725
This is warfare,

11:22.769 --> 11:25.075
and we're fighting
the worst enemy on earth,

11:25.119 --> 11:27.861
whose only vulnerability
is that they reveal themselves

11:27.904 --> 11:29.558
in symbols and numbers.

11:29.601 --> 11:32.343
They can't help it.

11:32.387 --> 11:35.390
God draws in straight lines.

11:35.433 --> 11:39.350
The devil draws in puzzles
and anagrams.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.743
Write it down?

11:40.787 --> 11:44.442
Write it down.
Visions matter.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.983
â™ª Oh, Lydia, oh, Lydia

12:03.026 --> 12:05.333
â™ª Say, have you met Lydia?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.510
â™ª Lydia, the tattooed lady

12:08.553 --> 12:13.210
â™ª She has eyes
that men adore so â™ª

12:13.254 --> 12:15.647
â™ª And a torso even more so.

12:28.573 --> 12:33.143
Ah, now we're getting somewhere.

12:33.187 --> 12:36.494
Yes. Sexy.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.410
No, no, do the breasts bigger.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.288
What does he even mean,

12:47.331 --> 12:50.987
"We reveal ourselves
through symbol and anagram"?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.815
I hate anagrams.
I like straight talk.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.557
Don't you, David?

12:55.600 --> 12:59.648
Can't we, you and I,
just straight talk?

13:02.956 --> 13:06.437
Anger management.
We all get angry.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.744
But when you feel
a temper fit coming on,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.355
what do you do?

13:11.399 --> 13:12.748
Personify it.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.446
Personify your anger.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.797
This is Paul.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.190
He's the personification
of my anger.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.627
Whenever I get angry,
I blame him.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.631
I know, I know, but it works.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.852
I take a deep breath,
and I realize I'm not angry,

13:29.896 --> 13:31.680
Paul is angry.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.595
And I subdue him.

13:33.638 --> 13:37.381
I yell, "Paul, it's your fault.
Yours!"

13:37.425 --> 13:39.470
I even take Paul by the throat.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.517
Paul, you will not control me.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.998
I will control you.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.174
Kristen.

13:47.217 --> 13:50.264
Thank you for returning, Doctor.
No problem.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.702
Um...

13:56.139 --> 13:58.489
Mr. Townsend...

13:58.533 --> 14:00.013
Excuse me, Dr. Townsend...

14:00.056 --> 14:02.450
It's already been established
that you disagree

14:02.493 --> 14:05.453
with the conclusions
of your predecessor. That is correct.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.324
And I see she's
in court right now.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.761
Could you point her out? Yes.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.894
Um, Kristen Bouchard.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.592
And why shouldn't we
take her word over yours?

14:14.636 --> 14:16.943
Objection! This was covered
in yesterday's testimony.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.529
Yes, but we have new
evidence the doctor

14:18.553 --> 14:19.791
would like to impart,
Your Honor.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.209
Yeah, it's a pretrial
hearing, Ms. Jacobs.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.775
You'll have time to cross.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.473
Were you not passed evidence

14:25.516 --> 14:28.476
that made you question
Ms. Bouchard's legal ethics?

14:29.564 --> 14:30.739
Yes, I'm sorry to say.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.349
Ms. Bouchard is in therapy

14:32.393 --> 14:34.961
for... personal issues.

14:35.004 --> 14:38.573
But an anonymous Good Samaritan
sent me therapy notes...

14:38.616 --> 14:40.444
Objection!
Therapy notes

14:40.488 --> 14:42.403
are covered
by physician-patient privilege.

14:42.446 --> 14:43.926
Only if Ms. Bouchard

14:43.970 --> 14:45.188
is the accused.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.581
She's being proposed

14:46.624 --> 14:47.930
as an expert witness,
Your Honor.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.585
Her reliability is in question,
and these notes

14:50.628 --> 14:51.760
undercut that reliability.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.588
All right,
let me hear the evidence,

14:53.631 --> 14:54.763
and then I'll rule.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.417
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.638
If I put you on the stand,
what are you gonna say?

15:00.682 --> 15:03.685
That Adam should be tried
as a juvenile. That's not what I'm asking,

15:03.728 --> 15:05.271
and you know that's
not what I'm asking.

15:05.295 --> 15:08.516
Look, I've said things in
therapy that are personal and...

15:08.559 --> 15:10.735
prospective... they weren't true.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.607
They were potentialities. But you said

15:12.650 --> 15:15.305
that you were attracted to these
people that you interviewed?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.525
I said I had feelings.
I mean, feelings as in I...

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
I care for them, I...

15:19.005 --> 15:20.745
like them.Okay.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.617
So I need you to step back
from this.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.618
I can refute Dr. Townsend.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.881
No. You've been burned.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.797
I need you to step back.

15:56.825 --> 16:00.263
I don't know what the hell
you are talking about.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.743
Let them help you, Byron.

16:01.786 --> 16:06.313
You are so past your
sell-by date, Patti.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.445
Who is Joe? BYRON:
What are you talking about?

16:08.489 --> 16:12.014
We saw you yesterday yelling
at someone called Joe.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.190
I don't know a Joe!

16:14.234 --> 16:16.236
You're gaslighting me.
You got to stop.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.194
You're personifying your anger.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.631
What?

16:20.675 --> 16:22.894
You gave your anger
the name "Joe,"

16:22.938 --> 16:24.635
and you're trying to subdue it.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.681
It's an anger management tool.

16:26.724 --> 16:30.032
I have no idea what
you're talking about. KRISTEN: Listen,

16:30.076 --> 16:33.079
you want us out of here, just
admit it's anger management.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.820
Who the hell are you, lady?

16:35.864 --> 16:37.102
Somebody who enjoys your shows,

16:37.126 --> 16:39.476
but thinks you're being
a bit of a dick.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.826
Genius doesn't mean you can
treat people any way you want.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.655
It means shutting up
and doing good work.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.314
You are so dead.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.056
What?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.841
You're dead.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.887
â™ª

17:03.370 --> 17:05.372
Why are we dead?

17:07.374 --> 17:09.202
Tell 'em, Joe.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.987
Come on, there is no
Joe, just admit it.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.032
It's just you. Tell 'em, Joe.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.036
I am the buyer of souls.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.996
And yours only cost a Tony.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.884
Joe?

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
Hello.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.805
Someone is hacking him. You're sure?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.416
This is my world.
Welcome to it.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.895
It's a virtual assistant.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.072
It's supposed to have
a programmed voice,

17:53.115 --> 17:56.292
but the hacker is broadcasting
from the outside interactively.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.599
Can a thermostat
also be controlled?

17:58.642 --> 18:01.080
Yes. Yes. Yes, because it's got
smart-home technology,

18:01.123 --> 18:03.821
so it can make the temperature
go up and down.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.477
Th-That's why it keeps getting
cold every time he arrives.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.349
Who did this? And the problem is,

18:09.392 --> 18:10.785
he's got a lot of enemies.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.135
67 fired assistants
over six months.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.920
Look, I think the hacker
is using the Wi-Fi, okay?

18:15.964 --> 18:17.357
I need you to keep him online.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.011
I'm gonna find out his IP.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.189
Hello?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.108
Hello.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.591
What do you want?

18:34.635 --> 18:36.463
What do you want?

18:38.160 --> 18:41.816
You've gone to great effort
to talk to Mr. Duke.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.557
So what do you want from him?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.559
What do you want from him?

18:45.602 --> 18:49.171
You know it's an easy thing
just to turn you off.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.174
It's an easy thing
to turn you off.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.003
Okay.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.744
It won't matter.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.833
We don't need an "on" button.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.577
Who's "we"?

19:03.620 --> 19:06.362
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.495
So you've been turning
the thermostat down

19:08.538 --> 19:10.540
when Mr. Duke enters
the office?

19:10.584 --> 19:13.543
Yes. And I control
the sun and the moon.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.806
Very clever of you
to figure that out.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.465
It's coming from the
coffee shop downstairs.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.468
I need you to go down there,
and in about five minutes,

19:25.512 --> 19:27.862
I'm gonna emit a
high-pitched tone into it.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.907
Let me know who reacts.Okay.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.954
You must want something.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.784
Fun. Isn't that what
we all want, David?

19:36.827 --> 19:39.352
You heard my name?

19:39.395 --> 19:41.092
"Diabolical obsession," huh?

19:41.136 --> 19:43.921
It sounds made up.

19:43.965 --> 19:47.229
So you don't think Mr. Duke
is diabolically obsessed?

19:47.273 --> 19:50.798
No. I think you're
diabolically obsessed.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.368
How many people are
on computers?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.805
About... 20.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.763
Any gamer headsets? One.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.983
And, uh, earbuds? Seven.

20:02.026 --> 20:02.897
No, wait. Eight.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.420
Okay, focus on them.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.041
Nothing.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.042
No reaction.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.306
Ah. 105 decibels.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.959
I'm terrified, Ben.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.224
Hold on.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.271
So, have you
been investigating us?

20:29.315 --> 20:31.447
You seem to know our names.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.058
I'm gonna turn off the Wi-Fi
for about 15 minutes.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.987
Hell is 3,400 miles
from New York.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.338
There are tolls on these routes.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.003
So, is that a prank?

21:06.047 --> 21:08.092
Well, we don't know.

21:08.136 --> 21:11.052
Mr. Duke has fired 67 assistants
over the last year,

21:11.095 --> 21:13.881
and one of them may have hacked
his virtual assistant.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.884
So then, we're moving on?

21:16.927 --> 21:18.407
David?

21:18.451 --> 21:20.279
You seem uncomfortable.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.281
Well, our tech advisor
can't tell

21:22.324 --> 21:26.110
who or how the device
was hacked.

21:26.154 --> 21:29.897
And the voices that are coming
out of it are, um, bizarre.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.775
It's odd, David living here.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.125
Yeah. Doesn't seem
like him, right?

21:48.481 --> 21:49.960
They want us
to keep working on it.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.135
Yes. Any thoughts

21:51.179 --> 21:53.181
on how the hacker did it? Oh, yeah.

21:53.224 --> 21:56.184
I think he's using
Bluetooth, not Wi-Fi.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.491
So, I am gonna try
to reverse the hack

21:58.534 --> 22:00.057
with a trap.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.669
Hmm. Just be careful.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.975
Okay, but why? About what?

22:06.194 --> 22:08.457
Well, I don't know
what we're dealing with.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.375
We're dealing with a hacker.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.905
Little side hobby here?

22:21.949 --> 22:25.256
No, I'm trying
to decipher something

22:25.300 --> 22:27.911
in my dreams.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.088
Can I ask you
a personal question? Sure.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.090
Do the scandals bother you?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.834
You mean the Church scandals?

22:37.878 --> 22:40.968
Yes. A lot.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.060
But how can you...

22:46.103 --> 22:47.888
Why become a priest?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.809
I believe in God.

22:55.852 --> 22:59.465
And I believe God wants me
to become a priest.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.859
And their treatment of gays?

23:02.903 --> 23:04.861
Do you agree with that?

23:04.905 --> 23:06.646
No.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.170
Does this bother you,
talking about it?

23:09.213 --> 23:11.215
No.It's just,

23:11.259 --> 23:13.217
there's so many things
wrong with the Church.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.828
That's... That's one of the reasons

23:14.871 --> 23:17.091
we need good people.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.528
And you don't mind...

23:23.010 --> 23:25.839
all that it requires of you?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.712
I mind.

23:29.756 --> 23:33.237
But I also think that the most
important things in life

23:33.281 --> 23:35.414
are the hardest to obtain.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.468
Sometimes I just wonder
what you're about. Uh...

23:48.078 --> 23:51.517
I-I was embedded
with six Marines.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.475
And I was surprised

23:53.519 --> 23:57.218
how much I... loved them.

23:57.261 --> 24:01.091
Their sense of commitment.

24:01.135 --> 24:04.007
You know, I spent most of my
life breaking commitments.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.140
Moving from one place
to another,

24:06.183 --> 24:09.273
one person to another.

24:09.317 --> 24:13.147
And I realized I
didn't like myself.

24:13.190 --> 24:16.150
These guys were
the first ones in the building

24:16.193 --> 24:18.718
and the last ones out of it.

24:18.761 --> 24:21.503
And I wanted to be that.

24:21.547 --> 24:25.507
I wanted that level
of commitment.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.125
I was just, uh,
turning the light on.Yeah.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.519
I was gonna leave anyway.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.130
I-I like talking to you.

24:41.218 --> 24:44.526
Me, too. With you.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.531
Oh, by the way, that sketch?

24:49.575 --> 24:51.577
I think it's Salvator Mundi.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.361
It's what?

24:53.404 --> 24:54.362
Salvator Mundi,

24:54.405 --> 24:56.320
the painting by da Vinci.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.825
Nipples.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.874
Climax.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.225
Curve of the breasts.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.533
Pressing against her.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.015
Before,

25:39.059 --> 25:43.280
behind, between.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.283
Above,

25:46.327 --> 25:48.285
below.

25:56.772 --> 25:59.296
What are you doing? Geez! Don't do that.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.602
How'd you get in?

26:00.646 --> 26:03.344
Oh, God. Um, I still have a key.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.954
Where's Dad? Sleeping.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.391
What's that?

26:07.435 --> 26:09.002
You gave Dad one already.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.394
I know.
This is for work.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.179
Your work with your priest?

26:12.222 --> 26:13.615
Yes, with my priest.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.791
How do you broadcast from this
without using Wi-Fi?

26:15.835 --> 26:18.141
Bluetooth. No, I already scanned it

26:18.185 --> 26:19.465
for a Bluetooth signal.Cellular.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.710
Nope, it's not cellular-enabled.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.233
Can be adapted.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.497
Really? How?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.761
I hate how you do this.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.458
I am in the middle of my work

26:30.501 --> 26:32.678
and you pull me into one
of your stupid things.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.596
How can it be adapted?

26:39.467 --> 26:41.251
Leland!

26:41.295 --> 26:43.384
Leland.

26:43.427 --> 26:45.299
You forgot your notes.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.303
Oh, Kristen.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.305
Can't stay away from me,
can you?

26:51.348 --> 26:54.395
What do you want? Why are
you doing this to Adam?

26:54.438 --> 26:57.398
What good could it
possibly do you? Young Adam

26:57.441 --> 27:01.445
is 140 pounds of wet clay
yet to find its form.

27:01.489 --> 27:05.449
Adult prison will mold the man
he is to become.

27:05.493 --> 27:09.279
Harden him, harden his heart,

27:09.323 --> 27:12.326
make him more...

27:12.369 --> 27:14.981
susceptible.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.287
Susceptible to what?

27:17.331 --> 27:18.898
Ask David.

27:18.941 --> 27:22.728
I want my therapist's notes
back. The ones you stole.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.381
Oh, I think not.

27:24.425 --> 27:27.123
They make for such
wonderful bedtime reading.

27:27.167 --> 27:30.474
Why don't you just get back on
the stand and tell the truth?

27:30.518 --> 27:34.391
This is so sad, you coming here
thinking you could, what?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.306
Play on my better nature?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.004
Is that really your plan?

27:38.047 --> 27:39.353
Look, he's just a kid.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.790
His second prison rape
and he won't be.

27:41.834 --> 27:45.446
If you knew what
you were playing with,

27:45.489 --> 27:48.405
Kristen, you would be
staying at home

27:48.449 --> 27:51.713
and protecting
those cute little girls.

28:03.507 --> 28:04.987
Anything in there?

28:05.031 --> 28:07.250
Wires.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.513
Really? Thank you. I don't know.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.211
This is all looking
pretty pristine.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.604
I don't think it's been
tampered with. Then, what?

28:13.648 --> 28:15.563
I don't know.
You should take it back there

28:15.606 --> 28:16.607
and check the signals.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.871
Or?

28:18.914 --> 28:20.873
Or what? I don't know.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.572
Sounded like you were about
to say, "Or..." something smart.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.444
No, I wasn't. I was just...

28:30.447 --> 28:32.362
Is Dad awake?

28:34.190 --> 28:37.803
Hello. What are you wearing?

28:41.632 --> 28:44.113
Hello?

28:44.157 --> 28:46.463
You are getting warmer.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.554
That's Dad's.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.734
You are red hot, Ben.

28:59.912 --> 29:02.653
The Crimean Bridge
is the longest span in Europe.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.656
It is 19,000 meters long
and was built in 2018.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.310
Who is this?

29:07.354 --> 29:11.488
"This" is the singular
proximal demonstrative pronoun

29:11.532 --> 29:14.927
used to identify a specific
person or thing close at hand

29:14.970 --> 29:17.843
or being indicated
or experienced.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.542
This hacker's good. Yeah,

29:21.585 --> 29:23.805
but how did he jump
to Dad's virtual assistant?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.827
The only active connection
is you, your cell phone.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.593
Yeah. Oh, so he used
Byron's virtual assistant,

29:29.637 --> 29:33.684
scanned for nearby cell phones,
found mine, hacked me.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.295
It's possible.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.297
Can you reverse-hack?

29:37.340 --> 29:39.168
Oh, yeah.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.395
â™ª

30:16.640 --> 30:18.642
â™ª

30:48.063 --> 30:50.065
â™ª

31:11.217 --> 31:13.480
Thanks. I would've come to you.Hi. No,

31:13.523 --> 31:15.917
my-my sister works better
when she works alone anyway.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.006
Okay, I have an issue
that came up.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.575
I don't want to involve
David in this because

31:21.618 --> 31:23.969
it's a workplace matter and
he'll just want to defend me.

31:24.012 --> 31:26.406
Oh, so instead,
you want me to defend you?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.976
Um...

31:31.019 --> 31:34.109
could you
take a listen?
Yeah.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.806
Ah, Kristen.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.547
Can't stay away from me,
can you?

31:37.591 --> 31:39.941
What do you want? KRISTEN:
Why are you doing this to Adam?

31:41.595 --> 31:45.338
What-what happened? I don't know.

31:45.381 --> 31:48.819
My voice comes through,
the other person doesn't.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.954
Susceptible to what?

31:55.609 --> 31:57.176
I want my therapist's
notes back,

31:57.219 --> 31:58.960
the ones you stole.Hmm.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.963
Sounds like the other
person used a jammer.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.965
Can you dig it out?

32:04.009 --> 32:06.881
Yeah. Send it to me.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.839
I'll see what I can do.Great.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.103
Thank you.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.237
â™ª Where I'm going

32:15.281 --> 32:17.457
â™ª When the whistle blows

32:17.500 --> 32:19.546
â™ª And the cymbals crash

32:19.589 --> 32:21.069
â™ª And the sparklers

32:21.113 --> 32:23.071
â™ª Light the sky...

32:23.115 --> 32:26.031
He's been like this all morning.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.859
â™ª I'm gonna carry on,
give me an old trombone... â™ª

32:28.903 --> 32:31.079
Mr. Duke? Hello?

32:31.123 --> 32:34.213
â™ª Before the parade Byron?

32:34.256 --> 32:35.475
Are you okay?

32:35.518 --> 32:37.129
â™ª Passes by...

32:37.172 --> 32:39.348
Do you want to

32:39.392 --> 32:42.264
put some clothes on, Mr. Duke?

32:42.308 --> 32:45.093
Byron?

32:45.137 --> 32:49.228
We don't think you're under
any sort of demonic attack.

32:49.271 --> 32:52.013
We think someone hacked
your machine as a prank.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.059
Do you know anyone
who might've done that?

32:55.408 --> 32:58.063
When we find the hacker,
you'll be back to normal.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.979
â™ª When the whistle blows

33:01.022 --> 33:02.676
â™ª And the symbols crash

33:02.719 --> 33:04.069
â™ª And the sparklers

33:04.112 --> 33:05.287
â™ª Light the sky...

33:15.341 --> 33:16.472
Sebastian Lewin...

33:16.516 --> 33:18.083
Did he service your Wi-Fi?

33:18.126 --> 33:20.041
I think so.
I don't remember his name.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.782
Did Byron fire him?
Why?

33:21.825 --> 33:23.697
Could he have a grudge? Well, Byron decided

33:23.740 --> 33:26.613
to withhold pay so he could be
certain that the work was good.

33:26.656 --> 33:29.398
That part didn't go over well.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.202
So, what'd you find out? There's an
I.T. specialist

33:31.226 --> 33:33.576
that works in the office
by the name of Sebastian Lewin.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.057
Ah, did he work
on his virtual assistant?

33:36.101 --> 33:37.493
Quite possibly.
We're not sure.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.930
What about the hack on your end?

33:39.974 --> 33:42.020
So we are disabling
all the Bluetooth devices,

33:42.063 --> 33:44.022
and the hacker's
only access point

33:44.065 --> 33:46.024
will be my sister's cell phone,

33:46.067 --> 33:49.679
and then she is gonna divert
the hack to the NSA.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.812
The NSA? Why?

33:51.855 --> 33:55.163
To get him in trouble.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.733
Kristen,
do-do you have a minute? Yeah.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.952
So that recording you gave me,

34:01.996 --> 34:04.651
I can't take out
the other voice.

34:04.694 --> 34:05.956
Damn.
I know.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.916
Look, there is another option.

34:08.958 --> 34:13.094
You have his voice from the
first thing he said, right?

34:13.138 --> 34:17.054
So I just sample it
and deepfake it.

34:17.098 --> 34:20.275
What does that mean? Deepfake.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.973
You tell me what you remember
of his side of the conversation,

34:23.016 --> 34:25.106
and I duplicate it.

34:25.150 --> 34:29.110
You duplicate...
You can, you can do that?

34:29.154 --> 34:32.157
Yeah, I can, yeah.

34:34.202 --> 34:38.076
Look, if you don't want to,
it's totally... No, no, I...

34:38.119 --> 34:39.728
You can just create
a conversation?

34:39.773 --> 34:43.342
No, I-I wouldn't be creating it,
I would be recreating it.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.126
Look, it's-it's a conversation

34:45.170 --> 34:48.172
that you had and you lost,
and now you just want it back.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.221
If the ethics
of this throw you...

34:53.264 --> 34:57.269
No, no, I-I want it. I just...

35:02.056 --> 35:03.449
Yes, please do it.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.941
Sebastian Lewin.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.421
Yeah. What's the problem?

35:19.465 --> 35:21.293
That depends.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.950
I was just teaching
him a lesson.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.865
Yeah? By hacking
his virtual assistant?

35:28.909 --> 35:31.955
Yeah. He didn't pay for my work,
so I used his cell phone

35:31.999 --> 35:34.654
to slingshot my voice
onto his machine.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.438
You convinced him
to pledge his soul?
Yeah.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.615
And he believed me.
What a moron.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.531
So, uh, how'd you hack
my virtual assistant at home?

35:42.575 --> 35:44.098
What are you talking about?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.318
Your voice...
It was on my dad's machine.

35:46.361 --> 35:47.884
No.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.757
Yes, it was. I heard it.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.107
No, I stopped a few days ago.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.952
I don't believe you. JOE: Yes, you do.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.084
Iblis has your baby.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.840
What is that about?

36:34.279 --> 36:36.890
Karima.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.240
What is that about a baby?

36:41.286 --> 36:44.114
Karima!

37:10.315 --> 37:12.186
Mr. Duke, I am so sorry.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.579
This is a lemon poppy seed,

37:13.622 --> 37:15.320
and I'm not sure
how that happened...

37:15.363 --> 37:17.452
No, no, no, leave it. I'm fine.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.585
But it's lemon poppy seed.Yes.

37:19.628 --> 37:23.197
I'm expanding my horizons.
Leave it.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.939
You know, this experience has...

37:25.982 --> 37:28.289
Changed me? Oh, God, I hope not.

37:28.333 --> 37:32.032
Oh, whoops,
used the Lord's name in vain.

37:35.165 --> 37:37.385
Do you want me to start
rolling calls?

37:37.429 --> 37:38.908
Please.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.346
Sure.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.180
â™ª Hell is only half full

37:50.224 --> 37:54.010
â™ª Room for you and me

37:54.054 --> 37:57.187
â™ª Looking for a new fool

37:57.231 --> 38:00.930
â™ª Who's it gonna be?

38:00.974 --> 38:04.586
No, he's been good.
Very good, actually.

38:04.630 --> 38:08.329
I'm glad, but call the monsignor
if you have any more issues.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.506
I will. Yes. Oh, and can you
tell your partner

38:11.550 --> 38:14.422
that I have five tickets
for her for the new play?

38:14.466 --> 38:16.424
Thank you all.

38:16.468 --> 38:19.209
It's been a breath
of fresh air here.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.386
He hasn't fired anyone.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.865
He's even talked about hiring

38:22.909 --> 38:25.128
some of the other
assistants back.

38:25.172 --> 38:28.044
Yes. I don't know what you did,

38:28.088 --> 38:31.613
but it's a whole new world
around here.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.535
Ah, Dr. Townsend.

38:40.579 --> 38:43.973
Would you return
to the stand, please?

38:44.017 --> 38:46.236
Of course, Your Honor.

39:02.688 --> 39:03.906
A reminder, Doctor,

39:03.950 --> 39:07.388
you are still
under oath.
May I,

39:07.432 --> 39:09.869
Your Honor?

39:09.912 --> 39:11.610
Ah, Kristen.

39:11.653 --> 39:15.353
Can't stay away from me,
can you?

39:15.396 --> 39:16.484
What do you want to say?

39:16.528 --> 39:18.399
Why are you doing this to Adam?

39:18.443 --> 39:21.184
What good could
it possibly do you?

39:21.228 --> 39:26.015
Adam is a lightweight of clay
yet to find its form.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.235
Real prison will help mold him
into a man.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.585
It'll harden him.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.109
Do you recognize those words?

39:33.153 --> 39:35.329
That is your voice,
Doctor, isn't it?

39:35.373 --> 39:38.288
Again, Your Honor, objection.
This is a secret recording.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.029
Yes, and we are in
a one-party state,

39:40.073 --> 39:41.291
and we are using it to rebut

39:41.335 --> 39:42.771
an expert witness, Your Honor.

39:42.815 --> 39:46.209
Yes, Mr. Cormier, this is merely
a pre-trial hearing.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.126
Dr. Townsend, is
this your voice?

39:50.170 --> 39:53.042
It is not.
Really?

39:53.086 --> 39:54.653
Well, what about this?

39:54.696 --> 39:57.220
Why don't you just
get back on the stand

39:57.264 --> 39:59.353
and tell the truth?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.181
What are you trying to do,

40:01.224 --> 40:03.139
play on my better nature,
Kristen?

40:03.183 --> 40:05.098
Seriously.

40:05.141 --> 40:06.447
Is that really your plan?

40:06.491 --> 40:07.970
Look, he's just a kid.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.894
The second prison rape,
and he won't be anymore.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.369
So, Mr. Townsend,
what do you mean by that?

40:17.458 --> 40:21.157
That's Dr. Townsend.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.856
Thank you, Kristen.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.250
Still a long way to go.

40:27.294 --> 40:30.340
At least we have
a fighting chance now.

40:30.384 --> 40:31.646
Yes.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.083
Thank you so much.

40:38.871 --> 40:42.701
A deepfake... how very modern.
Those are my tools.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.355
What did Shakespeare say?

40:45.399 --> 40:48.489
"To do a great right,
do a little wrong."

40:48.533 --> 40:50.709
Technology's a bitch.

40:53.363 --> 40:55.322
You know the next line?

40:55.365 --> 40:58.760
"And curb this cruel devil
of his will."

40:58.804 --> 41:03.373
There are forces in play,
Kristen Bouchard.
