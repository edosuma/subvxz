WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.211
- Stand back.
- Shocking at 360.

00:03.379 --> 00:05.254
Clear!
You're killing him!

00:05.422 --> 00:07.006
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:07.174 --> 00:10.259
My mom is up for parole
and I'm trying to
help her get out.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.261
I just didn't want
you to think
I was blowing you off.

00:13.806 --> 00:16.391
You don't have to worry.
I'm not going to tell
anybody at work.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.393
This is our thing.
Nobody else's.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.272
You don't get to come back
married and pregnant,
saying that you missed me.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.565
You walked away.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.612
Did you
start that fire?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.155
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.157
Who the hell are you?

00:33.325 --> 00:34.742
What are you
doing with Ernie?

00:34.910 --> 00:36.035
I said, what are you
doing with that kid?

00:36.745 --> 00:40.206
I've never seen anyone
return to full duty
after this surgery.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.333
Renée, she's transferring
to Madrid for her job,

00:42.501 --> 00:43.876
and I found
a great rehab unit.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.169
How long you staying?

00:45.629 --> 00:46.921
I'm moving there.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.808
Oh, no,
no, no, no!

00:58.976 --> 01:00.309
Come on!
No!

01:02.396 --> 01:03.604
Wow.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.982
Do you mind
taking our picture?

01:06.150 --> 01:07.024
Sure.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.655
Apartment fire,

01:12.823 --> 01:14.907
ten-car pile-up,
hand caught in a machine...

01:15.075 --> 01:18.077
Okay, all right.
In Madrid, it is
going to be,

01:18.245 --> 01:20.163
um, tapas, tapas,

01:21.123 --> 01:24.375
dance club and, um,
Catholic church.

01:24.543 --> 01:28.129
You think I can dance?
Well, I can dance
and you can just watch.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.256
That I can do.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.885
You know, I've never
done that before.
Oh, yeah?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.052
Yeah.
Wow.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.972
Well, then I guess this
is going to be the first of
many new things then. Huh?

01:38.140 --> 01:39.223
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.562
What is it?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.192
I met this doctor.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.195
A doctor?
Not like that.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.280
I just, um...

01:55.824 --> 01:58.743
Well, I put out
some feelers
to my medical contacts,

01:58.911 --> 02:04.081
and, um, it turns out
that the chief of orthopedics
over at River Forest Hospital

02:05.959 --> 02:08.336
is pioneering
some kind of experimental
spinal surgery,

02:08.504 --> 02:11.005
and he wants to meet you.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.883
Really?
Yeah.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.846
You know what? Maybe
this will help you get
to Madrid even sooner.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.181
Hmm?

02:25.729 --> 02:27.230
Chief Boden.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.816
Do you remember me?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.151
Ernie.
Yeah.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.862
What's going on?

02:36.031 --> 02:37.323
Are you okay?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.243
No.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.121
Talk to me.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.499
Where are you?

02:49.711 --> 02:57.385
Ernie?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.321
Hardware store? Not good.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.116
Cruz, Mills,
vent the roof.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.244
Hardware stores
got propane tanks,
accelerants...

03:28.333 --> 03:29.542
Go, go, go!

03:32.170 --> 03:35.006
Dispatch, be advised,
Battalion 25 is on the scene.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.383
Copy that, 25.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.011
We got one down.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.554
Herrmann, take his legs.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.693
No pulse.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.236
Not breathing.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.781
Fire's out, Chief.
Looks like another
dumpster fire.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.475
What's up?
Door's jammed.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.187
I told Chief we needed
to grease this puppy
before the weather turned.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.688
And what,
he ignored you?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.274
No. He told me
to do it but I forgot.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.151
I've been
preoccupied.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.153
Weren't you and Cindy
using protection?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.780
We've got
four kids, Mouch.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.699
I was counting on
my sperm being too tired
to make the swim.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.786
Well, I'm going to head inside
and check the levels
on the hot chocolate.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.205
Yeah, I'm going to
provide backup.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.587
You know, my grandmother
had this garage door

04:56.755 --> 04:58.172
that was always stuck
two feet off the ground.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.757
So one time I told my
brother Nick, I said,

04:59.925 --> 05:01.634
"Go inside
and grab some butter."

05:01.802 --> 05:03.970
What?
We got a rule.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.263
You tell a story
that we've all heard
a million times,

05:06.431 --> 05:08.683
and we raise our hand,
you got to shut up,
no questions asked.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.559
Yeah, it's actually
impolite and insulting.

05:10.727 --> 05:11.978
Like that's on us.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.772
I haven't heard the story.
Mills, let's go.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.940
Where you guys going?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.608
I asked Cruz
to give me
driving lesson. So...

05:17.776 --> 05:20.945
I'm actually next in line
to drive 81.
You know that.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.989
Lieutenant?
Not now, Otis.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.828
Hey, I got
this dog here,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.664
if anyone wants it.
Don't even think about it.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.874
We had a dog over at 80
when I was there,

05:34.459 --> 05:36.877
I still have
the teeth marks on
my ankle to prove it.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.047
My dad says he's gonna
throw it in the river
if I don't get rid of it.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.551
I'll take it.
At least I can find a home
for it or something.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.511
He likes bacon.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.888
Well, there's that.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.141
Does he have a name?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.105
Aw, Dad, can we
keep it? Huh?

05:56.273 --> 05:58.649
Can we? Can we? Can we?
Keep what?

05:58.817 --> 05:59.942
The dog.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.448
The kid's dad
was going to drown it
if we didn't take it.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.657
He can't stay.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.872
I got a call that 67
over at Morningside,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.498
they need relief
for the next two shifts.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.208
- I'll do it.
- What?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.085
That's the slowest house
in the city.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.046
I'll do it.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.383
Oh, what the hell?
You've got a medical
furlough, Severide.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.552
That means you're
medically required
to be out drinking.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.387
Yeah, well,

06:29.473 --> 06:30.973
this may be more
than just a furlough.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.603
I'm moving
to Spain with Renée.

06:44.029 --> 06:47.448
Between your history with us
and your father's
distinguished career,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.742
I can get you
Arson Investigation

06:50.160 --> 06:52.453
or the Academy.
Your choice.

06:53.038 --> 06:56.123
I appreciate it, Chief,
I do. But I'm leaving.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.460
Kelly,

07:01.338 --> 07:02.922
just sleep on it.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.550
I have.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.057
Hey, you okay?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.188
You were right about Ernie.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.567
He called, said
he was in trouble,
and then he hung up,

07:23.735 --> 07:26.695
right before we responded
to another dumpster fire.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.866
I don't know
where to find him.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.411
You tried to
help him, Chief.
Did I?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.914
You reached out to him.
You invited him in.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.335
Kelly, I saw him
with this man.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.340
Everything about it
felt wrong.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.634
And you handed
it over to the police.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.970
And what have
they done, huh?
Nothing.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.567
Hey, uh...
I must've misheard Capp

08:04.734 --> 08:06.986
because he said something
about you going to Spain.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.198
Yeah. I was going to
tell you this morning,
but... I missed you.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.909
How long have you known this?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.912
A day? Maybe two?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.251
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.461
425 Lake Street.
Infant shooting.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.060
My baby! My baby's been shot!

08:50.280 --> 08:51.405
Baby!

08:52.908 --> 08:54.241
You called the cops?

08:54.409 --> 08:57.536
You've been shot, baby.
Put down that...

08:57.704 --> 08:59.788
Whoa! Take it easy!

08:59.956 --> 09:01.957
Shut up and stay away from me.

09:08.924 --> 09:09.798
I'm not going back to jail.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.885
We're not the cops.
This was self-defense.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.179
Of course it was.
You stay where you are!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.473
You're going to
shoot me for
helping your mom?

09:17.641 --> 09:18.974
Fire Department!

09:22.354 --> 09:23.395
Tell them to stop banging!

09:23.563 --> 09:25.856
Tell them to stop
or I'm going to blow a hole
right through that door!

09:27.609 --> 09:28.817
Dawson? Shay?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.987
You can't carry a taser!
Yeah, well,
tell that to Baby.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.785
"Baby" here, uh,
cold-cocked his mom

09:37.953 --> 09:40.037
and then tripped
and bumped his head.

09:42.874 --> 09:43.874
Baby.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.550
Where in the
code of conduct book

09:53.718 --> 09:56.136
does it say
you can't carry a taser?

09:56.304 --> 09:59.014
Page one.
Huh, I should totally
read that someday.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.648
Hey, Otis? Remember to bring
some reading materials
with you to Morningside.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.734
Ten bucks you sell more
"Morningside" t-shirts

10:10.902 --> 10:12.778
to tourists
than you get calls.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.363
Wager denied.

10:16.825 --> 10:17.992
Hey, yo, Dawson! Hold up.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.161
Hey.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.580
Yo, I'm sorry about before.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.750
It's just that
on shift it's...
Oh, stop it.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.419
It's all right.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.129
It's just...

10:30.297 --> 10:31.880
You know that
it drives me crazy.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.759
We'll figure it out.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.470
Text me after
you get some rest.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.888
Sounds good.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.691
You want to get breakfast?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.777
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.045
Wow, look at you!
You look like
you're about to pop.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.422
Uh, yeah. 15 more weeks.

11:14.758 --> 11:15.966
Thank you.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.886
I heard that if you
eat eggplant, the baby
comes right out.

11:19.054 --> 11:19.928
I moved out.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.847
What?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.059
I told Daniel it
wasn't going to work.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.769
Ever.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.147
And I, uh...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.983
I moved back in
with my parents.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.819
Wow.
Yeah, I know.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.781
I mean,
it's exactly where I
imagined my life at 30,

11:38.948 --> 11:41.241
back with Barb and Gene,
in my room,

11:41.409 --> 11:42.993
with the No Doubt poster.
Right.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.578
Yeah.
And don't forget pregnant.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.960
Well, I know
what you're thinking.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.047
What's that?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.591
That the way I live my life
finally caught up with me.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.302
That's not what
I'm thinking.
And you would be right.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.014
Anyway, um...

12:05.183 --> 12:08.102
I just came back
because I wanted
to say thank you again.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.398
I mean, you were
a friend to me when
I did not deserve one.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.279
Forget Gene and Barb.
Stay with me.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.199
No, that's not
why I came back.
No. End of discussion.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.957
And you don't want to
get on the wrong side
of my abuela. Trust me.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.126
She's got this look
that she'll throw you
when she's aggravated.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.006
That means "tread lightly."
Yeah, I can see that.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.975
I'm going to speak up
for my mom
at the hearing today.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.394
How does your sister feel?

12:51.146 --> 12:52.312
Like I'm a traitor.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.150
She's spoken against
my mom's release every year,

12:56.317 --> 12:59.486
which is all the board
needs to hear to deny parole.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.072
Uh... That's a tough one.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.407
Yeah.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.000
You want me to
come with you today?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.629
Oh, you never know how long
these things are going to go.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.299
Could be a few hours
before we even get inside.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.094
I'm coming.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.479
Chief,
you have a call.
It sounds urgent.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.898
Okay, stand by.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.192
Here he is.
This is Chief Boden.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.235
I'm in trouble.
Ernie.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.279
Where are you?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.324
Uncle Ray makes me do it.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.285
I know. Just tell me
where you are.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.706
He'd kill me if he
knew I called you.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.833
I will not let that happen.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.211
Ernie, please,
let me help you.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.672
Ernie.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.675
Just tell me where you are.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.097
In... In front of some store
on South Halsted
and Marquette.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.226
Okay. Don't move.
I'm on my way.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.165
Ernie!

14:41.798 --> 14:45.509
We take parts
of bone and cartilage
from one vertebrae

14:46.386 --> 14:47.636
and fuse it onto the next,

14:48.221 --> 14:51.098
and then we inject
your own platelets
into the area,

14:51.266 --> 14:52.933
which increases healing.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.520
Recovery time
could be four weeks
instead of one year.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.277
How come I didn't hear about
this from my other surgeon?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.113
This isn't covered
by an HMO.
It's experimental.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.741
I'm not going to lie to you.
There are real risks here,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.160
including partial paralysis.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.251
Partial paralysis?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.253
I am so sorry.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.340
I, um, I guess I didn't
realize how risky it was.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.092
Hey.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.182
If I'm gonna risk anything,
I'll risk it on you
and me in Madrid.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.982
Is there anyone present
who would like to speak
either on behalf of

15:42.150 --> 15:46.778
or in opposition to
Nancy Annalyn Casey's
request for parole?

15:48.865 --> 15:51.325
Yes. My name
is Matthew Casey.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.162
I'm Nancy's son.
I'd like to speak, please.

16:00.293 --> 16:05.213
In four years, you've never
spoken before, Mr. Casey.
Why now? What's changed?

16:08.176 --> 16:11.219
Well, uh, when I was seven,
I, uh...

16:11.387 --> 16:14.181
I stole a baseball mitt
from a sporting goods store.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.646
I got caught and the owner
wanted to call the cops,
teach me a lesson,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.523
but my mom came
down there

16:24.609 --> 16:28.737
and got him to agree to let me
work off the cost of the mitt
by sweeping his floor.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.657
And when my sister
crashed the family car,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.659
my dad wanted to kick her
out of the house.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.370
But my mom talked to him,

16:36.537 --> 16:40.749
worked it out where Christie
could work off the repairs
by cleaning dad's office.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.003
What I'm... I'm
trying to say is that

16:45.171 --> 16:49.216
my mom understood punishment,
but she also
understood forgiveness.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.219
She did a horrible thing

16:52.387 --> 16:54.346
that she regrets terribly,

16:55.264 --> 16:56.765
and she's paid the price

16:57.225 --> 16:59.101
with 15 years of her life.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.396
But now it's time
for forgiveness,

17:03.731 --> 17:05.190
from all of us.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.654
We lost both our father
and our mother that day.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.492
So, uh...

17:16.619 --> 17:18.286
So what's changed?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.248
Well, I have.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.460
I forgive her now.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.843
Okay, thank you, Mr. Casey.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.178
Thank you.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.143
Would anyone else
like to speak either for
or in opposition to

17:41.310 --> 17:43.270
Ms. Casey's possible parole?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.494
All right then, Ms. Casey.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.667
We'll start with
a simple question.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.463
Do you feel remorse
for your crime?

18:13.342 --> 18:19.347
Yes.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.932
Yes, I do.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.727
Every day.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.123
Hey there, fellas.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.750
I'm Brian Zvonecek.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.669
I'm relieving here for
the next couple of shifts.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.511
Hey.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.225
I said hey.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.567
I know what you're doing.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.529
Oh, yeah?
What am I doing?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.912
You're not pissed at me
because I didn't
tell you first,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.414
you're pissed off because
you don't want me to go.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.380
Clarice is moving in.
She's going to
need your key.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.224
This guy, he has
a heart attack

19:44.392 --> 19:46.017
coming down the stairs.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.353
I mean, his heart
stops and everything.
I think I heard about that.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.480
Yeah, yeah. They put
the paddles on him and...

19:50.648 --> 19:52.315
...he pops right back up,

19:52.483 --> 19:54.150
like no big deal, you know?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.070
I mean, he completed training.
I think he's over at 94.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.405
I gave him the nickname
"Dead Frank."

20:01.409 --> 20:02.701
I know
where I heard
that story before.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.369
You're the guy
with the podcast.

20:05.580 --> 20:06.746
We love that podcast!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.541
Herrmann, right?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.879
He put you up to this?
No, nobody did.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.427
Truck 67,
assist the invalid.

20:20.595 --> 20:21.678
Hey, Brian?
Yeah?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.221
Why don't you drive?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.347
Seriously?

20:24.515 --> 20:27.726
Oh, yeah. I'm getting tired
of it. Been looking for
someone to take over.

20:36.611 --> 20:37.903
It's weird
without Otis here.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.614
Who am I supposed to jag?
Don't look at me.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.826
And Severide's gone too?
I mean,
he's as cocky as they come

20:44.994 --> 20:47.829
but if you were lying
in the street, he'd give you
the shirt off his back.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.790
If you're lying in the street,
why do you need his shirt?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.375
You know what I mean.

20:52.543 --> 20:55.295
How many times I got to tell
you to stay out of the
first watch crate, Mouch?

20:55.463 --> 20:59.215
They tempt me with these
marshmallows, Lieutenant.
What am I supposed to do?

21:00.426 --> 21:01.718
Give me one.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.556
Hey.
Hey!

21:06.724 --> 21:08.183
You hear anything?
Not yet.

21:08.935 --> 21:09.935
Could be a couple of days.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.187
Fingers crossed.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.521
Thanks.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.566
Chief, maybe we should
rethink the dog, eh?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.443
It's time 51 got one.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.153
Plus, it would really
piss off Mouch.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.529
No way.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.659
Peter Mills,
where is that dog?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.578
Um, I found a home for it.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.373
- You did?
- Thank God.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.666
Truck 81,

21:32.833 --> 21:36.461
Ambo 61, Engine 51.
78 Racine. Apartment fire.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.129
That's Ernie's house.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.075
Ernie!

22:12.331 --> 22:13.373
Ernie!

22:14.083 --> 22:15.542
- I'm going up.
- Okay.

22:15.710 --> 22:16.793
Spread out!

22:19.171 --> 22:20.338
Ernie!

22:22.049 --> 22:23.508
Ernie, call out!

22:26.387 --> 22:27.679
Ernie! Ernie!

22:36.063 --> 22:37.105
Ernie!

22:38.024 --> 22:39.357
Ernie, call out!

22:40.985 --> 22:49.159
Ernie!

22:56.542 --> 22:58.752
Ernie, can you hear me?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.087
I'm going to get you out.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.839
Come on.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.174
Stay with me.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.426
Okay.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.267
I'm going to get you
out of here.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.236
Okay, stay with me.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.572
Stay with me.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.414
Shay!

23:40.169 --> 23:42.128
Ernie! Ernie!

25:33.490 --> 25:34.824
What is that?

25:36.327 --> 25:37.410
I lied.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.037
Uh...

25:39.205 --> 25:41.497
I... I... I couldn't find
anyone to take her.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.917
And I couldn't bring
her at my place.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.129
Sorry, guys.

25:51.759 --> 25:52.926
Oh!

26:07.858 --> 26:10.109
Hey, do you want
to say hi to Chief?

26:18.035 --> 26:18.952
Aw...

26:21.705 --> 26:22.872
Hello?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.126
Yeah.  Parole board.

26:27.962 --> 26:31.714
I know... I know
you like my nose,
but you can't have it.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.346
Aw, sheesh!

26:39.974 --> 26:40.974
Fine.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.809
What're we going to
call this mutt?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.228
Pouch.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.022
Huh?
Half pooch, half couch.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.111
Peter Mills,
we're going to
need some bacon.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.946
- Right.
- Thank you.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.200
And?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.161
They granted her parole.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.123
Hey. Congratulations!
Yeah.

27:06.792 --> 27:07.750
What?

27:07.918 --> 27:10.003
Well, there is one condition.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.171
She has to move into
a stable household.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.466
Meaning with me.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.385
Oh.

29:06.537 --> 29:07.662
Come on!

29:11.542 --> 29:14.460
A little boy?

29:17.131 --> 29:18.506
Step back!

29:18.674 --> 29:20.007
We've got it!

29:37.192 --> 29:38.317
Nice work.

29:39.653 --> 29:42.363
These, uh... These older
houses are a tight squeeze.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.240
Thanks.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.159
I come from
a family of doctors.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.953
The first time
I saw a firefighter
jump into a truck

29:49.121 --> 29:50.496
and roar off, man!

29:51.457 --> 29:53.541
I knew I wasn't going
to medical school.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.626
I wanted to
drive a fire truck.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.628
Your parents
okay with that?
Nope.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.047
But I am.
Good for you.

30:01.758 --> 30:05.219
Hey, you know, this, uh,
spot in our house is
going to be permanent.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.180
You should put in
for a transfer.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.015
What, you serious?

30:09.183 --> 30:11.767
Hell, yeah. I've laughed
harder this week
than the last two years.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.229
And you should
see this place
in the summertime.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.023
Girls everywhere,

30:17.191 --> 30:19.317
all wanting a picture
with Chicago's finest.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.028
It's the best house
in the city.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.494
Public defender's
saying battery.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.079
Citing you personally
and the department at large.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.332
If they want to have
that discussion...

30:34.500 --> 30:36.125
You're having it now.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.254
I apprehended a suspect
in an arson and murder case,

30:40.422 --> 30:41.547
a suspect with
an APB out on him,

30:41.715 --> 30:43.299
who the CPD did not
have enough manpower

30:43.467 --> 30:45.092
to stop him from
killing a little boy!
Do you want to

30:45.260 --> 30:47.178
go back and take
the cop's test?
Because it's not too late.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.563
Oh, come on now, Wallace.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.982
No, no, no, no.
These are my bugles.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.609
I'm going on furlough.

31:01.777 --> 31:05.738
When I get back,
you can tell me if I should
put them back on again.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.411
Chief, I just want
to let you know...
Not now.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.146
I'm a stupid ass. I know.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.815
Yep.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.737
And I'm sorry.
I should have...

31:48.448 --> 31:50.783
I should have camped
outside your room
to tell you first.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.413
You're my best friend, Shay.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.210
Next time?

32:03.839 --> 32:05.047
Hey!

32:05.674 --> 32:07.425
No next time, I swear.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.678
I'm glad you're
getting yourself healthy.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.930
Even if it means
I have to let you go.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.018
No one's letting go.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.481
Come on, let's go in.
I'm cold.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.150
All right. Yeah.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.904
Hey, you know,
tasers are totally
against the rules.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.906
I know that.
It's page one.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.617
All you.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.202
Surprise!

32:38.457 --> 32:39.582
I knew it.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.251
Hey.
Hi.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.587
Mmm.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.505
Not sure what
we're going to
do without you.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.133
Cheers.

32:54.890 --> 32:55.890
Hey.

32:56.058 --> 32:59.310
Look, um, I promise you
that I understand, you know?

32:59.478 --> 33:03.147
This is just an opportunity
for us to be roommates,
nothing more...

33:12.574 --> 33:13.908
What was that?

33:14.701 --> 33:15.993
I love you.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.204
I've always loved you.

33:19.373 --> 33:20.498
I love you, too.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.138
You sure you want
to do this, Peter Mills?

33:36.306 --> 33:37.973
I've been waiting
all day, baby.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.101
Want to sneak outta here?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.186
Your place? 10 minutes?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.479
You're on.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.352
Sorry, have you seen Kelly?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.895
Yeah, he's over there.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.232
Or... Was.
Oh...

34:53.884 --> 34:56.427
So it's 15 degrees
and there was
this homeless guy

34:56.595 --> 34:58.304
that used to hang around
in an alley behind the house.

34:58.472 --> 35:03.058
And we find him,
and he is frozen solid.
I mean, he's a block of ice.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.852
So, I call the morgue,
and I say,

35:05.020 --> 35:08.814
"Listen, we got a frozen
dead guy and you've
got to come pick him up."

35:08.982 --> 35:11.233
And they say, "Well,
he can't just be dead,

35:11.401 --> 35:13.819
"he's got to be
warm and dead before
we'll come and get him."

35:14.529 --> 35:16.989
So we drag the homeless guy
across to the apparatus floor

35:17.157 --> 35:19.158
and we wait for him
to thaw out
for about 10 hours.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.537
Anyway, eventually he got
warm enough and dead enough
to actually be dead.

35:23.705 --> 35:24.830
So they came and got him.

35:24.998 --> 35:27.041
You still telling that one?

35:32.172 --> 35:33.214
Well, I'll be damned.

35:34.508 --> 35:35.633
Guys.
Hey.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.051
How you doing?
Dad.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.015
You want something to eat?
No, I'm good, thanks.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.522
Uh...

35:51.066 --> 35:53.484
I'm leaving the CFD.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.034
What happens when
you and this Renée
get tired of each other

36:02.202 --> 36:04.870
and you find yourself
in some Godforsaken country

36:05.038 --> 36:07.081
with nothing to show
for it but a pension?

36:07.249 --> 36:08.707
I don't know.
This doesn't look so bad.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.419
Trust me,
you're worried about
partial paralysis?

36:13.588 --> 36:16.131
How about full paralysis?
Because that's what this is.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.097
There is no replacing
Rescue Squad.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.482
But you already know that.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.819
That's why
you came out here,

36:36.987 --> 36:38.654
so I could
talk you out of going.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.452
Look,

36:46.955 --> 36:49.832
I know I wasn't there
for you like I could've been
or should've been,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.251
and I'm three wives removed
from your mother,

36:52.669 --> 36:54.962
and I'm in no position
to give you advice.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.381
But you're scared, Kelly.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.426
And you know why
you're scared?

37:01.011 --> 37:03.012
Because you're
not ready for this.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.640
Bennie, you ready?

37:13.690 --> 37:15.691
She's counting on me.
I promised her.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.610
She'll get over it.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.573
Disappoint anyone, hell,
disappoint everyone,

37:23.158 --> 37:25.200
but don't ever
disappoint yourself.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.749
It's good to see you.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.919
You too, Pop.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.213
Hey.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.799
What's going on?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.344
I'm, uh...

38:27.305 --> 38:28.639
I'm going to get the surgery.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.517
Oh, Kelly, come on.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.270
It's... It's just not
worth the risk. I mean...

38:36.106 --> 38:38.565
We'll do it right.
You'll come with me...

38:38.984 --> 38:40.567
You'll recuperate in...

38:45.907 --> 38:47.157
You want to stay.

39:02.132 --> 39:03.882
I should have known.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.303
I was that close to
not even telling you.

39:12.225 --> 39:15.227
And you would have
come with me to Madrid,

39:16.354 --> 39:19.106
and the sky would have
been the limit for us.
Hey, hey.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.693
What you did

39:24.529 --> 39:27.156
might be the most
important thing anyone's
ever done for me.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.413
Thank you.
Yeah.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.047
Well, uh...

39:44.090 --> 39:46.800
I guess now we're even.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.387
Yeah.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.181
We're even.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.228
Shonda.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.563
Wallace.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.691
Can I please see Jimmy?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.693
No.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.321
He's not your son.
The hell he ain't.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.907
I raised him from
the time he was three

40:52.784 --> 40:55.619
and never used
the word "stepson",
not once.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.707
I need to see him.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.636
Hey!

41:12.804 --> 41:14.429
Ralphie!

41:14.597 --> 41:16.890
How are you?
I miss you, boy!

41:17.350 --> 41:18.433
You good?

41:25.275 --> 41:26.191
Dad.

41:34.367 --> 41:35.450
Oh, God.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.358
You ready?
