00:15.744 --> 00:17.764
Previously on Powers...

00:17.790 --> 00:20.160
- Wolfe broke out of his restraints.
- What the fuck?

00:21.962 --> 00:23.310
You came back for me.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.673
I thought you'd forgotten me.

00:24.709 --> 00:27.595
I poked him in his fucking
brain too many times.

00:27.631 --> 00:30.450
And made his power work
harder. I fucked it up.

00:30.496 --> 00:32.014
- Where's Calista?
- Hey.

00:32.081 --> 00:33.761
Are you gonna give me your number or what?

00:33.880 --> 00:36.543
- He just ate six people.
- We can contain him.

00:40.151 --> 00:42.449
I call it a Drainer. It
takes away their powers.

00:42.486 --> 00:45.243
Sway is Wolfe.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.101
I thought it would allow

00:47.117 --> 00:50.256
people with limited powers
to reach their full potential.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.915
You don't think I can do it?

00:52.967 --> 00:54.355
Wolfe has taken down Powers

00:54.381 --> 00:56.782
- with years of experience in action.
- You work for me.

00:57.252 --> 00:58.609
Not the other way around.

01:00.504 --> 01:03.720
If your partner is still alive, it's
only because Wolfe wants him to be.

01:03.751 --> 01:05.242
There's power here.

01:05.254 --> 01:06.441
Get out of my way.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.464
River was real.

01:14.511 --> 01:16.385
He always stood for the truth.

01:56.143 --> 01:59.608
_

02:08.145 --> 02:09.215
Jesus shit, Johnny.

02:09.219 --> 02:10.751
Want to see something rad?*

02:11.136 --> 02:12.404
Look over there.

02:16.535 --> 02:18.195
Here and gone, dude.

02:18.237 --> 02:20.174
You're gonna get fucking caught one day.

02:20.199 --> 02:23.054
My timing is perfect. Half
a second before or after, and

02:23.080 --> 02:25.884
the bartender and I would
have been on intimate terms.

02:30.966 --> 02:33.218
Yo, she just checked me out, right?

02:33.457 --> 02:34.825
You should go for it.

02:34.870 --> 02:36.985
Take a bottle over there and pour a drink.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.812
How smooth is that?

02:39.474 --> 02:41.254
Or, you could go over there

02:41.374 --> 02:42.705
make your move and,

02:42.787 --> 02:44.712
she shoots you down cold.

02:44.786 --> 02:47.305
- In front of everyone.
- Shut the fuck up.

03:00.012 --> 03:01.590
Do you remember me,

03:01.644 --> 03:02.644
teacher?

03:05.854 --> 03:08.249
You weren't lost.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.655
You were a cocky little shit.

03:19.251 --> 03:20.251
Come on.

03:23.456 --> 03:25.855
- Dude, he's waiting!
- Yeah.

03:30.491 --> 03:31.900
Thank you, Johnny.

03:33.441 --> 03:34.441
Ah?

03:34.890 --> 03:36.381
Glasses would be nice.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.008
- Oh no, that's my bad.
- I'm on it.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.709
Let him make up for his
own mistakes, Christian.

03:41.723 --> 03:43.871
You will not always be
there to cover for him.

03:44.937 --> 03:46.254
I don't cover for him.

03:48.324 --> 03:48.919
Shit!

03:48.948 --> 03:49.988
- It's all good, man.
- Sorry.

03:50.009 --> 03:51.009
I got it.

03:51.029 --> 03:52.033
We didn't know.

03:54.106 --> 03:56.460
Me, Johnny, all of us. We didn't know.

03:56.856 --> 03:57.942
Who we were.

03:58.623 --> 03:59.878
What we could be.

04:00.973 --> 04:02.324
You showed us.

04:02.749 --> 04:05.623
When I first came to America,

04:05.743 --> 04:07.350
after the war,

04:07.388 --> 04:09.559
I camped one night with a true

04:09.638 --> 04:12.081
fucking, gentleman tramp.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.566
A proper Baraby.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.308
I'd got my hands on a bottle of Dago Red,

04:18.284 --> 04:20.795
but when I offered him a swig, he

04:20.952 --> 04:22.166
demurred.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.221
He said, "My boy, my boy.

04:26.211 --> 04:28.219
We must always endeavor

04:28.574 --> 04:31.874
to be civilized. After all,
we are not animals, are we?"

04:33.022 --> 04:34.121
This said,

04:34.340 --> 04:37.223
he plucked two crystal tumblers

04:37.232 --> 04:38.484
from his knapsack

04:38.786 --> 04:40.735
rubbed his kerchief over them,

04:40.752 --> 04:42.193
and gave us both a drink.

04:42.652 --> 04:44.213
And from that day to this,

04:44.960 --> 04:47.170
I have not drunk from the neck of a bottle.

04:49.449 --> 04:51.378
Be true to yourself.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.489
Be powerful

04:55.897 --> 04:58.334
No... this... this isn't you.

04:58.951 --> 05:01.586
This is not who you are!

05:10.023 --> 05:11.274
To that

05:11.770 --> 05:14.661
old Baraby and his civilizing influence.

05:15.004 --> 05:16.016
Prost!

06:26.242 --> 06:27.989
Yes.

06:29.314 --> 06:32.230
I remember you, Christian.

06:33.260 --> 06:38.126
You and your disappointing
love of shiny things.

06:40.956 --> 06:42.101
Look at her.

06:42.175 --> 06:44.315
All wrapped up like a Christmas present.

06:46.685 --> 06:47.750
She's smart.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.447
She's branding herself.
Reinforcing her message.

06:52.021 --> 06:55.741
- And what is her message?
- "Buy more Retro Girl merchandise".

06:55.763 --> 06:58.046
Nah, her message is, "I'm here."

06:58.496 --> 07:00.730
I mean, she's so fucking good at it.

07:01.610 --> 07:03.334
She is so good

07:03.506 --> 07:04.818
at being a hero.

07:07.352 --> 07:09.378
You wanted to be a hero.

07:13.048 --> 07:14.991
You refuse to believe

07:15.010 --> 07:17.957
that there are no heroes.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.982
Heroic acts in the pursuit of glory

07:22.003 --> 07:24.091
have no virtue.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.453
You refused to believe

07:29.467 --> 07:31.806
that there are no heroes.

07:32.140 --> 07:34.087
And then you prove me right.

07:35.547 --> 07:36.767
You...

07:37.553 --> 07:39.338
The true secret

07:39.576 --> 07:42.656
of achieving your full potential is knowing

07:43.122 --> 07:44.748
how little time you have.

07:44.828 --> 07:46.125
Here and gone.

07:46.207 --> 07:47.537
All right. Well,

07:47.544 --> 07:50.031
while you two philosophers
figure out the world,

07:50.976 --> 07:52.855
I'm gonna go see what I'm capable of.

07:55.041 --> 07:55.872
Cheers.

07:55.929 --> 07:58.495
What has become of you, Christian?

08:01.104 --> 08:03.273
I became a cop.

08:23.824 --> 08:25.468
Too late for this.

08:27.492 --> 08:28.888
You had your chance.

08:32.325 --> 08:34.323
You put me in here.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.385
What has happened to you?

08:39.049 --> 08:41.037
And why...

08:41.284 --> 08:42.684
why...

08:43.201 --> 08:44.246
why...

08:45.217 --> 08:47.448
why do you smell like me?

08:49.963 --> 08:53.980
Breaking news from the Federal Powers
containment facility in Los Angeles:

08:54.011 --> 08:57.378
The vicious Power known as
Wolfe, has escaped his cell.

08:57.392 --> 08:59.923
We've been informed by
the Federal Powers Bureau,

08:59.936 --> 09:01.914
and the local Powers law enforcement

09:01.943 --> 09:04.983
that the notorious mass murderer, Wolfe,

09:05.268 --> 09:06.449
has escaped.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.878
Shakedown in the Shaft.

09:07.894 --> 09:09.017
People are asking,

09:09.034 --> 09:11.297
"how could the man-eater
have broken loose?"

09:11.314 --> 09:13.044
Is this real, is this... confirmed?

09:13.061 --> 09:15.365
Wolfe's 2000 escape
resulted in the massacre

09:15.382 --> 09:17.678
of hundreds at the Sky
Terrace Amphitheater.

09:17.798 --> 09:21.467
Only after the fan favorite
Powers United crashed in,

09:21.484 --> 09:22.839
was the day saved.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.263
But that was the end for
the flashy super team.

09:25.279 --> 09:27.634
Who doesn't feel like an
outsider sometimes? I mean...

09:27.932 --> 09:30.340
who doesn't feel like an
outsider most of the time?

09:32.031 --> 09:33.270
The years

09:33.390 --> 09:34.407
I was alone,

09:34.832 --> 09:37.925
were lonely. I didn't know who
I was, I didn't know how I felt.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.293
Because you were a Power?

09:39.327 --> 09:40.942
Because I was me, because

09:40.953 --> 09:42.420
I was different.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.624
Because there was no one else like me.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.224
And that is a lonely feeling.

09:46.231 --> 09:47.546
And we can all feel it.

09:48.289 --> 09:49.911
And the world keeps telling us

09:49.921 --> 09:51.241
that we shouldn't feel different.

09:52.218 --> 09:53.787
But if we do feel different...

09:53.864 --> 09:54.990
We should stay apart.

09:55.143 --> 09:56.841
Because we won't be accepted.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.188
And we may not be.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.654
And we may never

10:00.664 --> 10:02.412
be accepted. But that is not my problem.

10:02.963 --> 10:04.278
That's someone else's problem.

10:05.114 --> 10:06.627
- ...My problem...
- Climbing out of windows sucks.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.527
- The only problem I have in life is
- Aw!

10:08.541 --> 10:09.372
- Shit.
- Shit.

10:09.373 --> 10:10.867
- Where's your mom?
- ...who I am...

10:10.870 --> 10:12.902
- Working.
- ...and how I want to live my life.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.366
I can be with people,

10:14.706 --> 10:16.331
and not have it cost me anything.

10:16.337 --> 10:18.537
So you're actually terrible
at sneaking through windows.

10:19.342 --> 10:21.642
Fuck you. I'm awesome.

10:22.712 --> 10:24.281
Is that how you chose your name?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.280
Wolfe?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.839
Because, being alone,

10:26.898 --> 10:28.880
being a loner, made
you feel like an animal?

10:29.535 --> 10:31.602
They should have killed him
back when they first caught him.

10:31.613 --> 10:33.229
I chose my name when I was a kid.

10:34.791 --> 10:36.367
Because it made me feel cool.

10:38.548 --> 10:40.253
He's a master of charm.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.137
You can see how he flirts with the

10:42.179 --> 10:44.148
horrible truth of those decades,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.268
when he drifted,

10:45.390 --> 10:47.015
almost invisibly,

10:47.022 --> 10:49.047
through Europe and the Americas.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.302
They had a trial.

10:51.369 --> 10:53.596
They said he was too crazy to execute.

10:53.603 --> 10:55.347
Of course, he's crazy.

10:56.081 --> 10:57.502
Anyone who'd eat people.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.063
I mean...

11:01.105 --> 11:02.321
I don't know.

11:03.215 --> 11:04.215
Maybe.

11:05.746 --> 11:06.965
I guess with Wolfe...

11:07.186 --> 11:08.247
he's an exception.

11:09.847 --> 11:11.491
Well, he's the worst one, but...

11:12.480 --> 11:13.933
I mean, it's like my mom, right?

11:14.557 --> 11:16.302
She's a Powers publicist.

11:17.157 --> 11:18.214
So I see

11:18.221 --> 11:19.565
all the bullshit.

11:20.249 --> 11:22.840
I mean, all of them are full of bullshit.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.074
Not all of them.

11:27.942 --> 11:30.589
You know the problem
is, they're still people.

11:31.426 --> 11:33.279
And people make mistakes, right?

11:34.251 --> 11:36.048
But when we make mistakes, it's like

11:36.088 --> 11:38.107
so what, we can fix it.

11:39.439 --> 11:40.966
When they make mistakes...

11:42.102 --> 11:44.785
I mean one Powers mistake
can kill hundreds of people.

11:48.173 --> 11:49.439
It's like having

11:49.677 --> 11:51.699
a bunch of Godzillas on the loose.

11:54.036 --> 11:56.174
Except everyone thinks they're super cool.

11:57.541 --> 12:01.108
Before the Sky Terrace
Amphitheater slaughter in 2004,

12:01.119 --> 12:05.164
before the Powerz Kidz massacre
in the Sanction Lounge in 1994,

12:05.170 --> 12:06.802
how many people do we know,

12:06.922 --> 12:08.268
he killed.

12:08.309 --> 12:10.581
We may never have a proper count.

12:10.617 --> 12:13.121
Thousands. Undoubtedly thousands.

12:13.183 --> 12:15.677
Thousands of unsolved deaths, and

12:15.692 --> 12:19.265
missing persons that no one
could have thought to associate

12:19.311 --> 12:22.517
with the charismatic,
mysterious Power, Wolfe.

12:26.421 --> 12:27.515
All right.

12:27.753 --> 12:31.361
So, jus... just keep
your comments brief, OK?

12:31.481 --> 12:32.957
Say, um,

12:33.411 --> 12:36.396
- uh, "I'm here to help".
- Oh my god.

12:36.412 --> 12:38.262
That's perfect. Did you
just come up with that?

12:38.266 --> 12:38.828
Shut up, Paola.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.873
Fuck you, Craig, she shouldn't be here.

12:40.902 --> 12:43.017
This is not the rollout
that we had planned.

12:43.504 --> 12:46.606
Look, we go in their green
room, and we wait this thing out.

12:55.355 --> 12:57.414
Don't forget to... hey!

12:57.856 --> 12:59.797
Don't forget to say your name!

13:03.097 --> 13:05.575
You have a great look.
What... Tell us your name.

13:13.264 --> 13:17.381
- Where are you going?
- Hey... What's your name?

13:23.765 --> 13:25.785
Despite the risk of Powers intervention,

13:25.817 --> 13:28.627
pressure is increasing
for Retro Girl to abandon

13:28.648 --> 13:30.646
her Hurricane Pulp rescue efforts,

13:30.651 --> 13:32.825
and jump into the fray at the Shaft.

13:32.865 --> 13:35.471
At this point, it is a Category 4,

13:35.472 --> 13:37.156
but gaining strength.

13:37.157 --> 13:39.093
They say by the time it hits land...

13:39.104 --> 13:41.327
Winds are 150 mph.

13:41.347 --> 13:42.491
153.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.483
Oh, and it's almost a Category 5.

13:45.681 --> 13:48.414
- The outflow, is it 36,000...
- Excuse me, ma'am.

13:48.431 --> 13:49.815
I have that update from the Shaft.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.396
They're saying that some
cops have been killed

13:51.413 --> 13:53.974
and there's a possibility
that Level 8 has been breached.

13:54.574 --> 13:55.532
You should go.

13:55.553 --> 13:56.552
We can get the Chinooks up.

13:56.581 --> 13:58.105
- No, no, no, no.
- ...Get to the site in ten minutes.

13:58.113 --> 14:00.052
That won't work, nothing can fly out there.

14:02.314 --> 14:03.990
All right, sweetheart,

14:04.007 --> 14:06.015
these are my friends, and
they're gonna look after you.

14:06.060 --> 14:08.654
They're gonna give you
food, and dry clothes.

14:08.774 --> 14:10.248
And you are gonna be just fine.

14:10.881 --> 14:12.323
I will find your brother.

14:13.347 --> 14:14.631
I promise you.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.844
Come on, sweetheart. Come with me.

14:19.219 --> 14:20.892
If Wolfe is on Level 8...

14:20.905 --> 14:23.164
No, no, not yet.

14:24.393 --> 14:26.392
I couldn't find her brother.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.850
You put me in here.

14:50.839 --> 14:51.839
Why...

14:52.728 --> 14:53.728
Why...

14:54.817 --> 14:55.817
Why...

14:58.023 --> 14:59.332
Crap!

15:01.648 --> 15:04.453
I don't want to be this anymore.

15:04.463 --> 15:06.796
We gotta get him out of
here. Powers are coming.

15:07.016 --> 15:08.034
I tried.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.284
I tried.

15:11.574 --> 15:12.988
I tried.

15:21.679 --> 15:25.061
Kill... me

15:25.601 --> 15:27.217
You can't kill him, OK?

15:27.242 --> 15:28.580
He... he's our teacher.

15:28.597 --> 15:31.474
- He... he.. he... he's like...
- Fucking listen!

15:32.918 --> 15:35.353
We can't kill him, 'cause
killers can't be heroes!

15:36.704 --> 15:37.976
But we can.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.780
We stopped him.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.315
People are gonna think that we stopped him.

15:43.893 --> 15:45.519
If we can capture him,

15:46.896 --> 15:47.896
we'll be...

15:49.298 --> 15:50.676
we'll be it, man.

15:50.829 --> 15:52.342
This is what we want.

15:54.325 --> 15:56.390
We'll be fucking heroes!

16:01.513 --> 16:04.893
No! I want it. I want it back!

16:05.266 --> 16:06.895
Give it back.

16:52.021 --> 16:53.869
There goes Triphammer's video feed.

16:57.735 --> 16:59.255
It's time to send them in.

17:09.065 --> 17:10.890
They'd just feed Wolfe.

17:12.472 --> 17:14.632
- Where's Retro Girl?
- We don't know.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.635
Last word, she was still in the storm.

17:16.924 --> 17:18.724
Someone's gotta do something.

17:27.273 --> 17:28.319
Fuck it, I'm out.

17:31.908 --> 17:34.089
- Hold on.
- No, you hold on.

17:34.109 --> 17:35.113
That's my green light.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.881
This is not a show.

17:37.409 --> 17:39.462
And I'm not a fucking performer.

17:42.376 --> 17:43.624
I'm here to help.

17:44.495 --> 17:47.870
Keep your eyes moving at all times.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.359
Watch your periphery and don't
turn your back on him, ever.

18:09.077 --> 18:10.580
We can help him.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.322
I would eat you.

18:12.351 --> 18:14.102
But you're a fucking robot.

18:27.228 --> 18:29.620
We have to get him out of
here. Powers are coming.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.420
Powers are coming.

18:31.594 --> 18:32.738
Johnny.

18:36.509 --> 18:39.045
Johnny wouldn't take
me with him, Christian.

18:41.003 --> 18:42.196
Why?

18:45.054 --> 18:46.934
He came to me, over and over.

18:47.685 --> 18:49.613
But he wouldn't take me with him.

18:51.221 --> 18:52.377
What did he want from me?

18:54.732 --> 18:57.586
Anything to do with that red in your eyes?

18:57.599 --> 18:59.462
I want my powers back!

19:00.140 --> 19:01.507
Your powers.

19:01.627 --> 19:03.771
"Your" powers?

19:03.961 --> 19:07.116
Your powers are gone. I shat them out.

19:08.967 --> 19:10.652
Your powers...

19:11.635 --> 19:15.283
I used them up, you fucking asshole.

19:15.321 --> 19:19.660
There's nothing in me that's yours.
And you can't have any of mine.

19:20.980 --> 19:22.351
I want

19:22.773 --> 19:24.309
them back!

19:42.595 --> 19:43.656
No!

19:56.810 --> 19:57.810
Get...

19:58.057 --> 19:59.057
Out...

20:01.670 --> 20:04.078
Out of there you rancid,

20:04.198 --> 20:07.051
foul-tasting, shit.

20:08.187 --> 20:10.137
I see you, old man.

20:10.797 --> 20:12.020
I...

20:12.227 --> 20:13.309
see...

20:13.891 --> 20:15.126
you.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.051
No!

20:27.679 --> 20:28.959
What the fuck are you doing?

20:28.985 --> 20:31.066
Don't worry. I've been living for this.

23:48.438 --> 23:50.377
Are you gonna be a fucking hero with me?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.086
Or are you gonna puss out?

24:04.432 --> 24:07.744
Then I'm throwing him...
down the fucking Shaft.

24:59.902 --> 25:01.389
How does it feel

25:02.971 --> 25:03.992
to be

25:04.981 --> 25:06.719
powerless?

25:23.071 --> 25:24.462
Kill me.

25:26.578 --> 25:27.744
Please.

25:33.435 --> 25:35.037
You're a pathetic, old man.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.083
If we can capture him,

26:10.341 --> 26:12.706
we're gonna be fucking heroes.

26:12.765 --> 26:18.944
Heroes, heroes, hereos, hereos, hereos.

26:50.131 --> 26:51.131
Coming through. Hold up.

26:51.885 --> 26:52.599
Hold on...

26:52.622 --> 26:54.073
They got him.

26:54.193 --> 26:55.513
How did you do it?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.284
How did you do it?

27:01.183 --> 27:02.468
Coming through. Coming through.

27:02.507 --> 27:04.810
Just tell us in your
own words how you did it.

27:05.316 --> 27:06.316
I...

27:08.131 --> 27:09.285
I...

27:10.506 --> 27:12.578
I knocked Wolfe down.

27:13.986 --> 27:15.661
And... ah...

27:15.882 --> 27:17.349
What's your name?

27:24.093 --> 27:25.368
My name is Zora.

27:25.673 --> 27:27.167
Thank you very much. Thank you.

27:27.256 --> 27:28.373
We've gotta run.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.019
A new hero is born, and her name is Zora.

27:32.032 --> 27:33.211
In her own words,

27:33.224 --> 27:35.722
she took out Wolfe with a single blow.

27:35.753 --> 27:39.568
Zora may be a well heeled graduate
of the Manchester Academy, but

27:39.578 --> 27:40.860
as these photos show,

27:40.876 --> 27:43.890
she's not above slummin'
it with the Powers Kidz.

27:43.906 --> 27:47.076
Zora's interests extent
beyond defeating supervillains.

27:47.081 --> 27:49.859
She's also a well-known
maven of the fashion world.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.242
That costume?

27:51.362 --> 27:52.736
She designed it herself.

27:53.075 --> 27:54.471
Purple is the new black.

27:54.483 --> 27:55.966
You heard it here first.

27:56.292 --> 27:57.779
I hate her.

27:59.302 --> 28:01.149
She does seem pretty full of herself.

28:02.053 --> 28:04.700
She's acting like she's the
only one on the planet right now.

28:05.687 --> 28:07.562
What about all the people that died today?

28:08.133 --> 28:09.347
What about them?

28:24.774 --> 28:26.278
It's cool, but what is it?

28:27.970 --> 28:30.548
When Powers are around people die.

28:30.992 --> 28:34.507
I mean, it doesn't matter if they're good
or bad, there's always collateral damage.

28:34.834 --> 28:36.503
And no one ever talks about that.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.899
You know, this is...

28:40.290 --> 28:41.856
education.

28:41.976 --> 28:43.214
You know, I mean...

28:43.268 --> 28:45.019
We're just trying to raise awareness.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.477
We? Who... who's "we"?

28:49.690 --> 28:51.794
Well, I was hoping you'd help me.

29:07.747 --> 29:11.180
Federal agencies report Wolfe
has been recaptured by Zora,

29:11.221 --> 29:15.442
and is being kept under control
by a revolutionary new technology.

29:15.562 --> 29:19.508
Dubbed the "Drainer" by it's
inventor, Harley "Triphammer" Cohen,

29:19.527 --> 29:21.709
this device may be the game changer

29:21.747 --> 29:24.316
Powers Law Enforcement has long sought.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.486
This highly effective tool

29:27.502 --> 29:31.553
in Powers control will signal
a new era for our division.

29:32.546 --> 29:34.549
Despite our terrible losses,

29:34.864 --> 29:36.460
despite our losses,

29:37.200 --> 29:39.578
we will be stronger, than ever.

29:40.386 --> 29:42.199
What's the tool called?

29:42.507 --> 29:44.457
They take everything from us.

29:44.811 --> 29:46.483
It's called a Drainer.

29:46.966 --> 29:49.495
It's simplest terms,
the green light goes on

29:49.541 --> 29:51.766
the powers go off.

29:51.801 --> 29:54.951
- They'll make us be alone.
- Yeah, alone and trapped.

29:57.188 --> 29:59.836
I want all the Sway we have.

30:00.905 --> 30:03.640
I want every dose that's out there.

30:03.956 --> 30:06.047
I want if off the streets.

30:06.048 --> 30:09.439
And I want the name of
every kid who's taken it.

30:11.617 --> 30:12.918
Now!

30:13.223 --> 30:14.607
Do it now!

30:35.369 --> 30:36.892
Shit!

30:43.790 --> 30:45.200
There he is.

30:46.691 --> 30:47.691
Hey.

30:53.047 --> 30:55.804
- Oh... is Wolfe still...?
- Locked up

30:57.453 --> 30:58.936
Don't you remember?

31:00.533 --> 31:01.927
Yeah.

31:02.981 --> 31:04.257
Yeah.

31:04.377 --> 31:06.673
That purple girl, Zora, she got him.

31:13.365 --> 31:14.365
Good.

31:17.263 --> 31:20.397
Good. Um, Deena, my partner?

31:20.517 --> 31:22.152
- She...
- She's all right.

31:24.089 --> 31:25.989
She's getting taped up.

31:32.887 --> 31:34.761
Yeah, thank god for Zora.

31:35.391 --> 31:37.131
Thank god for the new blood.

31:41.072 --> 31:42.962
I could feel his breath, Christian.

31:45.182 --> 31:48.016
I could feel his breath
on the back of my neck.

31:52.249 --> 31:53.772
You were saved.

31:55.295 --> 31:57.031
By Zora.

32:00.613 --> 32:02.607
Girl's got the power.

32:03.665 --> 32:05.556
She's a headcase, but...

32:05.905 --> 32:07.260
she's got the power.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.874
At least she'll fit in
with the rest of us, right?

32:10.880 --> 32:11.880
Yeah.

32:16.328 --> 32:17.328
Hey, you..

32:17.454 --> 32:19.539
Remember when we first met?

32:22.235 --> 32:23.903
Yeah, of course.

32:24.858 --> 32:26.427
I was such a punk.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.292
I liked punks.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.685
Lucky for me.

32:38.065 --> 32:41.488
Christian, you... you were never
as bad as you thought you were.

32:43.718 --> 32:45.102
I could have been better.

32:46.424 --> 32:48.324
We could all be better.

32:54.375 --> 32:55.375
Hey.

33:01.382 --> 33:03.705
In the hurricane, there was a...

33:06.833 --> 33:08.465
there was this little boy...

33:10.344 --> 33:11.893
and I found him. He...

33:13.334 --> 33:14.392
he wasn't...

33:16.979 --> 33:18.104
he didn't...

33:19.247 --> 33:21.450
And I promised, you know?

33:23.676 --> 33:26.619
Why can't I learn not to promise?
I have to learn not to promise.

33:27.476 --> 33:29.604
Because I can't save them all.

33:29.934 --> 33:31.049
It's OK.

33:33.058 --> 33:34.137
It's OK.

33:37.012 --> 33:38.303
I'm sorry.

33:38.944 --> 33:41.216
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

33:41.221 --> 33:42.915
It's OK. You can... you can

33:42.930 --> 33:44.288
you can take a rest.

33:44.603 --> 33:46.255
You deserve a rest.

33:47.633 --> 33:48.805
Come on.

33:53.213 --> 33:55.619
You don't have to do it all yourself.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.479
You know? You... you can have help.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.633
When... when someone's there,
all... all you have to do is ask.

34:03.859 --> 34:05.119
People wanna help.

34:06.942 --> 34:08.902
You just have to ask.

34:10.014 --> 34:11.232
I'm sorry.

34:12.103 --> 34:13.493
I'm so tired.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.610
It's OK.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.792
You sleep.

34:17.612 --> 34:19.260
I got this, OK?

34:19.306 --> 34:21.217
I got this watch.

34:21.337 --> 34:22.337
You sleep.

34:31.864 --> 34:33.145
Janis.

34:37.815 --> 34:39.250
We're capable of...

34:39.370 --> 34:41.187
so much, you know?

34:43.571 --> 34:45.962
People don't know what we're capable of.

35:15.804 --> 35:16.867
Hey.

35:18.194 --> 35:19.413
Christian.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.310
Hello, Christian.

35:23.084 --> 35:24.577
I'm Janis.

35:24.697 --> 35:26.381
Yeah, I know.

35:27.497 --> 35:29.736
- Is there something...?
- Yeah, well...

35:30.007 --> 35:31.892
You see, I'd love to buy you a drink.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.473
But seeing as I'm broke, I... can't.

35:35.596 --> 35:37.106
But the music's free.

35:38.287 --> 35:40.275
Got you covered on that.
