2-4-3-8-7-8-7.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.521
The base is under attack.

00:56.522 --> 00:57.857
The prisoners have escaped.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.991
Please, send help!

00:59.992 --> 01:00.891
Echo 1

01:00.892 --> 01:03.128
entering science
and medical wing.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.802
Come on! We are dying!

01:14.472 --> 01:15.833
All units be advised!

01:15.974 --> 01:17.642
The base is in lockdown!

02:22.208 --> 02:25.275
[Klaxon blares, indistinct p.A.

03:38.883 --> 03:41.585
Your primary targets
are extremely hostile.

03:41.586 --> 03:46.757
Your orders are to eliminate on
sight with extreme prejudice.

03:46.758 --> 03:50.460
These targets will be in prisoner
quarantine on level four.

03:50.461 --> 03:54.698
Secondary is the extraction
of the lead science team.

03:54.699 --> 03:58.769
Report your elimination of
targets by the numbers.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.137
Echo 1, you take the lead.

04:00.138 --> 04:01.905
Breach and secure the entrance.

04:01.906 --> 04:05.575
Echo 2, enter via the service
tunnels and secure level three.

04:05.576 --> 04:08.179
Echo 3, locate and
evac science team.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.317
Echo 4, clear
prisoner quarantine.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.217
Nice!

04:14.218 --> 04:16.921
It's a fuckin' shame.

04:16.922 --> 04:21.757
Once we infiltrate the facility,
base security will be on high alert.

04:21.759 --> 04:23.093
But give them no quarter.

04:23.094 --> 04:24.127
Make no mistake.

04:24.128 --> 04:26.763
Today they'll give
you none in return.

04:26.764 --> 04:30.301
Takin' care of business.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.203
30 seconds to insertion point.

04:32.204 --> 04:34.205
Like ridin' a bike, chief.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.808
It's good to have you back.

05:37.536 --> 05:39.204
Entering maintenance compound.

06:26.317 --> 06:27.818
God!

06:52.411 --> 06:54.311
Help me.

06:54.312 --> 06:55.014
Help me.

06:57.882 --> 07:00.518
Echo daddy, have
entered prisoner quarantine.

07:00.519 --> 07:01.285
Shh.

07:01.286 --> 07:04.321
Clear, standby.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.891
Echo daddy, cells one
through eight are open.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.960
Targets are mobile.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.193
No, please, no.

07:14.065 --> 07:18.568
Echo daddy, tango 3 eliminated.

08:19.197 --> 08:20.897
All echo units be advised.

08:20.898 --> 08:23.967
Targets have entered
the ducting systems.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.874
This is echo daddy, report.

08:29.875 --> 08:33.311
Targets have entered
the ducting systems.

08:37.215 --> 08:39.716
Echo 3, targets are
on your level.

08:50.562 --> 08:52.096
Give me eyes, kid, where are we?

08:52.097 --> 08:53.965
- Wiki.
- Yep.

08:58.803 --> 08:59.837
Section 4f.

08:59.838 --> 09:02.038
K-9 neurological research wing.

09:02.039 --> 09:04.307
I fuckin' hate dogs.

09:04.308 --> 09:05.342
What, so no white picket

09:05.343 --> 09:08.078
fence, 2.1 kids and a family
dog for you two then, eh?

09:08.079 --> 09:09.615
She's more of a cat person.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.514
She loves the pussy.

09:11.515 --> 09:13.883
Yeah, you fuckin' wish.

09:15.153 --> 09:16.821
Cut the chatter.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.098
Prisoner quarantine cleared.

09:41.779 --> 09:43.114
You o.K., chief?

09:43.115 --> 09:45.715
You seem a little distracted.

09:45.716 --> 09:48.719
I'm fine.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.654
We've got a job to do.

09:50.655 --> 09:52.922
Let's just get it done.

09:52.923 --> 09:58.262
Amen to that, 'cause I'm
already starting to cramp up.

09:58.263 --> 09:59.562
Clear.

09:59.563 --> 10:01.264
Go.

10:01.265 --> 10:04.268
I got sand in orifices I
didn't even know I had.

10:28.393 --> 10:30.662
How did we pull this
sewer rat detail anyway?

10:55.220 --> 10:59.389
You've gotta
be fucking shitting me.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.959
This one's base security.

11:13.538 --> 11:18.776
Says he's... biomechanic.

11:18.777 --> 11:21.278
John mckinny.

11:21.279 --> 11:25.249
No other echo team has
been through here.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.918
Something's not quite right.

11:33.225 --> 11:36.192
Movement!

11:36.193 --> 11:40.196
Check the board.

11:40.197 --> 11:41.132
Negative.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.632
You got us jumping
at shadows, kid.

11:42.633 --> 11:43.941
I'm telling you,
I saw somethin'.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.302
These tunnels will play
tricks with your mind.

11:46.303 --> 11:48.371
We're a hundred feet below
Australia's own area 51.

11:48.372 --> 11:49.906
I think it's justified.

11:49.907 --> 11:52.276
I think you watch
too many movies.

11:52.277 --> 11:54.210
Just keep cool.

11:58.682 --> 12:01.685
Echo 1, we are under attack.

12:01.686 --> 12:03.681
I repeat... Heavy resistance
from base security.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.922
Find us an exit now!

12:05.923 --> 12:06.625
Go, go, go!

12:19.837 --> 12:21.271
Man down, man down!

12:21.272 --> 12:22.407
Get us out of here!

12:24.408 --> 12:26.476
Echo units, stay on mission.

12:26.477 --> 12:29.779
Lights out.
Switch to cans.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.182
Jesus Christ.

12:43.260 --> 12:44.762
Clear.

12:49.601 --> 12:53.671
How's our six looking?

12:53.672 --> 12:55.172
Negative.

13:08.419 --> 13:10.059
Let's go.

13:23.201 --> 13:26.369
Wait.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.206
I've got one external moving 40
meters north adjacent to us.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.907
Fire only on my command.

13:36.447 --> 13:37.716
10 meters from line of sight.

13:47.625 --> 13:48.659
Cease fire!

13:48.660 --> 13:51.061
Move!

13:52.029 --> 13:55.231
Target turning right.

13:55.232 --> 13:56.399
No, wait.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.835
Left.

13:58.836 --> 14:01.171
Dead ahead, 50 meters.

14:01.172 --> 14:02.473
Turning right.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.112
Target has stopped.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.134
It can't be.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.670
It can't be you.

15:06.671 --> 15:09.273
Romeo, wherefore art thou?

15:09.274 --> 15:10.574
Talk to me.

15:10.575 --> 15:11.940
Chief, we're coming in.

15:11.941 --> 15:13.043
Hold your positions.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.388
Do you know who I am?

15:37.702 --> 15:39.403
Do you know who you are?

15:48.947 --> 15:53.182
You're in a facility
200 feet underground.

15:53.183 --> 15:56.552
And I'm here to get you out.

15:56.553 --> 16:00.025
But you have to throw a little
bit of trust my way, o.K.?

16:01.025 --> 16:03.093
Trust you?

16:08.832 --> 16:10.106
Echo team, proceed.

16:16.106 --> 16:17.374
Chief!

16:17.375 --> 16:18.541
Hold your fire!

16:18.542 --> 16:19.810
That's her.
That's tango 8.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.612
I gave you a direct
order, soldier!

16:21.613 --> 16:23.278
Yeah, but they're
not echo daddy's orders.

16:23.279 --> 16:24.579
No, they're mine.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.748
So lower your weapons.

16:25.749 --> 16:27.316
What's going on back there?

16:27.317 --> 16:28.787
Let us in on it, chief.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.854
What's going on?

16:35.659 --> 16:36.594
I got movement!

16:36.595 --> 16:37.728
Talk to me.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.130
We've got another external.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.697
50 meters, coming up our six.

16:41.698 --> 16:43.533
Are you sure?

16:43.534 --> 16:46.070
Wait.

16:46.071 --> 16:51.375
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

16:51.376 --> 16:53.276
I'm sure.
It's a big signal, boss.

16:53.277 --> 16:54.578
This is bullshit.

16:54.579 --> 16:55.711
I'm coming, kid.

16:58.982 --> 16:59.917
40 meters.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.318
Stand down, soldier.

17:01.319 --> 17:03.454
I won't say it again.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.323
20 meters.

17:06.324 --> 17:07.357
Do we have an exit?

17:07.358 --> 17:11.327
It's right above you.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.430
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.839
Oh, you've gotta be
fucking shitting me.

17:29.814 --> 17:30.547
Contact!

17:32.049 --> 17:33.218
No, wiki, you stay back.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.719
You stay back!
Chief!

17:34.952 --> 17:36.619
Do you have a visual?
A visual?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.155
What the hell have they
been doing down here?

17:39.156 --> 17:40.258
Fight or flee, kid?

17:40.259 --> 17:42.159
Flee, definitely flee!

17:42.160 --> 17:43.862
I'm just pissing this thing off!

17:43.863 --> 17:48.132
Jesus Christ!

17:48.133 --> 17:50.233
Magkit, now!

17:50.234 --> 17:52.402
Magkit, magkit now!

17:52.403 --> 17:55.072
Fourpack!

17:55.073 --> 17:56.507
Come on.

17:59.877 --> 18:03.479
Yeah, come on!

18:09.319 --> 18:10.953
Come on, you fucker!

18:16.528 --> 18:17.426
Christ, go in.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.497
You fucking son of a
motherfucking bitch.

18:22.099 --> 18:25.602
Come on, you fucker!

18:25.603 --> 18:26.402
We're clear.

18:26.403 --> 18:27.538
I'll be right behind you.

18:32.509 --> 18:33.409
Wik!

18:36.580 --> 18:37.681
Don't move.

18:37.682 --> 18:38.814
Hurry!

18:38.815 --> 18:40.151
Let's go, kid, let's go!

18:43.688 --> 18:47.089
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

18:49.394 --> 18:50.259
Quickly.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.261
I got you, mate.

18:52.262 --> 18:52.982
Are you all right?

18:53.030 --> 18:54.164
I'm fine, did we stop it?

18:55.866 --> 18:57.433
I don't think so.

18:57.434 --> 18:58.269
You're bleeding.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.505
No, come on, go go go go!

19:01.506 --> 19:02.471
You o.K.?

19:02.472 --> 19:03.173
Come on!

19:03.174 --> 19:04.173
Hurry!

19:17.488 --> 19:21.026
Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis is
leaving the fuckin' building.

19:22.026 --> 19:23.759
I got you.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.728
Yep.

19:24.729 --> 19:25.729
Gotcha.

19:25.730 --> 19:26.529
Come on.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.297
Miss me?

19:33.605 --> 19:36.272
Augh, oh!

19:36.273 --> 19:38.241
Will!

19:38.242 --> 19:40.710
Diane!

19:42.846 --> 19:44.448
Chief, we've gotta do something!

19:44.449 --> 19:45.749
Do something!

19:45.750 --> 19:47.283
Blow the fucker, chief!

19:47.284 --> 19:49.012
Baby, please!
We're going to get you out.

19:49.019 --> 19:52.256
Come on, throw it down!

19:52.257 --> 19:53.690
Blow it.

19:53.691 --> 19:55.592
Blow it!

19:55.593 --> 19:58.029
No, chief!

19:59.029 --> 20:01.632
I love you, baby.

20:06.304 --> 20:07.703
Get off me!

20:07.704 --> 20:09.640
Get off me!

20:33.597 --> 20:35.832
Don't you fucking touch me!

20:35.833 --> 20:36.938
You're pregnant.

20:40.938 --> 20:44.574
How the fuck could
you know that?

20:44.575 --> 20:46.108
How could you
possibly know that?

20:46.109 --> 20:47.178
Wik... - answer me!

20:47.179 --> 20:49.046
Wik?
Answer me!

20:49.047 --> 20:50.048
I need you to calm down
and lower your weapon.

20:50.748 --> 20:52.248
Don't I look calm to you, chief?

20:57.121 --> 20:59.588
You're pregnant.

20:59.589 --> 21:00.424
Echo 3, report.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.392
This is echo daddy, report.

21:02.393 --> 21:03.227
Echo 3, report.

21:03.228 --> 21:04.664
This is echo daddy.

21:07.664 --> 21:11.034
What's going on with you, chief?

21:11.035 --> 21:13.135
We have a history.

21:13.136 --> 21:15.504
<i>We're risking a court martial
'cause you're fucking the target?</i>

21:15.505 --> 21:17.375
It's a little more
complicated than that.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.508
Why?

21:18.509 --> 21:20.177
You fucking the other
targets as well?

21:22.380 --> 21:24.247
You are way out of line.

21:24.248 --> 21:28.451
At least I'm not acting
like I drew it myself.

21:28.452 --> 21:29.786
Fuck this!

21:29.787 --> 21:32.088
Command's orders are to
put this bitch down.

21:32.089 --> 21:34.256
What do you think is gonna
happen when the two of you waltz

21:34.257 --> 21:35.492
out of here hand in hand?

21:35.493 --> 21:38.828
They're gonna fucking kill her.

21:38.829 --> 21:39.863
Hey!

21:39.864 --> 21:40.730
Come on!

21:40.731 --> 21:42.098
Come on!

21:42.099 --> 21:43.532
You and me, baby, come on!

21:43.533 --> 21:44.866
Everyone stand down!

21:44.867 --> 21:46.404
You and me!

21:46.405 --> 21:47.304
Come on.

21:47.305 --> 21:50.507
You too, soldier!

21:50.508 --> 21:52.375
Soldier?

21:52.376 --> 21:58.248
You handle a weapon like one.

21:58.249 --> 21:59.997
You really don't
remember anything?

22:04.588 --> 22:06.856
Eve?

22:06.857 --> 22:14.498
Well, Eve, pointing a gun at my
team is just gonna provoke them.

22:15.501 --> 22:20.470
You have that right.

22:20.471 --> 22:23.373
She's my wife.

22:23.374 --> 22:24.806
Yeah, 'course she is.

22:24.807 --> 22:26.910
And wiki's my pet
cocker spaniel.

22:26.911 --> 22:29.078
Come on.

22:29.079 --> 22:32.114
But she can't be.

22:32.115 --> 22:36.952
My wife drowned.

22:42.492 --> 22:46.095
You should have
stood down, chief.

22:46.096 --> 22:48.198
You put us all in danger.

22:48.199 --> 22:50.366
Knowing the target
compromises the mission.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.067
She came up in the
mission brief.

22:52.068 --> 22:53.237
I had to get to her first.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.470
I had to be sure.

22:54.471 --> 22:57.339
Am I the only one
missing something here?

22:57.340 --> 23:01.412
The army simply forgot that
they were sending you into this

23:01.413 --> 23:06.082
shit-hole to kill your Mrs.?

23:06.083 --> 23:12.788
We go way back, and I don't
remember any wedding bells.

23:14.558 --> 23:16.492
I'm sorry, wik.

23:16.493 --> 23:19.762
I know how hard it
is to lose someone.

23:19.763 --> 23:22.132
Fuck you!

23:33.277 --> 23:36.880
Are you sure it's her?

23:36.881 --> 23:40.217
Absolutely.

23:40.218 --> 23:48.218
I can't explain it...
But it's her.

23:58.869 --> 24:02.605
How are we gonna
get her out of here?

24:02.606 --> 24:05.040
I'm working on it.

24:05.041 --> 24:08.278
Let's just get topside
to the extraction point.

24:08.279 --> 24:14.851
We'll slip away from there
and take our chances.

24:14.852 --> 24:17.653
I'm not asking you to follow us.

24:17.654 --> 24:20.923
But I'm not asking for
permission, either.

24:20.924 --> 24:23.044
Whatever we're dealing with
down here, we'll do better

24:24.028 --> 24:27.329
if we stick together.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.431
All right.

24:30.934 --> 24:34.136
Which way?

24:34.137 --> 24:36.706
Nav map's gone.

24:36.707 --> 24:38.475
Up.

24:38.476 --> 24:43.613
Elevators and doors
will be security coded.

24:43.614 --> 24:48.611
She's coming with us.

25:13.611 --> 25:16.819
Clear.

25:22.819 --> 25:26.122
Why would command send us into a
shit-storm without an umbrella, chief?

25:26.123 --> 25:31.827
Need to know basis, fourpack.

25:31.828 --> 25:34.864
Kinda sounds like something
we might need to know.

25:34.865 --> 25:40.107
So does a pregnancy, corporal.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.643
What about you, sweetheart?

25:46.644 --> 25:51.286
You don't talk much, do you?

25:55.286 --> 25:58.826
Yeah, wiki.

26:01.826 --> 26:07.329
So we were married?

26:07.330 --> 26:10.299
We were stationed
overseas together.

26:10.300 --> 26:13.236
Our cover was newlyweds.

26:16.941 --> 26:20.543
It was France.

26:20.544 --> 26:23.212
Yes.

26:23.213 --> 26:28.183
I can see just... Images,
flashes of things.

26:28.184 --> 26:36.184
- What else?
- Nothing.

26:36.460 --> 26:40.063
Our mission was compromised.

26:40.064 --> 26:44.768
The day we were gonna go away
together where no one could find us.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.269
I slipped away to get something.

26:47.270 --> 26:50.984
When I came back, you were gone.

27:00.984 --> 27:03.420
And you blame yourself?

27:03.421 --> 27:06.221
Every single day.

27:06.222 --> 27:08.026
But now you're here.

27:09.026 --> 27:11.694
But how can I be?

27:11.695 --> 27:15.164
I don't know, but I intend to find out.

27:15.165 --> 27:15.965
Move.

27:19.336 --> 27:22.204
I'll go and make
sure it's clear.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.419
They won't hurt you.

27:49.933 --> 28:11.098
Save me.
Save me.

28:20.064 --> 28:21.964
Hold your fire!

28:21.965 --> 28:23.267
Christ, what the fuck!

28:23.268 --> 28:25.335
What happened?

28:25.336 --> 28:26.236
Oh, Jesus.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.069
Christ, man, what the fuck!

28:28.070 --> 28:29.705
Captain.
What happened?

28:29.706 --> 28:30.805
I just saw something.

28:30.806 --> 28:31.940
I'll tell you what happened.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.344
You trigger-happy troglodytes
nearly killed me!

28:34.345 --> 28:36.772
Take it easy!
It was an accident.

28:36.913 --> 28:37.645
An accident?

28:37.646 --> 28:39.316
Stubbing your toe
is an accident.

28:39.317 --> 28:41.085
This is a fucking disaster!

28:41.086 --> 28:45.989
Calm yourself down.

28:45.990 --> 28:50.593
She's a civilian, chief.

28:50.594 --> 28:52.295
Then it's bloody
murder, isn't it?

28:52.296 --> 28:59.007
Matthews, I think you should listen
to the gentleman with the gun.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.575
Jesus Christ.

29:05.576 --> 29:07.376
What did you do to her?

29:08.244 --> 29:11.156
What the hell have you
franken-fucks been up to down here?

29:11.157 --> 29:11.748
Corporal!

29:11.749 --> 29:14.315
We just lost a man to one of
their science experiments, and

29:14.316 --> 29:19.721
I wanna know what we're up against, and I
reckon you're just the man to tell us.

29:19.722 --> 29:22.760
When you're about to kill a man,
it costs nothing to be polite.

29:33.537 --> 29:36.772
You don't seem as distressed
as your colleague.

29:36.773 --> 29:40.876
He was very attached
to his work.

29:40.877 --> 29:42.778
And what line of work is that?

29:42.779 --> 29:44.646
Safeguarded work.

29:44.647 --> 29:51.125
Beyond your pay
grade... no offense.

29:55.125 --> 30:00.229
Wik, let him go.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.731
Fourpack.

30:02.732 --> 30:05.235
Shoot that one.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.570
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Wait, wait... wait!

30:07.571 --> 30:08.438
No, no!

30:08.439 --> 30:10.940
What are we dealing with?

30:10.941 --> 30:14.409
It's... visual and auditory
hallucinations triggered by a

30:14.410 --> 30:18.213
derangement of the synapsis
and neural enhancements.

30:21.417 --> 30:26.256
I'm two cans short of a sixpack, so let's
try that again in English, dickhead.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.258
Biomechanics.

30:28.259 --> 30:31.972
The application of mechanical
principles to biological systems.

30:37.701 --> 30:38.634
All right.

30:38.635 --> 30:44.908
Matthews... Let him finish.

30:44.909 --> 30:49.945
We'd just finished a radical
brain-grafting procedure.

30:49.946 --> 30:54.019
A procedure on her.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.687
That's when everything went crazy.

30:57.688 --> 31:01.723
An orderly started screaming and
then she killed one of the nurses.

31:01.724 --> 31:05.261
When the base went into lockdown we cut our
way up here into the ducting to escape.

31:05.262 --> 31:06.863
But she's the cause.

31:06.864 --> 31:07.945
You need to get rid of her.

31:08.031 --> 31:09.064
That's enough.

31:09.065 --> 31:10.906
O.K., no, you need
to get rid of her.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.872
<i>That's enough!</i>

31:15.873 --> 31:23.873
I say we waste them all and get the
fuck out of here and call it a day.

31:24.048 --> 31:27.816
You and your men are in
over your heads, captain.

31:27.817 --> 31:29.986
People drown that way.

31:29.987 --> 31:33.389
In my line of work, that's
how we learn to swim.

31:33.390 --> 31:37.893
My pay grade doesn't include
babysitting either, but I have

31:37.894 --> 31:44.566
my orders, so you and your
little convoy are under my wing.

31:44.567 --> 31:50.147
You do exactly what I say
when I say it, understand?

31:58.147 --> 32:01.351
Perfectly.

32:01.352 --> 32:03.219
All right, listen.

32:03.220 --> 32:07.757
Up is out, and that's
where we're going.

32:07.758 --> 32:09.459
Fourpack, you take point.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.834
- Wik, cover our six.
- Got it.

32:11.862 --> 32:13.195
Let's go.

32:46.462 --> 32:50.404
Move.

32:54.404 --> 32:56.119
Come on, move!

33:10.119 --> 33:11.087
So, tell me, doc.

33:11.088 --> 33:12.422
Darius.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.257
Darius Caesar.

33:14.258 --> 33:21.497
How does a woman I know to be dead end up in
a military base under the middle of nowhere?

33:21.498 --> 33:24.637
Eve is a very special girl...

33:24.638 --> 33:30.373
Although how she came to
us is beyond my knowledge.

33:30.374 --> 33:31.071
Come on.

33:31.074 --> 33:33.909
I'm sorry I can't give you the
answers you're looking for.

33:33.910 --> 33:36.745
Well, you must have pissed in
somebody's pockets to attract

33:36.746 --> 33:38.881
the attention of the
brass upstairs.

33:38.882 --> 33:42.451
You strike me as a man who understands
the nature of clandestine work.

33:42.452 --> 33:45.219
What we do here isn't exactly
sanctioned by the government.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.423
Which government?

33:48.192 --> 33:52.127
Fuck.

33:52.128 --> 33:56.369
That was on this level.

34:00.369 --> 34:02.505
Move.

34:02.506 --> 34:03.404
Move it, move it.

34:04.339 --> 34:05.241
For God's sake, get up.

34:05.242 --> 34:07.213
Get up, go.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.918
Move! Get down!

34:17.918 --> 34:19.987
Is this really a smart idea?

34:19.987 --> 34:21.554
Crawling headfirst into mayhem?

34:21.556 --> 34:23.426
That's the way we
enter the world.

34:23.427 --> 34:25.027
May as well go out the same way.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.262
I was a breech birth.

34:27.263 --> 34:29.598
- I think I should head back this way.
- Move!

34:29.599 --> 34:31.299
O.K.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.041
Weasel.

34:50.186 --> 34:52.587
Cease fire, cease fire!

34:52.588 --> 34:53.755
This is echo 3!

34:53.757 --> 34:55.158
Identify yourself.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.360
What do you want?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.005
You're all against me!

35:09.005 --> 35:11.841
It's echo 2 and an unknown.

35:11.842 --> 35:14.343
What's going on?
Are they shooting at us?

35:14.344 --> 35:20.348
Echo 2, this is friendly
echo 3, lower your weapon!

35:25.789 --> 35:30.593
Identify yourself!

35:30.594 --> 35:35.297
Wik, move up.

35:35.298 --> 35:36.233
Cover us here.

35:36.234 --> 35:39.201
Like a rug, chief.

35:39.202 --> 35:41.038
Identify yourself!

35:41.039 --> 35:42.504
Identify yourself!

35:42.505 --> 35:43.805
Show me your hands!

35:43.806 --> 35:47.869
Show me... Show me your hands.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.671
Kill them.

36:48.672 --> 36:52.642
Chief.

36:52.643 --> 36:56.078
Chief.

37:08.891 --> 37:10.892
What happened?

37:10.893 --> 37:12.395
You tell me.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.163
What's going on?

37:14.164 --> 37:15.430
Are we clear?

37:21.804 --> 37:23.772
You keep this to yourself.

37:23.773 --> 37:25.607
Keep what to myself?

37:25.608 --> 37:27.977
I've got no idea
what just happened.

37:27.978 --> 37:30.178
Are we clear?

37:30.179 --> 37:32.080
We're clear.

37:32.081 --> 37:33.348
Move.

37:33.349 --> 37:37.324
Move!

37:40.324 --> 37:43.297
Good luck, Matthews.

37:47.297 --> 37:55.297
Damn it.
One's missing.

37:55.303 --> 37:58.349
Good, leave the
little rat to this maze.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.218
What the hell happened here, chief?

38:10.219 --> 38:12.187
Oh, my God.

38:12.188 --> 38:15.256
It's close-range fire.

38:15.257 --> 38:16.423
They did it to each other.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.660
Yeah, but that
doesn't make any sense.

38:18.661 --> 38:22.297
No, it doesn't.

38:22.298 --> 38:24.866
You got some explaining to do.

38:24.867 --> 38:28.303
I don't exactly know
what to tell you.

38:28.304 --> 38:31.573
That's not good enough, doc.

38:31.574 --> 38:35.877
I've been very reasonable.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.178
But fuck it.

38:37.179 --> 38:38.681
- I've already shot one civilian today.
- No, no, no, wait!

38:39.014 --> 38:40.750
O.K., wait, wait, wait!

38:40.751 --> 38:42.084
Wait.

38:44.221 --> 38:50.293
What if I told you that every
Western world leader is

38:50.294 --> 38:54.730
protected around the clock
by a psychic blocker?

38:55.665 --> 38:58.366
Just like Emily here.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.335
Protected from what?

39:00.336 --> 39:02.738
Outside influences.

39:02.739 --> 39:07.276
Remote viewers, or enablers,
as we've come to call them.

39:07.277 --> 39:08.944
Remote what-ers?

39:08.945 --> 39:10.847
The ability to gather
information from a distant or

39:10.848 --> 39:15.718
unseen target using
paranormal means.

39:15.719 --> 39:18.853
In the '80s, the Soviets
developed a paranormal division

39:18.854 --> 39:22.991
to turn telepathic curiosities like Emily
and Eve here into weapons of espionage.

39:22.992 --> 39:26.962
Now we have to take this threat
seriously, thus project genesis began.

39:26.963 --> 39:27.930
Genesis?

39:27.931 --> 39:31.567
Our own program testing the
validity of psychic combat.

39:31.568 --> 39:33.935
Oh, that's great.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.573
So, we've been sent down here
to pop a bunch of palm readers?

39:37.574 --> 39:40.975
Now make no mistake, this
facility is under psychic attack.

39:40.976 --> 39:42.210
By who?

39:42.211 --> 39:43.645
That guy?

39:43.646 --> 39:45.747
Prisoners just like him.

39:45.748 --> 39:49.717
When you breached this facility, the
security safeguards went down momentarily.

39:49.718 --> 39:52.921
The cells in the quarantine
area were opened.

39:52.922 --> 39:54.656
These were our first
test subjects.

39:54.657 --> 39:57.125
They've proven to be very
difficult to control.

39:57.126 --> 40:02.263
Yeah, no shit.

40:02.264 --> 40:06.334
This is bigger than
you or your men, captain.

40:06.335 --> 40:09.939
There is an invisible
battlefield out there.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.610
Psychic soldiers, able to turn
our enemies against themselves.

40:13.611 --> 40:16.645
A whole frontline replacement.

40:16.646 --> 40:18.848
Jesus Christ, you're insane.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.484
What did they?

40:21.485 --> 40:24.986
Well, one man's genius can be
seen as another man's insanity.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.788
What did you do to me?

40:26.789 --> 40:30.158
<i>It is not what I did to you,
it is what I did for you.</i>

40:30.159 --> 40:35.096
What, a shitty haircut
and a bad stitch job?

40:35.097 --> 40:36.807
When you came to this facility,

40:36.808 --> 40:40.835
you were suffering from chronic
neurological seizures... you were dying.

40:40.836 --> 40:44.025
I had to remove the offending part of
your brain and replace it with a donor's.

40:45.007 --> 40:47.909
The interspecies grafting
procedure you have undergone

40:47.910 --> 40:51.913
has not only saved your life,
it has made you unique.

40:51.914 --> 40:53.082
One of a kind.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.517
The next... - interspecies?

40:55.518 --> 40:57.620
What the hell have
you put in my head?

40:57.621 --> 40:58.721
What the hell?

40:58.722 --> 41:01.256
Why, why, why did
you do this to me?

41:01.257 --> 41:02.758
You volunteered!

41:12.768 --> 41:16.538
You're gonna reverse whatever
the fuck you've done to me!

41:16.539 --> 41:18.573
You're gonna reverse it!

41:18.574 --> 41:19.643
Please!

41:19.644 --> 41:21.643
You'd die if I tried.

41:21.644 --> 41:24.778
Besides, the lab was destroyed
when they stormed this facility.

41:24.779 --> 41:28.340
Eve, we'll find a way, but we've
gotta get out of here first.

41:28.341 --> 41:28.951
No.

41:28.952 --> 41:30.487
You were sent to kill me.

41:30.488 --> 41:34.089
You... no, there's no other way!

41:34.090 --> 41:36.892
Wiki, no!

41:36.893 --> 41:40.261
She is bat-shit crazy
enough to pull that pin.

41:40.262 --> 41:45.267
Whatever it is these pricks have been doing
to her down here, it's made her unstable.

41:45.268 --> 41:46.901
She's right, chief.

41:46.902 --> 41:48.371
We can't trust her.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.272
She'll turn on us.

41:50.273 --> 41:52.040
Or worse.

41:52.041 --> 41:54.482
We'll turn on each other,
like these guys here.

41:55.010 --> 41:59.047
You have no idea how
valuable she is.

41:59.048 --> 42:01.250
She just needs time.

42:01.251 --> 42:04.185
Time to learn to
control her abilities.

42:04.186 --> 42:09.191
Well, time isn't a thing
we've got a whole lot of.

42:09.192 --> 42:12.361
This belongs here.

42:12.362 --> 42:14.340
You can find your own way out.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.880
Piece of advice, captain.

42:31.880 --> 42:38.187
If you find yourself going through hell...
Just keep going.

42:38.188 --> 42:42.625
Yeah, I'll send you a postcard.

43:15.791 --> 43:17.558
Saw.

43:24.768 --> 43:28.437
This'll be over
before you know it.

43:56.432 --> 43:58.035
This situation is fubar, chief.

44:03.039 --> 44:08.743
I don't know if these shafts are
getting smaller or I'm getting fatter.

44:08.744 --> 44:11.480
Can't we just get
out of here, chief?

44:11.481 --> 44:13.415
Take the elevator?

44:13.416 --> 44:15.884
We're one man down
with a civilian in tow.

44:15.885 --> 44:21.355
Base security will cut
us down like flies.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.005
What's the go with you
and blondie locks?

44:36.005 --> 44:39.374
You ever felt like you've
been given a second chance?

44:39.375 --> 44:40.374
What do you mean?

44:41.444 --> 44:44.113
Can you hear that?

44:44.114 --> 44:46.448
To go back.

44:46.449 --> 44:49.785
Wash away a moment in time.

44:53.289 --> 44:59.328
I'm not following you, chief.

44:59.329 --> 45:00.195
It's nothing.

45:00.196 --> 45:01.462
Forget about it.

45:07.036 --> 45:09.005
It's a dog.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.674
We could just leave her here.

45:12.675 --> 45:14.776
Out of sight, out of mind.

45:14.777 --> 45:16.443
It's a fuckin' dog.

45:16.444 --> 45:17.413
- What?
- Wiki.

45:17.414 --> 45:19.547
Talk to me.

45:19.548 --> 45:20.349
It's staring at me.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.350
It's staring right at me.

45:24.920 --> 45:28.159
Wiki.

45:37.567 --> 45:38.533
Wik!

45:38.534 --> 45:39.936
What the hell are you doing?

45:39.937 --> 45:42.104
Oh, my God!

45:42.105 --> 45:43.007
Chief, help me!

45:44.007 --> 45:45.207
Chief!

45:45.208 --> 45:46.642
Help me!

45:48.744 --> 45:50.312
Shoot, please shoot it!

45:50.313 --> 45:52.648
Shoot what?
There's nothing there, soldier!

45:55.318 --> 45:57.419
Chief!

45:57.420 --> 45:58.587
Shoot it!

46:03.827 --> 46:05.426
God!

46:05.427 --> 46:07.863
No!

46:44.333 --> 46:48.507
Authorization accepted.

46:51.507 --> 46:53.741
Move, go right now!

46:53.742 --> 46:55.275
Here they come.
Move, move!

46:55.276 --> 46:57.178
On the left, on the
left, on the left!

46:57.179 --> 46:58.881
Let's go!

46:58.882 --> 47:00.415
We need a way out!
Move!

47:05.454 --> 47:09.632
Activation of
fire-prevention measures.

47:15.632 --> 47:18.966
Move it, soldier!

47:18.967 --> 47:21.335
Let's go, soldier, keep moving!

47:27.210 --> 47:28.744
Stay with me, big guy!

47:33.983 --> 47:35.484
Ah, fuck!

47:38.588 --> 47:40.488
Someone's playing with us.
Augh... move!

47:41.023 --> 47:43.797
Go, go, go!

47:48.797 --> 47:56.797
Move, move, move!
Turn back!

48:04.047 --> 48:06.547
Fire in the hole.

48:10.719 --> 48:12.788
Yes.

48:15.123 --> 48:17.392
Someone's looking after us.

48:20.028 --> 48:22.397
Why did you save them, Darius?

48:22.398 --> 48:26.167
I think the Valiant captain might
still be of some use to us.

48:29.905 --> 48:33.241
Ugh, we're not out
of the woods yet.

48:33.242 --> 48:34.242
Looks like we've got a c-o-2

48:34.243 --> 48:35.012
problem.

48:49.192 --> 48:54.930
Where are you, Eve?
Where are you?

48:54.931 --> 48:55.731
There.

49:19.454 --> 49:22.723
What is your situation?
Listen, we had a deal.

49:22.724 --> 49:25.992
I've got the information you needed... I
need you to get me the fuck out of here.

49:25.993 --> 49:27.896
An instruction team
has been dispatched.

49:28.030 --> 49:30.232
Your instruction team
almost killed me!

49:30.233 --> 49:32.099
Please hold while
I transfer you.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.036
Can you hear me?

49:33.037 --> 49:36.572
Hello?? Fuck!
Fuck.

49:40.076 --> 49:43.345
Come on, hurry up.

49:44.547 --> 49:45.946
Stay back.

49:45.947 --> 49:47.181
Please.

49:47.182 --> 49:49.618
What are you afraid of?

49:49.619 --> 49:52.120
You have no idea what
you're capable of.

49:52.121 --> 49:56.223
And to me that makes you much
more dangerous than if you did.

49:56.224 --> 49:57.826
Matthews.

49:59.529 --> 50:01.997
I think you've just signed
your death warrant.

50:01.998 --> 50:06.168
I have this burning feeling
that I... that I wouldn't have willingly

50:06.902 --> 50:14.308
given myself over... To be an
experiment, a medical freak.

50:14.309 --> 50:16.143
Well, part of you did.

50:16.144 --> 50:19.915
And... part of you didn't.

50:19.916 --> 50:24.218
Not gonna lie to you,
mate, it's gonna be tight.

50:30.092 --> 50:31.826
No way.

50:31.827 --> 50:34.729
I don't think I can do that.

50:34.730 --> 50:37.499
Is there a problem, soldier?

50:37.500 --> 50:40.267
Well, let's just say I
used to be a fat kid.

50:40.268 --> 50:41.904
Would you rather suffocate?

50:41.905 --> 50:43.539
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

50:43.972 --> 50:47.109
Shut up and get your
fat arse up the pipe.

50:56.552 --> 51:01.656
Everything feels wrong.

51:01.657 --> 51:07.328
This body, my hair,
these thoughts.

51:07.329 --> 51:08.930
They're not my own.

51:08.931 --> 51:11.764
Cell to cell communication
between donors is not uncommon.

51:11.765 --> 51:14.070
It's like putting two hard
drives into the same computer.

51:17.806 --> 51:20.411
Fuck.

51:35.724 --> 51:37.826
You through, big guy?

51:37.827 --> 51:42.297
Fuckin' shafts weren't exactly
designed for the portly gentleman.

51:44.699 --> 51:48.870
That's lucky for you...

51:48.871 --> 51:50.805
'Cause you're no gentleman.

51:50.806 --> 51:54.975
Yeah, lucky I can barely move
'cause I'd punch you in the face.

52:04.286 --> 52:07.389
Would I still have died if
I hadn't have gone through the operation?

52:07.390 --> 52:08.857
Died?

52:08.858 --> 52:13.060
What are you talking about?

52:13.061 --> 52:15.397
Caesar.

52:15.398 --> 52:18.265
...he said I was dying.

52:18.266 --> 52:20.369
- Dying?
- Far from it.

52:21.003 --> 52:24.672
You came to us as one of the
most gifted remote viewers we'd ever seen.

52:24.673 --> 52:29.076
Troubled, yeah... But
definitely not dying.

52:32.514 --> 52:35.317
Darius wanted to amplify your
abilities, combining two

52:35.318 --> 52:37.085
telepaths via direct
neural grafting.

52:37.086 --> 52:40.255
He figured that a soldier,
like yourself, who was used to

52:40.256 --> 52:45.392
taking orders, would be...
Easier to control.

52:47.663 --> 52:50.732
Easier to control?

52:53.469 --> 52:57.378
The other telepath donor was
less than willing, so to speak.

53:02.378 --> 53:08.183
I was against it from the
start, for what it's worth.

53:08.184 --> 53:09.850
Is that the donor?

53:09.851 --> 53:13.321
I, um, I really wouldn't
do that if I were you.

53:20.929 --> 53:22.597
You're not ready for that.

53:26.802 --> 53:29.770
I can feel it.

53:29.771 --> 53:35.076
I can feel it just
beneath the surface.

53:35.077 --> 53:38.312
Oh, no.

53:38.313 --> 53:39.913
I wanna go back.

53:39.914 --> 53:42.116
I just wanna go back
to the way I was.

53:42.117 --> 53:44.618
That's gonna be a lot more
difficult than you can ever imagine.

53:44.619 --> 53:47.288
Why?

53:47.289 --> 53:52.798
Because your memories are
lying in a petri dish.

54:00.135 --> 54:01.615
...this is a preliminary interview

54:01.616 --> 54:03.704
with corporal Sandra
bloom before the hearing.

54:03.705 --> 54:06.174
Please state your full name
and rank for the camera.

54:06.175 --> 54:10.544
Fuck you... sir.

54:10.545 --> 54:14.050
This is... just a
little formality to assess your

54:14.051 --> 54:18.152
mental state before, uh, your court
martial on the charges of desertion.

54:18.153 --> 54:19.385
I'm trying to help you.

54:19.386 --> 54:21.222
There's no need to be hostile.

54:26.594 --> 54:30.665
Can you tell me why
you tried to kill yourself?

54:30.666 --> 54:34.169
Not myself.

54:35.871 --> 54:38.372
The others.

54:38.373 --> 54:40.075
Inside.

54:40.076 --> 54:43.845
Inside... inside your head?

54:43.846 --> 54:48.616
Too many people.

54:49.719 --> 54:51.618
Too many voices.

54:51.619 --> 54:56.624
So you shot
yourself to stop the voices?

54:56.625 --> 54:59.727
I had to let them out.

54:59.728 --> 55:02.897
How else are they
meant to get out?

55:02.898 --> 55:05.933
They needed a door to get out.

55:05.934 --> 55:08.370
Did it stop the voices?

55:08.371 --> 55:11.506
Did you get them out?

55:11.507 --> 55:16.243
Can you hear them now?

55:16.244 --> 55:18.779
I can still hear your voice.

55:18.780 --> 55:21.649
Even when your lips
aren't moving.

55:21.650 --> 55:24.585
We can stop the voices.

55:24.586 --> 55:26.789
And these charges against you,
we can make them disappear.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.223
Do you understand?

55:30.059 --> 55:33.028
O.K., but
you have to trust us.

55:34.028 --> 55:36.831
You also need to understand
that your body and mind become

55:36.832 --> 55:40.166
property of this facility until
deemed fit for service by

55:40.167 --> 55:43.804
operation genesis facilitator
Dr. Darius Caesar or appropriate

55:43.805 --> 55:46.508
ranked officer outlined in
said operational brief.

55:49.644 --> 55:51.493
- ...I need a pen.
- Of course.

55:56.952 --> 55:58.353
Is there a problem, corporal?

56:02.224 --> 56:03.773
- Where do I sign?
- Just here.

57:05.721 --> 57:08.589
Access denied.

57:08.590 --> 57:12.893
Access denied.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.847
Your trigger-happy boyfriend
should've gotten rid of you

57:33.848 --> 57:34.949
when he had the chance.

57:36.719 --> 57:38.818
I didn't spend four years
underground playing second

57:38.819 --> 57:42.890
fiddle to a man with a
God complex for nothing.

57:45.527 --> 57:48.395
This is my retirement.

58:07.349 --> 58:14.288
[Breathes strangely,

58:14.289 --> 58:17.457
You get out of my fucking head.

58:20.094 --> 58:21.428
Augh!

58:32.907 --> 58:36.778
Get out of my fucking head.

58:43.085 --> 58:45.720
No!

58:48.023 --> 58:50.991
Get out!

59:09.077 --> 59:09.821
Come on.

59:17.518 --> 59:20.355
Come on.

59:30.833 --> 59:33.600
[Breathing changes to

59:33.601 --> 59:35.703
Darius, are we going now?

59:35.704 --> 59:36.904
Shh.

59:36.905 --> 59:40.408
Darius, I won't be able
to block her soon.

59:40.409 --> 59:42.110
Her abilities are quickening.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.510
Emergency.

01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:19.680
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:00:19.681 --> 01:00:21.649
Containment protocols
are active.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:25.553
You now have... 15...
minutes to evacuate.

01:00:25.554 --> 01:00:27.921
Time to go, my dear.

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:29.088
Emergency.

01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:31.392
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:33.493
Containment protocols
are active.

01:00:33.494 --> 01:00:35.696
Containment protocols?

01:00:35.697 --> 01:00:38.533
What do you think's gonna
happen in 15 minutes?

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:42.437
We don't want to be
here to find out.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:04.731
Just keep moving, big guy.

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:13.334
Hey, chief.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:16.770
We've been through
some crazy shit.

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:20.274
That stuff that happened
before with wiki, that was...

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:25.212
I mean, what would make somebody do
something like that to themselves?

01:01:25.213 --> 01:01:26.412
Emergency.

01:01:26.413 --> 01:01:28.750
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.285
Containment protocols
are active.

01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:34.122
I've seen some things
down here that I can't explain.

01:01:35.923 --> 01:01:38.826
Let's just concentrate on getting
ourselves out of here, o.K.?

01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:44.464
I've found an exit!

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.803
We're almost there, big guy.

01:01:49.804 --> 01:01:53.640
Just think of the cold beer I'm
gonna buy when we get out of here.

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:57.444
I think I'm gonna cut back
on the beers from now on.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:29.843
Hey, chief.

01:02:29.844 --> 01:02:37.084
Hey, you believe in all
that fortune teller shit?

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.886
Just keep moving!

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:40.721
We're almost there!

01:02:40.722 --> 01:02:43.424
Once we get through here,
we'll be home free!

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:45.926
Just keep moving!

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:07.582
Fourpack!

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.049
Eve is here!

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.852
Fuck me.

01:03:13.454 --> 01:03:15.255
There's a fire underneath us!

01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:16.657
It's in your head, mate!

01:03:16.658 --> 01:03:18.158
No, there's a fire!

01:03:18.159 --> 01:03:19.193
There's a fire underneath us!

01:03:19.194 --> 01:03:20.694
Just keep moving!

01:03:23.297 --> 01:03:27.067
Eve, please, if you
can stop this.

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.970
He won't touch you.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.904
<i>No.</i>

01:03:30.905 --> 01:03:33.741
<i>He wants to kill me.</i>

01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:34.808
Fourpack!

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:37.658
Just tell her you
won't hurt her.

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.913
I'll kill the bitch!

01:03:39.914 --> 01:03:42.617
Eve... please...
Please!

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.986
Help!

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.088
Come on, man, stick with me.

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:48.055
Come on, stick with me.

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:49.223
Eddie!

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:52.326
Eddie!

01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:55.462
Just stop thinking about it
and it'll go away, trust me.

01:04:09.177 --> 01:04:11.312
Eve!

01:04:11.313 --> 01:04:12.413
Please!

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:16.049
Help me!

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:17.584
Help!

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:19.085
Eddie!

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:24.292
For the love of God.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:27.528
I can't take die like this.

01:04:27.529 --> 01:04:28.963
Fourpack, come on, man.

01:04:28.964 --> 01:04:31.031
Come on, stick with me!

01:04:31.032 --> 01:04:32.332
Stick with me, man.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:33.600
Eve, please!

01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:34.734
Please!

01:04:34.735 --> 01:04:36.737
You tell my kids I love them!

01:04:36.738 --> 01:04:38.738
Noooo!!

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.793
You do that!
Eddie!

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.540
Are you all right?

01:05:53.347 --> 01:05:54.749
O.K.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:59.319
What are you doing?

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.759
This isn't easy.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.160
O.K.

01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:08.663
You're not the one about to
get a bullet in the face.

01:06:10.565 --> 01:06:16.537
I should have done it when
I first laid eyes on you.

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:21.542
I'm sorry.

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:24.444
[Sniffles, cocks pistol,

01:06:26.981 --> 01:06:32.386
[Breathes strangely,

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:36.357
<i>I know your secret.</i>

01:06:36.358 --> 01:06:37.691
<i>It was you.</i>

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:42.030
No... no...

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.031
<i>You did this to me.</i>

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:48.803
It can't be you.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.337
It can't be.

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:54.140
<i>But I can make it all go away.</i>

01:06:54.141 --> 01:06:56.977
<i>The guilt...</i>

01:06:56.978 --> 01:07:00.980
<i>The loneliness.</i>

01:07:00.981 --> 01:07:01.849
But it can't be you.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.917
You're dead.

01:07:03.918 --> 01:07:06.553
Jesus Christ.

01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:09.122
<i>You can save me this time.</i>

01:07:09.123 --> 01:07:12.058
<i>You can save me this time.</i>

01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:14.794
<i>Save... me.</i>

01:07:20.735 --> 01:07:21.867
Emergency.

01:07:21.868 --> 01:07:24.105
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.406
Containment protocols
are active.

01:07:26.407 --> 01:07:27.607
Yeah.

01:07:27.608 --> 01:07:28.741
I can save you.

01:07:28.742 --> 01:07:33.413
<i>I forgive you.</i>

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:34.881
I can.

01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:36.951
I can save you.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.752
<i>Save me.</i>

01:07:42.356 --> 01:07:45.158
<i>Save me.</i>

01:07:45.159 --> 01:07:47.328
That's enough.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.729
It's over.

01:07:50.731 --> 01:07:52.431
It's time for us to go, my dear.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:59.839
I am very proud of you.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.841
Proud?

01:08:01.842 --> 01:08:04.044
All my men are dead.

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:06.148
Their deaths will prevent
millions of others.

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:08.549
They performed admirably.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.118
You son of a bitch.

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:19.292
As an assassin, captain, you
were sent down here to kill

01:08:19.294 --> 01:08:23.429
people, whereas I'm
trying to save them.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.466
And me?

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:30.702
Unsettling as this has been, the
attack on this facility was

01:08:30.703 --> 01:08:34.508
advantageous in field
testing your potential.

01:08:34.509 --> 01:08:38.379
We need to learn how to use
and control your abilities.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.179
In time, it will
become easier for you.

01:08:41.015 --> 01:08:42.782
No.

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:44.652
She's not going
anywhere with you.

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:50.357
You willingly signed yourself
over for this project.

01:08:50.358 --> 01:08:53.827
<i>No... I didn't.</i>

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:54.993
Emergency.

01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:57.296
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:08:57.298 --> 01:08:59.032
Containment protocols
are active.

01:08:59.033 --> 01:09:02.870
As you can hear, we don't
have time to argue.

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:06.907
There's an exit just down
there that leads outside.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:09.510
You must let us finish
what we started.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:25.259
You want to get in
here, don't you?

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.631
<i>Romeo...</i>

01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:34.300
<i>Take us out of here.</i>

01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:36.005
<i>Shoot him.</i>

01:09:37.005 --> 01:09:38.671
<i>We can be together again.</i>

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:43.376
Memory fabrications.

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:47.814
Intensive non-lucid
hallucinations in third parties.

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:49.176
Enough with the
fucking bio-babble.

01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:50.738
No, no, listen!

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.185
Listen, captain!

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:55.220
Eve has implanted herself
into an old memory of yours.

01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:57.691
Before today, the two
of you have never met.

01:09:57.692 --> 01:09:59.926
You have never even
crossed paths!

01:09:59.927 --> 01:10:03.830
It's a defense mechanism,
erasing any doubt in you that

01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:07.568
the woman you were sent to kill
is a past lover.

01:10:07.569 --> 01:10:10.572
Consciously or not, Eve is
protecting herself, like a

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:13.506
chameleon adapting
to its surroundings.

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:17.012
Only in this case, she's using
your memory as a camouflage.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:19.611
<i>He's lying.</i>

01:10:19.612 --> 01:10:22.750
Think hard about your past
history with her, captain.

01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:07.794
Emergency.

01:11:07.795 --> 01:11:09.962
Structural integrity
compromised.

01:11:09.963 --> 01:11:12.566
Containment protocols
are active.

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:22.076
A lost love, who you were told betrayed
her country and your confidence.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.711
Your loyalty put to the test.

01:11:33.887 --> 01:11:38.224
She was innocent.

01:11:38.225 --> 01:11:42.328
It's a heavy burden
to carry for any man.

01:11:42.329 --> 01:11:46.899
How could you know this?

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.969
<i>No.</i>

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:54.608
<i>No, you were going to
ask me to marry you.</i>

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:59.910
It's not only his mind
you need to convince...

01:11:59.911 --> 01:12:01.715
It's his heart.

01:12:01.716 --> 01:12:06.386
She is going to
make us so proud.

01:12:06.387 --> 01:12:10.924
With this kind of power, do
you know what we can learn?

01:12:10.925 --> 01:12:15.496
Our enemy's thoughts before
they even think of them.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.097
We can plant our own thoughts
into the minds of terrorists

01:12:18.098 --> 01:12:20.133
instead of them planting bombs.

01:12:20.134 --> 01:12:24.170
We can become
like puppet masters...

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:27.205
Pulling the strings of
dictators and tyrants.

01:12:27.206 --> 01:12:32.345
<i>And when we control them,
we control everything.</i>

01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:41.948
War is too serious a matter to be
entrusted to the military, captain.

01:12:44.658 --> 01:12:51.532
You... You need to
see this from my perspective.

01:12:57.404 --> 01:13:01.308
<i>No.</i>

01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:03.644
<i>You need to see it from mine.</i>

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:08.982
Do you realize
what you just did?

01:13:08.983 --> 01:13:12.185
<i>Are you out of your
fucking mind?!</i>

01:13:15.289 --> 01:13:19.158
No... Wait, Eve.

01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:20.327
Please.

01:13:23.297 --> 01:13:24.965
Please.

01:13:24.966 --> 01:13:30.237
I'll... I'll
do anything you want.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.109
Eve!

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.812
Please!

01:13:58.533 --> 01:13:59.966
Aaah!

01:14:29.497 --> 01:14:33.099
<i>Don't even think about it.</i>

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.969
You're too dangerous.

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:39.805
<i>Don't feel sorry for him.</i>

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:41.509
<i>He deserved what he
got, believe me.</i>

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:43.175
<i>He was the monster.</i>

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:48.881
What are you?

01:14:48.882 --> 01:14:53.653
<i>I don't know what I am.</i>

01:14:53.654 --> 01:14:58.425
<i>But I'm not her.</i>

01:14:58.426 --> 01:15:00.093
No, you're not.

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:08.635
<i>I am a little jealous
of her, though.</i>

01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:14.140
<i>The woman you loved so much...</i>

01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:18.778
<i>That you would sacrifice
everything to save her.</i>

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:22.215
Oh, stop it.

01:15:22.216 --> 01:15:23.885
<i>Your duty to your country.</i>

01:15:25.485 --> 01:15:27.955
<i>Your friends.</i>

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:31.058
Stop it, please!

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:38.732
<i>She was truly beautiful.</i>

01:15:44.538 --> 01:15:47.707
<i>And you were happy.</i>

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:50.042
<i>Happier than you've
ever been before.</i>

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:58.150
Please!
I didn't betray you!

01:15:58.151 --> 01:15:59.087
Don't listen to them.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:00.286
I didn't do it!

01:16:00.287 --> 01:16:01.389
Don't listen to them!

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.323
<i>You were deceived.</i>

01:16:04.324 --> 01:16:05.726
I love you!

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:08.260
I love you!

01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:10.730
<i>Your loyalty questioned.</i>

01:16:48.336 --> 01:16:56.076
<i>But her love for you was real.</i>

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.419
Oh, oh please, stop it!

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.921
...you ever feel like you've
been given a second chance?

01:17:10.557 --> 01:17:17.496
To come back... Wash
away a moment in time...

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.334
<i>The ring!</i>

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:30.744
Yeah... I was going
to propose to her

01:17:30.745 --> 01:17:35.348
that day...

01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:38.350
We were gonna disappear.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:39.720
You have it with you?

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.569
You wanna see it?

01:18:21.529 --> 01:18:29.202
I never got the chance to say
the words to her myself.

01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:31.409
But I suppose you'll do.

01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:39.179
Till death do us part.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.849
Oh!

01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:01.401
Saw.

01:19:08.309 --> 01:19:09.810
This will be over
before you know it.

01:20:21.148 --> 01:20:22.214
