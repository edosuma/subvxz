00:32.250 --> 00:35.041
Well, thank God that
crazy mix-up is over.

00:35.083 --> 00:36.583
We've got
Steve back,

00:36.625 --> 00:38.750
and you've got your
boy-shaped ruby.

00:38.792 --> 00:41.208
Well, I guess this is good-bye,
Smiths.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.000
But, seriously,
if you're ever in Tehran...

00:44.041 --> 00:45.542
stay out of Tehran!

00:55.041 --> 00:58.041
Now that that's all done,
I'll get breakfast started.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.750
I don't know why I even bother
to set a place for Hayley.

01:02.792 --> 01:05.875
She's been so depressed, she
hasn't left her room in weeks.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.542
Guess what happened
one year ago today?

01:08.583 --> 01:10.917
Is that the day I gave myself
one year to find happiness,

01:10.959 --> 01:12.083
or I'd kill us all?

01:12.125 --> 01:13.583
No, that was yesterday.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.000
It was?

01:15.041 --> 01:17.000
Ho-ho-ho, lucky.

01:17.041 --> 01:18.041
You were first!

01:18.083 --> 01:20.792
No! Today's
the one-year anniversary

01:20.834 --> 01:23.375
of when I almost left Earth,
but decided to stay!

01:23.417 --> 01:25.625
You mean,
the one-year anniversary

01:25.667 --> 01:28.083
of you pushing Jeff
into that alien ship

01:28.125 --> 01:30.875
and him being sucked
into space.

01:30.917 --> 01:33.750
That's why Hayley's been so sad.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.375
She must be missing Jeff.

01:35.417 --> 01:39.000
Then she should come look at
this, 'cause he's right here!

01:39.041 --> 01:40.792
Francine, I maxed out
your credit card

01:40.834 --> 01:43.709
to hire Buddy Valastro
from Cake Boss to make this.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.583
And, Stan, I maxed out your
credit card to hire Buddy

01:46.625 --> 01:49.333
to make this cake
of me ordering the first cake.

01:49.375 --> 01:53.500
I saw Roger ordering the cake,
and trust me, that is dead on.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.792
Honey, I brought you breakfast.

01:57.834 --> 02:01.166
Also, we haven't done
an are-you-alive check today.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.625
I'm not hungry.

02:02.667 --> 02:03.792
Put them
with the rest.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.291
Honey, I know it's been a year
since Jeff was abducted,

02:08.333 --> 02:10.709
and that's hitting you
pretty hard.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.166
But don't you think it's time
you got out of this room

02:13.208 --> 02:15.125
and started living
your life again?

02:15.166 --> 02:17.750
I'll never
forget Jeff!

02:20.792 --> 02:22.417
Oh, you made a big one!

02:22.458 --> 02:25.000
Thanks for using the newspaper
this time.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.792
Covered the whole
comics section.

02:27.834 --> 02:28.834
Bet that's not the first time

02:28.875 --> 02:30.875
Cathy's had that done
on her face.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.458
This is it, Snot.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.875
Today, we meet the girl who's
gonna take our virginities.

02:37.917 --> 02:40.166
And we're gonna find
that girl with this!

02:40.208 --> 02:41.166
What is it?

02:41.208 --> 02:43.166
It's my dad's
old CB radio!

02:44.458 --> 02:45.917
Breaker, breaker.

02:45.959 --> 02:48.875
This is two 14-year-old boys
looking for two special gals.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.000
Oh, ten-four!

02:51.083 --> 02:53.709
I'd treat you boys real nice.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.333
I'm not a woman exactly,

02:55.375 --> 02:57.667
but I can get my hands
on the parts you guys are after.

02:57.709 --> 03:00.709
It's all lonely,
male truckers.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.417
Are you boys still there?

03:02.458 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, we're here!

03:04.041 --> 03:05.959
Be cool.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.166
Are you hot?!

03:07.208 --> 03:10.291
Well, if you're talking
about looks, yes.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.375
If you're talking about gambling
on college basketball,

03:13.417 --> 03:15.792
I am ice cold.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.667
Stupid DePaul,
can't hit a free throw.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.542
You boys want to meet up?

03:20.583 --> 03:21.834
I'll be at...

03:23.250 --> 03:24.583
...find me quite limber.

03:25.709 --> 03:28.000
Ma'am? Ma'am,
are you there?!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.083
Oh, she's gone!

03:29.125 --> 03:31.208
We need to get
her signal back!

03:31.250 --> 03:34.667
You boys want to see
a 400-pound man rise out

03:34.709 --> 03:36.750
of his overalls
like a phoenix?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.125
Oh, this can't end well.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.250
Says here they taught
an ape how to read.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.625
I'm assuming, based on the
photo next to all these words.

03:46.667 --> 03:50.250
Stan, I'm worried about Hayley,
all cooped up in her room.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.959
Maybe we should get a therapist
to help coax her out.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.792
A therapist?
Sounds expensive.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.333
What if I told you I could
smoke her out of her room

03:57.375 --> 03:59.458
for a fraction
of the cost?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.041
Stan, what
were you thinking?!

04:02.083 --> 04:05.375
Well, first I thought I'd smoke
her out with a controlled fire.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.959
Then I lit the fire.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.458
Then I thought, "I don't know
how to control fire."

04:13.500 --> 04:15.834
Hayley, when they told
you to feel the burn,

04:15.875 --> 04:19.583
I think they were
talking about exercise!

04:19.625 --> 04:21.166
I shouldn't
joke about this.

04:21.208 --> 04:22.750
I did this.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.792
We'll see you
tomorrow, honey.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.125
Why don't you get
a real job, loser!

04:29.166 --> 04:30.625
Yeah, you're just
a dumb janitor.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.834
We're doctors.
Doctors rule!

04:32.875 --> 04:35.417
Go... doctors!

04:35.458 --> 04:38.417
Hey, Janitor, you should get
that checked out by a doctor.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.125
Hey, I'm a doctor!

04:40.166 --> 04:41.667
It's bad news.

04:41.709 --> 04:42.750
You're a loser!

04:42.792 --> 04:44.208
Doctors rule!

04:44.250 --> 04:46.625
Hey, just because
he's a janitor doesn't mean

04:46.667 --> 04:48.250
you can kick him
in the nards.

04:48.291 --> 04:49.500
Leave him alone!

04:49.542 --> 04:50.583
Forget this.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.250
Let's go hit on
some cancer chicks.

04:54.291 --> 04:57.709
Wow. That was really sweet
of you to stand up for me.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.208
I'm Millionaire
Matt Davis.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.083
Millionaire Matt Davis?

05:01.125 --> 05:02.291
Is that your real name?

05:02.333 --> 05:04.166
Yeah, my mom had
high hopes for me.

05:04.208 --> 05:07.250
And I exceeded them
by 380 million.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.250
Hayley. It's nice
to meet you.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.500
But wait. If you're
a multimillionaire,

05:11.542 --> 05:13.083
why are you working
as a janitor?

05:13.125 --> 05:16.000
Well, when I'm not running my
many charitable organizations,

05:16.041 --> 05:18.917
I use my fortune
to live life to the fullest.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.208
Wow.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.250
Yeah, every day,

05:21.291 --> 05:22.834
I tackle a new,
amazing experience.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.041
I mean, you know, being a
janitor is a bad example,

05:25.083 --> 05:26.500
but Monday,
I flew a jet.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.375
Tuesday, I rocked-climbed
in Thailand.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.417
And Wednesday, I
worked at GameStop.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.625
Gosh, it all sounds
so exciting!

05:32.667 --> 05:35.000
Well, maybe one day,
I can take you along

05:35.041 --> 05:36.542
on one of my
adventures.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.458
You ever have to kill
sick dogs for the city?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.667
Maybe not that one.

05:40.709 --> 05:41.625
No, not that one.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.041
But we'll think
of something.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.125
Oops.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.458
Hey, look at me!

05:59.208 --> 06:03.208
Wow. That was most amazing trip
home from the hospital ever.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.709
Mom, Dad, this is
Millionaire Matt Davis.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.542
We met
in the burn ward.

06:07.583 --> 06:08.917
A millionaire?!

06:08.959 --> 06:11.458
Okay, okay, okay, what is
premium gasoline like?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.917
Does it smell as good
as I think it does?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.417
What's that?

06:16.458 --> 06:18.583
Hayley told me about the fire!

06:18.625 --> 06:19.834
I wouldn't be a good guest

06:19.834 --> 06:21.875
if I didn't bring something
for my hosts.

06:27.583 --> 06:31.291
Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much!

06:31.333 --> 06:34.667
Did someone just drop
a house on me?!

06:34.709 --> 06:37.125
Sure, my life
is adventurous,

06:37.166 --> 06:39.375
but if you don't have
someone to share it with,

06:39.417 --> 06:40.917
what's the point?

06:40.959 --> 06:41.917
Aw...

06:41.959 --> 06:43.083
You're
so rich!

06:43.125 --> 06:44.500
Well, sorry to
cut this short,

06:44.542 --> 06:45.625
but I gotta
get going.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.917
Today I'm going
to be a pro golfer.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.375
Worst
on tour.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.750
That shirt costs more than
this house, doesn't it?

06:51.792 --> 06:52.959
Please let
the answer be yes.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.750
And I'll see
you tomorrow.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.583
Scuba-brunch!

06:58.709 --> 06:59.834
Wow.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.250
Oh, he makes me feel so alive!

07:02.291 --> 07:04.834
You know, I didn't think
I could ever imagine

07:04.875 --> 07:06.792
a life without
Jeff, but...

07:06.834 --> 07:08.667
maybe I'm finally
ready to try.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.125
Oh, Hayley,
that's wonderful!

07:11.166 --> 07:12.333
Damn.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.083
I forgot to ask him
if he knows Scrooge McDuck.

07:14.125 --> 07:15.750
Hayley, come quick!

07:15.792 --> 07:18.500
Snot and I were playing
with Dad's old CB radio,

07:18.542 --> 07:19.834
for reasons you
don't need to know,

07:19.875 --> 07:23.125
and I came across a signal
from really far away.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.208
Um, h-hello?

07:25.250 --> 07:27.000
Hey, babe! It's me!

07:27.041 --> 07:28.125
I'm alive!

07:28.166 --> 07:29.125
Jeff?!

07:29.166 --> 07:31.083
Oh, my God,
is-is that really you?

07:31.125 --> 07:32.709
Jeffinitely!
Get it?

07:32.750 --> 07:35.083
It's like "definitely,"
but with my name!

07:35.125 --> 07:36.875
It is you!

07:36.917 --> 07:39.166
Hey, I was out
test-driving some Saturns.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.041
You know,
narrowing it down.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.875
Whoa, did we
get a new house?

07:48.667 --> 07:51.917
And then Sinbad
sacrificed himself

07:51.959 --> 07:54.250
so I could escape
the alien space station,

07:54.291 --> 07:56.458
and me and his ghost have been
traveling the stars

07:56.500 --> 07:58.625
looking for a way home
ever since.

07:58.667 --> 08:01.083
You guys, Jeff
is still alive

08:01.125 --> 08:02.792
in space and
almost home!

08:02.834 --> 08:05.458
Actually, babe, we have
no idea where we are.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.208
Yo, Jeff, ask her
what she's wearing.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.291
No, ask her if she's
seen Houseguest.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.166
Hayley, Sinbad wants to know...

08:13.542 --> 08:14.834
Hayley?

08:14.875 --> 08:16.125
I'm losing my signal.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.542
But wait by the CB
and I'll catch you later.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.917
I think we can totally make this
long-distance thing work...

08:23.417 --> 08:24.291
No!

08:24.375 --> 08:25.166
Hayley's supposed
to move on

08:25.208 --> 08:26.834
with Millionaire
Matt Davis!

08:28.083 --> 08:29.208
Dad, no!

08:34.542 --> 08:35.750
Damn it!

08:35.792 --> 08:37.250
Everything in Steve's
room is made of Nerf!

08:40.250 --> 08:41.291
It'll be like

08:41.333 --> 08:43.125
I'm looking in her eyes
when we talk.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.750
I also waterproofed it
for phone sex...

08:45.792 --> 08:47.458
so I can cry as
much as I want!

08:47.500 --> 08:48.709
Look, Jeff,

08:48.750 --> 08:50.792
I'm glad you reconnected
with your hippie wife,

08:50.834 --> 08:52.458
but you're getting
her hopes up, man.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.792
And we may never make it home.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.750
Oh, we'll get
home, Sinbad.

08:55.792 --> 08:56.959
And until we do,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.208
Hayley and I
are strong enough

08:58.250 --> 09:00.417
to survive a long-distance
relationship.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.291
You'll see.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.375
I believe you,
Jeff Fischer.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.875
You my man.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.375
Plus, it'll be cool for me
to know the first guy ever

09:05.417 --> 09:07.709
to make a long-distance
relationship work.

09:11.208 --> 09:14.166
Actually, babe, it's not
too bad up here in space,

09:14.208 --> 09:17.083
especially with
the world's funniest co-pilot.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.875
Oh, listen to what
Sinbad said yesterday:

09:19.917 --> 09:22.000
"Judo isn't an Olympic sport...

09:22.041 --> 09:23.917
it's what you make
matzo balls with!"

09:33.417 --> 09:34.583
Oh, Jeff.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.291
I wish I were
up there with you.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.542
Oh, you don't want
to be up here, babe.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.291
Sinbad's a blanket hog.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.583
You love it.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.417
You know
the tall guy

09:45.458 --> 09:46.959
and the Asian chick
from Rite Aid?

09:47.000 --> 09:47.875
Yeah.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.125
I saw them at
Pizza Hut together.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.208
Like on
a date?

09:50.250 --> 09:51.166
Yeah, it looked
like it.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.417
Wow.
Good for her.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.625
I know, right?

09:54.667 --> 09:57.166
Here comes
Millionaire Matt Davis.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.834
Poor schmuck, doesn't realize

09:58.875 --> 09:59.959
Hayley's still stuck on Jeff.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.667
Ugh, Hayley's
blowing it.

10:01.709 --> 10:02.834
All that money.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.792
Matt would have been
the perfect son-in-law.

10:04.834 --> 10:07.208
Maybe he still
can be...

10:09.083 --> 10:10.458
Hi, Matt!

10:10.500 --> 10:11.583
Hey, Mr. Smith.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.959
Um, sorry, I...

10:13.000 --> 10:14.792
I just want to make
sure Hayley's okay.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.959
She, um, hasn't been
returning my calls.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.166
Yeah, yeah, Hayley's fine.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.792
But have you met my younger,

10:19.834 --> 10:21.375
also-single daughter, Ramona?

10:21.417 --> 10:22.583
Hi.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.709
I'm Regina.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.500
Uh, I-I really just
want to see Hayley.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.667
Forget Hayley!

10:27.709 --> 10:29.542
Can she do this?

10:29.542 --> 10:31.750
Oh... I don't know.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.166
Or what about this?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.166
Hot!

10:35.208 --> 10:37.458
Probably not.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.166
Well, can Hayley do this?

10:40.208 --> 10:41.500
What about this?

10:43.250 --> 10:44.500
Think she can do this?

10:44.542 --> 10:45.834
Ha-duken!

10:47.333 --> 10:48.458
Or this?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.500
♪ ♪

10:53.250 --> 10:56.041
No way Hayley can do this.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.458
♪ ♪

10:59.500 --> 11:01.750
Look, it was nice
to meet you, Ramona,

11:01.792 --> 11:05.125
but Hayley's
the only girl for me.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.500
How about next time
you bring your "A" game?

11:09.208 --> 11:12.667
Stan! Reversing this
is a two-man job, Stan!

11:12.709 --> 11:13.875
Hey, no, stop!

11:13.917 --> 11:15.792
You're getting
my insides dirty!

11:16.625 --> 11:17.792
Stan!

11:19.834 --> 11:22.375
Jeff? Jeff, are you there?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.667
Oh, Hayley,
look at you,

11:27.709 --> 11:29.583
you're right back
where you started,

11:29.625 --> 11:30.709
trapped in your room.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.625
Yeah, but-but Jeff might
come back one day.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.667
Look, honey,
Jeff is gone.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.583
And nobody knows
where he is,

11:37.625 --> 11:38.792
not even him.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.959
Plus, he said he hated you
right before he left.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.208
No, he didn't.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.458
Okay, he didn't.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.667
But I just don't want
to see you waste your life

11:45.709 --> 11:47.875
waiting for a guy who's...

11:47.917 --> 11:49.750
never coming home.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.208
Exit on the joke,
Francine.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.417
Exit on the joke.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.291
Hey, babe!

11:56.333 --> 11:57.667
Hey, Jeff.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.917
So what'd you do today?

11:59.959 --> 12:01.709
Sat here... waiting.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.083
Yeah, I didn't do much either.

12:04.125 --> 12:07.291
Hey, Jeff, are, um,
are you guys any closer

12:07.333 --> 12:08.875
to figuring out a way home?

12:08.917 --> 12:10.750
Nope, not at all!

12:13.542 --> 12:16.750
But I did figure out a way
to make Sinbad laugh!

12:19.333 --> 12:20.917
That wasn't even real, girl!

12:20.959 --> 12:24.125
That was his hands!

12:28.625 --> 12:30.166
Matt, what the hell?!

12:30.208 --> 12:31.375
Sorry I'm late.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.792
Today I was a rodeo cowboy.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.000
And tonight I'm a chef!

12:38.583 --> 12:40.792
But first, let's thank
this noble animal

12:40.834 --> 12:41.792
for its sacrifice.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.959
Shine on, bull.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.291
Shine on.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.291
I was starting to worry
you didn't want to see me.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.583
So, when you called,
it was a big relief.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.667
Hup! Whup! Ho!

12:55.709 --> 12:57.667
Of course I wanted
to see you.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.500
It's just...
So sorry to interrupt,

12:59.542 --> 13:01.625
but you have something
behind your ear.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.667
What are these?

13:02.709 --> 13:03.625
Plane tickets.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.458
I planned an entire year
of adventure

13:05.500 --> 13:07.083
for us all over
the world...

13:07.125 --> 13:08.875
if you're interested.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.125
I'd love to go, Matt.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.250
There's just one thing
I have to do before I can.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.625
Oh, my God, Matt!

13:17.667 --> 13:19.542
I got this.

13:23.333 --> 13:27.291
Ah! My pre-owned Saturn!
I just got this thing!

13:35.250 --> 13:36.542
Jeff?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.166
Jeff, are-are you there?

13:38.208 --> 13:39.583
We need to talk.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.208
Hayley!
Oh, I'm glad you're there!

13:42.250 --> 13:44.959
Yeah, um, look, Jeff,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.792
let's be honest,

13:46.834 --> 13:48.709
you may never make it back,

13:48.750 --> 13:51.041
so I have to face reality.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.333
Babe, that's just it!

13:52.375 --> 13:54.041
We did find a way home!

13:54.083 --> 13:55.959
You-you found a way home?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.125
Yeah, our ship found
a wormhole

13:58.166 --> 13:59.667
that will take us
straight to Earth!

13:59.709 --> 14:04.166
So we can finally get back
to living our lives together?

14:04.208 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, babe,
I'll be home soon!

14:06.041 --> 14:07.542
Promise you'll wait
for me?

14:09.417 --> 14:11.208
Hayley, are you there?

14:11.792 --> 14:13.250
Yes, I-I'm here!

14:13.291 --> 14:15.500
I promise, Jeff,
I will wait for you.

14:20.834 --> 14:23.792
All right, Sinbad,
we're finally going home.

14:26.917 --> 14:28.792
Whoa, look at that!

14:28.834 --> 14:30.208
Wow...

14:30.250 --> 14:33.500
The wormhole,
it's so beautiful.

14:33.542 --> 14:36.500
Like staring
into the face of God!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.625
It's unbelievable!

14:42.333 --> 14:43.834
We... are...

14:43.875 --> 14:45.625
infinite!

14:47.750 --> 14:49.375
We made it!

14:55.125 --> 14:57.875
Hayley, it's me! Hayley!

14:59.917 --> 15:01.041
Hayley?

15:01.083 --> 15:03.875
Jeff! I knew you'd come.

15:03.917 --> 15:08.083
Oh! It's been 60 years,
but you're finally home!

15:08.125 --> 15:10.583
That would explain
the floating cars.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.542
I can't believe this.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.208
How did we end up
60 years in the future?

15:24.250 --> 15:25.583
When we went through
the wormhole,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.000
we must have traveled
through both space and time.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.959
There's a Magic Tree House book
that explains all of this.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.166
I waited for you
like I promised.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.959
I guess I just thought
that when you got here,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.250
we'd be the same age.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.083
Oh, that doesn't matter, babe.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.417
You're as beautiful now
as the day I met you.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.500
You mean it?
You know I do.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.792
Yeah, that's
real touching,

15:44.834 --> 15:47.083
but in the future, do you
folks still have food

15:47.125 --> 15:49.208
and do you offer it
to your guests?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.959
My family's gonna be
so excited to see you!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.667
And I can't wait
to see everyone!

15:55.709 --> 15:57.250
I also can't wait
to find out why

15:57.291 --> 15:59.166
everything in the
future hovers.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.792
I made my
famous Jell-O mold.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.583
Gah! Mrs. S.?

16:03.625 --> 16:04.959
You look so...

16:05.000 --> 16:05.917
Great, right?

16:05.959 --> 16:07.500
She's had
a little work done,

16:07.542 --> 16:08.875
but you can't
really tell.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.667
People often mistake
us for sisters.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.542
Ooh!

16:15.834 --> 16:18.000
Cool, you two
are still best friends?

16:18.041 --> 16:19.750
Actually,
we're a couple now.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.834
We made a pact that
we'd marry each other

16:21.875 --> 16:22.917
if we were
still single

16:22.959 --> 16:24.917
by the time
we turned 21.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.417
In retrospect,
we probably should have

16:26.458 --> 16:27.709
set the age
a little higher.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.792
We take turns
being the girl.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.125
No, no, we don't.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.291
Good for you guys.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.166
Hey! You made it back!

16:35.375 --> 16:37.083
Roger, you son of a bitch!

16:37.125 --> 16:38.458
You sent me into space!

16:38.500 --> 16:42.250
I know. I owe you a fairly
substantial apology, Jeff.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.834
But I'm a changed man.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.083
I've been involved with a lot
of shenanigans over the years,

16:46.125 --> 16:49.500
but the greatest adventure
of my life has been being a dad

16:49.542 --> 16:52.458
to these two amazing black sons,
who I adopted

16:52.500 --> 16:54.375
after their mother,
the love of my life,

16:54.417 --> 16:55.792
died in a car accident.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.041
We know he backed
over our mom,

16:58.083 --> 17:00.834
but he's been a real
good driver since then.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.625
Okay, you're
embarrassing me now.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.709
Dad, good
to see you.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.458
Still committing to
the ape body, I see.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.125
The ape uprising
is coming, Hayley,

17:12.166 --> 17:13.709
and I'll be ready
when it does.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.000
Mr. S., is that
really you?!

17:16.041 --> 17:17.166
Oh, I've missed you!

17:17.208 --> 17:18.458
You!

17:20.959 --> 17:23.166
Hayley was supposed to marry
Millionaire Matt Davis,

17:23.208 --> 17:26.750
and instead, she wasted
her entire life waiting for you!

17:26.834 --> 17:29.291
Dad, stop!
Leave him alone!

17:29.333 --> 17:30.834
Hayley, who's Matt Davis?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.083
You were gonna marry
someone else?

17:33.125 --> 17:36.333
Jeff, you don't understand!
You were gone!

17:36.375 --> 17:38.625
I-I didn't think you were
ever gonna come back!

17:41.333 --> 17:43.083
She's having
a heart attack!

17:43.125 --> 17:43.959
Give her space!

17:44.000 --> 17:45.667
Give her space
so she can die!

17:48.834 --> 17:53.083
Hayley, I'm so sorry
this happened.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.500
How's she doing?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.875
She's... comfortable.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.500
Wait-- you're
Millionaire Matt Davis?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.750
Yup. And I loved her.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.542
Till one day she told me
we were through.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.208
Ever since then I've just been

18:11.250 --> 18:13.875
mopping up vomit and guts
at this hospital,

18:13.917 --> 18:17.125
just trying to relive
the best day of my life--

18:17.166 --> 18:18.709
the day I met Hayley.

18:23.709 --> 18:26.542
Looks like I ruined
everyone's lives.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.750
I'm sorry I made you waste yours
waiting for me.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.000
Good-bye, babe...

18:32.041 --> 18:33.834
forever.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.458
Suck metal, Davis!

18:38.500 --> 18:40.375
Robot doctors rule!

18:45.834 --> 18:47.542
Come on, Sinbad,

18:47.583 --> 18:49.000
we don't belong here.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.458
Get back here!

18:56.500 --> 18:59.041
You wasted my daughter's life
and now you're running away?!

18:59.083 --> 19:01.667
Fischer!

19:13.291 --> 19:15.375
Yes! I knew it!

19:15.417 --> 19:17.041
The ape revolution is starting!

19:17.083 --> 19:18.709
Wait for me, brother apes!

19:23.125 --> 19:25.834
Greetings, brother apes!
I stand with you.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.834
Man, that was fun.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.917
So where we going now?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.625
Back through the wormhole.

19:39.667 --> 19:40.792
But if we do that,

19:40.834 --> 19:42.583
we're gonna be stranded
in deep space again.

19:42.625 --> 19:43.875
I know.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.583
Let me see
if we're back.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.583
Hayley?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.834
Hayley, are you there?!

19:54.875 --> 19:57.458
Yes, I'm here.
I promise, Jeff!

19:57.500 --> 19:59.417
I will wait for you.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.417
No, no, no, don't wait for me!

20:01.458 --> 20:05.208
Listen, babe, I thought we found
a way home, but I was wrong.

20:05.250 --> 20:08.000
And it's not fair to ask you
to wait for me.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.375
Jeff, what-what are you saying?

20:12.792 --> 20:14.625
Move on, babe.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.875
I release you.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.291
I'll never forget you,
Jeff Fischer.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.458
You gotta hide me!

20:24.500 --> 20:25.583
I just married
a black chick

20:25.625 --> 20:27.125
with two kids
and then I killed her!

20:27.166 --> 20:29.834
Okay, Hayley,
the jet is parked out front.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.250
You ready to go to Fiji?

20:31.291 --> 20:33.166
No witnesses!

20:34.875 --> 20:37.208
I guess today...

20:37.250 --> 20:39.083
I get to try out...

20:39.709 --> 20:41.375
being an angel.

20:47.458 --> 20:50.375
Well, looks like we both lost
a life partner today.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.208
You know
what'll make us feel better?

20:52.250 --> 20:53.959
A trip to Fiji.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.250
A mourncation.
