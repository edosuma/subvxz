- Yes.
- Let's go.

00:31.631 --> 00:32.803
- Let's go!
- Come on, Jane.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.371
Yes.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.946
Attagirl. Yes! Ha-ha.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.147
I did it. Finally, I won.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.978
No celebrating.
I beat you by a foot.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.246
No, no, no, Daddy.
You know that I won.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.016
Won, my ass.
I could have smoked a cigarette waiting.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.849
You know, you shouldn't lie.
It sets a bad example.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.016
Oh, you two.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.424
Chad, the apple does not
fall far from the tree.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.723
Chad, who won that race?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.628
This is strictly Hollander business.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.497
- Reenie, let me buy you a juice.
- Oh, such a gentleman.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.070
Yeah. Put it on Gordy's tab.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.228
All right.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.171
Well, they asked me
to audition for The Philadelphia Story.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.743
Mm! You should. As Tracy Lord?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.814
- We'll be in front to cheer you on.
- You don't cheer at a play.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.218
But it is all at night,
and then I wouldn't be home for Daddy...

01:14.374 --> 01:17.514
-...after his day at work.
- Wasn't your goal to retire at 50, Daddy?

01:17.677 --> 01:19.657
And that's, what, five years away?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.224
Yes, exactly.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.486
Now I have to wait until
your idiot brother...

01:23.650 --> 01:26.187
...can prove he won't
run the business into the ground.

01:26.352 --> 01:30.892
I will very likely be an old man unless
I can leave the business to you, Chad.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.030
Well, let's see.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.504
Been at Townley's a month.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.370
How early is too early to resign?

01:41.167 --> 01:43.306
- I'll take that from you, ma'am.
- Oh, I was--

01:43.470 --> 01:44.471
No, she's finished.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.173
Oh, okay.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.248
So finish that story.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.796
News of the Week, this is Charlie.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.164
I wonder why she's here.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.606
She's the publisher.
She doesn't need a reason.

03:19.766 --> 03:23.680
Oh, I read an article that despite being
one of the richest people in the country...

03:23.836 --> 03:27.682
...Mrs. Burkhart still enjoys
making her own clothes.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.151
I guarantee you she didn't make
those snakeskin shoes she walked in on.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.621
They look like they cost
at least $50.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.350
$50?

03:35.515 --> 03:38.325
The Burkhart family made their fortune
from Kentucky bourbon.

03:38.484 --> 03:42.364
As the story goes, a giant oak tree fell
on Bea's great great grandfather's house.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.264
He made 40 oak barrels
using that tree...

03:45.425 --> 03:47.632
...and used them for
his first batch of bourbon.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.467
It's now called
Storm Tree bourbon...

03:49.629 --> 03:52.439
...and it's one of the most
sought after in the world.

03:52.665 --> 03:53.700
Hm.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.912
The Burkhart family is a client
of my father's financial firm.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.014
- Oh.
- There it is.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.148
Oh, Naomi, you have a run
in your stockings.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.381
I have an extra pair
of L'eggs in my desk.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.219
Let me get them for you.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.860
Thank you.

04:13.052 --> 04:16.192
Heh, heh, heh.
I tell people when Daddy died...

04:16.356 --> 04:20.827
...he had so much bourbon in his blood,
they didn't have to embalm him.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.031
Thank you.

04:24.297 --> 04:27.073
Just a second and I will join you.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.504
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:28.668 --> 04:29.908
Bottoms up.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.083
Mm, wow!

04:36.442 --> 04:39.218
- That is good stuff, strong, strong stuff.
- Mm-hm.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.655
That'll drive you
to put a lampshade on your head.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.088
Well...

04:48.821 --> 04:51.062
...now that we have had
our frivolities...

04:51.224 --> 04:54.398
...let's get down to boring old business.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.435
Gentlemen, for most of my life...

05:00.600 --> 05:03.206
...although my father was
a rich bastard--

05:06.172 --> 05:09.016
I was a failure
at everything I ever did.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.381
I failed at arithmetic...

05:11.544 --> 05:14.150
...I failed at three marriages...

05:14.314 --> 05:17.193
...and I can't get a seed to flower
to save my life.

05:18.518 --> 05:22.796
But despite my failures,
people always remembered me.

05:22.955 --> 05:25.458
Because you were
the daughter of a rich bastard?

05:29.095 --> 05:30.972
Well, that helped.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.371
That has always helped, yes.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.571
Uh, but no.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.974
People remembered me
because I was different.

05:39.405 --> 05:43.649
I said things that
people didn't expect a lady to say...

05:43.810 --> 05:46.256
...I wore things that made
people turn their heads...

05:46.412 --> 05:49.791
...and I did things that, uh...

05:50.083 --> 05:52.654
...well, I usually blamed
on the bourbon.

05:54.187 --> 05:58.363
But I am concerned
that my daddy's magazine...

05:58.524 --> 06:00.902
...is not memorable.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.164
It's not interesting.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.702
There's nothing in our magazine
that I can't read somewhere else...

06:07.867 --> 06:09.847
...and to add insult to injury...

06:10.002 --> 06:12.448
<i>...Time</i> Magazine is kicking our butt.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.211
<i>- We're kicking Newsweek's butt.
- Look,</i> I <i>agree, Bea...</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:16.854
...but the news is the news.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.818
We're gonna be covering
the same story.

06:19.178 --> 06:23.183
Our goal is to tell it
better than anybody else.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.421
- To go deeper inside--
- We won't beat Time at their game.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.122
But the game is changing.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.097
And I can assure you,
we are looking to the future.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.800
And what is it that you see?

06:33.960 --> 06:38.136
Well, before long, Time is gonna be
the old people's magazine.

06:38.297 --> 06:42.006
Meanwhile, there are three million
23-year-old Americans out there.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.240
Their parents read Time Magazine,
which means they're not going to.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.012
They're looking for something different.
I want News of the Week to be that.

06:49.175 --> 06:52.679
So that by the time they're 25,
we're their go-to magazine.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.483
We're the voice that they trust.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.684
- That they can turn to.
- Hm.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.394
How are you going to do that?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.693
- We're working on several initiatives--
- How's he gonna do it, Wick?

07:05.558 --> 07:08.505
Well, we're gonna write about
the things they care about.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.935
Mm-hm.

07:10.329 --> 07:12.366
Civil rights. The draft.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.143
The back of the book stuff,
you know, the arts...

07:17.303 --> 07:18.714
...and rock musicians.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.147
Rolling Stone is less than two years old.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.651
It's got a fraction
of the subscribers Time does...

07:23.810 --> 07:26.450
...and yet the young people
can't stop talking about it.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.614
Jann Wanner,
he is not afraid to take risks.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.421
That is exactly what we need to do.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.495
You are saying that
we're going to lose readers?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.901
Well, you can't win
new readers without--

07:41.360 --> 07:42.896
We may lose some.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.680
Hm.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.044
Yeah, Tuesday.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.380
Robinson.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.823
Rhodes.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.899
You left this
in my apartment a while back.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.534
Thought you might want it.

08:10.690 --> 08:11.896
Need it.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.397
Are you trying to drive a point home?

08:14.560 --> 08:17.541
You will not be sleeping over
at my apartment anymore.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.077
I got it.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.878
We gonna be able to work together?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.108
Yes.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.648
Of course.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.201
Jane.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.231
Finn needs you.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.608
- Bea, you remember Jane.
- Of course.

08:57.770 --> 09:01.684
I knew Jane when she had
braces on her teeth...

09:01.841 --> 09:04.082
...and Gordy Hollander
had a full head of hair.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.086
It is so nice to see you,
Mrs. Burkhart.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.350
Jane was an
excellent recommendation of yours.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.994
She's kind of our head researcher
around here.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.329
Jane, maybe you can give Bea
a tour of the place before lunch.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.160
Well, that would be nice.
It's been a while.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.929
I'd love to revisit how
the sausages are made here.

09:20.226 --> 09:25.403
Well, I would love to show you
around the sausage factory. Heh. Um...

09:25.831 --> 09:27.833
- May I carry this for you?
Oh.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.212
Thank you.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.719
Bill Shawn from New Yorker called
to say he only found two typos...

09:44.884 --> 09:46.420
...in last week's issue.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.894
Son of a bitch.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.897
Inside joke.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.736
- Angie.
- Yes?

09:55.561 --> 09:56.801
Is that a hand?

10:05.037 --> 10:06.038
Yes.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.240
Yes, it is.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.815
It's my daughter.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.951
She woke up too sick
to go to school...

10:12.111 --> 10:14.819
...and my husband's on a
construction site for three weeks.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.991
My neighbor who
watches her in a pinch...

10:17.149 --> 10:20.153
...is at the hospital
having a baby of her own.

10:20.319 --> 10:23.357
I understand how terrible the timing is
with Mrs. Burkhart here--

10:23.522 --> 10:26.002
Angie, I didn't know
you had a daughter.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.342
Hi. What's your name?

10:38.537 --> 10:40.073
Vera.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.551
I hope you feel better soon.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.461
Put her in my office, she can lay down.
Comfy couch.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.689
- What about--
- It's better, it's private.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.458

11:19.812 --> 11:21.382
How old are you?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.383
Twenty-four.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.128
Oh.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.988
Follow me.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.031
Do you read this magazine?

11:38.497 --> 11:39.669
Is that a trick question?

11:40.566 --> 11:43.103
No, it's a goddamn serious question.
Do you read it?

11:43.269 --> 11:44.577
Every word.

11:44.737 --> 11:48.446
How about the average 24-year-old?
If you didn't work here, would you read it?

11:48.607 --> 11:51.986
Well, I would, but I'm weird.
I read three newspapers every morning...

11:52.144 --> 11:54.021
...even before I got this job.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.761
Well, I guess we're both weird.
Three?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.760
I will require absolute silence.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.757
The Times. The <i>Daily News.</i>

12:02.922 --> 12:07.166
<i>You're too smart to read the Post.
Too cool to read the Wall Street Journal.</i>

12:08.294 --> 12:09.796
What am I missing?

12:10.696 --> 12:12.801
The Star Ledger. Ha.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.536
- It's what I grew up on.
- The loyal reader.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.810
That's fucking beautiful.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.946
And that's why we
gotta get them young.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.142
Keep them loyal.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.483
Can I tell you a secret?

12:27.179 --> 12:30.820
There's not a man in the history
of the world that said no to that question.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.821
All right, Robinson.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.693
I'm ready to receive
your covert intelligence.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.998
I watch the late local.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.333
You are weird.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.236
I bet that requires a stiff drink.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.898
A joint, actually.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.901
You watch the TV news
high on marijuana.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.479
Not out of my mind.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.707
Just, you know, tuned in.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.579
Why?

12:55.074 --> 12:59.454
I don't want to just
watch the news.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.089
I want to feel a part of it.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.524
Doesn't working here
make you feel a part of it?

13:06.318 --> 13:07.922
Sometimes.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.979
Oh, the noisy telex room.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.215
It's like a factory.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.917
- I love the sound of breaking news.
- Heh, heh.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.892
Daddy said he used
to hear it in his sleep.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.856
A lot of us do.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.059
Mrs. Burkhart,
this is Cindy Reston...

13:45.224 --> 13:46.430
...one of our researchers.

13:46.592 --> 13:49.198
Well, I didn't think
it was the milk maid.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.939
That is a beautiful vest, Cindy.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.538
Thank you.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.976
I actually made it myself.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.744
- Hi.
- Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.785
Um... Jane, have you seen Brady?

14:03.943 --> 14:06.617
I'm supposed to be helping him today
because Susan is out.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.225
No, no, I haven't.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.329
Nice to meet you.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.171
So, Jane, tell me...

14:24.396 --> 14:26.672
...how is everything?
Everybody treating you well?

14:26.832 --> 14:28.505
Absolutely. Very well.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.305
- I love my job.
- Good.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.039
Glad to hear it.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.775
Though I was surprised to learn
you were still here.

14:34.940 --> 14:38.183
I thought a pretty girl like you
would be married by now.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.620
Well, my boyfriend
just graduated from Wharton...

14:40.779 --> 14:42.918
...and started his job
at Townley Investments.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.956
Is it anybody I know?

14:45.117 --> 14:46.619
Chad Huntington.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.130
- His father--
- So, of course, Huntington Metal, yes.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.533
But you were dating Chad
before you started working here, yes?

14:54.693 --> 14:57.299
- It's been almost two years.
- Two years.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.437
And you don't have a ring
on that finger yet.

15:00.599 --> 15:01.771
Goodness.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.210
He couldn't do better.
What is he waiting for?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.308
Well, there's the new job and all.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.508
Yeah.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.218
Oh! There it is. Heh, heh.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.647
Shall we?

15:14.813 --> 15:16.554
Let's continue.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.524
Did you see what just came in?

15:20.686 --> 15:22.495
Their official statement with numbers.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.726
The FBI defends police action
in Los Angeles.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.870
They say it's
the eighth act of violence...

15:27.026 --> 15:28.562
...perpetrated by Black Panthers.

15:28.727 --> 15:29.899
Just read the same thing.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.201
But I called the
Los Angeles Police precinct...

15:32.364 --> 15:34.640
...and they only have
three on their blotter.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.780
The FBI lied, or L.A. intake stinks.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.007
Check out Chicago.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.249
That's where Fred Hampton
was killed. One.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.785
FBI crime stats say five,
Chicago says two.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.547
It's orchestrated sabotage.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.422
If the trend continues.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.992
You call precincts
west of the Mississippi, I'll do the east.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.256
We'll see what kind of numbers
we get.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.088
Hey.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.867
Good work. Thanks.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.531
Oh!

16:03.696 --> 16:05.471
- Hey. Sorry. Hi.
- Sorry.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.611
- What's up?
<i>_Um__</i>

16:08.167 --> 16:11.580
Well, I was supposed to help Brady
with his environmental policy story...

16:11.737 --> 16:13.944
...and I couldn't find him...

16:14.106 --> 16:17.019
...and I found this in his typewriter.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.177
What's that say?

16:19.345 --> 16:21.689
-"I can't write this story."
- Whoa!

16:21.847 --> 16:23.326
Brady always seemed so relaxed.

16:23.482 --> 16:27.055
Yeah, well, I guess
this place really isn't for everybody.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.927
But Wick wants the story
on the wall today...

16:30.089 --> 16:33.161
...so they know how much space
they have for the rest of the page.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.970
So do you think maybe
Doug could write it?

16:36.128 --> 16:38.199
He and I are in the middle
of something.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.139
I think Jane said
that Sam was doing--

16:40.299 --> 16:41.403
Why don't you write it?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.815
And get fired like Nora?

16:44.970 --> 16:46.574
Nora re-wrote her reporter.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.480
Yours left the magazine high and dry.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.211
If Wick has a problem,
tell him what the lawyer told us:

16:51.377 --> 16:54.449
- That it's illegal not to let us write.
- You girls seen Brady?

16:54.613 --> 16:55.956
- He quit.
- He's gone.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.618
Ugh! Fucker took my Zippo.

16:58.784 --> 16:59.785
Sorry.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.763
You look cute today.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.670
Sacramento Police.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.038
This is Patti Robinson.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.477
I'm from News of the Week magazine.
Can I speak to the chief of police?

17:18.637 --> 17:21.777
- Can I put you on hold?
- Yes, I'll hold. Thank you.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.618
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

17:32.785 --> 17:35.322
Yes, sir, I have
everything I need.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.468
I really appreciate your time.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.098
Sir, I would advise you
to find some experienced legal counsel...

18:18.263 --> 18:20.937
...who understands the libel laws of the
United States...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.704
...because if you are so f--

18:23.769 --> 18:25.578
Misinformed about
what that means--

18:30.843 --> 18:33.847
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.883
Is that right?

18:37.282 --> 18:39.489
No, that is not what I said.

18:43.889 --> 18:47.200
Because I was standing with myself
10 seconds ago when I said it...

18:47.359 --> 18:49.703
...and my ears work as well as my brain.
Excuse me.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.035
Something pressing has come
to my attention.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.373
Let me see if I can pull yours off.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.920
He's off the phone.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.188
- You ready?
- Finn, Doug and Patti wanted a word.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.623
- Come on, Vera.
- Just one more.

19:10.782 --> 19:11.886
There'll be more soon.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.121
Remember, in a newsroom,
you gotta look busy.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.197
- Give me your busy face.
- I said let's go.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.699
You should get to the luncheon.
Your car's waiting.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.461
Yeah. Fill me in.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.506
Well, we're not done, but so far
we've called 21 capital city precincts.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.075
18 of them couldn't confirm
the violent incidents...

19:27.232 --> 19:29.439
...the FBI is attributing to
the Black Panthers.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.706
- Why couldn't they?
- Their numbers were lower.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.645
So the Panthers are responsible for--

19:33.805 --> 19:36.251
Some incidents,
but nothing like the FBl's reporting.

19:36.408 --> 19:40.015
The FBI is using their numbers to justify
a massive ramp-up in surveillance...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.852
...against the Black Panthers.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.756
If you're accusing the FBI
of framing citizens...

19:44.917 --> 19:46.760
...you'd better have sources for miles.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.557
- That would be nice.
- Wouldn't it?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.923
Let's talk over lunch.
You can share my car.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.284
Come in.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.388
Um...

20:18.584 --> 20:19.585
Hello.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.256
What do you need?

20:23.488 --> 20:24.728
Oh...

20:24.890 --> 20:26.062
Well, I mean, I--

20:26.225 --> 20:30.935
I know that you wanted Brady's
environmental story on the wall today.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.703
So I have it.

20:37.869 --> 20:39.109
What's he doing?

20:39.671 --> 20:41.878
Why didn't he bring it himself?

20:42.107 --> 20:45.714
Oh, well,
he seems to have quit.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.687
He cleaned out his desk
and he left a note...

20:48.847 --> 20:51.953
...that made it seem like
he was not coming back.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.528
Jeez.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.221
I should have known.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.231
It's guys that act like nothing fazes them
you gotta watch.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.163
All the men were busy...

21:03.495 --> 21:08.672
...so I just wrote it myself
off the research.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.404
Pretty straightforward.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.876
I guess maybe Brady
preferred the stories...

21:14.039 --> 21:16.280
...with more conflict or--

21:16.441 --> 21:19.388
Okay, take this to the copy desk...

21:19.678 --> 21:22.682
...make those couple of changes
and put it up on the wall.

21:28.987 --> 21:32.799
Girls, just some
early Christmas presents...

21:32.958 --> 21:37.737
...for the most beautiful
and important part of this magazine.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.038
Here you go, sweetie.

21:40.666 --> 21:41.906
- And for you.
- Thank you.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.341
This is Naomi.

21:43.502 --> 21:44.503
Hi.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.705
- This is Patti.
- Hi.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.441
- And this is Vivian.
- Oh.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.517
- Oh.
- Merry Christmas, ladies.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.677
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you so much.

21:51.843 --> 21:54.722
You think I don't know
what you do for those boys up there.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.016
Fran.

21:58.884 --> 21:59.885
Is that--

22:00.752 --> 22:02.231
Look at you.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.368
Wedged back there like a doorstop.

22:05.524 --> 22:06.525
Hello, dear.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.036
Come out here
and give me a hug.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.003
Oh, sweetie.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.667
- You look just beautiful.
- Oh.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.805
Fran and I are old friends.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.950
The summer when I was 15,
do you remember?

22:21.106 --> 22:27.284
I came to visit Daddy every day.
Fran would give me a stick of green gum.

22:27.446 --> 22:31.087
And a piece of paper, and sit me down
at her typewriter...

22:31.249 --> 22:34.389
...and, oh, I wrote some
bad poetry that summer.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.321
It's because of Fran.

22:37.889 --> 22:41.666
Oh, sweetie, I can't believe
you've been here almost 30 years.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.431
Last Friday was 40.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.268
Good heavens, 40 years.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.841
In the pit?

22:46.998 --> 22:49.911
This was my very first job
out of high school.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.706
And it'll be her last.

22:51.870 --> 22:55.613
- We are lucky to have her.
- Oh.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.621
And we are lucky to have all of you.

23:02.013 --> 23:06.758
You know, my daddy always wanted
everybody who worked for us...

23:06.918 --> 23:09.421
...to feel like family, didn't he?

23:09.988 --> 23:11.467
I know I'm not around often...

23:11.623 --> 23:15.002
...but I want you to know
that you can always come to me...

23:15.160 --> 23:18.004
...with any questions or concerns.

23:19.431 --> 23:22.105
I'm crying. So glad to see you.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.678
<i>- I'll</i> see you soon.
- All right.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.178
Merry Christmas, everybody.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.248
Merry Christmas.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.009
Merry Christmas.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.490
I want you to go to Tiffany's on Fifth...

23:38.650 --> 23:41.290
...and get Fran a crystal paperweight
for her desk.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.932
Put it on my account.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.762
Poor thing, 40 years
deserves more than a scarf.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.801
Of course. That is so thoughtful of you.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.165
Mrs. Burkhart.

23:49.327 --> 23:52.331
I do have a question, actually.

23:52.497 --> 23:55.603
Some of us were wondering if,
because we work so hard on stories...

23:55.767 --> 23:58.213
...we might be included
in the writers' luncheons?

23:58.970 --> 24:01.143
Oh! No, honey.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.244
No. Trust me.

24:03.408 --> 24:05.183
You would sooner be
stuck in the eye...

24:05.343 --> 24:07.914
...with a sharp stick,
those things are so boring.

24:08.079 --> 24:10.650
It would give us a chance
to talk about the magazine--

24:10.816 --> 24:14.263
So much more fun down here
gossiping with your girlfriends.

24:15.921 --> 24:17.559
Thank you.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.077
Thank you.

25:12.911 --> 25:14.515
- Did you see the lines?
- Thank you.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.920
I am trying to manage expectations...

25:17.082 --> 25:19.961
...so you don't look like a failure next year
when we're down.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.120
You're managing me right
into a snake pit.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.563
- Oh, let's--
- I would appreciate it--

25:24.756 --> 25:26.099
Oh!

25:26.291 --> 25:28.430
Thank you.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.937
Well, I am sure
there is some rule...

25:31.096 --> 25:35.511
...about chasing bourbon with a martini,
but you boys won't tell, will you, now?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.442
The soul of discretion, Bea.

25:38.670 --> 25:39.978
You know, in the old days...

25:40.138 --> 25:42.675
...when your father declined
a martini at lunch...

25:42.841 --> 25:45.515
...we knew somebody
was getting fired.

25:49.915 --> 25:53.624
To the fine journalists
of News of the <i>Week.</i>

25:53.785 --> 25:56.026
May all the stories you print...

25:56.187 --> 25:58.360
...be just as interesting
as those you tell.

25:59.524 --> 26:01.504
And a good deal more truthful.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.695
I'll drink to that.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.569
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear, hear.

26:07.699 --> 26:11.875
Finn, I think there's a real story in this
thing with the Black Panthers and FBI.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.517
Don't confuse incompetence
with iniquity.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.175
You think the FBI can't count?

26:16.341 --> 26:18.116
I think Hoover
does things his own way.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.187
If he wants to put
berets on house cats...

26:20.345 --> 26:21.824
...and call them panthers,
who's to stop him?

26:21.980 --> 26:24.654
That's exactly the point, though.
Who is gonna stop him?

26:25.383 --> 26:26.987
Bea, we're doing very well...

26:27.652 --> 26:30.599
...in every category
across the board.

26:30.922 --> 26:34.028
It's true. The moon landing sold best
off the newsstand...

26:34.192 --> 26:36.638
...but the top selling cover...

26:36.795 --> 26:39.332
...not directly related
to that week's news...

26:39.497 --> 26:40.498
...was Janis Joplin.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.804
Well, you can't only
look at the newsstand.

26:42.968 --> 26:46.916
Our main obligation
is our subscribers.

26:47.072 --> 26:50.576
And they damn sure
would rather see Sinatra on the cover.

26:50.742 --> 26:54.349
Our subscribers have already paid
for the privilege...

26:54.512 --> 26:57.652
...of enjoying the brilliance
you put inside that cover.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.592
It's the new readers
you win at the newsstand.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.166
What sold best for <i>Time?</i>

27:06.057 --> 27:07.934
I just-- I need more access.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.637
I need to check.

27:11.663 --> 27:14.109
You ought to know.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.729
Sorry to make you wait.

27:33.885 --> 27:36.593
There's only one ladies' room
in the whole damn building...

27:36.755 --> 27:39.759
...and it's-- Uh!-- all the way downstairs.

27:39.924 --> 27:43.371
You know pregnant women are supposed
to gain weight during pregnancy?

27:43.528 --> 27:45.030
Well, not me, no.

27:45.196 --> 27:48.006
I am gaining it in my stomach
but losing it in my ass...

27:48.166 --> 27:50.874
"because I have to climb those stairs
10 times a day.

27:52.871 --> 27:55.351
- When is your baby due?
- You see this?

27:57.142 --> 28:00.055
Yes. We brought you a copy,
but I see you already have one.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.487
I know you work there,
but do you ever read it?

28:02.914 --> 28:03.949
Oh, of course.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.116
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

28:05.283 --> 28:07.786
Okay, do you read this page?

28:08.186 --> 28:09.324
Yes.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.192
Senior editors.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.098
All men.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.600
General editors. All men.

28:17.962 --> 28:22.240
Department heads,
Jonathan, Mark, Wilbur.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.504
All men.

28:23.668 --> 28:28.083
Reporters,
Douglas, Marshall, Samuel.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.083
More men.

28:31.609 --> 28:36.115
So you're never gonna get
your name on this page.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.794
You good with that?

28:52.630 --> 28:53.665
Oh!

28:53.832 --> 28:56.176
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.

28:56.334 --> 28:57.972
I'm sorry.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.153
Thank you, dear.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.289
Thank you.

29:17.555 --> 29:19.501
Mid-town, please.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.975
Here's the process.

29:26.131 --> 29:29.305
First, we file a complaint
with the EEOC.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.468
And that is--

29:30.635 --> 29:33.013
Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.741
It's a formal way of saying...

29:35.240 --> 29:38.312
...it's not fair that guys get to do
all the cool stuff.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.155
So we're suing them?

29:41.880 --> 29:45.828
No, not yet.
First, we scare the hell out of them...

29:46.184 --> 29:50.496
...which will get them to do the right thing
without seeing the inside of a courtroom.

29:50.655 --> 29:54.102
What if they don't do anything?

29:56.060 --> 29:57.698
Then we sue.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.843
And that's fine, too.
It just takes longer.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.946
Homosexuals in Hollywood.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.851
- Well, Newsweek ran a--
- Or jogging.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.122
Jogging. Young people are running...

30:16.281 --> 30:18.192
...with no particular
destination in mind.

30:18.349 --> 30:20.920
- Who covers health?
- JP here is on the health beat...

30:21.085 --> 30:22.621
...but he still eats like shit.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.965
I mean, I know some of these
may be trendy...

30:26.124 --> 30:28.798
...but you never know
what begets what.

30:29.227 --> 30:32.037
Upton Sinclair
took a bite of a burger...

30:32.197 --> 30:33.437
<i>...wrote The Jungle.</i>

30:34.566 --> 30:36.102
Please excuse me for a minute.

30:36.267 --> 30:40.909
My martini glass runneth over,
so to speak. Ahem.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.551
Excuse me.

30:49.447 --> 30:52.223
You want to tell me
why you're really here, Bea?

30:53.218 --> 30:56.597
You don't believe I'm here to play Santa
and buy you drinks?

30:56.754 --> 30:57.755
No, ma'am.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.433
You got good instincts.

31:01.826 --> 31:05.672
I'm here because
our end of year numbers are crap.

31:06.264 --> 31:11.338
I respect your vision,
but I can't wait two years to see change.

31:11.502 --> 31:13.778
I need to see it in six months.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.947
- That's difficult.
- Don't you tell me your job is hard...

31:19.110 --> 31:22.148
...because I am not
in the business of easy.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.022
Mm-hm.
- Ahem.

31:29.187 --> 31:30.962
Anybody here
wear contact lenses?

31:31.122 --> 31:33.102
Apparently you put them
right on your eyes.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.950
So I just came by to do that.

31:54.412 --> 31:58.326
Well, it'll give me something to think
about until I pick you up for dinner.

31:58.483 --> 32:02.397
Actually, I have one more thing
for you to think about.

32:03.955 --> 32:08.028
We've been dating
for over two years...

32:08.192 --> 32:10.934
...and on one hand, that seems like
a very short time.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.975
You were in school and sometimes
I work around the clock.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.306
And it's only been
two Christmases...

32:17.468 --> 32:20.244
...one of which we couldn't even
spend together.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.582
And it seems like
every time I see you...

32:22.740 --> 32:24.481
...I learn something new...

32:24.642 --> 32:27.919
...like how you got
that scar on your knee.

32:28.179 --> 32:30.523
Or why your mother
calls you Beanie.

32:34.419 --> 32:38.890
But on the other hand,
it is a very long time...

32:39.057 --> 32:43.369
...to be at this stage
of a relationship...

32:43.528 --> 32:46.304
...once we've professed
our love for each other.

32:47.899 --> 32:50.505
And I do love you, Chad...

32:51.336 --> 32:53.907
...which is why I'm ready
for the next stage.

32:55.073 --> 32:58.213
But if you're not ready for that,
I need to know.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.053
So three months.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.959
I need to know in three months.

33:07.118 --> 33:10.930
Because that would still give me a year
to plan for a spring wedding.

33:11.522 --> 33:13.524
If that's what
I should be planning for.

33:16.194 --> 33:19.073
Otherwise, I should be considering
my other options.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.410
You're giving me an ultimatum?

33:24.702 --> 33:26.113
No.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.054
I'm giving you a chance
to know me better.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.991
And now you know how I feel.

33:42.453 --> 33:43.989
<i>Okay-</i>

33:45.823 --> 33:47.097
Three months.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.438
Got it.

33:59.003 --> 34:02.314
Oh, I'll have one more, please.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.916
If I drank two of those, you would have
to carry me back to work.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.960
- She just made me so nervous.
- I know.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.893
You know, talking about
how we have to recruit more women...

34:16.054 --> 34:18.659
...for the complaint
to mean anything.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.393
She said we need a majority.

34:20.558 --> 34:23.232
That's 18 girls.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.873
We should talk to Vivian first.

34:25.029 --> 34:28.010
She's always complaining about
how Hank takes her research...

34:28.166 --> 34:32.239
...and just drops them in articles without
changing anything or saying thank you.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.282
I mean, what about that?
What about a thank you now and then?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.216
- Patti--
- Maybe Beverly, too.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.350
I don't know, Patti.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.382
You don't know what?

34:45.817 --> 34:47.763
If I can do this.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.025
Oh, Cindy, I am nervous, too...

34:51.188 --> 34:53.260
...but if we don't do this...

34:53.424 --> 34:56.530
...we're gonna end up
in the pit for 40 years like Fran.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.141
Hey.

35:01.933 --> 35:02.968
What is it?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.043
I am...

35:06.504 --> 35:08.643
...so lonely...

35:09.674 --> 35:11.153
...in my marriage.

35:13.344 --> 35:16.257
When it's time to leave work...

35:16.414 --> 35:19.793
...I get this
heavy feeling in my chest...

35:19.951 --> 35:23.398
...and my heart starts to race.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.192
And when I walk through the door...

35:26.357 --> 35:28.894
...I try to smile extra big.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.603
You know, like if...

35:31.963 --> 35:35.035
...I act happy,
then maybe I'll start to feel it.

35:36.501 --> 35:40.176
And he really wants to start a family.

35:40.338 --> 35:46.289
And when we got married
I thought that I did, too, but now I...

35:47.245 --> 35:50.624
...can't imagine bringing a baby
into our home.

35:52.750 --> 35:57.460
In the mornings,
I cannot wait to get out the door.

35:57.622 --> 36:01.229
I love riding the train to work...

36:02.059 --> 36:06.235
...and the doughnut guy
who tells me I'm beautiful every day.

36:06.397 --> 36:08.377
Wait, the one on the corner
of 23rd Street?

36:08.533 --> 36:09.841
Yes.

36:10.701 --> 36:11.975
Oh.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.872
I guess--

36:14.038 --> 36:16.917
I guess he tells you
that you're beautiful, too.

36:17.074 --> 36:20.385
No. No, he tells me
to slow down.

36:23.948 --> 36:26.428
I love coming to work.

36:27.084 --> 36:31.658
I love being at work. It's fun.

36:32.256 --> 36:34.258
You know, the guys, the girls...

36:34.425 --> 36:37.804
...the sound of the telex machine.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.137
The smell of the mimeograph.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.174
But...

36:43.601 --> 36:46.480
...you heard what she said.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.508
If the guys find out
what we're up to...

36:49.674 --> 36:55.181
...or if any of the girls rat us out,
we could get fired.

36:55.980 --> 37:01.191
It's not worth the risk to me.

37:01.552 --> 37:07.468
I mean, even if I am being
treated unfairly at work, it's...

37:10.795 --> 37:13.935
It's still the best thing that I have.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.946
I can't do this without you.

37:35.519 --> 37:37.658
It's from Mrs. Burkhart.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.159
For me?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.802
Oh, my goodness.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.071
I have dreamed
of getting a present...

37:45.229 --> 37:48.233
...in one of these blue boxes
since I can remember.

37:53.304 --> 37:54.942
Oh!

37:56.340 --> 37:59.651
Isn't that beautiful?

38:00.478 --> 38:03.357
That is really something.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.152
I agree.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.159
Someone could find
themselves staring...

38:07.318 --> 38:10.822
...at something that beautiful
for a very long time.

38:11.789 --> 38:16.670
Well, you're welcome to come by
and admire it any time, Jane.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.500
How'd it go?

38:47.658 --> 38:49.296
Finn's into it.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.406
He said go, 90, 9°-

38:51.562 --> 38:53.473
Or maybe he said ho, ho, ho.

38:53.631 --> 38:54.632
It's hard to say.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.144
Bea ordered so many drinks,
I developed a ringing in my ears.

38:58.302 --> 39:02.512
Oh, well, maybe I should
wait a moment before giving you this.

39:03.774 --> 39:04.946
Is that three things?

39:05.910 --> 39:09.448
That is one address
for the Black Panther headquarters.

39:09.613 --> 39:11.889
I got them to agree to talk to you
this afternoon.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.255
How did you do that?

39:13.417 --> 39:15.693
I told them our editors
didn't want you to talk...

39:15.853 --> 39:19.733
...because they feel that their interviews
are shrill and predictable...

39:19.890 --> 39:23.463
...but we want to focus exclusively
on their social programs...

39:23.627 --> 39:25.129
...which nobody is covering.

39:25.296 --> 39:28.243
It'll take two questions
of that before launching into politics.

39:28.399 --> 39:30.310
Yeah, it is, so we should get going.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.948
- We?
- Well, I want to come with you.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.242
- No.
- Please.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.406
No way.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.348
I'm just gonna listen
and take notes...

39:37.508 --> 39:39.010
...and help you stand up.

39:39.176 --> 39:40.280
I said no.

39:40.444 --> 39:41.445
Why?

39:41.879 --> 39:44.359
Because, Patti, it's Harlem...

39:44.515 --> 39:45.789
...and it's dangerous.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.521
I just need to worry about
the story and about myself...

39:48.686 --> 39:50.597
...without having
to worry about you, too.

39:54.525 --> 39:55.970
Okay. Yeah, thanks.

40:01.799 --> 40:05.474
Wow. Okay, Vera,
no matter what happens...

40:05.636 --> 40:07.843
<i>...you're gonna be the winner, okay'?
Nay!</i>

40:09.206 --> 40:10.810
Cindy, you're gonna
come in second.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.215
- Oh, thank you.
- Here.

40:12.376 --> 40:13.787
Ooh. All right.

40:14.645 --> 40:17.251
Oh, God, ha, ha, ha.

40:17.715 --> 40:20.161
- I'm not very good.
- Can I have the yellow one?

40:20.785 --> 40:21.786
Here you go. Here.

40:21.952 --> 40:22.953
Oh. I did it.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.724
- That's how you do it.
- I did it.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.664
Oh, my gosh.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.706
I'm Doug Rhodes
from News of the <i>Week.</i>

41:10.501 --> 41:12.344
I'm here to see Keith.

41:23.347 --> 41:27.887
You know, mere inches from the finish
line that damn horse dropped dead.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.692
Ha, ha! And the little jockey
popped up off of him...

41:30.855 --> 41:34.462
- ...like a piece of popcorn into the air--
- Oh, God.

41:36.727 --> 41:38.468
- Ugh.
You are getting worse, actually.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.973
I don't know why, just-- I'm digressing.
I don't know.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.436
- Yeah, and you're--
- I can't talk.

41:45.603 --> 41:47.310
- Oh! Uh-oh! I'll get it.
- Oh. Uh-oh.

41:48.138 --> 41:49.617
Oh.

42:00.584 --> 42:01.585
This is yours.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.367
Do you know that my daddy
never let me come to the office...

42:08.526 --> 42:10.563
...until I was 13 years old?

42:15.366 --> 42:17.573
Because this is
no place for a child.

42:17.735 --> 42:19.237
Yeah, that's my fault, Bea.

42:19.403 --> 42:21.474
I know she's young,
but she's the only one...

42:21.639 --> 42:25.086
...with hands tiny enough to change out
the ink in those telex machines.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.618
Oh, you.

42:30.114 --> 42:31.525
Come on, I'll show you out.

42:31.682 --> 42:35.220
Thank you, everybody,
for your hospitality...

42:35.386 --> 42:36.524
...and your service.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.630
Bye bye, now.

42:43.127 --> 42:46.131
Breakfast for children
was always on the agenda.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.299
Huey P. Newton
himself said that on day one...

42:48.465 --> 42:51.036
...the Black Panther Party
was dedicated to a revolution...

42:51.201 --> 42:53.477
...but that revolution
is defined by our goals...

42:53.637 --> 42:55.514
...not our methods.

42:55.673 --> 42:58.984
See, we must feed
and educate the people.

42:59.143 --> 43:00.520
Because this...

43:00.678 --> 43:02.180
...this is about the people.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.223
Not the party.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.658
Power to the people.

43:09.653 --> 43:11.758
You dig, Sundance?

43:11.989 --> 43:13.332
What about your free clinics?

43:13.490 --> 43:15.470
This community needs
separate medical care?

43:15.626 --> 43:17.037
Yes.

43:17.194 --> 43:18.935
We need healing.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.499
From what?

43:21.899 --> 43:24.539
From a world in which we are
systematically brutalized...

43:24.702 --> 43:26.579
...by racist white police
who oppress us.

43:40.384 --> 43:42.523
Where'd you go to college, Jane?

43:42.686 --> 43:43.687
Bryn Mawr.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.465
Did you work for the newspaper there?

43:47.024 --> 43:48.230
I was the editor.

43:49.226 --> 43:53.868
Okay, so do you ever feel like you want
something more from working here...

43:54.031 --> 43:55.942
...like to be able to grow?

43:56.467 --> 43:59.141
Well, I don't plan on
being here much longer.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.249
I have a boyfriend.

44:01.405 --> 44:03.043
Oh!

44:03.307 --> 44:04.877
You've never mentioned him.

44:05.609 --> 44:08.021
Church and state, keep it separate.

44:08.812 --> 44:13.283
Even so, Jane,
you're so good at your job.

44:15.886 --> 44:18.833
I'm not a career girl, Patti.

44:35.706 --> 44:37.379
<i>Okay-</i>

44:53.257 --> 44:55.828
We're tormented by
a corrupt capitalist system.

44:55.993 --> 44:58.803
A system which was denied its
endless source of free labor...

44:58.962 --> 45:00.964
...now intent on denying us our dignity.

45:01.131 --> 45:02.769
- And if--
- Not to cut you off...

45:02.933 --> 45:06.176
-...but are you saying the Black Panther--
- There's the white apology.

45:06.470 --> 45:07.471
The what?

45:07.638 --> 45:08.810
The white apology.

45:09.273 --> 45:10.308
The lie.

45:11.742 --> 45:13.983
Man, you so deep into it,
you can't even see.

45:15.145 --> 45:17.182
You said you're sorry
for cutting me off...

45:17.347 --> 45:20.123
...while in the very process
of cutting me off.

45:22.086 --> 45:23.190
Yes, I did.

45:23.787 --> 45:26.563
So what is it
you're really sorry about? Hm?

45:27.257 --> 45:29.931
Maybe that you came in
like the other white journalists...

45:30.094 --> 45:31.971
...already dead sure what you'll write.

45:32.129 --> 45:33.699
That's not true. I want to know.

45:34.631 --> 45:37.305
You came here to ask about breakfast
for poor black kids.

45:41.638 --> 45:43.311
So ask it.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.986
Ask me what you really
came to ask me.

45:47.511 --> 45:50.117
I believe the FBI might be inflating
acts of violence...

45:50.280 --> 45:52.191
...committed by
the Black Panther Party...

45:52.349 --> 45:54.488
...to justify an increase in surveillance.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.491
That's what you believe, Sundance?

46:00.791 --> 46:01.826
Good for you.

46:01.992 --> 46:04.063
That's what I know.

46:04.228 --> 46:06.799
We ain't scary enough.
They gotta make us into monsters.

46:06.964 --> 46:09.342
Your party hasn't shied
from advocating violence.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.571
Some might feel the FBI is justified--

46:11.735 --> 46:13.510
Advocating violence?

46:14.438 --> 46:17.419
I was born in chains.
Because of the color of my skin.

46:17.574 --> 46:20.248
My grandmother, my mother,
my grandfather and my father...

46:20.410 --> 46:22.185
...all born in chains.

46:22.346 --> 46:24.724
Now, Dr. King asked y'all nicely
to cut them off.

46:24.882 --> 46:26.122
Y'all wouldn't listen.

46:26.283 --> 46:27.284
Y'all killed him.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.556
Now you gotta deal with us.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.666
Now we carry guns.

46:32.923 --> 46:35.369
We're trying to feed our people,
educate our children.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.164
And, yes, we will defend ourselves.

46:37.327 --> 46:40.035
We will fight to defend ourselves!

46:42.232 --> 46:44.678
I'll take a breath while you write
all that down.

46:58.582 --> 47:01.961
Mm. I get to go home
to my cuddle bug now.

47:02.119 --> 47:03.257
Oh, how old?

47:03.420 --> 47:06.594
Three and a half, or as he says
three and a half and three quarters.

47:07.357 --> 47:09.633
- Here, after you.
- Thanks.

47:42.759 --> 47:46.172
He just keeps on flipping
through the pages of his case book...

47:46.330 --> 47:49.106
...while the professor waits.
The whole class waits.

47:49.266 --> 47:52.304
Flipping and flipping
like a crazy man.

47:52.669 --> 47:56.515
I guess he thought if he did it long
enough the professor would just give up.

47:57.107 --> 47:58.984
And-- And did he?

47:59.676 --> 48:00.950
What?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.358
Give up.

48:03.513 --> 48:04.514
Yeah.

48:04.815 --> 48:07.853
Called on Tommy Barton,
like always.

48:08.218 --> 48:13.167
Mm. Hm... And that's-- Um...
That's Professor Trau?

48:13.323 --> 48:14.597
No, Trau's contracts.

48:14.992 --> 48:16.869
This was con law,
Professor Easterbrook.

48:17.027 --> 48:19.530
Ah. Oh...

48:27.771 --> 48:30.149
There's this girl at work...

48:30.307 --> 48:33.584
...who says that it's illegal...

48:33.744 --> 48:38.215
...that News of the Week
only hires men as writers.

48:38.815 --> 48:40.123
How's that?

48:40.584 --> 48:45.556
Um, because of the Civil Rights Act
or something.

48:45.722 --> 48:52.765
Um, this girl says that it makes
discrimination against us illegal.

48:52.930 --> 48:58.039
Like, you know, saying that women
can only have some jobs.

48:58.201 --> 48:59.908
That law's untested.

49:00.070 --> 49:03.483
I doubt it will hold up in the Supreme
Court, if it even gets that far.

49:03.640 --> 49:07.452
Some southern senator put the women
thing in just to try to kill the bill.

49:07.611 --> 49:11.252
Figured people would never vote
for a law making women equal at work.

49:13.650 --> 49:15.561
They did.
