I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.139
- I DO. HER MOM
MAKES IT KIND OF TOUGH.

00:09.250 --> 00:12.139
SHE ONLY LETS HER COME UP
FROM L.A. ONCE A MONTH.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.218

IN MY EMPLOYMENT SITUATION.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.867

LAST ORDER OF BUSINESS.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.328
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THE SCHOOL DANCE.

00:37.450 --> 00:39.304
- A DANCE IS UNNECESSARY.

00:39.410 --> 00:41.162
WE'RE USING THE BUDGET

00:41.280 --> 00:43.032
- MAX, CAN WE DROP
THE VENDING MACHINE

00:43.140 --> 00:44.107
FOR JUST A SECOND?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.178

DO WE WANT TO FUND A DANCE?

00:59.810 --> 01:00.845
- NO.
- OF COURSE.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.599

01:02.710 --> 01:04.678
WANTS TO HAVE A DANCE, OKAY?
- EXCEPT FOR ME.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.668
AND I'M THE PRESIDENT,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

01:06.790 --> 01:07.882
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

01:07.990 --> 01:11.266
HOW ABOUT ALL IN FAVOR OF HAVING
A DANCE, RAISE YOUR HAND?

01:11.380 --> 01:12.859
MAJORITY RULES.

01:23.770 --> 01:26.978
VETO. VETO. VETO.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.832
- OH, MY GOD.

01:28.950 --> 01:31.908
IS THAT THE PASTA MAKER
WE GOT FROM OUR WEDDING?

01:32.020 --> 01:33.703
- I LIBERATED IT
FROM THE BOTTOM CUPBOARD.

01:33.810 --> 01:34.799
- WOW.
I'M IMPRESSED.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.536

02:02.840 --> 02:05.468
IF I'D BE HIS FOREMAN.

02:05.570 --> 02:06.662

PRETI'Y INTERESTING.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.567
- YEAH, CARL'S A GREAT GUY,

TRANSITIONAL PERIOD

02:16.580 --> 02:20.061
FOR ALL OF US WITH VICTOR,
SO HE'S GOT TO BE THE PRIORITY.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.893
I'M JUST GONNA GET HIM

03:39.630 --> 03:40.415
I MEAN, HE COULD BARELY
SAY HIS OWN NAME.

IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, LIKE, A...

03:58.270 --> 03:59.714
LEPRECHAUN OR SOMETHING.

03:59.820 --> 04:01.959

04:22.020 --> 04:23.772

04:57.260 --> 04:59.046
I'M GONNA BE
A HORRIBLE DAD.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.559

SHE DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.676
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH ME.

_ THIS IS A GOOD RESUME,
FOR THE MOST PART.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.215
I LIKE "FIELD REPRESENTATIVE."
THAT SOUNDS PROFESSIONAL.

07:34.550 --> 07:37.553
IF I COULD PARK

TWO--DESIGNATED

07:40.390 --> 07:41.721

I SAID I'LL DO A BOOTH.

08:49.490 --> 08:50.479
I DON'T KNOW.

08:50.590 --> 08:52.148
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE ARE SIZES.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.117

09:33.600 --> 09:35.352

ANYTHING WEIRD, RIGHT?

09:35.470 --> 09:37.392
- I'LL NEVER TELL.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.491

A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.818
WHEW.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.195

I WAS DRUNK.

09:49.310 --> 09:50.686

10:47.020 --> 10:47.748
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH, AND PAMMY--

10:47.850 --> 10:49.772
EIGHT KIDS.
- WOW.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.984

10:53.100 --> 10:54.818
- OH, IT SOUNDS
TOTALLY FUN,

10:54.930 --> 10:56.306
BUT I'M--
I HAVE SUCH A BUSY DAY.

10:56.410 --> 10:58.196
I'M JUST RUNNING OFF TO--
- WE CAN TELL YOU

10:58.310 --> 11:00.619
ABOUT ALL THE TEACHERS THAT HAVE
A CRUSH ON YOUR HUSBAND.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.096
[school bell rings]
- THE LIST IS LONG.

11:02.210 --> 11:03.302
[both laughing]
- OH, I'M SURE.

11:03.420 --> 11:05.308
- WE NEVER GET TO HANG
WITH YOU. PLEASE...

11:05.420 --> 11:07.138
- PLEASE...
- UM...

11:07.250 --> 11:08.035
- NO IS NOT AN OPTION.

11:08.150 --> 11:09.481
- COME ON,
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

11:09.590 --> 11:10.932
WE'RE PARKED IN THE BACK.
- OKAY.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.497
- SO, BUDDY, WE HEAR YOU'RE
QUITE THE FILIBUSTER KING.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.283
- I'M NOT "FILIBUSTING"
ANYTHING.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.699
- YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
IN THE WAY OF SOME PROJECTS

11:17.810 --> 11:19.698
THAT OTHER KIDS IN
THE STUDENT COUNCIL WANT TO DO.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.254
YOUR ADVISOR, WHO SAYS
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB

11:21.370 --> 11:22.814
RUNNING THE MEETING'S AGENDA,
IS CONCERNED

11:22.920 --> 11:24.364
THAT EVERY TIME THESE KIDS
BRING UP THIS DANCE,

11:24.470 --> 11:26.847
YOU JUST KEEP SAYING NO.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.678
- YEAH, IT'S CALLED A VETO.

11:28.790 --> 11:29.859
- BUDDY, IF YOU WANT TO BE
A SUCCESSFUL LEADER,

11:29.960 --> 11:32.713
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

11:32.830 --> 11:33.990
- THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S PART
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.888
- ALONG WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.139
- AND IT'S A DANCE.
IT'S FUN.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.274
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S A WASTE OF THE BUDGET.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.937
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE VENDING MACHINE YET.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.416
- IT SOUNDS TO ME
FROM YOUR ADVISOR

11:44.530 --> 11:45.974
LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THESE KIDS
WANT TO HAVE THE DANCE.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.524
- THEY DO. THEY DO.
- SO YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF

11:47.630 --> 11:48.699
SOME TROUBLE AND AGGRAVATION
BY JUST LE'ITING IT HAPPEN.

11:48.810 --> 11:51.119
- I THINK THAT'S
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN.

11:51.220 --> 11:53.427
- COMPROMISE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:53.540 --> 11:55.110
- FINE.

11:55.230 --> 11:57.323
- GREAT.
- GOOD.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.499
- BUT I'M NOT GOING.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.679
- OH, MAX, YOU'RE GOING.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.714
- NOPE.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.544

12:08.650 --> 12:09.719

12:09.830 --> 12:11.684
FOXY.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.892
WHICH, UH--WHICH ONE?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.059

THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.148
- CUTE.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.410
- MM.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.929

12:20.040 --> 12:21.667

AND THE COSTUME WE'LL BE WEARING

12:21.770 --> 12:23.829
IN THE SUITE THAT I GOT.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.565

12:28.160 --> 12:29.388
- WHERE WERE WE--
IN THE CHARDONNAY SHACK?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.320
- SOME WHITE WINE.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.702
NOW WE'RE IN THE MERLOT SUITE,
WHERE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.367
- [laughs]
OH, MY GOD, HONEY.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.574
THAT'S SO NICE. MM.

12:49.140 --> 12:50.346

OF YOUR FAVORITE STUFF.

12:50.450 --> 12:51.724
- I LOVE THAT ONE, BUT...

12:51.840 --> 12:54.343
WELL, UH, GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
JUST CALLED TOO.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.451
SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'D
LIKE TO EAT THIS WEEKEND.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.697
SO YOU SHOULD CALL
THEM BACK.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.040
- I'LL PROBABLY JUST, LIKE,
MAKE STUFF HERE.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.947
- NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE STAYING
WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA

13:02.050 --> 13:02.846
WHEN WE GO TO THE WEDDING,
REMEMBER?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.087
- WHY CAN'T I JUST STAY HERE?

13:04.190 --> 13:06.078
- NO. YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE
BY YOURSELF.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.817
WE--WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.888
- YOU'RE STAYING
AT GRANDMA AND GRANDPA'S.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.537
I DON'T THINK YOU LISTEN
TO ANYTHING I SAY.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.163
- FOR WHAT REASON?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

13:13.270 --> 13:14.578
AND YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE
BY YOURSELF.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.442
- YEAH, BUT WHEN AMBER WAS 17,
WE USED TO STAY ALONE.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.859
- WELL, I'VE LEARNED
A FEW THINGS SINCE THEN.

13:18.970 --> 13:21.200
- YEAH, AMBER'S CRAZY,
AND I'M NOT.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.868
- I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY, HONEY.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.039
- DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE?

13:24.140 --> 13:25.619
PLEASE.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.074

ALL RIGHT, FINE.

13:34.220 --> 13:37.041
[door closes]

13:45.820 --> 13:47.333
ITHINK, UM...

13:47.440 --> 13:49.783
I THINK MY BEVELS

13:49.890 --> 13:52.063
LOOK AT THAT.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.580
YOU SCREWED UP THE CORNER THERE,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.476

YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE HEAD SHOTS

14:04.320 --> 14:06.936

THIS WHOLE THING OUT WITH RUBY.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.074

14:09.530 --> 14:12.351
TO MY EX-WIFE, YOU KNOW,
WITHOUT ANY LAWYERS.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.051
AND I WAS THINKING
RUBY CAN HANG WITH YOU,

14:14.160 --> 14:15.843
BECAUSE YOU CONNECT WITH HER,
AND MAYBE YOU'LL FIND OUT--

14:15.950 --> 14:18.089

14:38.360 --> 14:40.419
- YEAH, YEAH,
I GOT TO GET DOWN THERE,

14:40.530 --> 14:42.589
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GONNA

14:42.700 --> 14:43.906
AND EVERYTHING.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.011
I JUST--I GOT TO GET DOWN THERE.
BUT IT'S OKAY.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.496

15:06.140 --> 15:08.199
SOME BIG GAPS

15:08.320 --> 15:10.038
- YES, SIR.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.141

ABOUT THAT?

15:12.250 --> 15:14.696

OUR COUNTRY, SIR.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.698
I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN

15:16.810 --> 15:18.425
- RIGHT.

15:18.530 --> 15:19.280
WELL, SEE, HERE, RYAN,

15:19.400 --> 15:20.708

15:20.810 --> 15:23.324
YOU'RE A SELF-STARTER,
THAT YOU'RE EASILY MOTIVATED,

15:23.430 --> 15:24.818
AND THIS THING
ABOUT AFGHANISTAN--

15:24.920 --> 15:26.399
JUST SAY YOU WERE GONE,
NOW YOU'RE BACK,

15:26.510 --> 15:28.228
AND THAT'S THE END
OF THE STORY.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.432
- OKAY.

15:29.540 --> 15:30.575
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.545
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WHEN I FIRST GOT BACK?

15:32.650 --> 15:33.856
- WHAT'S THAT?

15:33.960 --> 15:36.713
- WELL, I SOLD ENCYCLOPEDIAS
DOOR-TO-DOOR.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.969
- ENCYCLOPEDIA--
W-WHAT IS THAT?

15:39.070 --> 15:40.992
[chuckling]
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

15:41.110 --> 15:41.826
REALLY?
- THAT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

15:41.940 --> 15:42.895
- HOW DO YOU CARRY THEM ALL?

15:43.010 --> 15:44.238
- UH, YEAH, OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:44.350 --> 15:46.910
- SORRY.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.045
- SO, I MEAN, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA TELL THEM

15:48.150 --> 15:50.186
ABOUT YOUR LACK
OF SALES EXPERIENCE?

15:50.290 --> 15:53.111
- I'LL TELL THEM I CAN ASSEMBLE
AN M-16 IN 35 SECONDS

15:53.220 --> 15:54.084
IN THE DARK, UNDER FIRE.

15:54.190 --> 15:57.159
[chuckles]
JUST KIDDING.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.568
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL SAY, UH...

15:58.680 --> 16:00.193
I REALLY LOOK FORWARD
TO THIS OPPORTUNITY

16:00.300 --> 16:02.575
AND THAT I'M EXTREMELY
MOTIVATED--I WON'T DISAPPOINT.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.783
- ALL RIGHT.
A'ITA BOY.

16:03.890 --> 16:06.336
YOU KNOW, THAT--
YOU CAN REALLY ASSEMBLE

16:06.440 --> 16:08.544
AN M-16 IN UNDER 35 SECONDS?

16:08.650 --> 16:11.369
- ABOUT THAT.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.720
- BOY.

16:16.870 --> 16:19.896
- HI, BUD.

16:20.010 --> 16:22.353
MAX.
- WHAT?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.189
- I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
- I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

16:24.290 --> 16:24.938
- I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
SURPRISES.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.109
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.085
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.
- THREE SECONDS. READY?

16:29.190 --> 16:31.602
ONE, TWO, THREE.
- THEY HAVE COLLARS.

16:31.710 --> 16:32.916
- YES, THEY HAVE COLLARS
BECAUSE THEY'RE DRESS SHIRTS.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.193
- OKAY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.267
THEY'RE NOT DRESSES.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.985
AND I HATE
THAT KIND OF SHIRT.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.954
- I KNOW THAT YOU HATE
THIS KIND OF SHIRT, BUT--

16:40.060 --> 16:40.810
- THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.
- I CHECKED THESE.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.261
THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY SOl-T.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.133
AND I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE
YOU COULD TRY ONE ON--

16:45.240 --> 16:46.821
I KIND OF LIKE THE BLUE ONE--

16:46.930 --> 16:49.069
AND YOU COULD WEAR ONE
TO THE DANCE.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.442
- I'M NOT GOING TO THE DANCE.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.209
- I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO GO TO THE DANCE.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.764
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE DANCE.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.906
- MAX, BUT LISTEN TO ME--IT'S
PART OF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.318
YOU SHOULD GO TO A DANCE
AT LEAST ONCE.

16:57.430 --> 16:58.522
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE DANCE!

16:58.630 --> 17:01.383
- I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL
A LITTLE SCARED--

17:01.500 --> 17:05.459
- OKAY, I'M NOT SCARED!
I'M NOT GOING TO THE DANCE!

17:05.570 --> 17:07.117
- DON'T YELL AT ME.
DON'T YELL AT ME, OKAY?

17:07.230 --> 17:08.913
I DID SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU.
- HEY, GUYS.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.055
MAX, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'M NOT DOING IT.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.468
I'M NOT DOING IT.
I'M NOT DOING IT...

17:11.580 --> 17:13.059
- I GOT HIM THESE SHIRTS.
- THOSE ARE SOME NICE SHIRTS.

17:13.170 --> 17:14.432
- I'M NOT WEARING THEM
TO THE DANCE!

17:14.550 --> 17:15.812
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

17:15.930 --> 17:16.919
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE DANCE.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.236
- [scoffs]
- WHAT?

17:18.340 --> 17:19.716
- WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.650
BOTH OF YOU, JUST FORGET IT.
- YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER--

17:21.760 --> 17:22.727
HEY, HONEY.
- FORGET IT!

17:22.830 --> 17:24.172
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
YOU OKAY?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.929
HONEY, LOOK, WHY DON'T WE JUST
PACK UP THE KIDS--

17:26.040 --> 17:27.314
- HE IS GOING
TO THE DANCE, OKAY?

17:27.420 --> 17:28.762
THE KID'S GOING TO THE DANCE.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.280
- LOOK, WE JUST AVERTED
THE STUDENT COUNCIL CRISIS.

17:30.390 --> 17:31.937
WHY DON'T WE JUST
LET THIS ONE GO?

17:32.050 --> 17:35.042
[feet stomping up stairs]

17:35.150 --> 17:37.209
[door slams]

17:37.330 --> 17:38.354
- HOW WAS YOUR MEETING?

17:38.470 --> 17:40.779
- WELL, UH,
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.189
YOUR DAD IS GONNA BE OVERSEEING
THE CONSTRUCTION

17:43.300 --> 17:47.191
OF A SUPER-COOL,
HUGE BUILDING IN WEST BERKELEY.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.188
ISN'T THAT AWESOME?
- CAN WE GO SEE IT TOMORROW?

17:49.300 --> 17:50.710
- CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE HATS
WITH THE LIGHT ON IT?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.924
- UH, YES, AND SOON.
YEAH.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.201
- WOW.
- YEAH.

17:54.310 --> 17:55.584
- THIS IS--
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.032
- DEAL WENT THROUGH, AND,
YOU KNOW, IT ALL LOOKS GOOD.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.995
I JUST GOT TO
HIRE THE GUYS AND...

18:00.110 --> 18:01.509
- CONGRATULATIONS.
WOW.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.006
- THANK YOU.

18:03.110 --> 18:06.147
HOW WAS, UM--
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.878
- [clears throat]
IT WAS, UH, GOOD. IT WAS GREAT.

18:08.980 --> 18:11.528
I MADE HOMEMADE PASTA AGAIN...

18:11.640 --> 18:13.221
ALTHOUGH THE KIDS HAVE
NOW TOLD ME

18:13.330 --> 18:15.048
THAT THEY PREFER
THE STORE-BOUGHT KIND.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.253
AND I WENT
TO WEDNESDAY COFFEE CLUB

18:17.370 --> 18:18.849
WITH SOME OF THE MOMS.

18:18.950 --> 18:21.020
- MM.
[chuckles] OKAY.

18:21.130 --> 18:23.189
YEAH.
LIKE CHRISTINE AND--

18:23.300 --> 18:25.689
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY, HOW WAS THAT?

18:25.790 --> 18:27.519
- S-SUPER FUN.
- MM-HMM.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.963
- CAN I PUT PARMESAN
ON YOUR PASTA?

18:30.070 --> 18:32.413
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.305
THANK YOU.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.729
JUST A LITTLE BIT,
THOUGH.

18:35.830 --> 18:36.819
- WELL, IT NEEDS A LOT.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.829
[rock music]

18:59.650 --> 19:00.639
- ...THIS WITH YOU AGAIN!
- IS IT COSBY?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.923
OH, IS THIS
THE RECORDING STU--HEY!

19:04.030 --> 19:05.236
- CROSBY, I--
- CROSBY BRAVERMAN!

19:05.350 --> 19:07.682
- NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE!

19:07.800 --> 19:10.268
- ONCE AGAIN, SOMEBODY
FROM YOUR STUDIO

19:10.390 --> 19:12.551
HAS MANAGED TO BLOCK
MY PARKING SPACES.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.002
ONLY THIS TIME,
MY CAR IS IN--

19:14.110 --> 19:15.793
- YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BARGE INTO MY SESSION.

19:15.910 --> 19:17.525
- SO I CAN GO NOWHERE!

19:17.630 --> 19:19.211
- PEOPLE PAY ME,
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO

19:19.330 --> 19:21.082
OUT THAT EXIT DOOR
AND LEAVE?

19:21.190 --> 19:22.737
- I'M CALLING
THE COPS RIGHT NOW.

19:22.850 --> 19:24.465
- I FORGOT. YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS? CALL THE COPS.

19:24.570 --> 19:26.014
BECAUSE THIS IS A COMPLAINT.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.358
I FILED IT WITH THE CITY
AGAINST--

19:27.470 --> 19:28.607
- OKAY, GREAT!
OKAY, GOOD.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.154
- ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, GREAT. TH ROW IT AWAY.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.716
I GOT TEN MORE.
AND BY THE WAY...

19:32.820 --> 19:35.573
WHOEVER HAS THE MUSTANG,
YOU'RE BEING TOWED!

19:35.690 --> 19:37.260
YOU'RE BEING TOWED!
- ARE YOU--

19:37.380 --> 19:38.540
- YOU'RE BEING TOWED!

19:38.660 --> 19:41.720
- I MEAN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THIS WOMAN?

19:41.830 --> 19:42.751
_ 1--
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:42.870 --> 19:43.825
- CROSBY...

19:43.940 --> 19:47.171
- HOW WAS THAT?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.599
CROSBY?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.660
- DON'T DRINK THOSE.

19:52.770 --> 19:53.839
- YOU KNOW THIS
IS ALL I EAT NOW.

19:53.950 --> 19:55.258
- I MADE THIS FOR YOU.
THAT'S NOT A FOOD.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.975
- OKAY, IS IT SAFE
IF I WALK TO SCHOOL ALONE?

19:57.090 --> 19:59.320
AM I OLD ENOUGH YET
FOR THAT ONE?

19:59.430 --> 20:00.818
- TO WALK TO SCHOOL BY YOURSELF?
- YEAH.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.808
- I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU HAVE
A BUDDY YOU CAN HOLD HANDS WITH?

20:02.920 --> 20:04.262
- HERE, I'LL SELL THIS.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.883
- GREAT.
BYE.

20:05.990 --> 20:06.547
- BYE.
- SEE YOU IN A COUPLE.

20:06.650 --> 20:07.810
- [sighs]

20:07.930 --> 20:10.091
- HOW CAN HE BE MAD AT ME

20:10.200 --> 20:12.998
THAT I DON'T WANT HIM
TO STAY BY HIMSELF IN THE HOUSE

20:13.100 --> 20:15.409
AI-TER HE, YOU KNOW...
YOU KNOW.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.657
- IF IT WAS TOTALLY UP TO ME,

20:16.760 --> 20:19.069
THEN I PROBABLY WOULD'VE LET
THEM STAY HERE.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.341
YOU KNOW,
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE SEX,

20:21.460 --> 20:22.791
THEY'RE GONNA FIND A PLACE
TO HAVE SEX.

20:22.910 --> 20:24.389
- OH, NO, THEY'RE NOT.
- AND THEY MIGHT AS WELL DO IT

20:24.490 --> 20:25.696
IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.357
- NO, NO, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA FIND A PLACE.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.519
SEE, THIS 15--
HOW IT WORKS IS

20:29.640 --> 20:31.596
I WILL ELIMINATE
ALL THE AVAILABLE PLACES

20:31.710 --> 20:33.359
WHERE THEY COULD
DO THAT THING, AND THEN--

20:33.470 --> 20:36.052
- HOW DO YOU ELIMINATE
ALL THE PLACES?

20:36.160 --> 20:37.536
- ONE ROOM AT A TIME.

20:37.650 --> 20:38.742
- [laughing]
ONE ROOM AT A TIME.

20:38.850 --> 20:40.192
- WHAT TIME IS IT?
I HAVE TO GO.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.232
- IT IS ABOUT 7:00, 7:33.
- YOU HAVE TO GO.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.229
I HAVE AN EXTRA PERIOD
OFF TODAY.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.887
- HANK IS JUST...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.069
YOU KNOW, SO THIS WEEKEND--

20:47.170 --> 20:50.298
HE SPRINGS ON ME
WE HAVE A JOB IN LA.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.240
ALL OF A SUDDEN ON FRIDAY.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.339
- THIS WEEKEND?
- YEAH. AND, UH--

20:53.450 --> 20:56.248
- BUT HE--HE KNOWS
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

20:56.350 --> 20:57.760
- WELL, NOW HE DOES.
I MEAN, HE FORGOT.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.998
AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY WANTED ME
TO COME WITH HIM ON FRIDAY,

21:01.120 --> 21:02.564
AND I--I TOLD HIM I CAN'T.
- GOOD.

21:02.670 --> 21:06.356
- BUT IF I WENT TO L.A.
AND I DID THE JOB, AND THEN--

21:06.470 --> 21:07.949
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A BUNCH OF FLIGHTS.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.256
AND MAYBE I COULD EVEN GET
A FLIGHT INTO SANTA ROSA,

21:09.370 --> 21:11.577
YOU KNOW, FRIDAY NIGHT
OR FIRST THING--

21:11.680 --> 21:13.534
THE WORST WOULD BE
FIRST THING SATURDAY MORNING.

21:13.650 --> 21:16.118
- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THAT?
- HERE'S WHAT I THINK.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.265
I--YOU KNOW, YOU TOLD HIM
AHEAD OF TIME.

21:18.380 --> 21:20.098
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS
FOR MONTHS.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.337
I'VE BEEN REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.065
- ME TOO.
- I TOOK THE DAY OFF TOO.

21:23.170 --> 21:24.410
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, THIS IS, LIKE--

21:24.520 --> 21:25.373
THIS IS OUR WEEKEND.
- IT'S OUR WEEKEND. I KNOW.

21:25.490 --> 21:27.549
I'M SORRY I ASKED.
IT'S JUST--

21:27.660 --> 21:30.584
- THAT'S FINE. I-I JUST--
YEAH, HE...

21:32.360 --> 21:35.318
- THIS IS WHAT SHE FILED
WITH THE CITY.

21:35.430 --> 21:36.943
SHE CALLS IT
AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT,

21:37.050 --> 21:39.189
BUT IT SAYS "ZONING NOTICE"
ON IT, SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:39.290 --> 21:40.393
- LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.660
- WHAT IS SHE TRYING TO PULL
WITH THIS THING?

21:41.780 --> 21:43.224
- OH, GOSH, CROS,
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

21:43.330 --> 21:44.501
IN FACT,
I WILL HAVE MY COLLEAGUE

21:44.610 --> 21:45.986
WHO DEALS
WITH MUNICIPAL COMPLAINTS

21:46.090 --> 21:47.432
TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR YOU.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.883
I'M SURE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
- I WANT TO BURY THIS WOMAN.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.857
I THINK THAT I HAVE
A DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST HER.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.643
- SHE'S ASSASSINATING
YOUR CHARACTER?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.204
- YEAH, SHE WALKED IN
IN FRONT OF CLIENTS

21:56.310 --> 21:59.108
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SESSION AND
STARTED BLASTING MY CHARACTER.

21:59.210 --> 22:00.962
SO, YEAH, DEFAMATION
DOES NOT SEEM

22:01.070 --> 22:03.004
OUT OF THE REALM
OF POSSIBILITY--

22:03.110 --> 22:04.554
OR MAYBE A RESTRAINING ORDER
OR SOMETHING.

22:04.660 --> 22:07.834
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU MY BEST LEGAL ADVICE.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.659
- OKAY, WHAT IS YOUR BEST
LEGAL ADVICE?

22:10.770 --> 22:13.147
- BE NICE.

22:13.260 --> 22:14.466
DO NOT INFLAME
THE SITUATION ANY MORE.

22:14.570 --> 22:15.878
- BE NICE IS YOUR SUGGESTION?

22:15.980 --> 22:18.460
- DO NOT ENGAGE THIS WOMAN.
- NOT AN INJUNCTION...

22:18.570 --> 22:20.982
OR SOME KIND OF SEIZURE...
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.648
- OR VACATE THE PREM--
- DO NOT TALK TO HER.

22:22.750 --> 22:23.978
AND IF, PERCHANCE,
YOU ENCOUNTER HER,

22:24.100 --> 22:27.228
JUST BE NICE TO HER.

22:27.340 --> 22:28.750
WHAT DOES ADAM SAY ABOUT IT?

22:28.860 --> 22:31.476
- HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING,
BECAUSE I'M HANDLING THIS.

22:31.590 --> 22:34.514
I'M GONNA HANDLE IT
LIKE I HANDLE MY BUSINESS.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.134
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.036
DO YOU HAVE ANY MILK,
BY CHANCE?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.141
- MM-HMM.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.841
- NORA'S ASLEEP.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.874
- THANK YOU.
- YEP.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.576
REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.535
- YOU FINISHED IT ALL?
- I DID.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.789
AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- SO INSENSITIVE.

23:00.890 --> 23:03.199
- MY MOUTH
IS SO DRY LATELY, SO...

23:03.310 --> 23:05.164
- HEY...

23:05.280 --> 23:08.511
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS DANCE?

23:08.620 --> 23:09.609
- SURE. WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

23:09.730 --> 23:11.869
- OKAY, SO LET'S CONSIDER
OUR OPTIONS.

23:11.970 --> 23:14.552
- OKAY.
- WE COULD RECONSIDER...

23:14.660 --> 23:16.355
ALLOWING MAX NOT TO GO--
LET HIM OFF THE HOOK.

23:16.460 --> 23:20.806
OR WE COULD STILL PUSH HIM
TO GO...

23:20.910 --> 23:23.538
IN WHICH CASE,
I WANT TO SAY...

23:23.640 --> 23:27.599
THERE WILL BE MORE DANCES,
KRISTINA.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.087
AND THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

23:31.890 --> 23:34.541
COME ON.

23:34.650 --> 23:37.164

ABOUT EVERYTHING.

23:37.270 --> 23:40.205
I DO.

23:40.310 --> 23:41.925
BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE,

23:42.040 --> 23:46.272
AND I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU...

23:46.390 --> 23:51.589
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH TIME...

23:51.700 --> 23:53.213
kwmm
THEREIS.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.764
NONE OF US DO, YOU KNOW?

23:54.880 --> 23:57.633
- MM-HMM.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.629
- I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT
ON ANY MILESTONES.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.052
THAT'S ALL.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.819
- OKAY.

24:09.930 --> 24:13.787
THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.522
BYE.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.598
- MCSHANE AND KYLE,

24:30.710 --> 24:31.836
BY SOME MIRACLE
OR ACT OF GOD,

24:31.950 --> 24:37.183
ARE--ARE BOTH FREE
AND ARE STARTING TUESDAY.

24:39.060 --> 24:43.099
- THAT'S GREAT.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.168
- IT IS REALLY GREAT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

24:45.270 --> 24:47.784
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:47.900 --> 24:49.583
HONESTLY, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU SAID YES THE SAME DAY

24:49.690 --> 24:51.442
THAT WE AGREED
VICTOR'S OUR PRIORITY.

24:51.550 --> 24:56.078
- VICTOR IS OUR PRIOR--
WAIT. I'M SORRY.

24:56.180 --> 24:58.796
I'M SORRY, WHAT--IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

24:58.910 --> 25:00.241
- WE HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON

25:00.360 --> 25:02.316
IN BUILDING THIS RELATIONSHIP,
AND IT'S FRAGILE,

25:02.430 --> 25:03.419
AND YOU'RE BAILING ON US.

25:03.530 --> 25:05.805
- WAIT.
I'M BAILING ON THE FAMILY?

25:05.910 --> 25:07.468
- THAT'S WHAT I FEEL LIKE!
- IS WHAT WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE?

25:07.570 --> 25:08.878
- YES!
- ONE OF US HAS TO MAKE MONEY!

25:08.990 --> 25:10.639
- AND I THINK YOU SHOULD GET
YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.978
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:12.090 --> 25:13.671
WAIT. I'M SORRY.
- I'M NOT KIDDING YOU AT ALL.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.088
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS--
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.668
HAVE I EVER--IN THE HISTORY
OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER,

25:17.790 --> 25:20.714
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
NOT TO TAKE A JOB

25:20.820 --> 25:22.469
OR A CASE OR...
- WELL, NO, BUT--

25:22.590 --> 25:24.581
- EVEN SKIP OUT ON LUNCH
WITH THE PARTNERS?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.681
- NO, BUT THAT'S NOT--
- HAVE I EVER ONCE ASKED YOU

25:26.800 --> 25:28.791
TO JUST NOT READ BRIEFS
WHILE WE'RE ON VACATION

25:28.900 --> 25:30.447
OR DOCK LESS HOURS?
- I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.790
- NO, I HAVE NEVER
ASKED YOU THAT!

25:32.910 --> 25:35.458
I HAVE NEVER ASKED THAT OF YOU,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

25:35.560 --> 25:37.972
I RESPECT YOU.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.015
I THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD WORK
AND STILL BE A PARENT.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.567
AND I WISH YOU COULD JUST
PAY ME THAT SAME COURTESY.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.719
[door slams]

26:03.140 --> 26:05.381
- HEY.

26:05.490 --> 26:07.651
THANK YOU FOR, UH,
MEETING ME OUT HERE.

26:07.770 --> 26:09.931
I THINK WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

26:10.050 --> 26:12.871
AND I WOULD LOVE TO START OVER,
IF YOU'RE OPEN TO IT.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.119
I MADE YOU A BASKET HERE
WITH SOME CDs

26:15.220 --> 26:17.871
FROM ARTISTS THAT HAVE
RECORDED AT THE LUNCHEONE'ITE

26:17.990 --> 26:19.946
OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS.

26:20.060 --> 26:22.016
AND THERE'S ALSO SOME WINE
AND LOCAL CHEESE

26:22.130 --> 26:24.405
AND REALLY GOOD
GORGONZOLA ON THERE.

26:24.510 --> 26:26.671
LOOK, UM...
- [clears throat]

26:26.790 --> 26:28.360
- I-I WOULD LIKE
TO SINCERELY APOLOGIZE

26:28.480 --> 26:31.586
FOR THE BEHAVIOR
OF THE MUSICIANS

26:31.690 --> 26:33.544
HANGING OUT IN THE--
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE...

26:33.660 --> 26:36.379
COMING OVER HERE,
BRINGING A BASKET OF THINGS,

26:36.490 --> 26:37.514
WHEN YOU'VE DONE NOTHING AT ALL

26:37.630 --> 26:40.201
TO ADDRESS THE NOISE
AND THE LI'ITER

26:40.320 --> 26:41.457
COMING FROM YOUR BUILDING.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.903
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I PAID FOR MY CONDO?

26:44.010 --> 26:46.661
- NO, HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY--
- $900,000.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.658
- CONGRATS.
900,000? WOW.

26:48.770 --> 26:51.705
- I DO NOT PAY
A $900,000 MORTGAGE

26:51.810 --> 26:53.846
SO I CAN FINANCE
MUSICIANS' PARKING

26:53.950 --> 26:56.532
AND PICK CIGARETTES
OUT OF MY PLANTS!

26:56.640 --> 26:58.528
- OKAY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU MOVED?

26:58.650 --> 27:00.504
TO THE HAIGHT
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

27:00.610 --> 27:02.498
THIS ISN'T CONNECTICUT.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.951
THIS PLACE WAS MADE FAMOUS
BY POT SMOKERS

27:04.070 --> 27:07.130
AND ACID TAKERS AND FREE LOVE
AND THE HELLS ANGELS.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.446
YOU'RE FREAKED OUT

27:08.550 --> 27:09.687
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET YOUR BIG,
CUMBERSOME RANGE ROVER

27:09.800 --> 27:12.132
IN AND OUT
OF YOUR PARKING SPOT?

27:12.250 --> 27:14.138
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU NEED TO MOVE!

27:14.250 --> 27:16.593
- GET AWAY FROM MY PROPERTY!
- OKAY, I WILL, I WILL.

27:16.700 --> 27:20.693
- ALSO, BY THE WAY...
- WHAT?

27:20.810 --> 27:22.732
- OH, VERY CLASSY.
- DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR THOSE.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.182
- NO, BUT TAKE THE WINE.

27:24.290 --> 27:25.461
- I WILL!
- GOD KNOWS YOU DON'T MAKE

27:25.570 --> 27:26.776
ENOUGH MONEY
TO BUY YOUR OWN BOTTLE.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.390
- HEY.

27:32.510 --> 27:34.193
- WHAT'S UP? HEY.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.507
- I GOT COFFEE AND, UM,
LEMON POPPY SEED MUFFINS.

27:36.620 --> 27:37.746
DO YOU WANT ONE?

27:37.860 --> 27:39.259
- FROM WHO, THE WEIRD GUY
WITH THE GLASSES?

27:39.380 --> 27:41.689
- NO, FROM THE OTHER PLACE.
- THE GOOD PLACE?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.963
YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY.
- IT'S NOT OUT OF THE WAY.

27:44.070 --> 27:46.868
- IT'S, LIKE, HALF A MILE.
- IT'S, LIKE, A COUPLE BLOCKS.

27:46.970 --> 27:48.449
- AT LEAST A QUARTER OF A MILE.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.141
- ALL RIGHT,
I WENT OUT OF MY WAY.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.172
- THANK YOU.
COOL.

27:54.180 --> 27:56.216
I MIGHT JUST EAT THE TOP AGAIN.
YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.218
- SURE.

27:57.330 --> 27:59.184
[sighs]

27:59.290 --> 28:01.599
I CAN'T GO TO L.A.

28:01.710 --> 28:03.325
I'M SIORRY.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.748
- BOYFRIEND SAID NO?
- NO.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.647
HE'S MY FIANCE.
HE DIDN'T SAY NO.

28:06.750 --> 28:10.026
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.
WE HAD THIS PLAN.

28:10.130 --> 28:12.439
AND, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T BREAK IT.

28:12.550 --> 28:15.098
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:15.210 --> 28:17.371
- I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE
TO GO THIS WEEKEND?

28:17.480 --> 28:18.447
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN "B"?

28:18.550 --> 28:20.063
- NO, NO.
I GOT TO GO THIS WEEKEND.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.750
SHE ALREADY--
MY EX-WIFE CALLED.

28:21.870 --> 28:24.179
SHE MADE A-A DOWN PAYMENT
ON THE APARTMENT ALREADY.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.144
- WHERE? IN MINNESOTA?

28:25.250 --> 28:26.626
- DIDN'T EVEN 'IY'EISL ME ABOUT IT.

28:26.730 --> 28:28.140
- HOW CAN SHE DO THIS?
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.660
HOW--IS SHE KID--
- SHE DOES IT. SHE CAN DO IT.

28:29.770 --> 28:30.976
- SHE CAN JUST TAKE HER
OUT OF THE STATE?

28:31.080 --> 28:31.978
- YES.
- WHAT DOES THE LAWYER SAY?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.399
- THE LAWYER SAID
IT'S A SLAM DUNK.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.661
- HOW CAN IT BE A SLAM DUNK
TO TAKE A CHILD AWAY...

28:35.780 --> 28:37.156
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

28:37.260 --> 28:38.568
- FROM HER FATHER?

28:38.680 --> 28:41.331
- I KNOW. I'M SENDING AN EMAIL
NOW BACK TO THE GUY, BUT...

28:41.440 --> 28:43.886
THIS IS HOW SHE DOES IT!

28:43.990 --> 28:46.367
AH, I'M JUST GOING THIS WEEKEND.
I GOT TO GO.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.708
[keys clacking]

28:51.660 --> 28:53.309
- THE REHEARSAL DINNER'S
FRIDAY NIGHT.

28:53.420 --> 28:56.173
- I GET IT.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.339
I GOT TO...

28:58.460 --> 29:01.907
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.800
[door opens]

29:04.910 --> 29:06.525
- HI, BUDDY.
- HEY.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.733
- HOW ARE YOU?
- MWAH. GOOD.

29:08.850 --> 29:10.078
- GOOD.

29:10.190 --> 29:13.227
HEY, SO...
HOW'D THE INTERVIEW GO?

29:13.330 --> 29:15.503
- IT WENT.

29:15.610 --> 29:17.749
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

29:17.850 --> 29:20.922
- IT MEANS, UH,
GUY LOOKS AT ME AND GOES,

29:21.030 --> 29:22.782
"OH, WOW, YOU WERE
IN AFGHANISTAN?

29:22.890 --> 29:25.609
YOU EVER KILL ANYBODY?"

29:25.720 --> 29:26.618
[chuckles]

29:26.730 --> 29:29.130
- OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

29:29.250 --> 29:31.389
- YEAH.
I JUST LOOKED AT HIM.

29:31.490 --> 29:32.832
I WAS LIKE...

29:32.940 --> 29:35.283
I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

29:35.390 --> 29:36.834
YOU KNOW, I JUST...

29:36.940 --> 29:38.009
- [scoffs]

29:38.120 --> 29:39.007
- AND THAT WAS THE END
OF THAT.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.564
- WELL...
WHO WOULD SAY THAT?

29:40.670 --> 29:43.559
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT?
I MEAN...

29:43.670 --> 29:44.739
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
THERE'LL BE--

29:44.850 --> 29:46.078
- NO, IT IS.
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

29:46.190 --> 29:48.010
I MEAN, Al-TER ALL
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

29:48.130 --> 29:50.360
TO JUST SAY SOMETHING
THAT'S JUST--

29:50.470 --> 29:51.846
[sighs]

29:51.960 --> 29:53.814
I'M SORRY.

29:53.930 --> 29:55.818
[smooching]

29:55.930 --> 29:57.921
- UM, I'M GONNA TAKE--

29:58.030 --> 29:59.759
I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK
REAL QUICK.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.680
- WELL, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.303
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.580
- RYAN, ARE YOU SURE?

30:05.700 --> 30:06.826
- YEAH.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.549
- I DO--HEY.

30:35.410 --> 30:35.853
I DO RESPECT YOU.

30:38.730 --> 30:41.073
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO EVER FEEL

30:41.180 --> 30:45.549
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
FROM ME...

30:45.670 --> 30:47.809
EVER.

30:47.910 --> 30:49.832
- OKAY.

30:49.950 --> 30:50.939
- OKAY.

30:52.290 --> 30:54.497
SORRY.

30:54.610 --> 30:56.396
- THANK YOU.

30:57.780 --> 31:00.647
- IT'S JUST THIS WHOLE TIME
SINCE I'VE LEI-T WORK,

31:00.750 --> 31:02.604
I'VE BEEN JUST OVERWHELMED

31:02.720 --> 31:05.405
OR BORED OUT OF MY MIND.

31:05.510 --> 31:06.647
I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS STAY-AT-HOME-MOM THING.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.275
I'M NOT FULFILLED BY IT...

31:10.380 --> 31:11.415
YOU KNOW?

31:11.520 --> 31:15.035
THAT SOUNDS SO BAD.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.108
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

31:17.220 --> 31:18.972
- OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT
A TERRIBLE PERSON.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.904
YOU GOT FREE TIME
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.215
SO JUST...
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

31:26.330 --> 31:29.709
JUST...

31:29.810 --> 31:30.390
MAYBE ENJOY IT A LITTLE.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.775
- [chuckles]

31:32.890 --> 31:35.120
- TRY TO ENJOY IT A LITTLE?
- RIGHT.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.719
[knock at door]

31:38.820 --> 31:40.640
- MAX.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.160
I HAVE A BOOK FOR YOU

31:43.280 --> 31:44.656
ABOUT WORLD WAR II
FIGHTER PILOTS

31:44.760 --> 31:48.446
THAT YOU HAVE NOT READ.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.515
- THANKS.

31:49.630 --> 31:52.246
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:52.350 --> 31:54.215
PU'ITING TOGETHER A FIGHTER?

31:54.320 --> 31:56.493
- YEP.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.636
- HEY, DID YOU THINK ANYMORE
ABOUT THAT DANCE?

31:58.740 --> 32:00.947
- I'M NOT GOING.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.459
- YOUR MOM REALLY WANTS
TO SEE YOU GO.

32:12.270 --> 32:14.158
AND BECAUSE SHE'S SICK, WE'RE
GONNA DO SOME THINGS FOR HER

32:14.270 --> 32:16.477
THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.268
IT'S JUST PART
OF BEING GROWN UP...

32:25.390 --> 32:27.005
DOING SOMETHING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE,

32:27.110 --> 32:28.316
DOING THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.626
- I DON'T LIKE DOING THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.311
- IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO THINK
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

32:32.430 --> 32:34.944
I KNOW THAT.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.460
BUT I NEED YOU TO,

32:36.570 --> 32:40.051
JUST THIS ONCE.

32:40.160 --> 32:45.097
I WANT YOU TO GO TO THIS DANCE
FOR YOUR MOM.

32:46.930 --> 32:50.263
AND THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.508
- DID YOU HEAR ME?

32:56.620 --> 32:59.555
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.628

TO THE DANCE?

33:01.730 --> 33:02.458
- MM-HMM.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.528
- IS THAT A YES?

33:04.630 --> 33:07.758
- MM-HMM.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.529
- OKAY.

33:14.330 --> 33:16.389
- YOU SAID, AND I'M QUOTING,
THAT...

33:16.510 --> 33:19.058
"IT'S PROBABLY NO BIG DEAL."
- [sighs]

33:19.160 --> 33:21.435
- BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE A BIG DEAL.

33:21.550 --> 33:23.233
- YES, I CANNOT CLASSIFY IT
AS NO BIG DEAL.

33:23.340 --> 33:26.377
- WELL, HOW DO YOU CLASSIFY IT?
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.368
- CROS, THIS BUILDING
WAS BUILT--

33:28.480 --> 33:30.232
- THIS HISTORIC LANDMARK
BUILDING?

33:30.350 --> 33:31.863
- YES, THIS HISTORIC
LANDMARK BUILDING

33:31.970 --> 33:34.768
WAS BUILT
IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE.

33:34.870 --> 33:38.351
AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT HASN'T
COME UP UNTIL NOW, BUT--

33:38.460 --> 33:40.690
- WELL, ISN'T THERE, LIKE,
A STATUTE OF SOMETHING,

33:40.810 --> 33:43.597
OR EMINENT DO--
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN HERE FOREVER.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.871
- THAT DOES WORK IN YOUR FAVOR,
AND YOU DO HAVE A CASE.

33:45.980 --> 33:49.086
BUT ANGRY NEIGHBOR LADY DOES
HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON HERE.

33:49.190 --> 33:51.010
- OH, MY GOD, THIS IS NOT
HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.122
- SHE HAS HOMEOWNERS RIGHTS,
AND SHE...

33:54.230 --> 33:57.119
SHE COULD SHUT YOU DOWN.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.061
- WE CANNOT PUT THIS
ON ADAM'S PLATE.

34:03.830 --> 34:06.242

ABOUT IT.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.008
WELL, HOW'D
THE JOB INTERVIEW GO?

34:51.120 --> 34:51.563
DID HE LAND IT?

34:51.670 --> 34:53.490
- NO.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.046
AND...

34:56.160 --> 34:58.299
I DON'T KNOW.
IT...

34:58.400 --> 35:00.288
THE GUY STARTED, LIKE,
ASKING HIM

35:00.400 --> 35:03.608
ALL THESE RUDE QUESTIONS,
LIKE, ABOUT HIS PAST.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.019
AND I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT, AND IT--

35:07.130 --> 35:08.131
I DON'T KNOW--
IT SEEMED LIKE

35:08.240 --> 35:10.128
I MADE IT WORSE
OR SOMETHING AND--

35:10.240 --> 35:12.344
- YEAH.
WELL, HE GOT REJECT ED, RIGHT?

35:12.450 --> 35:14.031
I MEAN...

35:14.140 --> 35:17.200
I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS...

35:17.320 --> 35:21.029
THAT I FEEL WORRIED.

35:21.150 --> 35:23.732
SO YOU KNOW HOW, LIKE,
LAST WEEKEND

35:23.840 --> 35:26.638
WE WENT TO A FUNERAL
OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS

35:26.740 --> 35:28.537
FROM HIS UNIT?

35:28.640 --> 35:29.629
- UH-HUH.

35:29.740 --> 35:33.506
- AND THE GUY
HAD COMMI'ITED SUICIDE.

35:33.610 --> 35:35.362
AND SOMETHING
HAPPENED THERE,

35:35.470 --> 35:38.678
AND RYAN GOT REALLY UPSET
AND...

35:38.790 --> 35:39.984
UM...

35:40.100 --> 35:43.308
IT WAS JUST SCARY,
AND I...

35:43.410 --> 35:46.413
I GUESS I'M SURPRISED AT...

35:46.520 --> 35:49.648
HOW MUCH IT HURTS ME
TO SEE HIM IN SO MUCH PAIN

35:49.760 --> 35:51.899

SWEETHEART.

36:07.750 --> 36:11.538
AND WAR IS A PLACE
WHERE YOU...

36:11.650 --> 36:15.711
WHERE YOU LOSE
WHO YOU WERE.

36:15.820 --> 36:19.301
AND THEN IF YOU GET BACK,

36:19.410 --> 36:21.753
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OF WHO YOU...

36:21.860 --> 36:25.387
WHO YOU ARE.

36:25.490 --> 36:30.280
AND YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH
OF WHAT YOU MIGHT BECOME.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.620

YEAH.

36:32.740 --> 36:36.949

[man speaking on television]

36:47.170 --> 36:50.617
- HI.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.029
- THEY DIDN'T HAVE, UM,
SHRIMP THIS TIME,

36:53.140 --> 36:54.300
SO I GOT SCALLOPS.

36:54.410 --> 36:56.753
WILL THAT BE WEIRD?
- OH, NO. THAT'S GOOD.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.101
I LOVE SCALLOPS.
- GOOD.

36:59.210 --> 37:00.108
[sighs]

37:00.210 --> 37:01.768
HEY.

37:06.220 --> 37:10.429
SO, UM, LOOK, I...

37:10.530 --> 37:15.115
I JUST CAN'T
FIGURE OUT, UM...

37:15.230 --> 37:17.812
A WAY NOT TO GO TO L.A.
ON FRIDAY.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.127
BUT I THINK, UM,
WHAT I CAN FIGURE OUT

37:20.230 --> 37:21.504
IS COMING BACK THAT NIGHT.

37:21.610 --> 37:24.306
- WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:24.410 --> 37:26.401
- WELL, THIS JOB IN L.A.--
IT'S JUST TURN IN--

37:26.520 --> 37:28.135
IT'S TURNING INTO THIS
VERY COMPLICATED THING,

37:28.240 --> 37:31.368
AND HANK
DOES REALLY NEED ME THERE.

37:31.490 --> 37:34.345
AND I--IF I--
I CHECKED THE FLIGHTS,

37:34.450 --> 37:36.315
AND THERE'S AN L.A.X.
TO SANTA ROSA

37:36.420 --> 37:37.648
THAT WOULD GET ME IN--
- WAIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:37.770 --> 37:39.931
YOU--YOU--DIDN'T--
I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.359
- WE DID.
- YOU--RIGHT.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.563
AND YOU WERE GONNA GO TELL HIM
THAT YOU COULDN'T GO,

37:43.670 --> 37:45.251
'CAUSE WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS
FOR MONTHS,

37:45.360 --> 37:46.463
AND YOU GAVE HIM A--
- I KNOW. I JUST FEEL LIKE

37:46.570 --> 37:49.152
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY
TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE

37:49.260 --> 37:50.989
SO THAT I CAN BE THERE
FOR THE JOB

37:51.090 --> 37:52.671
AND THEN ALSO
HAVE OUR WEEKEND.

37:52.780 --> 37:53.815
IT'S JUST--IT ONLY CUTS
INTO IT A LITTLE BIT.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.229
- IT CUTS IT IN HALF.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.568
HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU
FOR TWO DAYS?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.375
- I DON'T TOTALLY
UNDERSTAND EITHER.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.163
BUT IT'S JUST--IT'S BECOME
THIS VERY COMPLICATED THING,

38:01.270 --> 38:03.784
AND I FEEL
OBLIGATED TO HIM TO WORK,

38:03.900 --> 38:06.039
AND HE'S ALSO GOT THIS REALLY
MESSED-UP PERSONAL SITUATION

38:06.140 --> 38:08.244
WHERE--
- I DON'T CARE!

38:08.350 --> 38:09.510
- OKAY, WELL, I MEAN--
- I DON'T CARE.

38:09.630 --> 38:11.279
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP SOMEBODY OUT.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.618
YOU KNOW, WE'LL STILL HAVE
OUR WONDERFUL WEEKEND.

38:12.730 --> 38:14.379
- WE WON'T! WE'VE BEEN
PLANNING THIS FOR MONTHS,

38:14.490 --> 38:15.866
AND THEN HE SAYS, "I NEED YOU,"
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

38:15.980 --> 38:17.311
YOU GO AND DO
WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO?

38:17.430 --> 38:18.761
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.801
- YOU'RE PICKING HIM UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DRUNK--

38:19.910 --> 38:21.468
- THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME.

38:21.570 --> 38:22.980
THAT HAPPENED THAT ONE TIME.
- NO, BUT HE--RIGHT.

38:23.090 --> 38:24.876
WELL, YOU'RE PUTTING HIM
ABOVE ME.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.878
- NO, I'M NOT! NO, I'M NOT.
- YEAH!

38:26.990 --> 38:28.503
WE PLANNED THIS FOR MONTHS.
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA GO.

38:28.610 --> 38:29.599
AND THEN HE GIVES YOU
A SOB STORY, AND THEN YOU--

38:29.720 --> 38:31.574
- IT'S JUST--I'M TRYING
TO DO MY JOB TOO!

38:31.680 --> 38:33.022
THIS IS NOT A SHIFT
AT THE RESTAURANT

38:33.130 --> 38:34.950
THAT I CAN JUST TAKE OFF, OKAY?
- BUT YOU GAVE HIM--

38:35.070 --> 38:36.549
- I KNOW, BUT THERE
WAS A COMPLICATION.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.277
SOMETHING CAME UP.
IT'S WORK.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.449
- ALL RIGHT.
- AND ALL I'M TRYING TO DO

38:39.550 --> 38:41.347
IS DO BOTH--I'M TRYING
TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.

38:41.450 --> 38:42.678
- DON'T--JUST DON'T BOTHER.
- NO, I WANT TO GO.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.653
I'M GOING TO BE
AT THE WEDDING.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.829
- JUST GO TO L.A.
YOU'RE NOT.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.555
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
TO THE WEDDING.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.241
DON'T BOTHER, OKAY?
- MARK, DON'T SAY THAT.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.554
- SERIOUSLY, DON'T BOTHER.
IT DOESN'T--YOU--

38:49.670 --> 38:52.764
TELL HIM
YOU'RE FREE ALL WEEKEND.

[footsteps approaching]

39:04.990 --> 39:06.366

- HI, BUD.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.779
JUST GE'ITING
THIS STUFF TOGETHER.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.588
[laughs]
HI.

39:13.690 --> 39:15.965
- DAD SAID IF I WENT
FOR 30 MINUTES,

39:16.070 --> 39:20.382
HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME,
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

39:20.490 --> 39:23.243
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A...

39:23.360 --> 39:25.624
A PLAN TO ME.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.903
I LIKE THE BLUE SHIRT.
IT'S VERY PRESIDENTIAL.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.488
I KNOW THAT YOU, UM,
YOU DON'T LIKE DANCES, SO...

39:31.610 --> 39:32.838
- NO, I-I DON'T.

39:32.950 --> 39:37.671
- BUT TONIGHT
IF YOU GET THE URGE TO DANCE,

39:37.780 --> 39:40.260
I WANT YOU TO WALK UP
TO A GIRL,

39:40.370 --> 39:42.304
AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK HER
IN THE EYE,

39:42.410 --> 39:44.753
AND I WANT YOU TO SAY,

39:44.860 --> 39:48.136
"HI, I'M MAX BRAVERMAN,
YOUR PRESIDENT.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.037
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DANCE WITH ME?"

39:50.140 --> 39:52.131
- AND IF SHE SAYS NO?

39:52.250 --> 39:56.107
- IN THE HIGHLY UNLIKELY
SITUATION THAT SHE SAYS NO,

39:56.220 --> 39:58.529
YOU SAY, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MAYBE NEXT TIME."

39:58.630 --> 40:00.279
AND YOU WALK AWAY.

40:00.390 --> 40:01.948
- AND IF SHE SAYS YES?

40:04.430 --> 40:06.773
- CAN I SHOW YOU?

40:06.880 --> 40:09.440
I'M PRETTY GOOD.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.917
I HAVEN'T DONE IT
IN A WHILE, BUT...

40:12.030 --> 40:12.815
I'VE GOT SOME MOVES,

40:12.920 --> 40:17.198
YOU KNOW,
FROM BACK IN THE DAY.

40:19.030 --> 40:22.033
[soft music plays]

40:22.140 --> 40:24.028
[sighs happily]

40:27.280 --> 40:29.623
OKAY.
YOU READY?

40:29.730 --> 40:31.243
YOU WALK UP TO A GIRL.

40:31.350 --> 40:32.829
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?"

40:32.940 --> 40:35.977
TRY THAT.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.498
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?

40:40.610 --> 40:43.124
- I WOULD LOVE TO DANCE.

40:43.230 --> 40:45.949
LII-T UP THIS ARM, OKAY?

40:46.060 --> 40:47.573
ON THE SHOULDER.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.409
THERE YOU GO.
RELAX A LITTLE.

40:49.510 --> 40:51.330
OKAY?

40:51.440 --> 40:52.577
THIS ARM OUT.

40:52.690 --> 40:55.989
AND YOU JUST
LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, OKAY?

40:56.100 --> 40:57.681
AND AS YOU'RE LISTENING
TO THE MUSIC,

40:57.800 --> 40:59.449
JUST LET YOUR FEET MOVE.

41:01.940 --> 41:04.340
THERE YOU GO.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.109
OKAY?

41:06.220 --> 41:08.939
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

41:09.050 --> 41:10.631
GOOD?
- MM-HMM.

41:13.470 --> 41:14.801
- [chuckles]

41:19.230 --> 41:22.950
AND SMILE A LITTLE.
