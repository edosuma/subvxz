 WHOO-HOO!

00:35.999 --> 00:37.000
 TO SAY THAT THIS IS A

00:37.000 --> 00:38.999

00:37.000 --> 00:38.999
UNDERSTATEMENT.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
 BUT THERE WERE DEALS I WALKED

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
 YOU'RE A THIEF AND A LIAR AND

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999

01:32.999 --> 01:35.999
BUSINESS THIS WAY.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.999
SO FAILURE ISN'T AN OPTION.

01:35.999 --> 01:37.999
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BANK

01:35.999 --> 01:37.999
COULD LITERALLY SHOW UP HERE

01:37.999 --> 01:41.999
TODAY AND LOCK THE DOORS?

01:37.999 --> 01:41.999
I ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING.

01:45.999 --> 01:48.999
 WHY CAN'T I FIX THIS?

01:48.999 --> 01:50.000

 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

 TONY, COME INTO MY OFFICE,

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
PLEASE.

03:09.999 --> 03:12.999
 AND TONY HAS BEEN TALKING

03:09.999 --> 03:12.999
ABOUT LEAVING ATHANS.

03:12.999 --> 03:15.999
 I CAN'T WORK IN AN

03:12.999 --> 03:15.999
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE OWNER

QUESTIONS EVERY SINGLE THING YOU

03:15.999 --> 03:18.999

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
 I REPEATED MYSELF THREE

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
TIMES.

03:20.999 --> 03:25.999
YOU DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.

03:20.999 --> 03:25.999
 WITH NO CARS ON THE LOT, AND

03:25.999 --> 03:29.999
NO PROCESS IN PLACE, ATHANS

03:25.999 --> 03:29.999
MOTORS HAS BEEN LOSING OVER

03:29.999 --> 03:32.999
$1.8 MILLION A YEAR.

03:29.999 --> 03:32.999

03:32.999 --> 03:35.999
DAYS, ATHANS MOTORS WILL BE

03:35.999 --> 03:38.999
FOREVER, AND PETE WILL LOSE HIS

03:35.999 --> 03:38.999
ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.

03:38.999 --> 03:45.999
 IF I CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN,

03:40.999 --> 03:45.999
IT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

03:42.999 --> 03:45.999
I'M SO MAD AT MYSELF.

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
 I'VE JUST ARRIVED AT ATHANS

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
MOTORS, AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

03:57.999 --> 04:00.999
IF THIS PLACE IS EVEN OPEN.

03:57.999 --> 04:00.999
WHERE ARE ALL THE CARS?

04:00.999 --> 04:03.999
WHAT THEY DO HAVE IS ALL SUPER

04:00.999 --> 04:03.999
HIGH-END.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
IN A GOOD USED CAR DEALERSHIP

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
CARS.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
THEY'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT

04:07.999 --> 04:10.999
THE MARKET REALLY CALLS FOR.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.999
THEY COULD BE $30,000 OVER, PER

04:10.999 --> 04:16.999
CAR, WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SHOULD

04:10.999 --> 04:16.999
BE CARRYING.

04:16.999 --> 04:19.999
WOW. LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

04:16.999 --> 04:19.999
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED IN THE

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
SHOWROOM IS I FEEL LIKE I'VE

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
JUST ENTERED CAESAR'S PALACE.

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
CLOUDS PAINTED ON THE CEILING, I

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
SEE MURALS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.999
I'M WAITING FOR ZEUS TO POP OUT.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.999
THERE ARE NO CUSTOMERS AROUND,

04:27.999 --> 04:30.999
AND MUCH LIKE THE LOT OUTSIDE,

04:27.999 --> 04:30.999
THE ONLY THING I SEE ARE A FEW

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
VINTAGE LUXURY VEHICLES IN THE

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
SHOWROOM.

04:33.999 --> 04:34.999
HOW YOU DOING? I'M MARCUS.

04:33.999 --> 04:34.999
 LARRY.

04:34.999 --> 04:35.999
NICE TO MEET YOU. PLEASURE.

04:34.999 --> 04:35.999
 NICE TO MEET YOU, LARRY.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
 PLEASURE.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
 IS THIS CAR FOR SALE?

04:37.999 --> 04:39.999
 YES, IT IS.

04:38.999 --> 04:39.999

04:39.999 --> 04:42.999
 2,400.

04:39.999 --> 04:42.999
IT WAS RESTORED.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.999
 UH-HUH.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.999
HOW MANY TOTAL CARS ON THE LOT?

04:45.999 --> 04:48.999
 PROBABLY 20.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.999
 TOTAL?

04:48.999 --> 04:51.999
 TOTAL.

04:48.999 --> 04:51.999
 20 CARS?

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
20 CARS IS MORE LIKE A PRIVATE

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
COLLECTION THAN A USED CAR

04:53.999 --> 04:56.999
DEALERSHIP.

04:53.999 --> 04:56.999
A SUCCESSFUL USED CAR DEALERSHIP

04:56.999 --> 04:59.999
IS ONE THAT IS BUILT ON HAVING

04:56.999 --> 04:59.999
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.

04:59.999 --> 05:05.999
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF

05:00.999 --> 05:05.999

05:46.999 --> 05:50.999
 CLOSE TO 100,000. 80,000.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
 [chuckles] OKAY.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
 I TRY TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
ONCE SO I DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
EVER AGAIN.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999

 OVER 2 MILLION.

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
 WOW.

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
 THE CEILING ALONE PROBABLY

06:01.999 --> 06:05.999

06:12.999 --> 06:15.999
BUILD OUT THIS WHOLE ROOM?

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
 CLOSE TO 1/2 MILLION.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
 COME ON.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
SO LIKE THAT GRANITE.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?

06:20.999 --> 06:24.999
 ABOUT 25,000, THE FOUR.

06:20.999 --> 06:24.999
 AND ALL THIS MOVIE STUFF, HOW

06:24.999 --> 06:27.999
MUCH IS THAT?

06:24.999 --> 06:27.999
 TVs ARE ABOUT 15,000, THE

06:27.999 --> 06:32.999
SEATS ARE 25,000, 30,000.

06:27.999 --> 06:32.999
 PETE, WHY?

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
HOW DOES ANY OF THIS HELP YOU

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
SELL CARS?

06:34.999 --> 06:37.999
 I MADE THIS STORE TO BE THE

06:34.999 --> 06:37.999
PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO HANG OUT

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
TO HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
EXPERIENCE ANYWHERE IN THE

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
UNITED STATES.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
 PETE, LOOK, CUSTOMERS DON'T

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
WANT TO HANG OUT.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
THEY WANT TO BUY CARS AT A FAIR

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
PRICE AND THEN THEY WANT TO GO

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
HOME.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
 WELL, I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
SEE.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.000
 SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I

06:47.999 --> 06:49.000
SEE.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.999
THIS COULD BE A CAR.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.999
THAT COULD BE A CAR.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
THOSE COULD BE A CAR.

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
 IF YOU LOOK AT IT YOUR WAY,

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
A LOT OF THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
CARS.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
 DO YOU EVER LOOK AT IT THAT

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
WAY?

06:59.999 --> 07:04.999
 UM...

06:59.999 --> 07:04.999
 PETE SPENT $100,000 ON WALL

07:04.999 --> 07:11.000
PLASTER, $15,000 IN MURALS, AND

07:04.999 --> 07:11.000
$500,000 IN HIS CUSTOMER LOUNGE.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.999
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A

07:11.000 --> 07:13.999
COLLEGE DEGREE TO KNOW THAT TO

07:13.999 --> 07:17.999
SPEND OVER $600,000 ON JUST

07:13.999 --> 07:17.999
THOSE ITEMS, I MEAN, IT'S JUST

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
IRRESPONSIBLE.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS.

07:19.999 --> 07:24.999
THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A USED CAR

07:19.999 --> 07:24.999
SOLD IN THIS MARKET IS $15,000.

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
THAT MEANS PETE COULD HAVE USED

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
THAT MONEY TO BUY AND SELL 40

07:27.999 --> 07:30.999
CARS.

07:27.999 --> 07:30.999
AT AN AVERAGE MARGIN OF $2,000

07:30.999 --> 07:36.999
PER CAR, HE WOULD'VE MADE

07:30.999 --> 07:36.999
$80,000 MORE IN A GIVEN MONTH.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.999
WHAT'D YOU PAY FOR THE BUILDING?

07:36.999 --> 07:39.999
 1.875 MILLION.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
 SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE UNDER

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
4 MILLION IN THE FACILITY.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
 YES.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
 HOW MUCH DEBT DO YOU HAVE ON

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
THE BUSINESS?

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
 ABOUT 6.9 MILLION.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.999
 I'M SORRY, HOW MUCH?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.999
 6.9 MILLION.

07:48.999 --> 07:54.999
5.3 MILLION IS MYSELF, MY MONEY,

07:48.999 --> 07:54.999
AND THE REST IS JUST FRIENDS AND

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
FAMILY.

07:54.999 --> 07:55.999
 WHERE'S THE MONEY?

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
 HOLDING THE LOSSES.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
KEEP THIS PLACE GOING.

07:58.999 --> 08:02.999
I'M LOSING OVER $100,000 A

07:58.999 --> 08:02.999
MONTH FOR ALMOST 2 1/2 YEARS.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
 THIS IS A BAD SCENARIO.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
IT SOUNDS LIKE PETE HAS BEEN

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
FINANCING HIS FAILED BUSINESS

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
OUT OF HIS POCKET FOR THE LAST

08:07.999 --> 08:11.999
2 1/2 YEARS, AND IT'S BEEN

08:07.999 --> 08:11.999
OPERATING IN THE RED THE ENTIRE

08:11.999 --> 08:12.999
TIME.

08:13.999 --> 08:14.999
THESE FINANCIALS.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
 HERE'S ERIKA.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
 HI.

08:16.999 --> 08:16.999
 HI.

08:17.999 --> 08:18.999
 I'M ERIKA.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
 HOW ARE YOU?

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
 GOOD. NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
 ARE YOU ACCOUNTING?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
 I'M THE OPERATIONS MANAGER

08:21.999 --> 08:24.999
HERE, SO I DO ALL THE

08:21.999 --> 08:24.999
ACCOUNTING, ALL THE FINANCE.

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
 DO YOU HAVE A FINANCIAL

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
STATEMENT FOR LAST MONTH?

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
 UM, THE BOOKS ARE IN YOUR

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
OFFICE.

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
 SURE. I'LL GET IT.

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
 I COULD PRINT YOU ONE, I

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
THINK.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
 YOU DO THE BOOKS BUT YOU'RE

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP 'EM.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
 EVERYTHING STAYS IN PETE'S

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
OFFICE.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
 BUT NOT BECAUSE SHE CAN'T GET

08:36.999 --> 08:40.999
IT, IT JUST STAYS IN MY OFFICE.

08:36.999 --> 08:40.999
 I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
A BUSINESS WHERE THE ACCOUNTANT

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
BOOKS.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
PETE NEEDS TO GIVE ERIKA THE

08:44.999 --> 08:48.999
TOOLS TO DO HER JOB AND NOT HIDE

08:44.999 --> 08:48.999
THEM IN HIS OFFICE.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.999
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE LOSING $150,000

08:48.999 --> 08:51.999
A MONTH, YOU'RE SELLING TEN

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
CARS.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
YOU'RE 50 CARS SHORT FROM

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
BREAKING EVEN.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE

08:55.999 --> 08:59.999
$150,000 IN MONTHLY LOSSES,

08:55.999 --> 08:59.999
ATHANS WOULD HAVE TO SELL 60

08:59.999 --> 09:04.999
CARS AT $2,500 PROFIT PER CAR.

08:59.999 --> 09:04.999
IN ORDER TO SELL 60 CARS, YOU

09:04.999 --> 09:07.999
NEED AT LEAST 120 ON THE GROUND.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.999
TODAY YOU HAVE 20.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999
YOU'RE 100 CARS SHORT.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999
SINCE THE AVERAGE USED CAR SOLD

09:10.999 --> 09:14.999
IN THIS AREA IS AROUND $15,000,

09:10.999 --> 09:14.999
BUYING THE NECESSARY INVENTORY

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
IS GONNA COST ATHANS AROUND

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
1.5 MILLION.

09:17.999 --> 09:21.999
YOU NEED $1 1/2 MILLION OF

09:17.999 --> 09:21.999
WORKING CAPITAL JUST TO HAVE

09:21.999 --> 09:24.999
ENOUGH CARS TO BE ABLE TO SELL

09:21.999 --> 09:24.999
CARS TO BREAK EVEN.

09:24.999 --> 09:28.999
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S A REAL

09:24.999 --> 09:28.999
CHALLENGE.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE IN

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
THE ACCOUNT TODAY?

09:30.999 --> 09:32.000
 PETE?

09:30.999 --> 09:32.000
 WHY DO YOU--WHY ARE YOU

09:32.000 --> 09:33.999
LOOKING AT HIM?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.999
 BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HANDLE

09:33.999 --> 09:37.999
EVERYTHING IN THE END ANYWAY, SO

09:33.999 --> 09:37.999
IT'S KINDA--GOES BACK TO HIM.

09:37.999 --> 09:45.999
 BETWEEN 20,000 AND 30,000.

09:41.999 --> 09:45.999
 THANKS, ERIKA.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
 YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
 PETE'S COUSIN TONY HAS BEEN

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
THE GENERAL MANAGER OF ATHANS

09:51.999 --> 09:54.999
SINCE THEY OPENED, AND I WANT TO

09:51.999 --> 09:54.999
GET HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
BUSINESS.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
ARE YOU TONY?

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
 YES, I AM.

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
 HOW YOU DOING? I'M MARCUS.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
 IT'S A PLEASURE.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
 NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
 VERY NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

09:59.999 --> 10:00.999
 SO YOU'RE THE MANAGER.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
 I WEAR ALL THE HATS.

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
 YOU WEAR ALL THE HATS. OKAY.

10:03.999 --> 10:08.999
 I HAVE BEEN IN THE CAR

10:03.999 --> 10:08.999
BUSINESS ABOUT 18 YEARS.

10:08.999 --> 10:09.999
EXCUSE ME, MARCUS.

10:11.000 --> 10:11.999
 HI, HOW ARE YOU?

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
 WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU TODAY?

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
 I AM ACTUALLY IN THE MARKET

10:14.999 --> 10:16.999
FOR AN SUV.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.999
 LIKE A BMW, MERCEDES,

10:16.999 --> 10:18.999
PORSCHE?

10:16.999 --> 10:18.999
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
 I'M KIND OF LOOKING FOR

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE

10:20.999 --> 10:21.999
MODEST.

10:20.999 --> 10:21.999
 OKAY.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
 FORD, CHEVY, MAYBE.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
 THE FIRST POTENTIAL BUYER

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
I'VE SEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
WALKS IN AND HE'S LOOKING TO BUY

10:25.999 --> 10:28.999
AN SUV.

10:25.999 --> 10:28.999
HE SEEMS MOTIVATED, EXCITED,

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
READY TO BUY.

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE

10:30.999 --> 10:32.999
WHAT HE WANTS.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.999
 I WISH WE COULD HELP YOU.

10:32.999 --> 10:33.999
 NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:32.999 --> 10:33.999
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
 MAYBE NEXT TIME.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
 TAKE CARE.

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
 HE WANTS TO BE IN AN

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
AFFORDABLE CAR LIKE EVERYBODY

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
ELSE IN AMERICA.

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
EVERY SUV WE HAVE ON THE LOT IS

10:39.999 --> 10:42.999
PRICED OVER $40,000.

10:39.999 --> 10:42.999
 THAT'S THE FRUSTRATING THING

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
THAT YOU DEAL WITH.

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
 HOW MANY CUSTOMERS A DAY DO

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
YOU GET THAT YOU CAN'T SELL

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
STUFF TO?

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
 OH, WE--IT'S NOT JUST THE

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
WALK-IN CUSTOMERS, IT'S THE

10:49.999 --> 10:53.999
PHONE CALLS.

10:49.999 --> 10:53.999
 YEAH.

10:50.999 --> 10:53.999
 IT'S THE INTERNET.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
 SEEMS BUSY.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
SERVICE SEEMS BUSY.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
 YEAH, SERVICE DOES, LIKE,

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
$100,000 PER MONTH.

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
SOMETIMES WE DO A LITTLE BIT

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
MORE.

11:01.999 --> 11:04.000
 SO IN YOUR ROLE AS GENERAL

11:01.999 --> 11:04.000
MANAGER, HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU

11:04.000 --> 11:07.999
SPEND OUT HERE?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.999
 I'M BACK HERE QUITE OFTEN.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
 THOSE GUYS ALL REPORTING TO

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
YOU?

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
 YES AND NO, OKAY.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
I TALK TO THEM ABOUT DAILY

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
OPERATIONS, BUT TECHNICALLY I

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
DON'T REALLY HAVE AUTHORITY OVER

11:14.999 --> 11:19.999
ANY DEPARTMENT.

11:14.999 --> 11:19.999
PETE WANTS HIS FINGER ON EVERY

11:19.999 --> 11:23.999
SINGLE THING IN THE STORE.

11:19.999 --> 11:23.999
HE MICROMANAGES.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.999
HE'S A VERY PROUD GUY, AND HE'S

11:23.999 --> 11:26.999
A GOOD GUY.

11:26.999 --> 11:29.999
WE JUST DON'T AGREE ON A LOT OF

11:26.999 --> 11:29.999
THINGS.

11:29.999 --> 11:32.000
EVEN THE BUYING OF THE CARS.

11:29.999 --> 11:32.000
WE HAVE "X" AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
SPEND, HE WANTS TO SPEND MONEY

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
ON A $100,000 PORSCHE.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.999
AND I'M LIKE, IT DOESN'T MAKE

11:36.000 --> 11:38.999
ANY SENSE.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.999
WHEN YOU HAVE $100,000 TO SPEND,

11:38.999 --> 11:42.999
IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO BUY

11:42.999 --> 11:46.999
$10,000, $15,000 CARS THAT THE

11:42.999 --> 11:46.999
AVERAGE WORKING CLASS IS LOOKING

11:46.999 --> 11:49.000
FOR.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.000
 TONY SEEMS TO BE ON THE BALL.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.999
HE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT HE'S

11:49.000 --> 11:50.999
DOING.

11:50.999 --> 11:53.999
AND IF PETE WOULD LET TONY DO

11:50.999 --> 11:53.999
HIS JOB--THIS GUY'S GOT TONS OF

11:53.999 --> 11:56.000
CAR EXPERIENCE--THEY MAY NOT BE

11:53.999 --> 11:56.000
IN THIS MESS.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.999
HE SAYS, "I'M WRITING THE

11:56.000 --> 11:59.999
CHECKS, I'M WRITING THE MONEY,

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA BUY."

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
 AND LOOK WHAT'S OUTSIDE.

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
NO CARS.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
YOU'RE NOT SELLING ANYTHING.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.999
AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
STRAINED.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.999
 ATHANS MOTORS IS IN A LOT OF

12:11.999 --> 12:14.999
TROUBLE.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
THEY'RE BURIED IN DEBT, THEY

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
DON'T HAVE ANY CARS ON THE

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
GROUND, AND THERE ARE NO

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
CUSTOMERS.

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
BUT I KNOW THE CAR BUSINESS, AND

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
THIS IS A GOOD LOCATION.

12:22.999 --> 12:25.999
THE FACILITY, WHILE OVERBUILT,

12:22.999 --> 12:25.999
COULD BE PERFECT WITH SOME

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
RENOVATIONS.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU

12:27.999 --> 12:30.999
UNDERSTAND THAT I TAKE

12:27.999 --> 12:30.999
RELATIONSHIPS AND BUSINESS VERY

12:30.999 --> 12:34.999
SERIOUSLY.

12:30.999 --> 12:34.999
YOU'RE ALMOST 7 MILLION IN DEBT,

12:34.999 --> 12:38.999
YOU'RE LOSING $150,000 A MONTH.

12:34.999 --> 12:38.999
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY, PETE.

12:38.999 --> 12:42.999
AND YOU HAVE ALMOST NO CASH.

12:38.999 --> 12:42.999
WHAT DO YOU STAND TO LOSE IF

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
THIS BUSINESS CLOSES?

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
 I WOULD LOSE MY HOUSE, MY

12:45.999 --> 12:49.999
DREAM, IT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.999
 STAKES ARE HUGE.

12:49.999 --> 12:55.999
 24/7, I THOUGHT ABOUT, EVERY

12:49.999 --> 12:55.999
SECOND, OF FIXING THIS PROBLEM.

12:55.999 --> 12:59.999
BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T WORK...

12:55.999 --> 12:59.999
NOT JUST THE EMPLOYEES HERE AND

12:59.999 --> 13:05.999
EVERYBODY ELSE, MY WIFE DIDN'T

12:59.999 --> 13:05.999
SIGN UP FOR THAT.

13:05.999 --> 13:10.999
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

13:05.999 --> 13:10.999
BUT...

13:10.999 --> 13:15.999
 RIGHT.

13:10.999 --> 13:15.999
 SO...

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
 WELL, THE STAKES ARE BIG FOR

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
ME TOO.

13:17.999 --> 13:22.999
I TAKE MONEY VERY SERIOUSLY.

13:17.999 --> 13:22.999
MY OFFER IS VERY SIMPLE.

13:22.999 --> 13:26.999
IT'S $3 1/2 MILLION TO HELP

13:22.999 --> 13:26.999
CLEAR THE DEBT, BRING IN NEW

13:26.999 --> 13:30.999
CARS FOR INVENTORY, AND

13:26.999 --> 13:30.999
ESSENTIALLY CHANGE ATHANS MOTORS

13:30.999 --> 13:33.999
INTO A BRAND-NEW BUSINESS THAT

13:30.999 --> 13:33.999
MAKES MONEY.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
AND YOU SHARE IN THE ECONOMICS.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
AND WE'LL BE 50/50 PARTNERS, BUT

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
I'M 100% IN CHARGE.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
'CAUSE I KNOW THIS BUSINESS

13:38.999 --> 13:42.999
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

13:38.999 --> 13:42.999
THERE'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
ABOUT IT.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
SO ALL THE WORK THAT I DO AND

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
ALL THE INVENTORY AND THE

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
PROCESS THAT I PUT IN, YOU'LL

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
SHARE IN IT.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
I GET MY 3 1/2 MILLION BACK

13:48.999 --> 13:52.999
FIRST, AND WE'LL STAY 50/50 ONCE

13:48.999 --> 13:52.999
IT'S PAID BACK.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.999
WHILE $3.5 MILLION IS A LOT OF

13:52.999 --> 13:56.999
MONEY, ONE WAY THAT I PROTECT

13:56.999 --> 13:59.999
MYSELF IS BY OWNING ALL OF THE

13:56.999 --> 13:59.999
NEW INVENTORY.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
AND SO MY RISK IS MINIMIZED.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
IT'S MINIMIZED BECAUSE I CAN

14:02.999 --> 14:05.999
LIQUIDATE THE CARS AND GET MY

14:02.999 --> 14:05.999
MONEY BACK.

14:05.999 --> 14:10.999
 I'M JUST--I'M A LITTLE

14:05.999 --> 14:10.999
CONCERNED WHEN YOU SAY 100% YOU

14:10.999 --> 14:14.999
RUN THE BUSINESS, BECAUSE I

14:10.999 --> 14:14.999
BELIEVE I HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
HERE.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
 WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT IT?

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
YOU HAVE A USED CAR LOT WITH NO

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
INVENTORY.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.999
 THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.999
 BUT, PETE, IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
MY OPINION THAT YOU'RE IN

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
TROUBLE, IT'S THE FACTS.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
 WELL, THAT'S--BUT THAT'S--

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
 STOP SAYING OPINION, IT'S--

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
WE'RE HERE.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
IN THE FOUR YEARS YOU'VE BEEN

14:28.999 --> 14:33.999
OPEN, YOU'VE LOST $4 MILLION.

14:28.999 --> 14:33.999
THERE'S 20 EMPLOYEES THAT WORK

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
HERE.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT OF JOBS.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
 BUT WHAT I HAVE SET UP IS

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
INFRASTRUCTURE--

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
 BUT IT ISN'T JUST THAT,

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
IT'S--THERE'S NO PROCESS IN

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
PLACE.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
 I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
YOU HAVE, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
RIGHT RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY RUN

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
THE BUSINESS THE RIGHT WAY

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
OVERNIGHT.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
 I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
 I...

14:51.999 --> 14:53.999
 THERE'S NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT

14:51.999 --> 14:53.999
THIS BUSINESS.

14:53.999 --> 14:56.999
SORRY.

14:53.999 --> 14:56.999
 I-I BELIEVE I--

14:56.999 --> 14:59.999
 THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

14:56.999 --> 14:59.999
YOU SPEND $4 MILLION, IT'S GONE.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
THERE'S NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
IT.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
 YOU'RE LOOK--

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
 YOU HAVE NO INVENTORY.

15:02.999 --> 15:06.000
IT'S GONE.

15:02.999 --> 15:06.000
 AND WILL I BE ABLE TO KEEP

15:06.000 --> 15:08.999
THE NAME?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.999
 KEEP WHAT NAME?

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
 ATHANS MOTORS.

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
 IS THE NAME IMPORTANT TO YOU?

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
 YES.

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
 I THOUGHT KEEPING THE PLACE

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
OPEN WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
 IT'S MY NAME.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
I MEAN, THAT MEANS A LOT.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
 IT'S ABOUT MARKETING AND

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
GETTING CUSTOMERS THROUGH

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
THE FRONT DOOR.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
IT'S NOT ABOUT PUTTING YOUR NAME

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
ON THE BUILDING.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
YOU GOTTA PUT YOUR PRIDE AWAY

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
FOR A MINUTE.

15:22.999 --> 15:26.999
 YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT ONLY ON

15:22.999 --> 15:26.999
YOUR END AS AN INVESTOR, AS A

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
PARTNER--

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
 THE ONLY WAY THIS BUSINESS

15:28.999 --> 15:34.000
WORKS IS IF SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS

15:28.999 --> 15:34.000
THE BUSINESS BETTER THAN YOU IS

15:34.000 --> 15:37.999
DRIVING THE PROCESS.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.999
DOESN'T WORK ANY OTHER WAY.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
 I THINK I'M UNSTOPPABLE.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
 PETE, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT

15:39.999 --> 15:42.999
YOUR PRIDE AWAY, THEN I'M NOT

15:39.999 --> 15:42.999
GONNA DO THE DEAL.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
 YOU DON'T NEED TO RAISE YOUR

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
VOICE AT ME.

15:44.999 --> 15:45.999
 WELL, I'M RAISING MY VOICE

15:46.999 --> 15:50.999
SAME THING AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

15:57.999 --> 16:02.999
 ARE YOU OKAY?

15:57.999 --> 16:02.999
 END IT.

16:02.999 --> 16:03.999
 COMING UP...

16:02.999 --> 16:03.999
DO YOU TRUST TONY?

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
 NO. THIS IS MY MONEY.

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M GONNA

16:05.999 --> 16:08.999
MICROMANAGE EVERYBODY.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.999
I'M NOT CHANGING.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
 AND LATER...

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
PETE, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
I DIDN'T AGREE TO ALL THESE

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
CHANGES.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
NOW YOU'RE JUST GONNA CHANGE

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
EVERYTHING.

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
THIS IS GONNA BE A DICTATORSHIP,

16:15.999 --> 16:15.999
THIS AIN'T GONNA BE NO

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
I DIDN'T AGREE TO THIS [bleep].

16:17.999 --> 16:18.999
THE DEAL'S OFF.

16:22.999 --> 16:24.999
 PETE, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT

16:22.999 --> 16:24.999
YOUR PRIDE AWAY, THEN I'M NOT

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
GONNA DO THE DEAL.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
 YOU DON'T NEED TO RAISE YOUR

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
VOICE AT ME.

17:03.999 --> 17:06.999
TO BRING IN NEW ASSETS AND SOME

17:03.999 --> 17:06.999
FRESH INVENTORY.

 I WILL BE WORKING FOR FREE

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
 YES.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
 I'M WRITING A CHECK FOR

17:23.999 --> 17:27.999
$3 1/2 MILLION.

17:23.999 --> 17:27.999
 MAYBE FOR THE FIRST TIME I'LL

HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
 WITH THIS CHECK, YOU KNOW

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
THAT I'M 100% IN CHARGE.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
 CORRECT.

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
 WE HAVE A DEAL?

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
 WE HAVE A DEAL.

17:35.999 --> 17:41.999
 OKAY.

17:35.999 --> 17:41.999
 THANK YOU.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
EVERYBODY MEET IN THE SHOWROOM,

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
PLEASE.

17:43.999 --> 17:47.999
EVERYBODY MEET IN THE SHOWROOM.

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
 GOOD MORNING.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
SO THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
IS THAT PETE AND I HAVE MADE A

17:49.999 --> 17:52.999
DEAL.

17:54.999 --> 17:55.999
CAPITAL.

17:55.999 --> 17:59.999
IT'S LOSING $150,000 A MONTH.

17:55.999 --> 17:59.999
WE WILL NOT BE LOSING MONEY

17:59.999 --> 18:02.999
ANYMORE.

17:59.999 --> 18:02.999
PETE AND I ARE GONNA BE 50/50

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
PARTNERS.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
BUT THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE

18:04.999 --> 18:09.999
DRAMATICALLY.

18:04.999 --> 18:09.999
GOING FORWARD, I AM 100% IN

18:09.999 --> 18:12.999
CHARGE.

18:09.999 --> 18:12.999
GONNA FOCUS ON THREE THINGS:

18:12.999 --> 18:16.999
PEOPLE, PROCESS, AND PRODUCT.

18:12.999 --> 18:16.999
IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCT, IT'S

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
SIMPLE.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
I MEAN, IT'S A CAR.

18:18.999 --> 18:22.999
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

18:18.999 --> 18:22.999
THERE'S 20 CARS OUTSIDE.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
AND WHATEVER CARS WE HAVE

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
OUTSIDE THAT DON'T WORK WE'RE

18:25.999 --> 18:29.999
GONNA LIQUIDATE.

18:25.999 --> 18:29.999
IN THE PAST WE'VE MADE SPENDING

18:29.999 --> 18:32.999
DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT WITH A

18:29.999 --> 18:32.999
LOT OF THOUGHT.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE BUYING FANCY

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
THINGS.

18:34.999 --> 18:37.999
VIDEO GAMES AND MOVIE SCREENS

18:34.999 --> 18:37.999
DON'T SELL CARS.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
I'M GONNA LIQUIDATE THAT STUFF

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
AND TRANSFORM THIS PLACE SO THAT

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
EVERY SQUARE INCH GENERATES

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
REVENUE.

18:42.999 --> 18:47.999
NEXT, WE'RE GONNA DRAMATICALLY

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
CHANGE THE MARKETING PLAN.

18:47.999 --> 18:48.999
BECAUSE ONCE WE HAVE CARS TO

18:49.999 --> 18:50.000
OUT.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
WE'RE GONNA SHOW THIS COMMUNITY

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
THAT WE'RE NO LONGER A HIGH-END

18:52.999 --> 18:55.999
DEALERSHIP WITH NO INVENTORY.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.999
WE WILL CATER TO EVERYBODY.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.999
WE'RE GONNA PUT ON A GRAND

18:55.999 --> 18:58.999
RE-OPENING EVENT, INVITE THE

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
WHOLE CITY, HAVE THEM COME DOWN,

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
CHECK US OUT, AND HOPEFULLY

19:00.999 --> 19:03.999
THEY'LL BUY SOME CARS.

19:00.999 --> 19:03.999
THE LAST THING, AND I THINK THE

19:03.999 --> 19:06.999
HARDEST FOR PETE, IS THAT GOING

19:03.999 --> 19:06.999
FORWARD...

19:06.999 --> 19:12.999
TONY, PETE IS FINALLY GOING TO

19:06.999 --> 19:12.999
LET YOU DO YOUR JOB.

19:12.999 --> 19:14.000
RIGHT?

19:12.999 --> 19:14.000
 ABSOLUTELY.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.999
 AND WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.999
I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN

19:17.999 --> 19:20.999
TO MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL AND TO

19:17.999 --> 19:20.999
HELP YOU MAKE MORE MONEY.

19:20.999 --> 19:23.999
THAT'S MY JOB.

19:20.999 --> 19:23.999
[applause]

19:23.999 --> 19:29.999
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO WORK.

19:23.999 --> 19:29.999
HEY, PETE.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.999
CAN WE GO WALK THE INVENTORY?

19:29.999 --> 19:32.999
 SURE.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
 LET'S GRAB ERIKA AND TONY AS

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
WELL.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
I'M GONNA LIQUIDATE INVENTORY OF

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
CARS THAT AREN'T SELLING.

19:37.999 --> 19:40.999
AND I'M GONNA REINVEST THAT CASH

19:37.999 --> 19:40.999
INTO CARS THAT I KNOW WILL SELL.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.999
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE TO

19:40.999 --> 19:42.999
DO IN A BUSINESS LIKE THIS IS

19:42.999 --> 19:45.999
WALK THE INVENTORY EVERY MORNING

19:42.999 --> 19:45.999
AT THE START OF THE DAY.

19:45.999 --> 19:48.999
SO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A USED

19:45.999 --> 19:48.999
CAR SOLD AROUND HERE IS $15,000

19:48.999 --> 19:52.999
TO $30,000.

19:48.999 --> 19:52.999
HOW MUCH IS THIS PORSCHE?

19:52.999 --> 19:55.999
 76,000.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.999
 HOW MUCH IS THIS CAR?

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
 30.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
 HOW MUCH IS THAT CAR?

19:57.999 --> 20:00.999
 46.

19:57.999 --> 20:00.999
 WHERE'S ALL YOUR CARS UNDER

20:00.999 --> 20:04.999
30?

20:00.999 --> 20:04.999
IF YOU TOOK THIS MONEY AND

20:04.999 --> 20:08.999
DIDN'T HAVE $80,000 IN HERE, HOW

20:04.999 --> 20:08.999
MANY CARS CAN I HAVE ON THE LOT

20:08.999 --> 20:11.999
INSTEAD OF AN $80,000 PORSCHE?

20:08.999 --> 20:11.999
 THREE, FOUR, FIVE...

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
 ERIKA?

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
 SIX.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
 SIX?

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
 FIVE, SIX. DEPENDS.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
 BUT WHEN THE DEAL PRESENTS

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
ITSELF, THE RIGHT CAR THAT'S

20:16.999 --> 20:18.999
HARD TO FIND, FOR YOU TO TURN IT

20:16.999 --> 20:18.999
DOWN--IT WOULDN'T MAKE SEN--

20:18.999 --> 20:23.999
 BUT YOU SOLD 11 LAST MONTH.

20:18.999 --> 20:23.999
IN A PERFECT WORLD, PETE, IF WE

20:23.999 --> 20:26.999
HAD 150 CARS ON THE GROUND AND

20:23.999 --> 20:26.999
WE WERE MAKING 100,000 OR

20:26.999 --> 20:30.999
200,000 A MONTH, I WOULD BUY

20:26.999 --> 20:30.999
THIS CAR ALL DAY LONG.

20:30.999 --> 20:34.000
THE CHALLENGE IS BECAUSE THE

20:30.999 --> 20:34.000
MARKET IS SO NARROW WE GOTTA BE

20:34.000 --> 20:36.999
VERY CAREFUL ON THE TYPE OF CARS

20:34.000 --> 20:36.999
WE BUY AND THE TYPE OF CARS WE

20:36.999 --> 20:42.999
PUT OUR CASH INTO.

20:38.999 --> 20:42.999
IF THIS DOESN'T SELL, YOU'VE

20:39.999 --> 20:42.999
LOST $80,000.

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
CARS?

20:48.999 --> 20:51.999
 I AM RESPONSIBLE TO AN

20:48.999 --> 20:51.999
EXTENT.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
 SO DID YOU BUY ALL THESE

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
CARS?

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
 NO.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
 I WAS BUYING.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
 PETE IS SO COMMITTED TO

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
PROVING THAT HIS WAY IS THE

20:57.999 --> 21:00.000
RIGHT WAY THAT HE'S IGNORING

20:57.999 --> 21:00.000
PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE BUSINESS

21:00.000 --> 21:03.999
FAR BETTER THAN HE DOES.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.999
AND HE CONTINUES TO BURY HIMSELF

21:03.999 --> 21:07.999
IN DEBT AND BAD DECISIONS.

21:03.999 --> 21:07.999
IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

21:07.999 --> 21:11.999
MARKET REALLY IS, AND WE DON'T

21:07.999 --> 21:11.999
PRICE PROPERLY BASED ON THE AGE

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
OF THE CAR, THEN EVERYTHING WE

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
HAVE ON THE LOT'S GONNA BE FULL

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
OF WATER.

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
AND WHEN IT GETS PAST 60 DAYS,

21:15.999 --> 21:18.999
IT'S JUST DEPRECIATING.

21:15.999 --> 21:18.999
THIS IS CASH THAT'S JUST--IT'S

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
MELTING DOWN ON US.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
THEY GOTTA GO.

21:20.999 --> 21:23.999
CAN YOU POINT OUT TO ME THE CARS

21:20.999 --> 21:23.999
THAT ARE OVER 60 DAYS OLD?

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
 THIS ONE.

21:25.999 --> 21:26.999
WHAT DO WE OWN IT FOR?

21:26.999 --> 21:30.999
 46.

21:26.999 --> 21:30.999
OH...

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
 GREAT. COME ON, GUYS.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
 WITH--

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
 I'M GONNA CLEAR THE CACHE.

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY.

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
 I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE TAKING A

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
BIG HIT.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
 HOW MUCH IS THIS CAR WORTH?

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
 32.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
 28.5.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
 OH...

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
 NEXT CAR.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.999
 CAN'T BUY THAT AT 28.5.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
 IT'S FIVE MONTHS OLD.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
THIS LEXUS.

21:44.999 --> 21:48.999
 33 AND CHANGE.

21:49.999 --> 21:49.999
NUMBERS?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.999
 I COULD ANSWER YOU.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.999
 LET HIM ANSWER.

21:51.999 --> 21:55.999
WHAT'S THE CAR WORTH?

21:51.999 --> 21:55.999
 48.

21:55.999 --> 21:59.000
WELL, I'LL STOP ANSWERING.

21:55.999 --> 21:59.000
 WHAT DO WE OWN IT FOR?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.999
 ABOUT $45,000.

22:01.999 --> 22:03.999
 LOW 40s.

22:03.999 --> 22:06.999
 38.5.

22:03.999 --> 22:06.999
 YOU'RE--YOU'RE DISCOUNTING

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
EASY THINGS THAT I CAN'T GO BUY

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
AT THE PRICE THAT YOU'RE SAYING.

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
 WELL, PETE, THEY'RE NOT WORTH

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
ANYTHING IF THEY DON'T SELL.

22:10.999 --> 22:13.000
THEY'RE JUST SITTING HERE.

22:10.999 --> 22:13.000
WHEN THEY'RE PAST 60 DAYS,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.999
THEY'RE GONNA GET LIQUIDATED.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.999
IF WE TAKE A LOSS, WE'RE GONNA

22:14.999 --> 22:17.000
LEARN OUR LESSON.

22:14.999 --> 22:17.000
THESE ARE THE WRONG CARS FOR

22:17.000 --> 22:19.999
THIS MARKET.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.999
TONY, THESE CARS BETTER BE GONE

22:19.999 --> 22:24.999
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

22:20.999 --> 22:24.999
YOU'RE THE GENERAL MANAGER.

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
I EXPECT IT TO BE DONE.

22:31.999 --> 22:36.999
 THIS IS A 2012 C-CLASS.

22:31.999 --> 22:36.999
SO TIRES, BRAKES, EVERYTHING'S

22:36.999 --> 22:39.999
BETTER THAN 50%.

22:36.999 --> 22:39.999
DID ALL THE FLUIDS ON THE CAR.

22:39.999 --> 22:41.999
 I'M IMPRESSED THAT I SEE TONY

22:39.999 --> 22:41.999
WASTING NO TIME BRINGING

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
WHOLESALERS IN TO LIQUIDATE

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
CARS.

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
WE WILL NO LONGER FOLLOW PETE'S

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
PLAN OF HAVING DEAD INVENTORY

22:46.999 --> 22:49.999
JUST SIT AROUND.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.999
WE'RE GONNA TURN THAT INTO CASH

22:49.999 --> 22:52.999
AND REINVEST IT INTO CARS THAT

22:49.999 --> 22:52.999
ACTUALLY SELL.

22:52.999 --> 22:57.999
 THE CAR SITTING HERE RIGHT

22:52.999 --> 22:57.999
NOW, BETTER THAN 34,000.

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
 THAT--IT'S NEVER GONNA DO

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
34,000.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
 I KNOW.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM FROM THE

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
START.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
 I THINK THE CAR IS SOMEWHERE

23:03.999 --> 23:07.999
IN THE 28 RANGE.

23:03.999 --> 23:07.999
 28.5, I'LL SELL THE CAR AND

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
IT'LL BE--IT'LL BE DONE WITH.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
 OKAY.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
 HEY.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
 TONY.

23:10.999 --> 23:12.999
 both: WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:10.999 --> 23:12.999
 THIS IS ANDREW.

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
 HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
 HI, ANDREW. NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
 I'M SELLING HIM THE CAR FOR

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
28 1/2.

23:15.999 --> 23:20.999
 I WON'T SELL IT AT THAT.

23:15.999 --> 23:20.999
CAR'S WORTH 30 ALL DAY,

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
WHOLESALE.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
 I THINK THAT IF I BRING IT TO

23:22.999 --> 23:26.999
THE AUCTION, IT DOES 27, 27.5,

23:22.999 --> 23:26.999
AND I THINK AT 28.5 I'M JUST

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO DO

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
BUSINESS HERE.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
 AND THIS WAS A FRONTLINE

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
READY CAR, SO...

23:30.999 --> 23:32.999
 I'M TAKING THAT INTO

23:31.000 --> 23:32.999
CONSIDERATION AT 28.5.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
 "FRONTLINE READY" MEANS THAT

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
THE CAR HAS GONE THROUGH A

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
SERIES OF INSPECTIONS AND HAS

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
BEEN CHECKED OUT FROM TOP TO

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
BOTTOM.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
THE CAR'S BEEN DETAILED AND IT'S

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
NOW READY FOR SALE TO THE

23:39.999 --> 23:40.999
CUSTOMER.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
 I CAN'T LET YOU MAKE A COUPLE

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
THOUSAND ON A WHOLESALE DEAL.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
 OKAY.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
 ANDREW, HOW ARE YOU?

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
 HI.

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
 THIS IS MARCUS.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
 HOW LONG HAVE WE HAD THIS

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
CAR?

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
 CLOSE TO SIX MONTHS.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
 I MEAN, THAT'S THE ISSUE.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
THE CAR'S NOT WORTH 34 GRAND.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
WHO BOUGHT THIS CAR?

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
 PETE BOUGHT IT ONLINE.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
 IT WAS A MISTAKE.

23:57.999 --> 24:00.999
 WELL, I STILL THINK 28.5 WAS

23:57.999 --> 24:00.999
TOO LOW.

24:00.999 --> 24:01.999
 LET'S YOU AND I TALK OVER

24:00.999 --> 24:01.999
HERE.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.999
SORRY, ANDREW.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.999
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH LETTING

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
TONY DO HIS JOB?

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

24:06.999 --> 24:10.999
 I FEEL I HAVE TO BE ON EVERY

24:06.999 --> 24:10.999
SINGLE DECISION BECAUSE THAT

24:10.999 --> 24:13.999
EXTRA 500, THAT EXTRA 2,000

24:10.999 --> 24:13.999
MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
 HE'S NOT GONNA HAVE YOU LOSE

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
MONEY BECAUSE HE THINKS IT'S FUN

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
OR 'CAUSE HE'S DISTRACTED.

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
 I JUST THINK PEOPLE LOOK AT

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN IT'S

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
YOUR MONEY AND NOT ANYBODY

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
ELSE'S.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
 HONESTLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
FROM WHAT I'M HEARING AND WHAT

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
I'M SEEING, I DON'T THINK YOU

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
CAN HELP YOURSELF BUT TO

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
MICROMANAGE EVERYTHING.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
 BUT I HAVEN'T.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
 I'M WATCHING YOU DO IT ALL

24:28.999 --> 24:29.999
OVER THE PLACE.

24:28.999 --> 24:29.999
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
 NO, IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
 THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
 DO YOU TRUST TONY?

24:32.999 --> 24:35.999
 NO.

24:32.999 --> 24:35.999
 WHY?

24:35.999 --> 24:38.999
 BECAUSE IT'S MY MONEY.

24:35.999 --> 24:38.999
HE LOSES NOTHING.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
SO IF THAT'S MICROMANAGING,

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, I'M

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
GONNA MICROMANAGE EVERYBODY.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
I'M NOT CHANGING.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
 IF YOU CUT SOMEBODY'S BALLS

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
OFF EVERY TIME THEY MAKE

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
A DECISION OR IN FRONT OF

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
SOMEBODY, HE DOES THE DEAL AND

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
THEN THE DEAL UNWINDS, IT'S A

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
PROBLEM.

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
THE REASON YOU'RE TAKING A

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
$5,000 LOSS IS 'CAUSE YOU BOUGHT

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
THE CAR WRONG.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
THAT'S THE REASON THERE'S A

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
LOSS.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
NOT BECAUSE HE MADE A MISTAKE ON

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
THE VALUE.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
CARS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT HERE

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
MORE THAN 60 DAYS HAVE TO GO.

25:01.999 --> 25:04.999
SO THIS CAR IS GOING, AND TONY

25:01.999 --> 25:04.999
MADE THE DEAL, AND YOU'RE NOT

25:04.999 --> 25:07.999
GONNA COME BEHIND EVERY SINGLE

25:04.999 --> 25:07.999
PERSON AND CHANGE THE DEAL.

25:07.999 --> 25:09.999
YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

25:07.999 --> 25:09.999
AND ANDREW, THE CAR IS SOLD AT

25:18.999 --> 25:23.999
I CAN'T WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT

25:20.000 --> 25:23.999

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

25:36.999 --> 25:40.999
EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THIS

25:36.999 --> 25:40.999

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
THESE CLASSIC CARS ARE ON

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
DON'T OWN 'EM, AND WE'RE NOT

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
GONNA MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ON

26:02.999 --> 26:05.999
TO DO HIS JOB AND BUY INVENTORY

26:05.999 --> 26:10.999
WITHOUT PETE INTERFERING.

26:05.999 --> 26:10.999
 ALL RIGHT.

26:10.999 --> 26:13.999
 TOO MANY MILES.

26:10.999 --> 26:13.999

26:26.999 --> 26:29.000
PETE LETTING TONY AND I MAKE

26:29.000 --> 26:31.999
DECISIONS, BUT I'LL GIVE HIM

26:29.000 --> 26:31.999
SOME CREDIT.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
HE'S STANDING BACK AND LETTING

26:36.999 --> 26:41.999
 OKAY.

26:41.999 --> 26:45.999
TODAY WE PICKED UP 28 USED CARS.

26:41.999 --> 26:45.999
WE MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR

26:45.999 --> 26:49.999
INVENTORY.

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
TAKE CARE.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.999
I'VE HIRED PAINTERS TO COME IN

26:49.999 --> 26:52.999
AND TAKE DOWN THESE MURALS AND

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
PAINT OVER THESE CLOUDS THAT

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
ADD NO VALUE TO SELLING CARS.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
WE'RE GONNA LIQUIDATE ALL THESE

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999

27:07.999 --> 27:10.999
I BROUGHT IN A CREW OF SEVERAL

27:07.999 --> 27:10.999

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999
LOUNGE INTO AN AUTO ACCESSORY

27:10.999 --> 27:13.999

27:13.999 --> 27:16.999
I'VE ALSO TAKEN WALLS DOWN TO

27:13.999 --> 27:16.999
CREATE A NICE CHECKOUT AREA AND

27:16.999 --> 27:19.999
IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER FLOW.

27:16.999 --> 27:19.999
JUST WANT THESE IN THE SHOWROOM?

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
THE LOUNGE CURRENTLY GENERATES

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
NO REVENUE PER SQUARE FOOT.

27:22.999 --> 27:25.999
IT ACTUALLY COSTS US MONEY.

27:22.999 --> 27:25.999
ONCE WE BRING IN THESE PARTS AND

27:25.999 --> 27:28.999
ACCESSORIES, WE'LL BE GENERATING

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
REVENUE AT EVERY SQUARE INCH.

27:28.999 --> 27:34.999
WE ACTUALLY WANT THIS LOUNGE

27:28.999 --> 27:34.999

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
 I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOOK MY

27:34.999 --> 27:36.999
LOUNGE AWAY.

27:36.999 --> 27:37.999
THIS WAS A STATE-OF-THE-ART

27:36.999 --> 27:37.999
LOUNGE.

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
 THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
SQUARE FOOTAGE NOT BEING USED.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
WE HAVE TO GENERATE MORE

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
REVENUE.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
WE CAN'T USE IT JUST TO HAVE

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
PEOPLE SIT AROUND AND WATCH

27:43.999 --> 27:50.999
MOVIES.

27:44.999 --> 27:50.999
DOESN'T WORK.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.999
UNBELIEVABLE.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
 JIM.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
WHY IS THIS CAR STILL SITTING

27:57.999 --> 28:01.999
HERE AFTER I SPECIFICALLY SAID

28:00.999 --> 28:01.999
I NEEDED IT DONE ASAP?

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
 PETE TOLD US TO STOP DOING

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
IT.

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN PETE?

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
GOD--ALL RIGHT.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
 I GOTTA LISTEN TO THE BOSS.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
 YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S FINE.

28:06.999 --> 28:15.999
I CAN'T WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT

28:08.999 --> 28:15.999
WHERE SOMEONE MICROMANAGES.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.999
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

28:21.999 --> 28:28.999
 WHAT'S GOING ON, TONY?

28:21.999 --> 28:28.999
 LISTEN, I DECIDED THAT I

28:28.999 --> 28:33.999
DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

28:28.999 --> 28:33.999
 WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
WHY?

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
 BECAUSE OUR [bleep]

28:34.999 --> 28:38.999
RELATIONSHIP WENT TO [bleep].

28:34.999 --> 28:38.999
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT

28:38.999 --> 28:42.999
HAPPEN NO MORE.

28:38.999 --> 28:42.999
I MADE MY DECISION--

28:42.999 --> 28:46.999
 NO.

28:42.999 --> 28:46.999
 THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY

28:46.999 --> 28:50.999
THAT'S EVER GONNA GET IN-BETWEEN

28:46.999 --> 28:50.999
ME AND MY FAMILY.

28:50.999 --> 28:57.999
AND YOU ARE MY FAMILY.

28:50.999 --> 28:57.999
IT WASN'T AN EASY DECISION.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
AND...

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
 YOU'RE NOT LEAVING, THOUGH.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
 I AM.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
 LISTEN, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

29:01.999 --> 29:07.999
 YOU AND MARCUS NEED TO

29:01.999 --> 29:07.999
CONTINUE WHAT YOU AND I STARTED.

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
HEAR ME OUT.

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
 NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
ANYWHERE.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
MARCUS, COME HERE, PLEASE.

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
MARCUS, COME HERE, PLEASE.

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
 LISTEN, NOBODY'S CHANGING MY

29:13.999 --> 29:16.999
MIND, OKAY?

29:13.999 --> 29:16.999
 YOU STAY HERE, YOU WILL BE

29:16.999 --> 29:20.999
RUNNING IT.

29:16.999 --> 29:20.999
WE'VE SET EVERYTHING UP TO

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
SUCCEED.

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
 I'M SURE YOU WILL, PETE.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
 LISTEN TO ME.

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
THEN IF YOU DECIDE IN A YEAR OR

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
TWO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE--

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
 DOESN'T MATTER.

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
 TONY--

29:28.999 --> 29:32.999
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.

29:28.999 --> 29:32.999
I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN THIS

29:32.999 --> 29:36.999
WORLD FOR YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

29:32.999 --> 29:36.999
 LISTEN, LISTEN--

29:36.999 --> 29:39.999
 NO.

29:36.999 --> 29:39.999
 SO WHAT'S GOING ON AGAIN?

29:39.999 --> 29:44.999
 HE WANTS TO LEAVE.

29:39.999 --> 29:44.999
HE FEELS THAT--NOT TO BE HERE.

29:44.999 --> 29:51.999
 WHY NOT, TONY?

29:44.999 --> 29:51.999
 I FEEL THAT, UM, RIGHT NOW

29:51.999 --> 29:56.999
HE HAS THE RIGHT PARTNER TO HELP

29:51.999 --> 29:56.999
HIM GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
 WELL, HE HAS THE RIGHT

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
FINANCIAL PARTNER, BUT I'M NOT

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
HERE EVERY DAY.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
 I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.000
AND, UH...

30:00.999 --> 30:02.000
 HAVE I EVER ASKED YOU FOR

30:02.000 --> 30:03.999
ANYTHING?

30:04.999 --> 30:09.999
PLAY THIS THROUGH.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
 MY DECISION IS MADE.

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
 COMING UP...

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
 WHY'D YOU TAKE MY NAME OFF?

30:25.999 --> 30:28.999
 I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

30:25.999 --> 30:28.999
EVERYBODY THAT CAME HERE BEFORE

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
KNOWS THIS IS A NEW DAY.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAME HERE

30:30.999 --> 30:32.999
BEFORE, THERE WAS NO CARS.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
THIS IS BULL[bleep].

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
MOVE.

30:47.999 --> 30:53.999
 WELL, TONY'S NOW GONE.

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:53.999 --> 30:58.999
 I JUST THINK IT'S SAD.

30:53.999 --> 30:58.999
I LOOK BACK THAT I DID A LOT OF

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
THINGS WRONG, AND IT'S MY FAULT

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
BECAUSE I MICROMANAGED HIM.

31:01.999 --> 31:04.999
I'M UPSET.

31:01.999 --> 31:04.999
 MICROMANAGING PEOPLE ISN'T

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
A GOOD THING.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
I MEAN, THIS IS A GUY THAT'S

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
25 YEARS, RIGHT?

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
EXPERIENCE, IN FACT YOU DON'T

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN THE AUTO

31:10.999 --> 31:12.999
BUSINESS.

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THIS

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
GRAND OPENING COMING AND WE

31:14.999 --> 31:17.999
DON'T HAVE REALLY ANYBODY ELSE

31:14.999 --> 31:17.999
THAT UNDERSTANDS THE AUTO

31:17.999 --> 31:21.999
BUSINESS IS A PROBLEM.

31:17.999 --> 31:21.999
SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND FILL THAT

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
ROLE OF APPRAISING AND KIND OF

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
WORKING ON DEALS WITH THE

31:24.999 --> 31:27.999
SALESPEOPLE, AND THEN I'LL FIND

31:24.999 --> 31:27.999
SOMEBODY ELSE TO FILL THAT ROLE,

31:27.999 --> 31:29.999
BUT WE ARE GONNA NEED SOMEBODY

31:27.999 --> 31:29.999
HERE ON A DAILY BASIS THAT

31:29.999 --> 31:33.999
UNDERSTANDS THE CAR BUSINESS.

31:29.999 --> 31:33.999
I CAN'T BE HERE EVERY DAY.

31:33.999 --> 31:36.999
TONY WAS NOT ONLY THE GENERAL

31:33.999 --> 31:36.999
MANAGER, BUT HE WAS THE ONE GUY

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
THAT ACTUALLY KNEW THE CAR

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
BUSINESS.

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
PETE'S MICROMANAGEMENT RAN HIM

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
OFF.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
AND IF PETE DOESN'T CHANGE HIS

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
WAYS, MORE PEOPLE WILL LEAVE.

31:43.999 --> 31:48.999
I HOPE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

31:43.999 --> 31:48.999
HIM CAN AT LEAST REPAIR ITSELF,

31:48.999 --> 31:51.999
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR

31:48.999 --> 31:51.999
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS

31:51.999 --> 31:51.999
STRAINED.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.999
REGARD.

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
 THANK YOU.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
 WE'RE A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
FROM THE GRAND OPENING, AND NOT

32:07.999 --> 32:10.999
ONLY AM I TRANSFORMING THE OLD

32:07.999 --> 32:10.999
BUSINESS, I'M CREATING A NEW

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999
ONE.

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999

32:13.999 --> 32:17.999
EXIST.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.999
WE WILL REOPEN AS AUTOMATCH USA.

32:17.999 --> 32:20.999
AT AUTOMATCH USA, WE'RE GONNA

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
 I LOVE IT.

32:27.999 --> 32:33.999
 YEAH, THANK YOU.

32:27.999 --> 32:33.999
 I DIDN'T AGREE TO THAT.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
WHY'D YOU TAKE MY NAME OFF?

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
 'CAUSE THAT'S THE NEW NAME OF

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
THE BUSINESS.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
 THAT'S BULL[bleep].

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
 SO IS IT ABOUT YOU SEEING

32:39.999 --> 32:42.999
YOUR NAME ON THE BUILDING, OR IS

32:39.999 --> 32:42.999
IT ABOUT SELLING CARS?

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
 MY NAME BROUGHT CUSTOMERS IN

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
THE DOOR 'CAUSE I HAVE A GREAT

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
NAME IN CHICAGO.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO I AM.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.000
THAT'S WHY THEY COME HERE.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.000
 REALLY?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.999
 REALLY.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.999
 YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT?

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
 I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IT.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
 UH-HUH.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
NOBODY GIVES A [bleep] ABOUT

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
YOUR NAME.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
 WHO GIVES A [bleep] ABOUT

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
YOUR NAME?

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
 I DON'T HAVE MY NAME

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
ON THE BUILDING.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
AUTOMATCH USA IS THE NEW NAME OF

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
THE BUSINESS, AND I NEED TO MAKE

32:59.999 --> 33:02.999
SURE THAT EVERYBODY THAT CAME

32:59.999 --> 33:02.999
HERE BEFORE KNOWS THIS IS A NEW

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
DAY.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAME HERE

33:04.999 --> 33:07.999
BEFORE THERE WAS NO CARS.

33:04.999 --> 33:07.999
NONE.

33:07.999 --> 33:08.999
 I DON'T HAVE CARS, BUT I HAVE

33:07.999 --> 33:08.999
A GOOD BUSINESS.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
 BUT YOU DON'T HAVE CARS!

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
THAT IS THE BUSINESS!

33:10.999 --> 33:11.999
 I'M DONE ARGUING WITH YOU!

33:12.999 --> 33:17.999
MOVE.

33:14.999 --> 33:17.999
[bleep] BULL[bleep].

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
 PETE, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

33:21.999 --> 33:23.999
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:23.999 --> 33:25.999
I DIDN'T AGREE TO ALL THESE

33:23.999 --> 33:25.999
CHANGES.

33:25.999 --> 33:26.999
NOW YOU'RE JUST GONNA CHANGE

33:25.999 --> 33:26.999
EVERYTHING.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
THIS IS GONNA BE A DICTATORSHIP,

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
THIS AIN'T GONNA BE NO

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
PARTNERSHIP.

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
 WELL, IT'S NOT A

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
DICTATORSHIP, 'CAUSE WHEN YOU

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
CALLED ME YOU ASKED ME TO COME

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
IN AND HELP YOU FIX THE

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
BUSINESS.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
THE THING THAT YOU DIDN'T SEEM

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
TO UNDERSTAND WAS THAT

33:34.999 --> 33:38.999
EVERYTHING HAD TO CHANGE.

33:34.999 --> 33:38.999
IT'S GOTTA BE A NEW BUSINESS.

33:38.999 --> 33:41.999
WHEN I GAVE YOU THE $3 1/2

33:38.999 --> 33:41.999
MILLION, IT WAS TO START A NEW

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
ENTITY.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
IT WASN'T TO JUST PICK AND

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
CHOOSE WHAT WAS GONNA CHANGE.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
WE NEEDED TO RELAUNCH THIS

33:46.999 --> 33:47.999
BRAND.

33:48.999 --> 33:51.999
I DIDN'T AGREE TO THIS [bleep].

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
THE DEAL'S OFF.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.999
 WE NEEDED TO RELAUNCH THIS

34:01.999 --> 34:04.999
BRAND.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.000
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:04.999 --> 34:06.000
I DIDN'T AGREE TO THIS [bleep].

34:06.000 --> 34:08.998
THE DEAL'S OFF.

34:07.999 --> 34:08.998
 NO, PETE, IT'S NOT OFF.

34:08.998 --> 34:11.998
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

34:08.998 --> 34:11.998
I'VE PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO

34:11.998 --> 34:13.998
THIS PLACE.

34:11.998 --> 34:13.998
AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE HAPPY.

34:13.998 --> 34:15.998
AND YOU'VE LIKED A LOT OF THE

34:13.998 --> 34:15.998
CHANGES.

34:15.998 --> 34:17.998
YOU KNOW YOU'VE LIKED A LOT OF

34:15.998 --> 34:17.998
THE CHANGES.

34:17.998 --> 34:19.998
BUT WHAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM

34:17.998 --> 34:19.998
HERE?

34:19.998 --> 34:21.998
 I DON'T LIKE YOU CHANGING THE

34:19.998 --> 34:21.998
NAME WITHOUT TELLING ME, 'CAUSE

34:21.998 --> 34:23.998
THAT TELLS ME YOU MIGHT BE ABLE

34:21.998 --> 34:23.998
TO CHANGE EVERYTHING DOWN THE

34:23.998 --> 34:24.998
ROAD.

34:23.998 --> 34:24.998
 THERE'S GONNA BE MORE

34:24.998 --> 34:26.998
CHANGES, PETE.

34:24.998 --> 34:26.998
THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF

34:26.998 --> 34:27.998
CHANGES.

34:26.998 --> 34:27.998
UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT, WE'RE

34:27.998 --> 34:30.998
GONNA MAKE CHANGES.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.998
 I SPENT 4 1/2 YEARS CREATING

34:30.998 --> 34:33.998
A BRAND, SPENDING MILLIONS OF

34:30.998 --> 34:33.998
DOLLARS TO HAVE A GREAT NAME ON

34:33.998 --> 34:36.998
THE STREET FOR CUSTOMERS, FOR

34:33.998 --> 34:36.998
EMPLOYEES, FOR EVERYTHING, AND

34:36.998 --> 34:38.998
YOU JUST CHANGED IT WITHOUT EVEN

34:36.998 --> 34:38.998
ASKING.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.998
 YOU'RE GETTING SO CAUGHT UP

34:38.998 --> 34:40.998
IN THE DETAILS THAT YOU'RE

34:40.998 --> 34:44.998
LETTING YOUR EMOTION OUTPLAY

34:40.998 --> 34:44.998
THE LOGIC OF THE BUSINESS.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
 BUT THIS SECOND IT HURTS, I'M

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.000
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, IT AIN'T

34:47.998 --> 34:50.000
GONNA HAVE ANYTHING OF ME AND

34:50.000 --> 34:52.998
THE BRAND I CREATED HERE.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.998
 I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOUR

34:52.998 --> 34:54.998
FRUSTRATION.

34:52.998 --> 34:54.998
I DO.

34:54.998 --> 34:57.999
IT'S A LITTLE LIKE SURGERY.

34:54.998 --> 34:57.999
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY ANESTHESIA

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
FOR YOU.

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
THE PROCESS IS GONNA BE PAINFUL,

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING--ANY

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
WAY TO MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
 RIGHT.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
 BUT IN THE END, WHAT MATTERS

35:03.999 --> 35:06.999
IS THAT YOU MAKE MONEY, THESE

35:03.999 --> 35:06.999
PEOPLE'S JOBS GET SAVED, AND THE

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
BUSINESS SURVIVES AND IT

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
THRIVES.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
THAT'S THE GOAL HERE.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
 YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
 SO I NEED YOU TO GO ALONG

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
WITH THIS PROCESS.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
DO YOU TRUST ME?

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
 I TRUST YOU.

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
MAYBE IT WAS ALL THE SHOCK ALL

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
TOGETHER.

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
 YEAH, AND IT'S A LOT.

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
I UNDERSTAND.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
IT'S HARD TO HAVE CHANGE.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE AN

35:18.999 --> 35:21.999
UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY TIME

35:18.999 --> 35:21.999
YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING,

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
YOU CAN'T--YOU CAN'T--

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
 I'LL JUST TALK TO YOU ABOUT

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
IT.

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
 YOU CAN'T STORM OFF.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
 OKAY.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
 AND YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO

35:26.999 --> 35:28.000
CHANNEL THAT INTO POSITIVE

35:26.999 --> 35:28.000
THINGS, AND YOU GOTTA LEARN THIS

35:28.000 --> 35:33.999
BUSINESS.

35:29.999 --> 35:33.999
OKAY? THEN LET'S GO.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK. OKAY?

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
I'M HAPPY WITH WHAT I'VE SEEN

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
HERE.

35:41.999 --> 35:45.999
I SPENT OVER $1/2 MILLION

35:41.999 --> 35:45.999
TURNING THIS PLACE AROUND.

35:45.999 --> 35:47.999
WELL, THIS LOOKS A LOT BETTER IN

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
HERE.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
DISTRACTING DECOR AND MURALS AND

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
REDESIGNED THE LAYOUT SO THAT

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THE PLACE

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
CAN BE UTILIZED TO GENERATE

35:53.999 --> 35:55.999
REVENUE.

35:55.999 --> 35:59.999
THE CUSTOMER LOUNGE IS NOW A

35:55.999 --> 35:59.999
FULL-RANGE PARTS AND ACCESSORIES

35:59.999 --> 36:02.999
DEPARTMENT.

35:59.999 --> 36:02.999
THE SHOWROOM HAS BEEN CONVERTED

36:02.999 --> 36:05.999
INTO A DISPLAY AREA WHERE

36:02.999 --> 36:05.999
CUSTOMERS CAN SHOP FOR VEHICLE

36:05.999 --> 36:09.999
UPGRADES LIKE RIMS, TIRES, AND

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
SUSPENSION SYSTEMS.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
WITH THE GRAND OPENING RIGHT

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
AROUND THE CORNER, WE'RE ADDING

36:11.999 --> 36:18.999
THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO GET

36:13.999 --> 36:18.999
AUTOMATCH USA READY FOR ITS

36:15.999 --> 36:18.999
FIRST CUSTOMER.

36:25.999 --> 36:28.999
TRY TO GET THIS CLEARED, 'CAUSE

36:25.999 --> 36:28.999
WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS

36:28.999 --> 36:32.999
CREATING A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE

36:28.999 --> 36:32.999
WHEN THEY PARK.

36:32.999 --> 36:35.999
 I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SNOW THIS

36:32.999 --> 36:35.999
BAD IN SO LONG, AND OF COURSE OF

36:35.999 --> 36:38.999
ALL DAYS, MY LUCK, DURING THE

36:35.999 --> 36:38.999
GRAND OPENING.

36:38.999 --> 36:43.999
AND IT SUCKS.

36:38.999 --> 36:43.999
THESE FRONT HERE, I CAN'T HAVE

36:43.999 --> 36:46.999
BIG PILES.

36:43.999 --> 36:46.999
SEE THAT STARTING TO PILE UP?

36:46.999 --> 36:51.999
 YES.

36:46.999 --> 36:51.999
 TODAY'S THE GRAND OPENING,

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
AND WE HAVE WEATHER WORKING

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
AGAINST US.

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO MESS THIS

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
UP.

36:55.999 --> 36:59.999
THIS IS A HUGE DAY.

36:55.999 --> 36:59.999
 WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

36:59.999 --> 37:03.999
OKAY, BYE.

36:59.999 --> 37:03.999
 HEY, MAN.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
WHERE'S THE HAULER AT?

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
 THEY SAID THEY'RE ON THEIR

37:05.999 --> 37:06.999
WAY.

37:05.999 --> 37:06.999
THEY'LL BE HERE WITHIN A

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
HALF-HOUR.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
 'CAUSE WE'RE OPENING SOON.

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
 I KNOW. I'M SORRY, I KNOW.

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
THEY SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE.

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
GUESS THEY GOT STUCK WITH THE

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
SNOW.

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
 THE GRAND OPENING IS MINUTES

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
AWAY.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
WE'RE STILL WAITING ON TWO

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
HAULERS WITH 20 CARS.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT WE'RE

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
HAVING THE GRAND OPENING SOON

37:19.999 --> 37:22.999
AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE CARS

37:19.999 --> 37:22.999
HERE IS A PROBLEM.

37:22.999 --> 37:25.999
 I WANT TO SHOW MARCUS HOW

37:22.999 --> 37:25.999
IMPORTANT AUTOMATCH IS AS ATHANS

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
MOTORS WAS, BECAUSE IT MEANS

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
EVERYTHING TO ME.

37:27.999 --> 37:31.999
 OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T FACTOR ON

37:27.999 --> 37:31.999
SNOW, BUT IT'S CHICAGO, SO WE

37:31.999 --> 37:34.999
SHOULD KIND OF PLAN FOR IT.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.999
 SHOULD'VE HAD THEM COME THREE

37:34.999 --> 37:37.999
HOURS EARLIER.

37:34.999 --> 37:37.999
 ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S MAKE

37:37.999 --> 37:41.999
SURE THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS

37:37.999 --> 37:41.999
RIGHT.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
 [bleep].

37:43.999 --> 37:46.999
TROUBLE AND YOU NEED MY HELP,

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
LOG ON TO THEPROFITCASTING.COM.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999

HAVING THE GRAND OPENING SOON

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE CARS

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999

37:55.999 --> 38:00.999
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S MAKE SURE

37:56.999 --> 38:00.999
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS RIGHT.

38:00.999 --> 38:07.999
 [bleep].

38:00.999 --> 38:07.999
[horn honks]

38:07.999 --> 38:08.999
 ONE OF THE HAULERS JUST

38:09.999 --> 38:14.999
IT'S TIME TO START UNLOADING.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.999
KEEP GOING.

38:17.999 --> 38:21.999
 THEY'RE ALL FINE.

38:17.999 --> 38:21.999
THE SECOND ONE'S GOTTA FACE IN.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.999
 THE SECOND HAULER JUST SHOWED

38:21.999 --> 38:24.999
UP AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CARS TO

38:24.999 --> 38:27.999
UNLOAD.

38:24.999 --> 38:27.999
 WE GOTTA MOVE.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
WE'RE LATE. WE GOTTA MOVE.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
 PETE IS REALLY WORKING HARD

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
TO GET THINGS DONE.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
 OH, [bleep].

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
 HE'S MAKING UP FOR THE LATE

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
ARRIVAL.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
 PUT THE SHOVEL DOWN.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE A CAR.

38:36.999 --> 38:40.999
ONE, TWO, TRY ONE MORE.

38:36.999 --> 38:40.999
ONE AT A TIME WE TAKE 'EM OFF.

38:40.999 --> 38:43.999
LOT OF WORK.

38:40.999 --> 38:43.999
MARCUS, ALL THE CARS ARE CLEANED

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
OFF, ALL THE SNOW.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
 IT LOOKS GOOD.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
I'LL TAKE THE SHOVEL AND I'LL

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
GO GRAB THAT SECTION OVER THERE.

38:47.999 --> 38:50.999
 OKAY.

38:47.999 --> 38:50.999
 HI. WELCOME.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.999
THANKS FOR BRAVING THE WEATHER.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.999
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE EXPECTED TO

38:53.999 --> 38:56.999
GET OVER SIX INCHES OF SNOW.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.999
WELCOME TO AUTOMATCH USA.

38:56.999 --> 38:59.999
I STARTED NOTICING A STEADY

38:56.999 --> 38:59.999
STREAM OF CUSTOMERS ARRIVING.

38:59.999 --> 39:01.999
WHO ARE YOU?
