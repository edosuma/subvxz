00:16.517 --> 00:18.031
Hello.

00:18.258 --> 00:19.607
Is anybody here?

00:20.559 --> 00:21.766
Hello.

00:22.734 --> 00:24.466
I came like you asked.

00:27.175 --> 00:28.684
Hello.

00:32.983 --> 00:37.016
In celebration of our
finally getting together

00:37.017 --> 00:38.422
for dinner,

00:38.423 --> 00:40.586
I have made...

00:40.587 --> 00:43.985
a very special dessert.

00:43.986 --> 00:46.291
Martha, that looks incredible.

00:46.292 --> 00:48.095
It's to die for, literally.

00:48.096 --> 00:51.141
I call it "Death by chocolate."

00:51.142 --> 00:53.016
Now given your
baking experience,

00:53.017 --> 00:54.680
- is that a prediction?
- Ha ha ha ha.

00:54.681 --> 00:56.908
I take it cooking's not one
of your talents, Martha.

00:56.909 --> 00:59.474
Well, not really.

00:59.475 --> 01:02.078
I sort of save my
creative energy

01:02.079 --> 01:06.117
to perfect a more
worthy craft--acting.

01:06.118 --> 01:07.759
And what about you, Jim?

01:07.760 --> 01:08.891
How's the law treating you?

01:08.892 --> 01:10.698
Uh, good.
I've got a class action lawsuit

01:10.699 --> 01:12.091
that's, uh, keeping
me pretty busy.

01:12.092 --> 01:12.857
Nice.

01:12.858 --> 01:15.498
Oh, well, I hope you find
time to cut loose, Jim,

01:15.499 --> 01:16.929
and just do something fun.

01:16.930 --> 01:17.683
Oh, of course.

01:17.684 --> 01:19.142
I-I try to take in
a baseball game

01:19.143 --> 01:20.270
every now and again.

01:20.271 --> 01:21.450
Ooh, Lord.

01:21.451 --> 01:22.769
Baseball.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.549
Isn't that dreadfully dull?

01:26.092 --> 01:27.242
Well, it requires

01:27.243 --> 01:28.755
a certain patience.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.762
A certain lack of
pulse, you mean.

01:32.256 --> 01:33.120
I think, uh,

01:33.121 --> 01:36.495
what my dad responds to
is the game's nuance.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.033
Oh, well, yes, of course.
It has its merits.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.137
Yeah, I think my
mother just means

01:41.138 --> 01:42.782
it's not exactly, uh,

01:42.992 --> 01:44.085
action-packed.

01:44.086 --> 01:44.770
Right, but that would

01:44.771 --> 01:46.747
depend on how you
look at it, right?

01:46.748 --> 01:48.525
Yeah, I mean I suppose
it does appeal

01:48.526 --> 01:50.839
to the more... serious,

01:50.840 --> 01:51.892
more...

01:51.893 --> 01:52.984
discerning crowd.

01:57.435 --> 01:58.665
Jim...

02:00.495 --> 02:03.001
What exactly does that mean?

02:03.002 --> 02:05.434
Just that actors,
by their nature,

02:05.435 --> 02:07.753
aren't the most serious
people in the world, right?

02:07.754 --> 02:09.598
Oh, is that so?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.705
So you think I'm not
a serious person?

02:11.706 --> 02:14.118
How about if we dive
in to this dessert?

02:17.526 --> 02:19.168
Because honestly, that
whole death thing...

02:19.169 --> 02:20.341
is sounding pretty
good right now.

02:20.342 --> 02:21.634
There's been a murder downtown.

02:21.635 --> 02:22.936
Close enough.

02:23.195 --> 02:24.855
I'm so sorry that
we have to run.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.661
You two be careful.

02:26.662 --> 02:28.349
Yeah, you guys, too.

02:30.981 --> 02:33.233
I'm just saying, there
have been worse dinners.

02:33.234 --> 02:34.152
Like what?

02:34.153 --> 02:36.695
Well, the dining scene from
"Alien" comes to mind.

02:36.873 --> 02:39.298
Honestly, a creature bursting
out of my dad's chest

02:39.299 --> 02:40.526
might have lightened the mood.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.770
I guess we should've
expected it.

02:41.771 --> 02:43.420
They come from such
different worlds.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.946
Yeah, well, your mom should've
been more sensitive to that.

02:46.388 --> 02:47.579
Wait. What?

02:47.804 --> 02:48.929
Thanks.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.022
Ooh. You look nice.

02:51.023 --> 02:53.420
Lipstick, huh?
Date night?

02:53.421 --> 02:56.143
No, dinner with her
dad and my mom.

02:56.513 --> 02:59.161
Wow. Already?
How'd that go?

03:01.502 --> 03:04.103
Okay.
Well, speaking of fathers,

03:04.104 --> 03:05.552
we have one right over here.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.176
Father Joe McMurtry, 52.

03:08.177 --> 03:10.745
Real estate lady showed up
to show the property...

03:10.746 --> 03:13.312
And found religion instead.

03:13.554 --> 03:14.544
So... do we know

03:14.545 --> 03:17.061
what our victim was doing
in an abandoned building?

03:17.062 --> 03:17.848
Not yet.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.597
And he's a long way from home.
His parish is uptown.

03:20.598 --> 03:21.811
Time of death?

03:21.812 --> 03:23.854
Between 7:00
and 10:00 last night.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.232
Likely cause of death,
three to the chest.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.699
That's a tight grouping.
Killer's a marksman.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.000
Careful, too. He picked up
all the spent shell casings.

03:32.001 --> 03:33.150
Security cams?

03:33.151 --> 03:34.601
None of 'em are pointing
at this building.

03:34.602 --> 03:36.681
Well, this looks like
the work of a pro.

03:36.682 --> 03:39.279
Someone had a priest
assassinated?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.943
It's like a Vatican conspiracy.

03:40.944 --> 03:42.934
Ah, it's "The DaVinci Code."

03:42.935 --> 03:45.212
Or not.

03:45.213 --> 03:47.685
So why don't we look
into McMurtry's life

03:47.686 --> 03:49.477
and see if anyone had motive?

03:49.478 --> 03:51.704
A nun is meeting us downtown.
She worked closely with him.

03:51.705 --> 03:52.902
So she might be able
to shed some light.

03:52.903 --> 03:54.823
Thanks.
Yeah. We got it.

03:54.824 --> 03:56.481
So, uh...

03:59.141 --> 04:02.006
Unis on the canvass got a
hit on Chumson's Tavern.

04:02.007 --> 04:03.100
Bartender there--

04:03.101 --> 04:04.901
Jerry Jenkins-- says he
knows about the murder

04:04.902 --> 04:06.295
but he'll only speak
to a detective.

04:06.296 --> 04:07.559
Okay, Castle and I
will talk to him.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.899
You guys chat with the nun.

04:08.900 --> 04:09.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

04:09.858 --> 04:10.899
We're interviewing a nun?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.478
Yeah, and I'm gonna
be the good cop.

04:12.479 --> 04:14.129
You're gonna be the bad cop, so...

04:16.214 --> 04:17.507
Ah.

04:19.974 --> 04:22.196
I asked for a detective
seeing as how my customers

04:22.197 --> 04:24.829
tend to get scared away
by uniformed cops.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.767
Jerry, what do you
know about the murder?

04:26.768 --> 04:29.659
Last night this guy
wanders in--Leo.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.155
Says he heard shots
on the corner of 5th,

04:32.459 --> 04:34.940
then he seen some guy hustling
out of the building there.

04:34.941 --> 04:35.762
Then today,

04:35.763 --> 04:37.301
I hear some priest got popped.

04:37.302 --> 04:39.152
So this Leo was a witness.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.015
Any idea where Leo is now?

04:41.016 --> 04:41.997
He got pretty lit,

04:41.998 --> 04:43.688
so I loaded him in a
cab and sent him home

04:43.689 --> 04:44.799
up in the Bronx.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.172
Do you remember the address?

04:46.173 --> 04:47.257
Sure.

04:47.655 --> 04:51.381
9245 223rd Street.

04:54.807 --> 04:57.872
- Right this way.
- Oh, okay.

04:58.370 --> 05:00.341
A nun walks into a precinct...

05:00.342 --> 05:02.540
It's like the beginnings
of a bad joke.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.481
Want to borrow a
comb or something?

05:07.482 --> 05:08.699
Shut up.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.085
You know what this
reminds me of?

05:10.086 --> 05:12.018
Watching one of those
body-switching movies,

05:12.019 --> 05:13.602
where the guy looks
like a grown man,

05:13.603 --> 05:14.878
but he's actually 12.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.530
Hey, let me tell you something--

05:16.531 --> 05:18.958
Catholic school is like combat.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.685
Unless you've been
there, you don't know.

05:20.686 --> 05:23.766
Uh, I have been
there-- in combat--

05:23.767 --> 05:26.354
and it's way worse
than some old lady.

05:33.295 --> 05:35.553
This is a dark day.

05:35.554 --> 05:38.150
Father McMurtry was
such a caring man,

05:38.151 --> 05:39.851
so devoted to his parishioners,

05:39.852 --> 05:40.983
his community.

05:40.984 --> 05:42.955
That he should meet such a fate...

05:42.956 --> 05:45.188
Sister Mary, we have a
few questions for you

05:45.189 --> 05:46.384
about Father McMurtry.

05:46.385 --> 05:49.431
That is, if you're up
for it, sister Mary.

05:50.008 --> 05:52.872
I can tell you anything you
need to know about the father,

05:52.873 --> 05:54.912
including who murdered him.

05:54.913 --> 05:56.064
You know who killed him?

05:56.065 --> 05:58.070
Isn't that what I just said?

05:59.343 --> 06:00.508
I was afraid

06:00.509 --> 06:02.483
their friendship
would end badly.

06:02.484 --> 06:04.334
But the father was so trusting,

06:04.335 --> 06:06.397
always trying to
save lost souls,

06:06.398 --> 06:09.966
even souls as black
as that man's.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.545
What man, sister Mary?

06:11.974 --> 06:13.731
Michael Dolan.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.382
This is Mickey
Dolan-- the mobster,

06:16.383 --> 06:18.592
the enforcer for the
O'Reilly family?

06:18.593 --> 06:20.669
The very same.

06:21.061 --> 06:23.295
He and Dolan grew up together.

06:23.873 --> 06:25.828
I-I tried to warn him,

06:25.829 --> 06:28.026
but he always believed

06:28.027 --> 06:30.892
he could set Mr. Dolan
on a better path.

06:31.175 --> 06:32.619
He died believing it.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.261
If they were friends,

06:34.262 --> 06:36.302
why do you think that
Dolan killed him?

06:36.545 --> 06:38.276
They had a terrible fight

06:38.277 --> 06:39.844
outside the church two days ago.

06:39.845 --> 06:41.354
I don't know what it was about,

06:41.355 --> 06:44.071
but the father was
very upset afterwards.

06:44.072 --> 06:45.746
Very upset.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.463
Well, a fight alone
doesn't prove--

06:47.464 --> 06:49.576
I wasn't finished.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.446
Of course. I'm--I'm sorry.

06:51.447 --> 06:53.939
As I was about to say,

06:53.940 --> 06:56.283
last night at 6:00,

06:56.284 --> 06:59.774
the father got a call and
left in the middle of mass.

06:59.775 --> 07:02.588
He told me the call
was about Dolan.

07:03.976 --> 07:05.652
Ah, the priest and the mobster.

07:05.653 --> 07:07.110
It's a classic story.

07:07.111 --> 07:09.734
Friends since childhood.
One takes a higher calling

07:09.735 --> 07:12.780
while the other follows a
path to crime and murder.

07:12.781 --> 07:14.194
Well, if this witness
can ID Dolan,

07:14.195 --> 07:16.497
then his path is gonna lead
straight to state prison.

07:16.498 --> 07:18.219
I still think we should've
taken the subway.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.405
It's kind of dangerous
to park up here.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.704
It's gonna be fine.

07:21.587 --> 07:23.247
What exactly did
you mean earlier

07:23.248 --> 07:25.189
when you said my mother
could be more considerate?

07:25.190 --> 07:26.195
I just--I meant that

07:26.196 --> 07:27.742
I wished that you
would've asked her

07:27.743 --> 07:29.230
to stop criticizing my dad.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.725
She was just
expressing an opinion

07:30.726 --> 07:32.034
in much the same way
your father was

07:32.035 --> 07:34.204
when he basically called
my mom flighty and stupid.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.792
My dad never said that, Castle.

07:35.793 --> 07:38.072
You know what?
Just drop it.

07:38.073 --> 07:39.212
Fine.

07:47.977 --> 07:49.303
You know, to be fair,

07:50.173 --> 07:52.120
she was just commenting
about his pastime,

07:52.121 --> 07:53.681
while he was insulting her.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.245
Castle, watch it.

07:55.246 --> 07:56.119
What?
There's a big difference--

07:56.120 --> 07:57.406
Don't.

07:58.363 --> 07:59.953
Drop it.

08:02.152 --> 08:04.292
Toss your phones and wallet.

08:05.348 --> 08:06.362
All right.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.164
You guys are making
a big mistake.

08:12.305 --> 08:13.694
I'm a cop.

08:14.798 --> 08:15.981
They must be after Leo.

08:15.982 --> 08:17.415
We should call the boss.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.960
Oh, the--the boss
as in Mickey Dolan?

08:20.961 --> 08:23.039
We know about McMurtry.

08:23.258 --> 08:25.380
Just walk away while
you got a chance.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.804
You're not getting that witness.

08:26.805 --> 08:27.932
Hey, what's all the
noise out here?

08:29.301 --> 08:31.351
Sorry!
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:36.546 --> 08:37.524
Wait. Who are you?

08:37.525 --> 08:38.890
- NYPD.
- Open up!

08:38.890 --> 08:40.775
- Open up now!
- These locks won't hold.

08:40.775 --> 08:41.995
Open up!

08:42.174 --> 08:44.289
Castle, bring that over.
We gotta block the door.

08:45.882 --> 08:47.304
- Little help?
- Yeah.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.064
- It's dead.
- They must have cut the line.

08:55.065 --> 08:56.645
What is this?
What the hell is going on?

08:56.799 --> 08:57.941
We're here to save you.

Just give us the guy
and we won't hurt you!

09:10.717 --> 09:11.913
Somehow I don't believe him.

09:11.914 --> 09:13.640
- What guy? Am I the guy?
- Yeah, you're the guy.

09:13.641 --> 09:14.965
- Ohh.
- Open up!

09:15.542 --> 09:16.571
What do they want with me?

09:16.572 --> 09:18.443
That guy you saw holding a gun?

09:18.606 --> 09:22.301
Well, he killed somebody,
and you're the witness.

09:22.302 --> 09:23.737
A witness they want
to get rid of.

09:23.738 --> 09:25.806
Okay, this is not good.
Not good.

09:25.807 --> 09:27.433
H-how do they even
know what I saw?

09:27.802 --> 09:30.506
The same way we do.
You ran your mouth off at a bar.

09:30.507 --> 09:31.486
But it was--it was dark.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.355
I mean, I didn't even
really see that much.

09:33.356 --> 09:34.988
As far as they're concerned,
you saw enough.

09:34.989 --> 09:36.941
Oh, God.
We-- we gotta get outta here.

09:36.942 --> 09:37.971
Do you think?

09:41.098 --> 09:42.285
Come on, guys.
It's not going to take

09:42.286 --> 09:44.155
- Dolan's boys long to get through that door.
- You better open up!

09:44.156 --> 09:46.464
I'm sorry. Dolan?
As in Mickey Dolan, the--the mobster?

09:46.465 --> 09:48.669
Oh, God. We're gonna end
up floating in the river

09:48.670 --> 09:50.030
with cement shoes on.

09:50.031 --> 09:51.664
Yes, well, technically,
if you have cement shoes,

09:51.665 --> 09:53.114
- you're not gonna be floating.
- What?

09:53.115 --> 09:54.822
- What? 
- You're right. That's not helping.

09:54.823 --> 09:55.794
Let's go.

10:06.443 --> 10:07.741
Dude, where's your car?

10:07.742 --> 10:09.358
- Where's my car?
- Where's your car?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.500
It was right here.

10:11.501 --> 10:12.950
You parked here?
Are you kidding me?

10:12.951 --> 10:14.444
Don't you see this neighborhood?

10:15.843 --> 10:16.834
Don't.

10:17.656 --> 10:19.596
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

10:22.102 --> 10:23.348
Get the car.

10:24.655 --> 10:25.909
So the nun was right.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.949
Father McMurtry did fight
with Mickey Dolan.

10:27.950 --> 10:29.664
Surveillance cam footage
outside the church

10:29.665 --> 10:31.517
backs sister Mary's story.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.307
Not that I'd ever doubt a nun.

10:33.308 --> 10:35.107
What about the
phone call McMurtry got?

10:35.108 --> 10:36.439
You trace it to Dolan?

10:36.440 --> 10:37.880
Yeah, it was made
from a pay phone.

10:37.881 --> 10:38.882
The guy spent 20 years

10:38.883 --> 10:40.557
rising through the ranks
of the Irish mob.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.421
Not surprising he'd
cover his tracks.

10:42.422 --> 10:43.688
Dolan and his kill squad

10:43.689 --> 10:45.504
are as smart as
they are ruthless.

10:45.505 --> 10:48.144
And as the enforcer for
the O'Reilly family,

10:48.145 --> 10:50.544
he's the prime suspect
in dozens of hits.

10:50.545 --> 10:53.185
Only we've never been able
to make a case against him.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.157
Yo.

10:54.158 --> 10:55.669
Unis came back from
Dolan's apartment.

10:55.670 --> 10:56.953
Looks like he hasn't
been there in a while.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.224
Does the Organized Crime
Task Force know where he is?

10:59.225 --> 11:00.619
They say that he's
been off their radar

11:00.620 --> 11:01.960
the past few days.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.822
Word is, there's
something big going on--

11:03.823 --> 11:04.899
maybe a turf war

11:04.900 --> 11:07.347
or a power struggle within
the O'Reilly family.

11:07.348 --> 11:08.451
There may be bloodshed,

11:08.452 --> 11:10.272
so they figure that
Dolan went underground.

11:10.273 --> 11:12.780
The guy took out a priest.
We can't just let him disappear.

11:12.781 --> 11:14.130
No, no, even if we
knew where he was,

11:14.131 --> 11:15.630
we don't have enough
to charge him.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.297
Shoot Beckett Dolan's mug shot.

11:17.298 --> 11:18.754
See if their witness
can ID him.

11:18.755 --> 11:19.969
Yeah, we're on it.

11:29.204 --> 11:30.377
Is it them?

11:30.660 --> 11:31.728
Yeah, that's them.

11:31.729 --> 11:33.674
Well, our night has
officially been trashed.

11:33.675 --> 11:35.408
Hurry, Castle.
The pay phone, before they get back.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.027
I can't believe they
still have these things.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.266
All right, does anybody have a--

11:38.267 --> 11:39.817
A dollar?
Are you kidding me?

11:39.818 --> 11:41.927
You don't need coins
to call 9-1...

11:42.990 --> 11:44.078
We gotta keep moving.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.651
Oh, great.
That's just great.

11:45.652 --> 11:46.691
We're stuck in the outer borough

11:46.692 --> 11:47.755
with two mobsters
trying to kill us

11:47.756 --> 11:49.525
and no means of contacting
the outside world.

11:49.526 --> 11:51.084
Leo, would you just relax, okay?

11:51.085 --> 11:52.356
We just gotta find a phone.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.334
Are there any 24-hour
businesses around here?

11:54.335 --> 11:55.330
No, not that I know of.

11:55.331 --> 11:57.084
Maybe we could borrow
a cell from someone.

11:57.085 --> 11:57.941
Yeah, from who?

11:57.942 --> 11:59.348
Around here, no one's
out this time of night

11:59.349 --> 12:00.418
- unless they have a death wish.
- Leo--

12:00.596 --> 12:01.872
Oh, my God.
This is-- this is insane.

12:01.873 --> 12:03.393
This kind of stuff
doesn't happen to me.

12:03.394 --> 12:05.382
I'm a paper salesman.
I sell paper.

12:05.383 --> 12:07.386
Leo, can you focus?

12:07.387 --> 12:07.966
Yes.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.079
You're gonna be okay.
We're all gonna be okay.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.296
We just have to
contact my precinct.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.560
Yeah. How?

12:13.561 --> 12:14.813
I think I know.

12:17.916 --> 12:19.101
Captain.

12:19.719 --> 12:20.956
We got a problem.

12:20.987 --> 12:22.503
Okay. What's your problem?

12:22.504 --> 12:23.999
We tried to send
Dolan's mug shot,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.539
but we can't reach
Beckett or Castle.

12:25.540 --> 12:26.930
We called their phones,
Beckett's radio,

12:26.931 --> 12:27.990
even called Castle's mom.

12:27.991 --> 12:29.241
Did you ping her cruiser?

12:29.242 --> 12:31.599
Yeah, GPS shows it's heading
down the Jersey Turnpike.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.340
Ryan, have troopers
intercept that car.

12:34.341 --> 12:35.867
Oh, and, Esposito,

12:35.868 --> 12:37.665
go to that witness' address,

12:37.666 --> 12:39.310
find out what the
hell's going on.

12:39.311 --> 12:40.270
Right on.

12:49.514 --> 12:50.976
Castle, it's not working.

12:50.977 --> 12:53.640
It will.
I'm disturbing the peace.

12:53.641 --> 12:55.042
They'll have no choice but to--

12:56.123 --> 12:57.029
offer me a beer.

12:57.030 --> 12:59.318
Next time I won't miss.

12:59.319 --> 13:00.868
You have any idea
what time it is?

13:00.869 --> 13:03.090
Yes. Please,
we need your help.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.262
Yeah, you gon' need
some help all right

13:04.263 --> 13:05.407
if you don't stop buzzing.

13:05.408 --> 13:07.630
So knock it off before
I do something.

13:07.631 --> 13:08.749
Yeah, what are you gonna do,

13:08.750 --> 13:09.768
call a cop?

13:09.769 --> 13:11.306
Matter of fact, go ahead.

13:11.307 --> 13:13.492
I'm not gonna stop
buzzing till you do.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.139
Cops?
Cops don't come up here, Jack.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.953
This hood, we're on our own.

13:17.954 --> 13:19.124
You keep that up,

13:19.125 --> 13:21.887
I'm-a come down there
and hurt you real bad.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.119
So that's your big plan,

13:23.120 --> 13:24.670
make more people
want to kill us?

13:24.671 --> 13:25.497
No.

13:25.498 --> 13:26.905
Let's go.

13:28.843 --> 13:29.998
Yeah, keep on walking.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.243
Maybe a fight will
bring the cops.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.330
Sure. Yeah.

13:32.331 --> 13:33.978
Or maybe the guys
that are chasing us?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.163
Assuming we survive.

13:35.164 --> 13:37.173
Hey, I'm trying to
get us out of this.

13:37.174 --> 13:38.819
Castle, you're the
reason that we are

13:38.820 --> 13:40.197
in this in the first place.

13:40.198 --> 13:40.824
What?

13:40.825 --> 13:42.859
The next time two thugs
are about to jump us

13:42.860 --> 13:45.234
and I say, "Watch it," why
don't you just listen?

13:45.235 --> 13:46.711
Maybe if you had listened
to me about the car--

13:46.712 --> 13:48.119
Okay. Wow.
I'm picking up some tension here,

13:48.120 --> 13:48.782
and I'm sensing it has

13:48.783 --> 13:50.140
less to do with the two
maniacs chasing us

13:50.141 --> 13:51.266
and more to do with
the two of you.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.390
And seeing as
my life is in your hands--

13:52.391 --> 13:53.948
You know what?
We're fine.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.687
Some of us more than others.
What are you doing?

14:00.439 --> 14:02.618
There's a cell phone in the car.

14:02.619 --> 14:03.682
Oh, thank God.

14:05.324 --> 14:07.097
And it's password protected.

14:08.937 --> 14:10.677
Nice work.
The alarm brought those guys back.

14:40.496 --> 14:41.667
Ryan.

14:41.668 --> 14:43.015
Bro.

14:43.354 --> 14:44.700
We got a problem.

14:57.786 --> 15:00.163
Okay.
I don't think they saw us.

15:00.418 --> 15:02.441
Yeah, they're not
gonna stop looking.

15:02.442 --> 15:04.262
Maybe I should try
and talk to them.

15:05.965 --> 15:07.382
Well, so I should what,
just--just stay here

15:07.383 --> 15:08.694
and wait for them to find us?

15:08.695 --> 15:11.254
Well, maybe that's
not the only option.

15:11.255 --> 15:13.731
If I can figure out the
passcode for this phone,

15:13.732 --> 15:14.824
we can use it.

15:14.825 --> 15:16.160
So you're The Boy With
The Dragon Tattoo now?

15:16.161 --> 15:17.966
There's, like, 10,000
possibilities.

15:17.996 --> 15:19.923
Do you have a better idea?

15:20.302 --> 15:21.825
Where's the nearest subway?

15:21.826 --> 15:23.339
Now she wants to
take the subway.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.865
The "C" train's
6 blocks from here.

15:24.866 --> 15:27.239
Okay, so on weeknights
after midnight,

15:27.240 --> 15:29.296
it runs every half-hour on the hour.
What time is it now?

15:29.456 --> 15:30.421
1:20.

15:30.422 --> 15:31.921
1:20. Okay.
So we're not gonna make the 1:30.

15:31.922 --> 15:33.078
But we can make the 2:00.

15:33.079 --> 15:34.114
We just sit tight
for ten minutes,

15:34.115 --> 15:35.209
and then we'll
make a run for it.

15:35.210 --> 15:38.338
The subway is not Amtrak.
There is no schedule.

15:38.339 --> 15:39.169
Yes, there is.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.317
I've lived here all my life.
There's no schedule.

15:41.318 --> 15:42.965
I've lived here all
my life as well,

15:42.966 --> 15:44.338
and there is, you just
don't know about it

15:44.339 --> 15:46.106
because it doesn't
always run on time.

15:46.107 --> 15:48.840
Which is the same thing
as not having a schedule.

15:48.841 --> 15:51.531
So what happens-- we go
there, the train is late,

15:51.532 --> 15:53.410
and then what, we're
sitting ducks?

15:53.411 --> 15:54.882
We're sitting ducks now.

15:54.883 --> 15:56.896
Okay, I'm starting to feel
like I might be safer outside.

15:56.897 --> 15:57.652
Okay, fine.

15:57.653 --> 15:59.338
Look, if I can't
figure out the code,

15:59.339 --> 16:01.392
then we make a break
for the subway.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.520
Fine.

16:02.849 --> 16:04.926
I am so gonna die.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.297
A tenant saw two guys
break down the door

16:08.298 --> 16:09.637
and push into the apartment.

16:09.638 --> 16:11.818
Sounds like Dolan sent
guys to get the witness,

16:11.819 --> 16:13.832
and Castle and Beckett got
caught in the middle.

16:13.833 --> 16:16.449
What about Beckett's
car, did you find it?

16:16.450 --> 16:18.925
A trooper stopped Beckett's
cruiser on the turnpike.

16:18.926 --> 16:21.598
Seems a couple of delinquents
took it for a joyride.

16:21.599 --> 16:24.070
Well, it's likely Dolan's
people took them.

16:24.558 --> 16:26.314
Or worse.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.284
Well, I got unis
canvassing this building,

16:28.285 --> 16:29.693
see if anybody knows anything.

16:29.694 --> 16:31.830
Okay, coordinate with 'em
and then you get back here

16:31.831 --> 16:33.310
ASAP.

16:33.817 --> 16:35.635
Captain Gates?

16:37.267 --> 16:38.527
Captain Gates.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.130
What are you two
doing down here?

16:40.131 --> 16:42.711
Well, after I got a call
from Detective Esposito,

16:42.712 --> 16:45.613
I became very concerned,
so I checked in with--

16:45.614 --> 16:48.017
I can't reach Katie.
What's the situation?

16:48.018 --> 16:49.439
There's no cause for alarm.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.203
It's just that we're
having trouble

16:51.204 --> 16:52.309
pinpointing their
precise location.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.583
Oh, please stop.
You are a terrible actress.

16:54.584 --> 16:56.838
There is no way that
anyone would've called me

16:56.839 --> 16:58.108
if they weren't really worried,

16:58.109 --> 17:00.142
and I want to know
what is going on here.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.835
Okay.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.093
They went to
interview a witness,

17:04.094 --> 17:05.433
and we lost contact.

17:05.434 --> 17:07.788
But we're doing our
best to find them.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.449
So I suggest you both go home

17:09.450 --> 17:11.446
and I'll call you the
second I know more.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.501
I am not leaving until I know

17:13.502 --> 17:15.114
what has happened
to our children.

17:15.115 --> 17:16.247
Neither am I.

17:16.248 --> 17:17.800
All right, where is that...

17:17.800 --> 17:20.125
fancy coffee machine that Richard
bought for the precinct,

17:20.126 --> 17:20.847
over there?

17:20.848 --> 17:21.842
The break room.

17:21.843 --> 17:23.733
Okay. You want, uh...

17:26.219 --> 17:28.007
I don't want to have
to tell those two

17:28.008 --> 17:29.010
that I lost their kids.

17:29.011 --> 17:30.532
Tell me you have
something on Dolan.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.404
No, nothing on Dolan,

17:31.405 --> 17:33.700
but I started looking
into his associates.

17:33.701 --> 17:35.473
During the past week,
they've all split town.

17:35.474 --> 17:37.129
It could have something
to do with this turf war,

17:37.130 --> 17:38.616
but I was able to locate

17:38.617 --> 17:41.482
one of Dolan's guys who's
still around--Colin Clark.

17:41.483 --> 17:43.352
But he's flying to
Dublin tomorrow morning.

17:43.666 --> 17:44.545
Then bring him in.

17:44.546 --> 17:45.645
All right.

17:54.661 --> 17:55.738
You see anything?

17:55.739 --> 17:57.256
No.

17:57.335 --> 17:59.741
But it doesn't mean that
they're not out there.

18:00.183 --> 18:01.250
I got it.

18:01.251 --> 18:02.283
You got it. How?

18:02.284 --> 18:03.952
All I had to do is
get inside the mind

18:03.953 --> 18:05.091
of the owner of the phone.

18:05.092 --> 18:06.582
She drives a mini, right?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.271
Tried that. Nada.

18:08.272 --> 18:11.142
Look at the back of the case.
Hearts. Tried "Love."

18:11.143 --> 18:11.800
Still no.

18:11.801 --> 18:14.752
But look at the lock screen.

18:16.746 --> 18:18.074
What?

18:18.086 --> 18:19.760
The password's the cat's name.

18:19.761 --> 18:21.719
- Exactly.
- Great. So what's the cat's name?

18:21.720 --> 18:22.407
He doesn't know.

18:22.408 --> 18:25.161
I don't know, but as soon
as we figure it out...

18:25.162 --> 18:26.017
we're golden.

18:26.018 --> 18:28.569
Castle, we're looking for
some real solutions.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.905
And I'm offering them.

18:29.906 --> 18:32.504
How, by focusing on a phone
that's never gonna--

18:32.505 --> 18:34.813
♪ Hey, I just met you ♪

18:34.814 --> 18:36.300
♪ and this is crazy ♪

18:36.301 --> 18:37.053
You were saying?

18:37.054 --> 18:38.301
♪ But here's my number ♪

18:38.336 --> 18:40.948
And I don't need the
passcode to answer.

18:41.364 --> 18:43.647
Hello, you godsend.
Thank God you called.

18:43.648 --> 18:46.332
Hey, whoever you are, you
better bring my phone back.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.694
Wait. This is your phone?

18:47.695 --> 18:48.828
Yeah, I need that phone.

18:48.829 --> 18:50.414
It's got all my
pictures of Lola on it,

18:50.415 --> 18:51.912
- all my apps, all my music.
- Hey, hey, hey,

18:51.913 --> 18:54.369
tell her to call 9-1-1 and
tell her where we are.

18:54.370 --> 18:56.852
Okay, okay. Listen, listen,
we're in Leimart Park.

18:56.853 --> 18:58.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
exactly where you are.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.334
I used GPS to track you.

19:00.335 --> 19:02.055
You d--you did?
Okay, good. Good.

19:02.056 --> 19:05.558
Then, uh, then call 9-1-1.
We are in trouble.

19:05.559 --> 19:06.890
Oh, yeah?
Well, damn right, you are,

19:06.891 --> 19:08.554
especially if I get
my hands on you.

19:08.555 --> 19:10.014
Tell her about the killer.

19:10.267 --> 19:11.914
- Shh.
- What?

19:11.982 --> 19:13.837
Kill her?
Are you threatening me?

19:13.838 --> 19:17.075
N-no, no. Not kill her.
Killer. Killer.

19:17.099 --> 19:17.974
We're being chased.

19:17.981 --> 19:19.161
- We need you to call 9-1--
- Don't threaten me.

19:19.162 --> 19:21.152
Hel-hel-hello?

19:21.153 --> 19:22.908
Why'd you let her hang up?
We were so close.

19:22.909 --> 19:24.877
Yes, I let her hang up.

19:24.953 --> 19:26.937
Look, all is not lost.

19:26.938 --> 19:28.700
She told me the passcode.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.386
The cat's name is Lola.

19:31.702 --> 19:33.872
Bingo. Who's the genius now?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.125
Now all I need to do is--

19:36.126 --> 19:37.211
No. No, no, no.

19:37.212 --> 19:38.759
What, what, what, what?

19:39.919 --> 19:42.106
She remotely disabled the phone.

19:42.717 --> 19:44.262
Ohh.

19:44.263 --> 19:46.107
Ugh.

19:53.389 --> 19:55.367
You guys, there's a cab outside.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.931
It's going slow enough.
I think we can catch it.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.150
Ah.

20:04.407 --> 20:06.017
Oh.

20:11.709 --> 20:12.981
Hey!

20:13.305 --> 20:14.806
Hey!

20:16.582 --> 20:18.170
My ankle. My ankle.

20:18.171 --> 20:19.944
Go. Go stop the cab. Stop the cab.
I got Leo. I got Leo.

20:19.945 --> 20:20.712
Hey!

20:20.713 --> 20:23.388
Seriously, man?
You are killing me.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.402
Hey!

20:24.403 --> 20:25.436
Oh!

20:25.519 --> 20:28.156
Hey, hey, hey. "Off duty."

20:28.157 --> 20:31.091
No, please.
This is an emergency.

20:31.092 --> 20:32.563
I'm a police officer.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.085
I'm the Sultan of Siam.

20:34.086 --> 20:35.434
These are my loyal subjects.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.947
No, no, you don't understand.
This isn't a joke.

20:37.948 --> 20:39.278
We need your help.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.864
You got trouble
written all over you.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.120
I will give you $1,000
to get us into the city.

20:43.121 --> 20:44.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:44.501 --> 20:45.776
Let's see the money.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.519
Well, I don't have it on me...

20:47.520 --> 20:49.234
but I do have this lovely watch.

20:49.235 --> 20:49.885
No! No, no, no, no.

20:49.886 --> 20:51.659
It tells time underwater.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.791
It tells time in three
different time zones!

20:57.698 --> 20:59.431
And right now it's telling
me, it's time to go.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.430
- Move! Come on. Move!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:01.431 --> 21:03.450
Go. Go, go, go. Go, go.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.705
Come on.

21:11.167 --> 21:11.939
Come on!

21:14.064 --> 21:14.931
Go!

21:14.932 --> 21:16.272
Ah! Ah! Ah!

21:18.861 --> 21:20.882
Wait. Here. Come on.

21:23.687 --> 21:24.925
Oh, man.

21:31.716 --> 21:32.419
Ah! Ah!

21:32.420 --> 21:35.239
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.665
I hurt my ankle pretty badly.
I can't stand on it.

21:37.666 --> 21:39.829
Shh. It's not gonna take

21:39.830 --> 21:41.716
those guys very long to
figure out where we went.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.675
Yeah, but if he can't stand,

21:42.676 --> 21:44.485
it's gonna be hard to move.

21:45.072 --> 21:47.572
Yes, even harder to run.

21:55.341 --> 21:57.180
They gotta be here somewhere.

22:05.945 --> 22:07.338
Colin Clark.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.433
Quite a list of priors.

22:09.434 --> 22:11.413
It says here you're a
suspected foot soldier

22:11.414 --> 22:13.167
for the O'Reilly family.

22:13.168 --> 22:15.461
I also like long
walks on the beach.

22:15.462 --> 22:17.198
Your guys had no right
to bring me here.

22:17.199 --> 22:19.108
I don't have time
for games, Colin.

22:19.109 --> 22:20.167
Where is Mickey Dolan

22:20.168 --> 22:20.893
and what did he do

22:20.894 --> 22:23.427
with Detective Beckett
and Mr. Castle?

22:23.428 --> 22:25.595
You can't keep me here.
You got nothin' on me.

22:25.596 --> 22:27.825
Oh, I can hold you for 24 hours.

22:27.826 --> 22:30.171
Your plane leaves in seven.

22:30.606 --> 22:33.751
Are things about to get ugly
inside the O'Reilly clan?

22:33.752 --> 22:36.087
Is that why you're so eager
to get out of dodge?

22:36.088 --> 22:38.201
Oh, honey, I'm gonna let
you catch your flight.

22:38.202 --> 22:40.995
Hell, I'll even drive
you to the airport.

22:40.996 --> 22:43.794
But you will tell me
what I need to know.

22:44.792 --> 22:47.433
You cops have no idea
what's about to go down,

22:47.434 --> 22:49.021
what Dolan's really into.

22:49.022 --> 22:50.811
I don't care what he's into.

22:50.812 --> 22:53.612
I want him and I want my people.

22:53.820 --> 22:55.387
You know what I want?

22:55.388 --> 22:56.933
My lawyer.

22:59.403 --> 23:00.545
He knows.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.300
He knows where they are.

23:01.301 --> 23:02.136
A few minutes alone in there,

23:02.137 --> 23:03.972
I can get him to
talk about it, too.

23:04.486 --> 23:06.517
What Dolan's really into?

23:06.676 --> 23:08.399
So there's no
O'Reilly family feud.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.429
That's basically
what he just said.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.793
So why is everybody scrambling?

23:11.794 --> 23:12.504
What does that matter?

23:12.505 --> 23:13.883
Well, if we understand
what Dolan was into,

23:13.884 --> 23:15.593
it might tell us
where to find him.

23:16.715 --> 23:17.822
Where you going?

23:17.823 --> 23:18.739
I want to see if tech

23:18.740 --> 23:21.531
can lip-read that video of
him and Father McMurtry.

23:21.762 --> 23:23.716
Let's find out what he
was talking about, huh?

23:30.186 --> 23:31.876
They're still out there.

23:32.565 --> 23:33.820
It doesn't look like
they know where we are,

23:33.821 --> 23:36.245
but they'll figure
it out eventually.

23:36.254 --> 23:38.602
Well, they are not
getting through here,

23:38.603 --> 23:39.992
but the door to
the shop upstairs

23:39.993 --> 23:41.044
opens from the other side.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.702
Oh, great. So when they
figure out we're down here,

23:42.703 --> 23:43.642
they can come through there.

23:43.643 --> 23:45.970
- We'll be long gone by then.
- How? Okay?

23:45.971 --> 23:47.339
I mean, we're even farther
from the subway now,

23:47.340 --> 23:48.427
and I hurt my ankle.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.690
I'll find something
to tape it up.

23:49.691 --> 23:50.822
Screw tape.

23:50.823 --> 23:52.369
Can you find another
ankle in these boxes?

23:52.370 --> 23:53.973
Otherwise, I'm not
making it 8 blocks.

23:53.974 --> 23:54.977
We might not have to.

23:54.978 --> 23:57.012
This is a menu from a
24-hour Chinese restaurant

23:57.013 --> 23:58.091
2 blocks from here.

23:58.092 --> 23:59.570
If we can get there, we should
be able to get some help,

23:59.571 --> 24:01.417
we just gotta wait for
this guy to leave.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.668
Did you find some tape?

24:03.669 --> 24:05.454
Yes, I did.

24:05.455 --> 24:06.828
I also found

24:07.057 --> 24:09.316
a box of tools and
a broken CB radio.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.468
But I think I can
get it to work.

24:10.469 --> 24:11.868
Great.
You have an engineering degree

24:11.869 --> 24:13.009
or electronics experience?

24:13.010 --> 24:15.832
No, but I've seen every
episode of "MacGyver."

24:17.658 --> 24:18.924
What?

24:18.925 --> 24:20.298
I didn't say anything.

24:20.299 --> 24:21.534
No, you didn't have to.

24:21.535 --> 24:23.826
Well, at least I'm offering
real-world solutions, Castle,

24:23.827 --> 24:24.717
not TV ones.

24:24.718 --> 24:26.416
Okay, I'm sorry.
What-- what's wrong with you two?

24:26.417 --> 24:28.115
There are people outside
that want to kill us.

24:28.116 --> 24:28.995
So what's the problem?

24:28.996 --> 24:30.428
- There is no problem.
- No, there's a problem.

24:30.429 --> 24:31.847
It's nothing.

24:32.489 --> 24:33.886
Mm-hmm.

24:38.047 --> 24:40.717
We had dinner with the
parents, and her dad--

24:40.718 --> 24:42.987
My dad? More like your mom.

24:42.988 --> 24:44.889
Oh. Oh, m--okay.

24:44.890 --> 24:46.784
So you guys, you're
not just partners.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.426
You're, uh...

24:48.882 --> 24:49.809
partners.

24:49.810 --> 24:50.972
I get it. Okay.

24:50.973 --> 24:52.952
I've done over a thousand
hours of therapy,

24:52.953 --> 24:55.119
granted, as a patient, but
I picked up a few things,

24:55.120 --> 24:56.267
and I can tell you this much--

24:56.268 --> 24:58.939
this, uh, thing, it's not
about your folks, okay?

24:58.940 --> 25:00.098
That's just an excuse.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.485
This fight...

25:01.860 --> 25:03.456
it's about the two of you.

25:10.996 --> 25:13.225
I doubt the NYPD
would appreciate

25:13.226 --> 25:16.389
the hole I've been pacing
in their break room floor.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.925
I thought I'd join you.

25:18.265 --> 25:19.996
Oh. Brought you that.

25:19.997 --> 25:21.773
Thank you.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.350
Oh, it's awful.

25:25.351 --> 25:28.220
It's fine. I just normally
take my coffee black.

25:28.221 --> 25:28.979
Oh, well--

25:28.980 --> 25:30.904
You know, simple, boring.

25:32.373 --> 25:34.158
- Oh, no. You don't think I think you're...
- No, it's fine.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.546
- boring?
- It's fine. It's fine.

25:35.547 --> 25:37.331
I--look, that whole
dinner party thing was--

25:37.332 --> 25:38.536
just seemed so absurd.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.370
Baseball is--is--

25:39.371 --> 25:39.979
It's fine.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.519
Is--yes. It's--it's fine.

25:49.318 --> 25:50.950
Jim...

25:51.345 --> 25:53.822
I don't know how you do this.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.081
You know, I thought I
would get used to this...

25:57.713 --> 25:59.231
new part of Richard's life--

25:59.232 --> 26:01.459
the constant danger and the
never knowing--and I--

26:01.460 --> 26:04.414
but I really thought there
would come a moment,

26:04.415 --> 26:06.230
just a moment,

26:06.332 --> 26:08.786
when the worry would stop.

26:10.016 --> 26:12.227
Katie's been doing this for
more than a decade now,

26:12.228 --> 26:13.680
and I've...

26:13.681 --> 26:15.911
I've had this clench in my gut

26:15.912 --> 26:18.307
since the day they
handed her the shield.

26:20.615 --> 26:22.427
She does say, she
always feels safest

26:22.428 --> 26:24.458
when your son's
watching her back.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.695
He says the same
thing about her.

26:26.696 --> 26:27.545
Well...

26:28.604 --> 26:29.844
At least wherever they are,

26:29.845 --> 26:32.146
they have each other to lean on.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.348
Ah! Mm.

26:40.822 --> 26:42.804
What Leo said was crazy, right?

26:42.994 --> 26:44.681
Yeah. Come on.

26:44.682 --> 26:46.264
We're a couple of idiots
who can't remember

26:46.265 --> 26:47.922
what we were fighting about.

26:48.885 --> 26:49.773
So...

26:50.532 --> 26:52.285
What were we fighting about?

26:52.508 --> 26:54.366
I don't know.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.977
Look, I do know that I just--

26:57.096 --> 26:58.578
I wanted that dinner to go well,

26:58.579 --> 27:00.569
and when it didn't...

27:00.574 --> 27:02.298
You said "Different worlds."

27:02.930 --> 27:03.588
What?

27:03.589 --> 27:06.096
You said that they're
from different worlds

27:06.097 --> 27:08.081
and that we should
just expect it.

27:08.082 --> 27:10.297
And then I started
thinking about us.

27:10.298 --> 27:14.189
You're, like, this world-famous,
best-selling author,

27:14.190 --> 27:16.409
and I'm just this cop and...

27:16.701 --> 27:18.590
and we're in this relationship

27:18.591 --> 27:21.555
which makes absolutely
no sense on paper.

27:21.799 --> 27:23.674
And sometimes, I just
start wondering...

27:23.675 --> 27:26.084
Are we just kidding ourselves?

27:26.907 --> 27:29.147
What if this bubble bursts?

27:29.451 --> 27:31.240
What are we then?

27:32.732 --> 27:33.753
Kate...

27:34.329 --> 27:36.315
We're not our parents.
All right?

27:36.316 --> 27:38.107
And--and when I said
two different worlds,

27:38.108 --> 27:39.178
I didn't mean--

27:39.179 --> 27:39.749
Heads up.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.271
I'm passing a nasty
wreck on the BQE.

27:42.272 --> 27:43.860
Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?

27:45.069 --> 27:46.752
Maybe I'm not speaking
the right language.

27:47.256 --> 27:48.195
Breaker, breaker,

27:48.196 --> 27:49.758
I've got a Mama
Bear and two Joes

27:49.759 --> 27:52.089
who need a ride back
to the bear cave.

27:52.919 --> 27:55.137
I once had Derrick Storm
beat up a trucker.

27:55.270 --> 27:58.508
- Someone's cutting in.
- Ah, it's just static.

27:58.509 --> 28:01.153
H-hello. Do you copy?
Can you copy me?

28:02.254 --> 28:04.216
The mic must be broken.

28:04.217 --> 28:06.115
Hey, hey. The guy's gone.

28:06.116 --> 28:07.167
This is gonna be our best chance

28:07.168 --> 28:08.886
to make a run for the
Chinese restaurant.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.007
Okay, I'll go.

28:10.008 --> 28:11.674
No. We go together.

28:11.675 --> 28:12.739
What, with his ankle?

28:12.740 --> 28:14.181
And--and we can't
leave him alone.

28:14.182 --> 28:16.109
And one of us has a better
chance of going unnoticed.

28:16.110 --> 28:17.327
Castle, I'm the cop.

28:17.328 --> 28:19.880
Which is why you should
stay with the witness.

28:19.881 --> 28:21.437
Besides, it's him they
want dead, not me.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.916
Thanks for the reminder.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.067
Hey.

28:25.519 --> 28:26.983
Don't worry.

28:29.886 --> 28:31.760
I'll bring you
back a doggie bag.

28:37.881 --> 28:40.962
All right. Just be...
inconspicuous.

28:40.963 --> 28:42.264
Just an average white guy

28:42.265 --> 28:44.721
walking in the Bronx,
middle of the night.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.564
What could go wrong?

28:52.381 --> 28:53.318
So we think we know

28:53.319 --> 28:55.224
what Mickey and our victim
were fighting about.

28:55.225 --> 28:57.641
Camera was too far away, so
tech couldn't read their lips,

28:57.642 --> 28:58.595
but we found something else.

28:58.596 --> 29:00.843
Look what happens right
after Mickey leaves.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.665
Check out the guys in the car.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.331
Those are federal agents.

29:06.332 --> 29:08.556
Looks like McMurtry was
informing on Dolan to the feds.

29:08.557 --> 29:10.488
Which explains why Mickey
Dolan wanted him dead.

29:10.489 --> 29:13.015
And if the feds had
eyes on Dolan,

29:13.016 --> 29:15.149
they may know where he is.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.403
Chinese restaurant.

29:30.404 --> 29:32.861
Chinese restaurant.

29:32.909 --> 29:37.029
Something smells... delicious.

29:41.077 --> 29:42.770
You don't want to do that.

29:42.771 --> 29:45.462
I'm so sorry about
kicking you in the...

29:45.463 --> 29:46.875
you know.

29:46.876 --> 29:48.405
No hard feelings, right?

29:48.406 --> 29:49.455
We're all good?

29:49.456 --> 29:51.650
I mean, we're all... good?

30:08.209 --> 30:09.078
Nervous?

30:10.724 --> 30:11.790
No.

30:11.883 --> 30:14.156
I'm, uh, I'm just trying
to send a message.

30:14.182 --> 30:16.437
They can hear static
when I press the button,

30:16.438 --> 30:18.508
so I thought I'd send
an SOS, but...

30:20.638 --> 30:21.757
It's okay to be worried.

30:23.297 --> 30:24.609
He's gonna be fine.

30:24.610 --> 30:28.262
He's, um, he's smart and
he's resourceful, so...

30:28.263 --> 30:30.855
Larger than life,
from another world.

30:31.222 --> 30:31.912
How did you--

30:31.913 --> 30:33.587
Please.
We're in a basement.

30:33.588 --> 30:35.190
Sound carries. I heard.

30:35.443 --> 30:37.104
That was a personal
conversation.

30:37.254 --> 30:38.492
About how different you two are,

30:38.493 --> 30:39.976
and that worries you, right?

30:40.770 --> 30:42.790
I don't want to have this
discussion right now.

30:42.791 --> 30:44.465
And those differences
that are so charming now,

30:44.466 --> 30:46.124
they may end up just
pulling you apart.

30:46.311 --> 30:47.830
Who are you, Dr. Phil?

30:48.020 --> 30:48.849
No.

30:49.909 --> 30:51.534
Just a guy that may die tonight

30:51.535 --> 30:53.131
realizing that life's short.

30:53.807 --> 30:54.832
Trust me.

30:55.721 --> 30:56.970
Living your life for now

30:57.009 --> 30:59.631
makes a lot more sense than
worrying about the future.

31:09.031 --> 31:10.132
So where's Leo?

31:10.960 --> 31:11.933
Leo who?

31:11.934 --> 31:14.267
You're funny. I like that.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.298
So I know the chick's a cop,

31:17.423 --> 31:19.569
but you don't smell like NYPD.

31:19.859 --> 31:21.481
So what's your
skin in this game?

31:21.482 --> 31:23.179
I'm a--I'm a writer,

31:23.180 --> 31:24.613
work with the police department.

31:24.614 --> 31:26.538
Oh, yeah? What do you write?

31:27.055 --> 31:28.056
Mystery novels.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.941
Oh. I don't have the
patience for books.

31:31.420 --> 31:34.486
But when I do read, I tend
to skip to the last page.

31:35.181 --> 31:37.011
Well, that kind of spoils
the fun, don't you think?

31:37.012 --> 31:38.665
Eh, maybe.

31:39.568 --> 31:41.917
But I got damn good at
figuring out endings.

31:41.918 --> 31:43.767
Like in the case of
our little story,

31:44.766 --> 31:46.874
I'm pretty sure it's
only gonna end one way.

31:47.182 --> 31:48.988
You're gonna tell me
where the hell that cop

31:49.039 --> 31:50.377
has my witness.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.642
You know what you're asking?

31:54.478 --> 31:56.788
Why would I tell you
where they are?

31:56.789 --> 31:57.937
I mean, I'm already dead.

31:57.938 --> 31:59.486
Why would I let you
have them, too?

32:00.574 --> 32:01.673
You play poker?

32:03.268 --> 32:05.398
I... I've cashed in my
fair share of chips.

32:05.399 --> 32:06.406
Me, too.

32:06.610 --> 32:09.393
And I find the key is in
reading a man's bluff.

32:10.728 --> 32:13.618
So let's test your
bluffing skills.

32:14.312 --> 32:15.319
When we picked you up,

32:15.320 --> 32:16.634
you were on your way for help.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.062
Right?
That means Leo and the cop

32:19.063 --> 32:21.005
are in a building
somewhere, laying low.

32:21.295 --> 32:23.228
Now is that building
on the north side

32:23.476 --> 32:25.062
or the south side of the street?

32:25.271 --> 32:26.162
North.

32:26.188 --> 32:27.299
That means south.

32:28.146 --> 32:31.526
We picked you up on the
corner of 225th and Lex.

32:31.739 --> 32:33.984
So they're within a
couple of blocks.

32:35.397 --> 32:36.970
Are they on 227th?

32:40.610 --> 32:41.843
226th?

32:42.487 --> 32:43.937
224th?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.354
Ah. 224th it is.

32:49.537 --> 32:50.665
Go get 'em.

32:54.824 --> 32:56.257
They're coming back.
What should we do?

32:59.363 --> 33:00.889
Thank you for coming,
Agent Lucas.

33:00.890 --> 33:02.802
- You made it sound urgent.
- It is urgent.

33:02.803 --> 33:05.047
One of my detectives and
her colleague are missing.

33:05.048 --> 33:06.316
I'm not sure how I can help you.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.506
You can tell me where
to find Mickey Dolan.

33:08.507 --> 33:10.300
I can't discuss the Dolan case.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.227
That is not acceptable.
My people are out there,

33:13.228 --> 33:15.441
and I don't even know if
they're dead or alive.

33:16.182 --> 33:17.308
Now where is he?

33:17.788 --> 33:19.316
We have no idea where he is.

33:19.822 --> 33:21.358
That man just killed
your informant.

33:21.359 --> 33:22.640
You realize that, don't you?

33:23.227 --> 33:25.167
Father McMurtry was
not our informant.

33:25.606 --> 33:26.899
Dolan is your informant?

33:27.012 --> 33:29.641
Not yet, but we knew he and
McMurtry were friends.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.196
McMurtry was trying to get Dolan

33:31.197 --> 33:33.422
to turn state's evidence
against the O'Reilly family

33:33.423 --> 33:34.761
in exchange for immunity.

33:35.149 --> 33:37.323
We just brought Dolan
in to discuss terms.

33:37.445 --> 33:38.981
So you have him in
protective custody.

33:39.359 --> 33:40.370
He was.

33:40.817 --> 33:43.514
Then today when he found out
Father McMurtry had been shot,

33:43.783 --> 33:44.911
he lost it.

33:44.912 --> 33:47.301
Dolan slipped out on the two
agents who were guarding him

33:47.302 --> 33:48.575
and he escaped the safe house.

33:49.616 --> 33:51.690
Wait a minute.
If he was in federal custody

33:51.691 --> 33:52.903
on the night of the
murder, then--

33:52.904 --> 33:55.135
Then he didn't kill
Father McMurtry.

33:55.328 --> 33:57.810
So who did?
Who had motive?

33:58.524 --> 33:59.764
The O'Reillys.

34:00.444 --> 34:01.426
It was Dolan's testimony

34:01.427 --> 34:02.711
that would send them
all up the river.

34:02.712 --> 34:03.953
That's why they're
all leaving town.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.254
That's why they killed
McMurtry--to draw him out.

34:06.255 --> 34:09.237
So Dolan is hunting whoever
killed the priest,

34:09.366 --> 34:12.099
and the O'Reillys
are hunting Dolan.

34:12.116 --> 34:14.687
And both sides will take out
anyone who gets in their way.

34:23.338 --> 34:24.577
The gun! Get the gun!

34:31.456 --> 34:32.623
What are you doing, Leo?

34:33.373 --> 34:34.429
My job.

34:44.679 --> 34:45.603
Who are you?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.829
Let's just say, I'm an
independent contractor

34:47.830 --> 34:49.574
trying to get close to his mark.

34:49.574 --> 34:50.728
So you're not a witness?

34:52.433 --> 34:53.594
You're just pretending.

34:58.474 --> 35:00.085
You killed McMurtry

35:00.164 --> 35:01.920
because you're trying
to get to Dolan,

35:01.921 --> 35:04.053
and you knew that if you
played the witness,

35:04.793 --> 35:06.330
he would come to you.

35:07.992 --> 35:09.085
Quick study.

35:09.533 --> 35:10.996
Why the charades?

35:11.798 --> 35:13.923
Why didn't you just
kill Castle and me?

35:14.113 --> 35:16.137
Well, it's a little hard to
play the innocent witness

35:16.138 --> 35:17.532
with two bodies lying around,

35:17.533 --> 35:20.625
so I had to go along with the
whole "On the run" thing.

35:20.949 --> 35:23.737
But now time has run out, and
I have to make my next move.

35:23.738 --> 35:25.003
You, where's your phone?

35:27.201 --> 35:29.386
Look, you--you don't
want to do this.

35:30.011 --> 35:31.138
Killing a cop?

35:31.787 --> 35:33.416
You know what kind of
trouble that brings.

35:33.417 --> 35:34.521
Kill her?

35:34.725 --> 35:37.246
Trust me, I'm not
planning to kill her.

35:37.247 --> 35:39.692
Well, McMurtry trusted you, and
look what happened to him.

35:39.747 --> 35:41.159
You think I killed Joey?

35:42.393 --> 35:43.798
Joey was my best friend,

35:44.190 --> 35:46.943
long after our lives went
off in separate directions.

35:47.626 --> 35:49.070
He never gave up on me.

35:50.247 --> 35:51.373
I'd never hurt him.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.516
I can't say the same
for whoever iced him.

35:55.099 --> 35:57.548
That's why I need to
talk to the witness

35:57.549 --> 35:59.724
before you put him in
protective custody--

35:59.725 --> 36:01.125
so I could find out who the hell

36:01.126 --> 36:03.969
the son of a bitch was
that took Joey out.

36:06.331 --> 36:07.984
How do I know I can trust you?

36:08.442 --> 36:09.432
You don't.

36:10.564 --> 36:12.023
But you don't have to.

36:12.552 --> 36:15.302
All you have to do is sit here
and wait for my phone to ring.

36:17.255 --> 36:18.637
And then when I get what I want,

36:19.503 --> 36:20.953
we all walk away,

36:21.048 --> 36:22.170
alive.

36:24.430 --> 36:27.161
Whether you believe me or not.

36:30.308 --> 36:31.782
Here. Take the phone.

36:45.757 --> 36:47.434
- You get 'em?
- Sorry, Mickey.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.570
Maybe you shoulda
sent more guys.

36:50.772 --> 36:51.901
Maybe.

36:52.522 --> 36:54.414
I underestimated you, Detective.

36:54.415 --> 36:55.912
Yeah, well, I wouldn't make
that same mistake again,

36:55.913 --> 36:58.178
especially if you hurt Castle.

36:58.698 --> 37:00.387
So how about if we make a trade?

37:00.650 --> 37:03.652
I'll give you your writer back,
you bring me the witness.

37:03.653 --> 37:04.617
No, no.

37:05.026 --> 37:06.336
I'm not agreeing to anything

37:06.337 --> 37:08.567
until I know that
Castle is okay.

37:11.192 --> 37:12.308
Shakespeare, you're up.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.416
Kate.

37:14.508 --> 37:15.529
Castle.

37:17.204 --> 37:18.210
Are you okay?

37:18.569 --> 37:19.618
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:19.751 --> 37:22.258
Listen, crazy as this sounds,

37:22.259 --> 37:25.016
I actually think Mickey
just wants to talk.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.184
Everything's gonna be fine.

37:28.197 --> 37:29.271
I hope so.

37:30.613 --> 37:32.458
Maybe then we can
reschedule something

37:32.459 --> 37:33.397
with our parents.

37:33.398 --> 37:35.628
Maybe we could go and
watch a baseball game.

37:35.629 --> 37:36.783
You know, something that

37:36.917 --> 37:38.361
all four of us can enjoy.

37:41.434 --> 37:42.380
Good enough?

37:43.215 --> 37:44.327
Where should we meet?

37:44.407 --> 37:45.607
Under the Costello Bridge--

37:45.608 --> 37:47.817
it's about 3 blocks from
you, in about 15 minutes.

37:54.535 --> 37:55.522
Well played.

37:55.992 --> 37:57.049
Let's go.

38:13.534 --> 38:14.959
Not everything I
told you was a lie.

38:15.057 --> 38:16.262
I really did have a shrink.

38:16.486 --> 38:17.663
But then he diagnosed me

38:17.664 --> 38:20.054
as a sociopath with
homicidal tendencies, so...

38:20.055 --> 38:20.906
had to kill him.

38:21.457 --> 38:23.180
Listen, Leo, you don't
want to do this.

38:23.454 --> 38:25.678
Okay, killing a cop's gonna
bring you a lot of grief

38:25.679 --> 38:27.741
from the NYPD, the FBI.

38:27.742 --> 38:29.503
Just let me go.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.125
Yeah. Sorry.
Can't do that.

38:31.368 --> 38:33.130
I did find your relationship
fascinating, though.

38:33.131 --> 38:35.498
Boy, you and Castle
have some real issues.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.265
It's a shame you won't
be able to work 'em out.

38:37.862 --> 38:39.112
But like I said,

38:39.318 --> 38:40.298
life's too short.

38:44.849 --> 38:45.722
There they are.

38:50.216 --> 38:50.993
No!

38:51.081 --> 38:51.810
No!

38:52.837 --> 38:53.692
No!

38:55.057 --> 38:55.877
No!

38:58.545 --> 38:59.351
What the...

38:59.623 --> 39:00.855
Looks like you missed.

39:05.001 --> 39:06.062
Drop the act.

39:06.619 --> 39:09.095
We both know you emptied
your clip into that car.

39:14.272 --> 39:15.199
How'd you get on to me?

39:15.200 --> 39:16.686
I wish I could say
I figured it out,

39:16.687 --> 39:18.580
but Shakespeare over
here made the call.

39:18.881 --> 39:22.283
Once you made that comment about
my mom enjoying baseball--

39:22.284 --> 39:24.319
I knew we were about six months
away from joking about that.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.502
Something had to be up.

39:27.503 --> 39:29.489
All I wanted to do is
ask you a question

39:29.490 --> 39:30.804
about who killed my friend.

39:31.997 --> 39:32.820
Mickey.

39:33.244 --> 39:35.111
Well, I guess I don't
have to ask that anymore.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.131
Mickey, don't.

39:36.890 --> 39:38.512
He killed Joey in cold blood.

39:39.738 --> 39:41.566
Yeah, I know, but
what would Joey want?

39:41.567 --> 39:43.253
You said he never
gave up on you.

39:43.902 --> 39:45.238
If you pull that trigger,

39:46.435 --> 39:47.851
you're giving up on him.

39:58.668 --> 39:59.988
This doesn't end with me.

40:00.876 --> 40:03.198
The O'Reillys, they'll
just send somebody else.

40:03.691 --> 40:04.808
You're a dead man.

40:06.888 --> 40:07.739
You know what?

40:08.490 --> 40:09.871
I can live with that.

40:11.829 --> 40:12.748
Take his gun.

40:27.925 --> 40:28.910
Put your hands up.

40:29.046 --> 40:30.735
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

40:34.671 --> 40:35.975
- I thought I lost you.
- No.

40:36.073 --> 40:37.571
No, never, never.

40:38.672 --> 40:40.008
Here. Let me get you out of...

40:40.519 --> 40:41.436
Get this off.

40:43.510 --> 40:45.194
And these are for you.

40:49.863 --> 40:51.181
Now let's get the
hell out of here.

40:51.855 --> 40:53.002
That sounds good to me.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.224
Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:56.722 --> 40:57.911
Can you help us get a ride?

40:58.485 --> 41:00.049
We're gonna be tied
up here for a bit.

41:00.296 --> 41:01.617
Why don't you guys
just take a cab?

41:06.591 --> 41:07.323
Really?

41:08.977 --> 41:10.766
- Uh... let's...
- Yeah.

41:16.759 --> 41:18.305
Can you spot me 20 bucks?

41:19.796 --> 41:21.305
Dolan's back in federal custody.

41:21.306 --> 41:22.548
So is he gonna turn state's?

41:22.549 --> 41:24.228
Oh, I don't know,
but he is offering

41:24.229 --> 41:26.216
to serve some time
for his past crimes.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.163
Sounds like Father McMurtry
got to him after all.

41:28.164 --> 41:29.466
And what about Leo?

41:29.543 --> 41:31.101
He confessed to killing McMurtry

41:31.102 --> 41:33.019
in front of a cop that
he had taken hostage.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.223
He's going away for a long time.

41:34.229 --> 41:35.353
After all this time,

41:35.354 --> 41:37.403
I still can't believe
that he was the bad guy.

41:37.404 --> 41:39.319
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,

41:39.724 --> 41:41.244
so nice to have you two back.

41:41.245 --> 41:42.283
Nice to be back.

41:42.504 --> 41:43.761
Well, as worried as we were,

41:43.762 --> 41:46.916
I don't think we were nearly
as concerned as your folks.

41:47.404 --> 41:48.366
Our folks?

41:48.367 --> 41:49.995
Yeah. I called them

41:49.996 --> 41:51.374
when we were trying
to find you guys.

41:51.663 --> 41:52.687
Your mom is, uh--

41:52.688 --> 41:54.864
I... say no more.

41:55.373 --> 41:56.997
You can pick 'em up
at the break room.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.066
Thank you.

42:00.838 --> 42:03.348
Well, I guess we can't avoid
dealing with them forever.

42:03.349 --> 42:04.421
No, but you know what?

42:05.821 --> 42:07.818
Who cares if they
don't get along?

42:08.379 --> 42:09.397
They aren't us.

42:09.789 --> 42:12.573
And... so what if we don't
make sense on paper?

42:12.574 --> 42:13.966
We don't live our
lives on paper.

42:15.354 --> 42:17.397
And if we did, we'd never
be astounded or...

42:19.222 --> 42:20.263
Surprised.

42:27.059 --> 42:28.100
How did that even happen?

42:28.101 --> 42:30.774
I don't know, but let--
let--let's just go with it.

42:32.942 --> 42:34.177
Dad.
