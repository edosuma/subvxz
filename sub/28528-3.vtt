<i>"Daughter,
if God has not graced you with child,</i>

01:45.932 --> 01:48.012
<i>you are to return to Spain,</i>

01:48.014 --> 01:50.535
<i>but only after
your dowry's repaid</i>

01:50.537 --> 01:53.217
<i>and your marriage portion
of the prince's lands</i>

01:53.219 --> 01:55.900
<i>settled on you
from my own hand.</i>

01:55.902 --> 01:57.502
<i>Your mother."</i>

02:04.511 --> 02:06.914
The litter has arrived,
highness.

02:09.476 --> 02:11.957
I didn't send for a litter.

02:11.959 --> 02:14.159
My lady, the king's mother
sent it

02:14.161 --> 02:16.323
to carry you
to the funeral.

02:51.360 --> 02:55.442
Why would God
take him from us?

02:55.444 --> 02:57.446
He sends us another.

03:01.090 --> 03:03.092
Please...

03:04.013 --> 03:06.255
try and eat something
before we leave.

03:18.107 --> 03:20.988
<i>My lady, the king's mother,</i>

03:20.990 --> 03:22.993
a day so...

03:25.515 --> 03:27.035
<i>Sí.</i>

03:27.037 --> 03:30.638
And I hope you bring happier
news, Ambassador.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.762
The unpaid half of
Catherine's dowry, perhaps?

03:33.764 --> 03:35.403
Oh, uh, no, my lady.

03:35.405 --> 03:37.846
Uh, I come to tell you that,

03:37.848 --> 03:40.529
uh, Catherine,
Princess of Wales...

03:40.531 --> 03:42.891
"Dowager Princess of Wales."

03:42.893 --> 03:46.137
We say, "dowager," for widow.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.859
She thanks you for
the beautiful litter,

03:50.861 --> 03:53.905
but she prefer
to arrive, um...

03:55.947 --> 03:58.507
<i>de otro modo.</i>

03:58.509 --> 04:01.190
And how exactly does
she prefer to arrive?

04:01.192 --> 04:04.956
In a gilded chariot drawn
by the horses of St. Mark's?

04:20.652 --> 04:22.773
<i>Bless you,
Princess Catherine!</i>

04:22.775 --> 04:24.254
<i>Bless you,
Princess Catherine!</i>

04:24.256 --> 04:26.216
<i>Bless you, princess!</i>

04:27.419 --> 04:29.580
<i>God bless you,
Princess Catherine.</i>

04:29.582 --> 04:31.742
<i>Arthur is in our hearts.</i>

04:46.880 --> 04:48.199
<i>God bless you.</i>

04:48.201 --> 04:49.320
<i>Bless you, princess.</i>

04:49.322 --> 04:50.802
<i>Bless your husband.</i>

04:50.804 --> 04:52.806
<i>God bless you.</i>

04:55.689 --> 04:57.771
<i>God bless you,
Princess Catherine!</i>

05:08.222 --> 05:10.224
<i>Princess Catherine.</i>

05:12.426 --> 05:15.229
Your loss has endeared
you to the people.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.594
<i>They share your grief.</i>

05:20.875 --> 05:22.877
They didn't know him.

05:24.278 --> 05:27.842
My own grief is,
defiled with guilt.

05:30.125 --> 05:34.287
I wasn't very kind
to my brother.

05:38.093 --> 05:40.896
Princess Catherine,
may I lead you in?

07:14.553 --> 07:17.434
What in heaven's name
are they doing?

07:17.436 --> 07:20.037
They are keening,
my lady.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.679
This is the tradition
in Spain.

07:22.681 --> 07:24.401
We're not in Spain.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.803
They must stop.

07:25.805 --> 07:29.446
No. Let them wail.

08:05.606 --> 08:09.009
You prefer a mule to a litter
made especially for you?

08:10.851 --> 08:12.091
A mule was good enough

08:12.093 --> 08:14.373
for the mother
of our Lord, my lady.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.056
Is this your way of
sending us a message?

08:17.058 --> 08:19.060
Are you to be a mother?

08:20.221 --> 08:22.942
Your condition is
an affair of state,

08:22.944 --> 08:24.183
and under
our agreement...

08:24.185 --> 08:26.866
My condition is...

08:26.868 --> 08:28.267
unclear.

08:28.269 --> 08:30.750
Ergo, so is your standing
in this court.

08:30.752 --> 08:32.952
You are no longer
Princess of Wales.

08:32.953 --> 08:35.955
But, if you're
carrying a son,

08:35.957 --> 08:40.082
you will be lady mother of the
king, just like me.

08:41.363 --> 08:43.365
God willing.

08:53.536 --> 08:55.015
<i>Come along, then.</i>

08:55.017 --> 08:57.019
<i>Come and play
with your brother.</i>

09:04.147 --> 09:06.107
The people are afraid.

09:06.109 --> 09:08.189
They say the sweating sickness
that took Prince Arthur

09:08.191 --> 09:09.630
is back to end
the Tudor rule.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.512
How much longer
will they feast upon that?

09:11.514 --> 09:13.955
Until the line of succession
is clear, my lady.

09:13.957 --> 09:16.237
Spain insists we pay
the widow's jointure,

09:16.239 --> 09:18.159
a third share
of Arthur's lands

09:18.161 --> 09:21.202
promised in the marriage contract,
and we must return the dowry.

09:21.204 --> 09:24.606
The boy is barely in his grave,
and all they can think about is gold.

09:24.608 --> 09:26.328
Unless that girl
is carrying an heir,

09:26.330 --> 09:28.010
our alliance
is in shreds,

09:28.012 --> 09:29.691
and every York
who ever had a claim

09:29.693 --> 09:31.813
will be raising men
against me.

09:31.815 --> 09:33.976
I'll hasten Meg's
marriage to Scotland.

09:33.978 --> 09:37.101
That will keep one hostile camp at
bay, at least.

09:44.909 --> 09:47.550
People speak of the color
in her cheeks.

09:47.552 --> 09:49.312
They say she is glowing.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.594
She always glows.

09:51.596 --> 09:53.516
We should
start sewing now,

09:53.518 --> 09:55.038
little hats...

09:55.040 --> 09:58.083
Rosa, she will tell us
when she knows herself.

10:03.328 --> 10:05.330
Let me get you
some wine, highness.

10:08.894 --> 10:11.695
I never would have allowed
Arthur to roam free around Ludlow

10:11.697 --> 10:13.817
if I knew there was
an outbreak of the sweat.

10:13.819 --> 10:15.098
I didn't "let him"
do anything.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.900
He was a man grown
with a wife.

10:16.902 --> 10:19.303
You sent your own children
away to protect them.

10:19.305 --> 10:21.986
- After Arthur fell ill.
- How fortuitous.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.028
This is your foul harvest.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.472
Don't try to lay it
at my doorstep.

11:11.479 --> 11:13.481
Children...

11:15.203 --> 11:18.244
something sweet
will soothe your pain.

11:18.246 --> 11:19.525
<i>Yes, please.</i>

11:19.527 --> 11:21.287
Now, let me see
if I have this right.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.089
You must be Ursula.

11:23.091 --> 11:24.490
I am.

11:24.492 --> 11:27.013
<i>Which means you
must be Reginald.</i>

11:27.015 --> 11:29.017
<i>Yes, I'm Reggie.</i>

11:41.230 --> 11:43.232
Highness.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.835
Highness!

12:00.450 --> 12:02.970
You've had
your courses for days,

12:02.972 --> 12:04.974
but you do
not tell anyone.

12:07.457 --> 12:10.138
I do not understand.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.261
My mother writes that
I must return to Spain.

12:13.263 --> 12:16.585
Tell me, Lina, what will
happen to you if we did?

12:16.587 --> 12:20.388
To Rosa
or any of my household?

12:20.390 --> 12:22.951
- I have...
- It will be a modest life,

12:22.953 --> 12:26.275
not the one your parents
planned for you.

12:26.277 --> 12:29.440
Plans must change
sometimes.

12:35.086 --> 12:38.968
Arthur dreamed that
England might be ruled,

12:38.970 --> 12:40.972
as in Camelot.

12:41.532 --> 12:43.492
It was
a beautiful dream,

12:43.494 --> 12:48.137
for you to be the queen,
for us to marry nobles,

12:48.139 --> 12:50.259
but now
we are awake.

12:50.261 --> 12:52.141
I am a Spanish princess,

12:52.143 --> 12:54.824
sent by God to marry the future
king of England and bring peace,

12:54.826 --> 12:56.828
and that's
what I shall do.

12:57.629 --> 13:00.472
God would have me
wed Prince Harry.

13:01.793 --> 13:06.476
But you are
his brother's widow.

13:06.478 --> 13:08.719
<i>It is impossible.
It is forbidden.</i>

13:08.721 --> 13:12.523
Not if...
Not if I'm a virgin,

13:12.525 --> 13:14.845
if my marriage wasn't...

13:14.847 --> 13:17.368
It was not consummated.

13:17.370 --> 13:19.129
But it was.

13:19.131 --> 13:23.614
But think, Lina.
Did you see us?

13:23.616 --> 13:28.101
Was anyone in that chamber
except Arthur and myself?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.142
Forgive me, highness,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.264
but you were heard,

13:33.266 --> 13:35.867
not just by me,
but by Lady Pole.

13:35.869 --> 13:38.550
And what did you
and Lady Pole hear?

13:38.552 --> 13:39.871
<i>Some noises
of pleasure.</i>

13:39.873 --> 13:43.074
I did try to please him,
but we did not lie together.

13:43.076 --> 13:46.398
I won't be passed around Europe
like a collection plate,

13:46.400 --> 13:50.082
handed off
to France or Austria.

13:50.084 --> 13:52.724
No. I came here to forge
an alliance with England,

13:52.726 --> 13:54.728
and that is what I'll do.

13:55.930 --> 13:59.652
Only then can I
protect my household.

13:59.654 --> 14:01.053
Don't you see?

14:01.055 --> 14:03.177
There is no going back
for any of us.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.622
Do you even know
if he wishes it?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.226
Do you wish it?

14:18.393 --> 14:20.273
I cannot stay here
with the queen.

14:20.275 --> 14:21.795
I will take
the children home.

14:21.797 --> 14:25.478
Maggie,
you must make peace.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.761
You know our children have
been interviewed by Wolsey?

14:27.763 --> 14:29.402
What?

14:29.404 --> 14:31.925
He asked if we'd had
any visitors at Stourton,

14:31.927 --> 14:33.847
any cousins from abroad,

14:33.849 --> 14:35.489
what the talk is
at our table,

14:35.491 --> 14:36.930
what banners
we keep in the house,

14:36.932 --> 14:38.212
and whether
you write letters.

14:38.214 --> 14:39.213
<i>We've done nothing.</i>

14:39.215 --> 14:40.854
They are children.

14:40.856 --> 14:42.616
And so was Teddy,

14:42.618 --> 14:45.940
<i>and that
didn't save him.</i>

14:45.942 --> 14:48.943
Make your peace.

14:48.945 --> 14:51.986
<i>There is nothing more dangerous
than a grieving monarch.</i>

14:51.988 --> 14:53.668
Henry feels God
has crossed him,

14:53.670 --> 14:56.471
so he looks for others
that do the same.

14:56.473 --> 14:59.634
A snake bites not because
it's been stepped on,

14:59.636 --> 15:01.638
but because it might be.

15:05.482 --> 15:10.287
Children, you all just
gather your things, please.

15:10.607 --> 15:12.807
Everywhere, there's talk.

15:12.809 --> 15:15.250
Outside, the people
talk of our demise.

15:15.252 --> 15:17.172
<i>Inside,
they talk of enemies.</i>

15:17.174 --> 15:21.939
In France, mercenaries are being
gathered against us as we speak.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.179
What did Maggie Pole
say to you?

15:24.181 --> 15:26.261
<i>Did she speak
of her Plantagenet cousins?</i>

15:26.263 --> 15:29.265
She still refuses to
attend my confinement.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.187
<i>Is it all my fault?</i>

15:31.189 --> 15:34.070
Is there a curse on us,
and am I to blame?

15:36.154 --> 15:37.353
Shush.
Just be quiet.

15:37.355 --> 15:39.916
All right.
Come, come, come.

15:41.519 --> 15:42.759
Now, now.
Now, now, now, now.

15:42.761 --> 15:45.161
Come.

15:45.163 --> 15:46.603
No. No.

15:46.605 --> 15:49.327
No, God loves us.

15:51.209 --> 15:53.690
God loves us...

15:53.692 --> 15:55.692
as we loved Arthur.

16:26.846 --> 16:29.007
I'm actually worse than
you, right?

16:29.009 --> 16:31.011
Yeah.

16:31.892 --> 16:33.852
Princess Summertime.

16:33.854 --> 16:37.095
You're the only
sunshine round here.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.099
Bit soft, really, so...

16:39.780 --> 16:41.419
Don't tell Charlie.

16:43.023 --> 16:45.464
I was hoping I might see you.

16:45.466 --> 16:49.109
I wanted you to have
something of Arthur's.

16:51.952 --> 16:53.552
It's fine work.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.556
Thank you.

16:57.038 --> 17:00.159
My mother herself
never uses a crossbow.

17:00.161 --> 17:01.600
She cannot bolt it...

17:01.602 --> 17:03.282
I should expect not.
She's just a woman.

17:03.284 --> 17:05.483
She cannot bolt it
on horseback,

17:05.486 --> 17:08.166
and she likes
to ride into battle.

17:08.169 --> 17:09.848
What?

17:09.851 --> 17:12.291
My mother fought a battle
while I was in her womb.

17:12.294 --> 17:15.454
Wild women in your country.

17:15.457 --> 17:18.858
They wail in public,
and they fight in battle?

17:18.859 --> 17:21.021
It's unnatural.
My lady grandmother

17:21.022 --> 17:23.343
says that the wise woman
finds strength

17:23.345 --> 17:24.984
within her
God-given role.

17:24.987 --> 17:27.627
My mother's role
is God-given.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.710
She's anointed
by the pope.

17:29.712 --> 17:32.352
Her weapon
is her horse.

17:32.354 --> 17:33.914
He's an Andalusian
stallion,

17:33.916 --> 17:36.156
16 hands,
with white socks.

17:36.158 --> 17:38.599
He can break a man's neck
with one kick.

17:38.601 --> 17:40.721
I want one.

17:40.723 --> 17:42.883
I'd ride it
straight into France.

17:42.885 --> 17:46.527
My mother is also
skillful with a sword,

17:46.529 --> 17:48.531
and she taught me well.

17:50.493 --> 17:53.054
King James of Scotland has
settled his headquarters

17:53.056 --> 17:54.936
on the borders
at Ladykirk,

17:54.938 --> 17:58.500
where he's just built
a beautiful church.

17:58.502 --> 17:59.981
Ah, come now.

17:59.983 --> 18:01.863
He's an educated man.

18:01.865 --> 18:03.385
He speaks
several languages.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.549
Well, then, I wish him
the plague in all of them.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.994
My dear child,
that is how every woman

18:11.996 --> 18:14.678
feels about
her husband at first.

18:19.643 --> 18:23.007
You know, I was
married 12 years old.

18:24.328 --> 18:25.928
I'd only had
one monthly course,

18:25.930 --> 18:29.293
just one,
before I was with child.

18:30.535 --> 18:32.537
And that child
was your father.

18:35.380 --> 18:39.142
You must do your duty,
just as I did,

18:39.144 --> 18:42.065
for your father, for me,

18:42.067 --> 18:44.549
for poor, dear Arthur.

18:45.871 --> 18:49.234
You must wed to keep
the country safe.

18:52.638 --> 18:55.519
I will see
my baby brother born.

18:55.521 --> 18:57.361
No one will deny me that.

18:57.363 --> 18:59.563
Oh, what is
that infernal noise?

19:03.209 --> 19:04.488
Hmm.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.732
This sword is blunt.

19:09.295 --> 19:12.697
They both are.
We wouldn't want you cutting yourself.

19:12.699 --> 19:14.619
Oh, I could
still hurt you with this.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.420
You may have swords and spears,

19:16.422 --> 19:20.264
but you can conquer nothing
without <i>mosquetes.</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:23.187
<i>Mosquetes?</i>

19:23.189 --> 19:24.389
And cannons.

19:24.391 --> 19:26.393
Well, we have cannons.

19:32.719 --> 19:35.000
Have cannons.

19:35.002 --> 19:39.965
The city walls of Granada
crumbled under cannon fire.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.446
Oof!

19:41.448 --> 19:43.649
The Moorish sultan
wept as he left.

19:43.651 --> 19:46.091
Weeping like a woman for what
he couldn't defend like a man.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.653
Weeping like a Moor

19:47.655 --> 19:50.017
who sees he is not fighting
on the side of God.

19:58.346 --> 20:00.348
Quietly.

20:19.328 --> 20:22.811
What, have you had enough,
Princess Summertime?

20:37.386 --> 20:39.547
You fight almost
like a real soldier.

20:39.549 --> 20:42.031
I am every inch
the soldier...

20:48.398 --> 20:50.278
And commander.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.601
And I have my own ideas
about our military forces.

20:53.603 --> 20:58.488
I'm going to have a foundry
that makes impenetrable armor.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.772
Oh, all armor
has weak spots.

21:04.214 --> 21:05.614
Here.

21:11.342 --> 21:13.344
Here.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.672
Here.

21:22.153 --> 21:24.235
<i>What is this display?</i>

21:25.877 --> 21:30.319
You dare swordplay
with the Tudor heir?

21:30.321 --> 21:31.881
- Eh, is that...
- Uh...

21:31.883 --> 21:33.122
I think she's
talking about me.

21:33.124 --> 21:34.444
I mean both of you.

21:34.446 --> 21:36.045
<i>Well, it was only in fun.</i>

21:36.047 --> 21:37.447
You are not to blame.

21:37.449 --> 21:39.889
It's natural for
a young man to caper.

21:39.891 --> 21:43.133
You, put that down,
and come with me.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.096
And would somebody
take this thing

21:46.098 --> 21:49.259
to the menagerie,
where it belongs?

21:49.261 --> 21:51.263
<i>Come along.</i>

21:56.148 --> 21:58.308
Vamonos.

21:58.310 --> 22:01.672
Ah, England versus Spain,

22:01.674 --> 22:04.595
<i>mano a mano.</i>

22:04.597 --> 22:08.879
I will not raise arms
at you, my lord.

22:08.881 --> 22:12.844
Well, I command it.

22:12.846 --> 22:14.848
<i>You're in my country now.</i>

22:23.697 --> 22:27.140
No, Your Grace.

22:30.424 --> 22:32.426
What?

22:35.389 --> 22:36.788
Oh, God.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.112
In England, widows
don't handle swords,

22:40.114 --> 22:44.436
much less a widow carrying
a prince in her womb.

22:44.438 --> 22:48.400
You do know, I presume,
the basic signs if you're with child?

22:48.402 --> 22:50.162
Oh, yes, my lady.

22:50.164 --> 22:55.049
The... The belly swells like
a great <i>piel de sapo,</i>

22:55.690 --> 22:56.929
<i>the melon.</i>

22:56.931 --> 23:00.133
No. The early signs,

23:00.135 --> 23:03.536
disagreeable stomach,
tender breasts.

23:03.538 --> 23:06.980
My stomach is often against
me, as I fast on Wednesdays,

23:06.982 --> 23:08.742
and my bosom
is always tender.

23:08.744 --> 23:10.864
I'm trying
to help you, child.

23:10.866 --> 23:14.868
I must know if you have bled
since Arthur's death.

23:14.870 --> 23:18.352
Surely we should have
your news by now.

23:18.354 --> 23:22.836
When my brother died,
I didn't bleed for four months,

23:22.838 --> 23:24.438
so it's hard
for me to know.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.760
I hoped you'd be
like your mother,

23:26.762 --> 23:29.683
wise and brave
as a man,

23:29.685 --> 23:32.446
but now I see you're
your father's daughter,

23:32.448 --> 23:35.289
as tricky as a fox.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.171
I have no talent for tricks,

23:37.173 --> 23:39.776
and I have
no news for you.

23:58.595 --> 24:00.595
What are these boys
of England?

24:00.597 --> 24:03.599
One so weak,
and the other, ay!

24:24.903 --> 24:26.102
Maybe not.

24:26.104 --> 24:28.464
Now Arthur is dead,

24:28.466 --> 24:30.468
we don't know
what will happen.

25:15.876 --> 25:17.878
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.950
Where were you?

25:50.952 --> 25:52.954
I...

25:53.635 --> 25:56.676
Taking Dominus
to the tower.

25:56.678 --> 25:58.998
You said before
that Lady Pole

25:59.000 --> 26:01.721
believes our marriage
was a... a true one.

26:01.723 --> 26:03.243
Yes.

26:03.245 --> 26:06.006
Then she needs to understand
she is mistaken.

26:06.008 --> 26:09.329
I have no power to make her
doubt her own mind.

26:09.331 --> 26:12.933
She cannot contradict me
if I am to marry Prince Harry.

26:12.935 --> 26:17.337
But did Harry
speak of marriage?

26:17.339 --> 26:18.819
He likes me.

26:18.821 --> 26:21.101
He wrote me
those love letters.

26:21.103 --> 26:25.065
Well, once you're sure the match
is in the prince's pleasure,

26:25.067 --> 26:27.588
it will be time
to speak to Lady Pole.

26:27.590 --> 26:32.433
If you speak too soon,
you may make waves against yourself.

26:32.435 --> 26:34.595
Ourselves.

26:34.597 --> 26:36.720
Ourselves.

27:09.554 --> 27:11.153
Hello again.

27:11.155 --> 27:12.435
I hope
my lady grandmother

27:12.437 --> 27:14.036
didn't speak
too harshly to you.

27:17.041 --> 27:19.962
She's not used to,

27:19.964 --> 27:22.365
well, girls like you.

27:22.367 --> 27:26.009
I do not grieve
as they expect,

27:26.011 --> 27:30.896
and then I feel that I am
wrong for being as I am.

27:32.658 --> 27:34.660
I feel the same.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.223
I'll teach you
how to play my grandmother,

27:40.225 --> 27:42.346
but you will teach me...

27:42.348 --> 27:43.827
- Sword fighting?
- No.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.950
I am much better
at that than you,

27:46.952 --> 27:48.712
and I always will be.

27:48.714 --> 27:52.839
No, um,
you will teach me...

27:57.363 --> 27:59.365
I'll think of something.

28:00.366 --> 28:02.368
I will sleep.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.293
You may tell me
in the morning.

28:37.725 --> 28:42.610
I knew Arthur's death would
affect you the most, darling boy.

28:45.333 --> 28:48.815
The soul of a poet
is easily bruised,

28:48.817 --> 28:51.660
but it will heal
with time.

28:54.102 --> 28:57.426
You will make an excellent
Prince of Wales.

29:00.108 --> 29:03.310
And you have another
brother on the way.

29:03.312 --> 29:06.155
Does that not
soothe you a little?

29:07.917 --> 29:10.679
Does that
cheer you, hmm?

29:12.521 --> 29:14.523
Catherine.

29:17.526 --> 29:20.848
Did you know
her mother has a horse

29:20.850 --> 29:25.094
that can kill a man
with a single kick?

29:28.378 --> 29:30.660
Break his neck clean.

29:50.801 --> 29:53.802
Fresh air is tonic
for us both.

29:53.804 --> 29:57.686
My last look at the world
before so long in darkness.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.848
Your confinement
will pass swiftly,

29:59.850 --> 30:04.934
and then you will be back into
my arms with our newborn son.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.377
My mother said that I
should guard my heart,

30:08.379 --> 30:12.862
that Arthur didn't belong to
me, he belonged to the throne.

30:12.864 --> 30:15.587
He sits beside
a greater throne now.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.468
She lost two sons,

30:18.470 --> 30:21.391
both destined to be kings.

30:21.393 --> 30:24.194
So many destinies cut short.

30:24.196 --> 30:27.878
Henry, was it worth it?

30:27.880 --> 30:30.080
Did so many people
have to die

30:30.082 --> 30:32.244
so that you
could hold the throne?

30:33.806 --> 30:36.647
We've had
15 years of peace,

30:36.649 --> 30:40.210
and I would
do it all again

30:40.212 --> 30:44.176
for England and for you.

30:45.458 --> 30:48.459
We have much
to be grateful for.

30:48.461 --> 30:50.421
Three children grown,

30:50.423 --> 30:53.504
one more
soon to be with us,

30:53.506 --> 30:56.309
an alliance
sealed with Scotland.

30:57.831 --> 31:00.634
And our love
all these years.

31:07.721 --> 31:10.242
Hold that to your heart.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.446
It will keep you strong.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.861
Excuse me, Your Grace.

31:28.863 --> 31:32.665
We carry water to warm
the Infanta's bath.

31:32.667 --> 31:35.149
Yes, she told me.

32:02.217 --> 32:04.220
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:08.024 --> 32:09.383
He's ready.

32:10.506 --> 32:12.829
Tonight, you will tell him.

32:14.270 --> 32:16.472
You may take the evening
for yourself.

32:23.239 --> 32:25.241
<i>You ready?</i>

32:30.687 --> 32:33.368
There. Look. See?

32:33.370 --> 32:35.850
So many little seeds.

32:35.852 --> 32:38.733
They grew
in the garden of paradise.

32:38.735 --> 32:42.137
God spread the seeds
all over the Earth.

32:42.139 --> 32:43.819
You must eat all of them,

32:43.821 --> 32:47.983
because you never know
which one came from paradise.

32:47.985 --> 32:50.626
Well, you can
be sure of one thing,

32:50.628 --> 32:52.868
that none of them
came from Scotland,

32:52.870 --> 32:55.671
which is far
from paradise.

32:55.673 --> 32:57.233
Come.

32:57.235 --> 32:58.874
Let's play
hide-and-seek.

33:01.479 --> 33:06.044
<i>One, two, three...</i>

33:12.050 --> 33:13.409
It was him, then me.

33:13.411 --> 33:14.410
Yes.

33:14.412 --> 33:16.132
I like here.

33:16.134 --> 33:19.736
In England
or this tavern?

33:19.738 --> 33:21.778
Here, tavern.

33:23.622 --> 33:26.463
Such a strange country.

33:26.465 --> 33:27.904
And they lock up their feelings,

33:27.906 --> 33:30.027
but mix freely
with each other in the taverns.

33:30.029 --> 33:32.031
The Moor, too,
can be free here.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.632
Well, the Moors
are free in Spain.

33:35.634 --> 33:38.395
Not to worship,
but to live, at least.

33:38.397 --> 33:40.918
I speak to men of ships.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.801
They talk
of <i>la Inquísición.</i>

33:43.803 --> 33:46.284
Moors who would
not be Christian,

33:46.286 --> 33:48.646
they leave Spain,
or they die.

33:51.491 --> 33:52.490
What do you mean?

33:52.492 --> 33:54.492
The <i>inquisidores,</i>

33:54.494 --> 33:57.015
they kill
the <i>musulmanes...</i>

33:57.017 --> 34:01.661
men, women, <i>niños.</i>

34:03.423 --> 34:07.466
I have no news
from <i>mi familia,</i>

34:07.468 --> 34:10.511
but I think
I can never go back.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.110
Ni ahora, ni nunca.

34:13.112 --> 34:14.632
You could convert.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.074
My parents did.

34:16.076 --> 34:18.077
Lina, you no hear me.

34:18.079 --> 34:20.839
The <i>inquisidores</i>
no care.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.962
You look like Moor,
like me,

34:22.964 --> 34:24.763
you go back, you die.

34:24.764 --> 34:27.766
We make lives here now.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.130
You sound like the Infanta.

34:31.132 --> 34:33.134
The Infanta will stay?

34:35.456 --> 34:37.337
No.

34:37.339 --> 34:39.418
Nothing is certain.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.422
Nothing.

34:43.344 --> 34:46.908
Una cosa si es segura... para mi.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.919
Where are you?

34:58.921 --> 35:01.361
You look thin.
Are you eating?

35:01.363 --> 35:03.764
I'm always eating.
You know that.

35:03.766 --> 35:05.966
You are one of those
for whom food and good wine

35:05.968 --> 35:07.728
do not alter girth.
Lucky fella.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.290
Where are you?

35:09.292 --> 35:11.892
For heaven's sake, Mary,
she's right there.

35:11.894 --> 35:13.414
Found you!

35:13.416 --> 35:15.176
- Again!
- That's enough now, Mary.

35:15.178 --> 35:17.538
Grace,
please put her to bed.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.542
<i>Yes, Your Highness.</i>

35:19.943 --> 35:21.262
<i>If Your Graces will permit,</i>

35:21.264 --> 35:23.504
I wish to retire myself.

35:23.506 --> 35:25.266
<i>Really?</i>

35:25.268 --> 35:27.909
I will spend
some time at prayer.

35:27.911 --> 35:30.033
Very well.
We bid you good night.

35:40.885 --> 35:42.925
- Oh, there's our Moor, eh?
- Oh, hey.

35:42.927 --> 35:45.567
Trying to slip the traces?

35:45.569 --> 35:47.089
Lina... estos son mi amigos.

35:47.091 --> 35:49.171
They learn for me,
uh, English.

35:49.173 --> 35:52.214
Oh, uh, you speak-a
the English good,

35:52.216 --> 35:54.016
little brown sparrow?

35:54.018 --> 35:56.178
I speak English
perfectly well.

35:58.182 --> 36:00.062
Oh, he's very good,
is Oviedo.

36:00.064 --> 36:01.744
Is good, no?

36:01.746 --> 36:03.906
<i>I buy the drinks.</i>

36:03.908 --> 36:05.548
You want a...

36:05.550 --> 36:08.191
<i>Oh, I'm dying
for a piss. Ahh.</i>

36:08.193 --> 36:10.273
<i>...in the circle, no?</i>

36:10.275 --> 36:12.435
The Infanta
is expecting me.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.679
Lina, stay.
These are friends.

36:15.681 --> 36:17.761
We mix free,
like you say.

36:17.763 --> 36:20.564
I am of
a royal household.

36:20.566 --> 36:22.766
I can't
mix free with...

36:23.969 --> 36:26.450
with soldiers.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.373
I-I'm sorry.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.617
I must go.

36:48.114 --> 36:50.116
Hello.

36:50.997 --> 36:52.597
I was at prayer.

36:52.599 --> 36:56.401
And I'll wager that you
were praying for a boy.

36:56.403 --> 36:58.964
But I am always
praying for a boy,

36:58.966 --> 37:02.289
our blessed Lord,
Jesus Christ.

37:15.383 --> 37:17.385
Today, I watched
a flock of birds

37:19.387 --> 37:23.952
flying home in a giant V
shape in the sky, swifts.

37:25.713 --> 37:28.995
They migrate here
from Spain to mate...

37:28.997 --> 37:33.001
and I must follow them.

37:37.526 --> 37:40.006
I don't want you to go.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.890
My mother is already
planning my next marriage,

37:43.892 --> 37:48.135
though in God's eyes...

37:48.137 --> 37:50.299
it will be
my first marriage.

37:52.581 --> 37:56.583
Your first? How so?

37:56.585 --> 37:59.106
I-I won't speak against
your late brother.

37:59.108 --> 38:01.468
What do you mean? Did...

38:01.470 --> 38:03.070
Wait. Did he
do something to you?

38:03.072 --> 38:07.315
No, Arthur didn't
do anything at all.

38:07.317 --> 38:09.637
<i>Because he...</i>

38:09.639 --> 38:11.681
Because he couldn't.

38:16.166 --> 38:17.645
<i>Oh, poor old Arthur.</i>

38:17.647 --> 38:19.407
I always thought
he was a rose petal.

38:19.409 --> 38:21.049
No, I do not want
to shame him.

38:21.051 --> 38:22.450
No, no, you haven't,
and you're not.

38:22.452 --> 38:24.454
It's not his fault.

38:25.415 --> 38:28.056
I simply
wanted you to know

38:28.058 --> 38:31.141
before I journey
back to Spain.

38:32.903 --> 38:35.864
But don't you see?

38:35.866 --> 38:38.467
<i>If you are still a maid,</i>

38:38.469 --> 38:42.231
then, Catherine,
I can be your husband.

38:42.233 --> 38:43.512
<i>You may marry the prince</i>

38:43.514 --> 38:46.237
<i>that you wrote
love letters to all along.</i>

38:47.718 --> 38:50.479
Will you have me?

38:50.481 --> 38:52.041
I...

38:52.043 --> 38:53.362
- Harry, I...
- No, Catherine,

38:53.364 --> 38:55.324
I will raise you up,

38:55.326 --> 38:57.687
you... you and all of England.

38:57.689 --> 39:01.211
You will be my princess

39:01.213 --> 39:03.215
and... and my queen.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.623
Harry, is it possible?

39:14.266 --> 39:18.949
I will tell my father that he
must get permission from the pope,

39:18.951 --> 39:21.033
and then
we will be married.

39:31.684 --> 39:33.204
He wants to marry me.

39:33.206 --> 39:35.806
He will go
to ask the king,

39:35.808 --> 39:37.889
and if he agrees it,

39:37.891 --> 39:40.091
I must bring over
Maggie Pole.

39:40.093 --> 39:43.454
If Harry is for you,
she cannot stand against you.

39:43.456 --> 39:45.977
No, the king would need
permission from the pope.

39:45.979 --> 39:48.580
It will take time for
a letter to reach Rome,

39:48.582 --> 39:53.467
and if she should speak against me
in that time, then I would be undone.

39:57.191 --> 40:00.832
This is the only way you'll
make a marriage to a nobleman,

40:00.834 --> 40:04.036
as your parents
wished for you.

40:04.038 --> 40:07.361
We must do this
for all our household.

40:16.090 --> 40:19.213
Ooh. I have a cramp.

40:20.615 --> 40:22.014
Should I call the physician?

40:22.016 --> 40:23.496
Mm.

40:23.498 --> 40:24.937
<i>Father.</i>

40:24.939 --> 40:26.779
Lady Mother,
are you well?

40:26.781 --> 40:28.942
The child is heavy,
nothing more.

40:28.944 --> 40:30.703
What is it, Harry?

40:30.705 --> 40:33.346
I would like
your blessing to be wed.

40:33.348 --> 40:37.230
As Prince of Wales, my match must
be in service of our country.

40:37.232 --> 40:39.312
Well, who would
you have, Harry?

40:39.314 --> 40:41.835
Princess Catherine.

40:41.837 --> 40:44.157
She's not with child,
and the alliance must be...

40:44.159 --> 40:47.161
Harry, you must
wed a maid.

40:47.163 --> 40:48.322
You know that.

40:48.324 --> 40:49.923
She didn't lie with Arthur,

40:49.925 --> 40:51.845
so she is intact.

40:51.847 --> 40:55.289
Arthur couldn't
do his duty by her.

40:55.291 --> 40:56.851
<i>Father, I would
like to marry her.</i>

40:56.853 --> 40:58.412
England is in turmoil,

40:58.414 --> 41:00.815
and this will see off
any challengers to the throne.

41:00.817 --> 41:03.538
You and your sense
of duty warms me.

41:03.540 --> 41:07.261
But papal dispensation
is required, I know.

41:07.263 --> 41:10.745
But I believe the pope will
give it in the circumstances.

41:10.747 --> 41:12.547
We shall speak more fully
about this as we...

41:12.549 --> 41:13.628
Lady Mother?

41:13.630 --> 41:14.789
Lizzie?

41:14.791 --> 41:16.511
The child is
coming early.

41:16.513 --> 41:18.193
- Henry!
- Are you certain?

41:19.516 --> 41:20.515
Come on.

41:20.517 --> 41:21.877
Stoke the fire.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.881
Quickly. Help us, please.

41:24.681 --> 41:27.522
Here.

41:27.524 --> 41:28.764
Grandmother,
is everything all right?

41:28.766 --> 41:30.445
Come on.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.848
- You've done this before.
- Is it always like this?

41:32.850 --> 41:34.169
- Henry, go.
- No!

41:34.171 --> 41:35.491
Henry, stay with me.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.972
I'm here, my love.
I'm here.

41:36.974 --> 41:39.054
- Henry, it is not right...
- I'm staying!

41:39.056 --> 41:41.016
Unlace her.

41:41.018 --> 41:42.498
Very good, my lady.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.502
<i>Father,
what's happening?</i>

41:54.272 --> 41:55.552
- <i>Father?</i>
- <i>The ropes.</i>

41:55.554 --> 41:56.993
Yes, here.

41:56.995 --> 41:58.835
Where is
her physician?

41:58.837 --> 42:00.036
Aunt Maggie.

42:00.038 --> 42:01.718
Dear cousin, I'm here.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.199
No. Why is she here?

42:03.201 --> 42:04.521
You asked for her,
my love.

42:04.523 --> 42:05.602
She hates me!

42:05.604 --> 42:07.884
She will ill-wish my child!

42:07.886 --> 42:10.887
Would you take this son
away from me as well?

42:10.889 --> 42:12.609
- No, Lizzie.
- Please, don't...

42:12.611 --> 42:14.371
- Stay back.
- Will that be enough for you,

42:14.373 --> 42:17.815
Maggie Pole,
two sons for one brother?

42:17.817 --> 42:21.659
Two brothers, Lizzie,
yours and mine.

42:21.661 --> 42:24.502
Get out! Get out!

42:25.545 --> 42:27.465
Go! Go back
to Stourton.

42:27.467 --> 42:29.226
She doesn't
want you here. Go.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.710
No, Lizzie, Lizzie,
now, now. Now...

42:32.712 --> 42:35.153
It's going to be
all right, Mother.

42:35.155 --> 42:37.155
<i>Mother.</i>

42:46.086 --> 42:48.206
Do you think he's asked
his father yet?

42:48.208 --> 42:49.848
What if he
does not agree?

42:49.850 --> 42:53.534
Highness.
A message from the prince.

42:58.018 --> 43:00.099
He says his father
will agree it.

43:12.113 --> 43:15.154
Lady Pole.

43:15.156 --> 43:17.158
Princess Catherine.

43:18.199 --> 43:22.121
I just wanted to thank you
for all your kindness at Ludlow.

43:22.123 --> 43:24.884
Arthur was
like a son to me.

43:24.886 --> 43:26.886
I would have done
anything for him.

43:26.888 --> 43:31.251
And Arthur was like
a husband to me.

43:31.253 --> 43:34.334
He was a husband to you.

43:34.336 --> 43:36.496
Not...

43:36.498 --> 43:38.979
Not a true husband.

43:38.981 --> 43:40.260
It is a tragedy,

43:40.262 --> 43:43.063
but our marriage
was never consummated.

43:43.065 --> 43:46.707
I heard you
in your bridal chamber.

43:46.709 --> 43:48.429
Your own lady heard you.

43:48.431 --> 43:50.791
We made sounds
of pleasure, yes,

43:50.793 --> 43:54.395
to cover our embarrassment.

43:54.397 --> 43:58.279
But I am as I was the day
I landed here in England.

43:58.281 --> 44:00.842
What are you playing at?

44:00.844 --> 44:03.765
Arthur himself told me
you lay together.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.526
Of course he did.

44:05.528 --> 44:09.050
We agreed
that we would...

44:09.052 --> 44:11.533
We hoped that things
would change

44:11.535 --> 44:13.697
and, in time,
he would be able...

44:15.779 --> 44:18.420
I ask you
to accept my word,

44:18.422 --> 44:21.103
accept it and support it
if asked to do so.

44:21.105 --> 44:22.384
Who would ask such a thing?

44:22.386 --> 44:25.589
The king, his mother.

44:27.271 --> 44:29.832
Oh, no.

44:29.834 --> 44:33.596
Please tell me you're not
planning what I think you are.

44:33.598 --> 44:35.678
Harry and I
wish to be married.

44:38.643 --> 44:41.764
So you've lost your husband,
but not your ambition.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.446
I warned you against that.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.728
But I will remain here
in this country

44:45.730 --> 44:47.610
and fulfill
God's destiny for me.

44:47.612 --> 44:50.693
And the family may inquire
about my first marriage.

44:50.695 --> 44:52.695
This family don't inquire.

44:52.697 --> 44:55.178
They extract
the answer they want.

44:55.180 --> 44:57.060
And if the truth
is asked of me,

44:57.062 --> 44:59.102
my answer will support
whatever keeps my conscience

44:59.104 --> 45:01.825
and my head
attached to my neck.

45:01.827 --> 45:06.352
How else do you imagine I've survived
this long in this vipers' nest?

45:22.248 --> 45:23.367
The ropes.
Get the...

45:23.369 --> 45:25.009
- The ropes.
- Yes, here.

45:25.011 --> 45:26.130
Brace this.

45:26.132 --> 45:27.251
Oh, God.

45:27.253 --> 45:29.574
And tie it off.
There.

45:35.302 --> 45:36.581
Head.

45:36.583 --> 45:39.024
Oh, yes. Yes.

45:39.026 --> 45:41.028
Oh, yes.

45:56.684 --> 45:58.764
<i>Bring the child to me. Here.</i>

45:58.766 --> 46:00.846
Yes.

46:00.848 --> 46:02.408
What is it?

46:02.410 --> 46:04.330
Is it healthy?

46:04.332 --> 46:06.252
Is it breathing?

46:14.943 --> 46:16.945
<i>It's a girl, Mother.</i>

46:21.390 --> 46:23.392
Baby child.

46:35.604 --> 46:37.684
<i>She's dead, isn't she?</i>

46:37.686 --> 46:40.169
She's dead.

46:41.691 --> 46:43.130
I'm so sorry.

46:43.132 --> 46:45.134
- I want to hold her.
- Shh.

47:12.242 --> 47:14.244
Come.

47:24.855 --> 47:27.336
I will be with Arthur
before night falls.

47:27.338 --> 47:29.738
No, Mother.

47:29.740 --> 47:33.062
I have to take
our baby girl to Heaven

47:33.064 --> 47:35.426
and reunite with Arthur...

47:37.068 --> 47:38.588
and see my brothers.

47:38.590 --> 47:40.592
Do not talk
like this, Lizzie.

47:42.554 --> 47:45.034
Tell Maggie...

47:45.036 --> 47:47.557
Tell her I'm sorry.

47:47.559 --> 47:49.479
No. No,
I am the king,

47:49.481 --> 47:51.401
and I command it.

47:51.403 --> 47:52.923
You will be well

47:52.925 --> 47:55.245
and live a long and happy
life with me, Lizzie.

47:57.730 --> 47:59.369
Meg,

47:59.371 --> 48:01.491
Meg, go fetch your
brother and sister.

48:01.493 --> 48:03.496
Go now.

48:14.787 --> 48:16.907
Harry.

48:16.909 --> 48:18.829
Harry!

48:18.831 --> 48:19.991
Harry!

48:19.993 --> 48:21.995
Harry!

48:24.437 --> 48:26.720
There has never
been another for me.

48:30.684 --> 48:33.407
You are
my one love, Lizzie.

48:37.371 --> 48:39.771
Henry! Henry!

48:41.735 --> 48:43.775
<i>I am your brother.</i>

48:43.777 --> 48:45.938
The darkness covers us all.

48:45.940 --> 48:47.419
<i>Brother, no!</i>

48:47.421 --> 48:50.424
<i>Please! Please!</i>

49:00.114 --> 49:02.475
How are we now,
my lady?

49:07.082 --> 49:08.721
I would be alone
with you, Henry.

49:08.723 --> 49:10.643
Go. Go.

49:10.645 --> 49:12.725
Leave us, please.

49:16.491 --> 49:18.493
Mother!

49:19.695 --> 49:21.975
He cannot marry her.

49:21.977 --> 49:23.857
What?

49:23.859 --> 49:27.781
If Harry marries her,
the Tudor line ends.

49:27.783 --> 49:31.385
No more boys. No kings.

49:31.387 --> 49:34.148
No kings. He cannot...

49:34.150 --> 49:35.149
He cannot...

49:35.151 --> 49:37.111
Stop now.

49:37.113 --> 49:38.152
Hush now.

49:38.154 --> 49:40.156
You are delirious,
my love.

49:44.921 --> 49:46.923
What?

49:48.525 --> 49:50.527
Why would you
say that?

49:51.287 --> 49:53.408
Why would you say
such a thing?

49:53.410 --> 49:56.373
Please, promise me...

49:58.295 --> 50:01.616
or the shadow
that hangs over us

50:01.618 --> 50:04.301
will cover us all
in darkness.

50:05.823 --> 50:07.825
Mother.

50:19.997 --> 50:21.999
Lizzie?

50:24.842 --> 50:26.844
Lizzie?

50:31.449 --> 50:33.451
Lizzie.

50:38.176 --> 50:40.178
Father.

50:41.980 --> 50:43.820
Mother!

51:01.560 --> 51:04.882
I will pray that Lady Pole
will keep her silence.

51:04.884 --> 51:07.086
I must write
and tell my mother.

51:11.771 --> 51:14.372
<i>"Dearest Mother,</i>

51:14.374 --> 51:17.657
<i>I write to tell you
that I am not with child."</i>

51:21.661 --> 51:24.262
<i>"Indeed,
there was no hope of it,</i>

51:24.264 --> 51:26.945
<i>as I am as our
beloved Virgin Mary was..."</i>

51:28.548 --> 51:30.550
<i>"and still a maid."</i>

51:36.517 --> 51:40.399
<i>"It means another match
for me is possible,</i>

51:40.401 --> 51:42.883
<i>and Harry has declared
his interest.</i>

51:44.285 --> 51:46.687
<i>Will you give
your blessing to us?"</i>
