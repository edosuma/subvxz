- You alright?

18:51.429 --> 18:52.430
- [crying]

18:52.497 --> 18:53.765
- Oh, it's alright.

18:53.865 --> 18:56.901
- [crying]

18:58.670 --> 19:00.872
You're alive.
- Uh, yeah.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.308
- The shingles has
gone to her brain.

19:03.441 --> 19:04.242
- Possibly.

19:04.342 --> 19:05.677
- I don't have
shingles anymore.

19:05.777 --> 19:10.748
- Yeah, it looks like it just
migrated over to the other side.

19:10.848 --> 19:12.984
- Yeah, check it out.
- Yeah, yeah,

19:13.084 --> 19:15.753
it looks like Italy now.
- Looks like Pangaea.

19:15.853 --> 19:18.056
- Oh, now I feel like pizza.
- Yeah.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.757
- If I have still
have shingles.

19:19.857 --> 19:21.793
- Yeah.
- And you two are still here.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.695
- Yeah.
- I didn't change the future.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.897
- What?

19:25.997 --> 19:27.398
- That little girl wasn't me.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.567
- What little girl?
- What little girl?

19:29.667 --> 19:32.570
- There was a girl
outside in 2003.

19:32.670 --> 19:33.838
She had a red bike
just like mine.

19:33.938 --> 19:35.206
- 2003?

19:35.306 --> 19:37.408
- Are you talking
about that Chen girl?

19:37.508 --> 19:40.311
- Oh, that girl that used to
hang out in front of our house

19:40.411 --> 19:41.613
all the time.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.081
What a loser.

19:43.181 --> 19:44.983
I think she moved away.
- Yeah.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.152
- After the first
earthquake, 2003.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.520
What?

19:50.521 --> 19:52.757
- I'm just really
glad you're alive.

19:52.857 --> 19:54.692
With us.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.227
- WALLY: We're glad
you're alive, too.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.430
- GRANDMA: Yeah.

19:59.464 --> 20:04.669
- I had a horrible...weird day
that I don't even

20:04.769 --> 20:06.004
know if it really happened.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.705
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:07.805 --> 20:09.741
- So I'm gonna go.
- Get some rest now.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.676
- NORA: Okay. Bye, guys.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.779
- Bye.
- WALLY: Bye-byes.

20:14.879 --> 20:17.949
- Oh.
- Oh, God!

20:18.049 --> 20:19.284
- Is the raccoon back?

20:21.343 --> 20:24.847
- [dog barking]

20:24.947 --> 20:27.049
- Hey, are you Nora?

20:27.149 --> 20:29.185
I just wanna say thank you for
all the advice you gave me

20:29.285 --> 20:30.319
when I was a kid?

20:32.721 --> 20:34.023
- Wait, are you--

20:34.123 --> 20:36.158
- You spoke to me back in
2003 when I was a little girl.

20:36.258 --> 20:38.727
I've tried to make sense
of this ever since.

20:38.827 --> 20:41.096
How you could have
predicted all those things.

20:41.197 --> 20:42.031
- What things?

20:42.131 --> 20:44.833
- You know, Uber,
Airbnb, bitcoin.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.269
I never truly understood what
any of those words meant

20:47.369 --> 20:49.705
in your rambling speech, until I
finally did

20:49.805 --> 20:51.874
and became a multibillionaire.
- A what?

20:52.875 --> 20:54.577
A what? A bi--

20:54.677 --> 20:57.580
- I needed to come back here
to see if it was all true,

20:57.680 --> 20:59.248
and to thank you.

21:01.283 --> 21:02.484
- With money?

21:02.585 --> 21:05.688
- Ooh, I don't actually have
my purse on me right now.

21:05.788 --> 21:08.657
- Wh--wh--you--you could
wire at a later date.

21:08.757 --> 21:10.893
- I live in the present, Nora.

21:10.993 --> 21:13.028
You taught me that.

21:13.128 --> 21:14.396
You.

21:16.799 --> 21:17.733
- Nora?

21:17.833 --> 21:22.238
It's 4, "Judge Judy" is on.
