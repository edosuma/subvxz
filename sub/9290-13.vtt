00:12.200 --> 00:14.472
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.568 --> 00:18.984
David, I still believe in your presidency,
and if Alan Milliken is threatening...

00:19.081 --> 00:21.801
your ability to lead this country,
he will be stopped.

00:21.897 --> 00:26.440
Milliken was driving the car that hit
and killed your daughter 12 years ago.

00:26.535 --> 00:28.647
Yeah. I saw Milliken driving
the car that night.

00:28.744 --> 00:31.848
Kelly was the only one who saw it.
Then Milliken's people got to him.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.960
- And he'll swear to this?
- "Yes."

00:34.056 --> 00:36.424
Mr. Kelly?

00:37.896 --> 00:39.784
- " What is that?"
- " It's a baby."

00:39.880 --> 00:42.697
- "I can see that it's a baby. Whose baby is it?"
- Chloe's.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.120
- Chloe doesn't have a baby.
- Adam just told me you're not
the mother of this child.

00:46.248 --> 00:47.751
Frankly, I think she's delusional.

00:47.847 --> 00:51.176
She's the only one capable of filtering
audio streams Chase is sending us.

00:51.304 --> 00:54.152
- If Chloe is unstable...
- Look, we don't have an alternative.

00:54.247 --> 00:56.008
We have got to
keep her in place.

00:56.104 --> 00:59.016
Amador will be here in 15 minutes.
Confirm that he has the virus...

00:59.112 --> 01:02.248
get him his money
and bring the virus back to us.

01:02.344 --> 01:04.935
Good job.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.047
- I don't need you anymore.
- He's gonna kill him.

01:07.144 --> 01:10.631
- "Delta team's not gonna get there in time."
- Ramon, we had a deal.

01:10.728 --> 01:13.031
- Chase!
- "Tony, Delta's here."

01:15.336 --> 01:19.176
All we want is the virus.
Just put the cylinder down slowly.

01:21.768 --> 01:23.528
Get down!

01:23.624 --> 01:27.239
We do not have the virus! The cylinder
Ramon was carrying was rigged with a bomb.

01:27.335 --> 01:29.831
Amador must have switched it.
Do we have a position on him?

01:29.928 --> 01:32.295
Delta has a team on him, Jack.
He won't get far.

01:32.423 --> 01:35.272
Hands in the air,
get on the ground.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.584
Jack, Amador ambushed Delta 3.
It was a setup.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.208
- " What about his position?"
- "We lost the signal."

01:43.303 --> 01:45.767
Son of a bitch.
Delta 3's been taken out.

01:45.862 --> 01:48.263
- They don't have a position on Amador.
- What do you wanna do?

01:48.359 --> 01:49.832
We gotta find Nina.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.824
The following takes place
between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m.

02:21.992 --> 02:25.127
- Jack.
- It's Bauer.

02:25.224 --> 02:27.495
- I have an area lit up past the fire road. That you?
- Negative.

02:27.591 --> 02:29.958
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Be careful.

02:57.223 --> 02:59.591
Stop right there.

03:01.063 --> 03:04.199
Drop your gun.
Drop it!

03:04.295 --> 03:06.439
Put your hands on your head.

03:12.486 --> 03:14.695
- You in a two-way with Jack?
- Yeah.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.062
Give him a Code 6.

03:19.271 --> 03:23.047
I'm gonna reach in my bag,
and I'm gonna pull out a two-way.

03:23.175 --> 03:24.871
Slowly.

03:32.582 --> 03:35.943
- Jack.
- Yeah?

03:36.039 --> 03:39.079
- I'm Code 6.
- What about the light you saw?

03:40.775 --> 03:43.207
It was nothing.

03:45.735 --> 03:48.199
Off, not standby.
Throw it over here.

03:51.174 --> 03:54.439
- Who else is on the grid with you?
- Just me and Jack.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.478
- You're lying. I saw a Delta team.
- They went north.

03:57.575 --> 04:00.422
- What about Amador?
- He escaped with the virus.

04:01.959 --> 04:06.694
- He ripped off everybody.
- Son of a bitch.

04:09.319 --> 04:12.006
- All right, move down the hill.
- Where are we going?

04:12.102 --> 04:14.086
Just walk.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.630
- You okay?
- Yeah.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.541
Contact Delta. Tell them
to meet us at the airfield.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.750
- What are you gonna do to her, Jack?
- Interrogate her.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.439
- No, he's not.
- Shut up!

04:26.535 --> 04:28.870
Chase, please, just trust me.

04:32.518 --> 04:34.950
I'll meet you at the airfield.

04:38.502 --> 04:43.079
Jack, Amador still has the virus.
I can help you track him.

04:43.174 --> 04:45.767
The only reason he chose this town
is because it's close to the border.

04:45.862 --> 04:48.615
He needs to get back to Los Angeles.
Once he does, he's gonna meet somebody...

04:48.711 --> 04:51.398
unload the virus and disappear.

04:51.493 --> 04:55.045
I can help you find him.
Jack, I don't wanna die.

04:55.142 --> 04:56.902
Let me help you find him.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.830
I can help you.

05:14.342 --> 05:17.286
- C.T.U.
- This is Jack Bauer. Patch me through to Almeida.

05:21.798 --> 05:26.406
- Almeida.
- I've got Nina Myers alive.

05:26.502 --> 05:28.871
- Any sign of Amador?
- No. Not since the ambush of the Delta team.

05:28.966 --> 05:31.174
Once the satellite comes around,
we'll do a sweep.

05:31.271 --> 05:34.309
- Nina says he's headed to Los Angeles.
- You believe her?

05:37.766 --> 05:42.630
I think she knows something. She wants to
cut a deal. We gotta bring her back to C.T.U.

05:42.726 --> 05:46.694
- Okay, uh, I'll get a Delta plane ready.
- Copy that.

05:50.054 --> 05:52.487
Get up, slowly.

05:55.077 --> 05:59.558
Tony, I'm coordinating too many comms. I
need to off-load some of it to Adam's group.

06:02.406 --> 06:04.550
- You have everything?
- Yeah.

06:04.646 --> 06:08.902
Look, Chloe, uh, you need to
go talk to Chappelle.

06:08.998 --> 06:12.166
- For what?
- You know what for.

06:23.494 --> 06:25.926
- Kim Bauer.
- Did you get a chance to update the logs?

06:26.022 --> 06:28.710
Most of them. Look, what's going on
with my dad and Chase?

06:28.806 --> 06:31.430
That's why I called.
Uh, they're headed back to Los Angeles.

06:31.526 --> 06:34.309
- They lost Amador. We're looking for him now.
- What about Nina?

06:34.405 --> 06:37.381
- They're bringing her back with them.
- Thank you, Tony.

06:37.477 --> 06:39.237
All right. You got it.

06:47.557 --> 06:50.405
I'd love nothing more,
but we have to prioritize, don't we?

06:50.502 --> 06:53.318
- " I understand."
- "All right. Yeah."

06:53.414 --> 06:56.197
All right. I gotta go.

06:56.293 --> 06:59.365
Tony said you wanted to
talk to me. Here I am.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.478
- Sit down.
- If you want me to talk about the baby...

07:01.573 --> 07:03.590
you're wasting your time,
because I'm not gonna talk about her.

07:03.685 --> 07:07.333
So, sit down. Tell me
what the hell's going on.

07:09.605 --> 07:12.613
- What?
- All right.

07:12.710 --> 07:16.004
First, you told us the baby was yours.
We found out that was a lie.

07:16.101 --> 07:18.949
Then, you tell us you and your boyfriend
took it from its mother...

07:19.045 --> 07:21.413
because the baby
was being abused.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.357
I did say that, and I'd like to
correct that right now.

07:26.214 --> 07:28.358
I don't have a boyfriend.

07:28.453 --> 07:31.525
You're unbelievable.

07:33.030 --> 07:37.220
- Who does the baby belong to?
- I can't tell you.

07:37.317 --> 07:40.196
You brought an unauthorized person into
this building. That's a federal offense.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.781
- It's just a baby.
- I don't care who it is. You're in violation.

07:45.733 --> 07:50.757
- Fine. I'm in violation.
- Who does the baby belong to, Chloe?

07:53.189 --> 07:56.390
Do you want me to take it down to
the lab and run blood tests to get an I. D?

07:56.486 --> 07:59.045
- 'Cause I will.
- I'm not gonna talk anymore about this baby.

07:59.140 --> 08:02.629
And it's not because I'm a horrible, evil person.
It's just because I can't do it.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.613
Just please don't start
sticking needles in her.

08:12.357 --> 08:14.949
- Eileen.
- Yes, Mr. Chappelle.

08:15.045 --> 08:18.916
Send Security in. I want Chloe O'Brian under
guard while we run some tests on the baby.

08:19.012 --> 08:21.060
Right away, sir.

08:21.156 --> 08:23.781
Tony Almeida from C.T.U.
Has just informed us...

08:23.876 --> 08:28.548
that they were unable to confiscate
this Cordilla virus in Mexico.

08:28.645 --> 08:32.133
I thought they located the seller
and had the entire area surrounded.

08:32.229 --> 08:35.078
Well, the seller,
a man named Michael Amador...

08:35.173 --> 08:37.605
apparently, he never
intended to give up the virus.

08:37.701 --> 08:39.844
In fact,
it was a well-planned rip-off.

08:39.940 --> 08:44.676
David, we lost six men.
Members of a Delta team.

08:44.804 --> 08:47.620
We lost a Delta team?

08:47.717 --> 08:50.629
This man, Amador, where is he now?

08:50.725 --> 08:54.021
The latest working theory is Amador has this
virus and is headed back here to Los Angeles.

08:54.148 --> 08:55.781
- To release it?
- We don't know...

08:55.877 --> 08:58.501
but Amador doesn't have a history of
implementing terrorist strikes.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.708
He's an arms dealer
with no known ideology.

09:00.805 --> 09:05.540
- Bottom line is we just don't know
what his intentions are.

09:05.668 --> 09:08.964
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.
I finally reached Sherry Palmer.

09:09.061 --> 09:10.948
- Is she on the line now?
- Yes, sir.

09:12.581 --> 09:14.149
Continue here, Wayne.

09:21.124 --> 09:22.564
Sherry.

09:22.660 --> 09:25.829
I'm sorry I couldn't call you back.
I had to leave Kelly's in a hurry.

09:25.924 --> 09:27.845
Did you talk to him
after we spoke?

09:27.940 --> 09:31.941
- That's just it. When I got back there, he was gone.
- Gone?

09:32.036 --> 09:34.404
- Do you think he ran?
- No, I don't...

09:34.533 --> 09:38.181
because he was more than ready and willing
to come forward against Milliken.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.099
But someone obviously
got to him first.

09:40.196 --> 09:43.940
- But you didn't see anyone?
- No, I ran back to my car and got out of there.

09:44.036 --> 09:46.884
I was, uh... I was
pretty scared there, David.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.828
Milliken must be on to you.
Get back here as soon as you can.

09:49.924 --> 09:54.500
- It's not safe for you out there anymore.
- I need to do something first.

09:54.596 --> 09:57.444
- "What?"
- I'm going to go see Julia Milliken.

09:57.573 --> 10:01.155
No. No. I don't want you to go anywhere
near her or Alan tonight.

10:01.252 --> 10:04.580
I have to, David. Alan Milliken
had to move fast...

10:04.708 --> 10:07.076
in order to kidnap... maybe even kill...
this Kevin Kelly guy.

10:07.172 --> 10:10.564
I've gotta take advantage of that
before he has time to cover his tracks.

10:10.661 --> 10:13.284
Sherry, I do not
want you confronting Alan.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.029
I told you, David.
I'm just going to talk to Julia.

10:17.124 --> 10:18.980
I promise.
I'll stay away from Alan.

10:19.076 --> 10:23.363
- Sherry...
- David, you asked me to help you, right?

10:23.460 --> 10:26.084
Please, let me do that.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.868
- What happened back there?
- She wants to help us find Amador.

10:40.964 --> 10:43.044
Agent Bauer,
Mike Murphy, Delta 4.

10:43.139 --> 10:47.107
- The navy was good enough to reroute a C-130.
- Tell them we said thank you.

10:47.204 --> 10:50.052
We're gonna take you and the prisoner
back to Los Angeles.

10:50.148 --> 10:54.180
- Any movement on Amador?
- No. Air Tactical's been monitoring
the entire area.

10:54.276 --> 10:56.868
- So far, nothing.
- Jack, you sure you wanna leave?

10:56.964 --> 10:58.820
- Secure her.
- "Yes, sir."

10:58.916 --> 11:01.764
Amador's already gone.
He's planned this thing well.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.867
We need to find who wants the virus
and where and when they're gonna release it.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.492
We need to go now.
We need to leave.

11:11.139 --> 11:12.963
Let's go. Let's clear this up.

11:30.627 --> 11:32.323
- Hello?
- Marcus, it's me.

11:32.420 --> 11:36.676
- Where are you?
- I'll be there in an hour.

11:36.804 --> 11:40.228
- You got the virus?
- Yes. Just be ready.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.811
I will be.

12:12.035 --> 12:15.076
- Hello?
- Julia, I'm almost there.

12:15.171 --> 12:17.859
- Where's Alan now?
- He's in his room.

12:17.956 --> 12:20.707
- Is he asleep?
- No. He just got off the phone with someone.

12:20.804 --> 12:23.076
Do you know who he was talking to?
Did you hear a name?

12:23.172 --> 12:27.299
- No. No.
- How do I get to you without him knowing?

12:29.091 --> 12:31.235
The gate code is 41-32.

12:31.332 --> 12:35.588
Park off to the side and walk up to
the service porch.

12:35.716 --> 12:38.755
- I'll be there.
- All right. W-What's that number again?

12:38.852 --> 12:41.155
- "41-32."
- Okay.

12:41.252 --> 12:43.076
- Are there any security cameras?
- "Yes."

12:43.171 --> 12:46.434
- Make sure they're disabled.
- Sherry, I don't know if I can.

12:46.531 --> 12:48.099
Find a way, Julia.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.355
I'll be there in a few minutes.

13:08.226 --> 13:11.107
Strongest opponent is
ahead in the polls and gaining favor...

13:11.202 --> 13:13.026
with the American people.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.331
- "As for President Palmer..."
- You're up late.

13:17.347 --> 13:21.603
Ken called from Singapore.

13:21.731 --> 13:25.187
He still hasn't figured out
how to calculate the time difference.

13:26.883 --> 13:30.114
- You should be in bed yourself.
- I will.

13:30.211 --> 13:32.867
I just put on some tea.
I'd like to settle my stomach.

13:32.962 --> 13:36.995
- All right, then.
- All right.

13:43.395 --> 13:45.923
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:49.922 --> 13:52.578
Julia.

13:52.675 --> 13:58.147
I know you felt demeaned earlier,
but that's behind us now.

13:58.242 --> 14:00.611
I know it is.

14:26.019 --> 14:28.099
I let you live.
Tell me what you know.

14:31.650 --> 14:36.002
Anytime Amador does business
on the West Coast, he washes his deal
through a man named Alvers.

14:36.098 --> 14:38.467
Alvers. What's his first name?

14:38.562 --> 14:42.019
All I know is Alvers.
It could be a first or last name.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.547
How does Amador contact this Alvers?

14:44.642 --> 14:48.227
I don't know. I've never met him. But I did
check out Amador before our deal...

14:48.322 --> 14:50.146
and I kept coming across
the name Alvers.

14:50.242 --> 14:53.346
He was a connector to a lot of his past deals.
Los Angeles was always the hub.

14:53.442 --> 14:57.026
- "Who's in charge of transportation? Okay."
- Chase, you on with C.T. U?

14:57.123 --> 15:00.418
- Yeah, it's Tony.
- Tell him I wanna speak to him.

15:00.546 --> 15:02.274
Tony, Jack wants to talk to you.

15:04.866 --> 15:06.690
- Tony.
- Hey, Jack.

15:06.787 --> 15:08.611
I want you to run a check
on the name Alvers.

15:08.707 --> 15:12.353
- Cross-reference it with everything that
you've got on Amador.
- Is that it?

15:12.450 --> 15:15.266
Yeah, just the name.
Alvers. A-L-V-E-R-S.

15:15.362 --> 15:17.410
- You got this from Nina?
- Yeah.

15:17.506 --> 15:20.579
- All right. I'll work it up. I'll get back to you.
- Okay. Thanks.

15:30.819 --> 15:32.802
Keep it.

15:35.074 --> 15:38.082
- How's the hand?
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

15:40.354 --> 15:44.354
You and I have been through a lot today.
Why don't we move past it and do our job?

15:44.450 --> 15:48.163
You don't trust me, Jack. Why didn't you
tell me about your deal with Hector?

15:48.258 --> 15:51.554
It couldn't go beyond Gael, Tony and myself.
That's the only way I knew I could contain it.

15:51.649 --> 15:54.785
What'd you think? That I wasn't going
to come after you and Ramon?

15:56.642 --> 15:58.754
I didn't know whether to
save you or kill you.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.802
I expected you
to follow my orders.

16:04.002 --> 16:06.146
But I probably would have
done the same thing myself.

16:06.242 --> 16:09.954
You put a gun to my head,
and you pulled the trigger.

16:10.050 --> 16:13.665
I made a judgment call that Ramon Salazar
would not give me a loaded weapon.

16:13.762 --> 16:16.770
- That he was testing me.
- And if it was loaded?

16:16.866 --> 16:20.706
- "Then what?"
- I'd have finished my mission.

16:20.834 --> 16:24.834
Chase, listen to me. You do this job long
enough, you're gonna have to make choices.

16:24.930 --> 16:28.706
You don't know you've made the right one
until the whole scenario plays itself out.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.754
Right now,
the only thing that matters...

16:30.882 --> 16:33.538
is if we don't stop this virus, the world
as we know it will change forever.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.554
And that fact...
and that fact alone...

16:35.682 --> 16:39.618
is the only thing that you have to keep in
the front of your mind, and you know that.

16:41.090 --> 16:44.002
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:44.097 --> 16:48.706
Why don't you keep pressing her?
She probably hasn't told you everything.

16:48.801 --> 16:54.209
No, she probably hasn't. We're gonna have to
wait, make sure Alvers is a real lead.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.441
Over a thousand Alvers showed up in the
Langley database. I did background checks...

17:05.538 --> 17:08.801
and consistency refs with Amador:
This is the only one that red-flagged.

17:08.897 --> 17:12.066
Marcus Alvers. Born in Austria,
moved to England.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.656
Met Amador in Cambridge,
where Alvers was studying biology.

17:14.752 --> 17:18.786
In 1994, they were suspected
of manufacturing weapons-grade anthrax...

17:18.881 --> 17:23.073
- "but there was no hard evidence."
- All right. Sounds like this is our guy.

17:23.170 --> 17:26.178
The dossier's sketchy, but Alvers
and Amador have definitely crossed paths.

17:26.272 --> 17:28.162
C.I.A. Had these on file.

17:28.258 --> 17:32.481
Over the past three years, there've been
14 sightings of Alvers and Amador together...

17:32.578 --> 17:34.242
- "throughout Europe and East Africa."
- All right.

17:34.338 --> 17:38.721
- So, how do we find Alvers?
- We have some threads.
We need to work them all up.

17:38.817 --> 17:41.345
- "We're gonna need manpower from Division."
- "Michelle, hook him up."

17:49.025 --> 17:52.322
This is Bauer.

17:52.450 --> 17:56.417
Yeah, Jack, we got a match on Alvers.
Now we gotta find him. It's gonna take time.

17:56.512 --> 17:58.817
Yeah, I'll see what
we can do from here.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.737
We're on.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.785
- Looks like the information
you gave us on Alvers is real.
- Of course it is.

18:06.881 --> 18:10.785
C.T.U.'s not gonna find him before his
meeting with Amador. But I can help you.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.337
- How?
- "I know a little more than I said I did."

18:14.433 --> 18:16.801
Look, I know there's no time
for a signed deal...

18:16.897 --> 18:19.617
so I'm gonna trust you're gonna support
my case with the Department of Justice...

18:19.712 --> 18:21.761
if I help you secure this virus.

18:21.857 --> 18:24.545
You've got my word.

18:24.641 --> 18:27.745
The man's name is
Marcus Frederick Alvers.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.145
He's an amateur biologist
and wannabe terrorist.

18:30.241 --> 18:33.665
He raised hell from Vienna to Los Angeles
with a two-year stop in London.

18:33.761 --> 18:36.928
I have a number for him.

18:37.025 --> 18:40.736
You have to dial a Felco prefix first. Then
you can reach him through an Internet socket.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.040
Give me the cold line.

18:50.657 --> 18:53.633
What's the number?

18:53.729 --> 18:57.664
It's 1-7-7-5-5-3-1.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.905
You're gonna get a fast busy signal,
but don't hang up.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.560
I've got the busy signal.

19:02.656 --> 19:04.512
Hit nine and hold it for three seconds.

19:09.313 --> 19:12.609
Did you get a tone?

19:12.736 --> 19:15.489
Yeah, I've got a tone.

19:15.585 --> 19:19.008
Hit 9-5-7-3-1-star-6.

19:24.128 --> 19:26.304
It's ringing.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.729
When the ringing stops, you're gonna get
a series of numbers. That's your I.P. Address.

19:32.353 --> 19:35.393
It stopped ringing.

19:37.537 --> 19:42.881
- I'm not getting any numbers.
- That's okay. Just wait.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.937
Yeah?

19:56.033 --> 19:58.017
The tech room is spiking
all over the place.

19:58.112 --> 20:00.896
- Can you reset it from there?
- "I don't know. I'll have to get back to you."

20:00.992 --> 20:04.224
Adam, what's going on?
My system's locked.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.168
Division. Tech.

20:07.264 --> 20:10.112
- Matt, it's Adam at C.T.U.
- Adam, look. We don't know what's going on.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.577
We're blocked up here too.
I'll have to get back to you.

20:17.184 --> 20:21.536
Don't need to dial it again, Jack.
Once was enough.

20:21.632 --> 20:24.480
- What are you talking about?
- You just triggered a worm...

20:24.576 --> 20:26.784
that's gonna bring down
agency connectivity.

20:29.344 --> 20:31.616
My God, what have you done?

20:31.712 --> 20:33.921
What have you done?

20:34.016 --> 20:37.761
Until I say otherwise, your entire
antiterrorist computer network is jammed.

20:37.856 --> 20:41.951
Listen up! We've got some kind of
self-propagating code leaking into the system.

20:42.048 --> 20:45.504
Shut down your sockets. Save everything you
can. We're gonna find where this thing came from.

21:05.535 --> 21:09.120
- What do you mean Nina did this?
- She knew our system better than anyone.

21:09.216 --> 21:11.712
She embedded a worm in a driver
she knew we'd never upgrade.

21:11.808 --> 21:13.312
- She told you this?
- Yes!

21:13.408 --> 21:16.352
- What does she want?
- "I don't know. We're gonna"
find out soon enough.

21:16.448 --> 21:18.144
Look. Can your people
stop this thing?

21:18.240 --> 21:22.111
- We're doing our best.
- Pull Chloe. She knows the network
better than anyone.

21:22.207 --> 21:24.864
That's a problem.
She's been asked to step aside.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.295
- What are you talking about? Why?
- It's a long story, Jack.

21:27.392 --> 21:29.599
This is not the time
to take Chloe out of play.

21:29.696 --> 21:33.376
You know as well as I do how many terrorist
cells try to hack into our system every day.

21:33.472 --> 21:37.120
If this thing eats through our fire walls, we're
gonna have agents as targets by morning.

21:37.216 --> 21:40.000
What about Nina? Any way you can get her
to tell us how to neutralize this thing?

21:40.096 --> 21:42.815
- I'll start working on it. I'll get back to you.
- All right.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.199
- What do you want?
- Turn the plane around and head back to Mexico.

21:47.328 --> 21:50.239
Once you do, I'll slow down
the spread of the worm.

21:50.335 --> 21:52.864
When we land and I'm safely away,
I'll give you the final kill code.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.751
- That'll never happen.
- "How many terrorist cells..."

21:54.848 --> 21:57.472
are waiting
for a window like this?

21:57.568 --> 22:00.544
A couple hundred? In 30 minutes, they'll all
have access to C.T.U. Files everywhere.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.231
You don't want that to happen.
Turn the plane around.

22:03.327 --> 22:06.335
- You're assuming our people can't stop this thing.
- I invite you to try.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.087
Believe me, Ryan, I know.

22:17.184 --> 22:20.223
But Chloe's the only person who knows enough
about this section of code to stop the worm.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.456
Fine.

22:23.552 --> 22:27.039
- Steve, you can go.
- Yes, sir.

22:27.135 --> 22:29.856
- What's happening?
- There's a worm eating through our network.

22:29.951 --> 22:33.536
Nina Myers somehow managed to launch it
remotely, and it's running rampant in the kernel.

22:33.631 --> 22:35.871
Tony says you can stop it.
Is that correct?

22:35.968 --> 22:38.271
Yeah, if it hasn't destroyed
too much of the routing data.

22:38.368 --> 22:40.192
Good. Do it.

22:48.095 --> 22:50.879
- Adam, did you close all the gateways?
- Yeah.

22:50.975 --> 22:52.415
- Reopen 12 and 14.
- "What for?"

22:52.543 --> 22:55.040
They won't leak with the rest,
and they get us to the kernel.

22:55.135 --> 22:56.703
Dalton, start pinging
the nodes in I.T.

22:56.799 --> 22:59.327
When you stop getting
packet loss, freeze the process.

22:59.424 --> 23:02.272
- I'll be in the tech room.
- All right.

24:36.798 --> 24:39.711
I'm really not comfortable
with you being here, Sherry.

24:39.807 --> 24:42.878
- So why don't you just tell me what you want.
- Oh, come on, Julia.

24:42.975 --> 24:45.311
I told you earlier. I know about your marriage.
I know about your life.

24:45.407 --> 24:47.775
I know that you'd rather
be with a man you love...

24:47.871 --> 24:51.518
but you stay with Alan because of
his money and the security.

24:51.614 --> 24:55.487
I don't need a drive-through shrink, so unless
you have some real reason to be here...

24:55.614 --> 24:57.662
How about murder?

24:59.327 --> 25:01.374
What are you talking about?

25:01.471 --> 25:06.206
A man named Kevin Kelly has information
on Alan that could hurt him very badly.

25:06.334 --> 25:09.342
- An hour ago, Kelly disappeared.
- Disappeared?

25:09.438 --> 25:12.894
- It's possible he was killed.
- And you think Alan is involved?

25:12.990 --> 25:16.766
Oh, sweetie, I know Alan is involved.
And you're gonna help me prove it.

25:16.894 --> 25:20.414
Even if I could do that, why would I?

25:20.511 --> 25:22.399
Because it's your ticket out of here.

25:22.495 --> 25:27.102
If Alan goes to prison,
you get everything, Julia.

25:35.006 --> 25:37.118
What would you need me to do?

25:37.214 --> 25:41.982
Okay. First, I need you to find out what
phone calls he's made in the past two hours.

25:42.110 --> 25:43.871
Alan makes all his calls
behind closed doors.

25:43.966 --> 25:46.238
- Does he use the house phone?
- His cell.

25:46.334 --> 25:49.054
He usually keeps it with him.
It makes things easier with his wheelchair.

25:49.150 --> 25:52.638
- Where is the cell phone now?
- In his room.

25:52.733 --> 25:54.942
- I need you to get that phone.
- N-No.

25:55.038 --> 25:57.438
Alan just went to bed.
I'm not even sure he's asleep yet.

25:57.566 --> 26:01.790
- Well, then, why don't you find out?
- I can't.

26:01.886 --> 26:04.862
Don't you want to be free of him?

26:04.958 --> 26:07.134
I'm afraid.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.078
Well, I'm not.

26:10.175 --> 26:11.998
Where's the bedroom?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.349
Set the group permission
on the beta node to 5-7-7...

27:20.446 --> 27:22.814
and make it recursive
all the way down the tree.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.982
I want anyone who's on the cypher volume
to stay off until I'm done.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.997
- " Okay."
- Adam, are those gateways open?

27:28.126 --> 27:31.902
- Yeah, of course.
- I'm trying to see the virus definition.

27:31.997 --> 27:35.357
- I hope you have enough to go on.
- We'll know in a minute.

27:35.485 --> 27:39.037
It's sad that I have to do this knowing that
you and Kim stabbed me in the back.

27:39.133 --> 27:40.989
What do you want me to do, Chloe?

27:41.085 --> 27:44.797
When you're breaking rules
and then lying about it all over the place?

27:44.894 --> 27:47.742
- Tell me what you'd do.
- I'd have a little faith in my fellow worker.

27:47.837 --> 27:50.493
No, you'd follow protocol.
You're the biggest rule-freak of anyone.

27:50.590 --> 27:54.013
I think I've done a pretty good job
at breaking the rules...

27:54.109 --> 27:57.149
- trying to protect a friend
and that baby... wouldn't you say?
- What friend?

27:57.245 --> 28:01.373
It's done.

28:01.469 --> 28:04.221
- Damn it.
- It didn't work?

28:04.317 --> 28:06.461
- The worm's speeding up.
- " How is that possible?"

28:06.557 --> 28:08.701
We must've triggered something.
Open one and four.

28:08.798 --> 28:11.997
- Won't that expose the kernel?
- Yeah, but we have no choice. Do it!

28:19.932 --> 28:22.461
- " O-7?"
- No, 4-7.

28:22.557 --> 28:25.693
Yes, and the last one
on here has a 206 area code.

28:25.789 --> 28:29.821
- " Washington?"
- Yeah, that's 555-0191.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.741
That's it?

28:31.838 --> 28:34.173
Okay. Oh, and Brian?
Thank you so much.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.477
- You okay?
- Yeah, just call me.

28:36.572 --> 28:39.069
All right.

28:39.165 --> 28:41.533
- What are you doing?
- I have someone who could track the calls...

28:41.629 --> 28:45.277
that Alan made from this phone, and if
any of them can be connected to Kelly...

28:45.373 --> 28:47.069
we have evidence that
we can use against Alan.

28:47.165 --> 28:49.053
- What should I do?
- Nothing.

28:49.149 --> 28:51.677
Absolutely nothing.
Just go to bed...

28:51.774 --> 28:54.302
and as far as you're concerned,
nothing happened here.

28:57.948 --> 29:01.245
Julia, why aren't you in bed?
Who are you talking to?

29:02.876 --> 29:06.909
- Sherry?
- Hello, Alan.

29:08.957 --> 29:12.221
- Julia, I'm disappointed in you.
- I didn't ask her here.

29:12.317 --> 29:16.029
But you let her in, and you took
my cell phone as well.

29:16.125 --> 29:18.460
No. I took the phone.

29:20.380 --> 29:25.053
So what do you think
you're going to do, Sherry?

29:25.149 --> 29:28.253
Stop me?
That's not likely.

29:28.348 --> 29:33.085
All right. You wanna talk about this
in the open? Fine.

29:35.485 --> 29:37.404
What happened to Kevin Kelly?

29:37.532 --> 29:41.180
Kevin Kelly. The name rings a bell.

29:41.276 --> 29:45.053
Well, it should ring a bell. He's the man
that saw you run over his daughter...

29:45.180 --> 29:46.781
and kill her 12 years ago.

29:46.876 --> 29:50.493
The man you paid a considerable amount
of money to keep quiet.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.828
And the man
you made disappear tonight.

29:54.877 --> 29:57.565
So why don't you chew on that a bit...

29:57.661 --> 30:00.156
and maybe we can talk about it
a little more tomorrow?

30:00.252 --> 30:05.596
Or we can end it now,
and you can back off David.

30:15.325 --> 30:17.692
- Yeah, this is Bauer.
- Chloe O'Brian for you, sir.

30:17.789 --> 30:20.156
- Fine. Patch her through.
- Yes, sir.

30:23.164 --> 30:25.372
I understand the system's going down.

30:25.468 --> 30:28.316
Have you tried all security codes?

30:29.692 --> 30:32.540
What do you suggest?

30:32.636 --> 30:34.845
Nina, I've heard all about you.

30:34.940 --> 30:38.717
I know what you've done, and how you've
managed to stay alive is impressive.

30:38.845 --> 30:41.820
But if you try
to play Jack one more time...

30:41.916 --> 30:43.932
he's gonna kill you.

30:46.076 --> 30:48.092
Is that so?

30:49.308 --> 30:51.036
Yeah.

30:57.469 --> 31:00.411
I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

31:00.507 --> 31:03.676
In about three minutes,
our entire system's gonna be down.

31:03.771 --> 31:06.780
You want any leverage, you better start
telling me how to stop this thing now.

31:06.876 --> 31:08.924
- Doesn't move that fast, Jack.
- You're wrong.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.100
Chloe, put it up on the screen.

31:11.196 --> 31:15.772
We're running out of time, Nina,
to cut a deal. Explain it to her, Chloe.

31:15.868 --> 31:18.460
When I tried to separate the routers on
the East Coast, the worm speed tripled.

31:18.557 --> 31:22.011
- Who is this?
- Chloe O'Brian. My network
monitor's up. What do I do?

31:26.204 --> 31:29.628
Log in with user I.D.
C-l-S-2-7-A.

31:31.132 --> 31:33.692
- It's asking for a security level.
- Hit "Escape 6."

31:33.788 --> 31:35.708
- That's it?
- Yes.

31:35.836 --> 31:38.684
- " Chloe, did that stop it?"
- No.

31:38.812 --> 31:41.915
Wait a minute.
It didn't stop, but it's slowing down.

31:42.012 --> 31:45.116
- How much time do we have?
- "Our simulation says just over 20 minutes."

31:45.211 --> 31:47.516
I'll get back to you.

31:47.611 --> 31:50.844
I slowed it down. Now you need to turn
the plane around and head back to Mexico.

31:50.940 --> 31:55.131
If you don't, you can expect your undercover
agents around the world to start dying.

31:55.228 --> 31:59.004
You're going to Los Angeles, help me
find Amador, then you're going to prison.

31:59.132 --> 32:03.675
That's what's happening here.

32:05.371 --> 32:09.148
You come into my house?
After everything I've done for your family?

32:09.243 --> 32:12.892
I've made your children's father
the president of the United States!

32:12.988 --> 32:17.595
You wait a minute. Whatever you did to help
David was not for the benefit of my children.

32:17.692 --> 32:20.988
Let's get that straight. You're just
a small man, Alan, who lords his money...

32:21.116 --> 32:23.611
over his friends because that's all you have...
that's all you are.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.003
Why do you think your wife
had to go out and find another man?

32:27.131 --> 32:30.587
- Don't you talk to me like this!
- Because you're not one!

32:30.683 --> 32:35.419
Not one woman in her right mind would find
you attractive without your wealth, Alan!

32:35.547 --> 32:37.916
That's what people want from you.

32:38.044 --> 32:41.148
That's all Julia wants from you.
And I'm supposed to be afraid of you?

32:41.244 --> 32:44.315
You think I'm scared of you?
You're just a little boy!

32:44.411 --> 32:46.971
A pathetic, scrawny,
sickly little boy!

32:47.067 --> 32:49.595
Julia, my pills. My pills!

32:52.315 --> 32:54.108
- No, don't!
- What are you doing?

32:54.203 --> 32:55.676
- Don't!
- Sherry.

32:55.804 --> 32:57.692
- Don't.
- "Julia!"

32:57.788 --> 33:00.188
- Julia!
- This is your way out.

33:01.468 --> 33:04.315
Julia!

33:04.443 --> 33:07.131
Julia!

33:07.227 --> 33:09.627
Julia!

33:43.131 --> 33:45.210
All right.
I can't stay here, Julia.

33:46.074 --> 33:48.315
- We killed him.
- No. No. No. No one killed him.

33:48.411 --> 33:51.547
- We watched him die.
- It's over, Julia.

33:51.643 --> 33:53.371
- We watched him die!
- Shh!

33:55.450 --> 33:58.235
Now Alan was a sick little man.

33:58.331 --> 34:01.692
And his weak body gave out.
Nobody was around to help him.

34:01.819 --> 34:03.836
And you... you were in the bedroom,
understand me?

34:03.931 --> 34:07.227
You're free of him, sweetie.
That's all you need to think about.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.931
There's one thing you're gonna have to be
really clear about.

34:12.027 --> 34:14.907
When the authorities
come around questioning you...

34:15.034 --> 34:17.370
this was an accident.

34:19.867 --> 34:23.547
- I don't think I can do this...
- You don't have a choice...

34:23.643 --> 34:27.706
unless you wanna spend the rest of
your pretty little life in prison.

34:27.802 --> 34:31.737
Oh, God.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.659
All right.
You go into your bedroom.

34:33.754 --> 34:35.866
You stay there for about an hour.

34:35.963 --> 34:39.675
Then you're gonna come out
for a glass of water.

34:39.771 --> 34:42.106
Then you're gonna...
see the body.

34:42.203 --> 34:44.955
Now that's your story.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.954
- Who do I call?
- 911.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.523
That's what you would
naturally do, right? Okay.

34:58.650 --> 35:02.267
- What about you?
- Now, you listen. You listen real strong...

35:02.363 --> 35:04.091
'cause this is very crucial.

35:04.187 --> 35:09.754
If anyone suspects that I was here,
there will be an investigation...

35:09.850 --> 35:12.890
and both of us will go to prison.

35:15.355 --> 35:19.899
I was never here.
You understand me?

35:23.674 --> 35:28.954
Julia, you tell me right now
that you understand what I'm saying.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.658
I understand.

35:33.754 --> 35:35.674
Okay.

35:53.722 --> 35:56.346
Damn it.
Stop that process. It's making it worse.

35:56.442 --> 35:58.331
- " Chloe, what's going on?"
- I'm not getting it.

35:58.426 --> 36:00.346
- What's it going to take?
- "I don't know."

36:00.475 --> 36:03.194
If you can't stop this worm, then I have to
tell Jack to reroute that plane...

36:03.291 --> 36:06.267
- to wherever Nina wants.
- Tony, please let me work.

36:06.362 --> 36:09.946
This is Bauer.

36:10.041 --> 36:12.826
- Jack.
- Tell me your people
have got a handle on this thing.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.354
- We don't.
- Well, Nina's not gonna give us the kill code...

36:15.482 --> 36:18.490
until we turn the plane around back to Mexico,
and I have no intention of doing that.

36:18.586 --> 36:21.434
We don't have a choice.
Tell the pilot to reroute the plane now.

36:21.530 --> 36:24.954
- We have to do whatever it takes
to stop this thing.
- That's not an alternative.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.386
"Tony. Tony!"

36:27.483 --> 36:29.530
Son of a bitch.

36:29.627 --> 36:33.594
Once the damage is done, you're not gonna be
able to cut a deal. Give me the kill code now.

36:33.690 --> 36:35.641
Jack.

36:39.674 --> 36:42.138
- What?
- Think about it.

36:42.234 --> 36:45.434
You should give her what she wants
right now. It's not worth it.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.354
We'll deal with her later.

36:47.450 --> 36:50.970
Jack, if you turn the plane around,
I can slow this thing down even more.

36:51.065 --> 36:55.194
But I'm not giving you the kill code
till I'm safe in Mexico.

36:55.289 --> 36:57.657
What's going on?

36:57.754 --> 37:00.953
- We're going back up.
- Son of a bitch.

37:03.994 --> 37:07.290
- What are you doing?
- I just got orders from Agent Almeida not to land.

37:07.418 --> 37:09.530
He said to take
the plane back to Mexico.

37:09.626 --> 37:11.258
- "Land the plane now!"
- I got my orders.

37:14.585 --> 37:17.305
Don't even think about it.
Land the plane!

37:17.402 --> 37:19.674
What the hell is he doing?

37:23.289 --> 37:25.370
What's going on? Why aren't you
turning this plane around?

37:25.466 --> 37:27.673
- Bauer won't let me.
- What do you mean he won't let you?

37:27.770 --> 37:32.057
- He's got a gun on me.
- Put me on speaker.

37:32.185 --> 37:36.025
- Jack, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you, Tony.
We're landing in Los Angeles.

37:36.153 --> 37:39.322
We need that kill code. Tell the pilot
to turn the plane around right now.

37:39.417 --> 37:42.266
- That's an order from Division.
- We can't keep giving in to her.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.378
Wait a minute!
I think I'm getting something.

37:44.505 --> 37:46.970
I can't take that chance.
We have to stop this thing...

37:47.066 --> 37:48.889
or agents are going
to wind up dead.

37:48.986 --> 37:52.058
- Then our people are going to have to stop it.
- We don't have the time.

37:52.154 --> 37:53.977
Turning the plane around
is not going to help.

37:54.073 --> 37:56.377
It's gonna take us farther away
from where we need to be.

37:56.473 --> 37:58.297
- Chloe...
- Please, shut up, Tony.

37:58.393 --> 38:00.729
- Dalton, bring it back up to 50.
- Okay, I'm clear.

38:00.825 --> 38:02.713
- I'm clear.
- What branches?

38:02.809 --> 38:04.058
- 14 through 20.
- Dalton?

38:04.153 --> 38:05.306
It's working.

38:05.401 --> 38:07.801
- Are we okay?
- I can't tell.

38:07.929 --> 38:10.777
Yeah. Here. Here.
It's coming back up.

38:10.874 --> 38:13.624
No, stop! Stop the process!

38:13.721 --> 38:15.385
It's cycling through.
It's almost back up.

38:15.481 --> 38:17.177
It's a defensive ploy
built into the worm.

38:17.273 --> 38:19.225
It's not what we thought.
It's a simple back pop virus.

38:19.353 --> 38:23.641
- I just took out the resource for it.
- Look at the C.P.U. It's 100%.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.873
- What you're seeing on the monitor isn't real.
- Do what she says.

38:26.970 --> 38:30.074
All right. It's stopped.

38:32.409 --> 38:34.840
- What's going on?
- I think it's resetting itself.

38:41.593 --> 38:44.409
We got it.

38:46.841 --> 38:48.730
- Jack.
- Yeah?

38:48.825 --> 38:50.521
- We're back up.
- Fully functional?

38:50.617 --> 38:54.394
- Fully functional.
- We're resuming our approach. Good work.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.416
You can file a report
with your commanding officer.

39:09.689 --> 39:12.505
All our systems are up and running.

39:14.425 --> 39:18.553
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.

39:36.472 --> 39:38.840
Let's check our directories
and make sure we haven't lost anything.

39:38.968 --> 39:40.952
I'm on it. What about
the network volumes?

39:41.081 --> 39:45.337
Let's remount those six at a time
until they're all on.

39:45.465 --> 39:47.609
These all look good.
Dalton, how about yours?

39:47.705 --> 39:50.329
There's some dropout, but it'll self-adjust
in the next 10 minutes.

39:50.425 --> 39:54.617
Great work today, Chloe. You averted
what could have been a major loss.

39:54.713 --> 39:57.433
- I know. Are Jack and Chase coming back soon?
- Yeah.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.129
- Good.
- Where you going?

39:59.224 --> 40:01.817
- Back upstairs.
- No.

40:01.912 --> 40:06.456
This whole thing with the baby
isn't going to just go away.

40:06.552 --> 40:10.073
What you did here will certainly bear well on
your case, but the charges still stand.

40:10.169 --> 40:12.345
We're handing you over to L.A.P.D.

40:12.441 --> 40:16.633
And no matter what happens, you're going to
have to tell them who this baby belongs to.

40:16.729 --> 40:18.904
Who's that?
Where are they taking Angela?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.496
Child Protective Services
has custody of her now.

40:21.592 --> 40:23.865
- Oh, no. They can't do that.
- Of course they can.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.936
- Uh, Child Services, hold on.
- Chloe, what are you doing?

40:27.032 --> 40:29.592
I'll tell you who the father is.

40:36.345 --> 40:38.392
Don't ask me who the mother is.
I don't know.

40:38.488 --> 40:40.632
I was doing a favor.
I swear I'm telling the truth.

40:40.728 --> 40:44.665
Barb, we're going to
hold on to her a little longer.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.312
We just got
some more information.

40:48.408 --> 40:50.617
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

40:50.712 --> 40:53.465
He didn't want me to tell anyone.
I was trying to be a friend.

40:53.561 --> 40:55.928
Sorry.

41:00.759 --> 41:04.408
- Chloe, I heard you stopped the worm.
- Yeah, I did.

41:04.504 --> 41:07.993
- Your dad and Chase are back in L.A.
You must be relieved.
- Yes. Thank you.

41:08.088 --> 41:10.232
- Look, Chloe, what about the baby?
- What about her?

41:10.328 --> 41:13.817
- Well, I thought they were pressing charges.
- That was a misunderstanding.

41:13.912 --> 41:15.769
- Chloe, wait.
- What?

41:15.864 --> 41:18.552
- So they're not pressing charges?
- No.

41:18.649 --> 41:23.064
- Why not?
- I told them who the father was. Everything's okay.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.856
Wait. Everything's okay?
Wh-Who's the father?

41:29.400 --> 41:30.800
Chase.
