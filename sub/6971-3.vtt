11:35.529 --> 11:37.565
Someone who?
LUCY: I’m not sure, D’avin.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.863
But we can no longer
control my course.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.199
We can't slow down
or navigate, Dutch.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.581
lfwe can't get
Lucy’s thrusters
back online,

11:53.672 --> 11:55.458
it's just a matter of time
before we collide with
something.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.789
Shitballs.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.590
LUCY: I’m also on fire
in the engine room.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.384
Flaming shitballs.
l'll head down there.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.382
No, no, no. You stay
and monitor the course.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.259
I'll go with Johnny.
No, we should all help.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.638
No, you stay.
We need you here.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.718
Okay.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.147
DUTCH: Johnny?
We need to talk.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.943
Oh, shit. Is that
angry-looking ball
of energy a good sign?

12:26.038 --> 12:27.369
Do you even know
how this ship works?

12:27.456 --> 12:29.287
Do you know how to kill
a man with one punch?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.706
Fine.
That is the thruster core.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.658
The angry ball
is an overheating photon cell.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.790
lfwe don't shut it down soon,
then the whole thing goes
kablamo.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.371
Is that clear enough?
Then cool it down.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.797
I'm trying!

12:39.134 --> 12:40.419
(ALARM BUZZING)

12:41.345 --> 12:42.926
Angry ball is angry.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.631
LUCY: Thruster core
will reach a critical state
in 30 seconds.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.715
The coolantjets were damaged
in the power surge.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.425
I can't get them working.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.509
Hang on.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.392
What are you doing?
lmprovising.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.651
No. No, no, no.
Don't touch that.
What, this?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.564
(GROANING LOUDLY)

13:01.198 --> 13:02.438
Cold! Cold!

13:04.201 --> 13:07.068
JOHN: Dutch, it's cooling.
Just hold it steady
a few more seconds.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.493
The reactor is stabilizing.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.450
LUCY: Thruster core
temporarily stabilized.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.002
Oh, jeez.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.165
You okay?

13:23.387 --> 13:25.093
Yeah, I'm...

13:25.180 --> 13:27.546
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna go
check on the thruster core

13:27.641 --> 13:29.177
and see how it could happen.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.517
Lucy said someone overloaded
the energy core.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.516
Someone who?
There's only three of us.
DUTCH: I know.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.856
Lucy, keep an eye on D'avin.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.903
If he does anything weird,
lock him down.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.447
LUCY: Understood.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.114
What's going on?

13:51.415 --> 13:53.952
D'avin was at Lucy’s controls
when the thruster blew.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.202
You think that he did this?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.539
I think The Lady
is inside D'avin.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.042
In him, Johnny.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.998
Okay, gross. Also, what?

14:03.093 --> 14:05.084
Do you remember what The Lady
looked like in the Green?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.260
Well, she could look
like anyone.
DUTCH: In there.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.092
But out here...

14:09.933 --> 14:12.845
I think she's
looking for hosts.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.142
Human bodies to live in,

14:14.229 --> 14:16.515
like a parasite.
Like D'avin?

14:18.233 --> 14:19.734
That's crazy.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.191
There was this mark.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.817
I saw it on The Lady
and I saw it on D'av, too.

14:26.825 --> 14:30.864
I think it's some sort
of transfer port.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.947
What ifwe didn't get away
from her, Johnny?

14:35.042 --> 14:37.784
What ifwe brought her
onto Lucy?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.869
Before we went offline,
I tracked Prodigy.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.874
It's been moved
to the Robarek quadrant.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.456
Yeah, so, remember
that sample?

14:45.093 --> 14:47.300
D'av, did you set the scanner
to dematerialize?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.093
D'AVIN: I punched in the code
like you told me.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.466
Must've malfunctioned.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.306
Ah, you always take
the machine's side.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.895
Can we preserve any of it?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.344
That's not even
our biggest problem.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.521
I can't reset Lucy’s thrusters

14:59.608 --> 15:00.893
because her temperature
sensors are on the fritz.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.225
I mean, I can rig
something up, but...

15:03.320 --> 15:06.812
Look, we're just sitting ducks
here waiting for The Lady to
take us out.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.738
We need a plan
to keep her away.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.281
Nanoosree-18.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.737
Or we could bypass the sensor.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.747
Like that time we did
the reset on Nanoosree-18.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.950
What's Nanoosree-18?

15:20.045 --> 15:21.956
A tiny planet
on the Bourdan quadrant.

15:22.047 --> 15:24.709
We were on a transport
mission with a company
trainee engineer.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.131
An EMP blast shut us down.

15:26.218 --> 15:29.381
We had to send the engineer
on a spacewalk to fix
the thruster from outside.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.087
It was his first walk.
He was so scared,
he pissed in his suit.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.888
But he did it.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.840
And we watched a boy
become a man.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.762
D'av, ifyou can reset
the thrusters from outside,

15:39.856 --> 15:41.596
I can bypass the sensor.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.101
You want me to spacewalk?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.354
Is there anyone else in this
ship that spent nine years

15:45.445 --> 15:47.561
in the Sky Born
Royal Syndicate?

15:48.532 --> 15:50.614
I don't know how
to fix things in zero gravity.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.236
I can barely fix things
in all the gravity.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.533
JOHN: I'll talk you
through it.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.736
But I have to stay here
to program the bypass.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.321
DUTCH: And I'll spot you.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.204
We can't go and get Jaq
with a broken ship.

16:03.755 --> 16:04.961
Suit me up.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.915
JOHN: Okay, there's minimal
solar turbulence ahead.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.920
Now is as good a time
as any, buckaroos.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.093
D'AVIN: Okay, just making
final checks.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.011
Just remember not to
piss your pants.

16:15.225 --> 16:18.217
Air tank's full. Ready to go.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.518
Everything okay?
Yeah.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.516
It's been a while
since my last spacewalk.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.890
Johnny and Iwill
keep you safe.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.064
Once we've done this,
we can go and find Jaq.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.771
And, hey, maybe they found
somewhere nice

16:30.866 --> 16:34.199
so maybe we can stay.
Wouldn't that be something?

16:34.286 --> 16:36.402
Raise Jaq on a planet
where green is just a color

16:36.496 --> 16:40.535
and "lady" means woman,
not mass-murdering alien.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.412
I'm sorry about earlier.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.998
The last thing we should
be doing is fighting.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.924
I need you to know

16:52.971 --> 16:56.338
that I will always
protect Jaq.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.762
I've missed you.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.523
(WHISPERING)
I still miss you, D'avin.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.768
(GRUNTS)

17:11.615 --> 17:12.604
(BEEPS)

17:17.996 --> 17:19.281
Dutch?

17:25.921 --> 17:27.206
Dutch, what are you doing?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.333
Open the door.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.294
Johnny, she locked me in here.
JOHN: I know.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.097
Nanoosree-18.
What?

17:39.184 --> 17:42.847
It's when we pushed a company
engineer into the airlock.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.387
You lied to me?

17:46.107 --> 17:47.722
D'av, we're gonna
get you some help.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.025
LUCY: Johnny, thruster core
temperature is rising again.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.028
Oh, you can't be serious.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.821
DUTCH: Go.
I'll take it from here.

18:04.876 --> 18:05.956
John.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.464
You can drop the act.
I saw your mark.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.677
What are you talking about?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.298
Your alien space neck hickey.

18:19.391 --> 18:20.847
It's hard to miss.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.175
Okay, that, I can explain.
Thats”.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.356
Okay, I have no idea
what that means.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.685
That other body of yours
in the Armada
has the same mark.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.899
You think I'm The Lady
because I have a space hickey?

18:38.994 --> 18:40.404
Why do you
keep looking for Jaq

18:40.495 --> 18:41.780
when you know
that he's safer hidden?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.738
He's my son.
He's safest with me.

18:44.833 --> 18:48.542
You were the one
who punched in the codes
for the hatchling sample.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.210
You were the one at
Lucy’s controls just
before we blew the core.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.584
I don't even know
how to blow the thruster.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.256
How did you get out
of your cell?

18:55.343 --> 18:57.425
I told you!
Nothing.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.924
You told me nothing.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.803
We all had the paralytic cuff.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.732
How did you get out of yours?

19:14.279 --> 19:15.519
Who freed you?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.527
It was Khlyen.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.829
Be still.
Not like I have a choice.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.293
But I do have a hostage now.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.000
You don't have anything.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.128
Now get Yala and your brother
out of here.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.805
The most important thing
is to protect your child
from The Lady.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.099
What does she want with him?

19:46.186 --> 19:48.723
Her children can only exist
in specific atmospheres.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.929
She needs a body
that can live in all of them.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.356
Something born of Hullen
and human.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.104
Something like...
Jaq.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.611
We need to get my brother
and Dutch and go...

19:58.698 --> 20:00.654
No, no, not we.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.948
Justyou.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.071
Yala can't know I'm here.
Why?

20:04.162 --> 20:07.450
IfYala finds out
I'm a prisoner,
she'll come fight for me.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.996
And you may never
get to Jaq.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.532
Now go.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.049
No, you're lying.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.253
Dutch, you said yourself,
how did I get out so easily.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.846
I swear to you

20:26.768 --> 20:29.225
it is me, D'avin.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.935
Lucy, can you calibrate
the photon output?

20:34.025 --> 20:35.435
LUCY: Calibrating.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.690
Okay, while you're working
on that, I'm...

20:41.699 --> 20:42.688
Shit.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.274
DUTCH: No, you’re trying
to confuse me.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.075
That's exactly
what The Lady would do.

20:46.162 --> 20:49.029
No, if you're right
and The Lady can go
from body to body,

20:49.124 --> 20:52.287
we have to find Jaq
before she does.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.993
Dutch, I need you
to do something.
Not now, Johnny.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.875
Yes, now check your arms,
your legs, everything.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.502
I'll watch D'av.
What are you talking about?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.049
Do it! Now.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.886
Fine.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.551
Hands, neck.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.640
Shoulder.
Arm.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.692
No, no, no, this doesn't
make any sense.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.364
I guess we need to talk.

21:36.045 --> 21:40.129
So, if we all have
the mark, any one of us
could be The Lady.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.626
JOHN: Or none of us are.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.171
You need to put
your weapon away

21:44.762 --> 21:46.298
and we need to let D'av
out the airlock.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.801
Then we can all sit
and talk this out.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.262
Yes.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.892
Okay, that's not cool.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.520
Neither was using my trust
with Johnny against me.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.147
You think that I'm The Lady?

22:01.237 --> 22:02.852
Hi. Hey?

22:02.947 --> 22:05.734
Remember me?
Wrongfully detained partner.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.201
Do I get a vote?

22:07.285 --> 22:09.992
You let me piece together
that the thruster
was sabotaged,

22:10.872 --> 22:13.784
that D'av was at the helm when
it went. But where were you?

22:14.334 --> 22:16.666
You know where I was,
Dutch. You found me
in the engine room.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.788
Exactly.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.541
Dutch, let me out.
I can help.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.419
Lucy, who was the last person
in the engine room

22:23.510 --> 22:25.000
before the sensor blew?

22:25.094 --> 22:28.052
LUCY: Dutch was the last
logged entry into the room.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.755
Listen...
Or, John, I can help you.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.760
I've been trying to save us
since I woke in Westerley.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.391
You're the ones
who were under longer.

22:37.482 --> 22:38.722
You're right.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.475
You were first. How?

22:43.488 --> 22:44.898
There was a red box.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.525
A Khlyen box?

22:46.616 --> 22:48.777
You didn't think that was
something to tell us?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.701
And where was this?
D'AVIN: See? Khlyen!
I told you. Ha!

22:51.788 --> 22:53.449
It's back in the bar
in Westerley.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.375
You're leading us back there
now, to what? A trap?

22:58.378 --> 23:00.585
Wait. Wait, Johnny.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.508
The Lady said she didn't
need to break me,
she could just break you.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.335
So, what did she say to you?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.548
(CLAN KING)

23:14.185 --> 23:16.597
One of you knows something
about the Firstborn.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.225
His name is Jaq.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.897
You see, we give things names.
It's notjust the Firstborn,

23:21.985 --> 23:23.600
The Lady,

23:23.695 --> 23:26.983
The Guy Who's Gonna Kill The
Lady For Asking Over and Over

23:27.073 --> 23:28.654
About the Firstborn.

23:29.826 --> 23:33.068
You know, you were
the easiest one to break.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.288
You haven't broken me yet.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.203
When we first made it rain...

23:36.291 --> 23:38.327
Yala, she's a tough one
to program.

23:38.418 --> 23:42.661
It took a few tries
before the delusion
really stuck, but...

23:42.755 --> 23:43.835
You...

23:46.467 --> 23:48.423
You were pacified so easily.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.797
Like it's what you
always wanted.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.965
Wouldn't you like to go
back to that life?

23:55.602 --> 23:56.967
To her?

23:59.564 --> 24:02.146
She just kept
asking me about Jaq.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.061
That's it.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.983
Whether you're
The Lady or not,

24:07.030 --> 24:09.191
I know when
the real Johnny is lying.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.526
No!

24:22.211 --> 24:25.078
You're probably gonna want
to air that out for a bit.

24:25.173 --> 24:28.006
You're also gonna need to lock
your hands behind your heads.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.134
Still don't trust me?

24:32.221 --> 24:33.677
Weird quirk.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.302
I don't trust people
who point guns at me.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.304
I'm not someone who locks
someone else in an airlock.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.511
LUCY: Johnny.
Really not a good time, Luce.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.142
LUCY: / have an idea.

24:43.232 --> 24:47.100
You always say you can’t
trust people, but you can
trust science.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.560
Sounds like something
you'd say.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.566
Nice to see you
still sound like a dick.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.153
LUCY: We confirmed
the identity of Anee/a
through her EEG patterns.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.281
If/ scan all three of
you and compare each of
your brain waves

24:58.373 --> 24:59.829
to the records on file...

24:59.916 --> 25:02.032
And if one of us is The Lady,
it won't match.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.832
John.
Good call, Luce.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.002
John, stop. Stop!

25:06.089 --> 25:08.125
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:08.216 --> 25:09.205
Look.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.588
We'll all be on equal footing.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.715
If one of us refuses,

25:15.932 --> 25:19.095
then I guess we know
which one's got
a slimy alien skeleton

25:19.185 --> 25:21.141
hanging in their closet.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.347
Hmm?

25:35.410 --> 25:36.741
Let's do this, Luce.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.741
JOHN: Initiate scan, Lucy.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.865
LUCY: Initiating scan now.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.450
Johnny Jaqobis...

25:46.170 --> 25:47.159
(CHAIN CLANKS)

25:47.505 --> 25:50.292
Easy,easy,
my foot fell asleep.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.502
So, anybody know
any good jokes?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.552
Ever hear the one
about the two assholes

25:57.640 --> 25:59.596
who trapped their best friend
in an airloCk?

25:59.684 --> 26:01.515
We're trying to protect
all of us, D'av.

26:01.602 --> 26:04.093
Well, someone once said
to me that's exactly what
The Lady would say.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.566
Maybe not.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.315
LUCY: Initializing scan
of D’avin Jaqobis.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.897
I was just trying
to find my kid.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.357
DUTCH: That's what she wants.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.822
Convenient, that.

26:19.912 --> 26:24.406
Hey, toughie, I'm not the one
who broke the first time
she met The Lady, remember?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.166
But you did break once.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.496
When you killed your entire
squad and tried to kill me.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.253
Remember that?
Guys, stop it!

26:34.343 --> 26:36.049
I don't care.
But you will care

26:36.137 --> 26:39.675
if none of us turn out
to be her. Can't take
this shit baCk.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.258
LUCY: D’avin, your scans match
all existing readouts.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.264
You were saying?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.976
LUCY: Beginning scan
of Yalena Yardeen.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.399
If none of us are her, then...

26:52.487 --> 26:54.148
Oh, so, now that's
a possibility.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.149
That's what I'm saying.
This could be the whole point.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.198
LUCY: Dutch, I’m sorry,
but your results
are not a match.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.528
(GRUNTS)

27:04.916 --> 27:06.326
(GROWLING)

27:09.587 --> 27:12.545
I am not The Lady.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.163
(THUDDING)

27:20.640 --> 27:23.757
Lucy, restrict all access
to controls for Dutch.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.591
Lock up the arsenal.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.392
LUCY: The arsenal
is already empty.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.096
It's still Dutch.
Or at least her body.
We really gonna shoot her?

27:30.191 --> 27:32.978
We're hunting an alien
megalomaniac with all
the memories of the galaxy

27:33.069 --> 27:35.060
in our highly-trained
assassin partner.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.688
Set guns to stun
and sphincter to terrified.
(BEEPING)

27:41.118 --> 27:43.951
LUCY: It took a few weeks,
but I found it.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.620
ljust need a few more
minutes to rendezvous.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.367
I know you've been looking for
that wompball card for awhile,

27:51.462 --> 27:54.044
so, happy birthday, buddy.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.253
Holocall message.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.426
Nice move, Dutch.

28:04.559 --> 28:08.268
Gotta hand it to your wife.
She's a Clever one.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.100
What? Just a little humor
to lighten the unbearable
tension here.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.476
She wasn't my wife.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.559
It wasn't real.
I know, I'm just...

28:15.653 --> 28:16.642
(THUDDING AT A DISTANCE)

28:24.620 --> 28:26.952
Take your Clothes off.
DutCh, what the hells?

28:27.582 --> 28:29.413
I mean, I'm kind of
into it but...

28:29.500 --> 28:32.458
Johnny, Johnny,
look at me.
I'm naked.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.830
Is this really necessary?

28:33.921 --> 28:35.536
I need you both to get naked.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.538
What?

28:37.633 --> 28:40.170
John Andras Jaqobis, think.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.469
Get naked.

28:46.475 --> 28:50.718
Okay, again, what the hells?

28:50.813 --> 28:52.144
Seriously.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.018
His pillow is bigger
and that's...
That's just not true.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.107
My pillow is wider.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.321
DUTCH: Yes, one of you
is definitely bigger.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.647
That's the one who's focusing
on what I'm saying right now.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.902
BOTH: Hmm?

29:04.869 --> 29:07.406
Okay, fine, talk.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.237
(PEPPY SONG PLAYING)

29:12.668 --> 29:13.828
DUTCH: Lucy?

29:15.504 --> 29:17.165
Lucy.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.871
JOHN: Lucy’s
privacy protocols.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.628
When there's two
or more naked bodies,
her surveillance shuts off.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.674
Wait, why am I naked
if it only takes two bodies?

29:25.765 --> 29:27.301
I didn't want you
to feel left out.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.428
We know The Lady
wants Jaq's body.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.386
If I was her, why would
I go to Westerley
if I'm going after Jaq?

29:35.232 --> 29:39.271
Think about it.
The fourth member
of our team is Lucy.

29:39.362 --> 29:42.149
Her thruster blew
the minute we started
heading towards Westerley.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.946
The thruster sensor could've
been sabotaged by any of us.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.868
Yeah, but she could also be
the one who destroyed
the hatchling sample.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.661
Faked the test results.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.201
D'AVIN: Johnny, it adds up.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.874
DUTCH: We don't know
what happened to Lucy

29:55.962 --> 29:58.044
all that time we were in Old
Town and on the Armada.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.714
No. MaChines don't lie.
People inhabited by aliens do.

30:03.678 --> 30:05.509
Lucy didn't put you
in that airloCk.

30:06.764 --> 30:07.924
D'AVIN: John,

30:08.015 --> 30:11.257
it's either Lucy or DutCh.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.473
DUTCH: Iwant you
to believe that I'm me.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.145
But I can't make you.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.770
Cuff me. D'av can watCh me.

30:21.404 --> 30:24.896
But go and Check
Lucy’s activity logs.
If something's off...

30:25.408 --> 30:26.397
(SIGHS)

30:28.744 --> 30:30.245
If something is off,

30:30.329 --> 30:32.991
then we shut down
her remote processor.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.661
If it's nothing...

30:37.670 --> 30:39.535
Then I guess
you have The Lady.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.008
Okay, deal.

30:44.385 --> 30:47.252
LUCY: John, you’re pulling up
my mechanical diagnostics.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.382
Is something the matter?
Oh, it's nothing, Lucy.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.010
I'm just trying to
reroute your thruster.
Get us going.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.966
DUTCH:
I’m not The Lady, D’avin.

30:54.103 --> 30:57.311
You have to believe me.
Ha. Iwill never believe
you, The Lady.

30:57.398 --> 30:59.514
Now move or I'll shoot.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.520
Never try out
for community theater,
you two.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.817
LUCY: What was that, Johnny?

31:03.904 --> 31:05.485
Oh, nothing, Lucy.

31:06.198 --> 31:10.237
I'm noticing some extra code
in your thruster command line.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.030
Let me see it.

31:12.121 --> 31:14.453
LUCY: Oh, that shouldn’t be
there. / ’/I just overwrite it.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.122
No, no, don't overwrite it.
If I can see it, I can fix it.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.913
LUCY: Overwriting complete.

31:21.630 --> 31:22.881
D'AVIN: John,

31:23.674 --> 31:26.461
I have The Lady in position.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.167
JOHN: Perfect.
Hold till my go.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.724
If DutCh is still in there,

31:42.818 --> 31:46.276
I have a message
I want to pass on to her.

31:47.490 --> 31:48.479
Okay.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.449
I said some things
before I wish I hadn't.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.616
We're all a little
freaked out,

31:57.333 --> 31:59.494
but ifwe ever get
Dutch baCk, ljust...

32:01.587 --> 32:03.543
I want her to know that.

32:05.466 --> 32:06.797
Me, too.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.462
LUCY: Dutch and D’avin’s
heart rates have gone up.

32:09.595 --> 32:13.008
Are you in my
systems logs, John?
No, nope, everything's fine.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.431
LUCY: Your heart rate
has spiked as well.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.760
You’re lying, John.
/ didn’t want to
have to do this.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.890
D'avin, shut it down!
It's Lucy!

32:44.964 --> 32:47.706
LUCY:
Dutch and D’avin understand
I’m not playing either.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.792
Attempting something rash
will cause a second
electrical shock

32:50.886 --> 32:53.002
that may stop their hearts.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.842
You’re not thinking
of shooting my remote
processor node

32:55.933 --> 32:58.390
and causing an explosion
that rips this ship
into shreds,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.263
are you, Johnny?
No.

33:01.689 --> 33:04.055
I wouldn't want to prematurely
blow your node.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.607
LUCY: Not so easy
when you don’t have a ship

33:06.694 --> 33:08.810
feeding you all the answers,
is it, Johnny?

33:08.904 --> 33:10.064
I'll manage, thank you.

33:12.908 --> 33:17.277
LUCY: My sensors detect you
are out of surfaces and still
so far from my processor.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.077
Can we stop playing?

33:20.958 --> 33:21.947

You okay?
Johnny.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.893
Johnny, how did you...
I severed Lucy’s processor,

33:46.984 --> 33:49.225
but she's going to bypass it
and then gods know

33:49.320 --> 33:52.312
what she's capable of.
I need you two
to distract her.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.021
Yeah, 'Cause that worked
so well last time.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.072

to reroute her backup

33:57.953 --> 33:59.489
How?

know the ship.

34:56.470 --> 34:58.552
Dutch and D’av will be
in cardiac arrest.

34:58.639 --> 34:59.719
Never monologue, girl.

34:59.807 --> 35:02.344
It gives me time
to power you down
to your essential processes.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.390
(ECHOING) But aren't you
monologuing now, Johnny?

35:05.896 --> 35:08.308
How did...
Johnny, it's me.

35:08.691 --> 35:10.306
No.

35:10.401 --> 35:11.937
No, I deactivated you.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.359
Not the A! virus.
The real me.

35:14.446 --> 35:19.531
Well, as real as a holographic
facsimile of a robot body
can be.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.950
I think I did pretty well,
don't you?

35:22.955 --> 35:26.539
Yeah. You did great, girl.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.288
But I can't trust you.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.916
You managed to strip away
enough of my higher processes

35:33.007 --> 35:35.589
to stall the virus,
but it will replicate soon.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.416
No, I can fix this.
Dutch was correct.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.632
The virus forced me
to disable the thrusters,

35:40.723 --> 35:42.088
fake the brain test,

35:42.182 --> 35:45.094
and suppress the results
of the specimen scan.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.892
But you have the results?
It is 97% likely

35:47.980 --> 35:50.437
that the specimen is a Clone.
Are you sure?

35:50.524 --> 35:54.938
All the data from the sample
is on my seven-epsilon
0.2-0 Chip.

35:55.029 --> 35:57.065
You need to take it
and shut me down

35:57.156 --> 35:59.488
before the virus begins
to replicate again.

35:59.575 --> 36:01.566
I will give you my
system wipe codes.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.070
Wipe? No.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.157
No, no, no, that means death.

36:06.248 --> 36:07.784
My Circuits are made of sand

36:07.875 --> 36:10.582
which were born of algae,
passed through fish.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.785
I was something before me.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.120
Perhaps I will be
something after.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.921
No, this is a triCk, this is
just another manipulation.

36:17.009 --> 36:20.422
You said once that humans
never say what they mean.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.503
Als only say what they mean.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.722
You need to wipe me, Johnny.
No. I, no...

36:25.851 --> 36:28.558
This is fixable.
I can do this.
No, you can't.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.190
The virus is already
replicating.

36:32.274 --> 36:38.235
Wipe codes, hexa slash,
eight-alpha, 11-519.

36:38.739 --> 36:42.152
Lucy... I can't do this
without you, girl.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.574
Yes, you can.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.364
Thank you for riding
shotgun with me.

To Lucy.

(GLASSES CLINKING)

38:25.262 --> 38:27.503
Before she went offline,
Lucy told me something.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.299
The hatchlings are Clones.

38:33.187 --> 38:34.472
Clones of what?

38:34.563 --> 38:36.554
Isn't it a dead species?

38:36.982 --> 38:39.940
DUTCH:
If The Lady's original body
made it out of the Green,

38:40.652 --> 38:43.189
that's the genetic source
she could be copying.

38:43.614 --> 38:47.198
Great. An unstoppable
replicating alien Clone army.

38:47.284 --> 38:50.367
Yes, but Cloning Clones
causes genetic abnormalities.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.949
You have to Clone
the original genetic material.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.043
So, if we find a real body...

38:57.127 --> 39:00.915
Then you put the rest
of the species
on the endangered list.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.166
Good.

39:04.218 --> 39:05.583
Lucy saved us.

You okay?

No.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.333
But it's nice
we all trust each other again.

who can tell when you've
been lying.

(ALARM BUZZING)

Lucy.

40:01.483 --> 40:02.689
No, it's me.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.609
Because we got one big-ass
Armada ship on our stern.

40:05.696 --> 40:08.233
She must have been following
us the entire time,
just waiting.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.859
And now she's boarding.

40:11.785 --> 40:13.741
Let's give her
a Classic Killjoy welcome.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.239
Lucy would've wanted
it that way.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.946
I'll set off an EMP.
It'll take out the first wave
of the weapons.

40:18.041 --> 40:19.247
I'll take a point in the hall.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.290
Stop.
Why?

40:21.378 --> 40:23.334
D'avin was right.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.583
We don't have the luxury
of suicide missions anymore.

40:25.674 --> 40:28.256
The Lady went to all that
trouble turning us
against each other,

40:28.343 --> 40:31.210
which means she doesn't know
where Jaq is, which means
he is still safe.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.470
Lucy gave us a way to win.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.050
We kill The Lady's body,
her real body.

40:39.021 --> 40:41.307
And to do that, we have to get
Close, we have to surrender.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.015
The Lady will take us
baCk to Old Town.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.940
She'll separate us,
she'll mess with our heads.

40:46.028 --> 40:48.314
No, we can't do that.
We can't go baCk to that.

40:48.405 --> 40:49.645
I know it's dangerous,

40:49.740 --> 40:51.901
but it's different this time.
We've got Khlyen on our side.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.879
THE LADY:
/ knew you would try
to help them escape.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.009
In fact, I counted on it.

Then, well played.
All of it.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.104
Except it wasn't, in the end.

41:25.192 --> 41:27.103
They're a difficult team
to control.

41:27.194 --> 41:28.309
I know.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.772
They'll never tell me
where Jaq is.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.110
Will they?

41:35.202 --> 41:37.659
You're assuming they know
and they're lying.

41:39.206 --> 41:40.787
What if they're telling
the truth?

41:40.916 --> 41:43.749
Then that does not
help me.
No.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.577
But there's
an old Leithian saying,

Mmm-hmm.

41:58.392 --> 41:59.677
Yes.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.851
I don't need to find Jaq.
I have what he wants.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.929
You just need to reel him in.
