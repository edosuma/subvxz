WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:07.877
<i>My son, 15 years ago,
I lost him to drugs.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:09.487
<i>I just don't know where he is.</i>

00:09.531 --> 00:12.229
<i>- You have a call from...
- Sean Archer.</i>

00:12.273 --> 00:14.101
<i>An inmate
at Cook County Jail.</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.711
<i>Dad?</i>

00:15.754 --> 00:18.061
<i>You have a relationship
with our perfect daughter.</i>

00:18.105 --> 00:19.932
I'm married,
and I love my husband.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.804
And I can't be a part of that.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.068
You all right?

00:25.112 --> 00:27.679
All my clothes,
everything, it's gone.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.768
<i>Jessa Rinaldi,
I'm placing you under arrest.</i>

00:29.812 --> 00:31.248
You're charged
with aggravated arson

00:31.292 --> 00:32.771
and one count
of attempted murder

00:32.815 --> 00:35.383
against Dr. Will Halstead.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.344
Hey, are people still
coming in and out of here?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.042
Yeah, my contractor
came by last week

00:42.085 --> 00:43.782
to work up an estimate.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.871
You know, he thinks
we can salvage a lot of this.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.004
Now I'm just waiting on the
friggin' insurance company

00:48.048 --> 00:49.266
to approve my claim.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.269
Well, you're in violation
of building code

00:52.313 --> 00:57.622
sections 13-117-12 and 125.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.103
And until such a time
they're remedied,

01:00.147 --> 01:04.716
a fine of $700
will be assessed daily.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.370
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.111
Can you give me a break here?

01:08.155 --> 01:09.721
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.767
Hey, if it were up to me,
I'd call in a wrecking ball

01:11.810 --> 01:13.073
and get it over with.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.358
You got old.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.927
Yeah,
it's been a while, so...

01:41.971 --> 01:43.799
15 years.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.282
I wasn't sure
you were coming in.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.892
Well,
I would have come earlier,

01:49.935 --> 01:53.025
but it turns out that

01:53.069 --> 01:56.116
it takes a while to get...

01:56.159 --> 01:58.814
granted visitation.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.643
So I was talking
to your lawyer.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.471
A Lisa Bly?

02:05.777 --> 02:08.998
From
the public defender's office?

02:09.041 --> 02:10.260
- Mm-hmm.
- She said something

02:10.304 --> 02:12.436
about a plea deal.
- Yeah, we talked it over.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.569
She didn't think it was
a good idea to fight this.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.963
Doesn't sound like she fills
you with confidence, does she?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.443
I'm gonna get you a new lawyer,

02:19.487 --> 02:21.402
somebody who knows
what the hell they're doing.

02:21.445 --> 02:24.622
It's OK.
I'm cool with it.

02:24.666 --> 02:29.627
You're cool with it,
just staying in prison?

02:29.671 --> 02:31.455
That can't possibly
be what you want.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.761
Can we change the subject, please?

02:32.804 --> 02:34.415
Oh, for Christ's sake!

02:34.458 --> 02:36.547
Sean, you've been like this
since you were a kid.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.288
You're always giving up
on things too easily.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.681
Kind of like
how you gave up on me.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.382
Are you still using?

02:45.426 --> 02:47.515
- Hmm?

02:47.558 --> 02:50.387
You know what?
This was not a good idea.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.041
Hey, I'm just trying--

02:52.084 --> 02:53.347
I'm hanging up now, Dad.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.565
We should do this again sometime,

02:54.609 --> 02:56.176
maybe in another 15 years.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.264
Wait a second.
I'm just trying to--

03:03.966 --> 03:05.315
<i>$700 a day.</i>

03:05.359 --> 03:06.795
Can you believe that?

03:06.838 --> 03:08.884
It's like I just got hit
by a truck and they want me

03:08.927 --> 03:10.668
to donate the little bit
of blood I have left.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.323
Maybe you should just
tear it down like the guy said.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.759
Are you kidding me?

03:14.803 --> 03:16.979
Hannah, I got
way too much invested.

03:17.022 --> 03:20.025
No, screw them.
I'm gonna file an appeal.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.593
It's been, what, like,
a month since the fire?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.247
- Yeah, and?
- I'm feeling like you're

03:24.291 --> 03:26.858
embracing this modern-day Job
thing a bit too vigorously.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.252
Hey, we could use
the two of you.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.084
So do you think I'm acting
like some kind of martyr?

03:35.127 --> 03:37.478
I'm just saying that
the sooner you let this go,

03:37.521 --> 03:39.219
the sooner you can move on
with your life.

03:39.262 --> 03:42.874
Nine-year-old male, 25 mile
per hour motor vehicle crash.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.267
Mom and son
both restrained and stable.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.442
No loss of consciousness.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.052
Kid complaining
of pain in right arm.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.532
Mom has no vocal complaints.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.838
She's coming in
right behind us.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.709
I got Mom.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.885
It looks like they might
be living out of their car,

03:53.929 --> 03:54.756
for what it's worth.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.540
Good to know. Thanks.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.977
Hey there.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.370
Actually, I'm Will.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.199
What's your name?
- Henry.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.462
Can I ask
what you got in that jar?

04:05.506 --> 04:07.769
It's a chrysalis.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.511
One day, it's gonna turn
into a butterfly.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.513
That is super cool.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.732
Would it be all right if
Nurse Doris here holds on to it

04:14.776 --> 04:18.388
while I look at your arm?
- Thanks.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.347
- Let's get X-ray in here.
- Yeah.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.305
Now let's look at this arm.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.177
Does it hurt?
-  Yes.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.918
I know.
I'm sorry, buddy.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.356
OK, that's it.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.967
Anything else hurt?

04:32.010 --> 04:34.361
- No.
- Good.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.015
Now, do you remember
what happened?

04:37.059 --> 04:39.453
We were looking
for a new parking spot,

04:39.496 --> 04:42.934
and I don't know,

04:42.978 --> 04:47.112
Mom just kind of drove
off the side of the road.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.202
OK. We're gonna get a quick
picture of your arm, all right?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.466
Hey, you're being really brave.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.644
All right, X-ray up.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.821
Well, now that
doesn't look too bad.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.258
All right, Henry, I'm gonna go
talk to your mom for a minute.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.303
I'll be right back.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.566
Here you go.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.264
How are we looking?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309
X-ray is clear.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.353
Beyond a scrape or two,

05:10.397 --> 05:12.355
I'd say she's doing all right.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.574
Ms. Mitchell,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.315
I just saw your son.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.229
He's fine,
except for some arm pain.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.363
The X-ray showed a nondisplaced
distal radius fracture,

05:20.407 --> 05:22.278
just a fancy way
of saying he broke his arm.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.540
What?

05:23.584 --> 05:24.933
It'll heal quickly
with a simple cast.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.804
I just need your consent
to treat him.

05:26.848 --> 05:27.805
No.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.285
Excuse me?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.069
What have you done
with my boy?

05:31.113 --> 05:32.201
Henry's right next door.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.812
Who are you?
What am I doing here?

05:34.856 --> 05:37.641
- Jenny, you had a car crash.
- I don't believe you.

05:37.685 --> 05:38.947
You've been brought
to Chicago Med.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.689
I'm Dr. Asher.
This is Dr. Halstead.

05:41.732 --> 05:45.170
You're with the collection
agency, aren't you?

05:45.214 --> 05:47.434
I told you already.
You can't have our souls.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.522
- OK, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- OK, all right.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.871
Give five of Haldol.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.351
Jenny--
- Let me out of here!

05:51.394 --> 05:52.700
- It's OK, Jenny.
- Right now!

05:52.743 --> 05:55.180
Calm down.
Let us help you.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.400
Nobody touches my son!

05:57.444 --> 05:59.184
No.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.590
Hey, can I get
everyone's attention, please?

06:13.634 --> 06:15.549
Thank you.

06:15.592 --> 06:19.988
I'm sure that you have
all noticed lately

06:20.031 --> 06:22.599
that we are running low

06:22.643 --> 06:25.994
on a number of key supplies--

06:26.037 --> 06:29.563
dialysis tubing,
contrast dye, syringes.

06:29.606 --> 06:32.827
And I am just as frustrated
as all of you are

06:32.870 --> 06:35.003
at the seemingly intractable

06:35.046 --> 06:38.180
and unpredictable
supply chain disruptions,

06:38.223 --> 06:42.880
but we are working
to find solutions.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.187
Meanwhile,
I'd like to remind you

06:45.230 --> 06:48.190
that we are all
in this together.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.323
Be mindful of that,
all right?

06:51.367 --> 06:53.064
Let's all get back to work.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.243
Are you two looking
for a consult?

06:58.287 --> 07:00.202
Yeah, I got a nine-year-old
in three with a broken arm

07:00.245 --> 07:02.509
whose mom won't give us consent
to treat him.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.120
Her behavior suggests some
kind of psychiatric disorder.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.339
- We were forced to sedate her.
- What did you give her?

07:07.383 --> 07:08.993
She still seems
pretty animated.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.560
Five of Haldol.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.258
Maybe she's a little resistant
to it.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.912
Yeah, at least now
you can go speak with her

07:14.956 --> 07:16.653
and convince her
to let us help her son.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.089
You know, I'd rather wait
for the labs

07:18.133 --> 07:19.526
and see
what the tox screen says.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.136
What about the boy?

07:21.179 --> 07:22.572
I'll go talk to him.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.619
Any other family around?
Father, grandfather?

07:25.662 --> 07:27.272
No, none that we could find.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.231
OK, I'll report back.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.193
Ah, there's
a vaguely familiar face.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.500
You're finally back
from vacation, I see.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.329
You know, for a second there,
I thought we lost you for good.

07:40.372 --> 07:43.724
Hey, I came in early
to get a coffee with you.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.421
You weren't in.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.902
Yeah, I had
to get my oil changed,

07:47.945 --> 07:49.425
but you look well-rested.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.166
No cell service,
no Wi-Fi.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.124
Just surf, sand,
and the stars for two weeks.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.561
- Yeah.
- I am, as they say,

07:54.604 --> 07:56.214
totally chill.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.738
Excuse me, Dr. Archer.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.653
I was wondering if I could
go over this patient with you.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.569
First year resident,
Dr. Zach Hudgins.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.919
Allow me to introduce you
to one of your attendings,

08:04.962 --> 08:06.529
Dr. Ethan Choi.

08:06.573 --> 08:10.359
I'm sure Dr. Choi would be,
like, totally happy to assist.

08:10.402 --> 08:11.578
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

08:11.621 --> 08:12.970
Hi, Zach.
What do we got here?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.581
51-year-old male,
progressive cough,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.104
congestion in his chest.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.235
His sats are kind of crappy.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.585
Crappy, you say?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.674
- Low 90s, high 80s.
- Did you get a chest X-ray?

08:20.717 --> 08:22.153
That's happening now,
but here's the thing.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.591
The patient has
advanced stage ALS.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.028
Kind of a detail you might
want to lead with, Zach.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.551
What's the patient's name?
- Albert.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.292
Albert Marrero.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.208
Ooh, let me see that.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.949
Albert Marrero.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.821
Take a deep breath.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.870
<i>
All I have.</i>

08:42.913 --> 08:45.002
Well, I think
you're holding out on me, Al.

08:45.046 --> 08:48.049
So I understand
you two go back a ways.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.486
<i>Dean... first to diagnose.</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:53.402
It's a little
over six years ago now.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.144
I won that bet,
by the way, Al.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.277
<i>Check's in the mail.</i>

08:59.321 --> 09:01.628
Well, I don't think
you have a pneumonia yet.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.151
Your X-ray is OK,

09:03.194 --> 09:05.936
but these things can lag
by a day or two.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.372
<i>Oh, goody.</i>

09:07.416 --> 09:09.505
But your lungs do
sound a little junky.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.900
You're just not clearing
your secretions adequately.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.510
ALS can weaken
your diaphragm,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.818
and thus, your cough
just isn't strong enough.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.341
We call it plugging,

09:19.384 --> 09:21.648
but it could be
a little difficult to clear.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.650
Right, which is why
I think it would be prudent

09:23.693 --> 09:27.567
to just run a bronchoscope
down there and clear it all up.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.004
No muss, no fuss.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.875
<i>Would you need
to put me under?</i>

09:31.919 --> 09:36.010
Light sedation, so as
to make it easier to intubate.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.533
<i>No.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:39.491
Al, it would
only be temporary.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.319
It's not as invasive
as it sounds.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.017
<i>I have a DNI.</i>

09:43.060 --> 09:44.409
<i>I don't have control</i>

09:44.453 --> 09:47.021
<i>over what this disease
is doing to my body.</i>

09:47.064 --> 09:51.460
<i>I, at least, want to keep
control over how I die.</i>

09:51.503 --> 09:54.332
Al, look, we're getting way
too ahead of ourselves here.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.508
We're just talking
about clearing some mucus.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.861
Dean, can I talk to you?

10:00.904 --> 10:02.036
Sure.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.691
Excuse us.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.736
Hey, Dean, I think
we can clear the plugging

10:06.780 --> 10:09.391
without bronching him.
- Eh, doubtful.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.611
Put the percussion
vest on him, chest BT,

10:11.654 --> 10:14.309
breathing treatments,
just like a CF patient.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.093
Come on.
It's worth a shot.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.399
Yeah.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.667
Huh, only a two?

10:24.711 --> 10:27.583
It's OK if it hurts
more than that, you know?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.889
Matter of fact,
what I'm hearing is

10:28.932 --> 10:30.673
that the higher the number,

10:30.717 --> 10:34.024
the more likely the nurses are
to bring you some ice cream

10:34.068 --> 10:35.069
from the cafeteria.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.766
I'm just saying.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.116
My arm really
doesn't hurt that bad.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.335
OK.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.948
Are you here
to take me away from my mom?

10:44.992 --> 10:47.690
No, Henry, I'm not.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.650
Why are you--
why are you asking me that?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.391
A lot of people have
been talking about that.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.265
What I really want
to talk to you about

10:57.308 --> 10:59.093
is this beautiful chrysalis
you have.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.225
How long have you had it for?

11:01.269 --> 11:04.141
Maybe a month or so.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.709
Your mom get that for you?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.145
Mm-mm-mm.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.499
Has she been going through
a bit of a tough time recently?

11:16.501 --> 11:19.287
See those markings
at the bottom of the wings?

11:19.330 --> 11:21.245
And that means it's a girl.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.943
No kidding?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.466
You know,
I didn't know that.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.295
She might not
look so good now,

11:27.338 --> 11:29.950
but pretty soon,
she's gonna break out

11:29.993 --> 11:31.821
and be beautiful again.

11:31.865 --> 11:32.822
I know it.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.569
I tell you what, that's
one gutsy little kid in there.

11:40.612 --> 11:44.312
Look, far as I can tell, his
mom started to act out around,

11:44.355 --> 11:45.313
I don't know,
1st of the year.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.836
Psychotic break?

11:46.880 --> 11:47.794
I don't think so.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.752
I mean, bipolar, schizophrenia,

11:49.796 --> 11:51.841
they just rarely present
this late in life.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.713
- Mm.
- Tox screens come back yet?

11:53.756 --> 11:55.715
Clear.
Nothing in the blood or urine.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.804
OK, well,
I want to take a look

11:57.847 --> 12:00.458
and then maybe try and have
a conversation with the mom.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.157
- Mm-hmm.
- So what about Henry?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.636
His arm is stable, right?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.248
I mean, not getting any worse.
We got a bit of time.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.510
How long is a bit?

12:08.553 --> 12:09.772
I mean, this kid
needs our attention

12:09.816 --> 12:11.078
in more ways than one.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.470
Mom clearly can't help him.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.645
They're living out
of their car.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.517
I think we should
double doc his consent

12:15.560 --> 12:16.779
or get a court order.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.172
In order to do that,
though, Will,

12:18.215 --> 12:19.347
I've got to declare her

12:19.390 --> 12:20.827
incapable of caring
for her child,

12:20.870 --> 12:23.351
which means put her
on a psych hold,

12:23.394 --> 12:26.267
which means
getting DCFS involved.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.182
Look, I'm worried
about the kid too.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.662
I just really want to make sure
we're right before we go there.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.840
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

12:33.883 --> 12:34.928
OK.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.451
- Maggie? Maggie?
- Yeah.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.495
Grant,
what are you doing here?

12:37.539 --> 12:38.714
Is everything OK?
- Look.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.369
Keith here had an accident
on the worksite.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.979
They asked us to wait
for an intake nurse,

12:43.023 --> 12:45.808
but I was hoping maybe I had
enough pull to cut the line.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.376
I don't know.
We kind of have a system here.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.899
Hey, Grant.
What's up?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.640
We've got a bit
of a situation here, V.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
OK, yeah,
let's take a look.

12:53.642 --> 12:54.948
Room five is OK, isn't it?

12:54.991 --> 12:56.471
- Sure.
- OK, come on.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.520
We were doing some site prep
for a new sports therapy clinic

13:02.564 --> 13:04.479
I designed
down in Hyde Park.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.873
Anyway, the team was clearing
some dead trees, and--

13:06.916 --> 13:08.875
OK.
OK, how about I take a look?

13:08.918 --> 13:11.181
Let's see.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.704
Don't touch it, OK?

13:12.748 --> 13:14.184
Let's just have you chill here
for a second

13:14.228 --> 13:15.403
while we come up
with a game plan.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.144
Thanks, Vanessa, Maggie.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.015
We're gonna need a CT
of this.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.712
Put the order in.
I'll call CAT scan.

13:20.756 --> 13:21.801
OK.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.500
- Dr. Choi!

13:25.543 --> 13:26.849
- What's going on?
- He's really struggling.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.025
O2 sats 82 and falling.
- Nasal cannula.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.897
You can't clear the mucus.
Don't worry, Al.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.508
We'll get you through this.
- Help me sit him forward.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.902
Now bang on his back.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.468
No, use your fist!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.819
Pound with your first hard!
- Sats at 70s.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.429
- I don't want to hurt him.
- For Christ's sakes.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.387
Get out of here.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.260
There it is.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.873
I'm not losing this one,
not today.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.318
I know it might not
seem like it at the moment,

14:01.362 --> 14:03.016
but you, Keith,
are a lucky guy.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.845
Somehow this stick managed
to lodge itself cleanly

14:05.888 --> 14:07.020
along the side of your orbit

14:07.063 --> 14:08.543
without penetrating
your eyeball.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.198
So we can just go ahead
and take it right out.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.374
- Right now?
- It'll be fine.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.332
Are you sure
you're qualified to do this?

14:15.376 --> 14:17.552
Well, she finished
top of her class, Keith.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.336
I can give you something
to calm your nerves,

14:19.380 --> 14:20.337
if you'd like.

14:20.381 --> 14:23.210
No, no,
just get it over with.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.385
OK.

14:26.561 --> 14:27.475
Hold still.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.527
There.
All done.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.573
Thank you.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.053
How does it feel?

14:40.096 --> 14:41.619
It still hurts a ton,

14:41.663 --> 14:43.578
but yeah,
better than a second ago.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.493
Yeah, we'll give you
something for the pain.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.712
In the meantime, if you
could just follow my finger.

14:47.756 --> 14:48.888
Yeah.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.980
Did you just see that,
how steady her hand is

14:54.023 --> 14:55.938
and how confident? -
I know.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.593
It's like we created
some kind of Jedi Knight.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.769
I'm honestly just blown away.

15:00.812 --> 15:01.988
She's your spitting image, Maggie.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.772
It's crazy how that works.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.862
Any word yet
from ophthalmology?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.037
They're swamped.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.256
They say
they'll be down this afternoon.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.431
I really don't want
to discharge Keith

15:10.474 --> 15:11.911
until they see him.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.042
If you've got
to get back to work,

15:13.086 --> 15:14.043
I can call you
when we're done here.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.479
Oh, no,
Keith's worked for me

15:15.523 --> 15:16.916
for, like, 15 years.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.874
I'm staying
until he's cleared to go.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.789
But maybe we can all
have lunch together.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.617
Yeah, that's a great idea.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.053
I don't know.
I don't think I can get away.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.402
Oh, come on, Maggie.
It'll be fun.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.448
I'm sorry. Crockett,
Kai, we have incoming.

15:27.491 --> 15:30.973
Please, Maggie.
Could you just for me?

15:31.017 --> 15:34.281
OK, but not for another hour.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.545
Let's go!

15:37.588 --> 15:39.416
We're going to Baghdad.
What do we got?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.418
Julián Sanchez, GSW.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.464
Two holes, left thigh,
maybe through and through.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.813
Moderate blood loss
in the field.

15:44.856 --> 15:45.857
Put a pressure dressing
on it,

15:45.901 --> 15:47.033
but not actively bleeding now.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.512
Dropped his pressure
in the ambo.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.600
Gave him a liter of fluid.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.081
BP now 100
with a heart rate of 125.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.778
OK, Julián,
I'm Dr. Marcel.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.084
We're gonna take
good care of you, OK?

15:55.128 --> 15:57.782
Hang in there, bud.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.088
OK, everyone.
Nice and easy.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.437
On my--
- On my count.

16:00.481 --> 16:03.527
One, two, three.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.789
Easy, easy.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.356
Let's get him up on monitors.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.967
OK, DP and PT pulse
has diminished.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.970
Let's strip and flip him, make
sure there's no other holes.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.928
OK, here we go.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.234
One, two, three.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.018
Easy, easy.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.759
Just two in the thigh.
No active bleeding.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.501
OK, let's have X-ray get us
a quick chest and pelvis, OK?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.372
Why do we need a chest X-ray?
He was only shot in the leg.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.113
One whole bullet in,
one whole bullet out.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.376
Make sure they connect.
He was shot twice.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.423
Bullets travel
in unexpected ways, right?

16:29.466 --> 16:32.034
How would you feel if you
left a bullet in his chest?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.471
- X-ray is ready.
- OK, you know what?

16:34.515 --> 16:36.473
Why don't you go tell Maggie
that we're gonna need an angio

16:36.517 --> 16:38.475
to find where the injury
to the artery is.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.389
I'll finish up here.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.355
Jenny?

16:49.704 --> 16:50.705
How are you doing?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.750
I'm Dr. Charles.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.536
They sent you in here
to get my consent, didn't they?

16:55.579 --> 16:56.711
Who's "they"?

16:56.754 --> 16:59.931
The other ones
pretending to be doctors.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.498
That redheaded one tried
to convince me

17:01.542 --> 17:03.239
my son had a broken arm.

17:03.283 --> 17:06.503
You know, Dr. Halstead is,
in fact, a doctor.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.375
And you know, Jenny,
he wasn't lying.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.768
I mean,
I can show you the X-ray.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.336
You think
I can't tell a fake?

17:13.380 --> 17:16.470
I want to see your supervisor,
or I swear, I--

17:20.213 --> 17:21.866
Jenny?

17:21.910 --> 17:24.043
You all right?
What's going on?

17:28.699 --> 17:30.440
Who are you again?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.094
I'm Dr. Charles,

17:32.138 --> 17:35.010
and we were just talking
about Henry, about your son.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.142
I already told you.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.534
I'm not giving
anyone permission

17:37.578 --> 17:39.188
to treat my son.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.581
Well, you know what?

17:42.713 --> 17:45.107
I'd like to get your permission
to treat you,

17:45.151 --> 17:46.891
if that's OK.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.329
Me?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.287
There's nothing wrong with me.

17:51.331 --> 17:54.203
But unfortunately,
we can't release you or Henry

17:54.247 --> 17:56.858
before we rule out any trauma
from the car crash.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.512
So if it's OK,

17:58.555 --> 18:00.644
I'd just like to send you
upstairs for a quick scan.

18:00.688 --> 18:03.386
And as soon as that's done,
I'm free to go?

18:03.430 --> 18:05.084
I tell you what,
how about we do the scan

18:05.127 --> 18:07.738
and see what it tells us
and then go from there?

18:07.782 --> 18:09.566
Does that sound like a plan?

18:14.615 --> 18:15.964
OK.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.404
Did you get her consent?

18:21.448 --> 18:22.971
Not exactly.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.452
I want to send her upstairs
for a head CT with contrast.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.497
And also, can you tell Sam
I want his eyes on this too?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.239
- Roger.
- So what's going on?

18:30.283 --> 18:31.371
You know,
it just doesn't seem like

18:31.414 --> 18:33.068
a garden-variety psychosis,
you know?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.417
There's this odd rhythm to it.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.159
And she had this temporary loss
of mentation.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.160
And I really think
we could be looking

18:38.204 --> 18:39.553
at something neurosurgical.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.859
Let me guess.
Henry's broken arm has to wait?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.165
Well, just bear
with me, buddy.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.166
Let's take a look at this scan,
and I think

18:44.210 --> 18:45.515
we're gonna get some clarity.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.564
We can continue riding out
the percussion vest and nebs.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.957
With a little more time,
there's a chance it could work.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.307
But not a good enough chance.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
The only way to clear
the plugging for sure

18:55.960 --> 18:58.659
and restore your breathing
is with a bronchoscope.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.272
<i>
- No intubation.</i>

19:03.316 --> 19:06.275
I think we've
established by now, Al,

19:06.319 --> 19:07.798
that I'm no alarmist,

19:07.842 --> 19:10.975
so believe me when I say this.

19:11.019 --> 19:14.153
This thing will kill you today,

19:14.196 --> 19:16.590
right here in this room.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.595
<i>If it does, I'm OK.</i>

19:21.638 --> 19:22.770
<i>I'm ready.</i>

19:22.813 --> 19:23.988
Really?

19:24.032 --> 19:25.773
Just like that? Really?

19:25.816 --> 19:27.296
You can honestly tell me

19:27.340 --> 19:30.473
that you've got nothing left
to live for?

19:30.517 --> 19:34.564
Your son,
how's he doing?

19:37.437 --> 19:40.744
<i>Wife's pregnant again.</i>

19:40.788 --> 19:42.093
<i>My second grandchild.</i>

19:42.137 --> 19:43.443
See?

19:43.486 --> 19:46.054
That's something
to look forward to, isn't it?

19:49.449 --> 19:52.321
<i>It's my biggest fear, Dean,</i>

19:52.365 --> 19:55.803
<i>being stuck helpless
on a vent.</i>

20:00.808 --> 20:03.289
I promise you, Al.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.073
I will not let that happen.

20:14.865 --> 20:15.997
Hey, what's going on here?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.303
Why isn't my patient prepped
for angio?

20:17.346 --> 20:18.608
You're not
gonna believe this.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.350
Apparently, they can't
find any contrast dye.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.353
Are you kidding me?

20:24.397 --> 20:25.746
We need to look
at the femoral artery.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.400
His AVIs are at 0.7.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.403
Hey, man, it's not my fault.
Talk to this guy.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.015
All right,
keep an eye on his vitals.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.712
I'll see if radiology has any.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.672
<i>You lucked out.</i>

20:38.715 --> 20:41.805
This is literally the last drop
of contrast we got.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.067
You're kidding.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.287
Blame COVID
or the war in Ukraine.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.767
I don't know.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.638
She had no response
to the Haldol?

20:48.682 --> 20:52.033
Nada, and these weird lapses
in awareness.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.382
Hmm.

20:53.426 --> 20:55.428
And as you know,
resistance to antipsychotics

20:55.471 --> 20:56.907
can sometimes mean...

20:56.951 --> 20:58.561
Something's going on
with her neurotransmitters.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.432
Yeah.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.911
- Hey, Gene?
- Yeah?

21:00.955 --> 21:03.044
I was told you might have
some contrast dye left.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.393
Not after the scan, I don't.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.569
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop.

21:06.613 --> 21:07.701
I need that dye.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.278
I honestly don't even know
why we're having

21:19.321 --> 21:20.366
this conversation.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.584
This is triage 101,
head over leg.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.977
With all due respect, Sam,

21:23.020 --> 21:24.631
perhaps it's not so cut and dry
in this case.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.328
What happens,
Dr. Marcel,

21:26.372 --> 21:29.200
if you're not able
to perform your angiogram?

21:29.244 --> 21:31.507
Well, I'll probably have to
filet the poor guy's thigh open

21:31.551 --> 21:33.335
in order to find
and fix the damage.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.728
It'll be a much bigger surgery

21:34.771 --> 21:36.686
with more blood loss
and a greater risk.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.471
Dr. Charles?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.647
You know, truthfully,
I'm not completely comfortable

21:40.690 --> 21:41.865
making the case
that our patient

21:41.909 --> 21:43.127
is of any greater need
than Dr. Marcel's.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.086
Well, I am.
Look, Sharon.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.740
If I'm being asked
to follow the breadcrumbs

21:46.783 --> 21:48.742
of Ms. Mitchell's symptomology,

21:48.785 --> 21:50.961
I'm suspecting
she might have an astrocytoma

21:51.005 --> 21:53.007
or maybe a leaking aneurysm.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.965
Now, there's no way of knowing
for certain, however,

21:55.009 --> 21:56.837
without a CT with contrast.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.187
But I can assure you,
if those are the possibilities,

21:59.230 --> 22:01.450
without intervention,
her outcome is gonna be

22:01.494 --> 22:03.191
a whole lot worse
than a limp for a few months.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.367
I'm sorry,
but that sounds so nebulous.

22:05.411 --> 22:06.760
I mean, we know precisely

22:06.803 --> 22:08.544
what we have to lose or gain
with our patient.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.068
You're just
on a fishing expedition.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.332
- Who's this guy?
- Kai Tanaka-Reed.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.508
First year surgical resident.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.858
You're a intern, Kai.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.513
Learn not to speak
unless spoken to.

22:20.556 --> 22:24.560
OK, can't we just dilute the
dye enough for two procedures?

22:24.604 --> 22:26.475
We could,
but we risk the chance

22:26.519 --> 22:29.696
of neither scan being adequate.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.699
Look,
there's no ideal option here,

22:32.742 --> 22:35.179
but for now,
head over leg.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.399
The hospital is going
to prioritize

22:37.443 --> 22:38.879
the CT scan
for Ms. Mitchell.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.446
Once again, Sharon,
you've proven yourself

22:40.489 --> 22:41.751
wise beyond your years.

22:41.795 --> 22:44.188
I'll see you up in radiology.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.277
- Well, this sucks.
- It is what it is.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.715
Have Maggie prep an OR.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.849
- Where are we?
- Just getting the RSI drugs.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.286
All right.
Let's tube him.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.203
Yes, sirree.
Let's--let's do that.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.693
You all right?
Your hands look a bit shaky.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.827
Just feel like
I'm auditioning here.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.965
That's not the trachea.

23:23.619 --> 23:24.925
Neither is that.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.100
What's taking so long?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.275
Zach is having
a little difficulty.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.972
It's just not lining up
for some reason.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.670
What's the matter? You've
never done one of these before?

23:30.713 --> 23:32.367
No, I haven't.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.890
Are you kidding?

23:33.934 --> 23:35.718
My med school all but
shut down during the pandemic.

23:35.762 --> 23:36.980
Said it was too big a liability

23:37.024 --> 23:38.417
to have us interact
with patients,

23:38.460 --> 23:39.461
so we did everything online.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.636
But I'm a fast learner.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.855
Yeah, I don't have time
for handholding.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.160
I'll do it myself.
Get out of the way.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.471
No, I'm gonna need
to use a GlideScope.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.777
Keep bagging him
until I get back.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.954
Bag him!
Bag, go!

23:53.997 --> 23:55.956
These kids, I swear.
- Yeah.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.740
Hey, before you get started,

23:57.784 --> 24:00.308
I wanted to tell you about a
book I picked up on the beach.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.657
It's about a death doula.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.530
Nancy, where'd
that GlideScope blade go?

24:04.573 --> 24:06.575
It's over there
in the cabinet.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.316
It's all about
helping people transition

24:08.359 --> 24:10.187
from one plane of existence
to the next.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.493
Uh-huh.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.364
I'm wondering
if we're doing that with Al.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.888
What?

24:14.931 --> 24:17.151
Honoring his journey.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.066
You want to translate that
into English for me?

24:19.109 --> 24:22.156
I don't think we should
be doing this bronchoscopy.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.331
Wait, you don't think
we should be doing

24:23.374 --> 24:24.811
everything we can
to keep him alive?

24:24.854 --> 24:27.117
Not if he doesn't want us to.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.206
So what,
you catch a few juicy waves,

24:29.250 --> 24:31.513
and all of a sudden, you're
preaching palliative care now?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.820
Maybe.
When it's appropriate.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.865
This is an ED, Ethan.
We save lives here.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.520
We don't end them,
at least not on purpose.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.914
Maybe you should have
stayed on that beach.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.406
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.584
Don't change a thing,
'cause you look fine as you is.

24:58.627 --> 25:01.238
- Ben, what are you doing here?
- You remember?

25:01.282 --> 25:03.632
My biannual
to check my blood markers.

25:03.676 --> 25:04.764
- Right.
- Yeah.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.461
I was supposed
to get in and out,

25:06.505 --> 25:09.246
but they said something
about a shortage on syringes.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.118
Can't get to me
till later this afternoon.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.467
Oh.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.210
But the good news is
that I am free for lunch.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.429
You want to grab a sandwich?
- Mm-hmm.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.524
You know what, I am tired
of the same old, same old.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.222
There is a food truck out there
that I'd like to try.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.223
OK.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.843
Where's my angio patient?

25:46.022 --> 25:48.634
Are we all good?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.331
OK, let's do a run.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.726
What's going on here?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.728
Trying to get an angio done.

25:55.771 --> 25:56.903
I thought
we already established

25:56.946 --> 25:58.513
we can't do that
without contrast.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.602
I found a workaround
using CO2 instead.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.734
CO2?

26:01.777 --> 26:03.170
It works a lot
like a contrast.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.085
Yes, I'm aware, but
it's ten times as dangerous.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.739
If a gas bubble finds its way
up to his heart--

26:06.782 --> 26:08.828
We're injecting into
the arterial system, Crockett,

26:08.871 --> 26:10.307
below the diaphragm.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.961
We're all good.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.921
- Hold on.
- CO2 has been delivered.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.879
Look, right there.
That's the injury.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.100
Should we stent or go and open?

26:20.143 --> 26:21.710
- Damn it, drop the head.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.059
Sats are plummeting here, guys.

26:23.103 --> 26:24.278
80 and falling.
- What's going on?

26:24.321 --> 26:25.540
Vapor lock.
Move the C-arm.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.759
Move it.
Move it.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.977
A gas bubble is occluding
the venous return

26:28.021 --> 26:29.413
to the heart.
- But that's impossible.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.111
- Well, clearly not.
- Now down to 79.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.373
He's getting super tachy.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.679
Let's wire a catheter
up to his heart.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.506
No, no time.
We have to change his position.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.943
See if we can get the blood
past the bubble.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.597
Hope the CO2 reabsorbs.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.470
Put your hand on his back.
Give him a couple of pats.

26:42.513 --> 26:43.776
Right there.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.255
That's it.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.648
Come on, Julián.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.345
Come on, Julián.
Stay with me.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.742
Sats are back up.
91 and climbing.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.483
Vapor lock cleared.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.748
Oh, man.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.708
You're lucky
that didn't kill him.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.101
Let's set up to open.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.712
I don't get it, Crockett.

27:06.755 --> 27:09.497
How the hell did that bubble
find its way to his heart?

27:09.540 --> 27:11.107
We'll find out,

27:11.151 --> 27:13.849
but it's Dr. Marcel.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.507
I'm not sure
I'm reading this right,

27:19.550 --> 27:21.422
but her scan looks
completely clear.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.597
Yeah,
it's a surprise to me too.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.904
I was convinced
we'd find something.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.732
I'm so seldom wrong.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.256
Where is my son?
Where is he?

27:29.299 --> 27:30.344
- Jenny, Jenny.
- Come on.

27:30.387 --> 27:31.519
We're gonna get out of here.
- Jenny.

27:31.562 --> 27:32.563
Henry has a broken arm.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.174
Your son has
a broken arm, Jenny.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.697
- We need some help here!
- Jenny, listen--

27:35.741 --> 27:37.960
You said if I agreed
to that test, I'd be done.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.309
I am tired of waiting.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.702
You've got to let us
take care of your son.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.182
Four of Versed IM.
- Please!

27:42.225 --> 27:43.923
Listen to the doctors!
- Security!

27:43.966 --> 27:46.099
Just do as I say.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.754
Mom!
My chrysalis!

27:48.797 --> 27:49.842
- For God's sake.
- Whoa, whoa.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.017
Jenny, careful, careful.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.279
Watch it.

27:52.322 --> 27:53.193
Hurry up.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.760
No, let go of me!

27:54.803 --> 27:55.935
Let's put you back
in the bed, bud.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.023
It's okay.
She's okay. You're okay.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.546
- No!
- It'll be okay.

27:58.589 --> 27:59.547
No, no, no.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.726
Are you finally gonna
give me my court order?

28:11.472 --> 28:14.780
So DCFS will take
temporary custody of the boy

28:14.823 --> 28:15.955
until the mother's deemed ready

28:15.998 --> 28:17.957
to resume
her parental responsibilities.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.567
How long do you plan
to hold her for?

28:19.610 --> 28:21.438
72 hours, for now.

28:21.482 --> 28:24.398
Well, we'll just
take it day by day then.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.793
Dr. Asher, let's get her
prepped for transfer upstairs.

28:31.318 --> 28:35.496
OK, Henry, we are ready
to put a cast on that arm.

28:35.539 --> 28:36.627
Really important question.

28:36.671 --> 28:37.803
What color would you like?

28:37.846 --> 28:41.110
We can do green, purple, blue.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.721
Blue, I guess.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.157
Blue coming right up.

28:48.552 --> 28:52.295
Where did those people
take my mom?

28:52.339 --> 28:55.211
So your mom is gonna be
resting here in the hospital

28:55.255 --> 28:57.431
for a little while,
but when we're finished here,

28:57.474 --> 28:59.215
this nice woman
is gonna find you

28:59.259 --> 29:00.782
a cozy place
to sleep tonight.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.349
How does that sound?

29:02.392 --> 29:04.786
Hi, Henry.
My name is Madeline.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.577
You know, we can put that
in a specimen cup, if you like.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.162
I promise to keep it safe.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.433
Chest X-ray looks better.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.131
Airway pressures are down.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.786
It looks like
the bronch did the trick.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.962
Just like we should have done
from the beginning.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.443
Let's lighten his sedation.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.098
Come grab me when he's ready
to have the tube taken out.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.491
You got it.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.408
- Hey, Maggie.
- Oh, hey.

30:01.451 --> 30:04.498
Hey, sorry about lunch.
I just couldn't pull away.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.369
Yeah,
I saw you and Ben head out.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.807
Looked like you were trying
to keep him and Grant apart.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.939
That's 'cause I was.

30:10.983 --> 30:13.376
I haven't told Ben
about Grant yet.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.943
Oh.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.598
I feel bad for pressuring you
to join us earlier.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.252
It wasn't very sensitive of me.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.471
Look, I really don't want
to make anything strained

30:21.515 --> 30:23.299
between you and Ben.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.127
It's not your fault.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.086
It's just something
I have to deal with.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.743
OK, let's see
how bad the damage is.

30:35.659 --> 30:36.878
- Oh.
- Oh, man.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.967
Clamps.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.142
Suction.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.280
Okay.

30:47.323 --> 30:50.631
Yep, here's how the bubble
got to his heart.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.372
A fistula.
- What? Where?

30:52.415 --> 30:55.157
Do you see the mix
of dark and bright red blood?

30:55.201 --> 30:57.116
So the bullet hit
both the artery and the vein

30:57.159 --> 30:59.205
when it went between them,
fusing them together.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.989
Look.
You see that?

31:01.033 --> 31:03.165
That's how the CO2
got up there so fast.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.864
Yeah, like a superhighway
straight to the heart.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.735
Well, nobody could
have foreseen that.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.479
So the delusions,
the volatile mood swings.

31:12.522 --> 31:13.523
We could be looking
at some kind

31:13.567 --> 31:14.916
of atypical bipolar disorder.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.658
I mean, at this point,
it very well could be.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.703
We could start her
on a course of olanzapine

31:19.747 --> 31:20.922
and see how she responds.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.272
- You're moving her upstairs?
- Yeah.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.621
Millie, we might as well
get that going.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.014
OK.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.494
Hey, listen,
I pulled the tape

31:27.537 --> 31:29.017
from when Jenny
had that episode.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.497
You see how everything
just kind of falls

31:30.540 --> 31:33.630
off the ledge here,
her heart rate sats, her BP?

31:33.674 --> 31:34.718
Whatever's happening with her

31:34.762 --> 31:36.677
just has
to be physiological, right?

31:36.720 --> 31:37.896
It's what I've
been saying all along,

31:37.939 --> 31:39.419
but you know,
the scan came back clean.

31:39.462 --> 31:42.552
Well, we took this X-ray
of her chest upon intake.

31:42.596 --> 31:43.858
And you see
this area of haziness

31:43.902 --> 31:45.468
around her mediastinum?

31:45.512 --> 31:48.036
Is it just me, or does that
appear to be abnormally wide?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.038
- It's definitely wide.
- And there's no certain way

31:50.082 --> 31:51.866
to tell without more detail, but...

31:51.910 --> 31:53.128
Often caused by a tumor.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.695
And that can trigger
an autoimmune response

31:54.738 --> 31:56.697
in the brain, right,
like psychosis?

31:56.740 --> 31:59.047
Absolutely,
and would completely explain

31:59.091 --> 32:01.049
these dropouts
she's been having.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.618
Hey, Dr. Cuevas, could we hold
off on that transfer, please?

32:04.661 --> 32:07.664
Dr. Asher, nice work.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.277
Ophtho cleared you
to go home.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.756
I made you
a follow-up appointment

32:12.800 --> 32:14.933
a week from now,
but from what she says,

32:14.976 --> 32:16.238
you shouldn't have
any long-term issues

32:16.282 --> 32:17.326
with your vision.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.806
The patch stays on,
though, for now.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.590
- Thank you, Dr. Taylor.
- Yeah.

32:20.634 --> 32:23.463
OK, let's go over your
at-home and care instructions.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.117
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.730
Hey.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.298
I wanted to thank you again
for helping Keith out here.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.082
This is an ED, Grant.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.301
We would have done that
for anybody.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.346
Still, I just wanted
to let you know

32:37.390 --> 32:39.783
how much I appreciate it.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.830
The world works in funny ways,
doesn't it?

32:44.092 --> 32:47.313
You know, I really got
a lot of work to get done

32:47.356 --> 32:50.142
before my shift ends, so...

32:50.185 --> 32:52.622
Hey, Grant.
We're a little understaffed.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.103
Do you mind helping out
and wheeling out Keith for me?

32:55.147 --> 32:56.670
That's OK.
I can walk.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.063
- Hospital policy, sorry.
- No worries.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.716
I got it, Taylor.
- Thanks.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.718
All right,
let's get you home.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.242
Excuse me.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.113
Please, after you.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.550
Vanessa.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.248
So I'm finally done.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.945
Should I stick around
and give you a ride?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.034
Sure.
Thanks, babe.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.346
Al, can you hear me?

33:20.389 --> 33:22.000
OK.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.045
OK, we're gonna
take this tube out now

33:24.089 --> 33:27.135
by putting you on
a spontaneous breathing trial.

33:27.179 --> 33:31.792
So I want you to give me
some slow, deep breaths.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.272
All right?

33:35.752 --> 33:37.667
OK, that's right.
Slow and deep.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.541
Slow and deep.
Don't chase after it.

33:41.584 --> 33:42.716
The air will come.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.892
Just slow and deep.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.678
That's right.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.029
What's his RSBI reading?
- 130.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.074
Are you sure
you're reading that right?

33:53.118 --> 33:56.338
The vent says so,
and I calculated it as well.

33:56.382 --> 34:00.125
OK.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.910
- Hey, maybe we should stop.
- No, no, no, no, he can...

34:02.953 --> 34:04.781
He'll get there.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.483
All right.

34:10.526 --> 34:11.614
Let's put him on a rate.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.703
We'll resedate him.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.705
I'm sorry, Al.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.055
It's too soon to take you off.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.491
So we're gonna take
a couple of steps back,

34:18.534 --> 34:21.015
and we'll try again
a little later, OK?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.234
Please don't, Al. Al.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.496
No, no, no, no, Al.
Al, don't.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.888
- Get self-restraints, please.
- Al, stop.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.065
Put him back on Precedex.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.763
I'm sorry, Al, we're
gonna have to resedate you

34:29.806 --> 34:31.721
to ease your discomfort.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.901
I'm gonna get you
off this thing.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.251
I promise.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.306
So am I gonna
be able to walk?

34:51.350 --> 34:54.918
Walk, run, jump, whatever.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.183
When the ambo
was bringing me in,

34:58.226 --> 35:01.142
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.622
Thank you, Dr. Marcel.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.103
Let's not have to do
this again, all right?

35:05.146 --> 35:07.061
Thank you so much.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.889
You bet.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.069
So is this how it's gonna be?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.549
How what's gonna be?

35:16.592 --> 35:18.551
You taking credit
for everything.

35:18.594 --> 35:19.900
I was just as responsible
as you

35:19.943 --> 35:22.946
for saving that guy's life,
maybe more so.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.601
Really?
After that stunt you pulled?

35:25.645 --> 35:27.516
That stunt pointed us
directly to the problem

35:27.560 --> 35:28.952
and saved his leg.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.826
All day long,
you've been talking down to me.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.306
I was right
about the bullet holes.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.872
You never gave me props
for that.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.613
And then, you left it to me
to duke it out with Abrams

35:37.657 --> 35:38.875
over the contrast dye.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.312
You can't be serious
right now.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.532
All I'm asking for is
credit where credit's due.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.144
It's not that big a deal.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.580
You're right.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.103
I should have given you credit.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.365
I was very impressed

35:50.409 --> 35:54.239
with the way
you nearly killed our patient.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.529
Did I tell you lately
how much I love you?

36:25.661 --> 36:27.968
Ben, I need
to tell you something.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.100
I know. I know, you don't
really want to go bowling.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.624
- No.
- I can tell.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.495
You were a little lukewarm.
- No, it's not about that.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.283
About a month or so ago,

36:38.326 --> 36:40.241
I helped Vanessa

36:40.285 --> 36:44.724
with finding and reaching out
to her biological father.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.989
His name is Grant Young,
and he's an architect in town.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.165
OK.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.688
I didn't want
to tell you about it earlier

36:52.732 --> 36:55.343
because I didn't know
how you were gonna take it.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.347
I'm just wondering
why you're telling me this now.

36:59.391 --> 37:02.002
Because he came in
as a patient today.

37:02.045 --> 37:04.961
Not as a patient.
It was one of his employees.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.703
So he was here,
and you didn't mention that?

37:07.747 --> 37:09.444
Listen, I made it
very clear to Grant

37:09.488 --> 37:13.143
that I am not interested
in reconnecting with him

37:13.187 --> 37:14.667
in any way, shape, or form.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.759
Ben.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.717
You felt the need
to tell him that?

37:21.761 --> 37:25.852
No, I didn't want there
to be any confusion.

37:25.895 --> 37:29.290
And it's going good
between him and Vanessa.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.553
She seems happy.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.079
Glad to hear it.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.695
- Dr. Marcel?
- Hey.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.827
I was wondering
how today went

37:44.871 --> 37:48.309
with young Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.093
Yeah, fine.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.618
Not according to him.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.881
He filed a complaint
with HR and claimed

37:54.924 --> 37:57.362
you were disrespectful
and condescending.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.059
Did he now?

37:59.102 --> 38:02.671
And we are required to
take every complaint seriously,

38:02.715 --> 38:05.065
though I suspect
he must have done

38:05.108 --> 38:08.590
something pretty egregious
to raise your hackles.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.941
You care to file
a countercomplaint?

38:14.292 --> 38:15.945
No.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.207
You sure?

38:17.251 --> 38:20.080
I could have him reassigned.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.952
No, not necessary.

38:22.996 --> 38:24.911
I'm sure Dr. Tanaka-Reed
and myself

38:24.954 --> 38:27.914
will find some common ground
moving forward.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.830
Like you said, we're all
in this together, right?

38:34.442 --> 38:37.227
Hey, Doris said something
about Jenny being in surgery.

38:37.271 --> 38:40.405
Yeah, we located a small
tumor on her mediastinum.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.449
Daniel thinks
that might have been

38:41.493 --> 38:43.233
what caused the psychosis.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.278
Really?

38:46.411 --> 38:47.760
Mommy!

38:47.803 --> 38:50.153
My baby boy!

38:50.197 --> 38:51.981
Oh, look at your arm.

38:52.025 --> 38:55.420
I'm so sorry.

38:55.463 --> 38:56.812
It's OK.
It's OK.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.248
I'm OK.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.772
I thought you were trying
to hurt me and Henry.

38:59.815 --> 39:02.862
I'm--I didn't understand.
- It's all right.

39:02.905 --> 39:05.604
You're not gonna have to worry
about that anymore.

39:05.647 --> 39:09.608
Mommy, look,
my chrysalis.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.087
It turned into a butterfly.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.525
It's so beautiful.

39:23.578 --> 39:24.971
What's that?

39:25.014 --> 39:27.582
Your new best friend
for the next two weeks.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.677
Welcome to boot camp.

39:51.954 --> 39:55.218
I'm sure you already know
this about your old man,

39:55.262 --> 39:57.656
that...

39:57.699 --> 40:00.398
I've got a tendency
to override everything

40:00.441 --> 40:03.444
but the sound of my own voice.

40:03.488 --> 40:06.012
I don't know
if you have anything

40:06.055 --> 40:07.753
that you want to say to me
after all this time,

40:07.796 --> 40:10.190
but if there is...

40:12.714 --> 40:14.716
I'd like to try my best
to listen.
