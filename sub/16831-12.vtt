WEBVTT

00:09.761 --> 00:12.059
This way.

00:12.084 --> 00:13.651
Sit down here.

00:18.726 --> 00:20.260
So who are you?

00:20.295 --> 00:23.864
I'm Jessica Logan's husband.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.200
I don't know who that is,

00:26.234 --> 00:28.702
- and don't know who you are...
- I think you do.

00:28.736 --> 00:31.104
You saw me on the TV five years ago,

00:31.139 --> 00:34.575
begging for my wife's safe return.

00:34.609 --> 00:36.917
- Begging you.
- Okay, this... I'm out of here.

00:36.942 --> 00:37.978
Wait, please.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.914
Please.

00:43.685 --> 00:45.919
I'm not trying to drag you
back into court or anything.

00:45.954 --> 00:48.722
I just...

00:48.756 --> 00:50.290
I need to know.

00:50.325 --> 00:51.291
Know what?

00:51.326 --> 00:52.493
That it was you.

00:52.527 --> 00:54.595
Come on, man, get real.

00:54.629 --> 00:56.396
You're already locked
up on a double murder.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.131
You're never getting out, so.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.267
Then what difference does
it make what I say to you?

01:00.301 --> 01:04.271
None to you, everything to me.

01:04.305 --> 01:06.974
And if you did do it,

01:07.008 --> 01:09.142
don't you think you owe me that?

01:12.013 --> 01:13.947
All right.

01:16.684 --> 01:19.920
I know exactly who you are,

01:19.954 --> 01:22.155
Wyatt Logan.

01:22.190 --> 01:25.125
And I know who Jessica is too.

01:26.728 --> 01:29.429
And if I could change things?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.831
I would.

01:30.865 --> 01:32.366
But I can't.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.568
Neither of us can.

01:36.838 --> 01:39.573
Not unless I had a time machine.

01:45.246 --> 01:46.980
Hey, Mom.

01:47.015 --> 01:50.050
Ugh, God, please don't call me "Mom."

01:54.422 --> 01:55.656
Amy, is that...

01:55.690 --> 01:58.725
is that you, are...

01:58.760 --> 02:00.527
are you really here?

02:00.562 --> 02:01.630
No.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.397
I'm not really here.

02:03.431 --> 02:04.865
I'm gone.

02:04.899 --> 02:07.134
- What?
- Worse than gone.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.902
I don't even exist.

02:09.937 --> 02:11.805
And worst of all?

02:11.839 --> 02:13.240
You don't care.

02:13.274 --> 02:15.075
Of course I care.

02:15.109 --> 02:17.644
My God, you're like...
you're all I can think about.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.012
Really?

02:19.047 --> 02:20.581
Then what day was yesterday?

02:22.884 --> 02:25.085
I hope you're enjoying your little trips

02:25.119 --> 02:28.188
'cause I'm still lost.

02:28.222 --> 02:30.857
And I am never coming back.

02:30.892 --> 02:32.559
- No.
- And it's all your fault.

02:32.594 --> 02:34.194
I'm so sorry.

02:34.228 --> 02:35.862
I'm so sorry.

02:35.897 --> 02:37.764
Amy?

02:37.799 --> 02:38.932
Amy!

02:38.967 --> 02:40.167
Amy?

03:03.958 --> 03:05.726
What's going on?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.961
Oh, come on. Mason just told me.

03:07.996 --> 03:10.931
That I'm...

03:10.965 --> 03:13.867
gonna be the next Lifeboat pilot.

03:13.901 --> 03:15.369
What?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.870
Yeah, I mean, it's... it's early, right?

03:16.904 --> 03:18.138
I've only been here two years.

03:18.172 --> 03:20.774
And I hear training is brutal, and,

03:20.808 --> 03:23.143
honestly, whatever word
you put in to Connor for me,

03:23.177 --> 03:25.278
thank you.

03:25.313 --> 03:26.713
You deserve it.

03:27.902 --> 03:30.584
Mason. Mason.

03:30.618 --> 03:33.587
You're making Jiya the
next Lifeboat pilot?

03:33.621 --> 03:36.089
Well, her physics aptitude scores

03:36.124 --> 03:37.791
are on a par with yours, so, yes.

03:37.825 --> 03:40.627
You know what I mean.

03:40.662 --> 03:43.130
Our benefactors are insisting on it.

03:43.164 --> 03:45.899
She's to replace you in six months.

03:45.933 --> 03:47.668
Six months?

03:47.702 --> 03:50.303
Right, and you think
I'm gonna train her?

03:50.338 --> 03:51.972
Well, yes, it would
be easier if you did.

03:52.006 --> 03:53.607
But still, I think
we can cobble together

03:53.641 --> 03:55.409
a training regiment
that'll get the job done.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.576
You son of a bitch.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.811
Oh.

03:57.845 --> 04:00.781
What did you think would happen?

04:00.815 --> 04:03.517
That you'd get on your
proud, little soapbox,

04:03.551 --> 04:05.285
make your speech, and they'd just, what,

04:05.319 --> 04:07.621
slink away into the darkness?

04:10.158 --> 04:11.828
Please don't do this.

04:11.853 --> 04:14.528
You asked me to pick a side.

04:14.562 --> 04:16.029
Well, I did.

04:16.064 --> 04:18.964
Now, I suggest you
reconsider your allegiances

04:19.000 --> 04:22.169
because once she's trained,
you become expendable.

04:23.337 --> 04:24.604
Guys!

04:24.639 --> 04:25.706
Flynn just jumped.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.174
Where?

04:28.910 --> 04:30.944
April 3, 1882.

04:30.978 --> 04:32.345
It's the day that Jesse James died.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.953
Check it out, Rufus.

04:33.978 --> 04:36.650
He was planning a robbery
with Robert and Charles Ford.

04:36.684 --> 04:38.281
They're members of his gang.

04:38.306 --> 04:39.948
What he didn't know was that
they had already made a deal

04:39.973 --> 04:42.622
with the governor to double-cross
him for the reward money.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.890
And when they got the drop on him,

04:43.925 --> 04:46.293
they shot him in the back

04:46.327 --> 04:48.528
while he was dusting a painting.

04:48.563 --> 04:49.996
I always remembered that detail.

04:50.031 --> 04:52.499
So why's Flynn want Jesse James?

04:52.533 --> 04:54.000
Great psychos think alike?

04:54.035 --> 04:55.202
Well, there's only one way to find out.

04:55.236 --> 04:56.945
Off you go, cowboys.

05:02.009 --> 05:05.223
Lucy, you okay?

05:06.737 --> 05:07.937
Yeah.

05:13.278 --> 05:15.689
I don't know, I got doubts
about Platte City, Jesse.

05:15.723 --> 05:18.024
It's a big bank job
for just three people.

05:18.059 --> 05:19.475
Three?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.968
I count seven men in this room.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.899
"Witnesses said that during
the exchange of gunfire

05:25.933 --> 05:27.241
"with the lawmen on the train,

05:27.266 --> 05:29.236
"James fought with
the strength and vigor

05:29.270 --> 05:33.039
"of five men combined."

05:33.389 --> 05:35.444
Five,

05:35.469 --> 05:37.935
six, seven.

05:39.614 --> 05:41.915
Now, come on, Bob.

05:41.949 --> 05:44.384
You don't have to be a coward
every waking day of your life.

05:44.418 --> 05:47.287
You can grow a pair
of log-hanging fruit.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.995
That one never gets dusted.

06:14.081 --> 06:16.297
- Just saved your life.
- The hell did you do?

06:16.322 --> 06:18.151
Calm down. Look at their hands.

06:18.186 --> 06:19.920
They were gonna shoot you in the back.

06:19.954 --> 06:21.950
They made a deal with the governor.

06:21.975 --> 06:23.890
A full pardon for killing you.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.458
How do you know that?

06:25.483 --> 06:27.961
I overheard them bragging
about it at a bar.

06:27.995 --> 06:30.096
How rich they were gonna get.

06:30.131 --> 06:32.833
How you'd never see it coming.

06:32.867 --> 06:34.601
I've been tracking them ever since.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.610
Uh-huh.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.638
So you tracked them all the way here,

06:38.673 --> 06:40.640
and why would you pay
me such a kindness?

06:40.675 --> 06:43.009
For the famous Jesse James?

06:43.044 --> 06:44.611
'Cause I want to buy you a drink.

06:47.381 --> 06:49.249
And make you an offer.

06:54.054 --> 06:57.521

07:19.972 --> 07:22.462
- Is that, um...
- Robert Ford.

07:22.487 --> 07:23.768
And that's his brother.

07:23.793 --> 07:25.509
No sign of Jesse James,

07:25.544 --> 07:27.278
who was supposed to be dead.

07:27.312 --> 07:29.180
Flynn must have saved that wack job.

07:29.214 --> 07:31.949
So where would Flynn take Jesse James?

07:34.586 --> 07:37.084
That's a historical question
meant for the historian.

07:37.109 --> 07:38.405
Ah?

07:38.430 --> 07:39.857
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:39.897 --> 07:42.842
I don't know, I guess if you
grab a bank robber, maybe...

07:42.867 --> 07:44.962
because you need help robbing something?

07:58.877 --> 08:01.478
That's real deep in Indian Territory.

08:01.513 --> 08:03.147
They don't really
find our kind pleasant.

08:03.181 --> 08:05.149
Which is exactly why I need you.

08:05.183 --> 08:07.151
You know the area
better than anyone else.

08:07.185 --> 08:08.352
You're good with a gun.

08:08.386 --> 08:10.688
I ain't just good.

08:10.722 --> 08:12.189
I'm the best.

08:12.224 --> 08:14.425
Which is why I need you.

08:14.459 --> 08:17.394
So this is, what, a treasure map?

08:17.429 --> 08:19.096
Something like that.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.841
Well, what's the treasure?

08:30.742 --> 08:32.024
She recognizes you.

08:32.049 --> 08:34.445
I have an abundance of admirers.

08:35.102 --> 08:36.875
The treasure?

08:37.227 --> 08:38.916
It doesn't lead to money.

08:38.950 --> 08:40.251
It leads to someone.

08:40.284 --> 08:41.885
Someone?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.554
So there ain't no
gold, ain't no robbery,

08:43.587 --> 08:45.256
just a person at the end of this hell?

08:45.290 --> 08:46.727
What's so special about him?

08:46.752 --> 08:48.692
They're important to a
cause I'm fighting for.

08:48.727 --> 08:51.295
- Oh, yeah? What kind of cause?
- A patriotic one.

08:52.731 --> 08:54.031
Oh, God.

08:54.065 --> 08:56.000
Is there anything more dull?

09:06.668 --> 09:08.879
See, you should have lead with this.

09:08.914 --> 09:11.115
You'll get the rest of the
money when the job's complete.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.317
- Do we have a deal?
- Sure.

09:17.155 --> 09:19.323
Marshalls. We should head out the back.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.426
Hey, boys!

09:22.460 --> 09:24.261
What the hell are you doing?

09:27.532 --> 09:30.776
You looking for the
world-famous Jesse James?

09:35.640 --> 09:38.606
'Cause fortune has just smiled upon you.

09:39.002 --> 09:40.569
Hands in the air, now.

09:46.818 --> 09:49.253
Now we can go.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.708
Least they died looking
at something pretty.

10:13.244 --> 10:16.580
Guess it's safe to say Jesse
and Flynn have been through here.

10:19.084 --> 10:20.851
Bartender says they're headed south.

10:20.885 --> 10:22.219
Where you going?

10:22.253 --> 10:23.854
To buy some horses
so we can follow them.

10:23.888 --> 10:25.356
What, just, south?

10:25.390 --> 10:26.690
Through hostile Native American land?

10:26.725 --> 10:28.025
That's not exactly Google Maps, is it?

10:28.059 --> 10:30.330
- Well, we've survived worse.
- Barely.

10:30.355 --> 10:32.963
We won't make... Hey, stop.

10:32.998 --> 10:36.033
What part of "Jesse James is
killing people" don't you understand?

10:36.067 --> 10:37.595
People are dying that
are not supposed to die.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.837
And the longer he's alive, the
more he's gonna mess up history.

10:39.871 --> 10:42.055
And since when am I the one
worried about protecting history?

10:42.080 --> 10:43.571
Lucy, I don't know what
is going on with you,

10:43.596 --> 10:46.048
but you need to get your head
in the game, like right now.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.845
Sorry.

10:50.181 --> 10:52.750
Okay, well, every time I've
gone into hostile territory,

10:52.784 --> 10:54.885
I've gotten a local guide.

10:54.919 --> 10:56.253
So where do we find that?

10:59.524 --> 11:00.657
What?

11:04.046 --> 11:05.596
So this U.S. marshal is the guy

11:05.630 --> 11:07.364
that the Lone Ranger is based off of?

11:07.399 --> 11:08.899
That's what they say.

11:08.933 --> 11:13.070
Bass Reeves was responsible for
over 3,000 arrests during his career.

11:13.104 --> 11:15.205
Arguably the best
lawman in the old West.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.908
If he's that good, why doesn't
the town come to him for help?

11:29.054 --> 11:31.212
The Lone Ranger's black?

11:32.633 --> 11:34.445
That's...

11:34.959 --> 11:36.560
awesome.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.233
Go on, get.

11:50.441 --> 11:51.874
How many they kill?

11:52.113 --> 11:53.376
Four.

11:53.410 --> 11:54.944
Since this morning.

11:55.176 --> 11:57.714
Can't help you.

11:57.748 --> 11:59.871
- Can't or won't?
- Won't.

11:59.896 --> 12:01.932
We just told you that one of
the most wanted men in America,

12:01.957 --> 12:03.252
Jesse James, is on the loose.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.738
And I'm telling you I've got a
half dozen crimes I'm working on.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.071
He don't get pushed to the front
of the line because he's famous.

12:08.096 --> 12:10.211
There's plenty of other
marshals that can track him down.

12:10.245 --> 12:11.612
James went south,

12:11.647 --> 12:13.945
into Indian Territory.

12:14.305 --> 12:16.352
You used to live with
the Indians for years

12:16.377 --> 12:17.985
when you escaped bondage.

12:18.534 --> 12:21.489
They call you one of
their own, don't they?

12:21.523 --> 12:22.957
How do you know what I...

12:22.991 --> 12:24.593
If you don't do something,

12:24.618 --> 12:25.918
these two will carve a path

12:25.943 --> 12:27.817
through anyone who gets in their way,

12:27.842 --> 12:29.590
including the people on that land.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.325
People that lawmen won't help.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.707
Do you really think any other marshal

12:32.732 --> 12:35.012
is gonna care about that the way you do?

12:38.073 --> 12:40.208
Damn it.

12:40.242 --> 12:42.566
George! Come here.

12:43.264 --> 12:44.631
Yeah, Pa?

12:46.879 --> 12:49.550
You're the man of this house
while I'm gone, all right?

12:49.585 --> 12:51.619
Go round up your brothers and sisters.

12:55.224 --> 12:57.471
We do this my way. Understood?

12:57.496 --> 12:59.197
Yep. Whatever you want.

12:59.222 --> 13:00.916
As long as they catch
bullets in the end.

13:00.941 --> 13:02.261
Catch bullets?

13:02.286 --> 13:03.420
What the hell is wrong with y'all?

13:03.445 --> 13:05.079
This ain't the 1820s.

13:05.212 --> 13:07.179
We capture and bring 'em to justice.

13:07.214 --> 13:08.645
Alive.

13:09.282 --> 13:11.050
Understood?

13:13.286 --> 13:16.856
You want my help, I need your word, son.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.724
Do I have it?

13:21.728 --> 13:23.128
Yeah.

13:23.163 --> 13:24.897
Sure, we do it your way.

13:24.931 --> 13:26.468
Good.

13:28.101 --> 13:30.102
Now let's get you two armed up.

13:30.136 --> 13:31.832
What about me?

13:33.440 --> 13:36.308
I'm not in the business of
escorting women into danger, ma'am.

13:36.343 --> 13:39.912
Well, you're not escorting
me. I'm helping you.

13:39.946 --> 13:42.748
And no offense, but you don't
really have a choice in the matter.

13:48.321 --> 13:50.155
But not in that dress.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.057
Let's get you something proper to wear.

13:54.761 --> 13:56.395
Coordinates locked.

13:58.164 --> 13:59.558
Initiate.

14:05.305 --> 14:07.139
Come on.

14:07.173 --> 14:08.582
Alert. Alert.

14:08.607 --> 14:10.407
Trajectory miscalculation.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.379
Readjust. Readjust.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.617
Mission failure. Mission failure.

14:18.652 --> 14:19.685
Damn it.

14:24.558 --> 14:27.760
Well, it's true, you're dead, sadly.

14:27.794 --> 14:29.461
But still, hey,

14:29.496 --> 14:31.163
your takeoff was much better this time.

14:32.732 --> 14:34.099
Sticking the landing is the thing.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.701
I mean... I can't...

14:35.735 --> 14:37.303
How the hell does
Rufus do it every time?

14:37.337 --> 14:40.306
Hey, you'll get there. Just like he did.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.341
- Okay, let's go again.
- Hey, no-no-no.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.310
You've been at this for
hours. You need some rest.

14:44.344 --> 14:46.045
We'll get back to it tomorrow.

14:46.071 --> 14:48.173
- Hey, you know what would be a huge help?
- Hm?

14:48.198 --> 14:49.994
Video flight logs from the other pilots.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.318
Those were lost.

14:52.352 --> 14:55.621
Um, power surge wiped
them out in, uh, 2014.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.022
I bet I could recover them.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.464
You're a little busy at the moment.

14:58.491 --> 14:59.892
I'll put some people on it. Now, go.

14:59.926 --> 15:01.433
Get some sleep.

15:16.876 --> 15:19.178
I'm Grant Johnson.

15:21.448 --> 15:22.982
Who the hell are you?

15:23.016 --> 15:24.149
Hey, Bass!

15:24.184 --> 15:26.051
Yeah?

15:26.086 --> 15:27.319
Who in the hell are they?

15:27.354 --> 15:30.389
Righteous townfolk that aim to
bring down a criminal element.

15:30.423 --> 15:31.557
Townfolk?

15:31.591 --> 15:33.058
Hey.

15:33.093 --> 15:34.843
I think he's Tonto.

15:35.097 --> 15:36.624
The hell'd you just say?

15:36.649 --> 15:38.376
- Hey, Bass?
- Yeah?

15:38.401 --> 15:40.407
This one just called me a fool.

15:40.477 --> 15:42.267
Tried to hide it in Spanish.

15:42.302 --> 15:43.736
Maybe he's onto something.

15:45.071 --> 15:47.439
- "Tonto" means "fool" in Spanish.
- I know what it means.

15:47.474 --> 15:49.074
Whoever wrote "The Lone Ranger" sucks.

15:49.109 --> 15:51.253
No, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...

15:52.212 --> 15:54.513
- I'm Wyatt.
- Rufus.

15:54.547 --> 15:55.640
Grant.

15:55.665 --> 15:57.835
You want to come on in here
so I can tell you what for.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.251
Yeah, yeah.

16:01.621 --> 16:03.255
Dude,

16:03.289 --> 16:05.224
we're in a posse with the Lone Ranger.

16:05.258 --> 16:06.859
Yeah, well, don't get too excited.

16:06.893 --> 16:09.428
They're not gonna be happy
with us when this is all over.

16:09.462 --> 16:11.196
What's that mean?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.632
We're not gonna let
'em arrest Jesse James.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.750
I'm gonna shoot him myself.

16:17.637 --> 16:18.804
What?

16:19.320 --> 16:21.707
Well, one, you gave Bass your word,

16:21.741 --> 16:23.108
and, two, does the casualness

16:23.143 --> 16:25.210
with which we talk about
murder ever bother you?

16:25.245 --> 16:26.578
It's not murder.

16:26.613 --> 16:28.414
What is it?

16:28.896 --> 16:32.051
It's stopping a bad guy
from hurting good people.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.454
And, no, it doesn't bother me.

16:44.097 --> 16:45.230
Wow.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.833
Yeah. It's very Eastwood.

16:47.867 --> 16:49.501
A woman wearing pants.

16:49.536 --> 16:52.104
Wouldn't want a dress slowing us down.

16:58.044 --> 16:59.778
- Oh... oh.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

16:59.813 --> 17:02.014
Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.

17:02.048 --> 17:03.348
You sure?

17:03.383 --> 17:05.184
Yeah, yeah. I got it. Good.

17:05.218 --> 17:06.652
Okay.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.502
The West is a lot different
than I thought it would be.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.797
A lot more cold sores.

17:26.806 --> 17:30.149
Why is everyone looking at
us like they want to kill us?

17:30.266 --> 17:32.144
Because the two of us are black,

17:32.178 --> 17:33.478
and one's Indian.

17:33.503 --> 17:34.627
Huh.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.320
So it's like the scary
version of "Blazing Saddles."

17:40.153 --> 17:42.154
So we're gonna track James, right?

17:42.188 --> 17:44.123
Follow his horse's
footprints, stuff like that?

17:44.157 --> 17:45.241
Yes.

17:45.266 --> 17:47.434
And the broken twigs and
the scent in the wind.

17:47.727 --> 17:49.695
The spirits will guide us.

17:49.729 --> 17:50.963
Really?

17:50.997 --> 17:52.698
No, not really.

17:52.732 --> 17:55.300
We're gonna interview witnesses
to find out where they went

17:55.335 --> 17:57.859
'cause that's what we do, we're lawmen.

17:58.764 --> 18:00.569
Tontos.

18:04.844 --> 18:06.745
Hey, Seth,

18:07.544 --> 18:10.216
Mason asked if you could
check the simulator.

18:10.417 --> 18:11.827
It's running sluggish.

18:11.852 --> 18:14.387
Software just needs to be decompiled.

18:14.587 --> 18:16.088
His words.

18:16.122 --> 18:19.391
Cool. I'm on it.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.254
_

18:35.457 --> 18:36.879
_

18:41.781 --> 18:43.282
Jiya?

18:43.316 --> 18:44.583
What are you doing in here?

18:44.617 --> 18:46.218
Where... where's Seth?

18:46.553 --> 18:49.121
- Uh, working on the simulator.
- What?

18:49.155 --> 18:50.622
Yeah, it's running sluggish.

18:50.657 --> 18:52.624
Software just needs to be decompiled.

18:52.659 --> 18:54.760
And you're doing what?
Holding down the fort?

18:54.794 --> 18:56.395
Look, when I said you should go home,

18:56.429 --> 18:57.796
I wasn't asking.

18:58.028 --> 19:00.098
You do need sleep.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.800
Yeah, understood.

19:05.984 --> 19:07.272
Waitress saw them looking at a map.

19:07.307 --> 19:08.907
Was able to draw it.

19:08.942 --> 19:10.142
Looks like they're headed
into the Bluffwoods.

19:10.176 --> 19:11.743
Any idea why?

19:11.778 --> 19:13.004
No idea.

19:13.037 --> 19:15.255
Well, they've got a
good head start on us.

19:15.281 --> 19:16.887
We should get moving.

19:30.396 --> 19:32.664
We got a tail, three miles out.

19:33.099 --> 19:34.733
- How many?
- Five.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.602
Good thing there's six of us.

19:36.636 --> 19:38.470
What?

19:38.504 --> 19:40.939
Maybe hold off on the
gunfire until we lose them?

19:40.974 --> 19:42.597
Relax.

19:42.622 --> 19:44.176
We got time.

19:46.871 --> 19:49.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:49.182 --> 19:51.250
Where'd you get that rifle?

19:51.284 --> 19:52.651
You... you got to let me handle that.

19:52.685 --> 19:54.953
Later. We have to leave.

19:54.988 --> 19:56.521
Why?

19:56.556 --> 19:58.857
'Cause your cause is calling?

20:02.495 --> 20:05.097
You know, I got... I
got a question for you.

20:05.131 --> 20:07.099
What happens if you win this cause

20:07.133 --> 20:09.519
you're so quick to kill for?

20:14.007 --> 20:16.008
It'll be a better world.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.210
What happens if you don't win?

20:18.244 --> 20:19.623
Never occurred to me.

20:19.648 --> 20:22.347
See, it should. Fact that it
hasn't, that's your problem.

20:22.382 --> 20:24.483
Now, I can tell you think low of me,

20:24.517 --> 20:26.885
but rest assured,
brother, I used to be you.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.955
Just as grim and committed to
see the Confederacy prosper.

20:29.989 --> 20:32.357
I fought for it, killed for it.

20:32.392 --> 20:34.126
What's your point?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.795
I ended up on the
wrong side of that war.

20:36.829 --> 20:39.831
Grand Confederacy's all gone.

20:39.866 --> 20:43.068
But I just keep right on
killing. You know why that is?

20:43.102 --> 20:45.541
Because deep down, a killer
is what I always wanted to be.

20:45.566 --> 20:46.979
I just needed an excuse.

20:47.004 --> 20:49.400
You know what another
word for "excuse" is?

20:50.243 --> 20:51.710
Cause.

20:51.744 --> 20:53.345
Are you saying that's me?

21:14.501 --> 21:16.312
Not too happy to see us.

21:16.337 --> 21:18.103
We're on their land.

21:18.137 --> 21:20.005
So what's the plan?

21:20.039 --> 21:22.007
Plan is...

21:23.776 --> 21:26.857
I show you why it was such a
good idea to bring me along.

21:51.807 --> 21:54.208
They need to be buried.

21:54.243 --> 21:56.377
Yes. They do.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.549
Head back and tell your
friends we're setting up camp.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.017
We should keep moving.

22:03.051 --> 22:05.463
They have to rest their
horses just like we do.

22:18.457 --> 22:20.871
Need any help with your, uh,

22:21.770 --> 22:23.410
with your ritual?

22:23.435 --> 22:27.129
Man, you still got it stuck
in your head I'm full Injun.

22:27.154 --> 22:28.476
You're not?

22:28.510 --> 22:30.745
Blood's mixed so I'm a lot of things.

22:30.779 --> 22:34.548
Some black, some white,
some Creek Indian.

22:34.583 --> 22:38.735
So the only place I've
ever really belonged

22:39.554 --> 22:42.556
was with that sumbitch over there.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.962
Jesse James is wanted dead or alive.

22:47.996 --> 22:49.730
Are we really just going to capture him?

22:49.765 --> 22:51.132
It's what's right.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.471
Yeah, it's just...
you're risking your life

22:53.496 --> 22:58.065
when shooting him on sight
would be a little bit easier.

22:58.517 --> 23:00.289
Who the hell ever said...

23:00.314 --> 23:02.877
"easy" and "right" were the same thing?

23:03.455 --> 23:04.946
Look, I'm not saying

23:04.980 --> 23:07.014
that I'm some sort of hero or anything.

23:07.376 --> 23:09.176
I've killed several men.

23:09.201 --> 23:10.751
But the thing is that

23:10.786 --> 23:13.254
I see them every time I close my eyes.

23:13.288 --> 23:16.123
Every time I look in the mirror.

23:16.158 --> 23:19.327
And I think you know exactly...

23:19.361 --> 23:20.828
what I'm talking about.

23:25.367 --> 23:28.102
Can I ask you a question?

23:28.136 --> 23:29.704
It bother you that

23:29.738 --> 23:31.505
not long ago you were in bondage,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.874
and now, here you are, fighting so hard

23:33.909 --> 23:36.146
for your old masters' law?

23:36.171 --> 23:37.945
Law ain't perfect.

23:38.448 --> 23:40.848
But it's all we got.

23:41.096 --> 23:42.850
If we ain't got that,

23:42.884 --> 23:44.518
we ain't got nothing.

23:54.239 --> 23:56.670
These are good men.

23:57.273 --> 23:58.666
We can't double-cross them.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.901
So, what, we put Jesse James in jail?

24:00.936 --> 24:02.737
Is that your big plan?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.905
He can't hurt anyone else if he's dead,

24:04.940 --> 24:06.407
like he's supposed to be.

24:06.433 --> 24:07.538
What is with you?

24:07.563 --> 24:09.910
You have been wound tight
since before we got here.

24:09.945 --> 24:11.178
I'm fine.

24:11.213 --> 24:14.415
Spoken in a way that is far from fine.

24:18.687 --> 24:20.588
I saw him.

24:20.622 --> 24:22.289
I talked to him.

24:23.291 --> 24:26.227
- Talked to who?
- Jessica's killer.

24:27.062 --> 24:29.000
Flynn gave me the name.

24:29.731 --> 24:31.819
Just like he promised.

24:31.844 --> 24:33.176
Did he admit it?

24:35.588 --> 24:38.539
He murdered two other
women besides Jessica.

24:38.573 --> 24:40.821
If I could go back and put a
bullet in his head and stop him,

24:40.846 --> 24:43.072
I wouldn't think twice.

24:44.946 --> 24:46.795
Look, Wyatt, I...

24:46.820 --> 24:50.217
can't even imagine what it's like to...

24:50.252 --> 24:52.453
It's just...

24:52.487 --> 24:55.696
you know the guy I shot in Houston?

24:59.561 --> 25:01.649
It's been hard.

25:02.915 --> 25:06.801
Maybe killing shouldn't
be an everyday thing.

25:06.835 --> 25:10.704
Maybe it should be harder

25:10.739 --> 25:13.044
for the good guys.

25:14.009 --> 25:15.709
And Bass is right.

25:15.744 --> 25:18.279
It's getting harder
to look in the mirror.

25:18.734 --> 25:22.283
How far are we willing to go?

25:22.317 --> 25:24.118
What we're doing, it's right.

25:24.152 --> 25:26.087
I'm sure Flynn tells
his guys the same thing.

25:26.121 --> 25:29.056
You want to back me up here?

25:29.091 --> 25:31.425
I don't know if I can.

25:31.888 --> 25:35.129
Yesterday was my sister's birthday.

25:35.163 --> 25:36.564
I didn't remember.

25:36.598 --> 25:37.765
Yeah, but...

25:37.799 --> 25:39.333
I should have remembered because

25:39.367 --> 25:40.634
I'm the only person on the planet

25:40.669 --> 25:43.270
that ever knew she existed.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.473
Flynn, crazy as he is,

25:45.507 --> 25:47.108
seems to be telling the truth.

25:47.142 --> 25:50.228
Rittenhouse is real,
and it is dangerous.

25:51.113 --> 25:52.847
Who's to say what's
right and wrong anymore?

25:52.881 --> 25:54.248
All right, listen up, both of you.

25:54.282 --> 25:55.683
We have a job to do.

25:55.717 --> 25:57.651
I don't want to do this job anymore.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.859
I want my sister back.

26:01.022 --> 26:02.957
I want to go home.

26:33.655 --> 26:35.189
What in the hell is this place?

26:35.223 --> 26:36.724
Shh.

26:39.261 --> 26:40.394
You lay down some cover fire and I'll...

26:40.428 --> 26:42.300
You won't do a damn thing.

26:43.698 --> 26:46.133
I'm not your enemy!

26:46.168 --> 26:47.668
I'm from the same place you are!

26:47.702 --> 26:49.858
I have a ship! I can take you to it!

26:49.883 --> 26:51.608
What the hell are you talking about?

26:51.633 --> 26:52.740
Listen!

26:52.774 --> 26:54.875
They're two of us, we could
have taken you out already,

26:54.910 --> 26:56.577
but we don't want to.

26:56.611 --> 26:58.694
We're coming out now.

26:58.843 --> 27:00.714
Just put the gun down!

27:06.388 --> 27:08.462
Just want to talk.

27:10.292 --> 27:12.159
Alone.

27:12.806 --> 27:14.428
Wait a minute.

27:14.462 --> 27:16.910
All this fuss for a woman?

27:16.935 --> 27:18.716
- Just wait here.
- The hell I will.

27:18.741 --> 27:20.234
You want the rest of your money?

27:20.268 --> 27:23.437
This is a private
conversation. Go get the horses.

27:48.737 --> 27:52.573
Well, you sure aren't
from around here, are you?

27:57.573 --> 27:59.465
Draw a map to the ship.

27:59.528 --> 28:02.296
I can take you to the ship.

28:02.331 --> 28:03.631
I can take you home.

28:03.665 --> 28:05.066
I'm not going home.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.467
Draw the map.

28:06.502 --> 28:08.970
I... I need you to listen to me.

28:09.004 --> 28:11.239
I'm not from Mason Industries,

28:11.273 --> 28:14.196
which means I'm not from Rittenhouse.

28:14.676 --> 28:16.241
That's right.

28:16.266 --> 28:18.618
I know a lot about you, Emma.

28:19.446 --> 28:24.018
I know everything about what
you did for Mason Industries.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.687
My name is Emma Whitmore,

28:26.722 --> 28:31.659
and I get to pilot
this beauty right here.

28:31.693 --> 28:32.693
Here she is.

28:32.728 --> 28:34.195
You and Anthony Bruhl

28:34.229 --> 28:36.330
were the first ones
they ever sent through,

28:36.365 --> 28:38.800
to travel through time.

28:38.834 --> 28:42.112
You should be up there with the
likes of Glenn and Armstrong.

28:44.132 --> 28:45.832
You did it!

28:48.850 --> 28:50.127
Bloody wonderful!

28:52.314 --> 28:54.282
But then something happened.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.551
Rittenhouse happened.

28:56.585 --> 28:58.486
They enlisted you.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.821
Threatened the people you loved

28:59.855 --> 29:01.489
if you refused to help them.

29:01.523 --> 29:02.857
Uh, Emma?

29:02.891 --> 29:04.392
- You trailed off.
- Oh, sorry.

29:04.426 --> 29:07.361
Sorry. I'm just... tired.

29:07.396 --> 29:08.996
It took its toll on you,

29:09.031 --> 29:10.665
the things Rittenhouse told you,

29:10.699 --> 29:12.956
the things they must have made you do.

29:12.981 --> 29:15.336
So you found a way out.

29:15.786 --> 29:19.006
Um, Pilot Whitmore was lost

29:19.041 --> 29:20.675
in the operation.

29:20.709 --> 29:23.178
Her body couldn't be recovered due to

29:23.203 --> 29:26.547
the unmanageable
circumstances described by...

29:26.582 --> 29:28.883
the other pilot, Anthony Bruhl.

29:29.292 --> 29:30.855
We lost her.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.888
She's gone.

29:36.592 --> 29:39.114
You faked your own death
and hid in the past,

29:39.139 --> 29:40.988
where Rittenhouse would
never be able to find you.

29:41.013 --> 29:44.832
And Anthony knew, but kept your secret.

29:46.068 --> 29:48.402
How long you been hiding out here?

29:49.268 --> 29:51.105
God, it's been a decade now.

29:51.139 --> 29:53.007
Alone, this whole time.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.242
I had no choice.

29:54.276 --> 29:55.877
I had to run.

29:55.911 --> 29:57.445
I ran too.

29:57.479 --> 29:59.847
After they killed my family.

30:00.430 --> 30:02.617
But then one day I realized

30:02.651 --> 30:04.453
that I couldn't run anymore,

30:04.478 --> 30:05.753
that I had to fight.

30:05.787 --> 30:07.522
No, it doesn't matter.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.289
You have no idea what you're up against.

30:09.314 --> 30:11.926
Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.

30:12.139 --> 30:15.491
No. You don't, actually.

30:16.598 --> 30:19.400
I know things that Anthony doesn't know,

30:19.434 --> 30:22.236
that nobody knows.

30:22.271 --> 30:24.939
The things that they have
planned for that machine.

30:24.973 --> 30:27.775
But that's why I'm here, why
I came so far to find you.

30:27.809 --> 30:30.578
I need to know what
you know to stop them.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.614
Look, I'm not gonna force you.

30:33.649 --> 30:36.343
You can hide here, in Frontierland,

30:36.368 --> 30:37.485
but if you do,

30:37.519 --> 30:40.321
anyone you've ever loved...

30:40.355 --> 30:42.990
will be destroyed by Rittenhouse.

30:49.331 --> 30:51.432
You and the missus all friendly now?

30:51.466 --> 30:53.301
Something like that.

30:53.335 --> 30:56.571
But I'm afraid that this is
where we part ways, Jesse.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.420
How you gonna get out of here?

30:58.445 --> 31:00.272
She knows the way.

31:01.515 --> 31:03.844
Second half of your money.

31:03.879 --> 31:05.719
And I have a bonus for you.

31:05.744 --> 31:07.081
Oh, yeah, what's that?

31:07.115 --> 31:09.784
You know that posse
that's been on our trail?

31:09.818 --> 31:12.787
Well, I've neglected to
mention who was leading it.

31:12.821 --> 31:15.623
Bass Reeves.

31:15.657 --> 31:18.017
- You've heard of him.
- I have.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.668
I bet taking out the
greatest lawman in the West

31:20.696 --> 31:22.763
would make quite the headlines.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.236
Sure as hell would make me popular

31:24.261 --> 31:26.329
with a certain set of
righteous Americans.

31:30.233 --> 31:32.726
Well, happy trails, Jesse.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.344
One more thing.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.435
Do you really want to take
your chances against me?

31:41.460 --> 31:43.292
You know how fast I am.

31:43.317 --> 31:45.886
What is this? What do you want?

31:45.911 --> 31:48.192
Just one more little bonus.

31:52.509 --> 31:54.428
Listen,

31:54.463 --> 31:55.563
I can't leave this with you...

31:55.597 --> 31:57.568
The bonus is non-negotiable.

32:16.284 --> 32:17.934
Thank you, kindly.

32:27.295 --> 32:29.504
Flynn!

32:29.529 --> 32:32.033
When your cause fails,

32:32.067 --> 32:35.603
and you find yourself
drifting a little more my way,

32:35.637 --> 32:37.571
look me up.

32:37.606 --> 32:39.373
I'll be waiting.

33:11.873 --> 33:14.064
What the hell?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.906
What on earth is all this stuff?

33:26.931 --> 33:29.457
It's a hell of a good question, Rufus.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.995
Oh, my God.

33:35.389 --> 33:36.671
Emma.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.367
She's supposed to be dead.

33:43.339 --> 33:44.705
Hey.

33:45.136 --> 33:46.674
What is that?

33:46.708 --> 33:48.375
Get down!

33:57.349 --> 33:58.819
Whoo-hoo!

33:58.854 --> 34:00.688
Sounds like a damn Gatling gun!

34:00.722 --> 34:02.823
Whoo!

34:02.858 --> 34:04.658
Yeah!

34:08.001 --> 34:09.301
Is everybody okay?

34:09.326 --> 34:11.398
Grant! I need you over at this window.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.635
Grant!

34:16.938 --> 34:18.405
Grant's been shot!

34:22.511 --> 34:25.312
Here, here.

34:25.347 --> 34:26.882
All right.

34:29.799 --> 34:31.132
Hey, Bass?

34:31.158 --> 34:33.020
Yeah, yeah?

34:33.054 --> 34:35.856
I should be dead, but I ain't.

34:35.891 --> 34:37.135
It's gonna stay that way.

34:39.176 --> 34:42.174
That's the first time
I ever heard you lie.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.214
Might I have the pleasure of knowing

34:44.239 --> 34:46.433
who's inside that there cabin?

34:46.467 --> 34:49.503
U.S. Federal Marshal Bass Reeves!

34:49.538 --> 34:51.505
I'm Jesse James!

34:51.540 --> 34:53.558
It is a pleasure!

34:53.583 --> 34:56.268
- Man, have I heard about you.
- Where's Wyatt?

34:56.293 --> 34:57.964
You're supposed to
be so fast with a Colt

34:57.989 --> 35:00.614
you've been banned from every
shooting contest in the plains!

35:00.649 --> 35:02.748
It is a rare challenge
to face against you, sir.

35:05.453 --> 35:07.087
Oh, my God.

35:07.122 --> 35:08.622
You do not shut up.

35:08.657 --> 35:10.357
Pretty sure you ain't Marshal Reeves.

35:10.392 --> 35:11.625
Yeah.

35:11.660 --> 35:12.740
Now hold on.

35:15.096 --> 35:17.198
Holster it.

35:17.232 --> 35:18.766
Marshal Bass Reeves?

35:18.800 --> 35:20.801
I wish to surrender...

35:20.836 --> 35:22.203
willingly and unconditionally...

35:22.237 --> 35:23.971
Quiet!

35:24.005 --> 35:25.143
Holster it.

35:25.168 --> 35:26.640
No, I can't do that.

35:26.675 --> 35:28.370
Yes, you can.

35:29.010 --> 35:30.942
He just shot your friend.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.881
He didn't just shoot him.

35:33.915 --> 35:35.449
He killed him.

35:37.281 --> 35:38.419
Holster it!

35:38.444 --> 35:40.254
Wait, wait.

35:46.628 --> 35:47.828
I'm unarmed.

35:47.863 --> 35:49.496
I'm wounded.

35:49.531 --> 35:51.665
- And I surrender.
- We take him to jail.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.442
- He'll see justice.
- He'll escape.

35:54.656 --> 35:56.090
He'll kill more people.

35:56.115 --> 35:57.387
- Wyatt...
- We got to be sure.

35:57.412 --> 35:58.621
Look at me.

35:58.646 --> 36:00.191
You have a choice, son.

36:25.254 --> 36:26.977
_

36:47.111 --> 36:48.512
What's this?

36:48.853 --> 36:51.263
Reward money for Jesse James,

36:51.288 --> 36:53.155
wanted dead or alive.

36:53.180 --> 36:54.588
No.

36:54.955 --> 36:57.629
Give it to Grant's
family. They could use it.

37:00.024 --> 37:01.758
Hey.

37:01.793 --> 37:05.329
We did something good.
You should be thanking us.

37:05.735 --> 37:06.797
Killing an injured man

37:06.831 --> 37:09.006
when he plain said he
wished to surrender?

37:09.031 --> 37:10.467
That's a lot of things.

37:10.758 --> 37:12.607
Good ain't one of them.

37:14.225 --> 37:16.045
And you'll live with it.

37:19.677 --> 37:21.044
Uh, Marshal Reeves?

37:21.079 --> 37:22.679
I'm with the "Missouri Star."

37:22.714 --> 37:24.481
Got word of a posse led by you

37:24.515 --> 37:26.632
just brought Jesse James to justice.

37:26.657 --> 37:29.665
- Is that true?
- No. It ain't.

37:32.390 --> 37:34.024
Hey, Bass,

37:34.058 --> 37:35.158
Bass,

37:35.193 --> 37:36.526
you should talk to him.

37:36.561 --> 37:39.121
Wait... you should talk
to a lot of reporters.

37:39.146 --> 37:40.361
Why?

37:40.386 --> 37:43.213
Because if you don't tell your
story, someone else might...

37:44.435 --> 37:48.105
some white dick in a mask might
end up the legend instead of you.

37:51.943 --> 37:54.411
People are gonna want
to know your story.

37:54.445 --> 37:56.713
Today, tomorrow,

37:57.295 --> 37:59.548
maybe even 100 years from now.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.404
I'm not doing this for them.

38:26.773 --> 38:28.712
Emma's alive?

38:28.746 --> 38:30.947
My God.

38:30.982 --> 38:33.350
Uh... Bruhl said he saw her die.

38:33.819 --> 38:35.185
He must have covered for her.

38:35.219 --> 38:37.369
But Flynn already has a pilot.

38:37.394 --> 38:39.996
Why go through all of this
trouble to get another one?

38:42.827 --> 38:45.962
Ah, rested and ready for today's lesson?

38:45.997 --> 38:47.364
Yeah, I, uh,

38:47.398 --> 38:49.066
I think I finally fixed
that latency issue.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.902
Ah, and, uh, hacking in
and viewing the video logs,

38:51.936 --> 38:54.571
was it helpful or did it hurt?

38:56.107 --> 38:58.585
- Uh...
- I'm insulted you're surprised.

38:58.610 --> 39:00.711
I have safeguards all over this facility

39:00.745 --> 39:03.747
installed by and known only to me.

39:05.783 --> 39:07.651
I don't understand why
you didn't just tell me.

39:07.685 --> 39:09.653
I did it for your own protection.

39:09.687 --> 39:12.132
So, what, you thought I couldn't handle
it, what happened to Emma Whitmore?

39:12.157 --> 39:14.664
I didn't want you to be discouraged.

39:15.159 --> 39:17.494
Or afraid.

39:17.528 --> 39:20.063
That every time you
step into that machine,

39:20.379 --> 39:23.286
there isn't room for
even the slightest error.

39:24.035 --> 39:25.435
If you think that scares me,

39:25.470 --> 39:27.803
then you don't know me very well.

39:33.181 --> 39:35.479
Try to deceive me again,

39:35.513 --> 39:39.149
and we'll see how scared you get.

39:40.885 --> 39:42.452
Go on.

39:52.011 --> 39:53.145
Powering up.

39:53.170 --> 39:54.804
Ready when you are.

40:31.602 --> 40:33.637
I'm good, thanks.

40:33.671 --> 40:36.072
Got your text.

40:36.624 --> 40:38.508
I loved westerns.

40:39.030 --> 40:40.997
That's all I watched when I was a kid.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.423
Gary Cooper and John Wayne.

40:45.383 --> 40:48.718
They never crossed the line.

40:48.753 --> 40:50.587
Good and bad, black and white.

40:50.621 --> 40:53.444
There was a code, you know?

40:54.483 --> 40:57.027
And then I go to war,

40:57.061 --> 40:59.996
and all I can think about...

41:00.031 --> 41:02.566
is, "My God.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.435
"Those flicks are a bunch of crap."

41:08.406 --> 41:11.508
Because nobody is that good.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.243
And then we meet this Bass guy,

41:13.277 --> 41:15.388
and he really was that good.

41:15.413 --> 41:17.414
What are you saying?

41:20.828 --> 41:24.721
I want you to help me steal
the time machine to save Jess.

41:27.058 --> 41:29.395
You want me to do what?

41:29.840 --> 41:30.978
- No.
- Rufus...

41:31.003 --> 41:33.563
Wyatt, I can't do that.

41:33.598 --> 41:36.081
I'm not helping you...

41:36.106 --> 41:38.301
kill someone else.

41:38.336 --> 41:39.970
I'm not asking you to do that.

41:40.004 --> 41:41.972
I'm asking you to help me
figure out another way...

41:41.997 --> 41:44.724
... To erase someone from existence.

41:44.749 --> 41:46.276
Rufus, the man who killed Jessica

41:46.310 --> 41:48.545
killed two other women.

41:48.610 --> 41:51.067
I'm trying to stop a bad man...

41:51.092 --> 41:53.427
from hurting good people.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.360
Please, help me.

42:03.534 --> 42:05.518
I have no one else.

42:08.035 --> 42:11.037
Will you help me save my wife?

42:12.516 --> 42:16.930
