24:24.506 --> 24:28.085

BLAIR: But I'm just saying that,
right at the outset.

24:33.144 --> 24:36.842
But the reason why I'm taking
this action is that my worry is,

24:36.942 --> 24:38.842
if the terrorists are able

24:38.942 --> 24:42.201
to get hold of
even worse material

24:42.301 --> 24:43.960
than they used
in the bomb in Bali,

24:44.060 --> 24:47.879
you could be talking not about
several hundred people dying,

24:47.979 --> 24:49.919
but several thousand people
dying,

24:50.019 --> 24:52.118
perhaps even more than that,
and that's why I'm doing it.

24:52.218 --> 24:56.117
Look, who would want to be in
the position of going to war?

24:56.217 --> 24:59.116
But if I actually believe

24:59.216 --> 25:00.836
and genuinely believe

25:00.936 --> 25:03.155
that there is a real risk,

25:03.255 --> 25:05.194
because we know
these terrorists groups,

25:05.294 --> 25:08.353
the sort that perpetrated
that, um, atrocity in Bali,

25:08.453 --> 25:10.553
are trying to get hold
of these weapons.

25:10.653 --> 25:13.432
If we don't take action
against this threat now,

25:13.532 --> 25:15.231
the risk is not that...

25:15.331 --> 25:18.630
..not that innocent people
die, simply,

25:18.730 --> 25:20.950
but that they die
on a huge scale,

25:21.050 --> 25:22.309
and that's what worries me.

25:22.409 --> 25:24.469
Now, there are no easy choices
in this situation

25:24.569 --> 25:27.188
and there is no, you know,
moral high ground

25:27.288 --> 25:30.387
that one side owns
and the other side doesn't.

25:30.487 --> 25:34.906

every single day across my desk.

25:35.006 --> 25:37.345

of these terrorist groups,

25:37.445 --> 25:39.145
the sorts that are in Europe
at the moment,

25:39.245 --> 25:40.704
the sorts that did that in Bali,

25:40.804 --> 25:42.903
though Bali had nothing to do
with the war against terror.

25:43.003 --> 25:45.583
But until we start asking these
people why they hate us so much,

25:45.683 --> 25:47.582
we're not going to find out
the cause for this.

25:47.682 --> 25:49.901

weapons of mass destruction.
