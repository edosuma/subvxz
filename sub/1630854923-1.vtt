00:39.998 --> 00:42.834
Wo ye ye ye ye ye ye

00:48.131 --> 00:53.261
You are good, you are kind
You are more than these

00:53.970 --> 00:58.558
I'm lost for words
Trying to describe you

00:59.893 --> 01:04.481
Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi

01:05.982 --> 01:09.694
Your greatness is all I see

01:10.862 --> 01:15.575
There is nothing you cannot do

01:16.743 --> 01:21.456
There's no mountain you cannot move

01:21.956 --> 01:27.796
If you have said it
Then you will do it

01:27.879 --> 01:33.343
'Cos you have a track
Record of keeping your word

01:33.426 --> 01:38.932
And you're not about
To stop doing it now

01:39.933 --> 01:45.063
-Olorun agbaye oh
-You are mighty oh

01:45.146 --> 01:50.568
-Olorun agbaye oh

-Olorun agbaye oh
-You are mighty oh

02:17.887 --> 02:19.430
You are mighty…

02:27.105 --> 02:28.273
Speak up!

02:30.733 --> 02:34.988
I'm sorry. I--

02:35.071 --> 02:36.614
Who did this?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.784
Who did it?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.123
Amanda…

02:47.333 --> 02:48.418
Please…

02:48.501 --> 02:51.462
Don't tell me you don't know who did this.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.017
Please…

03:04.100 --> 03:06.019
Tell us who got you pregnant.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.021
It doesn't matter anymore.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.648
It doesn't matter.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.525
But Ab we have to know who did--

03:12.609 --> 03:14.235
I said it doesn't matter!

03:15.445 --> 03:17.196
She's not pregnant.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.285
Um… Ab you see, no matter
how positive you want to be--

03:22.368 --> 03:25.413
I said she is not pregnant.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.498
What's wrong with you?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.001
Look, look here you…

03:30.084 --> 03:34.088
You will do another test.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.425
We will go to a
hospital far away from here…

03:37.508 --> 03:39.719
where nobody knows us.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.890
We will get the doctors…

03:45.558 --> 03:47.810
to do whatever they need to do.

03:49.395 --> 03:53.441
To ensure that the result
comes out negative.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.694
And it stays like that.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.738
-But--
-It will stay like that.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.534
I should abort?

04:03.618 --> 04:04.619
Shut up!

04:08.539 --> 04:09.582
Abort?

04:10.875 --> 04:12.752
I said you are not pregnant.

04:15.213 --> 04:19.050
No, no, I can't do it.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.094
I can't do it.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.013
I'm begging you. Please, please…

04:24.097 --> 04:25.348
What did you say?

04:26.891 --> 04:27.809
You can't?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.395
Look at her, just look at her…

04:31.813 --> 04:32.897
Rascal.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.691
Stray dog… "I can't"

04:35.275 --> 04:36.943
You will do it as I've said it.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.947
Because of you
everything that I have worked for…

04:41.030 --> 04:42.448
All my life.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.827
Everything that we have been
praying for as a family,

04:45.910 --> 04:47.620
Everything at stake now.

04:48.162 --> 04:52.834
Do you think that the church
will still post me to Netherlands,

04:52.917 --> 04:54.460
with this madness?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.172
Idiot.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.257
"I can't"

05:01.426 --> 05:04.387
Father… please, please…

05:04.470 --> 05:07.473
Please.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.599
It's not right.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.185
It's not right.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.481
Oh, you know what is not right?

05:16.649 --> 05:17.984
You know what is not right.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.863
When you were opening
your legs for that lunatic.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.657
You know what? You--

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411
What is it?

05:28.494 --> 05:30.371
-My husband! My husband!
-Daddy, daddy.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.041
-Daddy, daddy sorry.
-Daddy, daddy.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.001
-You see what you've done.
-Daddy, daddy.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.377
-Can you see what you've done.
-Daddy, daddy…

05:36.461 --> 05:38.337
-Go and get the doctor. Call the doctor.
-Sorry!

05:38.421 --> 05:40.131
-Daddy I'm sorry.
-Go and call the doctor.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.952
Excuse me, daddy…

06:10.661 --> 06:11.829
Mummy.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.374
Good afte… Good afternoon.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.501
Why have you come?

06:18.336 --> 06:21.839
Have you forgotten what the
doctor said about your father?

06:22.381 --> 06:24.717
His heart and stressful situations?

06:25.384 --> 06:26.427
Mummy please.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.638
That's your major problem.
You never listen.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.600
Why can't you just be
like your sister Muna?

06:33.851 --> 06:34.811
Go.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.604
Mary.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.483
Let her come in.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.610
Daddy, daddy.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.362
Daddy please I'm sorry.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.406
Don’t call me daddy.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.746
If you ever want to call me
daddy again then you must repent.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.415
And purge yourself…

06:57.083 --> 06:58.167
of…

06:58.835 --> 07:00.253
of that…

07:01.504 --> 07:02.713
iniquity.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.818
Daddy I can't.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.820
Then you have made your choice.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.532
Daddy please, daddy please.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.784
I do not want to see you…

07:31.868 --> 07:34.495
In my house when I come back.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.915
Muna… Muna please, mummy.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.250
Mummy please, mummy.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.919
Mummy let me talk to
him, let me talk to him.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.713
Let me ask him,
mummy please, mummy please.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.132
Mummy please let me just talk
to him, please mummy.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.092
-Listen!
-Please, mummy please.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.969
-Mummy please.
-He needs time.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.012
Give him time.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.847
How much time mummy, how much time?

07:52.930 --> 07:54.640
My life time.

07:57.602 --> 08:01.063
Mummy where will I go, where will I stay?

08:01.939 --> 08:04.066
For all the pain that you have caused me…

08:05.276 --> 08:11.032
that child that you're carrying
will cause you so much pain.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.244
So much more.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.277
You're not the only one I know

08:49.320 --> 08:51.781
I been trying to get it on my own

08:52.949 --> 08:55.284
I been digging way down low…

08:55.368 --> 08:56.702
Thank you.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.123
Cheers.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.124
Cheers.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.716
I got you something.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.093
You did?

09:12.176 --> 09:13.261
Mmm-hmm.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.222
Aww…

09:17.306 --> 09:18.474
What's in it?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.560
Okay Amanda, I'll give you a clue.

09:21.811 --> 09:25.856
It has something to do with
what I wanted us to talk about.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.567
Oh…

09:28.234 --> 09:30.486
The thing that you couldn't
discuss on the phone.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.445
Mmm-hmm.

09:34.991 --> 09:39.537
The thing is we have been
going out for about six months now.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.830
Right?

09:41.330 --> 09:46.377
And so I wanted us to
you know take this thing--

09:46.460 --> 09:47.545
Um…

09:48.296 --> 09:50.339
Can you give me a few minutes?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.843
I need to get to the
ladies… like I'll be right back.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.969
Is everything okay?

09:55.678 --> 09:56.846
Of course.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.055
Yeah.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.557
Okay.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.809
Yeah.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.773
Huh.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.359
Hello babes, what's up? What happened?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.404
Babe, there's a big problem.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.489
Please don't tell me he forgot
his wallet at home please.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.992
I think he's about to propose.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.161
Yes, he's about to propose

10:20.244 --> 10:22.413
Oh my God… yay

10:23.164 --> 10:25.374
Oh my God, are you serious?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.418
You should be grateful he's not
one of those nonsense guys.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.586
That will be acting as your boyfriend

10:28.669 --> 10:30.338
for months, no proposal, nothing

10:30.421 --> 10:31.380
At least he's about to propose…

10:31.464 --> 10:32.965
So how is that an issue?

10:33.591 --> 10:34.508
Nora.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.803
-Wait, you haven't told him about Nora?
-No.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.181
Babes it's Jide, the guy loves you.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.768
That's the same we thought about
George and Okopi and Rogers.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.103
Please! Please!! Please!!!

10:46.187 --> 10:48.022
We're talking about someone
that is quite sensible here.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.441
Not all those idiots that
heard you have a child

10:50.524 --> 10:52.777
and then decided to disappear
because of the fear of paying school fees.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.111
Uh-uh, no.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.865
Amanda, level with me.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.033
Are you not feeling the guy?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.160
You know that I am.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.954
It's the only reason why
I'm not letting him get…

11:05.623 --> 11:07.041
intimate with me.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.835
Are you joking? Six months babes.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.629
Ah-ah, what?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.923
You know you could possibly
have cobwebs down there right now.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.303
Just thank God that I'm not that guy
Or else I would have absconded by now.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.223
You should just donate
your thing to a convent.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.433
Well, am I thankful you're not him.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.937
On a serious not I think
you should just go out there

11:28.020 --> 11:29.271
and tell him about Nora.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.315
It's Jide, it's Jide he loves you.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.317
He's not going to do anything
about it, the guy loves you.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.069
Are you sure?

11:35.152 --> 11:36.862
Yes, I'm very sure.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.489
And when you get back
there just act surprised.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.657
don't do all these…

11:40.616 --> 11:41.492
Okay?

11:41.575 --> 11:43.911
I'll put wine inside the
fridge, we're going to celebrate tonight.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.997
And when you get back we're
going to talking about Aso-ebi stuff.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.375
-Colors, yellow, purple…
-Stop it.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.545
Let the proposal happen first
before you start planning my wedding.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.047
My baby is about to get taken!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.173
Whoop! Whoop!

11:56.841 --> 11:59.427
Whop! whop! I guess you should get going.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.054
Alright, bye. Love you.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.889
Love you too, bye.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.105
Don't do it.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.985
Look, I didn't mean that.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.280
Sorry I listened to your
phone conversation.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.116
Don't tell him about your daughter.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.326
It never ends well.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.580
Same thing happened to me years ago.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.166
No one wanted to marry
me because of my daughter.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.835
Past forty today,

12:33.335 --> 12:34.753
I'm here…

12:34.837 --> 12:37.465
Celebrating my fourth
year wedding anniversary.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.551
And till today…

12:42.136 --> 12:44.847
My husband thinks my daughter is my niece.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.063
I'm sure you're wondering
how I'm pulling it off.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.858
Well, the thing is we were married…

12:55.941 --> 12:59.111
I convinced him to send
her to school abroad.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.910
Well…

13:09.038 --> 13:11.290
Congrats on your soon to be engagement.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.556
Hmm…

13:27.640 --> 13:28.474
Hey.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.558
You're back.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.768
Yeah

13:38.400 --> 13:39.610
I um…

13:40.986 --> 13:41.904
I…

13:47.535 --> 13:49.453
You look like you have
something on your mind.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.872
Actually, yes.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.458
You do. Okay, let it out.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.337
So while I was back
there in the rest room…

13:58.420 --> 14:02.883
I was trying to figure out a way to…

14:04.260 --> 14:06.971
get you to tell me what's in the box.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.265
Because I hate surprises so…

14:09.348 --> 14:10.599
Aha…

14:12.184 --> 14:13.852
Okay, I'll tell you.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.814
So the thing is…

14:17.982 --> 14:19.859
I have… I…

14:19.942 --> 14:22.736
Go on. Look,
even if you've killed someone.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.113
Okay, did you kill anyone?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.824
Because even if you did, look…

14:27.366 --> 14:29.118
I'll help you hide the body.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.161
Okay, so out with it.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.582
I… have a medical condition.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.668
Oh wow.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.003
-Yeah.
-You do?

14:40.421 --> 14:43.007
Oh dear, I'm so sorry.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.092
How long have you been dealing with this?

14:45.175 --> 14:46.051
Bastard!

14:46.594 --> 14:48.137
You lying bastard.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.097
You're a stupid man.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.057
So this is the fellowship
you were going for?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.560
-Mabel just jus--
-Oh please keep quiet.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.145
I knew it.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.523
My instincts told me
that you had started again.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.860
But I said
"Mabel, come on, stay positive."

15:02.943 --> 15:04.862
"Your darling husband
has learnt his lesson."

15:04.945 --> 15:06.280
"He has changed."

15:06.363 --> 15:09.033
But then, I opened up your gift.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.243
And guess what I found.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.871
This…

15:14.371 --> 15:16.790
Does this look like your wife’s size?

15:16.874 --> 15:17.917
Does it?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.793
It's obviously not my s--

15:19.877 --> 15:21.629
Hey, aunty.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.088
Where do you think you're going?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.214
Take a seat.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.883
Don't make me descend on you.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.092
Hmm…

15:29.053 --> 15:31.972
Does this tiny thing…

15:32.056 --> 15:34.224
Does it look like what your wife wears?

15:34.308 --> 15:37.311
Is this my size? I said you should not…

15:41.774 --> 15:42.650
It is you.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.361
It's obviously yours.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.904
Husband snatcher.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.699
Husband snatcher. Cheap prostitute. Woo!

15:50.783 --> 15:53.202
Let me see what he got for you.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.830
Shameless thing, you want
to snatch my husband right?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.415
Hmm… I said it.

15:58.916 --> 15:59.750
You see…

16:00.417 --> 16:02.211
God's gift.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.381
Purely natural, not surgery, not Lekki.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.675
Did you think this would be her size?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.511
You thought this would be her size right?

16:10.594 --> 16:11.887
-Take a look at your tomato breasts.
-Okay--

16:11.971 --> 16:13.764
-Does this look like your size?
-Okay Mabel…

16:13.847 --> 16:14.848
You're embarrassing us.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.392
Will you shut up there?

16:16.475 --> 16:17.601
Embarrassing what?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.186
Look, the world must hear.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.421
You took a part of my soul

16:45.504 --> 16:50.217
But I'd still give you more babe

16:56.306 --> 16:57.766
All men are scum.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.309
All of them.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.728
I tried…

17:02.980 --> 17:04.481
I really tried.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.777
I checked his online profile.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.780
There was no clue that he was married.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.198
Like, I'm done.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.034
I'm done with all of them.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.036
I'm done with all men.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.331
Is that him? Give me the phone.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.543
Let me curse his life and his
generation. Give me the phone.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.670
-It's not him.
-Amanda.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.963
Amanda.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.673
Seriously it's some…

17:30.507 --> 17:32.801
Some guy who is obsessed with my blog and

17:32.885 --> 17:34.178
he keeps blowing up the comment section--

17:34.261 --> 17:36.388
Give me the phone.
I know you're very cool.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.681
But I'll make sure to deal with him.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.517
I'm going to help you find this closure,
by the time I insult his generation…

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
I insult everyone in his life…

17:45.481 --> 17:47.024
Michael007.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.777
What's up?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.070
What's this one's gist?

17:51.570 --> 17:52.613
Like I said…

17:53.197 --> 17:55.991
He's some guy who is
obsessed with my blog and

17:56.075 --> 17:58.744
he's just… always in the comment section.

17:58.827 --> 17:59.745
Sorry.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.042
Hey baby.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.960
Hi.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.170
Oh, you're downstairs?

18:08.712 --> 18:09.546
Um…

18:11.131 --> 18:12.966
Okay er… give me like a minute.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.344
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a minute.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.555
I love you too

18:19.640 --> 18:20.682
Okay.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.398
Um… that was Biola.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.733
He…

18:29.817 --> 18:30.984
It's fine, you can go.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.820
Honestly I would have
loved to stay with you.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.947
Really, I want to stay with you.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.407
But you know, I've just been postponing
this date for about a month now.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.660
-And it's not just--
-I'll be okay, really.

18:39.743 --> 18:40.786
Are you sure?

18:40.869 --> 18:42.704
So what are you going to do when I'm gone?

18:43.413 --> 18:45.124
Yes, that's what's up!

18:45.207 --> 18:47.000
Bad bitch!

18:47.501 --> 18:48.961
That's what I'm talking about

18:49.044 --> 18:52.089
Just make sure you
don't over indulge because

18:52.172 --> 18:54.758
we don't want Nora
waking up to a drunk mother.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.844
I promise.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.931
Have fun.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.266
I will, trust me I will.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.350
Wait…

19:04.226 --> 19:05.561
This Michael guy…

19:05.644 --> 19:07.646
Don't you think he can…

19:07.729 --> 19:08.564
Kemi no.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.982
-Let me just finish what I'm saying.
-Don't!

19:10.065 --> 19:13.193
I'm actually just saying that
you can just chat up with him.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.154
Just flirt… just flirt. Ah-ah.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.573
What? Are you going to kill
yourself because of a man?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.783
Is that what you want to do? You want to
kill yourself because of a man?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.244
Look, flirt with him. You and I
know that nothing will come out of it.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.662
So just have fun.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.998
Just have fun.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.041
I have to start going now.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.752
-Go on dear.
-Just take care of yourself alright.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.004
-Okay
-Have fun.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.422
I will.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.509
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.636
Kemi go please. I'll be fine.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.972
Okay, I'll be back in
an hour. I promise you okay.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.140
Love you, bye.

19:55.068 --> 19:59.948
They never showed me
How to even open my arms

20:00.908 --> 20:04.536
I've been dreaming that I'm flying

20:05.871 --> 20:11.793
I've seen the city through
The clouds, it's oh so small

20:11.877 --> 20:15.839
Every now and then I'm falling

20:18.175 --> 20:20.260
Say something

20:20.844 --> 20:23.347
Say something

20:24.181 --> 20:29.061
Blood rushing to ease the pain

20:29.811 --> 20:32.022
Say something

20:32.522 --> 20:34.441
Don't leave me hanging

20:35.567 --> 20:39.863
Say something, don't leave again

20:41.573 --> 20:46.328
Say something, say something

20:47.579 --> 20:52.209
Blood rushing to ease the pain

20:53.001 --> 20:56.672
Say something,
don't leave me hanging--

21:02.886 --> 21:04.221
‎Nora!

21:06.890 --> 21:07.933
Nora.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.185
Nora.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.271
Mummy.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.189
Shut down that laptop, give me the phone.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.357
Mummy please.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.735
We agreed on the rules and we
also agreed on the consequences.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.070
Now give me the phone.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.364
Mummy please I got carried away.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.825
-I didn't know it was already--
-Shut down that laptop.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.588
Why would you, why would you

21:38.672 --> 21:41.133
Why would you say bye-bye

21:41.216 --> 21:42.801
Why would you, why would you

21:42.884 --> 21:44.761
Why would you say bye-bye

21:44.845 --> 21:47.306
I saw you the other day on road

21:48.223 --> 21:50.309
Rocking them new clothes

21:50.392 --> 21:52.144
Whipping that new ride

21:52.227 --> 21:54.187
I was liking the whole vibe

21:54.271 --> 21:56.523
Tonight, tonight

21:56.606 --> 21:58.400

22:30.807 --> 22:32.601

What?

23:36.873 --> 23:38.083
Nothing.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
No phone for you for the next two weeks.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.186
-But mummy…
-Now sleep

23:58.270 --> 24:00.897
before I hold your phone
until your next birthday.

I been digging way down low

Wait… are you still
chatting with him since

25:22.229 --> 25:23.438
-last night?
-No.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.566
Whatever happened to
"Uh… you know it's just one night".

25:26.650 --> 25:29.194
"Just for tonight, I'm just
using him to amuse myself"

25:29.277 --> 25:30.820
I'm just going to take my time…

25:30.904 --> 25:34.074
No, I'm just responding to his
comments on my blog that's all.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.784
-Really?
-That's all.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.160
I promise.

25:37.744 --> 25:38.995
Okay.

Hmm…

25:48.672 --> 25:49.756
Are you okay?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.217
I mean with what happened
last night, you're literally

25:52.300 --> 25:54.386
just carrying on like nothing happened.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.681
Life goes on kemi.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.935
Yes, I know life goes on
but are you really okay?

26:02.018 --> 26:04.437
I'm fine, really.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.563
Alright, so where is Nor--

26:05.647 --> 26:07.107
Okay, here she comes.

Morning mummy, morning aunty Kemi.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.946
Morning darling.

Good morning.

Good morning mummy.

Better.

what happened yesterday.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.165
Uh uh…

26:24.666 --> 26:26.001
Are you really?

26:30.547 --> 26:31.464
Okay.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.597
Do we have an agreement

26:39.681 --> 26:41.725
about not staying on the phone till late?

26:44.394 --> 26:45.353
Here you go.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.354
Thank you mummy.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.774
Now, go and wait for aunty Kemi in her car

26:49.858 --> 26:51.693
-she's dropping you off today.
-Okay, let's go.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.404
But mummy you said we were going
to talk about my transfer in the morning.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.990
What's there to talk about again darling.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.950
You're going to boarding
school and that's it.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.411
-But mummy…
-I don't have time for this, this morning

27:01.494 --> 27:02.954
Okay, I'm running late.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.206
But Mr. Mike, my counselor in school--

27:05.290 --> 27:08.001
I don't care what Mr. Mike says Nora.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.794
I'm your parent.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.547
You're going to boarding
school and that's it.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.133
Now go and wait for aunty Kemi in her car.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.181
What?

27:30.065 --> 27:30.982
I'm done.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.193
I'm just done!

27:33.276 --> 27:35.403
Can you imagine he's not
been replying my text messages

27:35.487 --> 27:38.239
just because I said "Oh I'm not
going to spend the night at your place"

27:38.323 --> 27:39.657
He's just so selfish.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.242
And the last time I spent
the night at his place…

27:41.326 --> 27:42.202
He didn't let me sleep.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.996
He was just tossing me all over the place.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.873
The kind of waist
pain I experienced for a week

27:46.956 --> 27:48.333
I couldn't feel my legs--

27:51.127 --> 27:52.337
You're laughing.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.215
No, no, no, not at you.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.092
Somebody sent something
to my phone and just--

27:57.175 --> 27:59.886
Amanda I left my department just
to come and pour out my heart to you

27:59.969 --> 28:01.262
-and then you're laughing at me.
-Please I'm sorry.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.181
You can't even keep
your eyes of Michael's text.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.059
Who said it was Michael?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.435
-Really it's not--
-Yes, it is not--

28:07.519 --> 28:09.104
Give me the phone, give me the phone.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.566
Sorry.

28:16.694 --> 28:17.987
Give me my phone please.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.781
Idiot.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.117
Keep deceiving yourself,
like you and I don't know

28:22.200 --> 28:23.618
you've fallen in love with the guy.

28:23.701 --> 28:24.994
-Fallen in love?
-Oh yes.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.121
A fat chance.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.289
Babe, my heart is locked away in a safe

28:28.373 --> 28:29.999
-and I've thrown away the keys.
-Oh really?

28:30.083 --> 28:33.294
This that I'm doing right
here is called "catching cruise".

28:33.378 --> 28:34.546
-Hmm…
-Yes.

28:34.629 --> 28:37.173
Nonsense, nonsense.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.176
Who is there?

28:40.260 --> 28:41.469
-Come in!
-Are you expecting someone?

28:44.889 --> 28:46.599
Hey, um…this came in for you.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.059
Oh.

28:48.601 --> 28:49.894
Okay, thank you.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.027
Your favorite food. Wait, from who?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.196
Aww…

29:00.280 --> 29:02.407
-Our new boyfriend.
-He's not my boyfriend.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.242
Eh… he knows your favorite food.

29:04.325 --> 29:07.120
He knows your favorite restaurant
and he's not your boyfriend.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.621
Yeah right.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.081
Please say something else.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.083
But wait a minute.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.378
I thought white guys liked
to send flowers and stuff.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.088
Is that him?

29:17.172 --> 29:18.006
-Kemi--
-Wait, wait, wait…

29:18.089 --> 29:19.883
Kemi why are you like this?
please give me my phone.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.050
Hi Michael.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.594
This is Kemi.

29:22.677 --> 29:23.845
Amanda's best friend,

29:23.928 --> 29:25.388
-so we got the food you sent.
-Kemi stop it, Kemi stop.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.850
And Amanda absolutely
loves it, thank you so much.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.602
By the way Michael I thought white guys

29:30.685 --> 29:33.188
-like to send flowers and all that stuff.
-Kemi, give me my phone.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.815
-What gives?
-Don't send it, don't!

29:37.150 --> 29:38.485
Why are you like this?

29:38.568 --> 29:39.986
I'm sorry, too late.

29:40.528 --> 29:43.031
Hold on, why are you upset?
I thought it was all fun and games.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.241
So? Is that why you
have to send him stuff?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.285
Okay, he just replied.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.871
How come he's awake by this time, wait…

29:51.080 --> 29:53.416
Hello Kemi, hi Amanda

29:54.125 --> 29:55.376
Very funny Kemi

29:56.169 --> 29:58.630
Why would I send flowers?
Is that what she'll eat?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.843
Wait, he sent another one.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.388
How's my pidgin?

30:07.472 --> 30:10.433
I've been watching Nigerian movies
like you suggested and in one of them,

30:10.517 --> 30:12.393
I learned that
sending flowers is a no ,no.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.816
I swear this guy is smart.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.902
He has done his thorough research.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.073
Okay, now that lunch is here…

30:29.994 --> 30:31.204
-Mummy
-Yes.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.498
You said you're traveling again.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.625
Yeah, uh… it's a work trip

30:35.708 --> 30:38.127
but don't worry I won't be gone for long.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.589
And aunty Kemi is
going to be here with you.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.467
And both of you can
get up to all the mischief

30:44.551 --> 30:46.511
you get up to when mummy is not around.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.557
But why can't your office
people send someone else?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.350
Does it always have to be you?

30:54.310 --> 30:55.687
Okay…

30:59.607 --> 31:00.859
Your phone…

31:01.359 --> 31:02.694
when did I get it?

31:03.945 --> 31:05.572
The last time you travelled.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.575
So let's just assume

31:09.325 --> 31:12.036
that they send someone else for this trip,

31:13.329 --> 31:16.708
where would I get the travel
bonus that I use to buy your phone…

31:16.791 --> 31:18.543
and all the nice things I buy for you.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.712
And even pay your school fees?

31:21.963 --> 31:22.922
Good.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.138
I think…

31:30.847 --> 31:32.724
we're all done.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.309
Look at it.

31:34.809 --> 31:35.977
Do you like it?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.330
-Mummy.
-Yes.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.414
Who is Michael?

31:56.497 --> 31:57.540
What?

31:58.249 --> 31:59.500
What Michael?

31:59.584 --> 32:03.254
Aunty Kemi always talks to me
about a Michael that is your friend.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.716
Oh, that Michael

32:06.799 --> 32:09.218
My colleague, our colleague…

32:10.178 --> 32:11.638
at work… colleague.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.056
What?

32:13.556 --> 32:14.641
Can't I cough again?

32:15.266 --> 32:19.145
You know… my counselor
in school his name is Michael.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.355
Mr. Mike.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.606
-He's really--
-Okay.

32:21.689 --> 32:22.690
Hold it.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.486
If this about talking
to Mr. Mike about going

32:26.569 --> 32:28.863
to boarding school,
it's not going to happen.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.031
So drop it.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.544
Baby.

32:46.756 --> 32:50.218
I know that you're not crazy
about going to boarding school.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.011
But you have to trust…

32:52.553 --> 32:54.889
that I'm making the best decision for you.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.016
For us.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.353
Are you ashamed of me?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.313
Chimnoram.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.565
Why would you think that?

33:06.025 --> 33:08.695
How could I ever be ashamed of you baby?

33:08.778 --> 33:10.488
Please don't send me away.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.115
I promise to be good.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.743
Baby, I'm not…

33:15.827 --> 33:16.953
Amanda.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.373
What?

33:25.878 --> 33:28.756
Um… baby let's talk about this later okay.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.299
Alright.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.739
How did you find my place?

33:55.324 --> 33:57.035
Sorry I showed up like this.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.870
You weren't responding to my messages.

33:58.953 --> 34:01.831
-I've been trying to reach--
-Muna, what do you want?

34:05.668 --> 34:08.046
I just wanted to see you and…

34:08.129 --> 34:09.881
check on you and see how things are.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.716
And now that you've done that…

34:12.216 --> 34:13.051
Goodbye.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.678
Amanda please.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.805
Please wait.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.140
Please.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.936
I get that you don't want to see us,

34:24.020 --> 34:26.147
or hear from any of us.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.567
But Amanda please.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.486
We are trying.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.781
Please…

34:38.534 --> 34:40.870
I'm sorry for the part I played.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.289
I was young and stupid.

34:44.123 --> 34:47.335
But really I reacted how
any other teenage girl will act

34:47.418 --> 34:50.171
when her sister gets
pregnant for her boyfriend.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.934
You can't blame me Amanda.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.730
You guys disowned me.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.609
Kicked me out onto the streets.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.530
But you know what?

35:16.072 --> 35:17.156
It's fine.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.574
Because I'm over it.

35:18.658 --> 35:23.746
Please tell me what we
can do to make things right.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.498
Make things right.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.625
You know what?

35:28.626 --> 35:29.919
You, tell me…

35:30.461 --> 35:34.048
what grand plans you guys have

35:34.757 --> 35:37.343
to somehow erase

35:38.553 --> 35:39.595
the pain.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.722
Father please, please…

35:42.390 --> 35:43.516
The horror.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.727
The torture.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.063
No, no…

35:49.147 --> 35:50.481
That I went through,

35:50.982 --> 35:52.775
homeless on the streets,

35:53.484 --> 35:55.194
with a baby to fend for.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.030
Amanda, I can't imagine--

35:58.114 --> 35:59.699
No you can't!

35:59.782 --> 36:02.869
Because if you could, you
would not be here asking me.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.955
How to make things right.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.044
Muna.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.547
Stay away from me.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.967
Stay away from me.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.011
Just…

36:20.803 --> 36:21.721
Give me time.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.681
Okay, fine.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.601
Fine.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.312
How much time?

36:35.818 --> 36:37.486
My life time.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.840
I know I shouldn't have done that.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.051
I just thought it was high
time you forgave them.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.470
-That was not your place.
-I know.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.306
I told you everything I
went through with them.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.683
And you can't continue
to live your life like this.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.769
At some point bitterness will kill you.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.437
It doesn't make sense.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.337
This is why she came.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.215
This is what she came to show me,

37:39.298 --> 37:42.009
to rub in my face that
she's getting married!

38:10.746 --> 38:14.208
You tell me that you're sorry

38:14.292 --> 38:17.545
Will make up tomorrow

38:17.628 --> 38:23.801
Tell me everything
You know I wanna hear

38:24.552 --> 38:26.971
I'm trying to be open…

38:27.054 --> 38:28.264
Nora.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.690
Nora.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.042
Nora.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.467
I know you're not sleeping.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.476
I'm leaving for the airport now.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.400
Won't you say goodbye?

39:26.155 --> 39:27.156
Bye.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.188
I'll call you.

40:30.678 --> 40:35.891
And either way I need to make it clear

40:37.017 --> 40:39.812
Before we're leaving here

41:04.420 --> 41:05.713
Delivery is in the back.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.803
Excuse me, would you like
coffee or tea while you wait?

41:12.887 --> 41:14.972
No, thank you I'm fine.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.352
Uh uh…

41:20.436 --> 41:21.479
Okay, right away.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.689
You can head in now.

41:23.772 --> 41:26.609
Oh, thank you very much.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.830
-Good morning miss Abraham.
-Good morning.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.957
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Not a problem.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.334
Please call me Amanda.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.543
-Cool.
-Thank you.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.921
-Have a seat Amanda.
-Thank you, nice to meet you.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.714
I'm surprised that you stopped over here.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.800
Most travel agents representing their
companies are at the convention by now.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.427
Um… yes.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.096
I wanted to meet with you in person

41:56.180 --> 41:58.682
before meeting at the convention.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.186
So my organization
believes strongly that we can

42:02.269 --> 42:04.897
do business that's
mutually beneficial to us both.

42:05.481 --> 42:07.650
We saw the proposal
you sent in and responded.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.235
We're in.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.362
We sent the mail to
your office this morning.

42:11.445 --> 42:12.321
You must have been on the flight.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.656
Yes I was.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.157
Wow, that's great.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.493
Please don't tell me that's
why you came over to the states.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.080
Securing this deal is
very important to us but

42:21.163 --> 42:22.790
also attending the convention is a

42:22.873 --> 42:24.750
very important annual commitment for us.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.460
Awesome, I feel better.

42:27.461 --> 42:30.089
So if you'll excuse me I must
get to the convention now.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.924
Absolutely.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.718
Um… thank you so much for
meeting me on short notice.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.637
-The pleasure is all mine.
-Thank you.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.222
May I give you a ride to the venue?

42:38.305 --> 42:39.807
-Oh yeah.
-I assume you're not driving.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.560
Thank you, that's so
kind of you. Absolutely.

42:42.643 --> 42:43.602
Thank you.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.855
Yeah, I'll keep that.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.365
My dear…

42:56.448 --> 42:59.660
I was getting ready to give
the master of all presentations.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.161
Then he tells me they've agreed.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.413
Can you beat that?

43:03.956 --> 43:05.416
I'm telling you!

43:07.835 --> 43:09.503
Babe hold on there's a call coming in.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.422
I'll call you right back. Alright cool.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.553
Hello.

43:21.974 --> 43:23.350
Hello, who is there?

43:23.434 --> 43:24.852
Chimamanda.

43:27.396 --> 43:28.314
It's me.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.817
Me is not a name.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.737
Chimamanda you know it's me your mother.

43:36.238 --> 43:37.406
Please…

43:37.906 --> 43:39.491
Please don't end the call again.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.368
Chimamanda

43:42.911 --> 43:43.996
We need to talk.

43:44.079 --> 43:45.623
No, we're not doing this.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.333
Chimamanda I'm sorry.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.921
I'm so sorry.

43:53.005 --> 43:53.881
No.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.218
I've made my peace with
your silence and the past.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.471
Let it stay that way.

45:20.342 --> 45:23.220
You know you're my wish ma

45:50.539 --> 45:56.378
You give me love
wey sweet pass pami oh

45:59.256 --> 46:00.883
So how's Nora?

46:00.966 --> 46:03.051
I've been calling her and
she's not been picking up.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.305
Um…she's fine.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.099
Is she awake? Can I talk to her?

46:15.147 --> 46:18.317
Um… she's asleep.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.736
She's awake isn't she?

46:32.831 --> 46:34.082
Okay.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.544
So like her mother, she
knows how to hold grudges.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.672
You know what, give her some
time she'll come around okay.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.925
Now, what's up.

46:43.008 --> 46:44.801
How's our lover boy, have you guys met?

46:45.761 --> 46:46.887
Not yet.

46:47.387 --> 46:50.182
But I'm right now
on my way to surprise him.

46:50.265 --> 46:52.100
Hey, Amanda, Amanda…

46:53.060 --> 46:55.771
You're still insistent on
this surprise visit thing.

46:55.854 --> 46:59.566
And you're so vehemently
against it because?

46:59.650 --> 47:01.360
Okay, so listen to me.

47:01.443 --> 47:03.695
I don't have a problem
with it, but imagine if

47:03.779 --> 47:06.907
out of the blues this guy
just shows up at our doorstep.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.785
And at that particular point in
time you don’t have make up on.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.287
Don't get me wrong
it's not like there'll be

47:12.371 --> 47:13.830
a disaster or anything.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.958
But then you’d love
to be at your best when

47:16.041 --> 47:17.751
you're meeting him for the first time so…

47:17.834 --> 47:20.254
Look, I just want to meet the real him.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.005
Right? Without any pretenses.

47:22.089 --> 47:24.716
Okay. Well, I've said my piece.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.885
This one that you're so
serious about meeting--

47:26.969 --> 47:28.512
like… I don't get it.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.305
Anyway…

47:31.223 --> 47:35.102
I honestly hope this guy is
as he looks on social media.

47:35.185 --> 47:38.355
I hope he doesn't turn
out to be an eighty plus year old man.

47:40.607 --> 47:43.569
I've had so many video calls
with him Kemi and you know this.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.153
Where is all this coming from?

47:45.237 --> 47:47.906
I don't know I'm just anxious for you.

47:47.990 --> 47:49.700
I don't know…

47:50.242 --> 47:52.995
Amanda honestly I really
want this to work.

48:07.884 --> 48:09.094
Alright.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.597
Thank you so much.

49:21.416 --> 49:24.628
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa… slow your roll.

49:25.629 --> 49:28.340
You have to take me to
dinner before we get to the kinky stuff.

49:29.174 --> 49:30.676
I'll send you a picture.

49:51.405 --> 49:52.280
Hmm…

49:53.699 --> 49:55.033
Thank you.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.952
Oh my God, it's so good to see you.

50:03.542 --> 50:04.584
I’m so sorry.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.336
-Oh my goodness.
-I'm so sorry.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.714
-I'm sorry.
-Jesus.

50:09.297 --> 50:10.257
Clumsy.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.467
I'm sorry.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.594
-I'll pay for that.
-No, it's okay ma'am

50:14.678 --> 50:15.637
Amanda?

50:18.890 --> 50:20.183
Amanda?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.852
I can't believe you're here.

50:23.603 --> 50:26.189
Oh my God and you even
look more beautiful in person.

50:27.691 --> 50:28.608
You got me.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.236
Wait, Natasha.

50:31.319 --> 50:33.071
Natasha, it's Amanda.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.364
She's here.

50:37.909 --> 50:40.787
Oh my God. It's nice to finally meet you.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.831
He won't stop talking about you.

50:45.250 --> 50:46.835
Natasha is my cousin.

50:49.212 --> 50:50.380
Um…

50:51.047 --> 50:52.257
Nice to meet you Natasha.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.551
Oh, trust me, the pleasure is all mine.

50:54.634 --> 50:57.763
Um… I really hate to do this
but I have to get going.

50:57.846 --> 51:00.432
I was just stopping in to say hi um…

51:00.974 --> 51:03.268
I hope to see you again, some time soon.

51:03.351 --> 51:04.186
Me too.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.395
Um…

51:05.479 --> 51:08.356
Well I'll let you two lovebirds catch up

51:08.440 --> 51:11.568
-But you still owe me lunch sometime okay.
-Fine, fine…

51:16.364 --> 51:17.324
You're in New York.

51:17.407 --> 51:18.325
Yes.

51:19.242 --> 51:20.952
What are you doing in New York?

51:21.870 --> 51:23.622
I got you this.

51:25.999 --> 51:27.501
Thank you. Come on, come and sit down.

51:27.584 --> 51:28.710
Thank you.

51:28.794 --> 51:30.253
Oh my gosh…

51:33.173 --> 51:35.008
I still can't believe you're here.

51:38.553 --> 51:40.055
So have you been out in the city yet?

51:40.138 --> 51:41.932
I have to take you around.

51:42.015 --> 51:43.266
Not yet.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.310
I've been very busy with
the convention I'm here for.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.978
Oh, workaholic.

51:47.062 --> 51:47.979
That's me.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.983
Well, weekdays are
the best time for a tour.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.902
It's when you get to
see the energy of the city.

51:53.985 --> 51:56.071
Now here goes the bill sir.

52:00.033 --> 52:01.201
Do you want to split this?

52:02.744 --> 52:03.829
What?

52:06.706 --> 52:07.666
Forget I asked.

52:10.126 --> 52:12.087
You know what, I'll get it.

52:16.883 --> 52:17.968
Here you go.

52:18.051 --> 52:18.885
Okay.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.346
I'll be right back.

52:23.181 --> 52:24.724
I'm sorry I--

52:25.851 --> 52:27.561
I just want to be a good
feminist you know…

52:27.644 --> 52:29.646
I never know what you all want.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.569
Alright.

52:38.905 --> 52:39.865
Okay, y'all set.

52:39.948 --> 52:41.366
Here you go ma'am.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.159
-Thank you very much
-Here you go sir.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.202
Thanks.

52:46.079 --> 52:47.455
Uh, maybe we should have some wine?

52:48.123 --> 52:49.583
I'll pass thank you.

53:04.639 --> 53:07.517
Look, I'm just going to address
the elephant in the room.

53:08.226 --> 53:11.271
-About asking to split the bill--
-Michael it's fine really.

53:11.771 --> 53:13.315
It's cool.

53:21.948 --> 53:23.325
It's twenty one, fifty.

53:23.825 --> 53:24.659
Okay.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.661
Hey, hey… don't worry about it.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.622
I got it thank you.

53:36.838 --> 53:37.964
Okay then.

53:38.965 --> 53:40.175
Are you free tonight?

53:40.258 --> 53:41.593
We could go out for dinner.

53:41.676 --> 53:45.138
Um… I don't think so.
I have reports to turn in.

53:46.056 --> 53:46.890
Okay, bye.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.433
Oh, here I'll walk you in.

53:48.516 --> 53:50.685
I will be fine thank you.

53:50.769 --> 53:51.728
Thanks for offering.

53:52.228 --> 53:53.772
-Bye.
-Alright.

54:01.404 --> 54:02.614
Hey, Amanda

54:03.573 --> 54:04.407
Amanda.

54:08.244 --> 54:09.412
Look…

54:10.080 --> 54:12.082
I know that today should
have gone a lot better.

54:12.165 --> 54:14.334
-Look it's fine.
-No, no, no it's not.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.379
I got nervous.

54:17.462 --> 54:18.922
I got in my own way.

54:20.215 --> 54:22.634
But can we just try a fresh start?

54:23.134 --> 54:24.344
Can we hang out tomorrow?

54:25.261 --> 54:27.764
Please?
I want to take you around the city.

54:27.847 --> 54:30.976
I'll pick you up in the
morning and it'll be great.

54:31.685 --> 54:32.560
Please.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.272
‎I'll text you later.

54:54.290 --> 54:57.544
And that's how I turned
and bumped into the waiter.

54:57.627 --> 54:59.963
Everything he was carrying
spilled onto the ground.

55:00.046 --> 55:01.131
Jesus!

55:01.214 --> 55:05.176
I felt like the ground should
open and just swallow me. I swear.

55:05.260 --> 55:09.180
Babe, now you see why I don't do surprises

55:09.264 --> 55:11.558
See, If I was a bad friend
this would have been my

55:11.641 --> 55:13.018
I told you so moment.

55:13.101 --> 55:15.520
Shut up, useless person.

55:16.521 --> 55:18.273
Anyway, to cut the long story short

55:18.356 --> 55:20.066
Eh… no, no…

55:20.150 --> 55:21.985
Don't cut any long story short.

55:22.068 --> 55:24.362
Don't cut it. Give me
the full gist in details.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.906
As a matter of fact,
give me the back story.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.366
I'm listening, spill.

55:29.826 --> 55:31.327
Don't you don't have to work tomorrow?

55:31.411 --> 55:32.620
What work?

55:33.121 --> 55:35.665
Please. Ultimately, I'll call in late.

55:35.749 --> 55:38.752
I still have a movie I want
to see after this conversation.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.045
I've been saving it for a while.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.129
Go ahead and spill.

55:41.212 --> 55:42.756
I'm listening to you.

55:43.423 --> 55:46.885
Anyway, he wants to meet up tomorrow.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.636
Um…

55:49.179 --> 55:51.222
I reluctantly agreed though but…

55:51.306 --> 55:53.141
Please, please… I think I'll pass.

55:53.224 --> 55:54.392
Babes I’m on this one with you,

55:54.476 --> 55:56.352
just run and don't look back.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.980
Run away. Run away.

55:59.522 --> 56:02.358
Hi miss Amanda, you have
a delivery from Mr. Michael.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.694
Hello?

56:10.617 --> 56:12.702
Hello, are you there?

56:14.954 --> 56:16.831
Hello babes, what's happening?

56:16.915 --> 56:18.875
Babe, you won't believe this.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.884
Kemi you need to see this

56:27.967 --> 56:28.885
See what?

56:38.853 --> 56:40.647
Wait, wait, wait… from Michael?

56:44.192 --> 56:46.820
This is exactly what I'm talking
about. Oh my God, oh my God.

56:46.903 --> 56:48.071
This is so good.

56:49.155 --> 56:51.908
Listen up. Tomorrow,
if you know what's good for you…

56:51.991 --> 56:56.037
…you better go for that
date or else I'll kill you myself.

56:56.913 --> 57:00.625
Babe, if you don't go just unfriend
me and never return to this house.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.087
This is so beautiful.

57:04.170 --> 57:05.171
Wow.

57:13.805 --> 57:15.098
So what do you think?

57:15.849 --> 57:17.100
-Uh-uh…
-What?

57:17.183 --> 57:18.017
Too tight?

57:18.101 --> 57:19.853
There are some small issues.

57:19.936 --> 57:21.271
Babe, it's too decent.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.398
Don't you have
something that shows some skin?

57:23.481 --> 57:24.732
You're not serious.

57:24.816 --> 57:26.151
No, no, no… I'm serious.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.569
I'm serious. Look,

57:27.652 --> 57:29.946
after all the serenading
this guy gave you yesterday…

57:30.029 --> 57:31.906
babe you have to update.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.076
You have to upgrade, give him stuff…

57:35.160 --> 57:36.870
I wonder why I ever tell you anything.

57:36.953 --> 57:39.414
Amanda. Okay, look at it this way.

57:39.914 --> 57:42.250
As it is right now this guy has already

57:42.333 --> 57:44.169
seen the wife material side of you.

57:44.669 --> 57:48.673
It's high time you show
him the other side of you.

57:48.756 --> 57:51.092
You know, the side that says uh…

57:51.676 --> 57:53.595
I'm a sexy goddess.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.054
I'm going to blow your brains

57:55.138 --> 57:57.182
Like give it to him, make him insane.

57:57.265 --> 57:58.933
Okay, I've heard.

57:59.017 --> 57:59.934
I have to go now he should be

58:00.018 --> 58:01.394

-No, no, no…

58:01.478 --> 58:03.188
babe don't go out like this please…

58:03.271 --> 58:04.689
Don't sabotage us please…

58:04.772 --> 58:06.191
Please, what is wrong with you?

58:06.274 --> 58:07.567
Stop embarrassing us.

58:07.650 --> 58:10.737
Thanks for your vote of confidence.
You've been really helpful.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.238
Amanda wait, wait,

58:12.322 --> 58:13.573
wait.

58:14.324 --> 58:15.241
Wait.

58:15.742 --> 58:19.579
Babe. So, he's taking you
on a date in the morning, on a weekday.

58:19.662 --> 58:20.997
Doesn't he have a job?

58:22.665 --> 58:24.709
I actually asked him yesterday.

58:24.792 --> 58:26.044
He says he's taking the week off

58:26.127 --> 58:27.670
Aww…

58:30.131 --> 58:32.383
Loving things.

58:32.467 --> 58:34.052
Sweet love.

58:34.135 --> 58:35.303
Bye.

58:45.313 --> 58:47.857
Yeah, I wave goodbye

58:49.234 --> 58:51.236
To my old life

58:51.319 --> 58:54.280
Been reaching for some new heights

58:54.364 --> 58:57.200
My baby there the whole time

58:57.283 --> 58:59.744
And it feels right

59:00.245 --> 59:02.455
You by my side

59:02.539 --> 59:05.208
A modern Bonnie and Clyde…

59:05.959 --> 59:06.834
Hey.

59:06.918 --> 59:07.919
Hey.

59:09.420 --> 59:10.547
I um…

59:11.047 --> 59:13.633
I really loved
the surprise from last night.

59:14.300 --> 59:15.468
Thank you.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.012
I'm glad to hear it again.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.265
And you said it a couple of times.

59:20.348 --> 59:22.141
Don't stop on my account.

59:23.685 --> 59:24.519
Ready to go?

59:24.602 --> 59:25.478
Yeah, sure…

59:25.562 --> 59:26.563
Alright.

59:28.982 --> 59:31.025
Guys, welcome to MA tours.

59:31.109 --> 59:33.486
I'm Frank and I'll be
your tour guide for this trip.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.696
Nice to meet you Frank.

59:34.779 --> 59:35.655
Michael.

59:35.738 --> 59:37.031
Yep, nice to meet you.

59:37.115 --> 59:38.491
-And Amanda.
-Amanda

59:38.575 --> 59:39.867
-Alright.
-Thank you.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.911
Do you guys want to
hop on in we'll get started.

59:41.995 --> 59:42.954
Oh…

59:44.414 --> 59:45.707
Sorry, let me get out.

59:45.790 --> 59:47.292
We've got a big group today.

59:49.627 --> 59:50.920
Watch your head.

59:55.216 --> 59:56.050
Alright.

59:58.219 --> 59:59.345
Wait…

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:01.848
Liz, you've just made it.

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:02.807
I know

1:00:02.890 --> 1:00:03.975
Thanks for waiting.

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:05.226
Hey… oh…

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:06.686
Excuse me…

1:00:07.604 --> 1:00:08.521
Will just squeeze in.

1:00:08.605 --> 1:00:09.647
Alright

1:00:10.732 --> 1:00:12.233
Hey. Whoa, just made it.

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:14.027
Hi, I'm Liz.

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:16.112
-Hi, I'm Amanda.
-Hi.

1:00:16.195 --> 1:00:18.031
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:20.575
Hi I'm Liz.

1:00:20.658 --> 1:00:21.743
Nice to meet you.

1:00:21.826 --> 1:00:23.244
Michael.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:24.537
Michael,

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:29.292
Amanda, Liz meet Larry and Isabella.

1:00:29.375 --> 1:00:31.002
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1:00:31.085 --> 1:00:33.129
-Hey, won't you wake up?
-Nice to meet you.

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:35.882
I told you we could
sleep in you insisted on this.

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:39.927
I'm up, I'm up… I just needed a
power nap before the real fun begins.

1:00:41.512 --> 1:00:42.472
So funny thing…

1:00:42.972 --> 1:00:45.141
…was telling Amanda
since I'm from New York…

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:47.602
-I'll be her personal tour guide.
-Hmm…

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:49.771
But I wouldn't want to speak over you.

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:51.272
Oh, I understand.

1:00:52.148 --> 1:00:54.859
I'm also from around here,
I love going on these tours.

1:00:54.942 --> 1:00:56.611
I really love meeting new people.

1:00:58.196 --> 1:00:59.405
Today is your lucky day.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:01.741
you're going to get three
tour guides for the price of one.

1:01:07.038 --> 1:01:07.997
Shall we?

1:01:08.081 --> 1:01:09.999
We can take this ride

1:01:10.083 --> 1:01:12.960
Wherever it goes

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:16.089
As long as you're with me

1:01:16.172 --> 1:01:17.924
I feel at home

1:01:18.007 --> 1:01:20.051
Alright, so if you guys
can see right up here…

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:22.720
on the right with a big spire is…

1:01:22.804 --> 1:01:24.806
-Oh, it's the empire state building.
-The empire state building.

1:01:24.889 --> 1:01:26.599
You must recognize it
from the music video.

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:29.310
You know Jay-z and
the one with Alicia keys.

1:01:30.144 --> 1:01:32.355
It has a hundred and two stories.

1:01:32.438 --> 1:01:35.566
And around here we should
be able to see Time Square…

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:36.859
and Rock-a-Fella center.

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:37.777
Uh-mm…

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:39.696
They are kind of in the same area.

1:01:55.586 --> 1:01:57.004
The Brooklyn bridge.

1:01:58.089 --> 1:02:00.341
It took two generations
of a family to build.

1:02:00.425 --> 1:02:03.219
The contractors started
the project in 1869…

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:05.304
-and they finished it…
-Oh, fourteen years later.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:06.222
That's right.

1:02:06.305 --> 1:02:10.101
Fun fact, around 20 to 30 people
died under this original construction.

1:02:10.184 --> 1:02:12.729
including the original
designer of the bridge.

1:02:13.271 --> 1:02:14.439
What was his name again?

1:02:14.522 --> 1:02:16.524
-John A. Roebling.
-Yes, right…right.

1:02:16.607 --> 1:02:18.484
He actually got his leg
crushed by some boat.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:20.236
and they later amputated his toes.

1:02:20.319 --> 1:02:23.156
But he later died of tetanus
and his son took over the project.

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:24.407
Is it eerie?

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:25.742
Yeah.

1:02:40.506 --> 1:02:42.633
And here we are at time square.

1:02:42.717 --> 1:02:45.261
Guys, this is where the ball
drops every year for new year's eve.

1:02:45.344 --> 1:02:46.721
I don't know if you know that.

1:02:46.804 --> 1:02:49.849
They host a lot of shows in
Broadway theaters back there.

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:52.226
The ball drop started in…

1:02:52.310 --> 1:02:53.644
-1907
-1907

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:55.772
December 31st 1907.

1:02:56.731 --> 1:02:59.734
But we can take this ride

1:02:59.817 --> 1:03:02.195
Wherever it goes

1:03:02.278 --> 1:03:05.239
As long as you're with me

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:07.658
I feel at home

1:03:07.742 --> 1:03:10.536
Can you tell me why

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:12.997
Cause I wanna know

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.792
As long as you're with me

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:18.586
I feel at home

1:03:21.005 --> 1:03:23.299
I got it bad, I just wanted love

1:03:23.382 --> 1:03:26.427
I got it bad, I just needed loving

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:29.472
I got it bad, I just wanted love

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:31.766
Someone like you

1:03:31.849 --> 1:03:34.560
I got it bad, I just wanted love

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:37.522
I got it bad, I just needed loving

1:03:37.605 --> 1:03:40.358
I got it bad, I just needed love

1:03:40.441 --> 1:03:42.902
We can take this ride

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:46.823
How long did the tour guide
say we're staying here in central park?

1:03:47.448 --> 1:03:49.534
Uh… I think it was like thirty minutes.

1:03:49.617 --> 1:03:50.493
Oh, okay.

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:52.870
I'm sorry I just…

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:54.497
I had to get away from her.

1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:55.832
I know right?

1:03:55.915 --> 1:03:57.166
She's driving me crazy.

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:58.334
Crazy.

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:01.170
Want to take a ride in one of those?

1:04:01.254 --> 1:04:03.005
Oh it looks really cool.

1:04:03.089 --> 1:04:03.965
Hey, hey…

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:06.259
Do you want to come and ride
with me in one of these things?

1:04:06.342 --> 1:04:08.094
-No, thanks.
-Oh come on.

1:04:08.177 --> 1:04:11.013
Come on you can't go on these
tours without riding one of these things.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:12.723
Nah, I'll rather walk thank you.

1:04:12.807 --> 1:04:13.641
Are you sure?

1:04:13.724 --> 1:04:14.684
Yeah, I'll walk.

1:04:14.767 --> 1:04:16.060
Let's get out of here.

1:04:17.144 --> 1:04:18.104
Every time.

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:23.317
We can take this ride
Wherever it goes

1:04:25.528 --> 1:04:27.113
Uh… The vessel

1:04:27.613 --> 1:04:31.284
And we're going to head over
this direction for the final--

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:34.495
Did you know that the highline
was actually saved from demolition

1:04:34.579 --> 1:04:37.123
by neighborhood residence
in the city of New York.

1:04:37.206 --> 1:04:40.585
It actually opened in 2009
as a public space where

1:04:40.668 --> 1:04:42.879
visitors could experience nature

1:04:42.962 --> 1:04:44.839
like if you're into art and design…

1:04:44.922 --> 1:04:49.218
and other really cool
stuff like the buildings.

1:04:49.302 --> 1:04:50.803
Awesome

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:54.515
Um… can you take a picture of me here?

1:04:54.599 --> 1:04:57.727
And you can go right past
us, I just want to take a picture.

1:04:57.810 --> 1:04:58.686
You can go.

1:04:58.769 --> 1:05:00.646
Oh, you guys want me to…

1:05:01.439 --> 1:05:02.732
Yeah, come.

1:05:02.815 --> 1:05:03.941
You all go ahead.

1:05:08.946 --> 1:05:10.072
Do you want me to get in the image…

1:05:10.156 --> 1:05:12.783
-Can I --
-We don't, no, no we don't.

1:05:12.867 --> 1:05:14.493
We're good, we're good…

1:05:18.289 --> 1:05:19.999
I did it for over a year…

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:26.964
Oh, nice. Cool.

1:05:27.632 --> 1:05:29.091
Alright.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:31.177
Yes….

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:52.657
New York is so beautiful.

1:05:55.117 --> 1:05:56.327
Yeah.

1:05:56.410 --> 1:05:58.496
Really used to take my breath away.

1:05:58.996 --> 1:06:00.206
Lately, not so much.

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:03.209
Why?

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:05.378
Are you jaded?

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:07.171
No, not…

1:06:07.672 --> 1:06:08.506
Not really.

1:06:08.589 --> 1:06:09.799
Just…

1:06:11.425 --> 1:06:13.386
See all these millions of people…

1:06:14.679 --> 1:06:17.932
Feels like my special
someone… isn't out there.

1:06:19.141 --> 1:06:20.434
Aww…

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:22.770
Now…

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:26.899
But you're here.

1:06:28.442 --> 1:06:29.777
Oh, oh, Michael.

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.237
Hey Michael.

1:06:32.113 --> 1:06:34.407
Hey Michael, can you
help me take this picture.

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:35.408
Would just be a minute.

1:06:35.491 --> 1:06:36.701
-A picture.
-Yeah.

1:06:36.784 --> 1:06:37.994
Back here.

1:06:38.077 --> 1:06:39.912
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1:06:41.497 --> 1:06:42.581
Uh-mm…

1:06:45.292 --> 1:06:47.253
Do you see her over there?

1:06:48.254 --> 1:06:49.296
Young lady.

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:59.765
Young lady, that lady
is thirsty for your man.

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:03.394
You need to mark your
territory and put her in her place.

1:07:03.477 --> 1:07:04.353
Honey.

1:07:04.437 --> 1:07:06.772
Wait, I'm just telling the truth.

1:07:06.856 --> 1:07:10.443
I remember when Becky tried
that nonsense back in the seventies.

1:07:10.526 --> 1:07:14.572
I pulled out her hair and I
knocked out her front teeth

1:07:14.655 --> 1:07:17.742
Till this day she still has bald
spots and wears veneers,

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.869
and I still have my Larry

1:07:19.952 --> 1:07:20.953
I'm so sorry.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:22.621
It's okay sir.

1:07:22.705 --> 1:07:25.499
Uhm… do you know where the restroom is?

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:26.417
Yeah.

1:07:27.585 --> 1:07:29.003
-Thank you, excuse me.
-Okay.

1:07:29.086 --> 1:07:29.920
Thank you.

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:31.380
Why are you trying to call
me out like that?

1:07:31.464 --> 1:07:33.174
-I'm trying to help this child out.
-You're telling this…

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:34.884
-thirty years old story
-And you just threw me under the bus.

1:07:34.967 --> 1:07:36.594
Every time you tell this story.

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:42.224
Okay, last one here…

1:07:42.308 --> 1:07:44.101
Okay, wow.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:45.436
This is so good.

1:07:45.519 --> 1:07:49.315
Hey, we should do this again
sometime you know, just the two of us.

1:07:49.398 --> 1:07:51.317
My friend Amanda…

1:07:52.026 --> 1:07:53.152
is special.

1:07:53.694 --> 1:07:56.572
I'm trying to have a nice time with
her and you're getting in the way.

1:07:57.281 --> 1:07:58.866
Stay away.

1:08:06.665 --> 1:08:09.293
Hey, so I saw Michael on
a tour with an African lady.

1:08:09.376 --> 1:08:10.961
Wonder what he's up to.

1:08:12.379 --> 1:08:14.006
Dude, should I be surprised?

1:08:15.007 --> 1:08:16.842
I mean the guy owns
the freaking touring outfit,

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:19.804
I don't understand why he's just
trying to pass off as a regular customer.

1:08:19.887 --> 1:08:21.430
Two words for you bro…

1:08:21.514 --> 1:08:22.515
Nigerian.

1:08:22.598 --> 1:08:23.682
Scam.

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:24.809
419.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:27.645
-Those are five words.
-You get my point.

1:08:27.728 --> 1:08:29.897
Dude, when you're super rich like that,

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.817
you can't be concerned with
all these Nigerian guys come on.

1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:36.278
That is some bad shit ignorance
you just spewed out of your mouth.

1:08:36.362 --> 1:08:37.488
Look…

1:08:37.988 --> 1:08:39.490
I just call it like I see it.

1:08:39.990 --> 1:08:40.991
Just saying.

1:08:41.867 --> 1:08:42.868
Come on.

1:09:02.888 --> 1:09:04.223
Hey, where have you been?

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:06.142
I've been looking all over for you.

1:09:07.685 --> 1:09:08.769
What's wrong?

1:09:09.937 --> 1:09:11.814
Why didn't you tell me that you own the

1:09:11.897 --> 1:09:14.024
tourism outfit that has
been taking us around.

1:09:14.525 --> 1:09:15.401
I uh…

1:09:16.652 --> 1:09:18.612
-I didn’t think it was--
-Don't worry.

1:09:19.113 --> 1:09:22.449
You won't have to deal with being
scammed by yet another Nigerian.

1:09:22.950 --> 1:09:23.868
Goodbye Michael.

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:25.035
Amanda please wait.

1:09:25.119 --> 1:09:26.954
Leave me alone or
else I'll go crazy on you right here!

1:09:27.037 --> 1:09:28.164
Are you crazy?

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:44.221
I know I can be unkind

1:09:44.763 --> 1:09:48.767
But you're not always understanding

1:09:48.851 --> 1:09:52.479
I like to take my time

1:09:52.563 --> 1:09:56.609
But time is what you're always chasing

1:09:56.692 --> 1:09:59.945
I know I like to hide

1:10:03.699 --> 1:10:04.950
Hello, are you there?

1:10:05.534 --> 1:10:06.660
I'm here.

1:10:07.203 --> 1:10:09.663
Okay, so after you heard what did you do?

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:11.290
I just told him off and left.

1:10:13.751 --> 1:10:14.919
Hello?

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:16.837
Okay, he's rich.

1:10:17.588 --> 1:10:19.006
How rich are we talking about here?

1:10:19.590 --> 1:10:20.758
Seriously Kemi.

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:22.509
I just bared my soul out to you and

1:10:22.593 --> 1:10:24.220
all you can think about is rich.

1:10:25.262 --> 1:10:26.096
Okay.

1:10:26.639 --> 1:10:27.890
Have you told him about Nora?

1:10:29.516 --> 1:10:30.726
Now, look at this…

1:10:31.352 --> 1:10:33.187
Imagine if he heard you have a daughter

1:10:33.270 --> 1:10:34.855
before you had the
opportunity of telling him,

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:37.233
and he reacts
this exact way you're reacting.

1:10:37.316 --> 1:10:38.317
How would it make you feel?

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.194
You know you're not being fair right now.

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:42.363
No, life is not fair Amanda.

1:10:42.446 --> 1:10:43.697
And I’m your ride or die,

1:10:43.781 --> 1:10:45.532
I should be able to tell you the
truth when you're messing up.

1:10:45.616 --> 1:10:47.576
Like you're messing up right now babe.

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:53.832
Look…

1:10:53.916 --> 1:10:55.751
All I'm just trying to say is…

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:57.336
sleep on it.

1:10:57.836 --> 1:11:01.757
If you wake up tomorrow and
you feel the same way, that's fine.

1:11:02.341 --> 1:11:03.217
Alright, no problem.

1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:05.302
-I have to go, bye.
-Amanda I--

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:20.943
Woke up this morning

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:28.450
Come on, answer your phone.

1:11:53.434 --> 1:11:55.311
Hi, good morning.

1:11:55.394 --> 1:11:56.937
I need to speak with one of your guests.

1:11:58.981 --> 1:11:59.940
Yeah…

1:12:00.024 --> 1:12:02.276
No, I don't know. Her name is Amanda.

1:12:02.359 --> 1:12:03.777
Chimamanda Abraham.

1:12:07.823 --> 1:12:08.949
What?

1:12:11.869 --> 1:12:13.120
Amanda!

1:12:13.704 --> 1:12:14.747
Amanda!

1:12:14.830 --> 1:12:16.415
Amanda, please…

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.334
Please we have to talk.

1:12:20.878 --> 1:12:22.004
Please…

1:12:24.298 --> 1:12:25.382
Come on.

1:12:27.843 --> 1:12:28.719
Alright.

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.138
I'll get this.

1:12:32.931 --> 1:12:33.932
Come on.

1:12:36.226 --> 1:12:37.061
Look…

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:43.567
I've been hurt so many times.

1:12:45.611 --> 1:12:47.363
People always trying to rip me off,

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:49.448
even close friends.

1:12:50.532 --> 1:12:52.785
I get close to them and they disappear.

1:12:55.746 --> 1:12:57.915
How many times is someone
supposed to deal with that

1:12:57.998 --> 1:12:59.917
before they protect themselves.

1:13:02.795 --> 1:13:03.879
But I…

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:05.547
I messed up.

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.092
And I'm truly sorry.

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:15.682
What can I do to make this right?

1:13:16.225 --> 1:13:18.102
I'm not going to let you go.

1:13:24.817 --> 1:13:26.360
So um…

1:13:28.946 --> 1:13:30.823
when you got here if …

1:13:31.615 --> 1:13:33.909
you had found out that
I’ve gone to the airport,

1:13:35.285 --> 1:13:38.247
were you going to do
the whole romcom cliché thing of

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:43.502
chasing me down, and delivering
a heart felt romantic speech?

1:13:44.795 --> 1:13:46.630
That was the plan.

1:13:47.131 --> 1:13:48.048
Look…

1:13:49.007 --> 1:13:50.509
I would have surprised you.

1:13:50.592 --> 1:13:51.677
Do you think this is a movie?

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:53.720
There's no harm in trying.

1:13:56.473 --> 1:13:57.307
So…

1:13:57.391 --> 1:13:58.725
I take it my pidgin is getting better?

1:13:58.809 --> 1:14:01.061
Like absolutely excellent.

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:03.856
Oh my goodness.

1:14:04.356 --> 1:14:05.774
Wow…

1:14:16.743 --> 1:14:17.870
Thank you.

1:14:20.622 --> 1:14:22.458
Let's get this stuff,
take it back upstairs.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:23.417
Hmm?

1:14:34.887 --> 1:14:36.388
So, how… how do I know about…

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:37.514
Hmm mm…

1:14:38.015 --> 1:14:39.975
The guy who's all
in the travel and tourism

1:14:41.226 --> 1:14:42.311
Come on.

1:14:42.895 --> 1:14:44.521
Oh, excuse me.

1:14:44.605 --> 1:14:45.939
All right

1:14:46.023 --> 1:14:47.858
-I need to take this.
-All right, it's fine.

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:51.820
This is Michael, yeah talk to me.

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:01.914
Careful.

1:15:02.414 --> 1:15:03.624
There you go.

1:15:09.755 --> 1:15:11.590
Ugh… Damn looking forward to this

1:15:12.132 --> 1:15:13.550
Whoa, whoa…

1:15:13.634 --> 1:15:14.927
You got it backwards.

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:16.178
This is mine.

1:15:16.261 --> 1:15:17.221
That's hers.

1:15:18.013 --> 1:15:20.098
Why would you assume how
I want the jollof rice?

1:15:20.807 --> 1:15:22.267
I see it's spicy

1:15:22.351 --> 1:15:23.977
That's what I care for man.

1:15:24.061 --> 1:15:25.687
-Huh
-Enjoy

1:15:28.023 --> 1:15:29.149
Okay.

1:15:30.192 --> 1:15:31.193
Let's get going.

1:15:31.276 --> 1:15:34.321
Um, do you want to
take just a little bit first?

1:15:34.404 --> 1:15:35.572
I'll be all right.

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:37.199
It's kind of…

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:45.749
Heaven.

1:15:46.833 --> 1:15:48.669
It's not… too spicy?

1:15:48.752 --> 1:15:50.587
It's okay.

1:15:54.299 --> 1:15:55.175
Can I take a piece?

1:15:55.259 --> 1:15:56.468
Have at it.

1:16:03.642 --> 1:16:04.601
You see.

1:16:10.357 --> 1:16:11.316
Are you serious?

1:16:12.109 --> 1:16:13.026
What?

1:16:15.237 --> 1:16:16.738
Are you serious right now?

1:16:16.822 --> 1:16:17.906
Really?

1:16:17.990 --> 1:16:18.991
Oh my God.

1:16:20.826 --> 1:16:23.620
So, I've been coming
here since my college days,

1:16:23.704 --> 1:16:25.706
Some of my Nigerian
buddies showed it to me.

1:16:25.789 --> 1:16:26.832
I love this place

1:16:27.416 --> 1:16:29.543
Oh my goodness, look at you.

1:16:29.626 --> 1:16:30.460
Oh my goodness…

1:16:31.461 --> 1:16:33.005
What is happening?

1:16:33.505 --> 1:16:35.257
Learner, come on.

1:16:45.517 --> 1:16:48.020
Oh, that’s so tall.

1:16:48.854 --> 1:16:50.606
They don't have buildings like that?

1:16:50.689 --> 1:16:52.190
Excuse me, we do have buildings

1:16:52.274 --> 1:16:53.400
-like that in Nigeria.
-Okay.

1:16:53.483 --> 1:16:54.901
-Then why are you so impressed?
-I'm just saying that…

1:16:54.985 --> 1:16:56.653
this particular one is really tall.

1:16:56.737 --> 1:16:58.071
-Oh okay
-Yeah

1:16:58.155 --> 1:16:59.990
It all right, they're taller.

1:17:03.577 --> 1:17:04.494
What?

1:17:07.289 --> 1:17:08.624
I know it's a shot in the dark.

1:17:08.707 --> 1:17:09.583
But…

1:17:10.292 --> 1:17:11.752
I'm going to put it out there

1:17:12.252 --> 1:17:14.004
I think you should stay a few more days.

1:17:16.048 --> 1:17:18.050
-What?
-Michael come on.

1:17:19.426 --> 1:17:21.053
We just started warming up to each other.

1:17:22.346 --> 1:17:23.221
I feel like…

1:17:23.722 --> 1:17:26.433
We just started being honest, I want
you to know the real me better.

1:17:29.978 --> 1:17:31.396
-I'm thinking…
-Come on.

1:17:32.064 --> 1:17:34.274
-Come on.
-Thinking…

1:17:38.904 --> 1:17:39.821
Just saying.

1:17:39.905 --> 1:17:42.282
-It's insanity, that's what that is
-I know right.

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:43.325
Whatever.

1:17:46.787 --> 1:17:47.829
And so,

1:17:49.122 --> 1:17:52.834
now that you have finally
emotionally blackmailed me

1:17:53.418 --> 1:17:55.253
into staying a few more days,

1:17:55.962 --> 1:17:57.297
what's the plan?

1:17:57.381 --> 1:17:58.340
Well…

1:17:59.508 --> 1:18:02.678
I'd like to take you to a place
where I only take the closest people.

1:18:03.303 --> 1:18:04.304
Hmm…

1:18:04.388 --> 1:18:05.347
You'd love it.

1:18:05.430 --> 1:18:06.932
But, you'd find it hard to leave.

1:18:09.476 --> 1:18:10.727
Okay, okay.

1:18:11.228 --> 1:18:14.064
So, where is this magical place?

1:18:15.732 --> 1:18:16.608
My home.

1:18:20.946 --> 1:18:22.823
Uh-mm, Okay.

1:18:29.705 --> 1:18:30.580
I'm….

1:18:31.123 --> 1:18:32.582
I'm going to have to tell you something.

1:18:33.834 --> 1:18:34.668
Okay.

1:18:36.712 --> 1:18:38.630
At least, you can tell me anything.

1:18:42.384 --> 1:18:43.427
I…

1:18:44.177 --> 1:18:46.012
Amanda, you can trust me.

1:18:47.514 --> 1:18:48.432
You can feel safe.

1:18:48.932 --> 1:18:49.808
I mean…

1:18:50.308 --> 1:18:51.143
Unless…

1:18:52.978 --> 1:18:54.688
Please don't tell me you're a vegetarian

1:18:54.771 --> 1:18:55.939
I can't deal.

1:18:57.774 --> 1:18:58.942
Stop making me laugh.

1:19:00.193 --> 1:19:01.027
Um…

1:19:03.447 --> 1:19:04.614
So the thing is…

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:09.202
I have a daughter.

1:19:10.662 --> 1:19:11.580
Alright.

1:19:14.332 --> 1:19:15.167
And?

1:19:15.709 --> 1:19:17.002
That's it.

1:19:17.085 --> 1:19:18.086
I have a daughter.

1:19:18.587 --> 1:19:19.796
I--

1:19:20.505 --> 1:19:21.465
I… I

1:19:22.174 --> 1:19:23.675
I don't understand, what…

1:19:24.634 --> 1:19:26.386
What are you expecting?

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:28.972
That's meant to be a
deal breaker for guys right?

1:19:31.349 --> 1:19:32.851
What guys have you been hanging out with?

1:19:32.934 --> 1:19:34.269
Are you serious?

1:19:34.352 --> 1:19:36.229
Is this a Nigerian thing?

1:19:36.313 --> 1:19:38.565
Do guys over there they just…come on.

1:19:39.149 --> 1:19:40.650
They just run away?

1:19:42.277 --> 1:19:43.570
You're not joking with me right now?

1:19:43.653 --> 1:19:46.156
No I'm not, like are you for real?

1:19:46.239 --> 1:19:48.700
You're making me worried about
who you've been spending your time with,

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:50.118
because this doesn't make sense to me.

1:19:50.202 --> 1:19:51.077
It's like…

1:19:52.954 --> 1:19:54.706
my opinion of…

1:19:55.207 --> 1:19:56.249
kind of questioning.

1:19:56.333 --> 1:19:57.834
I'd love to meet your daughter.

1:19:58.502 --> 1:19:59.586
What's her name?

1:20:00.170 --> 1:20:01.338
Chimnoram.

1:20:01.838 --> 1:20:02.672
Chim…

1:20:03.632 --> 1:20:04.591
Can I just say "Nora"?

1:20:04.674 --> 1:20:05.759
Yeah

1:20:06.843 --> 1:20:09.805
I was just messing with you,
that's what everybody calls her.

1:20:09.888 --> 1:20:12.098
-I guess.
-So Chimnoram means…

1:20:12.599 --> 1:20:15.894
"As long as God is in control,
everything will be okay".

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:18.897
It's deep.

1:20:20.315 --> 1:20:22.067
Wish I had a Nigerian name,

1:20:22.150 --> 1:20:23.235
could be Nigerian…

1:20:24.277 --> 1:20:26.571
-I guess I'd have to be black first right?
-Yes, that.

1:20:27.113 --> 1:20:28.448
There is that…

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:31.284
Nora.

1:20:32.577 --> 1:20:33.787
I guess she's a lovely girl.

1:20:34.663 --> 1:20:35.580
Just like her mum.

1:20:41.461 --> 1:20:42.295
What?

1:20:44.673 --> 1:20:46.800
You had me thinking
we were going to be out,

1:20:46.883 --> 1:20:48.969
burying a body together or something.

1:20:49.052 --> 1:20:51.555
And then I find out you have a daughter.

1:20:52.764 --> 1:20:53.765
You're weird.

1:20:56.935 --> 1:20:57.978
No, come here, come here.

1:20:59.271 --> 1:21:00.313
I want to be…

1:21:00.856 --> 1:21:02.983
A part of, each and
every part of your life.

1:21:04.067 --> 1:21:04.901
In totality.

1:21:07.988 --> 1:21:08.822
Come here.

1:21:15.370 --> 1:21:17.122
You're going to make me cry.

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:21.084
Let's go.

1:22:23.021 --> 1:22:24.022
Fine day isn't it?

1:22:24.105 --> 1:22:24.940
Yeah.

1:22:26.024 --> 1:22:26.900
It's beautiful.

1:22:28.151 --> 1:22:28.985
Right?

1:22:29.527 --> 1:22:31.404
-This is us, my old and faithful.
-Oh

1:22:33.239 --> 1:22:34.115
Texas?

1:22:36.117 --> 1:22:37.035
Long story.

1:22:37.953 --> 1:22:39.037
Let's go get your bag.

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:39.955
Okay.

1:22:44.709 --> 1:22:45.627
Alright.

1:22:47.796 --> 1:22:50.048
-So gentlemanly…
-There you go, I do what I can.

1:22:50.131 --> 1:22:51.091
Thank you.

1:22:53.385 --> 1:22:56.596
Let's just take a ride along the bay

1:22:58.223 --> 1:23:02.268
We don't need to work
We can sit around and play

1:23:02.352 --> 1:23:06.106
After waiting for so long to get away

1:23:07.607 --> 1:23:12.362
Baby don't hold back,
All you gotta do is say

1:23:12.445 --> 1:23:18.868
What would you like
To be satisfied with me

1:23:20.537 --> 1:23:25.125
I've been counting moments of love

1:23:25.208 --> 1:23:29.754
I've been catching signs from above

1:23:29.838 --> 1:23:34.259
‎All I wanna do is satisfy you

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:41.516
Baby all you want is
To be satisfied with me

1:23:44.811 --> 1:23:46.938
Um, how much further are we going?

1:23:47.605 --> 1:23:48.815
Oh, we'll be there soon.

1:23:50.608 --> 1:23:52.402
My little slice of heaven,
you're gonna love it.

1:23:53.486 --> 1:23:54.988
Why do you think so?

1:23:57.824 --> 1:24:01.119
So, you remember that blog entry
you wrote about your bucket list?

1:24:01.619 --> 1:24:03.580
And on it, there was cabin in the woods.

1:24:03.663 --> 1:24:05.749
Have you really read all my blog posts?

1:24:05.832 --> 1:24:06.958
Of course.

1:24:08.668 --> 1:24:10.336
Look, I think you're a great writer.

1:24:11.504 --> 1:24:12.505
To be honest,

1:24:13.214 --> 1:24:15.675
I'm kind of hoping you might
write an article while we're here.

1:24:16.676 --> 1:24:18.053
Witness greatness at work.

1:24:19.179 --> 1:24:21.639
Be careful what you wish for

1:24:21.723 --> 1:24:22.724
Yeah…

1:24:23.933 --> 1:24:25.351
‎Alright.

1:24:26.144 --> 1:24:27.520
That's what I'm talking about.

1:24:27.604 --> 1:24:29.606
Finger crossed, no promises.

1:24:29.689 --> 1:24:31.024
Okay.

1:24:31.107 --> 1:24:32.484
You get me all excited now.

1:24:32.567 --> 1:24:35.904
We've been drinking
Champagne on the beach of Malibu

1:24:37.655 --> 1:24:39.824
Cruising down the boulevard

1:24:39.908 --> 1:24:43.286
Kissing in the back seat of the car

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.040
Making love under the stars

1:24:47.123 --> 1:24:53.505
How would you like
To be satisfied with me

1:24:55.173 --> 1:24:59.761
I've been counting moments of love

1:24:59.844 --> 1:25:04.474
I've been catching signs from above

1:25:04.557 --> 1:25:08.770
All I wanna do is satisfy you

1:25:09.395 --> 1:25:16.152
Baby all you want is
To be satisfied with me

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:17.946
It's like the middle of nowhere.

1:25:18.446 --> 1:25:19.656
Don't like the mountains?

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:21.950
-It's beautiful right?
-New experience.

1:25:23.785 --> 1:25:24.786
Alright.

1:25:24.869 --> 1:25:27.747
All I wanna do is satisfy you

1:25:28.581 --> 1:25:35.255
Baby all you want is
To be satisfied with me

1:25:37.757 --> 1:25:38.675
After you.

1:25:41.845 --> 1:25:43.555
Whoa.

1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:50.311
This is another romcom cliché but…

1:25:53.857 --> 1:25:55.483
Welcome to my humble abode.

1:25:58.111 --> 1:25:58.945
So…

1:26:00.155 --> 1:26:01.114
Nice.

1:26:04.117 --> 1:26:05.076
Whoa…

1:26:07.704 --> 1:26:08.872
Wow…

1:26:11.875 --> 1:26:14.210
That's a lot of dead animals.

1:26:15.628 --> 1:26:18.214
Well, I can't take credit for all of them.

1:26:19.299 --> 1:26:20.341
But it's home.

1:26:29.475 --> 1:26:31.269
No, no, no… It's okay, it's okay.

1:26:31.811 --> 1:26:32.729
It's just Edna.

1:26:33.438 --> 1:26:34.689
She…

1:26:34.772 --> 1:26:36.107
She takes care of the house for me.

1:26:36.191 --> 1:26:37.108
Oh…

1:26:37.192 --> 1:26:39.569
She's known me since I was an errant teen.

1:26:40.403 --> 1:26:42.614
Edna, you can not be
sneaking up on us like that.

1:26:42.697 --> 1:26:43.698
No, it's okay.

1:26:43.781 --> 1:26:45.283
It's okay… she…

1:26:45.366 --> 1:26:46.534
It's fine, no problem.

1:26:47.202 --> 1:26:48.620
So you're taking her side now?

1:26:50.246 --> 1:26:51.122
Edna?

1:26:51.915 --> 1:26:54.542
This is Amanda, she's our guest.

1:26:55.293 --> 1:26:56.586
Nice to meet you ma.

1:26:57.587 --> 1:26:59.088
Um… Edna.

1:27:06.888 --> 1:27:08.932
She not the most talkative.

1:27:11.017 --> 1:27:12.393
I really should let her go but,

1:27:13.394 --> 1:27:15.021
I keep her around because
she doesn't have anyone.

1:27:16.022 --> 1:27:16.898
She's like me.

1:27:16.981 --> 1:27:18.233
Aww…

1:27:19.275 --> 1:27:20.985
But, let's get you moved in.

1:30:31.968 --> 1:30:34.345
For all the pain that you have caused me.

1:30:35.680 --> 1:30:40.935
That child you're carrying
will cause you so much pain.

1:30:41.477 --> 1:30:43.396
So much more.

1:30:43.479 --> 1:30:46.274
So much more pain.

1:30:46.357 --> 1:30:48.109
More.

1:31:14.594 --> 1:31:16.512
No, no, no…

1:31:21.934 --> 1:31:23.394
More…

1:31:25.521 --> 1:31:26.439
What happened?

1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:30.943
I had a nightmare.

1:31:32.987 --> 1:31:34.030
Come here.

1:31:38.159 --> 1:31:39.118
Do you want to talk about it?

1:31:55.051 --> 1:31:57.261
So what your father said….

1:31:57.345 --> 1:31:58.221
The curse.

1:32:00.556 --> 1:32:02.767
It sounds like it did some
serious emotional damage.

1:32:09.523 --> 1:32:11.150
Sometimes I…

1:32:15.071 --> 1:32:16.447
My daughter Nora…

1:32:20.076 --> 1:32:24.247
I feel like maybe my dad's
curse is in effect, you know?

1:32:24.997 --> 1:32:29.543
She's always so moody
and so defiant, like I…

1:32:31.921 --> 1:32:33.256
I think she hates me.

1:32:33.839 --> 1:32:36.550
That's just a teenager, it's normal.

1:32:37.051 --> 1:32:38.094
They're always abnormal.

1:32:40.721 --> 1:32:42.348
What your dad said, that's…

1:32:45.142 --> 1:32:47.895
That's just the pained words
of a control freak parent.

1:32:48.938 --> 1:32:51.524
What you want to do,
what you want to believe,

1:32:52.483 --> 1:32:53.609
that's all that matters.

1:33:00.241 --> 1:33:01.158
Thank you.

1:33:01.701 --> 1:33:02.785
Doctor Phil.

1:33:03.452 --> 1:33:04.662
You're welcome ma'am.

1:33:06.372 --> 1:33:08.499
-I think I'm more a Tony Robbins guy.
-Um-hmm…

1:33:09.250 --> 1:33:10.835
-I hear you.
-Yeah.

1:33:25.891 --> 1:33:27.435
It has been,

1:33:28.185 --> 1:33:29.186
so long…

1:33:30.146 --> 1:33:31.439
since I've been this happy.

1:33:34.984 --> 1:33:36.569
I finally feel at peace.

1:33:46.746 --> 1:33:49.123
With everything that
happened to you in Nigeria,

1:33:50.291 --> 1:33:51.667
I just want you to stay,

1:33:52.293 --> 1:33:53.669
I can take care of you.

1:33:56.213 --> 1:33:57.089
You complete me.

1:33:57.882 --> 1:33:59.258
I'm never letting you go.

1:34:00.217 --> 1:34:01.052
Never.

1:34:16.275 --> 1:34:18.194
My stomach just growled.

1:34:21.113 --> 1:34:22.323
I need food.

1:34:27.036 --> 1:34:28.454
I'll go serve dinner, okay?

1:34:28.537 --> 1:34:31.540
Aww… so romantic.

1:34:31.624 --> 1:34:32.833
You just relax here.

1:35:01.278 --> 1:35:02.696
-Go…
-Jesus!

1:35:05.324 --> 1:35:06.784
Good evening Edna.

1:35:07.827 --> 1:35:08.828
Go…

1:35:24.427 --> 1:35:25.719
Ah…

1:35:27.054 --> 1:35:28.556
I hope you enjoyed dinner?

1:35:28.639 --> 1:35:29.723
I did.

1:35:30.224 --> 1:35:31.267
Thank you.

1:35:31.350 --> 1:35:32.184
Yeah.

1:35:35.146 --> 1:35:37.815
So when are we leaving for
the airport tomorrow morning?

1:35:39.275 --> 1:35:41.235
It's a long way out here.

1:35:41.735 --> 1:35:43.446
I don't want to be late for my flight.

1:35:45.114 --> 1:35:45.990
Well…

1:35:48.409 --> 1:35:50.035
I was hoping you'd stay a little longer.

1:35:51.537 --> 1:35:52.538
Seriously.

1:35:52.621 --> 1:35:55.166
Whatever the charge
is to change it, I'll take care of it.

1:35:57.835 --> 1:35:59.003
Actually,

1:36:01.630 --> 1:36:04.758
I originally booked
two weeks for this trip.

1:36:04.842 --> 1:36:06.218
-But…
-No buts.

1:36:06.302 --> 1:36:07.720
My travel agent will handle it.

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:10.389
But Nora.

1:36:11.974 --> 1:36:13.809
I need to get back to my daughter.

1:36:14.477 --> 1:36:15.978
She's not talking to me right now.

1:36:18.772 --> 1:36:21.442
Pulling a Nora card that's pretty low.

1:36:22.234 --> 1:36:23.486
No…

1:36:23.569 --> 1:36:24.570
-Alright
-Come on.

1:36:24.653 --> 1:36:25.529
Alright.

1:36:27.198 --> 1:36:28.741
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

1:36:29.325 --> 1:36:30.743
There you go.

1:36:30.826 --> 1:36:33.245
Somebody is missing me already.

1:36:34.205 --> 1:36:35.247
Yes.

1:36:38.417 --> 1:36:40.336
Alright, I'll take this.

1:36:40.419 --> 1:36:41.670
Leave it, I'll get it.

1:36:43.047 --> 1:36:46.759
Why not, I'm not doing anything
right now, and you made dinner

1:36:46.842 --> 1:36:47.843
so…

1:36:47.927 --> 1:36:48.969
Go freshen up.

1:36:49.637 --> 1:36:50.971
It's your last night after all

1:36:52.890 --> 1:36:53.807
-Okay.
-Go on.

1:36:55.518 --> 1:36:56.352
‎Yeah.

1:36:58.395 --> 1:36:59.855
Are you okay?

1:36:59.939 --> 1:37:00.773
I'm fine.

1:37:00.856 --> 1:37:03.484
I just had a little bit too much.

1:37:04.151 --> 1:37:04.985
Amanda!

1:37:14.119 --> 1:37:15.788
Thank God, you're awake.

1:37:20.251 --> 1:37:21.585
Come here.

1:37:24.004 --> 1:37:24.838
Edna.

1:37:24.922 --> 1:37:27.383
You have to stop scaring
my guest, please leave.

1:37:31.637 --> 1:37:32.513
I'm sorry about that.

1:37:33.973 --> 1:37:35.099
How are you feeling?

1:37:40.437 --> 1:37:41.564
My head hurts.

1:37:43.566 --> 1:37:44.775
What time is it?

1:37:45.609 --> 1:37:46.610
It's about 9am.

1:37:47.820 --> 1:37:51.156
-My flight
-No, no… you can't…

1:37:51.740 --> 1:37:53.200
You can't go on a trip right now.

1:37:54.535 --> 1:37:55.744
I've called my doctor.

1:37:55.828 --> 1:37:57.413
He's on his way down to see you now.

1:37:57.496 --> 1:37:59.039
-Yes, but I--
-I understand

1:37:59.123 --> 1:38:00.499
I understand, I do.

1:38:00.583 --> 1:38:03.127
You can't go on a long
trip right now, I won't allow it.

1:38:04.420 --> 1:38:05.462
I'm going to get you better.

1:38:05.963 --> 1:38:08.465
Okay, you'll be back
on your feet in no time.

1:38:09.049 --> 1:38:10.593
You can jet off to see your Nora.

1:38:10.676 --> 1:38:12.094
Yes but… I--

1:38:13.804 --> 1:38:15.222
Here, here… water

1:38:16.098 --> 1:38:17.141
Water.

1:38:20.311 --> 1:38:21.353
Drink.

1:38:23.230 --> 1:38:24.231
There you go.

1:38:25.983 --> 1:38:26.859
Is it better?

1:38:27.818 --> 1:38:28.652
Yeah.

1:38:28.736 --> 1:38:29.612
Good…

1:38:32.531 --> 1:38:33.782
Rest sweetheart.

1:38:34.491 --> 1:38:36.327
I'll make you some chicken soup, okay.

1:39:31.006 --> 1:39:33.342
Look what we have here.

1:39:35.719 --> 1:39:37.221
A few servings of this…

1:39:38.263 --> 1:39:39.682
You'll be better in no time.

1:39:40.265 --> 1:39:41.225
Hey?

1:39:42.017 --> 1:39:42.935
Wake up.

1:39:43.811 --> 1:39:44.687
Hey wake up

1:39:45.229 --> 1:39:46.188
I got you soup.

1:39:47.314 --> 1:39:48.899
Wake up I got you soup.

1:39:49.608 --> 1:39:50.484
Come on

1:39:51.110 --> 1:39:52.236
You need to sit up.

1:39:53.737 --> 1:39:55.155
Come on.

1:39:55.739 --> 1:39:56.907
I got you.

1:39:58.242 --> 1:39:59.702
Here we go.

1:40:00.661 --> 1:40:01.704
Now…

1:40:05.332 --> 1:40:06.792
Ready and…

1:40:08.168 --> 1:40:09.211
in…

1:40:10.337 --> 1:40:11.213
Come on.

1:40:15.259 --> 1:40:16.635
I'm only going to say this once.

1:40:17.177 --> 1:40:20.889
You're not to come in here until I
say otherwise, do you understand?

1:40:29.231 --> 1:40:30.524
Here we go.

1:40:30.607 --> 1:40:31.483
Please…

1:40:32.901 --> 1:40:35.154
Please, take me back to--

1:40:35.237 --> 1:40:37.281
I will.

1:40:37.364 --> 1:40:38.991
But you have to get well first.

1:40:39.074 --> 1:40:40.284
-Yes, please.
-Yes.

1:40:40.367 --> 1:40:43.036
-I need to… please.
-I know, I know, sit, sit.

1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:44.288
-Relax…
-You're stressing me.

1:40:44.371 --> 1:40:46.331
Stressing will not make it any better.

1:40:47.249 --> 1:40:48.500
-I need to get--
-Here, here, here…

1:40:49.168 --> 1:40:50.294
Back, back.

1:40:50.377 --> 1:40:52.337
Got you. Have some.

1:40:52.421 --> 1:40:53.589
Here we go.

1:40:53.672 --> 1:40:54.923
Come on, come on.

1:40:55.591 --> 1:40:56.800
That's it

1:40:56.884 --> 1:40:58.427
You're going to be okay.

1:40:58.969 --> 1:41:00.554
You're going to be okay.

1:41:02.181 --> 1:41:03.265
There you go.

1:41:03.348 --> 1:41:05.350
There we go.

1:41:06.059 --> 1:41:07.478
Let me get the water.

1:41:09.730 --> 1:41:10.564
Have some water.

1:41:11.732 --> 1:41:12.733
Yeah.

1:41:13.525 --> 1:41:14.526
There…

1:41:14.610 --> 1:41:16.361
Now, just relax.

1:41:19.281 --> 1:41:20.574
You're going to be alright.

1:41:21.575 --> 1:41:23.118
I'm here to take care of you.

1:41:24.369 --> 1:41:26.121
I'll be here till the very end.

1:41:59.613 --> 1:42:01.114
Hey pumpkin, you're not sleeping?

1:42:01.198 --> 1:42:02.533
Have you spoken to mum?

1:42:02.616 --> 1:42:04.326
I've been calling her
but she's not answering.

1:42:04.409 --> 1:42:07.621
Nora, I'm sure she's
very busy. She's fine.

1:42:08.205 --> 1:42:09.998
Don't worry she'll call you tomorrow okay.

1:42:10.499 --> 1:42:11.333
Okay.

1:42:11.416 --> 1:42:14.753
Now, go grab some sleep
and stop worrying your pretty head.

1:42:15.879 --> 1:42:17.089
I love you.

1:42:22.010 --> 1:42:23.637
Hey… Amanda.

1:42:32.312 --> 1:42:33.272
Again?

1:42:41.071 --> 1:42:43.156
Babe, what's going on?

1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:45.617
What's up with this radio
silence? I don't understand.

1:42:45.701 --> 1:42:47.744
Nora and I have been
trying to reach you for like…

1:42:47.828 --> 1:42:49.288
…forever and nothing

1:42:49.371 --> 1:42:53.041
You didn't even think to send us
a simple message on WhatsApp.

1:42:53.542 --> 1:42:54.835
It doesn't make sense.

1:42:54.918 --> 1:42:58.005
You can't just meet a
man and forget about us.

1:42:58.088 --> 1:42:59.631
Is the "thing" really that good?

1:43:01.592 --> 1:43:03.468
Oh…

1:43:04.803 --> 1:43:06.221
Um…

1:43:07.306 --> 1:43:08.724
So, your mum came.

1:43:09.474 --> 1:43:11.101
And your sister.

1:43:11.852 --> 1:43:13.562
And they said something like…

1:43:14.062 --> 1:43:15.772
you blocked them.

1:43:17.065 --> 1:43:19.318
Babe, honestly I hope you're fine.

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:22.696
Whatever it is, just
buzz us when you can, okay?

1:43:23.196 --> 1:43:24.781
And greet hubby for us.

1:43:25.949 --> 1:43:28.911
I miss you, I miss you.

1:43:33.332 --> 1:43:34.541
Bye…

1:43:59.942 --> 1:44:02.235
Baby, you're looking so much better today.

1:44:04.738 --> 1:44:06.073
It's time for soup.

1:44:06.156 --> 1:44:07.824
It's really helping you get better.

1:44:08.909 --> 1:44:09.785
-No…
-Come on.

1:44:09.868 --> 1:44:11.536
-Come on, I'll sit you up.
-No…

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:12.537
Come on.

1:44:14.581 --> 1:44:16.166
-There we go.
-Babe…

1:44:16.249 --> 1:44:17.084
Yeah.

1:44:17.584 --> 1:44:19.044
Please take me back.

1:44:19.544 --> 1:44:22.255
You need to eat, you
need to regain your strength.

1:44:22.339 --> 1:44:24.925
Please, I need to go back.

1:44:25.676 --> 1:44:26.885
My daughter.

1:44:27.469 --> 1:44:29.513
They'll be worried about me.

1:44:29.596 --> 1:44:31.139
-Please.
-We'll go.

1:44:31.848 --> 1:44:32.724
We'll go.

1:44:34.142 --> 1:44:36.603
We just have to get you stronger.

1:44:37.604 --> 1:44:38.647
You promise?

1:44:39.690 --> 1:44:40.774
Cross my heart.

1:44:41.608 --> 1:44:42.567
I love you.

1:44:43.527 --> 1:44:44.444
Now come on.

1:44:45.278 --> 1:44:46.446
Just a little bit of soup.

1:45:36.830 --> 1:45:38.040
My phone…

1:45:49.092 --> 1:45:50.093
My phone.

1:46:09.613 --> 1:46:10.739
Edna?

1:46:11.573 --> 1:46:12.491
My phone.

1:46:14.076 --> 1:46:15.869
Please do you know where my phone is?

1:46:19.498 --> 1:46:21.083
Edna my phone.

1:46:37.474 --> 1:46:38.350
There you are.

1:46:39.309 --> 1:46:41.144
You had us worried, what happened?

1:46:41.770 --> 1:46:42.687
I saw her.

1:46:44.898 --> 1:46:46.066
I saw her.

1:46:46.983 --> 1:46:48.819
You saw who? Edna?

1:46:52.405 --> 1:46:53.240
Liz.

1:46:53.740 --> 1:46:54.741
I saw…

1:46:54.825 --> 1:46:55.700
I saw her.

1:46:55.784 --> 1:46:56.952
Liz?

1:47:02.290 --> 1:47:03.500
This is worse than I thought.

1:47:03.583 --> 1:47:05.127
You… you're hallucinating.

1:47:05.210 --> 1:47:06.086
No.

1:47:06.169 --> 1:47:07.629
Ask, Edna saw…

1:47:08.213 --> 1:47:09.339
Ask Edna.

1:47:11.007 --> 1:47:11.842
Edna…

1:47:17.764 --> 1:47:18.807
Was someone here?

1:47:21.476 --> 1:47:22.727
You saw her.

1:47:24.312 --> 1:47:25.438
You saw her.

1:47:25.522 --> 1:47:26.565
You saw her.

1:47:26.648 --> 1:47:28.650
We'll need to get you to a hospital.

1:47:30.944 --> 1:47:33.155
Please, my phone.

1:47:34.573 --> 1:47:35.782
Do you have it?

1:47:36.366 --> 1:47:37.576
Yes, it's with me.

1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:38.994
Okay.

1:47:40.036 --> 1:47:41.496
Please I need it.

1:47:42.122 --> 1:47:42.998
Okay.

1:47:43.081 --> 1:47:44.082
Give me a second.

1:47:55.927 --> 1:47:56.761
Michael.

1:47:58.013 --> 1:47:59.055
Michael, did…

1:47:59.139 --> 1:48:00.348
Did you lock the door?

1:48:01.183 --> 1:48:02.184
Back to bed dear.

1:48:03.226 --> 1:48:04.060
Michael.

1:48:05.937 --> 1:48:06.771
Please.

1:48:07.522 --> 1:48:08.899
Open the door.

1:48:09.608 --> 1:48:10.483
I can't.

1:48:12.444 --> 1:48:14.613
It's for your own safety,
you're hallucinating now.

1:48:14.696 --> 1:48:16.865
Michael, you don't know that.

1:48:16.948 --> 1:48:20.202
You're not a doctor, I
need a doctor please.

1:48:21.036 --> 1:48:22.579
I used to be a paramedic.

1:48:22.662 --> 1:48:23.955
I know a thing or two.

1:48:24.039 --> 1:48:25.749
Oh, let me out…

1:48:25.832 --> 1:48:28.168
Please, let me out.

1:48:30.086 --> 1:48:31.421
Please…

1:48:31.922 --> 1:48:33.673
Get some rest dear.

1:48:39.095 --> 1:48:41.181
Please…

1:48:45.227 --> 1:48:47.562
Please, let me out.

1:49:15.173 --> 1:49:16.383
Michael.

1:49:17.467 --> 1:49:18.301
Michael.

1:49:18.927 --> 1:49:20.053
Who's there?

1:49:46.288 --> 1:49:47.247
No time…

1:49:47.330 --> 1:49:50.166
Quick, come, come…

1:50:35.879 --> 1:50:36.963
Edna?

1:50:37.756 --> 1:50:39.090
Edna.

1:50:42.844 --> 1:50:44.804
Edna.

1:50:54.272 --> 1:50:57.025
Hey, please you need to be quiet.

1:50:57.108 --> 1:50:59.027
I'm trying to help you.

1:50:59.110 --> 1:51:01.571
Your life is in danger, we
need to get out of here now.

1:51:02.364 --> 1:51:05.617
Several women, mostly Nigerian,
arrive the states then disappear.

1:51:06.201 --> 1:51:07.827
Michael is our prime suspect.

1:51:07.911 --> 1:51:11.539
They can all be traced to him as the
last contact before he went missing.

1:51:11.623 --> 1:51:12.749
He is sick.

1:51:12.832 --> 1:51:15.001
We need to get out of here now. Before--

1:51:15.085 --> 1:51:15.919
Don't move!

1:51:17.504 --> 1:51:18.588
What's going on.

1:51:20.382 --> 1:51:23.093
I’m detective Sanders
and you’re under arrest.

1:51:23.843 --> 1:51:25.345
Arrest? But what for?

1:51:25.428 --> 1:51:27.430
The kidnapping of Amanda Abraham.

1:51:28.348 --> 1:51:29.307
Don't be ridiculous.

1:51:29.391 --> 1:51:32.310
I will shoot you if you
move any closer right now.

1:51:36.272 --> 1:51:39.984
Like Amanda, most of the women you
bring here are never heard from again.

1:51:40.610 --> 1:51:42.278
-You killed them.
-What!

1:51:42.362 --> 1:51:43.947
Get on your knees.

1:51:44.572 --> 1:51:45.615
Amanda.

1:51:46.157 --> 1:51:47.075
Are you okay?

1:51:47.158 --> 1:51:49.244
-Did she hurt you?
-Get on your knees.

1:51:49.327 --> 1:51:51.287
Don't be afraid,
it's all going to be fine.

1:51:51.371 --> 1:51:52.747
But don't listen to her.

1:51:53.289 --> 1:51:56.709
I had some of my guys
look into her she's a nutcase.

1:51:56.793 --> 1:51:58.420
-Shut up.
-She obsesses over men,

1:51:58.503 --> 1:51:59.504
She stalks them…

1:51:59.587 --> 1:52:01.589
-Shut up.
-some of them have been killed.

1:52:01.673 --> 1:52:03.133
That badge is fake.

1:52:03.216 --> 1:52:05.343
He's lying…I to--

1:52:14.727 --> 1:52:15.812
Stay down.

1:54:22.730 --> 1:54:23.773
No time.

1:54:24.274 --> 1:54:25.525
Quick.

1:54:30.738 --> 1:54:33.283
Sweetie… where are you going?

1:54:33.366 --> 1:54:34.409
Go.

1:54:34.492 --> 1:54:35.618
Edna.

1:54:38.705 --> 1:54:40.039
After all I’ve done for you.

1:54:40.123 --> 1:54:42.041
Keeping you on when no one else would.

1:54:42.125 --> 1:54:43.001
Go.

1:54:43.084 --> 1:54:44.210
No time, go!

1:54:44.294 --> 1:54:47.005
-I'm not going without you Edna.
-You trust her?

1:54:48.631 --> 1:54:50.592
You trust her more than you trust me?

1:54:51.968 --> 1:54:54.137
She's been there for
every one of the girls.

1:54:55.221 --> 1:54:56.764
She's my family.

1:54:58.975 --> 1:55:00.393
I'm the only family she has.

1:55:00.476 --> 1:55:02.437
Say what you want.

1:55:02.937 --> 1:55:05.732
You will not kill this girl too.

1:55:06.900 --> 1:55:09.110
You, you'll have to go through me.

1:55:09.193 --> 1:55:10.695
What will you do?

1:55:11.279 --> 1:55:12.113
Hmm?

1:55:12.196 --> 1:55:13.740
Amanda, go.

1:55:13.823 --> 1:55:17.410
Come back to me and we'll
be normal again. I promise.

1:55:17.493 --> 1:55:20.204
Nothing is normal with us.

1:55:20.288 --> 1:55:22.373
You make me do evil.

1:55:22.916 --> 1:55:25.293
Because I have no choice.

1:55:26.628 --> 1:55:28.880
It stops now.

1:55:50.568 --> 1:55:51.903
Amanda!

1:56:08.086 --> 1:56:10.004
Amanda!

1:56:14.550 --> 1:56:16.094
Amanda!

1:56:18.346 --> 1:56:20.181
Amanda!

1:56:32.610 --> 1:56:34.821
There's no one else out here but us.

1:56:35.530 --> 1:56:38.199
You can go on for days
and not get anywhere.

1:56:40.702 --> 1:56:41.703
Amanda!

1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.270
I don't want to shoot you Amanda.

1:57:07.770 --> 1:57:10.189
I just want to talk, I
don't want to kill you.

1:57:11.858 --> 1:57:13.484
Amanda!

1:57:21.743 --> 1:57:24.078
I hoped, I really prayed.

1:57:25.705 --> 1:57:27.498
You said you would stay with me.

1:57:28.541 --> 1:57:30.418
I showed you nothing but love.

1:57:30.918 --> 1:57:33.337
and just like the
others, you want to leave me.

1:57:35.173 --> 1:57:37.633
Why am I so hard to love?

1:57:38.718 --> 1:57:40.970
Why are you leaving after all we shared?

1:57:48.811 --> 1:57:49.645
Don't move.

1:57:50.521 --> 1:57:51.689
I love you.

1:57:52.190 --> 1:57:53.399
I swear it.

1:57:56.277 --> 1:57:58.404
Don't cry, no, no, no…

1:57:58.488 --> 1:57:59.363
Don't cry.

1:57:59.447 --> 1:58:01.282
I don't want to see you cry.

1:58:02.533 --> 1:58:04.035
You made me mad…

1:58:04.994 --> 1:58:06.746
because you made me kill Edna.

1:58:08.790 --> 1:58:10.708
She was all I had.

1:58:10.792 --> 1:58:12.418
And you made me kill her.

1:58:12.502 --> 1:58:13.878
But you know what?

1:58:14.921 --> 1:58:16.130
I'll forgive you.

1:58:16.631 --> 1:58:18.007
I'll forgive you.

1:58:18.508 --> 1:58:21.302
If you promise not to run away again.

1:58:21.844 --> 1:58:24.138
Okay, okay, I promise.

1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:27.225
I'll get rid of the gun.

1:58:27.975 --> 1:58:29.602
-You promise?
-I promise.

1:58:30.478 --> 1:58:31.854
I promise.

1:58:34.190 --> 1:58:35.525
Can you see?

1:58:35.608 --> 1:58:37.193
I knew you'll come back.

2:00:12.205 --> 2:00:13.289
You forgot me.

2:00:13.372 --> 2:00:16.292
Don't worry, just let it happen.

2:00:16.375 --> 2:00:18.044
This time you won't wake up.

2:01:09.428 --> 2:01:12.431
He's been linked to the
disappearance of over fifteen women.

2:01:12.515 --> 2:01:13.349
What?

2:01:13.432 --> 2:01:14.809
Most of them Nigerian.

2:01:15.643 --> 2:01:18.354
Most of them we will discover
when forensics is done.

2:01:18.437 --> 2:01:21.107
They lye in those shallow graves
that you noticed in the woods.

2:01:25.236 --> 2:01:29.782
So, did he get them all
through his touring company?

2:01:30.283 --> 2:01:31.742
He never owned a touring company.

2:01:32.952 --> 2:01:34.537
We've arrested a couple of men who he paid

2:01:34.620 --> 2:01:35.955
to make women believe he's rich.

2:01:36.038 --> 2:01:37.373
He doesn't own anything.

2:01:38.082 --> 2:01:39.208
This cabin…

2:01:39.292 --> 2:01:41.168
belongs to the first victim he killed.

2:01:41.252 --> 2:01:43.087
Thanks to Liz's

2:01:43.170 --> 2:01:45.464
passion and doggedness

2:01:46.132 --> 2:01:48.467
this could have gone on for much longer.

2:01:49.635 --> 2:01:51.762
So is there anyone else
that you've seen with him?

2:01:51.846 --> 2:01:54.223
Anyone at all that could be in on this.

2:01:56.142 --> 2:01:59.770
Apart from Edna, he
did say he had no family.

2:01:59.854 --> 2:02:01.480
No, he never had family.

2:02:01.981 --> 2:02:04.150
He grew up in an orphanage
that he fled from as a teenager

2:02:04.233 --> 2:02:07.028
to avoid therapy sessions and
treatments for his mental disorder.

2:02:07.695 --> 2:02:09.905
Oh my goodness.

2:02:12.325 --> 2:02:13.409
Wait…

2:02:13.492 --> 2:02:15.870
There was a lady I met
with him in New York.

2:02:17.538 --> 2:02:19.832
He said that she was he's cousin, Natasha.

2:02:19.915 --> 2:02:21.000
Not a blood relative.

2:02:21.083 --> 2:02:22.668
They grew up in the orphanage together.

2:02:22.752 --> 2:02:25.004
That's what they called each other
at the orphanage "cousins"

2:02:25.087 --> 2:02:26.213
Yeah, we've spoken to her.

2:02:26.297 --> 2:02:28.424
She's given us the back
story on his time there.

2:02:29.383 --> 2:02:31.093
She's terribly shocked by all this,

2:02:31.177 --> 2:02:33.262
and swears she thought he
was in treatment this whole time.

2:02:34.013 --> 2:02:35.348
Wow.

2:02:35.848 --> 2:02:36.849
So…

2:02:37.350 --> 2:02:38.684
Why Nigerian women?

2:02:40.061 --> 2:02:42.355
Well, we're still gathering information

2:02:42.438 --> 2:02:44.148
but we've contacted the Nigerian Embassy.

2:02:44.231 --> 2:02:45.983
They are on standby
to take care of whatever

2:02:46.067 --> 2:02:48.027
it is that you might need
before you return home.

2:02:49.362 --> 2:02:51.197
Thank you so much.

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:52.907
Thank you so, so much.

2:02:53.491 --> 2:02:55.242
Is there anything else I
can do for you right now?

2:02:57.661 --> 2:02:58.871
I need to get this.

2:02:59.372 --> 2:03:00.831
Excuse me.

2:03:05.294 --> 2:03:06.337
Hello babe.

2:03:06.962 --> 2:03:07.797
Hello.

2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:11.092
Babe, what's going on?
Why did you just abandon everybody?

2:03:11.175 --> 2:03:12.259
Was the "thing" really that good?

2:03:12.343 --> 2:03:13.886
Long story.

2:03:13.969 --> 2:03:15.596
Can I talk to Nora please?

2:03:16.180 --> 2:03:18.057
Wait…

2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:19.308
Babe are you okay?

2:03:19.934 --> 2:03:22.395
Look, I'll gist you later,
can I just talk to my baby?

2:03:22.978 --> 2:03:24.855
Yeah, yeah… hold on.

2:03:25.398 --> 2:03:26.232
Mummy.

2:03:26.816 --> 2:03:27.983
Hello.

2:03:28.567 --> 2:03:29.735
Mummy are you okay?

2:03:29.819 --> 2:03:32.613
Mummy I'm so sorry, I've
been worried about you.

2:03:33.614 --> 2:03:36.325
I love you so, so much.

2:03:37.201 --> 2:03:39.829
I'm sorry too, I miss you.

2:03:42.790 --> 2:03:43.874
I'm coming home.

2:03:53.509 --> 2:03:54.427
Ah-ah…

2:03:54.510 --> 2:03:56.971
-Look at this. Oh, that is lovely.
-Oh my God.

2:03:57.054 --> 2:03:58.514
-You like?
-This is beautiful.

2:03:58.597 --> 2:04:00.641
-Eh, I like it too.
-Oh…

2:04:00.724 --> 2:04:02.184
But I like this one too.

2:04:02.268 --> 2:04:04.270
Yeah but this, this, this is like…

2:04:04.353 --> 2:04:06.480
like it suits my skin color.

2:04:07.940 --> 2:04:10.401
Yay, I'm getting married.

2:04:12.319 --> 2:04:13.195
Look at me.

2:04:13.279 --> 2:04:14.738
-But this is nice.
-I am getting married.

2:04:14.822 --> 2:04:19.452
-Okay, this one is for you?
-Your father and for the entire family.

2:04:19.535 --> 2:04:20.494
Okay.

2:04:22.329 --> 2:04:23.789
‎-Your father too.
‎-Okay.

2:04:25.124 --> 2:04:27.668
-Your father, me, and you.
-Okay…

2:04:35.134 --> 2:04:36.343
Mummy.

2:04:38.888 --> 2:04:39.889
Daddy.

2:04:44.226 --> 2:04:45.436
Nora.

2:04:47.897 --> 2:04:49.023
Chimnoram.

2:04:49.106 --> 2:04:50.441
Chimnoram.

2:04:51.650 --> 2:04:53.611
Chimnoram…

2:04:54.737 --> 2:04:56.322
‎Chimnoram.

2:05:05.748 --> 2:05:07.875
Chimnoram, come.

2:05:15.799 --> 2:05:17.676
Chimnoram.

2:05:23.265 --> 2:05:24.266
Oh.

2:05:26.310 --> 2:05:27.561
Chimnoram.

2:05:31.982 --> 2:05:33.442
Chimnoram.

2:05:34.193 --> 2:05:35.653
You know I missed you.

2:05:36.278 --> 2:05:37.154
It's fine.

2:05:37.238 --> 2:05:38.239
Chimnoram.

2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:47.790
Chimamanda…

2:05:49.375 --> 2:05:50.834
Chimamanda.

2:10:52.928 --> 2:10:56.849
