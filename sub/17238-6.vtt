00:36.625 --> 00:38.834
-Okay, you have four more minutes to finish your test.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.000
: Hurry up. -That's impossible!

00:41.041 --> 00:43.208
-No, no, no, no! I'm not even close to being done.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.208
-Well, better get goin'. Oh my gosh. Focus more.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.625
: A couple minutes.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.917
: What?!

00:52.959 --> 00:55.834
-Okay, I'm kidding. Oh my gosh!

00:55.875 --> 00:58.917
You guys are lame! That's so pathetic.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.333
It was a joke. You acted like a bunch of little babies.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.333
Sheila was crying.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.625
You were bawling your eyes out in your head practically.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.792
'Cause she thought, "Oh no, I'm not done my test."

01:09.834 --> 01:11.959
: I hate you!

01:12.000 --> 01:13.875
-Lori, I thought you were going to faint!

01:13.917 --> 01:16.834
Grow up! It's just a test. I might do it again.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.917
You have thirty minutes right now, but that could change at

01:16.875 --> 01:19.917
any time.

01:19.959 --> 01:22.959
Make sure you finish that test Sheila, 'cause I need that for

01:19.959 --> 01:22.959
my answer key.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.500
Okay, back to work. One minute left...

01:25.542 --> 01:28.625
: Too soon. I did it too soon.

01:28.667 --> 01:32.208
Let's just get this done, I'm bored out of my tree right now.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.959
♪ I'm awesome, no you're not dude don't lie ♪

01:35.000 --> 01:37.583

01:43.917 --> 01:48.125
-Heyyyyy, just the man I was looking for.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.959
-Not you...Chris...Hi!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.667
Here's the...pen you lent me.

01:54.709 --> 01:57.500
-Oh...Thanks. -You're welcome.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.041
Oh Bobbi, m'lady. Almost didn't see you there.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.208
Listen, I'm going to be out of commission this week.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.458
'Cause I gotta get my tonsils out. So I'm not going to be

02:05.500 --> 02:07.625
able to coach my girls volleyball team in the playoffs.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.834
-Well, that doesn't leave me much notice, Simon.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.208
-I only found out this morning. -Take a look at these puppies.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.375
: Yeah. No!

02:14.417 --> 02:16.583
Right in there. Yeah. -Yeah, got it. Thank you.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.792
'Cause I'm tied up

02:16.625 --> 02:19.792
with the rugby team, so...

02:19.834 --> 02:21.959
-Ahhh...

02:22.959 --> 02:25.000
I'll do it. -Perfect, thanks.

02:29.959 --> 02:32.125
-Ahh, because you mess everything up.

02:29.959 --> 02:32.125
: Shut up.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.583
-This team has a chance of winning everything.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.709
And I can't risk you...

02:37.875 --> 02:40.959
-Ruining everything!

02:41.000 --> 02:43.709
-I'm not going to ruin anything. That came out of left field.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.250
Why would you say that: Well, there's

02:43.750 --> 02:46.250
no one else.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.417
-There really isn't, that's the problem.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.834
So, I guess I just have to. -You could ask McNa...

02:54.125 --> 02:56.917
Okay, fine. You can coach this season's playoffs.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.959
But don't read into it. Win or lose...

02:59.000 --> 03:01.125
Does not mean you're coaching next season. Okay?

03:01.166 --> 03:03.333
-You might not be alive next year, so...

03:03.375 --> 03:06.000
-I'm gonna go prepare, thanks.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.417
: Ugh! Seriously. -I don't think he meant that,

03:08.458 --> 03:10.834
Sir...

03:10.875 --> 03:12.875
Siriously didn't mean that.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.417
-Bye! You're a woman.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.667
Chris, could I have that pen please back, ah, for borrowing?

03:25.041 --> 03:27.166
-Hurry up bipedal hominids. You were supposed to be in class

03:27.208 --> 03:29.333
ten seconds ago.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.917
Let's move it, move it! Lucifer...

03:31.959 --> 03:34.083
Late? Unacceptable.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.291
-We don't have enough time in between classes, sir.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.542
I had to use the washroom. -No excuses, Lucy.

03:38.583 --> 03:41.792
It's disrespectful to your teachers...! Ahem! Nahhh.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.917
Do I have to buy you a wrist watch, Ms Corcoran?

03:43.959 --> 03:45.834
-Sorry, it's just that I was on the third floor.

03:45.875 --> 03:48.792
And three minutes between classes, it's just not enough

03:45.875 --> 03:48.792
time.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.041
-Here's an idea!

03:51.083 --> 03:54.125
What if we added an extra minute or two to the breaks?

03:54.166 --> 03:56.041
Oh! Good idea, thank you!

03:56.083 --> 03:58.875
I just had a

03:56.083 --> 03:58.875
great idea.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.875
: Okay. -Why don't you pitch that to

03:58.917 --> 04:01.875
your fellow teachers?

04:01.917 --> 04:04.917
See how that goes over. 'Cause...

04:04.959 --> 04:06.834
-Right. Stupid.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.959
-The good news is, I'm not going to punish you, extremely hard.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.375
And the great news is, I'm going to think about what you said.

04:13.417 --> 04:16.917
Okay -Okay. Yup.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.917
: Come on guys, you can open your books at least!

04:22.166 --> 04:24.542
-Hey, big day Saturday! -Well, true.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.959
Let's not assume we're going to win Thursday.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.959
But we will, you're right. We have a good team.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.834
So, we'll probably cruise through Thursday, get to

04:29.000 --> 04:31.834
Saturday...

04:36.667 --> 04:39.959
-Spike's wedding, jackass. -Ohhhhhhh!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.959
Spike's wedding and I replied yes.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.709
-Yeah, Saturday. -Well, work comes first.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.709
Sorry Spike, can't go.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.917
-That's too bad, man, 'cause Suzie's gonna be there...

04:47.959 --> 04:50.583
And she's back on the market! !

04:52.875 --> 04:55.125
-Thirsty. -Just keep her away from

04:52.875 --> 04:55.125
everybody, okay?

04:55.166 --> 04:57.208
-Yeah, sure. I won't let anyone go near her.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.208
-Yeah.

04:57.250 --> 05:01.041
-I'll be a fence. I'll build a wall. Or, maybe she'll just

04:57.250 --> 05:01.041
hook up with whoever.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.250
: No... -That's how parties work.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.542
-Don't say that. -You should get somebody

05:03.291 --> 05:05.542
to cover for you. -I can't, I said I would do

05:05.583 --> 05:07.834
this. They said "You'll ruin it!"

05:07.875 --> 05:10.333
I said, "I won't ruin it." So, now I can't ruin it.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.417
-That doesn't sound like you. -I got it!

05:12.458 --> 05:15.625
Throw the game Thursday. I'll throw it, I'm the coach.

05:12.458 --> 05:15.625
Done, be there, Saturday.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.667
-I'm remembering it. You said it a second ago.

05:22.709 --> 05:25.375
-I have to put Jordan Steele up on the allergy board.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.542
I just found out he's allergic to shellfish.

05:27.583 --> 05:30.458
-Right, that reminds me, I just found out that I am severely

05:30.500 --> 05:33.375
allergic to soy nuts and almonds.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.083
: You're sorry?

05:36.125 --> 05:39.250
I am a nut lover! -I love nuts too!

05:39.291 --> 05:43.875
-No, no, no, I mean I love nuts.

05:43.917 --> 05:47.834
-Okay, well we need to get your photo and Epipen on the board

05:43.917 --> 05:47.834
asap.

05:47.875 --> 05:51.333
-There's two more nuts that I will no longer have the pleasure

05:51.375 --> 05:53.834
of rolling around my gullet.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.333
-Testicles.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.041
You're a squeamish little one, aren't ya?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.750
: Alright! Come on in girls.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.834
Whoo! I haven't seen some of you in awhile.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.333
You're not in my classes. Some of you were, Hannah!

06:16.375 --> 06:18.500
Had you in grade seven. And then...

06:18.542 --> 06:21.709
I haven't seen you in, like, five years. It's weird you

06:18.542 --> 06:21.709
haven't had one of my classes.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.875
-Yeah... -Thought you left the school.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.959
: Still here, well

06:23.917 --> 06:25.959
that's good.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.917
And Kathy, oh my gosh! You were on my class list this year.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.000
I went to class...I said: "Where's Kathy?"

06:33.041 --> 06:35.667
They said: "Oh she switched out." So...

06:35.709 --> 06:37.834
Almost! Almost had you in my class.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.041
: Mmm...

06:40.083 --> 06:42.208
So many courses you have to choose from.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.417
So...What'd ya take instead? -Oh, free period.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.250
That's not really a... Not really a class.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.500
Okay. Anyway...

06:54.542 --> 06:57.333
Well as you've heard, Mr. Hunt bailed!

06:57.375 --> 06:59.583
'Cause he has a sore throat.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.792
Luckily for you guys, I'm here.

07:01.834 --> 07:05.041
And I have a background in volleyball, ah was gonna

07:01.834 --> 07:05.041
play pro actually...

07:05.083 --> 07:07.208
In Europe.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.417
And then I said... I'll stay in school.

07:09.458 --> 07:12.500
In education. I played with my residence team...

07:12.542 --> 07:15.000
Instead. So! Thursday...

07:15.041 --> 07:16.917
Playoffs. It's a long year.

07:16.959 --> 07:20.583
So if you don't win Thursday, it's not the end of the world.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.792
: Good! That's what

07:20.625 --> 07:23.792
we want...

07:23.834 --> 07:25.875
But if you don't, again, not the end of the world.

07:25.917 --> 07:28.166
-It is to us.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.834
-Tricked you. Tricked you. It is to me too.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.792
So, I'm a hundred percent committed to this team.

07:32.834 --> 07:35.917
I want you to know that. I would say I'm two thousand percent

07:32.834 --> 07:35.917
committed but...

07:35.959 --> 07:37.834
Percent stops at a hundred.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.083
So, whoever the guy was that invented percentage...

07:40.125 --> 07:43.750
Or the woman. Or the woman, 'cause women can invent

07:40.125 --> 07:43.750
things too.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.041
Although it was probably a guy. 'Cause it's math, right?

07:47.083 --> 07:50.750
But let's see what we got. I want to see the starters down

07:47.083 --> 07:50.750
there and the subs down here.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.000
And let's see what I'm working with. Alright!

07:53.041 --> 07:55.750
Good to see you again, Kathy.

07:55.792 --> 07:59.333
: Let's see what I can fix. Alright.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.417
Let's see what we're made of.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.417
: Serve. :Yup. Mine, mine, mine.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.875
: Yeah, right here! :You got two,

08:04.458 --> 08:06.875
you got two!

08:06.917 --> 08:09.875
: Yes! : Ah, hello? Hi, hi!

08:09.917 --> 08:12.000
Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear.

08:12.041 --> 08:16.375
Starters there, subs are down here on this side.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.625
-Okay, you're the subs.

08:24.250 --> 08:27.041
-Uno, dos, tres.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.166
-Alright, here we go.

09:21.834 --> 09:25.083
-Okay, playoff journey begins now.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.750
Good team over there, so we will not take them lightly today.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.959
-We crushed them at the start of the season, sir.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.917
-So that means they know what we're all about.

09:32.959 --> 09:36.041
So we're gonna mix it up today. Hannah, you're gonna play

09:32.959 --> 09:36.041
middle.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.709
I play libero. Kathy plays middle, you have to be

09:36.083 --> 09:39.709
tall.

09:39.750 --> 09:43.250
-See that's the kind of defeatist attitude I don't

09:39.750 --> 09:43.250
want to hear right now.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.458
'Cause sports is 90% mental.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.875
So up here, you are just as tall as Kathy.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.125
You have to think like that. -I literally can't reach the

09:47.917 --> 09:51.125
top of the net.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.792
-Height doesn't measure heart.

09:54.917 --> 09:57.750
Kathy, ready? Setter!

09:57.792 --> 10:00.333
-I've never set in my life. -I've never done parkour.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.500
Today's a great day for both of us to learn.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.583
Last thing, we serve underhand.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.667
-Sportsmanship. Respect. You just said you killed them

10:04.625 --> 10:07.667
last time you played them.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.875
-You just told us not to take them lightly.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.792
-Trust me. This is a classy move.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.083
-They're expecting us to play intuitively. We're gonna play

10:14.000 --> 10:17.083
counter-intuitively.

10:17.125 --> 10:20.500
It's not supposed to make sense, Miss Negative, today.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.667
I don't know what that's all about.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.875
Alright, bring it in. Let's go.
