00:00.003 --> 00:01.190
<i>Previously on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:01.289 --> 00:02.680
Running's actually fun, you know?

00:02.723 --> 00:03.971
Once you get into the spirit of it.

00:03.992 --> 00:06.036
Yeah, me... I'm more of a sitting girl.

00:06.126 --> 00:08.025
Like on a bench.

00:08.061 --> 00:09.527
- Pamela Dolan.
- The photographer?

00:09.563 --> 00:11.996
I think she's been abusing her models.

00:12.031 --> 00:13.965
My arms got so tired I fell.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.367
If Pamela finds out I talked to you,

00:15.402 --> 00:17.001
she will ruin my career.

00:17.036 --> 00:19.170
I'm down to the last few names.

00:19.205 --> 00:21.106
- No one's willing to back up her story?
- No.

00:21.204 --> 00:24.342
Tia was working on this
campaign for City Council.

00:24.377 --> 00:27.378
- I went in to volunteer...
- And left as the candidate.

00:27.413 --> 00:29.280
One minute she's acting
like she's my date.

00:29.315 --> 00:30.647
<i>And then the next minute,</i>

00:30.683 --> 00:32.283
it's all endorsements and ad buys.

00:32.317 --> 00:33.784
The first time I kissed a girl

00:33.819 --> 00:35.819
it was terrifying,
'cause I knew this was

00:35.855 --> 00:39.423
<i>what I wanted,
and I don't wanna want it.</i>

00:40.659 --> 00:43.928
I'm obsessed with
harlequin romance novels

00:43.963 --> 00:46.163
and renaissance fairs.

00:46.199 --> 00:49.000
I have the most insane
collection of Snuggies,

00:49.035 --> 00:51.269
and I'm the best snuggler.

00:51.304 --> 00:52.904
My dream is to be an opera singer,

00:52.939 --> 00:54.939
so I practice a lot.

00:54.974 --> 00:56.440
A lot.

00:56.475 --> 00:58.276
So, then I told my parents,

00:58.311 --> 00:59.843
you shouldn't have called me Madeline

00:59.879 --> 01:01.612
if you don't even like the name Maddy.

01:02.748 --> 01:04.581
Makes sense.

01:04.617 --> 01:06.482
Do all three of you live here?

01:06.518 --> 01:08.051
Oh, God no.

01:08.954 --> 01:10.053
I used to.

01:10.088 --> 01:11.221
Their opinions matter.

01:11.256 --> 01:12.588
Greatly.

01:12.624 --> 01:14.024
You know what?

01:14.059 --> 01:15.425
I'm good.

01:15.460 --> 01:16.893
What does that mean, you're good?

01:16.929 --> 01:19.963
I just don't think this is gonna work.

01:19.998 --> 01:22.899
Are you... rejecting us?

01:22.935 --> 01:24.401
No, she's rejecting me.

01:24.436 --> 01:25.468
I'm the one who needs a roommate.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.736
No one's rejecting Jane.

01:26.771 --> 01:28.771
I'll see myself out.

01:30.242 --> 01:31.707
That's okay, we'll see you out.

01:31.743 --> 01:32.875
Yeah.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.415
Thank you so much for your time.

01:38.450 --> 01:40.283
We'll let you know what we decide.

01:40.319 --> 01:41.651
You're all insane.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074

01:52.363 --> 01:55.097
That's my book tour itinerary.

01:55.132 --> 01:57.666
23 cities in eight weeks.

01:59.837 --> 02:01.470
Wow.

02:02.806 --> 02:04.906
That's a lot of cities.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.076
And a lot of weeks.

02:07.531 --> 02:10.479
Well, we're here now.

02:11.748 --> 02:13.715
Yeah.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.550
We are.

02:15.586 --> 02:17.853
We should take advantage of it.
Date nights...

02:17.888 --> 02:19.488
Have sex whenever we can.

02:19.523 --> 02:21.656
Yes, we should get on that right away.

02:22.658 --> 02:23.725
Okay.

02:26.030 --> 02:27.115
So get on.

02:28.199 --> 02:29.794
Okay.

02:38.775 --> 02:40.809
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

02:42.045 --> 02:44.312
Uh... oh, wow.

02:44.347 --> 02:46.748
Yes, this is the third time

02:46.783 --> 02:48.884
someone has complained
about Ray's new pepperoni.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.520
Looks like you're gonna need
a position paper on that.

02:51.555 --> 02:53.522
Are you for or against

02:53.557 --> 02:55.991
Ray's new pepperoni pizza topping?

02:56.026 --> 02:59.060
Well, I'm pro-choice,
so I am pro-letting people

02:59.095 --> 03:00.729
choose their own pizza topping.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.964
- Very impressive.
- Thanks.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.766
I'm gonna go ahead and...

03:04.801 --> 03:06.467
- Oh.
- ...drop that Mic.

03:08.138 --> 03:11.039
Okay, tomorrow's a big day,
lots of doors to knock on.

03:11.074 --> 03:12.473
You should get some sleep.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.508
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:14.544 --> 03:17.978
You know, I do hate it,
but you are right.

03:18.014 --> 03:19.513
So...

03:19.549 --> 03:21.815
The truth hurts.

03:26.243 --> 03:27.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:27.723 --> 03:30.323
- I'm gonna go for a run.
- No, no, not again.

03:30.359 --> 03:32.225
I finally finished my
sketches for class,

03:32.261 --> 03:34.528
and I wanna celebrate
by jumping your bones.

03:34.564 --> 03:35.996
Mmm.

03:36.576 --> 03:38.131
How 'bout you jump my bones tonight?

03:38.830 --> 03:39.867
I can't.

03:39.902 --> 03:42.002
I have to stay late and
work on the fairytale thing.

03:42.038 --> 03:44.038
Come on,
I promise I'll give you a workout.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.841
If I don't go now,
I won't get a run in before work,

03:47.877 --> 03:49.910
and I really wanna get
a run in before work.

03:51.914 --> 03:53.881
Okay.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.783
I'll plan your birthday party instead.

03:56.004 --> 03:58.251
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to.

03:58.287 --> 03:59.519
It's only gonna be ten people.

03:59.555 --> 04:01.054
- You're gonna love it.
- Bye.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.789
Bye.

04:13.435 --> 04:14.901
It's just me and you, kid.

04:21.577 --> 04:23.477
Well, I made it to first base again.

04:23.512 --> 04:25.812
Ah, yes. Baseball, love it.

04:25.847 --> 04:28.047
So that makes mine a triple play.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.984
No, a grand slam,
because it's morning, night,

04:31.019 --> 04:32.498
and middle of the night sex.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.586
- Mmm.
- Wow.

04:33.622 --> 04:35.288
We're really trying to pack
it in before Ryan leaves.

04:35.324 --> 04:36.513
That sounds great. Me?

04:36.526 --> 04:40.593
I am warming the bench,
looking at the field from afar,

04:40.628 --> 04:41.860
not even in the game.

04:41.895 --> 04:43.262
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

04:43.297 --> 04:45.631
I mean, with all of my class assignments

04:45.666 --> 04:47.266
and then the fact that the Fall issue

04:47.301 --> 04:48.534
has to be so much better
than all the other issues,

04:48.569 --> 04:50.236
I'm never home. And when I am,

04:50.271 --> 04:52.671
Richard's out running with the guys.

04:52.706 --> 04:54.273
Hmm.

04:54.308 --> 04:56.275
- Is that a bad sign?
- No.

04:56.328 --> 04:58.644
No, I... I think he's probably
just trying to keep up with

04:58.679 --> 05:01.079
his 15-years-younger-
than-he-is girlfriend,

05:01.115 --> 05:03.349
especially since he's about to turn...

05:03.384 --> 05:05.083
- 41.
- Wow.

05:05.119 --> 05:06.818
I can't believe this is our
first birthday together.

05:07.336 --> 05:09.121
You guys coming canvassing today, right?

05:09.157 --> 05:11.723
Yeah, I scheduled
my whole day around it.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.825
Me, too. Except, I only have 45 minutes.

05:13.861 --> 05:16.562
Hey, are you holding
more roommate interviews?

05:16.597 --> 05:20.799
Uh, yes. Except I'm doing them
here at "Scarlet," alone.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.467
Understandable.

05:28.075 --> 05:29.875
Is Alex wearing sweatpants?

05:29.910 --> 05:31.276
- Wow.
- Hmm.

05:31.311 --> 05:33.378
You look like shit. For you, I mean.

05:33.413 --> 05:34.980
Well, thank you.

05:35.015 --> 05:37.348
It's because a pipe burst
in the apartment above me

05:37.384 --> 05:39.151
and my ceiling collapsed.

05:39.186 --> 05:41.119
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

05:41.155 --> 05:43.755
Officially homeless for
the foreseeable future.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.457
- What are the odds?
- Of a pipe bursting?

05:46.493 --> 05:47.826
- I don't know.
- No.

05:47.861 --> 05:50.461
You're homeless, Jane needs a roommate.

05:51.732 --> 05:53.131
You guys should live together.

05:54.903 --> 05:56.228
_

05:57.270 --> 05:58.337
I have an article.

05:58.372 --> 05:59.805
Yeah, I gotta go see Jacqueline...

05:59.840 --> 06:01.873
- Yep.
- I gotta go, too.

06:04.177 --> 06:06.177
Yep. Oh, hold on a second.

06:06.212 --> 06:07.344
- Jane...
- Can't hear you.

06:07.379 --> 06:09.013
Jane, no, no. No, no.

06:09.048 --> 06:10.848
You wanted an update?

06:10.883 --> 06:12.717
Uh, yes. Pamela Dolan.

06:12.752 --> 06:14.351
We need to make some headway.

06:14.386 --> 06:16.887
Yes, I took your advice,
and I tried a new angle.

06:16.923 --> 06:18.789
Since no one from the Ingrid shoot

06:18.825 --> 06:20.457
would talk to a "Scarlet" reporter,

06:20.492 --> 06:22.292
I decided we should look
into our own people,

06:22.328 --> 06:24.494
see if anybody has worked
with Pamela in the past.

06:24.530 --> 06:25.562
And?

06:25.598 --> 06:27.965
And I found a few.

06:31.237 --> 06:32.870
Hmm.

06:32.905 --> 06:35.572
Cammy Hartman...

06:35.608 --> 06:39.776
is scheduled to work with us...

06:39.812 --> 06:40.838
next month.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.513
So maybe we could get her
to come in a little earlier?

06:43.549 --> 06:45.515
Cammy goes by the pronouns
"they" and "them,"

06:45.551 --> 06:46.816
but that's a good idea.

06:46.852 --> 06:48.252
And I'll put in a call.

06:48.287 --> 06:49.819
Jane.

06:49.855 --> 06:51.888
I know. I didn't make an appointment.

06:51.923 --> 06:53.624
Oh, no. Apparently you did.

06:54.926 --> 06:57.427
Molly's here for your
roommate interview.

06:58.012 --> 07:00.797
I think you two would
make great roommates.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.304
Thank you, everyone,
for giving up your lunch break

07:07.339 --> 07:09.973
to canvass for our wonderful
candidate, Kat Edison.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.944
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll get right to it.

07:14.980 --> 07:16.613
Each of you has been
paired with a buddy,

07:16.649 --> 07:19.249
and the code on your app is
"KatEdisonCampaign."

07:19.285 --> 07:21.050
That will show you the
area we are canvassing.

07:21.086 --> 07:22.719
Please call me if you
have any questions,

07:22.755 --> 07:25.288
and let's go meet some
friendly Democrats.

07:29.327 --> 07:30.393
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:30.486 --> 07:32.588
Okay, great. So, Jane, you and I
will take one side of the block.

07:32.631 --> 07:34.430
- Kat and Sutton take the other.
- Sounds great.

07:34.499 --> 07:35.379
- Can't we go together?
- Actually,

07:35.467 --> 07:36.783
I think it's better if we don't.

07:36.868 --> 07:38.124
Oh, but we're such a great team though.

07:38.204 --> 07:40.338
Yeah, but that's why we
should divide and conquer.

07:40.438 --> 07:43.238
But, you know, Jane and Sutton

07:43.274 --> 07:44.722
know how to sell me better than I do.

07:44.776 --> 07:47.410
I did memorize the pamphlet,
and I watched the app tutorial, so...

07:47.445 --> 07:50.078
And I prefer Jane.

07:50.114 --> 07:51.580
See?

07:51.616 --> 07:53.248
- Kat, I...
- Come on, come on.

07:53.284 --> 07:54.950
It'll be great. Let's go.

07:54.985 --> 07:57.252
- No, we're actually in New York.
- Oh.

07:57.288 --> 07:58.454
Do you have a quick
moment to talk with us?

07:58.489 --> 08:00.849
- Sure.
- Your platform is really inspiring.

08:00.859 --> 08:02.791
Oh, thanks. So can we count on you?

08:02.826 --> 08:04.826
Absolutely. I'd be happy to volunteer.

08:04.861 --> 08:06.761
It was a pleasure to meet you,
Kat Edison.

08:06.797 --> 08:08.797
- Yeah, you too.
- We will be in touch.

08:08.832 --> 08:10.632
- Thanks so much.
- Bye.

08:12.168 --> 08:14.001
- There you go.
- Yeah.

08:15.171 --> 08:16.971
Okay.

08:17.922 --> 08:19.312
- What?
- Nothing.

08:19.343 --> 08:20.942
I just like doing this with you.

08:20.977 --> 08:22.744
Yeah, you too.

08:22.779 --> 08:24.312
- Let's get back out there.
- Yeah.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.615
You know what this reminds me of?

08:27.651 --> 08:28.817
My last couple days with Richard.

08:28.852 --> 08:30.418
Hello? Is anybody home?

08:31.285 --> 08:32.354
Just leave a pamphlet.

08:32.389 --> 08:34.756
He was still running
when I left this morning.

08:35.826 --> 08:37.692
Get in there.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.327
You know,
I haven't even had time to get him

08:40.363 --> 08:43.630
a present or think about
what it is that he might want.

08:44.696 --> 08:46.967
Well, why don't you get him
running shoes?

08:48.003 --> 08:49.336
I'm serious.

08:51.407 --> 08:52.973
- _
- No.

08:53.008 --> 08:54.408
Who's Norman?

08:54.443 --> 08:57.411
Norman is my potential
roommate's iguana.

08:57.446 --> 09:00.581
Therefore, Norman,
is my potential roommate.

09:00.616 --> 09:01.849
- No.
- Yes.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.905
- Come on.
- This is what you've left me with.

09:03.953 --> 09:04.961
You know what, Jane?

09:05.021 --> 09:07.153
You could also consider Alex,
who is neat

09:07.189 --> 09:08.989
and nice and temporary,
and it would give you

09:09.024 --> 09:10.790
plenty of time to find
a long-term roommate

09:10.825 --> 09:12.158
that you actually like.

09:13.906 --> 09:15.328
Iguana?

09:15.364 --> 09:17.063
- That is everyone.
- Yeah.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.965
You wanna just wait here
for Jane and Sutton?

09:19.001 --> 09:20.633
Yeah.

09:25.068 --> 09:26.515
All right.

09:26.550 --> 09:27.640
Campaign selfie?

09:27.675 --> 09:29.242
Yeah, let's do it.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.476
Just make sure you get my good side.

09:30.512 --> 09:32.145
Just kidding, I have two.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.614
- You have so many.
- Aww.

09:34.649 --> 09:37.083
- So many good sides.
- So nice.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.253
What are you doing?

09:40.289 --> 09:43.223
Oh, hi. I'm Kat Edison.

09:43.258 --> 09:44.790
We're just taking a break, we've been...

09:44.825 --> 09:46.358
Loitering?

09:46.394 --> 09:47.960
I live in this building,
and I know for a fact

09:47.995 --> 09:49.128
that you do not.

09:49.163 --> 09:50.896
You're right, we don't.

09:50.932 --> 09:52.531
Right, we were just
canvassing the neighborhood.

09:52.566 --> 09:54.233
More like casing it.

09:54.268 --> 09:56.868
That selfie was a picture
of my security system.

10:01.008 --> 10:02.274
I'm sorry?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.176
I'm actually running for City Council.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.078
I... I live in this neighborhood.

10:06.113 --> 10:07.679
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

10:08.829 --> 10:11.250
- And why is that?
- Okay. Okay, fine.

10:11.285 --> 10:13.518
Just, um, show me your phone.

10:13.554 --> 10:15.687
- Show you my phone?
- Yeah.

10:15.722 --> 10:17.122
Why would I give you my phone?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.690
Well, if you're just taking a selfie

10:18.725 --> 10:20.259
and not taking a picture
of my security system,

10:20.294 --> 10:22.226
just hand over your phone
or just show it to me.

10:22.262 --> 10:23.762
I don't have to give you my phone.

10:23.797 --> 10:24.930
- Well, I think you do.
- What's going on?

10:24.965 --> 10:27.133
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah.

10:27.174 --> 10:30.301
These two were lounging in front
of my building taking photos,

10:30.337 --> 10:32.036
and there have been
a lot of robberies here.

10:32.072 --> 10:33.371
Robberies?

10:33.406 --> 10:34.473
Are you suggesting that our friends

10:34.508 --> 10:36.475
had something to do with that?

10:36.510 --> 10:38.276
Look, I just asked them
a simple question,

10:38.311 --> 10:40.111
and they started harassing me.

10:40.146 --> 10:41.646
- Harassing you?
- Yeah.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.981
We were explaining that
we were canvassing.

10:43.016 --> 10:44.315
Which is perfectly legal.

10:44.351 --> 10:45.784
Well, loitering is not legal.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.285
But this is not about
the loitering, right?

10:47.320 --> 10:48.987
This is about you being uncomfortable

10:49.022 --> 10:50.489
with two black women on your block.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.623
Right.

10:51.658 --> 10:53.291
Are you calling me a racist?

10:53.326 --> 10:54.892
Just telling it how I see it.

10:56.996 --> 10:58.596
I'm calling the police.

10:58.631 --> 11:00.531
- The police?
- That is entirely unnecessary.

11:00.566 --> 11:02.299
Call the police?

11:02.334 --> 11:04.768
I think we should go.
I don't think it's worth it.

11:04.804 --> 11:05.970
I'd like to report an incident.

11:06.005 --> 11:07.638
They didn't even do anything.

11:07.673 --> 11:09.106
- We sh...
- This is insane.

11:09.141 --> 11:10.908
We should go. We're leaving, right now.

11:10.943 --> 11:12.476
- We're leaving.
- You're unbelievable.

11:12.512 --> 11:14.277
Guys, we have to leave.

11:16.015 --> 11:17.114
We're going.

11:19.485 --> 11:21.631
- Did that really just happen?
- I can't believe it.

11:21.706 --> 11:23.410
Just because we live
in a privileged bastion

11:23.507 --> 11:24.991
doesn't mean these things don't happen.

11:25.043 --> 11:26.541
I should have prepared you for that.

11:26.577 --> 11:28.077
That's on me.

11:28.112 --> 11:29.945
What do you wanna do?

11:31.215 --> 11:34.716
Uh, make myself not feel
how I feel right now.

11:35.498 --> 11:36.751
Hey, can you record me?

11:36.787 --> 11:39.088
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

11:39.123 --> 11:41.190
Kat that's a bad idea.

11:41.225 --> 11:43.758
How can sharing what just
happened be a bad idea?

11:43.794 --> 11:45.227
It's not normally,

11:45.262 --> 11:46.561
but it's just gonna
throw us off the message.

11:46.597 --> 11:48.530
I feel like it's on message.

11:48.565 --> 11:49.865
It's part of my platform:

11:49.900 --> 11:52.101
social justice, racial equality.

11:54.605 --> 11:55.570
- Ready?
- Kat...

11:55.606 --> 11:56.638
Yeah.

11:57.908 --> 12:00.375
Wish I was bringing you
another light-hearted update,

12:00.410 --> 12:03.378
but today while out canvassing,

12:03.413 --> 12:05.980
my campaign manager and I
were racially profiled

12:06.016 --> 12:07.681
by a white woman.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.684
She said that she didn't think

12:10.720 --> 12:12.286
we belonged in the neighborhood,

12:12.322 --> 12:14.122
and she called the police.

12:14.157 --> 12:16.057
I'm still processing.

12:18.594 --> 12:20.128
Kat, don't post that.

12:20.963 --> 12:22.563
Uh, I already did.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.600
I'm gonna head back to the office

12:26.636 --> 12:29.237
and get back to the campaign.

12:39.314 --> 12:41.348
Hey, did you ever find a place to live?

12:43.118 --> 12:45.152
Yeah, a buddy gave me his
couch for a couple nights,

12:45.187 --> 12:46.620
while I figure out my game plan.

12:47.957 --> 12:49.690
What do you think
about what Sutton said,

12:49.725 --> 12:51.692
about us living together?

12:51.727 --> 12:54.628
I mean, it seems like an easy solution,

12:54.664 --> 12:57.097
but it could also be my worst nightmare.

12:57.132 --> 12:59.332
Living with me would be
your worst nightmare?

12:59.368 --> 13:00.834
I'm a dream roommate.

13:01.871 --> 13:03.103
How do you know I'm not?

13:03.138 --> 13:04.304
How do I know that you are?

13:04.374 --> 13:07.808
Well, we could take a
roommate compatibility quiz.

13:07.843 --> 13:09.509
We've both written them.

13:09.545 --> 13:11.946
Well, I will show you
mine if you show me yours.

13:11.981 --> 13:13.814
Ew. Uh, I can come back.

13:13.849 --> 13:15.182
That came out wrong.

13:15.217 --> 13:16.916
I don't really care either way.

13:16.952 --> 13:18.585
Jane, Jacqueline would like
to see you in her office.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.187
Okay.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.490
Different choice of words next time.

13:26.228 --> 13:28.861
Yeah, well, we are absolutely thrilled

13:28.897 --> 13:32.365
to have Zoe Kravitz on our fall cover.

13:33.702 --> 13:34.968
All right.

13:35.003 --> 13:36.769
Thank you so much. Bye.

13:36.805 --> 13:38.838
You switched the Cammy
shoot to tomorrow?

13:38.873 --> 13:40.607
Well, the product was here,
Cammy was available,

13:40.642 --> 13:42.542
and you and I both need a break
in this Pamela Dolan story.

13:42.578 --> 13:43.876
So get your questions together,

13:43.912 --> 13:45.878
and we will carve out a time to talk.

13:45.914 --> 13:47.380
- Will do.
- Great work, Jane.

14:04.863 --> 14:07.192
_

14:13.908 --> 14:15.241
Hey, did I tell you that

14:15.276 --> 14:17.543
I'm gonna be on a panel in Bangor

14:17.578 --> 14:19.746
that might be moderated by Stephen King?

14:19.781 --> 14:21.715
- That's amazing.
- I know. I know.

14:21.787 --> 14:23.456
Even if it doesn't happen, just the fact

14:23.552 --> 14:26.852
that our names were once
said in the same sentence,

14:26.887 --> 14:29.522
that's enough for me. I can die now.

14:29.557 --> 14:32.191
Well, I interviewed a bunch
of potential roommates

14:32.226 --> 14:35.194
who would be right at home
in a Stephen King novel.

14:36.430 --> 14:38.330
It takes time to find
the perfect person.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.765
Don't rush it.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.235
Actually, um, Alex's place flooded,

14:43.271 --> 14:45.237
and he needs a place to stay,

14:45.273 --> 14:47.640
so maybe he's the perfect roommate?

14:47.675 --> 14:50.075
Mmm, I don't think that's a good idea.

14:50.110 --> 14:52.211
Why, because he's a guy?

14:52.246 --> 14:53.579
No, because you work with him.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.281
Yeah, but I worked with Sutton,

14:55.316 --> 14:56.982
and she was the best roommate.

14:57.017 --> 14:58.250
Well, that was different.

14:58.286 --> 14:59.885
Because he's a guy.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.452
Because she's your best friend.

15:01.488 --> 15:04.956
Okay, well, Alex and I are gonna take

15:04.992 --> 15:07.059
a roommate compatibility quiz.

15:07.094 --> 15:08.794
So we'll see what happens.

15:10.664 --> 15:12.297
What?

15:12.332 --> 15:13.598
You're gonna make this decision

15:13.633 --> 15:15.300
based on a "Scarlet" quiz?

15:15.335 --> 15:17.903
I wrote that "Scarlet" quiz.

15:17.938 --> 15:19.905
Okay.

15:24.845 --> 15:26.144
Hey.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.646
- Hi.
- Hello.

15:28.682 --> 15:30.182
Okay, take care.

15:31.585 --> 15:33.218
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:33.253 --> 15:35.119
I texted you earlier.

15:35.154 --> 15:37.888
Yeah, it's just been nuts around here.

15:37.924 --> 15:39.224
Kat Edison for City Council.

15:39.259 --> 15:40.790
Yeah, let me transfer you.

15:43.362 --> 15:45.429
So, look, I'm thinking about posting

15:45.464 --> 15:48.665
the video you took of that woman.

15:48.701 --> 15:50.334
I took that just for our protection,

15:50.369 --> 15:51.374
not anything else.

15:51.470 --> 15:55.305
Right, but...
I mean, people, they're upset.

15:55.341 --> 15:57.040
They wanna know who she is.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.008
Look, if you post the video,

15:59.044 --> 16:01.945
it's gonna take the focus
off of you and all of this

16:01.980 --> 16:04.147
and make it about that woman.

16:04.182 --> 16:05.515
You don't know that.

16:05.551 --> 16:08.118
Well, this ain't my first rodeo.

16:09.008 --> 16:10.520
Meaning, what?

16:11.228 --> 16:12.723
I'm not giving you the video.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.474
Can you believe she
wouldn't give me the video?

16:23.509 --> 16:25.175
'Cause she knows you wanna post it?

16:25.211 --> 16:27.811
Yeah, she said she thinks it'll shift

16:27.846 --> 16:29.413
the focus away from the campaign.

16:29.448 --> 16:30.947
Well, what do you think?

16:30.983 --> 16:34.017
I think for the first time since we met

16:34.052 --> 16:35.952
that Tia just doesn't get me.

16:35.988 --> 16:37.454
I mean, she said that she loved

16:37.490 --> 16:38.955
that I had a background in social media

16:38.991 --> 16:40.991
and now she doesn't
even want me to use it.

16:41.026 --> 16:42.075
And...

16:42.694 --> 16:44.794
_

16:44.863 --> 16:47.431
Well, maybe you should just
table the video for now

16:47.466 --> 16:49.366
and connect with her.

16:49.401 --> 16:51.001
Yeah, maybe.

16:51.036 --> 16:52.669
What's going on with you guys?

16:52.704 --> 16:54.371
We're good.

16:54.406 --> 16:55.606
Nothing new.

16:56.609 --> 16:57.974
Just white people problems.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.343
Oh, well, then I'm half-interested.

17:00.879 --> 17:03.346
Okay, well, Alex and I are taking

17:03.381 --> 17:05.181
a roommate compatibility quiz.

17:05.215 --> 17:07.083
- The same one I failed?
- Uh, yes.

17:07.118 --> 17:08.384
So you're considering Alex?

17:08.419 --> 17:09.886
I was.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.755
But Ryan doesn't seem okay with it.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.023
Oh. Do we think he's jealous?

17:15.260 --> 17:16.760
Unclear.

17:16.795 --> 17:18.327
So much fun, right, trying to figure out

17:18.363 --> 17:20.096
what's going on inside
of your boyfriend's head?

17:20.132 --> 17:20.865
Yeah.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.684
Richard's still running
like Forrest Gump?

17:22.701 --> 17:25.026
Indeed. I don't know
what's going on with him lately,

17:25.069 --> 17:27.837
but he's so tightly wound.

17:27.873 --> 17:30.674
Maybe he just needs
to have a little fun.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.742
Yeah, you are throwing him
a party, right?

17:32.778 --> 17:34.711
Yeah, maybe I should
make it bigger, you know?

17:34.746 --> 17:37.180
Perhaps, give it a theme like running?

17:38.784 --> 17:40.549
- No.
- I'm not gonna do that.

17:40.584 --> 17:42.718
But I could invite the
guys that he runs with.

17:42.753 --> 17:44.086
One of them works for Porch & Garden,

17:44.121 --> 17:45.587
and I think his name's Dominick.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.692
Yeah, I'm gonna give Richard
the best party he's ever had.

17:49.727 --> 17:51.259
Yeah. What about you?

17:51.295 --> 17:52.661
How are you gonna fix
things with Pinstripe?

17:53.764 --> 17:55.097
Sex.

17:56.266 --> 17:58.466
Hey, Dominick,
this is Richard Hunter's girlfriend,

17:58.502 --> 18:00.602
Sutton Brady.

18:00.637 --> 18:01.664
Hi.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.538
I'm good, thank you.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.245
Hmm.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.880
You are a morning person.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.248
So are you.

18:13.283 --> 18:15.050
Oh, and you hate
dishes left in the sink.

18:15.086 --> 18:16.384
I loathe.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.886
Oh, you don't snore. That's good.

18:18.922 --> 18:20.888
- Neither do you.
- Yeah, Sutton did.

18:20.924 --> 18:21.989
Oh, that must have sucked.

18:22.025 --> 18:24.125
It did, wasn't great.

18:24.752 --> 18:26.427
You love long showers.

18:26.462 --> 18:28.395
Oh, you like to conserve water.

18:29.146 --> 18:30.531
Ooh, but you're a minimalist.

18:30.566 --> 18:31.799
Well, I am now.

18:31.835 --> 18:33.567
Just a backpack and a gaming machine.

18:33.603 --> 18:35.036
You know what?

18:35.071 --> 18:37.404
This is stupid, just stay with me

18:37.440 --> 18:38.773
until your apartment's ready.

18:38.808 --> 18:40.241
Are you sure that's a good idea?

18:40.276 --> 18:42.977
Uh, yeah. And if it's not,
then you can just go back

18:43.012 --> 18:44.265
to staying on your friend's couch.

18:44.281 --> 18:47.548
But right now, my best option
is a girl and her lizard.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.618
Also, I could really use the rent money.

18:50.653 --> 18:51.985
I could use a bed.

18:52.020 --> 18:53.721
I have one of those.

18:53.756 --> 18:55.256
Oh, but I forgot to mention...

18:55.291 --> 18:56.490
It's in the living room. Sutton told me.

18:56.525 --> 18:57.958
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

18:59.295 --> 19:01.662
Okay, so we good?

19:01.697 --> 19:03.430
We're good.

19:03.466 --> 19:05.031
Great.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.268
I'll get you a key.

19:07.824 --> 19:09.102
Thanks.

19:14.510 --> 19:16.343
<i>It's Ryan. If you still leave messages,</i>

19:16.379 --> 19:18.111
<i>go ahead and leave one.</i>

19:18.147 --> 19:21.315
Hey, Ryan, um...

19:21.350 --> 19:23.984
just give me a call when you get this.

19:24.019 --> 19:26.286
All right. Bye.

19:34.462 --> 19:35.828
Hey. My turn.

19:35.863 --> 19:36.872
No foam latte.

19:36.898 --> 19:38.030
Thanks. Everything okay?

19:38.065 --> 19:39.365
I got a meeting in ten minutes.

19:39.401 --> 19:40.667
I'm not sure everything's okay.

19:40.702 --> 19:42.268
Hey... hey. Whoa.

19:42.304 --> 19:44.203
I spoke with Dominick
from Porch & Garden

19:44.238 --> 19:45.471
who you run with.

19:45.507 --> 19:46.516
I don't run with him anymore.

19:46.541 --> 19:48.174
Yeah, that's what he said.

19:48.209 --> 19:49.809
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

19:49.844 --> 19:51.444
Yeah, I just got sick
of running the same path

19:51.479 --> 19:53.846
over and over again,
so I started doing my own thing.

19:53.881 --> 19:55.147
Cool, so you still like those guys?

19:55.183 --> 19:56.649
- Yeah.
- Great.

19:56.685 --> 19:57.812
I invited them to your party

19:57.886 --> 19:59.378
and also some of your
friends from college.

19:59.420 --> 20:00.704
I thought we were only
having ten people?

20:00.788 --> 20:03.555
It's gonna be like 20, 25 tops.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.025
Why would you do that?

20:07.461 --> 20:08.694
It's your birthday.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.230
I don't wanna have a party, Sutton.

20:11.265 --> 20:13.299
- At all?
- At all.

20:15.136 --> 20:16.368
But I invited everybody.

20:16.403 --> 20:18.037
So disinvite them.

20:18.072 --> 20:20.072
They're my friends, they'll understand.

20:25.947 --> 20:27.646
And that's the last of
the thank-you post cards.

20:27.681 --> 20:28.747
Great. Okay.

20:28.782 --> 20:30.582
Extra pickles for you.

20:31.719 --> 20:33.117
No onions for me.

20:40.427 --> 20:42.761
So I missed seeing you last night.

20:42.796 --> 20:44.663
Yeah.

20:44.698 --> 20:46.398
You too.

20:47.601 --> 20:49.568
I'm really sorry that
I didn't listen to you

20:49.603 --> 20:51.236
the other day when
we were out canvassing.

20:51.271 --> 20:53.037
You clearly wanted us to split up,

20:53.073 --> 20:57.275
and I just wanted
to spend time with you.

20:57.310 --> 20:58.977
I wasn't thinking about
the fact that we were

20:59.012 --> 21:01.079
two black women canvassing alone...

21:01.114 --> 21:02.614
Yeah.

21:02.649 --> 21:04.916
And I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

21:04.951 --> 21:06.784
It's not your fault.

21:06.819 --> 21:08.887
I know, but it's the first time
it happened to you;

21:08.922 --> 21:11.422
that's scary...

21:11.457 --> 21:13.624
I just wish I could say
it will never happen again.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.527
Well, I wanna make sure it doesn't.

21:18.098 --> 21:20.298
I wanna tackle racial profiling.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.342
That's great.

21:21.368 --> 21:23.001
Yeah, and once you're elected,

21:23.036 --> 21:25.103
we'll have the vantage point
to make the moves that...

21:26.039 --> 21:27.671
What... what's up?

21:29.842 --> 21:33.711
I just feel like we
can do something now.

21:33.746 --> 21:35.713
You know?

21:35.748 --> 21:37.481
If we post that video to social media,

21:37.517 --> 21:38.749
we can take back some of the power

21:38.785 --> 21:40.817
that was taken from us.

21:40.852 --> 21:43.520
You're seriously still
talking about the video?

21:44.589 --> 21:46.890
I can't just sit back and like,
have a normal day

21:46.926 --> 21:48.050
like nothing happened.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.559
Well, just because
I have a different approach,

21:49.594 --> 21:51.128
doesn't mean I'm sitting back.

21:52.431 --> 21:55.665
Politics create change that lasts.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.834
Yeah, I agree. That's why I'm running.

21:57.869 --> 21:59.636
But social media can be a part of that.

22:04.343 --> 22:06.375
Okay.

22:06.411 --> 22:08.945
I really... I can't explain it
any clearer than I have, so...

22:08.980 --> 22:10.547
It's your campaign.

22:10.582 --> 22:13.049
If you want to post
the video and derail it,

22:13.084 --> 22:15.985
that is, uh, your prerogative.

22:19.023 --> 22:20.957
Do you want your sandwich?

22:20.992 --> 22:22.826
I was just gonna get it actually.

22:22.861 --> 22:23.993
Yes, thank you.

22:24.028 --> 22:26.563
Okay, well...

22:39.430 --> 22:41.608
Cammy. Hi.

22:41.643 --> 22:43.976
Jacqueline Carlyle. I'm a big fan.

22:44.012 --> 22:45.021
Oh, thank you.

22:45.046 --> 22:46.445
This is Jane Sloan,

22:46.480 --> 22:48.281
one of our top writers at "Scarlet."

22:48.316 --> 22:50.482
I'm presently trying to steal
her back from the dot com.

22:50.518 --> 22:52.985
I saw that you worked for Pamela Dolan

22:53.021 --> 22:54.788
- as her assistant.
- Yeah.

22:54.861 --> 22:57.356
Now I work with makeup
products instead of models.

22:57.391 --> 22:59.325
It's a little less complicated.

22:59.925 --> 23:02.661
Well, we're actually writing a story

23:02.697 --> 23:05.564
about how she treated her models.

23:05.599 --> 23:07.499
And so far nobody will
go on the record for us.

23:07.535 --> 23:10.036
I'm one of a few assistants
who stayed in the business.

23:10.071 --> 23:11.470
I'd like to keep it that way.

23:11.505 --> 23:13.873
Oh, yeah. No, of course.

23:13.908 --> 23:16.142
Totally understand that.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.877
I'm sorry she's still doing it.

23:21.049 --> 23:24.015
What exactly is she doing?

23:25.785 --> 23:27.552
Off the record?

23:27.587 --> 23:29.420
Yes, off the record.

23:31.091 --> 23:35.327
She abuses young,
beautiful, naive women.

23:35.906 --> 23:38.363
She breaks them down emotionally,

23:38.398 --> 23:41.699
psychologically, sometimes physically.

23:41.735 --> 23:43.869
I think she gets off on humiliating them

23:43.904 --> 23:45.636
and having power over them.

23:45.672 --> 23:47.538
No one says anything?

23:47.574 --> 23:50.541
Not when the result leads to raw,
powerful photographs.

23:50.577 --> 23:53.411
Look, whatever she's doing
works on the page.

23:53.446 --> 23:55.713
No one wants to mess with that.

23:55.749 --> 23:58.516
Honestly, half my job was
carrying camera equipment.

23:58.551 --> 24:00.852
The other half was handing out NDAs.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.187
Nondisclosure agreements?

24:02.222 --> 24:03.554
Yeah.

24:03.569 --> 24:06.391
Would there be any chance
that you remember the models?

24:06.426 --> 24:08.559
I do, but I don't feel comfortable

24:08.595 --> 24:09.894
giving you their information.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.962
Well, what about if we found the models

24:11.998 --> 24:13.197
and then brought you their names,

24:13.232 --> 24:15.466
would you be willing to confirm

24:15.502 --> 24:17.769
that you did in fact
have them sign the NDAs?

24:20.139 --> 24:21.572
Sure.

24:24.411 --> 24:25.810
Sutton.

24:25.863 --> 24:28.479
Oliver said you have an update
for me on our fairytale spread?

24:28.515 --> 24:30.548
Oh, yes. I do.

24:30.583 --> 24:33.451
Everything is organized by
story in the fashion closet.

24:33.486 --> 24:34.919
And we are waiting to confirm

24:34.954 --> 24:36.720
this incredible red Dior sweater.

24:36.723 --> 24:39.023
But everything else is on schedule,

24:39.058 --> 24:40.124
and it's gonna be magical.

24:40.159 --> 24:42.092
I'm counting on it.

24:42.128 --> 24:44.594
Oh, I saw your email

24:44.630 --> 24:46.563
that Richard's party has been canceled.

24:46.598 --> 24:48.098
That's disappointing. Ian and I

24:48.134 --> 24:49.222
were really looking forward to that.

24:49.268 --> 24:50.935
Yeah, me too.

24:50.970 --> 24:52.269
Is everything okay?

24:53.316 --> 24:56.373
Richard doesn't want a party. So...

24:56.409 --> 24:58.108
You know, he said it's not a big deal.

24:58.144 --> 25:00.811
So I guess it's not.

25:02.648 --> 25:05.615
Hmm. But you think it is?

25:05.651 --> 25:08.385
I think he's off, in general.

25:09.788 --> 25:11.922
Birthdays can bring up a lot of stuff.

25:11.957 --> 25:13.790
Yeah, and he did just lose his father.

25:13.826 --> 25:15.325
Yeah.

25:16.695 --> 25:19.028
And he never talks about it.

25:19.064 --> 25:20.797
He went from the funeral to Paris

25:20.833 --> 25:21.965
and then right back to work.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.334
I don't know, I just...

25:24.369 --> 25:26.002
Yeah.

25:27.405 --> 25:31.341
You know, my... my son, Connor,

25:31.376 --> 25:34.310
he's not very talkative.

25:34.346 --> 25:37.781
And it's always been hard to find
an access point into him.

25:37.816 --> 25:41.017
But he loves to go to the batting cages.

25:41.052 --> 25:43.820
And so a few years ago,
I started to go with him.

25:43.856 --> 25:46.622
And um... I don't know,

25:46.657 --> 25:49.024
somehow it just...

25:49.059 --> 25:51.193
has helped him open up.

25:51.228 --> 25:55.364
I guess because... I met him halfway.

26:00.037 --> 26:03.205
Anyway, I look forward
to seeing that Dior sweater.

26:08.846 --> 26:10.445
- Intense, right?
<i>- Are you calling me a racist?</i>

26:10.481 --> 26:11.881
It's terrible.

26:11.916 --> 26:14.717
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

26:14.752 --> 26:16.756
- People have to see this.
- I agree.

26:16.787 --> 26:19.087
I think that this is an
opportunity to shed light

26:19.123 --> 26:21.689
on how events like this
affect people of color.

26:21.725 --> 26:23.915
Oh, yes. Of course. People like this
must be held accountable.

26:23.961 --> 26:25.260
Who is she?

26:25.295 --> 26:26.528
I... I don't know.

26:26.563 --> 26:27.996
Well, we'll find out. We can call her,

26:28.032 --> 26:30.399
uh, "Canvassing Cathy"

26:30.434 --> 26:32.734
or "Racist Rachel."

26:32.769 --> 26:34.236
She better have a name we can work with.

26:34.271 --> 26:36.938
But that's not really
the focus of the video, you know?

26:36.973 --> 26:38.706
The video is about raising awareness.

26:38.742 --> 26:40.675
People are going to be very aware

26:40.710 --> 26:42.244
of who this woman is.

26:43.013 --> 26:44.579
Post the video, Kat.

26:55.891 --> 26:59.726
Okay. Do you wanna do the honors?

26:59.762 --> 27:01.662
What is that?

27:01.697 --> 27:03.397
Pink's not your color?

27:03.433 --> 27:05.732
Fine, I'll open it. Okay.

27:12.241 --> 27:13.740
Oh, my God. It smells amazing.

27:13.776 --> 27:15.142
Yeah, it does.

27:25.076 --> 27:26.352
Ryan.

27:28.256 --> 27:30.090
You made me dinner?

27:31.359 --> 27:34.294
Surprise. What's up, Alex?

27:34.329 --> 27:35.928
Hey, Ryan.

27:40.168 --> 27:42.502
I'm just gonna close this.

27:45.307 --> 27:47.707
Give you two a little space.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.355
This is beautiful.

28:04.859 --> 28:06.125
A heads-up would have been nice.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.060
I called and left a message.

28:08.096 --> 28:09.328
A message which said nothing

28:09.363 --> 28:10.930
about Alex being your new roommate.

28:10.965 --> 28:12.564
That's why I asked you to call me back.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.168
Well, I'm sorry. I was busy
preparing all of this for you.

28:16.203 --> 28:19.371
For us, because we only have
two nights left together.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.972
And that's why I wanted to get

28:21.008 --> 28:22.373
this whole roommate
thing out of the way,

28:22.408 --> 28:24.142
so that we could focus on each other.

28:24.177 --> 28:26.310
Even though I said that I didn't think
Alex was a good idea.

28:29.382 --> 28:31.816
Look, I mean, Ryan...

28:31.852 --> 28:33.985
I don't understand what the big deal is.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.891
- I should go pack.
- Ryan, come on.

28:50.612 --> 28:53.213
Hey. Where you going?

28:53.248 --> 28:54.748
This is the new path.

28:54.783 --> 28:56.883
- I told you.
- Really?

28:56.918 --> 28:58.517
Hey, Sutton, come on.
We gotta keep it going.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.319
Why'd you change the route?
I love this route.

29:00.355 --> 29:01.387
I told you, I got bored.

29:01.422 --> 29:02.856
Let's go. Come on.

29:07.462 --> 29:08.895
No, wait.

29:10.265 --> 29:11.664
The duck pond is this way.

29:11.699 --> 29:13.266
Yeah, so?

29:13.301 --> 29:15.501
The duck pond...
the duck pond that your dad

29:15.536 --> 29:17.103
used to take you to
when you were a kid, right?

29:17.139 --> 29:18.905
- Am I making that up?
- No.

29:18.940 --> 29:20.940
No, you're not making it up,
but remember when you said

29:20.976 --> 29:24.076
you wanted to run with me?
Well, right now, we're not running.

29:24.111 --> 29:25.577
Let's go.

29:25.612 --> 29:27.445
That's why you don't run
with the guys anymore.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.447
You think I stopped running with them

29:29.483 --> 29:31.917
because of a duck pond
my dad used to take me to?

29:33.687 --> 29:35.620
Yeah.

29:37.992 --> 29:40.625
Okay, well, what if I did?

29:40.661 --> 29:43.996
Is it wrong to not wanna see that?

29:44.031 --> 29:45.397
It's not about the pond.

29:45.432 --> 29:49.034
It's about what the pond represents.

29:49.069 --> 29:51.703
Richard...

29:51.738 --> 29:53.738
You can't run from your dad forever.

29:53.774 --> 29:55.040
I'm not.

29:55.075 --> 29:56.842
You literally are.

29:58.412 --> 30:01.313
Ever since he passed away,

30:01.348 --> 30:03.214
you don't talk about him.

30:03.249 --> 30:05.917
If his name comes up in conversation,

30:05.952 --> 30:08.753
you change the subject.

30:08.789 --> 30:10.922
You haven't been home
to visit your family.

30:10.957 --> 30:13.991
We all process things
in our own way, Sutton.

30:14.027 --> 30:17.395
Of course. Of course.

30:17.431 --> 30:20.965
But are you processing it?

30:29.079 --> 30:30.375
Morning, Janey-poo.

30:30.410 --> 30:32.510
Oh, please don't say that.

30:32.546 --> 30:34.813
Can I interest you in some coffee?

30:34.848 --> 30:37.515
Uh, yeah. That sounds great.

30:39.352 --> 30:42.019
Jamaican Blue Mountain.

30:43.689 --> 30:45.489
I grind it myself.

30:45.917 --> 30:47.859
Oh, I...

30:47.894 --> 30:49.760
Trust me.

30:57.036 --> 30:59.603
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

30:59.638 --> 31:00.888
So let me get this straight.

31:00.941 --> 31:03.841
You couldn't save your clothes,
but you could save

31:03.877 --> 31:06.143
your French Press and
your gaming system?

31:06.179 --> 31:07.845
- Priorities.
- Hmm.

31:07.881 --> 31:09.780
The French Press is waterproof,

31:09.815 --> 31:12.350
and the gaming system is awesome.

31:12.944 --> 31:14.085
Touché.

31:15.921 --> 31:18.655
Hey, I know it's none of my business...

31:20.092 --> 31:23.159
but Ryan seemed pretty
pissed off last night.

31:23.195 --> 31:25.228
I know.

31:25.264 --> 31:28.231
I... I've never seen him like that.

31:28.267 --> 31:31.535
And I don't get it.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.738
I mean, he knows that I need a roommate.

31:34.774 --> 31:36.774
Well, maybe he thought you
were gonna ask him to move in?

31:37.934 --> 31:40.076
No. That's crazy.

31:40.112 --> 31:42.946
It's too early in our
relationship for that.

31:42.981 --> 31:44.281
It kinda feels like you guys

31:44.316 --> 31:46.349
are unofficially living together.

31:46.385 --> 31:48.351
His toothbrush is here.

31:48.387 --> 31:50.454
His hockey stuff is right there.

31:51.753 --> 31:54.056
Just because you think
it's too early to move in

31:54.091 --> 31:56.058
doesn't mean he does.

32:05.036 --> 32:06.402
You got "Forza" on that thing?

32:07.015 --> 32:08.270
- Yeah.
- Do you think

32:08.306 --> 32:11.040
we have time to fit in
a game before work?

32:11.075 --> 32:12.608
Wait, you're telling me
you play "Forza"?

32:14.646 --> 32:15.683
You have a lot to learn.

32:15.747 --> 32:18.748
I grew up with three brothers.
I will crush you.

32:23.822 --> 32:25.855
Got you a...

32:37.367 --> 32:39.100
I didn't see the video.

32:39.135 --> 32:41.302
Yeah, because I decided not to post it.

32:44.942 --> 32:46.407
You were right.

32:46.443 --> 32:48.677
It would have taken us off message.

32:48.712 --> 32:50.612
I didn't see it at first,

32:50.647 --> 32:53.582
but I, um...

32:53.617 --> 32:54.983
I showed the video to my boss,

32:55.018 --> 32:59.387
and... it just became crystal clear.

33:04.594 --> 33:06.627
You know,
I used to be really impulsive...

33:07.964 --> 33:10.798
More impulsive.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.734
Like, if someone said anything
about me or my friends,

33:13.769 --> 33:17.738
I was so ready to just fight.

33:17.773 --> 33:20.975
And it was naive,
and it got me arrested,

33:21.011 --> 33:25.279
but, I don't know,
it also felt really good

33:25.315 --> 33:27.281
to use my power.

33:32.154 --> 33:33.887
It just didn't create change.

33:37.326 --> 33:39.326
No, it didn't.

33:39.361 --> 33:40.693
Wow, so it must have been hard for you

33:40.729 --> 33:41.995
not to fight that woman?

33:42.442 --> 33:44.364
You have no idea.

33:45.767 --> 33:47.567
So you turn to social media.
It makes sense.

33:47.602 --> 33:49.836
That's your place of power.

33:49.871 --> 33:51.371
I guess.

33:54.443 --> 33:56.976
I guess I'm kind of a late bloomer

33:57.012 --> 34:01.281
when it comes to like,
identity and race stuff.

34:01.316 --> 34:02.449
Oh, yeah, me too.

34:02.484 --> 34:05.384
I mean...

34:05.420 --> 34:08.487
it took me till now...

34:08.523 --> 34:12.058
to embrace a desire that
I've had my entire life.

34:13.928 --> 34:16.161
Black and gay.

34:16.197 --> 34:18.964
The one-two punch.

34:18.998 --> 34:22.301
So, you know,
we just have to be smarter,

34:22.335 --> 34:25.603
stronger, more strategic.

34:27.074 --> 34:31.110
I love that you love social media.

34:31.145 --> 34:34.547
But maybe we can use it in a way
that works for both of us.

34:34.581 --> 34:36.181
What you thinking?

34:44.891 --> 34:47.893
I didn't expect to miss him this much.

34:47.928 --> 34:50.629
We never really got along.

34:50.664 --> 34:53.799
It doesn't matter. He was your dad.

34:56.770 --> 34:58.770
The first time he
brought me to this pond,

34:58.806 --> 35:00.706
it was my birthday, and he bought me

35:00.741 --> 35:03.308
a little motorized yacht.

35:05.044 --> 35:07.145
Oh, of course it was a yacht.

35:10.450 --> 35:13.050
We spent hours zipping
it around the pond.

35:13.086 --> 35:16.221
I'm pretty sure we stayed
until the batteries ran out.

35:18.558 --> 35:20.057
He never made much time for me,

35:20.093 --> 35:21.993
but on my birthday,
he always found some.

35:24.231 --> 35:27.332
Having this first one without him...

35:30.837 --> 35:33.471
I guess it just brought up stuff.

35:33.507 --> 35:34.972
Yeah.

35:39.945 --> 35:42.146
What about your dad? Tell me about him.

35:45.451 --> 35:47.151
I don't know him.

35:48.787 --> 35:50.621
He and my mom broke up when I was a baby

35:50.656 --> 35:52.689
and he took off.

35:56.395 --> 35:58.094
I met him once.

35:58.130 --> 36:01.931
I was 12. He was really nice.

36:01.967 --> 36:03.567
So funny.

36:03.602 --> 36:05.135
Hmm. So that's where you get it?

36:09.208 --> 36:12.275
He wrote me a couple of
times when I was a kid,

36:12.310 --> 36:15.344
said that he would come
back when I turn 13.

36:17.816 --> 36:18.848
He didn't.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.254
It was hard to get over,

36:25.290 --> 36:27.557
to get through.

36:29.294 --> 36:32.662
But I did, eventually.

36:54.969 --> 36:56.402
Are you off coffee?

36:56.437 --> 36:58.271
Oh, no.

36:58.827 --> 37:01.540
Alex made this really
incredible Jamaican blend.

37:01.576 --> 37:02.875
Of course he did.

37:02.910 --> 37:05.278
Are you seriously jealous of Alex?

37:05.313 --> 37:08.113
I'm jealous that he gets
to see you every morning.

37:08.149 --> 37:10.182
So when you were saying
that I would find

37:10.217 --> 37:12.518
the perfect roommate, eventually,

37:12.553 --> 37:15.788
was that because you wanted
me to ask you to move in?

37:15.823 --> 37:17.556
Maybe?

37:17.592 --> 37:20.092
- I know it's really early.
- Yeah, it's definitely early.

37:22.597 --> 37:26.499
But I think that I chose Alex
because he's temporary.

37:28.836 --> 37:32.637
I kind of wanted to keep
that door open for us.

37:32.673 --> 37:35.407
But I think I only just realized that.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.609
- You thought about it.
- Subconsciously.

37:37.644 --> 37:39.110
Yeah, but you still thought about it.

37:42.349 --> 37:45.983
I think I was also using sex to avoid

37:46.019 --> 37:48.119
thinking about how much
I'm going to miss you.

37:48.154 --> 37:50.388
Well, I love your avoidance tactics.

37:55.796 --> 37:57.995
So eight weeks, huh?

37:58.031 --> 37:59.464
8 1/2, actually.

37:59.499 --> 38:01.433
They added a couple of
college campus visits.

38:01.873 --> 38:04.502
Your book's becoming a big deal.

38:05.178 --> 38:06.504
Yeah, I guess it is.

38:09.642 --> 38:12.243
Okay, so how about we

38:12.278 --> 38:14.745
get a hotel for our last night together?

38:14.780 --> 38:16.814
That sounds perfect.

38:23.957 --> 38:25.356
Do you need to respond to that?

38:25.391 --> 38:27.158
I do. I'm so sorry.

38:27.193 --> 38:29.227
It'll just take a second.

38:29.330 --> 38:31.330
_

38:32.866 --> 38:34.531
Oh.

38:34.567 --> 38:35.833
It's my editor.

38:37.172 --> 38:38.178
Hey.

38:48.713 --> 38:50.446
- Okay, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

38:51.549 --> 38:55.485
So, many of you who saw
my post asked for a face,

38:55.520 --> 38:58.889
a name, someone to represent
the change that we all need

38:58.924 --> 39:01.858
to see when it comes to inequality.

39:01.894 --> 39:05.228
The name you need to know is Kat Edison,

39:05.264 --> 39:08.198
candidate for City Council
in the First District.

39:08.233 --> 39:11.968
I wanna represent you
no matter who you are,

39:12.004 --> 39:15.138
who you love, or what you look like,

39:15.173 --> 39:17.473
because that's something
that we all deserve.

39:20.879 --> 39:23.479
- It's perfect.
- Thanks.

39:23.515 --> 39:25.681
So now what?

39:28.586 --> 39:31.253
Now I kiss you.

39:35.226 --> 39:36.692
Dinner was perfect. Thank you.

39:36.728 --> 39:38.994
It was, wasn't it?

39:39.030 --> 39:42.097
Wow.

39:42.133 --> 39:45.367
Well, apparently
I forgot to cancel the cake.

39:45.403 --> 39:47.236
So...

39:47.271 --> 39:51.040
Oh, my God. How are we gonna
eat a 25-person cake?

39:51.075 --> 39:52.374
How about we invite all
of those people over

39:52.410 --> 39:53.876
- to help us eat it?
- "Those people"...

39:53.912 --> 39:55.601
the people that I invited
to your birthday party?

39:55.679 --> 40:00.048
Yeah, why not? I'll even blow out
some candles if we have some.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.282
Are you sure?

40:01.318 --> 40:04.118
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.922
This is turning out to be
a pretty great birthday.

40:06.957 --> 40:08.924
The first of many that
I get to spend with you,

40:08.959 --> 40:11.125
and I think that's reason to celebrate.

40:12.128 --> 40:14.763
I love that you wanna
celebrate with your friends.

40:14.798 --> 40:15.931
There's just one problem.

40:15.966 --> 40:17.165
What's that?

40:18.469 --> 40:20.034
I haven't seen you in
your birthday suit yet.

40:20.533 --> 40:21.703
My very best suit.

40:21.738 --> 40:22.871
My favorite suit.

40:22.906 --> 40:24.372
- Good point.
- Yeah.

40:24.407 --> 40:25.707
Maybe we should do that first?

40:25.742 --> 40:26.908
I think we probably should.

40:26.944 --> 40:28.609
Mm-hmm.

40:58.508 --> 41:00.674
Are you okay?

41:00.710 --> 41:02.609
I wanna be with you.

41:03.267 --> 41:04.911
I wanna be with you too.
