00:59.961 --> 01:03.756
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:04.174 --> 01:07.427
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:07.427 --> 01:09.762
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.472 --> 01:12.515
will be the leap home.

01:14.893 --> 01:16.936
Gordon? Gordon?

01:17.854 --> 01:20.940
Gordon, will you listen to me?
Are you there, Gordon?

01:20.940 --> 01:23.818
Listen, pick up and phone
and talk to me right now.

01:23.818 --> 01:26.446
Please! Help! Help!
Come and help me, please!

01:26.446 --> 01:28.490
Please! I'm being kidnapped!

01:29.407 --> 01:32.160
He's my ex-husband.
He's gonna kill me!

01:32.160 --> 01:33.953
Please! Please!

01:33.953 --> 01:35.997
What are you doing to her?

01:36.915 --> 01:38.958
Oh, boy.

02:53.282 --> 02:55.410
She's being kidnapped.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.662
Do you think there's a reward
out for her?

02:57.996 --> 03:00.039
There should be.
What he done to me -

03:00.331 --> 03:02.959
She's not in any danger
and I'm not a criminal.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.085
Oh!

03:04.085 --> 03:05.628
Will you let me go?

03:05.628 --> 03:07.964
No! He'll kill me!
I'm not gonna kill you.

03:07.964 --> 03:10.216
He's been threatening me for years.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.802
When he wasn't trying to beat me.

03:14.637 --> 03:20.143
I don't know what I would have done
if you two handsome gentlemen hadn't
come along and rescued me.

03:21.436 --> 03:22.895
Thank you, ma'am.

03:22.895 --> 03:24.397
Look, I'm sure...

03:25.523 --> 03:27.900
I'm sure that there's been some
mistake.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.944
Pipe down, wife beater!

03:30.737 --> 03:32.280
I'll get the sheriff.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.532
Oh, no. I don't want to cause any
trouble.

03:35.324 --> 03:37.493
If you'd just be so kind

03:37.493 --> 03:40.121
as to reach into that pocket
and grab that key.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.290
No, not that one, the other one.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.751
What's this?
Oh, please, just get the key.

03:44.751 --> 03:47.086
It's an arrest warrant.
That's phoney.

03:47.086 --> 03:48.796
Who's it for?
It's for her.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.506
I'm telling you, it's fake!

03:50.506 --> 03:53.176
It says here you're wanted
in Arkansas for -

03:53.176 --> 03:55.428
Embezzlement?
 She's a crook.

03:56.053 --> 03:57.180
What do you know?

03:59.932 --> 04:03.227
That makes you one of them uh...
what do you call it, uh...

04:03.227 --> 04:05.271
Uh...law...
Uh...

04:08.191 --> 04:09.942
Bounty hunter.

04:09.942 --> 04:12.195
Did you grow up around
a nuclear reactor?

04:13.696 --> 04:15.823
I guess you gentlemen can let me go.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.867
We're real sorry, mister.

04:19.619 --> 04:21.745
You're going to jail, little lady.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.831
That's what you think.
Come on, Bill.

04:30.505 --> 04:32.423
Will you cut it out?

04:32.423 --> 04:35.885
Would you please get on the phone?
This is Sheriff Michaels.

04:35.885 --> 04:37.845
Gordon, will you listen to me?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.347
Gordon?

04:39.347 --> 04:41.390
Yeah? Operator?

04:42.058 --> 04:45.144
It's not the doggone operator.
It's Sheriff Michaels.

04:46.270 --> 04:48.105
You've had me worried, boy.

04:48.105 --> 04:50.399
Tell him we'll meet him
at the station.

04:50.399 --> 04:52.360
I'll meet you at the bus station.

04:53.486 --> 04:55.446
Which one?

04:55.446 --> 04:57.490
The Decatur bus station.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.617
Look, are you sure you're OK?

04:59.617 --> 05:01.327
I can call the local sheriff.

05:01.327 --> 05:03.454
No, no, I'm fine.

05:03.454 --> 05:05.540
OK. Decatur bus station.

05:05.998 --> 05:07.875
We'll be there.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.335
Not according to Ziggy.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.422
Pretend you're still talking
on the phone.

05:13.422 --> 05:16.676
Arh! This is terrible.
I've been beat up, kicked -

05:16.676 --> 05:18.719
Wimp.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.932
What am I doing here?

05:23.391 --> 05:26.185
You're Gordon O'Reilly,
bounty hun...

05:26.185 --> 05:28.229
bo-hunt - hunt...
bounty hunter.

05:28.229 --> 05:30.022
Oh, you're a bounty hunter.

05:30.022 --> 05:32.441
I know.
And that's Diane Frost, who -

05:32.441 --> 05:34.485
Come on, hurry up. My feet hurt.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.114
Caramba.

05:38.281 --> 05:39.448
What?

05:39.448 --> 05:42.243
She looks exactly like Maxine.

05:42.243 --> 05:45.538
My fifth...yeah, fifth wife.

05:45.538 --> 05:47.707
Did I ever tell you how I met her?

05:47.707 --> 05:50.084
It was in a tattoo parlour
in Jersey City.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.044
She was getting a -
Al...Al!

05:52.044 --> 05:54.088
Oh, sorry.

05:54.797 --> 05:56.507
I don't believe this.
What?

05:56.507 --> 06:00.553
This Diane was arrested for forging
her boss's name

06:00.553 --> 06:02.847
to a million bucks' worth of
cheques.

06:02.847 --> 06:05.516
She jumped bail and went on the lam
for four days.

06:05.683 --> 06:07.727
She looks so innocent.

06:08.894 --> 06:11.647
And you're the third bounty hunter
on this case.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.816
What happened to the other two?

06:13.816 --> 06:17.862
The first one's got a dislocated
shoulder from...falling off a cliff.

06:19.113 --> 06:22.992
And the other one is in the Fort
Worth General Hospital, in a body
cast.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.661
Accidents happen.

06:26.203 --> 06:28.414
Doesn't sound like an accident to me.

06:28.414 --> 06:31.208
The good news is, both of them heal
their wounds,

06:31.208 --> 06:33.502
and they go on to lead an almost
full life.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.422
Almost?

06:36.422 --> 06:40.593
Yeah. And your job is to make sure
that she doesn't escape.
So far, so good.

06:40.593 --> 06:42.636
Al, this is a very dangerous woman.

06:43.763 --> 06:46.098
What, this dainty little thing here?

06:47.892 --> 06:49.977
Oh, you can handle her.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.730
Hurry up. The sun is giving me
liver spots.

06:52.730 --> 06:55.566
As soon as Ziggy gets more down
on Maxine,

06:55.566 --> 06:57.651
I mean...Diane,

06:57.651 --> 06:59.737
erm...I'll be back.

06:59.737 --> 07:02.323
In the meantime, get her on the bus
to Decatur.

07:21.342 --> 07:23.385
Hi, ma'am.

07:24.386 --> 07:26.430
Not so fast.

07:26.972 --> 07:30.768
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, ma'am.
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

07:30.768 --> 07:32.728
What are you doing?

07:32.728 --> 07:36.690
Hey, bud. Couldn't help but notice
that trouble follows you around,

07:36.690 --> 07:38.234
over there and now here.

07:38.234 --> 07:40.319
You're telling me.

07:40.319 --> 07:43.572
If there's any commotion,
I'll throw you off, you got it?

07:43.572 --> 07:44.698
Yes, sir.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.576
Don't worry, sir. I won't give him
any more trouble.

07:51.455 --> 07:53.499
Thank you.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.126
I'm sorry.

07:56.126 --> 07:58.170
I've behaved badly.

07:59.129 --> 08:01.173
I guess I deserve
what's coming to me.

08:13.477 --> 08:15.521
I think I'm gonna throw up.

08:16.105 --> 08:18.899
I have this thing about buses.
They make me sick.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.318
OK. All right. That's it.
I need fresh air.

08:21.318 --> 08:23.445
Not too much.

08:23.445 --> 08:25.489
Wait a minute.

08:25.698 --> 08:27.741
Uh-oh.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.119
Get some air.

08:30.119 --> 08:32.162
Is that better?

08:36.667 --> 08:38.794
(GROANS)

08:38.794 --> 08:40.879
Please...oh, please.

08:40.879 --> 08:44.550
Stay by the window. Get some air.
I'm going to take a little walk.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.677
Stretch my legs, you know?

08:46.677 --> 08:48.762
You OK?

08:51.265 --> 08:53.392
I'm feeling better already.

08:53.392 --> 08:54.560
I don't believe it.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.147
Hi, Sam.

09:02.651 --> 09:04.403
Now, listen, Al...

09:04.945 --> 09:07.740
Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.659
Do you mind?

09:11.577 --> 09:13.579
Sorry.
Sorry.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.041
Maxine.
Her name is Diane, not Maxine.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.084
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I know that.

09:19.626 --> 09:23.380
Her resemblance to Maxine
just blows my mind.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.257
What else have you found out?

09:25.257 --> 09:27.384
Well, Diane is innocent.

09:27.384 --> 09:29.511
And you have to clear her name.

09:29.511 --> 09:31.680
That's what Ziggy said?

09:31.680 --> 09:34.641
Uh...that's the way I interpret
the data.

09:35.392 --> 09:37.478
Al, just tell me what Ziggy said.

09:41.065 --> 09:44.818
He says there's a 99.9% chance

09:44.818 --> 09:46.528
that Diane stole the money.

09:46.528 --> 09:47.863
I knew it.

09:47.863 --> 09:49.782
But it's just like Maxine.

09:49.782 --> 09:51.950
Maxine?

09:51.950 --> 09:55.287
Yeah. The reason I divorced my wife
Maxine

09:55.287 --> 10:00.292
was because I was 99.9% sure
that she was cheating on me
with another guy.

10:00.292 --> 10:01.710
And a Marine.

10:01.710 --> 10:06.006
Don't tell me. When you got divorced
from her, you found she was innocent.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.966
Yeah, she was, and so is Diane.

10:07.966 --> 10:10.511
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

10:10.511 --> 10:13.555
Sam, I can see it in her eyes.

10:13.555 --> 10:18.560
You do not. You may feel it in your
loins, but you definitely do not see
it in her eyes.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.562
Sam...
What?

10:22.523 --> 10:24.525
I feel it in my loins.
Yeah.

10:26.151 --> 10:27.361
Uh-oh.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.197
Sam, Ziggy says tonight,
you and Diane get killed.

10:31.323 --> 10:32.616
How?

10:32.616 --> 10:38.080
Well, the official history
is that she shot Gordon,

10:38.080 --> 10:39.623
that's you -
Yeah.

10:39.623 --> 10:41.750
And then she was running away,

10:41.750 --> 10:43.836
and she got killed trying to escape.

10:45.337 --> 10:49.007
That doesn't make sense. She doesn't
seem the cold killer type.

10:49.007 --> 10:51.176
That shows how much you know.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.303
Yeah, well, she must have been
framed.

10:54.221 --> 11:00.143
Al, I don't care. I don't have time
to find out. I gotta get her to the
Decatur sheriff before she kills me.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.271
OK. Fine.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.314
I'll get out of here. See you.

11:19.121 --> 11:20.414
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.541
That's my hat. That's my hat.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.126
I'm sorry, sir.

11:24.126 --> 11:25.502
Sorry, sir.

11:25.502 --> 11:28.088
Hey, hey, hey!
What did you do that for?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.382
Get your hands off of him!
He was right!

11:30.382 --> 11:35.012
What? He said any man with a head
that ugly doesn't deserve such a
nice hat.

11:35.012 --> 11:37.097
No, I didn't say that.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.726
(EVERYONE SHOUTING)

11:42.394 --> 11:45.439
Hey, what's all that racket
back there? Quieten down.

11:46.898 --> 11:49.026
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

11:49.026 --> 11:51.069
(SHOUTING)

11:55.490 --> 11:57.034
Who started this?

12:11.798 --> 12:13.467
(GIGGLES)

12:13.467 --> 12:15.510
Great.
Sure is.

12:16.803 --> 12:18.847
You wanna throw my hat too?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.059
(LAUGHS)

12:24.186 --> 12:29.107
I'm stuck out here in the middle of
nowhere, handcuffed to a woman
who wants to kill me,

12:29.107 --> 12:33.195
and my best friend is trying to work
through guilt about his fifth wife.

12:33.195 --> 12:35.238
Can life get any worse than this?

12:35.864 --> 12:37.908
(THUNDER)

12:47.777 --> 12:49.820
I'm freezing. You don't have to give
up your jacket.

12:51.675 --> 12:54.095
If you're freezing, you're freezing.

13:03.352 --> 13:05.437
Thank you.

13:05.979 --> 13:08.065
You're welcome.

13:10.192 --> 13:12.235
Must be old, abandoned stables.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.573
No kidding.

13:16.573 --> 13:19.076
Did you get an advance
to agree to do this job?

13:20.077 --> 13:22.663
As a matter of fact, yes, I did.

13:23.664 --> 13:25.999
What was it, one of those mail order
deals?

13:26.166 --> 13:28.210
Have you always been this mean?

13:30.087 --> 13:31.922
No, just recently.

13:31.922 --> 13:33.966
My luck.

13:34.091 --> 13:35.801
Look...

13:35.801 --> 13:39.388
I haven't slept in a week.
I'm tired and wet...

13:39.388 --> 13:40.764
(SIGHS)

13:40.764 --> 13:42.265
I'm only human.

13:42.265 --> 13:44.434
A matter of opinion.

13:44.434 --> 13:46.770
I guess I deserved that.
I guess you did.

13:46.770 --> 13:49.815
You think it doesn't hurt,
that I don't have feelings?

13:52.275 --> 13:55.779
No - Well, you're wrong. I am a
woman, damn it, and I feel things.

13:58.949 --> 14:04.162
Like your hand next to mine.

14:04.162 --> 14:05.831
Well, it's the handcuffs.

14:05.831 --> 14:07.249
It's nothing. I just -

14:07.249 --> 14:09.334
Isn't it?

14:09.668 --> 14:12.379
On the bus, I felt your leg rubbing
against me.

14:12.379 --> 14:17.384
Now, come on. I fell asleep. We were
crammed like sardines in there,
and I probably just -

14:17.384 --> 14:19.594
You don't feel something too?

14:19.594 --> 14:22.222
What I feel is my skin crawling.

14:23.598 --> 14:24.975
Will you watch me?

14:24.975 --> 14:26.685
Come on. You're my prisoner.

14:28.061 --> 14:30.021
You make me feel so...

14:30.021 --> 14:32.065
vulnerable.

14:35.569 --> 14:38.613
You've got the guns
and the handcuffs.

14:40.699 --> 14:42.784
It's the middle of the night.

14:44.286 --> 14:46.371
All alone.

14:47.956 --> 14:50.876
If I were to call out for help,
nobody would help me.

14:50.876 --> 14:52.919
(THUNDER)

14:54.171 --> 14:56.256
But I wouldn't cry out.

14:57.466 --> 14:59.551
Cry help, that is.

15:01.595 --> 15:03.221
No.

15:03.221 --> 15:04.931
No.

15:04.931 --> 15:06.850
Come on.

15:06.850 --> 15:10.854
I'm going to put you on this side of
the barn and I'm going on the other.

15:10.854 --> 15:13.690
You think I was stupid enough to fall
for that? Huh?

15:14.691 --> 15:16.735
Come on.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.528
Gordon...Gordon...

15:18.528 --> 15:20.614
Look, come on. I don't...

15:23.074 --> 15:24.826
Oh!

15:24.826 --> 15:26.786
Oh, you're so predictable.

15:26.786 --> 15:30.373
I'm predictable? All right. I predict
that you're gonna get...

15:30.874 --> 15:33.001
15 to 20 years in the state pen.

15:33.001 --> 15:34.336
I'll deny it.

15:36.213 --> 15:38.298
Gordon...

15:40.926 --> 15:42.677
Are you OK?

15:42.677 --> 15:44.763
Gordon?

15:44.930 --> 15:46.973
What am I doing?

15:48.225 --> 15:51.478
Sam, what are you doing?
This is no time to take a snooze.

15:51.478 --> 15:56.608
Hurry up. She's trying to get away.
Look. She's trying to get out the
door. Oh, it's locked.

15:57.317 --> 16:00.403
Hurry up, Sam. Look, here she comes.
Grab her. Grab her!

16:01.529 --> 16:03.657
Grab her! Grab her!

16:03.657 --> 16:05.742
Look, she's going up the ladder,
Sam.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.578
Sam. Wait. I got an idea.

16:09.537 --> 16:13.041
Pull the ladder away from there
and then she'll be stuck on top.

16:17.879 --> 16:19.923
Drat.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.219
Try the windows. They don't work.

16:24.219 --> 16:27.472
All she's got is this ladder.
You'll be able to catch her.

16:27.472 --> 16:29.516
Here she comes. Get her. Get her.

16:30.141 --> 16:32.185
Hurry, Sam.

16:34.813 --> 16:36.439
Oh, man.

16:51.746 --> 16:53.790
What is this stuff?

16:57.085 --> 16:59.129
Manure.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.172
Oh...

17:05.260 --> 17:10.013
Boy, I'm glad I'm a hologram
and I don't have to smell you.
You must really reek.

17:10.013 --> 17:12.058
I stink.
You can say that again.

17:13.184 --> 17:14.602
You stink.

17:14.602 --> 17:17.396
You don't think you overdid it
on the ropes a bit?

17:17.396 --> 17:18.565
No, I don't.

17:18.565 --> 17:20.692
My nose itches. It's killing me.

17:20.692 --> 17:23.944
Good.

17:23.944 --> 17:25.280
(DOG YAPS)

17:25.280 --> 17:29.200
I've been lied to, punched, kicked,
thrown off a bus,

17:29.200 --> 17:31.536
flipped, kicked again
and knocked out,

17:31.536 --> 17:35.290
and I can't breathe around my own
self. This is the leap from hell.

17:35.290 --> 17:37.459
I've never seen you act so weird.

17:37.459 --> 17:39.711
Weird?
You fight all the time with her,

17:39.711 --> 17:42.756
just like I used to fight
with Maxine. Maxine!

17:42.756 --> 17:44.841
Bingo. I got it.
What?

17:44.841 --> 17:46.843
(LAUGHS) You're falling for her.

17:46.843 --> 17:48.970
Get outta town.

17:48.970 --> 17:50.889
Admit it.
That's ridiculous.

17:50.889 --> 17:54.476
You're falling in love with her.
I can't stand the sight of her.

17:54.476 --> 17:56.352
I can't stand the sight of you.

17:56.352 --> 17:59.939
It's a textbook example of love
and you are in the first stage.

17:59.939 --> 18:02.692
The first stage?
There are five stages of love.

18:02.692 --> 18:06.488
The first is denial, the second
is sex, then there's acceptance,

18:06.488 --> 18:09.866
then there's divorce, and then more
sex, if you're lucky.

18:09.866 --> 18:12.202
Who wrote this textbook,
you or Zsa Zsa?

18:12.202 --> 18:14.704
Well, it's not a book,
it's a theory of mine,

18:14.704 --> 18:16.873
and it's a darn good one, too.

18:16.873 --> 18:21.085
And in my estimation, you are on
the verge of the second stage.

18:21.085 --> 18:24.380
Sex?
Ha! Please.

18:24.380 --> 18:25.965
See? She wants it too.

18:25.965 --> 18:28.551
I don't want to talk about this
any more, OK?

18:28.551 --> 18:32.597
We're stuck here tonight, but
tomorrow we'll get to the nearest
town,

18:32.597 --> 18:35.850
I'll call the sheriff and have him
come and take her away.

18:35.850 --> 18:37.936
Don't do it, Sam.
Don't do what?

18:37.936 --> 18:39.896
Don't turn her in.

18:39.896 --> 18:41.314
Don't start.

18:41.314 --> 18:43.942
Sam, I'm right about this.
I feel it in my gut.

18:43.942 --> 18:48.947
My gut, plus the bump on my head
and the cracks in my - arh - ribs,
tell me that she's guilty.

18:48.947 --> 18:51.157
Unless you come up with some proof,

18:51.157 --> 18:55.787
Ziggy, for the first time in his
life, is right about this
and she belongs in jail.

18:55.787 --> 18:59.749
You are wrong. You're wrong about
all of this,

18:59.749 --> 19:01.876
and I am gonna prove it to you.

19:01.876 --> 19:04.921
OK. Fine. Go ahead. Prove me wrong.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.965
OK, I will.
OK, I will.

19:15.139 --> 19:17.558
You wanna sleep in your chair
or in the hay?

19:17.558 --> 19:19.644
Hay.

19:23.731 --> 19:25.066
Hey!

19:25.066 --> 19:27.151
Oh, come on!

19:28.069 --> 19:30.154
Don't do this, Gordon.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.824
Don't leave me tied up like this.

19:37.912 --> 19:39.956
(GROANS)

19:52.093 --> 19:55.304
Even though it kinda seems
like I'm a ruthless criminal,

19:56.347 --> 19:59.350
I just want you to know
that I didn't steal that money.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.021
Right.

20:03.021 --> 20:06.566
Rodney, my boss, he was running
this phoney gold share scheme.

20:08.317 --> 20:10.361
He knew I was onto him.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.783
I was afraid.

20:16.159 --> 20:18.244
I'm really innocent.

20:19.078 --> 20:22.331
Yeah, well, that's something
for Judge Andrew to decide.

20:25.043 --> 20:28.629
In Decatur, Rodney owns the judge
and jury.

20:37.764 --> 20:40.308
Yeah, well, OK.

20:40.892 --> 20:42.977
So, now I know.

20:43.978 --> 20:46.022
(GROANS)

20:47.440 --> 20:49.525
Good night.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.528
Night.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.035
There you go.

20:59.035 --> 21:00.828
You threw them off?

21:00.828 --> 21:03.998
Section 50-3P of the regulation
book.

21:04.707 --> 21:09.045
If it looks like I'm gonna die,
I can throw people off,
don't matter where.

21:09.545 --> 21:11.214
Damn!

21:11.214 --> 21:14.717
Simmer down, Rodney. He's just doing
his job.

21:14.717 --> 21:16.969
That's right. 
Y'all have a good day.

21:16.969 --> 21:18.638
Much obliged.

21:19.472 --> 21:24.477
Sheriff, that woman's got a million
dollars of my money stashed away
somewhere.

21:25.102 --> 21:26.771
I know that.

21:26.771 --> 21:30.775
She'd do anything to eliminate that
bounty hunter to get to my money.

21:30.775 --> 21:34.070
I wouldn't be surprised if she was
in Rio de Janeiro by now.

21:34.278 --> 21:36.531
It seems a little far to go
in one night.

21:36.531 --> 21:39.075
Probably just got sidetracked,
that's all.

21:39.075 --> 21:41.160
We'll give 'em a couple of hours.

21:41.494 --> 21:44.080
Are you just going to sit here
and do nothing?

21:44.080 --> 21:47.041
No, no, no, I was thinking about
getting a haircut.

21:47.041 --> 21:49.669
What do you think? Just a little
on the sides.

21:49.669 --> 21:51.754
Sheriff -
All right. All right.

21:51.754 --> 21:55.174
I'll ask Lawrence to call down
to the Arkansas state police.

21:55.716 --> 21:58.177
Then you and I are gonna get some
breakfast.

22:01.764 --> 22:04.308
Sir, this is Sheriff Michaels.
Do you read me?

22:05.476 --> 22:07.144
I read you, Sheriff.

22:07.144 --> 22:09.230
(COCK CROWS)

22:13.776 --> 22:15.695
Wait!
Oh, well.

22:15.695 --> 22:17.738
Here comes another one.

22:25.705 --> 22:28.958
It's the handcuffs. No-one will pick
us up if they see 'em.

22:31.961 --> 22:33.963
All right.

22:33.963 --> 22:36.007
I'm gonna take 'em off.

22:36.007 --> 22:38.134
But don't even think about bolting.

22:38.134 --> 22:40.303
Frankly, I don't have the strength.

22:40.303 --> 22:43.014
I didn't get any sleep last night,
thanks to you.

22:43.514 --> 22:44.765
Me?

22:44.765 --> 22:49.353
Do you know that you grind your
teeth when you sleep? I thought
I was in a sawmill.

22:49.353 --> 22:52.648
Well, you snore. I thought I was
sleeping next to the hogs.

22:54.191 --> 22:56.360
That's what my momma says.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.029
We both smell like hogs.

22:58.029 --> 23:00.323
What I wouldn't give for a shower.

23:01.949 --> 23:03.701
You live with your mother?

23:03.701 --> 23:07.705
Yeah. Last couple of years, after my
daddy had a stroke, she needs help.

23:08.205 --> 23:10.207
Here comes another one.

23:17.673 --> 23:20.051
You've never done this before,
have you?

23:20.051 --> 23:22.094
Huh? Oh, yeah. I used to...

23:22.970 --> 23:24.430
That's what I thought.

23:24.430 --> 23:26.849
Am I doing something wrong
with my thumb?

23:26.849 --> 23:30.978
It has nothing to do with your
thumb. It's your style, it's your
charisma.

23:31.395 --> 23:35.316
It's the way you present yourself
that says, 'I am worthy of a ride.'

23:35.316 --> 23:37.443
Are you kidding me? Charisma?

23:37.443 --> 23:39.528
Seriously.
(LAUGHS)

23:39.528 --> 23:41.572
Like you would know about charisma.

23:51.082 --> 23:53.125
Last one there is a rotten egg!

23:55.336 --> 23:56.629
Howdy, ma'am.

23:56.629 --> 23:58.714
Please, he's gonna kill me!

24:04.261 --> 24:05.763
Step on it.

24:05.763 --> 24:07.848
Yes, ma'am.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.360
Sam? Sam?

24:22.360 --> 24:24.403
Sam! Get up out of there!

24:25.112 --> 24:27.198
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

24:27.198 --> 24:29.242
Come on.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.410
If she gets away, you'll both die.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.997
I don't know what happened to me.
I was leaving.

24:36.207 --> 24:38.209
You know...

24:38.209 --> 24:40.211
I'm screwing everything up.

24:40.211 --> 24:42.129
It's Diane, you know?

24:42.129 --> 24:43.673
She drives me crazy.

24:43.673 --> 24:46.676
Hey, nobody said this was going to
be easy, you know.

24:46.676 --> 24:49.637
Give yourself a break.
You're closer than you think.

24:49.804 --> 24:51.222
OK.

24:51.222 --> 24:52.640
OK.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.891
You have Ziggy...

24:56.143 --> 24:58.187
send you to Diane.

24:58.562 --> 25:00.606
OK. Dusty, send me to Diane.

25:06.904 --> 25:08.447
Sam, she's here!

25:08.447 --> 25:10.574
She's here! Get up out of the mud!

25:10.574 --> 25:13.035
She's right around the corner, Sam.

25:13.035 --> 25:15.121
Hurry up!

25:20.042 --> 25:23.254
Hush, Sam. Quiet, quiet.
She's waiting behind a tree.

25:23.254 --> 25:27.466
The guy that picked her up must have
smelled that manure and threw her
out.

25:27.466 --> 25:30.094
Can't blame him. She's hitch-hiking.
Get her.

25:30.511 --> 25:32.555
No! No!

25:33.264 --> 25:36.642
All right. Watch out for that bush
behind you. It's full of -

25:36.642 --> 25:38.227
Argh! Thorns.

25:38.227 --> 25:39.437
All right.

25:39.437 --> 25:41.272
Get your hand out of my pocket.

25:41.564 --> 25:43.357
Arh!

25:52.366 --> 25:54.285
Well, that does it.

25:54.285 --> 25:56.203
Sheriff Michaels is on his way.

25:56.203 --> 25:58.247
What now?

25:58.622 --> 26:01.584
Well, he says he's not gonna be here
for an hour, so...

26:02.668 --> 26:04.795
and we're both tired.

26:04.795 --> 26:06.881
Excuse me.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.719
And we need to wash up.

26:13.054 --> 26:15.014
You're getting us a motel room?

26:15.014 --> 26:18.768
If you were the last women in the
world, I wouldn't come near you.

26:18.768 --> 26:20.478
Well, the same goes here.

26:20.478 --> 26:22.521
Well, fine.
Fine.

26:29.111 --> 26:30.279
Howdy.

26:30.279 --> 26:32.364
I'm hungry.

26:32.656 --> 26:35.618
I'll get you something to eat
when we're in the room.

26:35.618 --> 26:37.745
If I don't eat, I get faint.

26:37.745 --> 26:39.455
All right, all right.

26:39.455 --> 26:41.665
Could you get us a room, please,
and...

26:41.665 --> 26:43.793
What kind of sandwich do you want?

26:43.793 --> 26:45.836
Tuna, extra pickles.

26:49.006 --> 26:50.758
Here you go.

26:50.758 --> 26:52.843
And one for you.

26:54.929 --> 26:56.305
And some Cola.

26:56.305 --> 26:57.723
Yeah, yeah.

26:57.723 --> 26:59.767
And some toothbrushes.

27:00.267 --> 27:02.311
Some toothpaste.

27:02.436 --> 27:04.063
Some bandages.

27:04.063 --> 27:05.272
Antacids.

27:05.272 --> 27:07.358
OK, OK, that's fine.

27:07.691 --> 27:09.527
Now, here we go.
Thank you.

27:10.694 --> 27:12.738
Right. Let's see. We've got uh...

27:12.905 --> 27:16.033
a key, and we've got two sandwiches,

27:16.033 --> 27:17.618
two bottles of soda,

27:17.618 --> 27:20.704
some bandages, toothbrushes
and liniment.

27:21.664 --> 27:23.249
Liniment?

27:23.249 --> 27:28.045
Now, that comes to nine and a
quarter, plus $16.50 for your room,

27:28.045 --> 27:30.089
so, that'll be $25.75.

27:30.798 --> 27:32.841
Poor baby, did I work you over-hard?

27:34.301 --> 27:36.011
I can take it.

27:36.011 --> 27:37.471
Aww.

27:37.471 --> 27:39.390
Honeymooners.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.475
(LAUGHS)

27:41.892 --> 27:43.936
Here you go, sir.

27:52.111 --> 27:54.154
I just love this Bionic Woman.

27:55.197 --> 27:57.241
It's my favourite TV show.

27:57.658 --> 27:59.827
Ain't that something to aspire to?

27:59.827 --> 28:03.914
Really? I would have thought that
Demolition Derby was more your style.

28:06.208 --> 28:11.171
I always thought it'd be kinda neat
to be one of those undercover
agents, like Lindsay.

28:11.171 --> 28:13.048
(LAUGHS)

28:13.048 --> 28:14.675
What?

28:14.675 --> 28:19.054
As I see it, if you're a crook,
it's hard to pursue a career
in law enforcement.

28:19.054 --> 28:21.098
I am not a crook.

28:21.682 --> 28:24.810
You didn't forge a million
dollars' worth of cheques?

28:24.810 --> 28:27.021
I admit I forged Rodney's signature.

28:27.021 --> 28:30.149
Am I missing something?
It all ties in with the phoney -

28:30.149 --> 28:32.276
The phoney gold share scam. Right.

28:32.276 --> 28:37.990
He'd prey on all these old people
who trusted him with their
retirement money.

28:39.533 --> 28:41.577
And my momma was one of 'em.

28:44.413 --> 28:46.498
Want your pickle?

28:47.624 --> 28:49.543
No, you can have it.

28:49.543 --> 28:51.670
I was his accountant, anyway.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.797
And I sold the shares.

28:53.797 --> 28:55.466
You knew they were phoney?

28:55.466 --> 29:00.596
No, but when I found out, I realised
these people were ruined. I mean,
suicides happened.

29:00.596 --> 29:02.890
I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.558
So, you forged the cheques.

29:04.558 --> 29:06.602
I had to do something brave.

29:08.312 --> 29:12.191
It was the first time in my life
I ever had a chance to make
a difference.

29:13.233 --> 29:15.319
Only I did it badly.

29:15.778 --> 29:17.821
So, here we are.

29:17.821 --> 29:19.948
Why didn't you go to the police?

29:19.948 --> 29:22.034
I told you. Rodney owned the police.

29:22.576 --> 29:26.371
Even if he didn't, it'd be one or
two years before it came to trial.

29:26.371 --> 29:28.415
By then, the money would be long
gone.

29:28.707 --> 29:30.751
Where is the money?

29:31.293 --> 29:33.587
It's hidden. I was about to give it
back -

29:33.587 --> 29:35.339
When I caught up with you.

29:35.339 --> 29:38.717
You know, I got a feeling
that the money is already long gone.

29:41.261 --> 29:43.138
You don't believe me.

29:43.138 --> 29:46.308
Look, Diane, it doesn't matter
if I believe you or not.

29:46.308 --> 29:49.353
If you escape, you're gonna be hunted
down and killed.

29:50.354 --> 29:55.108
If you take me back to Decatur,
I'm as good as dead anyway,
so, what's the difference?

29:56.068 --> 29:58.153
Oh, man.

29:59.363 --> 30:01.406
Better get out that liniment.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.005
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

30:19.174 --> 30:21.093
Ay.

30:23.679 --> 30:25.556
Let me help.

30:25.556 --> 30:27.808
It's fine. I can do it myself,
thank you.

30:27.975 --> 30:30.143
Why? Afraid I'm gonna bite you?

30:30.143 --> 30:33.564
Bite me? No, I'm not afraid
you're gonna bite me.

30:33.564 --> 30:37.609
You've already kicked me, punched me,
thrown me into a pile of manure

30:37.609 --> 30:41.864
and bashed my head in with a car
door. Why would I worry about your
biting me?

30:41.864 --> 30:44.032
Let me help you.

30:44.032 --> 30:47.452
I can see you're in pain.
I feel bad. It was my fault.

30:50.581 --> 30:52.666
OK.

30:53.125 --> 30:55.210
OK, but only because I can't reach.

30:56.753 --> 30:58.839
Come on.

31:04.803 --> 31:06.471
What are you doing?

31:06.471 --> 31:08.599
Moving away any possible weapons.

31:08.599 --> 31:10.684
It is a terrible thing not to trust.

31:13.562 --> 31:15.606
Unbelievable.

31:32.122 --> 31:33.498
How's this?

31:33.498 --> 31:35.584
It's OK.

31:47.012 --> 31:49.056
How about there?

31:49.264 --> 31:51.350
It's...it's...fine.

31:52.392 --> 31:54.311
You're such a liar.

31:54.311 --> 31:55.645
You should talk.

31:55.645 --> 31:57.689
Cut it out.

31:58.315 --> 32:00.359
OK?

32:06.239 --> 32:08.367
Maybe we ought to cool this.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.410
OK.

32:40.649 --> 32:42.734
Think I'm a crook?

32:44.653 --> 32:46.696
I don't know.

32:49.282 --> 32:51.326
As soon as I start to trust you...

32:51.868 --> 32:53.286
I clobber you.

32:53.286 --> 32:56.373
Yes. You clobber me.

33:07.968 --> 33:10.011
Maybe you're right.

33:11.429 --> 33:13.515
I'll go see if my dress is dry.

33:37.956 --> 33:40.041
Oh, man.

34:16.870 --> 34:18.913
Am I crazy?

34:40.810 --> 34:42.896
(DOG BARKS)

34:49.485 --> 34:54.199
How could you do this? I trusted you.
Don't you have a conscience?

34:54.199 --> 34:55.992
I am a criminal, remember?

34:56.826 --> 34:58.495
I knew from the very first -

34:58.495 --> 35:00.538
Put 'em up.

35:01.289 --> 35:03.124
Turn around.

35:03.124 --> 35:05.168
I'm not afraid to use this.

35:06.961 --> 35:10.924
What are you gonna do,
shoot me in the back?
I wouldn't put it past you.

35:10.924 --> 35:13.218
You're hurting my feelings.
Over there.

35:14.094 --> 35:16.179
Get your handcuffs.

35:16.888 --> 35:18.515
On the trellis.

35:18.515 --> 35:20.558
Don't do this, Diane.

35:21.142 --> 35:23.186
Your life depends on it.
Shut up.

35:26.356 --> 35:28.024
Higher.

35:28.024 --> 35:30.110
Higher.

35:32.362 --> 35:34.531
Please, Diane. You gotta believe me.

35:34.531 --> 35:36.574
Be quiet.

35:39.327 --> 35:41.663
That's not my gun.
Where did you get that?

35:41.663 --> 35:43.581
That's it.

35:43.581 --> 35:45.708
Smoke?

35:45.708 --> 35:47.627
(LAUGHS) Isn't that great?

35:47.627 --> 35:49.754
It's got 1,001 uses.

35:49.754 --> 35:51.840
You can light your cigarettes...

35:52.966 --> 35:55.260
Stick up a convenience store.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.345
Oh, make that 1,002.

35:57.345 --> 35:59.472
Got it at the motel gift shop.

35:59.472 --> 36:01.599
I did not acquire it honestly,

36:01.599 --> 36:03.685
so, I guess now I really am a crook.

36:05.103 --> 36:08.148
I don't know how I'm gonna be able
to live with myself.

36:08.148 --> 36:10.275
Have a nice day.

36:10.275 --> 36:12.318
(LAUGHS)

36:19.742 --> 36:22.537
Oh. Here, this is for the lighter.

36:24.873 --> 36:27.167
Oh, you are the bounty hunter from
hell.

36:27.167 --> 36:28.626
What was that all about?

36:28.626 --> 36:29.752
Nothing.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.462
You were paying for the gun.

36:31.462 --> 36:33.047
What of it?

36:33.047 --> 36:35.717
Well, well, well. Ain't you two
a pretty sight?

36:41.306 --> 36:43.474
Got a little sidetracked, huh, boy?

36:43.474 --> 36:46.311
Yeah, well...
Don't you worry. I'll take over now.

36:47.312 --> 36:49.522
I'll see that you get paid for this.

36:49.522 --> 36:53.526
I expect you're pretty happy to see
the end of this little lady.
Come on.

36:53.818 --> 36:55.445
Yeah.

36:55.445 --> 36:57.530
Happy.

36:59.032 --> 37:00.325
Where's she going?

37:00.325 --> 37:03.202
What difference does it make?
She's still alive.

37:03.202 --> 37:06.164
What difference does it make?
Yeah, but not for long.

37:07.415 --> 37:09.459
She dies in 20 minutes.

37:21.152 --> 37:25.198
Sam, Ziggy says that she gets shot
trying to escape, but...

37:25.198 --> 37:28.994
but that doesn't make any sense,
because she's already in custody.

37:31.288 --> 37:33.331
Where's Diane's boss?

37:33.498 --> 37:34.833
Rodney Owens?

37:34.833 --> 37:36.501
Yeah.

37:36.501 --> 37:38.920
Have Ziggy find out where Diane's
going.

37:38.920 --> 37:43.800
I have a feeling that wherever the
sheriff was taking her, Rodney's
gonna be close by.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.260
OK.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.304
Hey -

38:01.985 --> 38:04.112
How much is he paying, sheriff?

38:04.112 --> 38:07.157
None of your business, darling.
I'm not your darling.

38:08.241 --> 38:10.285
Hey! You slimy punk.

38:11.578 --> 38:13.496
Come on, Rodney, don't hit her.

38:13.496 --> 38:15.332
That's telling him, sheriff.

38:15.332 --> 38:19.085
Knock her out, she won't be able to
tell us where she hid the money.

38:19.085 --> 38:20.295
You scum.

38:20.295 --> 38:22.255
That's telling him, Diane.

38:22.255 --> 38:24.382
All right, Diane.
Tell me nicely once.

38:24.883 --> 38:26.718
Nicely.

38:26.718 --> 38:28.762
Where's the money?

38:29.888 --> 38:32.015
Oh!
AL: You said nicely, you rat.

38:32.015 --> 38:34.851
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me.

38:34.851 --> 38:39.981
Diane, I give you my word of honour.
You tell us where you hid the money
and we'll let you go.

38:39.981 --> 38:42.192
AL: Yeah, right into a speeding
bullet.

38:44.069 --> 38:46.196
Stop. Stop. I'll talk.

38:46.196 --> 38:47.822
All right. She'll talk.

38:47.822 --> 38:49.866
I said I'll talk.

38:54.579 --> 38:56.623
Will you promise you'll let me go?

38:57.082 --> 38:59.042
Yeah.
Word of honour.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.086
Don't tell 'em, Diane.

39:02.128 --> 39:03.588
Travel Town.

39:03.588 --> 39:05.632
Travel Town? Whereabouts?

39:06.382 --> 39:08.426
In a train.

39:08.426 --> 39:10.470
Which one?

39:11.137 --> 39:13.556
There's so many, I don't remember
exactly.

39:14.390 --> 39:17.268
You don't remember where you hid
a million dollars?

39:17.685 --> 39:19.729
Silly me. I was in such a rush.

39:21.064 --> 39:23.107
I guess I'll just have to show you.

39:25.068 --> 39:27.111
OK.

39:27.654 --> 39:29.781
Hang in there, Diane.
I'll bring help.

39:34.118 --> 39:35.870
She's in real trouble, Sam.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.163
How close are we?

39:37.163 --> 39:40.333
They're about three miles ahead
of you, so, step on it.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.418
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's OK.

39:42.418 --> 39:44.337
But that Rodney twisted her arm.

39:44.337 --> 39:45.588
What? Dammit.

39:45.588 --> 39:47.715
She told him where she hid
the money.

39:47.715 --> 39:51.678
Some place called Travel Town. I
guess you were right. She's a crook.

39:51.678 --> 39:53.346
No. No, she's not.

39:53.346 --> 39:55.807
But she just said -
No, she took the money.

39:55.807 --> 39:59.602
Right. In order to give it back
to the people that Rodney swindled.

39:59.602 --> 40:00.770
I hope.

40:00.770 --> 40:03.356
How do you know she didn't
take it to keep it?

40:03.356 --> 40:07.860
She couldn't even steal a toy gun,
paid first chance she got.
A crook wouldn't.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.237
See, I told you.

40:09.237 --> 40:12.574
You had to say that.
She never killed that bounty hunter.

40:12.574 --> 40:18.538
Gordon must have been onto what
Sheriff Michaels and Rodney were up
to, and followed 'em to Travel Town.

40:18.538 --> 40:21.499
And they killed him and made it look
like Diane did it.

40:21.749 --> 40:24.294
When she gave them the money,
they killed her.

40:26.588 --> 40:28.756
Except...except this time -

40:28.756 --> 40:31.634
What are you doing over there?
You're not Gordon.

40:31.634 --> 40:34.929
And you're gonna get killed
unless you think of something.

40:50.278 --> 40:53.072
You don't care about the people
you ripped off?

40:53.072 --> 40:57.994
They knew their investment
was highly speculative.
Everyone was aware of the risks.

40:57.994 --> 41:01.289
Mrs Bridges and Mr Henderson
weren't. My mother wasn't.

41:01.289 --> 41:04.667
Closed Monday. I guess we'll
have to come some other time.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.712
I don't suppose we'll get arrested
for trespassing.

41:07.712 --> 41:09.756
All right, all right.

41:11.549 --> 41:12.633
Hm.

41:12.633 --> 41:15.428
Now, where did I put that...

41:16.137 --> 41:17.847
silly money?

41:17.847 --> 41:20.558
Now, Diane, don't be wasting
our time.

41:21.017 --> 41:23.144
(LAUGHS) I remember now.

41:23.144 --> 41:25.438
It's...it's um...right up here.

41:28.066 --> 41:30.109
In the boiler thing.

41:34.405 --> 41:36.949
Hey, Rodney, you follow her.
I'll go this way.

41:49.170 --> 41:51.214
Hold it right there.

41:52.298 --> 41:56.969
That was not too smart, missy.
You're forcing me to do something
I don't want to do.

41:56.969 --> 41:58.930
Go ahead. Kill me. I don't care.

41:58.930 --> 42:01.140
How about your momma?
I could kill her.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.184
You leave my mother out of this!

42:04.227 --> 42:06.854
I'll be glad to. Just show me
where the money is.

42:12.819 --> 42:14.862
Al!

42:14.862 --> 42:19.575
Have Ziggy scan me on Diane.
When you find her, call me,
and I'll follow your voice.

42:19.575 --> 42:21.786
Hurry up. We only got about two
minutes.

42:24.413 --> 42:26.457
AL: Sam! Over here!

42:27.250 --> 42:28.751
Can you hear me?

42:28.751 --> 42:30.002
Here it is.

42:30.002 --> 42:32.046
AL: She's only got about 20 seconds.

42:38.052 --> 42:40.096
Sam!

42:40.429 --> 42:42.014
You promised to let me go.

42:42.014 --> 42:44.350
- AL: Only about ten seconds!
- That right?

42:44.517 --> 42:46.477
That's right.

42:46.477 --> 42:48.604
Well, who's stopping you?

42:48.604 --> 42:50.648
Five...

42:51.566 --> 42:53.568
Sam!
(SHOT FIRED)

43:06.581 --> 43:08.624
Wait! Wait!

43:08.624 --> 43:10.668
Hold it.

43:12.461 --> 43:14.797
I never thought I'd be so glad to
see you.

43:14.797 --> 43:16.883
You OK?
That's it, Sam. You did it.

43:16.883 --> 43:18.926
Get your hands up.

43:20.052 --> 43:23.222
Uh-oh. Oh. Now the odds are dropping
down the other way.

43:23.222 --> 43:24.473
What does that mean?

43:24.473 --> 43:26.517
That's not a gun. It's a lighter.

43:32.607 --> 43:35.651
Wow. Thank God my wife Maxine
couldn't kick like that.

43:36.569 --> 43:38.613
Gee.

43:42.742 --> 43:47.038
I'm holding a million dollars,
so don't even think of taking
even one dollar.

43:49.165 --> 43:50.916
Look,

43:50.916 --> 43:53.252
this may be hard for you to believe,
but...

43:54.003 --> 43:56.047
I'm not here for the money.

43:58.507 --> 44:00.593
OK.

44:00.593 --> 44:02.637
I trust you.

44:09.518 --> 44:11.562
Tell you what,

44:12.521 --> 44:16.609
there are gonna be a lot of happy
people when they open up their mail
boxes.

44:17.068 --> 44:19.612
Better than a letter
from the clearing house.

44:20.237 --> 44:22.406
Ha! See, I told you from the start.

44:22.406 --> 44:24.492
I told you she was innocent.

44:24.825 --> 44:27.453
Boy, she looks a lot like my fifth
wife, Maxine.

44:32.875 --> 44:34.627
Well, that does it.

44:34.627 --> 44:36.837
Ready to turn myself in.

44:37.588 --> 44:40.883
Maybe I'll get better treatment
from the state police.

44:40.883 --> 44:43.219
The charges against Diane
get dropped,

44:43.219 --> 44:46.305
and Sheriff Michaels and Rodney
get 15 years in the pen.

44:48.641 --> 44:51.519
Well, I guess this is it.

44:53.604 --> 44:55.648
I guess this is it.

44:57.108 --> 44:59.235
I hope you're not sore for too long.

44:59.235 --> 45:01.278
Yeah, well, me too.

45:03.197 --> 45:04.740
Well...

45:04.740 --> 45:06.784
goodbye, then.

45:08.786 --> 45:10.830
I guess so.

45:13.332 --> 45:15.376
Oh, man.

45:20.005 --> 45:22.049
So long.

45:23.175 --> 45:24.844
Why haven't I leaped?

45:24.844 --> 45:26.262
Did you say something?

45:26.262 --> 45:29.098
You've got some unfinished
business with Diane.

45:29.098 --> 45:31.142
Diane, uh...

45:35.104 --> 45:37.148
Are you gonna be OK?

45:37.606 --> 45:39.650
Yeah, I'm gonna be OK.

45:40.192 --> 45:42.403
Just gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do.

45:45.114 --> 45:49.535
Well, after seeing some of the tricks
you pulled on me the last couple of
days,

45:49.535 --> 45:51.662
maybe you ought to be a bounty
hunter.

45:51.662 --> 45:53.122
A bounty hunter?

45:53.122 --> 45:54.582
Well, you know...

45:54.582 --> 45:56.625
I could be a bounty hunter.

45:57.459 --> 45:59.211
Now, I was just kidding.

45:59.211 --> 46:02.381
What's the matter, you couldn't
stand the competition?

46:10.180 --> 46:12.224
She does OK, Sam.

46:12.474 --> 46:15.769
She becomes one of the best bounty
hunters in the business.

46:36.373 --> 46:37.875
Wait. Wait a minute.

46:37.875 --> 46:40.044
There's been some kind of a mistake.

46:40.044 --> 46:42.463
You're the one who made the mistake,
Jesus.

46:42.922 --> 46:44.131
No. Jesus, no.

46:44.131 --> 46:46.342
Just try to think of some place
far away.

46:51.722 --> 46:53.641
Let it be known

46:53.641 --> 46:56.685
that on the 12th day of May, 1971,

46:56.685 --> 46:58.854
in the presence of these witnesses,

46:58.854 --> 47:02.733
that Jesus Ortego was condemned
by the state of Florida

47:02.733 --> 47:04.777
to death by electrocution.

47:07.029 --> 47:09.073
Oh, God.
