11:16.520 --> 11:17.922
Oh, Moleman,

11:17.922 --> 11:20.594
I can't imagine my life
without you seated next to me

11:20.594 --> 11:23.266
every night
here at D'ohs Tavern.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.334
You're my best friend.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.305
I'm cold.

11:26.305 --> 11:27.575
(sighs)

11:27.575 --> 11:29.077
Hmm?

11:29.077 --> 11:31.583
One teen was killed
by a pie to the face.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.154
Another's intestines were
twisted into balloon animals.

11:34.154 --> 11:36.927
And the last, choked by a chain
of hankies so long,

11:36.927 --> 11:38.864
police are still pulling it out.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.368
No, the clown can't be back.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.139
Unless it's...
(gasps)

11:43.139 --> 11:45.611
27 years later.

11:45.611 --> 11:49.251
I got to tell the other Losers
that it's time to come home,

11:49.251 --> 11:50.955
so we can end this.

11:50.955 --> 11:55.496
I wonder if their lives
turned out as lousy as mine.

Message for you
from your old hometown.

12:18.075 --> 12:21.348
Something about
a childhood pact.

12:21.348 --> 12:22.551
Ah...

12:22.551 --> 12:25.490
A pact is a pact.
I'm on my way.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.229
Uh, I got to go, guys.

12:28.229 --> 12:31.135
Oh, here's the instructions

<i>Ten, nine...</i>

12:34.274 --> 12:37.314
Homer, it's so nice
to hear your voice

12:37.314 --> 12:39.552
after all these years.

12:39.552 --> 12:42.190
Wow, CEO of your own company.

12:42.190 --> 12:45.731
You know, I pictured you growing
up to be a softball superstar.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.235
Aw, you were always so sweet.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.639
How have you been?

12:49.639 --> 12:52.511
So good.
I practically live on Reddit.

12:52.511 --> 12:54.314
But did you ever get the feeling

12:54.314 --> 12:57.253
that we missed our chance?

12:57.253 --> 12:58.890
I do.
I sure wish

12:58.890 --> 13:01.261
we'd done it 27 years ago.

13:01.261 --> 13:04.502
(gasps) Me too!
Oh, it's all I think about.

13:04.502 --> 13:06.806
Oh, you mean kill Krusto.

13:06.806 --> 13:08.710
Yeah, that would've
been good, too.

13:08.710 --> 13:12.017
Oh, I want to help,
but I'm not sure I can.

13:12.017 --> 13:14.589
I have responsibilities now.

13:14.589 --> 13:16.693
-Hi, Mom.
-What up, Big Blue?

13:16.693 --> 13:19.197
Bert, my little jazz tubist.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.003
And Lizzie,
my special little gal.

13:22.003 --> 13:25.978
Mom, I got an A-plus on my
Elizabeth Cady Stanton diorama.

13:25.978 --> 13:27.848
I threw a stink bomb
in the teacher's lounge

13:27.848 --> 13:29.151
and bike-locked the door.

13:29.151 --> 13:32.692
Well, I'm so proud
of one of those things.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.629
Who's Homer Simpson?

13:34.629 --> 13:36.533
That's a dumb-ass name.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.235
Really?
Our father's name is...

13:38.235 --> 13:39.939
Comic Book Guy.

13:39.939 --> 13:42.912
Homer Simpson is someone
we knew back in Kingfield.

13:42.912 --> 13:46.452
A town we will
never set foot in again.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.822
Mm...

13:47.822 --> 13:49.692
Homer needs us.
We're the only ones

13:49.692 --> 13:51.563
who can kill the clown.

13:51.563 --> 13:52.832
We're adults now.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.370
A kid murderer is a kid problem.

13:55.370 --> 13:58.977
What happened to the boy
who admired my bravery so much

13:58.977 --> 14:00.714
he put it in a poem?

14:00.714 --> 14:02.785
B-By that, you mean me,
of course.

14:02.785 --> 14:04.856
Well, I am a husband now,
and a father.

14:04.856 --> 14:06.693
And I'm-I'm...

14:06.693 --> 14:09.097
-I'm...
-The same little coward...

14:09.097 --> 14:11.402
You always were!
(roars)

14:12.203 --> 14:13.573
Aah!

14:13.573 --> 14:15.811
Marge, I had a dream
about him.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.715
He was just as scary
as I remember,

14:17.715 --> 14:20.353
but updated
for a Gen Z audience.

14:20.353 --> 14:22.257
Honey? Honey?

14:24.629 --> 14:26.031
(grumbles)

14:26.933 --> 14:28.402
To the Losers.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.373
The Losers.

14:30.373 --> 14:33.780
So, how the hell are we gonna
stop that unkillable clown?

14:33.780 --> 14:35.851
We ain't exactly children
no more.

14:35.851 --> 14:37.955
Yeah, but we're still friends.

14:37.955 --> 14:39.859
We're still
full of childlike wonder.

14:39.859 --> 14:41.629
We're still virgins.

14:41.629 --> 14:43.165
-Eesh.
-Mm...

14:43.165 --> 14:46.506
Yeah, we're still, uh...
(clears throat)

14:46.506 --> 14:50.146
Well, whenever
I need to find my courage,

14:50.146 --> 14:53.486
I think of a poem Comic Book Guy
wrote for me when we were kids.

14:53.486 --> 14:54.989
Poem?

14:54.989 --> 14:57.093
It's why
I fell in love with him.

14:57.828 --> 14:58.964
Marge, there's something

14:58.964 --> 15:01.201
I have to tell you right now,

15:01.201 --> 15:03.940
because if I wait
even one more second--

15:03.940 --> 15:08.048
I'm talking one single second,
just one--

15:08.048 --> 15:09.752
something might happen
that will make me not...

15:09.752 --> 15:11.823
-(door opens)
-BERT and LIZZIE: Mom!

15:11.823 --> 15:13.927
Oh... be able to tell you.

15:13.927 --> 15:17.033
Kids, no,
what are you doing here?

15:17.033 --> 15:19.004
They're here
to collect their mother.

15:19.004 --> 15:21.408
Kids, be good
and wait in the car.

15:21.408 --> 15:25.149
Mommy and Daddy have some
grown-up yelling to discuss.

15:25.951 --> 15:28.489
Mom and Dad's hometown
sure sucks.

15:28.489 --> 15:32.430
Misspelled pet cemetery,
Salem's parking lot,

15:32.430 --> 15:36.906
mysterious antique store
that charges by the soul.

15:36.906 --> 15:38.677
What the hell are you watching?

15:38.677 --> 15:40.213
Oh...

15:40.213 --> 15:43.352
Wake up!
We barely escaped last time.

15:43.352 --> 15:46.659
Why risk our lives now
when we have so much to lose?

15:46.659 --> 15:47.928
Present Homers excluded.

15:47.928 --> 15:49.364
(phones dinging, ringing)

15:50.466 --> 15:54.174
<i>Hope you Losers weren't</i>
<i>thinking of leaving just yet.</i>

15:54.174 --> 15:57.915
<i>Not without seeing</i>
<i>my new star attraction.</i>

15:57.915 --> 15:59.217
<i>Help, Mom!</i>

15:59.217 --> 16:02.423

16:02.423 --> 16:03.425
No!

16:03.425 --> 16:05.463
(cackles)

16:08.269 --> 16:09.471
Our kids!

16:09.471 --> 16:10.741
Our phones.

16:10.741 --> 16:12.812
Now it's personal.

16:12.812 --> 16:16.418
Just like it always was.

16:17.655 --> 16:19.725
(grunts)

16:21.461 --> 16:24.535
(sniffs) I smell
thousand-year-old flop sweat.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.171
We must be close.

16:28.275 --> 16:30.012
-LIZZIE: Finally!
-BERT: Mom, Dad!

16:30.012 --> 16:31.081
-Up here!
-(gasps)

16:31.081 --> 16:33.954
Kids! Oh...

16:33.954 --> 16:35.223
Aah!

16:35.223 --> 16:38.830
Well, well.
If it isn't the Losers.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.237
Say hello to my studio audience.

16:43.005 --> 16:44.642
(children laughing)

16:49.952 --> 16:53.459
There's no laughter
like forced laughter.

16:53.459 --> 16:56.198
We're not afraid of you
anymore, clown.

16:56.198 --> 16:58.168
You have no power over us.

16:58.168 --> 17:01.241
He's an astronaut,
she's a seltzer big wig,

17:01.241 --> 17:03.345
and I'm a world-famous,

17:03.345 --> 17:05.951
um, virgin.

17:05.951 --> 17:07.253
Oh, damn it.

17:07.253 --> 17:10.661
The point is we've conquered
our childhood fears.

17:10.661 --> 17:14.902
Ah, but adults have something
much tastier than fears.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.138
Anxieties.

17:16.138 --> 17:18.209
Millions of tiny,

17:18.209 --> 17:20.981
delicious anxieties.

17:20.981 --> 17:22.450
(yelps)

17:22.450 --> 17:24.221
Oh!

17:25.524 --> 17:27.260
(screeching)

17:27.260 --> 17:28.863
You know what I'm thankful for?

17:28.863 --> 17:32.470
The filibuster.
Let's talk about it.

17:32.470 --> 17:33.506
ALL:
Aah!

17:33.506 --> 17:35.076
-(screeching)
-(all whimpering)

17:35.076 --> 17:37.615
But you-- you've got something

17:37.615 --> 17:40.152
worth worrying about.

17:40.152 --> 17:42.056
Why don't I tell Marge

17:42.056 --> 17:44.094
you put your name on the poem

17:44.094 --> 17:46.465
that won her heart, eh?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.004
(yelps)

17:49.004 --> 17:51.108
No, no, please.

17:51.108 --> 17:53.045
It-it wasn't you?

17:53.045 --> 17:56.118
I tried to tell you,
just not very hard.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.389
My life is a lie.

17:58.389 --> 17:59.692
Oh...

18:02.698 --> 18:04.401
He must get his sinister powers

18:04.401 --> 18:06.606
from his captive audience.

18:06.606 --> 18:08.442
Just like Jimmy Fallon.

18:08.442 --> 18:11.448
You have to destroy the sign!

18:16.358 --> 18:18.262
Only you can do it, Marge.

18:18.262 --> 18:20.266
Your arm is summer lightning.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.103
Your bravery, the storm.

18:22.103 --> 18:24.274
You're the chimp in the zoo.

18:24.274 --> 18:27.246
And I'm still bananas for you.

18:27.246 --> 18:30.219
Now, throw, throw!

18:50.694 --> 18:52.296
