WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:06.672
Almost ready, dad?

00:06.674 --> 00:07.973
We got to get
a little practice in.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.242
- Just lacing up.
- ( Blows whistle )

00:10.244 --> 00:12.678
Delay of game on dad!

00:13.646 --> 00:15.647
Okay, Parker,
if you want to be our ref,

00:15.649 --> 00:17.282
at least wait
until we start playing.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.651
( Blows whistle )
Talking back to the ref,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.186
technical foul!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.526
What are those?

00:31.965 --> 00:34.066
Those are shorts.

00:34.068 --> 00:38.103
It was a dark time in fashion
before you were born.

00:38.105 --> 00:41.106
These are prime-time
Pete Rooney's lucky shorts.

00:41.108 --> 00:45.210
to the state championship,
so he's wearing them now.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.280
And when he talks about
himself in the third person,

00:48.282 --> 00:53.819
it means prime-time
Pete Rooney's fixing to win.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.188
Our town has a big
two-on-two tournament

00:56.190 --> 00:57.656
where an adult teams up
with a kid

00:57.658 --> 01:00.626
and, uh, ha,
no girl's ever won...

01:00.628 --> 01:03.629
Till now.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.764
I was saying that I'm gonna
be the first girl to win.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.000
Was that not clear without
the "bam, what?" Yeah, okay.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.802
Bam!
What?!

01:09.804 --> 01:11.036
Okay, dad.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.638
I've seen you holding
a clipboard on the court.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.873
Now let's see
if you can still play.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.077
Oh, I can still play.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.179
Check it.
What?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.647
Oh, oh no.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.693
Just a little rusty.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.062
( Blows whistle ) Traveling!

01:37.064 --> 01:38.931
- Traveling?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:38.933 --> 01:41.166
Those tiny shorts are
traveling right up your butt.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.602
( Laughs, snorts )

01:43.604 --> 01:45.704
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

01:45.706 --> 01:47.306
<i>¶ Better in stereo</i>

01:47.308 --> 01:49.274
<i>¶ b... b... better in stereo</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:51.343
- <i>¶ I'm up with the sunshine</i>
<i>- ¶ let's go</i>

01:51.345 --> 01:53.712

02:31.118 --> 02:33.685
<i>¶ we're better in stereo.</i>

02:35.788 --> 02:38.123
Whew.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.958
This is tough.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.796
but I am not particularly
gifted in the sports department.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.366
Trust me.
It looks like it.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.103
Oh, I am dying

02:51.105 --> 02:53.071
to kick that ball out
from under you.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.407
( Gasps ) But you seem

02:55.409 --> 02:57.889
to have gotten
yourself a bodyguard.

02:59.279 --> 03:00.979
Parker,
this is Bernard.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.016
I entered a raffle at the mall
to win a personal trailer.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.718
Turns out it was
for a personal trainer...

03:07.720 --> 03:09.721
Which I do not need.

03:09.723 --> 03:13.392
Joey, you need a trainer much
more than you need a trailer.

03:13.394 --> 03:17.162
I respectfully
disagree, tree top.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.265
A trailer's like
a bathroom on wheels.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.467
The possibilities
are endless.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.871
A trainer can give you tips
on fitness and nutrition,

03:25.873 --> 03:28.373
but also make
your lives happier...

03:28.375 --> 03:30.309
And healthier.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.010
I'm already happy

03:32.012 --> 03:34.846
and healthy-ish.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.848
Joey, when
I was your age,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.483
I hated to work out too.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.186
The ladies laughed
at Bernard 1.0.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.091
( Laughs )

03:47.260 --> 03:51.363
But the ladies love
Bernard 2.0 much more.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.198
( Kisses )

03:54.801 --> 03:57.970
Oh, I want
the ladies to love me...

03:57.972 --> 04:00.038
Or at least know
that I'm alive.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.875
I am a pathetic

04:03.877 --> 04:05.377
lump of Clay.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.912
Mold me.

04:06.914 --> 04:07.980
( Whimpers )

04:11.751 --> 04:13.285
Oh, hey, Liv.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.354
Oh, sitting
and reading.

04:15.356 --> 04:19.391
I remember when I used
to have time for that.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.960
Yeah, it's a play that
the drama club is doing.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.962
And they
offered me the lead.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.197
- <i>( Laughs )</i>
<i>- Fun.</i>

04:25.199 --> 04:27.866
Your first role since
¶ sing it loud.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.405
Yeah, please don't
ever do that again.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.109
It's a story about
a working mother

04:37.111 --> 04:39.945
who struggles to juggle
her career, home, and kids.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.313
( Laughs, sighs )

04:41.315 --> 04:43.315
I'm just really not sure
that I can pull it off.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.818
I have that same thought
every day of my life.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.322
But, like, do we really want
to play a character who is

04:50.324 --> 04:53.825
so overworked
and haggard

04:53.827 --> 04:57.229
that she can barely make it
through her day?

04:57.231 --> 05:00.399
- Wow, that does sound terrible.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

05:00.401 --> 05:02.134
Well, is there another
character in the play

05:02.136 --> 05:03.602
who's single
and doesn't have kids?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.971
- Actually, her sister.
- Play her.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.242
Hey, madds.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.943
Rehearsal any better
with dad today?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.379
Okay, one,
it's called practice.

05:14.381 --> 05:18.116
Two, rehearsal
was a disaster.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.986
He's running slower.
He's shooting worse.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.422
And somehow his shorts
got even shorter.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.391
Does this mean that
you aren't gonna be

05:26.393 --> 05:29.227
the first girl to win
the pageant... tournament?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.163
I knew it was wrong
the second I said it.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.900
Well, I'm certainly not gonna
win with dad on my team.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.401
What do I do?

05:36.403 --> 05:38.337
Okay.
Here is an exercise

05:38.339 --> 05:39.538
that I've done
in the past.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.907
Close your eyes
and let's visualize

05:41.909 --> 05:45.544
the best possible
solution to your problem.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.058
Whoa.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.562
Oh, yeah.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.963
Liv, Maddie,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.631
this is Bernard,
my personal trainer.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.934
He's gonna get me
all jacked!

06:10.303 --> 06:13.939
Which he says
means muscular.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.140
Nice to meet you.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.875
Um, where is the trash?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.414
- Whoo!
- Ugh!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.983
( Both grunting )

06:24.985 --> 06:29.187
Thank you. I played a little
college ball back in the day.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.925
But come on, Joey.
The gym is that way.

06:35.528 --> 06:39.030
I got to get you ripped.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.567
"Ripped," that also
means muscular.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.371
Okay,
the visualization thing

06:46.373 --> 06:48.940
has <i>never </i> worked
that well before.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.377
So that was the universe
telling me to dump dad, right?

06:52.379 --> 06:55.480
The universe is screaming
at you to dump dad.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.681
Let's ride this wave.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.217
Okay, now close
your eyes with me

06:59.219 --> 07:03.188
and let's visualize
Ryan gosling.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.027
- Hey, teammate.
- Hey, coach.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.462
I need to talk to you
about the tournament.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.431
Great. I've been
working on my jumper,

07:12.433 --> 07:13.565
getting my rhythm back.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.668
What? Oh.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.237
Yeah, so, dad, um...

07:19.239 --> 07:22.274
You and I have had some
really great times together.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.511
I just don't think that
it's gonna work out.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.947
What are you saying?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.583
I'm breaking up with you.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.718
What?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.621
Why? What did I do?
I can change.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.324
I can be better.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.626
See, it's not you,
it's me.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.529
But I'm your dad.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.732
Right, and I will
always have a...

07:47.734 --> 07:50.469
Special place
in my heart for you,

07:50.471 --> 07:53.472
but it's just time
that I move on.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.508
I think in the long run, this is
gonna be better for both of us.

07:56.510 --> 08:00.679
Wow. Wow.
I can't believe this.

08:00.681 --> 08:05.116
I thought we were
good together, you and me.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.253
( Laughs ) This is awkward.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.454
Dad, there's someone else.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.522
( Gasps )

08:13.359 --> 08:16.094
Are you okay?

08:16.096 --> 08:18.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine, you know.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.032
Just a little surprised,
but it's cool, you know.

08:21.034 --> 08:25.403
You do you.
I'll do me.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.206
Maybe I'll just get
a ride home with mom.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.407
I think that
would be best.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.447
Thank you so much

08:35.449 --> 08:36.648
for agreeing to be
on my team, Bernard.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.417
Sure thing, teammate.
I'm so excited.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.699
Now, hit me up top.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.192
How about I hit you up
the middle?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.360
Okay.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.728
Boo.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.597
Now, let's win this tournament.
Bam! What?!

08:52.599 --> 08:55.500
( Laughs )

08:55.502 --> 08:57.402
I like that.
Can I give it a try?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.170
I mean, you know,
it's kind of my thing,

08:59.172 --> 09:00.205
but try it.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.275
Okay.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.343
Bam! What?!

09:05.345 --> 09:07.445
( Exclaims )

09:07.447 --> 09:11.616
You, my good sir,
are a natural bam-what-er.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.738
- Let's do this, come on.
- <i>( Clears throat )</i>

09:14.353 --> 09:16.388
Oh.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.557
Okay.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.492
- Just got to get a little...
- <i>( Basketball clunks )</i>

09:20.494 --> 09:22.695
Just got to get a little
warmed up, right, Bernie?

09:24.297 --> 09:25.530
( Stutters )

09:26.766 --> 09:29.434
I... I think you... uh...

09:29.436 --> 09:32.337
It's more of like a...
Like... like one hand.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.807
( Cheers )

09:35.809 --> 09:37.776
Yes!

09:37.778 --> 09:40.378
I hit the backboard.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.515
I am on fire.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.419
( Sighs ) Uh, Bernard?

09:47.421 --> 09:51.323
Thought you said
you played in college.

09:51.325 --> 09:55.860
In the national trash can
basketball association.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.533
We used to roll around
on office chairs

10:01.535 --> 10:03.668
and shoot up wadded-up paper.
Whoo.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.874
Uh, trash can basketball?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.610
- Yeah, trash can basketball.
- Oh.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.645
I won defensive player
of the year

10:13.647 --> 10:15.680
three years in a row.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.583
Yes, okay?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.485
I judged a book
by its cover.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.153
But come on!

10:22.155 --> 10:23.835
It was
a seven-foot book!

10:26.425 --> 10:28.126
Hey, mom.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.260
I'm so glad you're here.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.529
So I've been thinking
about this role

10:31.531 --> 10:33.198
and I think
I had it all wrong.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.267
She's not a haggard,
broken-down housewife.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.535
She's a super-mom

10:37.537 --> 10:39.657
who gets it all done
and looks great doing it.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.407
So to prepare
for that role,

10:42.409 --> 10:45.176
I think I know the perfect
person to talk to.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.446
( Chuckles )
That is... that is so sweet.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.649
Mrs. reifschneider,
my German teacher.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.221
The one with
the live-in housekeeper?

10:57.189 --> 10:59.891
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!

10:59.893 --> 11:03.495
Ask her.
Ask her.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.168
Liv, I have a huge problem.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.436
Uh, I'm listening.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.605
Okay, it's just the thing
with Bernard is...

11:13.607 --> 11:14.773
Uh, hold on.
Hold on.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.907
Mom!

11:15.909 --> 11:17.375
Huh?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.310
Do you mind?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.646
( In a deep voice )
More than you know.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.583
- Go on.
- Okay, I just...

11:25.585 --> 11:26.951
I thought Bernard
would be a better teammate,

11:26.953 --> 11:28.286
but he's terrible.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.454
Worse than dad?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.855
Way worse than dad.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.257
Are his shorts as bad?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.293
No shorts are that bad.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.594
( Mouths )

11:36.596 --> 11:37.862
But the point
is I'm not gonna

11:37.864 --> 11:39.230
win the tournament
with Bernard.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.598
So I need to figure out
a way to ditch him

11:40.600 --> 11:41.766
and get dad back.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.702
Why would you
want dad back?

11:43.704 --> 11:46.271
Because it's too late
to get anyone else...

11:47.940 --> 11:52.277
And because he's my father
and I love him.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.378
( Sighs )

11:53.380 --> 11:54.713
What am I gonna do?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.781
Oh, I think you know.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.516
Close your eyes
and let's visualize

11:58.518 --> 12:01.753
the best possible solution
to your problem.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.489
( Breathes deeply )

12:09.729 --> 12:11.996
Check it out.
I'm a fruit viking.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.666
( Screams )

12:23.976 --> 12:25.477
All right, Bernard.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.378
Now, I have set
a fitness goal for myself

12:27.380 --> 12:30.749
based on completely
reasonable expectations.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.384
I want you to make me

12:33.386 --> 12:36.554
into Joey 2.5.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.527
Uh, ah?
Nice, huh?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.462
I even have shoulders
bigger than yours.

12:44.464 --> 12:48.900
Nobody has shoulders
bigger than me.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.771
The only shoulder in the world
bigger than this one

12:52.773 --> 12:54.839
is this one.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.842
Sorry, but it's true.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.678
Okay, so what's
the plan for today?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.514
All right, Joey,
I want to determine

13:02.516 --> 13:03.715
- your target heart rate.
- ( Beeping )

13:03.717 --> 13:05.517
We're gonna do some squats,

13:05.519 --> 13:07.485
- some crunches,
- ( Beeps faster )

13:07.487 --> 13:10.421
- Then we're gonna jog a couple Miles.
- ( Rapid beeping )

13:10.423 --> 13:12.524
Ooh. ( Panting )

13:12.526 --> 13:14.659
What is that noise?

13:14.661 --> 13:17.061
Somehow, you've exceeded
your target heart rate

13:17.063 --> 13:21.399
by just listening to me
talk about exercise.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.469
So, we're done for the day.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.403
Whew, ha.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.905
Whoo.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.875
Joey, we haven't
even started yet.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.344
Now, get ready to sweat!

13:35.548 --> 13:37.382
Whoo!
( Laughs )

13:37.384 --> 13:39.984
This is fun.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.820
Plus, it's great cardio

13:41.822 --> 13:43.755
and it's easy
on the joints.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.523
Oh, easy,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.559
that is the word
I've been looking for.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.029
You can totally
blast your quads

13:51.031 --> 13:53.498
and get a great
core workout

13:53.500 --> 13:55.400
by just hopping
from side-to-side.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.402
( Laughs ) Nah, man.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.004
I'm good
just boinging in place.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.141
Joey 2.5
doesn't boing in place!

14:03.143 --> 14:05.743
No! Hey!
We're done.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.845
We're done.
You've made your point.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.047
- We're done.
- May I?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.049
Please do.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.084
( High-pitched scream )
No! Somebody!

14:13.086 --> 14:15.566
<i>Okay, we're done.</i>
<i>( Mimics laugh )</i>

14:18.057 --> 14:21.793
Hey, dad.
Can we talk?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.962
Sure.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.631
Since it went so well
the last time we did.

14:26.633 --> 14:31.436
Look, I made a mistake.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.572
I think I finally realized
that the whole point

14:34.574 --> 14:38.543
was for us to win
this tournament together.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.512
You're right.
That was the whole point.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.116
Well, back to practice.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.518
Really?
I'm gonna go get changed.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.754
Oh, no, no, no.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.989
Not with you...

14:51.957 --> 14:53.658
With my new teammate.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.498
Your new what-mate?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.634
- <i>( Basketball bounces )</i>
<i>- Diggy?</i>

15:04.770 --> 15:06.137
'Sup, Rooney?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.406
Oh, oh, oh.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.509
Both: Ohh!

15:11.511 --> 15:14.178
Told you prime-time Pete Rooney
would find his rhythm.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.915
Ring the alarm bells
'cause I'm on...

15:16.917 --> 15:20.818
¶ Fire.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.054
Wait, but I'm your daughter.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.756
How could you
do this to me?

15:24.758 --> 15:27.425
Because diggy knows
not to stab me in the back.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.495
Plus, he's a great player
with a solid jumper

15:30.497 --> 15:33.531
and impeccable fashion sense.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.199
( Gasps )

15:40.205 --> 15:43.441
( Hoarsely ) If you were trying
to psych-out your competition,

15:43.443 --> 15:44.575
mission accomplished.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.545
Ohh!

15:47.547 --> 15:49.213
( Continues exclaiming
indistinctly )

15:49.215 --> 15:51.015
( Both cheering )

15:55.087 --> 15:57.488
( Clears throat loudly )

15:58.657 --> 16:00.725
'Sup, diggy?

16:00.727 --> 16:03.861
Okay, before
you say anything,

16:03.863 --> 16:06.130
I'm sorry that
I teamed up with your dad...

16:07.132 --> 16:09.100
And that you had to see me
in those shorts.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.502
( Snorts )

16:11.504 --> 16:13.738
Relax, diggy.
I'm not upset with you.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.206
You're not?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.042
Wow, that's
really cool of you.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.211
You are being
really cool, right?

16:22.181 --> 16:24.716
- Way cool.
- Okay.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.484
( Sighs ) It's just...

16:26.486 --> 16:27.986
It's too bad though.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.154
Whoa, wait.
What's too bad?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.823
Oh, you know, it's just

16:31.825 --> 16:34.859
we're on different teams now
and so we're enemies.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.261
And I've sworn to crush
all my enemies!

16:37.263 --> 16:40.798
Are you saying that
I can't play

16:40.800 --> 16:45.169
( Laughs ) I would never
tell you what to do.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.005
- Okay.
- Hey, uh...

16:47.007 --> 16:49.107
Do you remember that one time
that we went ice skating

16:49.109 --> 16:50.174
and I got cold?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.676
Of course.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.978
It was the first time
we ever hung out together.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.515
- You were so cute.
- Yeah, here's the scarf that you loaned me.

17:00.219 --> 17:01.886
Okay, all right.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.154
I'm really getting
the feeling you're saying

17:03.156 --> 17:04.522
not to play
in that tournament.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.892
Pfft. ( Laughs )
I'm not saying anything.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.127
Here's a collection
of every single note

17:09.129 --> 17:10.128
that you've ever
left in my locker.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.863
Okay, okay.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.832
I get it.
I will, uh...

17:14.834 --> 17:16.534
I'll find a way
to get off your dad's team.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.238
I mean...

17:20.240 --> 17:22.273
If that's what
you really want.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.149
And I really want to play,
coach "r,"

17:31.151 --> 17:33.584
but, ugh, my arm
just hurts so bad.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.587
Cut down in my prime!

17:36.589 --> 17:39.624
It's a tough blow to team
short-shorts, isn't it, dad?

17:39.626 --> 17:42.026
It sure is.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.328
Let me ask you one question,
Mr. smalls.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.331
Would Maddie, by any chance,
be pressuring you...

17:47.333 --> 17:49.067
I don't know... to...

17:49.069 --> 17:51.235
Fake this?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.570
<i>Ha ha!</i>

17:52.572 --> 17:55.206
That girl's no good
for you, son.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.642
What... dad, you don't
even like diggy.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.677
That's not true.
He's a fine young man.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.413
- Really, sir?
- Stay out of it, diggy.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.049
- You leave diggy alone.
- No, I'm the basketball coach.

18:05.051 --> 18:08.319
- ( Indistinct arguing )
- You two, knock it off!

18:08.321 --> 18:11.622
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Okay, mom!

18:11.624 --> 18:13.291
Now, I don't know
who started this war,

18:13.293 --> 18:15.960
but I'm ending it.
Get in the kitchen.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.595
Now.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.230
Now!

18:20.833 --> 18:21.899
( Blows )

18:25.737 --> 18:27.371
Awesome! Yeah!

18:27.373 --> 18:30.675
I really want you to dig in
on this last session.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.743
I feel like I've made
a lot of progress.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.046
Progress?

18:35.048 --> 18:36.080
Sure.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.949
( Both snicker )

18:37.951 --> 18:39.650
( Laughing )

18:40.953 --> 18:42.386
( Laughs ) Progress.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.789
( Laughs ) He said progress.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.657
Okeydokey.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.260
Let's do this, bernasty.
( Laughs )

18:49.262 --> 18:52.063
Bern-who?

18:52.065 --> 18:55.399
Berna... you are not
ready for nicknames.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.202
- Not from you.
- Good one, tree top.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.304
Thanks, p-train.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.107
All right, Joseph.
This is simple.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.376
All you have to do
is run to me

19:05.378 --> 19:07.678
while fighting
those resistance bands.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.680
Oh, piece of cake.

19:09.682 --> 19:13.684
Everything
is not a dessert.

19:16.021 --> 19:19.157
Run to me as though
the walls are chasing you!

19:19.159 --> 19:22.059
Ooh, can I imagine a zombie?

19:22.061 --> 19:24.395
If you must.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.666
Come on, Joey.
Dig, Joey!

19:28.668 --> 19:30.234
All you have to do
is touch my hand

19:30.236 --> 19:32.436
and you'll be Joey 2.5.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.006
( Grunts )

19:35.008 --> 19:38.409
( Grunts )
Gaah! Ha ha!

19:38.411 --> 19:42.246
Whoo!
No one can stop me now!

19:42.248 --> 19:45.216
- ( Laughs )
- Buh-bye.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.318
- ( Screams )
- Both: Ooh.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.322
Hey, do you do
birthday parties?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.691
My pals will
really enjoy you.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.360
Any time, p-train.
Up top.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.729
( Grunts )

19:58.731 --> 20:00.131
<i>( Joey pants )</i>

20:00.133 --> 20:01.832
<i>Uh, guys.</i>

20:01.834 --> 20:04.335
Dudes?

20:04.337 --> 20:06.871
A little help over here,
tree top?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.307
<i>( Nervous laughter )</i>
<i>P-train?</i>

20:09.309 --> 20:10.908
Help me, bernasty!

20:10.910 --> 20:12.944
( Grunts )

20:13.950 --> 20:15.480
You two
are so stubborn.

20:15.481 --> 20:20.151
Can we at least agree there are
more important things than winning?

20:20.153 --> 20:22.486
( Both gasp )

20:22.488 --> 20:25.056
You two have been playing
basketball together

20:25.058 --> 20:26.324
since Maddie was five.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.260
wonderful thing you share
tear you apart?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.729
- She started it.
- He started it.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.332
I swear, it's like you two
are the same person.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.801
( Both gasp )

20:36.803 --> 20:38.002
I know, shocking.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.170
Now figure it out.

20:41.390 --> 20:42.307
It is possible

20:42.308 --> 20:46.344
that there are things more
important in life than winning?

20:46.346 --> 20:50.381
Doesn't seem right,
does it?

20:50.383 --> 20:53.384
I'm sorry
I dumped you, dad.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.287
I'm sorry
I dumped you back.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.258
Are we supposed
to hug now or something?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.459
I'd rather
go play basketball.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.861
- Let's play basketball.
- Yeah.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.198
Hey, listen, diggy.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.534
Um, Maddie and I
got back together.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.937
Beat it.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.139
That actually makes
this less awkward.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.208
I'm teaming up
with the big man.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.444
And if anyone's confused,

21:20.446 --> 21:22.513
I'm the big man.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.950
( Laughs )
Just a warning, diggy.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.386
That big man
is a big mistake.

21:28.388 --> 21:32.323
Bernard is a lot better
with his goggles.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.365
Whoo!

21:41.367 --> 21:43.200
Oh!
Oh!

21:43.202 --> 21:44.435
Ooh!
Oh!

21:44.437 --> 21:48.039
Bam!
What?!

21:48.041 --> 21:49.907
<i>Whoo!</i>

21:49.909 --> 21:54.078
I'm so much better when
I can actually see the hoop.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.814
Good luck
in the tournament,

21:56.816 --> 21:58.849
losers.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.287
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.455
Stop.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.166
Honey, I know
it was hard to lose

22:15.168 --> 22:17.068
the championship game
to diggy and Bernard,

22:17.070 --> 22:18.436
but the tournament's over.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.537
You need
to give it up, Pete.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.172
But we can win next year.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.540
No, no.
I meant your Daisy Dukes...

22:24.343 --> 22:27.845
'Cause no one wins
when you wear those.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.248
Hey, prime-time Pete Rooney's
been practicing a lot.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.583
He's got his groove back.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.485
He'd like you
to check this out.

22:36.955 --> 22:37.955
Oh-ho!

22:37.957 --> 22:40.491
In your face, old man!

22:40.493 --> 22:42.360
( Giggles )

22:42.362 --> 22:44.428
Exercise is fun.
