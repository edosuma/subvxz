00:09.342 --> 00:13.763
<i>Joshua Henry as Gaston,</i>

<i>and Leo Abelo Perry as Chip.</i>

00:31.322 --> 00:37.328
<i>Beauty and the Beast:</i>
<i>A 30th Celebration </i>starts now.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.693
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>in a faraway land,</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:11.654
<i>a young prince lived</i>
<i>in a shining castle.</i>

01:12.655 --> 01:15.575
<i>Although he had everything</i>
<i>his heart desired,</i>

01:15.867 --> 01:20.580
<i>the prince was spoiled, selfish,</i>
<i>and unkind.</i>

01:21.581 --> 01:23.833
<i>But then, one winter's night,</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:26.377
<i>an old beggar woman came</i>
<i>to the castle</i>

01:26.669 --> 01:29.506
<i>and offered him a single rose</i>

01:29.589 --> 01:32.634
<i>in return for shelter</i>
<i>from the bitter cold.</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:35.386
<i>Repulsed by</i>
<i>her haggard appearance,</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:40.183
<i>the prince sneered at the gift</i>
<i>and turned the old woman away.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:44.104
<i>But she warned him</i>
<i>not to be deceived by appearances,</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.065
<i>for beauty is found within.</i>

01:47.315 --> 01:49.192
<i>And when</i>
<i>he dismissed her again,</i>

01:49.275 --> 01:52.070
<i>the old woman's ugliness</i>
<i>melted away</i>

01:52.403 --> 01:55.448
<i>to reveal</i>
<i>a beautiful enchantress.</i>

01:56.199 --> 02:00.495
<i>The prince tried to apologize,</i>
<i>but it was too late, for she had seen</i>

02:00.578 --> 02:02.997
<i>that there was no love</i>
<i>in his heart.</i>

02:03.331 --> 02:04.374
<i>And as punishment,</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:06.960
<i>she transformed him</i>
<i>into a hideous beast</i>

02:07.043 --> 02:11.881
<i>and placed a powerful spell on the castle</i>
<i>and all who lived there.</i>

02:13.007 --> 02:15.176
<i>Ashamed of his monstrous form,</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:19.681
<i>the Beast concealed himself</i>
<i>inside his castle with a magic mirror</i>

02:19.764 --> 02:22.517
<i>as his only window</i>
<i>to the outside world.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:28.898
<i>The rose she had offered</i>
<i>was truly an enchanted rose,</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:31.818
<i>which would bloom</i>
<i>until his 21st year.</i>

02:32.569 --> 02:37.574
<i>If he could learn to love another</i>
<i>and earn her love in return</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:40.160
<i>by the time</i>
<i>the last petal fell,</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:43.037
<i>then the spell</i>
<i>would be broken.</i>

02:44.038 --> 02:49.711
<i>If not, he would be doomed</i>
<i>to remain a beast for all time.</i>

02:51.254 --> 02:52.922
<i>As the years passed,</i>

02:53.423 --> 02:57.844
<i>he fell into despair</i>
<i>and lost all hope,</i>

02:59.012 --> 03:03.224
<i>for who could ever learn</i>
<i>to love a beast?</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:34.672
Welcome, everyone,
to the 30th anniversary celebration

03:35.131 --> 03:41.512
of Walt Disney Animation Studios'
Oscar-winning, animated masterpiece,

03:41.721 --> 03:44.432
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

03:44.766 --> 03:47.185
You are in
for such a special treat

03:47.560 --> 03:51.397
as we present the animated movie
we all know and love

03:51.481 --> 03:55.777
with the musical numbers
reimagined

03:55.860 --> 03:59.239
as live-action spectacles.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.411
And for the Disney fan in all of us,
we are going to have

04:05.536 --> 04:08.831
some rare looks
behind the curtain,

04:09.040 --> 04:12.835
showing you just how
this classic film came to be

04:13.253 --> 04:16.297
from right here
on the Disney Studios backlot,

04:16.381 --> 04:20.885
where the inspiration first struck
to create this landmark film,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.179
one that has brought magic
into the lives

04:23.263 --> 04:26.349
of countless people
all around the globe.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.144
And that legacy began
on this very ground

04:30.478 --> 04:34.524
with an artist, an idea,
and a pencil.

05:01.843 --> 05:06.597
<i>Little town, it's a quiet village</i>

05:06.681 --> 05:11.477
<i>Every day like the one before</i>

05:11.561 --> 05:16.482
<i>Little town full of little people</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:21.654
<i>Waking up to say...</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:23.823
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

05:23.906 --> 05:25.616
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:29.662
<i>There goes the baker</i>
<i>With his tray like always</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:32.874
<i>The same old bread and rolls to sell</i>

05:33.207 --> 05:36.627
<i>Every morning, just the same</i>
<i>Since the morning that we came</i>

05:36.878 --> 05:38.546
<i>To this poor provincial town</i>

05:38.713 --> 05:40.381
-Good morning, Belle.
-Good morning, monsieur.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.300
-And where are you off to?
-The book shop.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.928
I just finished the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk and an ogre.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.182
That's nice. Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.601
<i>Look, there she goes</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:54.103
<i>That girl is strange, no question</i>

05:54.187 --> 05:57.357
<i>Dazed and distracted, can't you tell</i>

05:57.690 --> 05:59.359
<i>Never part of any crowd</i>

05:59.442 --> 06:01.194
<i>'Cause her head's up on some cloud</i>

06:01.277 --> 06:05.365
<i>No denying</i>
<i>She's a funny girl that Belle</i>

06:05.573 --> 06:07.325
-Bonjour
<i>-Good day</i>

06:07.492 --> 06:09.118
<i>How is your family</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:10.787
<i>-Bonjour</i>
<i>-Good day.</i>

06:11.079 --> 06:12.747
<i>How is your wife</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:16.376
<i>-I need six eggs</i>
<i>-That's too expensive</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:20.963
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:22.632
-Oh, Belle.
-Good morning.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.300
I've come to return
the book that I borrowed.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.677
-Finished already?
-Oh, I couldn't put it down.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.389
-Have you got anything new?
-Not since yesterday.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.266
Oh, that's all right.
I'll borrow this one.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.603
-That one? But you've read it twice.
-Well, it's my favorite.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.732
Far-off places, daring sword fights,
magic spells,

06:39.816 --> 06:44.237
-a prince in disguise.
-If you like it all that much, it's yours.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.072
-But madame...
-I insist.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.825
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.913
<i>Look, there she goes</i>
<i>That girl is so peculiar</i>

06:53.996 --> 06:57.291
<i>I wonder if she's feeling well</i>

06:57.375 --> 06:59.127
<i>With a dreamy, far-off look</i>

06:59.210 --> 07:01.003
<i>And her nose stuck in a book</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:05.299
<i>What a puzzle</i>
<i>To the rest of us is Belle</i>

07:05.383 --> 07:07.844
<i>Oh</i>

07:07.927 --> 07:11.764
<i>Isn't this amazing</i>

07:11.848 --> 07:14.600
<i>It's my favorite part</i>

07:14.684 --> 07:21.607
<i>Because you'll see</i>

07:21.899 --> 07:28.614
<i>Here's where she meets Prince Charming</i>

07:28.698 --> 07:33.161
<i>But she won't discover that it's him</i>

07:33.244 --> 07:38.166
<i>Till chapter three</i>

07:38.249 --> 07:41.919
<i>Now, it's no wonder</i>
<i>That her name means beauty</i>

07:42.003 --> 07:45.047
<i>Her looks have got no parallel</i>

07:45.339 --> 07:48.968
<i>But behind that fair façade</i>
<i>I'm afraid she's rather odd</i>

07:49.051 --> 07:50.720
<i>Very different from the rest of us</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:52.805
<i>She's nothing like the rest of us</i>

07:52.889 --> 07:54.557
<i>Yes, different from the rest of us</i>

07:54.640 --> 07:56.684
<i>Is Belle</i>

07:58.811 --> 08:02.482
Ah! Wow!
You didn't miss a shot, Gaston.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.442
You're the greatest hunter
in the whole world!

08:04.525 --> 08:05.443
I know.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.612
No beast stands a chance
against you...

08:07.737 --> 08:10.364
-or any girl, for that matter.
-That's right, LeFou,

08:10.448 --> 08:12.742
and I've got my sights set
on that one.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.118
The inventor's daughter?

08:14.285 --> 08:17.038
She's the one, the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.664
-But she's...
-The most beautiful girl in town!

08:18.831 --> 08:20.583
-I know!
-And that means she's the best.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.168
And don't I deserve the best?

08:22.251 --> 08:24.754
Of course.
I mean, you do, but I mean...

08:28.716 --> 08:32.595
<i>Right from the moment that I met her</i>
<i>Saw her</i>

08:32.678 --> 08:33.888
<i>I said, "She's gorgeous"</i>

08:34.013 --> 08:35.932
<i>-And I fell</i>

08:36.224 --> 08:39.894
<i>Here in town, there's only she</i>
<i>Who is beautiful as me</i>

08:39.977 --> 08:44.190
<i>So I'm making plans</i>
<i>To woo and marry Belle</i>

08:44.273 --> 08:47.860
<i>Look, there he goes</i>
<i>Isn't he dreamy</i>

08:47.944 --> 08:51.405
<i>Monsieur Gaston</i>
<i>Oh, he's so cute</i>

08:51.614 --> 08:54.909
<i>Be still, my heart</i>
<i>I'm hardly breathing</i>

08:54.992 --> 08:58.913
<i>He's such a tall, dark</i>
<i>Strong and handsome brute</i>

08:58.996 --> 08:59.914
-Bonjour.
-Pardon!

08:59.997 --> 09:00.957
-Good day.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.625
<i>You call this bacon</i>

09:02.750 --> 09:03.668
<i>-Some cheese.</i>
<i>-Ten yards.</i>

09:03.834 --> 09:04.877
<i>-One pound.</i>
<i>-Excuse me!</i>

09:04.961 --> 09:06.504
-I'll get the knife
-Please let me through

09:06.587 --> 09:07.713
<i>This bread, it's stale</i>

09:07.838 --> 09:08.881
<i>-This fish</i>
<i>-They smell</i>

09:08.965 --> 09:10.466
<i>-Madame's mistaken</i>
<i>-Well, maybe so</i>

09:10.591 --> 09:13.928
<i>There must be more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

09:14.011 --> 09:17.473
<i>Just watch</i>
<i>I'm going to make Belle my wife</i>

09:17.598 --> 09:18.724
<i>Look, there she goes</i>

09:18.808 --> 09:21.060
<i>That girl is strange, but special</i>

09:21.143 --> 09:24.397
<i>A most peculiar mademoiselle</i>

09:24.480 --> 09:26.274
<i>It's a pity and a sin</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:27.775
<i>She doesn't quite fit in</i>

09:28.401 --> 09:31.946
<i>'Cause she really is a funny girl</i>
<i>A beauty, but a funny girl</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:36.867
<i>She really is a funny girl</i>

09:36.951 --> 09:40.830
<i>That Belle</i>

09:40.913 --> 09:44.625
<i>That Belle</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:49.046
<i>That Belle</i>

10:01.309 --> 10:03.436
<i>Beauty and the Beast!</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:06.647
I'm a huge <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> fan.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.066
I've been listening to it
since I was a little kid.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.652
My first memory of seeing
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i>

10:11.736 --> 10:12.820
when it came out, I was ten.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.156
Most stories that touch your heart

10:15.239 --> 10:17.408
<i>when you're young,</i>
<i>you never want it to end,</i>

10:17.491 --> 10:20.411
<i>and that's why another incarnation</i>
<i>is always exciting.</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:21.954
-Ow.

10:22.079 --> 10:25.958
I think it's gonna be really fun, man.
Just look at the cast.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.918
Oh, my gosh,
I love Shania Twain.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.631
-Oh, my... Martin Short.
-H.E.R. is brilliant.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.759
DAVID:<i> What I like most about H.E.R.</i>
<i>is she plays guitar, and she's good.</i>

10:34.842 --> 10:37.803
<i>This is the dream team</i>
<i>to end all dream teams.</i>

10:37.928 --> 10:39.930
It's the party of a lifetime.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.850
It's gonna be really, really special.
I can't wait.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.658
One of my favorite parts
of tonight's celebration

10:58.866 --> 11:03.329
is the chance for all of us
to take a look behind the curtain

11:03.621 --> 11:08.709
and experience <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>
the same way the film's animators did

11:08.793 --> 11:11.295
when they first put pencil
to paper.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.089
So here,

11:13.714 --> 11:15.257
for the very first time,

11:15.758 --> 11:17.927
<i>is a scene</i>
<i>you will be familiar with,</i>

11:18.010 --> 11:22.014
<i>only in a way you have never</i>
<i>experienced it before.</i>

11:25.976 --> 11:27.645
-MAURICE:<i> This is it, Belle!</i>

11:27.728 --> 11:29.397
<i>This time is it!</i>

11:29.730 --> 11:32.316
<i>I'll win first prize</i>
<i>at the fair this year.</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:36.195
<i>Oh, Papa, it works!</i>

11:36.487 --> 11:38.739
<i>-You did it!</i>

11:38.823 --> 11:40.241
<i>I always knew you were a genius!</i>

11:40.449 --> 11:43.494
MAURICE:<i> Well, I don't know</i>
<i>if I'd qualify as a...</i>

11:43.577 --> 11:45.204
-BELLE:<i> You'd better hurry.</i>

11:45.287 --> 11:46.372
<i>It's a long ride to the fair.</i>

11:46.539 --> 11:48.124
<i>Goodbye, Papa! Good luck!</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:51.043
<i>Goodbye, Belle!</i>
<i>Take care while I'm gone!</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:57.258
-I should be there by now.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.719
-Maybe we missed a turn.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.472
I guess I should have taken the...
wait a minute.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.017
Come on, Philippe.
It's a shortcut.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.445
-This can't be right.

12:17.528 --> 12:21.282
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.494
Steady.
Oh, no, Philippe!

12:25.578 --> 12:26.787
Oh, no.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.960
-Who's there?

12:34.503 --> 12:35.671
Is someone there?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.136
Show yourself at once!

12:44.805 --> 12:45.723
Oh, dear!

12:47.475 --> 12:49.018
Shoo! Help!

12:49.560 --> 12:51.145
Philippe, help me!

12:51.228 --> 12:52.688
They're gonna eat me!

12:58.527 --> 12:59.570
Stay!

13:00.070 --> 13:02.531
Oh, my!
Oh, no, no!

13:09.872 --> 13:12.249
Let's all calm down.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.919
Oh, dear. Enough.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.924
Help! Is someone there?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.310
-What?

13:44.448 --> 13:46.909
What is... Oh...

13:53.082 --> 13:54.124
Hello?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.504
Hello?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.798
Poor fellow must have
lost his way in the woods.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.884
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.345
Is someone there?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.849
Not a word, Lumière,
not one word.

14:10.099 --> 14:14.854
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse, and...

14:14.937 --> 14:17.231
and I need a place to stay
for the night.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.401
-Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
-Shh!

14:22.278 --> 14:24.405
-Ah, ah, ah, ow!
-Oh, of course, monsieur,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.824
-you are welcome here.
-Who said that?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.785
-Over here!
-Where?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.079
-Hello.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.793
-How is this accomplished?
-Put me down at once.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.170
Stop that.
Stop that, I say.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.090
Oh, you are soaked
to the bone, monsieur.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.218
-Come, warm yourself by the fire.
-<i>Thank you.</i>

14:46.510 --> 14:48.637
COGSWORTH:<i> No, no, no.</i>

14:48.721 --> 14:50.764
<i>You know what the master</i>
<i>will do if he finds him here.</i>

14:50.848 --> 14:53.225
I demand that you stop
right there.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.938
-Well, hello there, boy.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.737
What service.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.697
-All right...

15:06.822 --> 15:09.199
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.701
It'll warm you up in no time.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.996
No. No tea. No tea!

15:16.582 --> 15:19.126
His mustache tickles, Mama!

15:19.209 --> 15:21.587
Oh!
Hello.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.177
-Uh-oh.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.229
-There's a stranger here.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.023
Master, allow me to explain.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.691
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.151
-He was cold and wet, so...

15:47.112 --> 15:50.157
Mm, Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say

15:50.616 --> 15:51.951
I was against this
from the start.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.619
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.912
Would they listen to me?
No, no...

15:57.957 --> 15:58.999
Is that...

16:00.542 --> 16:02.127
-Who are you?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.295
What are you doing here?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.798
I-I-I was lost
in the woods, and...

16:05.881 --> 16:09.301
-You are not welcome here!
-I-I-I'm sorry.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.179
-What are you staring at?
-N-nothing.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.766
So you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?

16:15.891 --> 16:19.603
Please! I meant no harm!
I-I just needed a place to stay.

16:19.687 --> 16:24.400
-I'll give you a place to stay.
-No, no, please! No, no!

16:39.081 --> 16:41.667
Gaston.
What a pleasant surprise.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.878
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.214
You know, Belle,
there's not a girl in town

16:47.297 --> 16:49.299
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.469
This is the day... hmm...

16:52.553 --> 16:55.180
-Ah. This is the day

16:55.347 --> 16:56.849
your dreams come true.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.852
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.521
Plenty. Here, picture this.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.149
A rustic hunting lodge.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.027
My latest kill
roasting on the fire.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.655
And my little wife
massaging my feet,

17:12.197 --> 17:14.491
while the little ones play on the floor
with the dogs.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.201
We'll have six or seven.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.328
-Dogs?
-No, Belle.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.040
-Strapping boys, like me.
-Imagine that.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.916
And do you know
who that little wife will be?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.793
-Let me think.
-You, Belle.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.837
Gaston, I'm... I'm...

17:27.671 --> 17:28.589
speechless.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.966
I really don't know
what to say.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.553
-Say you'll marry me.
-I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

17:35.596 --> 17:38.515
but I just don't deserve you.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.100
-Whoa!

17:46.106 --> 17:49.068
So how'd it go?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.695
I'll have Belle for my wife.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.948
-Make no mistake about that.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.910
-Touchy.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.871
" PLAYING)

18:02.706 --> 18:05.793
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.421
Me, the wife
of that boorish, brainless...

18:09.963 --> 18:13.675
<i>Madame Gaston</i>
<i>Can't you just see it</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:17.554
<i>Madame Gaston, his little wife</i>

18:17.638 --> 18:21.141
<i>No, sir, not me, I guarantee it</i>

18:21.225 --> 18:25.437
<i>I want much more</i>
<i>Than this provincial life</i>

18:39.076 --> 18:43.997
<i>I want adventure</i>
<i>In the great wide, somewhere</i>

18:44.081 --> 18:48.085
<i>I want it more than I can tell</i>

19:56.486 --> 19:59.781
<i>And for once, it might be grand</i>

20:00.073 --> 20:04.036
<i>To have someone understand</i>

20:07.456 --> 20:09.541
<i>I want so much more</i>

20:09.625 --> 20:13.337
<i>Than they've got planned</i>

20:33.232 --> 20:34.483
Hello, hello.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.693
Now we are getting
into character, eh?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.321
Besides, they must
fall in love tonight

20:39.404 --> 20:41.240
if we ever expect
to be human again.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.243
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.203
-Philippe!

20:46.370 --> 20:48.747
-What are you doing here? Where's...

20:48.914 --> 20:49.957
Where's Papa?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.626
Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?

20:53.001 --> 20:55.629
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.520
What is this place?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.649
Philippe, please. Steady.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.652
Steady.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.448
<i>Papa...</i>

21:26.159 --> 21:27.160
Hello?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.123
Is anyone here?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.960
Papa, are you here?

21:36.795 --> 21:38.005
Did you see that?

21:38.088 --> 21:41.049
-It's a girl!
-Yes, I can see it's a girl.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.176
But don't you see?
She's the one!

21:43.260 --> 21:45.721
The girl we've been waiting for.
She's come to break the spell.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.931
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.059
Didn't you invite the last guest in?
And you-know-who was furious.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.728
Why are you getting
so wound up?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.439
You're the one who keeps saying,
"Oh, all this waiting is making me

21:55.564 --> 21:57.941
go cuckoo, cuckoo."

21:58.608 --> 21:59.735
Clock jokes?

22:00.694 --> 22:02.738
Really, Lumière? You must have

22:02.821 --> 22:04.656
burned the candle at both ends,
coming up with those.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.658
Come on. The clock is ticking.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.536
Oh, that's clever.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.038
My, you're a thinker.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.332
I would never have thought
you could do that.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.047
Papa?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.215
Belle?

22:23.050 --> 22:27.012
Oh, you must leave here at once.
Now, go before he finds you.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.432
-Who?
-What are you doing here?

22:30.766 --> 22:33.310
-Run, Belle.
-I've come for my father.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.270
-Please let him out.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.772
Can't you see he's sick?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.149
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.527
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.446
There must be some way I can...

22:45.405 --> 22:46.615
-Wait.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.825
Take me instead.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.329
You... would take his place?

22:52.579 --> 22:55.332
Belle, no.
You don't know what you're doing.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.584
If I agree,

22:58.627 --> 23:02.255
you must promise to stay here
forever.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.759
Come into the light.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.231
Belle. I won't let you do this.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.362
You have my word.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.364
Done.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.324
No, Belle!

23:34.246 --> 23:36.873
No, please spare my daughter.
Please!

23:36.957 --> 23:38.625
She's no longer your concern.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.460
-Take him to the village.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.046
Let me out!
Please let me out!

23:43.380 --> 23:46.174
Let me out, please!

23:46.758 --> 23:47.843
Please!

23:49.136 --> 23:51.138
You didn't even let me
say goodbye.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.140
I'll never see him again.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.934
And I didn't get
to say goodbye.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.439
-I'll show you to your room.
-My room?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.232
But I thought...

24:02.482 --> 24:04.526
You wanna...
you wanna stay in the tower?

24:04.609 --> 24:06.111
-No.
-Then follow me.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.375
Say something to her.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.003
Huh? Oh. I...

24:23.920 --> 24:25.338
hope you like it here.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.510
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

24:30.635 --> 24:32.137
except the west wing.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.264
-What's in the west...
-It's forbidden!

24:41.605 --> 24:42.939
Now, if you need anything,

24:43.440 --> 24:45.066
my servants will attend you.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.568
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.113
You will join me for dinner.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.364
That's not a request!

25:17.891 --> 25:19.267
Who does she think she is?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.394
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man!

25:22.020 --> 25:25.482
-No one says no to Gaston.
-Darn right.

25:25.941 --> 25:30.320
Dismissed, rejected,
publicly humiliated!

25:30.654 --> 25:33.114
-It's more than I can bear.
-More beer?

25:33.198 --> 25:35.158
What for? Nothing helps.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.663
-I'm disgraced.
-Who, you? Never!

25:39.913 --> 25:42.499
Gaston, you gotta
pull yourself together.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.501
<i>-Gosh, it disturbs me</i>

25:44.584 --> 25:46.002
<i>To see you, Gaston</i>

25:46.127 --> 25:48.505
<i>Looking so down in the dumps</i>

25:48.755 --> 25:50.924
-<i>Every guy here'd love</i>

25:51.132 --> 25:55.178
<i>To be you, Gaston,</i>
<i>even when taking your lumps</i>

25:55.804 --> 25:58.723
<i>There's no man in town</i>
<i>As admired as you</i>

25:58.932 --> 26:01.393
<i>You're everyone's favorite guy</i>

26:02.435 --> 26:05.480
<i>Everyone's awed and inspired by you</i>

26:05.814 --> 26:09.234
<i>And it's not very hard</i>

26:09.317 --> 26:12.696
<i>To see why</i>

26:14.531 --> 26:19.119
<i>-No one's slick as Gaston</i>

26:19.202 --> 26:20.620
<i>No one's quick as Gaston</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:23.873
<i>No one's neck's as incredibly</i>
<i>Thick as Gaston's</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:27.627
<i>For there's no man in town</i>
<i>Half as manly... </i>

26:27.794 --> 26:30.422
<i>Perfect, a pure paragon</i>

26:30.547 --> 26:33.675
<i>You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley</i>

26:33.800 --> 26:37.804
<i>And they'll tell you whose team</i>
<i>They prefer to be on</i>

26:39.347 --> 26:43.768
<i>No one's big like Gaston</i>

26:43.852 --> 26:45.353
<i>A kingpin like Gaston</i>

26:45.562 --> 26:48.189
<i>No one's got a swell cleft</i>
<i>In his chin like Gaston</i>

26:48.648 --> 26:52.569
<i>As a specimen, yes,</i>
<i>I'm intimidating</i>

26:52.986 --> 26:55.488
<i>My what a guy that Gaston</i>

26:55.655 --> 26:58.908
<i>Give five hurrahs, give 12 hip-hips</i>

26:58.992 --> 27:00.660
<i>Gaston is the best</i>

27:00.744 --> 27:03.622
<i>-And the rest is all drips</i>
-Yeah. Oh.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.752
ALL:
<i>No one fights like Gaston</i>

27:08.835 --> 27:10.462
<i>Douses lights like Gaston</i>

27:10.670 --> 27:14.174
<i>In a wrestling match</i>
<i>Nobody fights like Gaston</i>

27:14.257 --> 27:17.218
<i>For there's no one as burly and brawny</i>

27:17.302 --> 27:19.929
<i>As you see I've got biceps to spare</i>

27:20.639 --> 27:23.350
<i>Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny</i>

27:23.433 --> 27:24.392
That's right!

27:24.559 --> 27:27.646
<i>And every last inch of me's</i>
<i>Covered with hair</i>

27:27.729 --> 27:30.815
<i>No one hits like Gaston</i>
<i>Matches wits like Gaston</i>

27:30.899 --> 27:34.027
<i>In a spitting match,</i>
<i>Nobody spits like Gaston</i>

27:34.110 --> 27:37.530
<i>I'm especially good at expectorating</i>

27:37.739 --> 27:40.825
-Ptooey!
-ALL:<i> Ten points for Gaston</i>

27:41.076 --> 27:43.912
<i>When I was a lad,</i>
<i>I ate four dozen eggs</i>

27:44.037 --> 27:46.706
<i>Every morning to help me get large</i>

27:47.749 --> 27:50.585
<i>And now that I'm grown</i>
<i>I eat five dozen eggs</i>

27:50.960 --> 27:57.926
<i>So I'm roughly the size</i>
<i>Of a barge</i>

28:31.209 --> 28:34.838
<i>No one shoots like Gaston</i>

28:35.088 --> 28:36.339
-No one!
-<i>Makes those beauts</i>

28:36.423 --> 28:38.508
<i>-Like Gaston</i>
<i>-Then goes tromping around</i>

28:38.675 --> 28:40.427
<i>Wearing boots like Gaston</i>

28:40.552 --> 28:44.472
<i>I use antlers</i>
<i>In all of my decorating</i>

28:44.556 --> 28:46.725
<i>My what a guy</i>

28:47.016 --> 28:52.981
<i>Gaston</i>

29:00.029 --> 29:03.825
Help! Someone help me!
He's got her.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.077
He's got her locked
in a dungeon.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.705
Oh, we must go.
Not a minute to lose!

29:08.830 --> 29:10.582
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Maurice.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.917
-Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
-A beast!

29:13.334 --> 29:16.296
A horrible, monstrous beast!

29:19.090 --> 29:21.509
My daughter's life is in danger.
Why do you laugh?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.679
The Beast is real!

29:25.263 --> 29:26.473
Will no one help me?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.892
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.811
Oh, you will?
Oh, thank you. Oh. Thank you.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.189
Thank you.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.524
-Crazy old Maurice.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.318
He's always good for a laugh.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.154
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

29:41.404 --> 29:43.156
Crazy old Maurice.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.949
Hmm...

29:48.578 --> 29:51.164
<i>-LeFou, I'm afraid I've been thinking</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:53.625
A dangerous pastime.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.001
-I know.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.129
<i>But that wacky old coot is Belle's father</i>

29:58.713 --> 30:01.299
<i>And his sanity's only so-so</i>

30:01.800 --> 30:04.886
<i>Now the wheels in my head</i>
<i>Have been turning</i>

30:05.136 --> 30:08.139
<i>-Since I looked at that loony old man</i>

30:08.306 --> 30:11.684
<i>See, I promised myself</i>
<i>I'd be married to Belle</i>

30:11.851 --> 30:15.855
<i>And right now</i>
<i>I'm evolving a plan</i>

30:17.565 --> 30:18.566
-If I...
-Yes?

30:18.691 --> 30:19.692
-Then we...
-No, will she?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.569
-Yes.
-Now I get it.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.531
Let's go!

30:25.532 --> 30:29.494
<i>No one plots like Gaston</i>

30:29.577 --> 30:31.204
<i>Takes cheap shots like Gaston</i>

30:31.287 --> 30:34.666
<i>Plans to persecute harmless</i>
<i>Crackpots like Gaston</i>

30:34.749 --> 30:40.505
<i>So his marriage</i>
<i>We soon will be celebrating</i>

30:40.588 --> 30:47.470
<i>My, what a guy, Gaston</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:55.687
Hmm?

31:10.159 --> 31:13.663
There has to be some way
we can cheer up Belle.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.584
-Help her see the bright side.
-I've got it!

31:19.252 --> 31:21.379
Why don't you show her
your little TikTok dance?

31:21.462 --> 31:22.881
That always cheers me up.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.924
It's not a dance.
It's the way I walk.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.926
And tick-tock is the sound
I make when I move.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.094
Ah.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.642
Oh, I'm suddenly happy.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.233
-Who is it?
-MRS. POTTS: Mrs. Potts, dear.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.612
-I thought you might like...

31:45.695 --> 31:47.363
-A spot of tea.
-But you're...

31:47.614 --> 31:50.158
-you're a...
-Oh!

31:50.283 --> 31:52.368
-Careful.
-This is impossible.

31:52.702 --> 31:55.330
I know it is, but here we are.

31:55.538 --> 31:57.916
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.459
We all think so.

31:59.584 --> 32:03.129
But I've lost my father,
my dreams, everything.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.923
Cheer up, child.

32:05.465 --> 32:09.010
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.220
Oh, listen to me, jabbering on

32:11.304 --> 32:13.222
while there's a supper
to get on the table.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.307
Chip!

32:15.433 --> 32:16.517
Bye!

32:16.726 --> 32:19.520
What's taking so long?

32:20.063 --> 32:23.441
I told her to come down.
Why isn't she here yet?

32:23.691 --> 32:25.276
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.863
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom all in one day.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.908
Master, have you thought
that perhaps this girl

32:31.991 --> 32:34.661
-could be the one to break the spell?
-Of course I have!

32:35.036 --> 32:36.955
-I'm not a fool.
-Good.

32:37.246 --> 32:40.792
So you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you,

32:40.875 --> 32:42.752
and poof, the spell is broken.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.754
We'll be human again
by midnight.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.757
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumière.
These things take time.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.968
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.678
Oh, it's no use.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.138
She's so beautiful, and I'm...

32:54.889 --> 32:55.974
well, look at me!

32:58.393 --> 33:01.104
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

33:01.437 --> 33:02.522
I don't know how.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.067
Well, you can start by making yourself
more presentable.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.361
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.

33:08.444 --> 33:12.156
Ah, yes. When she comes in,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

33:12.615 --> 33:13.992
Come, come. Show me the smile.

33:14.742 --> 33:19.122
-But don't frighten the poor girl.
-Impress her with your rapier wit.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.289
But be gentle.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.792
-Shower her with compliments.
-MRS. POTTS: But be sincere.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.168
And above all...

33:24.335 --> 33:26.379
You must control your temper.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.589
-Here she is.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.010
Good evening.

33:33.302 --> 33:34.804
Well? Where is she?

33:35.972 --> 33:36.931
What?

33:37.640 --> 33:40.393
<i>But Your Grace, Your Eminence...</i>

33:41.102 --> 33:42.687
<i>let's not be hasty!</i>

33:45.523 --> 33:47.275
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.568
I'm not hungry.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.697
You'll come out, or I'll...
I'll... I'll break down the door!

33:53.072 --> 33:55.575
Master, I could be wrong,
but, uh...

33:55.658 --> 33:59.162
That may not be the best way
to win the girl's affections.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.707
Please, attempt to be a gentleman.

34:02.915 --> 34:06.085
It would give me
great pleasure

34:07.128 --> 34:08.921
if you would join me
for dinner.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.048
We say please.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.508
-Please.
-No, thank you.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.218
You can't stay in there forever.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.220
-Yes, I can.
-Fine!

34:16.304 --> 34:19.599
Then go ahead and starve!

34:19.766 --> 34:21.601
If she doesn't eat with me,

34:22.143 --> 34:23.936
then she doesn't eat at all.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.566
-Oh, dear.

34:28.691 --> 34:30.276
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

34:32.487 --> 34:35.114
What does she want me to do? Beg?

34:41.537 --> 34:42.830
Show me the girl.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.793
<i>But the master's really not so bad</i>
<i>once you get to know him.</i>

34:47.210 --> 34:49.087
<i>Why don't you give him</i>
<i>a chance?</i>

34:49.295 --> 34:50.922
<i>I don't want to get to know him.</i>

34:51.130 --> 34:53.257
<i>I don't want to have</i>
<i>anything to do with him.</i>

34:55.968 --> 34:57.887
I'm just fooling myself.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.141
She'll never see me as anything
but a monster.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
It's hopeless.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.656
The falling petals
of an enchanted rose,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.326
each one a graceful reminder

36:43.451 --> 36:47.288
that love is as fragile
as it is enduring,

36:47.705 --> 36:52.460
as difficult to find
as it is a wonder to hold onto.

36:53.002 --> 36:56.047
That true love can overcome
any obstacles

36:56.130 --> 36:59.300
no matter how impossible
they may seem.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.596
<i>It is this idea that inspired</i>
<i>Walt Disney himself</i>

37:03.679 --> 37:06.766
<i>to want to tell the story</i>
<i>of </i>Beauty and the Beast

37:06.849 --> 37:09.143
<i>as far back as the 1930s.</i>

37:10.186 --> 37:15.024
<i>For decades, Disney artists worked</i>
<i>to adapt this tale as old as time,</i>

37:15.149 --> 37:18.527
<i>yet something was always missing</i>
<i>from these early efforts.</i>

37:18.945 --> 37:23.157
<i>Then, more than 50 years</i>
<i>after inspiration first struck,</i>

37:23.241 --> 37:28.496
<i>a team came together that was just</i>
<i>as special as the fairy tale itself.</i>

37:28.746 --> 37:30.831
<i>Dancing again, we'll be twirling again</i>

37:30.915 --> 37:31.874
-Yeah.
-Want that faster?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.252
-Yeah.
<i>-Composer Alan Menken,</i>

37:34.418 --> 37:35.920
<i>lyricist Howard Ashman,</i>

37:36.003 --> 37:38.381
<i>and the team at Walt Disney</i>
<i>Animation Studios</i>

37:38.464 --> 37:41.217
<i>found the missing spark.</i>

37:41.509 --> 37:46.305
<i>Together with Linda Woolverton,</i>
<i>the first woman ever to write</i>

37:46.389 --> 37:50.017
<i>an animated feature for Disney,</i>
<i>they brought the story to life</i>

37:50.101 --> 37:53.437
<i>not simply through words,</i>
<i>but through music,</i>

37:53.604 --> 37:57.525
<i>and were finally able to deliver</i>
<i>on Walt Disney's dream.</i>

37:57.817 --> 38:00.736
<i>Roy Disney himself wrote</i>
<i>the film's prologue.</i>

38:00.820 --> 38:03.489
<i>Together, they embraced</i>
<i>all the joy</i>

38:03.572 --> 38:06.409
<i>of Belle becoming the hero</i>
<i>of her own story...</i>

38:06.534 --> 38:09.245
I want excitement
and adventure in my life.

38:09.912 --> 38:12.039
And I want someone
to share it with.

38:12.206 --> 38:16.043
<i>And the magic of the Beast</i>
<i>and his enchanted castle.</i>

38:16.585 --> 38:18.379
Beauty and the Beast <i>has become</i>

38:18.462 --> 38:23.050
one of the most beloved
animated classics ever made.

38:23.592 --> 38:27.763
It was even
the first animated film ever

38:27.847 --> 38:31.475
to be nominated for Best Picture
at the Academy Awards.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.811
And to this day,

38:34.645 --> 38:39.233
Walt Disney's original idea
continues to inspire us all.

38:48.951 --> 38:52.204
<i>Come on, Chip, into the cupboard</i>
<i>with your brothers and sisters.</i>

38:54.040 --> 38:56.959
-But I'm not sleepy.
-Yes, you are.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.836
-No, I'm not.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.964
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.632
After all, he did say "please."

39:03.716 --> 39:06.510
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper,

39:06.594 --> 39:08.929
-He'll never break...
-Splendid to see you

39:09.013 --> 39:10.222
out and about, mademoiselle.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.142
I am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.061
-Ah.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.481
-This is Lumière.
<i>-Enchanté, chérie.</i>

39:18.814 --> 39:22.526
If there's... stop that...
anything we... please... can do

39:22.610 --> 39:24.195
to make your stay
more comfortable...

39:24.278 --> 39:25.279
-Ow!

39:25.404 --> 39:27.573
-I am a little hungry.
-You are?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.367
Hear that? She's hungry.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.495
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.

39:32.828 --> 39:35.081
Remember what the master said?

39:35.247 --> 39:38.417
Oh, pish-posh. I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

39:38.584 --> 39:39.877
All right, fine.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.504
Glass of water, crust of bread,
and then...

39:41.629 --> 39:43.964
Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.634
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.761
We must make her feel
welcome here.

39:48.969 --> 39:52.139
-Right this way, mademoiselle.
-Well, keep it down.

39:52.556 --> 39:54.934
If the master finds out about this,
it will be our necks.

39:55.017 --> 39:56.560
Of course, of course.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.772
But what is dinner
without a little music?

40:00.147 --> 40:01.482
-Music?

40:03.859 --> 40:05.820
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle,</i>

40:05.903 --> 40:08.864
it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

40:09.031 --> 40:11.867
that we welcome you
here tonight.

40:12.284 --> 40:16.122
And now we invite you
to relax and to pull up a chair

40:16.205 --> 40:21.419
as the dining room
proudly presents your dinner.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.715
<i>Be our guest</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:30.136
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Put our service to the test</i>

40:30.344 --> 40:34.557
<i>Tie a napkin 'round your neck, chérie</i>
<i>And we'll provide the rest</i>

40:35.015 --> 40:37.518
<i>Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres</i>

40:37.601 --> 40:39.562
<i>Why, we only live to serve</i>

40:39.645 --> 40:41.814
<i>Try the gray stuff, it's delicious</i>

40:41.897 --> 40:43.732
<i>Don't believe me</i>
<i>Ask the dishes</i>

40:43.899 --> 40:48.821
<i>They can sing, they can dance</i>
<i>After all, miss, this is France</i>

40:48.904 --> 40:52.825
<i>And a dinner here is never second best</i>

40:52.908 --> 40:55.161
<i>Go on, unfold your menu</i>

40:55.244 --> 40:58.330
<i>Take a glance</i>
<i>And then you'll be our guest</i>

40:58.622 --> 41:01.417
Oui,<i> our guest, be our guest</i>

41:01.792 --> 41:06.213
<i>Beef ragout, cheese soufflé</i>
<i>Pie and pudding en flambé</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:10.509
<i>We'll prepare and serve with flair</i>
<i>A culinary cabaret</i>

41:10.593 --> 41:14.889
<i>You're alone and you're scared</i>
<i>But the banquet's all prepared</i>

41:14.972 --> 41:19.435
<i>No one's gloomy or complaining</i>
<i>While the flatware is entertaining</i>

41:19.727 --> 41:23.439
<i>We tell jokes, I do tricks</i>
<i>With my fellow candlesticks</i>

41:23.522 --> 41:27.318
<i>And it's all in perfect taste</i>
<i>That you can bet</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:29.403
<i>Come on and lift your glass</i>

41:29.487 --> 41:31.655
<i>You've won your own free pass</i>

41:31.739 --> 41:33.157
<i>To be our guest</i>

41:33.240 --> 41:35.993
<i>If you're stressed</i>
<i>It's fine dining we suggest</i>

41:36.118 --> 41:39.872
<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>Be our guest, be our guest</i>

41:41.457 --> 41:43.876
<i>Life is so unnerving</i>

41:44.084 --> 41:46.420
<i>For a servant who's not serving</i>

41:46.545 --> 41:50.090
<i>He's not whole without a soul to wait upon</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:55.638
<i>Oh, those good old days</i>
<i>When we were useful</i>

41:56.430 --> 41:59.517
<i>Suddenly those good old days are gone</i>

42:01.101 --> 42:05.356
<i>Ten years we've been rusting</i>
<i>Needing so much more than dusting</i>

42:05.689 --> 42:09.568
<i>Needing exercise</i>
<i>A chance to use our skills</i>

42:11.111 --> 42:15.449
<i>Most days we just lay</i>
<i>Around the castle</i>

42:15.824 --> 42:19.828
<i>Flabby, fat, and lazy</i>
<i>You walked in and oopsie-daisy</i>

42:20.788 --> 42:22.623
<i>Ma cheré mademoiselle,</i>

42:22.706 --> 42:26.168
it is my honor to present
my favorite cup of tea,

42:26.418 --> 42:28.963
the incomparable Mrs. Potts.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.215
<i>It's a guest, it's a guest</i>

42:31.382 --> 42:32.800
<i>Sakes alive and I'll be blessed</i>

42:33.217 --> 42:34.927
<i>Wine's been poured</i>
<i>And thank the Lord</i>

42:35.094 --> 42:36.929
<i>I've had the napkins freshly pressed</i>

42:37.096 --> 42:40.516
<i>With dessert, she'll want tea</i>
<i>And my dear, that's fine with me</i>

42:40.808 --> 42:44.770
<i>While the cups do their soft-shoein'</i>
<i>I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'</i>

42:44.853 --> 42:48.524
<i>I'll get warm, piping hot</i>
<i>Heaven's sakes, is that a spot</i>

42:48.691 --> 42:52.027
<i>Clean it up,</i>
<i>We want the company impressed</i>

42:52.194 --> 42:56.031
<i>We've got a lot to do</i>
<i>Is it one lump or two</i>

42:56.198 --> 42:57.700
<i>For you, our guest</i>

42:57.783 --> 42:59.493
<i>-She's our guest</i>
<i>-Oh, she's our guest</i>

42:59.577 --> 43:02.037
-<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest, be our guest</i>

43:02.162 --> 43:03.789
<i>Our command is your request</i>

43:03.956 --> 43:07.543
<i>It's been years since we've had</i>
<i>Anybody here and we're obsessed</i>

43:07.710 --> 43:11.463
<i>With your meal, with your ease</i>
<i>Yes, indeed we aim to please</i>

43:11.589 --> 43:14.466
<i>While candlelight's still glowing</i>

43:14.550 --> 43:19.263
<i>Let us help you, we'll keep going</i>

43:19.346 --> 43:22.641
<i>Course by course</i>

43:23.642 --> 43:25.352
<i>One by one</i>

43:25.894 --> 43:28.230
<i>Till you shout, enough, I'm done</i>

43:28.355 --> 43:31.942
<i>Then we'll sing you</i>
<i>Off to sleep as you digest</i>

43:32.484 --> 43:36.238
<i>Tonight you'll prop your feet up</i>
<i>But for now, let's eat up</i>

43:36.405 --> 43:37.615
<i>-Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>

43:37.823 --> 43:39.742
-<i>Be our guest</i>
<i>-Be our guest</i>

43:39.908 --> 43:40.951
<i>Be our guest</i>

43:41.493 --> 43:47.625
<i>Please, be our guest</i>

43:59.845 --> 44:02.306
Bravo.
That was wonderful.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.601
Thank you, mademoiselle.
It was wonderful. Wasn't it, everyone?

44:07.686 --> 44:11.565
Will you look at the time?
Off to bed, off to bed.

44:12.441 --> 44:15.361
I'd like to look around.
Perhaps you'd like to take me?

44:15.611 --> 44:18.822
I'm sure you know everything
there is to know about the castle.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.908
Well, actually, yes, I do.

44:23.619 --> 44:24.995
Right this way.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.623
-As you can see...

44:27.706 --> 44:32.336
The pseudo façade was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist Rococo design.

44:32.544 --> 44:33.837
-Note the unusual...

44:33.921 --> 44:35.297
...inverted vaulted ceilings.

44:35.464 --> 44:39.009
This is yet another example
of the late neoclassic Baroque period.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.638
And as I always say,
if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.100
Mm. Uh, where was I?

44:47.643 --> 44:49.561
-As you were.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.939
Now then, if I may draw
your attention

44:52.022 --> 44:54.191
to the flying buttresses
above the...

44:54.692 --> 44:55.943
uh, mademoiselle?

45:01.782 --> 45:04.118
-What's up there?
-Where? There? Oh, nothing.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.328
Absolutely nothing of interest
at all in the west wing.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.497
Dusty, dull, very boring.

45:09.164 --> 45:11.458
Ah, so that's the west wing.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.086
-Nice going.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.297
-I wonder what he's hiding up there.
-Hiding?

45:17.381 --> 45:19.216
The...the master
is hiding nothing.

45:19.341 --> 45:20.634
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.679
Perhaps, uh, mademoiselle
would like to, uh, uh,

45:23.762 --> 45:25.013
uh, see something else?

45:25.264 --> 45:27.766
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

45:27.891 --> 45:30.144
-Maybe later.
-Uh, the-the gardens?

45:30.352 --> 45:33.480
-Or-or the-the-the library, perhaps?
-You have a library?

45:33.605 --> 45:35.691
Yes! Ye...oh, indeed.

45:35.774 --> 45:37.609
-With books.
-Scads of books.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.820
-Mountains of books.
-Forests of books.

45:39.903 --> 45:41.071
-Cascades.
-Cloudbursts.

45:41.196 --> 45:42.364
-Swamps of books.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.700
More books than you'll ever
be able to read in a lifetime.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.785
Books on every subject
ever studied,

45:47.077 --> 45:49.079
by every author
whoever set pen to paper.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.439
-Oh.

47:02.277 --> 47:05.364
-Why did you come here?
-I...I'm sorry.

47:05.447 --> 47:09.284
-I warned you never to come here.
-I didn't mean any harm.

47:09.368 --> 47:11.995
Do you realize
what you could have done?

47:12.079 --> 47:14.331
-Please, stop.

47:14.456 --> 47:16.667
-Get out!
-No!

47:18.836 --> 47:20.546
Get out!

47:49.324 --> 47:51.493
Okay. Okay.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.036
Okay.

48:05.757 --> 48:07.593
Okay.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.010
You saved me.

49:19.831 --> 49:21.833
Here, now. Oh, don't do that.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.424
-Just hold still.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.510
-That hurts!
-If you'd hold still,

49:31.635 --> 49:32.719
it wouldn't hurt as much.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.888
Well, if you hadn't have run away,
this wouldn't have happened.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.766
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.395
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.563
Well, you should learn
to control your temper.

49:47.317 --> 49:48.694
Now hold still.

49:49.152 --> 49:52.447
-This might sting a little.
-Hmm?

49:53.532 --> 49:57.619
By the way,
thank you for saving my life.

50:02.332 --> 50:03.583
You're welcome.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.880
GASTON:<i> It's like this.</i>

50:09.089 --> 50:11.717
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.886
But she needs
a little persuasion.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.889
So you want me to throw
her father into the asylum

50:17.973 --> 50:20.225
<i>unless she agrees</i>
<i>to marry you?</i>

50:21.101 --> 50:23.478
<i>Oh, that is despicable.</i>

50:23.729 --> 50:26.023
<i>I love it.</i>

50:28.692 --> 50:31.695
If no one will help me,
then I'll go back alone.

50:31.778 --> 50:34.823
Yeah. Is that everything?
I don't care what it takes.

50:34.906 --> 50:36.283
I'll find that castle,

50:36.366 --> 50:39.119
and somehow,
I'll get her out of there.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.309
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

51:04.352 --> 51:05.937
I want to do something for her.

51:07.147 --> 51:08.065
But what?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.983
Well, there's the usual things...

51:10.067 --> 51:13.612
flowers, chocolates, promises
you don't intend to keep.

51:13.695 --> 51:17.699
Ah, no, no.
It has to be something very special.

51:18.033 --> 51:20.118
Something that sparks
her interest.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.244
Wait a minute!

51:23.747 --> 51:24.915
Belle...

51:25.707 --> 51:27.667
there's something
I want to show you.

51:29.878 --> 51:32.089
But first,
you have to close your eyes.

51:34.716 --> 51:35.801
It's a surprise.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.606
-Can I open them?
-No, no. Not yet.

51:50.982 --> 51:51.983
Wait here.

51:57.572 --> 51:58.865
Now can I open them?

51:59.282 --> 52:01.785
All right. Now.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.920
I can't believe it.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.006
I've never seen so many books
in all my life.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.426
-You... you like it?
-It's wonderful.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.678
Then it's yours.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.389
Oh, thank you so much.

52:22.597 --> 52:23.890
Would you look at that?

52:23.974 --> 52:25.892
I knew it would work.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.311
-What? What worked?

52:28.395 --> 52:30.438
It's very encouraging.

52:30.522 --> 52:33.150
-Isn't this exciting?
-I didn't see anything.

52:33.233 --> 52:36.278
Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.

52:36.444 --> 52:40.198
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.

53:38.381 --> 53:42.135
<i>There's something sweet and almost kind</i>

53:42.219 --> 53:45.972
<i>But he was mean and he was</i>
<i>Coarse and unrefined</i>

53:46.056 --> 53:49.226
<i>And now he's dear and so unsure</i>

53:49.976 --> 53:54.105
<i>I wonder why I didn't see it there before</i>

54:06.868 --> 54:10.330
<i>She glanced this way,</i>
<i>I thought I saw</i>

54:10.914 --> 54:14.542
<i>And when we touched</i>
<i>She didn't shudder at my paw</i>

54:14.668 --> 54:16.086
<i>No, it can't be</i>

54:16.419 --> 54:17.963
<i>I'll just ignore</i>

54:18.588 --> 54:22.342
<i>But then she's never looked</i>
<i>At me that way before</i>

54:24.970 --> 54:31.184
<i>New and a bit alarming</i>

54:31.268 --> 54:33.812
<i>Who'd have ever thought</i>

54:33.895 --> 54:39.609
<i>That this could be</i>

54:40.568 --> 54:46.116
<i>True that he's no Prince Charming</i>

54:46.783 --> 54:49.327
<i>But there's something in him</i>

54:49.494 --> 54:53.915
<i>That I simply didn't see</i>

54:54.708 --> 54:56.918
<i>-Well, who'd have thought</i>
<i>-Well, bless my soul</i>

54:57.002 --> 54:58.795
<i>-Well, who'd have known</i>
<i>-Well, who indeed</i>

54:58.920 --> 55:01.589
<i>And who'd have guessed</i>
<i>They'd come together on their own</i>

55:01.715 --> 55:03.925
<i>-It's so peculiar</i>
<i>-We'll wait and see</i>

55:04.467 --> 55:06.136
<i>A few days more</i>

55:06.261 --> 55:09.556
<i>There maybe something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>

55:11.850 --> 55:13.476
You know, perhaps
there's something there

55:13.601 --> 55:15.270
that wasn't there before.

55:17.939 --> 55:21.568
<i>There may be something there</i>
<i>That wasn't there before</i>

55:21.860 --> 55:23.278
What's there, Mama?

55:24.195 --> 55:25.488
Shh.

55:25.572 --> 55:27.699
I'll tell you
when you're older.

55:41.463 --> 55:45.759
They start with a handful of notes,
crescendo in a symphony

55:45.842 --> 55:48.345
of imagination and creativity.

55:49.471 --> 55:52.849
<i>The sweeping score and songs</i>
<i>of Alan Menken.</i>

55:52.932 --> 55:55.894
<i>The unforgettable lyrics</i>
<i>of Howard Ashman.</i>

55:57.228 --> 56:01.566
<i>Together, they helped lead</i>
<i>a Disney animated musical renaissance</i>

56:01.649 --> 56:05.320
<i>with </i>Beauty and the Beast,
The Little Mermaid, <i>and</i> Aladdin.

56:07.697 --> 56:12.118
<i>While Ashman tragically passed away</i>
<i>before </i>Beauty and the Beast <i>was released,</i>

56:12.744 --> 56:16.748
<i>Menken has kept the spirit</i>
<i>of their partnership alive</i>

56:16.831 --> 56:21.503
<i>through his music</i>
<i>for Disney classics and beyond.</i>

56:22.379 --> 56:24.422
<i>Acclaimed as it is beloved,</i>

56:24.547 --> 56:27.133
<i>Menken and Ashman's work</i>
<i>on</i> Beauty and the Beast

56:27.217 --> 56:30.345
<i>did far more than achieve</i>
<i>a Tony nomination,</i>

56:30.553 --> 56:33.056
<i>four Grammys, and two Oscars.</i>

56:33.139 --> 56:35.725
The Oscar goes to Alan Menken
and Howard Ashman

56:35.809 --> 56:38.228
for "Beauty and the Beast"
from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

56:40.480 --> 56:43.274
NARRATOR:<i> It struck a chord in all of us,</i>

56:43.525 --> 56:45.902
<i>inspiring fans of all ages,</i>

56:46.569 --> 56:50.407
<i>including some of the biggest names</i>
<i>in the recording industry.</i>

56:52.158 --> 56:55.245
And just wait until you hear

56:55.453 --> 56:58.164
the wonderful rendition
of "Beauty and the Beast"

56:58.706 --> 56:59.874
that Shania Twain

56:59.958 --> 57:03.044
and eight-time Oscar-winning
composer Alan Menken

57:03.670 --> 57:05.630
have in store.

57:22.564 --> 57:25.608
-Tonight is the night.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.278
I'm not sure I can do this.

57:28.445 --> 57:32.240
You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.

57:32.407 --> 57:34.033
Bold. Daring.

57:37.871 --> 57:40.999
There will be music,
romantic candlelight,

57:41.875 --> 57:43.168
provided by myself.

57:43.751 --> 57:46.713
And when the moment is right,
you confess your love.

57:47.922 --> 57:51.843
Yes. I con...I ...
I... no, I can't.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.344
You care for the girl, don't you?

57:53.511 --> 57:55.638
-More than anything.

57:55.763 --> 57:57.348
Well, then you must tell her.

57:59.559 --> 58:03.271
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh, you look so...so...

58:03.396 --> 58:04.689
Stupid.

58:05.440 --> 58:09.819
Not quite the word I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.618
Your lady awaits.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.937
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

58:46.231 --> 58:49.108
<i>True as it can be</i>

58:51.444 --> 58:53.863
<i>Barely even friends</i>

58:54.113 --> 58:56.449
<i>Then somebody bends</i>

58:56.658 --> 58:59.452
<i>Unexpectedly</i>

59:01.829 --> 59:05.708
<i>Just a little change</i>

59:06.834 --> 59:09.462
<i>Small to say the least</i>

59:09.546 --> 59:14.759
<i>Both a little scared</i>
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

59:14.842 --> 59:18.012
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

59:20.515 --> 59:23.768
<i>Ever just the same</i>

59:25.311 --> 59:29.190
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

59:30.650 --> 59:35.446
<i>Ever as before</i>
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

59:35.655 --> 59:39.200
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

59:39.993 --> 59:42.287
<i>Oh</i>

59:43.413 --> 59:46.666
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

59:48.084 --> 59:50.753
<i>Tune as old as song</i>

59:53.131 --> 59:55.717
<i>Bittersweet and strange</i>

59:55.800 --> 59:58.344
<i>Finding you can change</i>

59:58.428 --> 1:00:02.181
<i>Learning you were wrong</i>

1:00:03.516 --> 1:00:06.227
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1:00:08.271 --> 1:00:10.690
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1:00:10.898 --> 1:00:13.109
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1:00:13.318 --> 1:00:16.112
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1:00:16.195 --> 1:00:20.700
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:25.788
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1:00:25.955 --> 1:00:29.250
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1:00:31.502 --> 1:00:37.425
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:40.553
<i>Off to the cupboard</i>
<i>with you now, Chip.</i>

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.347
<i>-It's past your bedtime.</i>

1:00:42.430 --> 1:00:44.182
<i>Mm, mm</i>

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:45.933
<i>Good night, love.</i>

1:01:07.455 --> 1:01:08.456
Belle?

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:13.753
Are you happy here with me?

1:01:14.295 --> 1:01:15.505
Yes.

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.511
What is it?

1:01:23.304 --> 1:01:25.390
If only I could see my father again.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:28.518
Just for a moment.
I miss him so much.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:35.608
There is a way.

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:40.863
This mirror will show you anything.

1:01:41.447 --> 1:01:43.074
Anything you wish to see.

1:01:44.450 --> 1:01:47.161
I'd like to see my father, please.

1:01:54.168 --> 1:01:56.504
Papa! Oh, no.

1:01:57.422 --> 1:01:58.506
He's sick.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:01.467
He may be dying,
and he's all alone.

1:02:08.015 --> 1:02:10.727
Then you... you must go to him.

1:02:11.352 --> 1:02:13.855
-What did you say?
-I release you.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:15.982
You're no longer my prisoner.

1:02:16.232 --> 1:02:18.776
You mean... I'm free?

1:02:19.444 --> 1:02:20.653
Yes.

1:02:21.237 --> 1:02:22.822
Oh, thank you.

1:02:23.781 --> 1:02:26.117
Hold on, Papa, I'm on my way.

1:02:28.870 --> 1:02:30.163
Take it with you

1:02:30.621 --> 1:02:34.751
so you'll always have a way
to look back and remember me.

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:41.507
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

1:02:50.433 --> 1:02:52.018
Well, Your Highness,

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:55.229
I must say everything is going
just swimmingly.

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:58.107
I knew you had it in you.

1:02:58.357 --> 1:03:00.443
-I let her go.

1:03:00.526 --> 1:03:01.611
Yes, yes.

1:03:01.944 --> 1:03:04.614
Splen...you what?

1:03:05.573 --> 1:03:08.493
-How could you do that?
-I had to.

1:03:08.951 --> 1:03:11.829
Yes, but-but-but... but why?

1:03:11.996 --> 1:03:15.041
Because I love her.

1:03:41.192 --> 1:03:44.904
<i>I was the one who had it all</i>

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:49.700
<i>I was the master of my fate</i>

1:03:50.493 --> 1:03:55.289
<i>I never needed anybody in my life</i>

1:03:55.581 --> 1:03:59.335
<i>I learned the truth too late</i>

1:04:00.294 --> 1:04:03.589
<i>I'll never shake away the pain</i>

1:04:04.966 --> 1:04:08.427
<i>I close my eyes but she's still there</i>

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:14.267
<i>I let her steal into my melancholy heart</i>

1:04:14.725 --> 1:04:19.730
<i>It's more than I can bear</i>

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:25.403
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:30.032
<i>Even as she runs away</i>

1:04:30.157 --> 1:04:32.702
<i>She will still torment me</i>

1:04:33.035 --> 1:04:39.625
<i>Calm me, hurt me</i>
<i>Move me, come what may</i>

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:44.005
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

1:04:44.547 --> 1:04:48.885
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

1:04:50.052 --> 1:04:52.638
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

1:04:54.849 --> 1:04:58.603
<i>And be with me for evermore</i>

1:05:31.844 --> 1:05:35.389
<i>I rage against the trials of love</i>

1:05:36.265 --> 1:05:40.186
<i>I curse the fading of the light</i>

1:05:40.728 --> 1:05:44.649
<i>Though she's already flown</i>
<i>So far beyond my reach</i>

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:50.738
<i>She's never out of sight</i>

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:55.826
<i>Now I know she'll never leave me</i>

1:05:56.035 --> 1:06:00.122
<i>Even as she fades from view</i>

1:06:00.623 --> 1:06:03.584
<i>She will still inspire me</i>

1:06:03.668 --> 1:06:09.799
<i>Be a part of everything I do</i>

1:06:10.174 --> 1:06:14.512
<i>Wasting in my lonely tower</i>

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:19.225
<i>Waiting by an open door</i>

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:22.812
<i>I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in</i>

1:06:24.230 --> 1:06:28.192
<i>And as the long, long nights begin</i>

1:06:28.567 --> 1:06:32.279
<i>I'll think of all that might have been</i>

1:06:32.405 --> 1:06:34.323
<i>Waiting here</i>

1:06:34.532 --> 1:06:41.455
<i>For evermore</i>

1:07:05.813 --> 1:07:08.149
What defines the legacy of a story?

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:13.612
Its enduring impact both on
and off the screen for evermore.

1:07:14.613 --> 1:07:17.408
<i>Perhaps it's seeing</i>
<i>that story reinvented</i>

1:07:17.533 --> 1:07:21.120
<i>just as </i>Beauty and the Beast
<i>was in its ground-breaking,</i>

1:07:21.287 --> 1:07:23.956
<i>highly-acclaimed Broadway adaptation.</i>

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:27.918
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>Disney Theatrical Productions</i>

1:07:28.002 --> 1:07:30.463
<i>under the direction</i>
<i>of its president and producer,</i>

1:07:30.546 --> 1:07:34.258
<i>Thomas Schumacher,</i>
<i>has forged a new chapter</i>

1:07:34.508 --> 1:07:37.928
<i>in the legacy</i>
<i>of this classic title,</i>

1:07:38.012 --> 1:07:41.098
<i>one that gave audiences</i>
<i>around the world</i>

1:07:41.223 --> 1:07:44.894
<i>a chance to fall in love</i>
<i>with these iconic characters</i>

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:49.565
<i>all over again,</i>
<i>from India to Australia</i>

1:07:50.399 --> 1:07:52.485
<i>to the warm Footlights</i>
<i>in the West End</i>

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:54.445
<i>and throughout the UK.</i>

1:07:56.822 --> 1:08:00.534
<i>Or perhaps the legacy</i>
<i>of this timeless classic</i>

1:08:00.618 --> 1:08:03.579
<i>is in witnessing the magical</i>
<i>spark of inspiration</i>

1:08:03.662 --> 1:08:06.832
<i>it ignites in artists,</i>
<i>in children</i>

1:08:06.999 --> 1:08:09.460
<i>who wish they could be</i>
<i>part of its world,</i>

1:08:09.668 --> 1:08:13.464
<i>and in grown-ups</i>
<i>who still dream of the same.</i>

1:08:15.341 --> 1:08:18.010
As for where
that legacy will go from here,

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:20.805
only time will tell.

1:08:21.263 --> 1:08:24.475
But if you would care to make
a prediction,

1:08:25.017 --> 1:08:27.978
please, be our guest.

1:08:31.524 --> 1:08:32.441
Hi!

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:48.582
It's all right, Papa.
I'm home.

1:08:50.167 --> 1:08:52.920
I thought I'd never see you again.

1:08:53.712 --> 1:08:55.214
I missed you so much.

1:08:55.464 --> 1:08:57.883
But the Beast... how did you escape?

1:08:58.008 --> 1:09:00.761
I didn't escape, Papa.
He...he let me go.

1:09:01.178 --> 1:09:04.348
-That horrible Beast?
-But he's different now, Papa.

1:09:04.765 --> 1:09:07.101
He's changed somehow.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:15.526
-Hi!
-Oh, a stowaway.

1:09:15.609 --> 1:09:18.654
Why, hello there, little fella.

1:09:18.988 --> 1:09:21.073
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1:09:21.323 --> 1:09:25.703
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us anymore?

1:09:26.203 --> 1:09:28.289
Oh, Chip, of course I do.

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:29.623
-It's just that...

1:09:32.668 --> 1:09:36.172
-May I help you?
<i>-I've come to collect your father.</i>

1:09:36.255 --> 1:09:39.008
<i>-My father?</i>
<i>-Don't worry, mademoiselle.</i>

1:09:39.592 --> 1:09:42.511
-We'll take good care of him.

1:09:42.595 --> 1:09:46.223
-My father's not crazy.
-He was raving like a lunatic.

1:09:46.390 --> 1:09:49.768
-We all heard him, didn't we?

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:51.395
-No!

1:09:51.478 --> 1:09:53.105
-I won't let you.
-Belle?

1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:56.150
Maurice.
Tell us again, old man.

1:09:56.442 --> 1:10:00.070
Just how big was the Beast?

1:10:00.154 --> 1:10:03.073
He was...I mean, he was...
he was enormous!

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:07.161
I'd say at least 8...
no, more like 10 feet.

1:10:09.371 --> 1:10:11.832
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1:10:13.167 --> 1:10:14.668
It's true, I tell you!

1:10:15.502 --> 1:10:17.087
-Get him out of here.

1:10:17.171 --> 1:10:18.380
Let go of me!

1:10:18.756 --> 1:10:20.799
No! You can't do this.

1:10:22.301 --> 1:10:25.429
Poor Belle.
It's a shame about your father.

1:10:25.512 --> 1:10:27.306
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1:10:27.473 --> 1:10:32.853
Mm, I might be able to clear up
this little misunderstanding, if...

1:10:33.103 --> 1:10:35.814
-If what?
-If you marry me.

1:10:36.190 --> 1:10:38.275
-What?
-One little word, Belle.

1:10:38.359 --> 1:10:39.818
That's all it takes.

1:10:39.902 --> 1:10:41.445
-Never.
-Have it your way.

1:10:41.612 --> 1:10:43.697
Belle? Hey...

1:10:44.031 --> 1:10:45.157
Let go of me.

1:10:45.532 --> 1:10:48.035
My father's not crazy,
and I can prove it.

1:10:48.327 --> 1:10:49.703
Show me the Beast!

1:10:58.295 --> 1:11:00.130
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1:11:00.798 --> 1:11:01.924
He'll come after them
in the night.

1:11:02.007 --> 1:11:03.676
-No!
-Gaston is right!

1:11:04.093 --> 1:11:07.972
Look at its sharp, cruel fangs.
It's threat to us all!

1:11:08.347 --> 1:11:11.016
We're not safe until its head
is mounted on my wall.

1:11:11.433 --> 1:11:14.478
-I say we kill the Beast!
-Yeah!

1:11:14.561 --> 1:11:16.480
No! I won't let you do this.

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:18.399
The monster must have her
under his spell.

1:11:18.565 --> 1:11:20.567
He'll curse us all
if we don't stop him.

1:11:21.068 --> 1:11:23.112
-Yeah!
-If you're not with us...

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:25.864
-you're against us!

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:27.074
Bring the old man.

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:29.285
Get your hands off me!

1:11:29.618 --> 1:11:32.496
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1:11:32.621 --> 1:11:33.914
-Let us out!

1:11:35.374 --> 1:11:38.460
We'll rid the village of this Beast.
Who's with me?

1:11:38.544 --> 1:11:40.546
Yeah!

1:11:40.629 --> 1:11:42.172
<i>Through the mist</i>
<i>Through the woods</i>

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:43.799
<i>Through the darkness and the shadows</i>

1:11:43.882 --> 1:11:46.844
<i>It's a nightmare</i>
<i>But it's one exciting ride</i>

1:11:46.927 --> 1:11:50.180
<i>Say a prayer then we're there</i>
<i>At the drawbridge of a castle</i>

1:11:50.264 --> 1:11:53.058
<i>And there's something</i>
<i>Truly terrible inside</i>

1:11:53.434 --> 1:11:56.770
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>He's got fangs, razor sharp ones</i>

1:11:56.854 --> 1:11:59.690
<i>Massive paws</i>
<i>Killer claws for the feast</i>

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:03.068
<i>Hear him roar, see him foam</i>
<i>But we're not coming home</i>

1:12:03.152 --> 1:12:04.862
<i>Till he's dead</i>

1:12:05.112 --> 1:12:06.613
<i>-Good and dead</i>
-Yeah!

1:12:06.780 --> 1:12:08.324
<i>-Kill the beast</i>
<i>-Mount your horse</i>

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:10.117
<i>Screw your courage</i>
<i>To the sticking place</i>

1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:13.078
<i>We're counting on Gaston</i>
<i>To lead the way</i>

1:12:13.245 --> 1:12:16.332
<i>Through the mist, through the wood</i>
<i>Where within a haunted castle</i>

1:12:16.415 --> 1:12:19.460
<i>Something's lurking</i>
<i>That you don't see every day</i>

1:12:19.752 --> 1:12:22.671
<i>It's a beast</i>
<i>One as tall as a mountain</i>

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:26.216
<i>We won't rest till he's good and deceased</i>

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:29.595
<i>Sally forth, tally ho</i>
<i>Grab your sword, grab your bow</i>

1:12:29.678 --> 1:12:31.096
<i>Praise the Lord and here we go</i>

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:32.890
We'll lay siege to the castle.

1:12:33.098 --> 1:12:35.184
<i>We don't like</i>
<i>What we don't understand</i>

1:12:35.267 --> 1:12:36.477
<i>In fact it scares us</i>

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.313
<i>And this monster is mysterious at least</i>

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:42.816
<i>Bring your guns, bring your knives</i>
<i>Save your children and your wives</i>

1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:45.694
<i>We'll save our village and our lives</i>

1:12:45.903 --> 1:12:47.363
<i>We'll kill the beast</i>

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:49.740
Take whatever booty
you can find.

1:12:49.823 --> 1:12:52.868
But remember,
the Beast is mine!

1:12:52.951 --> 1:12:55.954
<i>Hearts ablaze, banners high</i>
<i>We go marching into battle</i>

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:59.041
<i>Unafraid although</i>
<i>The danger just increased</i>

1:12:59.249 --> 1:13:02.211
<i>Raise your flag, sing the song</i>
<i>Here we come, we're 50 strong</i>

1:13:02.294 --> 1:13:06.548
<i>And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong</i>
<i>Let's kill the beast</i>

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.780
-Now!

1:13:47.005 --> 1:13:49.133
Yes!

1:13:53.762 --> 1:13:55.013
Here we go!

1:13:58.725 --> 1:14:01.103
-What the devil?

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:02.438
Belle, look out!

1:14:09.194 --> 1:14:11.488
You guys gotta try
this thing.

1:14:13.699 --> 1:14:16.743
-Move, move, move, move.

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:23.167
And stay out.

1:14:25.836 --> 1:14:27.379
Ugh.

1:14:53.447 --> 1:14:54.656
Get up.

1:14:56.909 --> 1:14:58.035
Get up!

1:14:58.577 --> 1:15:01.872
What's the matter, Beast?

1:15:01.955 --> 1:15:04.958
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1:15:12.382 --> 1:15:13.800
BELLE:<i> No!</i>

1:15:16.553 --> 1:15:19.765
-Belle...
-No, Gaston, don't!

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:26.688
Let's go, Philippe.

1:15:41.954 --> 1:15:44.122
Come on out and fight.

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:49.044
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1:15:49.127 --> 1:15:51.505
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1:15:51.672 --> 1:15:53.757
when she had someone like me?

1:16:05.936 --> 1:16:07.771
It's over, Beast.

1:16:08.021 --> 1:16:09.898
Belle is mine!

1:16:14.027 --> 1:16:16.989
Let me go. Let me go!

1:16:17.072 --> 1:16:18.407
Please, don't hurt me.

1:16:18.490 --> 1:16:20.284
I'll do anything. Anything!

1:16:34.631 --> 1:16:37.134
-Get out.

1:16:37.384 --> 1:16:38.427
Beast!

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:40.554
Belle?

1:16:49.563 --> 1:16:50.731
Belle.

1:16:56.778 --> 1:16:58.280
You came back.

1:17:22.512 --> 1:17:23.597
Oh.

1:17:37.402 --> 1:17:38.362
You...

1:17:40.197 --> 1:17:43.492
-you came back.
-Of course I came back.

1:17:43.992 --> 1:17:45.202
I couldn't let them...

1:17:45.952 --> 1:17:47.746
Oh, this is all my fault.

1:17:48.205 --> 1:17:50.832
-If only I'd gotten here sooner.
-Maybe...

1:17:52.334 --> 1:17:54.586
it's better... it's better this way.

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:56.129
Don't talk like that.

1:17:57.172 --> 1:17:59.549
-You'll be all right.

1:17:59.633 --> 1:18:02.969
We're together now.
Everything's going to be fine. You'll see.

1:18:03.845 --> 1:18:05.430
At...

1:18:05.681 --> 1:18:06.807
at least...

1:18:07.849 --> 1:18:09.309
I got to see you

1:18:10.644 --> 1:18:12.104
one last time.

1:18:23.073 --> 1:18:23.949
No.

1:18:24.157 --> 1:18:25.242
No!

1:18:26.159 --> 1:18:28.036
Please, please.

1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:30.080
Please, don't leave me.

1:18:33.959 --> 1:18:35.252
I love you.

1:20:54.432 --> 1:20:56.977
Belle. It's me!

1:21:12.868 --> 1:21:14.286
It is you!

1:21:47.402 --> 1:21:50.614
Lumière. Cogsworth!

1:21:51.239 --> 1:21:53.575
Oh! Mrs. Potts!

1:21:53.909 --> 1:21:55.869
-Look at us!

1:21:55.994 --> 1:21:57.579
Mama, mama!

1:22:01.625 --> 1:22:03.793
-Oh, my goodness.

1:22:04.044 --> 1:22:05.754
-It is a miracle!

1:22:48.380 --> 1:22:52.717
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:59.265
<i>True as it can be</i>

1:23:01.267 --> 1:23:03.853
<i>Barely even friends</i>

1:23:04.187 --> 1:23:11.152
<i>Then somebody bends unexpectedly</i>

1:23:13.279 --> 1:23:16.324
<i>Just a little change</i>

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:19.077
<i>Just a little change</i>

1:23:19.285 --> 1:23:22.372
<i>Small to say the least</i>

1:23:22.664 --> 1:23:25.542
<i>Both a little scared</i>

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:28.378
<i>Neither one prepared</i>

1:23:28.628 --> 1:23:34.801
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1:23:35.051 --> 1:23:39.889
<i>Ever just the same</i>

1:23:41.391 --> 1:23:46.896
<i>Ever a surprise</i>

1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:50.608
<i>Ever as before</i>

1:23:50.692 --> 1:23:53.528
<i>Ever just as sure</i>

1:23:53.778 --> 1:23:59.034
<i>As the sun will rise</i>

1:24:09.252 --> 1:24:12.422
<i>Oh!</i>

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.533
<i>Certain as the sun</i>

1:24:40.617 --> 1:24:43.703
H.E.R.: <i>Certain as the sun</i>

1:24:43.787 --> 1:24:46.998
<i>Rising in the east</i>

1:24:47.082 --> 1:24:50.251
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1:24:50.335 --> 1:24:53.379
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1:24:53.588 --> 1:24:59.969
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>

1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:03.056
<i>Tale as old as time</i>

1:25:03.181 --> 1:25:06.309
<i>Song as old as rhyme</i>

1:25:07.685 --> 1:25:10.563
<i>Beauty and</i>

1:25:11.231 --> 1:25:17.570
<i>The Beast</i>

1:26:38.735 --> 1:26:41.196
Follow me!

1:26:42.155 --> 1:26:43.072
Lunch?

1:26:45.325 --> 1:26:46.826
-Okay, one, two, three...
-Wolves.

1:26:49.370 --> 1:26:51.289
Everybody sing along.

1:27:01.049 --> 1:27:02.008
Uh...

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:07.972
Say hello to Mark Henn,
who actually animated Belle.

1:27:11.142 --> 1:27:13.394
What kind of shenanigans
will happen next?

1:27:16.606 --> 1:27:18.233
The amazing world of Disney.

1:27:23.821 --> 1:27:24.948
Now bounce, now bounce.

1:27:29.118 --> 1:27:31.204
I had the best time,
and I'm sad it's over.
