Andrew: So, the bear's looking
at us,

00:02.569 --> 00:04.103
And we're looking at the bear
like, "what do we do?"

00:04.238 --> 00:06.038
Yeah, and that's when we
decided to just let the bear

00:06.040 --> 00:07.305
Keep the cooler.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.107
Other than that,
the rv trip was great.

It was dead, but still.

Oh, sorry,

Hold on.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.360
Okay.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.262
So, what are the kids
getting these days?

00:30.331 --> 00:31.830
Spaceship popsicles.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.332
I'll have the rum raisin.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.201
Okay, old man.

And, um, what flavours of
soft serve do you have?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.240
Vanilla, chocolate,
strawberry, or coconut,

00:41.242 --> 00:42.407
Or we could do a swirl.

00:42.410 --> 00:47.078
Okay, I will do
a strawberry coconut swirl.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.046
Actually, never mind.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.948
Um, I'll do a swirl, for sure,

00:50.084 --> 00:51.817

Just pick something.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.353
Excuse me?

00:55.423 --> 00:58.423
There's no butter
chicken ice cream, okay?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.192
So, just, you know,
pick a normal flavour
