00:02.370 --> 00:04.305
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...
You know what to do, man.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.274
<i>It's not like it's
a full-time hustle, all right?</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:07.941
<i>Every now and again I get paid
to deliver these packages.</i>

00:08.042 --> 00:09.343
When you take shortcuts,

00:09.443 --> 00:10.911
eventually you get cut short.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.381
Just don't tell Manny,
all right?
I won't.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.383
But maybe you should.

00:15.483 --> 00:19.053
No business is conducted
near my gym.

00:19.153 --> 00:19.953
Ever.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.659
You want some more
of the old man combo?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.098
<i>I did get into it
with a guy at the gym.</i>

00:31.432 --> 00:32.366
Give me a name.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.402
Lo-Lo.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.511
Why is this bus stopping here?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.979
Are they lost?
I don't know.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.527
<i>This is a shameful stunt.</i>

00:59.627 --> 01:02.130
These people have fled
unthinkable situations,

01:02.230 --> 01:05.099
only to be greeted in the U.S.
by a calculating prankster

01:05.199 --> 01:07.034
posing as a caring politician.

01:07.135 --> 01:10.271
They're human beings,
not political pawns.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.772
And they need our help.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.242
That's why I've invited
Jaime and Marisol Perez

01:14.342 --> 01:15.543
into my home,

01:15.643 --> 01:16.977
to give them
the support they need

01:17.077 --> 01:18.546
until they can get
on their feet.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.248
I'm trying to lead by example

01:20.348 --> 01:22.250
and inspire others
to do the same.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.453
Hello?

01:25.553 --> 01:28.122
Jaime? Marisol?

01:37.798 --> 01:38.899
Jaime?

01:38.999 --> 01:40.501
Marisol?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.772
Hello?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.377
Who's in there?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.450
Get away from me. Let go.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.519
Stop!

02:08.562 --> 02:09.563
Morning.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.865
Morning, Auntie. Morning.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.833
You ate already?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.768
Early bird catches the worm.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.304
And the eggs, apparently.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.206
I'll make you some fresh.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.707
Oh, that's pretty good.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.476
A student's?
It is.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.113
Everything all right with
that new teaching gig?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.515
Oh, it's wonderful.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.183
Students are great.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.452
Very talented. Mm.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.121
I'm sensing
a "but" coming...

02:34.222 --> 02:36.790
I'm concerned
about this one student.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.226
Why?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.593
I think there's trouble at home.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.430
Look at this.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.999
He always paints a happy family,

02:46.099 --> 02:48.369
but there's always
this figure in shadow,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.538
separate from everyone else.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.639
You talked to him about it?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.974
I don't even know how to begin.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.743
He just-- he's so quiet.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.778
He hardly says a word in class.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.648
Yeah, it sounds like
he may need some help.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.116
Lucky for him,
he has you as his teacher.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.621
Ah.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.122
I got a client meeting.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.358
But Dee is right.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.592
You should talk to him.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.261
If anyone can get through
to this child,

03:13.361 --> 03:15.229
Aunt Vi, it's you.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.969
Let's start at the beginning.
Tell me what happened.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.739
My husband Jaime...

03:27.140 --> 03:29.142
...the police said that
he tried to kill

03:29.243 --> 03:30.411
Elena Acevedo.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.112
The congresswoman?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.848
I've been following that story.
She's in critical condition.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.350
But he didn't do it.
The news said

03:36.450 --> 03:38.419
he was covered in blood
when the cops found him

03:38.519 --> 03:39.620
fleeing the scene.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.788
How do you explain that?

03:40.888 --> 03:41.989
He heard a gunshot.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.492
He went downstairs
and found Elena.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.695
He called 911,
but he got scared and ran.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.298
He knew nobody here
would believe him.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.732
And where were you at the time?

03:51.832 --> 03:54.034
I was helping out
at the shelter.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.803
This is surreal.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.439
Back home in Venezuela,
we were respected.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.173
I was a teacher,

04:00.274 --> 04:02.343
Jaime had his MBA.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.711
Since we've been here,

04:03.811 --> 04:05.713
people treat us
like we're dirt.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.883
Sorry about that.
We weren't even supposed
to be in New York.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.952
They told us we were
going to Boston,

04:12.052 --> 04:14.288
but like everything else,
that was a lie.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.789
Wait, you came up on those buses

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
that were sent up
from the border?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.194
Now I wish
we'd never come, but...

04:21.295 --> 04:22.763
we didn't have much of a choice.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.732
I love my country,

04:24.832 --> 04:26.467
but it is broken--

04:26.567 --> 04:29.470
crime, poverty, food shortages.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.572
We kept hoping
things would get better,

04:31.672 --> 04:32.873
but it only got worse.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.775
We spent every penny
that we had

04:34.875 --> 04:36.143
just to get to the border.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.579
We traveled on foot
for weeks.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.748
Starving.
Many didn't make it.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.383
Sounds like hell.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.951
It was.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.054
I never would have survived
if it wasn't for Jaime.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.625
My husband is a good man.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.364
We have nowhere else to go.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.999
Please...

04:59.099 --> 05:00.834
will you help us?

05:04.872 --> 05:07.875
They were so hopeful
when they boarded that bus.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.543
Now they're living
a nightmare.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.111
The congresswoman was

05:11.211 --> 05:12.880
one of the few people
who was really trying to help.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.082
Any word on how she's doing?
Last I read,

05:15.182 --> 05:16.283
she was in surgery.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.518
Reports are saying
it could go either way.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.086
Why would someone
want to kill her?

05:19.186 --> 05:21.522
She was really outspoken--
made her pretty divisive.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.756
She's made a lot of enemies.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.991
And there's no evidence

05:24.091 --> 05:25.258
saying that Jaime is
one of them.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.494
But the press
and the public

05:26.594 --> 05:27.595
seem ready to convict him

05:27.695 --> 05:29.096
even before he's tried.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.464
I'll talk to Dante,

05:30.564 --> 05:33.066
find out where NYPD is at
with their investigation.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.669
Maybe he can arrange for me
to talk to Jaime.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.237
Hear his side of things.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.811
Evidence against Jaime's only
circumstantial so far.

05:43.911 --> 05:44.945
What do you have?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.279
Jaime was living
in the house,

05:46.380 --> 05:47.848
and there were no signs
of a break-in.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.249
What about the murder weapon?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.283
Weapon's MIA.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.185
But Elena's .38 is also missing.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.422
And based on the
initial ballistics,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.089
Elena was shot with a .38, so...

05:56.189 --> 05:58.225
So you think she was shot
with her own gun?

05:58.325 --> 05:59.560
I'm about to speak
to her husband,

05:59.660 --> 06:00.661
see what he can tell us.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.129
Husband have an alibi?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.364
He was out of town
when the shooting happened.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.601
No unusual bank activity,
phone records are clean.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.136
I'll let you know
if I find out anything.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.572
WOMAN
Pharmacy, pick up 1721.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.573
Pharmacy, pick up...

06:12.673 --> 06:13.807
Mr. Acevedo?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.444
I'm Detective Dante.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.845
I know this is
a difficult time,

06:17.945 --> 06:19.980
but I have
a few questions for you.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.015
I thought you had
Jaime in custody.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.017
We just want to make sure
we got the right guy.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.320
Was there any animosity
between your wife and Jaime?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.922
No.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.191
I mean, he seemed nice,
but we didn't really know him.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.127
Now I feel like an idiot
for leaving.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.197
Thank God our son was with
my parents for the weekend.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.968
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell him if...

06:43.303 --> 06:45.138
I understand you were
in Chicago on business

06:45.238 --> 06:46.339
when it happened.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.175
I rushed back
as soon as I heard.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.010
When you got home,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.446
was there anything missing
or out of place?

06:53.714 --> 06:55.282
I haven't been home yet.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.850
I don't think
I can go back there

06:56.950 --> 06:59.186
without Elena with me.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.456
Mr. Acevedo.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.458
That's Elena's doctor.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.771
I've been sent to help you,
but I need to know something.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.007
Did you shoot
Congresswoman Acevedo?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.441
No!

07:23.443 --> 07:24.678
Why would I hurt her?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.379
She's the only person
giving us hope.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.883
Look, I want to believe you,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.318
but you got to help me out.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.454
Did you see or hear
anything suspicious that night?

07:34.555 --> 07:37.491
Any indication that there was
someone else in the house?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.693
No. I...

07:39.793 --> 07:42.229
I was exhausted.
I-I fell asleep early.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.065
All I remember is a gunshot
woke me up and then...

07:46.567 --> 07:49.737
I can't stop thinking about her
lying in all that blood.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.839
I tried to help her.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.675
I would never hurt
Congresswoman Acevedo.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.809
I swear.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.050
Dante, what's up?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.618
Bad news.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.820
Congresswoman Acevedo just died
on the operating table.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
I'm so sorry.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.123
Damn.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.559
You know what this means.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.894
Charges against Jaime Perez
are being upped...

08:15.062 --> 08:16.429
...to murder.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.217
If we're gonna exonerate Jaime,

08:37.317 --> 08:38.986
the best bet is to find
the real killer.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.254
I checked all the cameras in
the vicinity of Elena's house.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.723
Coverage was spotty.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.224
A Ring cam caught him
running down the block.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.492
I know it doesn't look good,

08:45.593 --> 08:46.860
but I've seen
plenty of killers.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.929
And he doesn't
strike me as one.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.632
So, if it wasn't him,
who would want to hurt Elena?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.033
I mean,
that's a long list.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.068
Her office says that
she was getting threats daily.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.738
Didn't I read a headline
recently about a dispute

08:57.838 --> 08:59.306
between her
and a former roommate?

08:59.406 --> 09:00.574
Oh, yeah,
something about the roommate

09:00.674 --> 09:02.042
threatening to sell pics
to a tabloid.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.410
I'll look into it.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.212
And let's talk to someone
in Elena's office.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.681
Her staff must keep a list
of the worst offenders.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.150
This traffic is a mess.
I'm at least an hour away.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.986
Well, her office is nearby.
I'll head over.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.388
I'll see what I can find.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.994
GREY
Representative Acevedo

09:21.094 --> 09:22.663
was an esteemed colleague,

09:22.763 --> 09:24.064
a valued member of the House,

09:24.164 --> 09:25.398
and she will be missed.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.000
Can I help you?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.669
Hi, I'm Annalynne.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.203
I'm an investigator
looking into the murder

09:30.303 --> 09:31.371
of the congresswoman.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.539
Are you NYPD?

09:32.640 --> 09:33.941
I work alongside them.

09:34.041 --> 09:38.145
I'm Lacey Young,
Elena's chief of staff.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.446
I'm sorry.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.014
We're all a bit
distracted today.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.282
And now this.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.450
...not set a precedent

09:43.550 --> 09:44.852
as long as I'm in Congress.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.987
Suddenly Elena's an
"esteemed colleague."

09:47.087 --> 09:49.389
I won't take up
too much of your time.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.591
Does your office keep
records of threats

09:51.692 --> 09:53.727
against the congresswoman?
We've got a whole list.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.962
There were
so many of them.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.730
People can be
really nasty, too.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.999
Yesterday I saw a lawn sign
shaped like a snake

09:59.099 --> 10:03.070
that said "Acevedo is poisonous,
cut off her head."

10:03.170 --> 10:05.105
Who would make that?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.940
Used to be you could
disagree with someone

10:07.040 --> 10:08.709
about politics
and then go get a drink.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.678
Now it's either
"You agree with me

10:10.778 --> 10:12.445
or you're my enemy."

10:12.545 --> 10:14.481
You mentioned a list.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.116
Any chance
I could get a copy?
Sure.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.251
Let me print it out
for you.
Thank you.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.053
And is there anyone else
you can think of

10:20.153 --> 10:21.121
not on the list?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.322
Anyone Elena had
an issue with?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.692
No, no one
comes to mind.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.926
But you know who
you should ask?

10:26.026 --> 10:26.927
Carmen Santos.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.729
Who's Carmen Santos?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.130
Community activist.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.166
She was helping Elena
draft her migrant aid bill.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.102
It was Elena's
top priority, so...

10:35.202 --> 10:36.837
Carmen saw more of her
lately than I did.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.305
I've been chained to this desk.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.273
I hadn't seen her at all
the past few days.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.608
But, turns out,

10:41.709 --> 10:45.078
all that work on the bill
was a waste of time.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.446
What do you mean?

10:46.546 --> 10:48.315
Congressman Jennings called
not ten minutes ago,

10:48.415 --> 10:50.483
said he had
a change of heart.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.619
He's voting for the
anti-migrant bill instead.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.621
Why the sudden shift?
Let's just say

10:54.722 --> 10:56.523
her death at the hands of
an immigrant isn't really

10:56.623 --> 10:58.225
helping things.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.227
If Elena were alive...

11:00.327 --> 11:04.064
she would have fixed this.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.199
Thank you for your help.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.068
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.808
Hey, Rob, I got the list.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.309
Who's on it?
Who isn't on it?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.746
I'm looking at everyone
from disgruntled voters

11:18.846 --> 11:22.582
to fringe podcasters
to K Street lobbyists.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.753
The good news is, there's
someone we should talk to.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.055
She might be able
to narrow this down.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.658
Just remember--
concentrate on your own process.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.260
And above all,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.763
just don't compare yourself
to the person next to you.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.530
Focus on your own work.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.032
Good class.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.467
See y'all next week.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.579
This piece is really
coming along, Robby.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.447
I noticed you like
to paint a tagger

11:54.547 --> 11:55.715
into all of your work.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.550
That is such
an interesting choice.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.186
Can you tell me
about it?

11:59.286 --> 12:01.154
Just something I like to do.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.591
You also like
to paint him in shadow.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.559
Why is that?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.663
I don't know.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.532
I'm kind of in a hurry.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.502
See you next week, Ms. Marsette.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.006
I could give you a ride,
if you like.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.042
Faster than walking
if you're in a hurry,

12:22.142 --> 12:24.778
but... it's up to you.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.182
Yeah.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.851
Thanks.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.203
Carmen Santos?

12:50.303 --> 12:53.540
Mm-hmm. Yeah, there.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.277
Excuse me, Carmen Santos?
Yes?

12:57.377 --> 13:00.047
I'm looking into the murder
of Elena Acevedo.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.352
Are you police?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.020
Family friend.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.756
Can I ask you
a few questions?
Of course.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.391
I still can't believe
she's gone.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.227
She was a hero
to our people.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.629
Your people?
Migrants.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.766
I came here three years ago
to apply for asylum,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.769
still waiting
for an interview.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.039
Process shouldn't be
that complicated.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.908
It's why I started this place.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.243
To help others
apply for asylum

13:30.343 --> 13:31.811
and find housing,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.547
sometimes just give them
a sense of community.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.782
The loneliness can be

13:35.883 --> 13:37.918
the worst part.
I can imagine.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.187
When you were
working with Elena,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.290
did you meet the Perezes?
Of course.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.791
I introduced them to Elena.

13:44.892 --> 13:48.728
She wanted to take them in,
to set an example.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.465
I have to ask this.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.636
Do you think there's any chance
that Jaime did this?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.571
Absolutely not.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.807
Jaime was grateful to Elena.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.810
He would not have
harmed her, I promise you.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.380
Excuse me.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.950
Hey, Dante. What's up?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.318
Elena's husband called.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.220
He finally went home,
looked around.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.555
Said one of her necklaces
was missing.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.324
A pretty valuable one.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.792
Someone broke in
and only stole one necklace?

14:19.893 --> 14:21.261
Maybe Elena surprised
the burglar

14:21.361 --> 14:22.930
before he had a chance
to steal anything else.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.065
Her husband send you
a picture of the necklace?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.566
He did.
I'll text it to you.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.401
Yeah, I'll have Harry
look into it.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.838
The case file
you asked for, Detective.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.173
Thank you, Schaffer.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.845
Where are you hiding, Lo-Lo?

14:42.682 --> 14:44.717
You're very talented, Robby.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.988
But to get where
I believe you can be,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.157
you're gonna
need to practice.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.593
There's a wonderful
fine arts program at Pratt.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.295
I think you'd do well there.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.697
I have a friend at the school
I could put you in touch with,

14:57.797 --> 14:59.332
if you're interested.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.733
Definitely.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.770
If it's no trouble.
It's no trouble at all.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.939
All right.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.675
How long has your family lived
in this neighborhood?

15:09.809 --> 15:10.877
A while.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
Any siblings?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.185
Robby?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.289
A brother.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.792
That's it.
Right up there.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.168
Robby...

15:35.268 --> 15:38.171
I'm always in the studio
an hour before class,

15:38.271 --> 15:41.074
if you ever want to
stop by early to work.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.709
Thanks.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.138
What is going on with you, son?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.860
Robby, what are you
running from?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.462
<i>Hey.</i>

16:35.562 --> 16:37.497
Any luck with the list
I sent you from Elena's office?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.766
Mm. Not yet.
What about
the former roommate?

16:39.866 --> 16:43.103
Well, turns out there weren't
any photos to sell after all.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.504
Plus she lives in Alaska.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.706
I did get a hit
on Elena's stolen jewelry.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.041
Oh, what'd you find?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.576
It was sold to a shop
in the Jewelry District

16:49.676 --> 16:50.943
two days ago.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.013
The day before Elena's murder?
Yeah, exactly.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.484
I'm hacking into the security
footage of the shop right now.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.786
This is the time
of the sale.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.990
Okay.
Who do we have here?

17:04.091 --> 17:06.459
That's Carmen Santos

17:06.559 --> 17:07.860
and that's Marisol Perez.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.363
Why is Jaime's wife
selling Elena's necklace?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.233
That's a good question.
I hate to say this,

17:13.333 --> 17:14.767
but maybe we got this one wrong.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.603
If Elena's necklace
was stolen,

17:16.703 --> 17:17.604
and she found out,

17:17.704 --> 17:18.905
and confronted Jaime,

17:19.005 --> 17:20.740
maybe he's not
so innocent after all.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.619
We've got surveillance
footage of

17:32.719 --> 17:33.786
Carmen Santos
and Marisol Perez

17:33.886 --> 17:35.722
selling Elena's
stolen necklace.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.457
HARRY
Rob, we're starting to doubt
Jaime's innocence.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.292
Well, it definitely
doesn't look good.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.693
Well, so what?

17:40.793 --> 17:41.494
The three of them
were in on it together?

17:41.594 --> 17:42.929
Carmen did say

17:43.029 --> 17:44.531
she connected
Marisol and Jaime with Elena.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.066
Okay, so Carmen orchestrated
the whole thing--

17:47.167 --> 17:49.001
a scam to steal from Elena.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.603
But then it spiraled
out of control.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.472
You know, I think you might be
on the right track.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.574
Carmen's bank statements
show a series of

17:54.674 --> 17:57.009
large cash deposits
going back 18 months.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.879
That's a lot of dough
for a nonprofit worker.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.514
So this wasn't her first scam.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.982
No, definitely not.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.684
I got Carmen's arrest record
here in Venezuela.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.086
She served time for
"administrative irregularities,"

18:07.187 --> 18:08.621
aka fraud.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.989
What do you think, Rob?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.426
I think I'm about to
get some answers.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.343
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

18:30.443 --> 18:31.811
<i>¿Sí?</i>

18:36.783 --> 18:38.885
What happened?
Is it Jaime?

18:38.985 --> 18:41.921
No, I'm here about
something else.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.823
Elena's husband said
he noticed

18:43.923 --> 18:45.892
one of her necklaces
was missing.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.727
You want to tell me
about that?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.266
Somebody better start
talking right now.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.801
I know how this must look,

18:54.901 --> 18:57.036
but we didn't steal
the necklace.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.505
Elena gave it to me.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.107
Jaime and I needed
the money.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.543
We wouldn't be able to get
our work permits for months.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.077
And I sold it for them

19:05.178 --> 19:07.647
because they don't yet
have valid IDs.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.549
If they'd tried to
sell it on the street,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.984
they'd only get
a fraction of the price.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.554
You don't believe us,
do you?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.389
You don't exactly
have proof.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.859
And the one person who could
verify your story is gone.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.962
And then there's the matter of
those large cash deposits

19:23.062 --> 19:24.197
in your account.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.700
Many of our donors
send money to me directly,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.436
so I can get it
to the people here

19:29.536 --> 19:30.837
without the usual
red tape.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.572
You mean without
following the law.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.708
And what about your prison
time in Venezuela?

19:38.278 --> 19:41.248
I spoke out against
corruption in the government,

19:41.348 --> 19:43.850
so they trumped up a charge
and they threw me in prison.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.018
As soon as I got out,
I came here.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.054
I'm lucky to be alive.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.091
This is all very compelling.
It's true.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.262
Carmen is the kindest, most
honest person I've ever met.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.731
She fed my family after
we'd been on a bus for days.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.467
She took my children
to the zoo,

20:00.567 --> 20:01.501
so they got to be

20:01.601 --> 20:03.603
normal kids
for a few hours.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.473
Everything that
we are saying is true.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.743
Please. Don't give up
on my husband.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.881
I won't.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.184
I'm still on the case.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.686
Thank you.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.024
Never thought when we finally
made it to America,

20:25.124 --> 20:27.794
we'd be despised
by everyone.

20:28.695 --> 20:29.762
Not everyone.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.664
It feels that way.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.767
At Elena's home,
protesters stood outside

20:34.867 --> 20:38.471
just to yell insults--
"Stop the alien invasion."

20:38.571 --> 20:39.772
One guy showed up
every night,

20:39.872 --> 20:42.041
just kept saying it
over and over.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.376
Every night?

20:43.476 --> 20:44.844
Can you describe
what he looked like?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.614
I remember he was tall,

20:47.714 --> 20:50.016
with a, um, a goatee

20:50.116 --> 20:52.785
and a birthmark
above his eye.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.489
Hey, so I cross-referenced
Marisol's description

20:56.589 --> 20:58.391
with the list
from Elena's office

20:58.491 --> 20:59.359
of people making threats.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.660
Texting you a pic

21:00.760 --> 21:02.929
of Clay Miller.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.897
What do we know
about this guy Clay?

21:04.997 --> 21:07.800
NRA member,
active hunting license

21:07.900 --> 21:09.836
and he was on an extremist
podcast last month,

21:09.936 --> 21:12.439
voicing his very strong viewpoints

21:12.539 --> 21:13.673
about the migrant crisis.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.974
And let me guess.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.275
He wants to welcome them
with open arms?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.210
Yeah, more like firearms.
And get this,

21:18.311 --> 21:20.813
this guy took
particular aim at Elena

21:20.913 --> 21:23.082
saying that people like her
should be taken out

21:23.182 --> 21:25.418
in order to preserve
American values.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.819
Can you track this guy down,

21:26.919 --> 21:28.087
have a little chat?

21:28.187 --> 21:30.690
Yeah.
Always up for a field trip.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.696
Come on, come on.
Where are you, Robby?

21:42.802 --> 21:44.904
Let's go!
Come on!

21:45.805 --> 21:47.239
Robby?

21:48.675 --> 21:49.809
You okay?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.645
Get in the car,
get in the car.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.885
What are you doing here?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.186
How'd you
know where I was?

22:00.286 --> 22:01.821
I've been looking
for you for hours.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.290
Why did you leave that house
after I dropped you off?

22:04.391 --> 22:06.158
Is that even your home?

22:08.795 --> 22:09.862
Do you live
on the streets?

22:09.962 --> 22:12.064
Is that what's going on?

22:12.965 --> 22:16.669
If you tell me the truth,
I might be able to help you.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.372
I don't live on the streets.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.075
But my brother does.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.879
I spend a few hours every day
looking for him.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.015
I don't understand.
Why--?

22:29.115 --> 22:31.017
Why doesn't your brother
live with you?

22:31.117 --> 22:34.521
Our parents died
in a car crash five years ago.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.288
We got put
in the system.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.158
You were separated?
Not at first.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.161
We were placed
together, but...

22:42.261 --> 22:44.731
our foster father,
he drank a lot,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.132
and then
he'd come after us.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.701
Darius usually got
the worst of it.

22:48.801 --> 22:52.739
After a few months Darius said
we needed to get out of there.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.508
So we made a plan
to leave that night,

22:55.608 --> 22:57.209
while everyone was asleep.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.578
Darius went first,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.012
hopped out
our bedroom window,

23:00.112 --> 23:02.649
climbed to
the ground, but...

23:02.749 --> 23:06.052
our foster dad,
he woke up.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.688
I heard him coming down
the hall and I...

23:10.289 --> 23:13.926
I just froze.
I was so scared.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.795
Darius waited
as long as he could,

23:15.895 --> 23:17.497
but he had to go.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.066
Without me.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.170
Robby...

23:24.270 --> 23:25.505
I'm so sorry.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.275
Are you still in that home?

23:29.375 --> 23:30.843
No.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.581
I got placed in a new one.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.616
They're awesome, but...

23:36.716 --> 23:39.218
now that I'm in a new home,

23:39.318 --> 23:41.821
Darius can't find me
even if he tries.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.592
Darius is the graffiti artist
in your paintings,

23:45.692 --> 23:47.794
standing by himself,

23:47.894 --> 23:50.029
away from the family.

23:50.897 --> 23:51.998
I've got to find him.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.500
I was hoping that...

23:53.600 --> 23:55.868
You were hoping that
those boys might know him.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.138
It's not your fault.

23:59.238 --> 24:02.041
You were just
scared kids.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.944
Let's get you home.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.914
I wouldn't want your
foster parents to worry.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.325
We should wait
outside for him.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.327
I'll protect you.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.330
Clay Miller?

24:24.430 --> 24:25.865
Who's asking?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.400
Just fellow gun enthusiasts.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.269
We heard you
on that podcast.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.605
You had some very
insightful things to say

24:32.705 --> 24:34.140
about Congresswoman Acevedo.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.776
So what? Last I checked,
it's a free country.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.110
Yeah, no, you're right,

24:38.210 --> 24:39.979
which is why you had
every right to protest

24:40.079 --> 24:41.548
in front of her house
several times

24:41.648 --> 24:44.851
before, you know,
she got killed. Look...

24:44.951 --> 24:46.218
I don't know
who the hell you are,

24:46.318 --> 24:48.287
but unless you got
a badge or a warrant,

24:48.387 --> 24:49.455
get lost.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.757
If you'd prefer to
talk to the cops,

24:50.857 --> 24:51.924
we can certainly
arrange that.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.860
Are you threatening me?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.327
'Cause I got to tell you,

24:55.427 --> 24:57.329
I'm a little tired of shooting
at these paper targets.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.365
I'd be ready
for the real thing.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.903
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

25:04.003 --> 25:06.438
What the hell's going on here?
Clay, you okay, man?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.340
These two are trying to
pin a murder on me.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.843
You might want to
get the hell out of here.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.178
We just need a word
with Clay here

25:12.278 --> 25:13.079
and we're gonna get
out of your hair.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.247
Like hell you will.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.518
Babe!

25:22.021 --> 25:23.756
Stay right there.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.602
Okay, easy, Clay.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.170
You don't want to make
a mistake you can't take back.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.471
Shut up!
I need to think.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.473
We honestly just want to
talk to you.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.210
Back off.
I'm backing up.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.745
Man...

25:45.845 --> 25:47.446
You really blew
this one, babe.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.982
I mean, I can't believe
you thought

25:50.082 --> 25:51.417
this was gonna work.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.285
Quiet.
Of all the stupid ideas--

25:53.385 --> 25:54.887
and you've had,
like, some doozies--

25:54.987 --> 25:57.724
l-like the time you hired
your ex-boyfriend to install

25:57.824 --> 25:59.926
surveillance cams and
then he hacked the feed?

26:00.026 --> 26:02.228
Shut up!
And that was pretty boneheaded.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.863
Don't talk to me like that.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.464
Quit it already.
I told you we should've

26:05.564 --> 26:06.766
waited for him
in the parking lot.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.034
Yeah, because
that stroke of genius

26:08.134 --> 26:09.335
would've made
all the difference.

26:09.435 --> 26:10.569
So typical Mel!

26:10.670 --> 26:12.171
You know, always
deflecting with sarcasm!

26:12.271 --> 26:14.674
You know, you never admit
you make any mistakes!

26:14.774 --> 26:16.943
Enough!
You want to hear a mistake?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.410
Marrying you!

26:18.510 --> 26:21.380
That was the biggest
mistake of my life.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.381
Shut up.

26:22.481 --> 26:23.983
Shut the hell up!

26:25.351 --> 26:27.486
Nope. No, you don't.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.522
Nice job, babe.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.060
You've been watching
<i>Moonlighting</i> reruns again,

26:34.160 --> 26:36.729
haven't you?
It was so much better
before they got together.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.667
Well, have Dante pick him up.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.602
Sounds like he earned
a night in holding.

26:46.839 --> 26:47.874
Hey.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.541
2004 Syrah.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.810
What happened?

26:50.910 --> 26:52.812
You know the student
I told you about?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.914
He almost got himself
beat up tonight.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.216
And I know it's gonna
happen again,

26:57.316 --> 26:59.451
and there's not a darn thing
I can do about it.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.921
Well, what's the problem?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.489
He's trying to track his brother

27:03.589 --> 27:05.024
who ran away from
their foster home.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.093
His brother's a...
a graffiti artist,

27:07.193 --> 27:10.562
so every night,
my student is going out there

27:10.663 --> 27:13.265
asking taggers
if they've seen him.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.603
You know...

27:20.673 --> 27:23.642
NYPD keeps
a database of taggers.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.345
Names, known addresses.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.747
Really?

27:27.847 --> 27:30.182
Would you ask
Detective Dante

27:30.282 --> 27:31.583
to look into it for me?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.153
Sure.
I'll call him in the morning.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.255
No guarantees.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.258
Understood.

27:40.326 --> 27:43.529
You are the best.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.007
You were spotted outside
Congresswoman Acevedo's house

27:55.107 --> 27:57.744
several nights
before she died.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.646
It's a public sidewalk,
isn't it?
Sure is.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.882
So tell me,
what happened next, Clay?

28:02.982 --> 28:04.550
Decided to kick
your protest up a notch?

28:04.650 --> 28:08.087
You got it all wrong.
She's the culprit here, not me.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.321
Care to elaborate?

28:09.421 --> 28:10.957
I missed your guest spot
on the podcast.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.762
I owned a construction
business for 15 years.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.496
Then these migrants
start coming in,

28:17.596 --> 28:20.599
and I start getting underbid by
crews using their cheap labor.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.568
I lost everything.
So, you were angry?

28:22.668 --> 28:25.337
Damn right I was angry.
I've got a family to support.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.640
And Acevedo's out there
protecting illegals?

28:28.741 --> 28:29.942
How's that fair?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.044
Ever stop to think
Acevedo's policies

28:32.144 --> 28:34.480
would've given those migrants
the right to work?

28:34.580 --> 28:36.148
How's that help me?

28:36.248 --> 28:38.184
If those migrants weren't forced
to take low-paying,

28:38.284 --> 28:40.419
under-the-table jobs
just to survive,

28:40.519 --> 28:42.721
your competitors
wouldn't be able to outbid you.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.591
Helps you just as much as them.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.695
The guy had a gun to my
husband's head a few hours ago,

28:49.796 --> 28:51.931
and now he's playing
the sympathy card?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.033
No one wants to be the villain
in their own story.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.802
Clearly this guy has
a lot of hate.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.503
Question is,
how far did he take it?

28:57.603 --> 28:58.805
So, you blamed

28:58.905 --> 29:00.206
the congresswoman
for losing your business,

29:00.306 --> 29:02.174
and you decided to do something
about it, that it?

29:02.274 --> 29:03.242
Yeah.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.543
But I didn't
want to kill her.

29:04.643 --> 29:05.912
You just wanted to hurt her.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.080
No, I just wanted to
force her out of office.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.549
That's why I was protesting
in her neighborhood

29:10.649 --> 29:11.851
and putting up my yard signs.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.052
Yard signs?
That's right.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.586
I took a new batch
every night.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.288
Every night?
That's dedication.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.090
Damn right.

29:18.190 --> 29:22.261
And the day she died,
I put up my new serpent signs...

29:22.361 --> 29:23.729
shaped just like a snake.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.298
Said, "Acevedo is poisonous,
cut off her head."

29:27.466 --> 29:31.170
And you think this proves you
didn't murder the congresswoman?

29:32.538 --> 29:33.940
I didn't.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.508
Look, the news said
she was killed around 10:00.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.078
Well, I went straight home
after I put those signs up.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.713
Got back no later than 7:00.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.183
Don't believe me? Ask my wife.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.452
An unbiased witness.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.287
You can wait
in a holding cell

29:48.387 --> 29:50.189
while I verify that alibi.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.560
All right, let's go.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.062
Something on your mind?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.198
What Clay said about his sign.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.000
Elena's chief of staff
mentioned something

30:01.100 --> 30:02.668
about a serpent sign.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.404
So? She probably heard
about it from Elena.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.073
Yeah, but Clay just said
he put the sign out

30:07.173 --> 30:09.075
the night Elena was killed.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.244
And you told me Lacey hadn't
been to Elena's in days.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.013
At least that's
what she claimed.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.815
So, how'd she see the sign?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.450
And why'd she lie about it?

30:20.652 --> 30:24.323
All right, I just hacked
into Lacey's GPS records.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.025
Her phone didn't leave the house
the night of the murder.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.127
That doesn't mean Lacey
didn't leave her house.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.461
She could have left
her phone at home.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.396
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

30:30.496 --> 30:31.763
She's got an encrypted

30:31.864 --> 30:33.332
texting app on her phone.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.301
Does that mean we can't see
who she's texting with?

30:35.401 --> 30:37.003
Yeah, but we can read
her messages.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.405
This one was sent
the day Elena died.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.672
"Package received.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.775
Will be delivered
to her office tonight."

30:43.876 --> 30:45.444
The package?
What does that mean?

30:45.544 --> 30:48.780
I don't know. These were sent
yesterday and this morning.

30:48.881 --> 30:51.283
"Need to talk ASAP. Emergency!

30:51.383 --> 30:53.920
"Freaking out.
Need to talk now.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.654
Please do not ignore me."

30:55.754 --> 30:58.190
Sounds like she was
scared, desperate.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.059
We can use that
to our advantage.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.294
We need to ask Dante to
bring her in for questioning.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.630
Any chance you can trace
who Lacey was texting with?

31:04.730 --> 31:07.799
Over an encrypted app?
It's impossible.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.068
For the average hacker.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.836
I'll, uh, I'll see
what I can do.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.104
It'll take me a minute.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.839
Dante's on it.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.741
Okay, meantime, we need to find
out what was in that package.

31:15.841 --> 31:18.077
Well, whatever it was,
Lacey said she would deliver it

31:18.177 --> 31:20.246
to Elena's office
the night she was killed.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.581
Which means
it might still be there.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.422
You find anything?

31:30.522 --> 31:31.723
I'm coming up empty.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.525
Nothing yet.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.534
You found something?

31:42.634 --> 31:44.570
No. Nothing.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.072
Just more books.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.007
As a matter of fact, I think
this whole thing is a bust.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.976
We should just pack it up
and get out of here.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.144
Yeah, that sounds
like a plan.

31:56.182 --> 31:57.816
<i>So, maybe we trace</i>

31:57.916 --> 31:59.118
whoever the bug
is being broadcast to.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.419
It's not that
kind of device.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.254
It transmits over
a radio frequency.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.723
All right, so whoever knows
the frequency can listen in.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.725
Okay, so who would want to
spy on Elena?

32:06.825 --> 32:08.094
I mean, most of
Congress hates her,

32:08.194 --> 32:09.395
half of all registered voters,

32:09.495 --> 32:11.463
every single conservative
media outlet.

32:11.563 --> 32:12.864
Let's start with Congress.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.500
If anyone has access
to this kind of equipment,

32:14.600 --> 32:15.834
could be someone there.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.436
And Elena's migrant bill
was her most

32:17.536 --> 32:19.371
high-profile piece of legislation.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.673
So, who was her
biggest opposition?
Well...

32:21.773 --> 32:24.876
probably the guys drafting
the opposition bill in play--

32:24.977 --> 32:28.414
Darrin Nicholas,
Walter Grey and Jim Bristow.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.149
What are their stories?
Any red flags?

32:30.249 --> 32:31.984
Nicholas is a former ophthalmologist,

32:32.084 --> 32:34.586
joined Congress in 2010
during the Tea Party wave.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.422
Walter Grey represents

32:36.522 --> 32:38.857
a district upstate,
middle of his second term.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.726
Oh, and get this--

32:40.826 --> 32:42.894
before joining Congress,
Walter Grey

32:42.995 --> 32:44.430
was an FBI field agent

32:44.530 --> 32:46.932
who specialized in tactical surveillance.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.468
Sounds like he'd know
a thing or two about bugs,

32:49.568 --> 32:51.837
and encrypted text messaging
for that matter.

32:51.937 --> 32:55.307
He's got a history of turning
some really vocal opponents

32:55.407 --> 32:57.709
to flip at the very last second
and support his bills.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.811
I mean, I don't know,
maybe this is how he does it.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.881
Spies on his enemies, then
blackmails them into submission.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.151
Wait a minute,
Lacey mentioned that

33:05.251 --> 33:08.420
Bernie Jennings switched sides
on the migrant bill.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.056
Seemed odd for someone

33:10.156 --> 33:12.024
with such a progressive
voting record.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.425
This might explain why.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.528
So Grey uses Lacey
to plant his bug,

33:16.628 --> 33:18.030
Elena finds her in the act.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.598
Things get heated,
they struggle,

33:19.698 --> 33:22.801
and Lacey winds up
shooting Elena with her own gun.

33:22.901 --> 33:25.003
But why would they
leave the bug?

33:25.104 --> 33:26.772
Why not send
someone to grab it?

33:26.872 --> 33:28.440
Probably didn't get a chance.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.776
This place has been crawling
with cops since the murder.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.178
Well, h-hold on a minute.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.812
If the bug was active
during the shooting,

33:33.912 --> 33:35.347
maybe there's a recording
of the murder.

33:35.447 --> 33:39.351
And that tape would prove
Jaime's innocence.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.187
Yeah, but I mean,
how are we gonna get it?

33:41.287 --> 33:42.754
It's not like Grey's
just gonna give it up.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.856
I can think of someone
who might know where it is...

33:44.956 --> 33:45.991
Lacey.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.659
Maybe we can
get her to flip.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.130
Hi, Marcus.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.065
Was just about to call you.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.433
Did you find Lacey Young?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.634
We have a few things

33:55.734 --> 33:56.868
she might be able to
help us clear up.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.137
Yeah, I found her.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.806
Don't think she'll be
very helpful though.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.708
Why's that?

34:02.808 --> 34:03.975
Because she's dead.

34:16.622 --> 34:17.923
Lacey was shot
in her apartment.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.226
I'm not saying it was
Congressman Grey, but...

34:20.326 --> 34:21.527
If we find that recording,

34:21.627 --> 34:22.661
we can still link him
to the murder.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.196
How do we find that
without Lacey?

34:24.296 --> 34:26.265
I mean, the guy's got
four residences in his name,

34:26.365 --> 34:28.600
he's got an office in New York,
another one in D.C.,

34:28.700 --> 34:29.868
he's got bank deposit boxes--

34:29.968 --> 34:31.237
it could be in any one
of those places.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.571
Getting all those
search warrants

34:32.671 --> 34:34.740
for a sitting congressman
isn't gonna be easy.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.375
We may not have to.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.177
What are you thinking?

34:43.115 --> 34:44.450
Walter...

34:44.550 --> 34:48.086
I'm not gonna be able to
support you on the migrant bill.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.388
We...

34:49.488 --> 34:51.089
We did have an agreement,

34:51.190 --> 34:55.394
but... Elena's death
has changed things for me.

34:55.494 --> 34:59.131
Forced me to reexamine
my conscience.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.499
You pull your support now,

35:00.599 --> 35:02.401
there'll be consequences
neither of us wants.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.935
I understand the risk,

35:04.035 --> 35:06.538
but this is something
I need to do.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.945
Jennings is threatening
to defect.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.583
What do you want to do?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.754
Remind him why that
would be a very bad move.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.024
Understood.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.562
Thanks for your help, Congressman.

35:32.431 --> 35:35.434
I'm taking the risk
because I owe it to Elena.

35:35.534 --> 35:38.103
But your plan had
better work or...

35:38.204 --> 35:42.574
I had one weak moment
and Grey caught it.

35:42.674 --> 35:46.645
If he exposes me...
my career is over.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.546
I'll take that.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.615
Give it to me, now.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.485
Put the gun down now.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.620
Put it down, lady,
or I'll shoot.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.789
I'm in law enforcement.
Let me see your badge.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.191
I don't have it on me.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.827
Then put the gun down. Now.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.342
Stay down.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.794
You won't be needing
these anymore.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.130
Representative Jennings.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.866
And what do we have here?

37:17.436 --> 37:18.804
ELENA
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

37:18.904 --> 37:20.606
Elena, please don't.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.941
I didn't have a choice.
He made me do it.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.209
We always have a choice.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.745
Put down the phone. Please.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.013
Get away from me.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.648
Let go. Stop!

37:33.919 --> 37:36.822
By the time Jaime walked in,
Lacey fled.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.824
We all know
what happened next.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.359
Why did she do it?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.394
Turns out Congressman Grey
had proof that

37:42.494 --> 37:44.963
Lacey was stealing from
Elena's campaign fund.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.998
He threatened to end
her career in politics.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.468
Did they arrest this man?
Grey?

37:49.568 --> 37:51.002
Yes.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.838
We found this recording
on the congressman's aide.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.141
And his bullets matched
the one that killed Lacey.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.577
They're both going to prison.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.011
And Jaime?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.348
<i>Cariño.</i>

38:04.683 --> 38:06.318
<i>Gordito.</i>

38:08.454 --> 38:10.389
<i>Gordito.</i>

38:15.093 --> 38:17.996
How can we ever
thank you?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.198
It's not just me.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.833
Carmen is working on
finding you a place to live.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.202
And I've already found
Marisol a job--

38:24.302 --> 38:26.705
tutoring some of the children
in our community.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.007
I don't know
what to say.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.777
You've shown us
such love.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.480
Such generosity.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.147
We'll be grateful forever.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.350
You never should have been
in this position to begin with.

38:39.184 --> 38:42.354
I'm just happy to see
a little justice done.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.629
Why're you bringing me here?

38:50.729 --> 38:52.197
Hey, man, I told you
I didn't do nothing.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.065
Yeah, that spray paint just
happened to be in your hand.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.667
Got a live one here, Detective.
Thanks for bringing him in.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.604
I didn't tag that wall.
Calm down.
Not why you're here.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.105
Have a seat.

39:02.307 --> 39:03.875
I don't understand,

39:03.975 --> 39:05.811
why are we
in a police station?

39:08.547 --> 39:09.715
Darius?

39:09.815 --> 39:12.017
I thought I'd never
see you again.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.786
I missed you,
little man.
I missed you, too.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.321
Man, you got big.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.761
Thanks for helping me out.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.763
We're lucky Darius was
in the database.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.898
And Robby's lucky
to have you in his corner.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.934
I appreciate that.

39:30.168 --> 39:32.103
It's good to see you
again, Detective.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.272
Under better circumstances
this time.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.373
Oh, thank goodness.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.976
You know, I never
got a chance

39:38.076 --> 39:40.679
to really thank you for
everything you did

39:40.779 --> 39:42.681
for our family...

39:42.781 --> 39:44.983
when Robyn was taken.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.424
Just a little token
of my gratitude.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.593
Ms. Marsette...

39:54.693 --> 39:58.464
anytime you need a favor,
please feel free to call.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.435
Excuse me.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.940
This is Dante.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.209
Hey, Detective Hutchens
over here at the 8-9.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.979
I heard you were looking
into the Manny Ramirez case.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.313
Not sure what you're after...

40:15.413 --> 40:17.483
Whoa.
Not going after anything.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.250
Just trying to put a killer
behind bars.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.620
Yeah, well, that case
is our jurisdiction,

40:21.720 --> 40:24.690
and you're a little too close
to the victim anyway.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.525
So back off, Detective.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.236
It's kind of a miracle
that you found him.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.673
You know,
I-I do love a miracle.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.742
What's going on in here?
Hey.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.877
Well, my student
and his brother were

40:45.977 --> 40:47.045
reunited today,

40:47.145 --> 40:49.014
and Robby's foster parents

40:49.114 --> 40:52.017
have agreed to take
his brother in, too.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.720
Nice job, Auntie.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.388
Yes. Thank you.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.558
And I saw Detective Dante
at the station today.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.860
He says you've been
working hard on a case.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.130
Yes. A man was falsely
arrested for murder

41:05.230 --> 41:06.898
and his wife asked me
for help,

41:06.998 --> 41:08.299
and today,
he was released.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.536
What?
Well, look at that.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.604
Families being reunited
left and right.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.405
That's amazing, Mom.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.342
I cannot even imagine

41:17.442 --> 41:19.511
being separated
from my family.

41:19.611 --> 41:24.182
I mean, some kids, they have
no one to count on.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.852
I'm lucky to have so many
people that I can turn to.

41:26.952 --> 41:30.789
We will always, always
be there for you, baby.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.559
I love you both.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.226
Oh!
Aw...

41:35.326 --> 41:36.795
Here she comes, Mom.
Mm-hmm.
