00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:10.481 --> 00:12.613
What is with all the secrecy,
Mr. Davenport?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.014
Where are we?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.687
You are on
the 110th floor

00:16.687 --> 00:18.289
of Davenport Tower,

00:18.289 --> 00:20.691
the most technologically
advanced skyscraper

00:20.691 --> 00:22.123
in the world.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.055
And this...

00:24.055 --> 00:26.957
is your new home.

00:26.957 --> 00:29.630
Whoa, check out
that view.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.432
Seriously, this place
is amazing.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.304
Not bad, huh?

00:33.304 --> 00:35.636
This penthouse is where
I spent my years
as a bachelor.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.069
Boy, if these walls
could talk.

00:38.069 --> 00:40.741
Actually, they can talk.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.973
Walls off,
walls off.

00:42.973 --> 00:45.176
You know what?
Let's go out onto the terrace.

00:45.176 --> 00:46.777
I want to show
you something.

00:48.679 --> 00:51.622
This holographic emblem
represents your new team.

00:51.622 --> 00:54.755
Or as I like to call it,
an elite force.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.428
Cool. When do we get
to meet the others?

00:57.428 --> 00:58.459
Right now.

01:03.294 --> 01:05.196
I used a 3D hologram wall.

01:05.196 --> 01:07.198
Kaz, Skylar and Oliver
have been standing there

01:07.198 --> 01:08.939
the entire time.

01:08.939 --> 01:11.702
Five hours,
to be exact.

01:11.702 --> 01:13.874
Let's not forget
the two hours we spent

01:13.874 --> 01:15.576
rehearsing how to stand.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.679
Obviously, we needed
three hours,

01:18.679 --> 01:21.612
because you're still
not doing it right.

01:21.612 --> 01:23.614
It's great
to see you guys.

01:23.614 --> 01:26.187
What are they
doing here?

01:26.187 --> 01:29.019
Mighty Med hospital
was destroyed.

01:29.019 --> 01:30.060
What?

01:30.060 --> 01:32.393
This is all
that's left of it.

01:34.865 --> 01:37.027
Who would do
something like that?

01:37.027 --> 01:39.029
We don't know.

01:39.029 --> 01:41.702
We lost a lot of
superheroes that we cared about.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.505
We're not gonna stop
until we find
whoever's responsible.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.906
They wanted to use
my technology

01:45.906 --> 01:48.479
to track the criminals,
but I had a better idea.

01:48.479 --> 01:50.641
To create one
all-powerful team

01:50.641 --> 01:53.544
combining bionic heroes
and superheroes.

01:53.544 --> 01:56.187
Where are
the superheroes?

01:56.187 --> 01:58.689
You're looking
at 'em.

01:59.990 --> 02:03.594
Oh, yeah. Oliver
and I have super powers.

02:03.594 --> 02:06.697
What, did you fall into
a vat of radioactive waste?

02:06.697 --> 02:08.299
Wait, no.
Don't tell me.

02:08.299 --> 02:10.761
Bitten by
a supernatural spider.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.965
Don't be ridiculous.

02:14.965 --> 02:16.767
When we were trying
to stop my mother,

02:16.767 --> 02:18.769
also known as the evil
villain Mr. Terror,

02:18.769 --> 02:20.741
from becoming the most
powerful being on the planet,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.813
we made indirect contact
with the Arcturian space rock,

02:22.813 --> 02:25.916
which gave us a variety
of superhuman abilities.

02:25.916 --> 02:28.249
A magic space rock.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.922
And was that delivered by
a bunch of little green men?

02:31.922 --> 02:36.427
You do know that I'm from
another planet, right?

02:36.427 --> 02:40.561
I do now.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.563
You're gonna have to
excuse Chase.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.235
If you can't explain it
with science,

02:44.235 --> 02:46.967
it doesn't exist,
kinda like his social life,

02:46.967 --> 02:49.970
or his sense of humor
or his ability to have fun.

02:51.442 --> 02:53.274
Come on, Bree, do you
really expect me to believe

02:53.274 --> 02:54.705
that these two have...

02:59.550 --> 03:02.783
But that...
but the human body can't...

03:02.783 --> 03:06.116
I'm watching you,
fire boy.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.189
So can you shoot fire, too?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.592
No. Kaz has fire
and heat powers,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.023
and I have
water and ice.

03:13.023 --> 03:15.326
But we can both do this.

03:17.668 --> 03:19.900
Oliver, no!

03:19.900 --> 03:24.335
( sighs ) Well, it was
a good team while it lasted.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.540
What the...

03:29.540 --> 03:31.312
Wow, he's pretty good.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.983
Wait for it.

03:32.983 --> 03:34.545
( screaming )

03:38.389 --> 03:41.392
Sorry. Still working on
the landings.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.069
So how did you three
manage to escape

04:29.069 --> 04:31.071
before Mighty Med
was destroyed?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.404
We were off
capturing my mom.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.576
I mean, yeah,
she's an evil lunatic

04:35.576 --> 04:37.308
who will spend the rest
of her life in prison,

04:37.308 --> 04:40.050
but if it weren't for her,
we would've been killed.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.152
So... silver lining.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.656
You're an odd
little man.

04:47.217 --> 04:49.960
Not the first time
I've heard that.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.723
Okay, sleeping quarters
are all set.

04:52.723 --> 04:54.064
Guys on the right,
girls on the left.

04:54.064 --> 04:56.266
And the guy who
made it all possible

04:56.266 --> 04:58.929
will be in the giant room
at the end of the hall.

04:58.929 --> 05:00.671
Stay out of my pool.

05:00.671 --> 05:03.273
I'm just glad I finally
get to share my room

05:03.273 --> 05:04.905
with a girl.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.478
Me, too. Oh,
but don't forget,

05:07.478 --> 05:09.510
I'm from another planet,
so sometimes,

05:09.510 --> 05:11.241
I spit acid
in my sleep.

05:11.241 --> 05:13.313
Yeah? Well, that is
an upgrade,

05:13.313 --> 05:16.016
compared to what
comes out of my brothers.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.248
Hey, Mr. Davenport,

05:18.248 --> 05:20.391
we gotta start searching
for those guys who
destroyed our friends.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.623
Where's all that technology
you promised us?

05:22.623 --> 05:25.255
I'm so glad you asked.

05:25.255 --> 05:26.897
Hyperlift open!

05:30.801 --> 05:34.304
It's a voice-activated
secret passage!

05:34.304 --> 05:35.966
That is so awesome.

05:35.966 --> 05:39.309
And it seems like
such a fire hazard.

05:39.309 --> 05:41.672
I used my hydraloop
technology

05:41.672 --> 05:43.714
to create an elevator
that will take you

05:43.714 --> 05:46.717
from the penthouse to below
the earth's surface instantly.

05:46.717 --> 05:49.450
Step inside
and let me show you.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.652
Oh, wait.
Me first.

05:54.324 --> 05:57.388
Oh, FYI, I tend to get
sick on any ride

05:57.388 --> 05:59.660
that has a big...
drop!!

06:03.834 --> 06:05.496
Welcome to
mission command.

06:07.197 --> 06:10.771
And just like that,
we're back in the basement.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.704
This is your team's
central nervous system.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.506
This is where you'll
train, plan missions,

06:15.506 --> 06:18.449
learn how things work
before you touch them.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.811
( phone rings )

06:20.811 --> 06:23.454
Excuse me. I have a very
important Daven-call to take.

06:23.454 --> 06:25.285
You can't just
take it down here?

06:25.285 --> 06:28.088
I could, but then I wouldn't
get to ride the hyperlift again.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.321
Whoo!

06:33.193 --> 06:35.025
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

06:35.025 --> 06:36.527
I'm very uncomfortable
with that guy

06:36.527 --> 06:37.868
heading up this operation.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.772
All right, let's head out
and start searching

06:41.772 --> 06:44.374
for the lowlifes
who destroyed Mighty Med.

06:44.374 --> 06:47.207
But we don't even know
where to look.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.879
We have to look somewhere.

06:48.879 --> 06:50.781
We'll go city by city,
starting here.

06:50.781 --> 06:53.013
You guys take uptown,
we'll take downtown.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.618
We don't just go
randomly looking for people.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.219
We have to devise
a plan first.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.522
We just did.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.125
Uptown, downtown.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.927
I don't really know
any other parts of town,

07:06.927 --> 07:07.998
so plan commenced.

07:15.506 --> 07:18.509
Now it feels like home.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.644
( eerie whirring noise )

07:29.319 --> 07:32.282
( whirring noise continues )

07:36.727 --> 07:39.730
Okay, the cyber desk
is compiling a database

07:39.730 --> 07:41.361
of all the superheroes
in the hospital

07:41.361 --> 07:42.993
that someone might've
had a grudge against.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.596
In the meantime,
I still need to know
more about you guys.

07:45.596 --> 07:47.938
Well, I'm 5'10",

07:47.938 --> 07:50.771
I'm a hearty mix
of Irish and German,

07:50.771 --> 07:54.004
and I've been known
to lie about my height.

07:55.946 --> 07:58.248
I meant what other
magical powers

07:58.248 --> 08:00.150
do you have?

08:00.150 --> 08:02.382
Uh, I have super strength.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.214
- ( both scoff )
- You?

08:04.214 --> 08:06.587
Yes, me.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.318
Why does everyone
act so surprised
when I say that?

08:08.318 --> 08:10.821
Because we can see
your ribcage through
your shirt.

08:12.823 --> 08:14.424
DAVENPORT:
Guys, get up here.

08:14.424 --> 08:16.296
There's something
strange going on.

08:20.831 --> 08:23.033
Whoa, that is strange.

08:23.033 --> 08:26.977
Not that. Outside.
Something flew by the window.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.880
I know something that's
gonna fly out the window.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.883
I'm serious. There is
something out there.

08:37.988 --> 08:39.219
Get down!

08:54.835 --> 08:57.167
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.712
Look. There's
something on the floor.

09:01.712 --> 09:05.145
Yeah, about $36,000
worth of glass.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.017
No.

09:07.017 --> 09:09.980
It's some sort
of gift box.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.422
Stop! Dude,
what are you doing?

09:14.024 --> 09:15.886
You gotta open
the card first.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.858
No.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.690
Don't open anything.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.892
It could be rigged
to blow this place apart.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.995
I'll use my bionic eye
to scan it.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.901
It's a flash drive.

09:30.901 --> 09:33.674
I could download its contents
onto my internal hard drive

09:33.674 --> 09:36.146
and play it back for everyone
in mission command.

09:36.146 --> 09:37.978
Who would blast our penthouse
just to toss a flash drive

09:37.978 --> 09:39.509
in the window?

09:39.509 --> 09:42.382
That's why you gotta
open the card first.

09:48.158 --> 09:49.890
It's a video message.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.597
Destroying your little hospital
was just the beginning.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.000
We're on the hunt
for every superhero

10:00.000 --> 10:02.072
that remains,
and soon,

10:02.072 --> 10:04.404
they will all
be extinct.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.777
And once you've
watched us eliminate them,

10:06.777 --> 10:10.981
we're coming for you,
Oliver, Kaz and Skylar.

10:10.981 --> 10:14.284
And anyone else
dumb enough to protect you.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.889
Who was that?

10:18.889 --> 10:21.051
And don't say
check the card first.

10:21.051 --> 10:23.724
Whoever it was,
it's obvious they've
been watching us.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.857
I'm gonna go activate
the penthouse security
perimeter,

10:26.857 --> 10:27.898
and get those windows replaced.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.933
See? This is exactly
why I wanted to go out

10:32.933 --> 10:34.705
and find them first.

10:34.705 --> 10:36.436
As soon as we
finalize a plan--

10:36.436 --> 10:38.238
Forget your plan.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.741
If we don't stop them,
they're gonna take out

10:40.741 --> 10:42.673
every last superhero,
including us.

10:42.673 --> 10:45.275
They're gonna take us out
a lot faster

10:45.275 --> 10:46.616
if we go into this thing
unprepared.

10:46.616 --> 10:49.780
Look, I wanna
find them, too.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.182
But we have to be smart
about this.

10:52.182 --> 10:54.224
We have no idea
what we're up against.

10:54.224 --> 10:56.056
He's right, Kaz.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.228
We have to be careful.

10:58.228 --> 11:01.291
Skylar, back me up
on this.

11:01.291 --> 11:04.564
We'll get 'em.
It's just gonna
take some time.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.367
Oliver?

11:08.498 --> 11:10.871
Oh, come on.
Not you, too.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.374
Dude, we have to do this
for Mighty Med.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.706
I know.

11:15.706 --> 11:18.178
I just...

11:18.178 --> 11:19.649
I think we should
play it safe.

11:19.649 --> 11:21.712
Safe?

11:21.712 --> 11:25.115
None of us are safe
with those two on the loose.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.458
You know...

11:28.458 --> 11:31.121
I never thought being
part of an elite force

11:31.121 --> 11:33.463
would mean sitting around
and doing nothing.

11:38.268 --> 11:41.471
Hey, what are you
still doing up?

11:41.471 --> 11:43.173
I don't know.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.806
Guess I'm not really used to
sleeping in a new place.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.908
Plus, Skylar snores.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.781
Your capsule's soundproof.

11:50.781 --> 11:52.442
I know.

11:53.643 --> 11:56.446
Mr. Davenport,
I can't find Kaz.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.418
I thought he was
in his bed snoring,

11:58.418 --> 12:01.651
but it turned out
to be Skylar down the hall.

12:01.651 --> 12:04.694
I bet he went off to find
those guys on his own.

12:04.694 --> 12:06.897
I'll use my super speed
to bring him back.

12:06.897 --> 12:09.359
Oliver, go wake
Chase and Skylar.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.461
If you're not back
with Kaz in two minutes,

12:11.461 --> 12:13.203
I'm gonna have them track you
on your GPS locator.

12:13.203 --> 12:15.435
Please. Two minutes?

12:15.435 --> 12:18.408
With my upgraded speed,
I can search the entire
city in less than 30 seconds.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.070
( mocking )
Oh, I'm so fast.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.912
- Well, then, go!
- Okay!

12:27.517 --> 12:29.920
Okay, if I can find
the costume shop

12:29.920 --> 12:31.782
that sold those guys
their masks,

12:31.782 --> 12:33.683
maybe I can
track them down.

12:33.683 --> 12:36.686
Eighty-six costume shops
in one city?

12:36.686 --> 12:39.029
What are you people
trying to hide?

12:40.690 --> 12:42.833
Ah!

12:42.833 --> 12:46.166
I mean...
( flatly ) Aha, I found you!

12:51.802 --> 12:54.474
Wait.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.046
I know you guys.

12:56.046 --> 12:57.577
You're Roman and Riker.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.349
Your dad is
the superhero Rodissius.

12:59.349 --> 13:01.812
Was a superhero.

13:01.812 --> 13:05.085
Until you got
your hands on him
at Mighty Med.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.057
What are you talking about?
We saved his life.

13:07.057 --> 13:09.289
You took away
his powers.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.061
We had no choice.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.923
Sacrificing his powers was
the only way to keep him alive.

13:12.923 --> 13:14.464
You took away
the only thing

13:14.464 --> 13:16.266
that made him special,

13:16.266 --> 13:18.768
and forced him to live
his life as a mortal.

13:18.768 --> 13:22.933
That's a punishment
far worse than death.

13:22.933 --> 13:26.436
That's a warped way
of looking at that,
but all right.

13:26.436 --> 13:30.610
Our father may not
have the power to take revenge,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.414
but we do.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.745
There you are.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.419
Hello.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.593
These are the guys
who destroyed Mighty Med.

13:43.593 --> 13:47.757
Oh, come on.
Why are the bad ones
always so cute?

13:49.259 --> 13:52.632
Okay, Bree, you can go.
I got this.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.744
You know,
on second thought,

14:04.744 --> 14:07.377
Bree, would you mind
sticking around?

14:12.883 --> 14:15.285
Now you see why it's a bad idea
to run off without a plan?

14:15.285 --> 14:18.989
In hindsight, probably
not my best decision.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.262
What is that?

14:22.262 --> 14:24.334
Meet the guys
who destroyed Mighty Med.

14:24.334 --> 14:25.835
They're shape shifters.

14:25.835 --> 14:27.367
Oh, okay.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.040
What the heck
are shape shifters?!

14:30.040 --> 14:31.741
They can morph
into anything--

14:31.741 --> 14:34.204
a person, a thing,
a deadly black cloud.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.845
Get down!

14:40.350 --> 14:41.881
Chase, now would be
a great time

14:41.881 --> 14:43.413
for one of your plans.

14:43.413 --> 14:44.985
Oh, now you want a plan?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.257
If you had followed
my plan in the first place,

14:47.257 --> 14:48.658
we wouldn't even
be in this mess.

14:48.658 --> 14:50.490
I didn't ask you guys
to show up.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.192
I didn't wanna show up.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.623
- I was sleeping.
- BOTH: We know.

14:53.623 --> 14:57.467
( all arguing )

14:57.467 --> 14:59.799
Hey!

14:59.799 --> 15:01.201
Where'd they go?

15:09.179 --> 15:10.840
I can still hear them.

15:18.548 --> 15:21.691
Uh... guys.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.056
Is everybody okay?

15:56.056 --> 15:58.328
Think so.

15:58.328 --> 16:00.560
Did we win?

16:00.560 --> 16:07.437
Wait.
Where's Skylar?

16:07.437 --> 16:09.139
Skylar!

16:11.841 --> 16:14.204
They took her.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.681
I can't believe you
let them take Skylar,

16:21.681 --> 16:23.513
all because you couldn't
work together as a team.

16:23.513 --> 16:25.185
It's not my fault.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.956
He's the one who
took off on his own.

16:26.956 --> 16:29.119
It doesn't matter.
You're a leader.

16:29.119 --> 16:31.591
It's your responsibility
to look out for them.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.165
No, Chase is right.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.327
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.499
From now on,
we work together

16:39.499 --> 16:41.201
instead of
against each other.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.478
Good.

16:48.478 --> 16:50.310
Now how do we find Skylar?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.882
Without a way to track her,
it's almost impossible.

16:52.882 --> 16:55.014
They could've
taken her anywhere.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.786
Normally when I'm
looking for her,

16:56.786 --> 17:00.019
I just follow
her sweet flowery scent.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.892
That's probably
not gonna work today.

17:02.892 --> 17:04.854
Whatever we do,
we have to move fast.

17:04.854 --> 17:06.696
Without her powers,

17:06.696 --> 17:08.658
she doesn't stand a chance
against those guys.

17:08.658 --> 17:11.000
Let's check the video again.
Maybe we missed something.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.362
Don't bother.

17:12.362 --> 17:14.003
I scoured every frame
of that video.

17:14.003 --> 17:15.835
There's nothing there
that can help us.

17:15.835 --> 17:19.008
Not even this faded number
on the sign behind them?

17:19.008 --> 17:22.142
( sheepish guffaw )

17:22.142 --> 17:25.175
Oh, come on. You have
some mystical super power

17:25.175 --> 17:27.777
that allows you
to see that?

17:27.777 --> 17:29.819
Yeah, it's called eyesight.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.183
Hey, wait.

17:33.183 --> 17:35.024
There's more to it,
but it's covered with dirt.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.387
If I do a spectral
isolation scan,

17:37.387 --> 17:39.659
I can contrast the elements
to see what's under there.

17:50.740 --> 17:55.105
It's the subway station
at 128th Street.

17:55.105 --> 17:58.178
There is no subway station
at 128th Street.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.311
I mean, there was one
40 years ago when I was...

18:01.311 --> 18:03.313
ten years from being born.

18:05.415 --> 18:08.888
But the city abandoned it
after a really bad flood.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.920
Wait.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.223
Shape shifters naturally
dwell in dark, cavernous spaces.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.595
That must be where
they're keeping Skylar.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.398
- Let's go.
- I'll send the directions
to your chip.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.730
You can still get there through
an old underground tunnel.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.072
I used to play there
40 years ago when I was...

18:23.072 --> 18:25.505
You know, I'll send
you the directions.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.414
Well, well, well.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.816
Skylar Storm.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.519
Looks like
you lost this battle.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.251
You won't
get away with this.

18:41.251 --> 18:42.752
My team will find me.

18:42.752 --> 18:44.924
I'm sure they will.

18:44.924 --> 18:48.027
But it'll be too late
for you.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.859
By the time they get here,

18:49.859 --> 18:51.961
we'll be on to
our next superhero.

18:51.961 --> 18:55.265
And the next,
and the next

18:55.265 --> 18:57.467
until all of you
are destroyed.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.810
Yeah, if we can
actually find them.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.712
Hey!

19:02.712 --> 19:04.544
We'll find them.

19:06.316 --> 19:08.578
Because she's gonna
tell us

19:08.578 --> 19:11.951
exactly where they are.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.456
Get away from her!

19:16.456 --> 19:18.658
Hey, look who it is.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.361
You just made
the biggest mistake
of your lives.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.032
Let's do this.

19:24.194 --> 19:26.366
Oliver, use your strength
to free Skylar.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.744
Stop looking
so surprised.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.284
Great, they're doing
their dust bunny thing again.

19:53.663 --> 19:57.196
They're creating a ring
of centrifugal force around us.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.329
Guys, if we don't
do something fast,

19:59.329 --> 20:00.670
the force will crush us.

20:00.670 --> 20:04.834
Not gonna lie.
Kind of okay with this.

20:04.834 --> 20:07.507
Wait. If shape shifters
change their form

20:07.507 --> 20:09.679
by manipulating
their molecular
structures...

20:09.679 --> 20:11.010
Then there has to be a way
to freeze the molecules

20:11.010 --> 20:12.742
and stop the swarm.
That's it.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.745
Oliver has ice powers.
Oliver, use your cryo blast.

20:15.745 --> 20:16.886
Right!

20:20.890 --> 20:22.492
Keep blowing.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.162
It worked.

20:33.162 --> 20:34.834
It's frozen solid.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.206
We actually did it.
Good job, guys.

20:37.206 --> 20:40.370
Dude, that was a great
idea to mess with their
molecular structures.

20:40.370 --> 20:44.043
- It was your idea
to freeze the molecules.
- Yeah, but you're the one--

20:44.043 --> 20:46.045
Okay, we get it.
We're a team.

20:47.677 --> 20:50.480
Guys, get together.
Our first victory selfie.

20:52.322 --> 20:54.324
Silly face.

20:54.324 --> 20:56.956
( all talking at once )

21:16.606 --> 21:18.948
They got away?

21:18.948 --> 21:20.550
Yes, but this time,

21:20.550 --> 21:23.553
it was because
we were too good of a team.

21:23.553 --> 21:25.985
Oh, on the bright side,

21:25.985 --> 21:27.787
we have
a very cute selfie

21:27.787 --> 21:30.159
that captured
the exact moment
they escaped.

21:32.822 --> 21:34.063
That is a good one.

21:34.063 --> 21:37.226
You can't even
see my ribs.

21:37.226 --> 21:39.599
We've gotta warn
the rest of the superheroes,

21:39.599 --> 21:41.230
and let them know
they're being hunted.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.102
The good news is,

21:43.102 --> 21:44.704
Roman and Riker don't
even know where they are,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.406
so we should be able
to alert them first.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.409
Good, but it's still
gonna take some time.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.341
We got a lot of work
ahead of us.

21:51.341 --> 21:52.742
Let's get some sleep.

21:57.387 --> 21:59.118
Lights out.

22:09.298 --> 22:11.461
Now can we take them out?

22:11.461 --> 22:13.302
Not yet.

22:13.302 --> 22:15.164
Let them warn
the other superheroes

22:15.164 --> 22:16.966
that we're coming.

22:16.966 --> 22:18.468
That will lead us
right to 'em.

22:18.468 --> 22:21.811
Those fools
don't even realize it,

22:21.811 --> 22:25.314
but they just sealed
their friends' fates.
