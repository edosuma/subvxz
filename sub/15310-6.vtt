WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:07.675
This is way too much fun
for a first date.

00:07.708 --> 00:12.580
We should talk a little, just
so later on, we can say we did.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.947
Yeah. Okay.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.184
Um, so what do you want
to talk about?

00:16.217 --> 00:18.052
Well, why don't you tell me
something interesting

00:18.086 --> 00:20.188
about yourself.
And I already know you live

00:20.221 --> 00:22.856
in a doorman building,
so... that's

00:22.890 --> 00:25.926
a big check for you.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.728
Okay, uh, let's see.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.963
Uh, I'm a partner
at Gibson Dunn.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.200
Oh, another check.
Mmm.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.170
And I can tie a cherry stem
into a knot with my tongue.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.073
How you gonna top that?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.209
I have a daughter named Molly.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.812
Are you okay?

00:49.283 --> 00:52.353
So you faked a seizure?

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
I had to get out of there.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.691
What am I gonna do,
date a guy with a kid?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.128
It was the only way.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.643
He was attractive,
smart, successful.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.011
The total package.
But...

01:18.045 --> 01:19.580
he's dead to me now, so...

01:19.613 --> 01:21.249
what are you gonna do?

01:21.282 --> 01:24.084
Well, I don't get it.
What's the problem?

01:24.118 --> 01:26.154
The problem is
I don't do dads.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.821
Yeah, we know.
You don't do dads,

01:27.855 --> 01:30.258
you don't do guys with loafers,
you don't do chiropractors.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.325
Hey,

01:31.359 --> 01:33.161
if wearing a white coat
made you a doctor,

01:33.194 --> 01:36.197
I'd be getting a pelvic exam
from my butcher.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.665
You know, Kate,
if this guy's divorced,

01:37.698 --> 01:40.234
it's not like
he has the kid all the time.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.436
That's true.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.905
Maybe he doesn't
see the kid at all.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.876
Maybe he's a terrible father.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.078
Fingers crossed.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
All right, I'm gonna give him
another chance.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.450
We signed the lease
on the new house.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.785
We got it!

01:57.818 --> 01:59.387
All right!
Congratulations!
Wow!

01:59.420 --> 02:01.622
It has tons of natural light,

02:01.655 --> 02:03.391
ocean breeze,
plenty of extra space.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.159
It's perfect.
- Great.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.628
Maybe now we can all start
hanging out at your place.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.030
All right, just call first.

02:10.063 --> 02:12.566
We... are naked a lot.
Yeah.

02:13.867 --> 02:18.339
Remind me to put paper down
next time I sit on your couch.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.640
Well, if you guys
need furniture,

02:19.673 --> 02:21.642
you can have the red
armoire upstairs.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.145
You mean the red armoire
we all pitched in and bought you

02:25.179 --> 02:27.248
as a wedding gift?

02:28.882 --> 02:30.518
You hate it, don't you?

02:30.551 --> 02:33.721
No...
Well, let's just say that...

02:33.754 --> 02:35.823
one of us loves it
and one of us hates it,

02:35.856 --> 02:38.426
but I won't say who.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.936
Okay, Maddie Jane is
12 minutes past her nap

02:48.969 --> 02:51.905
so we have to skadoodle.
But are we clear

02:51.939 --> 02:53.341
on who's bringing

02:53.374 --> 02:55.276
what to the Mommy and Me
potluck?

02:55.309 --> 02:57.077
Yes.
Think so.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.313
And remember:
nut-free, sugar-free,

02:59.347 --> 03:01.415
gluten-free, dairy-free!

03:02.883 --> 03:06.687
That Maddie Jane is so gonna
end up on a stripper pole.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.491
Hey, will I see you
tomorrow?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.393
Rachel's working,
so I'll be taking Bethany

03:12.426 --> 03:14.328
to toddler hip-hop.
Oh, we will be there

03:14.362 --> 03:15.996
poppin' and lockin'.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.766
Oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
What?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.001
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh!

03:21.034 --> 03:23.737
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.874
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.209
Okay.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.783
You naughty girl.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.151
You got yourself
a little flirting buddy, do you?

03:38.185 --> 03:39.787
What? No.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.055
He wasn't flirting.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.457
Come on, Andi--
that arm touch?

03:43.491 --> 03:47.094
And the...
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-oh!

03:47.127 --> 03:48.562
He fancies you.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.865
Lowell...

03:51.899 --> 03:53.200
What are you even...

03:53.233 --> 03:56.637
Don't be silly,
you... silly.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.939
I really think
he was flirting with you.

03:58.972 --> 03:59.907
Get out of here.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.941
No, I'm telling you, Andi.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.009
No way.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.076
Andi, it looked like it to me.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.211
Shut up.
Okay.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.513
No, no, no.
Where are you going?

04:05.546 --> 04:06.914
We're in the middle
of a conversation.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.387
So, how are you feeling?

04:13.421 --> 04:15.789
Oh, you know how it is
with those rogue seizures.

04:15.823 --> 04:20.428
They just come and go with
no real medical explanation.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.962
You know, I couldn't help
but notice

04:21.995 --> 04:24.765
it coincided with me mentioning
my daughter Molly.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.668
Look, I had a seizure

04:27.701 --> 04:30.471
and that part of our history
isn't gonna change.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.541
But the truth is,
I... had a really great time

04:33.574 --> 04:36.176
the other night and I'm getting
on board with the idea

04:36.209 --> 04:37.711
that you have one. It.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.646
Her. Uh, Polly.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.014
Molly.
Yeah, Molly. Molly, yeah.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.550
Can't wait to meet her.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.352
Well, you can meet her
right now. She just got back

04:44.385 --> 04:45.986
from her mom's.
Hey, Molly?

04:46.019 --> 04:47.988
What? Here? Oh, no.
I don't have anything for her.
Yeah.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.590
Um, would she like
No.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.124
some lip gloss to play with?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.694
Or a Xanax to suck on?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.663
H-Here she is.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.331
Hi.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.132
I'm Molly.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.901
Well...

05:00.934 --> 05:03.971
aren't you a big girl.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.847
So silly.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.421
What?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.623
Oh, it's nothing.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.592
Something Lowell said earlier.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.060
What'd he say?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.363
Never mind.
It's totally ridiculous.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.964
Not even worth mentioning.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.033
Okay.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.202
Fine, I'll tell you.

05:35.235 --> 05:38.539
Okay. So, Lowell thinks
that this dad

05:38.572 --> 05:42.242
from Charlie's playgroup
was flirting with me.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.512
I mean, look at me.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.047
Isn't that just so crazy?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.052
That is crazy.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.562
It's not that crazy.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.264
I'm sorry. I-Is it just
totally unbelievable

06:04.297 --> 06:06.567
that someone
would find me attractive?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.268
No, you're beautiful.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.337
But you just said yourself
that you don't,

06:10.370 --> 06:15.208
right now,
have your usual curb appeal.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.377
"Curb appeal"?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.514
There's a phrase
I instantly regret.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.221
Hey, guys.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.923
I want you to meet
Kenneth's daughter,

06:29.957 --> 06:31.324
Molly.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.126
Hey.
Hey, how are you?
- Hi. This place

06:33.160 --> 06:35.195
is tragically hip,
and I love it.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.797
I'm totally
Instagramming this.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.567
She's so cool.
She Instagrams everything.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.973
Anyway, we just went shopping
and I bought the new iPhone.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.141
And since you are
the last person in the world

06:48.175 --> 06:49.543
who still uses a flip phone,

06:49.577 --> 06:52.212
I thought I would give
my old one to you.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.883
Oh, I don't know. I'm a bit wary
of all this new technology.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.685
No, honey, take it.
We can FaceTime.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.454
But we're having face time
right now.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.022
Plus,

07:02.055 --> 07:03.991
look, there's nothing wrong
with my phone.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.893
It's fine.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.196
Oh, my God, like in
the olden times.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.533
Okay, perhaps it's time
for an upgrade.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.736
Isn't this amazing?
I meet a great new guy,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.606
I get a cool new friend.
I mean, could it get any better?

07:18.639 --> 07:19.873
Want to go to Barneys?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.709
I work there--
we get a discount.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.144
Does anyone else
hear angels singing?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.979
Let's go.
Nice to meet you guys.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.682
Hey, Will.
Hi.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.850
Hey.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.118
Hi.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.220
I'm Molly.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.522
Uh, Will Stokes.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.857
Dr. Will Stokes.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.826
Local doctor.

07:39.727 --> 07:43.463
No.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.471
Perfect.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.677
There's a DVD wedged in here.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.911
Wonder what this is.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.947
Guys, look at that.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.416
I burned 180 calories
moving that.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.752
You know what that means:

08:04.785 --> 08:06.520
I've earned myself a cold beer.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.392
That's quite refreshing.
It's nice.

08:12.425 --> 08:16.163
Isn't it amazing
that a phone can do all this?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.965
Yeah, it was amazing.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.634
In 2007.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.136
You guys, look, it's Andi
and Bobby's honeymoon.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.038
Look at them, so
young and happy.

08:25.072 --> 08:28.275
Boy, that kid really has
done a number on 'em.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.712
Bob's on a Jet Ski.
Hey, Bob!

08:31.745 --> 08:34.414
He's waving and I'm waving back.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.483
Wow, nice hotel suite.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.951
Look at that.
They got a kitchen,

08:37.985 --> 08:40.554
four-poster bed...
And Andi naked.
Oh!

08:40.588 --> 08:42.489
Sex tape!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.858
This is a sex tape!

08:46.226 --> 08:47.661
Oh, Bob, go easy on her, mate.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.230
That's the mother
of your children.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.466
What the hell kind of position
are they getting into now?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.903
Whoa.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.939
She got that move
from me sophomore year.

08:58.972 --> 09:02.309
This was obviously intended
for a very different audience.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.711
We cannot watch this.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.747
We cannot watch
this again!

09:06.780 --> 09:07.981
Hmm.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.184
That is an unfortunate position
to pause in.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.887
You know,
for such a compact man,

09:13.921 --> 09:16.624
Bob has incredible
upper body strength.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.692
Okay. Listen,
we cannot let them know

09:18.726 --> 09:20.327
that we've watched this,
all right?

09:20.360 --> 09:23.463
Otherwise it's gonna be very
awkward for everybody forever.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.665
Surprise!

09:24.698 --> 09:25.833
Came to see the new place!

09:25.866 --> 09:27.167
Oh, my God, it's them.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.468
What do we... what do we...
what do we do?

09:28.501 --> 09:29.737
Everyone, stay calm.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
We are only as strong
as our weakest link.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.573
Right.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.777
Why are you looking at me?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.712
Oh, just act natural.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.719
What is that?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.821
You look like a cowboy
in a musical.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.990
I'm sorry. I can't
help it, all right?

09:50.023 --> 09:51.124
I'm nervous.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.559
Everything they say and do
is gonna remind me

09:52.592 --> 09:53.627
of what we just saw.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.263
TV's on. TV's on.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.166
Oh!
I got it. I-I got...

10:01.969 --> 10:04.504
Hurry up!

10:04.537 --> 10:06.606
We're waiting!

10:06.640 --> 10:09.710
Oh...
Wow.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.745
It's beautiful.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.314
Cute place.
What happened to the TV?

10:14.347 --> 10:15.315
Oh,

10:15.348 --> 10:16.650
it doesn't matter.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
Will's gonna buy us a new one.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.089
Well, anyway, I know that
we said we couldn't make it,

10:22.122 --> 10:25.592
but, uh, Bobby got off.
So we both came.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.700
Look at these floors.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.602
Oh, I love hardwood.
Yeah.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.137
She's not kidding.

10:37.170 --> 10:41.274
If it were up to her, she'd
put hard wood in everywhere.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.012
Well, anyway,
celebrate, right?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.080
Let's pop
this bad boy.
Yeah.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.315
Okay.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.449
Oh. Oh.
Ooh..

10:49.482 --> 10:50.784
Hey.
Oh.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.052
Honey, I'm sorry.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.121
I fizzed all over you.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.357
I have to move my car.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.134
It's Tom, the
flirting dad.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.103
Do I look okay?

11:10.137 --> 11:12.505
Mm, you're underdressed
for an e-mail,

11:12.539 --> 11:14.074
but okay for a phone call.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.043
Okay.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.177
Hi, Tom.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.112
Hey, Andi. Listen,

11:19.146 --> 11:21.749
I'm supposed to host
Mommy and Me next week, but...

11:21.782 --> 11:24.217
Bethany, don't put that
in your mouth!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.886
Uh, but I was wondering

11:25.919 --> 11:28.121
if maybe we could do it
at your house instead?

11:28.155 --> 11:31.859
Uh, sure, but I thought that
Rachel wanted to host it.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.326
Yeah, that's just it.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.295
Rachel and I are kind of, uh...

11:35.328 --> 11:37.397
We're splitting up.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.599
He and his wife
are splitting up.

11:39.632 --> 11:42.035
No!
Yes!

11:42.870 --> 11:45.205
I am so sorry to
hear that, Tom.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.240
It's okay. It's okay.
It's for the best.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.709
Anyway, I was wondering
if maybe I could get,

11:49.743 --> 11:51.311
like, five minutes alone
with you tomorrow,

11:51.344 --> 11:54.247
'cause there's something
I want to talk to you about,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.850
but right now,
Bethany is getting in the oven,

11:56.884 --> 11:59.019
so I should probably deal
with that.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.823
Oh, my God, he wants to
talk to me about something.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.525
So? It's not like
you've never talked before.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.327
Yeah, but before,
he had a spouse.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.796
It was all innocent.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.899
Now that they're splitting up,
the game has changed.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.269
You don't think he's leaving
his wife for me, do you?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.906
Maybe he's a chubby chaser.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.478
That's for me.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.147
I have a date.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.448
A date?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.050
Ooh, interesting.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.254
I want to be the first to see
what's wrong with this one.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.622
Hi, Kate.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.425
No!

12:57.644 --> 12:59.646
It is 2:00 in the morning.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.381
Where have you been?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.783
Okay, a much bigger question is,
what are you doing here?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.186
What happened?
I heard a woman scream.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.490
Kate, why
are you here?

13:10.523 --> 13:11.724
Mind your own business.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.927
How did you get to Molly?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.063
She got to me.
Found me online.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.166
Well, you absolutely
cannot date her.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.800
Well, why not?

13:20.834 --> 13:23.904
We danced, we made out.
I mean...

13:23.937 --> 13:25.438
What is that smell?

13:25.472 --> 13:28.208
It's a diaper full of poo.

13:30.010 --> 13:33.513
But go on about making out
with a 23-year-old.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.983
He's not gonna be making out
with her anymore.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.684
Why? You guys getting married?

13:39.286 --> 13:41.554
Look, Kate, in case
you haven't noticed,

13:41.588 --> 13:44.491
it hasn't exactly been
easy for me to meet women.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.059
It's true.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.996
The most action he gets is
squeezing into his bike shorts.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.699
I don't care, okay?

13:52.732 --> 13:54.501
I really like her dad,
and we cannot

13:54.534 --> 13:55.903
date a father/daughter combo!

13:55.936 --> 13:57.604
That is also true.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
Because if it works out for you,

13:59.139 --> 14:00.773
and it works out for her,
that would make her your...

14:00.807 --> 14:03.276
Exactly!
You cannot see her again!

14:03.310 --> 14:04.744
Come on.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.513
I don't want to have the kind
of mother-in-law relationship

14:06.546 --> 14:08.015
where we bicker all the time.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.784
That is not funny.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.554
It is. It's a little funny.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.024
Listen, all
joking aside,

14:17.057 --> 14:19.326
I promise
we will never put you in a home.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.727
Stop it!

14:20.760 --> 14:23.763
Right. But when your eyes go,
we are taking your car keys.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.299
That's just safety.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.369
Do me a favor. Will you get rid
of this on your way out for me?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.082
Andi. Hey.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.783
I'm so glad you're here.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.552
Yes, I'm sure you are.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.389
Listen, you need to rethink
your separation with Rachel.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.325
There's nothing to rethink.
I know what I want.

14:52.359 --> 14:57.030
Oh, Tom, Tom--
sweet, foolish Tom.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.832
You can't have
what you want.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.534
Why not?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.337
Because... I
love my husband.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.975
Cool. What's that got to do
with me and Miss Lily?

15:08.008 --> 15:11.078
Miss Lily wha-huh?

15:11.111 --> 15:15.415
I was wondering if you could
find out if she's single.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.051
I really like her.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.923
She seems smart.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.965
Yeah, that makes sense.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.492
Kate!
Hi.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.660
Hey.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.030
Oh, you smell great.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.632
Tip of the iceberg.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.400
I brought red.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.701
Hope that's okay.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.204
That sounds fantastic!

16:12.972 --> 16:15.075
What are you doing here?

16:15.108 --> 16:17.210
Well, I came to pick up Molly
for our date,

16:17.244 --> 16:19.079
and Ken graciously invited me
to stay for dinner.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.913
Yeah, I just figured
the more the merrier.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.650
Molly speaks very highly
of Will.
Oh.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.817
Hear that, Mother?

16:24.851 --> 16:28.488
She speaks highly of me.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.224
You are only doing this
to mess with me.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.760
I would never date somebody
to mess with you.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.396
That's just a huge bonus.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.401
All right, come on, birdie.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.436
Get that piggy.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.905
Sweetie?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.907
Sweetie?
Mm-hmm.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.277
Okay.
Oh.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.814
It feels like ever since
you got that phone,

16:54.847 --> 16:56.116
you've had no time for me.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.786
Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Just, shh!

16:59.819 --> 17:02.889
Do you mind if maybe
we just talk?

17:02.922 --> 17:05.658
What?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.094
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.962
Um, absolutely.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.867
It's a FaceTime request.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.269
From you.
Yeah.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.671
Go in the other room
so that we can talk.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.040
Go! Go!

17:24.477 --> 17:28.148
Babe, flip the camera
so I can see what you're seeing.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.183
Can you see this?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.452
Why are you unbuttoning
your shirt?

17:32.485 --> 17:35.322
Because Bobby and Andi
aren't the only ones

17:35.355 --> 17:39.058
who can have fun on film.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.935
Will, that was hysterical.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.803
He's a doctor,
and he's funny.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.273
boyfriend.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.576
Medical humor.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.877
I love it, Ken.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.714
we should all go away
together. This weekend.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.083
I... love... that.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.753
Mother?

18:06.786 --> 18:07.920
Oh...

18:07.954 --> 18:09.489
That is it!

18:09.522 --> 18:10.790
A word, please?

18:10.823 --> 18:13.160
Uh, osteoporosis?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.267
What are you doing out there?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.901
Apparently,
preparing to bang a 23-year-old

18:21.934 --> 18:23.303
with the father's blessing.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.571
Oh, God.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.573
Will you just cut it out
and break up with her?
No.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
No way. I think I could actually
get serious with her.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.278
Well, I think I could actually
get serious with him!

18:31.311 --> 18:33.146
See what you did?
You woke the baby!

18:33.180 --> 18:34.647
Oh, what baby?

18:34.681 --> 18:35.882
Yeah, what baby?

18:39.018 --> 18:42.155
Oh. There's my
little guy.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.291
Don't cry.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.092
Oh.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.894
Who's this?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.362
I was gonna tell you tonight.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.631
This is my son Spencer.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.534
Oh. What a cutie.

18:55.468 --> 18:59.372
That would make you a father.

18:59.406 --> 19:03.276
That would make you
a grandmother.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.246
Excuse me.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.681
Does this window open
to the street?

19:15.355 --> 19:16.956
So, she faked
another seizure?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.492
Uh-huh.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.829
Even bit my hand
so it would seem real.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.766
Hey, Lowell.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.801
Enjoying my
old iPhone?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.470
Yeah, I am!
I know you are.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.441
Because it's still syncing
wirelessly to my iPad.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.176
Oh, no.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.678
What? What-What's
happening?

19:38.711 --> 19:41.814
It means she's seen everything
you've put on your phone.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.784
Everything.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.819
But that means she's seen...

19:46.853 --> 19:50.490
Pretty people having sex.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.825
Seriously?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.862
You guys made a sex tape
after what we just watched?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.900
What did you
just watch?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.870
A video of a...

20:08.741 --> 20:11.578
I can't think of anything!
We saw your sex tape.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.180
You couldn't say "cat"?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.883
Half the Internet
is videos of cats, Will.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.151
You watched our sex tape?!

20:19.185 --> 20:20.753
Not just me. We all did.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.121
Oh.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.590
Wow.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.660
Remind me never
to rob a bank
with you.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.162
Okay. In our defense, you
left it in the armoire.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.532
That's where I put it.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.835
How could you guys do that?!

20:35.868 --> 20:37.537
Listen, if it's any consolation,

20:37.570 --> 20:41.741
your sex tape is way better
than their sex tape.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.745
No, it's not any consolation...

20:45.778 --> 20:48.781
Really?
Really?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.619
Go, younger Bobby.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.623
Take it, younger Andi.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.292
This is kind of
turning me on.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.493
I'm thinking
that maybe we should...

21:00.527 --> 21:01.861
If you're gonna
say anything other

21:01.894 --> 21:05.898
than "have a snack,"
the answer is no.
