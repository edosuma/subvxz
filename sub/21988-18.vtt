WEBVTT

00:09.885 --> 00:11.517
Wow.

00:11.519 --> 00:13.450
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:13.452 --> 00:15.283
I thought this was gonna be
all technical stuff.

00:15.285 --> 00:17.650
I didn't know
Ducky wrestled a python

00:17.652 --> 00:19.685
or met David Bowie.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.085
Yeah, on the same day.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.985
This book is really detailed.

00:22.987 --> 00:24.885
Yeah, and really entertaining.

00:24.887 --> 00:26.419
And really long.

00:26.421 --> 00:28.552
I mean, 311 pages?

00:29.554 --> 00:31.653
I'm never gonna finish this.
Well, that's only

00:31.655 --> 00:32.619
the first five chapters.

00:32.622 --> 00:33.854
There is no pictures.

00:33.856 --> 00:35.287
Well, the publisher doesn't add

00:35.289 --> 00:37.287
visual elements
until after the first proof.

00:37.289 --> 00:38.755
So there will be pictures?

00:38.757 --> 00:41.188
Certainly, Nicholas.
There will be an abundance

00:41.190 --> 00:43.389
of photos, charts, sketches,

00:43.391 --> 00:45.122
and maps. Sweet.

00:45.124 --> 00:47.355
You've already finished?

00:47.357 --> 00:48.822
I couldn't put it down.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.089
You wrestled a python?

00:53.525 --> 00:55.023
I see Jethro

00:55.025 --> 00:56.723
has yet to begin.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.524
I thought perhaps
he might take advantage

00:58.526 --> 01:01.158
of a relatively quiet day.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.358
Always the calm
before the storm.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.325
- Body, Gibbs?
- No.

01:05.327 --> 01:06.759
New case?

01:06.761 --> 01:08.092
- No.
- So the storm

01:08.094 --> 01:09.992
was just a figure of speech?

01:09.994 --> 01:11.226
You think?

01:12.361 --> 01:15.926
It's perfect. You
can, start reading.

01:15.928 --> 01:17.993
Heavy.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.460
Yeah, it's, exercise
for your brain

01:20.462 --> 01:22.027
and biceps.

01:22.029 --> 01:25.495
Yes, II plan to make a few trims

01:25.497 --> 01:27.062
before handing it in tomorrow.

01:27.064 --> 01:28.562
So I'd appreciate

01:28.564 --> 01:30.629
your emailing me
any comments that you have

01:30.631 --> 01:31.829
by the time I get back

01:31.831 --> 01:33.629
to New York. What, tonight?

01:33.631 --> 01:35.829
My assistant Kasie's orders.

01:35.831 --> 01:37.663
Any later,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.131
and she's threatened
to break both my arms.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.297
Eek.

01:42.299 --> 01:44.398
I guess you guys
got some work to do.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.165
You didn't actually read it,
Nick.

01:46.167 --> 01:47.664
So I got no notes.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.136 --> 01:59.733
Boss?

02:55.277 --> 02:57.076
Well, this is a new one.

02:57.078 --> 02:58.842
Yeah, a body on our own roof.

02:58.844 --> 03:00.143
Can't beat the commute.

03:00.145 --> 03:01.276
Tell that to him.

03:01.278 --> 03:03.210
Carl Higby. 35.

03:03.212 --> 03:05.943
Airconditioning repairman.

03:05.945 --> 03:08.644
Dangerous job. Today, at least.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.811
Looks like a transformer blew.

03:10.813 --> 03:13.412
Well, that explains
the power surge

03:13.414 --> 03:16.445
before the body
hit the skylight.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.312
It also explains all
this charred flesh.

03:19.314 --> 03:21.479
Likely the cause of death.

03:21.481 --> 03:23.113
And you all
witnessed it from below,

03:23.115 --> 03:24.614
so you know the time of death.

03:24.616 --> 03:27.781
Which means we might get to
finish Ducky's book, after all.

03:27.783 --> 03:29.881
No, not until we confirm
what happened.

03:29.883 --> 03:32.281
I guess it could have been
faulty equipment.

03:32.283 --> 03:34.681
Our insurance and his employer
will want to know.

03:34.683 --> 03:36.581
So will his family.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.982
All right, I'll call the
company, you take the family.

03:40.018 --> 03:41.283
Hey, yo!

03:41.285 --> 03:43.583
You guys need to see this.

03:48.552 --> 03:50.618
You got something?

03:50.620 --> 03:52.551
Well, it's not about the case.

03:52.553 --> 03:55.485
Check this out.

03:55.487 --> 03:57.252
What is all this? Wh...

03:57.254 --> 03:59.419
It's...

03:59.421 --> 04:02.819
an NCIS secret break room, baby.

04:02.821 --> 04:04.686
No way.

04:04.688 --> 04:07.520
It's so peaceful up here.

04:07.522 --> 04:09.320
And the view.

04:10.156 --> 04:13.188
And you get full bars.

04:13.190 --> 04:15.622
Where else in the world
do you get that?

04:15.624 --> 04:17.387
Do I smell doughnuts?

04:17.390 --> 04:18.588
That must be

04:18.589 --> 04:20.789
from the bakery down the corner.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.156
Is this heaven?

04:22.158 --> 04:24.189
Really?

04:25.158 --> 04:26.389
Okay.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.446
Is that how you guys
are gonna play it?

04:27.470 --> 04:29.425
What?

04:29.426 --> 04:31.490
You didn't know
about this place?

04:32.559 --> 04:34.591
We didn't. Right, McGee?

04:34.592 --> 04:36.124
I've never been up here before.

04:36.126 --> 04:38.158
Then whose chair is this?

04:38.860 --> 04:41.858
Don't look at me. I...

04:43.060 --> 04:44.793
Gibbs.

04:44.795 --> 04:46.326
Chief.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.560
Thanks for taking the time
to see me.

04:47.562 --> 04:48.560
You look great.

04:48.562 --> 04:50.493
Three weeks on a romantic cruise

04:50.495 --> 04:52.094
in the Mediterranean
will do that.

04:52.096 --> 04:54.494
Judith sends her best.

04:54.496 --> 04:56.227
Yeah, I'll bet she does.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.428
And so does Junior.
I saw him in Paris

04:58.430 --> 04:59.895
before the cruise.

04:59.897 --> 05:01.928
And, my granddaughter...

05:01.930 --> 05:04.295
She calls me PopPop. Aw.

05:04.297 --> 05:05.896
- Isn't that great?
- That's great.

05:05.898 --> 05:07.329
We still on for that drink?

05:07.331 --> 05:09.029
We were.

05:09.031 --> 05:11.164
Something came up.

05:12.466 --> 05:15.264
Well, I guess our drinks
will have to wait.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.831
You okay?

05:18.833 --> 05:22.498
Well, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.732
Boss, we got a problem.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.899
Mr. D. How's it going?

05:26.901 --> 05:28.399
Funny you ask.

05:28.401 --> 05:30.533
I was just talking to the...
McGee, what do you got?

05:30.535 --> 05:31.900
I tried calling the HVAC company

05:31.902 --> 05:33.200
to let them know what happened.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.467
I'll go find Jimmy.

05:34.469 --> 05:36.200
Rain check, Gibbs? You got it.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.934
Thanks. What'd they say?

05:37.936 --> 05:40.134
Well, I didn't get through
'cause it turns out

05:40.136 --> 05:43.401
the District HVAC Service
doesn't exist.

05:44.237 --> 05:46.702
What?

05:49.905 --> 05:53.203
Then who the hell's on our roof?

05:55.705 --> 05:58.271
Hey. Not only
is the company fake,

05:58.273 --> 05:59.870
so is our dead guy's I.D.;

05:59.872 --> 06:01.371
Carl Higby is an alias.

06:01.373 --> 06:03.038
I'm running the fingerprints

06:03.040 --> 06:04.005
through AFIS,

06:04.007 --> 06:05.971
but this gets worse.
Like, way worse.

06:05.973 --> 06:08.605
- How?
- Jimmy confirmed that the cause of death

06:08.607 --> 06:11.273
was from a concussive force
from an explosion.

06:11.275 --> 06:13.406
Right, the AC transformer. No.

06:13.408 --> 06:15.373
The transformer boom was caused

06:15.375 --> 06:16.540
by a prior boom.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.706
Boom, boom?

06:17.708 --> 06:19.174
Yeah.

06:19.176 --> 06:21.441
So, Jimmy found steel fragments

06:21.443 --> 06:22.808
in the body,

06:22.810 --> 06:24.508
and good ol' Major Mass Spec
found traces

06:24.510 --> 06:26.875
of potassium nitrate
on the victim's clothing.

06:26.877 --> 06:27.842
Not to mention,

06:27.844 --> 06:30.875
this was in his
burned up toolbox.

06:30.877 --> 06:32.509
This looks like a detonator.

06:32.511 --> 06:33.743
Because it was.

06:33.745 --> 06:35.943
There was a bomb in his toolbox?

06:36.546 --> 06:37.876
With faulty wiring,

06:37.878 --> 06:39.844
which caused
the first explosion.

06:39.846 --> 06:42.445
And then that caused
the transformer to blow.

06:42.447 --> 06:45.845
So our intruder
accidentally killed himself...

06:45.847 --> 06:46.812
With a pipe bomb.

06:46.814 --> 06:50.045
On the roof
of NCIS headquarters.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.655
Whoa.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.023
Jack, where's the fire?

07:07.025 --> 07:08.456
Funny, but not far off.

07:08.458 --> 07:09.889
Phony repairman blew himself up

07:09.891 --> 07:11.356
with a pipe bomb. Where?

07:11.358 --> 07:12.657
On the roof.

07:12.659 --> 07:14.623
Temporary evacuation
till the bomb squad

07:14.625 --> 07:16.691
can get here for a sweep.
The REACT team's involved?

07:16.693 --> 07:18.291
Is that for anyone
in particular?

07:18.293 --> 07:20.225
Not anymore. Help yourself.
Thank you.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.492
Let me get that for you, Cindi.

07:23.494 --> 07:25.225
Sloane, I'll meet
you downstairs.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.459
Yeah, right behind you.

07:34.462 --> 07:36.661
All right, let me know when
you have more, Sergeant.

07:36.663 --> 07:38.327
Thank you.

07:38.329 --> 07:40.761
District HVAC Service

07:40.763 --> 07:42.795
was on the list
of approved contractors.

07:42.797 --> 07:45.428
- Somebody put 'em there.
- Front gate's pulling records now.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.929
But our repairman, he passed
their visual inspection.

07:47.931 --> 07:48.929
Dogs, too.

07:48.931 --> 07:50.896
That explosive
was very well hidden.

07:50.898 --> 07:52.930
This...

07:52.932 --> 07:54.530
this could have been bad, Gibbs.

07:54.532 --> 07:55.730
It still might be.

07:55.732 --> 07:57.497
Which is why I'm
evacuating the building.

07:57.499 --> 08:00.031
REACT team's got a tent
in the motor pool.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.531
Until we can I.D. the body
and its intended target,

08:02.533 --> 08:04.231
your team
should regroup outside.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.565
What about you?
I'll be running point

08:05.567 --> 08:06.566
from MTAC.

08:06.568 --> 08:08.065
You stay, I stay.

08:08.901 --> 08:10.532
I'm touched.

08:10.534 --> 08:12.199
The case is in here, Leon.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.533
This is our house.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.099
And I'm trying to protect it

08:15.101 --> 08:17.134
and the people inside. So am I.

08:18.936 --> 08:21.868
You got 30 minutes to finish
any work inside the building.

08:21.870 --> 08:23.701
Then I want you
and your team out. Understood?

08:23.703 --> 08:25.701
Go, Torres.

08:25.703 --> 08:27.068
Top floor. Yeah, on my way.

08:27.070 --> 08:29.235
You didn't answer me.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.570
Hey, Abby,
can you take this down

08:33.572 --> 08:35.202
to the evidence garage for me?

08:35.203 --> 08:36.570
Hey.

08:36.572 --> 08:38.337
Where's Abby?

08:38.339 --> 08:39.703
Per new protocol,

08:39.706 --> 08:41.304
“In the event
of a precautionary evacuation,

08:41.306 --> 08:43.337
“all evidence must be stored
in the evidence garage

08:43.339 --> 08:44.837
prior to evacuation.”

08:44.839 --> 08:46.738
Can you believe it?

08:46.740 --> 08:48.171
Well, actually...
I mean, I guess I can see

08:48.173 --> 08:49.805
how, like, some lawyer
could use the confusion

08:49.807 --> 08:51.205
of an evacuation

08:51.207 --> 08:53.139
to call into question
this chain of evidence,

08:53.141 --> 08:56.639
but both autopsy and Abby's lab
have secure storage.

08:56.641 --> 08:58.006
These new rules

08:58.008 --> 09:00.273
clearly are written by some
outoftouch bean counter.

09:00.275 --> 09:02.174
I helped write that
protocol when I was at NSA.

09:02.176 --> 09:05.041
You used the word “evacuation”
and “evidence”

09:05.043 --> 09:06.207
twice in the same sentence.

09:06.209 --> 09:07.374
Is everything okay, Jimmy?

09:07.376 --> 09:09.008
Senior told me

09:09.010 --> 09:10.342
he's quitting
the Sherlock Consortium

09:10.344 --> 09:11.475
for Investigation. What?

09:11.477 --> 09:13.742
II fought so hard to get him in.

09:13.744 --> 09:15.976
And Senior was on cloud nine.
He and Judith are in love,

09:15.978 --> 09:18.876
and the Sherlocks
were like his quirky new family.

09:18.878 --> 09:20.343
I mean, what happened?

09:21.345 --> 09:23.110
Hold that thought.

09:24.845 --> 09:27.678
Dead guy's fingerprints
just came back.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.612
And he has a criminal record.

09:39.048 --> 09:41.113
Hey!

09:41.115 --> 09:42.746
Senior. What are you doing here?

09:42.748 --> 09:45.147
You are a sight for sore eyes.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.714
Aw. Where is, Jimmy?

09:47.716 --> 09:49.248
He went to ask you for a favor.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.515
To take the evidence
down to the garage?

09:51.517 --> 09:52.882
He said he had too much to do

09:52.884 --> 09:54.682
before Vance kicks us out
of the building.

09:54.684 --> 09:56.215
How did you know?

09:56.217 --> 09:58.683
Because I was about to ask him
for the same favor.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.416
Yeah. Jimmy has one.

10:00.418 --> 10:01.649
That looks just like that.

10:01.651 --> 10:03.550
That's the official
membership card

10:03.552 --> 10:05.550
for the Sherlock Consortium.

10:06.385 --> 10:08.151
I'm turning mine in.

10:08.153 --> 10:09.951
You're quitting already?
Is everything okay?

10:09.953 --> 10:11.718
Well, it's a long story.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.885
And, see,
I was on this cruise...

10:13.887 --> 10:15.552
You know what,
maybe we should just wait.

10:15.554 --> 10:16.819
Um, looks like.

10:16.821 --> 10:18.085
Jimmy's even more behind
than I am.

10:18.087 --> 10:19.485
The body isn't even put away.

10:19.487 --> 10:22.286
We should help him.
Move the body?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.119
Yeah, it's already processed.

10:24.121 --> 10:26.154
Here, put this on.
Wouldn't want to ruin

10:26.156 --> 10:28.820
a nice cashmere sweater
with some fluids.

10:28.822 --> 10:31.087
Fluids?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.055
How'd our dead guy
get on the roof?

10:33.057 --> 10:35.522
A utility ladder outside.

10:35.524 --> 10:37.522
Lock was cut.

10:37.524 --> 10:40.356
No one questions a repairman
climbing on the roof.

10:40.358 --> 10:42.623
Avoided the metal detectors
downstairs.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.123
Yep, and check this out.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.257
It was open when I found it.

10:50.259 --> 10:53.924
Gibbs, somebody's
been in our building.

11:07.629 --> 11:10.260
Somebody's coveralls.

11:10.262 --> 11:12.294
Our dead guy's not alone.

11:18.863 --> 11:20.995
What the hell
was inside of that?

11:20.997 --> 11:22.596
This isn't over.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.363
I think it's time for us to go
downstairs and get our weapons.

11:33.299 --> 11:35.397
Carl the repairman is actually

11:35.399 --> 11:37.965
Eric Barnhardt
of Baltimore, Maryland,

11:37.967 --> 11:41.532
and he has got a drug
record a mile long.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.498
Explains the track marks
I found on his arm.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.566
Yeah, well, drug using
and drug selling,

11:45.568 --> 11:48.266
but this guy's never
come close to terrorism.

11:51.436 --> 11:53.767
Part of your redundant protocol?

11:53.769 --> 11:55.567
No...

12:03.137 --> 12:04.935
It's locked.

12:04.937 --> 12:06.569
Update. Go.

12:06.571 --> 12:08.736
Front gate just confirmed
there were three names

12:08.738 --> 12:10.869
approved for
District HVAC Service.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.537
Three? Where are the other two?

12:12.539 --> 12:14.270
We're pulling security footage
on them now.

12:14.272 --> 12:15.604
All right, put it up.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.372
I'm sorry.

12:25.374 --> 12:27.639
The system doesn't seem
to be responding.

12:33.042 --> 12:34.406
Agent McGee?

12:35.742 --> 12:37.674
System appears
to be in lockdown.

12:37.676 --> 12:38.708
We can't control it.

12:38.710 --> 12:40.041
Well, then we need
to go someplace

12:40.043 --> 12:42.508
where we can.
Come on, everybody out.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.142
Power outage?

12:52.144 --> 12:54.143
We should find Gibbs. Right.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.577
Please,

13:00.579 --> 13:02.011
stay where you are.

13:03.346 --> 13:04.678
Who are you?

13:09.147 --> 13:11.079
The guy in charge.

13:23.057 --> 13:26.856
Someone must've hacked into our
security grid and locked us out.

13:26.858 --> 13:28.557
Which can only happen
from inside the building.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.123
- One of our three repairmen.
- Whatever happened on the roof

13:31.125 --> 13:33.624
is still happening.
Hey, is anyone out there?

13:33.626 --> 13:34.724
Other parts of the building?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.124
Everything from the front doors

13:36.126 --> 13:37.391
to the lab is locked down.

13:37.393 --> 13:39.792
The main lighting system
and the elevators are off,

13:39.794 --> 13:42.592
but, like MTAC, backup power
keeps a few things working.

13:42.594 --> 13:44.626
What about the computer network?
Off.

13:44.628 --> 13:45.993
No cameras. No Internet.

13:45.995 --> 13:48.593
And the buildingwide cell phone
jammers were activated.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.060
They were installed after
the Navy Yard bombing.

13:51.062 --> 13:52.161
To prevent using

13:52.163 --> 13:54.027
cell phones as detonators.
Smart, right?

13:54.029 --> 13:56.394
But now we can't call out
and we can't get out.

13:56.396 --> 13:59.295
Until the system is back online.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.562
Right.

14:03.931 --> 14:05.363
- Give me a count on that.
- Eight.

14:05.365 --> 14:06.662
Sounds good. And you, too?
Yes, ma'am.

14:06.664 --> 14:07.763
One, two, right?
Yeah, sounds good.

14:07.765 --> 14:08.930
Hey. Yeah?

14:08.932 --> 14:10.329
Has Agent Sloane checked in?

14:10.331 --> 14:11.563
No.

14:11.565 --> 14:13.164
Well, what about Gibbs?
He's still inside.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.264
Why?

14:14.266 --> 14:16.130
Who are you again?

14:17.167 --> 14:18.898
Reeves. MI6.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.665
Special Agent Joanna Wright.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.932
Agent Gibbs and his team
got clearance

14:23.934 --> 14:26.599
from Director Vance
to continue the investigation.

14:26.601 --> 14:28.332
Well, I just ran
into Torres on the way out,

14:28.334 --> 14:30.599
and he never said
a word. Wanker.

14:30.601 --> 14:33.933
Don't bother. Cell jammers were
activated inside the building.

14:33.935 --> 14:36.001
- Since when?
- Just now.

14:36.003 --> 14:37.334
Well, did they say why?

14:37.336 --> 14:39.268
It's standard procedure
during bomb sweeps.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.201
I'm going in
to find Gibbs, all right?

14:41.203 --> 14:42.268
No, you're not.

14:42.270 --> 14:43.735
Tell me you're joking.

14:43.737 --> 14:45.436
While I do have
a charming sense of humor,

14:45.438 --> 14:48.069
I never joke when it comes to
the safety of our people.

14:48.071 --> 14:51.203
Until my orders change, no one
gets back in that building.

14:56.806 --> 14:58.171
Is he a friend of yours?

14:59.473 --> 15:01.304
Brother.

15:01.306 --> 15:02.504
Take him and go.

15:02.506 --> 15:05.105
He's not going anywhere.

15:05.107 --> 15:08.206
But one of you
are coming with me.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.605
No. We're not going
anywhere with you.

15:10.607 --> 15:12.373
I'm the one you want.

15:14.442 --> 15:17.274
Let the girl go.
She's just an intern.

15:17.276 --> 15:19.040
She doesn't the know
the difference between

15:19.042 --> 15:20.808
a scalpel and a butter knife.

15:20.810 --> 15:23.741
Excuse me.
Look at the way she dresses.

15:24.810 --> 15:26.875
I'm the medical examiner here.

15:26.877 --> 15:29.443
I've been here for 30 years.

15:29.445 --> 15:31.676
Anything you need, I can get.

15:31.678 --> 15:32.843
And you are?

15:32.845 --> 15:35.576
I'm, Dr. Donald Mallard.

15:41.013 --> 15:43.511
All right, old man.
You got the job.

15:43.513 --> 15:44.678
Let the girl go.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.344
She won't be any trouble.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.812
You're right about that.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.179
She won't.

15:52.915 --> 15:55.679
That wasn't part of the deal.

15:55.681 --> 15:58.747
Dr. Mallard, time is precious.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.017
There's one of our
missing repairmen.

16:20.019 --> 16:21.417
Armed.

16:24.453 --> 16:28.118
My SIG is locked
in my desk. Yours?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.552
Yeah.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.453
I got an idea.
I'll be right back.

16:33.455 --> 16:34.885
Torres.

16:34.887 --> 16:36.619
I can get to my desk, Gibbs.

16:36.621 --> 16:37.753
Stop.

16:37.755 --> 16:41.187
Trust me. I'll be back.

16:48.089 --> 16:49.221
Is breaking out
really necessary?

16:49.223 --> 16:51.022
I mean, the network
could just come back on.

16:51.024 --> 16:52.488
Dead guy on the roof,

16:52.490 --> 16:53.888
pipe bomb, and now
we're trapped.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.956
Do you really just want
to sit here and wait?

16:55.958 --> 16:58.323
When you put it that way,
kind of.

16:58.325 --> 16:59.823
Something is wrong and we have
to get out there and help.

16:59.825 --> 17:00.989
It's... It's just a matter

17:00.991 --> 17:02.757
of finding the right wires.

17:02.759 --> 17:05.324
I've been reading more
about our dead guy.

17:05.326 --> 17:07.391
While he doesn't
have any priors for

17:07.393 --> 17:09.391
attacking government
buildings...

17:10.792 --> 17:14.125
that name, Adrian Fincher,
it does ring a bell.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.724
It should, because he's
a drug kingpin in Baltimore.

17:16.727 --> 17:18.460
Says here our victim
used to work for him.

17:18.462 --> 17:21.560
Wait.

17:21.561 --> 17:25.827
NCIS just took over a case
from the DEA in Baltimore.

17:25.829 --> 17:28.093
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

17:28.095 --> 17:31.094
This thing just got
a whole lot bigger,

17:31.096 --> 17:32.961
which means we really
have to get out there

17:32.963 --> 17:34.662
and tell someone,

17:34.664 --> 17:36.728
so please help me.

17:38.398 --> 17:41.129
Let's see, um, okay.
Yellow and blue

17:41.131 --> 17:43.096
make green, green means go.

17:43.098 --> 17:46.197
I just went left to right,
but that works, too.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.697
Okay, wish me luck.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.164
Three, two, one.

17:50.366 --> 17:53.364
Whoa. That is not good.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.065
No. Major Mass Spec.

17:59.067 --> 18:02.399
That's even worse.

18:02.401 --> 18:03.833
All right.

18:03.835 --> 18:07.200
I am... patched in.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.834
- To the system?
- Well, no.

18:09.836 --> 18:10.900
But I had another idea.

18:10.902 --> 18:12.201
I hope it's a good one.

18:12.203 --> 18:13.301
Here's how I see it:

18:13.303 --> 18:14.668
The bad guys enter

18:14.670 --> 18:16.568
a secure government building
to plant a bomb.

18:16.570 --> 18:17.968
But it blows up prematurely.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.101
So with a fullscale
investigation going on,

18:20.103 --> 18:21.902
why stick around
and lock down the system?

18:21.904 --> 18:24.570
Big risk.
Unless there's still a plan to execute.

18:24.572 --> 18:26.803
Which means they must have
a way to talk to each other.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.337
Now, if we rule out
cellular frequencies

18:28.339 --> 18:30.970
or Internet, we're left with...
Twoway radios.

18:30.972 --> 18:33.304
Right. Now, I got a manual
scanner right here.

18:33.306 --> 18:35.637
We can't radio out...
But we can listen in.

18:35.639 --> 18:38.638
Maybe put a timeline on getting
the hell out of this place.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.039
Well, that's if they're talking
to each other,

18:40.041 --> 18:42.339
and if I can find
the frequency they're using.

18:42.341 --> 18:43.406
Do it, McGee.

18:43.408 --> 18:45.005
Right.

18:49.908 --> 18:51.373
We're gonna get out of here.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.107
I don't like cages.

19:01.844 --> 19:04.275
Where the hell are you?

19:20.380 --> 19:22.178
Hey.

19:24.981 --> 19:26.046
Hey!

19:28.415 --> 19:30.847
Man, turn off the music!

19:30.849 --> 19:33.013
All right, all right,
all right. You got me.

19:33.015 --> 19:36.614
I skipped that stupid
evacuation drill.

19:36.616 --> 19:38.514
Go ahead. Go ahead. Write me up.

19:38.516 --> 19:40.448
I don't care. Some of
us got a job to do

19:40.450 --> 19:43.281
and not all of us
get paid overtime.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.682
Besides, I'm trying
to get home to the wife early.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.416
You know, the kids
are at a sleepover,

19:47.418 --> 19:48.982
because, you know,
I'm trying to get

19:48.984 --> 19:51.116
that badabing, badaboom,
you know what I'm saying?

19:51.118 --> 19:52.350
Shut up and listen
to what I say.

19:52.352 --> 19:54.050
You agents...
Theythey give you a badge

19:54.052 --> 19:55.617
and you think you're that cool.

19:55.619 --> 19:57.362
And all of a sudden,
you're better than everybody.

19:57.386 --> 19:58.185
Hey!

19:58.186 --> 19:59.984
I don't have a badge!

19:59.986 --> 20:02.384
And this is not a drill!

20:03.253 --> 20:06.118
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're not NCIS?

20:06.120 --> 20:07.452
Yeah, and you're not that smart.
Put your hands on your head.

20:07.454 --> 20:08.986
Okay. Okay, okay. Now!

20:08.988 --> 20:10.752
Why are you yelling?

20:10.754 --> 20:13.086
Hold right here, Dr. Mallard.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.854
Found the janitor
wandering around.

20:15.856 --> 20:17.787
Idiot wouldn't stop talking.

20:18.989 --> 20:20.254
Move.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.722
What's so funny?

20:29.557 --> 20:32.323
You. You're the idiot.

20:32.325 --> 20:34.389
He's not a janitor,
he's an agent.

20:34.391 --> 20:36.423
This is his desk.

20:44.527 --> 20:46.892
Looking for this?

20:46.894 --> 20:47.925
Yeah.

20:47.927 --> 20:49.658
Yeah.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.426
Cuff him.

20:51.428 --> 20:54.060
Come on.

20:55.495 --> 20:57.160
Palms out.

20:57.162 --> 20:58.727
Don't try anything.

20:58.729 --> 21:00.894
I'm taking them both with me.
Avoid any more problems.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.361
Move.

21:05.563 --> 21:06.661
Burke.

21:06.663 --> 21:07.761
What the hell's wrong with you?

21:07.763 --> 21:09.262
No names.

21:09.264 --> 21:11.095
Don't you think you've
had enough of that?

21:11.097 --> 21:12.529
Back off.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.330
I'm not your brother.

21:15.332 --> 21:17.363
I'm just here to make sure
you guys get the job done.

21:17.365 --> 21:19.445
Which means I'm the one
who takes them to the garage.

21:21.299 --> 21:23.197
If you and your boss
want this job done,

21:23.199 --> 21:25.399
you stay the hell out of my way.
Do you understand that?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.465
Elevator, now. Move it.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.233
It's Burke, right?

21:34.235 --> 21:35.665
Of course it's Burke.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.700
Well, joke's on you, buddy.

21:37.702 --> 21:39.067
The elevator is off.

21:40.702 --> 21:43.033
Won't be for long.

21:50.670 --> 21:51.802
Director, I'm sorry.

21:51.804 --> 21:53.435
I thought this was worth a shot.

21:54.537 --> 21:56.002
Elevators, now.

21:56.004 --> 21:57.269
Wait.

21:57.271 --> 21:58.736
Who is that?

21:58.738 --> 21:59.936
Do you copy?

21:59.938 --> 22:01.103
Turn on the elevators.

22:01.105 --> 22:02.704
We're on our way down.

22:02.706 --> 22:04.103
Down where?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.271
Who's he talking to?

22:08.340 --> 22:10.605
Thank you.

22:10.607 --> 22:14.072
In the elevator, face the wall,
don't turn around.

22:14.074 --> 22:15.472
And you,

22:15.474 --> 22:18.439
make sure Agent Janitor
was alone.

22:19.908 --> 22:23.573
And check the drawers for guns.

22:29.176 --> 22:30.908
Well, somebody's
controlling the system.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.308
Which means
they're in the system.

22:33.877 --> 22:35.408
They're logged in right now.

22:35.410 --> 22:37.076
I can see the root directory,

22:37.078 --> 22:38.542
but I still can't change it.

22:41.844 --> 22:43.309
We don't have to...
All we need to know

22:43.311 --> 22:45.010
is where the last
command came from.

22:45.012 --> 22:46.544
It's got to be a terminal
in this building.

22:46.546 --> 22:48.544
Do you mind if I try?

22:48.546 --> 22:50.744
I'm doing everything I can, sir.

22:50.746 --> 22:51.811
This is my job.

22:51.813 --> 22:53.545
And Agent McGee
is only doing his.

22:56.614 --> 22:58.279
Thank you.

22:59.448 --> 23:02.379
The hacker was in
the power grid.

23:04.381 --> 23:06.013
All right, there.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.247
There's the line of code
that turned on the elevators.

23:08.249 --> 23:11.547
It's terminal 661,
is where the command came from.

23:11.549 --> 23:14.748
66... Where is that?

23:16.084 --> 23:17.148
Agent McGee?

23:20.518 --> 23:21.518
Gun!

23:27.685 --> 23:29.950
Here.

23:30.919 --> 23:32.618
We have a mole problem.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.251
HR is gonna have a field day.

23:41.745 --> 23:44.234
It's been ten minutes
since we lost cell service.

23:44.235 --> 23:45.394
Any word from Vance?

23:45.395 --> 23:48.960
No. Which, I'll grant you, has
me on the verge of concerned.

23:48.962 --> 23:51.093
Well, then, this should
put you over the edge.

23:51.095 --> 23:52.627
I've been reviewing
the security records.

23:52.629 --> 23:53.994
Not only did a phony
repair company

23:53.996 --> 23:55.828
make its way onto the Navy Yard,

23:55.830 --> 23:57.894
there were three names
on the clearance list.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.495
Including the
dead guy on the roof?

23:59.497 --> 24:01.361
Yeah. So where
are the other two?

24:01.363 --> 24:03.029
Doesn't mean they're inside.

24:03.031 --> 24:04.596
Visual inspection complete.

24:04.598 --> 24:06.162
Ma'am, building entrance appears

24:06.164 --> 24:07.629
to be locked down
from the inside.

24:07.631 --> 24:09.663
You sent a team to
check those doors?

24:09.665 --> 24:11.230
You do think something's up.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.197
Roger that.
Have your team fall back, over.

24:13.199 --> 24:14.397
Fall back?

24:14.399 --> 24:15.730
We need to be running in there.

24:15.732 --> 24:17.198
With Sherman tanks.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.865
Bomb squad's ten minutes out.

24:18.867 --> 24:19.998
Meanwhile,
my friends are in there,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.364
dealing with God knows what.

24:21.366 --> 24:22.698
Even if that was the case,

24:22.700 --> 24:24.165
busting in without
knowing the play

24:24.167 --> 24:25.799
would put them
in even more danger.

24:26.668 --> 24:28.033
If there's a problem,

24:28.035 --> 24:30.033
the agents inside will tell us.

24:35.569 --> 24:36.834
Hey, I'm sorry, Nick.

24:36.836 --> 24:39.534
Everything got messed up.

24:39.536 --> 24:41.268
I was just trying
to protect Abby.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.368
I had no idea that she'd...

24:43.370 --> 24:45.068
Quiet.

24:45.070 --> 24:47.969
You're quite the chatterbox,
aren't you, Dr. Mallard?

24:47.971 --> 24:50.102
You, inside.

24:50.104 --> 24:52.636
Inside, now.

24:56.105 --> 24:58.304
To the right.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.938
Sit.

25:00.940 --> 25:02.938
It's time for you
to earn your keep.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.271
I need all evidence box numbers

25:04.273 --> 25:05.905
pertaining to an Adrian Fincher.

25:05.907 --> 25:07.638
The drug lord?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.805
You guys are
either good friends,

25:08.807 --> 25:11.239
or you owe him a lot of money.

25:11.241 --> 25:13.040
Or maybe your brother did.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.440
If you're trying
to get a rise out of me,

25:14.442 --> 25:15.707
I don't get upset that easy.

25:15.709 --> 25:16.841
No.

25:16.843 --> 25:18.607
Not an Army man like you.

25:22.243 --> 25:24.042
That was a long time ago.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.175
Loyalties change.

25:25.177 --> 25:26.508
Not mine.

25:26.510 --> 25:28.542
So you'll understand
when I say...

25:29.110 --> 25:30.709
suck it.

25:30.711 --> 25:33.009
Maybe we ought to just...

25:33.011 --> 25:34.677
Come on, man!

25:34.679 --> 25:36.910
You were talking about loyalty?

25:38.712 --> 25:39.844
Please, go on.

25:41.379 --> 25:45.078
All right, all right, all right.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.878
You win.

25:52.014 --> 25:53.646
So...

25:54.748 --> 25:57.080
I think we need
to change our approach.

25:57.082 --> 25:59.013
I think we need
to change our names.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.314
Your hotwiring has
destroyed Abby's lab.

26:01.316 --> 26:05.647
We highlighted dangerous flaws
in the backup power system.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.315
Look, we have to get out
of here, and I don't really

26:07.317 --> 26:08.782
hear you coming up
with any solution.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.182
WWe'll figure out something.

26:10.184 --> 26:12.449
When God closes a door,
he opens a window.

26:12.451 --> 26:14.182
Yes. The windows.

26:14.184 --> 26:16.016
No, forget it.
Not even God can open those.

26:16.018 --> 26:17.516
That is three inches
of hermeticallysealed

26:17.518 --> 26:18.649
bulletproof glass.

26:18.651 --> 26:19.950
Really? Yeah.

26:19.952 --> 26:21.550
Changes were made
after the sniper.

26:21.552 --> 26:23.383
What? What sniper?
Doesn't matter.

26:23.385 --> 26:26.084
The only thing that opens
that window is a pipe bomb.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.551
We are not building a pipe bomb.

26:30.553 --> 26:33.419
But we have the chemicals.

26:40.489 --> 26:42.367
Turn on the garage computer.

26:44.623 --> 26:46.020
Wait, you're still
in the garage?

26:46.022 --> 26:48.287
What is going on down there?

26:48.289 --> 26:49.521
Let me go.

26:49.523 --> 26:51.455
Turn on the damn computer.

26:51.457 --> 26:52.689
Where are you?

26:52.691 --> 26:54.555
Hard to find
good help these days.

26:54.557 --> 26:56.722
Everybody's learning
the hard way.

26:56.724 --> 27:00.790
She's been listening in on their
radio frequency the entire time.

27:02.725 --> 27:06.057
“NCIS Technician Leslie Vyas.”

27:06.059 --> 27:07.557
You've been here six years.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.924
Why risk it all?

27:11.460 --> 27:13.558
Director,
we've got a big problem.

27:15.361 --> 27:17.392
There's a timed lockout
on her workstation.

27:17.394 --> 27:19.993
I can't get in
without a password.

27:24.629 --> 27:27.627
Thank you for following orders.

27:28.762 --> 27:30.127
Unlike your boy on the radio.

27:30.129 --> 27:32.061
Gonna have to find the
evidence on your own.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.262
You're here to destroy it.

27:34.264 --> 27:36.229
That pipe bomb

27:36.231 --> 27:37.662
on the roof had me...

27:37.664 --> 27:39.262
had me really confused.

27:39.264 --> 27:41.263
But then I looked up.

27:42.432 --> 27:43.797
Plan A was to...

27:43.799 --> 27:46.396
just drop it in and walk away.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.597
Until your brother, well...

27:50.299 --> 27:52.664
blew himself up.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.798
That was embarrassing.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.799
Plan B was to have us
help you steal it. And...

27:59.267 --> 28:01.199
what's Plan C, Burke?

28:01.201 --> 28:03.566
You're gonna love it.

28:11.669 --> 28:12.634
Here, have a seat.

28:12.636 --> 28:14.502
Thanks.

28:14.504 --> 28:15.535
How you holding up?

28:15.537 --> 28:17.335
It's been a rough week.

28:17.337 --> 28:20.102
Well, it's about to get worse
if we don't get out of here.

28:20.104 --> 28:22.836
I know this isn't exactly
the best time, but,

28:22.838 --> 28:25.870
I've been dying to tell someone.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.403
Okay, that's a very poor choice
of words.

28:28.405 --> 28:31.837
Judith dumped me.

28:32.706 --> 28:34.771
What?

28:37.273 --> 28:40.138
Come on, you son of a...

28:45.708 --> 28:47.273
Who's there?

29:01.077 --> 29:04.076
Judith was a special lady.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.510
I loved her.

29:09.645 --> 29:11.043
Even after I found out

29:11.045 --> 29:13.444
that she was going
with a much younger man.

29:13.446 --> 29:15.677
The cruise director,

29:15.679 --> 29:18.278
Cristos.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.445
They were going below deck.

29:20.447 --> 29:23.578
Yeah, that'sthat's rough.

29:26.914 --> 29:29.713
You know, rejection, sucks.

29:31.182 --> 29:32.380
Well, I've been told.

29:32.382 --> 29:34.380
What?

29:34.382 --> 29:35.547
You've never been dumped?

29:35.549 --> 29:36.881
I know, right?

29:36.883 --> 29:38.414
It's a gift.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.215
What about Eleanor?

29:47.217 --> 29:49.549
What? Bishop?

29:49.551 --> 29:51.617
No, we've never...

29:51.619 --> 29:52.850
Wait, did you hear something?

29:52.852 --> 29:55.050
Did she say something?

29:55.052 --> 29:59.217
How do you like Plan C?

29:59.219 --> 30:01.851
Well, I don't like it.

30:01.853 --> 30:05.051
Look, Burke, destroying evidence
is one thing, but...

30:05.053 --> 30:07.519
murder is another one.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.121
Sweet dreams.

30:56.495 --> 30:58.426
Damn it, show yourself!

31:06.364 --> 31:07.462
Come on!

31:07.464 --> 31:08.861
Where are you?!

31:19.465 --> 31:21.830
Special Agent Gibbs
requesting a 999.

31:21.832 --> 31:23.097
Over.

31:23.099 --> 31:25.231
Copy that, Gibbs.

31:25.233 --> 31:27.498
REACT team is mobilizing.

31:31.901 --> 31:34.266
Don't bother. Turn around.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.666
What is your sitrep,
Gibbs? Over.

31:37.935 --> 31:38.866
It's Gibbs, isn't it?

31:38.868 --> 31:40.667
We're coming in.

31:40.669 --> 31:43.667
I was done here, but you've gone
and complicated my exit.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.034
Gibbs, come in. Where are you?

31:46.036 --> 31:47.601
Now you're gonna fix it.

31:56.589 --> 31:59.754
We can't get NCIS back online
without your password.

31:59.756 --> 32:00.988
I know.

32:00.990 --> 32:03.388
I guess we can
rule out coercion.

32:03.390 --> 32:06.589
This isn't the attitude
of someone who's acting

32:06.591 --> 32:08.156
under duress. It's over, Leslie.

32:08.158 --> 32:10.290
Why don't you help yourself out
and talk to us?

32:10.292 --> 32:11.390
You can't keep this up.

32:11.392 --> 32:13.190
Resolve isn't her problem.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.490
Is it, Leslie?

32:14.492 --> 32:17.924
You have a beef with NCIS
or just with life in general?

32:18.926 --> 32:20.591
Nice.

32:20.593 --> 32:23.425
Just undergraduate
or master's, too?

32:23.427 --> 32:25.125
You don't know anything
about me.

32:25.127 --> 32:27.726
You didn't even know my name
until you read it on my badge.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.993
Did you? I got it.

32:29.995 --> 32:32.627
Disgruntled employee.

32:32.629 --> 32:34.126
Am I right?

32:34.128 --> 32:36.327
Poor you. Clearly,

32:36.329 --> 32:38.728
we didn't give you
what you were looking for.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.895
Attention? Money?

32:40.897 --> 32:42.461
Money!

32:42.463 --> 32:46.629
Sitting for six years
at the same government computer

32:46.631 --> 32:48.862
earning
the same government paycheck.

32:48.864 --> 32:50.829
So when somebody knocks

32:50.831 --> 32:53.129
on your door
and offers you 20 grand

32:53.131 --> 32:55.630
to put a name on
a list, you jump!

32:55.632 --> 32:57.664
Am I close?

32:58.833 --> 33:01.231
It was $75,000.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.764
And they found me online.

33:03.766 --> 33:05.265
Genius.

33:05.267 --> 33:06.598
What did you say? OOkay.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.166
All right. Okay.

33:08.168 --> 33:09.732
Why are they here?

33:09.734 --> 33:11.132
Nobody was gonna get hurt.

33:11.134 --> 33:12.633
What about the pipe bomb?

33:12.635 --> 33:13.833
I didn't know about that.

33:13.835 --> 33:15.267
And the gun in your boot?

33:15.269 --> 33:17.467
Password.

33:18.269 --> 33:19.500
There isn't one.

33:19.502 --> 33:21.734
Please tell me you didn't.

33:21.736 --> 33:24.468
You locked out the
entire system without

33:24.470 --> 33:25.768
a backdoor?

33:27.071 --> 33:30.536
Doesn't a pipe bomb
need a, you know, pipe?

33:30.538 --> 33:32.836
We just need to break
the window.

33:33.704 --> 33:36.869
You're good at this.

33:36.871 --> 33:39.804
It's just basic physics.

33:39.806 --> 33:43.671
Mixed with a little
middle school rebellion.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.905
I just hope we're not too late.

33:45.907 --> 33:48.472
TAC, Alpha Team
entering first floor.

34:12.078 --> 34:13.975
I told you
to get me out of here.

34:13.976 --> 34:15.009
Where are we going?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.076
Up.

34:17.078 --> 34:19.277
The same way I came in? No.

34:19.279 --> 34:22.010
That's all there is.

34:22.913 --> 34:25.610
You can check for yourself
on channel two.

34:29.213 --> 34:31.445
Copy that. East wing clear.

34:31.447 --> 34:33.446
Ground floor sweep in progress.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.946
Alpha Team moving to squad room.

34:35.947 --> 34:39.913
Or you can shoot me
and just be done.

34:39.915 --> 34:42.246
You're my insurance policy.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.346
I don't think so.

34:43.348 --> 34:44.612
Start climbing.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.780
Move it.

34:50.150 --> 34:51.748
What are you doing?

34:51.750 --> 34:52.981
I'm looking for something to

34:52.983 --> 34:54.415
get us out of these handcuffs...

34:54.417 --> 34:56.248
Bolt cutters,
wire cutters, a hairpin.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.083
I mean,
I'll settle for a paper clip.

34:58.085 --> 35:00.716
Wait a minute.

35:02.552 --> 35:05.484
All right,
that was not on my wish list.

35:05.486 --> 35:07.184
Unscrew it.

35:08.886 --> 35:11.452
The Sherlocks are
always prepared.

35:11.454 --> 35:15.452
Elementary,
my dear Agent Torres.

35:17.821 --> 35:18.785
Everybody on three.

35:18.787 --> 35:20.786
Yeah. One, two, three.

35:22.155 --> 35:24.853
Okay. Right. We shut off
the backup power supply

35:24.855 --> 35:26.053
and we turn it back on again.

35:26.055 --> 35:27.754
Wait, just like I do
with my phone?

35:27.756 --> 35:29.487
It can't be as simple as that.

35:29.489 --> 35:31.754
It's not. A sudden power boot
could overload

35:31.756 --> 35:35.254
the internal data servers
and fry the whole system.

35:35.256 --> 35:37.855
- Or destroy years of digital files.
- Shh!

35:37.857 --> 35:39.489
Nobody told you to speak.

35:39.491 --> 35:41.056
She's right.

35:41.058 --> 35:42.656
This may not work.

35:43.691 --> 35:45.290
Do it, McGee.

35:59.427 --> 36:00.492
Stay with me, Tony.

36:05.261 --> 36:08.327
Please tell me it worked.

36:10.162 --> 36:12.761
Okay. Okay, we got it.

36:12.763 --> 36:14.095
- We got it.
- Yes! - Yes, yes.

36:14.097 --> 36:16.595
I just need a minute
to get the building back online.

36:16.597 --> 36:18.128
Start with the doors, please!

36:18.130 --> 36:20.229
Director.

36:20.231 --> 36:22.362
What is it now?

36:22.364 --> 36:23.829
We got a fire alarm here.

36:23.831 --> 36:25.529
All right. Tony,

36:25.531 --> 36:26.996
let's get you out of here.

36:26.998 --> 36:29.363
Abby.

36:29.365 --> 36:32.130
II got to get to Abby.

36:44.968 --> 36:47.266
We're gonna need an EMT.

36:47.268 --> 36:49.300
Officer Reeves. Director.

36:49.302 --> 36:50.934
There's a fire
in the evidence garage.

36:50.936 --> 36:52.300
I've got a team
headed that way, sir.

36:52.302 --> 36:53.301
Any word from Gibbs?

36:53.303 --> 36:54.201
He radioed for backup,

36:54.203 --> 36:55.434
then went silent. Nothing since.

36:55.436 --> 36:56.367
Try again.

36:56.369 --> 36:59.035
Gibbs, come in.

36:59.937 --> 37:02.202
Gibbs.

37:07.338 --> 37:09.636
Gibbs would never leave
his weapon.

37:09.638 --> 37:11.203
Director, we'll find him.

37:11.205 --> 37:13.337
Got an extra weapon?

37:14.005 --> 37:16.637
Go.

37:20.507 --> 37:22.138
Hurry up.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.305
Move it.

37:46.478 --> 37:49.009
It's over, Gibbs!

37:59.646 --> 38:02.078
Try again, Gibbs!

38:04.080 --> 38:06.011
There's no need.

38:29.951 --> 38:30.982
Gibbs.

38:30.984 --> 38:32.216
You okay?

38:32.218 --> 38:34.749
That was some nice shooting,
Leon!

38:35.651 --> 38:37.283
It's our house.

38:37.285 --> 38:39.183
Had to defend it.

38:39.185 --> 38:41.383
Is that my weapon?

38:48.687 --> 38:50.486
I tried to stop her.

38:50.488 --> 38:53.219
I hope we're not too late. 206.

39:04.623 --> 39:07.421
My God.

39:07.423 --> 39:09.589
Abby.

39:10.524 --> 39:11.988
Hey, guys.

39:13.824 --> 39:15.356
What did I miss?

39:16.924 --> 39:18.857
Abby, we thought you suffocated.

39:18.859 --> 39:21.023
No. In order for this to work,

39:21.025 --> 39:22.290
I had to conserve air.

39:22.292 --> 39:23.491
I guess I just...

39:23.493 --> 39:25.424
fell asleep.

39:25.426 --> 39:27.691
You wanted to be locked
in there?

39:27.693 --> 39:28.757
Well, yeah.

39:28.759 --> 39:30.692
I mean, it was better
than getting shot.

39:30.694 --> 39:32.458
And the bad guy didn't know that

39:32.460 --> 39:34.992
I sleep in a coffin anyway.

39:34.994 --> 39:36.959
You have weird friends.

39:36.961 --> 39:38.326
Thank you.

39:40.828 --> 39:42.494
What was that?

39:51.063 --> 39:52.862
Bishop, you did it.

39:52.864 --> 39:54.728
We did it.

39:59.265 --> 40:02.230
Let's get out of here.

40:06.599 --> 40:09.264
Everybody okay in here?!

40:16.801 --> 40:18.899
He did it. She did it.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.433
Itit was for the good
of the case.

40:23.435 --> 40:26.666
Yeah. I believe you,
Agent Bishop.

40:26.668 --> 40:30.601
Question is, will Ms. Sciuto?

40:36.337 --> 40:38.768
Watch your back, coming through.

40:42.805 --> 40:44.736
Are we sure
these desk guys are legit?

40:44.738 --> 40:47.437
Full cavity search at the front gate.

40:47.439 --> 40:49.604
What's the damage report
on the fire?

40:49.606 --> 40:52.605
A lot of the evidence was
destroyed, including what we had

40:52.607 --> 40:55.171
on our drug kingpin,
Adrian Fincher.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.404
So he avoids prison.

40:57.406 --> 40:59.205
For drug trafficking, yeah.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.839
Meanwhile, one of our own
goes down for treason.

41:01.841 --> 41:04.306
Leslie? Really?

41:04.308 --> 41:05.873
She was always so nice to me.

41:05.875 --> 41:08.740
Well, she's the reason we have
the man behind the whole attack.

41:08.742 --> 41:10.207
So Sloane got her to talk?

41:10.209 --> 41:12.274
Leslie gave up computer records.

41:12.276 --> 41:13.574
Fincher.

41:13.576 --> 41:15.041
He's gonna do more
time for terrorism

41:15.043 --> 41:16.474
than he ever would for drugs.

41:16.476 --> 41:18.475
And that's when Bishop and Jimmy

41:18.477 --> 41:20.142
rush into my lab and found out
that the intruders

41:20.144 --> 41:22.542
had already destroyed,
like, the whole thing.

41:22.544 --> 41:24.543
Isn't that awful? Horrible.

41:24.545 --> 41:27.243
How dare they?

41:27.245 --> 41:28.576
The three of you have a date?

41:28.578 --> 41:30.177
Actually, we all do.

41:30.179 --> 41:33.277
Senior offered to take us out
for drinks tonight.

41:33.279 --> 41:35.178
That includes you, Nick.

41:35.180 --> 41:38.712
Well, I can live with that.

41:38.714 --> 41:40.578
Where's Gibbs?

41:40.580 --> 41:42.212
I wanted to invite him as well.

41:42.214 --> 41:43.745
He said he went out
for some coffee.

41:43.747 --> 41:45.346
That's odd.

41:45.348 --> 41:48.846
Hehe told me he was meeting
Vance at the Pentagon.
