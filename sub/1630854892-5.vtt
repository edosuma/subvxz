00:07.258 --> 00:09.552
Frank Florez.
If you want to know

00:09.552 --> 00:11.512
what he's made of,
find Frank Florez.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.222
Did Patoff ever tell you
about somebody

00:13.222 --> 00:14.890
- named Frank Florez?
- Doesn't ring a bell.

00:14.890 --> 00:19.061
Under my guidance, Mr. Sang,
people will idolize you.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.522
One day,
they'll kneel before you.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.357
You should wear that on Monday.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.192
- Monday?
- Church.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.736
We're meeting Father Stellan.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.822
The situation is more dire
than I anticipated.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.282
Unless we act now,

00:31.282 --> 00:33.659
we will not survive
another six weeks.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.287
Am I his assistant now,
or is it still you?

00:36.287 --> 00:38.247
You are.
I'm his creative liaison.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.708
The game that you liked.
Red button with the CW on it.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.918
You're all set.
Florez? I think I found him.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.463
I installed some stalker-ware
on Patoff's phone.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.968
Mr. Sang will guide us
through the storm.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.059
Hello? Mr. Patoff?

01:40.059 --> 01:42.770
It's a beautiful morning...
Craig.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.358
I'm sorry to call you so early.
I just...

01:47.358 --> 01:50.069
I've been up most of the night
with this bug

01:50.069 --> 01:51.987
that's been going around.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.739
A bug?

01:53.739 --> 01:56.367
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody's
been coming down with it.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.662
It's just, you know,
red eyes and chesty cough.

01:59.662 --> 02:02.957
Anyways, I just wanted
to call you as soon as I could

02:02.957 --> 02:05.543
and, say, uh... you know...

02:08.128 --> 02:11.340
What?

02:11.340 --> 02:13.759
I... I won't be at work today.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.015
Mr. Patoff?

02:20.015 --> 02:22.935
Where will you be instead?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.813
I'll be at home, in bed.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.774
But... Raul's
up to speed on everything,

02:28.774 --> 02:31.318
and I'm contactable by phone
if anything comes up.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.365
Mr. Patoff?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.921
I can see that Mr. Sang
is providing us

03:31.921 --> 03:34.548
with great humor this morning.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.384
Laughter is good
for productivity.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.095
Good for health,
for mental well-being.

03:42.848 --> 03:47.436
And unfortunately,
we start the day with sad news.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.648
Craig Horne,
one of our senior coders,

03:50.648 --> 03:53.484
was taken ill in the night.

03:53.484 --> 03:58.530
Craig was a loyal servant
to Mr. Sang for over two years,

03:58.530 --> 04:02.284
and he'll be a great loss
to our family.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.371
I'll ask you all
to bow your heads

04:05.371 --> 04:07.373
and pray for him.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.220
In happier news,

04:21.220 --> 04:26.100
Ursula from marketing
has relocated to Boston,

04:26.100 --> 04:29.228
where her father is recovering
from a heart episode.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.940
She and her partner, Katherine,
will be nursing him

04:32.940 --> 04:36.276
as they look to restart
their careers in a new state.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.364
I derived from our conversation
that Ursula lies with a woman.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.783
Her office
in the managerial suite

04:42.783 --> 04:44.785
is vacant now.

04:46.704 --> 04:47.830
Who would like it?

04:50.416 --> 04:51.458
Nobody?

05:05.889 --> 05:08.100
I'll let you all decide.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.853
Whoever wants it most
is welcome to it.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.946
Wait. Is he serious?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.830
Oh! Ow! Bitch!

05:39.381 --> 05:41.383
Bitch.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.932
Hey. Are you okay?

05:48.932 --> 05:51.060
I'm in Pomona.
I'm three minutes out

05:51.060 --> 05:53.228
- from Frank Florez's store.
- I thought that

05:53.228 --> 05:55.272
we were heading out there
together this weekend.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.815
I know, but I couldn't wait.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.358
I called in sick,
and I told Patti

05:58.358 --> 06:01.904
that I was going into work,
and I hopped on a train instead.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.782
I'm Ferris fucking Bueller
today.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.742
What did you tell Patoff
you had?

06:06.742 --> 06:08.660
Just the standard
cough splutter.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.912
Be careful, Craig.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.414
You don't know how those two
are connected.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.709
Oh, come on. I got a whole
cover story planned out.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.921
I was sketching wedding bands
on the train. You know me.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.964
It's for Craig.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.634
- We're sending macaroons.
- Okay.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.430
I'm a very convincing liar
when I need to be.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.307
Better than you know.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.308
Bye.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.058
A customer.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.769
Yeah! Hi!
Are you the owner?

07:15.769 --> 07:19.106
Frank Florez.
Established since 1983.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.316
I was hoping to get
some wedding bands made,

07:21.316 --> 07:22.609
something like this,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.903
with the head
and the tail overlapping.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.655
Thought it'd be really cool.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.491
Do you love this woman?

07:29.491 --> 07:31.994
Yeah, very much.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.996
Don't put an eel on her finger.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.416
It's supposed to be a snake.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.460
Ladies love gold.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.754
Simple.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.965
Traditional.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.218
- How did you hear about me?
- Oh, it was a referral...

07:48.218 --> 07:51.680
from... my friend Milani.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.852
Russian woman?

07:56.852 --> 07:59.271
Perhaps long ago.

07:59.271 --> 08:03.275
Yeah. No. I... I think
you'd remember this one.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.403
We actually all have
a mutual friend in common...

08:06.403 --> 08:08.488
Regus Patoff.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.762
Uh, did I... did I say
something to upset you?

08:31.762 --> 08:35.557
Registered at the
United States Patent Office.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.935
Excuse me?

08:37.935 --> 08:40.395
Regus Patoff.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.106
You asked me if I knew him,

08:43.106 --> 08:45.359
and I'm telling you...

08:45.359 --> 08:49.154
he... doesn't... exist.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.574
Oh, I'm sorry. I know that I've
made a huge mistake coming here.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.076
Regus Patoff
is no friend of mine.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.245
If you just unlock the gates,
I won't bother you again,

08:56.245 --> 08:57.704
I promise you.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.544
You met him?

09:04.544 --> 09:05.629
What?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.215
In the flesh?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.217
You've seen him?

09:13.387 --> 09:16.598
Every fucking day
from 10:00 to 6:00.

09:18.016 --> 09:22.020
Now... you wanna tell me
how you know him?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.569
Come on back.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.088
We have the build budget
for Upskirt Jungle.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.090
It tentatively starts testing
next week,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.551
and right now,
it's a tentative maybe,

09:52.551 --> 09:56.555
unless we venture
into overtime, and...

09:59.891 --> 10:02.144
Eric thinks he deserves it,

10:02.144 --> 10:06.565
but Trisha will not give it up
without a fight. You'll see.

10:06.565 --> 10:10.485
Things don't usually work
this way around here.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.531
You didn't raise
your arm, Elaine.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.742
I noticed.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.202
Am I to assume
that you do not want

10:19.202 --> 10:22.873
an office
in the managerial suite?

10:22.873 --> 10:24.958
I would love one,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.210
but when I get
my own office,

10:27.210 --> 10:28.962
it will be
through merit.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.050
Ah, merit is a much overrated
commodity in business.

10:33.050 --> 10:36.011
Who climbs
to the top of the tree,

10:36.011 --> 10:38.055
that's who succeeds.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
I know
she doesn't deserve it.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.358
Is this your office?

10:49.358 --> 10:51.443
I don't work much these days.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.613
Yeah.
It's tough out there.

10:54.613 --> 10:58.450
This is the first piece
I ever made for him.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.874
What is it, a tie pin?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.335
I didn't know myself...

11:08.335 --> 11:10.337
at first.

11:11.797 --> 11:15.384
We used to get
a lot of doctors in here.

11:15.384 --> 11:18.804
There's a hospital
three blocks away,

11:18.804 --> 11:22.766
and they'd sometimes browse
during their shift breaks.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.770
She said she wanted
something made,

11:26.770 --> 11:29.648
a gift for a special person.

11:56.675 --> 12:01.680
It had to be precise
to her measurements.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.682
That was the only stipulation.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.945
This is the first time
I ever saw his name.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.574
Over the next three years,

12:20.574 --> 12:24.953
I would see it 205 more times.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.000
Hi.
This is Rosie from CompWare.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.502
I left a voicemail yesterday,
but I'm still waiting

12:32.502 --> 12:34.504
for someone to get back to me.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.147
Patti.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.523
Hey, Raul. How you doing?

12:53.523 --> 12:56.234
Shit. Are... are you here
to take his stuff away?

12:56.234 --> 12:57.360
What?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.946
Patti. Hi!

12:59.946 --> 13:02.199
- Elaine.
- Yes. The drinks thing.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.367
We had a bit of a shuffle

13:04.367 --> 13:07.662
around here, so why don't I show
you where everything is now?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.748
- Okay.
- Yeah.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.708
Congratulations
on your engagement!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.335
- Oh.
- Yeah. Craig was telling me

13:13.335 --> 13:15.295
he was thinking about designing
matching rings.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.590
Oh, I'd love to see him try.
Where is Captain Lazy?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.593
Um... I think he went out
with the others.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.763
A lunch meeting.
Boring tech stuff.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.806
Brought sushi.
Wanted to surprise him.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.808
Oh, Passion Roll.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.102
He likes their
crunchy rice.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.813
Mm.
Well, I'll call him. Um...

13:33.813 --> 13:34.981
Okay.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.150
It was nice
to see you, um...

13:37.150 --> 13:38.193
- Elaine.
- Elaine.

13:38.193 --> 13:41.112
Yeah.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.531
Leave a message.
Thanks.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.950
Hey, babe. I'm at your office.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.369
Where are you? Call me back.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.747
- We have a guest.
- Oh!

13:50.747 --> 13:52.290
Mr. Patoff, this is Patti.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.668
- She...
- You're Patoff.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.086
The Patoff.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.964
You must be Craig's fiancée.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.425
How are you coping
in this impossible time?

14:02.425 --> 14:06.596
What can your CompWare family
do to help?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.307
- What's that?
- Craig's sickness.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.477
He telephoned me this morning
and sounded close to the end.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.688
- Craig called in sick?
- I think there's been

14:14.688 --> 14:16.815
- some miscommunication or...
- Elaine...

14:16.815 --> 14:19.442
Sorry. I corrected
those budget items.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.278
They are on your desk.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.280
I'll get on that.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.200
I appear to have upset you.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.202
It's not you.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.586
Leave a message.
Thanks.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.671
You're in deep shit.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.673
Call me.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.829
Your battery is drained.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.372
No.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.211
You'll only make
the situation worse.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.553
Rosie can call you a mechanic,
and you can wait inside.

15:28.553 --> 15:29.721
I'm fine out here.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.014
It's 100 degrees.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.141
Your air conditioning
will not work,

15:33.141 --> 15:35.143
and your sushi will rot.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.921
They kept coming in.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.300
One a week.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
Two a week.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.852
I'd never know when the next one
was gonna walk through the door.

16:23.441 --> 16:27.445
They had me working
day and night.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.243
The money was so good.

16:33.243 --> 16:38.415
The kids were in college.
I... I couldn't say no!

16:38.415 --> 16:40.417
Betty understood...

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
...for most of it.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.967
I couldn't keep up.

16:48.967 --> 16:53.263
The pieces kept getting bigger,
more intricate.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.897
I was buying all the gold
I could get my hands on.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.693
Local suppliers.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.778
Overseas markets.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.907
And when that wasn't enough...

17:16.202 --> 17:18.204
I turned to my beloved.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.528
How are
the wedding preparations?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.280
Oh, pretty much there.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.700
Um, of course, it's down to me
to plan the whole circus.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.368
- Circus?
- Oh.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.496
No, no,
not literally.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.706
- Ah.
- No. Um, the church is booked.

18:01.706 --> 18:02.916
The people are invited.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.084
The only thing
that could derail us now

18:05.084 --> 18:07.796
is if Craig doesn't show up
to his RCIA classes.

18:07.796 --> 18:11.758
Mm. If he cannot show up
to work...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.760
Oh, I... I know he...
he looks

18:13.760 --> 18:16.012
like he doesn't try
half the time,

18:16.012 --> 18:18.473
but he's a good guy.
I love him.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.477
Well, I don't know Craig
very well,

18:22.477 --> 18:24.687
but you know what I see in him?

18:24.687 --> 18:26.523
Mm.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.108
The love he holds
for another.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.655
That's so sweet.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.448
Thank you.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.451
You know, you are not at all
like he described you.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.328
I can only imagine

18:40.328 --> 18:42.872
the gossip they're spreading
about the new boss.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.291
Well, you... you came
at a difficult time.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.628
You know, the whole Sang thing.
It's just... horrible.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.173
If it helps them to see me
as a monster, so be it.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.134
Enough about me.
I'm interested in you, Patricia.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.594
- Oh.
- What do you do?

18:56.594 --> 18:59.347
Well, I work for a plastic
surgeon in Beverly Hills.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.182
We mostly do body contouring...

19:01.182 --> 19:03.059
like, sucking stuff out,
stretching,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.478
removing the odd rib
here and there.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.314
Sounds like it could
almost be one of our games.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.192
Yes.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.737
How about me?
What would you improve?

19:14.737 --> 19:17.365
- My nose, perhaps?
- Mm...

19:17.365 --> 19:19.492
You look pretty symmetrical
to me.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.870
And you're in good shape.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.584
Oh, it looks
like I'm ready to roll.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.629
But, uh,
thank you so much,

19:31.629 --> 19:33.673
Mr. Patoff,
for keeping me company.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
- Regus.
- Oh, right. Regus.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
I don't work for you.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.554
Yet.

19:39.554 --> 19:43.933
Right. Well... thank you.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.982
He replaced the battery.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.275
Oh. How much?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.527
Mr. Patoff took care of it.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.404
Oh.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.450
- Excuse...
- Oh!

20:00.450 --> 20:02.785
Um...

20:02.785 --> 20:07.123
Um... do you need help?

20:07.123 --> 20:09.292
- I'll get there.
- Can I make a suggestion?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.044
I've worked with people
with disabilities,

20:11.044 --> 20:15.465
and I... I think
I may be able to help.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.925
Regus Patoff
commissioned you

20:16.925 --> 20:18.927
to make a solid gold skeleton?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.220
Not directly.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.680
Up to 20 different doctors,

20:22.680 --> 20:25.767
specialists in their
own fields.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.687
In today's prices...

20:29.687 --> 20:34.233
...$25 million of gold.

20:36.152 --> 20:40.490
After I cast the skull,

20:40.490 --> 20:44.619
I didn't leave the house
for a year.

20:44.619 --> 20:48.623
I couldn't stop
seeing him everywhere.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.170
That's when it all
started to disappear...

20:55.713 --> 20:59.217
...the passing trade,

20:59.217 --> 21:01.219
the neighborhood...

21:04.931 --> 21:08.351
...and eventually, Betty.

21:15.984 --> 21:20.113
I'm sorry that he did that
to you, Frank.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.990
Where is he now?

21:21.990 --> 21:24.117
He's in Los Angeles.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.828
He's a... consultant.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.997
One day, he just moved
into our firm,

21:28.997 --> 21:31.290
and he took over.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.917
Describe him for me.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.919
Patoff?
He's just a regular guy.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.549
How tall?

21:41.718 --> 21:43.428
About up to here.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.763
He's trim. He's angular.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.016
He's greying.

21:48.016 --> 21:52.020
And he's got
these "fuck you" eyes.

21:53.271 --> 21:57.025
How much...
does he weigh?

21:59.527 --> 22:02.238
Alright. Now,
remember what I taught you.

22:02.238 --> 22:06.200
There's a straight line
dropping down from the sky

22:06.200 --> 22:08.619
through your core.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.997
Yes, yes, that's it.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.373
Good job.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.624
Right.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.128
Oh. Yes. Three more.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.963
You can do it.

22:18.963 --> 22:22.008
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes. You got this.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.177
You got it. You got it.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.845
You got it. You're doing it.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.847
Okay.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.601
One more.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.691
Thank you.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.237
Okay.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.659
Oh, my God.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.875
My fiancée's checking in on me.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.669
Swear to God,
she calls me 25 times a day.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.755
When is the wedding?

23:00.755 --> 23:03.382
September.
It's a whole church deal.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.010
Somehow, I got me a good
old-fashioned Catholic girl.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.096
Hey, babe.
I'm at your office.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.056
Where are you? Call me back.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.682
Oh, fuck.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.935
Whatever you do,

23:13.935 --> 23:15.978
don't lose her to him.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.189
I...I think I got
to get back.

23:18.189 --> 23:21.150
- Thank you.
- Mm.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.547
Ow!

23:42.547 --> 23:44.549
Ah!

24:27.425 --> 24:32.722
He knows you're here.
Go. Go, go, go.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.113
Stop it! Stop it!

24:54.076 --> 24:56.329
Stop!
Stay out of it, Elaine.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.874
No! Stop it! Stop it! Ah!

24:59.874 --> 25:02.043
You know how hard
Eric's worked for this.

25:04.378 --> 25:08.382
You're not getting away
with this, Janelle!

25:23.105 --> 25:25.149
I'm busy!
Come back later!

25:29.028 --> 25:31.739
- Iain?
- Oh, thank God it's just you.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.492
Uh, shut the door behind you.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.792
- Are you okay?
- They are savages.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.503
I mean, you saw
what they just did to Trisha.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.339
Everybody's been on edge
since he's arrived.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.216
They're not thinking straight.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.926
You can excuse that behavior?

25:51.926 --> 25:55.429
- No! Of course not!
- What if they come for me next?

25:55.429 --> 25:57.431
I don't do well
around conflict, Elaine.

25:57.431 --> 26:00.268
I never even wanted
this damn office.

26:00.268 --> 26:03.729
I'd be happy working on the...
on the steps.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.898
- You would?
- You'd tell me if they were

26:05.898 --> 26:09.610
planning something,
wouldn't you?

26:12.863 --> 26:14.865
Well, uh...

26:16.659 --> 26:18.577
...there has been some talk.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.915
Oh, God. Oh God...

26:22.915 --> 26:25.293
Who? Who are they sending?

26:26.794 --> 26:29.088
Hasn't been decided yet.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.133
I don't know how to fight.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.302
I'll just hang something white
outside the door!

26:34.302 --> 26:37.471
I'll surrender!
It's not embarrassing, is it?

26:38.889 --> 26:41.642
I might be able
to help you out, Iain,

26:41.642 --> 26:45.646
just until all of this
blows over.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.364
Craig!

27:02.038 --> 27:04.040
Hey. Hey.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.418
What are you doing home?

27:07.418 --> 27:11.088
Oh, I felt sick on the way in,
so I headed back.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.050
Sorry. I should've told you.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.635
I brought sushi in for you.
You weren't there.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.721
Oh, babe.
You went into the office?

27:18.721 --> 27:21.432
That's so romantic.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.517
I ran into that Elaine girl.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.979
Missing-tooth Elaine?

27:26.979 --> 27:29.982
The other one. She thought
you were in a lunch meeting?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.650
Oh.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.652
You know. Ditzy Elaine.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.531
You're hot.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.576
You're ghost white.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.620
I told you. I'm sick.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.959
You rest up, baby.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.878
I'll take care of you.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.880
Thank you.
