WEBVTT

00:29.103 --> 00:30.599
- Did
you ever consider

00:30.601 --> 00:32.565
what would've happened if
any of these substances

00:32.567 --> 00:34.933
were given to say,
unwitting people?

00:37.737 --> 00:38.979
- Oh,
I don't remember

00:38.981 --> 00:41.610
having considered
that specifically, I.

00:43.645 --> 00:46.180
- What
if you, I trust perhaps

00:46.182 --> 00:47.352
you've thought about it.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.821
- Well, I haven't
worried about it.

00:49.823 --> 00:52.785
I, your question again,

00:52.787 --> 00:55.591
what would I have
thought had I known that?

00:57.023 --> 00:57.995
- Any of
these substances would be.

00:57.997 --> 00:59.463
- Would've been given to?

01:00.694 --> 01:02.466
Unwitting persons.

01:02.468 --> 01:06.705
- You mean a hostile agent
of another government?

01:06.707 --> 01:09.405
- No, I mean, test.
- I mean, that's probably
what I had in mind.

01:09.407 --> 01:10.567
- I
mean testing it out

01:10.569 --> 01:11.574
on an American citizen.

01:14.383 --> 01:15.215
- I.

01:20.355 --> 01:25.321
I guess I must seem very,
very cold-blooded about this,

01:25.323 --> 01:29.094
but I don't recall
ever having been

01:29.096 --> 01:33.090
very much preoccupied
with that issue.

02:04.827 --> 02:08.092
- But many drugs
were tested in this way.

02:08.094 --> 02:11.070
A decision was made at the
highest levels of the CIA

02:11.072 --> 02:13.741
to do testing on
unwitting Americans.

02:13.743 --> 02:15.803
As one CIA document says,

02:15.805 --> 02:19.610
"Such testing would be
operationally realistic."

02:19.612 --> 02:23.117
A former CIA official who worked
on these programs describes

02:23.119 --> 02:26.449
for the first time how
the decision was made.

02:26.451 --> 02:28.980
He did not wish to be
filmed or recorded.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.392
Thus, his remarks are
read by someone else.

02:32.394 --> 02:34.520
- I think every
last one of us felt sorry

02:34.522 --> 02:36.830
to attempt this kind of thing.

02:36.832 --> 02:39.231
We knew we were crossing a line.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.395
Every decent kid knows
he shouldn't steal,

02:41.397 --> 02:43.433
but he does it sometimes.

02:43.435 --> 02:45.839
We knew damn well we
didn't want anyone else

02:45.841 --> 02:47.340
to know what we were doing.

05:07.179 --> 05:08.008
- Come to bed.

05:09.985 --> 05:11.242
- I'll be in soon.

05:12.386 --> 05:15.884
- They're gonna approve
the funding. Come.

05:54.724 --> 05:56.119
- This study
aims to provide

05:56.121 --> 05:57.997
a chemical enhancement
of such memories

05:57.999 --> 05:59.331
as to allow the subject

05:59.333 --> 06:02.365
to replay the
role-defining moments

06:02.367 --> 06:03.930
and physicians such as myself,

06:03.932 --> 06:06.665
a path towards
reconstruction of the events

06:06.667 --> 06:08.202
with a variable outcome.

06:08.204 --> 06:10.606
- Given the current
success rates that we're seeing

06:10.608 --> 06:12.809
with the
electroconvulsive therapy,

06:14.074 --> 06:16.813
what would be the
reasoning at this time

06:16.815 --> 06:21.180
that the board would consider
diverting precious funds

06:21.182 --> 06:24.584
to explore a path, which
in my professional opinion,

06:24.586 --> 06:25.591
is already working?

06:26.690 --> 06:28.820
- We're treating
trauma, using trauma.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.629
- I'm painting a picture here.

06:33.299 --> 06:36.399
Like I said, Dr. Strauss here

06:36.401 --> 06:38.571
is looking for taxpayer funding

06:39.737 --> 06:42.734
to test psychedelic
drugs on patients

06:42.736 --> 06:44.478
to alter people's minds.

06:48.209 --> 06:50.481
- Motion
for funding is denied.

06:50.483 --> 06:52.310
Dr. Strauss, thank
you for your time.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.726
- They were looking for
fundamental information

07:36.493 --> 07:38.530
on compounds that were,

07:38.532 --> 07:41.568
that would be capable
of causing changes

07:44.637 --> 07:47.970
in behavior, changes
in mental attitude.

07:50.741 --> 07:51.971
- The
decision was made

07:51.973 --> 07:54.439
to do testing on
unwitting victims.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.449
It was decided they should
be on the fringes of society

07:57.451 --> 07:59.651
because they were
most vulnerable.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.181
- It was the
borderline underworld,

08:01.183 --> 08:04.421
prostitutes, drug addicts,
and other small-timers

08:04.423 --> 08:05.656
that would be powerless to seek

08:05.658 --> 08:07.825
any kind of revenge in
case they found out.

09:40.178 --> 09:42.154
- We're out of time.

09:56.934 --> 09:58.468
- We
had the board denying

09:58.470 --> 09:59.640
Ford's funding today.

10:00.737 --> 10:02.005
It's time to recruit him.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.338
About that subject that escaped,

10:06.748 --> 10:09.812
make sure Townsend gets him
before anybody sees him.

10:09.814 --> 10:11.212
I don't wanna have
to call Langley.

10:13.178 --> 10:16.250
- Don't, no reason to worry 'em.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.385
You'll hear from me.

10:35.266 --> 10:37.238
- Uh, sorry to keep you.

10:40.214 --> 10:41.011
Right, Brian.

10:43.142 --> 10:43.948
- How is he?

10:45.985 --> 10:48.611
- Nurse, would you and Brian
excuse us for a moment?

10:48.613 --> 10:49.986
- Of course,
doctor. - Thank you.

10:49.988 --> 10:52.616
- Come on, Brian, let's
get you to your room.

11:00.434 --> 11:02.698
- Kevin, it's Kevin, right, and?

11:02.700 --> 11:03.899
- Margaret.
- And Margaret,

11:03.901 --> 11:08.066
Kevin and Margaret,
um, like I said,

11:08.068 --> 11:10.774
Brian is a very strong young man

11:10.776 --> 11:13.437
and disabilities
won't change that.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.847
- Is he
still a pig butcher?

11:16.714 --> 11:18.279
It's a simple question, doctor.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.887
He killed eight of my cattle.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.553
Now you fix him or you
keep him, ain't that right?

11:25.555 --> 11:26.386
- All right.

11:29.727 --> 11:31.523
This is Dr. Miller's contact.

11:33.158 --> 11:34.559
He's highly regarded.

11:36.401 --> 11:37.232
Like I say,

11:40.069 --> 11:42.707
a strong young man
there in Brian,

11:42.709 --> 11:45.278
all he needs is
patience and care.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.877
As far as your refund,

11:46.879 --> 11:48.980
feel free to take that
up with the state.

11:48.982 --> 11:51.878
Nurse, could you show the
Mercers out, thank you.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.017
- Sure, doctor.

12:17.069 --> 12:17.910
- Get in the car.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.443
I wasn't asking.

13:00.486 --> 13:01.448
It's gone to shit.

13:04.991 --> 13:08.389
But this shit reminds me
of why we do what we do.

13:14.098 --> 13:16.197
Gives us a reason to
get up in the morning.

13:16.199 --> 13:20.071
Reason to iron your
suit, shine your shoes.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.437
Gives us men meaning.

13:26.846 --> 13:29.580
You understand that,
don't you, Ford?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.183
You're a Kraut, Strauss?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.717
Strauss is a Kraut name, right?

13:43.692 --> 13:44.524
- No.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.593
- Ah, that's too bad.

13:49.636 --> 13:51.194
'Cause then you'd understand.

13:51.196 --> 13:52.103
- Understand what?

13:53.269 --> 13:55.706
- Understand that if
we turn our eyes away

13:55.708 --> 13:58.736
for even a moment, one moment,

14:00.679 --> 14:03.213
filth will overcome us.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.824
- What does any of this
have to do with me?

14:10.826 --> 14:13.520
- Because I'm gonna fund
your research, Dr. Ford.

14:20.034 --> 14:22.766
- Why would the Bureau of
Narcotics fund research

14:22.768 --> 14:24.298
into psychological psychedelia?

14:24.300 --> 14:26.434
- Because I'm
a company man first.

14:28.475 --> 14:29.305
- What company?

14:32.943 --> 14:34.712
- The potential that you have

14:34.714 --> 14:38.248
to accomplish here is singular.

14:39.644 --> 14:41.647
To push the
boundaries of science,

14:42.791 --> 14:44.419
with the full support
of the government.

14:45.954 --> 14:47.587
- And in exchange?

14:52.027 --> 14:53.131
- The chance to learn.

14:56.398 --> 14:58.763
With access to your
research, your patients,

15:01.943 --> 15:04.802
maybe even a chance to
help fix the broken, hm?

15:21.688 --> 15:26.692
Ford, look forward to
hearing from you soon.

15:32.373 --> 15:33.204
Understand?

15:39.039 --> 15:39.870
That's good.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.286
- In the
Guatemalan foothills

15:52.288 --> 15:54.290
there's a mysterious
training depot,

15:54.292 --> 15:56.753
where some of the raiders
may have been based.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.557
The government there
denies that Cubans

15:58.559 --> 16:00.294
are among the soldiers
being instructed,

16:00.296 --> 16:02.364
but observers have
said otherwise.

16:02.366 --> 16:04.597
Professional soldiers
are among the teachers

16:04.599 --> 16:08.569
and once trained, a man
can seriously disappear.

16:08.571 --> 16:11.303
Guatemala has held no briefs
with the Castro regime,

16:11.305 --> 16:12.573
and has aided the rebels.

16:17.350 --> 16:20.213
In Cuba itself, the people
have been exhorted by Castro

16:20.215 --> 16:22.020
to push back the invaders.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.848
And 300,000 militia
men have mobilized.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.286
The invasion was successful
in its early hours

16:27.288 --> 16:28.789
with Castro of course blaming-

16:28.791 --> 16:29.623
- Ford?

16:32.590 --> 16:34.892
Sweetheart, I picked up dinner.

16:38.837 --> 16:40.606
Are you in your office?

16:40.608 --> 16:41.833
I brought us supper.

16:43.537 --> 16:44.735
Denies that Cubans

16:44.737 --> 16:46.373
are among the soldiers
being instructed,

16:46.375 --> 16:48.911
but observers have
said otherwise.

16:48.913 --> 16:50.083
- What can I do?

16:52.180 --> 16:53.284
- I told you, nothing.

16:56.722 --> 16:57.882
- Come.

17:22.482 --> 17:23.314
- Hey.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.752
Hey.

17:27.754 --> 17:29.853
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:29.855 --> 17:32.188
It's not you, okay?

17:32.190 --> 17:33.852
It's not you.
- Then what is it?

17:36.125 --> 17:38.621
- I don't, I don't know.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.490
- Is it, is it us?

17:40.492 --> 17:42.927
- No, no, it's not us.

17:44.663 --> 17:46.400
- Then is it me?
Because I can't-

17:46.402 --> 17:50.506
- No, of course,
of course not, no.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.006
Something happened today.

17:57.550 --> 17:58.382
- What?

18:01.483 --> 18:03.387
- After they passed,
I got an offer.

18:04.888 --> 18:05.719
- By who?

18:07.222 --> 18:08.887
- It's federal.

18:10.462 --> 18:12.963
- Federal, why I thought
that's what you always wanted.

18:12.965 --> 18:16.395
- Yeah, but this is different,

18:16.397 --> 18:19.832
they want control, access.

18:24.442 --> 18:26.909
I can't figure
out what to make of 'em.

18:26.911 --> 18:30.407
- Who?

18:30.409 --> 18:32.476
- I don't know.

19:38.214 --> 19:39.780
- Come on, wake up.

19:42.680 --> 19:47.660
There you go.

19:47.662 --> 19:48.723
There you go.

19:50.928 --> 19:51.759
Thank you.

19:55.532 --> 19:58.964
Won't you get in, get
in, watch your head.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.941
There you go.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.665
- Nurse Irwin?

20:26.667 --> 20:27.663
Nurse Irwin.

20:36.170 --> 20:36.969
Nurse?

20:41.981 --> 20:43.140
Nurse, what are you?

20:48.684 --> 20:51.214
What in the hell do
you think you're doing?

20:51.216 --> 20:54.222
- The patient is
prepped for the leukotomy.

20:54.224 --> 20:55.152
- Thank you, nurse.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.399
- Un-prep him, you're not
lobotomizing my fucking patient.

21:00.401 --> 21:03.369
- Mr. Mercer is no longer
your patient, Dr. Strauss.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.305
Step aside.

21:07.104 --> 21:08.000
- The hell I will.

21:12.311 --> 21:15.007
- You gotta be
careful, Dr. Strauss.

21:48.746 --> 21:50.675
- It's me.
- Yes, okay, I'll do it,

21:50.677 --> 21:52.785
but I need a favor, right now.

22:08.268 --> 22:11.129
- Will you fucking
get that, please?

22:14.974 --> 22:15.898
- It's for you.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.370
- For fuck sake.

24:40.916 --> 24:42.614
- Um, I have to be
work at some point,

24:42.616 --> 24:46.119
so how long you?

25:04.274 --> 25:05.072
What's this?

25:29.867 --> 25:32.195
- Hello, Dr.
Strauss, I'm Agent Dwyer.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.531
I'm a colleague
of Agent Morgan's.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.170
And I'm here to ask you a
few questions this morning.

25:42.106 --> 25:44.144
- All right, what is this place?

25:47.015 --> 25:50.485
- All right, I'm gonna
need you to relax.

25:50.487 --> 25:51.690
Take a few deep breaths.

25:52.955 --> 25:55.257
- It's a little hard
with the hood, and-

25:55.259 --> 25:56.090
- Breathe.

25:57.532 --> 25:58.356
Huh,
are you ready to begin?

26:04.839 --> 26:06.303
- Yes.

26:06.305 --> 26:07.563
- State your full name.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.539
- You just said it a moment ago.

26:10.541 --> 26:12.139
- Don't make him repeat himself.

26:13.645 --> 26:15.615
- Again,
state your full name.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.813
- Ford Joseph Strauss.

26:18.815 --> 26:21.984
- State of birth.
- Pennsylvania.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.422
- Answer each of the
following questions

26:26.424 --> 26:28.320
with only a yes or a no.

26:29.530 --> 26:31.464
Are you connected to
or pledge allegiance

26:31.466 --> 26:33.664
to the beliefs of
the communist party

26:33.666 --> 26:36.869
or organizations within
the communist party?

26:36.871 --> 26:37.703
- No.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.296
- Are you a member or have ties

26:40.298 --> 26:42.708
to extremist groups
or organizations

26:43.774 --> 26:45.909
with desire to
overthrow or challenge

26:45.911 --> 26:48.409
the sovereignty of the
United States government?

26:48.411 --> 26:49.242
- No.

26:51.544 --> 26:54.844
- Do you have any
debt or financial obligations?

26:54.846 --> 26:55.853
- No.

26:57.522 --> 27:00.121
- Do you use drugs or alcohol?

27:02.958 --> 27:05.021
- Socially, but
only really only on-

27:05.023 --> 27:07.856
- Yes or no?

27:07.858 --> 27:08.701
- Yes.

27:09.961 --> 27:10.802
- Both?

27:13.765 --> 27:14.597
- Yes.

27:18.669 --> 27:22.113
- Do you consider yourself
reliable and trustworthy?

27:22.115 --> 27:23.144
- I do, yes.

27:34.251 --> 27:35.585
- I have one more question.

27:41.896 --> 27:44.066
Do you trust Agent Morgan?

27:49.177 --> 27:51.169
- What?
- I said,

27:51.171 --> 27:54.378
do you trust Agent
Galvin Morgan?

28:06.151 --> 28:07.419
- That's a joke.

28:08.692 --> 28:10.059
- You're good to go, doc.

28:12.366 --> 28:13.826
Ah, pleasure meeting you.

28:13.828 --> 28:15.292
- Yeah, you as well.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.002
- All right, open
up your arm there.

28:17.004 --> 28:17.836
- Yeah.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.136
- Thank
you, Dr. Strauss.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.719
- It's your consulting in
confidentiality agreement.

28:35.721 --> 28:37.581
It's just procedural,
we all sign in.

28:40.955 --> 28:43.595
- Well, what's it say?

28:43.597 --> 28:45.424
- To keep your
fucking mouth shut.

28:48.831 --> 28:52.437
- Oh, you, you mean my, my work,

28:52.439 --> 28:53.905
it's gonna be my research.

28:53.907 --> 28:57.040
- About us, not to talk
about us, ever, that's all.

28:58.079 --> 28:58.910
Go ahead.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.531
That enough to keep you busy?

29:28.435 --> 29:30.733
- It's enough to drug
the whole fucking state.

29:31.973 --> 29:34.809
Are, ah, we gonna be okay here?

29:34.811 --> 29:36.079
- We got it handled.

29:38.844 --> 29:39.676
- Wow.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.520
- Millions of dollars

29:42.522 --> 29:44.414
would be spent on LSD research

29:44.416 --> 29:46.725
at universities
throughout the country.

29:46.727 --> 29:48.727
And word would begin
to spread on campus

29:48.729 --> 29:51.458
about this so-called
mind-blowing drug.

29:51.460 --> 29:54.895
And suddenly there was the
counterculture of the '60s.

29:54.897 --> 29:57.799
- I give the CIA a total credit

29:57.801 --> 29:59.902
for sponsoring and initiating

29:59.904 --> 30:02.069
the entire
consciousness movement,

30:02.071 --> 30:05.304
counterculture
events of the 1960s.

30:05.306 --> 30:09.140
The CIA funded and
supported and encouraged

30:09.142 --> 30:10.548
hundreds of young psychiatrists

30:10.550 --> 30:12.615
to experiment with this drug.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.265
- Who's that?

30:36.267 --> 30:38.009
- Research assistant.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.047
- Should I introduce myself?

30:46.882 --> 30:47.843
- Doesn't talk much.

30:53.323 --> 30:57.930
- First patient, Luther Donovan,
diagnosed schizophrenic.

30:59.190 --> 30:59.965
- Bring him in.

31:08.837 --> 31:10.569
I am Dr. Strauss.

31:13.414 --> 31:14.639
Tell me about yourself.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.017
- Shelly
Powers, arsonist.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.085
- Show her in.

31:41.373 --> 31:45.538
Shelly, tell me what happened
the night of March 3rd, 1959.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.409
- My parents died.

31:50.817 --> 31:52.248
- And how
did that fire start?

31:54.888 --> 31:58.251
- Doctor, patient
nine, Desmond Wallace.

31:58.253 --> 32:00.790
- Hello, Mr. Wallace,
I'm Dr. Strauss.

32:00.792 --> 32:02.561
Tell me about your addiction.

32:02.563 --> 32:04.257
I like Wallace and Shelly.

32:04.259 --> 32:06.097
Let's see what the
afternoon brings.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.298
- Keep moving.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.335
- Who is that?

32:12.337 --> 32:14.897
- Laurence Stanley, he was
transferred in this morning.

32:15.941 --> 32:18.775
- Arrest?
- It was non-voluntary.

32:18.777 --> 32:21.178
- Schedule her in.
- Him.

32:31.624 --> 32:33.091
- Why were you arrested?

32:36.090 --> 32:37.128
- Look at me.

32:38.727 --> 32:39.559
- I am.

32:41.028 --> 32:42.199
- Then why ask?

32:43.365 --> 32:44.828
- It's my job
to ask questions.

32:47.038 --> 32:48.766
- Doesn't sound
like much of a job.

32:49.739 --> 32:50.537
- It can be.

32:54.945 --> 32:56.875
- You have a cigarette?

32:56.877 --> 32:57.676
- I do.

33:00.016 --> 33:01.482
- Well, can I have one?

33:03.986 --> 33:04.980
- Don't see why not.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.663
- How long
do I have to be here?

33:18.529 --> 33:19.995
- Until you're healthy.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.075
- You think I'm sick?

33:26.075 --> 33:27.310
- I don't know, Laurence.

33:30.816 --> 33:32.117
Did I say something wrong?

33:37.953 --> 33:38.783
- It's Laura.

33:40.685 --> 33:45.460
- Laura, I'm running
a drug study.

33:46.799 --> 33:49.560
- So you wanna drug me up and?

33:49.562 --> 33:51.833
- Help you
re-find yourself.

33:56.603 --> 33:57.676
- I'm sorry
to disappoint doctor,

33:57.678 --> 33:59.078
but this is all you'll find.

34:01.139 --> 34:04.314
- Then you'll be released and
at least you'll have some fun.

34:09.846 --> 34:11.449
- I'll do it if I
can be transferred

34:11.451 --> 34:12.987
to the ward with
the other girls.

34:12.989 --> 34:14.390
- That is not an option.

34:15.454 --> 34:20.462
- Nurse, wait outside. Now.

34:29.509 --> 34:30.307
She's right.

34:31.604 --> 34:33.068
But what if I find
you your own room?

34:39.183 --> 34:41.219
- And I want my
cross and my hair.

34:45.225 --> 34:48.457
- Good, look forward to be
working with you, Laura.

34:52.063 --> 34:53.726
Send in the next
patient, please.

34:56.770 --> 34:58.769
- I have Mr. Mercer for you.

34:58.771 --> 34:59.963
- Good afternoon, Brian.

35:19.056 --> 35:20.588
You ready to try something new?

35:23.753 --> 35:26.088
Gender dysphoria and addiction.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.175
It's a good spectrum.

35:39.278 --> 35:41.510
Could have guessed you
wouldn't say anything.

35:55.123 --> 35:56.118
- Goodnight, doc.

35:58.026 --> 35:59.022
- Goodnight.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.652
- The
hallucinogens are drugs

37:00.654 --> 37:03.260
whose primary effects
are on the mind.

37:03.262 --> 37:06.328
So they are frequently
called psychedelic.

37:06.330 --> 37:10.268
They include mescaline
and psilocybin.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.063
The best known is
lysergic acid diethylamide

37:14.065 --> 37:16.935
derived from a fungus
that grows on rye grain.

37:17.878 --> 37:20.102
Pure LSD is very powerful.

37:20.104 --> 37:23.546
One ounce is enough for
300,000 average doses.

37:24.978 --> 37:27.383
Extensive experimentation
has failed to establish

37:27.385 --> 37:31.179
a medical use for LSD,
but study continues,

37:31.181 --> 37:33.557
and the legal supply of
the drug is restricted

37:33.559 --> 37:36.757
for use in these carefully
supervised research settings.

37:38.156 --> 37:42.197
- This is where I
have my effect, in the mind.

37:42.199 --> 37:43.996
That seven inches of inner space

37:43.998 --> 37:47.603
between the root of the nose
and the back of the head.

37:47.605 --> 37:50.474
It is, on all accounts,
man's most prized possession.

37:51.607 --> 37:53.609
And in many ways,
his most complicated.

37:54.871 --> 37:56.279
I'm like a depth charge here,

37:56.281 --> 37:58.449
among the brain's
12 billion cells,

37:59.549 --> 38:01.351
but it's one of my
most perplexing secrets

38:01.353 --> 38:03.751
that no one really
knows yet how I work.

38:04.918 --> 38:07.056
Some have suggested that
I affect the midbrain,

38:07.058 --> 38:08.853
the brain's computer,

38:08.855 --> 38:10.462
and prevent it from
regulating signals

38:10.464 --> 38:14.993
from the eyes and the ears
and the other sense organs.

38:14.995 --> 38:18.269
But while there's much
uncertainty about how I work,

38:18.271 --> 38:21.538
there is no uncertainty
about what I can do.

38:24.103 --> 38:27.574
With just a very few micrograms
of me inside the body,

38:27.576 --> 38:29.907
colors, shapes,
smells, textures,

38:29.909 --> 38:32.348
the whole range of
things that can be seen,

38:32.350 --> 38:34.678
heard, smelled,
touched, and tasted

38:34.680 --> 38:36.551
take on incredible distortions

38:36.553 --> 38:38.654
which seem absolutely
and totally real.

38:40.622 --> 38:42.920
With just a few
micrograms of me,

38:42.922 --> 38:45.957
all sorts of hallucinations
are possible.

38:45.959 --> 38:47.460
- I couldn't see
anything except colors.

38:47.462 --> 38:48.696
And I thought, "Well, you know,

38:48.698 --> 38:50.634
this is supposed to be
reality," but it wasn't.

38:50.636 --> 38:54.471
It wasn't anything except just
things that weren't objects.

38:54.473 --> 38:56.197
And after a while you
don't know who you are

38:56.199 --> 38:57.671
and you don't know who
the other person is.

38:57.673 --> 38:59.610
It's happening and
it's happening so fast,

38:59.612 --> 39:03.342
and you can't stop it and
you just can't do anything.

39:03.344 --> 39:04.240
You just have to.

39:05.678 --> 39:06.911
- The most dangerous act

39:06.913 --> 39:09.617
can look attractive
and easy to accomplish

39:09.619 --> 39:11.451
because I can make
those sparkling lights

39:11.453 --> 39:13.654
look colorful and inviting,

39:13.656 --> 39:16.356
a moving tapestry which
can beckon and lure

39:16.358 --> 39:18.589
a traveler to join them.

39:30.439 --> 39:32.067
Well, that's just a rough idea

39:32.069 --> 39:35.573
of what a few
micrograms of me can do.

39:35.575 --> 39:37.008
About the same amount

39:37.010 --> 39:40.210
that you saw in the
point of a pin, remember.

39:41.387 --> 39:43.849
But in spite of my
overwhelming power,

39:43.851 --> 39:45.985
I have yet to kill
anyone from an overdose.

39:47.350 --> 39:50.055
They don't think I'm
physiologically addicting.

39:51.297 --> 39:53.630
And when I'm
swallowed I disappear,

39:53.632 --> 39:56.430
because they haven't yet
perfected a good field test

39:56.432 --> 39:58.162
to detect me inside the body.

39:59.834 --> 40:02.403
Altogether, I'm one
of the most perplexing

40:02.405 --> 40:04.971
and powerful drugs conceivable.

40:36.241 --> 40:38.474
- Day one, initial observation

40:38.476 --> 40:39.940
of patients during
administration

40:39.942 --> 40:42.839
of 400 micrograms of
lysergic acid diethylamide,

40:42.841 --> 40:44.483
without outside interference.

40:45.714 --> 40:47.343
- That's
a heavy dose.

40:49.452 --> 40:50.984
- Might as well jump right in.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.798
- What now?
- We wait.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.669
The effects of the
lysergic acid diethylamide

42:12.671 --> 42:15.134
I'd first seen in subject
two, Shelly Powers.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.605
She exhibits increased
energy and excitement

42:18.607 --> 42:20.308
mixed with minor hallucinations.

42:20.310 --> 42:23.505
- Ah.

42:26.944 --> 42:30.116
It's so, so fucking hot.

42:32.621 --> 42:34.117
- Subject's pupils are dilated

42:34.119 --> 42:37.189
and she exhibits
extreme perspiration.

42:38.759 --> 42:40.456
She's removed her clothing.

42:42.930 --> 42:44.669
- Subject one is
having a reaction.

42:46.129 --> 42:47.834
- Subject one, Brian Mercer,

42:47.836 --> 42:50.834
shows signs of
hyperreflexia onset

42:50.836 --> 42:53.869
and visual discomfort.

42:57.351 --> 42:59.112
- I should get in there.
- Standby.

43:00.176 --> 43:01.476
Subject is experiencing emesis

43:01.478 --> 43:03.919
of common side effect
with chemical induction.

43:05.217 --> 43:06.424
We'll continue monitoring
with suggestion

43:06.426 --> 43:08.187
of lower dosage
for further trials.

43:14.962 --> 43:17.163
Patient one is
experiencing paranoia

43:18.628 --> 43:22.707
and fear of being watched
by unseen being or beings.

43:25.438 --> 43:28.138
Grab a guard and give him 200
milligrams of chlorpromazine

43:28.140 --> 43:30.140
to reduce the effects.
- Yes, doctor.

43:30.142 --> 43:32.816
- And start an IV
for dehydration.

43:37.417 --> 43:40.417
We'll substitute diamorphine
for the patient moving forward.

43:46.123 --> 43:47.595
Patient three, Laurence Stanley,

43:47.597 --> 43:49.332
is subdued in a fetal position.

43:49.334 --> 43:50.966
His knees to his chest.

43:52.571 --> 43:54.503
- Give us this day
our daily bread.

43:54.505 --> 43:56.032
- He mouths words.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.067
- And forgive us our trespasses.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.712
- Can you tell what he's saying?

44:02.874 --> 44:04.412
Is he praying?

44:06.109 --> 44:07.851
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

44:09.245 --> 44:11.448
What the fuck is this shit?

44:12.325 --> 44:14.693
Give me a hit, man, I'm need it.

44:16.693 --> 44:18.959
What the fuck!
- Patient four,

44:18.961 --> 44:21.062
Desmond Wallace shows
heightened emotions.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.701
He is less affected by the LSD

44:23.703 --> 44:25.929
than the other patients
due to potential buildup

44:25.931 --> 44:27.167
of chemical tolerance.

44:28.365 --> 44:30.671
Recommend alternative
0.7 micrograms,

44:30.673 --> 44:33.170
3-part quinuclidinol benzoate.

44:33.172 --> 44:34.570
- How
long will it last?

44:36.116 --> 44:37.012
- Eight hours.

44:38.307 --> 44:39.784
- Eight hours, woah.

45:19.989 --> 45:22.189
- The
last person I'd expect.

45:22.191 --> 45:24.922
- I was just grabbing
the, ah, the Mercer file.

45:24.924 --> 45:26.694
Are you moving offices?

45:26.696 --> 45:30.692
- No. No, I'm, um, I'm not.

45:33.867 --> 45:36.003
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

45:36.005 --> 45:36.835
I mean, you played the
game. I could have.

45:36.837 --> 45:37.666
Have a drink with me.

45:41.845 --> 45:43.639
- I really should be-
- No, no, sit.

45:58.661 --> 46:00.722
You're a good man Ford.

46:07.902 --> 46:09.269
But you need to be careful.

46:12.338 --> 46:14.406
- I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

46:15.816 --> 46:19.444
- Politics and science
make the worst of friends.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.480
- I'm just doing my job.

46:24.985 --> 46:26.286
- I know you believe that.

46:30.396 --> 46:31.962
But medicine is business

46:33.327 --> 46:36.829
and in business you always
have to ask yourself

46:36.831 --> 46:39.563
why, why do they pay?

46:39.565 --> 46:43.903
What do they want that has
that much value to them?

46:43.905 --> 46:46.105
- My intentions are good.

46:46.107 --> 46:47.846
- Your intentions
never worried me.

46:50.317 --> 46:51.278
But what do I know?

46:53.686 --> 46:55.645
I'm just an old
man without a job.

46:58.018 --> 47:00.551
- What, what are you suggesting?

47:05.764 --> 47:08.158
- Into whatsoever
houses I enter,

47:08.160 --> 47:09.967
I will enter to help the sick.

47:11.500 --> 47:15.203
I will abstain from
all intentional
wrong-doing and harm,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.905
especially abusing
the body as a man.

47:18.907 --> 47:21.572
- Or woman, bond or free.

47:23.581 --> 47:26.676
- Follow it and pray.

47:30.787 --> 47:33.056
You laugh.

47:34.354 --> 47:36.224
And science can't
explain everything.

47:37.589 --> 47:40.996
Just a continual evolution
without consequence,

47:40.998 --> 47:45.832
but in life, Jesus,
that's all there is.

47:45.834 --> 47:48.236
Action, consequence.

47:53.106 --> 47:54.638
- What if I just don't believe?

47:59.444 --> 48:04.186
- Hmm, then you
haven't yet been lost.

48:06.825 --> 48:09.224
We all need
something to save us.

48:18.505 --> 48:19.795
- I need your notes, doc.

48:23.369 --> 48:25.537
- Where are you
taking all of this?

48:35.278 --> 48:36.119
- Ask Morgan.

48:38.648 --> 48:40.387
- Tell him I'd like
to talk to him.

48:42.891 --> 48:45.354
- You got his number.

48:51.535 --> 48:52.366
Call him.

50:41.071 --> 50:44.113
- Other experiments
were not as conventional.

50:44.115 --> 50:46.849
Neurophysicist, Dr. Jose
Delgado was financed

50:46.851 --> 50:48.614
by the office of Naval Research.

50:50.154 --> 50:52.453
In this experiment
the bull is sedated.

50:54.388 --> 50:57.159
Electrodes are
implanted in its brain.

50:57.161 --> 50:59.688
Delgado transmits an
electronic impulse

50:59.690 --> 51:01.561
to the center of
the bull's brain.

51:05.466 --> 51:07.897
Delgado has remote
control of the animal.

51:10.108 --> 51:11.571
Recently released
CIA documents refer

51:11.573 --> 51:15.740
to the feasibility of
remote control of animals,

51:15.742 --> 51:18.378
and that special investigations
will be conducted

51:18.380 --> 51:21.015
toward the application
of selected elements

51:21.017 --> 51:23.154
of these techniques to man.

51:49.474 --> 51:53.250
- Dallas, you sees me, Dallas?

51:54.478 --> 51:56.748
Ict see rot, rot, I say.

53:15.195 --> 53:18.131
- Yeah.

53:18.133 --> 53:20.997
- You called?
- Yeah.

53:22.632 --> 53:24.033
Ford's asking questions.

53:25.209 --> 53:26.673
- Just
keep him focused,

53:26.675 --> 53:29.005
we need the facade to
continue for the funding.

53:30.783 --> 53:32.149
- He wants to see you.

53:32.151 --> 53:33.442
- I'll be
there in a week or two,

53:33.444 --> 53:34.612
very busy here.

53:34.614 --> 53:37.711
Our German is making
some progress.

53:37.713 --> 53:39.349
How are things there?

53:39.351 --> 53:40.181
- We moved in.

53:44.257 --> 53:45.560
Dwyer's at work.

53:47.724 --> 53:50.301
- You'll hear from me.

55:10.843 --> 55:14.517
- If I wasn't here,
would you wanna hold it?

55:16.853 --> 55:17.685
- Maybe.

55:26.457 --> 55:27.398
I like you.

55:29.694 --> 55:30.929
- Why do you like me?

55:34.433 --> 55:35.263
- You see me.

55:39.406 --> 55:41.038
- Do others not see you?

55:48.184 --> 55:49.211
- They choose not to.

55:52.220 --> 55:53.149
Always so high.

55:56.323 --> 55:57.494
So I make them.

56:04.597 --> 56:06.030
- Shelly, keep your shirt on.

56:13.738 --> 56:15.138
- Do you want me, Dr. Ford?

56:22.383 --> 56:23.982
I want you to fuck me.

56:28.587 --> 56:31.187
Look at me.

56:33.732 --> 56:34.564
- Nurse.

56:39.998 --> 56:42.231
- Don't make me burn
you, motherfucker.

57:18.874 --> 57:22.810
- Can you get me the
deprivation mask, thank you.

57:28.581 --> 57:29.817
Do you trust me, Brian?

57:34.951 --> 57:36.494
- You can't keep them away.

57:44.062 --> 57:48.836
You, you
can't keep them away.

57:55.444 --> 57:58.447
- I'm going to help you now.

57:58.449 --> 58:00.243
So I need you to
relax for a moment.

58:02.052 --> 58:02.949
Sh, sh, sh.

58:07.521 --> 58:08.889
Slow your breathing.

58:13.724 --> 58:14.829
There you go.

58:17.399 --> 58:21.869
Now this is just a mask.

58:32.215 --> 58:33.045
Can you breathe?

58:41.594 --> 58:43.990
Are you in that field
you've been talking about?

58:45.758 --> 58:48.522
- Yes, it's dark.

58:50.529 --> 58:51.360
And cold.

58:55.404 --> 58:56.607
- Is anyone with you?

59:01.540 --> 59:02.536
- No, alone.

59:04.247 --> 59:05.473
- Alone?

59:08.954 --> 59:09.785
- No. No.

59:13.221 --> 59:14.053
No.

59:16.424 --> 59:17.254
- What is it?

59:18.695 --> 59:20.895
- I, I hear
them, they're coming.

59:22.301 --> 59:24.063
- Who's coming?
- The beasts.

59:27.430 --> 59:28.265
- Leave the field.
- I can't, I can't leave.

59:29.667 --> 59:30.869
- Why not?

59:30.871 --> 59:32.604
- It's locked,
the door's locked.

59:32.606 --> 59:34.035
- Then knock.

59:34.037 --> 59:35.745
- They won't answer.
- Try.

59:37.383 --> 59:38.413
- They won't, they
won't let me in,

59:38.415 --> 59:40.442
and they're coming.
- Who?

59:41.584 --> 59:43.220
- Not till I'm a man.
- Brian?

59:43.222 --> 59:45.245
Who won't let you in Brian?

59:45.247 --> 59:47.152
- They're, they're here.
- Who?

59:48.160 --> 59:49.759
- No, no, no!
- Who?

59:50.625 --> 59:52.696
- No, no, no, no!

59:55.234 --> 59:59.234
No, stop!

1:01:31.724 --> 1:01:32.796
- I need a hit.

1:01:34.023 --> 1:01:35.194
I'm dying here.

1:01:36.158 --> 1:01:37.559
I'm hurting inside.

1:01:41.163 --> 1:01:42.102
- You see this?

1:01:49.907 --> 1:01:51.379
- Give it to me.

1:01:51.381 --> 1:01:52.607
Give it to me now.

1:01:57.882 --> 1:01:58.679
- It's empty.

1:02:00.853 --> 1:02:02.617
- You fucking with me.

1:02:06.155 --> 1:02:07.588
You fucking with me.

1:02:07.590 --> 1:02:10.328
- This is all it provides
your life, nothing.

1:02:11.501 --> 1:02:13.561
Makes you empty inside.

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:16.739
Makes you meaningless,
meaningless and empty.

1:02:26.475 --> 1:02:29.248
- Fucking
with my head.

1:02:41.829 --> 1:02:45.061
- You should rest, drink fluids.

1:02:45.063 --> 1:02:46.694
- What's Laura's status.

1:02:46.696 --> 1:02:49.472
- The 500 micrograms of
lysergic acid diethylamide

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:50.940
kicked in about an hour ago.

1:02:52.202 --> 1:02:53.500
- Then we continue.

1:02:53.502 --> 1:02:54.776
Would you hand me
my spare glasses,

1:02:54.778 --> 1:02:55.476
they should be in
the top drawer.

1:02:55.478 --> 1:02:56.407
- Yes, doctor.

1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:00.378
- Thank you.

1:03:05.556 --> 1:03:06.788
- Everything okay?

1:03:06.790 --> 1:03:09.282
- It's just a
different prescription.

1:03:09.284 --> 1:03:10.790
- Good.

1:03:10.792 --> 1:03:13.795
- Nurse, make sure someone stays

1:03:13.797 --> 1:03:15.060
with patient Powers
at all times.

1:03:15.062 --> 1:03:17.065
I'll be right in.
- Yes, doctor.

1:03:22.532 --> 1:03:25.601
- What
was all that about?

1:03:27.745 --> 1:03:31.013
- He's out. Too
much of a liability.

1:03:32.409 --> 1:03:34.214
We transfer him
to rehabilitation.

1:03:37.885 --> 1:03:39.219
- Talking about the girl.

1:03:42.219 --> 1:03:43.718
Why can't you leave her alone?

1:03:45.662 --> 1:03:49.196
- Shelly, she, ah,

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:52.529
she seems to,

1:03:53.972 --> 1:03:56.071
Shelly's actions seem to
be based on a past series

1:03:56.073 --> 1:03:58.840
of neglect, based on an
addicted parental structure.

1:03:58.842 --> 1:04:02.405
She's ah, she acts
out for attention

1:04:02.407 --> 1:04:04.574
and she's after the
result, not the desire.

1:04:06.650 --> 1:04:08.116
- She liked your pretty face.

1:04:15.818 --> 1:04:19.930
- Well, drugs seem to be
working, at least for these two.

1:04:24.127 --> 1:04:25.326
The real mystery.

1:04:25.328 --> 1:04:27.564
Was this before you were Laura?

1:04:31.644 --> 1:04:34.439
- I have
always been Laura.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:38.744
- Always?

1:04:38.746 --> 1:04:39.576
- Yes.

1:04:41.376 --> 1:04:42.480
- What about Laurence?

1:04:44.521 --> 1:04:46.550
- Always Laura.

1:04:51.529 --> 1:04:52.556
- All right, tell me,

1:04:54.491 --> 1:04:56.197
tell me again
about your parents.

1:04:58.370 --> 1:04:59.398
- I love them.

1:05:01.604 --> 1:05:02.863
They love me.

1:05:04.469 --> 1:05:06.471
- Did they ever do
anything to hurt you?

1:05:08.338 --> 1:05:12.411
- No. I'm their daughter.

1:05:13.508 --> 1:05:15.018
- Then why did you leave home?

1:05:17.284 --> 1:05:19.484
- So people
would stop judging them.

1:05:20.955 --> 1:05:22.322
- Why do people judge them?

1:05:28.192 --> 1:05:29.659
- Only God can judge.

1:05:30.666 --> 1:05:32.198
- I understand.

1:05:32.200 --> 1:05:34.136
And what does God
think about your lying?

1:05:37.501 --> 1:05:39.174
- That's
between him and me.

1:05:40.612 --> 1:05:41.803
- What do you think?

1:05:43.548 --> 1:05:44.641
- That he forgives.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:52.484
Our father who art in heaven.
- What's going on?

1:05:52.486 --> 1:05:55.656
- Hallowed be thy
name, thy kingdom come.

1:05:59.721 --> 1:06:01.031
- Didn't know
you were coming.

1:06:03.096 --> 1:06:05.359
- Should I have called first?

1:06:05.361 --> 1:06:06.531
- No, it's fine.

1:06:08.836 --> 1:06:09.666
- What happened?

1:06:12.339 --> 1:06:13.873
- One of the
patients turned violent.

1:06:13.875 --> 1:06:16.244
- Oh, that's a shame.

1:06:20.313 --> 1:06:22.019
This one over here
is interesting.

1:06:24.513 --> 1:06:25.946
- Actually, she's the only one

1:06:25.948 --> 1:06:27.981
who doesn't seem to be
responding to the treatment.

1:06:29.925 --> 1:06:31.257
You should actually take a look

1:06:31.259 --> 1:06:33.459
at the progress from
patient Brian Mercer.

1:06:34.699 --> 1:06:36.033
- I like this one.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.433
I heard you asked for me.

1:06:48.714 --> 1:06:50.377
- Yes, I
asked weeks ago.

1:06:53.111 --> 1:06:53.974
- Well, I'm here.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:00.087
- I had some questions

1:07:00.089 --> 1:07:02.658
about where my research
is being taken.

1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:03.588
- I like questions.

1:07:06.194 --> 1:07:09.495
- Agent Galvin, I
wanna be very sure

1:07:10.727 --> 1:07:12.661
that we are both on
the same page here.

1:07:12.663 --> 1:07:14.770
- Has your
funding been arriving?

1:07:14.772 --> 1:07:16.172
It's been coming, the money?

1:07:17.605 --> 1:07:20.202
- Yes, but that has nothing to
do with the subject at hand.

1:07:20.204 --> 1:07:21.474
- Do your job.

1:07:24.714 --> 1:07:25.643
Anything else?

1:07:28.410 --> 1:07:29.746
- No.
- Good.

1:07:32.548 --> 1:07:33.882
Keep up the good work, doc.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:01.679
- You okay?

1:08:06.889 --> 1:08:08.257
Lucky it wasn't worse.

1:08:09.418 --> 1:08:13.354
- It's not that.

1:08:13.356 --> 1:08:14.857
- What is it then?

1:08:19.738 --> 1:08:22.238
- I can't figure her out.

1:08:25.333 --> 1:08:26.176
- Who?

1:08:28.879 --> 1:08:33.876
- Patient, down to three now,

1:08:34.609 --> 1:08:37.517
so it's hardly a study.

1:08:38.881 --> 1:08:40.690
Stands little chance
of getting published,

1:08:40.692 --> 1:08:42.654
but there's this one,

1:08:46.928 --> 1:08:48.660
she perplexes me.

1:08:50.828 --> 1:08:53.368
It's like the deeper I
look the less I find.

1:09:00.770 --> 1:09:03.642
- Well, maybe there
isn't anything.

1:09:04.915 --> 1:09:09.351
Maybe you're searching so hard

1:09:10.450 --> 1:09:12.112
because you want
there to be something,

1:09:13.187 --> 1:09:14.851
but there really isn't anything.

1:09:21.392 --> 1:09:22.958
- 50% Success rates.

1:09:25.235 --> 1:09:29.272
It's nothing, it's
the toss of a coin.

1:09:34.637 --> 1:09:37.038
- Then maybe you should stop.

1:09:38.111 --> 1:09:39.007
It's okay to stop.

1:09:41.544 --> 1:09:42.681
Something isn't right.

1:09:49.453 --> 1:09:51.155
- Sorry I'm late.

1:09:51.157 --> 1:09:52.886
- How do you feel?

1:09:52.888 --> 1:09:56.365
- Like shit. Is
everyone prepped?

1:10:00.397 --> 1:10:01.238
Where's Laura?

1:10:02.672 --> 1:10:05.341
- The state came
and took Laurence this morning.

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:09.977
- What you talking about?

1:10:09.979 --> 1:10:11.006
- I thought you knew.

1:10:12.281 --> 1:10:13.976
- Of course I
didn't fucking know.

1:10:28.657 --> 1:10:29.860
- She's gone.

1:10:30.802 --> 1:10:31.925
- That can't happen.

1:10:31.927 --> 1:10:35.932
- It happened.
- That, I, look, look!

1:10:37.376 --> 1:10:40.470
I'm down to two patients,
that is not a fucking study.

1:10:40.472 --> 1:10:41.740
- Get some more.

1:10:43.279 --> 1:10:46.445
- You, this,
we're weeks in,

1:10:46.447 --> 1:10:48.346
you can't just
replicate information,

1:10:48.348 --> 1:10:49.648
it doesn't work like that.

1:10:49.650 --> 1:10:52.212
It, it takes time and I
need her back, come on.

1:10:54.521 --> 1:10:56.150
- You're not gonna
see her again.

1:11:02.692 --> 1:11:04.059
- What's he doing with her?

1:11:10.735 --> 1:11:12.032
Come on, fuck you
with the silence.

1:11:12.034 --> 1:11:14.135
Come on, there's gotta
be something, okay?

1:11:16.176 --> 1:11:17.072
- There's nothing.

1:11:18.675 --> 1:11:19.940
- All right, well I, I guess

1:11:19.942 --> 1:11:21.549
I don't like that
answer very much.

1:11:22.646 --> 1:11:24.453
- No one needs you to be happy.

1:11:27.992 --> 1:11:30.652
- Yes, so what if I'm out too?

1:11:30.654 --> 1:11:32.219
- It's not your choice anymore.

1:11:35.056 --> 1:11:37.367
That's not an option
anymore for you.

1:11:39.003 --> 1:11:44.000
So I suggest you take a moment

1:11:46.238 --> 1:11:47.135
and breathe.

1:11:49.906 --> 1:11:52.349
And then I'll see
you back in there.

1:11:58.516 --> 1:12:00.489
It's time to go to work.

1:13:36.784 --> 1:13:38.515
- The existence
of these safe houses

1:13:38.517 --> 1:13:40.323
was disclosed last year.

1:13:40.325 --> 1:13:42.254
Details of what took
place within them

1:13:42.256 --> 1:13:43.317
has not been told.

1:13:44.793 --> 1:13:47.454
A former CIA official who
worked in the safe houses,

1:13:47.456 --> 1:13:50.330
reveals that they were used
not only for drug testing,

1:13:50.332 --> 1:13:52.435
but to study sexual behavior

1:13:52.437 --> 1:13:55.370
and how it could be used
to manipulate people.

1:13:55.372 --> 1:13:56.602
- We
did quite a study

1:13:56.604 --> 1:13:58.667
of prostitutes and
their behavior.

1:13:58.669 --> 1:14:00.170
How do you take a woman

1:14:00.172 --> 1:14:02.309
who's willing to use her body
to get money out of a guy

1:14:02.311 --> 1:14:03.678
to get him to talk about things

1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.175
which are much more
important, like state secrets?

1:14:26.136 --> 1:14:27.702
- You ready, Brian?

1:14:30.203 --> 1:14:31.035
Okay.

1:14:50.587 --> 1:14:51.594
That's good.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:54.630
That's good.

1:15:02.106 --> 1:15:07.104
- Meh.

1:16:28.885 --> 1:16:33.894
- Laura, Laura?

1:16:36.793 --> 1:16:37.898
Laura! Laura?

1:16:44.274 --> 1:16:47.336
Laura!

1:16:51.806 --> 1:16:53.073
Laura!

1:23:25.032 --> 1:23:29.742
- Police department,
how may I help you?

1:23:51.226 --> 1:23:52.068
- It's me.

1:23:53.201 --> 1:23:54.631
- Where
the fuck you been?

1:23:55.537 --> 1:23:56.369
- Sarah?

1:23:57.334 --> 1:23:59.006
- She's fine.

1:23:59.008 --> 1:24:01.869
Ford's seen too
much, scrub it all.

1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:05.345
- I gotta go.

1:24:26.828 --> 1:24:28.366
- The
day was already underway

1:24:28.368 --> 1:24:30.662
when the Senate prepared
the subcommittee,

1:24:30.664 --> 1:24:33.241
holding hearings on this issue.

1:24:34.439 --> 1:24:36.206
The White House
responded rapidly

1:24:36.208 --> 1:24:38.437
to the board's recommendations.

1:24:38.439 --> 1:24:40.212
Dr. James Killian,

1:24:40.214 --> 1:24:42.050
who had just assumed
his new position

1:24:42.052 --> 1:24:44.147
as special assistant
to the president.

1:24:44.149 --> 1:24:45.679
- And some technology.

1:24:45.681 --> 1:24:47.079
Arranged a meeting

1:24:47.081 --> 1:24:50.816
for the first week of
December among the president,

1:24:50.818 --> 1:24:52.220
the director of
Central Intelligence,

1:24:52.222 --> 1:24:53.393
Mr. Allen Dulles.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:57.628
- It's Nurse
Irwin, there's been an incident.

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:00.334
- What happened?

1:25:00.336 --> 1:25:01.901
- There was
a fire in your office.

1:25:01.903 --> 1:25:02.996
Everything is gone.

1:25:06.568 --> 1:25:08.474
- My files. What about my files?

1:25:08.476 --> 1:25:09.876
- Shelly
escaped from her quarters

1:25:09.878 --> 1:25:11.610
shortly after we left.

1:25:11.612 --> 1:25:15.507
She doused herself in accelerant
before she lit up the room.

1:25:15.509 --> 1:25:16.515
- Oh, fuck.

1:25:18.589 --> 1:25:19.848
No, it wasn't her.

1:25:31.166 --> 1:25:33.926
- Okay.
The moment of truth.

1:25:33.928 --> 1:25:35.594
Will you let us know
when you're through?

1:25:35.596 --> 1:25:37.096
- Yes.
- All right.

1:25:52.919 --> 1:25:53.750
- Shelly?

1:26:00.358 --> 1:26:01.527
Shelly, it's Dr. Strauss.

1:26:07.704 --> 1:26:08.765
Listen to me.

1:26:11.709 --> 1:26:15.068
I know this wasn't you.

1:26:16.878 --> 1:26:18.379
And I am so sorry.

1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:25.452
What?

1:26:28.891 --> 1:26:30.655
- Cameraman.

1:26:38.801 --> 1:26:40.159
- Yeah, cameraman.

1:28:44.453 --> 1:28:45.460
- I'm sorry.

1:33:23.570 --> 1:33:24.536
- And one of those

1:33:24.538 --> 1:33:26.642
who took part in these programs.

1:33:26.644 --> 1:33:29.704
In 1977, the Senate
subcommittee heard testimony

1:33:29.706 --> 1:33:31.007
from many of them,

1:33:31.009 --> 1:33:33.809
but the testimony was
not that revealing.

1:33:33.811 --> 1:33:35.178
According to one of them,

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:37.542
they agreed amongst
themselves to keep the inquiry

1:33:37.544 --> 1:33:40.213
within bounds that would
satisfy the committee.

1:33:40.215 --> 1:33:42.822
Former narcotics
officer Charles Siragusa

1:33:42.824 --> 1:33:45.350
says that he was asked
to limit his testimony

1:33:45.352 --> 1:33:48.056
by the man he reported
to at the CIA.

1:33:48.058 --> 1:33:49.530
- He warned me not
to say anything.

1:33:49.532 --> 1:33:50.428
- To
perjure yourself.

1:33:50.430 --> 1:33:51.260
- That's right.

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:54.434
Well, either that, I'd
have to perjure myself

1:33:54.436 --> 1:33:56.233
or take the fifth amendment.

1:33:56.235 --> 1:33:59.507
and I'm not about to take the
fifth amendment for anybody.

1:33:59.509 --> 1:34:01.766
- Has mind control
been achieved?

1:34:01.768 --> 1:34:05.108
From all of the available
evidence it appears doubtful.

1:34:05.110 --> 1:34:08.377
The human will has
prevailed up to this point.

1:34:08.379 --> 1:34:11.785
But as we have seen, work
is continuing in this field.

1:34:11.787 --> 1:34:14.784
Work that we still don't
know very much about.

1:34:14.786 --> 1:34:16.052
How deeply are the Russians

1:34:16.054 --> 1:34:18.622
and other dictatorships
into all of this?

1:34:18.624 --> 1:34:20.257
We really can't say,

1:34:20.259 --> 1:34:24.156
and the CIA is reluctant to
give out information about it.

1:34:24.158 --> 1:34:25.932
But the basic question remains.

1:34:25.934 --> 1:34:28.836
What place does all of this
have within a democracy?

1:34:29.768 --> 1:34:31.763
One final point should be made.

1:34:31.765 --> 1:34:35.070
As one of the persons who worked
on these programs told us,

1:34:35.072 --> 1:34:36.943
"We have very capable,
conscientious,

1:34:36.945 --> 1:34:40.111
and very dedicated scientists
working for our country.

1:34:41.351 --> 1:34:43.114
Their work speaks for itself."
