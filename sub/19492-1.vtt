IF HE'S GONNA LET ME IN,
MAYBE WE SHOULD PLAY BALL.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.130
SO YOU LIVE HERE?

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.430
NO, NO, NO.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.430
I'VE JUST BEEN SLEEPING
ON THE DOWNSTAIRS COUCH

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.100
SO I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.830
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'D DO
WITHOUT ME TO PROTECT HER.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:56.530
WELL...

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.870
WHERE'S BRITNEY?
IS SHE HERE?

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.510
OH, HERE THEY ARE.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:02.470
HI, MAMA.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.880
I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU, SHUG!

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:10.810
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.180
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.860
SAM SAID YOU WOULDN'T COME.

01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:21.190
I'M ALWAYS HERE
FOR YOU.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:23.290
YOU'RE MY BABY.

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:26.600
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.700
I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:34.140
MAMA...

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:37.210
WHEN DO I GET
TO SEE MY BABIES?

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.040
DO Y'ALL HAVE
PICTURES ON YOUR PHONE?

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.180
YEAH.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.580
[SAM]: DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL SEE THEM SOON.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.950
I'M HELPING HER WITH THAT.

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:48.390
I LOOK OUT
FOR ALL HER INTERESTS.

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:50.590
[LYNNE]: WELL, HER FAMILY
IS HERE FOR HER, TOO.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.820
REALLY?

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.190
WHERE HAS THE FAMILY BEEN
WHEN SHE NEEDED THEM?

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:55.530
I KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.410
TO A MOTHER-DAUGHTER REUNION.

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.750
MAMA...

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.250
I NEED A NEW LIPSTICK.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.150
WILL YOU TAKE ME TO THE STORE?

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.820
YEAH, SURE. LET'S GO!

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.460
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO?

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.200
THE CVS THAT'S JUST
TWO BLOCKS AWAY?

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.130
I GUESS THAT COULD BE OKAY.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.070
YEAH, SURE, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.840
LET'S GO!

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:40.940
OKAY, IT'S ALL CLEAR.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.640
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.140
NO, THAT'S ALRIGHT,
WE CAN MANAGE.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.510
I HAVE THINGS TO DO, TOO,
BUT I ALWAYS PUT BRITNEY FIRST.

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.290
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.090
IF I WEREN'T IN THE HOUSE
WITH BRITNEY,

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.790
WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE WOULD DO?

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.890
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT DOES ANYTHING FOR HER.

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:02.530
NOW SMILE,

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.230

FOR THE HAPPY FAMILY REUNION.

[REPORTERS CLAMORING]

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.480
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET TO SEE MY BABIES?

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:21.810
WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING?

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.250
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.660
I WANT TO SEE DADDY!

ARE YOU OKAY, BABY LOVE?

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.300
YEAH.

COME ON,
BRITNEY.

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.220
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.420
OKAY.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520
WE LOVE YOU.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.520

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:42.890
<i> IT'S LIKE</i>

WE'RE HER PARENTS.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.790
IT SAYS HERE

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:14.890
THAT SHE WAS ADMITTED
FOR BEING A DANGER TO HERSELF.

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.390
SHE WAS DISORIENTED
WHEN SHE CAME IN.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:17.830
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS.

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:25.470
OH, THANK GOD
YOU'RE OKAY, BABY.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.000
MAMA, HI!

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:27.940
WHY AM I AT THE HOSPITAL?

01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:29.010
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:30.040
ME? YOU SHOULD GO!

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.240
I'M THE ONLY ONE
HELPING BRITNEY!

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.340
[BRITNEY]: PLEASE STOP.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.310
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
MEN LIKE YOU?

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.710
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE,
YOU COCKROACH!

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:35.680
YOU SHOULD TALK.

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:37.180
I DON'T WANT ANY YELLING,

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.950
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO GET ALONG, PLEASE!

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:40.720
OKAY.

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:42.450
-SHE DOESN'T WANT THEM HERE!
-I NEED EVERYONE TO LEAVE

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:43.950
SO THAT I CAN
SPEAK WITH HER.

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.330
YOU CAN GO
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.890
COME ON.

01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:57.900
THOSE WERE
YOUR PARENTS?

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.810
AND THE MAN, IS HE A FRIEND?

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.110
I DON'T KNOW.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.640
I'M WONDERING

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.750
IF WE SHOULD LIMIT YOUR VISITORS
TO FAMILY, JUST FOR NOW.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.620
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:13.420
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO BE?

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.190
NOWHERE.

01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:18.160
NOBODY HEARS ME, YOU KNOW?

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.990
NOBODY LISTENS
TO ANYTHING I SAY.

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:26.160
EVERYONE SPEAKS FOR ME,
BUT I'M A PERSON, YOU KNOW?

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:29.670
I DO, AND I'M LISTENING.

01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:32.600
AND I WANT
TO HELP YOU,

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.670
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE
OPEN TO IT,

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:35.310
AND THAT MEANS BEING HERE
A LITTLE WHILE

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.240
AND PARTICIPATING,

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:38.210
MAYBE TRYING NEW MEDS.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:42.810
I JUST WANT TO BE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.950
LIKE AN ISLAND OR SOMETHING,

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.180
WHERE NOBODY KNOWS ME,

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.750
AND I CAN JUST SPEND TIME
WITH MY BOYS.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.120
THAT SOUNDS NICE,

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.060
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD JUST GIVE

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.290
BEING HERE AT THE HOSPITAL
A TRY.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.790
IT WOULD BE A BREAK
FROM ALL THE PRESSURE.

01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:02.100
DON'T YOU WANT A BREAK?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.030
I WANT TO BE STRONG.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.070
YOU WILL BE.

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.940
LET US HELP YOU.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.020
HEY, SAM LUTFI,

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.320
IT'S ME, MANI.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.290
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.220
NO. NO, I DON'T.
DO I KNOW YOU?

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.450
NO.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.390
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.030
READ IT.
IT'S A RESTRAINING ORDER.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.170
BRITNEY, YOUR FAMILY HAS FILED

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.240
TO MAKE YOUR FATHER
YOUR CONSERVATOR.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:42.110
THEY WILL APPEAR BEFORE A JUDGE,

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.610
AND ASK THAT HE BE APPOINTED.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.680
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.310
IT MEANS THAT YOUR FATHER

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.050
WOULD HELP MAKE DECISIONS
FOR YOU ON YOUR BEHALF.

01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:56.720
HEALTH CARE DECISIONS,
FINANCES, FAMILY?

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:57.650
IS THAT TRUE?

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.060
YOU CAN'T DO THAT?

01:18:00.190 --> 01:18:02.460
WHY DO YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME?

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.590
EVERYONE WANTS TO CONTROL ME.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.560
HONEY, IT'S TEMPORARY,

01:18:06.670 --> 01:18:07.930
AND IT'S JUST A WAY
THAT WE CAN HELP YOU.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.830
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.070
HONEY, WE KNOW
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON,

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.840
AND YOU'RE SO, SO SPECIAL.

01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:18.580
YOU'RE TALENTED,
AND YOU'RE SMART...

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:21.110
BUT THERE ARE
BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.410
WHO'VE BEEN HURTING YOU,

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.780
AND THIS IS A WAY
WE CAN STOP THEM

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.520
AND HELP YOU
WHEN YOU NEED US.

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.250
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT THIS?

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.320
BRITNEY, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.190
TO HAVE YOUR OWN ATTORNEY
PRESENT,

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.260
BUT, FOR NOW,

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:36.190
I THINK IT WOULD BE
EASIER ON YOU

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.360
IF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
FIND A WAY TO WORK THIS OUT.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.440
Y'ALL WANT MY MONEY, DON'T YOU?

01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:50.170
BABY, NO.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.780
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:55.150
IT'S ABOUT THOSE WONDERFUL
LITTLE BABIES OF YOURS.

01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:59.350
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO
TO HELP YOU GET THEM BACK.

01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:01.350
SHOW THE COURT THAT YOU'VE GOT
THE SUPPORT OF A GOOD FAMILY.

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:04.520
GOOD FAMILY?

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.420
YOU WERE ALWAYS DRUNK.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.460
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.930
GOD KNOWS I'M NOT PERFECT.

01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:15.230
I LOST EVERYTHING TO MY DEMONS.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.300
YOU, YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SISTER,
YOUR MAMA...

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.670
TIME WITH MY FAMILY.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.340
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:27.980
BUT I HATE TO SEE YOU IN PAIN.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.980
WE JUST WANT TO PROTECT YOU.

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:34.220
YOU'RE OUR LITTLE GIRL.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.860
IT'S TOO LATE.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.760
NO IT'S NOT.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.930
WE'RE A FAMILY,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.560
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER,

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.100
AND WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:51.470
LET US HELP YOU, PLEASE?

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:54.370
I'M BEGGIN' YOU.

01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:56.210
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:26.200
I JUST WANT MY LIFE BACK.

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:30.640
WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU, SHUG.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.580
WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU BETTER,

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.210
AND THEN
WE'LL CALL UP LARRY, OKAY?

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.390
OKAY.

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:47.690
OKAY.

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:55.700
<i> SOME DAYS, IT'S GREAT,</i>

01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:57.700
<i> BUT OTHER DAYS,</i>
<i> IT'S REALLY HARD.</i>

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.700
<i> I DO WANT MORE FREEDOM,</i>

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.340

<i> A CAR CRASH</i>

<i> AND IT'S LIKE...</i>

<i> EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD</i>
<i> JUST KIND OF STOPPED?</i>

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.250
