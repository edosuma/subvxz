10:23.259 --> 10:23.400
<i>that were also white and male.</i>

10:24.467 --> 10:25.700
So at the same time,

10:25.767 --> 10:28.467
you had others that didn't
quite fit into that mold,

10:28.467 --> 10:33.467
like Ed Dwight,
he was an African-American
jet fighter pilot.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.667
[narrator] <i>At the time,</i>
<i>NASA's culture</i>
<i>of favored white men</i>

10:36.667 --> 10:37.867
<i>and its strict requirements,</i>

10:37.867 --> 10:39.667
<i>including</i>
<i>test pilot experience,</i>

10:39.667 --> 10:41.367
<i>made women ineligible.</i>

10:41.367 --> 10:46.967
<i>But Captain Edward Dwight Jr,</i>
<i>a hotshot pilot, fit the bill.</i>

10:46.967 --> 10:52.000
John Kennedy really wanted
to have diversity
in the astronaut program,

10:52.066 --> 10:53.259
and so he directed
the Air Force

10:53.259 --> 10:54.700
and so he directed
the Air Force

10:54.767 --> 10:56.367
to find somebody who...

10:56.367 --> 11:00.100
who was qualified
that they could
put into the space program.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.467
I was a novelty
because everywhere I went,

11:04.467 --> 11:06.667
I was the only Black
in the Air Force.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.367
<i>I took to flying just like</i>
<i>a duck to water.</i>

11:09.367 --> 11:11.567
I managed to do well
to what I did.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.367
<i>And then I was flying</i>
<i>fighter airplanes</i>

11:13.367 --> 11:16.567
and I was working
on my masters
in nuclear engineering.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.467
[chuckles]

11:18.467 --> 11:23.100
Doing really, really well,
and I was on fast track
and it was just wonderful.

11:24.367 --> 11:27.567
At the time,
you had to be a test pilot

11:27.567 --> 11:29.166
before you become
an astronaut.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.367
I sent my credentials in.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.166
Four days later,
I got a letter back,

11:34.166 --> 11:36.300
sending me to
Edwards Air Force Base

11:36.367 --> 11:38.300
to go to the Experimental
Test Pilot School,

11:39.600 --> 11:41.767
to go down there
and get interviewed
by Chuck Yeager.

11:44.300 --> 11:48.166
Unfortunately, Ed was caught
into the politics
of everything.

11:50.266 --> 11:53.259
The test pilot school
wasn't in on the deal.

11:53.259 --> 11:53.367
The test pilot school
wasn't in on the deal.

11:53.367 --> 11:56.867
They didn't have any control
of my coming in

11:56.867 --> 12:00.567
and having Washington,
DC appoint somebody
that test pilot school

12:00.567 --> 12:04.700
does not fit into that mold,
because they're Superman.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.000
And so therefore,
if a Black guy can do it,

12:07.066 --> 12:08.767
uh, then they're not Superman.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.600
Ed Dwight
kind of ran into a buzz saw

12:14.667 --> 12:16.767
<i>in the form of some</i>
<i>of the hierarchy</i>

12:16.767 --> 12:18.166
<i>at the Test Pilot School,</i>

12:18.166 --> 12:21.100
who just did not like
the idea of...

12:21.100 --> 12:23.200
of a Black coming
from the Air Force

12:23.266 --> 12:25.100
<i>and going into NASA</i>
<i>in the space program.</i>

12:26.800 --> 12:28.367
[Ed] <i>Prior to my coming there,</i>

12:28.367 --> 12:31.266
<i>Chuck Yeager called</i>
<i>everybody in to say,</i>

12:31.266 --> 12:34.967
"You know that Washington
is trying to cram the N-word

12:34.967 --> 12:38.600
down our throats
and we don't want him
to graduate."

12:41.266 --> 12:43.600
So it was hell
in the very, very beginning.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.767
<i>And I had to fight that,</i>
<i>you know, the best I could.</i>

12:48.900 --> 12:52.066
<i>I was very, very hopeful,</i>
<i>very, very confident.</i>

12:52.066 --> 12:53.259
<i>I had been doing a good job.</i>

12:53.259 --> 12:53.600
<i>I had been doing a good job.</i>

12:53.667 --> 12:55.767
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>I kept my nose clean</i>

12:55.767 --> 12:58.600
<i>because I was anticipating</i>
<i>being selected.</i>

13:02.300 --> 13:06.867
[Deke] I'd like to introduce
the new group of 14 astronauts

13:06.867 --> 13:08.567
that we've been
in the process of selecting

13:08.567 --> 13:11.367
for about the last
four months.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.000
[Reporter]
<i>Was there a Negro boy</i>
<i>in the last 30 or so</i>

13:14.066 --> 13:16.967
<i>that you brought here,</i>
<i>for consideration?</i>

13:16.967 --> 13:18.266
No, there was not.

13:22.867 --> 13:23.259
[photographer] <i>Hey, gentlemen,</i>

13:23.259 --> 13:24.600
[photographer] <i>Hey, gentlemen,</i>
<i>look over here, please.</i>

13:24.667 --> 13:26.166
That's it.

13:26.166 --> 13:30.000
[narrator]
<i>In a stunning development,</i>
<i>NASA did not select Dwight.</i>

13:30.066 --> 13:31.667
[reporter speaking]

13:34.500 --> 13:36.700
No, I would rather
not comment on that.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.567
[narrator] <i>It would take</i>
<i>nearly 20 years</i>

13:38.567 --> 13:41.367
<i>before the organization</i>
<i>would select</i>
<i>an astronaut class</i>

13:41.367 --> 13:44.800
<i>that did not consist</i>
<i>entirely of white men.</i>

13:44.867 --> 13:46.867
The people who decide
who has talent,

13:46.867 --> 13:47.967
who are we going to let in,

13:47.967 --> 13:49.667
who are we going to give
an opportunity.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.100
<i>People look for people</i>
<i>that are similar</i>
<i>to themselves.</i>

13:53.100 --> 13:53.259
That's what makes them
comfortable.

13:53.259 --> 13:54.667
That's what makes them
comfortable.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.500
Another example
of discrimination

13:57.567 --> 14:00.467
was Mary Wallace Funk,
who goes by Wally.

14:00.467 --> 14:04.367
<i>And she was an incredibly</i>
<i>accomplished pilot,</i>
<i>taught other pilots.</i>

14:04.367 --> 14:06.367
<i>She was actually</i>
<i>one of 13 women</i>

14:06.367 --> 14:08.467
<i>who, in the early 1960s,</i>

14:08.467 --> 14:13.266
<i>actually underwent</i>
<i>the same physical examinations</i>
<i>as the Mercury Seven.</i>

14:13.266 --> 14:17.100
<i>And she was also excluded</i>
<i>from the Astronaut Corps</i>
<i>because at the time,</i>

14:17.166 --> 14:20.467
<i>while NASA didn't specifically</i>
<i>exclude women,</i>

14:20.467 --> 14:23.259
<i>to be an astronaut,</i>
<i>you needed 1,500 hours</i>
<i>of jet fighter training.</i>

14:23.259 --> 14:24.400
<i>to be an astronaut,</i>
<i>you needed 1,500 hours</i>
<i>of jet fighter training.</i>

14:24.467 --> 14:26.467
And of course, women
were not allowed in combat,

14:26.467 --> 14:28.567
so women were not allowed
to get that training.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.667
So it was a sort
of backdoor way

14:30.667 --> 14:33.667
that NASA could keep women
out of the Astronaut Corps.

14:33.667 --> 14:37.467
NASA did miss
its opportunities early on

14:37.467 --> 14:41.166
to send women
and African-Americans
into space.

14:41.166 --> 14:44.867
Russia sent
the first woman into space,
Valentina Tereshkova.

14:44.867 --> 14:47.967
They sent the first
nonwhite person into space,

14:47.967 --> 14:50.266
a Black man from Cuba.

14:50.266 --> 14:53.259
It took NASA a long time
to follow suit.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.100
It took NASA a long time
to follow suit.

14:54.100 --> 14:58.500
That is simply a stain
that NASA has to carry.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.000
[narrator]
<i>As the space race heated up,</i>

15:02.000 --> 15:05.567
<i>NASA was not focused</i>
<i>on diversifying</i>
<i>the Astronaut Corps.</i>

15:05.567 --> 15:08.767
<i>Its goal</i>
<i>was on the ultimate prize,</i>
<i>the Moon.</i>

15:12.100 --> 15:14.000
But why, some say, the Moon?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.767
Why choose this as our goal?

15:16.767 --> 15:19.266
[narrator]
<i>In a 1962 speech in Texas,</i>

15:19.266 --> 15:22.867
<i>President John F. Kennedy</i>
<i>set out America's</i>
<i>ambitious goals</i>

15:22.867 --> 15:25.400
<i>to beat its Soviet rivals.</i>

15:25.467 --> 15:28.266
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

15:28.266 --> 15:31.700
and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

15:31.767 --> 15:33.600
but because they are hard.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.400
[narrator]
<i>American fervor for space</i>
<i>reached untold heights</i>

15:36.467 --> 15:39.266
<i>in the 1960s,</i>
<i>with NASA's new directive</i>

15:39.266 --> 15:40.509
<i>to get to the Moon</i>
<i>at any cost.</i>

15:40.509 --> 15:42.266
<i>to get to the Moon</i>
<i>at any cost.</i>

15:42.266 --> 15:45.300
<i>In 2020, that same excitement</i>
<i>was rekindled</i>

15:45.367 --> 15:50.000

on American rockets
from American soil.

15:55.266 --> 15:57.367
[applause]

15:57.367 --> 16:04.400
2020 really mirrors 1968
when you look at the balance
between NASA activities

16:04.467 --> 16:07.767
<i>and space activities</i>
<i>and a great deal of unrest</i>

16:07.767 --> 16:10.166
<i>here on Earth</i>
<i>occurring simultaneously.</i>

16:12.500 --> 16:14.600
[Roland] In the late 1960s,

16:14.667 --> 16:19.200
America was so much
more racist

16:19.266 --> 16:20.700
and it was open.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.500
It was visceral.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.667
[narrator]
<i>The civil rights movement</i>

16:23.667 --> 16:25.900
<i>confronted the nation's</i>
<i>overt racism,</i>

16:25.967 --> 16:27.967
<i>including segregated</i>
<i>facilities,</i>

16:27.967 --> 16:31.867
<i>police violence,</i>
<i>and unrelenting</i>
<i>racial hostilities.</i>

16:31.867 --> 16:34.967
There was violence,
the use of fire hoses,

16:34.967 --> 16:37.667
<i>and dogs against</i>
<i>peaceful protesters.</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:40.509
<i>There was the draft</i>

16:40.509 --> 16:41.767
<i>There was the draft</i>
<i>for the Vietnam War,</i>

16:41.767 --> 16:45.266
<i>and a disproportionate</i>
<i>number of Blacks</i>
<i>were being drafted.</i>

16:47.367 --> 16:49.567
The Chicago Democratic
Convention

16:49.567 --> 16:55.000
was a great convergence
of social justice movements,

16:55.066 --> 16:56.800
opposition to Vietnam.

16:58.467 --> 17:03.000
I was at the Democratic
National Convention
in Chicago.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.467
<i>So when you mentioned</i>
<i>the '68 Convention,</i>

17:05.467 --> 17:07.066
<i>you pull a scab off of me</i>

17:07.066 --> 17:10.509
because I have scars
that include my first whiff
of tear gas.

17:10.509 --> 17:12.667
because I have scars

Senator Gene McCarthy

17:22.467 --> 17:25.300

Ralph Yarborough

17:27.000 --> 17:30.100
<i>in about a fifth floor window</i>

17:32.667 --> 17:37.266
<i>And the riot that was created</i>
<i>was not created by protesters,</i>

17:38.300 --> 17:40.000
it was created by the police.

[Harry] A l <i>ater official</i>
<i>exhaustive investigation</i>

17:44.166 --> 17:46.166

17:47.700 --> 17:49.667
[Curtis]
After we closed the window,

17:49.667 --> 17:54.266
the three of us
sat in the room and cried

17:54.266 --> 17:59.266
because what was happening
to our nation was...
was just shocking.

17:59.266 --> 18:01.166
[protesters shouting]

18:01.166 --> 18:03.266
[narrator] <i>These now iconic</i>
<i>and bloody images</i>

18:03.266 --> 18:07.467

18:13.767 --> 18:16.166
Sunlight

18:16.166 --> 18:18.166
In our civil rights era
of the '60s,

18:18.166 --> 18:20.600
the disruptive technology
was the news cameras

18:20.667 --> 18:21.900
right there on the street.

18:21.967 --> 18:25.066
Today,
the disruptive technology
is the cell phone.

18:25.066 --> 18:27.066
When people see the injustice,

18:27.066 --> 18:28.767
now they can speak out
against it.

18:28.767 --> 18:32.166
And I'm a true believer
that were it not for cameras

18:32.166 --> 18:35.900
in the civil rights era,
things would have
turned out differently.

Martin Luther King was...

"Turn the television on

Dr. King."

19:27.000 --> 19:28.567
And I dropped the phone.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.767
I was literally in shock.

19:31.967 --> 19:37.100
I was crushed when Dr. King
was assassinated.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.367

I've had.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.867
<i>Things seemed to be going</i>

20:00.867 --> 20:02.266
Seems like as always,

20:02.266 --> 20:05.200
make progress and then
we go backwards.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.467
Pretty bleak time
for you to believe

20:10.467 --> 20:10.509
that this country was a place

20:10.509 --> 20:13.367
that this country was a place

20:13.367 --> 20:17.967
where we were going to
be able to subsist peacefully

20:17.967 --> 20:20.367
alongside our white brothers
and sisters.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.367
This is a difficult time
for the United States.

20:24.367 --> 20:27.700
It's perhaps well to ask
what kind of a nation we are.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.667
[Charles] Robert Kennedy
was a person to whom

20:30.667 --> 20:35.300
we all looked
because he was the successor

20:35.367 --> 20:37.500
of his brother,
President John Kennedy,

20:37.567 --> 20:39.266
and then he was assassinated.

20:41.867 --> 20:47.367
[Charles] <i>At that time,</i>
<i>we lost two iconic figures</i>
<i>in the Black community.</i>

20:47.367 --> 20:48.967
It was just unspeakable.

20:48.967 --> 20:51.567
And it was all on television.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.767
<i>We were all in mourning,</i>

20:53.767 --> 20:55.867

20:57.367 --> 20:58.500
[Carl] What do you do?

20:58.567 --> 20:59.667
You're killing everyone.

20:59.667 --> 21:00.767
Everyone.

21:00.767 --> 21:03.000
All of our leaders.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.200

<i>to put a man on the Moon,</i>

21:42.066 --> 21:45.467
we can spend
billions of dollars
to put God's children

right here on Earth.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.367
[crowd cheering]

21:51.000 --> 21:52.667
Back in the '60s,

21:52.667 --> 21:52.948
many of the grassroots
political movements

21:52.948 --> 21:54.500
many of the grassroots
political movements

21:54.567 --> 21:59.400
had a common adversary
in the space race
and in NASA in particular.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.767
And they could say
that that money and effort

22:01.767 --> 22:03.667
and even, you know,
cultural capital

22:03.667 --> 22:06.000
<i>could be much better spent</i>
<i>back here on Earth,</i>

22:06.066 --> 22:09.300

<i>to stop the war in Vietnam,</i>
<i>for instance.</i>

22:11.367 --> 22:14.300
And I think
that's a little bit
what's happening today.

22:14.367 --> 22:19.867
<i>We have this incredible moment</i>
<i>where private space companies</i>
<i>are blasting off to orbit.</i>

22:19.867 --> 22:21.567
<i>They're planning on going</i>
<i>to the Moon.</i>

22:21.567 --> 22:22.948
<i>It's really pretty exciting.</i>

22:22.948 --> 22:23.166
<i>It's really pretty exciting.</i>

22:23.166 --> 22:24.767
<i>But at the same moment,</i>
<i>on the streets,</i>

22:24.767 --> 22:26.000
<i>we have people</i>
<i>who are really upset</i>

22:26.066 --> 22:28.867
<i>with what's going on back down</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

22:28.867 --> 22:31.567
And this is exactly
what was happening
in the '60s.

22:33.100 --> 22:36.166
[Curtis]
When Dr. King was tragically
taken away from us,

22:36.166 --> 22:39.400
fortunately, he had a man
standing in the wings.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.667
<i>Ralph David Abernathy</i>
<i>took up the banner</i>

22:41.667 --> 22:44.100
of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference

22:44.100 --> 22:46.567
to continue the work
that Dr. King had started.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.767
So on the eve
of the Apollo 11 launch,

22:49.767 --> 22:52.800
Ralph Abernathy arrives
at the Kennedy Space Center

22:52.867 --> 22:52.948
with 25 poor
African-American families,

22:52.948 --> 22:55.367
with 25 poor
African-American families,

22:56.867 --> 22:59.000
four mules,
and two rickety wagons.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.500
There's press there.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.767
There's newscasters
and reporters.

23:02.767 --> 23:07.367
We are here to protest
and we are here
to demonstrate.

23:07.367 --> 23:11.667
We are here to say
that what we can do for space

23:11.667 --> 23:15.266
and exploration, we must do,

23:15.266 --> 23:18.000
and we demand that we do,

23:18.066 --> 23:21.400
the very same
for starving poor people.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.948
-Yes!
-Yeah!

23:22.948 --> 23:23.200
-Yes!
-Yeah!

23:23.266 --> 23:26.200
Abernathy had the power
of the press behind him.

23:26.266 --> 23:29.166
They were attentive
to Abernathy's activities.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.767
It compelled the NASA
administrator

23:31.767 --> 23:36.567
to come and speak to him
in public on camera.

23:36.567 --> 23:39.767
If it were possible for us
tomorrow morning

23:39.767 --> 23:41.400
to not push the button

23:41.467 --> 23:44.767
and to solve the problems
to which you are concerned,

23:44.767 --> 23:47.700
believe me,
we would not push the button.

23:47.767 --> 23:50.600
The response of the NASA
administrator, which I...

23:50.667 --> 23:52.100
I have to compliment,
was, you know,

23:52.166 --> 23:52.948
"If I could stop
this launch tomorrow
and correct every ill,

23:52.948 --> 23:56.700
"If I could stop
this launch tomorrow
and correct every ill,

23:56.767 --> 23:57.900
I would do that.

23:57.967 --> 23:59.266
But I can't."

23:59.266 --> 24:02.667
And it would do no good
and it would keep us
from advancing.

24:02.667 --> 24:07.100
And I think
what I'm trying to say here
is it is not an either, or.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.000
<i>We have leadership</i>
<i>in this country today</i>
<i>that believes,</i>

24:10.000 --> 24:11.467
<i>"I win, you lose."</i>

24:11.467 --> 24:12.600
<i>That's not the world.</i>

24:12.667 --> 24:14.000
<i>The world is very nuanced.</i>

24:16.300 --> 24:20.166
Unfortunately,
it falls upon us,

24:20.166 --> 24:21.967
the oppressed group,

24:21.967 --> 24:22.948
to educate the group that's
supposed to be damn smart.

24:22.948 --> 24:24.800
to educate the group that's
supposed to be damn smart.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.567
[Hakeem]
<i>So if you want to say,</i>

24:27.567 --> 24:29.367
<i>"Oh, look at the money</i>
<i>that they put here.</i>

24:29.367 --> 24:31.000
<i>Could we have put it</i>
<i>somewhere else?"</i>

24:31.000 --> 24:32.800
Well, money doesn't work
like that, right?

24:32.867 --> 24:35.667
Money isn't a zero-sum game.

24:35.667 --> 24:36.867
I was in the federal
government

24:36.867 --> 24:38.266
and I used to press
the button,

24:38.266 --> 24:40.166
"Time to send $10 million."

24:40.166 --> 24:41.600
Everything that happens

24:41.667 --> 24:44.000
is a matter of will
and choice.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
So if you want to give
a billion dollars
to some good cause,

24:48.066 --> 24:49.166
<i>the money is there.</i>

24:49.166 --> 24:50.800
<i>You have to make it a priority</i>

24:50.867 --> 24:52.948
<i>and you have to do it</i>
<i>by design.</i>

24:52.948 --> 24:53.600
<i>and you have to do it</i>
<i>by design.</i>

24:55.066 --> 24:59.266
I pray that the astronauts
will have a safe flight

24:59.266 --> 25:03.100
and a safe return
to this Earth.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.066
[announcer]
<i>Thirty seconds and counting.</i>

25:05.066 --> 25:07.467
<i>We are still go</i>
<i>with Apollo 11.</i>

25:09.367 --> 25:10.667
The people
who came with Abernathy,

25:10.667 --> 25:12.000
including Abernathy himself,

25:12.066 --> 25:14.900
are really excited
and they go to the launch.

25:14.967 --> 25:18.667
[announcer] <i>12, 11, 10, 9.</i>

25:28.467 --> 25:29.767
<i>We have a liftoff!</i>

25:29.767 --> 25:31.400
[triumphant music playing]

25:40.667 --> 25:43.066
[Curtis] Abernathy's
demonstration was eclipsed

25:43.066 --> 25:45.967
by the significance of that

25:45.967 --> 25:48.667
technological movement
at the time.

25:49.667 --> 25:51.166
[astronaut speaking]

25:54.767 --> 25:57.100
But on the other hand,
the nation needed

25:57.166 --> 25:59.400
to think about the fact
that people

25:59.467 --> 26:01.166
were starving to death.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.867
And the nation still needs
to think about people

26:03.867 --> 26:05.166
that are starving to death.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.667
<i>We still need to do something</i>
<i>in those places</i>

26:09.667 --> 26:12.767
<i>where it looks like the 1800s,</i>

26:12.767 --> 26:14.700
<i>where raw sewage</i>
<i>is still running</i>

26:14.767 --> 26:16.500
<i>from the back of the house.</i>

26:16.567 --> 26:20.266
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>we're doing all of these</i>
<i>things technologically.</i>

26:20.266 --> 26:22.948
<i>Would you believe</i>
<i>we're living with that today</i>

26:22.948 --> 26:23.066
<i>Would you believe</i>
<i>we're living with that today</i>

26:23.066 --> 26:24.900
<i>and nobody has done</i>
<i>anything about it?</i>

26:26.100 --> 26:28.667
When you think back
to the 1960s,

26:28.667 --> 26:31.367
<i>it was a very,</i>
<i>very challenging time.</i>

26:31.367 --> 26:33.600
<i>And yet we had this</i>
<i>one moment in time</i>

26:33.667 --> 26:36.166
<i>when we had</i>
<i>American astronauts</i>

26:36.166 --> 26:39.700
leaving the Earth eventually
to go step on another world

26:39.767 --> 26:41.800
for the first time
in human history.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.166
<i>The world stopped</i>
<i>and they were looking</i>

26:44.166 --> 26:47.467
<i>at this amazing human</i>
<i>achievement for...</i>

26:47.467 --> 26:50.500
<i>for just these few moments</i>
<i>in time.</i>

26:50.567 --> 26:52.700
Now, if we fast forward
to today,

26:52.767 --> 26:52.948
<i>we've had challenges.</i>

26:52.948 --> 26:54.100
<i>we've had challenges.</i>

26:54.100 --> 26:57.400
<i>And yet when we launched</i>
<i>Demo-2,</i>

26:57.467 --> 27:00.367
<i>again, every news station</i>
<i>broke in</i>

27:00.367 --> 27:02.166
<i>and wanted to cover it</i>
<i>because again,</i>

27:02.166 --> 27:04.166
<i>it was a human achievement,</i>

27:04.166 --> 27:09.567
just like the Apollo 11 moment
on July 20th, 1969.

[Neil Armstrong]
Tranquility base here.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.367

<i>Wally says, "I'm speechless."</i>

27:25.567 --> 27:30.967
[Neil Armstrong]
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

27:30.967 --> 27:32.066
[Neil] I mean, in some ways,

27:32.066 --> 27:34.667
it was very, very positive
for us as a nation.

27:34.667 --> 27:37.000
But I think, in other ways,
it's both good and bad.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.867
There were reports of people
in Harlem

27:38.867 --> 27:40.600
who were watching
baseball games

27:40.667 --> 27:42.767
at that time instead
of watching the Moon landing,

27:42.767 --> 27:45.867
because they just didn't feel
included in that endeavor.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.266
The thing about these
space science
fiction programs

28:30.266 --> 28:33.800
is that they illustrate
our aspirations as a society.

28:33.867 --> 28:36.667
And one element
of these programs quite often

28:36.667 --> 28:38.066
is how inclusive they are.

in real life.

28:48.467 --> 28:50.166
That cast was so diverse.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.000
When Star Trek
came on in 1966,

28:55.066 --> 28:56.367

going to places
where few have gone before.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.667
[Sonequa] <i>We had</i>
<i>Nichelle Nichols playing</i>
<i>Lieutenant Uhura.</i>

29:22.667 --> 29:24.500

29:24.567 --> 29:26.166
being a genius herself,

29:26.166 --> 29:29.000
uh, and seeing that,
that was the first time

29:29.066 --> 29:31.400
we saw a Black woman
in that way.

29:33.200 --> 29:37.500
Nichelle Nichols was the first
African-American woman
on television

29:37.567 --> 29:39.266

There is a little, um,
similarity between
Star Trek and me.

29:45.166 --> 29:49.166
So, Lieutenant Uhura
was the communications officer

29:49.166 --> 29:52.100
<i>and I was the communications</i>
<i>person on my mission.</i>

and designed to put us
in the business of space.

30:30.467 --> 30:34.000
Nichelle Nichols was appointed
to the board of directors,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.066
uh, of the National
Space Institute in 1977.

30:38.467 --> 30:39.821
<i>She was responsible for this</i>

30:39.821 --> 30:42.100
<i>She was responsible for this</i>
<i>recruitment campaign</i>

30:42.100 --> 30:45.400
<i>because she said,</i>
<i>"Where are the women?</i>

30:45.467 --> 30:47.166
<i>Where are the Black people</i>

30:47.166 --> 30:49.567

I have met Black scientists
that have chosen that
because of Star Trek.

31:04.066 --> 31:06.867
She took that public platform
that she had,

31:06.867 --> 31:09.200
and so she was responsible
for bringing in like

31:09.266 --> 31:09.821
8,000 plus applicants,

31:09.821 --> 31:11.400
8,000 plus applicants,

31:11.467 --> 31:16.300
<i>and it led to 35 new</i>
<i>astronauts being chosen.</i>

31:16.367 --> 31:22.266
That group was the first group
that included women
and minorities in NASA.

[narrator] <i>Nichelle Nichols'</i>
<i>pioneering role</i>

31:27.567 --> 31:30.867

33:06.767 --> 33:09.400
[Ahmed] Being Jar Jar

33:09.467 --> 33:09.821

I said, "Oh, man, my brother,

35:29.767 --> 35:35.600
And then they announced
the name Dr. Ronald McNair.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.100
And from that point,
I heard nothing else.

35:40.066 --> 35:41.400
It was almost impossible.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.166
How was this that a guy

South Carolina,

35:45.166 --> 35:48.000
<i>by far not your image</i>

35:50.500 --> 35:56.100
The class of '78
included an Asian man,
three Black men,

37:02.266 --> 37:04.000

37:04.066 --> 37:07.500
I was very fortunate
because Sally flew on STS-7

so I flew right behind Sally.

37:11.066 --> 37:13.300

all the media attention

that I was going to get
the same thing.

41:00.367 --> 41:04.166
<i>provided a beacon of hope</i>
<i>for the next generation.</i>

41:04.166 --> 41:09.600
My brother became a part
of the space program
before Charles Bolden.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.600
[Charles] <i>I was a test pilot</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

41:11.667 --> 41:15.367
<i>Dr. Ron McNair</i>

41:15.367 --> 41:17.567
<i>He said, "Hey, are you going</i>

41:17.567 --> 41:18.900
I said, "Ron,
not on your life."

41:18.967 --> 41:19.654
And he looked at me
incredulously.

41:19.654 --> 41:21.667
And he looked at me
incredulously.

41:21.667 --> 41:22.767
He said, "Why not?"

41:22.767 --> 41:24.867
I said, "Ron,
they'd never pick me."

41:24.867 --> 41:27.800
He said, "You know,
how do you know
if you don't ask?"

41:29.100 --> 41:33.367
He was accepted
in the cohort of 1980.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.200
[Charles]
<i>When I got to Houston</i>
<i>in the summer of 1980,</i>

41:40.266 --> 41:42.100
<i>I wasn't ready</i>
<i>for the reception</i>

41:42.100 --> 41:45.500
that we would get
in the broader
Houston community.

41:45.567 --> 41:49.467
I remember I had to go
to a neighboring city
called Pasadena.

41:49.467 --> 41:49.654
And so I remember driving.

41:49.654 --> 41:51.000
And so I remember driving.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.266
And as I'm crossing
the city limit,

41:53.266 --> 41:55.867
there's this big billboard
with a guy

41:55.867 --> 41:58.467
on a white horse
reared up in a...

41:58.467 --> 41:59.567
and a hood.

41:59.567 --> 42:01.166
And it said,
"Welcome to Pasadena,

42:01.166 --> 42:02.467
home of the Ku Klux Klan."

42:03.900 --> 42:06.166
I just kind of went,
"You got to be [bleep] me."

42:06.166 --> 42:10.667
Excuse my French.
I said, "This is 1980.

42:10.667 --> 42:14.100
Uh, I know I'm not going
to have to go through
this stuff again."

42:14.166 --> 42:15.634

43:56.367 --> 43:59.266
[narrator]
<i>The Challenger explosion</i>

44:10.867 --> 44:12.367
I think all of us
in the astronaut office

44:12.367 --> 44:13.700
went through
some soul searching,

44:13.700 --> 44:17.767

what we wanted to do.

it took me a nanosecond

44:21.000 --> 44:24.400
to make up my mind that
this is where I belong.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.467
<i>I felt that</i>

44:35.166 --> 44:36.433
they will never pick me.

44:37.867 --> 44:40.600
I think,
if you talk to a lot of us
in the space program,

44:40.667 --> 44:43.100
particularly the Blacks,
we all say, you know,

44:43.100 --> 44:45.300

44:59.467 --> 45:02.066
I was in awe

especially
the African-American
astronauts,

45:04.467 --> 45:06.066
which at the time there were,

45:06.066 --> 45:07.300
you know, a handful of.

45:10.166 --> 45:13.867
In 1987, Mae Jemison
was picked
for the Astronaut Corps,

45:13.867 --> 45:16.367
and I was very inspired
by her.

45:20.300 --> 45:24.100
[narrator] Dr. Mae Jemison
became the first Black woman
to travel to space.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.100
[Hakeem]
When you look at the year
Mae Jemison went up,

45:28.166 --> 45:32.100
in 1992, that was also
the year of the LA riots

45:32.166 --> 45:34.500

Rodney King event.

45:56.767 --> 45:59.100

[narrator] <i>The debate about</i>

Sometimes, when we send up
an African-American

46:26.367 --> 46:30.367
there are issues in America
that are racial.

46:31.567 --> 46:33.367

the same old thing.

46:57.300 --> 46:59.767
For most Black people
who are not Victor Glover,

46:59.767 --> 47:03.467
our feet were never more
firmly planted on the ground.

47:03.467 --> 47:07.567
<i>There was no escaping</i>
<i>the reality under</i>

47:07.567 --> 47:11.000

What did they say?

47:27.367 --> 47:29.800
"There's no justice.
It's just us."

47:29.867 --> 47:33.367
Right?
It's just us out there.

the time that I aired

1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:07.600
the Ahmaud Arbery video,
and I actually showed
him being shot by...

1:04:07.667 --> 1:04:11.734
by the shotgun,
in the abdomen.

1:04:11.734 --> 1:04:13.266

I jog through neighborhoods
that are white.

1:04:40.266 --> 1:04:44.900
Because he's jogging,
he's not bothering anyone
on his daily run,

1:04:44.967 --> 1:04:48.300
so I never worried about him
jogging, ever.

1:04:48.367 --> 1:04:49.519

George Floyd happened

1:04:49.519 --> 1:04:50.600
And then all of a sudden,
George Floyd happened

1:04:50.667 --> 1:04:52.567

Ahmaud Arbery.

1:04:52.567 --> 1:04:56.367

Ahmaud Arbery enough,

George Floyd.

1:16:42.567 --> 1:16:43.900
It needs to be changed.

1:16:45.967 --> 1:16:49.567
[narrator]
<i>With battle lines drawn,</i>
<i>can a nation heal?</i>

1:16:49.567 --> 1:16:50.259

1:16:56.834 --> 1:16:58.166
George Floyd!

1:17:00.066 --> 1:17:02.834
Initially,
the city of Minneapolis

1:17:02.834 --> 1:17:04.266
released statements saying

1:17:04.266 --> 1:17:07.367
that George Floyd died
of medical complications,

1:17:07.367 --> 1:17:10.500
<i>until it was exposed.</i>

1:17:10.567 --> 1:17:12.066
<i>What happened?</i>

1:17:12.066 --> 1:17:15.000
The city of Minneapolis
was prepared to lie.

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.500
Did lie.

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:21.200
The entire system is really
responsible for the murder
of George Floyd.

1:17:21.266 --> 1:17:23.642
Members of the jury,
I understand
you have a verdict.

1:17:23.642 --> 1:17:23.667
Members of the jury,

[juror] <i>We, the jury,</i>

[narrator] <i>The conviction</i>

<i>Derek Chauvin</i>

1:17:34.266 --> 1:17:37.467
<i>in the killing of George Floyd</i>
<i>was a small victory</i>

1:17:37.467 --> 1:17:41.667
<i>in a much larger fight</i>
<i>for social justice</i>
<i>and accountability.</i>

1:17:41.667 --> 1:17:44.166
After two weeks,
a verdict has been reached

1:17:44.166 --> 1:17:46.867
in the trial of the three men
accused of chasing,

1:17:46.867 --> 1:17:49.367
shooting,
and killing Ahmaud Arbery.

1:17:49.367 --> 1:17:53.100
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
Travis McMichael, guilty.

1:17:53.100 --> 1:17:53.642
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
William R Bryan, guilty.

1:17:53.642 --> 1:17:56.567
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
William R Bryan, guilty.

1:17:56.567 --> 1:17:59.667
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
Greg McMichael, guilty.

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:03.667
[DeRay] <i>You know</i>
<i>what's so interesting</i>

1:18:03.734 --> 1:18:06.066
<i>is for all of the conversation</i>
<i>that changed.</i>

1:18:06.066 --> 1:18:08.000
The police killed
more people in 2020

1:18:08.066 --> 1:18:11.000
than every single year
we have on date except
for 2018.

1:18:11.066 --> 1:18:12.767
That is wild.

1:18:12.767 --> 1:18:14.834
And a reminder
that narrative change

1:18:14.834 --> 1:18:16.834
does not mean
structural change.

1:18:18.867 --> 1:18:21.767
We have made
some steps forward,

1:18:21.834 --> 1:18:23.642
but also some
giant steps backwards.

1:18:23.642 --> 1:18:24.734
but also some
giant steps backwards.

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:26.967
<i>Legislatures</i>
<i>across the country</i>

1:18:26.967 --> 1:18:29.767
are trying to move
in a direction
of purifying the vote

1:18:29.767 --> 1:18:30.967
so that it's all white.

1:18:32.867 --> 1:18:34.600
<i>The protest</i>
<i>in the streets now,</i>

1:18:34.667 --> 1:18:37.066
I think they're going to have
to escalate for us

<i>to pass the John Lewis law</i>
<i>and the other laws</i>

1:18:39.934 --> 1:18:41.867
that will help to preserve
our democracy.

1:18:43.367 --> 1:18:45.867
[narrator] <i>The John Lewis</i>
<i>Voting Rights Advancement Act</i>

1:18:45.867 --> 1:18:49.066
<i>seeks to restore protections</i>
<i>against voter discrimination,</i>

1:18:49.066 --> 1:18:51.367
<i>targeting people of color.</i>

1:18:51.367 --> 1:18:52.867
<i>And there have been successes,</i>

1:18:52.867 --> 1:18:53.642

1:18:53.642 --> 1:18:56.166
<i>including police reforms</i>
<i>and an anti-lynching bill</i>

1:18:56.166 --> 1:18:59.567
<i>that makes</i>
<i>the crime punishable</i>
<i>by up to 30 years in prison.</i>

1:19:00.667 --> 1:19:02.567
There were 19 states
that passed more

1:19:02.567 --> 1:19:03.934
restrictive use
of force policies.

1:19:03.934 --> 1:19:06.367
There were six states now
who have restricted

1:19:06.367 --> 1:19:08.266
the execution
of no-knock raids.

1:19:09.367 --> 1:19:11.734
We have seen things
happen at a structural level

1:19:11.734 --> 1:19:12.967
in a way
that's really powerful.

1:19:14.166 --> 1:19:15.767
[protesters] We want justice!

1:19:15.834 --> 1:19:19.166
So space is a nice to have,
and that's like a nice

1:19:19.166 --> 1:19:23.500
to have 12 million miles away
from the more immediate
nice to haves, right?

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.867
I'm focused on the must haves,

1:19:26.867 --> 1:19:29.166
<i>and our work is to make</i>
<i>equitable structures.</i>

1:19:29.166 --> 1:19:31.467
<i>It is to make a structure</i>
<i>that doesn't rely</i>

1:19:31.467 --> 1:19:33.266
<i>on a billionaire</i>
<i>to make a decision</i>

1:19:33.266 --> 1:19:37.166
<i>that doesn't rely</i>
<i>on the police</i>
<i>to be good people today.</i>

1:19:37.166 --> 1:19:42.166
[Roland] <i>There have been</i>
<i>so many criticisms of NASA</i>
<i>and space</i>

1:19:42.166 --> 1:19:45.367
and this whole idea
that it's a waste of money.

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:49.667
That actually, to me,
hurts the next generation.

1:19:49.667 --> 1:19:53.642
America can gain
something significant

1:19:53.642 --> 1:19:53.767
America can gain
something significant

1:19:53.767 --> 1:19:59.767
if we recapture this love
of space exploration.

1:20:02.667 --> 1:20:05.000
[Elon] We want to have things
that make us look forward
to the future,

1:20:05.066 --> 1:20:07.834
that, you know,
make us excited to get
out of bed in the morning,

1:20:07.834 --> 1:20:09.867
you know, that are inspiring.

1:20:09.867 --> 1:20:13.000
We have so many problems
that need to be solved.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:16.667
But at the same time,
exploration lends

1:20:16.667 --> 1:20:20.667
technological advances
for humankind.

1:20:20.667 --> 1:20:23.642
We've got to strive
for great things in the future

1:20:23.642 --> 1:20:23.667
We've got to strive
for great things in the future

1:20:23.734 --> 1:20:25.867
and look forward
to exciting developments,

1:20:25.867 --> 1:20:28.600
and, you know, space
is one of those things.

1:20:33.934 --> 1:20:36.867
[Jeffrey] Where NASA will have
its biggest influence

1:20:36.867 --> 1:20:42.600
will continue to be in deep
space exploration,
the Moon and Mars.

1:20:42.667 --> 1:20:44.867
[narrator]
<i>As the private sector</i>
<i>continues to make</i>

1:20:44.934 --> 1:20:48.100
<i>technological leaps,</i>
<i>NASA's focus has shifted</i>

1:20:48.100 --> 1:20:52.767

1:21:03.367 --> 1:21:05.467
and the first person of color

1:21:05.467 --> 1:21:09.734
to set foot on the Moon,
since the Apollo program.

1:21:09.734 --> 1:21:12.300
My space bucket list
consists of one thing,

1:21:12.367 --> 1:21:13.867
to work on the surface
of the Moon.

1:21:13.867 --> 1:21:15.667
That... that's a dream.

1:21:17.767 --> 1:21:22.100
For all humankind
is exactly what space is,

1:21:22.166 --> 1:21:23.642
just like Earth
is for all humankind.

1:21:23.642 --> 1:21:25.000
just like Earth
is for all humankind.

1:21:25.066 --> 1:21:27.967
But we sliced it up in little
ownership parcels, right?

1:21:27.967 --> 1:21:29.567
We can't do that with space.

1:21:29.567 --> 1:21:32.667
[DeRay] <i>I'm hopeful</i>
<i>that topics like</i>
<i>who deserves to be in space,</i>

1:21:32.734 --> 1:21:35.300
<i>that more and more people</i>
<i>who would never thought</i>

1:21:35.367 --> 1:21:39.000
that they could even have
a comment on those things can,
right?

1:21:39.066 --> 1:21:41.166
<i>That people understand</i>
<i>that all of this stuff</i>

1:21:41.166 --> 1:21:44.667
is the decisions of people
and that because people
made it,

1:21:44.667 --> 1:21:46.100
people can make it
differently.

1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:50.600
And we say unapologetically
that Black Lives Matter.

1:21:50.667 --> 1:21:52.100
[protesters]
Black Lives Matter!

1:21:52.166 --> 1:21:53.642
We are powerful,

1:21:53.642 --> 1:21:55.100
We are powerful,

1:21:55.100 --> 1:21:59.400
we are useful,
we are invaluable,

1:21:59.467 --> 1:22:01.500
and we can do
anything together.

1:22:01.567 --> 1:22:04.567
That feeling,
that belief, that spirit,

1:22:04.567 --> 1:22:08.934
I was so grateful to see that
rising back up,
like in the '60s.

1:22:08.934 --> 1:22:12.266
Now, thanks to the spirit
of equality in the air,

1:22:12.266 --> 1:22:15.834
I no longer accept
that my group is second class.

1:22:15.834 --> 1:22:18.266
[Gloria] <i>Many people may feel</i>
<i>that a movement</i>

1:22:18.266 --> 1:22:21.667

1:22:21.667 --> 1:22:22.834
Not true.

1:22:22.834 --> 1:22:23.642

As the great Florynce Kennedy

1:22:28.367 --> 1:22:29.667
Right?

1:22:29.667 --> 1:22:35.100
Three hundred
and seventy marches

1:22:35.166 --> 1:22:38.834
<i>I hope we can make movements</i>

because we were alive,

1:22:43.066 --> 1:22:45.400
the world is a little bit
better than
it would have been.

1:22:46.867 --> 1:22:49.066
I always want kids
to look at me,

1:22:49.066 --> 1:22:50.567
especially kids of color,
and say,

1:22:50.567 --> 1:22:53.642
"Hey, if she did it,
I can do it."

1:22:53.642 --> 1:22:53.934
"Hey, if she did it,
I can do it."

1:22:53.934 --> 1:22:55.734
That's hope.

1:22:55.734 --> 1:23:00.066
To have a young kid
see a rocket ship
leave the planet

1:23:00.066 --> 1:23:04.000
<i>and know that there's somebody</i>
<i>on that rocket ship</i>
<i>that looks like them.</i>

1:23:06.367 --> 1:23:10.934
I personally would like to see
more Victor Glovers.

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.467
<i>Now there's more</i>

1:23:13.467 --> 1:23:17.000
<i>We've got STEM education</i>
<i>for diverse people,</i>

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:21.000
but we have to keep our foot
on the gas of making sure

1:23:21.066 --> 1:23:22.767
that all kids have access

1:23:22.767 --> 1:23:23.642
