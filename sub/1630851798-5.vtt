00:07.875 --> 00:10.844
[dramatic music]

00:10.911 --> 00:14.615
* *

00:25.526 --> 00:28.962
[stirring music]

00:29.029 --> 00:34.935
* *

01:07.901 --> 01:11.839
[epic music]

01:11.905 --> 01:18.846
* *

01:41.001 --> 01:44.138
- What did you do?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.907
- [groans]
I think I broke my leg.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.009
- A compound fracture
specifically.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.945
- I mean the ship.
You tried to steal our ship.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.947
- You mean the one
you stole first?

01:54.014 --> 01:55.649
- She makes a good argument.
- Oh, really?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.318
Now, you're taking her side?

01:57.385 --> 02:01.121
- At least she saved Murf.
It's okay, Murf.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.091
You don't need to be scared.
I'll protect you.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.626
- Janeway to crew.
Do you read me?

02:05.693 --> 02:08.128
- We hear you, Janeway.
Is the ship okay?

02:08.196 --> 02:09.630
- The "Protostar"
landed safely,

02:09.697 --> 02:12.065
10 kilometers away
from your current position.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.968
I'm activating a beacon that
will lead you to the ship.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.905
Diagnostics show minor damage.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.072
[metallic clanking]

02:19.139 --> 02:21.275
Computer, aft view on screen.

02:24.678 --> 02:29.049
[dramatic music]

02:29.116 --> 02:30.818
[alarm blaring]

02:30.884 --> 02:34.322
This ship is about to be
the planet's main course.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.191
I'll hold off these vines
as best I can,

02:37.258 --> 02:38.459
but I suggest
you get here on the double.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.694
- Copy that, Janeway.
Dal out.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.530
Everyone, to the Runaway.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.199
- Uh, about that--

02:46.200 --> 02:50.438
- Aw...you gotta be kidding me!

02:51.405 --> 02:55.108
- The planet seems to have
given up luring us to stay

02:55.175 --> 02:58.145
and has resorted
to more direct methods.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.448
- 10 kilometers just got
a whole lot further.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.350
- Then we'd better
get a move on,

03:02.416 --> 03:05.753
'cause if this planet
eats our ship, we're next.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.187
- What about her?

03:07.255 --> 03:09.089
- She's the reason
we're in this mess.

03:09.156 --> 03:12.360
Don't let her slow us down.

03:12.426 --> 03:16.697
- [moaning, whimpering]

03:19.099 --> 03:20.801
[grunts]
- [gasps]

03:20.868 --> 03:23.304
- I can look after myself.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.042
[whimpering]

03:29.109 --> 03:31.479
[Rok exhales]

03:36.484 --> 03:40.721
- The "Protostar"
is beyond those hills.

03:40.788 --> 03:45.559
[uneasy music]

03:45.626 --> 03:47.661
- I'm freezing.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.930
- "It's safe to breathe,
Jankom Pog.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.733
You won't need that suit,
Jankom Pog."

03:52.800 --> 03:54.234
Ha ha ha ha!

03:54.302 --> 03:56.604
Who's laughing
and breathing now,

03:56.670 --> 03:59.106
nice and toasty
on Murder Planet?

03:59.172 --> 04:00.508
- Pffft!
- Ooh!

04:00.574 --> 04:02.776
Since we found this planet
first,

04:02.843 --> 04:05.579
do we get to name it?
Can we call it Larry?

04:05.646 --> 04:09.650
- I vote we call it "Let's not
visit M-Class planets again."

04:09.717 --> 04:11.352
- Technically,
it's not a planet,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.554
but a sentient life form.

04:13.621 --> 04:18.959
Perhaps I could ask its name.
No, it just wants to eat us.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.896
- Murder Planet it is.
- Aw. I really liked Larry.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.465
- Shh. Quiet.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.635
- Excuse me.
No one's talking to you.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.236
- No. Listen.

04:29.303 --> 04:33.841
[whispering voices]

04:33.907 --> 04:35.843
- Hmm. Uh...

04:35.909 --> 04:37.978
[loud rustling]

04:38.045 --> 04:40.714
- Oh, a sound Jankom
does not like.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.083
- It's just the wind.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.185
- But I don't feel any wind.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.888
- Oh, no.
Where did the hills go?

04:47.955 --> 04:52.259
[ominous music]

04:52.326 --> 04:55.663
- Hmm. Must have gotten
turned around.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.332
Ah, this way.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.341
- Computer,
close shuttle bay doors.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.676
- Acknowledge.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.614
Warning.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.049
Primary and secondary
power offline.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.886
Emergency reserves at 80%.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.322
- Pesky vines are wrapping
into the plasma coils.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.825
No crew. No weapons.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.696
Just access to non-essential
systems. Think.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.499
What would
the real Janeway do?

05:31.565 --> 05:33.901
She would clean the house.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.137
Computer, activate
photonix ship scrubbers,

05:37.204 --> 05:38.839
full disinfection mode.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.384
That ought to do the trick.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.352
[beeping]
Now what?

05:52.420 --> 05:55.589
- Warning.
Power reserves at 50%.

05:55.656 --> 05:59.259
- Computer, display all active
systems of the "Protostar."

05:59.326 --> 06:01.395
Something's
using a lot of power.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.731
Ah, here's the culprit.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.467
Gravimetric "Protostar"
Containment.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.437
Why don't I have
any record of this system?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.071
Computer, shut it down.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.372
- Access denied.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.207
The Gravimetric
"Protostar" Containment

06:14.274 --> 06:15.876
is a high-priority system

06:15.943 --> 06:18.311
requiring command-level
authorization.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.748
- Not even from
a former captain?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.349
- Negative.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.117
- Well, if we're playing
hardball,

06:24.184 --> 06:27.354
shut down food replicators,
and we'll go from there.

06:34.127 --> 06:38.398
- [humming]

06:38.466 --> 06:42.202
Oh!
[growls]

06:43.270 --> 06:46.139
- Ugh. Are we there yet?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.375
- The ship is 10 kilometers
away.

06:48.442 --> 06:52.012
- You said 10 kilometers
10 kilometers ago!

06:52.079 --> 06:54.815
Oh...uh...

06:54.882 --> 06:57.618
[rumbling]

06:57.685 --> 07:02.656
Whoa! Did you see that?
The hills moved.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.494
- Pfft! Hills don't move.
- They do here.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.796
The planet has been
terraforming around us.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.798
- It's trying to scare us?
- No.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.502
Terraforming. It means
the planet is changing.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.470
Usually to become
more habitable.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.439
But in this case,
it's sending us in circles.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.010
[all murmuring, gasping]

07:23.076 --> 07:24.478
- Oh, boy.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.582
- Who's there? What's that?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.350
- I don't know how to feel
in this moment,

07:30.417 --> 07:32.019
but I'm happy to help.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.622
- If the planet can make
our dreams come true,

07:34.688 --> 07:36.657
what about our nightmares?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.091
- Whoa!

07:38.158 --> 07:42.295
[all gasping, whimpering]

07:44.798 --> 07:46.466
- A Watcher!

07:46.534 --> 07:49.369
- Oh, good, ha ha, you're
seeing what Jankom's seeing.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.039
- Fire phasers!

07:52.105 --> 07:56.777
[overlapping shouting]

07:58.912 --> 08:02.315
- How do I turn this on?
Do I just point it now?

08:02.382 --> 08:03.951
- Ah--

08:04.017 --> 08:05.619
Would you give me that?

08:05.686 --> 08:08.221
- I would have hit it
eventually.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.491
- [indistinct shouting]

08:11.559 --> 08:14.027
- Phasers aren't working!

08:16.163 --> 08:17.497
- What are you doing?

08:17.565 --> 08:20.433
This isn't the time
for arts and crafts.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.370
- Jankom!
Gwyn, what are you doing?

08:23.436 --> 08:26.840
[suspenseful music]

08:26.907 --> 08:29.910
* *

08:29.977 --> 08:31.311
- Uhh--

08:33.313 --> 08:37.685
[creature roars]

08:37.751 --> 08:41.488
- Ha ha! Great idea, Gwyn.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.692
Aah! Terrible idea, Gwyn.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.835
- What do we do now?

08:59.206 --> 09:02.810
- We jump.
Aah--

09:03.977 --> 09:07.547
[all screaming, shouting]

09:16.757 --> 09:20.493
- [grunts]
- [groaning]

09:20.560 --> 09:22.495
- Jankom, you win.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.233
Murder Planet is a pretty
fitting name for this place.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.635
- And it hasn't
murdered us yet.

09:27.701 --> 09:31.171
- Yeah. If it weren't for you,
we'd be goners.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.273
- Jankom Pog
never doubted Gwyn.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.777
- The Diviner's daughter
is an excellent shot.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.579
We owe you one.
[Murf squeals]

09:39.647 --> 09:41.514
- Hang on a sec.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.951
If it weren't for Gwyn,
we'd still have our ship.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.453
[sizzle]
Ow!

09:46.519 --> 09:50.123
- Oh, my. Acid rain.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.025
[Murf trilling]

09:52.092 --> 09:54.527
A novel means
for the planet's digestion.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.097
Perhaps we should--
- Find cover!

09:58.666 --> 10:00.467
- Will that work?

10:03.637 --> 10:05.839
- Not as good
as sleeper ship stew,

10:05.906 --> 10:09.142
but these Klingon rations are
still better than eating mud.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.511
Oh, Jankom Pog didn't realize

10:11.578 --> 10:13.914
how much he missed home
till he got here.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.150
- When all of those cute little
fuzzy creatures surrounded me,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.219
they weren't afraid
of how I looked.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.055
I wanted it to be real.
But it wasn't.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.357
- [trilling]

10:24.424 --> 10:27.360
- At first I was confused
why our engine's device

10:27.427 --> 10:29.229
was at the center of the maze.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.432
But after hearing about
all your experiences,

10:32.499 --> 10:35.836
I now understand this place
was using my obsession

10:35.903 --> 10:40.607
to answer that riddle in hope
to keep me here forever.

10:40.674 --> 10:44.044
- Dal, you never told us
what you saw.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
- He wanted to see his family,

10:46.146 --> 10:48.415
but he didn't know
who they were.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.751
- Huh.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.653
- Here. I'm not hungry.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.190
- It's not that bad.

11:04.832 --> 11:09.669
- It's called a Mek'leth.
It's a Klingon weapon.

11:09.737 --> 11:13.040
If warriors didn't make it
off this planet,

11:13.106 --> 11:14.742
it doesn't bode well for us.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.211
- You know, for the record,
I don't care about my parents.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.513
- You didn't say you did.

11:24.785 --> 11:29.923
- [sighs] All my life, people
ask me what species I am.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.126
As if, if I give it a name,
they'd treat me differently.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
Usually, I make something up

11:35.262 --> 11:37.564
'cause, ha,
really, who would know?

11:37.630 --> 11:40.200
But just once,
instead of being asked,

11:40.267 --> 11:42.502
I just wish someone
out there could tell me.

11:42.569 --> 11:46.506
- You want something
that no one can give you.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.743
And I want something
I may never get.

11:51.544 --> 11:56.016
- So that thing--you, like,
control it with your mind?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.617
Cool.
- An heirloom.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.287
The only thing
my father ever gave me.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.056
- Who uses an unfinished
escape shuttle

12:03.123 --> 12:05.125
to jump out
of a moving starship?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.726
[laughing]

12:06.794 --> 12:09.429
Thought I was the one
who didn't think ahead.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.732
Ha ha.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.739
- I can't believe
there are so many stars.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.009
- See that cluster
in the line of stars

12:22.075 --> 12:24.111
to the left, it looks like--

12:24.177 --> 12:27.014
- Like a constipation.
- [laughing]

12:27.080 --> 12:31.551
Constellation. Constipation
is what we'll both have

12:31.618 --> 12:34.387
after eating Jankom's stew.
Ha ha.

12:34.454 --> 12:38.191
- Aww, and there's one
less star for us to look at.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.493
- Least the others
are staying put.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.065
- What is it?
- Stars can't move.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.400
- The stars are fixed points.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.169
We can follow them
right to the ship.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.371
- We've gotta tell the others.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.480
- The coordinates
your Progeny provided

13:00.547 --> 13:03.083
have led us to this
M-Class planet.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.853
Systems detect the "Protostar."

13:05.919 --> 13:09.589
- Take us into orbit.
Beam us down at once.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.395
- Captain's log--ahem--
supplemental.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.664
Even though this planet
tried to trip us up,

13:17.730 --> 13:19.432
we've almost reached
the "Protostar"

13:19.499 --> 13:21.268
by following the stars,

13:21.334 --> 13:28.175
which was my brilliant idea
with a little assist.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.310
- The "Protostar" is just
through these woods.

13:30.377 --> 13:34.882
- Yeah.
Come on, let's keep moving.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.417
- Is that...
- Oh, no.

13:38.886 --> 13:42.022
- Ha ha ha, Murder Planet.
You got us again.

13:42.089 --> 13:45.158
Which one of you guys
thought up this idiot?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.496
Never mind. He's real!

13:49.562 --> 13:53.633
- Well done, young Progeny.
You led us right to them.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.069
- You knew they were coming.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.772
- Step away from the fugitives.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.776
- You don't have to hurt them.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.113
The ship is close.
We can leave them here.

14:06.179 --> 14:11.051
- Step aside, young Progeny.
I will not warn you again.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.720
- Then you'll have to shoot me.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.890
[power up hum]

14:20.493 --> 14:22.195
Go! I'll only slow you down.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.536
- What? No!

14:29.602 --> 14:32.272
- [panting]

14:32.339 --> 14:35.042
Split up.
He can't chase us all.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.069
What part of split up
don't you understand?

15:04.837 --> 15:08.041
- Oh, boy.
[Rok whimpers]

15:09.476 --> 15:12.579
[dark music]

15:12.645 --> 15:19.086
* *

15:34.667 --> 15:37.604
[Jankom grunting, moaning]

15:37.670 --> 15:39.239
- That was good thinking, kid.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.840
Now, let's get back
to the ship.

15:40.907 --> 15:43.643
- What about Gwyn?
- She did save us.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.479
- We wouldn't need saving
if she hadn't given us up.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.548
She made her choice.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.226
- [moaning]

16:08.968 --> 16:12.939
[whimpering, coughs]

16:15.042 --> 16:18.011
My Diviner.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.130
- Salvation.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.434
- Diviner. Help!

16:47.107 --> 16:49.242
- My Progeny.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.248
[metallic creaking]

16:56.549 --> 16:59.186
[Gwyn groaning]

17:08.595 --> 17:09.996
- Please!

17:10.063 --> 17:12.399
- I'm sorry.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.604
- Father!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.606
Father!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.449
- Lifeforms detected nearby.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.484
- About time.
Okay.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.320
Let's get the ship
ready for takeoff.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.122
- Preparing for
immediate departure.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.376
[triumphant music]

18:04.251 --> 18:07.420
- It's not real.
It's not real.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.788
- Go, go, go!

18:08.855 --> 18:10.490
- I'm already proceeding
in a rapid forward motion.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.426
I cannot do it in triplicate.
- Where's Gwyn?

18:33.980 --> 18:37.684
- Lower.
- I can't go any lower.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.587
- I can't...reach her.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.762
Yes! Up, up!

18:49.829 --> 18:52.999
[stirring music]

18:53.065 --> 18:56.703
* *

18:56.769 --> 18:58.938
- You came back for me.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.441
- We owed you one.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.361
- Your Progeny betrayed us.

19:24.464 --> 19:28.167
- Get us out of here.
Maximum warp.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.569
- I suggest you set a course.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.171
- To where?
- As far away as possible.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.241
- Setting course.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.610
- Warp engine engaged.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.055
- It's good to have
the entire crew safely aboard.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.858
- [sobs]

19:51.924 --> 19:54.361
He chose the ship.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.863
- You're with us now.
He can't hurt you anymore.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.599
- That's not actually factual.
Something's locked

19:59.666 --> 20:02.702
onto our warp signature
and is gaining fast.

20:02.769 --> 20:07.073
[dramatic music]

20:07.139 --> 20:12.845
* *

20:12.912 --> 20:14.281
- Can we go any faster?

20:14.347 --> 20:17.116
- Jankom Pog would, if he
could, but something called

20:17.183 --> 20:19.619
the Gravimetric
"Protostar" Containment

20:19.686 --> 20:22.121
is gobbling up
the rest of the juice.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.056
- "Protostar" containment.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.427
- That giant ship is locked
onto us with a tractor beam.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.829
- We need outta here--disable
the "Protostar" Containment.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.766
- Stop. The "Protostar" isn't
just the name of the ship.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.269
The engine is a protostar!

20:36.336 --> 20:39.406
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
So we're carrying around

20:39.472 --> 20:42.875
a baby star inside the ship?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.611
- Baby star?

20:44.677 --> 20:49.316
- Which means our warp drive
has one heck of a kick.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.318
- I hate to interrupt
the science lesson,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.052
but we're being hailed.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.388
- On screen.

20:55.455 --> 20:59.359
- My Progeny, you're alive.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.895
- You chose the ship.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.432
- I had no choice.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.099
- Time's running out.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.640
- If you want to save your
friends, surrender the ship.

21:13.706 --> 21:18.144
You're going to do
the right thing...

21:18.210 --> 21:20.513
aren't you, Gwyn?

21:23.182 --> 21:26.118
- You're right. I am.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.956
Computer, engage protostar.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.558
- Progeny.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.632
- Something's happening.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.407
- Engaging Proto-Warp
in three...

21:47.474 --> 21:50.209
- Gwyn--Gwyn!
- Two.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.045
- You made your choice, Father.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.581
Now I've made mine.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.215
- One.
- Gwyn, stop.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.317
- Engaged.

22:08.027 --> 22:11.197
- They engaged the protostar.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.265
Can you track them?

22:13.332 --> 22:17.804
- They are no longer
on our maps.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.606
- She's gone.
