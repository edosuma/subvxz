00:02.052 --> 00:03.832
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.833 --> 00:06.252
I want you compel to forget
that I ever loved him.

00:06.253 --> 00:08.853
- Who is Damon Salvatore.
- He was a monster.

00:09.154 --> 00:11.817
- Where the hell are we?
- 1994.

00:11.818 --> 00:13.069
We're never getting out.

00:13.070 --> 00:14.620
There's someone else here.

00:14.621 --> 00:16.322
To get home we'll harness
the power of the eclipse

00:16.323 --> 00:19.191
using a mystical relic.
It's called an ascendant.

00:19.192 --> 00:21.093
[Thwap]

00:21.094 --> 00:22.128
Unh!

00:22.129 --> 00:23.428
Forgetting someone?

00:26.632 --> 00:28.167
Aah!

00:28.168 --> 00:30.354
I'm back.

00:30.355 --> 00:32.104
I know what Alaric is. I know what you are.

00:32.104 --> 00:33.272
You're a witch.

00:33.273 --> 00:35.116
Wait. You're from Mystic Falls?

00:35.117 --> 00:38.472
Born and raised. One of the
founding families actually.

00:39.012 --> 00:41.246
Stefan could have told me
there was a hunter in town.

00:41.247 --> 00:43.482
- Elena: I want my memories back.
- Wait. What?

00:43.483 --> 00:45.366
I want Alaric to uncompel me.

00:47.397 --> 00:48.821
Alaric!

00:48.822 --> 00:50.322
[Gasps]

00:50.323 --> 00:51.757
I'm not supposed to be alive.

00:51.758 --> 00:53.731
Alaric's not a vampire anymore, Elena.

00:53.732 --> 00:55.003
He's human.

00:55.004 --> 00:56.894
There's a girl you need to go see.

00:59.868 --> 01:01.666
[Knocking on door]

01:07.072 --> 01:09.867
Ok. I'll start.

01:10.378 --> 01:11.877
I know Alaric "eternal sunshined"

01:11.878 --> 01:13.312
our relationship out of your brain,

01:13.313 --> 01:16.014
but please, please tell me it's coming back

01:16.015 --> 01:17.916
or at least part of it because imagining

01:17.917 --> 01:21.028
this exact moment is what got
me through the last few months.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.126
I'm not sure what to say.

01:28.127 --> 01:30.272
Easy, so easy. Just say

01:30.273 --> 01:32.830
that you missed me as much as I missed you.

01:38.288 --> 01:42.807
I remember... pain.

01:42.808 --> 01:45.343
I remember all the
terrible things that you did

01:45.344 --> 01:47.630
to the people that I care about.

01:48.247 --> 01:51.883
I honestly don't remember
anything good between us.

01:51.884 --> 01:54.819
I thought if I saw you in person it might

01:54.820 --> 01:56.321
change everything, but...

01:56.322 --> 01:57.822
Maybe you just need a little more time.

01:57.823 --> 01:59.791
Damon, I know that I loved you.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.192
Yeah.

02:01.193 --> 02:03.861
And I know that apparently I forgave you

02:03.862 --> 02:05.597
for all of the awful things that you did.

02:05.598 --> 02:06.902
Yeah.

02:06.903 --> 02:08.812
But I just don't remember it.

02:10.435 --> 02:12.445
I'm sorry. I...

02:13.372 --> 02:16.140
I just don't...

02:16.141 --> 02:18.041
Feel it anymore.

02:21.079 --> 02:22.913
I'm sorry.

02:24.415 --> 02:25.916
Yeah.

02:27.785 --> 02:29.817
I'm, uh... ahem.

02:31.223 --> 02:32.722
Yeah.

02:36.394 --> 02:40.698
Damon, I... I really am sorry.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.233
Uh...

02:54.315 --> 02:56.147
Alaric: Hey. I really
don't think you should be

02:56.148 --> 02:58.549
playing with all that stuff.

02:58.550 --> 03:02.119
Keep going. We are on a roll.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.788
All the terrible things I did to people

03:03.789 --> 03:05.256
that Elena cared about. Let's see.

03:05.257 --> 03:06.423
I turned Caroline into my own

03:06.424 --> 03:08.058
personal blood juice box,

03:08.059 --> 03:10.060
I turned Matt's sister into a vampire

03:10.061 --> 03:11.962
and threatened to kill
Bon-Bon a couple times.

03:11.963 --> 03:13.330
More than a couple.

03:13.331 --> 03:14.899
Subjective. Sometimes, I was being funny.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.332
And you killed Stefan's best friend

03:16.334 --> 03:18.836
at his birthday party.

03:18.837 --> 03:21.005
Unfortunate coincidence.

03:21.006 --> 03:22.805
And then you snapped Jeremy's neck

03:22.807 --> 03:24.241
when Elena said she'd never love you.

03:24.242 --> 03:25.508
On second thought, let's focus on all

03:25.510 --> 03:26.944
the charming, heroic things

03:26.945 --> 03:29.146
you obliterated from my girl's mind.

03:29.147 --> 03:31.448
God, if I could take it all back, I would.

03:31.449 --> 03:33.094
I know.

03:34.355 --> 03:36.653
And listen. Despite the fact

03:36.654 --> 03:38.455
that my long list of dastardly deeds

03:38.456 --> 03:42.693
involves killing you,
I'm glad you're alive.

03:42.694 --> 03:45.829
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.097
Unh!

03:47.098 --> 03:49.700
Although had you actually died a vampire

03:49.701 --> 03:51.668
instead of becoming human again,

03:51.669 --> 03:52.869
your compulsion would have gone away,

03:52.870 --> 03:54.037
and Elena would be mine again.

03:54.038 --> 03:56.840
Hey. Really heartfelt. Appreciate it.

03:56.841 --> 03:59.242
Now she's stuck with only evil me memories

03:59.243 --> 04:01.111
forever and ever.

04:01.112 --> 04:03.213
If you kill me, I am
dead for good this time.

04:03.214 --> 04:04.748
You remember that.

04:04.749 --> 04:08.251
[Monitor flatlining]

04:08.252 --> 04:10.153
Good morning.

04:10.154 --> 04:11.821
Hey. I don't know if this is a good time.

04:11.822 --> 04:13.323
Just a heads-up, Doc.

04:13.324 --> 04:14.825
You're gonna be in real high demand

04:14.826 --> 04:16.493
with a bunch of vampires
who want to be human again

04:16.494 --> 04:18.827
if you could repeat
that little healing trick

04:18.829 --> 04:20.997
that you did at the
border with Ric last night.

04:20.998 --> 04:22.465
Well, just a heads-up,

04:22.466 --> 04:23.733
but saving Alaric's life was a matter

04:23.734 --> 04:25.535
of a treatable death wound,

04:25.536 --> 04:27.337
perfect timing, and fear of losing

04:27.338 --> 04:30.006
the most interesting guy I've
dated in a while adrenaline.

04:30.007 --> 04:33.843
100% unrepeatable, which
is why you will tell no one.

04:33.844 --> 04:35.545
- She's bossy.
- Mm-hmm.

04:35.546 --> 04:36.912
I like her.

04:36.914 --> 04:39.015
Ugh.

04:39.016 --> 04:41.451
Do you have a nice suit
and a clean pair of socks?

04:41.452 --> 04:43.019
Uh, yeah, I think so.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.054
Good. I'm releasing you.

04:45.055 --> 04:46.689
Hospital fundraiser's tonight.

04:46.690 --> 04:48.726
I'm making the interns
go, so I need a date.

04:48.727 --> 04:50.557
Start your paperwork.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.034
Hello again. That was quite a mess

04:58.035 --> 05:00.103
you made at the border last night.

05:00.104 --> 05:03.272
Hit-and-run. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

05:03.273 --> 05:05.274
Good thing Matt here
was in the neighborhood

05:05.275 --> 05:07.076
to give you a ride home.

05:07.077 --> 05:08.544
You brought me here?

05:08.545 --> 05:10.113
You went after my
friends. What'd you expect?

05:10.114 --> 05:12.415
Your friends who kill people.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.617
Stefan: Come on, Enzo. Ask
him what you want to know.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.219
Let's get this over with.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.588
Stefan has already made
a very passionate argument

05:18.589 --> 05:20.756
in favor of snapping your neck,

05:20.757 --> 05:22.492
whereas in a surprising role reversal,

05:22.493 --> 05:24.694
I've opted for the
let's think this through,

05:24.695 --> 05:26.692
get all the information
before we kill him method.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.064
Don't be a dick. You know, you can

05:28.065 --> 05:30.353
dry the vervain out of him,
compel him to forget everything,

05:30.354 --> 05:31.900
and he'll never set foot
in Mystic Falls again.

05:31.901 --> 05:34.003
You don't really think he's
a one-man vampire busting

05:34.004 --> 05:35.602
operation, do you?

05:37.135 --> 05:40.126
Look. While Tripp tortured me
for the names of your friends,

05:40.127 --> 05:42.611
I had a front-row seat to
quite a few urgent phone calls

05:42.612 --> 05:45.147
and visits from mysterious right-hand men,

05:45.148 --> 05:47.116
many of whom were wearing uniforms

05:47.117 --> 05:49.985
not dissimilar to the one
you've been traipsing around in.

05:49.986 --> 05:51.654
I'd just like to know what they're up to

05:51.655 --> 05:53.912
while he's here with us.

06:00.929 --> 06:02.865
Aah! Aah.

06:02.866 --> 06:04.099
They're doing the same thing they were

06:04.100 --> 06:05.401
when they were with me.

06:05.402 --> 06:08.870
They're tracking vampires like
your friend Caroline Forbes.

06:10.386 --> 06:12.441
Take two hours, get the names of his men

06:12.442 --> 06:13.609
and what they know.

06:13.610 --> 06:16.544
After that, he's a
liability. Get rid of him.

06:18.414 --> 06:20.021
You didn't feel anything?

06:20.022 --> 06:24.040
I felt scared and guilty,

06:24.374 --> 06:27.022
and his eyes were really,
really blue and pretty,

06:27.023 --> 06:29.132
but... no.

06:29.459 --> 06:31.293
I don't remember loving him.

06:31.294 --> 06:33.662
So you don't remember. So be it.

06:33.663 --> 06:35.030
That's your advice?

06:35.031 --> 06:36.765
Well, Elena, look at your life right now.

06:36.766 --> 06:39.802
You're doing well in school,
you're following your dreams,

06:39.803 --> 06:42.516
you met Liam, who also
has very pretty eyes,

06:42.517 --> 06:45.018
not mention he's never killed your brother.

06:45.019 --> 06:46.608
True.

06:46.609 --> 06:48.077
I mean, I just gave Stefan the friend boot.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.611
Maybe a little break from
the Salvatore brothers

06:49.612 --> 06:51.580
is in the cards for the both of us.

06:51.581 --> 06:55.484
Look. McDreamy's coming. I got to go.

06:55.485 --> 06:57.652
- See you later.
- Bye.

07:00.389 --> 07:02.090
So guess who came into the hospital

07:02.091 --> 07:03.992
for a shoulder arthroscopy this morning.

07:03.993 --> 07:05.260
Hello to you, too.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.930
Lady Whitmore, the girl from the bonfire,

07:07.931 --> 07:10.165
the one you miraculously
saved from certain death

07:10.166 --> 07:11.666
and I can't figure out how.

07:11.668 --> 07:13.068
Turns out she was here
on a tennis scholarship

07:13.069 --> 07:15.037
before she blew out her arm last year.

07:15.038 --> 07:16.505
Now she needs to get
her cartilage cleaned out

07:16.506 --> 07:17.906
every 6 months.

07:17.907 --> 07:19.574
You're still obsessing over that.

07:19.575 --> 07:20.976
But here's the crazy part.

07:20.977 --> 07:22.310
She doesn't remember getting hurt

07:22.312 --> 07:24.146
in the corn maze crash.

07:24.147 --> 07:26.581
Wow! She must have been really drunk.

07:26.582 --> 07:28.917
I'm gonna take a look at her labs,

07:28.918 --> 07:30.118
see if she's not an alien

07:30.119 --> 07:31.620
or a super soldier or something.

07:31.621 --> 07:33.355
Heh heh.

07:33.356 --> 07:36.858
When do volunteers have
access to the patient labs?

07:36.859 --> 07:39.261
Since never, but if you rat me out,

07:39.262 --> 07:41.663
you can't be my date to the
hospital fundraiser tonight.

07:41.664 --> 07:43.198
Yeah? Well, we have to go.

07:43.199 --> 07:45.267
Jo said that it's mandatory.

07:45.268 --> 07:47.167
Doesn't mean it can't still be a date.

Kai: Oh. Look who's awake.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.524
How do you feel?

08:09.525 --> 08:11.707
Like you shot me with an arrow.

08:12.294 --> 08:14.829
Right. Anyhoo, I have no idea

08:14.830 --> 08:16.230
how you managed to shatter the ascendant

08:16.231 --> 08:17.732
into a billion pieces,

08:17.733 --> 08:18.900
but we need to put it together

08:18.901 --> 08:20.935
before the eclipse at 12:28.

08:20.936 --> 08:24.717
You want to help? I know
you're a puzzle person.

08:24.718 --> 08:27.943
I don't want to help. You're a psychopath.

08:27.944 --> 08:30.697
This place is your prison.
I'm not letting you out.

08:30.698 --> 08:34.315
Besides, you'll just kill
me the minute we get out.

08:34.316 --> 08:36.183
You've been through a trauma.

08:36.184 --> 08:38.019
Your memory's probably
a little fuzzy right now,

08:38.020 --> 08:40.421
so you might be thinking that
your magic will protect you,

08:40.422 --> 08:43.191
but all I have to do is hold your hand,

08:43.192 --> 08:46.093
and your magic suddenly becomes mine.

08:46.094 --> 08:49.997
What was that? Huh? What?

08:49.998 --> 08:54.135
You're gonna do the spell
and finally get us home?

Agh!

- That's weird.
- What's weird?

09:21.296 --> 09:23.597
None of your business.
We're not friends anymore,

09:23.598 --> 09:25.065
which means you can't just show up

09:25.066 --> 09:27.036
unannounced at my door. Good-bye.

09:27.037 --> 09:29.470
Hey, Caroline. Look. You're not safe.

09:29.471 --> 09:31.105
Tripp's men still have your name.

09:31.106 --> 09:33.407
So, what? You here to protect me?

09:33.408 --> 09:35.209
News flash! I don't need your protection,

09:35.210 --> 09:37.381
and more importantly, I don't want it.

[Cell phone rings]

09:39.581 --> 09:41.181
Hey, mom. Can I call you back?

09:41.182 --> 09:44.384
I'm trying to get a piece
of gum off of my shoe.

09:44.385 --> 09:46.285
Actually, honey, this can't wait.

09:48.222 --> 09:50.757
Do you have any idea
where Tripp Cook might be?

09:50.758 --> 09:53.093
Tripp? No. I have no idea. Why?

09:53.094 --> 09:56.263
Because one of his men
just ran me off the road,

09:56.264 --> 09:58.698
and they're gonna kill me
if they don't get him back.

10:04.343 --> 10:07.012
Caroline: Answer your phone, Enzo!

10:07.013 --> 10:09.581
I just... I didn't call
her today, you know?

10:09.582 --> 10:11.550
I always call my mom
every Saturday morning,

10:11.551 --> 10:13.652
but, no, today, I said, "screw it.

23:16.255 --> 23:19.991
Knowing that there's this
whole piece of my life missing,

23:19.992 --> 23:23.795
it's... it's driving me crazy, ok?

23:23.796 --> 23:27.031
So I have to at least try to get it back.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.967
Yeah.

23:28.968 --> 23:30.835
How are you supposed to do that?

23:30.836 --> 23:33.271
I know there's nothing we
can do about the compulsion,

23:33.272 --> 23:37.108
but maybe if we unwind
the memories backwards,

23:37.109 --> 23:38.876
something might trigger something,

23:38.877 --> 23:41.878
and maybe they'll all come back, right?

23:41.880 --> 23:45.049
Yeah. Sure. Tell me what you want me to do.

23:47.319 --> 23:50.287
Take me to the last place
I told you I loved you.

23:54.825 --> 23:56.644
I brought you a present.

24:01.599 --> 24:05.336
Ta-da! Ms. Cuddles!

24:05.337 --> 24:07.338
Thought you might want to bring her along.

24:07.339 --> 24:08.872
Thanks.

24:10.690 --> 24:13.210
I know you think I'm a monster.

24:13.211 --> 24:18.348
I mean, I did murder or heavily
maim most of my immediate family,

24:18.350 --> 24:21.118
but after a long period of self-reflection,

24:21.169 --> 24:22.703
I've come to the conclusion

24:22.704 --> 24:24.305
that I could have handled my anger better.

24:24.306 --> 24:25.906
You said you wanted to get out of here...

24:25.907 --> 24:27.875
And I quote... "To give the rest

24:27.876 --> 24:30.644
of the Gemini coven an excruciating death."

24:30.645 --> 24:32.980
I didn't mean it.

24:32.981 --> 24:38.063
Honestly, I would do anything
to get my family back,

24:38.064 --> 24:40.087
and the thing I'm most scared of

24:40.088 --> 24:44.258
is trying to figure out how
to live in the world again.

24:44.259 --> 24:47.727
Sort of hoping you've been
a positive influence on me.

24:47.729 --> 24:50.130
You're a good person, Bonnie.

24:50.131 --> 24:55.335

Ok. Let's do this. Let her go,

put it somewhere safe.

anyone what you were doing,

29:13.670 --> 29:16.272
and the next thing I know, you're dead.

29:16.273 --> 29:18.574
I heard that you drove
your car into the grill

29:18.575 --> 29:20.676
and then blew yourself up so that you could

29:20.677 --> 29:22.111
trigger some explosion.

29:28.721 --> 29:30.388
I was all ready to go, and the door opens,

29:30.389 --> 29:31.723
and you jump in the car and say,

29:31.724 --> 29:33.091
"we're in this together,"

29:33.092 --> 29:35.326
and you weren't taking no for an answer.

29:35.327 --> 29:36.961
That was the moment I realized you were

29:36.962 --> 29:38.797
the perfect girl for me because you were

29:38.798 --> 29:41.039
just as crazy as I was.

Ok. Tell me more. Something happy.

is a motel ice machine

What else?

29:54.446 --> 29:56.581
Well, can't forget the
night of your graduation.

29:56.582 --> 29:59.217

gonna apologize for it.

one that I've relived a million
times over the last 4 months

before you went off to college.

30:21.573 --> 30:23.975
You wanted to show me this meteor shower,

30:23.976 --> 30:27.478
so we drove out in the middle of nowhere,

stars started to fall, rain,

30:32.584 --> 30:35.086
lots of rain.

to try a little harder.

30:59.978 --> 31:02.479
I get that we had an amazing life together,

31:02.480 --> 31:05.816
and I know that I loved the fact

31:05.817 --> 31:09.286
that you were reckless and probably

31:09.287 --> 31:12.356
made me feel very free,

into your eyes, I just...

able to give you what you want,

34:09.717 --> 34:11.451

Maybe it's because I thought

34:11.452 --> 34:13.786
you worth having a thing for,

34:13.788 --> 34:16.023
because when I woke up as a vampire

34:16.024 --> 34:17.190
you told me that I would get through it

because when I watched Elena
move on with your brother

I couldn't imagine why she
would let anyone like you go,

the way that I treated you.

tiny piece of you felt for me

what I was starting to feel for you

and I accept your apology.

Yes.

Yeah, I hate you

35:34.735 --> 35:38.337
because if I don't hate you
for ruining our friendship,

35:38.338 --> 35:40.429
then I have to hate myself for ruining it,

35:40.430 --> 35:42.878
and I think that I
deserve better than that.

35:52.755 --> 35:55.591

35:55.592 --> 36:00.763
just bits and pieces, but, um...

36:00.764 --> 36:03.098
There were these stars,

36:03.099 --> 36:06.635
and then it started to rain.

36:06.636 --> 36:10.773
When you became a vampire,
part of me was thrilled

36:10.774 --> 36:12.808
because suddenly there was this possibility

36:12.809 --> 36:15.330
I could have you in my life forever,

36:16.679 --> 36:18.614
but then the other part
of me was devastated

36:18.615 --> 36:24.086
because I realized you'd lost
the life that you wanted to have.

36:24.087 --> 36:27.990

then what happened, Damon?

36:27.991 --> 36:29.191

but the truth is is...

36:42.471 --> 36:45.607
You're better off without me.

36:45.608 --> 36:48.844
What are you talking about?

36:48.845 --> 36:51.847
I died. You started over.

36:51.848 --> 36:54.516
I need you to live your life.

36:54.517 --> 36:56.050
Be happy.

36:57.852 --> 36:59.941
I love you, Elena.

37:04.059 --> 37:06.072
Enough to let you go.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.905
It started to rain, and then what?

37:20.909 --> 37:22.810
It got cold and muddy.

37:25.246 --> 37:27.781
You were miserable, so
we got in the car and...

37:29.751 --> 37:31.598
We drove home.

37:51.539 --> 37:53.608
Ok.

37:53.609 --> 37:55.108
Ohh.

37:57.211 --> 38:00.181
I might have to rethink
this whole painkiller thing.

38:00.182 --> 38:03.117
I need to get out of this
dress and order a pizza.

38:03.118 --> 38:05.753
Ok.

38:05.754 --> 38:07.254
[Groans]

38:10.191 --> 38:12.759
[Cloth rustling]

38:22.565 --> 38:23.838
Ouch.

38:23.839 --> 38:27.208
This? Yeah I had an
accident when I was younger.

38:27.209 --> 38:29.781
- I lost my spleen.
- Car accident?

38:29.782 --> 38:31.311
Actually it was less an accident

38:31.313 --> 38:34.815
and more like my brother tried
to gut me with a hunting knife.

38:34.816 --> 38:36.650
Like I said, tragically
dysfunctional family.

38:36.651 --> 38:37.618
Yeah.

38:37.619 --> 38:38.918
Ha!

38:38.920 --> 38:40.968
I just killed the mood, didn't I?

38:40.969 --> 38:43.991
No, no. Let's just say,

38:43.992 --> 38:48.162
uh, we both have complicated, tragic,

38:48.163 --> 38:50.129
and dysfunctional histories.

38:53.470 --> 38:55.390
Guess we're a match.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.382
[Knock knock]

39:08.383 --> 39:09.383
Hey.

39:09.384 --> 39:10.884
Hey.

39:10.885 --> 39:12.319
You're still talking to me.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.687
Sorry I ran out like that.

39:18.358 --> 39:19.960
What's this?

39:19.961 --> 39:21.795
So I finally got a look
at lady Whitmore's labs.

39:21.796 --> 39:24.664
Turns out they sent her home
without doing the shoulder surgery

39:24.665 --> 39:27.000
because the injury doesn't exist anymore.

39:27.001 --> 39:29.536
Seems to have spontaneously healed itself,

39:29.537 --> 39:32.372
and all this after meeting
your dead boyfriend tonight?

39:32.373 --> 39:34.374
None of this adds up.

39:34.375 --> 39:36.376
The only thing that's really clear
is that you're not just a liar,

39:36.377 --> 39:38.979
but you're a liar with secrets,

39:38.980 --> 39:40.413
so you can tell me the truth,

39:40.414 --> 39:42.449
or I can figure this out on my own.

39:42.450 --> 39:45.284
[Music playing]

39:52.321 --> 39:53.926
[Sighs]

39:57.397 --> 40:00.035
One for you, one for me.

40:01.936 --> 40:04.303
Cheers, Horatio Fell.

40:11.144 --> 40:13.645
[Thunder]

40:26.105 --> 40:28.261
Come on. It's time to abandon ship.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.096
No, no, no, wait.

40:30.097 --> 40:32.098
Just give it a second.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.598
It will clear up.

40:53.753 --> 40:55.920
Promise me this is forever.

40:58.057 --> 40:59.191
I promise.

40:59.192 --> 41:02.183
[Music continues]

41:25.551 --> 41:27.285
To optimism.

41:34.827 --> 41:36.294
Bonnie.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.734
You're still alive.
