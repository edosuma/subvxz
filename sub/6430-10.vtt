WEBVTT

00:00.318 --> 00:02.418
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.515 --> 00:04.516
Rebecca St. Clair?
You found Jack.

00:04.584 --> 00:05.750
You weren't
just his girlfriend.

00:05.818 --> 00:07.085
You're a Warehouse Agent.

00:07.153 --> 00:09.187
I always knew
if we didn't quit,

00:09.255 --> 00:11.456
one of us, one day,
would lose the other.

00:11.524 --> 00:13.959
One last thing that you might
be interested in seeing.

00:14.026 --> 00:16.761
Together...Forever.

00:16.829 --> 00:19.798
I guess Jack chose you
over the Warehouse, after all.

00:19.866 --> 00:23.869
It says that the debronze
function was activated twice.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.872
Who's our mystery guest?
Pete, Artie says

00:26.939 --> 00:28.707
that H.G. Wells is actually--
a woman.

00:28.774 --> 00:30.642
I was apprenticed
at Warehouse 12.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.211
My daughter Christina
had been murdered.

00:33.279 --> 00:36.114
Everything that ever mattered
in my life is gone now.

00:36.182 --> 00:37.649
Except the Warehouse.

00:37.717 --> 00:39.718
I want to come back
and work there again.

00:39.785 --> 00:42.354
She is nothing like me!
I'll never trust that woman.

00:42.421 --> 00:44.823
H.G. Wells is to be
fully reinstated

00:44.891 --> 00:46.858
as a Warehouse Agent.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:02.174 --> 01:05.075
What are you doing here?

01:05.144 --> 01:06.211
No.

01:06.279 --> 01:07.512
Oh!

01:09.181 --> 01:10.849
No!

01:23.663 --> 01:24.963
Do I make you nervous,
darling?

01:25.031 --> 01:27.032
No. Naw. Nervous?

01:27.099 --> 01:28.867
Why would you make me nervous?

01:28.935 --> 01:30.402
You're part of the team now

01:30.469 --> 01:32.270
and...Not evil.

01:32.338 --> 01:34.606
Artie! Good.
M-morning.

01:34.674 --> 01:36.408
Good morning, Artie.
Why is no one here?

01:36.475 --> 01:37.709
I'm here.
Congratulations.

01:37.777 --> 01:40.679
I'll have a gold star
delivered to your room.

01:40.746 --> 01:43.081
Where are the others?
Right here. Hey, guys.

01:43.149 --> 01:44.716
Claud,
did you drop something?

01:44.784 --> 01:46.384
Uh, yeah, I just had
a little slippery fingers.

01:46.452 --> 01:48.019
I make her nervous.

01:48.087 --> 01:49.521
Claud, there's no need
for you to be nervous.

01:49.589 --> 01:51.690
I'm not.
I wasn't. Jeez.

01:51.757 --> 01:54.059
It's okay--there will be
a period of adjustment.

01:54.126 --> 01:55.794
Although, I have already
earned a gold star.

01:55.861 --> 01:57.295
Why does she get
a gold star?

01:57.363 --> 01:59.397
She doesn't.

01:59.465 --> 02:01.733
Let's talk about
your next assignment.

02:01.801 --> 02:04.569
Shouldn't there be
some orientation for H.G.?

02:04.637 --> 02:07.238
It's not necessary.
Let's not make a fuss.

02:07.306 --> 02:08.840
Well, yeah, you already
got a gold star.

02:08.907 --> 02:10.875
There is no gold star!
There won't be orientation.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.877
It's bad enough
she's here--at all!

02:12.945 --> 02:15.046
Can we just try
to get through this?

02:17.483 --> 02:19.584
Well, now I'm nervous.

02:19.652 --> 02:21.620
Why do things have to change,
because of her?

02:24.557 --> 02:26.591
Excuse me.

02:26.659 --> 02:28.960
Rebecca?

02:29.028 --> 02:33.498
Are you kids still in
the artifact finding business?

02:36.302 --> 02:39.504
Jonah Ross, 82.
Local English teacher.

02:39.572 --> 02:41.606
Died of natural causes.
A friend of yours?

02:41.674 --> 02:44.576
Hardly. Jonah Ross
was actually Jonah Raitt.

02:44.644 --> 02:48.279
In 1961, he was an editor
of <i>Where & When</i> magazine.

02:48.347 --> 02:50.515
He killed
three of his secretaries.

02:50.583 --> 02:52.417
And his wife.

02:52.485 --> 02:54.953
He used an artifact that
altered their body chemistry--

02:55.021 --> 02:57.255
skin, bone, muscle, blood.

02:57.323 --> 02:59.157
Turned them all to glass.

02:59.225 --> 03:02.594
Jack and I never found him
or the artifact.

03:02.662 --> 03:04.162
Two of the women died

03:04.230 --> 03:05.764
before we got on
the glass girl case.

03:05.831 --> 03:08.667
We could have saved Raitt's wife
and Roxanne Crane,

03:08.734 --> 03:10.301
but Jonah did something
to us.

03:10.369 --> 03:13.338
We had no memory
the entire day they were killed.

03:13.406 --> 03:14.906
Then he disappeared.

03:14.974 --> 03:17.842
All those years, Raitt and I
were living in the same city.

03:17.910 --> 03:21.546
I went to his address to I.D.
and retrieve the artifact, but--

03:21.614 --> 03:23.181
But you didn't
find anything.

03:23.249 --> 03:24.382
He wrote this obituary
himself.

03:24.450 --> 03:25.884
Read the last line.

03:25.951 --> 03:27.752
"If you're still out there,
Jack and Rebecca,

03:27.820 --> 03:29.754
thanks for my life"?

03:29.822 --> 03:32.590
You think he was taunting you?
He was a cruel son of a bitch.

03:32.658 --> 03:35.260
The artifact
is still out there a in play.

03:35.327 --> 03:38.196
No one else should die because
I couldn't crack down on this.

03:38.264 --> 03:40.331
We need to find it.

03:40.399 --> 03:41.566
All right,
I'll go to St. Louis.

03:41.634 --> 03:42.834
I'll check out
the house again.

03:42.902 --> 03:44.035
Claudia,
forward me the info.

03:44.103 --> 03:46.104
I n use the field time.

03:46.172 --> 03:48.506
Uh, Artie,
you don't want us to go?

03:48.574 --> 03:50.208
No, I got this.

03:50.276 --> 03:52.444
It's getting a little
crowded around here.

03:52.511 --> 03:54.479
Artie,
I'd like to come with you.

03:54.547 --> 03:56.614
Fine.

03:56.682 --> 03:58.616
We'll find him.

04:00.453 --> 04:03.088
You say you...
Both blacked out.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.256
Apparently, Jack and I
went about our lives.

04:05.324 --> 04:06.991
We just couldn't remember it.

04:07.059 --> 04:09.360
We assumed that Jonah
caused it.

04:09.428 --> 04:11.396
Was it 24 hours exactly?
No.

04:11.464 --> 04:14.566
It was 22 hours
and 19 minutes.

04:15.968 --> 04:18.002
I'm very observant.
Why?

04:21.707 --> 04:24.075
I don't care if it is
the H.G. Wells section.

04:24.143 --> 04:26.811
What the hell
are we doin' down here?

04:26.879 --> 04:29.147
Why does it matter that
it was 22 hours and 19 minutes?

04:29.215 --> 04:31.649
What does it mean?

04:31.717 --> 04:34.986
It means someone
used my time machine.

04:37.654 --> 04:41.754
<font color=#7fff00>âª Warehouse 13 2x10 âª</font>
<font color=#ffff00>Where and When</font>
<font color=#ffff00>Original Air Date on September 7, 2010</font>

04:41.764 --> 04:46.664
-- sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> --
-- for <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.Com</font> --

05:12.091 --> 05:14.192
It's not a vehicle
like in my novel.

05:14.260 --> 05:16.561
Physical time travel
is an impossibility.

05:16.629 --> 05:19.030
Okay, so...
It's not a time machine.

05:19.098 --> 05:21.432
It's a temporal
consciousness transfer engine--

05:21.500 --> 05:23.334
a means to traverse
the space/time continuum

05:23.402 --> 05:24.869
using one's mind.

05:24.937 --> 05:27.472
So it <i>is</i> a time machine.
Not exactly.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.841
I'd become intrigued
by the idea of Gestalt,

05:29.909 --> 05:31.509
the collective unconscious.

05:31.577 --> 05:33.545
What if one were able
to connect with

05:33.612 --> 05:35.246
the mind of someone
who lived centuries ago?

05:35.314 --> 05:36.714
It happens randomly
in nature.

05:36.782 --> 05:38.783
Past life experience.

05:38.851 --> 05:40.351
Oh, right, right.

05:40.419 --> 05:44.489
Like Russell Crowe was a
Tasmanian convict in the 1800s.

05:44.557 --> 05:45.690
I read it online.

05:45.758 --> 05:47.058
My machine allows your mind

05:47.126 --> 05:48.860
to inhabit the body
of someone in the past,

05:48.928 --> 05:51.663
see what they see,
feel what they feel.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.865
Live a day in history.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.166
And you've done it.

05:55.234 --> 05:57.001
You've actually traveled
through time?

05:57.069 --> 05:59.504
God, that must have
been so awesome.

05:59.572 --> 06:02.040
No, not really.

06:02.107 --> 06:05.777
Okay, so what about
the person, you know, possessed?

06:05.845 --> 06:07.278
They black out.

06:07.346 --> 06:09.848
For 22 hours and 19 minutes.

06:09.915 --> 06:12.450
That's how long the trip lasts.
Never could work out why.

06:12.518 --> 06:16.254
Are you saying that someone
used or will use this machine

06:16.322 --> 06:18.857
to inhabit Jack and me
in 1961?

06:18.924 --> 06:20.725
That would explain
your losing time.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.861
Hey, this doesn't look like
it belongs here.

06:24.930 --> 06:28.766
Might wanna take
a look at this.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.201
"Dear Charlie,
do me a favor

06:30.269 --> 06:32.704
"and put this in the H.G. Wells
storage area.

06:32.771 --> 06:35.139
"I won't ask about it.
Don't bring it up.

06:35.207 --> 06:36.975
Trust me. Jack."

06:37.042 --> 06:39.244
That's not Jack's handwriting.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.212
I know.
It's mine.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.948
Hey, I-I'm ready.

06:44.016 --> 06:47.218
Yeah, uh, listen, you don't
really have to tag along.

06:47.286 --> 06:48.620
I know.
I just thought it would be nice

06:48.687 --> 06:50.588
if we could spend
some time together.

06:50.656 --> 06:51.956
Maybe after we find
the artifact,

06:52.024 --> 06:53.725
go for dinner and a movie.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.060
Really?
No!

06:56.128 --> 06:58.596
Is this really
how it's gonna be?

06:58.664 --> 07:00.298
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:00.366 --> 07:01.933
You can't keep
freezing me out

07:02.001 --> 07:04.402
because I supported Helena
joining the Warehouse.

07:04.470 --> 07:06.504
Oh, it's Helena, now, is it?
If it's all right with you,

07:06.572 --> 07:07.805
I'll just keep calling her
the villain.

07:07.873 --> 07:09.040
Artie,
you're being childish.

07:09.108 --> 07:10.675
Do you know what it takes
to keep

07:10.743 --> 07:13.211
a Warehouse Agent alive,
Myka?

07:13.279 --> 07:15.246
Trusting the Agent beside you
has your back.

07:15.314 --> 07:17.582
I couldn't trust MacPherson,
could I--could I?

07:17.650 --> 07:19.684
He's the one
who let H.G. out.

07:19.752 --> 07:21.419
How the hell
am I supposed to trust her?

07:21.487 --> 07:23.354
Helena has proven
more than once

07:23.422 --> 07:24.856
that she has my back.

07:24.924 --> 07:26.925
I thought I'd proven
that I had yours.

07:26.992 --> 07:28.326
You know what,
on second thought,

07:28.394 --> 07:31.496
I'll just handle this one
on my own.

07:35.734 --> 07:37.936
So...Artie decided to

07:38.003 --> 07:40.071
check out Raitt's apartment

07:40.139 --> 07:42.373
on...His own.

07:42.441 --> 07:44.042
What?

07:44.109 --> 07:46.244
I know this is
gonna sound nuts.

07:46.312 --> 07:48.046
I'm sure you're sitting there,
arms folded,

07:48.113 --> 07:49.380
twirling your hair,
biting your lip,

07:49.448 --> 07:51.582
not wanting to believe this,

07:51.650 --> 07:53.785
but...I'm you.

07:53.852 --> 07:55.253
I'm Myka.
Inside Rebecca.

07:55.321 --> 07:57.255
Well, your mind, anyway.

07:57.323 --> 07:59.390
We traveled back through time.

07:59.458 --> 08:00.658
I'm Pete.
Hi, Pete!

08:00.726 --> 08:03.127
Hi, me.
I can't believe this...

08:03.195 --> 08:04.662
This--this isn't possible.

08:04.730 --> 08:07.665
We don't have a lot of time.
Can you be serious?

08:07.733 --> 08:10.068
Don't give Rebecca back her
body all tensed up like that.

08:10.135 --> 08:11.302
Pete. Focus.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.937
Yoink! It is you guys.

08:13.005 --> 08:14.172
Listen, Myka.

08:14.239 --> 08:15.707
Pete is gonna try
to convince you

08:15.774 --> 08:17.942
to use the time machine
to travel back to 1961

08:18.010 --> 08:19.811
to identify an artifact.

08:19.878 --> 08:22.347
It's okay--Pete's actually
right for a change.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.315
And Pete.

08:24.383 --> 08:26.985
Get your ass to mars.

08:27.052 --> 08:29.287
Get your ass to Mars!

08:29.355 --> 08:30.755
Like <i>Total Recall!</i>

08:30.823 --> 08:32.323
Oh, I love that!

08:32.390 --> 08:34.158
Okay, we're done.

08:34.226 --> 08:35.626
There's one last thing
you need to know

08:35.693 --> 08:36.794
before you get here.

08:36.861 --> 08:38.563
The artifact is--

08:39.898 --> 08:41.532
Ohh...

08:43.501 --> 08:44.802
Hey, are you okay?

08:44.870 --> 08:47.171
It's just seeing Jack
again.

08:48.941 --> 08:51.943
Um...Well, what about
the butterfly effect?

08:52.011 --> 08:53.878
You know, when you step
on a butterfly in the past,

08:53.946 --> 08:56.147
it changes the whole future.

08:56.215 --> 08:57.915
No. I tried to change
the past.

08:57.983 --> 08:59.283
I failed.

08:59.351 --> 09:00.752
Look, it'll be strictly
recon, right?

09:00.819 --> 09:02.587
We'll go back,
get eyes on the artifact,

09:02.654 --> 09:03.955
and track it
in the here and now.

09:04.023 --> 09:06.290
Maybe we should
wait for Artie.

09:06.358 --> 09:07.892
Every moment you wait,

09:07.960 --> 09:09.961
it risks another person's
life in the present.

09:14.099 --> 09:15.633
Well, I did tell me
to do it.

09:15.701 --> 09:17.168
Oh, sweet.

09:17.236 --> 09:19.203
Pete and Myka's
excellent adventure!

09:23.675 --> 09:25.443
It's funny.

09:25.511 --> 09:29.180
It was after this case
that Jack and I fell in love.

09:29.248 --> 09:31.716
It was the day
we blacked out.

09:31.784 --> 09:34.752
I woke up in an orchard,
and Jack was kissing me.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.254
Our first kiss.

09:36.321 --> 09:37.989
I was so surprised.

09:38.057 --> 09:40.725
I mean,
I always fancied him,

09:40.793 --> 09:43.428
but he was always
so mean to me.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.762
All right.

09:44.830 --> 09:46.798
I hooked up the machine
to the main power grid.

09:46.865 --> 09:49.700
That's definitely enough juice
for it to run the full day.

09:49.768 --> 09:51.869
Whoa, wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

09:51.937 --> 09:53.404
Out of curiosity,
what happens to us

09:53.472 --> 09:55.907
if Jack and Rebecca bite it
while we're inside their bodies?

09:55.974 --> 09:56.974
Hoping not.

09:57.042 --> 09:58.576
I, uh, suspect

09:58.644 --> 10:01.145
your minds will be lost...
Forever.

10:03.315 --> 10:05.183
Hoping not!
Oh, good.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.251
Just making sure
it's as bad as I thought.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.524
I couldn't change
the past,

10:13.592 --> 10:15.693
but maybe you can.

10:20.265 --> 10:22.433
So is there
a big countdown?

10:22.501 --> 10:24.535
Uh...No.

10:59.271 --> 11:00.505
The time machine
set us on fire!

11:00.572 --> 11:02.540
The time machine set us
on fire!

11:02.608 --> 11:04.442
Eew.
Pete!

11:04.510 --> 11:07.044
Pete, it's okay.
It's okay. Look.

11:10.182 --> 11:12.183
âª âª

11:14.686 --> 11:17.021
Heh! We're in 1961.
Uh-huh.

11:20.325 --> 11:22.693
Myka.
Check it out.

11:22.761 --> 11:24.729
We're...

11:24.796 --> 11:27.265
Jack and Rebecca.

11:27.332 --> 11:31.302
I was gonna say still hot,
but, yes, that, too.

11:33.972 --> 11:35.373
My God.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.788
Are we done fixing
our hair and makeup, ladies?

11:54.856 --> 11:57.023
Who's the old goat?
Charlie Martin.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.592
He's their Artie.

11:58.659 --> 12:00.193
You think this is a good
place to catch 40 winks?

12:00.261 --> 12:02.762
Uh...No, sir.
No, uh...

12:02.830 --> 12:05.332
Y-you're right, Charlie.
It's not her fault.

12:05.399 --> 12:07.534
You see, I-I had kind of
a thing there and...

12:07.602 --> 12:09.402
Don't blame him, really.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.271
It's a rough morning
for both of us.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.640
Sorry, Rebecca.

12:13.708 --> 12:15.141
Rough morning.

12:15.209 --> 12:17.511
Maybe you should take
the rest of the day off.

12:17.578 --> 12:19.479
Or maybe
you should get back to work?

12:19.547 --> 12:21.781
We're very sorry,
Mr. Martin, sir.

12:21.849 --> 12:23.550
We'll just get
back to work.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.052
Yes. We're sorry.
Sir. Thank you.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.154
Sir?

12:28.222 --> 12:30.123
Mr. Martin.

12:30.191 --> 12:31.958
What is this?
What's goin' on?

12:32.026 --> 12:33.426
You two don't cover
for each other.

12:33.494 --> 12:34.961
You're mean to each other.

12:35.029 --> 12:37.097
What gives?
Uh...

12:37.164 --> 12:38.965
Y-yes.
Right!

12:39.033 --> 12:40.233
The meanness...

12:40.301 --> 12:41.968
Jerk!

12:42.036 --> 12:44.237
We have for each other...
Hate...

12:44.305 --> 12:45.238
You.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.674
I need you in Calcutta.

12:47.742 --> 12:49.743
You're off
the glass girl case.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.044
Wait a minute, what?
What?

12:51.112 --> 12:52.345
What do you mean?
Not a discussion.

12:52.413 --> 12:54.114
Gus is getting close
to Man Ray's camera.

12:54.181 --> 12:55.549
I need you on that.

12:55.616 --> 12:59.586
Another glass girl turns up,
we'll get back into it.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.722
Look...This comes directly
from Mrs. Frederic,

13:02.790 --> 13:04.558
so if you wanna piss her off

13:04.625 --> 13:06.693
and have her give you
that stare, go ahead.

13:06.761 --> 13:09.195
Lady terrifies <i>me.</i>

13:09.263 --> 13:11.164
Look, Charlie,
all we need is one more day.

13:11.232 --> 13:13.400
I've already got a job lined up
at the magazine,

13:13.467 --> 13:15.368
and Jack is going to talk
to Raitt's wife.

13:15.436 --> 13:17.003
I am?
Yes. It was in Rebecca's

13:17.071 --> 13:20.574
my...
My file.

13:20.641 --> 13:22.776
If we don't find anything,
then...Calcutta.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.678
Fine. 24 hours.

13:24.745 --> 13:26.279
No more.

13:28.883 --> 13:30.216
Oh, Charlie,
we're gonna need

13:30.284 --> 13:33.119
everything that you can
find on Jonah Raitt.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.854
Of course, Rebecca.
Anything you need.

13:34.922 --> 13:37.924
After all,
I'm your secretary, right?

13:39.927 --> 13:43.530
I really don't like him.
He's a bit of a sphincter.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.436
I'm gonna go interview
Raitt's wife.

13:49.503 --> 13:53.373
I'll meet you back here
at the magazine, okay?

13:53.441 --> 13:55.075
Un...Believable.

13:55.142 --> 13:56.576
I know.

13:56.644 --> 13:59.279
Steaks for a dollar!

13:59.347 --> 14:01.715
No, no.
I mean the--

14:01.782 --> 14:03.016
no, no, no,
I know what you mean,

14:03.084 --> 14:05.986
but...A dollar!

14:06.053 --> 14:08.755
What--hey, hey--

14:08.823 --> 14:10.023
what?

14:10.091 --> 14:12.092
I want you to be
careful in there, okay?

14:12.159 --> 14:13.460
If he's got an artifact
in his office,

14:13.527 --> 14:14.461
just get eyes on it.

14:14.528 --> 14:16.062
Don't engage.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.031
He's obviously a nut bar.
I'll be fine.

14:18.099 --> 14:20.033
When you talk to Raitt's wife,

14:20.101 --> 14:22.469
just remember it's 1961,
okay?

14:22.536 --> 14:24.537
Women slap men
when they get fresh.

14:25.873 --> 14:27.807
Huh? What?

14:30.945 --> 14:33.246
âª âª

14:36.183 --> 14:39.986
âª âª

14:40.054 --> 14:42.422
I am a capable...Woman.

14:43.958 --> 14:45.659
You are just...
A tape recorder!

14:48.095 --> 14:52.032
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no!

14:54.468 --> 14:56.803
First day?
Yeah.

15:01.575 --> 15:02.909
Roxanne.

15:02.977 --> 15:04.811
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Raitt.

15:04.879 --> 15:06.579
The Secret Service!

15:06.647 --> 15:08.381
That must be so exciting.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.950
Well...It has its moments.

15:11.018 --> 15:12.385
Well, if the President's
coming,

15:12.453 --> 15:13.920
it's a good thing
you're making sure

15:13.988 --> 15:15.188
the neighborhood is safe.

15:15.256 --> 15:18.358
It's just a precaution.

15:20.494 --> 15:22.629
Isn't that true?

15:22.697 --> 15:24.130
You know,
we voted for him.

15:24.198 --> 15:27.200
There was something about
that Nixon I just didn't trust.

15:27.268 --> 15:28.134
Good call.

15:29.937 --> 15:32.906
Uh...So...Is there
anything new around here,

15:32.973 --> 15:35.675
something your husband may have
brought home from the...

15:35.743 --> 15:37.577
Office?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.312
He killed
his three secretaries.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.815
And his wife.

15:41.882 --> 15:44.284
Are you all right?

15:44.351 --> 15:45.318
I mean...

15:45.386 --> 15:48.388
Yes, ma'am.

15:48.456 --> 15:50.557
The four women
were murdered cruelly

15:50.624 --> 15:52.425
in an unnatural way.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.662
I just, uh,
had a feeling.

15:55.730 --> 15:58.531
You look so happy
in that photo.

15:58.599 --> 16:00.800
Agent Secord,

16:00.868 --> 16:02.001
does the President
have reason

16:02.069 --> 16:03.570
to be concerned about
my marriage?

16:03.637 --> 16:05.972
No. No, ma'am.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.240
No reason.

16:07.308 --> 16:08.875
Mm.

16:14.582 --> 16:15.882
Thank you so much.

16:15.950 --> 16:17.917
You know, I really
like your bracelet.

16:17.985 --> 16:19.719
Thanks.
It was a gift.

16:19.787 --> 16:21.955
From who?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.724
Was there someone
that you're, you know--

16:24.792 --> 16:26.693
ladies.

16:26.761 --> 16:28.762
This is a place of business.

16:30.164 --> 16:32.031
Not a sewing circle.

16:32.099 --> 16:33.800
Certainly, Mr. Raitt.

16:58.859 --> 17:00.460
How can you tell if...

17:03.664 --> 17:05.665
Oh, uh...Ahem.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.700
It, uh...

17:07.768 --> 17:09.135
Uses a--a lot of power.

17:09.203 --> 17:11.471
But don't worry.
The Warehouse can take it.

17:11.539 --> 17:13.439
It's not the Warehouse
I'm worried about.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.509
I hate this.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.578
When I was talking to Beth,
I kept thinking,

17:18.646 --> 17:20.713
"you have no idea
that you're gonna die today."

17:20.781 --> 17:22.582
Today!
I mean, how is that fair?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.349
It's not.
Rebecca.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.051
You seem to have gotten
the hang of that dictation.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.954
You're practically
a natural.

17:28.021 --> 17:30.190
Oh, no, not really.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.724
I'm going to be leaving
for the day.

17:31.792 --> 17:33.359
Good night, Roxanne.
I'll see <i>you</i> in the morning.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.161
Yes.

17:35.229 --> 17:38.164
In the morning.
Have a good night, Mr. Raitt.

17:38.232 --> 17:41.701
Well, I should probably...
Call it a night.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.803
Good night.

17:46.006 --> 17:48.875
She's lying.
They both are.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.810
They're obviously
meeting up tonight.

17:50.878 --> 17:53.246
Do people not know
how to lie in 1961?

17:53.314 --> 17:55.014
That's <i>the</i> Roxanne,
the next victim.

17:55.082 --> 17:56.482
We can't think of her
like that.

17:56.550 --> 17:57.750
How can we not?

17:57.818 --> 18:00.220
That guy is gonna kill her
and his wife.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.554
There's nothing
that we can do.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.189
Recon only the timeline.

18:03.257 --> 18:06.226
Screw the timeline, okay?
I'm going after Raitt.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.161
You stay here
and search his office.

18:08.229 --> 18:10.530
Maybe he stashed the artifact.
Pete, no, you can't--

18:10.598 --> 18:11.965
sweetheart,
I am gonna need these

18:12.032 --> 18:14.834
collated and filed
by the end of business today.

18:14.902 --> 18:16.569
Thanks, honey.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.538
Honey? Sweetheart?
Listen, bub, I--

18:18.606 --> 18:19.439
Pete?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.450
There. That oughta be
enough to stabilize it,

18:30.517 --> 18:31.985
at least until
the fluctuations--

18:32.052 --> 18:33.152
Claudia...

18:33.220 --> 18:34.387
What's this?

18:34.455 --> 18:35.488
Artie!

18:35.556 --> 18:37.123
Hey.

18:37.191 --> 18:39.425
What are you doin' here?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.728
There was nothing
at Raitt's apartment.

18:41.795 --> 18:43.763
What are you doing here?

18:43.831 --> 18:47.433
Well, we had a--
a power...Issue.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.802
Uh, 'cause of the--

18:49.870 --> 18:51.804
It's a funny story.

18:53.307 --> 18:54.841
Oh, God.
What happened?

18:54.909 --> 18:56.109
Are you all right?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.511
Yes, yes, I'm...Fine.

18:58.579 --> 18:59.879
Just a little bit dizzy.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.114
Hold on.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.615
I'll get you some water,
all right?

19:05.619 --> 19:07.420
Nice work, Miss Streep.

19:07.488 --> 19:10.590
Next time
Let's try it with an accent.

19:10.658 --> 19:13.459
I just...
Didn't want Artie to--

19:13.527 --> 19:15.695
oh!

19:24.377 --> 19:26.812
âª âª

19:27.922 --> 19:29.556
Martini,
Mr. McNamara.

19:29.624 --> 19:30.790
Thank you.

19:30.858 --> 19:32.325
And what can I get
for you, sir?

19:43.004 --> 19:45.171
Hey.

19:45.239 --> 19:47.440
Jackie O, huh?

19:48.976 --> 19:49.909
Who?

19:49.977 --> 19:51.745
Uh...

19:51.812 --> 19:52.912
Jackie Kennedy.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.547
I mean like...
Oh, wow.

19:54.615 --> 19:57.517
She's...Foxy.
W-what do you got there?

19:57.585 --> 19:58.818
I mean, look at this.

19:58.886 --> 20:00.587
This is a relic.

20:00.655 --> 20:02.355
This stuff was outdated
in the '50s.

20:02.423 --> 20:05.859
Yeah, I'm more of
a <i>Sports Illustrated</i> guy myself.

20:05.926 --> 20:07.927
Better, yeah.

20:07.995 --> 20:09.396
'Course, if you ask me,

20:09.463 --> 20:11.297
they could stand
to spice things up a little bit.

20:11.365 --> 20:13.033
Add a little cheesecake.

20:14.301 --> 20:16.102
Maybe have a Swimsuit Issue.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.004
Got an eye
for the ladies, huh?

20:18.072 --> 20:20.106
I do.

20:20.174 --> 20:22.175
You know, they say that God
made us in his image.

20:22.243 --> 20:25.412
It makes me think
that God must be a woman.

20:27.715 --> 20:29.783
I mean, look at her.

20:29.850 --> 20:32.252
She's stunning, right?

20:32.319 --> 20:34.688
But this magazine,
it does its best

20:34.755 --> 20:38.158
to make her seem dull.

20:38.225 --> 20:42.896
She should be admired
like a work of art.

20:46.701 --> 20:48.401
Go back to Pete and Myka.

20:48.469 --> 20:50.937
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.609
No more sniffin' glue,
young Lady.

21:00.214 --> 21:02.682
Uh, Rebecca,

21:02.750 --> 21:04.451
I'm sorry.

21:04.518 --> 21:05.985
Don't be sorry.

21:06.053 --> 21:08.188
Just a little bit...Too much
excitement for this old gal.

21:11.492 --> 21:13.860
It's very ungentlemanly
to rifle through

21:13.928 --> 21:16.029
a Lady's handbag.

21:16.097 --> 21:17.764
Well, when you collapsed,
I wanted to check

21:17.832 --> 21:19.866
to see if you were taking
any medication,

21:19.934 --> 21:22.435
and I had to look up,
uh...Erlopa.

21:22.503 --> 21:25.105
Erlotinib.

21:25.172 --> 21:26.639
You know, in a way,
I'm lucky.

21:26.707 --> 21:29.175
Most Warehouse agents
don't usually live long enough

21:29.243 --> 21:31.177
to die of cancer.

21:31.245 --> 21:34.547
What kind of a...
Prognosis...

21:34.615 --> 21:36.249
Grim.

21:36.317 --> 21:39.352
And that's optimistic.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.387
You know, I always said...

21:41.455 --> 21:45.091
I'd find that artifact
if it was the last thing I did.

21:45.159 --> 21:47.026
Rebecca.

21:47.094 --> 21:48.828
We'll find it.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.869
It was nice
talking to you.

21:55.936 --> 21:57.270
You too.

22:12.353 --> 22:14.020
Cigarettes, sir?

22:14.088 --> 22:16.990
Uh, no thanks.

22:17.057 --> 22:18.258
Myka.
Hello.

22:18.325 --> 22:19.425
What are you doing here?

22:19.493 --> 22:20.527
This is a gentleman's
only club.

22:20.594 --> 22:21.795
Well, interestingly
enough,

22:21.862 --> 22:23.696
if you're wearing
one of these outfits,

22:23.764 --> 22:26.065
nobody bothers
to look at your face.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.500
Look, don't try and talk me
out of this, okay?

22:27.568 --> 22:28.902
Raitt's our guy.

22:28.969 --> 22:30.770
He's been talking about
turning women into art.

22:30.838 --> 22:31.871
Pete--

22:31.939 --> 22:34.174
oh, great.
He's gone.

22:34.241 --> 22:35.842
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.944
Do you know where
Jonah Raitt went?

22:38.012 --> 22:40.246
I'm sorry, sir.
He just drove off.

22:40.314 --> 22:41.981
Damn it!

22:42.049 --> 22:44.017
Good work, Myka.
Forget trying to stop him.

22:44.084 --> 22:45.652
How are we supposed to I.D.
the artifact now?

22:45.719 --> 22:47.220
Gimme the Farnsworth.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.524
So nice of both of you
to check in.

22:51.592 --> 22:53.059
I'm touched.

22:53.127 --> 22:54.627
You need
to quit smokin', man.

22:54.695 --> 22:56.629
Charlie, did you get
any of that information on Raitt

22:56.697 --> 22:57.931
I asked you for?

22:57.998 --> 23:00.033
It was the highlight
of my day.

23:00.100 --> 23:02.035
Well, were there any
hotel receipts?

23:02.102 --> 23:04.370
What? Hotel?
Oh, right!

23:04.438 --> 23:06.706
'Cause if the dude's stepping
out on his wife, then--

23:06.774 --> 23:07.774
he's not inviting them
home.

23:07.842 --> 23:09.275
Wrong again, Rebecca.

23:09.343 --> 23:11.811
He is inviting them home.
Wait--come again?

23:11.879 --> 23:13.346
Raitt took a deduction
last year

23:13.414 --> 23:15.548
on a second residence,

23:15.616 --> 23:18.084
a one-bedroom
at 15 Hoover Street.

23:18.152 --> 23:20.253
Must be a side pad

23:20.321 --> 23:23.056
where he engages in sexual
congress with his secretaries.

23:23.123 --> 23:25.925
And Rebecca...
Nice catch.

23:27.862 --> 23:29.762
You're teacher's pet
in every decade, aren't ya?

23:29.830 --> 23:31.898
The file said that Roxanne
was killed on Hoover Street.

23:31.966 --> 23:33.566
Let's go.

23:35.469 --> 23:38.304
She's gonna be fine,
Claudia.

23:38.372 --> 23:40.373
I assure you.

23:40.441 --> 23:42.542
So where'd you go when
you used your time machine?

23:42.610 --> 23:45.345
Uh...Mani-pedis
with Cleopatra?

23:45.412 --> 23:47.981
Snog with Casanova?

23:48.048 --> 23:50.283
Paris, 1899.

23:50.351 --> 23:53.019
Why?

23:53.087 --> 23:55.755
That's, um...That's where
I'd arranged for

23:55.823 --> 23:58.191
my daughter Christina to spend
the summer with cousins.

23:58.259 --> 24:00.059
I was away a great deal.

24:00.127 --> 24:01.928
Single working mother,
to use today's parlance.

24:01.996 --> 24:04.797
One day, Christina
awoke with a fever.

24:04.865 --> 24:07.834
Sophie, the housekeeper,
had her stay in bed.

24:07.902 --> 24:10.837
The men who came to rob
my cousins' home

24:10.905 --> 24:12.972
were expecting
an empty house.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.242
Sophie tried to fight them,
but there were too many.

24:16.310 --> 24:18.645
She survived, but, um,

24:18.712 --> 24:20.413
Christina...

24:23.651 --> 24:28.187
Sophie had no recollection
of the 22 hours and 19 minutes

24:28.255 --> 24:30.523
during which
the incident occurred.

24:30.591 --> 24:33.293
And when one of the thieves
was finally captured,

24:33.360 --> 24:36.262
he described
how Sophie had fought...

24:36.330 --> 24:39.732
Using Kempo, a fighting style
that I favored.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.769
And I began to suspect--
I-I knew, I just knew

24:42.836 --> 24:46.339
that somehow I had traveled
back in time and become Sophie.

24:46.407 --> 24:49.142
Eventually,
I constructed the machine,

24:49.209 --> 24:53.079
determined to alter
the course of events.

24:53.147 --> 24:55.648
But the ink with which
are lives are inscribed

24:55.716 --> 24:57.050
is indelible.

24:59.553 --> 25:01.087
I imagine...

25:01.155 --> 25:04.791
Losing a child is the worst
pain a person can go through.

25:04.858 --> 25:06.526
No, actually.

25:08.629 --> 25:11.497
When I tracked them down,

25:11.565 --> 25:17.103
what I did to the men
who killed my daughter...

25:17.171 --> 25:20.206
That's the most pain
a person can go through.

25:38.092 --> 25:39.692
Roxanne!
Oh!

25:39.760 --> 25:41.594
Jeepers!
You scared the life out of me!

25:41.662 --> 25:43.363
Roxanne, you're in danger.

25:43.430 --> 25:45.231
Danger. Ha.

25:45.299 --> 25:47.400
Rebecca,
what are you doing here?

25:47.468 --> 25:49.402
We know what's going on
between you and Raitt.

25:49.470 --> 25:52.171
I have to go.
No, listen to me!

25:52.239 --> 25:55.208
Pete, Pete, look at me.
Just don't do this.

25:55.275 --> 25:57.243
I'm not gonna
let her die, Myka.

25:57.311 --> 26:00.380
Pete!
You know you can't stop this.

26:02.549 --> 26:05.118
Roxanne, wait!

26:12.092 --> 26:14.127
What are you doing here?

26:14.194 --> 26:16.029
No!

26:16.096 --> 26:17.730
Oh!

26:23.537 --> 26:26.439
No!

26:43.924 --> 26:45.491
I know you.

26:45.559 --> 26:47.326
You were at the club.

26:47.394 --> 26:49.262
What are you,
following me?

26:51.965 --> 26:52.899
My God.

26:52.966 --> 26:55.435
That's Roxanne's bracelet.

26:55.502 --> 26:56.903
What happened?

26:56.970 --> 26:59.038
We can't explain this,
but...

26:59.106 --> 27:02.141
She's dead.
We're sorry.

27:02.209 --> 27:05.078
It's not him.
Raitt's not our guy.

27:05.145 --> 27:08.014
And we don't have much time
to find out who is.

27:09.550 --> 27:12.385
All right, the first thing
that we need to do

27:12.453 --> 27:15.455
is reanalyze the data.

27:15.522 --> 27:18.257
Ha. This place
still does that, huh?

27:18.325 --> 27:19.358
Yeah...

27:21.161 --> 27:23.696
Artie...
What are you doing?

27:26.667 --> 27:29.669
There's a power clot in one of
the secure storage sectors.

27:29.736 --> 27:31.537
It's probably nothing.
I'll flush it out,

27:31.605 --> 27:33.506
send down a micro-pulse.
Artie, no!

27:38.078 --> 27:41.948
Oh!

27:42.015 --> 27:44.484
Connection's holding,
but something just completely

27:44.551 --> 27:46.953
burnt out
the reintegration wiring.

27:47.020 --> 27:50.723
Which means what?
I can't bring them back.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.391
When Jack and Rebecca awaken,

27:52.459 --> 27:54.093
Pete and Myka
will be lost forever.

28:01.569 --> 28:04.738
The power level's dropping.
Well, it's overheating!

28:04.806 --> 28:06.173
We--we need something
to cool it down.

28:06.241 --> 28:07.741
On it!

28:09.143 --> 28:12.012
Whatever you're doing
to my people,

28:12.080 --> 28:13.614
it stops now.

28:13.681 --> 28:16.016
Ah!
Myka. Myka, you okay?

28:16.084 --> 28:17.251
Oh, God.
What the hell was that?

28:17.318 --> 28:18.819
I don't know.

28:18.887 --> 28:21.455
D-do you think something
went wrong?

28:21.522 --> 28:23.056
Oh, Roxanne...

28:23.124 --> 28:26.059
What did this?

28:26.127 --> 28:28.061
Look, Raitt...

28:28.129 --> 28:29.563
You need to tell us
what you know.

28:29.631 --> 28:31.164
Who would want to hurt them?

28:31.232 --> 28:34.268
I don't know, I don't know
if something like this--

28:36.571 --> 28:38.505
what do you mean, them?
Meredith and Ruth,

28:38.573 --> 28:40.874
the two other women
who worked for your company.

28:40.942 --> 28:42.209
No, I-I got a note from them.

28:42.277 --> 28:43.877
They're in Los Angeles
for research.

28:43.945 --> 28:46.546
They never left that note.

28:46.614 --> 28:48.348
S-so this...

28:48.416 --> 28:50.651
This happened to them too.

28:50.718 --> 28:51.919
Look, I know
this is a shock,

28:51.986 --> 28:53.420
but you were sleeping
with these women.

28:53.488 --> 28:55.289
Now, who would want
to hurt them?

28:55.356 --> 28:56.723
I wasn't sleeping
with them!

28:56.791 --> 28:58.659
I was trying to take over
the magazine!

28:58.726 --> 29:02.229
I was trying to get rid
of the publisher

29:02.297 --> 29:04.298
and take control of
<i>Where & When</i> myself.

29:04.365 --> 29:08.368
It needs artistic vision
and independent thinking.

29:08.436 --> 29:10.270
So they were...
Helping you?

29:10.338 --> 29:12.205
Yeah.

29:12.273 --> 29:14.975
They're completely undervalued
by that company...

29:15.043 --> 29:18.345
And capable of so much more.

29:18.413 --> 29:21.548
You think someone found out,
was trying to stop us?

29:21.616 --> 29:23.650
No, no, but we need
to get to Beth.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.886
We think she might be next.
My wife?

29:25.954 --> 29:28.055
Well, she has nothing
to do with this.

29:28.122 --> 29:29.756
How do you even know that?
I can't tell you.

29:29.824 --> 29:31.425
But just trust me.
We've got to get there now!

29:31.492 --> 29:34.261
If they touch my wife,
I swear to God...

29:36.731 --> 29:39.266
Artie.
What are you doing?

29:39.334 --> 29:41.201
She's killing them.
I tried to explain

29:41.269 --> 29:43.036
that this is a form
of time travel!

29:43.104 --> 29:45.339
Time travel's
a physical impossibility.

29:45.406 --> 29:47.074
No, we know.
This works on your mind.

29:47.141 --> 29:49.376
So does she.
Archie pulsed the system.

29:49.444 --> 29:50.577
That's what burned out
the wiring.

29:50.645 --> 29:51.712
I wouldn't have pulsed
the system

29:51.779 --> 29:53.380
if I knew
what you were doing.

29:53.448 --> 29:55.148
If we'd have asked,
you'd have said no!

29:55.216 --> 29:56.917
You bet your ass
I would have said no!

29:59.253 --> 30:01.288
Claudia, this is not your fault.
You see the best in people--

30:01.356 --> 30:03.123
people like her take advantage
of people like you.

30:03.191 --> 30:05.192
I'm not quite so naive.

30:05.259 --> 30:07.961
Am I naive?

30:08.029 --> 30:10.364
I asked them to do this.

30:10.431 --> 30:12.499
If you're gonna shoot
the one responsible,

30:12.567 --> 30:14.768
fire away.

30:18.639 --> 30:20.173
I-I-f we don't fix this...

30:20.241 --> 30:22.109
We'll lose them.

30:22.176 --> 30:24.444
They'll die.

30:27.982 --> 30:29.983
Stand over me.
Watch my every move.

30:31.953 --> 30:33.487
But let me save them.

30:42.530 --> 30:44.331
And if they die...

30:44.399 --> 30:46.199
I won't bother
rebronzing you.

30:50.371 --> 30:51.538
What do you need?

30:51.606 --> 30:53.140
I need a power source.
Quickly.

30:55.910 --> 30:58.912
Beth?
Beth, are you here?

30:58.980 --> 31:00.647
Look, don't worry.
We'll find her.

31:00.715 --> 31:03.917
Pete--I mean...I mean Jack
is looking outside.

31:03.985 --> 31:06.853
If she's not here,
that's good, right?

31:06.921 --> 31:08.688
Why is that good, Jonah?

31:08.756 --> 31:11.224
Oh, my God.
My God, you're all right.

31:11.292 --> 31:12.959
We were so worried
about you.

31:13.027 --> 31:14.494
You shouldn't be.

31:14.562 --> 31:16.897
I tried to make it so you'd
never have to worry, ever,

31:16.964 --> 31:18.932
and we'd always be okay.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.467
Listen, Beth,
there's a terrible thing

31:20.535 --> 31:22.002
that's happened.

31:22.070 --> 31:24.137
Meredith, Ruth,
and Roxanne have been killed.

31:24.205 --> 31:26.373
Hmm. So...
You went right out

31:26.441 --> 31:29.509
and got yourself
another whore.

31:29.577 --> 31:30.777
What?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.179
I took care of the others.

31:32.246 --> 31:34.581
And you just bring
another one around?

31:34.649 --> 31:35.949
You killed those women.

31:36.017 --> 31:38.318
I'd hope
you'd get the message.

31:38.386 --> 31:39.753
Maybe I should have
been more obvious.

31:39.821 --> 31:41.721
Jonah!

31:41.789 --> 31:43.924
Look, Beth, there's gotta
be another way, okay?

31:43.991 --> 31:45.826
Well, maybe there's been...

31:45.893 --> 31:48.462
I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

31:48.529 --> 31:50.097
You shoot your little
Ray gun there

31:50.164 --> 31:51.465
and hit my husband.

31:51.532 --> 31:53.066
That's all I need
to understand.

31:53.134 --> 31:55.368
Maybe not all.

31:56.804 --> 31:58.171
Aah!
Pete!

32:00.875 --> 32:03.176
No! It has to stay in!

32:06.347 --> 32:08.181
This is probably
gonna hurt!

32:08.249 --> 32:10.650
It already does...
A lot!

32:30.071 --> 32:31.571
Beth!

32:31.639 --> 32:33.707
Pete? Pete!

32:36.377 --> 32:37.711
Jonah.

32:40.381 --> 32:42.282
I wish you'd loved me more.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.687
Oh, baby.

32:52.393 --> 32:54.928
Those poor girls...

32:54.996 --> 32:57.998
I wish you'd loved me less.

33:41.988 --> 33:44.356
So this...This is why
we made that movie

33:44.424 --> 33:45.558
to send to ourselves.

33:45.569 --> 33:48.604
Because we knew we'd not only
get eyes on the artifact,

33:48.672 --> 33:50.506
but we'd actually snag it.

33:50.574 --> 33:51.741
Yeah, but we can't
take it back to the future,

33:51.809 --> 33:53.109
so what was the point?

33:53.177 --> 33:54.444
What if we could get it
back to the future?

33:54.511 --> 33:55.845
What if we could hide it

33:55.913 --> 33:58.381
somewhere we knew would exist
50 years from now,

33:58.449 --> 33:59.916
somewhere safe,

33:59.983 --> 34:01.751
somewhere where only we...
Could get to it.

34:01.819 --> 34:03.119
The Warehouse.

34:03.187 --> 34:04.887
But, Pete, we still need
to make that movie,

34:04.955 --> 34:06.556
and we're running
out of time.

34:06.623 --> 34:08.591
When are we not
running out of time?

34:08.659 --> 34:10.460
Well, where in the hell
are we gonna find a camera?

34:10.527 --> 34:11.627
Huh?

34:16.132 --> 34:19.869
99...Would you believe
the credenza?

34:44.228 --> 34:46.795
Jonah.

34:46.864 --> 34:49.398
I don't know how
to explain this, but, um...

34:49.466 --> 34:51.300
You've gotta run.

34:51.368 --> 34:53.803
Run? Why?

34:53.871 --> 34:56.339
Roxanne, the other women,
now your wife.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.007
You're the prime suspect.

34:58.075 --> 34:59.675
But you can tell the police
that it was Beth

34:59.743 --> 35:02.044
and that I'm innocent.
We can't.

35:02.112 --> 35:04.714
We won't be in town
long enough

35:04.782 --> 35:06.449
to tell anyone anything.
So where am I supposed to go?

35:06.517 --> 35:08.684
St. Louis.

35:08.752 --> 35:12.221
You have to trust me.
You'll be safe in St. Louis.

35:12.289 --> 35:14.524
And...

35:14.591 --> 35:16.225
We're sorry to have
to ask you this,

35:16.293 --> 35:17.460
but we need a favor.

35:17.528 --> 35:19.362
We need you to mail this movie.

35:19.429 --> 35:20.997
It will clear your name
some day.

35:21.064 --> 35:22.899
Trust us.

35:25.235 --> 35:27.937
Jonah?

35:28.005 --> 35:29.172
Good luck.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.618
We're not gonna have enough
time to get the knife back.

35:42.686 --> 35:44.520
How far are we
from the Warehouse?

35:44.588 --> 35:45.688
We can make it.

35:49.526 --> 35:50.660
They're not gonna make it.

35:50.727 --> 35:51.894
We're not gonna make it.

35:51.962 --> 35:53.162
We should have mailed
the knife too.

35:53.230 --> 35:54.730
Are you kidding me?

35:54.798 --> 35:56.966
Do you remember the last time
someone mailed an artifact?

35:57.034 --> 35:58.134
Oh, right.
Dr. Doomsday-a-gogo.

36:00.270 --> 36:02.038
Aah!

36:02.105 --> 36:03.940
Oh, God! Ah!

36:13.617 --> 36:15.451
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

36:15.519 --> 36:17.954
It's just the headaches
are getting worse.

36:18.021 --> 36:19.689
What if--

36:19.756 --> 36:21.090
what?

36:21.158 --> 36:23.125
Just a little bit
of history repeating.

36:26.730 --> 36:28.331
Rebecca said Jack kissed her
under a tree

36:28.398 --> 36:29.465
in a cherry orchard.

36:29.533 --> 36:30.933
This must be
where they woke up.

36:31.001 --> 36:32.869
We were coming here
all along.

36:32.936 --> 36:34.871
Should we just leave
the knife with Jack and Rebecca?

36:34.938 --> 36:36.272
Well, we can't.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.940
They won't know what it is
when they wake up.

36:38.008 --> 36:39.642
And they might think
it's a letter opener

36:39.710 --> 36:41.544
and glass themselves
paying the electric bill.

36:41.612 --> 36:43.446
Uh...How 'bout right here?
Okay.

36:47.251 --> 36:50.419
Here?
Yeah.

36:50.487 --> 36:52.822
We'll have just enough time
to get them back.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.790
If this works.

37:04.334 --> 37:05.635
The power's
not transferring.

37:05.702 --> 37:07.303
I don't know
what else to do.

37:07.371 --> 37:08.638
Pete, what are you doing?

37:08.705 --> 37:10.239
Rebecca spent her whole life
blaming herself

37:10.307 --> 37:11.641
because she couldn't
find the artifact.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.042
If I can tell her
where it is--

37:13.110 --> 37:14.543
Pete, it won't work.
It never works.

37:14.611 --> 37:17.246
The past can't change.
And neither can I.

37:17.314 --> 37:19.282
Back in the old days
when things didn't work...

37:19.349 --> 37:20.650
Yeah, mine too.
Works for me.

37:36.033 --> 37:38.100
Can't you see?
We have to keep trying.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.636
If we just accept fate,
then we're no better than--

38:11.501 --> 38:12.902
Are we back?

38:18.141 --> 38:20.109
Are we in deep doo doo?

38:20.177 --> 38:21.911
Oh, more than
you can imagine.

38:21.979 --> 38:24.880
Oh, no, no, man.
I dropped the note.

38:24.948 --> 38:27.283
You guys look...
Freaked out.

38:27.351 --> 38:28.918
Did--did something happen?

38:28.986 --> 38:30.653
No.

38:30.721 --> 38:33.122
Did you see the artifact?
Not only did we see it...

38:33.190 --> 38:34.824
We know where it is.

38:34.891 --> 38:36.993
It's safe.

38:37.060 --> 38:40.296
Were you able to save
any of those women?

38:42.165 --> 38:44.300
Well, I guess you can't
change the past...

38:44.368 --> 38:46.335
No matter
how hard you try.

38:47.971 --> 38:49.839
That machine...

38:52.709 --> 38:54.210
Does it still work?
Don't tell us

38:54.277 --> 38:56.145
you want us to go back
and get another artifact.

38:56.213 --> 38:58.147
No.

38:58.215 --> 39:01.617
But I would like to see
Jack again.

39:01.685 --> 39:03.019
One more time.

39:03.086 --> 39:05.955
Well, t-the circuitry's
severely damaged,

39:06.023 --> 39:10.059
and the trip wouldn't last
more than a few moments.

39:10.127 --> 39:12.495
And...I wouldn't be able
to bring you back.

39:15.499 --> 39:18.000
Why would I want
to come back?

40:05.189 --> 40:06.689
Hey.

40:06.757 --> 40:10.059
So, um, Pete recovered
the knife.

40:10.127 --> 40:12.328
Good. Turns out that artifact

40:12.396 --> 40:13.963
was the basis
of the Cinderella story.

40:14.031 --> 40:16.032
Only instead of
how in the story

40:16.100 --> 40:17.500
a young girl
meets a handsome prince

40:17.568 --> 40:19.269
who gives her
a glass slipper...

40:19.336 --> 40:21.971
Cinderella
used the knife to...

40:22.039 --> 40:24.307
Let's just say they tend to
reedit these things

40:24.375 --> 40:25.508
for children.

40:25.576 --> 40:28.144
We like things simple
when we're kids.

40:28.212 --> 40:30.480
Black and white,
good and evil.

40:30.548 --> 40:33.516
Sometimes I wish things
still were that simple.

40:33.584 --> 40:35.652
She did good, didn't she?

40:35.719 --> 40:37.687
Rebecca? Yeah.
She did real good.

40:37.755 --> 40:40.757
No, I meant, you know...

40:40.824 --> 40:42.025
Helena.

40:42.092 --> 40:44.527
Yeah.

40:44.595 --> 40:46.829
And so did you.

41:56.533 --> 41:57.500
Becs?

41:59.970 --> 42:01.704
Where the hell are we?

42:01.772 --> 42:04.040
It's okay.
We're all right.

42:04.108 --> 42:05.742
The last thing I remember,
uh...

42:05.809 --> 42:07.110
I was sitting
in the Warehouse and--

42:07.177 --> 42:08.778
it doesn't matter.

42:08.846 --> 42:11.648
Jack, I missed you so much.

42:11.715 --> 42:12.849
Missed me?

42:22.126 --> 42:24.627
Jack, what are you doing?

42:24.695 --> 42:27.597
What I should have done
a long time ago.

42:30.901 --> 42:33.836
Mm!
