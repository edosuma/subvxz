00:01.510 --> 00:05.116
<i>Back in 2009, your aunt Robin got
a job hosting a morning show.</i>

00:05.284 --> 00:07.203
<i>Which meant
she had to get up kind of early.</i>

00:07.328 --> 00:08.166
<i>How early?</i>

00:10.426 --> 00:11.764
Morning, everybody.

00:13.726 --> 00:15.295
So you're actually doing it?

00:15.419 --> 00:17.694
You're actually going to work
at 2:00 a.m.

00:17.863 --> 00:20.495
I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for the fans.

00:20.767 --> 00:23.838
Who exactly are the fans of a show
that airs at 4:00 in the morning?

00:24.453 --> 00:26.680
People getting up to host a show
at 5:00 in the morning?

00:27.267 --> 00:29.103
Meth addicts
who haven't sold their TVs yet?

00:30.020 --> 00:32.618
Strippers in that messy gray area
between getting off work

00:32.744 --> 00:34.573
and getting their kids
up for school?

00:34.699 --> 00:35.664
Them's my peeps.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.213
All right, catch me up.
What's been going on?

00:38.799 --> 00:40.546
You know, the yoozh.

00:41.223 --> 00:42.852
- Really, the yoozh?
- Yes.

00:43.291 --> 00:46.154
Robin, think of the funniest thing
that has ever happened.

00:46.771 --> 00:48.820
- Got it.
- Now double that.

00:49.535 --> 00:51.794
So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?

00:53.550 --> 00:57.227
Something even funnier than that
happens to Marshall today.

00:57.395 --> 00:59.619
First of all,
there's nothing funnier than that.

00:59.744 --> 01:01.316
Second of all, look,

01:01.726 --> 01:03.412
it's not that good a story.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.840
Come on, you guys.

01:04.965 --> 01:08.906
You're four young active people living
in the most exciting city on earth.

01:09.308 --> 01:10.850
You have no stories for me?

01:11.019 --> 01:13.473
What can I say?
Some weeks are just like that.

01:13.598 --> 01:15.802
It's the same thing over and over.

01:16.138 --> 01:17.871
A kid in my class ate some paste.

01:18.039 --> 01:21.845
I used deceitful means to hook up
with a less-than-intelligent girl.

01:22.475 --> 01:25.351
My ex-girlfriend Karen moved to town.
It's just, it's all the same.

01:26.312 --> 01:27.817
Karen's in town?

01:27.985 --> 01:29.613
You have got to be kidding me!

01:30.062 --> 01:32.079
<i>Kids, I think I've told you
about Karen.</i>

01:32.725 --> 01:35.912
<i>She was my girlfriend in high school,
and intermittently through college.</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:37.953
<i>She was beautiful, smart.</i>

01:38.344 --> 01:40.058
<i>I was madly in love with her.</i>

01:40.183 --> 01:42.903
<i>The only problem was,
Marshall and Lily were not.</i>

01:43.507 --> 01:46.588
<i>I think it had something to do
with every time Karen opened her mouth.</i>

01:46.713 --> 01:48.701
I love that you guys live in a dorm.

01:48.827 --> 01:50.274
It's so American.

01:50.574 --> 01:53.976
It's like, let's all eat
baloney sandwiches and be racist.

01:55.851 --> 01:57.986
Oh, my God, she was such a douche.

01:58.112 --> 02:00.621
Dude, she was the heiress
to the Massengill fortune.

02:02.168 --> 02:04.964
- She really wasn't that bad.
- Of course you think that.

02:05.089 --> 02:07.307
She turned you
into one of her douche zombies.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.985
I want to eat your brain,

02:10.110 --> 02:12.093
but only if it's organic

02:12.219 --> 02:13.827
and grass-fed.

02:14.946 --> 02:15.874
What?

02:16.526 --> 02:18.047
Will you pass the salt?

02:18.440 --> 02:19.444
Salt?

02:20.672 --> 02:21.725
So bourgeois.

02:22.896 --> 02:23.898
Totally.

02:27.366 --> 02:28.578
What's that thing?

02:29.373 --> 02:31.378
That's... a TV, Karen.

02:33.451 --> 02:34.804
I don't watch TV.

02:35.975 --> 02:37.016
Totally.

02:38.518 --> 02:41.680
You thought I actually bought
tickets to WrestleMania?

02:41.805 --> 02:43.258
I was being ironic.

02:44.343 --> 02:45.210
Totally.

02:46.089 --> 02:47.091
I know...

02:47.837 --> 02:49.682
that you were being ironic.

02:51.744 --> 02:52.746
I too...

02:53.370 --> 02:54.617
am being ironic.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.192
Let's do this!

02:59.395 --> 03:00.398
What?

03:00.966 --> 03:03.041
That makeup
didn't come off for a month.

03:03.166 --> 03:06.397
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.
I've never looked like a bigger jackass.

03:06.566 --> 03:08.519
Until today. Tell the story.

03:08.644 --> 03:09.823
Tell the story....

03:09.992 --> 03:11.369
Just let it go!

03:11.538 --> 03:13.492
Hold on.
Is it really funny?

03:14.617 --> 03:16.072
I am not kidding you.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.416
I almost don't want you to hear it,
because seriously,

03:19.542 --> 03:21.481
for the rest of your life,

03:21.924 --> 03:24.151
nothing else will ever be as funny

03:24.275 --> 03:28.252
and you will curse yourself for agreeing
to ever hear it in the first place.

03:29.382 --> 03:31.364
But seriously, you got to hear it.
It's so funny.

03:32.555 --> 03:33.393
Fine.

03:34.086 --> 03:37.313
<i>I was at the company gym
this morning playing basketball.</i>

03:37.438 --> 03:40.323
<i>The guys I work with can be
pretty brutal with their ridicule.</i>

03:41.482 --> 03:44.364
Look at Wisniewski.
He's gonna cry. Look at him.

03:44.489 --> 03:45.386
Look at him.

03:45.831 --> 03:48.398
I don't know, I don't think knees
aren't supposed to bend that way.

03:48.523 --> 03:50.317
I think he might have tore his ACL.

03:50.486 --> 03:53.867
Bro, the only thing that guy tore
was his cervix or maybe his hymen.

03:53.993 --> 03:55.805
Yeah, or his fallopian tube.

03:59.055 --> 04:02.144
I may have cleaned up
the dialogue a little bit, anyways...

04:02.700 --> 04:05.192
I go to my duffle bag
to get out my work clothes...

04:05.316 --> 04:08.328
Wait, wait...
I want to say it. I want to say it.

04:08.497 --> 04:09.964
Fine. You say it.

04:10.372 --> 04:14.221
Marshall goes to his duffle bag
to get out his work clothes, and...

04:14.528 --> 04:16.392
No, you say it.
It's funnier if you say it.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.921
No, let me say it.
No, you say it.

04:20.046 --> 04:21.406
You say it. Say it.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.350
Same time.

04:24.501 --> 04:25.852
No, you go, you go.

04:27.427 --> 04:29.837
- I forgot...
- Marshall forgot his pants!

04:39.005 --> 04:40.426
He forgot his pants.

04:42.345 --> 04:44.743
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

04:57.712 --> 05:00.280
Marshall forgot his pants.
That's pretty funny.

05:00.589 --> 05:03.101
It's no chimpanzee
wearing two tuxedos.

05:03.389 --> 05:06.961
I mean, what did he...?
He forgot he put the first one on?

05:08.528 --> 05:09.903
Stupid monkey.

05:11.932 --> 05:14.271
So Karen in New York.
Weird, right?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.904
Ted, you cannot get back
together with Karen.

05:17.072 --> 05:19.267
{\pos(192,210)}I never said I was going to get back
together with her.

05:19.392 --> 05:21.046
{\pos(192,220)}But I was thinking,
she's new in town.

05:21.172 --> 05:23.482
{\pos(192,220)}Would it be the worst thing
in the world if I gave her a call?

05:23.607 --> 05:25.118
{\pos(192,220)}It wouldn't be the worst thing{\in the world}.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.967
{\pos(192,210)} It would be the fourth worst thing.
1: Super volcano.

05:28.093 --> 05:29.861
{\pos(192,210)}2: An asteroid hits the Earth.

05:29.987 --> 05:32.064
{\pos(192,210)}3: All footage
of Evel Knievel is lost.

05:32.189 --> 05:34.239
{\pos(192,190)}4: Ted calls Karen.

05:34.364 --> 05:36.190
{\pos(192,190)}5: Lily gets eaten by a shark.

05:36.315 --> 05:38.886
{\pos(192,210)}I'm Lily and I approve
the order of that list.

05:40.057 --> 05:41.647
{\pos(192,210)}You don't know the whole story.

05:41.772 --> 05:44.254
{\pos(192,210)}Ted and Karen were off
and on all through college,

05:44.379 --> 05:45.990
{\pos(192,210)}and it always went the same way.

05:46.993 --> 05:49.208
{\pos(192,210)}They'd be having fun, douching it up,
and then one day...

05:50.236 --> 05:53.612
I know you think pepperoni is fascist
and you're totally right, so I...

05:54.248 --> 05:56.102
Oh, my God! Karen!

05:57.374 --> 05:58.484
Sorry, bro.

05:59.738 --> 06:01.131
{\pos(192,210)}Before you say anything,

06:01.256 --> 06:04.883
<i>{\pos(192,210)}I think that you should read
Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal.</i>

06:10.106 --> 06:13.518
{\pos(192,210)}So then they break up.
He would be all depressed, we would wait

06:13.644 --> 06:16.412
{\pos(192,210)}the appropriate amount of time then
we'd would tell him how we really felt.

06:17.318 --> 06:19.509
- Karen and I broke up.
- We hated her!

06:19.634 --> 06:21.174
Bitch had to go!

06:22.013 --> 06:24.231
And then Ted would build up
a head of steam

06:24.356 --> 06:28.347
and finally take the bus to Providence
to give Karen a piece of his mind.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.697
{\pos(192,210)}- How'd it go?
- Great.

06:32.722 --> 06:34.010
Look who's back.

06:38.374 --> 06:39.808
{\pos(192,210)}And then, sure enough,

06:39.934 --> 06:42.529
{\pos(192,210)}the whole thing
would start all over again.

06:43.355 --> 06:45.688
Make that 10,002 Maniacs,

06:45.813 --> 06:48.287
because I got us
Natalie Merchant tick...

06:50.031 --> 06:51.114
Sorry, bro.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.605
{\pos(192,190)}So she would come visit you at school
and the second you turned your back

06:55.731 --> 06:58.105
{\pos(192,210)}she would bring guys
back to your dorm room?

06:58.230 --> 06:59.343
{\pos(192,210)}Respect.

06:59.789 --> 07:02.498
I was an idiot.
She was my first real girlfriend.

07:02.623 --> 07:06.277
I was madly in love with her.
We all did stuff we regret in college.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.124
Junior year Marshall
grew a soul patch,

07:09.249 --> 07:12.284
wore a rasta hat, and asked everyone
to call him M.J. Smooth.

07:12.738 --> 07:14.800
I don't regret that for one second.

07:15.741 --> 07:18.177
So you guys absolutely
don't think I should call her?

07:18.345 --> 07:20.604
- Ted, no.
- Get it through your thick skull.

07:20.729 --> 07:21.931
Fine, I won't.

07:23.245 --> 07:25.641
Interesting piece of trivia:
I called her.

07:26.075 --> 07:28.247
- What are you doing?
- The pants story.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.960
I can't believe you called her.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.928
Why don't you just ask her
to lunch while you're at it?

07:33.097 --> 07:36.212
Because, Lily,
I'm not gonna ask her out to lunch...

07:36.897 --> 07:37.649
again.

07:39.071 --> 07:41.160
You asked her to lunch?

07:41.705 --> 07:44.963
Why would anyone want
to have lunch with their ex?

07:45.323 --> 07:46.380
Glad you asked,

07:46.506 --> 07:49.048
there are four possible motives
behind an "ex lunch."

07:49.174 --> 07:51.356
1: They want to get back together.

07:51.644 --> 07:54.030
Like my high school boyfriend
Scooter.

07:55.228 --> 07:56.803
Lilies, clever.

07:57.336 --> 07:59.589
I'm sorry I don't have
a scooter for you.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.294
My God, that's funny!

08:02.840 --> 08:04.269
I forgot how funny you are.

08:05.502 --> 08:07.654
- Where is that waiter?
- Why?

08:07.890 --> 08:10.203
You like waiters?
I can be a waiter.

08:11.162 --> 08:13.687
I'm going to be the greatest waiter
on this earth,

08:13.812 --> 08:15.177
and then you'll love me.

08:16.668 --> 08:18.774
2: They want to kill you.

08:19.234 --> 08:20.734
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.

08:21.314 --> 08:23.242
I'm glad we could finally do this.

08:23.607 --> 08:25.922
You know, after the ninth time
you rescheduled on me,

08:26.047 --> 08:27.462
I almost gave up on you.

08:27.630 --> 08:28.803
But you didn't.

08:28.928 --> 08:30.816
You just kept on trying.

08:31.562 --> 08:32.695
By the way,

08:33.413 --> 08:36.085
there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

08:39.331 --> 08:40.981
Gun! She's got a gun!

08:43.708 --> 08:44.908
It's a tie.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.912
3: They actually do
want to give you your stuff back.

08:49.037 --> 08:50.739
Like when I had lunch with Curt.

08:51.259 --> 08:53.539
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

08:59.817 --> 09:02.322
My snub-nosed.38 police special!

09:02.697 --> 09:04.700
I knew I left that somewhere.

09:05.363 --> 09:08.833
Every time I watch the news,
I'm like, "Hope that wasn't my gun".

09:10.534 --> 09:12.260
Breaking up was the right choice.

09:13.839 --> 09:17.692
Or 4: to rub your face
in how great they're doing.

09:17.967 --> 09:20.242
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.

09:20.508 --> 09:22.707
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?
- My ex.

09:25.329 --> 09:26.552
You look well, Marshall.

09:27.140 --> 09:28.642
You look okay, I guess.

09:30.147 --> 09:32.863
- I'm seeing someone.
- Already? Who?

09:33.193 --> 09:35.886
Lee Roberts.
He reads at a fifth grade level.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.264
You have to cancel the lunch.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.499
I would definitely do that,
definitely...

09:44.624 --> 09:45.816
Except I already had it.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.623
Robin, I'm going to need
to borrow the butt of your gun.

09:51.266 --> 09:53.979
I actually lost it again.
Can you believe that?

09:59.072 --> 10:01.571
How could break bread
with that woman?

10:01.739 --> 10:04.161
It was just lunch,
and you know she doesn't eat wheat.

10:05.195 --> 10:06.957
We had a great time catching up.

10:07.082 --> 10:10.054
We even laughed about what jerks
we were back then.

10:11.435 --> 10:13.983
I can't believe I had a beret
for each day of the week.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.102
I can't believe I had
an iron-on image

10:16.227 --> 10:18.031
of Molière on my backpack.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.758
- Man, we were pretentious.
- So pretentious.

10:23.972 --> 10:25.140
What can I get you?

10:28.501 --> 10:29.879
I don't want to cause a scene,

10:30.072 --> 10:32.650
but your wine list
has a Châteauneuf-du-Pape

10:32.775 --> 10:34.835
listed under the "Côtes de Provence".

10:35.003 --> 10:36.841
You might want to alert
your sommelier.

10:38.124 --> 10:39.391
And for you?

10:39.894 --> 10:41.295
I hate to go off-menu,

10:41.421 --> 10:44.653
but can you bring us some bruschett
with fresh mozzarell?

10:44.779 --> 10:45.533
<i>Grazie.</i>

10:47.999 --> 10:49.626
It was great. It was great.

10:49.752 --> 10:52.136
I mean, there was one weird
moment towards the end.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.450
How do you say good-bye
in those situations?

10:54.575 --> 10:57.894
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar.
A handshake is too formal.

10:58.019 --> 11:00.774
And a hug is just like
a public dry hump.

11:01.991 --> 11:03.753
I think you're hugging wrong.

11:04.845 --> 11:06.721
- So what happened?
- Well...

11:07.101 --> 11:08.977
Schopenhauer made
a saucy little argument

11:09.343 --> 11:10.897
in which he posited...

11:12.828 --> 11:15.955
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside and
bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.299
Karen was the first girl
I ever loved.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.008
And after the year I've had,

11:22.133 --> 11:24.333
I don't know,
I guess having lunch with her just...

11:24.458 --> 11:27.489
remind me of what it was like to be 18
and have my whole life figured out.

11:28.536 --> 11:30.273
And I would like to remind everyone

11:30.397 --> 11:33.215
that at least
I was wearing pants, Marshall.

11:35.054 --> 11:37.227
You can't just go changing
the subject like that.

11:37.395 --> 11:38.596
The pants story.

11:38.722 --> 11:41.364
Pants story bomaye!
Pants story bomaye!

11:41.533 --> 11:42.615
There's no story!

11:42.740 --> 11:45.793
I had a little situation,
so I called Lily.

11:45.963 --> 11:48.885
- Refresh us, what was that situation?
- I forgot my pants.

11:50.642 --> 11:52.395
What do you mean
you forgot your pants?

11:52.565 --> 11:55.738
I forgot them.
Now, I need you to bring me some.

11:56.146 --> 11:57.536
What about your spare pants?

11:58.023 --> 11:59.714
Last Thursday, the mustard incident.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.940
Jeez, woman, you have
the memory of a goldfish.

12:02.301 --> 12:04.712
Ted, you're not
getting off that easy.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.855
Marshall's pants story,
while amusing...

12:07.024 --> 12:09.424
Amusing?
Try very amusing.

12:10.115 --> 12:12.538
Is nothing compared
to this Karen madness.

12:12.663 --> 12:13.750
Finish your story.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.341
What? That's it.
It was just one kiss in the restaurant.

12:16.891 --> 12:18.995
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?

12:19.412 --> 12:21.021
Did you kiss somewhere else?

12:21.190 --> 12:23.159
Like where, in a tree?

12:23.477 --> 12:26.070
No, Lily, we did not
make out in a tree.

12:26.196 --> 12:27.332
What's with this one?

12:30.357 --> 12:31.660
What did you do?

12:38.439 --> 12:39.840
How could you?

12:40.997 --> 12:43.388
Marshall forgot to bring
his pants to work today,

12:43.513 --> 12:46.345
and you're still the stupidest
person at this table.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.585
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.

12:48.711 --> 12:50.767
We both know
your real motivation here.

12:50.891 --> 12:54.034
You hate Karen because she lingered.

12:54.203 --> 12:55.703
You son of a bitch.

12:56.288 --> 12:58.852
- What do you mean she lingered?
- February 5,

12:59.097 --> 13:02.016
1998. I was painting...

13:05.037 --> 13:05.944
Sorry.

13:06.626 --> 13:07.628
Sorry.

13:12.952 --> 13:15.598
You know, that color palette
is a bit derivative

13:15.723 --> 13:18.018
of early Van Gogh, don't you think?

13:21.659 --> 13:23.706
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,

13:23.831 --> 13:25.635
whatever, that's your business.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.392
But I catch you peeping
on my man's junk

13:29.517 --> 13:31.257
and you linger?

13:31.672 --> 13:34.026
You gots to get got.

13:34.194 --> 13:36.246
The game is the game.

13:37.159 --> 13:39.541
In Karen's defense,
I had just worked out.

13:40.521 --> 13:42.342
Why'd you have
to paint Marshall nude anyway?

13:42.608 --> 13:44.646
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.

13:45.061 --> 13:46.104
The point is,

13:46.273 --> 13:48.793
Karen is a dirty linger,

13:48.918 --> 13:51.410
and you cannot bring her back
into our lives.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.594
Relax, it was just that one night!

13:53.955 --> 13:56.091
And the next three after that.
And one morning.

13:56.468 --> 13:59.081
But at least
I had pants on, Marshall.

13:59.685 --> 14:02.945
- Although, actually, I didn't.
- Wait, this happened in our apartment?

14:03.782 --> 14:05.898
- Where was I?
- You know those sleeping pills

14:06.024 --> 14:08.225
you're taking to keep
on your crazy new schedule?

14:08.351 --> 14:10.090
I think they're stronger
than you realize.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.476
La Fontaine gets
the puck to Turgeon.

14:20.001 --> 14:21.253
Turgeon shoots.

14:22.131 --> 14:23.183
Glove save.

14:27.017 --> 14:29.097
Don't worry.
I won't tell Marshall.

14:30.776 --> 14:32.928
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want one?

14:37.242 --> 14:37.963
Beer.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.282
I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.

14:47.705 --> 14:50.276
Ted, sure it's fun
to look back at a time

14:50.402 --> 14:53.258
when you were a fresh-faced
farm girl with a virgin's glow.

14:54.429 --> 14:57.411
But all that stuff...
Ohio, Karen, college...

14:57.536 --> 14:59.100
all that was BS.

14:59.226 --> 15:00.571
"Before Stinson."

15:01.106 --> 15:02.923
Now your life is awesome!

15:03.049 --> 15:05.432
I mean, yeah, you still live
with your ex-girlfriend,

15:05.556 --> 15:07.198
which is ridiculous.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.096
Your laser tag chops
are almost nonexistent.

15:10.221 --> 15:11.311
And your wardrobe,

15:11.879 --> 15:13.401
it's like, what,

15:13.526 --> 15:15.575
are you allergic to quality fabrics?

15:15.701 --> 15:17.453
Seriously, Ted, shape up.

15:19.225 --> 15:20.504
What were we talking about?

15:21.761 --> 15:25.628
- So what's next with this broad?
- Please, the story's already written.

15:25.863 --> 15:28.635
Ted is Charlie Brown
trying to kick the football

15:28.760 --> 15:31.419
and Karen's Lucy, who pulls it
away at the last second

15:31.544 --> 15:32.707
and has sex with it.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.018
You guys know what I mean.
Ted's gonna fall in love,

15:37.143 --> 15:39.578
and then Karen's gonna cheat
on him with some meathead,

15:39.704 --> 15:40.709
who's like...

15:41.359 --> 15:42.818
"Sorry, bro."

15:44.250 --> 15:47.740
Wrong, wrong! You must have left
the right answer in your pants,

15:47.865 --> 15:50.092
because that's exactly
what didn't happen.

15:50.260 --> 15:53.477
<i>Because here's what happened.
One afternoon, we were at Karen's place.</i>

15:57.072 --> 15:58.125
Oh, my God.

15:58.784 --> 15:59.703
How could you?

16:03.653 --> 16:04.705
Sorry, bro.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.240
<i>So this time,
the meathead Karen was cheating with...</i>

16:12.408 --> 16:14.327
Was me, Ted.

16:14.860 --> 16:15.675
Me.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.744
Remember that time
Marshall forgot his pants?

16:18.869 --> 16:19.678
Damn it!

16:19.923 --> 16:22.980
You quit trying to change the subject.
You crossed the line.

16:23.314 --> 16:27.159
You are complicit in breaking
some poor guy's heart. And you,

16:28.414 --> 16:31.043
you of all people
know exactly how that feels.

16:31.882 --> 16:33.761
You really don't want to tell
the pants story?

16:33.930 --> 16:35.642
- What?
- Pants, pants...

16:37.525 --> 16:38.910
Fine! Okay?

16:39.036 --> 16:42.327
So, Lily came down to the office
to bring me my pants...

16:42.497 --> 16:44.752
- Why did she have to do that?
- Because I forgot my pants.

16:47.005 --> 16:50.435
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to give Marshall something.

16:51.690 --> 16:53.544
Here to give him something.

16:53.669 --> 16:55.259
Gotcha. Nice.

16:55.452 --> 16:58.040
Yeah, but I'm in a hurry.
Can I just give it to you?

17:00.677 --> 17:01.729
Sure, okay.

17:03.244 --> 17:05.181
And then you'll give it to him?

17:05.355 --> 17:07.651
Wait. I don't know about all that.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.953
I mean,
yours would have to be really good.

17:12.154 --> 17:14.421
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

17:14.780 --> 17:16.553
Marshall forgot his pants,

17:16.722 --> 17:18.518
so I'm bringing him a new pair.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.848
Marshall forgot his pants.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.772
It's a good thing that you came by

17:23.897 --> 17:26.858
because he has
a really important meeting today,

17:26.983 --> 17:30.781
and it would be pretty embarrassing
and not at all funny

17:31.222 --> 17:33.623
if he were to show up
not wearing pants.

17:35.063 --> 17:37.792
- I'll make sure he gets these.
- Great. Thanks, Barney.

17:39.163 --> 17:40.957
And you didn't give him his pants.

17:41.335 --> 17:43.058
Theodore Evelyn Mosby.

17:43.519 --> 17:45.336
Of course I gave him his pants.

17:45.461 --> 17:47.351
I gave Lily my word.
My word is oak.

17:48.781 --> 17:51.698
Though I did make some alterations.

17:58.056 --> 18:00.983
Now, as you'll see on page 44
of the contract...

18:01.686 --> 18:03.357
When did you join AC/DC?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.608
Now, can we please just turn
to page 44 of the contract.

18:11.506 --> 18:13.888
I think the Oliver Twist
auditions are down the hall!

18:18.705 --> 18:22.120
Please, sir, may I have
some more... pants?

18:30.570 --> 18:31.858
More pan...

18:38.491 --> 18:40.006
That's it?
That's the whole story?

18:40.779 --> 18:43.399
- So what happened with Karen?
- I'll finish it for you.

18:43.524 --> 18:45.092
Ted left without saying anything

18:45.217 --> 18:47.966
and Karen got exactly
what she wanted.

18:49.536 --> 18:50.495
Not this time.

18:50.915 --> 18:53.086
So you have a boyfriend?

18:53.255 --> 18:55.068
We've been drifting apart
for a long time.

18:55.194 --> 18:56.977
I've been meaning
to break up with him.

18:57.894 --> 18:59.311
You are unbelievable.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.567
You don't have the guts
to break up with someone

19:01.693 --> 19:04.452
like a decent human being,
so instead you pull this crap.

19:06.510 --> 19:07.963
Okay, you're right.

19:09.804 --> 19:11.239
I'm great with books.

19:11.712 --> 19:13.165
I'm great with art.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.943
I'm great with
identifying French wines

19:16.068 --> 19:18.744
from within a mile of where the grapes
are grown. But...

19:20.084 --> 19:22.296
I'm really bad when it comes
to looking someone in the eye

19:22.422 --> 19:24.385
and telling them the truth
about how I feel.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.201
We're both bad at that. But...

19:28.769 --> 19:32.130
I think we both need to change.
So, why don't I go first?

19:33.916 --> 19:35.965
You're a really hurtful
and reckless person,

19:36.091 --> 19:38.636
and I never want to see you
or speak to you again.

19:40.601 --> 19:41.803
<i>Au revoir.</i>

19:42.686 --> 19:43.732
Ted, wait.

19:47.805 --> 19:51.297
Actually,"au revoir"means
"until we see each other again".

19:52.846 --> 19:54.851
So, I'm assuming that you mean

19:55.320 --> 19:57.776
we will in fact
see each other again?

20:01.209 --> 20:02.261
Sorry, bro.

20:05.593 --> 20:07.219
Thank you. Thank you.

20:07.387 --> 20:09.180
- Bravo.
- I am impressed with you.

20:09.305 --> 20:11.482
You, too, Marshall.
Have you been wearing those all day?

20:12.039 --> 20:13.362
They show off my calves.

20:14.575 --> 20:16.414
Pants story. Tell it again.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.842
You know, maybe it was good
you called Karen.

20:21.016 --> 20:23.684
It definitely was.
And not just for me, but for her, too.

20:24.024 --> 20:25.995
Later that night,
she sat down with Jerry,

20:26.120 --> 20:28.699
and she had the break-up talk
she always avoided with me.

20:29.170 --> 20:30.362
<i>So you see, kids,</i>

20:30.488 --> 20:32.753
<i>sometimes when you have to have
a tough conversation,</i>

20:33.231 --> 20:34.420
<i>the best thing to do...</i>

20:34.545 --> 20:37.265
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

20:38.186 --> 20:40.734
You said you were never gonna talk
to Karen again, right?

20:42.151 --> 20:44.328
Then how do you know
she took your advice?

20:46.950 --> 20:47.952
Right.

20:48.249 --> 20:49.323
About that...

20:49.448 --> 20:51.757
After she broke up with that dude,
she called me, we went out,

20:51.883 --> 20:54.575
we hooked up, we've been dating ever
since. We're really seeing eye to eye,

20:54.700 --> 20:57.584
It just feels different somehow.
Here she comes now. Be cool!
