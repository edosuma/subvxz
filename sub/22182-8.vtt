WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.038
You're the first Special Ops
chick I ever met.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.407
How do you control yourself
around so many hot, sweaty men?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.076
Only hard part's the smell, sir.
(laughs)

00:08.709 --> 00:10.311
RICHARD:
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:10.344 --> 00:11.645
They have the package.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.483
GALLO: The prisoner who got away
is Davis Goundry.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.385
We stumbled onto something here.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.652
We lied in our debriefs.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.321
Davis Goundry's still alive.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.057
What if we made a mistake
that night in Somalia?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.792
What if we let
a terrorist go free?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.060
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured,

00:26.094 --> 00:27.328
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.730
(shouting, grunts)

00:29.763 --> 00:31.532
(yells)
You still with me?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.301
Not for much longer.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.607
Anchor Zero-Six, we have
the body of Sergeant Hendrix.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.242
Grief will hit you.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.576
And when it does, reach out.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.512
To Sergeant Hendrix.
You didn't know him, man.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.247
I know that he was
a great soldier.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.748
And what would you

00:47.781 --> 00:49.750
know about that?
Hey!

00:49.783 --> 00:51.752
You are grounded from flying,
effective now.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.687
PORTER: We're going after
Khalid's right-hand man.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.623
What's his name?
Davis Goundry.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.197
(birds chirping)

01:12.640 --> 01:15.143
Excuse me, mister?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.610
Morning.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.279
You okay?
You're pretty far out here.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.182
Yeah.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.117
Westfield, right?

01:23.151 --> 01:24.318
You, uh, you from
Westfield, Vermont?

01:24.352 --> 01:25.486
Montgomery.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.687
How'd you know?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.689
Montgomery. See, I was close.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.824
I, uh, I got a knack
for, uh, placing accents.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.861
Yeah. Would you mind waiting
a sec while I run your I.D.?

01:33.894 --> 01:35.829
Yeah. Oh, you know, uh...

01:35.863 --> 01:38.399
Sorry, I don't, I don't
have it on me.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.500
Where you coming from, sir?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.135
Lindsey Beach.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.636
I'm renting a cabin
right on the water.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.173
(door alarm chiming)

01:46.740 --> 01:49.177
All right, we're 40 miles away
from Lindsey.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.878
Only thing we're not far away
from is the border.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.215
I'm gonna need to bring you in
for some questions, sir.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.650
You're not gonna be
bringing me anywhere.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.219
And I'm gonna hurt you
if you try.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.554
Get your hands in the air.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.423
(radio crackles)
You call for backup,
they're here in 20 minutes.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.625
You don't have 20 minutes.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.894
You got 20 seconds
to drop that gun.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.662
Now, you're just
a nice kid

02:08.696 --> 02:10.264
from Montgomery, Vermont.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.699
You're no match for me.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.335
Time's up.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.670
*

02:22.776 --> 02:24.512
MAN:
Left, right.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.746
MEN:
Left to the right!

02:25.779 --> 02:27.781
MAN: Left, right.
MEN: Hold!

02:27.815 --> 02:29.750
Didn't think you'd show
your face this morning.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.686
Yeah, I may be grounded, but
I'm still allowed in briefings.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.754
Hey, I missed a call

02:33.787 --> 02:34.955
from you last night.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.757
Surprised to see it.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.626
What, you mean, after you went
aggro and shoved Ian? Yeah.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.960
You owe him an apology.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.795
Is that why you called?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.331
No.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.500
I called because
Davis Goundry is alive.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.635
Watch where you're going, Cho.
Whatever.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.936
You've had a problem with me

02:48.969 --> 02:50.671
from day one and
I'm sick of it.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.905
Oh, really?
We got an issue here?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.275
Yeah. He's the one
that shoved me.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.610
COOGAN: (scoffs) Come on,
what are we, in third grade?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.546
Get over it, both of you.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.381
Care to say
something, Captain?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.783
He covered it.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
What is his deal?

03:04.552 --> 03:05.586
I don't know.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.720
Mother didn't hug him enough?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.822
And he can't handle
a woman in uniform.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.658
You know, you can
go to the colonel.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.360
Yeah. That'd just
make it worse.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.761
We've both dealt with guys
like Smitty before.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.396
Best thing to do
is ride it out.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.764
Yeah.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.832
This is Davis Goundry.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.769
Ex-Army, recruited
as a CIA field specialist.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.904
He is now an enemy of the state.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.674
HASKINS: He crossed the
U.S.-Canada border this morning,

03:26.707 --> 03:28.742
assaulted a border agent,
then evaded local police

03:28.776 --> 03:31.679
and two CBP units
before disappearing.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.647
He's dangerous.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.616
And right now, he's our only
lead to finding Jimmy Kam.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.884
You will all be
singing new NDAs.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.653
We are reading you into
a new program today.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.656
What you're about to hear
is highly restricted.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.392
The reason Goundry would know

03:44.425 --> 03:46.394
where Khalid
is holding Sergeant Kam

03:46.427 --> 03:49.897
is because the warlord was, once
upon a time, Goundry's asset.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.300
He managed Khalid
in a covert program

03:52.333 --> 03:54.702
to buy uranium
off of the African black market,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.604
in order to keep it
out of terrorist hands.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.038
Well...
COOGAN:
Sir, are you telling us

03:58.071 --> 03:59.640
that the man
that's holding Jimmy right now

03:59.673 --> 04:00.841
used to work for the CIA?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.743
Well, black market
uranium dealers

04:02.776 --> 04:05.346
don't knowingly
like to sell to Americans.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.381
We needed a middleman.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.016
The plan was: Khalid buys it,

04:09.049 --> 04:11.419
Goundry destroys it,
everybody wins.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.756
Only, Davis Goundry did not turn
the uranium over for disposal.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.690
He hid it from us.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.959
We can only guess
what his intentions are.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.729
Whether money or ideology was
the reason that Goundry turned,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.731
we don't know,
but we need to find him.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.435
Officer Thea is in D.C.,
working his former contacts.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.437
And Lieutenant Porter

04:29.470 --> 04:31.905
is gonna step in
and head up the intel team here.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.343
Since this is
a domestic operation,

04:35.376 --> 04:37.511
FBI is running point.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.513
This is ADIC Perez.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.614
While they're
searching for Goundry,

04:40.648 --> 04:41.582
we are in a holding pattern.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.417
But you'll be in the air
the second they get

04:43.451 --> 04:45.453
Jimmy's location.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.087
So, for those of you
who aren't grounded

04:47.120 --> 04:49.757
for disciplinary reasons...

04:49.790 --> 04:52.426
be ready to go.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.362
So, Magnus has you running
the intel team.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.029
That's big.
Yeah.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.999
Though the FBI
started without us.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.835
They already spoke
to Goundry's living family.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.437
He's got a sister
and a nephew.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.473
Did they get anything useful?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.107
No. They think
he died three years ago.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.476
The CIA faked his death

05:08.509 --> 05:10.778
for a cover.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.981
Look, there's something I want
to talk to you about later

05:14.014 --> 05:16.817
when... we have a moment.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.752
Okay.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.359
HASKINS:
Dereliction of duty,

05:25.393 --> 05:27.961
shoving an officer-- I don't
know what's gotten into you.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.631
I made a mistake
last night, sir.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.799
I recognize that.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.501
You're supposed
to be a leader, Captain.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.802
That's not
how you've been acting.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.870
What do I have to do
to set this right?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.672
I just want to get back
in the cockpit.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.041
I'm assigning you to staff duty
in the maintenance department.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.877
They own you
until your head's straight.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.846
Sir, I don't need
to tighten fuselage screws

05:45.879 --> 05:46.880
to straighten my head.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.048
That's where you're wrong.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.817
You need to go
back to basics.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.118
Remember a little something
about respect

05:51.151 --> 05:52.720
and commitment to duty.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.587
(sighs softly)

05:53.621 --> 05:54.922
Am I clear, Captain?

05:54.955 --> 05:57.425
Yes, sir.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.893
Come on.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.830
You, uh, looking for your
dignity under that seat?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.433
Trying to get my head around
what we heard in that briefing.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.834
Yeah, guess now
we know for sure

06:06.867 --> 06:08.436
we did the wrong thing
that night.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.003
We saved a traitor's life.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.641
You know,
soon as Goundry gets caught,

06:13.674 --> 06:16.009
soon as they get him to talk,
it's all gonna come out.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.845
Yeah, but if catching Goundry

06:17.878 --> 06:19.513
helps us get closer
to finding Jimmy,

06:19.547 --> 06:20.814
then that's all that matters.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.883
Even if we get
court-martialed.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.518
Look, there's something
I should tell you.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.887
I saw another domino.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.121
When?

06:28.155 --> 06:29.923
Thea had it.
Are you sure?

06:29.957 --> 06:31.859
Unless she's keeping it

06:31.892 --> 06:33.627
in her desk drawer
for someone else.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.465
She closed it
soon as I walked in,

06:37.498 --> 06:38.866
but I saw it.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.100
Just like Khalid
and Goundry's,

06:40.133 --> 06:41.969
only double fours.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.804
So, maybe they're a token?

06:44.905 --> 06:45.973
A way for CIA assets

06:46.006 --> 06:47.475
to recognize each other
in the field.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.842
Meaning she was part
of the uranium operation.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.447
So, what do we do now?

06:53.481 --> 06:57.718
Uh... I'm gonna go see
Goundry's sister,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.553
see if she can shed some light
on where he is.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.054
Isn't that the FBI's job?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.156
Yeah, but I feel like
after talking to her before,

07:03.190 --> 07:04.592
she started to trust me.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.896
More than the FBI, at least.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.897
Well, good luck with that.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.533
Okay, what is your deal lately?

07:12.566 --> 07:15.068
Are you gonna jump
down my throat now, too?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.570
I got enough of that
from Haskins.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.905
Yeah, well, you deserved it.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.973
You got your ass grounded
for no good reason.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.709
I apologized to Ian.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.477
We're good.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.747
He forgives more easily
than I do.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.185
There she is.
Mrs. Kam? Mrs. Kam?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.987
Please, I really
need to get home.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.656
Ma'am, is it true
your husband's a Muslim?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.626
Jimmy was raised Muslim,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.594
but what does that have to do
with anything?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.129
Does he have any connection
to radical causes?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.731
Could he have been recruited?
That's insane.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.499
I really need to get home.
Just a few more questions.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.534
Get out of my way now!

07:48.969 --> 07:51.238
Ma'am. Mrs. Kam.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.473
*

08:07.054 --> 08:09.890
* We rolled on the street
without friends *

08:09.923 --> 08:12.092
* Trying to be someone...

08:12.125 --> 08:14.227
Sorry, we just closed
for the day.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.930
What are you doing here?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.599
I was just hoping to talk to you
for a few minutes.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.668
I'm tired of talking.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.070
I already spoke to the FBI.
That's why I'm here.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.138
Look, I understand why
you wouldn't want to trust them,

08:25.172 --> 08:26.974
but if there's
any information you have,

08:27.007 --> 08:29.877
anything you haven't told them,
you need to tell me.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.011
You should leave, Ms. Madani.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.180
Deidre, you had questions

08:33.213 --> 08:35.716
about your brother's loyalties
last time we spoke.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.585
But I can't help you
find the answers

08:37.618 --> 08:39.286
unless you tell me
everything you know.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.057
Before it's too late for him.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.162
You know, don't you?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
That he's alive.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.801
* Can't touch me when
the teeth begin to show... *

08:56.303 --> 08:58.305
*

09:03.010 --> 09:04.945
Your brother has information
that could help save

09:04.978 --> 09:07.615
a really good
friend of mine.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.983
I can bring him in
safely. Please.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.289
A few days ago,
I found a phone in a booth

09:16.323 --> 09:17.991
with my name taped on it.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.060
It rang.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.262
When I answered,
it was his voice.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.031
I couldn't believe it.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.833
What did he say?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.367
He wants me
to meet him tomorrow,

09:27.400 --> 09:29.369
and I don't know what to do.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.172
It's only gonna make things
worse if he keeps running.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.708
I know.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.645
Just...

09:37.678 --> 09:39.847
tell me where he wanted you
to meet him.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.920
Hey. Got your message.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.822
What's going on?
Hey.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.390
Goundry's been in touch
with his sister.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.893
What? Wait,
how do you know this?
Yeah.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.662
I didn't believe that
he wouldn't contact her.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.229
She's his only sibling.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.331
So I went to her diner.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.901
I-I just thought that
maybe she'd open up

10:00.934 --> 10:03.336
to someone who'd served,
someone like her brother.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.138
Okay, she gave
me the location

10:05.172 --> 10:07.240
of where they're
meeting tomorrow night.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.342
This is huge.
(chuckles softly)

10:09.376 --> 10:11.244
Though you could've
told me about this.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
You didn't have
to do this alone.
I know, I know.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.383
I just... I thought maybe,
you know, she'd open up to me.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.051
I don't know,
I kind of relate.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.187
I know what it's like to have
family disappear on you.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.255
Your dad.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.024
Yeah, well...

10:24.057 --> 10:26.026
So...

10:26.059 --> 10:28.161
listen, that thing that I want
to discuss with you--

10:28.195 --> 10:30.397
it-it's something
I want to ask, really.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.101
(chuckles softly)

10:34.134 --> 10:36.269
What would you think
about moving in with me?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.172
'Cause I got to say,
I've thought about it a lot,

10:39.206 --> 10:42.109
and while you were
in rehab in Germany,

10:42.142 --> 10:43.877
I went crazy
not being able to see you,

10:43.911 --> 10:45.412
not being able
to be with you.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.248
I was gonna ask you
when you got back, but...

10:48.281 --> 10:50.217
You were?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.052
You know, we found out
about Jimmy and...

10:52.085 --> 10:54.287
(quietly):
Yeah.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.455
I know.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.391
It's been a challenge
for both of us,

10:58.425 --> 11:01.795
but there's always gonna be
some kind of challenge, and...

11:01.829 --> 11:04.998
I want to live
through that with you.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.800
Babe, I don't know what to say.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.068
I didn't expect this. I...

11:08.101 --> 11:10.003
You don't have
to decide this minute.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.840
Just think about it.
(chuckles): Okay?

11:12.873 --> 11:15.709
Okay, I will.
Right now,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.211
we got to bring Goundry in,
find out what he knows.

11:23.216 --> 11:27.320
Breaking news now on the Army's
so-called P.O.W.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.991
We've learned that Jimmy Kam
may have ties to radical Islam.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.993
So was he really captured
or did he desert...

11:33.026 --> 11:34.061
It's unbelievable.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.262
Yeah, talk about fake news.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.329
I can't watch this crap.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.899
Hey. Does happen.

11:38.932 --> 11:39.867
What are you talking about?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.501
This Goundry guy turned.
Maybe Kam did, too.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.771
You're out of line, Smitty.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.906
I'll catch you later, Cho.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.240
Got some fuel lines to check.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.778
Notice he's a lot more
ornery now

11:50.811 --> 11:52.245
that Madani and him
aren't joined at the hip?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.414
(scoffs)

11:54.447 --> 11:56.016
How about you grab me
a soda, huh?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.951
I don't work for you, Smitty.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.052
You're such a tight-ass.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.253
You know,
it's this kind of banter

12:00.287 --> 12:01.488
that makes you so pleasant
to be around.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.324
I feel sorry
for your girlfriend.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.392
Feel sorry for yours.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.327
Great comeback.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.229
Need to learn your place, Cho.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.264
Screw you.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.141
You need to learn
your place, Cho.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.776
What are you doing?!

12:22.810 --> 12:23.944
Get off me!

12:23.977 --> 12:25.445
Get off me!

12:28.348 --> 12:29.316
Help!

12:29.349 --> 12:30.483
Shh.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.518
Help me!

12:31.551 --> 12:32.953
(muffled screaming)

12:32.986 --> 12:35.322
Shh.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.424
(muffled screaming)

12:43.396 --> 12:45.398
(panting)

13:01.214 --> 13:03.450
Sergeant Cho.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.219
Hey, you-you okay?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.555
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.091
Smitty say something?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.926
I know you all had words
earlier.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.527
I'm squared away, sir.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.462
You sure about that?

13:15.495 --> 13:16.830
Yes, sir.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.298
I have to go.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.480
This is great work, Chief
Madani, Lieutenant Porter.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.216
Credit where credit's due.
It was really all her, sir.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.218
PEREZ: So, you're the one who
talked to a material witness

13:38.251 --> 13:39.987
in a federal investigation?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.990
I just had to follow my hunch.
And your hunch paid off.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.158
You think the sister
will play ball with us?

13:45.192 --> 13:48.295
I do, sir. I did promise her
that we'd bring him in safely.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.197
We will. Let's get
to work on this.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.332
We got a lot of work to do
before tomorrow evening.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.901
(Magnus claps hands)

13:55.468 --> 13:57.871
Great job.
You're dismissed.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.120
Dauud?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.221
(inhales sharply)

14:17.958 --> 14:19.159
Where am I?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.894
It is good
to see you again.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.296
I am sorry for the death
of your friend.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.067
What is this place?

14:27.100 --> 14:30.470
It's not far from where
you've been, just better.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.272
There is a bathroom

14:32.305 --> 14:34.241
with shower and
fresh change of clothes.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.108
I-I don't understand.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.178
One of your guys
put a gun to my head,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.280
told me Khalid had
big plans for me.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.249
Khalid wanted his brother.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.385
Ever since he did not get him,
something in him has broken.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.989
All he wants now is revenge
on your country.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.391
He thinks that
you can help him get it.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.196
I'm not helping him do anything.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.430
You tell him that.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.032
You tell him

14:59.066 --> 15:01.634
that Sergeant Hendrix's blood
is on his hands!

15:01.668 --> 15:04.337
You should accept
Khalid's favor with respect.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.407
If you do not,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.209
you will end up
like your friend.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.582
(door opens, closes)

15:25.392 --> 15:28.095
TV REPORTER: The public is
clamoring to learn the details

15:28.128 --> 15:30.397
of Sergeant Kam's Muslim beliefs

15:30.430 --> 15:32.199
following the death
of Kam's comrade,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.434
Sergeant Shane Hendrix.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.369
Jimmy was captured fighting
to protect the people

15:36.403 --> 15:38.205
who are saying
these things.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.507
Look, they'll say anything
for ratings, Jess.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
You just have to ignore it.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.443
Have any of them served?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.412
Have any of them
given one-tenth

15:45.445 --> 15:46.279
of what Jimmy has?

15:46.313 --> 15:47.981
What can I do to help?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.549
Just help me
get my mind off of it.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.618
Talk about something else,
anything else.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.353
Your life, for a change.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.554
Ian asked me to move in.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.090
Well, that's huge.
What'd you say?

15:57.124 --> 15:58.758
I don't know if I'm ready yet.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
You know, if you don't say yes,

16:00.493 --> 16:02.129
that's gonna send
a pretty hard message.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.530
Well, it changes things,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.565
sharing your life like that,
your space.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.202
I know you and Jimmy
moved pretty fast.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.371
But was there never a time
where there were things

16:11.404 --> 16:14.541
that you just couldn't tell him?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.477
You mean things like,
"Jimmy, I'm scared

16:17.510 --> 16:19.412
"that I'm getting closer
to Max's friend's dad

16:19.446 --> 16:21.548
"than I am to you,
and I don't want to lose you,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.216
"but I also can't talk to you.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.518
Oh, and, oops,
I slept with him."

16:25.552 --> 16:29.156
Do you ever wish
you hadn't told Jimmy?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.390
I wish it hadn't happened.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.492
But I'm glad I told him.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.095
Is there something you feel
like you don't want to tell Ian?

16:35.128 --> 16:38.231
There are things I feel like
I can't tell Ian,

16:38.265 --> 16:39.466
yet.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.202
Then the question is:
do you believe Ian

16:42.235 --> 16:44.204
would stand by you
when he does find out?

16:44.237 --> 16:46.339
If the answer is yes,

16:46.373 --> 16:49.276
you should take
the leap and move in.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.378
It's what I think.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.349
GALLO:
Madani.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.385
Hey. Heard you and Ian
got a lead on Goundry.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.121
Yeah. An FBI team is headed
to apprehend him tonight.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.555
Ian's with them.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.525
So a couple hours from now,
our secret will be out.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.129
Maybe.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.531
Yeah.
(chuckles)

17:11.564 --> 17:14.134
I don't know why I'm bothering
with this grunt work.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.602
I mean, what's the point
if we might be

17:15.635 --> 17:16.603
in lockup this time tomorrow?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.139
What's the point
of any of it?

17:19.172 --> 17:21.308
What?

17:21.341 --> 17:24.611
Lately, you've just been in
some kind of self-pity tailspin.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.446
I don't get it.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.148
I'm not asking you
to "get it."

17:28.181 --> 17:30.483
Seems like you've
just given up.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.790
*

17:44.731 --> 17:47.066
Command, you've got light
on your southwest corner.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.703
That did it.
You're blacked out.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.306
The sedan outside is
the same make and model

17:53.340 --> 17:54.641
Goundry's sister drives.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.476
Even matched a ding
on the fender.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.844
You found a good lookalike
for her, too.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.546
Outstanding work.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.614
The place kind of looks like
a horror film.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.550
MAGNUS:
You scared, Porter?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.785
Yeah, I once squatted
in an abandoned railyard

18:05.818 --> 18:07.420
with a girl from Topeka.
(chuckles)

18:07.454 --> 18:10.757
We hopped freight trains
after undergrad.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.860
Oh, we had a time.

18:13.893 --> 18:14.794
Activity,

18:14.827 --> 18:16.496
east entrance.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.440
Male driver.
I think it's Goundry.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.612
(sirens whooping)

18:35.348 --> 18:37.617
AGENT: Car two's in position.
We've got him blocked in.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.652
Cover me.
AGENT 2: Blake to left side.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.154
Watch him now, watch him.
Go, go, go, go.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.722
Stay where you are!
Hands spread!

18:42.755 --> 18:45.925
On the pavement!

18:45.958 --> 18:48.461
Stand down! Stand down.
It's not Goundry.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.596
Please, please.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.332
I didn't do anything wrong,
I swear.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.501
Some dude gave me
a hundred bucks to drive here.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.735
Said you guys would
think it was funny.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.338
He didn't say
you'd be cops.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.308
Goundry's
jerking us around.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.226
Davis?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.593
Yeah.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.761
(gasps)

19:21.794 --> 19:23.430
Give me your phone.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.565
What happened to you?
Give me your phone now.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.636
I need answers.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.871
Davis, I lied for you,

19:31.904 --> 19:34.774
let you send the FBI
on a wild goose chase,

19:34.807 --> 19:37.510
put myself and my
son at risk. Why?

19:37.544 --> 19:38.945
Because they want me dead.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.847
Okay? Now,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.449
did they ask you
about the uranium?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.584
No. Davis.
Good.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.420
Why do they want you dead?
What have you done?

19:47.454 --> 19:48.521
I've done nothing.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.290
It's all lies.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.658
I have a job to do here,

19:51.691 --> 19:53.426
but I need proof.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.861
And I need to find
Snake Eyes.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.296
Snake Eyes?
Yes.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.697
What are you talking about?

19:57.730 --> 20:01.301
I need time and you bought me
some time, but, D,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.536
they're gonna be coming after
you now, too, all right?

20:03.570 --> 20:05.738
So you have to disappear.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.608
(exhales)
I-I have to disappear?

20:08.641 --> 20:10.310
Yes.
What does that even mean?

20:10.343 --> 20:14.414
Here. There's a month's
worth of cash, okay?

20:14.447 --> 20:17.350
Now, I set up
a safe house for you.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.451
They'll never find you.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.819
I can't do this, Davis.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.590
I gave them everything that
I had, and they betrayed me.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.527
I'm trying, trying to do
the right thing here.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.464
You just...
you have to trust me.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.600
Okay?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.635
Just trust me.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.709
Deidre Goundry and her
son have disappeared.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.711
The diner's closed up.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.614
They left in a
hurry, no trace.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.349
Ian, this is all my fault.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.351
I had no business going to her.
Are you kidding?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.752
(scoffs)

20:52.785 --> 20:56.656
Haskins, Magnus,
even the FBI, recognize

20:56.689 --> 20:58.458
how close you got us.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.693
That's why they want you to keep
working on this with me.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.296
What?

21:03.330 --> 21:04.997
I'm a pilot.
How am I gonna...?

21:05.031 --> 21:07.066
There's no missions
being flown right now.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.768
There's no reason why
you can't be here.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.706
All right.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.676
I'm in.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.445
Okay.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.780
(sighs)

21:20.813 --> 21:22.582
A field specialist
like him is trained

21:22.615 --> 21:24.484
to hide when the
heat is on him.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.885
He'll go someplace
hard to find,

21:25.918 --> 21:28.788
hard to access,
someplace he knows well.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.857
That's not a lot to go on.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.560
We got to keep digging,
go through Goundry's life,

21:33.593 --> 21:34.961
all the way back to
when he was a kid.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.731
Even the smallest details
can mean something.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.767
Sounds like
we're gonna be here all day.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.804
Do you know that if
we lived together,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.039
we could take our
work home with us.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.409
We couldn't possibly

21:49.442 --> 21:51.978
take classified documents
outside of here.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.481
You know what I mean.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.986
How you doing, Sergeant?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.921
I'm fine.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.023
You sure about that?

22:04.056 --> 22:07.394
Sure as I was before.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.730
I've been accused
of giving up on things lately.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.865
I can't shake this feeling

22:12.899 --> 22:16.503
something was up
with you the other night.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.571
You need help,
you can talk to me.

22:18.605 --> 22:19.672
Not trying to be pushy.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.441
Yeah, but you are.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.411
There's no point in
talking about it, okay?

22:24.444 --> 22:26.713
About what?

22:26.746 --> 22:29.115
Whatever it is,
it stays between us.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.688
Sergeant Smith assaulted me.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.724
He forced
himself on me.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.126
He tried...

22:43.763 --> 22:45.832
I fought him off.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.802
There, now you know.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.604
Zoe, I'm the Unit
Victim Advocate.

22:51.638 --> 22:52.705
I can help you.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.607
I know you're
the U.V.A.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.042
I wouldn't have said
anything otherwise.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.077
But I don't need
your help, okay?

22:58.110 --> 23:01.714
You want to talk to the SARC
specialist first, I get that.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.115
She can help you decide
if you want

23:03.149 --> 23:04.717
to go restricted
or unrestricted.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.853
But an official investigation
is the only way

23:06.886 --> 23:09.021
to make sure
Sergeant Smith is punished.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.523
He won't get punished.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.625
Probably just get
a slap on the wrist.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.826
Not if you go unrestricted.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.127
Bring it to trial.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.664
A trial can get
really public.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.933
You know what it
took to get here?

23:20.967 --> 23:24.537
One of the only
women in this unit.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.774
And being out-- that
makes it that much harder.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.577
If I report this unrestricted,
that'll bring a bunch

23:30.610 --> 23:32.679
of attention to me, and
that is not what I need.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.146
Sergeant, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do, but...

23:34.180 --> 23:36.916
Yeah, but you guys
can't help yourself.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.887
I know the system
fails sometimes.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.989
A lot of times, maybe.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.157
But Haskins
is different.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.893
How many units
you been a part of?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.160
What are you driving at?

23:48.194 --> 23:50.763
I've been
in four different units,

23:50.797 --> 23:54.033
and I've never had
a colonel like Haskins.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.902
He's not gonna let
the system fail you.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.973
(knock on door)

24:01.007 --> 24:04.043
If you're a reporter,
I'm not talking.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.478
I'm not a reporter, Mrs. Kam.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.846
I'm a communications consultant

24:06.879 --> 24:07.980
for your congresswoman,
Simone Porter.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.650
What do you want?

24:10.683 --> 24:12.685
The congresswoman doesn't want
the press tarnishing a hero

24:12.719 --> 24:13.986
from her district.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.955
She asked me to offer
my firm's support

24:15.988 --> 24:17.890
in defending your
husband's reputation.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.926
Pro bono, of course.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.770
The things they are saying
about my husband are lies.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.507
And I am terrified that our son
is going to hear them.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.875
We'll stop all of that.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.276
You'll make a statement

24:37.309 --> 24:39.245
about how your husband
didn't actively worship,

24:39.278 --> 24:41.514
deemphasizing the role of Islam
in his life.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.885
Sorry. I was told...

24:45.918 --> 24:47.520
Is that not true?

24:47.554 --> 24:49.989
It is, but...

24:50.022 --> 24:52.258
Why does it matter
if Jimmy is Muslim?

24:52.291 --> 24:54.961
He's a hero.
Can't we just say that?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.664
In order to beat these people,
you have to play their game.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.898
And their rules
aren't always fair.

25:02.301 --> 25:05.538
* Hold on to your heart

25:05.572 --> 25:09.709
* This might hurt a little

25:09.742 --> 25:12.211
* This might
hurt a little *

25:12.244 --> 25:16.783
* Allow me one false start

25:16.816 --> 25:20.653
* My legs are surely
more brittle *

25:20.687 --> 25:23.890
* My legs are
surely more brittle *

25:23.923 --> 25:28.595
* I'll hold on
to your heart... *

25:30.763 --> 25:31.964
Sit.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.735
Have tea with me, brother.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.004
You're not my brother.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.606
I want to tell you a story.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.641
I used to work for your CIA.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.076
I don't believe you.
It's true.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.613
And I grew close
with the man they sent here.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.115
I liked him, very much.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.251
He is the only American
I have ever... liked.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.986
You see,

25:54.020 --> 25:56.956
all I did was for my brother.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.792
The CIA said
they would give him to me

25:59.826 --> 26:02.929
in return for my work,
but... they lied.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.064
Instead, they sent
a helicopter

26:05.097 --> 26:07.600
in the dead of night
to take their man away,

26:07.634 --> 26:09.702
so I had it shot down,

26:09.736 --> 26:13.139
which is, of course,
how we... met.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.308
I thought then they would have
to give my brother.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.846
I was willing to trade you
for him, but... again,

26:19.879 --> 26:21.047
they lied.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.348
I know now

26:22.381 --> 26:23.950
I will never get him back.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.384
Why are you telling me this?

26:25.417 --> 26:29.188
Because you need to know
what your people are like.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.090
They will abandon you, too.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.025
You're wrong.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.796
Are you sure?

26:40.266 --> 26:42.234
Read it.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.808
You will come
to see things my way.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.409
And when you do,

26:50.442 --> 26:53.045
we will make a video.

26:53.079 --> 26:57.917
You will stand beside me and
send a message to your country.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.119
You will tell them this

27:00.152 --> 27:02.722
is now a battle between us.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.925
A battle they will lose.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.438
Sir, if I may?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.708
By all means.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.375
What's going on?

27:23.409 --> 27:27.747
Captain Gallo encouraged me
to come to you with this.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.318
Sergeant Smith assaulted me.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.420
He tried to rape me.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.423
(sighs)

27:37.456 --> 27:39.258
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.295
You are aware
that coming to me makes this

27:43.329 --> 27:45.698
an unrestricted report?
Yes, sir.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.399
But if I didn't come forward,
it'd mean

27:47.433 --> 27:50.136
he could just do this
to another woman down the line.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.071
I can't let that happen.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.141
I understand, and I trust your
word, Sergeant, but I'm unable

27:55.174 --> 27:58.144
to take punitive action
until there is a ruling.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.712
However,

27:59.746 --> 28:01.981
I will have
the Delta Force commander

28:02.014 --> 28:04.250
reassign Sergeant Smith,
get him off this base.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.987
Thank you, sir.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.457
Respectfully, I'm proud
of the work that I do here.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.360
And I won't have it compromised
by someone like him.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.063
I'm very sorry this
happened, Sergeant.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.866
I'm more enraged, sir.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.367
But thank you.

28:22.902 --> 28:25.104
Dismissed.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.276
Captain?

28:31.410 --> 28:34.246
Suit up,
meet me on the flight line.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.782
Yes, sir.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.485
Can you imagine
faking your own death?

28:39.518 --> 28:42.354
Having your family mourn
something that isn't even real?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.224
Goundry was on our side
when he got in the CIA.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.459
He made those sacrifices
for his country.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.361
Yeah, and then he turned.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.331
So he abandoned
his family for what?

28:52.364 --> 28:54.066
Hey.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.502
(sighs)

28:56.535 --> 28:58.404
What I asked,
about moving in--

28:58.437 --> 29:00.239
I know that I sprang it on you.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.507
What does that have
to do with...?

29:01.540 --> 29:02.508
Just hear me out.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.812
I realize that I'm...

29:05.845 --> 29:09.081
kind of the closest thing that
you have to family right now.

29:09.115 --> 29:12.484
Porter, M.D., getting
psychoanalytical on me.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.787
Your dad walked out on you.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.989
I...

29:17.023 --> 29:18.390
would never do that to you.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.260
You know that, right?

29:21.293 --> 29:23.996
Of course.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.232
That's all I wanted to say.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.470
What?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.538
Family.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.141
Do you remember Goundry's
cover name in Somalia?

29:35.174 --> 29:38.110
Yeah. Bucky.
When I went to
his sister's diner,

29:38.144 --> 29:40.279
there was a board
with specials on it.

29:40.312 --> 29:43.115
"Bucky's Burger"
was one of them.
Okay.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.316
So he must have chosen
his cover name

29:44.350 --> 29:46.018
in reference
to something in his life.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.486
There was also Senoia Salad.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.521
Senoia-- the town
where he was born.
Yeah.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.457
The menu items are named

29:51.490 --> 29:53.960
after things that matter
to his family.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.327
Could be clues
to where he would hide.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.496
Like you said, the
smallest details,

29:57.529 --> 29:59.866
all the way back to
when he was a kid.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.533
I will pull up
the diner's website

30:01.567 --> 30:04.170
and see what else
there is. Yup.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.474
"My husband has not
attended services

30:08.507 --> 30:11.377
at a mosque in over ten years."

30:14.446 --> 30:17.016
I don't know about this.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.484
Everything you're
saying is true.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.519
And it's what
they need to hear.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.222
What if he was devout?
Would it matter?

30:23.255 --> 30:25.892
Not to me, but it matters
for public perception.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.867
"We decided we didn't want
to raise our son, Max,

30:34.901 --> 30:35.868
in the Muslim faith."

30:35.902 --> 30:37.503
Also true.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.872
It just sounds like
I'm defending Jimmy,

30:39.906 --> 30:41.507
and he shouldn't need
to be defended.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.409
He hasn't done anything wrong.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.112
We are not trying to
be subtle here, Jess.

30:46.145 --> 30:49.548
We are trying to make this
smear campaign go away.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.418
Do you want your husband coming
home to a hero's welcome,

30:52.451 --> 30:54.921
or to people doubting
his patriotism?

30:54.954 --> 30:57.423
I just want him to come home.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.999
GALLO:
I forget sometimes

31:07.033 --> 31:09.035
you need to keep your
flight hours current, too.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.369
Is that why you
brought me up?

31:10.402 --> 31:12.304
That's part of it.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.473
But I realized
something, Captain.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.442
I read through your file.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.310
Read what happened in Mes Aynak.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.114
That's got nothing
to do with anything.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.051
You don't even
know it, do you?

31:25.084 --> 31:28.054
You are knee-deep in PTSD.

31:37.029 --> 31:40.399
Razor Two confirmed. No
vehicles within ten klicks.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.634
Proceed to blow the IEDs.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.470
Charge set?

31:44.503 --> 31:45.972
Yes, Sergeant.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.573
I let the delay long enough

31:47.606 --> 31:49.075
for us to get behind that berm.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.476
All right, fellas,
let's fall back.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.391
Sergeant, you won't need
binocs to see the explosion.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.227
The charge I left will give
us some nice fireworks.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.562
About 20 seconds
before...
Someone's approaching.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.601
It's a kid.
He's almost in the blast zone!

32:15.634 --> 32:17.603
Gallo, no!
Stop!

32:17.636 --> 32:18.470
Stop!
Gallo!

32:18.504 --> 32:20.272
Stop!

32:20.306 --> 32:22.341
(explosion rumbling)

32:22.374 --> 32:24.576
*

32:39.658 --> 32:44.330
And when I saw Hendrix in that
casket, something... snapped.

32:45.664 --> 32:49.301
I didn't see
the connection before.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.237
Someone else I couldn't save.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.575
PTSD can hit you
when you least expect it.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.444
But you can't deny it.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.546
It is about coping.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.548
You should go talk
to Mental Health.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.717
Get the help you need before you
do something else you regret.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.586
I hear you, Colonel.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.555
Lima Charlie.
Good.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.091
You showed leadership today,
Captain,

33:12.124 --> 33:14.193
with Sergeant Cho.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.428
I've decided to take you
off disciplinary status

33:16.462 --> 33:17.596
as long as Mental Health

33:17.629 --> 33:18.597
clears you, too.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.099
Thank you, sir.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.669
All right,
you have the controls.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.138
I have the controls.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.420
"Bream Branch Brisket."

33:41.453 --> 33:43.222
MADANI:
That's another hit.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.092
Okay, that's six
location references.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.793
You know,
we make a pretty good team here.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.728
Yeah.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.531
Okay, so they all cluster
around this state park,

33:52.564 --> 33:54.366
pretty much in the
middle of nowhere.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.734
PORTER:
Springer Mountain.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.073
That one right there.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.642
Okay, that lake was
in a family photo

34:03.675 --> 34:06.078
in the diner.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.715
A CIA field specialist like
Goundry is trained to hide...

34:09.748 --> 34:11.483
MADANI: Someplace hard to find,
hard to access,

34:11.517 --> 34:14.620
someplace he knows well.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.588
PORTER: This has to be
where Goundry is.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.459
(lock clicks)

34:20.492 --> 34:22.494
Heard you weren't
grounded anymore.

34:22.528 --> 34:23.562
Yep.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.631
What's up?

34:25.664 --> 34:27.733
Just came from
the SARC specialist's office.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.268
What'd she say?

34:29.301 --> 34:31.837
They start
the investigation today.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.373
I cut his head with a bottle
when I pushed him off.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.108
Gonna be hard
to explain that away.

34:36.142 --> 34:37.443
COOGAN:
Hey.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.744
What's this I hear
about my best sniper

34:38.777 --> 34:40.812
getting transferred?
Not now, man.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.182
Some bull about
sexual harassment.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.184
Look, you don't get to ask us

34:45.217 --> 34:46.452
to treat you like
one of the guys

34:46.485 --> 34:48.354
and then run and bitch
about it when we do.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.455
Back off, Sergeant.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.357
It wasn't harassment,
it was assault.

34:51.390 --> 34:54.293
You know the difference?
What? That's not
what Smitty told me.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.461
Yeah. Smitty runs to you,

34:55.494 --> 34:57.463
and you assume
he's telling you the truth.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.464
Big surprise.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.271
I had no idea.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.605
Well, now you do.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.312
So you two lovebirds have
another lead on Goundry. Really?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.314
Wasn't it Nora's insight
that got us

35:15.347 --> 35:16.448
into the last fiasco?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.883
All due respect, sir,

35:17.916 --> 35:19.485
no one here's
batting a thousand.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.453
We're confident
on this intel.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.554
Comes from
Goundry's sister.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.156
Yeah, who misled us
the last time.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.557
Why would we trust
a word she says?

35:25.591 --> 35:28.794
Because she left this lead
behind unintentionally.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.265
You saw her interrogation, sir.
You know her history.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.601
Does she seem like the type
who would knowingly aid

35:35.634 --> 35:37.403
and abet a traitor?

35:37.436 --> 35:39.471
Deidre loves her brother.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.408
We stand by the person we love,
even if we don't...

35:42.441 --> 35:44.376
fully understand their motives.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.778
Get to the point, Porter.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
Deidre used references
in her menu

35:49.215 --> 35:50.749
that were comforting reminders
of her brother.

35:50.782 --> 35:51.750
Without knowing it,

35:51.783 --> 35:53.585
she left behind clues.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.621
They're place names, all
around Springer Mountain.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.256
PORTER:
It turns out the family

35:57.289 --> 35:58.624
had a cabin there,
and Goundry knows it

35:58.657 --> 35:59.891
like the back of his hand.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.627
It has limited
road access,

36:01.660 --> 36:04.563
rough terrain;
it's the perfect place to hide.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.335
Outstanding work.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.402
We need to move
fast on this.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.471
I will circle back with the FBI
regarding strategy.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.441
All right.

36:17.276 --> 36:20.246
Hey, uh, Madani, Porter,
I was just looking for you.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.381
I want to make sure you're both
aware of the press conference

36:22.414 --> 36:23.715
Mrs. Kam is doing
this afternoon.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.584
I'll be there to
show my support.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.619
It's already been cleared
through the P.A.O., so if you...

36:27.653 --> 36:29.455
Colonel, a moment.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.689
Spread the word.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.424
Yes, sir.

36:35.327 --> 36:38.597
Hey, uh, thanks for
sticking up for me in there.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.865
Meant a lot.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.600
I do what I do.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.901
And that stuff you said

36:42.934 --> 36:45.237
about standing by
the people you love...

36:48.039 --> 36:52.444
I don't really have anyone else
that stands by me like that.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.713
I mean, yeah,
in the field, but...

36:54.746 --> 36:58.016
in life, just you.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.686
So...

37:00.719 --> 37:02.521
let's do it.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.592
Let's move in together.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.494
Yeah?

37:08.527 --> 37:10.562
Yeah.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.738
(reporters murmuring,
cameras clicking)

37:24.510 --> 37:27.379
Hey. Hold up.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.415
Coogan told me what happened
with Sergeant Cho.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.649
Yeah.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.751
Well, is she all right?
I will be.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.286
This is so messed up.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.454
I am so sorry.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.622
Well, he won't
do it again.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.390
Thanks to you
stepping forward.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.292
We'll have your back on this.
The whole unit will.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.328
I know.
And, hey,

37:42.361 --> 37:43.862
make sure you keep talking
to someone, okay?

37:43.895 --> 37:44.963
Get the help you need.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.065
Whoa. Is this the PTSD speech?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.335
'Cause Haskins gave it
to me already.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.471
The whole thing? Damn.
He must have that memorized.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.473
So is that why
you shoved Porter,

37:54.506 --> 37:56.041
got yourself grounded?

37:56.074 --> 37:57.376
PTSD?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.779
Something like that.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.349
I'm gonna go talk
to someone myself.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.455
So I misread everything.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.823
Didn't realize you were
going through something.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.725
Is that an apology I hear?

38:13.759 --> 38:15.361
Don't push your luck.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.030
We have another lead
on Goundry's location.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.032
This one looks a lot better.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.001
Won't be long till
we've got him, then.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.636
Yeah.

38:24.670 --> 38:28.407
Well, whatever happens,
we're in it together.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.310
(door opens)

38:34.580 --> 38:37.749
So you have read it now.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.751
You see what they say.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.453
You are not one of them.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.391
They say I'm like you.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.726
Your country
has given up on you.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.869
JIMMY:
You're wrong.

38:59.705 --> 39:03.074
I don't... want your favors.

39:03.108 --> 39:06.612
I don't want this room.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.448
I'm never giving up on them.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.651
And I am never making
your damn video.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.462
Hey.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.830
Hey.
(chuckles)

39:24.863 --> 39:26.665
Just wanted to
wish you good luck.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.999
You're gonna do great.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.001
I haven't decided
what I'm gonna say yet.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.471
That what this is?

39:34.473 --> 39:36.141
Yeah. Um...

39:36.174 --> 39:38.810
But I...

39:38.844 --> 39:39.978
What?

39:40.011 --> 39:41.713
I don't know.

39:41.747 --> 39:45.417
So, have you made
a decision yet?

39:45.451 --> 39:46.818
About moving in?

39:46.852 --> 39:49.988
I, uh, told him yes.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.524
(chuckles) Which
feels kind of crazy.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.594
But I asked myself
your question.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.596
Would Ian stand by me?

39:57.629 --> 39:59.631
And I think he would.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.668
It's time.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.569
Okay.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.605
You got this.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.674
*

40:08.707 --> 40:10.509
EDWARDS:
Good afternoon.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.211
It is my honor
to introduce Jessica Kam,

40:13.244 --> 40:15.213
wife of Sergeant Jimmy Kam.

40:15.246 --> 40:19.585
Mrs. Kam, like all military
spouses, is an unsung hero.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.587
And she has a few words
she'd like to share with you.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.022
*

40:24.055 --> 40:26.692
(cameras clicking)

40:29.895 --> 40:34.833
Recently, my husband's loyalty
has been questioned

40:34.866 --> 40:36.935
by some members of the press.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.070
They have labeled him a Muslim

40:39.104 --> 40:42.674
and a traitor to this...

40:46.645 --> 40:48.614
I'm sorry.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.749
Um, I'm sorry.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.084
Uh, these words have
the best intentions,

40:53.118 --> 40:56.588
but this isn't the way
to stand by Jimmy.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.924
You want to know
who my husband is,

40:58.957 --> 41:00.592
I will tell you.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.495
He's Muslim.

41:03.529 --> 41:09.034
He is Muslim,
and he is a proud soldier.

41:09.067 --> 41:12.203
Like thousands of other soldiers
that serve alongside him

41:12.237 --> 41:13.539
every day.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.708
He is a loving husband

41:16.742 --> 41:19.678
and a caring father.

41:21.079 --> 41:24.983
And I know
that you will bring him home.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.853
*

41:34.660 --> 41:38.630
* Hallelujah

41:38.664 --> 41:41.667
* Higher.

41:45.571 --> 41:48.707
(panting)

41:48.740 --> 41:49.741
(chuckles softly)
