WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:08.515
What are you doing?

00:08.551 --> 00:11.360
In movies, when actors
go underwater,

00:11.395 --> 00:14.854
I like to hold my breath
to see if I'd survive.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.516
Okay, well, in that case,
I recommend watching

00:17.551 --> 00:18.950
<i>Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:19.986
( exhales loudly )

00:23.173 --> 00:25.857
KC, I just spoke with
the Organization,

00:25.893 --> 00:27.453
and it look like you're getting a
new partner for your next mission.

00:27.477 --> 00:30.728
I don't need
a new partner, okay?

00:30.764 --> 00:33.710
I am a strong, smart, independent,
self-sufficient woman who can stand on her own.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.911
Well, he's supposed to be
the real deal.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.318
Wait, he's a he?

00:38.055 --> 00:40.814
It's about time
I got a new partner.

00:40.849 --> 00:42.340
- So what's his name?
- Dexter.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.108
- How old is he?
- Around 18.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.961
- Oh? Long hair, short hair?
- Short hair.

00:45.996 --> 00:47.132
Okay, short hair, don't care.

00:47.156 --> 00:48.347
What's his cuteness level?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.414
Adorable.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.857
Score!

00:50.893 --> 00:52.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:52.377 --> 00:56.329
The last thing we need
is a repeat of Brett Willis.

00:56.365 --> 00:59.199
The Organization is not your own
personal dating service.

00:59.234 --> 01:01.460
Hey, look, I have
relationship goals.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.969
Like, to have one.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.048
So when do I get to meet him?

01:06.083 --> 01:07.808
Actually, he is here now.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.062
Oh, Dexter.

01:19.129 --> 01:22.906
Uh, please tell me
my new partner has a dog.

01:22.942 --> 01:24.791
Your new partner <i>is</i> a dog.

01:24.827 --> 01:27.235
Meet Dexter.

01:27.270 --> 01:28.887
Told you he was adorable.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.032
'Sup, dog?

01:32.067 --> 01:34.126
Try to keep it professional, KC.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.115
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:40.150 --> 01:43.310
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:43.387 --> 01:47.305
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:47.340 --> 01:51.326
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:51.362 --> 01:55.071
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:55.106 --> 01:57.165
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:57.201 --> 02:01.444
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:01.479 --> 02:05.298
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:05.334 --> 02:07.367
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:07.402 --> 02:09.644
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:09.679 --> 02:12.080
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:12.116 --> 02:13.940
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:13.975 --> 02:15.993
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:16.028 --> 02:18.069
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:18.104 --> 02:20.956
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:20.991 --> 02:22.068
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:22.092 --> 02:24.418
I keep it undercover.

02:24.453 --> 02:25.719
I keep it undercover.

02:29.258 --> 02:31.183
- ( Barking )
- Shut up, okay?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.530
Look, Marisa, I know you're hurting
about the breakup with Bobby,

02:36.565 --> 02:38.957
but we knew this was coming.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.743
And by we, I mean
everyone in school but you.

02:41.779 --> 02:43.019
( Barking )

02:43.054 --> 02:44.963
Would you shut up, please?

02:44.999 --> 02:46.873
Sorry, Marisa.
I wasn't talking to you.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.325
Look, all I'm saying is,

02:49.360 --> 02:51.253
there's someone better
out there for you.

02:51.288 --> 02:54.264
- ( Barking )
- Hey, enough is enough.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.699
Bark one more time, I will make
you sorry you were ever born.

02:57.752 --> 03:00.186
You know what, Marisa?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.838
I'm gonna call you back,
all right? Okay.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.001
Hey, let go of my shirt.

03:06.036 --> 03:07.356
Let go.
This is my favorite shirt.

03:15.979 --> 03:17.529
The dumb dog hates me.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.606
Why would you say that?

03:19.641 --> 03:21.849
Because he purposely knocked
over my science project

03:21.885 --> 03:24.168
and broke it,
he's been pushing me around,

03:24.204 --> 03:25.573
and he just stole
my favorite shirt.

03:25.597 --> 03:27.497
Is this some kind of punishment?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.030
Bunless you're a fireman, g
peror a sheep herder. Og,

03:32.054 --> 03:33.078
Or a taxidermist.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.188
( Dexter barks )

03:35.223 --> 03:37.399
KC, Dexter isn't just a dog.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.010
He's a top-level agent
for the Organization.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.270
Now, your mission is to
bust up a ring of criminals

03:42.306 --> 03:44.373
who are smuggling
dangerous and illegal fireworks

03:44.408 --> 03:46.299
and selling them
on the black market.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.092
Why's it always gotta be
the black market?

03:48.128 --> 03:49.330
Why can't it be the pink market?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.046
Or the green market?

03:51.081 --> 03:52.222
As I was saying...

03:54.467 --> 03:57.068
not only can Dexter
sniff out the fireworks,

03:57.103 --> 03:59.662
but he can also sniff out liars.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.381
Know what else
can sniff out a liar?

04:01.416 --> 04:03.308
- What?
- A lie detector.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.036
And it doesn't steal your shirt.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.397
Okay, all right, you two
are off to a funky start.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.985
I suggest that you spend
some time together,

04:11.009 --> 04:12.433
and earn each other's trust.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.428
Oh, yeah, for sure.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.049
We can start by going to the
mall and getting me a new shirt,

04:17.073 --> 04:19.132
right after he's done
fertilizing the flower bed.

04:19.168 --> 04:20.292
Come on, man!

04:23.438 --> 04:26.181
Yeah, I think we're gonna
need a bigger bag.

04:26.216 --> 04:27.794
Oh, no, honey.
You gonna need a bigger bag.

04:27.818 --> 04:28.818
That's your partner.

04:35.683 --> 04:37.934
Mom, can we just move?

04:44.934 --> 04:48.127
Okay, I know your dad's
too cheap to buy you a car,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.255
but are you riding
a horse to school?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.574
( Forced laughter )

04:52.609 --> 04:54.025
This is Dexter.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.446
An emotional support dog.

04:57.481 --> 05:00.656
Oh, thank goodness you are here.

05:00.692 --> 05:03.535
Bobby dumped me for Anna,
and I feel like such a fool.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.261
And you look like one, too.

05:05.297 --> 05:07.305
Girl, get up.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.257
He is my partner on a mission.

05:09.293 --> 05:10.934
We're supposed to bond together

05:10.969 --> 05:12.660
but he's practically untrained.

05:12.696 --> 05:14.304
Really? Sit, boy.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
Lie down.

05:21.796 --> 05:22.796
Sit up.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.108
Pick me out a new look
for summer.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.449
Nice choice, Dexter. Up top.

05:37.979 --> 05:40.121
( Clears throat )

05:40.156 --> 05:42.156
As usual, you know how to
talk to boys and I don't.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.214
Eight ball, corner pocket.

05:51.459 --> 05:54.177
Oh, what the heck.
All balls, all pockets.

06:00.868 --> 06:02.485
Hold on to your puffs, Judy,

06:02.520 --> 06:04.662
'cause I have got
a surprise for you.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.791
If it's you asking me to do your
math homework for you again,

06:07.826 --> 06:08.942
it's not a surprise.

06:11.279 --> 06:13.363
I was going through my room,

06:13.398 --> 06:17.292
and I found these great
dolls that I have outgrown,

06:17.327 --> 06:19.669
and since my parents
refuse to give me

06:19.671 --> 06:21.646
a little sibling of my own
to pass them down to...

06:21.681 --> 06:23.521
Something about learning
from their mistakes...

06:25.928 --> 06:29.370
I thought I would
give them to you.

06:29.405 --> 06:31.022
Oh, wow.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.724
That's so nice of you.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.842
These dolls are amazing.

06:34.877 --> 06:36.389
I feel like the luckiest
girl in the world.

06:36.413 --> 06:39.514
I am just glad they found
a good new home.

06:39.550 --> 06:40.830
Yep, they found a good new home.

06:44.596 --> 06:46.104
In the landfill.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.283
Look, Mom, I tried to
get along with Dexter.

06:50.318 --> 06:52.502
I really did try,
but he is impossible.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.182
You know the phrase
"my dog ate my homework"?

06:54.206 --> 06:56.790
He literally ate my homework.

06:56.825 --> 06:58.574
And everybody else's
in history class.

06:58.609 --> 07:01.286
And then, he decided to
fertilize my foot,

07:01.321 --> 07:03.579
out of nowhere.

07:03.614 --> 07:06.466
I'm pretty sure
it came out of somewhere.

07:06.501 --> 07:08.359
And the worst part is,

07:08.394 --> 07:10.153
I know he did it on purpose.

07:10.188 --> 07:11.871
I hate him, I hate him,
I hate him.

07:11.906 --> 07:13.881
KC, do you hear yourself?

07:13.917 --> 07:15.808
Yes, I just said, I hate him,

07:15.843 --> 07:16.843
I hate him, I hate him.

07:18.622 --> 07:21.039
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.685
This is ridiculous.
I'm fighting with a dog.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.593
No, you're fighting
with an agent.

07:25.628 --> 07:28.107
Do you think I get along with
every agent I get partnered with?

07:28.131 --> 07:30.724
Like Beverly or your father?

07:30.759 --> 07:32.742
Yeah, but I don't need him.

07:32.777 --> 07:34.519
I said the same thing.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.972
And 20 years later, here we are.

07:38.007 --> 07:42.443
Look, Mom, I have an informant
who will give me

07:42.479 --> 07:44.140
alll can take them downeed
abowithout Dexter's help. k

07:44.164 --> 07:46.322
Let's not forget, I am the one
who single-handedly

07:46.357 --> 07:49.376
taught Dad how to Nae-Nae.

07:49.411 --> 07:52.745
Okay, right now, it's just one
Nae, but we're working on it.

07:52.781 --> 07:57.366
KC, the Organization
assigned you to Dexter.

07:57.402 --> 07:59.928
So like it or not, you need to
work with him on this mission.

07:59.963 --> 08:03.364
Not!

08:03.400 --> 08:05.433
You gave me an option,
like it or not.

08:05.468 --> 08:07.101
I choose not.

08:13.793 --> 08:14.979
Judy, just came to see
how you're getting along

08:15.003 --> 08:17.070
with my old dolls.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.120
Where are they?

08:18.156 --> 08:19.472
Over there.

08:19.508 --> 08:20.823
In the trash can?

08:23.520 --> 08:26.154
You threw away my dolls?

08:26.189 --> 08:29.316
No. I threw away my dolls.

08:29.351 --> 08:31.511
But you can have them back
if they mean so much to you.

08:32.704 --> 08:34.454
No, no, I don't want them back.

08:34.489 --> 08:37.073
I just want you
to play with them.

08:37.108 --> 08:39.376
And possibly just text me
pictures with funny captions

08:39.411 --> 08:41.619
so I can see what they're up to,

08:41.654 --> 08:44.180
and how much you love them.

08:44.216 --> 08:46.816
Like, for instance, Samantha.

08:46.851 --> 08:49.377
She was the first woman
to shop on Mars.

08:49.413 --> 08:52.747
And this hot tub.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.134
I saved my tooth fairy money
for over a year to buy this.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.578
I even pulled out
two adult teeth

08:58.655 --> 09:00.714
so I could afford the one
with the working jets.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.906
That's right. Caps.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.603
I will never eat
corn on the cob again,

09:06.638 --> 09:09.556
but my dolls' wet and wild
spring break was legendary.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.165
Legendary!

09:14.388 --> 09:16.880
How could you just
throw all this away?

09:16.915 --> 09:19.540
They're boring.

09:19.576 --> 09:20.803
Plus, I imagined them
screaming in horror

09:20.827 --> 09:23.953
as I closed the trash lid,
and it really made me laugh.

09:23.989 --> 09:25.963
( Evil chuckling )

09:25.998 --> 09:28.215
Boring?

09:28.251 --> 09:30.276
If you think that
these dolls are boring,

09:30.311 --> 09:32.696
then you must not be
using them right.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.848
I mean, these dolls
entertained me my whole life.

09:35.884 --> 09:38.735
To be fair, staring at
the ceiling fan entertains you.

09:42.924 --> 09:44.240
Are you listening?

09:44.275 --> 09:45.700
I'm sorry. What?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.324
All right, my informant said
the illegal fireworks

09:53.360 --> 09:54.761
are being stored in here.
We're going in.

09:54.785 --> 09:56.778
Wait. Shouldn't we wait
for Agent Dexter?

09:56.813 --> 09:58.846
- I left him in the van.
- You what?

09:58.881 --> 10:00.731
I left him in the van. What?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.718
I rolled down the windows
and left the radio on.

10:03.753 --> 10:05.255
What can I say,
the dog likes smooth jazz.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.755
But the whole point
was to use the dog

10:07.790 --> 10:09.657
to sniff out the fireworks.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.834
Ernie, will you forget
the dang dog?

10:11.869 --> 10:13.653
Look, the Organization
has been solving cases

10:13.688 --> 10:15.530
without the help of
the animal kingdom

10:15.565 --> 10:17.115
since the beginning of time.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.083
Actually, the Organization
was founded...

10:19.119 --> 10:21.677
Ernie, that is not the point!

10:21.712 --> 10:24.914
Can we please forget
Dex Doggy Dog?

10:24.949 --> 10:26.466
I got this. This is my get.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.034
Let's go.

10:31.248 --> 10:33.205
Nobody move!

10:33.241 --> 10:36.426
There's nobody in here.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.388
Just like your last
birthday party all over again.

10:40.031 --> 10:42.207
Looks like you got some
wrong information, KC.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.408
Oh, really? What do you
call that?

10:44.443 --> 10:47.152
Just like my informant said,

10:47.188 --> 10:48.228
the fireworks are in here.

10:55.705 --> 10:58.589
Doesn't look
very firework-y to me.

10:58.624 --> 11:03.819
That's because
the fireworks are...

11:03.854 --> 11:05.780
hidden inside of these
phony antiquities.

11:11.913 --> 11:14.447
Obviously, they're not gonna
put the fireworks in the top one

11:14.482 --> 11:16.007
in case it gets searched.

11:16.042 --> 11:19.027
That would be just dumb.

11:19.062 --> 11:21.142
We're dealing with high-class
criminals here, people.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.594
A very high-class criminal.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.311
I have never seen
a higher class of criminal.

11:36.346 --> 11:39.088
Call me crazy,

11:39.123 --> 11:42.942
but I'm starting to think
those are real antiquities.

11:42.977 --> 11:44.777
Please. If these were
real antiquities,

11:44.812 --> 11:47.813
then this packing slip
would say that...

11:47.849 --> 11:50.725
"Smithsonian Institute.
Ancient Egypt Exhibit.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.995
Fragile. Priceless
and irreplaceable."

11:57.175 --> 12:00.176
Well, can I get a five up top

12:00.212 --> 12:02.732
for cracking the case of the missing
Egyptian antiquities? Yeah.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.478
KC, your behavior
was inexcusable.

12:10.513 --> 12:11.624
By cutting Dexter
out of the mission,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.590
you broke the agents'
code of conduct.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.734
Conduct? What about his conduct?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.188
Dexter's the one gettin' busy
with the pillow over there.

12:18.212 --> 12:20.746
See, this is the problem.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.057
You've never taken
Dexter seriously.

12:23.093 --> 12:25.251
You treat him like a dog,
and he's a ranking agent.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.453
And a Mr. Fuzzy Pants.

12:27.488 --> 12:29.047
Who's a Mr. Fuzzy Pants?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.082
You are. You are.

12:32.902 --> 12:36.679
Look, Mom, so I destroyed
a few ancient artifacts.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.174
There's gonna be
new ancient artifacts.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.736
In 5,000 years, this will be
an ancient artifact.

12:43.771 --> 12:46.105
You wanna call
the Smithsonian now

12:46.141 --> 12:48.040
and tell 'em it's gonna be
a while or should I?

12:48.076 --> 12:51.527
Mom, it's not like you've
never made a mistake before.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.704
Letting that silo
in Zurich explode,

12:53.739 --> 12:55.956
or shooting that
Monrovian dignitary.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.391
Oh, having Ernie.

12:59.804 --> 13:02.104
If you had just brought
Dexter in with you

13:02.139 --> 13:04.164
to meet your informant,
Dexter would've alerted you

13:04.200 --> 13:06.458
that your informant was lying.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.211
Mom, it's not my fault, okay?

13:09.246 --> 13:10.432
I tried to get Dexter to come
in, but he wouldn't do it.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.172
- ( Barks )
- Lie!

13:12.208 --> 13:14.484
And what about the warehouse?

13:14.519 --> 13:16.077
If you had brought Dexter,

13:16.112 --> 13:17.698
he would've sniffed
the crate of artifacts

13:17.722 --> 13:19.964
and told you
there was no contraband.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.476
Again, Mom, Dexter refused
to get out of the van.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.094
( Barks )

13:25.129 --> 13:27.705
Lie, and an obvious one.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.399
We were there,
and we know that isn't true.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.035
I'm telling you,
the dog doesn't like me.

13:33.671 --> 13:34.720
No lie there.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.468
Honey, I'm sorry,
but you're off the case.

13:38.492 --> 13:39.625
What are you talking about?

13:39.661 --> 13:41.635
I have no choice.

13:41.671 --> 13:44.788
Dexter filed
a formal complaint against you.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.665
He's a dog.
He doesn't have thumbs.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.142
How did he file a complaint?

13:48.177 --> 13:50.695
I filed a grievance
on his behalf.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.814
I don't want his stellar
reputation sullied

13:52.849 --> 13:54.940
by your terrible behavior.

13:54.976 --> 13:57.043
Well, who's in charge
of the mission now?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.979
I am, and unlike you,
I am excited to be working

14:00.014 --> 14:03.232
with an agent
of Dexter's caliber.

14:03.268 --> 14:06.302
Aw, good for you.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.938
Don't forget to sniff his butt while
you're down there kissing it.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.271
( High-pitched voice ) I'm getting
ready for the prince's ball.

14:14.295 --> 14:16.453
I'm getting ready for an
important software conference

14:16.489 --> 14:19.732
in Toledo.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.843
Um, no, you're getting
ready for the prince's ball,

14:21.878 --> 14:23.761
so you can meet
a handsome suitor.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.639
Um, no. I wanna
focus on my career

14:26.674 --> 14:29.091
so I can buy my own condo.

14:29.126 --> 14:31.093
( Normal voice )
Judy, I told you,

14:31.128 --> 14:33.854
it is more fun if
they go to the same place.

14:33.890 --> 14:36.215
But besides, Marguerite
has to go to the ball

14:36.251 --> 14:37.958
because she is
the prince's girlfriend.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.553
Not anymore, she's not.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.030
The prince is breakin' up with her.
It's over.

14:43.065 --> 14:46.200
I like Pamela and her eye

14:46.236 --> 14:48.396
for lucrative, income-generating
investment properties.

14:50.940 --> 14:52.380
That is not even
what he sounds like.

14:56.053 --> 14:57.923
If you can't play with my dolls the way
that they are meant to be played with,

14:57.947 --> 14:59.713
then maybe you don't
deserve them.

14:59.749 --> 15:03.434
I am taking my dolls,
and I am going home.

15:05.913 --> 15:09.723
Finally. I thought I'd
never get rid of her.

15:09.759 --> 15:12.409
It's okay, Pam.
You've outgrown Marguerite.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.688
While she's all yakkin' about
princes, shoes, and hot tubs,

15:16.724 --> 15:18.383
you're gonna be the first
sister president

15:18.418 --> 15:19.418
in the Oval Office.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.168
Okay, I've tracked
the suspicious shipment

15:29.204 --> 15:31.020
to a warehouse off Riggs Road.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.706
We'll check it out tonight,
because unlike KC,

15:33.741 --> 15:35.874
I really am your partner.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.544
We're like Batman and Robin,
Bert and Ernie,

15:38.579 --> 15:40.755
- Turner and Hooch.
- ( barks )

15:40.790 --> 15:42.781
- No, you're Hooch.
- ( barks )

15:42.817 --> 15:44.358
- No, you are.
- ( barks )

15:44.394 --> 15:46.285
No, you are.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
Paw bump.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.690
That's my dog.

15:53.736 --> 15:56.270
Will you please get
that tail-chasin',

15:56.306 --> 15:58.013
big stinky bag of fleas
out of the kitchen?

15:58.048 --> 15:59.774
I'm reviewing
the mission with him.

15:59.809 --> 16:01.534
I was talking to the dog.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.345
No wonder he complained
about you.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.231
You have a terrible attitude.

16:07.266 --> 16:10.084
Yeah, well, you have
a terrible face.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.030
Your comebacks are even worse
than your attitude.

16:15.065 --> 16:16.385
I need some chips
for my sandwich.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.260
KC, what did you do
to my sandwich?

16:28.295 --> 16:30.813
Nothing!

16:30.848 --> 16:32.949
Oh, well, it didn't just
suddenly grow feet

16:32.984 --> 16:34.462
- and walk out of here.
- Dexter ate it.

16:34.486 --> 16:35.884
Oh, please.

16:35.919 --> 16:37.495
He did, I swear. He ate it.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.621
- ( Barks )
- You're lying.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.725
Who are you gonna trust, some
dumb dog or your dumb sister?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.210
I mean, your sister.
Look, I saw him.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.989
I saw him eat the whole thing,
and you know what?

16:46.013 --> 16:47.357
Now he's tryin'
to make me look bad.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.799
( Barks )

16:49.876 --> 16:52.826
So first he's not smart
enough to be your partner,

16:52.862 --> 16:55.480
and now he's
a sandwich-stealing mastermind?

16:55.515 --> 16:56.756
Get it together, KC.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.591
Get it together.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.209
Come on, buddy.

17:00.244 --> 17:01.719
Come on, Dexter.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.648
Okay, the fireworks
have to be in here.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.373
( Whining )

17:22.408 --> 17:24.450
You found it. Good job, boy.

17:24.486 --> 17:25.785
Keep checking the other crates.

17:25.820 --> 17:28.329
That's right.

17:28.364 --> 17:30.681
I completed the mission
that KC couldn't.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.333
Time to capture this one
for posterity.

17:36.948 --> 17:39.331
One more? Funny faces this time.

17:39.366 --> 17:40.366
Uh-oh.

17:48.542 --> 17:52.019
- ( Barking )
- What?

17:52.054 --> 17:54.071
Congratulation. You have
a hologram collar.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.290
( Barking )

17:56.326 --> 17:57.377
Look, I really don't
have time for this, okay?

17:57.401 --> 17:59.793
I happen to be typing

17:59.829 --> 18:02.655
a little formal complaint
about you.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.491
I find it highly inappropriate
that you show up to work naked.

18:10.081 --> 18:11.806
Wait a minute, is that...
Ernie's phone?

18:11.841 --> 18:15.009
Are you with Ernie?

18:15.044 --> 18:17.361
- ( Barks )
- Is Ernie in danger, boy?

18:17.396 --> 18:19.788
( Barks ) - Okay, are you
guys at the warehouse?

18:19.824 --> 18:22.183
( Barks ) - I'll go
contact the Organization,

18:22.260 --> 18:23.279
meet you there, and you
keep an eye out for Ernie.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.085
( Barking )

18:25.121 --> 18:27.232
Hey, look, I am not happy
about this situation either,

18:27.256 --> 18:30.224
but you know what? I'ma need you
to watch your language.

18:40.044 --> 18:42.595
Hey, boss, the boat
is pulling up now.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.090
All right, start
loading these crates.

18:44.114 --> 18:46.348
And then load this guy.

18:46.383 --> 18:48.223
We'll dump him overboard
when we hit open seas.

18:53.249 --> 18:55.466
Okay, man, when this is over,

18:55.501 --> 18:57.251
we really need to
discuss your dog breath.

18:57.286 --> 18:58.846
Your breath is hurtin'
my feelings, bro.

19:01.591 --> 19:03.991
All right, let's get this guy
on the boat and get outta here.

19:05.595 --> 19:08.062
( Whining )

19:08.139 --> 19:09.733
- Where'd this dog come from?
- Maybe he's lost.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.815
Hey, look, he really likes you.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.400
Can we keep him, boss?

19:13.435 --> 19:15.544
KC: Dexter, here, boy.

19:15.579 --> 19:18.622
Oh, Dexter, there you are.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.999
Bad doggy.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.668
I'm sorry.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.373
He just does not listen
to a thing I say. Watch.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.031
Sit.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.224
See, he doesn't listen
to anything I say.

19:29.259 --> 19:31.893
I had the same problem
with my dog.

19:31.929 --> 19:33.306
Have you tried lowering your voice
to sound more authoritative?

19:33.330 --> 19:34.563
Oh, really? Does that work?

19:34.599 --> 19:36.090
Did with my poodle.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.218
Are you kidding me right now?

19:39.253 --> 19:41.915
Look, I don't care about you or your
dumb dog. Take it and get outta here.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.515
No, no, no. He's not dumb.

19:44.592 --> 19:46.512
There is one trick
he does know how to do. Ready?

19:46.544 --> 19:48.744
Okay. Okay, Dexter. Go ahead.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.304
Rip his face off.

20:09.951 --> 20:10.951
( Whining )

20:13.863 --> 20:14.870
( stifled yell )

20:19.468 --> 20:21.410
Whoo hoo!

20:21.445 --> 20:23.879
Hey, man, you don't
wanna do that.

20:23.914 --> 20:25.542
We can talk about this.
There's gotta be a way out.

20:25.566 --> 20:27.132
Not for you, there's not.

20:32.423 --> 20:34.306
MAN: Freeze! Drop the gun. Now!

20:44.477 --> 20:46.452
( Whimpering )

20:46.487 --> 20:48.320
It's okay, Dexter. I got you.

20:50.691 --> 20:54.059
Thanks, Ernie.

20:54.095 --> 20:55.831
You know, I'm really glad the
Organization let Dexter recuperate here.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.679
It's been nice bonding with him.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.690
I'm just sorry
he couldn't stay longer.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.977
Isn't that right,
Mr. Fuzzy Pants?

21:03.012 --> 21:04.895
( Knocking on door )

21:04.931 --> 21:08.765
Well, it looks like
this is it, Agent Dexter.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.960
I'm really sorry about all those
bad things I said about you.

21:11.996 --> 21:15.289
To be honest, I guess I'm just
not really a dog person.

21:15.324 --> 21:17.433
Well, I'm not really
a person person.

21:19.636 --> 21:21.753
But you know what?
We did make a good team.

21:21.788 --> 21:24.006
Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

21:24.041 --> 21:26.291
All right, you know what?

21:26.326 --> 21:28.322
We're really gonna have to
talk about that doggy breath.

21:28.346 --> 21:29.773
You literally ate
everything in this house

21:29.797 --> 21:32.423
except for mints.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.658
All right, come on.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.434
( Whimpering )

21:35.469 --> 21:37.903
Wait. Before you go,
I wanna give you

21:37.938 --> 21:39.378
a little something
to remember me by.

21:42.877 --> 21:46.136
Lookin' good.

21:46.171 --> 21:49.047
I love you. I'm gonna miss you.

21:49.083 --> 21:51.850
I love you, I love you.

21:51.886 --> 21:54.703
I thought you were gonna keep it
professional this time, KC.

21:54.738 --> 21:56.972
This is Brett Willis
all over again.

22:00.428 --> 22:02.986
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
