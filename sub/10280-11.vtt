WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.541
Previously on ER:

00:07.575 --> 00:09.310
I can see his heartbeat.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.778
Are you hoping for a boy?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.513
I don't care.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.415
Are you, uh,
taking over now?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.483
Yeah.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.684
Yeah, look,
I feel much better.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.352
I don't really think
I need anything

00:18.386 --> 00:19.620
so I'm just going
to tough it out.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.821
Stick around until we are sure.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.223
We'll get to you soon, okay?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.657
How long was he waiting?

00:23.691 --> 00:24.658
I'm not sure.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.560
Luka thought
he had the flu.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.729
There was no
indication of leukemia.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.698
He presented with
a simple fever.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.534
Do you even care that that kid
is lying out there

00:33.567 --> 00:34.568
as good as dead?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.622 --> 00:55.856
Ready?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.758
Yeah.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.565
ANSPAUGH:
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:04.598 --> 01:08.702
Welcome to another fun-filled
Morbidity and Mortality.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.240
All right, medical record number
549274.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.276
R.K. was a previously healthy
19-year-old male

01:15.309 --> 01:17.578
who presented with fever,
myalgias

01:17.611 --> 01:19.380
and a temperature of 102.4.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.216
CBC revealed a white blood count
of 85,000

01:22.250 --> 01:26.687
with 60% blasts, consistent
with acute myelogenous leukemia.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.789
The attending physician?

01:28.822 --> 01:31.159
Dr. Kovac.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.378
Need some help?

02:24.412 --> 02:25.746
Nope, I got it.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.649
You need to stay out of this
room for a few days--

02:28.682 --> 02:30.251
no paint fumes, okay?

02:30.284 --> 02:31.652
Are you nesting?

02:31.685 --> 02:33.554
I'm painting a room.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.723
( chuckles ):
Nesting.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.426
Don't you have
to go to work?

02:38.459 --> 02:40.794
Chicago's toughest
female fire fighter

02:40.828 --> 02:43.631
braves burning buildings
and dirty diapers.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.598
Get out of here!

02:44.632 --> 02:45.966
Hey!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.536
I hope you don't treat the baby
like that.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.803
( laughter )

02:49.837 --> 02:51.305
You drew bloods

02:51.339 --> 02:52.940
but didn't send them
for two hours.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.742
We were swamped, and the young
man looked like he had the flu.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.410
I told her

02:56.444 --> 02:58.846
we can't do big workups on every
kid with the flu.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.349
Something all doctors say
at one time or another.

03:01.382 --> 03:05.419
The intubation problem--
Dr. Lewis.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.292
Because of the patient's
thrombocytopenia

03:11.325 --> 03:12.560
there was hemorrhage

03:12.593 --> 03:14.462
in the hypopharynx;
we attempted...

03:14.495 --> 03:16.497
But could you see the cords,
Dr. Kovac?

03:17.831 --> 03:19.600
No.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
Dr. Kovac felt
he'd performed

03:21.635 --> 03:23.571
an endotracheal intubation.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.705
"Felt"?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.609
He listened for breath sounds.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.345
Did he use an End Tidal CO2
detector to verify?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.013
When I walked
into the trauma room...

03:33.046 --> 03:34.948
I made a series
of critical errors

03:34.982 --> 03:36.917
including depriving
the patient of oxygen.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.952
I refused to let
Dr. Lewis take over

03:38.986 --> 03:42.490
and proceeded to put the shiley
in the pre-tracheal space.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.325
About the only thing I didn't do

03:44.358 --> 03:45.593
was put a plastic bag
over the guy's head

03:45.626 --> 03:46.994
and hit him with a brick.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.028
ANSPAUGH:
We're not trying
to assign guilt.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.897
In a teaching hospital

03:49.930 --> 03:52.900
we learn from complicated
cases and their outcomes.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.634
I had two hours' sleep.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.536
I was hungover.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.306
I should have admitted I
couldn't work, but I didn't.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.374
I was sloppy and arrogant;
Abby warned me

04:00.408 --> 04:01.909
the boy was sick

04:01.942 --> 04:03.577
and I ignored her.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.046
So, fire me, take my license,
shoot me, whatever

04:06.079 --> 04:08.849
but let's just not pretend
there's anything to learn here.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.552
I... I killed him.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.754
The patient isn't dead.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.358
Did anyone ever bother
to verify

04:17.391 --> 04:20.428
that there really are medical
schools in Croatia?

04:21.894 --> 04:23.331
Anyone?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.910
Don't let Romano get to you--
it only encourages him.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.579
They were more
than fair.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.714
I appreciate you
standing up for me.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.551
I told the truth.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.553
You tried to cover for me--
you didn't have to.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.555
It could have been
any one of us.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.459
Time to get back to work.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.427
( sighs )

04:53.461 --> 04:54.695
You think I still work here?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.697
Yeah, and your shift
started 20 minutes ago.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.098
You better check with Weaver.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.000
She just asked for you.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.939
28-year-old Chip Mealy,
insomnia times three days.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.708
He called 911
for insomnia?

05:07.741 --> 05:08.476
Big red taxi.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.743
Sorry.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.911
Also complains
of obsessive thoughts.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.079
Thanks.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.881
What's up, Chip?
Can't sleep?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.650
I took like, five of those
P.M. things-- nothing.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.652
Can you give me
something stronger?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.754
Five over-the-counter
sleeping pills?

05:20.788 --> 05:22.523
Were you trying
to hurt yourself?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.991
No. I was trying to sleep.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.827
You stopped sleeping three days
ago-- something happen?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.397
Problem with my girlfriend.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.831
Ah, okay.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.865
Sit tight, and we'll get
someone to talk to you.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.467
Can you just
give me a pill?

05:33.501 --> 05:34.702
No, you have to talk
to a psychiatrist first

05:34.735 --> 05:36.103
drugs second.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.872
Hey, Chuny, can you call
Psych for Mr. Mealy?

05:38.906 --> 05:40.508
Sure.
Thanks.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.411
Chuny... did you get
a beta HCG on Mrs. Wilkes?

05:43.411 --> 05:44.011
No.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.679
Why not?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.816
( chuckles ):
Because Mrs. Wilkes has a penis.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.783
( alarm beeps )

05:49.817 --> 05:50.918
Excuse me,
come back here.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.120
Oh, it's just
my cell phone.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.522
That's all right.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.623
I'm just going
to take a quick look.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.757
Look, I'm Dr. Pratt.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.991
Told you it's
my cell phone.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.427
Now, I have patients
to attend to.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.661
Let me look
inside the backpack.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.729
No, you don't need
to do that.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.863
Look, you're
new here, right?

06:02.896 --> 06:03.897
Well, doctors just get
to go through.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.998
Okay?
It's not okay!

06:05.032 --> 06:06.534
Did you hear
what I said?!

06:06.567 --> 06:08.035
Don't touch me!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

06:08.068 --> 06:09.903
Knock it off. It's okay.
He's a doctor.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.072
He set off the metal
detector, all right?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.741
Okay. What's the deal?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.944
Look...

06:16.977 --> 06:18.812
I was going to give it
to a real cop.

06:18.846 --> 06:22.182
I found it outside
behind a garbage can

06:22.215 --> 06:23.984
on my way inside.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.853
I figured somebody must've
stashed it coming in here

06:25.886 --> 06:29.990
and planned on picking it up
later, after they left.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.460
You have
a license for this?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.161
I told you, I found it.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.863
Well, I'm not going
to leave it outside.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.098
Sir, you're carrying
a concealed, unlicensed weapon.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.000
I'm going to have
to call the Chicago P.D.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.669
WOMAN:
Got a drive-by out here.
Need a doc.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.003
Look, keep the damn gun, okay?

06:43.036 --> 06:44.738
Hey, where's he going?
Whoa, whoa, hey.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.507
He's not going anywhere,
he works here.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.477
You got the gun;
just get his name
and information

06:49.477 --> 06:50.511
leave it at that.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.712
Ayudenos, por favor-- ayudenos.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.681
No, no, don't move him.
Que paso?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.083
El se cayo de un arbol con la
cerucha electrica en sus manos.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.851
Airway's good.
What's his name?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.753
I don't now. I just hired them
to cut down a dead tree.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.555
What happened?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.557
He was on a branch starting
his chainsaw and he slipped.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.858
He fell about 20 feet
onto my roof.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.059
And you just
drove him in?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.227
Why didn't you call 911?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.696
I thought this
would be faster.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.030
Pulse is 90.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.732
Let's get a C-collar
and a backboard.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.533
( mumbling weakly )

07:12.566 --> 07:14.167
Todo esta bien.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.605
Mr. Gilman complains of chest
pain and shortness of breath

07:17.638 --> 07:18.972
during sex with his wife.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.007
Sex with his wife?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.008
B.P. 130/82.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.576
How old is he?
93.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.512
One, two...

07:24.512 --> 07:25.813
Koko?!

07:25.846 --> 07:26.847
Dr. Kovac, could you give
us a hand?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.584
Ready?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.985
Yeah.
Go.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.887
Koko?

07:33.921 --> 07:36.557
She's on her way,
Mr. Gilman... his wife.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.726
Start a nitroglycerin drip;
20 mikes per minute.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.827
Gallant.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.529
Passing notes in class, Gallant?

07:41.529 --> 07:44.798
Aw, it's from Harkins.
She's going home today.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.067
I've been helping her keep up
with her assigned reading.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.702
You still need me?

07:48.736 --> 07:49.169
No.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.971
Oh--

07:51.004 --> 07:52.773
but could you check a post-
intubation film in the ICU?

07:52.806 --> 07:53.574
Patient's name?

07:53.607 --> 07:54.842
Exposed bone

07:54.875 --> 07:57.545
multiple abrasions
to scalp and face.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.813
I asked them if they knew
what they were doing.
( gasping )

07:59.847 --> 08:01.749
Do you speak Spanish?

08:01.782 --> 08:02.750
No.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.851
( screams )

08:03.884 --> 08:04.985
Oh, my God, this is bad.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.754
I have to go call my husband.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.989
Pelvis is stable but very tender
at the A.S.I.S.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.057
Probably a fracture.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.292
Dr. Pratt, these guys

08:12.325 --> 08:14.562
keep insisting that
we come get you.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.863
Prep the chest and open

08:15.896 --> 08:17.698
a 32 French.
I understand

08:17.731 --> 08:19.166
you blew off Officer
Robbins, Dr. Pratt.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.901
Later. Can't you see
I'm busy?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.270
Jerry, page ortho and surgery,
and keep the militia out?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.238
Get someone in
here who speaks more
Spanish than we do.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.239
I need to speak
with him.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.575
You need to get out of here.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.909
Okay, guys. Come on, let's go.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.879
( moaning )

08:31.912 --> 08:33.746
It's not what you think.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.317
( man crying )

08:37.350 --> 08:38.719
Chip?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.120
Chip, it can't be
that bad.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.621
Yeah, it is.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.756
Nobody's come to
talk to you yet?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.759
No. I just want
to go to sleep.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.195
Okay, okay. I'll see
what's keeping them.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.897
There should be a straight
line from the main...

08:49.930 --> 08:50.831
Whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

08:50.864 --> 08:54.134
What are you doing?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.969
I never know what they mean
when they say "square face."

08:56.003 --> 08:57.304
Obviously, it's not true
mathematically

08:57.337 --> 08:58.105
but I think your face
is quadrate enough

08:58.138 --> 08:59.907
to be called square.

08:59.940 --> 09:00.941
Sorry.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.610
She's one of my Mathletes.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.612
Anastasia, you're going to have
to go over there

09:04.645 --> 09:05.979
and sit with the rest
of the team.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.180
"Mathlete"?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.949
Yeah, she's on
the math team.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.318
They compete in math
tournaments.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.253
Ah, yeah. We used
to call them "geeks."

09:13.286 --> 09:14.722
What's she on?

09:14.755 --> 09:17.124
Tox screen hasn't
come back yet.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.893
How many cubic inches
in the E.R.?

09:19.927 --> 09:23.330
Is, uh, my face square?

09:25.132 --> 09:30.270
Hi. I'm looking for a portable
chest film on Moriguchi.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.940
Dr. Weaver coming back up?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.174
She's a little busy.

09:37.945 --> 09:42.716
You should pull the tube
back two centimeters.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.852
Just write the order.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.120
How's Kendrick doing?
Who?

09:47.154 --> 09:49.990
Teenager; presented with flu

09:50.023 --> 09:51.091
but it was leukemia.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.359
They think he needs

09:52.392 --> 09:53.827
dialysis now.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.904
Mrs. Kendrick?
I'm Dr. Kovac.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.274
I treated Rick when
he first came to the E.R.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.845
I've wanted to meet you.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.755
( sighs )

10:21.789 --> 10:24.191
I'm so sorry about your son.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.935
He was such
a funny kid.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.071
He'd have been
a good man.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.676
Did he know about
the leukemia?

10:42.710 --> 10:46.980
No. By the time the tests
came back, he was unconscious.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.251
Was he afraid?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.920
I don't think so.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.455
As he was going under
with the medicine

10:55.488 --> 10:57.257
he, he made a joke.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.995
He smiled and told Laura

11:02.029 --> 11:05.833
she could sell her engagement
ring if she needed the money.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.068
That's Rick.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.872
A little humor to get him
through the day.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.006
Dr. Kovac?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.909
Excuse me.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.945
Sure.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.387
What are you doing?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.456
Your own private M & M
with the kid's mother?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.058
She wanted to know
how her son died.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.960
One word: peacefully.
Leave it at that.

11:32.993 --> 11:33.961
She deserves to know that...

11:33.994 --> 11:34.962
What?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.129
What, the truth?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.798
The truth is,
you killed her son.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.034
You going
to tell her that?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.937
The word you're looking for
is "No." Come here.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.910
Look, you want
to flagellate yourself

11:49.943 --> 11:52.012
in front of your colleagues,
that's one thing

11:52.045 --> 11:54.848
but you admit guilt to this
woman, and who suffers, huh?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.016
Huh? Not you.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.018
What is she going to do,
take your car?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.853
Her lawyer slaps the county

11:59.887 --> 12:01.955
and this hospital with
a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.090
Our premiums skyrocket

12:03.123 --> 12:04.792
and where's that money
come from?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.994
Cutbacks in personnel
and essential equipment.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.428
Affecting whom? The patients.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.163
So... you control your emotions

12:10.197 --> 12:14.868
or you will harm more patients
than just this one.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.005
All right, I'll tell you what.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.372
You're off
for the rest of the day.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.407
I'm fine.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.109
Go home.
Oh-- and if I see you

12:22.142 --> 12:28.916
with this patient's family
again, you're fired.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.387
Look, I know
you're on the edge.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.956
Not sleeping
makes you feel crazy.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.058
I know how that is,
but Psych's backed up.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.827
We can't give you
any meds

12:39.827 --> 12:41.194
until someone's
seen you.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.462
It's a liability thing

12:42.495 --> 12:44.197
because you took
pills earlier.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.366
I know it wasn't
a suicide attempt, but...

12:46.399 --> 12:47.968
( crying ):
Oh, God.

12:48.001 --> 12:52.005
We'll get you something
to help you sleep soon.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.508
Everyone will hate me.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.846
Why?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.852
Why will everyone
hate you?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.321
Did you do something?

13:08.355 --> 13:10.590
To your girlfriend?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.492
No.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.862
What?

13:14.862 --> 13:17.430
What happened?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.433
( breathing deeply )

13:20.467 --> 13:22.970
She walked in on me.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.039
With someone else,
another woman?

13:26.073 --> 13:28.241
No.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.577
I don't think she realized.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.512
Another man?

13:36.049 --> 13:39.386
He's only ten.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.055
Who?

13:42.089 --> 13:45.458
Her son.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.460
You were...

13:47.494 --> 13:51.031
Did you do something
to him?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.033
No.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.268
I was going to, but...

13:55.302 --> 13:58.305
I would have,
but she walked in.

13:58.338 --> 14:02.209
I don't want
to be like this.

14:02.242 --> 14:06.213
I don't know if I could
have stopped myself.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.083
What happened?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.118
Lost the pulse.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.119
Still v-tach.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.486
Charging to 300.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.923
Bag him on 100%,
push an amp of Epi.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.124
Clear.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.525
Got a rhythm.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.559
Good femoral pulse.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.660
Welcome back,
Mr. Gilman.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.962
His wife here?

14:21.995 --> 14:22.930
Not here yet.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.663
Maybe we should

14:23.696 --> 14:25.298
check on her.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.500
Make sure she survived
their sexual encounter.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.635
Dr. Weaver, your coat.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.670
You brushed against some blood.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.076
Get a pressure.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.146
Keep him on lido,
two migs per minute.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.014
PRATT:
Did he have any experience
cutting down trees?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.382
Are they fresh off
the boat or what?

14:42.415 --> 14:43.650
He's only been here
about two weeks

14:43.683 --> 14:45.218
but his uncle, Jose

14:45.252 --> 14:46.653
has been in the U.S.
for about three years.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.588
Is there any family
we can call for Jose?

14:48.621 --> 14:49.957
¿Donde esta
la familia de Jose?

14:49.957 --> 14:51.658
San Felipe, Nicaragua.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.226
We...

14:53.260 --> 14:55.162
You're illegal.
No problemo.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.329
Problema.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.165
Tell him anything
that he needs

14:58.198 --> 15:00.000
he can get done here, no charge.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.503
( Chuny speaking Spanish )

15:03.536 --> 15:05.138
Hi, Dr. Lewis again.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
Listen, I know you're
really backed up

15:07.274 --> 15:10.477
but I have a patient Dr. DeRaad
needs to see immediately.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.979
No, don't put me on hold.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.513
Hey, what are you doing?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.315
Jerry.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.549
Oh, that's my board.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.018
Anastasia, no.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.487
You've erased
all our patients.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.655
Can I write on the board, too?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.524
Timmy,
sit back down.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.359
Why did you do this?

15:26.393 --> 15:28.528
Ergo, God.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.030
Ergo, Ritalin.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.531
Your blood test says
you're on Ritalin.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.501
You took it
for the math competition?

15:34.534 --> 15:37.204
These numbers, discovered
in different cultures

15:37.237 --> 15:39.506
in different centuries,
all add to zero.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.574
Proving the universe
is perfect.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.610
Proving the existence

15:43.643 --> 15:45.712
of God.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.481
Hey, I can't even prove
I paid my gas bill.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.351
Jerry, just... get the charts
and put all the names back up.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.086
Make her do it.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.522
Alphabetical,
geographical
or chronological?

15:55.555 --> 15:56.689
Alphabetical's good.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.259
Hey, do we have
any wound care sheets?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.393
So, you buying me
lunch today?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.461
No.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.595
Hey, it's
your turn.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.663
Dr. Pratt?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.232
What does appy
stand for?

16:05.265 --> 16:06.266
Appendicitis.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.767
Is now a good time?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.236
Sure.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.373
Where'd you find the gun?

16:13.406 --> 16:14.541
Like I told them...

16:14.574 --> 16:15.642
...but he's unstable.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.410
I'll walk him up myself.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.512
Don't hang...

16:19.546 --> 16:21.514
Chip...

16:21.548 --> 16:22.549
Where'd he go?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.084
Who? Your weeper?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.718
He was just here a minute ago.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.055
Oh, damn it.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.560
( door opening )

17:08.595 --> 17:11.231
Uh, excuse me.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.173
I need the SonoSite.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.542
I can't find
the heartbeat.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.578
Here, let me try.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.579
How many weeks?

17:27.614 --> 17:31.151
Fourteen.
I think it...

17:35.688 --> 17:37.657
Try a different angle.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.360
I'm sorry.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.728
Try again.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.137
LOCKHART:
It's not there.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.506
Are you bleeding?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.477
Are you bleeding?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.580
A little.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.316
I thought I was just spotting.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.185
Do you want me to call your OB?

18:09.256 --> 18:12.659
No, I think it's better
if it happens naturally.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.700
Can you get me some scrubs?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.569
Dr. Weaver, you should go home.

18:22.602 --> 18:27.574
Just, um, bring me some scrubs
when you get a chance.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.192
Hello, um, they brought
my husband in.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.326
Daniel Gilman.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.228
( clipboard fumbling )

18:48.261 --> 18:50.763
Uh, um... yeah,
the 93-year-old?

18:50.797 --> 18:51.798
Is he all right?

18:51.831 --> 18:53.666
I'll take you
to him.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.901
Thank you.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.210
You guys are pathetic.

19:03.210 --> 19:03.843
What?
What?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.345
You stare any harder

19:05.378 --> 19:07.314
her ass is going
to burst into flames.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.715
I'd put that fire out.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.849
Stop, drop and roll.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.819
He has a dilated
cardiomyopathy.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.388
We're going to treat it
very aggressively

19:15.422 --> 19:17.224
but the prognosis
is not good.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.392
He could have a fatal
arrhythmia at any time.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.794
Oh, Danny.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.330
( speaking softly )

19:27.534 --> 19:28.535
Excuse me?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.937
When can I bang her?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.339
What did he say?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.876
Uh, he wants to know
when he might be able to...

19:36.909 --> 19:38.278
( clearing throat )

19:38.311 --> 19:39.379
...have sex.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.617
We're trying to have a baby.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.754
Uh-huh...

19:49.722 --> 19:52.725
Uh, when you can walk up
two flights of stairs

19:52.759 --> 19:54.461
without
getting winded...

19:56.829 --> 19:59.266
...go for it.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.834
Okay?

20:04.637 --> 20:05.605
( knocking at door )

20:05.638 --> 20:06.739
NURSE:
Dr. Weaver?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.007
Yeah?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.910
Uh, Security needs
to talk to you.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.746
I'll be right there.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.373
Wow.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.342
Hey, that's great.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.644
It's my own variation
of Buckminster Fuller's

20:44.677 --> 20:46.045
geodesic dome design.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.582
Anastasia, I told you
to wait in your chair.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.750
Sorry.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.684
No, it's no problem.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.920
This is, this is very cool.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.289
Oh, um, they took Jose
up to radiology

20:56.323 --> 20:57.857
to embolize
the pelvic bleeders.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.692
Bueno.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.963
What are you doing?

21:09.336 --> 21:11.471
Hi. Just getting
a cup of coffee.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.639
Well, while you
were in here

21:12.672 --> 21:14.341
playing with
your Lincoln logs

21:14.374 --> 21:15.675
Security called me
about Pratt

21:15.708 --> 21:17.377
smuggling
a loaded weapon...

21:17.410 --> 21:19.045
Yeah, that was
a misunderstanding.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.047
It's an automatic
suspension.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.782
He found the gun
in the bushes.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.584
I was there
when he turned it in.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.652
You know what,
the interns are

21:25.685 --> 21:26.686
your responsibility,
Carter.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.720
All right,
I know, I know.

21:27.754 --> 21:28.888
I'm taking care of it.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.657
It's, um, it's taken care of.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.624
PRATT:
Hey, hey!

21:31.658 --> 21:32.592
What are you doing?!

21:32.625 --> 21:33.626
Move!

21:33.660 --> 21:34.727
You can't just leave him.

21:34.761 --> 21:35.562
You didn't even pay him.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.596
Get out of my way.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.498
Lady, damn it, stop this car.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.367
What do you want from me?
I don't even know these men.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.368
Stop this car!

21:41.401 --> 21:42.835
Stop it!
Hey, Pratt!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.771
You see what I'm dealing with?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.839
Hey, hey!

21:46.873 --> 21:50.109
Stupid bitch!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.711
What the hell are you doing?

21:55.748 --> 21:56.583
What?

21:56.616 --> 21:57.817
What?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.519
Your patients know
where she lives.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.887
Just report her
to the police.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.954
Yeah, like they give a damn.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.391
Like you do?

22:04.391 --> 22:05.758
Look, you come in
constantly late

22:05.792 --> 22:07.427
you're leaving
whenever

22:07.460 --> 22:08.795
you feel like it, you're
hot-dogging patients

22:08.828 --> 22:10.397
you never follow orders
and now you're

22:10.430 --> 22:11.831
throwing rocks
and bringing guns to work.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.433
Hey, I explained about that gun.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.602
I've seen your type
before, Pratt.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.769
No, you haven't.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.638
You don't know anything
about me.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.773
I know what I see.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.575
Oh, yeah? What is that?

22:22.609 --> 22:27.914
Someone throwing
their career away.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.621
One, two, three.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.722
Oh.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.023
ID says Rosemary
Bell, 18.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.491
Why is she in restraints?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.692
She was flailing
and incoherent.

22:39.726 --> 22:40.960
Witness reported
she collapsed

22:40.993 --> 22:41.994
and cracked her head.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.663
LOC one minute.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.164
CBC, lytes, BUN and creatinine.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.666
Foley with dip and icon.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.834
Pulse 122,
BP's 86 systolic.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.502
She looks kind of familiar.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.871
I think maybe Dr. Lewis has
treated her before.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.440
Airway intact.
Normocephalic.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.574
Rosemary

22:54.607 --> 22:55.908
follow the light.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.109
Sats 98.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.512
Rosemary, can
you understand me?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.450
She's deaf.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.517
Remove the restraints.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.718
Do you want me
to go get Dr. Lewis?

23:05.752 --> 23:06.953
Dr. Weaver?

23:06.986 --> 23:08.621
No, thanks, Abby.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.857
I've got this.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.026
Um, where
does it hurt?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.795
Yeah, your head.
Wait, wait, wait.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.096
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.965
Your head, yes.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.567
And your back?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.901
Your... here?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.770
Your kidneys?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.672
Okay.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
Burns when you pee.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.809
What's her temperature?

23:29.842 --> 23:31.744
103.2.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.880
She passed out
because she's septic.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.815
Can you read lips?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.183
Good.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.986
We're going to take
care of you, okay?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.958
No. I don't want a lady doctor.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.093
Jim!

23:47.126 --> 23:48.495
Uh, it's nothing personal.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.696
I'm sure you're very competent.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.763
I'm just old-fashioned.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.500
Huh. We call
it sexist. Hmm.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.767
What about Junior here?

23:54.801 --> 23:56.102
Carter, would you
like to take care

23:56.135 --> 23:56.936
of Mr. McNulty?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.104
In a minute.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.506
Oh, forget it.
I'm out of here.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.707
No. Your leg's
bleeding.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.141
Let's take care
of that first, okay?

24:02.174 --> 24:03.242
You don't deserve

24:03.275 --> 24:04.511
to call yourselves
physicians.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.545
Let him go.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.679
Oh, Dr. McNulty,
wait.

24:06.713 --> 24:07.947
You people
should be ashamed.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.882
You've perfected
a medical system

24:09.916 --> 24:12.118
that breaks the spirit,
humiliates the body

24:12.151 --> 24:13.520
and enrages the mind.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.654
John!
Yeah, yeah.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.555
Hey.
Thank you.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.756
You're a doctor?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.525
I got a stethoscope
older than you.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.126
Some kids broke into
our clinic for drugs.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.861
I hid, but
Mr. Former
Marine decided

24:21.894 --> 24:22.929
to take them on.

24:22.962 --> 24:23.963
They're lucky

24:23.996 --> 24:25.197
my sciatica
was acting up

24:25.231 --> 24:26.833
or they'd both
be in traction.

24:26.866 --> 24:27.900
They hit him
on the head

24:27.934 --> 24:29.068
with a
baseball bat.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.070
Uh, more a bunt
than a full swing.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.939
He fell on broken glass
and was unconscious

24:32.972 --> 24:33.906
for several minutes.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.842
I was assessing my wounds.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.645
Okay, okay, then you may
be seriously hurt.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.880
Negative Romberg.

24:40.913 --> 24:41.981
No pronator drift.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.617
Blunt head trauma,
prolonged LOC.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.752
Ugh...

24:45.785 --> 24:47.119
You need a head CT.
For what?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.621
To rule out any brain injury.

24:48.655 --> 24:49.989
I just told you,
I don't have any.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.659
Well, then, what's it going
to hurt to check?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.794
Oh, please, Jim,
just get the CT.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.265
Ten bucks says it's negative.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.299
You're on.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.300
Abby, this is
Dr. McNulty

25:01.333 --> 25:03.035
formally of
Curtain Two.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.971
He needs a head
CT, CBC, chem
seven, urinalysis.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.839
Hey, I didn't
agree to all that.
Okay.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.108
And when's the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.309
October.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.911
1949.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.213
Okay, well, you might
need another one.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.815
I'll be with you
in a moment.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.750
Do you have to pee
in a cup?

25:17.784 --> 25:18.951
Yes, he does.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.887
Okay, start peeing,
count to three

25:20.920 --> 25:22.321
pee a little bit
in the cup.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.691
Put the lid on,
and then you're done.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.792
Then, wash my hands, right?

25:25.825 --> 25:26.959
You got it.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.227
I'll wait for
you right here.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.296
Okay.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.908
Did you dispo your tree trimmer
without my okay?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.175
I signed off to Chen.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.877
I was the physician of record.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.014
What's this?

25:48.047 --> 25:51.083
Drunk bumsicle with a head lac.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.753
I'm not throwing my career away.

25:53.786 --> 25:54.854
Uh-huh.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.823
Did you close the galea ?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.891
Yeah. It wasn't my gun.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.059
I was going to throw it
in the river

26:00.092 --> 26:01.327
after my shift ended.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.929
Why didn't you do it
on the way in?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.864
I was late.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.099
LEWIS:
Titrate five of MS
and get films on that ankle.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.801
Abby, can you give me a hand
with this?

26:08.835 --> 26:10.136
Sure, in a minute.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.771
You haven't seen my insomniac,
have you?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.706
He just went
in there.
Oh, thank God.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.874
Something wrong?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.108
No. I just thought he skipped.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.644
What are you doing out here?

26:17.644 --> 26:19.111
Waiting for a urine sample
from a kid.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.279
There's a kid in there?

26:20.312 --> 26:21.681
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.149
What? What's wrong?

26:23.182 --> 26:24.216
What's the matter?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.351
Chip. Chip Mealy?

26:25.384 --> 26:26.753
JIMMY:
Hey, I'm in here.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.054
Unlock the door.
What are you doing?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.288
Are you all right?

26:29.321 --> 26:30.823
Yeah. I got
some on my hand.

26:30.857 --> 26:31.958
That's okay.
Let me take it.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.159
Did anybody... ?

26:33.192 --> 26:34.927
Did you see anybody else
in here?

26:34.961 --> 26:35.928
No.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.864
Okay, go outside.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.999
Do you want me to call Security?

26:40.032 --> 26:42.101
No. Are you sure
he came in here?

26:42.134 --> 26:44.203
Chip?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.874
Chip?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.709
( crying )
Chip.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.782
Did you do anything to him?

26:55.815 --> 26:57.817
No.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.919
But I wanted to.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.288
( sobbing )

27:02.321 --> 27:03.823
( alarms sound )

27:03.856 --> 27:06.258
HALEH:
Pressure's
dropping.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.696
Dr. Weaver,
are you okay?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.330
She's down
at 80 systolic.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.032
Give her another liter.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.701
Amp and gent are
both finished.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.803
Okay.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.439
( sighs )

27:20.472 --> 27:22.842
You have a bladder infection
that's spread to your kidneys.

27:22.875 --> 27:23.910
Give her two grams

27:23.943 --> 27:25.311
of cefotaxime.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.080
If she doesn't perk up,
we'll add dopamine.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.917
Are you sexually active?

27:33.853 --> 27:35.722
Well, how many partners?

27:35.755 --> 27:37.924
And how long has it burned
when you pee?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.291
Two weeks.

27:39.325 --> 27:43.429
Why haven't you told anyone?

27:43.462 --> 27:46.899
Do you live with your parents?

27:46.933 --> 27:50.036
And you don't want them
to know that you're having sex?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.403
All right.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.839
Your parents don't need to know

27:52.872 --> 27:54.040
but we do need to tell...

27:54.073 --> 27:56.943
( pained sigh )

28:01.814 --> 28:05.251
We need to tell them
that you're sick.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.086
For

28:07.119 --> 28:08.921
at least six hours

28:08.955 --> 28:11.858
and if the antibiotics don't
work fast, it may be overnight.

28:11.891 --> 28:12.859
It's okay, it's okay.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.126
Haleh, take her to CT.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.962
This could be more

28:15.995 --> 28:17.329
than simple Pyelo.
You all right?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.298
Yeah. I'll talk to you
when you get back.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.939
Dr. Weaver, can you
look at a possible
erythema nodosum?

28:26.973 --> 28:27.907
Uh, get Carter.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.341
I think he's busy.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.410
Then find another attending.

28:33.345 --> 28:36.082
( sighs )

28:39.852 --> 28:40.820
What are you doing?

28:40.853 --> 28:42.021
What are you doing?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.222
You can't do that in here.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.423
Will you stop?

28:44.456 --> 28:45.925
Don't stop!

28:45.958 --> 28:48.060
Get off of him now.
No!

28:48.094 --> 28:50.162
For crying out loud,
he just had a heart attack.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.263
Oh, relax.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.899
He needs his
Viagra anyway.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.500
Not while he's on nitro.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.935
I want my Viagra!

28:55.968 --> 28:57.536
Only if you want to die
with an erection.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.538
Are you out
of your mind?

28:59.571 --> 29:01.440
He needs to
recuperate.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.175
I was just trying
to make him feel better.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.211
Look, Mrs. Gilman, he is
in critical condition.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.880
WOMAN:
What did you do to him?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.882
My father did not
give her power of attorney.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.818
Any procedures have
to be okayed by me.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.185
These are Mr. Gilman's kids.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.954
Bob, he is
really sick.

29:14.987 --> 29:15.922
I know.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.123
I know, honey.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.290
Are you treating him?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.325
I-I'm one of the...

29:19.358 --> 29:20.426
I want this slut of here now.

29:20.459 --> 29:21.427
DeRAAD:
I have a room full

29:21.460 --> 29:22.929
of patients and no beds.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.231
He'll have to get help
as an outpatient.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.966
What's wrong with
his forehead?

29:26.999 --> 29:28.434
He cut the word "evil"
into his skin

29:28.467 --> 29:30.336
to scare people away.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.039
It's not a suicide attempt,
and he hasn't hurt anyone.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.406
Fine. Let's toss
him your son.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.975
Abby.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.010
What? This guy needs
to be kept away from children.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.846
You can't rehabilitate
child molesters.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.280
He hasn't
molested anyone.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.849
He needs medication.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.918
He needs to be
in a regular program.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.187
I can't commit people
for thoughts.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.288
I can't.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.857
If this guy walks
out of here

29:50.890 --> 29:52.091
he's going to
attack a child.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.860
This is our chance
to intervene

29:53.893 --> 29:55.995
maybe save this
guy, protect his
future victims.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.897
He's clearly a
threat to others.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.932
He has to say it.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.368
If he articulates a plan,
I'll put him on a hold.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.569
He won't.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.037
He's too frightened.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.875
All right.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.077
I'll talk to him again.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.612
Their parents and the principal
will meet us at the school.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.413
Hmm. How far is Olney?

30:14.446 --> 30:15.982
Five hours.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.349
Uh, I think they'll
sleep all the way.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.985
( phone ringing )
Mathletes.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.386
Oh, I take it
you were never on the math team.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.854
Oh, no. I was
on a real team.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.455
I think we called
it, uh, football.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.557
You were a jock. Ooh.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.259
Better to be a jock
than a nerd.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.195
Are you insinuating
that I'm a nerd?

30:29.228 --> 30:30.963
Yeah, but you're
a really hot nerd.

30:30.997 --> 30:31.630
( laughs )

30:31.663 --> 30:32.865
Phone call, Pratt.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.266
All right.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.068
Where's Weaver?

30:36.102 --> 30:38.037
I need some help
with this old
guy's family.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.438
Koko and Captain Viagra.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.540
It's common knowledge
that the crazier the woman

30:41.573 --> 30:43.910
the better the sex,
so just keep your head down

30:43.943 --> 30:45.477
and try not to get stabbed
in the neck.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.013
( laughs )
Can you call Legal?

30:47.046 --> 30:48.580
I need some help down here now.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.049
Hello.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.217
Yeah. No, I can't come...

30:51.250 --> 30:53.085
Wait. Just wait right there,
all right?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.887
Just calm down, okay?
I'm on my way.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.122
You just stay right there.
Jerry.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.523
Hey, everything
all right?

30:57.556 --> 30:58.390
No, I have to leave.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.425
Cover for me.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.893
Wait. What?
Not again.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.594
For how long? Pratt!

31:08.667 --> 31:11.537
( pained sigh )

31:14.473 --> 31:15.507
Hi.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.009
( sighs )

31:17.043 --> 31:18.310
How long have you been cramping?

31:18.344 --> 31:19.511
About an hour.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.280
How much bleeding?

31:21.313 --> 31:22.581
( sighs )

31:22.614 --> 31:24.550
Four pads.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.018
Okay, we need
to get you upstairs.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.319
Do you want me
to call Sandy?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.521
She's at work.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.557
She'd want to be with you.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.059
I can't.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.961
I don't want
to check in upstairs.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.029
I-I don't... want it
all over the hospital.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.965
I think you need a D&C
right away.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.000
No. No, just...

31:41.033 --> 31:44.003
page me if the OB
resident comes down

31:44.036 --> 31:45.972
for another consult.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.976
I'm calling Maynard.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.280
Hey, have
you seen Kerry?

31:54.313 --> 31:56.082
Yeah. She's on a break.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.283
Where?
What do you need?

31:57.316 --> 31:58.317
I need Kerry.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.185
Hey, what are you... ?

31:59.218 --> 32:00.219
What are you doing?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.387
You can't suture yourself.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.721
I have patients
waiting for me

32:02.754 --> 32:04.023
back at my clinic.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.291
Where did you get
these supplies?

32:05.324 --> 32:06.625
The nurse set
them out for you.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.995
45 minutes ago.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.397
Nice eversion.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.999
Still, can't let you do it.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.366
GALLANT:
Hey, Dr. Carter.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.534
I can't find Dr. Weaver

32:15.567 --> 32:17.236
and Mrs. Gilman has
a special request.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.705
My attorney's
on her way over
here right now.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.273
Mattie, he wants to do it.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.674
So do I.
What?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.610
GALLANT:
Koko wants to
collect semen

32:24.643 --> 32:27.546
from her husband who is 93
and just had an MI.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.715
Oh, he was trying
to give me a baby.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.218
Please don't debase my father
any further.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.352
He's senile.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.021
He is not senile.
He's horny.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.656
GALLANT:
Uh, Mr. Gilman

32:37.689 --> 32:39.158
has agreed to, uh...

32:39.191 --> 32:40.559
( clears throat )

32:40.592 --> 32:42.694
electroejactulation.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.230
Come again?

32:44.263 --> 32:46.032
I'm an electroejaculation
technician.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.036
Your parents must be very proud.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.039
I have to ejaculate him
before he dies.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.440
Otherwise, I have
to do a seminal vesicle harvest.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.042
It's much more
complicated.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.676
We want to make sure
that he doesn't die.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.211
KOKO:
Well, we can
still get it now.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.779
Oh, it was always
about the money

33:00.812 --> 33:03.749
wasn't it, Koko?

33:03.782 --> 33:05.551
If she doesn't
get pregnant
before he dies

33:05.584 --> 33:06.718
she doesn't inherit anything.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.420
Inherit?
Seven million, roughly.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.222
My husband signed a release.

33:10.256 --> 33:11.157
I know my rights.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.624
I want his semen.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.362
Okay, well, what exactly is it
that's, um, involved?

33:16.395 --> 33:17.663
A rectal probe
is inserted

33:17.696 --> 33:18.797
which causes contraction

33:18.830 --> 33:20.366
of the vas deferens
seminal vesicle

33:20.399 --> 33:22.068
and the prostate.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.670
Called a
"reflex
ejaculation."

33:27.639 --> 33:29.775
Okay, good.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.677
Excuse me.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.280
( clears throat )

33:34.313 --> 33:35.514
Did you call Legal?

33:35.547 --> 33:36.615
Oh, they're, uh...

33:36.648 --> 33:37.716
They're sending
somebody.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.817
CHEN:
Carter!

33:38.850 --> 33:40.752
Three-story fall
through skylight.

33:40.786 --> 33:41.720
Good luck, Gallant.

33:41.753 --> 33:42.788
How should I handle this?

33:42.821 --> 33:44.323
Gently.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.591
Full trauma panel,
Foley and NG.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.093
He's going
to need a central line.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.594
Decreased breath
sounds on both sides.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.362
Bilateral chest tubes.
Squeeze in
two of O-neg.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.330
Type and cross
for four.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.598
He's got a dozen

33:52.631 --> 33:54.266
deep lacerations.
Bunch of pumpers.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.401
We're going to have
to clamp off

33:55.434 --> 33:56.802
or he's going to keep leaking.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.470
We need another doctor in here.
Where's Weaver?

33:58.504 --> 33:59.705
I don't know.
Romano sent Kovac home.

33:59.738 --> 34:00.706
Pressure's dropping.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.774
Sats down to 82.

34:02.808 --> 34:03.742
Okay, get Pratt.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.810
CHEN:
He left.

34:04.843 --> 34:05.844
What?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.713
He had an emergency again.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.714
( laughs )

34:08.746 --> 34:10.116
( alarms )

34:10.116 --> 34:11.550
( crying )

34:11.583 --> 34:13.685
Leon! Where are you, man?
What... ?

34:13.719 --> 34:15.821
( crying )

34:20.426 --> 34:21.726
What happened to you?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.129
Did you pass out, huh?

34:23.161 --> 34:24.230
No, they kicked me.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.231
They stabbed me.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.764
They stomped
on my hand.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.266
Did you pass out, huh?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.435
I'm dying, G.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.869
Who did this to you?
Dukey and them?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.838
Yeah.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.406
They wanted
the gun.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.141
They wanted
to kill me.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.509
Shh. Okay, come on,
you have to be quiet.

34:37.543 --> 34:38.810
I have to listen, all right?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.480
They wanted it, and
I didn't have it.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.581
And I got scared.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.849
And they got
so mad at me.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.451
Okay, okay.
It was Dukey's gun, right?

34:45.484 --> 34:46.552
And they stabbed you?

34:46.585 --> 34:47.553
Where did they stab you, huh?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.719
In the ass.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.821
In the ass, G.
They stabbed me.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.190
All right, come on, come on.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.391
We got to go to the hospital.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.759
Come on, get up.
No, no, no, no.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.693
Where's the gun, G?

34:54.726 --> 34:55.860
Don't worry about it.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.429
Come on. We have to go
to the hospital.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.265
Oh, they're going
to kill both of us.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.899
Nobody's going to kill us, Leon.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.169
They're going to
kill both of us.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.470
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.542
Where are we?

35:10.576 --> 35:13.645
Don't even bother
gloving up.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.781
Time of death, 1844.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.550
Sorry. I came as
soon as I heard.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.553
It's not your fault.

35:21.587 --> 35:24.523
Carter, labs
on your cranky old doctor.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.258
McNulty? Thank you.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.326
But he's M.I.A.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.227
He's diabetic.

35:28.260 --> 35:28.927
Get him on the phone.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.562
He needs to come back.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.431
He probably doesn't
even know he's sick.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.266
I tried, but I keep
getting a machine.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.834
Well, tell him
his blood sugar's 435

35:35.867 --> 35:37.469
and get him back here
immediately.

35:37.503 --> 35:38.770
And page Dr. Pratt-- 911.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.639
I'm going to have
you on the I.V.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.408
for about
another half hour.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.446
Everything's fine.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.883
Kerry, you should
really think about...

35:51.917 --> 35:54.720
Pelvic rest, return
with abdominal pain

35:54.753 --> 35:56.722
fever or
increased bleeding.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.626
Methedrine point two milligrams
p.o. Q.I.D.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.428
I know what to do.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.831
I was going to say
you should take some time off.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.467
Come see me in three days.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.475
Can I get you anything?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.744
Mm-mmm.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.447
Do you want me to try
and call Sandy at work?

36:26.318 --> 36:28.554
Abby?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.829
I can give you a ride home
in about an hour.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.899
Thanks.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.010
We were lucky
to capture

36:52.043 --> 36:53.779
that retrograde ejaculation
as well.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.014
Lucky. We're moving
your husband to C.C.U.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.649
Oh, Mattie and Bob are with him.

36:57.683 --> 36:58.817
I have to go.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.619
I ovulated this morning.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.489
Let's go,
we're killing spermatozoa.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.624
Did he just say "spermatozoa"?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.693
That man has an
electroejaculator.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.361
Electroejaculator?

37:09.395 --> 37:10.996
Does that come with a costume?

37:11.029 --> 37:12.598
Nope, an extension cord.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.533
Oh, the mighty Gilman
pulled through.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.435
An inspiration to us all.

37:16.468 --> 37:17.936
Gallant, Pratt for you.

37:17.969 --> 37:21.307
Abby, have you ever heard
of an electroejaculator?

37:21.340 --> 37:22.508
You just like saying that word.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.543
No. I had
an instant ejaculator once.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.312
Tommy Reynolds--
tenth grade.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.614
Poor kid never could
make it out of his jeans.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.915
Ixnay on the
jaculator-ay.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.383
Hey, has anybody seen Pratt?

37:31.417 --> 37:32.984
Uh, Gallant's
on the phone with him.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.354
No, look, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.555
I want to talk to him.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.324
Dr. Carter
wants to talk to you.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.491
Where the hell are you?

37:39.525 --> 37:41.360
Pratt...?

37:41.393 --> 37:42.594
What's going
on, Gallant?

37:42.628 --> 37:43.929
I'm only going
to ask you once.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.464
( agonized yelling )

37:45.497 --> 37:46.732
( pounding on door )

37:46.765 --> 37:48.400
Lay on your stomach.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.735
Lay on your stomach.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.437
It hurts
all over, G!

37:51.470 --> 37:52.971
Gallant,
what took you so damn long?

37:53.004 --> 37:55.006
I can see
I clearly got through to you

37:55.040 --> 37:56.575
earlier today.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.511
Running a little clinic
out of the apartment?

37:59.545 --> 38:00.779
Come on, man.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.481
Who's hurt?

38:05.551 --> 38:07.553
It's my brother, Leon.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.355
LEON:
Who are you?

38:10.622 --> 38:11.923
G...?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.625
Don't worry;
he's a doctor, too.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.827
He looks like
he should be
in the hospital.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.963
LEON ( sobbing ):
Not me; I hurt there.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.097
Calm down, calm down.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.599
We're not going anywhere.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.000
Just calm down.
( groaning )

38:22.033 --> 38:23.935
Listen, we're staying
right here.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.638
Either you're going
to help or you're not.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.640
This is... not smart, Pratt.

38:28.674 --> 38:29.875
Everything
in my life

38:29.908 --> 38:31.877
is not smart, Carter.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.547
How long ago did you get hurt?

38:35.581 --> 38:38.016
PRATT:
Three hours ago,
but he's okay.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.852
Gunshot?

38:40.886 --> 38:42.988
Stab wound.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.123
Also fractured
fourth and fifth metacarpals.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.625
He's got broken ribs

38:46.658 --> 38:48.960
a bloody nose, but
no septal hematoma.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.463
Listen to me.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.564
Um... I'm good.

38:52.598 --> 38:53.599
I got this.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.633
I mean, you can go now.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.535
All I needed
was a suture kit.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.139
Why don't you want
to go to the hospital?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.874
You don't want
the assault reported?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.109
They going to kill us.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.144
PRATT:
Nobody's going
to kill us.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.012
Let it go.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.814
Why did you get beat up?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.983
I didn't have the gun
when they asked for it.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.652
We got to get it back, G.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.953
They want it!

39:14.986 --> 39:17.656
Holding the gun for
someone else, huh?

39:17.689 --> 39:18.824
My friends.

39:19.791 --> 39:20.659
( yelling )

39:20.692 --> 39:23.061
Some friends.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.564
( Leon groaning )

39:25.597 --> 39:28.500
I'm a danger
to myself and others.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.569
If you went home,
what would you do?

39:35.040 --> 39:37.476
I don't know.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.582
Chip, you have to tell him
exactly what you would do.

39:43.615 --> 39:44.683
Stop coaching him.

39:44.716 --> 39:45.717
Where
are you going?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.752
I have patients.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.019
Chip, listen to me
right now.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.855
If you don't
tell the truth

39:49.888 --> 39:51.122
we can't help you.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.459
This is your last chance.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.501
I'm picking up my ex-
girlfriend's son from school...

40:06.705 --> 40:10.942
and having sex with him
in my car

40:10.976 --> 40:17.749
behind the baseball field...
as soon as I leave here.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.485
( sobbing )

40:19.518 --> 40:22.721
Okay, I'll make room for him.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.525
( crying )

40:35.000 --> 40:36.902
How are you feeling?

40:36.935 --> 40:41.740
Good. Did you call your parents?

40:41.773 --> 40:43.642
They're going
to worry about you.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.479
What did she say?

40:47.513 --> 40:49.581
Uh, "They'll worry about me more

40:49.615 --> 40:51.750
if they know
I have a boyfriend."

40:55.554 --> 40:57.656
What?

40:57.689 --> 40:59.758
She doesn't want
to disappoint them

40:59.791 --> 41:02.528
more than she already has
by being deaf.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.532
No, you can't go home.

41:06.565 --> 41:07.866
You have to stay here

41:07.899 --> 41:11.202
tonight.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.605
No calls.

41:16.174 --> 41:19.545
Why was I a patient?

41:19.545 --> 41:20.579
You saw me.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.253
( sighing )

41:28.286 --> 41:30.556
I was...

41:56.247 --> 41:59.685
( soft, stifled sobs )

41:59.718 --> 42:03.154
( anguished sobbing )

42:07.626 --> 42:08.760
Leon, he's your brother?

42:08.794 --> 42:10.696
No.

42:10.729 --> 42:13.031
Well, yeah... kind of.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.601
He came to live
with me and my mom

42:15.601 --> 42:16.868
when he was nine.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.604
I was six then.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.271
I idolized him.

42:20.305 --> 42:25.677
Then when I was 15, my
mom died of liver cancer

42:25.711 --> 42:27.779
and Leon took
care of me.

42:27.813 --> 42:30.348
Made sure I
went to school.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.083
So, when I was in college

42:32.117 --> 42:35.687
one day he got into a fight
in a bar in Detroit.

42:35.721 --> 42:39.057
Believe me, this is
one tough son of a bitch.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.292
I'm trying to tell you,
I mean, he survived

42:41.326 --> 42:43.261
a nine-millimeter bullet
to the brain.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.664
But in turn

42:45.697 --> 42:50.235
his I.Q. dropped
about 40 points.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.376
Do you have any help?

42:58.409 --> 43:02.914
No. I've been doing it
on my own for years.

43:02.948 --> 43:05.684
I'm good at that.

43:09.755 --> 43:12.791
Well, we work as a team.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.693
We cover for each other.

43:14.726 --> 43:17.729
We lean
on each other.

43:17.763 --> 43:21.867
The job's too big
to do solo.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.936
But if you can't get that...

43:24.970 --> 43:28.239
maybe you should be a surgeon.

43:28.273 --> 43:31.309
Or a superhero,
or something else

43:31.342 --> 43:34.813
that doesn't require
trusting people.

43:34.846 --> 43:40.786
I've never been big on trust.

43:40.819 --> 43:43.755
You know what that turns into?

43:43.789 --> 43:48.259
Nobody trusts you either.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.196
Look, self-sufficiency
is a good thing

43:51.229 --> 43:53.331
but it's not
the only thing.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.702
Asking for help
when you need it...

43:56.702 --> 44:02.440
that doesn't make you weak.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.811
Um, maybe
I should go inside now.

44:07.946 --> 44:11.282
All right.
