00:12.324 --> 00:14.541
Morning, Pop.
You're up early.

00:14.543 --> 00:16.743
Uh, couldn't sleep.

00:16.745 --> 00:19.412
You've been up since 3:30.

00:19.414 --> 00:21.080
I heard you banging around.

00:21.082 --> 00:23.115
Well... mayor's coming in.

00:23.117 --> 00:25.251
He's on my case
about the budget.

00:32.977 --> 00:36.129
You've been thinking about Joe.

00:36.964 --> 00:39.732
I always think about Joe.

00:39.734 --> 00:42.268
It's coming up on two years.

00:43.871 --> 00:46.506
Our kids are supposed
to bury <i>us.</i>

00:47.675 --> 00:51.177
I know I didn't personally
order that warrant enforced,

00:51.179 --> 00:52.979
but I was his commissioner.

00:52.981 --> 00:57.083
And sometimes
at night, alone...

00:57.085 --> 01:01.287
I find myself left
with an inescapable truth:

01:01.289 --> 01:04.824
my son was killed on my watch.

01:04.825 --> 01:06.626
Francis, you can't think like...

01:08.630 --> 01:10.663
What's up?

01:12.399 --> 01:15.001
Hello?
What?

01:17.805 --> 01:19.939
All right, I'll tell him.

01:19.941 --> 01:21.641
When did this call come in?

01:21.643 --> 01:23.343
Tell my detail

01:23.345 --> 01:25.979
I'm going to want to stop there
on the way in.

01:27.782 --> 01:29.382
That was Danny.

01:34.723 --> 01:36.656
As you were.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.561
Frank, is it true
about the Clearys?

01:41.563 --> 01:42.996
We'll let you
know, Barbara.

01:42.998 --> 01:44.130
Please stand back.

01:44.132 --> 01:46.032
Pop.

01:46.034 --> 01:48.200
I understand.

01:48.202 --> 01:50.003
You go ahead, Francis.

01:50.005 --> 01:52.405
Commissioner. Sir.

02:05.218 --> 02:07.487
Danny.

02:07.489 --> 02:09.521
I was on my way
into work.

02:09.524 --> 02:11.557
Had to ask twice when
they said the address.

02:11.559 --> 02:12.792
Wouldn't sink in.

02:12.794 --> 02:16.562
Different if it's someone you know.
Yeah.

02:16.564 --> 02:18.531
Chief of D's thought
you'd have the advantage,

02:18.533 --> 02:21.167
this being your home turf. Okay.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.637
Him first, then her.

02:24.639 --> 02:27.457
Yeah. Maid came in
this morning to work

02:27.459 --> 02:28.708
and found them like this.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.377
She ran across the street.
Fitzgeralds called 911.

02:31.379 --> 02:33.446
Forced entry? Robbery?
Doesn't look like it.

02:33.448 --> 02:35.264
M.E. puts it sometime
last night.

02:35.266 --> 02:38.384
He's asleep in front of
the TV, she comes down...

02:38.386 --> 02:39.986
Killing was done quick.

02:39.988 --> 02:43.256
Eunice... has defensive wounds.

02:43.258 --> 02:45.291
I got to tell you,

02:45.293 --> 02:47.226
I don't want to think
what I'm thinking, Dad.

02:50.263 --> 02:52.965
Sir? The daughter just arrived.

02:55.703 --> 02:57.954
Easy, easy. Annie.

02:57.956 --> 02:59.539
You can't go in there.
Nobody can. Please...

02:59.541 --> 03:01.340
Please. Danny,

03:01.342 --> 03:02.742
Mr. Reagan,
what's going on?

03:02.744 --> 03:05.044
Mrs. Fitzgerald said something
happened to Mom and Dad.

03:05.046 --> 03:07.947
I'm sorry, Annie.
What do you mean?

03:07.949 --> 03:09.449
What are you talking about?

03:09.451 --> 03:11.284
Ann!
Al.

03:11.286 --> 03:12.502
What's happening?
What's going on?

03:12.504 --> 03:13.503
It's Mom and Dad.
What? Are they all right?

03:13.505 --> 03:15.521
Are they inside?

03:15.523 --> 03:16.522
You can't go inside, Al.

03:16.524 --> 03:18.324
It's a crime scene.

03:18.326 --> 03:19.392
Crime scene?

03:19.394 --> 03:21.127
Please, Mr.
Reagan, just tell me.

03:21.129 --> 03:22.895
Danny...

03:23.964 --> 03:26.299
They were attacked last night
and found this morning.

03:26.301 --> 03:27.900
That's all we can say.

03:35.993 --> 03:37.443
What happened?

03:37.445 --> 03:38.811
We can't say.

03:38.813 --> 03:41.047
Danny... please.

03:41.049 --> 03:42.532
This is <i>me.</i>

03:44.718 --> 03:46.552
He'd say that to anyone, Al.

03:46.554 --> 03:49.005
It's an ongoing investigation.

03:51.158 --> 03:52.525
Where's our brother?

03:52.527 --> 03:53.860
Where's Ronnie?

03:55.263 --> 03:57.296
He's not here.

04:30.850 --> 04:33.575
Danny, I knew something
was going to happen.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.791
Ever since they let
Ronnie move back in.

04:36.793 --> 04:38.643
We can't jump
to conclusions, Al.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.029
If it's not true, Ann,
where is he?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.264
Listen, we called the
warehouse where Ronnie works.

04:43.266 --> 04:45.233
He didn't show up for
work this morning.

04:45.235 --> 04:46.401
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

04:46.403 --> 04:48.937
A friend's house, a girlfriend?
Friends?

04:48.939 --> 04:52.040
Danny... this is Ronnie
we're talking about.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.959
What friends
he hasn't stolen from,

04:54.961 --> 04:57.045
he cut off years ago.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.381
The only friend who stood
by him was his sponsor.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.150
I only know his first
name, but, uh,

05:02.152 --> 05:03.251
Ronnie was going to meetings

05:03.253 --> 05:05.353
down at the Methodist Church,
on Grove.

05:05.355 --> 05:07.689
Do you know when the last time
you saw your parents,

05:07.691 --> 05:08.957
or spoke to them last?

05:08.959 --> 05:10.291
Yesterday.

05:10.293 --> 05:13.594
I stopped by on my way home
from work.

05:13.596 --> 05:17.465
I talk to my mom every day.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.967
She seemed fine.

05:18.969 --> 05:22.904
Dad left the dealership
same as always, around 6:00.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.772
And where were you
last night, Al?

05:24.774 --> 05:26.274
What?

05:26.276 --> 05:29.143
Come on, Al. I got to ask
the questions, all right?

05:29.145 --> 05:32.747
Yeah, uh... I was home.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.449
You were with Sharon
and the kids?

05:34.451 --> 05:37.085
They're in Florida.
Her father's sick.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.120
Okay, and where were you
last night, Ann?

05:39.122 --> 05:40.688
I was home.
Can anybody

05:40.690 --> 05:42.006
verify that for you?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.591
Um, the doorman.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.625
What happens now?

05:44.627 --> 05:47.362
I mean, when do we get
to see them?

05:47.364 --> 05:48.930
I have to see them, Danny.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.765
One of you are going to have
to come down to the morgue

05:50.767 --> 05:52.333
and identify the bodies.

05:52.335 --> 05:54.435
I can't believe this.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.437
This can't be happening.
I hope

05:56.439 --> 05:59.741
that you find my brother
before I do.

05:59.743 --> 06:01.876
Me, too.

06:03.729 --> 06:05.730
<i>You want to bring me</i>
<i>up to speed?</i>

06:05.732 --> 06:07.782
Yeah. Take a look
for yourself.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.284
All right. So...

06:11.587 --> 06:13.821
So... it's a lot harder when
you know the people, huh?

06:13.823 --> 06:15.707
Yeah, that's what
my old man always said.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.625
Got a canine
unit out looking

06:17.627 --> 06:18.793
for the murder weapon.
There's a, uh,

06:18.795 --> 06:20.861
empty slot in the
kitchen knife rack

06:20.863 --> 06:22.463
that's consistent with the
size of the stab wounds.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.499
Pretty distinct footprints
through the blood, here.

06:24.501 --> 06:26.567
Yep. Made by a one person.

06:26.569 --> 06:28.386
Hey, Jackie.
Hey.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.771
Just talked to Dad.

06:29.773 --> 06:31.205
You really think
Ronnie did this?

06:31.207 --> 06:33.341
Well, he's definitely
a person of interest.

06:33.343 --> 06:34.842
Have a seat.

06:34.844 --> 06:36.010
We're looking at anybody

06:36.012 --> 06:37.779
who had motive
or access to the house,

06:37.781 --> 06:39.347
which would be the maid,
relatives,

06:39.349 --> 06:40.515
Mr. Cleary's employees.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.250
But I got to tell you,
Mrs. Fitzgerald

06:42.252 --> 06:43.484
does put Ronnie
at the house last night.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.019
She said she saw him when she
was walking the dog

06:45.021 --> 06:46.154
and he was coming home.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.989
There's always been trouble
there, but this?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.657
What kind of trouble?
Mr. Cleary

06:49.659 --> 06:51.058
rode those kids
something terrible.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.860
Mostly the boys,
and mostly Ronnie.

06:52.862 --> 06:55.229
Al ended up working for him
at the car dealership.

06:55.231 --> 06:57.115
Yeah, but Al was always
more resilient.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.900
Ronnie's... sensitive.

06:58.902 --> 07:00.952
Mr. Cleary called Ronnie
"cellar boy."

07:00.954 --> 07:02.703
I mean,
he thought it was funny.

07:02.705 --> 07:04.238
Ronnie used to cringe at that.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.040
What's "cellar boy"?

07:06.042 --> 07:08.276
He moved into the basement
when he was 14.

07:08.278 --> 07:09.677
I don't know
what came first,

07:09.679 --> 07:11.412
him moving down to the basement
or did he move down

07:11.414 --> 07:13.614
to the basement
to drink and smoke pot.

07:13.616 --> 07:14.782
Where's the mother
in all of this?

07:14.784 --> 07:16.818
Rose-colored glasses, I guess.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.653
Yep, they had
some knock-down-drag-outs

07:18.655 --> 07:20.254
over there, let me tell you.

07:20.256 --> 07:21.622
And they just had one
last year--

07:21.624 --> 07:24.058
a... a sector car
responded to a 52.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.461
Ronnie and Mr. Cleary
going at it again.

07:26.463 --> 07:27.695
35-year-old living at home?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.764
What's that all about?
You name it.

07:29.766 --> 07:31.899
Bipolar, using.
He'd move out,

07:31.901 --> 07:34.035
switch states, switch
jobs, get in trouble,

07:34.037 --> 07:36.103
move back in, get cleaned up.

07:36.105 --> 07:37.605
Some clean up.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.040
You have any idea where he is?
No.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.842
We've got a FINEST message
out on his car,

07:40.844 --> 07:42.243
and his AA sponsor said
if he hears from Ronnie,

07:42.245 --> 07:43.411
he'll give us a call.

07:43.413 --> 07:45.446
Poor Ronnie.

07:45.448 --> 07:47.081
Poor Ronnie?

07:47.083 --> 07:49.383
Take a look at these photos--
poor Ronnie.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.136
Mr. and Mrs. Cleary
at the crime scene.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.655
Nice, huh?

08:00.562 --> 08:03.431
Reagan. Hey!

08:03.433 --> 08:05.600
Quite the early bird.

08:05.602 --> 08:08.269
Uh, Sergeant Renzulli's good
work ethic is wearing off on me.

08:08.271 --> 08:10.655
Ah, your brother Joe's car.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.275
And now it's yours.

08:14.277 --> 08:16.694
What brings you down here,
Detective Malevsky?

08:16.696 --> 08:18.679
Why do you ask?

08:18.681 --> 08:21.165
No reason.
"No reason."

08:21.167 --> 08:24.485
There's an answer
for the ages.

08:24.487 --> 08:27.054
Be safe.

08:39.384 --> 08:42.836
Hey, Sergeant.
Beach boy.

08:42.837 --> 08:46.440
What, do you got a tan
or something? Huh?

08:46.442 --> 08:47.975
It's 55 degrees and you're,
uh, laying out?

08:47.977 --> 08:49.277
Might be how you spent

08:49.279 --> 08:50.678
your day off,
Sarge, but...

08:50.680 --> 08:52.380
I was working
on my car.

08:52.382 --> 08:53.381
The Chevelle?

08:53.383 --> 08:55.149
Yeah.
Ooh...

08:55.151 --> 08:56.517
Don't make me drool.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.590
Where's my gun?

09:02.592 --> 09:04.041
Huh?
My service weapon.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.993
I always keep it here
on the top shelf.

09:05.995 --> 09:07.094
It's gone.

09:07.096 --> 09:08.563
You sure you didn't
take it home?

09:08.565 --> 09:10.164
I can't tell you how many times...
No, I'm sure.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.532
I-I never take
my service weapon home.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.668
I swap it out
with my off-duty...

09:13.670 --> 09:15.970
after every tour.
Probably a prank

09:15.972 --> 09:17.889
one of the other guys in the
precinct's pulling on you.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.575
You tick anybody off?
Besides me, of course.

09:20.577 --> 09:22.393
No.
Only thing is...

09:22.395 --> 09:24.812
I wouldn't steal your gun,
I would steal your car.

09:29.017 --> 09:31.018
Listen to me.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.753
Hey! Take everything

09:32.755 --> 09:35.356
out of the locker
and go through the bag again.

09:35.358 --> 09:36.741
Then go back home and go over
every square inch of it

09:36.743 --> 09:39.410
for that weapon before you
report it to the C.O.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.329
All right.
'Cause then it becomes official

09:41.331 --> 09:44.031
and you're back under
IA investigation.

09:44.033 --> 09:47.401
IA? Again?
Oh, yeah.

09:47.403 --> 09:50.137
Losing your gun:
that is not nothing, kid.

09:50.139 --> 09:52.906
Sarge, I just saw
Sonny Malevsky out front.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.241
Was he... was he back here?

09:54.243 --> 09:55.643
In here? No.

09:55.645 --> 09:57.712
He was... at the front desk

09:57.714 --> 09:59.413
schmoozing with the guys
when I came in.

09:59.415 --> 10:00.615
Why?

10:00.617 --> 10:01.682
No reason. But didn't you say

10:01.684 --> 10:03.184
you could get past
these locks with a...

10:03.186 --> 10:05.620
a pair of scissors,
a pencil and a soda can?

10:05.622 --> 10:08.189
You think he stole your gun?

10:09.658 --> 10:11.492
No, I...

10:12.444 --> 10:15.229
Never mind. I, uh...

10:15.231 --> 10:17.448
I don't know why I said that.

10:27.108 --> 10:28.843
The mayor, sir.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.145
I asked you to cut
ten percent from your budget.

10:31.147 --> 10:32.780
You missed by a mile.

10:32.782 --> 10:35.883
I cut everything I could without
crippling this department.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.518
Well, then your department
is frozen.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.755
And we'll postpone
your June Academy class.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.758
If we don't bring
those cops on line,

10:43.760 --> 10:46.894
we will be reduced
to 1992 levels.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.296
There's no money, Frank.

10:48.298 --> 10:49.964
I am not raising taxes
because of you.

10:49.966 --> 10:51.532
In an election year.

10:51.534 --> 10:52.700
In any year!

10:52.702 --> 10:55.169
And every department
shares the pain here.

10:55.171 --> 10:57.221
I will not police this city

10:57.223 --> 10:59.473
with those kind
of reductions of force.

10:59.475 --> 11:00.741
And nobody, including you,

11:00.743 --> 11:02.610
will want the kind of pain
it brings.

11:02.612 --> 11:04.378
Now, is that a threat, Frank?

11:04.380 --> 11:06.914
The threat here is
to the citizens who elected you,

11:06.916 --> 11:09.684
and the $30 billion tourist
industry we all depend on.

11:09.686 --> 11:10.985
Give me a break, okay?

11:10.987 --> 11:12.119
And the way you injected racism

11:12.121 --> 11:13.454
into that tourist shooting--
it-it...

11:13.456 --> 11:14.588
Oh, race was

11:14.590 --> 11:15.823
already driving the story.

11:15.825 --> 11:16.957
I just said it out loud.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.376
You're not my
Chamber of Commerce.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.127
Just stick to what you know.

11:20.129 --> 11:21.862
What I know is, you cannot
cut this force any further.

11:21.864 --> 11:23.230
No, you listen to me.

11:23.232 --> 11:25.766
I am going to the City Council
with my budget,

11:25.768 --> 11:28.803
with our Commissioners of Fire,
Sanitation, Transportation--

11:28.805 --> 11:32.005
all who have been
far more cooperative--

11:32.007 --> 11:34.642
and with you,
standing alongside me.

11:34.644 --> 11:36.510
And if you try
to make me look bad,

11:36.512 --> 11:38.446
you'll be bringing
a knife to a gunfight.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.814
I promise you.

11:44.754 --> 11:47.354
All right, well,
there's plenty of motive here.

11:47.356 --> 11:50.057
I mean, there's a giant
insurance policy, and the house.

11:50.059 --> 11:51.826
Yeah, but Ronnie's
not the only one.

11:51.828 --> 11:53.878
I mean, all three of these
kids stand to inherit.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.330
All right,
so Ann Cleary's doorman--

11:56.332 --> 11:57.365
he confirmed the alibi?

11:57.367 --> 11:59.583
Yeah. She came home
as per usual,

11:59.585 --> 12:01.702
though that doesn't mean
she might not've left later,

12:01.704 --> 12:03.387
so we'll check ARGUS
for video footage.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.572
What about Al Cleary?

12:04.574 --> 12:06.574
Al Cleary says
he was home alone.

12:06.576 --> 12:08.225
Gotta try to find something
to corroborate that.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.011
About Al--
the car dealership was failing.

12:11.013 --> 12:13.447
Two salesmen were let go
in the past couple months.

12:13.449 --> 12:16.283
All right, let's make sure
we talk to those two. What else?

12:16.285 --> 12:17.618
So the father's pouring
all of his personal money

12:17.620 --> 12:19.720
into keeping
the business afloat,

12:19.722 --> 12:21.105
and he's taking
out of the inheritance.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.757
Al can't be too happy
about that.

12:22.759 --> 12:24.725
Okay, but money problems.

12:24.727 --> 12:26.777
I mean, the neighbor told me
that old man Cleary

12:26.779 --> 12:28.562
had just booked a
round-the-world cruise trip

12:28.564 --> 12:30.197
for, uh, him and the wife,

12:30.199 --> 12:32.266
That their anniversary was
coming up, and the ticket cost

12:32.268 --> 12:34.568
somewhere in the ballpark
of $100,000.

12:34.570 --> 12:35.736
Well, he may have booked that,

12:35.738 --> 12:37.238
but he hasn't started
payment on that yet.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.091
Reagan.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.609
Yeah.

12:41.611 --> 12:42.676
Curatola.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.379
You got caller ID on that?

12:45.381 --> 12:47.882
Great. Yeah, we're on our way.
Uh-huh.

12:47.884 --> 12:50.151
Okay, got it.
Get your hat and coat.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.652
That was Ronnie's AA sponsor.

12:51.654 --> 12:53.621
He says Ronnie called him
from the Rest-Well Motel.

12:53.623 --> 12:54.688
He sounds suicidal.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.557
Well, FINEST message
paid off, too.

12:56.559 --> 12:58.926
Patrol spotted Cleary's car in
the parking lot of guess where?

12:58.928 --> 13:00.494
Rest-Well Motel. All right.

13:00.496 --> 13:01.762
This is Detective Reagan.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.864
I need a ESU and a patrol
to 85 us forthwith

13:03.866 --> 13:05.766
at the Rest-Well Motel
in Sunset Park.

13:05.768 --> 13:08.452
We got an emotionally disturbed
homicide suspect.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.970
Go on! Go on, shoot me,

13:09.972 --> 13:11.272
you sons of bitches!

13:11.274 --> 13:13.874
Just put down the axe.
We can talk about this.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.376
Nobody wants to hurt you.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.511
I don't want to talk, okay?!

13:17.513 --> 13:20.247
I don't want to talk!
You come up and get me!

13:20.249 --> 13:21.549
Cleary, please, come on now.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.167
Come on. Come on!

13:23.169 --> 13:24.785
Come on!

13:27.123 --> 13:29.056
Go on, shoot!

13:29.058 --> 13:30.341
Okay, what do we got?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.193
He was coming back with
take-out. He's hyped up.

13:32.195 --> 13:34.228
He smashed the firebox
to get an axe.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.130
All right. Probably trying
to commit suicide by cop.

13:36.132 --> 13:37.982
I know this guy,
I can get close to him.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.133
All right? I'm going to take over.
Do it! Do it!

13:40.135 --> 13:42.269
Okay, yeah.
Let me borrow this, all right?

13:42.271 --> 13:43.437
Come on, do it!

13:43.439 --> 13:45.189
Shoot me!

13:45.191 --> 13:45.973
Hey, Ronnie!

13:45.975 --> 13:47.241
Oh.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.109
It's me! It's Danny Reagan!
You remember?

13:49.111 --> 13:51.545
Yeah, I remember you, Danny.
Get out of here! Listen,

13:51.547 --> 13:52.947
I'm just gonna come
talk to you, all right?

13:52.949 --> 13:54.999
I don't want to talk to you, Danny!
Stay calm,

13:55.001 --> 13:56.500
and we'll discuss it,
me and you, okay?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.651
I don't want to talk, Danny!

13:57.653 --> 13:59.170
No, no, look. Come
on, no guns, nothing.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.988
Just me and you, all right?

14:02.591 --> 14:03.924
Don't do nothing stupid!

14:03.926 --> 14:06.177
Don't come any closer!
You get back!

14:06.179 --> 14:08.128
Stay where you are,
you son of a bitch!

14:08.130 --> 14:11.382
Stay where you are!
Don't come any closer to me!

14:11.384 --> 14:13.534
Ronnie. Ronnie!

14:13.536 --> 14:15.035
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

14:15.037 --> 14:16.520
Hold it! Hold it,
hold it! Don't shoot!

14:16.522 --> 14:18.338
Hold it, hold it,
Ronnie, listen to me.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.307
Come on, let's talk.

14:20.309 --> 14:21.475
Me and you now, all right?
Like when we were kids.

14:21.477 --> 14:23.310
Friends, all right?
No. No. No. No.

14:23.312 --> 14:25.345
Come on, you can trust me, Ronnie. Come on.
I don't want to talk, Danny, please.

14:25.347 --> 14:28.616
Please, just let them
kill me. Please.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.284
I can't let them shoot you,
Ronnie, all right?

14:30.286 --> 14:31.785
We're just gonna talk,
me and you, all right?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.588
You're ruining everything, Danny!
Ronnie...

14:34.590 --> 14:35.706
You're ruining it!

14:42.130 --> 14:44.064
Damn it!

14:44.066 --> 14:46.383
Suspect's down.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.501
This is stupid, Ronnie.

14:47.503 --> 14:50.538
We're all clear!

15:03.611 --> 15:05.812
Let's go.

15:07.081 --> 15:08.382
You want anything, Ronnie?

15:08.384 --> 15:10.217
Some water?
Did you eat anything?

15:10.219 --> 15:11.451
Water maybe.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.338
They gave me some crackers
after the psych exam.

15:14.340 --> 15:17.357
That and a clonazepam.
Knock it off.

15:17.359 --> 15:19.393
This isn't some drug possession
or petty larceny case, Ronnie.

15:19.395 --> 15:21.461
It's a double homicide.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.063
You already told me that.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.465
Think you could lose
these cuffs, Danny?

15:25.467 --> 15:27.351
Nah, I can't do that, Ronnie.

15:27.353 --> 15:29.903
Now let's go over this
one more time, okay?

15:29.905 --> 15:31.872
Two people--
your mother and father--

15:31.874 --> 15:34.441
were murdered ten feet
above your head,

15:34.443 --> 15:36.109
and you didn't hear anything?

15:36.111 --> 15:37.444
You don't
remember anything?

15:37.446 --> 15:40.030
I got up that morning to go to work.
Mm-hmm.

15:40.032 --> 15:43.450
I went upstairs to get
some breakfast and...

15:43.452 --> 15:44.718
I saw them like that.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.286
Right.

15:46.288 --> 15:47.387
And what did you do?

15:47.389 --> 15:49.189
Right.

15:49.191 --> 15:50.824
You ran away.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.060
That's your parents, Ronnie.
If you didn't kill them,

15:53.062 --> 15:54.895
then why didn't you call 911?

15:54.897 --> 15:56.930
I didn't want to go to jail.

15:56.932 --> 15:58.165
Then why'd you kill them?

15:58.167 --> 15:59.633
I didn't kill them.

15:59.635 --> 16:00.901
What happened, Ronnie?

16:00.903 --> 16:03.336
You and your old man get
into it again, is that it?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.305
Huh? He found out
you were using again?

16:05.307 --> 16:08.008
No. See, now I know you're
lying to me, Ronnie.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.876
Now I know.

16:09.878 --> 16:11.278
You know why?

16:11.280 --> 16:14.514
'Cause we found the weed, and
we found the prescription vial,

16:14.516 --> 16:17.551
and we found a half-drunk bottle
of vodka under your bed.

16:17.553 --> 16:19.820
I'm not using heroin.

16:19.822 --> 16:21.188
What'd you do, Ronnie?
What'd you do?

16:21.190 --> 16:23.240
You get all juiced up and pass
out and sleep right through

16:23.242 --> 16:24.825
your parents' murder?
Is that what you're telling me?

16:24.827 --> 16:27.127
Was it one of your
blackouts, Ronnie?

16:27.129 --> 16:28.628
Stop it.
Stop what?

16:28.630 --> 16:30.197
I'm not going to stop
a damn thing

16:30.199 --> 16:32.099
until I find out who killed
Kevin and Eunice Cleary.

16:32.101 --> 16:34.200
You follow me?
Why didn't you just let me die?

16:34.202 --> 16:36.052
Why didn't you just let them
shoot me, Danny?

16:36.054 --> 16:37.671
All right, Ronnie, all right.
Let's say it wasn't you, then.

16:37.673 --> 16:38.939
Who did it?

16:38.941 --> 16:41.041
Huh? Who did it
if it wasn't you?

16:41.043 --> 16:44.428
I don't know. Some guy
my old man sold a lemon to?

16:44.430 --> 16:46.045
You knew him, Danny.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.432
Outside of the house
he was Mr. Popularity,

16:48.434 --> 16:50.383
hail-fellow-well-met.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.885
Inside of the house,

16:51.887 --> 16:55.021
a real son of a bitch.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.459
Reagan, talk to you?

16:59.461 --> 17:01.261
Yeah.

17:03.464 --> 17:04.964
Sit tight.

17:07.201 --> 17:09.669
Canine picked up
a scent on these

17:09.671 --> 17:12.571
and found them in a trash can
in a corner of a park nearby.

17:14.291 --> 17:15.876
All right.

17:18.546 --> 17:20.313
These look familiar, Ronnie?

17:22.249 --> 17:23.916
No.
Well, they're yours.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.102
And they're going
down to the lab,

17:26.104 --> 17:28.889
and they're gonna type the blood
in the treads to your mom.

17:28.891 --> 17:31.091
And then they're gonna match
the wear in the treads

17:31.093 --> 17:32.626
to the footprints
found in the blood.

17:32.628 --> 17:34.394
Isn't that right, Ronnie?

17:38.984 --> 17:40.099
Get him down to Central Booking.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.370
No. Oh, no. No...

17:44.539 --> 17:47.874
No. I... please, Danny, don't.
Get out. Get out.

17:47.876 --> 17:49.442
Danny!

17:49.444 --> 17:52.779
There we go.
All right. Thanks.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.948
There you go.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.285
We need to talk, Reagan.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.804
You know, I've been
on the job 20 years.

18:00.806 --> 18:02.389
I've seen everything.

18:02.391 --> 18:05.358
And I got a sixth sense when
someone's trying to BS me.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.395
First, I catch you looking into
this Lydia Gonsalves IAB file,

18:08.397 --> 18:10.981
now this Sonny Malevsky thing.
I told you,

18:10.983 --> 18:13.683
if I can't trust you, how am
I going to ride with you?

18:13.685 --> 18:15.185
That works both ways, kid.

18:15.187 --> 18:16.603
You know what I'm saying?

18:16.605 --> 18:19.072
Huh?

18:19.074 --> 18:20.373
Did you ever...

18:20.375 --> 18:22.108
did you ever hear of
the Blue Templar?

18:22.110 --> 18:23.944
That? Uh-uh.

18:23.946 --> 18:25.662
Not in a thousand years. Why?

18:25.664 --> 18:27.531
What do you know about them?

18:27.533 --> 18:29.816
That the world changed.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.219
We got a more professional
police force now.

18:32.221 --> 18:35.121
No more cowboy posses.

18:35.123 --> 18:36.506
You still didn't tell me why.

18:36.508 --> 18:38.592
I can't tell you that.

18:38.594 --> 18:41.428
You can't or you won't?

18:41.430 --> 18:43.363
You said we gotta...

18:43.365 --> 18:45.332
we gotta trust
each other, Sarge.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.667
I gotta ask you to
trust me on this one.

18:54.275 --> 18:55.875
You got five?

18:55.877 --> 18:58.445
Speech for Knights of Columbus
Monday for you to vet,

18:58.447 --> 19:00.814
in case you have your usual
litany of irritating notes.

19:00.816 --> 19:02.048
Garrett, I'm in no mood.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.067
The budget?

19:04.069 --> 19:07.754
The mayor's insisting I publicly
endorse his budget cuts.

19:07.756 --> 19:08.989
Times are tough.

19:08.991 --> 19:10.690
The practical
is sometimes prudent.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.259
You mean the political.

19:12.261 --> 19:14.327
Of course I do.

19:14.329 --> 19:16.997
I cannot run this department
with a thousand fewer people.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.799
And I can't prove it
unless the crime rate goes up,

19:19.801 --> 19:21.901
at which point it'll be
too late. So, Garrett...

19:21.903 --> 19:24.838
how could we get
out in front of it?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.373
Power of the press?

19:26.375 --> 19:27.841
You tell me.

19:27.843 --> 19:32.279
Mayor to NYPD-- Drop Dead?

19:32.281 --> 19:34.714
Maybe something like that.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.916
You do understand
what you're proposing here.

19:36.918 --> 19:38.618
I'm not proposing anything.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.254
As a matter of fact, I can't
even remember this conversation.

19:41.256 --> 19:43.857
Exactly.

19:43.859 --> 19:45.742
Ray Curston at the paper?

19:45.744 --> 19:47.294
I can't hear you.

19:55.671 --> 19:56.870
Come on.

20:00.608 --> 20:02.575
Aw, man.
What's she doing here?

20:02.577 --> 20:03.910
She wanted to talk to you.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.411
Oh, Ronnie.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.715
You broke my heart
when I was 15.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.216
But what didn't, huh?

20:11.052 --> 20:12.602
All right,
I'm gonna get him started.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.854
So what happened
down there?

20:14.856 --> 20:17.140
I mean, the more we know,
the more we can help you.

20:17.142 --> 20:19.859
No, no, no, no, no, no! No!

20:19.861 --> 20:21.161
I am not going to tell

20:21.163 --> 20:24.263
the Assistant District
Attorney anything, okay?

20:24.265 --> 20:26.566
I may be out of my mind,
but I ain't stupid.

20:26.568 --> 20:28.151
Could've fooled me.

20:28.153 --> 20:29.769
So what do you want? Hmm?

20:29.771 --> 20:30.987
Here I am.

20:30.989 --> 20:32.872
I'm a curiosity to you? Huh?

20:32.874 --> 20:35.108
You don't deal with enough scum
in your line of work?

20:35.110 --> 20:37.377
Hey. Knock it off.
Hey, big brother.

20:37.379 --> 20:40.547
I just wanted to tell you
that I would try to get you

20:40.549 --> 20:41.915
the best Legal Aid
Attorney there is.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.950
Please try to
cooperate with them.

20:43.952 --> 20:47.003
Screw it. I don't care.

20:47.005 --> 20:49.489
Really? Is that why you're
on the verge of tears?

20:49.491 --> 20:52.792
It's just the clonazepam
kicking in.

20:54.428 --> 20:55.461
All right. You ready?

20:55.463 --> 20:57.347
Yeah, let's get him searched.

20:58.482 --> 20:59.983
See you, sis.

21:20.421 --> 21:23.022
Sweetheart.
Hi.

21:23.024 --> 21:24.657
Sorry I'm late.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.426
Meeting ran over?

21:26.428 --> 21:28.211
And over.

21:29.013 --> 21:32.165
I got beat up pretty good.
Yeah?

21:32.167 --> 21:33.049
Who won?

21:33.051 --> 21:35.552
We're in the middle rounds.

21:35.554 --> 21:37.137
Thank you.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.143
So how are you doing?

21:43.145 --> 21:45.044
Fine.

21:45.046 --> 21:48.014
Well, you probably talked
to Ronnie Cleary by now.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.450
Saw him at Central Booking.

21:50.452 --> 21:52.485
Yeah, well, that couldn't
have been easy.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.189
Got me thinking about Joe.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.591
That was a big part
of your childhood,

21:58.593 --> 22:01.327
my three oldest
and the Cleary kids.

22:01.329 --> 22:05.298
Yeah. Ronnie, Joe and I
were like the Three Musketeers.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.634
I was such a tomboy then.

22:07.636 --> 22:09.068
You had a pretty good jump shot.

22:09.070 --> 22:11.771
He was my first kiss.

22:11.773 --> 22:14.207
That I didn't know.

22:14.209 --> 22:17.010
There's a lot
you don't know, Dad.

22:17.012 --> 22:20.814
I think Joe felt
he abandoned Ronnie.

22:20.816 --> 22:23.349
Yeah, we used
to talk about that.

22:23.351 --> 22:26.886
Ronnie dove into that
half-filled swimming pool drunk,

22:26.888 --> 22:28.788
broke his nose.

22:28.790 --> 22:31.458
That was the last straw for Joe.

22:34.495 --> 22:37.464
You think we'll ever stop
missing him?

22:48.275 --> 22:51.628
Yolanda,
I got your message.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.316
Thanks for meeting me.

22:56.318 --> 22:59.786
I knew Detective
Gonsalves had a twin,

22:59.788 --> 23:03.423
but you do, you look
exactly like her.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.658
Must be like seeing a ghost.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.127
Yeah, it is.

23:08.129 --> 23:10.096
How is Lydia's daughter?

23:10.098 --> 23:14.801
She misses her mom,
but she's adjusting.

23:14.803 --> 23:16.102
We're doing okay.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.571
The reason I wanted
to see you,

23:18.573 --> 23:20.773
Lydia left a package for me
with her things.

23:20.775 --> 23:23.276
There were
insurance issues

23:23.278 --> 23:24.477
because of the suicide,

23:24.479 --> 23:26.513
and her estate only recently
became available to me.

23:26.515 --> 23:29.315
She said that if
anything happened to her

23:29.317 --> 23:31.951
that I should
give you this.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.354
And it happened.

23:34.356 --> 23:37.323
Thanks.

23:37.325 --> 23:40.460
I don't think your sister's
death was a suicide.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.062
I never did either.

23:43.064 --> 23:45.031
She loved her little girl...

23:45.033 --> 23:48.167
and all of us.

23:48.169 --> 23:50.703
I'm gonna make it right.

23:51.872 --> 23:53.840
Maybe what's in there will help.

24:16.805 --> 24:19.506
First three ribs, Dad,
prime aged.

24:19.508 --> 24:21.508
Silvano cut it special for you.

24:21.510 --> 24:23.677
And Linda wants me to take it
out of the fridge

24:23.679 --> 24:25.679
before church tomorrow, I know.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.614
Yep. You want something to eat?

24:27.616 --> 24:30.317
Uh, nah,
sugar's good for me.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.104
It looks bad for Ronnie Cleary.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.390
Well, we got good alibis
on everybody.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.559
I mean, even Ann Cleary's
sometimes boyfriend

24:38.561 --> 24:40.861
has been surfing in Costa Rica
for the past month.

24:40.863 --> 24:44.465
Never married, never really
blossomed, Ann Cleary.

24:44.467 --> 24:46.533
Nobody was ever good enough
for their baby.

24:46.535 --> 24:48.836
They always kept her in
Cadillacs and pocket change.

24:48.838 --> 24:50.871
So, what do you got?

24:50.873 --> 24:53.574
Well, we got enough
to make an arrest.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.875
What does Erin say?

24:54.877 --> 24:56.543
Erin says we probably
don't have enough

24:56.545 --> 24:58.412
to get a jury to convict-- we
gotta find the murder weapon.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.982
Well, if it was the kitchen
knife, he lives there.

25:01.984 --> 25:03.484
His DNA's gonna be all over it.

25:03.486 --> 25:05.686
Yeah, same as everything
at the crime scene.

25:05.688 --> 25:07.421
Just...

25:07.423 --> 25:09.022
What?

25:09.024 --> 25:11.859
Well, we found the sneakers
in the opposite direction

25:11.861 --> 25:13.594
of the motel
where we found Ronnie.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.063
So, okay, maybe he didn't know
where he was going,

25:16.065 --> 25:18.432
maybe he was running
around in circles. Who knows?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.467
But it just seems like
we would have found the knife

25:20.469 --> 25:22.186
where we found the sneakers.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.637
And what else?

25:23.639 --> 25:24.705
Well, there's Mrs. Cleary.

25:24.707 --> 25:26.073
I mean,
there's signs of a struggle,

25:26.075 --> 25:28.475
but she's got no genetic
material under her fingernails

25:28.477 --> 25:29.843
except for latex.

25:29.845 --> 25:32.279
The killer used gloves.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.315
Right. Which explains why Ronnie
had no scratches or wounds

25:35.317 --> 25:36.884
on his hands
from the struggle.

25:36.886 --> 25:38.318
Which would mean it wasn't one

25:38.320 --> 25:41.121
of his alcoholic rages--
he planned it.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.356
Right.

25:42.358 --> 25:43.624
Is that what's bothering you?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.959
Well, I mean, it would be
the first time in his life

25:45.961 --> 25:49.263
that Ronnie Cleary
planned anything, Dad.

26:03.411 --> 26:05.446
Hey, I thought you
were a customer.

26:05.448 --> 26:08.215
Ah... You could use a
new car there, Danny.

26:08.217 --> 26:09.199
Think so, huh?
Yeah.

26:09.201 --> 26:13.253
Hey, I can offer
you .9 financing.

26:13.255 --> 26:15.622
Basically, you're paying
for the paperwork.

26:15.624 --> 26:16.907
Ah, my wife likes that one.

26:18.127 --> 26:20.093
Look, I just came by
to ask you a few questions,

26:20.095 --> 26:22.262
you know,
dot a few I's, cross a few T's.

26:22.264 --> 26:27.000
What happened to the whiskey,
beer chaser Danny Reagan of old?

26:27.002 --> 26:28.302
Yeah.
Come on.

26:28.304 --> 26:30.637
Nah, it's just
Detective Reagan now.

26:30.639 --> 26:31.872
Yeah.

26:31.874 --> 26:34.007
What can I do for you,
Detective?

26:34.009 --> 26:36.093
Well, I've been thinking about
this thing, the murders.

26:36.095 --> 26:40.264
They were really,
really well thought out.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.016
It just doesn't seem
like Ronnie, you know?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.552
You're thinking about
the Ronnie that you knew.

26:45.554 --> 26:47.721
The heroin-addict version
our family's been having

26:47.723 --> 26:51.758
to deal with, he is a master
of manipulation and lies.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.560
He played my parents.

26:53.562 --> 26:57.064
He bled them dry with those
stints in the fancy rehab.

26:57.066 --> 27:00.567
That's a very
well-thought-out answer, Al.

27:00.569 --> 27:03.770
What are you trying
to do, Danny?

27:03.772 --> 27:05.105
My job.

27:05.107 --> 27:06.840
You don't think
this has been hard enough?

27:06.842 --> 27:08.542
Why don't you try
thinking about Ronnie?

27:08.544 --> 27:11.378
At least now he'll get
the help that he needs.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.463
They'll make sure
he stays on his meds, right?

27:13.465 --> 27:17.217
Yeah, well,
I just keep thinking about you.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.454
A 42-year-old guy working under
his old man's thumb

27:20.456 --> 27:22.589
day after day,
year after year?

27:22.591 --> 27:24.625
Couldn't be easy.

27:24.627 --> 27:26.727
You should know.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.629
I'm not the only
one taking orders

27:28.631 --> 27:32.132
from my old man
around here. Right?

27:49.851 --> 27:51.618
Have a seat.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.471
Didn't know you guys worked
on Saturday.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.023
Thought you were
nine-to-fivers.

27:56.025 --> 27:59.660
I'm going on vacation next week,
I'm trying to clear my schedule.

27:59.662 --> 28:01.562
This new business
with the missing gun

28:01.564 --> 28:04.431
deserves immediate attention.

28:06.734 --> 28:08.802
My gun was taken from my locker.

28:08.804 --> 28:10.304
Or you sold it to somebody.

28:10.306 --> 28:12.673
I didn't sell it to anybody.
Someone stole it.

28:12.675 --> 28:16.343
A new patrol officer
makes $46,000 a year.

28:16.345 --> 28:22.449
You have $85,000-worth of
student loan debt, Harvard.

28:22.451 --> 28:26.186
Maybe you figured out a way
to make some extra cash.

28:26.188 --> 28:29.590
You have proof that I sold it,
or is that just an accusation?

28:29.592 --> 28:32.192
Are you challenging me, Reagan?

28:32.194 --> 28:33.927
No, sir.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.429
Whether you lost
it or sold it,

28:35.431 --> 28:37.197
that gun is missing,

28:37.199 --> 28:39.366
and it could very easily
fall into the wrong hands.

28:39.368 --> 28:41.368
Show up in a
crime, a murder.

28:41.370 --> 28:43.870
And that'll be a really
bad problem for you.

28:43.872 --> 28:46.206
A real career changer.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.407
You understand?

28:47.409 --> 28:50.210
Yes, I think I do.

28:50.212 --> 28:51.745
Hopefully,
you find that gun, Reagan.

28:51.747 --> 28:53.981
If not, we will launch
a full-blown investigation.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.183
Until then, be
advised we'll be

28:56.185 --> 28:58.418
keeping a close eye on you.

29:00.922 --> 29:03.056
You can go.

29:17.039 --> 29:18.305
Yeah?

29:18.307 --> 29:19.606
He just left.

29:19.608 --> 29:21.091
So what do you think?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.443
I think he's a liability.

29:23.445 --> 29:25.846
Okay.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.024
Done just right, Pop.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.325
Mm-hmm.

29:38.327 --> 29:39.559
And you're not an easy sell.

29:39.561 --> 29:41.428
You've been talking
to the mayor?

29:41.430 --> 29:42.462
How's that going, Dad?

29:42.464 --> 29:44.398
Well, they've
both drawn their lines

29:44.400 --> 29:47.401
in the sand,
but they're worlds apart.

29:47.403 --> 29:48.902
Been a lot of rumbling
from the rank and file

29:48.904 --> 29:50.287
about reduction of force.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.239
Can we talk about something that
doesn't ruin my appetite?

29:53.241 --> 29:55.509
How about the elephant
that's in the room?

29:56.544 --> 29:58.628
Terrible thing, that.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.413
I saw Ann Cleary's car
in the driveway on the way up.

30:00.415 --> 30:01.882
Looks like she's packing
everything.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.751
That's been a unhappy house
for a long time.

30:04.753 --> 30:07.888
Whose house are you
talking about-- cellar boy?

30:08.690 --> 30:09.773
Jack.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.826
What? I heard you and Mom
talking about him.

30:12.828 --> 30:16.129
Danny was telling me
about the father and the kids,

30:16.131 --> 30:17.631
you know,
about Ronnie.

30:17.633 --> 30:18.949
And while it might
sound funny,

30:18.951 --> 30:20.600
the cellar boy thing
is not funny, Jack.

30:20.602 --> 30:22.069
Well, why not?

30:22.071 --> 30:23.737
Dads shouldn't call
their kids names.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.771
It belittles them.

30:24.773 --> 30:26.106
Belittled?

30:26.108 --> 30:27.874
Made them feel bad.

30:27.876 --> 30:29.459
That's right. It makes them
feel bad about themselves

30:29.461 --> 30:30.711
and makes them feel small.

30:30.713 --> 30:31.828
That's what bullies do.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.446
Just like a bully.

30:33.448 --> 30:35.449
So now it's the
father's fault somehow?

30:35.451 --> 30:36.817
The parents made him do it?

30:36.819 --> 30:38.018
Do what?

30:38.020 --> 30:39.786
Would you just focus
on your potatoes, please?

30:39.788 --> 30:41.722
Ronnie's got a
dual diagnosis, Grandpa.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.490
I mean, with a good lawyer

30:43.492 --> 30:44.991
and sympathetic judge,

30:44.993 --> 30:47.327
he'll be put in an
appropriate facility.

30:47.329 --> 30:48.962
Or maybe a sympathetic ADA.

30:48.964 --> 30:51.932
He wasn't mental
enough not to run.

30:51.934 --> 30:57.003
In my book, that's an admission
of guilt and sanity.

30:57.005 --> 30:58.972
Yep. You know, you might be
a hard-ass, Grandpa,

30:58.974 --> 31:01.358
but I'm in lockstep with you
on this one.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.642
Yeah, boys, don't
call anyone names,

31:02.644 --> 31:04.277
but feel free to
swear at the table.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.881
His dad couldn't accept the fact
that his kid was ill.

31:07.883 --> 31:10.350
That was a big part
of the problem over there.

31:10.352 --> 31:11.985
Like I said,

31:11.987 --> 31:13.687
unhappy house.

31:13.689 --> 31:14.888
Happy families are alike.

31:14.890 --> 31:17.491
Unhappy families are unhappy
in their own way.

31:18.926 --> 31:19.960
Who said that?

31:19.962 --> 31:22.229
Other than me? Tolstoy.

31:23.365 --> 31:27.517
Well, I'm glad that I was born
into this family.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.719
Luck of the draw, sweetie.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.304
Hear, hear.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.608
Luck and looking
out for each other.

31:41.048 --> 31:43.200
You taking care
of my car?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.384
I thought it was my car.

31:44.386 --> 31:45.652
It is.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.254
They don't build 'em
like this anymore.

31:47.256 --> 31:49.456
It's... not a
computer anywhere.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.024
It's pure mechanics.

31:51.026 --> 31:52.459
You didn't say much in there.

31:52.461 --> 31:55.662
I was younger than
everybody else.

31:55.664 --> 31:56.963
I didn't really
know that family.

31:56.965 --> 31:58.532
You okay?

31:58.534 --> 31:59.800
I'm fine.

31:59.802 --> 32:00.934
I'm worried about you.

32:00.936 --> 32:02.869
Since when?

32:02.871 --> 32:07.374
Probably ever since
you put on the uniform.

32:07.376 --> 32:08.975
You sorry about the choice
you made?

32:08.977 --> 32:11.711
Hey, Dad,

32:11.713 --> 32:12.846
Mom's tulips are looking great.

32:12.848 --> 32:15.148
Grandpa's really taking
good care of them.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.101
I'm gonna get going.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.753
You sure you don't want
to stick around?

32:19.755 --> 32:21.938
No, I got a
company reunion;

32:21.940 --> 32:24.758
my probationary
graduation party, so...

32:24.760 --> 32:27.194
Careful. I ended up
on my hands and knees

32:27.196 --> 32:28.528
behind a Dumpster
on my night.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.946
Thanks for the visual.

32:30.932 --> 32:32.265
See you guys.

32:32.267 --> 32:35.769
We're making a condolence call
to Ann Cleary.

32:35.771 --> 32:37.003
Yeah, "slash" reinterview.

32:37.005 --> 32:38.088
Erin's my beard.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.206
You want to come?

32:39.208 --> 32:42.342
Not my job.

32:53.254 --> 32:56.656
Well, she's definitely
packing up.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.694
Hi, Annie.

33:00.696 --> 33:03.530
Erin. Hi.

33:08.269 --> 33:11.071
So... heard what you said
to my brother.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.505
That really upset him.

33:12.507 --> 33:14.674
Yeah.
Danny wouldn't be doing his job

33:14.676 --> 33:16.643
if he didn't cover
every angle.

33:16.645 --> 33:18.378
So you think this idea

33:18.380 --> 33:20.881
that Ronnie didn't do it
is just a crazy thought, huh?

33:20.883 --> 33:23.416
I mean, you know Al and
Ronnie hated each other.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.318
I mean, Al was embarrassed
by Ronnie.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.187
Got his teeth
knocked out by Ronnie.

33:27.189 --> 33:30.457
You know all the juicy details
about the Clearys, huh?

33:30.459 --> 33:32.259
The famous
Reagan Sunday dinner.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.361
I bet we were the topic
of conversation.

33:34.363 --> 33:37.430
Ronnie always used to rub it
into my folks--

33:37.432 --> 33:40.267
why can't we be
more like the Reagans?

33:40.269 --> 33:41.501
That's not fair, Annie.

33:41.503 --> 33:42.836
Well, you
should understand

33:42.838 --> 33:44.738
what it feels like, Erin.

33:44.740 --> 33:47.240
I mean, this divorce
can't be easy for you.

33:47.242 --> 33:50.443
And to think that your misery
is the... the fodder

33:50.445 --> 33:52.779
for other people's gossip,
that hurts, right?

33:52.781 --> 33:54.781
Yeah, it does.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.952
Well, I just... wanted you
to know what it feels like.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.624
Sorry. I've got work to do.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.326
Annie, hold on a second.

34:06.328 --> 34:09.929
Um, look,
I'm sorry if I upset you.

34:11.866 --> 34:13.466
The good news is,
we found the knife.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.335
Yeah.

34:15.337 --> 34:16.770
We're expecting the lab results
back tomorrow.

34:16.772 --> 34:18.038
Probably won't find
much 'cause we're

34:18.040 --> 34:19.472
pretty sure the
killer wore gloves,

34:19.474 --> 34:20.806
but, you know,

34:20.809 --> 34:22.641
maybe we'll get lucky.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.712
Wow. Poor Ronnie.

34:30.051 --> 34:32.485
Hey.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.087
You found the
murder weapon?

34:34.089 --> 34:37.123
No. Just shaking the tree
to see if anything falls out.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.391
Is that why you subpoenaed

34:39.393 --> 34:41.578
all the phone calls
for her and Al?

34:41.580 --> 34:44.364
If I'm right, she's probably
calling Al right now.

36:31.076 --> 36:33.378
Just like you thought, Reagan,

36:33.402 --> 36:35.502
soon as you
leave the house,

36:35.504 --> 36:36.736
sister called
her brother.

36:36.738 --> 36:38.705
Yep, and found
out he was here.

36:38.707 --> 36:41.241
Though it's funny they
were smart enough not to, uh,

36:41.243 --> 36:43.910
speak over the phone
just in case we were tapped in.

36:43.912 --> 36:46.146
We wait.

36:46.148 --> 36:47.647
Yeah, we do.

36:47.649 --> 36:49.683
It's Sunday night, Reagan.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.518
I'm missing my Chinese spareribs

36:51.520 --> 36:53.620
and martinis.

36:53.622 --> 36:56.056
Gin and grease--
it's a food group, you know.

36:56.058 --> 36:58.625
This works out,
I'll treat you to Peter Luger's.

37:01.395 --> 37:02.729
Well, well, well.

37:02.731 --> 37:05.232
Ooh. I'm getting a T-bone,
medium rare.

37:17.545 --> 37:19.579
Looks like they're having

37:19.581 --> 37:20.981
a little difference
of opinion.

37:49.644 --> 37:51.678
What did I tell you?
Drop the knife.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.746
You stupid...

37:52.748 --> 37:53.980
Shut up.
You shut up.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.181
Drop the knife right now!

37:55.183 --> 37:57.684
Damn it, Ann! You idiot!

38:11.382 --> 38:12.932
<i>Mounted Unit graduation</i>

38:12.934 --> 38:14.968
has been moved to 1500.

38:14.970 --> 38:16.803
Bronx DA
has called twice already.

38:16.805 --> 38:18.405
Screw you, Frank.

38:20.441 --> 38:21.975
"Mayor's Draconian budget cuts

38:21.977 --> 38:23.877
"deny training
to New York City's best

38:23.879 --> 38:25.512
and brightest
future police officers."

38:25.514 --> 38:26.680
Blah, blah, blah.

38:26.682 --> 38:28.848
Oh, and look at
the pictures-- women and...

38:28.850 --> 38:30.617
and ethnics and veterans.

38:30.619 --> 38:33.286
Yeah, I-I'm like Scrooge
and the Grinch rolled into one.

38:33.288 --> 38:35.588
You screwed me.

38:35.590 --> 38:37.424
Screw you.

38:38.592 --> 38:40.860
You think I had something
to do with that?

38:41.696 --> 38:42.962
Of course, you did!

38:42.964 --> 38:45.065
No, sir.

38:45.067 --> 38:47.167
Well, how did they
get onto it?

38:47.169 --> 38:49.903
How did they get in contact
with those cadets?

38:49.905 --> 38:52.472
Well, last time I checked,
we live in a democracy,

38:52.474 --> 38:54.507
and I do not run
a secret police.

38:54.509 --> 38:57.043
If I can't deliver
a balanced budget,

38:57.045 --> 38:58.678
the State takes over.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.180
Now, do you have any idea

39:00.182 --> 39:02.349
what those hillbillies
upstate will do

39:02.351 --> 39:03.466
to your beloved department

39:03.468 --> 39:05.452
if they get control
of our finances?

39:05.454 --> 39:09.289
Boy. What are you going to do?

39:09.291 --> 39:11.291
I'm going to find
the money somewhere.

39:11.293 --> 39:14.194
But be forewarned, you
and your plausible deniability--

39:14.196 --> 39:16.463
I mean, it ain't
going to fly no more.

39:27.908 --> 39:29.376
Mayor's a little cranky.

39:29.378 --> 39:33.913
He's sensitive about an article
in this morning's paper.

39:41.889 --> 39:44.090
I'll be at my desk.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.811
He ought to be
thanking you.

39:47.813 --> 39:50.263
Oh, I don't think we're
in any danger of that.

39:50.265 --> 39:52.065
Well, someday
he's going to wake up

39:52.067 --> 39:54.467
and realize just how lucky he is
to have you.

39:54.469 --> 39:56.319
Or that.

39:56.321 --> 39:58.855
The, uh,
Knights of Columbus speech--

39:58.857 --> 40:01.775
I counted 23 metaphors
in five pages.

40:01.777 --> 40:03.643
Got to be a personal worst.

40:03.645 --> 40:05.662
I'll polish it before breakfast.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.614
I'm the police commissioner,
not a politician.

40:07.616 --> 40:10.450
Don't imagine swelling music
when you write for me.

40:10.452 --> 40:12.118
Just sirens and gunfire?

40:12.120 --> 40:15.622
Just... plain and honest.

40:27.802 --> 40:29.002
Erin.

40:29.004 --> 40:31.471
Ronnie. Hi.

40:31.473 --> 40:33.139
I'm so happy.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.607
I mean, I'm sad
about your parents,

40:34.609 --> 40:37.143
but I'm glad you're not
taking the fall for it.

40:38.446 --> 40:41.014
It's really hard
to wrap my head around it.

40:41.016 --> 40:43.683
Yeah. Um, have a seat.

40:46.019 --> 40:48.455
Ann confessed to
the whole thing.

40:48.457 --> 40:50.023
It was Al's idea.

40:50.025 --> 40:51.724
I guess the money
your parents

40:51.726 --> 40:53.326
were going to
spend on that trip

40:53.328 --> 40:54.794
was a tipping point for him.

40:54.796 --> 40:58.798
I just keep thinking
about that night.

40:59.884 --> 41:01.267
It's just a blank.

41:01.269 --> 41:05.338
Well, Ann laced your grapefruit
juice with sleeping pills.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.674
She knew you were on
a greyhound bender.

41:08.909 --> 41:11.845
Al wore your shoes
through their blood.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.614
How could he do that to me?

41:14.616 --> 41:15.915
To them?

41:15.917 --> 41:17.951
I don't know, Ronnie.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.986
They were going to
plant the knife

41:19.988 --> 41:22.989
and your shirt, soaked
in your parents' blood,

41:22.991 --> 41:25.725
near your motel to
seal your fate.

41:27.128 --> 41:29.662
How could they be
so cold-blooded?

41:29.664 --> 41:32.565
I guess the short version
is, they felt cheated.

41:32.567 --> 41:34.701
The long version-- you tell me.

41:34.703 --> 41:36.236
I don't know.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.739
I don't know.

41:39.741 --> 41:42.075
What are you going to do now?

41:43.944 --> 41:45.311
Stay clean?

41:45.313 --> 41:48.047
I'm not looking for a right
or wrong answer, Ronnie.

41:48.049 --> 41:49.582
Oh.

41:49.584 --> 41:51.618
I can't live
in that house anymore.

41:51.620 --> 41:53.953
I'm rich, I guess, sort of.

41:53.955 --> 41:55.755
What do you think I should do?

41:56.607 --> 41:58.024
You know I'm single.

41:58.026 --> 41:59.993
And rich.

41:59.995 --> 42:02.028
I mentioned that.

42:02.030 --> 42:04.397
That's very sweet, Ronnie.

42:04.399 --> 42:06.499
I think I'll go down
to Florida.

42:06.501 --> 42:08.902
I got a kid
down there somewhere.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.787
Will you stay in touch?

42:10.789 --> 42:13.439
Definitely.

42:14.742 --> 42:16.743
Erin, I hope you know
how lucky you are.

42:16.745 --> 42:18.945
I do.

42:22.883 --> 42:24.617
What's going on, kid?

42:29.223 --> 42:31.624
Something you should hear.

42:33.294 --> 42:34.561
JOE
I'm getting close,

42:34.563 --> 42:36.062
but the Templar
may have made me.

42:36.064 --> 42:37.163
That's Joe.

42:37.165 --> 42:38.498
The night he
was killed.

42:38.500 --> 42:42.802
He was working with the FBI,
investigating the Blue Templar.

42:42.804 --> 42:44.771
What?

42:44.773 --> 42:47.607
I should have told you
a long time ago, Danny.

42:47.609 --> 42:49.642
Does Dad know?

42:49.644 --> 42:51.978
No.
