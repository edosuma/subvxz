00:05.135 --> 00:06.223
Nolan:
Previously on "The Rookie"...

00:06.267 --> 00:07.659
- And he had an accent.
- He was Russian.

00:07.703 --> 00:08.747
We've been hearing
rumors about

00:08.791 --> 00:10.097
a potential terror attack
for weeks.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.533
- Who are you?
- Simone Clark.

00:11.576 --> 00:12.664
You're the only one
in that room

00:12.708 --> 00:14.797
who actually knows
our Mr. Freemont.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.581
- Miss Clark, is that you?
- Yes, honey.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.193
Give me a real reason
why you're doing this.

00:19.236 --> 00:23.110
Daddy, Black women make up
less than 1% of the FBI.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.329
We need a voice
on the inside.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.939
Suspect says
he'll only talk to you.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.115
I'm in real trouble, huh?

00:28.158 --> 00:29.681
I'm afraid you are.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.682
He paid you to build a bomb
for him?

00:30.726 --> 00:32.206
Just the detonators.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.250
What did he steal
from my armory?

00:33.294 --> 00:35.557
200 kilos
of C-4 explosives.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.515
Quickest way to cripple this
city -- take out the freeways.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.953
It's vital that you follow
your driving route exactly.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.101
I need a chopper at my location
in two minutes.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.624
Harper and Lopez
have something.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.627
Uh, so, we did a deep dive
on the Trevor Gurin alias.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.152
He rented five box trucks yesterday.

01:05.195 --> 01:09.286
So he made five truck bombs with
GPS triggers and stolen C-4?

01:09.330 --> 01:10.766
<i>Yeah, according to</i> <i>
the rental place,</i>

01:10.809 --> 01:12.681
<i>the trucks are each decorated
with a different state --</i>

01:12.724 --> 01:14.770
Alaska, Florida,
Kentucky, Idaho, and Utah.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.206
We gotta
shut the city down.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.121
Shut down all the traffic
in Los Angeles?

01:18.165 --> 01:20.080
She's right. Better to overreact
than under.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.907
You know, car rental places
put GPS trackers

01:21.951 --> 01:23.561
in a lot of
their rental vehicles.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.041
<i>Yeah,</i> <i>
we asked about that.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.695
<i>The manager said that</i> <i>
all the trucks are wired</i>

01:26.738 --> 01:29.437
<i>but the data is collected</i> <i>
in a central hub out of state,</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:31.743
<i>so we're gonna need
a federal warrant to access it.</i>

01:31.787 --> 01:33.136
- I'm on it.
- In the meantime,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.877
get out county-wide BOLOs
on the trucks

01:34.920 --> 01:36.226
<i>and mobilize</i> <i>
the bomb squad.</i>

01:36.270 --> 01:38.098
Alright,
everybody with a pulse,

01:38.141 --> 01:39.229
get in your car
and hit the streets.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.231
Find those trucks.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.494
Tell units to proceed
with extreme caution, okay?

01:43.538 --> 01:45.061
We don't know who's driving
these things or whether

01:45.105 --> 01:46.541
they're part of a terror cell.

01:46.584 --> 01:47.716
There's my ride. I'm going up
to provide overwatch.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.152
I'll come with you.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.763
- Wanna ride with me?
- I thought you'd never ask.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.353
Sgt. Grey: <i>How the hell</i> <i>
are we gonna find them?</i>

02:16.397 --> 02:19.269
<i>Manpower.</i> <i>
And prayer.</i>

02:41.857 --> 02:43.685
<i>Oh, no!</i>

02:43.728 --> 02:45.469
<i>Control, we got an explosion</i> <i>
downtown</i>

02:45.513 --> 02:47.254
<i>south of</i> <i>
the Staples Center.</i>

02:47.297 --> 02:48.690
<i>Mobilize fire and rescue.</i>

02:48.733 --> 02:50.518
<i>Sirs, do you want us</i> <i>
to divert to the scene?</i>

02:50.561 --> 02:52.433
<i>That's a negative. We need to
find the other trucks now!</i>

02:52.476 --> 02:53.999
<i>Roger that.</i>

02:54.043 --> 02:55.740
Officer Innis: <i>
7-Adam-13 arriving on scene.</i>

02:55.784 --> 02:58.003
<i>Freeway has partially collapsed</i> <i>
at West 12.</i>

02:58.047 --> 02:59.135
Officer Brody: <i>
There are multiple vehicles</i> <i>
crushed in the wreckage.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.876
<i>I need help here.</i> What happened?

03:00.919 --> 03:03.966
He just blew up a section
of the 110.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.011
Okay,
we need to focus.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.622
If we are assuming
that he is targeting

03:07.665 --> 03:09.189
all the major freeways,

03:09.232 --> 03:12.235
we need units on the 10,
the 405, and the 101.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.846
But at which spots?
L.A. has 500 miles of freeway.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.635
How is this real?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.854
Two days ago,
I was being lectured

03:22.898 --> 03:24.813
on the proper way
to do paperwork in the FBI.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.945
That's the way
this job works.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.469
The daily swing
between tedium and tragedy

03:28.512 --> 03:29.905
will give you whiplash.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.167
Well,
don't get me wrong.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.735
Being a guidance counselor
was the same way.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.738
One minute, you're helping a kid
do a college essay.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.740
And the next, you're talking
someone off a ledge --

03:38.783 --> 03:40.350
literally.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.873
It's like I said.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.658
That's the experience
that'll give you a leg up

03:43.701 --> 03:45.225
over your fellow trainees.

03:45.268 --> 03:48.140
We may not have the speed
or endurance those kids have,

03:48.184 --> 03:50.099
but we have a hell of a lot more
life experience.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.841
I wish we could use
that experience to stop a bomb.

03:52.884 --> 03:53.972
We can try.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.931
You want me to think
like a terrorist?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.802
No. Like a commuter.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.848
Right.

03:59.891 --> 04:03.286
Where in the city is traffic
the biggest pain in the ass?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.723
The bottlenecks,
the choke points. The --

04:05.767 --> 04:07.290
You got something?

04:07.334 --> 04:09.118
Yep. Head north.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.175
There's Florida.

04:23.219 --> 04:26.135
7-Adam-100 in pursuit
of Truck Florida.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.397
Heading south on Crenshaw.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.318
Get your hands
- outside the vehicle!
- Whoa, whoa!

04:35.362 --> 04:36.711
I want you to open the door
from the outside

04:36.754 --> 04:37.712
- and get out of the truck!
- Okay!

04:37.755 --> 04:39.322
Let's go!
Whoa!

04:39.366 --> 04:41.150
- Put your hands on the hood!
- What the hell's happening?!

04:41.193 --> 04:42.934
- Where are the trucks headed?
- What? I don't know.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.936
Is there a manual trigger
- for your bomb?
- What bomb?

04:44.980 --> 04:46.764
What the hell's
going on here?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.200
We don't have time for this.
Where are the three other
trucks heading?

04:48.244 --> 04:49.463
I don't know.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.378
The guy said it was
a traffic study, okay?

04:51.421 --> 04:53.771
He paid us each 100 bucks
to drive a precise route!

04:53.815 --> 04:55.120
Control, 7-Adam-100.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.471
We stopped the Florida truck,
one in custody.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.211
He seems to have no clue
there's a bomb on his truck.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.431
<i>Does he know anything</i> <i>
about the other targets?</i>

05:01.475 --> 05:02.911
Negative.
It seems the other trucks

05:02.954 --> 05:04.608
are being driven by innocents,
so even if we stop them,

05:04.652 --> 05:06.088
we won't be able to
stop the bomber.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.090
Garza: <i>There!</i>

05:08.133 --> 05:09.831
<i>All units,
I have eyes on Truck Idaho</i>

05:09.874 --> 05:13.225
<i>heading west on Olympic,
two blocks east of the 405.</i>

05:13.269 --> 05:16.620
<i>That's west on Olympic,
two blocks east of the 405.</i>

05:25.368 --> 05:27.283
<i>They got him.</i> <i>Thank God.</i>

05:27.327 --> 05:30.678
Hey, Sarge, it's Smitty.
We just stopped a truck, too.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.245
Truck Utah,
driver in custody.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.856
<i>Smitty!</i>

05:34.899 --> 05:37.641
<i>I take back every negative
thing I've ever said about you.</i>

05:37.685 --> 05:40.688
What? You've said negative
things about me?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.516
<i>We might just</i> <i>
pull this off.</i>

05:42.559 --> 05:46.215
<i>All units, the fourth truck</i> <i>
has safely been stopped.</i>

05:46.258 --> 05:48.826
<i>That leaves Truck Kentucky</i> <i>
in play.</i>

05:48.870 --> 05:50.785
<i>Given the previous targets,</i> <i>
our best guess is</i>

05:50.828 --> 05:52.613
<i>that he's headed</i> <i>
for the 101.</i>

05:52.656 --> 05:54.266
Fox: <i>
Sir, I got the GPS feed.</i>

05:54.310 --> 05:56.356
The final truck is heading north
on Tujunga.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.227
<i>They're only a block away</i> <i>
from the freeway.</i>

06:01.448 --> 06:03.319
Nolan: <i>7-Adam-15.</i>

06:03.363 --> 06:05.408
We're on intercept course,
approaching the freeway now.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.976
<i>♪ Pop the trunk,</i> <i>
got the axe and a shovel ♪</i>

06:08.019 --> 06:09.151
<i>♪ Black supremacists</i>

06:09.194 --> 06:10.239
You realize
if this guy doesn't stop,

06:10.282 --> 06:11.501
we're gonna have to
ram him.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.982
You want to ram a truck
full of explosives?

06:14.025 --> 06:15.897
C-4 requires a detonator
to explode.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.377
But fuel
only needs a spark.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.248
If you have a better idea,
I'm all ears.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.424
<i>♪ Blood clot, all my...</i> There he is!

06:21.468 --> 06:24.079
<i>♪ If you ill,</i> <i>

<i>♪ Point 'em out</i>

06:25.515 --> 06:27.212
<i>♪ If you see a real playa,</i> <i>
point 'em out ♪</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:48.364
Don't move.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.974
You okay?

06:50.018 --> 06:51.149
I think so.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.542
That was so stupid.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.153
She's pretty judgy
for a first responder.

06:55.197 --> 06:57.591
Oh, it's because
she actually lives with me.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.507
- Cute. You did good.
- Oh, trust me, I know.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.682
Did either of you lose
consciousness in the crash?

07:01.725 --> 07:02.683
No.
Nuh-uh.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.467
What about pain?
Oh, yeah.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.470
But closer to a tequila hangover
than natural childbirth.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.038
- Thank God.
- Sir, Nolan and Clark are conscious and ambulatory.

07:10.081 --> 07:13.433
<i>Good. Get them out of there and</i> <i>
fall back to a safe distance.</i>

07:13.476 --> 07:15.304
<i>That bomb could still go off.</i>

07:15.347 --> 07:18.089
Garza: <i>We need to shut down
the 101 from the 170 to Laurel.</i>

07:18.133 --> 07:21.179
<i>Coordinate with CHP,
Sheriff's Department.</i>

07:21.223 --> 07:23.399
<i>Hell, mobilize the postal
police if you have to.</i>

07:23.443 --> 07:24.966
<i>Just get that roadway</i> <i>
cleared.</i>

07:30.275 --> 07:32.800
<i>As awful as it is,
it could've been a lot worse.</i>

07:32.843 --> 07:34.454
<i>Still could be.</i>

07:34.497 --> 07:36.673
<i>Who knows what this guy</i> <i>
is planning next?</i>

07:36.717 --> 07:38.283
<i>I think I'm gonna pay the CIA</i> <i>
a visit.</i>

07:38.327 --> 07:39.676
<i>You want me</i> <i>
to drop you off?</i>

07:39.720 --> 07:42.070
<i>Hell no.</i> <i>
Let's go jack 'em up.</i>

07:54.822 --> 07:57.172
<i>The death toll is estimated</i> <i>
at 17</i>

07:57.215 --> 07:59.391
<i>with at least two dozen</i> <i>
injured,</i>

07:59.435 --> 08:01.393
<i>and that number is</i> <i>
expected to rise</i>

08:01.437 --> 08:03.570
<i>as rescue crews dig through</i> <i>
the wreckage</i>

08:03.613 --> 08:05.572
<i>of that fallen overpass.</i>

08:05.615 --> 08:08.052
Hey, Tim sent me back to help.
What can I do?

08:08.096 --> 08:10.272
We just got a photo of our guy
from the rental place.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.056
Harper is running it now
through VICAP,

08:12.100 --> 08:13.144
and we just sent it
to Fox

08:13.188 --> 08:14.885
to run through
the federal databases.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.060
Are they gonna release that
to the public?

08:16.104 --> 08:17.279
That was my recommendation,

08:17.322 --> 08:19.281
but the feds want to study
the issue first.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.457
In the meantime, we're sending
every available officer

08:21.501 --> 08:23.546
to roust their C.I.s
and show them the picture.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.113
I need you running
our Command Center.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.898
All intel, all leads, all data
filters through you.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.074
CC the FBI on everything,
but don't give out anything

08:30.118 --> 08:32.033
to patrol
without my say so.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.600
Cool?
Yep. You've got it.

08:33.643 --> 08:34.731
Um, where's Grey?

08:34.775 --> 08:36.037
Paying a visit to the CIA.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.474
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Bill August.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.476
Matthew Garza.
This is Wade Grey.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.565
Hey. You're
the station chief?

08:42.609 --> 08:45.220
Why don't we save the specifics
until we get into the SCIF?

08:45.263 --> 08:46.830
Follow me.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.615
Fair enough.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.792
Gentlemen.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.620
We can talk freely
in here.

08:56.274 --> 08:57.841
How can I help?

08:57.885 --> 09:00.844
We think our terror suspect
might have ties to the CIA.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.368
- Why?
- Sgt. Grey: When we ran his fingerprints,

09:03.412 --> 09:06.589
they came back as classified --
out of Groom Lake.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.026
That's unsettling. I mean,
there's a million reasons

09:09.070 --> 09:11.115
why something gets classified
inside the agency.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.508
Honestly, it's kind of
a default action.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.815
You recognize this man?

09:17.078 --> 09:19.515
No.
Is that your suspect?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.039
- Mm-hmm.
- And according to witnesses, very Russian.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.477
Well, again, unsettling,

09:25.521 --> 09:27.567
but I'm not sure
how I can help <i>you.</i>

09:27.610 --> 09:30.047
I'm sure being a station chief
seems like a big deal,

09:30.091 --> 09:32.789
and it is in Moscow or Seoul,
but in L.A.,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.357
it's a sign of
a senior officer on the margins,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.359
so... That's very humble of you.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.795
Oh, I'm anything but humble, Sergeant.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.449
Just trying
to set expectations.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.668
So that when you're not helpful,
we won't hold it against you?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.278
Hold on, Matt.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.237
Let's give the guy a chance
to be a team player.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.935
What do you know
about Enervo?

09:47.978 --> 09:50.981
Nothing.
What is it?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.201
Well, current thinking is
it's an Agency Black Op.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.463
Based on what evidence?

09:54.506 --> 09:56.334
Suspect had it written down
in his house.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.948
Look, gentlemen, I know
you're trying to get this guy.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.776
And I respect that.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.953
He committed a heinous
terrorist act on your watch.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.781
But I resent you
coming down here

10:07.824 --> 10:08.869
and trying to hang it
on the Agency.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.653
We're not looking
to assign blame.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.656
We need to catch this guy
before he kills anyone else.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.136
We're hoping
you can help us.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.181
Of course.

10:17.225 --> 10:20.402
I'll look into
the fingerprint classification.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.012
You give me a copy
of that photo,

10:22.056 --> 10:23.535
I'll kick it to D.O.,
see if it rings any bells.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.929
- Thank you.
- You bet.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.200
Problem?

10:36.244 --> 10:38.463
Maybe.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.378
Get the band warmed up.

10:42.032 --> 10:45.166
Why aren't you
in a hospital bed?

10:45.209 --> 10:47.255
Because I'm fine, Daddy.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.648
John, Bailey,
this is Cutty.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.824
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.261
You're palling around
with the LAPD now?

10:53.304 --> 10:56.786
Forgive him.
He's mad at me, not you.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.179
We're in the middle
of a thing

10:58.222 --> 11:00.398
because he's unhappy
with my career choice.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.226
But deep down inside,

11:02.270 --> 11:04.359
he's just afraid that
something is gonna happen to me.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.231
But he should stop being mad
and give me a hug

11:07.275 --> 11:10.321
because I was really scared
I was gonna die today

11:10.365 --> 11:14.717
and leave my babies all alone
with a grumpy old grandpa

11:14.761 --> 11:17.415
who doesn't know how to read
the emotional room.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.769
Come here.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.034
Ah, I gotta get down
to the truck.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.862
We're headed
to the freeway collapse.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.820
But listen, I need you
to stop almost dying.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.648
I'll stop taking risks
when you do.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.519
- You don't fight fair.
- Later.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.219
Doc released you already?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.742
Yeah, ready to go
back to work.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.743
Ooh, me too.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.005
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.267
You're a trainee.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.269
They shouldn't be putting you
in harm's way.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.488
Daddy.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.185
Actually, sir,
your daughter has been vital

11:48.229 --> 11:50.013
to the progress we've made
on the case so far.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.276
If you're up for it,

11:52.320 --> 11:55.845
I was about to head into the
office to start crunching data,

11:55.889 --> 11:57.064
combing through
the tip-line records.

11:57.107 --> 12:01.285
Sounds safe.
I-I approve.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.460
Of course you do.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.289
Come on.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.595
Thank you for that.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.598
No problem. I've been there
with my parents.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.600
I picked you up
some fresh clothes.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.776
Just guessed
at your sizes.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.909
Looking out for me <i>
and</i> checking me out?

12:15.952 --> 12:16.736
Okay.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.566
Alright,
what's the next step?

12:21.610 --> 12:22.916
Grey struck out
with the station chief.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.134
Asked me to make contact

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
with one of my old pals
in Operations.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.311
You think he'll know
something about Enervo?

12:27.355 --> 12:28.748
She. Kate Hill.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.097
She ran Operations
for the CIA

12:30.140 --> 12:31.315
in Northern Iraq
when I was there.

12:31.359 --> 12:32.577
Let's see
what she has to say.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.140
It's starting to sink in,
isn't it?

13:57.184 --> 13:58.968
It's just
low blood sugar.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.230
Probably need to
get something to eat.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.233
Don't do that.
Trust me.

14:03.277 --> 14:06.106
The harder you push it down,
the harder it comes back up.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.760
You almost died.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.327
No one walks away
from that unchanged.

14:10.371 --> 14:14.549
I thought I was gonna be blown
into a million little pieces.

14:14.592 --> 14:18.292
Nothing even left
for my twins to bury.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.902
You got kids?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.773
Ha! I have cats.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.951
Who'd miss me for, what,
10, 20 seconds, tops?

14:24.994 --> 14:27.736
You gotta have <i>somebody</i>
outside this job.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.738
I mean, other than
your judgy parents.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.914
There was a girl I picked up
at a bar last week.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.309
Okay! Now we talking.
What's her name?

14:35.352 --> 14:37.311
I don't remember.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.704
One-night stands
are kind of my specialty.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.358
Keeps me focused
on the job.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.620
Well, was it good
at least?

14:42.664 --> 14:44.448
Ooh!

14:44.492 --> 14:45.885
Damn, okay!

14:45.928 --> 14:49.236
My last boyfriend broke up
with me when he found out

14:49.279 --> 14:51.847
that I sometimes
have girlfriends.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.849
And my last girlfriend
broke up with me

14:53.893 --> 14:55.242
when I joined the FBI, so...

14:55.285 --> 14:56.852
She was smart.
What?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.680
This job's a straight-up
serial killer

14:58.723 --> 14:59.899
when it comes
to relationships.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.291
Maybe for you.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.119
But I know how to balance
my work and personal life.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.512
Oh, really?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.166
Yeah, you <i>were,</i>

15:06.209 --> 15:07.994
when you were a high-school
guidance counselor.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.778
Hours were, what,
8:00 to 4:00?

15:09.821 --> 15:11.606
And you had summers off.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.043
The FBI
has no set schedule,

15:14.087 --> 15:17.873
no agent development days
where the criminals stay home.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.529
Once you clock in,
you never really clock out.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.282
Thank you
for meeting us.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.240
I almost didn't.
Can't be a coincidence

15:37.284 --> 15:39.677
that the first time I hear
from you in years is today.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.811
No. We think our suspect might
be connected to the Agency.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.988
That's above my pay grade.
Go talk to a GS-14.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.381
My boss did.
He's getting the runaround.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.165
And you expect me to stick
my neck out for you

15:49.209 --> 15:51.602
'cause we hooked up once
under the rockets' red glare?

15:51.646 --> 15:53.691
No. Because innocent people
are dead.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.866
What do you know
about Enervo?

15:56.303 --> 15:57.521
Nothing.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.914
Bull.
What does it mean?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.743
It means
you just nuked me.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.005
That's a little dramatic,
don't you think?

16:03.049 --> 16:05.399
No.
He called me at work.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.705
And I would bet money that
somebody used the "E" name

16:07.749 --> 16:09.055
on an unsecured cellphone

16:09.098 --> 16:11.100
where it was captured
by an NSA keyword program

16:11.144 --> 16:13.885
that triggered an <i>immediate</i>
tactical response.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.017
Hell, there's probably
a predator drone

16:15.061 --> 16:17.280
- up there right now.
- Kate. It --

16:17.324 --> 16:18.586
Damn it!

16:23.373 --> 16:26.159
Yeah, don't do that.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.205
You lose a shooting war
10 times out of 10.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.424
Hi, Kate.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.599
Colin,
I didn't say anything.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.035
Yeah,
I'm sure you didn't,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.646
but we still need to
go talk about it.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.301
Who are you?
Kate's ride to work.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.738
Well, she doesn't
want to go with you.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.959
Yeah, no one ever does, but this
is a national security matter,

16:44.003 --> 16:46.222
so go ahead and step back

16:46.266 --> 16:47.919
and allow her
to get in the vehicle.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.748
I know you think
you're protecting her,

16:50.792 --> 16:52.228
but you're only
making it worse.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.361
It's okay.
Alright?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.498
Have a nice day, Officers.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.030
<i>And you're sure</i> <i>
they were CIA?</i>

17:11.073 --> 17:12.379
Yes, sir.
There were eight of them,

17:12.422 --> 17:13.728
plain clothes, no credentials.
Kate knew them.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.208
Clearly, they're afraid
we'll get her to talk,

17:15.251 --> 17:16.165
which means whatever she knows
is bad for the Agency.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.253
We need to
get her back, now.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.690
Sir, I slipped my mobile
into her jacket pocket.

17:19.734 --> 17:20.778
We can use that
to track her.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.128
Great work, Nolan.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.825
Alright, stand by while
we get a trace going.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.829
Elena. Six things. Ready?
One, call Senator "Smith."

17:27.872 --> 17:29.744
Tell him "The Postman
walked the dog."

17:29.787 --> 17:31.485
Two, notify the state's
attorney's office.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.530
I need Dr. Reaser here now.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.532
Three, track
and activate a cell

17:35.576 --> 17:37.795
for LAPD officer John Nolan, badge...

17:37.839 --> 17:40.624
25253.
That.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.018
Four, I need an AWAX
above 20,000 feet.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.020
Tell them Senator Smith
authorized it.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.416
Five, move Polaris 11 to
longitude 34.052 degrees north

17:49.459 --> 17:51.635
and 118.24 degrees west.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.160
Finally, mobilize HRT
for a hostage rescue.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.944
Get all that? Good.
Love you.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.557
What?

18:00.601 --> 18:03.125
You say "love you" when ending
calls with your assistant?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.561
All that cool stuff
I just said

18:04.605 --> 18:06.563
and that's what
you're interested in?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.132
My assistant happens
to be my niece.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.962
Oh, come on, like there's
no nepotism in the LAPD.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.182
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just driving.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.627
Damn it.
Turn around.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.455
Tim:
Come out of the car!

18:28.498 --> 18:29.891
Hands where I can see them.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.589
Because you lose this
shooting war 10 times out of 10.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.290
Kate, you can
come out, too.

18:37.333 --> 18:41.468
You're interfering with
a national security operation.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.644
Is that right? Maybe you could
come down to the station,

18:43.687 --> 18:44.862
tell us all about it?

18:46.647 --> 18:47.387
That's what I thought.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.432
You really screwed me.

18:49.476 --> 18:50.912
That wasn't my intention.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.349
But you can yell at me
all the way back to the station.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.177
Have a nice day, citizens.

18:55.221 --> 18:59.834
After we're gone, wait five
minutes, then let them go.

19:01.792 --> 19:05.840
Hi.
I'm Simone Clark.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.842
Friendly.
They're busy.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.322
Pull up a terminal.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.151
We need any tips relating to
a man with a Russian accent.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.327
There's no telling how long
he's been planning this,

19:14.370 --> 19:15.980
so go back
at least a year.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.460
Yes, ma'am.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.289
Whoa!
That's a lot.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.856
The key is
to keep organized.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.293
I assign a system of letters
and numbers to separate the tips

19:24.337 --> 19:26.165
based on the details
of the call,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.123
then I apply a color scale
rating to each tip

19:28.167 --> 19:29.733
as it's corroborated
or challenged

19:29.777 --> 19:31.300
by other tips
of similar reliability.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.563
That's really
how your brain works?

19:33.607 --> 19:35.217
You'll get it.
Just takes a minute.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.785
And that's what
all these people are doing?

19:37.828 --> 19:39.656
Running searches
on various databases?

19:39.700 --> 19:41.310
They didn't cover this
in Quantico?

19:41.354 --> 19:44.139
It's different when you actually
see it on its feet.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.142
Your system is impressive
and useful, I'm sure.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.144
Maybe not the best
for <i>my</i> skills.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.233
I'm more of
a people person.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.105
You <i>were</i> a people person.
Now you're an FBI agent.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.716
And this is
how we solve cases.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.152
But that doesn't
make any sense.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.762
Shouldn't they encourage us
to use

19:58.806 --> 20:00.808
our innate interests
and abilities

20:00.851 --> 20:03.724
instead of trying to force
everybody into the same mold?

20:03.767 --> 20:05.116
The Bureau doesn't think
like that.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.509
Well, they should.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.164
Hell, if I could change my life
at this age,

20:09.208 --> 20:11.253
the Bureau could change
some things, too.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.559
You sound like Garza.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.257
Really? The boss wants to
shake things up?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.651
I shouldn't have
said anything.
Spill it.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.436
He's talking about
trying to launch a new unit,

20:20.480 --> 20:24.353
one that spends more time
on the street and less in here.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.441
Ding, ding. Okay.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.356
- Sign me up.
- Slow your roll, trainee.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.140
Let's focus on
the task at hand.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.535
Right. Yes.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.972
But I need to go
to the bathroom.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.324
<i>Unless</i> I need to get approval
for that in triplicate.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.327
Only for number two.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.068
Down the hall
on the right.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.594
Excuse me.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.030
Is there
a Lost and Found here?

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
Thank you.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.297
Miss Clark.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.344
Hey, Zeke.
How they treating you?

20:58.387 --> 21:00.346
Better than I deserve.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.478
You talk to that lawyer
my daddy got for you?

21:02.522 --> 21:04.219
Yeah.
She seems nice.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.918
I got you something. Boom.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.921
I know how the headphones help
with your sensory issues.

21:10.965 --> 21:14.316
Now, it's not the unlimited
playlist you're used to,

21:14.360 --> 21:16.710
but hopefully
it'll do the trick

21:16.753 --> 21:18.494
until I can get you
something better.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.890
Thank you.

21:22.933 --> 21:26.285
We a long way from
Claybourne High School, huh?

21:26.328 --> 21:29.026
I heard the agents talking.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.680
They said there was
an explosion.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.336
With the detonators
I made?

21:34.380 --> 21:36.251
Mm-hmm.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.296
How many people
were killed?

21:37.339 --> 21:39.515
17.
Ugh.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.561
And twice that
in the hospital.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.564
Oh, God.
I just want to die.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.306
But you're gonna live.
Pick your head up.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.441
Even incarcerated,
you can still do some good.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.269
You got a big debt
on you now,

21:54.313 --> 21:56.053
one you'll never be
able to pay back,

21:56.097 --> 21:58.360
but you can spend the rest
of your life trying.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.060
Did they catch
that Russian yet?

22:03.104 --> 22:05.846
No. And that's what
I need your help with.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.282
I already told you
all I know.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.457
No, you didn't.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.851
You told me what you thought
was important.

22:10.894 --> 22:14.811
Let me be the judge of that.
Close your eyes.

22:14.855 --> 22:18.206
Come on.
Now I need you to think.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.600
Think about every moment
you spent with this man,

22:20.643 --> 22:22.819
from the first time you saw him
to the last.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.995
Is there anything
that stands out?

22:25.039 --> 22:27.215
A-A behavior, actions?

22:27.258 --> 22:28.303
No.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.044
But...?

22:30.087 --> 22:32.742
He reminded me a little
of Coach Taylor.

22:32.786 --> 22:35.528
300 pounds with --

22:35.571 --> 22:38.531
with a Boston accent so thick,
you could smell the chowder?

22:38.574 --> 22:40.750
Nah. Do you remember
those energy bars

22:40.794 --> 22:42.230
Coach was eating
all the time?

22:42.273 --> 22:45.407
Ooh, always smacking
with his mouth open

22:45.451 --> 22:47.366
like he ain't had
no damn home training.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.411
Yeah, well, the Russian guy
ate the same way.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.152
Same bar?
No.

22:51.195 --> 22:54.198
The label was in Russian
and had a weird design on it.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.200
And it smelled bad.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.986
Shoot.
Fox is looking for me.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.423
I gotta go, baby,
but if I can get them

23:01.467 --> 23:03.033
to bring you some paper,

23:03.077 --> 23:04.557
you think you could draw me
a picture of it?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.804
Find somewhere else
to be.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.764
What?
Things are about
to get hot.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.946
I just saw the bomber
from the news.

23:45.989 --> 23:49.123
Parked a red car
off an alley on 7th.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.080
Walked away.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.387
Hurry.

24:04.573 --> 24:08.272
Victoria: <i>Okay, detectives,</i> <i>
so, Becky here</i>

24:08.316 --> 24:10.449
<i>was able to sweep every part</i> <i>
of the vehicle</i>

24:10.492 --> 24:12.407
<i>for explosives,</i> <i>
except the inside.</i>

24:12.451 --> 24:14.627
That honor is mine.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.605
No trip wires visible.

24:41.654 --> 24:44.613
<i>I'm lifting the driver's side</i> <i>
door now.</i>

25:01.456 --> 25:03.458
<i>We're clear!</i>

25:04.590 --> 25:06.417
Hey, ladies.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.682
My favorite detectives fighting
crime and looking good doing it.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.685
Bomb squad just cleared the car.
- No explosives.
- I'm jealous.

25:12.728 --> 25:13.903
You guys are watching
"Hurt Locker"

25:13.947 --> 25:16.079
and I'm reading
about paranoid shut-ins

25:16.123 --> 25:17.907
who think Russian spies
are their neighbors.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.648
What?

25:21.955 --> 25:24.523
It's not up to us which aspect
of our investigation

25:24.566 --> 25:26.220
we share with local law.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.352
What did I share?
It's not classified intel.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.138
We're working a tip line.
Why wouldn't I share that?

25:31.181 --> 25:32.705
Because it's FBI policy.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.359
Hey, guys,
you need to hear this.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.797
The 911 call of the guy
who called in the car.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.103
Ilya: <i>I just saw the bomber</i> <i>
from the news.</i>

25:40.147 --> 25:41.844
<i>Parked a red car</i> <i>
off an alley on 7th.</i>

25:41.888 --> 25:44.673
<i>Walked away.</i> <i>
Hurry.</i>

25:44.717 --> 25:47.371
That's got to be him.
He wanted us to find the car.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.199
Which would make sense
if he booby-trapped the car

25:49.243 --> 25:52.115
to blow us up, but w-why call
it in if he <i>wasn't</i> doing that?

25:52.159 --> 25:53.203
Victoria: Detectives.

25:56.903 --> 25:57.991
Detectives.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.862
Our suspect left you
a little something

25:59.906 --> 26:01.124
on the steering column.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.043
That's weird.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.045
- That's weird, right?
- Yeah, very.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.612
Here, get this
into the office.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.353
I'll call the lab and get them
to put a rush on it.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.183
<i>Look, I'm sorry</i> <i>
how today went down.</i>

26:16.226 --> 26:17.880
<i>Oh, which helps me</i> <i>
not at all.</i>

26:17.924 --> 26:19.665
And you are crazy if you think
I'm gonna reveal

26:19.708 --> 26:21.449
classified intel
in a police station

26:21.492 --> 26:23.059
where the whole world
is listening.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.453
Okay, you are in this mess
because your Agency

26:25.496 --> 26:27.455
would rather guard
their precious little secrets

26:27.498 --> 26:29.500
than help us bring a terrorist
to justice.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.633
So if you know something that
might help us catch this guy

26:31.677 --> 26:33.635
and you refuse to share it,
I'll arrest you

26:33.679 --> 26:36.420
for accessory after the fact
to terrorism.

26:36.464 --> 26:37.857
Your friend sucks.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.467
Oh, I'm just getting
warmed up.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.252
The CIA isn't
taking you back.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.037
Yeah.
Not what you want to hear,

26:44.080 --> 26:45.865
I know,
but it's the reality.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.171
So you have got a choice
to make --

26:48.215 --> 26:51.435
the right one...
or the wrong one.

26:51.479 --> 26:55.178
Look, dozens are dead, but the
goal was hundreds, thousands.

26:55.222 --> 26:58.660
Now, I know you joined the
Agency to protect this country,

26:58.704 --> 27:01.445
so it's time to step up
and do it.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.533
What's Enervo?

27:02.577 --> 27:05.058
- It's an answer.
- To what question?

27:05.101 --> 27:08.714
How can the CIA destabilize
a foreign city

27:08.757 --> 27:10.498
without ever firing a shot?

27:10.541 --> 27:13.109
Enervo was a black op

27:13.153 --> 27:15.285
where foreign assets were
recruited and trained

27:15.329 --> 27:17.505
to create chaos
in their home countries.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.246
So the CIA could keep their
fingerprints off of it all.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.900
Who authorized
this operation?

27:20.943 --> 27:22.292
- I don't know.
- You're lying!

27:22.336 --> 27:23.685
Why would I at this point?

27:23.729 --> 27:26.253
I have no idea
who ran the program.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.516
Rumor is it was never
officially sanctioned.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.344
You recognize him?

27:30.387 --> 27:33.260
Yes. Ilya Sokurov.

27:33.303 --> 27:34.348
He was a foreign asset.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.828
I heard he was recruited
for Enervo.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.526
But the Russians captured him
in 2018,

27:38.569 --> 27:41.007
accused him of being a spy,
and sent him to a penal colony.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.225
Where the CIA
abandoned him.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.706
It's SOP.
Sokurov knew the risks.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.839
But apparently
he escaped.

27:46.882 --> 27:49.711
And now he's using what <i>
we</i> taught him against us.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.193
Hey, any update?

27:53.236 --> 27:55.064
Not yet.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.458
Same as when you last asked --
five minutes ago.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.242
You would think that someone
would come up with

27:59.286 --> 28:01.462
a faster way
to get DNA results.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.290
Well, maybe you can
go do that.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.728
There you are.
Prisoner in holding

28:06.772 --> 28:07.773
wanted me
to give you this.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.733
Good man, Zeke.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.301
Anyone in this building
a Russia expert?

28:14.344 --> 28:15.824
I mean, not like
Russia Russia,

28:15.868 --> 28:18.609
but where somebody might go
to buy a weird energy bar?

28:18.653 --> 28:21.612
Mm, I doubt it.
But you can take it to CID.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.179
They can source
the manufacturer,

28:23.223 --> 28:24.615
chase down
the distributor network,

28:24.659 --> 28:26.052
come up with
a list of stores.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.706
Probably get an answer
in a couple days.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.709
I don't <i>have</i>
a couple of days.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.884
I'm gonna call my father.

28:31.927 --> 28:34.060
He used to play jazz
with some Russians,

28:34.103 --> 28:37.803
and I bet you
he still keeps in touch.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.413
<i>This is Cutty.</i> <i>
Leave a message.</i>

28:39.456 --> 28:42.546
Ugh!
Why do I even bother?!

28:42.590 --> 28:44.331
This man never
answers his phone.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.506
What's the good
in having a cellphone

28:45.549 --> 28:46.986
if he never answers?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.552
This really sounds
like a conversation

28:48.596 --> 28:49.597
you should have with him.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.642
Boom. I'm going to.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.992
Call Fox
with the results.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.167
Will do.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.429
Cutty: Uh, Mrs. Franklin.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.779
Yes, this is Cutty.
I have some good news.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.434
I've tracked down Jace.
Ah, he's fine.

29:00.477 --> 29:03.567
His work evacuated
after the explosion.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.395
He left his phone behind.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.702
It's my pleasure.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.964
Let me know if
I can do anything for you.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.574
Bye.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.925
So this is why you're not
returning my calls.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.361
I'm kind of busy.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.929
We're helping the families
that lost people today.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.626
James:
Wilkins is on board.

29:18.669 --> 29:23.152
He's going to get food donations
from all the local restaurants.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.938
Simone Clark.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.591
James Murray.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.332
Met your new bride
over at the station.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.769
You work fast.

29:30.812 --> 29:33.423
Hey, when you know,
you know.

29:33.467 --> 29:37.079
Wesley, this is Cutty's daughter
Simone, my first crush.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.907
She was a few grades
ahead of me at school,

29:38.951 --> 29:41.736
and I was heartbroken
when she went away to college.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.826
That's me, a trail of broken
hearts in my wake.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.436
Well, it's good
to meet you.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.829
I heard you're working
the bombing case.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.831
I am, which is the reason
why I stopped by.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.007
Daddy,
do you still play chess

29:52.051 --> 29:54.401
with your Russian jazz buddies
in the park?

29:54.444 --> 29:55.489
The Redfellas?
Uh-huh.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.447
I haven't missed a game
in 10 years.

29:57.491 --> 30:00.973
Do you think one of them could
translate this for me?

30:01.016 --> 30:03.584
It's some sort of
a Russian energy bar,

30:03.627 --> 30:04.759
but I've been looking it up online

30:04.803 --> 30:06.152
and can't find it anywhere.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.370
That's 'cause
you spelled it wrong.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.155
- You speak Russian?
- Know a little.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.592
But I've seen a bunch of
these candy wrappers.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.377
My buddy Pavel, well,
he loves these.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.858
Krovfeta.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.513
And it's not
an energy bar.

30:19.556 --> 30:23.822
It's a Soviet-era candy bar
made with cow's blood.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.215
- Okay, that's nasty.
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.259 --> 30:29.218
Uh, but where would one buy
this Soviet blood candy?

30:29.262 --> 30:32.918
Only place I can think is...
over by the Aquarium.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.137
There's a Russian deli there.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.574
Okay.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.012
Boom! Found it.
Thank you.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.665
Wait, wait, wait,
hold up.

30:41.709 --> 30:45.365
You promised me that you would
stay inside where it's safe.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.193
I did no such thing.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.760
But if it'll make you feel
better, I'll call backup.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.328
Hey, what's up?

30:52.372 --> 30:54.765
See how he <i>answers</i> his phone
when I call?

30:54.809 --> 30:56.855
John, you ever had
a pierogi?

30:56.898 --> 30:58.552
I've never had them. <i>Me either.</i>

30:58.595 --> 30:59.901
But why don't you meet me

30:59.945 --> 31:02.295
over at the Russian deli
near the Aquarium?

31:02.338 --> 31:03.818
We're gonna follow up
on a lead.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.907
What kind of lead? <i>It's a long shot,</i>

31:05.951 --> 31:08.605
but the good news is
you can buy me dinner.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.099
Nolan: <i>
I'm three minutes away.</i>

31:24.143 --> 31:25.709
He's here.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.886
I'm in the car outside the deli,
and he's walking towards me.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.496
Okay, stay in your car.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.932
We'll lose him.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.934
You're still a trainee.
You don't have a weapon.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.109
Stay in your car.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.241
I can't.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.156
Simone!

31:43.249 --> 31:45.033
Excuse me.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.427
My boyfriend --
Okay, that's a lie.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.907
He's not my boyfriend --

31:48.950 --> 31:50.996
just this cute guy named John
that I've been seeing --

31:51.039 --> 31:53.172
asked me to meet him
at the Aquarium,

31:53.215 --> 31:55.609
and then I got turned around
'cause I dropped my phone

31:55.652 --> 31:57.045
and now everything's
in German.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.439
And I don't speak German, so...

31:59.482 --> 32:02.007
Hell, you looking at me like
I don't speak English.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.922
Move.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.967
Is that how you talk
to a lady?

32:06.011 --> 32:08.143
I know your mama raised you
better than that.

32:08.187 --> 32:11.059
All I'm asking you to do is tell
me which way the Aquarium is.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.713
Hey!

32:34.604 --> 32:37.390
- You okay?
- No.

32:37.433 --> 32:38.913
Embarrassed he got
on top of me so fast.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.307
- See which way he went?
- That way.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.786
7-Adam-15.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.963
Bombing suspect last seen
heading south on Chestnut

32:45.006 --> 32:46.007
towards the Aquarium.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.009
Go, go, go!

32:49.271 --> 32:50.794
Oh, shoot.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.883
I think I'm in trouble.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.668
Hey, I was just getting ready
to call you.

32:54.711 --> 32:55.843
Where the hell are you?

32:55.886 --> 32:57.105
You were supposed to
hang with the DNA.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.324
Anders said
you ran out of there

32:58.367 --> 33:00.152
talking about
Russian candy bars.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.980
What had happened was

33:02.023 --> 33:03.982
I went back down
to see Zeke earlier

33:04.025 --> 33:05.853
when I told you
I was going to the bathroom,

33:05.896 --> 33:07.159
and he remembered something.

33:07.202 --> 33:09.509
Long story short,
I found Ilya and I lost him.

33:09.552 --> 33:12.164
But I'm with Nolan now,
and we're on the hunt.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.775
We're gonna have
a long conversation about this

33:14.818 --> 33:16.777
- when this is over.
- Looking forward to it,

33:16.820 --> 33:19.954
but right now, we gotta
run down a terrorist.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.434
Tell me.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.740
Colin: <i>Cops have a possible</i> <i>
location on Ilya.</i>

33:23.784 --> 33:26.221
Near the Aquarium.
We're heading there now.
What do you want us to do?

33:26.265 --> 33:28.049
Get there first
and put him down.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.399
It could get messy.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.835
Messy I can clean.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.185
If Ilya isn't dead
before the cops get there,

33:33.228 --> 33:34.273
we're all
going to prison.

33:34.316 --> 33:37.102
I expect you're here
to apologize.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.104
- For what?
- For what?

33:39.147 --> 33:40.931
Interfering
with company business,

33:40.975 --> 33:42.411
abducting a case officer.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.934
I want Kate Hill back,
by the way.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.067
Kate Hill? She's the least
of your problems.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.287
We found a hairbrush
in Ilya Sokurov's car --

33:48.330 --> 33:50.506
the car he directed us to
by calling 911.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.509
We ran the hair for DNA.
And it was yours.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.555
Sgt. Grey: Only question is <i>
why</i> was it yours?

33:55.598 --> 33:57.078
What's your relationship
with Ilya?

33:57.122 --> 33:58.645
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:58.688 --> 34:01.474
I think you do. In fact, I think
you're Ilya's real target.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.606
I mean, why else would he plant
your DNA in his car?

34:03.650 --> 34:06.087
To hang himself
around your neck

34:06.131 --> 34:08.611
because he blames you
for something.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.570
Which means you lied to us earlier.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.355
You know exactly who he is
'cause he used to work for you.

34:13.399 --> 34:16.750
You ran Enervo
as an unsanctioned operation,

34:16.793 --> 34:18.795
'cause why else would you be
so desperate to hide it?

34:18.839 --> 34:21.276
We're done.
I'm late for dinner.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.497
You're missing dinner.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.564
Suspect's going into
the Aquarium.

34:48.608 --> 34:49.783
<i>We're in foot pursuit.</i>

34:49.826 --> 34:51.698
Game faces on, gentlemen.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.830
We're one minute out.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.146
I assume you're
handgun-qualified.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.843
Yeah.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.169
This place is creepy
at night.

35:28.213 --> 35:31.041
Feels like these fish got
something against me.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.174
Like they know something
they're not telling me.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.785
<i>It's not the fish</i> <i>
I'm worried about.</i>

35:35.829 --> 35:38.179
Is it the mass-murdering
terrorist?

35:38.223 --> 35:40.007
Yep.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.178
Nolan:
Show me your hands.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.570
It's over.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.050
That's right, it is.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.706
So show me
your damn hands.

36:28.925 --> 36:31.928
I need you
to hear my story,

36:31.972 --> 36:36.759
so that when they kill me,
it won't die with me.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.327
And I need to
put cuffs on you.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.503
So put your hands
on your head,

36:41.547 --> 36:42.548
nice and slow.

36:52.993 --> 36:57.476
Does your story include
why you planted a man's
hairbrush in your car?

36:57.519 --> 36:59.042
He's not a man.

36:59.086 --> 37:02.263
He's a monster.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.439
And he promised
he would take care of them

37:04.483 --> 37:05.788
if anything happened to me.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.835
Take care of who?

37:08.878 --> 37:12.621
My wife.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.493
My li--

37:16.843 --> 37:18.366
My little girls.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.543
But when I was arrested,

37:21.587 --> 37:25.025
Bill August walked away.

37:25.068 --> 37:27.767
He shut down
the Enervo program,

37:27.810 --> 37:29.856
and he left them.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.948
To be rounded up
and killed.

37:34.991 --> 37:36.341
I feel for you.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.560
But that doesn't make
what you did right.

37:38.604 --> 37:41.520
All those people you killed --
they have families, too.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.523
It was necessary.

37:44.566 --> 37:47.743
After what he did to me --

37:47.787 --> 37:50.746
the innocents he destroyed?

37:50.790 --> 37:53.183
I had to tear him down.

37:53.227 --> 37:56.578
Burn everything he built.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.232
Killing him
wouldn't have done that.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.801
We need to move, now.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.071
Nolan: Get down!

38:11.114 --> 38:13.073
Simone: We are seriously
outgunned!

38:15.293 --> 38:16.598
Simone.

38:33.485 --> 38:34.486
Over there, over there.

38:58.031 --> 39:00.381
Tim: Hands up!

39:03.428 --> 39:06.300
Drop the gun!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.997
- Do it now!
- Get up! Drop it!

39:08.041 --> 39:09.695
Get up! Hands in the air!
Turn around!

39:18.268 --> 39:20.053
I'm gonna need
those cuffs back.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.145
Let me guess.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.408
Don't tell me I need to do
some more exercise.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.019
That's just basic science,
but what do you say, uh,

39:30.063 --> 39:31.673
maybe we get drunk
first?

39:31.717 --> 39:34.328
Now you're talkin'.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.289
You are the worst
new Agent trainee

39:39.333 --> 39:41.074
in the history
of the Bureau.

39:41.117 --> 39:42.380
Yes, sir.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.990
You're unconventional,
you're stubborn,

39:44.033 --> 39:45.426
and you -- you -- you --
you possess a --

39:45.470 --> 39:48.560
an almost pathological inability
to follow protocol.

39:48.603 --> 39:53.129
Yes, sir. But I did help
catch a terrorist,

39:53.173 --> 39:56.916
a rogue CIA agent, <i>
and</i> his evil-ass hit squad,

39:56.959 --> 40:00.398
so it should kind of
balance itself out, right?

40:00.441 --> 40:01.399
This time.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.009
Thank you, sir.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.793
And it was an honor
to work for you.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.839
I'll be keeping tabs

40:06.882 --> 40:08.014
I mean, I'm not gonna put
my thumb on the scale

40:08.057 --> 40:10.233

but if you do manage

40:10.277 --> 40:11.452
to make it through,
who knows?

40:11.496 --> 40:12.975
Maybe you'll come
