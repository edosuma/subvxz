WEBVTT

00:02.752 --> 00:03.670
Previously on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:05.213 --> 00:07.173
Out of all the crew,
there’s only one person

00:07.215 --> 00:08.550
I don’t get along with,
and that happens to be you.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.343
You’ve had a problem with
me from the beginning!

00:10.385 --> 00:12.220
You stepped on and
started nit picking.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.596
Stop putting your hand
in my face!

00:13.638 --> 00:15.306
Let me finish.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.434
If you’re going to do this, then
I’m going to do this, to you.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.815
Wow, I want to trust her.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.151
I think it’s the tequila.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.448
I don’t understand
how that’s possible.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.033
Mm-hmm.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.368
Natalya’s being very stable
since the reset on the interior,

00:35.410 --> 00:37.871
but she’s not above regression.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.330
That’s really high up.

00:40.498 --> 00:43.293
We don’t have time to
----ing sit around and wank.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.212
I want to kick Max in the dick.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.213
We’re not lazy on this boat.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.214
No, we’re not lazy.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.591
I know it’s irritating.

00:49.632 --> 00:50.884
Well...

00:50.925 --> 00:51.926
Maybe we could feed
the guy with compliments.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.094
Really?

00:53.136 --> 00:55.472
Max doesn’t like being told off.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.098
Maybe we try
the opposite of that.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.224
I don’t know.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.809
Max, you’re doing ----ing great.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.894
Thank you, Lara.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.771
There we go.
Some positivity.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.067
Luka, like, I do
want to kiss him.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.318
I’m in an open relationship,

01:08.360 --> 01:10.111
but my boyfriend
said I don’t want

01:10.153 --> 01:11.071
to influence your night off.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.447
Do what you need to do.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.074
I would just hope that
it doesn’t hurt me.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.742
I thought you were just in bed.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.369
Who’s the bunch of people?

01:20.955 --> 01:23.708
Oh, my God.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.293
Pressuring me about Luka

01:25.335 --> 01:26.753
and like, having a free-for-all
where you get to go to Thailand.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.922
He can do what he wants,
but you can’t do what you want.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.674
I don’t know about that.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.133
Luka, come over here.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.638
[kissing]

01:38.807 --> 01:40.767
Nat, answer it.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.893
No, don’t answer it.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.269
No, it’s not going to be good.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.069
-He’s calling me.
-Go for it.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.487
No, it’s not going to be good.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.155
Go for it.
It’s going to be funny.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.616
No, it’s actually not funny.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.826
This is my ----ing life.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.285
Okay, I’ll leave.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.830
I’m so confused
about what’s happening.

02:01.871 --> 02:02.997
I can’t get laid.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.333
Sweet dreams.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.129
[bleep] me,
I want to go home.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.840
It’s too far,
what I’ve already done.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.967
We have to do this together.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.677
You miss A.J., I miss Zachary.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.678
Please don’t leave me.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.192
Oh!

02:33.611 --> 02:35.363
Oh!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.159
Interior, interior, Tumi.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.703
Morning.
How are you doing?

02:43.288 --> 02:45.165
Please can we make
sure cabins are done.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.125
-Copy, on my way.
-I don’t care anymore.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.169
If the boat burns down,
then I’m going with it.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.670
That’s great.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.048
Oops.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.382
I’m an emotional wreck.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.717
And I just don’t know
what is happening.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.763
You know, if I’m being honest,

02:59.804 --> 03:01.014
I’ve come to a realization

03:01.056 --> 03:02.432
I don’t want an open
relationship.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.892
I don’t know what I expected.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.310
Not to be feeling like sh--.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.895
I think we should have not
been with anyone else.

03:06.936 --> 03:11.358
But the fact that he is, then I
guess I should be able to then.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.693
But he’s told me
he’s not okay with it.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.369
Now, this other persons
come along,

03:22.410 --> 03:25.080
but in my heart,
I do love my boyfriend.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.748
I feel like I have to push away.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.166
Love is crap.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.668
-Oi.
-You made this for me.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.045
I’m going to keep it to a
bare minimum with you today.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.213
I’m just going to say hi, bye.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.714
I’m not even going
to talk to you.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
Okay, thank you.

03:35.799 --> 03:39.219
[Max vocalizing]

03:39.260 --> 03:41.888
Just look better when you do it.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.056
Morning.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.891
Oh, that bed
looks amaze-balls.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.559
Oh, yay, thanks.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.311
So good.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.480
How many bars has she got?

03:50.522 --> 03:51.773
She needs one more bar.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.316
Jack, Luka, and Tumi

03:53.358 --> 03:55.735
meet me in the crew mess
for preference sheet meeting.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.654
-Copy.
-Copy.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.905
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:58.947 --> 03:59.948
Are we ready for another one?

03:59.989 --> 04:01.241
I think we are.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.826
Amanda Britt owns
an event space

04:02.867 --> 04:04.077
and party planning business

04:04.119 --> 04:05.912
and is looking to
bring her party expertise

04:05.954 --> 04:08.957
to the Ligurian Coast
with her closest girlfriends.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.126
The second night,
she would like

04:11.167 --> 04:13.211
a casino atmosphere
created on the yacht.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.964
She loves espresso martinis,
margaritas.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.007
She’s my kind of girl.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.091
They’re all Florida girls.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.760
-Get ready.
-I’m ready.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.763
Favorite cuisines:
Thai, Mediterranean.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.850
Does not eat any meats
aside from seafood.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.103
Well, she can have
whatever she wants.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.563
Okay, so listen up.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.772
Since they’re all women

04:32.814 --> 04:34.941
and they’re quite young,
maintain your...

04:34.983 --> 04:36.192
Yeah, of course.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.444
Because I’m sure they
will tease you.

04:37.485 --> 04:41.031
You know that line.
Don’t cross it.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.965
-All right.
-I’m excited.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.050
Let’s have some fun tomorrow.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.051
This is going to be a good one.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.344
This is going to be--

05:02.385 --> 05:03.803
Chaos!

05:03.845 --> 05:05.138
I’m throwing this in.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.015
You okay, honey?
How far are you?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.600
I wiped the master.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.934
So you’re pretty much done?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.102
-Yeah.
-Cool.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.145
I’m also, so...

05:12.187 --> 05:13.271
-You feeling okay?
-Yeah.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.814
-You okay?
-Yeah, why?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.107
Yeah, no. I’m just asking.
Nothing bad.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.317
You’re being sus.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.611
I know you had
second stew experience

05:19.652 --> 05:21.404
or your confidence on service.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.322
I’m like...

05:22.364 --> 05:23.740
-What’s...
-No energy.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.616
Mentally.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.992
A lot of exhaustion, you know?

05:26.034 --> 05:28.536
Aw, [bleep] it.
I’m too drained. I don’t care.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.331
Mentally, my mind is
completely in housekeeping,

05:31.373 --> 05:34.334
but I’m happy
to take one for the team.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.336
I’m a go with the flow type
of girl anyway,

05:36.378 --> 05:37.921
so I’m like, all right,
just bring it on.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.174
I just think it’s fair that you
also get to do service too.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.425
-That’s true.
-Yeah.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.177
Lara, do you want
to do those windows?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.345
-On the sides?
-Yeah.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.554
Yeah.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.350
Did you just make a penis?

05:50.392 --> 05:51.559
[laughing]

05:51.601 --> 05:52.936
That’s a little heart.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.062
Oh.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.857
-So good.
-Oh, no.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.193
I hate an all-girl group

06:00.235 --> 06:03.238
because they do cute weird
sh-- that no one likes to do.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.781
Kyle.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.491
I’m not mentally and emotionally
equipped to be on service.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.326
I’m going to housekeeping,
I’ll take over from Jess.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.705
No, they’re going to be fun.
They’re just going to be busy.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.373
Okay.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.875
Kyle has more
experience in service,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.044
and depending on how
crazy these guests are

06:18.086 --> 06:19.421
and what their demands are,

06:19.462 --> 06:22.590
I need Kyle’s energy,
this charter, so...

06:25.260 --> 06:26.261
This is your charter.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.054
What’s your dream job, Lara?

06:28.096 --> 06:29.889
Captain Sandy’s position.

06:29.931 --> 06:30.974
I’d love to be a cappy.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.727
Tell people to [bleep] off.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.978
And you?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.230
I know there’s places like
baby manatees

06:37.272 --> 06:38.481
need someone to hug them

06:38.523 --> 06:40.150
because they’re very
loving creatures

06:40.191 --> 06:41.609
and I think I’d be
good at that.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.903
I did see that
there’s a job opening

06:43.945 --> 06:45.739
where walruses need
love and affection.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.323
I don’t care how much it pays.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.492
I’ll hug walruses all day

06:49.534 --> 06:51.786
and I’ll sell feet pics
to compensate.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.081
-This is hilarious.
-Frenchy cleaned the mat.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.584
He was sweating like a tit,
but he had a good vibe.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.544
Oh, did you realize
if you laid down?

06:59.586 --> 07:00.962
There you are,
you beautiful boy.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.255
Oh, thank you.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.299
If you’re ever put in
a management position,

07:04.341 --> 07:05.967
I think you need your own Max.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.345
If you laid down, how
comfortable is the teak?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.263
That’s the biggest
learning curve

07:10.305 --> 07:11.765
I think I’ve ever been thrown.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.059
-You okay?
-I’m tired, bro.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.770
Can you imagine just spending
10 minutes in Max’s head

07:16.811 --> 07:19.522
just to figure out what
the [bleep] he’s thinking?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.567
It’s literally probably a
cartoon going on in there.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.613
Just random noises, ----ing
sh-- bouncing around.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.115
I don’t know.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.450
It’s really comfortable.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.243
I like my bed more,
to be honest.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
-We’re done here, so...
-Yeah.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.288
-Hey, babe.
-Hi, honey.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.873
-Hi, everyone.
-Hi.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.375
I put stuff in the washing
machine and you aren’t around.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.335
-Don’t hate me.
-It’s okay.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.004
-Hi, girls.
-[phone rings]

07:44.047 --> 07:45.048
Who’s calling you?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.675
Her boyfriend.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.512
Like, I can’t even tell you how
sh-- everything is right now.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.185
-Is he pissed off?
-Yeah.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.937
You were telling me
to get home?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.313
Yeah.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.023
Did you go home with anyone?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.650
This is what you want.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.859
If you said to me tomorrow,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.569
I want to be the
only the rest of my life,

08:06.611 --> 08:08.321
I would be only with you.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.657
I am trying to get
myself in your mindset.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.825
What do you want from me?

08:11.866 --> 08:12.992
Do you want me on
a plane tomorrow

08:13.034 --> 08:15.245
because I will
come home tomorrow.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.830
I’m not doing anything.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.873
You keep acting so mean, I don’t
get what you keep saying.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.166
I’m telling you what happened

08:20.208 --> 08:21.835
because you told me
to be honest with you.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.253
That was it.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.504
You’re acting like I’m about
to go and ----ing

08:24.546 --> 08:26.673
move away with this person.
Like...

08:28.049 --> 08:30.301
I don’t know what to do.
Talk to you later.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.307
I’ll speak to you
in a few hours.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.643
A.J.’s not being
nice to her.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.061
It’s because of Luka.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.108
Yeah, what the [bleep]?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.234
Is that what you said?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.570
-Christ!
-No!

08:51.906 --> 08:52.741
[bleep]!

08:52.782 --> 08:56.244
-It’s all girls.
-No way.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.328
Yeah, they’re young.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.330
Some are really pretty.
Whoa!

09:01.750 --> 09:03.293
Why not?

09:03.335 --> 09:04.419
Yeah!

09:04.461 --> 09:05.712
What’s wrong with him?
Is he upset?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.213
No, he’s fine.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.382
I was just on the phone to him,
but the reception is crap.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.884
Should we talk about
how Tumi and Jess

09:10.925 --> 09:13.386
are going to
run service this charter?

09:13.428 --> 09:15.055
Can I get a yes?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.556
[laughing]

09:16.598 --> 09:18.433
Okay.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.809
I’m confused.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.561
Are we really switching
positions this next charter?

09:21.603 --> 09:24.105
Oh, no, I was just joking.
That’s up to Tumi.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.358
Kyle is so shady.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.401
He’s trying to put me in
the spot in front of Jess

09:28.443 --> 09:29.778
so that he can
get out of service.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.321
And it’s annoying.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.947
Less than two hours ago, we
literally had a conversation

09:32.989 --> 09:34.908
about him being on
service this charter.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.743
I’m not mentally and
emotionally equipped

09:36.785 --> 09:38.078
to be on service.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.412
So ha ha ha, cute.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.622
Try again next week.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.207
You are the service queen.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.584
I don’t know who gave me
that title, but it wasn’t me.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.795
You gave yourself
the goddamn title.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.296
No girl.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.714
Coming up...

09:49.756 --> 09:52.175
Maybe like a bit of downforce
on the tail when we...

09:52.217 --> 09:54.219
Yes, exact...

09:55.136 --> 09:56.262
Oh, sh--.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.555
I’m ----ing sh---ing myself.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.016
----ing Broke
Captain Sandy’s wrist.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.108
How are we, my love?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.192
We’re fine.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.652
-I’m too bad.
-Okay.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.029
What the...

10:13.071 --> 10:14.072
Agh!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.866
-What is that?
-I’m so confused.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.159
Who made a ----ing sandwich?

10:18.201 --> 10:22.205
I always get bologna
sandwich in the laundry.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.961
-Where are you?
-Here.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.839
[yawns]

10:33.591 --> 10:34.759
This charter seems like it’s
going to be

10:34.801 --> 10:36.177
such a ball breaker.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.679
Yeah, you’re right.

10:37.721 --> 10:38.722
Like, [bleep] that.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.056
Kyle wanted you to go on
service.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.183
-I know. I don’t...
-I didn’t get it.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.935
He told me that.
And I was like, wait, what?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.353
He doesn’t want
to be on service.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.355
Obvious.
It’s very obvious.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.565
Like, now I’m just like, okay,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.859
it looks like I’m not
on service.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.779
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.034
What the heck?
That’s so rude.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.827
Should we talk about
how Tumi and Jess

11:00.869 --> 11:02.412
are going to run
service this time?

11:02.454 --> 11:05.248
-No!
-[laughing]

11:05.290 --> 11:07.042
At first, I was confused,

11:07.083 --> 11:10.420
but now Natalya makes me
feel like Tumi

11:10.462 --> 11:13.381
doesn’t think that
I’m capable to be on service.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.675
So I feel stupid right now.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.926
It’s like, damn.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.428
You could be chief stew.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.180
I mean, don’t doubt yourself.
You’re ----ing amazing.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.475
That’s weird, though.
Don’t belittle me.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.560
Yeah.
Let’s go to bed.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.561
Yeah, that’s a lot.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.937
We’ll see how
this trip goes.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.105
It just feels out of character

11:29.147 --> 11:31.232
that Tumi is talking
sh-- about me.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.569
So I’m just a little confused
as to what switched.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.737
You’re going to go
to bed, honey?

11:35.779 --> 11:37.072
I’m going to try.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.407
I’m off duty, emotionally,
and work-wise.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.326
I don’t blame you.
Love you.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.244
-You too.
-Sleep tight.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.292
[alarm beeps]

11:50.502 --> 11:51.461
Morning, bro.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.382
Thank you.
Just kick me. I don’t mind.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.801
Ready to seize the goddamn day?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.349
What’s up, mother----er?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.892
Shrimpies give them
that wow factor.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.268
Gonna wow them.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.271
I’m making a table, navy,
and white for seafood.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.107
I want to talk to
you about something.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.067
What’s up?

12:14.109 --> 12:15.985
Look at him go with a polish.

12:16.027 --> 12:16.986
Yeah.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.948
-Hey, French.
-Hey, you.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.659
Hey, you.
African.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.536
Yesterday, what was
that whole thing like,

12:24.577 --> 12:27.622
you’re going to be on
service, and then she laughs.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.041
Am I being belittled?
Am I crazy?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.043
No. And I want you to
know you’re not alone.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.294
I just think it’s fair.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.130
Everyone gets a fair
chance with everything.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.673
-Dude, I love housekeeping.
-Yeah.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.966
You know?

12:38.008 --> 12:39.801
I love wherever the [bleep]
I am, honestly.

12:39.843 --> 12:40.885
But you want to do service, too.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.137
-That’s true.
-Yeah.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.930
Keep a smile on your face.
I’m here.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.141
I have-- Holy [bleep]!

12:46.182 --> 12:48.518
You walked right into it,
didn’t you?

12:49.519 --> 12:50.979
All crew, all crew, all crew.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.939
We got provisions
behind the boats.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.524
-Copy.
-Grazi.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.817
Where do you want
dry store goods?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.068
Anywhere around here.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.820
-Teamwork makes the dream work.
-Slippery.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.155
Oh, look at those, mate.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.531
These bad boys.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.490
Chips.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.659
-Bon giorno.
-Bon giorno.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.994
-You got it?
-Ooh, yum.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.412
-Yes.
-Nice work.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.663
Oh, wow.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.706
How did this happen?

13:09.748 --> 13:10.915
Hello.

13:10.957 --> 13:11.916
How are you?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.251
Great. How are you?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.212
I can definitely see that this

13:16.254 --> 13:18.173
is affecting Natalya
quite a lot.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.884
In this situation, I’m just
going to respect her boundaries.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.385
She says that this is
the love of her life.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.429
I’m not going to get
in the way of that.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.139
Drama.

13:26.181 --> 13:30.143
What did the buffalo say to his
son when he went to college?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.853
Bye, son.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.480
Oh, my God.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.648
I know.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.275
Here’s more.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.385
I don’t think Tumi realizes who
was running this show

14:03.426 --> 14:04.719
before she got there.

14:04.761 --> 14:05.887
It was me and Jess.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.014
Jess is a good second stew.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.891
I would be happy if I had a team

14:09.933 --> 14:10.892
and one of the guys was like,

14:10.934 --> 14:12.102
oh, can I please
go on a service?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.520
Abso-----ing-lutely
you can.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.938
Please.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.398
I’m just bothered that I
can’t confront her really

14:16.439 --> 14:18.942
because I’m trying
to keep the peace.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.987
Jessika, how’s it going,
sugar lumps?

14:23.029 --> 14:26.116
-Eh.
-Thank you, my darling.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.626
This has to be pointed this way.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.669
Okay.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.212
What about putting it in there?

14:39.254 --> 14:40.755
-Hey, honey.
-Shut up.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.756
Excuse me?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.633
I wasn’t talking to you.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.926
This looks beautiful.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.261
-That’s it.
-We’re done?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.263
-Yeah.
-Yes, we’re done.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.224
I’m gonna see how today goes.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.352
Perfect.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.231
Okay, we gotta get changed.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.775
All crew, all crew.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.902
To the dock now
for guest arrival.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.487
All crew, all crew,
you guys suck.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.781
I really need a wee, but I
guess I’ll just hold that in.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.491
Get a bladder infection.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.496
Okay, let’s go to the dock.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.544
Jeesh.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.420
Oh, my God.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.756
-Hey, guys.
-This is fun.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.798
I love this.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.093
The sun came out for you.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.303
So nice to meet you, Amanda.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.305
-Hi, Delaney.
-Hello, my name is Max.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.015
-Nice to meet you.
-I’m Jack. Nice to meet you.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.433
-I’m Leni.
-So happy to have you.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.310
I can’t cross the line.
I can’t cross the line.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.270
I can’t cross the line.
I can’t cross the line.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.814
So, Tumi’s our Chief Stew.
She’s gonna show you around.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.524
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.241
Whoa.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.493
All right, we’ll get that
luggage on and then get changed.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.204
So we have tequila shots
and we got champagne.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.206
-Thank you so much.
-Woo!

15:56.247 --> 15:58.958
These girls are gonna have
a lug-gage.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.377
Woo!

16:00.418 --> 16:02.045
We’ll just wait till they
get off the aft deck.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.173
Let’s stop.
This is your main deck salon.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.550
This is where
the Casino Night will happen.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.303
Yes!

16:11.554 --> 16:13.598
-I think I’m going to propose.
-Whoa.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.934
This is the master.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
[shouting]

16:18.019 --> 16:19.604
-Are you kidding?
-Dope!

16:19.646 --> 16:20.855
This is for royalty.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.524
Let me take you up.

16:22.565 --> 16:23.942
So many stairs.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.985
I mean, I’m literally working
out.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.195
There we go.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.655
Do you guys want
more champagne?

16:28.697 --> 16:29.864
Always.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.116
Can I get an Aperol spritz,

16:31.157 --> 16:32.158
but can you
splash some gin in there?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.035
-Sure.
-Thank you.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.870
Luka, can you please
help me with this thing?

16:35.912 --> 16:36.913
Now you want my help.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.331
Okay.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.423
Tumi, like,
[laughs]

16:50.468 --> 16:52.303
Even though I’m trying
to keep my distance from Luka,

16:52.345 --> 16:53.680
he’s still the person that
I confide in

16:53.722 --> 16:55.265
at the end of the day.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.934
The only difference is, I might
have to put on a chastity belt.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.978
Sassy.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.896
Deck crew, deck crew.
Prepare for departure.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.189
Copy.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.482
Is there a bathroom
on this floor, too?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.026
There is.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.193
So just behind this door,
there’s a little door in there.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.653
-Okay.
-There should be a bathroom.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.822
Deck crew, deck crew.
Lara and Haleigh on the stern.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.741
I’ll get them off the thing.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.076
Do you want anything
steamed for tonight?

17:15.118 --> 17:16.578
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.495
We’ll pull it.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.372
And then it’s Max up forward.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.002
[latch rattles]

17:24.044 --> 17:26.588
I’m so ready for beer pong,
to be honest.

17:26.629 --> 17:27.964
[cheering]

17:28.006 --> 17:29.257
-Like...
-Oh my God.

17:29.299 --> 17:32.260
You guys, I just got locked
in the bathroom

17:32.302 --> 17:33.720
and I couldn’t open the door.

17:33.762 --> 17:34.929
[laughing]

17:34.971 --> 17:37.390
I was about to start
----ing screaming.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.605
Okay, perfect.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.856
Oh, okay.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.359
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.069
Sandy, that’s the pilot
on the way up to you.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.528
You can release the stern.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.238
Copy, we’re releasing
our stern lines.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.908
Hi. How are you?
Thank you.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.284
That is all stern lines in.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.661
Drop all ground lines.
Drop all ground lines.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.708
You got two meters
on your starboard bow.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.336
Thanks, we’re just waiting
for the ground lines.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.718
Pull.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.969
[grunts]

18:15.011 --> 18:17.180
Yeah, pull.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.817
I’m just waiting for
the ground lines.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.027
Bro!

18:31.069 --> 18:32.070
It’s this one.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.405
Coming up...

18:35.657 --> 18:36.574
What?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.327
Did we hit the refresh button?

18:49.671 --> 18:50.922
What’s taking you so
long on the ground lines?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.216
Here, help me pull on this.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.051
You got a meter on
your starboard side now.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.345
What is happening here?

18:58.513 --> 18:59.848
I’m just waiting
for the ground lines.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.890
Copy that.

19:00.932 --> 19:01.933
We’re on the fenders now.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.059
Okay, okay.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.061
Okay, ground lines are off.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.730
[bleep], why is it like that?

19:06.771 --> 19:07.772
Don’t know bro.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.065
We got two meters on
starboard side

19:09.107 --> 19:10.066
and two meters on port side.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.818
We had too much line out.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.070
Yeah, that was not good.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.238
I pulled the ground line

19:15.280 --> 19:17.407
when we arrived
from the last charter.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.537
...to take off all the ground
lines in a few seconds.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.753
-Are we okay?
-All, good, all, good.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.296
You’re all clear of
the ground lines.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.756
You’re free to swing now.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.382
----ing ground lines.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.051
-Guys!
-Like, where are you going?

19:36.092 --> 19:37.093
Put your bag down
and stay a while.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.678
I want to see the galley.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.471
Can we go see it?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.555
Yeah, you want to see it?

19:40.597 --> 19:42.182
I need to see if
he needs a sous.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.933
-Hello, ladies.
-Hello!

19:43.975 --> 19:45.101
Oh, it looks so fun.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.644
We just wanted to see down here.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.271
This is where
the magic happens.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.649
I’m going to be good this
charter, I promise.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.235
Cheffy, don’t blush.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.112
-I don’t blush.
-I think Cheffy’s blushing.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.906
I’m all set.
Thank you, Luka.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.157
Thank you.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.493
I’m going to make
a pitcher of spicy marg.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.869
Is that going to be fine?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.621
-Absolutely.
-Obviously.

20:04.662 --> 20:05.705
Okay, perf.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.207
You can start
taking those fenders.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.417
Dude, this is
----ing insane.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.045
-Oh, God.
-Oh, it looks so good.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.464
That’s the pilot boat
approaching on starboard side.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.674
Great, thank you.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.012
It’s part of preparation.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.514
Like, you were up here,

20:22.555 --> 20:25.058
you could have brought the line
in, you know what I mean?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.267
It’s okay.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.852
We learn.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.647
Max, I still need to tell him,
hey, this is not going to work,

20:30.689 --> 20:34.526
but do it in a way where
he still respects me.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.861
He’s like a little child
that fell into my lap,

20:36.903 --> 20:40.323
and I think we’re going
to be fine, little boy.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.283
We’re going to be okay,
little Max.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.077
[laughing]

20:44.119 --> 20:45.829
Max is so hot.
I like him.

20:45.870 --> 20:46.913
Max is hot as [bleep].

20:46.955 --> 20:48.039
Where is he?
Go get him.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.124
-Where is he?
-Shall we get him?

20:49.165 --> 20:51.418
Let me call him.
Let me call him.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.794
Let me talk to him.

20:52.836 --> 20:53.670
Max, Max, Leni.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.172
We need you at the ----ing bar.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.173
Yes, for me.
I’m coming.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.425
Look at that.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.801
You’ve done this
before, haven’t you?

20:59.843 --> 21:00.802
Mm-hmm.

21:00.844 --> 21:01.761
Perfect, man.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.057
Ladies...

21:06.099 --> 21:08.393
Max!

21:09.811 --> 21:11.104
Ooh!

21:11.146 --> 21:13.148
-Hey!
-I love Max.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.068
-Are you Italian?
-No, I’m French.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.611
Oh, French.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.406
They’re like, oh, my God!

21:23.742 --> 21:27.078
So we will see you in the
jet ski and get together.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.204
-Yeah!
-Okay?

21:28.246 --> 21:29.456
Do you guys want
to get seated for lunch?

21:29.497 --> 21:31.041
It is ready.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.210
Cheffy, Cheffy. They’re starting
to seat for lunch.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.837
Primary, where do
you want to sit?

21:35.879 --> 21:37.589
The prime seat.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.215
What’s going on, guys?

21:39.257 --> 21:40.508
We’re going on breaks.
Can I get a hug?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.052
I’m just kidding.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.220
I don’t get breaks.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.930
Are you and Jess
going to date now?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.349
-Yeah.
-No.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.475
Why not?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.310
----ing rejected.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.394
Ow!

21:51.436 --> 21:52.270
Embarrassing.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.897
The guests are pretty cute, eh?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.982
Can’t wait to see
them in their bikinis.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.233
Woo-hoo-hoo!

21:57.275 --> 21:59.569
All crew, all crew.
ETA 15 minutes.

21:59.611 --> 22:02.113
Now, that is a ----ing
seafood platter, bro.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.365
Can you carry that
one separately?

22:03.406 --> 22:04.866
-Yeah.
-On your forearms.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.034
Oh, my God!

22:10.830 --> 22:14.709
-Oh my God!
-Cute little chef.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.628
[shouting]

22:16.670 --> 22:19.255
-Are you kidding?
-Oh my God.

22:19.297 --> 22:22.342
The great thing about a seafood
tower is it looks unbelievable.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.719
Got the towers,
got all the different shellfish

22:24.761 --> 22:26.012
and you’re by the sea,

22:26.054 --> 22:28.556
but it’s actually
super easy to make.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.934
We’re doing it with our fingers.
We’re all friends.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.644
-Gorgeous.
-So good.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.853
And I really want
to impress them.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.438
Because when you go up
to the table

22:35.480 --> 22:37.148
and you’re giving the food
to these stunning girls,

22:37.190 --> 22:39.150
and they’re all giving
you this attention...

22:39.192 --> 22:40.568
I’m not Harry Potter anymore.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.362
I feel like I became
James Bond on this charter.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.613
Oh, my God.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.240
Give me another oyster.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.160
Copy that.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.996
Anchor is at the waterline.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.082
We’re gonna go three
in the water.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.667
Copy that.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.002
-Lara?
-Yeah, go.

22:59.504 --> 23:02.924
That is three shackles.
Long stay, one o’clock.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.884
Lock it down.
We’re all set. Thank you.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.761
-Mr. Pearls, what’s up?
-How’s it going?

23:06.803 --> 23:08.388
We’d love jet ski, tube slide.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.015
We’re going to get
everything in.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.808
It’ll probably take us,
like, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.018
Thanks, no rush.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.477
-All good.
-Thank you.

23:14.519 --> 23:15.478
See you soon.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.105
He’s so hot.

23:17.147 --> 23:18.314
Luka’s hot.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.315
Dude.

23:19.357 --> 23:20.483
Maybe I’ll make out with him.

23:20.525 --> 23:21.860
I don’t blame you.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.069
I hate that he’s here
because I’m like,

23:23.111 --> 23:24.654
[bleep] I have a boyfriend.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.450
If he was taller, we would be
talking about my breakup now.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.077
We’d be talking
about gay for pay.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.620
I’m kidding.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.998
But this is the longest time
I’ve been away from Zachary

23:35.040 --> 23:36.666
and it’s really taken
a toll on me.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.002
It’s been a reminder of
how grateful we should be

23:39.044 --> 23:40.295
for what we have.

23:40.337 --> 23:41.755
Interior, interior,
just to let you know,

23:41.796 --> 23:43.173
we’re launching the tenders,

23:43.214 --> 23:44.966
so the boat’s going to
list over a little bit.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.051
Pull me in, please?

23:50.972 --> 23:51.931
Ladies.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.808
[cheering]

23:56.728 --> 23:59.022
-It was so good!
-Was it?

23:59.064 --> 24:00.106
10 out of 10.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.317
I think tonight
it’s tasting menu.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.194
I’ve worked all over the world.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.071
So, each course is going
to be like a different country,

24:06.112 --> 24:07.864
-I think.
-Oh!

24:07.906 --> 24:10.075
I love it!

24:11.076 --> 24:12.202
Well done, Cheffy.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.789
I hate how it’s, like,
off, you know?

24:15.830 --> 24:16.998
You’re telling me, babe,

24:17.040 --> 24:18.375
I thought we were all
on the new page.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.834
-Yeah, me too.
-Last trip we were fine.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.252
Yeah, maybe it’s me.

24:21.294 --> 24:22.962
No, no, it’s not you.
The last trip we were fine.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.547
Yeah, but I wasn’t here
the last trip,

24:24.589 --> 24:26.007
that’s what I’m saying.
Maybe it’s me.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.258
It’s not.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.551
Growing up with my stepdad,

24:28.593 --> 24:32.764
anytime I would have an
attitude or an opinion,

24:32.806 --> 24:34.557
he would shut me down.

24:34.599 --> 24:38.144
And because of that,
I realized I caused

24:38.186 --> 24:43.483
more hurt to the family
if I had my own opinion.

24:43.525 --> 24:46.986
Standing up for myself has been
something I’ve had to learn

24:47.028 --> 24:49.239
as an adult
and I’m still learning.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.534
Jess, Jess, Tumi, could you meet
me by the bar, please?

24:52.575 --> 24:53.910
Copy.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.078
Yeah, good luck.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.164
I’ve got to have a look now
again, because I can’t remember.

24:58.206 --> 25:01.960
Honey, I’m gay.
There’s nothing up there for me.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.045
-To the bathing suit?
-Shall we?

25:04.087 --> 25:05.797
-Lara?
-Yeah?

25:05.839 --> 25:06.923
Can I go in the water, please?

25:06.965 --> 25:08.591
Yeah, yeah.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.010
Coming down.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.470
That was good.

25:12.512 --> 25:16.516
Do you want me to ask one of
the deckhands to give you CPR?

25:16.558 --> 25:17.851
If he’s a hot one.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.811
-That one’s Luka.
-I like all of them.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.146
Oh, bro.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.565
Yeah, they’re going to
start coming down now.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.774
[shouting]

25:26.901 --> 25:28.028
It’s better with one.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.863
Oh, I love the suit.
This is adorbs.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.281
Your tits look amazing.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.282
Ah!

25:33.658 --> 25:35.285
[chattering]

25:36.703 --> 25:38.747
-How was the slide?
-Oh, my God, it was good.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.041
-It’s salty, though.
-So salty.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.959
Is it slippery enough?

25:43.001 --> 25:43.877
Yeah.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.086
Why, you want to
go down with us?

25:45.128 --> 25:47.547
No, I want to make it better
with some soap.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.632
I just swallowed a
gallon of salt water.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.384
Oh, no!

25:52.677 --> 25:53.803
Are you good?

25:57.682 --> 25:58.725
I think I broke my ass.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.518
Did you jump from the top?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.644
Broken!

26:01.686 --> 26:03.563
-Look at this weather.
-It’s amazing.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.231
It’s so perfect!

26:05.273 --> 26:07.359
-I’m back.
-Hi!

26:07.400 --> 26:09.069
Literally...

26:09.110 --> 26:10.612
I’m obsessed with these
----ing sticks.

26:10.653 --> 26:11.905
I don’t even know how I’m going
to use them,

26:11.946 --> 26:13.323
but I love them so much.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.492
Can I clear the air
with you on something?

26:15.533 --> 26:16.868
Yeah.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.579
When Kyle mentioned putting
me on service again.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.873
-Yeah.
-And you laughed.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.083
Yeah.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.960
I wasn’t sure if that
was at, like, me.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.806
It is bothering me
when Kyle mentioned

26:38.932 --> 26:42.727
putting me on service
and you laughed.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.729
I wasn’t sure if that was at me.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.065
Like, I’m not capable
to be on service.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.233
Oh, no.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.318
You definitely are
interpreting that wrong.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.154
It’s because he’s running
away from being on service.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.031
That had nothing to
do with your capability.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.282
Okay.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.743
I was like, I swear we
were just out drinking

26:58.785 --> 27:01.496
and she literally said
I was good at it.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.747
Yeah, I was laughing at Kyle.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.290
I’m like, Kyle, stop now.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.584
The way he says it kind of
makes it seem like I’m green.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.502
You’re not green.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.962
He’s been coming at me like,

27:09.004 --> 27:10.296
oh, she’s going to be
on service all the time.

27:10.338 --> 27:11.923
I’m like, mate, you’re not
running away

27:11.965 --> 27:14.134
from sh--, service queen.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.597
No, no, no.
Why would she say that?

27:19.639 --> 27:20.765
I mean, come on.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.100
That literally had nothing
to do with you.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.476
Yeah, okay.

27:23.518 --> 27:28.064
I respect Jess for asking me
why I said something.

27:28.106 --> 27:31.026
But Natalya, what the
[bleep] were you doing?

27:31.067 --> 27:32.819
It seemed like we had peace.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.654
And now we’re stirring the pot.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.905
Not again.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.282
Like, it’s ----ing
mind-boggling.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.367
Literally had nothing
to do with you.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.453
-Good to know.
-Yeah.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.704
Oh, my God.

27:42.746 --> 27:45.373
Woo!

27:45.415 --> 27:47.334
You’re already halfway.

27:52.756 --> 27:53.798
Yes, sis.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.050
[bleep] me.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.509
We’ll eat you alive.

28:02.974 --> 28:04.309
Cheffy, what’s your
deal for dinner?

28:04.351 --> 28:06.853
I’m trying to think of
a theme in my head.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.647
This is Vietnamese,
there’s Thailand,

28:09.689 --> 28:11.483
there’s Italian,
and there’s England.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.567
Okay, cool.

28:12.609 --> 28:14.277
They’ve asked for
a tasting menu.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.404
I’m going to give everything
what the ----ing kitchen sink.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.947
This is what I can do well.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.491
Even if it’s going to make
my job harder for meself.

28:19.532 --> 28:23.119
When you look like that,
you can have whatever you want.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.122
Two green Peronis.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.123
Thank you.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.625
-That’s one.
-Are we done?

28:32.671 --> 28:33.963
Showing enthusiasm.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.840
You crack me up.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.677
Love you, guys.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.679
So, we’re going to bring
everything in.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.682
If we can leave the docks out,
then we’ll be ready to go.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.808
Have you pulled deco?

28:44.849 --> 28:45.809
No, you can pull deco.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.227
Coming up.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.895
So, there’s these star lights
here that light up.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.522
A little tacky, but I think
you’ll make them work.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.524
Sh--.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.401
Max has got power right now.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.568
Love it.

28:55.610 --> 28:58.738
-Showing enthusiasm.
-The sun is shining.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.073
Need some gold rocks.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.866
I’m going to go and
deal with upstairs.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.535
-Max...
-You’re doing amazing.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.870
You should have done this
slide by yourself.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.288
I love the energy.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.924
[bleep].

29:17.966 --> 29:19.926
Okay, dinner.
Let’s get ready.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.720
We’ll be ready at 8:30.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.096
And that is finished.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.764
All right, you guys
go grab some food.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.182
Yeah, man.

29:28.893 --> 29:30.895
-Cheffy.
-Yo. Try this broth.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.147
-Is it good?
-It’s insane.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.107
Taste that.
Oh, oh, oh.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.734
Here comes the airplane.

29:35.775 --> 29:36.943
Mmm.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.572
Wee!

29:40.613 --> 29:43.450
Ow, ----ing balls.

29:46.119 --> 29:49.205
Oh, my God, what an evening.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.876
Should we sit in the same seats
that we sat for lunch?

29:52.917 --> 29:54.169
Yeah.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.503
Chef, the guests are seated
at the table.

29:55.545 --> 29:56.713
Copy.

29:56.755 --> 29:58.214
-You can start going, mate.
-Got your, hon.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.592
Cheers to the queers, ladies.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.968
[laughing]

30:02.010 --> 30:04.679
So your first course,
rice paper spring roll

30:04.721 --> 30:07.140
with nuoc cham sauce.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.600
Oh, wow.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.268
Vietnamese food
is my favorite.

30:10.310 --> 30:13.063
Natalya and Jess,
how are the cabins going?

30:13.104 --> 30:15.648
Probably another, like,
15 minutes in housekeeping.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.317
Amazing.
Thank you.

30:17.359 --> 30:21.946
Your second course for
tonight is a tom kha broth.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.782
-Ooh!
-Enjoy!

30:23.823 --> 30:24.783
Oh, my God, that is so good.

30:24.824 --> 30:25.992
Mm.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.285
She was nice, then, wasn’t she?

30:27.327 --> 30:28.495
Who was nice?

30:30.830 --> 30:32.248
Why are you confused?

30:33.792 --> 30:36.461
I mean, that’s a conversation
you have to have with her.

30:36.503 --> 30:39.964
I’m hesitant about
going to Natalya

30:40.006 --> 30:42.425
about the conversation
with Tumi.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.135
I don’t want to talk to
her about it at all.

30:44.177 --> 30:47.389
Seems like Natalya has her
own agenda going on

30:47.430 --> 30:48.223
in her brain.

30:48.264 --> 30:49.182
I don’t want drama.

30:49.224 --> 30:50.475
It can’t happen again.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.812
It’s ----ing up my
----ing enniagram.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.772
Like, I’m a peacemaker.

30:57.816 --> 31:01.194
Kyle.
What would I do without you?

31:01.236 --> 31:03.405
You too.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.032
He was at
Coachella this year.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.034
It was the best
show I’ve ever seen.

31:08.076 --> 31:10.286
Have you flown him?

31:12.414 --> 31:15.125
No, but I know like a hundred
girls who’ve hooked up with him.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.502
I love him, but no.

31:18.837 --> 31:21.673
It’s going to be Lara and I’ll
just give you alarms and stuff.

31:21.715 --> 31:24.259
-Thank you.
-See you tomorrow.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.011
Chef, chef,
we’ve started to clear.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.470
Copy.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.514
Natalya, Natalya.
You can go to bed now.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.849
Copy that.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.350
Everything stacked on.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.352
Oh, my God.
This looks amazing.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.646
This is your classic Vongole.

31:36.688 --> 31:37.897
This is ----ing good.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.232
Mm-hmm.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.111
Cheffy, is that
like a meringue?

31:43.153 --> 31:45.030
-It’s a British classic.
-A Eton mess.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.156
Yeah, Eton mess.

31:46.197 --> 31:49.659
Strawberry, cream,
meringue, love.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.873
positive vibes only.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.750
Like, I hate sh-- like that.

32:01.338 --> 32:02.547
I still feel close to Natalya

32:02.589 --> 32:05.133
because of the bond
from the first charter,

32:05.175 --> 32:07.594
but I’m not even
seeing Natalya anymore.

32:11.514 --> 32:15.685
When I’m the adult,
you know you’ve hit rock bottom.

32:15.727 --> 32:18.188
So you have a Eton mess.

32:18.229 --> 32:19.647
Another round of shots?

32:19.689 --> 32:20.899
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.233
Kamikaze.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.443
Isn’t there like a
lot of alcohol in them?

32:23.485 --> 32:24.778
Oh yeah, I just tasted it
and nearly died.

32:24.819 --> 32:25.945
I’m sober.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.113
There is no alcohol
in these drinks.

32:27.155 --> 32:28.114
I think they took it out.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.616
[cheering]

32:30.658 --> 32:31.659
How is dessert?

32:31.701 --> 32:32.702
Everything was perfect.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.287
So good.

32:34.329 --> 32:36.331
Cheffy, Cheffy, we just cleared
dessert and they loved it.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.041
-Are we ready?
-Tumi!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.460
We want you to walk us up.

32:43.338 --> 32:44.756
-I’m going to bed.
-Okay, bye honey.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.174
Bye baby.

32:46.216 --> 32:47.926
-Okay, we’re going up with you.
-Let’s go.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.053
[phone ringing]

32:50.095 --> 32:51.388
Hi.

32:53.264 --> 32:56.267
I’m just in my bed.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.148
Mm-hmm.
What are you doing?

33:02.190 --> 33:03.650
How’s last night?

33:29.968 --> 33:31.845
[laughing]

33:31.886 --> 33:34.597
[chattering]

33:34.639 --> 33:36.516
Oh my God, guys.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.311
[bleep] no!

33:43.148 --> 33:47.444
-Let’s go.
-Oh!

33:48.153 --> 33:50.989
Why the [bleep] is Kyle?

33:51.031 --> 33:52.115
How are you feeling, baby?

33:52.157 --> 33:54.325
I need to go to bed, dude.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.332
How are you girls feeling?

34:01.374 --> 34:03.168
Kyle, where the [bleep]
have you been?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.544
What a party.

34:04.586 --> 34:07.213
The lady you’ve been
waiting for, him.

34:07.255 --> 34:09.090
We haven’t seen you
in 10 minutes.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.800
We’re literally going to die.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.802
You don’t have to clean up.
We don’t care. Don’t vacuum.

34:12.844 --> 34:13.845
That’s just stupid.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.305
We don’t give a [bleep].

34:15.347 --> 34:18.600
Ladies, it’s go the [bleep]
to sleep o’clock.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.977
[laughing]

34:21.019 --> 34:23.605
You’re so tiny!

34:23.646 --> 34:26.775
This is exactly why I
wanted a bit of a break,

34:26.816 --> 34:28.026
not to be on service.

34:28.068 --> 34:30.737
All of these women
are exhausting as hell.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.282
Thanks for the chat, girls.

34:34.324 --> 34:37.118
Thank you for hanging
out with us.

34:37.160 --> 34:40.080
I ----ing love Kyle more
than I love my parents.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.706
[laughing]

34:44.918 --> 34:46.378
Wait, Carly’s asleep there.

34:46.419 --> 34:49.339
-Let’s go to bed.
-Let’s go to bed.

34:49.381 --> 34:51.758
-Car!
-I’m going to go to bed.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.051
Oh, [bleep]!

34:53.093 --> 34:55.053
[beeping]

34:55.095 --> 34:56.429
Good night.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.648
Ugh.

35:13.071 --> 35:14.280
There we go, queen.

35:14.322 --> 35:15.782
I’m going to use this.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.411
That’s just ----ed up.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.747
Oh, God.

35:22.789 --> 35:25.333
Captain, Captain,
what’s your location?

35:25.375 --> 35:26.668
The bridge.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.046
It’s not a positive
conversation.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.756
Aww.

35:31.798 --> 35:32.799
Come on, sit down.

35:34.759 --> 35:36.845
What’s wrong?

35:36.886 --> 35:40.557
I just don’t think mentally
I’m doing well on the boat.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.644
Why?
The boyfriend?

35:44.686 --> 35:46.771
I’m just not coping with it.

35:46.813 --> 35:47.689
My brain’s like...

35:50.108 --> 35:52.819
Well,
I’m so sorry.

35:52.861 --> 35:53.903
Yeah.

35:53.945 --> 35:55.113
How much longer
is there at this state?

35:55.155 --> 35:57.115
How many?
How many charters?

35:57.157 --> 35:59.409
-We have five more.
-Five more.

35:59.451 --> 36:01.953
I love having you on board.
I don’t want you to leave.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.300
I love having you on board.
I don’t want you to leave.

36:16.092 --> 36:17.635
I don’t know.

36:20.430 --> 36:24.059
Well, you’re safe.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.602
You’re okay.

36:25.643 --> 36:28.688
You have me.
You have Kyle.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.857
People care about you, Natalya.

36:30.899 --> 36:32.359
This will pass.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.778
This feeling will pass.

36:34.819 --> 36:36.363
One day at a time.

36:36.404 --> 36:37.530
I was so positive.

36:37.572 --> 36:38.990
And now I’m just like...

36:39.032 --> 36:40.742
It’s okay not to be.
You don’t have to be.

36:40.784 --> 36:41.951
Sometimes you need those days.

36:41.993 --> 36:43.328
So have the day.

36:43.370 --> 36:46.206
Have the day to feel sad
and make a decision for you.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.707
What’s best for you?

36:47.749 --> 36:50.543
Just focus on laundry for the
day. My little happy spot.

36:50.585 --> 36:52.754
-You will get through this.
-Yeah. I’ve got to go.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.214
Yeah.
See, you’re smiling now.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.299
Stand up.
Give me a hug.

36:56.341 --> 36:58.510
-Morning.
-Good morning.

36:58.551 --> 36:59.552
Good morning.

36:59.594 --> 37:00.553
Can I get a iced black coffee?

37:00.595 --> 37:02.847
-Max.
-Hello.

37:02.889 --> 37:03.890
What up?

37:03.932 --> 37:05.475
We missed you terribly
last night.

37:22.033 --> 37:23.576
Is that what she said?

37:29.499 --> 37:31.042
Yeah, well, I was eavesdropping.

37:31.084 --> 37:34.546
At this stage, I’ve got a closer
relationship with Natalya

37:34.587 --> 37:36.131
than any other interior.

37:36.172 --> 37:37.924
So if someone said
that about me,

37:37.966 --> 37:39.634
I would 100% want
my friend to tell me.

37:39.676 --> 37:42.971
It’s just good intentions
coming from this little brain.

37:44.139 --> 37:45.432
What’s her issue?

37:45.473 --> 37:46.975
Like, I’ve done my job
every ----ing day.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.727
Listen, she doesn’t like
you from the beginning

37:48.768 --> 37:50.562
-and she’s like, that’s it.
-She just hasn’t.

37:50.603 --> 37:52.647
Like, for Christ’s sake,
I thought we had moved past this

37:52.689 --> 37:53.940
because we did hit the refresh.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.692
I’m not biting
my tongue anymore.

37:55.734 --> 37:56.985
I’m done with Tumi.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.404
[bleep] off, like, my
problems is not her.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.197
Max?

38:03.825 --> 38:05.702
Just chuck them.

38:05.744 --> 38:06.953
No.

38:06.995 --> 38:08.163
Okay.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.706
Lara, Lara,
can you go to the swim platform

38:09.748 --> 38:11.666
and jump in the water
to get this kayak?

38:11.708 --> 38:13.001
Yeah.

38:17.255 --> 38:19.174
-That works.
-That’s good.

38:19.215 --> 38:22.344
-Christ.
-Run away kayak!

38:22.385 --> 38:24.220
Take the paddle!

38:24.262 --> 38:25.388
This is how we launch kayaks.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.806
-Ready?
-One more.

38:26.848 --> 38:29.893
Maybe like a bit of downforce
on the tail when we--

38:29.934 --> 38:31.978
Yes, exactly.

38:32.812 --> 38:35.231
-Oh, sh--, you okay?
-Exactly.

38:35.273 --> 38:37.192
You all right?

38:41.696 --> 38:42.989
Ready?

38:43.031 --> 38:44.157
Downforce.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.038
Oh, good.
Thank you.

38:51.539 --> 38:52.916
I think I broke my wrist.

38:52.957 --> 38:55.168
All I’m thinking is get to my
cabin,

38:55.210 --> 38:57.796
assess my wrist,
move it around,

38:57.837 --> 38:59.005
and make sure I’m okay.

38:59.047 --> 39:00.590
Nikola, Nikola, Sandy.

39:00.632 --> 39:02.884
Can you come to the bridge?

39:02.926 --> 39:05.095
Jess, Jess,
what’s your location?

39:05.136 --> 39:07.681
Stew pantry.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.725
Yeah, it hurts.
Thank you.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.018
What’s going on up here?

39:12.060 --> 39:14.521
So, at 12, you can go.

39:14.562 --> 39:18.274
-All right.
-All righty.

39:23.279 --> 39:24.572
What?

39:28.034 --> 39:30.328
Natalya, I will never want
someone that’s struggling

39:30.370 --> 39:32.080
at home to
stay on a boat ever, ever.

39:40.672 --> 39:42.215
Did we hit the refresh button?

39:56.062 --> 39:58.356
I’m just saying, like...

40:03.903 --> 40:04.988
Did we hit the refresh button?

40:05.030 --> 40:06.614
A refresh button
does not mean

40:06.656 --> 40:08.283
I have to be friends with you.

40:19.252 --> 40:21.296
If you had, if you honestly
are struggling,

40:21.338 --> 40:22.339
I would want you to come to me.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.757
You’re more than welcome to.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.300
Her feelings are
completely valid.

40:25.342 --> 40:28.762
It’s her tone that
----ing aggravates me.

40:30.263 --> 40:31.931
You know what’s crazy is
I actually expected this.

40:31.973 --> 40:33.850
Maybe you understand
that some of your comments

40:33.892 --> 40:35.226
are actually upsetting people.

40:35.268 --> 40:37.479
That’s fine.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.272
But it doesn’t come
from that place.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.316
So if you can’t accept it,
then I can’t help you on that.

40:41.358 --> 40:44.486
I don’t like being spoken to
like I’m being spoken down to.

40:44.527 --> 40:46.279
Because I’ve had
that my whole life.

40:46.321 --> 40:48.573
And I really can’t.

40:48.615 --> 40:50.658
It lights up the fire
inside of me.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.951
I’m just like, just stop.

40:51.993 --> 40:53.620
-Okay, bye.
-Bye, Natalya.

40:53.661 --> 40:54.829
Bye.

40:54.871 --> 40:55.830
We’re going to chat
all together.

40:55.872 --> 40:57.290
No, we’re not.

40:57.332 --> 41:00.126
Because I don’t want anything
to do with this girl.

41:00.168 --> 41:01.169
Here we go.

41:01.211 --> 41:02.837
Something was going
on downstairs.

41:02.879 --> 41:04.297
-Yeah.
-What do you mean?

41:06.049 --> 41:07.342
Shut up.

41:09.844 --> 41:11.262
Down for cleaning.

41:11.304 --> 41:13.723
When we were launching these,
Sandy fell backwards,

41:13.765 --> 41:15.725
worried she might have
hurt her wrist.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.102
So I hope she’s okay.

41:20.021 --> 41:21.272
If Jess has an issue,
like yesterday,

41:21.314 --> 41:22.982
Jess came to me and
she was like, look.

41:23.024 --> 41:24.442
-Good, did she?
-This is how it is.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.610
Good.
Because I told her too.

41:25.652 --> 41:27.404
That is maturity.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.033
Kyle makes her feel
like a green stew.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.869
The way he says it kind of makes
it seem like I’m green.

41:34.911 --> 41:36.204
You’re not green.

41:36.246 --> 41:37.956
So she’s trying to
turn two tables here.

41:37.997 --> 41:40.208
I’ve done everything
for this girl

41:40.250 --> 41:41.710
and she just swept the floor
with me.

41:41.751 --> 41:44.504
To Tumi, my chief stew.

41:47.465 --> 41:49.426
How dare you?

41:49.467 --> 41:50.927
I’ve had a broken wrist before,

41:50.969 --> 41:52.345
so I just want to
get it checked out.

41:52.387 --> 41:53.471
Yeah.

41:53.513 --> 41:55.432
Nikola’s in charge
while I’m gone.

41:55.473 --> 41:56.474
We got this.

41:56.516 --> 41:57.517
Okay, thank you.

41:57.559 --> 41:58.518
All right.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.644
Like I’m ----ing
sh---ing myself.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.146
I was 50% to blame.

42:01.187 --> 42:04.190
Imagine if I ----ing broke
Captain Sandy’s wrist.

42:04.232 --> 42:05.942
Oh my gosh.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.736
[bleep]

42:07.777 --> 42:08.903
Hi, Jessie.

42:08.945 --> 42:10.030
Why are you telling that
I’m making

42:10.071 --> 42:11.281
you feel like a green stew?

42:11.322 --> 42:12.657
-Did I tell Tumi that?
-You did tell Tumi that.

42:12.699 --> 42:15.243
I mean, sometimes it does
feel like you are.

42:15.285 --> 42:16.953
I don’t even want to apologize
because you know what it sucks?

42:16.995 --> 42:18.496
I was there for you.

42:18.538 --> 42:20.623
And the fact that you said I
made you feel like a green stew,

42:20.665 --> 42:22.042
that sh-- sucks, dude.

42:22.083 --> 42:23.293
I was the only one promoting
you to be in service.

42:23.335 --> 42:25.170
And I told Natalya...

42:27.922 --> 42:29.090
What do you mean it
is triggering?

42:29.132 --> 42:31.134
Why would you go Tumi
behind my back

42:31.176 --> 42:33.720
and tell her that I make
you feel like a green stew?

42:33.762 --> 42:35.138
But not in a bad way.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.015
It’s like, oh, he makes me
feel like a green stew.

42:37.057 --> 42:39.267
Kyle makes me feel great.
Kyle wants me on service.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.269
Kyle’s there to listen to me
when I have a problem.

42:41.311 --> 42:43.605
I’ve been the common
denominators between all of you,

42:43.646 --> 42:45.148
uniting a team.

42:45.190 --> 42:46.608
Good luck.

42:46.649 --> 42:48.026
What happened to her hand?

42:48.068 --> 42:50.820
Just fell backwards
as launching... these kayaks.

42:50.862 --> 42:52.072
I hope she’s all right.

42:52.113 --> 42:53.490
Yeah.

42:53.531 --> 42:55.075
And for you to like literally
throw me under the bus

42:55.116 --> 42:56.659
like that,
that’s really hurtful.

42:56.701 --> 42:58.036
That’s not throwing you under
the bus, so you’re not...

42:58.078 --> 42:59.329
Do you hear the words?

42:59.371 --> 43:01.164
Like you speak English,
I’ll speak English.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.665
What you said was, Kyle makes
me feel like a green stew,

43:02.707 --> 43:04.959
which makes me feel
Kyle belittles me.

43:05.001 --> 43:06.670
Why did I come to you and say
take up service

43:06.711 --> 43:10.131
when I was emotionally upset
and didn’t come to Natalya?

43:10.173 --> 43:12.092
Because I had faith in
----ing you.

43:16.221 --> 43:17.931
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:17.972 --> 43:19.182
Look at this.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.476
What are you reading about?
How to have sex?

43:21.518 --> 43:22.394
Yeah.

43:22.435 --> 43:23.937
Oh my God, he’s highlighting.

43:23.978 --> 43:25.271
Sit down, take a breath.

43:25.313 --> 43:26.189
Can you have a shot?

43:26.231 --> 43:27.607
I don’t think I’m allowed.

43:28.692 --> 43:29.693
It is tempting.

43:29.734 --> 43:31.152
Cheers.

43:31.194 --> 43:32.654
He’s not allowed to do that.

43:32.696 --> 43:33.655
Yeah, we’re not allowed.

43:33.697 --> 43:35.532
I dare you.
Come here.

43:35.573 --> 43:36.741
Don’t even try.

43:36.783 --> 43:39.536
There’s a lot of
like chemistry right now.

43:41.871 --> 43:43.665
Just breathe.

43:43.707 --> 43:45.834
Jess...

43:45.875 --> 43:49.004
All this stupid drama.

43:49.045 --> 43:50.088
Everyone is at their
breaking point.

43:50.130 --> 43:51.548
It could get worse from here.

43:51.589 --> 43:53.299
I’m not your friend.
Don’t talk to me like that.

43:53.341 --> 43:56.261
Focus on your own
----ed up life.

43:56.302 --> 43:58.138
Kyle, I’ve never been spoke
to in my life,

43:58.179 --> 43:59.556
and I can’t believe
actually you’re saying this.

43:59.597 --> 44:00.849
I don’t care.

44:00.890 --> 44:02.017
You’ve been a fake-ass bitch
talking sh--

44:02.058 --> 44:03.018
behind my back
since day one.

44:03.059 --> 44:04.185
Get away from me.

44:04.227 --> 44:05.353
-Kyle, chill.
-Get away from me.

44:05.395 --> 44:08.023
What the actual [bleep]
is wrong with him?

44:08.064 --> 44:09.899
That was horrible.
