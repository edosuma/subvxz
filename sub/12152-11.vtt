<i>Previously on</i> Angel:

00:02.373 --> 00:04.648
If you kill him, I'm gonna lose you.

CHARLES:
We haven't touched each other since...

00:08.333 --> 00:09.925
Since we murdered Prof. Seidel.

00:10.133 --> 00:12.249
- You've been keeping track of me.
- Yes.

00:12.453 --> 00:15.763
You move on Fred, and I'm
gonna put you down hard.

00:15.973 --> 00:18.168
CORDELIA:
<i>It's coming, and no one can stop it.</i>

00:18.333 --> 00:22.167
<i>Connor, you never had a childhood</i>
<i>or anything that's real.</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:25.848
<i>And if this is the end,</i>
<i>I want you to have something that is.</i>

00:26.053 --> 00:29.329
WES: <i>The Beast is planning</i>
<i>to block out the sun, permanently.</i>

00:29.533 --> 00:30.568
Angelus.

00:30.773 --> 00:33.810
ANGEL: <i>The Beast knows me.</i>
FRED: <i>No, it doesn't. It knows Angelus.</i>

00:34.013 --> 00:37.403
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- We need Angelus.

00:37.613 --> 00:42.368
- I'd much prefer we had a plan.
- Wo-Pang. He can deliver Angelus to us.

00:42.573 --> 00:45.849
- What is that?
WO-PANG: A receptacle for his soul.

00:50.013 --> 00:51.571
WO-PANG:
It is done.

00:52.693 --> 00:53.967

CONNOR: Out-of-towners?
- Yeah, Tucson.

01:48.373 --> 01:50.091
Welcome to L.A.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.403
Tourists.

02:07.853 --> 02:10.811
FRED: Seeing Angel's soul all floaty
like that makes me crazy.

02:10.973 --> 02:14.602
It's not forever, sugarplum.
We're just borrowing it.

02:17.133 --> 02:18.327
Cordelia.

02:20.813 --> 02:22.292
Don't drop it.

02:38.213 --> 02:40.443
Angel is gone.

02:44.693 --> 02:46.649
I can't believe...

02:47.693 --> 02:48.682
It's done.

02:48.853 --> 02:52.846
Taking Angel's soul, putting it in a jar?
I hope we know what we're doing.

02:53.053 --> 02:56.887
If Angelus knows how to destroy
the Beast, it's all we've got.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.290
- Yeah, otherwise, permanent midnight.
- He's dangerous.

03:00.493 --> 03:02.449
I know.

03:02.613 --> 03:04.683
I've seen it.

03:07.053 --> 03:10.125
- But we're doing the right thing.
- As long as we're very careful.

03:10.293 --> 03:14.127
Before Angelus was ensouled,
his viciousness was mythic.

03:14.293 --> 03:17.046
- You all know his history.
- Killing, maiming, torture.

03:17.213 --> 03:21.525
Puppies nailed to walls. Thank you,
Cordelia, for that lovely image.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.008
But I think that brings us up to speed.

03:24.213 --> 03:26.408
There's only one thing
Angelus will focus on.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.963
Getting free, so he can slaughter us.

03:30.173 --> 03:35.372
We're Angel's only link to humanity.
Angelus will hate us for that.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.885
He'll want to make us suffer.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.889
Watch the monitor when I go down.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.613
Pay attention to everything he does,
everything he says.

03:45.973 --> 03:50.410
He'll try to confuse you. To play on
your emotions so you drop your guard.

03:50.853 --> 03:53.242
If he succeeds even for an instant...

03:54.653 --> 03:56.803
...we're all dead.

03:59.733 --> 04:03.567
I've spent my life training for this
and I'm still not ready.

04:04.373 --> 04:08.048
He's smarter than I am
and a great deal more focused.

04:08.213 --> 04:12.445
He'll exploit everything Angel knows
about me and go for the jugular.

04:13.773 --> 04:17.243
Whatever he's got,
I'm not going to see it coming.

04:17.452 --> 04:22.288
ANGELUS SINGS:
<i>If you're going to the woods tonight</i>

04:22.453 --> 04:25.763
<i>You won 't believe your eyes</i>

04:25.933 --> 04:31.803
<i>If you're going to the woods tonight</i>
<i>You're in for a big surprise</i>

05:44.173 --> 05:46.050
ANGELUS:
Wes.

05:46.613 --> 05:50.083
Why the long face?
Aren't you happy to see me?

05:50.253 --> 05:52.448
WES: Should I be?
ANGELUS: Well, if it wasn't for you...

05:52.613 --> 05:56.652
...and your shaman friend,
I wouldn't be here. I'm feeling the love.

05:56.853 --> 06:00.084
- The choice was Angel's.
- Angel-schmangel.

06:00.253 --> 06:02.528
You're the man with the brains.

06:02.693 --> 06:06.322
- You're comfortable?
- Nice acoustics.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.046
Wouldn't hate a chair.

06:09.133 --> 06:11.363
You'll have to forgive
the accommodations.

06:11.533 --> 06:15.651
The last time you were free,
you terrorized Sunnydale.

06:16.373 --> 06:20.002
That slayer, she's a pistol.

06:20.533 --> 06:23.923
I've imagined this moment many times.

06:24.093 --> 06:27.210
Years of study, research.

06:27.373 --> 06:32.163
I've read everything
ever written about you.

06:32.373 --> 06:34.568
Stop, I'm blushing.

06:34.893 --> 06:38.442
To be one-on-one
with the legendary Angelus.

06:41.413 --> 06:44.132
As a former Watcher...

06:44.293 --> 06:45.646
...it's a high point.

06:45.853 --> 06:49.846
Buttering me up, getting me all relaxed.

06:50.213 --> 06:54.445
Not the most innovative
interrogation technique...

06:54.613 --> 06:56.490
...but okay, I'll play.

06:56.693 --> 06:59.730
- Is it a game?
- Hey, open book.

06:59.893 --> 07:01.485
Anything you want to know.

07:03.093 --> 07:05.766
How sweet that virgin Gypsy tasted.

07:06.373 --> 07:11.493
The special smell of a newborn's neck.
My first nun. Now, that's a great story.

07:12.573 --> 07:16.248
- We could start there.
- Don't be coy, Wes.

07:16.413 --> 07:20.531
You're just dying to know
about the big Beastie.

07:20.693 --> 07:23.412
- Fire away.
- All right.

07:23.573 --> 07:27.612
- Did you know the Beast?
- Well, now that's a question.

07:27.773 --> 07:32.051
Not a great question.
Not even an insightful question.

07:32.253 --> 07:34.687
Not a Wyndam-Pryce-worthy question.

07:34.853 --> 07:37.890
If you knew the Beast,
why wouldn't Angel remember?

07:38.093 --> 07:41.165
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't
remember the good times.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.649
Maybe he won't let himself.
So like him.

07:46.653 --> 07:48.769
Here's one for you.

07:48.933 --> 07:52.164
What's the deal with Angel
and the <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark?</i>

07:52.373 --> 07:56.127
- The movie?
- Perfect-day fantasy he came up with.

07:56.293 --> 07:59.649
Caves, booby traps...

07:59.813 --> 08:01.963
...the requisite phallic sword.

08:02.253 --> 08:06.132
- He fought the Beast in the fantasy.
- Real candy-ass.

08:06.333 --> 08:09.769
- The Beast?
- Angel. Not enough to be the hero.

08:09.933 --> 08:12.845
Couldn't be happy unless
the whole gang's pitching in.

08:13.053 --> 08:17.285
- So he killed the Beast in his fantasy?
- Had to, to get what he wanted.

08:17.493 --> 08:19.882
We all want something, Wes.

08:20.053 --> 08:22.283
It's the way of the world.
Everybody's got an agenda.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.810
And you're going to tell me mine.

08:26.413 --> 08:30.452
You want to come down here,
get your vital stats on Lava Boy...

08:30.613 --> 08:32.888
...be a hero.
- I want to know how to kill the Beast.

08:33.053 --> 08:36.044
- It has nothing to do with being a hero.
- Sure, it does.

08:36.212 --> 08:38.443
But why now?

08:38.933 --> 08:41.527
Can't be because
there's an apocalypse coming.

08:41.693 --> 08:45.083
- Always one of those around the corner.
- Enlighten me.

08:45.293 --> 08:48.285
The foul rag-and-bone shop
of the heart.

08:48.693 --> 08:50.445
That's where you live.

08:51.453 --> 08:52.966
Meaning?

08:54.173 --> 08:58.405
You want to impress the girl.
Move in, get her to love you.

08:58.573 --> 09:03.089
And after a couple of days of flowers
and chocolate-covered cherries...

09:05.013 --> 09:06.765
...you'll bend her over the counter...

09:06.973 --> 09:08.804
Is that supposed to rattle me?

09:11.173 --> 09:14.210
Kind of bony for my taste...

09:14.373 --> 09:18.651
...but different strokes.
- The Beast called you an adversary.

09:18.813 --> 09:25.082
Bet he loves to rub that shiny bald head
against her soft, milky skin.

09:25.253 --> 09:27.892
Mmm. Good.

09:31.013 --> 09:32.685
ANGELUS:
<i>Come on, Wes.</i>

09:35.613 --> 09:39.083
<i>Not like your school-girl crush</i>
<i>is a secret.</i>

09:42.093 --> 09:45.244
Charles, remember, we can't
believe anything Angelus says.

09:45.453 --> 09:48.172
How about the stuff that's true?
Can we believe that?

09:48.453 --> 09:52.890
He distorts everything.
He lies with the truth.

09:53.053 --> 09:56.409
It's part of what makes him
so dangerous.

09:56.573 --> 10:00.327
- Yeah, don't let him get to you, kiwi.
- He's not the only one that's getting.

10:00.493 --> 10:02.131
Charles.

10:02.293 --> 10:03.885
I know.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.565
I know.

10:07.093 --> 10:08.924
It's just words.

10:09.093 --> 10:11.687
You found a vulnerability, exploited it.
Well done. Can we move on now?

10:14.173 --> 10:16.641
I'm just getting started.

10:17.693 --> 10:19.524
Tell you this.

10:20.333 --> 10:25.088
All that digging you've been doing
on the horny giant?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.406
Wrong place.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.448
And the right place?

10:31.973 --> 10:33.929
I could tell you.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.532
It wouldn't be sporting.

10:35.733 --> 10:39.726
But you were adversaries,
you and the Beast.

10:40.093 --> 10:45.486
Guy like me: Friends, enemies,
hard to keep track.

10:45.773 --> 10:49.288
If he was an enemy, I'd be doing
you a favor destroying him.

10:52.253 --> 10:55.086
You know, you're not fooling anyone.

10:55.293 --> 10:58.285
Get some new clothes,
cool haircut, hit the gym.

10:58.493 --> 11:02.372
You're still the same loser none of the
other kids wanted to sit with at lunch.

11:02.573 --> 11:06.771
Yet you're locked in that cage,
and I'm out here.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.651
So?

11:12.213 --> 11:16.172
You got no leverage.
What are you gonna do, kill me?

11:16.933 --> 11:18.571
If I have to.

11:21.373 --> 11:24.046
Wait'll they drop, Wes,
then try that line again.

11:24.253 --> 11:27.211
I'll put your soul back.
You won't talk, no problem.

11:27.373 --> 11:29.489
We'll bring Angel back
and be no worse off.

11:29.693 --> 11:31.968
Making you a failure again.

11:32.173 --> 11:35.688
You want to waste my time,
you can rot down here.

11:36.493 --> 11:41.328
Nice stamina, Wes.
No wonder Fred's not interested.

11:41.693 --> 11:44.048
Whatever your connection
to the Beast, clearly...

11:44.213 --> 11:46.044
...you don't know anything
that can help.

11:46.213 --> 11:51.606
ANGELUS: This where I'm supposed to
get defensive? Talk to prove you wrong?

11:51.973 --> 11:54.123
What else have you got?

11:54.653 --> 11:57.406
You must hate it...

11:57.573 --> 11:59.882
...that Angel fights evil.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.930
ANGELUS:
Eats you up inside, doesn't it?

12:02.093 --> 12:06.405
Seeing all those idiots flock
around him, calling him a champion.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.123
Anyone ever call you a champion?

12:12.093 --> 12:13.811
- I do my part.
ANGELUS: Right.

12:14.053 --> 12:19.571
Like letting Lilah suck Lorne's brain.
Or here's an oldie, but a goodie.

12:19.733 --> 12:23.408
Faith. Good job being her Watcher.

12:25.173 --> 12:26.925
She turned out to be a peach.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.363
And you managed to get
your soul back twice...

12:29.533 --> 12:32.684
...saving the world several times
in the process. Nobody's perfect.

12:32.893 --> 12:35.851
Then there's kidnapping
the fruit of my loins.

12:36.013 --> 12:38.925
- Smooth.
- He survived.

12:40.453 --> 12:43.809
I guess you just can't understand
that special bond...

12:43.973 --> 12:47.807
...between dad and son, given that
your own father's ashamed of you.

12:47.973 --> 12:49.645
And Connor's ashamed of you.

12:49.813 --> 12:52.202
The universe's way
of maintaining order, I guess.

12:53.693 --> 12:57.652
That twerp really gives me
the creeps. You?

12:57.853 --> 13:01.402
In Cordelia's vision, you and the Beast
were standing on a field.

13:01.573 --> 13:07.011
Oh, God, yeah.
Let's talk about Cordy, shall we?

13:08.093 --> 13:10.812
Now, there's a rack
to write home about.

13:10.973 --> 13:14.249
Too bad about the personality, though.
Yap-yap-yap-yap.

13:16.053 --> 13:19.489
ANGELUS:
<i>"Oh, God. Oh, Angel. Angel.</i>

13:20.373 --> 13:22.603
<i>We can 't.</i>

13:22.813 --> 13:27.011
I love you, but you were so bad.

13:27.733 --> 13:30.406
You ate babies."

13:31.413 --> 13:33.210
Chicks.

13:33.933 --> 13:36.322
- Sticks and stones, sweet potato.
- We don't have to...

13:36.493 --> 13:38.529
No, I'm okay.

13:38.693 --> 13:42.572
Like you said, just little bitty
bits of truth twisted all up into lies.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.803
ANGELUS:
<i>Which do you think is worse, Wes?</i>

13:45.013 --> 13:48.801
Stealing my kid like you did,
or banging him...

13:49.373 --> 13:51.682
<i>... like Cordelia?</i>

13:51.853 --> 13:57.166
<i>All that bumping and grinding,</i>
<i>fire raining in the sky.</i>

13:57.773 --> 13:59.889
<i>Quite a picture.</i>

14:00.053 --> 14:03.329
<i>Well, more of a snapshot,</i>
<i>because Connor...</i>

14:03.493 --> 14:04.767
[ANGELUS CHUCKLES]

14:04.933 --> 14:07.925
Well, now that's just ridiculous.
Connor's Angel's son.

14:08.093 --> 14:10.049
It would be like sleeping
with your own...

14:12.853 --> 14:14.002
Oh.

14:14.173 --> 14:17.643
ANGELUS: <i>At least you thought</i>
<i>you were doing the right thing.</i>

14:17.813 --> 14:22.091
<i>Hey, who 's a guy gotta kill</i>
<i>to get a drink around here, huh?</i>

14:22.773 --> 14:23.842
[DOOR SLAMS]

14:26.133 --> 14:28.647
Connor, what happened?
Are you all right?

14:28.853 --> 14:32.243
They're coming from all over.
Too many to fight.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.965
What?

14:38.413 --> 14:40.051
He wants blood.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.249
- I'll get it.
- Me too.

14:50.293 --> 14:53.046
ANGELUS:
Othello and Desdemona.

14:53.213 --> 14:54.851
My favorite couple.

14:55.013 --> 14:58.767
Oh, wait, Desdemona wasn't in love
with the other guy.

15:00.453 --> 15:03.525
So much for "stand by your man."

15:04.613 --> 15:07.650
Then again, you probably
like her on her knees.

15:07.853 --> 15:10.447
Keep talking. I'll sweep out
the cage when I'm done.

15:10.653 --> 15:13.804
Oh, provocative. Get me all riled up.

15:13.973 --> 15:16.931
- You think that's what your boss wants?
- I don't have a boss.

15:17.453 --> 15:20.490
You might want to tell Wesley that.

15:21.853 --> 15:23.684
Oh, Fred.

15:25.453 --> 15:28.650
You look all fresh and sweet.

15:29.413 --> 15:31.529
I hear you at night...

15:32.053 --> 15:35.841
...in your room with Gunn.

15:36.493 --> 15:38.609
The things you say.

15:38.933 --> 15:44.212
I'm lying there listening,
hands under the covers.

15:44.373 --> 15:48.161
I can't help myself, it's so gripping.

15:49.213 --> 15:52.011
This coming from a guy
who can't get any, ever.

15:54.093 --> 15:55.685
You're a pig.

15:56.213 --> 15:58.010
Step back.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.885
Might get some now.

16:40.293 --> 16:44.445
I like the way you move, Fred.
Do it just a little to the left.

16:44.613 --> 16:45.807
Charles.

16:46.693 --> 16:48.524
Come on, Charles, save her.
Come on, save her.

16:48.693 --> 16:49.842
[TRANQUILIZER GUN FIRES]

17:03.013 --> 17:05.925
- Are you okay? He hurt you?
- No.

17:06.093 --> 17:09.449
I'm sorry, that was so stupid.
I should've...

17:09.613 --> 17:11.968
It's not your fault.
Angelus is unpredictable.

17:12.133 --> 17:16.012
He'll take any opening,
no matter how small.

17:17.853 --> 17:20.651
It's understandable,
but you played right into his hands.

17:20.813 --> 17:22.405
Never drop your weapon.

17:22.613 --> 17:24.444
I was...

17:25.173 --> 17:27.050
- Thanks.
- So you're okay?

17:27.213 --> 17:30.922
Yeah, I'm just glad you're here.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.289
Hope you...

17:43.813 --> 17:45.849
...like black.

17:46.653 --> 17:48.405
Thanks.

17:52.773 --> 17:56.163
- This is his.
- Lf you don't like it, I could ask Lorne.

17:56.373 --> 17:57.931
It's fine.

18:02.013 --> 18:05.323
- You're not going back out?
- Somebody has to.

18:05.533 --> 18:07.888
You're exhausted.
You said there were too many...

18:08.093 --> 18:10.653
I want to get out of here. Okay?

18:12.053 --> 18:14.772
Everybody still looks at me
like I'm connected to the Beast.

18:14.933 --> 18:16.810
CORDELIA:
No.

18:17.373 --> 18:21.651
The looking earlier,
that wasn't about the Beast.

18:22.453 --> 18:24.409
It was because of us.

18:27.013 --> 18:31.086
Angelus said some things
about the night we...

18:31.973 --> 18:36.524
You know? The weirdness
is because everyone knows.

18:37.053 --> 18:38.725
Good.

18:39.093 --> 18:42.130
- Connor...
- Angel doesn't care if everyone knows.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.648
- Why should I?
- It's not Angel.

18:45.893 --> 18:49.169
Anyway, you should get some rest.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.211
You don't want to be with me,
fine, you're not...

18:52.373 --> 18:54.682
...but don't tell me what to do.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.644
FRED:
Hey.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.371
Hey.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.646
Angelus mentioned something
about a sword in Angel's fantasy.

19:11.293 --> 19:13.090
I thought...

19:14.253 --> 19:16.642
I wanted to thank you.

19:17.453 --> 19:20.843
If you hadn't have come in
when you did...

19:23.693 --> 19:25.763
He's not there.

19:26.973 --> 19:28.725
It's...

19:29.973 --> 19:32.965
Charles heard what Angelus said.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.852
- The stuff about...
- Me.

19:37.333 --> 19:41.121
- Yeah, and...
- How I feel about you.

19:42.453 --> 19:45.411
Yes. Which is very sweet.
There's nothing wrong with it.

19:45.573 --> 19:46.892
Yes, there is.

19:56.693 --> 19:59.082
CHARLES:
Hey, who's watching the monitor?

20:01.933 --> 20:04.652
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

20:05.613 --> 20:08.491
- Did he just...?
- Of course not.

20:08.653 --> 20:11.087
Charles, you're right. The monitor.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.012
You better tell me
what the hell I just walked in on.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.164
We were just...

20:17.013 --> 20:20.244
- What, researching?
- Deal with me. Leave Fred out of it.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.569
- You leave Fred out of it.
- Hello, I'm here.

20:22.733 --> 20:25.122
- I see the way you look at her.
FRED: Charles, please.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.245
And you. Running to him when you
need help. I'm not good enough?

20:28.413 --> 20:30.290
No, that's not...

20:30.453 --> 20:33.968
- This isn't the time.
- I'm telling you, stay away from her.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.806
[CHARLES RAISES HIS VOICE]

20:41.973 --> 20:44.533
That was fast.

20:46.093 --> 20:49.085
CHARLES: Long time since you
were out for anyone but yourself.

20:49.253 --> 20:52.006
WES: I owe you nothing, not anymore.
- You take what you want.

20:52.173 --> 20:54.129
FRED: Come on.
- Don't matter who it belongs to.

20:54.293 --> 20:57.524
- I didn't realize Fred came with a deed.
FRED: Stop. What's wrong with you?

20:57.693 --> 20:59.684
CHARLES: You don't realize
that nobody wants you here.

20:59.853 --> 21:01.764
Because you do such
a bang-up job without me.

21:01.973 --> 21:04.203
- Hey, come on, let's not say...
- Shut up, Lorne!

21:04.373 --> 21:07.729
Great idea, stealing Angel's kid.
Was losing him a part of your plan too?

21:07.893 --> 21:11.090
Go ahead, throw some more
blame around. It's what you're best at.

21:11.293 --> 21:13.011
- You want to say that again?
- Oh, God.

21:13.213 --> 21:15.363
Face it, you can't give her
what she needs.

21:15.573 --> 21:17.291
Charles!

21:19.933 --> 21:21.810
Stop it! This is insane.

21:21.973 --> 21:23.247
CORDELIA:
You're doing what Angelus wants.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.290
LORNE:
Oh, for the love of Mike Tyson.

21:29.733 --> 21:31.564
Fred...

21:50.893 --> 21:53.282
Everyone's afraid of you.

21:55.173 --> 21:57.482
Is that my shirt?

21:57.653 --> 21:59.564
Not anymore.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.687
Looks good on you, son.

22:03.893 --> 22:07.408
- So did Cordy.
- She looks good on everybody.

22:08.973 --> 22:11.567
Angel warned me about you.

22:12.093 --> 22:14.607
Said I should remember
you're not my real father.

22:14.853 --> 22:16.525
Yeah.

22:18.453 --> 22:21.809
That was a nice speech. Touching.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.813
I think it ended with you
promising to kill me.

22:25.013 --> 22:27.766
- I remember.
- Kind of unnecessary, don't you think?

22:27.933 --> 22:30.083
I mean, with your track record...

22:30.253 --> 22:34.292
...I'll be staking myself
by the end of the day.

22:35.733 --> 22:39.487
- That's fine by me.
ANGELUS: Darla felt the same way.

22:39.653 --> 22:43.487
It made her sick,
you squirming inside her.

22:43.653 --> 22:47.043
So she jammed a stake
in her own heart...

22:47.253 --> 22:49.892
...so she wouldn't have to hear
your first whiny breath.

22:50.053 --> 22:52.886
- You don't know anything.
- Then there was Holtz.

22:53.253 --> 22:56.882
You disappointed him so much
that he stabbed himself in the neck.

22:57.093 --> 22:58.890
My fa...

23:00.613 --> 23:03.047
Holtz was a good man.

23:03.453 --> 23:06.729
All he ever wanted was for you
to get the punishment you deserve.

23:06.893 --> 23:08.611
And you will.

23:08.773 --> 23:14.006
And now my boy's in love.
All hearts and flowers.

23:17.413 --> 23:20.962
But doesn't it freak you out that
she used to change your diapers?

23:21.173 --> 23:25.371
I mean, when you think about it,
the first woman you boned...

23:25.533 --> 23:29.731
...is the closest thing
you've ever had to a mother.

23:30.653 --> 23:34.407
Doing your mom
and trying to kill your dad.

23:36.133 --> 23:37.771
There should be a play.

23:39.453 --> 23:42.445
You think I care what you say?

23:43.253 --> 23:47.212
Angel told me
how you'd try to hurt me.

23:47.373 --> 23:52.083
How you weren't my real dad,
just some animal in a cage.

23:53.013 --> 23:55.049
Angel's my dad.

23:55.213 --> 23:58.285
- I'm gonna cry.
- That's what he told me.

23:58.453 --> 24:00.887
And he thought I believed him.

24:03.293 --> 24:05.443
The truth is...

24:08.733 --> 24:12.089
...Angel's just something
that you're forced to wear.

24:16.093 --> 24:18.448
You're my real father.

24:24.373 --> 24:26.489
ANGELUS:
I'm right here.

24:26.653 --> 24:29.486
All you have to do is come and get me.

24:31.973 --> 24:34.043
You'd like that.

24:34.853 --> 24:37.447
You couldn't take me anyway.

24:38.693 --> 24:39.887
We'll see.

24:40.053 --> 24:44.092
Promises, promises. Don't make
them if you can't keep them.

24:44.293 --> 24:46.170
I wouldn't think of it.

24:47.653 --> 24:51.089
Might be your best chance.

24:56.293 --> 24:58.568
Don't disappoint Daddy.

24:59.133 --> 25:00.566
CORDELIA:
Connor.

25:04.613 --> 25:06.683
Go upstairs.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.725
No.

25:10.893 --> 25:13.930
Please, go upstairs.

25:20.453 --> 25:25.129
- It's your lucky day.
- Yeah, go to your room, mama's boy.

25:34.693 --> 25:37.969
Cordy, Cordy, Cordy.

25:38.333 --> 25:40.210
Just couldn't stay away.

25:40.733 --> 25:45.488
It's been a long day, and I think
you've done enough damage.

25:45.933 --> 25:48.572
So no hug?

25:49.973 --> 25:53.010
- You and I are gonna make a deal.
- Tough.

25:53.173 --> 25:56.449
Did you practice that in
front of the mirror a few times?

25:57.333 --> 26:00.211
Let me guess. You want
to know about the Beast.

26:00.413 --> 26:02.643
Everything you know.

26:03.533 --> 26:07.412
And in return, I get what?

26:08.773 --> 26:12.891
Wouldn't mind a car.
I hear the new Mustang is nice.

26:13.293 --> 26:14.806
Something better.

26:15.413 --> 26:17.483
What's a better ride than a Mustang?

26:21.773 --> 26:23.445
Me.

26:27.813 --> 26:30.646
- You?
- That's the offer.

26:30.973 --> 26:33.362
No more stalling, no more games.

26:33.573 --> 26:36.406
If you tell us what you know,
you get me.

26:36.693 --> 26:41.050
Must be some confusion.
You took out the soul.

26:41.213 --> 26:44.444
- Still have the brain.
- Then use it.

26:44.653 --> 26:47.850
The Beast, the darkness,
the world is falling apart.

26:48.013 --> 26:51.289
We're out of time. We're out of ideas.

26:51.453 --> 26:55.924
- You're the end of the line.
- Wes was better at buttering me up.

26:56.893 --> 26:58.929
You know what it means
to be a champion.

26:59.093 --> 27:01.288
I'm trying so hard to forget.

27:01.493 --> 27:04.849
Sometimes a sacrifice
needs to be made.

27:05.013 --> 27:06.810
And you're the little lamb.

27:07.293 --> 27:11.844
Not that there aren't a few things
I wouldn't mind doing to that body.

27:12.813 --> 27:14.326
Other than the obvious.

27:14.533 --> 27:18.651
Tell us about the Beast
and you can do whatever you want.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.285
- You're lying.
- Look in my eyes.

27:26.093 --> 27:28.448
Angel knows me.

27:28.613 --> 27:32.162
You know me better than anyone.

27:32.413 --> 27:36.929
So when you look at me,
you know I'm not lying.

27:43.493 --> 27:45.051
I don't understand.

27:45.213 --> 27:48.250
Why is Sid Vicious suddenly
Mr. Show-and-Tell?

27:48.413 --> 27:52.326
Well, honey-buns here must have
a secret stash of Higher Power dust.

27:53.093 --> 27:55.368
Something like that.

27:55.533 --> 27:58.889
- He's ready, Wes, whenever...
- Why don't you tell us what you did?

28:01.173 --> 28:04.404
- I did what I had to.
- Which means what?

28:06.093 --> 28:07.731
- Cordelia...
WES: Connor's right.

28:07.893 --> 28:10.646
We're painfully aware
of Angelus' ability to manipulate...

28:10.853 --> 28:13.128
- I'm not being manipulated.
- It'd be better if I knew.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.528
It's better if you don't.

28:16.453 --> 28:18.205
All right.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.171
WES:
<i>Shall we start from the beginning?</i>

28:20.533 --> 28:21.966
Why not?

28:22.133 --> 28:24.010
WES:
A year?

28:24.173 --> 28:27.051
1789.

28:27.253 --> 28:29.084
So you were in Prussia.

28:30.173 --> 28:32.971
You have been doing your homework.

28:34.653 --> 28:36.371
Those Prussian girls.

28:37.533 --> 28:40.889
ANGELUS:
<i>Must be the pastries. Worth the trip.</i>

28:41.053 --> 28:45.365
<i>All that sweetness gets</i>
<i>into their blood.</i>

28:45.533 --> 28:49.492
WES: <i>Very interesting. At some point</i>
<i>the Beast will appear?</i>

28:49.653 --> 28:54.886
ANGELUS: <i>Patience, Wes. I was taking</i>
<i>a shortcut on my way to Vienna.</i>

28:55.453 --> 29:00.288
Started feeling like someone
was watching me.

29:00.453 --> 29:03.650
There were troops around.
I'd run into them now and then.

29:03.813 --> 29:06.964
<i>Not as sweet as the girls, by the way.</i>

29:07.133 --> 29:10.250
<i>But the little massacre I ran into?</i>

29:10.413 --> 29:13.689
<i>Seriously lacking in military precision.</i>

29:14.293 --> 29:18.650
<i>Bodies, bodies everywhere...</i>

29:18.813 --> 29:21.566
<i>... and not a drop to drink.</i>

29:22.413 --> 29:25.962
So I followed the trail...

29:26.173 --> 29:28.448
...and there was your friend.

29:28.653 --> 29:32.612
The one you
so cleverly call the Beast.

29:32.973 --> 29:35.612
We had a lot in common.

29:37.853 --> 29:40.651
<i>But he already knew that.</i>

29:40.973 --> 29:45.330
He'd been watching me.
He staged the carnage to impress me.

29:46.413 --> 29:49.769
So he sought you out. Why?

29:49.973 --> 29:53.568
Girl trouble. Thought I might be
able to help him with a situation.

29:53.773 --> 29:55.491
- How?
ANGELUS: <i>You've heard of...</i>

29:55.653 --> 29:59.043
<i>... the Svea Priestesses?</i>
<i>Very powerful. Big into banishing.</i>

29:59.493 --> 30:01.324
"Vanishing"?

30:01.493 --> 30:03.211
"Banishing."

30:03.453 --> 30:05.762
<i>ANGELUS:</i>
<i>The Beast was next on their list.</i>

30:05.973 --> 30:10.171
He couldn't touch them. Some kind
of mojo, but a vampire could.

30:10.693 --> 30:15.926
- So he wanted you to kill them.
ANGELUS: <i>We had it all worked out.</i>

30:16.373 --> 30:18.329
<i>I'd scratch his priestesses...</i>

30:18.493 --> 30:23.123
<i>... and he'd scratch my back somewhere</i>
<i>down the line. A limited partnership.</i>

30:23.613 --> 30:28.004
You need not be my enemy.
Join with me, Angelus.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.892
And?

30:31.693 --> 30:34.605
I declined. He didn't ask twice.

30:34.813 --> 30:38.169
I probably could have been more
diplomatic with my refusal...

30:38.693 --> 30:40.490
...but I'm not big with teamwork.

30:40.933 --> 30:45.688
<i>Thought that was going to be the end</i>
<i>of me, but like I said, girl trouble.</i>

30:48.133 --> 30:52.126
So they just started up
the whammy...

30:52.813 --> 30:54.326
...and there you have it.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.922
The Beast was banished.

30:57.093 --> 30:59.448
- How?
- Don't know.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.332
<i>I was busy with the passing out.</i>

31:02.653 --> 31:06.123
CORDELIA: Slarf demons, spell mantras,
Srail'gong technique, but nothing on...

31:06.293 --> 31:09.603
FRED: "The Svea Priestesses,
also known as the Svear...

31:09.773 --> 31:14.051
...a mystical order, all descendants
of a powerful Nordic priestess Svea."

31:14.213 --> 31:16.443
CHARLES: They've been busy.
- Anything about the Beast?

31:16.653 --> 31:20.965
Nothing definitive, but this one
looks like it could match up.

31:23.773 --> 31:27.322
WES: Same region.
Approximately the same time period.

31:29.533 --> 31:33.003
I'm shaky on Freyan runes,
but it kind of seems like...

31:33.173 --> 31:37.530
...it's only a general idea
of who or what got banished.

31:38.053 --> 31:44.162
Translation: Something like,
big, hard thing.

31:45.493 --> 31:48.087
- Sounds like our guy.
LORNE: Fantastico.

31:48.453 --> 31:50.523
So where do we find
these banishing babes...

31:50.693 --> 31:53.161
...and how fast can they get to L.A.?

31:53.333 --> 31:56.848
About 25 minutes, depending
on traffic. They're in Pacoima.

32:08.373 --> 32:11.922
[BELL RINGS]

32:18.613 --> 32:20.922

It's open.

32:26.573 --> 32:28.211
Hello?

32:30.213 --> 32:32.681
Anyone home?

32:56.373 --> 32:58.523
What is that?

33:23.333 --> 33:25.403
WES:
We're too late.

33:26.773 --> 33:28.491
Again.

33:28.653 --> 33:32.532
How does the Beast know
exactly what we're gonna do?

33:32.693 --> 33:34.809
It's like he's psychic.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.248
Maybe he is.

33:37.413 --> 33:40.450
Or he's been watching us at the hotel.

33:40.613 --> 33:45.448
Angelus could have sent him a message,
some kind of demon Morse code.

33:46.173 --> 33:49.529
No, these people have been
dead for a few days.

33:49.693 --> 33:51.763
Angelus had nothing to do with this.

33:51.933 --> 33:55.130
Which means by the time the shaman
was going all chanty on Angel...

33:55.293 --> 33:56.931
...it was already too late.

You mean...

33:59.373 --> 34:01.728

34:01.893 --> 34:03.372
...for days?

34:03.533 --> 34:05.410

With the chaos outside...

34:06.413 --> 34:08.802
...probably no one even noticed
they were gone.

34:09.253 --> 34:11.005
We should have seen this coming.

34:11.172 --> 34:14.688
Of course the Beast would go
after the priestesses.

34:15.933 --> 34:17.525
Let's have a look around.

34:19.253 --> 34:21.926
Then we should call the police.

34:23.253 --> 34:26.529
A banishment incantation,
at least I think it is.

34:26.693 --> 34:28.763
Then they were trying to
get rid of the Beast.

35:17.893 --> 35:21.568
Dead demons are just
a big blob of oozing mess.

35:22.693 --> 35:26.686
Vampires turn into dust like they
were never anything at all.

- He's so relaxed.
- It's like he's not even in a cage.

In his mind, he's not.

- They didn't get the Svear?
- No, the Beast did.

Slaughtered the entire family.

36:53.813 --> 36:57.362
- He found a way to kill them after all.
- So much for our big priestess rescue.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.446
Are we sure Angelus doesn't
know anything more?

37:00.613 --> 37:03.923
- I mean, maybe we should talk to him.
WES: No.

37:04.133 --> 37:05.851
He's told us everything
he's going to.

Oh, God, I'm always missing
the fun stuff.

Maybe a stray baby toe?
