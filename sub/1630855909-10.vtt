WEBVTT

00:39.789 --> 00:43.001
I'm gonna rip out your spleen
and feed it to your husband!

00:43.001 --> 00:44.586
Wouldn't want that.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.089
Morty, we'd better run before
it figures out what a husband is.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.842
This carnival of nightmares
used to be scary, right?

00:50.842 --> 00:53.178
- We've seen too much.
- It sucks, you know?

00:53.178 --> 00:55.555
Cause it's fun
to break off a scare now and then.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.267
Did I hear you fellas wishing
for some good old fashioned scares?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.144
I mean, I more wish
you wouldn't eavesdrop.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.938
Who are you?
Does the suit mean you work here,

01:03.938 --> 01:05.565
or that you super don't work here?

01:05.565 --> 01:08.318
Like yourselves,
I'm a connoisseur of fear.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.112
I'm also originally from Earth.
And did you know Earth

01:11.112 --> 01:13.990
is the home of the single
scariest place in the galaxy?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.575
I can show you if you like.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.410
We were headed that way anyway.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.414
- Take a left. Almost there.
- We know where Earth is.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.583
For guys like you, you know,
who've seen it all

01:23.917 --> 01:26.795
there's only a few real fears
left to conquer.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.215
And one of them is right down here.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.137
- Okay, what the hell.
- This is punching down.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.515
Denny's is a nice chain
that gives people starchy food

01:38.515 --> 01:40.016
- when they're up late.
- It's a hack joke, buddy.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.643
No, this is the place.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.062
Good luck to both of you.
I'm gonna get myself a slam.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.233
- He just wanted a ride, right?
- He certainly took us for one.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.944
As long as we're here...

01:51.778 --> 01:53.738
Ok! Lumberjack Slam,
Grand Slamwhich,

01:53.738 --> 01:56.032
Pancake Puppies, Slamburger,
two milkshakes...

01:56.032 --> 01:57.575
and an order of Cheddar Tots.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.744
Let me know when you want your check,
and if you're here for The Hole,

01:59.744 --> 02:01.621
- it's in the men's bathroom.
- The what now?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.998
- Hole?
- The Fear Hole. Men's bathroom.

02:15.134 --> 02:17.595
Well, it's definitely a hole,
they weren't lying about that.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.639
Is that hair? Seaweed?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.559
Boy, it's really circling
the whole rim.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.936
Guess you gotta jump in
without touching the sides?

02:24.936 --> 02:26.896
You think there's spikes on the bottom?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.982
I don't think they want you
to go in there and just die.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.233
What kind of business would that be?

02:30.233 --> 02:33.403
Well, they're not drowning in money.
They still have a built-in TV/VCR.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.073
- It's that carnival guy.
- So he gets a kickback.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.410
<i>Hi. Welcome to The Hole.
Here's how it works: You jump in.</i>

02:40.410 --> 02:43.997
<i>The Hole manifests your greatest fear.
You conquer that fear, and come out,</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:47.041
<i>well, fearless.
And you get your picture on the wall!</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:48.418
<i>What does The Hole get out of it?</i>

02:48.751 --> 02:51.838
<i>Well, you know those fish
that nibble dead skin off your feet?</i>

02:51.838 --> 02:55.758
<i>The Hole's kinda like that.
It eats fear. You win. It wins.</i>

02:55.758 --> 02:57.385
<i>Have fun, and enjoy the Ho...</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:01.681
<i>Hey Gaddafi, cool your jets
with a taste of Mountain Dew!</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:05.476
This has been here since VHS tapes
and there's only three photos?

03:05.476 --> 03:08.396
- My tots are getting cold.
- So you don't want to do it?

03:08.396 --> 03:09.814
- Do you?
- I mean...

03:09.814 --> 03:12.066
It says it takes away
your greatest fear.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.402
My greatest fear, Morty,
is trusting a gross hole

03:14.402 --> 03:17.655
to conquer my fear, and I
conquer that fear by walking away.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.948
Okay, fine.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.327
You little turd!

03:25.288 --> 03:28.583
- Oh God!
- <i>Oh God!</i>

03:30.627 --> 03:33.713
<i>Hold still
while i stuff you with maggots!</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:36.174
Rick!

03:37.133 --> 03:39.719
Okay! The Hole thinks
I'm scared of not having a gun?

03:42.805 --> 03:43.932
Fear conquered!

03:45.433 --> 03:49.687
Check out dem gains! Morty!
Where are you, Morty? Let's go!

03:50.188 --> 03:52.815
- Oh jeez! Oh god, oh jeez!
- Man! We both shit our pants!

03:52.815 --> 03:54.817
- Christ, Rick! My button.
- What a fucking ride!

03:54.817 --> 03:58.404
- Maggots in my button!
- Fuck yeah, on the wall, motherfuckers!

03:58.404 --> 04:00.281
It's not worth it! Not worth it!

04:03.701 --> 04:05.954
Oh my god, you both reek.
What is that?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.205
Morty and I shit our pants.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.540
You're looking at the two
newest members of the Hole Club.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.250
Okay, sluts.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.503
What the hell?

04:14.003 --> 04:19.384
Bomb almost killed her.
Take care of our wife.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.180
Rick? No!
Oh my God! No, no!

04:24.722 --> 04:27.600
- Mom?
- Where am I? Who are you people?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.019
You're my mom, but, you're young?

04:30.019 --> 04:33.481
- Rick, what's happening??
- Wait. Rick?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.275
What the fuck, Grandpa?
Say something!

04:36.859 --> 04:39.237
- Okay, we're clearly still in the hole.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.321
We never left the hole and...

04:40.321 --> 04:42.198
And part of the hole is thinking
you left the hole and then

04:42.198 --> 04:43.491
And then it can really dig into you.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.369
Because you can't really be scared
of anything if you know you're

04:46.369 --> 04:47.996
- Still in the hole!
- Still in the hole!

04:47.996 --> 04:49.455
What the fuck are you two talking about?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.582
Why is dead Grandma alive
in our living room?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.251
Rick, why are you old?

04:53.251 --> 04:54.293
All great questions.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.421
You guys get reacquainted
while we grab some equipment.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.882
Wait, are we sure this isn't, like,
a double mislead?

04:59.882 --> 05:02.135
A double mislead like
we went into a generic fear hole

05:02.135 --> 05:04.762
and then coincidentally
came home to that? That's...

05:05.221 --> 05:07.807
That's my wife.
From the day I lost her.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.517
Well, what's it got to do with me?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.061
- Rick?
- Right!

05:12.061 --> 05:14.272
I think I figured it out, Morty.
Your greatest fear,

05:14.272 --> 05:16.399
is me getting Diane back
and being happy again.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.483
What? Why?

05:17.483 --> 05:19.318
Because then I won't need you.
Look how scared you're

05:19.318 --> 05:22.196
- getting just talking about it.
- I'm not scared, I'm insulted.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.323
What kind of
backhanded-ass theory is that?

05:24.323 --> 05:26.200
My greatest fear is you hooking up?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.745
You're right, we can't know for sure
until I get more data.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.873
Alright family!
Who wants to catch up over ice cream?

05:32.623 --> 05:35.334
I knew he was working
on teleportation. But...

05:35.334 --> 05:37.170
Wouldn't this be time travel?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.422
Dad never touches time travel.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.506
He calls it the Long...

05:40.506 --> 05:42.592
Long Island Iced
Tea of science fiction.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.927
Yes, but then what is this?

05:44.927 --> 05:46.846
Don't worry about it,
it's not real. Okay!

05:46.846 --> 05:48.639
I figure it's better to do this
in front of you,

05:48.639 --> 05:51.934
I didn't want to walk in de-aged.
What do you think, D? 45? Younger?

05:51.934 --> 05:55.063
I don't care about your age, Rick.
I don't even want to call you that,

05:55.063 --> 05:58.107
that's my husband's name,
he just died.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.108
I know.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.568
So, 27?

06:00.568 --> 06:03.780
- Dad! You're traumatizing her.
- What? It's my face, too.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.158
And now Diane gets to understand
that I'm still sexy and a genius.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.326
What a kindness.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.079
You were right, Rick,
I'm really terrified right now.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.331
Terrified of what?
If you don't mind,

06:13.331 --> 06:16.125
I'd like to get to know
the adult version of my...

06:16.501 --> 06:17.585
Oh my God!

06:17.585 --> 06:19.504
Where's my real daughter?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.505
Sweetie, it's all right.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.883
This may as well be our real daughter,
because she's just as real as you.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.009
- What?
- Put it this way.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.677
You're all basically NPCs.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.138
Only Morty and I are real,
so your side quests don't matter.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.141
- The main quest is... us.
- You're disgusting.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.103
You're talking about our baby girl
like she's theoretical?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.563
- Welcome to the family.
- No, you don't get it, honey.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.565
Even if this was real,
she'd be only a version

06:39.565 --> 06:41.567
of your daughter who could also
be a clone of your daughter.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.862
Stop wearing my husband's face!
You're nothing like him!

06:44.862 --> 06:48.157
- Because I lost you!
- Maybe you didn't deserve me!

06:53.746 --> 06:54.956
You want to hear a new theory?

06:55.456 --> 06:59.919
Maybe your greatest fear is getting
a second chance with her and blowing it.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.046
You don't think that fear
is been pretty well faced?

07:02.046 --> 07:06.217
Then you haven't conquered it.
Or accepted it. Or something.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.927
"Or something?"
I'm not a fearologist!

07:07.927 --> 07:09.720
Morty, all rom-coms have an arc.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.265
Even You've Got Mail begins
with Tom Hanks killing that cop.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.266
- Really?
- I don't know!

07:13.266 --> 07:14.892
I'm not going to fucking
watch You've Got Mail.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.562
I'm doing this for you, Morty.
The sooner I get her back,

07:17.562 --> 07:20.731
the sooner you can conquer your fear
of being a useless, lonely turd.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.025
You don't think that's been faced?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.491
<i>Hello Diane,
here's the song I rehearsed.</i>

07:30.825 --> 07:33.077
<i>You had a bad day
and Rick made it worse.</i>

07:33.494 --> 07:38.332
<i>He felt bad, so he created me.
I deliver you waffles and an apology.</i>

07:38.791 --> 07:41.085
<i>Why do I have memories
of being a human child?</i>

07:41.085 --> 07:42.378
<i>- Why would I need...</i>
- Shit!

07:42.879 --> 07:43.588
Goddammit!

07:43.588 --> 07:46.424
There was a whole second verse about
inviting you to the zoo with the family.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.135
I've seen that robot's arms.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.305
I used them on a law enforcement drone
that the Feds had me build.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.306
It's how we...

07:54.265 --> 07:55.224
How I met my wife.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.810
The zoo sounds nice.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.438
And this one time,
we raised a civilization living

08:00.438 --> 08:03.649
on a zit on my face, and Grandpa
helped me rule over it as queen.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.860
It sounds like you guys
are a real family now.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.154
I wish you could've been
part of it, Mom.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.282
- Oh, honey!
- Rick!

08:11.282 --> 08:13.201
Is there a deadline
on this theory you're chasing?

08:13.659 --> 08:17.496
Yeah, sure!
That's a good idea, Morty. Do that.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.210
I always wished I knew
what they were saying.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.420
Your Master's thesis.
Nonhuman Intelligence.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.963
When did you read that?

08:26.297 --> 08:27.215
After you were gone.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.925
It helped me develop this.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.053
Fuck you! Fuck you, Greg!

08:32.053 --> 08:33.512
- Fuck you, Lisa! Bread.
- No!

08:33.512 --> 08:34.972
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you! There's bread.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.808
- I guess that's what I expected?
- Anticlimactic isn't it.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.852
They kinda suck.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.273
Wanna grab a drink?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.526
Yeah, alright!

08:58.996 --> 09:01.582
When did you stop being a lightweight?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.751
Kept looking for my wife
at the bottom of a bottle.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.086
You're pathetic.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.838
Hey! To being pathetic.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.136
Clear!

09:24.105 --> 09:25.356
My turn, my turn.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.115
I'll tell you what, Old Man.
Seems like losing me made you cooler.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.409
I should die more often.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.452
You did.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.289
You died everywhere forever.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.708
You're the only thing I can't replace.

09:43.708 --> 09:48.045
Okay, okay, Mr. Weepy.
I'm not even real, remember?

09:48.379 --> 09:50.840
Nothing's real, that's your jam, right?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.384
My grandson... our grandson...

09:53.384 --> 09:56.387
thinks this is happening because
my greatest fear is letting you go.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.222
- Then don't.
- I don't want to.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.850
- Then kiss me.
- I'm old and we have puke mouth.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.019
Well, I'm not here
and it's not real puke.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.404
Okay, Rick! Dude...

10:13.404 --> 10:14.864
Fuck you Morty, it's a blazer.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.532
That's not what I meant.
You look sick.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.869
- The hole is feeding on you.
- I thought it's supposed to eat my fear.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.412
Can we get some fucking rules
up in this hole?

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
I don't know the rules!
Maybe you're just dying

10:23.414 --> 10:24.832
because you've been in here too long!

10:24.832 --> 10:27.710
Interesting theory.
I wonder why you're so rosy-cheeked.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.627
What are you saying?

10:28.627 --> 10:30.921
Maybe the real you
is off somewhere running from spiders.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.256
So now I'm not real?

10:32.256 --> 10:35.259
Maybe my greatest fear is having
to tell you to fuck the fuck off.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.053
- Go ahead and face it!
- Fuck the fuck off!

10:37.053 --> 10:41.015
- Ready to Showbiz Pizza?
- Lemme see that bear play banjo!

10:41.015 --> 10:43.976
Here's one for ya.
I'm afraid of watching you die.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.312
I like that theory, Morty.
So stop watching.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.486
Okay, this is it. You nailed it.
My worst nightmare.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.363
I'd like to leave The Hole now.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.742
Hey, Hole, I'm talking to you.
Are you listening?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.379
So, what are you, like, the Hole?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
The Hole's promoter?
The Hole's intern?

11:13.547 --> 11:14.673
Is there a hole here?

11:14.673 --> 11:18.552
Right! I'm supposed to go in there
and be shocked that there's no hole,

11:18.552 --> 11:21.138
or that there is a hole?
What difference would it make?

11:21.138 --> 11:23.265
You are hard to scare.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.642
And Rick isn't, right?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.936
The Hole's gonna, like,
suck on him forever

11:26.936 --> 11:29.688
because his big secret
is that he's got the most fear?

11:29.688 --> 11:32.024
Well, we can certainly say
you're not afraid to be reductive.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.903
I doubt your grandpa has "more" fear
than the average asshole in a Denny's.

11:35.903 --> 11:36.987
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Sorry!

11:36.987 --> 11:40.574
If anything, he seems pretty brave.
He's certainly not afraid to die.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.076
Maybe that makes his fear extra...

11:42.827 --> 11:43.744
delicious.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.332
So, what, he's scared of love?

11:48.332 --> 11:51.210
Everyone's scared of love, dipshit.
You'll learn that in your twenties.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.338
It takes a very rare,
very powerful being to be

11:54.964 --> 11:56.340
terrified of happiness.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.633
- Dumb.
- You're dumb.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.093
That's why you're
not scared to be happy.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.886
The smarter you are, the more you know.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.389
Happiness is a trap.
It can't last forever.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.266
Let's say you meet
the love of your life,

12:05.266 --> 12:07.685
well, it's still gonna end...
It's inevitable!

12:08.018 --> 12:10.062
Whether by the slow pull of a disease,

12:10.062 --> 12:12.273
or the shock of loose footing
on a hiking trail.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.567
whether it be the corrosion
of two personalities

12:14.567 --> 12:16.819
that reshape each other
until they're incompatible,

12:16.819 --> 12:19.280
or maybe the old stranger in a bar
who says the things

12:19.280 --> 12:22.199
that need to be said,
to that person, that night.

12:22.616 --> 12:26.162
The point is... Happiness always ends.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.289
Best case scenario, think about this.
Best case.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.500
Is that you die at the same time.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.545
- Yikes.
- Can't the Hole just let me go then?

12:34.545 --> 12:35.713
Sounds like I don't matter.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.549
You don't. But if you go,
you'll take him away. Don't worry.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.885
Rick will die
before accepting happiness.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.095
After that, we'll chase you
with some clowns

12:43.095 --> 12:44.555
or some dumb shit like that.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.309
But Grandpa... Grandpa's gonna die.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.728
Just like Diane.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.446
Sir, you've been in this booth
for a really long time,

13:00.446 --> 13:02.198
- one coffee isn't gonna cut it.
- That's fair.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.492
- Wanna split some pancake puppies?
- No!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.370
Beth? Summer? Anyone!

13:08.370 --> 13:10.414
Dad, it's not real. Neither are you.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.416
If that's true, then you deal with it!

13:13.042 --> 13:14.710
You know what, you're right.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.380
How about this?

13:18.380 --> 13:21.300
- Morty! What are you doing?
- Being scared!

13:26.013 --> 13:27.848
How is that not enough fear?

13:27.848 --> 13:29.600
You're the one scaring me, Morty!

13:29.600 --> 13:30.893
No, Dad, it's okay!

13:30.893 --> 13:33.270
It's not okay! That wasn't normal!

13:35.356 --> 13:38.526
My greatest fear is not being accepted.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.735
It should be!

13:39.735 --> 13:41.946
And you need to fear
it a hell of a lot more!

13:43.197 --> 13:44.281
I can do that.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.407
You like that?

13:45.824 --> 13:46.867
Do you want to die?

13:46.867 --> 13:49.995
I have enough unaddressed trauma
to flood this hallway.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.375
You fucking idiot,
this list says Top Five Things

13:54.375 --> 13:55.668
and you only wrote down four.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.092
Trust fall!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.470
None of us touch or speak
to this kid ever.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.224
Maybe take a picture,
send it to your friends?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
Not a bad idea.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.812
How can we do the school play
if Johnny has laryngitis?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.356
- There's no understudy!
- Put me in the play.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.358
- You don't know the lines.
- Yes I do.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.444
Three Days of Rain?
I have it memorized.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.405
And I refuse to prove
that until you cast me.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.074
Have it your way,
but The New York Times is coming,

14:27.074 --> 14:30.327
and they're doing a feature on the
current state of young American theater.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.497
Perfect.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.792
- It ended in a church? What?
- Yeah!

14:36.792 --> 14:39.420
They'd already died
it was purgatory or something.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.255
How did your universe's version end?

14:41.255 --> 14:44.758
Jack, Locke and Sawyer teamed up to kill
a fog monster and everyone got rescued.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.219
It was one season long
and it was perfect television.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.888
You can be great
or you can be around forever, right?

14:49.888 --> 14:53.142
True.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.477
- True.
- Where's this going?

14:55.477 --> 14:57.104
- True.
- We doing robot roleplay?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.397
- True.
- I've got oil at home.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.524
- True.
- What was that? Diane!

15:00.524 --> 15:01.483
Diane?

15:01.483 --> 15:04.236
- Diane.
- Stay with me! Diane?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.779
Rick? What's happening?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.574
Fucking Morty!
He's trying to hog the hole. C'mon!

15:15.873 --> 15:19.335
Alas, our father is dead.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.004
Walker, are you here?

15:24.465 --> 15:32.056
I'm Walker.
Sure has been raining a lot of days.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.683
What the fuck is he doing?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.644
What's wrong with him?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.897
He's naked.
And why does he look sick?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.358
Because he's dying.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.944
Fuck.
I gotta get him out of here.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.072
But if I do,
I might have to go with him.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.617
I don't want to.
I don't want to, Diane.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.577
I think my greatest fear
is letting you go.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.205
That's a good fear, Rick.
Keep that fear.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.083
If you don't, you'll kill me. Again.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.086
I know.
But I don't have to kill Morty too.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.547
How do you know he's even real?
Look at his weird little balls.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.092
Goodbye, Diane.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.263
- Rick...?
- Shut up Morty.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.974
DJ, drop that beat,
we gotta conquer a fear!

16:18.602 --> 16:20.938
<i>This is my grandson
don't look at his pee-pee</i>

16:20.938 --> 16:23.565
<i>stead of staring at Morty
put your eyes on me</i>

16:23.565 --> 16:26.235
<i>I'm a roped-out freak
loose dog in my ass</i>

16:26.235 --> 16:29.071
<i>macaroni in my pocket
Rickity masterclass.</i>

16:29.071 --> 16:31.657
<i>I don't know how to rap
I don't know how to rhyme</i>

16:31.657 --> 16:34.284
<i>i don't know how to rap
now eat my shit!</i>

16:35.536 --> 16:36.745
Incredible.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.581
<i>Now throw your hands up!
And put your hands down.</i>

16:39.581 --> 16:42.000
<i>Throw your hands up!
Now put them back down!</i>

16:43.001 --> 16:45.254
<i>Three days of rain!</i>

16:48.006 --> 16:50.134
That was an astounding feat
of personal bravery.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.220
Nudity always makes theater
serious and good.

16:53.887 --> 16:54.930
How do you feel?

16:54.930 --> 16:56.515
Accepted. You?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.516
Pathetic.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.393
But...
Happy?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.160
We did it!
We conquered our fears. Right?

17:19.496 --> 17:23.292
Rick! You just looked real sad,
which I'm afraid of.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.504
You know, of being responsible
for your sadness.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.716
Which means, I think,
we might still be in The Hole.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.887
Well, I am definitely afraid of you
ever knowing anything before me.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.514
So, I'd say there's a 100% chance
that we're still...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.810
God damn it.
Is this going to be a whole thing?

17:41.810 --> 17:42.895
No wordplay, Morty.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.355
We have to figure out our actual fears
if we're ever going to get out of here.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.899
- Actual fears?
- Yeah!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.567
Tell me your fucking fear
so we can conquer it.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.279
I just had to crucify myself in order
to save you from your Hole Wife,

17:52.279 --> 17:54.865
and you think I'm the one
with unresolved fears?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.658
I oughta be afraid
that we'll never get out,

17:56.658 --> 17:58.368
because you'll never admit
that you're afraid!

18:01.872 --> 18:03.957
Okay. Good job.
You conquered it, right?

18:04.374 --> 18:06.668
I think so?
How are we supposed to know?

18:06.668 --> 18:08.587
No, this is real, I can tell.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.839
You're not afraid that you
could be certain about something

18:10.839 --> 18:12.382
and still turn out to be wrong?

18:14.009 --> 18:16.428
- You cowardly asshole!
- How was I supposed to know?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.266
Eight dollars for a side of bacon?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.060
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:23.060 --> 18:24.978
It's a symptom
of a larger concern, Morty.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.231
- If capitalism collapses...
- Are we done here?

18:27.564 --> 18:30.317
I don't know. Aren't you a little
afraid at this point of The Hole itself?

18:30.317 --> 18:31.318
What?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.695
I swear to God!
If we're still climbing out

18:33.695 --> 18:35.531
of this fucking Hole
two seasons from now.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.115
- Maybe that was it.
- What?

18:37.115 --> 18:40.285
Maybe we needed to let go
of our fear of uncertainty. You know?

18:40.869 --> 18:41.954
Right.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.081
I'd say we're pretty native
to that at this point.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.041
- Okay thank you, Hole!
- Thank you, Hole!

18:46.041 --> 18:49.419
We no longer need to know
if we're in you! So Bye!

18:57.511 --> 18:58.929
Are you afraid we're still in it?

18:58.929 --> 19:01.473
I mean, I hope we're not,
but if we are...

19:01.473 --> 19:03.851
- We'll find out eventually.
- Which no longer scares me.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.061
Same.
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.902
<i>Move on they say,
you'll feel better with time.</i>

19:15.112 --> 19:18.824
<i>But time alone can't heal
This heart of mine.</i>

19:22.119 --> 19:26.582
<i>You can't go back,
That's the only rule,</i>

19:27.916 --> 19:31.670
<i>But rules were meant to break
when it comes to you.</i>

19:33.589 --> 19:39.469
<i>I saw time and time,
Slip by when I withdrew,</i>

19:39.845 --> 19:44.808
<i>I wandered far and wide,
Without you.</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:47.853
<i>Without you.</i>

19:59.781 --> 20:05.078
<i>So I bury my dead,
And I try to start again,</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:10.125
<i>But it will never be the same
As it was back then.</i>

20:11.919 --> 20:17.841
<i>I've seen time and time,
Slip by, but I'll make do,</i>

20:18.383 --> 20:21.678
<i>-‘Cause I won't live my life...</i>
- Oh my God, I've turned into my dad!

20:24.056 --> 20:26.808
Maybe there's no way out.
Maybe we were born here.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.646
- C'mon. We're gonna get through this.
- I'm staying here.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.190
No. We're Rick and Morty.
I'm not leaving without you.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.108
What did you say?

20:35.108 --> 20:37.945
I said I'm not leaving you in here.
Come on. You're irreplaceable.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.240
- What?
- Oh my god.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.742
I know what I'm afraid of.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.370
I'm afraid you'd never say
that in real life.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.372
I'm afraid that if I jumped into a hole,

20:48.372 --> 20:50.457
you wouldn't even bother
jumping in after me.

20:50.457 --> 20:54.294
You'd just stand there and watch.
This entire thing has been about me.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.756
You're not even in the hole, are you?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.009
<i>Thank you for visiting
the Fear Hole, Morty.</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:04.471
<i>Your fear of relying on Ric
has been delicious.</i>

21:04.471 --> 21:06.974
Dear God!

21:09.017 --> 21:11.561
Morty! How was it?
Was it spiders?

21:11.937 --> 21:15.315
Oh jeez. Oh my god, no. You...

21:16.024 --> 21:18.777
- You didn't go in at all?
- No, it's a one-person ride.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.904
You can't face two fears
at the same time.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.948
If my fear was fire
and yours was water...

21:22.948 --> 21:24.366
I get it. It's fine.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.161
It really is fine.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.789
You do seem a little less burdened.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.625
Rick, am I irreplaceable?

21:33.625 --> 21:37.170
- I mean, define "irreplaceable".
- That's good. Good.

21:38.922 --> 21:39.840
I'm back.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.010
Don't!
Or I won't know if I'm out!

21:43.010 --> 21:44.886
- Is it that good? Should I go in?
- No.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.346
You holding out on me?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.849
You don't want to deal with it, Rick.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.227
There was messed-up mental shit
in there. Like, Diane was in there.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.520
- What?
- Not in a good way.

21:53.937 --> 21:54.896
Just trust me.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.691
Okay, buddy.
Let's go slam some pancakes.

22:47.240 --> 22:51.036
How bout that? Season 7!

22:51.036 --> 22:53.246
It was touch and go
there for a second.

22:53.246 --> 22:58.126
Remember when I stole my kid?
I stole one of these too!

23:01.797 --> 23:06.635
It's all about having a goal
and stopping at nothing to achieve it!

23:06.635 --> 23:09.554
Then you'll be fulfilled!
