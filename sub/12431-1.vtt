Louie...

02:54.449 --> 02:57.652
There's something
I have to tell you.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.820
Now?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.990
I'm in love with Corinne.

03:04.376 --> 03:06.452
I know.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.451
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God

03:49.546 --> 03:52.167
and in the face of this company

03:53.383 --> 03:59.303
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony,

04:00.015 --> 04:02.932
which is an honorable
state, instituted of God...

04:09.399 --> 04:15.687
<i>Washington DC Enactment of the Civil
Rights Bill by July 4th was assured today</i>

04:15.780 --> 04:18.450
<i>when Representative Howard Smith</i>

04:18.533 --> 04:22.033
<i>announced a meeting of the
House Rules Committee.</i>

04:22.120 --> 04:24.279
<i>Mr. Smith a Virginia Democrat</i>

04:24.372 --> 04:29.367
<i>made his announcement only 24 hours
before the majority of Congress</i>

04:29.461 --> 04:31.537
Louie?

04:38.303 --> 04:39.762
Louie?

04:46.311 --> 04:48.387
Happy anniversary!

04:49.439 --> 04:52.725
- You're dressed.
- Yeah, but I don't have to be.

04:54.361 --> 04:59.153
Well, get undressed and get back
in bed. I have something for you.

04:59.241 --> 05:04.448
- Well, can't you give it to me here?
- No, I want to give it to you there.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.328
Come on!

05:09.417 --> 05:10.449
OK.

05:15.382 --> 05:19.214
No, Louie. That's not
the way I planned it.

05:20.303 --> 05:22.629
So this is a planned thing.

05:22.722 --> 05:28.642
Yes. I wanted to be here in bed when I
gave you your anniversary present, because

05:28.728 --> 05:31.054
this is where it was made.

05:33.817 --> 05:35.893
We're having a baby?

05:38.155 --> 05:40.231
A baby?!

06:10.061 --> 06:11.853
Philip!

06:11.938 --> 06:15.853
<i>♪ To be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife. ♪</i>

06:15.942 --> 06:20.189
Though from my
personal point of view

06:20.280 --> 06:22.356
Philip!

06:23.575 --> 06:26.410
I started without you.
Happy anniversary!

06:26.495 --> 06:27.189
What is this?

06:27.215 --> 06:29.935
A cherry tree. And it
promises to bear fruit.

06:29.998 --> 06:33.616
- Which is more than I can say for you two!
- You shouldn't have.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.201
To my two favorite people.

06:38.715 --> 06:40.624
Philip?

06:40.717 --> 06:42.710
We're having a baby.

06:44.054 --> 06:47.174
How are we going to break
the news to Louie?

06:47.265 --> 06:49.174
Philip...!

07:32.811 --> 07:36.559
- Are you working today?
- Lady Bird's launching a new petunia bed.

07:36.648 --> 07:40.266
I'm the lucky stiff who gets to
cover it. Not to be missed!

07:40.360 --> 07:45.236
- Big interview?
- Yes, I'm interviewing Lady Bird's gardener.

07:47.159 --> 07:50.409
Philip, I think we'll
call the tree George.

08:04.676 --> 08:06.799
Bye.

08:11.099 --> 08:14.385
- Philip!
- Hey, now don't forget. 8 o'clock.

08:14.478 --> 08:17.182
Remember my cousin Ann?
She was at our wedding?

08:17.272 --> 08:20.606
- The one with the overbite?
- She's having them worked on!

08:20.692 --> 08:23.812
She's coming up from
Charlottesville for the weekend.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.569
- Maybe the four of us could get together.
- Louie...!

08:27.657 --> 08:30.861
- Well, OK. Just thought I'd ask.
- Don't ask.

08:30.952 --> 08:33.028
Good time...

08:33.121 --> 08:35.197
Bye!

08:41.129 --> 08:43.205
Mr. Jeffries! Come in.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.082
Come in, come in!

08:48.011 --> 08:50.087
She is going to love these.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.256
An excellent choice.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.430
Give my regards to your wife.
And happy anniversary!

08:57.521 --> 09:03.025
In view of the testimony of the
witness and the arguments of counsel,

09:03.109 --> 09:06.941
I have decided to grant the defendant's
motion to suppress the evidence.

09:07.030 --> 09:10.779
Permission to approach the
bench, Judge Fenwick.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.824
Approach.

09:19.751 --> 09:22.076
Your Honor, I won't have a case.

09:22.170 --> 09:26.631
Without that evidence, the counts
against Tony Bonino are out the window.

09:27.592 --> 09:29.964
I have to follow the rules
of evidence, Louie.

09:30.053 --> 09:32.461
<i>In my judgment a search
warrant was required,</i>

09:32.556 --> 09:34.762
therefore the evidence
is inadmissible.

09:34.850 --> 09:38.219
But he'll be back on the streets.
We know Bonino is one of the most

09:40.605 --> 09:43.855
cunning and powerful individuals
in organized crime.

09:44.442 --> 09:46.400
Are you quite through?

09:47.154 --> 09:49.111
Court is adjourned.

10:33.658 --> 10:34.939
Jeffries.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.111
Listen, I've got something here.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.659
<i>- It's a tip or something.
- Yeah? What is it?</i>

10:39.748 --> 10:42.203
- Something on Bonino.
- Bonino?

10:42.292 --> 10:45.163
<i>- Interested huh?
- Oh, yes, I'm interested!</i>

10:45.253 --> 10:47.744
The beach, Roosevelt Island. 6.30.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.814
Judge Fenwick! My God!

13:12.484 --> 13:14.560
- Excuse me.
- Yes? Hi.

13:15.111 --> 13:17.519
I have to get out of here.
How do I get back?

13:17.614 --> 13:20.449
You just got here, hon.
You haven't been processed.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.907
You'll get back. It just
takes a little while.

13:23.995 --> 13:27.696
- Wait at the end of the line, please.
- Uh, look, you don't understand.

13:27.791 --> 13:30.198
I have to get back to my wife.
She's pregnant.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.664
And my best friend, Philip...
he'll be lost without me.

13:33.755 --> 13:37.089
And my job. I'll lose my job, my
dinner reservations, my life.

13:37.175 --> 13:40.046
We understand those
things here. We really do.

13:40.136 --> 13:40.945
Come with me.

13:40.971 --> 13:44.206
Thanks. I've been feeling
very strange lately.

13:44.266 --> 13:49.640
What do you expect? Your body's a cream
sauce all over Wisconsin Avenue!

13:49.729 --> 13:53.597
Here it is, end of the line. Thank
you very much, and please wait.

13:53.692 --> 13:55.731
How are you doing? Fine?

13:55.819 --> 13:57.610
Corinne!

13:57.696 --> 14:00.816
- No, no, no. You're making a scene.
- Cori...!

14:03.869 --> 14:05.908
All right, all right!

14:05.996 --> 14:08.072
Come with me.

14:12.627 --> 14:14.620
Good. Just one more thing...

14:16.590 --> 14:17.621
Bye.

14:22.721 --> 14:24.713
Here's your shot. Hold still.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.808
OK?

14:27.893 --> 14:29.684
Omar? Omar!

14:31.438 --> 14:33.810
Hopeless case of attachment.

14:33.899 --> 14:37.184
- They'll take care of you here.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.194
I need to go to Washington DC.
That's in North America.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.815
I know where Washington is,
thank you. Boy or a girl?

14:43.909 --> 14:46.530
- What's that?
- You want to be reborn a boy or a girl?

14:46.620 --> 14:49.905
I don't want to be reborn at all.
I want to go home now, just as I am.

14:49.998 --> 14:52.833
That's impossible. You're
between bodies right now.

14:54.544 --> 14:58.708
Look, you're a soul, a spirit. The
only way to get back is to be reborn.

15:00.425 --> 15:03.177
- You got a problem with that?
- I guess not.

15:03.261 --> 15:05.966
- As I was saying, boy or girl?
- Boy.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.803
- OK, there's an Eskimo woman giving birth...
- No, I don't want to be an Eskimo.

15:11.728 --> 15:15.477
Son of an African chief. You'll
inherit ten wives on your 16th...

15:15.565 --> 15:17.558
No! No, I have a wife.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.402
OK. Uh, here's an
interesting situation.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.563
Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.989
- Great location.
- No. East coast, OK? East coast.

15:26.076 --> 15:29.030
Pool or trust fund?! We can get
you there in three months.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.663
I can't wait!

15:30.747 --> 15:32.621
You're really in
a hurry, huh? OK...

15:32.707 --> 15:35.459
Cleveland. It's the closest
I've got to Washington.

15:35.544 --> 15:38.414
There's a woman about to
deliver there, Marlene Finch.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.340
- Fine!
- Her husband's name is Roger, who's an Elk.

15:41.424 --> 15:43.750
- He owns a dry-cl...
- I'll take it!

15:43.844 --> 15:47.129
Oh, OK. She's going into labour!
You'd better hurry.

15:47.222 --> 15:49.298
How will we recognize each other?

15:49.391 --> 15:52.096
Don't worry. Go, go, go!

15:53.353 --> 15:56.804
Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute!

15:57.691 --> 15:59.730
I forgot! Your shot!

15:59.818 --> 16:02.024
You go to... You need... I...

16:02.904 --> 16:05.360
Omar? What happened?

16:05.448 --> 16:07.525
- He had to run.
- He had to run?

16:07.617 --> 16:10.322
And? And what, Omar? And what?

16:10.412 --> 16:12.404
A... a...

16:12.497 --> 16:15.949
And you... forgot to give
him his inoculation?

16:17.085 --> 16:19.457
He can't go through
life without that.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.622
Sally, please...

16:22.174 --> 16:24.296
What if he remembers?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.787
This is a pretty situation!

16:58.877 --> 17:02.376
So you just assumed that
nobody at Yale University

17:02.464 --> 17:05.169
or Yale Law School had any interest

17:05.258 --> 17:08.295
in checking out these six books
in the last three months?

17:08.386 --> 17:09.929
No, I just...

17:10.012 --> 17:12.006
You are going to make some lawyer!

17:16.228 --> 17:20.060
You owe eighty-seven dollars
and twenty-five cents.

17:20.816 --> 17:24.765
87.25. Can I put that
on a credit card?

17:24.861 --> 17:26.901
This isn't a boutique.

17:26.988 --> 17:29.277
Cash only, or we'll
hold up your grades.

17:29.366 --> 17:31.026
I don't have enough cash.

17:31.117 --> 17:35.032
I'm... I'm going home right now
and my ride's waiting for me.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.079
Mrs. Handy? The rare books room.

17:37.165 --> 17:40.083
- The Shakespeare folios.
- Yes, Alex. What about them?

17:40.168 --> 17:42.244
They're fooling with the folios.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.745
- Fooling with the folios?
- And fiddling too.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.916
- Go! Go to them!
- Yes. Thank you.

17:47.008 --> 17:48.918
I'll take over here.

17:50.512 --> 17:53.797
<i>Oh dear Oh! Good heavens</i>

17:54.474 --> 17:56.550
God, is she always that awful?

17:56.643 --> 17:58.386
Mom?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.186
No.

18:00.272 --> 18:02.348
I'm sorry.

18:03.275 --> 18:07.319
I just didn't have enough cash, and
she wouldn't take a credit card.

18:07.404 --> 18:09.859
And... I can't get my grades.

18:09.948 --> 18:12.404
My ride's waiting...

18:12.492 --> 18:13.903
What? What?

18:13.994 --> 18:15.618
This is bad.

18:15.704 --> 18:17.780
- How bad?
- It's worse than I thought.

18:17.873 --> 18:20.031
- How worse?
- A lot.

18:20.125 --> 18:23.825
According to this, these books
were never legally checked out.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.209
Yeah, so?

18:26.298 --> 18:29.501
So it means I can't
charge you for them.

18:29.593 --> 18:31.716
You beat the system.

18:33.889 --> 18:34.920
Yeah.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.761
- Alex.
- Alex?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.599
Miranda.

18:46.443 --> 18:48.732
Thank you. That was
really sweet of you.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.772
Consider it a graduation present.

18:52.199 --> 18:55.733
- I'm not graduating.
- I am. Tomorrow.

18:55.827 --> 18:57.986
Oh, yeah? Congratulations.

18:58.079 --> 18:59.739
I got to go.

18:59.831 --> 19:00.994
OK.

19:03.335 --> 19:04.449
Bye.

19:07.589 --> 19:10.258
- That wasn't really your mother, right?
- No.

19:12.802 --> 19:16.634
- Have a nice life.
- Thanks. You too.

19:21.603 --> 19:25.850
<i>The Today show is here, they're setting
up. We're not ready! It's not working.</i>

19:25.941 --> 19:29.310
Richard, calm down! It's just
the panic before the storm.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.439
Corinne, Eleanor Roosevelt's
wig is missing.

19:32.531 --> 19:35.567
What?! It's got to be here.
I'm sure we'll find it.

19:35.659 --> 19:39.787
- Mamie Eisenhower's hair might work.
- Wrong party. She's a Republican.

19:39.871 --> 19:42.872
- Have you checked Maintenance?
- No. I'm on my way.

19:42.958 --> 19:45.164
<i>Oh! When you go by
the Today show set,</i>

19:45.252 --> 19:48.253
casually see what Willard
Scott has on his head.

19:48.338 --> 19:51.043
- Excuse me. Corinne, telephone.
- I'm not here.

19:51.132 --> 19:53.802
- It's your daughter.
- Oh! I'm here.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.716
<i>- Hello, honey!
- Hi Mom.</i>

19:56.805 --> 19:58.714
Where are you?

19:58.807 --> 20:00.883
I'm on the New Jersey turnpike.

20:00.976 --> 20:03.811
I'm running a little late.
I'll be home for dinner.

20:03.895 --> 20:07.810
Great! Are you alone, or are you
bringing the missing link with you?

20:08.692 --> 20:10.768
Mom, we broke up months ago.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.937
Well, I never thought
he was right for you.

20:13.029 --> 20:15.603
I know. OK. I have to go.

20:15.699 --> 20:17.857
Be careful, sweetheart. Bye-bye.

20:17.951 --> 20:21.285
- You were right! Maintenance had it.
- Great.

20:21.371 --> 20:24.740
- And look what I found.
- What?

20:24.875 --> 20:27.994
Jackie Kennedy's earrings!

20:28.086 --> 20:30.660
They were with the dinosaur teeth.

20:30.755 --> 20:33.922
Inventory got 'em mixed up
when we switched buildings.

20:36.887 --> 20:40.302
<i>Corinne, you should
have been a first lady.</i>

20:43.477 --> 20:45.553
I was, once.

20:47.731 --> 20:49.807
Corinne, can I go?

20:49.900 --> 20:53.150
Sure. I'll see you
tomorrow morning at six.

20:53.236 --> 20:57.732
Six? This is the opening of an
exhibit, not... a dairy farm.

20:59.493 --> 21:02.363
You're right. I'll see
you at six thirty.

21:03.079 --> 21:05.155
Six thirty.

21:17.219 --> 21:20.670
- Good night, Joe. See you, John.
- Ms. Jeffries.

21:38.657 --> 21:40.566
Hi, handsome.

21:56.091 --> 22:00.669
I'm having those dreams again.
The X-rated ones with Louie.

22:00.762 --> 22:04.974
- Dr. Bailey, you'd be shocked.
- What else? How have you been feeling?

22:05.058 --> 22:08.225
Fantastic. It was Louie's
birthday on Saturday.

22:08.311 --> 22:10.802
I baked him a cake with
little cherries in it.

22:11.273 --> 22:16.184
I thought we agreed that you were
going to stop cooking for Louie.

22:17.195 --> 22:19.271
It was his birthday.

22:20.198 --> 22:22.736
It makes me happy to feed him.

22:24.035 --> 22:25.945
<i>The Egyptians fed their dead.</i>

22:26.705 --> 22:29.243
Not after 23 years.

22:30.876 --> 22:32.952
Now, when you first came to me

22:33.044 --> 22:39.546
you told me that you wanted to free
yourself from your attachment to Louie.

22:39.634 --> 22:44.711
That you wanted to move on, that you
wanted to experience love again.

22:46.474 --> 22:48.763
And we agreed that that meant

22:49.352 --> 22:52.686
a fruitful relationship with a man

22:52.772 --> 22:54.848
who has a body.

22:56.359 --> 22:58.566
Now, can you do that much, Corinne?

22:58.653 --> 23:02.947
Can you refrain from these
activities that, uh

23:03.533 --> 23:05.858
perpetuate your fantasy?

23:06.286 --> 23:08.029
I'll try.

23:16.755 --> 23:20.835
Here's your favorite... Peppermint
Patty. Good night!

23:21.843 --> 23:26.304
<i>He raised a gull-like
cry in the air.</i>

23:26.389 --> 23:29.474
Thar she blows!

23:30.018 --> 23:32.853
Thar she blows!

23:32.938 --> 23:35.310
A hump like a snow hill!

23:35.941 --> 23:38.313
It is Moby Dick!

24:14.604 --> 24:16.644
<i>♪ I liked it so much better. ♪</i>

24:16.731 --> 24:18.771
<i>♪ From the day I said goodbye. ♪</i>

24:18.859 --> 24:22.903
<i>♪ And I tell myself I'm free. ♪</i>

24:22.988 --> 24:26.024
<i>♪ But I'm only fooling me. ♪</i>

24:26.867 --> 24:30.615
<i>♪ Cos no matter what I do. ♪</i>

24:30.704 --> 24:32.780
<i>♪ I can't get over you. ♪</i>

24:37.085 --> 24:40.169
A Mr. Alex Finch to see Mr. Bradlee.

24:51.266 --> 24:53.259
Mr. Bradlee doesn't
know who you are.

24:53.351 --> 24:55.842
- I'm sure he would recognize me if...
- I'm sorry.

24:55.937 --> 24:58.179
- May I help you?
- Can I... try him one...?

25:00.692 --> 25:02.850
Goodbye.

25:10.785 --> 25:13.455
Excuse me. I was wondering
if Mr. Bradlee...?

25:13.538 --> 25:16.208
I have a delivery for Mr. Bradlee.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.916
Hi, there. Morning.

26:50.135 --> 26:52.211
Oh, good. You're here.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.928
Thanks.

26:54.723 --> 26:56.799
Who the hell are you?

26:59.060 --> 27:01.136
I met you at Yale,
sir, where I went.

27:01.229 --> 27:04.598
You gave a lecture and you told
me to look you up when I got out.

27:04.691 --> 27:08.274
I just got out yesterday, and here
I am! I want to be a reporter.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.069
How'd you get up here?

27:10.155 --> 27:12.527
The elevator, sir. I...
I came up...

27:12.616 --> 27:15.782
With me. He came up with me.
It's my very good friend...

27:15.911 --> 27:17.654
Alex Finch.

27:17.746 --> 27:21.790
I... I was editor of the
Yale Daily News and.

27:21.875 --> 27:24.283
I was a stringer for
two years for Time

27:24.377 --> 27:27.378
and I can start tonight.
Now. Two hours ago.

27:27.464 --> 27:31.877
He's very hot. He's... He could be
our next Woodward and Bernstein.

27:31.968 --> 27:34.376
Well, at least talk to him, Ben.

27:34.888 --> 27:36.964
OK, Finch. Wait outside.

27:37.057 --> 27:39.133
Right!

27:39.226 --> 27:41.302
Thank you.

27:58.370 --> 28:00.446
Mr. Bradlee will see you now.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.041
I'm sorry, Finch.

28:05.126 --> 28:07.962
But did you read the one about
the kitchen workers' strike?

28:08.046 --> 28:11.581
If I hired you, the guys in this
office would eat you for breakfast.

28:12.884 --> 28:16.419
Believe me, you need
experience. Contacts.

28:16.513 --> 28:18.552
Find work on a small-town paper.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.934
Then, when you've paid your
dues, know your way around,

28:23.019 --> 28:25.095
gimme a call.

28:25.897 --> 28:27.439
OK.

28:29.651 --> 28:32.023
Thanks anyway.

28:39.119 --> 28:41.906
Bradlee doesn't know everything.

28:41.997 --> 28:44.073
- Hi. Philip Train.
- Hi.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.288
Philip Train...

28:46.376 --> 28:48.867
Pulitzer Prize, 1979.

28:48.962 --> 28:50.290
Wow.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.334
Listen, I'm about to get a cab.
Can I drop you anywhere?

28:53.425 --> 28:55.667
I have a car.
I can give you a ride.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.836
I'd be honored. Sir.

29:06.771 --> 29:09.523
I've lived in
Washington all my life.

29:09.608 --> 29:13.855
With the exception of six months
in Bolivia. I married a tin heiress.

29:13.945 --> 29:17.065
Can't remember why.
She used to call me Peeleep.

29:19.117 --> 29:21.988
Anyway, I just got out
of mistake number two.

29:22.078 --> 29:24.118
Why don't you turn left up here?

29:24.873 --> 29:26.866
Sorry.

29:31.004 --> 29:34.455
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Dinner?

29:37.052 --> 29:40.836
You're coming with me. My friends
live just down the street.

30:02.410 --> 30:03.655
Coming?

30:04.830 --> 30:06.075
Yeah.

30:14.005 --> 30:16.081
Hello, hello, hello!

30:22.180 --> 30:25.632
- Nobody home.
- God, this is a nice house!

30:25.725 --> 30:27.801
Hi, Philip.

30:27.894 --> 30:30.101
Hello, honey. Meet my friend,

30:30.188 --> 30:32.097
- Alex...
- You!

30:32.190 --> 30:33.982
- Miranda!
- Finch.

30:34.442 --> 30:36.519
I don't believe this.

30:36.611 --> 30:38.937
This is incredible.

30:39.030 --> 30:40.774
Do you two know each other?

30:44.494 --> 30:48.444
Someone should start dinner.
I'll do it.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.865
- Get him a drink!
- Come in.

30:50.959 --> 30:52.239
OK.

30:54.296 --> 30:57.581
- What are you doing here?
- I came down to get a job at the Post.

30:57.674 --> 31:00.046
- Well, how'd it go?
- Terribly.

31:00.468 --> 31:03.304
But... things are...
definitely picking up.

31:06.725 --> 31:09.679
So I started today. I'm
interning for this judge.

31:09.769 --> 31:11.513
That's great.

31:11.605 --> 31:14.724
- First in her class in law school.
- Philip...

31:14.816 --> 31:16.394
Second.

31:16.485 --> 31:18.561
Skipped high school entirely.

31:18.653 --> 31:20.445
Skipped a year.

31:22.407 --> 31:24.732
<i>- I'm home!
- We're out here.</i>

31:27.829 --> 31:30.534
- Mom!
- Sweetheart!

31:33.376 --> 31:35.452
Philip, that smells delicious!

31:35.545 --> 31:38.712
Sorry I'm late, but we've been
looking for Dolly Madison's arm.

31:38.798 --> 31:41.634
- Poke holes in 'em, otherwise they explode.
- Sorry, Mom!

31:41.718 --> 31:43.545
Mom? This is Alex Finch.

31:43.637 --> 31:45.713
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi.

31:45.805 --> 31:47.715
Have we met before?

31:47.807 --> 31:51.508
- I don't... think so.
- He's staying for dinner. He's homeless.

31:51.603 --> 31:54.011
Oh! Wonderful.

31:54.105 --> 31:56.643
I'll go change and be right back.

31:56.733 --> 32:00.184
- She's a curator at the Smithsonian.
- And your dad?

32:00.278 --> 32:02.354
He died before I was born.

32:02.948 --> 32:06.281
- Sorry.
- And Philip's my godfather.

32:07.536 --> 32:09.694
He's your mother's boyfriend?

32:09.788 --> 32:13.239
No! No.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.916
Well, unfortunately, my mother
never really got over my father.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.079
Look at this. Come here.

32:21.716 --> 32:23.590
That's my dad.

32:41.945 --> 32:44.780
<i>Miranda where's that corn?</i>

33:02.465 --> 33:04.838
So what kind of lawyer
do you want to be?

33:04.926 --> 33:06.670
A public defender.

33:06.761 --> 33:09.003
Supreme Court justice!

33:11.433 --> 33:13.224
I like to fight.

33:15.604 --> 33:18.095
Oh, honey, you'd better
get some more ice.

33:18.190 --> 33:20.431
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.143
Thanks, Alex.

33:24.821 --> 33:26.695
- So what do you think?
- I like him.

33:44.216 --> 33:46.292
Philip!

33:50.931 --> 33:53.504
<i>I think we'll call the tree George.</i>

33:55.143 --> 33:57.599
Now, aren't they beautiful?

34:05.111 --> 34:08.315
That... that didn't happen.
That's right.

34:09.783 --> 34:12.534
My bowl! What's that doing here?

34:13.536 --> 34:18.875
"Corinne Randolph and Louis Jeffries,
joined in holy matrimony, May 18th, 1963."

34:18.958 --> 34:24.629
<i>Do you Louis Jeffries take Corinne
Randolph to be your lawful wedded wife?</i>

34:25.507 --> 34:27.049
Shit!

34:27.132 --> 34:29.541
What a coincidence.

34:29.636 --> 34:31.427
That's a coincidence.

34:31.513 --> 34:33.589
That's a coincidence.

34:34.391 --> 34:36.549
Uncle Marsh!

34:36.643 --> 34:40.688
Who the hell's Uncle Marsh?
Who is he?

34:41.857 --> 34:43.933
"John Marshall Jeffries."

34:54.034 --> 34:55.779
Oh, good.

34:55.871 --> 34:57.947
<i>- Alex?
- Hold on!</i>

35:07.841 --> 35:09.335
- Corn?
- Thank you.

35:23.899 --> 35:27.065
Oh, honey, would you get the
little silver corn holders?

35:27.152 --> 35:29.109
What corn holders?

35:29.196 --> 35:31.865
It's in the sideboard.
Second drawer on the right.

35:41.166 --> 35:42.993
So they are!

35:43.084 --> 35:45.410
Good guess.

35:51.218 --> 35:54.218
So tell me, Alex, what
does your father do?

36:00.519 --> 36:02.262
Al-ex!

36:05.273 --> 36:09.900
Oh, he runs a dry-cleaning establishment.
It's called Finch's Easy-Clean.

36:09.986 --> 36:13.651
And he specializes mostly in
goose down and suede and,

36:13.740 --> 36:18.236
you know, fine fabrics, but he's thinking
about expanding into fur storage.

36:18.328 --> 36:20.451
I said, "Dad, that's
not a good idea",

36:20.539 --> 36:23.243
because you don't have... the...

36:23.917 --> 36:25.411
"experience."

36:32.384 --> 36:34.092
<i>Come on Louie!</i>

36:34.177 --> 36:35.375
<i>OK</i>

36:39.558 --> 36:41.182
Alex?

36:44.146 --> 36:46.019
Peekaboo!

36:46.106 --> 36:48.395
Easy on the vino, pal!

36:49.401 --> 36:51.477
Is everything all right?

36:51.570 --> 36:53.527
Excuse me.

37:20.473 --> 37:22.300
<i>Louie!</i>

37:23.602 --> 37:25.843
Oh, my God.

37:25.937 --> 37:28.013
I'm Louie Jeffries!

37:28.732 --> 37:30.808
I was Louie Jeffries!

37:32.527 --> 37:35.197
That means that that
lady's my wife.

37:36.156 --> 37:38.943
And Miranda... oh,
God, I kissed her!

37:39.034 --> 37:41.240
And Philip... my best friend.

37:42.204 --> 37:44.327
Philip...

37:45.290 --> 37:47.615
<i>- Yeah?
- Everything OK in there?</i>

37:47.709 --> 37:49.251
Yes.

37:56.051 --> 37:58.720
Philip. It's great
to see you again!

38:02.349 --> 38:04.425
<i>It's... great to see you.</i>

38:12.484 --> 38:14.560
Excuse me.

38:15.779 --> 38:18.531
Well...! I hope it
wasn't my cooking.

38:26.832 --> 38:30.699
Car keys, maps,
Corinne's sunglasses, and

38:33.255 --> 38:35.331
light bulbs.

39:03.827 --> 39:05.903
It's my car.

39:05.996 --> 39:08.451
It's my car.

39:09.291 --> 39:12.457
- Great! It's my car.
- Alex!

39:12.544 --> 39:14.620
Alex?

39:15.797 --> 39:20.839
My deodorant. There's my mouthwash.
There's my books...

39:20.927 --> 39:23.299
It's mine. It's all mine.

39:23.388 --> 39:26.804
Whoa! Come on. It's all right.

39:26.892 --> 39:28.968
Come down.

39:35.817 --> 39:38.937
Watch your step, we're going up.
That's it...

39:39.029 --> 39:42.065
Honey, do you really think it's
safe for him to stay here?

39:42.157 --> 39:45.193
All those things he was saying,
all that running around!

39:45.285 --> 39:48.903
He's had a rough day. He's
just a little stressed.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.366
Trust me.

39:54.461 --> 39:57.830
OK. But make sure your
bedroom door is locked.

40:08.350 --> 40:10.223
Towels.

40:14.147 --> 40:17.350
Are you sure that it's all right,
me staying here the night?

40:17.442 --> 40:19.767
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

40:20.529 --> 40:22.854
I'm sorry I ruined
the dinner party.

40:25.659 --> 40:27.735
You didn't mess it up.

40:28.829 --> 40:30.905
You brought it to life.

40:40.715 --> 40:42.044
Miranda...

40:42.133 --> 40:44.210
Yeah?

40:46.137 --> 40:48.214
Have you had a happy life?

40:50.100 --> 40:52.176
Yeah. I guess so.

40:53.270 --> 40:57.018
Is there anything you wanted
that you haven't had?

40:57.107 --> 40:58.898
My father.

41:01.403 --> 41:03.479
He was a pretty great guy, huh?

41:04.865 --> 41:07.237
That's what they tell me.

41:08.285 --> 41:10.657
God, you sure have grown up nicely!

41:13.498 --> 41:15.574
I'm glad you approve.

41:18.628 --> 41:19.791
Good night!

41:23.258 --> 41:25.085
Night.

41:34.269 --> 41:37.021
Hi. I love the suit!
You shouldn't have.

41:37.105 --> 41:41.269
- I wanted to. Your first power suit!
- Mom...!

41:41.359 --> 41:43.435
Don't let Alex go anywhere.

41:43.528 --> 41:48.274
I'll lock him in the tower with the other
boyfriends who are trying to get away!

41:49.367 --> 41:51.159
Love you.

42:22.025 --> 42:25.857
- Morning.
- I didn't think anyone was home. I'm sor...

42:27.531 --> 42:29.903
Well, I'm running a little late.

42:31.201 --> 42:35.246
- How are you feelin'?
- I'm not quite myself, but I'm OK.

42:35.330 --> 42:37.406
I, uh... I've... I've...

42:38.667 --> 42:39.698
Yes?

42:39.793 --> 42:41.335
I, uh...

42:41.419 --> 42:43.329
I love orange juice!

42:43.421 --> 42:45.461
I'm so glad.

42:49.553 --> 42:53.004
I, uh... I... I bet your husband
was a real orange juice man.

42:53.515 --> 42:56.848
Yes, he was. He was
generally fond of fruit.

42:56.935 --> 43:00.055
- Excuse me!
- He was handsome and witty too, I understand.

43:00.147 --> 43:02.638
I mean, I... a man of high ideals.

43:03.567 --> 43:06.651
Yes. He was all those things.

43:09.030 --> 43:12.316
Oh, uh... Miranda
left these for you.

43:12.409 --> 43:16.323
You should help yourself to anything
to eat, and make yourself at home.

43:16.413 --> 43:18.619
OK.

43:19.791 --> 43:21.535
Excuse me.

44:16.515 --> 44:19.634
<i>Dreaming of Louie every
night this week.</i>

44:19.726 --> 44:22.893
<i>My psychiatrist says I
suffer from the halo effect</i>

44:22.979 --> 44:26.479
<i>the tendency of widows to
idealize their dead husbands.</i>

44:26.566 --> 44:29.437
<i>He says it keeps me from
falling in love again.</i>

44:29.528 --> 44:34.154
<i>He has a point but I can't imagine
I'll ever stop loving Louie.</i>

44:58.014 --> 44:59.046
Cor-anda!

45:02.227 --> 45:06.059
Corinne, you're never gonna
believe this, but...

45:06.148 --> 45:09.599
Miranda, this may come as
a shock to you, but...

45:18.702 --> 45:20.778
- Morning.
- Morning.

45:20.871 --> 45:24.655
- I'm here to see Mrs. Jeffries.
- She's in a meeting. Are you the caterer?

45:24.749 --> 45:27.323
No. I'm... an old friend.

45:27.961 --> 45:31.081
Oh. Just have a seat.
She won't be long.

45:31.590 --> 45:32.965
Thanks.

45:34.050 --> 45:38.095
<i>Corinne I've developed the fine
art of reading between the lips</i>

45:38.180 --> 45:41.216
<i>and I see nothing but
budget cuts on the horizon.</i>

45:41.308 --> 45:43.846
<i>No-one is happy about it.</i>

45:43.935 --> 45:48.763
<i>They won't bend the rules this
time my dear Not even for you.</i>

45:48.857 --> 45:53.068
It is eight hours before the opening and
you're telling me they want to fire me?

45:53.153 --> 45:55.988
Corinne, we are two million
dollars in the hole.

45:56.072 --> 45:58.646
And it was you who
insisted... and I quote...

45:58.742 --> 46:02.360
"The American people maintain
an insatiable curiosity"

46:02.454 --> 46:04.577
about that eclectic group of women

46:04.664 --> 46:08.283
who fashioned everything from
foreign policy to hemlines at home.

46:08.376 --> 46:09.456
I still believe that.

46:09.544 --> 46:12.297
We still have to pay
back the emergency fund

46:12.323 --> 46:15.074
so another department
can have an emergency.

46:15.133 --> 46:17.589
- I know that!
- By Friday.

46:17.677 --> 46:20.881
Friday? But it's Wednesday.
That's impossible!

46:20.972 --> 46:25.136
Now look, you remember that friend
of mine who I hate, Mavis Talmadge?

46:25.227 --> 46:27.599
- Yes...
- Well, tonight at the opening,

46:27.687 --> 46:30.143
I want you to put the
squeeze on old Mavis.

46:30.232 --> 46:31.726
Why can't you?

46:31.817 --> 46:34.771
Mavis Talmadge is not someone
I'd care to squeeze.

46:35.403 --> 46:38.357
No-one in Washington
is as rich as Mavis.

46:38.448 --> 46:42.197
She's her own corporation,
her own... landmass.

46:42.702 --> 46:46.949
Now, Corinne, Mavis
Talmadge is the way to go.

46:48.750 --> 46:51.412
I don't want to bother her
and I don't feel well,

46:51.438 --> 46:53.567
so I'll just come
back some other time.

46:53.630 --> 46:55.421
Alex!

46:55.507 --> 46:57.381
Hi.

46:57.467 --> 46:59.674
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

47:00.428 --> 47:04.758
I wish you'd told me you were coming.
I could have arranged for a private tour.

47:04.850 --> 47:06.260
Come on in.

47:08.353 --> 47:10.559
This is gonna sound
a little funny, but

47:10.647 --> 47:13.683
I didn't come to see the museum.
I came here to see you.

47:13.775 --> 47:17.987
I hope you didn't come all the way down
here to apologise about last night.

47:19.114 --> 47:21.486
No, I came to talk
about something else.

47:25.662 --> 47:27.322
I'm Louie.

47:27.414 --> 47:28.576
What?

47:29.833 --> 47:31.790
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.

47:32.335 --> 47:36.000
You're not gonna believe me, but
there's something you should know.

47:37.257 --> 47:38.835
All right.

47:46.308 --> 47:50.519
Our rainforests are being destroyed
at a rate of 50 acres a minute!

47:53.815 --> 47:55.891
Alex, do you want to borrow money?

47:58.862 --> 48:00.771
Is this about Miranda?

48:01.531 --> 48:03.358
In part.

48:05.619 --> 48:09.866
Alex, I'm really sorry, but I have
a lunch date in a few minutes.

48:11.374 --> 48:13.201
Look into my eyes.

48:13.877 --> 48:15.953
Does anything seem familiar?

48:17.005 --> 48:19.294
- I beg your pardon?
- It's me.

48:19.883 --> 48:21.543
Louie.

48:22.969 --> 48:25.045
I'm back.

48:26.181 --> 48:30.095
I wasn't drunk last night at
dinner, and when I saw you

48:30.393 --> 48:32.469
and I saw the house,

48:32.813 --> 48:35.434
my memory came back
of my last life.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.773
- What are you talking about?
- With you!

48:41.488 --> 48:45.355
I got my memory back and
I realised... that I was Louie.

48:46.993 --> 48:49.069
I am Louie!

48:49.996 --> 48:52.072
I got recycled.

48:58.463 --> 49:00.539
You look great, by the way.

49:05.345 --> 49:09.094
Hey, I know it's hard to believe.
I mean, I... can't...

49:12.853 --> 49:14.596
Try to see.

49:15.230 --> 49:17.306
Get out of my office.

49:25.157 --> 49:26.948
Corinne...

49:27.033 --> 49:28.314
Get out.

49:55.729 --> 49:57.805
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi.

50:01.443 --> 50:04.479
- How are you? Feeling better?
- Yeah. Can we sit down and...?

50:04.571 --> 50:07.192
- I talked to Bradlee this afternoon.
- Yeah?

50:07.282 --> 50:08.942
About you.

50:10.285 --> 50:13.120
Bottom line is, he
won't hire a rookie.

50:13.205 --> 50:16.040
- But I've got some friends, editors.
- Philip,

50:16.124 --> 50:20.537
why are you going out of your way
for me? I mean, you hardly know me.

50:20.629 --> 50:22.538
I don't know.

50:23.381 --> 50:26.466
Maybe it's like... with
someone special...

50:26.551 --> 50:29.559
You know that feeling that
you have like a confidant,

50:29.585 --> 50:31.534
or maybe, you know, a best friend?

50:31.598 --> 50:33.804
You want a beer?

50:37.062 --> 50:38.521
Sure.

50:58.750 --> 51:01.446
Miranda's left molar.
That's my Miranda file.

51:01.472 --> 51:02.643
It's beautiful.

51:02.712 --> 51:04.670
You really do like her, dontcha?

51:04.756 --> 51:07.045
You look like a family.

51:07.133 --> 51:08.960
Well, we are, almost.

51:09.052 --> 51:13.381
Just without, uh... some of the usual
conventions of marriage... sex.

51:16.935 --> 51:21.264
So, uh... you and Mrs. Jeffries
have never been together?

51:22.149 --> 51:24.474
- No.
- But you love her.

51:24.568 --> 51:26.726
Hopelessly.

51:27.737 --> 51:33.112
And all these years you've never
touched her and you've never told her?

51:38.248 --> 51:42.661
You don't know Corinne... she's wired
differently. She's not like other women.

51:42.752 --> 51:46.999
The slightest push in the
wrong direction might...

51:47.090 --> 51:48.834
I don't want to rush her.

51:48.925 --> 51:51.297
I think you've done
the right thing.

51:51.386 --> 51:57.259
Well, I've tried to take care of Miranda and
Corinne the way I imagine Louie would've.

51:57.350 --> 51:59.806
That's Louie. With the skinny legs.

51:59.895 --> 52:01.768
Not that skinny.

52:06.526 --> 52:09.729
Philip. You're not
gonna believe this,

52:10.614 --> 52:12.690
but...

52:12.782 --> 52:14.859
Um, sorry. Excuse me.

52:19.164 --> 52:21.240
Hello? Oh, hi.

52:22.209 --> 52:24.000
Research.

52:24.085 --> 52:25.995
I'd better go.

52:26.087 --> 52:27.416
Thanks.

52:47.317 --> 52:49.393
Oh, my God.

52:53.657 --> 52:55.733
This your first time as a human?

52:56.660 --> 52:57.691
What?

52:58.745 --> 53:01.117
I'm getting a strong

53:01.331 --> 53:03.573
German shepherd vibration.

53:05.168 --> 53:08.668
Uh... I used to be a lawyer.

53:09.005 --> 53:11.081
Oh. Close!

53:15.512 --> 53:17.588
Do you know about past lives?

53:17.681 --> 53:22.426
We're all connected... it's all
connected. Under the skin.

53:22.519 --> 53:25.769
You never know who's
lurking in what body.

53:26.690 --> 53:29.560
Your wife could be
your grandfather.

53:29.651 --> 53:33.863
You meet some guy who gets on your nerves,
it's probably your mother-in-law!

53:33.947 --> 53:37.897
We keep meeting the souls
we're attached to,

53:37.993 --> 53:41.860
for better or worse,
life after life.

53:42.581 --> 53:47.373
Sometimes I wonder why I worry
about past lives at all.

53:49.212 --> 53:52.213
I'm having so much
trouble with this one!

53:53.842 --> 53:57.507
When you remember your
past lives, it's like

53:58.763 --> 54:01.764
your emotions get spread,

54:02.309 --> 54:04.597
like a dangling nerve,

54:04.686 --> 54:07.094
all over the map.

54:07.189 --> 54:09.228
It makes it very hard to live.

54:10.442 --> 54:12.351
I know.

54:13.153 --> 54:14.861
Who were you?

54:14.946 --> 54:17.272
Oh, me? I was no-one special.

54:17.365 --> 54:19.524
Oh, we're all special.

54:19.618 --> 54:23.236
I mean, I wasn't Cleopatra or
Hannibal or someone great or famous.

54:24.748 --> 54:27.239
Well, I know you weren't Cleopatra.

54:27.334 --> 54:29.207
I was!

54:31.755 --> 54:33.913
I don't want him in this house!

54:34.007 --> 54:38.468
Mom, you don't make any sense. Why all
of a sudden does he have to leave?

54:38.553 --> 54:40.795
I have my reasons.
End of conversation.

54:40.889 --> 54:43.843
What do you mean, "end of conversation"?
What's he done?

54:43.934 --> 54:45.725
He's...

54:45.811 --> 54:46.478
weird.

54:46.504 --> 54:49.169
Mom, weirdness is not
a criminal offense.

54:49.231 --> 54:51.804
If it were, you'd be
serving a life sentence!

54:51.900 --> 54:55.601
Miranda, we don't know a thing
about him. He's a stray off the street.

54:55.695 --> 54:57.771
- He could be a...
- Yale grad!

54:58.907 --> 55:02.490
Look, once again I like someone
of whom you don't approve,

55:02.577 --> 55:05.448
for your own peculiar and
inexplicable reasons.

55:05.539 --> 55:08.575
So you order him out like some
Latin American generalissimo.

55:09.543 --> 55:11.831
<i>Where's my life in all this?</i>

55:11.920 --> 55:14.328
I'm sick and tired of
trying to find someone

55:14.422 --> 55:17.459
who fits into your notion
of Mr. Right! He's not Daddy.

55:19.010 --> 55:20.505
Nobody is.

55:20.595 --> 55:24.842
He's leaving and that's final. Now,
you go right downstairs and tell him!

55:25.600 --> 55:27.427
You tell him.

55:27.561 --> 55:30.016
All right...

55:30.105 --> 55:31.896
I will!

55:40.407 --> 55:42.115
Alex...

55:44.619 --> 55:46.695
- Alex!
- Mom...

55:50.250 --> 55:52.456
You look fabulous in Daddy's tux.

55:59.384 --> 56:01.175
I'll get the car, Mom.

56:52.062 --> 56:55.762
Oh, the first ladies were so
fascinating as individuals!

56:55.857 --> 56:57.933
Lou Hoover was a shot put champion,

56:58.026 --> 57:01.644
a geology major at Stanford
and an accomplished linguist.

57:01.738 --> 57:05.866
She and Herbert used to
converse in Chinese.

57:05.951 --> 57:07.250
This is Lady Bird.

57:07.776 --> 57:10.970
Southern Democrats were furious with
LBJ for his stand on civil rights,

57:11.039 --> 57:13.910
so he sent his wife down
South to campaign for him,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.228
knowing that no southern
gentleman could refuse

57:16.254 --> 57:18.718
to greet a southern lady...
and it worked!

57:18.880 --> 57:20.624
Fascinatin'.

57:30.892 --> 57:32.636
Something the matter?

57:32.727 --> 57:35.847
No! Eleanor Roosevelt is
my favorite first lady.

57:35.939 --> 57:39.604
She wore this gown the night of
the president's inauguration.

57:39.693 --> 57:42.100
There was a concert
at Constitution Hall!

57:43.613 --> 57:45.238
We want the people to know

57:45.323 --> 57:49.535
that the first ladies were more than
just their china and their dresses.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.076
Oh, thank you!

57:58.211 --> 58:00.287
Aren't you going to introduce us?

58:00.380 --> 58:04.045
Mrs. Talmadge, this is Alex Finch,
a friend of my daughter's.

58:04.134 --> 58:05.462
Mr. Finch.

58:05.552 --> 58:08.921
- Oh!
- May I have this dance?

58:10.140 --> 58:12.216
Here.

58:14.394 --> 58:17.312
- May I have this dance?
- Philip...!

58:55.811 --> 58:57.887
Where are we going?

58:57.979 --> 59:00.553
I take it it's something
urgent and top-secret?

59:00.649 --> 59:03.603
- It's very important for me.
- Right!

59:04.194 --> 59:07.111
Do you think it's possible...
for Louie to come back?

59:07.197 --> 59:10.862
Oh, Corinne! We're not going
to go to another seance.

59:11.368 --> 59:14.369
No, no! I mean, in
another person's body.

59:16.331 --> 59:19.332
I have no idea. But
somehow I don't think so.

59:19.417 --> 59:23.415
- Why are we discussing this now?
- It's a very interesting question.

59:23.505 --> 59:26.210
Well, let's ask
Mrs. Lincoln. Mary...

59:26.299 --> 59:29.051
- Philip, I'm serious!
- Well, so am I.

59:29.719 --> 59:34.381
Corinne, I can understand how a person's
desires might lead her to believe that.

59:34.474 --> 59:36.550
It would be a dream come true.

59:36.643 --> 59:40.855
But the last guy to come back that
I know about was Jesus Christ.

59:42.274 --> 59:44.350
You'll see Louie some day.

59:46.319 --> 59:48.775
I know. In heaven.

59:51.825 --> 59:53.782
Philip!

59:57.247 --> 01:00:01.624
Why don't you find yourself a girlfriend?
You're so good-looking.

01:00:04.504 --> 01:00:06.995
So we're in agreement,
Miss Talmadge?

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.166
- Mavis.
- Mavis.

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:12.130
That America's first ladies
deserve a place in history

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.343
as much as some of the
dopes they married.

01:00:14.431 --> 01:00:17.432
Sure, they had the official power.

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:21.645
<i>But the real power lies behind the
scenes. With women. Like you.</i>

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:24.517
Two million dollars
will save this exhibit,

01:00:24.608 --> 01:00:28.107
and the whole world will
discover America's first ladies

01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:31.065
in the all-new Mavis
Talmadge Pavilion!

01:00:48.673 --> 01:00:52.042
<i>An excellent choice and
happy anniversary!</i>

01:01:00.393 --> 01:01:02.766
There you are! Dance with me.

01:01:02.854 --> 01:01:07.101
- Oh, no. I'm a lousy dancer.
- No, you've just never had the right partner.

01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:25.157
- Where did you learn to dance like that?
- Inherited it from my dad.

01:01:53.113 --> 01:01:55.236
They're supposed to be down.

01:01:59.744 --> 01:02:01.737
Now you're mine!

01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:19.399
Mavis!

01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:21.115
My goodness!

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:22.779
Mrs. Talmadge?

01:03:24.329 --> 01:03:27.745
- Is there a doctor in the ballroom?
- Alex!

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.909
Still ticking.

01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:35.629
Move back, everyone,
please! Get back!

01:03:35.715 --> 01:03:37.791
Mrs. Talmadge? Oh, my God!

01:04:05.495 --> 01:04:07.784
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:13.002
- I hope she's all right.
- Oh, she's fine. She's got a strong spirit.

01:04:13.086 --> 01:04:16.537
What are you talking about?
I mean, she's practically dead.

01:04:16.631 --> 01:04:18.790
Oh, but that's just her body.

01:04:18.884 --> 01:04:20.960
Which, let's face it,
is no big loss.

01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:23.674
- In the long run...
- What are you talking about?

01:04:23.763 --> 01:04:26.764
She'll come back. People
do, again and again.

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:29.851
For instance, I could have
been someone you knew before.

01:04:29.936 --> 01:04:32.095
- Yeah.
- Someone that... you loved.

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:35.356
Let's go.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:39.401
I could have been your... father.

01:04:56.713 --> 01:04:59.286
- I have to talk to you.
- Get... get... get off me!

01:04:59.382 --> 01:05:02.716
Only if you promise to listen
to what I have to say!

01:05:08.058 --> 01:05:10.134
Don't break that! It was Father's.

01:05:13.814 --> 01:05:17.017
No! No! I'll... Good
night, good night.

01:05:17.108 --> 01:05:19.267
You win. Good night.

01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:21.567
Just relax. I'll leave.

01:05:24.908 --> 01:05:27.577
I'm sorry, but this is important.

01:05:28.203 --> 01:05:31.239
I had a pair of diamond earrings
with me the day I died.

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:34.118
They were for you.
For our anniversary.

01:05:35.377 --> 01:05:37.453
How do you know about those?

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:40.831
I bought 'em from Mr. Zellerbach!
How do you think I know?

01:05:40.924 --> 01:05:42.501
I know everything
about you, darling.

01:05:42.527 --> 01:05:45.196
I know that you love
peanut butter and rhubarb.

01:05:45.262 --> 01:05:47.966
You're a psychic or one of
those kooks. A spoon-bender!

01:05:48.056 --> 01:05:50.594
- No. You love Johnny Mathis!
- Get out of here,

01:05:50.684 --> 01:05:53.803
before I scream so loud the
whole neighborhood shows up

01:05:53.895 --> 01:05:56.682
and I have you arrested for
impersonating a person!

01:05:56.773 --> 01:05:59.976
And I know you did the Watusi
before Lucy Baines, remember?

01:06:00.068 --> 01:06:02.144
Remember this?

01:06:18.753 --> 01:06:20.829
Good night.

01:06:26.011 --> 01:06:28.087
Oh. I forgot.

01:06:29.723 --> 01:06:31.799
This is for you.

01:07:32.202 --> 01:07:33.744
Louie?

01:09:26.441 --> 01:09:28.185
Louie!

01:09:29.569 --> 01:09:31.645
Are you OK?

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.276
Corinne!

01:09:44.835 --> 01:09:46.911
Corinne!

01:09:47.837 --> 01:09:50.210
<i>- What's the matter?
- Down here.</i>

01:09:52.716 --> 01:09:54.793
OK. What?

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.008
<i>I haven't done it in 23 years.</i>

01:09:59.558 --> 01:10:01.634
Wha...?!

01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:04.937
That's... that, that's... it's OK.

01:10:05.021 --> 01:10:08.889
It's like riding a bike. You never...
You never... forget.

01:10:08.984 --> 01:10:11.557
You know... Don't worry. Corinne!

01:10:15.198 --> 01:10:18.365
Baby, can you please...
open this door?

01:10:18.451 --> 01:10:20.574
Because I'm really... uh...

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.156
Oh, God...

01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:27.450
<i>Good night.</i>

01:10:27.544 --> 01:10:29.620
Good night.

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.839
Oh, damn!

01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:54.611
- Hiya, darling.
- Shhh! Mom's next door.

01:10:56.865 --> 01:11:00.316
- What are you doing here?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.070
Miranda...

01:11:02.162 --> 01:11:04.831
- What?
- It's way past your bedtime.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.541
- Go to your room!
- What is wrong with you?

01:11:09.794 --> 01:11:11.752
Is it me?

01:11:11.838 --> 01:11:15.005
<i>No, it's not you. I mean, yes,
it's you, but it's not you you.</i>

01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:19.469
- Look, if you're not interested...
- I am interested. I'm very interested.

01:11:19.554 --> 01:11:23.848
It's not that I'm not
interested. It's...

01:11:24.267 --> 01:11:26.675
Well, is there someone else?

01:11:28.438 --> 01:11:30.810
- Huh?
- Yeah.

01:11:35.403 --> 01:11:37.111
God!

01:11:38.073 --> 01:11:40.196
Just... pretend this didn't happen.

01:11:40.909 --> 01:11:42.487
OK.

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:47.747
God!

01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:55.588
Louie!

01:12:57.736 --> 01:12:59.693
Good morning!

01:12:59.779 --> 01:13:01.856
Morning.

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:09.036
I thought we could have a picnic
today in the Mall. Maybe...

01:13:09.562 --> 01:13:11.638
take in the Lincoln Memorial.

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:13.535
Maybe, uh...

01:13:15.378 --> 01:13:17.620
I can't. I mean,
I have to work tomorrow.

01:13:17.714 --> 01:13:20.798
And I have this trial to sit in on,
and I just don't have time.

01:13:20.884 --> 01:13:22.047
It'd be fun.

01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:24.211
Sorry.

01:13:24.304 --> 01:13:26.178
Well, maybe some other time.

01:13:26.264 --> 01:13:29.099
- Maybe... yeah.
- Maybe.

01:13:31.144 --> 01:13:33.267
Thanks for thinking of me.

01:13:35.774 --> 01:13:37.850
Dr. Bailey,

01:13:38.902 --> 01:13:41.108
I came here to tell you that

01:13:41.822 --> 01:13:43.695
I'm interested in someone.

01:13:45.367 --> 01:13:47.158
A man.

01:13:47.244 --> 01:13:49.201
<i>Well, he's almost a man.</i>

01:13:49.913 --> 01:13:51.787
What do you mean?

01:13:51.873 --> 01:13:54.162
He's only 22 years old.

01:13:55.877 --> 01:14:00.788
But it's not like I'm rushing into
anything. I've known him for 26 years!

01:14:00.882 --> 01:14:02.958
Corinne...

01:14:03.051 --> 01:14:05.293
It's a little complicated.

01:14:11.935 --> 01:14:15.719
Uh, is this someone that
you've told me about before?

01:14:16.523 --> 01:14:18.147
No.

01:14:18.233 --> 01:14:20.309
We only met three days ago.

01:14:21.444 --> 01:14:24.398
But you just said that
you've known him 26 years.

01:14:24.489 --> 01:14:26.482
He used to be a different person.

01:14:27.284 --> 01:14:29.323
Uh... he's changed a lot.

01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:32.534
Dr. Bailey,

01:14:33.582 --> 01:14:38.409
I don't know if it's just his body
I'm attracted to or his soul,

01:14:40.589 --> 01:14:42.665
or if it's just... me.

01:14:46.553 --> 01:14:48.629
I'm feeling

01:14:49.472 --> 01:14:51.549
generally

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:55.551
attractive.

01:14:56.271 --> 01:14:57.765
The truth is,

01:14:59.566 --> 01:15:02.567
I'm so ripe, I'm about
to fall off the vine!

01:15:03.612 --> 01:15:07.230
Well, I-I-I feel this is a very

01:15:07.324 --> 01:15:09.400
positive step. Uh...

01:15:09.493 --> 01:15:12.577
Now, I sense some hesitation

01:15:12.662 --> 01:15:15.580
in entering into a
relationship with

01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:19.034
a younger man, but this
is perfectly natural.

01:15:19.127 --> 01:15:23.291
Society inhibits us, but
feelings are feelings

01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:28.043
and you are crossing a
very important threshold.

01:15:28.637 --> 01:15:34.058
<i>♪ May the good Lord be with you
down every road you roam. ♪</i>

01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:43.524
<i>♪ And may sunshine and happiness surround
you when you're far from home. ♪</i>

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:52.992

01:15:57.123 --> 01:16:02.414

<i>♪ Forever young. ♪</i>

01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.766
We used to love to come here,

01:16:23.859 --> 01:16:25.898
you and I.

01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:27.895
<i>Louie and I.</i>

01:16:27.988 --> 01:16:30.064
Do you remember?

01:16:31.616 --> 01:16:33.276
No.

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:35.986
What do you remember?

01:16:37.038 --> 01:16:41.416
Uh... it's kind of like a dream
coming back, bits and pieces.

01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:45.748
But I especially remember people
that I really love, like you and Philip.

01:16:51.386 --> 01:16:53.094
Thanks.

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.006
Come on!

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.847
- There you go.
- Thanks. How much?

01:16:57.934 --> 01:17:00.971
That's all right, ma'am.
Your son already paid.

01:17:05.317 --> 01:17:08.816
- What was Miranda like at ten?
- At ten? Precocious.

01:17:08.904 --> 01:17:11.739
Opinionated. Fiercely independent.

01:17:11.823 --> 01:17:14.908
She got braces then, which
she removed with pliers

01:17:14.993 --> 01:17:18.029
after wearing them
for about an hour!

01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:24.076
I remember Philip telling her, "All great
beauties must suffer and sacrifice!"

01:17:25.045 --> 01:17:27.084
You...!

01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:37.086
Hi!

01:17:44.981 --> 01:17:47.104
I want to have at least...
two more.

01:17:47.192 --> 01:17:48.852
Babies?!

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:51.687
It's not too late, is it?

01:17:52.864 --> 01:17:54.442
No...

01:17:57.994 --> 01:18:00.070
Can we start... tonight?

01:18:26.022 --> 01:18:28.098
Are you sure?

01:18:28.191 --> 01:18:31.026
I asked him is there anybody
else, and he said yes.

01:18:31.052 --> 01:18:33.341
To me, that's pretty
compelling evidence.

01:18:33.405 --> 01:18:36.074
- He admired your molar.
- What?

01:18:36.158 --> 01:18:38.827
Yesterday at my house. Your X-rays.

01:18:41.163 --> 01:18:45.789
You know, one minute he's there
with you and the next minute...

01:18:46.501 --> 01:18:48.577
And I think I'm in love with him.

01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:52.004
I know it sounds ridiculous.
I've only known him a few days,

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:56.254
but I mean, I've never felt
this way for anybody before.

01:18:56.428 --> 01:18:59.713
I mean, if he asked me to
marry him I'd say yes.

01:19:01.016 --> 01:19:05.678
The weird thing is, he treats me like I'm
five, like I'm his daughter or something.

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:08.855
Well, don't give up.
These things take time.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.016
Believe me!

01:19:13.195 --> 01:19:15.520
- Philip...
- What?

01:19:16.031 --> 01:19:20.111
Why don't you just attack Mom once
and for all and get it over with?

01:19:54.736 --> 01:19:56.065
That you?

01:19:58.573 --> 01:20:01.243
What's he doing here?

01:20:01.326 --> 01:20:03.995
Philip! What are you doing?

01:20:04.079 --> 01:20:05.822
Hi!

01:20:05.914 --> 01:20:08.868
Creating the most spectacular
veal parmigiane!

01:20:12.671 --> 01:20:13.853
Soon.

01:20:15.079 --> 01:20:18.007
I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a cold shower.

01:20:23.306 --> 01:20:25.928
Uh, Miranda called. She's
gonna be working late.

01:20:27.894 --> 01:20:30.646
- Can I help?
- No.

01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:33.515
God, you look beautiful!

01:20:39.072 --> 01:20:41.646
Philip, you got a haircut!

01:20:41.741 --> 01:20:44.493
- What's the occasion?
- You.

01:20:49.499 --> 01:20:51.575
Oh, Philip!

01:20:57.966 --> 01:20:59.709
Oh, God!

01:21:01.401 --> 01:21:02.959
Oh, the gorilla!

01:21:02.985 --> 01:21:05.615
Tell him about the time you were a
gorilla at Miranda's birthday party.

01:21:05.682 --> 01:21:08.007
And scared them all
practically to death!

01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:10.224
I think we'll spare him that one.

01:21:10.312 --> 01:21:13.099
How am I doing?

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.606
- More champagne, cherie?
- Mais oui

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:36.200
Philip, you've outdone yourself!

01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:38.929
This is one of the greatest
meals I've ever had.

01:21:38.955 --> 01:21:40.029
Thank you, Alex.

01:21:40.091 --> 01:21:41.550
I'll drink to that!

01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:45.051
You must be exhausted.
You certainly look exhausted.

01:21:45.138 --> 01:21:47.100
You look out of it. I wish
you didn't have to go.

01:21:47.126 --> 01:21:48.415
Me too!

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.136
Thanks for everything.

01:21:55.941 --> 01:21:58.017
We'll see you. Feel better!

- Philip!
- It's not what you think!

01:23:42.672 --> 01:23:45.460
That's good!
You smarmy little bastard!

01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.626
Philip, no! Philip...!

01:23:48.386 --> 01:23:50.130
Philip!

01:23:50.222 --> 01:23:53.472
This is not what you think!
It's something else entirely!

01:23:53.558 --> 01:23:56.643
Alex is Louie. Reincarnated.

01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:04.518
I didn't believe it
either at first.

01:24:04.611 --> 01:24:07.980
- Oh, Philip, isn't it a miracle?
- He told you that?

01:24:08.073 --> 01:24:11.489
- Pass yourself off as her dead husband?
- No!

01:24:11.576 --> 01:24:13.403
Very cute!

01:24:13.495 --> 01:24:15.571
No!

01:24:16.164 --> 01:24:18.240
Philip!

01:24:20.377 --> 01:24:22.702
- Stop it!
- Get off!

01:24:22.796 --> 01:24:25.963
<i>- No!
- I am Louie!</i>

01:24:26.049 --> 01:24:27.757
It's true! It's me!

01:24:27.843 --> 01:24:30.131
He can prove it. Go on, honey!

01:24:31.346 --> 01:24:33.754
Oh, spare me "honey". Corinne...

01:24:35.308 --> 01:24:38.345
He's got you figured out.
All he wants is your money.

01:24:38.436 --> 01:24:41.640
You're wrong. He wants my body!

01:24:43.984 --> 01:24:46.439
- I'm Louie!
- Yeah, and I'm Cleopatra!

01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:48.271
- You're not.
- Stop it!

01:24:48.363 --> 01:24:50.486
You fight like her, though!

01:24:54.119 --> 01:24:56.195
Stop it, stop it!

01:25:00.292 --> 01:25:02.830
Listen! Listen, you
stubborn son of a bitch!

01:25:02.919 --> 01:25:05.218
The day Corinne and I got
married, at the altar,

01:25:05.244 --> 01:25:07.072
you told me you were
in love with her.

01:25:07.132 --> 01:25:09.884
- What are you, CIA?
- Do you deny it?

01:25:13.221 --> 01:25:14.419
No.

01:25:14.514 --> 01:25:16.341
Philip...

01:25:18.727 --> 01:25:20.803
Oh, Philip!

01:25:24.274 --> 01:25:27.857
Now, look, I'm just a
dumb newspaperman.

01:25:28.904 --> 01:25:33.067
I believe Monday follows Sunday,
I believe that summer follows spring.

01:25:33.158 --> 01:25:35.696
I believe in God and glasnost

01:25:35.785 --> 01:25:38.277
I believe in things you can touch.

01:25:41.917 --> 01:25:43.743
In my whole life,

01:25:43.835 --> 01:25:45.911
I have never met

01:25:46.213 --> 01:25:49.048
a more devious or clever scoundrel.

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.301
Now get out of here
before I throw you out!

01:25:57.557 --> 01:25:59.431
Philip!

01:26:01.228 --> 01:26:03.304
Philip! Philip!

01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:06.265
What did you do that for?!

01:26:06.358 --> 01:26:07.816
He was trying to kill me!

01:26:07.901 --> 01:26:10.772
He's twice your age and in
his heart attack years.

01:26:10.862 --> 01:26:14.278
- You could have killed him!
- He's just passed out.

01:26:14.366 --> 01:26:16.442
How could you?!

01:26:18.453 --> 01:26:20.529
Whose side are you on, anyway?

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.379
Yours! But I could never have made it
through the last 23 years without Philip.

01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:31.335
- He's sleeping like a baby. Can't we...?
- No!

01:26:31.424 --> 01:26:35.173
I am old enough to be your mother.
Now go to your room, Alex!

01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:37.923
Go to my room.

01:26:53.029 --> 01:26:55.069
Oh, Philip!

01:26:55.157 --> 01:26:57.233
Dear Philip!

01:27:02.038 --> 01:27:04.874
If anything ever
happened to you, I...

01:28:34.172 --> 01:28:36.628
<i>I must have been out of my mind.</i>

01:28:36.716 --> 01:28:38.792
<i>Forgive me my darling.</i>

01:28:38.885 --> 01:28:40.961
<i>I'll be there at midnight.</i>

01:29:37.903 --> 01:29:39.979
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.

01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:57.708
Oh, God! Oh...

01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:17.725
Shoes off...

01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:49.567
Wha...?

01:31:51.828 --> 01:31:53.904
Oh, Louie!

01:31:53.997 --> 01:31:56.073
"Louie"?

01:31:57.542 --> 01:32:00.033
Philip?! What are you doing here?

01:32:00.837 --> 01:32:02.913
I'm not sure.

01:32:03.006 --> 01:32:05.212
- Whatever just happened was...
- A miracle.

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.376
We almost... We could have...

01:32:07.469 --> 01:32:09.545
- We still can.
- I have to go!

01:32:11.097 --> 01:32:13.933
- Good night.
- No! No, I'm not gonna let you go.

01:32:23.568 --> 01:32:25.644
What are you doing?

01:32:25.737 --> 01:32:30.280
I'm finding out once and for all what
it feels like to hold the woman I love,

01:32:30.367 --> 01:32:32.324
have always loved,

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:35.411
and will always love,
till the day I die.

01:32:51.012 --> 01:32:53.301
I love you, Corinne.

01:32:54.975 --> 01:32:57.051
Why didn't you ever tell me?

01:32:57.894 --> 01:33:00.385
- How could I?
- All these years,

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.556
Louie was always there with us.

01:33:02.649 --> 01:33:04.440
Every moment.

01:33:04.526 --> 01:33:06.353
In your heart.

01:33:06.444 --> 01:33:08.104
<i>In my heart.</i>

01:33:08.196 --> 01:33:09.856
In the air.

01:33:22.794 --> 01:33:24.870
But I don't feel him here now.

01:33:28.216 --> 01:33:29.876
No.

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:13.718
Mother?

01:34:13.803 --> 01:34:15.084
Miranda?

01:34:16.515 --> 01:34:18.388
Miranda...!

01:34:21.228 --> 01:34:23.801
- Morning.
- I don't believe this!

01:34:24.981 --> 01:34:27.733
This is amazing! This is wonderful.

01:34:31.112 --> 01:34:32.655
I have to go.

01:34:34.407 --> 01:34:36.530
I want details.

01:34:38.119 --> 01:34:40.159
Congratulations!
What happened to Alex?

01:34:59.933 --> 01:35:02.009
Miranda! Psst!

01:35:02.102 --> 01:35:03.893
Miranda!

01:35:07.274 --> 01:35:08.851
Hi.

01:35:08.942 --> 01:35:11.018
All rise!

01:35:13.155 --> 01:35:15.942
This court is now in session,

01:35:16.032 --> 01:35:19.448
the Honorable Judge
Harrison Fenwick presiding.

01:35:21.746 --> 01:35:23.822
Morning.

01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:26.742
Please be seated.

01:35:31.339 --> 01:35:35.040
- The clerk will call the case.
- Your Honor,

01:35:35.135 --> 01:35:40.342
the case of the United States
versus Lawrence Garber.

01:35:42.309 --> 01:35:45.393
<i>Without that evidence the counts against
Tony Bonino are out the window.</i>

01:35:46.771 --> 01:35:50.686
<i>Bonino is one of the most cunning and
powerful individuals in organized crime.</i>

01:35:52.944 --> 01:35:56.444
- Request permission to approach.
- Alex...!

01:35:57.324 --> 01:35:59.281
I know about you and
Anthony Bonino.

01:36:01.328 --> 01:36:02.526
It's all right.

01:36:02.621 --> 01:36:04.660
Step aside.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.249
So, still on the take?

01:36:13.381 --> 01:36:16.632
Young man, I don't know who
you are or what you want,

01:36:16.718 --> 01:36:18.876
but you're making a grave mistake.

01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:23.549
Now, I suggest that you turn around and walk
out of here without saying another word,

01:36:23.642 --> 01:36:26.311
or you're going to find
yourself in big trouble.

01:36:26.895 --> 01:36:31.224
I worshiped you, you son of
a bitch. You let Bonino walk!

01:36:32.067 --> 01:36:34.309
Marshall, step him back!

01:36:34.402 --> 01:36:38.068
He suppressed evidence
against Tony Bonino, and...

01:36:38.156 --> 01:36:39.816
Oh, my God!

01:36:39.908 --> 01:36:44.119
..it would have put him behind bars
for life! It was May 18th of 1964.

01:36:44.204 --> 01:36:46.612
- It is Louie, isn't it?
- And, and... shit!

01:36:46.706 --> 01:36:49.707
- Roosevelt Island!
- Roosevelt Island!

01:36:51.503 --> 01:36:53.875
My camera! The day I died!

01:36:53.964 --> 01:36:56.834
The court recesses until 1 o'clock!

01:36:56.925 --> 01:37:01.421
- The camera. Get the camera, Corinne!
- Let him go!

01:37:07.894 --> 01:37:08.973
Alex!

01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:12.520
Alex...!

01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:35.538
Oh, God!

01:37:40.552 --> 01:37:43.043
It's not that I don't love you.

01:37:43.138 --> 01:37:45.214
I do. I always will.

01:37:46.057 --> 01:37:48.133
But...

01:37:49.811 --> 01:37:51.887
people change.

01:37:54.524 --> 01:37:57.276
Not as much as you, generally, but

01:38:00.405 --> 01:38:02.481
we've both changed.

01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:06.119
You're just not my
husband any more.

01:38:07.204 --> 01:38:12.364
Last night I found out something about myself
that I never would have known if it...

01:38:12.459 --> 01:38:13.870
wasn't for you.

01:38:15.462 --> 01:38:17.538
That I love Philip.

01:38:18.465 --> 01:38:22.332
And I only hope with my whole heart
that some day you'll forgive me.

01:38:22.427 --> 01:38:24.503
Forgive us.

01:38:26.348 --> 01:38:29.799
Oh, darling, can you hear
anything I'm saying?

01:38:30.352 --> 01:38:33.803
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's time for his injection.

01:38:54.501 --> 01:38:58.000
Just a little something you
should have had a long time ago.

01:39:05.512 --> 01:39:07.588
I feel better now!

01:39:28.118 --> 01:39:29.909
Where the hell am I?

01:39:29.995 --> 01:39:33.079
In the hospital. With us.

01:39:37.502 --> 01:39:39.578
Do you know who I am?

01:39:40.463 --> 01:39:43.215
You're Mrs. Jeffries.
You're Miranda's mother.

01:39:46.219 --> 01:39:48.295
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.633
Hey, pal.

01:39:52.726 --> 01:39:54.802
You gave us quite a scare.

01:39:54.895 --> 01:39:56.934
How's your head?

01:39:57.564 --> 01:40:00.102
Still on. I think.

01:40:01.693 --> 01:40:03.235
Miranda!

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.565
Hi.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.376
You don't remember any of it?

01:40:27.469 --> 01:40:29.545
No.

01:40:29.638 --> 01:40:33.766
The last thing I remember is Philip
inviting me to your house for dinner.

01:40:34.726 --> 01:40:38.806
And you and I... getting the
corn out of the refrigerator.

01:40:40.941 --> 01:40:42.980
Then it gets a little

01:40:43.068 --> 01:40:45.144
foggy after that, but

01:40:45.987 --> 01:40:48.657
I think it was something like this.

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:52.820
Alex... what about that
other girl you're seeing?

01:40:53.537 --> 01:40:55.613
What other girl?

01:41:32.367 --> 01:41:35.321
<i>So, Finch, where did
you get that picture?</i>

01:41:35.412 --> 01:41:37.654
I can't reveal my
source, Mr. Bradlee.

01:41:38.957 --> 01:41:41.033
I mean, I really can't.

01:41:42.502 --> 01:41:45.124
You're a tough nut
to crack, Finch.

01:41:45.213 --> 01:41:47.669
You're gonna make one
hell of a reporter.

01:41:48.133 --> 01:41:50.209
You start Monday.

01:41:56.558 --> 01:41:59.843
You look so beautiful.

01:42:02.355 --> 01:42:04.597
OK, it's time.

01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:07.443
Come on. Philip's
waited long enough!

01:42:11.698 --> 01:42:13.774
- Mrs. Jeffries?
- Yes, Alex?

01:42:13.867 --> 01:42:16.073
I'm gonna go get the bouquets.

01:42:16.495 --> 01:42:21.869
I just want to say congratulations.
You and Philip make a great pair!

01:42:21.958 --> 01:42:24.330
Thanks, Alex.

01:42:24.419 --> 01:42:27.669
You know, you're the first
boyfriend of Miranda's

01:42:27.756 --> 01:42:29.832
I ever really liked!

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.682
Philip?

01:42:38.767 --> 01:42:41.009
- Yeah?
- I have something I have to tell you.

01:42:41.645 --> 01:42:43.139
Now?

01:42:45.565 --> 01:42:47.641
I'm in love with Miranda.

01:42:48.235 --> 01:42:50.311
I know.
