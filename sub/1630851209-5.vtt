08:16.816 --> 08:19.558
and get, like,
25 of these things each.

08:19.602 --> 08:22.518
COLIN:
Well, I don't usually sleep
with 25 pillows.

08:22.561 --> 08:24.694
SEAN:
News flash. You don't use these.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.260
You buy extras,

08:26.304 --> 08:28.001
and then you sell 'em
to your stupid friends

08:28.045 --> 08:30.221
for a little do-re-mi
for yourself.

08:30.264 --> 08:31.570
Laz, come on.
[chuckles]

08:31.614 --> 08:33.398
I don't use a pillow.

08:33.441 --> 08:35.095
SEAN:
Okay. Well, Mikey.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.010
Come on.
I mean, we used to sleep

08:37.054 --> 08:38.490
-in the same bed.
-MIKEY: Hey, buddy,

08:38.534 --> 08:39.796
I don't know what to tell you,
you know?

08:39.839 --> 08:41.624
All my friends are in this room,
you know?

08:41.667 --> 08:43.103
-No.
-SEAN: You know what?

08:43.147 --> 08:45.149
Fine. I mean,
what does it matter?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.454
Don't buy any, huh?

08:46.498 --> 08:48.152
You bunch
of fucking backstabbers.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.849
Who cares about Sean, right?

08:49.893 --> 08:51.634
-Fuck me, right?
-FRANK: Sean.

08:51.677 --> 08:53.592
[scoffs]
Fuck me? Well, fuck you!

08:53.636 --> 08:55.768
-Oh!
-SEAN: You are gonna regret it
when you didn't get in

08:55.812 --> 08:58.858
on the ground floor
of this superior product!

08:58.902 --> 09:00.599
[Frank exhales sharply]

09:00.643 --> 09:02.645
FRANK:
Fucking Sean.

09:03.689 --> 09:05.648
LASZLO:
You all right, Sean?

09:05.691 --> 09:08.172
Honestly, Laz?
I'm not doing too good.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.174
I was hoping you were getting,
like, 25 pillows,

09:10.217 --> 09:14.918
and I was counting on, uh,
you know, Newman Robinson

09:14.961 --> 09:16.528
or whatever the fuck
his name is.

09:16.572 --> 09:18.486
-Who?
-The guy who looks like a fetus.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.271
-Oh, right.
-And then Nandor
and his boyfriend

09:20.314 --> 09:22.012
don't even show up? I mean...

09:22.055 --> 09:23.187
Well,
I wouldn't take that personally.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.797
Listen, I know. It's just...

09:24.841 --> 09:26.625
Nandor looks like he's
a real big sleeper, right?

09:26.669 --> 09:28.148
I could sell him,
like, 40 large.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.585
And then, you know,
the little guy,

09:29.628 --> 09:31.543
listen, get him for ten,
okay? He's poor.

09:31.587 --> 09:33.240
I mean, he wears
the same cardigan everywhere.

09:33.284 --> 09:35.286
I sense there's something else
that's bothering you.

09:35.329 --> 09:37.680
All right. All right.

09:37.723 --> 09:39.943
You got to promise me
you're not gonna tell a soul.

09:39.986 --> 09:42.075
-I won't tell a soul.
-Charmaine doesn't even know.

09:42.119 --> 09:43.511
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:43.555 --> 09:45.644
-Okay, are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

09:45.688 --> 09:47.864
All right. Hey, whoa, whoa!

09:47.907 --> 09:49.996
I got a cousin like that,
but that's not me.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.303
-Really?
-Yeah, I respect you
and everything...

09:52.346 --> 09:53.870
Okay.
You won't remember anything

09:53.913 --> 09:56.916
about how you attempted
to seduce me just now.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.788
Continue with your tale.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.746
I'm in too deep.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.661
I bought a lot,
a lot of pillows.

10:02.705 --> 10:04.576
I mean, somany.

10:04.620 --> 10:05.751
How many pillows?

10:05.795 --> 10:07.579
[Sean grunts]

10:08.536 --> 10:10.974
-LASZLO: Shit.
-Yeah. I haven't sold that many,

10:11.017 --> 10:13.280
so I can't pay back
the guy who sold them to me.

10:13.324 --> 10:15.369
And, uh, now he's taking me
to small-claims court.

10:15.413 --> 10:17.371
So, how many of these
have you actually sold?

10:18.372 --> 10:19.678
Three.

10:19.722 --> 10:21.201
-[groans]
-Yeah. Charmaine wanted one,

10:21.245 --> 10:22.768
but you can't sell them
to women because...

10:22.812 --> 10:24.204
-it's a men's-only pillow.
-Men's-only pillow.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.553
Says so on the box.

10:25.597 --> 10:27.164
Yeah, yeah,
it's legally binding.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.863
Court date's tomorrow night.
I'm scared, Laz.

10:30.907 --> 10:33.170
I don't want you to worry
about this one second longer.

10:33.213 --> 10:34.693
I think I can get you
out of this hole.

10:34.737 --> 10:38.001
[chuckling]
I could kiss you, Laz!

10:40.046 --> 10:42.222
-[bell tolls]
-NADJA: Maybe we could just put

10:42.266 --> 10:44.355
a sheet or a cloth over it
or something.

10:44.398 --> 10:48.359
The throne is a very important
symbol in the ceremony.

10:48.402 --> 10:49.752
GUILLERMO:
Hmm.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.536
Well, I have an idea, but...
Forget it.

10:51.579 --> 10:53.625
I have too many things
to do today. [chuckles]

10:53.669 --> 10:55.583
-No, go on, Guillermo.
-No, what is it?

10:55.627 --> 10:57.281
Well...

10:57.324 --> 10:58.499
I was thinking,

10:58.543 --> 11:01.372
why don't we put me in the robe,

11:01.415 --> 11:02.721
and I'll sit on the throne?

11:02.765 --> 11:04.114
I mean,
I'm obviously not a vampire,

11:04.157 --> 11:05.768
but they don't know that.

11:05.811 --> 11:08.814
And I think that, you know,
the symbolism will hold.

11:09.772 --> 11:12.426
-Worth a shot, I guess.
-Works for me.
-An elegant solution.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.994
-[bell tolls]
-GUILLERMO: Okay.
-NADJA: I love symbolism, so...

11:15.038 --> 11:16.474
A little bit higher.

11:16.517 --> 11:19.259
[classical music playing]

11:19.303 --> 11:21.435
It's all a big game of chess.

11:21.479 --> 11:25.701
I just didn't say
who was playing who...m. Whom.

11:28.181 --> 11:30.227
Go faster!

11:30.270 --> 11:33.665
Yeah!
[whooping]

11:35.406 --> 11:36.624
I'm getting dizzy.

11:39.758 --> 11:43.109
-All right.
Uh, Iorek the Knavish.
-[chains rattling]

11:43.153 --> 11:44.458
[hisses]

11:44.502 --> 11:45.633
The wraiths
look much more disgusting

11:45.677 --> 11:47.374
than I remember them looking.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.202
GUIDE:
Oh, yeah. We have them
wear special masks

11:49.246 --> 11:50.726
for the Ceremonies of Judgment.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.989
Makes them look much scarier.

11:53.032 --> 11:56.296
Number Five? Wrong mask! Again!

11:56.340 --> 11:58.385
Every time with that one.

11:58.429 --> 12:01.954
Thank you. [clears throat]
So, continuing...

12:01.998 --> 12:03.390
Iorek the Knavish,

12:03.434 --> 12:05.349
you stand charged with selling

12:05.392 --> 12:09.179
your fellow vampires
a so-called magical herb

12:09.222 --> 12:11.050
which you claimed
would protect them

12:11.094 --> 12:13.096
from the ill effects
of sunshine.

12:13.139 --> 12:14.750
NADJA:
Oh, that would be nice.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.403
[chuckles]:
Yes, indeed, it would be.

12:16.447 --> 12:19.102
If it worked!

12:19.145 --> 12:21.017
[bell tolls]

12:22.105 --> 12:24.063
Please watch.

12:24.107 --> 12:26.936
[man and woman screaming on TV]

12:26.979 --> 12:29.939
[Nadja, Guide and Nandor
groaning]

12:34.421 --> 12:36.249
How did you obtain this footage?

12:36.293 --> 12:37.860
-The Crow-Cam.
-[cawing]

12:37.903 --> 12:39.992
-NADJA: Ah.
-NANDOR: Hello.

12:40.036 --> 12:41.341
It's gone.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.648
Nandor, it is clearly vampicide.

12:43.691 --> 12:45.650
Yes, multiple vampicide.

12:45.693 --> 12:46.999
NADJA:
Well, then, we should kill him.

12:47.043 --> 12:49.132
Um, it might not be a bad idea

12:49.175 --> 12:50.829
to kick off our reign
with something

12:50.873 --> 12:52.875
that shows a bit more mercy?

12:52.918 --> 12:54.572
Yeah, hmm?

12:54.615 --> 12:55.834
NADJA:
Is there a cell

12:55.878 --> 12:57.096
that he can be cast away in

12:57.140 --> 12:59.142
for hundreds of years?
[hisses]

12:59.185 --> 13:00.839
-As you wish.
-[bell tolls]

13:00.883 --> 13:04.016
For how many years specifically?

13:04.060 --> 13:05.670
-500 years!
-A hundred.

13:05.713 --> 13:07.585
-150.
-Two years is fine.
Just two is good.

13:07.628 --> 13:10.849
GUIDE:
Our next offender stands accused

13:10.893 --> 13:12.938
of breaking
just about every rule

13:12.982 --> 13:15.593
by which we vampires
keep our presence

13:15.636 --> 13:17.725
on this earth a secret.

13:17.769 --> 13:20.119
-[bell tolls]
-[Nandor hisses]

13:20.163 --> 13:23.253
-[hissing]
-Ugh. Boo!
-DEREK: Okay, so, hear me out.

13:23.296 --> 13:25.211
If you tell me the rules,
I'd be down to follow them.

13:25.255 --> 13:27.039
GUIDE:
If I may please continue?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.085
-NADJA: Yes.
-GUIDE: Thank you.

13:29.128 --> 13:30.782
Derek is a member
of the Mosquito Club.

13:30.826 --> 13:34.133
It was that, uh,
vigilante vampire-hunting group

13:34.177 --> 13:35.787
that I joined accidentally.
Accidentally joined.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.789
-My man.
-GUILLERMO: And then we went

13:37.833 --> 13:38.964
to that weird house
with the vampire family,

13:39.008 --> 13:40.661
and they attacked us.

13:40.705 --> 13:42.098
-SHANICE: Come on! Let's go!
-GUILLERMO: We did it!

13:42.141 --> 13:43.664
-We actually found the...
-[Shanice screams]

13:43.708 --> 13:46.319
And he was left behind.
I-I left him behind.

13:46.363 --> 13:48.887
-Where's Derek?
-It's too late for him now.

13:48.931 --> 13:50.976
I've had to live with that every
day since that night, so...

13:51.020 --> 13:53.239
I-I-I thought he was dead.

13:53.283 --> 13:54.588
-[bell tolls]
-GUIDE: Derek,

13:54.632 --> 13:56.677
you have accrued
the following charges:

13:56.721 --> 13:59.115
turning into a bat on the subway

13:59.158 --> 14:02.205
in an attempt
to scare teenagers,

14:02.248 --> 14:03.859
stealing IV bags

14:03.902 --> 14:06.209
from blood donor centers
across the city...

14:06.252 --> 14:08.689
Also, what are you wearing?

14:08.733 --> 14:10.343
You are wearing
bad vampire fashions.

14:10.387 --> 14:13.477
-That is the most heinous crime!
-DEREK: Well, I mean,

14:13.520 --> 14:17.089
I didn't know where
to get proper vampire finery,

14:17.133 --> 14:18.656
but the Hot Topic at the mall
had some really great stuff.

14:18.699 --> 14:19.918
I mean,
they're fast fashion, but...

14:19.962 --> 14:22.094
GUIDE:
If I may continue?

14:22.138 --> 14:24.792
Feeding on bystanders
out in the open

14:24.836 --> 14:27.143
who have fallen asleep
on park benches.

14:27.186 --> 14:29.014
What's the alternative?

14:29.058 --> 14:30.929
Owning an unlicensed hellhound.

14:30.973 --> 14:33.018
-[Nadja gasps]
-I'm sorry, y-you mean Aspen?
-Hey, boy.

14:33.062 --> 14:35.499
-Nandor, be careful. [screams]
-Are you in there?
-[Aspen growling]

14:35.542 --> 14:37.762
-[Nandor whimpers]
-NADJA: Stay back!
-DEREK: Aspen!

14:37.805 --> 14:40.286
-[growling stops]
-Sit!
-If I may please continue?!

14:40.330 --> 14:41.809
-Sorry.
-GUIDE: We've got a lot to do!

14:41.853 --> 14:43.333
-NADJA: Sorry, yes.
-[Guide clears throat]

14:43.376 --> 14:46.379
Owning an unlicensed hellhound.

14:46.423 --> 14:49.295
Oh, that was actually it.
Sorry. We're done.

14:49.339 --> 14:51.950
-Okay.
-NADJA: These crimes
you have committed

14:51.994 --> 14:54.605
are despicable!
[spits]

14:54.648 --> 14:56.302
What do you have to say
for yourself?

14:56.346 --> 14:58.696
-[hisses]
-I don't know. Whoops?

14:58.739 --> 15:00.785
That was a shit response,

15:00.828 --> 15:02.091
-wasn't it?
-GUILLERMO: I-I'm sure

15:02.134 --> 15:04.354
what he meant to say
is that surely

15:04.397 --> 15:06.660
there's an explanation somehow,
right?

15:06.704 --> 15:08.401
I guess
I just do fucked-up shit now.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.316
That's just who I am.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.753
A vampire that draws attention
to vampirism

15:12.797 --> 15:14.973
is a threat
to all vampires everywhere.

15:15.017 --> 15:17.236
Yes. And, also, I was thinking,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.890
because we showed
the other man mercy,

15:18.934 --> 15:21.110
for this one, I think
we just balls to the wall,

15:21.153 --> 15:22.807
just go fucking crazy.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.504
I agree completely.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.463
-Well, I think that...
-Then we are of one brain!

15:26.506 --> 15:28.378
We sentence you

15:28.421 --> 15:31.250
-to death! [laughs]
-Death.

15:31.294 --> 15:33.122
-I'm sorry, come again?
-GUIDE: Derek, you are

15:33.165 --> 15:36.777
hereby sentenced to be thrown
into the Well of Daylight,

15:36.821 --> 15:38.605
where you will die

15:38.649 --> 15:41.391
-by the rays
of tomorrow's sunrise.
-[Nadja laughs]

15:45.961 --> 15:47.701
[whispers]:
Derek. Hey.

15:47.745 --> 15:49.877
-Guillermo. Hey, dude.
-GUILLERMO: Just wanted

15:49.921 --> 15:52.750
to stop by and say, um...
I'm sorry.

15:52.793 --> 15:54.447
This is all my fault.
I could've done more.

15:54.491 --> 15:56.449
It should've been me
that was left behind.

15:56.493 --> 15:58.060
No, no, no. There's no way
you could've known-- Ah!

15:58.103 --> 15:59.931
-No, Derek, stay away
from the sun.
-Ah!

15:59.975 --> 16:01.324
[Derek groaning, whooping]

16:01.367 --> 16:02.412
I thought that was obvious.

16:02.455 --> 16:04.283
Well, you know, I sort of wish

16:04.327 --> 16:06.329
maybe you'd looked me up and,
I don't know,

16:06.372 --> 16:08.461
given me a rule book
or something.

16:08.505 --> 16:10.333
Is there even a rule book--
Ah! Goddamn it!

16:10.376 --> 16:11.812
Get out of the sun, Derek!

16:11.856 --> 16:13.466
-[Derek shouting]
-No! Just follow

16:13.510 --> 16:15.468
the sound of my voice!
This way.

16:15.512 --> 16:16.774
-[pained groaning]
-Geez.

16:16.817 --> 16:18.471
-[sizzling]
-That is gonna scab.

16:18.515 --> 16:20.343
I thought that would be
common sense to-- You know what?

16:20.386 --> 16:23.607
Here. Put this on and cover
yourself with it, okay?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.652
Don't move.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

16:25.696 --> 16:26.871
Thanks, Guillermo.

16:29.874 --> 16:31.832
Ah, damn it!

16:34.748 --> 16:36.794
You know, I've been thinking...

16:36.837 --> 16:38.187
Oh, great.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.232
I was actually surprised
that you let Nadja

16:40.276 --> 16:43.496
talk you into killing
that Derek guy.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.151
I didn't let Nadja talk me
into doing anything.

16:46.195 --> 16:51.069
Really? And yet you let Nadja
steamroll over you like that...

16:51.113 --> 16:52.723
-Are you done?
-Yes, but...

16:52.766 --> 16:54.333
-Good.
-You said...

16:54.377 --> 16:55.813
GUILLERMO: I thought
I had mastered the game.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.206
Just whispering in
people's ears. [chuckles]

16:57.249 --> 16:58.598
-Between you and I...
-Hmm? [giggles]

16:58.642 --> 16:59.643
GUILLERMO:
Calling the shots.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.297
People have been saying that

17:01.340 --> 17:03.299
you just sentenced
that Derek guy to death because

17:03.342 --> 17:05.388
[whispers]: you let Nandor
walk all over you.

17:05.431 --> 17:07.259
Have a fucking day off,
Guillermo.

17:07.303 --> 17:10.262
No one said that.
Please do not talk anymore.

17:10.306 --> 17:12.960
But I think
I really biffed this one.

17:13.004 --> 17:16.399
JUDGE:
Garry Degen v. Sean Rinaldi?

17:16.442 --> 17:17.835
Present and accounted for,
Your Honor.

17:17.878 --> 17:20.359
It says here you have
representation?

17:20.403 --> 17:21.534
[laughs]:
Oh, yeah.

17:21.578 --> 17:24.494
Have no fear.
Here I am.

17:24.537 --> 17:26.409
Sean has been done an injustice,

17:26.452 --> 17:28.498
and I won't stand for it.
Luckily for him,

17:28.541 --> 17:31.936
I am no stranger to the song
and dance of the courtroom,

17:31.979 --> 17:35.157
for I myself used to be a
barrister on the Queen's Bench.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.507
Mainly representing myself
for crimes

17:37.550 --> 17:39.900
such as soliciting
and pornography.

17:39.944 --> 17:42.773
But I've mainly defended
a lot of hogs.

17:42.816 --> 17:44.296
And horses.

17:45.993 --> 17:48.039
JUDGE:
What is this,
some kind of Hamiltonthing?

17:48.083 --> 17:50.259
-What?
-COLIN: Your Honor, if I may,

17:50.302 --> 17:52.261
New York State Statute 82

17:52.304 --> 17:55.307
clearly states that legal
counsel's attire cannot be

17:55.351 --> 17:57.179
-discriminated against.
-JUDGE: All right, fine.

17:57.222 --> 17:59.224
Oh, yeah.
I googled that this morning

17:59.268 --> 18:01.705
when I saw him
in that old lady's wig.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.752
My only other duty as his
de facto paralegal seems to be

18:05.796 --> 18:08.929
hauling around
his file boxes, which--

18:08.973 --> 18:10.409
between you and me--

18:10.453 --> 18:12.977
mostly contain pornography.

18:13.020 --> 18:16.328
Now, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen,

18:16.372 --> 18:19.288
I feel a huge injustice
has occurred here today,

18:19.331 --> 18:21.725
-and it needs addressing.
-And what's that?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.119
Well, this chap has the hair
of a pedophile.

18:24.162 --> 18:26.686
I've got to be honest,
I haven't stepped inside a court

18:26.730 --> 18:28.166
for about 300 years.

18:28.210 --> 18:30.168
-Objection!
-This is your fourth

18:30.212 --> 18:32.997
objection in the last minute,
Mr. Cravensworth. Overruled.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.217
-Objection.
-What about?

18:35.260 --> 18:36.479
Objection?

18:36.522 --> 18:38.045
So, my techniques

18:38.089 --> 18:39.351
and my methods might be
a bit old-fashioned.

18:39.395 --> 18:41.919
May I approach the bitch?

18:41.962 --> 18:43.312
-[Sean snickers]
-What did you say?

18:43.355 --> 18:45.052
I said,
"May I approach the bench?"

18:45.096 --> 18:47.272
-Ah.
-What did youthink I said?

18:47.316 --> 18:50.188
Right. I'm ready
to wrap this up.

18:50.232 --> 18:55.106
The common man-- whether he be
Neanderthal, troglodyte--

18:55.150 --> 18:57.064
they all deserve
their day in court.

18:57.108 --> 19:00.155
A slice of a fair system,
wouldn't you say?

19:00.198 --> 19:01.504
I think I've heard enough,
thank you.

19:01.547 --> 19:02.853
Judgment for the plaintiff

19:02.896 --> 19:06.161
in the amount of $12,700.

19:06.204 --> 19:07.727
-What's she talking about?
-[gavel bangs]

19:07.771 --> 19:08.946
We lost.

19:08.989 --> 19:10.817
LASZLO:
What the fuck?

19:12.906 --> 19:14.560
-[whispers]: Fuck.
-[door opens]

19:14.604 --> 19:16.867
-I need to see Nadja.
-SEAN: No, no.

19:16.910 --> 19:18.782
-Nadja?
-No, no, bro.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.305
She's not there. Come on.
God, you're heavy.

19:20.349 --> 19:21.306
-LASZLO: I think I'm gonna puke.
-What happened?

19:21.350 --> 19:23.482
Well, he lost a court case

19:23.526 --> 19:25.441
and he took it pretty hard,
and we went to a bar

19:25.484 --> 19:27.051
-to... help him unwind.
-[belches]

19:27.094 --> 19:29.575
-Wait, Laszlo's a lawyer?
-[sighs]: Yeah.

19:29.619 --> 19:32.274
We met some finance guys,
and next thing you know,

19:32.317 --> 19:33.840
double-fisting drinks.

19:33.884 --> 19:36.060
They take off,
we lose track of Laz.

19:36.103 --> 19:38.497
-[laughing]
-They must've gone out
barhopping or something.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.804
Oh, I can't believe
this is the first time

19:40.847 --> 19:45.112
I'm inside your guys's place.
You must do a lot of antiquing.

19:45.156 --> 19:46.244
Nope. Don't touch that.

19:46.288 --> 19:48.333
Jennifer
the Dreadfully Loathsome,

19:48.377 --> 19:51.249
we would like to officially
apologize for the distress

19:51.293 --> 19:53.512
your name has caused you,
and we hereby

19:53.556 --> 19:56.298
grant you permission to
change your name henceforth.

19:56.341 --> 19:58.648
-NANDOR: Yes.
-As requested, you will be known

19:58.691 --> 20:01.041
as Gabby
the Dreadfully Loathsome.

20:01.085 --> 20:02.260
-Gabby.
-Congratulations, my love.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.653
Thank you.

20:03.696 --> 20:04.958
I think we're done, guys.
Excellent day.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.177
-[doors slam open]
-GUILLERMO: Wait!

20:06.221 --> 20:07.700
NANDOR:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:07.744 --> 20:09.311
What is the meaning of
this outburst, Guillermo?

20:09.354 --> 20:11.704
He's supposed
to be ashes by now.

20:11.748 --> 20:14.533
GUILLERMO: The prisoner
was sentenced to death.

20:14.577 --> 20:17.188
And by some miracle...
[chuckles] escaped.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.103
-What are you talking about?
You helped me... Oh.
-Shut...

20:19.146 --> 20:21.323
GUILLERMO: He escaped!
But a-according to

20:21.366 --> 20:24.413
Codicil 18 of the Vampiric
Council Code of Conduct...

20:24.456 --> 20:26.110
I just made that up.
[chuckles]

20:26.153 --> 20:30.288
Codicil 18: The prisoner
is entitled to...

20:30.332 --> 20:32.072
a defense attorney!

20:32.116 --> 20:35.380
-[Nadja gasps, laughs]
-NANDOR: Oh, for fuck's sake...

20:35.424 --> 20:38.601
-All rise.
The Honorable Laszlo...
-[muttering]

20:38.644 --> 20:39.993
Well, you-you know who he is.

20:40.037 --> 20:42.300
My lords and ladies of...

20:42.344 --> 20:44.955
-[belches] jury.
-Ugh.

20:46.609 --> 20:47.784
Eh...

20:50.090 --> 20:51.657
Um...

20:51.701 --> 20:54.878
NANDOR:
Is there any more?
Okay... great.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.532
He's never been very good
with his blood liquor.

20:56.575 --> 21:00.710
If I may quote my favorite
comedian, Monty Python,

21:00.753 --> 21:02.712
[bad accent]:
"We better get a bucket."

21:02.755 --> 21:04.540
[laughs]
He's gonna throw up.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.845
-I think he's gonna puke.
-[belches]

21:05.889 --> 21:07.673
No! Before that,
I think what he was

21:07.717 --> 21:09.545
going to say is that he...

21:09.588 --> 21:14.201
volunteers to take this
young vampire under his wing.

21:14.245 --> 21:15.855
-NANDOR: Did he say that?
-GUILLERMO: Yes. And, of course,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.988
make him, you know,
work off his transgressions.

21:18.031 --> 21:20.251
And also, uh,
vouch for any future,

21:20.295 --> 21:22.427
uh, uh, behavior of his.
Right? Right, Laszlo?

21:22.471 --> 21:24.342
-[groaning]
-La-Laszlo?

21:24.386 --> 21:25.865
-NANDOR: That's a yes?
-That's a yes.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.867
I think it would be
so lovely for him

21:27.911 --> 21:30.261
if you just let him win this
first case, just for Laszlo.

21:30.305 --> 21:31.871
Please?

21:31.915 --> 21:34.309
[sighs] Okay, fine.
I don't even care at this point.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.267
-Release the prisoner.
-[laughs]

21:36.311 --> 21:38.095
NADJA:
Laszlo has won a case!

21:38.138 --> 21:39.966
Very good.
Well done, my love!

21:40.010 --> 21:41.403
-You won your first case ever!
-Well done. Well done, Laszlo.

21:41.446 --> 21:43.013
Congratulations.

21:43.056 --> 21:44.406
Guillermo, you, uh,
you saved me.

21:44.449 --> 21:46.538
Oh, no. Thank your l...
yeah, all right.

21:46.582 --> 21:48.018
Yeah. I guess it was
kind of me. [chuckles]

21:48.061 --> 21:50.150
[loud banging]

21:50.194 --> 21:52.196
NANDOR: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Guillermo, you step away

21:52.239 --> 21:53.632
from that crate this instant.

21:53.676 --> 21:54.938
-[barking]
-Get your hands off that lock

21:54.981 --> 21:56.374
-immediately!
-NADJA: Guillermo,

21:56.418 --> 21:57.636
hellhounds are not
to be trifled with.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.724
NANDOR:
Don't do this!

21:58.768 --> 22:00.030
Did you ever stop and think

22:00.073 --> 22:02.380
that maybe this creature
was just hungry?

22:02.424 --> 22:04.774
-Or afraid?
-D-Don't. Don't open that door.

22:04.817 --> 22:06.906
-Or both?
-[Nadja gasps]
-Don't do it!

22:06.950 --> 22:09.431
-Hey...!
-There he is.

22:09.474 --> 22:11.737
-[gasps] Good boy. See?
-[Nadja whimpering]

22:11.781 --> 22:13.304
He just needed
some love and attention.

22:13.348 --> 22:15.175
-Away, hellhound.
-GUILLERMO: Who's a good boy?

22:15.219 --> 22:16.525
-Good boy.
-NADJA: How is he doing that?

22:16.568 --> 22:19.876
Maybe it's part
of his magical DNA.

22:19.919 --> 22:20.877
-Lay!
-[barks]

22:20.920 --> 22:22.531
[gasps] Good boy.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.882
And he's got an enchanted
nutsack as well, apparently.
