00:32.991 --> 00:35.911
How many times?
Get your nose out of the dirt.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.496
I'm sorry, Sister.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.963
One day your curiosity will lead you
down a path you can't come back from.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.642
"And die in an instant,
in the middle of the night.

00:59.810 --> 01:05.399
His eyes are on the ways of mortals.
He sees their every step."

01:07.442 --> 01:11.572
That will be a demerit for tardiness,
Calvin Evans.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.201
Now, where did we leave off?

01:16.201 --> 01:17.744
"There is no deep shadow,

01:17.744 --> 01:20.831
no utter darkness
where evildoers can hide.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.293
God has no need to examine people further

01:24.293 --> 01:26.753
that they should come before him
for judgment."

01:27.796 --> 01:29.423
Eyes on the board, please.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.969
The verse reads,
"The Lord is the maker of them all."

01:34.553 --> 01:36.263
Sorry to interrupt, Sister Beth Ann.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.098
Children.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.601
Now, we just finished the meeting
with the bishop.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.978
Mr. and Mrs. Smith
are ready to take him home.

01:42.978 --> 01:43.937
Jeremiah,

01:43.937 --> 01:47.816
there are some very special people
who have come back to see you.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.530
Say hi.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.491
Jeremiah. Hi. Let's walk outside.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.576
- Thank you.
- God bless.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.830
Back to your compositions.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.840
"The Lord is the maker of them all."

03:28.083 --> 03:30.043
All right, boys. Load her up.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.383
Same order for next week?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.886
If you can double the output,
I'll make it worth your while.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.928
Thank you.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.724
Careful. Don't spill any hooch.
The bishop will kill us.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.477
- Hey, bring me another empty one.
- Yeah.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.396
Use this as a strainer.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.732
Bottles go over there when they're filled.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.196
Oh, Calvin. There you are.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.532
Everyone is really impressed
with the work you're doing down here.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.327
I think it's time to increase production.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.494
Is that the temperature gauge?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.829
Yes, the one you mentioned.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.497
That's great.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.125
Now, what else do you need?

04:13.545 --> 04:15.255
Put that over here. And careful.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.634
Take it off your arm.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.578
Put that on that second stove.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.463
- We're running out of room.
- Yeah, we need more crates.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.930
- Holy shit, it's a limo!
- Language.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.476
It's a Cadillac!

05:10.269 --> 05:13.605
I bet he's a professional baseball player
or a movie star.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.999
What do you think he's here for?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.127
Don't kid yourself.
I bet he's here for me.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.461
In your dreams.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Calvin.

06:21.507 --> 06:25.594
Calvin, I wanted to take a moment
to discuss your future.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.847
You've become indispensable to me,
and that should be rewarded.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.851
Which is why I'm excusing you
from your daily chores.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.897
Is something the matter?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.777
Who was that man who came today?

06:42.861 --> 06:47.115
I had a feeling he was here for me.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.745
He was here because of you.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.374
I knew it. He's my father, isn't he?

06:55.374 --> 06:56.458
Calvin, I'm sorry.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.129
I told him everything about you,
and he saw you.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.466
But he doesn't want you.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.011
I'm sorry, Calvin.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.558
But what if I could just talk to him.

07:12.558 --> 07:13.725
- He'd see I'd be--
- No.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.354
Look, I care about you too much

07:18.021 --> 07:23.110
to subject you to those hateful,
selfish people.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.740
It's bad enough that you have
to carry their brokenness in you.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.826
That you will be burdened with it,

07:30.826 --> 07:33.912
no matter how good you are,
no matter how hard you try.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.845
Try and act natural but distinguished.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.597
How much longer is this going to take?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.140
Would it be good to do one
with the whole lab?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.767
You worry about delivering us
another tennis trophy

07:55.767 --> 07:58.312
against those sons of bitches from JPL.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.190
- Let Dr. Evans have his moment.
- Of course, sir.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.942
Those cables
on the electrophoresis are inverted.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.360
No. I don't think they--

08:05.360 --> 08:07.821
Dr. Evans, lean a little to your left.
I'm catching a shadow.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.198
I'm certain that I checked.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.282
Goddamn it!

08:12.910 --> 08:16.121
These samples are useless.
This is no way to work.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.833
There's too many people, too much noise,
too many unnecessary distractions.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.044
- Dr. Evans, I can assure you--
- You are completely right.

08:22.878 --> 08:23.879
Tell me what you need.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.256
I need my own space.
No chemists, no lab techs.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.010
None of this attention. I just need quiet.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.763
By the time you get back from Boston,
you'll be all sorted.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.640
Robert, you'll see to it.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.682
Yes, sir.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.269
Make Hastings proud. And then hurry back.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.438
Fame only lasts as long
as you give them something to write about.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.863
So you can see now that every living thing
on our planet,

08:49.863 --> 08:54.451
from lichen to mice to Harvard students,

08:54.952 --> 08:59.331
forms its proteins
from the same set of 20 amino acids.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.294
RNA and DNA may be comprised
of only four nucleotides,

09:04.294 --> 09:11.218
but their chaotic processes indicate
that life is born of random,

09:11.218 --> 09:16.348
infinite permutation,
not stable and efficient amino selection.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.437
Thank you.

09:28.861 --> 09:29.862
Thank you.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.446
Thanks.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.097
<i>Dear Dr. Evans,
I have no background in chemistry.</i>

09:57.097 --> 10:00.726
<i>And yet, after listening to your lecture,
I felt compelled to write.</i>

10:01.226 --> 10:05.272
<i>I find your work fascinating.
Downright exhilarating, in fact.</i>

10:06.023 --> 10:08.942
<i>But I think your research
may be overlooking the mysteries</i>

10:08.942 --> 10:10.027
<i>of the divine.</i>

10:13.030 --> 10:16.533
<i>What if God
is a spontaneous generation?</i>

10:16.533 --> 10:20.412
<i>What if the missing link
between nucleotides and early life-forms</i>

10:20.412 --> 10:24.625
<i>is in fact a force
that science alone cannot explain?</i>

10:25.209 --> 10:28.545
<i>I simply share your affinity
for questioning commonly held beliefs.</i>

10:28.545 --> 10:30.547
<i>Respectfully, Curtis Wakely.</i>

10:30.547 --> 10:32.925
That can go at the end table there.
Thank you.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.229
<i>Dear Mr. Wakely, Reverend Wakely?</i>

10:45.229 --> 10:48.273
<i>I'm unclear
when you are bestowed the title.</i>

10:48.273 --> 10:51.318
<i>As if it bears stating,
I am a staunch atheist.</i>

10:52.027 --> 10:56.156
<i>But regardless of one's views,
only an intellectually dishonest person</i>

10:56.156 --> 10:59.868
<i>could watch a chromosome
undergo the metaphase of cell division</i>

10:59.868 --> 11:02.496
<i>and still believe
that an all-powerful bearded man</i>

11:02.496 --> 11:04.373
<i>in the sky designed it that way.</i>

11:05.958 --> 11:08.085
<i>But please, convince me otherwise.</i>

11:08.085 --> 11:10.420
<i>I've never been one to shy away
from a good debate.</i>

11:11.004 --> 11:12.548
<i>Yours, Calvin Evans.</i>

11:15.467 --> 11:18.679
<i>Dear Dr. Evans,
Thank you for your response.</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:22.015
<i>I have never had the pleasure
of watching a chromosome in metaphase,</i>

11:22.015 --> 11:24.059
<i>so I will admit to my bias.</i>

11:26.812 --> 11:28.730
<i>But I believe that the mystical</i>

11:28.730 --> 11:31.775
<i>and the natural
are not fundamentally opposed.</i>

11:32.651 --> 11:38.407
<i>The way I see it, science is the how
and religion is the why.</i>

11:47.332 --> 11:48.959
<i>Rather than argue this with you,</i>

11:48.959 --> 11:51.670
<i>I thought I would leave it
to Charles Darwin,</i>

11:51.670 --> 11:55.841
<i>who proved that science
is the how and the why.</i>

11:59.887 --> 12:02.306
Do you hear that?
Is that Charlie Parker playing?

12:02.306 --> 12:06.393
Ah, yes. My archnemesis.
The other Charlie in your life.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.812
Oh, my love. It's no contest.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.357
These people got taste.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.114
Probably can't hear over the music.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.791
Harr, we should go back.

12:29.791 --> 12:30.876
Nonsense.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.336
No, he's a white fella.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.631
I am. How can I help you?

12:36.715 --> 12:38.425
Welcome to Sugar Hill, neighbor.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.054
Thank you.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.307
Come inside.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.817
- There you go.
- Thank you.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.112
So...

13:02.115 --> 13:03.617
Was that Parker I heard you playing?

13:04.201 --> 13:07.329
Oh, yeah, good ear.
It's the B side actually.

13:08.080 --> 13:12.459
Don Byas's single. Here.
Take it. Give it a listen.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.753
I couldn't.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.880
She only says that
when she's definitely gonna do something.

13:18.924 --> 13:23.887
I don't mean to pry,
but how did you end up in this area?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.933
I found this place
on one of my runs actually.

13:28.851 --> 13:29.935
What kind of run?

13:31.478 --> 13:36.024
Just jogging. You know, exercise.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.778
Must be a white-people thing.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.867
We're only 5.2 miles
from where I work, so...

13:44.867 --> 13:48.704
Is the work that's 5.2 miles
away the Hastings Laboratory?

13:48.704 --> 13:50.414
Yeah. I'm a chemist there.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.792
And what do you do?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.752
I'm a resident intern at Kaiser Hospital.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.838
Yeah.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.594
And I'm a legal aid in the offices
of Hollis, Morrison and Douglas.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.264
This is great.

14:07.264 --> 14:11.143
That's great. I-- Yeah. You know, I--

14:11.727 --> 14:15.230
They did some press on me,
and ever since then,

14:15.230 --> 14:17.065
I've been getting all sorts
of correspondence.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.944
You know, religious threats,
proffers of marriage.

14:20.944 --> 14:25.032
Even though my parents are dead,
people pretending to be my family.

14:25.949 --> 14:30.454
They seem to have confused being a chemist
with being a Rockefeller.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.583
What-- Can you-- I don't know.
Can you help me with this?

14:34.583 --> 14:37.169
Well, firstly, I'm a legal aid
and not an attorney.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.171
Smartest attorney you'll ever meet.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.799
But in my non-legally-binding opinion,

14:44.051 --> 14:47.304
well, we could issue individual cease
and desist letters.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.097
Yes!

14:49.598 --> 14:53.810
I would love for them to cease
and then for them to desist.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
Okay.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.608
<i>I'd like you to meet my new secretary...</i>

14:59.608 --> 15:01.693
- <i>Well, hello, everybody.</i>
- <i>Hi, Gracie.</i>

15:03.612 --> 15:06.657
<i>So you're the girl
Harry Morton's chasing after.</i>

15:07.658 --> 15:09.243
<i>Gracie, this is Harry's secretary.</i>

15:09.826 --> 15:12.204
<i>Really?
Well, you're silly to chase after him.</i>

15:12.204 --> 15:13.288
<i>She's much prettier.</i>

15:25.175 --> 15:26.969
- Really now?
- She hasn't talked to you

15:26.969 --> 15:27.886
in over a week,

15:27.886 --> 15:29.638
she assumed you must have died.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.140
That's all with that woman.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.477
I will call her
when I am good and ready. Excuse me.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.520
I have the answer.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.564
- I have the answer.
- Me too.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.150
I got the answer.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.236
Just call on the doctor.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.239
See. No!

15:54.705 --> 15:57.457
<i>Dear Dr. Evans,
Thank you so much for the gift.</i>

15:58.166 --> 15:59.293
<i>I've been enjoying the read,</i>

15:59.293 --> 16:02.754
<i>and my daughter keeps stealing it from me
to color in the pictures of the birds.</i>

16:04.047 --> 16:07.092
<i>While I don't think
Darwin intended for his greatest work</i>

16:07.092 --> 16:09.428
<i>to be used as a coloring book,</i>

16:09.428 --> 16:11.597
<i>I'm glad it's getting use
from the whole family.</i>

16:12.931 --> 16:14.850
<i>Do you have children of your own?</i>

16:14.850 --> 16:18.187
<i>Aside from the occasional tantrum
and damage to personal property,</i>

16:18.187 --> 16:19.104
<i>I'm a big advocate.</i>

16:20.022 --> 16:21.315
<i>To answer your question,</i>

16:21.315 --> 16:25.235
<i>I have no wife, no children,
no obligations.</i>

16:25.235 --> 16:27.863
<i>I'm married to my work,
and that's the way I prefer it.</i>

16:29.990 --> 16:32.367
<i>If there's one thing
that Darwin and I agree on,</i>

16:32.367 --> 16:34.703
<i>it's that man is not meant to be alone.</i>

16:35.204 --> 16:37.623
<i>Are you aware
that in</i> The Descent of Man

16:37.623 --> 16:39.666
<i>he mentions love 95 times?</i>

16:39.666 --> 16:40.667
Uh-oh.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.629
<i>Exposing the experiment
of your life to outside variables</i>

16:43.629 --> 16:47.257
<i>might just yield a result that surprises
and delights.</i>

16:48.759 --> 16:54.181
<i>So, I implore you, do not rule anything
or anyone out just yet.</i>

16:55.224 --> 16:56.225
<i>Food for thought, my friend.</i>

16:57.935 --> 16:59.394
Sorry that took a second.

16:59.895 --> 17:04.358
I bumped into a coworker in the bathroom.
What a funny coincidence.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.817
What coincidence?

17:06.652 --> 17:09.238
I just mean it's a small world sometimes.

17:09.905 --> 17:13.450
Me seeing her, you and I here tonight.

17:13.450 --> 17:17.496
It's more of an unremarkable
statistical likelihood, right?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.330
I mean, most people eat dinner

17:19.330 --> 17:21.250
between the hours of six
and eight o'clock,

17:21.250 --> 17:23.669
and there's only four restaurants
in the area.

17:23.669 --> 17:26.003
If you and your friend live nearby, then

17:26.588 --> 17:29.383
there's a pretty high probability
of you bumping into each other.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.636
You seeing her tonight is not
because the world is small,

17:32.636 --> 17:33.971
but predictable.

17:34.972 --> 17:35.973
Right.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.433
Sorry. I think I'm being rude.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.727
No, not at all.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.234
I was so excited when you finally called.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.153
I had the perfect dress picked out,

17:50.153 --> 17:52.698
but of course,
I spilled nail polish all over it.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.909
So I put on this old thing.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.704
Did the fabric have acetate in it?

18:00.581 --> 18:01.540
I'm not sure.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.834
Because if it did,
you should not use acetone and water.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.336
It'll ruin the fabric.
Always use one part coconut oil

18:06.336 --> 18:08.005
to one part solvent.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.425
That's resourceful.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.595
Might be five restaurants in the area.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.684
<i>Personal history
has proven the experiment of my life</i>

18:20.684 --> 18:23.353
<i>does not mix well with outside variables,</i>

18:24.354 --> 18:27.524
<i>and the results are reliably futile.</i>

18:29.276 --> 18:31.403
<i>Someone once told me I was broken.</i>

18:31.987 --> 18:34.823
<i>Maybe they were right. I'm best alone.</i>

18:38.202 --> 18:39.953
<i>I hear the hurt in your voice,</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:41.121
<i>even on paper.</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:43.373
<i>I'm so sorry
that someone said that to you.</i>

18:43.373 --> 18:44.374
<i>I disagree.</i>

18:45.042 --> 18:48.253
<i>But there is no denying that love--
opening ourselves to it,</i>

18:48.253 --> 18:52.049
<i>losing it, falling short of it--
makes us vulnerable to hurt.</i>

18:52.049 --> 18:52.966
Dad.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.843
<i>Normally,
I would argue that it's all worth it.</i>

18:54.843 --> 18:58.305
<i>But I'm afraid I'm in no position
to lecture anyone on faith in this moment.</i>

18:58.305 --> 19:00.891
The doctor said put your jacket on.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.226
Yeah.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.102
<i>My father has cancer
of the gallbladder</i>

19:04.102 --> 19:05.145
<i>and is refusing treatment,</i>

19:05.771 --> 19:08.941
<i>choosing prayer to take away his illness
from his body.</i>

19:09.608 --> 19:12.861
<i>I hate to admit this,
but I'm angry at God.</i>

19:13.529 --> 19:17.282
<i>How can he leave the most pious among us
gasping for breath?</i>

19:17.282 --> 19:19.618
...in his innocence, and questions why God--

19:25.624 --> 19:28.752
<i>I'm truly so sorry
to hear about your father.</i>

19:29.795 --> 19:31.964
<i>I have enclosed a paper
from Yale School of Medicine</i>

19:31.964 --> 19:35.175
<i>that's found a chemical agent
producing temporary remissions</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:37.302
<i>in some patients with Hodgkin's disease.</i>

19:40.931 --> 19:42.599
<i>Apologies if overstepping.</i>

19:46.103 --> 19:47.771
<i>Thank you for your kindness.</i>

19:48.522 --> 19:53.861
<i>I must say, whatever my doubts
and whatever your resistance to faith,</i>

19:54.945 --> 19:57.948
<i>I can't help but see the proof
of the divine in our friendship.</i>

19:59.575 --> 20:05.497
<i>This sort of unexpected connection?
That's God.</i>

20:07.541 --> 20:10.961
<i>I hope you'll continue to stay open
to unknown variables,</i>

20:11.879 --> 20:13.130
<i>because, Calvin,</i>

20:13.130 --> 20:14.923
<i>no one is best alone.</i>

20:32.608 --> 20:35.068
<i>Curtis, truthfully,</i>

20:35.068 --> 20:37.487
<i>I didn't take your words to heart
until now.</i>

20:39.573 --> 20:40.908
May I join you?

20:42.159 --> 20:43.243
You may.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.121
<i>I have met someone.</i>

20:46.830 --> 20:50.250
<i>Someone so unexpected</i>

20:53.462 --> 20:57.216
<i>that her happiness
supersedes my former life's pursuits.</i>

21:05.349 --> 21:07.726
<i>I want to give her everything.</i>

21:07.726 --> 21:09.770
<i>Be everything for her.</i>

21:13.941 --> 21:17.402
<i>She is my how, and she is my why.</i>

21:23.158 --> 21:25.869
<i>Calvin, I am overjoyed to hear this</i>

21:26.537 --> 21:29.081
<i>and not too humble
to take just a little bit of credit.</i>

21:29.873 --> 21:32.584
<i>By the way,
I have some good news of my own to share.</i>

21:33.210 --> 21:35.462
<i>My father has agreed to treatment.</i>

21:41.301 --> 21:43.762
<i>Happy holidays to you and your someone.</i>

21:53.438 --> 21:54.898
Can I help you find something today, sir?

21:55.899 --> 21:58.610
I'm not sure. I was just walking by.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.614
Yeah, I wouldn't know
where to start, really.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.074
Well, what's your girlfriend like?

22:04.658 --> 22:09.621
She's not my girlfriend. She is
something else entirely.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.125
Okay. Take a look at this one.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.259
Now, this is what all the ladies want
right now. Trust me.

22:26.263 --> 22:29.016
No, Elizabeth doesn't want
what all the ladies want.

22:29.016 --> 22:33.145
She doesn't even believe in marriage,
really. Or she didn't.

22:33.145 --> 22:34.229
But that was before.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.565
You know, things are different now.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.483
Everything's different since we met.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.407
Sorry. I shouldn't be saying all this
to a stranger.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.159
No, that's more than okay.

22:47.784 --> 22:51.205
Most men who come in just want to know
what's the cheapest or the most expensive.

22:51.205 --> 22:53.207
I have a feeling that's not the case here.

22:56.293 --> 22:57.669
She's simple.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.923
No, what am I saying? She's not simple.

23:00.923 --> 23:05.844
She appreciates simplicity. Practicality.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.348
She doesn't wear jewelry normally.

23:09.348 --> 23:14.394
But if she did,
it would be complex but clear.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.114
It's not a big stone,

23:26.114 --> 23:29.284
but it is the clearest diamond
in the shop right now.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.702
The most facets too.

23:31.203 --> 23:33.956
Tilt it around
and see how it catches the light.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.209
Yeah.

23:40.671 --> 23:41.755
Yeah, it's her.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.558
Got the red nose on already?

24:00.315 --> 24:01.441
Do you have the--

24:02.860 --> 24:06.029
Did you just flinch?
You're acting very strange today.

24:06.029 --> 24:10.576
I think it's strange
that you think I'm strange.

24:10.576 --> 24:14.580
Okay, you strange, strange man.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.207
Come on, you scrooges.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.586
If I don't see you during
lunchtime carols, I'm writing you up.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.258
- After you.
- Coward.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.024
I thought Six Thirty
could be your running buddy.

24:43.025 --> 24:44.902
Because I sure as hell
will not be doing that with you.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.032
It's perfect.

24:54.828 --> 24:58.332
I have one last thing. It's small.

25:07.049 --> 25:09.134
You should move in with me.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.859
- Hello?
- One second.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.027
I used my key.

25:31.657 --> 25:34.868
- What are you doing?
- Just tidying.

25:35.827 --> 25:40.707
- Tidying? Any particular occasion?
- Someone's coming to stay for a while.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.917
For a while?

25:41.917 --> 25:44.336
Should I carry you over the threshold?

25:44.336 --> 25:46.255
No, that's for marriage.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.675
I bought forks.

25:50.384 --> 25:52.219
Impressive. How many did you get?

25:52.219 --> 25:54.263
Enough for two people
to have a to-go order.

25:54.263 --> 25:56.098
- So, two.
- Two.

25:56.932 --> 25:58.350
Did you get spoons and knives?

25:59.852 --> 26:00.853
Shit.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.606
I am excited to expand our library.

26:05.691 --> 26:08.318
How many times
can one person read <i>Great Expectations</i>?

26:08.318 --> 26:12.281
You have made
the same lasagna dish 79 times.

26:12.281 --> 26:13.740
That is not a fair comparison.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.451
- It's slightly different every time.
- Same thing with a great book.

26:16.451 --> 26:19.246
- How is that possible?
- 'Cause the book stays the same,

26:19.246 --> 26:20.163
but you don't.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.834
Well, you didn't tell me
that it's a magical book.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.962
- Tell me your secrets, magic book.
- No, it only speaks to me.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.547
It's my book.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.718
<i>A new kind of question for you.</i>

26:33.385 --> 26:36.054
<i>How did you ever get up the nerve
to propose?</i>

26:36.054 --> 26:39.683
<i>I've never felt more certain
about anything in my life,</i>

26:39.683 --> 26:43.228
<i>and yet I am completely paralyzed by fear.</i>

26:43.228 --> 26:46.023
<i>Paralyzed by the idea
that as soon as I ask her</i>

26:46.023 --> 26:49.026
<i>to spend the rest of her life with me,
it'll break the spell</i>

26:49.026 --> 26:50.611
<i>and she'll realize
I'm not good enough for her.</i>

26:50.611 --> 26:51.695
Breakfast?

26:53.405 --> 26:57.409
<i>Perhaps the church did a better
job of intertwining love and fear in me</i>

26:57.409 --> 26:58.577
<i>than I realized.</i>

26:59.536 --> 27:03.457
<i>Dear Calvin,
My best advice is not to overthink it.</i>

27:03.957 --> 27:06.543
<i>All we can do on this earth
is love generously</i>

27:06.543 --> 27:08.879
<i>and hope that we are given the same
in return.</i>

27:08.879 --> 27:09.880
<i>None of us is perfect.</i>

27:09.880 --> 27:14.051
<i>That's why wedding vows include the words
"for better or for worse."</i>

27:14.593 --> 27:17.971
<i>Scripture tells us
"above all, love each other deeply</i>

27:17.971 --> 27:20.766
<i>because love covers
over a multitude of sins."</i>

27:21.308 --> 27:23.060
<i>But perhaps it misses something.</i>

27:23.060 --> 27:28.649
<i>In order to truly love and be loved,
you must love all of someone,</i>

27:29.650 --> 27:35.531
<i>including their most difficult truths.
Perhaps especially those truths.</i>

27:35.531 --> 27:36.657
Working on a sermon?

27:38.659 --> 27:41.954
More of a sermon for one.
Writing a letter to a friend.

27:43.413 --> 27:47.668
Let me guess. The godless man of science?

27:48.210 --> 27:50.295
The one who sold me on chemo as

27:51.213 --> 27:55.509
"God's way of restoring
his original creation from

27:55.509 --> 27:57.427
- wayward cells."
-"Wayward cells." The very same.

28:03.433 --> 28:04.768
Some coincidence...

28:06.979 --> 28:09.106
the timing of this friendship.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.984
Well, "when coincidences start happening,

28:11.984 --> 28:15.195
they go on happening
in the most extraordinary ways."

28:15.904 --> 28:17.155
Did you come up with that?

28:17.155 --> 28:20.325
No, that is Agatha Christie.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.661
Boy, you need to quit.

28:25.247 --> 28:26.415
<i>Dear Curtis,</i>

28:26.999 --> 28:31.545
<i>Believing that love can conquer all
is a beautiful idea to aspire to.</i>

28:31.545 --> 28:32.921
<i>I will give you that.</i>

28:34.298 --> 28:37.634
<i>Unfortunately, I fear for me,
it is different.</i>

28:39.344 --> 28:42.848
<i>I have spent a lifetime hiding
the worst elements of myself.</i>

28:44.266 --> 28:47.728
<i>I am terrified to think that anyone would
have to witness my defects.</i>

28:48.896 --> 28:51.315
<i>Especially someone I care so deeply about.</i>

29:02.367 --> 29:03.535
Gasoline is jammed.

29:04.077 --> 29:05.412
Shall I call maintenance?

29:05.412 --> 29:08.165
They expect us to prepare for the Remsen
under these conditions?

29:08.916 --> 29:10.417
Absolutely ridiculous.

29:12.419 --> 29:13.337
Thank you.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.673
How many times?

29:17.382 --> 29:20.010
I specifically redirected
these correspondences to my lawyer.

29:20.010 --> 29:26.141
I cannot work when I am being inundated
by these unceasing and invasive lies.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.351
I'm sorry, Dr. Evans.

29:27.351 --> 29:30.979
- I wasn't instructed to sort any--
- Unacceptable! Who is your supervisor?

29:30.979 --> 29:32.064
Calvin.

29:32.648 --> 29:33.815
Thank you.

29:36.985 --> 29:37.986
Why did you do that?

29:37.986 --> 29:39.571
I just need them to stop.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.952
It's like no one appreciates
what I'm trying to accomplish here.

29:49.122 --> 29:52.376
Right. Well, I will let you get back
to your important work.

30:32.374 --> 30:33.876
Didn't think you'd be here.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.211
Of course I'm here.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.552
You still want to be around me?

30:44.428 --> 30:45.596
Yes, I do.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.639
I lost my temper.

30:48.849 --> 30:53.687
People lose their tempers.
I'm more interested to know why.

31:00.444 --> 31:03.280
Calvin, it's not like you've been spared
from the worst parts of me.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.450
Doesn't make me like you any less.

31:08.243 --> 31:11.205
Well, what if I told you
I feel the same way about you?

31:15.792 --> 31:16.793
Try me.

31:19.046 --> 31:22.090
It's all gonna come out eventually anyway,
whether we like it or not.

31:32.643 --> 31:34.102
Don't-- wouldn't know where to start.

31:36.730 --> 31:39.858
Start slowly. Tell me what happened today.

31:52.955 --> 31:57.376
My parents abandoned me before they died.

32:02.047 --> 32:07.803
Those letters, people pretending to care
about me, claiming to be family...

32:11.348 --> 32:15.352
It's salt on a corroding wound.

32:20.858 --> 32:22.609
I'm glad my parents are dead.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.034
It makes moving on simpler.

32:36.957 --> 32:41.211
It's hard to say aloud
the things we can barely say to ourselves.

32:48.385 --> 32:50.429
So much for starting slowly.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.140
<i>Dear Wakely,</i>

33:35.807 --> 33:38.185
<i>I'm sorry it's been a while
since I've written.</i>

33:41.563 --> 33:44.858
<i>I feel as if I've lived
several lives since my last letter.</i>

33:45.776 --> 33:47.694
Left hand over right. That's good.

33:48.654 --> 33:52.407
Always left over right. How is it?
It's good. Nice.

33:52.407 --> 33:54.785
Your instinct's to put your thumbs
on the end.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.039
Do you know why? Yeah.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.043
Freddie.

34:03.043 --> 34:06.630
Hi. I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.384
Again, I'm sorry.

34:13.762 --> 34:17.266
I don't want to get married,
and I don't want to have children.

34:18.016 --> 34:21.478
Thank you for telling me. Now I know.

34:22.813 --> 34:23.813
Know what?

34:26.149 --> 34:27.150
What you need.

34:30.279 --> 34:34.241
As long as I have you and you are happy,
that is enough for me.

34:42.958 --> 34:46.170
Hey, buddy. Are you ready
to go on a walk? Okay.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.549
Almost.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.802
You wanna lick this stamp for me?

34:54.636 --> 34:56.013
All right.

34:58.932 --> 35:00.475
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.397
<i>As you know,
I didn't want marriage.</i>

35:05.397 --> 35:10.110
<i>And then I found myself buying
an engagement ring of all things.</i>

35:11.153 --> 35:12.487
- <i>I think...</i>
- Very close.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.823
<i>...I was compensating
for what is broken in me...</i>

35:14.823 --> 35:17.367
- Yes, we're going.
- <i>...grasping for something whole</i>

35:17.367 --> 35:18.911
<i>and perfect to give her,</i>

35:19.536 --> 35:22.789
<i>'cause I wanted to be perfect
for her so badly.</i>

35:28.420 --> 35:32.716
All right, Six Thirty. You ready?
Let's go. Come on.

35:34.301 --> 35:36.887
<i>But as always, she surprised me.</i>

35:37.471 --> 35:40.474
<i>She has seen the worst parts of me,
and still she loves me.</i>

35:41.433 --> 35:44.228
<i>Marriage, all those traditional steps,</i>

35:45.229 --> 35:47.773
<i>they may not be for us,
but we are for each other.</i>

36:02.120 --> 36:03.956
<i>We are for each other.</i>

36:05.332 --> 36:07.960
<i>That sums up the whole damn universe,
wouldn't you say?</i>

36:22.349 --> 36:23.433
<i>Dear Calvin,</i>

36:24.351 --> 36:26.019
<i>How can you say you don't believe
in miracles</i>

36:26.019 --> 36:30.440
<i>when a man as certain as you
of being alone finds a love like yours?</i>

36:31.149 --> 36:33.610
<i>It seems to me you may have disproven
your own philosophy.</i>

36:35.195 --> 36:36.697
<i>I am thrilled for you.</i>

36:37.781 --> 36:41.118
<i>My family is preparing to return
with my father to California,</i>

36:41.118 --> 36:43.036
<i>and perhaps we can celebrate in person.</i>

36:47.916 --> 36:49.877
Come on. Hey, come on.

36:51.003 --> 36:52.796
Six Thirty, it's okay.

36:53.505 --> 36:57.426
Hey, Six Thirty, come on. Hey, come on.

37:18.447 --> 37:20.866
What should I do
with Dr. Evans's mail now?

37:35.255 --> 37:37.299
Babe something for you.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.612
Mom! He's here!

38:01.198 --> 38:02.658
- Mr. Wakely.
- Hello.

38:04.034 --> 38:07.204
We called the boys home in Modesto
and are visiting next week.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.288
Can you believe it?

38:09.706 --> 38:11.416
Hello. Good to see you again.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.046
Wow. I had no idea
you were Calvin's Elizabeth.

38:17.798 --> 38:21.760
It's incredible.
I brought these letters he wrote me.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.803
Thanks.

38:23.929 --> 38:24.930
Come with me.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.565
So, what are your plans?

38:35.148 --> 38:38.318
Honestly,
all of this business of Calvin's history,

38:38.318 --> 38:40.195
rifling through his past...

38:41.196 --> 38:42.990
I would never withhold answers from Mad,

38:42.990 --> 38:47.286
but I am afraid of bringing people
into her life that I can't trust.

38:49.246 --> 38:52.457
I get it.
You're afraid of unknown variables.

38:53.625 --> 38:56.211
Calvin really rubbed off on you,
didn't he?

38:56.211 --> 38:59.840
- Or maybe I rubbed off on him.
- Makes so much sense now.

39:02.009 --> 39:05.304
Truth is,
we changed each other for the better.

39:08.473 --> 39:12.227
So, a priest and a chemist.

39:12.853 --> 39:14.688
What do you think brought
you two together?

39:15.314 --> 39:16.690
We both knew how little we knew

39:16.690 --> 39:18.483
and preferred asking questions
to answering them.

39:20.110 --> 39:21.361
What about you two?

39:22.863 --> 39:26.783
I think we found faith in each other.

39:27.451 --> 39:29.494
That's a funny word to hear coming
from you.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.537
How so?

39:31.538 --> 39:34.208
You do know that religion is based
on faith?

39:34.208 --> 39:36.710
And you know
that faith isn't based on religion, right?

39:39.171 --> 39:42.799
Yes, indeed.
You two are perfect for one another.

39:47.054 --> 39:48.722
I didn't know him long enough.

39:50.599 --> 39:51.558
No, you didn't.

40:12.454 --> 40:15.040
Do you know what it means
to temper your expectations?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.124
To measure them?

40:16.750 --> 40:21.672
Close. It's to keep them low,
in case we don't get what we want.

40:21.672 --> 40:23.674
Okay, I will temper.

40:25.509 --> 40:29.972
No matter what comes of this,
I love you, and your dad does too.

40:29.972 --> 40:32.182
Mom, you always say that.

40:32.683 --> 40:35.269
But how can Dad love me
if he never met me?

40:36.103 --> 40:40.274
Because, Madeline Evans Zott,
some things defy empirical evidence.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.159
How can I help you, Mrs. Zott?

40:51.952 --> 40:56.415
Miss Zott, not Mrs.
My father and mother weren't married.

40:58.125 --> 41:00.252
You had a boy here named Calvin Evans.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.046
He was my father.

41:04.006 --> 41:07.384
And does your
father know you're here today?

41:07.384 --> 41:08.927
He passed away.

41:10.804 --> 41:14.099
I see. Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.

41:14.850 --> 41:16.768
My daughter found several demerits

41:16.768 --> 41:19.646
from this institution
in his personal effects.

41:26.695 --> 41:28.280
The name doesn't ring a bell.

41:29.198 --> 41:34.161
You must have some sort of system here.
Records or files you could refer to.

41:34.161 --> 41:37.039
Happy to check. What year did you say
your father was here?

41:37.664 --> 41:42.211
1921 to roughly 1939,
give or take a few years.

41:44.421 --> 41:45.714
Before the fire.

41:46.924 --> 41:52.471
I'm sorry to say that unfortunately
many of our oldest records burned.

41:53.430 --> 41:55.349
Are you sure you don't remember him?

41:56.099 --> 42:00.270
He loved science and books.
He was very smart and a fast runner.

42:00.270 --> 42:04.274
Might I suggest
that you look to the Heavenly Father

42:04.858 --> 42:06.985
to help heal what you're missing?

42:09.446 --> 42:13.200
Mad. I'm so sorry, bunny.

42:13.200 --> 42:18.372
- Bunny, I know how disappointing this--
- It doesn't make any sense! He's lying!

42:18.372 --> 42:19.456
Mad.

42:50.362 --> 42:51.363
Bunny.

42:52.322 --> 42:53.991
I don't want another dead end.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.994
- I'm sorry, bunny. I--
- I know he was here.

42:56.994 --> 42:58.704
There's gotta be proof.

43:00.372 --> 43:01.915
All right. I'll help you.

43:28.817 --> 43:29.818
Mom, look.

43:49.463 --> 43:50.422
What is it?

43:51.798 --> 43:54.927
A lead. You were right.

44:05.312 --> 44:07.272
- I'm heading out.
- Good night, then.

44:07.272 --> 44:09.066
- And don't stay too late.
- Okay.
